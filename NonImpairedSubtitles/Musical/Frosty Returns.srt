1
00:00:09,200 --> 00:00:16,000
Some folks say "If you want to really see
the country, take a bus or hop a train. Ride a bike."

2
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:21,500
Me? I'm an old-fashioned kind of guy, stick
to what I know. Snowflakes.

3
00:00:21,529 --> 00:00:25,149
I know it's not for everyone. But so long
as you pack light.

4
00:00:25,149 --> 00:00:30,000
I mean, and wear at least 3 layers of undies,
it's a lovely way to spend a winter.

5
00:01:09,000 --> 00:01:13,570
If my calculations are right we're about two
seconds from landing in Beansborough.

6
00:01:13,570 --> 00:01:15,170
Nice little town.

7
00:01:15,170 --> 00:01:19,000
Plenty of parking space and lots of cocoa.

8
00:01:21,000 --> 00:01:24,369
Ah uh. There's nothing like the first snow
of the season.

9
00:01:24,369 --> 00:01:28,390
And believe you me, nobody loves it any more
than the folks at Beansborough.

10
00:01:28,390 --> 00:01:30,689
They've got this annual carnival, you see,

11
00:01:30,689 --> 00:01:33,460
and I've been coming to it since I was knee
high to a snow cone.

12
00:01:33,460 --> 00:01:37,930
So when I heard it might not happen this year
well I... ohhh...

13
00:01:37,930 --> 00:01:41,000
I'll catch up with you later, alright?

14
00:01:41,800 --> 00:01:46,800
There's seven inches of that fluffy stuff
on the ground already and you know what that means.

15
00:01:46,880 --> 00:01:52,000
No school! Woo! Alright! C'mon let's go! Woo!

16
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:57,000
I love when the clouds burst open like one
giant pillow fight.

17
00:01:57,000 --> 00:02:02,000
You stick out your tongue to taste 'em, the
snowflakes so soft and white.

18
00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:07,000
I can't wait to make some angels or construct
an icy fort.

19
00:02:07,000 --> 00:02:12,500
You need something to hide in especially if
you're wide and short.

20
00:02:12,500 --> 00:02:17,879
We love the snow! Oh no not snow! We love
the snow! Who needs the snow?

21
00:02:17,879 --> 00:02:22,650
Better than rain. That causes such pain. The
rain you can throw!

22
00:02:22,650 --> 00:02:27,900
When the pipes begin to freeze and everybody
greets you with a sneeze.

23
00:02:27,900 --> 00:02:33,300
What the heating bills will cost! The time
it takes us to defrost!

24
00:02:33,300 --> 00:02:38,400
Oh, I could live without snow!

25
00:02:53,000 --> 00:02:55,500
Holly, why aren't you playing outside?

26
00:02:55,500 --> 00:02:57,310
Wasn't invited.

27
00:02:57,310 --> 00:02:58,500
Neither was I.

28
00:02:58,500 --> 00:03:02,500
But it's excellent packing. Let's go outside
and make a fertility goddess.

29
00:03:02,500 --> 00:03:06,000
Maybe later. Right now we've got to rehearse
for the Winter Carnival.

30
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:07,300
Not again.

31
00:03:07,300 --> 00:03:12,200
Charles, if I'm going to perform for the whole
town every trick's gotta be perfect.

32
00:03:12,200 --> 00:03:15,400
What's that for? Put it on and get in the
box.

33
00:03:15,400 --> 00:03:18,000
Hurry. I want to saw you in half.

34
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:20,700
Charles, do you want to help or not?

35
00:03:20,700 --> 00:03:24,700
Of course I do. But I'm a scholar, not a meatloaf.

36
00:03:24,700 --> 00:03:27,610
Charles, please. I just want to warn you,

37
00:03:27,610 --> 00:03:32,000
I am very ticklish. You won't feel a thing.
That's why it's called magic.

38
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:36,030
There's no such thing as magic. Everything
has an explanation.

39
00:03:36,030 --> 00:03:38,000
The proper term is science.

40
00:03:38,000 --> 00:03:41,500
Now don't wiggle. Just close your eyes and
relax.

41
00:03:41,500 --> 00:03:43,000
Relax?!

42
00:03:43,000 --> 00:03:47,250
It's just your basic everyday cut off your
head in 3 strokes hand saw.

43
00:03:47,250 --> 00:03:48,189
Now, you ready?

44
00:03:48,189 --> 00:03:52,000
Can we at least crack a window? I'm roasting
in here.

45
00:03:53,000 --> 00:03:54,300
Woah!

46
00:03:57,300 --> 00:03:58,500
My hat!

47
00:03:58,500 --> 00:04:01,700
Woaaah! Does this thing have brakes?

48
00:04:01,700 --> 00:04:07,500
I'll be right back Charles. I've gotta get
my hat. Holllly!

49
00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:19,000
Oh I'm sorry. I... I...Miss Carbuncle!

50
00:04:19,780 --> 00:04:22,800
Is this how you spend your day off young lady?

51
00:04:22,800 --> 00:04:25,919
Organizing a game of tackle the teacher?

52
00:04:25,919 --> 00:04:29,100
No. You see, I...I was practicing...

53
00:04:29,100 --> 00:04:32,600
Why don't you save your story for tomorrow's
composition?

54
00:04:32,600 --> 00:04:35,600
Right now Miss Carbuncle has a sidewalk to
plow.

55
00:04:35,600 --> 00:04:39,050
Before you know it this darn snow turns into
slush

56
00:04:39,050 --> 00:04:43,300
and where's there's slush there's ice, and
where there's ice there's broken hips,

57
00:04:43,300 --> 00:04:47,300
and where there's broken hips there's substitute
teachers!

58
00:04:47,300 --> 00:04:50,000
Miss Carbuncle. If you should see my hat...

59
00:04:50,000 --> 00:04:51,520
Not that I don't like the snow.

60
00:04:51,520 --> 00:04:59,200
Just prefer it in it's proper place like on
mountain tops and poetry and songs by Bing Crosby.

61
00:04:59,200 --> 00:05:01,169
Goodbye Miss Carbuncle!

62
00:05:01,169 --> 00:05:05,600
It's no winter wonderland when your skidding
into a telephone pole!

63
00:05:10,300 --> 00:05:12,800
(Narrator humming)

64
00:05:12,810 --> 00:05:14,400
Huh?

65
00:05:16,000 --> 00:05:16,979
My hat!

66
00:05:18,000 --> 00:05:19,950
Oh no you don't!

67
00:05:19,950 --> 00:05:21,900
You wanna take something? Take the tie!

68
00:05:21,900 --> 00:05:23,500
Unless you think I need it.

69
00:05:23,500 --> 00:05:25,500
How do you well dress for this Winter Carnival anyway?

70
00:05:25,500 --> 00:05:27,600
I mean...I don't want to under dress.

71
00:05:27,600 --> 00:05:31,000
But if I could get away with a tank top or
something more "caz".

72
00:05:31,000 --> 00:05:33,400
Who are you?

73
00:05:33,400 --> 00:05:35,270
The name's Frosty. And yours?

74
00:05:35,270 --> 00:05:38,700
Uh, I'm Holly. Holly DeCarlo.

75
00:05:38,700 --> 00:05:45,399
Nooo. Not the Holly DeCarlo?! The world-famous
magician!

76
00:05:45,399 --> 00:05:47,500
Yeesh. Imagine that.

77
00:05:47,500 --> 00:05:49,719
First person I meet and it's Holly DeCarlo.

78
00:05:49,719 --> 00:05:53,810
You must be thinking of somebody else. I'm
not famous.

79
00:05:53,810 --> 00:05:55,390
And not a very good magician.

80
00:05:55,390 --> 00:05:57,719
That's not what your friends say.

81
00:05:57,719 --> 00:06:01,200
I don't have any friends...except for Charles.

82
00:06:01,200 --> 00:06:05,200
One friend is a lot different than no friends
kid. One friend is plenty.

83
00:06:05,200 --> 00:06:08,700
But we always fight. Charles only talks about
science.

84
00:06:08,700 --> 00:06:11,400
He doesn't believe there's anything in the
world that can't be explained.

85
00:06:11,400 --> 00:06:15,200
Huh? Like say, uh, a snowman doing a cartwheel?

86
00:06:15,200 --> 00:06:23,900
Or singing Puccini? Or maybe dancing a mean
mambo?

87
00:06:23,900 --> 00:06:27,450
Holly? Well, there you are!

88
00:06:27,450 --> 00:06:30,600
You locked your best friend in a box and just
ran off.

89
00:06:30,600 --> 00:06:34,450
Now how are you gonna feel when poor Charles
grows up and has to join a support group.

90
00:06:34,450 --> 00:06:36,500
I'm sorry Mom. I ran out cuz...

91
00:06:36,500 --> 00:06:39,260
Here! Take one of these cans and start spraying.

92
00:06:39,260 --> 00:06:41,600
Uhh...Mom. This is Frosty.

93
00:06:41,600 --> 00:06:43,190
Well, I'm sure he is.

94
00:06:43,190 --> 00:06:48,700
OK. Now make sure you aim right at the snow
and hold the can at least 12 inches away.

95
00:06:48,700 --> 00:06:50,029
What is this stuff?

96
00:06:50,029 --> 00:06:53,500
Well, it's the greatest invention since microwave
pancakes.

97
00:06:53,500 --> 00:06:57,300
It's called Summer Wheeze. Watch this!

98
00:06:57,300 --> 00:07:02,430
And you thought you were the only magician
in the family, didn't ya? Huh? Didn't ya?

99
00:07:02,430 --> 00:07:05,159
Lille, how did you get that sidewalk of yours
so clean?

100
00:07:05,159 --> 00:07:08,510
You won't believe this Merle, but I never
had to lift a shovel.

101
00:07:08,510 --> 00:07:10,700
You're kidding. Watch this.

102
00:07:10,700 --> 00:07:13,400
Yeowwwww!

103
00:07:13,400 --> 00:07:22,100
Incredible. So, uh, what do ya say we find
a safer place to talk. Say Siberia?

104
00:07:22,100 --> 00:07:26,870
Removing snow's a breeze with one blast of
Summer Wheeze.

105
00:07:26,870 --> 00:07:33,800
Hmm. Catchy isn't it? I want those words painted
on buses, billboards, large dogs!

106
00:07:33,800 --> 00:07:38,300
I suggest we hang a banner at Saturday's Winter
Carnival.

107
00:07:38,300 --> 00:07:41,800
By Saturday there should be a can of Summer
Wheeze on every shelf.

108
00:07:41,800 --> 00:07:46,200
I'll go to that carnival a guest but I'm going
to leave it a king!

109
00:07:46,200 --> 00:07:48,680
A king, sir? You heard me.

110
00:07:48,680 --> 00:07:52,800
I'm about to give this town the greatest gift
ever...a winter with no shoveling!

111
00:07:52,800 --> 00:07:57,900
No slush! No frostbite! Clean streets and
dry sidewalks.

112
00:07:57,900 --> 00:08:04,700
By this weekend snow tires will be ancient
history. And in return they'll make me their king.

113
00:08:04,700 --> 00:08:07,100
That makes you prince, tuna breath.

114
00:08:07,100 --> 00:08:11,300
But sir, what about the environment? This
product may cause...

115
00:08:11,300 --> 00:08:13,200
Bones! Hit the button!

116
00:08:13,200 --> 00:08:14,500
Ahhh!

117
00:08:14,500 --> 00:08:19,159
Any other objections? Good. We'll let the
fun begin!

118
00:08:26,200 --> 00:08:29,649
Oh no! Don't get upset Frosty.

119
00:08:29,649 --> 00:08:31,000
Upset?!

120
00:08:31,000 --> 00:08:34,200
Upset is waking up and finding out somebody
forgot to give you a belly button.

121
00:08:34,200 --> 00:08:37,400
Upset is finding out somebody stole your nose
to play foosball.

122
00:08:37,400 --> 00:08:43,000
This ain't upset kid! This is panic! I'm two
squirts from being history!

123
00:08:44,400 --> 00:08:48,070
Holly didn't sleep a wink that night. Neither
did Frosty.

124
00:08:48,070 --> 00:08:51,230
Beansborough had suddenly become a scary place.

125
00:08:51,230 --> 00:08:56,180
At least to a happy-go-lucky guy like Frosty
who thought wearing no socks in January was

126
00:08:56,180 --> 00:08:58,200
living dangerously.

127
00:08:58,200 --> 00:09:03,100
Holly knew she had to do something fast if
she wanted to protect Frosty.

128
00:09:03,100 --> 00:09:04,500
Yes!

129
00:09:10,400 --> 00:09:12,000
You gotta be kidding me!

130
00:09:12,000 --> 00:09:13,700
Shhh! Hurry!

131
00:09:15,600 --> 00:09:19,400
Holly! You're gonna miss your bus!

132
00:09:19,400 --> 00:09:20,200
Holly!

133
00:09:20,200 --> 00:09:22,000
I'm going Mom.

134
00:09:23,900 --> 00:09:26,300
Holly's plan seemed to flow without a hitch
until...

135
00:09:26,300 --> 00:09:29,400
Holly! What is that sticking out of your desk?

136
00:09:29,400 --> 00:09:31,700
It's just my lunch...turkey.

137
00:09:31,700 --> 00:09:35,300
Don't you think you should cook it first?
(children laugh)

138
00:09:35,300 --> 00:09:39,250
That's enough! Young lady. A school desk is
no place for poultry.

139
00:09:39,250 --> 00:09:42,500
Unless you choose to present it as a science
project.

140
00:09:42,500 --> 00:09:43,500
I do.

141
00:09:43,500 --> 00:09:46,200
Well then you'll have to wait until Charles
is finished.

142
00:09:46,200 --> 00:09:48,000
Continue Charles.

143
00:09:48,000 --> 00:09:50,970
Thank you Miss Carbuncle. Now where was I?

144
00:09:50,970 --> 00:09:56,000
Oh yes. (clears throat) Snow plays an important
role in our environment.

145
00:09:56,000 --> 00:10:00,940
It is a major source of fresh water for the
earth and without it life on this planet would

146
00:10:00,940 --> 00:10:02,300
soon disappear.

147
00:10:02,300 --> 00:10:04,580
Isn't that right Miss Carbuncle?

148
00:10:04,580 --> 00:10:05,600
Miss Carbuncle?

149
00:10:05,600 --> 00:10:09,300
(Miss Carbuncle snoring)

150
00:10:09,300 --> 00:10:10,900
Any questions?

151
00:10:10,900 --> 00:10:15,800
Yeah. I don't think snow's so important. My
dad says it causes heart attacks.

152
00:10:15,800 --> 00:10:19,800
He must have snow confused with chili dogs.
Any other questions?

153
00:10:19,800 --> 00:10:23,400
I think it should only snow one day a year
for the Winter Carnival.

154
00:10:23,400 --> 00:10:27,600
After that I wish it would melt so we could
have ten months of summer vacation.

155
00:10:27,600 --> 00:10:31,200
(children cheering)

156
00:10:31,200 --> 00:10:33,500
An attractive but dangerous theory.

157
00:10:33,500 --> 00:10:37,100
Ten months of summer and a beach party in
January.

158
00:10:37,100 --> 00:10:38,500
A picnic!

159
00:10:38,500 --> 00:10:40,500
A volleyball tournament!

160
00:10:40,500 --> 00:10:43,000
That's right. No more snow.

161
00:10:43,000 --> 00:10:44,940
Do you realize what you're saying?

162
00:10:44,940 --> 00:10:47,000
Yeah. We want summer.

163
00:10:47,000 --> 00:10:53,800
No more snow. No more snow! No more snow!
No more snow!

164
00:10:53,800 --> 00:10:58,400
Hey! Simmer down now! Where do you think you
are? MTV?

165
00:10:58,400 --> 00:11:00,570
Charles, have you finished?

166
00:11:00,570 --> 00:11:02,200
Yes, Miss Carbuncle.

167
00:11:02,200 --> 00:11:03,300
Fabulous.

168
00:11:03,300 --> 00:11:06,000
Let's go Holly! Bring on the bird!

169
00:11:06,000 --> 00:11:07,100
Holly?

170
00:11:13,800 --> 00:11:18,680
Frosty! What are you doing out here? This
is dangerous.

171
00:11:18,680 --> 00:11:20,620
I couldn't sit in there anymore Holly.

172
00:11:20,620 --> 00:11:23,700
I started getting a cramp then I got this
freezer burn.

173
00:11:23,700 --> 00:11:27,700
You shouldn't be out here. If one of those
trucks comes by...

174
00:11:27,700 --> 00:11:33,100
Nah. I think I've finally found a place where
the snow is here to stay...an ice castle!

175
00:11:33,100 --> 00:11:34,700
Won't be there for long.

176
00:11:34,700 --> 00:11:36,230
What are you talking about?

177
00:11:36,230 --> 00:11:38,000
I just came from my school.

178
00:11:38,000 --> 00:11:43,000
All the kids there were screaming "No more
snow! No more snow!" It was terrible.

179
00:11:43,000 --> 00:11:44,320
What did you say?

180
00:11:44,320 --> 00:11:45,100
Nothing.

181
00:11:45,100 --> 00:11:46,500
I was too scared.

182
00:11:46,500 --> 00:11:50,400
Whenever I try to talk my mouth gets all dry
and my hands get all clammy.

183
00:11:50,400 --> 00:11:52,100
I let you down, didn't I?

184
00:11:52,100 --> 00:11:56,000
You know kid, maybe it's time you tried a
different approach.

185
00:11:58,700 --> 00:12:03,950
Sometimes when the words just fail you. You're
scared but you know they're wrong.

186
00:12:03,950 --> 00:12:09,350
I found that I get much further when I turn
my thoughts to song.

187
00:12:09,350 --> 00:12:14,220
You know why you love this season. The joy
that the snow can bring.

188
00:12:14,220 --> 00:12:19,300
So why should you stop to reason? Just open
your heart and sing.

189
00:12:19,300 --> 00:12:24,200
Let there be snow! Let there be snow!

190
00:12:24,200 --> 00:12:29,800
Need I remind you, the autumn's behind you,
let the wind blow!

191
00:12:29,800 --> 00:12:35,500
This is the time of year to make figure-8's
across the lake.

192
00:12:35,500 --> 00:12:40,200
Such a magical sight when the world's dressed
all in white.

193
00:12:40,200 --> 00:12:45,100
Wooah, let there be snow!

194
00:12:45,100 --> 00:12:47,800
The days may grow short and grayer.

195
00:12:47,800 --> 00:12:51,000
The cold may nip at your nose.

196
00:12:51,000 --> 00:12:55,900
But once there's a six-inch layer, those
soft flakes beneath your toes,

197
00:12:55,900 --> 00:13:01,000
you can't help but want to taste it or jump
in a snowy pile.

198
00:13:01,000 --> 00:13:06,300
Why not build a fort or igloo or find a window
to print your smile?

199
00:13:06,300 --> 00:13:11,200
Woah, let there be snow! Let there be snow!

200
00:13:11,200 --> 00:13:16,800
Close down the schools and let's act like
fools, there's parties to throw!

201
00:13:17,900 --> 00:13:22,900
I thought once you made your fortune, you
could sit back and count your loot.

202
00:13:22,900 --> 00:13:28,700
But now that I've conquered Beansborough I'm
ready to trade this suit.

203
00:13:28,700 --> 00:13:36,500
I want a crown that fits me. I want a cape
that flows. Six yards of fur and velvet.

204
00:13:36,500 --> 00:13:43,900
Right down to my crooked toes. There's no
more snow! There's no more snow!

205
00:13:43,900 --> 00:13:49,000
Look how they love me! The clouds up above
me couldn't compete with my dough!

206
00:13:49,000 --> 00:13:54,800
Let mother nature try to win, I'll give her
blizzards quite a spin.

207
00:13:54,800 --> 00:14:04,900
Just try and stop me. No one can stop me.
Let me kingship begin!

208
00:14:04,900 --> 00:14:09,800
Let there be snow! Let there be snow!

209
00:14:09,800 --> 00:14:15,000
This kind of weather brings people together
so friendships can grow!

210
00:14:15,000 --> 00:14:20,500
Why should we sit around and wait for summer
days to celebrate?

211
00:14:20,500 --> 00:14:26,200
Such a magical sight when the world's dressed
in white.

212
00:14:26,200 --> 00:14:31,500
Oohh let there be snow!

213
00:14:31,500 --> 00:14:33,400
Hey Charles. This is Frosty.

214
00:14:33,400 --> 00:14:35,170
Nice to meet ya.

215
00:14:35,170 --> 00:14:37,800
I take it he doesn't dance.

216
00:14:37,800 --> 00:14:39,100
Doesn't blink much either.

217
00:14:39,100 --> 00:14:40,400
What are you looking for?

218
00:14:40,400 --> 00:14:41,300
Batteries.

219
00:14:41,300 --> 00:14:49,200
Heh heh heh. Lighten up kid. Some things just
can't be explained...like rhythm.

220
00:14:49,200 --> 00:14:52,200
C'mon. Don't make me dance alone.

221
00:14:54,000 --> 00:14:58,500
Hold it! Stop the car! Stop the car! And stop
the music!

222
00:14:59,339 --> 00:15:02,900
That snowman is flaking on one of my sidewalks.
Bones!

223
00:15:02,900 --> 00:15:06,400
Who is that frostbitten clown? Must have come
from the park.

224
00:15:06,400 --> 00:15:12,900
There's probably dozens of those snow critters
in there just waiting to soil my sidewalks.

225
00:15:12,900 --> 00:15:17,000
Don't just sit there you overgrown bag of
lint. Get them!

226
00:15:29,100 --> 00:15:35,600
Phew. I think we lost them. Well? Did you
spray him? Tell me the truth bones.

227
00:15:35,600 --> 00:15:37,900
There's a tuna casserole in it for you.

228
00:15:37,900 --> 00:15:41,190
They're leaving. I think we're safe.

229
00:15:41,190 --> 00:15:42,800
Not all of us.

230
00:15:42,800 --> 00:15:44,700
Frosty, what happened?

231
00:15:44,700 --> 00:15:47,000
Looks like the work of Summer Wheeze.

232
00:15:47,000 --> 00:15:52,579
Oh no! There's hardly any snow left on the
ground. How are we going to help Frosty?

233
00:15:52,579 --> 00:15:57,600
You better think fast guys or I'm going back
to the North Pole in a bowl.

234
00:15:58,900 --> 00:16:02,500
Sometimes it pays to have a man of science
on your side.

235
00:16:02,500 --> 00:16:05,000
Most of us panic in a time of crisis.

236
00:16:05,000 --> 00:16:09,700
Me? I reach for a cup of cocoa. Helps me focus.

237
00:16:09,700 --> 00:16:13,700
But a kid like Charles, well he looks at a
problem as something to solve.

238
00:16:13,700 --> 00:16:17,700
Just when Holly was about to give up Charles
remembered something.

239
00:16:17,700 --> 00:16:22,800
What's that? Snow. I was saving it in the
freezer for an experiment.

240
00:16:22,800 --> 00:16:25,900
But I figured Frosty needs it more than me.

241
00:16:25,900 --> 00:16:30,139
Gee. This place is starting to look drier
than Miss Carbuncle's knees.

242
00:16:30,139 --> 00:16:32,789
Mr. Twitchell's trucks drove through while
you were gone.

243
00:16:32,789 --> 00:16:36,649
C'mon, we better hurry. Holly and Charles
went right to work.

244
00:16:36,649 --> 00:16:40,039
They padded. They puffed. They packed. They
patched.

245
00:16:40,039 --> 00:16:44,300
And by the time they were finished they had
no feeling in their fingers.

246
00:16:44,300 --> 00:16:47,389
But there was plenty happening in their hearts.

247
00:16:47,389 --> 00:16:52,069
But their smiles didn't last when they checked
out of that castle they realized

248
00:16:52,069 --> 00:16:56,900
there was no place for Frosty in a snowless town.

249
00:16:56,900 --> 00:17:03,800
This is terrible. Don't worry Holly. Frosty
will last. At least until tomorrow.

250
00:17:03,800 --> 00:17:06,500
What's tomorrow? The Winter Carnival.

251
00:17:06,500 --> 00:17:08,289
Without snow?

252
00:17:08,289 --> 00:17:13,400
Gee kid. If there was ever a time we needed
magic, this is it.

253
00:17:13,400 --> 00:17:15,400
That's it! C'mon.

254
00:17:17,610 --> 00:17:20,700
Well...will that crown fit me or not?

255
00:17:20,700 --> 00:17:24,800
I could always have the crown stretched or
have my head shrunk.

256
00:17:24,800 --> 00:17:29,500
What is it? A snowfall. Don't fret pussycat.

257
00:17:29,500 --> 00:17:32,500
That's exactly what we need for that carnival.

258
00:17:32,500 --> 00:17:35,500
We are gonna make an entrance. Heh heh heh.

259
00:17:43,900 --> 00:17:49,800
Welcome one and all to Beansborough's annual
Winter Carnival. Heh, Um...

260
00:17:49,800 --> 00:17:56,500
Before the festivities begin I would just
like to say...

261
00:17:56,500 --> 00:17:58,100
Greetings neighbors.

262
00:17:58,100 --> 00:18:01,600
Who says you need snow to have a carnival,
eh? Heh heh.

263
00:18:01,600 --> 00:18:05,000
It's hard to believe that we suffered for
so many years.

264
00:18:05,000 --> 00:18:11,400
The slush.... the frozen pipes... the icy
streets...

265
00:18:11,400 --> 00:18:13,600
It's now or never, Holly.

266
00:18:13,600 --> 00:18:18,000
Summer Wheeze is not the kind of magic we
look forward to every winter Mr. Twitchell.

267
00:18:18,000 --> 00:18:19,400
Call security!

268
00:18:19,400 --> 00:18:24,359
Your product is dangerous. What's convenient
for today isn't always safe for tomorrow.

269
00:18:24,359 --> 00:18:28,900
We need snow just as much as we need rain
or sunshine or clean air.

270
00:18:28,900 --> 00:18:33,510
Little girl, I think your hat's too tight.
Now as I was saying...

271
00:18:33,510 --> 00:18:35,600
I'm not finished, Mr. Twitchell.

272
00:18:35,600 --> 00:18:40,000
And unless you've got a spray that makes little
girls disappear you're gonna have to listen.

273
00:18:40,000 --> 00:18:42,300
You've made your point small fry.

274
00:18:42,300 --> 00:18:47,800
And I can assure you there is nobody here
that finds anything magical about snow.

275
00:18:47,800 --> 00:18:49,900
Don't be so sure Mr. Twitchell.

276
00:18:49,900 --> 00:18:56,800
The best kind of magic that only winter brings
comes in a big snowy bundle that dances and sings.

277
00:18:56,800 --> 00:18:57,700
(Audience gasps)

278
00:18:57,700 --> 00:19:00,400
May I?

279
00:19:00,400 --> 00:19:03,000
Now, can somebody give me a B-flat?

280
00:19:05,000 --> 00:19:09,800
Let there be snow! Let there be snow!

281
00:19:09,800 --> 00:19:15,269
This kind of weather brings people together
so friendships can grow.

282
00:19:15,269 --> 00:19:20,700
Why should we sit around and wait for summer
days to celebrate?

283
00:19:20,700 --> 00:19:26,200
Such a magical sight when the world's dressed
in white!

284
00:19:26,200 --> 00:19:30,800
Woah, let there be snow!

285
00:19:30,800 --> 00:19:33,500
The days may grow short and grayer.

286
00:19:33,500 --> 00:19:36,300
The cold may nip at your nose.

287
00:19:36,300 --> 00:19:41,600
But once there's a six inch layer of those
soft flakes beneath your toes,

288
00:19:41,600 --> 00:19:46,800
you can't help but want to taste it or jump
in a snowy pile.

289
00:19:46,800 --> 00:19:52,080
Why not build a fort or igloo or find a window
to print your smile?

290
00:19:52,080 --> 00:19:56,800
Wooah, let there be snow!

291
00:19:56,800 --> 00:19:58,500
Watch it fool!

292
00:20:02,000 --> 00:20:06,900
Let there be snow! Let there be snow!

293
00:20:06,900 --> 00:20:16,400
This kind of weather brings people together
so friendships can grow.

294
00:20:16,400 --> 00:20:19,370
Well I don't think we even need to vote this
year neighbors.

295
00:20:19,370 --> 00:20:22,590
There can only be one king in this crowd.

296
00:20:27,800 --> 00:20:33,400
Why should we sit around and wait for summer
days to celebrate?

297
00:20:33,400 --> 00:20:38,300
With such a magical sight -- when the world's
dressed in white.

298
00:20:38,300 --> 00:20:43,000
Oohh let there be snow!

299
00:20:44,500 --> 00:20:45,900
Mr. Twitchell.

300
00:20:45,900 --> 00:20:47,600
What do you want?

301
00:20:47,600 --> 00:20:50,199
I want you to know I was just helping a friend.

302
00:20:50,199 --> 00:20:54,800
You got your snow back, Missy. So why don't
you leave me alone!

303
00:20:54,800 --> 00:20:58,700
Any chance you'd want to take a toboggan ride
before you leave?

304
00:20:58,700 --> 00:21:02,100
On the royal sled.

305
00:21:02,100 --> 00:21:04,310
You only live once.

306
00:21:11,800 --> 00:21:13,900
Frosty! Where are you going?

307
00:21:13,900 --> 00:21:16,110
I think it's time to move on kid.

308
00:21:16,110 --> 00:21:19,139
Visit another town. Make some new friends.

309
00:21:19,139 --> 00:21:22,500
But you've got friends...here.

310
00:21:22,500 --> 00:21:25,700
Well, at least one friend.

311
00:21:25,700 --> 00:21:30,300
One friend is a lot different than no friends.
One friend is plenty.

312
00:21:30,300 --> 00:21:33,700
You're right. Especially when it's you.

313
00:21:33,700 --> 00:21:38,100
Don't leave Frosty. Don't worry kid. I'll
be back.

314
00:21:38,100 --> 00:21:41,740
Give me some time to find me a new bowtie.
This time no polka-dots.

315
00:21:41,740 --> 00:21:44,600
Maybe something in a nice blue, not too busy.
Or green.

316
00:21:44,600 --> 00:21:47,000
I like green. Brings out my eyes.

317
00:21:51,300 --> 00:21:53,000
C'mon Holly!

318
00:21:56,800 --> 00:22:00,539
And so the folks at Beansborough got their
Winter Carnival after all.

319
00:22:00,539 --> 00:22:02,600
A tradition was saved.

320
00:22:02,600 --> 00:22:09,300
Summer Wheeze was permanently canned and Mr.
Twitchell decided to make sleds instead of trouble.

321
00:22:09,349 --> 00:22:14,639
He should have known he was no match for mother
nature or a little girl like Holly.

322
00:22:14,639 --> 00:22:21,000
Next stop. Winnipeg. Nice town. Plenty of
parking space and lots of cocoa.

323
00:22:24,600 --> 00:22:29,000
Frosty the Snowman was a fairy tale they say.

324
00:22:29,000 --> 00:22:34,000
He was made of snow but the children know
how he came to life one day.

325
00:22:34,000 --> 00:22:38,600
There must have been some magic in that old
silk hat they found

326
00:22:38,600 --> 00:22:43,700
for when they placed it on his head he began
to dance around.

327
00:22:43,700 --> 00:22:48,200
Frosty the Snowman had to hurry on his way

328
00:22:48,200 --> 00:22:52,500
but he waved goodbye saying don't you cry
I'll be back again someday.
