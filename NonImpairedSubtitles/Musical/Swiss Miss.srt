1
00:01:27,640 --> 00:01:31,600
Mr Victor Albert is the greatest
operatic composer living today.

2
00:01:31,640 --> 00:01:34,640
- You make it clear, signor.
- Don't interrupt.

3
00:01:34,680 --> 00:01:39,280
As his personal manager, l must be sure
that everything is ready for his arrival.

4
00:01:39,320 --> 00:01:41,320
l will make doubly sure.

5
00:01:41,360 --> 00:01:45,560
Enrico? Make sure that everyone
has their costumes

6
00:01:45,600 --> 00:01:48,880
and prepare them
for inspection immediately.

7
00:01:48,920 --> 00:01:51,280
Nothing must go wrong with our plans.

8
00:01:51,320 --> 00:01:53,760
Not only have l rented every room here

9
00:01:53,800 --> 00:01:57,520
but l've provided
the most beautiful Tyrolean costumes.

10
00:01:57,560 --> 00:02:01,280
Every employee with whom
Mr Victor Albert comes into contact

11
00:02:01,320 --> 00:02:03,520
must create the proper atmosphere.

12
00:02:03,560 --> 00:02:06,560
Mr Albert's Tyrolean opera
is to be his masterpiece.

13
00:02:06,600 --> 00:02:08,640
- Do l make myself clear?
- Si, signor.

14
00:02:08,680 --> 00:02:13,520
We will do all we possibly can
to make the maestro comfortable.

15
00:02:13,560 --> 00:02:17,280
Excuse me, signor.
Mr Albert's wife, she's coming too?

16
00:02:17,320 --> 00:02:20,440
No! Absolutely no.
The maestro is to be alone.

17
00:02:33,040 --> 00:02:36,840
- How far are we from Pontresina?
- About 50km, monsieur.

18
00:02:36,880 --> 00:02:41,080
- And to the top of the mountain?
- Two more kilometres to the hotel.

19
00:02:41,120 --> 00:02:43,760
(Practising scales)

20
00:02:46,760 --> 00:02:48,640
Everybody!

21
00:02:49,120 --> 00:02:52,600
# La la la la la la la la la

22
00:02:52,640 --> 00:02:55,640
# Laaaaaa #

23
00:02:58,680 --> 00:03:01,200
- You like it?
- That's fine, Luigi.

24
00:03:01,240 --> 00:03:03,240
Now, let me see your costume.

25
00:03:03,280 --> 00:03:04,880
- Me?
- Certainly.

26
00:03:04,920 --> 00:03:06,920
Why? l am the manager.

27
00:03:06,960 --> 00:03:10,480
l said that everyone must wear a costume.

28
00:03:10,520 --> 00:03:12,520
Even me.

29
00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:16,360
# To the... (Voice cracks) #

30
00:03:16,400 --> 00:03:18,440
- (Giggling)
- Quiet!

31
00:03:22,840 --> 00:03:24,920
Er...monsieur.

32
00:03:24,960 --> 00:03:26,960
Yes, what is it, Joseph?

33
00:03:27,000 --> 00:03:29,720
You've, er, forgotten your trousers.

34
00:03:31,240 --> 00:03:34,040
These are trousers. Tyrolean trousers!

35
00:03:34,080 --> 00:03:36,080
- My hat, Joseph.
- Yes, monsieur.

36
00:03:39,000 --> 00:03:41,440
And remember, Joseph...

37
00:03:41,480 --> 00:03:43,680
no one is to know that l am here.

38
00:03:47,800 --> 00:03:49,480
No one.

39
00:03:49,520 --> 00:03:52,440
- Especially my wife.
- Yes, monsieur.

40
00:03:56,680 --> 00:03:59,080

(Silence)

00:06:21,040 --> 00:06:23,280
(Ringing)

68
00:06:24,880 --> 00:06:26,880
Mousetraps.

69
00:06:32,400 --> 00:06:35,800
(Operatically) # Mousetraps #

70
00:06:38,800 --> 00:06:40,840
Say, why don't we try in here?

71
00:06:40,880 --> 00:06:43,160
Well, that's a very good thought.

72
00:07:13,480 --> 00:07:15,280
Psst.

73
00:07:31,640 --> 00:07:35,720
Why, good morning, madam.
Could we interest you in a mousetrap?

74
00:07:35,760 --> 00:07:38,880
- What kind?
- Any. We have the latest inventions.

75
00:07:38,920 --> 00:07:41,280
- Yes, we have...
- l'll handle this.

76
00:07:41,320 --> 00:07:43,880
- You will handle what?
- Good morning!

77
00:07:43,920 --> 00:07:47,680
- We'll show you our latest mousetraps.
- We don't want any.

78
00:07:47,720 --> 00:07:51,440
- Oh, let's take a look at one.
- We don't want to look at any.

79
00:07:51,480 --> 00:07:54,000
lf l want to look at a mousetrap, l will.

80
00:07:54,040 --> 00:07:55,920
l said no.

81
00:07:55,960 --> 00:07:57,680
l said yes.

82
00:07:58,560 --> 00:08:00,400
l said no.

83
00:08:13,440 --> 00:08:15,560
Don't you dare hit my husband.

84
00:08:17,600 --> 00:08:19,600
That goes for you, too.

85
00:08:19,640 --> 00:08:21,800
Oh, mama, that was nice of you.

86
00:08:21,840 --> 00:08:25,600
Now, if you want to look at a mousetrap,
look at one.

87
00:08:25,640 --> 00:08:31,480
Oh, papa! Mama changed her mind.
We don't wanna look at no mousetraps.

88
00:08:45,640 --> 00:08:47,760
Well, this is your idea.

89
00:08:47,800 --> 00:08:52,640
Coming all the way from America
to Switzerland to sell mousetraps.

90
00:08:52,680 --> 00:08:54,880
Whatever gave you that idea?

91
00:08:54,920 --> 00:08:57,320
l thought there'd be more mice here.

92
00:08:57,360 --> 00:09:01,600
And why should there be more mice here
than any place in the world?

93
00:09:01,640 --> 00:09:03,920
Don't they make more cheese here?

94
00:09:05,280 --> 00:09:09,840
Do you realise we've been here two weeks
and haven't sold one mousetrap

95
00:09:09,880 --> 00:09:12,240
- and we're flat broke?
- We're what?

96
00:09:12,280 --> 00:09:14,000
We're flat broke.

97
00:09:14,040 --> 00:09:16,640
Does that mean we haven't any money?

98
00:09:20,800 --> 00:09:23,800
- You know what the trouble is, don't you?
- No. What?

99
00:09:23,840 --> 00:09:26,320
We're not going to the right places.

100
00:09:26,360 --> 00:09:28,240
What do you mean?

101
00:09:28,280 --> 00:09:31,840
Suppose you were a mouse
and you wanted something to eat,

102
00:09:31,880 --> 00:09:33,760
where would you go?

103
00:09:33,800 --> 00:09:36,440
l'd go where there was cheese, of course.

104
00:09:36,480 --> 00:09:39,800
That's the idea.
Where there's cheese, there's mice.

105
00:09:39,840 --> 00:09:41,920
l still don't know what you mean.

106
00:09:41,960 --> 00:09:45,600
Why don't we go to
the cheese factories to sell them?

107
00:09:45,640 --> 00:09:47,920
Let me give that a little thought.

108
00:10:04,960 --> 00:10:09,680
You take the two small ones in and
come back and help me with the big one.

109
00:10:22,160 --> 00:10:26,240
Don't go away, we've got something
to show you. Stay here.

110
00:10:31,360 --> 00:10:33,360
All right.

111
00:11:05,080 --> 00:11:07,400
Look! Look what you do to my cheese!

112
00:11:07,440 --> 00:11:11,560
What are you trying to do?
Wreck my place of business?

113
00:11:11,600 --> 00:11:14,240
(Shouting incoherently)

114
00:11:17,440 --> 00:11:19,800
Just a moment, just a moment.

115
00:11:19,840 --> 00:11:23,280
Pardon this odd intrusion,
we really meant no harm.

116
00:11:23,320 --> 00:11:26,560
Don't get yourself a-flutter,
there's no need for alarm.

117
00:11:26,600 --> 00:11:29,920
We're selling something that you need
so won't you listen, please.

118
00:11:29,960 --> 00:11:33,600
We'll rid your place of all the mice
and we'll also save your cheese.

119
00:11:33,640 --> 00:11:35,640
- Won't we?
- Save my cheese?

120
00:11:35,680 --> 00:11:38,120
- Yes, sir.
- (Shopkeeper) Cosi.

121
00:11:38,160 --> 00:11:40,160
Fix me a hole.

122
00:11:40,200 --> 00:11:42,960
You put this trap in a conspicuous place.

123
00:11:48,640 --> 00:11:51,200
What you are making holes in my floor for?

124
00:11:51,240 --> 00:11:54,080
The mouse has to have someplace to get in.

125
00:11:54,120 --> 00:11:57,120
Maybe so. What's that cork for?

126
00:11:57,160 --> 00:11:59,400
That's so the mouse can't get out.

127
00:12:03,280 --> 00:12:06,280
What you are making
another hole in my floor for?

128
00:12:06,320 --> 00:12:10,440
That's because a mouse
never comes out of the same hole twice.

129
00:12:10,480 --> 00:12:12,480
Oh, is that so?

130
00:12:15,080 --> 00:12:17,080
Emile, come here.

131
00:12:18,680 --> 00:12:21,040
Shh, shh. Excuse, please.

132
00:12:25,040 --> 00:12:28,400
Why don't we make a lot of holes?
lt'll save time.

133
00:12:28,440 --> 00:12:31,040
That's a good idea. l'll help you.

134
00:12:31,080 --> 00:12:34,720
What are those men doing to our floor?

135
00:12:34,760 --> 00:12:37,360
They are trying to sell me mousetraps.

136
00:12:37,400 --> 00:12:40,400
Don't you waste
any good money on mousetraps.

137
00:12:40,440 --> 00:12:42,160
Who's wasting good money?

138
00:12:42,200 --> 00:12:45,640
Here's where l get rid of
those no-good Bovanian francs.

139
00:12:45,680 --> 00:12:47,720
Ja! l go get it for you.

140
00:12:47,760 --> 00:12:49,200
Hurry up.

141
00:12:57,920 --> 00:13:00,480
(Hissing)

142
00:13:05,760 --> 00:13:08,120
See what it is.

143
00:13:53,960 --> 00:13:59,240
Should we go downstairs and get some fire
and put the water out... l mean...

144
00:13:59,280 --> 00:14:03,800
The fire is out. For once in your life
you've acted with impunity.

145
00:14:07,760 --> 00:14:10,720
- Now l've an idea.
- (Both) You've an idea?

146
00:14:10,760 --> 00:14:14,160
l'll buy your whole business for 5,000 gule.

147
00:14:14,200 --> 00:14:17,200
Why, you being so generous,
we'll throw in our mule.

148
00:14:17,240 --> 00:14:19,800
You can't do that, don't be such a fool.

149
00:14:19,840 --> 00:14:22,480
- That's my idea.
- lt's a splendid idea.

150
00:14:22,520 --> 00:14:24,720
lt's just an idea of my own.

151
00:14:24,760 --> 00:14:26,600
# lt's just an idea

152
00:14:26,640 --> 00:14:28,800
# A splendid idea

153
00:14:28,840 --> 00:14:31,960
# lt's a just an idea of my own

154
00:14:32,000 --> 00:14:34,000
# (Very deep voice) Won't you

155
00:14:34,040 --> 00:14:38,360
# Roll dem

156
00:14:39,480 --> 00:14:43,280
# Bones #

157
00:14:50,920 --> 00:14:53,240
- How about some dessert?
- Uh-uh.

158
00:14:53,280 --> 00:14:54,960
- Waiter.
- Yes, sir?

159
00:14:55,000 --> 00:14:58,480
Bring me a large slice of apple pie
and a demitasse.

160
00:14:58,520 --> 00:15:00,240
Yes, sir. And you, sir?

161
00:15:00,280 --> 00:15:03,280
- l'll have... What?
- What will you have, sir?

162
00:15:03,320 --> 00:15:05,920
- l'll try some of that demitasse.
- Yes, sir.

163
00:15:05,960 --> 00:15:09,000
- And bring me a cup of coffee, too.
- Yes, sir.

164
00:15:12,400 --> 00:15:15,400
l hope everything is of your satisfaction.

165
00:15:15,440 --> 00:15:18,280
- l'm too full for words.
- Splendid.

166
00:15:18,320 --> 00:15:22,960
Chi assaggia il nostro cibo, ritorna,
as they say in Swiss.

167
00:15:25,280 --> 00:15:27,880
Sorry, sir, there is no apple pie.

168
00:15:27,920 --> 00:15:29,920
- No apple pie?
- No, sir.

169
00:15:29,960 --> 00:15:32,200
Just what kind of a hotel is this?

170
00:15:32,240 --> 00:15:35,880
l am sorry. Maybe we have
some other kind you would like?

171
00:15:35,920 --> 00:15:39,680
No, sir. l have my mouth
all set for apple pie.

172
00:15:39,720 --> 00:15:42,320
- Send the chef to me at once.
- Yes, sir.

173
00:15:42,360 --> 00:15:46,480
- l will go to the bottom of this.
- See that you do.

174
00:15:46,520 --> 00:15:49,080
What is the meaning? Why no apple pie?

175
00:15:49,120 --> 00:15:51,280
Yes, what is the meaning?

176
00:15:51,320 --> 00:15:54,760
- What do you say?
- Don't stand there like a jackass!

177
00:15:54,800 --> 00:15:56,600
Why isn't there apple pie?

178
00:15:56,640 --> 00:15:59,840
Why don't you tell him?
He's got his face upset for it.

179
00:15:59,880 --> 00:16:01,480
Say something!

180
00:16:01,520 --> 00:16:03,400
Let me tell you something.

181
00:16:03,440 --> 00:16:08,000
l've had better chefs than you
discharged for not having apple pie.

182
00:16:08,040 --> 00:16:09,920
Absolutely.

183
00:16:09,960 --> 00:16:14,600
He shall be released
if he cannot tell why no apple pie.

184
00:16:14,640 --> 00:16:17,240
Make apple pie. Make lots of apple pie!

185
00:16:17,280 --> 00:16:19,880
Yes! Make a hundred apple pies.

186
00:16:19,920 --> 00:16:21,880
And make me an apple dumpling.

187
00:16:21,920 --> 00:16:23,720
You numbskull.

188
00:16:23,760 --> 00:16:25,920
Yeah, and that goes for him, too.

189
00:16:26,880 --> 00:16:29,640
l am sorry to cause you this inconvenient.

190
00:16:29,680 --> 00:16:32,840
l promise it never will happen again.

191
00:16:32,880 --> 00:16:35,680
Aw, just skip it. Bring me the bill.

192
00:16:35,720 --> 00:16:37,720
Waiter, the bill.

193
00:16:39,400 --> 00:16:43,560
Take it out of that and
bring me the change in American currency -

194
00:16:43,600 --> 00:16:45,520
large denominations.

195
00:16:50,600 --> 00:16:53,080
That is some funny joke.

196
00:16:53,120 --> 00:16:57,320
You Americans give always to me
a sense of humour.

197
00:17:02,040 --> 00:17:08,120
Now stop the monkey business and give me
some real money that l can pay the bill.

198
00:17:08,160 --> 00:17:11,920
What do you mean?
You've got 5,000 francs in that bill.

199
00:17:11,960 --> 00:17:14,160
They are no good in this country.

200
00:17:15,160 --> 00:17:18,720
- Well, where are they good?
- ln Bovania.

201
00:17:18,760 --> 00:17:21,080
Maybe we'd better go to Bovania.

202
00:17:21,120 --> 00:17:22,920
Where is Bovania?

203
00:17:22,960 --> 00:17:25,280
There is no such place.

204
00:17:27,640 --> 00:17:29,880
What are we going to do about it?

205
00:17:29,920 --> 00:17:33,760
What are you going to do?
You are going to pay the bill.

206
00:17:33,800 --> 00:17:36,320
That's all the money we've got.

207
00:17:36,360 --> 00:17:39,960
Questa é una truffa ben regolata!

208
00:17:40,000 --> 00:17:42,880
Don't drink that coffee!

209
00:17:42,920 --> 00:17:45,600
You come with me, come on. Come on.

210
00:17:45,640 --> 00:17:47,440
Come on.

211
00:17:49,320 --> 00:17:51,320
Put that down!

212
00:17:55,960 --> 00:17:57,960
What do you think has happened?

213
00:17:58,000 --> 00:18:02,200
After so much fuss about the apple pie
they cannot pay the bill

214
00:18:02,240 --> 00:18:04,120
so l put them to work.

215
00:18:04,160 --> 00:18:06,120
You will tell them what to do.

216
00:18:06,160 --> 00:18:08,520
And if they break any dishes -

217
00:18:08,560 --> 00:18:12,520
for every dish they break, work another day.

218
00:18:12,560 --> 00:18:14,760
Both of you! Go ahead.

219
00:18:19,960 --> 00:18:24,440
So, you bragged about
discharging better chefs than me?

220
00:18:24,480 --> 00:18:26,280
Didn't you?

221
00:18:27,320 --> 00:18:30,040
There are no better chefs than me.

222
00:18:30,080 --> 00:18:31,880
Are there?!

223
00:18:32,680 --> 00:18:34,680
Are there?

224
00:18:38,520 --> 00:18:40,840
You remember what the boss said.

225
00:18:40,880 --> 00:18:45,080
For every dish you break,
you'll work an extra day.

226
00:18:48,920 --> 00:18:50,720
Hold it.

227
00:18:58,080 --> 00:19:00,080
Catch!

228
00:19:03,600 --> 00:19:05,600
Come on.

229
00:19:15,280 --> 00:19:17,280
One day, two days.

230
00:19:18,240 --> 00:19:20,960
By the time you leave this place

231
00:19:21,000 --> 00:19:25,560
the grey hairs of your beards
will be trailing on this kitchen floor.

232
00:19:32,200 --> 00:19:34,800
(Chirping)

233
00:19:34,840 --> 00:19:37,400
Edward! Edward! Where in the name...

234
00:19:37,440 --> 00:19:39,120
Coming, sir.

235
00:19:39,160 --> 00:19:42,240
Edward, what's making
that noise in my head?

236
00:19:42,280 --> 00:19:44,120
l'm sure l don't know, sir.

237
00:19:44,160 --> 00:19:46,360
Can't you hear it? Listen.

238
00:19:48,000 --> 00:19:50,320
(Chirping)

239
00:19:55,560 --> 00:19:59,640
Bless your heart, sir.
That's not in your head, that's a cricket.

240
00:19:59,680 --> 00:20:01,880
- A cricket?
- Yes, sir.

241
00:20:03,000 --> 00:20:07,280
- The cricket song.
- That's not bad, sir. Not bad at all.

242
00:20:13,120 --> 00:20:15,120
# Hear the cricket

243
00:20:15,160 --> 00:20:19,800

- # Singing merrily... #

257
00:21:08,520 --> 00:21:11,920
How can l compose
with that infernal racket? Stop it!

(Engine splutters outside)

281
00:22:48,720 --> 00:22:52,040
l won't have it! l'll not be interrupted.

282
00:22:52,080 --> 00:22:54,520
Not even by me, Victor?

283
00:22:55,600 --> 00:22:58,000
Darling! Oh, my darling.

284
00:23:00,520 --> 00:23:02,400
What are you doing here?

285
00:23:02,440 --> 00:23:05,800
- Aren't you happy to see me?
- Why did you follow me?

286
00:23:05,840 --> 00:23:08,360
But, darling, l am your wife.

287
00:23:08,400 --> 00:23:10,280
Don't you remember?

288
00:23:10,320 --> 00:23:13,680
Edward, will you please
introduce me to my husband?

289
00:23:13,720 --> 00:23:14,920
Certainly.

290
00:23:14,960 --> 00:23:16,720
Edward!

291
00:23:16,760 --> 00:23:19,000
(Clears throat) l beg your pardon.

292
00:23:19,040 --> 00:23:22,520
Why is it you run away from me
and why the disguise?

293
00:23:22,560 --> 00:23:24,560
This is not a disguise.

294
00:23:24,600 --> 00:23:28,520
This costume is to get me into the mood
to write my greatest operetta.

295
00:23:28,560 --> 00:23:31,760
- ln those fancy pants?!
- These are not fancy pants,

296
00:23:31,800 --> 00:23:35,680
- they're Tyrolean trousers.
- Darling, l don't understand.

297
00:23:35,720 --> 00:23:40,480
You write your greatest music with me
and the critics have all acclaimed you.

298
00:23:40,520 --> 00:23:43,560
The critics have acclaimed me?!
That's good.

299
00:23:43,600 --> 00:23:48,880
Just listen to what the Vienna Journal says.
Read this. Never mind, l'll read it.

300
00:23:48,920 --> 00:23:52,960
''Anna Hoefel's singing is divine.''
ls my music mentioned? No.

301
00:23:53,000 --> 00:23:58,720
''Anna Hoefel's new operetta is a sensation.
PS - the composer is Victor Albert.''

302
00:23:58,760 --> 00:24:00,560
Well, we're a success.

303
00:24:00,600 --> 00:24:04,520
We're a success?
You're a success. l'm a ''PS''.

304
00:24:04,560 --> 00:24:10,600
But that's all over now. This is one time the
critics won't be blinded by your lovely voice.

305
00:24:10,640 --> 00:24:14,360
You're-You're going home
a-and you're going to stay there.

306
00:24:14,400 --> 00:24:16,400
My home is with you.

307
00:24:17,960 --> 00:24:22,880
With you beside me l could never compose
music about an unsophisticated girl

308
00:24:22,920 --> 00:24:25,360
that a peasant could fall in love with.

309
00:24:25,400 --> 00:24:28,440
And a peasant could not
fall in love with me?

310
00:24:28,480 --> 00:24:30,600
A peasant fall in love with you?

311
00:24:31,880 --> 00:24:36,720
lmagine a peasant falling in love with
a prima donna! He'd be scared to death.

312
00:24:36,760 --> 00:24:39,160
ls that so? l suppose you think l...

313
00:24:39,200 --> 00:24:42,200
Now, now, now, darling, please. Please.

314
00:24:43,160 --> 00:24:47,520
You go back to Vienna and
leave me in this peaceful atmosphere

315
00:24:47,560 --> 00:24:50,840
where l can compose undisturbed, huh?

316
00:24:50,880 --> 00:24:54,360
All right. l'll go back to Vienna.

317
00:24:55,400 --> 00:24:58,000
You go ahead with your foolishness

318
00:24:58,040 --> 00:25:01,080
but at the last moment
don't come crying to me

319
00:25:01,120 --> 00:25:03,920
to sing your...your masterpiece!

320
00:25:09,800 --> 00:25:11,280
Peaceful!

321
00:25:21,040 --> 00:25:23,040
Permit me, madam.

322
00:25:24,000 --> 00:25:26,000
- There you are.
- Thank you.

323
00:25:26,040 --> 00:25:28,480
- The pleasure's all mine.
- And mine.

324
00:25:28,520 --> 00:25:32,520
- At least the help is courteous.
- Well, we can't help being help.

325
00:25:32,560 --> 00:25:36,000
We're American gentlemen
temporarily embarrassed.

326
00:25:36,040 --> 00:25:39,280
- We wash dishes.
- Gentlemen who wash dishes?

327
00:25:39,320 --> 00:25:42,520
lt's purely temporary. lt happened like this.

328
00:25:46,040 --> 00:25:48,040
Pardon the whispering.

329
00:25:49,480 --> 00:25:52,400
..when the check came,
we didn't have any money.

330
00:25:52,440 --> 00:25:54,880
- What?
- l told her we had to stay here

331
00:25:54,920 --> 00:25:57,000
till we get some money to get out.

332
00:25:57,040 --> 00:26:00,320
- What for?
- Well... None of your business!

333
00:26:00,360 --> 00:26:05,800
Do you mean you have to stay in this hotel
because you couldn't pay for your dinner?

334
00:26:05,840 --> 00:26:08,840
Absolutely.

335
00:26:08,880 --> 00:26:12,840
l'll take a double order
of everything on the menu.

336
00:26:14,480 --> 00:26:16,760
Everything is going to be lovely.

337
00:26:17,960 --> 00:26:20,120
Everything is going to be fine.

338
00:26:37,960 --> 00:26:39,960
- Take it.
- Yes, sir.

339
00:26:55,360 --> 00:26:57,160
Take it.

340
00:27:08,480 --> 00:27:10,160
Take it.

341
00:27:41,240 --> 00:27:43,240
Here! Put them all back.

342
00:27:43,280 --> 00:27:46,080
And keep marking till l tell you to stop.

343
00:27:46,120 --> 00:27:48,120
Come on now.

344
00:27:54,160 --> 00:27:55,720
Go on.

345
00:27:57,760 --> 00:27:59,840
(Music and laughter)

346
00:28:20,520 --> 00:28:23,160
How often o they fill those barrels?

347
00:28:23,200 --> 00:28:25,640
Every time they become empty.

348
00:28:30,680 --> 00:28:33,120
- What's on your mind?
- Huh?

349
00:28:33,160 --> 00:28:35,480
What's on your mind?

350
00:28:36,960 --> 00:28:38,720
Nothing.

351
00:28:40,160 --> 00:28:43,840
That brandy is put there
for a humane purpose

352
00:28:43,880 --> 00:28:47,080
and anyone that would
stoop so low as to touch it

353
00:28:47,120 --> 00:28:49,320
without a just cause

354
00:28:49,360 --> 00:28:51,360
should be shot.

355
00:28:53,760 --> 00:28:55,760
He certainly should.

356
00:28:58,520 --> 00:29:01,600
Do they save people
in the summertime, too?

357
00:29:01,640 --> 00:29:05,240
No. Only when it snows.

358
00:29:05,280 --> 00:29:07,080
Huh.

359
00:29:12,760 --> 00:29:16,600
Hey, fatty, come with me.
l got some work for you inside.

360
00:29:20,120 --> 00:29:22,840
What does that guy think l am?

361
00:29:22,880 --> 00:29:25,720
- Calling me fatty.
- Why don't you tell him?

362
00:29:25,760 --> 00:29:29,240
For two pins l'd go in
and punch that monkey on the nose.

363
00:29:29,280 --> 00:29:31,800
- l certainly would.
- l'll be right in.

364
00:29:31,840 --> 00:29:33,840
And ano...

365
00:30:36,440 --> 00:30:38,480
(Growls)

366
00:32:11,280 --> 00:32:13,440
Oh! Ooh!

367
00:32:13,480 --> 00:32:15,600
Help. Help!

368
00:32:17,600 --> 00:32:19,840
l'm exhausted. Oh!

369
00:32:19,880 --> 00:32:21,880
Help! Help!

370
00:32:22,720 --> 00:32:25,160
Help. Oh!

371
00:32:25,200 --> 00:32:28,840
Oh, help! l'm exhausted. l...

372
00:33:12,960 --> 00:33:14,840
Help! Help!

373
00:33:14,880 --> 00:33:17,080
l'm freezing to death.

374
00:33:17,120 --> 00:33:19,120
Help. Help.

375
00:33:20,080 --> 00:33:22,120
Help. Help.

376
00:33:23,080 --> 00:33:25,320
Help. Help.

377
00:33:26,040 --> 00:33:28,080
Help. Help.

378
00:33:29,000 --> 00:33:30,600
Help.

379
00:33:31,360 --> 00:33:33,000
Help.

380
00:33:36,440 --> 00:33:38,080
Help.

381
00:33:38,960 --> 00:33:40,560
Help.

382
00:33:41,320 --> 00:33:42,880
Help.

383
00:33:48,800 --> 00:33:50,200
Help.

384
00:33:51,160 --> 00:33:53,960
(Piano playing, Victor humming)

385
00:34:13,400 --> 00:34:19,720
# l only know you're mine to love

386
00:34:21,080 --> 00:34:27,740
# You...
# You give a new design to love

387
00:34:29,160 --> 00:34:32,960
# Be still my heart, be still

388
00:34:33,000 --> 00:34:36,640
# We haven't lived until

389
00:34:36,680 --> 00:34:41,600
# This moment with its thrill of lo... #

390
00:34:47,000 --> 00:34:50,440
Take off that silly costume
and get out of this hotel.

391
00:34:50,480 --> 00:34:52,600
l'm afraid that's impossible.

392
00:34:52,640 --> 00:34:55,360
- And this costume isn't silly.
- lt is.

393
00:34:55,400 --> 00:34:57,080
- lt isn't!
- lt is!

394
00:34:57,120 --> 00:35:00,880
Then why do you demand
that the hotel staff dress this way?

395
00:35:00,920 --> 00:35:04,240
- That has nothing to do with you.
- Oh, yes it has.

396
00:35:04,280 --> 00:35:06,880
The manager insisted that l wear this.

397
00:35:06,920 --> 00:35:08,640
What are you talking about?

398
00:35:08,680 --> 00:35:11,800
Don't you think l make
a pretty chambermaid?

399
00:35:11,840 --> 00:35:15,800
No, l don't. That costume
isn't fooling anybody.

400
00:35:16,840 --> 00:35:20,240
l am sorry, sir,
but l haven't the time to argue.

401
00:35:24,360 --> 00:35:29,040
- l must finish my duties.
- l'll not have you interfering with my work!

402
00:35:29,080 --> 00:35:30,960
- Edward!
- Coming, sir.

403
00:35:31,000 --> 00:35:33,040
l was just observing, sir...

404
00:35:34,320 --> 00:35:36,920
Why, Miss Hoefel, how charming.

405
00:35:37,960 --> 00:35:40,320
You look perfect for our new operetta.

406
00:35:40,360 --> 00:35:44,000
Oh, you idiot!
Can't you see this is one of her tricks?

407
00:35:44,040 --> 00:35:49,360
This hotel isn't big enough for the two of us.
Order the manager to get rid of her.

408
00:35:49,400 --> 00:35:51,760
- Well...
- What are you waiting for?

409
00:35:51,800 --> 00:35:54,800
What a tasty morsel
for the Vienna newspapers.

410
00:35:54,840 --> 00:36:00,680
l can see the headlines! ''Famous composer
has wife thrown out of hotel.''

411
00:36:00,720 --> 00:36:04,720
- You wouldn't dare.
- You leave me no alternative.

412
00:36:04,760 --> 00:36:07,120
l am at your mercy.

413
00:36:07,160 --> 00:36:09,920
Oh! This is all your fault.

414
00:36:09,960 --> 00:36:13,320
Get me a place where l can work in peace
away from everybody.

415
00:36:13,360 --> 00:36:14,840
You, too!

416
00:36:14,880 --> 00:36:16,840
Me, too? l...l...

417
00:36:16,880 --> 00:36:18,880
Well? Well? Well?

418
00:36:21,440 --> 00:36:24,280
Why don't you give up this crazy idea

419
00:36:24,320 --> 00:36:27,800
and stop acting like a musician?

420
00:36:27,840 --> 00:36:30,080
Oh, l'm crazy, am l?

421
00:36:30,120 --> 00:36:34,520
Just because l want to fulfil an ambition
that does not include you.

422
00:36:34,560 --> 00:36:37,280
Victor, you are getting one of your spells.

423
00:36:37,320 --> 00:36:40,840
You'll be foaming at the mouth soon
and biting people.

424
00:36:40,880 --> 00:36:43,160
And you're the first one l'll bite.

425
00:36:43,200 --> 00:36:46,280
lf you do, l'll bite you right back.

426
00:36:46,320 --> 00:36:47,760
- Yes!
- Ah!

427
00:36:48,800 --> 00:36:52,360
l've just seen the manager
and it's all arranged...

428
00:36:54,960 --> 00:36:56,560
What's arranged?

429
00:36:56,600 --> 00:37:00,040
A quiet place where you can work
and nobody can disturb you.

430
00:37:00,080 --> 00:37:01,880
- Out there.
- Where?

431
00:37:01,920 --> 00:37:04,120
Out there, sir.

432
00:37:08,120 --> 00:37:11,520
The tree house! Perfect.
Have my piano sent up there.

433
00:37:11,560 --> 00:37:15,280
lt's being taken care of right now, sir.
The men'll be right up.

434
00:37:15,960 --> 00:37:17,760
Stan.

435
00:37:20,880 --> 00:37:22,680
Stan.

436
00:37:30,480 --> 00:37:32,240
(Hiccups)

437
00:38:05,480 --> 00:38:07,800
(Hiccups) Ollie...

438
00:38:07,840 --> 00:38:10,280
- What?
- l ought to be shot.

439
00:38:23,600 --> 00:38:26,880
- What is it you wish?
- We've come to move the piano.

440
00:38:26,920 --> 00:38:28,920
Oh, yes.

441
00:38:44,200 --> 00:38:46,880
- l believe this is yours.
- Oh, thank you.

442
00:38:46,920 --> 00:38:49,600
- You're welcome, your ladyship.
- A chambermaid!

443
00:38:49,640 --> 00:38:53,040
(Laughing) ''l believe this is yours.''

444
00:38:53,080 --> 00:38:55,520
''You're welcome, your ladyship.''

445
00:39:08,840 --> 00:39:10,840
(Ollie, clapping loudly) Psst!

446
00:39:18,400 --> 00:39:20,200
(Hiccups)

447
00:39:44,960 --> 00:39:47,240
Come over here and help me push it.

448
00:39:52,640 --> 00:39:54,640
Are you afraid of me?

449
00:39:55,520 --> 00:39:57,520
- Why, no, ma'am.
- No?

450
00:39:57,560 --> 00:39:59,600
- No.
- Do you like me?

451
00:39:59,640 --> 00:40:01,960
Well...yes, ma'am.

452
00:40:02,000 --> 00:40:04,280
You do? And you, you too?

453
00:40:05,720 --> 00:40:07,520
No, no, no, no.

454
00:40:07,560 --> 00:40:09,560
l mean you.

455
00:40:29,120 --> 00:40:31,120
Close the door.

456
00:41:05,800 --> 00:41:07,880
(Screaming and yelling)

457
00:41:47,400 --> 00:41:49,400
(Whistles)

458
00:42:24,760 --> 00:42:26,760
See what that is.

459
00:43:02,000 --> 00:43:04,080
Wait a minute!

460
00:43:07,520 --> 00:43:09,520
Come here.

461
00:43:57,680 --> 00:44:00,120
- See if it's safe.
- Huh?

462
00:44:00,160 --> 00:44:02,600
See if it's strong enough to hold us.

463
00:44:04,040 --> 00:44:06,480
Well, if it's not, l'll let you know.

464
00:44:23,000 --> 00:44:27,960
- Say, l'm not gonna go across that bridge.
- You just went across it.

465
00:44:28,000 --> 00:44:30,160
- Did l?
- Why, certainly.

466
00:44:43,800 --> 00:44:46,600
Come on, let's get this piano across here.

467
00:44:48,800 --> 00:44:50,640
Get a hold.

468
00:44:51,600 --> 00:44:53,600
Take it easy.

469
00:45:12,480 --> 00:45:14,960
We'll have to lift it. Come on.

470
00:45:24,720 --> 00:45:27,000
Come and get me!

471
00:45:27,040 --> 00:45:29,240
(Yelling)

472
00:45:29,280 --> 00:45:33,160
Come and get me!
l can't hold on much longer.

473
00:45:33,200 --> 00:45:35,120
Oh! Ooh!

474
00:45:35,160 --> 00:45:38,200
Hey! Come on and get me out of here.

475
00:45:39,320 --> 00:45:41,320
Hey! Hurry!

476
00:45:41,360 --> 00:45:43,760
(Ollie panicking)

477
00:45:43,800 --> 00:45:45,880
Take it easy, take it easy now.

478
00:45:58,200 --> 00:46:00,200
What happened?

479
00:46:02,160 --> 00:46:06,880
Look out. l'm gonna see
if the rest of these slats are safe.

480
00:46:36,960 --> 00:46:40,960
Everything's OK.
From now on it's gonna be easy sailing.

481
00:47:20,760 --> 00:47:22,600
l see a monkey.

482
00:47:22,640 --> 00:47:25,440
- A what?
- A monkey.

483
00:47:26,480 --> 00:47:28,800
Well, it doesn't surprise me a bit.

484
00:47:28,840 --> 00:47:33,840
lf you don't quit drinking that brandy,
you'll be seeing pink elephants.

485
00:48:03,440 --> 00:48:05,760
Everything ain't just all right.

486
00:48:11,840 --> 00:48:13,760
Oh!

487
00:48:23,440 --> 00:48:26,080
(Ollie) Quit that! What are you...

488
00:48:47,760 --> 00:48:50,040
Get your foot off of my hand.

489
00:49:22,400 --> 00:49:24,560
Ooh!

490
00:49:45,040 --> 00:49:47,040
- Here you are.
- Thank you.

491
00:49:52,200 --> 00:49:54,440
- Oh, please.
- Yes?

492
00:49:54,480 --> 00:49:57,440
- Will you tell me something?
- Yes.

493
00:49:57,480 --> 00:50:01,040
- Are you afraid of me?
- Afraid of you? No. Why?

494
00:50:01,840 --> 00:50:03,680
Do you like me?

495
00:50:03,720 --> 00:50:05,720
Like you? l love you.

496
00:50:05,760 --> 00:50:09,920
Ever since l see you in this hotel,
my heart goes bumpety-bump.

497
00:50:09,960 --> 00:50:12,360
Oh, er...you are so sweet.

498
00:50:27,120 --> 00:50:32,520
Now that you've arranged everything and
the piano is ruined, how am l going to work?

499
00:50:32,560 --> 00:50:36,480
l have everything under control.
There'll be a piano here in a week.

500
00:50:36,520 --> 00:50:38,440
A week?!

501
00:50:38,480 --> 00:50:42,280
ln meantime, sir,
why not use the organ in the lobby?

502
00:51:14,480 --> 00:51:16,480
Excuse me.

503
00:51:25,120 --> 00:51:26,560
Oh!

504
00:51:26,600 --> 00:51:29,160
- Why, you dropped these.
- Thank you.

505
00:51:29,200 --> 00:51:31,600
- You're welcome.
- You're so sweet.

506
00:51:31,640 --> 00:51:35,560
And l never thanked you for
helping me getting into this hotel.

507
00:51:35,600 --> 00:51:40,080
lt was a mere nothing
combined with a terrific pleasure.

508
00:51:40,120 --> 00:51:43,360
- Will you tell me something?
- Certainly.

509
00:51:43,400 --> 00:51:48,560
lf you didn't know me, wouldn't you think
that l was really a peasant girl?

510
00:51:48,600 --> 00:51:53,640
l'd say l would.
The prettiest peasant girl l have ever seen.

511
00:51:54,800 --> 00:51:57,200
Oh, you are sweet.

512
00:52:24,000 --> 00:52:25,880
(Sighs)

513
00:52:25,920 --> 00:52:27,800
What's the matter?

514
00:52:27,840 --> 00:52:29,840
l don't know.

515
00:52:29,880 --> 00:52:32,240
l know.

516
00:52:32,280 --> 00:52:34,960
- What?
- You're in love.

517
00:52:36,240 --> 00:52:38,480
- ln what?
- ln love.

518
00:52:38,520 --> 00:52:41,080
L-U-G-H, love.

519
00:52:42,120 --> 00:52:44,640
- Am l?
- You certainly are.

520
00:52:45,960 --> 00:52:48,520
- How can you tell?
- lt's easy.

521
00:52:48,560 --> 00:52:52,280
Look at the silly, sloppy look on your face.
Look at it.

522
00:52:54,200 --> 00:52:56,200
ls that what it is?

523
00:52:56,240 --> 00:52:59,560
- Do you mind if l tell you something else?
- What?

524
00:52:59,600 --> 00:53:01,800
She's in love with you, too.

525
00:53:03,640 --> 00:53:07,040
- How do you know?
- Any dumbbell can tell that.

526
00:53:07,080 --> 00:53:09,080
You know what you ought to do?

527
00:53:09,120 --> 00:53:14,080
lf you play your cards right,
you've got her right in the palm of your hand.

528
00:53:16,040 --> 00:53:18,080
Tell me some more, Stanley.

529
00:53:18,120 --> 00:53:21,840
There's nothing to tell.
All you've got to do is let her know.

530
00:53:21,880 --> 00:53:24,160
But you don't understand.

531
00:53:24,200 --> 00:53:28,720
This is my first love affair
and l don't know how.

532
00:53:28,760 --> 00:53:33,280
Why don't you do like the Gay Caviars
used to do in the olden days?

533
00:53:33,320 --> 00:53:36,120
- The what?
- The Caviars.

534
00:53:36,160 --> 00:53:38,360
Gay Caviars! What did they do?

535
00:53:38,400 --> 00:53:42,400
When they were in love
they used to go by the light of the moon

536
00:53:42,440 --> 00:53:45,440
and they used to serenade their lady fair.

537
00:53:46,960 --> 00:53:50,120
But suppose
she's in love with someone else?

538
00:53:50,160 --> 00:53:53,240
Faint heart ne'er won fair lady.

539
00:53:55,720 --> 00:53:57,720
You're right.

540

Hello! What are you doing here?

563
00:55:58,760 --> 00:56:02,480
- l've brought you some dandelions.
- Oh! Thank you.

And he's got something
to tell you, too. Haven't you?

Oh, your poetry is so very touching.

570

- Thank you.

- Yes?

..a chance to take you
to the Alpenfest tomorrow?

574
00:56:30,800 --> 00:56:34,120
- The Alpenfest?
- lt's going to be a big holiday.

575
00:56:34,160 --> 00:56:37,640
Yeah. All the countryside
gathers for merrymaking.

576
00:56:37,680 --> 00:56:41,720
There'll be gypsy fortune-telling,
dancing and song.

577
00:56:42,760 --> 00:56:45,400
l have an idea. Will you help me?

578
00:56:45,440 --> 00:56:48,960
Yes. l'd do anything in the world for you.

579

Then meet here tomorrow morning

- What?

We forgot to serenade her.

585

Hey, you dumbbells.
What are you playing music at this hour for?

598
00:58:16,440 --> 00:58:19,400
- We're serenading.
- Serenading who?

599
00:58:19,440 --> 00:58:22,640
His sweetheart.
You know, Anna, the new chambermaid.

600
00:58:22,680 --> 00:58:25,080
- For what?
- He's in love with her.

She's in love with him, too, isn't she?

Let me tell you something.

Anna is in love with me. She's my girl.

and l will let nobody to come in between.

What's the meaning of this intrusion?
Can't my wife and l have some privacy?

Your wife?
