In the Caspian Sea, a boat 
is shipwrecked during a storm.

7
00:02:26,602 --> 00:02:30,223
During two days, the current 
drives them southward.

8
00:02:54,099 --> 00:02:57,935
Two days and two nights, the 
current carries them southward.

9
00:04:09,157 --> 00:04:14,057
In the south of the Caspian Sea,
in Soviet Azerbaijan...

10
00:04:41,528 --> 00:04:43,637
...there's an island.

11
00:06:32,692 --> 00:06:34,997
What a nice island!

12
00:06:35,208 --> 00:06:36,751
Nice? Really think so?

13
00:06:36,948 --> 00:06:39,279
Don't you agree?

14
00:06:44,522 --> 00:06:46,732
Alyosha, look.

15
00:06:54,401 --> 00:06:56,338
But, what are they doing?

16
00:06:57,709 --> 00:07:00,409
How should I know?

17
00:07:00,966 --> 00:07:04,717
An interesting posture!

18
00:07:05,720 --> 00:07:07,945
They're women!

19
00:07:08,045 --> 00:07:11,072
- Women?
- Of course, women.

20
00:07:54,315 --> 00:07:58,163
You can't even shoot a dead duck...

21
00:07:58,285 --> 00:08:03,165
and when you go out hunting,
people have to duck.

22
00:08:58,824 --> 00:09:03,204
"Soar higher, seagull...

23
00:09:03,505 --> 00:09:07,517
"...night is falling over
the blue sea...

24
00:09:08,809 --> 00:09:12,861
"Hasten your flight and find out...

25
00:09:15,030 --> 00:09:19,213
"... how my loved one fares.

26
00:09:19,646 --> 00:09:24,499
"Tell him how much I miss him...

27
00:09:26,619 --> 00:09:30,654
"... and that my love will never cease."

28
00:09:36,010 --> 00:09:40,672
Alyosha, we risked death...

29
00:09:40,772 --> 00:09:45,504
at least 11 times in the storm...

30
00:09:45,604 --> 00:09:48,827
and I was never afraid.

31
00:09:48,928 --> 00:09:54,039
But saying "I love you" to a woman...

32
00:09:54,040 --> 00:09:56,021
scares me.

33
00:09:57,608 --> 00:09:59,390
How about you?

34
00:10:50,875 --> 00:10:53,411
Anybody here?

35
00:11:54,412 --> 00:11:55,971
- Hello.
- Hello.

36
00:12:03,165 --> 00:12:05,916
Who are you looking for, comrade?

37
00:12:06,865 --> 00:12:10,367
I was looking for someone from
the kolkhoz directorate.

38
00:12:10,402 --> 00:12:13,870
- I didn't find anyone!
- Well, here I am.

39
00:12:24,723 --> 00:12:27,615
- And this?
- My orders.

40
00:12:28,015 --> 00:12:30,600
- What orders?
- Mine. Read it!

41
00:12:38,044 --> 00:12:39,419
There's nothing left!

42
00:12:39,454 --> 00:12:41,310
In summary, what is it
you want, comrade?

43
00:12:41,510 --> 00:12:44,697
Didn't you write asking for a mechanic?

44
00:12:44,698 --> 00:12:46,891
- Yes-
- Well, here I am.

45
00:12:47,091 --> 00:12:49,977
- Mechanic?
- Mechanic.

46
00:12:49,978 --> 00:12:51,541
- Really?
- Yes.

47
00:12:51,542 --> 00:12:53,823
- That's fantastic!
- Why are you so glad?

48
00:12:53,824 --> 00:12:56,271
We were afraid that we couldn't
go out to sea tomorrow.

49
00:12:56,272 --> 00:12:59,667
- Where are all the men?
- Serving.

50
00:13:01,211 --> 00:13:04,099
In the far East...

51
00:13:04,100 --> 00:13:06,588
in the Pacific fleet!

52
00:13:06,589 --> 00:13:09,539
I'll stay for the duration
of the fishing season.

53
00:13:16,548 --> 00:13:19,710
- Who are they?
- Members of my brigade.

54
00:13:23,240 --> 00:13:26,394
- They're afraid of me.
- I don't think so...

55
00:13:30,122 --> 00:13:33,711
Akim, the mechanic's here!

56
00:13:35,215 --> 00:13:38,101
- Are you really a mechanic?
- Yes.

57
00:13:38,136 --> 00:13:40,134
At last!

58
00:13:47,369 --> 00:13:49,775
He's the kolkhoz president.

59
00:13:49,875 --> 00:13:51,740
Welcome.

60
00:14:03,583 --> 00:14:06,622
Masha, take him to
see the motor boat.

61
00:14:06,623 --> 00:14:08,570
Let's go.

62
00:14:20,891 --> 00:14:22,794
Here you are.

63
00:14:29,685 --> 00:14:31,497
- Nice!
- Nice?

64
00:14:31,498 --> 00:14:33,821
Very nice!

65
00:14:33,822 --> 00:14:37,609
- Right, very nice?
- Gorgeous!

66
00:14:37,610 --> 00:14:40,526
Well, have a good look
if you like it so much.

67
00:14:40,726 --> 00:14:42,746
And what's there to look?

68
00:14:42,747 --> 00:14:47,067
I can handle everything!
Motorcycles, cars...

69
00:14:47,068 --> 00:14:49,491
- Planes too?
- Yes.

70
00:14:50,824 --> 00:14:52,394
Liar!

71
00:14:56,981 --> 00:14:59,384
And this?

72
00:15:01,968 --> 00:15:04,337
My favorite necklace!

73
00:15:04,338 --> 00:15:06,271
Go get it!

74
00:15:06,272 --> 00:15:08,292
Jump in!

75
00:15:09,207 --> 00:15:11,968
Go get it!

76
00:15:13,035 --> 00:15:15,382
You little...!

77
00:15:16,936 --> 00:15:21,793
He'll find it, you'll see.
He's a very good swimmer.

78
00:15:21,794 --> 00:15:23,962
Don't worry.

79
00:15:25,235 --> 00:15:30,107
Meanwhile, come with me to the office.

80
00:15:31,721 --> 00:15:33,794
I have the orders.

81
00:15:36,326 --> 00:15:38,423
Here they are!

82
00:15:42,172 --> 00:15:43,593
This one's also empty!

83
00:15:43,594 --> 00:15:45,678
- What?
- It's also empty.

84
00:15:45,978 --> 00:15:50,541
No, the page number and the stamps
are here. The letters disappeared!

85
00:15:52,275 --> 00:15:57,238
Why don't you come with me meanwhile?

86
00:15:58,564 --> 00:16:02,965
He'll find it.
Don't worry.

87
00:16:03,378 --> 00:16:06,624
Alyosha... Hurry up!
Understand?

88
00:16:08,786 --> 00:16:12,822
Thus their life began at the
"Lights of Communism" kolkhoz.

89
00:16:25,723 --> 00:16:32,452
Losing your appetite over a
girl you only saw once!

90
00:16:35,301 --> 00:16:36,866
That's never happened to me!

91
00:16:36,867 --> 00:16:39,834
Don't talk rubbish!

92
00:16:41,355 --> 00:16:44,567
You're also crazy over her!

93
00:16:58,548 --> 00:17:00,558
You like her too!

94
00:17:00,559 --> 00:17:06,321
You're wrong.
I haven't lost my appetite.

95
00:17:06,322 --> 00:17:10,330
You're the one who's smitten!

96
00:17:10,831 --> 00:17:12,910
It's so obvious!

97
00:17:58,664 --> 00:18:01,717
Listen, let's finish this up.

98
00:18:03,436 --> 00:18:06,476
Wait here a second.

99
00:18:07,652 --> 00:18:10,780
I'll be right back.
Bon appétit.

100
00:19:53,096 --> 00:19:55,175
Every morning, with the blinding sun...

101
00:19:55,237 --> 00:19:57,741
... with the tempest and the squall...

102
00:19:57,742 --> 00:19:59,902
...when the cold north wind blows,
or with the burning hot one...

103
00:19:59,903 --> 00:20:02,055
...that comes from India...

104
00:20:02,056 --> 00:20:04,477
...our friends set out to sea...

105
00:20:04,478 --> 00:20:07,724
...with the fishermen from the island.

106
00:20:26,054 --> 00:20:27,803
And one day...

107
00:20:55,676 --> 00:20:59,292
"Through the bad weather in the fall...

108
00:21:01,210 --> 00:21:04,913
"I roam through your places.

109
00:21:04,914 --> 00:21:10,420
"But why do I dream about you, Nastya...

110
00:21:10,682 --> 00:21:15,028
"...in blue-laced ribbons?

111
00:21:15,029 --> 00:21:19,584
"But why do I dream about you, Nastya...

112
00:21:20,980 --> 00:21:25,084
"...in blue-laced ribbons?

113
00:21:39,945 --> 00:21:41,554
Alyosha didn't come on board.

114
00:21:41,555 --> 00:21:44,197
- What do you mean?
- He's not...

115
00:21:44,498 --> 00:21:47,497
I'll go look for him...

116
00:22:22,102 --> 00:22:27,126
Says he's feeling ill.
Doesn't want to go out to sea.

117
00:22:27,227 --> 00:22:31,558
No way is he feeling ill!
He's as healthy as an oak!

118
00:22:35,959 --> 00:22:37,827
What's wrong with you?

119
00:22:39,589 --> 00:22:42,716
The motor boat can't leave without you.

120
00:22:42,751 --> 00:22:45,097
What's the matter?
Are you crying?

121
00:22:47,383 --> 00:22:51,823
You can't start crying just now...
With all this heat!

122
00:23:08,374 --> 00:23:10,825
What's the matter?

123
00:23:13,668 --> 00:23:15,916
Does it hurt?

124
00:23:19,911 --> 00:23:22,383
Should I call a doctor?

125
00:23:23,703 --> 00:23:25,722
Should I?

126
00:23:32,188 --> 00:23:35,605
It's very hot today...

127
00:23:36,622 --> 00:23:40,081
...it won't be fun.

128
00:23:43,670 --> 00:23:50,613
The fishermen will have to go
out with the oar boat...

129
00:24:12,497 --> 00:24:17,479
Alyosha! The motor boat can't
leave without you!

130
00:24:18,473 --> 00:24:21,057
Come on! Push!

131
00:24:25,410 --> 00:24:27,482
All together!

132
00:24:35,145 --> 00:24:37,848
Come on! Push!

133
00:25:42,809 --> 00:25:47,149
At night, when the fishermen
return from the sea...

134
00:26:12,375 --> 00:26:16,247
...Alyosha returns to the city.

135
00:29:32,482 --> 00:29:34,326
Excuse me.

136
00:29:46,876 --> 00:29:49,517
We have to talk.

137
00:30:31,832 --> 00:30:33,672
If I were to talk...

138
00:30:34,836 --> 00:30:39,483
...to an iceberg about
the great suffering...

139
00:30:39,484 --> 00:30:43,364
...in my heart...

140
00:30:43,365 --> 00:30:47,374
...even the iceberg would melt.

141
00:30:49,805 --> 00:30:52,637
Why are you staring like that?

142
00:30:56,592 --> 00:30:59,558
Don't stare at me that way.

143
00:31:05,053 --> 00:31:08,197
Tell him not to look at me that way.

144
00:31:12,440 --> 00:31:19,173
I want to talk to you about my friend...

145
00:31:19,474 --> 00:31:24,121
...my best friend and comrade.

146
00:31:25,651 --> 00:31:28,037
There he is!

147
00:31:30,388 --> 00:31:32,650
A liar and a slacker.

148
00:31:32,651 --> 00:31:34,958
Take a good look at him!

149
00:31:36,289 --> 00:31:42,835
Alyosha, I begged you to come with me!

150
00:31:44,252 --> 00:31:45,915
Instead, he...!

151
00:31:47,016 --> 00:31:49,205
Was crying!

152
00:31:49,206 --> 00:31:53,024
"Should I call a doctor?"
He: "No, it's useless."

153
00:31:53,025 --> 00:31:56,090
We all...

154
00:31:56,091 --> 00:31:58,834
...told him...

155
00:31:58,835 --> 00:32:03,348
"Come, Alyosha, come!"

156
00:32:06,306 --> 00:32:07,908
"Come!"

157
00:32:07,909 --> 00:32:10,288
He didn't budge.

158
00:32:10,289 --> 00:32:14,391
But then he went out.
And where did he go?!

159
00:32:14,392 --> 00:32:18,502
To the city, to buy...

160
00:32:19,327 --> 00:32:21,093
...a necklace.

161
00:32:21,094 --> 00:32:24,744
Stupidity!

162
00:32:26,409 --> 00:32:32,468
You're the only mechanic here!

163
00:32:32,569 --> 00:32:35,573
Do you understand that?

164
00:32:37,862 --> 00:32:40,711
No, you don't.

165
00:32:42,042 --> 00:32:45,765
We couldn't set out on the motor boat.

166
00:32:45,766 --> 00:32:48,901
And how many fish did we catch?

167
00:32:52,935 --> 00:32:56,920
Five times less than usual.

168
00:32:58,830 --> 00:33:03,792
How could you betray the kolkhoz?

169
00:33:05,465 --> 00:33:07,336
And me!

170
00:33:26,843 --> 00:33:29,707
Let me speak now.

171
00:36:38,079 --> 00:36:43,953
You know something? I think
you should marry Mashenka.

172
00:36:43,954 --> 00:36:47,397
- Me?
- Yes, you.

173
00:36:47,398 --> 00:36:49,518
Me?

174
00:37:00,743 --> 00:37:02,892
Alyosha... Tell me...

175
00:37:03,593 --> 00:37:06,336
Are you serious?

176
00:37:14,123 --> 00:37:16,239
I'm marrying her!

177
00:37:21,966 --> 00:37:23,936
I'm marrying her!

178
00:37:29,618 --> 00:37:34,595
It'll be a wonderful life for me!

179
00:37:36,470 --> 00:37:40,943
You know... Me and Masha...

180
00:37:41,144 --> 00:37:44,206
...will be like two bodies and one soul.

181
00:37:44,307 --> 00:37:47,717
We will sail the sea together.

182
00:37:51,756 --> 00:37:54,605
We'll have children...

183
00:37:55,406 --> 00:37:58,444
...so many children...

184
00:37:59,016 --> 00:38:04,373
... one, two, three, four, five.

185
00:38:07,482 --> 00:38:10,898
Do you know how I'll
celebrate my wedding?

186
00:38:11,563 --> 00:38:15,161
Imagine. The sea, the seagulls...

187
00:38:15,162 --> 00:38:18,847
...ten boats, one after the other...

188
00:38:18,848 --> 00:38:24,373
...in each one, 22 musicians.

189
00:38:24,974 --> 00:38:28,861
And you'll conduct the orchestra.

190
00:38:32,496 --> 00:38:35,373
And this is what you'll play...

191
00:38:58,242 --> 00:39:00,253
What a beautiful song!

192
00:39:00,418 --> 00:39:05,067
Even the fish will stop and listen!

193
00:39:05,268 --> 00:39:09,107
And we'll be sailing, sailing...

194
00:39:09,308 --> 00:39:12,188
No, not sailing!

195
00:39:12,689 --> 00:39:16,883
We'll be flying like seagulls.

196
00:39:17,478 --> 00:39:19,510
So good!

197
00:39:29,493 --> 00:39:31,261
No...

198
00:39:31,461 --> 00:39:34,385
...I'm not marrying her.

199
00:39:34,586 --> 00:39:37,840
I won't do it. For you.

200
00:40:14,538 --> 00:40:18,358
Listen, let's be frank.

201
00:40:18,459 --> 00:40:21,643
Enough foolishness.

202
00:40:21,744 --> 00:40:25,594
You're not marrying Masha.
Prick up your ears!

203
00:40:25,795 --> 00:40:29,623
I'll never allow you!

204
00:40:32,603 --> 00:40:36,531
And you think I will allow you?

205
00:40:40,354 --> 00:40:43,492
I'll never allow you to marry Mashenka!

206
00:40:44,797 --> 00:40:48,212
And you think I will allow you to do it?

207
00:40:48,213 --> 00:40:51,520
I'll duel over her like
I did in the war!

208
00:40:51,721 --> 00:40:54,573
I'm so scared! And what's
the shouting all about?

209
00:40:54,574 --> 00:40:56,243
I'll teach you!

210
00:41:13,981 --> 00:41:17,054
No, not this way!
What are you doing?

211
00:41:17,255 --> 00:41:20,247
Let's ask her.

212
00:41:51,153 --> 00:41:54,204
What a horrible day!

213
00:45:32,400 --> 00:45:35,227
When the fishing season's over...

214
00:45:35,228 --> 00:45:37,935
...Yusuf and Alyosha must
return to the city.

215
00:45:44,848 --> 00:45:48,823
There's a festive mood everywhere...

216
00:45:59,304 --> 00:46:04,046
...except at the "Lights of
Communism" kolkhoz...

217
00:46:27,028 --> 00:46:30,553
The sea has taken from us...

218
00:46:30,754 --> 00:46:34,157
...a beloved comrade.

219
00:46:34,358 --> 00:46:38,828
It took away our valiant
brigade boss from us.

220
00:46:38,829 --> 00:46:41,784
Mashenka is no longer...

221
00:46:41,985 --> 00:46:44,076
...with us.

222
00:46:46,825 --> 00:46:51,032
We lost a very dear friend.

223
00:49:25,473 --> 00:49:27,270
Who died?

224
00:49:27,271 --> 00:49:29,282
Tell me!

225
00:49:30,550 --> 00:49:34,185
- You died.
- Yes, you.

226
00:50:22,671 --> 00:50:28,894
To the number one female
brigade boss! Mashenka!

227
00:51:37,912 --> 00:51:41,945
Comrades! There are better
stakhanovites among us than I!

228
00:51:41,946 --> 00:51:44,295
Let me down!

229
00:51:48,193 --> 00:51:50,873
Comrades! Please!

230
00:51:50,974 --> 00:51:53,948
Alyosha! You're my friend, right?

231
00:52:01,307 --> 00:52:04,364
Stop it! My head is spinning!

232
00:52:08,380 --> 00:52:10,593
You're my friend, right?

233
00:52:10,594 --> 00:52:13,376
Stop, comrades, please!

234
00:52:35,601 --> 00:52:37,749
Thank you, comrades.

235
00:52:37,950 --> 00:52:42,975
I have things to do now.
Alyosha is waiting for me.

236
00:53:15,209 --> 00:53:18,216
Comrades... He has to try the suit on.

237
00:53:18,451 --> 00:53:23,487
Maybe it's not his size.
Or he doesn't like the cut.

238
00:53:23,971 --> 00:53:29,084
You're right. He's got to try it on.
Perhaps it won't fit.

239
00:53:29,285 --> 00:53:33,161
It's not necessary!
It's my size!

240
00:53:34,644 --> 00:53:36,652
Don't you listen when I speak to you?

241
00:53:46,299 --> 00:53:49,854
Mashenka!
I want to tell you something.

242
00:53:49,855 --> 00:53:55,664
Alyosha's waiting!
Can't you understand?

243
00:53:55,665 --> 00:54:02,834
- He'll wait!
- Fits me fine! Stop torturing me!

244
00:54:03,235 --> 00:54:06,045
No! Don't take my pants off!

245
00:54:06,145 --> 00:54:12,739
Grandpa! They're taking away the
woman I love. Do you understand?

246
00:54:12,740 --> 00:54:14,887
But, what are you doing?

247
00:54:14,888 --> 00:54:17,883
You've got to try it on.

248
00:54:19,148 --> 00:54:25,729
My own happiness could be at risk!

249
00:54:26,909 --> 00:54:29,621
Don't tickle me!

250
00:54:29,722 --> 00:54:35,698
Enough! I tell you it fits fine!

251
00:54:53,670 --> 00:54:55,667
Are you ready?

252
00:55:21,641 --> 00:55:22,732
Alyoshka!

253
00:56:03,424 --> 00:56:07,036
Don't be afraid.
I'm not going with her.

254
00:56:07,137 --> 00:56:08,857
And I say you should go.

255
00:56:08,958 --> 00:56:11,819
I can't now. Maybe some other day.

256
00:56:11,820 --> 00:56:13,844
I'm going, then.

257
00:56:13,945 --> 00:56:17,014
- Where are you going?
- Let me through!

258
00:56:23,532 --> 00:56:25,799
Open!

259
00:56:26,948 --> 00:56:30,852
- What's wrong?
-  Nothing, nothing!

260
00:56:56,663 --> 00:56:58,686
All right!

261
00:57:06,116 --> 00:57:13,083
Grandpa, I told you I didn't
need to try it on.

262
00:57:13,384 --> 00:57:16,340
Did you see what happened?

263
00:57:50,766 --> 00:57:55,731
- I love you, Masha.
- What do you mean you love me?

264
00:57:56,775 --> 00:57:59,770
That I love you. Just that.

265
00:58:03,944 --> 00:58:06,599
What are you saying, Alyosha?

266
00:58:07,698 --> 00:58:12,434
Darling, good, brave...

267
00:58:30,907 --> 00:58:34,080
I don't love her.

268
00:58:36,795 --> 00:58:37,954
What about her?

269
00:58:37,955 --> 00:58:40,461
- I think she loves you.
- Liar!

270
00:58:40,562 --> 00:58:42,116
Ask her yourself.

271
00:58:42,317 --> 00:58:46,883
You don't love her at
all or only a little bit?

272
00:59:09,688 --> 00:59:11,716
Sit down.

273
00:59:17,157 --> 00:59:19,088
We have to talk.

274
00:59:21,506 --> 00:59:23,793
Yes, let's talk.

275
00:59:29,757 --> 00:59:32,990
We'll go by the sea.

276
00:59:35,159 --> 00:59:39,212
I wanted to explain everything
to Alyosha, but he left.

277
00:59:39,413 --> 00:59:42,943
Listen carefully and you'll understand.

278
00:59:42,944 --> 00:59:46,913
Yes, I'll understand.
I love you, Mashenka.

279
00:59:52,269 --> 00:59:54,925
I'm in love with somebody else.

280
01:00:01,987 --> 01:00:05,036
Forgive me. He lied to me again.

281
01:00:05,137 --> 01:00:09,208
- Who?
- Alyosha. He said that you loved me.

282
01:00:10,409 --> 01:00:12,718
- Wait!
- Leave me alone!

283
01:00:21,245 --> 01:00:23,158
Look.

284
01:00:27,368 --> 01:00:30,268
Your brother? Nice looking guy.

285
01:00:30,369 --> 01:00:34,363
He's not my brother.
He's my fiancee.

286
01:00:34,921 --> 01:00:38,055
I promised I'd marry him.

287
01:00:41,156 --> 01:00:43,848
He's far away now...

288
01:00:43,849 --> 01:00:45,720
...in the Pacific.

289
01:00:49,466 --> 01:00:53,064
So what? I love you so much.

290
01:00:53,065 --> 01:00:55,206
I love you!

291
01:00:55,307 --> 01:01:01,162
You have to understand! If you
were called for military duty...

292
01:01:02,481 --> 01:01:06,414
...and had to go far away,
to the frontier...

293
01:01:07,094 --> 01:01:11,131
...and your girl found someone else?

294
01:01:11,872 --> 01:01:14,888
If she got tired of waiting for you...

295
01:01:16,298 --> 01:01:20,472
...would you not suffer?

296
01:01:21,735 --> 01:01:23,760
Think about it.

297
01:01:29,559 --> 01:01:31,639
You're right.

298
01:01:33,800 --> 01:01:38,426
But I love you a lot more.

299
01:01:59,701 --> 01:02:01,644
Come a moment.

300
01:02:15,500 --> 01:02:18,943
Goodbye, Lyuba.

301
01:02:20,126 --> 01:02:22,977
Goodbye, Petka.

302
01:02:24,053 --> 01:02:26,463
- Where are you going?
- Home.

303
01:02:26,564 --> 01:02:29,380
There's fishing there too.

304
01:02:29,780 --> 01:02:34,377
- And the motor boat?
- You take charge.

305
01:02:37,641 --> 01:02:39,767
Goodbye, Alyosha.

306
01:02:39,768 --> 01:02:42,783
Goodbye, Petka.

307
01:03:22,221 --> 01:03:27,675
My regards to everyone at the kolkhoz!

308
01:03:38,446 --> 01:03:41,928
I'll send the boat with the
fishermen back tomorrow!

309
01:03:47,697 --> 01:03:51,851
- Who set out to sea?
- Alyosha.

310
01:03:52,052 --> 01:03:52,852
Where's he going?

311
01:03:53,885 --> 01:03:57,598
He's going back home.

312
01:03:59,583 --> 01:04:02,666
Alyosha's going back home!

313
01:04:08,279 --> 01:04:11,383
Wait for me!

314
01:04:12,547 --> 01:04:15,377
Mashenka, then...

315
01:04:26,064 --> 01:04:29,694
I'm also going back home.

316
01:04:41,809 --> 01:04:47,660
Give my regards to everyone
at the kolkhoz!

317
01:04:48,723 --> 01:04:52,296
With all my love.

318
01:04:58,528 --> 01:05:03,193
- Don't tickle me!
- I'd forgotten...

319
01:05:26,352 --> 01:05:28,873
She doesn't love either of us.

320
01:05:28,874 --> 01:05:31,574
So what do I care!
She's not even pretty!

321
01:05:31,575 --> 01:05:33,584
Why are you lying?

322
01:05:33,785 --> 01:05:37,619
She's very pretty and nice.

323
01:05:37,620 --> 01:05:41,046
And you love her,
and so do I...

324
01:05:41,047 --> 01:05:44,320
...it's just that she was
already engaged.

325
01:05:44,321 --> 01:05:45,917
A fiancee?

326
01:05:46,018 --> 01:05:53,868
He's serving. They've sent
him to the Pacific.

327
01:05:56,226 --> 01:05:59,977
He left four years ago and
she still thinks about him!

328
01:05:59,978 --> 01:06:06,007
And what about us,
if we had a fiancee...

329
01:06:07,403 --> 01:06:13,426
...and they sent us to the Pacific?
Huh?

01:06:13,727 --> 01:06:17,380
And if your girl were to
find another man?

331
01:06:17,381 --> 01:06:21,530
Your heart would suffer.

332
01:06:21,531 --> 01:06:25,702
We'd be feeling bad.

333
01:06:27,462 --> 01:06:29,480
Very bad.

334
01:06:30,120 --> 01:06:32,844
Don't you agree?

335
01:06:34,262 --> 01:06:38,946
"Soar higher, seagull...

336
01:06:38,947 --> 01:06:43,250
"...night is falling over
the blue sea...

337
01:06:43,251 --> 01:06:48,642
"Hasten your flight and find out...

338
01:06:48,643 --> 01:06:51,669
"... how my loved one fares.-

01:06:51,670 --> 01:06:58,689
"Tell him how much I miss him...

340
01:07:00,961 --> 01:07:05,187
"... and that my love will never cease."
