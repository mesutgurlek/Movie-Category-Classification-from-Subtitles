1
00:01:04,297 --> 00:01:06,561
It'll be fine as long as there is happiness
Oh God!

2
00:01:11,838 --> 00:01:15,330
Everybody dreams.

3
00:01:15,575 --> 00:01:19,671
But only a handful of people
see their dreams realized.

4
00:01:19,846 --> 00:01:22,747
Want to be a star?

5
00:01:23,016 --> 00:01:25,177
You're perfect!

6
00:01:25,785 --> 00:01:29,221
The rest of us...

7
00:01:40,166 --> 00:01:42,600
accept our fate...

8
00:01:47,207 --> 00:01:49,232
fall into ruin...

9
00:01:55,281 --> 00:01:57,579
kill ourselves...

10
00:02:00,120 --> 00:02:01,747
Let's break up.

11
00:02:03,723 --> 00:02:05,486
Laugh it off...

12
00:02:06,226 --> 00:02:07,625
Don't come near!

13
00:02:08,862 --> 00:02:13,959
Committed crime
and running after by the goddness.

14
00:02:16,069 --> 00:02:21,200
Life with you...

15
00:02:22,742 --> 00:02:24,869
is a terrible bore.

16
00:02:25,011 --> 00:02:26,444
I feel like dying.

17
00:02:28,915 --> 00:02:30,849
You have no way out.

18
00:02:31,184 --> 00:02:33,516
At any rate...

19
00:02:33,820 --> 00:02:35,447
the future's hopeless.

20
00:02:53,239 --> 00:02:54,866
You quit your band.

21
00:02:56,576 --> 00:02:58,441
So now what?

22
00:03:00,146 --> 00:03:00,840
Sex!

23
00:03:00,947 --> 00:03:01,379
Sex!

24
00:03:01,514 --> 00:03:02,310
Sex!

25
00:03:15,428 --> 00:03:17,623
It's not too late!

26
00:03:18,097 --> 00:03:19,223
Shut up!

27
00:03:19,766 --> 00:03:23,759
You can start over!

28
00:03:28,641 --> 00:03:29,801
Fuck it.

29
00:03:49,729 --> 00:03:54,063
And then a familiar voice called to me.

30
00:04:30,203 --> 00:04:37,006
Reach out. Stretch up high

31
00:04:37,210 --> 00:04:43,911
And grab a star

32
00:04:44,117 --> 00:04:45,243
Matsuko!

33
00:05:20,620 --> 00:05:22,611
Hi, Son.

34
00:05:23,156 --> 00:05:24,487
Dad!

35
00:05:25,425 --> 00:05:30,522
I need a favor of you.

36
00:05:31,097 --> 00:05:34,089
I hadn't seen my Dad in 2 years.

37
00:05:34,267 --> 00:05:37,828
Ever since I left home at 18 for Tokyo...

38
00:05:38,171 --> 00:05:41,140
to become a musician.

39
00:05:49,482 --> 00:05:50,949
What's that?

40
00:05:51,284 --> 00:05:52,512
Ashes.

41
00:05:52,719 --> 00:05:54,084
Mom?

42
00:05:57,223 --> 00:06:02,684
I never told you
I had an older sister Matsuko.

43
00:06:03,563 --> 00:06:07,226
She vanished about 30 years ago.

44
00:06:09,302 --> 00:06:14,330
She was found dead in a park
3 days ago.

45
00:06:14,640 --> 00:06:18,667
My dad came to Tokyo to cremate her.

46
00:06:18,878 --> 00:06:21,506
She was 53...

47
00:06:24,984 --> 00:06:28,750
living alone in an apartment.

48
00:06:29,122 --> 00:06:33,650
My dad had to return home that day.

49
00:06:33,826 --> 00:06:38,490
So he asked me to go clean up
her apartment.

50
00:06:39,198 --> 00:06:41,723
She was hopeless.

51
00:06:42,402 --> 00:06:45,838
And now she's been murdered.

52
00:06:46,572 --> 00:06:48,096
Murderer!?

53
00:06:48,508 --> 00:06:51,636
The killer's still at large.

54
00:06:53,146 --> 00:06:57,139
Her life was meaningless.

55
00:07:10,062 --> 00:07:12,257
Meaningless.

56
00:07:13,533 --> 00:07:17,492
4 pm, July 10, 2001.

57
00:07:17,670 --> 00:07:23,165
The body of a middle-aged woman
was found on a riverbank.

58
00:07:26,446 --> 00:07:28,107
According to the police...

59
00:07:28,314 --> 00:07:33,115
she was identified as Matsuko Kawajiri.

60
00:07:33,352 --> 00:07:37,311
A tenant of a run-down apartment building.

61
00:07:38,491 --> 00:07:42,928
She had been severely beaten...

62
00:07:43,162 --> 00:07:45,790
"Murder, Say Police"

63
00:07:48,067 --> 00:07:49,364
What a mess!

64
00:08:05,451 --> 00:08:07,282
A teen idol band?

65
00:08:08,521 --> 00:08:10,011
Concrete jungle!

66
00:08:21,167 --> 00:08:22,828
Disgusting.

67
00:08:36,382 --> 00:08:37,713
This is her?

68
00:08:38,985 --> 00:08:40,577
Aunt Matsuko?

69
00:08:48,261 --> 00:08:53,563
That was scribbled by the lady who
died 4 days ago.

70
00:08:55,301 --> 00:08:57,792
She was...

71
00:08:58,271 --> 00:09:00,034
a nuisance.

72
00:09:02,942 --> 00:09:06,571
A neighborhood pest.

73
00:09:06,712 --> 00:09:08,577
Fuckin' crazy!

74
00:09:10,216 --> 00:09:14,915
Well, I'm her relative.

75
00:09:15,922 --> 00:09:19,119
Her neighbor, Shuji.

76
00:09:19,325 --> 00:09:22,590
Despite his anti-social demeanor...

77
00:09:22,828 --> 00:09:26,958
My body is my canvas.

78
00:09:27,333 --> 00:09:29,426
He was oddly friendly.

79
00:09:33,973 --> 00:09:41,141
People called the lady here
Matsuko the Outcast.

80
00:09:41,914 --> 00:09:46,749
Never threw out her trash.
Never said a word.

81
00:09:47,019 --> 00:09:51,581
She smelled weird.

82
00:09:51,891 --> 00:09:57,295
Sometimes, she'd scream her head off.

83
00:10:02,168 --> 00:10:04,363
Teen idols?

84
00:10:06,939 --> 00:10:13,174
I often saw her on the riverbank
just staring at the water.

85
00:10:14,113 --> 00:10:15,546
River?

86
00:10:47,046 --> 00:10:49,105
Mystifying.

87
00:10:50,616 --> 00:10:54,177
Not for the hero detective.

88
00:10:58,758 --> 00:11:00,020
Hi, Officer!

89
00:11:02,428 --> 00:11:05,659
Fuckin' scary!

90
00:11:05,898 --> 00:11:10,961
Seen him? He lived with the victim
18 years ago.

91
00:11:11,170 --> 00:11:14,697
He was released from prison last month.

92
00:11:16,275 --> 00:11:18,175
You think he did it?

93
00:11:18,344 --> 00:11:22,804
Don't know.
But he's been spotted around here.

94
00:11:22,982 --> 00:11:24,176
Hey, you!

95
00:11:24,884 --> 00:11:27,512
What do you know of her?

96
00:11:27,820 --> 00:11:29,253
Nothing.

97
00:11:30,322 --> 00:11:32,449
She liked teen idols?

98
00:11:33,559 --> 00:11:35,288
Her life...

99
00:11:36,128 --> 00:11:38,221
was meaningless.

100
00:11:48,007 --> 00:11:49,770
"Forgive me..."

101
00:11:55,047 --> 00:11:57,538
"Forgive me for being born."

102
00:12:00,486 --> 00:12:02,044
Who was she?

103
00:12:02,254 --> 00:12:03,448
Schoolteacher.

104
00:12:09,795 --> 00:12:12,992
A junior high teacher.

105
00:12:21,240 --> 00:12:25,142
Popular, too. Beautiful voice.

106
00:12:25,244 --> 00:12:30,614
The moon is crying, a star sparkles

107
00:12:30,783 --> 00:12:36,244
That's where hope lies

108
00:12:37,022 --> 00:12:39,889
Knowledge is endless

109
00:12:40,226 --> 00:12:43,457
Matsuko, age 23, 1971

110
00:12:43,896 --> 00:12:48,731
And stars reach into endlessness

111
00:13:11,524 --> 00:13:15,290
Then came an incident at a school outing.

112
00:13:15,528 --> 00:13:17,553
Get back to your rooms.

113
00:13:20,733 --> 00:13:23,634
A student stole money...

114
00:13:24,870 --> 00:13:28,169
from the inn's shop.

115
00:13:28,374 --> 00:13:30,934
About $100.

116
00:13:31,377 --> 00:13:33,902
Ryu was missing from dinner last night.

117
00:13:34,113 --> 00:13:35,239
So what?

118
00:13:35,447 --> 00:13:38,075
He was the only one missing.

119
00:13:38,317 --> 00:13:39,909
Don't accuse him!

120
00:13:40,119 --> 00:13:42,383
We're not accusing him.

121
00:13:43,756 --> 00:13:47,317
We just want you to talk to him.

122
00:13:48,027 --> 00:13:50,188
He's your student!

123
00:13:50,262 --> 00:13:50,887
Do it!

124
00:13:51,063 --> 00:13:51,961
Yes, Sir!

125
00:13:53,766 --> 00:13:55,290
I'll join you.

126
00:13:57,770 --> 00:14:01,968
For moral support.

127
00:14:03,442 --> 00:14:06,934
That's okay. I'm his teacher.

128
00:14:07,446 --> 00:14:10,938
I trust my students.

129
00:14:12,251 --> 00:14:17,382
I selected my words carefully
so as not to hurt his feelings.

130
00:14:17,590 --> 00:14:20,024
Did you take the money?

131
00:14:20,860 --> 00:14:25,388
I believe you but the other teachers...

132
00:14:25,631 --> 00:14:29,590
I'd like to hear it from you.

133
00:14:29,802 --> 00:14:32,236
You think I did it.

134
00:14:33,472 --> 00:14:37,909
If it's returned
the owner won't call the police.

135
00:14:38,110 --> 00:14:40,101
We'll apologize together.

136
00:14:40,813 --> 00:14:42,041
Forget it!

137
00:14:45,551 --> 00:14:47,212
Oh no.

138
00:14:47,820 --> 00:14:50,914
Is it me?

139
00:14:51,190 --> 00:14:52,987
My fault?

140
00:14:53,158 --> 00:14:55,524
No, Ryu's to blame.

141
00:14:55,761 --> 00:14:57,160
He stole!

142
00:14:57,396 --> 00:14:58,488
Damn you!

143
00:14:58,764 --> 00:15:01,062
Wait, I know!

144
00:15:02,768 --> 00:15:06,260
I'll return the money myself...

145
00:15:06,505 --> 00:15:12,171
and say I got it from
the remorseful student.

146
00:15:12,745 --> 00:15:15,680
Not enough!

147
00:15:25,124 --> 00:15:27,558
I'll pay it right back!

148
00:15:28,327 --> 00:15:30,056
I promise!

149
00:15:31,263 --> 00:15:34,357
He feels terrible about it!

150
00:15:39,672 --> 00:15:42,732
Then bring him here.

151
00:15:42,942 --> 00:15:46,673
He needs to apologize!

152
00:15:47,046 --> 00:15:49,480
Let's go see him, then.

153
00:15:49,682 --> 00:15:52,344
- No! - Yes!

154
00:15:56,288 --> 00:15:59,348
You making fun of me?

155
00:16:00,392 --> 00:16:01,654
Um... no.

156
00:16:01,860 --> 00:16:02,849
Just then...

157
00:16:03,062 --> 00:16:04,689
It wasn't him.

158
00:16:04,930 --> 00:16:08,195
I just wanted this over.

159
00:16:08,400 --> 00:16:09,992
I took it!

160
00:16:10,235 --> 00:16:11,964
I took the money!

161
00:16:15,574 --> 00:16:18,634
You were letting your students
take the blame...

162
00:16:19,044 --> 00:16:21,035
for a crime you committed?

163
00:16:21,280 --> 00:16:22,838
I'm sorry!

164
00:16:28,787 --> 00:16:31,847
I wasn't going to the police anyway.

165
00:16:37,029 --> 00:16:38,621
Ms. Kawajiri?

166
00:16:39,531 --> 00:16:41,556
But why?

167
00:16:45,704 --> 00:16:49,731
Let's not tell the other teachers.

168
00:16:50,676 --> 00:16:54,874
We'll let the inn believe you did it.

169
00:16:55,080 --> 00:16:59,244
And the school will pretend
nothing happened.

170
00:16:59,451 --> 00:17:01,419
We've no other choice.

171
00:17:03,922 --> 00:17:06,584
As for you, Ms. Kawajiri...

172
00:17:06,925 --> 00:17:08,984
I'm sorry.

173
00:17:10,062 --> 00:17:11,359
How sorry?

174
00:17:11,563 --> 00:17:13,258
Well...

175
00:17:13,899 --> 00:17:19,064
Show me with actions, not words!

176
00:17:19,238 --> 00:17:21,934
Yes, sir!

177
00:17:22,608 --> 00:17:27,944
If you're really sorry
then show me your breasts.

178
00:17:28,814 --> 00:17:30,406
Show me!

179
00:17:30,549 --> 00:17:31,982
Now!

180
00:17:37,189 --> 00:17:38,884
Ms. Kawajiri?

181
00:17:49,168 --> 00:17:53,628
It was all a mistake by the inn.

182
00:17:54,473 --> 00:17:55,838
Yes.

183
00:17:56,708 --> 00:18:00,974
People can be so silly.

184
00:18:05,751 --> 00:18:07,082
Ms. Kawajiri?

185
00:18:07,953 --> 00:18:11,150
He looked me in the eye and said...

186
00:18:12,057 --> 00:18:15,493
How would you like...

187
00:18:15,661 --> 00:18:18,892
to go bowling on Sunday?

188
00:18:19,131 --> 00:18:20,826
Then I said...

189
00:18:21,033 --> 00:18:25,231
"Are you asking me out on a date?"

190
00:18:25,504 --> 00:18:29,304
Then he blushed.

191
00:18:30,442 --> 00:18:31,636
Yes.

192
00:18:34,446 --> 00:18:37,347
Is he handsome?

193
00:18:37,549 --> 00:18:40,541
Yes, and his teeth!

194
00:18:41,053 --> 00:18:43,613
Sparkling white.

195
00:18:45,858 --> 00:18:48,656
Good for you, Sis.

196
00:18:49,595 --> 00:18:51,620
Thanks.

197
00:18:51,797 --> 00:18:54,527
I promise to be happy.

198
00:19:01,106 --> 00:19:04,507
Why'd you tell your sister
you have a date?

199
00:19:07,012 --> 00:19:09,537
You know she's ill.

200
00:19:10,782 --> 00:19:13,216
She can't go out.

201
00:19:14,720 --> 00:19:17,086
She can't date.

202
00:19:17,556 --> 00:19:20,719
Have you considered her feelings?

203
00:19:22,027 --> 00:19:24,427
Have you no sympathy?

204
00:19:31,670 --> 00:19:32,967
Hi, Sis.

205
00:19:34,439 --> 00:19:36,498
I don't feel...

206
00:19:38,277 --> 00:19:40,336
the least bit sorry for you!

207
00:19:44,883 --> 00:19:45,713
Matsuko!

208
00:19:53,992 --> 00:19:57,792
Dad had always been like this.

209
00:20:04,703 --> 00:20:07,433
Matsuko, age 7, 1955

210
00:20:07,606 --> 00:20:10,598
Reach out, stretch up high:

211
00:20:10,776 --> 00:20:16,806
And grab a star

212
00:20:17,049 --> 00:20:25,650
Stretch up high as you can

213
00:20:25,958 --> 00:20:31,021
He adored my sick sister, Kumi.

214
00:20:31,263 --> 00:20:32,662
I was always alone.

215
00:20:54,119 --> 00:20:56,019
But one time...

216
00:20:56,288 --> 00:21:01,419
after visiting Kumi in the hospital
he took me to a department store.

217
00:21:04,930 --> 00:21:08,024
I ate pancakes for the first time.

218
00:21:09,434 --> 00:21:12,232
It was just the two of us.

219
00:21:13,338 --> 00:21:19,436
I walk the road where candy trees grow

220
00:21:19,845 --> 00:21:26,648
I dance in the woods in magical shoes

221
00:21:26,852 --> 00:21:32,950
Nobody hates the smile on my face

222
00:21:33,158 --> 00:21:40,587
And every word I say turns into music

223
00:22:11,563 --> 00:22:15,897
Because of Kumi's illness
dad was always sad.

224
00:22:16,101 --> 00:22:18,569
But I made him smile.

225
00:22:19,404 --> 00:22:25,343
After that I tried to win his favor
by making that face.

226
00:22:32,751 --> 00:22:35,276
I wanted his attention...

227
00:22:35,520 --> 00:22:37,420
his love.

228
00:22:38,423 --> 00:22:42,621
In my schooling and in my job...

229
00:22:42,761 --> 00:22:47,562
I worked hard to make him proud.
And yet...

230
00:22:47,766 --> 00:22:51,793
I wish I could see Kumi like this.

231
00:22:59,578 --> 00:23:00,704
Be serious.

232
00:23:00,979 --> 00:23:04,779
But my efforts were in vain.

233
00:23:05,050 --> 00:23:07,917
I started making that
face in tense situations...

234
00:23:08,220 --> 00:23:13,522
without realizing it.

235
00:23:13,759 --> 00:23:17,217
You making fun of me?

236
00:23:22,901 --> 00:23:26,735
That's my 24 years.

237
00:23:28,440 --> 00:23:29,930
Interesting.

238
00:23:31,743 --> 00:23:35,144
I called you out at this hour just to...

239
00:23:35,347 --> 00:23:37,645
talk your ear off. I'm sorry.

240
00:23:37,949 --> 00:23:42,181
No, I'm glad you did.

241
00:23:44,456 --> 00:23:48,256
That's such a relief.

242
00:23:48,427 --> 00:23:51,089
Now that we're seeing each other...

243
00:23:51,363 --> 00:23:55,424
I think you should know about me.

244
00:23:56,902 --> 00:23:58,699
Well, I'm...

245
00:23:59,671 --> 00:24:01,605
really glad.

246
00:24:04,042 --> 00:24:11,141
The inn asked us to go easy on you
for stealing their money.

247
00:24:11,650 --> 00:24:15,416
Yet I heard from the head teacher...

248
00:24:15,620 --> 00:24:20,853
that you came crying to him
to keep this a secret.

249
00:24:21,092 --> 00:24:22,525
That's a lie!

250
00:24:23,261 --> 00:24:28,494
Then we heard from
the teacher you roomed with...

251
00:24:29,167 --> 00:24:34,833
money was missing from her wallet.

252
00:24:35,140 --> 00:24:37,040
I'll return everything

253
00:24:38,076 --> 00:24:39,441
Was it you?

254
00:24:39,611 --> 00:24:43,377
No! I mean it was a student
who stole from the inn.

255
00:24:43,648 --> 00:24:46,640
But he wouldn't admit it.

256
00:24:46,852 --> 00:24:50,549
Yes or no?

257
00:24:50,722 --> 00:24:51,950
Yes, but only...

258
00:24:52,123 --> 00:24:52,919
Thief!

259
00:24:53,124 --> 00:24:56,355
No, I can explain! Please wait.

260
00:24:58,263 --> 00:25:01,323
Please come forward, I beg you!

261
00:25:01,466 --> 00:25:04,924
If not, I'll be blamed for everything!

262
00:25:05,136 --> 00:25:05,932
Why?

263
00:25:06,137 --> 00:25:09,072
Because I was trying to protect you!

264
00:25:09,441 --> 00:25:13,002
Why'd you do that? You hate me.

265
00:25:13,078 --> 00:25:14,204
I hate you!

266
00:25:15,313 --> 00:25:17,076
No... I don't.

267
00:25:17,449 --> 00:25:19,076
All right.

268
00:25:19,751 --> 00:25:23,687
I confess. I stole the money.

269
00:25:24,990 --> 00:25:28,619
We've asked Mr. Saeki to join us.

270
00:25:28,793 --> 00:25:30,192
Tell the truth.

271
00:25:33,498 --> 00:25:39,698
It was you who stole from the inn, right?

272
00:25:43,041 --> 00:25:46,033
I didn't steal any money.

273
00:25:47,412 --> 00:25:49,073
A few minutes ago...

274
00:25:49,281 --> 00:25:54,810
Ms. Kawajiri threatened me...
telling me to take the blame.

275
00:25:56,054 --> 00:25:59,114
Ms. Kawajiri, you're despicable!

276
00:26:01,993 --> 00:26:04,086
This isn't a joke!

277
00:26:04,429 --> 00:26:09,093
At that moment, I felt my life was over.

278
00:26:18,276 --> 00:26:22,770
I was summarily forced to resign.

279
00:26:38,163 --> 00:26:39,323
Sis?

280
00:26:43,835 --> 00:26:45,063
I'm leaving.

281
00:26:45,303 --> 00:26:47,271
No, don't!

282
00:26:47,505 --> 00:26:51,066
Don't go!

283
00:27:02,754 --> 00:27:05,518
It's all your fault!

284
00:27:06,191 --> 00:27:09,024
Because of you!

285
00:27:09,260 --> 00:27:12,957
It's all because of you!

286
00:27:13,164 --> 00:27:14,324
Matsuko!

287
00:27:22,540 --> 00:27:24,940
No!

288
00:27:41,693 --> 00:27:47,154
I know I've seen this face
before somewhere.

289
00:27:47,465 --> 00:27:49,763
She was crying.

290
00:28:00,478 --> 00:28:05,575
She sat staring at the river
tears streaming from her face.

291
00:28:05,950 --> 00:28:10,478
She was nuts, I tell you.

292
00:28:12,657 --> 00:28:14,454
Don't "tsk-tsk" me.

293
00:28:24,402 --> 00:28:26,063
Fuck!

294
00:28:30,341 --> 00:28:33,936
Look! There!

295
00:28:40,819 --> 00:28:43,151
It's him!

296
00:28:46,057 --> 00:28:47,285
Murderer!

297
00:29:37,642 --> 00:29:43,842
Of course, my dad called only to see
if I'd finished the job.

298
00:29:44,048 --> 00:29:46,380
She was a teacher, wasn't she?

299
00:29:46,818 --> 00:29:49,685
Yeah. So?

300
00:29:49,854 --> 00:29:51,344
And a good singer, too?

301
00:29:51,623 --> 00:29:53,090
Who cares?

302
00:29:53,792 --> 00:29:56,283
We cut all ties with her.

303
00:29:56,995 --> 00:29:58,587
Why?

304
00:29:58,830 --> 00:30:00,354
Because...

305
00:30:03,201 --> 00:30:09,367
after she left
she became a "massage parlor girl."

306
00:30:09,874 --> 00:30:12,934
And a murderer!

307
00:30:17,415 --> 00:30:22,375
Hope to see you at the carnival

308
00:30:22,754 --> 00:30:27,054
Outrageous swimming suits

309
00:30:28,393 --> 00:30:33,126
The summer sun is too too hot

310
00:30:33,731 --> 00:30:38,498
No way!

311
00:30:44,042 --> 00:30:47,478
How you been, my little brother?

312
00:30:47,679 --> 00:30:48,941
What do you want?

313
00:30:49,681 --> 00:30:51,876
Nothing.

314
00:30:53,384 --> 00:30:55,409
Living with a man?

315
00:30:55,753 --> 00:30:59,189
An aspiring writer... very kind.

316
00:30:59,390 --> 00:31:02,621
Liar, liar, liar!

317
00:31:02,894 --> 00:31:05,260
It's because of you I can't write!
Go sell your body!

318
00:31:05,530 --> 00:31:09,022
Earn some money!

319
00:31:09,267 --> 00:31:10,359
Tetsuya!

320
00:31:11,336 --> 00:31:13,201
What do you want?

321
00:31:13,805 --> 00:31:15,272
Money.

322
00:31:15,473 --> 00:31:16,838
I knew it.

323
00:31:19,177 --> 00:31:23,477
You're a woman.
Get work as a hostess or something.

324
00:31:24,449 --> 00:31:27,043
I won't do that kind of work.

325
00:31:27,318 --> 00:31:30,651
Liar, liar, liar!

326
00:31:30,955 --> 00:31:32,582
Okay, strip.

327
00:31:32,991 --> 00:31:34,891
Right now?

328
00:31:35,093 --> 00:31:37,618
Right now. Everything.

329
00:31:46,571 --> 00:31:49,062
Sorry. You're not right.

330
00:31:51,142 --> 00:31:53,201
How's Kumi?

331
00:31:54,712 --> 00:31:59,376
She hasn't been the same. She mumbles.

332
00:31:59,617 --> 00:32:03,644
Sometimes, she won't talk or eat for days.

333
00:32:03,855 --> 00:32:06,449
You destroyed our family.

334
00:32:06,891 --> 00:32:09,325
Don't ever come back.

335
00:32:16,401 --> 00:32:18,733
You're dead to us.

336
00:32:20,405 --> 00:32:23,203
And dad?

337
00:32:23,341 --> 00:32:25,468
Is he angry with me?

338
00:32:26,077 --> 00:32:29,046
Dad's dead.

339
00:32:30,615 --> 00:32:35,109
Suffered a stroke on the toilet.

340
00:32:36,888 --> 00:32:38,856
3 months after you left.

341
00:32:42,860 --> 00:32:44,259
What?

342
00:32:46,698 --> 00:32:50,190
What do I need to do

343
00:32:50,368 --> 00:32:55,431
To earn your love

344
00:32:55,640 --> 00:33:00,304
Please tell me

345
00:33:17,795 --> 00:33:19,228
Okano-san?

346
00:33:19,897 --> 00:33:23,765
I was just in the neighborhood.

347
00:33:25,136 --> 00:33:28,663
How's Tetsuya's writing going?

348
00:33:28,840 --> 00:33:32,241
He's my arch rival, you know.

349
00:33:37,982 --> 00:33:41,349
He still drinks and gets violent?

350
00:33:41,786 --> 00:33:47,053
He's spirited... fancies himself
as Osamu Dazai reborn.

351
00:33:47,258 --> 00:33:50,694
To be frank, he's not...

352
00:33:51,095 --> 00:33:52,528
Not what?

353
00:33:53,264 --> 00:33:54,856
Welcome back.

354
00:34:01,339 --> 00:34:02,636
I'll be going.

355
00:34:10,048 --> 00:34:11,845
Get hired?

356
00:34:12,283 --> 00:34:15,616
No, they didn't want me.

357
00:34:15,853 --> 00:34:17,320
Is that so?

358
00:34:28,266 --> 00:34:30,734
Did he see my work?

359
00:34:32,637 --> 00:34:36,573
He's no writer. He works by day.

360
00:34:38,342 --> 00:34:41,175
I've devoted my life!

361
00:34:42,313 --> 00:34:46,147
I borrowed money from my brother.

362
00:35:03,501 --> 00:35:06,129
With that face...

363
00:35:07,972 --> 00:35:11,464
you asked for money?

364
00:35:14,545 --> 00:35:18,811
He told me never to return.

365
00:35:31,429 --> 00:35:32,987
So what?

366
00:35:37,535 --> 00:35:41,096
Don't look so pathetic!

367
00:35:43,741 --> 00:35:47,643
Strip! Remove your bra, now!

368
00:35:51,048 --> 00:35:52,811
Goddammit!

369
00:35:53,584 --> 00:35:55,381
That night...

370
00:35:55,653 --> 00:36:01,489
Tetsuya vanished from my life
leaving me with one phrase.

371
00:36:02,226 --> 00:36:05,127
"Forgive me for being born."

372
00:36:45,403 --> 00:36:47,166
At that moment...

373
00:36:48,673 --> 00:36:51,870
I felt my life was over.

374
00:36:59,684 --> 00:37:02,016
But 6 months later...

375
00:37:03,087 --> 00:37:06,352
I was singing again.

376
00:37:06,991 --> 00:37:11,189
Isn't life just wonderful
Oh, my life's so beautiful

377
00:37:11,395 --> 00:37:15,798
Today's the much anticipated
Happy Wednesday

378
00:37:16,000 --> 00:37:18,059
Ah, the joy of love

379
00:37:18,269 --> 00:37:20,294
I wait for you everyday!

380
00:37:20,538 --> 00:37:22,733
When you arrive on my doorstep

381
00:37:22,940 --> 00:37:24,931
On Happy Wednesday

382
00:37:25,142 --> 00:37:27,235
Sugar, pepper, Salt and all my love

383
00:37:27,445 --> 00:37:29,470
Happy Wednesday

384
00:37:29,680 --> 00:37:31,807
Please eat soup and please at me!

385
00:37:34,151 --> 00:37:38,645
Without you I cannot live

386
00:37:38,823 --> 00:37:41,485
But once a week I get my fix

387
00:37:41,826 --> 00:37:42,724
Welcome back!

388
00:37:42,960 --> 00:37:44,860
Happy Wednesday

389
00:37:45,062 --> 00:37:48,623
I became Okano-san's lover.

390
00:37:48,833 --> 00:37:52,291
I suppose I was jealous of Tetsuya.

391
00:37:52,503 --> 00:37:56,030
He had talent and dedication.

392
00:37:56,240 --> 00:38:01,200
And an attractive girl like you.

393
00:38:02,546 --> 00:38:04,104
That hurts.

394
00:38:07,051 --> 00:38:08,848
Tetsuya, huh?

395
00:38:09,520 --> 00:38:12,353
Sorry... for reminding you.

396
00:38:18,696 --> 00:38:19,890
See ya.

397
00:38:25,736 --> 00:38:27,795
Happy Wednesday

398
00:38:30,074 --> 00:38:32,338
Happy Wednesday

399
00:38:39,183 --> 00:38:41,344
Happy Wednesday

400
00:38:58,836 --> 00:39:00,963
Are you the Missus?

401
00:39:01,339 --> 00:39:05,742
I'm looking for the Kawajiri residence.

402
00:39:06,344 --> 00:39:10,678
No one by that name around here.

403
00:39:10,881 --> 00:39:13,111
You are?

404
00:39:13,317 --> 00:39:15,182
Sorry to bother you, ma'am.

405
00:39:16,987 --> 00:39:19,319
I could beat her.

406
00:39:19,490 --> 00:39:21,355
Happy Wednesday

407
00:39:21,592 --> 00:39:23,822
I just knew it.

408
00:39:24,061 --> 00:39:25,756
Happy Wednesday

409
00:39:39,610 --> 00:39:40,702
Matsuko.

410
00:39:43,347 --> 00:39:44,245
Welcome back.

411
00:39:44,415 --> 00:39:46,349
Don't give me that!

412
00:39:55,426 --> 00:39:56,324
Quiet!

413
00:39:56,494 --> 00:39:57,722
I am!

414
00:39:58,696 --> 00:40:00,459
You came to my house.

415
00:40:03,033 --> 00:40:09,131
Okano's wife grew suspicious and
confronted him.

416
00:40:09,707 --> 00:40:12,471
So he confessed our love affair.

417
00:40:12,710 --> 00:40:16,510
That's okay. She doesn't suit you.

418
00:40:16,781 --> 00:40:20,342
You don't love her, right? So break up...

419
00:40:20,584 --> 00:40:21,983
How dare you?!

420
00:40:22,620 --> 00:40:27,717
It's you I don't love.
I've no wish to marry you.

421
00:40:28,893 --> 00:40:33,296
Who can eat food this rich?

422
00:40:34,932 --> 00:40:39,528
I just wanted what Tetsuya had.

423
00:40:39,737 --> 00:40:42,331
I felt inferior to him.

424
00:40:42,606 --> 00:40:46,633
When he died
I wanted to purge those feelings.

425
00:40:46,944 --> 00:40:50,038
So I took his lover.

426
00:40:50,214 --> 00:40:53,411
I don't understand. Please explain.

427
00:40:53,617 --> 00:40:55,585
We're through. It's over between us.

428
00:40:55,820 --> 00:40:58,015
What I did was wrong.

429
00:40:58,189 --> 00:41:04,958
I let things get too far. But I couldn't resist.

430
00:41:05,196 --> 00:41:11,396
You've a great body.

431
00:41:13,437 --> 00:41:15,371
Please take this.

432
00:41:20,444 --> 00:41:21,308
Why?

433
00:41:28,385 --> 00:41:29,613
Why?

434
00:41:36,327 --> 00:41:37,453
Why?

435
00:41:41,966 --> 00:41:42,660
Why?!

436
00:41:46,537 --> 00:41:48,562
WHY?!

437
00:41:49,907 --> 00:41:52,341
"White Nights"

438
00:41:53,344 --> 00:41:54,174
Why?

439
00:41:54,912 --> 00:41:59,008
Because my ex-lover told me...

440
00:41:59,250 --> 00:42:02,219
I have a great body.

441
00:42:02,586 --> 00:42:03,746
So?

442
00:42:04,488 --> 00:42:08,754
I think I'm suited for this job.

443
00:42:10,261 --> 00:42:11,626
Are you?

444
00:42:22,973 --> 00:42:24,167
Well?

445
00:42:27,511 --> 00:42:29,138
Hire her.

446
00:42:30,281 --> 00:42:32,181
She's interesting.

447
00:42:35,586 --> 00:42:36,746
Hands out.

448
00:42:40,357 --> 00:42:42,951
Very nice. Good luck.

449
00:42:47,831 --> 00:42:51,961
Love's a bubble. Nothing but trouble

450
00:42:52,169 --> 00:42:56,299
Let's play pretend love

451
00:42:56,674 --> 00:43:00,872
Love's a bubble. Full of trouble

452
00:43:01,045 --> 00:43:04,503
So let me lather you up

453
00:43:04,648 --> 00:43:07,208
Your new name is "Yukino."

454
00:43:13,524 --> 00:43:22,091
Real love is taboo but
I'll make you think it's true

455
00:43:22,199 --> 00:43:26,727
Focus every bodily nerve
on pleasing the customer.

456
00:43:26,937 --> 00:43:28,234
"Shy as a virgin"

457
00:43:32,142 --> 00:43:35,669
Stamina is key.

458
00:43:35,980 --> 00:43:38,448
Train those legs and hips.

459
00:43:38,882 --> 00:43:41,009
Ah, golden shower!

460
00:43:57,835 --> 00:44:01,669
Our top girl this month is... Yukino.
Great work!

461
00:44:20,824 --> 00:44:22,519
"Love Technicians!"

462
00:44:28,132 --> 00:44:30,566
"Novices are in! Pros are out!"

463
00:44:30,834 --> 00:44:33,769
Soak up a bubble bath

464
00:44:34,038 --> 00:44:35,027
"Amateur Girls!"

465
00:44:43,714 --> 00:44:45,875
Times have changed.

466
00:44:46,784 --> 00:44:49,844
Thanks for the memories.

467
00:44:57,995 --> 00:45:02,489
We may be out of style but
we still gotta live.

468
00:45:03,133 --> 00:45:06,466
Maybe I'll open a diner.

469
00:45:11,442 --> 00:45:15,742
Love's a bubble Nothing but trouble

470
00:45:15,913 --> 00:45:21,977
Money is the only thing to love

471
00:45:22,886 --> 00:45:23,875
Fired?

472
00:45:24,521 --> 00:45:27,422
I give you some love

473
00:46:10,467 --> 00:46:11,729
I'm home.

474
00:46:38,695 --> 00:46:43,132
"Kozo Kawajiri, 1971"

475
00:46:59,650 --> 00:47:01,447
"No word from Matsuko."

476
00:47:02,452 --> 00:47:03,282
"No word from Matsuko."

477
00:47:03,554 --> 00:47:05,579
Ever since I left home...

478
00:47:05,956 --> 00:47:11,019
my father had ended each diary entry
the same way.

479
00:47:11,361 --> 00:47:13,352
"No word from Matsuko."

480
00:47:18,836 --> 00:47:19,894
Matsuko.

481
00:47:21,405 --> 00:47:22,963
Daddy.

482
00:47:28,846 --> 00:47:30,780
I knew it.

483
00:47:32,216 --> 00:47:33,444
Kumi?

484
00:47:34,318 --> 00:47:36,752
You came back!

485
00:47:37,487 --> 00:47:40,650
My sister's back!

486
00:47:44,928 --> 00:47:46,725
Matsuko!

487
00:47:47,598 --> 00:47:49,225
Who are you?

488
00:47:51,134 --> 00:47:52,965
Matsuko-san?

489
00:47:54,071 --> 00:47:55,163
Money.

490
00:47:55,739 --> 00:47:57,468
For my brother!

491
00:47:57,674 --> 00:48:00,871
No, don't leave!

492
00:48:07,284 --> 00:48:09,775
Matsuko, age 26, 1974

493
00:48:09,953 --> 00:48:12,319
You were crying in your sleep.

494
00:48:12,489 --> 00:48:13,251
I'm fine.

495
00:48:13,624 --> 00:48:16,923
I drifted around near my hometown...

496
00:48:17,261 --> 00:48:20,788
and wound up with this man, Onodera.

497
00:48:20,998 --> 00:48:24,195
He was a slimy pimp looking to get rich.

498
00:48:24,601 --> 00:48:26,569
I no longer cared.

499
00:48:26,770 --> 00:48:29,295
I just hated being alone.

500
00:48:29,473 --> 00:48:33,034
And I wanted to get away.

501
00:48:33,443 --> 00:48:37,436
I hate the rain. It brings bad memories.

502
00:48:38,982 --> 00:48:43,544
Let's make some good ones, then.

503
00:49:00,103 --> 00:49:01,661
Are we through?

504
00:49:02,072 --> 00:49:03,061
Yes.

505
00:49:04,007 --> 00:49:06,908
I want my share of the money.

506
00:49:07,477 --> 00:49:11,208
6 month's worth of back pay.

507
00:49:11,381 --> 00:49:12,473
It's gone.

508
00:49:13,517 --> 00:49:15,781
I gave it all to her.

509
00:49:15,953 --> 00:49:16,851
What?

510
00:49:17,587 --> 00:49:19,987
Look at yourself!

511
00:49:20,257 --> 00:49:24,455
You're washed up!
No man will have you!

512
00:49:24,861 --> 00:49:28,388
I'm moving in with her.

513
00:49:28,699 --> 00:49:30,496
Lost!

514
00:49:31,868 --> 00:49:36,498
The rain here never seemed to stop.

515
00:49:37,808 --> 00:49:39,469
Stop that.

516
00:49:40,077 --> 00:49:41,169
Matsuko!

517
00:49:42,980 --> 00:49:45,972
Who do you think you are? I'll kill you!

518
00:49:49,052 --> 00:49:52,681
I saw a face.

519
00:49:52,956 --> 00:49:55,584
But I couldn't remember whose it was.

520
00:49:56,226 --> 00:49:58,524
Shit!

521
00:50:00,297 --> 00:50:02,993
You clumsy bitch!

522
00:50:03,400 --> 00:50:05,891
God, that hurts! Call an ambulance!

523
00:50:06,036 --> 00:50:08,937
Son of a bitch! I'll sue you!

524
00:50:09,139 --> 00:50:11,630
It hurts like hell!

525
00:50:11,842 --> 00:50:15,573
God damn you!

526
00:50:32,195 --> 00:50:34,186
At that moment...

527
00:50:34,398 --> 00:50:38,960
I was sure my life was over.

528
00:51:04,494 --> 00:51:06,121
And yet...

529
00:51:07,030 --> 00:51:10,796
my body wanted to stay alive.

Every child believes in a sparkling future.

531
00:51:25,649 --> 00:51:27,583
Then you grow up...

532
00:51:28,218 --> 00:51:31,517
and nothing goes as planned.

533
00:51:32,155 --> 00:51:37,422
There's only pain, grief and anger.

534
00:51:37,627 --> 00:51:40,152
It's all your fault.

535
00:51:40,997 --> 00:51:42,021
My fault?

536
00:51:44,901 --> 00:51:46,732
I'm sorry.

537
00:51:47,604 --> 00:51:51,040
It's not really your fault.

538
00:51:52,109 --> 00:51:54,600
It's my fault.

539
00:51:55,712 --> 00:51:57,839
I realized something.

540
00:51:58,648 --> 00:52:01,776
Why I felt so bored.

541
00:52:02,586 --> 00:52:07,990
It's because I expected you
to do everything for me.

542
00:52:09,793 --> 00:52:13,752
And did nothing myself.

543
00:52:16,199 --> 00:52:17,928
Hey, Sho?

544
00:52:19,636 --> 00:52:21,900
A person's life...

545
00:52:23,773 --> 00:52:27,470
isn't valued by what one receives.

546
00:52:28,211 --> 00:52:34,411
But... by what one gives, right?

547
00:52:38,321 --> 00:52:42,417
I've thought real hard.

548
00:52:43,093 --> 00:52:46,028
And it's made me ask myself...

549
00:52:46,630 --> 00:52:52,933
what can I do for you? Or for the world?

550
00:52:54,838 --> 00:52:57,534
So I've decided...

551
00:52:58,341 --> 00:53:04,211
to join the Peace Corps and
go to Uzbekistan.

552
00:53:07,984 --> 00:53:09,315
Uzbekistan?

553
00:53:09,419 --> 00:53:10,613
See ya.

554
00:53:12,222 --> 00:53:13,621
Hello?

555
00:53:28,271 --> 00:53:29,670
What was that?

As the widow was being ravished...

561
00:54:07,844 --> 00:54:09,505
I fell asleep.

562
00:54:10,480 --> 00:54:12,744
And had another bizarre dream.

563
00:54:14,317 --> 00:54:18,117
I was being kidnapped by a porn star.

564
00:54:19,155 --> 00:54:20,144

565
00:54:21,558 --> 00:54:23,287
Come with me.

No.

I'm her nephew! She's my dad's sister.

She and my aunt were old friends.

When the body was found...

581
00:55:40,236 --> 00:55:44,639
Matsuko was clutching
this woman's business card.

582
00:55:45,375 --> 00:55:47,741
So the police called her.

583
00:55:48,345 --> 00:55:51,109
They wouldn't tell me anything.

584
00:55:51,681 --> 00:55:56,380
So I had my men stake out her apartment.

585

They saw you.

Have they found the killer?

Not yet.

But there was a man she lived with
18 years ago.

It's him.

Pardon me but...

592
00:56:42,465 --> 00:56:44,899
how do you know my aunt?

593
00:56:55,945 --> 00:56:57,503
I met her...

594
00:56:58,481 --> 00:56:59,505
in prison.

595
00:57:01,251 --> 00:57:05,620
After stabbing him, I ran to the station.

To go where?

597
00:57:07,690 --> 00:57:08,816
I don't know.

598
00:57:09,926 --> 00:57:11,791
I just went.

599
00:57:12,095 --> 00:57:16,555
I took the Bullet Train to Tokyo.

600
00:57:16,800 --> 00:57:17,994
Bullet Train?

601
00:57:18,201 --> 00:57:21,898
I'd always wanted to ride it.

602
00:57:22,038 --> 00:57:26,975
It was like a dream.

603
00:57:27,177 --> 00:57:28,508
Skip it.

604
00:57:28,645 --> 00:57:33,673
Before I knew it
I was in Tokyo... in Mitaka.

605

Mitaka?

606
00:57:35,285 --> 00:57:39,449
I wanted to die there.

Tetsuya, the only man who ever loved me...

608
00:57:47,497 --> 00:57:51,092
believed he was the famous writer
Osamu Dazai, reborn.

609
00:57:51,367 --> 00:57:55,861
If so, I wanted to die where he took his life...

610
00:57:56,172 --> 00:57:58,936
and join Tetsuya.

611
00:57:59,142 --> 00:58:01,542
I don't quite follow.

612
00:58:01,711 --> 00:58:04,145
But you didn't die.

613
00:58:04,347 --> 00:58:05,405
I couldn't.

There's a dam up river.
All you get is a trickle here.

No. He was the sad, introverted type.

You were committing suicide.

622

623
00:58:40,817 --> 00:58:44,048
but had gentle eyes.

624
00:58:44,254 --> 00:58:46,188
Nowhere to go?

625
00:58:51,361 --> 00:58:55,058
I'm Kenji Shimazu, a barber.

626
00:58:56,933 --> 00:58:58,662
Single?

627
00:59:00,169 --> 00:59:01,500
No wife?

628
00:59:01,704 --> 00:59:04,400
Killed in an auto accident 3 years ago.

629
00:59:04,908 --> 00:59:08,002
He gave me a new look.

630
00:59:08,278 --> 00:59:11,475
I felt new again.

631
00:59:11,814 --> 00:59:15,272
We spent the night together.

632
00:59:15,485 --> 00:59:17,885
I became his assistant.

such a beautiful wife?

the rest of my life with you.

say good-bye

"Hairstylist License"

687
01:03:43,553 --> 01:03:45,953
What will you do?

688
01:03:46,155 --> 01:03:48,146
Live with Kenji.

689
01:03:48,324 --> 01:03:50,258
He knows this?

690
01:03:50,593 --> 01:03:52,857
We made a pledge.

691
01:03:53,229 --> 01:03:54,696
Has he visited?

692
01:03:55,398 --> 01:03:57,229
No, not once.

693
01:04:00,136 --> 01:04:02,696
You sure?

694
01:04:06,108 --> 01:04:07,598
He may not be waiting.

695
01:04:10,379 --> 01:04:15,715
For you and only you

696
01:04:15,918 --> 01:04:18,546
I want to live again

697
01:04:18,721 --> 01:04:21,383
Love is life

698
01:04:21,591 --> 01:04:26,995
I give myself all to you

699
01:04:27,196 --> 01:04:29,926
I want to live

700
01:04:30,099 --> 01:04:32,795
Love is life

701
01:04:33,369 --> 01:04:38,932
To hear your voice again

702
01:04:39,141 --> 01:04:44,841
I've kept my heart alive

703
01:04:45,147 --> 01:04:51,450
So say to me, dear Welcome home

704
01:04:51,654 --> 01:04:53,679
Love is life

705
01:05:19,248 --> 01:05:20,442
I'm back.

706
01:05:24,387 --> 01:05:29,017
Matsuko, age 34, 1982

707
01:05:29,225 --> 01:05:32,251
Every little girl...

708
01:05:32,528 --> 01:05:36,589
dreams of being Snow White, Cinderella...

709
01:05:37,333 --> 01:05:40,734
of living in a fairytale.

710
01:05:43,205 --> 01:05:46,436
Then we wake up one day...

711
01:05:46,909 --> 01:05:49,605
and see our white swan...

712
01:05:50,413 --> 01:05:54,247
has become a black crow.

713
01:05:56,252 --> 01:05:58,482
One life...

714
01:05:58,688 --> 01:06:02,215
is all we get.

715
01:06:02,792 --> 01:06:08,230
If it's a fairytale... it's a cruel one.

716
01:06:12,335 --> 01:06:14,326
You listening?

717
01:06:19,842 --> 01:06:21,503
Anyway...

718
01:06:21,744 --> 01:06:26,113
we met again
at a beauty salon in the Ginza.

719
01:06:26,382 --> 01:06:29,840
Wow, what are the odds of that?

720
01:06:30,619 --> 01:06:35,420
It was the salon's name.

721
01:06:36,525 --> 01:06:39,653
The beauty salon in the Ginza...

722
01:06:40,062 --> 01:06:44,863
had the same name
as the salon in prison.

723
01:06:54,543 --> 01:06:56,204
Still don't know?

724
01:06:56,379 --> 01:06:57,846
It's me!

725
01:07:00,583 --> 01:07:02,380
Megumi?

726
01:07:02,651 --> 01:07:05,211
I'm married now... Megumi Sawamura.

727
01:07:05,421 --> 01:07:07,355
No way!

728
01:07:08,858 --> 01:07:12,294
To a man. Don't worry.

729
01:07:13,462 --> 01:07:15,157
Really!

730
01:07:15,364 --> 01:07:18,060
We hung out a lot.

731
01:07:18,701 --> 01:07:20,828
Talked a lot.
