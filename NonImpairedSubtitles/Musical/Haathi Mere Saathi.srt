1
00:02:02,098 --> 00:02:04,089
Excuse me...
Please stop.

2
00:02:05,134 --> 00:02:07,125
Did you see a child on the way?

3
00:02:07,303 --> 00:02:09,237
No, what's the matter?

4
00:02:09,705 --> 00:02:11,696
No, it's nothing.

5
00:02:15,044 --> 00:02:17,035
Where has Raju gone?

6
00:02:17,580 --> 00:02:18,569
Oh God!

7
00:02:22,118 --> 00:02:26,248
Lord! For what sins
am l being punished?

8
00:02:27,690 --> 00:02:30,090
My wife died some years ago.

9
00:02:31,060 --> 00:02:33,051
Today l've lost my son!

10
00:02:33,596 --> 00:02:35,587
l'm tired looking for him.

11
00:02:36,599 --> 00:02:39,090
Now l come to You as
the last refuge!

12
00:02:39,735 --> 00:02:41,726
Give me my son!

13
00:02:42,138 --> 00:02:45,596
Wherever he be, protect him!

14
00:04:14,563 --> 00:04:17,054
Master, you have a weak heart.

15
00:04:17,566 --> 00:04:21,058
How will you get better if
you keep worrying about Raju?

16
00:04:21,570 --> 00:04:24,562
You need rest.

17
00:04:26,909 --> 00:04:32,074
Even death won't put me at ease.

18
00:04:34,049 --> 00:04:36,040
l do not fear death.

19
00:04:37,319 --> 00:04:42,586
But l hope l don't die
before seeing my son... !

20
00:04:43,125 --> 00:04:47,755
The search is on for him.
l'm sure he'll be found.

21
00:04:48,764 --> 00:04:53,599
Master! Your son has come!

22
00:04:55,938 --> 00:04:57,929
Raju!
- Father!

23
00:05:03,279 --> 00:05:05,110
My child!

24
00:05:06,015 --> 00:05:08,108
Where were you, my son?

25
00:05:10,886 --> 00:05:12,854
My child!

26
00:05:18,561 --> 00:05:20,222
Where have these
elephants come from?

27
00:05:20,563 --> 00:05:22,155
l have brought them.

28
00:05:22,298 --> 00:05:25,358
l fell into the jungle when we
had the accident, the other day.

29
00:05:25,935 --> 00:05:27,926
A leopard attacked me.

30
00:05:28,270 --> 00:05:30,261
This elephant saved me.

31
00:05:32,241 --> 00:05:36,575
Good Lord!

32
00:05:37,246 --> 00:05:40,579
You are indeed merciful
and abound in generosity!

33
00:05:42,585 --> 00:05:45,577
Son, these are no
ordinary elephants.

34
00:05:47,590 --> 00:05:53,085
Lord Ganesha himself has appeared
in this form to protect you!

35
00:05:53,729 --> 00:05:57,096
Good Lord...
- What do you want?

36
00:05:57,266 --> 00:06:01,100
This is my Lord, Sri Ganesha.

37
00:06:01,270 --> 00:06:03,261
l want to touch their feet!

38
00:06:07,610 --> 00:06:09,544
My Lord... !
- Master!

39
00:06:10,045 --> 00:06:12,536
Father, what's wrong?

40
00:06:22,091 --> 00:06:26,050
Take care of them
when l am no more.

41
00:06:27,229 --> 00:06:31,029
Don't ever leave them.

42
00:06:31,233 --> 00:06:35,067
Never...
- Why do you say this?

43
00:06:36,038 --> 00:06:40,566
l may not get another
chance to speak.

44
00:06:42,011 --> 00:06:43,911
l'm going... .

45
00:06:44,747 --> 00:06:47,739
No, father! l don't have a mother.

46
00:06:48,283 --> 00:06:51,582
Whom do l have but you?

47
00:07:01,597 --> 00:07:04,589
They will be yours...

48
00:07:10,039 --> 00:07:12,030
These elephants will be your mates.

49
00:07:12,708 --> 00:07:14,699
Master.
- Father!

50
00:11:54,156 --> 00:11:56,147
Who is this uncouth man?

51
00:11:57,092 --> 00:11:59,083
Why are you standing?
Go and get the ball.

52
00:11:59,761 --> 00:12:05,131
Go on. Mahesh, Ganesh... come
here. Very good.

53
00:12:45,774 --> 00:12:48,106
Save me!

54
00:12:51,079 --> 00:12:53,946
This elephant is after my life!

55
00:12:54,082 --> 00:12:56,073
l can give you my life.

56
00:12:57,619 --> 00:12:59,610
Stop right there.

57
00:13:00,622 --> 00:13:02,613
Go away from here
if you value your life.

58
00:13:05,227 --> 00:13:08,890
You're very bad! l said,
go away or l'll mince you!

59
00:13:16,304 --> 00:13:19,068
Hey, he's really gone
hearing your voice!

60
00:13:19,241 --> 00:13:24,577
He won't bother you. He knows who
l am. He understood my signals.

61
00:13:24,746 --> 00:13:26,737
Seems to belong to a good family.

62
00:13:39,127 --> 00:13:41,118
l just moved away from you
and he chases me again!

63
00:13:41,263 --> 00:13:45,097
Shall l give you an idea?
Don't go away till he leaves.

64
00:13:45,801 --> 00:13:47,996
You are joking! Ask him to go!

65
00:13:48,136 --> 00:13:51,105
All right. Wild animal!

66
00:13:51,273 --> 00:13:53,138
Go away or l'll shoot you!

67
00:13:56,611 --> 00:13:59,102
Look at him run with
his tail between his legs!

68
00:14:05,120 --> 00:14:07,111
Amazing! You're a magician!

69
00:14:07,789 --> 00:14:11,555
You're just flattering me.
You haven't seen my magic.

70
00:14:11,726 --> 00:14:14,058
Show you a demonstration?
- This is enough.

71
00:14:14,229 --> 00:14:15,560
What are you doing here?

72
00:14:15,730 --> 00:14:19,063
l was going in my car
when a ball fell on me.

73
00:14:19,734 --> 00:14:24,569
When l stepped out to check,
this elephant got after me.

74
00:14:24,673 --> 00:14:25,662
How sad!

75
00:14:25,774 --> 00:14:27,901
Uncouth man!
- Pardon?

76
00:14:29,244 --> 00:14:31,235
May l escort you to the car?

77
00:14:31,580 --> 00:14:36,574
You don't look familiar. A stranger
in these parts... travelling?

78
00:14:37,986 --> 00:14:41,922
Alone, or are you escorted?
- My Daddy is here too

79
00:14:43,091 --> 00:14:46,583
What's so good about that?
- l mean, where do you live?

80
00:14:47,062 --> 00:14:49,587
We have our own bungalow.
- What did you say your name is?

81
00:14:51,967 --> 00:14:54,401
l didn't tell you my name.
- Then tell now.

82
00:14:55,937 --> 00:14:59,600
My name is Tanuja but people
lovingly call me Tanu. Your's.

83
00:14:59,774 --> 00:15:03,266
My name is Rajkumar but
people lovingly call me Raju.

84
00:15:04,112 --> 00:15:05,602
Glad to meet you.

85
00:15:05,780 --> 00:15:08,112
Are you glad?
- Somewhat.

86
00:15:30,238 --> 00:15:32,229
Thanks a ton, my friend.

87
00:15:32,741 --> 00:15:34,572
l have it made.

88
00:15:34,743 --> 00:15:36,734
Did you like the angel?

89
00:15:37,779 --> 00:15:41,078
So you're with me.

90
00:15:58,300 --> 00:16:01,599
Let's go friends,
we had a good game.

91
00:16:18,019 --> 00:16:20,010
Run out of petrol
in the middle of nowhere!

92
00:16:38,039 --> 00:16:40,030
So this is the matter!

93
00:16:44,746 --> 00:16:47,579
Loafer! Uncouth boor!
Climb down!

94
00:16:48,116 --> 00:16:54,578
ls your car not working?
- My brain is not functioning!

95
00:16:54,756 --> 00:16:56,747
Hence l got taken in by your words!

96
00:16:58,059 --> 00:17:00,994
What have l done?
Why... ? What happened?

97
00:17:01,129 --> 00:17:03,757
You've found a good way
of teasing girls!

98
00:17:03,932 --> 00:17:07,595
What did l do?
- Sent your elephant after me!

99
00:17:07,736 --> 00:17:09,931
And then comes by himself
to fight the elephant!

100
00:17:10,071 --> 00:17:13,871
To prove what a hero he is!

101
00:17:14,009 --> 00:17:16,534
Softly! What will people
say when they hear?

102
00:17:17,545 --> 00:17:20,207
l've seen plenty of heroes like you!

103
00:17:20,548 --> 00:17:23,881
Possibly, but you don't
have to push me for that.

104
00:17:24,052 --> 00:17:28,546
l just asked if your car has
a problem and if l could help.

105
00:17:28,890 --> 00:17:30,881
l don't need your help!

106
00:17:31,026 --> 00:17:34,894
Get out of my car!
Go away from here!

107
00:17:40,035 --> 00:17:43,061
Fine, l'll leave.

108
00:17:44,306 --> 00:17:46,570
Let's go friends.

109
00:18:14,035 --> 00:18:15,900
Aren't you a very nice man!

110
00:18:16,037 --> 00:18:19,871
You harass me! And leave me
all alone in these forests!

111
00:18:20,041 --> 00:18:22,942
Talk softly.
- The car's run out of gas.

112
00:18:23,078 --> 00:18:25,069
Tow it to a gas station.
- Never.

113
00:18:25,347 --> 00:18:27,542
You have rewarded me enough
for my service.

114
00:18:27,749 --> 00:18:32,049
You have abused me! So go and
find some people tow it!

115
00:18:32,554 --> 00:18:36,547
l'll pay you for it! 5, 10, 50...
- Even 200 Rupees?

116
00:18:36,891 --> 00:18:39,052
That wouldn't feed even
one of my elephants.

117
00:18:41,029 --> 00:18:42,553
So you're not going help me!
- l will.

118
00:18:42,731 --> 00:18:45,063
But there's a way of seeking help.
- What way?

119
00:18:45,567 --> 00:18:47,558
The way lndian women
seek help.

120
00:18:47,702 --> 00:18:50,034
What's that?
- Stop acting smart.

121
00:18:50,238 --> 00:18:53,571
Fold your hands and request...

122
00:18:53,742 --> 00:18:57,576
Sire, l need help.
We both agree to this.

123
00:18:57,746 --> 00:19:01,580
Else we're off. Good day.

124
00:19:01,916 --> 00:19:05,079
l beg with joined hands...

125
00:19:05,587 --> 00:19:08,078
Please help this helpless woman.

126
00:19:08,256 --> 00:19:14,525
We'll surely help. Come on.

127
00:19:20,869 --> 00:19:22,530
Please sit down.

128
00:19:25,006 --> 00:19:29,534
Get ready to push.
- What? Will they push?

129
00:19:29,711 --> 00:19:31,542
Will the elephants steer
and you want to push?

130
00:19:31,713 --> 00:19:34,546
They will take you as
carefully as fragile glass.

131
00:19:35,917 --> 00:19:37,908
Look at that.

132
00:20:08,082 --> 00:20:10,915
''March on, my friend... ''

133
00:20:11,319 --> 00:20:13,253

163
00:24:15,563 --> 00:24:18,896
''You're the best of friends... ''

164
00:24:19,567 --> 00:24:22,058
''you're so very loyal''

165
00:24:23,571 --> 00:24:26,563
''The world is a falsehood... ''

166
00:24:27,575 --> 00:24:30,066
''but your love is for true''

167
00:24:35,049 --> 00:24:38,075
''You've never been corrupted... ''

168
00:24:39,053 --> 00:24:43,080
''although the world
has changed''

169
00:24:43,591 --> 00:24:46,082
''March on, my friend... ''

170
00:24:46,728 --> 00:24:48,923
''O my elephant... ''

171
00:24:49,097 --> 00:24:52,589
''drag this huge pile of junk... ''

172
00:24:52,934 --> 00:24:55,926
''Give it a push, my friend... ''

173
00:24:56,771 --> 00:25:00,104
''this motorcar has broken down''

174
00:25:00,942 --> 00:25:04,105
''Give it a push, my friend''

175
00:25:35,309 --> 00:25:38,574
Long live Daddy!

176
00:25:39,113 --> 00:25:43,072
Come in dear. Ramprasad,
this is my only child, Tanu.

177
00:25:43,384 --> 00:25:45,579
She's always singing my praise.

178
00:25:47,121 --> 00:25:50,090
Good day.
- This is Ramprasad.

179
00:25:50,591 --> 00:25:54,584
He's very wealthy.
He owns gardens, orchards.

180
00:25:54,796 --> 00:25:59,927
His son is getting married.
- You must bring her along.

181
00:26:00,067 --> 00:26:02,058
Sure, both of us will come.

182
00:26:02,770 --> 00:26:04,761
l'm her shadow.

183
00:26:06,607 --> 00:26:08,598
Good day.
- Good day.

184
00:26:12,213 --> 00:26:13,874
Yes, dear?
- May l ask you something?

185
00:26:14,015 --> 00:26:18,042
Yesterday there was a wedding
here, our gardener's son's.

186
00:26:18,753 --> 00:26:22,052
He came here personally,
and requested you...

187
00:26:22,890 --> 00:26:26,053
But you didn't walk
4 steps for that poor man.

188
00:26:27,261 --> 00:26:31,288
But today you are willing to
go far for this stranger.

189
00:26:34,302 --> 00:26:38,568
Yes, dear. The gardener is our
servant and will always remain so.

190
00:26:39,574 --> 00:26:44,068
But Ramprasad is a rich man.

191
00:26:44,579 --> 00:26:47,571
Today he is my friend.
Tomorrow he could be a relative.

192
00:26:48,249 --> 00:26:52,913
Now you see the difference?
- Yes but l don't like it.

193
00:26:53,254 --> 00:26:56,587
Be ready for the wedding
in the evening.

194
00:26:56,958 --> 00:26:59,927
Yes, l know you haven't got your
full meal but what can l do?

195
00:27:42,570 --> 00:27:48,372
That's all there is.
There's no more.

196
00:27:50,945 --> 00:27:52,936
Why aren't they being fed today?

197
00:27:53,080 --> 00:27:56,572
They are elephants not
babies of birds. Get more food.

198
00:27:59,587 --> 00:28:02,078
What's wrong?
- Where do l get it from?

199
00:28:04,592 --> 00:28:05,581
l cooked and fed them
whatever ration Munim gave me.

200
00:28:08,996 --> 00:28:11,021
Where is he?
- lnside.

201
00:28:14,702 --> 00:28:16,533
Accountant!

202
00:28:16,904 --> 00:28:18,030
Yes?

203
00:28:18,272 --> 00:28:21,036
May l ask why the
elephants aren't being fed well?

204
00:28:21,709 --> 00:28:25,873
Because they can't speak?.
Open the locker and give me money.

205
00:28:26,213 --> 00:28:28,875
Which locker? They are all empty.

206
00:28:32,553 --> 00:28:34,885
Empty? Meaning... ?

207
00:28:35,222 --> 00:28:38,055
Nothing is hidden from you.

208
00:28:39,026 --> 00:28:43,554
Cases are filed against you
for your wealth and property.

209
00:28:44,765 --> 00:28:46,562
There is no income.

210
00:28:46,734 --> 00:28:48,725
And expenses are as usual.

211
00:28:49,303 --> 00:28:53,569
We can't draw anything from
the bank till the court verdict.

212
00:28:54,775 --> 00:28:57,744
What little we had at home
was spent on court expenses.

213
00:28:58,045 --> 00:28:59,979
Or consumed by the elephants!

214
00:29:00,114 --> 00:29:04,574
l'm paying for whatever
ration they are eating now.

215
00:29:04,919 --> 00:29:06,648
Why are you paying for it?

216
00:29:06,854 --> 00:29:10,017
The ones we bought from
have stopped giving credit.

217
00:29:10,524 --> 00:29:14,255
They say we must first clear
old debt, then ask for credit.

218
00:29:14,729 --> 00:29:17,857
Why didn't you go to Jamnadas?
- l did go.

219
00:29:18,666 --> 00:29:20,657
He has refused to give money.

220
00:29:23,137 --> 00:29:26,538
What? Another 50000 rupees?

221
00:29:26,941 --> 00:29:32,038
Mister, l was going to ask you
for repayment of old accounts.

222
00:29:32,546 --> 00:29:37,540
Don't worry. My ancestral
property is worth millions.

223
00:29:37,718 --> 00:29:42,052
But it is under dispute.

224
00:29:42,289 --> 00:29:44,951
And you have only one house.

225
00:29:45,092 --> 00:29:48,084
Against which l've given you
300000

226
00:29:48,562 --> 00:29:50,723
l can't give any more.

227
00:29:51,032 --> 00:29:54,058
l only need 50000.

228
00:29:54,235 --> 00:29:57,898
The verdict will be known by
next month. l'll return your money.

229
00:29:58,105 --> 00:30:00,096
At your rate of interest.

230
00:30:00,574 --> 00:30:02,565
Any rate of interest?
- Yes.

231
00:30:02,910 --> 00:30:07,074
A money lender always dies
at the knife of interest.

232
00:30:07,581 --> 00:30:09,572
You too may kill me.

233
00:30:11,252 --> 00:30:13,243
Please sign here.

234
00:30:24,098 --> 00:30:26,089
Here you are.

235
00:30:29,070 --> 00:30:33,939
Take this money and get
food for the elephants first.

236
00:30:34,809 --> 00:30:39,109
The elephants are alive.
They shouldn't die of hunger.

237
00:30:39,280 --> 00:30:40,611
All right

238
00:30:41,082 --> 00:30:44,609
l've heard there's an
elephant race in our town.

239
00:30:44,785 --> 00:30:47,618
Will your elephants participate?
- What?

240
00:30:48,089 --> 00:30:51,081
lf there's a race here,
won't my elephants participate?

241
00:30:51,959 --> 00:30:53,620
ls that possible?

242
00:30:53,961 --> 00:30:58,625
Everybody pay attention.
The elephant race is about to begin.

243
00:30:59,633 --> 00:31:07,130
Whoever wins the race will be
rewarded with a silver cup.

244
00:31:07,641 --> 00:31:12,578
At the hands of the daughter of
Ratanlal, Bangalore industrialist.

245
00:31:12,980 --> 00:31:18,077
l won't talk to you
if you don't stand first.

246
00:31:18,919 --> 00:31:19,908
Very good!

247
00:31:20,588 --> 00:31:24,581
You are well prepared sir.
Your elephant will beat all hollow.

248
00:31:24,758 --> 00:31:28,592
Why not. He knows if his
master rewards him... .

249
00:31:28,929 --> 00:31:31,261
And also punishes severely.

250
00:33:23,577 --> 00:33:25,568
Well done son! Come on!

251
00:33:33,754 --> 00:33:37,588
The elephant standing first
in this race is called Ramu.

252
00:33:38,125 --> 00:33:44,086
His master, Rajkumar is requested
to come upstage and accept the prize.

253
00:33:46,767 --> 00:33:49,099
l'm Sarwan Kumar, the
owner of Bombay Carnival.

254
00:33:49,336 --> 00:33:52,601
My elephant too took part
but lost to yours.

255
00:33:53,274 --> 00:33:55,606
That's a great animal.
- Thank you.

256
00:34:04,618 --> 00:34:06,609
Dear, give him the cup.

257
00:34:17,564 --> 00:34:19,555
How are you?
- Very well.

258
00:34:20,100 --> 00:34:23,558
My Daddy.
- Do you know him?

259
00:34:23,737 --> 00:34:30,074
l told you when l was stuck without
petrol? His elephants helped me.

260
00:34:33,580 --> 00:34:36,913
You were great today.
- My elephants not me.

261
00:34:37,084 --> 00:34:40,747
Come home some day.
- Sure, l will someday.

262
00:34:51,598 --> 00:34:53,930
The reward for winning
was a silver cup.

263
00:34:55,002 --> 00:34:58,938
At the hands of an angel.
But the reward for losing. .

264
00:35:09,083 --> 00:35:11,074
What have you done?
Killed the elephant!

265
00:35:11,552 --> 00:35:14,214
What about our show?
- You've always be a fool.

266
00:35:14,922 --> 00:35:17,049
An ever better elephant
will come to our carnival.

267
00:35:17,224 --> 00:35:20,557
The one who won the race today.
- You mean, Ramu?

268
00:35:22,096 --> 00:35:27,056
Yes. That is why l shook hands
and congratulated the enemy.

269
00:35:27,568 --> 00:35:29,559
But will Rajkumar sell him?

270
00:35:30,771 --> 00:35:36,073
He won't but his accountant
will force him to sell.

271
00:35:41,014 --> 00:35:43,574
Good day.
- Good day. Come in.

272
00:35:44,585 --> 00:35:46,576
l was waiting for you.

273
00:35:46,920 --> 00:35:48,911
Please be seated.
- Doesn't matter.

274
00:35:49,256 --> 00:35:53,590
What's the matter?
- Something very urgent.

275
00:35:53,761 --> 00:35:58,095
l want to buy the elephant
that won today's race.

276
00:35:58,932 --> 00:36:00,923
And only you can help me in this.

277
00:36:02,269 --> 00:36:06,763
No sir, you can't get him at
any price. He is my master's life.

278
00:36:07,107 --> 00:36:10,042
You may assume that l am
asking for your master's life.

279
00:36:10,544 --> 00:36:12,535
What would it be worth?

280
00:36:12,746 --> 00:36:15,874
What can l say?
lt's very difficult.

281
00:36:16,216 --> 00:36:20,050
l'll make it simple.
Here are 2000 rupees.

282
00:36:20,754 --> 00:36:24,713
And when you get me the elephant,
l'll give you another 5000.

283
00:36:26,093 --> 00:36:28,891
This isn't the cost of the
elephant but for your efforts.

284
00:36:29,563 --> 00:36:32,555
The reward for just one elephant?
- Yes.

285
00:36:32,733 --> 00:36:34,724
lf you think this is less,
l'll pay you 10,000.

286
00:36:35,569 --> 00:36:37,560
10,000... ?
- Yes.

287
00:36:37,771 --> 00:36:40,103
ln which case, l'll try and get you
all the four elephants!

288
00:36:40,307 --> 00:36:43,071
Now, that's something...
very well said.

289
00:36:46,046 --> 00:36:48,071
Ever since, they have become
a part of my life.

290
00:36:49,049 --> 00:36:51,916
As if their favours weren't enough,
they did me another one.

291
00:36:52,085 --> 00:36:54,076
What's that?
- They made me meet you...

292
00:36:54,254 --> 00:36:56,916
and got you to give me a prize.
A silver cup.

293
00:36:57,591 --> 00:37:01,083
Did you ever win prizes as a student
or were you always a duffer... ?

294
00:37:02,596 --> 00:37:04,587
You won't believe me, if l told you.
- Tell me.

295
00:37:06,133 --> 00:37:08,260
l'll believe you.
- You will? So listen.

296
00:37:08,602 --> 00:37:11,036
For 3 years l stood first in
the school running race!

297
00:37:11,205 --> 00:37:13,537
Cock and bull!
- No, it's true!

298
00:37:17,211 --> 00:37:21,045
l would have given you a
cup of tea if not of silver.

299
00:37:22,082 --> 00:37:24,550
All lies!
- How?

300
00:37:25,018 --> 00:37:30,547
How old were you then?
- Then... ? About this high. .

301
00:37:31,091 --> 00:37:34,891
You were a little boy
this high in half pants.

302
00:37:35,062 --> 00:37:38,054
Yes, l was round and fat.

303
00:37:38,565 --> 00:37:40,556
Yet l'd have beaten you.

304
00:37:40,901 --> 00:37:43,563
Want to bet?
- Yes.

305
00:37:44,905 --> 00:37:52,573
What's the reward?
- Reward... if you win...

306
00:37:53,714 --> 00:37:55,705
lf you win, you can marry me.

307
00:37:55,949 --> 00:37:57,940
And if l win, l'll marry you.

308
00:38:01,088 --> 00:38:05,752
Marriage? Marriage?

309
00:38:07,995 --> 00:38:09,189
Accept?

310
00:38:37,558 --> 00:38:39,549
''The train moves... ''

311
00:38:43,730 --> 00:38:49,566
''Like the heart beats,
dhak, dhak, dhak... ''

312
00:38:50,037 --> 00:38:53,063
''Kal, kal, kal... ''

313
00:38:53,373 --> 00:38:58,572
''like the rivers flow
chal, chal... ''

314
00:38:59,580 --> 00:39:02,572
''There's excitement in my heart''

315
00:39:09,222 --> 00:39:14,854
''Your bangles tinkle,
chhan-chhan''

316
00:39:15,062 --> 00:39:20,125
''My heart and soul
sway in my love for you''

317
00:39:21,268 --> 00:39:24,863
''Listen, listen... ''

318
00:39:25,105 --> 00:39:30,543
''my anklets chime,
chhun-chhun... ''

319
00:39:30,877 --> 00:39:34,540
''and l sing the melody of love''

320
00:40:02,242 --> 00:40:07,578
''My elephants dance,
rumm, rumm... ''

321
00:40:08,281 --> 00:40:11,910
''Let me go,
my ear-ring is lost''

322
00:40:12,085 --> 00:40:15,077
''Find it for me.
- Me?''

323
00:40:15,756 --> 00:40:18,088
''Yes, you, you you''

324
00:40:26,400 --> 00:40:29,597
''Chhup chhup... ''

325
00:40:30,137 --> 00:40:33,595
''Chup chup... ''

326
00:40:33,807 --> 00:40:38,107
''come, let's sway quietly... ''

327
00:40:39,613 --> 00:40:43,606
''let's share our
joys and sorrows''

328
00:40:45,852 --> 00:40:54,624
''Our hearts skip a beat,
my love, my love... ''

329
00:40:55,362 --> 00:40:59,128
''When l'm with you,
what do you grieve?''

330
00:41:15,082 --> 00:41:20,076
''Do not love anyone else
in the world''

331
00:41:20,287 --> 00:41:23,916
''l feel so shy''

332
00:41:31,898 --> 00:41:35,095
''Let me go...
- How can l let you go?''

333
00:41:35,268 --> 00:41:39,602
''Let me go... ''

334
00:42:17,577 --> 00:42:21,570
Excuse me sir...
l love your daughter!

335
00:42:21,748 --> 00:42:25,582
That is no sin. l want to
marry her and that's no crime!

336
00:42:27,053 --> 00:42:29,920
You're probably thinking
l'm too blunt for words.

337
00:42:30,090 --> 00:42:35,926
But if you tear open my heart,
you'll know l'm also heartless.

338
00:42:36,129 --> 00:42:39,587
Tell me if you accept this match.

339
00:42:40,600 --> 00:42:42,932
How was it?

340
00:42:43,737 --> 00:42:46,604
Just start off like this
in front of the man.

341
00:42:46,740 --> 00:42:48,605
And he will give his daughter's
hand to you.

342
00:42:48,742 --> 00:42:52,940
And he will say, My children,
God bless both of you.

343
00:42:54,614 --> 00:42:56,605
Very good.

344
00:43:24,778 --> 00:43:26,575
Yes. Go on Mr. Lawyer.

345
00:43:27,581 --> 00:43:29,572
Why are you troubling me?

346
00:43:30,083 --> 00:43:31,914
Pardon?
- l wasn't talking to you.

347
00:43:33,086 --> 00:43:37,580
l called to remind you today
is the last hearing of your case.

348
00:43:37,757 --> 00:43:39,918
l hope you're coming to court.
- No way.

349
00:43:40,126 --> 00:43:42,959
l have to go to another court.
- Another court?

350
00:43:43,129 --> 00:43:46,098
Yes, much greater than your court.

351
00:43:46,600 --> 00:43:50,092
And the decision of my
life will be taken there.

352
00:43:52,272 --> 00:43:56,606
Anyway, tell your accountant
he must come as a witness.

353
00:43:56,943 --> 00:44:00,106
Our case hinges on his testimony.

354
00:44:00,380 --> 00:44:04,282
Sure, l'll send him.
Good day. Accountant!

355
00:44:04,618 --> 00:44:08,884
l've heard everything.
Don't worry, l'm off to court.

356
00:44:09,222 --> 00:44:11,884
Thanks.
- No need for thanks.

357
00:44:12,058 --> 00:44:15,050
lt's my duty.
- Son...

358
00:44:15,896 --> 00:44:19,059
What were you saying on the
telephone? Life, decision. . ?

359
00:44:19,566 --> 00:44:25,061
Be patient. When l return you'll
be floored by the good news.

360
00:44:36,316 --> 00:44:37,578
You've come!

361
00:44:37,717 --> 00:44:40,584
Yes, call your Daddy. Where is he?
- Okay.

362
00:44:43,590 --> 00:44:46,081
What's the matter?
- Rajkumar is here.

363
00:44:46,593 --> 00:44:48,925
Ask him to sit, l'm coming.

364
00:44:49,129 --> 00:44:52,929
Please take a seat.
- Do you have a mirror?

365
00:44:53,133 --> 00:44:56,102
Mirror? - Mirror!
- For what? - Rehearsal.

366
00:45:03,276 --> 00:45:06,268
Sir, l love your daughter. . 
- Welcome.

367
00:45:07,614 --> 00:45:11,050
lt's our privilege that you
came to our house. Take a seat.

368
00:45:12,018 --> 00:45:15,215
Tanu said you wanted to talk to me.

369
00:45:15,889 --> 00:45:17,550
Sit down.

370
00:45:19,225 --> 00:45:21,557
Yes, so what is it?

371
00:45:23,296 --> 00:45:25,560
Actually. .

372
00:45:31,304 --> 00:45:34,137
Why are you perspiring in this cold?

373
00:45:34,307 --> 00:45:37,071
No... no sweat...

374
00:45:38,078 --> 00:45:41,912
That's because he drives
the car very fast.

375
00:45:43,049 --> 00:45:45,916
But he's panting as if
he ran all the way.

376
00:45:46,586 --> 00:45:50,078
That's his way of driving. The
car on the road and him in the car!

377
00:45:54,594 --> 00:45:57,586
May l drink a glass of water?
- Yes, go ahead.

378
00:46:03,970 --> 00:46:05,961
Now tell me what's the matter?

379
00:46:09,009 --> 00:46:10,704
Can l have another glass?

380
00:46:10,877 --> 00:46:14,040
You've come from so far,
have a cup of coffee or tea.

381
00:46:14,214 --> 00:46:17,547
That can be done later.
May l ask you something personal?

382
00:46:17,717 --> 00:46:21,050
Yes, ask!
- Did you speak for your own marriage?

383
00:46:21,855 --> 00:46:24,221
What do you mean?
- Did you speak for yourself?.

384
00:46:24,557 --> 00:46:27,549
What about me...
The day l decided...

385
00:46:27,727 --> 00:46:29,718
l landed up at my in-law's home.

386
00:46:29,896 --> 00:46:34,060
And told him, l love your daughter.

387
00:46:34,300 --> 00:46:38,236
And that's no crime!
l want to marry her.

388
00:46:38,938 --> 00:46:40,565
And that's no sin!

389
00:46:40,740 --> 00:46:43,573
Then l roared like a lion.

390
00:46:43,743 --> 00:46:48,077
Will you marry your
daughter to me or not?

391
00:46:48,815 --> 00:46:50,908
What did he say?
- What could he say?

392
00:46:51,117 --> 00:46:55,577
He sat quiet for awhile.
Then said, yes l will.

393
00:46:55,922 --> 00:46:57,913
l too want to say the same.

394
00:46:58,091 --> 00:47:00,787
l love your daughter and
want to marry her. Yes or no?

395
00:47:08,034 --> 00:47:12,027
Terrific! l tried fooling you
and you fooled me!

396
00:47:12,205 --> 00:47:14,867
My state was the same as yours
today.

397
00:47:15,708 --> 00:47:19,542
l understood your story
the day of the race.

398
00:47:20,547 --> 00:47:22,879
l knew all along!

399
00:47:23,083 --> 00:47:25,881
l appreciate that.

400
00:47:26,052 --> 00:47:28,885
Appreciate my knowledge too.

401
00:47:29,022 --> 00:47:32,549
l've inquired that you too
belong to a wealthy family.

402
00:47:33,026 --> 00:47:37,554
And of equal status.
l wanted such a groom for my child.

403
00:47:39,099 --> 00:47:41,090
So you approve?
- Answer us Daddy.

404
00:47:42,102 --> 00:47:45,560
When the couple agree. . 
- What can the others do?

405
00:47:50,043 --> 00:47:52,568
l said l'd give you some
good news on my return.

406
00:47:52,745 --> 00:47:56,237
Have a sweet.
- First the news.

407
00:47:56,683 --> 00:48:02,588
You always said this house
is huge, very beautiful.

408
00:48:02,722 --> 00:48:04,121
Right?
- Yes.

409
00:48:04,257 --> 00:48:07,590
So l've chosen a girl
and l'm marrying her!

410
00:48:07,794 --> 00:48:11,025
But who is the girl?
How is she?

411
00:48:14,534 --> 00:48:17,526
She's like a sweetmeat. Fair
and sweet. Have a bite.

412
00:48:19,005 --> 00:48:20,529
Come in.

413
00:48:20,673 --> 00:48:22,538
Have a bite.

414
00:48:30,216 --> 00:48:32,207
We've lost the case.

415
00:48:39,058 --> 00:48:42,050
l've lost everything.

416
00:48:44,063 --> 00:48:46,054
That's how family feud is.

417
00:48:46,232 --> 00:48:48,894
Empires are lost and rulers ousted.

418
00:48:49,302 --> 00:48:52,567
l am sorry l could not
save your property.

419
00:48:53,106 --> 00:48:57,099
Your accountant had been bought
and we lost a winning game.

420
00:49:01,080 --> 00:49:03,913
Son, what has happened?

421
00:49:05,919 --> 00:49:08,080
God! ls this a game?

422
00:49:09,055 --> 00:49:12,183
You give joys with one hand and
snatch it away with the other!

423
00:49:16,529 --> 00:49:19,862
Rajkumar lost the case
thanks to my false testimony!

424
00:49:21,000 --> 00:49:24,026
Now he has no money.

425
00:49:24,270 --> 00:49:28,866
To pay off his debts. Now the
moneylender will use pressure.

426
00:49:29,209 --> 00:49:33,543
And he'll have to sell his elephants!

427
00:49:34,214 --> 00:49:40,881
This is akin to lightning striking
in one place but razing another.

428
00:49:41,087 --> 00:49:44,056
You've lost the case
but l have been ruined!

429
00:49:44,757 --> 00:49:47,885
l stand alive before you.

430
00:49:48,094 --> 00:49:54,556
l don't deny that l owe you
But l need a little time.

431
00:49:55,235 --> 00:49:59,069
That's the one thing a
money lender doesn't possess.

432
00:49:59,305 --> 00:50:01,899
And what will you do with time?

433
00:50:02,108 --> 00:50:04,975
You've lost everything with this
case.

434
00:50:05,111 --> 00:50:06,908
Nothing is lost.

435
00:50:09,048 --> 00:50:13,075
You. . ?
- Yes, l've heard everything.

436
00:50:13,286 --> 00:50:16,585
l want to help you.
These are 150000 rupees.

437
00:50:21,928 --> 00:50:24,089
What is this money for?
- For your elephants.

438
00:50:27,200 --> 00:50:28,189
Meaning?

439
00:50:28,334 --> 00:50:29,096
l wondered how you
could support them in this state.

440
00:50:29,269 --> 00:50:33,262
l'll buy them off.

441
00:50:34,841 --> 00:50:38,106
Sell them?
- Listen to me.

442
00:50:39,012 --> 00:50:41,947
Don't lose this golden opportunity.

443
00:50:42,115 --> 00:50:45,607
God Himself has come to help you.

444
00:50:45,985 --> 00:50:50,979
Give that money to me. l'll
give you extra time for the rest.

445
00:51:01,634 --> 00:51:03,625
Go and take it.

446
00:51:17,917 --> 00:51:19,908
Take your money and go away.

447
00:51:21,054 --> 00:51:23,579
What are you watching?
- You're very ungrateful.

448
00:51:23,923 --> 00:51:25,914
l extend a hand of friendship
and you reject it!

449
00:51:31,597 --> 00:51:35,089
You are out of your mind!
You kicked away 150000 rupees!

450
00:51:35,735 --> 00:51:39,603
You won't find another madman
to pay you 150000 for these animals!

451
00:51:39,739 --> 00:51:41,604
l say, shut up!

452
00:51:45,611 --> 00:51:49,945
They maybe animals for you but
they mean more than humans to me!

453
00:51:51,084 --> 00:51:55,612
They are my childhood mates,
my friends, my brothers.

454
00:51:56,756 --> 00:51:59,281
l can sell myself for them
but never will l sell them.

455
00:52:00,159 --> 00:52:05,290
Be warned next time you say this,
you'll pay for the consequences.

456
00:52:06,799 --> 00:52:11,566
lt is rightly said a losing gambler
and a spoilt rich brat are lethal.

457
00:52:11,738 --> 00:52:14,070
You too may leave.

458
00:52:14,307 --> 00:52:20,576
Yes but be warned, l'll bring
a vacation order from court.

459
00:52:21,581 --> 00:52:26,575
Just as you're throwing me out some
day l'll do the same to you forever!

460
00:52:31,057 --> 00:52:32,081
Listen...

461
00:52:39,265 --> 00:52:41,256
There's no need for
you to go to court.

462
00:52:42,602 --> 00:52:44,593
This house is now yours.

463
00:52:48,074 --> 00:52:50,065
Here are the keys.

464
00:52:55,415 --> 00:52:57,280
Are you crying?

465
00:52:58,084 --> 00:53:01,611
Seeing the way one
human treats another?

466
00:53:02,989 --> 00:53:08,120
The two legged man is the
most dangerous animal of all.

467
00:53:09,729 --> 00:53:13,062
Neither is this your place nor mine.

468
00:53:14,934 --> 00:53:17,061
All right, l must take leave.

469
00:53:17,570 --> 00:53:19,561
l too will accompany you.

470
00:53:20,239 --> 00:53:22,901
You have children, a family.

471
00:53:23,743 --> 00:53:25,904
Where will you wander with me?

472
00:53:26,746 --> 00:53:31,581
Do me a favour.
Find yourself a good job.

473
00:53:33,319 --> 00:53:36,083
All right son.
Just as you wish.

474
00:53:36,589 --> 00:53:38,580
l don't want to be a burden on you.

475
00:53:49,101 --> 00:53:52,093
Did you hear about what happened
to the elephant owner Rajkumar?

476
00:53:53,406 --> 00:53:56,273
What?
- He had taken a loan from Jamnadas.

477
00:53:57,009 --> 00:53:59,000
Today Jamnadas took his house
away.

478
00:54:00,146 --> 00:54:02,614
He and his elephants were thrown
out.

479
00:54:03,282 --> 00:54:05,614
These days kings can't
maintain elephants.

480
00:54:06,085 --> 00:54:08,076
What big deal was he?

481
00:54:30,042 --> 00:54:31,066
Stop.

482
00:54:36,249 --> 00:54:38,080
Where are you going?

483
00:54:38,918 --> 00:54:43,582
To talk to Tanu.
- What's left to say?

484
00:54:45,925 --> 00:54:47,916
Everything is out in the open.

485
00:54:48,261 --> 00:54:50,593
l don't want to hide
anything from you.

486
00:54:51,931 --> 00:54:53,922
What do you have to offer Tanu?

487
00:54:54,133 --> 00:54:57,102
Not wealth, not property.
Nor home nor status.

488
00:54:59,138 --> 00:55:02,107
You will spend your life
under the open sky.

489
00:55:02,808 --> 00:55:06,608
ln lanes, market places.
But my daughter can't do it.

490
00:55:07,213 --> 00:55:09,044
l came to say this to her.

491
00:55:09,549 --> 00:55:12,712
She must forget me.

492
00:55:14,687 --> 00:55:18,020
She will forget you. You
needn't meet or tell her this.

493
00:55:19,091 --> 00:55:24,552
l'm her father. l can't deliberately
plunge her into trouble.

494
00:55:25,765 --> 00:55:27,892
Neither for my own sake...
nor for your love.

495
00:55:29,068 --> 00:55:32,060
Very well. l will go away.
But do tell Tanu...

496
00:55:32,772 --> 00:55:34,763
l was here to meet her,
before l left.

497
00:55:36,108 --> 00:55:37,700
Good bye.

498
00:55:38,244 --> 00:55:39,575
Let's go.

499
00:55:57,363 --> 00:55:59,160
Where are going?
- To meet Raju.

500
00:55:59,298 --> 00:56:03,098
Listen!
Raju won't meet you.

501
00:56:06,205 --> 00:56:08,105
Why? What happened?

502
00:56:09,208 --> 00:56:11,039
We've been deceived.

503
00:56:12,912 --> 00:56:16,712
Raju sold his house and
left the city life a thief.

504
00:56:17,883 --> 00:56:20,044
He has left? But for where?

505
00:56:21,053 --> 00:56:28,050
He has gone to Bombay. To marry
mill owner Chandanmal's daughter.

506
00:56:29,228 --> 00:56:33,062
No, this can't be true!

507
00:56:33,899 --> 00:56:35,890
He can't leave me!

508
00:56:36,035 --> 00:56:38,026
He promised to marry me!

509
00:56:38,904 --> 00:56:41,566
A promise to marry means nothing
compared to a storm of riches.

510
00:56:43,109 --> 00:56:46,078
Raju knew l was wealthy.

511
00:56:46,579 --> 00:56:49,571
But unlike Chandanmal l can't
give mills as part of dowry.

512
00:56:50,916 --> 00:56:56,081
He has turned you down and gone,
it's best you too forget him.

513
00:56:56,589 --> 00:56:59,581
No! l can't do this!

514
00:57:00,593 --> 00:57:06,759
Don't shed tears for a man
who doesn't value these pearls.

515
00:57:06,966 --> 00:57:09,526
l know you can't
live here anymore.

516
00:57:10,069 --> 00:57:15,029
His memories will torment you.
We'll leave this place tomorrow.

517
00:58:50,970 --> 00:58:52,961
How did these elephants come here?
Whom do they belong to?

518
00:58:53,572 --> 00:58:55,904
They are mine.

519
00:58:56,075 --> 00:58:57,906
But what are they doing here?

520
00:58:58,077 --> 00:59:01,069
Unless l find some place for
them, where can l leave them?

521
00:59:01,580 --> 00:59:03,571
This is an office,
not a circus tent!

522
00:59:03,716 --> 00:59:07,914
Leave them elsewhere if
you wish to work here.

523
00:59:08,087 --> 00:59:11,022
Can't maintain himself and
wants to keep animals!

524
00:59:11,190 --> 00:59:15,524
Fire me if you wish
but don't malign them.

525
00:59:16,061 --> 00:59:18,052
They maybe dark skinned
but clean hearted.

526
00:59:18,197 --> 00:59:20,188
More decent than you and me.

527
00:59:20,533 --> 00:59:23,195
Serving others yet
acting as a prince.

528
00:59:23,536 --> 00:59:27,529
You're not doing me a favour.
You've employed me as l work.

529
00:59:28,707 --> 00:59:30,538
You're fired!

530
00:59:55,234 --> 00:59:56,963
Who are you? What do you want?

531
00:59:57,102 --> 01:00:02,062
l want a place to stay.
- Sorry, no rooms available.

532
01:00:02,241 --> 01:00:05,574
l'll lie out here.
- Fine.

533
01:00:07,246 --> 01:00:08,577
Friends.

534
01:00:26,062 --> 01:00:28,587
From where have these elephants
come? - They are my mates.

535
01:00:28,798 --> 01:00:35,101
That's all fine but this inn
has been built for human beings.

536
01:00:35,271 --> 01:00:37,262
Not animals. Please go away.

537
01:00:37,607 --> 01:00:40,098
Where can l go in this rain?
l'll leave in the morning.

538
01:00:41,010 --> 01:00:45,140
lt's a question of my job.
Please leave now.

539
01:00:52,154 --> 01:00:54,122
Thank God, you made this world.

540
01:00:54,790 --> 01:00:58,624
Had man made it, he would
have created no place for animals!

541
01:01:45,007 --> 01:01:47,942
Friends, this is God's home.

542
01:01:48,744 --> 01:01:50,735
Nobody can throw us out of here.

543
01:02:14,937 --> 01:02:17,929
Listen put this stuff in that car.

544
01:02:41,263 --> 01:02:43,925
Kept the stuff?.
- Yes sir. That man is taking it.

545
01:02:47,069 --> 01:02:50,061
ln whose hand have you given it?
Looks like he's drunk early morning!

546
01:03:05,287 --> 01:03:06,948
What has happened to you?

547
01:03:07,623 --> 01:03:10,558
Daddy, this is Raju!
- Don't create a scene in the market.

548
01:03:12,928 --> 01:03:15,055
Let's go, driver!

549
01:03:34,583 --> 01:03:37,575
Raju is in this state!
You lied to me!

550
01:03:37,753 --> 01:03:40,085
He's gone to Bombay to
marry some wealthy girl!

551
01:03:40,723 --> 01:03:44,260
Why did you lie to me?
Answer me Daddy! Why?

552
01:03:44,260 --> 01:03:48,594
Yes, l lied to you.

553
01:03:49,131 --> 01:03:51,122
But only for your welfare.

554
01:03:51,600 --> 01:03:55,934
l had found out that Raju
had lost his home and wealth.

555
01:03:56,605 --> 01:03:59,096
He had no option but to
wander from pillar to post.

556
01:03:59,942 --> 01:04:06,609
l did not wish my darling
daughter to wander with him.

557
01:04:07,082 --> 01:04:08,947
This was very wrong.

558
01:04:09,084 --> 01:04:11,552
You sacrificed my love for yours.

559
01:04:12,788 --> 01:04:16,053
l could have shared his
sorrow if not given him relief.

560
01:04:16,892 --> 01:04:18,257
l'm going to him!

561
01:04:18,561 --> 01:04:21,052
Wait Tanu.
l won't let you go.

562
01:04:22,031 --> 01:04:25,558
l won't tolerate my child
plunging into fire before my eyes.

563
01:04:25,734 --> 01:04:28,567
You won't tolerate my going!
And l can't stay here!

564
01:04:30,039 --> 01:04:35,568
You don't know...
cars, bungalows...

565
01:04:35,911 --> 01:04:38,903
... have no value in a woman's eyes.

566
01:04:40,115 --> 01:04:42,106
She only wants a good husband.

567
01:04:42,585 --> 01:04:46,077
Who will give her love and
in whose feet her world lays.

568
01:04:46,655 --> 01:04:49,590
l have seen poverty, you haven't.

569
01:04:50,759 --> 01:04:53,592
You wouldn't speak in this
way if you had been poor.

570
01:04:53,996 --> 01:04:56,931
l think you must forget him.
- No, Daddy!

571
01:04:57,099 --> 01:04:59,932
l can't live without him!

572
01:05:00,069 --> 01:05:02,094
You have to forget him
and live without him!

573
01:06:19,548 --> 01:06:22,540
Hey, elephant! What are you doing?

574
01:06:22,685 --> 01:06:27,554
Let go! Leave me!

575
01:06:31,293 --> 01:06:33,284
Where are you taking me?

576
01:06:35,931 --> 01:06:38,058
You brought me to a sick man!
Why don't you tell first?

577
01:06:39,702 --> 01:06:43,570
Holy smoke! His body is fiery
hot! l'll have to give a shot.

578
01:07:02,591 --> 01:07:04,582
These elephants brought me here.
Are they yours?

579
01:07:07,596 --> 01:07:10,861
l came out after a visit
and he dragged me here.

580
01:07:12,534 --> 01:07:14,900
You're running high fever.
l'll admit you to a hospital.

581
01:07:18,540 --> 01:07:20,531
l can't go there.

582
01:07:22,011 --> 01:07:25,538
lf l go there, who
will look after them?

583
01:07:27,249 --> 01:07:29,217
l can't go.

584
01:07:29,551 --> 01:07:32,543
That will be terrible.
All right...

585
01:07:32,721 --> 01:07:37,556
l'll give you some pills.
Take these thrice a day.

586
01:07:43,565 --> 01:07:45,897
Your fees...
- To hell with it!

587
01:07:46,101 --> 01:07:48,729
Why do you worry? Just rest.

588
01:07:49,238 --> 01:07:51,069
l am leaving.

589
01:07:55,577 --> 01:07:59,069
Why do you cry son?
l did what l could.

590
01:07:59,581 --> 01:08:04,075
Your master will soon
be well. Trust God.

591
01:09:00,109 --> 01:09:02,077
What is it?

592
01:09:08,684 --> 01:09:10,515
Brought it from the temple?

593
01:09:13,322 --> 01:09:15,847
You went to the temple
to pray for me?

594
01:09:17,059 --> 01:09:23,191
l can never repay you for your love!
Never!

595
01:09:28,704 --> 01:09:32,697
Kids, watch this game of a
monkey and throw some money.

596
01:09:33,075 --> 01:09:37,876
See these players
like a pair of twins.

597
01:09:38,046 --> 01:09:39,877
Children clap for them.

598
01:09:42,551 --> 01:09:44,542
They will salute you!

599
01:09:44,653 --> 01:09:47,554
Climb up and salute all!

600
01:10:06,575 --> 01:10:09,066
Your mother is unwell.
Get some water.

601
01:10:09,244 --> 01:10:13,908
Listen to me, dear son.
Get some water.

602
01:10:14,082 --> 01:10:20,078
All right, get it for your wife.
Look at him, working for the wife!

603
01:10:20,255 --> 01:10:23,088
Didn't bring it for the mother.
- Hen pecked husband!

604
01:10:26,261 --> 01:10:31,198
Now see how they get
possessed by ghosts!

605
01:10:31,600 --> 01:10:33,591
Let go, spirits!

606
01:10:35,070 --> 01:10:41,771
Let go your demons!
Abracadabra!

607
01:11:01,630 --> 01:11:03,962
Go my child, and set them
on your shoulder.

608
01:11:04,132 --> 01:11:09,900
Get some money for the
upkeep of the monkeys.

609
01:11:13,575 --> 01:11:17,067
They danced so well for you!

610
01:11:40,802 --> 01:11:45,102
Crowd thinning here.
But building there.

611
01:11:45,274 --> 01:11:47,606
Let's go and see who
this enemy of ours is.

612
01:11:56,952 --> 01:11:58,943
Now for another trick.

613
01:12:18,907 --> 01:12:21,899
How're we going to compete
with those elephants?

614
01:12:22,110 --> 01:12:24,078
Shut up! And come with me!

615
01:12:25,747 --> 01:12:28,580
Go the betel-shop. l'll come there.
- Where are you going?

616
01:12:28,717 --> 01:12:29,741
To hell!

617
01:12:30,786 --> 01:12:33,584
Wow! We've made 250 Rupees.

618
01:12:33,855 --> 01:12:36,585
We're going to have a feast
you friends will always remember.

619
01:13:49,097 --> 01:13:51,588
What's going on?
Where did this elephant come from?

620
01:13:51,767 --> 01:13:54,600
He's dragging me. . 
- Something must be wrong.

621
01:13:54,770 --> 01:13:56,931
Handle the traffic.
l'll look after the animal.

622
01:14:00,609 --> 01:14:02,600
Take this and go home.
l will back afterwards.

623
01:14:15,023 --> 01:14:16,888
Thief! Rascal! Where is my money?

624
01:14:17,025 --> 01:14:18,890
l don't have any money.

625
01:14:24,232 --> 01:14:26,894
Hey, what's going on!

626
01:14:28,570 --> 01:14:30,902
l am a poor monkey trainer.

627
01:14:31,106 --> 01:14:33,904
He started an elephant show
and ruined mine.

628
01:14:34,042 --> 01:14:36,067
And now he set these
elephants on my tail!

629
01:14:36,244 --> 01:14:38,576
Arrest him.
- He's a thief and a liar!

630
01:14:38,914 --> 01:14:41,906
The elephants are chasing him
because he stole my money.

631
01:14:42,117 --> 01:14:44,585
Ha! Search me.

632
01:14:44,786 --> 01:14:47,755
No need for that.
Here is the money.

633
01:14:48,056 --> 01:14:54,256
He gave the money to me when the
elephants chased him. Take it.

634
01:14:55,063 --> 01:14:57,930
You rascal. . !
- Constable, take him away.

635
01:14:58,300 --> 01:15:00,268
Here your's money.

636
01:15:00,936 --> 01:15:02,927
Your elephants are very smart.

637
01:15:03,605 --> 01:15:05,596
Thank you.
- That's all right.

638
01:15:06,775 --> 01:15:07,935
Well done, boys.

639
01:15:08,109 --> 01:15:12,205
Give me a reward for
getting a thief caught.

640
01:15:12,547 --> 01:15:17,541
Here, take this.
- l didn't do this for money.

641
01:15:18,553 --> 01:15:21,545
Give me some little job.
- Want job?

642
01:15:21,823 --> 01:15:24,553
Earlier l made monkeys dance.
Now l'll make elephants dance.

643
01:15:24,893 --> 01:15:26,554
As well as massage you.

644
01:15:26,695 --> 01:15:28,560
What do you say pals?

645
01:15:32,033 --> 01:15:34,024
All right.
- Good.

646
01:15:38,573 --> 01:15:40,234
That's it.

647
01:15:54,589 --> 01:15:55,578
Dear...

648
01:16:06,268 --> 01:16:09,863
You've given your decision.
Hear mine now.

649
01:16:10,205 --> 01:16:13,868
l am going. Don't look for me.

650
01:16:14,209 --> 01:16:16,074
Neither must you follow me.

651
01:16:16,211 --> 01:16:20,045
Know one thing, you can imprison
me.

652
01:16:21,082 --> 01:16:26,042
You can bind my body in ropes
but not chain my heart.

653
01:16:27,556 --> 01:16:29,547
Your daughter, Tanu.

654
01:16:54,616 --> 01:16:58,074
Forgive me. l no longer have the
right to call you by your name.

655
01:16:58,753 --> 01:17:02,587
Why do you say that?
- l've lost all that l had.

656
01:17:04,025 --> 01:17:10,021
l show tricks on the road. Every
penny people throw at me is precious.

657
01:17:10,999 --> 01:17:15,026
But your father can still
weigh you out in gold.

658
01:17:16,204 --> 01:17:17,535
There's no comparison between the
two.

659
01:17:18,540 --> 01:17:20,531
Don't punish me for what Daddy did.

660
01:17:21,876 --> 01:17:24,868
He told me you had ditched me.

661
01:17:25,780 --> 01:17:28,044
And you're married into a rich
family.

662
01:17:29,017 --> 01:17:31,008
You're getting factories in dowry.

663
01:17:32,887 --> 01:17:34,548
Do you see my factory?

664
01:17:34,689 --> 01:17:40,559
lt's great! The best mill owner
won't have such a fantastic factory!

665
01:17:40,795 --> 01:17:42,888
Don't poke fun at me.

666
01:17:43,264 --> 01:17:48,566
l found out the truth only
when l saw you on the road.

667
01:17:49,904 --> 01:17:55,570
That's when l realised my Daddy
had deceived me not you.

668
01:17:56,945 --> 01:17:58,936
Since then l had only
one thing in mind.

669
01:17:59,914 --> 01:18:02,576
That l meet and apologise to you.

670
01:18:03,652 --> 01:18:07,088
But how could l come?
l was imprisoned at home.

671
01:18:08,590 --> 01:18:10,524
But today l escaped from home.

672
01:18:10,992 --> 01:18:13,187
l found you here after
searching all day long.

673
01:18:13,795 --> 01:18:15,854
But what's the gain in searching.

674
01:18:16,998 --> 01:18:18,863
What do l have to offer you?

675
01:18:19,034 --> 01:18:21,025
Neither wealth nor home,
nor status nor property.

676
01:18:22,270 --> 01:18:24,534
All day l'm on the roads
with my elephants.

677
01:18:25,040 --> 01:18:28,032
l return when it's dark
to sleep in these ruins.

678
01:18:29,711 --> 01:18:32,043
This gypsy life is not for you!

679
01:18:32,580 --> 01:18:37,040
l accept this life but
not going back to that Hell!

680
01:18:37,886 --> 01:18:41,549
l won't leave you and go.
- l can't keep you with me!

681
01:18:41,823 --> 01:18:46,886
Why?
- You see the state l'm in?

682
01:18:47,562 --> 01:18:51,555
And look at these ruins.
What will people say?

683
01:18:51,966 --> 01:18:57,063
That l'm purposely ensnaring you
to grab your wealth someday.

684
01:18:58,006 --> 01:19:01,066
Tell me what l must do!

685
01:19:01,576 --> 01:19:04,568
My hands are broken.

686
01:19:04,746 --> 01:19:10,013
l'll move heaven and earth
and try to be worthy of you.

687
01:19:10,852 --> 01:19:15,846
When that happens, l'll
ask your Daddy for your hand.

688
01:19:16,057 --> 01:19:18,048
Not before that or without that.

689
01:19:19,194 --> 01:19:21,856
For now, you must leave.

690
01:19:23,198 --> 01:19:26,861
ls this your last decision?
- My last decision and the right one.

691
01:19:28,002 --> 01:19:30,869
lt's best that you return
home just as you'd come.

692
01:19:31,973 --> 01:19:36,535
l've left my home far behind.

693
01:19:37,545 --> 01:19:41,037
You are not aware of what
decisions are being taken for me.

694
01:19:42,550 --> 01:19:45,041
Daddy wants to forcibly
marry me elsewhere.

695
01:19:45,887 --> 01:19:47,912
l ran away and came to you!

696
01:19:49,023 --> 01:19:53,892
lf you also reject me,
there's only one option for me.

697
01:19:55,063 --> 01:19:57,054
To put an end to my life!

698
01:20:02,570 --> 01:20:05,903
Forgive me, l had no idea
matters were beyond control.

699
01:20:06,741 --> 01:20:10,575
lf you love me so much,
l'll fight the world for you.

700
01:20:11,846 --> 01:20:13,905
But l won't let you down.

701
01:20:22,590 --> 01:20:25,923
Come on in. Tanu,
he's my assistant.

702
01:20:26,094 --> 01:20:30,087
Who is this lady?
- Tell you later. First let's eat.

703
01:20:30,265 --> 01:20:34,759
l bought enough for two.
l didn't know about guests.

704
01:20:34,936 --> 01:20:38,099
Guests stay for just a day.

705
01:20:38,606 --> 01:20:42,098
But she won't go anywhere.

706
01:20:42,277 --> 01:20:44,609
Got it! She's your wife!

707
01:20:45,146 --> 01:20:48,604
Going to be.
- l'll get special eats for her.

708
01:20:48,883 --> 01:20:51,943
No. We'll split what there is.

709
01:20:52,287 --> 01:20:55,950
She has started budget
soon as she entered.

710
01:20:56,124 --> 01:20:59,616
Do you know the problem with us?
- What is it?

711
01:20:59,828 --> 01:21:02,626
Two people eat what three should.

712
01:21:02,797 --> 01:21:05,129
And one eats what
- Two should eat!

713
01:21:05,366 --> 01:21:08,631
Lecture on arrival?
But l like it, what do you say?

714
01:21:08,770 --> 01:21:09,759
Right.

715
01:21:09,904 --> 01:21:13,897
Hearing this, l feel
women should permanently rule us!

716
01:22:14,903 --> 01:22:22,036
''Gentlemen! Friends...
watch the fun!''

717
01:23:02,884 --> 01:23:05,114
''Work, if you want to live''

718
01:23:05,353 --> 01:23:08,117
''Salute everyone around
in respect''

719
01:23:08,289 --> 01:23:10,883
''Else, this world won't let you live''

720
01:23:11,092 --> 01:23:13,560
''lt won't feed you,
you'll go thirsty''

721
01:23:14,062 --> 01:23:16,895
''Give them something new
everyday''

722
01:23:19,734 --> 01:23:22,066
''Work, if you want to live''

723
01:23:22,303 --> 01:23:25,067
''Salute everyone around
in respect''

724
01:23:25,573 --> 01:23:27,905
''Else, this world won't let you live''

725
01:23:28,042 --> 01:23:30,909
''lt won't feed you,
you'll go thirsty''

726
01:24:13,788 --> 01:24:16,552
''Without money, you get no bread''

727
01:24:16,691 --> 01:24:19,057
''You get no clothes''

728
01:24:19,594 --> 01:24:22,563
''Do not spoil your name''

729
01:24:25,299 --> 01:24:27,893
''Salute everyone around
in respect''

730
01:24:28,069 --> 01:24:30,560
''Work, if you want to live''

731
01:25:08,142 --> 01:25:10,702
''Our dreams, we shall
realise some day''

732
01:25:10,878 --> 01:25:13,540
''Say something, my boy... ''

733
01:25:13,948 --> 01:25:17,042
''that leaves everyone
clutching at their hearts''

734
01:25:19,720 --> 01:25:25,056
''Salute everyone in respect.
Work, if you wish to live''

735
01:25:48,749 --> 01:25:50,580
''Say your prayers''

736
01:26:08,069 --> 01:26:10,537
''Like a mare pulling
a horse-carriage... ''

737
01:26:10,872 --> 01:26:13,534
''she darts across the tight rope''

738
01:26:13,741 --> 01:26:16,733
''Let's go home.
Say good-bye to everyone''

739
01:26:19,280 --> 01:26:24,547
''Work, if you wish to live.
Respect everyone''

740
01:26:24,952 --> 01:26:27,546
''Else, this world won't let you live''

741
01:26:27,822 --> 01:26:30,552
''lt won't feed you,
you'll go thirsty''

742
01:26:30,925 --> 01:26:33,553
''Give them something
new everyday''

743
01:27:40,425 --> 01:27:44,953
This is a cheetah!
lt's called a leopard!

744
01:27:45,296 --> 01:27:49,130
A wild cat... it's
very intelligent.

745
01:27:49,300 --> 01:27:54,636
Look at this goat...
- lt ain't a goat. lt's a male.

746
01:27:55,807 --> 01:28:00,141
C'mon... let's move.
There's so much more to see.

747
01:28:04,649 --> 01:28:08,141
Do you know what this is?
lt's a kind of creature.

748
01:28:08,319 --> 01:28:14,315
lt's called a hedgehog.
These are its' guards, thorns.

749
01:28:14,659 --> 01:28:19,153
This is what it will do
if somebody attacks it.

750
01:28:26,637 --> 01:28:30,596
Why are you screaming your lungs
out?

751
01:28:32,143 --> 01:28:34,611
Forget the style and
clean this place up.

752
01:28:34,779 --> 01:28:37,942
That's what l do all day!

753
01:28:38,149 --> 01:28:41,118
So leave that braid
and hold the broom. Go!

754
01:28:41,619 --> 01:28:43,610
Going! l'm going!

755
01:28:46,624 --> 01:28:48,615
These are lions.

756
01:28:49,961 --> 01:28:55,126
The king of the forest.
And children, these are elephants.

757
01:28:55,633 --> 01:28:59,626
A reincarnation of
Lord Ganesha. Bow to them.

758
01:29:01,005 --> 01:29:02,973
And this is a crocodile.

759
01:29:03,140 --> 01:29:05,973
He's powerful in water
like the lion on land.

760
01:29:09,981 --> 01:29:10,970
What is it?

761
01:29:11,115 --> 01:29:12,980
Why is he looking
listless? Didn't you feed him?

762
01:29:13,651 --> 01:29:17,314
l did but this pigeon ate it.

763
01:29:17,655 --> 01:29:19,646
Shouldn't you give him more?
- Yes.

764
01:29:20,324 --> 01:29:23,987
Your job is feeding him. Get it fast!
- Yes sir.

765
01:29:24,662 --> 01:29:27,256
Calls me sire, and rubs
his hand on my cheek!

766
01:29:27,598 --> 01:29:30,590
Come along kids.

767
01:29:31,269 --> 01:29:35,262
This is a sloth bear.
Walks on hind legs like man.

768
01:29:35,773 --> 01:29:40,107
Why is he so dirty?
- God made him dark.

769
01:29:40,278 --> 01:29:42,940
So he doesn't feel cold.

770
01:29:43,281 --> 01:29:44,942
Like we wear sweaters.

771
01:29:45,082 --> 01:29:47,607
How are you kids?
- Hello.

772
01:29:49,620 --> 01:29:52,612
Finished seeing this place?
- Yes, it is great.

773
01:29:52,790 --> 01:29:57,124
We'll come again.
- Not bunking school.

774
01:30:02,800 --> 01:30:04,961
You've done a great deed by
bringing animals to the city.

775
01:30:06,304 --> 01:30:08,295
The children are
blooming like flowers.

776
01:30:09,173 --> 01:30:12,631
l wish to ask you something
in the capacity of a journalist.

777
01:30:12,810 --> 01:30:15,973
Yes go on.
- Why do you love animals so much?

778
01:30:17,381 --> 01:30:19,372
There's a long story behind it.

779
01:30:20,084 --> 01:30:22,075
l owe my success to them.

780
01:30:22,753 --> 01:30:26,917
l never considered them animals,
they were always my mates.

781
01:30:27,758 --> 01:30:30,591
l belong to them as
they belong to me.

782
01:30:31,095 --> 01:30:35,589
Setting a world of love
must have cost a lot of money.

783
01:30:35,933 --> 01:30:40,597
l had to take loans but
l did this only so that. .

784
01:30:41,138 --> 01:30:45,131
l want to prove to the world
through this world of love...

785
01:30:45,943 --> 01:30:49,106
Man can stay in
harmony with animals.

786
01:30:49,947 --> 01:30:51,938
So why can't men live with each
other?

787
01:30:53,017 --> 01:30:57,954
Men fight over casts,
language, religion.

788
01:30:58,155 --> 01:31:00,953
And wants to kill other men. Why?

789
01:31:01,359 --> 01:31:04,624
Very good. l'll write
all this in my newspaper.

790
01:31:04,962 --> 01:31:07,157
And print it with pictures.

791
01:31:07,798 --> 01:31:09,789
Thanks.
- Good day.

792
01:31:28,753 --> 01:31:32,587
What are you watching?
- You and your world of love.

793
01:31:33,124 --> 01:31:36,582
You've personally done everything
here

794
01:31:37,962 --> 01:31:41,591
You faced many difficulties,
obstacles rose in your path.

795
01:31:41,932 --> 01:31:45,595
But you didn't hold back.
Kept marching ahead.

796
01:31:46,070 --> 01:31:48,061
And reached your destination.

797
01:31:49,840 --> 01:31:53,936
l couldn't have made it so far
had you not been with me.

798
01:31:54,812 --> 01:31:57,110
You are equally
responsible for my success.

799
01:31:58,149 --> 01:32:00,617
l want you to be a part of my life.

800
01:32:02,420 --> 01:32:05,617
l'll meet your father
tomorrow and say to him...

801
01:32:06,090 --> 01:32:08,081
l want to marry your daughter.

802
01:32:23,074 --> 01:32:26,043
Daddy... ?
- Yes son.

803
01:32:27,578 --> 01:32:30,570
l've come to see both of you.
- That's very nice. .

804
01:32:32,383 --> 01:32:34,248
Tanu daddy is here!

805
01:32:34,985 --> 01:32:38,580
Why are you quiet?
- Poor girl is probably thinking. .

806
01:32:39,056 --> 01:32:41,047
How to greet an unwanted guest.

807
01:32:41,959 --> 01:32:44,757
Sit or leave.
- No, Daddy.

808
01:32:48,265 --> 01:32:52,099
We are fortunate that
you came to our house.

809
01:32:53,270 --> 01:32:57,104
l wanted to come earlier
but whenever l decided...

810
01:32:58,142 --> 01:33:00,610
My false pride bound
my feet in chains.

811
01:33:01,612 --> 01:33:06,606
And l never made it. But today
my loneliness convinced me.

812
01:33:07,284 --> 01:33:09,616
Become a great man
before a rich man.

813
01:33:12,623 --> 01:33:14,614
l am the father of a daughter.

814
01:33:15,659 --> 01:33:18,127
You are truly magnanimous.

815
01:33:18,796 --> 01:33:26,066
Else l was to come to you to ask
if l'm worthy of your daughter.

816
01:33:27,571 --> 01:33:31,735
l thought you had married her
without inviting this old father.

817
01:33:32,009 --> 01:33:37,914
Tanu and l had decided if we get
married it will be with your blessing

818
01:33:38,115 --> 01:33:39,912
And wish.

819
01:33:41,719 --> 01:33:43,710
My wish has no meaning here.

820
01:33:44,755 --> 01:33:48,589
You are asking for your right
not my daughter's hand.

821
01:33:50,261 --> 01:33:53,094
l'll get you married
in pomp in splendour.

822
01:34:30,568 --> 01:34:33,560
Eat, these snacks have specially
been ordered from Benaras.

823
01:34:36,907 --> 01:34:40,104
He doesn't have a sweet.
- Here.

824
01:34:48,252 --> 01:34:49,913
What are you thinking of?.

825
01:34:50,054 --> 01:34:53,581
Your father's guests
are already dining.

826
01:34:53,924 --> 01:34:56,916
My mates must be waiting.
Shall we go to them?

827
01:34:59,597 --> 01:35:02,122
Get food for all our friends.

828
01:35:07,605 --> 01:35:09,596
You've been invited for the
wedding!

829
01:35:12,610 --> 01:35:15,943
Come fast, everyone is waiting!

830
01:36:38,095 --> 01:36:39,562
Good boy.

831
01:36:53,077 --> 01:36:55,068
Come on Johnny.

832
01:37:06,256 --> 01:37:08,918
Sit in your places.
l'll get the elephants.

833
01:37:11,095 --> 01:37:14,587
Come in Ramu, Ganesh, Mahesh.

834
01:37:16,100 --> 01:37:17,590
That way.

835
01:37:21,071 --> 01:37:23,062
Friends, mates...

836
01:37:23,807 --> 01:37:26,605
This is my father-in-law,
Mr. Ratanlal.

837
01:37:31,982 --> 01:37:33,973
Today's feast is from his side.

838
01:37:34,118 --> 01:37:38,953
Don't feel shy. Eat well.
Such opportunities are rare.

839
01:37:42,126 --> 01:37:43,957
Serve the food.

840
01:38:07,718 --> 01:38:09,652
Eat, why are you angry?

841
01:38:16,393 --> 01:38:18,327
Good boy.

842
01:39:20,991 --> 01:39:24,154
When l've brought the moon home
to banish the darkness of my life. .

843
01:39:25,662 --> 01:39:27,596
Then why do l need lights?

844
01:39:32,069 --> 01:39:34,060
What's the matter?
- That was Ramu.

845
01:39:34,938 --> 01:39:36,929
Something is wrong. l must go.

846
01:39:38,308 --> 01:39:42,938
At this hour? Why must you go?

847
01:39:43,147 --> 01:39:46,605
Servants can look after them.
- They are mere servants.

848
01:39:46,950 --> 01:39:50,613
For them Ramu is just an animal.
He means more than my life to me.

849
01:39:51,622 --> 01:39:53,613
And l mean nothing to you?

850
01:39:54,625 --> 01:39:56,957
You... you are everything...

851
01:39:59,163 --> 01:40:01,131
l'll be back very soon.

852
01:40:10,974 --> 01:40:13,636
What's wrong with him?
- Suddenly took sick.

853
01:40:26,256 --> 01:40:30,955
What's wrong son?
- Must have eaten too much.

854
01:40:31,895 --> 01:40:33,590
Call the doctor.

855
01:40:35,065 --> 01:40:36,930
What's the matter my friend?

856
01:40:45,809 --> 01:40:47,777
Can't diagnose his problem.

857
01:40:48,745 --> 01:40:53,114
Elders have rightly said,
children and animals are the same.

858
01:40:53,617 --> 01:40:57,610
They can't tell what's wrong.
- You are right

859
01:41:17,107 --> 01:41:18,631
What's that?

860
01:41:19,977 --> 01:41:23,140
Nail. . ? There's a nail in his foot!

861
01:41:26,583 --> 01:41:29,916
Dig a mountain...
- To find a mouse!

862
01:41:39,596 --> 01:41:42,588
Now you'll be fine. The
doctor has removed the nail.

863
01:41:43,934 --> 01:41:46,596
l apologise for troubling you.

864
01:41:46,770 --> 01:41:49,102
That is my duty. Good bye.

865
01:41:54,144 --> 01:41:55,202
What a day!

866
01:41:55,345 --> 01:42:00,612
Struggled all night. Only in the
morning we found a nail in his foot.

867
01:42:00,784 --> 01:42:02,775
He was in pain all night.

868
01:42:03,086 --> 01:42:05,077
Do you know how l spent the night?

869
01:42:09,059 --> 01:42:11,960
You tell me how could l leave him?

870
01:42:12,663 --> 01:42:14,631
You could leave me alone.

871
01:42:18,635 --> 01:42:27,065
lt is said the nuptial night is a
union of two bodies, minds and lives.

872
01:42:29,079 --> 01:42:30,239
But...

873
01:42:36,853 --> 01:42:37,251
Don't cry.

874
01:42:37,587 --> 01:42:42,923
l've been punished. We're
stepping into a new life together.

875
01:42:43,927 --> 01:42:47,590
And we should step into it
with a smile not tears.

876
01:42:48,765 --> 01:42:52,929
We'll go somewhere far today.

877
01:42:53,770 --> 01:42:56,603
Where there will be nobody but us.

878
01:42:57,941 --> 01:43:01,104
Only silent mountains, cool winds.

879
01:43:01,945 --> 01:43:03,776
Dark clouds...

880
01:43:06,416 --> 01:43:12,082
Now smile... Come on.

881
01:43:28,739 --> 01:43:32,072
''Listen to us, O cool breeze''

882
01:43:32,576 --> 01:43:36,068
''Wait a while, O dark cloud''

883
01:43:36,713 --> 01:43:40,080
''Listen to us, O cool breeze''

884
01:43:40,317 --> 01:43:44,583
''Wait a while, O dark cloud''

885
01:43:44,921 --> 01:43:48,584
''We talk of love... ''

886
01:43:48,725 --> 01:43:52,252
''listen to our sweet-nothings
before you leave''

887
01:43:52,729 --> 01:43:55,596
''Listen to us, O cool breeze''

888
01:43:56,600 --> 01:43:59,592
''Wait a while, O dark cloud''

889
01:44:00,070 --> 01:44:03,597
''We talk of love... ''

890
01:44:04,274 --> 01:44:07,937
''listen to our sweet-nothings
before you leave''

891
01:44:42,879 --> 01:44:46,576
''The two of us are
on our own tonight... ''

892
01:44:46,750 --> 01:44:50,584
''don't you squeal about it''

893
01:44:54,057 --> 01:44:57,925
''Should l drift into sleep
in my beloved's arms... ''

894
01:44:58,094 --> 01:45:00,085
''do not wake me up all my life''

895
01:45:16,346 --> 01:45:19,281
''Slowly and steadily... ''

896
01:45:20,784 --> 01:45:28,054
''our hearts speak of love...
come, listen to it''

897
01:45:28,225 --> 01:45:31,558
''Listen to us, O cool breeze''

898
01:45:32,062 --> 01:45:35,554
''Wait a while, O dark cloud''

899
01:45:59,055 --> 01:46:06,086
''Remember, you are not to tell
anyone else about what we say to each other''

900
01:46:06,663 --> 01:46:13,262
''Our eyes refuse to sleep tonight.
Our hearts are restless''

901
01:46:13,670 --> 01:46:16,935
''Slowly, on the sly... ''

902
01:46:18,008 --> 01:46:25,608
''that which we say to each other,
come... listen to it''

903
01:46:25,882 --> 01:46:28,874
''Listen to us, O cool breeze''

904
01:46:29,219 --> 01:46:32,552
''Wait a while, O dark cloud''

905
01:46:33,290 --> 01:46:36,726
''We talk of love... ''

906
01:46:37,027 --> 01:46:40,554
''listen to our sweet-nothings
before you leave''

907
01:46:56,313 --> 01:46:58,247
You've killed me!

908
01:47:03,320 --> 01:47:07,586
lf you clean this place all day
when will you enter my heart?

909
01:47:09,259 --> 01:47:11,921
This is a good opportunity.
That little kid has gone out.

910
01:47:12,262 --> 01:47:14,253
Throw this broom and hold my hand.

911
01:47:14,698 --> 01:47:16,928
Let's talk of love.

912
01:47:18,134 --> 01:47:22,093
You've left your work and
are trying to ensnare a girl!

913
01:47:22,339 --> 01:47:27,606
No, l was teaching her
how to clean the house.

914
01:47:27,844 --> 01:47:29,937
Get lost! Teaching me!

915
01:47:30,614 --> 01:47:33,947
What are you standing here for?
l've just cleaned the place.

916
01:47:34,117 --> 01:47:37,109
My boss pays you for it!
Get on with it!

917
01:47:37,287 --> 01:47:40,950
Get lost! The young and old...
they're all rascals!

918
01:47:42,158 --> 01:47:44,285
What a girl...
she's so hot-tempered!

919
01:49:58,294 --> 01:50:00,626
So the carnival was a hit
on the first day in Bangalore.

920
01:50:02,098 --> 01:50:03,963
Sort out the notes.

921
01:50:18,648 --> 01:50:20,639
Have you slept?

922
01:50:22,385 --> 01:50:24,319
l was thinking.

923
01:50:28,591 --> 01:50:32,083
Do you know we haven't
stepped out for a week?.

924
01:50:33,830 --> 01:50:35,923
What do we have to do outside?

925
01:50:36,733 --> 01:50:40,601
The beauty of the world has
shrunk into this room.

926
01:50:41,271 --> 01:50:43,603
l want to spend the
rest of my life like this.

927
01:50:44,607 --> 01:50:50,603
My head resting in your lap
and your tresses covering my face.

928
01:50:53,950 --> 01:50:55,941
l too desire the same.

929
01:50:56,786 --> 01:50:58,777
Life is actually nothing.

930
01:50:59,355 --> 01:51:03,621
But a woman and a man
together, transform it.

931
01:51:04,828 --> 01:51:09,629
The only thing missing is a girl.

932
01:51:10,300 --> 01:51:15,135
You're very greedy. You've
got me and want another.

933
01:51:15,805 --> 01:51:20,970
This is my birthright.

934
01:51:22,111 --> 01:51:24,136
l want two kids not one.

935
01:51:25,114 --> 01:51:29,574
Two?
- One like me and one like you.

936
01:51:29,786 --> 01:51:32,584
Sweet, chubby, cute.

937
01:51:43,066 --> 01:51:44,931
Telegram, sir.

938
01:51:49,973 --> 01:51:51,941
Who is it from?

939
01:51:53,943 --> 01:51:56,935
What's wrong?
- lt's from Chotu.

940
01:51:58,081 --> 01:52:01,608
Says, come immediately or
world of love will be ruined.

941
01:52:03,152 --> 01:52:04,813
What could have gone wrong?

942
01:52:05,154 --> 01:52:07,622
The carnival is the villain.

943
01:52:07,957 --> 01:52:11,017
Thanks to it, people
don't come here anymore.

944
01:52:11,194 --> 01:52:14,129
That is why l sent you that cable.

945
01:52:14,297 --> 01:52:18,131
What can we do to draw
the public back here?

946
01:52:19,035 --> 01:52:22,630
lt's not so easy to get them back.

947
01:52:22,805 --> 01:52:25,137
You don't know what goes on there.

948
01:52:25,642 --> 01:52:28,577
Gambling, dirty dancing by girls.

949
01:52:29,045 --> 01:52:34,950
l will shut down this place but
there won't be gambling or dancing.

950
01:52:36,019 --> 01:52:38,078
You have high ideals.

951
01:52:38,888 --> 01:52:42,585
But the truth is man wants
new excitement every day.

952
01:52:42,759 --> 01:52:46,251
He finds new ways to
spend his evenings.

953
01:52:46,763 --> 01:52:52,099
Your method is old. ln order
to bring the crowds back here. .

954
01:52:52,635 --> 01:52:54,933
You have to think of a new game.

955
01:53:02,612 --> 01:53:04,603
Sir...

956
01:53:04,781 --> 01:53:07,773
Who is on the door?
- l am Raju. l want to meet you.

957
01:53:09,118 --> 01:53:14,988
Who is Raju? l don't know
any Raju. Go away from here!

958
01:53:17,060 --> 01:53:20,621
The journalist Sharma sent me to
you

959
01:53:20,964 --> 01:53:25,628
l see. The door is open. Come in.

960
01:53:31,140 --> 01:53:33,904
Good day sir.
- What's the matter?

961
01:53:34,978 --> 01:53:36,969
l've come to ask you for something.

962
01:53:37,113 --> 01:53:43,074
From me? What can a poor
handicapped man offer anyone?

963
01:53:45,755 --> 01:53:47,746
l want you to be my teacher.

964
01:53:48,591 --> 01:53:52,083
l want you to teach me to set your
clothes on fire and jump into water.

965
01:53:53,062 --> 01:53:55,053
Which used to drive people crazy.

966
01:53:56,766 --> 01:53:58,757
Even l would go crazy.

967
01:54:00,269 --> 01:54:02,931
Their applause and appreciation
is so intoxicating...

968
01:54:03,272 --> 01:54:05,103
More than any liquor.

969
01:54:05,975 --> 01:54:10,605
When a man sets his clothes afire
and plunges into the water...

970
01:54:11,080 --> 01:54:14,607
People applaud and ask him
to jump from higher.

971
01:54:14,784 --> 01:54:16,615
He jumps higher.

972
01:54:19,288 --> 01:54:21,279
Then higher and higher.

973
01:54:22,792 --> 01:54:25,625
But when he falls from
the peak of renown...

974
01:54:27,096 --> 01:54:29,564
Do you know what the outcome is?

975
01:54:33,903 --> 01:54:35,564
See this!

976
01:54:41,310 --> 01:54:45,576
That time people praised me,
appreciate me.

977
01:54:47,250 --> 01:54:52,085
But today l doubt if my bier
fill find four shoulders.

978
01:54:53,056 --> 01:55:00,087
This game is very dangerous.
You'll get what l got.

979
01:55:00,930 --> 01:55:04,093
lnfamy, destruction!

980
01:55:04,600 --> 01:55:07,433
And these crutches
to carry your corpse!

981
01:55:12,608 --> 01:55:14,599
l accept this too.

982
01:55:15,611 --> 01:55:17,943
Do you love fame and
wealth so much?

983
01:55:20,783 --> 01:55:22,944
l neither love fame nor wealth.

984
01:55:23,286 --> 01:55:26,915
But l love some lives
more than my own.

985
01:55:27,890 --> 01:55:29,881
l want to do this for them.

986
01:55:31,561 --> 01:55:34,553
l beg you to accept me
as your disciple.

987
01:55:39,235 --> 01:55:42,227
Your resolve has weakened
my resistance.

988
01:55:43,239 --> 01:55:47,073
l will impart this knowledge to you.

989
01:55:51,280 --> 01:55:54,579
Yes Daddy. l don't
understand what to do.

990
01:55:55,051 --> 01:55:59,579
He neither listens to me nor
others. Will you talk to him?

991
01:55:59,755 --> 01:56:02,246
He might listen to you.
- Don't worry.

992
01:56:03,126 --> 01:56:05,094
l'll come and meet him tomorrow.

993
01:56:22,612 --> 01:56:25,103
Walk carefully dear!

994
01:56:26,048 --> 01:56:29,540
You shouldn't walk so
swiftly in this condition.

995
01:56:31,087 --> 01:56:35,547
l hadn't seen Raju for days.
Thought l'd meet him.

996
01:56:35,725 --> 01:56:37,716
Please have a seat.

997
01:56:48,004 --> 01:56:51,906
l'll get tea for you.
- Go slowly dear, don't run.

998
01:56:54,577 --> 01:56:58,570
My daughter is innocent and silly.
Take care of her.

999
01:56:58,948 --> 01:57:02,748
l do what is possible.
- l'm sure.

1000
01:57:06,055 --> 01:57:07,079
Yes?

1001
01:57:10,593 --> 01:57:12,584
Yes?
- l want your advice.

1002
01:57:13,196 --> 01:57:19,601
From me?
- Yes, l got a statement from my bank.

1003
01:57:19,936 --> 01:57:23,929
l found l had too much extra cash.

1004
01:57:24,807 --> 01:57:27,935
l thought to myself what's the
point of keeping this in the bank?.

1005
01:57:28,144 --> 01:57:33,605
Why not invest it in business
that would help me and another.

1006
01:57:34,784 --> 01:57:37,617
What do you say?
- What can l tell you?

1007
01:57:38,154 --> 01:57:42,113
You are familiar with the real
world. l only know my world of love.

1008
01:57:42,825 --> 01:57:46,955
Why don't l invest in
your world of love?

1009
01:57:47,296 --> 01:57:50,163
Your efforts and my money.
We'll be partners.

1010
01:57:51,634 --> 01:57:54,000
Daddy is right.

1011
01:57:58,307 --> 01:58:00,969
But these days my world
of love is running losses.

1012
01:58:01,377 --> 01:58:03,311
You might lose your money.

1013
01:58:03,646 --> 01:58:05,807
Every business has profits and
losses.

1014
01:58:06,315 --> 01:58:09,148
What man considers gold turns to
dust.

1015
01:58:09,318 --> 01:58:13,152
lt's also possible that your
world of love which is in loss. .

1016
01:58:13,823 --> 01:58:17,156
... can start earning profits.
What amount shall l fill in?

1017
01:58:32,775 --> 01:58:34,766
How much money are
you getting for me?

1018
01:58:37,146 --> 01:58:40,604
You asked Daddy to come
here and talk to me.

1019
01:58:41,284 --> 01:58:44,776
Give me money. So that l
don't play that dangerous game.

1020
01:58:46,289 --> 01:58:48,120
lsn't it?

1021
01:58:51,027 --> 01:58:54,963
l consider life a war.

1022
01:58:55,631 --> 01:59:00,125
Where man has to fight for his
principles, his way of life.

1023
01:59:00,803 --> 01:59:06,639
Only your own power and strength
and courage help you in this.

1024
01:59:07,810 --> 01:59:12,645
Those who fire from the
shoulders of others are cowards!

1025
01:59:14,650 --> 01:59:17,983
lf you want to give me
something, ask Daddy to bless me.

1026
01:59:23,192 --> 01:59:25,183
My blessings are always with you.

1027
01:59:26,595 --> 01:59:31,931
l am glad today l saw
a real man within you.

1028
01:59:33,135 --> 01:59:35,126
May God grant you success.

1029
01:59:37,606 --> 01:59:41,098
May God grant you success.
- May God grant you success.

1030
01:59:46,115 --> 01:59:47,946
God bless you

1031
02:02:16,966 --> 02:02:18,957
What's wrong?

1032
02:02:29,912 --> 02:02:31,937
Congratulations, you
are blessed with a son.

1033
02:02:33,949 --> 02:02:35,940
Are the mother and baby fine?
- Yes.

1034
02:02:36,752 --> 02:02:39,585
But...
- But... ?

1035
02:02:40,189 --> 02:02:43,249
We had to operate because
the case was complicated.

1036
02:02:43,759 --> 02:02:45,750
She can't have another baby.

1037
02:02:50,966 --> 02:02:55,960
Don't worry. The country's slogan
now is, small family, happy family.

1038
02:02:57,773 --> 02:02:59,604
Can we meet her?
- Sure

1039
02:03:04,980 --> 02:03:07,972
He's so sweet!
- Just like you!

1040
02:03:10,286 --> 02:03:12,277
How are you, dear?

1041
02:03:12,788 --> 02:03:13,948
Fine.

1042
02:03:27,570 --> 02:03:32,906
Congratulations. Your son
is as beautiful as you.

1043
02:03:35,110 --> 02:03:37,237
Are you crying?
What's wrong?

1044
02:03:41,083 --> 02:03:43,074
Didn't the doctor tell you?

1045
02:03:44,119 --> 02:03:47,111
l can't give you a
pretty little doll.

1046
02:03:48,757 --> 02:03:50,588
Why is that making you cry?

1047
02:03:50,726 --> 02:03:55,595
A thousand stars can't give
the light one sun can.

1048
02:03:56,065 --> 02:04:02,061
Sun. The good Lord has
sent a little sun to us.

1049
02:04:02,271 --> 02:04:04,262
So why do we need a moon?

1050
02:04:05,341 --> 02:04:10,108
l've even named him,
Suraj. Like it?

1051
02:04:14,783 --> 02:04:19,618
Listen everyone!
Good news for all!

1052
02:04:19,855 --> 02:04:21,948
There's a new guest
in our world of love!

1053
02:04:22,958 --> 02:04:25,290
Your brother and my son, Suraj!

1054
02:04:46,749 --> 02:04:48,910
Everywhere you turn only
Raju is being discussed!

1055
02:04:49,084 --> 02:04:52,747
He has ruined our carnival!
Nobody comes here at all!

1056
02:04:53,255 --> 02:04:55,917
We'll have to wind up
if matters continue so.

1057
02:04:56,959 --> 02:05:00,918
lt makes sense to leave the
filed when you can't win.

1058
02:05:01,096 --> 02:05:04,930
Shut up! You don't know me!

1059
02:05:05,100 --> 02:05:12,097
Even if l lose all my wealth,
l'll evict Raju from here!

1060
02:05:12,608 --> 02:05:13,597
Understand?

1061
02:06:14,069 --> 02:06:16,264
Let him sleep, Come on!

1062
02:06:16,972 --> 02:06:18,963
l will sleep with my son,
Yes Raju!

1063
02:06:19,942 --> 02:06:23,105
Okay then, sleep with your son.
l am going.

1064
02:07:15,764 --> 02:07:18,927
''O sweetheart... ''

1065
02:07:19,101 --> 02:07:22,593

''Days, in love, we'll spend
like we spend moments''

1071
02:08:20,996 --> 02:08:26,593
''When did the sunset... ?
When were the lights switched on?''

1072
02:08:27,236 --> 02:08:30,103
''Listen, my dear man... ''

1073
02:08:30,606 --> 02:08:31,595
''Me''

1074
02:08:34,109 --> 02:08:40,105
''Listen, my dear man,
it's all thanks to you... ''

1075

''Everyone has gone to sleep?
Why are you awake?''

1079
02:09:47,282 --> 02:09:49,944
''What's the matter, friends?''

1080
02:09:50,352 --> 02:09:56,621
''Go to sleep, O king of the forests.
lt's night already''

1081
02:10:00,629 --> 02:10:07,125
''Sweet dreams beckon you''

1087
02:10:55,017 --> 02:10:56,951
Owner...

1088
02:11:07,129 --> 02:11:10,621
Hello brother.

1089
02:11:10,966 --> 02:11:13,628
How are you children?

1090
02:11:20,642 --> 02:11:22,200
So you own this place!

1091
02:11:22,344 --> 02:11:25,006
Eat fast, l too am famished.

1092
02:11:37,259 --> 02:11:41,593
Who are you? Why are you here?

1093
02:11:41,830 --> 02:11:46,767
lt clearly says on the board,
no touching or feeding animals.

1094
02:11:47,135 --> 02:11:50,593
l'm illiterate. l don't
know what's written there.

1095
02:11:50,772 --> 02:11:57,610
Now you know? Stuff this banana
in your mouth not the elephant's!

1096
02:11:58,613 --> 02:12:01,605
lt's a good deed to
feed a mute animal.

1097
02:12:03,785 --> 02:12:09,121
You take this money for a betel
leaf and l'll feed the elephant.

1098
02:12:09,291 --> 02:12:14,126
l can't deceive Raju even
if you pay me 400 rupees!

1099
02:12:14,329 --> 02:12:16,627
Take your money and get lost!

1100
02:12:16,798 --> 02:12:20,632
l will feed the elephant.
l'll see how you stop me!

1101
02:12:26,041 --> 02:12:28,066
That fleeing man was feeding
the elephant a needle in a banana!

1102
02:13:14,789 --> 02:13:16,780
You haven't changed despite
the sentence in prison.

1103
02:13:57,799 --> 02:13:59,596
Who are you?
- Raju is chasing me!

1104
02:13:59,768 --> 02:14:01,759
Who is he?
- The owner of world of love.

1105
02:14:01,937 --> 02:14:05,100
l don't know what old enmity
prompted him to kill me.

1106
02:14:05,273 --> 02:14:08,970
Help me hide!
- Okay, hide there.

1107
02:14:19,354 --> 02:14:20,981
How did you come this way?

1108
02:14:21,122 --> 02:14:25,286
A man ran this way.
He tried to kill my elephant.

1109
02:14:26,027 --> 02:14:28,894
Nobody came here.
- l saw him myself.

1110
02:14:29,064 --> 02:14:32,727
The one you're looking
for is not here.

1111
02:14:32,934 --> 02:14:35,061
You're trying to hide him.

1112
02:14:36,838 --> 02:14:38,567
You can't go in without permission.

1113
02:14:38,707 --> 02:14:42,234
He is a criminal and it's a
crime to give refuge to a criminal.

1114
02:14:42,911 --> 02:14:45,903
l can call the police.
- Sure.

1115
02:14:46,114 --> 02:14:49,083
The criminal will wait
till they arrive.

1116
02:14:50,752 --> 02:14:53,585
Will you make a move or
should l call the guard?

1117
02:15:00,929 --> 02:15:02,920
Hey, come out.

1118
02:15:04,766 --> 02:15:07,599
Tell me the truth. Did you
try to kill his elephant?

1119
02:15:07,936 --> 02:15:10,598
Yes and l'd kill him too if l could!

1120
02:15:10,805 --> 02:15:13,603
He's my sworn enemy!
He put me out of business!

1121
02:15:13,775 --> 02:15:15,766
Shake hands.
- Pardon?

1122
02:15:16,111 --> 02:15:18,102
Raju's enemy is my friend.

1123
02:15:18,613 --> 02:15:21,605
Likes you l too have a
debt to clear with him.

1124
02:15:21,783 --> 02:15:25,879
l have a brain to think of ideas
and you have the hands to execute it.

1125
02:15:26,087 --> 02:15:28,214
We'll take revenge together.
Shake hands!

1126
02:15:29,224 --> 02:15:31,055
lt's a deal!

1127
02:15:37,565 --> 02:15:41,057
There's nothing in the X ray.
l knew the child only had cough.

1128
02:15:41,236 --> 02:15:43,227
You worry needlessly.

1129
02:15:43,872 --> 02:15:46,067
lt's natural as it's your first
child.

1130
02:15:47,575 --> 02:15:50,066
First and last too.

1131
02:15:52,914 --> 02:15:56,907
Take this medicine from the chemist
and feed the child thrice a day.

1132
02:15:59,120 --> 02:16:01,088
Come fast doctor.
There's an emergency case!

1133
02:16:03,758 --> 02:16:06,591
My child! Lord! What have you
done!

1134
02:16:07,262 --> 02:16:11,096
What happen?
- The elephant crushed him head!

1135
02:16:14,602 --> 02:16:16,934
Take him to the OT.

1136
02:16:30,552 --> 02:16:35,046
Be brave. How did this happen?

1137
02:16:38,026 --> 02:16:40,051
My destiny was against me!

1138
02:16:41,029 --> 02:16:47,059
His father is a mahout. He grew
amongst elephants right from birth.

1139
02:16:48,103 --> 02:16:50,071
He always played with them.

1140
02:16:50,572 --> 02:16:56,909
God knows what happened.
The elephant went mad suddenly.

1141
02:16:58,113 --> 02:17:02,072
He picked up the child in
his trunk and threw him down!

1142
02:17:03,718 --> 02:17:06,585
After all he's an animal!

1143
02:17:19,768 --> 02:17:24,603
God knows what happened.
The elephant went mad suddenly.

1144
02:17:25,940 --> 02:17:29,103
He picked up the child in his
trunk and threw him down!

1145
02:17:30,111 --> 02:17:32,102
After all he's an animal!

1146
02:17:32,814 --> 02:17:39,947
After all he's an animal!

1147
02:17:42,290 --> 02:17:45,123
What's wrong?
- Nothing. Go on.

1148
02:18:32,106 --> 02:18:34,597
Calm, down! What's wrong?

1149
02:18:36,010 --> 02:18:39,605
Ramu crushed my son!

1150
02:18:40,148 --> 02:18:43,948
He killed my son!
- What's wrong with you?

1151
02:18:44,118 --> 02:18:46,109
You are carrying your son!

1152
02:18:49,290 --> 02:18:52,623
My baby! My darling!

1153
02:18:56,431 --> 02:18:58,296
Then what is that?

1154
02:19:02,971 --> 02:19:04,962
Silly girl! lt's a doll.

1155
02:19:05,139 --> 02:19:09,633
l'll get 10 such dolls
for my son from the market.

1156
02:19:12,814 --> 02:19:17,308
You can buy dolls from the market
but can you get me another son?

1157
02:19:17,886 --> 02:19:21,151
What are you taking?
- My heart sinks!

1158
02:19:22,190 --> 02:19:25,921
My son can suffer the same
fate as the doll someday.

1159
02:19:26,094 --> 02:19:29,928
What?
- Send Ramu out and tie him in chains.

1160
02:19:30,098 --> 02:19:33,090
Bind him in chains? But why?

1161
02:19:33,835 --> 02:19:38,135
l saw a mahout's son in the hospital.

1162
02:19:39,073 --> 02:19:42,099
His face is swimming
before my eyes even now!

1163
02:19:42,877 --> 02:19:45,937
My heart is not in control!

1164
02:19:47,615 --> 02:19:49,606
The child was playing
with the elephant.

1165
02:19:50,151 --> 02:19:53,609
When suddenly the elephant lifted
him in his trunk and threw him down!

1166
02:19:53,821 --> 02:19:56,119
And crushed him underfoot!

1167
02:19:56,758 --> 02:20:00,125
l don't want this to
happen to my son someday!

1168
02:20:01,129 --> 02:20:04,121
Tie Ramu up!

1169
02:20:04,299 --> 02:20:07,962
Do you think Ramu will ever do this?

1170
02:20:08,670 --> 02:20:13,130
Once you said he loves
our son more than we do.

1171
02:20:13,808 --> 02:20:19,144
He looks after him so well.
- Whatever said, he is an animal!

1172
02:20:19,314 --> 02:20:22,147
How can you trust him?
- But l fully trust him.

1173
02:20:22,850 --> 02:20:26,081
l don't think our son can
face any danger from him!

1174
02:20:26,588 --> 02:20:28,579
You are mistaken.

1175
02:20:28,790 --> 02:20:34,751
No! My heart says take
him out and tie him up!

1176
02:20:34,963 --> 02:20:43,598
l can do anything for you but tying
him up is akin to tying my little son!

1177
02:20:44,272 --> 02:20:47,105
l'm not asking this for myself!

1178
02:20:47,775 --> 02:20:50,608
l want our child's well being!

1179
02:20:51,145 --> 02:20:53,943
he is your life and mine too!

1180
02:20:54,616 --> 02:20:58,609
lf you care for me and
love your son even a little...

1181
02:20:59,087 --> 02:21:03,956
You will tie him up!
l bind you by oath!

1182
02:21:04,292 --> 02:21:06,283
Tie him up! Please!

1183
02:21:16,104 --> 02:21:23,135
Tougher than your iron chains...
much more cruel...

1184
02:21:31,586 --> 02:21:35,920
My pal, you can cry.
l can't even do that.

1185
02:21:37,825 --> 02:21:39,588
Come on.

1186
02:22:11,793 --> 02:22:16,127
lf you care for me
and love your son...

1187
02:22:16,297 --> 02:22:18,629
Then tie him up!

1188
02:22:19,067 --> 02:22:22,628
l bind you by oath!
Tie him up!

1189
02:22:42,323 --> 02:22:46,054
l'm tying myself up in
this chain not you.

1190
02:22:47,595 --> 02:22:49,586
Forgive me if you can.

1191
02:22:54,602 --> 02:22:59,596
l ask what have you done so far?
l've paid so much money and you. .

1192
02:23:00,141 --> 02:23:05,943
l've made such a plan that Raju's
name will be wiped off the earth!

1193
02:23:06,080 --> 02:23:08,105
What plan is that?
- Listen...

1194
02:23:11,285 --> 02:23:13,617
Coming madam.
- Come this way.

1195
02:23:14,789 --> 02:23:16,950
Take him out to play.
- All right.

1196
02:23:19,627 --> 02:23:23,620
Take care of him.
Ramu is tied outside.

1197
02:23:24,031 --> 02:23:25,965
Don't let him come near Suraj.

1198
02:23:26,234 --> 02:23:27,565
Okay

1199
02:23:52,093 --> 02:23:54,755
Good baby. l'll just be back.

1200
02:23:56,931 --> 02:23:58,762
Where did you get this from?

1201
02:23:58,933 --> 02:24:01,766
For you.
- Me? Show!

1202
02:24:23,090 --> 02:24:25,718
Why is the elephant roaring?
- Let him. Why are you yelling?

1203
02:24:25,893 --> 02:24:28,555
l left baby alone. l hope...

1204
02:24:28,729 --> 02:24:30,822
He is tied there.
You be comfortable.

1205
02:24:47,748 --> 02:24:49,579
Help!

1206
02:25:01,762 --> 02:25:05,596
llliterate! lgnorant woman!
Told you keep Suraj away from him!

1207
02:25:05,766 --> 02:25:07,757
Honestly, it's not my fault!

1208
02:25:08,002 --> 02:25:11,938
We were playing when he came
after breaking his chains.

1209
02:25:12,106 --> 02:25:15,598
He kicked me aside and wrapped
the child in his trunk!

1210
02:25:22,283 --> 02:25:24,945
What happened?
- l can't stay in this...

1211
02:25:25,119 --> 02:25:27,212
house for one minute!
- Why? What's the matter?

1212
02:25:28,055 --> 02:25:33,049
Paro had taken baby out when Ramu
broke his chain, tried to kill my son.

1213
02:25:33,661 --> 02:25:36,562
You are mistaken.
- This is true!

1214
02:25:36,697 --> 02:25:38,688
l myself saw it!

1215
02:25:39,066 --> 02:25:42,058
l reached in time and saved him.

1216
02:25:42,570 --> 02:25:44,561
Or he would have crushed him!

1217
02:25:44,972 --> 02:25:48,237
Ask Paro if you don't believe me!

1218
02:25:48,676 --> 02:25:52,737
l agree Ramu may
have broken the chain.

1219
02:25:53,047 --> 02:25:57,575
He may have gone close to baby,
but to play with him not kill him.

1220
02:25:58,319 --> 02:26:00,913
You know how he loves him.

1221
02:26:01,589 --> 02:26:03,580
Everything would have finished
today!

1222
02:26:04,258 --> 02:26:08,592
But l'm amazed that the
animal means all to you.

1223
02:26:08,763 --> 02:26:11,095
l mean nothing, your
son means nothing!

1224
02:26:11,599 --> 02:26:17,094
Why do you say that?
lt's your imagination.

1225
02:26:17,405 --> 02:26:22,934
No! l only know that l
don't want Ramu here! No!

1226
02:26:23,144 --> 02:26:27,547
Don't forget it was Ramu
who brought us together.

1227
02:26:27,949 --> 02:26:30,042
All our joys are thanks to him!

1228
02:26:30,551 --> 02:26:35,045
The car you drive in, the
ornaments you wear are his gifts!

1229
02:26:35,556 --> 02:26:37,888
We are obliged to him.

1230
02:26:38,960 --> 02:26:42,088
Do you want me to sacrifice my son
to repay this animal's obligations?

1231
02:26:42,630 --> 02:26:44,723
Do you want me to shoot Ramu?

1232
02:26:45,066 --> 02:26:51,562
Hear me out! As long as Ramu is
here, l won't stay here nor my son!

1233
02:26:51,772 --> 02:26:53,797
You are blind in love for your son!

1234
02:26:54,041 --> 02:26:57,909
Your love for that animal
is blind, deaf and mad!

1235
02:26:58,045 --> 02:27:00,570
Do you think l'm my son's enemy?

1236
02:27:00,781 --> 02:27:03,079
Yes, you are his enemy!

1237
02:27:11,759 --> 02:27:15,160
ls this how you treat my child?
Aren't you ashamed to beat her?

1238
02:27:15,363 --> 02:27:17,593
l could kill her today!

1239
02:27:17,732 --> 02:27:18,926
Stop it!

1240
02:27:19,066 --> 02:27:21,591
You seem to have turned into
an animal with those elephants!

1241
02:27:21,769 --> 02:27:25,933
Yes, l've turned an animal!
lf you so proud of being human...

1242
02:27:26,107 --> 02:27:28,098
get the hell out of here
and take your daughter too!

1243
02:27:31,812 --> 02:27:34,940
Tanu, l'm not going to let you
stay here for another minute.

1244
02:27:36,083 --> 02:27:39,610
l got my daughter married to him.
l didn't sell my self-respect!

1245
02:27:40,087 --> 02:27:43,614
Let's go, dear.
- Go away! l don't need anyone!

1246
02:28:16,323 --> 02:28:18,985
Worthless being!

1247
02:28:20,061 --> 02:28:23,997
l had shacked you, hadn't l?
Why did you break the chain?

1248
02:28:26,067 --> 02:28:28,092
Why did you go anywhere
near the child?

1249
02:28:28,836 --> 02:28:30,599
Why did you... ?

1250
02:28:35,076 --> 02:28:40,605
Why did you... ?
Tell me!

1251
02:29:24,658 --> 02:29:27,593
No Daddy, l can't leave my home.

1252
02:29:28,596 --> 02:29:31,588
You can take me home
but not change my destiny.

1253
02:29:32,133 --> 02:29:37,093
Destiny is too great,
l can't even change your mind.

1254
02:29:37,771 --> 02:29:41,605
l'm not asking you to leave
your husband or your home.

1255
02:29:42,143 --> 02:29:45,112
l'm just asking you to come
with me for a few days.

1256
02:29:46,080 --> 02:29:49,106
Today Raju is angry.
Tomorrow he will cool down.

1257
02:29:49,350 --> 02:29:52,285
And come for you.
- lf he doesn't. . ?

1258
02:29:53,154 --> 02:29:57,147
l will swallow my pride
and come to drop you back.

1259
02:29:57,625 --> 02:30:00,617
Come, my dear. Let's go.

1260
02:30:17,411 --> 02:30:21,643
Move aside. My daughter won't
stay here as long as you are here.

1261
02:30:43,070 --> 02:30:46,597
Raju will scold me.
Don't follow them.

1262
02:30:46,774 --> 02:30:48,765
Go back, l say!

1263
02:30:54,615 --> 02:30:56,606
Your wife left with
her father in the car.

1264
02:30:56,884 --> 02:30:58,943
And Ramu followed them.

1265
02:31:11,632 --> 02:31:13,964
l slapped you in a fit of temper.

1266
02:31:14,902 --> 02:31:17,632
But you left home.

1267
02:31:26,080 --> 02:31:28,071
Telegram for you sir.
- Telegram?

1268
02:31:34,588 --> 02:31:38,080
What's wrong Daddy?
- My friend had a stroke in Mysore.

1269
02:31:39,593 --> 02:31:42,084
Do you have to go there?
- That's what l'm wondering.

1270
02:31:42,763 --> 02:31:45,926
How do l leave you
alone in this state?

1271
02:31:47,134 --> 02:31:50,592
Don't worry about me.
Go and return soon.

1272
02:31:50,771 --> 02:31:53,604
Take care of yourself and the baby.

1273
02:32:03,617 --> 02:32:05,608
Get a box of milk powder
for the baby from the market.

1274
02:32:27,107 --> 02:32:29,575
You've followed me
here too! Go away!

1275
02:32:33,747 --> 02:32:35,578
l said, go away!

1276
02:32:36,850 --> 02:32:38,579
Go away!

1277
02:32:40,120 --> 02:32:42,088
No! l won't go with you!

1278
02:32:42,756 --> 02:32:45,919
l can't live in that house
peacefully as long as you're there!

1279
02:32:58,272 --> 02:33:00,934
All right. Stay here if you wish!

1280
02:33:23,630 --> 02:33:27,066
l'm glad you called. l was
worried where to contact you.

1281
02:33:27,568 --> 02:33:30,901
What's wrong?
- Ramu came here after you left.

1282
02:33:31,238 --> 02:33:36,073
He won't budge. l don't think
he'll leave without killing my son.

1283
02:33:36,977 --> 02:33:40,071
The servant has gone home.
l'm very frightened.

1284
02:33:40,647 --> 02:33:42,581
Come back as soon as possible.

1285
02:33:42,750 --> 02:33:47,585
l'll leave immediately and
l'll bring a hunter friend along.

1286
02:33:48,088 --> 02:33:51,751
He'll shoot the elephant.
You take care of Suraj.

1287
02:34:39,740 --> 02:34:41,901
This animal is a pain!

1288
02:34:58,926 --> 02:34:59,915
No!

1289
02:35:02,262 --> 02:35:04,253
l won't let you go near my son!

1290
02:35:04,665 --> 02:35:08,601
l won't let you in! Go away!

1291
02:35:44,738 --> 02:35:46,729
How did this door break?.

1292
02:35:47,741 --> 02:35:49,732
The elephant must be responsible.

1293
02:35:50,110 --> 02:35:52,578
Where is the elephant?
- Come with me.

1294
02:36:00,587 --> 02:36:01,747
Come.

1295
02:36:18,405 --> 02:36:20,100
Do you see this snake?

1296
02:36:21,275 --> 02:36:23,766
Snake!
Where did this snake come from?

1297
02:36:25,112 --> 02:36:27,546
l smell petrol.

1298
02:36:35,088 --> 02:36:37,886
Why are you throwing petrol here?

1299
02:36:38,225 --> 02:36:40,887
Let go!
- l won't!

1300
02:37:07,588 --> 02:37:08,577
Stop!

1301
02:37:12,960 --> 02:37:14,951
Don't interfere in a fight of men!

1302
02:38:44,951 --> 02:38:46,612
Let go of him!

1303
02:38:47,120 --> 02:38:48,951
Or l'll shoot you!

1304
02:38:49,890 --> 02:38:51,619
l say, let go of him!

1305
02:39:07,307 --> 02:39:11,141
Scoundrel! Rascal!
You shot my Ramu!

1306
02:39:11,812 --> 02:39:17,148
l'll kill you!
l won't spare you!

1307
02:39:17,317 --> 02:39:20,150
These are the men!
- Yes inspector!

1308
02:39:20,654 --> 02:39:22,645
They are the ones who shot
my poor mute Ramu!

1309
02:39:23,056 --> 02:39:25,047
Take them away from my sight!

1310
02:39:42,809 --> 02:39:45,607
''A world of hatred... ''

Forgive me Raju!

1332
02:44:01,601 --> 02:44:06,095
Now what do you want?
My pal, Ramu is no more.

1333
02:44:07,140 --> 02:44:09,131
My world is ruined.

1334
02:44:10,043 --> 02:44:12,603
l want nothing now!

1335
02:44:12,879 --> 02:44:15,609
Don't say that! Please!

1336
02:44:16,049 --> 02:44:18,609
Maternal love had
really turned me blind!

1337
02:44:19,619 --> 02:44:22,110
The Ramu l considered
my son's enemy...

1338
02:44:23,023 --> 02:44:26,049
That very Ramu saved him
from a snake and proved...

1339
02:44:26,726 --> 02:44:29,559
that he was his protector not enemy.

1340
02:44:30,697 --> 02:44:36,067
And today he has done me a great
obligation by saving my husband!

1341
02:44:36,736 --> 02:44:39,068
l can never forget him all life!

1342
02:44:45,078 --> 02:44:49,071
There's no point repenting.
The one who had to, has gone.

1343
02:44:49,649 --> 02:44:53,915
You didn't pay heed to me.
And shunned your own family.

1344
02:44:54,587 --> 02:44:57,750
And this poor mute guy
gave his life to prove that.

1345
02:44:58,058 --> 02:45:02,757
Wouldn't any mother have done
what l did seeing her child in danger?

1346
02:45:04,064 --> 02:45:08,091
How could a heart quivering with
fear understand your arguments?

1347
02:45:08,334 --> 02:45:10,598
How could l hear them?

1348
02:45:12,872 --> 02:45:13,930
Son...

1349
02:45:17,043 --> 02:45:19,603
l am the culprit.

1350
02:45:20,280 --> 02:45:24,273
l request you to forgive
me and my daughter.

1351
02:45:25,285 --> 02:45:27,549
Give us an opportunity to atone.

1352
02:45:34,294 --> 02:45:39,061
What are you thinking of?.
- Yes, forgive me.

1353
02:45:39,299 --> 02:45:46,068
For your darling son whom you
love and Ramu too had loved.

1354
02:45:47,073 --> 02:45:48,904
Forgive us.

1355
02:46:20,607 --> 02:46:22,598
Get up, Tanu.

1356
02:46:24,978 --> 02:46:27,913
Ramu brought us together
for the first time.

1357
02:46:29,048 --> 02:46:32,540
Today he gave his life
to unite us again.
