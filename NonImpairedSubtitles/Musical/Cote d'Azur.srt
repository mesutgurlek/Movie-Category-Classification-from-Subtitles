1
00:00:51,484 --> 00:00:53,611
COTE D'AZUR

2
00:02:53,506 --> 00:02:57,306
In my grandma's garden in HoIIand,
I was sure she had a weII.

3
00:02:57,844 --> 00:03:01,712
I was positive. I couId describe it.
I saw it so cIearIy.

4
00:03:03,016 --> 00:03:07,180
The bricks, the coping, the bucket,
the tuIips aII around...

5
00:03:07,787 --> 00:03:09,812
But no. There was no weII.

6
00:03:10,123 --> 00:03:11,181
They fiIIed it in?

7
00:03:11,357 --> 00:03:13,291
It had never been there.

8
00:03:13,993 --> 00:03:16,928
Like your castIe.
We couIdn't see it from the road.

9
00:03:17,096 --> 00:03:18,461
We can't see it here.

10
00:03:19,132 --> 00:03:21,032
But you imagined it was there.

11
00:03:23,336 --> 00:03:24,963
I can see it, Beatrix.

12
00:03:25,071 --> 00:03:28,302
The coastIine, the rocks,
the sea and the castIe.

13
00:03:28,474 --> 00:03:29,805
ExactIy Iike here.

14
00:03:33,580 --> 00:03:34,547
There.

15
00:03:34,747 --> 00:03:36,112
Yes, there.

16
00:03:36,883 --> 00:03:38,475
The pine trees have grown.

17
00:03:38,818 --> 00:03:42,049
In 25 years, they've had time to grow.

18
00:03:46,993 --> 00:03:50,326
It's behind the pine trees, Marc.
Behind the trees.

19
00:03:54,167 --> 00:03:55,930
Stupid asshoIe!

20
00:04:01,908 --> 00:04:03,773
Cut it out! Wat's going on?

21
00:04:03,943 --> 00:04:04,910
CharIy's a pain!

22
00:04:05,078 --> 00:04:07,478
She's a pain.
She's Ieaving tomorrow...

23
00:04:08,748 --> 00:04:10,409
She can sIeep somewhere eIse.

24
00:04:10,950 --> 00:04:11,882
He can wait.

25
00:04:13,086 --> 00:04:15,486
Hey, we're on vacation!

26
00:04:17,290 --> 00:04:20,282
So kindIy work this out
without screaming!

27
00:04:21,527 --> 00:04:23,757
Laura, give CharIy the room.

28
00:04:23,930 --> 00:04:25,727
CharIy can do the dishes tonight.

29
00:04:28,501 --> 00:04:30,435
Any comments?

30
00:04:32,772 --> 00:04:33,704
Perfect!

31
00:04:34,207 --> 00:04:38,041
As my grandma used to say,
aII's weII that ends...

32
00:04:38,344 --> 00:04:39,333
...weII.

33
00:04:45,418 --> 00:04:47,784
Look at that coIor...

34
00:04:49,989 --> 00:04:52,981
We have to eat stuff Iike that
on the Riviera?

35
00:04:53,159 --> 00:04:55,923
You don't have to.
It's an opportunity.

36
00:04:56,396 --> 00:04:58,387
It's fuII of iodine. It's heaIthy.

37
00:04:58,564 --> 00:05:00,930
You can't get violets in Paris.

38
00:05:02,068 --> 00:05:03,228
It's been years.

39
00:05:03,403 --> 00:05:05,394
Maybe it's Iike your castIe.

40
00:05:05,571 --> 00:05:08,301
You dreamed it was deIicious
but it's ordinary.

41
00:05:08,474 --> 00:05:09,566
Or even gross.

42
00:05:14,614 --> 00:05:15,911
Wat?

43
00:05:17,050 --> 00:05:18,381
It's good. I toId you.

44
00:05:18,484 --> 00:05:20,315
It reminds you of something?

45
00:05:20,653 --> 00:05:21,745
Of course.

46
00:05:22,088 --> 00:05:23,680
Anything specific?

47
00:05:24,357 --> 00:05:27,019
No, just things...
Forgotten sensations.

48
00:05:29,395 --> 00:05:31,863
It reminds me I hate raw things.

49
00:05:32,031 --> 00:05:33,658
Don't get me started!

50
00:05:35,168 --> 00:05:37,728
You're outdoing each other
in regression?

51
00:05:43,242 --> 00:05:44,937
It's reaIIy good.

52
00:05:46,312 --> 00:05:49,247
Do we have some Iemon or pepper?

53
00:05:49,882 --> 00:05:53,045
Pepper, that's it.
They need some seasoning.

54
00:06:33,926 --> 00:06:35,723
Leave us some hot water!

55
00:06:51,444 --> 00:06:54,436
It's crazy how teens today
Iove to scrub.

56
00:06:55,815 --> 00:06:57,407
Wen I came here, I'd forget.

57
00:06:57,950 --> 00:06:58,917
That's gross!

58
00:07:01,220 --> 00:07:02,312
It's cIeaner here.

59
00:07:03,990 --> 00:07:06,049
I Iiked the taste of saIty skin.

60
00:07:06,793 --> 00:07:07,782
Come on,

61
00:07:07,960 --> 00:07:10,087
you're not rationing hot water?

62
00:07:10,263 --> 00:07:12,288
It's not just the hot water.

63
00:07:12,465 --> 00:07:16,265
Wen you wash too often,
you get skin probIems.

64
00:07:16,569 --> 00:07:17,934
Everyone knows that.

65
00:07:18,304 --> 00:07:21,535
And wasting water Iike that
is bad for the pIanet.

66
00:07:21,874 --> 00:07:23,068
Okay, I get it.

67
00:07:23,242 --> 00:07:25,267
From now on, no more showers.

68
00:07:25,778 --> 00:07:28,804
You're so excessive.
Moderation is aII we ask.

69
00:07:29,916 --> 00:07:31,907
Dad, what's with the hot water?.

70
00:07:38,691 --> 00:07:39,749
At the station.

71
00:07:39,926 --> 00:07:41,757
It's my dad's fauIt.

72
00:07:42,628 --> 00:07:43,959
The weather is great.

73
00:07:45,565 --> 00:07:46,497
Like violets?

74
00:07:48,100 --> 00:07:50,660
They're weird. Soft and purpIe.

75
00:07:51,771 --> 00:07:52,863
I mean yeIIow.

76
00:08:17,363 --> 00:08:18,694
You've grown.

77
00:08:19,198 --> 00:08:21,325
- How Iong has it been?
-Ayear.

78
00:08:21,868 --> 00:08:23,199
Think I've changed?

79
00:08:23,736 --> 00:08:24,862
You've...

80
00:08:25,705 --> 00:08:27,935
SuddenIy I reaIize CharIy has...

81
00:08:28,708 --> 00:08:29,766
Come on, Dad.

82
00:08:30,176 --> 00:08:32,303
Got nothing better to taIk about?

83
00:08:40,286 --> 00:08:42,720
I hope you don't Iive
in the shower too.

84
00:09:04,744 --> 00:09:05,972
Wow, you've grown!

85
00:09:06,712 --> 00:09:08,077
Dad's aIready said that.

86
00:09:08,247 --> 00:09:09,839
If everything's been said,

87
00:09:10,016 --> 00:09:11,677
we can sIeep easy!

88
00:09:14,921 --> 00:09:16,912
You know where the sheets are.

89
00:09:27,300 --> 00:09:28,324
Separate rooms?

90
00:09:29,735 --> 00:09:30,895
You can have mine.

91
00:09:31,304 --> 00:09:33,272
You get the best view.

92
00:09:35,007 --> 00:09:35,974
Thanks.

93
00:09:37,076 --> 00:09:40,136
I guess you're right.
It's safer this way.

94
00:09:40,913 --> 00:09:43,347
I'm on the other side of the Ianding.

95
00:09:44,317 --> 00:09:47,980
Do you mind keeping the sheets?
I sIept in them one night

96
00:09:48,154 --> 00:09:49,917
and I behaved myseIf.

97
00:09:53,025 --> 00:09:53,957
Be right back.

98
00:10:02,101 --> 00:10:03,659
CharIy's not here?

99
00:10:04,236 --> 00:10:05,931
He's moving into his room.

100
00:10:06,939 --> 00:10:08,201
His room?

101
00:10:23,956 --> 00:10:25,446
Wat's that about the shower?

102
00:10:25,791 --> 00:10:26,849
Nothing.

103
00:10:27,026 --> 00:10:29,119
I was jerking off in the shower.

104
00:10:29,295 --> 00:10:32,355
They were pissed
because I used aII the hot water.

105
00:10:33,332 --> 00:10:35,562
Your dad toId me not to jerk off?

106
00:10:35,901 --> 00:10:39,268
No, stupid. He doesn't know
I jerk off in the shower.

107
00:10:39,438 --> 00:10:42,430
He thinks I spend
too Iong in the shower.

108
00:10:43,576 --> 00:10:45,544
Maybe he's smarter than you think.

109
00:10:45,878 --> 00:10:48,574
Everyone jerks off in the shower.

110
00:10:49,215 --> 00:10:50,773
ReaIIy? You too?

111
00:10:51,317 --> 00:10:54,047
Sometimes.
It's not my favorite spot.

112
00:10:55,221 --> 00:10:57,382
I prefer the toiIets at schooI.

113
00:11:02,395 --> 00:11:03,384
WAnt to try?

114
00:11:14,640 --> 00:11:17,609
I'II tighten the chain.
It'II be fine.

115
00:11:19,345 --> 00:11:21,176
We're going for a waIk.

116
00:11:21,514 --> 00:11:22,708
Back for Iunch?

117
00:11:23,349 --> 00:11:25,010
Of course.

118
00:11:30,389 --> 00:11:32,152
Ever think CharIy couId be gay?

119
00:11:33,059 --> 00:11:33,991
Gay?

120
00:11:39,331 --> 00:11:40,923
Wat do you think?

121
00:11:41,233 --> 00:11:43,827
I don't know.
Were did this come from?

122
00:11:44,837 --> 00:11:48,170
Seeing him with Martin,
it was Iike a reveIation.

123
00:11:49,775 --> 00:11:52,243
SuddenIy it aII made sense.

124
00:11:53,379 --> 00:11:54,346
Wat?

125
00:11:55,247 --> 00:11:56,214
You're crazy.

126
00:11:59,085 --> 00:12:00,052
How was it?

127
00:12:00,286 --> 00:12:02,982
Freezing.
Good Iuck. You'II need it.

128
00:12:03,255 --> 00:12:04,381
It's the sea breeze.

129
00:12:05,024 --> 00:12:07,288
The water's much coIder in PortugaI.

130
00:12:08,094 --> 00:12:09,459
I'm not going there to swim!

131
00:12:14,867 --> 00:12:15,959
First up,

132
00:12:16,869 --> 00:12:18,860
CharIy's never brought a girI home.

133
00:12:19,138 --> 00:12:20,196
CamiIIe.

134
00:12:20,473 --> 00:12:22,304
He was in primary schooI.

135
00:12:22,608 --> 00:12:23,870
Second...

136
00:12:24,176 --> 00:12:26,269
I don't know. It's so obvious.

137
00:12:27,079 --> 00:12:29,172
Martin is his boyfriend.

138
00:12:29,915 --> 00:12:31,940
They've had no contact for a year.

139
00:12:32,351 --> 00:12:33,283
That's just it.

140
00:12:33,452 --> 00:12:37,115
At their age, they onIy fight
for sentimentaI reasons.

141
00:12:37,556 --> 00:12:39,114
CharIy pIays soccer!

142
00:12:40,059 --> 00:12:41,026
Third,

143
00:12:41,293 --> 00:12:43,124
and this is the reaI argument

144
00:12:43,929 --> 00:12:46,989
CharIy and Martin
are sIeeping in separate rooms.

145
00:12:47,166 --> 00:12:48,565
Kids never do that,

146
00:12:49,135 --> 00:12:51,228
unIess they're hiding something.

147
00:12:51,604 --> 00:12:53,799
That's totaIIy ridicuIous.

148
00:12:55,875 --> 00:12:57,342
ReIax!

149
00:12:58,410 --> 00:13:00,537
It's sunny, this house is divine,

150
00:13:00,880 --> 00:13:02,905
CharIy's gay. Wat's the probIem?

151
00:13:03,349 --> 00:13:06,944
It's easier to take
than if I said he wasn't yours.

152
00:13:31,277 --> 00:13:34,440
The newspaper says more and more
young peopIe have AIDS.

153
00:13:36,382 --> 00:13:37,610
Wat's with you?

154
00:13:38,317 --> 00:13:40,046
I read it this morning.

155
00:13:41,120 --> 00:13:44,180
Since nobody's taIking,
I thought I'd bring it up.

156
00:13:44,356 --> 00:13:46,051
It's important, right?

157
00:13:47,526 --> 00:13:48,857
Not reaIIy.

158
00:13:49,161 --> 00:13:50,287
You're wrong.

159
00:13:50,462 --> 00:13:52,293
AIDS concems you. Be carefuI.

160
00:13:53,833 --> 00:13:55,801
Your sexuaIity's fine with me.

161
00:13:56,435 --> 00:13:58,403
Be free but protect yourseIves.

162
00:13:58,938 --> 00:14:01,736
Cut it out.
Are you the schooI nurse?

163
00:14:03,209 --> 00:14:05,370
Afree rubber with every
Band-Aid!

164
00:14:05,544 --> 00:14:07,341
40-year-oIds are no exampIe.

165
00:14:08,747 --> 00:14:10,806
With their middIe-aged Iust...

166
00:14:11,350 --> 00:14:12,442
So your advice...

167
00:14:13,819 --> 00:14:16,310
I can never taIk seriousIy with you two.

168
00:14:17,122 --> 00:14:20,523
Martin's more aduIt.
You take precautions, I hope.

169
00:14:20,860 --> 00:14:24,921
Marc, Ieave Martin aIone.
You're making him uncomfortabIe.

170
00:14:25,097 --> 00:14:26,394
Not at aII.

171
00:14:27,299 --> 00:14:28,960
Wy be uncomfortabIe?

172
00:14:30,302 --> 00:14:32,770
We can taIk freeIy about sex, right?

173
00:14:33,172 --> 00:14:34,332
SeriousIy, Dad,

174
00:14:35,307 --> 00:14:38,003
the Iiberated, caring act
is not your styIe.

175
00:14:40,379 --> 00:14:42,745
He was over the top about AIDS.

176
00:14:42,915 --> 00:14:44,746
He thinks we sIeep together.

177
00:14:45,918 --> 00:14:47,476
That bothers you?

178
00:14:49,188 --> 00:14:51,349
No, not reaIIy.

179
00:14:51,523 --> 00:14:53,821
In fact, it's pretty funny.

180
00:14:54,860 --> 00:14:57,055
HopefuIIy, it pisses him off.

181
00:14:58,297 --> 00:15:00,424
No, it wouId be good.

182
00:15:02,868 --> 00:15:06,167
Yourfather's nice.
You treat him Iike a bIockhead.

183
00:15:07,239 --> 00:15:09,230
He's my dad, that's aII.

184
00:15:09,441 --> 00:15:11,102
He gets on my nerves.

185
00:15:12,111 --> 00:15:14,739
It's not Iike you think,
a ''coming out''.

186
00:15:14,914 --> 00:15:15,846
Awhat?

187
00:15:17,149 --> 00:15:19,310
Coming out of the cIoset.

188
00:15:19,852 --> 00:15:21,012
Wat cIoset?

189
00:15:28,427 --> 00:15:31,521
It's a poetic image.
It means not hiding anymore,

190
00:15:31,864 --> 00:15:33,263
reveaIing your homosexuaIity.

191
00:15:34,033 --> 00:15:35,193
My mother...

192
00:15:36,635 --> 00:15:38,102
She cried a IittIe,

193
00:15:38,938 --> 00:15:40,303
forform's sake.

194
00:15:40,906 --> 00:15:42,806
I think she's reaIIy happy.

195
00:15:44,009 --> 00:15:46,944
My dad acted Iike nothing happened.

196
00:15:47,179 --> 00:15:49,807
You have rich kid probIems!

197
00:15:51,850 --> 00:15:52,817
It's weird.

198
00:15:54,320 --> 00:15:55,912
It's freezing.

199
00:15:56,455 --> 00:15:57,547
It's not normaI.

200
00:15:58,257 --> 00:16:00,157
It's because of the sea breeze.

201
00:16:00,359 --> 00:16:01,849
You get used to it.

202
00:16:05,264 --> 00:16:07,357
Don't go on about it!

203
00:16:08,634 --> 00:16:11,000
I was heavy-handed, okay.

204
00:16:11,170 --> 00:16:15,300
Agay son, a daughter on a sexscapade
in PortugaI and I can't warn them?

205
00:16:15,474 --> 00:16:17,965
- Wat's a dad for?
- You're right.

206
00:16:18,143 --> 00:16:21,635
But you were pushing CharIy
to spiII the beans.

207
00:16:22,147 --> 00:16:24,172
You made him uncomfortabIe.

208
00:16:24,350 --> 00:16:27,649
If he hasn't toId us,
he feeIs the time's not right.

209
00:16:29,421 --> 00:16:33,414
Maybe he pIans
a more theatricaI ''coming out''.

210
00:16:33,592 --> 00:16:34,581
Awhat?

211
00:16:42,368 --> 00:16:43,392
MichaeI's here.

212
00:16:43,569 --> 00:16:44,593
Are you ready?

213
00:16:48,407 --> 00:16:50,534
Have a coffee before you go.

214
00:16:50,709 --> 00:16:52,574
We'II stop on the way.

215
00:16:52,911 --> 00:16:54,401
Kiss kiss!

216
00:17:12,664 --> 00:17:17,328
That guy's ass...
I never noticed he had such a hot ass.

217
00:17:19,204 --> 00:17:21,502
Wat's with women and bikers?

218
00:17:21,707 --> 00:17:23,197
He mounts his bike so...

219
00:17:27,146 --> 00:17:29,114
You're both ridicuIous, not me.

220
00:17:29,982 --> 00:17:31,506
You're not ridicuIous.

221
00:17:32,184 --> 00:17:33,344
Just a reaI father.

222
00:17:34,420 --> 00:17:36,388
It's the first time I've...

223
00:17:37,556 --> 00:17:39,353
reaIized...

224
00:17:41,060 --> 00:17:41,992
so cIearIy.

225
00:17:43,996 --> 00:17:46,021
Your daughter sIeeps with men.

226
00:17:46,698 --> 00:17:48,427
At her age, it's normaI.

227
00:17:49,535 --> 00:17:51,196
You have to get used to it.

228
00:17:52,938 --> 00:17:54,496
It was reaIIy awfuI.

229
00:17:55,240 --> 00:17:59,336
So I stopped bringing girIs home
and I don't taIk about them.

230
00:18:00,012 --> 00:18:02,310
You're surprised they think you're gay!

231
00:18:03,115 --> 00:18:06,778
You're so shy,
it's easy to get it wrong.

232
00:18:07,286 --> 00:18:08,583
I got sucked in.

233
00:18:10,122 --> 00:18:11,282
I'm not the onIy one.

234
00:18:11,990 --> 00:18:13,457
Take EIise, for exampIe.

235
00:18:15,160 --> 00:18:16,184
You toId her I'm not?

236
00:18:16,361 --> 00:18:18,295
I won't Iet you sIeep with her.

237
00:18:18,464 --> 00:18:21,092
Come off it! She's so ugIy.

238
00:18:21,834 --> 00:18:23,461
You have no eye for girIs.

239
00:18:24,002 --> 00:18:25,469
I think she's cooI.

240
00:18:25,804 --> 00:18:27,499
Of course she's not...

241
00:18:28,974 --> 00:18:30,532
instantIy stunning, but...

242
00:18:35,013 --> 00:18:37,243
I'm not Iike you make out.

243
00:18:38,083 --> 00:18:40,916
Don't get me wrong.
Breasts are important.

244
00:18:41,153 --> 00:18:43,280
FIat girls don't turn me on.

245
00:18:43,455 --> 00:18:44,922
At the same time,

246
00:18:45,491 --> 00:18:49,052
girls with huge breasts
are reaIIy intimidating.

247
00:18:49,361 --> 00:18:50,919
I don't know why.

248
00:18:51,096 --> 00:18:53,894
Maybe it's because they're sexier.

249
00:18:54,466 --> 00:18:55,455
You Iistening?

250
00:18:55,801 --> 00:18:57,359
Sorry, not reaIIy.

251
00:18:57,603 --> 00:19:00,504
Breasts don't do it for me.
Check out that guy.

252
00:19:02,141 --> 00:19:03,130
Wat about him?

253
00:19:03,308 --> 00:19:04,240
WAke up!

254
00:19:04,910 --> 00:19:05,808
He's cruising.

255
00:19:05,978 --> 00:19:07,377
Give me a break!

256
00:19:07,546 --> 00:19:09,878
He's out for a waIk, Iike us.

257
00:19:10,883 --> 00:19:13,147
It's the best spot around.

258
00:19:14,052 --> 00:19:15,451
Then he's cruising.

259
00:19:15,621 --> 00:19:18,385
Fags aIways choose the best spot.

260
00:19:18,557 --> 00:19:20,855
You're not overdoing it a IittIe?

261
00:19:27,833 --> 00:19:29,061
Not finished yet?

262
00:19:29,234 --> 00:19:32,533
Bikes are the worst.
Cars are so much simpIer.

263
00:19:32,971 --> 00:19:34,905
I'd rather go for a waIk too.

264
00:19:35,407 --> 00:19:36,806
Do you Iike it here?

265
00:19:36,975 --> 00:19:38,567
Yes, thanks. It's great.

266
00:19:38,911 --> 00:19:39,969
Were did you go?

267
00:19:40,913 --> 00:19:43,006
We took a path, further up.

268
00:19:43,549 --> 00:19:45,073
There are rocks,

269
00:19:45,250 --> 00:19:46,274
a nice view.

270
00:19:46,451 --> 00:19:48,009
It Iooks over the sea.

271
00:19:48,187 --> 00:19:49,984
Ever been to the fort?

272
00:19:50,155 --> 00:19:51,850
Rubbers everywhere. It's gross.

273
00:19:52,591 --> 00:19:55,321
But it means safe sex
is aIive and weII.

274
00:19:56,562 --> 00:19:58,154
I'II get back to my bike.

275
00:20:02,634 --> 00:20:05,034
But you want him to think you're gay?

276
00:20:05,537 --> 00:20:06,504
Yeah, but no.

277
00:20:06,672 --> 00:20:09,140
No need to Iay it on so thick.

278
00:20:10,209 --> 00:20:14,077
Don't Iook so embarrassed
when he asks where you went.

279
00:20:14,880 --> 00:20:18,611
If he's decided you're gay,
he'II see signs everywhere.

280
00:20:19,651 --> 00:20:20,549
Forget it.

281
00:20:20,886 --> 00:20:22,376
This is insane.

282
00:20:22,621 --> 00:20:25,215
How can peopIe think I'm gay?
SeriousIy!

283
00:20:27,893 --> 00:20:29,588
You're too cute to be straight.

284
00:20:32,397 --> 00:20:34,991
I think it's time you came out.

285
00:20:37,469 --> 00:20:39,266
Don't worry so much.

286
00:20:40,439 --> 00:20:42,168
Let things happen.

287
00:20:42,407 --> 00:20:43,533
My mind's a bIank.

288
00:20:44,142 --> 00:20:45,109
Liar!

289
00:20:45,711 --> 00:20:47,906
You were thinking about Charly.

290
00:20:48,614 --> 00:20:50,741
Maybe. It wasn't conscious.

291
00:20:51,617 --> 00:20:54,142
Your chiIdren's sexuaIity bothers you.

292
00:20:55,020 --> 00:20:56,817
You shouId stop thinking about it.

293
00:20:57,222 --> 00:21:00,191
And stop trying
to taIk to them about it.

294
00:21:00,759 --> 00:21:01,851
Stick to cars?

295
00:21:04,563 --> 00:21:06,861
You didn't have a Dutch mother.

296
00:21:07,032 --> 00:21:10,661
Wen we taIked about sex,
it came naturaIIy.

297
00:21:11,069 --> 00:21:14,095
You can't. You get tense.
It's not yourfauIt.

298
00:21:15,507 --> 00:21:16,735
It's about upbringing,

299
00:21:17,109 --> 00:21:19,236
Ieaming to be toIerant.

300
00:21:19,845 --> 00:21:22,814
Sometimes I think
you're too toIerant.

301
00:21:23,248 --> 00:21:25,512
That proves you don't get it.

302
00:21:26,652 --> 00:21:30,179
You can't be ''too toIerant''.
Either you are or you're not.

303
00:21:32,024 --> 00:21:33,582
I'm teIIing you,

304
00:21:34,159 --> 00:21:35,558
forget it.

305
00:21:41,033 --> 00:21:42,000
Listen.

306
00:21:42,301 --> 00:21:45,270
''The erect,
fuII-bodied femaIe panicIes

307
00:21:45,604 --> 00:21:49,540
''contrast with the thin,
mangy maIe panicIes.''

308
00:21:50,542 --> 00:21:51,600
Interesting...

309
00:22:20,305 --> 00:22:21,795
Yes, Mathieu.

310
00:22:25,644 --> 00:22:26,838
I'm on my bicycIe

311
00:22:27,012 --> 00:22:29,947
on a deIightfuI IittIe road.

312
00:22:31,116 --> 00:22:32,048
And you?

313
00:22:33,618 --> 00:22:34,550
Wat?

314
00:22:47,399 --> 00:22:49,094
At the station, of course.

315
00:22:49,434 --> 00:22:50,366
Where are you?

316
00:22:54,906 --> 00:22:58,569
I'm not angry.
Just a IittIe surprised.

317
00:22:59,177 --> 00:23:00,610
I can't see you.

318
00:23:20,132 --> 00:23:21,599
Do you Iike violets?

319
00:23:27,939 --> 00:23:29,338
AsheIIfish.

320
00:23:29,674 --> 00:23:30,902
They're soft and purpIe.

321
00:23:34,212 --> 00:23:36,271
I mean yeIIow.

322
00:23:45,657 --> 00:23:47,215
Not reaIIy yeIIow.

323
00:23:56,168 --> 00:23:57,760
If I understand,

324
00:23:58,336 --> 00:23:59,928
you're pIanning...

325
00:24:00,872 --> 00:24:04,330
to spend your vacation here.

326
00:24:04,676 --> 00:24:05,665
Let's say,

327
00:24:07,279 --> 00:24:08,746
part of it.

328
00:24:12,250 --> 00:24:13,581
Here with you.

329
00:24:15,220 --> 00:24:17,085
If you want, I can Ieave.

330
00:24:20,091 --> 00:24:21,649
Spare me the bIind...

331
00:24:22,727 --> 00:24:23,921
devotion.

332
00:24:26,932 --> 00:24:28,297
Let's just say I find

333
00:24:30,035 --> 00:24:32,560
the situation...

334
00:24:34,039 --> 00:24:35,097
a IittIe...

335
00:24:37,375 --> 00:24:38,774
tacky.

336
00:24:43,648 --> 00:24:48,051
I don't want to spend my time
inventing stratagems to fooI Marc.

337
00:24:49,421 --> 00:24:51,218
It's degrading, isn't it?

338
00:24:51,857 --> 00:24:53,848
Wat's so different here?

339
00:24:54,025 --> 00:24:56,858
At home,
Marc deaIs with his customers.

340
00:24:57,028 --> 00:24:59,792
I aIways have a reason
to Ieave the garage.

341
00:25:00,232 --> 00:25:02,723
At home, you fit into my scheduIe...

342
00:25:02,901 --> 00:25:05,028
I'II make sure I fit in.

343
00:25:05,670 --> 00:25:06,864
Maybe.

344
00:25:08,773 --> 00:25:11,333
But then we'II faII into a routine

345
00:25:11,776 --> 00:25:14,711
and vacations
are meant to break routines.

346
00:25:14,980 --> 00:25:16,811
You want me to Ieave?

347
00:25:18,450 --> 00:25:19,747
Not reaIIy.

348
00:25:20,752 --> 00:25:24,017
I'm trying to find a way
to make you a summer Iover.

349
00:25:26,992 --> 00:25:28,755
A romantic Iover...

350
00:25:34,866 --> 00:25:36,094
You have it aII wrong.

351
00:25:36,268 --> 00:25:39,635
Josette was a very beautifuI,
inteIIigent woman.

352
00:25:40,205 --> 00:25:42,673
At 70, she stiII turned men's heads.

353
00:25:42,841 --> 00:25:44,001
She had Iovers.

354
00:25:44,175 --> 00:25:46,575
That's so absurd, you can't imagine.

355
00:25:46,811 --> 00:25:50,008
Not as sad as imagining
a 101-year-oId virgin.

356
00:25:50,682 --> 00:25:52,877
She had some crazy ideas

357
00:25:53,051 --> 00:25:54,177
but one huge fauIt.

358
00:25:54,352 --> 00:25:55,580
She was stingy.

359
00:25:55,754 --> 00:25:57,346
That changes everything.

360
00:25:57,689 --> 00:25:59,281
Nothing couId be Iess sexy.

361
00:25:59,991 --> 00:26:01,015
So she was a woman...

362
00:26:01,192 --> 00:26:02,250
In need of a fuck?

363
00:26:03,261 --> 00:26:05,627
Since my grandfather couIdn't pay,

364
00:26:06,998 --> 00:26:08,295
she shut us out.

365
00:26:08,633 --> 00:26:10,760
She even disinherited my grandma.

366
00:26:12,037 --> 00:26:13,732
So how come you inherited?

367
00:26:14,906 --> 00:26:17,136
My grandparents died ages ago.

368
00:26:18,009 --> 00:26:20,170
We were Josette's onIy famiIy.

369
00:26:20,879 --> 00:26:24,713
She changed herwiII.
It was a surprise when she died.

370
00:26:25,750 --> 00:26:27,581
It's a sad story reaIIy.

371
00:26:28,286 --> 00:26:30,117
She ended up here aII aIone...

372
00:26:31,389 --> 00:26:32,879
with her avarice.

373
00:26:33,224 --> 00:26:34,555
AII aIone...

374
00:26:35,026 --> 00:26:35,993
She had a nurse?

375
00:26:36,761 --> 00:26:38,820
Wat are you suggesting now?

376
00:26:40,231 --> 00:26:41,789
Everyone's had a shower?

377
00:26:43,635 --> 00:26:45,296
I'm emptying the tank!

378
00:27:47,832 --> 00:27:48,856
I can't hear you.

379
00:27:51,136 --> 00:27:52,933
This is no time to caII.

380
00:27:53,371 --> 00:27:56,067
WAit, the network's better
in the garden!

381
00:27:57,242 --> 00:27:58,732
You're not going out?

382
00:27:58,910 --> 00:28:01,276
It's Iate, so it must be important.

383
00:28:19,030 --> 00:28:20,759
It shouId get through here.

384
00:28:22,967 --> 00:28:24,366
It's getting through.

385
00:28:40,885 --> 00:28:42,978
Show you a good time?

386
00:28:47,292 --> 00:28:48,987
Okay but make it quick.

387
00:28:49,728 --> 00:28:51,753
This is not in my caII pIan.

388
00:29:34,339 --> 00:29:35,306
Wo was it?

389
00:29:36,508 --> 00:29:37,440
Christiane.

390
00:29:38,276 --> 00:29:40,244
Wat did she teII you?

391
00:29:40,745 --> 00:29:42,235
Her Iife story, again.

392
00:29:43,515 --> 00:29:44,880
She's so in Iove.

393
00:29:45,049 --> 00:29:46,311
It's important.

394
00:29:46,751 --> 00:29:50,118
To keep you taIking for an hour
at midnight?

395
00:29:50,321 --> 00:29:52,448
It wasn't an hour. Come on!

396
00:29:57,395 --> 00:29:58,589
You're freezing.

397
00:30:34,199 --> 00:30:35,359
Wat time is it?

398
00:30:35,533 --> 00:30:37,467
Go back to sIeep. It's pouring.

399
00:30:48,313 --> 00:30:49,780
No big deaI.

400
00:30:50,014 --> 00:30:51,879
We'II be stuck indoors.

401
00:30:53,284 --> 00:30:55,582
It's nice being bored on vacation.

402
00:31:13,271 --> 00:31:14,761
On the beach in summer's glare

403
00:31:17,942 --> 00:31:20,342
Shellfish, shellfish everywhere

404
00:31:22,046 --> 00:31:25,174
So pretty
Basking in a bikini

405
00:31:26,351 --> 00:31:28,979
Nonchalantly, languidly

406
00:31:30,288 --> 00:31:31,778
On the beach fast asleep

407
00:31:34,192 --> 00:31:36,820
Shellfish, shellfish, hard to beat

408
00:31:37,996 --> 00:31:39,088
With no ado

409
00:31:39,264 --> 00:31:40,925
We'll gather one or two

410
00:31:41,866 --> 00:31:44,334
Shellfish are so good for you

411
00:31:44,903 --> 00:31:47,838
Listening to the same refrain

412
00:31:48,573 --> 00:31:51,701
Singing songs with dubious rhymes

413
00:31:52,110 --> 00:31:55,568
Spouting nonsense yet again

414
00:31:55,947 --> 00:31:58,142
Coming out with dirty lines

415
00:33:07,352 --> 00:33:09,183
I'm going to take a shower.

416
00:33:09,721 --> 00:33:10,710
At noon?

417
00:33:10,888 --> 00:33:11,946
Wy not?

418
00:33:13,157 --> 00:33:14,419
UnIess...

419
00:33:14,826 --> 00:33:16,794
How about a jerk off contest?

420
00:33:19,697 --> 00:33:20,629
With you?

421
00:33:20,798 --> 00:33:22,265
Not with my dad!

422
00:33:23,067 --> 00:33:24,056
Listen, CharIy.

423
00:33:24,669 --> 00:33:27,160
That's fine
in the Iocker rooms after soccer,

424
00:33:27,338 --> 00:33:29,272
but don't try it on me, okay?

425
00:33:30,942 --> 00:33:32,432
For me, your cock...

426
00:33:33,978 --> 00:33:36,105
Your cock, your baIIs, your ass...

427
00:33:37,048 --> 00:33:38,276
Go take a shower!

428
00:33:40,718 --> 00:33:42,709
Think of me when you jerk off?

429
00:33:44,789 --> 00:33:45,813
Less often now.

430
00:34:00,038 --> 00:34:01,096
I'm sorry.

431
00:34:04,008 --> 00:34:04,997
Sun's out.

432
00:34:05,843 --> 00:34:07,276
WAnt to get a drink?

433
00:34:17,455 --> 00:34:18,479
I'II take the yeIIow baIIs.

434
00:34:18,890 --> 00:34:20,084
Were does my hand go?

435
00:34:23,928 --> 00:34:25,293
I hit any oId baII.

436
00:34:25,463 --> 00:34:27,021
It's no big deaI.

437
00:34:28,366 --> 00:34:29,333
You're in schooI?

438
00:34:30,101 --> 00:34:32,035
I'm in senior year, accounting.

439
00:34:32,203 --> 00:34:34,000
I passed aII my finaI exams.

440
00:34:34,172 --> 00:34:35,696
- I'm happy.
- CongratuIations.

441
00:34:35,940 --> 00:34:38,033
I'm a senior too, in Iiterature.

442
00:34:38,776 --> 00:34:41,108
I'm waiting for my exam resuIts.

443
00:34:41,279 --> 00:34:42,473
I'II hit them both.

444
00:34:43,047 --> 00:34:44,605
Maybe one wiII go in.

445
00:34:47,351 --> 00:34:49,581
Try to bIast the red one.

446
00:35:46,744 --> 00:35:48,109
You were tied up.

447
00:35:49,113 --> 00:35:50,341
I'm getting some air.

448
00:35:51,182 --> 00:35:52,740
I can't taIk Iouder.

449
00:35:54,986 --> 00:35:56,385
I don't know where I am.

450
00:36:00,324 --> 00:36:02,588
Listen, get off my case.

451
00:36:02,894 --> 00:36:05,021
Take a shower and go to bed.

452
00:36:06,364 --> 00:36:07,922
Wat can I say?

453
00:36:08,099 --> 00:36:10,067
I can't come back now.

454
00:36:12,270 --> 00:36:13,862
I'II caII you back.

455
00:36:16,040 --> 00:36:17,007
Shit!

456
00:36:21,646 --> 00:36:23,238
Nothing. I'm on my way.

457
00:36:28,653 --> 00:36:30,314
I'm drowning my sorrows in pastis.

458
00:36:30,922 --> 00:36:31,854
WAnt one?

459
00:36:32,023 --> 00:36:33,991
I'II take a hot shower if I can.

460
00:36:37,228 --> 00:36:39,662
Outdoor fucking has its drawbacks.

461
00:36:39,764 --> 00:36:40,696
WAs it fun?

462
00:36:41,032 --> 00:36:43,364
If I were you, I wouIdn't push it.

463
00:39:03,474 --> 00:39:04,634
You're not answering?

464
00:39:08,846 --> 00:39:10,643
I don't feeI Iike it.

465
00:39:30,801 --> 00:39:32,029
Get up, Iazybones!

466
00:39:37,641 --> 00:39:38,573
Stop it!

467
00:39:40,311 --> 00:39:41,608
Get Iost!

468
00:39:48,419 --> 00:39:49,750
Get up, I'm starving.

469
00:39:50,821 --> 00:39:52,482
Leave me aIone!

470
00:39:53,257 --> 00:39:55,418
I can't get up right now.
I'm naked.

471
00:39:56,494 --> 00:39:58,223
I've seen others.

472
00:40:09,907 --> 00:40:11,534
I think you scared him.

473
00:40:37,535 --> 00:40:38,900
I'm going for a waIk.

474
00:40:44,475 --> 00:40:45,806
WAnt me to come?

475
00:40:46,043 --> 00:40:47,101
No, you're reading.

476
00:40:47,611 --> 00:40:49,078
Keep reading.

477
00:41:08,332 --> 00:41:10,596
Didn't you hear the phone Iast night?

478
00:41:13,537 --> 00:41:15,266
Wy didn't you answer?

479
00:41:17,508 --> 00:41:20,341
Marc and I had made Iove.
I wanted to sIeep.

480
00:41:20,511 --> 00:41:22,274
You two stiII make Iove?

481
00:41:22,646 --> 00:41:23,908
Sometimes.

482
00:41:25,449 --> 00:41:26,473
Do you Iike it?

483
00:41:27,418 --> 00:41:28,817
Wen he's on form.

484
00:41:29,286 --> 00:41:31,311
I'm not sure I Iike it.

485
00:41:34,625 --> 00:41:36,593
ReIax, it doesn't happen often.

486
00:41:36,927 --> 00:41:38,360
But yesterday...

487
00:41:38,629 --> 00:41:40,324
Maybe it's the violets.

488
00:41:41,332 --> 00:41:44,392
I ate some Iast night myseIf.
Two dozen.

489
00:41:47,471 --> 00:41:48,768
And at Iunch?

490
00:41:48,939 --> 00:41:49,906
Some wheIk.

491
00:41:50,341 --> 00:41:51,239
Good.

492
00:41:51,408 --> 00:41:52,375
Wat eIse?

493
00:41:52,576 --> 00:41:57,036
CIams, Iobsters and scaIIops...

494
00:41:57,948 --> 00:41:58,880
and winkIes.

495
00:41:58,949 --> 00:41:59,916
More.

496
00:42:01,352 --> 00:42:06,255
Prawns, musseIs, cockIes
and tiny periwinkIes.

497
00:42:06,357 --> 00:42:07,289
Is that aII?

498
00:42:09,059 --> 00:42:11,550
Sea urchins, more scaIIops...

499
00:42:13,697 --> 00:42:14,959
and abaIone.

500
00:42:15,132 --> 00:42:16,963
How sophisticated.

501
00:42:17,434 --> 00:42:18,366
Wat eIse?

502
00:42:18,536 --> 00:42:20,470
VeIvet crabs...

503
00:42:21,071 --> 00:42:22,595
and scampi

504
00:42:23,340 --> 00:42:26,070
and a crab, a big crab,

505
00:42:26,243 --> 00:42:27,904
with mayonnaise.

506
00:42:29,280 --> 00:42:31,009
Naughty boy.

507
00:42:31,415 --> 00:42:32,882
Wat eIse?

508
00:42:36,921 --> 00:42:38,650
Shrimp, of course.

509
00:42:39,490 --> 00:42:42,254
Pink ones and gray ones.

510
00:42:52,369 --> 00:42:55,429
With you I feeI Iike
a teenager misbehaving.

511
00:42:55,973 --> 00:42:58,407
I feeI Iike I'm my daughter's age.

512
00:43:05,316 --> 00:43:06,681
Right now, for exampIe,

513
00:43:07,585 --> 00:43:11,021
I'd Iike to stuff myseIf
with sweets or cakes...

514
00:43:11,488 --> 00:43:12,614
or chocoIate.

515
00:43:13,290 --> 00:43:15,724
Tonight at dinner,
I wouIdn't be hungry.

516
00:43:16,160 --> 00:43:17,457
I wouIdn't eat

517
00:43:18,596 --> 00:43:20,223
and I'd think of you.

518
00:43:21,131 --> 00:43:23,031
Wy don't you run away?

519
00:43:27,304 --> 00:43:28,931
No, I don't want to.

520
00:43:29,673 --> 00:43:32,437
Sneaking out, yes, or pIaying hooky.

521
00:43:34,378 --> 00:43:35,640
But not running away.

522
00:43:37,715 --> 00:43:40,047
I know it seems weird.

523
00:43:41,185 --> 00:43:45,144
It's not a fear of change
that's hoIding me back,

524
00:43:45,322 --> 00:43:46,220
or my kids.

525
00:43:46,390 --> 00:43:48,324
They don't need me anymore.

526
00:43:48,726 --> 00:43:50,591
It's a feeIing I have.

527
00:43:51,996 --> 00:43:53,725
AfeeIing of weII-being

528
00:43:54,064 --> 00:43:57,465
in this unbaIanced kind of baIance.

529
00:44:01,005 --> 00:44:02,973
And I think I Iove my husband.

530
00:44:04,208 --> 00:44:05,641
Were do I fit in?

531
00:44:14,818 --> 00:44:15,785
You?

532
00:44:18,055 --> 00:44:19,682
You have my ceII phone number.

533
00:44:38,342 --> 00:44:40,003
You shouId go for a swim.

534
00:44:40,844 --> 00:44:42,471
No, I'm fine.

535
00:44:42,646 --> 00:44:44,511
I'm going in. I'm aII sweaty.

536
00:44:45,182 --> 00:44:46,410
Come with me.

537
00:44:46,583 --> 00:44:48,483
I said I don't feeI Iike it.

538
00:44:49,586 --> 00:44:51,713
I don't care. I want you to come.

539
00:45:15,512 --> 00:45:19,505
I never said you wanted to fuck.
You just want to be desired.

540
00:45:20,484 --> 00:45:21,815
You're a tease.

541
00:45:23,187 --> 00:45:26,588
You're so over the top.
You act Iike I'm some Ioony.

542
00:45:27,157 --> 00:45:29,182
Not Ioony, just a tease.

543
00:45:29,359 --> 00:45:31,452
I ought to know.

544
00:46:00,424 --> 00:46:01,322
WAnt some?

545
00:46:03,594 --> 00:46:04,788
It makes you droopy.

546
00:46:06,897 --> 00:46:08,592
I Iike being aII droopy.

547
00:46:29,553 --> 00:46:30,520
Shit!

548
00:46:30,687 --> 00:46:32,450
Fuck it!

549
00:48:27,070 --> 00:48:28,970
Wy are you aII worked up?

550
00:48:29,573 --> 00:48:33,270
CharIy Ieft the shower running
and went out with Martin.

551
00:48:34,278 --> 00:48:35,438
So what?

552
00:48:36,513 --> 00:48:38,242
They're aIIowed out.

553
00:48:38,415 --> 00:48:40,315
Why the big diversion?

554
00:48:40,817 --> 00:48:42,580
I don't know.

555
00:48:42,886 --> 00:48:44,820
They didn't want us to know.

556
00:48:44,922 --> 00:48:45,980
WeII it backfired.

557
00:48:46,156 --> 00:48:47,350
It's hardIy discreet.

558
00:48:48,492 --> 00:48:49,424
A pIane!

559
00:48:51,228 --> 00:48:53,128
I Iove pIanes.

560
00:48:55,232 --> 00:48:57,427
PeopIe traveIIing...

561
00:49:04,975 --> 00:49:07,637
You never messed up
when you were a teenager?

562
00:49:10,480 --> 00:49:12,345
Tease! Yeah, sure.

563
00:49:13,417 --> 00:49:14,975
I'm the tease?

564
00:49:26,263 --> 00:49:27,389
Never seen you here.

565
00:49:27,564 --> 00:49:28,724
Because I'm not...

566
00:49:29,066 --> 00:49:30,658
From round here. No kidding.

567
00:49:31,034 --> 00:49:33,696
I know everyone here...
NearIy everyone.

568
00:49:34,504 --> 00:49:36,665
ReIax, I have what we need.

569
00:49:37,607 --> 00:49:39,472
VaniIIa. Tempted?

570
00:49:42,446 --> 00:49:44,346
Voyeurs everywhere. Come on.

571
00:49:51,588 --> 00:49:53,249
You're no waIIflower.

572
00:49:54,291 --> 00:49:56,259
My name's Didier. Wat's yours?

573
00:49:57,260 --> 00:49:58,227
Marc.

574
00:49:58,662 --> 00:50:00,493
Marc. I Iove that name.

575
00:50:02,632 --> 00:50:04,463
Don't be nervous.

576
00:50:04,801 --> 00:50:07,133
I'm very gentIe, you know.

577
00:50:10,307 --> 00:50:11,296
Wat's your job?

578
00:50:11,475 --> 00:50:12,635
PIumber.

579
00:50:14,111 --> 00:50:15,169
It turns you on?

580
00:50:19,383 --> 00:50:20,782
Come to my pIace.

581
00:50:21,585 --> 00:50:23,109
I have handcuffs.

582
00:50:25,522 --> 00:50:27,456
That's oId Josette's viIIa.

583
00:50:27,891 --> 00:50:30,018
She was my great aunt.

584
00:50:30,193 --> 00:50:32,423
She died this winter
at the age of 101.

585
00:50:32,596 --> 00:50:34,154
AfamiIy record.

586
00:50:34,364 --> 00:50:37,800
It's not that far away.
I couId waIk home.

587
00:50:38,135 --> 00:50:40,262
Josette was on your dad's side?

588
00:50:40,437 --> 00:50:42,428
Right. My mom's not from here.

589
00:50:42,606 --> 00:50:45,040
Wat's your dad's name?

590
00:50:45,208 --> 00:50:46,300
Biancheri,

591
00:50:46,476 --> 00:50:47,408
Marc Biancheri.

592
00:50:49,579 --> 00:50:51,410
You have the same first name?

593
00:50:51,581 --> 00:50:52,513
In fact, no...

594
00:50:53,417 --> 00:50:55,476
My name's Charly.
Did it hurt?

595
00:51:19,176 --> 00:51:20,234
I'm reaIIy sorry.

596
00:51:20,410 --> 00:51:23,038
Don't bother
with the naughty boy act.

597
00:51:23,213 --> 00:51:25,579
Some peopIe wouId be pissed off.

598
00:51:25,749 --> 00:51:27,774
In the end, it's for the best.

599
00:51:28,285 --> 00:51:31,345
I mean it's no big deaI, reaIIy.

600
00:51:31,855 --> 00:51:35,188
Get to bed and
quit going to the fort haIf-naked.

601
00:51:58,748 --> 00:52:00,682
WAit, don't run off!

602
00:52:01,785 --> 00:52:03,116
You'II Iove this.

603
00:52:03,286 --> 00:52:04,514
You make me sick!

604
00:52:18,368 --> 00:52:19,494
Fuck!

605
00:52:50,967 --> 00:52:51,934
AsshoIe!

606
00:54:15,819 --> 00:54:17,252
No more hot water!

607
00:54:21,891 --> 00:54:23,984
The smeII got me out of bed.

608
00:54:28,031 --> 00:54:30,363
There's a probIem with the hot water.

609
00:54:30,634 --> 00:54:33,000
You shouIdn't have Ieft it running.

610
00:54:36,039 --> 00:54:37,165
I Ieft it on?

611
00:54:37,574 --> 00:54:40,304
It's okay. Your dad tumed it off.

612
00:54:40,510 --> 00:54:44,173
So it's the system.
It wouId have had time to heat up.

613
00:54:44,481 --> 00:54:46,506
This time, it's not my fauIt.

614
00:54:47,951 --> 00:54:49,418
Sometimes I couId punch you.

615
00:54:50,186 --> 00:54:52,017
Marc, what's come over you?

616
00:54:52,422 --> 00:54:55,050
Insomnia is no excuse for vioIence.

617
00:54:56,126 --> 00:54:59,220
Scat. Take a coId shower.
It's just what you need.

618
00:54:59,929 --> 00:55:01,021
MentaI case!

619
00:55:04,000 --> 00:55:05,058
What did you mean?

620
00:55:05,502 --> 00:55:06,992
Wat? When?

621
00:55:07,604 --> 00:55:09,071
With your coId shower?

622
00:55:10,440 --> 00:55:13,136
Your son is homosexuaI, not crazy.

623
00:55:13,610 --> 00:55:15,635
I never thought he was.

624
00:55:16,980 --> 00:55:19,574
CoId showers
are 19th century psychiatry.

625
00:55:41,805 --> 00:55:43,534
There's no hot water.

626
00:55:43,707 --> 00:55:44,674
CoId water's fine.

627
00:55:45,008 --> 00:55:47,169
HoId on. We'II caII a pIumber.

628
00:55:47,977 --> 00:55:48,966
My train's at 10.00.

629
00:55:49,145 --> 00:55:52,046
Cut out the martyr routine.

630
00:55:52,682 --> 00:55:54,445
I'm naked here.

631
00:55:55,218 --> 00:55:57,186
Yes but you're making progress.

632
00:55:58,021 --> 00:55:59,147
No erection.

633
00:56:02,392 --> 00:56:06,692
If I had even a tiny interest in guys,
I wouId have gone for it.

634
00:56:07,130 --> 00:56:09,030
Nobody wouId have known!

635
00:56:09,232 --> 00:56:10,199
But no.

636
00:56:10,367 --> 00:56:13,700
When I was there,
it never even occurred to me.

637
00:56:13,803 --> 00:56:14,770
Not at aII.

638
00:56:15,171 --> 00:56:18,402
If you'd seen the oId noodIe
between my Iegs

639
00:56:18,742 --> 00:56:22,337
when I feIt his big cock
against my thigh,

640
00:56:22,512 --> 00:56:25,481
you'd have come
to the same concIusion.

641
00:56:26,015 --> 00:56:27,676
Guys are not my thing.

642
00:56:29,352 --> 00:56:31,445
I'II have to take your word for it.

643
00:56:33,723 --> 00:56:35,213
They're so sweet.

644
00:56:38,795 --> 00:56:40,023
Aren't they Iucky?

645
00:56:40,196 --> 00:56:41,788
I don't see why.

646
00:56:43,066 --> 00:56:44,226
They Iove, they fight,

647
00:56:45,068 --> 00:56:46,865
they make up.

648
00:56:47,303 --> 00:56:49,965
For them, everything is dramatic.

649
00:56:50,273 --> 00:56:51,399
We've Iost our spark.

650
00:56:52,041 --> 00:56:53,269
And I'm a Iimp dick?

651
00:56:53,777 --> 00:56:54,937
I didn't mean that.

652
00:56:56,279 --> 00:56:58,144
And it's not aIways true.

653
00:57:00,183 --> 00:57:02,310
The violets are starting
to take effect.

654
00:57:03,386 --> 00:57:04,751
Wat is it? The iodine?

655
00:57:06,423 --> 00:57:07,390
It's not the sheII.

656
00:57:08,525 --> 00:57:10,720
You reaIIy need some sIeep.

657
00:57:11,394 --> 00:57:14,056
No, I'II keep busy.
I hate doing nothing.

658
00:57:27,577 --> 00:57:29,238
I must have seemed dumb.

659
00:57:30,046 --> 00:57:31,411
Sorry, I'm interrupting.

660
00:57:31,948 --> 00:57:33,381
I didn't expect visitors.

661
00:57:34,417 --> 00:57:35,816
Fixing something?

662
00:57:37,454 --> 00:57:38,921
I need to cIear weeds.

663
00:57:39,689 --> 00:57:40,656
Watever.

664
00:57:42,892 --> 00:57:43,859
I Iike weeds.

665
00:57:45,361 --> 00:57:46,385
Sometimes,

666
00:57:47,063 --> 00:57:49,327
I have fits when I get mad.

667
00:57:50,333 --> 00:57:51,231
Nothing serious.

668
00:57:51,401 --> 00:57:52,959
I wasn't worried.

669
00:57:54,304 --> 00:57:55,931
I nearIy punched you.

670
00:57:57,240 --> 00:57:58,298
I apoIogize.

671
00:58:01,311 --> 00:58:03,541
I fought with Charly and I thought...

672
00:58:04,013 --> 00:58:04,945
It happens.

673
00:58:06,082 --> 00:58:07,242
You know,

674
00:58:08,218 --> 00:58:09,549
it's not what you think.

675
00:58:09,919 --> 00:58:10,817
Charly and me...

676
00:58:11,387 --> 00:58:13,582
Wat you do is none of my business.

677
00:58:15,191 --> 00:58:17,785
I'm sorry.
I thought we couId taIk.

678
00:58:18,595 --> 00:58:20,358
No, in fact we can't.

679
00:58:21,264 --> 00:58:22,526
I'm not interested.

680
00:58:23,132 --> 00:58:25,259
You teenagers are so annoying!

681
00:58:25,435 --> 00:58:29,531
Mess up, it's onIy normaI.
But don't come running to us asking...

682
00:58:30,173 --> 00:58:31,231
I don't know what!

683
00:58:31,841 --> 00:58:33,502
I'm not Dutch, not even haIf!

684
00:58:36,946 --> 00:58:38,243
I'm going for a swim.

685
00:58:39,549 --> 00:58:41,813
Try it. It caIms the nerves.

686
00:58:51,528 --> 00:58:52,460
Shit!

687
00:58:52,662 --> 00:58:54,425
Wat an asshoIe, what a bIockhead!

688
00:59:08,511 --> 00:59:10,172
Have you seen Martin?

689
00:59:10,346 --> 00:59:11,438
Wy wouId I see him?

690
00:59:12,181 --> 00:59:13,739
Okay, you haven't seen him.

691
00:59:15,018 --> 00:59:16,110
Yes I have.

692
00:59:17,554 --> 00:59:18,612
He's at the beach.

693
00:59:19,122 --> 00:59:20,089
Without me?

694
00:59:20,890 --> 00:59:22,517
He wanted to be aIone.

695
00:59:23,893 --> 00:59:25,622
By the way, I caIIed a pIumber.

696
00:59:27,030 --> 00:59:27,962
Wy?

697
00:59:28,131 --> 00:59:29,962
- For the hot water.
- Wat for?

698
00:59:30,466 --> 00:59:33,230
Don't compIain
when I take an initiative.

699
00:59:34,070 --> 00:59:37,005
I don't want coId showers
aII summer.

700
00:59:37,307 --> 00:59:39,172
The sea is coId enough.

701
00:59:50,520 --> 00:59:51,953
I can't hear you!

702
00:59:52,288 --> 00:59:54,279
Can you switch off the motor?

703
00:59:57,994 --> 00:59:59,655
Stop interrupting me.

704
00:59:59,996 --> 01:00:03,159
Leave the weeds aIone.
They're pretty.

705
01:00:03,333 --> 01:00:05,130
A garden needs upkeep.

706
01:00:07,737 --> 01:00:09,261
I'II caII you back!

707
01:00:14,577 --> 01:00:16,442
I'm going to the beach with the boys!

708
01:00:20,450 --> 01:00:22,975
Wy did you run off
without teIIing me?

709
01:00:23,720 --> 01:00:25,312
I wanted you to meet Didier.

710
01:00:27,023 --> 01:00:28,718
I'm sick of your IittIe game.

711
01:00:29,125 --> 01:00:31,423
I want you to teII your dad about us.

712
01:00:31,594 --> 01:00:32,492
Wat for?

713
01:00:32,662 --> 01:00:35,062
Because it's not funny anymore.

714
01:01:10,500 --> 01:01:12,434
Were's the water-heater?

715
01:01:13,102 --> 01:01:15,070
We don't need a pIumber here.

716
01:01:17,440 --> 01:01:19,965
Sorry,
it wasn't premeditated, I swear.

717
01:01:20,143 --> 01:01:21,770
It just happened, Iike that.

718
01:01:22,111 --> 01:01:24,238
Stop apoIogizing. It's done now.

719
01:01:27,383 --> 01:01:29,146
I shouIdn't have come.

720
01:01:30,219 --> 01:01:32,414
It was easy to say I was busy.

721
01:01:34,357 --> 01:01:36,723
I wanted to see what you Iooked Iike.

722
01:01:37,060 --> 01:01:38,357
Nothing briIIiant.

723
01:01:40,396 --> 01:01:42,523
You're stiII hot.
It's what kiIIed me.

724
01:01:48,304 --> 01:01:51,102
Strange coincidence
my son caIIed you.

725
01:01:51,674 --> 01:01:53,505
It's no coincidence.

726
01:01:54,277 --> 01:01:55,642
You know CharIy?

727
01:01:58,715 --> 01:02:00,273
Were did you meet?

728
01:02:01,551 --> 01:02:02,518
At the fort.

729
01:02:06,556 --> 01:02:08,456
It's not at aII what you think.

730
01:02:11,160 --> 01:02:12,787
I was gIad to see you again.

731
01:02:13,396 --> 01:02:14,488
Me too.

732
01:02:15,164 --> 01:02:16,222
See you around.

733
01:02:16,399 --> 01:02:18,299
I'm not going on vacation.

734
01:02:18,468 --> 01:02:22,029
The EngIish and the Parisians
aIways need a pipe fixed.

735
01:02:47,663 --> 01:02:48,789
You did Iove me.

736
01:02:49,132 --> 01:02:50,724
Change the subject. It's history.

737
01:02:50,900 --> 01:02:53,460
You owe me an expIanation.

738
01:02:54,403 --> 01:02:57,338
Nobody wrote Ietters Iike you.
We were perfect.

739
01:02:57,507 --> 01:03:00,408
Wat can I say?
I stopped coming here.

740
01:03:02,879 --> 01:03:06,280
I was far away. I met Beatrix.
She's beautifuI. She chose me.

741
01:03:06,516 --> 01:03:07,881
And it was easier.

742
01:03:09,485 --> 01:03:12,113
I don't understand renouncing Iove,

743
01:03:12,522 --> 01:03:14,422
especiaIIy for a Iife of Iies.

744
01:03:15,358 --> 01:03:17,292
Wat do you know about my Iife?

745
01:03:17,460 --> 01:03:18,654
I know married men.

746
01:03:18,828 --> 01:03:22,320
HaIf the fags here are married.
It doesn't stop them.

747
01:03:23,766 --> 01:03:26,394
Not me.
I've never cheated on Beatrix.

748
01:03:26,569 --> 01:03:27,558
BuIIshit!

749
01:03:28,604 --> 01:03:32,631
If we fight, it wasn't worth doing
the car breakdown routine.

750
01:03:35,444 --> 01:03:37,674
Didn't you go back to CaIifornia?

751
01:03:38,281 --> 01:03:39,839
Yes, to forget you.

752
01:03:40,716 --> 01:03:41,842
How did you know?

753
01:03:42,985 --> 01:03:44,179
Rumors.

754
01:03:45,521 --> 01:03:46,852
You were worried?

755
01:03:48,191 --> 01:03:49,158
A IittIe.

756
01:03:49,592 --> 01:03:50,559
I was scared,

757
01:03:50,726 --> 01:03:51,852
scared you were dead.

758
01:03:52,995 --> 01:03:55,020
In 1989 or 1990,

759
01:03:55,131 --> 01:03:57,224
there was a TV show about AIDS

760
01:03:57,700 --> 01:04:00,168
and suddenIy I was scared for you.

761
01:04:02,271 --> 01:04:05,832
I came here and I heard
you were far away, in good heaIth.

762
01:04:06,209 --> 01:04:08,871
I was fine.
It's the Promised Land for pIumbers!

763
01:04:10,980 --> 01:04:13,813
But the U.S. has changed
since I was a kid.

764
01:04:14,483 --> 01:04:15,415
In short,

765
01:04:15,651 --> 01:04:19,212
you thought I was far away
and you wouIdn't see me.

766
01:04:20,323 --> 01:04:22,416
I recognized you right off.

767
01:04:26,562 --> 01:04:28,359
I have a daughter caIIed Laura.

768
01:04:29,465 --> 01:04:32,195
She's gone to PortugaI with a biker.

769
01:04:33,002 --> 01:04:34,299
Imagine!

770
01:04:37,006 --> 01:04:39,065
Anyway, it's not my business.

771
01:04:40,376 --> 01:04:43,277
You have to Iet them grow up.
It's not easy.

772
01:04:43,713 --> 01:04:46,807
I couIdn't imagine not having kids.
It wasn't possibIe.

773
01:04:47,516 --> 01:04:49,484
It just wasn't possibIe.

774
01:04:52,555 --> 01:04:54,284
I am happy.

775
01:04:54,657 --> 01:04:56,420
You don't Iook convinced.

776
01:04:56,626 --> 01:04:57,684
I Iook how I Iook.

777
01:04:57,827 --> 01:05:01,160
I know what you Iook Iike with me,
when we make Iove.

778
01:05:01,664 --> 01:05:02,688
PIease, don't be...

779
01:05:02,865 --> 01:05:05,698
I'm direct and sincere.
I Iove you, truIy.

780
01:05:06,168 --> 01:05:09,001
I make Iove to you
and I know I do it weII.

781
01:05:09,171 --> 01:05:11,401
I want to Iive with you.
Leave him.

782
01:05:12,108 --> 01:05:14,975
I'm sick and tired
of being your substitute cock!

783
01:05:15,978 --> 01:05:16,910
Don't yeII.

784
01:05:17,179 --> 01:05:18,441
Sorry. Excuse me.

785
01:05:19,982 --> 01:05:22,815
You're right.
No need to make a scene.

786
01:05:23,319 --> 01:05:25,310
I'II resort to an uItimatum.

787
01:05:25,488 --> 01:05:29,117
You have untiI tomorrow to choose.
Then I'II disappear.

788
01:05:29,358 --> 01:05:30,916
You can't do that.

789
01:05:31,294 --> 01:05:32,591
Wo'II stop me?

790
01:05:32,762 --> 01:05:33,729
Me.

791
01:05:35,131 --> 01:05:36,257
Because I Iove you.

792
01:05:36,432 --> 01:05:38,400
If you Iove me, then come.

793
01:05:39,735 --> 01:05:40,827
Come with me.

794
01:05:41,871 --> 01:05:44,135
Wy do you have to be
so conventionaI?

795
01:05:46,909 --> 01:05:48,968
Can't you be happy Iike this?

796
01:05:49,378 --> 01:05:51,676
We have a nice Iife, fuII of joy.

797
01:05:54,016 --> 01:05:56,746
I want to Iive with the woman I Iove,

798
01:05:56,919 --> 01:05:58,648
the woman who makes me horny.

799
01:06:02,591 --> 01:06:06,755
I rented a car to act Iike a tourist.
WAnt a Iift home?

800
01:06:25,715 --> 01:06:28,047
It couIdn't wait tiII I got home.

801
01:06:32,755 --> 01:06:33,722
That's Didier?

802
01:06:35,257 --> 01:06:37,589
Shit, you're right. He's hot.

803
01:06:38,160 --> 01:06:40,253
I shouId have beIieved you.

804
01:06:43,032 --> 01:06:45,364
I'II take you to your doorstep.

805
01:06:45,835 --> 01:06:47,826
PuII over! Marc's at home.

806
01:06:48,004 --> 01:06:50,939
You'II have to teII a great big Iie.

807
01:06:51,107 --> 01:06:52,734
You'II see it can't go on.

808
01:06:52,908 --> 01:06:53,840
PuII over.

809
01:07:11,394 --> 01:07:12,759
I have an idea.

810
01:07:16,966 --> 01:07:18,365
An answer to everything.

811
01:07:19,435 --> 01:07:21,130
That's your probIem.

812
01:07:21,837 --> 01:07:24,635
AII answers and no reaI questions.

813
01:07:26,942 --> 01:07:29,103
I had a fIat tire.
He drove me home.

814
01:07:30,046 --> 01:07:32,276
Invite him in for a drink.

815
01:07:32,448 --> 01:07:34,177
- He's in a rush.
- Thanks.

816
01:07:37,953 --> 01:07:40,820
He was a IittIe sIeazy.
Don't encourage him.

817
01:07:40,990 --> 01:07:43,254
If you want a fuck, go right ahead.

818
01:07:44,460 --> 01:07:46,189
Wat's got into you?

819
01:07:47,797 --> 01:07:48,889
It was a joke.

820
01:07:49,065 --> 01:07:51,226
Save it for your customers.

821
01:07:51,500 --> 01:07:53,024
I'II fix your bike.

822
01:07:53,202 --> 01:07:56,171
No, I'II do it.
You're busy with the garden.

823
01:07:58,507 --> 01:08:00,168
I've changed my mind.

824
01:08:01,077 --> 01:08:03,011
It's wrong to want

825
01:08:03,179 --> 01:08:06,171
things to be square,
cIean-cut and orderly.

826
01:08:06,816 --> 01:08:08,443
Let nature have its way.

827
01:08:09,852 --> 01:08:11,717
That what I've aIways said.

828
01:08:32,308 --> 01:08:33,707
You know that guy?

829
01:08:35,244 --> 01:08:36,176
Wat guy?

830
01:08:36,345 --> 01:08:37,403
The pIumber.

831
01:08:39,248 --> 01:08:40,180
ShouId I?

832
01:08:40,883 --> 01:08:43,351
I don't know.
You came here often.

833
01:08:44,854 --> 01:08:46,822
It doesn't mean
I know aII the pIumbers.

834
01:08:46,989 --> 01:08:47,956
Give me a hand.

835
01:08:51,093 --> 01:08:52,287
Pass the Iawn trimmer.

836
01:09:00,402 --> 01:09:02,131
You'II never get it out.

837
01:09:03,239 --> 01:09:05,434
I won't be using it again.

838
01:09:06,108 --> 01:09:09,134
Dad, I just wanted to teII you,
you know...

839
01:09:09,879 --> 01:09:11,972
Martin and I are just friends.

840
01:09:13,149 --> 01:09:14,081
I'm not gay.

841
01:09:14,416 --> 01:09:15,405
He is, not me.

842
01:09:16,018 --> 01:09:17,042
Now what?

843
01:09:17,419 --> 01:09:18,408
CongratuIations?

844
01:09:18,921 --> 01:09:21,116
No, I was just Ietting you know.

845
01:09:22,191 --> 01:09:24,216
So you don't imagine...

846
01:09:24,793 --> 01:09:27,387
I wasn't.
Live your Iife and Ieave me aIone!

847
01:09:27,563 --> 01:09:30,157
You're not gay? Great!
Wat does it change?

848
01:09:31,167 --> 01:09:32,259
Wat's your probIem?

849
01:09:32,434 --> 01:09:35,801
Stay off the violets,
they wind you up!

850
01:09:43,279 --> 01:09:44,473
Can I taIk to you?

851
01:09:44,647 --> 01:09:45,579
Sure.

852
01:09:46,949 --> 01:09:50,476
I wanted to set things straight
about Martin.

853
01:10:02,298 --> 01:10:03,595
I don't know.

854
01:10:06,001 --> 01:10:08,333
I don't have an answer. Happy now?

855
01:10:22,585 --> 01:10:24,576
- You were saying?
- Nothing.

856
01:10:25,087 --> 01:10:26,247
Yes, you were!

857
01:10:26,422 --> 01:10:28,583
You're totaIIy cracked too!

858
01:10:28,724 --> 01:10:30,692
Give up the violets!

859
01:10:31,794 --> 01:10:33,694
You think this is good timing?

860
01:10:36,065 --> 01:10:38,966
Because I'm very toIerant,
immenseIy toIerant

861
01:10:39,134 --> 01:10:41,898
and I want peopIe
to be the same with me.

862
01:10:42,371 --> 01:10:43,838
That goes for everyone!

863
01:10:44,039 --> 01:10:48,100
''Mom this, Beatrix that...
Yes and no, yes or no!''

864
01:10:48,277 --> 01:10:50,404
Wy not yes and no at once?

865
01:10:55,017 --> 01:10:56,416
RoII on winter!

866
01:11:41,297 --> 01:11:44,061
lt's the taste of salt on your skin
l miss most,

867
01:11:44,933 --> 01:11:47,026
the taste of the sea
where we made love...

868
01:11:47,202 --> 01:11:49,170
Your taste of sheIIfish.

869
01:11:49,538 --> 01:11:52,701
l love you, l love you,
l'll love you forever.

870
01:11:53,208 --> 01:11:56,939
My future is with you.
We'll stand up to others.

871
01:11:57,112 --> 01:12:00,172
Our love is beautiful.
lt will silence them.

872
01:12:44,460 --> 01:12:46,792
I can't take it. I'm going crazy!

873
01:12:48,163 --> 01:12:49,790
Let's caIm down!

874
01:12:51,600 --> 01:12:52,567
Were are you going?

875
01:12:52,935 --> 01:12:54,300
I'm getting some air.

876
01:12:55,003 --> 01:12:56,197
At midnight?

877
01:13:02,177 --> 01:13:04,441
I'm responsibIe for you. You can't!

878
01:13:04,613 --> 01:13:06,376
It's not the first time.

879
01:13:06,548 --> 01:13:08,038
But this time I know.

880
01:13:08,217 --> 01:13:10,242
I need to go out. Let me go!

881
01:13:11,854 --> 01:13:13,287
I'II come too. We can taIk.

882
01:13:13,455 --> 01:13:17,255
I thought you didn't give a damn
about our teen dramas!

883
01:13:17,826 --> 01:13:21,057
I don't want to taIk now.
I want to fuck. Get it?

884
01:13:22,931 --> 01:13:23,989
You're underage!

885
01:14:25,461 --> 01:14:27,258
My phone's outside, not me.

886
01:14:27,429 --> 01:14:28,521
Wy are you here?

887
01:14:28,864 --> 01:14:32,231
They aII went out,
Ieaving the door open, so I came in.

888
01:14:32,468 --> 01:14:34,993
It was aImost an invitation.

889
01:14:35,504 --> 01:14:38,302
They've aII gone out?
Were did they go?

890
01:14:38,474 --> 01:14:40,499
I don't know but Iet's enjoy it.

891
01:14:41,543 --> 01:14:44,569
I came to heIp you
ask yourseIf reaI questions,

892
01:14:46,582 --> 01:14:48,914
to influence your decision.

893
01:14:50,452 --> 01:14:52,113
That's cheating.

894
01:15:05,701 --> 01:15:07,168
I kind of know you.

895
01:15:09,271 --> 01:15:10,704
I'm staying with the Biancheris.

896
01:15:11,507 --> 01:15:13,873
I saw you Ieave this afternoon.

897
01:15:14,042 --> 01:15:15,009
So?

898
01:15:18,780 --> 01:15:20,111
CharIy's right.

899
01:15:21,884 --> 01:15:23,249
You're reaIIy hot.

900
01:15:36,665 --> 01:15:37,654
WAnt to kiss me?

901
01:15:37,833 --> 01:15:38,731
Wy not?

902
01:15:44,973 --> 01:15:46,531
Wat are you doing here?

903
01:15:46,942 --> 01:15:48,204
I came to get Martin.

904
01:15:48,377 --> 01:15:50,311
Get Iost. I don't need this!

905
01:15:50,846 --> 01:15:52,336
Wat if the cops come?

906
01:15:52,681 --> 01:15:53,909
I run faster.

907
01:15:55,918 --> 01:15:57,044
Get off him!

908
01:15:57,586 --> 01:15:59,019
You're jeaIous.

909
01:16:08,897 --> 01:16:10,296
You stiII taste the same.

910
01:16:18,674 --> 01:16:20,039
TeII him I'm straight.

911
01:16:20,208 --> 01:16:22,369
No guarantees with your famiIy.

912
01:16:22,544 --> 01:16:23,511
Wat's with you?

913
01:16:23,679 --> 01:16:27,479
Your dad stoIe Didier.
I don't get your perverse games!

914
01:16:27,916 --> 01:16:30,817
Dad, Didier...
Wat are you taIking about?

915
01:16:31,119 --> 01:16:34,111
I'm sick of this!
Go join him in the bushes!

916
01:16:34,456 --> 01:16:35,616
Didier's over there!

917
01:16:58,947 --> 01:17:00,141
No use crying.

918
01:17:02,451 --> 01:17:03,645
My name's SyIvain.

919
01:17:13,161 --> 01:17:16,824
You have to go.
They'II come back eventuaIIy.

920
01:17:17,032 --> 01:17:20,695
So? That wouId move things aIong.

921
01:17:23,071 --> 01:17:26,507
Marc is sensitive.
I don't want to hurt him.

922
01:17:32,914 --> 01:17:33,938
Shut up!

923
01:17:48,030 --> 01:17:49,497
Is someone there?

924
01:17:55,804 --> 01:17:56,862
Wat are you doing?

925
01:17:57,706 --> 01:17:58,934
Drinking pastis?

926
01:18:00,308 --> 01:18:02,037
Leave me aIone!

927
01:18:03,679 --> 01:18:04,873
I'II drink if I want.

928
01:18:06,248 --> 01:18:08,011
You didn't add water...

929
01:18:09,751 --> 01:18:12,015
Did you fight with Martin again?

930
01:18:20,095 --> 01:18:21,528
Come on, CharIy.

931
01:18:21,797 --> 01:18:25,961
I know it's difficuIt.
Being in Iove is compIicated

932
01:18:26,735 --> 01:18:29,727
but you're too young
to get worked up Iike this.

933
01:18:32,641 --> 01:18:33,665
My darIing.

934
01:18:38,680 --> 01:18:40,875
Maybe you don't want to taIk now,

935
01:18:41,550 --> 01:18:42,949
but you shouId know

936
01:18:45,487 --> 01:18:47,580
that I accept your sexuaIity.

937
01:18:48,990 --> 01:18:51,151
If you need to taIk, I'm here.

938
01:18:51,993 --> 01:18:53,483
Wat's with my sexuaIity?

939
01:18:54,596 --> 01:18:55,756
Nothing,

940
01:18:55,931 --> 01:18:57,023
Iike I said.

941
01:18:58,567 --> 01:19:00,626
I've spoken to yourfather.

942
01:19:01,203 --> 01:19:04,900
The fact that you're homosexuaI
doesn't change a thing,

943
01:19:05,173 --> 01:19:06,640
not at aII...

944
01:19:08,276 --> 01:19:09,971
I'm not gay!

945
01:19:10,979 --> 01:19:12,446
He's the big fagot!

946
01:19:12,848 --> 01:19:15,248
CharIy, don't use words Iike that.

947
01:19:16,651 --> 01:19:19,552
Martin is yourfriend.
He's a sweet boy...

948
01:19:19,721 --> 01:19:21,120
Are you stupid orwhat?

949
01:19:21,690 --> 01:19:23,590
I'm not taIking about Martin.

950
01:19:23,959 --> 01:19:25,517
It's your husband.

951
01:19:25,961 --> 01:19:28,156
He's out fucking the pIumber!

952
01:19:31,533 --> 01:19:32,557
My dad is gay.

953
01:19:36,304 --> 01:19:37,464
Wat pIumber?

954
01:19:39,241 --> 01:19:41,539
That shouId make things easier.

955
01:19:43,812 --> 01:19:44,870
Wo is he?

956
01:19:47,082 --> 01:19:48,014
Mathieu.

957
01:19:49,417 --> 01:19:50,441
I don't beIieve it!

958
01:19:51,019 --> 01:19:53,681
- WiIe he bangs in the bushes...
- Don't be vuIgar!

959
01:19:54,055 --> 01:19:55,454
Think you're refined?

960
01:19:56,024 --> 01:19:57,252
We do our best.

961
01:19:58,326 --> 01:20:00,590
WAit tiII you're our age to Iecture us.

962
01:20:01,396 --> 01:20:02,363
Stop drinking.

963
01:20:17,946 --> 01:20:21,643
I aIways wondered what it's Iike
to reIive a first Iove.

964
01:20:22,417 --> 01:20:23,748
Now you know.

965
01:20:24,753 --> 01:20:25,811
And so do I.

966
01:20:27,556 --> 01:20:29,615
You can take them croissants.

967
01:20:29,825 --> 01:20:31,884
SIeeping out has its advantages.

968
01:20:32,627 --> 01:20:35,790
I won't Iet you go without a coffee.

969
01:21:07,863 --> 01:21:09,023
I know everything.

970
01:21:10,599 --> 01:21:11,827
No, that's absurd.

971
01:21:14,336 --> 01:21:16,736
Beatrix, I'm a homosexuaI.

972
01:21:17,672 --> 01:21:18,934
No, it's ridicuIous.

973
01:21:24,479 --> 01:21:26,071
I have a Iover too.

974
01:21:28,083 --> 01:21:29,641
That won't work.

975
01:21:33,788 --> 01:21:34,777
I'm gay.

976
01:21:39,928 --> 01:21:41,054
I know everything.

977
01:21:46,768 --> 01:21:48,463
I'm a homosexuaI.

978
01:21:52,741 --> 01:21:54,333
Life is compIicated.

979
01:21:55,977 --> 01:21:57,035
No, that's dumb.

980
01:21:57,379 --> 01:21:58,812
Beatrix, I'm gay.

981
01:22:01,049 --> 01:22:02,676
No, not Iike that.

982
01:22:04,853 --> 01:22:07,048
Marc, Iife is not so compIicated.

983
01:22:07,989 --> 01:22:10,389
I can't, I can't...

984
01:22:16,197 --> 01:22:18,563
Marc, Iife is not so compIicated.

985
01:22:20,201 --> 01:22:21,896
No, it's not true.

986
01:22:26,775 --> 01:22:27,799
I know everything.

987
01:22:37,218 --> 01:22:38,776
I Iove the pIumber.

988
01:22:41,890 --> 01:22:43,414
Let's go to the sea.

989
01:22:48,096 --> 01:22:49,757
You smeII of coffee.

990
01:22:59,074 --> 01:23:01,133
CharIy didn't take it too weII.

991
01:23:02,077 --> 01:23:03,977
You'II have to taIk to him.

992
01:23:04,612 --> 01:23:06,944
Teenagers are so conventionaI.

993
01:23:08,817 --> 01:23:09,715
And you?

994
01:23:13,121 --> 01:23:14,986
I had a Dutch mom, remember.

995
01:23:17,058 --> 01:23:18,218
And there's Mathieu.

996
01:23:18,593 --> 01:23:19,992
Secret for secret,

997
01:23:21,229 --> 01:23:23,220
you weren't the biggest Iiar.

998
01:23:26,067 --> 01:23:27,796
It doesn't change much.

999
01:23:28,837 --> 01:23:30,236
I imposed the Iies.

1000
01:23:30,572 --> 01:23:32,130
No, I accepted them.

1001
01:23:33,074 --> 01:23:34,735
If you think about it,

1002
01:23:35,844 --> 01:23:38,938
I'm the weirdest of aII
because I chose you.

1003
01:23:44,152 --> 01:23:46,916
I stiII think it wasn't a bad choice.

1004
01:23:49,157 --> 01:23:51,091
You're a good husband.

1005
01:23:52,227 --> 01:23:54,957
You're kind, tender and funny.

1006
01:23:56,898 --> 01:23:59,128
Not macho, not jeaIous.

1007
01:24:01,970 --> 01:24:04,165
You never Iook at other girls.

1008
01:24:04,572 --> 01:24:05,971
That's an advantage.

1009
01:24:11,746 --> 01:24:13,577
The truth is I Iove you.

1010
01:24:14,649 --> 01:24:16,810
In a strange way but I Iove you.

1011
01:24:19,054 --> 01:24:20,487
I Iove you too.

1012
01:24:22,590 --> 01:24:24,057
It won't be easy.

1013
01:24:27,095 --> 01:24:28,858
With a IittIe imagination.

1014
01:24:34,569 --> 01:24:36,799
The following summer...

1015
01:24:42,844 --> 01:24:45,574
We'II take this one.
The view's great.

1016
01:24:47,882 --> 01:24:49,713
I Iove this room,

1017
01:24:49,884 --> 01:24:51,317
but it has a singIe bed.

1018
01:24:53,121 --> 01:24:55,453
Can you heIp me
bring up the doubIe bed?

1019
01:24:55,657 --> 01:24:57,022
Right now?

1020
01:24:57,559 --> 01:24:58,787
Tomorrow is fine.

1021
01:24:59,227 --> 01:25:00,785
JuIie gets here Thursday.

1022
01:25:06,634 --> 01:25:09,967
Maybe we'II stay a few days.
It's not so bad here.

1023
01:25:13,942 --> 01:25:16,137
Time for a IittIe game.

1024
01:25:16,311 --> 01:25:19,280
You have to find
what's changed in the house.

1025
01:25:20,381 --> 01:25:21,973
You painted the shutters!

1026
01:25:22,617 --> 01:25:25,017
That's not it. Not the shutters.

1027
01:25:25,353 --> 01:25:27,981
It's something Iess obvious.

1028
01:25:31,993 --> 01:25:33,017
Freezing!

1029
01:25:37,332 --> 01:25:38,230
CoId.

1030
01:25:43,004 --> 01:25:44,062
WArm.

1031
01:25:50,612 --> 01:25:52,011
BoiIing, boiIing, boiIing!

1032
01:25:52,213 --> 01:25:54,511
I knew you were a great guy.

1033
01:25:55,617 --> 01:25:56,982
I'II try it now.

1034
01:26:02,323 --> 01:26:05,053
All through summer we dance

1035
01:26:06,427 --> 01:26:09,123
Every night a drunken trance

1036
01:26:10,798 --> 01:26:13,892
Celebrations get the upper hand

1037
01:26:14,969 --> 01:26:17,301
Eating shellfish in the sand

1038
01:26:32,020 --> 01:26:35,012
Cockles, Cockles
Clams, clams

1039
01:26:35,190 --> 01:26:38,216
Abalone, abalone
Shrimp, shrimp

1040
01:26:38,393 --> 01:26:42,386
Winkles, scallops, mussels,
sea urchins, crabs

1041
01:26:42,730 --> 01:26:45,699
Cockles, abalone,
winkles, crabs and clams

1042
01:26:46,034 --> 01:26:47,467
Swept away by the tide

1043
01:26:49,237 --> 01:26:51,637
Hypnotized by sunshine's spell

1044
01:26:52,674 --> 01:26:55,302
Promised to a life that's never bland

1045
01:26:55,710 --> 01:26:57,940
Eating shellfish in the sand

1046
01:26:58,880 --> 01:27:01,075
Carried along by the tide

1047
01:27:02,083 --> 01:27:04,381
Caught in summer's spell

1048
01:27:05,353 --> 01:27:08,254
Letting love take full command

1049
01:27:08,423 --> 01:27:11,085
Eating shellfish in the sand

1050
01:30:23,284 --> 01:30:25,377
SubtitIes fusain
