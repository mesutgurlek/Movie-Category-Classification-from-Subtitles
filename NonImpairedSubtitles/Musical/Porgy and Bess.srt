1
00:02:11,472 --> 00:02:24,631
Summertime
and the livin' is easy,

2
00:02:24,917 --> 00:02:37,099
Fish are jumpin
and the cotton is high.

3
00:02:38,046 --> 00:02:50,030
Oh your daddy's rich
and your ma is good lookin',

4
00:02:51,726 --> 00:03:04,696
So hush, little baby,
don' yo' cry.

5
00:03:10,905 --> 00:03:24,099
One of these mornin's
you goin' to rise up singin',

6
00:03:24,976 --> 00:03:36,636
Then you'll spread yo' wings
an' you'll take the sky.

7
00:03:38,528 --> 00:03:50,827
But till that mornin'
there's a-nothin' can harm you

8
00:03:52,652 --> 00:04:07,549
With Daddy and Mammy standin' by.

9
00:04:07,752 --> 00:04:09,573
Give me my boy!

10
00:07:46,438 --> 00:07:57,353
Oh, nobody knows when
the Lawd is goin' to call.

11
00:07:57,388 --> 00:08:04,899
Roll dem bones, roll.

12
00:08:04,934 --> 00:08:16,657
It may be in the summertime
and maybe in the fall.

13
00:08:16,692 --> 00:08:23,962
Roll dem bones, roll.

14
00:08:23,997 --> 00:08:32,047
But you got to leave yo' baby
and yo' home an' all,

15
00:08:32,082 --> 00:08:36,599
So..  roll dem bones,

16
00:08:36,634 --> 00:08:47,269
oh, my brudder,
oh, my brudder,

17
00:08:47,304 --> 00:08:57,087
oh, my brudder,
roll dem bones,

18
00:08:57,122 --> 00:09:13,257
roll, roll.

19
00:09:56,808 --> 00:10:03,730
Seems like these bones don't give me
nothin' but boxcars tonight.

20
00:10:03,765 --> 00:10:10,415
It was the same two weeks ago,
an' the game broke me;

21
00:10:10,450 --> 00:10:13,392
I don't likes that kind o' luck!

22
00:10:21,075 --> 00:10:23,974
Damn you, give me dem bones!

23
00:10:24,009 --> 00:10:28,066
What do you say to these, Jake?

24
00:10:28,101 --> 00:10:31,591
Them's the same cock-eyed bones

25
00:10:31,626 --> 00:10:35,553
what clean the game out
last Saturday night;

26
00:10:35,588 --> 00:10:39,001
If they rolls in this game,

27
00:10:39,036 --> 00:10:45,862
I rolls out

28
00:10:47,611 --> 00:10:50,448
Honey boy!

29
00:10:50,483 --> 00:10:53,490
Come on down, Robbins,
we're waiting for you.

30
00:10:53,525 --> 00:10:58,957
Honey, don't play tonight.
Do like I say.

31
00:10:58,992 --> 00:11:03,625
I been sweatin' all day.

32
00:11:03,660 --> 00:11:07,108
Night time is man's time.

33
00:11:07,143 --> 00:11:12,090
He got a right to forget his troubles.

34
00:11:12,125 --> 00:11:17,373
He got a right to play.

35
00:11:17,408 --> 00:11:20,254
If you hadn't been drinkin'

36
00:11:20,289 --> 00:11:23,813
you wouldn't talk to me that way.

37
00:11:23,848 --> 00:11:28,813
You ain't nebber hear
Lord Jesus say nuttin'

38
00:11:28,848 --> 00:11:32,007
'bout got to play.

39
00:11:32,042 --> 00:11:35,247
There you go again.

40
00:11:35,282 --> 00:11:37,484
Lissen what I say.

41
00:11:37,519 --> 00:11:42,221
I works all the week;

42
00:11:42,256 --> 00:11:44,542
Sunday got to pray.

43
00:11:44,577 --> 00:11:46,776
But Saturday night

44
00:11:46,811 --> 00:11:50,152
a man's got a right to play.

45
00:11:50,187 --> 00:11:53,978
Yes, sir, that's right.

46
00:11:55,783 --> 00:11:58,382
That ole lady of mine is hell on

47
00:11:58,417 --> 00:12:01,976
savin' money to join
the buryin' lodge.

48
00:12:02,011 --> 00:12:08,086
I says spend it while
you is still alive and kickin'.

49
00:12:22,134 --> 00:12:28,687
Lord, I is tired this night.

50
00:12:28,722 --> 00:12:31,727
I'm done with cotton.

51
00:12:31,762 --> 00:12:37,799
Better come along with me
on the Sea Gull.

52
00:12:37,834 --> 00:12:42,558
I got room for another fisherman.

53
00:12:42,593 --> 00:12:45,118
That suit me.

54
00:12:45,153 --> 00:12:49,016
This cotton hook done swing

55
00:12:49,051 --> 00:12:55,082
Here, who wants a cotton hook?

56
00:13:09,170 --> 00:13:12,435

70
00:14:30,624 --> 00:14:34,448
But...

71
00:14:34,483 --> 00:14:38,290
a woman is a sometime thing,

72
00:14:38,325 --> 00:14:41,859
Yes, a woman is a sometime thing.

73
00:14:41,894 --> 00:14:45,682
Oh, a woman is a sometime thing.

74
00:14:45,717 --> 00:14:49,296
Yo' mammy is the first to name you,

75
00:14:49,331 --> 00:14:53,202
Then she'll tie you
to her apron string,

76
00:14:53,237 --> 00:14:55,521
Then she'll shame you
and she'll blame you

77
00:14:55,556 --> 00:14:58,033
Till yo' woman comes to claim you,

78
00:14:58,068 --> 00:15:02,006
'Cause

79
00:15:02,041 --> 00:15:05,514

00:15:05,549 --> 00:15:08,881
Yes, a woman is a sometime thing.

81
00:15:08,916 --> 00:15:13,073
Oh, a woman is a sometime thing.

82
00:15:13,108 --> 00:15:18,946
Don't you never let
a woman grieve you

83
00:15:18,981 --> 00:15:22,619
Jus' cause she got
yo' weddin' ring.

00:15:22,654 --> 00:15:24,839
She'll love you
and deceive you,

85
00:15:24,874 --> 00:15:27,095
Take yo' clothes
and leave you

00:15:27,130 --> 00:15:31,171
'Cause

87

There now, what I tells you;

90
00:16:11,457 --> 00:16:14,402
He got better sense
than to listen to that nonsense.

91
00:16:14,437 --> 00:16:19,371

00:17:19,943 --> 00:17:21,949
Open the gate for him

104
00:17:44,865 --> 00:17:48,468
Here's the ol' crap shark!

105
00:17:48,503 --> 00:17:52,542
Now we'll have a game!

106
00:17:52,577 --> 00:17:58,043
Evenin' ladies,

108
00:18:04,139 --> 00:18:10,701
Luck been ridin' high
with Porgy today.

109
00:18:10,736 --> 00:18:18,604
I got a pocket full
of the Buckra money,

110
00:18:18,639 --> 00:18:24,172
and it's goin' to any man

111
00:18:24,207 --> 00:18:27,377
what got the guts to shoot it off me.

112
00:18:27,412 --> 00:18:32,493
Get on down, son we'll take it.

113
00:18:32,528 --> 00:18:38,931
Lay it down.

114
00:18:40,442 --> 00:18:43,141
All right, mens, roll 'em.

115
00:18:43,176 --> 00:18:46,785
We done wait long enough.

116
00:18:46,820 --> 00:18:50,958
You bes' wait for Crown.

117
00:18:50,993 --> 00:18:55,697
I see him comin',
takin' the whole sidewalk,

118
00:18:55,732 --> 00:18:59,708
And he looks like
he ain't gonna stand no foolin'.

119
00:18:59,743 --> 00:19:04,020
Is Bess with him?

120
00:19:04,055 --> 00:19:07,034
Lissen to Porgy.

121
00:19:07,069 --> 00:19:13,950
I think he's sof'
on Crown's Bess.

122
00:19:13,985 --> 00:19:21,500
I ain't nebber swap
two words with Bess.

123
00:19:21,535 --> 00:19:26,807
Porgy got too good sense

124
00:19:26,842 --> 00:19:30,519
to look twice at that
liquor guzzlin' slut.

125
00:19:30,554 --> 00:19:33,870
That gal Bess ain't fit

126
00:19:33,905 --> 00:19:39,755
for Gawd fearin'
ladies to 'sociate with.

127
00:19:39,790 --> 00:19:45,401
Can't you keep
yo' mouth off Bess.

128
00:19:45,436 --> 00:19:48,062
Between Gawd fearin' ladies

129
00:19:48,097 --> 00:19:50,654
and the Gawd damnin' men

130
00:19:50,689 --> 00:19:54,898
that gal ain't got a chance.

131
00:19:54,933 --> 00:20:00,380
Ain' I tells you Porgy sof' on her?

132
00:20:00,415 --> 00:20:07,442
No, no, brudder,

133
00:20:07,477 --> 00:20:13,180
Porgy ain't sof' on no woman;

134
00:20:16,289 --> 00:20:20,612
They pass by singin',

135
00:20:20,647 --> 00:20:30,130
they pass by cryin',

136
00:20:30,165 --> 00:20:34,752

137
00:20:34,787 --> 00:20:38,751
They look in my do'

138
00:20:38,786 --> 00:20:45,168
an' they keep on movin'.

139
00:20:45,203 --> 00:20:50,666
When Gawd make cripple,

140
00:20:50,701 --> 00:21:00,777
He mean him to be lonely.

141
00:21:00,812 --> 00:21:06,354
Night time, day time,

142
00:21:06,389 --> 00:21:18,105
He got to trabble
dat lonesome road.

143
00:21:18,140 --> 00:21:24,857
Night time, day time,

144
00:21:24,892 --> 00:21:44,656
He got to trabble
dat lonesome road.

145
00:21:59,508 --> 00:22:01,062
Here comes Big Boy!

146
00:22:01,097 --> 00:22:02,089
'Low, Crown.

147
00:22:02,124 --> 00:22:02,867
'Low, Bess.

148
00:22:09,026 --> 00:22:10,776
Hi, boys!

00:22:20,371 --> 00:22:23,595
Pay him, Bess.

152
00:22:23,630 --> 00:22:26,183
Drunk again!

153
00:22:26,218 --> 00:22:28,779
He sure love his liquor,

154
00:22:28,814 --> 00:22:34,285
but some day
she's gonna throw him down.

155
00:22:34,320 --> 00:22:39,526
That damn liquor'
jus' as weak as water.

156
00:22:44,583 --> 00:22:50,237
See that hussy drinkin' like any man!

Gawd fearin' ladies.

00:23:00,791 --> 00:23:10,739
There's nothin' like 'em,
thank Gawd.

159
00:23:20,710 --> 00:23:24,992
Oh, no, you don't.

160
00:23:25,027 --> 00:23:27,941
Nobody ain't drinkin'

161
00:23:27,976 --> 00:23:31,207
All right, mens,

00:23:31,242 --> 00:23:34,159

00:23:42,096 --> 00:23:43,552
Boxcars again.

164
00:23:45,144 --> 00:23:47,876
Cover 'em, brother,
cover 'em.

165
00:23:47,911 --> 00:23:53,197
I goin' to pass 'em along and see
if I can break my luck.

166
00:23:53,232 --> 00:23:58,118
Robbins' lady ain't allow him
but fifty cent

167
00:23:58,153 --> 00:24:00,580
and he can't take
no chances with bad luck.

168
00:24:00,615 --> 00:24:06,048
That's all right, honey boy,

169
00:24:06,083 --> 00:24:08,956
I'll stake you when
yo' four bits done gone.

170
00:24:08,991 --> 00:24:11,415
Go ahead an' play.

171
00:24:11,450 --> 00:24:14,919
You don't need no charity
off no she-devils.

172
00:24:14,954 --> 00:24:17,191
See what I gets for you.

173
00:24:17,226 --> 00:24:30,633
Yo' woman is easy
when you know the way.

174
00:24:32,979 --> 00:24:35,336
Crapped out!

175
00:24:37,145 --> 00:24:42,715
Don't you ever
let a woman grieve you

176
00:24:42,750 --> 00:24:47,228
Cause she got yo' wedding ring.

177
00:24:47,263 --> 00:24:49,627
She'll love you and deceive you,

178
00:24:49,662 --> 00:24:51,761
take yo' clothes and leave you

179
00:24:51,796 --> 00:24:55,818
'Cause...

180
00:24:55,853 --> 00:24:59,227
A woman is a sometime thing.

181
00:24:59,262 --> 00:25:10,085
Yes, a woman is a sometime thing.

182
00:25:14,389 --> 00:25:17,599
That gal ain't need to worry
'bout no man marryin' her.

183
00:25:17,634 --> 00:25:22,503
Some women got to marry
a man to keep him.

184
00:25:22,538 --> 00:25:24,679
Shut yo' damn mouth!

185
00:25:24,714 --> 00:25:28,407
You don't give Mingo a chance
to talk to the bones.

186
00:25:28,442 --> 00:25:30,189
Fade me.

187
00:25:37,451 --> 00:25:42,260
Old snake-eye go off an' die.

188
00:25:42,295 --> 00:25:45,745
Old man seven
come down from heaven.

189
00:25:47,418 --> 00:25:49,206
Seven!

190
00:25:52,662 --> 00:25:55,054
I ain't seen that seven yet.

191
00:25:55,089 --> 00:25:57,615
You done turn 'em over.

192
00:25:58,871 --> 00:26:00,740

193
00:26:00,775 --> 00:26:03,742
Seven.
Seven.

194
00:26:03,777 --> 00:26:08,040
Well there's more than one big mouth

195
00:26:08,075 --> 00:26:10,802
for pullin' 'em in
before I reads 'em see!

196
00:26:10,837 --> 00:26:16,345
An' I'm sayin' it

197
00:26:20,569 --> 00:26:24,285
Yo' mammy's gone

198
00:26:24,320 --> 00:26:27,108
and yo' daddy's happy

199
00:26:27,143 --> 00:26:29,877
Come home little bones,

come home to pappy.

201
00:26:33,921 --> 00:26:36,053
Four to make.

202
00:26:36,088 --> 00:26:38,697
Come four!

203
00:26:43,503 --> 00:26:45,722
Crapped out!

204
00:26:49,314 --> 00:26:53,523
I shoots like that.

205
00:26:53,558 --> 00:26:58,028
Come clean

206
00:26:59,940 --> 00:27:02,587

Six to make!

208
00:27:04,192 --> 00:27:11,125
Kiss rabbit foot and show
these tinhorns how to hit.

209
00:27:13,553 --> 00:27:15,673
Crapped out,

210
00:27:15,708 --> 00:27:17,180
come to your pappy

211
00:27:19,168 --> 00:27:22,924
Crown too cock-eyed drunk
to read 'em.

212
00:27:24,266 --> 00:27:26,270
What the dice say, Bess?

213
00:27:28,304 --> 00:27:29,900
Seven.

214
00:27:29,935 --> 00:27:33,086
I ain't drunk enough
to read 'em.

215
00:27:33,121 --> 00:27:34,741
That is the trouble.

216
00:27:36,358 --> 00:27:40,077
Licker ain't strong enough.

217
00:27:40,112 --> 00:27:44,683
Give me a pinch of happy dust,
Sportin' Life.

218
00:27:48,937 --> 00:27:53,456
Don't give him that stuff,
Sportin' Life.

219
00:27:53,491 --> 00:27:55,570
He's ugly drunk already.

220
00:27:55,605 --> 00:27:57,550
Pay him an' shut up.

221
00:28:05,027 --> 00:28:11,794
Frien' an' dice an' happy dust
ain't meant to 'sociate...

222
00:28:11,829 --> 00:28:13,562
You mens bes' go slow.

223
00:28:13,597 --> 00:28:17,194
Leave Peter be, let him alone.
He ain't mean no harm.

224
00:28:17,229 --> 00:28:22,431
Huh, seven!

225
00:28:22,466 --> 00:28:28,359

226
00:28:28,394 --> 00:28:30,358

God damn it,

228
00:28:46,014 --> 00:28:49,481
Crown cockeyed drunk,

230
00:28:51,741 --> 00:28:52,163
Crown cockeyed drunk,

231
00:28:53,498 --> 00:28:55,023
Shut up!

232
00:29:02,365 --> 00:29:05,314

233
00:29:09,679 --> 00:29:13,198
Seven!
Crapped out!

234
00:29:13,233 --> 00:29:17,478

235
00:29:19,352 --> 00:29:26,302
Oh, little stars, little stars,

236
00:29:26,337 --> 00:29:34,565
Roll, roll, roll me some light,

237

240
00:30:03,471 --> 00:30:08,023
Oh, no, my brother,

241
00:30:08,058 --> 00:30:12,808

242
00:30:12,843 --> 00:30:14,952
What is it, then?

243
00:30:14,987 --> 00:30:20,528
They is the monin'

00:30:33,796 --> 00:30:36,495
Turn me loose.

Well, you got them damn dice,

Crapped out!
Rolled out!

00:31:04,501 --> 00:31:07,814
Nine to make, come nine!

254

Read 'em.

255
00:31:11,995 --> 00:31:14,495
Nine spot!

Han' me that brick behin' you.

258
00:31:24,705 --> 00:31:29,424
Nobody's gettin' away
with Crown's money.

259
00:31:29,459 --> 00:31:33,913
I'm goin' kill dat bastard!

260
00:31:33,948 --> 00:31:35,813
Looks like trouble to me;

261
00:31:35,848 --> 00:31:37,583
He made his nine,

262
00:31:37,618 --> 00:31:40,564
There's gonna be a fight,
look out!

263
00:31:40,599 --> 00:31:43,520
Somebody hold them back,

264
00:31:43,555 --> 00:31:47,417
Crown got murder in his eye!

265
00:31:47,452 --> 00:31:51,207
Somebody hold them back!

266

Oh, stop them,
someone will get hurt!

267
00:31:54,460 --> 00:31:57,456
Why must people fight?

268
00:31:57,491 --> 00:31:59,628
Crown is a bad, bad bizness
when he's drunk!

269
00:31:59,663 --> 00:32:02,203
Why mus' they fight

270
00:32:51,346 --> 00:32:54,430
Can't anybody make Crown stop,

271

Lawd, please make dem stop!

272

Wake up an' hit it out.
You ain't got no time to lose.

274
00:33:31,901 --> 00:33:34,979
What the matter?

They know you an'

278
00:33:44,800 --> 00:33:48,341
Some man always willin'

279
00:33:48,376 --> 00:33:50,800
Well, get this:
whoever he is, he's temporary.

280
00:33:50,835 --> 00:33:54,402
I'm comin' back

281
00:33:54,437 --> 00:33:56,302
All right, only get out now.

00:33:58,122 --> 00:34:00,032

Sure, and I's the only friend
you got left.

285
00:34:18,102 --> 00:34:22,584
For Gawd's sake,

286
00:34:22,619 --> 00:34:29,064
I shakin' so
I can hardly stand.

287
00:34:35,642 --> 00:34:37,696

I ain't come to that yet.

292
00:34:55,044 --> 00:35:02,963
Well, the cops ain't goin' find me
here for no woman.

293
00:35:34,110 --> 00:35:36,174
You done bring trouble enough,

00:35:36,209 --> 00:35:38,251
get out before the police come.

295
00:35:38,286 --> 00:35:46,326
You wouldn't have a heart
and let me in?

296
00:35:46,361 --> 00:35:50,940
Not till hell freeze!

297
00:35:50,975 --> 00:35:56,680
Who live over there?

298
00:35:56,715 --> 00:35:59,505
That's Porgy,

299
00:35:59,540 --> 00:36:04,197
he ain't no use to your kind,

300
00:36:04,232 --> 00:36:10,137
he's a cripple and a beggar.

301
00:38:22,706 --> 00:38:31,354
Where is brudder Robbins?

302
00:38:31,389 --> 00:38:42,518
He's a-gone, gone, gone,

Who's dat acomin'

What's dat woman

321
00:40:56,819 --> 00:41:02,047
I don't need yo' money

322
00:41:02,082 --> 00:41:06,250
Dis ain't Crown's money.

323
00:41:06,285 --> 00:41:10,138
Porgy give me my money now.

324

All right, then.

Um! A saucer-burial setup,

372
00:44:13,120 --> 00:44:16,151
Yes, suh.

373
00:44:16,186 --> 00:44:19,834
He did not leave
any burial insurance?

374
00:44:19,869 --> 00:44:23,374
No, boss,
he didn't leave nuttin'.

375
00:44:23,409 --> 00:44:26,441
Well, see to it he's buried tomorrow.

376
00:44:28,543 --> 00:44:32,176
You killed Robbins an' I'm going

00:44:37,976 --> 00:44:39,628
Come along now!

380
00:44:39,663 --> 00:44:41,925
'Fore Gawd, boss,
I ain't never done um!

381
00:44:41,960 --> 00:44:43,841
Who did it, then?

382
00:44:43,876 --> 00:44:45,424
You heard me, who did it?

383
00:44:45,459 --> 00:44:49,654
Crown done it, boss.
I done see him do it.

384
00:44:49,689 --> 00:44:52,200
You're sure you saw him?

385
00:44:52,235 --> 00:44:54,852
I swear to Gawd, boss,

386
00:44:54,887 --> 00:44:57,475
I was right there beside him.

387
00:44:57,510 --> 00:45:02,187
That was easy.
I thought as much.

388
00:45:03,147 --> 00:45:05,602
You. You saw it too.

389
00:45:05,637 --> 00:45:09,261
I don't want to have
to put the law on you.

390
00:45:09,296 --> 00:45:12,083
Look at me,
you damn dummy!

391
00:45:12,118 --> 00:45:17,874
I don't know nuttin'
'bout it, boss.

392
00:45:19,448 --> 00:45:23,735
That's your room in the corner,
ain't it?

393
00:45:23,770 --> 00:45:27,865
Yes, boss, dat's my room.

394
00:45:27,900 --> 00:45:32,023
The door opens on the court,
don't it?

395
00:45:32,058 --> 00:45:36,465
Yes, boss, my door opens
on the court.

396
00:45:36,500 --> 00:45:40,216
An' yet you didn't see
or hear anything?

397
00:45:40,251 --> 00:45:43,635
I don't know nuttin'
'bout it, boss.

398
00:45:43,670 --> 00:45:46,037
I been asleep inside,

399
00:45:46,072 --> 00:45:49,463
and my door been closed.

400
00:45:49,498 --> 00:45:52,973
You're a damn liar.

401
00:46:03,740 --> 00:46:05,181
He saw the killing;

402
00:46:05,216 --> 00:46:07,285
take him along and lock him up
as a material witness.

403
00:46:07,320 --> 00:46:08,364
Come along, uncle.

404
00:46:08,399 --> 00:46:09,722
I ain't done it, boss.

405
00:46:09,757 --> 00:46:12,158
How long you goin' lock him up for?

406
00:46:12,193 --> 00:46:14,996
Till we catch Crown.

407
00:46:15,031 --> 00:46:17,566
I reckon Crown done loose now

408
00:46:17,601 --> 00:46:19,469
in de palmetto thickets,

409
00:46:19,504 --> 00:46:23,989
an' dere ain' no rope
long enough to hang him.

410
00:46:24,024 --> 00:46:27,805
Then the old man's out of luck.

411
00:46:27,840 --> 00:46:29,041
Remember,

412
00:46:29,076 --> 00:46:31,168
you've got to bury
that body tomorrow

413
00:46:31,203 --> 00:46:33,050
or the board of health
will take him

414
00:46:33,085 --> 00:46:35,149
an' turn him over
to the medical students.

415
00:46:35,184 --> 00:46:37,057
Come on,
get the old man in the wagon.

416
00:46:42,011 --> 00:46:43,831
I ain't never done nuttin', boss.

417
00:46:43,866 --> 00:46:46,178
I swear to Gawd
I ain' never done nuttin'.

418
00:46:53,821 --> 00:46:57,260
I can't puzzle this thing out.

419
00:46:57,295 --> 00:46:59,295
Peter was a good man,

420
00:46:59,330 --> 00:47:03,427
but dat lousy Crown was a killer

421
00:47:03,462 --> 00:47:06,367
and forever gettin' into trouble.

422
00:47:06,402 --> 00:47:07,948
That's the truth, brother.

423
00:47:07,983 --> 00:47:11,695
And there go Peter
to be lock up like a thief.

424
00:47:11,730 --> 00:47:13,161
Like a thief.

425
00:47:13,196 --> 00:47:16,330
An' here be Robbins

426
00:47:16,365 --> 00:47:18,937

427
00:47:18,972 --> 00:47:23,555
and his fadderless chillen,

428
00:47:23,590 --> 00:47:27,381
an' Crown done gone his ways

429
00:47:27,416 --> 00:47:31,738
drinkin', gamblin', swearin',

430
00:47:31,773 --> 00:47:37,394
to do the same thing
over and over somewheres else.

431
00:47:41,903 --> 00:48:09,496
Gone, gone, gone,
gone, gone, gone.

432
00:48:20,670 --> 00:48:26,304
My man's gone now,

433
00:48:26,339 --> 00:48:30,545
Ain't no use alistenin'

Climbin' up de stairs. Ah!

Since my man is dead!

458
00:52:10,241 --> 00:52:14,414
How de saucer stan' now,

There ain't but fifteen dollar.

00:52:18,339 --> 00:52:22,032
Hum! Can't bury him
for fifteen dollar.

461
00:52:22,067 --> 00:52:25,214
He got to be buried tomorrow

00:52:25,249 --> 00:52:27,153
or the board of health will

463

469
00:52:46,773 --> 00:52:49,747
Don't let the students take him

00:52:49,782 --> 00:52:53,193

471

You can all be ready

00:53:40,858 --> 00:53:47,527
It's a long trip to the cemetery.

00:54:04,532 --> 00:54:15,008
Oh, he's gone, gone, gone,
