172
00:09:44,089 --> 00:09:45,089
Yeah!

173
00:09:45,090 --> 00:09:46,441
I thought it would make a
small difference.

174
00:09:46,442 --> 00:09:47,442
Absolutely!

175
00:09:51,063 --> 00:09:52,611
I'll take care of your car,
being careful.

176
00:09:53,262 --> 00:09:55,916
Look for the manager, I am sure that
he will arrange something for you.

177
00:09:55,917 --> 00:09:56,917
Thanks mate.

178
00:10:00,399 --> 00:10:01,317
Hey you!

179
00:10:02,357 --> 00:10:02,941
I?

180
00:10:03,177 --> 00:10:05,399
Yes, you! Can not stop
that thing there, in the passage.

181
00:10:05,931 --> 00:10:06,887
Get out there!

182
00:10:15,802 --> 00:10:16,399
Mr. Hathaway?

183
00:10:17,437 --> 00:10:18,758
Guess who just arrived?

184
00:10:21,040 --> 00:10:22,281
Thanks, muitoobrigado.

185
00:10:24,830 --> 00:10:26,984
Excuse me Miss, I hope
not have hurt you.

186
00:10:40,525 --> 00:10:41,552
Spurs tangled!

187
00:10:42,337 --> 00:10:42,999
Naughty!

188
00:10:44,811 --> 00:10:46,197
Mr. Hayward, I presume.

189
00:10:46,779 --> 00:10:47,499
Yeah!

190
00:10:48,299 --> 00:10:49,943
Welcome to Hotel Shores, sir.

191
00:10:50,478 --> 00:10:52,134
Oh .. Well you know me huh?

192
00:10:52,135 --> 00:10:54,217
I do not remember
meet you sir ...

193
00:10:54,218 --> 00:10:55,218
Hathaway, sir.

194
00:10:55,219 --> 00:10:57,135
Hello sir. Hathaway,
pleasure to meet you.

195
00:10:58,009 --> 00:11:00,924
Look Mr Hathaway, my bones are
breaking through to know?

196
00:11:00,925 --> 00:11:03,331
I need a soft place
and nice to stretch them.

197
00:11:04,654 --> 00:11:07,295
Well, I think we
you find something appropriate.

198
00:11:07,296 --> 00:11:08,296
Very good!

199
00:11:09,168 --> 00:11:09,797
Excuse me!

200
00:11:29,192 --> 00:11:31,199
Hello! Everything under control?

201
00:11:40,153 --> 00:11:40,966
Mr. Wayward ...

202
00:11:43,155 --> 00:11:43,767
Oh yeah?

203
00:11:44,513 --> 00:11:46,389
I think we found
a place, sir.

204
00:11:46,390 --> 00:11:47,390
Ordinance!

205
00:11:50,413 --> 00:11:53,575
Follow Mr. Hayward
the presidential suite.

206
00:11:54,444 --> 00:11:55,199
Presidential suite?

207
00:11:56,450 --> 00:11:58,919
Well, how did reservations ...

208
00:11:59,221 --> 00:12:00,726
... Will have to serve.

209
00:12:01,041 --> 00:12:03,420
Very nice, Mr Hayward,
I say, Mr Hathaway.

210
00:12:06,952 --> 00:12:07,520
The bleachers were full ...

211
00:12:07,521 --> 00:12:10,484
and you could feel the
electricity in the air.

212
00:12:11,014 --> 00:12:15,660
Well .. it was the most exciting thing
what ever happened to me.

213
00:12:16,574 --> 00:12:17,828
I'll show you,
can handle it?

214
00:12:17,829 --> 00:12:18,218
Yes

215
00:12:18,219 --> 00:12:18,773
Thanks.

216
00:12:19,466 --> 00:12:22,489
Now, just imagine, here
... we're four.

217
00:12:22,490 --> 00:12:25,578
Okay ... well at the start,
accelerates a guy ...

218
00:12:25,800 --> 00:12:27,873
... E. .. bam!
It's out of the race.

219
00:12:28,533 --> 00:12:30,552
Now we are only three ...
only three ...

220
00:12:30,553 --> 00:12:34,282
... And suddenly ... bam!
one of the boats go flying ...

221
00:12:36,748 --> 00:12:37,949
... And there we were, just us two ...

222
00:12:37,950 --> 00:12:40,013
... Just the two of us in the race ...

223
00:12:41,074 --> 00:12:43,133
... Now I know it's time
to leap ...

224
00:12:43,134 --> 00:12:44,968
- Mr Jameson?
- Yes, Charlie?

225
00:12:44,969 --> 00:12:48,354
I put the new propulsion and already
put in the water, waiting for you.

226
00:12:48,355 --> 00:12:49,266
Okay, I'm already there.

227
00:12:49,948 --> 00:12:51,710
Well, ladies, I hate
having to leave them ...

228
00:12:52,116 --> 00:12:53,988
Do not go, finish the story.

229
00:12:55,607 --> 00:12:57,452
Well .. to shorten the story ...

230
00:12:59,286 --> 00:12:59,820
I won!

231
00:13:02,425 --> 00:13:04,570
And I have also established
a new record.

232
00:13:06,573 --> 00:13:10,678
But now my passion, this is
race so if you'll excuse me ...

233
00:13:10,679 --> 00:13:14,343
... I'll take to Lady Scarlet
North Point and will regulate it.

234
00:13:15,111 --> 00:13:19,499
And tightening may be
anyone else that fits it.

235
00:13:19,695 --> 00:13:20,500
Any takers?

236
00:13:22,491 --> 00:13:23,459
I like to go.

237
00:13:24,739 --> 00:13:25,599
Mr. Jamison ...

238
00:13:26,411 --> 00:13:27,398
... Love getting tight.

239
00:13:29,017 --> 00:13:29,799
Me too.

240
00:13:51,882 --> 00:13:54,800
- Yes?
- I'm Tom Wilson ... Wilson.

241
00:13:55,280 --> 00:13:58,019
Sorry Mr Wilson, we
completely full.

242
00:13:58,020 --> 00:13:59,288
I'm not looking
quarter.

243
00:14:00,092 --> 00:14:02,383
- Good!
- I am the new ski instructor.

244
00:14:06,196 --> 00:14:08,842
Wilson! The input
service is back there ...

245
00:14:08,843 --> 00:14:09,999
Excuse me, Mr Hathaway.

246
00:14:10,000 --> 00:14:12,176
- Is the new ski instructor?
That's right.

247
00:14:12,177 --> 00:14:15,647
Want to make an appointment for a
class tomorrow, Miss Carter?

248
00:14:15,648 --> 00:14:16,800
Not tomorrow, now!

249
00:14:17,196 --> 00:14:19,883
Mr Wilson only begins
to work tomorrow.

250
00:14:20,305 --> 00:14:25,621
Mr Wilson, as a special favor,
could start their classes today?

251
00:14:26,957 --> 00:14:29,692
I think so, I just have to
find my room and leave it there.

252
00:14:30,099 --> 00:14:33,325
Great! See you on the platform
Ski-... 5 minutes?

253
00:14:33,326 --> 00:14:35,553
- In five minutes?
- Unless you arrive before!

254
00:14:39,183 --> 00:14:39,654
Mr. Hathaway ...

255
00:14:41,094 --> 00:14:42,907
Exactly where ...
North Point is?

256
00:14:50,797 --> 00:14:52,099
Are you sure you need lessons?

257
00:14:52,699 --> 00:14:53,800
Ohh yeah ... yeah.

258
00:14:57,649 --> 00:14:59,162
I figured it would lose
balance this time.

259
00:14:59,844 --> 00:15:00,783
Yes I was lucky.

260
00:15:09,529 --> 00:15:11,439
- She's a beauty.
- Yes it is.

261
00:15:12,342 --> 00:15:13,299
Someone who knows?

262
00:15:14,196 --> 00:15:14,924
Not yet.

263
00:15:19,599 --> 00:15:20,718
What are you trying to do?

264
00:15:44,478 --> 00:15:45,739
I can teach you
anything else?

265
00:16:39,261 --> 00:16:39,840
And then?

266
00:16:40,967 --> 00:16:43,422
I was teaching you to keep
balance and suddenly ...

267
00:16:43,423 --> 00:16:45,811
... This boat and it appears
begins to juggle ...

268
00:16:45,812 --> 00:16:47,873
... As if one of profissisonal
Cyprens Gardens.

269
00:16:50,316 --> 00:16:51,540
Where did you get that?

270
00:16:52,642 --> 00:16:55,709
There is too much?
I knew that I would like ... 20 bucks!

271
00:16:55,986 --> 00:16:57,789
Twenty bucks?
Never paid for it ...

272
00:16:57,790 --> 00:16:59,530
- For a tie in my life!
- Until today!

273
00:16:59,949 --> 00:17:01,861
The next time you want a
tie, let me choose.

274
00:17:01,862 --> 00:17:03,503
After all, the
reputation is mine!

275
00:17:03,504 --> 00:17:05,317
Yeah! Dude, I enjoy myself here.

276
00:17:06,033 --> 00:17:07,080
Tonight, for example ...

277
00:17:07,081 --> 00:17:10,141
... I have a meeting with a
millionaire named Jamison.

278
00:17:10,730 --> 00:17:11,874
May know,
he is the jammies.

279
00:17:12,338 --> 00:17:13,739
- What?
- Jammies.

280
00:17:13,972 --> 00:17:15,793
You know, the parts
girls wearing ...

281
00:17:15,794 --> 00:17:18,045
.. And say they are sleepwear.
He is in them!

282
00:17:18,046 --> 00:17:20,071
- He uses them?
- No! He who manufactures them.

283
00:17:20,072 --> 00:17:21,072
The "Jammmies?

284
00:17:21,851 --> 00:17:24,633
Is it once a year
just come for the race.

285
00:17:24,924 --> 00:17:26,392
And won the last three ...

286
00:17:27,004 --> 00:17:29,013
... Which is no surprise,
considering the boat he has.

287
00:17:29,014 --> 00:17:30,555
It must be worth a fortune.

288
00:17:31,489 --> 00:17:32,841
Does he have more
money than me?

289
00:17:35,973 --> 00:17:39,426
A red boat, great
with tailpipes up ...

290
00:17:39,427 --> 00:17:40,789
... And exiting the water ...

291
00:17:40,790 --> 00:17:43,923
- Is the Scarlet Lady?
- Yes, you saw him?

292
00:17:43,924 --> 00:17:45,921
This is the boat for which
Dianne was showing off.

293
00:17:47,606 --> 00:17:49,642
Understood, it also
is behind him.

294
00:17:51,821 --> 00:17:53,205
So tonight
I am concerned ...

295
00:17:54,102 --> 00:17:56,328
Your little joke ...
this week it went nowhere.

296
00:17:56,668 --> 00:17:58,658
Jamison jammies and I
made other plans.

297
00:17:59,022 --> 00:18:00,487
- Arrange the tie.
- Okay, thanks.

298
00:18:01,284 --> 00:18:03,062
Sure, try it at home.

299
00:18:05,244 --> 00:18:07,731
If you need anything,
call room service ...

300
00:18:07,732 --> 00:18:10,400
... And can sign on my behalf.

301
00:18:10,401 --> 00:18:12,190
Thanks! Get out!

302
00:18:42,549 --> 00:18:43,398
Mr. Jamison!

303
00:18:44,019 --> 00:18:45,532
Hello Paul, the usual please.

304
00:18:45,533 --> 00:18:48,230
J J Special right?
I was waiting.

305
00:18:54,263 --> 00:18:54,899
Hey, Mr Jamison ...

306
00:18:56,002 --> 00:18:59,089
... Want to ask something,
Here comes the year, right?

307
00:18:59,593 --> 00:19:02,504
You know my wife is
filling the bag, whatever you play ...

308
00:19:02,505 --> 00:19:06,229
... You could get something from
Jamie settlement jammies?

309
00:19:06,230 --> 00:19:07,324
I hate to ask, but you know ...

310
00:19:07,325 --> 00:19:09,538
- His wife ...?
- Yes.

311
00:19:09,605 --> 00:19:11,918
- Sure ...
- My wife, actually.

312
00:19:12,681 --> 00:19:13,835
- Really?
- Yes!

313
00:19:14,860 --> 00:19:17,796
Of course .. of course Paul, I ... I take care of it
so back to New York.

314
00:19:18,319 --> 00:19:19,324
- Thanks.
- Actually ...

315
00:19:21,446 --> 00:19:23,424
... We have a new
coming this year ...

316
00:19:24,231 --> 00:19:30,850
... So soft, they do not know where
Jammies and just get the girl.

317
00:19:33,763 --> 00:19:34,398
Forget it.

318
00:19:35,467 --> 00:19:37,466
I already have six children, not
need one more, right?

319
00:19:37,467 --> 00:19:39,155
Ahhh ... it is!

320
00:19:41,704 --> 00:19:42,874
How about something in flannel?

321
00:19:43,759 --> 00:19:44,398
Flannel?

322
00:19:51,981 --> 00:19:53,640
Yes ma'am, what will it be?

323
00:19:56,046 --> 00:19:56,775
What is that?

324
00:19:56,776 --> 00:19:59,589
What?
A J J Special.

325
00:20:00,812 --> 00:20:03,095
Sounds interesting, or would
better to say dangerous?

326
00:20:03,096 --> 00:20:04,808
Depends on your mood.

327
00:20:04,809 --> 00:20:08,254
It may be interesting or
dangerous, or both.

328
00:20:09,236 --> 00:20:09,890
Ohh .. I see.

329
00:20:10,133 --> 00:20:12,301
In your case, I think
would dangerously interesting.

330
00:20:14,019 --> 00:20:15,773
"I'll take one.
- It's coming out.

331
00:20:16,658 --> 00:20:18,307
Forgive my curiosity, but ...

332
00:20:19,461 --> 00:20:22,081
... I have not seen before?
This afternoon, for example?

333
00:20:22,767 --> 00:20:25,128
I doubt, I was skiing
this afternoon.

334
00:20:25,129 --> 00:20:26,129
So it was you!

335
00:20:27,253 --> 00:20:28,859
Remember the boat race?

336
00:20:30,919 --> 00:20:31,704
The Scarlet Lady?

337
00:20:33,276 --> 00:20:35,345
- That was me.
- Really?

338
00:20:36,258 --> 00:20:37,977
Was doing some
maneuvers very good.

339
00:20:39,257 --> 00:20:40,090
That was nothing.

340
00:20:40,960 --> 00:20:44,493
Well .. I'm James Jamison,
and you're ...

341
00:20:45,139 --> 00:20:47,916
- Dianne Carter.
- How are you?

342
00:20:49,899 --> 00:20:50,699
Hi friend!

343
00:20:58,055 --> 00:20:58,700
Excuse me.

344
00:21:06,433 --> 00:21:08,422
Gloria, this is J J Jamison.

345
00:21:10,034 --> 00:21:12,826
- How are you?
- I am doing fine, sure.

346
00:21:12,827 --> 00:21:17,409
J J Come, let us leave here and find
something more exciting.

347
00:21:18,217 --> 00:21:19,168
You're ready to go?

348
00:21:19,947 --> 00:21:21,736
Ready, eager e. .. available.

349
00:21:23,870 --> 00:21:24,737
Be right back.

350
00:21:26,754 --> 00:21:27,738
We'll see.

351
00:21:30,698 --> 00:21:31,499
Here we are.

352
00:21:48,121 --> 00:21:50,275
- Hi
- Waiting for someone?

353
00:21:50,771 --> 00:21:51,940
Not anymore.

354
00:21:51,941 --> 00:21:54,636
Well .. if so ... can I?

355
00:21:54,637 --> 00:21:55,399
Yes

356
00:21:56,943 --> 00:21:58,707
Now, on to lesson
ski this afternoon ...

357
00:21:59,624 --> 00:22:00,918
I think I owe you an apology.

358
00:22:00,919 --> 00:22:02,970
Okay, just do not do it again.

359
00:22:03,971 --> 00:22:05,171
This is the first time
I'm in Miami.

360
00:22:05,947 --> 00:22:07,632
The first night, and you,
the first girl I meet.

361
00:22:07,633 --> 00:22:10,501
I thought of a ride
around, you come with me?

362
00:22:11,814 --> 00:22:13,143
Why not? This seems
it will be fun.

363
00:22:13,879 --> 00:22:15,033
I paid, we'll see ...

364
00:22:15,034 --> 00:22:16,484
- ... So if you switch.
- I switch?

365
00:22:16,485 --> 00:22:18,811
Sure, pants are best
to ride bikes.

366
00:22:19,499 --> 00:22:22,073
Bike? You must be kidding.

367
00:22:22,074 --> 00:22:23,424
Sorry, but this
is your problem.

368
00:22:25,513 --> 00:22:27,526
- Okay, see you ...
- Five minutes.

369
00:22:27,527 --> 00:22:29,643
- Five minutes?
- Unless you arrive before.

370
00:22:31,363 --> 00:22:31,744
Touché!

371
00:23:03,142 --> 00:23:04,345
- How's it going?
- Very good.

372
00:23:20,073 --> 00:23:21,341
Hey, come on!

373
00:23:25,794 --> 00:23:26,882
I must be getting old.

374
00:23:27,720 --> 00:23:29,849
Hey look, leave tomorrow
work at 16 ...

375
00:23:29,850 --> 00:23:31,689
... How about a boat?

376
00:23:31,690 --> 00:23:33,030
- And there's this restaurant that ...
- No.

377
00:23:34,262 --> 00:23:36,607
Tom, do not miss
your time with me ...

378
00:23:36,608 --> 00:23:39,157
... I am not rich, and my
family is not rich.

379
00:23:39,158 --> 00:23:41,961
- How so?
- Look, I understand ...

380
00:23:41,962 --> 00:23:44,328
... You guys, come
here for the season ...

381
00:23:44,329 --> 00:23:47,279
... Housekeepers, lifeguards,
Ski Instructors ...

382
00:23:47,280 --> 00:23:50,275
... All hoping to find
a girl ... very very rich.

383
00:23:50,933 --> 00:23:52,687
I understand, I was so obvious?

384
00:23:52,952 --> 00:23:53,688
Ohh no ...

385
00:23:54,303 --> 00:23:54,689
No. ..

386
00:23:54,690 --> 00:23:56,940
... Is that one is able to
recognize the other.

387
00:23:57,452 --> 00:24:00,255
We are of the same type, you
think I'm doing here?

388
00:24:01,911 --> 00:24:05,575
For years, I've saved and
I saved up ... I pledge ...

389
00:24:05,576 --> 00:24:07,747
... Half of my clothes are
lent, and the other half ...

390
00:24:07,748 --> 00:24:11,584
... Put labels Sack's, everything
to be able to come here e. ..

391
00:24:12,373 --> 00:24:13,486
And find a millionaire.

392
00:24:14,359 --> 00:24:15,887
Okay, I admit ...

393
00:24:17,375 --> 00:24:18,970
... I do not know why
telling you that.

394
00:24:19,828 --> 00:24:21,114
No wonder why he left me ...

395
00:24:21,115 --> 00:24:23,115
... That's not in their plans.

396
00:24:24,912 --> 00:24:26,173
I think it's because
I like you.

397
00:24:27,080 --> 00:24:29,746
Besides, who knows, they may
to let him jealous.

398
00:24:30,509 --> 00:24:31,554
"He" is Jamison?

399
00:24:31,949 --> 00:24:32,555
Yes

400
00:24:33,586 --> 00:24:35,047
Maybe you need
more ski lessons.

401
00:24:36,241 --> 00:24:37,893
- Will you help me?
- Why not?

402
00:24:37,894 --> 00:24:39,800
How you pay
I can repay the favor.

403
00:24:40,584 --> 00:24:42,585
And who knows it ...
may have a sister?

404
00:24:49,118 --> 00:24:51,152
They say that, looking
deeply a bonfire ...

405
00:24:51,153 --> 00:24:52,768
... Sometimes, if you can
see the future.

406
00:24:53,624 --> 00:24:54,779
Well .. what you see?

407
00:25:03,113 --> 00:25:05,008
<i> <b> I can see you now </ b> </ i>

408
00:25:07,413 --> 00:25:09,663
<i> <b> Living like a queen </ b> </ i>

426
00:26:26,221 --> 00:26:29,330

427
00:26:29,331 --> 00:26:31,662

428
00:26:33,566 --> 00:26:36,592

432
00:26:51,327 --> 00:26:57,085
<i> <b> Anything but Love </ b> </ i>

433
00:27:08,617 --> 00:27:09,490
I think we'd better go.

434
00:27:09,491 --> 00:27:10,491
Is.

435
00:27:58,908 --> 00:28:00,885
It is better that engine speed,
he is very cool.

436
00:28:02,961 --> 00:28:05,102
That boat was
second last year.

437
00:28:05,955 --> 00:28:08,646
Will not get anywhere
this year, if it continues.

438
00:28:08,647 --> 00:28:09,647
Listen to him.

439
00:28:17,500 --> 00:28:18,642
You have a great ear.

440
00:28:20,873 --> 00:28:22,980
- Am Burton Sam Burton.
-Tom Wilson.

441
00:28:23,700 --> 00:28:25,023
I guess I never
seen around here before.

442
00:28:25,024 --> 00:28:26,849
I am a ski instructor from the hotel.

443
00:28:27,326 --> 00:28:30,493
The way he spoke I thought
were of any team.

444
00:28:30,494 --> 00:28:32,494
No.. Just curious
I like boats.

445
00:28:34,615 --> 00:28:37,320
We lost the last one
race in south bend.

446
00:28:37,321 --> 00:28:38,841
What happened?

447
00:28:38,842 --> 00:28:41,448
It was an experimental model
he was working on ...

448
00:28:41,449 --> 00:28:44,878
... When it came to 140,
began to vibrate ...

449
00:28:44,879 --> 00:28:48,149
... The 150 began to unravel ...

450
00:28:48,150 --> 00:28:50,642
... I could not handle it
and entered into a pillar.

451
00:28:51,543 --> 00:28:53,526
What a pity, perhaps
better luck this year.

452
00:28:53,527 --> 00:28:55,182
I'm not running this year ...

453
00:28:55,726 --> 00:28:57,924
... Costs a lot to rebuild it
with little hope ...

454
00:28:57,925 --> 00:28:59,586
... That we can find
what went wrong ...

455
00:28:59,587 --> 00:29:03,184
... If you know of someone who wants
buy a boat damaged ...

456
00:29:03,185 --> 00:29:04,467
... Very cheap, have
to my shop in Miami.

457
00:29:04,468 --> 00:29:06,655
- And what would it be?
- Burton Boat Company.

458
00:29:06,884 --> 00:29:08,538
Ohh! Sam Burton is that you?

459
00:29:09,594 --> 00:29:11,499
- Nice talking to you.
- My pleasure, Mr Burton.

460
00:29:19,035 --> 00:29:21,015
- Go with someone else?
- Hi

461
00:29:21,662 --> 00:29:23,879
Come on, just to see our friend
J J going to the beach.

462
00:29:24,238 --> 00:29:25,810
In this case, it is best to move.

463
00:29:26,161 --> 00:29:26,811
But this time I'm riding.

464
00:29:36,412 --> 00:29:38,029
- Are you ready?
- Accelerate.

465
00:29:51,755 --> 00:29:52,480
Hey! Who is she?

466
00:29:55,827 --> 00:29:59,843
- Funny ask ...
- Forget it, I'll find out.

467
00:30:01,096 --> 00:30:01,544
Come on.

468
00:30:04,066 --> 00:30:07,113
Quick, quick!
Let's reach.

469
00:30:07,114 --> 00:30:08,599
Let's follow that boat!

470
00:30:17,922 --> 00:30:20,376
- Take the girl!
- Go, go.

471
00:30:27,319 --> 00:30:30,126
- Hi you guys!
"Hi honey, wait a minute!

472
00:30:30,491 --> 00:30:31,610
Turn! Turn! Turn!

473
00:30:41,019 --> 00:30:42,122
Wait for us.

474
00:30:52,549 --> 00:30:53,623
Closer!

475
00:31:01,072 --> 00:31:02,429
Hold hands!

476
00:31:04,073 --> 00:31:05,971
Come on!
Easy! Easy!

477
00:31:05,972 --> 00:31:07,187
No. .. no ...

478
00:31:20,797 --> 00:31:21,588
Look!

479
00:31:23,704 --> 00:31:24,589
Come on!

480
00:31:32,356 --> 00:31:33,106
Are you okay?

481
00:31:33,818 --> 00:31:35,426
No! Turn the other way!

482
00:31:36,152 --> 00:31:38,285
- What is the problem?
- I lost the top!

483
00:31:38,886 --> 00:31:41,074
Ohhh timing perfect!
Jamison has been swimming here!

484
00:31:42,862 --> 00:31:44,704
Come back! Please come back!

485
00:31:45,709 --> 00:31:47,496
Go away! Go away!

486
00:31:47,497 --> 00:31:50,056
It was a really good trick
who tried to ski.

487
00:31:50,057 --> 00:31:51,537
There was a trick.

488
00:31:52,267 --> 00:31:54,737
I lost my balance,
can go away please?

489
00:31:54,738 --> 00:31:55,470
Not only was the balance
she lost!

490
00:31:58,727 --> 00:31:59,767
This is what you seek?

491
00:31:59,768 --> 00:32:01,543
Give it to me please.

492
00:32:02,586 --> 00:32:05,029
No. .. not unless they promise will
a drink with me at the hotel.

493
00:32:05,030 --> 00:32:06,926
Okay, I promise! I promise!

494
00:32:06,999 --> 00:32:07,499
Right.

495
00:32:09,473 --> 00:32:10,788
- Thanks.
- Sure.

496
00:32:10,959 --> 00:32:12,774
Look, can I help you?

497
00:32:12,775 --> 00:32:15,084
No. .. you can let me
I turn myself thank you.

498
00:32:21,579 --> 00:32:23,176
Turn around please.

499
00:32:30,818 --> 00:32:31,577
Himself together?

500
00:32:32,171 --> 00:32:35,000
- Yes, all right now.
- Come, let's get back on my boat.

501
00:32:40,295 --> 00:32:42,802
- Okay.
- You could launch a new fashion.

502
00:32:42,803 --> 00:32:46,339
- And what would it be?
- Water skiing, "topless" will go.

503
00:33:13,836 --> 00:33:16,636
Can not blame a girl
for wanting the finer things.

504
00:33:26,572 --> 00:33:28,570
Scott, wait for me!

505
00:33:29,189 --> 00:33:31,336
Come on! Was it something I said?

506
00:33:32,289 --> 00:33:33,513
It's a long way back!

507
00:33:34,922 --> 00:33:36,416
Here Flipper! Here boy!

508
00:33:47,764 --> 00:33:49,204
The funny thing is that she thinks
I'm here ...

509
00:33:49,205 --> 00:33:52,434
Speak louder Scott
I am a bit flooded!

510
00:33:53,393 --> 00:33:56,197
The funny thing is that she thinks I'm
here for the same reason she.

511
00:33:57,131 --> 00:33:58,185
Pump and dump!

512
00:33:58,937 --> 00:34:00,900
If she is so
interested in money ...

513
00:34:00,901 --> 00:34:02,548
... Why did not
over me?

514
00:34:02,549 --> 00:34:05,466
-Lots of competition.
- I think so.

515
00:34:06,525 --> 00:34:09,580
It will be interesting to see how
she will deal with the old J J. huh?

516
00:34:09,581 --> 00:34:12,258
Of course, with Jamison
there is only one way.

517
00:34:13,212 --> 00:34:14,839
What's wrong?
Does it bother you?

518
00:34:14,840 --> 00:34:16,966
No, that's his problem, not mine.

519
00:34:43,257 --> 00:34:45,466
Hey kids!
Hey kids!

520
00:34:46,139 --> 00:34:47,261
Calm down children!

521
00:34:48,280 --> 00:34:50,998
Quiet! What's the matter little girl?

522
00:34:50,999 --> 00:34:53,278
They think I'm
fear of slipping.

523
00:34:53,279 --> 00:34:54,941
Why not show
they are wrong?

524
00:34:54,942 --> 00:34:56,741
Because I'm afraid.

525
00:34:57,460 --> 00:34:58,488
Come on, try.

526
00:34:59,815 --> 00:35:02,066
- No.
- I'm right here and you get caught.

527
00:35:02,424 --> 00:35:03,389
I can not.

528
00:35:03,937 --> 00:35:06,117
I would be surprised by things
you can do, just try it.

Ice cream for everyone "

563
00:40:18,131 --> 00:40:19,728
It seems to have a knack for
dealing with children.

564
00:40:19,729 --> 00:40:21,010
I think it's the opposite.

565
00:40:21,602 --> 00:40:24,064
Wilson, the handle of my
skiing needs adjustment.

566
00:40:24,065 --> 00:40:26,353
Fix it please? I think that
compensate for the job.

567
00:40:31,493 --> 00:40:33,183
I did think the Scarlet Lady
for a ride.

568
00:40:34,024 --> 00:40:35,337
We still have a luau that night.

569
00:40:37,807 --> 00:40:40,236
I wonder, how you want to compete
how all that money?

570
00:40:41,064 --> 00:40:43,253
- One way would be to race.
- We temosum boat?

571
00:40:43,828 --> 00:40:45,565
We have three ... but all are in Texas.

572
00:40:45,566 --> 00:40:47,595
And with your salary, is
precisely where they will stay.

573
00:40:48,113 --> 00:40:49,718
Moreover, with the
your bank balance ...

574
00:40:49,719 --> 00:40:53,486
Hold on buddy, is not
trying to prove something to yourself ...

575
00:40:53,487 --> 00:40:55,021
... Without using your money?

576
00:40:56,125 --> 00:40:57,751
Thanks, let's forget all that.

577
00:40:59,910 --> 00:41:02,497
I just had an idea, I know where
I can get a boat!

578
00:41:04,326 --> 00:41:07,540
- For 10 bucks?
- Ten thousand would be more appropriate.

579
00:41:09,386 --> 00:41:11,381
Still, I would not have time
to fix it for the race.

580
00:41:11,911 --> 00:41:14,063
- We can see the boat?
- Sure, come on.

581
00:41:15,268 --> 00:41:16,593
But I mean a
thing to you guys ...

582
00:41:18,007 --> 00:41:19,776
... Spent a lot of time and
money on this boat ...

583
00:41:20,512 --> 00:41:23,036
... The conditions in which it is now
I think just praying no way.

584
00:41:28,365 --> 00:41:29,951
All he needs is
reconstruction and a new engine.

585
00:41:30,715 --> 00:41:32,067
Much money for you Tom

586
00:41:32,558 --> 00:41:34,323
Unless your friend
Here's sponsor.

587
00:41:35,258 --> 00:41:37,950
Well .. my checkbook
is right here.

588
00:41:38,490 --> 00:41:40,588
Just say, that I fill it up.

589
00:41:44,281 --> 00:41:45,892
I'm tempted, but ...
no thanks.

590
00:41:48,180 --> 00:41:51,835
Why so sure ...
that can solve the problem ...

591
00:41:51,836 --> 00:41:53,977
... When my engineers
say it is a hopeless case?

592
00:41:54,925 --> 00:41:57,403
Not sure but ...
I would try.

593
00:41:59,317 --> 00:42:01,752
You know, it has less than 2
weeks until race day?

594
00:42:02,101 --> 00:42:02,753
Of course I know.

595
00:42:03,526 --> 00:42:04,902
And yet both
do it yourself?

596
00:42:05,549 --> 00:42:06,159
Is.

597
00:42:06,160 --> 00:42:07,160
I admire that.

598
00:42:09,227 --> 00:42:11,854
The Orange Bowl regatta has
$ 10,000 as a prize ...

599
00:42:12,590 --> 00:42:15,117
... If you win, we divided
half and half, is that fair?

600
00:42:16,216 --> 00:42:17,440
No kidding, are you?

601
00:42:17,999 --> 00:42:19,371
No son, I'm not.

602
00:42:19,857 --> 00:42:21,161
Hey, what about that buddy?

603
00:42:22,050 --> 00:42:23,971
Okay, where would
working on it?

604
00:42:23,972 --> 00:42:25,147
Well .. at ...

605
00:42:26,559 --> 00:42:28,293
... In store for skis
hotel is good.

606
00:42:28,848 --> 00:42:29,959
Okay, it's all yours.

607
00:42:30,650 --> 00:42:32,051
- Thanks Mr Burton.
- Thanks.

608
00:42:32,457 --> 00:42:33,786
Hey let's move it.

609
00:42:34,235 --> 00:42:35,698
Maybe you can get
before the luau.

610
00:42:37,421 --> 00:42:40,155
- What is the problem?
- You said the magic word.

611
00:42:40,156 --> 00:42:40,992
Luau?

612
00:42:43,069 --> 00:42:43,513
Yeah!

613
00:43:54,913 --> 00:43:56,543

614

Hi friend, get a trunk
and join us.

658
00:46:59,911 --> 00:47:02,223
- Still have a lot of food there.
- I can not stand any more.

659
00:47:03,060 --> 00:47:03,997
Hey, tell me one thing.

660
00:47:04,679 --> 00:47:06,871
I saw the boat towing
Burton to the hotel ...

661
00:47:06,872 --> 00:47:08,397
... Will turn it into a ski boat?

662
00:47:08,928 --> 00:47:10,931
Not exactly, I think of
fix it up for the race.

663
00:47:11,418 --> 00:47:13,286
- Are you kidding me!
- Really?

664
00:47:13,716 --> 00:47:16,083
Yes! That thing does not
endured when she was young ...

665
00:47:16,084 --> 00:47:18,211
... And do not improve with patches
made by an amateur.

666
00:47:19,311 --> 00:47:21,702
Well .. what I meant is that he is
doing a bit of his post.

667
00:47:22,296 --> 00:47:23,360
Why do not you do
only you know?

668
00:47:23,809 --> 00:47:24,810
You mean, do not mix.

669
00:47:25,258 --> 00:47:26,100
You could say that.

670
00:47:27,001 --> 00:47:30,209
Well .. thanks for the warning, but
if you please do not follow.

671
00:47:30,523 --> 00:47:32,563
I do not care, it will be good
for laughs.

672
00:47:35,146 --> 00:47:36,741
What about going
a treasure hunt?

673
00:47:37,849 --> 00:47:40,544
- Treasure hunt dear? Where?
- Do not know?

674
00:47:41,267 --> 00:47:44,311
Outside, a pirate ship
sank with many ingots ...

675
00:47:46,830 --> 00:47:47,410
Chocolate?

676
00:47:47,910 --> 00:47:48,411
Gold!

677
00:47:50,612 --> 00:47:52,939
Sank during a hurricane
some 100 years ago.

678
00:47:53,574 --> 00:47:54,622
And still there?

679
00:47:55,161 --> 00:47:58,301
They say that on clear nights,
today, we can even watch it.

680
00:47:58,610 --> 00:47:59,302
They say ...

681
00:48:00,995 --> 00:48:02,944
- You can not ...
- Come I'll show you.

682
00:48:04,097 --> 00:48:04,545
Right.

683
00:48:07,366 --> 00:48:08,965
Hey! This is a good idea.

684
00:48:10,112 --> 00:48:11,483
Why not let us
search for treasure?

685
00:48:11,993 --> 00:48:12,484
Okay.

686
00:48:15,739 --> 00:48:17,764
You should get a girl.

687
00:48:18,172 --> 00:48:19,659
Ask him
has a sister?

688
00:48:23,034 --> 00:48:23,760
Hey come on!

689
00:49:01,188 --> 00:49:02,092
Hello Mr Burton.

690
00:49:03,337 --> 00:49:05,265
I see you are working
more than usual tonight.

691
00:49:06,005 --> 00:49:08,587
Can not help it if we want
those earning $ 10,000.

692
00:49:10,313 --> 00:49:11,486
I would not mind ...

693
00:49:12,788 --> 00:49:14,118
... Put much hope on that boat ...

694
00:49:14,119 --> 00:49:17,766
... After 10 years of trying ...

695
00:49:18,592 --> 00:49:20,768
... Thought I'd get to
drawing that could win.

696
00:49:21,289 --> 00:49:23,362
I think I got the error
is not in the drawing of him ...

697
00:49:24,206 --> 00:49:25,063
What do you mean?

698
00:49:25,516 --> 00:49:27,842
The hull broke because
protective covering gave ...

699
00:49:27,843 --> 00:49:30,289
... Pressure, look, you can
break it with your hands.

700
00:49:30,909 --> 00:49:32,067
And it will happen again.

701
00:49:32,502 --> 00:49:34,085
This is the best resin
I know.

702
00:49:34,744 --> 00:49:35,773
There is nothing more
robust market.

703
00:49:36,874 --> 00:49:37,989
Mr. Burton, do me a favor?

704
00:49:38,868 --> 00:49:39,390
Sure.

705
00:49:43,718 --> 00:49:44,764
Hit as hard as you can.

706
00:49:45,919 --> 00:49:47,552
- Crash?
- Sure, go ahead, knock!

707
00:49:49,895 --> 00:49:50,653
O well!

708
00:49:54,781 --> 00:49:55,705
What happened here?

709
00:49:56,204 --> 00:49:59,092
It's called "GOOP"
this is the abbreviation.

710
00:49:59,093 --> 00:50:00,819
The technical name is longer.

711
00:50:02,828 --> 00:50:03,767
Where'd you get that?

712
00:50:03,792 --> 00:50:06,099
In a place where I worked,
I studied engineering ...

713
00:50:06,561 --> 00:50:08,660
... And worked in a lab
after I graduated.

714
00:50:08,990 --> 00:50:10,561
Helped develop
this hardener.

715
00:50:11,948 --> 00:50:13,881
If it's so good, why
is not in the market?

716
00:50:14,177 --> 00:50:15,116
Not so good.

717
00:50:15,632 --> 00:50:18,094
If exposed to water, turn gelatin
is that exposure time is.

718
00:50:19,108 --> 00:50:20,442
So what's the idea?

719
00:50:21,627 --> 00:50:23,579
The company gave him, not me.

720
00:50:26,021 --> 00:50:26,580
Mr. Burton?

721
00:50:30,626 --> 00:50:32,335
Can I use your lab
for some experiences?

722
00:50:32,955 --> 00:50:34,749
I will work at night, so
I will not disturb anyone.

723
00:50:37,119 --> 00:50:40,584
You. .. think you could
work on it?

724
00:50:41,827 --> 00:50:43,096
I do not know, but I would try.

725
00:50:44,804 --> 00:50:47,675
My wife died long ago
while we have had children ...

726
00:50:47,676 --> 00:50:50,282
... Always felt for
not having a son ...

727
00:50:51,557 --> 00:50:53,182
... I do not feel much.

728
00:50:55,702 --> 00:50:58,157
Just make sure you locked all
before leaving, go to bed.

729
00:50:58,515 --> 00:51:00,239
- Thanks Mr Burton.
- Good evening.

730
00:52:16,910 --> 00:52:17,752
Coffee?

731
00:52:23,232 --> 00:52:24,321
Need more cream and sugar.

732
00:52:31,346 --> 00:52:32,410
What do you call that thing?

733
00:52:33,182 --> 00:52:34,842
- Swingarm.
- Swingarm.

734
00:52:36,139 --> 00:52:36,909
Distribution.

735
00:52:37,574 --> 00:52:39,259
Carburetor, swingarm.

736
00:52:40,202 --> 00:52:40,610
I know.

737
00:52:43,941 --> 00:52:45,768
I suppose I have to find
Sally on 10 minutes.

738
00:52:46,345 --> 00:52:48,081
- I'd better go.
- You can go.

739
00:52:48,481 --> 00:52:50,397
- Thanks for the help.
-Let it go mate.

740
00:52:51,167 --> 00:52:56,316
I think that from time to time, all
rich man must come down ...

741
00:52:53,771 --> 00:52:54,771
... And work side by side
with their workers.

742
00:52:56,843 --> 00:52:58,113
Very decent of you.

743
00:52:59,404 --> 00:53:00,452
You look kinda tired.

744
00:53:00,505 --> 00:53:02,207
Why does not rest
the rest of the day?

745
00:53:02,916 --> 00:53:05,299
Hey ... listen, I met a beautiful redhead ...

746
00:53:06,826 --> 00:53:09,768
... Would save it for me
but anything for a friend!

747
00:53:10,864 --> 00:53:12,353
No thanks, I am very
laboratory work.

748
00:53:12,666 --> 00:53:14,651
You can check whether
the package arrived yet?

749
00:53:15,083 --> 00:53:17,884
First thing, if you're there,
te mando quickly.

750
00:53:18,574 --> 00:53:19,685
Or in French ... "done."

751
00:53:23,113 --> 00:53:25,883
Hey buddy, there are only four
day for the race.

752
00:53:27,292 --> 00:53:28,685
Yeah, I know, thanks buddy.

753
00:53:30,274 --> 00:53:30,786
- Hi Tom
- Hi Di.

754
00:53:30,787 --> 00:53:33,999
I just saw Sally in the hall
looking for you.

755
00:53:34,398 --> 00:53:36,458
My goodness, this woman
do not leave me alone!

756
00:53:37,095 --> 00:53:38,311
And I love it!

757
00:53:40,512 --> 00:53:41,212
Hi

758
00:53:42,413 --> 00:53:43,013
Hi

759
00:53:53,298 --> 00:53:55,767
- How's it going?
- How are you and Jamison?

760
00:53:56,556 --> 00:53:58,654
Okay, I'll find it
docks in a few minutes ...

761
00:53:58,655 --> 00:54:01,216
... And a boat trip to
the club where we will dine.

762
00:54:02,045 --> 00:54:03,101
Sounds pretty romantic.

763
00:54:03,661 --> 00:54:04,811
Elee very romantic.

764
00:54:05,396 --> 00:54:07,212
But its proposals do not
include a marriage.

765
00:54:07,829 --> 00:54:08,868
Do not worry about it.

766
00:54:09,741 --> 00:54:11,560
On a recent night, instead
going to the club ...

767
00:54:11,561 --> 00:54:12,987
... He's gonna ask
to his room.

768
00:54:14,520 --> 00:54:16,007
Will put some soft music ...

769
00:54:16,008 --> 00:54:17,656
... And serve a perfect dinner.

770
00:54:18,477 --> 00:54:20,397
Pheasant caramel ... of course!

771
00:54:20,398 --> 00:54:21,398
And wine.

772
00:54:22,845 --> 00:54:24,421
And dessert, let's see ...

773
00:54:25,689 --> 00:54:26,664
Cherries Jubilee.

774
00:54:28,061 --> 00:54:28,823
And after that ...

775
00:54:31,511 --> 00:54:33,229
... Get there, you're in chat.

776
00:54:35,416 --> 00:54:36,708
Tom, what's the problem?

777
00:54:37,832 --> 00:54:38,509
Nothing.

778
00:54:41,452 --> 00:54:43,348
Okay, I'll see ya.

779
00:54:48,976 --> 00:54:49,649
Come here.

780
00:55:02,713 --> 00:55:03,150
Clean.

781
00:55:24,177 --> 00:55:27,636
Unless Jamison is blind ...

782
00:55:25,391 --> 00:55:26,391
... Maybe he sees the trees,
rather than the forest.

783
00:55:32,263 --> 00:55:32,809
Thank you.

809
00:58:08,099 --> 00:58:10,258
As director of research
and development ...

810
00:58:10,259 --> 00:58:14,390
... Is a function of my office to explore the
advantages of diversification ...

811
00:58:15,449 --> 00:58:18,598
... However, acquisition
to diversify ...

812
00:58:18,599 --> 00:58:20,848
... Is not a profitable venture.

813
00:58:21,627 --> 00:58:23,870
Therefore, it is my strong recommendation ...

814
00:58:23,871 --> 00:58:26,765
.. Accept the generous offer of
Allied Chemical's ...

815
00:58:26,766 --> 00:58:29,842
... And surrender all searches,
complete or not ...

816
00:58:29,843 --> 00:58:32,516
... Formulas and data
Our ill-fated search ...

817
00:58:32,517 --> 00:58:35,478
... By phosphate oxioctanóico glycolic.

818
00:58:36,713 --> 00:58:37,870
You mean the "GOOP"?

819
00:58:38,951 --> 00:58:40,841
Yes sir, was the
what I meant.

820
00:58:40,842 --> 00:58:44,862
If what was meant, then say,
do not confuse me!

821
00:58:45,653 --> 00:58:47,192
Ohh ... yes sir, no sir.

822
00:58:48,661 --> 00:58:49,380
Mr Hayward ...

823
00:58:49,381 --> 00:58:51,597
... Will return the
bottles you asked for?

824
00:58:51,598 --> 00:58:53,239
I include them in inventory.

825
00:58:54,565 --> 00:58:58,027
You confused me again?
What bottles?

826
00:58:58,559 --> 00:59:00,735
Remember? There are two
Ellie had days ...

827
00:59:00,736 --> 00:59:03,124
... Get the formulas in which
Scott worked before ...

828
00:59:05,664 --> 00:59:06,496
... To leave.

829
00:59:07,266 --> 00:59:08,097
Those ...

830
00:59:09,751 --> 00:59:10,806
Did what?

831
00:59:11,203 --> 00:59:12,725
I think I'm gonna be sick.

832
00:59:22,218 --> 00:59:24,641
Come here and sit,
I want to talk to you.

833
00:59:25,808 --> 00:59:27,094
Do you know where my boy is?

834
00:59:28,585 --> 00:59:31,286
Answer me woman!
Do you know where is my boy?

835
01:00:02,920 --> 01:00:06,117
It's Friday night then you
remain until after midnight ...

836
01:00:06,118 --> 01:00:08,694
... Can not ski all day
and work all night.

837
01:00:08,695 --> 01:00:10,471
I think I'm more
tired than I thought.

838
01:00:10,983 --> 01:00:12,699
I met his friend at the hotel ...

839
01:00:12,700 --> 01:00:14,214
... He told me he was
waiting for that package.

840
01:00:15,464 --> 01:00:15,910
Thanks.

841
01:00:15,911 --> 01:00:18,856
He himself would bring, but
her hands were busy ...

842
01:00:19,691 --> 01:00:22,342
... I think in a Sally,
and in another era, Ginger.

843
01:00:23,359 --> 01:00:25,776
They are the latest formulas when
was working in Hayward.

844
01:00:25,777 --> 01:00:27,393
He worked in Hayward?

845
01:00:27,394 --> 01:00:29,267
Do not remember what I said about the
employment in the lab?

846
01:00:29,710 --> 01:00:30,268
Ohhh yes.

847
01:00:31,633 --> 01:00:33,131
Why she left there, if
do I know?

848
01:00:33,132 --> 01:00:35,492
No, okay, I quit,
at least I think so.

849
01:00:35,910 --> 01:00:36,493
I understand.

850
01:00:36,494 --> 01:00:39,406
I mean, I really do not understand.

851
01:00:40,302 --> 01:00:41,078
One day I'll tell you.

852
01:00:41,404 --> 01:00:43,593
Fair enough, how's it going?

853
01:00:44,270 --> 01:00:46,239
I'll know better when trying to
... a little of that.

854
01:00:46,987 --> 01:00:47,640
Good luck.

855
01:00:58,800 --> 01:01:00,641
- Oh hello Mr Burton.
- Hello Tom

856
01:01:01,844 --> 01:01:03,362
It seems that
need a hand.

857
01:01:03,526 --> 01:01:06,289
- Need 10!
- Where do I start?

858
01:01:06,959 --> 01:01:07,981
Get there in the front.

859
01:01:07,982 --> 01:01:10,755
Just slide the brush,
because it is quite easy to apply.

860
01:01:11,891 --> 01:01:14,250
- This is it.
- Yes it is.

861
01:01:15,033 --> 01:01:17,466
- Do you think this will work?
- I think it will do.

862
01:01:18,508 --> 01:01:20,820
Think? You mean
not tested yet?

863
01:01:20,821 --> 01:01:23,764
I had no time takes 24
hours to harden.

864
01:01:24,293 --> 01:01:25,671
We do not have much
time before the race.

865
01:01:26,743 --> 01:01:28,372
Neither spare time
that could be wrong.

866
01:01:31,297 --> 01:01:33,691
As I said the other day,
must have confidence.

867
01:01:36,391 --> 01:01:37,872
Hello gentlemen, as
everything is going?

868
01:01:38,540 --> 01:01:39,581
You know what time it is?

869
01:01:49,640 --> 01:01:50,802
Partner does not pass inspection.

870
01:01:51,857 --> 01:01:54,811
... Look mate, you had to
be here two hours ago!

871
01:01:54,812 --> 01:01:56,249
Something about "I promise to help"?

872
01:01:57,166 --> 01:01:58,913
Hayward never return
back on his word.

873
01:02:24,374 --> 01:02:25,966

01:04:51,942 --> 01:04:54,292
Cigars ... cigarettes?

897
01:04:55,710 --> 01:04:56,293
Cigars?

898
01:05:00,540 --> 01:05:01,600
Can I help you sir?

899
01:05:02,847 --> 01:05:05,141
- Well how are you ma'am?
- How are you?

900
01:05:05,142 --> 01:05:07,374
- Okay.
- I asked if I can help you.

901
01:05:07,375 --> 01:05:09,233
Ahhh! Yes ..

902
01:05:11,062 --> 01:05:13,486
I suppose I like
some of these cigars here.

903
01:05:14,127 --> 01:05:16,957
I may be wrong, but you
must be the father of Scott.

904
01:05:16,958 --> 01:05:19,193
Hit on the fly!
Of course I am!

905
01:05:19,194 --> 01:05:20,590
You know my boy?

906
01:05:21,426 --> 01:05:22,858
Everybody knows his son.

907
01:05:24,045 --> 01:05:25,747
I see that the two
smoke the same brand.

908
01:05:25,748 --> 01:05:27,206
It is ... what?

909
01:05:28,484 --> 01:05:31,185
My boy has never smoked
a cigar in his life.

910
01:05:31,868 --> 01:05:33,029
He is my best customer.

911
01:05:33,138 --> 01:05:34,366
Ohhh really?

912
01:05:35,617 --> 01:05:40,142
So can you tell me where
it was at this time of day?

913
01:05:41,195 --> 01:05:42,589
I'd say ...

914
01:05:44,474 --> 01:05:46,523
... In four minutes you can
meet him at the bar.

915
01:05:46,524 --> 01:05:48,120
I'll wait for it to pass.

916
01:05:49,244 --> 01:05:49,921
At the bar?

917
01:05:51,165 --> 01:05:52,564
Buying drinks for everyone.

918
01:05:54,165 --> 01:05:57,021
The Florida weather makes things
very strange to people.

919
01:05:57,863 --> 01:05:59,952
He's ... uh ... smoke ...

920
01:06:00,973 --> 01:06:01,753
... And drinking?

921
01:06:05,002 --> 01:06:06,154
Anything else?

922
01:06:11,544 --> 01:06:13,913
It seems that I got
just in time.

923
01:06:16,475 --> 01:06:17,863
Here's sweetness.

924
01:06:18,724 --> 01:06:19,991
- Thank you.
- Sure.

925
01:06:22,433 --> 01:06:25,720
It seems that the father is
always the last to know.

926
01:06:28,577 --> 01:06:29,121
<i> Cigarettes </ i>

927
01:06:30,891 --> 01:06:33,272
<i> Cigars?
Cigarettes </ i>

928
01:07:12,478 --> 01:07:14,307
- How are you?
- How are you?

929
01:07:16,550 --> 01:07:19,230
A lady there in the south wing
said I'd find ...

930
01:07:19,231 --> 01:07:21,901
... A young man named Scott Hayward
Here setup, you know?

931
01:07:22,396 --> 01:07:24,276
She spoke the truth,
is his friend?

932
01:07:25,485 --> 01:07:26,553
We can say that.

933
01:07:27,292 --> 01:07:28,550
Then choose a drink,
on his behalf.

934
01:07:29,238 --> 01:07:31,614
For friends of Hayward,
booze!

935
01:07:33,956 --> 01:07:35,975
What a beautiful phrase.

936
01:07:35,976 --> 01:07:40,980
But it is not uncomfortable, just want to
a dose of your best whiskey.

937
01:07:43,176 --> 01:07:44,842
We can expect
Mr Hayward together.

938
01:07:46,327 --> 01:07:47,273
I know you?

939
01:07:48,349 --> 01:07:50,628
My name is Burton,
the Burton Boat Company.

940
01:07:51,701 --> 01:07:54,864
In three years, his company wanted
swallow mine, remember?

941
01:07:57,421 --> 01:07:59,132
Of course! I remember now.

942
01:07:59,755 --> 01:08:00,932
What happened? Thought
had an agreement.

943
01:08:01,562 --> 01:08:06,444
We had, until his hard head
beat with my stubbornness.

944
01:08:09,179 --> 01:08:12,903
My boy loves boats,
then wanted to give him ...

945
01:08:12,904 --> 01:08:15,747
... As one of its
birthday.

946
01:08:16,822 --> 01:08:18,030
I do not know what he would do.

947
01:08:18,348 --> 01:08:20,108
You appear to have
all it needs.

948
01:08:20,688 --> 01:08:23,954
Money to burn women
lives only for today.

949
01:08:24,555 --> 01:08:26,343
Wait, Mr. Burton,
one minute please ...

950
01:08:26,344 --> 01:08:28,444
... What's wrong
with everyone here?

951
01:08:29,542 --> 01:08:30,801
You know who this is?

952
01:08:31,062 --> 01:08:33,424
Why, certainly, is not
describing my boy.

953
01:08:34,581 --> 01:08:35,660
Seeing is believing.

954
01:08:42,403 --> 01:08:46,159
Well. ... Well and if I knew what
there is to see, maybe I believe.

955
01:08:46,916 --> 01:08:49,097
- Your boy Scott, right there.
- Where?

956
01:08:51,135 --> 01:08:53,203
There! There he is!

957
01:08:56,928 --> 01:08:58,827
- Excuse me.
- Wait a minute ...

958
01:08:59,348 --> 01:09:01,508
... That mean ...
boy is your son?

959
01:09:03,190 --> 01:09:06,526
You bet ... sir.

960
01:09:06,622 --> 01:09:09,423
He is the hotel's ski instructor,
His name is Tom Wilson.

961
01:09:13,695 --> 01:09:16,975
I have no idea what is
drinking cup in there ...

962
01:09:16,976 --> 01:09:19,350
... But one thing
I ceretza ...

963
01:09:20,144 --> 01:09:21,638
... I know my own son.

964
01:09:21,639 --> 01:09:23,637
Mr Hayward, I'd better
a little chat.

965
01:09:23,638 --> 01:09:25,510
After Mr. Burton, if not
I want to care ...

966
01:09:25,511 --> 01:09:27,215
No, now!
It's about your boy.

967
01:09:27,427 --> 01:09:28,216
Let ...

968
01:09:39,757 --> 01:09:41,687
Partner ...
was waiting.

969
01:09:42,674 --> 01:09:43,763
I want to meet someone.

970
01:09:44,290 --> 01:09:45,238
This is Gigi.

971
01:09:46,151 --> 01:09:48,768
Gigi, this is "monsieur" Wilson,
is my best friend.

972
01:09:49,300 --> 01:09:50,285
Although it is poor.

973
01:09:50,945 --> 01:09:53,924
- How are you?
- Enchanted "monsieur" Wilson.

974
01:09:53,925 --> 01:09:57,841
She speaks no English, I
teach you everything I know.

975
01:09:58,412 --> 01:10:00,148
- Oh really?
- About English.

976
01:10:01,213 --> 01:10:02,293
Please join us, Tom

977
01:10:02,294 --> 01:10:03,839
Yes, sit down, we are
very democratic.

978
01:10:04,471 --> 01:10:05,240
Thanks.

979
01:10:06,941 --> 01:10:08,723
- Want to dance?
- Yes.

980
01:10:29,380 --> 01:10:30,624
What says Dianne?

981
01:10:31,224 --> 01:10:32,912
You will love the view
in my suite.

982
01:10:33,528 --> 01:10:36,986
and put a pretty mellow song,
serve a J J Special ...

983
01:10:38,738 --> 01:10:41,556
- ... A breast of pheasant ...
- Caramel?

984
01:10:42,689 --> 01:10:44,796
Sure! And a good wine.

985
01:10:45,708 --> 01:10:46,788
And then, of course ...

986
01:10:47,836 --> 01:10:49,000
... My favorite dessert.

987
01:10:49,642 --> 01:10:50,915
Cherries Jubilee.

988
01:10:51,741 --> 01:10:53,010
How did you guess?

989
01:10:54,194 --> 01:10:56,801
Women's intuition, I
get my purse.

990
01:11:02,725 --> 01:11:03,825
Well, good night all.

991
01:11:04,155 --> 01:11:05,126
See you tomorrow.

992
01:11:20,564 --> 01:11:22,176
If you'll excuse me,
I'm saying goodbye.

993
01:11:22,177 --> 01:11:23,258
Wait a second there.

994
01:11:31,971 --> 01:11:32,859
You know what that means?

995
01:11:32,860 --> 01:11:34,741
Yes, it means "goodbye and good
luck to my head. "

996
01:11:39,545 --> 01:11:41,014
- Tom
- Mr Burton.

997
01:11:41,015 --> 01:11:42,081
- Collecting up early?
- Is.

998
01:11:42,535 --> 01:11:43,853
- Have a good night and sleep well.
- I will try.

999
01:11:43,854 --> 01:11:47,728
- It's not going to check it out on the boat?
- I checked a few hours.

1000
01:11:48,218 --> 01:11:50,120
One last time will not hurt.

1001
01:11:50,121 --> 01:11:52,371
Never know what you can find,
if very meticulous.

1002
01:11:53,101 --> 01:11:54,551
You better take a look,
do it for me.

1003
01:11:55,057 --> 01:11:55,524
I'll look.

1004
01:12:31,718 --> 01:12:34,557
He knew that entered this
boat race tomorrow.

1005
01:12:36,070 --> 01:12:36,640
Father!

1006
01:12:38,216 --> 01:12:40,251
- Do you think wins?
- I hope.

1007
01:12:40,394 --> 01:12:43,985
One such said Sam Burton
who will share the prize, right?

1008
01:12:43,986 --> 01:12:45,355
It's great to see you, Dad.

1009
01:12:46,267 --> 01:12:48,031
Do not jump to conclusions.

1010
01:12:49,105 --> 01:12:52,240
He also said he did
all the work yourself.

1011
01:12:52,241 --> 01:12:53,657
- Is it true?
- Almost all.

1012
01:12:54,407 --> 01:12:56,438
Do you think he will
hold this time?

1013
01:12:57,971 --> 01:12:58,641
I think.

1014
01:13:00,225 --> 01:13:02,254
He is eager to take chances,
go there tomorrow ...

1015
01:13:02,255 --> 01:13:04,598
... Maybe kill himself, to find out?

1016
01:13:04,959 --> 01:13:06,685
It is, to find out.

1017
01:13:06,961 --> 01:13:10,036
Finding out about myself,
see if I can.

1018
01:13:10,585 --> 01:13:11,950
You know what Dad?

1019
01:13:12,408 --> 01:13:14,660
I would trade all that has
gave me for one thing.

1020
01:13:15,338 --> 01:13:18,067
- Why trust me.
- What are you saying son?

1021
01:13:20,209 --> 01:13:23,001
I've always trusted, just tried
facilitate things a bit.

1022
01:13:23,002 --> 01:13:25,011
That father, do not want to facilitate.

1023
01:13:25,012 --> 01:13:27,443
I make my own
errors and fix them ...

1024
01:13:27,444 --> 01:13:29,821
... Before you press the shutter button
panic, as it did in the factory.

1025
01:13:30,387 --> 01:13:30,822
Well ..

1026
01:13:32,075 --> 01:13:35,828
... Enough of this chatter
emergency button on ...

1027
01:13:35,829 --> 01:13:37,180
Trust ... and stuff!

1028
01:13:38,137 --> 01:13:40,786
Now I will hear a second
young fellow!

1029
01:13:41,127 --> 01:13:42,800
His firm spent,
from night to day ...

1030
01:13:42,801 --> 01:13:46,462
... 1 million dollars in "GOOP" or
"Gook," or what you call ...

1031
01:13:46,463 --> 01:13:46,697
... And we could not
make it work.

1032
01:13:48,111 --> 01:13:50,451
And now tell me who will leave
with this boat tomorrow ...

1033
01:13:50,452 --> 01:13:52,724
... Win, lose, sinking,
stand if this thing ...

1034
01:13:52,725 --> 01:13:55,357
... Then have gone ahead
eprovado something?

1035
01:13:55,358 --> 01:13:56,141
That's right!

1036
01:13:56,142 --> 01:13:59,546
Let me tell you something,
whether you like it or not.

1037
01:14:00,052 --> 01:14:01,469
I want you to know that ...

1038
01:14:02,603 --> 01:14:05,088
... I'm so proud of you
as a father who has never ...

1039
01:14:06,038 --> 01:14:08,509
... Botado both feet in
that was freaking my God. "

1040
01:14:08,510 --> 01:14:13,208
Thank you father.

1041
01:14:19,460 --> 01:14:23,018
I think we've solved
this very well, no?

1042
01:14:26,051 --> 01:14:27,532
I'm feeling
a little tired.

1043
01:14:28,932 --> 01:14:31,272
How about with me
back to my hotel?

1044
01:14:32,382 --> 01:14:33,225
We will be glad father.

1045
01:15:03,535 --> 01:15:06,190
What a beautiful room!
Very exotic.

1046
01:15:06,191 --> 01:15:07,275
Have to be.

1047
01:15:07,276 --> 01:15:09,860
It is called the Sultan's suite,
I get it every year.

1048
01:15:09,861 --> 01:15:11,463
Where guarding his harem?

1049
01:15:11,464 --> 01:15:13,464
Where did you get a
idea like this?

1050
01:15:14,173 --> 01:15:14,865
As we ...

1051
01:15:20,185 --> 01:15:21,895
I agree that I have acted
middle playboy ...

1052
01:15:23,182 --> 01:15:24,939
- Just a little.
- But it's over.

1053
01:15:26,233 --> 01:15:28,298
Now .. I need is ...

1054
01:15:29,406 --> 01:15:30,985
... The warmth of fellowship ...

1055
01:15:32,662 --> 01:15:34,039
.. Escape from loneliness ...

1056
01:15:36,301 --> 01:15:38,335
... The simple beauty
What a girl ...

1057
01:15:39,432 --> 01:15:40,894
... The right girl can offer.

1058
01:15:49,335 --> 01:15:52,129
James ... there's someone knocking at the door ...

1059
01:15:59,676 --> 01:16:01,401
Mr Jamison laundry.

1060
01:16:01,856 --> 01:16:04,073
- Excuse me for hours, but ...
- Thank you.

1061
01:16:04,074 --> 01:16:05,074
I called, but ...

1062
01:16:07,567 --> 01:16:08,075
Now ...

1063
01:16:10,238 --> 01:16:13,142
- Where were we?
- Escaping loneliness.

1064
01:16:14,067 --> 01:16:16,241
Yes, esca ... escaping the loneliness ...

1065
01:16:17,853 --> 01:16:19,788
... The simple beauty of a girl ...

1066
01:16:21,340 --> 01:16:22,525
... The right girl
can offer.

1067
01:16:23,263 --> 01:16:24,268
You've said it.

1068
01:16:28,899 --> 01:16:32,850
Here, 26D, Duster.
Am I right?

1069
01:16:32,851 --> 01:16:33,535
That's right.

1070
01:16:35,630 --> 01:16:39,569
Well son, I will be with
you every step you take.

1071
01:16:39,570 --> 01:16:41,924
- You know that right?
- Now I know father.

1072
01:16:42,577 --> 01:16:43,225
Thanks.

1073
01:16:43,826 --> 01:16:44,226
Good night.

1074
01:16:44,227 --> 01:16:45,227
Good night.

1075
01:17:40,532 --> 01:17:43,218
- I need to breathe.
- It's not the reason.

1076
01:17:43,701 --> 01:17:44,710
No, it is not.

1077
01:17:45,898 --> 01:17:49,822
Dianne .. I mentioned this?

1078
01:17:51,027 --> 01:17:53,500
- What gift?
- What should I give you.

1079
01:17:55,974 --> 01:17:59,437
It's a little something to ...
use this finger ...

1080
01:18:00,663 --> 01:18:02,153
... With about 5 carats.

1081
01:18:04,186 --> 01:18:05,504
I'm asking
marry me.

1082
01:18:12,112 --> 01:18:15,026
If I knew how
I waited for this moment ...

1083
01:18:17,528 --> 01:18:18,474
James, please!

1084
01:18:19,360 --> 01:18:21,185
James will have a
big day tomorrow.

1085
01:18:24,227 --> 01:18:25,216
And a great night tonight.

1086
01:18:29,939 --> 01:18:32,021
<i> - What is it?
- He brought his ski. </ I>

1087
01:18:32,022 --> 01:18:34,419
- What?
- Get your ski ...

1088
01:18:34,420 --> 01:18:37,377
- ... And I would return it.
You know what time it is?

1089
01:18:37,378 --> 01:18:40,666
<i> Sure! Gave me 10 bucks so
I thought it would hurry. </ i>

1090
01:18:40,958 --> 01:18:42,002
James, I'll let it go.

1091
01:18:42,127 --> 01:18:43,389
No! N.. N.. No!

1092
01:18:45,573 --> 01:18:46,647
Also ...

1093
01:18:47,922 --> 01:18:50,005
- I gotta go.
- Go? Why?

1094
01:18:50,006 --> 01:18:51,864
- We were just ...
- Just going to say goodnight.

1095
01:18:53,280 --> 01:18:55,884
Ohh! Forgive me, I hope
not have come at a bad time.

1096
01:18:55,885 --> 01:18:57,046
Actually interrupted.

1097
01:18:57,146 --> 01:18:59,251
No Tom, all right, James
and I were just ...

1098
01:18:59,252 --> 01:19:01,389
No matter, it will
the first to know ...

1099
01:19:01,390 --> 01:19:02,717
Tomorrow we will get a ring ...

1100
01:19:03,109 --> 01:19:04,589
... A double celebration ...

1101
01:19:05,070 --> 01:19:07,040
... For first win
the race, and second ...

1102
01:19:07,769 --> 01:19:09,223
... Will announce tomorrow
our engagement.

1103
01:19:11,226 --> 01:19:12,179
Congratulations.

1104
01:19:14,162 --> 01:19:14,881
Thank you.

1105
01:19:19,446 --> 01:19:21,985
- Thanks for the evening.
- Sweet dreams baby.

1106
01:19:28,566 --> 01:19:29,388
You know something?

1107
01:19:30,506 --> 01:19:31,769

<i> Wait a minute! It seems that Wilson

Congratulations to Tom Wilson!

1300
01:34:04,185 --> 01:34:06,784
The award
will be tonight ...

1301
01:34:06,785 --> 01:34:09,323
... In the great hall of the Hotel Shores.

1302
01:34:14,295 --> 01:34:16,032
You did it!
Got it!

1303
01:34:16,963 --> 01:34:17,831
Man that boat!

1304
01:34:19,338 --> 01:34:22,602
To see you ripping up the last curve,
I swore that you were born for this!

1305
01:34:22,603 --> 01:34:23,659
Time of celebration!

1306
01:34:23,660 --> 01:34:24,276
Yeah!

1307
01:34:25,186 --> 01:34:26,443
His father is really proud.

1308
01:34:27,166 --> 01:34:30,168
Need to see it distributed cigars
as a first-time parent ...

1309
01:34:30,169 --> 01:34:32,655
... And bragging.
And Sam Burton said ...

1310
01:34:32,656 --> 01:34:35,745
... The "GOOP" will be the most successful
market, since their bikinis.

1311
01:34:40,207 --> 01:34:42,504
- Your health friend.
- On your own, buddy.

1312
01:34:46,561 --> 01:34:47,613
Something wrong?

1313
01:34:48,151 --> 01:34:49,709
No, I'm just
expecting a call.

1314
01:34:50,126 --> 01:34:52,747
You may have to receive
trophy at dinner tonight.

1315
01:34:52,748 --> 01:34:53,810
Now wait a minute!

1316
01:34:53,811 --> 01:34:56,722
No sir, no! You won
the trophy and will welcome you!

1317
01:34:57,020 --> 01:35:00,712
He proved what he wanted, it's time to
back to being what we are.

1318
01:35:01,609 --> 01:35:04,171
Also, I wonder if
Sally loves me for who I am or ...

1319
01:35:05,108 --> 01:35:05,834
... For your money.

1320
01:35:05,835 --> 01:35:07,291
I know what you
I mean, friend.

1321
01:35:12,135 --> 01:35:13,837
She's ready to go now!

1322
01:35:14,617 --> 01:35:16,410
Thanks Harold, to hold there.

1323
01:35:16,411 --> 01:35:17,411
Give me the keys.

1324
01:35:19,597 --> 01:35:21,051
- What's happening?
- I'll explain later.

1325
01:35:21,052 --> 01:35:23,001
- Now wish me luck!
- You are desired.

1326
01:35:23,002 --> 01:35:23,703
Thanks buddy.

1327
01:35:25,973 --> 01:35:30,102
Harold can please hurry?
I need a taxi.

1328
01:35:28,334 --> 01:35:29,334
Never been to Connecticut?

1329
01:35:29,335 --> 01:35:32,161
No, a taxi!

1330
01:35:32,162 --> 01:35:33,875
Does it have to go? A taxi?

1331
01:35:36,053 --> 01:35:38,914
- There it is!
- Taxi Miss?

1332
01:35:41,225 --> 01:35:43,999
Jump up, take you where you want to go,
courtesy of Scott Hayward.

1333
01:36:04,479 --> 01:36:05,908
Wish you did not
go away today.

1334
01:36:07,185 --> 01:36:09,103
In these circumstances I think is better.

1335
01:36:09,104 --> 01:36:11,769
And I expected to get
help to spend the prize.

1336
01:36:12,890 --> 01:36:16,442
Thanks, but should retain
money and not spend it with me.

1337
01:36:17,369 --> 01:36:19,405
Too late, already spent!

1338
01:36:25,180 --> 01:36:25,640
Tom!

1339
01:36:32,066 --> 01:36:35,007
Tom Wilson you have to
return this ring to the store!

1340
01:36:35,008 --> 01:36:36,682
Does that mean
marry me?

1341
01:36:37,723 --> 01:36:40,117
I mean, not
we, I mean ...

1342
01:36:40,118 --> 01:36:43,468
... This ring would pay the rent
a year plus expenses, plus ...

1343
01:36:43,469 --> 01:36:45,008
So you're saying that
marry me?

1344
01:36:47,762 --> 01:36:48,902
Of course I'll marry!

1345
01:36:59,809 --> 01:37:02,235
Dianne, I must confess something.

1346
01:37:02,236 --> 01:37:05,043
- About what?
- About my family.

1347
01:37:05,044 --> 01:37:07,011
I'm marrying you,
not with his family.

1348
01:37:08,736 --> 01:37:10,910
Well .. about me being
ski instructor.

1349
01:37:10,911 --> 01:37:12,023
Look dear, listen ...

1350
01:37:12,989 --> 01:37:15,762
... With winning and with the
I win, we'll be okay ...

1351
01:37:15,763 --> 01:37:18,502
... Just can not afford
stuff like this ring ...

1352
01:37:19,440 --> 01:37:20,702
... The more I
wished we could.

1353
01:37:22,909 --> 01:37:24,661
You see that
oil field there?

1354
01:37:27,128 --> 01:37:29,877
Got a tenfold
when I was 21 years.

1355
01:37:31,302 --> 01:37:32,478
Ten times?

1356
01:37:40,242 --> 01:37:41,461
You see that yacht?

1357
01:37:44,467 --> 01:37:46,838
I won one just like the
my last birthday.

1358
01:37:48,049 --> 01:37:49,105
You know what I think?

1359
01:37:49,971 --> 01:37:52,703
I think I drive the car of Scott
're doing you have delusions.

1360
01:37:53,478 --> 01:37:54,650
That's what I'm saying.

1361
01:37:55,172 --> 01:37:56,624
- What?
- It's who I am.

1362
01:37:57,047 --> 01:37:57,625
Who?

1363
01:37:58,920 --> 01:37:59,984
I'm Scott Hayward.

1364
01:38:00,762 --> 01:38:04,699
And I'm Fiegledopper Hortense,
wants to talk seriously, please?

1365
01:38:05,221 --> 01:38:06,949
Look .. see for herself.

1366
01:38:16,106 --> 01:38:18,747
Well, it all started on the way here,
I stopped at this restaurant ...

1367
01:38:18,748 --> 01:38:21,957
... Where I met Scott ...
Tom, Tom the real ..

1368
01:38:23,468 --> 01:38:25,760
Dianne ... Dianne, are you okay?

1369
01:38:25,761 --> 01:38:27,296
Sorry to be rich.

1370
01:38:27,297 --> 01:38:29,289
If I said something that hurt you.

1371
01:38:29,290 --> 01:38:31,362
I swear I can explain everything.

1372
01:38:31,363 --> 01:38:33,850
Like I said, I stopped in
one of my posts ...

1373
01:38:33,851 --> 01:38:35,924
I mean ... our posts ...

1374
01:38:35,925 --> 01:38:39,913
... And while I fill the tank,
I went to get coffee and a sandwich ...

1375
01:38:39,914 --> 01:38:40,914
... That's where I met Scott,
or rather, Tom ..
