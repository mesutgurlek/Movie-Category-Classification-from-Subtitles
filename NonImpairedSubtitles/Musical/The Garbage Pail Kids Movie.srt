Quiet! Someone might hear us!

11
00:03:24,117 --> 00:03:25,607
Turn off the lights

12
00:03:26,152 --> 00:03:28,450
I'll get it.

13
00:03:31,324 --> 00:03:32,484
I got it!

14
00:03:34,094 --> 00:03:36,358
Now I can't see anything!

15
00:03:36,963 --> 00:03:39,659
You'll get use to it in
a few seconds...

16
00:04:12,065 --> 00:04:14,226
What is going on up there?

17
00:04:16,570 --> 00:04:17,662
It's him...

18
00:04:17,737 --> 00:04:21,605
If I'll catch anybody out here...
I'll be very surprised.

19
00:04:29,349 --> 00:04:30,577
I wonder...

20
00:04:34,254 --> 00:04:37,485
This should keep a lid on things
for the rest of the month.

21
00:04:44,664 --> 00:04:46,029
Take it off.

22
00:04:46,099 --> 00:04:48,329
- I'm trying...
- Shh...

23
00:04:48,668 --> 00:04:50,295
This is hard.

24
00:04:55,642 --> 00:04:57,906
I wanna get out and play!

25
00:05:34,848 --> 00:05:36,509
Okay creep... gimme.

26
00:05:36,950 --> 00:05:38,349
I don't have any money!

27
00:05:38,418 --> 00:05:40,943
If he ain't got money,
he ain't got nothing.

28
00:05:41,921 --> 00:05:44,856
- You're running out of time , creep.
- No , please!

29
00:05:44,924 --> 00:05:46,858
Little baby's gonna cry?

30
00:05:47,594 --> 00:05:48,686
Wally.

31
00:05:52,499 --> 00:05:53,693
Let go!

32
00:05:54,434 --> 00:05:57,870
Those are my kind of guys...
real psychos.

33
00:05:58,772 --> 00:06:00,933
Stop it Blythe...
Juice is mine.

34
00:06:02,308 --> 00:06:04,401
Come here... right here.

35
00:06:04,611 --> 00:06:06,977
- What are you doing?
- Put him down.

36
00:06:09,649 --> 00:06:11,617
What are you gonna do to me?

37
00:06:15,055 --> 00:06:16,113
Drop him.

38
00:06:16,322 --> 00:06:17,584
No no no!

39
00:06:20,260 --> 00:06:23,252
Thanks a lot , kid.
We appreciate the donation.

40
00:06:39,512 --> 00:06:41,241
Okay baby , let's go.

- Manzini's Antiques -

42
00:07:04,204 --> 00:07:07,037
Good lord! You smell like
a...

43
00:07:07,507 --> 00:07:08,906
I had an accident.

44
00:07:09,676 --> 00:07:10,904
Come , boy.

45
00:07:13,613 --> 00:07:16,844
We better clean you up
before the flies get.

46
00:07:17,717 --> 00:07:21,153
Captain Manzini, what do
you use for that garbage pill?

47
00:07:22,255 --> 00:07:25,383
- How long have you worked for me , boy?
- Couple of months.

48
00:07:25,458 --> 00:07:28,518
Have I ever forbid you to
touch any of my treasures?

49
00:07:29,896 --> 00:07:32,660
- This is the one exception.
- Yes sir.

50
00:07:32,732 --> 00:07:35,530
Did you get the blood of a toad
and the eye of a newt?

51
00:07:35,602 --> 00:07:38,093
No . There's no catch for
unicorns too.

52
00:07:38,171 --> 00:07:40,935
No wonder there's no magic
in the world today.

53
00:07:41,007 --> 00:07:42,634
You can't get the ingredients.

54
00:07:42,709 --> 00:07:45,234
- Here , try this on.
- A dress?

55
00:07:45,311 --> 00:07:48,303
Only to western life...
This is a dashiki.

56
00:07:48,381 --> 00:07:51,782
Given me by the great african
tribal leader from Tuh-Tuh...

57
00:07:52,285 --> 00:07:55,379
in gratitude for making
his mother-in-law disappear.

58
00:07:55,755 --> 00:07:57,347
You were in Africa?

59
00:07:57,423 --> 00:07:59,721
Actually , I was on my way back from Egypt.

60
00:07:59,793 --> 00:08:02,990
I was doing a split week in
Cleveland and Cairo.

61
00:08:03,563 --> 00:08:05,531
But that's a long story.

62
00:08:07,300 --> 00:08:09,530
Are you gonna tell me what happened?

63
00:08:09,903 --> 00:08:11,803
I got in a fight.
I lost.

64
00:08:12,338 --> 00:08:14,431
Losing is relative , my dear boy.

65
00:08:14,641 --> 00:08:17,405
What matters is conceding with grace.

66
00:08:19,712 --> 00:08:22,272
- Who did this to you?
- Some guys.

67
00:08:23,216 --> 00:08:26,413
Some guys...
Did you reported to the police?

68
00:08:26,486 --> 00:08:30,013
Last guy who snitched on Juice
got poured into the westside highway.

69
00:08:30,089 --> 00:08:31,283
Really?

70
00:08:32,826 --> 00:08:36,956
Which is broth than vampire's broom
make this clothes as good as new.

71
00:08:40,333 --> 00:08:42,028
Let's go do some work.

72
00:08:45,205 --> 00:08:46,638
Do you sell much of this stuff?

73
00:08:46,706 --> 00:08:49,402
We only had 2 costumers,
and they didn't buy anything.

74
00:08:49,475 --> 00:08:53,172
Patiance is a dear divine,
it's their sweet fruit.

75
00:08:54,414 --> 00:08:58,214
That's from the greek ,
it loses something in translation.

76
00:08:58,284 --> 00:09:01,253
Now... let's add a little sparkle
into our merchandise.

77
00:09:02,021 --> 00:09:04,455
Funny people should call it
junk , isn't it?

78
00:09:04,524 --> 00:09:08,187
When every single piece , is a...
is a diary into the human spirit.

79
00:09:08,261 --> 00:09:09,660
Take this , for instance.

80
00:09:09,729 --> 00:09:11,924
"To my darling Mary , From Herbert."

81
00:09:12,198 --> 00:09:15,463
This is not a modern book.
This is a testimony for love.

82
00:09:15,835 --> 00:09:17,029
And this?

83
00:09:18,004 --> 00:09:20,564
Yet the child who slept
with this...

84
00:09:20,640 --> 00:09:22,938
grow up to shake the world.

85
00:09:23,009 --> 00:09:25,034
Tell me about this,
Captain Manzini.

86
00:09:25,111 --> 00:09:27,545
An early form of air conditioning.

87
00:09:28,548 --> 00:09:30,709
Also a tool of romance.

88
00:09:30,850 --> 00:09:33,375
It could backen or to buff.

89
00:09:34,654 --> 00:09:36,349
Did you ever get backen?

90
00:09:36,422 --> 00:09:38,322
Yes . I also got rebuffed.

91
00:09:38,958 --> 00:09:41,984
But , like me , this is a relic
from a simply...

92
00:09:42,061 --> 00:09:44,393
good and bad ,
black and white.

93
00:09:44,464 --> 00:09:48,025
When a man could set all his
differences with one of these.

94
00:09:48,368 --> 00:09:52,930
Then some damn fool invented gun
powder and a bigger damn fool split the atom.

95
00:09:53,406 --> 00:09:56,432
That's when I decided to leave
mankind to it's fall...

96
00:09:57,076 --> 00:10:00,568
and retire here into the world
of...

97
00:10:01,814 --> 00:10:03,611
- Touch'e!
- Dodger , no!

98
00:10:08,955 --> 00:10:12,857
- Have you ever heard of Pandora's box?
- Never heard of Pandora.

99
00:10:13,192 --> 00:10:15,387
Right . Clear this up.

100
00:10:16,262 --> 00:10:19,720
According to legend,
all trouble in the world...

101
00:10:19,799 --> 00:10:24,634
could squeeze into...
one tiny box.

102
00:10:25,038 --> 00:10:26,232
Okay?

103
00:10:26,940 --> 00:10:31,502
Along came nozy little girl called
Pandora , opened it up...

104
00:10:33,479 --> 00:10:35,276
and let them all out.

105
00:10:35,448 --> 00:10:39,714
- I don't understand.
- Think of this... as Pandora's pain.

106
00:10:47,160 --> 00:10:48,627
Look at that!

107
00:10:50,063 --> 00:10:51,428
Look at that...

108
00:10:52,532 --> 00:10:53,999
- It's so pretty!
- Look at that.

109
00:10:54,067 --> 00:10:55,159
- SALE -

110
00:10:57,036 --> 00:10:58,503
What's this thing here?

111
00:11:00,106 --> 00:11:01,630
That's pretty cool.

112
00:11:06,312 --> 00:11:09,406
Tangerine? You got a minute?

113
00:11:09,482 --> 00:11:13,077
- You want to come inside and take a look?
- Why would I want to?

114
00:11:15,555 --> 00:11:19,491
Captain Manzini got great stuff,
well, stuff you can use for your creations.

115
00:11:19,559 --> 00:11:20,719
Come inside.

116
00:11:27,700 --> 00:11:29,099
We got buttons.

117
00:11:37,443 --> 00:11:40,810
We got medals too.
They're really good medals.

118
00:11:40,980 --> 00:11:43,505
Put them on, it's just...

119
00:11:43,883 --> 00:11:46,351
That's great kid.
What do you do for a hardcore?

120
00:11:46,419 --> 00:11:47,909
Open a vein?

121
00:11:52,892 --> 00:11:55,383
We got beads , we got great beads.

122
00:12:07,540 --> 00:12:09,735
We got...
all here.

123
00:12:23,689 --> 00:12:25,156
How much is this?

124
00:12:34,167 --> 00:12:36,192
Touch my woman , creep!

125
00:12:37,870 --> 00:12:39,565
No . I was...

126
00:12:39,806 --> 00:12:43,537
Come on , he's just a kid.
Not 12 years old.

127
00:12:43,776 --> 00:12:45,835
I'm 14! I'm almost 15!

128
00:12:45,912 --> 00:12:49,575
He's not worth the beating up!
Forget him.

129
00:12:49,816 --> 00:12:51,841
Come on , let's go have some fun.

130
00:12:52,351 --> 00:12:53,818
I wish I could help you baby.

131
00:12:53,886 --> 00:12:56,252
But the little creep must be
tought a lesson.

132
00:12:56,322 --> 00:12:58,222
It's a matter of principle.

133
00:12:58,324 --> 00:12:59,382
Oh yeah?

134
00:12:59,592 --> 00:13:03,028
I think it's just a matter of you
like to see people bleed.

135
00:13:58,017 --> 00:14:00,645
Yuch! It looks like a glue nose.

136
00:14:09,428 --> 00:14:11,760
You made a monkey out of me kid.

137
00:14:27,046 --> 00:14:28,411
What are you gonna do?

138
00:14:28,481 --> 00:14:31,314
I'm gonna send this little slime ball
on a journey.

139
00:14:32,318 --> 00:14:35,549
Oh come on Juicy baby no...
Let's go play.

140
00:14:56,742 --> 00:14:58,471
What are you gonna do?

141
00:15:01,681 --> 00:15:03,615
Why won't you just leave him alone?

142
00:15:03,683 --> 00:15:05,173
Shut up. Get down.

143
00:15:05,251 --> 00:15:07,048
No! Please don't!

144
00:15:09,088 --> 00:15:10,749
What are you doing?

145
00:15:10,823 --> 00:15:13,121
Why won't you just leave me alone?

146
00:15:13,192 --> 00:15:15,922
Don't touch me!
What is wrong with you?

147
00:15:57,803 --> 00:15:59,430
See you later , creep.

148
00:16:11,984 --> 00:16:14,578
Hey guys!
Turn off the water.

149
00:16:15,721 --> 00:16:18,087
He need a clean bad!

150
00:16:18,157 --> 00:16:20,682
Yeah . You don't smell too good either.

151
00:16:21,327 --> 00:16:23,261
What if he need a doctor?

152
00:16:34,907 --> 00:16:38,343
- FIRST AID -

153
00:16:38,411 --> 00:16:40,311
Hey , got any iodine there?

154
00:16:41,013 --> 00:16:42,105
Let's see.

155
00:16:43,949 --> 00:16:47,441
Yeah . Looks good too.

156
00:16:47,520 --> 00:16:51,456
- No! That's poison.
- Hey! Drink the red , you'll get dead.

157
00:16:51,524 --> 00:16:54,516
Well guys...

158
00:16:54,593 --> 00:16:56,356
Open him up!

159
00:16:57,596 --> 00:16:59,427
This will make him wake up!

160
00:17:03,636 --> 00:17:05,001
Put a cork in it!

161
00:17:05,404 --> 00:17:08,305
Are you okay? You sure took
a bad fall.

162
00:17:08,374 --> 00:17:09,705
What are you?

163
00:17:09,909 --> 00:17:11,433
What are we?

164
00:17:12,044 --> 00:17:14,638
- Same to you , buddy. Let's get out of here.
- Yeah.

165
00:17:14,714 --> 00:17:16,739
Let's go.

166
00:17:20,786 --> 00:17:23,448
Hey , get out of that chair.
It's the captain's chair.

167
00:17:23,522 --> 00:17:25,114
Leave the chair alone.

168
00:17:25,458 --> 00:17:27,050
Stop that please.

169
00:17:27,193 --> 00:17:30,890
Stop it you guys!

170
00:17:31,897 --> 00:17:33,330
You leave me alone.

171
00:17:33,399 --> 00:17:36,732
Put that stuff down , it's not yours.

172
00:17:40,840 --> 00:17:44,173
Put this back! Don't touch this!

173
00:17:46,712 --> 00:17:49,545
My god! It's the garlic!

174
00:17:51,517 --> 00:17:53,109
Put this back!

175
00:17:53,185 --> 00:17:54,982
Please , don't touch this!

176
00:17:57,857 --> 00:17:59,415
What are you doing?

177
00:17:59,525 --> 00:18:02,392
You did this?
How would you like to get stumped?

178
00:18:06,899 --> 00:18:08,491
Here.

179
00:18:10,503 --> 00:18:12,164
This is fun!

180
00:18:15,174 --> 00:18:16,766
My god.

181
00:18:17,943 --> 00:18:19,570
Attention!

182
00:18:22,982 --> 00:18:26,884
You let them out!
You let them out of the garbage can!

183
00:18:26,952 --> 00:18:29,887
- I don't know what happened , honest!
- You don't?

184
00:18:31,290 --> 00:18:34,123
Hi captain , long time no see.

185
00:18:37,029 --> 00:18:39,759
Alright children , we had our fun.

186
00:18:40,599 --> 00:18:43,432
Come on , back into the garbage can.

187
00:18:43,502 --> 00:18:45,993
- No way!
- No!

188
00:18:46,772 --> 00:18:49,400
- That can is jail.
- Yeah!

189
00:18:49,575 --> 00:18:53,033
You are forcing me to lay
very heavy magic on you.

190
00:18:54,613 --> 00:18:55,671
No!

191
00:18:55,748 --> 00:18:59,582
Dodger , I want the tooth of a crocodile,
a bottle of english fog...

192
00:19:00,119 --> 00:19:02,883
a hair of a goat,
the shadow of your smile.

193
00:19:02,955 --> 00:19:05,788
Captain , we can't get that stuff anymore.

194
00:19:06,192 --> 00:19:08,126
That's 20th century progress...

195
00:19:08,194 --> 00:19:09,855
We can put a man on the moon...!

196
00:19:09,929 --> 00:19:13,126
But we can't find a few simple
ingredients to do a magic trick.

197
00:19:13,199 --> 00:19:15,827
Alright... you took them out of
the garbage can...

198
00:19:15,901 --> 00:19:17,129
Say hello to trouble.

199
00:19:17,203 --> 00:19:20,229
Get them into the garbage can!

200
00:19:21,841 --> 00:19:24,901
You all greasy red.
Wanna rumble kid?

201
00:19:24,977 --> 00:19:26,137
No, thanks.

202
00:19:29,482 --> 00:19:31,382
- Messy.
- Hi.

203
00:19:31,484 --> 00:19:33,679
Don't shake hands with Messy Tessy.

204
00:19:37,890 --> 00:19:41,121

205
00:19:41,527 --> 00:19:43,188

206
00:19:45,831 --> 00:19:47,890

207
00:19:48,534 --> 00:19:50,365

208
00:19:50,703 --> 00:19:52,864
Not in this lifetime.

209
00:19:55,708 --> 00:19:57,266
I'm NAT nerd.

210
00:19:59,411 --> 00:20:01,140
Oh NAT.

211
00:20:02,281 --> 00:20:04,943
NAT is a baby!

212
00:20:13,025 --> 00:20:15,459
- Hi.
- Hi , I'm Valerie Vomit.

213
00:20:18,931 --> 00:20:20,694
Scared ya , didn't I?

214
00:20:20,766 --> 00:20:23,599
And this little green chappy is Ali gator.

215
00:20:32,645 --> 00:20:35,113
An eye ball is keep a doctor waiting.

216
00:20:35,180 --> 00:20:37,205
No thank you . I'm a vegetarian.

217
00:20:37,883 --> 00:20:39,350
How about a finger?

218
00:20:41,120 --> 00:20:42,451
A toe?

219
00:20:43,188 --> 00:20:44,849
Disgusting!

220
00:20:44,924 --> 00:20:48,121
I caused a lot of trouble,
didn't I captain?

221
00:20:48,861 --> 00:20:51,329
Somehow we gotta keep this kids
out of mischief until...

222
00:20:51,397 --> 00:20:53,991
we get them back in the garbage
can.

223
00:20:54,066 --> 00:20:57,524
First of all , we gotta get
you cleaned up. You could do a bath.

224
00:20:57,603 --> 00:21:00,003
No! No bath!

225
00:21:00,072 --> 00:21:01,869
Not you! Him!

226
00:21:04,176 --> 00:21:06,167
Come on.

227
00:21:12,585 --> 00:21:15,053
Don't even think about it.

228
00:21:20,192 --> 00:21:21,386
Darn.

229
00:21:26,398 --> 00:21:28,059
Prints off.

230
00:21:28,901 --> 00:21:30,163
Finished.

231
00:21:35,474 --> 00:21:38,034
- Here , for you.
- Thank you.

232
00:21:48,587 --> 00:21:50,350
He's a cute boy.

233
00:21:51,957 --> 00:21:53,948
Tasty looking toes too.

234
00:21:58,197 --> 00:22:02,827
We cannot choose the way we look,
but we can choose the way we behave.

235
00:22:05,504 --> 00:22:07,836
That's totally uncool.

236
00:22:10,943 --> 00:22:14,709
Now listen! Since you won't go back into
the can...

237
00:22:14,780 --> 00:22:16,748
You must at least promise me...

238
00:22:16,815 --> 00:22:18,840
Stay out of the Normis.

239
00:22:19,151 --> 00:22:22,518
- What are Normis?
- Normal people.

240
00:22:22,621 --> 00:22:24,680
We gotta hide from them.

241
00:22:25,324 --> 00:22:26,621
They hate us.

242
00:22:26,792 --> 00:22:28,487
Yeah . They think we're ugly.

243
00:22:28,560 --> 00:22:30,619
Ugliness is not in a mirror.

244
00:22:31,096 --> 00:22:35,465
Ugliness is cruelty, evil of spirit,
greed.

245
00:22:36,402 --> 00:22:39,735
To be blessed with unusual features...

246
00:22:40,272 --> 00:22:41,899
is an advanture.

247
00:22:45,244 --> 00:22:47,075
You think they bought it?

248
00:22:48,647 --> 00:22:51,377
- What a crock!
- Yeah , tell me about it.

249
00:22:51,450 --> 00:22:54,112
You couldn't chose a worst time
to come back.

250
00:22:54,186 --> 00:22:57,053
People are absolutely obsessed
about their looks this days.

251
00:22:57,122 --> 00:23:00,819
diating , joging , having everything
lift including their wallets.

252
00:23:01,160 --> 00:23:03,890
Well , I don't think you're ugly , exactly.

253
00:23:03,962 --> 00:23:06,089
- Wanna suck face?
- No.

254
00:23:06,832 --> 00:23:09,596
Well , I mean ,
I already love somebody.

255
00:23:10,069 --> 00:23:14,199
- Tangerine, now she is ugly!
- She's beautiful!

256
00:23:14,273 --> 00:23:15,968
You ain't gonna get her.

257
00:23:16,175 --> 00:23:17,642
He could with our help.

258
00:23:17,710 --> 00:23:20,201
Not with Juicy guy is in the picture.

259
00:23:21,046 --> 00:23:23,173
Yeah , well , that's a problem.

260
00:23:23,916 --> 00:23:25,508
Good night kids.

261
00:23:25,984 --> 00:23:27,417
Alright.

262
00:23:29,321 --> 00:23:31,312
Give me a little shoulder here.

263
00:23:54,980 --> 00:23:56,004
Hi!

264
00:24:00,719 --> 00:24:05,281
Look , I'm really sorry about
what happened yesterday.

265
00:24:05,491 --> 00:24:08,221
You know how Juice can get sometimes.

266
00:24:08,460 --> 00:24:10,553
- Forget it.
- Okay.

267
00:24:10,729 --> 00:24:12,856
Are you going out to meet him?

268
00:24:12,931 --> 00:24:15,092
No , he's got some business
to take care.

269
00:24:15,167 --> 00:24:17,158
I have my stuff to do , so...

270
00:24:17,236 --> 00:24:19,898
Let me help you...
help where you're going?

271
00:24:20,773 --> 00:24:21,865
Here.

272
00:24:22,608 --> 00:24:23,870
Yeah.

273
00:24:25,010 --> 00:24:29,174
Well , what I meant was...
where are you going with your... stuff?

274
00:24:29,248 --> 00:24:30,738
To the dance clothes.

275
00:24:32,251 --> 00:24:34,583
You wanna come along and help me?

276
00:24:39,691 --> 00:24:40,715
Sure.

277
00:24:46,465 --> 00:24:48,399
So what do we do when we get there?

278
00:24:50,035 --> 00:24:52,970
What do you mean?
Like , how do we sell the clothes?

279
00:24:53,038 --> 00:24:55,700
Well , you start at the highest price
you can find...

280
00:24:55,774 --> 00:24:58,971
for the clothing,
it may or may not have tags on it...

281
00:24:59,044 --> 00:25:02,104
- What are you doing?
- Calm down . It's under control.

282
00:25:02,181 --> 00:25:06,083
And then , if they won't go for
the price , we go down slowly but not too far...

283
00:25:06,151 --> 00:25:09,086
if they wanna take out more than 5$,
don't sell it.

284
00:25:25,037 --> 00:25:26,800
Hey wait! Tangerine!

285
00:25:28,941 --> 00:25:31,136
- Pretty stuff?
- Yeah.

286
00:25:31,210 --> 00:25:33,872
- Come on girls.
- I got all the stuff.

287
00:25:33,946 --> 00:25:37,814
- Wait wait wait... don't have it like that.
- What? It's still greek.

288
00:25:38,517 --> 00:25:40,644
No , I don't like it much.

289
00:25:40,719 --> 00:25:42,516
Okay , 14 please.

290
00:25:43,455 --> 00:25:45,616
Do you want that? that's 10.

291
00:25:47,092 --> 00:25:49,583
You want that? alright.

292
00:25:52,664 --> 00:25:54,757
Tangerine, you're doing great.

293
00:25:54,900 --> 00:25:56,800
I'm gonna sell my way out of this town.

294
00:25:56,869 --> 00:25:59,861
Someday I'm gonna be a famous fashion
designer from New York.

295
00:25:59,938 --> 00:26:01,530
New York?

296
00:26:01,740 --> 00:26:04,675
Or Hollywood.
They need designer for movies , no?

297
00:26:04,743 --> 00:26:06,404
Yeah , but that's a long way up.

298
00:26:06,478 --> 00:26:10,107
Well , I'm not gonna live at
somebody's cappy basement all my life , that's 12.

299
00:26:12,284 --> 00:26:14,946
- Hey , buy it or drop it.
- I'll drop this.

300
00:26:15,020 --> 00:26:16,783
Hey , how much for the shirt?

301
00:26:16,889 --> 00:26:19,016
- $12.
- Sold , let's go.

302
00:26:34,439 --> 00:26:36,498
Hot , doesn't it? Looks great.

303
00:26:36,575 --> 00:26:38,600
Okay , wanna hand me that t-shirt?

304
00:26:47,552 --> 00:26:49,486
Okay , you want this skirt?

305
00:26:50,222 --> 00:26:52,884
Okay , that's gonna be 10.

306
00:26:57,863 --> 00:26:59,831
- Tangerine?
- Get away!

307
00:26:59,898 --> 00:27:01,866
You got a bad attitude girl!

308
00:27:02,534 --> 00:27:04,866
Oh honey , you haven't seen bad yet...

309
00:27:30,862 --> 00:27:32,227
Hey baby.

310
00:27:39,805 --> 00:27:40,999
Get in.

311
00:28:41,333 --> 00:28:44,029
Hello! Is anybody in there?

312
00:28:45,237 --> 00:28:48,263
Hey! Ultra violet?

313
00:28:48,740 --> 00:28:50,640
Bannana Anna?

314
00:28:52,944 --> 00:28:55,606
We may never find our friends again.

315
00:28:55,981 --> 00:28:58,245
We tried . Now let's eat.

316
00:28:58,316 --> 00:29:01,717
- Maybe we should keep looking!
- Yeah!

317
00:29:01,853 --> 00:29:03,548
That's it! Let's eat!

318
00:29:03,855 --> 00:29:05,288
That sounds good to me!

319
00:29:05,357 --> 00:29:06,790
It's big out town.

320
00:29:06,858 --> 00:29:08,553
We don't have any money!

321
00:29:09,161 --> 00:29:12,153
No problem!
We'll carve an I.O.U.

322
00:29:12,230 --> 00:29:13,322
Yeah!

323
00:29:31,550 --> 00:29:33,575
Come back with my truck!

324
00:29:38,990 --> 00:29:42,050
All right! How are you doing down there?

325
00:29:42,360 --> 00:29:44,055

Get out of here!

372

Yeah.

374
00:32:55,253 --> 00:32:56,584
Hello, Tangerine.

375
00:33:02,294 --> 00:33:05,388
Wow! Where did you get those clothes?

376
00:33:06,064 --> 00:33:07,725

Well , some . Why?

383
00:33:34,059 --> 00:33:36,619

00:33:36,695 --> 00:33:38,686
You know , along with mine.

385

00:33:40,965 --> 00:33:42,330
I could try.

387
00:33:43,968 --> 00:33:47,301
You know , that jacket makes
you look... older.

388
00:33:50,208 --> 00:33:52,870
- How much older?
- Oh , at least 16.

389

00:33:56,147 --> 00:34:00,607
So , how many outfits can you

Dozen?

394
00:34:07,926 --> 00:34:10,053

00:40:37,915 --> 00:40:40,645
Something's loose.

488
00:40:41,219 --> 00:40:43,653
- No!
- I'll fix it.

489
00:40:46,824 --> 00:40:48,587
Don't touch it Messy!

490
00:40:50,094 --> 00:40:51,891
Now it works.

491
00:40:51,963 --> 00:40:53,828
Now it's broken!

492
00:40:54,699 --> 00:40:57,395
Well , anyway we should get back to work.

493
00:40:57,935 --> 00:40:58,924
No way.

494
00:40:59,003 --> 00:41:03,235
Yeah! All work and no play, no way,
it makes me irritable.

495
00:41:03,674 --> 00:41:05,665
What do you say we go out and play?

496
00:41:05,743 --> 00:41:09,076
I got a better idea.
Let's go see a movie picture.

497
00:41:10,148 --> 00:41:12,116
We can't go out.

498
00:41:12,283 --> 00:41:13,807
We'll get captured.

499
00:41:14,318 --> 00:41:16,252
No , we won't.

500
00:41:17,955 --> 00:41:19,718
What does she got?

501
00:41:19,791 --> 00:41:21,452
I made us these.

502
00:41:21,692 --> 00:41:23,216
Yeah! Costumes.

00:41:35,206 --> 00:41:37,697
Gee , I thought it was funny.

508
00:41:45,883 --> 00:41:47,043
Quiet.

509
00:41:57,295 --> 00:41:58,785
We go to the movies.

510
00:41:59,197 --> 00:42:01,427
We go where the action is.

511
00:42:03,835 --> 00:42:05,166
Yeah!

512
00:42:09,207 --> 00:42:10,834

Give the guy some push!

518
00:42:29,493 --> 00:42:31,552
Hurry up! Open the door!

519
00:42:32,396 --> 00:42:34,261
And away we go!

520

00:42:40,338 --> 00:42:41,805
What do you have?

522
00:42:41,873 --> 00:42:43,431
- We want...
- We don't have any more.

523
00:42:43,507 --> 00:42:45,566
All we have left is rabbit and hot dogs.

524
00:42:45,643 --> 00:42:46,667
- Rabbit.
- Hot dogs.

525
00:42:46,744 --> 00:42:48,735
Hot dogs! They'll take rabbit.

526
00:43:06,264 --> 00:43:07,663
Sit.

527
00:43:15,606 --> 00:43:17,096

There you are....

534
00:43:51,475 --> 00:43:54,205
When it comes to cooking,
I'm the catch-me-up.

535
00:43:54,278 --> 00:43:56,178

Yeah , this is it.

545
00:45:06,250 --> 00:45:08,047
Must be the place.

546
00:45:12,790 --> 00:45:13,916
Too skinny.

547
00:45:14,892 --> 00:45:16,018
Too bony.

548
00:45:16,927 --> 00:45:18,053
Too leathery.

549
00:45:21,899 --> 00:45:23,764
No.

550
00:45:26,737 --> 00:45:29,262
That is it... Yeah.

589
00:48:30,287 --> 00:48:31,845

592
00:48:41,398 --> 00:48:42,922

598
00:49:40,491 --> 00:49:44,291
As the natural leader of the children,
you are setting up horrible example.

599
00:49:45,829 --> 00:49:47,592
Thanks . I'm that kinda guy.

600
00:49:47,665 --> 00:49:51,362
In the whole universe , there's only one
place you and the children are safe.

601
00:49:51,435 --> 00:49:54,871
Wether you like it or not,
and that is in the garbage can.

602

Now , until I can find a spell that
would get you back in there...

603
00:49:58,542 --> 00:50:00,476
You are all in grave danger.

610
00:50:19,663 --> 00:50:21,528

611
00:50:21,598 --> 00:50:24,089
And reframe from eating people's toes.

612
00:50:27,738 --> 00:50:30,502
"And reframe from eating people's toes."

613
00:50:31,408 --> 00:50:32,500
Alright.

614

Now , don't you feel better?

615
00:50:36,714 --> 00:50:38,705

alligator?

618
00:50:46,590 --> 00:50:49,024
There's no time like no time...

619
00:50:49,093 --> 00:50:52,028
... or any time...

620
00:51:02,239 --> 00:51:06,471
- PRIME TIME TV -

Oh rats!

628

Why not?

629
00:51:55,793 --> 00:51:58,785
Rats and thunder wind and hale

630
00:51:59,496 --> 00:52:03,023
Send the kids back in the can.

631
00:52:04,635 --> 00:52:06,000
I don't understand.

632
00:52:06,136 --> 00:52:09,071
It's a basic Mary Poppins and
it's not working.

633
00:52:20,959 --> 00:52:22,859
There's something on his mind.

634
00:52:23,262 --> 00:52:26,095
- Yeah! A girl!
- And it ain't me!

635
00:52:26,331 --> 00:52:28,356
That girl , cut wat...

636
00:52:29,501 --> 00:52:31,196
That's uh... Tangerine.

637
00:52:31,870 --> 00:52:36,239
The world is full of great things,
but then again the chicks mess it up.

638
00:52:36,308 --> 00:52:38,401
- Thanks.
- No!

639
00:52:40,913 --> 00:52:43,848
Besides that girl,
what else is on your mind?

640
00:52:44,650 --> 00:52:46,015
- You.
- Me?

641
00:52:46,752 --> 00:52:48,117
Yeah , all of you guys.

642
00:52:48,186 --> 00:52:50,450
I'm worried about what's gonna happen to you.

643
00:52:50,522 --> 00:52:52,046
I wish i knew.

644
00:52:52,124 --> 00:52:55,218
- We're scared.
- Yeah!

645
00:52:55,560 --> 00:52:58,051
Scared our friends are gonna die!

646
00:52:58,130 --> 00:53:01,190
- Where are your friends now?
- We don't know.

647
00:53:01,733 --> 00:53:03,428
We just can't find them.

648
00:53:03,635 --> 00:53:06,069
We think they might be locked
up somewhere.

649
00:53:06,138 --> 00:53:08,106
In a really terrible place!

650
00:53:08,640 --> 00:53:10,870
In the state home for the ugly!

651
00:53:11,043 --> 00:53:12,601
State home for the ugly?

652
00:53:12,678 --> 00:53:15,078
I can't believe people would
make a place like that.

653
00:53:15,147 --> 00:53:16,409
Neither did I.

654
00:53:16,481 --> 00:53:19,575
I'm ashame to admit I never
tried to find it.

655
00:53:19,651 --> 00:53:22,779
I didn't wanted to believe that
such a place could actually exist.

656
00:53:22,888 --> 00:53:25,482
- Do you believe it now?
- Oh , now? Yes.

657
00:53:25,657 --> 00:53:29,024
I was quite happy to let life go
rushing pass my door...

658
00:53:29,328 --> 00:53:32,195
Closing my eyes to things I didn't
wanna see.

659
00:53:32,664 --> 00:53:35,497
But when you care for someone...
That's it , that's fine.

660
00:53:35,567 --> 00:53:38,001
When you care for somebody,
when you love them

661
00:53:38,070 --> 00:53:39,560
That's enough , Ali!

662
00:53:39,938 --> 00:53:41,838
That brings responsibility.

663
00:53:43,241 --> 00:53:45,869
This means we're gonna find the place?

664
00:53:46,378 --> 00:53:47,845
Settle up , partner.

665
00:53:48,280 --> 00:53:50,407
We're gonna find the home for the ugly!

666
00:53:50,482 --> 00:53:51,744
Alright!

667
00:53:56,221 --> 00:53:57,415
Kid bugs!

668
00:54:07,833 --> 00:54:10,097
Ninty nine , one hundred.

669
00:54:13,572 --> 00:54:16,166
Hey! Let go of me , get away from me!

670
00:54:16,241 --> 00:54:18,368
Oops! Our mistake.

671
00:54:18,443 --> 00:54:21,139
You shouldn't wear a mask
unless it's halloween , kid.

672
00:54:21,213 --> 00:54:22,942
No hard feelings , hey kid?

673
00:54:23,048 --> 00:54:24,515
Go suck a rope!

674
00:54:24,783 --> 00:54:26,944
Yeah...

675
00:54:40,565 --> 00:54:42,658
- STATE HOME FOR THE UGLY -

676
00:55:13,698 --> 00:55:15,928
There it is , the state home for the ugly.

677
00:55:18,136 --> 00:55:20,001
Looks like a prison.

678
00:55:20,105 --> 00:55:22,300
How do we find out
if the kids are in there?

679
00:55:22,374 --> 00:55:25,241
According to the great master Ying Lee...

680
00:55:25,577 --> 00:55:28,068
"The dusk falls like of the black birds' wings"

681
00:55:28,246 --> 00:55:29,736
You mean , we wait until dark?

682
00:55:29,815 --> 00:55:31,578
- Exactly.
- No , I can't!

683
00:55:36,254 --> 00:55:37,721
Give me.

684
00:55:47,132 --> 00:55:49,498
- Here.
- Gimme the ball.

685
00:55:52,237 --> 00:55:53,795
Wait up! I'll be right there.

686
00:55:56,208 --> 00:55:57,698
- Here he comes!
- Yeah!

687
00:55:57,776 --> 00:56:00,108
- He's here.
- I thought he'll forget.

688
00:56:01,213 --> 00:56:02,737
Here's all the clothes.

689
00:56:08,720 --> 00:56:10,483
- Let me help.
- I got it.

690
00:56:10,922 --> 00:56:13,322
- Thanks guys.
- See ya.

691
00:57:10,081 --> 00:57:13,573
So , can you make a lot of those
things for me?

692
00:57:13,652 --> 00:57:15,745
I've got big plans for us.

693
00:57:16,087 --> 00:57:17,349
Us?

694
00:57:36,341 --> 00:57:38,468
Bye baby , I'll see you in a while.

695
00:57:43,882 --> 00:57:47,079
It feels lousy , abandoning
my principles for money.

696
00:57:47,152 --> 00:57:48,744
- Principles?
- Yeah.

697
00:57:49,020 --> 00:57:51,045
Letting the little creep live.

698
00:58:15,947 --> 00:58:17,073
I saw Juice.

699
00:58:17,749 --> 00:58:18,943
Are you okay?

700
00:58:20,885 --> 00:58:21,874
Yeah.

701
00:58:24,789 --> 00:58:25,949
There he is!

702
00:58:27,425 --> 00:58:29,188
Come on. Hurry up.

703
00:58:35,700 --> 00:58:37,133
What's that?

704
00:58:39,337 --> 00:58:42,272
- Get away from me!
- These are my friends.

705
00:58:42,674 --> 00:58:45,905
Those ugly things? Yuck!

706
00:58:47,279 --> 00:58:49,270
Give them a chance! You'll like them.

707
00:58:49,347 --> 00:58:51,941
They made all the clothes
you're so crazy about.

708
00:58:52,017 --> 00:58:54,679
- You bet your toes we did.
- Ali , no!

709
00:58:54,919 --> 00:58:56,477
They made the clothes?

710
00:58:56,554 --> 00:58:57,714
Yeah!

711
00:58:58,323 --> 00:58:59,483
Sort of.

712
00:59:00,225 --> 00:59:01,658
Sorry, Dodge.

713
00:59:02,227 --> 00:59:03,353
Show me.

714
00:59:23,281 --> 00:59:24,441
My god!

715
00:59:35,193 --> 00:59:36,660
Mommy?

716
00:59:41,833 --> 00:59:42,822
Binaca?

717
00:59:42,901 --> 00:59:43,959
- BINACA -

718
00:59:49,607 --> 00:59:50,835
Yuck!

719
00:59:58,783 --> 01:00:00,808
Anything?....

720
01:00:00,885 --> 01:00:03,479
Dodger, baby , I gotta flash.

721
01:00:10,228 --> 01:00:14,096
Departments stores are gonna give us
a fashion show...

722
01:00:14,966 --> 01:00:16,866
A whole fashion show!

723
01:00:18,303 --> 01:00:19,998
Tangerine's!

724
01:00:20,105 --> 01:00:21,538
Tangerine's?

725
01:00:21,840 --> 01:00:23,705
Well yes, Tangerine's.

726
01:00:24,042 --> 01:00:28,479
That's for professionals ,
So all I'll do is sow my name and use staples

727
01:00:28,546 --> 01:00:30,411
I mean , you don't have a label... Do you?

728
01:00:30,482 --> 01:00:31,642
No.

729
01:00:31,716 --> 01:00:35,015
Okay , so let's stand the reason
that we need one , right?

730
01:00:35,420 --> 01:00:36,512
Yeah.

731
01:00:36,755 --> 01:00:40,054
- So we'll have to get started.
- Get started?

732
01:00:40,125 --> 01:00:43,492
Dodger, baby , don't keep sounding like an echo.
Catch up!

733
01:00:43,561 --> 01:00:47,588
Those things... down stairs.

734
01:00:47,799 --> 01:00:49,562
They gotta start sowing.

735
01:00:50,535 --> 01:00:53,402
But you gotta promise not to
tell anybody where they are.

736
01:00:57,842 --> 01:00:59,605
Cross my heart.

737
01:01:46,925 --> 01:01:49,519
I go for two toes and a finger.

738
01:01:54,866 --> 01:01:56,731
That was a tension breaker!

739
01:02:01,639 --> 01:02:03,231
I call.

740
01:02:03,341 --> 01:02:05,707
You got a poker face.

741
01:02:08,613 --> 01:02:09,739
Me too.

742
01:02:15,053 --> 01:02:16,247
What was that?

743
01:02:19,757 --> 01:02:22,157
Maybe I'll just raise a little.

744
01:02:23,328 --> 01:02:25,694
Hurry!

745
01:02:26,197 --> 01:02:28,961
Yuck! Cut that out.

746
01:02:29,133 --> 01:02:31,601
But I haven't finished the examination.

747
01:02:31,669 --> 01:02:33,227
Oh yes you have!

748
01:02:40,278 --> 01:02:41,905
You back again?

749
01:02:42,113 --> 01:02:45,480
We ain't doin' no work 'til
you keep your promise.

750
01:02:45,550 --> 01:02:48,041
You were supposed to help us
find our friends.

751
01:02:48,119 --> 01:02:51,850
- We need to go there.
- We still don't know where it is.

752
01:02:51,923 --> 01:02:53,015
Yes we do.

753
01:02:53,091 --> 01:02:54,251
- Who?
- We do.

754
01:02:54,325 --> 01:02:57,886
Captain Manzini and me... We found
the state for the ugly yesterday.

755
01:02:57,962 --> 01:02:59,554
And you didn't tell us?

756
01:02:59,631 --> 01:03:01,326
- You're...
- Hey!

757
01:03:01,399 --> 01:03:03,128
Don't get crazy.

758
01:03:03,301 --> 01:03:05,997
I didn't tell you 'cause we're
checking how to get in there.

759
01:03:06,070 --> 01:03:07,469
That place is a fortress.

760
01:03:07,539 --> 01:03:10,337
- What can we do?
- That's what I'm trying to figure out.

761
01:03:10,408 --> 01:03:12,433
- We'll need a plan.
- We need a miracle.

762
01:03:12,510 --> 01:03:14,375
- Yeah!
- We're working on it.

763
01:03:14,779 --> 01:03:17,043
And in the meantime , you guys could...

764
01:03:17,115 --> 01:03:19,845
Getting started with the fashion show?

765
01:03:19,918 --> 01:03:21,010
Yeah.

766
01:03:24,956 --> 01:03:26,446
Come on guys , please?

767
01:03:26,524 --> 01:03:28,355
Can you do it for me?

768
01:03:29,193 --> 01:03:31,991
- Alright , we'll do it!
- Alright!

769
01:03:32,063 --> 01:03:34,725
But if you don't check out
the home for the ugly...

770
01:03:34,799 --> 01:03:36,994
There will be a garbage on your
hands.

771
01:03:37,068 --> 01:03:38,194
And Dodge...

772
01:03:38,670 --> 01:03:40,433
If you cut out on us...

773
01:03:42,407 --> 01:03:44,534
I wouldn't wanna be your toes.

774
01:04:06,331 --> 01:04:08,822
Captain , shouldn't we be
sneaking in?

775
01:04:08,967 --> 01:04:11,299
Captain Manzini never sneaks.

776
01:04:11,369 --> 01:04:14,304
He advances the enemy and engaging head-off.

777
01:04:14,472 --> 01:04:15,598
Good evening sir.

778
01:04:15,673 --> 01:04:17,334
Nice little puppy you have.

779
01:04:17,408 --> 01:04:18,875
- WARNING , GUARD DOGS -
- NO TRASPASSING -

780
01:04:18,943 --> 01:04:20,740
Who are you guys?
What you think you're doing here?

781
01:04:20,812 --> 01:04:23,007
You gotta get out.

782
01:04:23,781 --> 01:04:27,046
Absolutely no visitors . You got that?
Now get outta here!

783
01:04:27,452 --> 01:04:28,646
Move it!

784
01:04:31,522 --> 01:04:34,355
- Captain , we are retreating.
- Nonsense.

785
01:04:34,425 --> 01:04:36,859
We are mearly advancing in different directions.

786
01:04:39,230 --> 01:04:40,925
What do we do now?

787
01:04:42,300 --> 01:04:44,165
We fall back and regroup.

788
01:04:59,717 --> 01:05:02,208
The captain and Dodger are gonna
find our friends!

789
01:05:02,286 --> 01:05:04,516
They are the greatest , yeah!

790
01:05:09,661 --> 01:05:11,356
- MCBUNDY'S DEPARTMENT STORE PRESENTS -

791
01:05:11,429 --> 01:05:13,294
- TANGERINE'S -

792
01:05:27,879 --> 01:05:30,541
Need any more models? I'll be
glad to help.

793
01:05:30,648 --> 01:05:32,980
Gee , no... We have plenty.

794
01:05:33,251 --> 01:05:36,015
- Anyway , sweety...
- Valerie.

795
01:05:36,487 --> 01:05:39,320
Anyway , Valerie,
Models have to be pretty.

796
01:05:43,961 --> 01:05:46,725
Pretty tall...

797
01:05:47,098 --> 01:05:48,656
Taller than you.

798
01:05:49,367 --> 01:05:52,359
Didn't mother ever tell you
not to make faces like that?

799
01:05:52,437 --> 01:05:54,871
Suppose your face froze ,
and you have to go through the rest of your life...

800
01:05:54,939 --> 01:05:57,305
looking just like...

801
01:06:01,145 --> 01:06:03,409
Maybe it wouldn't make that
much difference.

802
01:06:03,481 --> 01:06:06,041
But we don't have any mothers.

803
01:06:06,117 --> 01:06:07,880
Why am I not surprised.

804
01:06:07,952 --> 01:06:10,079
Tangerine. Come on, lighten up.

805
01:06:10,722 --> 01:06:13,555
Dodger, you look so cool tonight.

806
01:06:14,325 --> 01:06:17,920
Why , I don't even know how I
will be able to resist you.

807
01:06:18,262 --> 01:06:19,422
Later.

808
01:06:21,032 --> 01:06:23,159
Dodge. My man...

809
01:06:24,902 --> 01:06:25,960
Yeah , right.

810
01:06:26,270 --> 01:06:27,498
Gross.

811
01:06:28,339 --> 01:06:30,398
We want to go to the fashion show.

812
01:06:30,541 --> 01:06:33,101
You can't go out . You might get caught.

813
01:06:33,177 --> 01:06:34,405
No , we won't.

814
01:06:39,817 --> 01:06:41,045
What's this?

815
01:06:44,155 --> 01:06:45,520
Ho ho ho...

816
01:06:45,723 --> 01:06:47,350
We'll go as clowns!

817
01:06:47,692 --> 01:06:50,286
I don't care what stupid customes
they're wearing...

818
01:06:50,361 --> 01:06:52,158
They can't go!

819
01:06:55,733 --> 01:06:58,964
Supposed they are caught and
get sent to the home for the ugly?

820
01:06:59,036 --> 01:07:02,301
You wouldn't wanna have it on
your conscience , would you?

821
01:07:03,074 --> 01:07:05,065
- No.
- Of course not.

822
01:07:05,309 --> 01:07:08,073
So what we're gonna do...
We're just gonna take care of that.

823
01:07:15,386 --> 01:07:17,149
We're going to the fashion show!

824
01:07:23,494 --> 01:07:25,962
This is gonna solve the problem baby.

825
01:07:26,864 --> 01:07:28,161
Lock them in there?

826
01:07:28,232 --> 01:07:31,668
Right as the show is over ,
We'll rush right back.

827
01:07:31,736 --> 01:07:33,829
And we'll bring them a treat.

828
01:07:33,905 --> 01:07:36,703
Pizza , or something really revolting
if they would like it better.

829
01:07:37,809 --> 01:07:39,299
Where's the key?

830
01:07:40,111 --> 01:07:41,305
Right here.

831
01:07:43,047 --> 01:07:44,742
I won't lose it.

832
01:07:53,391 --> 01:07:55,291
We're going to the fashion show!

833
01:08:00,698 --> 01:08:02,791
The door is locked.

834
01:08:03,768 --> 01:08:05,565
I can't believe it!

835
01:08:10,041 --> 01:08:12,703
We wanna go to the fashion show!

836
01:08:13,477 --> 01:08:15,843
- Are you excited?
- Yeah.

837
01:08:18,049 --> 01:08:20,244
McBundy's! I can't believe it!

838
01:08:21,919 --> 01:08:23,910
It's gonna make me a star.

839
01:08:28,926 --> 01:08:31,224
We worked so hard.

840
01:08:31,295 --> 01:08:33,354
It's not fair.

841
01:08:35,132 --> 01:08:38,431
Forget this guy's toes.
They're history!

842
01:08:38,502 --> 01:08:39,628
It's okay.

843
01:08:45,176 --> 01:08:48,703
Dodger, baby , take my clothes inside
and start sorting them out.

844
01:08:48,779 --> 01:08:50,804
I'm gonna go park the car.

845
01:08:51,449 --> 01:08:53,781
I'll be back before you can miss me.

846
01:09:06,964 --> 01:09:09,933
I still wanna go to the fashion show!

847
01:09:13,170 --> 01:09:15,434
What is it? It feels so good.

848
01:09:18,743 --> 01:09:20,142
What can we play?

849
01:09:21,312 --> 01:09:23,371
Okay , we're playing baseball.

850
01:09:23,648 --> 01:09:26,139
- Three....
- Great.

851
01:09:26,517 --> 01:09:28,712
Let's see , now...

852
01:09:29,453 --> 01:09:31,284
Hey , that's not fair Ali!

853
01:09:33,124 --> 01:09:35,592
Let me break up the tension around here.

854
01:09:47,371 --> 01:09:49,305
Son of a witch!

855
01:09:49,573 --> 01:09:50,767
I think I got it!

856
01:10:14,031 --> 01:10:15,498
Holy toledo...

857
01:10:16,033 --> 01:10:18,001
We are closed for the day.

858
01:10:21,672 --> 01:10:23,765
Why don't you come back
in the morning and...

859
01:10:41,225 --> 01:10:43,750
Alright , I call.
Set them down.

860
01:10:44,495 --> 01:10:46,463
Oh well , I fold.

861
01:10:46,564 --> 01:10:48,657
A flush beats two of a kind.

862
01:10:48,866 --> 01:10:51,300
I guess I lose again.

863
01:10:51,369 --> 01:10:54,304
Get your hands away from me.

864
01:10:54,572 --> 01:10:56,130
Not so fast.

865
01:10:58,642 --> 01:11:00,041
Who cares?

866
01:11:00,778 --> 01:11:03,303
Some kind of friend
he turned out to be!

867
01:11:03,681 --> 01:11:05,239
Maybe he's hurt.

868
01:11:05,416 --> 01:11:07,941
Big bad boys... I'll go.

869
01:11:09,353 --> 01:11:10,650
I'll go.

870
01:11:11,122 --> 01:11:13,818
Yeah Greg . Give him a piece....

871
01:11:14,859 --> 01:11:16,690
Yeah , he'll be hurt for sure.

872
01:11:16,761 --> 01:11:18,820
Shit! The game was just
getting good too.

873
01:11:18,896 --> 01:11:21,592
Better be a dumb , 'cause I'm hotted....

874
01:11:24,869 --> 01:11:26,496
What's going on?

875
01:11:35,146 --> 01:11:36,408
Hello maam?

876
01:11:36,547 --> 01:11:39,414
Please , try to get the
order of my dresses right.

877
01:11:41,352 --> 01:11:42,979
And loose the gum.

878
01:11:48,893 --> 01:11:52,420
If it's not real... Don't use it.

879
01:12:01,338 --> 01:12:03,533
Hey , that's great... No!

880
01:12:04,275 --> 01:12:06,243
Alright , you better wear these.

881
01:12:06,310 --> 01:12:08,073
I'll get you some new nail polish....

882
01:12:09,680 --> 01:12:12,308
Oh honey , I hope this is not
your real hair.

883
01:12:14,652 --> 01:12:16,517
Okay , how's the crowd?

884
01:12:16,587 --> 01:12:17,747
Full house.

885
01:12:19,657 --> 01:12:21,682
Not bad for a start.

886
01:12:29,533 --> 01:12:31,524
- STATE HOME FOR THE UGLY -

887
01:12:45,316 --> 01:12:47,216
Here's the money , fella.

888
01:12:47,284 --> 01:12:50,310
You find anymore of them ,
you'll know where to put them.

889
01:12:56,660 --> 01:12:59,686
- So where are we off to?
- The fashion show.

890
01:13:04,368 --> 01:13:05,630
- TOO OLD -

891
01:13:06,270 --> 01:13:07,532
- TOO BALD -

892
01:13:12,810 --> 01:13:16,041
- TOO WEIRD -

893
01:13:16,213 --> 01:13:18,078
Alright , keep moving.

894
01:13:18,149 --> 01:13:20,515
Hey , I'm gonna report that to
the authorities.

895
01:13:26,891 --> 01:13:29,655
- Where are they taking us?
- Come on , come on!

896
01:13:31,162 --> 01:13:33,062
- Get in there!
- Don't push it!

897
01:13:33,998 --> 01:13:35,090
Get in there.

898
01:13:35,232 --> 01:13:36,859
I wanna go home.

899
01:13:39,103 --> 01:13:40,593
In there.

900
01:13:43,440 --> 01:13:45,408
Let us outta here.

901
01:13:49,180 --> 01:13:51,307
- TOO GROSS -

902
01:13:51,382 --> 01:13:52,906
Hey!

903
01:13:53,617 --> 01:13:56,245
- TOO HAIRY -
- TOO PALE -

904
01:13:59,490 --> 01:14:01,651
- TOO SILLY -
- TOO CRIPPLED -

905
01:14:02,226 --> 01:14:04,387
I didn't see any of our friends.

906
01:14:04,762 --> 01:14:07,356
Do you really think they maybe
locked up in here?

907
01:14:07,431 --> 01:14:09,865
We can't save them from here.

908
01:14:10,334 --> 01:14:13,269
Yo Einstein!
We gotta save ourselves.

909
01:14:29,753 --> 01:14:33,052
They're crying .
You want us to shut them up?

910
01:14:33,390 --> 01:14:35,915
- They'll be gone soon.
- What? Where?

911
01:14:42,333 --> 01:14:44,392
Like a big dump in the sky.

912
01:15:01,852 --> 01:15:05,083
I'm sure glad I got transferred
out of that laboratory.

913
01:15:05,756 --> 01:15:08,190
Did you see any experiments?

914
01:15:08,792 --> 01:15:09,986
Yeah.

915
01:15:10,594 --> 01:15:13,495
Those doctors...
They like to hurt people.

916
01:15:42,693 --> 01:15:44,684
Children?

917
01:15:45,262 --> 01:15:46,889
Windy? Ali?

918
01:15:49,933 --> 01:15:51,594
Oh my god!

919
01:15:55,306 --> 01:15:57,297
There you go , I found it.

920
01:16:04,715 --> 01:16:07,843
Why don't you just whistle for your
little friends , creep?

921
01:16:10,254 --> 01:16:12,245
You double-crossed them.

922
01:16:12,623 --> 01:16:14,488
No . You did.

923
01:16:15,492 --> 01:16:17,687
I just gave Juice the key.

924
01:16:20,064 --> 01:16:22,862
Where are they? Where?

925
01:16:26,837 --> 01:16:28,668
State home for the ugly.

926
01:16:37,648 --> 01:16:38,979
Lose him.

927
01:16:41,185 --> 01:16:43,244
- No!
- Come on!

928
01:16:47,558 --> 01:16:49,526
That's for coming out for him.

929
01:17:02,272 --> 01:17:03,398
No!

930
01:17:52,656 --> 01:17:56,023
If I'll see you around here again
I'll get you your own cage!

931
01:18:15,179 --> 01:18:17,044
I think they got the children.

932
01:18:17,114 --> 01:18:19,480
Oh no! We gotta get them out of there.

933
01:18:22,686 --> 01:18:25,621
Dodger, I think we might
be too late.

934
01:18:25,889 --> 01:18:29,154
Maybe! But we can still get
the bad guys. Go!

935
01:18:36,133 --> 01:18:38,533
Tonight McBundy's department store...

936
01:18:38,602 --> 01:18:41,469
is delighted to welcome you to the day view...

937
01:18:41,738 --> 01:18:44,502
of a truly remarkable young designer start.

938
01:18:44,942 --> 01:18:48,275
Iconoclastic , rebellious and original.

939
01:18:49,079 --> 01:18:51,104
Her clothes will make a speak.

940
01:18:51,715 --> 01:18:53,876
Tangerine's clothes to wear...

941
01:18:53,951 --> 01:18:57,785
When one simply doesn't know what
to wear to occasions which...

942
01:18:58,322 --> 01:19:00,290
It doesn't matter
what one wears.

943
01:19:06,396 --> 01:19:09,729
"Our designer star Tangerine...

944
01:19:10,067 --> 01:19:12,592

Tonight I would like to show you
a totally new concept to new fashions.

949
01:19:33,524 --> 01:19:36,493
A little flashy , a little trashy...

950
01:19:37,361 --> 01:19:38,487
but fun.

951
01:19:44,334 --> 01:19:47,633
Guys , I need your help right now.
Really , I need your help.

952
01:19:47,704 --> 01:19:49,672
Your little guys are in trouble!

953
01:19:49,740 --> 01:19:51,298

01:19:56,914 --> 01:19:58,711

Now don't worry . we're gonna
get you out.

958
01:21:42,052 --> 01:21:43,178
How?

959
01:21:44,655 --> 01:21:46,452
We'll think of something.

960
01:21:47,290 --> 01:21:49,383
Who are you? What are you doing here?

961
01:21:49,459 --> 01:21:51,120
I am the great Manzini.

962
01:21:57,768 --> 01:21:59,065

Let's go find the others.

979

I don't see them.

980
01:23:25,422 --> 01:23:26,411
- TOO SHORT -

981
01:23:26,490 --> 01:23:28,651
Where can they be?

982
01:23:35,332 --> 01:23:36,856
Dodge, how are you doin'?

983
01:23:36,933 --> 01:23:39,163
Captain , what about all of the
other children?

984
01:23:40,270 --> 01:23:42,363
Remember the garbage truck?

985
01:23:42,706 --> 01:23:44,139
We were too late.

986
01:23:44,207 --> 01:23:46,402
Just go and check out
that everybody else is out and safe.

987
01:23:46,476 --> 01:23:48,068
- Okay.
- Let's go guys.

988
01:23:49,946 --> 01:23:51,470
We're free! Yeah!

989
01:23:55,552 --> 01:23:56,610
Alright.

990
01:24:02,392 --> 01:24:03,381
Come on.

991
01:24:12,469 --> 01:24:13,766
Here we go...

992
01:24:16,773 --> 01:24:18,468
Watch the tail...

993
01:24:21,645 --> 01:24:23,772
We blasted them.

994
01:24:39,629 --> 01:24:42,029
Hey , it's okay , everybody's out!

995
01:24:44,234 --> 01:24:45,963
Alright!

996
01:24:48,572 --> 01:24:50,767
Thank you guys.

997
01:24:52,909 --> 01:24:55,434
Hey guys , thanks a lot!

998
01:24:55,812 --> 01:24:56,904
Thank you.

999
01:24:57,214 --> 01:24:59,273
- Now , are we all here?
- Yeah!

1000
01:24:59,349 --> 01:25:01,374
Good . Let's get back to the store.

1001
01:25:01,451 --> 01:25:02,884
- No way.
- No!

1002
01:25:02,953 --> 01:25:05,854
We wanna go to the fashion show
and squeeze us some juice.

1003
01:25:05,922 --> 01:25:07,981
We're tired of being losers.

1004
01:25:08,058 --> 01:25:09,958
It his toe time.

1005
01:25:10,460 --> 01:25:13,725
Well , on the one hand , Juice
is dangerous.

1006
01:25:15,031 --> 01:25:18,990
But on the other hand , seems
too pitty to quit while we're on a roll.

1007
01:25:32,816 --> 01:25:35,876
"Wow , what good would they look....

1008
01:25:37,554 --> 01:25:40,887
"Sandy in a sexy....

1009
01:25:40,957 --> 01:25:44,552
"antique black....

1010

"Rosy in a green evening dress...

01:25:48,565 --> 01:25:51,500
"guarantee the love of the audience"

1012
01:26:00,610 --> 01:26:03,977
As soon as you cross the border ,
get it to the warehouse.

1013
01:26:04,948 --> 01:26:06,279
Yo , captain.

1014
01:26:06,516 --> 01:26:08,711
Remember this is our fight.

1015
01:26:09,686 --> 01:26:10,914
Yeah.

1016
01:26:27,103 --> 01:26:28,161
Careful.

1017
01:26:46,389 --> 01:26:49,381
"And here we have another black skirt...

1018
01:26:49,459 --> 01:26:51,427
"with a zebra spots...

1019
01:26:56,232 --> 01:26:58,291
"a??....

1020
01:26:58,368 --> 01:27:01,565
"dress of lace....

1021
01:27:01,938 --> 01:27:04,304
"wow , what a gift....

1022
01:27:07,210 --> 01:27:10,043
Please bear with me , there's
been a slight mistake.

1023
01:27:10,347 --> 01:27:12,542
Would someone will straighten
this up please?

1024
01:27:13,650 --> 01:27:14,912
"Here we have..."

1025
01:27:14,985 --> 01:27:16,282
Where are we?

1026
01:27:16,386 --> 01:27:18,581
"With a blue bag and...."

1027
01:27:18,755 --> 01:27:20,222

Gimme that!

1029
01:28:01,564 --> 01:28:04,226
You're ruining my fashion show.
Do you understand that?

1030
01:28:04,300 --> 01:28:06,359
Get away from my clothes!

1031
01:28:06,436 --> 01:28:09,234
They're our clothes! They're ours!

1032
01:28:14,511 --> 01:28:15,671
Help!

1033
01:28:16,880 --> 01:28:18,438
Gimme that!

1034
01:28:26,089 --> 01:28:28,148
Those creatures were sure ugly!

1035
01:28:28,825 --> 01:28:31,293
Oh yeah? I'll show you ugly!

1036
01:28:50,080 --> 01:28:51,570
Let's get outta here.

1037
01:28:55,618 --> 01:28:57,449
Get her!

1038
01:29:01,224 --> 01:29:03,658
Go ahead! Make my day!

1039
01:29:05,328 --> 01:29:07,922
- Oh!
- Take it out!

1040
01:29:37,961 --> 01:29:38,950
Let's go.

1041
01:29:39,295 --> 01:29:40,626
Get him.

1042
01:29:45,101 --> 01:29:47,035
Come on!

1043
01:29:57,714 --> 01:29:59,375
Get it , tough guy.

1044
01:29:59,849 --> 01:30:02,079
Come on , let's get out of here.

1045
01:30:04,387 --> 01:30:06,548
Come on Dodger.

1046
01:30:09,792 --> 01:30:11,054
Got away!

1047
01:30:31,981 --> 01:30:34,347
He's not worth it!

1048
01:30:58,508 --> 01:30:59,600
I'm sorry.

1049
01:31:00,176 --> 01:31:01,336
Me too.

1050
01:31:03,446 --> 01:31:07,280
Look , the fashion was a big success.

1051
01:31:08,084 --> 01:31:09,881
I mean , you're a hit.

1052
01:31:11,454 --> 01:31:12,682
And this clothes...

1053
01:31:14,123 --> 01:31:15,488
They're not mine.

1054
01:31:16,326 --> 01:31:17,452
They are now.

1055
01:31:18,828 --> 01:31:21,456
Look , maybe we can just be friends.

1056
01:31:21,531 --> 01:31:24,056
Maybe we can do fun things together.

1057
01:31:25,101 --> 01:31:26,432
No thanks.

1058
01:31:29,205 --> 01:31:31,105
I don't think you're pretty anymore.

1059
01:31:51,361 --> 01:31:55,263
And then I realized I had the
answer all along.

1060
01:31:55,698 --> 01:31:59,566
Now I know you hate the thought
of going back into the can...

1061
01:32:00,036 --> 01:32:02,504
But believe me , it's for your
own good.

1062
01:32:02,872 --> 01:32:05,397
Dodger, bring that garbage can closer.

1063
01:32:06,442 --> 01:32:10,503
Now children , I want
you to close your eyes and concentrate.

1064
01:32:11,547 --> 01:32:14,675
Now this is your song played forth...

1065
01:32:16,586 --> 01:32:19,783
However , when I play the song backwards...

1066
01:32:19,856 --> 01:32:23,917
You will be drawn irresistibly
back into the garbage can.

1067
01:32:24,160 --> 01:32:25,787
- Yeah...
- Are you ready?

1068
01:32:26,562 --> 01:32:28,553
Close your eyes and concentrate.

1069
01:32:30,800 --> 01:32:32,392
That's our chance...

1070
01:32:32,468 --> 01:32:33,594
Let's go!

1071
01:32:36,039 --> 01:32:38,507
- Let's go.
- Come on , Valerie.

1072
01:32:40,109 --> 01:32:43,840
Dodger, this is no time to argue...
I shall miss them too.

1073
01:32:44,113 --> 01:32:46,547
Think how peaceful it would be.

1074
01:32:47,650 --> 01:32:49,083
We're nearly there.

1075
01:32:49,919 --> 01:32:51,511
Yes , I can feel it working.

1076
01:32:52,155 --> 01:32:56,455
- Here we go!
- Bye , children.

1077
01:33:08,504 --> 01:33:10,335
Hang on captain , I got you.

1078
01:33:11,607 --> 01:33:15,475
Don't worry, Dodger.
I've been stuck in tighter places than this.

1079
01:33:17,547 --> 01:33:19,913
Damn it! I lost them!

1080
01:33:20,249 --> 01:33:23,980
Losing is relative. What's important
is conceding with grace.

1081
01:33:32,261 --> 01:33:33,523
Go Windy!

1082
01:33:33,596 --> 01:33:35,359
...???

1083
01:33:40,603 --> 01:33:44,664
Well , perhaps it would be safer to lock
them away from the world...

1084
01:33:44,741 --> 01:33:46,504
But as you taught me , Dodger...

1085
01:33:46,576 --> 01:33:50,034
You can't change the world by
locking yourself from it.

1086
01:33:50,747 --> 01:33:52,544
Bye!

1087
01:33:57,920 --> 01:34:00,787
Away we go!

1088
01:34:06,429 --> 01:34:09,296
