1
00:02:15,674 --> 00:02:17,338
By edict of the Inquisition...

2
00:02:17,402 --> 00:02:20,442
to spread subversive thought
is heresy.

3
00:02:29,850 --> 00:02:31,450
By edict of the Inquisition...

4
00:02:31,514 --> 00:02:34,042
offenders will submit
to purification...

5
00:02:34,106 --> 00:02:36,442
by sword or flame.

6
00:02:41,243 --> 00:02:44,347
By edict of the Holy Office
of the Inquisition...

7
00:02:44,411 --> 00:02:46,299
to read or interpret
the Bible...

8
00:02:46,363 --> 00:02:48,891
is a sole province
of the Church.

9
00:03:18,395 --> 00:03:21,275
You must by no means
prevail with yourself...

10
00:03:21,339 --> 00:03:23,291
that these giants
you speak of...

11
00:03:23,355 --> 00:03:25,851
were ever real men
of this world...

12
00:03:25,915 --> 00:03:29,371
and true substantial
flesh and blood.

13
00:03:29,435 --> 00:03:32,091
Confess!
What you say of all of them...

14
00:03:32,155 --> 00:03:35,355
is fable and fiction,
lies and dreams.

15
00:03:35,419 --> 00:03:36,763
The Holy Bible...

16
00:03:36,827 --> 00:03:40,699
which cannot deviate
an atom from the truth...

17
00:03:40,763 --> 00:03:45,627
tells us of
that huge Philistine Goliath...

18
00:03:45,691 --> 00:03:48,667
who was fourteen and a half
feet high...

19
00:03:48,731 --> 00:03:51,547
which is an prodigious stature.

20
00:03:51,611 --> 00:03:53,915
You blaspheme
by quoting the Holy Bible...

21
00:03:53,979 --> 00:03:55,355
for your purposes.

22
00:03:57,083 --> 00:03:59,259
The interpretation
of holy writ...

23
00:03:59,323 --> 00:04:02,011
is the sacred function
of the Friars.

24
00:04:02,075 --> 00:04:03,995
We cannot all be Friars.

25
00:04:04,059 --> 00:04:06,811
And there are many ways
God leads his children home.

26
00:04:06,875 --> 00:04:10,427
Religion is knight-errantry.

27
00:04:10,491 --> 00:04:11,675
Miguel de Cervantes.

28
00:04:11,739 --> 00:04:15,099
Truth is only revealed...

29
00:04:15,163 --> 00:04:17,339
or dreamt.

30
00:04:27,900 --> 00:04:29,660
Miguel de Cervantes...

31
00:04:29,724 --> 00:04:33,532
in the name of the Holy Office
of the Inquisition...

32
00:04:33,596 --> 00:04:35,292
you are under arrest.

33
00:08:58,782 --> 00:09:01,758
Anything wrong
with the accommodations?

34
00:09:01,822 --> 00:09:02,974
Oh, no, no, no.

35
00:09:03,038 --> 00:09:06,078
They're quite... interesting.

36
00:09:06,142 --> 00:09:08,286
This is what
we've come to regard...

37
00:09:08,350 --> 00:09:10,206
as the common room.

38
00:09:10,270 --> 00:09:12,894
For those who wait.

39
00:09:12,958 --> 00:09:15,102
Do they wait long?

40
00:09:15,166 --> 00:09:17,246
An hour...

41
00:09:17,310 --> 00:09:19,454
a lifetime.

42
00:09:19,518 --> 00:09:21,054
Who knows?

43
00:09:21,118 --> 00:09:24,446
Do they all await
the Inquisitions?

44
00:09:24,510 --> 00:09:27,967
Ah, no, señor.
Not all of them.

45
00:09:28,031 --> 00:09:29,215
Most of these...

46
00:09:29,279 --> 00:09:31,455
are merely
thieves and murderers.

47
00:09:31,519 --> 00:09:32,511
Oh.

48
00:09:32,575 --> 00:09:34,943
If you want anything,
just shout.

49
00:09:36,287 --> 00:09:37,471
If you are able.

50
00:09:39,615 --> 00:09:41,151
What did he mean by that?

51
00:09:41,215 --> 00:09:42,815
He meant to frighten us.

52
00:09:45,375 --> 00:09:47,807
I think they intend us to stay.

53
00:09:47,871 --> 00:09:49,343
You think? God!

54
00:09:49,407 --> 00:09:50,367
Calm yourself.

55
00:09:50,431 --> 00:09:52,607
There's a remedy
for everything but death.

56
00:09:52,671 --> 00:09:54,751
That may be
just the remedy we need.

57
00:09:54,815 --> 00:09:59,551
Good day, gentlemen, ladies.

58
00:09:59,615 --> 00:10:02,655
I regret being thrust upon you
in this manner.

59
00:10:02,719 --> 00:10:06,271
I hope you'll not find
our company objectionable.

60
00:10:06,335 --> 00:10:10,239
I'm no stranger
to similar surroundings.

61
00:10:10,303 --> 00:10:13,055
I've been in prison
more than once.

62
00:10:13,119 --> 00:10:14,239
- Many times.
- Many times.

63
00:10:14,303 --> 00:10:20,639
And often I have thought
the world to be a prison...

64
00:10:20,703 --> 00:10:23,295
a very cruel one...

65
00:10:23,359 --> 00:10:25,471
where all have desires...

66
00:10:25,535 --> 00:10:28,095
few of which are fulfilled.

67
00:10:29,375 --> 00:10:31,679
But how thoughtless of me to...

68
00:11:03,199 --> 00:11:07,135
Enough! Enough!

69
00:11:07,199 --> 00:11:11,328
Noise, trouble, fights.

70
00:11:11,392 --> 00:11:12,704
Kill each other if you must...

71
00:11:12,768 --> 00:11:16,064
but for God's sake,
do it quietly.

72
00:11:17,056 --> 00:11:17,952
Who are you?

73
00:11:18,016 --> 00:11:20,384
Huh? Speak up!

74
00:11:27,488 --> 00:11:29,152
Cervantes.

75
00:11:29,216 --> 00:11:31,680
Don Miguel de Cervantes.

76
00:11:31,744 --> 00:11:34,400
Oh, a gentleman!

77
00:11:37,696 --> 00:11:40,160
Doesn't prevent me
from going to bed hungry.

78
00:11:40,224 --> 00:11:41,920
And that?

79
00:11:43,552 --> 00:11:45,856
My assistant.

80
00:11:45,920 --> 00:11:47,264
May I have the honor?

81
00:11:48,672 --> 00:11:51,968
They call me the Governor.

82
00:11:52,032 --> 00:11:53,536
- What's your game?
- Game?

83
00:11:53,600 --> 00:11:56,480
Your speciality, man.

84
00:11:56,544 --> 00:11:58,752
Cutpurse? Highwayman?

85
00:11:58,816 --> 00:12:01,280
Nothing so rewarding.
I'm a poet.

86
00:12:02,304 --> 00:12:04,416
They're putting people
in prison for that?

87
00:12:04,480 --> 00:12:07,744
No, no, no, not for that.

88
00:12:07,808 --> 00:12:09,408
Too bad.

89
00:12:12,704 --> 00:12:13,920
Might I meet this gentleman?

90
00:12:13,984 --> 00:12:15,872
Your name, sir?

91
00:12:15,936 --> 00:12:17,888
Names have no meaning here.
I'm called the Duke.

92
00:12:17,952 --> 00:12:20,160
And your speciality?

93
00:12:20,224 --> 00:12:21,344
Treason.

94
00:12:21,408 --> 00:12:23,648
I invent false information
about a country...

95
00:12:23,712 --> 00:12:26,016
and sell it to others
stupid enough to believe it.

96
00:12:26,080 --> 00:12:28,896
Seems a sound proposition.
What brought you here?

97
00:12:28,960 --> 00:12:31,136
A lapse of judgment.
I told the truth.

98
00:12:32,224 --> 00:12:34,400
- Did you like your job?
- Quite.

99
00:12:34,464 --> 00:12:35,616
Do you like yourself?

100
00:12:35,680 --> 00:12:39,040
I believe I could learn
to dislike you.

101
00:12:39,104 --> 00:12:42,528
Well, now,
let's get on with the trial.

102
00:12:44,128 --> 00:12:45,472
Trial? What trial?

103
00:12:45,536 --> 00:12:47,200
Yours, of course.

104
00:12:47,264 --> 00:12:48,928
And what have I done?

105
00:12:48,992 --> 00:12:51,200
We'll soon find something.

106
00:12:51,264 --> 00:12:52,417
But we don't understand.

107
00:12:52,481 --> 00:12:54,305
We've only been here
a few hours.

108
00:12:54,369 --> 00:12:56,929
My dear sir, no one enters
or leaves this prison...

109
00:12:56,993 --> 00:12:59,457
without being tried
by his fellow prisoners.

110
00:12:59,521 --> 00:13:00,865
And if I'm found guilty?

111
00:13:00,929 --> 00:13:02,913
- You will be.
- The sentence?

112
00:13:02,977 --> 00:13:05,377
We generally fine a prisoner
all his possessions.

113
00:13:05,441 --> 00:13:06,657
All of them?

114
00:13:06,721 --> 00:13:08,097
It's not practical to take more.

115
00:13:08,161 --> 00:13:10,657
But these things
are my livelihood.

116
00:13:10,721 --> 00:13:12,449
I thought you said
you were a poet.

117
00:13:12,513 --> 00:13:13,729
Of the theater.

118
00:13:13,793 --> 00:13:15,265
Of the theater.

119
00:13:15,329 --> 00:13:16,417
- You see?
- What?

120
00:13:16,481 --> 00:13:17,633
Come here. Come here.

121
00:13:17,697 --> 00:13:20,001
Oh!

122
00:13:20,065 --> 00:13:21,793
False.

123
00:13:21,857 --> 00:13:24,129
Properties and costumes.

124
00:13:24,193 --> 00:13:27,649
You see, I'm a playwright
and an actor.

125
00:13:27,713 --> 00:13:29,057
So these poor things...

126
00:13:29,121 --> 00:13:31,105
couldn't possibly be
of any use to you.

127
00:13:32,417 --> 00:13:33,345
Oh, no, wait!

128
00:13:33,409 --> 00:13:34,785
You'll break it!

129
00:13:34,849 --> 00:13:36,897
Take them! Take them!

130
00:13:36,961 --> 00:13:38,657
Oh, no, Don Miguel!

131
00:13:38,721 --> 00:13:40,673
No. Take them, I say.

132
00:13:42,305 --> 00:13:44,257
Only leave me this.

133
00:13:45,697 --> 00:13:47,777
Heavy. Valuable?

134
00:13:47,841 --> 00:13:49,729
Only to me.

135
00:13:49,793 --> 00:13:51,937
I'll let you ransom it.

136
00:13:52,001 --> 00:13:53,377
I have no money.

137
00:13:53,441 --> 00:13:55,969
How unfortunate.

138
00:13:56,033 --> 00:13:57,217
Paper!

139
00:13:57,281 --> 00:13:58,241
Manuscript.

140
00:13:58,305 --> 00:14:00,225
Still worthless!

141
00:14:01,217 --> 00:14:03,617
No! Wait!

142
00:14:04,673 --> 00:14:05,953
You said a trial!

143
00:14:06,017 --> 00:14:10,401
By your own words,
I demand a trial!

144
00:14:10,465 --> 00:14:13,633
Oh, very well, then.

145
00:14:13,697 --> 00:14:18,657
I hereby declare this court
to be in session.

146
00:14:25,697 --> 00:14:29,473
Now, then,
what are you here for?

147
00:14:30,593 --> 00:14:32,609
We are to appear
before the Inquisition.

148
00:14:34,754 --> 00:14:36,098
Heresy?

149
00:14:36,162 --> 00:14:37,762
No, not exactly.

150
00:14:37,826 --> 00:14:41,250
You see, we were presenting
an entertainment.

151
00:14:41,314 --> 00:14:42,946
An entertainment?

152
00:14:43,010 --> 00:14:45,090
How does an entertainment
get into trouble...

153
00:14:45,154 --> 00:14:46,178
with the Inquisition?

154
00:14:46,242 --> 00:14:48,418
Perhaps they found
an entertainment...

155
00:14:48,482 --> 00:14:49,698
is not always what it seems.

156
00:14:49,762 --> 00:14:51,298
Why are you here?

157
00:14:51,362 --> 00:14:53,730
Somebody has
to stage-manage the stage.

158
00:14:54,978 --> 00:14:57,698
These two have empty holes
in their heads.

159
00:14:58,722 --> 00:14:59,746
Governor, if you don't mind...

160
00:14:59,810 --> 00:15:01,442
I should like
to prosecute this case.

161
00:15:01,506 --> 00:15:02,786
You, sir? Why, sir?

162
00:15:02,850 --> 00:15:03,906
Poets...

163
00:15:03,970 --> 00:15:05,762
spinning nonsense
out of nothing.

164
00:15:05,826 --> 00:15:07,394
Blurring men's eyes to reality.

165
00:15:07,458 --> 00:15:09,314
Exactly!

166
00:15:09,378 --> 00:15:10,946
Reality!

167
00:15:13,634 --> 00:15:17,506
A stone prison crushing
the human spirit.

168
00:15:17,570 --> 00:15:19,650
Poetry demands imagination.

169
00:15:19,714 --> 00:15:23,266
And with imagination,
you may discover a dream.

170
00:15:23,330 --> 00:15:25,890
The trial! On with the trial!

171
00:15:25,954 --> 00:15:27,810
Miguel de Cervantes,
I charge you...

172
00:15:27,874 --> 00:15:31,074
with being an idealist,
a bad poet...

173
00:15:31,138 --> 00:15:32,642
and an honest man.
How plead you?

174
00:15:32,706 --> 00:15:33,826
Guilty.

175
00:15:33,890 --> 00:15:35,394
Bravo!

176
00:15:35,458 --> 00:15:36,578
Your Excellency...

177
00:15:36,642 --> 00:15:38,786
ladies and gentlemen,
my defense.

178
00:15:38,850 --> 00:15:40,482
But you just pleaded guilty.

179
00:15:40,546 --> 00:15:41,762
Had I said innocent,

180
00:15:41,826 --> 00:15:44,546
you would surely
have found me guilty.

181
00:15:44,610 --> 00:15:46,722
Since I've admitted guilt...

182
00:15:46,786 --> 00:15:49,186
the court is obliged
to hear me out.

183
00:15:49,250 --> 00:15:51,298
For what purpose?

184
00:15:51,362 --> 00:15:54,786
The jury may
choose to be lenient.

185
00:15:56,994 --> 00:15:58,466
Clever!

186
00:15:58,530 --> 00:16:00,130
He's trying to gain time.

187
00:16:00,194 --> 00:16:02,850
Do you have a scarcity of time?

188
00:16:02,914 --> 00:16:06,338
Any urgent appointments?

189
00:16:12,674 --> 00:16:16,579
It is true I am guilty
of these charges.

190
00:16:17,571 --> 00:16:19,235
An idealist!

191
00:16:20,931 --> 00:16:25,059
I've never had the courage
to believe in nothing.

192
00:16:25,123 --> 00:16:26,787
A bad poet?

193
00:16:28,451 --> 00:16:30,147
This comes from a painful ear.

194
00:16:30,211 --> 00:16:32,611
Have you finished your defense?

195
00:16:32,675 --> 00:16:35,427
No, no, scarcely begun.

196
00:16:35,491 --> 00:16:37,571
With your permission,
I will continue...

197
00:16:37,635 --> 00:16:39,331
in the manner I know best.

198
00:16:39,395 --> 00:16:40,675
In the form of a charade.

199
00:16:40,739 --> 00:16:41,699
Charade?

200
00:16:41,763 --> 00:16:43,779
An entertainment, if you will.

201
00:16:43,843 --> 00:16:45,699
An entertainment?

202
00:16:45,763 --> 00:16:48,803
At worst,
it may beguile the time.

203
00:16:48,867 --> 00:16:52,067
And since my cast
of characters is large...

204
00:16:52,131 --> 00:16:54,339
I call upon you all
to enter in...

205
00:16:54,403 --> 00:16:57,795
and play whatever role
may suit your fancy.

206
00:16:57,859 --> 00:16:59,075
Governor,
I shall like to protest.

207
00:16:59,139 --> 00:17:00,611
No!

208
00:17:03,779 --> 00:17:06,371
Let's hear him out.

209
00:17:06,435 --> 00:17:08,035
If you've no objection...

210
00:17:08,099 --> 00:17:09,923
and with
your kind permission...

211
00:17:09,987 --> 00:17:11,331
may I set the stage?

212
00:17:11,395 --> 00:17:12,771
Proceed!

213
00:17:16,291 --> 00:17:19,171
I will impersonate a man.

214
00:17:19,235 --> 00:17:23,011
His name... Alonso Quijana.

215
00:17:23,075 --> 00:17:25,571
A country gentleman,
no longer young.

216
00:17:25,635 --> 00:17:28,451
Being retired,
he has much time for books.

217
00:17:28,515 --> 00:17:30,147
He studies them
from morn till night...

218
00:17:30,211 --> 00:17:32,835
and often through the night
till morn again.

219
00:17:32,899 --> 00:17:34,787
And all he reads
oppresses him...

220
00:17:34,851 --> 00:17:35,907
fills him with indignation...

221
00:17:35,971 --> 00:17:38,339
at man's murderous ways
towards man.

222
00:17:38,403 --> 00:17:41,475
He ponders the problem...
how to make better a world...

223
00:17:41,539 --> 00:17:45,731
where evil brings profit
and virtue none at all.

224
00:17:45,795 --> 00:17:47,939
Where fraud,
deceit, and malice...

225
00:17:48,003 --> 00:17:50,499
are mingled
with truth and sincerity.

226
00:17:50,563 --> 00:17:53,635
He broods and broods
and broods and broods...

227
00:17:53,699 --> 00:17:58,692
and broods and finally
his brains dry up.

228
00:17:58,756 --> 00:18:03,172
He lays down the melancholy
burden of sanity...

229
00:18:03,236 --> 00:18:06,788
and conceives the strangest
project ever imagined...

230
00:18:06,852 --> 00:18:10,788
to become a knight-errant,
and sally forth...

231
00:18:10,852 --> 00:18:13,572
to roam the world
in search of adventures...

232
00:18:13,636 --> 00:18:16,580
to right all wrongs,
to mount a crusade...

233
00:18:16,644 --> 00:18:19,396
to raise up the weak
and those in need.

234
00:18:19,460 --> 00:18:22,820
He persuades his neighbor,
one Sancho Panza...

235
00:18:22,884 --> 00:18:24,964
a country laborer
and an honest man...

236
00:18:25,028 --> 00:18:26,756
if the poorer
may be called honest...

237
00:18:26,820 --> 00:18:29,860
and he was poor, indeed,
to become his squire.

238
00:18:29,924 --> 00:18:33,732
He selects an ancient
cart horse called Rosinante...

239
00:18:33,796 --> 00:18:35,108
to become his steed...

240
00:18:35,172 --> 00:18:37,476
and the safeguard
of his master's will.

241
00:18:37,540 --> 00:18:40,740
These preparations made,
he seizes his lance.

242
00:18:40,804 --> 00:18:43,364
No longer will he be
plain Alonso Quijana...

243
00:18:43,428 --> 00:18:44,804
but a dauntless knight...

244
00:18:44,868 --> 00:18:48,868
known as
Don Quixote de La Mancha!

245
00:18:51,844 --> 00:18:52,964
Hear me now

246
00:18:53,028 --> 00:18:56,420
Oh, thou bleak
and unbearable world

247
00:18:56,484 --> 00:19:01,028
Thou art base
and debauched as can be

248
00:19:01,092 --> 00:19:05,700
And the knight with his banners
all bravely unfurled

249
00:19:05,764 --> 00:19:09,988
Now hurls down
his gauntlet to thee

250
00:19:10,052 --> 00:19:12,708
I am I, Don Quixote

251
00:19:12,772 --> 00:19:15,044
The Lord of La Mancha

252
00:19:15,108 --> 00:19:19,716
My destiny calls and I go

253
00:19:19,780 --> 00:19:22,244
And the wild winds of fortune

254
00:19:22,308 --> 00:19:24,996
Will carry me onward

255
00:19:25,060 --> 00:19:29,668
Whithersoever they blow

256
00:19:29,732 --> 00:19:34,372
Whithersoever they blow

257
00:19:34,436 --> 00:19:39,044
Onward to glory I go

258
00:19:39,108 --> 00:19:41,413
I'm Sancho

259
00:19:41,477 --> 00:19:43,749
Yes, I'm Sancho

260
00:19:43,813 --> 00:19:48,549
I'll follow my master
till the end

261
00:19:48,613 --> 00:19:53,445
I'll tell all the world proudly

262
00:19:53,509 --> 00:19:56,165
I'm his squire

263
00:19:56,229 --> 00:19:58,213
I'm his friend

264
00:20:01,509 --> 00:20:03,717
Hear me,
heathens and wizards

265
00:20:03,781 --> 00:20:06,053
And serpents of sin

266
00:20:06,117 --> 00:20:10,693
All your dastardly doings
are past

267
00:20:10,757 --> 00:20:15,397
For a holy endeavor
is now to begin

268
00:20:15,461 --> 00:20:19,813
And virtue shall triumph at last

269
00:20:50,117 --> 00:20:53,349
- I am I, Don Quixote
- I am Sancho

270
00:20:53,413 --> 00:20:55,717
- The Lord of La Mancha
- Yes, I am Sancho

271
00:20:55,781 --> 00:21:00,293
- My destiny calls and I go
- Follow my master till the end

272
00:21:00,357 --> 00:21:03,429
- And the wild winds of fortune
- I'll tell all the world

273
00:21:03,493 --> 00:21:06,661
- Will carry me onward
- Proudly I'm his squire

274
00:21:06,725 --> 00:21:10,437
- Whithersoever they blow
- I'm his friend

275
00:21:10,501 --> 00:21:15,205
Whithersoever they blow

276
00:21:15,269 --> 00:21:22,725
Onward to glory I go

277
00:21:22,789 --> 00:21:26,150
Well, Sancho,
likest thou adventuring?

278
00:21:26,214 --> 00:21:28,934
It's marvelous, Your Grace,
but it is peculiar.

279
00:21:28,998 --> 00:21:30,790
This great road to glory...

280
00:21:30,854 --> 00:21:32,870
Iooks exactly like
the road to El Diboso...

281
00:21:32,934 --> 00:21:34,662
where you can buy
chickens cheap.

282
00:21:34,726 --> 00:21:38,022
'Tis a sign thou art little
acquainted with adventuring.

283
00:21:38,086 --> 00:21:41,030
Only wait, and thou shalt see
amazing sights.

284
00:21:41,094 --> 00:21:42,054
Like what?

285
00:21:42,118 --> 00:21:44,422
There will be
knights and nations...

286
00:21:44,486 --> 00:21:46,118
warlocks and wizards.

287
00:21:46,182 --> 00:21:48,966
A cavalcade
of vast, unending armies.

288
00:21:49,030 --> 00:21:49,990
They sound dangerous.

289
00:21:50,054 --> 00:21:51,398
They are dangerous.

290
00:21:51,462 --> 00:21:54,886
But one there will be
the most dangerous of all.

291
00:21:54,950 --> 00:21:56,742
- Who?
- The Great Enchanter.

292
00:21:56,806 --> 00:22:00,134
- The Great Enchanter?
- Yes. Beware him, Sancho.

293
00:22:00,198 --> 00:22:02,598
His thoughts are cold,
his soul shriveled...

294
00:22:02,662 --> 00:22:04,678
his eyes
are little machines...

295
00:22:04,742 --> 00:22:07,174
and where he walks,
the earth is blighted.

296
00:22:07,238 --> 00:22:10,118
One day, I will meet him
face to face.

297
00:22:10,182 --> 00:22:12,550
Well, I wouldn't get upset,
Your Grace.

298
00:22:12,614 --> 00:22:13,830
As I always say...

299
00:22:13,894 --> 00:22:15,590
have patience
and shuffle the cards.

300
00:22:15,654 --> 00:22:16,838
- Proverb?
- Yes, Your Grace.

301
00:22:16,902 --> 00:22:19,558
Proverb piled on proverb,
you never cease.

302
00:22:19,622 --> 00:22:21,702
No, Your Grace,
I've got a belly full of them.

303
00:22:21,766 --> 00:22:24,166
- As I always say...
- Sweet Jesu!

304
00:22:27,238 --> 00:22:28,710
- Do you see him?
- Who?

305
00:22:28,774 --> 00:22:30,054
The Great Enchanter!

306
00:22:30,118 --> 00:22:32,678
- Dost thou not see?
- What?

307
00:22:32,742 --> 00:22:37,606
The monstrous giant
of infamous repute!

308
00:22:37,670 --> 00:22:39,654
Whom I intend to encounter.

309
00:22:39,718 --> 00:22:41,510
- It's a windmill.
- A giant.

310
00:22:41,574 --> 00:22:43,398
A windmill.

311
00:22:43,462 --> 00:22:45,062
A giant!
Canst thou not see...

312
00:22:45,126 --> 00:22:47,238
the four great arms
a-whirling at his back?

313
00:22:47,302 --> 00:22:49,094
A giant?

314
00:22:49,158 --> 00:22:51,878
Exactly.
How long since we sallied forth?

315
00:22:51,942 --> 00:22:53,030
About two minutes.

316
00:22:53,094 --> 00:22:56,806
So soon will I engage
in brave, unequaled combat.

317
00:22:56,870 --> 00:22:58,790
Hold there, foul monster!

318
00:22:58,854 --> 00:23:00,998
Cease the knocking
of thy craven knees...

319
00:23:01,062 --> 00:23:02,694
and prepare to do battle!

320
00:23:02,758 --> 00:23:04,166
I swear, Your Grace...

321
00:23:04,230 --> 00:23:06,279
by my wife's
little black mustache...

322
00:23:06,343 --> 00:23:08,231
- that is not...
- Charge!

323
00:23:08,295 --> 00:23:10,279
Your Grace, wait!

324
00:23:40,327 --> 00:23:41,831
Surrender!

325
00:23:43,463 --> 00:23:46,343
Vile coward!

326
00:23:46,407 --> 00:23:48,103
Surrender!

327
00:23:48,167 --> 00:23:49,991
Surrender! Have at you!

328
00:23:50,055 --> 00:23:52,135
Surrender, coward!

329
00:23:52,199 --> 00:23:54,823
Vile creature,
do not seek to bleat!

330
00:23:54,887 --> 00:23:56,935
Hold on!

331
00:23:57,959 --> 00:23:59,495
Hold on, Master!

332
00:23:59,559 --> 00:24:01,863
Yield!
I'll show thee no mercy!

333
00:24:01,927 --> 00:24:04,775
- Vile creature!
- Hold on!

334
00:24:04,839 --> 00:24:07,239
Surrender, I tell thee!

335
00:24:07,303 --> 00:24:10,311
Fall to thy knees and beg mercy!

336
00:24:10,375 --> 00:24:14,279
Or I'll rob thee
of thy very life!

337
00:24:14,343 --> 00:24:15,655
Thou art vanquished!

338
00:24:15,719 --> 00:24:18,183
Vanquished!

339
00:24:18,247 --> 00:24:20,455
Vanquished!

340
00:24:20,519 --> 00:24:22,695
- Hold on, Master!
- Surrender!

341
00:24:22,759 --> 00:24:23,399
Have at you!

342
00:24:23,463 --> 00:24:26,791
Surrender, vile creature!

343
00:24:26,855 --> 00:24:28,487
Surrender!

344
00:24:31,623 --> 00:24:33,255
Your Grace!

345
00:24:33,319 --> 00:24:35,303
Your Grace!

346
00:24:37,479 --> 00:24:39,111
Master!

347
00:24:39,175 --> 00:24:40,871
Didn't I tell you?

348
00:24:40,935 --> 00:24:44,071
Didn't I say,
"Your Grace, it's a windmill"?

349
00:24:44,135 --> 00:24:46,119
The work of mine enemy!

350
00:24:46,183 --> 00:24:47,463
The Enchanter?

351
00:24:47,527 --> 00:24:51,816
He transformed the giant
into a windmill...

352
00:24:51,880 --> 00:24:55,080
to prevent me
the honor of victory.

353
00:24:55,144 --> 00:24:57,032
You'd be wise to avoid him,
Your Grace.

354
00:24:57,096 --> 00:24:59,304
One of these days,
he'll get you killed.

355
00:24:59,368 --> 00:25:02,536
Hell has not seen
nor Heaven created...

356
00:25:02,600 --> 00:25:05,832
the one who can prevail
against me.

357
00:25:05,896 --> 00:25:07,560
He's doing very well.

358
00:25:07,624 --> 00:25:09,960
Come, Your Grace.

359
00:25:10,024 --> 00:25:12,520
We'll find a place
to get you repaired.

360
00:25:12,584 --> 00:25:15,144
A knight must not
complain of his wounds...

361
00:25:15,208 --> 00:25:17,768
though his bowels
be dropping out.

362
00:25:17,832 --> 00:25:21,896
But we could find the hall
of some great lord.

363
00:25:21,960 --> 00:25:23,784
Listen!

364
00:25:23,848 --> 00:25:25,288
What?

365
00:25:25,352 --> 00:25:28,872
A trumpet heralding my approach.

366
00:25:28,936 --> 00:25:31,656
There! The very place.

367
00:25:31,720 --> 00:25:33,160
- Where?
- The castle.

368
00:25:33,224 --> 00:25:35,976
- Castle?
- Rockbound amidst the mountains.

369
00:25:36,040 --> 00:25:37,512
- Mountains?
- And the banners.

370
00:25:37,576 --> 00:25:40,520
The brave banners
flaunting the wind.

371
00:25:41,960 --> 00:25:43,368
Blow thy bugle...

372
00:25:43,432 --> 00:25:45,672
that a dwarf may
mount the battlements...

373
00:25:45,736 --> 00:25:48,104
and announce our presence.

374
00:25:51,144 --> 00:25:52,584
But I don't see a castle.

375
00:25:52,648 --> 00:25:53,640
What?

376
00:25:53,704 --> 00:25:55,240
- I do see something.
- What?

377
00:25:55,304 --> 00:25:57,352
- It looks like an inn.
- An inn?

378
00:25:57,416 --> 00:25:59,592
An inn. We will repair...

379
00:25:59,656 --> 00:26:01,448
to the drawbridge
of yonder castle...

380
00:26:01,512 --> 00:26:02,184
and there thy vision
may improve it.

381
00:26:02,184 --> 00:26:03,656
And there thy vision
may improve it.

382
00:26:08,328 --> 00:26:09,448
Reality.

383
00:26:10,568 --> 00:26:11,688
To Sancho, an inn.

384
00:26:11,752 --> 00:26:13,416
To Don Quixote, a castle.

385
00:26:13,480 --> 00:26:15,848
To someone else, whatever.

386
00:26:15,912 --> 00:26:20,008
But for sweet argument's sake,
let us grant Sancho his version.

387
00:26:20,072 --> 00:26:21,416
- An inn.
- An inn!

388
00:26:21,480 --> 00:26:23,656
Governor, a kindly innkeeper.

389
00:26:23,720 --> 00:26:26,568
A brothel keeper, if you like.

390
00:26:26,632 --> 00:26:29,000
And his less kindly wife.

391
00:26:29,064 --> 00:26:31,177
That's right.
A marriage of minds.

392
00:26:31,241 --> 00:26:33,225
- God forbid!
- Mule drivers!

393
00:26:33,289 --> 00:26:37,129
Hard men! Miles and miles
on the road each day.

394
00:26:37,193 --> 00:26:40,585
And a man to lead the men.
Pedro.

395
00:26:40,649 --> 00:26:42,153
- Pedro?
- Pedro.

396
00:26:42,217 --> 00:26:44,201
And for the men...

397
00:26:44,265 --> 00:26:47,689
beautiful women
who please for profit.

398
00:26:49,385 --> 00:26:51,209
Fermina!

399
00:26:51,273 --> 00:26:54,313
And a most particular...

400
00:26:54,377 --> 00:26:57,065
kitchen maid...

401
00:26:57,129 --> 00:26:59,721
called Aldonza.

402
00:26:59,785 --> 00:27:02,761
One to whom life has been
discourteous.

403
00:27:02,825 --> 00:27:07,177
A tigress crouching in the dark.

404
00:27:07,241 --> 00:27:10,953
Still keen in tooth and claw.

405
00:27:12,265 --> 00:27:15,017
- Take it, Aldonza.
- Aldonza!

406
00:27:15,081 --> 00:27:16,521
Come on, Aldonza, take it!

407
00:27:16,585 --> 00:27:18,249
- Aldonza!
- Take it!

408
00:27:26,889 --> 00:27:29,129
Aldonza!

409
00:27:35,881 --> 00:27:38,825
You want this on the table
or over your lousy heads?

410
00:27:40,649 --> 00:27:43,401
There, swine. Feed!

411
00:27:45,065 --> 00:27:46,121
I brought you something.

412
00:27:46,185 --> 00:27:47,945
Keep it till it grows up.

413
00:27:51,753 --> 00:27:53,705
Little dogs have big ideas.

414
00:27:55,049 --> 00:27:56,361
Tonight!

415
00:27:59,177 --> 00:28:00,713
Payment in advance.

416
00:28:02,537 --> 00:28:03,817
Aldonza!

417
00:28:03,881 --> 00:28:05,705
Talk with your money,
not your hands.

418
00:28:05,769 --> 00:28:09,289
How about a nice
thick bed of hay instead?

419
00:28:09,385 --> 00:28:11,113
Good. Eat it.

420
00:28:13,482 --> 00:28:16,298
You refuse Pedro?

421
00:28:16,362 --> 00:28:18,442
Try me. Try me.

422
00:28:18,506 --> 00:28:20,490
My mules are not so stubborn.

423
00:28:21,866 --> 00:28:24,202
Fine. Make love to your mules.

424
00:28:25,290 --> 00:28:27,402
Aldonza, I sell my mules.

425
00:28:27,466 --> 00:28:30,570
Aldonza, I am the best lover!

426
00:28:30,634 --> 00:28:33,802
Who cares? Just pay me!

427
00:28:34,666 --> 00:28:38,858
One pair of arms is like another

428
00:28:38,922 --> 00:28:42,954
I don't know why
or who's to blame

429
00:28:43,018 --> 00:28:47,242
I'll go with you
or with your brother

430
00:28:47,306 --> 00:28:49,962
It's all the same

431
00:28:50,026 --> 00:28:52,810
It's all the same

432
00:28:52,874 --> 00:28:56,970
This I have learned
that when the light's out

433
00:28:57,034 --> 00:29:00,938
No man will burn
with special flame

434
00:29:01,002 --> 00:29:04,650
You'll prove to me
before the night's out

435
00:29:04,714 --> 00:29:07,626
You're all the same

436
00:29:07,690 --> 00:29:09,258
You're all the same

437
00:29:09,322 --> 00:29:10,314
Not me, Aldonza!

438
00:29:10,378 --> 00:29:15,146
So do not talk to me of love

439
00:29:15,210 --> 00:29:18,090
I'm not a fool

440
00:29:18,154 --> 00:29:20,778
With starry eyes

441
00:29:20,842 --> 00:29:26,218
Just put your money in my hand

442
00:29:26,282 --> 00:29:31,626
And you will get what money buys

443
00:29:33,226 --> 00:29:37,450
When I am dead,
no man will miss me

444
00:29:37,514 --> 00:29:41,258
For life's
a cruel and dirty game

445
00:29:41,322 --> 00:29:45,450
So you can curse
or you can kiss me

446
00:29:45,514 --> 00:29:47,114
It's all the same

447
00:29:47,178 --> 00:29:48,266
More wine, Aldonza!

448
00:29:48,330 --> 00:29:50,922
It's all the same

449
00:30:04,075 --> 00:30:09,611
Oh, I have seen too many beds

450
00:30:09,675 --> 00:30:14,923
But I have known too little rest

451
00:30:14,987 --> 00:30:20,491
And I have loved too many men

452
00:30:20,555 --> 00:30:25,835
With hatred burning in my breast

453
00:30:25,899 --> 00:30:27,627
Aldonza!

454
00:30:27,691 --> 00:30:32,139
I do not like you
or your brother

455
00:30:32,203 --> 00:30:35,787
I do not like the life I live

456
00:30:35,851 --> 00:30:38,027
But I am me

457
00:30:38,091 --> 00:30:40,203
I am Aldonza

458
00:30:40,267 --> 00:30:43,723
And what I give, I choose...

459
00:30:43,787 --> 00:30:45,067
Choose!

460
00:31:09,963 --> 00:31:14,827
One pair of arms is like another

461
00:31:14,891 --> 00:31:17,643
It's all the same

462
00:31:17,707 --> 00:31:20,235
It's all the same

463
00:31:21,227 --> 00:31:22,347
Aldonza!

464
00:31:26,091 --> 00:31:28,587
Well, gentlemen,
everything in order?

465
00:31:28,651 --> 00:31:29,867
Did you feed the mules?

466
00:31:29,931 --> 00:31:32,587
- They're eating as well as you.
- Oh, no.

467
00:31:32,651 --> 00:31:34,731
God forbid.

468
00:31:34,795 --> 00:31:37,036
He jokes.

469
00:31:37,100 --> 00:31:39,692
It's well-known
that I set the finest table...

470
00:31:39,756 --> 00:31:41,292
between Madrid and Malaga.

471
00:31:42,284 --> 00:31:44,268
My patrons have always...

472
00:31:46,028 --> 00:31:49,996
It's the pig butcher.
I didn't expect him so early.

473
00:31:50,060 --> 00:31:51,116
What in the name of?

474
00:31:51,180 --> 00:31:54,796
Coming! Coming!
Señor butcher, coming!

475
00:32:03,756 --> 00:32:07,148
Is the lord of the castle
at hand?

476
00:32:08,428 --> 00:32:12,588
I say, is the Castellano here?

477
00:32:12,652 --> 00:32:15,468
I am in charge of this place.

478
00:32:15,532 --> 00:32:19,692
We waited, sire, for a dwarf
to mount the battlements...

479
00:32:19,756 --> 00:32:22,252
and announce us,
but none appeared.

480
00:32:22,316 --> 00:32:25,772
The, uh, the dwarfs,
they're all busy.

481
00:32:30,252 --> 00:32:33,324
My noble lords and ladies...

482
00:32:33,388 --> 00:32:36,044
my master Don Quixote...

483
00:32:37,324 --> 00:32:39,276
- Knight-errant?
- Knight-errant...

484
00:32:39,340 --> 00:32:43,372
defender of the right,
and pursuer of...

485
00:32:43,436 --> 00:32:46,988
of lofty undertakings
requests the...

486
00:32:48,204 --> 00:32:49,356
boon?

487
00:32:50,668 --> 00:32:53,676
The boon of hospitality!

488
00:32:56,204 --> 00:32:58,444
Well, sir, is it granted?

489
00:32:58,508 --> 00:33:00,204
Absolutely!

490
00:33:00,268 --> 00:33:05,452
You see? I mean, this castle
is open to everybody.

491
00:33:09,324 --> 00:33:10,764
Master!

492
00:33:13,356 --> 00:33:14,572
Master!

493
00:33:14,636 --> 00:33:17,100
Master! Master!

494
00:33:21,037 --> 00:33:22,957
Are you hurt?

495
00:33:23,021 --> 00:33:28,077
One of the little mishaps
of my profession.

496
00:33:28,141 --> 00:33:29,293
He's a madman.

497
00:33:29,357 --> 00:33:31,341
Madmen are the children of God.

498
00:33:31,405 --> 00:33:33,389
Sir Knight, you must be hungry.

499
00:33:33,453 --> 00:33:35,149
I am, sir.

500
00:33:35,213 --> 00:33:37,677
There is food aplenty.
And for your squire, too.

501
00:33:37,741 --> 00:33:42,029
Well, as I always say, hunger
is the best gravy in the world.

502
00:33:42,093 --> 00:33:44,141
And as the poor
are always hungry...

503
00:33:44,205 --> 00:33:47,405
they, uh... sir, I thank you.

504
00:33:47,469 --> 00:33:50,861
Stay and rest tonight.
I'll just stable your animal.

505
00:33:50,925 --> 00:33:56,429
See that your grooms care
for my fleet-footed Rosinante.

506
00:33:56,493 --> 00:34:01,133
A horse of courage,
sobriety, and chastity.

507
00:34:01,197 --> 00:34:04,333
A flower and glory
of horse flesh.

508
00:34:05,773 --> 00:34:07,821
Thank you, Master.

509
00:34:07,885 --> 00:34:11,181
- What's this madness?
- Aldonza!

510
00:34:11,245 --> 00:34:12,365
Has he got money to pay?

511
00:34:12,429 --> 00:34:15,021
When did a poor man
ever find time to run mad?

512
00:34:15,085 --> 00:34:16,813
He's got money.
He's a gentleman.

513
00:34:16,877 --> 00:34:19,053
Tell Aldonza
to bring him some wine.

514
00:34:25,165 --> 00:34:28,461
Gentle knights...

515
00:34:28,525 --> 00:34:30,445
fair chatelaine.

516
00:34:33,101 --> 00:34:36,397
If there be any amongst you
that require assistance...

517
00:34:36,461 --> 00:34:37,645
you have but to speak...

518
00:34:37,709 --> 00:34:41,485
and my good right arm
is at your service.

519
00:34:41,549 --> 00:34:45,197
Whether it be
a princess held to ransom...

520
00:34:45,261 --> 00:34:48,397
an army besieged...

521
00:34:48,461 --> 00:34:51,437
the fallen to be raised up...

522
00:34:51,501 --> 00:34:55,245
the suffering, the poor...

523
00:34:57,581 --> 00:35:01,902
Dear God. It is she.

524
00:35:05,422 --> 00:35:08,238
Sweet lady...

525
00:35:08,302 --> 00:35:10,414
fair virgin...

526
00:35:11,982 --> 00:35:16,430
I dare not gaze fully
upon thy countenance...

527
00:35:16,494 --> 00:35:18,638
as I'd be blinded by thy beauty.

528
00:35:18,702 --> 00:35:20,558
I'll get you the wine.

529
00:35:20,622 --> 00:35:23,598
Milady, you must not wait
upon my needs.

530
00:35:23,662 --> 00:35:26,958
I implore you,
speak once your name.

531
00:35:27,022 --> 00:35:29,262
Aldonza.

532
00:35:29,326 --> 00:35:32,686
- Milady jests.
- Aldonza!

533
00:35:32,750 --> 00:35:37,358
The name of a kitchen scullion
or milady's serving maid!

534
00:35:37,422 --> 00:35:38,510
I told you my name.

535
00:35:38,574 --> 00:35:41,198
Now get out of the way,
or I'Il... by Christ, I'Il...

536
00:35:48,078 --> 00:35:51,534
Milady,
think to put me to the test?

537
00:35:53,582 --> 00:35:56,590
Oh, sweet sovereign
of my captive heart...

538
00:35:56,654 --> 00:36:01,166
how could I fail thee
when I know...

539
00:36:01,230 --> 00:36:06,126
I have dreamed thee too long

540
00:36:06,190 --> 00:36:08,654
Never seen thee or touched thee

541
00:36:08,718 --> 00:36:14,926
But known thee
with all of my heart

542
00:36:14,990 --> 00:36:19,118
Half a prayer, half a song

543
00:36:19,182 --> 00:36:21,518
Thou hast always been with me

544
00:36:21,582 --> 00:36:27,086
Though we have been always apart

545
00:36:27,150 --> 00:36:30,990
Dulcinea

546
00:36:31,054 --> 00:36:34,446
Dulcinea

547
00:36:34,510 --> 00:36:38,702
I see heaven when I see thee

548
00:36:38,766 --> 00:36:42,926
Dulcinea

549
00:36:42,990 --> 00:36:51,279
And thy name is like a prayer
an angel whispers

550
00:36:51,343 --> 00:36:57,487
Dulcinea

551
00:36:57,551 --> 00:37:02,383
Dulcinea

552
00:37:02,447 --> 00:37:06,575
If I reach out to thee

553
00:37:06,639 --> 00:37:08,495
Do not tremble and shrink

554
00:37:08,559 --> 00:37:15,503
From the touch of my hand
on thy hair

555
00:37:15,567 --> 00:37:19,727
Let my fingers but see

556
00:37:19,791 --> 00:37:21,615
Thou art warm and alive

557
00:37:21,679 --> 00:37:27,503
And no phantom
to fade in the air

558
00:37:27,567 --> 00:37:31,247
Dulcinea

559
00:37:31,311 --> 00:37:34,799
Dulcinea

560
00:37:34,863 --> 00:37:38,255
I have sought thee,
sung thee, dreamed thee

561
00:37:38,319 --> 00:37:42,735
Dulcinea

562
00:37:42,799 --> 00:37:52,303
Now I've found thee, and
the world shall know thy glory

563
00:37:52,367 --> 00:37:59,823
Dulcinea

564
00:37:59,887 --> 00:38:11,759
Dulcinea

565
00:38:11,823 --> 00:38:15,695
Come along, Sir Knight.
I'll show you to your quarters.

566
00:38:29,968 --> 00:38:31,440
Dulcinea.

567
00:38:31,504 --> 00:38:33,392
Dulcinea.

568
00:38:33,456 --> 00:38:37,072
- Dulcinea!
- Dulcinea!

569
00:38:38,672 --> 00:38:41,968
Dulcinea

570
00:38:42,032 --> 00:38:44,560
Dulcinea

571
00:38:44,624 --> 00:38:48,176
I see heaven when I see thee

572
00:38:48,240 --> 00:38:50,608
- Dulcinea
- Dulcinea

573
00:38:50,672 --> 00:38:52,048
Filthy swine!

574
00:38:52,112 --> 00:38:56,944
And thy name is like a prayer
an angel whispers

575
00:38:57,008 --> 00:38:58,160
Sons of whores!

576
00:38:58,224 --> 00:39:01,168
Dulcinea

577
00:39:01,232 --> 00:39:04,624
Dulcinea

578
00:39:04,688 --> 00:39:07,856
Dulcinea

579
00:39:07,920 --> 00:39:10,672
Dulcinea

580
00:39:10,736 --> 00:39:14,256
I have sought thee,
sung thee, dreamed thee

581
00:39:14,320 --> 00:39:17,520
Dulcinea

582
00:39:17,584 --> 00:39:23,856
Now I've found thee, and
the world shall know thy glory

583
00:39:23,920 --> 00:39:27,120
Dulcinea

584
00:39:27,184 --> 00:39:30,640
Dulcinea

585
00:39:35,056 --> 00:39:37,104
- Halt!
- Bastards!

586
00:39:37,168 --> 00:39:40,048
Governor, this man proposed
to offer a defense.

587
00:39:40,112 --> 00:39:41,712
This is my defense.

588
00:39:41,776 --> 00:39:43,472
The most curious
I've ever heard.

589
00:39:43,536 --> 00:39:46,000
- But if it entertains?
- The word is "diverts."

590
00:39:46,064 --> 00:39:48,720
I think your purpose
is to divert us from ours.

591
00:39:48,784 --> 00:39:51,440
Precisely. May I go on?

592
00:39:51,504 --> 00:39:54,288
- Continue with your defense.
- Thank you.

593
00:39:54,352 --> 00:39:58,480
Imagine now the family
our brave night leaves behind.

594
00:39:58,544 --> 00:39:59,920
Not the lords and ladies...

595
00:39:59,984 --> 00:40:01,840
and retainers of
Don Quixote de La Mancha...

596
00:40:01,904 --> 00:40:05,200
but the simple womenfolk
of Alonso Quijana.

597
00:40:05,264 --> 00:40:07,472
Think of the shock
the news of his madness...

598
00:40:07,536 --> 00:40:09,553
- brings to his niece...
- Antonia.

599
00:40:09,617 --> 00:40:12,305
Antonia, who is concerned
about the effect...

600
00:40:12,369 --> 00:40:13,585
on her forthcoming marriage.

601
00:40:13,649 --> 00:40:14,801
Can't I have it?

602
00:40:14,865 --> 00:40:16,081
Afterwards, princess,
you can keep it...

603
00:40:16,145 --> 00:40:17,681
but now you're my niece
concerned about marriage.

604
00:40:17,745 --> 00:40:20,977
To his housekeeper
of many years...

605
00:40:21,041 --> 00:40:22,929
pious lady, come on, come on...

606
00:40:22,993 --> 00:40:25,297
concerned that devils and
darkness have overtaken him.

607
00:40:25,361 --> 00:40:29,137
- And to the local priest...
- Please let me be him.

608
00:40:29,201 --> 00:40:31,377
Who has known Alonso
all of his life. One priest.

609
00:40:31,441 --> 00:40:32,433
- Thank you.
- One priest!

610
00:40:32,497 --> 00:40:34,737
And, shortly, there will appear
a character...

611
00:40:34,801 --> 00:40:39,697
whose philosophy
may appeal enormously... to you!

612
00:40:39,761 --> 00:40:43,185
Antonia and the housekeeper
hurry to the church.

613
00:40:43,249 --> 00:40:45,105
- Church, please.
- The church.

614
00:40:45,169 --> 00:40:46,545
Anguished by the situation...

615
00:40:46,609 --> 00:40:50,513
and not wholly unaware of
what the neighbors may think...

616
00:40:50,577 --> 00:40:52,657
they seek advice
from the priest.

617
00:40:52,721 --> 00:40:53,969
Where's he gone?

618
00:40:55,889 --> 00:40:57,297
Reverence.

619
00:40:59,601 --> 00:41:00,881
To church.

620
00:41:02,033 --> 00:41:05,489
But in spite of the trouble
that Alonso's madness...

621
00:41:05,553 --> 00:41:08,337
will bring crashing
on their heads...

622
00:41:08,401 --> 00:41:12,881
you may be sure
they're only thinking of him.

623
00:41:20,913 --> 00:41:26,705
I'm only thinking of him

624
00:41:26,769 --> 00:41:31,921
I'm only thinking of him

625
00:41:31,985 --> 00:41:35,729
Whatever I may do or say

626
00:41:35,793 --> 00:41:39,345
I'm only thinking of him

627
00:41:39,409 --> 00:41:42,609
In my body, it's well known

628
00:41:42,673 --> 00:41:46,353
There is not one selfish bone

629
00:41:46,417 --> 00:41:53,234
I'm only thinking
and worrying about him

630
00:41:53,298 --> 00:41:55,858
I've been told
he's chasing dragons

631
00:41:55,922 --> 00:41:58,610
And I fear it may be true

632
00:41:58,674 --> 00:42:01,106
If my groom
should hear about it

633
00:42:01,170 --> 00:42:03,890
Heaven knows what he will do

634
00:42:03,954 --> 00:42:06,802
Oh, they say he seeks a lady

635
00:42:06,866 --> 00:42:09,490
Who his own true love shall be

636
00:42:09,554 --> 00:42:11,730
God forbid that in his madness

637
00:42:11,794 --> 00:42:14,770
He should ever think it's me

638
00:42:14,834 --> 00:42:18,610
If he should try,
I'll surely die

639
00:42:18,674 --> 00:42:25,970
And I will grimly
guard my honor as I cry

640
00:42:26,034 --> 00:42:29,554
- I'm only thinking of him
- I know, I know, my dear

641
00:42:29,618 --> 00:42:33,170
- I'm only thinking of him
- Of course you are, my dear

642
00:42:33,234 --> 00:42:39,634
- I'm only thinking of him
- I understand

643
00:42:39,698 --> 00:42:43,986
Woe

644
00:42:44,050 --> 00:42:46,866
Woe

645
00:42:46,930 --> 00:42:50,770
They're only thinking of him

646
00:42:50,834 --> 00:42:53,746
They're only thinking of him

647
00:42:53,810 --> 00:42:56,946
How saintly
is their plaintive plea

648
00:42:57,010 --> 00:43:00,434
They're only thinking of him

649
00:43:00,498 --> 00:43:03,762
What a comfort to be sure

650
00:43:03,826 --> 00:43:06,930
That their motives are so pure

651
00:43:06,994 --> 00:43:11,186
As they go
thinking and worrying

652
00:43:11,250 --> 00:43:22,642
About him

653
00:43:22,706 --> 00:43:23,314
Now there appears on the scene
a man of breeding...

654
00:43:23,314 --> 00:43:27,346
Now there appears on the scene
a man of breeding...

655
00:43:27,410 --> 00:43:29,586
intelligent, logical.

656
00:43:29,650 --> 00:43:32,627
Dr. Sanson Carrasco...

657
00:43:32,691 --> 00:43:34,707
Antonia's fiancé...

658
00:43:34,771 --> 00:43:36,403
bachelor of science...

659
00:43:36,467 --> 00:43:38,867
graduate of
the University of Salamanca...

660
00:43:38,931 --> 00:43:41,299
a man who carries
his own importance...

661
00:43:41,363 --> 00:43:43,763
as though afraid of breaking it.

662
00:43:43,827 --> 00:43:44,883
Indeed.

663
00:43:44,947 --> 00:43:46,707
Family quarrels get out of hand.

664
00:43:46,771 --> 00:43:47,955
Shh! Shh!

665
00:43:48,019 --> 00:43:49,107
Governor,
with your permission...

666
00:43:49,171 --> 00:43:50,547
and so much at stake
in the game...

667
00:43:50,611 --> 00:43:52,275
may I rearrange the pieces?

668
00:43:52,339 --> 00:43:55,763
Señor, you have our permission.

669
00:44:02,131 --> 00:44:05,075
The queen... cunning.

670
00:44:07,987 --> 00:44:10,867
The castle... formidable.

671
00:44:13,907 --> 00:44:17,203
The king... restricted.

672
00:44:17,267 --> 00:44:20,723
The bishop... charmingly diagonal.

673
00:44:20,787 --> 00:44:24,275
And now
the problem of the knight.

674
00:44:29,427 --> 00:44:30,643
My dear, your uncle...

675
00:44:30,707 --> 00:44:33,523
is the laughingstock
of the entire neighborhood...

676
00:44:33,587 --> 00:44:36,051
and I do not relish
claiming a lunatic as an uncle.

677
00:44:36,115 --> 00:44:38,803
Oh, come, come, doctor.
The good Señor Quijana...

678
00:44:38,867 --> 00:44:41,843
has been carried away
by his imagination.

679
00:44:41,907 --> 00:44:46,483
Señor Quijana has lost his mind
and is suffering from delusions.

680
00:44:46,547 --> 00:44:49,043
- Is there a difference?
- Exactitude of meaning.

681
00:44:49,107 --> 00:44:50,707
I beg to remind you
I am a doctor.

682
00:44:50,771 --> 00:44:53,875
The innocent must pay
for the sins of the guilty.

683
00:44:53,939 --> 00:44:56,723
Guilty? Of what?
Of gentle delusion?

684
00:44:56,787 --> 00:44:59,251
How do you know it is gentle?
He was armed.

685
00:44:59,315 --> 00:45:01,523
With sword and lance.

686
00:45:01,587 --> 00:45:05,715
I cannot favor the madness that
puts a sword into his hand...

687
00:45:05,779 --> 00:45:08,819
but I can love the gentle
spirit that moves him...

688
00:45:08,883 --> 00:45:10,355
to measure his sword with evil.

689
00:45:10,419 --> 00:45:12,755
I shall concern myself
with his madness, father...

690
00:45:12,819 --> 00:45:15,412
and leave the care
of his spirit in your hands.

691
00:45:16,628 --> 00:45:20,948
Sanson? I had hoped for so much
for us, for you, really.

692
00:45:21,012 --> 00:45:23,220
Everything was to be for you...

693
00:45:23,284 --> 00:45:25,492
my uncle's house, his lands.

694
00:45:25,556 --> 00:45:29,780
That's true, doctor. In time,
they would all be yours.

695
00:45:29,844 --> 00:45:31,604
Or you a priest or pawnbroker?

696
00:45:33,076 --> 00:45:35,732
What I meant was...

697
00:45:35,796 --> 00:45:37,812
- consider the challenge.
- Challenge?

698
00:45:37,876 --> 00:45:40,148
Think what cleverness
it would take...

699
00:45:40,212 --> 00:45:41,940
to wean him from his madness.

700
00:45:42,004 --> 00:45:43,476
Turn him from his course.

701
00:45:43,540 --> 00:45:46,100
To persuade him
to come back home.

702
00:45:46,164 --> 00:45:49,172
To bring him to see
the same world?

703
00:45:49,236 --> 00:45:51,892
Hmm. That is a challenge.

704
00:45:51,956 --> 00:45:53,332
Enormous.

705
00:45:53,396 --> 00:45:55,444
To work within his lunacy...

706
00:45:55,508 --> 00:45:58,676
to cure him through
the very terms that are his own.

707
00:46:00,308 --> 00:46:02,164
Come, father. We shall do it.

708
00:46:03,444 --> 00:46:06,836
We will return now to the inn,
the kitchen.

709
00:46:06,900 --> 00:46:08,148
Yay!

710
00:46:12,276 --> 00:46:16,276
It is imperative
each knight has a lady...

711
00:46:16,340 --> 00:46:18,676
for a knight without a lady...

712
00:46:18,740 --> 00:46:21,556
is a body without a soul.

713
00:46:21,620 --> 00:46:24,692
To whom would he dedicate
his conquests?

714
00:46:24,756 --> 00:46:29,268
What vision sustain him when
he sallies forth to do battle...

715
00:46:29,332 --> 00:46:33,076
with evil and with giants?

716
00:46:33,140 --> 00:46:35,636
Don Quixote,
having found his lady...

717
00:46:35,700 --> 00:46:38,068
sends Sancho Panza to her
with a missive.

718
00:46:38,132 --> 00:46:40,724
Missive? What's a missive?

719
00:46:40,788 --> 00:46:42,196
It's a sort of letter.

720
00:46:42,260 --> 00:46:44,436
He warned me to give it
only into your hands.

721
00:46:44,500 --> 00:46:46,068
Well, let's see it.

722
00:46:47,860 --> 00:46:49,396
I can't read.

723
00:46:49,460 --> 00:46:53,492
Neither can I, but my master,
foreseeing such a possibility...

724
00:46:53,556 --> 00:46:55,924
recited it to me,
so I could commit it to heart.

725
00:46:55,988 --> 00:46:57,237
What made him think
I couldn't read?

726
00:46:57,301 --> 00:46:59,157
Well, as he explained it...

727
00:46:59,221 --> 00:47:00,981
most noblewomen are so busy
with their needlework...

728
00:47:01,045 --> 00:47:02,101
Needlework?

729
00:47:02,165 --> 00:47:03,733
Embroidering banners
for their knights...

730
00:47:03,797 --> 00:47:05,749
he said they had no time
for study.

731
00:47:05,813 --> 00:47:07,125
What's it say?

732
00:47:08,789 --> 00:47:11,797
Hmm

733
00:47:11,861 --> 00:47:16,501
Most lovely sovereign
and highborn lady

734
00:47:16,565 --> 00:47:19,285
The heart of this,
thy vassal knight

735
00:47:19,349 --> 00:47:21,781
Faints for thy favor

736
00:47:21,845 --> 00:47:24,597
Oh, fairest of the fair

737
00:47:24,661 --> 00:47:27,221
Purest of the pure

738
00:47:27,285 --> 00:47:30,613
Incomparable Dulcinea

739
00:47:30,677 --> 00:47:33,493
Oh, that again!
My name is Aldonza.

740
00:47:33,557 --> 00:47:35,573
- Master calls you Dulcinea.
- Why?

741
00:47:35,637 --> 00:47:37,653
I don't know, but I can
tell you from experience...

742
00:47:37,717 --> 00:47:40,213
that knights have their own
language for everything...

743
00:47:40,277 --> 00:47:42,037
and it's better
not to ask questions.

744
00:47:42,101 --> 00:47:44,853
It only gets you into trouble.

745
00:47:44,917 --> 00:47:46,293
Ahem.

746
00:47:46,357 --> 00:47:49,173
I beg thee grant
that I may kiss

747
00:47:49,237 --> 00:47:52,469
The nethermost hem
of thy garment

748
00:47:52,533 --> 00:47:53,685
Kiss my what?

749
00:47:53,749 --> 00:47:55,413
If you keep interrupting me
like this...

750
00:47:55,477 --> 00:47:57,013
the whole thing will be gone
right out of my head.

751
00:47:57,077 --> 00:48:00,245
- Well, what's he want?
- I'm getting to it.

752
00:48:00,309 --> 00:48:01,429
I beg thee grant
that I may kiss

753
00:48:01,493 --> 00:48:04,213
The nethermost hem
of thy garment

754
00:48:04,277 --> 00:48:07,861
And send to me a token
of thy fair esteem

755
00:48:07,925 --> 00:48:12,949
That I may carry
as my standard into battle

756
00:48:13,013 --> 00:48:14,677
What kind of a token?

757
00:48:14,741 --> 00:48:17,429
He says generally
it's a silken scarf.

758
00:48:17,493 --> 00:48:19,509
Why, your master's
a crack-brain.

759
00:48:19,573 --> 00:48:22,453
Well, they say one madman
makes a hundred...

760
00:48:22,517 --> 00:48:24,789
and love makes a thousand.

761
00:48:24,853 --> 00:48:27,605
- What does that mean?
- I'm not sure.

762
00:48:27,669 --> 00:48:30,453
You're crazy, too.

763
00:48:30,517 --> 00:48:32,853
- What are you waiting for?
- The token.

764
00:48:32,917 --> 00:48:35,733
I'll give him a token. Here!

765
00:48:35,797 --> 00:48:37,205
But, milady...

766
00:48:37,269 --> 00:48:39,926
Don't you milady me,
or I'll crack you like an egg.

767
00:48:41,398 --> 00:48:43,734
Hey, wait a moment.

768
00:48:43,798 --> 00:48:45,014
Come here.

769
00:48:45,078 --> 00:48:47,894
Come. Tell me.

770
00:48:47,958 --> 00:48:49,814
Why do you follow him, huh?

771
00:48:49,878 --> 00:48:52,054
Oh, that's easy to explain.

772
00:48:52,118 --> 00:48:56,150
It's a... it's a...
well, it's a sort of crusade.

773
00:48:56,214 --> 00:48:57,270
Crusade?

774
00:48:57,334 --> 00:48:59,638
And then there's
all those people in distress.

775
00:48:59,702 --> 00:49:00,758
Distress?

776
00:49:00,822 --> 00:49:04,566
And, uh, well, uh,
because, um...

777
00:49:04,630 --> 00:49:06,966
- Why?
- I'm telling you.

778
00:49:07,030 --> 00:49:08,758
- Because, um...
- Why?

779
00:49:11,030 --> 00:49:12,534
I like him.

780
00:49:15,190 --> 00:49:16,950
I really like him.

781
00:49:21,078 --> 00:49:24,598
Tear out my fingernails

782
00:49:24,662 --> 00:49:27,542
One by one

783
00:49:27,606 --> 00:49:31,414
I like him

784
00:49:31,478 --> 00:49:34,646
- That's no reason.
- I don't have

785
00:49:34,710 --> 00:49:38,230
A very good reason

786
00:49:38,294 --> 00:49:40,534
Since I've been with him

787
00:49:40,598 --> 00:49:46,134
Cuckoo nuts have been in season

788
00:49:46,198 --> 00:49:50,326
- You are crazy.
- But there's nothing I can do

789
00:49:50,390 --> 00:49:54,934
Chop me up for onion stew

790
00:49:54,998 --> 00:49:57,206
Still I'll yell to the sky

791
00:49:57,270 --> 00:49:59,062
Though I can't tell you why

792
00:49:59,126 --> 00:50:04,342
That I like him

793
00:50:04,406 --> 00:50:05,558
He doesn't make any sense.

794
00:50:05,622 --> 00:50:07,446
Well, that's because
you're not a squire.

795
00:50:07,510 --> 00:50:10,422
All right, you're a squire.
How does a squire squire?

796
00:50:10,486 --> 00:50:13,046
Well, I ride behind him...

797
00:50:13,110 --> 00:50:16,470
and he fights, and then
I pick him up off the ground.

798
00:50:16,534 --> 00:50:17,622
What do you get out of it?

799
00:50:17,686 --> 00:50:19,542
- What do I get?
- Yes.

800
00:50:19,606 --> 00:50:22,263
Plenty.
Why, already I've gotten...

801
00:50:22,327 --> 00:50:25,015
You've gotten nothing,
so why do you do it?

802
00:50:25,079 --> 00:50:28,823
I like him

803
00:50:28,887 --> 00:50:32,471
I really like him

804
00:50:32,535 --> 00:50:36,407
Pluck me naked
as a scalded chicken

805
00:50:36,471 --> 00:50:39,991
I like him

806
00:50:40,055 --> 00:50:42,807
Don't ask me

807
00:50:42,871 --> 00:50:46,487
For why or wherefore

808
00:50:46,551 --> 00:50:51,063
'Cause I don't have
a single good because

809
00:50:51,127 --> 00:50:54,583
Or therefore

810
00:50:54,647 --> 00:50:57,943
You can chop me for croquettes

811
00:50:58,007 --> 00:51:01,751
Beat my bones like castanets

812
00:51:01,815 --> 00:51:03,863
Make me freeze, make me fry

813
00:51:03,927 --> 00:51:05,463
Make me sigh, make me cry

814
00:51:05,527 --> 00:51:07,415
Still I'll yell to the sky

815
00:51:07,479 --> 00:51:09,527
Though I can't tell you why

816
00:51:09,591 --> 00:51:15,607
That I like him

817
00:51:24,823 --> 00:51:28,631
"Fairest of the fair.
Kiss the hem of thy garment."

818
00:51:32,343 --> 00:51:33,719
"Incomparable."

819
00:51:44,503 --> 00:51:45,847
"Dulcinea."

820
00:52:02,199 --> 00:52:03,415
Your Grace!

821
00:52:04,600 --> 00:52:07,256
Milady received thee?

822
00:52:08,344 --> 00:52:10,872
Oh, most fortunate of squires.

823
00:52:10,936 --> 00:52:14,776
The token. What of the token?

824
00:52:23,320 --> 00:52:26,136
Gossamer.

825
00:52:26,200 --> 00:52:28,056
Purest gossamer.

826
00:52:30,360 --> 00:52:31,544
Forgive me.

827
00:52:33,880 --> 00:52:34,968
I'm overcome.

828
00:52:37,240 --> 00:52:39,320
Oh, I am a little barber

829
00:52:39,384 --> 00:52:42,072
And I go my merry way

830
00:52:42,136 --> 00:52:44,536
With my razor and my basin

831
00:52:44,600 --> 00:52:47,832
I can always earn my pay

832
00:52:47,896 --> 00:52:49,752
Somebody approacheth!

833
00:52:49,816 --> 00:52:51,864
Though your chin
be smooth as satin

834
00:52:51,928 --> 00:52:55,032
You will need me soon, I know

835
00:52:55,096 --> 00:52:56,984
For the lord
protects his barbers

836
00:52:57,048 --> 00:53:01,112
And he makes the stubble grow

837
00:53:01,176 --> 00:53:03,608
Well, good day, gentlemen.

838
00:53:03,672 --> 00:53:05,720
It's just an ordinary traveler.

839
00:53:05,784 --> 00:53:06,904
Nay!

840
00:53:08,216 --> 00:53:11,032
See what he weareth on his head.

841
00:53:11,096 --> 00:53:13,240
By all the saints...

842
00:53:13,304 --> 00:53:16,856
there is a fortune
to be made right here.

843
00:53:18,264 --> 00:53:20,920
Arm thyself. This encounter
may be perilous.

844
00:53:20,984 --> 00:53:22,872
Oh, dear.

845
00:53:22,936 --> 00:53:25,304
If I slip
while I am shaving you

846
00:53:25,368 --> 00:53:27,992
And cut you to the quick

847
00:53:28,056 --> 00:53:30,296
You can use me as a doctor

848
00:53:30,360 --> 00:53:32,856
'Cause I also heal the sick

849
00:53:32,920 --> 00:53:36,024
Well, shall you be my...
shall you be my first to...

850
00:53:36,088 --> 00:53:38,584
You... you... you should be
my... my first...

851
00:54:00,633 --> 00:54:03,449
Oh, by the beard
of St. Anthony...

852
00:54:03,513 --> 00:54:07,481
I do believe I see before me...

853
00:54:07,545 --> 00:54:09,785
a knight...

854
00:54:09,849 --> 00:54:12,601
in full armor.

855
00:54:14,073 --> 00:54:17,785
It's ridiculous.
There aren't any knights!

856
00:54:17,849 --> 00:54:21,977
- What?
- I was wrong. Forgive me.

857
00:54:22,041 --> 00:54:26,681
Forgive me, your... your... bigness.

858
00:54:26,745 --> 00:54:29,369
I thought I'd been
touched by the sun.

859
00:54:29,433 --> 00:54:31,417
Thou wilt be touched by worse...

860
00:54:31,481 --> 00:54:34,969
unless thou surrender rapidly
that golden helmet...

861
00:54:35,033 --> 00:54:36,761
which is justly mine.

862
00:54:36,825 --> 00:54:39,065
Golden helmet?

863
00:54:46,169 --> 00:54:48,537
But this is a shaving basin.

864
00:54:48,601 --> 00:54:51,257
Shaving basin. Mister...

865
00:54:51,321 --> 00:54:54,073
I must say, Your Grace, it does
look like a shaving basin.

866
00:54:54,137 --> 00:54:58,329
Oh, oh, yes.
Yes. It's a shaving basin.

867
00:54:58,393 --> 00:55:03,865
I'm a barber. I was merely
wearing this for my head...

868
00:55:03,929 --> 00:55:08,665
to... to ward off the rays
of the sun, you see...

869
00:55:08,729 --> 00:55:11,353
so that's how your highship
made the mistake of...

870
00:55:11,417 --> 00:55:13,177
Silence!

871
00:55:13,241 --> 00:55:17,401
Knowest thou
what that really is?

872
00:55:17,465 --> 00:55:18,649
Uh-uh.

873
00:55:18,713 --> 00:55:21,593
The golden helmet of Mambrino.

874
00:55:21,657 --> 00:55:23,513
When worn
by one of noble heart...

875
00:55:23,577 --> 00:55:27,225
it rendereth him invulnerable
to all wounds.

876
00:55:27,289 --> 00:55:30,202
From what fallen knight
didst thou steal it?

877
00:55:30,266 --> 00:55:32,730
I didn't steal it.

878
00:55:32,794 --> 00:55:35,194
- Surrender it!
- Well, it cost me half a crown!

879
00:55:35,258 --> 00:55:36,602
Surrender it, or I'll split... -

880
00:55:36,666 --> 00:55:40,410
I must say, Your Grace,
it is worth half a crown.

881
00:55:41,946 --> 00:55:43,642
Peasant.

882
00:55:45,434 --> 00:55:50,906
Thou golden helmet of Mambrino

883
00:55:50,970 --> 00:55:55,578
With so illustrious a past

884
00:55:55,642 --> 00:56:00,250
Too long hast thou
been lost to glory

885
00:56:00,314 --> 00:56:05,114
But rediscovered now at last

886
00:56:05,178 --> 00:56:09,946
Golden helmet of Mambrino

887
00:56:10,010 --> 00:56:14,586
There can be no helm like thee

888
00:56:14,650 --> 00:56:17,018
Thou and I now

889
00:56:17,082 --> 00:56:19,194
Ere I die now

890
00:56:19,258 --> 00:56:24,090
Will make golden history

891
00:56:24,154 --> 00:56:26,298
I can hear the cuckoo singing

892
00:56:26,362 --> 00:56:29,210
In the cuckoo berry tree

893
00:56:29,274 --> 00:56:31,162
If he says that that's a helmet

894
00:56:31,226 --> 00:56:34,490
I suggest that you agree

895
00:56:34,554 --> 00:56:36,570
But he'll find it is not golden

896
00:56:36,634 --> 00:56:39,514
Will not make him
bold and brave

897
00:56:39,578 --> 00:56:41,914
Well, at least
he'll find it useful

898
00:56:41,978 --> 00:56:44,250
If he ever needs a shave

899
00:56:54,010 --> 00:56:57,626
Golden helmet

900
00:56:57,690 --> 00:57:00,986
Of Mambrino

901
00:57:01,050 --> 00:57:04,474
There can be no

902
00:57:04,538 --> 00:57:08,154
Helm like thee

903
00:57:08,218 --> 00:57:11,771
Thou and I now

904
00:57:11,835 --> 00:57:15,195
Ere I die now

905
00:57:15,259 --> 00:57:20,923
Will make golden

906
00:57:20,987 --> 00:57:30,875
History

907
00:58:26,075 --> 00:58:29,211
Are you saying your prayers?

908
00:58:29,275 --> 00:58:32,763
I thought you'd like
some refreshment, then supper.

909
00:58:33,915 --> 00:58:37,051
- Sir Castellano.
- Sir Knight.

910
00:58:41,211 --> 00:58:43,195
I would make a confession.

911
00:58:43,259 --> 00:58:45,339
To me?

912
00:58:48,155 --> 00:58:55,004
I would confess
I have never been dubbed knight.

913
00:58:55,068 --> 00:58:56,764
Oh. That's bad.

914
00:58:56,828 --> 00:58:59,612
But I am well qualified, milord.

915
00:58:59,676 --> 00:59:03,132
I am brave and courteous,
bold and generous...

916
00:59:03,196 --> 00:59:04,860
affable and patient.

917
00:59:04,924 --> 00:59:07,516
Yes. That's the list.

918
00:59:07,580 --> 00:59:11,612
Therefore
I would beg a boon of thee.

919
00:59:11,676 --> 00:59:14,268
Anything... within reason.

920
00:59:14,332 --> 00:59:19,036
Tonight, I will hold vigil
in the chapel of thy castle...

921
00:59:19,100 --> 00:59:23,548
and, at dawn,
receive from your hand...

922
00:59:23,612 --> 00:59:27,196
the ennobling stroke
of knighthood.

923
00:59:27,260 --> 00:59:31,740
But there's one small
difficulty... no chapel.

924
00:59:34,748 --> 00:59:38,684
- No chapel?
- That is, it's being restored.

925
00:59:38,748 --> 00:59:40,252
Now, if you wouldn't mind...

926
00:59:40,316 --> 00:59:43,484
holding your vigil
some other place?

927
00:59:43,548 --> 00:59:46,300
Here in the courtyard...

928
00:59:48,188 --> 00:59:49,564
under the stars.

929
00:59:49,628 --> 00:59:54,524
Of course. At dawn,
you shall be dubbed knight.

930
00:59:54,588 --> 00:59:55,772
Milord...

931
00:59:57,244 --> 00:59:59,324
I thank you.

932
00:59:59,388 --> 01:00:01,404
Now will you have some supper?

933
01:00:01,468 --> 01:00:04,604
Before a vigil? Nay, milord.

934
01:00:04,668 --> 01:00:09,372
On this night, I must fast
and compose my spirit.

935
01:01:34,173 --> 01:01:37,373
We have come for Don Quixote,
Knight of La Mancha.

936
01:01:37,437 --> 01:01:40,061
We have word
he stays at this inn.

937
01:01:40,125 --> 01:01:42,749
Yes, Your Grace,
he does stay here.

938
01:01:42,813 --> 01:01:46,013
My sister, this great lady
would speak with him.

939
01:01:46,077 --> 01:01:49,725
The drums sound!
Why am I summoned?

940
01:01:49,789 --> 01:01:51,261
Are you the man we seek?

941
01:01:51,325 --> 01:01:53,853
I am Don Quixote, de La Mancha.

942
01:01:53,917 --> 01:01:56,605
Fire cannot be hidden.

943
01:01:56,669 --> 01:01:59,261
Virtue cannot fail
to be recognized.

944
01:01:59,325 --> 01:02:00,925
Cease your praises.

945
01:02:00,989 --> 01:02:04,541
Word of your renown met us
on the very shores of Spain.

946
01:02:04,605 --> 01:02:07,421
You have no need
to sue for favor.

947
01:02:07,485 --> 01:02:10,333
Only say how I may help you.

948
01:02:14,205 --> 01:02:16,445
Milady, you must not kneel.

949
01:02:16,509 --> 01:02:19,166
I shall not rise until
you grant the boon I ask.

950
01:02:19,230 --> 01:02:22,206
I grant it freely.

951
01:02:23,806 --> 01:02:27,678
The Great Enchanter has brought
unhappiness to us all.

952
01:02:27,742 --> 01:02:29,598
Your enemy.

953
01:02:29,662 --> 01:02:32,638
He has bewitched our brother.

954
01:02:32,702 --> 01:02:35,198
Turned him to stone.

955
01:02:35,262 --> 01:02:37,406
He will not regain
his former self...

956
01:02:37,470 --> 01:02:40,446
until Don Quixote
joins in single combat...

957
01:02:40,510 --> 01:02:41,950
with the Enchanter.

958
01:02:48,222 --> 01:02:51,070
Have the fates
indeed reserved...

959
01:02:51,134 --> 01:02:54,494
this unparalleled adventure
for my sword?

960
01:02:56,862 --> 01:03:00,990
Assist me, sweet Dulcinea.

961
01:03:02,142 --> 01:03:04,222
Let not your favor
and protection...

962
01:03:04,286 --> 01:03:07,038
fail me in this, my first trial.

963
01:03:08,862 --> 01:03:11,166
Where shall I find
the Enchanter?

964
01:03:11,230 --> 01:03:14,270
Declare yourself,
and he will find you.

965
01:03:14,334 --> 01:03:16,478
Pray well, Don Quixote.

966
01:03:16,542 --> 01:03:20,638
Pray power into thine arm,
a keen edge to thy sword...

967
01:03:20,702 --> 01:03:23,006
and courage into thy soul.

968
01:03:23,070 --> 01:03:26,398
I shall take my prayers up
in the chapel.

969
01:03:27,838 --> 01:03:29,918
Here is my arm.

970
01:03:52,478 --> 01:03:54,622
Is this the lady Dulcinea?

971
01:03:55,838 --> 01:03:57,694
The gentleman's talking to you.

972
01:03:57,758 --> 01:04:00,895
- Ah!
- Dulcinea.

973
01:04:00,959 --> 01:04:02,623
Her name's Aldonza.

974
01:04:02,687 --> 01:04:06,751
The old gentleman, he took
a fancy to calling her Dulcinea.

975
01:04:06,815 --> 01:04:08,191
Where's this chapel?

976
01:04:08,255 --> 01:04:10,111
How does it happen
a wretched tavern like this...

977
01:04:10,175 --> 01:04:11,327
can boast a chapel?

978
01:04:11,391 --> 01:04:13,695
It isn't a chapel, Your Grace.

979
01:04:13,759 --> 01:04:15,103
He's in the stable.

980
01:04:15,167 --> 01:04:17,343
Ah, another excess
of imagination.

981
01:04:17,407 --> 01:04:18,783
How does it harm anyone?

982
01:04:18,847 --> 01:04:20,991
You're more of a fool
than he is...

983
01:04:21,055 --> 01:04:23,807
playing tricks on a man
who is mad. Leave me!

984
01:04:23,871 --> 01:04:28,991
One might say Jesus was mad...
or St. Francis.

985
01:04:29,055 --> 01:04:33,311
A man who chooses to be mad
can also choose to be sane.

986
01:04:33,375 --> 01:04:37,535
Oh, yes. It was easy enough
planning this enterprise...

987
01:04:37,599 --> 01:04:40,895
but it will be difficult
to come out of it well.

988
01:04:40,959 --> 01:04:43,871
May not the cure be more cruel
than the disease?

989
01:04:43,935 --> 01:04:46,271
We have given reality
to his madness.

990
01:04:46,335 --> 01:04:48,191
We cannot abandon him now.

991
01:04:48,255 --> 01:04:50,591
We have said
he will meet the Enchanter.

992
01:04:50,655 --> 01:04:52,287
He must meet him.

993
01:05:31,038 --> 01:05:35,070
Little bird, little bird

994
01:05:36,350 --> 01:05:38,205
Awoo!

995
01:05:38,269 --> 01:05:42,013
In the cinnamon tree

996
01:05:42,013 --> 01:05:42,749
In the cinnamon tree

997
01:05:46,013 --> 01:05:50,492
Little bird, little bird

998
01:05:53,692 --> 01:05:58,204
Do you sing for me?

999
01:06:02,811 --> 01:06:07,707
Do you bring me word

1000
01:06:07,771 --> 01:06:12,186
Of one I know?

1001
01:06:12,250 --> 01:06:14,714
Little bird, little bird

1002
01:06:14,778 --> 01:06:17,082
I love her so

1003
01:06:17,146 --> 01:06:19,002
Little bird, little bird

1004
01:06:19,066 --> 01:06:21,402
And I have to know

1005
01:06:21,466 --> 01:06:25,241
Little bird, little bird

1006
01:06:25,305 --> 01:06:30,041
Beneath this tree

1007
01:06:30,105 --> 01:06:33,913
This cinnamon tree

1008
01:06:33,977 --> 01:06:38,200
We learned to love

1009
01:06:38,264 --> 01:06:42,104
We learned to cry

1010
01:06:42,168 --> 01:06:46,679
For here we met

1011
01:06:46,743 --> 01:06:50,359
And here we kissed

1012
01:06:50,423 --> 01:06:54,839
And here
one cold and moonless night

1013
01:06:54,903 --> 01:06:58,838
We said good-bye

1014
01:06:58,902 --> 01:07:01,398
Little bird, little bird

1015
01:07:01,462 --> 01:07:03,478
Little bird, little bird

1016
01:07:03,542 --> 01:07:05,558
Oh, have pity on me

1017
01:07:05,622 --> 01:07:07,478
Little bird, little bird

1018
01:07:07,542 --> 01:07:09,397
Bring her back to me now

1019
01:07:09,461 --> 01:07:11,541
Little bird, little bird

1020
01:07:11,605 --> 01:07:13,557
Beneath the cinnamon tree

1021
01:07:13,621 --> 01:07:15,893
Little bird, little bird

1022
01:07:15,957 --> 01:07:18,933
I have waited too long

1023
01:07:18,997 --> 01:07:20,052
Little bird

1024
01:07:20,116 --> 01:07:23,092
Without a song

1025
01:07:23,156 --> 01:07:26,228
- Little bird,
- Little bird, little bird

1026
01:07:26,292 --> 01:07:28,052
Please fly, please go

1027
01:07:28,116 --> 01:07:30,452
Little bird, little bird

1028
01:07:30,516 --> 01:07:32,435
And tell her so

1029
01:07:32,499 --> 01:07:36,691
Little bird, little bird

1030
01:07:36,755 --> 01:07:42,930
Little bird, little bird

1031
01:07:42,994 --> 01:07:45,330
- Sss!
- Awoo!

1032
01:07:45,394 --> 01:07:47,538
I spit on all your little birds!

1033
01:07:49,362 --> 01:07:50,418
Here!

1034
01:07:50,482 --> 01:07:52,306
Give it back!
Give it back to me!

1035
01:07:52,370 --> 01:07:53,458
What's this?

1036
01:07:53,522 --> 01:07:55,665
- "The most lovely sovereign...
- Oh!

1037
01:07:55,729 --> 01:07:58,257
"And high-born lady..."

1038
01:07:58,321 --> 01:08:00,209
It's from her knight!

1039
01:08:02,193 --> 01:08:04,113
It's a love letter.

1040
01:08:05,297 --> 01:08:08,336
- Such fine words.
- Well, fine words!

1041
01:08:08,400 --> 01:08:10,704
All right.
He's a man, isn't he?

1042
01:08:10,768 --> 01:08:12,912
He wants what
every other man wants. So!

1043
01:08:12,976 --> 01:08:14,608
- Yeah!
- Yeah!

1044
01:08:17,423 --> 01:08:20,431
Hey... soon?

1045
01:08:20,495 --> 01:08:22,959
When I'm through in the kitchen.

1046
01:09:30,121 --> 01:09:33,801
Now I must consider
how sages of the future...

1047
01:09:33,865 --> 01:09:36,905
will describe
this historic night.

1048
01:09:40,392 --> 01:09:44,168
Long after the sun
had retired to his couch...

1049
01:09:44,232 --> 01:09:47,720
darkening the gates
and balconies of La Mancha...

1050
01:09:47,784 --> 01:09:51,847
Don Quixote, with lofty
expression and measured tread...

1051
01:09:51,911 --> 01:09:55,623
held vigil in the courtyard
of a mighty castle.

1052
01:09:57,543 --> 01:09:59,271
Ohh.

1053
01:10:00,806 --> 01:10:04,358
Maker of empty boasts...

1054
01:10:04,422 --> 01:10:07,302
on this of all nights
to give way to vanity.

1055
01:10:08,902 --> 01:10:14,597
No. Don Quixote,
take a deep breath of life...

1056
01:10:14,661 --> 01:10:17,893
and consider
how it should be lived.

1057
01:10:22,821 --> 01:10:27,428
Call nothing thine
except thy soul.

1058
01:10:28,580 --> 01:10:32,836
Love not what thou art,
only what thou may become.

1059
01:10:32,900 --> 01:10:35,843
Do not pursue pleasure...

1060
01:10:35,907 --> 01:10:39,811
or thou mayest have
the misfortune to overtake it.

1061
01:10:41,539 --> 01:10:43,875
Look always forward.

1062
01:10:43,939 --> 01:10:46,146
In last year's nests...

1063
01:10:48,866 --> 01:10:52,610
there are no birds this year.

1064
01:10:54,018 --> 01:10:58,753
Be just to all men,
courteous to all women.

1065
01:10:58,817 --> 01:11:01,537
Live in the vision...

1066
01:11:01,601 --> 01:11:07,393
of the one for whom
great deeds are done...

1067
01:11:07,457 --> 01:11:08,833
Dulcinea.

1068
01:11:08,896 --> 01:11:11,392
Get up from there! Get up!

1069
01:11:11,456 --> 01:11:12,832
Milady.

1070
01:11:12,896 --> 01:11:14,432
Why do you call me
by that name?

1071
01:11:14,496 --> 01:11:17,312
- Because it is yours.
- My name is Aldonza!

1072
01:11:17,376 --> 01:11:19,392
I know you, milady.

1073
01:11:19,456 --> 01:11:21,439
I think you know me not.

1074
01:11:21,503 --> 01:11:25,471
All my years I have known you,
your nobility of spirit...

1075
01:11:25,535 --> 01:11:28,511
long have I seen you
in my heart.

1076
01:11:28,575 --> 01:11:30,943
Your heart
doesn't know much about women.

1077
01:11:31,007 --> 01:11:33,502
It knows all, milady.

1078
01:11:33,566 --> 01:11:36,094
Woman is the soul of man...

1079
01:11:36,158 --> 01:11:38,974
the radiance
that lights his way.

1080
01:11:39,038 --> 01:11:42,270
Woman is glory.

1081
01:11:43,421 --> 01:11:45,085
What do you want of me?

1082
01:11:45,149 --> 01:11:47,069
- Nothing.
- Liar.

1083
01:11:47,133 --> 01:11:48,957
I deserve the rebuke.

1084
01:11:49,021 --> 01:11:51,709
- I ask of milady...
- Now we get to it!

1085
01:11:53,245 --> 01:11:56,060
That I may be allowed
to serve her...

1086
01:11:56,124 --> 01:11:59,036
that I may hold her
in my heart...

1087
01:11:59,100 --> 01:12:02,684
that to her
I may dedicate each victory...

1088
01:12:02,748 --> 01:12:06,044
and call upon her in defeat.

1089
01:12:06,140 --> 01:12:09,755
And if at last I give my life...

1090
01:12:09,819 --> 01:12:14,075
I give it
in the sacred name of Dulcinea.

1091
01:12:15,739 --> 01:12:19,642
I must go. Pedro is waiting.

1092
01:12:19,706 --> 01:12:21,114
Why do you do these things?

1093
01:12:21,178 --> 01:12:22,874
What things?

1094
01:12:22,938 --> 01:12:25,018
These ridiculous...
the things you do.

1095
01:12:25,082 --> 01:12:28,986
I come in a world of iron...

1096
01:12:29,050 --> 01:12:31,513
to make a world of gold.

1097
01:12:31,577 --> 01:12:33,657
The world's a dung heap...

1098
01:12:33,721 --> 01:12:36,217
and we are maggots
that crawl on it.

1099
01:12:36,281 --> 01:12:38,521
No.

1100
01:12:38,585 --> 01:12:40,984
Milady knows better
in her heart.

1101
01:12:41,080 --> 01:12:44,856
What's in my heart
will get me halfway to hell...

1102
01:12:44,920 --> 01:12:46,776
and you, Señor Don Quixote...

1103
01:12:46,840 --> 01:12:49,464
your head is going to end up
a stranger to your neck.

1104
01:12:49,528 --> 01:12:52,023
- That doesn't matter.
- What does?

1105
01:12:52,087 --> 01:12:54,167
Only that I follow the quest.

1106
01:12:55,575 --> 01:12:56,983
That for your quest.

1107
01:12:59,479 --> 01:13:03,223
What does it mean... quest?

1108
01:13:03,287 --> 01:13:08,726
The mission of each true knight
is duty...

1109
01:13:08,790 --> 01:13:11,990
nay, is privilege.

1110
01:13:13,590 --> 01:13:18,485
To dream the impossible dream

1111
01:13:18,549 --> 01:13:23,285
To fight the unbeatable foe

1112
01:13:23,349 --> 01:13:28,692
To bear with unbearable sorrow

1113
01:13:28,756 --> 01:13:33,844
To run
where the brave dare not go

1114
01:13:33,908 --> 01:13:38,995
To right the unrightable wrong

1115
01:13:39,059 --> 01:13:44,403
To love
pure and chaste from afar

1116
01:13:44,467 --> 01:13:49,682
To try when your arms
are too weary

1117
01:13:49,746 --> 01:13:54,482
To reach the unreachable star

1118
01:13:54,546 --> 01:13:56,882
This is my quest

1119
01:13:56,946 --> 01:13:59,698
To follow that star

1120
01:13:59,762 --> 01:14:01,617
No matter how hopeless

1121
01:14:01,681 --> 01:14:04,497
No matter how far

1122
01:14:04,561 --> 01:14:06,897
To fight for the right

1123
01:14:06,961 --> 01:14:09,649
Without question or pause

1124
01:14:09,713 --> 01:14:11,857
To be willing
to march into hell

1125
01:14:11,921 --> 01:14:15,216
For a heavenly cause

1126
01:14:15,280 --> 01:14:19,856
And I know if I'll only be true

1127
01:14:19,920 --> 01:14:22,864
To this glorious quest

1128
01:14:22,928 --> 01:14:27,535
That my heart
will lie peaceful and calm

1129
01:14:27,599 --> 01:14:32,047
When I'm laid to my rest

1130
01:14:32,111 --> 01:14:37,614
And the world
will be better for this

1131
01:14:37,678 --> 01:14:42,894
That one man
scorned and covered with scars

1132
01:14:42,958 --> 01:14:48,973
Still strove
with his last ounce of courage

1133
01:14:49,037 --> 01:14:51,693
To reach

1134
01:14:51,757 --> 01:15:02,540
The unreachable star

1135
01:15:06,412 --> 01:15:10,603
Once, just once, would you
look at me as I really am?

1136
01:15:10,667 --> 01:15:14,539
I see beauty, purity.

1137
01:15:15,531 --> 01:15:17,291
Dulcinea.

1138
01:15:17,355 --> 01:15:21,034
You!
You keep me waiting, would you?

1139
01:15:21,098 --> 01:15:23,658
- I wasn't. I didn't mean to...
- Milady!

1140
01:15:23,722 --> 01:15:26,634
My little flower!

1141
01:15:26,698 --> 01:15:28,234
Monster!

1142
01:15:28,298 --> 01:15:29,674
Stay clear!

1143
01:15:29,738 --> 01:15:32,170
Thou wouldst strike a woman?

1144
01:15:32,234 --> 01:15:35,049
Ah, stand back,
or I'll break your head.

1145
01:15:35,113 --> 01:15:39,209
Thou heart of flint
and bowels of cork.

1146
01:15:45,768 --> 01:15:47,880
I'm killed.

1147
01:15:47,944 --> 01:15:49,480
Jose! Tenorio!

1148
01:15:49,480 --> 01:15:50,312
Jose! Tenorio!

1149
01:15:50,376 --> 01:15:53,352
- Pedro!
- Anselmo! Jose!

1150
01:15:53,416 --> 01:15:55,783
Muleteers!

1151
01:15:55,847 --> 01:15:57,191
Anselmo!

1152
01:15:58,951 --> 01:16:02,823
Tenorio! Anselmo! Muleteers!

1153
01:16:02,887 --> 01:16:04,615
Hold thou!

1154
01:16:04,679 --> 01:16:07,238
Heed the knocking
of thy craven knees!

1155
01:16:07,302 --> 01:16:08,838
Prepare to do battle!

1156
01:16:08,902 --> 01:16:11,878
Come one! Come all!

1157
01:16:13,638 --> 01:16:17,190
Come what may come!
Here am I!

1158
01:16:22,693 --> 01:16:24,965
Let him be.
He's worth a thousand of you!

1159
01:16:25,029 --> 01:16:27,205
Ahh, back, whore!
I'll show you!

1160
01:16:32,516 --> 01:16:33,828
Sancho!

1161
01:16:33,892 --> 01:16:35,012
Hold on, Your Grace!

1162
01:16:35,076 --> 01:16:36,964
Sancho!

1163
01:16:58,978 --> 01:17:00,834
Coming, Master!

1164
01:17:10,177 --> 01:17:11,905
Look out, Tenorio!

1165
01:17:14,785 --> 01:17:17,120
Help me! Help me! Help me!

1166
01:17:29,631 --> 01:17:31,167
Look out, Master! Look out!

1167
01:17:52,925 --> 01:17:54,141
Victory.

1168
01:17:54,205 --> 01:17:57,021
- Victory?
- Victory?

1169
01:17:57,085 --> 01:17:59,549
- Victory.
- Victory!

1170
01:17:59,613 --> 01:18:01,788
- Victory?
- Victory.

1171
01:18:01,852 --> 01:18:04,988
Victory! Victory!

1172
01:18:05,052 --> 01:18:05,148
What's this? All the noise?

1173
01:18:05,148 --> 01:18:07,900
What's this? All the noise?

1174
01:18:09,980 --> 01:18:12,923
- What dreadful thing?
- What glorious thing!

1175
01:18:12,987 --> 01:18:14,683
Don Castellano...

1176
01:18:14,747 --> 01:18:19,291
I would inform you
right has triumphed!

1177
01:18:19,355 --> 01:18:20,923
Your Grace, are you hurt?

1178
01:18:20,987 --> 01:18:26,138
No, no.
A little weakness... temporary.

1179
01:18:26,202 --> 01:18:27,354
Your Grace!

1180
01:18:27,418 --> 01:18:29,498
Bring water! Water, quick!

1181
01:18:32,250 --> 01:18:34,074
Oh, crusader.

1182
01:18:38,137 --> 01:18:40,345
Your Grace. Your Grace?

1183
01:18:42,233 --> 01:18:44,025
- He's coming round.
- Oh.

1184
01:18:45,081 --> 01:18:50,552
Oh, that I might always wake
unto such a vision.

1185
01:18:50,616 --> 01:18:51,704
Don't move.

1186
01:18:51,768 --> 01:18:55,320
I must say, Your Grace,
we certainly did a job out here.

1187
01:18:55,384 --> 01:18:56,472
We routed them.

1188
01:18:56,536 --> 01:18:59,159
That bunch will be
walking bow-legged for a week.

1189
01:18:59,223 --> 01:19:03,223
Milady, it is not seemly
to gloat over the fallen.

1190
01:19:03,287 --> 01:19:05,271
Let them rot in hell!

1191
01:19:06,295 --> 01:19:09,335
Sir, I am
a tame and peaceful man.

1192
01:19:09,399 --> 01:19:12,470
Please, Sir Knight, I do not
wish to be inhospitable...

1193
01:19:12,534 --> 01:19:15,798
but I must ask you to leave
as soon as you're able.

1194
01:19:15,862 --> 01:19:20,726
I am sorry to have offended
the dignity of your castle...

1195
01:19:20,790 --> 01:19:23,477
and at daylight,
I shall depart...

1196
01:19:23,541 --> 01:19:26,549
but first, may I remind you
of your promise?

1197
01:19:26,613 --> 01:19:27,989
Promise?

1198
01:19:28,053 --> 01:19:30,389
True, it is not yet dawn...

1199
01:19:30,453 --> 01:19:35,668
but I have kept vigil
and proven myself in combat.

1200
01:19:35,732 --> 01:19:39,988
I therefore beg you,
dub me knight.

1201
01:19:40,052 --> 01:19:43,540
Oh, certainly.
Let's get it over with.

1202
01:19:43,604 --> 01:19:47,379
Sancho, would you be
good enough to fetch my sword?

1203
01:19:47,443 --> 01:19:48,851
Yes, Your Grace.

1204
01:19:50,707 --> 01:19:52,595
I cannot speak, milady...

1205
01:19:52,659 --> 01:19:55,922
how joyful I am that this
ceremony should take place...

1206
01:19:55,986 --> 01:19:57,362
in your presence.

1207
01:19:57,426 --> 01:19:58,802
Be careful, now.

1208
01:19:58,866 --> 01:20:03,506
It is the solemn moment
that seals my vocation.

1209
01:20:03,570 --> 01:20:06,898
- Are you ready?
- I am.

1210
01:20:06,994 --> 01:20:09,777
Very well, then. Kneel.

1211
01:20:15,505 --> 01:20:18,161
Don Quixote de La Mancha...

1212
01:20:18,225 --> 01:20:21,040
I hereby dub thee knight.

1213
01:20:22,128 --> 01:20:23,184
My Lord.

1214
01:20:23,248 --> 01:20:25,552
Didn't I do it right?

1215
01:20:26,640 --> 01:20:29,456
If your lordship
could make some mention...

1216
01:20:29,520 --> 01:20:33,007
of the deeds I've performed
to deserve this honor...

1217
01:20:33,071 --> 01:20:35,247
Oh, of course.

1218
01:20:37,743 --> 01:20:40,303
Don Quixote de La Mancha...

1219
01:20:40,367 --> 01:20:42,222
having proved yourself
this day...

1220
01:20:42,286 --> 01:20:44,878
in glorious and terrible
combat...

1221
01:20:44,942 --> 01:20:48,206
and by my authority
as lord of this castle...

1222
01:20:48,270 --> 01:20:54,701
I hereby dub thee knight.

1223
01:20:55,821 --> 01:20:57,709
My Lord...

1224
01:20:57,805 --> 01:20:58,893
Something else?

1225
01:20:59,981 --> 01:21:01,261
If your lordship recalls...

1226
01:21:01,325 --> 01:21:04,397
it is the custom
to grant the new knight...

1227
01:21:04,460 --> 01:21:05,836
an additional name.

1228
01:21:05,900 --> 01:21:10,252
If your lordship
could devise such a name...

1229
01:21:11,820 --> 01:21:14,508
Uh, let me see.

1230
01:21:17,099 --> 01:21:18,475
Hail, Knight

1231
01:21:18,539 --> 01:21:20,907
Of the Woeful Countenance

1232
01:21:20,971 --> 01:21:24,491
Knight
of the Woeful Countenance

1233
01:21:24,555 --> 01:21:26,635
Wherever you go

1234
01:21:26,699 --> 01:21:28,234
People will know

1235
01:21:28,298 --> 01:21:30,282
Of the glorious deeds

1236
01:21:30,346 --> 01:21:34,058
Of the Knight
of the Woeful Countenance

1237
01:21:34,122 --> 01:21:36,042
Farewell and good cheer

1238
01:21:36,138 --> 01:21:38,058
Oh, my brave cavalier

1239
01:21:38,154 --> 01:21:41,993
Ride onward to glorious strife

1240
01:21:42,089 --> 01:21:43,977
I swear when you're gone

1241
01:21:44,073 --> 01:21:45,865
I'll remember you well

1242
01:21:45,929 --> 01:21:50,504
For all of the rest of my life

1243
01:21:50,568 --> 01:21:54,344
Hail, Knight
of the Woeful Countenance

1244
01:21:54,440 --> 01:21:57,384
Knight
of the Woeful Countenance

1245
01:21:57,448 --> 01:22:00,168
Wherever you go

1246
01:22:00,232 --> 01:22:01,608
Face to the foe

1247
01:22:01,672 --> 01:22:03,687
They will quail at the sight

1248
01:22:03,751 --> 01:22:07,623
Of the Knight
of the Woeful Countenance

1249
01:22:07,687 --> 01:22:09,095
Oh, valorous knight

1250
01:22:09,191 --> 01:22:11,527
Go and fight for the right

1251
01:22:11,591 --> 01:22:15,366
And battle the villains that be

1252
01:22:15,430 --> 01:22:16,966
But, oh, when you do

1253
01:22:17,030 --> 01:22:19,334
What will happen to you?

1254
01:22:19,398 --> 01:22:23,334
Thank God
I won't be there to see

1255
01:22:23,398 --> 01:22:24,933
Hail, Knight

1256
01:22:24,997 --> 01:22:26,981
- Of the Woeful Countenance
- Hail, Knight

1257
01:22:27,045 --> 01:22:28,869
- Of the Woeful Countenance
- Hail, Knight

1258
01:22:28,933 --> 01:22:31,301
Of the Woeful Countenance

1259
01:22:31,397 --> 01:22:33,285
Hail, Knight

1260
01:22:33,381 --> 01:22:37,412
Hail, Knight
of the Woeful Countenance

1261
01:22:37,476 --> 01:22:40,804
Knight
of the Woeful Countenance

1262
01:22:40,900 --> 01:22:43,268
Wherever you go

1263
01:22:43,364 --> 01:22:44,740
People will know

1264
01:22:44,804 --> 01:22:46,660
Of the glorious deeds

1265
01:22:46,724 --> 01:22:51,235
Of the Knight of the Woeful

1266
01:22:51,299 --> 01:22:55,459
Countenance

1267
01:22:55,523 --> 01:22:57,411
I thank you.

1268
01:22:57,507 --> 01:23:00,578
Well, Sir Knight,
I am going to bed.

1269
01:23:00,642 --> 01:23:03,490
And I advise you to do the same.

1270
01:23:07,362 --> 01:23:11,617
Knight
of the Woeful Countenance.

1271
01:23:11,681 --> 01:23:13,505
It's a beautiful name.

1272
01:23:13,569 --> 01:23:15,457
Come, Your Grace.
Let's get you to bed.

1273
01:23:15,521 --> 01:23:19,297
Not yet, Sancho.
I owe something to my enemies.

1274
01:23:19,361 --> 01:23:22,176
- That account's been paid.
- Not yet, milady.

1275
01:23:25,344 --> 01:23:28,288
- What?
- Nobility demands.

1276
01:23:28,352 --> 01:23:29,696
It does?

1277
01:23:29,760 --> 01:23:31,168
Yes.
Therefore I will go to them.

1278
01:23:31,232 --> 01:23:33,248
I'll go. I'll minister.

1279
01:23:33,312 --> 01:23:35,967
There is no need.

1280
01:23:37,375 --> 01:23:38,911
They were my enemies, too.

1281
01:23:44,479 --> 01:23:46,654
Oh, blessed one.

1282
01:23:46,718 --> 01:23:48,702
Come, Your Grace.
Let's get you to bed.

1283
01:23:48,766 --> 01:23:51,102
Sancho, I do envy my enemies.

1284
01:23:51,166 --> 01:23:52,542
Your Grace, you're tired.

1285
01:23:52,606 --> 01:23:54,942
No, Sancho, I feel quite well.

1286
01:23:55,006 --> 01:23:56,062
Your Grace, many a man...

1287
01:23:56,126 --> 01:23:58,173
has gone to bed in the evening
feeling well...

1288
01:23:58,237 --> 01:24:00,701
only to wake up in the morning
and find himself dead.

1289
01:24:00,765 --> 01:24:02,877
- That's a proverb.
- Yes, Your Grace.

1290
01:24:02,941 --> 01:24:04,893
- I don't approve of them.
- I know, Your Grace.

1291
01:24:10,076 --> 01:24:11,996
What in hell
do you think you're doing?

1292
01:24:12,092 --> 01:24:13,980
I'm going to minister
to your wounds.

1293
01:24:14,076 --> 01:24:17,020
- You're what?
- Nobility demands.

1294
01:24:18,812 --> 01:24:21,179
Turn over, you foxy goat!

1295
01:24:37,306 --> 01:24:38,650
You...

1296
01:25:02,616 --> 01:25:04,152
Sons of whores!

1297
01:25:04,216 --> 01:25:05,655
Let me out!

1298
01:25:14,135 --> 01:25:15,895
No!

1299
01:25:15,959 --> 01:25:17,110
Bastards!

1300
01:25:17,174 --> 01:25:19,766
Bastards! Bastards!

1301
01:25:19,830 --> 01:25:21,238
Bastards!

1302
01:25:28,629 --> 01:25:30,933
Ow! Bastards!

1303
01:25:30,997 --> 01:25:32,405
Bastards!

1304
01:25:34,357 --> 01:25:36,725
Let me go!

1305
01:25:38,581 --> 01:25:41,396
Let me go!

1306
01:25:45,172 --> 01:25:46,356
No!

1307
01:25:46,420 --> 01:25:47,668
Enough!

1308
01:25:53,139 --> 01:25:54,483
Load up. We're leaving.

1309
01:25:55,475 --> 01:25:56,819
What do we do with this?

1310
01:25:56,883 --> 01:25:59,379
We'll take it along.

1311
01:26:37,807 --> 01:26:42,063
Let these events be proof
to thee, my Sancho.

1312
01:26:42,127 --> 01:26:46,095
Nobility triumphs.
Virtue will always prevail.

1313
01:26:46,159 --> 01:26:47,823
Oh, yes, Your Grace.

1314
01:26:47,887 --> 01:26:51,182
Now, in this moment of glory...

1315
01:26:51,246 --> 01:26:54,542
do I confirm my knighthood
and my oath.

1316
01:26:54,606 --> 01:26:59,757
For all my life,
this I do swear.

1317
01:27:00,877 --> 01:27:06,381
To dream the impossible dream

1318
01:27:06,445 --> 01:27:12,300
To fight the unbeatable foe

1319
01:27:12,364 --> 01:27:17,900
To bear with unbearable sorrow

1320
01:27:17,964 --> 01:27:22,635
To run
where the brave dare not go

1321
01:27:30,571 --> 01:27:31,787
What is that?

1322
01:27:31,851 --> 01:27:34,090
One of the hazards
of this prison...

1323
01:27:34,154 --> 01:27:36,970
the brave men
of the Inquisition!

1324
01:27:37,034 --> 01:27:39,434
It means
they're coming to fetch someone.

1325
01:27:40,618 --> 01:27:43,754
Haul him off,
put the question to him.

1326
01:27:43,818 --> 01:27:46,313
Next thing he knows, he is dead.

1327
01:27:46,377 --> 01:27:49,417
They're coming for me
very possibly.

1328
01:27:49,481 --> 01:27:53,033
What, Cervantes, not afraid?
Where's your courage?

1329
01:27:53,097 --> 01:27:54,953
Or is that
in your imagination, too?

1330
01:27:55,017 --> 01:27:57,736
No escape. This is happening.

1331
01:27:57,800 --> 01:28:00,520
Not to your brave
man of La Mancha, but to you.

1332
01:28:00,584 --> 01:28:04,072
Quick, Cervantes, call on him.
Let him shield you.

1333
01:28:04,136 --> 01:28:08,551
Let him save you,
if he can... from that.

1334
01:28:56,611 --> 01:28:59,715
No! No! No! No!

1335
01:29:14,594 --> 01:29:16,993
Well, not this time.

1336
01:29:17,089 --> 01:29:18,945
But you see, Cervantes,
there is a difference...

1337
01:29:19,009 --> 01:29:20,929
between reality and illusion...

1338
01:29:21,025 --> 01:29:23,585
and a difference
between these prisoners...

1339
01:29:23,649 --> 01:29:25,313
and your men of lunacy.

1340
01:29:25,377 --> 01:29:29,184
I'd say rather men
whose illusions were very real.

1341
01:29:29,280 --> 01:29:31,648
Much the same thing,
isn't it, really?

1342
01:29:34,240 --> 01:29:37,632
Why are you poets
so fascinated with madmen?

1343
01:29:37,696 --> 01:29:39,392
We have much in common.

1344
01:29:39,456 --> 01:29:40,863
You both turn your backs
on life?

1345
01:29:40,959 --> 01:29:43,903
We both select from life!

1346
01:29:43,967 --> 01:29:47,039
A man has to come to terms
with life as it is.

1347
01:29:47,103 --> 01:29:49,471
Life as it is.

1348
01:29:49,535 --> 01:29:52,766
I have lived for over
forty years, and I've seen...

1349
01:29:54,462 --> 01:29:57,118
life as it is.

1350
01:29:59,806 --> 01:30:01,150
Pain...

1351
01:30:03,485 --> 01:30:04,701
misery...

1352
01:30:04,765 --> 01:30:06,045
cruelty beyond belief.

1353
01:30:06,109 --> 01:30:10,621
I've heard all the voices
of God's noblest creature.

1354
01:30:10,685 --> 01:30:14,588
Moans from bundles of filth
in the street.

1355
01:30:16,124 --> 01:30:19,100
I've been a soldier and a slave.

1356
01:30:20,828 --> 01:30:22,748
I've seen my comrades
fall in battle...

1357
01:30:22,844 --> 01:30:26,139
or die more slowly
under the lash in Africa.

1358
01:30:26,203 --> 01:30:28,059
I've held them
at the last moment.

1359
01:30:28,123 --> 01:30:32,859
These were men
who saw life as it is.

1360
01:30:32,923 --> 01:30:34,875
Yet they died despairing.

1361
01:30:36,283 --> 01:30:40,986
No glory, no brave last words.

1362
01:30:42,042 --> 01:30:46,810
Only their eyes,
filled with confusion...

1363
01:30:46,906 --> 01:30:49,401
questioning why.

1364
01:30:49,465 --> 01:30:54,105
I do not think they were
asking why they were dying...

1365
01:30:54,169 --> 01:30:58,521
but why they had ever lived.

1366
01:31:00,280 --> 01:31:05,016
When life itself seems lunatic,
who knows where madness lies?

1367
01:31:05,080 --> 01:31:07,416
Perhaps to be too practical
is madness.

1368
01:31:07,480 --> 01:31:09,336
To surrender dreams,
this may be madness.

1369
01:31:09,400 --> 01:31:11,575
To seek treasure
where there is only trash...

1370
01:31:11,639 --> 01:31:14,455
too much sanity may be madness!

1371
01:31:14,519 --> 01:31:16,919
And maddest of all...

1372
01:31:17,015 --> 01:31:21,271
to see life as it is
and not as it should be!

1373
01:31:21,335 --> 01:31:23,734
I am I, Don Quixote

1374
01:31:23,830 --> 01:31:26,166
The Lord of La Mancha

1375
01:31:26,230 --> 01:31:30,486
Destroyer of evil am I

1376
01:31:30,550 --> 01:31:33,142
I will march to the sound

1377
01:31:33,206 --> 01:31:35,765
Of the trumpets of glory

1378
01:31:35,829 --> 01:31:40,149
Forever to conquer or die

1379
01:31:42,549 --> 01:31:43,925
I don't understand.

1380
01:31:43,989 --> 01:31:45,876
Don't understand what,
my friend?

1381
01:31:45,972 --> 01:31:47,380
Why you're so cheerful.

1382
01:31:47,444 --> 01:31:49,780
First you find your lady,
then you lose her.

1383
01:31:49,844 --> 01:31:50,900
Never lost.

1384
01:31:50,964 --> 01:31:52,820
Well, she ran off
with those muleteers.

1385
01:31:52,884 --> 01:31:55,220
Doubtless for some high purpose.

1386
01:31:55,284 --> 01:31:57,363
High purpose
with those low characters?

1387
01:31:57,427 --> 01:32:01,683
Sancho, always thine eye sees
evil in preference to good.

1388
01:32:01,747 --> 01:32:05,363
My eye did not make this world.
It only sees it.

1389
01:32:05,427 --> 01:32:07,923
Right, and furthermore,
I think you should call a truce.

1390
01:32:07,987 --> 01:32:10,674
What, and allow wickedness
to flourish?

1391
01:32:10,738 --> 01:32:13,554
I've noticed wickedness
wears pretty thick armor.

1392
01:32:13,618 --> 01:32:15,506
And for that
would you have me cease?

1393
01:32:15,570 --> 01:32:18,450
Nay, let a man be struck down
a thousand times!

1394
01:32:18,546 --> 01:32:20,593
- Still must he rise and...
- Do battle, yes.

1395
01:32:20,657 --> 01:32:23,153
Lies, lies, lies!
Madness and lies!

1396
01:32:23,153 --> 01:32:24,849
Lies, lies, lies!
Madness and lies!

1397
01:32:36,368 --> 01:32:40,368
They shall be punished,
who did this crime.

1398
01:32:40,432 --> 01:32:42,704
Crime?

1399
01:32:42,768 --> 01:32:46,063
You know the worst crime
of all? Being born.

1400
01:32:46,159 --> 01:32:48,687
For that you get punished
your whole life.

1401
01:32:48,751 --> 01:32:51,951
- Dulcinea.
- Enough of that!

1402
01:32:52,015 --> 01:32:53,839
Get yourself to a madhouse!

1403
01:32:53,903 --> 01:32:56,238
Rave about nobility
where no one can hear.

1404
01:32:56,302 --> 01:32:59,598
- Milady.
- I'm not your lady!

1405
01:32:59,694 --> 01:33:02,990
I'm not any kind of a lady.

1406
01:33:03,086 --> 01:33:08,301
For a lady
has modest and maidenly airs

1407
01:33:08,365 --> 01:33:13,133
And a virtue a blind man
could see that I lack

1408
01:33:13,229 --> 01:33:15,917
It's hard to develop

1409
01:33:15,981 --> 01:33:18,348
These maidenly airs

1410
01:33:18,412 --> 01:33:22,124
In a stable,
laid flat on your back

1411
01:33:23,308 --> 01:33:26,124
Won't you look at me,
look at me

1412
01:33:26,188 --> 01:33:29,003
God, won't you look at me?

1413
01:33:29,067 --> 01:33:31,371
Look at the kitchen slut

1414
01:33:31,435 --> 01:33:34,059
Reeking of sweat

1415
01:33:34,123 --> 01:33:36,427
Born on a dung heap

1416
01:33:36,491 --> 01:33:38,955
To die on a dung heap

1417
01:33:39,019 --> 01:33:42,826
A strumpet men use and forget

1418
01:33:44,330 --> 01:33:46,410
If you feel that you see me

1419
01:33:46,474 --> 01:33:51,658
Not quite at my virginal best

1420
01:33:51,722 --> 01:33:54,313
Cross my palm with a coin

1421
01:33:54,377 --> 01:33:58,633
And I'll willingly
show you the rest

1422
01:33:58,697 --> 01:34:01,641
Never deny
that you are Dulcinea.

1423
01:34:01,705 --> 01:34:04,904
Take the clouds from your eyes
and see me as I really am!

1424
01:34:04,968 --> 01:34:06,984
You have shown me the sky

1425
01:34:07,048 --> 01:34:09,832
But what good is the sky

1426
01:34:09,896 --> 01:34:14,887
To a creature who'll never
do better than crawl?

1427
01:34:14,951 --> 01:34:17,735
Of all the cruel bastards

1428
01:34:17,799 --> 01:34:21,031
Who've badgered and battered me

1429
01:34:21,095 --> 01:34:24,295
You are the cruelest of all

1430
01:34:25,319 --> 01:34:30,822
Can't you see what your gentle
insanities do to me?

1431
01:34:30,886 --> 01:34:35,686
Rob me of anger
and give me despair

1432
01:34:35,782 --> 01:34:39,141
Blows and abuse I can take

1433
01:34:39,237 --> 01:34:41,093
And give back again

1434
01:34:41,157 --> 01:34:45,221
Tenderness I cannot bear

1435
01:34:45,285 --> 01:34:48,389
So please torture me now

1436
01:34:48,453 --> 01:34:53,252
With your sweet Dulcineas
no more

1437
01:34:53,348 --> 01:34:56,100
I am no one, I am nothing

1438
01:34:56,164 --> 01:35:00,483
I'm only Aldonza the whore

1439
01:35:00,579 --> 01:35:04,835
Now and forever
you are milady, Dulcinea.

1440
01:35:04,899 --> 01:35:07,491
No!

1441
01:35:20,066 --> 01:35:23,362
Master.

1442
01:35:23,457 --> 01:35:25,313
Master!

1443
01:36:02,238 --> 01:36:05,246
Is this
Don Quixote de La Mancha?

1444
01:36:05,310 --> 01:36:08,350
If it is, and he is not afraid
to look upon me...

1445
01:36:08,414 --> 01:36:10,973
let him stand forth.

1446
01:36:16,317 --> 01:36:19,261
I am Don Quixote...

1447
01:36:19,325 --> 01:36:21,948
Knight
of the Woeful Countenance.

1448
01:36:22,012 --> 01:36:24,508
Then hear me, thou charlatan.

1449
01:36:24,572 --> 01:36:28,284
Thou art no knight,
but a foolish pretender.

1450
01:36:28,348 --> 01:36:31,260
Thy pretense
is a child's mockery...

1451
01:36:31,356 --> 01:36:34,939
and thy principles
dirt beneath my feet.

1452
01:36:35,003 --> 01:36:38,331
False, graceless knight...

1453
01:36:38,427 --> 01:36:42,235
before I chastise thee,
tell me thy name.

1454
01:36:42,331 --> 01:36:44,730
Thou shalt hear it
in due course.

1455
01:36:44,826 --> 01:36:47,098
And why seekest thou me?

1456
01:36:47,162 --> 01:36:50,170
Thou called upon me,
Don Quixote.

1457
01:36:50,234 --> 01:36:53,850
Thou reviled me
and threatened me.

1458
01:36:55,577 --> 01:36:57,209
The Enchanter.

1459
01:37:00,569 --> 01:37:05,337
Behold at thy feet
the gauge of battle.

1460
01:37:16,568 --> 01:37:18,423
On what terms do we fight?

1461
01:37:18,487 --> 01:37:20,279
Choose.

1462
01:37:20,343 --> 01:37:24,983
Very well. If thou art beaten,
thy freedom is forfeit...

1463
01:37:25,047 --> 01:37:27,831
and thou must obey
my every command.

1464
01:37:28,823 --> 01:37:30,038
And thy conditions?

1465
01:37:30,102 --> 01:37:32,438
If thou livest...

1466
01:37:32,502 --> 01:37:36,854
thou shalt kneel and beg
forgiveness of milady, Dulcinea.

1467
01:37:36,918 --> 01:37:40,598
Ha!
Thy lady is an alley cat.

1468
01:37:40,662 --> 01:37:44,693
- Monster! Defend thyself!
- Halt.

1469
01:37:44,757 --> 01:37:47,253
Thou asked my name, Don Quixote.

1470
01:37:47,317 --> 01:37:49,717
Now I shall tell it.

1471
01:37:49,813 --> 01:37:53,588
I am called
the Knight of the Mirrors.

1472
01:37:57,268 --> 01:38:00,788
Look, Don Quixote.
Look in the mirror of reality...

1473
01:38:00,852 --> 01:38:03,284
and behold things
as they truly are.

1474
01:38:04,755 --> 01:38:07,475
Look, Don Quixote.

1475
01:38:09,267 --> 01:38:13,523
Look in the mirror of reality.

1476
01:38:13,619 --> 01:38:15,890
Look!
What seest thou, Don Quixote?

1477
01:38:15,954 --> 01:38:20,402
A gallant knight?
Naught but an aging fool.

1478
01:38:20,466 --> 01:38:21,842
Look, dost thou see him?

1479
01:38:21,906 --> 01:38:24,658
A madman
dressed for a masquerade.

1480
01:38:24,722 --> 01:38:26,322
A masquerade!

1481
01:38:26,386 --> 01:38:29,841
Look, Don Quixote.
See him as he truly is.

1482
01:38:29,905 --> 01:38:30,929
See the clown.

1483
01:38:31,025 --> 01:38:33,489
Look, what seest thou,
Don Quixote?

1484
01:38:33,553 --> 01:38:36,529
Look! Dost thou see him?

1485
01:38:36,593 --> 01:38:40,048
A madman! Look, Don Quixote!

1486
01:38:40,112 --> 01:38:42,224
See him as he truly is.

1487
01:38:42,288 --> 01:38:44,656
Look, Don Quixote.

1488
01:38:44,720 --> 01:38:46,576
Drown, Don Quixote.

1489
01:38:46,640 --> 01:38:49,296
Drown in the mirror.

1490
01:38:49,360 --> 01:38:53,295
Drown, Don Quixote.
Drown in the mirror.

1491
01:38:53,359 --> 01:38:57,039
Go deep. Deep. Deep.

1492
01:38:57,103 --> 01:39:01,646
Deep. Go deep. Deep.

1493
01:39:01,710 --> 01:39:03,918
The masquerade is ended.

1494
01:39:03,982 --> 01:39:08,014
Confess!
Thy lady is a trollop...

1495
01:39:08,078 --> 01:39:12,845
and thy dream the nightmare
of a disordered mind.

1496
01:39:21,357 --> 01:39:22,989
It is done.

1497
01:39:23,053 --> 01:39:26,124
Your Grace, it is Dr. Carrasco.

1498
01:39:26,188 --> 01:39:28,364
It is only Sanson Carrasco.

1499
01:39:31,276 --> 01:39:35,276
Forgive me, Señor Quijana.
It was the only way.

1500
01:39:40,651 --> 01:39:44,235
Don Miguel de Cervantes?

1501
01:39:44,299 --> 01:39:47,082
Who calls?

1502
01:39:50,058 --> 01:39:51,498
Don Miguel.

1503
01:40:02,057 --> 01:40:05,513
Cervantes! Cervantes!

1504
01:40:05,577 --> 01:40:08,649
Don Miguel de Cervantes!

1505
01:40:08,713 --> 01:40:11,272
Don Miguel de Cervantes!

1506
01:40:11,336 --> 01:40:13,576
Prepare to be summoned.

1507
01:40:13,640 --> 01:40:15,784
Summoned? By whom?

1508
01:40:15,848 --> 01:40:18,568
The judges of the Inquisition.

1509
01:40:18,632 --> 01:40:22,151
Captain? How long?

1510
01:40:22,215 --> 01:40:23,783
Soon.

1511
01:40:25,415 --> 01:40:27,623
But not yet. Good.

1512
01:40:27,687 --> 01:40:30,247
You'll just have time
to finish your story.

1513
01:40:30,311 --> 01:40:33,926
The story is finished.

1514
01:40:33,990 --> 01:40:36,806
Of course.
Quite the proper ending.

1515
01:40:36,870 --> 01:40:37,958
No, no, no!

1516
01:40:38,022 --> 01:40:39,878
I don't like this ending!

1517
01:40:39,942 --> 01:40:42,182
And I don't think
the jury likes it, either.

1518
01:40:42,246 --> 01:40:44,197
Well, then. He's failed.

1519
01:40:44,293 --> 01:40:49,061
Ah, Don Miguel de Cervantes.

1520
01:40:49,157 --> 01:40:50,501
The court
hereby sentences you...

1521
01:40:50,565 --> 01:40:51,973
- Wait!
- What for?

1522
01:40:52,069 --> 01:40:54,885
- Time. I need time.
- I'll grant you that.

1523
01:40:54,949 --> 01:40:58,148
But, uh, what about
the Inquisition?

1524
01:40:58,212 --> 01:41:02,500
A few moments only.
I'll improvise an ending.

1525
01:41:02,596 --> 01:41:07,203
A farmhouse
on the plains of La Mancha.

1526
01:41:07,267 --> 01:41:09,059
Candle.

1527
01:41:09,123 --> 01:41:11,587
A room in that house.

1528
01:41:11,651 --> 01:41:15,363
When a man who once called
himself Don Quixote...

1529
01:41:15,427 --> 01:41:21,986
lies in the shadows
between living and dying.

1530
01:41:41,472 --> 01:41:43,136
Can you do nothing?

1531
01:41:43,200 --> 01:41:47,232
I'm afraid there will be no
need of my services as a doctor.

1532
01:41:52,416 --> 01:41:54,655
Where is he, I wonder?

1533
01:41:54,719 --> 01:41:58,431
In what dark cavern
of the mind?

1534
01:41:58,495 --> 01:42:02,751
- According to recent theory...
- Oh, Doctor, please.

1535
01:42:02,815 --> 01:42:05,150
Don't you think I did right?

1536
01:42:05,214 --> 01:42:07,102
There's the contradiction.

1537
01:42:09,278 --> 01:42:10,750
You again!

1538
01:42:10,846 --> 01:42:13,566
- Tell him to go away.
- What harm can he do?

1539
01:42:13,630 --> 01:42:14,878
It's all been done.

1540
01:42:14,942 --> 01:42:17,789
Your reverence?
Could I talk to him?

1541
01:42:17,885 --> 01:42:20,061
I'm afraid
he won't be able to hear you.

1542
01:42:20,125 --> 01:42:21,533
Well, then, I won't say much.

1543
01:42:25,469 --> 01:42:27,868
No mention of knight-errantry.

1544
01:42:27,964 --> 01:42:31,164
Oh, no. One does not speak
of the rope...

1545
01:42:31,228 --> 01:42:33,564
in the house of the hanged.

1546
01:42:33,628 --> 01:42:36,476
Proverb. Excuse me, Your Grace.

1547
01:42:36,572 --> 01:42:39,483
- Your Grace?
- Just a few words.

1548
01:42:39,579 --> 01:42:43,035
Little ones...
to lighten his heart.

1549
01:42:43,099 --> 01:42:46,555
A little gossip

1550
01:42:46,619 --> 01:42:48,475
A little chat

1551
01:42:48,539 --> 01:42:52,666
A little idle talk
of this and that

1552
01:42:52,730 --> 01:42:55,930
I'll tell him
all the troubles I have had

1553
01:42:55,994 --> 01:42:58,394
And since he doesn't hear

1554
01:42:58,490 --> 01:43:00,538
At least he won't feel bad

1555
01:43:00,602 --> 01:43:02,009
Shh, shh.

1556
01:43:02,073 --> 01:43:05,369
I'm sorry. I'm sorry.

1557
01:43:07,001 --> 01:43:09,337
Oh, what a time
I've been having...

1558
01:43:09,401 --> 01:43:11,193
since I got back, Your Grace.

1559
01:43:11,257 --> 01:43:13,656
You know my wife Teresa,
how strong she is...

1560
01:43:13,752 --> 01:43:14,968
muscles like a bull.

1561
01:43:15,032 --> 01:43:16,632
Well, she beat me.

1562
01:43:16,696 --> 01:43:19,672
She hit me with everything
but the house itself.

1563
01:43:19,736 --> 01:43:21,176
And she yells at me...

1564
01:43:21,272 --> 01:43:23,576
"Where's all the gold
and all the jewels...

1565
01:43:23,640 --> 01:43:24,823
"you were going to bring back?

1566
01:43:24,887 --> 01:43:27,927
"Where's that kingdom
you were going to conquer?"

1567
01:43:27,991 --> 01:43:30,775
Well, I kept a dignified
silence, Your Grace...

1568
01:43:30,839 --> 01:43:33,815
because there are some
questions you just can't answer.

1569
01:43:33,879 --> 01:43:37,654
Like when a man yells, "What
are you doing with my wife?"

1570
01:43:37,718 --> 01:43:41,974
That's a question
you just can't answer.

1571
01:43:42,038 --> 01:43:43,734
Of course, I hit her back,
Your Grace.

1572
01:43:43,798 --> 01:43:46,518
But she's a lot harder
than I am...

1573
01:43:46,582 --> 01:43:48,565
and as the saying goes...

1574
01:43:48,661 --> 01:43:50,869
"Whether the stone
hits the pitcher...

1575
01:43:50,933 --> 01:43:52,085
"or the pitcher
hits the stone...

1576
01:43:52,149 --> 01:43:55,381
"it's going to be bad
for the pitcher."

1577
01:43:55,445 --> 01:43:59,124
So I've got bruises
from here to...

1578
01:44:10,419 --> 01:44:17,619
Oh, I haven't fought
a windmill in a fortnight

1579
01:44:17,715 --> 01:44:21,746
And the humble joys
get duller every day

1580
01:44:21,810 --> 01:44:26,834
Why, when I'm asleep, a dragon
with his fiery tongue a-waggin'

1581
01:44:26,898 --> 01:44:31,570
Whispers, Sancho, won't you
please come out and play?

1582
01:44:31,634 --> 01:44:32,690
That's enough!

1583
01:44:32,754 --> 01:44:33,777
- What did I do?
- I warned you.

1584
01:44:33,873 --> 01:44:37,041
- I didn't do anything. I was...
- Please be quiet.

1585
01:44:40,401 --> 01:44:42,769
My friend?

1586
01:44:42,833 --> 01:44:45,520
Did Your Grace say something?

1587
01:44:49,264 --> 01:44:53,072
You are a fat pudding...

1588
01:44:53,168 --> 01:44:55,440
stuffed with proverbs.

1589
01:44:55,504 --> 01:45:00,143
Oh, that's very well-known,
Your Grace.

1590
01:45:00,207 --> 01:45:02,031
Well, as I was saying...

1591
01:45:02,095 --> 01:45:05,551
- Uncle?
- My dear.

1592
01:45:11,854 --> 01:45:14,734
Good morning, Father.

1593
01:45:14,830 --> 01:45:16,654
Or is it evening?

1594
01:45:18,318 --> 01:45:19,917
How do you feel, sir?

1595
01:45:22,605 --> 01:45:24,973
I am but well.

1596
01:45:25,037 --> 01:45:27,373
Can you speak your name?

1597
01:45:27,437 --> 01:45:29,805
Should a man not know his name?

1598
01:45:29,869 --> 01:45:33,164
If you would just say it.

1599
01:45:33,228 --> 01:45:35,756
Alonso Quijana.

1600
01:45:40,716 --> 01:45:42,603
Father?

1601
01:45:42,699 --> 01:45:46,283
I am here, beside you.

1602
01:45:46,347 --> 01:45:49,643
I wish to make a will.

1603
01:45:49,739 --> 01:45:53,386
Yes.

1604
01:45:53,450 --> 01:45:54,634
Of course.

1605
01:45:57,834 --> 01:46:00,426
- Uncle?
- Forgive me.

1606
01:46:00,490 --> 01:46:05,737
L... When I close my eyes,
I see a pale horse...

1607
01:46:05,833 --> 01:46:08,169
and I am bid mount him.

1608
01:46:08,233 --> 01:46:10,185
No, uncle, you will get well.

1609
01:46:10,281 --> 01:46:13,513
Oh, my dear master's worship,
do not die...

1610
01:46:13,577 --> 01:46:15,305
but live on many years.

1611
01:46:15,369 --> 01:46:17,896
Dying is such a waste
of good health.

1612
01:46:17,960 --> 01:46:22,600
Soft and fair, my dear ones.

1613
01:46:22,664 --> 01:46:27,016
In last year's nests,
there are no birds this year.

1614
01:46:27,112 --> 01:46:28,999
Come closer.

1615
01:46:33,543 --> 01:46:38,535
I have dreamed so strangely.

1616
01:46:38,599 --> 01:46:42,470
Oh, such dreams.

1617
01:46:42,566 --> 01:46:50,150
I... thought
I had declared myself a...

1618
01:46:52,997 --> 01:46:58,053
No, I dare not tell you,
lest you think me mad.

1619
01:46:58,117 --> 01:47:02,468
- Put them from your mind.
- They are gone.

1620
01:47:02,564 --> 01:47:06,116
Nor do I know what they meant.

1621
01:47:07,908 --> 01:47:09,060
Father?

1622
01:47:10,436 --> 01:47:14,563
Just speak, and I shall write.

1623
01:47:16,899 --> 01:47:22,019
I, Alonso Quijana...

1624
01:47:22,083 --> 01:47:24,451
with one foot in the stirrup...

1625
01:47:24,515 --> 01:47:27,842
and all too ready
for the final ride...

1626
01:47:28,930 --> 01:47:30,306
Don't admit anyone.

1627
01:47:30,370 --> 01:47:36,385
Do hereby make the following
disposition of my estate.

1628
01:47:37,953 --> 01:47:43,969
The bulk I leave to my beloved
niece Antonia Quijana...

1629
01:47:44,033 --> 01:47:48,224
with the exception
of certain personal bequests...

1630
01:47:48,288 --> 01:47:49,696
which are as follows...

1631
01:47:49,792 --> 01:47:52,640
I will allow nobody
into that room!

1632
01:47:52,736 --> 01:47:54,400
Get out of the way, you hag!

1633
01:47:54,464 --> 01:47:57,728
- What is that, Sanson?
- It's that slut from the inn.

1634
01:47:59,295 --> 01:48:01,855
I tried to stop her,
and she threatened to...

1635
01:48:01,919 --> 01:48:05,055
Tear your eyes out
if you touch me again, by God!

1636
01:48:05,119 --> 01:48:07,231
- Get out!
- Not before I see him!

1637
01:48:07,295 --> 01:48:09,087
Let her be.

1638
01:48:09,151 --> 01:48:13,278
In my house
there will be courtesy!

1639
01:48:19,006 --> 01:48:20,798
Come closer, girl.

1640
01:48:30,781 --> 01:48:33,309
What is it you wish?

1641
01:48:34,332 --> 01:48:36,124
Don't you know me?

1642
01:48:38,140 --> 01:48:39,356
Should I?

1643
01:48:41,404 --> 01:48:43,164
I am Aldonza.

1644
01:48:43,228 --> 01:48:48,379
I'm so sorry. L... I don't recall
anyone of that name.

1645
01:48:48,443 --> 01:48:50,395
Oh, please, My Lord.

1646
01:48:50,491 --> 01:48:52,987
Why do you say, "My Lord"?

1647
01:48:53,051 --> 01:48:55,899
You are My Lord, Don Quixote.

1648
01:48:57,178 --> 01:48:59,962
Don Quixote?

1649
01:49:03,258 --> 01:49:08,153
Forgive me.
I am confused by shadows.

1650
01:49:08,217 --> 01:49:12,889
It is possible I knew you once.
I do not remember.

1651
01:49:17,465 --> 01:49:18,553
This way.

1652
01:49:19,672 --> 01:49:20,952
Please try to remember.

1653
01:49:23,192 --> 01:49:26,200
Is it so important?

1654
01:49:26,264 --> 01:49:28,600
Everything.

1655
01:49:28,664 --> 01:49:30,776
My whole life.

1656
01:49:30,840 --> 01:49:33,367
You spoke to me.

1657
01:49:33,431 --> 01:49:37,143
And everything was... different.

1658
01:49:37,207 --> 01:49:39,895
I spoke to you?

1659
01:49:39,959 --> 01:49:42,774
And you looked at me...

1660
01:49:42,838 --> 01:49:46,518
and you called me
by another name.

1661
01:49:46,582 --> 01:49:48,310
Dulcinea.

1662
01:49:50,646 --> 01:49:53,590
Dulcinea

1663
01:49:55,477 --> 01:49:57,365
Once you found a girl

1664
01:49:57,429 --> 01:49:58,869
And called her

1665
01:49:58,965 --> 01:50:02,517
Dulcinea

1666
01:50:03,829 --> 01:50:06,612
When you spoke the name

1667
01:50:06,676 --> 01:50:12,372
An angel seemed to whisper

1668
01:50:12,436 --> 01:50:16,755
Dulcinea

1669
01:50:19,379 --> 01:50:21,491
Dulcinea

1670
01:50:31,730 --> 01:50:36,082
Then perhaps it was not a dream.

1671
01:50:36,178 --> 01:50:38,546
You spoke of a dream...

1672
01:50:38,610 --> 01:50:40,017
and about the quest.

1673
01:50:40,113 --> 01:50:42,097
A quest?

1674
01:50:42,193 --> 01:50:44,081
How you must fight?

1675
01:50:44,145 --> 01:50:47,313
And it doesn't matter
whether you win or lose...

1676
01:50:47,377 --> 01:50:51,152
if only you follow the quest.

1677
01:50:51,216 --> 01:50:54,544
What did I say to you?

1678
01:50:54,640 --> 01:50:56,240
Tell me the words.

1679
01:50:56,304 --> 01:51:00,560
"To dream...

1680
01:51:00,624 --> 01:51:03,247
"the impossible dream."

1681
01:51:05,295 --> 01:51:07,183
But they are your own words.

1682
01:51:07,247 --> 01:51:10,127
"To fight...

1683
01:51:10,223 --> 01:51:13,039
"the unbeatable foe."

1684
01:51:13,103 --> 01:51:14,734
Don't you remember?

1685
01:51:14,798 --> 01:51:17,646
"To bear...

1686
01:51:17,710 --> 01:51:21,102
"with unbearable sorrow."

1687
01:51:21,198 --> 01:51:23,086
You must remember!

1688
01:51:26,637 --> 01:51:29,421
"To run...

1689
01:51:29,485 --> 01:51:32,301
"where the brave dare not go."

1690
01:51:35,853 --> 01:51:37,932
To right...

1691
01:51:37,996 --> 01:51:41,036
the unrightable wrong.

1692
01:51:41,100 --> 01:51:42,860
Yes.

1693
01:51:45,548 --> 01:51:47,244
To love...

1694
01:51:47,308 --> 01:51:50,443
pure and chaste from afar.

1695
01:51:50,507 --> 01:51:52,139
Yes.

1696
01:51:52,203 --> 01:51:57,291
To try
when your arms are too weary.

1697
01:51:58,923 --> 01:52:03,498
To reach the unreachable star.

1698
01:52:03,562 --> 01:52:06,602
Thank you, My Lord.

1699
01:52:09,578 --> 01:52:12,297
Milady! This is not seemly.

1700
01:52:12,361 --> 01:52:13,769
On your knees to me?

1701
01:52:13,865 --> 01:52:16,681
- But, My Lord, you're not well.
- Not well?

1702
01:52:16,745 --> 01:52:20,073
What is sickness
to the body of a knight-errant?

1703
01:52:20,169 --> 01:52:23,624
What matter wounds?
For each time he falls...

1704
01:52:23,688 --> 01:52:27,848
he will rise again...
and woe to the wicked!

1705
01:52:27,912 --> 01:52:30,600
- Sancho?
- Here, Your Grace!

1706
01:52:30,664 --> 01:52:33,928
- My armor, my sword!
- More misadventures!

1707
01:52:33,992 --> 01:52:36,775
Adventures, old friend!

1708
01:52:36,839 --> 01:52:39,463
Oh, the trumpets of glory

1709
01:52:39,527 --> 01:52:41,639
Now call me to rise

1710
01:52:41,703 --> 01:52:46,438
Yes, the trumpets
are calling to me

1711
01:52:46,502 --> 01:52:48,646
And wherever I ride

1712
01:52:48,710 --> 01:52:51,526
Ever staunch at my side

1713
01:52:51,590 --> 01:52:56,326
My squire and my lady will be

1714
01:52:56,390 --> 01:52:59,109
I am I, Don Quixote

1715
01:52:59,173 --> 01:53:01,317
The Lord of La Mancha

1716
01:53:01,381 --> 01:53:05,541
Our destiny calls, and we go

1717
01:53:05,605 --> 01:53:08,325
And the wild winds of fortune

1718
01:53:08,389 --> 01:53:10,820
Will carry us onward

1719
01:53:10,916 --> 01:53:16,324
Whithersoever they blow

1720
01:53:16,388 --> 01:53:21,123
Whithersoever they blow

1721
01:53:21,219 --> 01:53:25,187
Onward to glory we go

1722
01:53:26,179 --> 01:53:28,579
Master!

1723
01:53:28,675 --> 01:53:30,467
- Master!
- Uncle!

1724
01:53:31,874 --> 01:53:33,154
Master.

1725
01:53:33,218 --> 01:53:35,170
My Lord.

1726
01:54:07,519 --> 01:54:16,095
De profundis clamo ad te

1727
01:54:16,191 --> 01:54:19,966
Domine

1728
01:54:20,030 --> 01:54:24,062
Domine

1729
01:54:24,126 --> 01:54:31,773
Audi vocem meam

1730
01:54:31,869 --> 01:54:39,901
Fiant aures tuae intentae

1731
01:54:39,965 --> 01:54:51,707
Ad vocem abse creationis meae

1732
01:54:51,771 --> 01:55:01,083
Si delictarum memorium

1733
01:55:01,147 --> 01:55:05,530
Serva neris

1734
01:55:08,954 --> 01:55:13,018
Domine

1735
01:55:13,082 --> 01:55:17,209
Domine...

1736
01:55:27,128 --> 01:55:29,976
He is dead.

1737
01:55:30,072 --> 01:55:33,432
My master is dead.

1738
01:55:33,528 --> 01:55:36,216
A man died.

1739
01:55:36,280 --> 01:55:39,575
He seemed a good man...

1740
01:55:39,671 --> 01:55:41,783
but I did not know him.

1741
01:55:43,607 --> 01:55:46,327
But you saw.

1742
01:55:46,391 --> 01:55:48,982
Don Quixote's not dead.

1743
01:55:49,046 --> 01:55:50,998
Believe, Sancho.

1744
01:55:51,094 --> 01:55:53,462
Believe.

1745
01:55:53,558 --> 01:55:55,542
Aldonza...

1746
01:55:59,158 --> 01:56:00,533
Dulcinea.

1747
01:56:05,109 --> 01:56:06,869
Dulcinea.

1748
01:57:10,351 --> 01:57:13,199
Under authority of the Holy
Office of the Inquisition...

1749
01:57:13,263 --> 01:57:15,119
by reason of certain offenses...

1750
01:57:15,183 --> 01:57:17,935
committed against His Majesty's
Most Catholic Church...

1751
01:57:17,999 --> 01:57:21,134
the following is summoned
to give answer...

1752
01:57:21,198 --> 01:57:23,438
and submit his person
for purification...

1753
01:57:23,502 --> 01:57:24,974
if it be so ordered...

1754
01:57:25,070 --> 01:57:28,398
Don Miguel de Cervantes.

1755
01:57:33,069 --> 01:57:36,941
I am a popular defendant.

1756
01:57:37,037 --> 01:57:39,181
Summoned before one court...

1757
01:57:39,245 --> 01:57:41,389
before I've quite finished
with another.

1758
01:57:42,893 --> 01:57:47,340
Well, what says this jury?

1759
01:57:58,891 --> 01:58:04,171
You know, I think I know now
what this contains.

1760
01:58:08,938 --> 01:58:12,138
The history of your mad knight.

1761
01:58:14,890 --> 01:58:17,418
As much as is written.

1762
01:58:17,482 --> 01:58:22,057
Read as well there
as you did here...

1763
01:58:22,121 --> 01:58:23,401
and you may not burn.

1764
01:58:25,609 --> 01:58:28,489
I have no intention of burning.

1765
01:58:32,488 --> 01:58:35,560
Cervantes?

1766
01:58:35,624 --> 01:58:38,760
I think Don Quixote...

1767
01:58:38,824 --> 01:58:41,671
is brother to Cervantes.

1768
01:58:46,311 --> 01:58:50,567
God help us.
We are both men of La Mancha.

1769
01:58:58,918 --> 01:59:03,909
For me alone
was Don Quixote born...

1770
01:59:03,973 --> 01:59:06,341
and I for him.

1771
01:59:09,605 --> 01:59:12,261
I give him to you.

1772
01:59:16,484 --> 01:59:18,212
Ready, old friend?

1773
01:59:28,387 --> 01:59:29,443
Courage.

1774
02:00:02,688 --> 02:00:07,584
To dream the impossible dream...

1775
02:00:07,648 --> 02:00:12,959
to fight the unbeatable foe.

1776
02:00:13,055 --> 02:00:18,303
To bear with unbearable sorrow

1777
02:00:18,399 --> 02:00:24,958
To run
where the brave dare not go

1778
02:00:25,022 --> 02:00:31,198
To run
where the brave dare not go

1779
02:00:31,294 --> 02:00:36,861
Though the goal
be forever too far

1780
02:00:36,925 --> 02:00:42,909
To try
though you're wayworn and weary

1781
02:00:42,973 --> 02:00:48,444
To reach the unreachable star

1782
02:00:48,508 --> 02:00:55,612
To reach the unreachable star

1783
02:00:55,676 --> 02:01:01,371
Though you know
it's impossibly high

1784
02:01:01,435 --> 02:01:07,675
To live with your heart
striving upward

1785
02:01:07,771 --> 02:01:11,066
To a far

1786
02:01:11,130 --> 02:01:15,162
Unattainable

1787
02:01:15,226 --> 02:01:22,233
Star
