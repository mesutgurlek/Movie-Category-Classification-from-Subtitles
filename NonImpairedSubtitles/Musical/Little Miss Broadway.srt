#Be optimistic#

00:01:10,003 --> 00:01:12,164
#Don't you be a grumpy#

3
00:01:12,305 --> 00:01:15,468
#When the road gets bumpy
just smile#

4
00:01:15,608 --> 00:01:17,542
#Smile and be happy#

00:01:17,677 --> 00:01:21,044
#Your trouble can't be
as bad as all that#

6
00:01:21,181 --> 00:01:23,547
#When you're sad as all that#

7
00:01:23,683 --> 00:01:26,709
#No one loves you#

8
00:01:26,853 --> 00:01:29,515
#Be optimistic#

00:01:29,656 --> 00:01:31,681
#Don't you be a mourner#

10
00:01:31,825 --> 00:01:33,793
#Brighten up that corner#

11
00:01:33,927 --> 00:01:36,919
- #And smile#
- #Smile#
- #Smile#

12
00:01:37,097 --> 00:01:41,864
#Don't wear a long face
it's never in style#

13
00:01:42,001 --> 00:01:45,664
#Be optimistic and smile#

14
00:01:46,773 --> 00:01:49,071
#Be optimistic#

00:01:49,209 --> 00:01:51,439
#Don't you be a grumpy#

#Your trouble can't be

18
00:02:00,086 --> 00:02:02,486
#When you're sad as all that#

19
00:02:02,622 --> 00:02:05,648
#No one loves you#

20
00:02:05,792 --> 00:02:08,352
#Be optimistic#

00:02:08,528 --> 00:02:10,553
#Don't you be a mourner#

22
00:02:10,730 --> 00:02:15,190
#Brighten up that corner

23
00:02:15,368 --> 00:02:17,359
#Don't wear a long face #

24
00:02:17,504 --> 00:02:20,302
# It's never in style#

00:02:20,440 --> 00:02:24,934
#Be optimistic and smile#

26
00:02:25,078 --> 00:02:29,344
More, Betsy! More!

27
00:02:32,085 --> 00:02:33,950
Now this concludes our little
entertainment...

28
00:02:34,087 --> 00:02:35,987
and I'm sure
we've all enjoyed it immensely.

29
00:02:36,122 --> 00:02:39,649
I'm sorry to say... or perhaps,
I really shouldn't say sorry...

30
00:02:39,826 --> 00:02:43,193
but we won't have the pleasure
of hearing Betsy sing for us again here.

31
00:02:43,329 --> 00:02:45,263
Betsy's leaving us today.

32
00:02:45,431 --> 00:02:48,161
Mr. Shea, who was
a dear friend of her parents...

33
00:02:48,301 --> 00:02:50,735
has come to take her to live
with him in New York.

34
00:02:50,904 --> 00:02:54,840
I'm sure she has everybody's
good wishes for happiness...

35
00:02:54,974 --> 00:02:56,965
in her new home.

36
00:03:09,622 --> 00:03:11,817
- Is that me?
- I guess it is.

37
00:03:11,958 --> 00:03:15,223
Gee. I'm certainly a big surprise
to myself!

38
00:03:15,395 --> 00:03:19,161
I'll get your coat and hat.

39
00:03:19,299 --> 00:03:21,426
Oh, you look
beautiful, Betsy!

40
00:03:21,568 --> 00:03:24,765
- It's just splendid, isn't it?
- Mm-hmm.

41
00:03:24,904 --> 00:03:30,103
I... I hope someday
you'll all have pretty dresses too.

42
00:03:30,243 --> 00:03:32,438
Betsy. We'll have
to hurry now, dear.

43
00:03:32,579 --> 00:03:35,707
I've still got to wrap all those toys
Mr. Shea's been bringing you.

44
00:03:35,848 --> 00:03:37,713
Couldn't I leave them here,
Miss Hutchins?

45
00:03:37,850 --> 00:03:39,715
Mmm, Mr. Shea might not like it.

46
00:03:39,852 --> 00:03:43,686
He won't care. Please, Miss Hutchins,
I'd much rather leave them here.

47
00:03:43,823 --> 00:03:47,122
Just give them to...
oh, everybody.

48
00:03:47,293 --> 00:03:50,854
Oh, that's sweet of you, dear.
Say thanks to Betsy, girls.

49
00:03:51,030 --> 00:03:53,055
Thank you, Betsy.

50
00:03:53,233 --> 00:03:56,259
Now say good-bye to everybody,
and we'll hurry along.

51
00:03:58,705 --> 00:04:02,971
- Good-bye Carol.
- Bye, Betsy.

52
00:04:03,109 --> 00:04:07,011
- Good-bye, Jean.
- Good-bye, Betsy.

53
00:04:07,146 --> 00:04:11,139
- Bye, Sheila.
- Good-bye, Betsy.

54
00:04:11,284 --> 00:04:14,845
- Good-bye, Marilyn.
- Good-bye, Betsy.

55
00:04:16,856 --> 00:04:19,518
- Good-bye, Mary.
- Good-bye, Betsy.

56
00:04:25,632 --> 00:04:28,328
Good-bye, Rosalie.

57
00:04:30,169 --> 00:04:32,763
What's the matter?
Don't you want to say good-bye to me?

58
00:04:32,905 --> 00:04:35,339
- No!
- Why, Rosalie. I'm surprised.

59
00:04:35,475 --> 00:04:37,534
Now be a nice girl.
Say good-bye to Betsy.

60
00:04:37,677 --> 00:04:39,668
No! I don't want to
say good-bye.

61
00:04:39,812 --> 00:04:42,940
- Why not?
- 'Cause...

62
00:04:43,082 --> 00:04:46,574
Because I don't want
Betsy to go.

63
00:04:48,888 --> 00:04:53,985
Betsy.! Betsy!
Betsy!

64
00:05:04,037 --> 00:05:06,938
Where's that button?

65
00:05:09,809 --> 00:05:13,939
#Should auld acquaintance#

66
00:05:14,080 --> 00:05:15,945
#Be forgot#

67
00:05:16,082 --> 00:05:18,949
#And never#

68
00:05:19,085 --> 00:05:22,919
#Brought to mind#

69
00:05:23,056 --> 00:05:27,390
#Should auld acquaintance#

70
00:05:27,560 --> 00:05:29,790
#Be forgot#

71
00:05:29,962 --> 00:05:32,055
#And days#

00:05:36,736 --> 00:05:42,140
#For auld lang syne#

74
00:05:42,275 --> 00:05:44,436
#My dear#

75
00:05:44,577 --> 00:05:49,844
#For auld lang syne#

76
00:05:49,982 --> 00:05:54,112
- #We'll take a cup#
- To the subway.

77
00:05:54,253 --> 00:05:57,120
#Of kindness yet#

78
00:05:57,256 --> 00:06:03,126
#For auld lang syne#

79
00:06:09,435 --> 00:06:11,596
Hotel Variety.

80
00:06:11,738 --> 00:06:16,573
The Three Dancing Baby Dolls?
They don't live here anymore.

81
00:06:16,709 --> 00:06:21,009
I don't know. I reckon
they retired on their social security.

82
00:06:21,147 --> 00:06:23,945
- You're welcome.
- Hi, Pop!

83
00:06:24,083 --> 00:06:27,519
Hello, Sam.
Flossie, see if you can locate Betsy.

84
00:06:27,653 --> 00:06:30,281
It's time she was in bed.

85
00:06:30,423 --> 00:06:32,755
- Hello? Is Betsy up there?
- Any mail for me, Pop?

86
00:06:32,892 --> 00:06:34,860
- You see...
- No, no mail for you, Sam.

87
00:06:35,027 --> 00:06:37,825
Any mail for his fiddle?

88
00:06:37,964 --> 00:06:42,799
Yeah, from its beau.

89
00:06:55,181 --> 00:06:58,548
Those are the kind of gags
that killed vaudeville.

90
00:06:58,684 --> 00:07:02,347
- Hello, Betsy.
- Hello. Hello.

91
00:07:02,488 --> 00:07:06,925
Upstage. Rehearse in the theater.

92
00:07:07,093 --> 00:07:11,029
- Hello, angel.
- Hello.

93
00:07:11,197 --> 00:07:14,166
- Where have you been?
- Oh, just visiting.

94
00:07:14,333 --> 00:07:17,496
Visiting, when you should have been
in bed? Have you done your homework?

95
00:07:17,637 --> 00:07:21,903
Oh, yes.
Here's my arithmetic.

96
00:07:22,041 --> 00:07:25,841
- Who helped you with these problems?
- Mr. Burdini, the magician.

97
00:07:25,978 --> 00:07:28,173
Hmm. Six goes into 18 five times?

98
00:07:28,314 --> 00:07:32,080
Seven goes into 21 four times?
He's a magician, all right.

99
00:07:32,218 --> 00:07:35,381
Oh, he's awful clever.
He's been teaching me new tricks.

100
00:07:35,521 --> 00:07:38,217
May I have my key, please?

101
00:07:41,027 --> 00:07:44,485
- Is that some of your ventriloquism?
- That wasn't me.

102
00:07:44,664 --> 00:07:47,428
Is there any mail for us?

103
00:07:51,070 --> 00:07:55,302
Oh, hello.
It's Mr. and Mrs. Brasno.

104
00:07:55,441 --> 00:07:57,875
- There you are.
- Thank you.

105
00:07:58,010 --> 00:08:01,537
- It's from our son.
- He's in college.

106
00:08:04,283 --> 00:08:08,686
- Look, Ma. Butch made the football team.
- Oh. Look.

107
00:08:08,821 --> 00:08:10,982
"Dearest Mom and Pop...

108
00:08:11,123 --> 00:08:13,148
"just a line or two.

109
00:08:13,292 --> 00:08:17,319
"Hope you and Mom are well and
have found something to do.

110
00:08:17,497 --> 00:08:19,431
"I am getting along fine with my studies.

111
00:08:19,565 --> 00:08:21,430
My goodness!

112
00:08:21,567 --> 00:08:23,797
As you can see,
I'm on the squad.''

113
00:08:23,936 --> 00:08:26,097
- Hello, George, Ollie!
Hiya, folks! Hello, Bets!
- Hello, Mike.

114
00:08:26,239 --> 00:08:30,471
- Is there anything for us, Mike?
- Buffalo, next week.

115
00:08:30,610 --> 00:08:32,976
One act for a smoker in a hurry.
How about you?

116
00:08:33,112 --> 00:08:35,945
Sorry, Mr. Brody.
I'm all booked up tonight.

117
00:08:36,082 --> 00:08:38,710
On the slumber time, huh? I get it.

118
00:08:38,851 --> 00:08:41,649
- Who do ya suggest, Pop?
- Why, let me see...

119
00:08:41,787 --> 00:08:44,654
- Better see who owes the most rent.
- Right.

120
00:08:47,660 --> 00:08:51,460
Well, there's Martin and Martin,
nine weeks.

121
00:08:51,597 --> 00:08:54,998
Sullivan and Haley,
six weeks.

122
00:08:55,167 --> 00:08:57,863
Jimmy Clayton and his jazz band,
it's 12 weeks.

123
00:08:58,004 --> 00:09:00,472
- How about them?
- They're a knockout.

124
00:09:00,606 --> 00:09:04,440
- All right, if you say so.
- Get Jimmy Clayton on the telephone.

125
00:09:09,515 --> 00:09:13,110
I raise a thousand bucks.

126
00:09:13,252 --> 00:09:17,450
- I think the phone's ringing.
- Don't change the subject.

127
00:09:26,632 --> 00:09:28,657
I call you.
What you got?

128
00:09:28,834 --> 00:09:30,768
- What do you got?
- Well, I...

129
00:09:30,937 --> 00:09:34,031
I just got a little pair
of threes.

130
00:09:34,173 --> 00:09:36,869
And I thought you was bluffing.

131
00:09:37,009 --> 00:09:39,807
Nuts to me,
you get it?

132
00:09:43,516 --> 00:09:45,484
Did you hang up
your dress?

133
00:09:45,618 --> 00:09:49,019
I hung up my dress, put away my shoes,
brushed my teeth...

134
00:09:49,155 --> 00:09:54,457
- washed my neck, face, hands and ears.
- Nice work.

135
00:09:57,863 --> 00:10:00,093
I used to have curls
all over my head once.

136
00:10:00,232 --> 00:10:04,566
- Oh, that must've been lovely.
- Yes, but they were lots of trouble.

137
00:10:06,806 --> 00:10:08,933
Now, don't you sit up
and listen to that music.

138
00:10:09,075 --> 00:10:11,441
You just shut your eyes
and go right to sleep.

139
00:10:11,577 --> 00:10:15,536
I'll shut my eyes, but it'll
probably come in through my ears.

140
00:10:27,893 --> 00:10:29,861
Hiya, Butch!

141
00:10:36,369 --> 00:10:38,735
Willoughby!

142
00:10:40,573 --> 00:10:42,632
- Willoughby.
- Yes, Sister?

143
00:10:42,775 --> 00:10:47,109
Close that window.
Hand me the telephone book.

144
00:10:47,246 --> 00:10:52,946
Yes, Sister.

145
00:10:53,085 --> 00:10:55,212
You seem to be enjoying
that horrible racket.

146
00:10:55,354 --> 00:10:57,219
Hmm?

147
00:10:57,356 --> 00:10:59,347
Well, I... I was carried away
for the moment.

148
00:10:59,492 --> 00:11:01,460
Hmm.

149
00:11:04,864 --> 00:11:09,267
Yes, Miss Wendling, this is
Mr. Shea's daughter. My father...

150
00:11:09,435 --> 00:11:12,632
I'm awfully sorry. The boys
are rehearsing, but I'd be glad to...

151
00:11:12,772 --> 00:11:14,740
I'm tired of warning
you people.

152
00:11:14,874 --> 00:11:18,071
I won't have my nights disturbed
by a lot of noisy riffraff.

153
00:11:18,210 --> 00:11:20,144
I won't put up with it
any longer.

154
00:11:20,279 --> 00:11:23,271
I'm sorry, Miss Wendling.
I'll go right up and...

155
00:11:28,387 --> 00:11:31,618
- What's the matter?
- She called us a lot of riffraff.

156
00:11:31,757 --> 00:11:33,691
- Who?
- Our landlady.

157
00:11:33,826 --> 00:11:36,522
- I didn't know we had one.
- Well, if you ever see a pumpkin...

158
00:11:36,696 --> 00:11:40,063
in one of the windows next door and it
isn't Halloween, that's our landlady.

159
00:11:40,199 --> 00:11:42,895
Ugh!

160
00:11:43,035 --> 00:11:46,903
I can't look out my window without
seeing a lot of acrobats, jugglers...

161
00:11:47,039 --> 00:11:49,200
midgets and actors.

162
00:11:49,341 --> 00:11:51,673
How much rent does
the Hotel Variety owe?

163
00:11:51,811 --> 00:11:54,143
$2,500 past due
since the 12th.

164
00:11:54,280 --> 00:11:57,181
Write a letter...
to what's-his-name... Shea.

165
00:11:57,316 --> 00:11:59,250
- Sarah!
- Ah!

166
00:11:59,385 --> 00:12:04,254
Tell him unless his rent is paid
within five days, in full, out he goes.

167
00:12:05,958 --> 00:12:09,189
- Come on. In you go.
- Oh, boy. Oh, boy. Oh, boy.

168
00:12:09,361 --> 00:12:11,955
I've got to go up there and
see about stopping that music.

169
00:12:12,131 --> 00:12:14,793
- Oh, no. I like it.
- You do?

170
00:12:14,934 --> 00:12:18,131
- Yes, especially that song.
- Well, it is a pretty song.

171
00:12:18,270 --> 00:12:20,204
- Know why I like it?
- No. Why?

172
00:12:20,339 --> 00:12:22,466
The words are just the way
I feel about you and Pop.

173
00:12:22,608 --> 00:12:24,473
No fooling?

174
00:12:24,610 --> 00:12:29,047
Lots of times I wanted to thank you,
oh, ever so much.

175
00:12:29,181 --> 00:12:31,308
Well, you don't have to,
darling.

176
00:12:31,450 --> 00:12:33,645
I'm afraid I can't
'cause...

177
00:12:33,886 --> 00:12:37,879
# ow can I thank you#

178
00:12:38,023 --> 00:12:41,481
#How do I start#

179
00:12:41,660 --> 00:12:45,027
#The words are somewhere#

180
00:12:45,164 --> 00:12:48,099
#Around my heart#

181
00:12:48,234 --> 00:12:50,702
#If I could say#

182
00:12:50,870 --> 00:12:55,739
#In a word or two#

183
00:12:55,875 --> 00:12:57,934
#How much it means#

184
00:12:58,077 --> 00:13:01,877
#To be loved by you#

185
00:13:03,215 --> 00:13:06,548
#Then I could thank you#

186
00:13:06,685 --> 00:13:10,212
# For all you've done #

187
00:13:10,356 --> 00:13:12,654
#But I don't know what#

188
00:13:12,792 --> 00:13:15,158
#To do#

189
00:13:16,829 --> 00:13:20,094
#What can you say#

190
00:13:20,232 --> 00:13:25,465
#When a dream comes true#

191
00:13:25,604 --> 00:13:28,596
# How can I ever#

192
00:13:28,741 --> 00:13:31,710
#Thank you#

193
00:13:34,547 --> 00:13:36,913
Mmm. Don't you try to, dear.

194
00:13:37,049 --> 00:13:39,779
Now you just close your eyes
and go right to sleep.

195
00:13:39,919 --> 00:13:41,887
- Happy dreams.
- Thanks.

196
00:13:42,021 --> 00:13:45,149
- Good night, darling.
- Good night.

197
00:13:46,258 --> 00:13:49,455
- Good night.
- Good night.

198
00:13:52,131 --> 00:13:54,861
You old pumpkin!

199
00:14:09,782 --> 00:14:15,277
We've got to stick together.
It's one for all, and divided we fall.

200
00:14:15,421 --> 00:14:19,482
The wolf is at the door,
and the handwriting is on the wall.

201
00:14:19,625 --> 00:14:23,288
- Pop's always been regular with us.
- He sure has.

202
00:14:23,462 --> 00:14:25,555
So what does
it get him?

203
00:14:25,731 --> 00:14:28,291
A shady nook behind
the eight ball.

204
00:14:28,467 --> 00:14:31,436
We got to go out and hock
everything we own.

205
00:14:31,570 --> 00:14:34,698
Jewelry, trunks, instruments,
props, everything.

206
00:14:34,840 --> 00:14:36,705
We've got our sorority pins.

207
00:14:36,842 --> 00:14:39,811
Get all the dough you can
and give it to Pop.

208
00:14:39,945 --> 00:14:43,210
If it wasn't for Pop, we'd all
have barnacles on our hips...

209
00:14:43,349 --> 00:14:45,214
from sleeping on park benches.

210
00:14:45,351 --> 00:14:48,115
And that's what'll happen if
that old battle-ax next door...

211
00:14:48,254 --> 00:14:50,154
puts him out of the hotel.

212
00:14:50,289 --> 00:14:52,553
It's up to us
to raise some dough.

213
00:14:52,691 --> 00:14:55,216
Jimmy,
here's my watch.

214
00:14:55,394 --> 00:14:57,259
What about that
stickpin?

215
00:14:57,396 --> 00:14:59,261
Oh-Oh, wait, wait!
You're choking me!

216
00:14:59,398 --> 00:15:01,195
My goodness,
don't pull it so hard.

217
00:15:01,333 --> 00:15:03,198
I'll give it to you.

218
00:15:22,855 --> 00:15:25,483
- Yes?
- May I see Miss Sarah Wendling, please?

219
00:15:25,624 --> 00:15:28,889
- She's not at home.
- When will she be back?

220
00:15:29,061 --> 00:15:31,052
I don't know.

221
00:15:54,320 --> 00:15:57,050
If you're looking for Miss Wendling,
she isn't home.

222
00:15:57,189 --> 00:16:00,056
- Is that so?
- I'm waiting for her too.

223
00:16:00,192 --> 00:16:03,855
- You are?
- Oh, yes, on important business.

224
00:16:04,029 --> 00:16:08,329
Well, uh, maybe if it's very important,
I might put in a good word for you.

225
00:16:08,467 --> 00:16:11,732
- Do you know Miss Wendling?
- Oh, yes, very well.

226
00:16:11,870 --> 00:16:15,499
- She's my aunt.
- She is? Well, say...

227
00:16:15,641 --> 00:16:17,632
would you please give her this...

228
00:16:17,776 --> 00:16:21,075
and tell her it's on account
for the rent of the hotel?

229
00:16:25,484 --> 00:16:29,215
- The hotel? What hotel?
- Next door.

230
00:16:29,355 --> 00:16:33,451
And will you please ask her
to wait until Pop can pay her the rest?

231
00:16:33,592 --> 00:16:36,993
Well, uh... uh, whom shall I say
this is from?

232
00:16:37,129 --> 00:16:40,997
Betsy. No, from Pop...
Mr. Shea.

233
00:16:41,133 --> 00:16:43,567
Well, maybe it'd be
a better idea...

234
00:16:43,702 --> 00:16:45,727
if you came inside
and told her yourself.

235
00:16:45,871 --> 00:16:48,965
But she's not in.
He said so.

236
00:16:49,108 --> 00:16:51,906
Oh, he did?

237
00:16:52,044 --> 00:16:56,572
I have an idea he's been
imagining things.

238
00:16:56,715 --> 00:16:59,616
- Miss Wendling is in, isn't she, Simmons?
- She's in the library, sir.

239
00:16:59,752 --> 00:17:01,947
Oh!

240
00:17:02,087 --> 00:17:04,112
Oh.

241
00:17:09,728 --> 00:17:15,189
Stand in the corner.
Go on. Hide your face.

242
00:17:17,636 --> 00:17:20,662
You big fibber!

243
00:17:20,806 --> 00:17:23,240
That'll be all,
Simmons.

244
00:17:23,375 --> 00:17:25,673
Why, if anyone did a thing
like that at the orphanage...

245
00:17:25,811 --> 00:17:27,745
they'd have to stand
in the corner for an hour.

246
00:17:27,880 --> 00:17:29,745
At the orphanage?

247
00:17:29,882 --> 00:17:32,146
Mm-hmm. I used to be an orphan
before Pop adopted me.

248
00:17:32,284 --> 00:17:36,914
Well, now that's a coincidence.
You know, I used to be an orphan myself.

249
00:17:37,056 --> 00:17:39,149
Too bad we weren't orphans
at the same time.

250
00:17:39,291 --> 00:17:42,749
- We could've had lots of fun together.
- I'll bet we could.

251
00:17:42,928 --> 00:17:46,728
- Will you excuse me a minute?
- Mm-hmm.

252
00:17:53,472 --> 00:17:55,406
Say, that's cute.
Where'd you learn that?

253
00:17:55,541 --> 00:17:57,509
- Jimmy and the Bandits.
- The what?

254
00:17:57,643 --> 00:18:00,305
- The jazz band.
- Oh. Look at this.

255
00:18:05,551 --> 00:18:07,416
That's good too.
Where'd you learn that?

256
00:18:07,553 --> 00:18:09,680
At Harvard. You've heard
of the Hasty Pudding club?

257
00:18:09,822 --> 00:18:12,120
Mm-mmm. But I'll bet
it tastes good.

258
00:18:12,257 --> 00:18:16,489
- We dancers have got to stick together.
- Absolutely.

259
00:18:16,695 --> 00:18:19,493
#We should be together#

260
00:18:19,631 --> 00:18:22,065
#Like the walls
and ceiling#

261
00:18:22,201 --> 00:18:24,795
#Like a door
and doorknob#

262
00:18:24,937 --> 00:18:27,531
#Like the hat
on your knob#

263
00:18:27,673 --> 00:18:29,834
#Like butler goes
with doorbell#

264
00:18:29,975 --> 00:18:31,909
#Keyhole with key#

265
00:18:32,044 --> 00:18:34,842
#I think we'll get by#

266
00:18:34,980 --> 00:18:38,006
#If you'll stick with me#

267
00:18:38,150 --> 00:18:40,744
#We should be together #

268
00:18:40,886 --> 00:18:43,377
#Like the frame
and picture#

269
00:18:43,522 --> 00:18:45,547
#Like shoes
and stockings#

270
00:18:45,691 --> 00:18:48,524
#Like the clock's
tick-tockings#

271
00:18:48,694 --> 00:18:54,428
- #Like tap and toe like high and low#
- #Stop and go, honey#

272
00:18:54,566 --> 00:18:58,195
- #You're a perfect lady#
- #You're a regular guy#

273
00:18:58,337 --> 00:19:00,202
Oh, thanks.

274
00:19:00,339 --> 00:19:02,807
#We should be together
you and I#

275
00:20:37,236 --> 00:20:39,500
- #You're a cup of coffee#
- Ho, ho!

276
00:20:39,638 --> 00:20:41,572
#You're a peachy pie#

277
00:20:41,707 --> 00:20:45,609
#We should be together
you and I#

278
00:20:46,078 --> 00:20:50,105
- Roger, what's going on?
- Oh, g... good morning, Aunt Sarah.

279
00:20:50,249 --> 00:20:52,547
Betsy, this is Miss Wendling,
and this is Uncle Willoughby.

280
00:20:52,684 --> 00:20:54,618
How do you do,
Miss Wendling?

281
00:20:57,389 --> 00:21:00,381
- How do you do, Mr. Uncle Willoughby?
- Charmed, I'm sure.

282
00:21:00,525 --> 00:21:02,516
What nonsense are you up to?

283
00:21:02,694 --> 00:21:04,559
This isn't nonsense.
This is high finance.

284
00:21:04,696 --> 00:21:06,664
Hear the pretty music?

285
00:21:06,832 --> 00:21:09,027
This young lady wants
to give you money to pay the rent.

286
00:21:09,167 --> 00:21:13,399
- Oh, nonsense!
- Come on, Betsy.

287
00:21:13,538 --> 00:21:17,030
- So you've gone in for social service?
- Oh, not exactly, Aunt Sarah.

288
00:21:17,175 --> 00:21:19,507
I just met an acquaintance here.

289
00:21:19,645 --> 00:21:21,840
There's almost five dollars in there.

290
00:21:21,980 --> 00:21:25,074
I'm sure Pop'll have the rest of it
for you very soon.

291
00:21:25,217 --> 00:21:28,414
- Bless my soul!
- Keep your soul out of this.

292
00:21:28,553 --> 00:21:31,351
- You'll please get rid of this child.
- But, Aunt Sarah...

293
00:21:31,490 --> 00:21:33,856
If those people think they can
play on my sympathy like this...

294
00:21:34,026 --> 00:21:35,891
they're greatly mistaken.

295
00:21:36,028 --> 00:21:39,794
I'll have my rent... all of it...
or out they go.

296
00:21:39,931 --> 00:21:44,061
Please, Miss Wendling.
Please don't put Pop out of the hotel.

297
00:21:44,202 --> 00:21:49,230
He and Barbara and Jimmy and everybody,
they'll have no place to live.

298
00:21:49,374 --> 00:21:51,308
That's their affair,
not mine.

299
00:21:51,443 --> 00:21:54,071
But, Aunt Sarah,
aren't you being a little bit hard?

300
00:21:54,212 --> 00:21:57,181
- Yes, Sarah, I think...
- Think to yourself.

301
00:21:57,316 --> 00:22:01,252
The place is an infernal nuisance,
full of worthless, disreputable actors.

302
00:22:01,386 --> 00:22:04,719
They are not disputable!
They're very good actors.

303
00:22:04,856 --> 00:22:06,790
- Thank you.
- Roger.

304
00:22:06,925 --> 00:22:10,053
Just charge it to my share of the estate.

305
00:22:10,228 --> 00:22:13,356
Simmons.
You will get rid of this child.

306
00:22:13,532 --> 00:22:15,466
You don't need to get rid of me.
I can go.

307
00:22:15,600 --> 00:22:17,534
Just a moment, Betsy.

308
00:22:17,669 --> 00:22:19,603
Aunt Sarah, I don't wish
to seem impertinent...

309
00:22:19,738 --> 00:22:21,763
but after all, I do have
a third interest in the hotel.

310
00:22:21,907 --> 00:22:23,772
As long as I have charge of
the Wendling estate...

311
00:22:23,909 --> 00:22:25,774
I'll handle it in my own way.

312
00:22:25,911 --> 00:22:29,870
Simmons, see this child
to the door. Stand aside.

313
00:22:33,151 --> 00:22:35,949
Uh, that'll be all, Simmons.
I'll see the young lady home.

314
00:22:36,088 --> 00:22:39,580
- Come on, Betsy.
- Wait. Shh. Just a minute.

315
00:22:43,995 --> 00:22:46,225
- Here, take these.
- Thanks, Uncle Willoughby.

316
00:22:46,365 --> 00:22:50,699
- Simmons, get my hat and coat, please.
- Very good, sir.

317
00:22:50,836 --> 00:22:53,828
Say, I may want to see you
about this a little later.

318
00:22:53,972 --> 00:22:59,069
No, no, no. I don't want
to be involved, but I'll be at the club.

319
00:22:59,211 --> 00:23:02,578
Come, come, young lady.
Cheer up, darling. Cheer up.

320
00:23:02,714 --> 00:23:05,274
I guess I'm not
a very good businesswoman.

321
00:23:05,417 --> 00:23:08,978
Oh, that's great. Then you won't
grow up to be like my Aunt Sarah.

322
00:23:09,121 --> 00:23:12,181
- Shh.
- Come on, honey.

323
00:23:15,127 --> 00:23:17,994
Thank you, Simmons.
See you later, Uncle Willoughby.

324
00:23:18,130 --> 00:23:21,531
- Good-bye, Mr. Uncle Willoughby.
- Bye-bye, Betsy.

325
00:23:24,336 --> 00:23:28,500
And if you say one word to my sister
about those cookies...

326
00:23:28,640 --> 00:23:31,370
I'll smack you
right in the kisser.

327
00:23:31,510 --> 00:23:33,535
Very good, sir.

328
00:23:40,152 --> 00:23:44,350
You know you shouldn't have
gone over there without permission.

329
00:23:44,489 --> 00:23:48,323
- I was only trying to help, Pop.
- I'm glad she did.

330
00:23:48,493 --> 00:23:52,759
I'd never have known that this place
existed. It's all very interesting.

331
00:23:52,898 --> 00:23:56,459
Next door, we hardly realize we're so
close to anything so, uh... so different.

332
00:23:56,601 --> 00:24:00,230
I suppose you feel like a feudal lord
visiting the tenants on his estate.

333
00:24:00,305 --> 00:24:03,797
I bet you'd look grand all dressed up
like a knight on a big white horse.

334
00:24:03,942 --> 00:24:06,809
Riding back to his castle
for safety?

335
00:24:06,945 --> 00:24:09,505
No. Rescuing
the fairy princess.

336
00:24:09,648 --> 00:24:12,242
I mean,
two fairy princesses.

337
00:24:12,384 --> 00:24:16,150
Mr. Wendling, I couldn't
possibly raise the money in five days.

338
00:24:16,288 --> 00:24:19,416
Well, as a matter of fact,
I was going to make a suggestion...

339
00:24:19,558 --> 00:24:22,083
before your daughter
so graciously knighted me.

340
00:24:22,260 --> 00:24:26,959
I was going to suggest that I could lend you
the 2,500. My aunt needn't know.

341
00:24:27,098 --> 00:24:31,034
You'd lend... Why...
Thanks a million.

342
00:24:31,203 --> 00:24:33,262
Thanks two million...
one from me.

343
00:24:33,405 --> 00:24:35,373
I'm afraid we can't accept
your generous offer.

344
00:24:35,507 --> 00:24:38,704
- Why not, Barbara?
- Because I don't know how
we could pay it back.

345
00:24:38,844 --> 00:24:41,142
And we're not going to be at the mercy
of any spiteful old moneybag...

346
00:24:41,279 --> 00:24:43,213
who calls us
a lot of riffraff.

347
00:24:46,017 --> 00:24:47,951
I'm sorry, Mr. Shea. I, uh...

348
00:24:48,086 --> 00:24:51,385
So am I. You see, I just couldn't
accept your kind offer now.

349
00:24:51,523 --> 00:24:55,823
- I understand.
- Come, Betsy. It's time for your lunch.

350
00:24:55,994 --> 00:24:58,360
Pop? Couldn't Mr. Wendling
stay and have lunch with me?

351
00:24:58,497 --> 00:25:00,362
Well, I'm afraid...

352
00:25:00,499 --> 00:25:02,729
As a matter of fact, I was
going to invite you to lunch...

353
00:25:02,868 --> 00:25:06,736
but I guess the Wendlings are sort
of social outcasts around here now.

354
00:25:06,872 --> 00:25:09,807
- Please let me go with him.
- I wish you would.

355
00:25:09,941 --> 00:25:13,377
Please, Pop. I'm old enough to go out
with a nice young man.

356
00:25:18,550 --> 00:25:22,919
- All right.
- It's a date.

357
00:25:23,054 --> 00:25:24,988
Barbara's awful smart.

358
00:25:25,123 --> 00:25:28,115
She reads great big books
when she's not helping Pop at the hotel.

359
00:25:28,293 --> 00:25:30,227
- Oh, she does?
- Yes.

360
00:25:30,395 --> 00:25:33,387
She told me she's studying
how not to be an actress.

361
00:25:33,565 --> 00:25:36,500
Oh. I see.

362
00:25:36,635 --> 00:25:39,627
Well, uh, does she have
many boyfriends?

363
00:25:39,771 --> 00:25:41,636
Oh, yes, lots of them.

364
00:25:41,773 --> 00:25:44,640
There's Ole, the Four Martins,
Jimmy and his Jazz Bandits...

365
00:25:44,776 --> 00:25:48,473
No, no. I mean, is there anybody
that takes her out to dinner, lunch...

366
00:25:48,613 --> 00:25:51,878
- You know, a sweetheart?
- Oh.

367
00:25:52,017 --> 00:25:56,215
No. I guess she's just an old maid,
like I was till you came along.

368
00:25:58,423 --> 00:26:00,288
Say, are you trying to tell me
that you like me?

369
00:26:00,425 --> 00:26:02,120
Mm-hmm.

370
00:26:02,327 --> 00:26:05,262
#I can't show
how much I love you#

371
00:26:05,430 --> 00:26:08,160
#In this little space
I've got#

372
00:26:08,300 --> 00:26:11,235
#I don't know how much
I love you#

373
00:26:11,403 --> 00:26:13,837
#But it's an enormous lot#

374
00:26:13,972 --> 00:26:17,135
#If all the world were paper#

375
00:26:17,275 --> 00:26:19,971
#And all the seas were ink#

376
00:26:20,111 --> 00:26:23,012
#I'd write a great
big note to you#

377
00:26:23,148 --> 00:26:25,708
#And tell you what I think#

378
00:26:25,850 --> 00:26:28,375
#I'd say
I love you dearly#

379
00:26:28,520 --> 00:26:31,114
#In letters
three miles high#

380
00:26:31,256 --> 00:26:33,554
#And sign it yours sincerely#

381
00:26:33,692 --> 00:26:36,160
#Cross my heart
and hope to die#

382
00:26:36,328 --> 00:26:39,593
#If all the stars
were diamonds#

383
00:26:39,731 --> 00:26:42,359
#In golden skies above#

384
00:26:42,500 --> 00:26:47,369
#They wouldn't be worth that
without your love#

385
00:26:47,505 --> 00:26:50,872
#I'd like to write
I love you#

386
00:26:51,009 --> 00:26:53,603
#So big that you would blink#

387
00:26:53,745 --> 00:26:56,009
#If all the world were paper#

388
00:26:56,147 --> 00:26:59,776
#Yes, and all the seas
were ink#

389
00:27:10,328 --> 00:27:12,660
What are all those mummies
sitting in there for?

390
00:27:12,797 --> 00:27:14,662
Mummies?

391
00:27:14,799 --> 00:27:17,563
Those aren't mummies, Betsy...
Those are millionaires.

392
00:27:17,702 --> 00:27:19,693
They spent all their lives
trying to make a million dollars...

393
00:27:19,838 --> 00:27:22,568
and now they sit there
wondering why.

394
00:27:31,516 --> 00:27:33,575
- Hello, old-timer!
- Shh!

395
00:27:33,718 --> 00:27:36,710
- Is, uh, Mr. Wendling in?
- He's in the Grill, sir.

396
00:27:36,855 --> 00:27:39,847
Oh, he's in the Grill.

397
00:28:19,064 --> 00:28:23,797
#I love you as I never#

398
00:28:23,935 --> 00:28:29,805
#Loved before #

399
00:28:29,941 --> 00:28:34,776
#Since first I met you
on the village green#

400
00:28:34,913 --> 00:28:40,579
#The village green#

401
00:28:40,719 --> 00:28:44,155
#Come to me ere my dream#

402
00:28:44,289 --> 00:28:46,985
#Of love#

403
00:28:47,125 --> 00:28:53,030
#Is o'er#

404
00:28:53,164 --> 00:28:57,897
- #I love you...
- mJim, wait a minute. That's terrible!

405
00:28:58,036 --> 00:28:59,901
Oh, just a minute, gentlemen.
Whoa, just a moment now.

406
00:29:01,973 --> 00:29:05,101
- I was standing right here.
Someone was a little bit sour.
- It was you.

407
00:29:05,243 --> 00:29:10,476
What? Well, what do you know about music?

408
00:29:10,615 --> 00:29:12,947
Well, of all
the impertinence.

409
00:29:13,084 --> 00:29:15,609
You were off-key.
That part goes like this.

410
00:29:15,754 --> 00:29:20,088
#I love you as I loved you#

411
00:29:20,225 --> 00:29:23,251
#When you were sweet#

412
00:29:23,428 --> 00:29:25,988
- That's just the way I did it.
- Oh, no!

413
00:29:26,164 --> 00:29:27,529
- I did!
- No. No.

414
00:29:27,665 --> 00:29:30,361
- Let's try it again.
- All right, you take it.

415
00:29:30,502 --> 00:29:34,165
# I love you as I loved you #

416
00:29:34,305 --> 00:29:38,503
- #When you were sweet#
- # Sweet#

417
00:29:38,643 --> 00:29:43,808
#When you were sweet #

418
00:29:43,948 --> 00:29:47,406
#Sixteen#

419
00:29:47,552 --> 00:29:51,147
That's the best you've ever done!

420
00:29:51,356 --> 00:29:54,189
Now we got it.
Let's hold it.

421
00:29:54,325 --> 00:29:56,657
- The youngster knows
her stuff, don't she?
- She sure does.

422
00:29:56,828 --> 00:30:00,423
Begging your pardon, gentlemen.
So sorry, but, uh, this noise...

423
00:30:00,598 --> 00:30:03,032
- Noise?
- What are you talking about?

424
00:30:03,201 --> 00:30:05,169
We've been having complaints.
The other club members...

425
00:30:05,336 --> 00:30:07,201
Just when we're getting hot!

426
00:30:07,338 --> 00:30:09,238
What's this country coming to
if a man can't sing in his club?

427
00:30:09,374 --> 00:30:12,605
Isn't there someplace we can rehearse
without being disturbed?

428
00:30:12,744 --> 00:30:14,712
- I know a place!
- Yeah? Where?

429
00:30:14,846 --> 00:30:16,814
- A hotel!
- Say, that's a swell idea.

430
00:30:16,948 --> 00:30:20,782
No, it won't work. We've been thrown out
of the finest hotels in New York...

431
00:30:20,919 --> 00:30:23,149
- The Waldorf-Astoria and St. Regis.
- That's right.

432
00:30:23,288 --> 00:30:26,155
Well, you'll never
be thrown out of this one.

433
00:30:26,291 --> 00:30:28,623
This one is just
made-to-order for you.

434
00:30:28,793 --> 00:30:31,819
Just say you're a quartet,
and you can sing all you want.

435
00:30:31,996 --> 00:30:36,194
Really? Where is this place?
You mean...

436
00:30:36,334 --> 00:30:39,132
She's right! Come on, boys!
A haven at last!

437
00:30:39,270 --> 00:30:42,330
Last one out's an old maid!

438
00:30:42,473 --> 00:30:46,842
- Well, I'm not gonna be any old maid!
- Come on, Betsy. Hurry up!

439
00:30:48,980 --> 00:30:51,380
Eight bucks from
the Tristate Trio...

440
00:30:51,516 --> 00:30:54,314
five from Daugherty,
and five from Conklin and Scully.

441
00:30:54,452 --> 00:30:58,548
- How much are we short?
- About 2,100.

442
00:30:58,690 --> 00:31:01,750
The national debt.
I thought I was bringing home the bacon.

443
00:31:01,926 --> 00:31:03,951
And you laid an egg.

444
00:31:04,128 --> 00:31:06,289
That's right. Bite the hand
that feeds the kitty.

445
00:31:06,464 --> 00:31:11,163
Thanks just the same.
You're a great guy, Jimmy.

446
00:31:13,671 --> 00:31:16,765
That goes for me too,
bubble brain.

447
00:31:16,908 --> 00:31:21,140
Is that straight
from the balcony, Juliet?

448
00:31:21,279 --> 00:31:23,679
It's my streamlined
personality.

449
00:31:23,815 --> 00:31:28,650
- I guess I'm not as bad as I look, huh?
- You couldn't be!

450
00:31:28,786 --> 00:31:31,619
That's done it! From now on
when you talk to me...

451
00:31:31,756 --> 00:31:35,419
start the conversation
with good-bye.

452
00:31:35,693 --> 00:31:39,185
- This way, gentlemen.
- Oh, Pop!

453
00:31:39,364 --> 00:31:42,492
Hurry, Pop.
We brought you some new guests.

454
00:31:42,634 --> 00:31:44,568
These gentlemen were looking
for a hotel...

455
00:31:44,736 --> 00:31:46,761
so Betsy suggested
that they come over here.

456
00:31:46,905 --> 00:31:50,341
- Um, professionals?
- Ooh, yes. They're a quartet.

457
00:31:50,475 --> 00:31:53,342
Yes. This is the well-known
Hot and Happy Four.

458
00:31:53,478 --> 00:31:56,242
Yes! The Hop and Hat...
the Hot and Happy Four.

459
00:31:56,381 --> 00:31:59,714
- Where have you boys been playing?
- Ooh, hotels, clubs...

460
00:31:59,851 --> 00:32:01,716
churches and places.

461
00:32:01,853 --> 00:32:04,219
Now, would you prefer
single rooms or a suite?

462
00:32:04,355 --> 00:32:08,291
- They want the best in
the house, don't you?
- Yes! Certainly!

463
00:32:08,459 --> 00:32:13,328
There's a nice, big suite on the fourth
floor with four beds and a green carpet.

464
00:32:13,464 --> 00:32:16,160
Green? My favorite color.
We'll take that.

465
00:32:16,301 --> 00:32:18,861
Well, that's pretty high:
$40 a week.

466
00:32:19,003 --> 00:32:21,437
That's not too steep for
these gentlemen, is it?

467
00:32:21,572 --> 00:32:23,540
No! Not at all!

468
00:32:23,675 --> 00:32:26,405
That's fine.
Uh... Uh...

469
00:32:26,544 --> 00:32:28,478
- Where is your baggage?
- Huh?

470
00:32:28,613 --> 00:32:31,241
Baggage? Oh, baggage!
Oh, well... well...

471
00:32:31,382 --> 00:32:34,283
Well, we could get some if you...
if it's necessary.

472
00:32:34,419 --> 00:32:38,617
Oh, it's very necessary. 'Cause guests
without baggage have to pay in advance.

473
00:32:38,756 --> 00:32:41,384
- Isn't that right, Pop?
- It's a rule of the house.

474
00:32:41,526 --> 00:32:44,620
Oh, that's quite all right.
How much will you want in advance?

475
00:32:44,796 --> 00:32:47,424
- Well...
- Uh, suppose we let Betsy decide that.

476
00:32:47,598 --> 00:32:50,726
Well, let's see.

477
00:32:50,868 --> 00:32:54,133
I think about,
well, 10 years.

478
00:32:56,374 --> 00:32:59,343
- No. Suppose we make it one year?
- Oh, no, no. That's too much.

479
00:32:59,477 --> 00:33:02,037
No. I'm sure these gentlemen
would rather pay one year in advance.

480
00:33:02,180 --> 00:33:04,114
- Wouldn't you?
- Yes, sir. Certainly.

481
00:33:04,248 --> 00:33:07,046
Then they wouldn't have to worry
about the rent, and neither would you.

482
00:33:07,185 --> 00:33:10,450
There you are, sir.
Fifty-two times 40 is 2,008.

483
00:33:10,588 --> 00:33:14,251
Gee! You're awful good in arithmetic.

484
00:33:14,392 --> 00:33:19,329
That's fine.
Uh, 426.

485
00:33:19,464 --> 00:33:22,956
I'll take them up.
Follow me, gentlemen.

486
00:33:26,704 --> 00:33:29,730
#Mi, mi, mi, mi, mi, mi, mi, mi...#

487
00:33:29,874 --> 00:33:31,808
Say, how are
the acoustics here?

488
00:33:31,943 --> 00:33:35,242
Oh, we don't have any.
We use Flit.

489
00:33:35,380 --> 00:33:38,008
She uses Flit!

490
00:33:38,149 --> 00:33:40,413
Come on.

491
00:33:42,920 --> 00:33:47,414
I hope it don't bounce.

492
00:33:53,765 --> 00:33:55,699
Pop, here's
25 bucks more.

493
00:33:55,867 --> 00:33:58,665
I got it, Jimmy.
I got the 2,500.

494
00:33:58,770 --> 00:34:03,332
What? And we just made
the supreme sacrifice! Look!

495
00:34:03,474 --> 00:34:07,103
- What happened?
- We done a striptease in a pawnshop.

496
00:34:07,245 --> 00:34:11,739
Georgie. Georgie, where are you?
Your watch!

497
00:34:11,883 --> 00:34:14,010
Marco, your dummy!

498
00:34:14,152 --> 00:34:16,950
Take your drums away, Jerry!
Take them away!

499
00:34:17,088 --> 00:34:19,750
Here's the cello
for Heinie!

500
00:34:19,891 --> 00:34:24,191
Here's your piccolo.
Here you are, Syd. Take it away.

501
00:34:24,362 --> 00:34:26,296
The twins.

502
00:34:26,464 --> 00:34:29,729
- Your paternity pins.
- Thanks, Jimmy.

503
00:34:29,867 --> 00:34:34,201
- Ole. Your waker-upper.
- Oh, thank you, Jimmy.

504
00:34:34,338 --> 00:34:36,670
Oh, no, no, no!
P-Please don't do that.

505
00:34:36,808 --> 00:34:39,242
Jimmy, how you get them
out the hock?

506
00:34:39,377 --> 00:34:41,777
Ask me no questions.

507
00:34:46,818 --> 00:34:49,810
- Mr. Wendling?
- Oh, hello. You still mad?

508
00:34:49,954 --> 00:34:53,651
How could I be after all you've done
for us? May I say thank you?

509
00:34:53,791 --> 00:34:56,760
Well, sure, if you'll omit the ''mister''
and make it plain ''Roger.''

510
00:34:56,894 --> 00:34:59,226
- Thank you, Roger.
- That's okay.

511
00:34:59,363 --> 00:35:03,322
Barbara, Betsy wants you upstairs
to help her with her reading lesson.

512
00:35:03,501 --> 00:35:06,129
Tell her I'll be right up.

513
00:35:06,270 --> 00:35:08,465
Could I go along?
I used to be very good at reading.

514
00:35:08,606 --> 00:35:11,905
- Well, Betsy's in the third grade.
- Third grade? That high?

515
00:35:12,043 --> 00:35:14,238
- Well, maybe I could learn something.
- Come on!

516
00:35:14,378 --> 00:35:18,872
'''Run for your life,' said the little
princess. 'I am the cap... “Cap...”

517
00:35:19,016 --> 00:35:22,679
- Now slowly. What's this?
- “Tive.” “Captive.” Oh, yeah.

518
00:35:22,820 --> 00:35:27,223
“I am the captive of a wicked, old sor...”
“Sor...” “Sorce...”

519
00:35:27,358 --> 00:35:29,223
Sorceress.

520
00:35:29,393 --> 00:35:32,021
You mustn't tell her.
Let her figure the words out herself.

521
00:35:32,196 --> 00:35:34,721
“I'm not afraid”'
said the brave young prince.

522
00:35:34,899 --> 00:35:39,598
'I have come to rescue you
and take you to my castle.”

523
00:35:39,737 --> 00:35:41,967
I like him.

524
00:35:42,106 --> 00:35:44,097
''But you are in
great pearl...”

525
00:35:44,242 --> 00:35:46,210
Peril.
That means danger.

526
00:35:46,344 --> 00:35:48,904
Then why doesn't
it say “danger”?

527
00:35:49,046 --> 00:35:51,276
All right.
Skip it.

528
00:35:51,415 --> 00:35:53,883
“Suddenly there was
a great roar behind him.

529
00:35:54,018 --> 00:35:59,615
“It was the wicked old 'sore-sorce-ess'
riding on her broom.

530
00:35:59,757 --> 00:36:02,248
“On her shoulder
was a dodo bird...

531
00:36:02,426 --> 00:36:05,827
and the dodo bird was
whispering in her ear...”

532
00:36:05,997 --> 00:36:10,764
- This is Winchell's daily chatter.
- Mmm.

533
00:36:10,902 --> 00:36:16,636
''That expensive speed buggy parked daily
in front of Pop Shea's Hotel Variety...

534
00:36:16,774 --> 00:36:19,766
“belongs to
the Roger Wending...

535
00:36:19,911 --> 00:36:24,871
and the reason is Pop's
lovely daughter, Barbara.”

536
00:36:25,016 --> 00:36:28,645
I thought it my duty to
inform you, Miss Wendling.

537
00:36:32,690 --> 00:36:35,659
So that's why he hasn't
been dining at home.

538
00:36:35,826 --> 00:36:38,556
Cancel my reservations.
I'll take a later train to Newport.

539
00:36:38,729 --> 00:36:41,527
I'll put a stop
to all this right now.

540
00:36:53,678 --> 00:36:58,012
Look, I want to show you here.

541
00:36:58,149 --> 00:37:01,084
Now look. Up here's the little boy.
The little boy comes down here.

542
00:37:01,219 --> 00:37:04,484
And he's got a dog,
but the dog won't come downstairs.

543
00:37:04,622 --> 00:37:08,251
The little boy goes upstairs,
and he chucks the dog downstairs.

544
00:37:08,392 --> 00:37:10,417
Isn’t that good?

545
00:37:10,595 --> 00:37:13,428
So you don't like that.
Look, come here. I show you another.

546
00:37:20,171 --> 00:37:23,368
Come, come. Isn't there anyone
looking after this place?

547
00:37:23,507 --> 00:37:28,706
No! You all can't call South Brooklyn.
It's 10 cents in advance.

548
00:37:28,846 --> 00:37:30,871
Come, come.

549
00:37:34,418 --> 00:37:36,283
With or without bath?

550
00:37:36,487 --> 00:37:38,478
I don't want a bath...
I mean a room.

551
00:37:38,623 --> 00:37:40,557
I want to talk to that man
Shea's daughter.

552
00:37:40,691 --> 00:37:44,127
She's upstairs right now.
Is there anything I can do?

553
00:37:44,262 --> 00:37:46,253
There is... Have her
come downstairs at once.

554
00:37:46,430 --> 00:37:50,025
Park yourself over there,
and I'll see if I can get her.

555
00:38:07,618 --> 00:38:10,781
You got a cigarette,
grandma?

556
00:38:10,921 --> 00:38:14,186
- No, and I'm not your grandmother.
- It's okay by me, toots.

557
00:38:14,325 --> 00:38:16,293
Too...

558
00:38:16,460 --> 00:38:18,394
What a face! What a face!

559
00:38:18,529 --> 00:38:21,157
- What?
- Gordon's play.
You'd be great for the old witch.

560
00:38:21,332 --> 00:38:24,665
Oh, I would.
Well, don't blow that smoke in my face.

561
00:38:38,849 --> 00:38:41,511
Come on, Oscar.
We're going up.

562
00:38:46,357 --> 00:38:48,791
Hello, Aunt Sarah.

563
00:38:48,959 --> 00:38:51,120
It's the old pumpkin.

564
00:38:51,295 --> 00:38:53,160
So this is where you've been
wasting your time.

565
00:38:53,297 --> 00:38:55,162
Aunt Sarah, please. Please.

566
00:38:55,299 --> 00:38:58,564
Uh, Barbara, Betsy.
I'd like you to meet my aunt.

567
00:38:58,703 --> 00:39:01,672
- This is Miss Shea and Miss Betsy Shea.
Miss Wendling.
- How do you do?

568
00:39:01,806 --> 00:39:04,331
Young lady, I've come here
to tell you...

569
00:39:04,475 --> 00:39:06,443
that I want you to
let this nephew of mine alone.

570
00:39:06,577 --> 00:39:08,545
You let him pay your rent,
didn't you?

571
00:39:08,679 --> 00:39:11,273
- Aunt Sarah!
- I don't have to listen to this.

572
00:39:11,415 --> 00:39:14,407
Aunt Sarah, that was uncalled for,
unkind and untrue.

573
00:39:14,552 --> 00:39:17,419
Uncle Roger didn't give us any money.
We got it from...

574
00:39:17,555 --> 00:39:19,523
from someone else.

575
00:39:19,657 --> 00:39:21,522
Oh, so it's Uncle Roger now.

576
00:39:21,659 --> 00:39:25,390
- Is thi...- this woman your mother?
- Practically.

577
00:39:25,563 --> 00:39:28,464
- Betsy is Mr. Shea's adopted child.
- Adopted her?

578
00:39:28,599 --> 00:39:32,000
So they brought her to this wholesome
atmosphere. Nice place for a child.

579
00:39:32,136 --> 00:39:36,232
Why, she's using her as a decoy, and
you haven't sense enough to realize it.

580
00:39:36,374 --> 00:39:38,239
Aunt Sarah, you don't know
what you're saying!

581
00:39:38,376 --> 00:39:41,174
Roger, I want you to get out of here
and stay out.

582
00:39:41,312 --> 00:39:45,942
- You forget that I am over 21.
- You forget I control your finances.

583
00:39:46,083 --> 00:39:49,917
I won't allow any Broadway gold digger
to get your money if I can help it.

584
00:39:50,054 --> 00:39:51,988
Stand aside.

585
00:39:52,123 --> 00:39:54,591
Did she mean me?

586
00:39:54,725 --> 00:39:58,684
No, I don't think so, Betsy.

587
00:39:58,863 --> 00:40:00,956
I don't know what
she's talking about...

588
00:40:01,132 --> 00:40:04,067
but I'll bet she's going to
make trouble for us.

589
00:40:06,303 --> 00:40:09,466
- Yes, I'm ringing him, mister.
- Flossie?

590
00:40:09,607 --> 00:40:11,541
Just a minute.

591
00:40:11,675 --> 00:40:15,805
Flossie, there's something
I've been wanting to ask you.

592
00:40:15,946 --> 00:40:19,313
- Yes?
- A man gets lonesome knocking...

593
00:40:19,450 --> 00:40:22,908
around with no one to talk to
but a five-piece orchestra...

594
00:40:23,053 --> 00:40:25,681
- and living in a...
- Hotel Variety.

595
00:40:25,823 --> 00:40:27,757
That's right.

596
00:40:27,892 --> 00:40:30,918
I was wondering, if I asked
a certain girl to marry me...

597
00:40:31,095 --> 00:40:35,498
- what would she say?
- You're on a busy line, stupid.

598
00:40:37,568 --> 00:40:42,369
- Go ahead.
- I withdraw the question.

599
00:40:42,506 --> 00:40:46,602
- I want to see Mr. Shea. Is he around?
- Somebody calling me?

600
00:40:49,346 --> 00:40:51,280
The law.

601
00:40:51,415 --> 00:40:54,475
Yes, sir.
What can I do for you?

602
00:40:56,554 --> 00:40:59,717
- What's this?
- What's the matter, Pop?

603
00:41:01,792 --> 00:41:04,522
It's for Betsy.

604
00:41:04,695 --> 00:41:06,629
Now, if you could come around
tomorrow morning...

605
00:41:06,764 --> 00:41:08,857
Sorry. I don't like this
any more than you.

606
00:41:09,033 --> 00:41:12,594
But I got to take her
back tonight.

607
00:41:12,736 --> 00:41:16,570
Look here, Officer, you can't take Betsy
back to the orphan asylum.

608
00:41:16,707 --> 00:41:21,610
You know why? 'Cause Betsy isn’t here.
She's down south in dear old Dixie.

609
00:41:21,745 --> 00:41:24,441
Sure. Visiting with my folks.

610
00:41:24,582 --> 00:41:26,709
#I wish I was in Dixie#

611
00:41:26,851 --> 00:41:28,944
#Away, away#

612
00:41:29,086 --> 00:41:31,816
- Hey, are you crazy?
- Yeah. No!

613
00:41:31,956 --> 00:41:34,049
You see, we don't want to lose Betsy.

614
00:41:34,191 --> 00:41:36,989
That's why I lied to you.
She's up in her room.

615
00:41:37,161 --> 00:41:39,755
- What's the number?
- 220.

616
00:41:39,930 --> 00:41:42,398
I'll go and get her.

617
00:41:56,013 --> 00:41:58,140
- But where are we going to take her?
- Over to my house.

618
00:41:58,282 --> 00:42:00,147
Your house? Impossible.

619
00:42:00,284 --> 00:42:02,115
I don't think Miss Wendling
likes me very well.

620
00:42:02,253 --> 00:42:04,949
She'll never know. She's gone to Newport
and won't be back for a month.

621
00:42:05,089 --> 00:42:07,319
I guess they'd never think
of looking for her there.

622
00:42:07,458 --> 00:42:11,019
No. Come on, Betsy.
Upsy-daisy.

623
00:42:13,497 --> 00:42:15,988
Hang on tight now.
Hold her, Barbara.

624
00:42:16,166 --> 00:42:20,364
Yeah. I got her.

625
00:42:20,504 --> 00:42:23,200
- There you are.
- Thanks an awful lot.

626
00:42:23,340 --> 00:42:25,638
Will you and Pop and everybody
come over to see me?

627
00:42:25,776 --> 00:42:29,177
- You bet we will. Good night, darling.
- Good night.

628
00:42:34,184 --> 00:42:37,381
Come on, Betsy.

629
00:42:37,521 --> 00:42:39,489
- Good night.
- Good night, darling.

630
00:42:39,623 --> 00:42:42,456
Good night.

631
00:42:42,626 --> 00:42:44,890
Good night, darling.

632
00:42:47,665 --> 00:42:50,759
Don't cry, Betsy.
They can't do this to us.

633
00:42:50,901 --> 00:42:54,997
We'll take it up to the Supreme Court,
to Washington, to Lincoln.

634
00:42:55,139 --> 00:42:57,664
Officer,
take your prisoner.

635
00:42:57,808 --> 00:43:01,869
- I'm sorry, old boy.
- I know. Just doing your duty.

636
00:43:02,012 --> 00:43:05,709
Now run along
before I give vent to my emotions.

637
00:43:13,123 --> 00:43:15,956
Say, where are you going
with my wife?

638
00:43:16,126 --> 00:43:19,061
- What do you mean, your wife?
- You keep away from my wife...

639
00:43:19,229 --> 00:43:21,925
or I'll smack you
down to my size.

640
00:43:30,140 --> 00:43:35,168
- But I only did it to help Betsy.
- Ah!

641
00:43:35,312 --> 00:43:37,212
Ah, Georgie, listen to me.

642
00:43:37,348 --> 00:43:40,784
Now don't be sore.
We had to help little Betsy.

643
00:44:01,905 --> 00:44:05,397
What's the matter, darling?
Something wrong?

644
00:44:05,542 --> 00:44:07,510
No, nothing,
Uncle Willoughby.

645
00:44:07,645 --> 00:44:10,011
- Only...
- Only what?

646
00:44:10,147 --> 00:44:13,674
Couldn't I go over to the hotel
for just a few minutes?

647
00:44:13,817 --> 00:44:18,083
Oh, no, dear, no. There's been a detective
over there every day this week.

648
00:44:18,222 --> 00:44:21,123
Now you just be patient
a little longer.

649
00:44:21,258 --> 00:44:25,661
But I was sure someone would come over...
especially today.

650
00:44:25,796 --> 00:44:29,288
Why?
What's today?

651
00:44:29,466 --> 00:44:32,060
Come on. Tell me.

652
00:44:32,202 --> 00:44:34,568
It's my birthday.

653
00:44:34,705 --> 00:44:38,106
Your birthday.
My, my.

654
00:44:38,242 --> 00:44:41,803
At the orphanage, they always had
a birthday cake for me.

655
00:44:41,945 --> 00:44:46,006
Well, Pop and Barbara have been very busy,
but we'll make up for it.

656
00:44:46,150 --> 00:44:48,744
Come on. Let's go
downstairs, huh?

657
00:44:52,222 --> 00:44:54,747
You won't miss just
one birthday party.

658
00:44:54,892 --> 00:45:00,228
You'll have so many more birthdays
and so many more parties.

659
00:45:00,297 --> 00:45:02,561
How about some cookies?

660
00:45:02,700 --> 00:45:05,794
But it just doesn't seem
like a birthday at all.

661
00:45:05,936 --> 00:45:09,770
Well, when the detectives stop
hanging around in another week or so...

662
00:45:09,907 --> 00:45:13,638
maybe we can sneak over to the hotel
and have a fine big party.

663
00:45:13,777 --> 00:45:14,607
What do you say?

664
00:45:14,812 --> 00:45:15,904
What do you say?

665
00:45:16,046 --> 00:45:21,450
Oh, dear. I haven't even wished you
a happy birthday myself.

666
00:45:21,585 --> 00:45:23,644
Happy birthday!

667
00:45:23,787 --> 00:45:26,585
#Happy birthday to you#

668
00:45:26,724 --> 00:45:29,284
#Happy birthday to you#

669
00:45:29,460 --> 00:45:32,987
# Happy birthday, dear Betsy #

670
00:45:33,163 --> 00:45:36,291
- #Happy birthday to you#
- Speech! Speech!

671
00:45:36,433 --> 00:45:39,368
Congratulations!

672
00:45:39,536 --> 00:45:42,664
Speech! Speech!

673
00:45:42,806 --> 00:45:45,832
How can I thank you?

674
00:45:45,976 --> 00:45:49,002
How do I start?

675
00:45:49,146 --> 00:45:51,979
#The words are somewhere#

676
00:45:52,116 --> 00:45:54,243
#Around my heart#

677
00:45:55,552 --> 00:45:58,077
#If I could say#

678
00:45:58,222 --> 00:46:02,124
# n a word or two#

679
00:46:02,259 --> 00:46:04,284
#How much it means#

680
00:46:04,461 --> 00:46:09,194
#To be loved by you#

681
00:46:09,333 --> 00:46:12,666
#Then I could thank you#

682
00:46:12,803 --> 00:46:15,897
#For all you've done#

683
00:46:16,039 --> 00:46:19,736
#But I don't know
what to do#

684
00:46:23,013 --> 00:46:25,140
#What can you say#

685
00:46:25,282 --> 00:46:30,549
#When a dream comes true#

686
00:46:30,687 --> 00:46:33,087
#How can I ever...#

687
00:46:38,328 --> 00:46:42,094
Betsy, darling.
This is no time for tears.

688
00:46:42,232 --> 00:46:44,166
This is your birthday.

689
00:46:44,334 --> 00:46:46,894
On behalf of the hoi polloi
gathered here...

690
00:46:47,037 --> 00:46:50,404
I just want to say
many happy returns...

691
00:46:50,541 --> 00:46:53,339
- and when do we eat?
- Yeah!

692
00:46:54,545 --> 00:46:57,708
Now!

693
00:47:01,652 --> 00:47:04,485
It's the big parade.

694
00:47:04,621 --> 00:47:07,954
What a joint!
What a joint.

695
00:47:32,249 --> 00:47:35,218
Oh, thank you.
That... that's very nice of you.

696
00:47:35,419 --> 00:47:39,321
- Good blow!
- Happy birthday!

697
00:47:39,456 --> 00:47:41,924
- Cut the cake, Betsy! Cut the cake.
- Yes, come on.

698
00:47:42,059 --> 00:47:46,962
Oh, my goodness.

699
00:47:47,097 --> 00:47:50,498
Get out. Get out,
all of you!

700
00:47:57,474 --> 00:47:59,442
You call this
hospitality?

701
00:47:59,576 --> 00:48:01,942
I'll take it up
with Emily Post.

702
00:48:03,280 --> 00:48:05,214
Where are you taking that child?

703
00:48:05,349 --> 00:48:07,283
Where do you suppose?
I'm taking her home!

704
00:48:07,417 --> 00:48:09,442
- Officer!
- See here, Sarah!

705
00:48:09,586 --> 00:48:11,986
You keep out of this,
you Judas.

706
00:48:12,122 --> 00:48:14,522
There's the child
you're after.

707
00:48:16,159 --> 00:48:18,821
- You let her alone! Come, Betsy.
- Just a minute.

708
00:48:18,996 --> 00:48:22,056
Don't you hurt Pop!
Don't you dare hurt Pop!

709
00:48:22,232 --> 00:48:24,166
We're not going
to hurt anyone.

710
00:48:24,301 --> 00:48:26,292
No need in getting excited.
We've got orders.

711
00:48:26,436 --> 00:48:28,836
No, no!
I want to stay with Pop!

712
00:48:28,972 --> 00:48:31,304
Well, I don't blame you.
You just come along now...

713
00:48:31,441 --> 00:48:33,500
and your pop can straighten
things out later.

714
00:48:33,644 --> 00:48:36,340
I'm afraid you'll have
to go with him, Betsy.

715
00:48:36,480 --> 00:48:41,144
But I don't want to go to the orphanage.
I want to stay with you.

716
00:48:41,285 --> 00:48:43,845
Don't cry, darling.

717
00:48:43,987 --> 00:48:46,217
I'll come and see you,
and I'll...

718
00:48:46,356 --> 00:48:49,120
I'll get you out again.

719
00:49:04,508 --> 00:49:07,875
You mean old pumpkin!

720
00:49:08,011 --> 00:49:10,775
Good-bye, Pop.

721
00:49:10,914 --> 00:49:12,848
Good-bye, Betsy.

722
00:49:12,983 --> 00:49:17,352
One, two, three, four, five, six, seven.

723
00:49:21,658 --> 00:49:27,096
I wish you were a man
for about five minutes.

724
00:49:35,539 --> 00:49:38,406
Now, Sarah!
You listen to me.

725
00:49:38,542 --> 00:49:40,874
I suppose if Simmons
hadn't warned me in time...

726
00:49:41,011 --> 00:49:43,445
you probably would have
had all these freaks living here.

727
00:49:43,580 --> 00:49:46,947
Well, it was the child's birthday,
and people just happened to drop in.

728
00:49:47,084 --> 00:49:49,746
A likely story.
Where's Roger?

729
00:49:49,886 --> 00:49:52,047
- Out with that scheming
Shea girl, I suppose.
- No!

730
00:49:52,189 --> 00:49:55,522
- On the contrary, he's...
- #Happy birthday...#

731
00:49:55,692 --> 00:49:58,923
Well, uh, what kind
of a birthday party is this?

732
00:49:59,096 --> 00:50:01,030
You're a little late,
aren't you?

733
00:50:01,198 --> 00:50:03,393
Where is everyone?
Where's Betsy?

734
00:50:03,533 --> 00:50:07,060
On her way to the orphan asylum,
where she'll be among decent people...

735
00:50:07,204 --> 00:50:09,729
- Come on, Barbara.
- Wait! Young lady!

736
00:50:09,873 --> 00:50:11,966
You can give your father a message:
He's being dispossessed.

737
00:50:12,109 --> 00:50:13,974
- You can't!
- I'm tearing the hotel down.

738
00:50:14,111 --> 00:50:15,976
He's paid his rent.

739
00:50:16,113 --> 00:50:17,978
He's violated his lease by
having all sorts of animals.

740
00:50:18,115 --> 00:50:20,345
He'll save himself a lot of
trouble by getting right out.

741
00:50:20,484 --> 00:50:22,975
- I'll have something to say about that.
- I'm afraid not...

742
00:50:23,120 --> 00:50:25,088
as our attorney
will inform you.

743
00:50:25,222 --> 00:50:28,953
Furthermore, I warn you, if you continue
your association with this woman...

744
00:50:29,126 --> 00:50:32,152
Continue it? I've been trying to get her
to make it permanent.

745
00:50:32,329 --> 00:50:35,765
- Come on, Barbara.
- Roger, wait!

746
00:50:35,932 --> 00:50:37,866
Roger!

747
00:50:49,980 --> 00:50:53,245
Snitcher!

748
00:51:06,296 --> 00:51:08,628
It really isn't
so very nice out there.

749
00:51:08,765 --> 00:51:12,166
There's practically no one to play with...
just grown-ups.

750
00:51:12,335 --> 00:51:14,860
- And you know how tiresome they can be.
- Yeah.

751
00:51:15,005 --> 00:51:18,065
Didn't you have
any fun at all?

752
00:51:18,208 --> 00:51:23,339
Well, it was fun singing
with Uncle Willoughby's quartet.

753
00:51:23,480 --> 00:51:26,677
And Jimmy was
awfully good to me.

754
00:51:26,817 --> 00:51:28,751
And Pop and...

755
00:51:28,885 --> 00:51:32,184
and Barbara.

756
00:51:32,322 --> 00:51:35,689
Aw, come on.
It's not so bad here.

757
00:51:35,826 --> 00:51:38,590
No! It's not!

758
00:51:38,762 --> 00:51:42,391
It's no use crying about it.
Remember what you used to tell us?

759
00:51:42,566 --> 00:51:46,297
- To be optimistic?
- Don't be a grumpy.

760
00:51:46,436 --> 00:51:48,927
And when the road gets bumpy,
just smile.

761
00:51:49,072 --> 00:51:52,439
Your troubles can't be
as bad as all that.

762
00:51:52,576 --> 00:51:56,535
- And when you're sad as all that...
- Nobody loves you.

763
00:52:04,955 --> 00:52:07,048
#Be optimistic#

764
00:52:07,190 --> 00:52:09,317
#Don't you be a grumpy#

765
00:52:09,493 --> 00:52:12,223
#When the road gets bumpy
just smile#

766
00:52:12,395 --> 00:52:14,329
#Smile and be happy#

767
00:52:14,498 --> 00:52:17,524
#Your troubles can't be
as bad as all that#

768
00:52:17,701 --> 00:52:19,794
#When you're sad as all that#

769
00:52:19,936 --> 00:52:23,201
#No one loves you#

770
00:52:23,340 --> 00:52:25,467
#Be optimistic#

771
00:52:25,609 --> 00:52:27,577
#Don't you be a mourner#

772
00:52:27,711 --> 00:52:29,645
#Brighten up that corner#

773
00:52:29,779 --> 00:52:32,441
- #And smile#
- #Smile#
- #Smile#

774
00:52:32,582 --> 00:52:36,985
#Don't wear a long face
it's never in style#

775
00:52:37,120 --> 00:52:41,454
#Be optimistic and smile#

776
00:52:43,560 --> 00:52:46,996
It's my property and my money
just as much as it's hers...

777
00:52:47,164 --> 00:52:49,155
and trustee or no trustee,
she's got to give it to me.

778
00:52:49,332 --> 00:52:52,324
- What did you ask her?
- I asked her for the hotel and $50,000...

779
00:52:52,502 --> 00:52:55,027
just enough to rent
a theater and back a show...

780
00:52:55,172 --> 00:52:57,538
to give those poor devils
a chance to earn a living.

781
00:52:57,674 --> 00:53:00,199
- You'll never get it.
- But I've got to get it!

782
00:53:00,277 --> 00:53:03,440
Mr. Fiske, you're a lawyer.
Tell me. What can I do?

783
00:53:03,580 --> 00:53:06,378
Don't get me in this. I don't want
to get tangled with Sarah Wendling.

784
00:53:06,516 --> 00:53:08,984
- Me either.
- I'm just asking for advice.

785
00:53:09,119 --> 00:53:12,646
- I'd rather not ha
anything to do with it.
- You can't fight Sarah Wendling.

786
00:53:12,789 --> 00:53:16,657
Very well, gentlemen. Then we'll
just allow these people to starve.

787
00:53:16,826 --> 00:53:18,726
People that you all
know and admire.

788
00:53:18,862 --> 00:53:22,628
And don't forget, you're just a bunch
of ham actors yourselves.

789
00:53:22,766 --> 00:53:25,667
Gentlemen, I'm surprised
that you'd sit here...

790
00:53:25,802 --> 00:53:27,667
and make beggars and panhandlers
out of the same artists...

791
00:53:27,804 --> 00:53:29,669
that you used to applaud...

792
00:53:29,806 --> 00:53:33,003
to think you'd allow Sarah, just
to satisfy some simple whim of hers...

793
00:53:33,143 --> 00:53:36,237
to tear the roof from over their heads,
to turn them out in the streets

794
00:53:36,379 --> 00:53:38,472
- You can stop her!
- How?

795
00:53:38,615 --> 00:53:41,482
By getting out a temporary injunction
restraining her.

796
00:53:41,618 --> 00:53:44,314
You're a part owner.
I'm not advising you!

797
00:53:44,454 --> 00:53:46,649
No, no advice.
But what do I do then?

798
00:53:46,790 --> 00:53:49,315
- Let me alone, Roger!
- There's no harm in telling him.

799
00:53:49,459 --> 00:53:52,656
- Come on, Mr. Fiske.
- Well, you could bring a court action...

800
00:53:52,829 --> 00:53:57,562
compelling Sarah to turn over your portion
of the estate, including the hotel.

801
00:53:57,701 --> 00:54:00,568
But understand now,
it's just a chance...

802
00:54:00,704 --> 00:54:03,639
and I don't want to have
anything to do with it, no.

803
00:54:03,773 --> 00:54:08,005
Because you're afraid of that
bullying sister of mine. Well, I'm not.

804
00:54:08,144 --> 00:54:10,578
- Roger, I'm with you.
- Good for you, Uncle Willoughby.

805
00:54:10,714 --> 00:54:12,579
- And you're going to take the case.
- No!

806
00:54:12,716 --> 00:54:14,581
- Yes!
- No!

807
00:54:14,718 --> 00:54:17,551
Yes! Now hurry up
and get out that injunction...

808
00:54:17,687 --> 00:54:19,780
or I'll throw you
out of the quartet...

809
00:54:19,923 --> 00:54:23,381
you, you
off-key baritone.

810
00:54:25,762 --> 00:54:27,627
Here's the mail and
newspaper, Miss Hutchins.

811
00:54:27,764 --> 00:54:29,629
Oh, thank you, darling.

812
00:54:29,766 --> 00:54:33,099
- Read me the funnies.
- No, after dinner, when you
and the other children...

813
00:54:33,236 --> 00:54:37,036
Please, Miss Hutchins.
Please read me the funnies.

814
00:54:37,173 --> 00:54:39,607
All right. Come on.

815
00:54:41,911 --> 00:54:46,075
Oh, look! It's Roger,
and that's Miss Wendling.

816
00:54:46,216 --> 00:54:48,878
What does it say?
Please read it to me.

817
00:54:49,019 --> 00:54:52,079
''Trial of Roger Wendling's
action against his Aunt Sarah...

818
00:54:52,222 --> 00:54:54,656
''for the petition
of the Wendling Estate...

819
00:54:54,791 --> 00:54:57,885
''was begun to day before Judge Hart
in surrogate court.

820
00:54:58,061 --> 00:55:00,655
''The young millionaire's action
against his eccentric aunt...

821
00:55:00,830 --> 00:55:05,096
“was occasioned by her threat
to tear down the Hotel Variety.

822
00:55:05,235 --> 00:55:09,262
This was temporarily
prevented by an injunction.”

823
00:55:09,406 --> 00:55:12,204
She wants to tear down
the hotel?

824
00:55:12,342 --> 00:55:15,778
- So it seems.
- What'll happen to Pop and Barbara?

825
00:55:15,912 --> 00:55:19,211
Oh, now, now, don't you worry.
Everything's going to be all right.

826
00:55:19,349 --> 00:55:23,115
- That old pumpkin! I'd like to...
- Uh-uh-uh-uh-uh!

827
00:55:24,688 --> 00:55:25,422
Come on. Get some more.
Come on. Hurry.

828
00:55:25,422 --> 00:55:28,589
Come on. Get some more.
Come on. Hurry.

829
00:55:30,226 --> 00:55:33,320
- Aren't you afraid, Betsy?
- You might fall and hurt yourself.

830
00:55:33,496 --> 00:55:35,555
Oh, please
don't do it, Betsy.

831
00:55:35,732 --> 00:55:39,327
I've got to get to Pop. He's in trouble,
and I've gotta be with him.

832
00:55:39,469 --> 00:55:43,132
- Is it tight enough?
- Uh-huh.

833
00:55:43,273 --> 00:55:47,209
- All right. Bye.
- Bye.

834
00:55:47,344 --> 00:55:50,006
But what'll we tell
the matron?

835
00:55:50,146 --> 00:55:54,105
Uh, tell her I've gone
out west to fight Indians.

836
00:56:05,295 --> 00:56:07,456
Be awfully careful, Betsy.

837
00:56:13,103 --> 00:56:17,699
- [ All ] Bye. Bye.
- Shh.

838
00:56:26,015 --> 00:56:28,711
- What's your name?
- Betsy. What's yours?

839
00:56:28,852 --> 00:56:31,184
Harry.
Where are you going?

840
00:56:31,321 --> 00:56:34,051
- Home.
- Where's home?

841
00:56:34,190 --> 00:56:36,317
New York,
on 49th Street.

842
00:56:36,493 --> 00:56:39,553
That's a million miles from here.

843
00:56:39,729 --> 00:56:43,529
- I am not going that far.
- Take me as far as you go?

844
00:56:43,666 --> 00:56:48,035
All right. How come
you got way out here?

845
00:56:48,171 --> 00:56:53,939
You see, last night I was riding
home with my dad in his car.

846
00:56:54,077 --> 00:56:56,341
He was driving awfully fast...

847
00:56:56,479 --> 00:57:00,006
and all of a sudden
he hit a bump in the road...

848
00:57:00,150 --> 00:57:02,277
and I bounced
right out of the car.

849
00:57:02,419 --> 00:57:04,546
- And he didn't know it?
- No.

850
00:57:04,687 --> 00:57:08,987
What a dope.
You got to get off at the next corner.

851
00:57:09,125 --> 00:57:13,027
If I could get to a subway,
it would almost get me home.

852
00:57:13,163 --> 00:57:15,597
If... if I had a nickel.

853
00:57:20,236 --> 00:57:23,672
Thanks a lot for the ride.
I appreciate it very much.

854
00:57:25,575 --> 00:57:27,907
- Bye.
- So long.

855
00:57:28,044 --> 00:57:30,638
Come on! Get off!

856
00:57:32,982 --> 00:57:37,043
Well, here's a nickel.

857
00:57:37,187 --> 00:57:40,918
- Oh, thanks.
- Come on, will ya? Scram! Get off!.

858
00:57:41,057 --> 00:57:43,855
How far is it
to the subway station?

859
00:57:44,027 --> 00:57:47,485
Six blocks, and
I am not going that way!

860
00:57:49,098 --> 00:57:52,556
Please take me
to the subway station.

861
00:57:52,735 --> 00:57:54,965
Oh, all right.

862
00:58:00,376 --> 00:58:03,243
You dames are all alike.

863
00:58:04,681 --> 00:58:06,842
Your witness, Mr. Barron.

864
00:58:09,385 --> 00:58:12,218
Mr. Wendling, isn't it true
that you intend to use this money...

865
00:58:12,355 --> 00:58:14,346
to put on a vaudeville show?

866
00:58:14,491 --> 00:58:16,425
A small portion of it,
yes, sir.

867
00:58:16,559 --> 00:58:20,689
And you intend to put this show on
with actors living at the Hotel Variety?

868
00:58:20,864 --> 00:58:23,560
- That's right.
- Isn't it quite probable...

869
00:58:23,700 --> 00:58:27,727
that this vaudeville venture
of yours may prove a failure?

870
00:58:27,871 --> 00:58:31,637
Or, in the Broadway
vernacular, a flop?

871
00:58:31,774 --> 00:58:36,177
What? With me and
the band? I object!

872
00:58:36,312 --> 00:58:40,112
Order! Order in the court!

873
00:58:40,250 --> 00:58:44,914
Do my eyes believe me?
That's Betsy. Oh, I'm so glad to see you.

874
00:58:45,054 --> 00:58:47,249
I'm glad to see you,
but where is everybody?

875
00:58:47,390 --> 00:58:49,255
They're over in the courthouse.

876
00:58:49,392 --> 00:58:53,021
- Why aren't you there?
- You see, the crowds make Oscar nervous.

877
00:58:53,196 --> 00:58:56,165
I've got to get to the trial, Ole.
You've got to take me.

878
00:58:56,332 --> 00:58:59,392
Please, I want to be with Pop.
You must take me there, Ole.

879
00:58:59,536 --> 00:59:02,471
Well, all right.
Come on, Oscar. Got to go.

880
00:59:04,240 --> 00:59:08,176
Miss Wendling, do you
know William J. Shea?

881
00:59:08,311 --> 00:59:10,279
I do.

882
00:59:10,413 --> 00:59:13,246
Have you ever seen your nephew
in the company of Barbara Shea?

883
00:59:13,416 --> 00:59:15,611
I object!

884
00:59:15,752 --> 00:59:19,779
They told me they would be in here.
There's Pop, and there's Barbara!

885
00:59:24,160 --> 00:59:27,095
Order.! Order in the court!

886
00:59:28,698 --> 00:59:31,030
Well, I rode on bicycles...

887
00:59:31,167 --> 00:59:36,969
Order! Order in the...

888
00:59:44,514 --> 00:59:47,074
Go on to the case, please.

889
00:59:47,216 --> 00:59:52,313
Has your nephew ever asked you for money
for any business ventures of any kind?

890
00:59:52,455 --> 00:59:55,424
- Only once, about two weeks ago.
- Did you give it to him?

891
00:59:55,558 --> 00:59:57,526
- I did not.
- Why?

892
00:59:57,694 --> 01:00:02,188
Because he wanted to throw it away
on worthless, good-for-nothing actors.

893
01:00:02,365 --> 01:00:04,230
They are not good-for-nothing!

894
01:00:04,367 --> 01:00:06,232
They're the nicest people
in the whole world!

895
01:00:06,369 --> 01:00:10,897
You said it, Bets. Your Honor, I object
to the lady's incinerations.

896
01:00:11,040 --> 01:00:14,203
It's irrelephant, immemorial
and a bare-faced lie.

897
01:00:16,412 --> 01:00:20,314
If there's any more of this,
I'll clear the courtroom.

898
01:00:20,450 --> 01:00:23,442
Your Honor, that child
belongs in an orphanage.

899
01:00:23,586 --> 01:00:26,646
I put her there myself.
Those scoundrels have kidnapped her.

900
01:00:26,789 --> 01:00:30,122
I came here all by myself!.

901
01:00:30,293 --> 01:00:32,887
That's another fib
you told, Miss Wendling.

902
01:00:33,062 --> 01:00:36,190
Bring that youngster up here.

903
01:00:44,007 --> 01:00:47,670
Young lady, do you realize you're guilty
of contempt of court?

904
01:00:47,810 --> 01:00:50,938
I'm awfully sorry,
but it just made me mad...

905
01:00:51,080 --> 01:00:53,605
to hear Miss Wendling say those
mean things about my friends...

906
01:00:53,750 --> 01:00:55,684
'cause they aren't true.

907
01:00:55,818 --> 01:00:58,981
Honest, Mr. Judge,
they're wonderful actors.

908
01:00:59,122 --> 01:01:00,987
Just wonderful!

909
01:01:01,124 --> 01:01:04,457
This young lady doesn't seem to agree
with you, Miss Wendling.

910
01:01:04,627 --> 01:01:08,461
But she never saw them act.
Did you, Miss Wendling?

911
01:01:08,598 --> 01:01:10,589
And if you saw them act, Mr. Judge...

912
01:01:10,767 --> 01:01:13,463
if you saw Jimmy
and his band and everybody...

913
01:01:13,603 --> 01:01:17,164
oh, I know you'd think
they were wonderful too.

914
01:01:17,306 --> 01:01:19,968
- If it please the court, I'd like to...
- Just a minute.

915
01:01:20,109 --> 01:01:24,341
I believe this court can be saved
a lot of time and argument...

916
01:01:24,480 --> 01:01:28,678
by following the splendid suggestion
that has just been made.

917
01:01:28,818 --> 01:01:31,480
It appears the immediate
issue in this case...

918
01:01:31,621 --> 01:01:36,684
is whether or not the plaintiff s proposal
to invest his money is a sound one.

919
01:01:36,826 --> 01:01:38,794
Your Honor
doesn't mean that...

920
01:01:38,961 --> 01:01:43,159
I mean that I want to see
this show right here
in this courtroom tomorrow.

921
01:01:43,299 --> 01:01:45,494
Court adjourned!

922
01:01:45,635 --> 01:01:49,833
You were swell!

923
01:02:08,991 --> 01:02:12,654
Yeah, yeah, start your show.

924
01:02:12,829 --> 01:02:16,265
I mean, uh, present
your evidence, please.

925
01:02:37,353 --> 01:02:41,050
#Your Honor
I lay my case before you#

926
01:02:41,190 --> 01:02:45,183
#With a show you're invited
now to see with me#

927
01:02:45,361 --> 01:02:49,764
#It's a wow one, I hope
that you'll agree with me#

928
01:02:49,932 --> 01:02:52,366
#Their business
show business#

929
01:02:52,535 --> 01:02:56,266
#Just comes to no business
without backing#

930
01:02:56,405 --> 01:02:58,498
#That's all they're lacking#

931
01:02:58,641 --> 01:03:01,235
#All they need is a chance#

932
01:03:01,377 --> 01:03:05,438
#A chance to smile
to laugh, to sing, to dance#

933
01:03:05,581 --> 01:03:07,845
#And that is that#

934
01:03:07,984 --> 01:03:10,077
#And that is all#

935
01:03:10,219 --> 01:03:13,780
#So thank you
for the use of the hall#

936
01:03:15,892 --> 01:03:18,452
O-Order! Order!

937
01:03:21,297 --> 01:03:25,563
You may proceed.
I-Is your evidence ready?

938
01:03:25,701 --> 01:03:29,398
My first evidence,
Your Honor, exhibit “A.”

939
01:03:29,539 --> 01:03:34,943
#Oh, ye'll take the high road
and I'll take the low road#

940
01:03:35,077 --> 01:03:40,014
#And I'll be in Scotland
afore ye#

941
01:03:40,149 --> 01:03:43,277
#But me and my true love#

942
01:03:43,419 --> 01:03:48,254
#Will never meet again#

943
01:03:48,391 --> 01:03:51,758
#On the bonny, bonny#

944
01:04:05,074 --> 01:04:09,636
Don't stop singing, gentlemen.
Won't you sing a song for me?

945
01:04:09,779 --> 01:04:14,079
#I'm afraid you wouldn't like
the old-time numbers that we sing#

946
01:04:14,217 --> 01:04:17,653
- Why?
- #People don't like them nowadays#

947
01:04:17,787 --> 01:04:20,585
#All they want to do
is swing#

948
01:04:20,723 --> 01:04:25,683
Well, why don't you take an old song
and swing it? How would that be?

949
01:04:25,862 --> 01:04:27,796
#But how do we do it#

950
01:04:27,964 --> 01:04:31,559
There's nothing to it.
#Just follow me#

951
01:04:31,701 --> 01:04:34,499
#First of all
you start to sway#

952
01:04:34,637 --> 01:04:36,969
#Back and forth
That's the way#

953
01:04:37,106 --> 01:04:39,836
#And now that you've
got yourself swinging#

954
01:04:39,976 --> 01:04:42,206
#Do the same thing
with your singing#

955
01:04:42,345 --> 01:04:46,076
#Swing me
an old-fashioned song#

956
01:04:46,215 --> 01:04:51,175
#Down by the old mill stream#

957
01:04:51,320 --> 01:04:55,723
#Da-da-dee-da-da, swing me
an old-fashioned song#

958
01:04:55,858 --> 01:04:58,520
#Old-fashioned song#

959
01:04:58,694 --> 01:05:02,858
#Croon me an old-fashioned tune
Da-da-da-da-da#

960
01:05:02,999 --> 01:05:05,797
#In the evening
by the moonlight#

961
01:05:05,935 --> 01:05:09,029
#You can hear
those darkies singing#

962
01:05:09,171 --> 01:05:12,834
- #Oh, croon me an old-fashioned tune#
- #Won't you croon a tune#

963
01:05:12,975 --> 01:05:18,208
#Just keep it soft and sweet
with rhythm from the start#

964
01:05:18,347 --> 01:05:20,645
#But keep that
old-time beat#

965
01:05:20,783 --> 01:05:24,651
#The beat that's
straight from the heart#

966
01:05:24,787 --> 01:05:28,917
#Swing me
an old-fashioned song#

967
01:05:29,058 --> 01:05:33,961
#I wandered today
through the hills, Maggie#

968
01:05:34,096 --> 01:05:38,032
#That's it, it's just
an old-fashioned song#

969
01:05:42,071 --> 01:05:47,771
#Dear old girl, the robins
sing about you#

970
01:05:47,910 --> 01:05:51,311
- #Rah#
- #Dee-rah-dee-rah, rah, rah#

971
01:05:51,447 --> 01:05:53,574
Won't you try it?

972
01:05:53,716 --> 01:05:58,710
#Oh, my darling
Oh, my darling, darling#

973
01:05:58,854 --> 01:06:02,381
#Croon me
an old-fashioned tune#

974
01:06:02,525 --> 01:06:05,460
#Just keep it
soft and sweet#

975
01:06:05,594 --> 01:06:08,085
#With rhythm
from the start#

976
01:06:08,264 --> 01:06:10,960
#But keep that
old-time beat#

977
01:06:11,100 --> 01:06:14,228
#The beat that's
straight from the heart#

978
01:06:14,370 --> 01:06:19,171
#Won't you swing us
an old-fashioned song#

979
01:06:19,375 --> 01:06:24,369
#Ye'll take the high road
and I'll take the low road#

980
01:06:24,513 --> 01:06:29,075
#And I'll be in Scotland
afore ye#

981
01:06:29,218 --> 01:06:31,982
#That's how to swing#

982
01:06:32,121 --> 01:06:34,453
#An old-fashioned song#

983
01:06:34,590 --> 01:06:39,493
#Now sing and you'll
be happy all day long #

984
01:06:39,628 --> 01:06:44,998
# Sing an old-fashioned song#

985
01:06:45,134 --> 01:06:48,001
Yeah!

986
01:06:53,743 --> 01:06:56,234
Order! Order! Order!

987
01:06:58,647 --> 01:07:01,878
Proceed, please.

988
01:07:02,051 --> 01:07:05,953
Your Honor,
mark it exhibit “B.”

989
01:07:22,905 --> 01:07:26,306
#Little Miss Broadway
is going to town#

990
01:07:26,442 --> 01:07:30,640
#The toast of old Broadway
uptown and down#

991
01:07:30,780 --> 01:07:34,614
#Queen of them all
with a smile for a crown#

992
01:07:34,750 --> 01:07:38,516
#Her two little feet
on that fabulous street#

993
01:07:38,654 --> 01:07:42,385
#Are the talk of the crowd
Every one of them proud#

994
01:07:42,525 --> 01:07:46,723
#Of Little Miss Broadway
up on her toes#

995
01:07:46,896 --> 01:07:50,662
#With music and laughter
wherever she goes#

996
01:07:50,800 --> 01:07:54,861
#Everyone loves her
and everyone knows#

997
01:07:55,004 --> 01:07:58,462
#She's captured Manhattan
from Harlem to Staten#

998
01:07:58,607 --> 01:08:00,404
#And thousands applaud#

999
01:08:00,543 --> 01:08:04,843
#Little Miss Broadway#

1000
01:08:09,151 --> 01:08:11,346
#I'm here and you're here#

1001

01:08:14,590 --> 01:08:17,024

#You're here and I'm here#

1004

#We're marching down here #

1005
01:08:23,165 --> 01:08:26,362
# But where is Broadway #

1006
01:08:26,502 --> 01:08:31,166
#Broadway is not
what it used to be#

1007
01:08:31,307 --> 01:08:35,403
#We need a new street
a just-for-you street#

1008
01:08:35,544 --> 01:08:37,739
#And just for fun#

1009

#I'll show you
how it's done#

1010

#I'll build
a Broadway for you#

1011

#We'll trade the old
for the new#

1012
01:08:56,565 --> 01:09:01,559
#I'll make you famous
in old Times Square#

1013
01:09:01,704 --> 01:09:05,731
#I'll have your name
in neon shining there#

1014
01:09:05,875 --> 01:09:09,777
#You'll be their
favorite child#

1015

#You'll have the crowds
going wild#

#I'll build a dream street
where wishes come true#

1017
01:09:21,423 --> 01:09:26,122
#I'll build a Broadway
for you#

1018
01:09:54,256 --> 01:09:58,249
#Little Miss Broadway up on her toes#

#Ahh#

1027
01:10:26,689 --> 01:10:29,385
Bravo! Bravo!

1028
01:10:29,525 --> 01:10:32,323
That's good. That's good.

1029
01:10:32,494 --> 01:10:34,689
Your Honor, I'm George Gordon.

1030
01:10:34,863 --> 01:10:36,797
I offer this show a 10-week
engagement.

1031
01:10:36,932 --> 01:10:38,991
in my international
follies at $2,500 a week.

1032
01:10:40,369 --> 01:10:42,360
Your Honor, I object.

1033
01:10:42,504 --> 01:10:44,768
This show
is worth $5,000 a week...

1034
01:10:44,907 --> 01:10:47,774
and I refuse to accept
a cent less.

1035
01:10:47,910 --> 01:10:50,378
Attagirl.

1036
01:10:56,952 --> 01:11:00,581
- A marriage license? For you?
- No, for my father and mother.

1037
01:11:00,723 --> 01:11:02,782
Oh, for your fath... Huh?

1038
01:11:06,528 --> 01:11:09,497
Oh, my goodness!
