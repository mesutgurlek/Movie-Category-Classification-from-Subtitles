00:00:05,839 --> 00:00:07,614
What's wrong with this city?

2
00:00:08,141 --> 00:00:10,849
Somewhere there are ashes
and somewhere smoke.

3
00:00:11,611 --> 00:00:13,591
Why doesn't someone say something?

4
00:00:13,847 --> 00:00:16,418
Why do we endure smoke quietly?

5
00:00:16,716 --> 00:00:18,957
Now it's the limit of endurance.

6
00:00:19,219 --> 00:00:22,098
Let's bring this reckless act to an end.

7

Smoking at public places is prohibited.

8
00:00:24,858 --> 00:00:26,963
Violation will lead to penalty.

9

Don't smoke. Or let others smoke.

10
00:00:31,331 --> 00:00:33,277
You will have to pay
a heavy price for smoking.

11
00:00:37,637 --> 00:00:39,116
Who doesn't want to be happy?

12
00:00:41,841 --> 00:00:43,912
But at what price?

13
00:00:44,811 --> 00:00:47,553
You will have to pay
a heavy price for smoking.

14
00:00:49,349 --> 00:00:52,387
Smoking is injurious for you.

15

And for your dear ones

16
00:01:00,727 --> 00:01:02,707

00:12:54,006 --> 00:12:57,044
Sometimes I do yoga...

But this register
has someone else's name.

185
00:13:40,719 --> 00:13:43,962
He was as absorbed in his music...
as I was in him.

186
00:13:45,624 --> 00:13:50,596
I thought we were in love...
he never bothered to correct rne.

187
00:13:51,897 --> 00:13:56,004
But, in truth,
he was the love of my life...

188
00:13:56,101 --> 00:13:58,103
...and I was just his habit.

189
00:13:59,738 --> 00:14:00,842
So, ma: happened?

190
00:14:01,006 --> 00:14:04,249
What could happen?
He found another habit...

191
00:14:04,443 --> 00:14:06,616
Decided that was love.

192
00:14:07,446 --> 00:14:10,359
She was this goddamned
beautiful airhostess...

193

She showed him where
her emergency exits were...

That question makes me feel weak...

198
00:14:34,740 --> 00:14:36,742
So thank God for Dr. Faisal...

00:23:31,777 --> 00:23:33,654
- Open doors and open drawers!

332
00:23:33,712 --> 00:23:34,588
L-li!

333
00:23:34,679 --> 00:23:36,090
Hello!

334
00:23:38,784 --> 00:23:39,694
Here Wm

335
00:23:42,687 --> 00:23:44,223
I was just doing yoga...

336
00:23:45,657 --> 00:23:48,365
If I may say...
your form is remarkable.

337
00:23:51,530 --> 00:23:53,908
Where is
Mademoiselle Skimpy, anyway?

338
00:23:54,699 --> 00:23:56,645
Use was really upset yesterday

339
00:23:57,068 --> 00:23:58,911
Why?! She couldn't
find your ohequebook?!

340
00:23:59,004 --> 00:23:59,812
Hey!

341
00:24:00,071 --> 00:24:01,175
Have some respect!

342
00:24:01,306 --> 00:24:02,649
For your boxers?

343
00:24:04,910 --> 00:24:05,820
What is this?

344
00:24:06,111 --> 00:24:07,920
It's for you!

345
00:24:10,882 --> 00:24:12,987
To hell with Lisa!

346
00:24:13,251 --> 00:24:14,787
'(owe Cute

347
00:24:15,020 --> 00:24:16,499
I came to apologise.

348
00:24:16,655 --> 00:24:17,633
VVith this?

349
00:24:18,123 --> 00:24:19,602
What' you Wm flowers?

350
00:24:19,825 --> 00:24:20,462
Yew

351
00:24:21,426 --> 00:24:22,837
<i>\</i> hate flowers

352
00:24:22,961 --> 00:24:24,372
What did flowers ever do to you?

353
00:24:24,629 --> 00:24:26,631
Flowers are so overrated!

354
00:24:26,998 --> 00:24:29,274
Yeah, they look pretty...
smell nice...

355
00:24:29,468 --> 00:24:30,970
...but colours fade
and scent disappears...

356
00:24:31,036 --> 00:24:35,007
...and what you're left with
is lifeless, wilted and diseased.

357
00:24:36,308 --> 00:24:37,719
Thorns, on the other hand...

358
00:24:38,143 --> 00:24:39,884
They're not so fragile...

359
00:24:40,045 --> 00:24:42,491
Thorns are fearless...

360
00:24:43,949 --> 00:24:45,724
I don't want to be just a flower...

361
00:24:46,051 --> 00:24:47,462
I want to be a thorn.

362
00:24:47,652 --> 00:24:48,790
I want to smack you!

363
00:24:50,755 --> 00:24:53,861
Though she be little,
but she is fierce!

364
00:24:55,126 --> 00:25:00,075
Please sir, share your gruel...

365
00:25:00,432 --> 00:25:01,638
God, take it already...

366
00:25:01,733 --> 00:25:04,009
May a thousand
Gods shine upon you...

367
00:25:05,470 --> 00:25:08,679
You have to admit...
songs of the 80's were amazing...

368
00:25:08,907 --> 00:25:11,285
Cheap, vulgar and extra tacky!

369
00:25:11,510 --> 00:25:13,285
My playlist is 'Cheap Thrills'!

370
00:25:13,445 --> 00:25:15,948
No way... mine is
'Jolly Good Bollywood"!

371
00:25:17,182 --> 00:25:18,889
Most famous song of the 80's?

372
00:25:18,950 --> 00:25:20,657
- Film?
- Himmatwala!

373
00:25:25,190 --> 00:25:26,498
Cheapest song?

374
00:25:26,925 --> 00:25:27,801
Film'?

375
00:25:27,959 --> 00:25:29,597
Maqsad, 1984!

376
00:25:42,574 --> 00:25:44,781
You're not my long
lost brother, are you?

377
00:25:44,976 --> 00:25:46,614
No but maybe the Doctor is!

378
00:25:46,978 --> 00:25:49,219
Hopefully he'll
just be long lost!

379
00:25:49,681 --> 00:25:52,161
So... what are you
doing at 4 PM today?

380
00:25:52,350 --> 00:25:54,956
I'm very busy...
Meetings, appointments...

381
00:25:55,053 --> 00:25:57,090
Shut up! You're free!

382
00:25:57,188 --> 00:25:58,496
Okay x arm

383
00:26:44,269 --> 00:26:46,215
- What's the problem?
- Problem?

384
00:26:46,371 --> 00:26:48,442
I saw you busting
your moves at home...

385
00:26:48,506 --> 00:26:51,612
...what's with the
dainty flailing now?

386
00:26:52,043 --> 00:26:53,283
It's embarrassing.

387
00:26:53,712 --> 00:26:54,850
Embarrassing?

388
00:26:55,547 --> 00:26:58,221
Embarrassment is just a fancy
word for self-importance.

389
00:26:58,350 --> 00:26:59,727
You're nobody here!

390
00:26:59,985 --> 00:27:03,831
So you're not shaming
Daddy Dearest...

391
00:27:03,989 --> 00:27:05,969
Nor are you embarrassing yourself!

392
00:27:06,057 --> 00:27:07,434
Just dance, man!

393
00:27:07,759 --> 00:27:10,433
I can't dance in groups... only sing.

394
00:27:10,729 --> 00:27:14,506
Oh, really?
And that's amazing...

395
00:27:14,733 --> 00:27:17,077
...but this isn't choir
practice - it's a dance class!

396
00:27:18,003 --> 00:27:19,812
It's just not my scene...

397
00:27:19,938 --> 00:27:22,612
Shh! Just dance!

398
00:27:23,041 --> 00:27:25,351
Forget your inner Lois Lane...

399
00:27:25,510 --> 00:27:27,353
...you were born to be Wonder Woman!

400
00:27:27,646 --> 00:27:30,252
In the name of JLo's sex appeal...

401
00:27:30,682 --> 00:27:36,098
...show this cruel world,
you truly are a Baby Doll!

402
00:27:37,255 --> 00:27:38,359
Baby Dow

403
00:27:43,495 --> 00:27:45,270
You're off your rocker...

404
00:27:49,934 --> 00:27:51,208
Get ready

405
00:27:51,870 --> 00:27:53,042
See that gm

406
00:27:53,638 --> 00:27:55,311
Watch that Scene

407
00:27:55,573 --> 00:27:57,450
Digging the Dancing Queen!

408
00:28:37,649 --> 00:28:39,856
Woohoo! That was awesome!

409
00:28:40,351 --> 00:28:42,194
You were right, I feel great!

410
00:28:42,287 --> 00:28:43,459
Told ya!

411
00:28:44,155 --> 00:28:48,262
But if you thought
this was impressive...

412
00:28:48,660 --> 00:28:50,298
...wait 'til you hear me sing...

413
00:28:50,929 --> 00:28:52,374
YOU“ be a fem

414
00:28:52,831 --> 00:28:54,003
God

415
00:28:54,332 --> 00:28:55,310
Sing!

416
00:28:55,767 --> 00:28:57,371
- What?
- Sing!

417
00:28:58,002 --> 00:29:00,380
- What do you mean 'sing'?
- Sing means sing... Sing!

418
00:29:01,072 --> 00:29:02,380
- Here?
- Where else?

419
00:29:02,474 --> 00:29:03,714
On this sidewalk?

420
00:29:03,875 --> 00:29:05,548
Not again!

421
00:29:05,910 --> 00:29:07,082
Why are you getting annoyed?

422
00:29:07,278 --> 00:29:08,780
Because, Celine Dion...

423
00:29:08,880 --> 00:29:14,330
Your self-praise is
driving me up the wall!

424
00:29:15,153 --> 00:29:17,827
You're not taking me seriously...
My voice is a gift from God!

425
00:29:18,056 --> 00:29:19,592
Then sing for Him!

426
00:29:19,824 --> 00:29:20,768
No!

427
00:29:21,459 --> 00:29:23,200
Don't be so attention seeking, man!

428
00:29:23,261 --> 00:29:25,400
What if you fall in love with me?

429
00:29:26,397 --> 00:29:29,674
Well, Mr. Casablanca...

430
00:29:29,934 --> 00:29:32,141
I'll take my chances!

431
00:29:32,904 --> 00:29:33,939
Come on... Sing.

432
00:29:34,539 --> 00:29:35,279
No.

433
00:29:35,473 --> 00:29:36,451
Not singing?

434
00:29:36,908 --> 00:29:38,319
This is your last chance...

435
00:29:39,310 --> 00:29:40,186
Nov

436
00:29:40,278 --> 00:29:42,155
Okay... then get lost!

437
00:30:23,688 --> 00:30:24,689
How was that?

438
00:30:27,158 --> 00:30:28,068
Abhorrent!

439
00:30:28,626 --> 00:30:29,570
Ab-wh at?

440
00:30:29,861 --> 00:30:32,637
That sounded like
an ad for constipation!

441
00:30:32,797 --> 00:30:33,707
Yum

442
00:30:33,932 --> 00:30:36,811
Following a tune isn't singing...

443
00:30:37,168 --> 00:30:40,172
It had no pain... no emotion...

444
00:30:41,506 --> 00:30:43,850
- And you're an expert, so...
- I'm the audience!

445
00:30:44,242 --> 00:30:45,585
There was no feeling.

446
00:30:46,377 --> 00:30:51,451
Because this...
has never been broken.

447
00:30:52,517 --> 00:30:54,554
You'll only really sing
when it does break.

448
00:30:55,253 --> 00:30:57,597
<i>M</i> then' you can do your MBA,
make some money

449
00:30:57,689 --> 00:30:59,032
...and leave music alone.

450
00:30:59,991 --> 00:31:02,437
See you later... Bye!

451
00:31:40,698 --> 00:31:43,144
Charlie Brown...
are you feeling blue?

452
00:31:43,268 --> 00:31:44,474
Hmmm

453
00:31:44,702 --> 00:31:45,840
Hm!

454
00:31:46,404 --> 00:31:48,714
- I knew you'd call to apologise.
- You wish!

455
00:31:48,907 --> 00:31:52,252
No sorry, no mm you

Whatever

457

Listen! I've made another
great plan for a double date!

458
00:31:59,250 --> 00:32:00,661
No, I've had enough!

459
00:32:00,818 --> 00:32:02,126
Just hear me out!

460
00:32:02,353 --> 00:32:05,129
The plan involves not
listening to Lisa's crap...

461
00:32:05,290 --> 00:32:07,099
...and watching you dance!

462
00:32:07,358 --> 00:32:09,702
Because you're my dancing star!

463
00:32:09,861 --> 00:32:10,601
What?

464
00:32:11,029 --> 00:32:12,303
Silent Disco, bro!

Ed Mubarak?

478
00:32:47,899 --> 00:32:50,379
- Today's not Eid...
- Let it go, let it go!

479
00:32:50,635 --> 00:32:54,412
So! If you like the
"vaatavaran" of this place...

480
00:32:56,341 --> 00:32:57,911
Wear your headphones

481
00:32:58,009 --> 00:33:01,252
Switch to a channel you like...
And dance!

482
00:33:01,412 --> 00:33:03,358
And here? an added bonus

What's this?

484
00:33:05,149 --> 00:33:06,924
This is the nectar of love...

485
00:33:07,085 --> 00:33:09,429
Like dreaming while you're awake...

486

You've just disappeared!
Where have you been?

00:33:30,208 --> 00:33:31,881
- In London!
- Shut up!

490
00:33:32,276 --> 00:33:34,722
You broke up with
Ali and forgot us all!

491
00:33:35,380 --> 00:33:37,826
- Are you okay?
- Yeah! Okay, listen...

00:33:52,830 --> 00:33:54,070
Then for sure!

499
00:33:54,799 --> 00:33:56,676
- Okay, tune into 4!
- Okay.

500
00:37:24,408 --> 00:37:28,288
God, I have to pee!

501
00:37:29,013 --> 00:37:29,855
Excuse me (herds a queue

502
00:37:29,947 --> 00:37:31,949
I know, but I really
have to go... Please?

503
00:37:33,084 --> 00:37:34,586
Where'd Lisa disappear?

504
00:37:35,019 --> 00:37:37,625
Screw this, I'm going to the men's.

505
00:37:40,958 --> 00:37:43,131
Excuse me, this is the men's loo.

506
00:37:43,294 --> 00:37:46,275
I know... but sometimes even
I feel like I could be a man...

507
00:37:54,639 --> 00:37:57,643
Doctor... Can you check my pulse?

508
00:38:01,712 --> 00:38:03,089
- Don't cry, don't cry...

509
00:38:03,281 --> 00:38:08,663
My boyfriend's a douchebag, too!
Don't cry!

510
00:38:11,122 --> 00:38:15,161
I'll get us a cab, okay?

511
00:38:22,066 --> 00:38:23,943
Tell him your address!

512
00:38:26,971 --> 00:38:29,008
I don't want to be alone tonight...

513
00:38:30,641 --> 00:38:32,484
Take me with you...

514
00:38:52,096 --> 00:38:54,303

00:39:24,829 --> 00:39:26,069
Nectar of love...

523
00:39:26,397 --> 00:39:27,933
My foot!

524
00:39:29,300 --> 00:39:31,109
Lost my love...

525
00:39:32,436 --> 00:39:33,938
My heart is shattered!

526
00:39:37,074 --> 00:39:43,286
Now little pieces of my heart
are buzzing around me like flies...

527
00:40:01,999 --> 00:40:03,342
Done?

528
00:40:04,869 --> 00:40:08,043
Stop behaving like a spoilt child!

529
00:40:09,106 --> 00:40:10,847
Someone just snatched
your favourite toy!

530

Your heart is just fine!

531

What do you even
know about heartbreak!

532
00:40:15,980 --> 00:40:17,687
Sorry, only you know everything!

533
00:40:17,848 --> 00:40:18,724
Listen!

534
00:40:19,617 --> 00:40:21,790
A thousand people have
their heart broken every day...

And We been down that roam

This is Heartbreak Hotel, my friend...
You have to be qualified!

556

You've driven me mad all night...
Go away!

Curse!

576
00:43:23,133 --> 00:43:24,237
Please don't curse me.

577
00:43:24,768 --> 00:43:26,213
Be gone, evil Wench!

578
00:43:26,570 --> 00:43:29,676
If thee ev'r showeth thy face again,
thee shall be ruin'd!

579
00:43:35,079 --> 00:43:37,059
I'll help her with the bags.

Are you crazy?!

581

Out of here, black-hearted Wench!

582
00:43:42,152 --> 00:43:44,723
I've been dreaming of
talking like that for years!

No, dude... I've got
Bollywood in my blood, too.

629

I want to wear sarees
and run around mountains, too!

630
00:46:40,764 --> 00:46:42,903
The hills are alive...

But you know ma:

632
00:46:45,068 --> 00:46:47,776
I still have one
unrequited Bollywood dream...

633
00:46:47,905 --> 00:46:49,111
Which one?

634
00:46:49,373 --> 00:46:50,681
The airport dream.

635
00:46:52,843 --> 00:46:56,120
The airport dream. For so long
I dreamed that I would be that girl...

636
00:46:56,213 --> 00:46:59,456
...the one the boy chased through
the airport and confessed his love.

637
00:46:59,917 --> 00:47:01,294
Twice I thought he'd come...

638
00:47:01,985 --> 00:47:04,226
Both times I waited for him...

639
00:47:04,855 --> 00:47:06,562
And both times, he didn't come.

640
00:47:06,990 --> 00:47:10,528
Mademoiselle, we are Private Jet
people. We don't have airport dreams.

641

We're young,

Are you serious?

Do you even see what I'm wearing?!

You know, you're useless!

674
00:52:20,437 --> 00:52:23,247
Dude... Bollywood people are nuts!

675
00:52:23,974 --> 00:52:25,885
It's too freaking cold for romance!

676
00:52:26,843 --> 00:52:28,083
Come on m

677
00:52:35,552 --> 00:52:38,692
You should be called Henessy,
not Alizeh.

678
00:52:39,523 --> 00:52:40,866
Cognads not really liquor.

Of course it is! Give it here!

Don't lie... because I've noticed.

00:53:10,954 --> 00:53:11,659
Yeah

685
00:53:12,289 --> 00:53:13,529
I really like you!

00:53:13,657 --> 00:53:15,500
Why? Quick, tell me.

687
00:53:16,626 --> 00:53:18,105
I don't know, man...

688
00:53:19,129 --> 00:53:20,574
The first time we met...

689
00:53:20,664 --> 00:53:22,507
...when we spent the night talking...

690
00:53:22,666 --> 00:53:29,242
I just got the feeling
that you're my friend...

691
00:53:30,140 --> 00:53:32,086
My best friend...

692
00:53:32,943 --> 00:53:34,422
...and always will be.

693
00:53:34,945 --> 00:53:35,946
I don't know...

694
00:53:42,319 --> 00:53:45,232
You know, I wasn't popular in school...

695
00:53:46,656 --> 00:53:49,728
They thought I was a weirdo,
freak, introverted...

696
00:53:50,360 --> 00:53:53,569
And honestly, it made no difference...

697
00:53:54,497 --> 00:53:55,601
You know Wm

698
00:53:57,968 --> 00:54:01,882
Because I knew I was
holding on to my personality...

699
00:54:02,372 --> 00:54:05,216
I was waiting to find that one person...

700
00:54:05,575 --> 00:54:07,555
...who got my weirdness.

701
00:54:16,686 --> 00:54:19,098
So... best friend, huh?

702
00:54:20,657 --> 00:54:23,194
Bestest friend!

703
00:54:27,998 --> 00:54:29,841
And... you're not attracted to me?

704
00:54:32,869 --> 00:54:33,870
No...

705
00:54:41,211 --> 00:54:42,713
What's Wrong?

706
00:54:45,782 --> 00:54:47,523
Ego's a bit bruised...

707
00:54:54,591 --> 00:54:58,562
Are you attracted?

708
00:54:59,696 --> 00:55:00,333
Like...

709
00:55:01,398 --> 00:55:02,240

00:55:03,633 --> 00:55:07,274
Not a bl But yeah <i>\</i> am

711
00:55:15,578 --> 00:55:18,218
Don't feel weird...
I don't love you or anything.

712
00:55:18,715 --> 00:55:20,524
No, no... I know that.

713
00:55:25,055 --> 00:55:28,730
You know,
I'm really happy we're friends...

714
00:55:30,226 --> 00:55:36,438
I feel that sometimes
lust just kills friendship...

715
00:55:37,901 --> 00:55:39,903
Love is passion...

716
00:55:40,737 --> 00:55:43,217
...but friendship is peace.

717
00:55:45,408 --> 00:55:49,754
And I never, ever want
to lose the peace between us.

718
00:55:50,580 --> 00:55:52,753
Girlfriend, boyfriend, husband, wife...

719
00:55:53,216 --> 00:55:56,686
when those relationships die...
the people just leave.

720
00:55:58,888 --> 00:56:04,634
And I never want to leave you, Ayan...

721
00:56:06,996 --> 00:56:08,873
- Never?
- Never

722
00:56:13,870 --> 00:56:15,816
Wow, I feel all mushy...

723
00:56:20,009 --> 00:56:21,044
What do <i>\</i> do?

724

I'm feeling a little mushy, myself...

726
00:56:26,282 --> 00:56:27,659
Give me a hug...

727
00:56:56,079 --> 00:56:57,285
I've decided that...

728
00:56:57,447 --> 00:56:58,425
What?

729
00:56:58,681 --> 00:57:01,719
I've decided we're
staying here another week!

730
00:57:02,218 --> 00:57:06,997
Oh, no... I'm really busy...

734
00:57:14,998 --> 00:57:19,504
Can we get two beers and
something to eat... like peanuts...

735
00:57:19,803 --> 00:57:22,044
Peanuts you know, peanuts?

736
00:57:22,672 --> 00:57:24,845

I'll walk home if I have to,
I just need to go right now!

743
00:59:08,177 --> 00:59:10,020
Where's my stuff?

744
00:59:21,891 --> 00:59:23,893
This room is such a mess...

745
00:59:25,395 --> 00:59:26,874
Ahzeh are you okay?

746
00:59:27,597 --> 00:59:29,235

I don't want to see him.

He was gone.
I erased every trace of him...

Yeah

831
01:04:53,456 --> 01:04:54,992
What does it have to do with me?

832
01:04:55,491 --> 01:04:57,903
Ayan, listen... It's important.

833
01:04:58,494 --> 01:05:02,067
Ali's going on tour for a year...
and he wants me to go with him.

834
01:05:02,698 --> 01:05:04,974
- He wants to marry me and...

- Yes, what else?!

838
01:05:11,807 --> 01:05:15,220
- Mum and Dad have kicked me out...

839
01:05:15,444 --> 01:05:19,586
...they won't come for
the wedding, either...

840
01:05:20,383 --> 01:05:22,659
- Some of Ali's useless cousins
will be at the wedding...

841
01:05:23,519 --> 01:05:26,762
- Will you come from my side...
For me?

842
01:05:29,091 --> 01:05:30,764
I don't have a visa...

843
01:05:31,060 --> 01:05:33,870
- Yo, Mr. Britain!
I'll organize all of that...

844
01:05:34,530 --> 01:05:36,669
- So YOU“ come?

845

What's up?

01:19:31,733 --> 01:19:33,872
Chatter is a fool's pursuit.

932
01:19:34,636 --> 01:19:38,584
Your eyes can't hide
what your words conceal.

933
01:19:43,945 --> 01:19:48,792
Why we your tears?

934
01:19:52,020 --> 01:19:53,727
Don't imprison them...

Well, you were even
talking in your sleep...

01:27:38,820 --> 01:27:40,424
Of course!
You're single...

1000
01:27:41,155 --> 01:27:42,327
Happily divorced...

1001
01:27:42,924 --> 01:27:44,267
and x have no regrets

1002
01:27:44,492 --> 01:27:46,972
raw and x are
very good fnervds

1003
01:27:47,695 --> 01:27:49,971
Every poetess should
marry at least once...

1004
01:27:50,265 --> 01:27:53,576
A happy marriage means
a good life...

1005
01:27:54,335 --> 01:27:57,680
an unhappy one means
good poem

1006
01:27:59,107 --> 01:28:00,552
By the way, I was kidding...

1007
01:28:00,675 --> 01:28:03,622
If you need my poetry...
Go ahead.

1008
01:28:04,512 --> 01:28:05,889
Thanks

1009
01:28:06,414 --> 01:28:08,416
...but what I need is you.

1010
01:28:09,917 --> 01:28:12,090
I don't want to be needed...

1011
01:28:12,820 --> 01:28:14,424
I want to be desired.

1012
01:28:21,129 --> 01:28:23,131
You're relentless...

1013
01:28:23,398 --> 01:28:24,638
Like a walking-talking Ghalib...

1014
01:28:24,732 --> 01:28:26,211
ma: am x supposed m Say'?

1015
01:28:27,535 --> 01:28:29,776
Your silence said
more than enough...

1016
01:28:30,772 --> 01:28:31,773
Don't worry...

1017
01:28:32,440 --> 01:28:34,716
I have no room for
a relationship in my life...

1018
01:28:35,977 --> 01:28:37,285
Not anymore

1019
01:28:39,147 --> 01:28:41,388
There's more than
one kind of relationship...

1020
01:28:42,850 --> 01:28:45,456
...but only if you're up for it.

1021
01:28:48,623 --> 01:28:50,466
What are the rules like?

1022
01:28:50,825 --> 01:28:52,600
Easily broken...

1023
01:28:55,163 --> 01:28:57,234
So you gel my poetry

1024
01:28:57,732 --> 01:28:59,769
The chance to drown your sorrows

1025
01:29:02,003 --> 01:29:03,038
What do x gen

1026
01:29:05,106 --> 01:29:06,744
x thought x was enough

1027
01:32:05,586 --> 01:32:09,295
"I seek the truth that
pierces the darkest night..."

1028
01:32:09,790 --> 01:32:13,897
"I seek the devotion
I surrendered in your stead..."

1029
01:32:14,228 --> 01:32:16,936
<i>'W have</i> known <i>[he wtue
that surrender proffers</i> “

1030
01:32:17,131 --> 01:32:20,305
"But I seek that heaven
for which I have bled."

1031
01:34:27,662 --> 01:34:29,403
Is this supposed to be good?

1032
01:34:29,897 --> 01:34:31,535
I don't get <i>it...</i>

1033
01:34:33,734 --> 01:34:35,611
Didn't you say he was world famous?

1034
01:34:36,370 --> 01:34:37,542
He is...

1035
01:34:38,139 --> 01:34:41,382
People really admire his work...

1036
01:34:42,243 --> 01:34:43,654
And you?

1037
01:34:48,382 --> 01:34:49,622

And leave you alone with him?

1041
01:35:02,430 --> 01:35:03,534
No My

1042

I'm dying to meet your ex-husband.

1043
01:35:10,705 --> 01:35:11,775
HOW COWS'?

1044
01:35:13,107 --> 01:35:14,279

Your Faoebook tells me
too many things have changed...

1047
01:35:25,286 --> 01:35:26,856

Fantastic work, sir!

1051
01:35:33,561 --> 01:35:35,700
Sir? Really... Sir?!

1052
01:35:36,263 --> 01:35:38,869
Are you trying to
make me sound old?

1053
01:35:39,400 --> 01:35:42,244
By the way, he doesn't
call you ma'am does he?

1054
01:35:42,403 --> 01:35:44,110
- You think?!
- I don't know!

1055
01:35:46,440 --> 01:35:49,978
So you're the one...
who's keeping her up at night...

1056
01:35:50,144 --> 01:35:52,556
Why waste time on sleep?

1057
01:35:53,147 --> 01:35:55,957
Sleep is critical...

1058
01:35:56,817 --> 01:35:58,888
<i>for he!' [0 dream</i> about <i>me?</i>

1059
01:35:59,220 --> 01:36:00,494
Oh, now I definitely
won't let her sleep.

1060
01:36:00,588 --> 01:36:02,158
I can't see this...

1061
01:36:02,923 --> 01:36:04,561
Change of topic!

1062
01:36:06,327 --> 01:36:10,002
Besides, you've fulfilled
your dreams...

1063
01:36:10,197 --> 01:36:12,871
Your new work is very interesting.

1064
01:36:12,933 --> 01:36:14,674
Actually, fantastic!

1065
01:36:15,903 --> 01:36:20,511
Without a lover in his arms,
what else is a man to do...

1066
01:36:21,342 --> 01:36:25,449
- Do you guys rehearse these lines?
- No, totally natural!

1067
01:36:25,613 --> 01:36:26,887
Ah, natural...

1068
01:36:29,583 --> 01:36:33,588
People often shroud
their fear with words...

1069
01:36:34,522 --> 01:36:37,230
Our relationship
may have changed...

1070
01:36:38,425 --> 01:36:39,927
...but the fear remains.

1071
01:36:40,861 --> 01:36:42,067
Why mu <i>n</i> change

<i>w</i> x may ask?

1073
01:36:43,731 --> 01:36:46,610
Maybe you should
be asking the person...

1074
01:36:46,901 --> 01:36:48,972
...whose nights are now yours...

1075
01:36:51,138 --> 01:36:53,118
People often falter...

1076
01:36:53,941 --> 01:36:55,716
...on the slippery slopes
of relationships...

1077
01:36:56,377 --> 01:36:57,549
Yeah

1078
01:37:00,014 --> 01:37:02,255
You could have shown
me a better way...

1079
01:37:03,083 --> 01:37:06,189
Let the one who is lost,
find his own way...

1080
01:37:12,459 --> 01:37:14,234
x hate you

1081
01:37:14,295 --> 01:37:16,901
A We no, a bl

1082
01:37:17,631 --> 01:37:19,872
Such hatred... so soon?
Give me a chance...

1083
01:37:19,934 --> 01:37:23,438
Hating you is
completely justified...

1084
01:37:23,771 --> 01:37:26,752
Because I still love Saba...

1085
01:37:29,176 --> 01:37:31,452
I gave your love a chance...

1086
01:37:31,812 --> 01:37:34,918
It's time for you to
give my friendship a chance.

1087
01:37:36,317 --> 01:37:37,625
Isn't that hard'?

1088
01:37:37,952 --> 01:37:38,953
- What?

1089
01:37:39,453 --> 01:37:43,196
To love someone...
who doesn't love you in return?

1090
01:37:47,962 --> 01:37:51,466
It's the most beautiful
feeling in the world...

1091
01:37:53,968 --> 01:37:56,881
- Doesn't it make you feel weak?
- Not at all.

1092
01:37:57,972 --> 01:38:01,215
There's nothing like
the power of unrequited love...

1093
01:38:01,842 --> 01:38:05,187
Unlike other bonds,
it isn't shared...

1094
01:38:05,679 --> 01:38:08,319
It's mine...
and mine alone.

1095
01:38:11,652 --> 01:38:16,863
For a love like this,
I don't need Saba to love her...

1096
01:38:18,225 --> 01:38:20,432
There's no better love than that...

1097
01:38:23,497 --> 01:38:26,239
"if you gamble in
the name of love..."

1098
01:38:26,934 --> 01:38:29,744
"Stake what you like...
what's to fear?"

1099
01:38:30,404 --> 01:38:32,782
"How wonderful if you win..."

1100
01:38:33,207 --> 01:38:37,883
"Even if you lose...
all is not lost."

1101
01:39:22,022 --> 01:39:23,524
Don't hang up!

I've been trying to call you forever!

1108
01:39:59,793 --> 01:40:01,272
- You blocked my number!

1109
01:40:01,328 --> 01:40:02,534
What did you think I'd do?

1110
01:40:02,696 --> 01:40:03,902
Walk you down the aisle?

1111

Congratulations!

01:42:59,606 --> 01:43:01,745
'...but leave that DJ Ali behind.'

1161
01:43:01,875 --> 01:43:04,617
'He has a concert,
anyway... I'll be there!'

1162
01:43:12,586 --> 01:43:14,031
"Hi!
"Hi!

1163
01:43:22,429 --> 01:43:25,273
You're dying to wait
by the window...

1164
01:43:25,933 --> 01:43:28,743
Check if she called...
Walk around restlessly...

1165
01:43:29,069 --> 01:43:31,777
You're not fooling
anyone with this pose...

1166
01:43:31,972 --> 01:43:34,145
What? Me? Why?
I'm totally chill...

1167
01:43:34,241 --> 01:43:35,481
I'm cool!

1168
01:43:36,443 --> 01:43:38,252
Someone's at the door...

1169
01:43:39,413 --> 01:43:41,051
Go She? here

1170
01:43:47,221 --> 01:43:48,291
I-li!

1171
01:43:48,455 --> 01:43:49,433
<i>Nam</i>

1172
01:43:49,556 --> 01:43:51,229
Hi... Cold outside?

1173
01:43:52,326 --> 01:43:53,566
What are you doing?

1174
01:43:53,860 --> 01:43:55,999
Didn't bring any wine?
Flowers? Thorns? Nothing?

1175
01:43:56,063 --> 01:43:56,973
Should I have?

1176
01:43:57,064 --> 01:43:58,134
Saba

1177
01:43:58,665 --> 01:43:59,439
AhZeh

1178
01:44:01,068 --> 01:44:02,240
Welcome home...

1179
01:44:02,402 --> 01:44:04,040
- So Alizeh...
- So nice to meet you...

1180
01:44:04,104 --> 01:44:06,744
Heard so much about you...
All good things, I hope!

1181
01:44:08,342 --> 01:44:09,377
What 7

1182
01:44:09,443 --> 01:44:13,118
No... just... trying to
ease the tension!

1183
01:44:13,380 --> 01:44:14,688
Get a hold on yourself...

1184
01:44:14,748 --> 01:44:17,558
The 'tension' will disappear?
Come...

1185
01:44:17,751 --> 01:44:20,391
- You know how girls can be!
- Sexist remark...

1186
01:44:20,520 --> 01:44:22,864
- Not appreciated!
- Not at all!

1187
01:44:22,990 --> 01:44:26,233
Give our intelligence its due!

1188
01:44:28,895 --> 01:44:29,805
Wine?

1189
01:44:29,896 --> 01:44:31,204
Maybe later...

1190
01:44:31,265 --> 01:44:32,369
Ah, okay

1191
01:44:32,432 --> 01:44:33,604
But, Saba

1192
01:44:33,700 --> 01:44:37,614
Beauty like yours often
overshadows intelligence...

1193
01:44:37,904 --> 01:44:40,885
Ask those of us who
live off our personality...

1194
01:44:40,974 --> 01:44:42,954
Beauty fades, Alizeh...

1195
01:44:43,143 --> 01:44:45,783
But Death, himself,
can't kill personality...

1196
01:44:46,079 --> 01:44:49,652
Wow... So the poetry
really was yours!

1197
01:44:49,916 --> 01:44:54,092
I thought Ayan was just
copying it off the internet!

1198
01:44:55,489 --> 01:44:57,435
If it weren't for poetry...

1199
01:44:57,758 --> 01:45:00,204
...I'd have died a thousand
living deaths already...

1200
01:45:02,095 --> 01:45:03,096
Cheese?

1201
01:45:06,733 --> 01:45:10,875
Will I sound phony
if I praise you some more?

1202
01:45:11,371 --> 01:45:13,510
Not at all...
Please go ahead...

1203
01:45:13,573 --> 01:45:14,881
No judgments!

1204
01:45:15,409 --> 01:45:17,013
Pictures do you no justice...

1205
01:45:17,077 --> 01:45:19,284
You're even more
beautiful in person.

1206
01:45:21,481 --> 01:45:25,019
Oh, so those pictures
were to show you...

1207
01:45:26,053 --> 01:45:28,090
To make her jealous...

1208
01:45:28,555 --> 01:45:30,535
...but why waste
envy on the resentful?

1209
01:45:31,058 --> 01:45:31,934
Wow, Ayan

1210
01:45:32,025 --> 01:45:33,868
Saba, looks like you've
had an influence...

1211
01:45:34,127 --> 01:45:35,037
A We DH of M

1212
01:45:35,095 --> 01:45:36,267
A little to go...

1213
01:45:40,434 --> 01:45:41,913
Well, it's not envy...

1214
01:45:42,135 --> 01:45:44,615
But you can't sing
to a mute person...

1215
01:45:44,705 --> 01:45:46,480
...and expect them
not to feel inferior!

1216
01:45:48,542 --> 01:45:52,820
Speaking of singing...
This is my favourite song...

1217
01:45:53,046 --> 01:45:56,892
"O lover, don't ask me
to love like I did before..."

1218
01:45:57,551 --> 01:45:59,724
"O lover, don't ask me..."

1219
01:46:00,053 --> 01:46:01,589
To love like I did before.

1220
01:46:11,998 --> 01:46:12,703
Dinner?

1221
01:46:13,367 --> 01:46:14,038
Bream

1222
01:46:20,407 --> 01:46:21,750
Why didn't you bring Ali?

1223
01:46:22,876 --> 01:46:24,913
He had a concert 50

1224
01:46:25,312 --> 01:46:27,223
DJ Ali's super busy, you see...

1225
01:46:28,882 --> 01:46:32,022
Why do you keep calling him that?
Like it's an insult...

1226
01:46:32,152 --> 01:46:33,426
Not at all!

1227
01:46:33,854 --> 01:46:37,768
Who doesn't dream of making
people dance orl their fingertips?

1228
01:46:39,960 --> 01:46:42,065
Alizeh, may I ask
you something personal?

1229
01:46:42,129 --> 01:46:43,904
If you don't mind...

1230
01:46:44,197 --> 01:46:45,574
Sure

1231
01:46:47,067 --> 01:46:50,879
How did you not fall in love
with someone so charming?

1232
01:46:57,110 --> 01:46:58,817
Charming for you, maybe...

1233
01:46:59,045 --> 01:47:01,423
He was a mg baby
when x met mm

1234
01:47:02,082 --> 01:47:06,258
He cried orl the streets,
cried in my arms...

1235
01:47:06,353 --> 01:47:07,696
Really?!

1236
01:47:08,255 --> 01:47:11,930
Ayan... Is this a compliment
or a slight?

1237
01:47:12,225 --> 01:47:14,205
You've never cried in my arms...

1238
01:47:15,295 --> 01:47:17,673
How could I cry in your arms...

1239
01:47:19,065 --> 01:47:21,545
...when I'm so distracted by
my other feelings...

1240
01:48:05,345 --> 01:48:07,325
You got lucky, Ayan!

1241
01:48:08,081 --> 01:48:10,425
Saba's wonderful.

1242
01:48:18,024 --> 01:48:19,002
Anyway

1243
01:48:19,726 --> 01:48:21,330
- Thank you for dinner.
- Go to hell!

1244
01:48:21,995 --> 01:48:23,906
'Thank you for dinner'?!

1245
01:48:26,600 --> 01:48:27,704
You're soulless!

1246
01:48:28,235 --> 01:48:30,044
Don't you have any feelings?!

1247
01:48:30,670 --> 01:48:32,741
Not jealousy, not guilt...

1248
01:48:33,039 --> 01:48:36,145
- Nothing?!
- I feel everything, Ayan!

1249
01:48:36,910 --> 01:48:38,719
But you'd never
understand if I told you...

1250
01:48:38,778 --> 01:48:40,280
You'd just misconstrue it all!

1251
01:48:41,781 --> 01:48:43,351
You're a goddamn child!

1252
01:48:43,583 --> 01:48:45,085
You've got everything!

1253
01:48:45,552 --> 01:48:47,964
Goals, passion,
a relationship...

1254
01:48:48,088 --> 01:48:49,226
Why are you still so stubborn?!

1255
01:48:49,322 --> 01:48:50,232
Because <i>\</i> arm

1256
01:48:50,524 --> 01:48:52,367
I'm stubborn
because it's my heart!

1257
01:48:52,726 --> 01:48:55,206
What are you going
to do about it?!

1258
01:49:02,469 --> 01:49:04,244
Why can': you we me?

1259
01:49:07,641 --> 01:49:10,781
I do love you, Ayan...

1260
01:49:13,280 --> 01:49:16,022
Just not the Way
you Wm me m

1261
01:49:17,584 --> 01:49:18,824
Why?

1262
01:49:20,186 --> 01:49:23,030
I can't... Please...

1263
01:49:33,333 --> 01:49:35,904
- I don't want to be selfish, Ayan-
- Get lost.

1264
01:50:17,877 --> 01:50:18,947
N: over, Ayan

1265
01:50:21,581 --> 01:50:22,787
It's over.

1266
01:50:37,597 --> 01:50:39,008
Wed

1267
01:50:42,068 --> 01:50:43,411
Fm m you

1268
01:50:46,806 --> 01:50:48,251
...then to myself.

1269
01:50:51,645 --> 01:50:54,751
I lied that I don't
have place for love...

1270
01:51:02,889 --> 01:51:06,564
I'm falling in love
with you, Ayan...

1271
01:51:09,529 --> 01:51:13,875
And today, I finally understood
that you can never love me...

1272
01:51:14,534 --> 01:51:16,639
...the way you love Alizeh...

1273
01:51:19,539 --> 01:51:21,041
And SUN

1274
01:51:22,976 --> 01:51:24,546
I love you...

1275
01:51:30,950 --> 01:51:32,122
What do <i>\</i> do?

1276
01:51:32,952 --> 01:51:35,660
Saba, you've always known...

1277
01:51:36,623 --> 01:51:40,332
I can't do this, Ayan...

1278
01:51:42,962 --> 01:51:46,102
I've been down this road...

1279
01:51:47,667 --> 01:51:49,237
It's broken me once before...

1280
01:51:51,337 --> 01:51:52,338
Saba

1281
01:51:53,973 --> 01:51:57,853
Please don't try to
change my mind...

1282
01:52:00,080 --> 01:52:02,060
<i>V you try</i>

1283
01:52:04,451 --> 01:52:06,124
I'll give in...

If I give in...

1285
01:52:13,460 --> 01:52:14,871
I'll fall apart again...

1286
01:52:19,232 --> 01:52:22,213
We can't choose who
to fall in love with...

1287
01:52:25,205 --> 01:52:30,086
But We can choose
when m <i>mm</i> away

1288
01:52:32,078 --> 01:52:33,751
Go, Ayan

1289

Go...

1290
01:53:58,097 --> 01:53:59,440
Let me go...

Please... let rne go...

I can't go on like this...

So x have m go' okay?

Okay?!

I have to go...

1297
01:54:30,096 --> 01:54:32,042
If I can't do it...

1298
01:54:32,098 --> 01:54:34,135
then you have to be
the stronger one

1299
01:54:35,101 --> 01:54:36,205
Okay?

1300
01:54:37,604 --> 01:54:40,881
» Okay?

Good Job on the mm

Looks like you're doing well...

1309
02:01:08,027 --> 02:01:11,065
Well, I couldn't be
Mohammad Rafi...

1310
02:01:11,364 --> 02:01:13,708
...but I've found some
love on the internet...

<i>Great</i>

<i>Sorry</i>

I'm finding this
formality really funny...

1315
02:01:28,948 --> 02:01:32,122
The truth is that I'd been
hoping to run into you...

1316
02:01:32,385 --> 02:01:33,955
So I could beat you up...

1317
02:01:35,721 --> 02:01:38,964
You have no idea how much
I wanted to beat you up, DJ Ali!

1318
02:01:40,860 --> 02:01:41,770
Nice...

1319
02:01:42,395 --> 02:01:43,806
Why'd you feel that way?

02:01:48,000 --> 02:01:51,174
Your love was so strong that
mine couldn't live up to it.

1322
02:01:51,971 --> 02:01:53,780
What else have
I ever done...

1323
02:01:54,006 --> 02:01:56,452
Sang some songs...
and fell in love.

'(owe fortunate

1325
02:02:00,079 --> 02:02:03,390
Not everyone can love
so faithfully...

1326
02:02:06,485 --> 02:02:07,759
How's Alizeh doing?

1327
02:02:14,760 --> 02:02:16,239
You're serious?
You don't know?

1328
02:02:16,729 --> 02:02:18,231
I don't know... what?

1329
02:02:21,367 --> 02:02:22,778
Congratulations, man...

1330
02:02:23,002 --> 02:02:24,310
She left me.

1331
02:02:32,812 --> 02:02:35,292
Maybe I couldn't love
her the way she wanted me to...

1332
02:02:36,382 --> 02:02:37,986
I haven't seen her in two years...

1333
02:02:39,018 --> 02:02:41,328
Even her parents
haven't heard from her.

1334
02:02:41,654 --> 02:02:45,966
Last I heard, she was in London,
but I don't have the details...

1335
02:02:47,259 --> 02:02:48,932
Why didn't she call you?

1336
02:03:06,679 --> 02:03:09,387
Everyone knows love is crooked...

1337
02:03:09,949 --> 02:03:12,395
But to find peace
in that crooked love...

1338
02:03:12,551 --> 02:03:14,258
...is a gift only few have.

1339
02:03:15,020 --> 02:03:15,896
- This?!'

1340
02:03:16,255 --> 02:03:18,064
'This is my happy place!'

1341

'I come here when the
world gets too much...'

1344
02:03:30,069 --> 02:03:31,377
Crooked love.

1345
02:03:31,570 --> 02:03:34,642
'When I want to spend
time with myself...'

1346

'Because this is the only
place on earth that knows...'

You think it'll make a
difference if you disappear?!

I've been lying here for
2 days like a homeless man...

1360
02:05:52,044 --> 02:05:53,717
I'm frozen through!

This is the cone and
this is the ice cream!

Haven't eaten, haven't slept...
Not used the loo for any business!

What if you'd showed up?!

- Where the hell were you?!
- Slap you!

At least give me a hug!

1371
02:06:46,532 --> 02:06:48,068
Dying means what?

1372
02:06:48,701 --> 02:06:50,374
What do you mean dying?!

1373
02:07:01,480 --> 02:07:03,289
Love is like cancer.

1374
02:07:04,450 --> 02:07:06,327
Comes without warning...

1375
02:07:06,785 --> 02:07:08,787
...and destroys you in its wake.

1376
02:07:10,923 --> 02:07:13,233
This can't be happening, Alizeh...

1377
02:07:16,228 --> 02:07:19,573
Well. .. It's happened.

1378
02:07:25,304 --> 02:07:28,308
I thought I was so cool...

1379
02:07:30,009 --> 02:07:32,819
Love turned me
into such a loser.

1380
02:07:36,482 --> 02:07:39,156
Ali was making me act insane...

1381
02:07:39,551 --> 02:07:42,532
From checking his phone,
to following him around...

1382
02:07:43,856 --> 02:07:47,668
- I'd stopped being his wife
to act like a parole officer.

1383
02:07:49,528 --> 02:07:51,906
I can't even really complain...

1384
02:07:55,034 --> 02:07:57,708
I was even willing
to overlook the cheating...

1385
02:07:59,705 --> 02:08:01,150
Thankfully...

1386
02:08:01,974 --> 02:08:05,148
I finally gathered the
last shreds of my dignity...

1387
02:08:07,613 --> 02:08:08,887
Wand left him.

1388
02:08:09,748 --> 02:08:13,059
- I decided that my husband does
not control my self-worth.

1389
02:08:13,318 --> 02:08:19,234
All that anger, hatred,
balled up in my throat...

1390
02:08:21,527 --> 02:08:24,303
I dismissed it as an
effect of the circumstance...

1391
02:08:25,564 --> 02:08:27,737
The doctors called it cancer.

1392
02:08:27,933 --> 02:08:30,072
- Straight to 4th stage!

1393
02:08:31,070 --> 02:08:36,884
I never even scored
that high in school, man!

1394
02:08:38,811 --> 02:08:40,882
But look at you!

1395
02:08:41,346 --> 02:08:45,590
You've gone from just
Ayan Sanger to Mr. Ayan Singer!

1396
02:08:48,887 --> 02:08:53,165
If you even think of dying...
I'll kill you.

1397
02:08:55,427 --> 02:08:59,102
Now that you're here...
I don't ever want to die.

So low-key?

Alizeh, I just donated my hair...
And you're giving me an lrfan Khan stare?

1411

A little over-the-top won't hurt!

Ayan, have you gone nuts?

1413
02:10:53,345 --> 02:10:55,052
Take a look at yourself!

We'll have to call security!

I have no real religion...

1480
02:19:13,912 --> 02:19:15,550
Gel out of here

1481
02:19:16,247 --> 02:19:17,521
Go.

1482
02:19:17,682 --> 02:19:20,925
I can't explain this to you anymore...

1483
02:19:21,019 --> 02:19:24,432
If you can't understand, just leave...

1484
02:19:24,656 --> 02:19:27,899
Take your stuff and get out!

1485
02:19:29,561 --> 02:19:30,631
Get out!

1486
02:19:30,762 --> 02:19:32,435
Get out, Ayan!

1487
02:19:39,604 --> 02:19:40,708
AhZeh

1488
02:19:42,707 --> 02:19:44,118
<i>Ahleh, I'm sorry</i>

1489
02:19:55,387 --> 02:19:58,266
It's a strange story...
of Love and Friendship.

1490
02:19:58,757 --> 02:20:01,465
Love, the hero...
and Friendship, the heroine.

1491
02:20:01,926 --> 02:20:04,998
The awful thing is that
Love never understood Friendship.

1492
02:20:05,230 --> 02:20:09,576
'I do love you, Ayan...
Just not the way you want me to.'

1493
02:20:09,868 --> 02:20:11,677
- 'Love is passion...'

1494
02:20:12,504 --> 02:20:15,610
- '...but friendship is peace.'

1495
02:20:18,576 --> 02:20:23,150
One night, tired and weary,
Love threw a tantrum...

1496
02:20:23,982 --> 02:20:25,518
Like a spoilt child... Stupid!

1497
02:20:25,917 --> 02:20:27,760
And what did Friendship do?

1498
02:20:29,754 --> 02:20:30,698
AhZeh

1499
02:20:31,089 --> 02:20:34,161
Friendship threw a tantrum, too,
and left in a huff.

1500
02:20:37,796 --> 02:20:39,935
And where else do heroines go?

1501
02:20:40,732 --> 02:20:41,642
The airport.

1502
02:20:42,133 --> 02:20:44,977
- 'Ayah... I'm going back home...'

1503
02:20:45,270 --> 02:20:47,341
And Love freaked out

1504
02:20:47,505 --> 02:20:51,146
- 'I hope one clay you'll
understand my love...'

1505
02:20:51,443 --> 02:20:55,152
When Love realised that Friendship
is leaving him forever... He ran.

1506
02:20:55,513 --> 02:20:58,323
And how he ram

1507
02:21:03,288 --> 02:21:04,164
H'! tam

1508
02:21:04,389 --> 02:21:05,459
Heathrow Airport!

1509
02:21:08,460 --> 02:21:09,564
H'! trans

1510
02:21:13,765 --> 02:21:15,244
He ram

1511
02:21:17,936 --> 02:21:19,882
He didn't stop to breathe...

1512
02:21:21,172 --> 02:21:24,881
Because Love knew...
Friendship was about to breathe her last...

1513
02:21:25,877 --> 02:21:29,154
And he wanted to be with
her 'til her last moments.

1514
02:21:29,948 --> 02:21:31,291
That was Love's right.

1515
02:21:42,460 --> 02:21:44,804
I need to get to BA 109!

1516
02:21:46,531 --> 02:21:48,841
I'm sorry, the gate closed
2O minutes ago!

1517
02:21:48,933 --> 02:21:50,378
Has the flight taken off'?

1518
02:21:50,568 --> 02:21:51,911

I'm acting, I'm not really dying...

1530

Don't react... We'll get caught.

1531
02:23:59,263 --> 02:24:02,142
How else do you runaway
from a runway?

1532

Cancers got m have some perks

1533
02:24:11,609 --> 02:24:14,112
You came to the airport, Ayan...

1534
02:24:15,546 --> 02:24:18,220
You fulfilled my dream!

1535
02:24:19,951 --> 02:24:22,659
Alizeh, I'm sorry for last night...

1536
02:24:24,956 --> 02:24:29,098
Friendship doesn't know
sorry/'s and thank you's...

1537
02:24:33,398 --> 02:24:37,471
I swear I'll never trouble
you about this again...

1538
02:24:38,603 --> 02:24:40,344
Because, Ayan

1539
02:24:41,172 --> 02:24:44,984
It's a lot like love!

1540
02:24:47,845 --> 02:24:49,688
I friend you.

1541
02:24:50,014 --> 02:24:52,585
I friend you, too.

1542
02:24:53,451 --> 02:24:55,021
I friend you for life...

I friend you, too,
for whatever life is left.

1544
02:25:09,067 --> 02:25:11,479
Come, now, sing something...

Anything you like... I'm sick!

Hey... can I sing something?

Done
