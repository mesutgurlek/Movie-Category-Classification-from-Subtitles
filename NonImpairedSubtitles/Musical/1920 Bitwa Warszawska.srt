1
00:00:51,840 --> 00:00:56,840
World War One...

2
00:00:57,320 --> 00:01:00,019
brought defeat to the three powers...

3
00:01:00,119 --> 00:01:04,964
that had occupied
the partitioned Poland for 123 years.

4
00:01:05,239 --> 00:01:08,280
Germany and Austria lost the war.

5
00:01:11,120 --> 00:01:14,880
The Bolshevik Revolution plunged Russia...

6
00:01:15,079 --> 00:01:17,374
into a bloody civil war.

7
00:01:18,319 --> 00:01:21,280
In November 1918,

8
00:01:21,480 --> 00:01:23,900
after over a century of bondage

9
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:27,080
Poland regained her independence.

10
00:01:46,239 --> 00:01:48,239
Encode.

11
00:01:49,439 --> 00:01:51,600
'Moscow. The Kremlin.'.

12
00:01:53,359 --> 00:01:56,280
To the attention of Comrade Lenin.

13
00:02:00,480 --> 00:02:02,680
At this moment,

14
00:02:03,640 --> 00:02:07,210
when the majority of the white generals...

15
00:02:08,439 --> 00:02:10,640
have been defeated,

16
00:02:11,759 --> 00:02:14,480
the invincible Red Army...

17
00:02:16,400 --> 00:02:19,120
should come to assist...

18
00:02:21,280 --> 00:02:23,660
the Polish proletariat...

19
00:02:25,520 --> 00:02:28,240
in its struggle to abolish...

20
00:02:28,400 --> 00:02:31,600
'the bourgeois government.'.

21
00:02:32,319 --> 00:02:35,099
THE KREMLIN, MOSCOW
'From the Polish Soviet Republic'

22
00:02:35,199 --> 00:02:37,720
to the worldwide revolution.

23
00:02:37,919 --> 00:02:40,760
Signed: Leon Trotsky,

24
00:02:40,960 --> 00:02:44,300
'People's Commissar
for Military and Naval Affairs.'

25
00:02:44,400 --> 00:02:48,099
I trust the Politburo
will support this decision?

26
00:02:48,199 --> 00:02:50,520
Poland is a barrier...

27
00:02:51,120 --> 00:02:55,900
that separates the Russian revolution
from the European revolution.

28
00:02:56,000 --> 00:02:58,880
It must be eliminated.

29
00:02:59,479 --> 00:03:02,964
Thank you, comrade Stalin.
Who's in favor?

30
00:03:08,560 --> 00:03:12,440
So, comrades...
first we take Poland,

31
00:03:13,280 --> 00:03:15,059
then Germany,

32
00:03:15,159 --> 00:03:17,480
Italy, England...

33
00:03:18,159 --> 00:03:20,199
and the entire world.

34
00:03:22,560 --> 00:03:26,520
1920: BATTLE OF WARSAW

35
00:04:41,639 --> 00:04:45,500
I know this scent so well
t read your little card

36
00:04:45,600 --> 00:04:49,085
I'm tired of your gifts of gems and gold.

37
00:04:49,519 --> 00:04:53,320
'Cause now I have a whim to travel very far.

38
00:04:53,560 --> 00:04:57,130
Why don't we just escape out of this cold.

39
00:05:06,959 --> 00:05:12,314
To be there, with you, my sweetie,
to be there, in our Tahiti...

40
00:05:18,920 --> 00:05:23,280
WARSAW A special manifesto
to the Polish nation.

41
00:05:23,480 --> 00:05:25,260
Hear ye, hear ye.

42
00:05:25,360 --> 00:05:27,360
Fellow citizens.

43
00:05:27,639 --> 00:05:31,160
We've regained our political autonomy,

44
00:05:31,360 --> 00:05:33,979
but our poetry is shitting on itself.

45
00:05:34,079 --> 00:05:37,900
It is high time we created
new canons of national art.

46
00:05:38,000 --> 00:05:40,920
Down with the bourgeois Dadaism.

47
00:05:41,120 --> 00:05:42,859
Down with it.

48
00:05:42,959 --> 00:05:44,959
Down with it.

49
00:06:09,199 --> 00:06:13,560
Down with the Cubism, Primitivism
and Expressionism.

50
00:06:13,759 --> 00:06:15,260
Down with it.

51
00:06:15,360 --> 00:06:19,720
Our new art shall draw
on the proletarian Onanism.

52
00:06:21,560 --> 00:06:24,620
Wankers of the world, unite.
Gentlemen...

53
00:06:24,720 --> 00:06:27,695
I opt for a more patriotic content.

54
00:06:27,959 --> 00:06:30,700
They'll accuse us of Bolshevik agitation.

55
00:06:30,800 --> 00:06:34,419
The Major is right.
Some patriotic spirit, gentlemen.

56
00:06:34,519 --> 00:06:39,789
Every girl is proud and merry
when a patriot plucks her cherry.

57
00:06:43,319 --> 00:06:48,760
No one will be as dear to me as you.

58
00:06:48,959 --> 00:06:51,960
Only you.
Excuse me... sorry...

59
00:06:52,480 --> 00:06:57,400
No one's kisses will be so sweet as yours...

60
00:06:57,680 --> 00:06:59,680
none but yours.

61
00:07:01,240 --> 00:07:04,520
Your heart is so kind and sweet

62
00:07:05,399 --> 00:07:08,760
I can calm and comfort mine.

63
00:07:09,560 --> 00:07:12,920
When I'm down and cry or weep...

64
00:07:13,240 --> 00:07:15,800
and pine.

65
00:07:18,240 --> 00:07:23,640
No one else can love me so much as you.

66
00:07:24,399 --> 00:07:26,440
Only you.

67
00:07:27,079 --> 00:07:32,120
Who can understand me so well as you.

68
00:07:32,920 --> 00:07:35,000
Only you.

69
00:07:36,240 --> 00:07:39,520
Other's words and sweet caresses...

70
00:07:40,639 --> 00:07:43,529
always will be cold and dull...

71
00:07:45,120 --> 00:07:50,240
for my love is once and for all for you.

72
00:07:50,920 --> 00:07:52,920
Only you.

73
00:07:56,680 --> 00:07:58,680
Bravo.

74
00:08:02,439 --> 00:08:04,439
You're late again.

75
00:08:07,279 --> 00:08:09,659
We're being mobilized and...

76
00:08:09,800 --> 00:08:11,500
Oh Christ.

77
00:08:11,600 --> 00:08:16,700
A stint at the front will cure him
of that futurist nonsense.

78
00:08:16,920 --> 00:08:21,085
Oh, no, no. Nonsense
is my specialty. Right, dear?

79
00:08:28,639 --> 00:08:30,639
Relax.

80
00:08:58,399 --> 00:09:00,399
I love you.

81
00:09:00,679 --> 00:09:01,980
What?

82
00:09:02,080 --> 00:09:04,080
I love you.

83
00:09:04,840 --> 00:09:05,980
A lot?

84
00:09:06,080 --> 00:09:07,459
A lot.

85
00:09:07,559 --> 00:09:11,299
How much is a lot?
A lot is a lot is a lot.

86
00:09:14,200 --> 00:09:16,200
Marry me.

87
00:09:18,919 --> 00:09:20,919
Marry me.

88
00:09:21,879 --> 00:09:23,879
Do it.

89
00:09:26,799 --> 00:09:28,960
Today. Now. This instant.

90
00:09:29,720 --> 00:09:31,720
You madman.

91
00:09:44,360 --> 00:09:46,440
Don't get up, gentlemen.

92
00:09:47,039 --> 00:09:48,340
So...

93
00:09:48,440 --> 00:09:50,380
Here you are.
Thank you.

94
00:09:50,480 --> 00:09:52,480
Ten of clubs.

95
00:09:57,080 --> 00:09:59,080
Ace of hearts.

96
00:10:02,080 --> 00:10:05,419
How do they do that, Ola?
They count the cards.

97
00:10:05,519 --> 00:10:08,834
Make use of your talent in Monte Carlo.

98
00:10:09,000 --> 00:10:12,145
I'm on the black list there.
Me too.

99
00:10:16,159 --> 00:10:18,320
Ignacy, is that you?

100
00:10:18,639 --> 00:10:22,634
Oh... God bless you.
With Father Ignacy, please.

101
00:10:23,480 --> 00:10:26,600
Asleep? At this hour?
So wake him up.

102
00:10:27,279 --> 00:10:29,380
I'm calling from the Curia.

103
00:10:29,480 --> 00:10:34,920
Yes, the bishop's one, who else's?
Get him for me, on the double.

104
00:10:36,440 --> 00:10:38,650
Gentlemen, I am impressed.

105
00:10:41,399 --> 00:10:44,299
Captain Kostrzewa.
Will you permit me...

106
00:10:44,399 --> 00:10:46,779
to ask the lady to dance?

107
00:10:46,840 --> 00:10:48,659
I'd be immensely honored.

108
00:10:48,759 --> 00:10:51,360
You are absolutely ravishing.

109
00:10:51,639 --> 00:10:54,280
The lady only dances on stage.

110
00:10:55,559 --> 00:10:58,619
And that?
That was someone special.

111
00:10:59,919 --> 00:11:02,080
What are you suggesting?

112
00:11:03,320 --> 00:11:05,480
Enough, pops.
Excuse me?

113
00:11:05,679 --> 00:11:07,679
You're dismissed.

114
00:11:12,080 --> 00:11:14,840
I demand satisfaction.

115
00:11:15,480 --> 00:11:16,980
What are you doing?

116
00:11:17,080 --> 00:11:18,860
Major...

117
00:11:18,960 --> 00:11:22,779
the uniform of a Polish officer
has been stained.

118
00:11:22,879 --> 00:11:26,364
Barman, was the vodka straight?
Yes sir.

119
00:11:26,799 --> 00:11:31,474
A straight vodka leaves no stains
on uniforms and honor.

120
00:11:51,799 --> 00:11:57,280
You have declared your consent
before the Catholic Church.

121
00:11:57,480 --> 00:11:59,920
Lord, bless this couple.

122
00:12:00,120 --> 00:12:04,140
In the name of the Father,
of the Son, and of the Holy Spirit.

123
00:12:04,240 --> 00:12:07,980
Lord, bless and consecrate
those two rings as a symbol...

124
00:12:08,080 --> 00:12:11,380
of their love.
Through Christ our Lord.

125
00:12:11,480 --> 00:12:15,135
Exchange the rings
to seal your sacred vows.

126
00:12:17,080 --> 00:12:19,080
Take this ring...

127
00:12:19,240 --> 00:12:22,385
as a sign of my love and fidelity.

128
00:12:36,399 --> 00:12:38,399
Take this ring...

129
00:12:38,559 --> 00:12:41,704
as a sign of my love and fidelity.

130
00:13:06,480 --> 00:13:09,400
Kiss. Kiss. Kiss. Kiss.

131
00:13:20,679 --> 00:13:22,659
Will you return?
I will.

132
00:13:22,759 --> 00:13:24,759
Say it.

133
00:13:25,840 --> 00:13:27,840
I will.

134
00:13:28,320 --> 00:13:30,320
Promise me you will.

135
00:13:42,159 --> 00:13:44,159
I promise.

136
00:15:21,840 --> 00:15:25,280
HANDS OFF THE SOVIET RUSSIA

137
00:15:27,399 --> 00:15:30,720
BELVEDERE PALACE, WARSAW

138
00:15:31,159 --> 00:15:33,620
Don't you think it's a mistake?

139
00:15:33,720 --> 00:15:37,545
How will the West react
to the Kiev offensive?

140
00:15:38,519 --> 00:15:42,600
I don't care, Prime Minister.
First of all...

141
00:15:42,799 --> 00:15:46,699
we've been at an undeclared war
with the Soviets for a year.

142
00:15:46,799 --> 00:15:50,120
Secondly, our intelligence tells us...

143
00:15:50,480 --> 00:15:56,345
the Soviets are preparing a massive
offensive. We'll pre-empt this.

144
00:15:56,720 --> 00:15:58,720
Thirdly...

145
00:15:59,200 --> 00:16:01,640
or firstly to be precise,

146
00:16:01,840 --> 00:16:06,430
an ethnic Poland would be too
weak to defend herself...

147
00:16:06,440 --> 00:16:09,939
against the White or Red Russia
on the East...

148
00:16:10,039 --> 00:16:12,334
and Germany on the West.

149
00:16:15,559 --> 00:16:17,800
That's why I opt for...

150
00:16:18,320 --> 00:16:21,550
a federation of independent states,

151
00:16:21,559 --> 00:16:25,638
the nations used to live
on the Polish territory.

152
00:16:25,639 --> 00:16:30,400
And that is why I acceded
to Hetman Petliura's request...

153
00:16:30,600 --> 00:16:35,530
to help him liberate Ukraine
from the Bolshevist plague.

154
00:16:37,279 --> 00:16:43,520
Once we take Kiev...
we'll give it back to the Ukrainians.

155
00:16:58,799 --> 00:17:02,000
What's your sweet decoy?

156
00:17:02,720 --> 00:17:05,865
Why are you attracting why are you...

157
00:17:06,440 --> 00:17:09,245
attracting every handsome boy?

158
00:17:10,279 --> 00:17:13,424
Why are you attracting why are you...

159
00:17:14,119 --> 00:17:16,924
attracting every handsome boy?

160
00:17:17,920 --> 00:17:21,580
To your 1ances, fear at bay
Drive the Bolsheviks away.

161
00:17:21,680 --> 00:17:26,185
To your 1ances, fear at bay
Drive the Bolsheviks away.

162
00:17:33,240 --> 00:17:36,520
There's no fate that could be worse:

163
00:17:37,160 --> 00:17:40,220
Being knocked down off your horse...

164
00:17:40,839 --> 00:17:44,069
fellow soldiers just ride on ahead.

165
00:17:44,720 --> 00:17:48,040
Trampling you until you're dead.

166
00:17:48,640 --> 00:17:53,145
To your 1ances, fear at bay
Drive the Bolsheviks away.

167
00:17:56,319 --> 00:18:00,824
To your 1ances, fear at bay
Drive the Bolsheviks away.

168
00:18:01,559 --> 00:18:04,160
Ladies and gentlemen.

169
00:18:05,680 --> 00:18:07,975
Great news.
Kiev has fallen.

170
00:18:50,920 --> 00:18:53,880
BELVEDERE PALACE, WARSAW

171
00:19:09,880 --> 00:19:13,620
Please accept my most sincere
congratulations, Marshall.

172
00:19:13,720 --> 00:19:16,525
An excellent victory.
I was wrong.

173
00:19:17,319 --> 00:19:19,540
Unless the Ukrainians
support Hetman Petliura...

174
00:19:19,640 --> 00:19:24,400
this victory shall slip
through our fingers like sand.

175
00:20:55,279 --> 00:20:57,829
Budyonny's First Cavalry Army.

176
00:20:58,599 --> 00:21:01,999
Photographed by our American volunteers.

177
00:21:02,279 --> 00:21:05,080
Not to worry.
Excuse me?

178
00:21:05,680 --> 00:21:09,250
Cavalry is of no significance in this war.

179
00:21:09,880 --> 00:21:13,520
It's an entire army,
not just one squad.

180
00:21:13,720 --> 00:21:16,540
That's insignificant.
Even Napoleon's cavalry...

181
00:21:16,640 --> 00:21:20,179
couldn't break through the infantry lines.

182
00:21:20,279 --> 00:21:24,104
And we have machine guns,
tanks, and aircraft.

183
00:21:24,319 --> 00:21:29,164
True. We have one tank regiment
and one aircraft squadron.

184
00:21:29,759 --> 00:21:33,669
The days of cavalry are over,
my dear Wieniawa.

185
00:21:34,880 --> 00:21:39,300
THE POLISH-BOLSHEVIK FRONT LINE IN UKRAINE
Your saber reminds me of a meat cleaver.

186
00:21:39,400 --> 00:21:43,900
Yours is a Russian piece of shit.
It chopped enough of you, Prussians.

187
00:21:44,000 --> 00:21:45,739
But we kicked your asses.

188
00:21:45,839 --> 00:21:48,739
That's because the Czarina was German.

189
00:21:48,839 --> 00:21:52,919
Shut up, you two,
or they'll catch you off guard.

190
00:21:54,559 --> 00:21:56,559
Oh...

191
00:21:57,440 --> 00:21:59,440
Lermontov.

192
00:22:00,599 --> 00:22:03,064
Leave that Soviet propaganda.

193
00:22:04,000 --> 00:22:08,250
That's Lermontov.
Their commissar? Throw it away.

194
00:22:11,039 --> 00:22:14,864
Let's go back,
the Bolsheviks've split, chief.

195
00:22:15,359 --> 00:22:19,840
We're missing lunch.
You like horse meat so much?

196
00:22:20,119 --> 00:22:23,419
Like the Bolsheviks say:
existence influences the consciousness.

197
00:22:23,519 --> 00:22:26,239
I see you're fascinated by them.

198
00:22:26,279 --> 00:22:28,739
They give people land.
And land is worth more than life,

199
00:22:28,839 --> 00:22:31,739
just like a horse is worth more
than a woman. Right?

200
00:22:31,839 --> 00:22:34,559
You've fucking talked him round.

201
00:22:35,160 --> 00:22:37,160
Me?

202
00:22:39,519 --> 00:22:41,519
Charming.

203
00:22:43,160 --> 00:22:45,160
A charming photo, look.

204
00:22:46,480 --> 00:22:49,440
'Our troops are like patchwork.'.

205
00:22:49,799 --> 00:22:51,419
They all speak Polish,

206
00:22:51,519 --> 00:22:55,979
but all they do is boast
who served where during the Great War.

207
00:22:56,079 --> 00:22:57,699
And conflicts arise.

208
00:22:57,799 --> 00:23:03,019
Ex Russians cuirassiers versus
ex Prussian hussars or ex Austrian soldiers.

209
00:23:03,119 --> 00:23:05,380
There's no sign of the Bolsheviks,

210
00:23:05,480 --> 00:23:09,815
and they say we're to be replaced
by the Ukrainians.

211
00:23:10,720 --> 00:23:15,565
We are stationing on the banks
of the Dnieper and waiting.

212
00:23:15,599 --> 00:23:19,720
I miss the touch of your hands and lips...

213
00:23:21,119 --> 00:23:23,499
And the rest is only for me.

214
00:23:25,759 --> 00:23:27,759
Ah, you.

215
00:23:44,640 --> 00:23:47,020
Got any rolling papers?
No.

216
00:23:48,559 --> 00:23:50,259
Come here.

217
00:23:50,359 --> 00:23:52,359
Here you go.

218
00:23:58,400 --> 00:24:00,219
What's that?

219
00:24:00,319 --> 00:24:04,824
A Bolshevik leaflet.
Just perfect for a roll-your-own.

220
00:24:05,119 --> 00:24:08,349
'Comrade Polska workers and peasants.'.

221
00:24:08,599 --> 00:24:12,339
To our brothers fighting in the Polska army.

222
00:24:13,559 --> 00:24:15,780
You must to strip the Polska authorities...

223
00:24:15,880 --> 00:24:17,659
of any support.

224
00:24:17,759 --> 00:24:22,900
Let the capitalist government
stand their selves alone itself...

225
00:24:23,000 --> 00:24:26,485
against the Russia-Polska proletariat.

226
00:24:26,759 --> 00:24:31,340
Alone against the power
of the revolutions state'. Slick.

227
00:24:31,440 --> 00:24:33,439
You're agitating?

228
00:24:33,440 --> 00:24:35,179
But...
Shut up.

229
00:24:35,279 --> 00:24:38,000
I'm not deaf. What's that?

230
00:24:38,240 --> 00:24:40,240
Nothing.

231
00:24:41,240 --> 00:24:43,240
A picture of a whore?

232
00:24:51,599 --> 00:24:53,599
You son of a bitch.

233
00:25:16,400 --> 00:25:18,400
Keep it up.

234
00:25:18,599 --> 00:25:20,179
Good job.

235
00:25:20,279 --> 00:25:22,279
Bravo.

236
00:25:32,400 --> 00:25:35,960
Come on, chief.
I'm arresting you...

237
00:25:36,480 --> 00:25:41,019
for assaulting your superior
and for Bolshevik agitation.

238
00:25:41,119 --> 00:25:44,944
It's awfully hot in here.
Le's wrap this up.

239
00:25:49,880 --> 00:25:51,880
All rise.

240
00:25:56,599 --> 00:26:00,259
Having been proven guilty
of sowing defeatism...

241
00:26:00,359 --> 00:26:04,269
platoon leader Jan Krynicki is sentenced...

242
00:26:04,720 --> 00:26:07,270
to death by firing squad...

243
00:26:07,960 --> 00:26:10,680
and will be executed at dawn.

244
00:26:14,480 --> 00:26:16,480
Executed?

245
00:26:20,359 --> 00:26:22,484
Take him away.
What for?

246
00:26:26,559 --> 00:26:28,840
What for? I'm innocent.

247
00:26:31,799 --> 00:26:33,799
Say something.

248
00:26:36,480 --> 00:26:38,480
I didn't do anything.

249
00:27:30,000 --> 00:27:32,000
Lord, have mercy.

250
00:27:34,119 --> 00:27:36,259
No one said a word in his defense.

251
00:27:36,359 --> 00:27:39,720
Say it yourself.
I will.

252
00:27:39,960 --> 00:27:44,890
You'll get into trouble.
And if he really is a Bolshevik?

253
00:27:45,279 --> 00:27:47,574
The Reds.
Battle stations.

254
00:28:55,400 --> 00:28:57,400
Come in.

255
00:28:59,039 --> 00:29:00,699
Bolek.

256
00:29:00,799 --> 00:29:02,839
What are you doing here?

257
00:29:09,559 --> 00:29:11,559
What's wrong?

258
00:29:13,960 --> 00:29:15,960
Ola...

259
00:29:16,640 --> 00:29:19,080
I have bad news.
No...

260
00:29:22,200 --> 00:29:25,855
Jan's squad
was wiped out by the Bolsheviks.

261
00:29:28,079 --> 00:29:30,289
He's dead?
We don't know.

262
00:29:32,640 --> 00:29:34,850
He's dead.
We don't know.

263
00:30:18,039 --> 00:30:23,600
Spring has come
And all white roses bloom.

264
00:30:24,799 --> 00:30:30,360
Come back, Johnny,
Come back to me soon.

265
00:30:31,759 --> 00:30:34,520
Come and kiss me.

266
00:30:35,279 --> 00:30:37,279
Come and hold me close.

267
00:30:38,640 --> 00:30:40,640
And I will reward you.

268
00:30:40,680 --> 00:30:43,240
With the sweetest rose.

269
00:30:45,480 --> 00:30:48,160
Come and kiss me.

270
00:30:49,160 --> 00:30:51,240
Come and hold me close.

271
00:30:52,319 --> 00:30:54,840
And I will reward you.

272
00:30:55,759 --> 00:30:58,160
With the sweetest rose.

273
00:30:59,160 --> 00:31:04,480
My poor Johnny Lays deep in the tomb.

274
00:31:06,079 --> 00:31:11,640
And white roses flower in full bloom.

275
00:31:13,680 --> 00:31:17,040
Wav down vender.

276
00:31:18,440 --> 00:31:20,520
A new rosebush grows.

277
00:31:22,119 --> 00:31:25,080
On poor soldier's grave.

278
00:31:26,279 --> 00:31:30,000
There blooms the sweetest rose.

279
00:31:37,559 --> 00:31:39,559
'Marushka'.

280
00:31:41,000 --> 00:31:44,440
Our lads are on position.

281
00:31:48,440 --> 00:31:50,300
They don't fear the damn Bolsheviks.

282
00:31:50,400 --> 00:31:53,840
They just mock them All the time.

283
00:31:56,160 --> 00:31:57,259
Everybody.

284
00:31:57,359 --> 00:32:00,680
Marushka, my dear Marushka.

285
00:32:01,079 --> 00:32:04,480
Come and sleep with me.

286
00:32:21,000 --> 00:32:25,680
Says here you were to be shot
for being a communist.

287
00:32:28,319 --> 00:32:30,319
You're a party member?

288
00:32:32,960 --> 00:32:35,600
No. I was wrongly accused.

289
00:32:37,559 --> 00:32:39,559
Wrongly?

290
00:32:42,240 --> 00:32:44,790
What are your political views?

291
00:32:46,440 --> 00:32:48,440
Progressive.

292
00:32:49,279 --> 00:32:52,000
A non-party communist.

293
00:32:52,200 --> 00:32:54,200
Not precisely.

294
00:32:55,160 --> 00:32:58,659
I need someone to write leaflets in Polish.

295
00:32:58,759 --> 00:33:01,280
They exiled me in 1905.

296
00:33:01,480 --> 00:33:03,640
So my Polish is rusty.

297
00:33:04,279 --> 00:33:06,880
Let's get one thing clear.

298
00:33:07,880 --> 00:33:11,025
You're talking to Commissar Bykowski.

299
00:33:11,440 --> 00:33:13,440
I'm a Chekist.

300
00:33:13,640 --> 00:33:15,920
You've heard of the Cheka?

301
00:33:18,440 --> 00:33:20,739
Yes. You're the secret police.

302
00:33:20,839 --> 00:33:23,120
Nothing of the sort.

303
00:33:23,480 --> 00:33:25,019
Che-ka:

304
00:33:25,119 --> 00:33:30,304
the Extraordinary Commission
for Combating Counter-Revolution.

305
00:33:30,319 --> 00:33:33,804
The greatest invention of our revolution.

306
00:33:34,279 --> 00:33:38,104
The French Revolution
invented the guillotine.

307
00:33:38,200 --> 00:33:42,499
Which was... a step forward
from beheading with an axe.

308
00:33:42,599 --> 00:33:48,380
But the guillotine's output was small,
so the French Revolution failed.

309
00:33:48,480 --> 00:33:52,360
Meanwhile the Cheka's output is so big...

310
00:33:53,680 --> 00:33:57,979
that before the Red Revolution
takes over the globe,

311
00:33:58,079 --> 00:34:02,219
all the enemies of the people
will have been eliminated.

312
00:34:02,319 --> 00:34:04,319
Is that clear?

313
00:34:07,319 --> 00:34:09,480
I think so.
Wrong.

314
00:34:10,159 --> 00:34:14,139
You don't think in the Cheka,
unless you are Comrade Dzerzhinsky.

315
00:34:14,239 --> 00:34:17,800
Our job is to keep the output up.

316
00:34:24,639 --> 00:34:27,280
Why are you staring like that?

317
00:34:30,599 --> 00:34:32,599
Attractive, huh?

318
00:34:33,480 --> 00:34:36,419
A lot of guys would like a piece of that.

319
00:34:36,519 --> 00:34:39,000
But only I may fuck her.

320
00:34:39,559 --> 00:34:43,160
She's my war wife.
Sofia Nikolayevna.

321
00:34:44,199 --> 00:34:47,440
A wild thing,
impossible to tame.

322
00:34:48,239 --> 00:34:51,840
Used to be the wife of a Czarist colonel.

323
00:34:54,119 --> 00:34:56,960
We hanged the bastard.

324
00:34:58,280 --> 00:35:01,360
Come on. Make some tea.

325
00:35:06,079 --> 00:35:09,059
You'll continue to wear your uniform.

326
00:35:09,159 --> 00:35:13,324
Let people see we've recruited
some Poles as well.

327
00:35:37,880 --> 00:35:41,840
Welcome,
distinguished Polish gentlemen.

328
00:35:49,639 --> 00:35:51,639
Which one accused you?

329
00:35:54,239 --> 00:35:56,440
I'm not seeking revenge.

330
00:35:56,639 --> 00:36:00,880
Bourgeois morality?
All right.

331
00:36:03,719 --> 00:36:05,719
Bielski.

332
00:36:06,320 --> 00:36:08,320
Ah, that's you?

333
00:36:08,719 --> 00:36:10,960
Do forgive me, Major.

334
00:36:11,559 --> 00:36:15,900
You were the judge yesterday,
today you are being judged.

335
00:36:16,000 --> 00:36:18,480
You win some, you lose some.

336
00:36:18,800 --> 00:36:22,200
What goes round comes around.
Tough luck.

337
00:36:26,599 --> 00:36:31,440
That's people's justice,
as comrade Dzerzhinsky calls it.

338
00:36:34,480 --> 00:36:36,800
All officers step forward.

339
00:36:45,840 --> 00:36:48,220
Take them for interrogation.

340
00:36:52,599 --> 00:36:56,320
Soldiers,
we are going to Poland.

341
00:36:56,719 --> 00:36:59,000
Not to conquer her.

342
00:36:59,199 --> 00:37:03,780
To free her workers and peasants
from the bourgeois regime.

343
00:37:03,880 --> 00:37:08,780
To get rid of your nobles
and establish the people's republic.

344
00:37:08,880 --> 00:37:13,215
Who will join the Red Army?
Volunteers step forward.

345
00:37:22,280 --> 00:37:25,425
What was that?
They tried to escape.

346
00:37:25,920 --> 00:37:30,240
Bloody hell... There's no one
to interrogate again.

347
00:37:31,159 --> 00:37:33,159
Take them away.

348
00:38:04,280 --> 00:38:06,745
Did anyone witness his death?

349
00:38:08,760 --> 00:38:10,760
No.

350
00:38:12,039 --> 00:38:14,120
Then believe he's alive.

351
00:38:14,760 --> 00:38:17,200
Delude myself?
No.

352
00:38:17,400 --> 00:38:19,400
Believe.

353
00:38:19,719 --> 00:38:22,184
Everything is in God's hands.

354
00:38:24,679 --> 00:38:26,920
I'll celebrate that mass.

355
00:38:27,360 --> 00:38:30,335
But we won't pray for Jan's soul...

356
00:38:30,360 --> 00:38:32,360
but for his return.

357
00:39:11,239 --> 00:39:13,239
Comrades.

358
00:39:14,039 --> 00:39:16,504
There are no masters anymore.

359
00:39:16,840 --> 00:39:19,640
We are in power now.

360
00:39:20,159 --> 00:39:22,794
All that you see here is yours.

361
00:39:22,960 --> 00:39:27,465
To prove this we'll appoint
a revolutionary committee.

362
00:39:27,760 --> 00:39:29,760
Name your candidates.

363
00:39:33,679 --> 00:39:35,920
Don't be shy, comrades.

364
00:39:38,719 --> 00:39:40,719
I see you need help.

365
00:39:44,679 --> 00:39:46,679
You.

366
00:39:50,400 --> 00:39:52,400
You.

367
00:39:55,440 --> 00:39:57,440
You.

368
00:39:58,599 --> 00:40:00,599
You.

369
00:40:01,480 --> 00:40:03,480
You.

370
00:40:08,199 --> 00:40:10,720
Who is against this choice?

371
00:40:11,559 --> 00:40:13,559
Who is abstaining?

372
00:40:14,079 --> 00:40:16,079
Nobody.

373
00:40:16,559 --> 00:40:19,720
They have been unanimously approved.

374
00:40:54,960 --> 00:40:59,220
The palaces and mansions
will belong to the working class,

375
00:40:59,320 --> 00:41:02,160
not to damned bourgeois families.

376
00:41:02,920 --> 00:41:07,619
But first you will turn the buildings
into shithouses, right?

377
00:41:07,719 --> 00:41:09,260
What?

378
00:41:09,360 --> 00:41:14,539
Your intelligentsia nose feels
offended by the smell of shit, huh?

379
00:41:14,639 --> 00:41:16,220
Let me explain.

380
00:41:16,320 --> 00:41:21,505
Where did the farmers and workers
shove their dear exploiters?

381
00:41:21,599 --> 00:41:23,599
Up their asses.

382
00:41:23,679 --> 00:41:26,654
Capitalism lay heavy on their guts.

383
00:41:26,719 --> 00:41:29,900
Now they have to shit it out and feel free.

384
00:41:30,000 --> 00:41:32,000
Got that?

385
00:42:02,519 --> 00:42:04,340
Why did you stay here?

386
00:42:04,440 --> 00:42:08,059
The masters run away,
the servants hid in the village.

387
00:42:08,159 --> 00:42:10,960
Who's going to tend the cows?

388
00:42:11,159 --> 00:42:14,180
The cows?
Yeah. They need to be fed...

389
00:42:14,280 --> 00:42:17,085
and milked.
Leave this place.

390
00:42:17,840 --> 00:42:19,459
Not to worry.

391
00:42:19,559 --> 00:42:21,559
Not to worry.

392
00:42:35,719 --> 00:42:38,320
No. Let me go. Let go.

393
00:42:45,440 --> 00:42:47,440
Piss off.

394
00:42:57,960 --> 00:42:59,700
Learn to knock...

395
00:42:59,800 --> 00:43:01,800
or I'll shoot you.

396
00:43:02,599 --> 00:43:06,320
Stop staring. I've got piles.
Shut the door.

397
00:43:06,519 --> 00:43:08,880
Come on, more hot water.

398
00:43:14,880 --> 00:43:18,560
Careful. Don't boil my nuts.

399
00:43:21,239 --> 00:43:24,700
What's the rush?
They're raping a girl in the barn.

400
00:43:24,800 --> 00:43:25,939
It's all right.

401
00:43:26,039 --> 00:43:29,200
The boys 'wannee fuckee'.
What?

402
00:43:30,239 --> 00:43:35,059
'Wannee fuckee'. One Chino's
way of saying 'I needed a fuck'.

403
00:43:35,159 --> 00:43:40,300
They shot him, not for raping
an old hag, but for leaving his post.

404
00:43:40,400 --> 00:43:43,715
If every 'wannee fuckee' left his post,

405
00:43:43,840 --> 00:43:46,780
we'd have lost the Revolution long ago.

406
00:43:46,880 --> 00:43:48,880
Don't you understand?

407
00:43:49,079 --> 00:43:52,939
The Red Army is supposed
to free the oppressed masses,

408
00:43:53,039 --> 00:43:56,949
not to gang rape them.
What oppressed masses?

409
00:43:57,280 --> 00:44:01,530
They're not doing the landlady?
No, the milkmaid.

410
00:44:01,880 --> 00:44:03,880
A proletarian?

411
00:44:04,000 --> 00:44:06,000
Motherfuckers.

412
00:44:13,360 --> 00:44:15,480
Brave lads.

413
00:44:15,679 --> 00:44:17,840
Eager to fuck,

414
00:44:18,559 --> 00:44:20,760
reluctant to fess up?

415
00:44:24,360 --> 00:44:26,655
You don't recognize anyone?

416
00:44:27,920 --> 00:44:31,440
How? I had the skirt over my face.

417
00:44:33,800 --> 00:44:35,800
Who went first?

418
00:44:36,880 --> 00:44:38,880
Who? You?

419
00:44:39,119 --> 00:44:41,244
No, comrade Commissioner.

420
00:44:41,440 --> 00:44:43,440
You?

421
00:44:43,639 --> 00:44:45,764
No, comrade Commissioner.

422
00:44:47,599 --> 00:44:50,149
You'll find out anyway. I did.

423
00:44:52,599 --> 00:44:55,260
And you are...?
Ivanov, soldier.

424
00:44:55,360 --> 00:44:57,619
Enemy of the people, you mean.

425
00:44:57,719 --> 00:44:59,960
You'll be shot.
What for?

426
00:45:00,159 --> 00:45:03,200
For... hostile activities.

427
00:45:04,039 --> 00:45:06,039
Are you satisfied?

428
00:45:06,719 --> 00:45:09,184
It doesn't make a difference.

429
00:45:09,920 --> 00:45:13,320
No one will marry a dishonored girl.

430
00:45:14,079 --> 00:45:16,799
Not even a widower or a cripple.

431
00:45:17,320 --> 00:45:19,840
So that's how you see it?

432
00:45:20,400 --> 00:45:22,720
Ivanov.
Yes, comrade?

433
00:45:23,199 --> 00:45:26,840
If you marry her, I won't shoot you.

434
00:45:28,400 --> 00:45:30,059
I'd rather be shot.

435
00:45:30,159 --> 00:45:32,159
Why's that?

436
00:45:33,599 --> 00:45:36,200
They'll kill me with laughter.

437
00:45:36,559 --> 00:45:38,559
Will you?

438
00:45:49,199 --> 00:45:51,240
He made his choice.

439
00:45:52,159 --> 00:45:56,380
Comrade Dzerzhinsky used to say
that the ringleader...

440
00:45:56,480 --> 00:45:58,480
must be eliminated.

441
00:45:58,559 --> 00:46:02,780
Anyone who's first at anything
may be a threat to the Revolution.

442
00:46:02,880 --> 00:46:05,539
That's why we execute the officers.

443
00:46:05,639 --> 00:46:08,260
An army without commanders
is not an army.

444
00:46:08,360 --> 00:46:12,100
And a nation without leaders
is not a nation.

445
00:46:13,039 --> 00:46:15,039
Right?

446
00:46:17,679 --> 00:46:20,000
Good evening, Alexandra.

447
00:46:20,800 --> 00:46:23,040
You do recognize me?

448
00:46:23,800 --> 00:46:26,080
What brings you here?

449
00:46:28,840 --> 00:46:32,640
I take it you've already heard the news...

450
00:46:33,960 --> 00:46:36,680
about your husband's treason.

451
00:46:36,840 --> 00:46:40,680
I'm so sorry.
Treason? What do you mean?

452
00:46:41,440 --> 00:46:43,600
So you didn't know?

453
00:46:43,800 --> 00:46:46,099
He has joined the Bolsheviks.

454
00:46:46,199 --> 00:46:48,199
He's alive?

455
00:46:48,800 --> 00:46:52,880
He survived?
He did, which is most unfortunate.

456
00:46:56,039 --> 00:47:00,539
You don't seem to appreciate
the gravity of the situation.

457
00:47:00,639 --> 00:47:03,840
Should his treason be publicized,

458
00:47:04,039 --> 00:47:07,354
you're likely to be fired and interned.

459
00:47:10,000 --> 00:47:12,000
How so?

460
00:47:12,559 --> 00:47:14,559
Unless...

461
00:47:15,159 --> 00:47:18,640
a person of irrefutable reputation...

462
00:47:18,840 --> 00:47:21,390
vouches for your innocence.

463
00:47:22,079 --> 00:47:24,240
A person like yourself?

464
00:47:25,360 --> 00:47:27,360
At your service.

465
00:47:30,320 --> 00:47:32,720
Why would you do that?

466
00:47:35,559 --> 00:47:38,619
Let's say I have a weakness for you.

467
00:47:39,920 --> 00:47:44,280
Build up your strength with vitamins.
Good night.

468
00:47:45,000 --> 00:47:47,000
Listen to me, doll.

469
00:47:48,000 --> 00:47:51,019
Are you really so eager to be interned?

470
00:47:51,119 --> 00:47:54,820
To be raped with a toilet brush
three times a day?

471
00:47:54,920 --> 00:47:56,920
Think it over.

472
00:48:00,440 --> 00:48:03,560
You'll find my card in the bouquet.

473
00:48:33,159 --> 00:48:36,729
Our Tukhachevsky's a pure military genius.

474
00:48:36,880 --> 00:48:40,380
The Poles think
that the track width difference...

475
00:48:40,480 --> 00:48:45,070
makes it harder to supply
provisions and ammunition.

476
00:48:45,199 --> 00:48:48,854
Meanwhile, twenty thousand
peasant wagons...

477
00:48:49,159 --> 00:48:51,280
solve the problem.

478
00:48:52,119 --> 00:48:54,924
We'll reach Warsaw in a few days.

479
00:49:00,639 --> 00:49:02,880
Airplanes? Airplanes.

480
00:49:03,159 --> 00:49:05,159
Airplanes.

481
00:49:44,559 --> 00:49:46,559
Move it.

482
00:50:10,480 --> 00:50:12,560
Farewell, comrade.

483
00:50:13,480 --> 00:50:14,579
What?

484
00:50:14,679 --> 00:50:17,180
I'm joining my people.
You? A communist?

485
00:50:17,280 --> 00:50:19,830
You've cured me. Once for all.

486
00:50:19,840 --> 00:50:21,840
You bastard.

487
00:50:21,920 --> 00:50:24,640
It's empty. I counted the shots.

488
00:50:25,079 --> 00:50:27,400
Sofia, give me the pistol.

489
00:50:27,599 --> 00:50:29,300
Quick.

490
00:50:29,400 --> 00:50:31,400
What...?

491
00:50:34,480 --> 00:50:36,480
You bitch.

492
00:50:39,800 --> 00:50:40,979
Come on.

493
00:50:41,079 --> 00:50:43,079
Come with me, quick.

494
00:50:48,239 --> 00:50:50,239
Too late...

495
00:50:50,719 --> 00:50:52,719
I...

496
00:50:54,360 --> 00:50:56,360
my soul is sinful...

497
00:50:58,679 --> 00:51:01,280
But wanted to live so much.

498
00:51:03,639 --> 00:51:05,639
Death...

499
00:51:07,079 --> 00:51:09,079
scared me so...

500
00:51:13,920 --> 00:51:16,880
Light... a candle...

501
00:51:18,400 --> 00:51:21,120
at the Holy Virgin's altar...

502
00:51:21,880 --> 00:51:24,260
for the Lord's servant...

503
00:51:26,920 --> 00:51:28,920
Sofia...

504
00:51:29,239 --> 00:51:31,239
Nikolayevna...

505
00:51:32,280 --> 00:51:34,960
I'm not a Russian Orthodox.

506
00:51:36,679 --> 00:51:39,080
We are all children...

507
00:51:39,280 --> 00:51:41,280
of one God...

508
00:52:12,880 --> 00:52:15,360
What do you eat?
Get up.

509
00:52:15,639 --> 00:52:17,639
Faster.

510
00:52:25,679 --> 00:52:28,824
Don't shoot, you'll ruin the uniform.

511
00:52:39,239 --> 00:52:41,704
Great shoes. Let's take them.

512
00:52:43,039 --> 00:52:45,039
Take off your shoes.

513
00:52:59,119 --> 00:53:01,119
Kill them.

514
00:53:13,159 --> 00:53:15,159
Bravo, Mister Lancer.

515
00:53:15,519 --> 00:53:18,664
But one man in a field is no warrior.

516
00:53:19,081 --> 00:53:21,241
The first bullet that hit.

517
00:53:21,641 --> 00:53:25,636
The first bullet that hit
wounded my horse's leg.

518
00:53:26,561 --> 00:53:28,841
And the second bullet.

519
00:53:29,201 --> 00:53:31,481
And the second bullet.

520
00:53:33,721 --> 00:53:36,601
And the second bullet hit...

521
00:53:37,440 --> 00:53:39,440
me in the heart.

522
00:53:39,800 --> 00:53:43,710
What made you, Cossacks,
come over to our side?

523
00:53:44,960 --> 00:53:48,615
What do you gain
shooting your own people...

524
00:53:49,161 --> 00:53:51,201
for Poland's sake?

525
00:53:53,560 --> 00:53:55,961
This is not about Poland.

526
00:53:56,160 --> 00:53:58,881
You are fighting for Poland.

527
00:54:00,080 --> 00:54:02,780
But if the Bolsheviks defeat you,

528
00:54:02,880 --> 00:54:05,515
we'll lose our freedom as well.

529
00:54:07,560 --> 00:54:09,770
Who did you leave at home?

530
00:54:13,160 --> 00:54:15,160
My wife.

531
00:54:17,080 --> 00:54:19,080
Buddy...

532
00:54:19,601 --> 00:54:22,481
You have a lot to fight for.

533
00:54:25,560 --> 00:54:29,441
And al I that's left for me... is my revenge.

534
00:54:52,241 --> 00:54:55,046
Don't you have anything stronger?

535
00:54:55,681 --> 00:54:57,681
I'll take a look.

536
00:54:59,321 --> 00:55:03,996
Would you care to dance?
Can't we just get on with it?

537
00:55:06,601 --> 00:55:09,201
Well then... get undressed.

538
00:55:28,921 --> 00:55:30,920
What the fuck...?

539
00:55:30,921 --> 00:55:33,940
'What the fuck'?
There are ladies present.

540
00:55:34,040 --> 00:55:35,460
Jesus...
The nose.

541
00:55:35,560 --> 00:55:40,421
All right, little bug, some champagne
and some rectified spirit.

542
00:55:40,521 --> 00:55:44,500
Or 'the flames of Moscow'
as the Russians put it.

543
00:55:44,600 --> 00:55:46,600
Ladies' health.

544
00:55:46,641 --> 00:55:48,301
Bottoms up.

545
00:55:48,401 --> 00:55:50,401
Bottoms up.

546
00:55:56,720 --> 00:55:59,581
Who are you?
A Bolshevik, a real one.

547
00:55:59,681 --> 00:56:01,681
Please, back off.

548
00:56:02,120 --> 00:56:03,661
Get back.

549
00:56:03,761 --> 00:56:06,311
What's going on?
A Bolshevik.

550
00:56:06,401 --> 00:56:07,541
You.

551
00:56:07,641 --> 00:56:09,641
Hands up.

552
00:56:20,880 --> 00:56:22,581
There.

553
00:56:22,681 --> 00:56:24,460
Our dear captain...

554
00:56:24,560 --> 00:56:28,130
has been demoted and sent to the front.

555
00:56:30,521 --> 00:56:32,521
Victory.

556
00:56:33,241 --> 00:56:36,131
At war, if you flee, you're wrong.

557
00:56:38,481 --> 00:56:41,381
You were defeated in all Russia, too.

558
00:56:41,481 --> 00:56:43,661
Not all of us and not everywhere.

559
00:56:43,761 --> 00:56:47,101
As they say, a forest will always grow back.

560
00:56:47,201 --> 00:56:49,281
They can't slay us all,

561
00:56:49,720 --> 00:56:52,401
and we will keep slaying them.

562
00:57:08,880 --> 00:57:10,880
Fuck me...

563
00:57:11,440 --> 00:57:13,220
I had no idea.

564
00:57:13,320 --> 00:57:15,320
Careful. Careful.

565
00:57:39,920 --> 00:57:43,320
People of Poznan are deeply concerned...

566
00:57:43,761 --> 00:57:46,541
by the developments at the front.

567
00:57:46,641 --> 00:57:49,861
They can't understand,
and suspect treason.

568
00:57:49,961 --> 00:57:52,721
And it seeks treason right here.

569
00:58:04,401 --> 00:58:08,681
All men to the trenches.
All men to the trenches.

570
00:58:09,001 --> 00:58:12,461
All men, join the army.
Aren't you ashamed?

571
00:58:12,561 --> 00:58:16,901
Draft dodgers, break your tethers,
stop growing yellow feathers.

572
00:58:17,001 --> 00:58:19,466
Draft dodgers. Skulking rats.

573
00:58:19,521 --> 00:58:21,561
What the devil is that?

574
00:58:22,001 --> 00:58:25,061
Volunteers joining the army.
Women?

575
00:58:25,680 --> 00:58:28,001
Gentlemen, we're saved.

576
00:58:28,201 --> 00:58:32,026
The Bolsheviks will just run for their lives.

577
00:58:32,160 --> 00:58:33,901
Gentlemen?

578
00:58:34,001 --> 00:58:36,180
How can we help you, madam?

579
00:58:36,280 --> 00:58:39,085
We're raising money for bandages.

580
00:58:39,160 --> 00:58:41,455
Will you support the cause?

581
00:58:41,521 --> 00:58:44,921
Of course.
Gentlemen, this is our duty.

582
00:58:47,240 --> 00:58:49,240
Thank you so much.

583
00:58:49,720 --> 00:58:51,720
Ola.

584
00:58:52,401 --> 00:58:55,521
Good morning. How are things?

585
00:58:57,840 --> 00:58:59,380
You look worried.

586
00:58:59,480 --> 00:59:01,641
We all worry nowadays.

587
00:59:01,840 --> 00:59:06,005
One has to act, sweetie. Act.
I'm on my last legs,

588
00:59:06,121 --> 00:59:09,940
but I can't be idle
when our soldiers suffer at the front.

589
00:59:10,040 --> 00:59:12,841
So I devote myself.
To what?

590
00:59:13,040 --> 00:59:16,521
To charity.
Day in, day out.

591
00:59:17,040 --> 00:59:18,180
A raffle,

592
00:59:18,280 --> 00:59:22,190
a charity ball
to send our soldiers some candy.

593
00:59:22,401 --> 00:59:24,401
Wonderful.

594
00:59:30,121 --> 00:59:32,121
I admire patriotism,

595
00:59:32,321 --> 00:59:36,061
but that is going overboard.
Don't you agree?

596
00:59:37,561 --> 00:59:41,441
A woman is destined to be a woman.

597
00:59:43,641 --> 00:59:45,641
You're right.

598
00:59:56,720 --> 00:59:58,720
Stop.

599
01:00:03,521 --> 01:00:05,861
Now you look for your people,

600
01:00:05,961 --> 01:00:07,961
and I'll look for mine.

601
01:00:08,600 --> 01:00:11,745
Good luck, Pole.
It's time to split.

602
01:00:14,001 --> 01:00:16,301
God willing, we'll meet again.

603
01:00:16,401 --> 01:00:18,401
Follow me.

604
01:00:22,401 --> 01:00:28,121
No one will be as dear to me as you.

605
01:00:28,321 --> 01:00:30,801
Only you.

606
01:00:31,761 --> 01:00:37,081
No one's kisses will be so sweet as yours.

607
01:00:37,280 --> 01:00:39,841
None but yours.

608
01:00:41,001 --> 01:00:44,561
Your heart is so kind and sweet.

609
01:00:45,401 --> 01:00:49,001
It can calm and comfort mine.

610
01:00:49,280 --> 01:00:54,641
And my love is once and for all for you.

611
01:00:55,201 --> 01:00:57,201
Only you.

612
01:01:20,521 --> 01:01:22,601
Faster, boys, faster.

613
01:01:26,961 --> 01:01:28,961
Positions.

614
01:01:36,680 --> 01:01:39,241
Nice, isn't it?
Very.

615
01:01:39,441 --> 01:01:41,641
Gun-layer, move over.

616
01:01:42,480 --> 01:01:45,625
Attention.
Get into shooting position.

617
01:01:46,201 --> 01:01:48,901
You don't know how?
I'll demonstrate.

618
01:01:49,001 --> 01:01:51,881
On your knee...
hands on the grip.

619
01:01:52,080 --> 01:01:55,401
Once more. Attention.
Shooting position.

620
01:01:57,080 --> 01:02:00,501
It's like shooting a rifle.
Rear sight... bead.

621
01:02:00,601 --> 01:02:04,086
If it jams, flip it open,
remove the case.

622
01:02:04,320 --> 01:02:06,060
Close the flap,

623
01:02:06,160 --> 01:02:08,401
reload twice, and...

624
01:02:09,920 --> 01:02:11,920
Fire at will.

625
01:02:16,721 --> 01:02:18,921
That's was lousy.

626
01:02:19,121 --> 01:02:21,921
One more time.
Aim...

627
01:02:22,160 --> 01:02:24,160
fire.

628
01:02:28,401 --> 01:02:31,060
That's it. Better.
Did you see that?

629
01:02:31,160 --> 01:02:33,160
That's the way.

630
01:03:13,560 --> 01:03:14,381
Next.

631
01:03:14,481 --> 01:03:16,721
And you?
Cavalry, please.

632
01:03:16,920 --> 01:03:19,470
It's for grownups only, sonny.

633
01:03:19,521 --> 01:03:23,220
But I... I'm eightee...
seventee... I'm sixteen already.

634
01:03:23,320 --> 01:03:26,720
Off you go, or I'll whoop your ass.
Next.

635
01:03:27,001 --> 01:03:31,281
Look here, Mister.
Says I was born in 1904.

636
01:03:31,481 --> 01:03:33,481
Black on white.

637
01:03:35,040 --> 01:03:37,161
Where? There's a blot.

638
01:03:38,280 --> 01:03:42,421
That's not my problem.
You have it there, black on white.

639
01:03:42,521 --> 01:03:45,496
You'll be black and blue.
All right.

640
01:03:45,521 --> 01:03:48,121
Sign the crafty one up.
Next.

641
01:03:48,761 --> 01:03:51,980
All right, youngsters,
medical battalion.

642
01:03:52,080 --> 01:03:54,080
Next.

643
01:03:56,721 --> 01:03:58,721
We're together.

644
01:04:00,761 --> 01:04:03,906
Already had your whiff of gun powder?

645
01:04:04,121 --> 01:04:06,501
It's good for sniffing, too?

646
01:04:09,200 --> 01:04:11,820
We'd like the radiotelegraph service.

647
01:04:11,920 --> 01:04:13,921
Why the radiotelegraph?

648
01:04:14,121 --> 01:04:17,460
Because we know how to operate that crap.

649
01:04:17,560 --> 01:04:20,535
Two years in Austrian signal corps.

650
01:04:20,841 --> 01:04:24,411
It's not enough to fill in for casualties.

651
01:04:24,841 --> 01:04:26,841
We have to breathe...

652
01:04:27,040 --> 01:04:32,401
new life into the ranks
demoralized by the retreat.

653
01:04:33,440 --> 01:04:35,761
You, General Haller,

654
01:04:36,761 --> 01:04:39,980
shall take command of the Volunteer Army.

655
01:04:40,080 --> 01:04:42,079
Thank you, Marshall.

656
01:04:42,080 --> 01:04:45,100
Everyone volunteers in towns and cities.

657
01:04:45,200 --> 01:04:47,920
But the villagers are reluctant.

658
01:04:48,241 --> 01:04:52,321
They seem indifferent
to the Bolshevik invasion.

659
01:04:55,481 --> 01:04:57,481
It will change soon.

660
01:05:00,121 --> 01:05:02,100
Marshall, the Prime Minister.

661
01:05:02,200 --> 01:05:04,200
Excuse me, General.

662
01:05:09,440 --> 01:05:12,700
Limiting the Polish army
to 50 thousand men?

663
01:05:12,800 --> 01:05:18,081
Surrendering surplus arms
and a corridor to East Prussia?

664
01:05:19,521 --> 01:05:23,346
Pulling our troops back
west of the Bug River?

665
01:05:23,641 --> 01:05:27,141
How could you,
you, the Polish Prime Minister,

666
01:05:27,241 --> 01:05:32,441
accept such conditions
of the armistice with the Soviets?

667
01:05:32,920 --> 01:05:35,980
It makes us
completely dependent on Russia.

668
01:05:36,080 --> 01:05:38,290
Our army is not effective.

669
01:05:38,361 --> 01:05:42,601
We shall win...
if we believe in victory.

670
01:05:42,841 --> 01:05:46,411
We will be defeated if we lose that faith.

671
01:05:46,680 --> 01:05:49,801
You have overstepped your authority.

672
01:05:50,521 --> 01:05:53,411
I'll be awaiting your resignation.

673
01:05:53,680 --> 01:05:55,680
I had no choice.

674
01:05:59,721 --> 01:06:02,611
I have nothing else to say to you.

675
01:06:08,320 --> 01:06:10,320
Wieniawa.

676
01:06:13,280 --> 01:06:16,041
Locate Mr. Witos...

677
01:06:16,920 --> 01:06:18,920
and fetch him here.

678
01:06:44,361 --> 01:06:46,361
Mister Chairman.

679
01:06:49,280 --> 01:06:50,621
What is it?

680
01:06:50,721 --> 01:06:54,886
The Head of State is asking you
to come to Warsaw.

681
01:06:56,920 --> 01:06:58,141
I entrust you,

682
01:06:58,241 --> 01:07:01,301
as the widely respected peasant leader,

683
01:07:01,401 --> 01:07:06,220
with the task of creating
the Government of National Unity.

684
01:07:06,320 --> 01:07:08,530
I agree. On one condition.

685
01:07:09,920 --> 01:07:10,980
Yes?

686
01:07:11,080 --> 01:07:15,415
That I shall be able to return home
at harvest time.

687
01:07:17,761 --> 01:07:20,661
Oh well... l have no choice,
but to accept.

688
01:07:20,761 --> 01:07:23,906
How do you intend to start governing?

689
01:07:24,881 --> 01:07:27,941
With an appeal to the Polish people.

690
01:07:29,160 --> 01:07:31,641
Prime Minister Witos' appeal.

691
01:07:31,960 --> 01:07:34,425
Prime Minister Witos' appeal.

692
01:07:34,481 --> 01:07:37,796
Fellow peasants in all parts of Poland.

693
01:07:38,881 --> 01:07:42,501
This is a crucial moment
for us and for our country.

694
01:07:42,601 --> 01:07:45,501
Therefore I do not ask you,
but I demand:

695
01:07:45,601 --> 01:07:48,491
Let each one of you do their duty.

696
01:07:49,560 --> 01:07:51,501
The battlefields, the front...

697
01:07:51,601 --> 01:07:55,340
await all those who are
able to carry a weapon.

698
01:07:55,440 --> 01:07:57,681
Dear peasant sisters,

699
01:07:58,080 --> 01:08:02,755
close your houses and protect
your farmsteads against...

700
01:08:02,841 --> 01:08:04,220
deserters.

701
01:08:04,320 --> 01:08:08,400
You are threatened
with disgrace and destruction,

702
01:08:08,481 --> 01:08:11,940
and they sit at home
avoiding military service.

703
01:08:12,040 --> 01:08:16,120
All borough and village leaders
will make sure...

704
01:08:16,160 --> 01:08:20,621
that not a sole deserter
hides in their settlements.

705
01:08:20,721 --> 01:08:24,631
That every able-bodied villager
joins the army.

706
01:08:30,241 --> 01:08:32,451
THEY FEED AND THEY PROTECT

707
01:08:51,160 --> 01:08:53,721
OUTSKIRTS OF WARSAW

708
01:09:39,361 --> 01:09:41,141
Dismount.

709
01:09:41,241 --> 01:09:43,241
Dismount.

710
01:10:40,480 --> 01:10:42,481
For Sofia Nikolayevna.

711
01:10:44,960 --> 01:10:47,765
You can't pray for your own life.

712
01:10:49,041 --> 01:10:51,961
That would incur the wrath of God.

713
01:10:52,321 --> 01:10:54,140
Why's that?

714
01:10:54,240 --> 01:10:57,555
God has already planned everything out.

715
01:10:57,680 --> 01:10:59,221
Which fly...

716
01:10:59,321 --> 01:11:03,021
sits on which pile of shit.
He won't change His scheme...

717
01:11:03,121 --> 01:11:07,021
just because of someone's prayer,
otherwise we'd be in a great mess.

718
01:11:07,121 --> 01:11:09,501
Don't believe such nonsense.

719
01:11:10,520 --> 01:11:12,520
Nothing's planned out.

720
01:11:40,881 --> 01:11:43,881
RADZYMIN NEAR WARSAW

721
01:11:44,561 --> 01:11:48,021
Marynia, stop shaking
or you'll spill everything.

722
01:11:48,121 --> 01:11:50,121
But they're shooting.

723
01:11:50,440 --> 01:11:53,721
See? They are all cowards.

724
01:11:53,920 --> 01:11:57,380
And yet they call peasants
the 'healthy tissue of society'

725
01:11:57,480 --> 01:12:03,430
as opposed to the sickly upper classes.
And it's the peasants that rot.

726
01:12:04,321 --> 01:12:06,301
Infected with Bolshevism.

727
01:12:06,401 --> 01:12:08,441
I'm rotting?
Not you,

728
01:12:08,680 --> 01:12:11,740
peasants in general.
Scratch my back.

729
01:12:12,321 --> 01:12:14,860
Mrs. Wigctawska nee Matachowska.

730
01:12:14,960 --> 01:12:17,001
Ola Krynicka. Pleasure.

731
01:12:17,321 --> 01:12:19,521
Bolsheviks.

732
01:12:21,160 --> 01:12:23,660
The gun, Marynia.
Jesus Christ.

733
01:12:23,760 --> 01:12:25,759
Stop. Don't.

734
01:12:25,760 --> 01:12:28,041
Evacuate. Evacuate.

735
01:14:07,281 --> 01:14:11,820
Comrades, Delegates to the
2nd Congress of the Comintern.

736
01:14:11,920 --> 01:14:15,241
Today, the invincible Red Army...

737
01:14:15,801 --> 01:14:21,241
captured the town of Radzymin,
15 kilometers away from Warsaw.

738
01:14:21,281 --> 01:14:26,161
In a short time we shall liberate
the capital of Poland...

739
01:14:26,841 --> 01:14:31,181
and then hasten to the rescue
of the revolutionary proletariat...

740
01:14:31,281 --> 01:14:33,281
in Germany.

741
01:14:35,520 --> 01:14:37,261
And we shall also...

742
01:14:37,361 --> 01:14:42,971
hasten to the rescue of the
revolutionary proletariat in France.

743
01:14:44,160 --> 01:14:47,985
Comrades, Delegates
to the Comintern Congress.

744
01:14:48,200 --> 01:14:53,215
We shall start it with the
socialist federation of Europe...

745
01:14:53,760 --> 01:14:57,330
and end it with a worldwide revolution.

746
01:15:33,440 --> 01:15:36,820
We've deciphered
hundreds of Soviet codes.

747
01:15:36,920 --> 01:15:41,340
But the bastards introduced a new one,
impossible to crash.

748
01:15:41,440 --> 01:15:44,500
Have you ever seen anything like it?

749
01:15:46,401 --> 01:15:51,140
Did you do the frequency analysis?
Yes. We've identified some cycles...

750
01:15:51,240 --> 01:15:53,365
but it doesn't add up.

751
01:15:55,881 --> 01:15:59,900
Are you thinking what I'm thinking?
Caesar cipher.

752
01:16:00,000 --> 01:16:02,550
With a double or triple shift.

753
01:16:03,240 --> 01:16:07,021
What are you talking about?
You've been referring...

754
01:16:07,121 --> 01:16:11,781
to the Russian alphabet.
Take the Latin one, with 26 letters.

755
01:16:11,881 --> 01:16:14,321
And you two know Latin?

756
01:16:14,801 --> 01:16:17,721
Ad unum omnes.
'All to a man.'

757
01:16:20,680 --> 01:16:21,820
Marshall...

758
01:16:21,920 --> 01:16:24,100
I've asked not to disturb me.

759
01:16:24,200 --> 01:16:26,181
The head of the Cipher Bureau.

760
01:16:26,281 --> 01:16:29,860
They've cracked
the Soviet radiotelegraph code...

761
01:16:29,960 --> 01:16:33,955
and read Tukhachevsky's orders.
Get him in.

762
01:16:37,160 --> 01:16:41,580
Lieut Jan Kowalewski, sir.
Where's that order, son?

763
01:16:52,401 --> 01:16:56,641
You are aware of the significance
of this wire?

764
01:16:56,841 --> 01:16:59,476
That is why I'm here, Marshall.

765
01:17:01,801 --> 01:17:06,901
If this is confirmed,
you'll be awarded the Virtuti Militari.

766
01:17:07,641 --> 01:17:08,860
Yes, sir.

767
01:17:08,960 --> 01:17:10,960
And if this is a hoax,

768
01:17:12,520 --> 01:17:14,681
I will have you shot.

769
01:17:21,281 --> 01:17:22,221
Yes, sir.

770
01:17:22,321 --> 01:17:26,461
Gentlemen, being too weak
for any effective defense,

771
01:17:26,561 --> 01:17:28,761
we have to strike.

772
01:17:28,960 --> 01:17:33,221
Thanks to our radio intelligence
we are almost certain...

773
01:17:33,321 --> 01:17:36,976
of two things.
Budyonny's Cavalry Army...

774
01:17:37,160 --> 01:17:39,200
is waiting near Lviv,

775
01:17:39,321 --> 01:17:43,401
while Tukhachevsky
is redirecting his 4th Army...

776
01:17:43,440 --> 01:17:46,741
to the South-East
to strike on Sikorski's troops.

777
01:17:46,841 --> 01:17:50,701
If Budyonny makes a move,
he'll have to take Zamosc first,

778
01:17:50,801 --> 01:17:53,380
and the town will be fiercely defended...

779
01:17:53,480 --> 01:17:57,305
by the Ukrainians
led by General Bezruchko.

780
01:17:57,601 --> 01:18:01,301
This will create a gap in the Bolshevik front.

781
01:18:01,401 --> 01:18:04,941
Observe. Budyonny here,
the Mazyr Group here.

782
01:18:05,041 --> 01:18:09,060
We shall launch a counteroffensive
between those two armies.

783
01:18:09,160 --> 01:18:11,160
From the Wieprz River.

784
01:18:11,680 --> 01:18:14,081
I will take the command.

785
01:18:14,480 --> 01:18:19,181
General Rozwadowski shall provide
appropriate orders in writing.

786
01:18:19,281 --> 01:18:22,721
A splendid plan.
But we have no reserves.

787
01:18:22,920 --> 01:18:25,261
All units are engaged in combat.

788
01:18:25,361 --> 01:18:26,981
And that is why...

789
01:18:27,081 --> 01:18:31,561
we have to disengage
the best of our units...

790
01:18:31,920 --> 01:18:35,660
and strike from here,
where no one is expecting us.

791
01:18:35,760 --> 01:18:37,181
A great risk.

792
01:18:37,281 --> 01:18:41,956
What if our troops yield to pressure
and Warsaw falls...

793
01:18:42,121 --> 01:18:44,121
before you attack?

794
01:18:44,200 --> 01:18:49,100
You'll just have to stop the enemy
at the outskirts of the city,

795
01:18:49,200 --> 01:18:53,081
until my troops regroup at their rear.

796
01:18:54,081 --> 01:18:56,206
That's the only solution.

797
01:18:56,480 --> 01:19:00,761
If you fear Waterloo,
you'll never have Austerlitz.

798
01:19:00,960 --> 01:19:03,921
Just one last effort...

799
01:19:04,121 --> 01:19:06,241
and Warsaw is ours.

800
01:19:06,881 --> 01:19:08,501
Then Berlin.

801
01:19:08,601 --> 01:19:11,201
And then the rest of Europe.

802
01:19:11,680 --> 01:19:14,241
On to Warsaw.

803
01:19:20,041 --> 01:19:23,900
Death to the Polish landowners.
Death to Polish capitalists.

804
01:19:24,000 --> 01:19:27,461
Forward. Onward to victory.
Hurray, comrades.

805
01:19:27,561 --> 01:19:29,561
Hurray.

806
01:19:32,480 --> 01:19:34,480
To Warsaw.

807
01:19:44,361 --> 01:19:46,361
ON TO WARSAW.

808
01:20:33,641 --> 01:20:35,100
Stop.

809
01:20:35,200 --> 01:20:37,200
Or I'll shoot.

810
01:20:41,121 --> 01:20:43,121
Load.

811
01:20:44,401 --> 01:20:46,221
Fire.

812
01:20:46,321 --> 01:20:48,321
Load.

813
01:21:37,401 --> 01:21:39,401
I surrender.

814
01:23:10,361 --> 01:23:12,826
Dead. Take him away.
Next one.

815
01:23:29,760 --> 01:23:31,760
Nurse.

816
01:23:45,000 --> 01:23:47,000
Here.

817
01:23:48,081 --> 01:23:51,001
Dress the wound.
Throw that away.

818
01:23:56,321 --> 01:24:00,146
They say we're getting a thrashing
everywhere.

819
01:24:01,480 --> 01:24:06,835
There Bolsheviks are swarming,
it's impossible to kill them all.

820
01:24:11,801 --> 01:24:16,501
But they also say there'll be a miracle
on the Assumption Day.

821
01:24:16,601 --> 01:24:18,881
And the tables will turn.

822
01:24:19,081 --> 01:24:23,380
Stop babbling, Marynia.
They'll take you for a thickhead.

823
01:24:23,480 --> 01:24:25,775
But that's what people say.

824
01:24:31,520 --> 01:24:33,181
Soldiers.

825
01:24:33,281 --> 01:24:37,361
Who can carry a weapon,
get back to the trenches.

826
01:24:38,081 --> 01:24:40,081
To the trenches.

827
01:24:58,801 --> 01:25:00,801
How are things in town?

828
01:25:01,841 --> 01:25:04,986
The Diplomatic Corps has left Warsaw.

829
01:25:05,601 --> 01:25:07,601
And the Papal Nuncio?

830
01:25:08,240 --> 01:25:10,620
Monsignore Ratti has stayed.

831
01:25:12,200 --> 01:25:13,701
That's good.

832
01:25:13,801 --> 01:25:16,606
The Church knows what it's doing.

833
01:25:21,720 --> 01:25:25,460
We have to round up all the cavalry units...

834
01:25:25,960 --> 01:25:30,601
and put them under Rummel's command.

835
01:25:52,801 --> 01:25:54,801
On your feet.

836
01:25:55,760 --> 01:25:57,760
Attention.

837
01:26:03,960 --> 01:26:06,261
203rd Volunteer Cavalry Regiment.

838
01:26:06,361 --> 01:26:08,741
9th Riflemen Regiment.
At ease.

839
01:26:08,841 --> 01:26:10,340
Your losses?

840
01:26:10,440 --> 01:26:13,580
Half the men.
Will you manage two more days?

841
01:26:13,680 --> 01:26:14,741
Yes, sir.

842
01:26:14,841 --> 01:26:18,836
We will, provided we get
support and ammunition.

843
01:26:18,841 --> 01:26:22,326
I'm taking your lancers.
General, but...

844
01:26:23,440 --> 01:26:25,140
I have to.

845
01:26:25,240 --> 01:26:28,321
Ossów near Warsaw.

846
01:26:28,480 --> 01:26:30,775
Bolsheviks in the trenches.

847
01:26:30,960 --> 01:26:32,960
Form the lines.

848
01:26:35,920 --> 01:26:38,121
Fix... bayonets.

849
01:26:43,440 --> 01:26:46,201
I absolve you from your sins...

850
01:26:46,720 --> 01:26:52,160
the name of the Father, and of the Son,
and of the Holy Ghost.

851
01:27:39,960 --> 01:27:42,241
In small leaps... forward.

852
01:27:50,161 --> 01:27:52,881
They'll shoot us all like ducks.

853
01:27:53,881 --> 01:27:55,881
Holy Mary,

854
01:27:56,401 --> 01:27:59,376
Mother of God, pray for us sinners,

855
01:28:00,361 --> 01:28:03,166
now and at the hour of our death.

856
01:28:06,000 --> 01:28:10,841
Lord, you blessed Poland
for hundreds of years.

857
01:28:11,401 --> 01:28:16,001
Shedding your light of power upon her...

858
01:28:16,681 --> 01:28:18,681
Forward.

859
01:28:18,960 --> 01:28:20,960
Forward.

860
01:28:33,040 --> 01:28:35,040
Charge.

861
01:28:49,520 --> 01:28:54,481
Here at Thy altar.

862
01:28:55,321 --> 01:29:00,001
We beg and implore Thee.

863
01:29:02,040 --> 01:29:07,401
Give us back freedom.

864
01:29:08,241 --> 01:29:13,361
Give us back our country.

865
01:29:25,640 --> 01:29:29,641
RED ARMY HEADQUARTERS...

866
01:29:34,000 --> 01:29:36,081
Comrade.
Later.

867
01:29:38,161 --> 01:29:41,561
This was found on a dead Polish officer.

868
01:29:44,881 --> 01:29:47,921
Pitsudski's order.
Yes, comrade.

869
01:29:49,560 --> 01:29:52,601
Counteroffensive.
Yes, sir.

870
01:29:54,080 --> 01:29:56,281
Dismissed.
Yes, sir.

871
01:30:00,681 --> 01:30:02,681
That's not possible.

872
01:30:11,161 --> 01:30:13,161
It's a set-up.

873
01:30:14,681 --> 01:30:18,081
They want to lure us away from Warsaw...

874
01:30:18,440 --> 01:30:22,095
if I were him,
I wouldn't take that risk.

875
01:30:23,161 --> 01:30:25,161
However...

876
01:30:30,640 --> 01:30:33,481
they could force a wedge here.

877
01:30:33,920 --> 01:30:35,920
That's their plan.

878
01:30:40,120 --> 01:30:45,135
Get me the 4th Cavalry Army.
Send corrections to the orders.

879
01:30:50,040 --> 01:30:52,040
Don't use the code.

880
01:30:52,480 --> 01:30:55,141
Let's make sure they're reading us.

881
01:30:55,241 --> 01:30:57,241
No reaction, comrade.

882
01:30:57,640 --> 01:30:59,841
Is the other machine on?

883
01:31:00,361 --> 01:31:02,641
The Poles are jamming us.

884
01:31:03,681 --> 01:31:08,241
They're on our frequency
and they keep sending this...

885
01:31:09,080 --> 01:31:11,079
What is it?

886
01:31:11,080 --> 01:31:13,080
Read it.

887
01:31:13,600 --> 01:31:15,600
The Holy Scriptures.

888
01:31:15,960 --> 01:31:16,940
What?

889
01:31:17,040 --> 01:31:19,201
The Holy Scriptures.

890
01:31:20,161 --> 01:31:22,801
The bastards... Jesuits.

891
01:31:23,000 --> 01:31:27,340
'God called the light Day,
and the darkness he called Night.

892
01:31:27,440 --> 01:31:30,961
And the evening and the morning...

893
01:31:31,161 --> 01:31:33,681
were the first day.

894
01:31:33,881 --> 01:31:37,301
And then God said,
Let there be a firmament...

895
01:31:37,401 --> 01:31:41,061
in the midst of the waters
to separate the waters.'.

896
01:31:41,161 --> 01:31:44,121
You're jamming them?
Yes, sir.

897
01:31:44,321 --> 01:31:47,211
What's that text?
The Holy Bible.

898
01:31:47,321 --> 01:31:49,441
Perhaps they'll convert.

899
01:32:19,520 --> 01:32:21,520
We must succeed.

900
01:32:22,440 --> 01:32:25,621
In wartime,
it's all in the hands of God.

901
01:32:25,721 --> 01:32:31,001
Warsaw is a city where
the streets are lined with chocolate.

902
01:32:32,321 --> 01:32:36,601
Expensive shops, gold, furs,

903
01:32:36,801 --> 01:32:40,681
bourgeois apartments,
they will all be yours.

904
01:32:40,881 --> 01:32:42,881
Let's take Warsaw.

905
01:33:09,440 --> 01:33:11,440
Marynia, come.

906
01:33:21,321 --> 01:33:23,321
Bandage, Marynia.

907
01:33:36,040 --> 01:33:38,961
Aurelia... Aurelia wait.

908
01:33:39,161 --> 01:33:41,161
Oh Jesus.

909
01:33:41,480 --> 01:33:42,860
Jesus.

910
01:33:42,960 --> 01:33:44,960
Save Marynia.

911
01:33:45,560 --> 01:33:47,770
Save her...
Stay with me.

912
01:33:47,960 --> 01:33:49,960
Do you hear?

913
01:34:30,161 --> 01:34:32,161
Loader.

914
01:34:40,080 --> 01:34:42,241
Where is the loader?

915
01:34:42,440 --> 01:34:44,440
Here I am.

916
01:35:26,681 --> 01:35:30,380
We're under attack.
We're greatly outnumbered.

917
01:35:30,480 --> 01:35:32,480
Sarge.

918
01:35:32,520 --> 01:35:35,241
To arms. Everyone to arms.

919
01:35:36,681 --> 01:35:38,681
Sarge.

920
01:35:47,960 --> 01:35:50,401
Medic. Medic.

921
01:35:52,960 --> 01:35:55,081
Stretcher.
Help.

922
01:37:05,681 --> 01:37:09,161
We've got no chances...
Retreat.

923
01:41:12,080 --> 01:41:15,601
Pitsudski and his Poles...

924
01:41:16,080 --> 01:41:19,650
have dealt a major blow to the cause...

925
01:41:19,801 --> 01:41:21,420
of global revolution.

926
01:41:21,520 --> 01:41:25,515
We'll have to build a socialist state
elsewhere.

927
01:41:44,560 --> 01:41:46,961
Excellent victory, Marshall.

928
01:41:48,560 --> 01:41:51,820
Our compatriots will attribute it
to someone else.

929
01:41:51,920 --> 01:41:55,101
Our compatriots will call it a miracle.

930
01:41:55,201 --> 01:41:56,420
A miracle?

931
01:41:56,520 --> 01:42:00,430
I'm sure they will.
The miracle at the Vistula.

932
01:42:01,161 --> 01:42:03,401
You know, Wieniawa,

933
01:42:03,520 --> 01:42:05,881
you might just be right.

934
01:43:47,761 --> 01:43:49,761
You're back...

935
01:43:53,000 --> 01:43:55,000
I promised...

936
01:43:56,201 --> 01:43:58,201
so I'm back.
