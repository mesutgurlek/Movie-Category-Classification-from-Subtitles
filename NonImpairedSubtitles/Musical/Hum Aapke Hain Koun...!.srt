1
00:00:31,063 --> 00:00:39,446
Who am I to you?

2
00:00:40,572 --> 00:00:47,829
Who am I to you?

3
00:01:03,512 --> 00:01:10,727
My eyes are restless!

4
00:01:11,770 --> 00:01:19,069
T'is the effect of love!

5
00:01:20,237 --> 00:01:27,452
Can't be mum, all I can say is that..

6
00:01:28,578 --> 00:01:36,837
..who am I to you?

7
00:01:37,004 --> 00:01:45,178
Who am I to you?

8
00:01:53,603 --> 00:02:00,819
I had to restrain myself, my love.

9
00:02:01,987 --> 00:02:09,202
Ultimately, I had to say it.

10
00:02:10,287 --> 00:02:17,544
In my dreams.. why do you come?

11
00:02:18,670 --> 00:02:25,886
Who am I to you?

12
00:02:26,136 --> 00:02:34,227
Who am I to you?

13
00:02:42,694 --> 00:02:50,952
My eyes are restless!

14
00:02:51,203 --> 00:02:59,294
T'is the effect of love.

15
00:02:59,461 --> 00:03:06,593
I'm sort of lost..
please don't ask me..

16
00:03:07,636 --> 00:03:14,935
..who am I to you?

17
00:03:15,978 --> 00:03:23,276
Who am I to you?

18
00:03:32,786 --> 00:03:40,002
How should I tell you
the feelings in my heart?

19
00:03:40,168 --> 00:03:48,343
Try to read my face sometimes.

20
00:03:48,510 --> 00:03:55,642
You may call it my shyness!

21
00:03:56,768 --> 00:04:03,984
Who am I to you?

22
00:04:05,152 --> 00:04:12,367
Who am I to you?

23
00:04:13,493 --> 00:04:20,709
Who am I to you?

24
00:04:33,221 --> 00:04:36,350
We welcome all
the spectators to ' Prem Nivas'.

25
00:04:41,563 --> 00:04:45,734
Greetings to one and
all from Laloo Prasad.

26
00:04:46,860 --> 00:04:49,905
The match is about to begin
in a short while from now.

27
00:04:50,197 --> 00:04:52,032
I will be giving
the live commentary.

28
00:04:52,199 --> 00:04:55,160
The sky is absolutely clear..
there are a few clouds.

29
00:04:56,286 --> 00:05:00,332
The umpire has inspected the pitch
and is about to take his place.

30
00:05:07,673 --> 00:05:09,758
The batsman is ready.
Fielders, be on the alert.

31
00:05:10,008 --> 00:05:14,972
Presenting to you, one who bowls
at a speed faster than the wind!

32
00:05:25,482 --> 00:05:27,484
I will hit him for a 6 off
the first ball itself.

33
00:05:31,780 --> 00:05:33,782
Should I hit him for a 4 or a 6?

34
00:05:41,415 --> 00:05:43,500
Hey Laloo, you are always out
to the first ball!

35
00:05:45,669 --> 00:05:50,799
I just gave the bowler a chance.
It's your turn to bat.

36
00:05:50,966 --> 00:05:52,884
No, it's my turn. I will play too.

37
00:05:53,093 --> 00:05:56,013
You must be aware as to what
happened when Rita last came to bat.

38
00:05:56,305 --> 00:05:58,098
She broke her legs.

39
00:06:00,309 --> 00:06:02,311
Prem will coach me this time.
Won't you, Prem?

40
00:06:03,353 --> 00:06:07,524
Will I coach you?
Go and field on the boundary line.

41
00:06:07,774 --> 00:06:09,609
You always ask me to field.

42
00:06:09,860 --> 00:06:11,695
It's similar to what you've been
doing to hook Prem for all these years.

43
00:06:11,945 --> 00:06:13,780
You will field while Prem will bat.

44
00:06:13,947 --> 00:06:15,866
You will go and bowl.

45
00:06:16,116 --> 00:06:17,951
Kapil Dev, come to my rescue!

46
00:06:18,201 --> 00:06:20,037
Protect yourself from my attack,
Prem.

47
00:06:20,287 --> 00:06:22,122
Here comes Laloo with his googly.

48
00:06:25,250 --> 00:06:27,336
Rita, catch the ball.

49
00:06:34,718 --> 00:06:37,763
I' m dead. I'm dead.
- Don't utter inauspicious things.

50
00:06:37,971 --> 00:06:39,848
My back is broken.

51
00:06:40,057 --> 00:06:43,018
I'm sorry. - You fool,
what are you doing here?

52
00:06:44,061 --> 00:06:46,146
Auntie, she had come here to
Iearn to play cricket.

53
00:06:47,189 --> 00:06:50,317
This game of cricket is
becoming a nuisance.

54
00:06:51,443 --> 00:06:53,445
Kids will always play! - Quiet.

55
00:06:54,571 --> 00:06:56,573
Greetings auntie.

56
00:06:56,740 --> 00:06:59,701
How many times have I told you
not to call me auntie?

57
00:07:02,829 --> 00:07:07,000
Not only humans but dogs too
are pampered here in this house.

58
00:07:07,167 --> 00:07:09,086
What are you staring at me?
Come with me.

59
00:07:09,252 --> 00:07:13,256
I'm dead! - Uncle
why is auntie in such a 'haste?

60
00:07:14,299 --> 00:07:19,513
She's come to talk to your
uncle about Rajesh's wedding.

61
00:07:19,805 --> 00:07:24,768
Honestly speaking, Rajesh is worth
every good word spoken about him!

62
00:07:25,894 --> 00:07:27,896
Not only me but everybody is
of the same opinion.

63
00:07:28,146 --> 00:07:32,067
It's not a joke to manage this
big business at this young age!

64
00:07:32,317 --> 00:07:34,152
What do you say? - Perfect.

65
00:07:34,319 --> 00:07:36,238
You have to think
about his wedding now.

66
00:07:36,488 --> 00:07:38,323
Tell me if you know
of some good girl.

67
00:07:39,449 --> 00:07:41,451
I have seen the girl. - Is that so?

68
00:07:41,702 --> 00:07:45,622
You have met my brother from Delhi,
Rita's dad, haven't you? - Yes.

69
00:07:45,872 --> 00:07:48,750
I was referring to his elder daughter,
that's Rita's elder sister, Sweetie.

70
00:07:48,917 --> 00:07:52,921
Sweetie has always been with him
in Delhi and Rita's been with me.

71
00:07:53,171 --> 00:07:56,049
Sweetie is a very beautiful,
understanding and decent girl!

72
00:07:56,341 --> 00:07:58,135
Isn't that so? - Yes.
She's failed in B.A.

73
00:07:59,177 --> 00:08:01,263
She thinks in terms of
the present generation.

74
00:08:01,555 --> 00:08:04,391
She's already had a couple of
broken engagements. Isn't that so?

75
00:08:04,683 --> 00:08:08,603
So what? Think about the big family.
Their business is worth millions.

76
00:08:08,854 --> 00:08:10,689
The wedding will be a pompous one.

77
00:08:10,939 --> 00:08:12,774
She'll bring along something
worthwhile as dowry too.

78
00:08:12,941 --> 00:08:15,902
But you won't understand
these norms of life!

79
00:08:16,069 --> 00:08:17,988
After all, you are a professor
at the college.

80
00:08:18,155 --> 00:08:21,116
If you agree, I will inform
my brother accordingly.

81
00:08:22,159 --> 00:08:25,287
Rita, it's time for our
kitty party. Let's go.

82
00:08:25,454 --> 00:08:29,458
We're leaving. - Thanks.
- What did you say? - Nothing.

83
00:08:30,584 --> 00:08:32,586
I'll leave, brother. - So long then.

84
00:08:32,836 --> 00:08:34,671
Come on. You're quite a hog.

85
00:08:35,797 --> 00:08:39,885
Wealth is all that she thinks of!

86
00:08:40,093 --> 00:08:41,970
We don't want her
rich brother's daughter.

87
00:08:43,096 --> 00:08:46,141
What we want is a down-to-earth
and a lovely daughter-in-law!

88
00:08:46,433 --> 00:08:49,311
One who will bless this house
with her love and care!

89
00:08:50,437 --> 00:08:53,482
You have brought up this house
with so much love!

90
00:08:54,524 --> 00:08:57,653
Rajesh and Prem were so small
when sister and her husband died.

91
00:08:57,819 --> 00:09:01,782
You abandoned your studies too
to look after these children.

92
00:09:02,074 --> 00:09:03,909
You started off with a small job.

93
00:09:05,035 --> 00:09:08,121
For their future, you only thought
of hard work as your goal.

94
00:09:08,246 --> 00:09:10,165
You didn't marry too!

95
00:09:10,332 --> 00:09:13,251
You've brought up these children
with such good values!

96
00:09:13,543 --> 00:09:15,379
That's the reason
for Rajesh's success.

97
00:09:15,629 --> 00:09:17,464
Prem too has stood first at
the MBA exams this year.

98
00:09:18,548 --> 00:09:20,592
Brother, I have seen
a girl for Rajesh.

99
00:09:21,635 --> 00:09:23,720
Sometimes back, I had gone to
Poona for a conference.

100
00:09:23,929 --> 00:09:26,848
I met Professor S. S. Chowdhury
over there.

101
00:09:27,891 --> 00:09:30,018
Would that be Prof. Siddharth
Chowdhury? - Do you know him?

102
00:09:30,227 --> 00:09:32,104
We've studied at the same college.
We were very good friends.

103
00:09:34,231 --> 00:09:36,274
I met his elder daughter
over there.

104
00:09:36,525 --> 00:09:39,403
Just saw her for once, and she's
made a home for herself in my heart!

105
00:09:40,445 --> 00:09:42,489
I liked her so much that
I brought her photograph too.

106
00:09:43,657 --> 00:09:47,744
Her name is Pooja. She's passed
B.A. Very sweet in nature!

107
00:09:47,995 --> 00:09:50,872
They'll make a good pair.
- I agree.

108
00:09:51,039 --> 00:09:53,959
Professor has gone on a pilgrimage
with his family to Ramtekdi.

109
00:09:54,251 --> 00:09:57,129
As soon as he returns, we'll pay him
a visit. It's just a trip of 3-4 hours.

110
00:09:57,379 --> 00:10:00,299
All that's required is for them to like
each other. - That's the main problem.

111
00:10:01,383 --> 00:10:03,427
Whenever I talk about marriage
to Rajesh, he ignores it.

112
00:10:03,635 --> 00:10:05,470
How can we make the two of them meet?

113
00:10:05,762 --> 00:10:07,556
There is a way. Why don't we
go to Ramtekdi too?

114
00:10:07,848 --> 00:10:09,641
It would be a combination of
a holiday and a pilgrimage.

115
00:10:09,933 --> 00:10:11,768
And also the selection
of sister-in-law.

116
00:10:12,894 --> 00:10:14,938
But brother shouldn't be aware of
this plan. Everyone should be alert.

117
00:10:20,193 --> 00:10:23,238
Big brother is here.
Come on, uncle.

118
00:10:25,324 --> 00:10:28,452
So you're back, Rajesh. You're
meeting took a long time today!

119
00:10:28,702 --> 00:10:30,537
What did the foreign collaborators say?

120
00:10:30,746 --> 00:10:33,665
We had a detailed discussion.
They'll study our report now.

121
00:10:33,874 --> 00:10:36,793
Uncle, if everything works
out properly..

122
00:10:36,960 --> 00:10:40,964
..like you said, this factory will be
the first of it's kind in this country!

123
00:10:41,173 --> 00:10:46,178
Prem, your brother is setting up
such a big factory to launch you.

124
00:10:46,470 --> 00:10:48,263
Big brother, the food is ready.

125
00:10:49,431 --> 00:10:53,518
Hey, there's a feast out here!
Is it some special occasion?

126
00:10:53,769 --> 00:10:58,732
Actually, big brother.. - Well,
we all are very happy today. - Happy?

127
00:10:58,899 --> 00:11:01,860
Well, big brother, we have decided
to go to Ramtekdi for our holidays.

128
00:11:02,110 --> 00:11:06,031
Ramtekdi? But uncle, you were
insisting on going to a hill station.

129
00:11:07,157 --> 00:11:12,287
Ramtekdi is a very holy place.
My uncle and aunt go there every year.

130
00:11:12,454 --> 00:11:14,373
They make vows too!
- The program is fixed.

131
00:11:15,499 --> 00:11:18,585
This time we'll take that new
dress of yours too.

132
00:11:18,710 --> 00:11:20,629
Why is it needed over there?
- Why not?..

133
00:11:22,798 --> 00:11:26,843
What did he say uncle?
- I didn't hear.

134
00:11:27,177 --> 00:11:30,013
We don't interfere in such matters.
Chameli, let's get some food.

135
00:11:38,397 --> 00:11:41,525
That's amazing.
Nobody is telling me anything.

136
00:11:42,651 --> 00:11:46,738
What should we tell you brother..
as to what we will get at Ramtekdi.

137
00:12:27,446 --> 00:12:29,531
Be quick dad.

138
00:12:29,781 --> 00:12:33,702
Mom will be mad if she catches you
at this experiment in the kitchen

139
00:12:33,952 --> 00:12:36,830
Let her be angry.
I'm not afraid of her.

140
00:12:37,080 --> 00:12:41,001
If she notices these sweets
she'll be tempted to break her f!ast.

141
00:12:41,251 --> 00:12:44,129
Are you listening? - What is it?
- It's not me but mom.

142
00:13:10,322 --> 00:13:15,452
Who broke the jar? - What?
- Who broke the jar?

143
00:13:15,619 --> 00:13:19,623
Pooja, when Lord Ram
broke Lord Shiv's bow..

144
00:13:19,873 --> 00:13:22,751
..Lord Shiv very angrily asked as
to who had broken the bow.

145
00:13:23,794 --> 00:13:26,922
Lord Ram, with all simplicity
and love replied..

146
00:13:32,219 --> 00:13:36,306
Have some shame. We've got two grown
up girls. What will they think?

147
00:13:36,515 --> 00:13:39,476
What will they think? Did I say
something wrong, my love?

148
00:13:39,643 --> 00:13:41,561
I didn't say anything wrong.
I was just..

149
00:13:41,728 --> 00:13:43,647
It's difficult for both of us
to win against you.

150
00:13:43,814 --> 00:13:45,732
If anyone can win against you,
it will be.. Nisha.

151
00:13:55,200 --> 00:13:57,202
Good morning, manager uncle.

152
00:14:05,544 --> 00:14:09,715
Devil! You always come
like an express train!

153
00:14:09,965 --> 00:14:13,885
Papa has sent the books from
the library and has said thanks.

154
00:14:17,097 --> 00:14:24,354
Brother, your bill? - Here's your
bill. You remove the books.

155
00:14:26,440 --> 00:14:28,525
Nisha child, will you do
me a small favor?

156
00:14:28,775 --> 00:14:32,696
Will you add this up by the time
we come back from the storeroom?

157
00:14:33,822 --> 00:14:36,867
Don't indulge in any mischief.

158
00:14:40,078 --> 00:14:42,080
Come on now. What are you staring?

159
00:15:14,529 --> 00:15:16,531
Is this Ram Narayan guesthouse?

160
00:15:17,658 --> 00:15:22,788
Didn't you read the board outside?..
where was I?

161
00:15:38,428 --> 00:15:43,642
What is it? - Can you tell me
which room Prof. Chowdhury is in?

162
00:15:44,685 --> 00:15:47,854
Why? - Well.. I had some work.

163
00:15:50,023 --> 00:15:54,111
I understood. - What? - Stand up.

164
00:15:54,361 --> 00:15:58,281
Stand up. You people don't study
all the year round.

165
00:15:59,324 --> 00:16:03,495
Don't study at all and then
panic at the time of exams.

166
00:16:03,662 --> 00:16:05,580
You've come here to
enhance your marks.

167
00:16:05,831 --> 00:16:07,666
You better change
the number of your glasses.

168
00:16:07,916 --> 00:16:10,794
Wonder what you think of yourself
after sitting on the manager's chair?

169
00:16:11,044 --> 00:16:12,879
Well.. - Nisha. - Oh God!

170
00:16:26,560 --> 00:16:28,562
I' m over here, sister.

171
00:16:33,775 --> 00:16:38,989
You're sitting here! Mom is
waiting for you out there.

172
00:16:39,156 --> 00:16:42,117
What were you doing? - Well,
I was.. I was..

173
00:16:46,371 --> 00:16:49,416
Welcome. - Uncle, you proceed
while I keep the baggage.

174
00:16:53,670 --> 00:16:55,672
You were asking for
Prof. Chowdhury, right?

175
00:16:55,839 --> 00:16:57,758
These are his daughters,
Pooja and Nisha.

176
00:16:58,008 --> 00:17:01,928
Pooja child, he is Mr. Kailashnath.
He's your dad's pal.

177
00:17:02,137 --> 00:17:05,057
Greetings. - Greetings.

178
00:17:05,265 --> 00:17:07,142
He wants to meet the professor.
- Please come.

179
00:17:14,566 --> 00:17:16,568
Take this. I've calculated it.

180
00:17:16,818 --> 00:17:19,696
You've calculated it. That's great.
Here's your reward.

181
00:17:23,950 --> 00:17:26,995
Manager, you please recalculate.

182
00:17:27,245 --> 00:17:30,123
People say that beautiful girls
are always wrong at calculating.

183
00:17:31,249 --> 00:17:34,294
What did you say? - Do you
eat chocolates, Miss Nisha.

184
00:17:34,461 --> 00:17:36,380
Don't mention my name.

185
00:17:41,677 --> 00:17:44,721
These sweets taste great, professor.

186
00:17:45,013 --> 00:17:48,892
Have it with this 'chutney' and you
will forget the famous 'Mathura sweets'.

187
00:18:01,530 --> 00:18:04,574
My younger nephew, Prem.
- May you live long, child.

188
00:18:04,825 --> 00:18:06,660
Your uncle has lost a bet.
- Which one?

189
00:18:07,786 --> 00:18:09,788
He had said that only I would go
bald but he has lost his hair too.

190
00:18:11,957 --> 00:18:13,959
Have a look at who has come over.

191
00:18:17,129 --> 00:18:20,215
Greetings. Did you recognize?
- How are you?

192
00:18:20,382 --> 00:18:23,343
He has to be fine. After all he's
one of the top industrialists!

193
00:18:24,469 --> 00:18:26,513
Come and have a seat.

194
00:18:26,680 --> 00:18:29,599
Truly, whenever I read about you in
the papers, I feel very proud!

195
00:18:32,144 --> 00:18:35,230
Prem, you may not be aware about
the history of the three of us.

196
00:18:35,355 --> 00:18:38,317
We were in college together and
we had a lot of fun.

197
00:18:39,401 --> 00:18:41,445
Keep it here.

198
00:18:42,487 --> 00:18:44,573
You've already met my daughters,
right? - Yes.

199
00:18:45,615 --> 00:18:48,744
Do you come here every year?

200
00:18:50,829 --> 00:18:52,914
I've come this year with
a very special mission.

201
00:18:53,165 --> 00:18:57,085
I'd like my nephew Rajesh to get
married to your elder daughter.

202
00:19:00,339 --> 00:19:02,341
That's if you don't
have any objections.

203
00:19:03,383 --> 00:19:06,470
Objection? What are you talking?
After all, he's your nephew!

204
00:19:07,638 --> 00:19:11,725
Rajesh has come with us. You meet him.
Go and call brother.

205
00:19:12,851 --> 00:19:14,853
Go right ahead.

206
00:19:20,150 --> 00:19:24,237
Thanks. - Professor
I should be thanking y'ou.

207
00:19:25,364 --> 00:19:28,408
God has given me everything!
The love of these children..

208
00:19:29,534 --> 00:19:32,579
..a big business empire..
but the house seems barren!

209
00:19:33,622 --> 00:19:35,666
Rajesh has had his share
of motherly love..

210
00:19:36,750 --> 00:19:39,878
..but Prem has been deprived
of that love.

211
00:19:48,345 --> 00:19:50,389
Come on brother. Come in Rajesh.

212
00:19:51,473 --> 00:19:53,517
The Professor.. and his wife.

213
00:19:53,725 --> 00:19:55,560
Have a seat, child.

214
00:20:11,284 --> 00:20:14,329
Apart from your work,
what are your other hobbies?

215
00:20:15,455 --> 00:20:18,500
Brother paints very well.
Isn't that right, brother?

216
00:20:18,792 --> 00:20:20,585
Is that so? - Just a little bit.

217
00:20:20,877 --> 00:20:23,714
Pooja paints well too,
isn't that so?

218
00:20:28,010 --> 00:20:32,097
Yes dad. - Show Rajesh that painting
of the temple that you're doing.

219
00:20:33,181 --> 00:20:36,310
Brother, let's go and see the
painting. We'll just be back, uncle.

220
00:20:36,518 --> 00:20:38,353
Come on brother, let's have
a look at the painting.

221
00:20:44,609 --> 00:20:46,695
Where are you going?
- How does it concern you?

222
00:20:47,738 --> 00:20:51,908
You let them talk.
You can talk to me.

223
00:20:52,159 --> 00:20:57,122
What should I talk to you? - Why?
Are you still angry with me?

224
00:20:59,207 --> 00:21:01,293
Don't mention my name.

225
00:21:09,432 --> 00:21:11,475
It's a very nice painting!

226
00:21:15,688 --> 00:21:17,690
You paint too. Don't you?

227
00:21:19,775 --> 00:21:23,946
I do paint but..
not something so beautiful!

228
00:21:38,627 --> 00:21:40,671
Give it to me.

229
00:21:45,926 --> 00:21:47,928
Brother, did you like the painting?

230
00:21:49,096 --> 00:21:51,098
I've been noticing since afternoon.

231
00:21:51,348 --> 00:21:53,184
You've been asking me the same
question every 15 minutes.

232
00:21:54,268 --> 00:21:56,312
What's the matter?

233
00:21:56,479 --> 00:21:58,397
Well, I will go and get
you some nice tea.

234
00:21:59,440 --> 00:22:01,525
Wait.

235
00:22:03,694 --> 00:22:05,696
Tell me, what is the truth.

236
00:22:05,946 --> 00:22:07,782
Promise me that you won't scold me
nor will you beat me.

237
00:22:07,990 --> 00:22:11,911
It's a promise. - Did you
like the painting? - Yes.

238
00:22:12,119 --> 00:22:16,123
Did you like the colors of
the painting? - Yes.

239
00:22:17,166 --> 00:22:19,251
Did you like the one
who did the painting?

240
00:22:22,463 --> 00:22:26,550
That's great. We had brought you
here to hear this. Congrats.

241
00:22:27,718 --> 00:22:29,720
Uncle. - You wait.

242
00:22:29,970 --> 00:22:31,806
Uncle, brother's life is made.

243
00:22:32,932 --> 00:22:34,934
Greetings, priest.

244
00:22:35,976 --> 00:22:38,020
Bhabhi, save me.

245
00:22:58,999 --> 00:23:04,130
You're great Lord..
what a pair you have created!

246
00:23:06,257 --> 00:23:10,344
Congratulations to my
brother and bhabhi!

247
00:23:12,555 --> 00:23:15,683
More than any other
ritual in this world..

248
00:23:15,891 --> 00:23:18,811
..the relation of hearts
is the most important!

249
00:23:19,895 --> 00:23:25,025
Thanks to you, this event has
seen the light of the day.

250
00:23:26,068 --> 00:23:31,282
Congratulations to my sister
and brother-in-law!

251
00:23:33,451 --> 00:23:36,495
More than any other ritual
in this world..

252
00:23:36,745 --> 00:23:39,623
..the relation of hearts is
the most important!

253
00:23:39,874 --> 00:23:44,837
You're great Lord!..
You're great Lord!

254
00:23:46,922 --> 00:23:50,050
You're great Lord!

255
00:24:13,115 --> 00:24:19,288
My brother,
who is sitting so quietly.

256
00:24:20,414 --> 00:24:25,544
Bhabhi, have a look at
his stubborn posture.

257
00:24:27,630 --> 00:24:29,715
But, he is a very good guy.

258
00:24:30,758 --> 00:24:33,886
He is a very good guy
but a bit naughty.

259
00:24:34,095 --> 00:24:37,014
You're the only one that
he has fallen for!

260
00:24:38,182 --> 00:24:42,269
My sister is acting tough now!

261
00:24:44,355 --> 00:24:49,568
Congratulations to my
brother and bhabhi!

262
00:24:50,694 --> 00:24:53,739
More than any other ritual
in this world..

263
00:24:53,989 --> 00:24:56,867
..the relation of hearts
is the most important!

264
00:24:57,993 --> 00:25:03,124
You're great, Lord!
You're great, Lord!

265
00:25:04,250 --> 00:25:07,294
You're great, Lord!

266
00:25:31,402 --> 00:25:37,575
Brother-in-law, for your sake..

267
00:25:38,701 --> 00:25:43,831
..my sister has prayed a lot!

268
00:25:44,957 --> 00:25:50,087
She's been to the temples..
she's been to the temples..

269
00:25:50,337 --> 00:25:52,173
..prayed day and night!

270
00:25:52,339 --> 00:25:55,301
She's been invoking
Almighty all the time.

271
00:25:55,593 --> 00:26:00,514
I've got a bhabhi as
I had desired!

272
00:26:02,725 --> 00:26:07,855
Congratulations to my sister
and brother-in-law!

273
00:26:08,981 --> 00:26:12,026
More than any other
ritual in this world..

274
00:26:12,276 --> 00:26:15,154
..the relation of hearts
is the most important!

275
00:26:16,197 --> 00:26:22,453
You're great, Lord!
You're great, Lord!

276
00:26:23,579 --> 00:26:26,624
You're great, Lord!

277
00:26:53,159 --> 00:26:56,204
That's a nice garland
you've brought, Tuffy.

278
00:26:56,454 --> 00:26:59,332
Tuffy too knows that this evening,
folks from brother's in-law's place..

279
00:26:59,582 --> 00:27:01,418
..are coming with
the ritual offerings.

280
00:27:01,668 --> 00:27:05,588
There shouldn't be anything amiss
in welcoming them. Right, Tuffy?

281
00:27:06,714 --> 00:27:10,802
Big brother, is she coming too?
- I'll just be back, uncle.

282
00:27:11,645 --> 00:27:14,773
What happened?
- You' re always the fool!

283
00:27:15,065 --> 00:27:17,901
Uncle, does the girl come
over before wedding?

284
00:27:18,944 --> 00:27:21,029
How do I know?
We aren't married as yet.

285
00:27:26,368 --> 00:27:31,498
You are needed desperately
down here in the hall.

286
00:27:31,665 --> 00:27:33,583
The doctor has come too.

287
00:27:34,709 --> 00:27:36,711
Let him come.
I'll take care of him.

288
00:27:37,837 --> 00:27:39,839
Greetings, doctor. - Greetings.

289
00:27:40,006 --> 00:27:41,925
What's the matter?
Why are you so angry?

290
00:27:42,175 --> 00:27:44,010
Are you asking me?

291
00:27:45,136 --> 00:27:47,138
You ask him that question.

292
00:27:48,181 --> 00:27:50,267
He confirmed Rajesh's marriage,
chose the daughter-in-law.

293
00:27:50,433 --> 00:27:52,352
I get the news today.

294
00:27:53,478 --> 00:27:55,480
What is it?.. I don't want it.

295
00:27:56,606 --> 00:27:59,651
I'm very angry today.
I won't eat nor drink today.

296
00:27:59,943 --> 00:28:01,736
I'm leaving. Congratulations.
Goodbye. Move aside.

297
00:28:03,822 --> 00:28:06,992
The photo of my daughter-in-law
is on the table.

298
00:28:13,331 --> 00:28:15,333
How did you like daughter-in-law?

299
00:28:16,459 --> 00:28:19,504
Her simplicity reminds me of a poem.

300
00:28:20,630 --> 00:28:22,632
Sit down. Doctor will recite a poem.

301
00:28:23,758 --> 00:28:25,760
It goes something like this..
- Wow, wow..

302
00:28:25,927 --> 00:28:27,846
Let me start the poem.

303
00:28:28,889 --> 00:28:32,017
I've turned into a photo
after looking at the photo..

304
00:28:33,059 --> 00:28:35,145
I've turned into a photo after
Iooking at the photo..

305
00:28:36,187 --> 00:28:38,273
..I'm so jealous of
my friend's good fortune.

306
00:28:40,442 --> 00:28:44,529
Have a look. He told me that
he is very angry.

307
00:28:44,821 --> 00:28:46,615
Told me not to talk to anyone.

308
00:28:47,782 --> 00:28:49,784
One look at daughter-in-law's
photo and your anger vanished!

309
00:28:50,827 --> 00:28:52,913
Welcome, bhabhi.

310
00:28:54,039 --> 00:28:57,083
I can understand that you
are a heart specialist..

311
00:28:57,334 --> 00:28:59,169
..and bhabhi is a child specialist.

312
00:28:59,336 --> 00:29:03,340
What I can't understand is this
combination of a doctor and a poet.

313
00:29:03,506 --> 00:29:07,510
That's something he has taken
to very seriously.

314
00:29:07,761 --> 00:29:09,596
Uncle, why do you indulge in poetry?

315
00:29:09,763 --> 00:29:12,724
Poetry in its truest form is
always in front of you!

316
00:29:13,850 --> 00:29:15,852
What did you say? What did you say?

317
00:29:16,978 --> 00:29:24,194
Did you hear that? This younger
one talks a lot these days.

318
00:29:25,237 --> 00:29:29,449
Shall we get you too married
along with your brother?

319
00:29:29,616 --> 00:29:32,577
Auntie, why delay something good?
- Shameless.

320
00:29:36,831 --> 00:29:38,833
I heard doctor auntie's talks.

321
00:29:39,876 --> 00:29:41,962
It's your turn to search for a bride.

322
00:29:43,004 --> 00:29:46,132
I' m just coming.
Somebody is calling me.

323
00:29:46,383 --> 00:29:49,261
Whenever I want to talk to you,
somebody always calls for you.

324
00:29:50,387 --> 00:29:52,389
But I know very well how to
win over your heart.

325
00:29:52,556 --> 00:29:55,517
The formula to make sweets
in half an hour.

326
00:29:55,767 --> 00:29:58,645
First of all, the utensil..
where's it?

327
00:30:03,859 --> 00:30:05,944
Stupid, I'm hurt.

328
00:30:06,152 --> 00:30:08,029
How could I know that you
were standing here?

329
00:30:08,321 --> 00:30:10,115
Ouiet. Give me the utensil.

330
00:30:11,199 --> 00:30:13,285
By the way, baby,
what are you doing here?

331
00:30:13,451 --> 00:30:18,498
I'm making sweets.
- So you're making sweets for Prem!

332
00:30:18,748 --> 00:30:20,584
Are you making it as per this book?

333
00:30:21,710 --> 00:30:24,754
Just answer whatever I ask of you.

334
00:30:25,881 --> 00:30:27,883
Where's the 'Suji'?
- It's over there.

335
00:30:28,133 --> 00:30:29,968
'Ghee'? - Right next to it.

336
00:30:31,011 --> 00:30:33,096
Sugar? - In that jar.

337
00:30:34,222 --> 00:30:36,224
Baby, you are..

338
00:30:38,393 --> 00:30:42,480
What happened? - She brought
salt instead of sugar.

339
00:30:48,820 --> 00:30:51,907
Why don't you tell her? - Let it
be. She called me stupid.

340
00:30:52,157 --> 00:30:53,992
Congratulations, brother.

341
00:30:54,242 --> 00:30:57,120
The news of Rajesh's engagement
has gladdened my heart.

342
00:30:58,246 --> 00:31:00,248
I've just been to the temple
to offer my prayers.

343
00:31:00,498 --> 00:31:02,334
She's coming from the beauty parlor.

344
00:31:02,500 --> 00:31:04,419
What happened?

345
00:31:05,545 --> 00:31:09,633
I've heard that daughter-in-law's
dad is a professor at college.

346
00:31:10,675 --> 00:31:12,761
In that case, there must not
have been any talks of dowry.

347
00:31:13,887 --> 00:31:16,932
He must be like him
a simpleton all his lif'é.

348
00:31:17,098 --> 00:31:21,102
Don't say that.
He's from a very big family.

349
00:31:21,353 --> 00:31:26,316
But he is his friend. Whatever
he gives has to be accepted.

350
00:31:26,525 --> 00:31:29,444
If my Sweetie were to come,
she would have brought a lot.

351
00:31:29,736 --> 00:31:31,530
So much that the safe wouldn't be
able to accommodate everything.

352
00:31:31,738 --> 00:31:33,615
My Rajesh is worth millions!

353
00:31:33,823 --> 00:31:36,785
Something worth millions is
being made.. Sweets!

354
00:31:37,035 --> 00:31:38,870
Rita baby is making it.
- Is baby making it?

355
00:31:39,120 --> 00:31:40,956
Will you taste it? - Give me some.

356
00:31:43,584 --> 00:31:45,669
Baby, is the sweet ready? - Yes.

357
00:31:45,919 --> 00:31:47,755
I've praised your sweet
a lot outside.

358
00:31:48,005 --> 00:31:50,883
Your aunt wants to die..
I mean taste it.

359
00:31:51,133 --> 00:31:52,968
I'll just go and give it.

360
00:31:54,094 --> 00:31:57,139
Baby, you've learnt a lot.

361
00:31:58,265 --> 00:32:00,267
Auntie, eat with this big spoon.
Baby has made it.

362
00:32:01,393 --> 00:32:03,395
Have it.

363
00:32:12,905 --> 00:32:14,907
What happened?
- Auntie liked the sweet a lot.

364
00:32:15,157 --> 00:32:16,992
Have all of this, auntie.

365
00:32:24,375 --> 00:32:27,419
Is this what you call sweet?
It's full of salt.

366
00:32:27,669 --> 00:32:30,547
Salt? - Yes. It's very bitter.

367
00:32:30,798 --> 00:32:32,633
My dear, it's your tongue
that's bitter.

368
00:32:32,883 --> 00:32:34,718
What did you say? - Nothing.

369
00:32:34,968 --> 00:32:36,804
The girl's family is about to come.
You wipe your face.

370
00:32:37,930 --> 00:32:42,017
Move aside with your sweet. - Rita,
you won't be able to make this sweet.

371
00:32:43,060 --> 00:32:48,273
If I can't make the sweet for you,
who will?

372
00:33:04,039 --> 00:33:06,041
Greetings. Please come.

373
00:33:07,167 --> 00:33:09,169
May you live long, son.
How are you?

374
00:33:31,150 --> 00:33:33,152
Are you studying computers? Wow.

375
00:33:33,444 --> 00:33:36,280
Nisha, Laloo and Chameli have
come to meet you.

376
00:33:37,448 --> 00:33:41,535
Meet him too, he happens to be the
most loved member of this family.

377
00:33:46,832 --> 00:33:50,919
Brother-in-law. You show us your
paintings. - Definitely, come.

378
00:33:52,046 --> 00:33:54,048
Rajesh, please come here, dear.

379
00:33:54,298 --> 00:33:57,176
This father-in-law of yours
is a very interesting person.

380
00:33:58,302 --> 00:34:02,389
I'll just be there. Prem, you
please show Nisha the paintings.

381
00:34:04,558 --> 00:34:06,560
Brother-in-law is truly great.

382
00:34:13,275 --> 00:34:17,363
I'll show you the most beautiful
painting done by my brother. Please come.

383
00:34:29,958 --> 00:34:31,960
How do you find it?

384
00:34:33,087 --> 00:34:37,174
Do you know to play the
instrument or are you just posing?

385
00:34:38,217 --> 00:34:40,302
People tell me that
I play very well.

386
00:34:40,469 --> 00:34:42,388
You may make a decision
when you hear it.

387
00:34:43,514 --> 00:34:48,644
I almost forgot. Sister has sent
this gift for you. - Bhabhi sent it?

388
00:34:49,812 --> 00:34:52,856
I told her that it wasn't necessary.

389
00:34:53,982 --> 00:34:54,942
Open it.

390
00:35:00,239 --> 00:35:04,326
Put it on your coat. It will make a
good impression on your girlfriends.

391
00:35:14,837 --> 00:35:16,839
Please help me put it.

392
00:35:17,965 --> 00:35:19,967
Move aside.

393
00:35:33,647 --> 00:35:35,649
Did that prick?

394
00:35:36,692 --> 00:35:40,863
So, just like that? - I would
have felt this way if it had pricked.

395
00:35:53,459 --> 00:35:55,461
What happened?
- This time, it pricked.

396
00:35:56,587 --> 00:35:58,589
When it pricks, it feels this way.

397
00:36:01,558 --> 00:36:04,602
You two are wanted downstairs.

398
00:36:04,894 --> 00:36:06,688
It's time for
the religious ceremony.

399
00:36:07,814 --> 00:36:10,859
Shall we go in Nisha?

400
00:36:11,150 --> 00:36:12,986
It's time for the relation
to be confirmed.

401
00:36:25,582 --> 00:36:28,626
Kailashnath.. Rajesh is ours now.

402
00:36:29,752 --> 00:36:31,754
Come and give me a hug.
Henceforth I won't be in demand.

403
00:36:32,005 --> 00:36:34,883
Why? - Well, I'm from the girl's side.
I have to bow down!

404
00:36:37,051 --> 00:36:40,096
We won't spare you two by
just hugging each other.

405
00:36:40,346 --> 00:36:42,182
What then? - We will have some
song and dance now.

406
00:36:43,308 --> 00:36:45,310
Get the musical instruments.

407
00:36:48,438 --> 00:36:50,523
The party is on but who will
put life into it?

408
00:36:50,815 --> 00:36:53,651
Shall I tell? It's a day of the
in-laws. One sing and the other dance.

409
00:36:55,778 --> 00:36:58,865
Dear in-law, sing something for us.
- Me? - Yes.

410
00:36:59,115 --> 00:37:02,035
I don't have that charm.
You're the charming one!

411
00:37:03,161 --> 00:37:05,163
Shall I reveal your secret? - No.

412
00:37:05,371 --> 00:37:07,290
You've done it to me so many times
when I was young? - Ouiet.

413
00:37:08,291 --> 00:37:10,376
I refer to the time when we
three used to study together.

414
00:37:11,503 --> 00:37:13,546
His uncle, me and my wife.

415
00:37:14,631 --> 00:37:16,633
Her smile is beyond
compare even today.

416
00:37:17,675 --> 00:37:20,803
There was a time when everyone
was dying for one look.

417
00:37:22,972 --> 00:37:24,974
I'll just be back.
- Where are you going?

418
00:37:25,183 --> 00:37:31,231
Among the ones crazy about her
smile was your loving uncle too!

419
00:37:32,357 --> 00:37:34,359
Uncle, you?

420
00:37:35,527 --> 00:37:37,529
Don't lie. Don't lie.

421
00:37:41,783 --> 00:37:44,828
Sing something for the sake of
your shyness and her smile.

422
00:37:45,954 --> 00:37:47,956
Rajesh, you please tell
your father-in-law.

423
00:37:51,167 --> 00:37:57,340
Why don't you request him on my
behalf. It will make a difference.

424
00:38:00,552 --> 00:38:02,554
Please sing something.

425
00:38:15,191 --> 00:38:24,492
There's this strange
conflict in my heart today.

426
00:38:25,577 --> 00:38:30,748
I'm singing and my in-law
is in front of me.

427
00:38:32,834 --> 00:38:38,047
I'd like to say something
that is on her heart too.

428
00:38:38,298 --> 00:38:44,304
I'm singing and my in-law
is in front of me.

429
00:39:07,368 --> 00:39:14,584
The earrings on her ears look
like the moon and the sun!

430
00:39:18,838 --> 00:39:26,054
The earrings on the ears look
like the moon and the sun!

431
00:39:26,304 --> 00:39:33,353
This ' Banarasi' sari
Iooks great too!

432
00:39:34,479 --> 00:39:39,609
I'll tell you a secret..
I'll tell you a secret.

433
00:39:39,818 --> 00:39:49,035
My in-law is tickled even today
when her anklets make a noise.

434
00:39:50,119 --> 00:39:59,462
It's a secret.. he is tickled even
today when her anklets make a noise.

435
00:40:43,381 --> 00:40:50,597
The smile on her lips..
the shyness of her eyes!

436
00:40:54,767 --> 00:41:02,066
The smile on her lips..
the shyness of her eyes!

437
00:41:03,109 --> 00:41:10,450
Such innocence is a boon!

438
00:41:10,700 --> 00:41:16,706
I'll tell you a secret..
I'll tell you a secret.

439
00:41:16,956 --> 00:41:21,961
My in-law is truly blessed! She is
like 'Laxmi' the goddess of wealth..

440
00:41:22,086 --> 00:41:25,048
..who has transformed this
house into heaven!

441
00:41:26,090 --> 00:41:31,304
My in-law is truly blessed! She is
like 'Laxmi' the goddess of wealth..

442
00:41:31,471 --> 00:41:36,518
..who has transformed this
house into heaven!

443
00:41:49,072 --> 00:41:54,285
There's this strange conflict
in my heart today.

444
00:41:54,536 --> 00:42:00,583
I'm singing and my in-law
is in front of me.

445
00:42:02,627 --> 00:42:07,841
What I have to live up to is
a very delicate relationship!

446
00:42:08,967 --> 00:42:14,138
I'm singing and my in-law
is in front of me.

447
00:42:29,779 --> 00:42:37,078
She's my shade who's moving
into your house.

448
00:42:41,332 --> 00:42:48,548
She's my shade who's moving
into your house.

449
00:42:49,674 --> 00:42:55,847
She's lived like a dream
on my eyelids!

450
00:42:56,973 --> 00:43:03,146
I'll tell you a secret..
I'll tell you a secret.

451
00:43:03,313 --> 00:43:06,274
This life time earnings of mine..

452
00:43:07,442 --> 00:43:12,614
..is the brilliance of your
Iawn henceforth.

453
00:43:13,615 --> 00:43:18,828
It's a secret, this life time
earnings of mine..

454
00:43:19,954 --> 00:43:24,000
..is the brilliance of
your lawn henceforth.

455
00:43:25,084 --> 00:43:30,256
It's a secret, this life time
earnings of mine..

456
00:43:30,507 --> 00:43:36,513
..is the brilliance of
your lawn henceforth.

457
00:43:50,235 --> 00:43:53,279
It seems that my sister will
die of hunger over here!

458
00:43:53,530 --> 00:43:56,407
Why? - Have a look, my brother-in-law
isn't eating anything.

459
00:43:56,616 --> 00:43:58,535
Take this, you feed him yourself.

460
00:43:59,619 --> 00:44:01,621
Open your mouth.

461
00:44:02,747 --> 00:44:05,792
If you feed him everything over here,
what will you do for the wedding?

462
00:44:06,042 --> 00:44:08,920
You'll come to know about our
hospitality when you come over.

463
00:44:10,046 --> 00:44:13,091
You'll come, won't you?
- I'll definitely come.

464
00:44:13,341 --> 00:44:15,176
When I come, there'll be
fireworks all around.

465
00:44:23,518 --> 00:44:25,603
Bring it here.

466
00:44:34,070 --> 00:44:38,158
What is it? - Please do us a favor.
Please have a seat here.

467
00:44:38,408 --> 00:44:41,286
I'm very busy Nisha, the marriage
procession is about to come.

468
00:44:41,494 --> 00:44:50,585
If you do our work, I will tell your
mom to choose a nice bride for you.

469
00:44:52,212 --> 00:44:54,255
All right then. Here I go.

470
00:44:58,468 --> 00:45:00,512
Sorry brother.

471
00:45:00,679 --> 00:45:02,555
Nisha, will you make your
brother-in-law sit here?

472
00:45:02,806 --> 00:45:06,768
He'll be sitting there. This seat
is for his brother and his friends.

473
00:45:07,811 --> 00:45:11,982
Let them too know
about our hospitality.

474
00:46:14,711 --> 00:46:16,755
I'll do the introductions.

475
00:46:17,839 --> 00:46:20,884
Uncle, can I have a group photograph.
- Why not?

476
00:46:21,092 --> 00:46:25,055
He's Bhola Prasad.
The son of my wife's brother.

477
00:46:26,097 --> 00:46:31,311
Bhola is doing research on
the works of Kalidas' Shakuntala.

478
00:46:31,603 --> 00:46:34,439
By the way, he's on the look out
for a Shakuntala of his own too.

479
00:46:35,565 --> 00:46:37,567
Let us click the photograph.
The stairs will be a nice place.

480
00:46:42,864 --> 00:46:44,908
Come on.

481
00:46:49,120 --> 00:46:51,164
It's perfume!

482
00:47:18,274 --> 00:47:20,360
Come, brother-in-law.
- Where are you taking him?

483
00:47:20,568 --> 00:47:23,530
He'll sit with us.
They all want to meet him.

484
00:47:23,780 --> 00:47:25,615
He's your brother-in-law!
Take him.

485
00:47:27,784 --> 00:47:30,829
You'll come too. - We too?

486
00:47:31,955 --> 00:47:33,957
We have to take care of you too!

487
00:47:35,083 --> 00:47:38,128
I smell a rat, brother.
- I like a challenge.

488
00:47:38,294 --> 00:47:43,341
Let's check it out. Friends
we'll be back soon.

489
00:47:45,510 --> 00:47:49,597
Escuse me. - What is it?
- You please don't go there.

490
00:47:49,764 --> 00:47:53,768
Why? - There's danger over there.
- Danger?

491
00:47:54,894 --> 00:47:56,896
Please have a seat, brother-in-law.

492
00:47:57,063 --> 00:48:00,025
You'll have a seat too.
- Should we sit over here?

493
00:48:00,317 --> 00:48:03,153
Come brother, come. Come fast.

494
00:48:05,363 --> 00:48:07,365
Please sit down. There won't be
a noise when you sit down.

495
00:48:12,662 --> 00:48:15,707
What did you say? - Nothing.

496
00:48:16,833 --> 00:48:19,878
Wait. I'd like to investigate.

497
00:48:48,156 --> 00:48:50,158
Is everything all right? - Yes,
everything is all right.

498
00:48:50,325 --> 00:48:53,286
Please sit. - Yes, we will sit
but there is a condition.

499
00:48:54,412 --> 00:48:56,414
You all will sit first.

500
00:48:59,626 --> 00:49:03,713
That's not done. You are the guest.
You please sit down.

501
00:49:06,925 --> 00:49:11,012
What's the matter, Prem? - Brother
one needs to be very cautious..

502
00:49:11,262 --> 00:49:14,140
..wherever your loving
sister-in-laws are present..

503
00:49:17,268 --> 00:49:19,354
I'll just be back, brother-in-law.
- Excuse me.

504
00:49:19,646 --> 00:49:23,525
Before you leave, please show me
the place where I can sit.

505
00:49:24,651 --> 00:49:27,737
Please come. I will give you
the most special seat.

506
00:49:28,863 --> 00:49:30,865
Don't feel shy. Please come.

507
00:49:31,992 --> 00:49:33,994
You go and sit there. On top of it.

508
00:49:41,292 --> 00:49:43,378
What happened?

509
00:49:44,504 --> 00:49:46,506
What news have you brought?

510
00:49:46,673 --> 00:49:51,720
They've kept brother-in-law's shoes
in a red and yellow sweet box.

511
00:49:57,017 --> 00:50:02,147
Sister, why are we stealing
the shoes? It's bad to steal.

512
00:50:03,189 --> 00:50:06,318
This is a tradition. We'll get cash
from brother-in-law for the shoes.

513
00:50:08,403 --> 00:50:12,615
The red and yellow sweet box.
The fun starts now.

514
00:50:16,870 --> 00:50:22,000
Nobody will doubt that
we have hidden the shoes here.

515
00:50:22,167 --> 00:50:26,171
Be quiet. We have a lot
of enemies over here.

516
00:50:27,297 --> 00:50:29,299
Bhabhi is coming.

517
00:50:58,620 --> 00:51:02,707
Are you Prem? - Yes.
- There's a call for you.

518
00:51:02,957 --> 00:51:04,793
My call? Who can it be?

519
00:51:05,919 --> 00:51:07,921
Be cautious. I'll just be back.

520
00:51:19,474 --> 00:51:23,561
Do you recognize? I'm Suman.
- Who Suman?

521
00:51:25,647 --> 00:51:31,903
The one who was sitting with
you is calling you.

522
00:51:33,071 --> 00:51:36,116
You go ahead. I'll just come.

523
00:51:37,242 --> 00:51:40,286
Tuffy, be cautious.
I'll be back soon.

524
00:52:02,267 --> 00:52:04,269
Tuffy, will you be my friend?

525
00:52:07,480 --> 00:52:09,482
This is Munia and this is Gudia.

526
00:52:15,864 --> 00:52:17,866
Come on.

527
00:52:26,207 --> 00:52:28,293
Hide it on the table, fast.

528
00:52:36,718 --> 00:52:38,720
Believe me, I don't know
any Suman or her dad.

529
00:52:39,763 --> 00:52:46,019
What? I loved her? When?
I see, in my last birth?

530
00:52:48,104 --> 00:52:51,232
Tell me something.
How is Nisha for this birth?

531
00:52:53,443 --> 00:52:56,446
Hung up? These girls
are truly selfish.

532
00:53:00,742 --> 00:53:04,829
What are you doing here? - I was
waiting for you to finish your talks.

533
00:53:05,080 --> 00:53:07,957
You called me, didn't you? - Yes,
I.. did I call?

534
00:53:08,208 --> 00:53:11,086
Yes you called me and now you deny it.

535
00:53:13,254 --> 00:53:15,256
We're finished.

536
00:53:20,470 --> 00:53:22,555
That breathes life into me!
I was so afraid.

537
00:53:23,682 --> 00:53:27,769
I'll check it up. It's full
of sweets. - What nonsense?

538
00:53:30,981 --> 00:53:32,983
The shoes have turned to sweets.

539
00:53:33,274 --> 00:53:35,068
Have a look.

540
00:53:37,278 --> 00:53:40,323
Sweets look good in a sweet boK.

541
00:53:57,090 --> 00:54:00,135
Prem brother, these girls
have truly fooled us.

542
00:54:01,177 --> 00:54:05,348
Have you accepted defeat so soon?
- Defeat? No way.

543
00:54:08,560 --> 00:54:11,604
I'll just be back with some courage.

544
00:54:14,816 --> 00:54:22,073
Oh Lord, you are the worker of
miracles. You can do anything.

545
00:54:22,324 --> 00:54:28,330
Lord, please do something so that
we win and they're the fools.

546
00:54:28,580 --> 00:54:31,458
Please do something, Lord.
Please do something.

547
00:54:34,586 --> 00:54:37,714
It'll come off in public. Are you
keen on insulting me in public?

548
00:54:38,840 --> 00:54:40,842
I think he wants to
take us somewhere.

549
00:54:41,968 --> 00:54:43,970
I guess he knows where the shoes are.

550
00:54:47,182 --> 00:54:49,184
You have worked a miracle, Oh Lord.

551
00:54:50,310 --> 00:54:52,312
Come on.

552
00:54:53,104 --> 00:54:54,897
Brother, here are the shoes.

553
00:54:55,940 --> 00:55:02,196
Now go and keep this
box in that place.

554
00:55:03,239 --> 00:55:09,537
Hide the shoes in such a place
where she just won't find it.

555
00:55:15,793 --> 00:55:19,964
Definitely not. - Children,
please listen to me.

556
00:55:20,214 --> 00:55:24,135
Let's settle for 500 rupees.
- Definitely not.

557
00:55:24,385 --> 00:55:28,306
We will take nothing less than 1001.
Only then shall we give the shoes.

558
00:55:28,556 --> 00:55:30,391
What do you say dad? - Yes,
this is a rare opportunity.

559
00:55:30,817 --> 00:55:35,947
Ask unflinchingly. Rajesh,
do be seated bare footed.

560
00:55:37,073 --> 00:55:39,075
You are amazing. You're sitting
amongst these children!

561
00:55:39,367 --> 00:55:43,246
Get up Nisha. It's getting late.
- Getting late? Definitely not.

562
00:55:43,538 --> 00:55:46,416
Repeat along with me.
1001 rupees cash.

563
00:55:49,628 --> 00:55:53,715
It's time for me to get up now.
- Why?

564
00:55:55,884 --> 00:55:58,929
Is it your wedding?
- No child, I was..

565
00:55:59,179 --> 00:56:01,014
In that case, you please sit down.

566
00:56:02,140 --> 00:56:05,185
Doctor, these sister-in-laws
are very smart.

567
00:56:05,435 --> 00:56:08,313
Where's our tiger?
- I'm over here, uncle.

568
00:56:11,525 --> 00:56:15,612
You are amazing. Instead of helping
us, you are busy eating.

569
00:56:16,738 --> 00:56:21,868
Say something. - You do the negotiations
first. I'll speak at the end.

570
00:56:25,122 --> 00:56:29,209
What do you say? - Well children,
now.. - Definitely not.

571
00:56:29,244 --> 00:56:30,994
Well Rajesh, give the cash.

572
00:56:33,163 --> 00:56:35,165
Just a minute uncle.

573
00:56:36,208 --> 00:56:40,379
Uncle, tell them to give the shoes
first and then take the cash.

574
00:56:40,629 --> 00:56:42,464
That's perfect. Give with one
hand and take with the other.

575
00:56:43,590 --> 00:56:45,592
That's fantastic Prem.
- All right. We'll get the shoes.

576
00:57:00,274 --> 00:57:02,276
For a beautiful girl..
a beautiful gift.

577
00:57:09,700 --> 00:57:11,702
Sister, who has taken the shoes?

578
00:57:26,383 --> 00:57:31,513
You sister-in-law's of the groom
with the green drapes.

579
00:57:31,763 --> 00:57:35,684
You sister-in-law's of the
groom with the green drapes.

580
00:57:35,934 --> 00:57:39,855
Return the shoes and take the cash.

581
00:57:40,147 --> 00:57:45,068
Return the shoes and take the cash.

582
00:57:50,407 --> 00:57:54,495
You brother-in-law of the bride
don't show off so much.

583
00:57:55,621 --> 00:57:59,708
You brother-in-law of the bride
don't show off so much.

584
00:57:59,958 --> 00:58:09,092
Give the cash and take the shoes.
Give the cash and take the shoes.

585
00:58:09,343 --> 00:58:11,178
Return the shoes and take the cash.

586
00:59:00,770 --> 00:59:03,898
Count the cash. - Get the shoes.

587
00:59:04,190 --> 00:59:05,983
Enough of your fuss.
- Get the shoes.

588
00:59:06,275 --> 00:59:08,069
Am I a fraud?
- You should know better.

589
00:59:08,361 --> 00:59:14,367
You are stubborn. - Whatever you say.

590
00:59:15,409 --> 00:59:18,537
Things will get out of control.
- So be it.

591
00:59:18,788 --> 00:59:20,623
We'll demand more. - Doesn't matter.

592
00:59:20,790 --> 00:59:26,879
Don't act smart. - The shoes first.
- The cash first.

593
00:59:28,005 --> 00:59:32,093
We've taken the shoes
not robbed some jewelr'ý.

594
00:59:32,343 --> 00:59:36,263
You brother-in-law of the bride
don't show off so much.

595
00:59:37,390 --> 00:59:41,477
Give the cash and take the shoes.

596
00:59:41,727 --> 00:59:46,691
Give the cash and take the shoes.

597
00:59:46,983 --> 00:59:48,776
Return the shoes and take the cash.

598
00:59:49,068 --> 00:59:50,861
Return the shoes and take the cash.

599
01:00:30,985 --> 01:00:32,987
Have a drink. - Not in the mood.

600
01:00:33,237 --> 01:00:35,072
Have some snacks. - Not in the mood.

601
01:00:35,323 --> 01:00:38,200
Have an ice cream. - We've had a lot.

602
01:00:38,451 --> 01:00:41,329
Have a 'paan' - We've had a lot.

603
01:00:44,540 --> 01:00:47,585
Some 'rasmalai'. - It's for you.

604
01:00:47,835 --> 01:00:49,670
So much of sweet. - It's for you.

605
01:00:49,837 --> 01:00:52,798
The shoes first. - Will you eat them?

606
01:00:53,090 --> 01:00:55,926
As you wish! - Not at all.

607
01:00:57,053 --> 01:01:02,183
You tuneless songs of some lousy poet.

608
01:01:02,475 --> 01:01:06,395
You sister-in-law's of the groom
with the green drapes.

609
01:01:06,646 --> 01:01:10,566
Return the shoes and take the cash.

610
01:01:11,692 --> 01:01:15,780
Return the shoes and take the cash.

611
01:01:30,461 --> 01:01:32,463
Return the shoes and take the cash.

612
01:01:32,713 --> 01:01:37,677
Return the shoes and take the cash.

613
01:03:23,199 --> 01:03:25,201
Give the cash and take the shoes.

614
01:03:25,451 --> 01:03:32,500
Give the cash and take the shoes.

615
01:04:21,549 --> 01:04:27,805
Whatever I've learnt from here..

616
01:04:28,014 --> 01:04:31,976
..I'm taking it all along
with me to my house.

617
01:04:36,272 --> 01:04:44,530
I'm taking it to my house.
I'm leaving for my house.

618
01:04:45,573 --> 01:04:51,829
With these memories
your beloved is leaving!..

619
01:04:52,079 --> 01:04:56,000
..for an unknown house.

620
01:05:22,507 --> 01:05:26,595
How can I forget, dad..

621
01:05:26,845 --> 01:05:31,808
..all the stories that
I've heard from you?

622
01:05:32,934 --> 01:05:35,979
Mom, I'm leaving back..

623
01:05:36,229 --> 01:05:41,193
..all the memories of my childhood!

624
01:05:42,319 --> 01:05:51,620
My loving sister, take care of
that house too the same way.

625
01:06:20,941 --> 01:06:29,199
This house of my birth has
become alien to me now.

626
01:06:30,325 --> 01:06:34,413
I've found myself a new world!

627
01:06:34,704 --> 01:06:38,583
I' m tied up now to
this new relation.

628
01:06:39,626 --> 01:06:45,924
My father-in-law is my dad and
my husband is my God now.

629
01:06:46,174 --> 01:06:50,095
My brother-in-law is
like Lord Krishna.

630
01:06:54,349 --> 01:07:02,607
I'm leaving for my house..
I'm leaving for my house.

631
01:08:08,465 --> 01:08:11,510
May you live long and always
be a bride!

632
01:08:12,636 --> 01:08:14,638
Please come.

633
01:08:15,764 --> 01:08:17,766
You come here.
Where are you going?

634
01:08:18,892 --> 01:08:20,894
You're happy, right? You are
responsible for this relation.

635
01:08:21,144 --> 01:08:22,979
What all has that professor given.

636
01:08:23,230 --> 01:08:29,236
He's given a lot. Diamond necklace,
imported car, TV and VCR.

637
01:08:29,486 --> 01:08:31,321
Did you get it all? - No. - Why?

638
01:08:31,571 --> 01:08:36,535
When we weighed all that against
the weight of our Bhabhi..

639
01:08:36,701 --> 01:08:39,663
..the weight of all that goods
was negligible so we left it there.

640
01:08:40,789 --> 01:08:43,834
And you, were you just applauding
the act? What is this?

641
01:08:44,126 --> 01:08:45,961
I'll give this to our
daughter-in-law as a blessing.

642
01:08:46,211 --> 01:08:48,046
Yes, give her the books. If it
was my Sweetie who had come..

643
01:08:48,296 --> 01:08:50,132
..I would have laded her with gold.

644
01:08:52,300 --> 01:08:55,345
Daughter-in-law, this necklace
belongs to Rajesh's mom.

645
01:08:56,388 --> 01:08:58,473
You alone are the wealth
of this house now!

646
01:09:03,770 --> 01:09:06,815
May you live long! This is
for you, daughter-in-law.

647
01:09:07,858 --> 01:09:10,986
I'm giving you 'The Ramayan'.
Sita is in it!

648
01:09:15,157 --> 01:09:18,285
The way a ring is enhanced by
the presence of a diamond..

649
01:09:18,577 --> 01:09:24,541
..it's my sincere wish that you two
always live happily in the same way.

650
01:09:25,584 --> 01:09:27,669
Take this, Rajesh, my child.
- Doctor uncle, I..

651
01:09:28,837 --> 01:09:30,839
What are you looking at your uncle?

652
01:09:31,006 --> 01:09:32,924
Didn't you take pennies from me
when you went to school?

653
01:09:34,051 --> 01:09:36,053
Now that you are big,
have you become rich?

654
01:09:37,179 --> 01:09:39,181
Keep it. - At least don't scold
him this way in front of her.

655
01:09:40,307 --> 01:09:43,351
I will scold him this way even
in front of his children!

656
01:09:46,563 --> 01:09:49,608
This is for you. Distribute
all this among the rest.

657
01:09:50,734 --> 01:09:55,864
Come here Laloo. Daughter-in-law,
this is Laloo, my son.

658
01:09:56,114 --> 01:09:58,992
Take this. - No Sir
you have given me such espect.

659
01:09:59,284 --> 01:10:03,163
You've also given me such a
good sister-in-law. I'm blessed.

660
01:10:04,289 --> 01:10:06,291
Will you at least accept it from
the hands of your sister-in-law?

661
01:10:06,583 --> 01:10:09,461
Didn't you tell me that Pooja
resembles your own sister-in-law?

662
01:10:09,711 --> 01:10:12,589
Just consider that she is in front
of you and is offering it to you.

663
01:10:18,845 --> 01:10:20,931
What will I get uncle?

664
01:10:21,181 --> 01:10:23,016
Yes brother, give your
younger one something too.

665
01:10:24,059 --> 01:10:26,144
What he'll get is some duty.

666
01:10:26,395 --> 01:10:30,315
Well, the sister-in-law loves
her brother-in-law the most.

667
01:10:30,565 --> 01:10:33,443
So make sure that she never ever
Iongs for her maternal home.

668
01:10:33,610 --> 01:10:35,529
Have you understood? - Yes,
I have understood, uncle.

669
01:10:36,655 --> 01:10:38,657
I promise that I will give my
sister-in-law all the happiness!

670
01:10:40,523 --> 01:10:43,567
What's happening?
- She's teaching me to speak English.

671
01:10:43,818 --> 01:10:45,653
Write, Jawaharlal Nehru.

672
01:10:46,779 --> 01:10:49,824
Should I start Jawaharlal with
a J or a D? - Start with a Z.

673
01:10:50,950 --> 01:10:53,994
You are fooling me. - You fool,
does anyone study on a Sunday?

674
01:10:54,520 --> 01:10:56,522
Bhabhi, let's play cricket.

675
01:10:56,773 --> 01:10:59,651
She'll not go anywhere. - Come here.
- What's the matter?

676
01:11:00,777 --> 01:11:02,779
Chameli, try and explain to him.

677
01:11:03,029 --> 01:11:05,907
I've had a tough time getting
brother to agree to play cricket.

678
01:11:06,950 --> 01:11:09,035
Have you understood anything,
you fool?

679
01:11:11,204 --> 01:11:14,249
Sister-in-law, let's keep the
rest of the studies for tomorrow.

680
01:11:15,291 --> 01:11:19,504
Come Bhabhi. - But Prem
I don't know to play cricke!t.

681
01:11:19,671 --> 01:11:21,589
In that case, you sit and watch.
- Yes, sister-in-law.

682
01:11:21,839 --> 01:11:23,675
There are clouds in the sky..

683
01:11:25,843 --> 01:11:27,845
Brother, it's your turn to bat.
Let's go.

684
01:11:38,356 --> 01:11:41,401
What's happening? - Come on,
Iet's play cricket.

685
01:11:43,570 --> 01:11:45,572
You move this side. Field properly.

686
01:11:45,822 --> 01:11:47,657
Are you through with your fielding?
- Take this, big brother.

687
01:11:47,907 --> 01:11:51,828
Hey Prem, at a cricket ground,
there's no permission to only watch.

688
01:11:52,954 --> 01:11:54,956
One has to play too.

689
01:11:59,252 --> 01:12:04,382
All right. Bhabhi,
you will have to bowl. - Me?

690
01:12:04,632 --> 01:12:06,467
It's a matter of prestige. - No.

691
01:12:06,634 --> 01:12:08,553
It's very easy. You just have
to do this much.

692
01:12:09,679 --> 01:12:12,724
Spectators, a loud round of
applause for our new player.

693
01:12:13,850 --> 01:12:15,852
Come on.

694
01:12:16,978 --> 01:12:18,980
Our new player is moving towards
the bowling crease.

695
01:12:28,448 --> 01:12:30,450
I guess I said something wrong.

696
01:12:48,301 --> 01:12:50,303
Our new player has grabbed
the attention of one and all.

697
01:12:50,553 --> 01:12:53,431
Of the very first ball, she has
clean bowled a seasoned player.

698
01:12:54,557 --> 01:12:56,559
Bhabhi, it's your turn to bat now.

699
01:12:57,685 --> 01:13:00,730
Our new player is moving
towards the batting crease.

700
01:13:15,411 --> 01:13:17,413
Shall we?

701
01:13:20,542 --> 01:13:23,670
The match has entered
a very crucial moment now.

702
01:13:23,962 --> 01:13:26,839
Our seasoned player has rolled
back his sleeves.

703
01:13:27,090 --> 01:13:29,968
He is all excited and is
out for revenge.

704
01:13:33,179 --> 01:13:38,309
Our new player has taken her
position with absolute confidence.

705
01:13:40,478 --> 01:13:43,523
The ball has been bowled.. and
the ball is racing towards the sky.

706
01:13:43,731 --> 01:13:46,651
It's racing towards
the boundary and.. and..

707
01:14:08,673 --> 01:14:10,675
Tuffy, you fool!

708
01:14:50,423 --> 01:14:53,468
Bhabhi, you're the treasure
house of happiness!

709
01:15:33,216 --> 01:15:37,345
From the time the
first rays show up..

710
01:15:38,429 --> 01:15:42,517
..my bhabhi is awake
from that time.

711
01:15:43,643 --> 01:15:47,730
She takes care of all and works
till late in the evening.

712
01:15:48,815 --> 01:15:51,901
From the time the first
rays show up..

713
01:15:53,027 --> 01:15:57,115
..my bhabhi is awake
from that time.

714
01:15:58,157 --> 01:16:03,371
I've been missing all
this since childhood!

715
01:16:58,801 --> 01:17:01,846
I'll be married too!

716
01:17:04,015 --> 01:17:08,144
All of them seem to be telling me so.

717
01:17:09,229 --> 01:17:13,316
You make a choice and
don't listen to anyone.

718
01:17:13,566 --> 01:17:17,487
I'll be married too!

719
01:17:18,613 --> 01:17:22,742
All of them seem to
be telling me so.

720
01:17:23,826 --> 01:17:27,914
You search for a replica of
yourself and get her here.

721
01:18:19,173 --> 01:18:23,261
Till when should I be the youngest?

722
01:18:24,387 --> 01:18:28,474
Let someone younger
than me come too.

723
01:18:29,601 --> 01:18:33,688
Give these arms of mine
a laughing and talking toy!

724
01:18:34,814 --> 01:18:37,859
Till when should I be the youngest?

725
01:18:38,943 --> 01:18:44,115
Let someone younger
than me come too.

726
01:18:45,241 --> 01:18:49,287
We ask of you for a lovely offering!

727
01:18:59,797 --> 01:19:01,883
Bhabhi, you're the treasure
house of happiness!

728
01:19:23,463 --> 01:19:26,508
Come brother.
- All the work is over.

729
01:19:26,758 --> 01:19:29,636
I've spoken to the confectioner and
have told him about the function..

730
01:19:29,928 --> 01:19:32,806
..that we have to celebrate the
arrival of a new member in our family.

731
01:19:43,275 --> 01:19:48,446
Daughter-in-law, you've transformed
Laloo into an Englishman.

732
01:19:51,575 --> 01:19:53,660
How will a monkey appreciate
the taste of ginger?!

733
01:20:03,128 --> 01:20:05,130
Ginger tea, auntie.

734
01:20:06,256 --> 01:20:09,301
Oh, henna problem, no problem.

735
01:20:11,470 --> 01:20:13,472
That's great!

736
01:20:15,640 --> 01:20:17,642
This tea is really good.

737
01:20:18,810 --> 01:20:20,770
But uncle
why are you laughing so much?

738
01:20:21,062 --> 01:20:22,898
Well, call up the professor.

739
01:20:23,982 --> 01:20:27,068
I'd like to ask them about their
time of arrival for the function.

740
01:20:39,664 --> 01:20:41,666
Who?

741
01:20:45,921 --> 01:20:50,050
You! Tell me.
- Your sister will speak to you.

742
01:20:56,348 --> 01:20:58,350
Talk to mummy.

743
01:20:59,476 --> 01:21:01,478
May you live long, child!

744
01:21:01,770 --> 01:21:04,648
Well, it seems difficult for us
to come for the function.

745
01:21:04,815 --> 01:21:08,819
You find it difficult to come?
Talk to uncle.

746
01:21:12,030 --> 01:21:14,032
Greetings. What's the matter?

747
01:21:14,282 --> 01:21:19,246
His college eKams, instead of
being postponed are due these days.

748
01:21:20,372 --> 01:21:22,374
But at least somebody should come.

749
01:21:24,543 --> 01:21:28,672
At least send Nisha.
- Just a second.

750
01:21:28,880 --> 01:21:30,715
Will you go?
- To sister's place? Yes!

751
01:21:30,966 --> 01:21:32,801
Nisha will be coming. - All right.

752
01:21:33,009 --> 01:21:34,886
Prem will be there tomorrow
to pick up Nisha.

753
01:21:35,178 --> 01:21:36,972
You'll go, right Prem?

754
01:21:39,141 --> 01:21:41,143
Yes, I'll go.

755
01:21:51,174 --> 01:21:54,219
Get up child.
Get ready fast. Get up.

756
01:21:59,474 --> 01:22:01,518
What is this, mom?

757
01:22:02,386 --> 01:22:04,388
What a girl you are!

758
01:22:04,639 --> 01:22:07,874
Get up child.
Prem should be here any moment.

759
01:22:20,683 --> 01:22:22,768
Your slave is at your service!

760
01:22:38,593 --> 01:22:41,638
For what? - For waiting for me.

761
01:22:41,888 --> 01:22:44,723
I didn't wait for you.

762
01:22:44,849 --> 01:22:47,936
In that case, were you counting stars
in the day on the roof?

763
01:22:52,748 --> 01:22:57,920
People say, when a beautiful girl lies
she looks more beautiful.

764
01:23:02,174 --> 01:23:04,176
Have you come, son?

765
01:23:06,788 --> 01:23:08,790
How are you, auntie?.. Where's uncle?

766
01:23:09,040 --> 01:23:11,918
Good morning, son. A special snack.

767
01:23:13,002 --> 01:23:15,046
Taste it. - Uncle, have you made it?

768
01:23:16,089 --> 01:23:18,174
It's your auntie's favorite.

769
01:23:18,425 --> 01:23:22,345
It's a secret. This snack mi Ked
with butter pleases the wife.

770
01:23:23,471 --> 01:23:25,515
Actually, we aren't on talking
terms for the past few days.

771
01:23:26,558 --> 01:23:28,601
Why auntie?
- It's our daughter's first child.

772
01:23:28,810 --> 01:23:31,729
It's the ceremony to welcome the
child and we're not going!

773
01:23:32,856 --> 01:23:34,858
I'll take you with much fanfare on
the birth of our grand child.

774
01:23:35,150 --> 01:23:37,986
At least taste it now.
Catch her hand. Taste it.

775
01:23:45,159 --> 01:23:48,204
Can I ask you something? Why do
I get these flowers today?

776
01:23:48,454 --> 01:23:51,290
Basically, whenever we've met,
we've always fought.

777
01:23:52,374 --> 01:23:55,503
Flowers were the best way to
strengthen this acquaintance.

778
01:23:56,629 --> 01:24:00,716
Why did you ask me to forgive you
while leaving after the marriage?

779
01:24:00,966 --> 01:24:02,802
I was just trying to impress you.

780
01:24:04,970 --> 01:24:09,099
If I tell you the fact, you will
humor me. - I won't. Tell me.

781
01:24:09,350 --> 01:24:12,228
It was that touching moment!
We were taking Bhabhi home.

782
01:24:12,436 --> 01:24:14,313
You were bidding her good bye.

783
01:24:15,439 --> 01:24:18,484
Thought to myself, why not
share some of your sorrows.

784
01:24:19,568 --> 01:24:23,697
Have you seen that Tuffy?
A genuine man has no value!

785
01:24:25,866 --> 01:24:27,868
I wasn't laughing at you.

786
01:24:28,035 --> 01:24:29,954
Sometimes, a human errs
in judging a person.

787
01:24:30,204 --> 01:24:34,166
You aren't the type I thought you
were when I first met you.

788
01:24:35,251 --> 01:24:39,338
How am I then? - I'll think of
it at leisure and tell you.

789
01:24:40,464 --> 01:24:44,510
There's a surprise for you
in the back seat.

790
01:24:44,844 --> 01:24:46,679
Have a look.

791
01:24:51,976 --> 01:24:53,978
For you.

792
01:24:54,228 --> 01:24:58,149
What's the matter, Tuffy?
Flowers first, then chocolates!

793
01:24:58,399 --> 01:25:00,276
Is it some special day?

794
01:25:00,484 --> 01:25:03,362
For the first time today, a girl is
sitting on the front seat of my car.

795
01:25:06,574 --> 01:25:08,576
People say that this day occurs
in every person's life.

796
01:25:09,702 --> 01:25:12,788
Today happens to be that
special day for me.

797
01:25:18,043 --> 01:25:20,045
What happened? - Nothing.

798
01:25:21,172 --> 01:25:25,259
I'm sharing my secrets with you
and you' re with your comics.

799
01:25:26,343 --> 01:25:28,387
It's not allowed to read or
write while travelling.

800
01:25:28,679 --> 01:25:31,515
Travel should be full of song and
fun. What do you say, Tuffy?

801
01:25:32,683 --> 01:25:37,813
From the time I saw you singing
on the roof, I'm your fan.

802
01:25:38,898 --> 01:25:41,984
You share some secrets too.

803
01:25:42,193 --> 01:25:44,069
I won't tell anyone.
- Some other time.

804
01:25:45,196 --> 01:25:47,198
Why? - I've a sore throat.

805
01:25:49,366 --> 01:25:53,454
Tuffy, before the third comic is
opened, I guess I have to impress her.

806
01:26:19,647 --> 01:26:24,777
The drapes are flying
in the cold breeze.

807
01:26:25,027 --> 01:26:29,990
The heart is beating fast,
it's because of the teen age.

808
01:26:30,157 --> 01:26:40,417
No control over the heart..
what sort of magic is this?

809
01:26:46,757 --> 01:26:51,887
T'is the magic of the season, dear!

810
01:26:52,128 --> 01:26:56,088
No control over the heart now, dear!

811
01:26:57,138 --> 01:27:02,098
My gaze has lost and gone insane..

812
01:27:02,308 --> 01:27:07,107
..the sight of you
is so breathtaking.

813
01:27:13,747 --> 01:27:18,698
T'is the magic of the season, pal!

814
01:27:30,168 --> 01:27:35,128
This fair girl with the city boy..

815
01:27:35,338 --> 01:27:40,138
..looks like the shining moon!

816
01:27:46,178 --> 01:27:49,138
These beautiful flowers
and the buds..

817
01:27:49,348 --> 01:27:52,138
..this naughty call of the wind!

818
01:27:57,197 --> 01:27:59,157
These beautiful flowers
and the buds..

819
01:27:59,357 --> 01:28:02,147
..this naughty call of the wind!

820
01:28:02,178 --> 01:28:07,428
They signal to me to spend
my time over here.

821
01:28:07,608 --> 01:28:17,568
Previously, never ever would
these flowers talk to me this way!

822
01:28:18,318 --> 01:28:23,268
T'is the magic of the season, dear!

823
01:28:23,297 --> 01:28:28,257
No control over the heart, dear!

824
01:28:29,327 --> 01:28:34,287
My gaze has lost and gone insane..

825
01:28:34,497 --> 01:28:40,297
..the sight of you
is so breathtaking.

826
01:28:45,137 --> 01:28:50,097
T'is the magic of the season, dear!

827
01:29:23,177 --> 01:29:28,137
Tell the truth and don't
keep it a secret.

828
01:29:28,347 --> 01:29:33,548
From where have you'll come
and where do you want to go?

829
01:29:39,187 --> 01:29:44,148
I' m taking her with me to my place.
