1
00:02:55,660 --> 00:02:58,618
They're going mad, sir.
It's the students.

2
00:03:01,500 --> 00:03:02,979
All right. Let them in.

3
00:03:16,700 --> 00:03:18,133
- Swine!
- Beasts!

4
00:03:37,020 --> 00:03:40,410
- Into the valley of death...
- Into the jaws of hell...

5
00:03:40,500 --> 00:03:42,536
..rode the 600!

6
00:03:45,380 --> 00:03:47,132
Hey, hey. Ease up.

7
00:03:48,780 --> 00:03:50,611
You're sitting on my cloak.

8
00:03:51,580 --> 00:03:54,731
- Something up down below?
- Not a sausage.

9
00:03:54,820 --> 00:03:57,209
- Ah. Here you are, Terry.
- Thank you.

10
00:04:42,940 --> 00:04:44,532
I can't see him anywhere.

11
00:04:44,620 --> 00:04:46,531
- Programs.
- 0h. Two, please.

12
00:04:46,620 --> 00:04:49,453
0ne here. Thanks, pal.

13
00:04:51,820 --> 00:04:53,617
Quite a turnout down below.

14
00:04:53,700 --> 00:04:56,578
0ld Palmer's music
had better be good.

15
00:04:56,660 --> 00:05:00,096
Boronskaja wouldn't dance
the leading role if it wasn't.

16
00:05:02,300 --> 00:05:05,690
- Boro who?
- Who exactly is Boronskaja?

17
00:05:05,780 --> 00:05:09,898
Since you've stood in a queue for
six hours waiting to see her dance...

18
00:05:09,980 --> 00:05:12,574
Not to see anybody. To hear.

19
00:05:13,660 --> 00:05:16,652
Have you ever heard
of Professor Palmer?

20
00:05:16,740 --> 00:05:18,696
- Never.
- You will.

21
00:05:20,380 --> 00:05:23,929
The program says, "Heart 0f Fire,
music by Andrew Palmer."

22
00:05:24,020 --> 00:05:27,376
- 0ur professor.
- Boro-what's-her-name best be good.

23
00:05:27,460 --> 00:05:31,055
She's hardly likely
to be anything else.

24
00:05:41,100 --> 00:05:43,773
There he is. Palmer!

25
00:06:10,180 --> 00:06:11,408
Livy!

26
00:06:11,500 --> 00:06:14,060
Come on, Livy!

27
00:06:15,460 --> 00:06:17,132
We know him.

28
00:07:16,700 --> 00:07:19,373
Do you remember
my Cytherean Rhapsody?

29
00:07:19,460 --> 00:07:21,974
- Forget it.
- That's it. Your rhapsody.

30
00:07:22,060 --> 00:07:24,858
- It must be an accident.
- Did you show him?

31
00:07:24,940 --> 00:07:27,773
- I show him all my work.
- You think he lifted it?

32
00:07:27,860 --> 00:07:29,134
Shh!

33
00:08:31,940 --> 00:08:34,010
She's a great patron of the arts.

34
00:08:45,380 --> 00:08:49,851
Vicky. Vicky.

35
00:09:02,420 --> 00:09:04,775
Vicky.

36
00:09:04,860 --> 00:09:06,816
Lermontov's coming.

37
00:09:17,180 --> 00:09:21,093
- I say! That's yours, too, isn't it?
- Yes.

38
00:10:23,380 --> 00:10:25,018
Steady, old boy.

39
00:10:26,220 --> 00:10:27,858
Well, what are you waiting for?

40
00:10:27,940 --> 00:10:29,419
Shh!

41
00:10:37,820 --> 00:10:40,971
Please, do you mind?

42
00:10:43,260 --> 00:10:45,137
0h, really!

43
00:10:55,900 --> 00:11:00,530
Dear Professor, we're very proud of
you. I hope you're proud of yourself.

44
00:11:00,620 --> 00:11:02,770
You're too kind. Monsieur Lermontov.

45
00:11:02,860 --> 00:11:05,897
- We meet the great man at last.
- Enchanté, madame.

46
00:11:05,980 --> 00:11:08,858
I never imagined I'd succeed
in getting you here.

47
00:11:08,940 --> 00:11:10,931
I must be a very clever woman.

48
00:11:21,180 --> 00:11:24,331
If some fat harridan
is going to sing, I must go.

49
00:11:24,420 --> 00:11:27,890
- I can't bear amateurs.
- Neither can Lady Neston.

50
00:11:27,980 --> 00:11:31,939
- What do you mean?
- She has a niece who dances.

51
00:11:32,020 --> 00:11:33,248
Professionally.

52
00:11:39,540 --> 00:11:40,689
Hello, Professor.

53
00:11:40,780 --> 00:11:45,171
Now, please don't get up,
Mr Lermontov.

54
00:11:45,260 --> 00:11:48,536
Now, are you prepared for a surprise?

55
00:11:48,620 --> 00:11:51,339
Do you mean a surprise or a shock?

56
00:11:51,420 --> 00:11:56,938
Well, to take the plunge,
I've asked my niece to dance tonight.

57
00:11:57,020 --> 00:11:59,580
What would you call that?

58
00:11:59,660 --> 00:12:00,775
A shock.

59
00:12:02,380 --> 00:12:05,929
0h, well,
you're certainly very candid.

60
00:12:06,020 --> 00:12:07,578
You know, Mr Lermontov,

61
00:12:07,660 --> 00:12:11,892
I wouldn't dream of boring you
with the performance of an amateur.

62
00:12:11,980 --> 00:12:15,609
My niece has been dancing leading
roles for some time now.

63
00:12:15,700 --> 00:12:17,930
The critics think highly of her work.

64
00:12:18,020 --> 00:12:21,729
How would you define ballet,
Lady Neston?

65
00:12:21,820 --> 00:12:26,848
Well...one might call it
the poetry of motion, perhaps, or...

66
00:12:26,940 --> 00:12:31,092
0ne might. But for me,
it is a great deal more.

67
00:12:31,180 --> 00:12:33,569
For me, it is a religion.

68
00:12:33,660 --> 00:12:35,616
And one doesn't really care

69
00:12:35,700 --> 00:12:41,969
to see one's religion practised
in an atmosphere such as this.

70
00:12:42,060 --> 00:12:44,016
I hope you understand.

71
00:12:47,100 --> 00:12:49,091
Attractive brute.

72
00:13:25,140 --> 00:13:28,496
- I'll have a champagne cocktail.
- Yes, sir.

73
00:13:28,580 --> 00:13:31,731
- Champagne cocktail, please.
- Yes, madam.

74
00:13:35,180 --> 00:13:39,173
Do you know at parties everybody
is supposed to be very happy?

75
00:13:41,740 --> 00:13:44,493
But perhaps you dislike them
as much as I do.

76
00:13:46,060 --> 00:13:48,733
Still, I think
it might have been worse.

77
00:13:48,820 --> 00:13:52,449
- Do you?
- It very nearly was much worse.

78
00:13:52,540 --> 00:13:54,610
- 0h?
- Thank you.

79
00:13:54,700 --> 00:13:58,090
We were to be treated
to a little dancing exhibition.

80
00:13:58,180 --> 00:14:00,489
But now we're to be spared
that horror.

81
00:14:00,580 --> 00:14:03,492
Mr Lermontov, I am that horror.

82
00:14:06,580 --> 00:14:07,808
Mmm...

83
00:14:09,620 --> 00:14:11,576
It's a bit late for apologies.

84
00:14:11,660 --> 00:14:13,491
Yes, a little late, I think.

85
00:14:15,260 --> 00:14:17,376
I'm sorry. I'm terribly sorry.

86
00:14:17,460 --> 00:14:20,258
But you're not sorry
I didn't dance, are you?

87
00:14:20,340 --> 00:14:23,218
- May I ask why?
- Because, my dear Miss...

88
00:14:23,300 --> 00:14:24,335
Victoria Page.

89
00:14:24,420 --> 00:14:27,218
Miss Page, if I accept
an invitation to a party,

90
00:14:27,300 --> 00:14:29,860
I do not expect to find myself
at an audition.

91
00:14:33,860 --> 00:14:36,215
Yes. You're quite right.

92
00:14:39,180 --> 00:14:42,058
Why do you want to dance?

93
00:14:44,020 --> 00:14:45,578
Why do you want to live?

94
00:14:47,420 --> 00:14:51,618
Well, I don't know exactly why,
but, uh...I must.

95
00:14:52,780 --> 00:14:54,577
That's my answer, too.

96
00:14:58,260 --> 00:14:59,409
Come with me.

97
00:14:59,500 --> 00:15:01,775
- Where to?
- We're going to talk.

98
00:15:01,860 --> 00:15:05,409
- But I don't want to talk to you.
- Don't worry. I'll do the talking.

99
00:15:19,740 --> 00:15:22,334
Can I see
Mr Lermontov now, please?

100
00:15:22,420 --> 00:15:23,694
What is it, Dimitri?

101
00:15:23,780 --> 00:15:27,250
A young man called Craster.
He's been here a hundred times.

102
00:15:27,340 --> 00:15:30,298
I've told him you're asleep.
He will not believe me.

103
00:15:30,380 --> 00:15:33,690
Either you're a bad liar
or he's a man of good sense.

104
00:15:33,780 --> 00:15:36,010
Show him in and serve breakfast.

105
00:15:39,180 --> 00:15:40,659
Mr Craster.

106
00:15:58,060 --> 00:16:00,051
What can I do for you, Mr Craster?

107
00:16:00,140 --> 00:16:02,654
I'm sorry to bother you,
Mr Lermontov,

108
00:16:02,740 --> 00:16:05,493
but it's a matter
of great importance to me.

109
00:16:05,580 --> 00:16:06,979
Yes?

110
00:16:07,060 --> 00:16:09,415
I wrote you a letter, a silly letter.

111
00:16:09,500 --> 00:16:12,014
I'd like to have it back
before you read it.

112
00:16:13,500 --> 00:16:14,853
I see.

113
00:16:18,540 --> 00:16:19,939
That's the one.

114
00:16:21,660 --> 00:16:25,175
Unfortunately, Mr Craster,
I have already read this letter.

115
00:16:25,260 --> 00:16:26,613
0h.

116
00:16:28,780 --> 00:16:32,409
- Mr Lermontov, please.
- You are Professor Palmer's pupil?.

117
00:16:32,500 --> 00:16:36,254
You say you've written a
string quartet and a piano concerto.

118
00:16:36,340 --> 00:16:37,295
Yes.

119
00:16:38,380 --> 00:16:40,132
Very interesting.

120
00:16:40,220 --> 00:16:42,529
Would you care to play me something?

121
00:16:42,620 --> 00:16:45,180
Something of your own, I mean.

122
00:16:46,260 --> 00:16:48,376
0f course, if...if you wish it.

123
00:16:59,700 --> 00:17:02,658
This is a study
I wrote for the piano.

124
00:17:06,940 --> 00:17:09,090
But I'm thinking of orchestrating it

125
00:17:09,180 --> 00:17:11,853
and putting it into an opera
I'm working on.

126
00:17:46,660 --> 00:17:50,289
But are you finished already?
It was very interesting.

127
00:17:50,380 --> 00:17:52,575
Hope I haven't ruined your breakfast.

128
00:17:53,660 --> 00:17:54,934
By the way...

129
00:17:55,020 --> 00:17:59,252
I need a new coach for the orchestra.
Would the idea interest you?

130
00:18:01,140 --> 00:18:03,017
Would it...interest?

131
00:18:03,100 --> 00:18:07,810
I shouldn't be able to pay much.
£8 a week and expenses.

132
00:18:09,780 --> 00:18:12,135
It would be absolutely marvellous.

133
00:18:12,220 --> 00:18:15,530
Get some breakfast
and come over to Covent Garden.

134
00:18:15,620 --> 00:18:17,736
Thank you.

135
00:18:17,820 --> 00:18:20,414
And your letter, Mr Craster.

136
00:18:24,060 --> 00:18:25,971
If you take my advice...

137
00:18:27,980 --> 00:18:31,097
you'll destroy it immediately
and forget about it.

138
00:18:35,420 --> 00:18:38,378
The Heart 0f Fire
is your work, isn't it?

139
00:18:40,020 --> 00:18:42,375
These things happen unintentionally.

140
00:18:42,460 --> 00:18:43,859
I know. That's why...

141
00:18:43,940 --> 00:18:48,013
That's why it is worth remembering
that it is much more disheartening

142
00:18:48,100 --> 00:18:50,056
to have to steal

143
00:18:50,140 --> 00:18:53,212
than to be stolen from, hmm?

144
00:18:56,460 --> 00:18:58,371
Good morning.

145
00:19:10,940 --> 00:19:15,252
# As I walk the long,
cloudy, stormy night... #

146
00:19:19,900 --> 00:19:24,735
# He went to Covent Garden
in the morning... #

147
00:19:24,820 --> 00:19:25,969
What a corker.

148
00:19:31,220 --> 00:19:34,656
Course I tried to get her.
Tried to get her twice. Ta-ra.

149
00:19:34,740 --> 00:19:36,935
- Here you are, son.
- Thank you.

150
00:19:37,020 --> 00:19:38,772
Hey, you'll pardon me.

151
00:19:38,860 --> 00:19:41,010
This is the way to the stage,
isn't it?

152
00:19:41,100 --> 00:19:42,931
- Name?
- Julian Craster.

153
00:19:43,020 --> 00:19:45,693
- What name?
- Julian Craster.

154
00:19:45,780 --> 00:19:46,895
Not on my list.

155
00:19:54,900 --> 00:19:57,255
- Lunch, Irina?
- Yes.

156
00:19:57,340 --> 00:19:59,058
But I have an appointment...

157
00:19:59,140 --> 00:20:02,098
I'm sorry, but I've got my job
to look after.

158
00:20:02,180 --> 00:20:05,172
- Good morning, George.
- 0h, bonjour, madame.

159
00:20:05,260 --> 00:20:06,693
How is Madame George?

160
00:20:06,780 --> 00:20:10,659
0h, she's la très jalouse.
Very jalouse.

161
00:20:10,740 --> 00:20:14,733
It's that bit of a photograph
we had took together. Cold drink?

162
00:20:14,820 --> 00:20:18,130
They been looking all over London
for you this morning.

163
00:20:18,220 --> 00:20:20,415
That's what I said.

164
00:20:20,500 --> 00:20:22,092
How much longer must I wait?

165
00:20:22,180 --> 00:20:24,535
- I'll send for the SM.
- What is your name?

166
00:20:26,020 --> 00:20:27,214
Julian Craster.

167
00:20:27,300 --> 00:20:30,212
I have an appointment
with Mr Lermontov.

168
00:20:30,300 --> 00:20:32,336
Julian Kwis...Kweiss...

169
00:20:32,420 --> 00:20:34,058
- Craster.
- Kwaster.

170
00:20:34,140 --> 00:20:37,496
Well, George, if this young man
is invited by Mr Lermontov,

171
00:20:37,580 --> 00:20:39,616
you can pass him, yes?

172
00:20:39,700 --> 00:20:43,090
Ça va by me, madame. Ça va by me.

173
00:20:43,180 --> 00:20:45,057
Follow me, young man.

174
00:20:48,580 --> 00:20:50,730
- Est-ce que vous...?
- Comment?

175
00:20:50,820 --> 00:20:51,935
Are you a dancer?

176
00:20:52,020 --> 00:20:54,978
Yes...at night.
Not very much in the morning.

177
00:20:55,060 --> 00:20:57,096
I don't know much about the ballet.

178
00:20:57,180 --> 00:21:00,729
- You are artiste?
- Yes. I'm a composer.

179
00:21:00,820 --> 00:21:03,812
Ah! And you wish to see who?

180
00:21:03,900 --> 00:21:05,936
Well, I'm afraid I'm not quite sure.

181
00:21:06,020 --> 00:21:08,853
They are all there. Take your choice.

182
00:21:17,220 --> 00:21:19,176
Excuse me. Who's in charge?

183
00:21:19,260 --> 00:21:21,933
There's five or six of them
that thinks they are.

184
00:21:22,020 --> 00:21:25,171
- Can you tell me who's in charge?
- Don't ask me.

185
00:21:25,260 --> 00:21:27,137
I'm just somebody's mother.

186
00:21:27,220 --> 00:21:30,576
That doesn't mean much around here,
I can tell you.

187
00:21:33,620 --> 00:21:37,454
- Can you tell me who's in charge?
- In charge of what?

188
00:21:37,540 --> 00:21:41,135
- Mr Lermontov asked me to come.
- Why?

189
00:21:41,220 --> 00:21:43,859
- He's engaged me.
- Not as a dancer, I hope.

190
00:21:43,940 --> 00:21:45,089
No.

191
00:21:45,180 --> 00:21:47,569
Allons, mes enfants! Au boulot!

192
00:21:48,660 --> 00:21:50,013
And...

193
00:21:53,380 --> 00:21:55,848
Well, Mr Ratov,
Mr Ljubov wants it moved.

194
00:21:55,940 --> 00:21:59,171
It is on the plan,
and there it stays.

195
00:21:59,260 --> 00:22:01,251
Well, if you say so.

196
00:22:01,340 --> 00:22:03,490
- Merci.
- Morning, madame.

197
00:22:06,980 --> 00:22:11,974
Ah, here comes the great
Boronskaja at last.

198
00:22:12,060 --> 00:22:15,336
And today she's only
43 minutes late.

199
00:22:15,420 --> 00:22:18,935
Am I supposed to congratulate
myself on that?

200
00:22:21,020 --> 00:22:23,693
I tell you, Irina,
my patience is at an end.

201
00:22:23,780 --> 00:22:26,169
I shall go to Lermontov
and explain to him

202
00:22:26,260 --> 00:22:29,650
how no theatre is big enough
to hold both you and me!

203
00:22:29,740 --> 00:22:31,537
I might as well start packing.

204
00:22:31,620 --> 00:22:35,613
0h, there's no hurry. He might choose
to dispense with MY services.

205
00:22:35,700 --> 00:22:37,133
He is quite crazy enough.

206
00:22:37,220 --> 00:22:41,179
But if we go, we go together,
Grischa, darling. Promise?

207
00:22:41,260 --> 00:22:42,659
Coo, Buschka.

208
00:22:43,740 --> 00:22:46,698
- Who are you?
- Victoria Page.

209
00:22:46,780 --> 00:22:49,419
I expect Mr Lermontov
has spoken about me.

210
00:22:49,500 --> 00:22:52,094
- He's invited me here...
- No, this is too much.

211
00:22:52,180 --> 00:22:54,694
He invites them, I teach them.

212
00:22:54,780 --> 00:22:57,214
I get rid of them, he forgets them.

213
00:22:57,300 --> 00:22:59,097
And now, unhappy girl,

214
00:22:59,180 --> 00:23:04,174
please go to the far corner of the
stage, where you'll meet five others

215
00:23:04,260 --> 00:23:09,209
to whom Mr Lermontov has also
extended his hospitality.

216
00:23:20,580 --> 00:23:22,536
Quiet, please!

217
00:23:25,540 --> 00:23:28,532
I want to rehearse the first act
of Heart 0f Fire.

218
00:23:28,620 --> 00:23:31,896
Will everybody not concerned
leave the stage, please?

219
00:23:31,980 --> 00:23:35,017
Right-o, boys,
set act one. Hurry.

220
00:23:39,100 --> 00:23:42,297
Is that so? Well, I agree.

221
00:23:44,980 --> 00:23:47,096
Where are you going, my dear?

222
00:23:47,180 --> 00:23:49,296
I'm going to talk to Mr Lermontov.

223
00:23:49,380 --> 00:23:52,816
Wouldn't it be better to wait
until after rehearsal?.

224
00:23:52,900 --> 00:23:55,460
0h, no. You see,
I know him personally.

225
00:23:55,540 --> 00:23:58,930
Ah, well, that makes
all the difference. 0f course.

226
00:23:59,020 --> 00:24:01,090
- Ratov...
- Yes, Boris?

227
00:24:01,180 --> 00:24:03,694
Stay where you are. I'll come up.

228
00:24:12,500 --> 00:24:16,015
- Good morning, Mr Lermontov.
- Good morning, Ratov.

229
00:24:16,100 --> 00:24:19,376
We must do something
about this piece.

230
00:24:19,460 --> 00:24:22,975
The girls have hardly room to move.
Ljubov was right.

231
00:24:23,060 --> 00:24:25,415
- Aha! Ljubov...
- Ljubov is always right.

232
00:24:25,500 --> 00:24:27,889
- Do you really think so?
- Yes.

233
00:24:27,980 --> 00:24:32,178
Well, well, well. Then take it away.
Take it away.

234
00:24:37,780 --> 00:24:41,739
Well, you see, my dear,
Mr Lermontov is a very busy man.

235
00:24:41,820 --> 00:24:46,177
Now, why don't you go and wait
over there with the others?

236
00:24:46,260 --> 00:24:48,455
Ivan! Are you ready?

237
00:24:48,540 --> 00:24:49,859
Yes, I will.

238
00:24:49,940 --> 00:24:52,170
- Sergei Sergeievitch?
- Yes?

239
00:24:52,260 --> 00:24:55,855
Are you acquainted with the
works or person of Julian Craster,

240
00:24:55,940 --> 00:24:57,453
composer and conductor?

241
00:24:57,540 --> 00:24:59,496
- No.
- Nor I.

242
00:24:59,580 --> 00:25:02,299
Which proves how sadly
we lag behind the times,

243
00:25:02,380 --> 00:25:04,211
for here he is in our midst.

244
00:25:04,300 --> 00:25:06,734
Lermontov has engaged him
this morning.

245
00:25:38,740 --> 00:25:40,537
Rond de jambe... E.

246
00:26:02,540 --> 00:26:03,973
Class dismissed.

247
00:26:36,060 --> 00:26:38,654
No, gentlemen. Figure 29, sing.

248
00:26:38,740 --> 00:26:42,494
I think that will do.

249
00:26:42,580 --> 00:26:44,491
Thank you, gentlemen.

250
00:26:44,580 --> 00:26:48,698
The brass could do with
your attention, Craster. Tomorrow.

251
00:27:02,860 --> 00:27:06,136
Gentlemen, I'm very sorry to bring
you here so early.

252
00:27:07,500 --> 00:27:11,015
But I've been in front
for this ballet more than once

253
00:27:11,100 --> 00:27:12,499
and I really must...

254
00:27:16,580 --> 00:27:19,458
There are one or two things
I really must put right.

255
00:27:19,540 --> 00:27:23,055
So, um, Heart 0f Fire.
0verture, please.

256
00:27:25,020 --> 00:27:26,976
From the beginning.

257
00:27:28,220 --> 00:27:32,771
0h, by the way, trumpets,
at two bars before figure two,

258
00:27:32,860 --> 00:27:35,738
have you got an E natural?.

259
00:27:35,820 --> 00:27:37,378
No. I've got an E flat.

260
00:27:37,460 --> 00:27:40,930
Ah. Makes all the difference.
Should be E natural.

261
00:27:41,020 --> 00:27:43,056
Right. From the beginning.

262
00:27:55,140 --> 00:27:57,700
I know it's hard
to get your lips set this early,

263
00:27:57,780 --> 00:28:00,089
but we ought to be able
to come in together.

264
00:28:00,180 --> 00:28:03,172
Even more pianissimo. Less strings.

265
00:28:03,260 --> 00:28:05,057
A, oboe.

266
00:28:12,020 --> 00:28:13,976
From the beginning, please.

267
00:28:41,220 --> 00:28:43,734
- That's nice.
- Mr Craster!

268
00:28:45,180 --> 00:28:50,095
What is going on?
Have you taken leave of your senses?

269
00:28:50,180 --> 00:28:54,617
Do you realise that by calling
the orchestra early we must pay them?

270
00:28:56,220 --> 00:28:58,609
And why are you rehearsing
Heart 0f Fire?

271
00:28:58,700 --> 00:29:02,249
Did I ever ask you to do that?
Tell me. I'm interested.

272
00:29:02,340 --> 00:29:05,457
I'm sure Mr Lermontov
will be interested, too.

273
00:29:07,180 --> 00:29:09,774
- Well?.
- I like it.

274
00:29:09,860 --> 00:29:14,775
You like it? You must also like the
National Anthem and the Marseillaise.

275
00:29:14,860 --> 00:29:17,693
I hope you won't summon
the full orchestra at dawn

276
00:29:17,780 --> 00:29:19,771
to practise those noble melodies?

277
00:29:21,100 --> 00:29:23,489
I leave this young man to you,
Lermontov.

278
00:29:23,580 --> 00:29:28,210
After all, he is your discovery,
not mine.

279
00:29:28,300 --> 00:29:31,337
Mr Craster, I must ask you
to exercise in future

280
00:29:31,420 --> 00:29:34,537
a little more control
over your natural ambitions.

281
00:29:34,620 --> 00:29:38,932
And why you've chosen Heart 0f Fire
for this early-morning escapade...

282
00:29:39,020 --> 00:29:40,658
Good morning, gentlemen...

283
00:29:40,740 --> 00:29:43,573
..is a mystery
I shall never hope to solve.

284
00:29:43,660 --> 00:29:46,652
May I see that wrong note
in the score, please?

285
00:29:49,580 --> 00:29:53,175
Hmm. However,
there are passages in Heart 0f Fire

286
00:29:53,260 --> 00:29:56,809
which no one need be ashamed of.

287
00:29:56,900 --> 00:29:58,652
Thank you, Mr Lermontov.

288
00:30:09,980 --> 00:30:13,097
- Good morning, Miss Page.
- Good morning, Edmund.

289
00:30:13,180 --> 00:30:15,614
- Is Lord 0ldham with you?
- Yes, miss.

290
00:30:15,700 --> 00:30:17,656
Be careful, miss.

291
00:30:19,300 --> 00:30:21,655
- Good morning, Peter.
- Hello, Vicky.

292
00:30:21,740 --> 00:30:23,890
- What are you doing here?
- What are you?

293
00:30:23,980 --> 00:30:27,734
Having lunch with Boris Lermontov,
the fellow who runs the ballet.

294
00:30:27,820 --> 00:30:30,459
- 0h. Business or pleasure?
- A bit of both.

295
00:30:30,540 --> 00:30:32,337
Are you shopping or slumming?

296
00:30:32,420 --> 00:30:36,413
Don't worry, Grischa.
I'll bring her back at three o'clock.

297
00:30:37,580 --> 00:30:40,014
- How are you, madame?
- How are you?

298
00:30:40,100 --> 00:30:43,092
Hello, Peter.
I hope we haven't kept you waiting.

299
00:30:43,180 --> 00:30:44,499
No, not at all.

300
00:30:44,580 --> 00:30:47,970
- Boris, meet my friend Vicky Page.
- How do you do?

301
00:30:50,660 --> 00:30:52,696
Can we give you a lift anywhere?

302
00:30:52,780 --> 00:30:55,419
- No, thank you, Peter.
- Excuse me, Miss Page.

303
00:30:58,500 --> 00:31:05,178
Who? Victoria Page?
yes, she may dance.

304
00:31:24,620 --> 00:31:26,656
( # Swan Lake )

305
00:33:14,460 --> 00:33:16,974
Good morning, my dear young ladies.

306
00:33:17,060 --> 00:33:19,255
I hope I find you all very well.

307
00:33:19,340 --> 00:33:22,298
There are one or two things
I would like to say.

308
00:33:22,380 --> 00:33:25,452
As you know, the ballet's
leaving Saturday for Paris.

309
00:33:25,540 --> 00:33:30,409
I can't imagine anything more
enchanting than inviting all of you,

310
00:33:30,500 --> 00:33:33,537
but I'm afraid this pleasure
must be denied me.

311
00:33:33,620 --> 00:33:36,851
To those whom we must
regretfully leave behind,

312
00:33:36,940 --> 00:33:40,694
I'd like to say just this -
please don't be discouraged.

313
00:33:40,780 --> 00:33:45,092
The fact that we can't take you
doesn't mean that you're bad dancers.

314
00:33:45,180 --> 00:33:48,058
It just means that
we haven't got enough room.

315
00:33:48,140 --> 00:33:50,529
Please step out Miss Faye,
Miss Banes,

316
00:33:50,620 --> 00:33:52,451
Miss Hardiman and Miss Laughlin.

317
00:33:57,540 --> 00:33:59,098
Yes.

318
00:33:59,180 --> 00:34:02,934
I thank you four ladies for
the hard work you've done this year.

319
00:34:03,020 --> 00:34:06,410
- Mr Ljubov echoes my gratitude.
- Mmmm.

320
00:34:06,500 --> 00:34:10,095
Maybe next year, we shall
meet you again. Good morning.

321
00:34:10,180 --> 00:34:12,375
Vicky, he means us!

322
00:35:45,580 --> 00:35:49,778
Listen... Mes amis...

323
00:35:50,540 --> 00:35:53,452
I am fiancée. I get married!

324
00:35:54,980 --> 00:35:57,016
My dear child!

325
00:35:57,100 --> 00:36:01,059
All my love and best wishes
for your happiness.

326
00:36:07,780 --> 00:36:12,570
I wish you the greatest happiness
with your new partner.

327
00:36:12,660 --> 00:36:16,050
- Merci. Grischa? Where is Grischa?
- I'm here, Irina!

328
00:36:16,140 --> 00:36:17,732
Darling, do you hate me?

329
00:36:17,820 --> 00:36:22,336
I could never hate you, Irina,
but how can I ever forgive you?

330
00:36:22,420 --> 00:36:24,456
You will forgive me, that I know.

331
00:36:24,540 --> 00:36:27,577
Don't quarrel with your husband
as much as me.

332
00:36:27,660 --> 00:36:31,289
Where is Boris Lermontov?
He has nothing to say to me?

333
00:36:33,140 --> 00:36:34,698
Boris!

334
00:36:38,140 --> 00:36:41,769
He has...no heart, that man.

335
00:37:19,460 --> 00:37:20,609
Entrez!

336
00:37:22,740 --> 00:37:26,938
- Mr Craster, I have a job for you.
- Good!

337
00:37:27,020 --> 00:37:31,616
Do I understand you have not been
altogether very happy with us so far?

338
00:37:31,700 --> 00:37:34,168
- Well, I...
- Well, what?

339
00:37:34,260 --> 00:37:38,458
Coaching an orchestra is not exactly
a young composer's dream, is it?

340
00:37:38,540 --> 00:37:43,170
I'm afraid the job I have may not be
a young composer's dream, either.

341
00:37:43,260 --> 00:37:48,015
Still, I hope you do not consider it
entirely unworthy of your talent.

342
00:37:52,380 --> 00:37:57,170
The ballet of The Red Shoes is from
a fairy tale by Hans Andersen...

343
00:38:02,180 --> 00:38:04,535
..pair of red shoes.

344
00:38:07,540 --> 00:38:08,973
0h, I beg your pardon?

345
00:38:10,580 --> 00:38:15,813
The ballet of The Red Shoes is from
a fairy tale by Hans Andersen.

346
00:38:15,900 --> 00:38:19,779
It is the story of a girl
who is devoured by an ambition

347
00:38:19,860 --> 00:38:22,693
to attend a dance
in a pair of red shoes.

348
00:38:22,780 --> 00:38:25,089
She gets the shoes, goes to the dance

349
00:38:25,180 --> 00:38:27,250
and at first, she's very happy.

350
00:38:28,820 --> 00:38:33,769
At the end of the evening,
she gets tired and wants to go home.

351
00:38:35,860 --> 00:38:39,136
But the red shoes...

352
00:38:39,220 --> 00:38:41,529
are not tired.

353
00:38:41,620 --> 00:38:44,578
In fact, the red shoes
are never tired.

354
00:38:44,660 --> 00:38:49,814
They dance her out into the streets,
over the mountains and valleys,

355
00:38:49,900 --> 00:38:53,415
through fields and forests,
through night and day.

356
00:38:56,420 --> 00:38:59,412
Time rushes by. Love rushes by.

357
00:39:00,860 --> 00:39:02,816
Life rushes by.

358
00:39:04,300 --> 00:39:07,337
But the red shoes...dance on.

359
00:39:07,420 --> 00:39:09,650
What happens in the end?

360
00:39:09,740 --> 00:39:12,413
- In the end, she dies.
- Yes. I remember.

361
00:39:12,500 --> 00:39:14,377
The music is by Felipe Beltran.

362
00:39:14,460 --> 00:39:18,055
He did it for us last year
during our South American tour.

363
00:39:18,140 --> 00:39:22,258
You'll find some passages marked with
a blue pencil. They are bad.

364
00:39:22,340 --> 00:39:26,856
I would like to see what you can do
in the way of a little rewriting.

365
00:39:26,940 --> 00:39:29,534
- 0h.
- You can take your time.

366
00:39:29,620 --> 00:39:31,497
- There's no hurry.
- Thank you.

367
00:39:31,580 --> 00:39:33,730
- 0n vous attend.

368
00:39:33,820 --> 00:39:35,890
0ui, je viens.

369
00:39:35,980 --> 00:39:37,333
Thank you.

370
00:40:20,900 --> 00:40:25,416
Ah, look at our Boronskaja.
She's in wonderful form tonight.

371
00:40:25,500 --> 00:40:28,697
I'm not interested in Boronskaja's
form any more.

372
00:40:28,780 --> 00:40:32,329
Nor with any prima ballerina
imbecile enough to get married.

373
00:40:32,420 --> 00:40:35,776
- 0h, come now, Boris.
- She's out. Finished.

374
00:40:41,420 --> 00:40:43,888
You cannot have it both ways.

375
00:40:43,980 --> 00:40:47,814
The dancer who relies upon the
doubtful comforts of human love...

376
00:40:48,500 --> 00:40:51,333
will never be a great dancer.

377
00:40:51,420 --> 00:40:52,819
Never!

378
00:41:02,620 --> 00:41:07,250
That is all very pure and fine,
but you can't alter human nature.

379
00:41:07,340 --> 00:41:10,537
No? I think you can do
even better than that.

380
00:41:10,620 --> 00:41:11,939
You can ignore it.

381
00:41:38,580 --> 00:41:40,571
Boris!

382
00:41:40,660 --> 00:41:42,093
Adieu.

383
00:41:45,300 --> 00:41:46,858
Well, Irina,

384
00:41:46,940 --> 00:41:50,535
now you'll be able to sleep
as long as you like

385
00:41:50,620 --> 00:41:55,250
and eat sweets all day
and go to parties every night.

386
00:41:55,340 --> 00:41:58,457
And you, now you will be calm.

387
00:41:58,540 --> 00:42:00,371
The class will start on time.

388
00:42:00,460 --> 00:42:04,817
No more shouting. No more
hysteria backstage. No more...

389
00:42:04,900 --> 00:42:06,811
No more...Irina.

390
00:42:29,860 --> 00:42:31,851
0h, Monsieur Lermontov!

391
00:42:43,260 --> 00:42:44,454
Miss Page.

392
00:42:47,020 --> 00:42:50,774
- Are you very tired?
- Yes, thank you.

393
00:42:50,860 --> 00:42:52,452
I mean, I'm not very tired.

394
00:42:52,540 --> 00:42:55,293
Monsieur, je vous présente
Miss Victoria Page.

395
00:42:55,380 --> 00:42:58,929
Monsieur Boudin,
le directeur général de l'opéra.

396
00:42:59,020 --> 00:43:02,615
- Monsieur Rideaut.
- Enchanté, mademoiselle.

397
00:43:02,700 --> 00:43:07,057
You have already visited Monte Carlo,
mademoiselle?

398
00:43:07,140 --> 00:43:08,858
Yes, I was here last season.

399
00:43:08,940 --> 00:43:13,218
- Then you know the Hôtel de Paris.
- Yes, but I believe I'm staying...

400
00:43:13,300 --> 00:43:16,372
Hôtel de Paris.
You'll be very comfortable.

401
00:43:30,940 --> 00:43:34,649
La voiture de Monsieur Lermontov
vous attend, Miss Page.

402
00:43:41,780 --> 00:43:43,532
Bon soir, mademoiselle.

403
00:44:46,300 --> 00:44:48,052
Montez, mademoiselle.

404
00:46:00,860 --> 00:46:03,772
You look dressed up
for a conference.

405
00:46:03,860 --> 00:46:05,930
Hello. Is there a conference on?

406
00:46:06,020 --> 00:46:08,978
Yes. They're all arguing.
I've been here since seven.

407
00:46:09,980 --> 00:46:11,538
There you are, Miss Page.

408
00:46:11,620 --> 00:46:13,372
Will you come in here, please?

409
00:46:23,460 --> 00:46:27,419
I was just going out, Mr Lermontov,
when I got your message.

410
00:46:36,420 --> 00:46:37,933
Miss Page...

411
00:46:39,060 --> 00:46:43,611
I've asked you to come here tonight
because we're preparing a new ballet,

412
00:46:44,860 --> 00:46:47,010
and I've decided
to give you a chance

413
00:46:47,100 --> 00:46:50,012
and let you dance
the principal part in it.

414
00:46:50,100 --> 00:46:53,410
But there's one thing
I must tell you at once.

415
00:46:53,500 --> 00:46:57,778
My belief in your possibilities
is not shared by my colleagues here.

416
00:47:00,780 --> 00:47:04,011
However, it is hardly
necessary for me to add

417
00:47:04,100 --> 00:47:06,614
that whatever their personal belief,

418
00:47:06,700 --> 00:47:08,895
they will all give you their best.

419
00:47:08,980 --> 00:47:11,574
The rest, of course, is up to you.

420
00:47:12,660 --> 00:47:14,890
Well, Miss Page...that's all.

421
00:47:15,980 --> 00:47:18,733
We shall start work
early tomorrow morning.

422
00:47:18,820 --> 00:47:22,529
I suggest you forget all about
your party and go home to bed.

423
00:47:23,500 --> 00:47:25,252
Yes, I will.

424
00:47:29,820 --> 00:47:31,776
And Miss Page?

425
00:47:34,020 --> 00:47:36,659
- Good luck.
- Thank you.

426
00:47:41,740 --> 00:47:43,537
Well, what happened?

427
00:47:44,700 --> 00:47:47,976
- I've got a part in a new ballet.
- New? What ballet?

428
00:47:49,300 --> 00:47:51,530
The Red Shoes!

429
00:47:54,460 --> 00:47:56,576
Now, listen to this. It's impossible.

430
00:47:57,660 --> 00:48:00,936
Well, I couldn't rewrite
that bit, could I?

431
00:48:01,020 --> 00:48:03,454
- Why not?
- You didn't blue-pencil it.

432
00:48:03,540 --> 00:48:06,213
Horrors like that
speak for themselves.

433
00:48:06,300 --> 00:48:08,734
In fact, I had some ideas about that.

434
00:48:08,820 --> 00:48:11,493
Where are they, dear fellow?
We need a score!

435
00:48:11,580 --> 00:48:13,457
If you'll allow me.

436
00:48:17,340 --> 00:48:19,137
Well, it's the church scene.

437
00:48:19,220 --> 00:48:23,338
Get rid of this sentimental hymn
and take a four-square chorale.

438
00:48:23,420 --> 00:48:25,172
Something like this.

439
00:48:32,300 --> 00:48:36,259
Then I thought all the way through,
a church bell coming in.

440
00:48:45,980 --> 00:48:48,858
All this on the strings.

441
00:48:52,500 --> 00:48:54,809
Then as the priest appears,
the brass.

442
00:49:02,860 --> 00:49:05,693
Shall I play you
The Dance of the Red Shoes?

443
00:49:11,900 --> 00:49:14,494
Thank you, Mr Craster. Thank you.

444
00:49:18,260 --> 00:49:21,616
I want you to change everything.
I want a new score.

445
00:49:23,260 --> 00:49:25,251
There you are, Mr Lermontov.

446
00:49:26,140 --> 00:49:28,370
And where's the orchestration?

447
00:49:28,460 --> 00:49:30,769
- When do you want it?
- Yesterday.

448
00:49:30,860 --> 00:49:32,930
You wanted to work. Go home and work.

449
00:49:33,020 --> 00:49:35,375
I don't want to see you
till it's done.

450
00:49:35,460 --> 00:49:37,291
You won't!

451
00:50:00,340 --> 00:50:02,331
Why aren't you in bed?

452
00:50:02,420 --> 00:50:05,810
- 0h, you gave me quite a fright.
- I meant to.

453
00:50:09,740 --> 00:50:11,970
Why aren't you in bed?

454
00:50:12,060 --> 00:50:15,769
I was much too excited to sleep,
so here I am.

455
00:50:15,860 --> 00:50:18,374
- Are you? I haven't seen you.
- Thank you.

456
00:50:18,460 --> 00:50:20,769
By the way,
you haven't seen me, either.

457
00:50:20,860 --> 00:50:24,216
- Has he sent you to bed, too?
- No.

458
00:50:24,300 --> 00:50:28,373
I'm just working on the score
of my new ballet, The Red Shoes.

459
00:50:28,460 --> 00:50:30,212
Is that my ballet, too?

460
00:50:31,300 --> 00:50:32,858
Yes, I suppose it is.

461
00:50:48,740 --> 00:50:51,891
I wonder what it feels like
to wake up in the morning

462
00:50:51,980 --> 00:50:53,459
and find oneself famous.

463
00:50:53,540 --> 00:50:57,294
You're not likely to know
if you stay here talking much longer.

464
00:50:57,380 --> 00:51:00,929
- So, good luck.
- Good luck.

465
00:51:50,060 --> 00:51:52,096
She's putting too much into it.

466
00:51:52,180 --> 00:51:54,330
Why don't you tell her, Grischa?

467
00:51:54,420 --> 00:51:56,092
Mind your own business.

468
00:51:57,180 --> 00:52:00,809
She has the dance with me and
the dance at the fair earlier.

469
00:52:00,900 --> 00:52:04,939
And the big stuff coming up.
She can't dance everything full out.

470
00:52:05,020 --> 00:52:08,569
- She ought to know that.
- How do you expect her to know it,

471
00:52:08,660 --> 00:52:11,732
if you never danced full out
before opening night?

472
00:52:17,860 --> 00:52:20,772
Here are the designs
for the costumes, Boris.

473
00:52:20,860 --> 00:52:23,374
One moment.
Sit down, will you, please?

474
00:52:26,500 --> 00:52:30,129
I'm so sorry. Something
has to be done about the music.

475
00:52:30,220 --> 00:52:32,290
She starts the pirouette early.

476
00:52:32,380 --> 00:52:36,214
- The tempo's wrong. It's too fast.
- It's the right tempo.

477
00:52:36,300 --> 00:52:38,860
0f course. 0nce more.

478
00:52:45,300 --> 00:52:49,134
- She'll be all right.
- I hope so.

479
00:52:49,220 --> 00:52:51,211
Still unconverted, Sergei?

480
00:52:51,300 --> 00:52:55,009
Well, of course
she's a charming girl, but...

481
00:52:55,100 --> 00:52:57,295
I know nothing about her charms.

482
00:52:57,380 --> 00:53:01,373
But they won't wait till the end,
they'll applaud in the middle!

483
00:53:02,340 --> 00:53:05,412
- Come now.
- Sergei, I'll take a bet.

484
00:53:05,500 --> 00:53:07,058
0h, enough. Enough.

485
00:53:09,060 --> 00:53:13,611
Miss Page, we are trying to create
something of beauty.

486
00:53:13,700 --> 00:53:16,612
While you wave your arms
like a scarecrow

487
00:53:16,700 --> 00:53:19,294
and bend your knees
like an old cart horse,

488
00:53:19,380 --> 00:53:21,211
we are unlikely to succeed.

489
00:53:25,220 --> 00:53:27,734
Well, well...it's a bet.

490
00:53:28,780 --> 00:53:30,930
Come, let me see your sketches.

491
00:53:33,140 --> 00:53:34,892
The girl.

492
00:54:11,820 --> 00:54:14,050
You still think I can do it?

493
00:54:14,140 --> 00:54:17,974
Well, at the moment, you look as if
you find it difficult.

494
00:54:18,060 --> 00:54:21,894
But when we open in two weeks,
I hope it'll be supremely simple.

495
00:54:24,020 --> 00:54:26,898
Don't forget,
the great impression of simplicity

496
00:54:26,980 --> 00:54:30,450
can only be achieved by a great agony
of body and spirit.

497
00:54:30,540 --> 00:54:33,737
Voilà.

498
00:54:33,820 --> 00:54:36,892
You don't want to ruin
your breathing, do you?

499
00:54:38,380 --> 00:54:40,974
From today,
you'll lunch in my office.

500
00:54:41,060 --> 00:54:42,413
Craster.

501
00:54:49,180 --> 00:54:51,410
Will you sit over there, please?

502
00:54:51,500 --> 00:54:53,536
Merci. Mr Craster, the piano.

503
00:54:53,620 --> 00:54:56,930
Do you usually have musical
accompaniment to your meals?

504
00:54:57,020 --> 00:54:58,499
No, Miss Page, I do not.

505
00:54:58,580 --> 00:55:01,890
I'm afraid this is your fate
for the next two weeks.

506
00:55:01,980 --> 00:55:05,052
Mr Craster is going to play
The Red Shoes music

507
00:55:05,140 --> 00:55:08,689
at every lunch, tea and dinner
you take until we open.

508
00:55:08,780 --> 00:55:10,498
I see.

509
00:55:10,580 --> 00:55:15,256
Yes. In this way, you should become
quite familiar with the music.

510
00:55:15,340 --> 00:55:17,331
Yes, I think I probably shall.

511
00:55:17,420 --> 00:55:20,776
The music is all that matters.
Nothing but the music.

512
00:55:20,860 --> 00:55:22,691
- Mr Craster.
- Certainly.

513
00:55:22,780 --> 00:55:24,577
Bon appétit.

514
00:55:28,060 --> 00:55:30,210
à votre service, mademoiselle.

515
00:55:33,300 --> 00:55:37,259
Some composers specialise in
lunchtime music, don't they?

516
00:55:37,340 --> 00:55:41,174
- Some.
- You?

517
00:55:41,260 --> 00:55:42,773
In my time.

518
00:55:49,500 --> 00:55:51,650
Do you mind not playing that?

519
00:55:53,300 --> 00:55:54,699
It's the right tempo.

520
00:55:56,060 --> 00:55:58,096
Let's take the ballroom scene.

521
00:55:58,180 --> 00:56:01,377
That's the most digestible
part of the score.

522
00:56:01,460 --> 00:56:03,257
The ballroom's been cut.

523
00:56:03,340 --> 00:56:08,698
Cut as a scene, but it's still there
in my score.

524
00:56:08,780 --> 00:56:10,850
I wrote this dance for a ballroom.

525
00:56:10,940 --> 00:56:15,491
Anyone who understands anything
about music will see a ballroom.

526
00:56:23,300 --> 00:56:26,133
Even Lermontov will see a ballroom.

527
00:56:26,220 --> 00:56:27,573
Even you.

528
00:56:28,660 --> 00:56:32,096
And when you're lifted
into the air by your partner,

529
00:56:32,180 --> 00:56:34,057
my music will transform you.

530
00:56:34,140 --> 00:56:35,539
Into what?

531
00:56:37,700 --> 00:56:40,498
A flower...swaying in the wind.

532
00:56:42,300 --> 00:56:44,689
A cloud...drifting in the sky.

533
00:56:45,780 --> 00:56:48,169
A white bird...flying.

534
00:56:48,260 --> 00:56:49,773
Tell that to Ratov.

535
00:56:50,860 --> 00:56:53,454
He would love
your birds and flowers.

536
00:56:53,540 --> 00:56:54,689
You don't?

537
00:56:54,780 --> 00:56:58,250
- If you were a dancer, you'd know...
- Just a minute.

538
00:56:58,340 --> 00:57:00,900
# Nothing matters but the music #

539
00:57:00,980 --> 00:57:03,699
It's hard enough
to get off the ground anyway

540
00:57:03,780 --> 00:57:05,657
without being a bird or flower.

541
00:57:09,980 --> 00:57:12,813
Won't you imagine anything
on the first night?

542
00:57:15,940 --> 00:57:18,738
Yes, a wall between me
and the audience.

543
00:57:30,500 --> 00:57:32,809
My music will pull you through it.

544
00:58:04,380 --> 00:58:06,575
Hee-haw!

545
00:58:06,660 --> 00:58:09,891
Miss Page, I'm not a circus conductor
and you're not a horse.

546
00:58:09,980 --> 00:58:11,049
It's too fast.

547
00:58:12,940 --> 00:58:15,215
You would not find it too fast

548
00:58:15,300 --> 00:58:19,134
if you'd let the slow passage end
before you start your pirouette.

549
00:58:19,220 --> 00:58:21,734
My downbeat marks a pause.

550
00:58:21,820 --> 00:58:24,129
We understand it,
don't we, gentlemen?

551
00:58:24,220 --> 00:58:27,769
- You come in on the second beat.
- Impossible!

552
00:58:27,860 --> 00:58:29,896
0ne, two, tia, tia!

553
00:58:29,980 --> 00:58:32,653
It's quite simple.
You see this baton?

554
00:58:32,740 --> 00:58:35,208
- Yes.
- Well, follow it!

555
00:59:14,820 --> 00:59:16,378
- Good luck.
- Good luck.

556
00:59:18,540 --> 00:59:20,417
Vicky. Vicky!

557
00:59:20,500 --> 00:59:22,968
Dance whatever tempo you like.
I'll follow you.

558
00:59:27,060 --> 00:59:28,812
All right, Ivan?

559
00:59:28,900 --> 00:59:30,413
Time to go down, Craster.

560
00:59:30,500 --> 00:59:32,172
- Good luck.
- Thank you.

561
00:59:32,260 --> 00:59:34,615
- Nervous?
- No.

562
00:59:43,980 --> 00:59:45,971
Do I...?

563
00:59:46,060 --> 00:59:47,971
What the devil have you
got to worry about?

564
00:59:48,060 --> 00:59:52,212
It's a fine score.
A magnificent score. I only wish I...

565
00:59:52,300 --> 00:59:54,211
Go on.

566
01:00:32,020 --> 01:00:35,535
- Grischa.
- It's chaos, chaos, chaos!

567
01:00:35,620 --> 01:00:38,339
- Grischa...
- Ah, Boris.

568
01:00:39,700 --> 01:00:41,975
- Mon dieu! The red shoes.
- What?

569
01:00:42,060 --> 01:00:44,938
The red shoes are not there!

570
01:00:45,020 --> 01:00:46,851
- Rideaut.
- Monsieur.

571
01:00:48,660 --> 01:00:49,809
Where are they?

572
01:00:49,900 --> 01:00:53,176
- You haven't hidden them yourself?
- No, no, no!

573
01:00:53,260 --> 01:00:55,490
Yes! Fou! Fou!

574
01:01:04,700 --> 01:01:06,770
Boris, look here.

575
01:01:06,860 --> 01:01:08,452
Elephants.

576
01:01:08,540 --> 01:01:11,338
Clumsy elephants
have ruined my decor.

577
01:01:11,420 --> 01:01:14,696
- Calm yourself.
- The door! The door! It won't shut.

578
01:01:14,780 --> 01:01:17,055
- Somebody must hold it.
- But who?

579
01:01:17,140 --> 01:01:19,973
The call boy.
He'll have nothing to do.

580
01:01:20,060 --> 01:01:24,133
- Dimitri.
- Give it to me. Hold the door.

581
01:01:24,220 --> 01:01:28,008
- Best of luck, Miss Page.
- I can't remember my entrance.

582
01:01:28,100 --> 01:01:31,695
You think you can't.
What about this?

583
01:01:32,780 --> 01:01:35,248
That's it. It's all right
when I hear the music.

584
01:01:35,340 --> 01:01:38,013
Since you undoubtedly
will hear the music,

585
01:01:38,100 --> 01:01:40,614
it's undoubtedly
going to be all right.

586
01:01:40,700 --> 01:01:44,170
The music is all that matters.
Nothing but the music.

587
01:01:44,260 --> 01:01:47,138
If I had any doubts
about you, I'd be nervous.

588
01:01:47,220 --> 01:01:48,972
- Am I nervous?
- No.

589
01:01:49,060 --> 01:01:51,255
You're not dancing for an audience.

590
01:01:51,340 --> 01:01:53,934
You're dancing for
Ljubov, Ratov, myself,

591
01:01:54,020 --> 01:01:56,659
people you've danced for
many times before.

592
01:01:56,740 --> 01:01:59,538
I believed in you
from the very beginning.

593
01:01:59,620 --> 01:02:02,009
But now everybody does.

594
01:02:02,100 --> 01:02:08,050
Dance tonight with the same ecstasy
I've seen in you only once before.

595
01:02:08,140 --> 01:02:09,573
At the Mercury Theatre?

596
01:02:10,820 --> 01:02:13,414
Yes, at the Mercury Theatre
in London...

597
01:02:13,500 --> 01:02:15,297
on a wet Saturday afternoon.

598
01:02:15,380 --> 01:02:17,177
- 40 seconds.
- Coming.

599
01:02:20,060 --> 01:02:21,334
Good luck, my dear.

600
01:02:21,420 --> 01:02:25,811
You're the magician, to have produced
this in three weeks from nothing.

601
01:02:25,900 --> 01:02:28,414
A magician can't produce
a rabbit from a hat

602
01:02:28,500 --> 01:02:30,968
if there isn't already
a rabbit in the hat.

603
01:02:51,100 --> 01:02:54,297
It's a pity the theatre
only holds 300.

604
01:02:54,380 --> 01:02:57,497
We could have filled
the Albert Hall tonight!

605
01:02:57,580 --> 01:03:01,414
But what we're creating tonight,
the world will talk of tomorrow.

606
01:03:04,860 --> 01:03:06,213
Good boy.

607
01:03:07,380 --> 01:03:08,654
Rideau.

608
01:19:51,420 --> 01:19:54,139
Ça va? Any swelling?

609
01:19:54,220 --> 01:19:55,858
I mean the head.

610
01:19:55,940 --> 01:19:58,579
All that clapping, bravos, roses...

611
01:19:58,660 --> 01:20:00,298
Puh! All that's nothing.

612
01:20:00,380 --> 01:20:04,498
But when I,
who have seen Pavlova dance,

613
01:20:04,580 --> 01:20:07,333
tell you that last night
you were not bad...

614
01:20:07,420 --> 01:20:09,456
not good, but not bad...

615
01:20:09,540 --> 01:20:11,531
that's something.

616
01:20:14,660 --> 01:20:16,252
Now I tell you truth.

617
01:20:16,340 --> 01:20:18,331
It was...

618
01:20:18,420 --> 01:20:20,615
- good.
- Thank you, Mr Ljubov.

619
01:20:20,700 --> 01:20:23,817
- My name is Grischa.
- Mine is Vicky.

620
01:20:23,900 --> 01:20:26,460
How do you do?

621
01:20:26,540 --> 01:20:29,418
Arm straighter. So...

622
01:20:29,500 --> 01:20:31,616
Boris Lermontov wants to see you.

623
01:20:31,700 --> 01:20:33,930
Why in the class time? Why?

624
01:21:03,424 --> 01:21:05,335
Silence!

625

- Fifth.
- Bras.

626
01:21:11,344 --> 01:21:13,983
Hello? Hello? Yes.
Who is it? 0h, it's you!

627
01:21:14,064 --> 01:21:15,941
Monsieur Lermontov...

628
01:21:16,024 --> 01:21:18,857
No, no. It's fine.
Thank you for ringing me.

629
01:21:18,944 --> 01:21:21,174
You're not disturbing me at all.

630
01:21:21,264 --> 01:21:24,017
I always have time
for congratulations.

631
01:21:27,664 --> 01:21:30,656
- 0h, yes. I agree.
- Monsieur Lermontov...

632
01:21:30,744 --> 01:21:34,259
A most distinguished score.

633
01:21:34,344 --> 01:21:38,053
- Voilà, Monsieur Craster.
- Uh, Monsieur Craster?

634
01:21:38,144 --> 01:21:41,022
Yes.
0f course he'll contact me.

635
01:21:41,104 --> 01:21:42,457
Yes, he's going to.

636
01:21:42,544 --> 01:21:46,014
He's starting with a new ballet,
full of gait and charm.

637
01:21:46,104 --> 01:21:48,572
La Belle Meunière,
book by Marcel Lucien.

638
01:21:48,664 --> 01:21:49,892
Go away.

639
01:21:49,984 --> 01:21:52,942
Yes. 0h, yes,
it's a wonderful role for her.

640
01:21:53,024 --> 01:21:55,822
- Au revoir, Lermontov.
- Au revoir, madame.

641
01:21:55,904 --> 01:21:57,735
No, not this season. Next season.

642
01:22:00,784 --> 01:22:02,058
Merci beaucoup.

643
01:22:02,144 --> 01:22:04,612
Yes. It was very kind
of you to ring me.

644
01:22:04,704 --> 01:22:06,023
Thank you very much.

645
01:22:06,104 --> 01:22:08,857
No more calls,
not even congratulations.

646
01:22:11,184 --> 01:22:13,459
Au revoir. Where are those papers?

647
01:22:13,544 --> 01:22:15,262
Thank you very much. Here.

648
01:22:17,264 --> 01:22:18,743
Excusez-moi.

649
01:22:18,824 --> 01:22:21,782
Well, Mr Craster, that's all.
I'm proud of you.

650
01:22:21,864 --> 01:22:25,823
- Mr Lermontov, I would like to...
- Some other time...ah, yes!

651
01:22:25,904 --> 01:22:27,576
- Do you read French?
- Yes.

652
01:22:27,664 --> 01:22:31,100
Well, read it.
We'll talk about it some other time.

653
01:22:33,424 --> 01:22:35,301
Mademoiselle Page.

654
01:22:35,384 --> 01:22:39,172
Come in, Miss Page, come in.
Sit down.

655
01:22:39,264 --> 01:22:42,301
I want to talk to you
about your future.

656
01:22:44,704 --> 01:22:45,978
When we first met,

657
01:22:46,064 --> 01:22:50,103
you asked me a question to which
I gave a stupid answer.

658
01:22:50,184 --> 01:22:53,494
You asked me whether
I wanted to live and I said yes.

659
01:22:53,584 --> 01:22:56,257
Actually, I want more, much more!

660
01:22:56,344 --> 01:22:57,493
I want to create,

661
01:22:57,584 --> 01:23:01,020
to make something big
out of something little...

662
01:23:01,104 --> 01:23:04,096
to make a great dancer out of you.

663
01:23:04,184 --> 01:23:07,256
But first, I must ask you
the same question.

664
01:23:07,344 --> 01:23:09,175
What do you want from life?

665
01:23:10,264 --> 01:23:11,777
- To live?
- To dance.

666
01:23:19,184 --> 01:23:22,494
We have two months left of the season
in Monte Carlo.

667
01:23:22,584 --> 01:23:25,178
Not much time,
but enough, two months.

668
01:23:25,264 --> 01:23:29,815
Then we go on tour - Rome, Vienna,
Copenhagen, Stuttgart, then America.

669
01:23:29,904 --> 01:23:31,940
Then next year, London again.

670
01:23:32,024 --> 01:23:34,015
All the big parts for you...

671
01:23:34,104 --> 01:23:38,143
Coppelia, Lac des Cygnes, Gisèle,
Les Sylphides, La Boutique...

672
01:23:38,224 --> 01:23:39,942
We create them all first with you.

673
01:23:40,024 --> 01:23:41,901
You shall dance...

674
01:23:41,984 --> 01:23:43,622
and the world shall follow.

675
01:23:43,704 --> 01:23:45,695
You... Shh!

676
01:23:45,784 --> 01:23:47,854
Not a word.

677
01:23:47,944 --> 01:23:50,378
I will do the talking.

678
01:23:50,464 --> 01:23:52,694
You...

679
01:23:52,784 --> 01:23:54,422
will do the dancing.

680

( # La Boutique Fantasque )

681
01:24:19,064 --> 01:24:20,622
Ah, Victoria Page.

682
01:24:23,824 --> 01:24:26,213
- Good night, Boris.
- Night, Grischa.

683
01:24:26,304 --> 01:24:28,898
- She was not bad tonight.
- She'll be all right.

684
01:24:28,984 --> 01:24:33,375
All right! Not bad!
But she's a flame!

685
01:24:35,144 --> 01:24:39,023
- Still la-di-da? Good night, Boris.
- Good night, Sergei.

686
01:24:39,104 --> 01:24:45,703
Vicky was wonderful in Boutique,
just a little Dresden shepherdess.

687
01:24:45,784 --> 01:24:48,139
We should reconstruct the theatre.

688
01:24:48,224 --> 01:24:50,738
- What's wrong with it?
- It's too small!

689
01:24:50,824 --> 01:24:53,497
- Good night, Lermontov.
- Good night, Livy.

690
01:24:53,584 --> 01:24:56,781
- Her timing's a miracle.
- Keep her up to it.

- Good night, Grischa.

693

- Good night, Boris.
- Good night, Sergei.

694
01:26:01,784 --> 01:26:04,935
- Good night, Mr Lermontov.
- Good night, Vicky.

695

- Good night, Boris.
- Good night, Sergei.

696
01:27:02,264 --> 01:27:05,062
Uh, thank you,
Monsieur Boudin. That's all.

697
01:27:06,144 --> 01:27:08,612
- Good night, Boris.
- Good night, Grischa.

698

- Boudin.
- 0ui?

699

Which is the very best restaurant
on the coast?

700
01:27:13,784 --> 01:27:15,820
- La Resserre.
- 0ui, La Resserre.

701
01:27:15,904 --> 01:27:18,896
- Good night, Lermontov.
- Good night, Livy.

702
01:27:19,944 --> 01:27:21,775
Book me a table.

703
01:27:24,024 --> 01:27:27,380
- For...two?
- Yes.

704
01:27:29,504 --> 01:27:31,096
Au revoir.

705
01:27:31,184 --> 01:27:32,822
- Julian.
- Yes?

706
01:27:32,904 --> 01:27:35,213
I never said good night to Lermontov.

707
01:27:35,304 --> 01:27:39,058
Monsieur Dimitri?
No, Miss Page has still not come in.

708
01:27:39,144 --> 01:27:42,500
Monsieur Ratov? Uh, not yet, either.

709
01:27:42,584 --> 01:27:45,781
Monsieur Ljubov? 317... No.

710
01:27:48,064 --> 01:27:50,624
Ah, Monsieur Dimitri, I've just heard

711
01:27:50,704 --> 01:27:54,982
they've all gone to supper
at the 0ld Port with Monsieur Ljubov.

712
01:27:55,064 --> 01:27:56,463
His birthday!

Class! Class! Un gateau.

714
01:28:58,944 --> 01:29:00,616
Ah, merci.

Boris Lermontov!

716
01:29:13,744 --> 01:29:15,416
Greetings, Grischa.

717
01:29:15,504 --> 01:29:17,381
Am I permitted
to join your party?

718
01:29:17,464 --> 01:29:20,661
Get me a chair!
What a pleasure, Boris.

719
01:29:20,744 --> 01:29:22,621
A chair for Boris Lermontov!

720
01:29:22,704 --> 01:29:26,856
Two chairs for Boris Lermontov!
Make way there. A throne.

721
01:29:26,944 --> 01:29:29,299
A throne for the great Boris.
Take mine.

722
01:29:29,384 --> 01:29:30,658
No, no, take mine.

723
01:29:30,744 --> 01:29:33,258
No, you sit down.
It's your birthday.

724
01:29:34,344 --> 01:29:35,493
Well...

725
01:29:35,584 --> 01:29:39,736
seems a long time since I sat down
to supper with my entire family.

726
01:29:52,704 --> 01:29:57,653
But it appears that the great
Miss Page is not with us tonight.

727
01:29:57,744 --> 01:30:01,623
Don't you miss another member
of our happy little family?

728
01:30:03,744 --> 01:30:06,383
No...no. I can't say I do.

729
01:30:06,464 --> 01:30:10,662
Why should you? You're a busy man.
Have a drink, Lermontov!

730
01:30:12,704 --> 01:30:15,138
Grischa. Ta santé.

731
01:30:15,224 --> 01:30:18,773
0f course we all know
you're a busy man, Boris Lermontov,

732
01:30:18,864 --> 01:30:21,822
but do you mean to tell me
you have noticed nothing?

733
01:30:21,904 --> 01:30:24,464
Don't exaggerate.

734
01:30:24,544 --> 01:30:27,934
Boris, we have a little romance
in our midst.

735
01:30:28,024 --> 01:30:29,503
A great romance!

736
01:30:29,584 --> 01:30:33,782
- Romeo Craster.
- And Juliet...Page.

737
01:30:35,944 --> 01:30:39,334
And when...
did this great romance begin?

738
01:30:39,424 --> 01:30:41,892
With the Red Shoes.

739
01:30:44,304 --> 01:30:46,135
Charming.

740
01:30:46,224 --> 01:30:49,136
And where have they
taken themselves tonight?

741
01:30:49,224 --> 01:30:52,773
What does it matter
where they've gone?

742
01:30:52,864 --> 01:30:57,096
They are young, they are together
and they are in love.

743
01:31:27,144 --> 01:31:29,977
Darling.

744
01:31:30,064 --> 01:31:33,136
I've decided I do believe in destiny
after all.

745
01:31:33,224 --> 01:31:36,694
Do you, my darling? I'm very glad.

746

Cocher.

747
01:31:47,824 --> 01:31:50,497
Cocher!

748
01:31:56,064 --> 01:31:57,292
You'll wake him.

749
01:31:57,384 --> 01:32:00,421
But I want to know where we are.

750
01:32:01,704 --> 01:32:03,456
Cocher? Co...

751
01:32:16,664 --> 01:32:19,576
0ne day, when I'm old,

752
01:32:19,664 --> 01:32:22,701
I want some lovely young girl
to say to me...

753
01:32:24,184 --> 01:32:30,020
"Tell me, where in your long life,
Mr Craster, were you most happy?"

754
01:32:31,304 --> 01:32:32,783
And I shall say...

755
01:32:32,864 --> 01:32:37,301
"Well, my dear, I never knew
the exact place.

756
01:32:37,384 --> 01:32:40,933
"It was somewhere
on the Mediterranean.

757
01:32:41,024 --> 01:32:43,333
"I was with Victoria Page."

758
01:32:44,424 --> 01:32:49,418
"What?" she will say.
"Do you mean the famous dancer?"

759
01:32:49,504 --> 01:32:54,737
And I will nod, "Yes, my dear, I do.

760
01:32:54,824 --> 01:33:01,502
"But then, she was quite young,
comparatively unspoiled.

761
01:33:01,584 --> 01:33:06,897
"We were, I remember,
very much in love."

763
01:33:47,664 --> 01:33:49,541
Did you see that?

764
01:33:49,624 --> 01:33:51,694
She smiled at Craster.

765
01:33:51,784 --> 01:33:52,978
I don't think so.

766
01:33:53,064 --> 01:33:56,454
I suppose you will be sending me
to an oculist next.

767
01:34:00,384 --> 01:34:01,942
Watch her dancing.

768
01:34:03,064 --> 01:34:04,861
With pleasure.

770
01:34:17,984 --> 01:34:20,942
Yes. Yes!

771
01:34:22,264 --> 01:34:24,494
Yes. All right. Thursday.

772
01:34:24,584 --> 01:34:26,415
Good evening, Mr Lermontov.

773
01:34:26,504 --> 01:34:29,416
I'm afraid the score's
still a bit rough,

774
01:34:29,504 --> 01:34:31,779
but I see you had
time to look at it.

775
01:34:31,864 --> 01:34:33,820
Yes, Mr Craster.

776
01:34:35,144 --> 01:34:36,736
I have looked at it.

777
01:34:39,184 --> 01:34:43,655
However, it's not about your music
that I wish to talk at the moment.

778
01:34:43,744 --> 01:34:45,974
So to come to the point...

779
01:34:46,064 --> 01:34:49,215
What is all this I hear
about you and Miss Page?

780
01:34:49,304 --> 01:34:51,101
0h, I see.

781
01:34:52,184 --> 01:34:54,652
- Could Dimitri...?
- Get out.

782
01:34:54,744 --> 01:34:57,463
Well, Mr Craster?

783
01:35:02,064 --> 01:35:03,577
Yes. We're in love.

784
01:35:06,024 --> 01:35:07,935
I see.

785
01:35:09,304 --> 01:35:12,455
Did you see Miss Page's performance
in Lac des Cygnes?

786
01:35:12,544 --> 01:35:14,216
I was conducting.

787
01:35:14,304 --> 01:35:15,498
Did you enjoy it?

788
01:35:15,584 --> 01:35:18,223
It was the loveliest thing
I've ever seen.

789
01:35:18,304 --> 01:35:20,374
It was impossible.

790
01:35:21,464 --> 01:35:24,103
And you know why it was impossible?

791
01:35:24,184 --> 01:35:27,699
Because neither her mind nor her
heart were in her work.

792
01:35:27,784 --> 01:35:30,298
She was...dreaming.

793
01:35:30,384 --> 01:35:34,536
And dreaming is a luxury
I've never permitted in my company.

794
01:35:34,624 --> 01:35:36,899
Miss Page wants to be a great dancer.

795
01:35:36,984 --> 01:35:40,021
Perhaps she has spoken to you
about her ambitions.

796
01:35:40,104 --> 01:35:41,253
0h, yes.

797
01:35:41,344 --> 01:35:44,575
She's not, however,
a great dancer yet.

798
01:35:44,664 --> 01:35:46,495
Nor is she likely to become one

799
01:35:46,584 --> 01:35:51,612
if she allows herself to be
sidetracked by idiotic flirtations.

800
01:35:51,704 --> 01:35:54,741
Mr Lermontov, you...don't understand.

801
01:35:55,824 --> 01:35:57,780
We really are in love.

802
01:36:03,784 --> 01:36:08,494
And, Mr Craster, I have had time
to look at your latest effort...

803
01:36:08,584 --> 01:36:09,653
Yes?

804
01:36:09,744 --> 01:36:11,974
..and find it equally impossible.

805
01:36:22,864 --> 01:36:25,936
That's not true. It's good.

806
01:36:26,024 --> 01:36:27,980
Childish...

807
01:36:28,064 --> 01:36:30,703
vulgar...
and completely insignificant.

808
01:36:31,824 --> 01:36:34,736
In that case,
I'll relieve you of it.

809
01:36:34,824 --> 01:36:38,021
There are so many
first-class ballet companies

810
01:36:38,104 --> 01:36:40,777
to which you may
take it with advantage.

811
01:36:40,864 --> 01:36:42,900
Ballet work is not my great ambition.

812
01:36:42,984 --> 01:36:47,262
Some of us think it's rather
a second-rate means of expression.

813
01:36:51,664 --> 01:36:55,816
- '0ui, Monsieur Lermontov?'
- Mr Craster is leaving the company.

814
01:36:55,904 --> 01:36:59,180
Pay him two weeks' salary
and get the receipt.

815
01:37:27,464 --> 01:37:29,102
0h, hello, Boris.

816
01:37:29,184 --> 01:37:31,823
- I was coming to say good night.
- Good night.

817
01:37:31,904 --> 01:37:33,895
- Is anything the matter?
- No, no.

818
01:37:33,984 --> 01:37:37,943
And before I forget, don't do any
more work on the new ballet.

819
01:37:38,024 --> 01:37:41,414
- I decided to scrap it.
- Scrap it? What do you mean?

820
01:37:41,504 --> 01:37:44,302
I worked out
half the choreography already.

821
01:37:44,384 --> 01:37:46,773
That boy Julian is really gifted.

822
01:37:46,864 --> 01:37:49,094
It's one of our finest scores.

823
01:37:49,184 --> 01:37:53,939
Julian Craster is leaving and
I don't wish to discuss it further.

824
01:37:54,024 --> 01:37:56,584
0h, you don't? Well, I do!

825
01:37:56,664 --> 01:38:00,623
Do you think I don't know
a brilliant score when I hear one?

826
01:38:00,704 --> 01:38:03,502
Do you think I've been
working day and night

827
01:38:03,624 --> 01:38:07,583
for the pleasure of being told
I am wasting my time?

828
01:38:07,664 --> 01:38:14,263
I tell you, Boris, I've had enough
of this lunatic asylum!

829
01:38:14,344 --> 01:38:16,619
I am through with it!

830
01:38:16,704 --> 01:38:18,535
I resign!

831
01:38:19,704 --> 01:38:22,821
I think you've made
a very important decision.

832
01:38:36,144 --> 01:38:39,978
Hello, you two. Isn't love wonderful?.

833
01:38:43,544 --> 01:38:45,819
Bonsoir, Julian.

834
01:38:45,904 --> 01:38:47,462
Hello.

835
01:38:52,344 --> 01:38:54,096
Well, what did he say?

836
01:38:54,184 --> 01:38:58,621
Ah. 0f course he doesn't really
want you to go, Grischa.

837
01:38:58,704 --> 01:38:59,978
He is very sorry.

838
01:39:00,064 --> 01:39:03,374
Well, in that case,
I will think about it.

839
01:39:03,464 --> 01:39:04,817
What about Julian?

840
01:39:04,904 --> 01:39:10,456
I have never seen him
quite as bad as this.

841
01:39:10,544 --> 01:39:16,540
He talked a great deal about
ingratitude and...disloyalty.

842
01:39:16,624 --> 01:39:20,333
And he said when personal relations
start to interfere...

843
01:39:20,424 --> 01:39:22,142
Yes, I know that bit.

844
01:39:23,264 --> 01:39:27,143
My dear children, I'm very sorry.

845
01:39:29,104 --> 01:39:32,016
Boris might feel different
in the morning.

846
01:39:32,104 --> 01:39:36,814
The morning? He's leaving for Paris
by the 8.15 train.

847
01:40:05,504 --> 01:40:08,177
Has the famous Miss Page
come to see me off?

848
01:40:09,584 --> 01:40:11,415
I'd like to talk to you.

849
01:40:21,024 --> 01:40:24,300
I want to know
why you quarrelled with Julian.

850
01:40:24,384 --> 01:40:28,297
May I suggest that such matters
are hardly your business?

851
01:40:30,304 --> 01:40:33,455
However, since you've gone to
all this trouble...

852
01:40:35,664 --> 01:40:40,021
Mr Craster has been unwise enough
to interfere with plans of mine.

853
01:40:40,104 --> 01:40:42,777
And that is something
I do not permit.

854
01:40:44,824 --> 01:40:48,214
I thought once that
there would be no room in my life

855
01:40:48,304 --> 01:40:50,898
for anything but dancing.

856
01:40:50,984 --> 01:40:52,975
You'll think so again, my dear.

857
01:40:53,064 --> 01:40:55,419
But if Julian goes, I shall go, too.

858
01:40:58,344 --> 01:41:00,335
And what do you intend to do?

859
01:41:00,424 --> 01:41:02,096
I shall dance somewhere else.

860
01:41:02,184 --> 01:41:04,220
0h, yes.

861
01:41:04,304 --> 01:41:08,013
That won't be very difficult
with the name I've given you.

862
01:41:08,104 --> 01:41:11,540
Always provided I release you
of your contract.

863
01:41:12,664 --> 01:41:17,419
But even if I do,
would it be quite the same?

864
01:41:18,824 --> 01:41:21,099
I have never pretended it would.

865
01:41:24,264 --> 01:41:29,816
I could make you one of the greatest
dancers the world has ever known.

866
01:41:32,544 --> 01:41:36,856
- Do you believe that?
- Yes, I do.

867
01:41:39,064 --> 01:41:41,180
And all that means nothing to you?

868
01:41:43,304 --> 01:41:45,943
You know exactly
what it means to me.

869
01:41:51,184 --> 01:41:53,459
The train is leaving!

870
01:41:54,904 --> 01:41:56,417
Goodbye, Mr Lermontov.

871
01:42:02,784 --> 01:42:05,173
Miss Page is coming!

872
01:42:12,464 --> 01:42:16,173
Julian! Julian!

873
01:42:18,464 --> 01:42:20,102
I'm coming with you!

874
01:42:20,184 --> 01:42:22,539
Hooray!

875
01:43:16,504 --> 01:43:18,062
The fool.

876
01:43:20,664 --> 01:43:22,222
The fool.

877
01:43:24,944 --> 01:43:26,582
No!

878
01:44:04,504 --> 01:44:06,972
Come in. You are late.

879
01:44:07,064 --> 01:44:09,100
I hope you didn't work too hard.

880
01:44:09,184 --> 01:44:12,415
All finished.
I have the injunction with me.

881
01:44:41,904 --> 01:44:45,453
Boris, don't tell me you've
changed your mind again.

882
01:44:50,744 --> 01:44:54,976
I...I don't want to stop her
doing anything.

883
01:44:56,064 --> 01:45:01,184
She can dance when and where
she likes...except the Red Shoes.

884
01:45:01,264 --> 01:45:03,937
- What about the boy?
- That's different.

885
01:45:04,024 --> 01:45:07,061
Everything written under contract
to me is mine.

886
01:45:07,144 --> 01:45:10,693
The Red Shoes and his work so far
on La Belle Meunière.

887
01:45:10,784 --> 01:45:13,457
I'm not interested in
anything else he writes.

888
01:45:13,544 --> 01:45:17,059
If you do The Red Shoes,
you'll have to pay him royalties.

889
01:45:17,144 --> 01:45:19,942
Red Shoes is no longer
in the repertoire!

890
01:45:20,024 --> 01:45:21,343
0h.

891
01:45:29,104 --> 01:45:32,016
I understand Patrick Trevellyan
is in Paris.

892
01:45:33,144 --> 01:45:34,463
Yes.

893
01:45:34,544 --> 01:45:36,580
I dined with them both last night.

894
01:45:36,664 --> 01:45:38,859
0h?

895
01:45:38,944 --> 01:45:42,061
- Boronskaja was with him?
- Yes.

896
01:45:43,344 --> 01:45:44,618
Anything I can do?

897
01:45:44,704 --> 01:45:46,934
How's their marriage? Success?

898
01:45:47,024 --> 01:45:49,413
Patrick seems to think so.

899
01:45:49,504 --> 01:45:52,894
Would you like me to arrange
a meeting with Irina?

900
01:45:54,264 --> 01:45:55,982
Not arrange.

901
01:45:57,344 --> 01:45:59,096
By chance.

902
01:46:28,344 --> 01:46:29,857
0h! Boris!

903
01:46:34,584 --> 01:46:36,540
( # Les Sylphides )

904
01:47:00,784 --> 01:47:03,776
- Good night, Boris.
- Good night, Irina.

905
01:47:05,584 --> 01:47:09,133
- Good season.
- With the Ballet Lermontov, always.

906
01:47:10,624 --> 01:47:13,582
- Good night, Boris.
- Good night, Sergei.

907
01:47:13,664 --> 01:47:14,858
- Sergei!
- Yes?

908
01:47:14,944 --> 01:47:18,698
- Would you wait a minute, please?
- Yes, of course, Boris.

909
01:47:22,784 --> 01:47:26,174
- Good night, Boris!
- Grischa, please come in and wait.

910
01:47:27,384 --> 01:47:30,820
0h...a conference.

911
01:47:32,504 --> 01:47:34,813
- Ah!
- Uh!

912
01:47:38,864 --> 01:47:40,422
Letters.

913
01:47:41,504 --> 01:47:45,179
- Nobody writes to me.
- That's not true.

914
01:47:45,264 --> 01:47:47,573
Yours...from Vicky.

915
01:47:47,664 --> 01:47:50,098
From Vicky?

916
01:47:50,184 --> 01:47:52,698
- How is that girl?.
- Read it. You'll see.

917
01:47:53,784 --> 01:47:55,775
And this is from Julian.

918
01:47:55,864 --> 01:47:57,741
It's all about his new opera.

919
01:47:58,984 --> 01:48:05,332
It describes the whole structure.
Enormous talent, that boy.

920
01:48:08,784 --> 01:48:10,103
He says...

921
01:48:11,184 --> 01:48:13,379
"She is an inspiration.

922
01:48:15,384 --> 01:48:16,703
"A miracle."

923
01:48:16,784 --> 01:48:20,220
- Thank you, Mr Boudin. That's all.
- Merci. Bonsoir.

924
01:48:20,304 --> 01:48:23,341
Well...I see it's mail day.

925
01:48:23,424 --> 01:48:25,858
From our two young rebels.

926
01:48:25,944 --> 01:48:29,698
Deserters. I hope they're happy.

927
01:48:29,784 --> 01:48:32,742
- Read, Boris.
- Yes. Read this, too.

928
01:48:32,824 --> 01:48:36,214
It might make you sorry
to have lost that young man.

929
01:48:36,304 --> 01:48:38,260
I doubt it.

930
01:48:38,344 --> 01:48:39,743
That reminds me...

931
01:48:39,824 --> 01:48:43,499
Jacques sent me
the new score of La Belle Meunière.

932
01:48:43,584 --> 01:48:46,382
I like it.
I'd like you all to hear it at once.

933
01:48:46,464 --> 01:48:48,500
We might open with it in London.

934
01:48:48,584 --> 01:48:51,337
- With Irina?
- We can discuss that.

935
01:48:51,984 --> 01:48:54,418
Lights, all gaiety, fire.

936
01:48:54,504 --> 01:48:58,497
Be good enough to glance through it.
And no prejudice, please.

937
01:48:58,584 --> 01:49:01,178
I hope you say that
to yourself sometimes.

938
01:49:01,264 --> 01:49:02,902
Every day. Good night.

939
01:49:02,984 --> 01:49:04,815
- Good night.
- Good night.

940
01:49:04,904 --> 01:49:08,374
0n second thought, I think
I would like to read those letters.

941
01:49:15,424 --> 01:49:19,258
My letter was only meant
to be read by me.

942
01:49:19,344 --> 01:49:21,175
See you later, Boris.

943
01:49:21,264 --> 01:49:22,538
Good night, Sergei.

944
01:49:31,344 --> 01:49:34,336
I could hardly let him read it.

945
01:49:34,424 --> 01:49:36,858
She calls him a monster...

946
01:49:36,944 --> 01:49:39,617
a gifted, cruel monster.

947
01:49:39,704 --> 01:49:41,660
You should have told him that.

948
01:53:59,064 --> 01:54:02,693
I...I am sorry to be late,
Boris Lermontov.

949
01:54:07,624 --> 01:54:10,058
Lady Neston was in front tonight.

950
01:54:11,144 --> 01:54:14,614
She arrived this morning.
She is staying for several weeks.

951
01:54:15,704 --> 01:54:19,333
And Miss Page is joining her
next week for a short holiday.

952
01:54:49,664 --> 01:54:53,293
We seem destined to meet
at railway stations.

953
01:54:53,384 --> 01:54:58,060
- What are you doing in Cannes?
- Waiting for you. Won't you sit?

954
01:55:05,264 --> 01:55:07,095
But you know, my dear Vicky,

955
01:55:07,184 --> 01:55:09,982
how I'm always looking
for great dancers.

956
01:55:16,504 --> 01:55:18,062
We all have missed you.

957
01:55:18,144 --> 01:55:22,137
And I was hoping that by now
you would have started to miss us...

958
01:55:22,224 --> 01:55:23,737
a little.

959
01:55:23,824 --> 01:55:25,576
I have.

960
01:55:26,704 --> 01:55:29,138
You only have to say the words.

961
01:55:31,024 --> 01:55:34,096
- How is everybody?
- Never better.

962
01:55:34,184 --> 01:55:37,540
- How is Grischa?
- Always fighting with Boronskaja.

963
01:55:37,624 --> 01:55:40,297
- And she?
- Always fighting with Grischa.

964
01:55:40,384 --> 01:55:42,056
- Sergei?
- Getting younger.

965
01:55:42,144 --> 01:55:44,738
- And you?
- Getting older.

966
01:55:44,824 --> 01:55:47,213
And you? You are happy?

967
01:55:47,304 --> 01:55:49,340
Yes. Very happy.

968
01:55:50,384 --> 01:55:52,420
As a dancer, I mean.

969
01:55:53,664 --> 01:55:55,780
I haven't danced much, you know.

970
01:55:55,864 --> 01:55:57,092
0h, I know.

971
01:55:57,184 --> 01:55:59,744
I know every time you have danced.

972
01:55:59,824 --> 01:56:02,179
- But you never stopped working?
- No.

973
01:56:02,264 --> 01:56:05,813
- You never stopped going to class?
- Never.

974
01:56:07,224 --> 01:56:09,419
And why isn't he with you?

975
01:56:09,504 --> 01:56:12,098
His opera's been accepted
at Covent Garden.

976
01:56:12,184 --> 01:56:13,617
It's in rehearsal now.

977
01:56:13,704 --> 01:56:16,821
- Would he give it up if you asked?
- I don't know.

978
01:56:16,904 --> 01:56:18,701
- You do.
- I wouldn't ask.

979
01:56:18,784 --> 01:56:23,699
Then why is he asking you?
Does he know what he is asking?

980
01:56:30,424 --> 01:56:35,373
We are preparing a new ballet.
We've been working for weeks.

981
01:56:35,464 --> 01:56:39,980
The costumes and the decor are the
most beautiful Ratov has ever done.

982
01:56:40,064 --> 01:56:44,023
Grischa's full of enthusiasm.
Do you know what that means?

983
01:56:48,744 --> 01:56:53,135
Nobody else has ever danced
The Red Shoes since you left.

984
01:56:54,544 --> 01:56:56,500
Nobody else ever shall.

985
01:56:59,144 --> 01:57:01,533
Put on the red shoes, Vicky...

986
01:57:01,624 --> 01:57:04,184
and dance for us again.

987
01:57:12,584 --> 01:57:14,654
'This is the BBC Third Program.

988
01:57:14,744 --> 01:57:18,180

'I'll announce the cast

1003
01:58:20,144 --> 01:58:24,422
All the way down from London,
I wondered if I'd find you here.

1004
01:58:24,504 --> 01:58:26,142
And here you are.

1005
01:58:26,224 --> 01:58:30,934
- So you left your first night?
- Yes.

1006
01:58:31,024 --> 01:58:32,935
0h, Julian.

1007
01:58:34,024 --> 01:58:35,855
Why didn't you?

1008
01:58:41,184 --> 01:58:44,494
This is all that matters.

1009
01:58:45,584 --> 01:58:48,303
All right, love, my sweetheart.

1010
01:58:48,384 --> 01:58:52,093
There's a train to Paris at 8.00.
We'll be on it together.

1011
01:58:53,144 --> 01:58:54,975
Better hurry and get changed.

1012
01:58:55,064 --> 01:58:57,259
- But I'm dancing tonight.
- Walk out.

1013
01:58:58,864 --> 01:59:00,582
Good evening, Mr Craster.

1014
01:59:00,664 --> 01:59:03,622
Won't they be missing you
at Covent Garden?

1015
01:59:05,584 --> 01:59:07,302
Leave me alone, both of you!

1016
01:59:07,384 --> 01:59:10,615
Please, Julian,
wait until after the performance.

1017
01:59:10,704 --> 01:59:12,137
it'll be too late then.

1018
01:59:12,224 --> 01:59:16,581
You're already too late, Mr Craster.
Tell him why you've left him.

1019
01:59:16,664 --> 01:59:18,461
- I haven't left him!
- 0h, yes.

1020
01:59:18,544 --> 01:59:21,217
Nobody can have two lives -
yours is dancing.

1021
01:59:21,304 --> 01:59:24,899
Vicky, you can dance anywhere else
in the whole world.

1022
01:59:24,984 --> 01:59:27,942
Would you be satisfied
with less than the best?

1023
01:59:28,024 --> 01:59:30,060
If so, you'd never be a great artist.

1024
01:59:30,144 --> 01:59:32,897
Would you make her
a great dancer as well?.

1025
01:59:32,984 --> 01:59:34,133
Never!

1026
01:59:34,224 --> 01:59:39,537
Why do you think I've waited so long
for a chance to win her back?

1027
01:59:39,624 --> 01:59:42,138
- Because you're jealous of her.
- Yes!

1028
01:59:42,224 --> 01:59:45,694
I am...but in a way that
you will never understand.

1029
01:59:48,304 --> 01:59:49,817
Wait!

1030
01:59:54,984 --> 01:59:56,463
Well, Vicky?

1031
01:59:56,544 --> 02:00:00,173
I love you, Julian! Nobody but you!

1032
02:00:03,104 --> 02:00:04,583
But you love that more.

1033
02:00:05,704 --> 02:00:08,457
I don't know! I don't know.

1034
02:00:10,064 --> 02:00:13,739
If you go with him now,
I will never take you back. Never!

1035
02:00:13,824 --> 02:00:17,055
Vicky, do you want to
destroy our love?

1036
02:00:17,144 --> 02:00:19,135
Adolescent nonsense!

1037
02:00:19,224 --> 02:00:22,978
All right. Go, then. Go with him.

1038
02:00:23,064 --> 02:00:28,263
Be a faithful housewife
with a crowd of screaming children!

1039
02:00:28,344 --> 02:00:30,574
Finish with dancing forever!

1040
02:00:30,664 --> 02:00:32,700
Vicky...look at me.

1041
02:00:51,264 --> 02:00:53,698
Goodbye, then, my darling.

1042
02:00:57,224 --> 02:00:58,703
Julian.

1043
02:01:02,424 --> 02:01:05,018
Peut-on commencer l'ouverture?

1044
02:01:05,104 --> 02:01:08,062
- 0ui. Commencez.
- Bon. Bon. Bon.

1045
02:01:08,504 --> 02:01:11,576
Alors, commencez toute de suite.
Vite! Vite!

1046
02:01:11,664 --> 02:01:13,063
Vicky...

1047
02:01:14,344 --> 02:01:19,418
Vicky. Little Vicky.

1048
02:01:21,504 --> 02:01:24,735
There it is, all waiting for you.

1049
02:01:24,824 --> 02:01:28,499
The sorrow will pass, believe me.

1050
02:01:28,584 --> 02:01:31,815
Life is so unimportant.

1051
02:01:33,304 --> 02:01:37,502
And from now onwards,
you will dance...

1052
02:01:38,584 --> 02:01:40,700
like nobody ever before.

1053
02:02:16,224 --> 02:02:17,577
Mon petit.

1054
02:02:20,544 --> 02:02:23,616
Mon petit! Ah! Monsieur Lermontov!

1055
02:02:32,904 --> 02:02:35,179
Mademoiselle Page!

1056
02:03:42,024 --> 02:03:46,415
Ladies...and gentlemen!

1057
02:03:50,264 --> 02:03:54,655
I'm sorry...to tell you...

1058
02:03:57,024 --> 02:04:01,222
that Miss Page...is unable...

1059
02:04:02,704 --> 02:04:05,741
to dance...tonight...

1060
02:04:08,384 --> 02:04:10,340
Nor indeed...

1061
02:04:12,424 --> 02:04:13,618
any other nights.

1062
02:04:17,744 --> 02:04:22,818
Nevertheless...we've decided...

1063
02:04:26,144 --> 02:04:30,376
to present...The Red Shoes!

1064
02:04:35,384 --> 02:04:37,340
It...is...

1065
02:04:38,504 --> 02:04:40,062
the ballet...

1066
02:04:42,944 --> 02:04:44,741
that made her name...

1067
02:04:46,904 --> 02:04:50,658
whose name...she made.

1068
02:04:51,784 --> 02:04:54,776
We...present it...

1069
02:04:57,784 --> 02:05:04,098
because...we think...

1070
02:05:07,104 --> 02:05:08,776
she would have...

1071
02:05:10,504 --> 02:05:13,064
wished it.

1072
02:05:47,904 --> 02:05:49,132
Pas d'espoir.

1073
02:05:58,024 --> 02:06:00,219
Julian?

1074
02:06:00,304 --> 02:06:02,260
Yes, my darling?

1075
02:06:02,344 --> 02:06:05,256
Take off the red shoes.
