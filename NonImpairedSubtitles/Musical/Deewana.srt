1
00:00:35,702 --> 00:00:37,329
- Kashiram!
- Yes Madam!

2
00:00:37,404 --> 00:00:39,338
Have you packed
Prince's bags?

3
00:00:39,406 --> 00:00:41,340
Did you pack his warm clothes
too? It must be cold there.

4
00:00:41,708 --> 00:00:43,335
Don't worry!
I've packed everything!

5
00:00:50,383 --> 00:00:54,683
Check the things carefully!

6
00:00:55,388 --> 00:00:57,356
Alright, Madam!

7
00:00:57,457 --> 00:01:00,688
It's time for the Tilak
and Ravi hasn't come yet!

8
00:01:04,798 --> 00:01:10,031
Munshi! Call the station master
and instruct him to hold the train.

9
00:01:11,071 --> 00:01:13,039
He's so undisciplined!

10
00:01:16,076 --> 00:01:19,705
You cheat! You pretend to
love me as you're leaving now!

11
00:01:21,081 --> 00:01:23,049
Please apply vermilion
on his forehead!

12
00:01:23,750 --> 00:01:26,048
His face bears
a special radiance!

13
00:01:26,753 --> 00:01:29,722
That's the reason
he's popular!

14
00:01:30,423 --> 00:01:32,391
- I'm late, shall we go?
- You must...

15
00:01:32,459 --> 00:01:34,051
Take care of yourself
on reaching there.

16
00:01:39,099 --> 00:01:41,567
I don't trust you.
Out of sight, out of mind!

17
00:01:42,602 --> 00:01:46,732
The whole house wears a
deserted look in your absence.

18
00:01:47,440 --> 00:01:50,409
In that case I won't go.
I'll cancel the show!

19
00:01:50,610 --> 00:01:54,740
lf you care for your mother,
get married soon!

20
00:01:56,449 --> 00:01:59,418
Brides aren't available
in the market, Mom!

21
00:02:00,120 --> 00:02:02,088
She is a doll as far as
this house is concerned!

22
00:02:02,622 --> 00:02:05,750
- When will you bring her?
- During this trip, perhaps.

23
00:02:06,126 --> 00:02:08,094
- In a wink!
- I hope so!

24
00:02:08,461 --> 00:02:11,828
But you must promise me not
to faint after seeing her.

25
00:02:12,132 --> 00:02:14,100
I promise...to faint!

26
00:02:19,472 --> 00:02:21,770
- You take care of yourself too.
- Bye!

27
00:02:25,145 --> 00:02:27,113
Uncle has come too!

28
00:02:32,819 --> 00:02:35,117
Where are you heading to?

29
00:02:35,488 --> 00:02:37,456
To Sundernagar!
Bless me, Uncle!

30
00:02:37,657 --> 00:02:39,784
- God bless you!
- Bless me, aunty!

31
00:02:39,859 --> 00:02:41,451
I've got to perform at a concert
there. I take your leave now.

32
00:02:44,164 --> 00:02:46,860
- Bless me, sister-in-law!
- Bye, son!

33
00:02:50,170 --> 00:02:52,138
- Narendra! - Yes.
- Get those files! - Sure!

34
00:02:57,177 --> 00:02:59,805
Ravi is the crown prince!

35
00:03:00,180 --> 00:03:03,809
He has to manage this
huge Empire, right?

36
00:03:04,517 --> 00:03:06,485
But he seems to
neglect everything!

37
00:03:06,853 --> 00:03:09,822
Music doesn't suit
our family, sister-in-law!

38
00:03:10,190 --> 00:03:12,488
Ravi is immature yet!

39
00:03:12,859 --> 00:03:14,827
He will understand
everything gradually.

40
00:03:14,894 --> 00:03:16,828
Moreover, music is
only his hobby.

41
00:03:17,697 --> 00:03:20,495
But our honour is at stake!

42
00:03:20,934 --> 00:03:23,903
Calm down, brother!

43
00:03:24,871 --> 00:03:27,499
You've got to sign
a few documents!

44
00:03:28,208 --> 00:03:30,904
- I see! - These documents
pertain to the Jungle!

45
00:03:31,544 --> 00:03:33,842
These are details of the
material we've supplied!

46
00:03:35,215 --> 00:03:37,513
And these are the new tenders
that have been passed recently.

47
00:03:37,884 --> 00:03:40,512
I trust you.
Where do I have to sign!

48
00:03:40,887 --> 00:03:43,856
- Please read them at least once.
- You must read them, aunty.

49
00:03:44,224 --> 00:03:47,193
Else, Papa may transfer all
the property to his name.

50
00:03:47,894 --> 00:03:50,863
It will only prove beneficial,
even if I do so.

51
00:03:53,233 --> 00:03:57,192
- Sign here! - I look
forward to Ravi's marriage!

52
00:03:57,904 --> 00:04:03,206
I'll go on a pilgrimage once
Ravi settles down in life.

53
00:04:03,977 --> 00:04:05,945
Ravi will
automatically take...

54
00:04:25,932 --> 00:04:27,900
Wealth is fascinating indeed!

55
00:04:28,935 --> 00:04:32,564
One is never content!
He craves for more and more!

56
00:04:34,607 --> 00:04:37,735
You've involved me too
in this sinful deed!

57
00:04:38,611 --> 00:04:42,911
If Queen Mother learns
of the truth, we'll be doomed!

58
00:04:43,616 --> 00:04:46,915
You know that I fear
death, don't you?

59
00:04:47,020 --> 00:04:48,988
Don't worry, Chintamani!

60
00:04:49,622 --> 00:04:51,590
Anxiety is as good as a pyre!

61
00:04:52,625 --> 00:04:54,252
But I'm making
arrangements for...

62
00:04:54,327 --> 00:04:56,261
...that old woman and
her son's funeral pyre.

63
00:04:57,964 --> 00:05:02,594
As it is all the properties
are being transferred...

64
00:05:02,669 --> 00:05:04,603
...to my son's name,
gradually.

65
00:05:05,972 --> 00:05:10,602
Once the formalities
are completed...

66
00:05:10,710 --> 00:05:13,270
Mother and son
will be finished!

67
00:05:14,814 --> 00:05:16,782
I am only her step
brother-in-law after all!

68
00:05:17,984 --> 00:05:20,953
You don't know how one feels
when one is a step-brother.

69
00:05:22,655 --> 00:05:24,953
I've tolerated
all the injustice!

70
00:05:27,327 --> 00:05:29,955
I shall avenge every insult!

71
00:05:31,664 --> 00:05:33,962
I shall ruin the entire family!

72
00:05:35,668 --> 00:05:41,971
Thereafter, I shall
rule the Empire!

73
00:05:43,343 --> 00:05:45,971
I shall rule the Empire!

74
00:06:41,401 --> 00:06:43,369
He was the Queen's
faithful servant!

75
00:06:44,404 --> 00:06:46,372
He died an unnatural death!

76
00:07:42,128 --> 00:07:44,426
I think jovial people like you
reside in Sundernagar!

77
00:07:45,465 --> 00:07:47,433
Thanks for the compliment!

78
00:07:47,500 --> 00:07:50,435
But only an artiste can
recognize another artiste!

79
00:07:50,970 --> 00:07:52,938
- Are you an artiste too?
- Yes!

80
00:07:53,139 --> 00:07:55,437
I'm Devdas, the all rounder!

81
00:07:55,508 --> 00:07:57,772
I write lyrics and compose
music for them and sing as well.

82
00:08:00,480 --> 00:08:03,449
Hear me folks

83
00:08:06,152 --> 00:08:08,120
You have a sweet voice indeed!

84
00:08:09,155 --> 00:08:11,453
Shall I sing a song for you?

85
00:08:42,522 --> 00:08:44,490
What have you done?
Be careful!

86
00:08:44,690 --> 00:08:48,490
I was engrossed in your tune!

87
00:08:49,195 --> 00:08:51,163
Strange!

88
00:08:52,532 --> 00:08:57,162
- Had the vehicle skid...
- There would be a program...

89
00:08:57,236 --> 00:08:59,170
...but of a different type!

90
00:08:59,872 --> 00:09:01,840
Please proceed
to the guest house!

91
00:09:03,209 --> 00:09:05,177
Strange indeed!

92
00:09:07,213 --> 00:09:09,181
I've unloaded your luggage!

93
00:09:10,883 --> 00:09:13,511
I think I must beware of you!

94
00:09:14,554 --> 00:09:17,182
How long will you
beware of me, Sir?

95
00:09:17,557 --> 00:09:20,526
I've transformed my wife
from Paro to Chandramukhi!

96
00:09:20,893 --> 00:09:22,861
Are you a magician as well?

97
00:09:25,898 --> 00:09:30,028
Maidens living here tend to cast
a magical spell on people around!

98
00:09:30,236 --> 00:09:34,195
- Are you married? - No! - You
can't escape their clutches then.

99
00:09:35,074 --> 00:09:37,542
- What do you mean?
- Don't meddle with these things...

100
00:09:37,610 --> 00:09:39,544
You mind only your business.

101
00:09:39,912 --> 00:09:42,210
You'd better not venture out!

102
00:09:42,582 --> 00:09:47,212
lf you move out, a pretty maiden
will cast a magical spell on you.

103
00:09:48,254 --> 00:09:50,882
Are you explaining to me
or scaring me?

104
00:09:52,258 --> 00:09:54,226
Are you trying to understand
or are you scared?

105
00:09:55,928 --> 00:09:58,226
Your rest house is very
comfortable, Mr. Devdas!

106
00:09:58,598 --> 00:10:00,566
Amitabh Bachchan too said
the same thing!

107
00:10:01,934 --> 00:10:04,903
I'll come to fetch you
at 7:00, sharp!

108
00:10:05,605 --> 00:10:07,903
You may relax,
I take your leave now!

109
00:10:09,275 --> 00:10:11,243
I'll come at 7:00!

110
00:10:13,346 --> 00:10:13,869
Seven friends
standing in a row

111
00:10:19,285 --> 00:10:23,244
Demanding tickets

112
00:10:26,125 --> 00:10:29,253
I told you that tickets
aren't available!

113
00:10:34,300 --> 00:10:37,929
Kajal! You won't gain anything
by jingling these anklets!

114
00:10:38,971 --> 00:10:42,270
People are quarrelling for tickets
as though there's an election!

115
00:10:42,642 --> 00:10:45,270
May you be cursed!
Why do you say so?

116
00:10:45,978 --> 00:10:49,277
- She's your only niece, right?
- I'm her only uncle, right?

117
00:10:49,649 --> 00:10:51,617
- What's the connection between
the 2? - They're connected.

118
00:10:51,984 --> 00:10:53,952
You claim to be
an influential man,...

119
00:10:54,020 --> 00:10:56,955
...can't you arrange for
a few tickets for her sake?

120
00:10:57,323 --> 00:10:59,291
- Aren't you ashamed?
- Why should I be ashamed?

121
00:10:59,659 --> 00:11:01,627
Do I have to arrange for
tickets to prove my identity?

122
00:11:02,328 --> 00:11:05,957
I said that tickets aren't
available and I mean it!

123
00:11:06,332 --> 00:11:07,959
I can't arrange for the tickets
even at the cost of my life.

124
00:11:09,669 --> 00:11:11,637
I'll kill you!

125
00:11:14,173 --> 00:11:16,300
Hey devil! Have you
taken it seriously?

126
00:11:17,009 --> 00:11:19,978
Calm down! I shall
try my best!

127
00:11:20,179 --> 00:11:23,637
I shall arrange for the tickets
at the cost of my job!

128
00:11:24,350 --> 00:11:25,977
Oh uncle!

129
00:11:28,020 --> 00:11:30,989
I won't hesitate even to resign
for the sake of your love!

130
00:11:31,190 --> 00:11:33,158
I shall form a Drama
company instead!

131
00:11:33,359 --> 00:11:35,987
But promise me, you will
work for me, won't you?

132
00:11:36,195 --> 00:11:38,993
- Promise me!
- I suspect foul play!

133
00:11:39,198 --> 00:11:41,166
My name is Chandramukhi,
after all!

134
00:11:41,367 --> 00:11:45,997
And you're the cause
of my miseries as well!

135
00:12:32,084 --> 00:12:34,052
I'm in a dilemma...

136
00:12:34,120 --> 00:12:37,453
...whether to
accept you or not

137
00:12:46,766 --> 00:12:52,398
Should my heart throb
for your sake?

138
00:12:54,106 --> 00:13:00,477
You're the girl of my dreams
and sweet memories

139
00:13:08,521 --> 00:13:14,426
l shall certainly find you

140
00:13:52,832 --> 00:13:58,793
You're a fragrant flower

141
00:14:07,847 --> 00:14:13,479
You're a poet's delight

142
00:14:15,187 --> 00:14:18,156
You bear an innocent face

143
00:14:18,591 --> 00:14:21,560
You resemble the moon

144
00:14:22,361 --> 00:14:25,489
You are worthy of praise

145
00:14:26,198 --> 00:14:29,167
Your looks are bewitching

146
00:14:30,369 --> 00:14:36,569
You're the epitome of beauty

147
00:15:27,426 --> 00:15:33,387
The day I catch sight of you

148
00:15:42,274 --> 00:15:48,235
l wonder what it will lead to

149
00:15:49,615 --> 00:15:52,584
l shall hold you in my eyes

150
00:15:53,285 --> 00:15:56,254
And in my arms as well

151
00:15:56,689 --> 00:16:03,424
l shall make you
the queen of my heart

152
00:16:04,964 --> 00:16:10,925
My heart craves for you

153
00:17:39,391 --> 00:17:41,359
Please make way!

154
00:17:41,727 --> 00:17:43,354
Please excuse me!

155
00:17:52,738 --> 00:17:54,365
What should we do, Kajal?

156
00:17:54,740 --> 00:17:58,369
Don't worry!
I'll do wonders!

157
00:17:59,411 --> 00:18:01,379
I'll kill him!

158
00:18:45,791 --> 00:18:47,816
Oh God! I'm dead!

159
00:18:48,127 --> 00:18:50,755
Stop!

160
00:18:52,464 --> 00:18:54,432
Who are you?

161
00:18:54,800 --> 00:18:56,768
What have you come here for?

162
00:18:57,469 --> 00:19:00,097
- Speak up, else...watchman!
- I'll kill you.

163
00:19:12,151 --> 00:19:14,119
- Will you kill me?
- Why did you threaten me then?

164
00:19:15,821 --> 00:19:17,789
What have you come
here for then?

165
00:19:24,830 --> 00:19:26,457
It's a good way
to get an autograph!

166
00:19:27,166 --> 00:19:29,794
l attended your show as well,
but people surrounded you, so...

167
00:19:29,868 --> 00:19:31,802
What's your name?

168
00:19:36,508 --> 00:19:38,476
Is it the kohl women
apply in their eyes...

169
00:19:38,544 --> 00:19:40,478
...or the one that's used to
cast the evil spell away?

170
00:19:41,513 --> 00:19:43,481
- Both!
- Both!?

171
00:19:45,517 --> 00:19:48,816
- What should I write?
- Anything nice!

172
00:20:04,870 --> 00:20:06,838
Happy?

173
00:20:09,541 --> 00:20:11,509
When you come the next time...
What happened?

174
00:20:11,577 --> 00:20:13,169
My leg is sprained.

175
00:20:13,545 --> 00:20:15,672
- Sprain?
- It's paining me!

176
00:20:17,549 --> 00:20:19,847
- How will I get back home?
- Home!?

177
00:20:21,720 --> 00:20:24,917
I'll take you home!
Come on! Take care!

178
00:20:25,224 --> 00:20:27,852
Take care! Where do you live?

179
00:20:28,560 --> 00:20:32,519
- There! - Where? - Near the
hillock, next to the big tree.

180
00:20:32,598 --> 00:20:35,863
Below Choturam's house and
next to Moturam's bungalow!

181
00:20:36,235 --> 00:20:39,204
My maternal uncle, Devdas'
home is situated there.

182
00:20:40,572 --> 00:20:42,870
- Mr. Devdas!? - Yes.
- Oh I see!

183
00:20:43,575 --> 00:20:45,873
So, you're Devdas'
niece, right?

184
00:20:46,745 --> 00:20:48,872
Everyone in Sundernagar
is like that, right?

185
00:20:49,248 --> 00:20:51,876
- Like what?
- Foolish!

186
00:20:54,586 --> 00:20:56,554
- Shut up!
- Guide me to your home!

187
00:20:57,589 --> 00:21:00,888
I'll get a heart attack.
He was so close!

188
00:21:01,260 --> 00:21:03,728
- Now he's gone so far.
- How lucky she is!

189
00:21:04,596 --> 00:21:09,226
One need not look
into the mirror

190
00:21:09,601 --> 00:21:13,230
It reflects one's age

191
00:21:14,606 --> 00:21:16,904
- Uncle!
- What's the matter?

192
00:21:17,609 --> 00:21:19,907
- What's wrong with my child?
- What happened, Kajal?

193
00:21:20,279 --> 00:21:22,247
Will you have mercy on me too?

194
00:21:25,017 --> 00:21:28,578
Guide me to her room so that
I can lighten this burden!

195
00:21:28,787 --> 00:21:31,756
- I'll kill you.
- Don't threaten me!

196
00:21:31,957 --> 00:21:34,255
- Show me!
- What should I show?

197
00:21:34,960 --> 00:21:38,919
- Her room.
- Follow me!

198
00:21:39,798 --> 00:21:42,767
Please come!
Please put her on this bed.

199
00:21:43,635 --> 00:21:45,603
Please put her on this bed!

200
00:21:45,971 --> 00:21:50,271
Will you tell me
what the matter is?

201
00:21:50,342 --> 00:21:52,276
I went on a stroll to
the hill-top and slipped...

202
00:21:52,644 --> 00:21:55,272
- I hope you aren't hurt!
- I am hurt!

203
00:21:55,347 --> 00:21:57,781
You've done what
Vibhishan did to Sudama.

204
00:21:57,849 --> 00:22:00,010
Not Vibhishan, Sudama!

205
00:22:00,652 --> 00:22:03,280
- That's what I meant!
- You chat while I serve tea.

206
00:22:03,655 --> 00:22:05,623
Hurry up!

207
00:22:06,825 --> 00:22:10,784
It's your picture!
Kajal is your ardent fan!

208
00:22:10,996 --> 00:22:12,964
She sings songs
composed by you!

209
00:22:24,009 --> 00:22:26,637
You must take good care of
yourself for a few days!

210
00:22:27,346 --> 00:22:30,315
I'll take care
of my reflection.

211
00:22:31,350 --> 00:22:34,319
It's very difficult, dear!

212
00:22:34,686 --> 00:22:37,985
- It costs a fortune!
- Is anything left?

213
00:22:38,690 --> 00:22:40,658
What's wrong with me?
My neighbour answers me...

214
00:22:40,726 --> 00:22:42,660
...when I question my wife.

215
00:22:43,028 --> 00:22:44,996
And now that I ask Kajal,
you're answering me instead!

216
00:22:46,865 --> 00:22:48,833
- Was that a joke?
- No!

217
00:22:49,368 --> 00:22:52,997
- Please have tea.
- Did you prepare only one cup?

218
00:22:53,372 --> 00:22:55,670
- You may...- You have it,
it's special.

219
00:22:56,041 --> 00:22:58,009
How long do you intend
to stay here?

220
00:22:59,111 --> 00:23:01,841
My mother says that witches
reside in hilly areas.

221
00:23:02,381 --> 00:23:05,839
- Hence, I plan to leave
tomorrow. - Not possible.

222
00:23:06,051 --> 00:23:09,350
You may come whenever you please,
but you can't leave as you please.

223
00:23:09,721 --> 00:23:13,350
- Right? - Right!
- Absolutely!

224
00:23:13,425 --> 00:23:15,359
Only an artiste can recognize
another artiste, right?

225
00:23:15,727 --> 00:23:17,695
Am I right?

226
00:23:18,397 --> 00:23:22,356
Remember, whenever you look
at yourself in the mirror,...

227
00:23:22,434 --> 00:23:25,369
...someone else too
is looking at you.

228
00:23:48,093 --> 00:23:50,061
`You're my desire!'

229
00:23:50,429 --> 00:23:53,057
`l wish to hear my name
from your lips!'

230
00:23:54,099 --> 00:23:56,397
`l wish to breathe through
your fragrant hair'

231
00:23:57,769 --> 00:24:01,068
`And I wish to see my picture
in your kohl filled eyes'

232
00:24:02,174 --> 00:24:05,143
`I've gathered the courage to
write to you now. Yours, Ravi'

233
00:24:10,115 --> 00:24:15,075
`My dear Kajal, you're
the light of my eyes'

234
00:24:15,787 --> 00:24:18,085
`You're the fragrance
of the night...

235
00:24:18,156 --> 00:24:20,090
...and the brightness
of the eve'

236
00:24:20,792 --> 00:24:23,090
When will you see me?
When shall we meet?

237
00:24:23,462 --> 00:24:25,430
When will you address me?

238
00:24:34,473 --> 00:24:38,136
I've booked Ravi's ticket
thrice and cancelled them too...

239
00:24:38,210 --> 00:24:41,179
...Ravi doesn't seem to
intend leaving the place.

240
00:24:42,147 --> 00:24:48,950
l must say, this place
is mesmerizing.

241
00:24:49,488 --> 00:24:52,787
I too was trapped by you
in a similar manner, right?

242
00:24:53,825 --> 00:24:58,125
- May you be doomed! - Where
are you heading to, Bahadur?

243
00:24:58,497 --> 00:25:00,795
- Sir!
- What's all this?

244
00:25:00,999 --> 00:25:03,968
- A love letter!
- For whom? - For Madam!

245
00:25:04,169 --> 00:25:07,138
What nonsense is this?

246
00:25:09,241 --> 00:25:14,474
A fragrant love letter!?
What are you up to, Chandramukhi?

247
00:25:14,846 --> 00:25:16,814
Are you bent on
tarnishing my image?

248
00:25:17,182 --> 00:25:20,208
What nonsense are you talking?
Are you out of your senses?

249
00:25:20,852 --> 00:25:23,150
- My reward! - You want a
reward, don't you? Take this.

250
00:25:24,523 --> 00:25:28,152
I'm doomed! My image
has been tarnished!

251
00:25:28,527 --> 00:25:31,826
- I'm doomed!
- What are you blabbering?

252
00:25:32,030 --> 00:25:37,161
Why don't you read the letter
first? Who will write to me?

253
00:25:37,536 --> 00:25:40,164
You're right! Hold this!

254
00:25:40,539 --> 00:25:42,837
Who will write
a letter to you?

255
00:25:42,908 --> 00:25:45,502
It's time for you
to get a telegram.

256
00:25:45,877 --> 00:25:47,845
Am I right?

257
00:25:57,889 --> 00:26:02,189
What are you laughing for?
Whose letter is it?

258
00:26:03,562 --> 00:26:07,020
You won't understand!
I'll explain to you.

259
00:26:07,566 --> 00:26:09,864
Where are you, my dear?

260
00:26:10,068 --> 00:26:12,036
My dear child!

261
00:26:16,908 --> 00:26:18,876
Do you love Ravi?

262
00:26:21,913 --> 00:26:23,881
Is this true?

263
00:26:24,316 --> 00:26:27,217
What's the truth?

264
00:26:27,586 --> 00:26:31,044
- Who's opened a flower
shop here? - Is it true?

265
00:26:31,923 --> 00:26:33,891
Answer me!

266
00:26:36,928 --> 00:26:41,228
- Hey!
- Why don't you answer me?

267
00:26:41,933 --> 00:26:44,231
I'll answer you, dear!

268
00:26:44,936 --> 00:26:48,565
Ravi loves Kajal!

269
00:26:48,940 --> 00:26:51,067
Kajal too loves him!

270
00:26:53,278 --> 00:26:57,237
But this isn't a suitable pair.
They're rich while we're poor.

271
00:26:57,949 --> 00:27:01,908
- I don't approve of it!
- You're so narrow minded.

272
00:27:02,287 --> 00:27:04,915
Only one artiste can identify
another artiste!

273
00:27:05,624 --> 00:27:07,592
- Am I right?
- Yes.

274
00:27:10,962 --> 00:27:13,260
- I'll kill you.
- I'm dead!

275
00:27:14,132 --> 00:27:16,100
Listen!

276
00:27:20,305 --> 00:27:23,274
`My songs are incomplete
and so is my breath'

277
00:27:24,142 --> 00:27:28,272
`My life is meaningless'

278
00:27:28,980 --> 00:27:32,279
`l long to see you'

279
00:27:32,651 --> 00:27:36,280
`Please have mercy on me'

280
00:28:01,346 --> 00:28:03,314
My love!

281
00:28:25,036 --> 00:28:27,664
Stop!

282
00:28:30,709 --> 00:28:34,167
My eyes are filled
with tears of joy.

283
00:28:39,050 --> 00:28:41,348
They're drops of
nectar and not tears!

284
00:28:42,053 --> 00:28:44,180
They're glittering
like the dew!

285
00:28:54,065 --> 00:28:56,033
You're the apple of my eye.

286
00:28:57,068 --> 00:28:57,659
My heart yearns for you...

287
00:29:03,441 --> 00:29:08,037
...it longs to see you

288
00:29:48,453 --> 00:29:52,753
Oh my love...

289
00:29:52,824 --> 00:29:55,759
...I love only you

290
00:30:05,537 --> 00:30:07,767
Oh my dear...

291
00:30:07,839 --> 00:30:13,436
...you are dear to me
as well

292
00:30:23,154 --> 00:30:30,458
l love only you

293
00:31:14,606 --> 00:31:19,566
l dream not anymore!

294
00:31:21,212 --> 00:31:26,172
Now that you reside
in my eyes

295
00:31:27,552 --> 00:31:32,512
You are by my side
every moment

296
00:31:33,892 --> 00:31:38,852
You reside in my heart

297
00:31:46,905 --> 00:31:53,868
l trust your every word

298
00:31:59,584 --> 00:32:04,544
You're the one I dreamt of

299
00:33:05,984 --> 00:33:10,944
You're my heart throb

300
00:33:12,323 --> 00:33:17,625
I'm your admirer

301
00:33:18,663 --> 00:33:23,623
I'm lost in the world of love

302
00:33:31,676 --> 00:33:38,639
You mean the world to me

303
00:35:14,112 --> 00:35:16,080
What did you ask for, Ravi?

304
00:35:16,781 --> 00:35:18,749
- You tell me first.
- You say it first.

305
00:35:19,617 --> 00:35:21,744
You must say it first.

306
00:35:23,621 --> 00:35:25,748
I...asked...

307
00:35:32,797 --> 00:35:34,765
Love knows no religion.

308
00:35:36,134 --> 00:35:38,102
Nor does it crave for words.

309
00:35:39,470 --> 00:35:41,768
I know what you asked for.

310
00:35:46,144 --> 00:35:48,772
You're my present
and my future as well.

311
00:35:50,148 --> 00:35:52,776
I'll follow your
footsteps blindly.

312
00:35:54,152 --> 00:35:56,780
Your destination will be
mine as well.

313
00:35:58,823 --> 00:36:00,791
I grant my love to you today.

314
00:36:13,504 --> 00:36:15,802
- Sonu!
- Say it again!

315
00:36:21,846 --> 00:36:23,814
You must address me
by that name always!

316
00:36:24,849 --> 00:36:30,481
lf you address me as Kajal, I'll
think that you've disowned me.

317
00:36:42,867 --> 00:36:44,835
Where had you been
for so long?

318
00:36:45,203 --> 00:36:47,831
I was at home as my leg
got sprained.

319
00:36:48,206 --> 00:36:50,174
- Was your leg sprained or your
heart? - I'm saying the truth.

320
00:36:51,542 --> 00:36:53,908
- But your eyes reflect
a different story. - What!?

321
00:36:58,549 --> 00:37:01,916
You're in love

322
00:37:03,221 --> 00:37:05,519
It's not fair on your part
to have forgotten us!

323
00:37:05,890 --> 00:37:08,859
- Whom are you talking about?
- Your guest will preside...

324
00:37:08,926 --> 00:37:10,860
...our Annual Function.

325
00:37:11,229 --> 00:37:13,857
And Kajal will dance
in his presence!

326
00:37:14,232 --> 00:37:16,530
- That's right. - I won't
dance in his presence.

327
00:37:16,901 --> 00:37:19,199
And why should he
be the Chief guest?

328
00:37:19,303 --> 00:37:21,203
Won't he heed to his
dear sisters-in-law?

329
00:37:21,572 --> 00:37:23,540
Won't our brother-in-law
heed to us?

330
00:37:33,251 --> 00:37:35,879
- Where were you?
- I was waiting for you.

331
00:37:38,589 --> 00:37:41,558
- Why didn't we meet earlier?
- You never thought of me so.

332
00:37:43,594 --> 00:37:46,961
My eyes reflect your love.

333
00:37:47,932 --> 00:37:50,230
- And your face.
- That's a lie.

334
00:37:50,601 --> 00:37:53,570
- How can I reside in your
eyes? - Don't you believe me?

335
00:37:54,605 --> 00:37:57,904
- Look into my eyes then!
- Oh God!

336
00:37:58,009 --> 00:37:59,567
You're right! I do
reside in your eyes.

337
00:37:59,644 --> 00:38:01,578
What sort of a magic is this?

338
00:38:01,946 --> 00:38:03,914
Initially, I too
was surprised,...

339
00:38:03,981 --> 00:38:05,915
...but I realized it the
moment I got close to you.

340
00:38:05,983 --> 00:38:09,919
In that case, we'll remain
close to each other, forever.

341
00:38:12,623 --> 00:38:14,591
Close, right!?

342
00:38:15,960 --> 00:38:17,928
What are you up to?

343
00:38:18,629 --> 00:38:20,597
Stop! Where are you
heading to?

344
00:38:20,798 --> 00:38:23,926
I won't spare you!

345
00:38:24,035 --> 00:38:25,593
- I'm trapped!
- What's the matter?

346
00:38:25,670 --> 00:38:27,262
- They're approaching us.
- Who?

347
00:38:28,639 --> 00:38:31,938
My friends are approaching us.
Please don't heed to them.

348
00:38:32,310 --> 00:38:34,608
Please refuse
to heed to them.

349
00:38:36,314 --> 00:38:38,282
She's gone!

350
00:38:40,318 --> 00:38:42,286
Our Annual function is
scheduled for today...

351
00:38:42,353 --> 00:38:45,288
...and fortunately,
you're here, so we wish...

352
00:38:45,356 --> 00:38:47,290
...that you grace
the occasion.

353
00:38:47,658 --> 00:38:50,957
- We'll be honoured!
- Actually...

354
00:38:57,001 --> 00:38:58,628
- Didn't she mention this
to you? - No!

355
00:38:59,337 --> 00:39:01,635
- Haven't you understood yet?
- How could l?

356
00:39:01,706 --> 00:39:03,970
She dances to your tunes,
doesn't she?

357
00:39:11,682 --> 00:39:13,650
Your darling is about
to arrive.

358
00:39:14,085 --> 00:39:16,053
Am I right?

359
00:39:17,021 --> 00:39:19,046
How will I dance without
my spectacles?

360
00:39:19,357 --> 00:39:21,325
I can't see him either!

361
00:39:22,026 --> 00:39:24,995
`One doctor and a
hundred patients!'

362
00:39:40,044 --> 00:39:41,671
We've been eagerly
awaiting your arrival.

363
00:39:42,046 --> 00:39:44,014
You shouldn't have entered
through the back door.

364
00:39:44,081 --> 00:39:46,015
l wanted to meet you all, first.

365
00:39:47,718 --> 00:39:49,686
I wanted to surprise you all.

366
00:39:54,892 --> 00:39:56,860
I heard that you're
a good dancer.

367
00:39:58,396 --> 00:40:02,025
But I thought you made
others dance to your tunes.

368
00:40:04,068 --> 00:40:07,037
Then I consoled myself saying
that one who makes others dance...

369
00:40:07,104 --> 00:40:09,368
...will create a sensation
by dancing herself.

370
00:40:14,078 --> 00:40:15,705
Won't you say something?

371
00:40:18,749 --> 00:40:25,382
A restless soul can rest
in peace, only when...

372
00:40:27,758 --> 00:40:29,726
When you cast a magical
spell by your dance!

373
00:40:37,101 --> 00:40:40,400
Look, your anklet
understands my language.

374
00:40:41,772 --> 00:40:43,967
But you fail to understand!

375
00:40:55,453 --> 00:40:58,752
Oh these anklets!

376
00:41:24,148 --> 00:41:27,777
Take me along, dear

377
00:41:32,156 --> 00:41:35,455
Hold my hand dear

378
00:42:03,521 --> 00:42:06,490
Oh these anklets

379
00:42:13,864 --> 00:42:18,824
Your anklets are
noisy...

380
00:42:18,903 --> 00:42:22,498
...and mesmerizing

381
00:42:24,875 --> 00:42:28,834
Oh your anklets

382
00:42:35,553 --> 00:42:41,014
My anklet sings a song

383
00:42:41,091 --> 00:42:44,026
...and draw you close to me...

384
00:43:26,604 --> 00:43:31,234
Your dream filled eyes
and your words...

385
00:43:31,609 --> 00:43:36,569
...make my day, but
disturb me during the night!

386
00:43:53,297 --> 00:43:58,257
How will I narrate
my plight to you?

387
00:43:58,335 --> 00:44:03,272
l remember not weeks,
months or years

388
00:44:03,974 --> 00:44:08,274
It's a bond of love

389
00:44:09,313 --> 00:44:13,272
The jingle of your anklets
sound like my heart beats

390
00:45:41,405 --> 00:45:46,035
My anklet bears your name

391
00:45:46,410 --> 00:45:51,370
You mean the world to me

392
00:46:07,765 --> 00:46:12,395
l wish to take the place
of these anklets...

393
00:46:12,469 --> 00:46:17,406
...and have the privilege
of adorning your feet

394
00:46:18,442 --> 00:46:22,401
l dread this sight

395
00:46:23,447 --> 00:46:27,747
I'm nervous

396
00:47:56,540 --> 00:47:58,508
Serve some steaming hot Rotis.

397
00:47:58,876 --> 00:48:01,174
- I'm coming.
- Hurry up!

398
00:48:05,215 --> 00:48:07,183
What's the matter, Kajal?

399
00:48:09,553 --> 00:48:12,181
What's the matter, Kajal?

400
00:48:12,389 --> 00:48:14,857
- Answer me!
- Did Ravi say something?

401
00:48:16,393 --> 00:48:18,361
He's leaving!

402
00:48:18,896 --> 00:48:21,194
You're responsible for
everything!

403
00:48:21,265 --> 00:48:22,857
You don't have a foresight.

404
00:48:25,569 --> 00:48:28,595
Why did he get involved with her
if he intended to cheat her?

405
00:48:29,239 --> 00:48:31,207
How will she live
in peace now?

406
00:48:33,577 --> 00:48:35,545
You consider life a stage too!

407
00:48:35,913 --> 00:48:37,881
You take life for granted.

408
00:48:38,248 --> 00:48:40,546
You don't bother about
the consequences.

409
00:48:57,935 --> 00:48:59,903
l take your leave, Devdas!

410
00:49:04,274 --> 00:49:09,576
I wanted to meet you and thank
you for all that you've done...

411
00:49:09,646 --> 00:49:11,580
...before I could leave

412
00:49:13,617 --> 00:49:15,585
I shall be indebted
to you forever!

413
00:49:15,953 --> 00:49:19,582
I'll leave now!
Kajal is not to be seen!

414
00:49:20,457 --> 00:49:22,425
- I wanted to meet her too.
- Mr. Ravi!

415
00:49:22,693 --> 00:49:24,593
What more do you have to say?
Have you come to inquire...

416
00:49:24,661 --> 00:49:27,255
...about her after
having hurt her?

417
00:49:28,465 --> 00:49:30,592
Have you come to see
whether she is heartbroken?

418
00:49:31,301 --> 00:49:33,929
Why did you make a promise when
you didn't intend to fulfil it?

419
00:49:36,306 --> 00:49:38,604
I didn't expect you to do this.

420
00:49:39,643 --> 00:49:41,611
She has been weeping
the whole night!

421
00:49:42,646 --> 00:49:45,945
Why are you punishing us
for no reason at all?

422
00:50:15,679 --> 00:50:17,647
I'll kill you!

423
00:50:28,692 --> 00:50:32,651
Uncle! Make arrangements
for our marriage.

424
00:50:33,697 --> 00:50:35,665
I shall take Sonu
along with me!

425
00:50:37,367 --> 00:50:40,666
I told you that only an artiste
can recognize another artiste.

426
00:50:41,038 --> 00:50:43,336
You suspected Ravi
unnecessarily.

427
00:50:43,407 --> 00:50:46,672
- There's lots of work to be
done. Let's go! - Let's go!

428
00:50:48,378 --> 00:50:50,676
How would I go without you?

429
00:50:52,049 --> 00:50:54,017
You seem to be
extremely happy today!

430
00:50:58,722 --> 00:51:01,691
Bangles adorn my hand!

431
00:51:01,758 --> 00:51:06,354
You must wait for
a while, dear

432
00:51:06,463 --> 00:51:10,695
- Hello Mom!
- Hello Ravi!

433
00:51:12,769 --> 00:51:14,703
- It's so long since
you left home. - I'm fine!

434
00:51:15,572 --> 00:51:21,772
I'm bringing home a gift which
will take you by surprise!

435
00:51:28,085 --> 00:51:32,044
- I'm hearing, son! - I've
got a surprise gift for you.

436
00:51:33,090 --> 00:51:35,058
It's a suspense! The lines
are bad, bye!

437
00:51:36,760 --> 00:51:38,728
I know what the gift is!
I'm your mother after all...

438
00:51:38,795 --> 00:51:41,787
...no one can understand you
better than me!

439
00:51:42,432 --> 00:51:45,731
Munshi! Prince is bringing home
a surprise gift.

440
00:52:16,800 --> 00:52:18,768
Kajal! My dear child!

441
00:52:19,803 --> 00:52:22,101
My dream has been fulfilled!

442
00:52:23,140 --> 00:52:26,439
Ravi! You must fill my dear
Kajal's life with joy!

443
00:52:39,489 --> 00:52:41,457
Welcome, daughter-in-law!

444
00:52:41,658 --> 00:52:43,785
Madam! Daughter-in-law
has arrived!

445
00:52:44,828 --> 00:52:46,796
- Don't uncover your face!
- How will I see then?

446
00:52:48,832 --> 00:52:50,800
You may look through my eyes!

447
00:52:51,835 --> 00:52:53,803
I'll shut my eyes then!

448
00:52:56,840 --> 00:52:58,808
Come!

449
00:53:15,192 --> 00:53:17,160
May God bless you!

450
00:53:29,873 --> 00:53:32,842
You've filled my life
with happiness, son!

451
00:53:33,877 --> 00:53:37,506
I wish to shower all
the wealth on you?!

452
00:53:43,220 --> 00:53:49,181
Invite one and all. Let people
witness this sight!

453
00:54:08,245 --> 00:54:10,213
Congratulations Sir!

454
00:54:11,248 --> 00:54:14,217
- What's all this?
- Prince is married!

455
00:54:14,584 --> 00:54:16,552
You won't succeed in your plan!

456
00:54:17,254 --> 00:54:21,213
You scoundrel! You gladly
announce a bad news too!

457
00:54:21,925 --> 00:54:23,893
What are you doing?
Let him go!

458
00:54:24,594 --> 00:54:26,562
People are watching!

459
00:54:31,268 --> 00:54:33,236
Look dear! I'll immerse
this ring in the water and...

460
00:54:34,304 --> 00:54:36,238
...the two of you
must try to recover it.

461
00:54:36,606 --> 00:54:39,734
One who wins this game will
be a winner all his life.

462
00:54:39,943 --> 00:54:43,572
- Try you best, son!
- I'll win, aunty!

463
00:54:43,947 --> 00:54:46,916
- Are you ready?
- Yes!

464
00:54:47,951 --> 00:54:49,919
What's this? This is unfair!

465
00:54:50,020 --> 00:54:51,988
Alright! You may play now!

466
00:54:53,290 --> 00:54:56,589
Pick it up, daughter-in-law!
Bravo! She has won!

467
00:54:59,629 --> 00:55:01,597
Congratulations!

468
00:55:02,966 --> 00:55:05,264
To you too! Welcome!

469
00:55:07,637 --> 00:55:11,266
- I'm annoyed with you!
- Annoyed!? With me?

470
00:55:11,641 --> 00:55:15,600
Of course! You've taken
a major decision...

471
00:55:15,679 --> 00:55:19,945
...without even consulting me.
You've alienated me, haven't you?

472
00:55:20,317 --> 00:55:24,014
- You're annoyance is justified
but Ravi is the culprit!

473
00:55:24,654 --> 00:55:26,952
- Bless me, uncle! - Bless him!
- God bless you, child!

474
00:55:29,326 --> 00:55:32,955
He is your uncle!
Seek his blessings!

475
00:55:36,333 --> 00:55:38,301
God bless you, child!

476
00:55:39,336 --> 00:55:41,304
May you lead
a prosperous life!

477
00:55:42,072 --> 00:55:44,632
Sister-in-law!
I'm extremely happy!

478
00:55:45,342 --> 00:55:47,310
I'm relieved!

479
00:55:51,681 --> 00:55:51,748
I wish brother was alive!

480
00:55:51,748 --> 00:55:55,980
We've endured joy
after a long span!

481
00:55:56,686 --> 00:56:00,315
Let's celebrate!
Let's have fireworks!

482
00:56:17,040 --> 00:56:22,068
I'm engrossed in your thoughts

483
00:56:23,380 --> 00:56:28,340
I'm lost in your memories

484
00:56:29,719 --> 00:56:34,679
I've entrusted my life to you

485
00:56:36,059 --> 00:56:41,019
I've accepted you

486
00:56:42,132 --> 00:56:47,035
I've accepted you

487
00:56:48,738 --> 00:56:55,701
Love happens only once

488
00:57:05,422 --> 00:57:12,726
l love only you, my dear

489
00:57:22,772 --> 00:57:29,905
l owe my life to you

490
00:57:39,122 --> 00:57:46,153
l love only you, my dear

491
00:58:00,810 --> 00:58:06,442
l love only you, my dear

492
00:58:11,988 --> 00:58:17,449
l love only you, my dear

493
00:58:20,830 --> 00:58:24,960
I wonder from where the
scoundrel has brought that scum.

494
00:58:25,168 --> 00:58:26,795
But you blessed her too, Papa!

495
00:58:28,171 --> 00:58:30,969
You blessed her with a
prosperous life, didn't you?

496
00:58:31,174 --> 00:58:34,473
One must add fuel to the
fire to keep it burning!

497
00:58:38,014 --> 00:58:42,974
The house can be set aflame
with the help of the fire!

498
00:58:45,188 --> 00:58:47,486
I too have flicked a spark
from that fire!

499
00:58:49,526 --> 00:58:52,495
All I'm waiting for, is
the right opportunity.

500
00:58:53,863 --> 00:58:58,163
All my efforts
have been futile!

501
00:58:59,536 --> 00:59:02,835
I'd planned to ruin
the entire clan.

502
00:59:03,873 --> 00:59:07,172
But they're planning
to continue with it!

503
00:59:08,545 --> 00:59:13,505
Papa! A rotten fruit
is always discarded!

504
00:59:15,218 --> 00:59:19,177
I too shall tarnish her image!

505
00:59:21,891 --> 00:59:23,859
She will be relieved of it
only after death!

506
00:59:24,227 --> 00:59:27,196
I've to send a few
documents to Mumbai,...

507
00:59:27,263 --> 00:59:30,198
...you must sign them
immediately.

508
00:59:30,900 --> 00:59:33,198
Thereafter, I'll visit
the temple.

509
00:59:34,237 --> 00:59:37,206
- Do we have to leave at once?
- Yes, I've fixed an appointment.

510
00:59:37,574 --> 00:59:39,872
But I wanted to take
Sonu to the jeweller!

511
00:59:40,076 --> 00:59:42,044
You may take her later!

512
00:59:44,581 --> 00:59:46,549
I haven't stopped you!

513
00:59:47,083 --> 00:59:49,051
I'll take you
the moment I return!

514
01:00:18,615 --> 01:00:20,583
Hello brother-in-law!

515
01:00:20,950 --> 01:00:22,918
Brother-in-law!?

516
01:00:23,620 --> 01:00:25,588
Who are you?

517
01:00:27,123 --> 01:00:29,091
Where have you come from?

518
01:00:31,127 --> 01:00:33,095
With whose permission have
you entered this home?

519
01:00:33,963 --> 01:00:35,931
Will you reign this palace?

520
01:00:37,967 --> 01:00:40,094
Will you bear a child?

521
01:00:41,638 --> 01:00:43,606
Will you bear a child?

522
01:00:47,644 --> 01:00:50,340
No one will come
to your rescue today!

523
01:00:51,648 --> 01:00:54,617
You will bear my child
and not his!

524
01:00:55,318 --> 01:00:57,286
This very moment!

525
01:01:32,488 --> 01:01:34,456
Sonu, you!

526
01:01:38,361 --> 01:01:40,329
What happened Sonu?

527
01:01:41,297 --> 01:01:43,663
Brother-in-law
misbehaved with me.

528
01:01:44,434 --> 01:01:45,458
What?!

529
01:01:48,971 --> 01:01:53,670
Till today, no one dares
to see our daughter-in-law...

530
01:01:53,743 --> 01:01:57,008
...and you tried to touch
her with your dirty hands.

531
01:01:57,714 --> 01:01:59,477
Ravi, beat him!

532
01:02:48,431 --> 01:02:50,729
Virendra Pratap,
take him from here.

533
01:02:51,434 --> 01:02:54,403
I gave shelter
to this venomous snake.

534
01:02:55,438 --> 01:02:57,736
He tried to misbehave
with our prestige,...

535
01:02:57,807 --> 01:03:02,073
...I would have killed him,
if you have not served for us.

536
01:03:03,112 --> 01:03:03,737
Take him from here.

537
01:03:04,447 --> 01:03:06,415
I should not see him
anymore in this city.

538
01:03:08,785 --> 01:03:12,551
Why did you spare this rogue?
Why?!

539
01:03:13,790 --> 01:03:15,417
Why didn't you kill him?

540
01:03:16,459 --> 01:03:18,086
How will I face the world?

541
01:03:19,462 --> 01:03:20,759
At whom mercy I was
living all my life...

542
01:03:20,830 --> 01:03:23,424
...what did you
gave them in return?

543
01:03:24,300 --> 01:03:25,426
Which family do you hail from?

544
01:03:26,469 --> 01:03:29,768
Move! Tell me.
Which family do you hail from?

545
01:03:30,473 --> 01:03:33,567
You scoundrel!
Get lost from here.

546
01:03:40,983 --> 01:03:44,282
Oh God!
How cruelly they had beaten you!

547
01:03:44,487 --> 01:03:46,455
Is this the way
to beat anyone?

548
01:03:46,522 --> 01:03:49,548
It's good that you came on the
right time or else...

549
01:03:49,625 --> 01:03:51,286
...your chapter would
have been come to an end.

550
01:03:51,360 --> 01:03:54,295
Chapter is now going
to begin, Chintamani.

551
01:03:56,332 --> 01:03:59,301
Ravi has not raised
his hand on my son.

552
01:04:00,336 --> 01:04:02,600
But he had provoked my anger.

553
01:04:03,639 --> 01:04:06,972
He had sparked the fire
which was doused.

554
01:04:08,845 --> 01:04:17,617
She was about to kill my son,
now I will ruin all her family.

555
01:04:18,855 --> 01:04:21,824
Now you can see
the real destruction.

556
01:04:21,891 --> 01:04:23,825
Please hurry. Now you
are married to me...

557
01:04:23,893 --> 01:04:25,827
...it's enough getting ready.

558
01:04:26,362 --> 01:04:28,990
Why are you in so hurry?
Your train is not going to leave.

559
01:04:29,065 --> 01:04:30,430
Take care of yourself.

560
01:04:30,533 --> 01:04:32,160
I will take good care
of myself and her too.

561
01:04:32,235 --> 01:04:33,827
I will show your daughter-in-law
our whole estates...

562
01:04:33,903 --> 01:04:34,835
...and will be back
before evening.

563
01:04:34,904 --> 01:04:36,496
- Don't worry about us.
- Okay.

564
01:04:36,572 --> 01:04:37,504
We take your leave.

565
01:04:47,550 --> 01:04:49,347
- Hello mother!
- Ravi!

566
01:04:49,418 --> 01:04:50,851
Mother, I am calling
from farm-house.

567
01:04:50,920 --> 01:04:52,854
Weather is very bad,
it's raining very heavily.

568
01:04:52,922 --> 01:04:55,516
Ravi speak louder,
I can't hear you properly.

569
01:04:55,591 --> 01:04:57,354
I am calling from farm house.

01:04:57,426 --> 01:04:59,018
Here weather is very bad,
and it's raining very heavily.

572
01:05:00,696 --> 01:05:03,187
- How is my daughter-in-law?
- She is very fine.

573
01:05:18,180 --> 01:05:20,444
Ravi, I feel very scared.

574
01:05:20,683 --> 01:05:25,985
Thank god, for this weather,
so that she will embrace me.

575
01:05:26,489 --> 01:05:28,980
- I will kill you.
- Then, come on kill me.

T ell me one thing, Sonu.

606
01:09:46,982 --> 01:09:49,416
Why do girls take
so much time to get ready?

607
01:09:49,485 --> 01:09:53,581
We men get ready very fast.
Wear shirts and pants and ready.

Come on, chase them.

Ravi, are you alright?

612

Sonu, you please go from here.
I will stop them.

613
01:10:57,820 --> 01:11:00,311
No Ravi, I can't leave you
in this condition.

01:12:24,773 --> 01:12:26,070
Father!

618
01:12:37,519 --> 01:12:41,080
Who?!
Who is there?

619
01:12:51,633 --> 01:12:55,262
Daughter-in-law, what happened?
Where is Ravi?

620
01:12:57,139 --> 01:13:00,165
Why don't you speak?
Where is Ravi?

621
01:13:01,643 --> 01:13:04,441
Speak dear!
I am asking you where is Ravi?

622
01:13:05,147 --> 01:13:08,605
Killed him.
Everyone killed him.

623
01:13:10,152 --> 01:13:11,119
Yes.

624
01:13:11,820 --> 01:13:15,722
Are you in your senses?
Do you know what are you talking?

625
01:13:15,791 --> 01:13:17,281
Are you in your senses, dear?

626
01:13:35,177 --> 01:13:39,807
No, Ravi.
You can't leave me and go.

627
01:13:39,882 --> 01:13:43,147
You can't!
You can't leave me and go.

628
01:13:46,455 --> 01:13:49,754
Oh god, you can't do this to me.

629
01:13:50,192 --> 01:13:54,151
Don't you feel pity to
snatch a widow's son?

630
01:13:54,696 --> 01:13:59,156
You should bring my son alive.
You should!

631
01:13:59,701 --> 01:14:04,161
See!
She is just got married.

632
01:14:04,873 --> 01:14:08,673
She hasn't seen her
married life.

633
01:14:10,712 --> 01:14:12,179
O my dear!

634
01:14:30,032 --> 01:14:33,195
You sinner! Do you
think that you can escape?

635
01:14:34,036 --> 01:14:37,199
I will say the
truth to the world.

636
01:14:39,241 --> 01:14:45,202
You can only say when you can
escape from this palace.

637
01:14:46,248 --> 01:14:49,217
I have just seen my
son's corpse.

638
01:14:50,586 --> 01:14:53,384
This palace has
seen many celebrations.

639
01:14:53,755 --> 01:14:55,382
Many celebrations!

640
01:14:55,924 --> 01:14:59,223
It will face a downfall too.

641
01:14:59,761 --> 01:15:01,729
There will be a disaster.

642
01:15:02,431 --> 01:15:05,889
I will light your pyre.

643
01:15:08,070 --> 01:15:09,401
Take them and lock them.

644
01:15:10,272 --> 01:15:14,732
Virendra Pratap, remember one thing
one can't escape from God.

645
01:15:14,810 --> 01:15:17,244
One day you will pay
for your sins.

646
01:15:17,346 --> 01:15:19,246
You will pay for all your sins.

647
01:15:51,480 --> 01:15:54,278
Pardon me, sister-in-law.
Forgive me.

648
01:15:54,483 --> 01:15:56,280
Forgive me!

649
01:15:56,652 --> 01:16:01,089
Lust of money got me
involved in this sins.

650
01:16:01,323 --> 01:16:03,791
But, they will kill him...

651
01:16:03,859 --> 01:16:07,955
...I didn't expect that
they will kill the prince.

652
01:16:08,330 --> 01:16:11,299
What had happened
sister-in-law?

653
01:16:18,340 --> 01:16:20,308
Hurry up.

654
01:16:20,676 --> 01:16:24,635
Let's escape from this city
before any calamity happens.

655
01:16:24,713 --> 01:16:25,907
Hurry up.

656
01:16:26,014 --> 01:16:27,311
Come on, daughter-in-law.
Come on.

657
01:16:27,416 --> 01:16:29,475
We will go far
away from this city.

658
01:16:39,361 --> 01:16:41,659
Search every nook and corner.

659
01:16:42,864 --> 01:16:48,131
That three lives
shouldn't escape.

660
01:17:01,550 --> 01:17:05,145
Sister-in-law, this big
tragedy had happened...

661
01:17:05,887 --> 01:17:08,151
...and you didn't inform me?

662
01:17:08,390 --> 01:17:13,157
What to tell Sharmaji,
Our ancestors palace has ruined.

663
01:17:14,396 --> 01:17:17,160
You trusted
Virendra Pratap blindly.

664
01:17:17,399 --> 01:17:20,630
What would I have done?
Ravi was a child that time.

665
01:17:21,203 --> 01:17:26,038
I thought that he will take
the responsibility when he grow up?

666
01:17:26,408 --> 01:17:29,866
But...
Time snatched my son from me?

667
01:17:31,413 --> 01:17:32,880
Don't worry, sister-in-law.

668
01:17:33,415 --> 01:17:36,145
I will have Virendra Pratap
punish for his sins.

669
01:17:36,218 --> 01:17:39,551
No, brother. I've to protect
whatever I'm left with.

670
01:17:41,923 --> 01:17:45,723
Remember one thing,
that you are not alone.

671
01:17:46,428 --> 01:17:47,895
I am there to help you.

672
01:18:04,946 --> 01:18:08,746
l laughed a lot. See, tears
have come in my eyes.

673
01:18:08,850 --> 01:18:10,909
These are not merely tears,
they are tears of joy...

674
01:18:11,253 --> 01:18:13,744
...that are shining like
dew on your cheeks.

675
01:18:17,459 --> 01:18:19,427
You are my life.

676
01:18:19,628 --> 01:18:21,926
Ravi, I am feeling scared.

677
01:18:21,997 --> 01:18:27,230
Thank god, for this weather,
for bringing her close to me.
