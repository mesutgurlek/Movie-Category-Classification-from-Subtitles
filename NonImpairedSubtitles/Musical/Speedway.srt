1
00:00:24,613 --> 00:00:28,128
Twelve minutes to race time.
I didn't realize it was so...

2
00:00:28,213 --> 00:00:29,931
- Just relax.
- Let go!

3
00:00:33,093 --> 00:00:35,891
- What are you doing with my date?
- Your date?

4
00:00:36,213 --> 00:00:39,285
I thought she was my date.
No wonder you were so uncooperative.

5
00:00:39,373 --> 00:00:40,726
- Out!
- I like your taste.

6
00:00:40,813 --> 00:00:42,087
Out!

7
00:00:44,133 --> 00:00:45,361
Bye.

8
00:00:46,933 --> 00:00:49,766
I have to change.
It'll only take a few seconds.

9
00:00:52,133 --> 00:00:55,045
- Who was he?
- That was Kenny, my manager.

10
00:00:55,133 --> 00:00:56,361
Some manager!

11
00:00:56,453 --> 00:00:59,570
The minute I walked in here,
he grabbed me and started kissing me.

12
00:00:59,653 --> 00:01:01,689
Don't worry about Kenny. He's harmless.

13
00:01:01,773 --> 00:01:04,287
Yes, if you're 6'4" and a karate expert.

14
00:01:04,893 --> 00:01:07,043
How can a guy like that be your manager?

15
00:01:07,133 --> 00:01:09,931
I go back a long way with Kenny,
ever since we were kids.

16
00:01:10,013 --> 00:01:13,642
Neither one of us ever had very much.
Whatever he had, we split.

17
00:01:16,253 --> 00:01:18,926
Now he works for me,
handles my business...

18
00:01:19,013 --> 00:01:22,164
takes care of all my endorsements
and all my money.

19
00:01:22,253 --> 00:01:24,403
You mean,
you let him take care of your money?

20
00:01:24,493 --> 00:01:26,961
Why not? I like to live dangerously.

21
00:01:27,053 --> 00:01:30,409
- Does that go for girls, too?
- That goes for everything.

22
00:01:30,773 --> 00:01:33,207
Honey, I'm gonna leave the driving to you.

23
00:01:38,213 --> 00:01:41,125
- I wanted to see if it was the same girl.
- It's the same girl.

24
00:01:41,213 --> 00:01:43,169
There's a drivers' meeting
in eight minutes.

25
00:01:43,253 --> 00:01:46,290
- You're gonna be late.
- Eight minutes. Oh, no!

26
00:01:46,973 --> 00:01:49,282
- She really had 10.
- Good move.

27
00:01:54,693 --> 00:01:57,810
A new track, a new girl.
You certainly get the goodies, don't you?

28
00:01:57,893 --> 00:02:00,566
It was a chance meeting. I followed her.

29
00:04:01,933 --> 00:04:03,525
Good afternoon, race fans...

30
00:04:03,613 --> 00:04:05,683
and welcome
to Charlotte Motor Speedway...

31
00:04:05,773 --> 00:04:08,890
where we'll soon be underway
with the Charlotte 100...

32
00:04:08,973 --> 00:04:12,568
first place paying $7,500.

33
00:04:12,653 --> 00:04:16,248
The pits are buzzing with
the last-minute checks of everything...

34
00:04:18,853 --> 00:04:20,127
Back to the car wash.

35
00:04:20,213 --> 00:04:21,805
- How you doing, Birdie?
- Hi, Stevie.

36
00:04:21,893 --> 00:04:23,565
- Want a chip?
- No, thanks.

37
00:04:25,133 --> 00:04:26,691
She's purring like a fat cat.

38
00:04:26,773 --> 00:04:30,129
She'll run like a lean one,
because I'm going flat-out today.

39
00:04:31,813 --> 00:04:35,328
- Want to wish you luck.
- All bad? At least you're consistent.

40
00:04:35,413 --> 00:04:37,324
- Good luck.
- Yeah, same to you.

41
00:04:38,493 --> 00:04:40,370
Clear the midway.

42
00:04:40,573 --> 00:04:43,212
Remember, everyone must remain
behind the pit wall...

43
00:04:43,293 --> 00:04:44,885
except the regular crew.

44
00:04:45,413 --> 00:04:48,211
- Run over 'em, Paul.
- Sic 'em, tiger.

45
00:04:49,573 --> 00:04:52,167
The weather is perfect,
and the track is fast.

46
00:04:52,253 --> 00:04:54,892
You can feel the excitement in the air.

47
00:04:56,213 --> 00:04:58,681
Gentlemen, start your engines.

48
00:05:12,653 --> 00:05:14,006
You ain't got a chance.

49
00:05:14,373 --> 00:05:15,726
Fans, here we go.

50
00:05:22,053 --> 00:05:24,283
And here's your leader at the moment...

51
00:05:24,373 --> 00:05:27,331
Miss Mary Ann Ashman,
Miss Charlotte Speedway 100.

52
00:05:28,613 --> 00:05:32,447
All cars in their proper position,
as we travel around on the pace lap.

53
00:05:39,053 --> 00:05:41,487
...traveling around
at about 75 miles per hour...

54
00:05:41,573 --> 00:05:43,609
giving all the cars a chance to warm up...

55
00:05:43,693 --> 00:05:47,003
and for drivers to check any bugs
before we get underway.

56
00:05:48,413 --> 00:05:50,643
A final wave from Miss Charlotte 100.

57
00:05:52,973 --> 00:05:56,409
The pace car heading down
under the apron.

58
00:05:56,493 --> 00:06:00,202
Here they come out of the far turn,
down the main straightaway.

59
00:06:03,373 --> 00:06:05,967
There's the green flag and they're racing!

60
00:06:14,973 --> 00:06:17,771
Number 42 has moved into third.

61
00:06:17,853 --> 00:06:21,084
/t's still a race for first and second.
Here's the rundown.

62
00:06:21,173 --> 00:06:23,687
Number 21 your leader, Cale Yarborough.

63
00:06:23,773 --> 00:06:26,685
Running second,
Car Number 42, Tiny Lund.

64
00:06:26,773 --> 00:06:28,684
/n third place, the 17 car.

65
00:06:28,773 --> 00:06:31,924
Moving into fourth spot,
Steve Grayson in Car Number 6.

66
00:06:32,013 --> 00:06:35,369
Right on his tail for fifth spot,
Paul Dado in Car Number 43.

67
00:06:35,973 --> 00:06:38,441
/t's still a three-way go for first place.

68
00:06:39,173 --> 00:06:41,403
The 17 car is starting to slow down.

69
00:06:41,493 --> 00:06:44,007
And here comes Grayson
to take over third.

70
00:06:44,333 --> 00:06:46,972
Paul Dado rises to take the fourth spot.

71
00:06:52,893 --> 00:06:55,851
The 21 car into the pit
with a blown engine.

72
00:06:58,573 --> 00:07:01,770
Grayson in the second spot,
and Paul Dado running third.

73
00:07:10,173 --> 00:07:13,609
Look at this. The leader, Tiny Lund,
heading for the fifth.

74
00:07:13,893 --> 00:07:16,930
Now it's a race for first spot
between Grayson and Dado.

75
00:07:17,293 --> 00:07:19,807
Through the far turn they go,
right together.

76
00:07:19,893 --> 00:07:22,168
Steve Grayson holding down the lead.

77
00:07:23,773 --> 00:07:24,922
Come on!

78
00:07:39,173 --> 00:07:40,765
Paul Dado in Car Number 43...

79
00:07:40,853 --> 00:07:44,163
starting to move on the leader,
Car Number 6, Steve Grayson.

80
00:07:45,413 --> 00:07:49,406
Side by side they go!
This has been going on for the last 36 laps.

81
00:07:49,493 --> 00:07:52,087
Dado pulling away to take over the lead!

82
00:08:00,173 --> 00:08:04,564
Down into the infield, the 76 car,
taking the 80 car with it.

83
00:08:04,893 --> 00:08:06,565
Both drivers are okay.

84
00:08:14,093 --> 00:08:17,881
Paul Dado, holding down the first spot.
Grayson holding on for second.

85
00:08:20,053 --> 00:08:22,283
Grayson's staying right with him.

86
00:08:23,973 --> 00:08:26,248
Here they come,
down in front of the grandstand.

87
00:08:26,333 --> 00:08:28,130
Grayson's pouring it on.

88
00:08:28,813 --> 00:08:31,611
Down on the inside.
They're right together.

89
00:08:31,733 --> 00:08:33,724
You could throw a blanket
over both of them.

90
00:08:33,853 --> 00:08:35,491
The heat is on.

91
00:08:38,253 --> 00:08:40,403
Grayson pulling ahead in the 6 car.

92
00:08:50,973 --> 00:08:54,090
Here's Paul Dado trying to make up time.

93
00:08:57,293 --> 00:08:59,011
Paul Dado in Car Number 43.

94
00:08:59,093 --> 00:09:01,926
And here comes Dado.
Look at this boy go!

95
00:09:02,013 --> 00:09:03,765
Closing fast on the leader.

96
00:09:07,093 --> 00:09:09,653
Out of the turn,
Paul Dado has closed the gap.

97
00:09:09,733 --> 00:09:12,042
He's right on the bumper of the leader.

98
00:09:17,933 --> 00:09:18,968
Come on, Stevie.

99
00:09:21,253 --> 00:09:24,290
Now they're side by side.
The duel is on for first spot.

100
00:09:24,653 --> 00:09:26,644
How long can they keep this up?

101
00:09:32,853 --> 00:09:34,969
It's been going on lap after lap.

102
00:09:35,093 --> 00:09:39,132
Dado the hard way, around the outside.
Grayson pulling right back up again.

103
00:09:40,933 --> 00:09:43,686
A beautiful job of driving
by both of these drivers.

104
00:09:43,773 --> 00:09:46,207
Out of the far turn they go,
Grayson the leader.

105
00:09:46,293 --> 00:09:49,365
The 19 car has lost it in Turn Number 4.

106
00:09:55,333 --> 00:09:57,449
Here's the leader,
down the main straightaway.

107
00:09:57,533 --> 00:09:59,012
The white flag is going out.

108
00:09:59,093 --> 00:10:00,367
One more lap to go!

109
00:10:07,293 --> 00:10:10,649
Paul Dado takes the flag
and chases it all the way around.

110
00:10:10,733 --> 00:10:13,486
They're going to race for it,
right to the flag.

111
00:10:17,573 --> 00:10:19,370
Birdie, look at his tires!

112
00:10:19,573 --> 00:10:23,122
There's smoke pouring out
of the wheels of the 6 car.

113
00:10:23,373 --> 00:10:26,410
This could be the end for Steve Grayson.
His tires.

114
00:10:26,493 --> 00:10:28,643
He's chunking rubber
all over the racetrack.

115
00:10:32,213 --> 00:10:36,604
Car Number 43 is right on top of him.
There's smoke pouring out of the 6 car!

116
00:10:38,413 --> 00:10:41,610
In front of the grandstand,
the checkered flag coming out!

117
00:10:42,173 --> 00:10:44,323
And Steve Grayson earns the victory!

118
00:10:53,693 --> 00:10:56,207
Man, looked like
he was really gonna bend his racer.

119
00:10:56,293 --> 00:10:59,205
That was hairy.
Thought he'd be smoked out for good!

120
00:10:59,413 --> 00:11:02,962
I prayed to every patron saint in the book.
I made some up, too.

121
00:11:03,453 --> 00:11:05,921
And from here, race fans,
he looks all right.

122
00:11:06,053 --> 00:11:09,090
What a great race!
You'll never see any better than this.

123
00:11:09,173 --> 00:11:12,324
Here's the first three positions
as they came across the line:

124
00:11:12,413 --> 00:11:16,884
Grayson, the winner, in Car Number 6.
Second to Paul Dado in the 43 car.

125
00:11:17,053 --> 00:11:18,964
Finishing in third spot, Car Number 3.

126
00:11:19,053 --> 00:11:21,283
- You had me scared.
- What happened? You all right?

127
00:11:21,373 --> 00:11:24,331
I'm still taking an inventory.
I think everything's still here.

128
00:11:24,413 --> 00:11:26,927
You had as much right winning
as the man in the moon.

129
00:11:27,013 --> 00:11:30,130
You were way over your head,
chunking tires all over the place.

130
00:11:30,213 --> 00:11:31,885
You should've been black-flagged off.

131
00:11:31,973 --> 00:11:35,329
Don't tell the officials till I get my check.
They might disqualify me.

132
00:11:35,413 --> 00:11:37,165
Now, in the winner's circle...

133
00:11:37,253 --> 00:11:39,721
waiting for Steve Grayson,
Miss Charlotte 100...

134
00:11:39,813 --> 00:11:41,166
Mary Ann Ashman...

135
00:11:41,253 --> 00:11:44,404
along with Hunter McCabe,
making the presentation.

136
00:11:45,813 --> 00:11:50,284
It's my pleasure to welcome the winner
of the Charlotte 100, Mr. Steve Grayson.

137
00:11:54,933 --> 00:11:56,810
This is Mary Ann Ashman...

138
00:11:56,893 --> 00:11:59,361
our beautiful
Miss Charlotte Speedway 100.

139
00:11:59,453 --> 00:12:01,603
- How do you do?
- Mr. Grayson.

140
00:12:02,053 --> 00:12:04,965
Mary Ann will present you
with the winner's trophy.

141
00:12:05,053 --> 00:12:06,202
Thank you.

142
00:12:06,293 --> 00:12:09,365
I hope you don't mind kissing each other,
just for the newspapers.

143
00:12:09,453 --> 00:12:11,489
Not at all, if it's all right with you.

144
00:12:11,573 --> 00:12:13,609
Well, if it's for the newspapers.

145
00:12:20,053 --> 00:12:23,045
Just in case the newspapers
didn't get a good picture.

146
00:12:34,253 --> 00:12:35,606
Come in.

147
00:12:39,413 --> 00:12:40,448
Hello?

148
00:12:52,453 --> 00:12:53,727
Oh, brother!

149
00:12:56,853 --> 00:12:58,525
Is anybody home?

150
00:13:07,773 --> 00:13:11,049
- Hello?
- This is Susan. He won again.

151
00:13:11,493 --> 00:13:13,961
$7,700, including lap money.

152
00:13:14,453 --> 00:13:16,683
My, how interesting!

153
00:13:17,053 --> 00:13:21,251
- It's certainly all adding up, isn't it?
- Yes. First place again.

154
00:13:21,693 --> 00:13:24,685
- He's a real hot dog.
- "Hot dog"? What does that mean?

155
00:13:25,373 --> 00:13:27,489
Just a little race talk I picked up.

156
00:13:27,573 --> 00:13:31,452
You're not there to pick up
whatever it is you're picking up.

157
00:13:31,573 --> 00:13:32,608
Yes, sir.

158
00:13:32,973 --> 00:13:35,771
Give me the number where you are,
in case I need to call.

159
00:13:35,853 --> 00:13:38,208
I can't do that.
I'm calling from their trailer.

160
00:13:38,293 --> 00:13:41,171
Their trailer? What if they find you there?

161
00:13:41,253 --> 00:13:42,732
I think they'd love it.

162
00:13:42,813 --> 00:13:44,531
Stevie, I've got an idea.

163
00:13:44,613 --> 00:13:47,446
- Is it good or bad?
- I'll call you again tomorrow.

164
00:13:48,733 --> 00:13:52,089
Really, what you ought to do
is lie down and get yourself a good rest.

165
00:13:52,173 --> 00:13:53,891
I do feel a little beat.

166
00:13:59,933 --> 00:14:01,412
On second thought...

167
00:14:01,533 --> 00:14:04,684
you really ought to stay outside.
Get yourself a lot of fresh air.

168
00:14:04,773 --> 00:14:07,333
That's just what I need, a lot of fresh air.

169
00:14:10,613 --> 00:14:12,410
- Hello!
- Hello.

170
00:14:14,373 --> 00:14:16,728
- Goodbye.
- Wait, I saw her first.

171
00:14:16,813 --> 00:14:19,122
- Bye-bye.
- Why can't I stay? I'm over 21.

172
00:14:19,213 --> 00:14:20,931
Sometimes I doubt it.

173
00:14:24,773 --> 00:14:27,333
- Where did you come from?
- I rang the bell.

174
00:14:27,973 --> 00:14:30,533
A voice said, "Come in," so here I am.

175
00:14:30,773 --> 00:14:33,492
- That was quite a race you won today.
- Thank you.

176
00:14:33,573 --> 00:14:35,848
You've been in the money now 20 races.

177
00:14:36,373 --> 00:14:41,003
More or less. A pretty girl like you
didn't come here just to talk about racing.

178
00:14:45,933 --> 00:14:47,207
He didn't.

179
00:14:49,773 --> 00:14:51,923
- Oh, no.
- Surprised?

180
00:14:52,293 --> 00:14:56,286
Wait a minute. I know what you think.
But I didn't suggest it. It was his own idea.

181
00:14:56,373 --> 00:14:58,250
- Of course.
- You've got to believe me.

182
00:14:58,333 --> 00:14:59,891
Obviously, I do.

183
00:14:59,973 --> 00:15:02,965
- Sometimes I think he's five years old.
- Open the door.

184
00:15:03,053 --> 00:15:07,126
Sure, I'll open it, and you're free to go.
I've got a key right...

185
00:15:08,573 --> 00:15:10,803
I got a key somewhere.

186
00:15:11,773 --> 00:15:14,048
It's in my other pants.

187
00:15:14,133 --> 00:15:16,601
You wait right here. I'll be right back.

188
00:15:24,773 --> 00:15:26,365
See? I knew I'd find it.

189
00:15:26,453 --> 00:15:29,445
I'll unlock the door,
and you're perfectly free to...

190
00:15:32,453 --> 00:15:33,568
Gone.

191
00:16:10,013 --> 00:16:12,481
Okay, everybody. Regroup.

192
00:16:16,893 --> 00:16:19,248
It's entertainment time
here at The Hangout...

193
00:16:19,333 --> 00:16:20,766
and you all know the rules.

194
00:16:20,853 --> 00:16:24,368
When I hit you with the light,
you gotta get up and do something.

195
00:16:26,693 --> 00:16:29,287
If you don't, we do something to you.

196
00:16:29,373 --> 00:16:31,125
I'm gonna go last...

197
00:16:31,213 --> 00:16:33,044
because nobody can follow me.

198
00:16:34,813 --> 00:16:37,566
Okay with the horns. I can take a hint.

199
00:16:37,733 --> 00:16:39,803
- You're on!
- No, wait a minute. Hold it.

200
00:16:39,893 --> 00:16:42,088
I don't want to... Wait a minute.

201
00:16:42,173 --> 00:16:43,925
Okay, all right.

202
00:19:47,613 --> 00:19:51,083
- I see a man coming into your life.
- Do you see him leaving, too?

203
00:19:51,173 --> 00:19:53,971
No, there's no window to sneak through,
like some people do.

204
00:19:54,053 --> 00:19:55,042
No, he doesn't leave.

205
00:19:55,133 --> 00:19:58,409
He peers into the crystal ball
and tries to think what to say next.

206
00:19:58,493 --> 00:19:59,972
How about "goodbye"?

207
00:20:00,253 --> 00:20:03,802
That's too old-fashioned.
Don't you have any imagination, Miss...

208
00:20:09,773 --> 00:20:11,252
Now concentrate.

209
00:20:11,813 --> 00:20:13,883
Keep your eyes on the watch.

210
00:20:14,093 --> 00:20:15,492
Watch the watch.

211
00:20:17,253 --> 00:20:19,972
Your eyes are getting very heavy.

212
00:20:20,293 --> 00:20:22,363
They weigh about 3 pounds each.

213
00:20:23,173 --> 00:20:25,084
You want to tell me your name.

214
00:20:26,453 --> 00:20:29,411
- What is your name?
- This is getting ridiculous.

215
00:20:30,733 --> 00:20:33,566
You're fighting me.
Let's get back to the watch.

216
00:20:33,653 --> 00:20:35,325
Watch the watch.

217
00:20:47,093 --> 00:20:49,368
- Bottoms up.
- Wait a minute.

218
00:20:49,853 --> 00:20:53,084
- When will I see you again?
- Ask your crystal helmet.

219
00:21:01,693 --> 00:21:04,253
Kenny, how about assisting me
with one of my tricks.

220
00:21:04,333 --> 00:21:07,564
- No, thanks. I have a little trick of my own.
- You're cute.

221
00:21:07,653 --> 00:21:09,484
It will only take a minute.

222
00:21:09,733 --> 00:21:11,052
So will mine.

223
00:22:01,613 --> 00:22:04,002
Trying to get away
with the mustard, too, fella?

224
00:22:04,093 --> 00:22:07,483
- "Too"?
- Ain't it enough you ate six hot dogs?

225
00:22:07,573 --> 00:22:09,086
Six hot dogs?

226
00:22:12,013 --> 00:22:14,686
I really enjoyed them, too, pal.
There you go.

227
00:22:29,853 --> 00:22:31,445
Come and get it.

228
00:22:40,773 --> 00:22:42,684
That smells good.

229
00:22:44,333 --> 00:22:47,006
I'm hungry. I'm starving.

230
00:22:47,853 --> 00:22:50,128
I'm more starving than you are.

231
00:22:50,213 --> 00:22:51,851
Where'd you get this stuff?

232
00:22:51,933 --> 00:22:54,925
I borrowed it from the cook
when he wasn't looking.

233
00:22:56,173 --> 00:22:58,209
Six hot dogs...

234
00:22:59,053 --> 00:23:00,771
potato chips...

235
00:23:02,813 --> 00:23:06,362
coleslaw, three colas...

236
00:23:07,893 --> 00:23:09,485
one diet.

237
00:23:10,733 --> 00:23:13,691
Six hot dogs is $1.50.

238
00:23:13,973 --> 00:23:16,009
Pop, they're the giant size.

239
00:23:16,493 --> 00:23:19,007
Six giant hot dogs.

240
00:23:19,093 --> 00:23:22,244
That's $1.90.

241
00:23:22,733 --> 00:23:25,201
- We don't wanna cheat anybody.
- No, Pop.

242
00:23:25,533 --> 00:23:29,128
- I'll just add these up now.
- You forgot the mustard.

243
00:23:30,893 --> 00:23:33,088
- Hi there, Mr. Grayson.
- Hi, Abel.

244
00:23:33,773 --> 00:23:35,126
So I did.

245
00:23:35,853 --> 00:23:38,208
It looks a little less than half-full.

246
00:23:38,293 --> 00:23:41,046
I'd calculate about 13 and a half cents.

247
00:23:41,293 --> 00:23:45,081
I saw you run today, Mr. Grayson.
You looked like Jack the Bear.

248
00:23:45,533 --> 00:23:47,842
It kind of reminds me
of when I was driving.

249
00:23:47,933 --> 00:23:50,493
I'll be out there again
as soon as my leg comes around.

250
00:23:50,573 --> 00:23:53,371
You stay off the track.
I got enough competition as it is.

251
00:23:53,453 --> 00:23:54,806
Go on, now.

252
00:23:54,893 --> 00:23:58,647
Ellie, I want you
to take this over to the cook, honey.

253
00:23:58,733 --> 00:24:00,963
That's okay. It's been taken care of.

254
00:24:01,053 --> 00:24:03,647
Mr. Grayson,
you shouldn't have paid for it.

255
00:24:03,733 --> 00:24:07,043
But, as long as you did,
I'll just sign this over to you.

256
00:24:07,293 --> 00:24:08,567
What is that?

257
00:24:08,653 --> 00:24:12,362
This here is a promissory note for $4.32...

258
00:24:12,453 --> 00:24:13,852
plus 6% interest.

259
00:24:13,933 --> 00:24:18,165
That's for the food we took, including
the half bottle of mustard and a diet cola.

260
00:24:18,253 --> 00:24:21,370
- Yeah, well, okay.
- All right, we can eat now.

261
00:24:21,453 --> 00:24:22,727
Excuse me.

262
00:24:24,213 --> 00:24:26,363
You got a bunch of hungry kids, Abel.

263
00:24:26,453 --> 00:24:28,648
Well, things have been a little slow, lately.

264
00:24:28,733 --> 00:24:31,611
I try to keep them fed
and a roof over their head.

265
00:24:31,933 --> 00:24:33,286
Let's sit down.

266
00:24:34,413 --> 00:24:37,291
The car won't start, so we're living in it.

267
00:24:37,693 --> 00:24:41,322
- "Make the best of life," is our motto.
- You're doing a fine job.

268
00:24:41,413 --> 00:24:43,290
They may even vote you
Mother of the Year.

269
00:24:43,373 --> 00:24:45,091
- You think so?
- Sure.

270
00:24:46,293 --> 00:24:47,567
Mr. Grayson.

271
00:24:48,693 --> 00:24:50,570
Gee, you shouldn't have done that...

272
00:24:50,653 --> 00:24:53,565
but I'm glad you did,
on account of the girls.

273
00:24:53,853 --> 00:24:57,607
Tell you what.
I'm going to write you an IOU for the $60.

274
00:24:57,973 --> 00:24:59,167
Let's see...

275
00:24:59,253 --> 00:25:03,531
"IOU $60," plus 8% interest.

276
00:25:03,613 --> 00:25:06,923
- 8%?
- When it's cash, we raise the rates.

277
00:25:08,413 --> 00:25:10,244
- Mr. Grayson?
- Steve.

278
00:25:10,333 --> 00:25:12,722
- Mr. Steve?
- Ellie wants to talk to you.

279
00:25:14,613 --> 00:25:16,569
Will you stay for supper?

280
00:25:17,773 --> 00:25:18,808
There you go.

281
00:25:18,893 --> 00:25:20,849
I'll give you the biggest part
of my hot dog.

282
00:25:20,933 --> 00:25:23,163
Don't bend it. I'll just take a bite.

283
00:25:24,813 --> 00:25:26,690
We'll have a lollipop for dessert.

284
00:25:26,773 --> 00:25:29,970
I've got a half one hidden.
We'll all take a lick.

285
00:25:30,053 --> 00:25:31,930
That's the best hot dog I ever tasted.

286
00:25:32,013 --> 00:25:34,322
I hate to eat and run,
but I don't eat dessert.

287
00:25:34,413 --> 00:25:36,369
So you can have my lick, okay?

288
00:25:37,253 --> 00:25:38,447
- Bye.
- Bye.

289
00:25:38,533 --> 00:25:39,932
Bye, everybody.

290
00:25:41,253 --> 00:25:43,448
- What's your name?
- Come on. Not me.

291
00:25:43,533 --> 00:25:44,932
- Yeah, you.
- Oh, no.

292
00:25:45,013 --> 00:25:46,651
Come on, rules are rules.

293
00:25:47,973 --> 00:25:49,611
Go out there and wail.

294
00:28:37,493 --> 00:28:39,211
Marvelous, just marvelous.

295
00:28:42,733 --> 00:28:46,169
See what you can do if you try?
Okay, everybody, let's dance.

296
00:28:46,253 --> 00:28:49,051
Choose your partners and then forget 'em.

297
00:28:49,253 --> 00:28:50,447
Hit it.

298
00:29:05,893 --> 00:29:08,009
- You're good.
- Thank you.

299
00:29:08,093 --> 00:29:10,448
While we're dancing,
maybe we can think up a duet.

300
00:29:10,533 --> 00:29:12,728
No, I'm sorry. Someone's waiting.

301
00:29:12,813 --> 00:29:13,928
Who?

302
00:29:14,373 --> 00:29:16,250
- Excuse me.
- Him!

303
00:29:16,893 --> 00:29:18,963
- Paul?
- Yes, Paul.

304
00:29:19,653 --> 00:29:20,722
Bye.

305
00:29:24,893 --> 00:29:27,407
That's the first time
Dado's beat your time all year.

306
00:29:27,493 --> 00:29:31,327
He hasn't got the checkered flag, yet.
There's an old station wagon outside.

307
00:29:31,413 --> 00:29:34,246
Esterlake's? I worked on it
for two hours this afternoon.

308
00:29:34,333 --> 00:29:36,130
They should make a floor lamp out of it.

309
00:29:36,213 --> 00:29:37,532
- That bad?
- The worst.

310
00:29:37,613 --> 00:29:39,205
Where's Kenny?

311
00:29:39,493 --> 00:29:42,087
He trapped somebody in the trailer.
Real nice.

312
00:29:46,973 --> 00:29:48,531
That tickles, silly.

313
00:29:49,933 --> 00:29:53,767
Yes, but everything is perfect:
The night, the mood, and the girl.

314
00:29:53,853 --> 00:29:55,764
And, oh, what a girl.

315
00:29:56,693 --> 00:29:57,842
Gee.

316
00:29:58,853 --> 00:30:00,411
Especially the girl.

317
00:30:00,813 --> 00:30:02,166
She's moonlight...

318
00:30:02,253 --> 00:30:04,244
she's quicksilver...

319
00:30:04,333 --> 00:30:07,882
she's radiant and lovely,
and most of all, she's desirable.

320
00:30:07,973 --> 00:30:10,328
I think I better go. It's getting late.

321
00:30:13,093 --> 00:30:15,084
But it's only 10:30.

322
00:30:18,733 --> 00:30:19,961
Look.

323
00:30:21,413 --> 00:30:23,847
I better go. You don't mind?

324
00:30:23,933 --> 00:30:26,322
Of course I don't mind.

325
00:30:26,613 --> 00:30:29,730
Why, I wouldn't even want you
to stay here...

326
00:30:29,813 --> 00:30:31,769
unless you wanted to.

327
00:30:32,013 --> 00:30:35,289
It must be a decision
of your own free will and accord.

328
00:30:35,373 --> 00:30:36,965
You're really very nice.

329
00:30:37,333 --> 00:30:41,531
Most fellows wouldn't be so considerate.
They generally fight me.

330
00:30:42,853 --> 00:30:44,730
I never thought you'd be so...

331
00:30:47,013 --> 00:30:48,446
What's that?

332
00:30:48,973 --> 00:30:52,488
I don't know. We'll just have to
turn on the radio and find out.

333
00:30:54,373 --> 00:30:57,365
Ladies and gentlemen,
this is an emergency broadcast.

334
00:30:57,613 --> 00:31:01,162
Attention! All the wild animals in the zoo
have broken loose.

335
00:31:02,493 --> 00:31:04,927
They are roaming the streets of our city.

336
00:31:05,013 --> 00:31:06,651
Stay where you are!

337
00:31:08,693 --> 00:31:10,649
Well, good night.

338
00:31:10,733 --> 00:31:12,689
- Good night?
- Yes, I thought you were going.

339
00:31:12,773 --> 00:31:15,731
- I couldn't go out there.
- Don't you have to go home?

340
00:31:15,973 --> 00:31:18,487
Couldn't I stay here, please?

341
00:31:19,133 --> 00:31:22,011
- Is that your decision?
- Oh, yes.

342
00:31:22,093 --> 00:31:24,732
- Of your own free will?
- Yes.

343
00:31:31,773 --> 00:31:32,967
Look!

344
00:31:36,253 --> 00:31:37,322
Save me!

345
00:31:39,613 --> 00:31:42,446
You're so strong. Please save me.

346
00:31:42,533 --> 00:31:45,331
- Don't let them in.
- I'm not going to let them in.

347
00:31:45,533 --> 00:31:47,524
Save me. I know you will.

348
00:31:49,813 --> 00:31:53,123
- Don't let them in here.
- I'm not going to let them in here.

349
00:31:53,853 --> 00:31:55,730
Close the door! Don't let the animals in.

350
00:31:55,813 --> 00:31:58,486
- What animals?
- The animals that escaped from the zoo.

351
00:31:58,573 --> 00:32:02,202
- Animals that escaped from what zoo?
- The wild ones. The mean ones.

352
00:32:02,293 --> 00:32:04,011
- Didn't you hear the radio?
- What radio?

353
00:32:04,093 --> 00:32:08,086
- You know, the radio.
- You mean your tape recorder.

354
00:32:14,013 --> 00:32:17,528
Of all the dirty, rotten tricks,
this one really takes the cake.

355
00:32:17,613 --> 00:32:20,002
- This is one of his better ones.
- You're ruining me.

356
00:32:20,093 --> 00:32:21,082
I know.

357
00:32:21,173 --> 00:32:24,848
- Where's my wrap? I'm leaving.
- Sit down and I'll help you look.

358
00:32:24,933 --> 00:32:27,128
- You're leaving, aren't you?
- No.

359
00:32:27,213 --> 00:32:31,684
- Well, I must have misplaced it.
- No, you didn't. It's in here.

360
00:32:32,653 --> 00:32:35,292
- What's it doing in there?
- He always puts them in there.

361
00:32:35,373 --> 00:32:37,489
- I'll get you. You wait!
- I'll wait.

362
00:32:37,733 --> 00:32:41,328
Look, at least let me walk you home.
It's dark outside.

363
00:32:41,413 --> 00:32:44,132
- A lady unescorted...
- I'd rather be alone.

364
00:33:00,693 --> 00:33:03,048
- Good morning, Ellie.
- Good morning.

365
00:33:03,173 --> 00:33:04,970
I have a present for you.

366
00:33:05,333 --> 00:33:09,246
You don't have to give me presents.
I like you because you're just you.

367
00:33:09,573 --> 00:33:11,643
But this is a present you can share.

368
00:33:11,733 --> 00:33:13,644
- Is it a doll?
- No.

369
00:33:13,733 --> 00:33:16,372
- Is it a puppy?
- It's bigger than a puppy.

370
00:33:17,093 --> 00:33:20,768
- That's smaller than a puppy.
- What it belongs to is bigger.

371
00:33:29,493 --> 00:33:31,165
It's all yours.

372
00:33:34,093 --> 00:33:38,371
- That belongs to me?
- Yep. You got to get somebody to drive it.

373
00:33:39,613 --> 00:33:43,367
It's beautiful. Can I give it to my Pop?
He can drive.

374
00:33:43,653 --> 00:33:45,325
Say, that's a good idea.

375
00:33:45,413 --> 00:33:48,485
Pop, Annie, Debbie! Everybody!

376
00:33:48,733 --> 00:33:51,247
Look what Mr. Steve bought for us.

377
00:33:54,973 --> 00:33:57,407
There you go, honey. Come on, girls.

378
00:34:02,973 --> 00:34:06,329
And there's enough groceries in here
to last you a month.

379
00:34:07,013 --> 00:34:10,449
Aren't you going to give him a note
for the car, Pop?

380
00:34:10,533 --> 00:34:12,125
Sure, Ellie.

381
00:34:13,053 --> 00:34:16,682
To tell you the truth,
I'm so shook up, I don't think I could write.

382
00:34:17,253 --> 00:34:21,087
Girls, won't you say thank you
to Mr. Grayson and Mr. Donford?

383
00:34:21,173 --> 00:34:23,289
- Thank you.
- You're welcome.

384
00:34:23,453 --> 00:34:25,887
Annie, say thank you to Mr. Grayson, now.

385
00:34:26,213 --> 00:34:27,328
Thank you.

386
00:34:27,653 --> 00:34:30,326
Okay, girls, let's go around
and look at the car now.

387
00:34:30,413 --> 00:34:32,483
I just don't know what to say.

388
00:34:33,373 --> 00:34:35,603
- You know something, Mr. Steve?
- What's that?

389
00:34:35,693 --> 00:34:37,843
I wish I were big enough to marry you.

390
00:36:28,653 --> 00:36:32,248
We're nearly at the end of
one of the finest races I've ever seen...

391
00:36:32,333 --> 00:36:34,085
here at Charlotte Motor Speedway...

392
00:36:34,173 --> 00:36:38,052
with a winner's purse of $8,500
plus accessory money.

393
00:36:38,133 --> 00:36:41,284
Here's Steve Grayson, Car Number 6,
into Turn 1.

394
00:36:41,373 --> 00:36:43,841
Right with him, in Car Number 43,
Paul Dado.

395
00:36:46,253 --> 00:36:49,643
These two have been cleaning up
on all the tracks this year.

396
00:36:52,093 --> 00:36:54,527
Out of Turn 4 they come, side by side.

397
00:36:54,613 --> 00:36:56,649
Grayson's the leader by inches...

398
00:36:59,813 --> 00:37:02,043
Out of the turn,
into the main straightaway.

399
00:37:02,133 --> 00:37:04,806
This will be the white flag.
One more to go!

400
00:37:10,813 --> 00:37:13,930
Into the wall! And he's upside-down.

401
00:37:24,573 --> 00:37:28,361
And the checkered flag!
Steve Grayson the winner!

402
00:37:28,453 --> 00:37:32,412
The total purse close to $9,500!

403
00:37:32,613 --> 00:37:34,968
Paul Dado second in the 43 car.

404
00:37:35,053 --> 00:37:37,772
And in for third, Car Number 14.

405
00:37:37,933 --> 00:37:41,482
Mr. Hepworth, he won again. Over $9,000.

406
00:37:41,733 --> 00:37:42,722
He did?

407
00:37:42,813 --> 00:37:45,373
So far, he's the top money winner
on the circuit.

408
00:37:45,453 --> 00:37:48,490
Well, money's what we're interested in.

409
00:37:48,813 --> 00:37:50,644
He's sure making a lot of it.

410
00:37:50,853 --> 00:37:52,571
Good.

411
00:37:52,893 --> 00:37:55,453
I love to hear good news.

412
00:37:56,173 --> 00:37:58,084
I'll keep in touch. Bye.

413
00:37:58,893 --> 00:38:01,726
Now down to the winner's circle.

414
00:38:03,133 --> 00:38:06,091
Mr. Steve Grayson,
may I congratulate you...

415
00:38:06,173 --> 00:38:08,892
on winning the Charlotte Speedway 250.

416
00:38:09,133 --> 00:38:10,282
Thank you.

417
00:38:10,373 --> 00:38:12,364
Isn't there something else
that goes with it?

418
00:38:12,453 --> 00:38:13,681
Of course.

419
00:38:38,533 --> 00:38:40,683
Have you made up your minds yet?

420
00:38:45,013 --> 00:38:46,412
Have you made up your minds yet?

421
00:38:47,133 --> 00:38:50,569
The lady and I will have a steak sandwich,
medium-rare, please.

422
00:38:50,773 --> 00:38:52,764
Steak sandwich, medium-rare.

423
00:38:53,413 --> 00:38:55,643
Hold the onions, please.

424
00:38:56,093 --> 00:38:59,051
"Hold the onions." How thoughtful.

425
00:39:00,493 --> 00:39:02,563
Baked or French fried potatoes?

426
00:39:03,093 --> 00:39:04,526
Tomatoes.

427
00:39:05,813 --> 00:39:07,724
- Tomatoes.
- No dressing.

428
00:39:08,813 --> 00:39:11,611
- Tomato-wise, I mean.
- No dressing, tomato...

429
00:39:12,693 --> 00:39:14,570
Oh, that's cute.

430
00:39:16,413 --> 00:39:20,008
What dressing
would you like on your salad, please?

431
00:39:20,653 --> 00:39:23,690
- What do you have?
- We have French, Thousand Island...

432
00:39:23,933 --> 00:39:26,811
Roquefort, oil and...

433
00:39:28,813 --> 00:39:31,566
- Vinegar?
- Vinegar, yeah.

434
00:39:32,893 --> 00:39:34,246
Thank you.

435
00:39:35,293 --> 00:39:36,772
I'll have Roquefort.

436
00:39:36,853 --> 00:39:39,890
That will be 35 cents extra.

437
00:39:40,493 --> 00:39:43,405
It's okay. She can have
all the Roquefort she wants.

438
00:39:43,813 --> 00:39:45,804
That's wonderful.

439
00:39:46,373 --> 00:39:49,171
He doesn't care if it costs extra.

440
00:39:50,413 --> 00:39:54,486
My poor boyfriend, he's so poor
he can't afford anything extra.

441
00:39:54,733 --> 00:39:56,963
He needs all his money for school.

442
00:39:57,613 --> 00:40:00,173
He's still got four more years to go...

443
00:40:00,333 --> 00:40:03,450
before he becomes a registered nurse.

444
00:40:03,973 --> 00:40:05,406
Nurse?

445
00:40:06,173 --> 00:40:07,526
Male, that is.

446
00:40:09,173 --> 00:40:12,165
I'll get your order
with the extra Roquefort.

447
00:40:12,253 --> 00:40:13,368
Thank you.

448
00:40:15,693 --> 00:40:17,206
Problems.

449
00:40:17,293 --> 00:40:20,330
I think she really loves the guy.
I wonder what I can do to help.

450
00:40:20,973 --> 00:40:23,168
The ceremony is really a rocker.

451
00:40:23,373 --> 00:40:25,807
Bye! Thank you!

452
00:40:26,613 --> 00:40:28,126
Have a happy, happy!

453
00:40:28,213 --> 00:40:30,602
Don't forget to take the You Drive back.

454
00:40:50,853 --> 00:40:52,889
- Your bouquet.
- No, you caught it.

455
00:40:52,973 --> 00:40:55,771
And you know what they say
about catching the bridal bouquet.

456
00:40:55,853 --> 00:40:59,562
- That's when it's thrown by the bride.
- I was just giving it a little assist.

457
00:40:59,653 --> 00:41:01,325
Hey, wait a minute.

458
00:41:01,973 --> 00:41:03,326
We can't let this happen.

459
00:41:03,413 --> 00:41:05,927
I'm sure we can't,
whatever we're talking about.

460
00:41:06,013 --> 00:41:10,131
The bouquet. Look at the way
the petals are drooping. They're in a coma.

461
00:41:10,293 --> 00:41:13,603
- What do you suggest, Doctor?
- We got to get it in some water.

462
00:41:13,693 --> 00:41:16,526
- Where should we go?
- I know you'll think of something.

463
00:41:16,613 --> 00:41:19,081
My place is too far, so let's go to yours.

464
00:41:19,173 --> 00:41:22,882
- See? I knew you'd think of a place.
- But we gotta hurry before it's too late.

465
00:41:22,973 --> 00:41:25,771
There he goes with
that put-the-flowers-in-the-vase bit.

466
00:41:25,853 --> 00:41:28,083
I'll break the vase over your silly head.

467
00:41:28,173 --> 00:41:31,722
If I were a girl,
I'd let the measles in before letting him in.

468
00:41:31,813 --> 00:41:35,089
- Don't stop now. You're killing me.
- You know what else she should do?

469
00:41:35,173 --> 00:41:38,449
She should pile her furniture
against the door.

470
00:41:38,533 --> 00:41:41,001
Now, miss, if you want someone
who's mucho charming...

471
00:41:41,093 --> 00:41:43,607
who's a champion furniture pusher, I'll...

472
00:41:43,893 --> 00:41:45,212
She's gone.

473
00:42:08,853 --> 00:42:12,846
- Why did they call me in?
- You've been making it big recently.

474
00:42:13,173 --> 00:42:16,449
They call in everyone
over a certain income. It's just routine.

475
00:42:16,533 --> 00:42:18,205
Yeah? Well, I'm worried.

476
00:42:18,413 --> 00:42:20,290
You've got nothing to norry...

477
00:42:20,693 --> 00:42:24,083
Nothing to worry about, Mac.
It's like your friend says.

478
00:42:24,173 --> 00:42:26,164
It's just routine.

479
00:42:31,413 --> 00:42:32,562
Thanks.

480
00:42:35,413 --> 00:42:38,052
You had my income tax made out
by a reliable man, right?

481
00:42:38,133 --> 00:42:40,044
- Well, of course.
- Of course what?

482
00:42:40,133 --> 00:42:42,567
I had your income tax made out
by a reliable man.

483
00:42:42,653 --> 00:42:45,690
You're looking me straight in the eye.
That means you're lying.

484
00:42:45,773 --> 00:42:47,764
- Boy, I'm in trouble.
- No, you're not.

485
00:42:47,853 --> 00:42:50,811
- Then why am I here?
- Maybe they just want to get acquainted.

486
00:42:50,893 --> 00:42:53,282
- Knock it off.
- You know something?

487
00:42:53,813 --> 00:42:55,644
- You're scared.
- You better believe it.

488
00:42:55,733 --> 00:42:58,008
Just like everybody else in this room.

489
00:42:58,253 --> 00:43:01,006
These tax people are nice, warm,
friendly people.

490
00:43:01,333 --> 00:43:03,005
Thank you, Mr. Hepworth.

491
00:43:06,293 --> 00:43:07,851
See how relaxed he is?

492
00:43:11,253 --> 00:43:14,165
All right, sir. It's all right.
You'll be just fine.

493
00:43:14,893 --> 00:43:16,884
You'll be all right, sir.

494
00:43:17,013 --> 00:43:18,969
We'll get you a drink of water.

495
00:46:31,893 --> 00:46:33,849
Mr. Steven Grayson, please.

496
00:46:33,933 --> 00:46:36,163
I'm Mr. Grayson. This is Mr. Donford.

497
00:46:36,413 --> 00:46:38,449
I'm Mr. Hepworth.

498
00:46:39,293 --> 00:46:41,204
Well, you don't need me.

499
00:46:41,853 --> 00:46:43,491
Come with me, please.

500
00:46:59,853 --> 00:47:01,764
Please be seated, gentlemen.

501
00:47:03,933 --> 00:47:07,926
Would you care for anything:
Cigarettes, cigars, soft drink?

502
00:47:08,013 --> 00:47:09,685
A straight scotch with a gin chaser.

503
00:47:09,773 --> 00:47:12,241
No, thank you, sir.
We won't have anything.

504
00:47:12,613 --> 00:47:16,128
Quite an interesting tax return
you made out, Mr. Grayson.

505
00:47:16,613 --> 00:47:17,807
I made out.

506
00:47:18,533 --> 00:47:22,082
- You made out the form, Mr. Donford?
- All by myself.

507
00:47:22,573 --> 00:47:24,882
Well, congratulations, Mr. Donford.

508
00:47:25,453 --> 00:47:27,284
I'd like to shake your hand.

509
00:47:27,653 --> 00:47:29,371
It is the most ridiculous...

510
00:47:29,453 --> 00:47:32,809
impossible, jumbled, disorganized return...

511
00:47:32,893 --> 00:47:35,282
I have ever seen in all my 30 years.

512
00:47:38,413 --> 00:47:42,008
- I ought to break you in half.
- You'd then have two very short friends.

513
00:47:42,093 --> 00:47:43,128
Funny.

514
00:47:43,213 --> 00:47:46,842
You have a great many deductions
I would like to have explained.

515
00:47:47,613 --> 00:47:49,569
Under "business entertainment":

516
00:47:49,653 --> 00:47:53,885
Rental of a powerboat
listed at $100 a day...

517
00:47:54,493 --> 00:47:56,961
and $200 a day...

518
00:47:58,013 --> 00:47:59,969
- for bait?
- Bait?

519
00:48:01,133 --> 00:48:04,091
- We had to buy presents for the girls.
- Presents?

520
00:48:05,733 --> 00:48:08,122
That's what you classify as bait.

521
00:48:08,213 --> 00:48:11,410
Yes, we didn't do much fishing.
But, boy, did it work out!

522
00:48:11,973 --> 00:48:13,326
Disallowed.

523
00:48:16,093 --> 00:48:18,402
"Depreciation on stock car.

524
00:48:18,613 --> 00:48:22,367
"Salaries for the mechanics.

525
00:48:23,133 --> 00:48:24,486
That's all right.

526
00:48:24,973 --> 00:48:28,522
"Gas, tires, maintenance."

527
00:48:28,813 --> 00:48:30,166
That's all right.

528
00:48:33,893 --> 00:48:37,852
$4,000 for air?

529
00:48:38,453 --> 00:48:40,921
Now, that I don't understand.

530
00:48:41,213 --> 00:48:43,681
I'm with you. Explain that one, will you?

531
00:48:47,173 --> 00:48:50,165
We stopped in this gas station...

532
00:48:50,253 --> 00:48:51,891
to check the tires.

533
00:48:51,973 --> 00:48:53,645
But Steve...

534
00:48:54,333 --> 00:48:56,722
he got to talking
to the owner of the station...

535
00:48:56,813 --> 00:48:59,725
and he told us how tough things were.

536
00:49:00,093 --> 00:49:04,245
So we invested $4,000
just to help him out...

537
00:49:04,333 --> 00:49:06,893
and he blew the money. So I figured...

538
00:49:06,973 --> 00:49:10,010
The air cost $4,000.

539
00:49:11,373 --> 00:49:13,603
- Disallowed.
- Right.

540
00:49:18,173 --> 00:49:21,210
"Station wagon, furniture,
You Drive trailer...

541
00:49:21,293 --> 00:49:23,090
"flowers," etc...

542
00:49:23,293 --> 00:49:25,523
all listed under "charities."

543
00:49:26,133 --> 00:49:28,488
- Very commendable.
- Thank you.

544
00:49:28,653 --> 00:49:30,211
Watch out for the zinger.

545
00:49:30,293 --> 00:49:34,571
Unless these are registered,
recognized, licensed charities...

546
00:49:34,653 --> 00:49:36,450
these deductions cannot be allowed.

547
00:49:36,533 --> 00:49:39,252
- Now, just one minute.
- Skip it, Kenny.

548
00:49:39,333 --> 00:49:42,450
- We spent that money!
- I said, skip it. Tie your tie.

549
00:49:43,133 --> 00:49:45,408
Now, under "business deductions"...

550
00:49:45,493 --> 00:49:48,371
you have listed a $22,000 trailer...

551
00:49:48,453 --> 00:49:51,172
with various mechanical
and electronic devices...

552
00:49:51,453 --> 00:49:54,251
perfumed record albums...

553
00:49:54,333 --> 00:49:56,051
and pages and pages...

554
00:49:56,133 --> 00:49:59,170
Stop right there, Mr. Hepworth.
There is no sense in going on.

555
00:49:59,253 --> 00:50:01,847
There's been a lot of mistakes made.

556
00:50:02,173 --> 00:50:05,529
- We'll do something about it.
- That's about the size of it.

557
00:50:06,693 --> 00:50:08,968
How much does "about the size of it"
amount to?

558
00:50:09,053 --> 00:50:13,251
About $145,000.

559
00:50:15,733 --> 00:50:18,406
$145,000?

560
00:50:18,493 --> 00:50:20,723
That's an awful lot of money.

561
00:50:22,333 --> 00:50:26,372
Now, if you agree to an arrangement
we have in mind...

562
00:50:26,453 --> 00:50:29,286
one of our staff
will collect all of your earnings.

563
00:50:29,773 --> 00:50:33,891
You will be put on a strict budget
until you repay the government...

564
00:50:33,973 --> 00:50:36,612
every penny you owe.

565
00:50:55,773 --> 00:50:59,368
All of a sudden,
he decides to test the car at 6:00 a.m.

566
00:50:59,453 --> 00:51:01,091
And I got home at 5:00.

567
00:51:07,493 --> 00:51:11,122
- He's really giving it a beating!
- I bet nothing's wrong with it.

568
00:51:11,293 --> 00:51:13,807
You know Steve.
When he's mad and he wants to find...

569
00:51:13,893 --> 00:51:15,770
- $5 he don't.
- You're on!

570
00:51:44,733 --> 00:51:45,848
Run her up, Birdie.

571
00:51:45,933 --> 00:51:48,731
- Any problems?
- Not a one, man. She's really honking.

572
00:51:48,813 --> 00:51:50,246
See you guys later.

573
00:51:52,813 --> 00:51:55,646
"Honking" means
she's running exceptionally well.

574
00:51:55,733 --> 00:51:56,848
Scratch.

575
00:51:58,373 --> 00:51:59,442
Thank you.

576
00:52:01,813 --> 00:52:03,724
Steve, I've got it!

577
00:52:06,733 --> 00:52:08,928
- You got what?
- The check from the last race.

578
00:52:09,013 --> 00:52:11,925
- What do you mean?
- Right here in my sneaky hand.

579
00:52:12,013 --> 00:52:14,607
Mr. Hepworth is sending someone
to collect the money.

580
00:52:14,693 --> 00:52:17,605
Yeah, I know,
but I thought we could hold onto it.

581
00:52:17,693 --> 00:52:18,808
- No.
- On a permanent basis.

582
00:52:18,893 --> 00:52:20,611
We made a deal, and we'll keep it.

583
00:52:20,693 --> 00:52:24,732
Steve, $7,500 in case
we need a few essential luxuries.

584
00:52:24,813 --> 00:52:26,246
You aren't an honest person.

585
00:52:26,333 --> 00:52:28,369
- That's part of my charm.
- Give me the check.

586
00:52:28,453 --> 00:52:31,251
It doesn't belong to us. Get in the car.

587
00:52:31,333 --> 00:52:33,972
You're making a mistake.
A guy's got to live.

588
00:52:34,053 --> 00:52:35,281
You can't...

589
00:52:37,533 --> 00:52:41,162
Hello, Mr. Hepworth, I went
to collect the check, but it was gone.

590
00:52:41,373 --> 00:52:44,251
We had an agreement, and I trusted him.

591
00:52:44,893 --> 00:52:47,009
This is very discouraging.

592
00:52:47,333 --> 00:52:50,006
I'll get the check back. Don't you worry.

593
00:52:50,453 --> 00:52:53,331
It shows you how much
Mr. Grayson's word means.

594
00:52:58,813 --> 00:53:01,725
I hear music. Where are you calling from?

595
00:53:01,893 --> 00:53:05,090
Your expense account
doesn't include going to dances.

596
00:53:05,213 --> 00:53:07,602
I know, sir. I'm in his trailer.

597
00:53:12,733 --> 00:53:15,452
It sounds like wild animals.
Are you being attacked?

598
00:53:15,533 --> 00:53:17,888
Not yet. Mr. Grayson isn't here.

599
00:53:19,413 --> 00:53:22,086
He's got all kinds of gimmicks
in this trailer.

600
00:53:22,253 --> 00:53:24,244
Gimmicks? You be careful.

601
00:53:24,653 --> 00:53:26,325
Oh, yes. I'll be careful.

602
00:53:26,413 --> 00:53:29,166
And I'll get that check back, too. Goodbye.

603
00:53:44,613 --> 00:53:46,126
That figures.

604
00:53:46,653 --> 00:53:47,768
Relax.

605
00:53:49,853 --> 00:53:52,413
Let every muscle in your body go limp.

606
00:53:52,653 --> 00:53:54,609
You never felt so good.

607
00:53:55,133 --> 00:53:56,885
You don't want to go home.

608
00:53:58,053 --> 00:54:01,011
You're beginning to get tired. Tired.

609
00:54:13,533 --> 00:54:15,569
Hi there. No, don't move.

610
00:54:15,653 --> 00:54:18,087
I want to remember you
exactly as you are.

611
00:54:19,373 --> 00:54:20,852
The check, please.

612
00:54:21,733 --> 00:54:24,293
- What did you say?
- She said, "The check, please."

613
00:54:24,373 --> 00:54:25,567
I speak her language.

614
00:54:25,653 --> 00:54:28,645
If she said "The check, please,"
that means...

615
00:54:29,293 --> 00:54:32,285
- Are you thinking what I'm thinking?
- My name is Susan Jacks.

616
00:54:32,373 --> 00:54:34,648
I work for the Internal Revenue Service.

617
00:54:34,733 --> 00:54:37,406
Beautiful. Just beautiful.

618
00:54:37,733 --> 00:54:41,043
According to Mr. Hepworth,
you made a certain agreement.

619
00:54:41,373 --> 00:54:43,762
Remind me to write him
a nasty letter of thanks.

620
00:54:43,853 --> 00:54:46,492
- Let me handle this.
- You've done enough already.

621
00:54:46,573 --> 00:54:49,041
But you're too honest to deal with her.

622
00:54:49,213 --> 00:54:51,408
I'll be back. I have to wash his car.

623
00:54:56,133 --> 00:54:57,452
Here's the check.

624
00:54:59,773 --> 00:55:00,967
Thank you.

625
00:55:02,453 --> 00:55:03,886
You must understand...

626
00:55:03,973 --> 00:55:06,328
that you owe the government
a great deal of money.

627
00:55:06,413 --> 00:55:09,883
Unless you pay it promptly,
your indebtedness will pyramid...

628
00:55:09,973 --> 00:55:12,612
and you'll never be solvent again.

629
00:55:15,853 --> 00:55:19,050
I don't think you realize
the gravity of the situation.

630
00:55:19,133 --> 00:55:22,330
- Let's sit down and discuss it.
- Yes.

631
00:55:24,093 --> 00:55:26,561
First, there's the amount
of your allowance.

632
00:55:27,893 --> 00:55:30,566
You understand
it must be a minimum figure.

633
00:55:31,093 --> 00:55:34,051
In order to pay back $145,000...

634
00:55:34,133 --> 00:55:36,852
we must be as efficient as we possibly...

635
00:55:37,653 --> 00:55:38,688
can.

636
00:55:40,213 --> 00:55:41,692
Interest compounds.

637
00:55:41,933 --> 00:55:45,369
Therefore, the quicker
you make restitution, the better.

638
00:55:46,173 --> 00:55:48,562
Now, I know it's going to be...

639
00:55:50,733 --> 00:55:53,008
- a pong lull.
- Long pull.

640
00:55:59,453 --> 00:56:02,331
This situation demands drastic measures.

641
00:56:05,693 --> 00:56:08,765
- As to your allowance, Mr. Grayson...
- Anything you say.

642
00:56:14,933 --> 00:56:16,889
As to your...

643
00:56:18,213 --> 00:56:19,441
Allowance.

644
00:56:20,573 --> 00:56:21,847
Your allowance.

645
00:56:22,053 --> 00:56:25,409
Mr. Hepworth thought
that $100 would be sufficient.

646
00:56:25,693 --> 00:56:28,207
I can make out fine on $100 a day.

647
00:56:30,093 --> 00:56:33,165
No. Your allowance will be $100 a week.

648
00:56:34,173 --> 00:56:37,404
$100 a week?
I spend more than that on Band-Aids.

649
00:56:37,493 --> 00:56:40,769
- I'm afraid that's it, Mr. Grayson.
- What are you trying to do to me?

650
00:56:40,853 --> 00:56:41,842
Nothing.

651
00:56:41,933 --> 00:56:44,811
I only work for Mr. Hepworth.
I don't make any rules.

652
00:56:44,893 --> 00:56:48,249
- Sure, sure.
- But it's true. There's nothing personal.

653
00:56:48,453 --> 00:56:52,287
- I'm just carrying out orders.
- And loving every minute of it.

654
00:56:52,413 --> 00:56:56,167
If you don't believe me,
call Mr. Hepworth. There's the phone.

655
00:56:56,573 --> 00:56:59,041
I know where the phone is. I live here.

656
00:57:00,093 --> 00:57:03,449
Well, I'm afraid we have nothing more
to say to each other.

657
00:57:03,653 --> 00:57:06,929
- I'm not through with you yet.
- Goodbye, Mr. Grayson.

658
00:57:09,893 --> 00:57:12,088
Is everything all right, Miss Jacks?

659
00:57:12,733 --> 00:57:16,567
Did you and Steve
reach a nice, fair, liberal allowance?

660
00:57:16,933 --> 00:57:19,049
Somewhere in there
there's room for an answer.

661
00:57:19,133 --> 00:57:21,886
Your allowance will be $50 a week.

662
00:57:23,453 --> 00:57:25,364
That's the wrong answer!

663
00:57:33,853 --> 00:57:35,002
$50.

664
00:57:36,493 --> 00:57:39,405
Boy, did you ever fix it!

665
00:57:39,493 --> 00:57:41,324
Do you know
what my allowance is gonna be?

666
00:57:41,413 --> 00:57:43,608
No, but mine is $100 a week.

667
00:57:43,693 --> 00:57:46,332
We can't live on $150 a week.

668
00:57:46,613 --> 00:57:47,807
You've gotta talk to her.

669
00:57:47,893 --> 00:57:51,090
I wouldn't ask that iceberg for anything
even if...

670
00:57:51,173 --> 00:57:52,925
- If we were dead broke?
- Yeah.

671
00:57:53,013 --> 00:57:54,082
We're dead broke.

672
00:57:54,173 --> 00:57:56,892
What happened to the money
you were supposed to be holding?

673
00:57:56,973 --> 00:57:58,850
We should have a few thousand.

674
00:57:58,933 --> 00:58:01,083
- There were expenses.
- What else?

675
00:58:02,413 --> 00:58:03,971
- Presents.
- Go on.

676
00:58:06,053 --> 00:58:08,965
Phone calls! Lots of phone calls.

677
00:58:09,333 --> 00:58:10,322
Hello?

678
00:58:10,973 --> 00:58:13,771
- Is this Donford?
- No, I'm not in right now.

679
00:58:13,853 --> 00:58:15,969
I know it's you. This is Tillman.

680
00:58:18,213 --> 00:58:19,692
I'm glad you called.

681
00:58:19,853 --> 00:58:22,572
No, you're not.
Your horse didn't come in again.

682
00:58:22,653 --> 00:58:26,566
You better pay the bread. I'm getting tired
of carrying you on the books.

683
00:58:28,093 --> 00:58:32,484
I'll see if I can't try
and squeeze you in on Saturday.

684
00:58:32,733 --> 00:58:34,644
Saturday's as far as we go.

685
00:58:39,613 --> 00:58:40,887
Goodbye, baby.

686
00:58:41,973 --> 00:58:43,088
Baby?

687
00:58:53,133 --> 00:58:55,772
What room did you say Miss Jacks was in?

688
00:58:56,733 --> 00:58:58,485
- 1210.
- You're right!

689
00:59:16,293 --> 00:59:18,488
- Yes?
- Hi, remember me? I'm Kenny.

690
00:59:18,573 --> 00:59:20,131
May I come in, please?

691
00:59:20,213 --> 00:59:22,681
American Beauty roses
for an American beauty.

692
00:59:22,773 --> 00:59:24,252
All right, give me the pitch.

693
00:59:24,333 --> 00:59:27,882
No. The roses are yours,
to have and to hold. No strings attached.

694
00:59:27,973 --> 00:59:31,932
No, thank you very much. You have them
and keep them. Good night.

695
00:59:32,013 --> 00:59:34,971
There is one thing we might discuss.
You see, it concerns...

696
00:59:35,053 --> 00:59:36,566
You tell Mr. Grayson...

697
00:59:36,653 --> 00:59:38,962
that I'm not empowered
to make any changes...

698
00:59:39,053 --> 00:59:40,850
in his arrangements with the government.

699
00:59:40,933 --> 00:59:44,846
- And even if I were, I wouldn't.
- Mr. Grayson did not send me.

700
00:59:45,133 --> 00:59:47,089
He doesn't send me, either.

701
00:59:47,173 --> 00:59:49,209
He doesn't even know that I came here.

702
00:59:49,293 --> 00:59:51,853
I'm here on an errand of mercy
on his behalf.

703
00:59:51,933 --> 00:59:54,606
- How much?
- Well, I'm embarrassed for him.

704
00:59:55,053 --> 00:59:56,771
Embarrassed for how much?

705
00:59:57,813 --> 01:00:00,327
About $7,500 worth.

706
01:00:00,413 --> 01:00:03,052
If you could just give me back
the check he gave you...

707
01:00:03,133 --> 01:00:04,248
- Out.
- Please.

708
01:00:04,333 --> 01:00:08,121
Don't blame him. Blame me.
Some men are weaker than others.

709
01:00:08,893 --> 01:00:12,090
- Out!
- Don't bother showing me out the door.

710
01:00:13,053 --> 01:00:14,725
I'll use the window.

711
01:00:17,213 --> 01:00:20,091
- May I open it for you?
- You're very polite.

712
01:00:21,773 --> 01:00:24,492
I don't jump out of windows
unless they're in the basement.

713
01:00:24,573 --> 01:00:25,688
Chicken.

714
01:00:27,933 --> 01:00:28,922
Bye.

715
01:00:34,813 --> 01:00:35,848
Come in.

716
01:00:46,573 --> 01:00:48,848
- Mr. Grayson.
- Yes?

717
01:00:49,573 --> 01:00:52,087
- Here are your flowers.
- Well, thank you.

718
01:00:52,293 --> 01:00:55,091
Your allowance check will be $64.50.

719
01:00:55,293 --> 01:00:57,648
Wait a minute.
I thought it was supposed to be $100.

720
01:00:57,733 --> 01:00:59,530
I called the florist.

721
01:00:59,653 --> 01:01:01,530
What has he got to do with my allowance?

722
01:01:01,613 --> 01:01:05,208
The flowers were charged
to your account. $35.50.

723
01:01:05,773 --> 01:01:08,731
Now, $35.50 from $100...

724
01:01:08,933 --> 01:01:11,163
leaves $64.50.

725
01:01:11,533 --> 01:01:12,932
I wouldn't send you flowers...

726
01:01:13,013 --> 01:01:16,244
- if you were the last person on earth.
- I have some advice for you.

727
01:01:16,333 --> 01:01:19,609
- Lf you're trying to trick me...
- What do you mean, trick you?

728
01:01:19,693 --> 01:01:22,412
- You know what I mean.
- No, I don't know.

729
01:01:22,853 --> 01:01:25,208
Furthermore, I've had just about enough.

730
01:01:27,373 --> 01:01:28,567
My dinner!

731
01:01:43,413 --> 01:01:46,883
No, Steve won't make a move
without first asking for my advice.

732
01:01:46,973 --> 01:01:48,804
I leave nothing to chance.

733
01:01:50,133 --> 01:01:53,011
First, I analyze the wind...

734
01:01:56,173 --> 01:01:57,845
then the time of day...

735
01:01:58,053 --> 01:02:00,851
and then the angle of the track.

736
01:02:03,493 --> 01:02:07,202
Then I sit down with Steve,
and we have a nice long talk.

737
01:02:07,293 --> 01:02:10,490
I tell him exactly the way
I want him to drive.

738
01:02:11,613 --> 01:02:13,888
No, we don't win by chance.

739
01:02:14,413 --> 01:02:17,405
The whole thing is psychological.

740
01:02:21,173 --> 01:02:22,288
Listen...

741
01:02:23,453 --> 01:02:27,446
what do you say we go someplace
just a little more private?

742
01:02:39,213 --> 01:02:43,001
- I want to talk to you, Donford.
- Donford? There must be some mistake.

743
01:02:44,133 --> 01:02:46,806
- That's not my name!
- Yes, it is!

744
01:02:47,293 --> 01:02:50,729
If you don't get the bread before Saturday,
I'll beat your brains out.

745
01:02:50,813 --> 01:02:52,565
- You understand that?
- Yes.

746
01:02:54,333 --> 01:02:56,449
I understand. Saturday.

747
01:03:13,173 --> 01:03:14,970
Ellie, what are you doing here?

748
01:03:15,053 --> 01:03:18,682
I know you didn't want us
thrown out of our station wagon.

749
01:03:18,773 --> 01:03:20,570
Who threw you out of your station wagon?

750
01:03:20,653 --> 01:03:23,372
Sorry to break in on you this way,
Mr. Grayson.

751
01:03:23,573 --> 01:03:27,612
- What's this about being thrown out?
- They repossessed it, Mr. Grayson.

752
01:03:27,693 --> 01:03:29,046
Terrible shock.

753
01:03:29,133 --> 01:03:31,044
Repossessed it? That's impossible.

754
01:03:31,133 --> 01:03:33,647
They had a paper. All legal and everything.

755
01:03:36,773 --> 01:03:38,047
Yes, Pop?

756
01:03:38,133 --> 01:03:40,886
Would you put the other girls
to bed, honey?

757
01:03:40,973 --> 01:03:43,692
- Put them on the couch.
- That will be fine.

758
01:03:43,773 --> 01:03:45,411
This whole thing is ridiculous.

759
01:03:45,493 --> 01:03:47,768
I gave Kenny the money to pay cash for it.

760
01:03:47,853 --> 01:03:49,172
I'm sure you did.

761
01:03:50,573 --> 01:03:52,609
I guess it's not so ridiculous after all.

762
01:03:52,693 --> 01:03:56,368
I hope you don't mind,
but it's way past the girls' bedtime.

763
01:03:56,453 --> 01:03:57,442
What?

764
01:03:58,333 --> 01:04:01,211
- The bedroom is right back there.
- Good. Thank you.

765
01:04:01,773 --> 01:04:03,968
I'll get you some milk later, honey.

766
01:04:04,053 --> 01:04:05,725
- Pardon me.
- Sure.

767
01:04:11,933 --> 01:04:13,764
I see we have visitors.

768
01:04:14,173 --> 01:04:16,971
- You'll excuse me if I go to bed.
- Hold it. It's occupied.

769
01:04:17,053 --> 01:04:19,886
Why didn't you pay cash
for that station wagon?

770
01:04:20,093 --> 01:04:21,845
- Oh, that.
- Yeah, that.

771
01:04:26,453 --> 01:04:27,488
Hello?

772
01:04:29,133 --> 01:04:31,408
Lori, what's the matter?

773
01:04:31,533 --> 01:04:34,411
They repossessed our furniture.

774
01:04:35,013 --> 01:04:37,925
What did you do with the money
I gave you for Lori's furniture?

775
01:04:38,013 --> 01:04:39,685
I'm still working on the station wagon.

776
01:04:39,773 --> 01:04:43,482
This is no time to be funny.
I wanna know... Lori, hush.

777
01:04:45,853 --> 01:04:48,925
I want some straight answers.
What did you do with all that money?

778
01:04:49,013 --> 01:04:52,244
What happened to the money?
I was held up!

779
01:04:52,333 --> 01:04:56,008
You're looking me straight in the eye
again, and that means you're lying.

780
01:04:56,093 --> 01:04:59,005
I'll be with you in a minute, Lori.
Now out with it!

781
01:05:01,933 --> 01:05:04,083
Not you, Lori. You!

782
01:05:06,293 --> 01:05:09,251
I've always liked the horses,
but I could never pick them.

783
01:05:09,333 --> 01:05:13,485
The more I tried to get even,
the deeper I got with your money.

784
01:05:13,853 --> 01:05:15,445
I'm sorry, Steve.

785
01:05:16,293 --> 01:05:17,521
Where are you now, Lori?

786
01:05:17,613 --> 01:05:20,332
We're spending
the rest of our honeymoon...

787
01:05:20,413 --> 01:05:22,722
at his mother's house.

788
01:05:23,853 --> 01:05:25,889
I'll get back to you. Don't worry, honey.

789
01:05:25,973 --> 01:05:28,203
I don't deserve to be called "honey."

790
01:05:33,773 --> 01:05:36,412
- Good night, Mr. Grayson.
- Good night.

791
01:05:41,773 --> 01:05:42,888
Hello.

792
01:05:43,213 --> 01:05:45,283
Susan, Paul. I'm down in the lobby.

793
01:05:45,373 --> 01:05:48,331
Yes, Paul, I'm ready.
I'll be down in a minute.

794
01:05:57,133 --> 01:05:59,010
I don't recall inviting you here.

795
01:05:59,093 --> 01:06:01,288
I hate being here
as much as you hate seeing me.

796
01:06:01,373 --> 01:06:04,729
- That finishes our visit, doesn't it?
- I've got to talk to you.

797
01:06:04,813 --> 01:06:07,532
- I have an appointment.
- And I need $7,500.

798
01:06:08,053 --> 01:06:10,169
Good night, Mr. Grayson. There's the door.

799
01:06:10,253 --> 01:06:13,484
Look, everything I bought
for the Esterlakes, Lori, and the others...

800
01:06:13,573 --> 01:06:14,722
has been repossessed.

801
01:06:14,813 --> 01:06:18,362
- You should have paid cash.
- I thought I did. I got to have the money.

802
01:06:18,453 --> 01:06:21,172
That's against the rules
of the Internal Revenue Service.

803
01:06:21,253 --> 01:06:23,448
Good night, Mr. Grayson, and goodbye.

804
01:06:23,533 --> 01:06:26,525
Don't "goodnight and goodbye" me,
Miss Internal Revenue Service.

805
01:06:26,613 --> 01:06:29,491
- Get your hands off me!
- You'll listen to me first.

806
01:06:34,493 --> 01:06:36,404
It was a fist. I saw it.

807
01:06:37,453 --> 01:06:38,966
It's a game.

808
01:06:39,053 --> 01:06:42,090
- I'm not finished with you yet.
- Watch where you're going!

809
01:06:42,173 --> 01:06:44,733
Please, there's a man after me. Stop him.

810
01:06:44,813 --> 01:06:46,644
Hey, you. Come back here.

811
01:06:47,133 --> 01:06:50,250
- Please don't let him get me. There he is!
- Excuse me.

812
01:06:50,333 --> 01:06:53,769
I'm sorry. I have to catch that plane.
I mean, that girl.

813
01:06:56,093 --> 01:06:58,004
- Excuse me.
- Excuse me. Pardon me.

814
01:06:58,093 --> 01:07:00,561
- No, you don't.
- Somebody call the police.

815
01:07:00,653 --> 01:07:03,008
I know you're in here somewhere.
You'll listen to me.

816
01:07:03,093 --> 01:07:04,367
No, I'm not.

817
01:07:04,453 --> 01:07:07,126
I will talk sense to you,
if it's the last thing I ever do.

818
01:07:07,213 --> 01:07:09,044
That will be the last thing you ever do.

819
01:07:09,133 --> 01:07:12,603
If I could get near you,
I'd knock that stubbornness out of you.

820
01:07:21,213 --> 01:07:22,885
I want to see the manager.

821
01:07:22,973 --> 01:07:25,248
They ought to condemn that elevator.

822
01:07:26,973 --> 01:07:30,488
- George, I want you to sue this hotel.
- Yes, dear.

823
01:07:30,613 --> 01:07:34,401
- We're checking out right now.
- We're not even staying here.

824
01:07:35,213 --> 01:07:37,727
- I've got you. You listen to me, will you?
- Let her go.

825
01:07:37,813 --> 01:07:39,963
- Make me.
- Gladly.

826
01:07:48,213 --> 01:07:49,612
What floor, buddy?

827
01:07:53,253 --> 01:07:54,322
No, you don't.

828
01:07:54,413 --> 01:07:56,244
You're gonna listen to what I have to say.

829
01:07:56,333 --> 01:07:58,324
- No, I'm not.
- Yes, you are.

830
01:07:58,413 --> 01:08:01,246
- Let go of me!
- What's everybody looking at?

831
01:08:12,573 --> 01:08:13,926
You sit here and listen to me.

832
01:08:14,013 --> 01:08:18,245
You are the most obstinate, stubborn,
ornery, impossible girl I ever met.

833
01:08:18,333 --> 01:08:21,325
You just won't admit there's another side.
My side.

834
01:08:21,413 --> 01:08:23,927
You know why?
Because you're unreasonable.

835
01:08:24,013 --> 01:08:26,891
Sit still. You're argumentative, mulish...

836
01:08:26,973 --> 01:08:28,452
uncooperative...

837
01:08:29,853 --> 01:08:31,411
and unbelievable.

838
01:08:37,213 --> 01:08:40,888
No. It could never work.
We're complete opposites.

839
01:08:41,653 --> 01:08:44,292
You're wild, extravagant, and unreliable.

840
01:08:44,373 --> 01:08:47,092
You're not the kind of man
that I should fall in love with.

841
01:08:47,173 --> 01:08:49,846
And besides,
we don't even like each other.

842
01:11:40,973 --> 01:11:43,692
- Hi, Steve.
- Hey, it's late.

843
01:11:43,773 --> 01:11:47,402
- Why aren't you in the car, sleeping?
- I couldn't close my eyes.

844
01:11:47,493 --> 01:11:50,053
- How'd you do with Miss Iceberg?
- Great. Just wonderful.

845
01:11:50,133 --> 01:11:52,886
- You got the money.
- Not exactly, but we can get it.

846
01:11:52,973 --> 01:11:55,043
- You're kidding!
- No, not at all.

847
01:11:55,133 --> 01:11:58,443
You're supposed to be the smart guy.
Why didn't you think of it?

848
01:11:58,533 --> 01:12:00,888
- What's "it"?
- The trailer trap, man.

849
01:12:00,973 --> 01:12:03,771
- We can sell it.
- Sell it? The trailer trap?

850
01:12:03,853 --> 01:12:06,083
Sure, we can get at least $12,000 for it.

851
01:12:06,173 --> 01:12:09,529
We can pay everybody we owe,
and all our problems are solved.

852
01:12:10,213 --> 01:12:13,330
How can you think of selling
the trailer trap for a measly $12,000?

853
01:12:13,413 --> 01:12:16,689
It's worth a lot more! It's worth at least...

854
01:12:17,453 --> 01:12:18,442
Oh, boy.

855
01:12:23,133 --> 01:12:24,725
What are they doing here?

856
01:12:24,813 --> 01:12:27,646
The company repossessed the trailer trap.

857
01:12:35,693 --> 01:12:37,092
They're adorable.

858
01:12:41,813 --> 01:12:43,769
Good night!

859
01:12:48,773 --> 01:12:50,092
Oh, boy.

860
01:12:50,813 --> 01:12:53,771
- I've got to get some money somewhere.
- Yes.

861
01:12:54,293 --> 01:12:57,205
My stock car. I could sell it
for at least $10,000 or $15,000.

862
01:12:57,293 --> 01:13:00,046
No, you can't.
You'd be giving up your future.

863
01:13:00,533 --> 01:13:01,886
What future?

864
01:13:02,453 --> 01:13:03,932
Wait a minute.

865
01:13:08,013 --> 01:13:09,002
Operator.

866
01:13:22,173 --> 01:13:24,004
- Hello?
- Hello, Mr. Hepworth.

867
01:13:24,253 --> 01:13:25,686
Hello. Susan?

868
01:13:26,013 --> 01:13:30,131
Yes. The Charlotte 600
is on Sunday, and...

869
01:13:36,253 --> 01:13:40,132
Let him keep some of the money
to pay his personal obligations?

870
01:13:40,253 --> 01:13:42,687
We can't do that. It's against the rules.

871
01:13:43,773 --> 01:13:45,604
Well, then he won't race.

872
01:13:46,333 --> 01:13:48,164
And he'll sell his stock car.

873
01:13:48,413 --> 01:13:49,846
But he can't do that.

874
01:13:49,933 --> 01:13:53,050
But he will,
unless you agree to his proposition.

875
01:13:53,373 --> 01:13:55,443
If he wins the 600 on Sunday...

876
01:13:55,533 --> 01:13:58,366
we could collect a lot of money
for the government...

877
01:13:58,453 --> 01:14:01,251
plus all the winnings from future races.

878
01:14:02,013 --> 01:14:03,048
Plus?

879
01:14:04,453 --> 01:14:06,808
Well, in that case, all right.

880
01:14:08,333 --> 01:14:12,212
And in the future, Susan,
don't call me at 4 a. M...

881
01:14:12,293 --> 01:14:14,568
unless it's as important as this call.

882
01:14:19,053 --> 01:14:20,088
Bye.

883
01:14:20,533 --> 01:14:21,602
You're the greatest.

884
01:14:21,693 --> 01:14:24,002
You'd better be the greatest
on that track tomorrow.

885
01:14:24,093 --> 01:14:26,243
- And qualify, right?
- Right.

886
01:14:26,413 --> 01:14:29,007
It was nice of you to call Mr. Hepworth.

887
01:14:34,293 --> 01:14:37,251
We're in qualifying for the World 600.

888
01:14:42,333 --> 01:14:43,686
Come on!

889
01:14:43,973 --> 01:14:45,372
Down to the flag.

890
01:14:45,453 --> 01:14:47,444
There's the white flag.

891
01:14:47,893 --> 01:14:50,088
If he puts his hands out,
he'll fly like a bird.

892
01:14:50,493 --> 01:14:54,645
Paul Dado on his first time at 35. 15.

893
01:14:54,853 --> 01:14:57,890
35 seconds and 15 one-hundredths.

894
01:14:58,533 --> 01:14:59,932
- Come on!
- Go!

895
01:15:00,213 --> 01:15:01,646
The checkered flag.

896
01:15:01,893 --> 01:15:03,451
And the time...

897
01:15:03,613 --> 01:15:06,173
It's a beauty! 35.10.

898
01:15:06,413 --> 01:15:07,448
Well?

899
01:15:07,813 --> 01:15:10,805
He qualified. Man, did he ever qualify!

900
01:15:11,013 --> 01:15:12,731
35.10 seconds.

901
01:15:13,173 --> 01:15:16,882
That would be 153.484 miles per hour.

902
01:15:17,533 --> 01:15:18,602
I'll have to stand on it.

903
01:15:18,693 --> 01:15:21,366
That means push the accelerator
to the floor.

904
01:15:21,453 --> 01:15:22,647
I know.

905
01:15:27,533 --> 01:15:30,889
Grayson, always a tough qualifier,
will have to really go.

906
01:15:30,973 --> 01:15:33,771
He's got some real good times to beat.

907
01:15:39,173 --> 01:15:41,050
Right out of Turn 2.

908
01:15:45,213 --> 01:15:46,965
There's the green flag.

909
01:15:47,053 --> 01:15:48,452
Boy, he is really honking.

910
01:15:48,533 --> 01:15:50,763
Time to beat. 35. 10...

911
01:15:50,853 --> 01:15:53,287
to make it into the first four positions.

912
01:15:54,293 --> 01:15:56,090
Out of Turn Number 4.

913
01:15:57,373 --> 01:16:01,207
The white flag. Coming up, the finallap.

914
01:16:01,293 --> 01:16:03,249
The first time around.

915
01:16:03,333 --> 01:16:06,245
The time at 35.05.

916
01:16:06,653 --> 01:16:09,486
That puts Steve Grayson
in the first six cars.

917
01:16:09,773 --> 01:16:11,684
Wide out of the turn...

918
01:16:14,973 --> 01:16:16,565
You're home free.

919
01:16:16,653 --> 01:16:18,052
The checkered flag.

920
01:16:32,173 --> 01:16:35,006
Grab hands, girls. Come on. Let's go.

921
01:16:36,053 --> 01:16:38,647
Steve Grayson climbing out of the 6 car.

922
01:16:38,733 --> 01:16:40,086
He looks all right.

923
01:16:40,173 --> 01:16:43,768
Grayson was really on it
when he came down to the flag.

924
01:16:43,853 --> 01:16:47,448
He made it, even with the spin,
into the first four positions...

925
01:16:47,533 --> 01:16:50,172
with a time of 35.03.

926
01:16:50,253 --> 01:16:52,209
I feel fine. Birdie, did I qualify?

927
01:16:52,293 --> 01:16:55,330
Yeah, you qualified, but you sure
made a clunker out of that car.

928
01:16:55,413 --> 01:16:56,892
Clunker means that...

929
01:16:57,333 --> 01:16:58,686
Well, it's no problem.

930
01:16:58,773 --> 01:17:02,004
Birdie will have it fixed in no time, I hope.

931
01:17:02,093 --> 01:17:04,482
Well, you might as well get started now.

932
01:17:05,173 --> 01:17:06,572
Come on, kids.

933
01:17:16,093 --> 01:17:19,290
I've seen blown engines before, but, boy...

934
01:17:19,373 --> 01:17:22,171
Never mind the details.
Just put another engine in here.

935
01:17:22,253 --> 01:17:24,448
- Speak to Kenny.
- Repossessed.

936
01:17:24,533 --> 01:17:27,252
- All of them?
- I tried to hide one, but I couldn't lift it.

937
01:17:27,333 --> 01:17:31,212
- Can this be fixed by tomorrow?
- We can't fix this in two tomorrows.

938
01:17:31,493 --> 01:17:33,370
They took all our spare parts, too.

939
01:17:33,453 --> 01:17:36,923
We don't even have one spark plug.
What are we gonna do now?

940
01:17:37,013 --> 01:17:39,766
- Why don't you go and buy some?
- With what?

941
01:17:40,253 --> 01:17:42,005
All right, then. Borrow some.

942
01:17:42,093 --> 01:17:45,210
Even if we could borrow the parts,
we couldn't fix it that fast.

943
01:17:45,293 --> 01:17:47,443
How do you know unless you try?

944
01:17:47,733 --> 01:17:49,451
She's right. I think you can do it.

945
01:17:49,533 --> 01:17:51,922
You drive 'em, Steve. We fix 'em.

946
01:17:52,013 --> 01:17:55,130
I tell you this clunker
can't be ready for the race tomorrow.

947
01:17:55,213 --> 01:17:58,888
- What's the first thing to be done?
- Get new engine parts.

948
01:17:59,453 --> 01:18:01,967
I could be a mite helpful
in the parts department.

949
01:18:02,053 --> 01:18:05,489
- Good. I'm glad somebody can help.
- What are we waiting for?

950
01:18:05,613 --> 01:18:07,046
All right, come on.

951
01:19:21,093 --> 01:19:23,129
- Come on.
- Okay.

952
01:19:50,413 --> 01:19:51,766
- Hi.
- Hi.

953
01:19:52,213 --> 01:19:54,488
- Is it all finished?
- All finished.

954
01:19:58,733 --> 01:20:02,248
From the Charlotte Motor Speedway,
the World 600.

955
01:20:05,373 --> 01:20:08,046
The green flag is out, and we're racing!

956
01:20:14,973 --> 01:20:17,533
Into the first turn,
it's a scramble for the first spot.

957
01:20:17,613 --> 01:20:20,286
The 14 car takes over the lead.

958
01:20:20,373 --> 01:20:24,366
It's Paul Dado in car 43 around the outside.

959
01:20:28,253 --> 01:20:31,290
Something's wrong with Steve Grayson...

960
01:20:33,173 --> 01:20:34,845
This is a new one for me.

961
01:20:34,933 --> 01:20:36,286
He's dragging.

962
01:20:36,813 --> 01:20:38,531
Come on, stand on it, Steve.

963
01:20:38,613 --> 01:20:40,410
Grayson can't get up to speed.

964
01:20:40,493 --> 01:20:44,202
We'll keep an eye on him while the rest
of the track is jockeying for position.

965
01:20:44,293 --> 01:20:47,285
The 43 car, Paul Dado,
he's still riding the outside...

966
01:20:47,373 --> 01:20:49,204
picking off car after car.

967
01:20:54,133 --> 01:20:58,206
Still the leader, Car Number 14.
Paul Dado now running second.

968
01:20:58,293 --> 01:21:01,968
Steve Grayson has dropped back
to 12th position and running low.

969
01:21:02,053 --> 01:21:05,329
From here, it looks like Steve Grayson
is having handling problems...

970
01:21:05,413 --> 01:21:08,246
or something is wrong
with the weight distribution.

971
01:21:16,893 --> 01:21:18,849
Come on. You're no feather-foot.

972
01:21:18,933 --> 01:21:20,924
Any of you guys
leave a tool kit in that car?

973
01:21:21,013 --> 01:21:22,731
Paul Dado driving a perfect race...

974
01:21:22,813 --> 01:21:25,611
still picking off cars
and coming up on Grayson.

975
01:21:25,693 --> 01:21:28,526
When he does come around,
he will have lapped the 6 car.

976
01:21:28,613 --> 01:21:32,572
And here he comes on the outside.

977
01:21:32,893 --> 01:21:36,522
There he goes,
and Grayson's now one lap down.

978
01:21:38,053 --> 01:21:41,363
Tough break for Grayson,
the fourth fastest qualifier.

979
01:21:57,533 --> 01:21:59,205
What are you doing here?

980
01:22:00,053 --> 01:22:03,443
After we finished working,
I guess I fell asleep in the car.

981
01:22:03,693 --> 01:22:06,366
Lay down and hang on.
The weight's killing me.

982
01:22:06,453 --> 01:22:07,932
I'll just hang on.

983
01:22:28,213 --> 01:22:31,171
The 6 car heading for the pits.
Still having trouble.

984
01:22:39,133 --> 01:22:41,727
- What's slowing you down?
- Get him out of here.

985
01:22:41,813 --> 01:22:45,203
Holy smoke!
Come on! Let's get him out of there.

986
01:22:50,573 --> 01:22:53,406
- Can you make up the time?
- I've got to. Where am I?

987
01:22:53,493 --> 01:22:55,165
You're way back.

988
01:22:55,293 --> 01:22:57,727
- Get off the track.
- I'm not on the track.

989
01:22:59,133 --> 01:23:00,885
Get him off the track!

990
01:23:10,813 --> 01:23:12,041
You all right?

991
01:23:13,533 --> 01:23:15,125
Am I out of the car?

992
01:23:15,533 --> 01:23:19,162
Steve Grayson in Car Number 6
comes back into the race, one lap down.

993
01:23:21,453 --> 01:23:25,366
The leader in Car Number 4,
Paul Dado in Car Number 43.

994
01:23:27,453 --> 01:23:31,731
Dado holding the first spot
for the last 192 laps.

995
01:23:31,813 --> 01:23:34,407
And here comes the 6 car, Steve Grayson.

996
01:23:34,493 --> 01:23:35,767
Man, is he moving!

997
01:23:35,853 --> 01:23:38,003
Already, he's picked up four cars.

998
01:23:40,053 --> 01:23:43,363
He'll have to pass the leader,
Paul Dado in Car Number 43...

999
01:23:43,453 --> 01:23:45,364
to be on the same lap.

1000
01:23:49,413 --> 01:23:51,005
Look at this boy go!

1001
01:23:51,093 --> 01:23:54,005
He's going to try it on the outside.
There it is.

1002
01:23:54,093 --> 01:23:57,051
He's on the same lap with the leader
and pulls away.

1003
01:24:10,653 --> 01:24:13,770
Car Number 6 is passing cars
at almost record speed.

1004
01:24:16,093 --> 01:24:18,084
We've got him on the last lap...

1005
01:24:18,333 --> 01:24:22,212
at 149.06 miles per hour.

1006
01:24:22,293 --> 01:24:24,602
That should be a great credit to his crew.

1007
01:24:26,133 --> 01:24:30,411
Already, he's made up three-quarters
of a lap, and he's looking for the leader.

1008
01:24:37,533 --> 01:24:40,286
Here he is behind Car Number 43...

1009
01:24:41,133 --> 01:24:43,328
hitting the wall, trying to get by...

1010
01:24:43,413 --> 01:24:44,687
and he made it.

1011
01:24:45,213 --> 01:24:48,171
Steve Grayson in Car Number 6.
That's your new leader.

1012
01:25:02,813 --> 01:25:06,567
Grayson has been holding the lead now
for the last hour-and-one-half...

1013
01:25:06,653 --> 01:25:11,169
riding the high groove and pulling away
as we come to the last five laps.

1014
01:25:11,253 --> 01:25:13,767
Steve Grayson,
after all kinds of problems...

1015
01:25:13,853 --> 01:25:15,889
has made a fantastic recovery.

1016
01:25:16,133 --> 01:25:19,921
He's coming onto the track
one fulllap down. Made up for one lap...

1017
01:25:20,013 --> 01:25:22,322
turning this track at almost record speed...

1018
01:25:22,413 --> 01:25:25,644
to take over the lead
with only three more laps to go.

1019
01:25:25,733 --> 01:25:27,052
The battle is still on.

1020
01:25:27,133 --> 01:25:30,489
Paul Dado in the 43 car
is trying to recover that lead.

1021
01:25:40,133 --> 01:25:42,010
The yellow flag comes down.

1022
01:25:42,173 --> 01:25:45,688
The car losing it in the turn,
Number 88, is okay.

1023
01:25:51,093 --> 01:25:53,084
We're down to the last two laps.

1024
01:25:55,093 --> 01:25:57,607
Please. Come on, Steve.

1025
01:25:57,733 --> 01:25:59,325
One more lap to go.

1026
01:26:01,333 --> 01:26:04,689
It's Grayson and Dado,
they'll race for it right to the wire.

1027
01:26:12,733 --> 01:26:14,644
Both drivers coming out okay.

1028
01:26:15,053 --> 01:26:19,729
Steve Grayson's real steady
with only a half lap to go.

1029
01:26:19,813 --> 01:26:22,122
And the 9 car loses a wheel.

1030
01:26:37,413 --> 01:26:39,847
And this will be your winner.
Paul Dado wins!

1031
01:26:39,933 --> 01:26:41,810
Car Number 43.

1032
01:26:42,813 --> 01:26:46,886
Here comes Grayson out of the car.
And he seems to be all right.

1033
01:26:50,533 --> 01:26:52,251
The fire crew is there.

1034
01:26:52,413 --> 01:26:54,483
Well, race fans, we've seen a beauty.

1035
01:26:56,333 --> 01:26:58,005
Darling...

1036
01:26:58,213 --> 01:26:59,362
you were wonderful.

1037
01:26:59,453 --> 01:27:01,569
- Flat-out all the way.
- A lot of good it did me.

1038
01:27:01,653 --> 01:27:02,881
You tried.

1039
01:27:03,973 --> 01:27:05,850
Steve, I figured it out.

1040
01:27:05,933 --> 01:27:08,891
Counting lap money,
you get $7,670 for third place.

1041
01:27:08,973 --> 01:27:10,645
- How about that?
- That's marvelous!

1042
01:27:10,733 --> 01:27:12,564
That's enough to get you out of trouble.

1043
01:27:12,653 --> 01:27:16,043
We can pay off the furniture,
we can get the station wagon back...

1044
01:27:16,133 --> 01:27:18,522
and we've got $170 to celebrate with.

1045
01:27:20,213 --> 01:27:22,807
$170 goes to Uncle Sam on account.

1046
01:27:22,893 --> 01:27:24,372
On account of what?

1047
01:27:24,853 --> 01:27:29,210
On account of you still owe him $137,000,
plus interest.

1048
01:27:29,293 --> 01:27:30,612
She's right.

1049
01:27:30,693 --> 01:27:34,083
It's back to The Hangout for
the victory dinner. Beans and hot dogs.
