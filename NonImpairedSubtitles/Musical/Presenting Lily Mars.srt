1
00:01:52,695 --> 00:01:54,356
Hello, Charlie.

2
00:01:57,433 --> 00:02:01,062
So be it, Miss Lily Mars.
Have your old career. Go to New York City.

3
00:02:01,237 --> 00:02:04,673
Go on the stage.
All I gotta say is good luck and goodbye.

4
00:02:12,482 --> 00:02:15,178
-Good morning, Charlie.
-Good morning.

5
00:02:25,461 --> 00:02:27,486
-Hello, Charlie.
-I forgot my hat.

6
00:02:27,664 --> 00:02:30,531
-Got any more bubble gum?
-No.

7
00:02:33,870 --> 00:02:36,498
Oh, Lily, Charlie's back!

8
00:02:36,673 --> 00:02:39,506
Lily, Charlie's back already!

9
00:02:39,676 --> 00:02:42,372
-Lily, Lily!
-Lily, Lily!

10
00:02:42,545 --> 00:02:45,275
No, no, I don't wanna see her.
I just want my hat.

11
00:02:45,448 --> 00:02:48,178
-Lily, here's Charlie! Lily!
-Lily!

12
00:02:49,619 --> 00:02:50,984
Davey, have you seen my hat?

13
00:02:51,154 --> 00:02:54,555
I don't collect hats. I collect doorknobs.

14
00:02:54,724 --> 00:02:55,952
Ain't she a beauty?

15
00:02:56,125 --> 00:02:58,559
Oh, Lily, Charlie's back!

16
00:02:58,728 --> 00:03:01,822
I am not. I am not.

17
00:03:02,498 --> 00:03:04,523
Oh, there it is.

18
00:03:05,134 --> 00:03:06,726
Oh, excuse me.

19
00:03:06,903 --> 00:03:08,370
-Hello, Charlie.
-Look, Mama.

20
00:03:08,538 --> 00:03:11,905
Oh, you got it. It's lovely.
Davey, get me the top for this.

21
00:03:12,075 --> 00:03:15,203
-Well, goodbye, Mrs. Mars.
-Goodbye, Charlie.

22
00:03:15,378 --> 00:03:17,903
I'll be sorry not to see you again,
Mrs. Mars.

23
00:03:18,081 --> 00:03:20,174
Oh, now, now, Charlie.

24
00:03:20,350 --> 00:03:22,818
People shouldn't be mad at people.
Goodbye, Charlie.

25
00:03:23,620 --> 00:03:24,848
Charles.

26
00:03:26,189 --> 00:03:28,157
Hey, Charlie, wait for me.

27
00:03:28,324 --> 00:03:32,090
Never again, you-- You actress.

28
00:03:39,202 --> 00:03:41,534
Poor Charles.

29
00:03:42,672 --> 00:03:44,663
He's so young.

30
00:03:44,841 --> 00:03:47,503
So very young.

31
00:03:47,677 --> 00:03:50,475
And it hurts me to hurt him...

32
00:03:52,315 --> 00:03:54,783
...but what can I do?

33
00:03:54,984 --> 00:03:56,713
-Mama.
-Oh, go on, dear.

34
00:03:56,886 --> 00:03:59,650
I'm not laughing at you.
I like to see you act.

35
00:04:00,657 --> 00:04:03,023
-Mother.
-Oh, now, I'm not mother. I'm Mama.

36
00:04:03,192 --> 00:04:04,784
Here's the hat for Mrs. Thornway.

37
00:04:04,961 --> 00:04:07,293
-Davey, where's the top to this?
-Here it is, Mama.

38
00:04:07,463 --> 00:04:10,023
Lily, can I go
to Mrs. Thornway's house with you?

39
00:04:10,199 --> 00:04:12,394
No, Davey, dear.
Her doorknobs might tempt you.

40
00:04:12,568 --> 00:04:13,933
Oh, they already have.

41
00:04:14,103 --> 00:04:16,697
-Lily, please take me.
-No.

42
00:04:16,873 --> 00:04:20,070
Well, then could you sort of
maybe get one for me?

43
00:04:20,243 --> 00:04:24,111
-Of course not.
-Oh, but they're such superdupers.

44
00:04:24,280 --> 00:04:25,838
-All right.
-Here you are, dear.

45
00:04:26,015 --> 00:04:27,607
I may not be back for some time...

46
00:04:27,784 --> 00:04:31,117
...but when I come back, I have
a big surprise for you. That's for luck.

47
00:04:31,287 --> 00:04:32,515
-Good luck.
-Thank you.

48
00:04:32,722 --> 00:04:34,087
-Good luck.
-Thank you, bye.

49
00:04:34,257 --> 00:04:35,485
Goodbye.

50
00:04:40,029 --> 00:04:41,257
Good morning, Miss Lily.

51
00:04:41,431 --> 00:04:44,025
Morning, Andrew.
I brought Mrs. Thornway's hat.

52
00:04:44,200 --> 00:04:46,191
-I'll take it for you.
-Oh, well...

53
00:04:46,369 --> 00:04:48,894
...I know how busy
she must be this morning...

54
00:04:49,072 --> 00:04:52,269
-...but, Andrew, I simply must see her.
-Yeah?

55
00:04:52,442 --> 00:04:54,103
-Yeah, come right in.
-All right.

56
00:04:54,277 --> 00:04:57,269
-She's in the doctor's office.
-Oh, thank you.

57
00:04:58,448 --> 00:05:00,814
Well, I'll tell John just as soon
as he gets here.

58
00:05:00,984 --> 00:05:02,508
Come in, Lily.

59
00:05:02,986 --> 00:05:06,319
Well, he should be here
in a few minutes if his plane's on time.

60
00:05:07,657 --> 00:05:08,988
Yes, Mr. Vail.

61
00:05:09,492 --> 00:05:11,619
Yes, Mr. Vail, I understand.

62
00:05:11,861 --> 00:05:13,658
You and Miss Rekay are motoring here.

63
00:05:13,830 --> 00:05:16,264
You'll arrive early this afternoon.

64
00:05:16,432 --> 00:05:20,129
And you think it would be a good idea
to shoot Irene in the first act.

65
00:05:20,303 --> 00:05:22,703
Yes, I'll tell John. Goodbye.

66
00:05:22,872 --> 00:05:26,330
Mrs. Thornway, I brought your hat.
It isn't exactly what you ordered, but--

67
00:05:26,509 --> 00:05:27,840
Just a minute, Lily.

68
00:05:28,011 --> 00:05:30,138
And wants to shoot--

69
00:05:30,313 --> 00:05:31,940
Oh, bother.

70
00:05:32,115 --> 00:05:33,446
He wants to shoot some girl.

71
00:05:33,616 --> 00:05:35,049
But what girl and in what act?

72
00:05:35,218 --> 00:05:38,051
-Irene in the first act.
-Thank you.

73
00:05:38,221 --> 00:05:40,951
Mrs. Thornway, when you ask your son
about a part for me...

74
00:05:41,124 --> 00:05:43,251
...will you tell him
I'd rather not play Irene.

75
00:05:43,426 --> 00:05:45,986
-You wouldn't?
-Not if she gets killed in the first act.

76
00:05:46,162 --> 00:05:47,993
-Let's see the hat.
-Will you tell him?

77
00:05:48,164 --> 00:05:50,860
If he says no, will you try
and make him give me a part...

78
00:05:51,034 --> 00:05:52,433
...even a little one?

79
00:05:52,602 --> 00:05:55,366
Maybe Irene?

80
00:05:55,538 --> 00:05:59,030
Lily, the last time I was able to make
John Thornway do anything, he was 10.

81
00:05:59,208 --> 00:06:00,539
He wanted to join the circus.

82
00:06:00,710 --> 00:06:03,474
I persuaded him not to
by locking him in the cellar.

83
00:06:03,646 --> 00:06:06,479
Well, if I could just meet him
and maybe act for him a little.

84
00:06:06,649 --> 00:06:09,209
Lily, dear, he's going to be
frightfully busy.

85
00:06:09,385 --> 00:06:11,546
He always is.

86
00:06:12,121 --> 00:06:14,646
Here today to close an old show...

87
00:06:14,824 --> 00:06:16,587
...gone tomorrow to open a new one.

88
00:06:16,759 --> 00:06:17,987
That's John.

89
00:06:18,161 --> 00:06:20,391
Never a minute for anything
but show business.

90
00:06:20,563 --> 00:06:23,031
Well, I'm show business.

91
00:06:23,199 --> 00:06:24,860
My dear, but--

92
00:06:26,302 --> 00:06:28,600
My dear child. Oh, my dear child.

93
00:06:28,771 --> 00:06:33,140
I know you'll love it after you get used to it.
The fashion magazine said it's the latest.

94
00:06:33,309 --> 00:06:36,574
I know-- Oh, well,
I wouldn't cut the feather if I--

95
00:06:38,981 --> 00:06:40,471
That's John. I know his slam.

96
00:06:40,650 --> 00:06:42,049
-Mimi!
-Lily, dear.

97
00:06:42,218 --> 00:06:43,879
Mimi!

98
00:06:44,053 --> 00:06:46,385
-You better wait in here.
-All right.

99
00:06:46,556 --> 00:06:48,956
Don't come out
until I have John nicely buttered up.

100
00:06:49,125 --> 00:06:50,592
All right.

101
00:07:01,270 --> 00:07:03,568
-John.
-Hello, Mimi.

102
00:07:03,739 --> 00:07:06,299
-Welcome home, dear.
-Well, you--

103
00:07:07,443 --> 00:07:10,935
-Do you like it?
-Well, it--

104
00:07:11,114 --> 00:07:13,014
-Do you?
-Yes.

105
00:07:13,182 --> 00:07:15,309
Well, then that's good enough for me.

106
00:07:15,485 --> 00:07:17,646
Oh, Mimi, it's good to see you again.

107
00:07:17,820 --> 00:07:19,720
I hope you had a nice restful trip, dear.

108
00:07:19,889 --> 00:07:23,188
I did. I worked on the script of the new play
from New York to Indiana.

109
00:07:23,359 --> 00:07:25,156
-Any telegrams for me?
-Five so far...

110
00:07:25,328 --> 00:07:27,694
...but the day is young yet.
They're on the desk.

111
00:07:27,864 --> 00:07:29,422
John?

112
00:07:29,866 --> 00:07:32,061
Oh, John, it's beautiful.

113
00:07:32,235 --> 00:07:36,137
-Oh, but, John, you--
-Yes, I know, I know. I shouldn't've done it.

114
00:07:36,305 --> 00:07:38,535
I have a message for you
from Owen Vail.

115
00:07:38,708 --> 00:07:40,232
Oh, he phoned?

116
00:07:40,409 --> 00:07:43,776
Asked me to tell you that Isobel
is not coming by train with the company.

117
00:07:43,946 --> 00:07:46,176
She's motoring here
from Chicago with him.

118
00:07:46,349 --> 00:07:48,112
Oh, well, that's fine.

119
00:07:48,284 --> 00:07:52,084
And Isobel is--
Well, Isobel is Isobel.

120
00:07:52,522 --> 00:07:55,582
Now look, Mimi, I don't care
what Isobel does off the stage.

121
00:07:55,758 --> 00:07:58,352
I love her as an actress.
I adore her as a leading lady.

122
00:07:58,528 --> 00:08:01,224
I'll do anything I can
to keep her happy in the theatre.

123
00:08:01,397 --> 00:08:04,195
But I definitely, flatly,
am not going to humor Miss Rekay...

124
00:08:04,367 --> 00:08:06,835
...by becoming one of her husbands.

125
00:08:13,576 --> 00:08:15,476
John, do you remember Henry Mars?

126
00:08:15,645 --> 00:08:18,580
Used to come here often
to tune the piano.

127
00:08:22,985 --> 00:08:24,646
-That's the man.
-Yeah.

128
00:08:24,820 --> 00:08:27,050
John, he died several years ago.

129
00:08:27,223 --> 00:08:30,283
-He did? I'm sorry to hear that.
-He left a wife and five children.

130
00:08:30,459 --> 00:08:32,586
Nobody knows how they manage,
but they do.

131
00:08:32,762 --> 00:08:37,165
Everybody in Midhaven worries
about the Marses, except the Marses.

132
00:08:37,333 --> 00:08:40,700
The oldest child's name is Lily.

133
00:08:49,378 --> 00:08:50,936
That's Lily.

134
00:08:51,113 --> 00:08:53,479
She's such a remarkable child,
and so talented.

135
00:08:53,649 --> 00:08:55,082
-She acts.
-Yes.

136
00:08:55,251 --> 00:08:56,878
-Experience?
-Oh, loads of it.

137
00:08:57,053 --> 00:08:59,351
<i>-Peter Pan, Macbeth, the Follies.
-Oh, really?</i>

138
00:08:59,522 --> 00:09:02,184
<i>Well, the Midhaven High School Follies.</i>

139
00:09:02,358 --> 00:09:03,985
John. John!

140
00:09:04,694 --> 00:09:05,956
John!

141
00:09:06,128 --> 00:09:09,757
Mimi, there's only one thing in the world
I will not do for you and that is it.

142
00:09:09,932 --> 00:09:12,901
-I have seen my last amateur.
-But Lily's unusual.

143
00:09:13,069 --> 00:09:15,469
Unusual. Oh, Mother.

144
00:09:15,638 --> 00:09:20,007
There's a Lily Mars in every town
and all alike, full of hope and so hopeless.

145
00:09:20,176 --> 00:09:24,044
I'll tell you what you do, Mother. Let her
down easy, but do it so she'll stay down.

146
00:09:24,213 --> 00:09:27,011
She won't. She'll bounce right up again.
You don't know Lily.

147
00:09:27,183 --> 00:09:29,845
-I don't and I'm not going to.
-It won't hurt to meet her.

148
00:09:30,019 --> 00:09:32,419
You can't just meet them.
She'll start acting on me.

149
00:09:32,588 --> 00:09:35,523
-Well, let her play a scene for you.
-Not a scene, not a line...

150
00:09:35,691 --> 00:09:39,627
-...not a word, not a syllable!
-All right, but you'll be sorry.

151
00:09:42,665 --> 00:09:44,030
-Lily, dear.
-It's all right.

152
00:09:44,200 --> 00:09:46,191
You don't have to let me down easy.
I heard.

153
00:09:46,369 --> 00:09:48,496
-I'm sorry.
-He is pigheaded, isn't he?

154
00:09:48,671 --> 00:09:51,299
-Yes.
-Do you mind if I take the box?

155
00:09:51,474 --> 00:09:53,339
-It's the only one we've got.
-Of course.

156
00:09:53,509 --> 00:09:54,874
All right.

157
00:10:07,156 --> 00:10:10,023
Lily. You know,
I'm getting used to the hat.

158
00:10:10,192 --> 00:10:15,095
-It does rather grow on one, doesn't it?
-Oh, yes. I think it's beautiful. I love it.

159
00:10:15,264 --> 00:10:16,856
-It looks lovely on you.
-Thank you.

160
00:10:17,033 --> 00:10:18,933
-Well, goodbye.
-Goodbye.

161
00:10:20,569 --> 00:10:24,938
She sees Stefan, she screams.

162
00:10:25,474 --> 00:10:28,102
That's it. That's it.

163
00:10:29,412 --> 00:10:31,972
Mother! Mother!

164
00:10:32,148 --> 00:10:34,139
-Yes?
-Oh, where is that thing? Where is it?

165
00:10:34,317 --> 00:10:36,342
Mother!

166
00:10:36,886 --> 00:10:38,786
-Where is it? Where is it?
-Where is what?

167
00:10:38,954 --> 00:10:42,014
The play! The play!
It's my only copy with the notes in it.

168
00:10:42,191 --> 00:10:43,920
-It's gone!
-It can't be gone.

169
00:10:44,093 --> 00:10:48,086
-It's gone. I've got to find it! I've got to.
-It won't do any good repeating yourself.

170
00:10:48,264 --> 00:10:51,290
I didn't leave it on the plane.
I didn't leave it in the car.

171
00:10:51,467 --> 00:10:53,697
I'll search the house.

172
00:10:55,571 --> 00:10:59,667
Hello? Yes, this is John Thornway.

173
00:11:00,509 --> 00:11:03,171
Oh, you found it. Where, whe--

174
00:11:03,346 --> 00:11:05,314
In an ash can?

175
00:11:05,481 --> 00:11:07,142
Want it? Of course I want it!

176
00:11:07,316 --> 00:11:08,840
Will you bring it right--?

177
00:11:09,018 --> 00:11:10,713
Will you--? Oh, you can't.

178
00:11:10,886 --> 00:11:13,855
Yes, yes, sure I'll come, but wait a moment.
What's your address?

179
00:11:20,830 --> 00:11:23,856
-Hey. Are you John Thornway?
-Yeah.

180
00:11:24,033 --> 00:11:27,332
-The guy who produces all those shows?
-That's right.

181
00:11:39,749 --> 00:11:41,512
How do you do?

182
00:11:41,684 --> 00:11:44,118
-How do you do? I'm--
-I know who you are.

183
00:11:44,286 --> 00:11:46,550
-Do you know who I am?
-No.

184
00:11:46,722 --> 00:11:49,623
Oh, come right in, please.

185
00:11:55,030 --> 00:11:57,260
I'm in rather a hurry.

186
00:11:57,433 --> 00:12:00,527
Yes, if you'll just come
and sit down, please.

187
00:12:03,372 --> 00:12:06,830
Oh, don't sit there.
Sit here, please.

188
00:12:07,009 --> 00:12:09,102
Please.

189
00:12:30,099 --> 00:12:33,899
<i>Ladies and gentlemen</i>

190
00:12:34,203 --> 00:12:38,196
<i>You've heard of Sarah Bernhardt</i>

191
00:12:38,374 --> 00:12:41,537
<i>She really was a dilly</i>

192
00:12:41,710 --> 00:12:47,740
<i>But Sarah Bernhardt couldn't compare
To the gal who's known as Lily</i>

193
00:12:47,917 --> 00:12:51,409
<i>You've heard of Eleanor Duse</i>

194
00:12:51,887 --> 00:12:54,879
<i>Her drama knocked them silly</i>

195
00:12:55,057 --> 00:13:00,461
<i>But Duse was an amateur
Compared to a gal like Lily</i>

196
00:13:00,629 --> 00:13:01,857
<i>On your mark</i>

197
00:13:02,031 --> 00:13:03,259
<i>Get set</i>

198
00:13:03,432 --> 00:13:08,131
<i>For here comes Lily!</i>

199
00:13:29,225 --> 00:13:32,353
Yet, here's a spot.

200
00:13:32,528 --> 00:13:35,361
Out, damned spot. Out, I say!

201
00:13:36,232 --> 00:13:37,460
One...

202
00:13:38,400 --> 00:13:40,061
...two...

203
00:13:41,270 --> 00:13:45,036
Who would have thought
that the old man had so much blood in him?

204
00:13:45,207 --> 00:13:47,300
Fie, Macbeth!

205
00:13:47,476 --> 00:13:49,205
Fie!

206
00:13:49,378 --> 00:13:52,973
A soldier, and afraid?

207
00:13:54,016 --> 00:13:57,952
What, will these hands never be clean?

208
00:13:58,120 --> 00:14:00,680
But no more of that, my Lord,
no more of that.

209
00:14:00,856 --> 00:14:03,654
Oh, no, no, no.

210
00:14:04,293 --> 00:14:08,161
All the perfumes in Arabia
will not sweeten this little hand.

211
00:14:13,035 --> 00:14:15,469
Look not so pale, Macbeth.

212
00:14:15,638 --> 00:14:20,371
Come, man, put on your nightgown
and come to bed.

213
00:14:20,709 --> 00:14:22,802
To bed.

214
00:14:22,978 --> 00:14:24,843
To bed!

215
00:14:27,316 --> 00:14:29,113
There's a knocking at the gate.

216
00:14:29,285 --> 00:14:31,947
Come, give me your hand.

217
00:14:32,121 --> 00:14:35,750
What is done cannot be undone.

218
00:14:35,925 --> 00:14:37,153
Come.

219
00:14:37,326 --> 00:14:42,025
To bed. To bed. To bed!

220
00:14:46,368 --> 00:14:48,859
How was I, Mr. Thornway?

221
00:14:49,038 --> 00:14:51,438
-Awful.
-Well, what did I do wrong?

222
00:14:51,607 --> 00:14:52,835
Everything.

223
00:14:53,008 --> 00:14:56,171
And now, Miss Mars,
will you please give me back my play.

224
00:14:56,345 --> 00:14:58,210
But I did it exactly as I was told.

225
00:14:59,214 --> 00:15:01,341
You mean somebody told you
to do it that way?

226
00:15:01,517 --> 00:15:04,953
Yes. Professor Eggleston, in school.

227
00:15:05,120 --> 00:15:08,556
Miss Mars, I'm going to talk to you
for one minute...

228
00:15:08,724 --> 00:15:10,885
...quietly but firmly.

229
00:15:11,060 --> 00:15:14,427
I shouldn't, but you're a friend of my
mothers and you come from my town.

230
00:15:14,597 --> 00:15:16,531
And your father
brought me into the world.

231
00:15:16,699 --> 00:15:21,227
That is not one of the qualifications,
Miss Mars, for success on the stage.

232
00:15:21,403 --> 00:15:24,270
I am going to give you
no encouragement whatsoever.

233
00:15:24,440 --> 00:15:26,169
But what I want is a job.

234
00:15:26,342 --> 00:15:31,473
Miss Mars, I give an actress a job
for only one reason...

235
00:15:31,647 --> 00:15:34,912
...and that is that she is the best
I can get for the part.

236
00:15:35,384 --> 00:15:38,444
Miss Mars, I have neither the wish,
the time, nor the patience...

237
00:15:38,621 --> 00:15:40,418
...to teach anybody how to act.

238
00:15:40,589 --> 00:15:43,490
Lady Macbeth is walking in her sleep.

239
00:15:43,659 --> 00:15:47,652
She is talking to herself,
not to a boyfriend in the gallery.

240
00:15:48,464 --> 00:15:50,728
She is a strong woman.

241
00:15:50,899 --> 00:15:55,461
She has murdered a king
so she can become a queen.

242
00:15:56,071 --> 00:16:02,271
But her conscience has crept into her
dreams and is gnawing at her mind.

243
00:16:02,444 --> 00:16:05,436
Gnawing like a relentless rat.

244
00:16:05,614 --> 00:16:07,980
Gnawing, gnawing.

245
00:16:09,551 --> 00:16:13,317
And you play her as if she were
a high school girl with a bellyache.

246
00:16:13,489 --> 00:16:15,480
It is not:

247
00:16:15,658 --> 00:16:19,526
"Come, man, put on your nightgown
and come to bed."

248
00:16:22,865 --> 00:16:24,389
It's:

249
00:16:26,268 --> 00:16:28,202
"Come, man...

250
00:16:28,837 --> 00:16:30,964
...put on your nightgown...

251
00:16:31,140 --> 00:16:32,767
...and come to bed.

252
00:16:34,376 --> 00:16:36,310
There's a knocking at the gate.

253
00:16:37,579 --> 00:16:38,944
Come.

254
00:16:39,915 --> 00:16:42,145
Give me your hand.

255
00:16:42,818 --> 00:16:46,310
What's done cannot be undone."

256
00:16:46,855 --> 00:16:48,880
Oh, bravo!

257
00:16:50,359 --> 00:16:52,725
Bravo!

258
00:16:52,995 --> 00:16:56,658
-Miss Mars, where's my play?
-You've been sitting on it.

259
00:17:20,956 --> 00:17:22,947
That's yours too.

260
00:17:26,895 --> 00:17:28,123
-Mr. Thornway?
-No!

261
00:17:28,297 --> 00:17:30,231
It's not about me,
it's about my brother.

262
00:17:30,399 --> 00:17:34,301
-Does he act too?
-No, he collects doorknobs.

263
00:17:34,470 --> 00:17:38,406
-Doorknobs.
-Yeah, and that was a superduper.

264
00:17:39,641 --> 00:17:41,336
Oh, well, thank you.

265
00:17:45,914 --> 00:17:49,509
Lily, can I blow out the candle?

266
00:17:49,752 --> 00:17:52,220
-He'll be sorry.
-You bet he will.

267
00:17:52,387 --> 00:17:54,014
Thanks for the knob.

268
00:17:54,189 --> 00:17:56,680
Lily, don't feel bad.

269
00:17:56,859 --> 00:17:58,690
I don't feel bad.

270
00:17:58,861 --> 00:18:02,627
I just feel mad. Hopping mad.

271
00:18:06,568 --> 00:18:09,366
Children, children, children.
What's all the fuss about?

272
00:18:09,538 --> 00:18:13,702
We're being hopping mad,
Mama, for Lily.

273
00:18:13,876 --> 00:18:17,039
Well, go be hopping mad
in the dining room. Go on.

274
00:18:18,747 --> 00:18:20,305
Well?

275
00:18:20,749 --> 00:18:22,580
He didn't like me at all.

276
00:18:22,751 --> 00:18:26,653
Perhaps he doesn't like Shakespeare. You
should've done something more lowbrow...

277
00:18:26,822 --> 00:18:30,849
<i>...like Ten Nights in a Bar Room,
or Why Girls Leave Home.</i>

278
00:18:31,026 --> 00:18:34,189
<i>Or that sad scene
from The Secret Bride.</i>

279
00:18:34,363 --> 00:18:36,331
Yes.

280
00:18:37,833 --> 00:18:39,733
No coy little laugh, she just goes.

281
00:18:39,902 --> 00:18:41,733
Yeah? Yeah?

282
00:18:42,237 --> 00:18:44,933
-Excuse me, Mr. John, there's a lady here.
-Shoot her.

283
00:18:45,107 --> 00:18:46,506
I think she's an actress.

284
00:18:53,949 --> 00:18:55,940
Go away, you pest!

285
00:18:56,118 --> 00:18:58,951
What's the matter, Johnny? Let me in!

286
00:18:59,121 --> 00:19:02,022
Isobel. Angel!

287
00:19:02,191 --> 00:19:05,058
Angel. Pest. Pest. Angel.
Make up your mind, Johnny.

288
00:19:05,227 --> 00:19:08,025
Well, it's angel.
I thought you were somebody else.

289
00:19:08,197 --> 00:19:10,062
-A girl?
-No, no, no, a pest.

290
00:19:10,232 --> 00:19:12,359
Well, yes, a girl, but a pest.

291
00:19:12,534 --> 00:19:15,901
-She's been hounding me.
-Johnny, what have you done?

292
00:19:16,071 --> 00:19:17,595
Nothing, not a thing.

293
00:19:17,773 --> 00:19:20,537
And you? I mean, recently?

294
00:19:20,709 --> 00:19:22,734
Nothing but think of you, Johnny.

295
00:19:22,911 --> 00:19:27,507
The lonely weeks on the road, in Buffalo,
Cleveland, Detroit, Cincinnati, Chicago.

296
00:19:27,683 --> 00:19:29,583
Pittsburgh?

297
00:19:29,751 --> 00:19:31,412
Yes, Pittsburgh.

298
00:19:31,587 --> 00:19:34,715
What was that big pig-iron man doing?
Helping you think of me?

299
00:19:34,890 --> 00:19:38,849
Well, I had to have a little fun. Innocent.

300
00:19:39,027 --> 00:19:42,394
It's all right.
You have all the fun you like.

301
00:19:42,564 --> 00:19:46,125
Just don't miss
any more Saturday matinees.

302
00:19:49,438 --> 00:19:52,999
In there you have no heart.
You have a box office. Goodbye.

303
00:19:53,175 --> 00:19:56,076
-Now, now, where you going?
-Pittsburgh!

304
00:19:56,712 --> 00:19:58,179
I don't have to work for you.

305
00:19:58,347 --> 00:20:00,315
I can leave the stage and marry a man...

306
00:20:00,482 --> 00:20:02,507
...with a million dollars worth of pig iron.

307
00:20:02,684 --> 00:20:04,618
Then why don't you?

308
00:20:05,387 --> 00:20:09,289
I don't like pig iron, Johnny.
I like you.

309
00:20:10,726 --> 00:20:12,159
Oh, not bad, John, not bad.

310
00:20:12,327 --> 00:20:15,125
But can't you put a little more oomph?
A little more crunch?

311
00:20:15,297 --> 00:20:16,855
Oh, stop it, Owen.

312
00:20:17,032 --> 00:20:19,899
Owen. Ow-- Owen-- Look...

313
00:20:20,068 --> 00:20:22,969
...you can't shoot Irene
in the first act.

314
00:20:23,138 --> 00:20:24,366
-Second act?
-No, no.

315
00:20:24,539 --> 00:20:27,667
Now, you've written a swell play.
Let it alone.

316
00:20:28,210 --> 00:20:30,770
-When do we go into rehearsal?
-Next week.

317
00:20:30,946 --> 00:20:32,277
All right, now, off with you.

318
00:20:32,447 --> 00:20:36,281
I'll see you back here tonight. Mimi's
tossing a high-class brawl for the troupe.

319
00:20:36,451 --> 00:20:40,751
-Right now I got things to do.
-Oh, Johnny, I want to see your hometown.

320
00:20:40,923 --> 00:20:44,381
And it wants to see you, darling,
tonight, at your best.

321
00:20:44,559 --> 00:20:48,757
So it would be a swell idea if you went on
back to the hotel and took a nice long nap.

322
00:20:48,931 --> 00:20:52,230
Come on, you too, Owen. Bye-bye.

323
00:20:53,869 --> 00:20:56,838
-Goodbye, Johnny.
-Goodbye.

324
00:21:01,143 --> 00:21:04,510
Now let's see.

325
00:21:04,680 --> 00:21:08,582
-Irene enters down left--
-Listen to me. You must. You shall listen.

326
00:21:08,750 --> 00:21:12,618
It's not for my sake,
but for the sake of this poor, innocent child.

327
00:21:12,788 --> 00:21:16,747
Why should she pay for our folly? See?

328
00:21:16,925 --> 00:21:20,554
She has your eyes and your smile
but not your name.

329
00:21:22,230 --> 00:21:25,563
Papa! Papa! Papa!

330
00:21:26,001 --> 00:21:27,764
Papa!

331
00:21:27,936 --> 00:21:30,302
-Could be a racket, you know? It must be.
-Papa!

332
00:21:30,472 --> 00:21:34,772
-That girl's lying.
-But that baby. She's the image of John.

333
00:21:34,943 --> 00:21:38,879
-Papa!
-She does holler like him.

334
00:21:39,915 --> 00:21:42,907
Please, I want nothing for myself,
nothing!

335
00:21:43,085 --> 00:21:47,954
Please. I beg you on bended knee.
Please! Please!

336
00:21:50,959 --> 00:21:53,519
Now, that's enough.
This won't do you one bit of good.

337
00:21:53,695 --> 00:21:55,185
When I say no, I mean no!

338
00:21:55,364 --> 00:21:56,592
-Papa! Papa!
-Shut up!

339
00:21:56,932 --> 00:21:58,627
Papa! Papa! Pa--

340
00:21:58,867 --> 00:22:02,633
Now, go on away, please,
and stop hounding me.

341
00:22:03,105 --> 00:22:07,064
-But, Mr. Thornway--
-Go on, beat it, and take that grubby child.

342
00:22:07,242 --> 00:22:09,335
If you'd just give me a fair chance--

343
00:22:09,511 --> 00:22:11,604
Come here, come here.

344
00:22:11,947 --> 00:22:13,676
Here are a couple of passes for the show.

345
00:22:13,849 --> 00:22:17,046
Go down and see some acting
but for heaven sakes don't do any more.

346
00:22:17,219 --> 00:22:19,847
-Oh, thank you, Mr. Thornway.
-Thank you, Mr. Thornway.

347
00:22:20,022 --> 00:22:24,152
-Got any bubble gum?
-Oh, she just loves bubble gum.

348
00:22:24,893 --> 00:22:28,590
Do you know what I'm gonna do
if I ever catch you anywhere near me again?

349
00:22:28,764 --> 00:22:32,029
-No, Mr. Thornway.
-No, Mr. Thornway.

350
00:22:32,267 --> 00:22:33,859
Now listen carefully, young lady.

351
00:22:34,036 --> 00:22:37,403
-Yes, Mr. Thornway.
-Yes, Mr. Thornway.

352
00:22:37,572 --> 00:22:41,030
I don't care where it is,
or how many other people are there.

353
00:22:41,209 --> 00:22:46,203
I'm gonna take you across my knee
and spank the acting out of you.

354
00:22:47,916 --> 00:22:49,611
Now go on. Beat it.

355
00:22:49,785 --> 00:22:53,118
-Yes, Mr. Thornway.
-Yes, Mr. Thornway.

356
00:22:53,422 --> 00:22:55,947
Go on, beat it!

357
00:23:34,096 --> 00:23:36,587
<i>Could it be the moon</i>

358
00:23:36,765 --> 00:23:42,726
<i>Or the fiddler's tune
Played so dreamily?</i>

359
00:23:42,904 --> 00:23:45,737
<i>Is it really love</i>

360
00:23:45,907 --> 00:23:50,537
<i>Or the Gypsy in me?</i>

361
00:23:53,381 --> 00:23:56,214
<i>Can you tell me why?</i>

362
00:23:56,384 --> 00:24:00,821
<i>Tell me how can I
Solve this mystery?</i>

363
00:24:02,457 --> 00:24:06,655
<i>Is it really love</i>

364
00:24:07,596 --> 00:24:14,593
<i>Or the Gypsy in me?</i>

365
00:24:17,139 --> 00:24:19,232
<i>Not so very long ago</i>

366
00:24:19,407 --> 00:24:22,171
<i>A fortune teller told me</i>

367
00:24:22,344 --> 00:24:25,472
<i>Someday he will come along</i>

368
00:24:25,647 --> 00:24:27,410
<i>And in his arms</i>

369
00:24:27,582 --> 00:24:33,111
<i>He'll hold me</i>

370
00:24:33,555 --> 00:24:39,357
<i>Since we've been apart
I talked to my heart</i>

371
00:24:39,694 --> 00:24:43,357
<i>Both of us agree</i>

372
00:24:43,532 --> 00:24:49,698
<i>This is really love</i>

373
00:24:49,871 --> 00:24:56,868
<i>Not the Gypsy in me</i>

374
00:24:57,045 --> 00:25:01,243
<i>Strike your cymbal
Beat your drum</i>

375
00:25:01,416 --> 00:25:04,943
<i>Hold back the dawn
And may tomorrow never come</i>

376
00:25:05,120 --> 00:25:08,112
<i>Play Zigeuner, play till dawn</i>

377
00:25:08,290 --> 00:25:11,157
<i>Play it faster till at last a rhapsody is born</i>

378
00:25:50,899 --> 00:25:56,462
<i>I know how I fell
Underneath the spell of this melody</i>

379
00:25:56,638 --> 00:26:00,335
<i>This is really love</i>

380
00:26:00,942 --> 00:26:07,177
<i>Not the Gypsy</i>

381
00:26:08,683 --> 00:26:14,713
<i>In</i>

382
00:26:20,495 --> 00:26:23,362
<i>Me!</i>

383
00:26:35,277 --> 00:26:38,405
Supper is served. Supper is served.

384
00:26:38,580 --> 00:26:40,309
Lily, let's go home.

385
00:26:40,482 --> 00:26:41,710
Not yet.

386
00:26:41,883 --> 00:26:44,545
Then let's go someplace
and have a hamburger.

387
00:26:44,719 --> 00:26:47,313
Boost. Boost.

388
00:26:47,489 --> 00:26:49,480
Come on, Charlie. Boost.

389
00:26:49,658 --> 00:26:51,057
Boost!

390
00:27:02,370 --> 00:27:05,703
You must try coming in through the door
sometime. It's so much simpler.

391
00:27:05,874 --> 00:27:08,274
Yes, if you're invited.

392
00:27:08,877 --> 00:27:12,608
You're Mr. Owen Vail, the man who
writes such wonderful plays, aren't you?

393
00:27:12,781 --> 00:27:16,717
Well, I'm Lily Mars. And you can do
so much for me if you only will.

394
00:27:16,885 --> 00:27:19,786
It's no good my talking to Mr. Thornway,
he won't listen to me.

395
00:27:19,954 --> 00:27:22,184
He will to you
and if you spoke to him about--

396
00:27:22,357 --> 00:27:23,619
Wait!

397
00:27:28,163 --> 00:27:31,758
Why, it's-- It's the-- You're the girl that--

398
00:27:34,469 --> 00:27:36,300
-What's the matter?
-Tell me this:

399
00:27:36,471 --> 00:27:39,235
Has John Thornway
never done anything for you?

400
00:27:39,407 --> 00:27:42,501
-No, never.
-Well, what reason does he give?

401
00:27:42,677 --> 00:27:44,235
He doesn't like me.

402
00:27:44,412 --> 00:27:46,209
He doesn't like--

403
00:27:47,482 --> 00:27:49,109
You wait right here.

404
00:27:49,284 --> 00:27:50,649
But, Mr. Vail.

405
00:27:51,019 --> 00:27:53,180
-Mr. Vail.
-Stay there.

406
00:27:53,355 --> 00:27:55,016
You will speak to Mr. Thornway?

407
00:27:55,190 --> 00:27:57,021
Don't you think
it's time you called him John?

408
00:27:57,192 --> 00:27:59,854
Has anyone seen Mr. Vail?

409
00:28:00,128 --> 00:28:02,255
There you are, Mr. Vail,
I was looking for you.

410
00:28:02,430 --> 00:28:04,557
Supper's served. Come on. Both of you.

411
00:28:05,166 --> 00:28:06,963
There's only one of us.

412
00:28:07,135 --> 00:28:09,365
I heard a girl's voice.

413
00:28:10,171 --> 00:28:12,264
-No, that was me.
-You?

414
00:28:12,440 --> 00:28:16,536
-Oh, yes. I often talk to myself.
-Soprano?

415
00:28:18,146 --> 00:28:19,374
Sometimes.

416
00:28:20,048 --> 00:28:23,313
Oh, it's me, Lily, Mrs. Thornway.

417
00:28:23,818 --> 00:28:25,046
Why, Lily Mars.

418
00:28:25,220 --> 00:28:27,780
-Come in, dear.
-Oh, no, I don't think I'd better.

419
00:28:27,956 --> 00:28:29,685
Nonsense, we'd love to have you.

420
00:28:29,858 --> 00:28:32,156
Oh, I don't think your son would.

421
00:28:32,327 --> 00:28:35,558
-I guess he must have told you about--
-About that?

422
00:28:35,730 --> 00:28:37,425
Don't let that worry you anymore.

423
00:28:37,599 --> 00:28:39,931
Things like that don't upset John
for very long.

424
00:28:40,101 --> 00:28:42,092
Come on. Come in, Mr. Vail.

425
00:28:44,339 --> 00:28:46,398
Don't upset him?

426
00:28:50,478 --> 00:28:52,912
-Now make yourself perfectly at home.
-Thank you.

427
00:28:53,081 --> 00:28:54,946
-Good evening, Lily.
-Good evening, Lily.

428
00:28:55,116 --> 00:28:57,414
-Excuse me.
-Good evening, Professor Eggleston.

429
00:28:57,585 --> 00:29:03,421
-My dear, Lily. Delighted to see you.
-Thank you.

430
00:29:03,858 --> 00:29:05,086
How are the children?

431
00:29:05,460 --> 00:29:08,054
Three of the--
Three of them had the mumps...

432
00:29:08,229 --> 00:29:12,097
...but they're fine for now, thank goodness.
Excuse me.

433
00:29:12,434 --> 00:29:15,665
-Did he say children?
-Well, yes.

434
00:29:16,704 --> 00:29:18,569
Wait right here.

435
00:29:23,011 --> 00:29:25,878
Miss Rekay, I saw your show,
and your Gypsy number--

436
00:29:26,047 --> 00:29:28,880
-Excuse me. Excuse me. Where's John?
-Where is John?

437
00:29:29,050 --> 00:29:30,915
-That girl is here.
-Girl? What girl?

438
00:29:31,085 --> 00:29:34,885
-What girl?
-You mean--? Did she bring--?

439
00:29:35,056 --> 00:29:38,253
No. And it seems there's not just one.
There are:

440
00:29:38,426 --> 00:29:40,121
-Three?
-At least. Maybe:

441
00:29:40,295 --> 00:29:41,990
Four.

442
00:29:43,031 --> 00:29:44,658
Well, can I play too?

443
00:29:44,833 --> 00:29:47,028
-What is this, a new game?
-No. An old one.

444
00:29:47,202 --> 00:29:49,864
John, you've simply got to do
something about that girl.

445
00:29:50,038 --> 00:29:52,063
-What girl?
-"What girl? " Lily Mars.

446
00:29:53,608 --> 00:29:56,771
Has she been working on you too?
Don't pay any attention to her.

447
00:29:56,945 --> 00:29:58,742
-You did.
-Not a great deal.

448
00:29:58,913 --> 00:30:02,246
-I simply told her what I tell all the others.
-Others?

449
00:30:02,417 --> 00:30:06,751
Yes. There's at least one in every town.
But why are you interested in this one?

450
00:30:06,921 --> 00:30:09,014
-I've seen this one.
-And the child.

451
00:30:09,190 --> 00:30:10,953
-One of them.
-This afternoon.

452
00:30:11,125 --> 00:30:13,355
Outside your window.

453
00:30:14,929 --> 00:30:20,959
Well, you low-minded snoopers. Of all--
You ought to be ashamed of yourselves.

454
00:30:21,236 --> 00:30:23,033
She's one of those stage-struck kids...

455
00:30:23,204 --> 00:30:26,435
...that thinks all she has to do
to be an actress is make a wish.

456
00:30:26,608 --> 00:30:30,476
I told her
if she ever bothered me again, I-- I--

457
00:30:37,352 --> 00:30:39,217
Excuse me.

458
00:31:07,282 --> 00:31:08,840
John.

459
00:31:09,017 --> 00:31:12,976
Oh, John. Just a moment.
Will you autograph my program?

460
00:31:13,154 --> 00:31:15,019
Yes, I'd be delighted.

461
00:31:15,189 --> 00:31:16,713
-Such beautiful music.
-Marvelous.

462
00:31:16,891 --> 00:31:18,483
-For you.
-Thank you.

463
00:31:18,660 --> 00:31:20,787
-Thank you.
-Yes, thank you.

464
00:31:27,435 --> 00:31:29,164
Thank you.

465
00:31:40,648 --> 00:31:44,209
<i>And hit the hit parade
It was growing pop</i>

466
00:31:44,385 --> 00:31:45,784
<i>And it couldn't stop</i>

467
00:31:46,921 --> 00:31:48,218
<i>Now it's number one</i>

468
00:31:48,389 --> 00:31:52,485
<i>Thanks to Tom, the piper's son</i>

469
00:31:52,660 --> 00:31:54,992
<i>Tom, Tom, the piper's son</i>

470
00:31:55,163 --> 00:32:00,362
<i>He's stole a tune and away he run
And away run he</i>

471
00:32:00,535 --> 00:32:02,765
<i>With that melody</i>

472
00:32:03,338 --> 00:32:08,173
<i>Tom was hot, the tune was sweet
But he revamped it with a new offbeat</i>

473
00:32:08,343 --> 00:32:10,834
<i>And the classic thing</i>

474
00:32:11,012 --> 00:32:13,480
<i>Got a shot of swing</i>

475
00:32:13,648 --> 00:32:16,048
<i>Mr. Brahms cried "Ach "</i>

476
00:32:16,217 --> 00:32:18,742
<i>So did Mozart and Bach</i>

477
00:32:18,920 --> 00:32:21,445
<i>And to hear them rave</i>

478
00:32:21,623 --> 00:32:24,456
<i>Paganini tumbled over in his grave</i>

479
00:32:24,626 --> 00:32:29,791
<i>And now that tune that no one played
Has stepped right up and hit the hit parade</i>

480
00:32:29,964 --> 00:32:32,159
<i>It was growing pop</i>

481
00:32:32,333 --> 00:32:33,891
<i>And it couldn't stop!</i>

482
00:32:34,969 --> 00:32:39,201
<i>Now it's number one
Thanks to Tom, the piper's son</i>

483
00:32:39,374 --> 00:32:42,969
-Once more, please. By special request.
-It's all right with me. Keep singing.

484
00:32:43,144 --> 00:32:45,578
<i>Tom, Tom the piper's son</i>

485
00:32:45,747 --> 00:32:50,480
<i>Stole a tune and away he run
And away run he</i>

486
00:32:50,652 --> 00:32:53,587
<i>With that melody</i>

487
00:32:53,755 --> 00:32:58,351
<i>Tom was hot, the tune was sweet
But he vamped it with a boogie beat</i>

488
00:32:58,526 --> 00:33:03,623
<i>And the classic thing
Got a shot of swing</i>

489
00:33:03,798 --> 00:33:05,663
<i>Beethoven turned gray</i>

490
00:33:05,833 --> 00:33:09,030
<i>So did, did Debussy and Bizet</i>

491
00:33:09,203 --> 00:33:11,797
<i>It was such a stew</i>

492
00:33:11,973 --> 00:33:14,737
<i>Tschai-- Tschaikovsky said
"I'm gonna sue"</i>

493
00:33:14,909 --> 00:33:17,434
<i>And now that tune that no one played</i>

494
00:33:17,612 --> 00:33:19,910
<i>Has stepped right up
And hit the hit parade</i>

495
00:33:20,081 --> 00:33:22,049
<i>It was growing pop</i>

496
00:33:22,583 --> 00:33:24,346
<i>And it couldn't stop</i>

497
00:33:25,186 --> 00:33:33,651
<i>Now it's number one
Thanks to Tom, the piper's son</i>

498
00:33:42,136 --> 00:33:45,799
I do hope Mr. Thornway
will do something for Lily.

499
00:33:45,973 --> 00:33:48,806
-Oh, I think he will.
-Good. Good.

500
00:33:49,577 --> 00:33:53,274
I guess you were kind of surprised
to see me pop up here tonight, weren't you?

501
00:33:53,448 --> 00:33:58,078
I was. I shouldn't have been knowing
what a talent you have for popping up.

502
00:33:58,753 --> 00:34:01,187
But I didn't see you come in.

503
00:34:03,157 --> 00:34:07,287
I didn't exactly come in.
You see, I came over the wall.

504
00:34:07,462 --> 00:34:10,260
And just where did you...?

505
00:34:10,431 --> 00:34:12,160
Right over there.

506
00:34:12,767 --> 00:34:15,998
That's right where you going to:

507
00:34:16,537 --> 00:34:18,767
But when I was singing,
you looked so interested.

508
00:34:18,940 --> 00:34:20,805
-I am not.
-So human.

509
00:34:20,975 --> 00:34:27,175
I am not. Now, Miss Mars,
this way out. Please.

510
00:34:27,348 --> 00:34:30,511
Mr. Thornway, please take me to New York
with you tomorrow.

511
00:34:30,685 --> 00:34:32,585
I can do so much
for Mama and the kids.

512
00:34:32,754 --> 00:34:35,314
You might start by washing
that grubby little sister.

513
00:34:35,490 --> 00:34:39,517
Poppy is not grubby.
She was made-up for the part.

514
00:34:39,694 --> 00:34:41,685
Miss Mars.

515
00:34:42,263 --> 00:34:45,323
Very well. If you really want me to go.

516
00:34:45,500 --> 00:34:49,300
I do, Miss Mars. I do very much.

517
00:34:49,470 --> 00:34:53,099
All right, over I go.
But you're gonna have to boost me.

518
00:34:53,741 --> 00:34:55,675
Come on, boost.

519
00:34:58,179 --> 00:34:59,476
You're afraid of me.

520
00:34:59,647 --> 00:35:01,581
-I'm what?
-You are.

521
00:35:01,749 --> 00:35:03,876
Well, that's one thing
I didn't know till now.

522
00:35:04,051 --> 00:35:06,611
There are a lot of things
you don't know about yourself.

523
00:35:06,788 --> 00:35:09,916
One of them is why you're making me
go back over that wall.

524
00:35:11,159 --> 00:35:15,994
Well, that is one thing I do know,
young lady, it's to teach you a lesson.

525
00:35:16,531 --> 00:35:19,193
Just like a naughty little girl.

526
00:35:19,400 --> 00:35:22,198
I know why you treat me as a child...

527
00:35:22,570 --> 00:35:25,903
...it's because you're afraid
to think of me as a woman.

528
00:35:26,707 --> 00:35:28,698
All right, boost.

529
00:35:34,982 --> 00:35:37,246
One, two.

530
00:35:42,657 --> 00:35:44,284
Goodbye.

531
00:35:51,265 --> 00:35:53,028
I beg your pardon.

532
00:36:36,878 --> 00:36:39,278
What's the matter, Lily?

533
00:36:39,447 --> 00:36:42,644
-Nothing.
-Don't cry, Lily.

534
00:36:42,817 --> 00:36:44,978
I hate him. I just hate him.

535
00:36:45,152 --> 00:36:47,620
I hate him too.

536
00:36:48,389 --> 00:36:50,584
Who does she hate?

537
00:36:51,592 --> 00:36:53,321
Children. Children.

538
00:36:53,494 --> 00:36:57,487
Now, now, now. It isn't as bad as all
that no matter how bad it is.

539
00:36:57,665 --> 00:36:59,155
Why are you crying?

540
00:36:59,333 --> 00:37:02,029
Because Lily is.

541
00:37:02,203 --> 00:37:03,602
Lily, why are you crying?

542
00:37:04,839 --> 00:37:08,036
Mr. Thornway wouldn't give me a job...

543
00:37:08,209 --> 00:37:10,177
...and he sneered at me...

544
00:37:10,344 --> 00:37:13,973
...and he told me to go home
and wash my grubby little sister.

545
00:37:14,148 --> 00:37:15,775
Me?

546
00:37:15,983 --> 00:37:18,611
And he made me climb
back over the wall.

547
00:37:18,886 --> 00:37:22,049
Well, Lily, dear,
that's nothing for you to cry about.

548
00:37:22,223 --> 00:37:23,918
Were you mean to him?

549
00:37:25,593 --> 00:37:26,924
Did you sneer at him?

550
00:37:28,262 --> 00:37:29,820
Did you call him grubby?

551
00:37:29,997 --> 00:37:32,431
Did you make him climb a wall?

552
00:37:32,667 --> 00:37:34,692
Well, then. Who should be ashamed?

553
00:37:34,969 --> 00:37:37,733
-Him.
-Right. Who should be crying?

554
00:37:37,905 --> 00:37:40,203
-Him.
-And if you shouldn't be crying...

555
00:37:40,374 --> 00:37:42,433
...what should you be doing?

556
00:37:44,111 --> 00:37:47,080
-Laughing.
-That's right.

557
00:37:47,248 --> 00:37:51,912
Now then, off to bed all of you.
Come on, laugh yourselves to sleep. Scoot.

558
00:37:52,119 --> 00:37:55,611
Mama, when I grow up can I be you?

559
00:37:55,790 --> 00:37:58,054
I'll try and arrange it.

560
00:37:58,659 --> 00:38:00,354
Now scoot.

561
00:38:03,331 --> 00:38:07,927
Lily, you're something
that's very wonderful to be.

562
00:38:10,538 --> 00:38:13,439
-What, Mama?
-Nineteen.

563
00:38:13,874 --> 00:38:16,274
Nineteen and nowhere.

564
00:38:17,345 --> 00:38:21,577
Some very successful people
didn't get their start until well past 20.

565
00:38:21,749 --> 00:38:24,684
Right now it looks
like I'm gonna be well past everything...

566
00:38:24,852 --> 00:38:27,912
...before I get my chance to do
what I've always dreamed of doing.

567
00:38:29,390 --> 00:38:33,759
Being an actress, and a good one too.

568
00:38:33,928 --> 00:38:36,522
I could give you and the kids
all the things you want.

569
00:38:36,697 --> 00:38:39,029
I've got what I want.

570
00:38:39,266 --> 00:38:41,894
What you want's in New York, isn't it?

571
00:38:42,870 --> 00:38:44,997
And you're in Indiana.

572
00:38:46,507 --> 00:38:50,238
Well, if you want to get what you want,
you've got to go where it is, don't you?

573
00:38:51,312 --> 00:38:52,540
Well, then.

574
00:38:52,713 --> 00:38:54,704
Davey? Davey!

575
00:38:54,882 --> 00:38:56,747
Yes, Mama?

576
00:38:56,917 --> 00:38:59,317
Get George and bring him here to me.

577
00:38:59,487 --> 00:39:01,216
-I'm not gonna let--
-You will too.

578
00:39:01,389 --> 00:39:04,552
-Let's have no fiddle-de-dee about this.
-But, Mama, I can't--

579
00:39:04,725 --> 00:39:08,957
Here. I got it. I was sound asleep.

580
00:39:09,130 --> 00:39:12,293
-Here's George, Mama.
-Thank you, Davey. Now run along.

581
00:39:12,466 --> 00:39:15,299
-Good night.
-Good night, dear.

582
00:39:17,138 --> 00:39:19,368
Now you're going to take this
and go to New York.

583
00:39:19,540 --> 00:39:20,905
It's only $28.

584
00:39:21,075 --> 00:39:25,535
-But I just can't--
-Who's Mama around here?

585
00:39:26,380 --> 00:39:28,007
Good night, dear.

586
00:39:51,505 --> 00:39:53,166
Davey?

587
00:39:53,774 --> 00:39:55,435
Davey?

588
00:39:57,144 --> 00:40:01,342
I want you to put this money in George,
but don't let Mama see you do it.

589
00:40:01,515 --> 00:40:04,848
Can't you put the money in George?

590
00:40:06,153 --> 00:40:08,280
I won't be here.

591
00:40:09,356 --> 00:40:11,324
Oh, not now, dear.

592
00:40:11,559 --> 00:40:13,720
You can do it tomorrow.

593
00:40:33,347 --> 00:40:36,316
All right, girls. Places for the finale.

594
00:40:37,284 --> 00:40:39,377
-Excuse me, but--
-Excuse me, but...

595
00:40:39,553 --> 00:40:40,884
Where did you get that hat?

596
00:40:42,857 --> 00:40:47,191
It's a copy. I made it myself.
Ninety-eight cents.

597
00:40:47,361 --> 00:40:49,761
-Can I go in with you?
-Are you in the show?

598
00:40:49,930 --> 00:40:53,024
No, not yet.
I just got to New York today, but--

599
00:40:53,200 --> 00:40:56,226
Sorry, honey, but Thorny
has a strict rule against visitors.

600
00:40:56,403 --> 00:40:59,998
Well, come on. Snap your shirttails.
What is this?

601
00:41:04,645 --> 00:41:06,977
-What's cooking, Mike?
-Hi, Mike, what do you know?

602
00:41:07,148 --> 00:41:09,412
-Hi, Mike. What do you know?
-Everybody but you.

603
00:41:09,583 --> 00:41:11,676
Oh, well, it's perfectly all right.

604
00:41:11,852 --> 00:41:15,549
You see, I know Mister--
I know Thorny.

605
00:41:15,723 --> 00:41:17,122
Do you, now?

606
00:41:17,291 --> 00:41:20,624
-His father brought me into the world.
-Did he, now?

607
00:41:20,794 --> 00:41:25,163
Well, if you bother the son during rehearsal,
he'll do just the opposite for you.

608
00:41:25,666 --> 00:41:28,134
-Well, thank you anyway.
-Young lady...

609
00:41:28,302 --> 00:41:32,830
...if you wanna see Mr. Thornway,
why don't you send your name in to him?

610
00:41:33,007 --> 00:41:35,373
Because I wanna see him.

611
00:41:35,910 --> 00:41:38,174
Lady, that does not make sense.

612
00:41:38,345 --> 00:41:39,812
It does to me.

613
00:41:39,980 --> 00:41:43,916
You see, we had kind
of a misunderstanding.

614
00:41:44,084 --> 00:41:45,779
He doesn't know I'm here.

615
00:41:45,953 --> 00:41:50,617
So why don't you let me go right on in
and surprise him--?

616
00:41:51,058 --> 00:41:55,461
I'm sorry, lady. You can't surprise
Mr. Thornway. Only by appointment.

617
00:41:55,629 --> 00:41:58,189
Now, get off with you now.

618
00:42:04,038 --> 00:42:05,471
Well.

619
00:42:05,639 --> 00:42:07,971
-Here?
-That's right.

620
00:42:08,742 --> 00:42:11,336
Darling, I want you to always wear
that hat to rehearsal.

621
00:42:11,512 --> 00:42:15,380
-Everything goes well when you do.
-Certainly. It's my lucky hat.

622
00:42:43,544 --> 00:42:46,809
Excuse me.
But could you tell me where Mr. Tho--

623
00:43:03,197 --> 00:43:06,758
So you wiggled in, did you?
Wiggle out now, wiggle out now, or I'll--

624
00:43:06,934 --> 00:43:09,334
-Mike!
-Miss Rekay.

625
00:43:09,503 --> 00:43:11,596
I thought you were,
but you weren't, were you?

626
00:43:11,772 --> 00:43:14,502
Excuse me, I apologize.
I beg your pardon.

627
00:43:14,675 --> 00:43:17,906
I'm-- I'm sorry. I--

628
00:43:20,114 --> 00:43:21,672
What's the matter with Mike?

629
00:43:21,849 --> 00:43:24,443
I'm afraid he's been drinking.

630
00:43:24,652 --> 00:43:27,177
Shouldn't do that.
That sets a bad example.

631
00:43:27,354 --> 00:43:29,447
Come on, let's follow it.

632
00:43:40,301 --> 00:43:42,826
All right, girls.
Come on, line up for the last number.

633
00:43:43,003 --> 00:43:45,267
Owen, coming with us?

634
00:43:45,439 --> 00:43:47,100
-Nope.
-For a drink?

635
00:43:47,274 --> 00:43:49,174
Yeah!

636
00:43:51,011 --> 00:43:52,273
Mister--?

637
00:43:52,446 --> 00:43:56,007
Come on, this is a Russian number, girls.
Move. Move.

638
00:43:56,984 --> 00:44:03,287
<i>At the Club Tovaritch
There is romance in the air</i>

639
00:44:05,125 --> 00:44:07,150
<i>Love is everywhere!</i>

640
00:44:07,328 --> 00:44:13,927
<i>When you hear the balalaika
You had best beware</i>

641
00:44:15,936 --> 00:44:17,927
<i>Everyone is there!</i>

642
00:44:38,926 --> 00:44:42,623
Say. Say! Wake up! Wake up!

643
00:44:49,737 --> 00:44:51,170
What happened? Get locked in?

644
00:44:52,906 --> 00:44:54,601
Yes, ma'am...

645
00:44:55,175 --> 00:44:56,403
...but I wanted to be.

646
00:44:57,811 --> 00:45:00,541
Sorry, but there's no sleeping permitted
in this theatre.

647
00:45:01,014 --> 00:45:04,609
-But I haven't got any place to--
-Out. Out.

648
00:45:06,720 --> 00:45:08,688
All right.

649
00:45:11,625 --> 00:45:15,322
I'll find some other way
to see Mr. Thornway.

650
00:45:17,297 --> 00:45:22,428
-Well, goodbye.
-Say, wait a minute.

651
00:45:23,170 --> 00:45:25,468
Is it about a job?

652
00:45:25,639 --> 00:45:27,470
Where you from?

653
00:45:27,741 --> 00:45:30,005
-Indiana.
-How old?

654
00:45:30,177 --> 00:45:33,738
-Nineteen.
-I'm from Nebraska. I was 16.

655
00:45:33,914 --> 00:45:37,145
There's a boy back home
who wants to marry you.

656
00:45:37,317 --> 00:45:40,684
The one who wanted to marry me
was a fine young fella.

657
00:45:40,854 --> 00:45:42,719
The kind who was sure to get ahead.

658
00:45:42,890 --> 00:45:45,017
Yeah, that's Charlie.

659
00:45:45,192 --> 00:45:47,922
That was Sam. And he did all right too.

660
00:45:48,095 --> 00:45:50,120
Now he's the big man out that way.

661
00:45:50,297 --> 00:45:54,495
Everybody said I was an awful fool
not to stay home and marry Sam.

662
00:45:54,668 --> 00:45:58,069
But there was something I wanted more
than him, or anybody or anything.

663
00:45:58,238 --> 00:46:00,900
And that was to go on the stage.

664
00:46:01,208 --> 00:46:02,436
Well, where am I?

665
00:46:03,644 --> 00:46:05,236
Gee.

666
00:46:05,412 --> 00:46:07,403
And you've been trying
since you were 16?

667
00:46:07,581 --> 00:46:10,550
Bless your heart, child,
I didn't start with a broom.

668
00:46:10,717 --> 00:46:13,311
First I carried a spear.

669
00:46:15,889 --> 00:46:18,187
Then the third year I got a line to speak:

670
00:46:18,358 --> 00:46:21,589
"Madame, dinner is served."

671
00:46:25,666 --> 00:46:28,362
Oh, then there were a lot of years,
and a lot of shows.

672
00:46:28,535 --> 00:46:29,763
And a husband or two.

673
00:46:29,937 --> 00:46:32,337
And then there was a song
that got to be my song.

674
00:46:33,540 --> 00:46:35,531
That was all before your time.

675
00:46:35,709 --> 00:46:38,007
-What's your name?
-Lily Mars.

676
00:46:38,946 --> 00:46:40,641
Lily, know what you are?

677
00:46:41,615 --> 00:46:42,843
Foolish?

678
00:46:43,750 --> 00:46:47,709
You're me. The same eager,
hopeful, stage-struck little hick...

679
00:46:47,888 --> 00:46:51,881
...I was half a century ago,
with the same question to answer.

680
00:46:52,059 --> 00:46:54,619
What do you want?

681
00:46:54,795 --> 00:46:57,491
I wanna be an actress.

682
00:46:58,699 --> 00:47:00,257
Know what I'd do if I were you?

683
00:47:02,202 --> 00:47:03,430
Go home?

684
00:47:04,771 --> 00:47:07,262
Lily, I think you are home.

685
00:47:08,141 --> 00:47:10,769
I know I am, and I'd rather be here...

686
00:47:10,944 --> 00:47:14,971
...even doing what I'm doing,
than be anywhere else on earth.

687
00:47:15,148 --> 00:47:16,775
Because...

688
00:47:16,950 --> 00:47:19,384
...this is where I belong.

Hi!

748
00:53:12,606 --> 00:53:16,702
-You. Come here.
-Hello.

749
00:53:17,110 --> 00:53:19,704
Mr. Thornway, I'm sorry. I--

750
00:53:23,950 --> 00:53:25,918
-Keep the change.
-Thank you, Mr. Thornway.

751
00:53:26,086 --> 00:53:29,852
Thank you very much for the lunch.
It was the best I ever had and the biggest.

752
00:53:30,023 --> 00:53:33,652
-That long train ride gave you an appetite.
-Train?

753
00:53:35,028 --> 00:53:37,496
And spending all night in a theater
isn't nourishing.

754
00:53:37,664 --> 00:53:39,029
I guess not.

755
00:53:42,936 --> 00:53:44,460
-Aren't they--?
-Miss Mars...

756
00:53:44,638 --> 00:53:47,732
...let's get something settled
once and for all.

757
00:53:47,908 --> 00:53:51,435
I'm letting you stay in the show
only because:

758
00:53:51,611 --> 00:53:53,579
You knew my father.

759
00:53:53,747 --> 00:53:55,339
You know my mother.

760
00:53:55,515 --> 00:53:57,847
You come from my hometown.

761
00:53:58,184 --> 00:54:00,948
You're in New York in need of a job.

762
00:54:03,790 --> 00:54:06,418
Well, I needed a few more girls
in the show anyway.

763
00:54:06,593 --> 00:54:09,221
I wish there was some way
I could show my appreciation.

764
00:54:09,396 --> 00:54:11,626
-There is. Just do your job.
-Oh, I will.

765
00:54:11,798 --> 00:54:14,528
Now, some of the girls
live in a boarding house...

766
00:54:14,701 --> 00:54:18,694
...they've affectionately dubbed the
"Incubator". It's reasonable, respectable.

767
00:54:20,674 --> 00:54:23,666
But where you live or what you do
outside of the theater...

768
00:54:23,843 --> 00:54:26,073
...is strictly your own affair.

769
00:54:27,981 --> 00:54:29,915
Miss Mars, you understand, don't you?

770
00:54:30,083 --> 00:54:34,543
Absolutely. You want me to live
in an incubator and not to bother you.

771
00:54:34,754 --> 00:54:37,746
Yes, yeah, that's the gist of it.

772
00:54:37,924 --> 00:54:40,688
So starting right now,
you're strictly on your own.

773
00:54:40,860 --> 00:54:43,522
I wash my hands
of any responsibility for you.

774
00:54:43,697 --> 00:54:45,289
All right.

775
00:54:46,533 --> 00:54:49,525
And, Miss Mars...

776
00:54:49,769 --> 00:54:53,261
...there's one thing that I must ask you
not to do around the theater.

777
00:54:53,440 --> 00:54:56,932
-What's that?
-Don't wear that hat.

778
00:54:58,411 --> 00:55:01,676
Well, Mr. Thornway, it's--

779
00:55:01,848 --> 00:55:03,816
It's the only one I've got.

780
00:55:04,918 --> 00:55:06,146
Yes, yes.

781
00:55:07,487 --> 00:55:08,852
Well, here we are. This is it.

782
00:55:09,022 --> 00:55:11,217
This is the "Incubator".

783
00:55:11,491 --> 00:55:14,289
A lot of fine young actresses
come out of here.

784
00:55:14,461 --> 00:55:17,259
Of course they have to go in first.

785
00:55:18,064 --> 00:55:19,656
Well, thanks again for the hat.

786
00:55:19,833 --> 00:55:22,097
You know it didn't have to be
a boughten.

787
00:55:22,268 --> 00:55:25,704
-A boughten? What's a boughten?
-Oh, that's what Poppy calls a store hat.

788
00:55:25,872 --> 00:55:29,808
You know, one you don't make yourself.
It's boughten. I always make my own.

789
00:55:29,976 --> 00:55:32,171
Yes, I know.

790
00:55:32,946 --> 00:55:35,915
-Good afternoon. Have you any rooms?
-No, sir.

791
00:55:36,082 --> 00:55:40,644
-Not even a small one?
-I'm sorry. We do not take mixed couples.

792
00:55:40,820 --> 00:55:42,981
We take only ladies.

793
00:55:43,156 --> 00:55:45,750
Well, will you take this one?

794
00:55:47,694 --> 00:55:49,423
-Yes, certainly.
-Well, that's fine.

795
00:55:49,596 --> 00:55:52,565
-I have to be getting on back to the theater.
-All right.

796
00:55:52,732 --> 00:55:54,290
Do you want me to come with you?

797
00:55:54,467 --> 00:55:57,561
No. No. You be at rehearsal tomorrow
morning at 9. Sharp.

798
00:55:57,737 --> 00:56:01,400
-Goodbye, Miss Mars.
-Goodbye. And thank you very much.

799
00:56:01,975 --> 00:56:05,638
Oh, Lily, for your brother.

800
00:56:05,812 --> 00:56:08,337
Oh, thank you, Mr. Tho--

801
00:56:09,983 --> 00:56:11,473
John.

802
00:56:12,619 --> 00:56:14,348
-Hi, Mike.
-Hello, Mr. Thornway.

803
00:56:14,521 --> 00:56:16,011
-What do you--
-I--

804
00:56:22,495 --> 00:56:24,656
-Rosebud?
-Yes, sir?

805
00:56:24,831 --> 00:56:28,892
-Is that Miss Rekay's?
-Yes, sir. She gave it to me.

806
00:56:29,069 --> 00:56:31,037
-Where is she?
-She's in her dressing room.

807
00:56:31,204 --> 00:56:34,264
Waiting for you. I'll tell her you here.

808
00:56:35,375 --> 00:56:38,708
-But, Isobel, it was written for you.
-I will not play it as it is.

809
00:56:38,878 --> 00:56:41,346
-But Isobel--
-He's here.

810
00:56:41,514 --> 00:56:44,677
Rosebud, I told you
to throw that hat away.

811
00:56:44,851 --> 00:56:46,944
-So you know more than I do?
-Who doesn't?

812
00:56:47,120 --> 00:56:50,089
-All right, then. Why don't you write a play?
-Why don't you?

813
00:56:50,256 --> 00:56:51,723
Now, what goes on here?

814
00:56:51,891 --> 00:56:54,587
Our star has decided
she doesn't like the third act.

815
00:56:54,761 --> 00:56:58,026
I hate it. It doesn't march along.
It dribbles.

816
00:56:58,198 --> 00:57:01,634
Now, let's sit down
and we'll talk about it. Quietly.

817
00:57:01,801 --> 00:57:04,133
Are you sure you have the time?

818
00:57:04,304 --> 00:57:07,273
Oh, I'm sorry I'm late, dear,
but I had to have lunch.

819
00:57:07,807 --> 00:57:09,434
What did you two eat, an elephant?

820
00:57:11,277 --> 00:57:14,713
And then after lunch I had things to do.

821
00:57:16,182 --> 00:57:17,843
Business.

822
00:57:21,488 --> 00:57:23,046
Hello?

823
00:57:23,289 --> 00:57:25,120
John. For you.

824
00:57:25,291 --> 00:57:26,952
A lady.

825
00:57:27,293 --> 00:57:29,659
-Me?
-Yes, you.

826
00:57:37,137 --> 00:57:38,661
Hello?

827
00:57:39,272 --> 00:57:42,730
Oh, hello, dear.
Well, it's nice to hear your voice.

828
00:57:42,909 --> 00:57:44,206
It's my mother.

829
00:57:45,011 --> 00:57:47,172
Yes, yes, she's here.

830
00:57:47,347 --> 00:57:53,411
No, I mean, she's not here.
She's here in the incubator.

831
00:57:53,586 --> 00:57:58,182
-Incubator?
-Yeah, it's a sort of a club.

832
00:57:58,358 --> 00:58:00,952
A young folks home.

833
00:58:01,594 --> 00:58:05,997
-John, will you give her a job?
-Well, I've already given her one.

834
00:58:06,766 --> 00:58:10,497
Hello. Tell her Mama
and the children send love.

835
00:58:10,870 --> 00:58:12,235
I'm Mama.

836
00:58:12,405 --> 00:58:14,999
Tell her I know I don't need to worry,
but I will.

837
00:58:15,808 --> 00:58:18,606
Well, you needn't, Mrs. Mars.

838
00:58:18,778 --> 00:58:22,714
I'll be just like a father to her.

839
00:58:22,882 --> 00:58:26,374
Oh, yes, yes, yes.
It's respectable. It's painfully respectable.

840
00:58:26,853 --> 00:58:28,411
Hold on.

841
00:58:28,721 --> 00:58:30,348
John, you will keep an eye on her?

842
00:58:30,523 --> 00:58:32,457
Oh, yes, yes, yes. Now, look dear...

843
00:58:32,625 --> 00:58:36,391
...I have to say goodbye now
because some people are waiting.

844
00:58:36,563 --> 00:58:37,791
Goodbye, dear.

845
00:58:40,233 --> 00:58:43,828
Well, after all
my father did bring her into the world.

846
00:58:44,003 --> 00:58:47,939
Now about that third act.
What seems to be wrong with it?

847
00:58:48,107 --> 00:58:50,735
Everything.
Brighter dialogue, stronger scenes.

848
00:58:50,910 --> 00:58:52,741
Such as?

849
00:58:53,446 --> 00:58:57,678
Such as you are going to write. Goodbye.

850
00:59:22,832 --> 00:59:24,231
Well?

851
00:59:24,467 --> 00:59:26,162
Well, what?

852
00:59:26,535 --> 00:59:29,333
You got any ideas about the third act?

853
00:59:29,505 --> 00:59:30,870
No. Have you?

854
00:59:31,240 --> 00:59:33,731
No. I was thinking about women too.

855
00:59:34,210 --> 00:59:36,075
What has Miss Mars
got to do with this?

856
00:59:37,046 --> 00:59:40,675
John, I wish I had as much money
as you don't know about women.

857
00:59:40,850 --> 00:59:44,877
Look, if you were sore at me. You'd punch
me right in the nose, wouldn't you?

858
00:59:45,054 --> 00:59:46,521
-With pleasure.
-Yeah. All right.

859
00:59:46,889 --> 00:59:48,880
If Isobel were squawking
about one scene...

860
00:59:49,058 --> 00:59:52,459
...I might think she was sincere, but no,
she doesn't like the whole act.

861
00:59:52,628 --> 00:59:55,620
"It doesn't march along. It dribbles."

862
00:59:55,798 --> 00:59:59,359
Yeah, and if you keep on being so chummy
with that babe from the woods--

863
00:59:59,535 --> 01:00:03,164
I am not chummy with Miss Mars.
Isobel's imagining things.

864
01:00:03,339 --> 01:00:06,331
John about such things,
women do not imagine, they know.

865
01:00:06,509 --> 01:00:09,444
I don't know how they know,
but they know.

866
01:00:11,280 --> 01:00:13,009
Catch that, will you?

867
01:00:16,218 --> 01:00:18,880
<i>-Hello?
-Miss Lily Mars is here to see Mr. Thornway.</i>

868
01:00:19,055 --> 01:00:21,819
-Shall I send her up?
-Why, yes.

869
01:00:21,991 --> 01:00:24,653
Yes, certainly. Right away.

870
01:00:28,564 --> 01:00:31,192
-It's-- It's your laundry.
-How could it be?

871
01:00:31,367 --> 01:00:33,699
-I didn't send out any laundry.
-You do your own?

872
01:00:33,869 --> 01:00:36,702
Oh, come on now.
Come on, let's get to work.

873
01:00:38,174 --> 01:00:42,668
Well, here's how it goes.
"Stefan enters." I'm Stefan.

874
01:00:42,845 --> 01:00:45,575
-"Nadina is singing." You're Nadina.
-Me?

875
01:00:45,748 --> 01:00:48,273
Now you can't go on with the gay song,
so you break.

876
01:00:48,451 --> 01:00:52,319
<i>Oh, I'm a Gypsy
I'm--</i>

877
01:00:52,488 --> 01:00:54,080
Come in, come in.

878
01:00:54,256 --> 01:00:55,723
"Who is she? Who is she? "

879
01:00:55,891 --> 01:00:58,416
"Please, believe me.
There is no other woman, darling."

880
01:01:00,129 --> 01:01:02,222
Just leave it in the hall out there.

881
01:01:03,599 --> 01:01:04,759
"You mustn't cry."

882
01:01:04,934 --> 01:01:07,459
"Why are you here?
Go away, leave me alone."

883
01:01:07,636 --> 01:01:09,627
-"No."
-"What do you want? "

884
01:01:10,106 --> 01:01:13,007
"First, I want to tell you
that you're beautiful.

885
01:01:13,542 --> 01:01:16,670
And then I want to take you in my arms."

886
01:01:16,846 --> 01:01:18,677
"Oh, Stefan."

887
01:01:18,848 --> 01:01:22,249
-All right, now stop your kidding, Owen.
-Who's kidding?

888
01:01:22,418 --> 01:01:25,251
"Oh, Stefan."

889
01:01:28,357 --> 01:01:31,326
Excuse me. Here's my laundry.

890
01:01:32,528 --> 01:01:35,554
-Good evening, Miss Mars.
-Good evening.

891
01:01:36,165 --> 01:01:37,655
-And good night.
-I wanted to--

892
01:01:37,833 --> 01:01:39,733
I'm terribly sorry, we're very busy...

893
01:01:39,902 --> 01:01:42,234
...it's time all young actresses
should be in bed.

894
01:01:42,404 --> 01:01:45,271
I was in bed, but I couldn't sleep.
I just tossed and tossed.

895
01:01:45,441 --> 01:01:47,272
Whenever I'm worried,
I toss and toss.

896
01:01:47,443 --> 01:01:49,934
Well, that's very interesting.
What's worrying you?

897
01:01:50,112 --> 01:01:52,205
-Our show.
-Now she doesn't like it.

898
01:01:52,381 --> 01:01:55,578
I like it. I love it.
I think it's a wonderful play. Really I do.

899
01:01:55,751 --> 01:01:58,948
-But may I say something?
-I know of no way of stopping you.

900
01:01:59,121 --> 01:02:01,919
Well, I think we need a new finish.

901
01:02:02,091 --> 01:02:05,356
Isobel doesn't like the third act,
Miss Mars doesn't like the finish.

902
01:02:05,528 --> 01:02:07,393
Tell me, Miss Mars,
what's wrong with it?

903
01:02:07,563 --> 01:02:10,555
-Well, to me it just fizzles out.
-Fizzles?

904
01:02:10,733 --> 01:02:12,701
-Just fizzles--
-Stop fizzling!

905
01:02:12,868 --> 01:02:15,496
Well, now listen. Here's the way it goes.

906
01:02:16,438 --> 01:02:18,599
Stefan says,
"l wanna take you in my arms."

907
01:02:18,774 --> 01:02:20,401
Nadina, "I want you to dearest.

908
01:02:20,576 --> 01:02:23,170
I've been away for years,
and I never wanna leave again."

909
01:02:23,345 --> 01:02:27,247
"As Nadina and Stefan gaze tenderly into
each other's eyes, curtain." Not natural.

910
01:02:28,150 --> 01:02:32,519
If I were in love and all they did was gaze
tenderly into my eyes I'd have another fight.

911
01:02:32,688 --> 01:02:37,148
-Well, Miss Mars, what would you do?
-Well, look, I'll show you.

912
01:02:37,726 --> 01:02:40,889
Now, you're Stefan.
Go on, say your line.

913
01:02:41,130 --> 01:02:44,293
And then I want to take you in my arms.

914
01:02:44,466 --> 01:02:46,297
And I want you to, dearest.

915
01:02:46,468 --> 01:02:49,494
I've been away from them
for a million years...

916
01:02:49,672 --> 01:02:52,140
...and I never wanna leave them again.

917
01:02:55,611 --> 01:02:57,135
Curtain.

918
01:02:58,247 --> 01:03:00,147
Here's where I think we really helped it.

919
01:03:00,316 --> 01:03:02,181
You follow the chambermaid
up the stairs.

920
01:03:02,351 --> 01:03:04,342
Say goodnight. You go into your room.

921
01:03:04,520 --> 01:03:07,045
She has her line. Curtain.

922
01:03:07,223 --> 01:03:09,088
-I love it.
-Yeah, that's great, John.

923
01:03:09,258 --> 01:03:11,522
-That takes care of all my objections.
-Fine.

924
01:03:11,694 --> 01:03:13,594
-Now let's try it, shall we?
-From where?

925
01:03:13,762 --> 01:03:16,925
The two of you are looking at each other
and the chambermaid enters.

926
01:03:17,099 --> 01:03:20,296
-Oh, yes.
-All right. Chambermaid.

927
01:03:31,480 --> 01:03:33,846
Your Excellencies,
your rooms are ready now.

928
01:03:34,016 --> 01:03:35,916
May I show you to them?

929
01:03:44,660 --> 01:03:47,220
Come on down and answer the phone.

930
01:03:47,396 --> 01:03:50,331
Lily, you're wanted on the telephone.

931
01:03:52,801 --> 01:03:55,031
Oh, it's Thorny again tonight?

932
01:03:55,204 --> 01:03:58,401
Oh, dear. Dear, dear.

933
01:03:59,942 --> 01:04:02,069
-Hello?
-I'm just leaving the apartment...

934
01:04:02,244 --> 01:04:04,508
...and I'll be right over
to pick you up. Goodbye.

935
01:04:05,214 --> 01:04:07,910
Goodbye!

936
01:04:14,857 --> 01:04:16,324
Yeah?

937
01:04:16,892 --> 01:04:20,453
She is? Well, tell her I've gone.
Tell her I've--

938
01:04:20,629 --> 01:04:22,597
She's already on her way up?

939
01:04:22,865 --> 01:04:26,357
Oh, that's bad. All right.
Well, thanks. Thanks.

940
01:04:50,426 --> 01:04:53,691
Hello, darling. Well, I was just taking
a cold shower to wake me up.

941
01:04:53,862 --> 01:04:57,354
You mustn't touch me.
You'll get all wet.

942
01:04:57,533 --> 01:05:00,559
-I've got to work all night.
-So you told me.

943
01:05:00,736 --> 01:05:03,398
But, John, take tonight off.
Let's go out somewhere.

944
01:05:03,572 --> 01:05:06,769
Now, angel, you mustn't tempt me.
Work is work.

945
01:05:06,942 --> 01:05:09,502
But you haven't taken me anywhere
in two whole weeks.

946
01:05:09,678 --> 01:05:13,546
Yes, I know, but tonight is not the night.

947
01:05:13,716 --> 01:05:17,675
No, I simply can't go out with you tonight.
That's all.

948
01:05:17,853 --> 01:05:19,411
Then I'll come in.

949
01:05:21,357 --> 01:05:24,793
Isobel, you must be worn out
from that rehearsal today, aren't you?

950
01:05:24,960 --> 01:05:26,655
-Oh, no.
-No?

951
01:05:26,829 --> 01:05:29,354
Just look at all this work I've got to do.

952
01:05:29,531 --> 01:05:30,793
Poor boy.

953
01:05:30,966 --> 01:05:32,194
Oh, don't touch anything.

954
01:05:32,368 --> 01:05:34,632
You'll get everything mixed up.

955
01:05:34,803 --> 01:05:38,136
-Remember the first time I sang for you?
-Yes, of course I do.

956
01:05:38,307 --> 01:05:40,639
That's one night I'll always remember.

957
01:05:40,809 --> 01:05:42,743
So shall I, John.

958
01:05:43,145 --> 01:05:46,979
-Look, Isobel, darling, I've just got to work.
-Wait, wait, wait.

959
01:05:50,886 --> 01:05:55,914
<i>When I look at you</i>

960
01:05:56,091 --> 01:06:00,858
<i>I hear lovely music</i>

961
01:06:01,029 --> 01:06:04,590
<i>Can</i>

962
01:06:06,969 --> 01:06:08,834
There is something wrong
with this piano.

963
01:06:09,004 --> 01:06:10,869
I'll fix it.

964
01:06:13,342 --> 01:06:21,306
<i>Can it be my heart that sings?</i>

965
01:06:23,652 --> 01:06:26,712
Well, good night now.
It's awful. It's terrible.

966
01:06:26,889 --> 01:06:29,221
-What?
-The piano, it needs tuning.

967
01:06:29,391 --> 01:06:32,087
Now, darling, you run home
and take a nice long rest.

968
01:06:32,261 --> 01:06:33,990
I certainly wish I could.

969
01:06:34,463 --> 01:06:39,298
If you won't change your mind,
so I better go home.

970
01:06:43,906 --> 01:06:47,535
Well, I'm sorry. But you know with the
show opening in a week and everything...

971
01:06:47,709 --> 01:06:51,110
...I'm so busy that I--
Well, you know how busy I am.

972
01:06:51,280 --> 01:06:53,612
Yes, I know.

973
01:06:55,684 --> 01:06:58,380
You're so busy...

974
01:06:58,554 --> 01:07:02,650
...you take your shower with your tie,
shirt, coat and pants on.

975
01:07:13,635 --> 01:07:18,265
<i>Think about a cowboy
When you think of yippee-yee</i>

976
01:07:18,440 --> 01:07:22,433
<i>Think of English crumpets
When you think of havin ' tea</i>

977
01:07:23,111 --> 01:07:26,740
<i>Think of silver moonlight
And how lovely it can be</i>

978
01:07:27,049 --> 01:07:32,180
<i>But when you think of lovin '
Baby, think of me</i>

979
01:07:32,354 --> 01:07:36,848
<i>Think of snowcapped mountains
When you think you'd like to ski</i>

980
01:07:37,025 --> 01:07:41,519
<i>Think of Cuba-libres
When you think you'd like a spree</i>

981
01:07:41,697 --> 01:07:45,531
<i>Think about the movies
For a set of dishes free</i>

982
01:07:45,701 --> 01:07:50,468
<i>But when you think of lovin '
Baby, think of me</i>

983
01:08:08,323 --> 01:08:10,484
Good evening, Mr. Thornway.
Table 53, please.

984
01:08:10,659 --> 01:08:13,150
-This way, please.
-Thank you.

985
01:08:37,352 --> 01:08:40,219
Ladies and gentlemen,
I see a celebrity among our customers.

986
01:08:40,389 --> 01:08:44,849
It's the ace of the racetrack,
the year's leading jockey, Dixie Bray.

987
01:08:50,566 --> 01:08:52,591
What are you gonna
do to entertain the folks?

988
01:08:52,768 --> 01:08:55,100
Nothing. All I can do is ride.

989
01:08:55,270 --> 01:08:57,830
Well, next time
I think you'd better bring your horse.

990
01:09:02,444 --> 01:09:05,504
Here's a man who has presented
many actors, so for a change...

991
01:09:05,681 --> 01:09:08,548
...I'm gonna present him,
John Thornway.

992
01:09:10,652 --> 01:09:12,017
-How are you, Bob?
-Fine, John.

993
01:09:12,187 --> 01:09:15,452
-Say, who's the lady I see you with?
-Oh, I'm Lily Mars.

994
01:09:15,624 --> 01:09:18,058
-Yeah? What do you do?
-I'm a chambermaid.

995
01:09:18,226 --> 01:09:20,626
-In what hotel?
-Not in any hotel.

996
01:09:20,796 --> 01:09:22,991
<i>In John Thornway's new show,
Let Me Dream.</i>

997
01:09:23,165 --> 01:09:26,032
What do you do in the show?
Do you make beds for the audience?

998
01:09:26,201 --> 01:09:31,366
Oh, I should say not. They're not gonna
fall asleep during our show.

999
01:09:32,574 --> 01:09:34,735
Well, what are you gonna do
to wake us up?

1000
01:09:34,910 --> 01:09:37,538
Well, I-- I can sing a little.

1001
01:09:37,713 --> 01:09:40,011
-Come on, sister, you're on.
-Is it all right?

1002
01:09:40,182 --> 01:09:41,809
Go right on.

1003
01:09:49,324 --> 01:09:52,885
Excuse me, I'll telephone John.
Maybe he'll come here and join us.

1004
01:09:53,061 --> 01:09:56,656
-But, darling, he's probably fast asleep.
-He'd better be.

1005
01:10:04,640 --> 01:10:09,134
<i>When I look at you</i>

1006
01:10:09,311 --> 01:10:13,145
<i>I hear lovely music</i>

1007
01:10:13,615 --> 01:10:19,315
<i>Can it be my heart that sings?</i>

1008
01:10:21,523 --> 01:10:25,584
<i>When I look at you</i>

1009
01:10:25,761 --> 01:10:29,822
<i>I look at an angel</i>

1010
01:10:29,998 --> 01:10:35,561
<i>Tell me where you've parked your wings</i>

1011
01:10:37,906 --> 01:10:41,774
<i>Dizzy me
Silly moon</i>

1012
01:10:41,943 --> 01:10:45,902
<i>Crazy quilt of a sky</i>

1013
01:10:46,081 --> 01:10:50,017
<i>Are you real or a dream</i>

1014
01:10:50,185 --> 01:10:53,882
<i>That got caught in my eye?</i>

1015
01:10:54,056 --> 01:10:57,719
<i>When I look at you</i>

1016
01:10:58,493 --> 01:11:02,088
<i>I'm looking at rainbows</i>

1017
01:11:02,531 --> 01:11:09,801
<i>Stars come tumbling down from above</i>

1018
01:11:09,971 --> 01:11:16,604
<i>And I'm in love with you</i>

1019
01:11:16,778 --> 01:11:24,014
<i>My love</i>

1020
01:11:30,592 --> 01:11:31,854
He doesn't answer.

1021
01:11:32,027 --> 01:11:34,154
Oh, well, John's a very sound sleeper.

1022
01:11:34,329 --> 01:11:36,763
We're going to another club.
New place, just opened.

1023
01:11:36,932 --> 01:11:38,422
Oh, no, I want to stay here.

1024
01:11:38,600 --> 01:11:41,535
But you won't like it here.
You won't like it at all.

1025
01:11:41,703 --> 01:11:43,694
You're not gonna be
a chambermaid very long.

1026
01:11:43,872 --> 01:11:46,306
-Let's try another and swing it a bit.
-All right.

1027
01:11:46,475 --> 01:11:48,375
Besides that, we can't get a table.

1028
01:11:48,543 --> 01:11:50,704
I can't get a table?

1029
01:11:52,714 --> 01:11:54,579
-You hear?
-Yes.

1030
01:11:54,750 --> 01:11:57,810
Well, if they want me to sing
for my supper. Come on.

1031
01:11:58,854 --> 01:12:01,982
<i>What is this throbbing within me?</i>

1032
01:12:05,594 --> 01:12:10,122
<i>What is this rhythm so new?</i>

1033
01:12:11,299 --> 01:12:13,665
<i>What is this beating
That keeps on repeating</i>

1034
01:12:13,835 --> 01:12:16,633
<i>And what am I dreaming
That I wake up screaming</i>

1035
01:12:16,805 --> 01:12:20,536
<i>I love you?</i>

1036
01:12:20,709 --> 01:12:24,270
<i>I love you</i>

1037
01:12:24,446 --> 01:12:31,682
<i>I love you</i>

1038
01:12:45,000 --> 01:12:52,998
<i>I love you</i>

1039
01:13:06,588 --> 01:13:08,681
John, I--

1040
01:13:10,592 --> 01:13:15,928
<i>When I look at you</i>

1041
01:13:16,097 --> 01:13:19,999
<i>I hear lovely music</i>

1042
01:13:20,168 --> 01:13:26,698
<i>Can it be my heart that sings?</i>

1043
01:13:32,747 --> 01:13:38,083
<i>When I look at you</i>

1044
01:13:38,253 --> 01:13:42,246
<i>I look at an angel</i>

1045
01:13:42,424 --> 01:13:50,229
<i>Tell me where you parked your wings</i>

1046
01:13:50,398 --> 01:13:52,764
<i>I mean, your wings</i>

1047
01:13:52,934 --> 01:13:55,767
<i>I mean, your wings</i>

1048
01:13:56,638 --> 01:13:59,436
<i>I mean, your ever-loving,
turtle-doving wings, Jack</i>

1049
01:14:00,008 --> 01:14:02,670
<i>Dizzy me</i>

1050
01:14:02,844 --> 01:14:05,574
<i>Silly moon</i>

1051
01:14:05,747 --> 01:14:12,482
<i>Crazy quilt
Of a lackadaisy, crazy quilt of a sky</i>

1052
01:14:12,654 --> 01:14:15,418
<i>Are you real as your seemin '</i>

1053
01:14:15,590 --> 01:14:17,649
<i>Or a dream that I'm dreamin '?</i>

1054
01:14:17,826 --> 01:14:21,557
<i>Or are you just a sty
That got caught in my eye?</i>

1055
01:14:21,730 --> 01:14:23,561
<i>Just a sty in my eye</i>

1056
01:14:23,732 --> 01:14:26,257
<i>When I look at you</i>

1057
01:14:26,935 --> 01:14:29,597
<i>I see a rainbow</i>

1058
01:14:29,771 --> 01:14:32,399
<i>The sun, the moon
The stars in June</i>

1059
01:14:32,574 --> 01:14:35,168
<i>Come tumbling down from above</i>

1060
01:14:35,343 --> 01:14:36,970
<i>And I might as well face it</i>

1061
01:14:37,145 --> 01:14:44,950
<i>I'm in love!</i>

1062
01:15:08,977 --> 01:15:11,537
Was I all right? Did you--?

1063
01:15:14,215 --> 01:15:16,080
Miss Rekay.

1064
01:15:16,251 --> 01:15:18,617
I'm sorry, but, but--

1065
01:15:18,787 --> 01:15:20,516
-But--
-But, but what?

1066
01:15:20,689 --> 01:15:23,385
-I didn't know you were here.
-Well, I wasn't.

1067
01:15:23,558 --> 01:15:27,187
But as luck would have it I happened
to drop in just in time to catch your act.

1068
01:15:27,362 --> 01:15:29,922
Clever, very clever. Isn't she, John?

1069
01:15:31,967 --> 01:15:34,959
Well, there I was
and he said do something.

1070
01:15:35,136 --> 01:15:38,105
-I didn't know what to do.
-So you imitated me.

1071
01:15:38,273 --> 01:15:41,504
Well, Miss Rekay, any time you want to,
you can imitate me.

1072
01:15:41,676 --> 01:15:44,668
Oh, thank you.
That's very kind of you, Miss Mars.

1073
01:15:45,113 --> 01:15:48,014
And I'll never sing your song again,
I promise. Honest.

1074
01:15:48,183 --> 01:15:51,050
Neither shall I. Honest.

1075
01:15:52,020 --> 01:15:56,252
Isobel, do you care
for a drink or anything?

1076
01:15:56,958 --> 01:16:00,121
No, I don't care for a drink or anything.

1077
01:16:00,295 --> 01:16:01,887
I'm sorry to break up this party.

1078
01:16:03,331 --> 01:16:05,891
But I'm getting tired, John, very tired.

1079
01:16:06,067 --> 01:16:09,127
I think I'd better be taken home
right now.

1080
01:16:11,940 --> 01:16:15,671
-Come on, Owen.
-Isobel, I've called a rehearsal...

1081
01:16:15,844 --> 01:16:19,245
...for 9 in the morning.
You come in whenever you like.

1082
01:16:19,414 --> 01:16:22,815
I'll do that, John. Good night.

1083
01:16:25,153 --> 01:16:30,386
Oh, now look what I've done.
She's mad, John, good and mad.

1084
01:16:31,659 --> 01:16:33,957
Come on, let's dance.

1085
01:16:51,246 --> 01:16:55,979
-It's exactly 5:00 p.m.
-All right, so what, time signal?

1086
01:16:56,151 --> 01:16:59,314
All this waiting, waiting, waiting.
And for what?

1087
01:16:59,487 --> 01:17:02,354
For a woman to make up her mind.

1088
01:17:02,524 --> 01:17:04,685
From me they get 10 minutes, tops.

1089
01:17:04,859 --> 01:17:07,384
Stop your worrying.
Rekay'll be back.

1090
01:17:07,562 --> 01:17:10,030
She's always getting
hoity-toity and flouncing out.

1091
01:17:10,198 --> 01:17:11,722
But this time she means it.

1092
01:17:11,900 --> 01:17:14,300
It'll take a little high-powered
coaxing and petting.

1093
01:17:14,469 --> 01:17:18,303
-John knows how to handle her.
-Hope he hasn't lost his touch.

1094
01:17:21,309 --> 01:17:24,210
All right, Scotty, you can tell them
they can all go home.

1095
01:17:25,547 --> 01:17:28,038
Everybody.
Everybody, that's all for today.

1096
01:17:28,483 --> 01:17:29,541
What time tomorrow?

1097
01:17:32,420 --> 01:17:35,321
I'll let you know tomorrow, that's all.

1098
01:17:35,924 --> 01:17:38,358
Is there anything I can do, John?

1099
01:17:38,927 --> 01:17:42,863
Yeah, Scotty, you can go out
and get drunk. For me.

1100
01:17:43,031 --> 01:17:44,623
Anything I can do, John?

1101
01:17:44,799 --> 01:17:46,096
Well, you can help Scotty.

1102
01:17:46,267 --> 01:17:48,861
-Anything I can do?
-Hey.

1103
01:17:49,037 --> 01:17:51,164
Yeah, you help the two of them.

1104
01:17:51,339 --> 01:17:53,000
That'll be all for today.

1105
01:17:58,780 --> 01:18:00,270
John?

1106
01:18:02,584 --> 01:18:04,176
Hi there.

1107
01:18:04,419 --> 01:18:05,909
Hello.

1108
01:18:08,356 --> 01:18:10,256
I'm going home.

1109
01:18:10,959 --> 01:18:13,621
Back home. Tonight.

1110
01:18:14,662 --> 01:18:17,961
No. No, you're not.

1111
01:18:18,133 --> 01:18:23,036
But if I go away everything will be all right
with the show...

1112
01:18:24,372 --> 01:18:25,862
...and everything.

1113
01:18:26,040 --> 01:18:28,440
I'm calling off the show.

1114
01:18:28,610 --> 01:18:30,373
Oh, no, you mustn't.

1115
01:18:30,545 --> 01:18:33,708
I'm not gonna do it
unless I can do it right.

1116
01:18:36,651 --> 01:18:42,715
But, John, I've been thinking
that maybe I--

1117
01:18:46,294 --> 01:18:48,888
I know what you've been thinking.

1118
01:18:51,032 --> 01:18:54,331
I believe I could do it.

1119
01:18:54,903 --> 01:18:55,892
What do you think?

1120
01:18:58,373 --> 01:19:00,705
I think that...

1121
01:19:01,943 --> 01:19:03,137
...I'm in love with you.

1122
01:19:14,756 --> 01:19:16,986
Oh, John, I--

1123
01:19:17,158 --> 01:19:19,718
You run along now...

1124
01:19:19,894 --> 01:19:23,660
...and I'll let you know what I'm gonna
do just as soon as I know myself.

1125
01:19:29,037 --> 01:19:30,732
All right.

1126
01:19:41,683 --> 01:19:43,048
Love.

1127
01:19:43,785 --> 01:19:45,878
I hate love.

1128
01:19:46,054 --> 01:19:48,318
Women? You can have them.

1129
01:19:48,489 --> 01:19:49,888
Thanks, I got some.

1130
01:19:51,926 --> 01:19:54,986
Good night, fellow comedians.
I'm going home to my wife...

1131
01:19:55,163 --> 01:19:56,824
...the one in Brooklyn.

1132
01:19:56,998 --> 01:20:03,130
I shall walk all the way, and I hope,
I hope it's raining.

1133
01:20:03,304 --> 01:20:08,003
And when I'll get home,
if my supper isn't ready, I shall beat her.

1134
01:20:08,176 --> 01:20:12,806
And if my supper is ready,
I shall not eat it.

1135
01:20:13,281 --> 01:20:14,976
Farewell.

1136
01:20:16,117 --> 01:20:20,076
There's a guy that gets drunk and
has the D.T.'s all at the same time.

1137
01:20:22,790 --> 01:20:24,223
Well?

1138
01:20:24,592 --> 01:20:27,288
The show opens as planned,
one week from tonight.

1139
01:20:27,462 --> 01:20:29,157
-With Rekay?
-Without Rekay.

1140
01:20:29,330 --> 01:20:30,991
Right. Now here's what I'm gonna do.

1141
01:20:31,165 --> 01:20:34,692
Don't. She's clever but she's not
nearly ready to step into a big part.

1142
01:20:34,869 --> 01:20:37,702
It'll take years before
she's ready to carry a Broadway show.

1143
01:20:38,406 --> 01:20:40,499
Just the same,
I'm gonna take a chance.

1144
01:20:40,675 --> 01:20:42,802
Wait. We're the ones
that have been drinking.

1145
01:20:42,977 --> 01:20:45,445
Think it over, John.
It's an awful big gamble.

1146
01:20:45,613 --> 01:20:47,843
What's show business?

1147
01:20:48,016 --> 01:20:51,452
Lily. Lily, telephone. Lily, telephone.

1148
01:20:51,619 --> 01:20:53,052
It's Thorny.

1149
01:20:56,624 --> 01:20:58,251
Hello?

1150
01:20:58,459 --> 01:21:00,222
Yes, John.

1151
01:21:01,663 --> 01:21:03,392
Yes, John.

1152
01:21:05,266 --> 01:21:07,166
Oh, yes, John.

1153
01:21:09,837 --> 01:21:11,532
What's happened?

1154
01:21:18,880 --> 01:21:21,041
-Where are you going?
-Hey, Lily, wait.

1155
01:21:21,215 --> 01:21:23,183
-Where you going?
-To the theater.

1156
01:21:23,351 --> 01:21:25,410
-Like that?
-What?

1157
01:21:25,620 --> 01:21:29,078
-Mama! Mama!
-What is it? What happened?

1158
01:21:29,257 --> 01:21:32,420
Hello, operator, get me long distance.
Yes.

1159
01:21:32,593 --> 01:21:38,054
Oh, Lily.
Oh, I'm so tickled that I'm tickled.

1160
01:21:38,232 --> 01:21:43,499
Oh, bless your heart child. Well, it's
only what I expected sooner or later.

1161
01:21:43,671 --> 01:21:48,904
Good night, dear. Lily, be sure to eat plenty
of fresh vegetables. Goodbye.

1162
01:21:49,310 --> 01:21:52,507
<i>Hello, operator?
Get me the Midhaven Daily Press.</i>

1163
01:21:52,680 --> 01:21:55,376
Children, guess what? Lily is a star.

1164
01:21:55,683 --> 01:21:59,084
-Will she twinkle?
-She'll twinkle.

1165
01:21:59,253 --> 01:22:02,745
<i>Midhaven Daily Press? I have a very
important piece of news for you.</i>

Tell him about it, Mama!
Tell him about Lily!

1167
01:22:06,227 --> 01:22:09,719
Children, stop it. Be quiet. Be quiet.

1168
01:22:09,897 --> 01:22:11,159
Not you.

1169
01:22:11,332 --> 01:22:14,165
My name is Lily Mars' mother.
Guess what?

1170
01:22:14,335 --> 01:22:18,169
A little more wine?

1171
01:22:18,606 --> 01:22:21,871
"No more champagne, Stefan.

1172
01:22:22,143 --> 01:22:24,304
More kisses."

1173
01:22:26,447 --> 01:22:27,778
-No.
-No?

1174
01:22:27,949 --> 01:22:29,746
No, Lily. No.

1175
01:22:29,917 --> 01:22:34,752
Look, darling, try to remember
you're a mature Russian princess.

1176
01:22:35,323 --> 01:22:36,915
-On your honeymoon.
-Yes.

1177
01:22:37,091 --> 01:22:41,960
Not a village belle on a hayride.

1178
01:22:42,130 --> 01:22:45,497
That's all right, darling.
Come on now. Let's try it again.

1179
01:22:45,666 --> 01:22:47,463
-All right.
-From your entrance.

1180
01:22:49,337 --> 01:22:51,134
You're doing fine, honey. Keep it up.

1181
01:22:51,305 --> 01:22:54,399
Don't get excited. Don't get excited now.

1182
01:23:00,381 --> 01:23:02,815
-All right.
-All right.

1183
01:23:03,651 --> 01:23:08,247
Oh, Stefan, how could you do this to me,
and on our honeymoon?

1184
01:23:08,423 --> 01:23:11,017
No, no, no. You're not suffering enough.

1185
01:23:11,192 --> 01:23:13,387
-She's wiggling enough.
-Go on, go on. Suffer.

1186
01:23:13,561 --> 01:23:18,055
Suffer. Oh, Stefan,
how could you do this to-- Ouch!

1187
01:23:18,232 --> 01:23:20,257
And on our honeymoon.

1188
01:23:20,435 --> 01:23:23,598
-Now, darling, you know what I want.
-Yes.

1189
01:23:23,771 --> 01:23:24,999
-You're sure?
-Yes.

1190
01:23:25,173 --> 01:23:26,902
That's fine.

1191
01:23:27,074 --> 01:23:29,474

-Will you send this out for me, Mike?
-Sure will, Syd.

1198
01:23:55,770 --> 01:23:58,102
Say, how'd it go?

1199
01:23:58,272 --> 01:24:01,605
Well, it's a good sign
when the dress rehearsal smells.

1200
01:24:01,843 --> 01:24:03,674
How was the Mars kid?

1201

It's a good sign

Attababy, baby.

-I was all right, wasn't I?
-Oh, sure. Sure you were.

1204
01:24:16,290 --> 01:24:19,487
And you're gonna be all righter too.
Now relax, huh?

1205
01:24:19,660 --> 01:24:21,025
All right.

With a little luck and a lot of hard work,
you're gonna be a great actress, someday.

1228
01:25:59,026 --> 01:26:01,688
Now, I've called another
dress rehearsal for tonight.

1229
01:26:01,862 --> 01:26:06,060
We'll start just as soon as the cast has
had a little rest and got something to eat.

1230
01:26:09,770 --> 01:26:12,796
All right, boss. I'm ready.

1231
01:26:14,909 --> 01:26:16,570
No, Lily.

1232
01:26:17,011 --> 01:26:21,607
I hate worse than anything in the world
to tell you, but no, you're not ready.

1233
01:26:23,184 --> 01:26:27,484
I should have had more sense than
to let you tackle such a tough part...

1234
01:26:27,655 --> 01:26:31,056
...but I wasn't being sensible
and now I've got to be.

1235
01:26:31,392 --> 01:26:33,121
And so have you.

1236
01:26:38,232 --> 01:26:40,200
Am I hopeless?

1237
01:26:40,434 --> 01:26:43,562
No, darling, no, you're not hopeless.

1238
01:26:43,738 --> 01:26:49,199
It's just that you're green.
You're inexperienced.

1239
01:26:49,443 --> 01:26:53,504
Lily, it's a tremendous job for an actress
to carry a whole show.

1240
01:26:53,681 --> 01:26:58,277
She has to have authority.
She has to have range and ease.

1241
01:26:58,452 --> 01:27:02,513
And a thousand and one tricks of the trade
that you can only learn through experience.

1242
01:27:02,690 --> 01:27:07,093
She has to be a finished actress.
A big actress.

1243
01:27:11,432 --> 01:27:13,662
And I'm only a little one.

1244
01:27:14,168 --> 01:27:17,569
You're a good little one.

1245
01:27:17,838 --> 01:27:21,001
But this part calls for a good big one.

1246
01:27:21,208 --> 01:27:22,800
And I've got her.

1247
01:27:24,545 --> 01:27:26,740
You made up with Isobel.

1248
01:27:26,914 --> 01:27:30,179
It wasn't a question of making up,
it was business.

1249
01:27:30,351 --> 01:27:33,946
Show business between
two professional show people...

1250
01:27:34,121 --> 01:27:39,525
...who understand that their job's are more
important than their personal feelings.

1251
01:27:39,994 --> 01:27:41,791
Darling you and--

1252
01:27:44,331 --> 01:27:48,825
-Miss Rekay wants me to put these--
-Just a minute, please.

1253
01:27:49,670 --> 01:27:52,332
She can move in now.

1254
01:27:56,911 --> 01:27:58,640
Lily, take all the time you want to.

1255
01:27:58,813 --> 01:28:01,941
She shouldn't have
barged in here like that.

1256
01:28:04,418 --> 01:28:06,079
Darling, I--

1257
01:28:06,554 --> 01:28:11,491
I can't tell you
how rotten I feel about that but--

1258
01:28:11,826 --> 01:28:15,956
-Hey, boss.
-I'll be with you in just a minute, Scotty.

1259
01:28:16,497 --> 01:28:18,863
But here's how it's got to be:

1260
01:28:19,366 --> 01:28:22,927
Isobel plays the princess
and you play the--

1261
01:28:24,004 --> 01:28:25,904
Your old part.

1262
01:28:33,214 --> 01:28:37,651
Rekay called. She wants this room
or she's gonna take another powder on you.

1263
01:28:37,818 --> 01:28:40,218
Well, she'll just have to wait.

1264
01:28:47,061 --> 01:28:48,255
Lily.

1265
01:28:48,429 --> 01:28:49,794
Lily.

1266
01:28:50,831 --> 01:28:53,857
I don't want you to go
but you can if you want to.

1267
01:28:54,268 --> 01:28:58,261
You can go away, you can go back home,
you can hate me for the rest of your life.

1268
01:28:59,273 --> 01:29:01,867
But there's something else you can do
if you want to.

1269
01:29:02,643 --> 01:29:04,235
You can come back tomorrow night...

1270
01:29:04,411 --> 01:29:08,939
...and try to play that maid better than any
maid has ever been played in any theater.

1271
01:29:09,450 --> 01:29:11,918
When you walk out on stage
and say your few lines...

1272
01:29:12,086 --> 01:29:14,850
...and give them everything
you've got to give...

1273
01:29:15,055 --> 01:29:18,024
...there'll be one less amateur
in the world...

1274
01:29:18,192 --> 01:29:20,717
...and one more professional.

1275
01:29:21,729 --> 01:29:23,822
Now, that's all up to you.

1276
01:29:47,888 --> 01:29:50,083
Here she is.

1277
01:29:52,359 --> 01:29:53,724
Surprise! Surprise!

1278
01:29:53,894 --> 01:29:55,691
Surprise! Surprise!

1279
01:29:55,863 --> 01:29:57,797
-Congratulations.
-Congratulations, Lily.

1280
01:29:57,965 --> 01:30:00,195
-I'm so happy.
-We'll all move to New York.

1281
01:30:00,367 --> 01:30:03,768
-I'll get a lot of superduper doorknobs.
-Wonderful. You're wonderful.

1282
01:30:03,938 --> 01:30:06,202
-We just had to come.
-So we came.

1283
01:30:06,373 --> 01:30:08,603
-In a bus.
-We sold the piano.

1284
01:30:08,776 --> 01:30:12,007
Oh, well, I'm certainly glad to see you.

1285
01:30:12,179 --> 01:30:13,771
Oh, you're tired, dear.

1286
01:30:13,948 --> 01:30:17,816
Come and sit over here.
Right here in this big chair.

1287
01:30:17,985 --> 01:30:19,475
You look just the same.

1288
01:30:19,653 --> 01:30:23,089
-Well, where's Poppy?
-Poppy?

1289
01:30:23,257 --> 01:30:24,781
Oh, Poppy.

1290
01:30:24,959 --> 01:30:27,484
Children, did we come
away without Poppy?

1291
01:30:27,661 --> 01:30:29,060
No, Mama.

1292
01:30:29,230 --> 01:30:32,028
-Did we leave her on the bus?
-No, Mama.

1293
01:30:32,199 --> 01:30:33,962
Well, then, she must be here.

1294
01:30:34,134 --> 01:30:38,764
Yes, Mama. Poppy! Poppy! Poppy!

1295
01:30:49,817 --> 01:30:52,217
<i>Congratulations, Lily, dear</i>

1296
01:30:52,386 --> 01:30:54,946
<i>Upon the start of your career</i>

1297
01:30:55,122 --> 01:30:58,421
<i>We love you best of all the stars</i>

1298
01:30:58,592 --> 01:31:02,323
<i>We're proud of you, Miss Lily Mars</i>

1299
01:31:03,964 --> 01:31:06,159
That's nice, dear. She loved it.

1300
01:31:09,637 --> 01:31:14,370
I ' m not a star. I ' m not even an actress.

1301
01:31:14,775 --> 01:31:17,471
I'm nothing at all.

1302
01:31:17,912 --> 01:31:19,436
Oh, there, there, dear.

1303
01:31:20,014 --> 01:31:24,041
Now no matter how bad it is,
it isn't as bad as all that.

1304
01:31:24,551 --> 01:31:27,418
I wanna go home.

1305
01:31:27,588 --> 01:31:30,284
Oh, there, there, darling.

1306
01:31:59,019 --> 01:32:02,853
Look at him. He's got the biggest
moneymaker he ever had in his life.

1307
01:32:03,023 --> 01:32:04,354
And what is he doing? Moping.

1308
01:32:28,749 --> 01:32:32,116
-John, how about Lily? Is she here?
-I don't know.

1309
01:32:32,286 --> 01:32:34,311
What about her part?

1310
01:32:34,488 --> 01:32:37,480
Well, if she isn't here to play it,
the other girl will.

1311
01:33:20,434 --> 01:33:26,737
<i>I heard a tune in the moonlight</i>

1312
01:33:26,907 --> 01:33:31,276
<i>From the distance arising</i>

1313
01:33:31,645 --> 01:33:36,412
<i>Troika bells harmonizing</i>

1314
01:33:36,583 --> 01:33:41,646
<i>A Russian rhapsody</i>

1315
01:33:41,822 --> 01:33:46,259
<i>Where roses bloom in September</i>

1316
01:33:46,894 --> 01:33:54,824
<i>Where autumn leaves are swaying</i>

1317
01:33:55,002 --> 01:34:01,100
<i>To balalaikas playing</i>

1318
01:34:02,009 --> 01:34:05,206
John, how soon is Lily
supposed to make her entrance?

1319
01:34:05,646 --> 01:34:07,637
Right after Isobel's song.

1320
01:34:07,815 --> 01:34:09,339
Where?

1321
01:34:09,850 --> 01:34:11,579
Through that door over there.

1322
01:34:13,620 --> 01:34:18,523
<i>Pick a rose in September</i>

1323
01:34:18,692 --> 01:34:25,723
<i>When it's spring you'll remember</i>

1324
01:34:25,899 --> 01:34:30,962
<i>A Russian rhapsody</i>

1325
01:34:31,138 --> 01:34:36,599
<i>When it's spring you'll remember</i>

1326
01:34:36,777 --> 01:34:44,309
<i>A Russian rhapsody</i>

1327
01:34:52,226 --> 01:34:53,989
-Stefan.
-Waiters.

1328
01:34:57,865 --> 01:35:01,824
No more champagne, Stefan.
More kisses.

1329
01:35:17,151 --> 01:35:21,554
Your excellencies, your room is ready.
May I show you to it now?

1330
01:35:22,022 --> 01:35:23,887
Children, quiet. Quiet.

1331
01:35:27,127 --> 01:35:29,357
-Good night, Your Excellencies.
-Good night.

1332
01:35:29,530 --> 01:35:31,259
And may your dreams be beautiful.

1333
01:35:31,431 --> 01:35:33,194
-Thank you.
-Thank you.

1334
01:35:43,443 --> 01:35:46,810
-I'm so glad, dear.
-I knew she'd come back. I'll see you later.

1335
01:35:49,016 --> 01:35:51,348
Isobel, darling, you were swell.

1336
01:35:51,518 --> 01:35:54,817
Thanks for coming back
and I'm very happy about everything.

1337
01:35:54,988 --> 01:35:56,922
You should be, John. I am too.

1338
01:35:57,090 --> 01:36:00,685
Now run along and see Lily.
And tell her for me she's a real trouper.

1339
01:36:00,861 --> 01:36:02,226
And you're very lucky.

1340
01:36:02,396 --> 01:36:08,824
Swell, kid. You were swell. You were swell.
Oh, and you were swell. Swell.

1341
01:36:09,369 --> 01:36:10,927
Hello.

1342
01:36:11,371 --> 01:36:13,669
Swell. You were sw--

1343
01:36:13,840 --> 01:36:16,331
Oh, Scotty, listen, thanks a million.
It was swell.

1344
01:36:16,510 --> 01:36:19,809
Leo, costumes swell, swell.
You were swell.

1345
01:36:19,980 --> 01:36:22,608
You-- Oh, I beg your pardon.
I thought he was in the--

1346
01:36:22,783 --> 01:36:25,980
-This should be good for two years.
-Yes. Listen, where is Lily dress--

1347
01:36:26,153 --> 01:36:27,848
Lily's dressing--

1348
01:36:28,222 --> 01:36:30,782
Oh, it's all right. Never mind.
You were swell, Scotty.

1349
01:36:32,559 --> 01:36:35,619
-She just left.
-Oh, well, thanks. You were swell, Prissy.

1350
01:36:35,796 --> 01:36:38,026
Thank you.

1351
01:36:40,767 --> 01:36:43,497
Lily. Lily.

1352
01:36:45,939 --> 01:36:48,032
-Hi there.
-Hello.

1353
01:36:48,208 --> 01:36:49,334
Thanks for coming back.

1354
01:36:49,509 --> 01:36:53,070
I never enjoyed any actress's performance
so much in my life.

1355
01:36:53,247 --> 01:36:55,408
Oh, John, I was only on the stage
for a minute.

1356
01:36:55,582 --> 01:36:58,073
It was the happiest,
the most thrilling moment...

1357
01:36:58,252 --> 01:37:00,743
...I ever hope to have in the theater.

1358
01:37:00,921 --> 01:37:04,152
It made me sure
that I was right about you.

1359
01:37:10,397 --> 01:37:11,955
John, we've got an audience.

1360
01:37:12,132 --> 01:37:15,624
Well, you just wait until you see
the audiences you're going to have.

1361
01:37:15,802 --> 01:37:20,603
<i>You've heard of Sarah Bernhardt
She really was a dilly</i>

1362
01:37:20,774 --> 01:37:25,507
<i>But Sarah Bernhardt couldn't compare
To the gal that's known as Lily</i>

1363
01:37:33,854 --> 01:37:38,553
<i>Where there's music</i>

1364
01:37:38,725 --> 01:37:42,286
<i>There'll be singing</i>

1365
01:37:42,462 --> 01:37:49,698
<i>Where there's singing
You'll find skies of blue</i>

1366
01:37:49,870 --> 01:37:53,931
<i>For when all the world goes wrong</i>

1367
01:37:54,107 --> 01:37:57,543
<i>A simple little song</i>

1368
01:37:57,711 --> 01:38:05,675
<i>Will always bring a rainbow
Smiling through</i>

1369
01:38:06,687 --> 01:38:10,714
<i>With a rainbow</i>

1370
01:38:10,891 --> 01:38:14,691
<i>There'll be laughter</i>

1371
01:38:14,861 --> 01:38:22,563
<i>Chasing after sunshine from above</i>

1372
01:38:22,736 --> 01:38:26,797
<i>Where there's sunshine</i>

1373
01:38:26,973 --> 01:38:30,739
<i>There'll be music</i>

1374
01:38:30,911 --> 01:38:36,781
<i>And where there's music</i>

1375
01:38:36,950 --> 01:38:44,083
<i>There's love</i>

1376
01:38:45,492 --> 01:38:48,723
Hey, mister, that's my sister.

1377
01:38:49,396 --> 01:38:50,693
She's marriaged.

1378
01:38:52,265 --> 01:38:54,665
-Poppy, be quiet.
-Yes, Poppy, you'd better...

1379
01:38:54,835 --> 01:38:56,735
...or you'll get put out.

1380
01:38:57,204 --> 01:38:59,604
Not with my mother-in-law here.

1381
01:38:59,773 --> 01:39:03,607
<i>For songs are souvenirs</i>

1382
01:39:03,777 --> 01:39:08,578
<i>That live through the years</i>

1383
01:39:08,749 --> 01:39:17,282
<i>The grand old songs never die</i>

1384
01:39:19,025 --> 01:39:21,050
<i>Where there's music</i>

1385
01:39:21,528 --> 01:39:24,725
<i>There'll be dancing</i>

1386
01:39:24,898 --> 01:39:33,067
<i>No matter where you go</i>

1387
01:39:43,016 --> 01:39:47,419
<i>It's 3:00 in the morning</i>

1388
01:39:47,587 --> 01:39:51,683
<i>We've danced the whole night through</i>

1389
01:39:51,858 --> 01:39:56,386
<i>That melody, so entrancing</i>

1390
01:39:56,563 --> 01:40:00,863
<i>Seems to be made for us two</i>

1391
01:40:01,034 --> 01:40:04,299
<i>I could just keep right on dancing</i>

1392
01:40:04,471 --> 01:40:08,669
<i>Forever dear with you</i>

1393
01:40:32,599 --> 01:40:34,089
<i>Where there's music</i>

1394
01:40:34,267 --> 01:40:35,928
<i>There'll be dancing</i>

1395
01:40:36,102 --> 01:40:37,797
<i>And romancing</i>

1396
01:40:37,971 --> 01:40:43,705
<i>To the rhythm that is new</i>

1397
01:40:46,613 --> 01:40:49,207
<i>Gotta dance</i>

1398
01:40:50,150 --> 01:40:52,778
<i>Gotta dance</i>

1399
01:41:04,831 --> 01:41:07,595
<i>Broadway rhythm
It's got me</i>

1400
01:41:07,767 --> 01:41:11,931
<i>Everybody dance</i>

1401
01:41:12,105 --> 01:41:15,006
<i>Broadway rhythm
It's got me</i>

1402
01:41:15,175 --> 01:41:18,667
<i>-Everybody dance
-Broadway rhythm it's got me</i>

1403
01:41:18,845 --> 01:41:20,312
<i>On the gay white way</i>

1404
01:41:20,480 --> 01:41:23,643
<i>-In each merry caf
-Orchestras play</i>

1405
01:41:23,817 --> 01:41:29,778
<i>-Taking your breath away with that
-Broadway rhythm it's got me</i>

1406
01:41:29,956 --> 01:41:37,829
<i>Everybody sing and dance</i>

1407
01:41:40,734 --> 01:41:45,103
<i>That Broadway rhythm</i>

1408
01:41:48,008 --> 01:41:51,944
<i>That Broadway rhythm</i>

1409
01:41:52,112 --> 01:41:55,912
<i>When I hear that happy beat</i>

1410
01:41:56,082 --> 01:42:00,143
<i>Feel like dancing down the street</i>

1411
01:42:02,722 --> 01:42:07,716
<i>That Broadway rhythm
It's got me beating</i>

1412
01:42:41,962 --> 01:42:46,331
<i>Broadway rhythm
It's got me</i>

1413
01:42:49,269 --> 01:42:53,638
<i>Broadway rhythm
It's got me</i>

1414
01:42:56,176 --> 01:43:02,604
<i>It's the sweetest beat
From the sweetest street</i>

1415
01:43:02,782 --> 01:43:07,481
<i>-Known as Broadway
-The street of a million dreams</i>

1416
01:43:07,654 --> 01:43:11,146
<i>-Broadway
-Where nothing is what it seems</i>

1417
01:43:11,324 --> 01:43:13,815
<i>Broadway rhythm's got me</i>

1418
01:43:13,994 --> 01:43:16,258
<i>And where there's rhythm</i>

1419
01:43:16,429 --> 01:43:23,494
<i>There's music and love</i>
