1
00:00:11,011 --> 00:00:14,014


2
00:00:34,034 --> 00:00:36,036
oo! oo! oo! br-r-r-r-rr!

3
00:00:36,536 --> 00:00:37,537
oo! oo! oo! br-r-r-r-rr!

4
00:00:38,038 --> 00:00:39,539
oo! oo!

5
00:00:41,541 --> 00:00:42,542
oo! wa!

6
00:00:43,043 --> 00:00:44,044
oo! wa!

7
00:00:44,544 --> 00:00:45,545
oo! wa!

8
00:00:46,046 --> 00:00:47,547
woooo! woooo!

9
00:00:48,048 --> 00:00:50,550
woooo! hoo hoo!
woooo!

10
00:00:51,551 --> 00:00:53,553
oo oo! oo hoo!

11
00:00:54,054 --> 00:00:55,055
br-r-r-r-rr! eeoo!

12
00:00:55,555 --> 00:00:56,556
caw! caw!

13
00:00:57,057 --> 00:00:59,059
caw! caw! caw! caw!

14
00:00:59,059 --> 00:01:01,061
caw! caw! caw!

15
00:01:21,581 --> 00:01:24,084
man: this is where
the town begins.

16
00:01:24,584 --> 00:01:27,087
this part of the country's been
through a lot of changes.

17
00:01:27,087 --> 00:01:28,588
not all small ones, either.

18
00:01:29,089 --> 00:01:32,592
i think they're in the process
of going through another one.

19
00:01:32,592 --> 00:01:35,095
you know, there's bound to be
at least one person

20
00:01:35,095 --> 00:01:37,597
who remembers when everything
was just open land,

21
00:01:37,597 --> 00:01:39,599
like it is right here,

22
00:01:39,599 --> 00:01:42,602
and some people can just look
at the land--just look at it--

23
00:01:42,602 --> 00:01:44,554
and tell you
what happened there.

24
00:01:44,854 --> 00:01:47,357
this whole area was once
under water--

25
00:01:47,357 --> 00:01:48,858
almost still looks like it.

26
00:01:49,359 --> 00:01:51,361
after that,
there was a period

27
00:01:51,361 --> 00:01:53,863
when dinosaurs roamed
all over the place.

28
00:01:53,863 --> 00:01:56,366
i used to be fascinated by
dinosaurs when i was a kid.

29
00:01:56,866 --> 00:01:58,868
a lot of kids were.

30
00:01:58,868 --> 00:02:02,872
recently, the bones of a woman
who lived 20,000 years ago

31
00:02:02,872 --> 00:02:04,374
were found here.

32
00:02:04,874 --> 00:02:07,377
they nicknamed her
midland minnie.

33
00:02:07,877 --> 00:02:09,379
the first inhabitants here

34
00:02:09,879 --> 00:02:11,881
referred to themselves
simply as "the people."

35
00:02:11,881 --> 00:02:15,385
other groups
they came in contact with

36
00:02:15,385 --> 00:02:17,387
were referred
to as "friends."

37
00:02:17,387 --> 00:02:20,390
texas comes from
the caddoan word for friend.

38
00:02:20,390 --> 00:02:22,392
however, the caddo
were among the first

39
00:02:22,392 --> 00:02:24,894
to be wiped out by
early white settlers.

40
00:02:25,395 --> 00:02:26,896
a group of spanish settlers

41
00:02:27,397 --> 00:02:28,898
offered the indians
a chance to become slaves.

42
00:02:28,898 --> 00:02:32,402
the indians thought about it,
decided it was not a good idea,

43
00:02:32,402 --> 00:02:33,903
and killed the spaniards.

44
00:02:34,404 --> 00:02:37,407
the spaniards fought mexicans.
mexicans fought americans.

45
00:02:37,407 --> 00:02:41,411
americans fought the wichitas.
the wichitas fought tankowas.

46
00:02:41,411 --> 00:02:45,415
tankowas fought the comanches.
the comanches fought everyone.

47
00:02:45,415 --> 00:02:48,918
meanwhile, most people who
now lived here spoke spanish.

48
00:02:48,918 --> 00:02:50,920
covert military operations

49
00:02:50,920 --> 00:02:52,422
to seize texas
for the u.s. of a.

50
00:02:52,922 --> 00:02:54,424
were begun in 1835.

51
00:02:54,924 --> 00:02:57,927
eventually,
they did get texas.

52
00:02:57,927 --> 00:03:00,930
land grabbers,
railroad companies moved in.

53
00:03:00,930 --> 00:03:04,434
the economy boomed.
some people got rich--

54
00:03:04,934 --> 00:03:08,855
first on cotton,
then cattle, then oil,

55
00:03:08,855 --> 00:03:10,273
and now, microelectronics.

56
00:03:10,773 --> 00:03:15,778
the silicon-based transistor
was first proposed here in 1949.

57
00:03:15,778 --> 00:03:16,779
in 1958,

58
00:03:16,779 --> 00:03:19,782
mr. jack kilby invented
the integrated circuit.

59
00:03:19,782 --> 00:03:22,285
he was working
at texas instruments then.

60
00:03:22,285 --> 00:03:24,287
he doesn't work there anymore.

61
00:03:24,287 --> 00:03:28,791
this is the 150th anniversary
of the state of texas.

62
00:03:28,791 --> 00:03:33,796
prince charlie, duke of windsor,
prince of wales even came here

63
00:03:33,796 --> 00:03:36,799
for the sesquicentennial
opening ceremonies.

64
00:03:37,300 --> 00:03:39,802
this out here--
this is virgil, texas.

65
00:03:40,303 --> 00:03:42,805
their celebration's
gonna happen this friday.

66
00:03:43,306 --> 00:03:44,807
they're gonna have
a parade

67
00:03:45,308 --> 00:03:47,810
that runs down the main street
in the morning.

68
00:03:48,311 --> 00:03:50,813
and then outside of town
that night,

69
00:03:51,314 --> 00:03:53,816
they're gonna have
a talent show.

70
00:03:57,820 --> 00:04:00,823
you know,
in a couple of years,

71
00:04:00,823 --> 00:04:03,826
this'll probably all
be built up.

72
00:04:05,828 --> 00:04:08,331
radio reception's
great here!

73
00:04:18,841 --> 00:04:21,844
although the center of town
is pretty old,

74
00:04:21,844 --> 00:04:24,847
around the outside, there's been
a lot of people moving in,

75
00:04:25,348 --> 00:04:27,350
a lot of construction.

76
00:04:32,855 --> 00:04:34,357
plummet
right.

77
00:04:34,857 --> 00:04:35,858
steady!

78
00:04:36,359 --> 00:04:37,860
5.32.

79
00:04:38,861 --> 00:04:39,862
move on.

80
00:04:39,862 --> 00:04:42,365
this is where the stage
for the performances

81
00:04:42,365 --> 00:04:43,866
is gonna be built.

82
00:04:43,866 --> 00:04:46,369
it'll only take
a couple of days

83
00:04:46,869 --> 00:04:48,871
because it's all prefab.

84
00:04:48,871 --> 00:04:52,375
they'll get it done
just in time, i hope.

85
00:04:52,375 --> 00:04:55,378
do you think there'll
be enough parking, huh?

86
00:04:59,882 --> 00:05:01,384
4.50.

87
00:05:01,384 --> 00:05:02,885
good. move on.

88
00:05:11,894 --> 00:05:13,396
be there soon.

89
00:05:26,042 --> 00:05:30,046
many of virgil's festivities
are sponsored by varicorp.

90
00:05:30,046 --> 00:05:34,050
it's a major
public relations effort.

91
00:05:34,050 --> 00:05:36,052
they're calling it
a celebration of specialness.

92
00:05:36,052 --> 00:05:40,056
but this place
is completely normal.

93
00:05:40,056 --> 00:05:42,558
anyway, this is
the varicorp building

94
00:05:42,558 --> 00:05:45,561
just outside virgil.
it's cool.

95
00:05:45,561 --> 00:05:48,564
it's a multipurpose shape--
a box.

96
00:05:48,564 --> 00:05:52,568
we have no idea
what's inside there.

97
00:05:54,570 --> 00:05:58,574
going to the keg party
at don's tomorrow?

98
00:05:58,574 --> 00:06:00,576
love makes everything beautiful,
like a little puppy--

99
00:06:00,576 --> 00:06:06,582
warm and fuzzy.
you know, i like a hairy man.

100
00:06:06,582 --> 00:06:10,086
jesus was hairy.

101
00:06:10,086 --> 00:06:13,089
it's worth it
to fall in love,

102
00:06:13,089 --> 00:06:15,091
to see
the beautiful world.

103
00:06:15,591 --> 00:06:18,094
love is soft
and love is pure.

104
00:06:18,094 --> 00:06:20,596
love is something
that you must endure.

105
00:06:20,596 --> 00:06:23,599
love is peaceful
and love is wild.

106
00:06:23,599 --> 00:06:26,602
love's all right
if it lasts a while.

107
00:06:26,602 --> 00:06:29,605
i know everything there is
to know about love, honey.

108
00:06:29,605 --> 00:06:33,109
i have seen it all
and done it all.

109
00:06:33,109 --> 00:06:37,613
i love money,
and men like that.

110
00:06:37,613 --> 00:06:40,616
remember when i went out
with burt reynolds?

111
00:06:40,616 --> 00:06:44,120
shoot, he was gonna quit
the movies and live with me.

112
00:06:44,120 --> 00:06:48,124
i said, "burt, darlin',
i need all your money."

113
00:06:48,124 --> 00:06:50,626
he would have
given it to me.

114
00:06:50,626 --> 00:06:53,629
don't be afraid.
i'm gonna touch your nose.

115
00:06:53,629 --> 00:06:55,631
what's that
supposed to be?

116
00:06:55,631 --> 00:06:58,634
um, you see,
i can read your tones.

117
00:06:58,634 --> 00:07:00,136
everybody has tones.

118
00:07:00,636 --> 00:07:03,139
it's like everybody
has their own station,

119
00:07:03,639 --> 00:07:05,141
like a transmitter.

120
00:07:05,141 --> 00:07:08,144
i guess you have
your dial set.

121
00:07:08,144 --> 00:07:10,146
baby, i'm the only one
that has a radio.

122
00:07:10,146 --> 00:07:11,147
i'm picking you up.

123
00:07:11,647 --> 00:07:16,652
you're sort of cool,
sort of...hhhot!

124
00:07:16,652 --> 00:07:19,155
# baby, your mind
is a radio #

125
00:07:19,155 --> 00:07:22,158
# the receiver
is in my head #

126
00:07:22,658 --> 00:07:25,661
# baby, i'm tuned
to your wavelength #

127
00:07:25,661 --> 00:07:29,165
# let me tell you
what it says #

128
00:07:29,665 --> 00:07:31,167
# it's a transmitter #

129
00:07:31,167 --> 00:07:33,169
# da da da doom #

130
00:07:33,169 --> 00:07:36,672
# i'm picking up
something good #

131
00:07:36,672 --> 00:07:40,176
i like it.
i like it.

132
00:07:40,176 --> 00:07:43,679
seems to be a different
kind of attitude.

133
00:07:43,679 --> 00:07:46,182
yeah. something's
happening here, all right.

134
00:07:47,683 --> 00:07:49,602
the world is changing...

135
00:07:50,603 --> 00:07:53,606
and this is
the center of it right now.

136
00:07:53,606 --> 00:07:55,107
or the one of many centers.

137
00:07:55,107 --> 00:07:57,109
it's a lot like music.

138
00:07:57,109 --> 00:07:59,111
computers are like that.

139
00:07:59,111 --> 00:08:01,113
you can never explain

140
00:08:01,113 --> 00:08:05,618
the feelings or connections
to anyone else.

141
00:08:05,618 --> 00:08:07,119
figuring something out,

142
00:08:07,119 --> 00:08:12,124
something that's never
been understood before,

143
00:08:12,124 --> 00:08:15,628
is a rhythmic experience.

144
00:08:15,628 --> 00:08:17,630
steve jobs said that.

145
00:08:17,630 --> 00:08:20,633
he used to be
the head of apple.

146
00:08:22,635 --> 00:08:24,136
thanks.

147
00:08:24,136 --> 00:08:27,139
you know, some people
in the computer business

148
00:08:27,139 --> 00:08:28,641
can be pretty creative,

149
00:08:28,641 --> 00:08:32,144
unlike the traditional
businessman.

150
00:08:32,144 --> 00:08:36,148
you know, the astronauts
didn't read poetry.

151
00:08:36,148 --> 00:08:38,150
but that's changing.

152
00:08:41,654 --> 00:08:42,655
hi, gary.

153
00:08:42,655 --> 00:08:44,156
this is an exciting
place to work?

154
00:08:44,156 --> 00:08:46,659
yeah, i guess i'd say so.

155
00:08:47,159 --> 00:08:50,980
computers are as much a means
of expression as language.

156
00:08:51,948 --> 00:08:53,449
hi!

157
00:08:55,451 --> 00:08:58,955
my name is louis--
louis fyne.

158
00:08:58,955 --> 00:09:02,959
i've been working here
a number of years.

159
00:09:02,959 --> 00:09:05,962
now i'm in the clean room.

160
00:09:05,962 --> 00:09:07,964
it's pretty ok.

161
00:09:07,964 --> 00:09:10,967
i go out at night.

162
00:09:10,967 --> 00:09:13,469
i'm a dancin' fool!

163
00:09:13,469 --> 00:09:15,972
ha ha! ha ha!

164
00:09:15,972 --> 00:09:17,974
i'll tell you what.

165
00:09:20,476 --> 00:09:21,978
whew!

166
00:09:21,978 --> 00:09:23,980
i love the women.

167
00:09:23,980 --> 00:09:26,983
hey, there's more to life
than this job.

168
00:09:26,983 --> 00:09:29,986
no offense, you understand.
i'm no swinger. not louis.

169
00:09:30,486 --> 00:09:33,489
i want to settle down.
it would be beautiful.

170
00:09:33,489 --> 00:09:36,492
hey, these machines are great.
they're amazing.

171
00:09:36,492 --> 00:09:39,996
i tried a computer
dating service once.

172
00:09:39,996 --> 00:09:42,999
wound up with a midget.

173
00:09:42,999 --> 00:09:46,502
i mean, i'm not
a fussy man, but...whew!

174
00:09:46,502 --> 00:09:49,505
louis, tell me,
do you like children?

175
00:09:49,505 --> 00:09:51,007
they're lovely.

176
00:09:51,007 --> 00:09:55,511
well, do you know
all the kids' names by now?

177
00:09:55,511 --> 00:09:58,514
uh...what, are they
sitting alphabetically?

178
00:09:58,514 --> 00:10:01,517
i want someone
to share my life.

179
00:10:01,517 --> 00:10:06,522
marriage is a natural thing,
and i'm a natural man.

180
00:10:06,522 --> 00:10:08,524
louis, i'd like
to teach you

181
00:10:08,524 --> 00:10:10,026
the lotus position.

182
00:10:10,026 --> 00:10:12,528
moonstone,
i'd like to learn it,

183
00:10:12,528 --> 00:10:16,949
but i sit all day at work,
so i'm not flexible.

184
00:10:17,450 --> 00:10:18,451
just take one foot,

185
00:10:18,951 --> 00:10:20,953
place it on
the opposite thigh.

186
00:10:21,454 --> 00:10:24,457
gently. this is the most
awesome yoga position.

187
00:10:24,457 --> 00:10:26,425
well, if it's awesome...

188
00:10:26,425 --> 00:10:28,928
take the other foot.

189
00:10:29,929 --> 00:10:33,933
this one goes here,
very gently.

190
00:10:33,933 --> 00:10:36,435
no, careful, careful.

191
00:10:36,435 --> 00:10:37,937
very gently.

192
00:10:37,937 --> 00:10:40,439
here, let me help you.

193
00:10:40,439 --> 00:10:44,443
no, no. that's
a different position.

194
00:10:44,443 --> 00:10:47,446
back this way, louis.

195
00:10:47,446 --> 00:10:49,949
there. oh, you're doing
very well.

196
00:10:49,949 --> 00:10:51,450
got it?

197
00:10:51,450 --> 00:10:54,103
it's close. very good.

198
00:10:57,573 --> 00:11:00,576
well,
i suppose these freeways

199
00:11:00,576 --> 00:11:04,080
made this town and a lot
of others like it possible.

200
00:11:04,080 --> 00:11:07,583
they're the cathedrals
of our time, someone said.

201
00:11:07,583 --> 00:11:10,086
not me.

202
00:11:11,587 --> 00:11:14,590
you know, around here
they have names

203
00:11:14,590 --> 00:11:17,593
for the various kinds
of freeway drivers.

204
00:11:17,593 --> 00:11:19,095
the slingshotter.

205
00:11:19,095 --> 00:11:21,097
the adventurer.

206
00:11:21,097 --> 00:11:23,099
the marshmallow.

207
00:11:23,099 --> 00:11:25,601
the nomad.

208
00:11:25,601 --> 00:11:27,603
and the weaver.

209
00:11:31,107 --> 00:11:34,110
yup, it's fancy driving,
all right.

210
00:11:34,610 --> 00:11:38,114
you know, things that never
had names before

211
00:11:38,114 --> 00:11:40,616
are now easily described.

212
00:11:41,117 --> 00:11:42,618
it makes conversation easy.

213
00:11:56,132 --> 00:11:58,134
i have something to say

214
00:11:58,134 --> 00:12:03,139
about the difference between
american and european cities...

215
00:12:03,139 --> 00:12:06,142
but i forgot
what it is.

216
00:12:06,142 --> 00:12:09,645
i have it written down
at home somewhere.

217
00:12:16,152 --> 00:12:18,154
you like music?

218
00:12:18,154 --> 00:12:19,655
oh, i know.

219
00:12:20,156 --> 00:12:22,658
everybody says they do.

220
00:12:23,159 --> 00:12:26,662
look.
i personally believe...

221
00:12:26,662 --> 00:12:29,665
i can see
fort worth from here.

222
00:12:34,170 --> 00:12:38,174
most people around here
have eaten dinner already.

223
00:12:38,174 --> 00:12:42,678
don't want to be late.
know what i mean?

224
00:12:42,678 --> 00:12:44,647
or do you?

225
00:12:48,651 --> 00:12:50,653
you've got to see this.

226
00:12:50,653 --> 00:12:54,156
this might be part of virgil's
celebration of specialness...

227
00:12:54,156 --> 00:12:56,158
or it might not be.

228
00:12:56,158 --> 00:12:59,161
you might have
seen it on television...

229
00:12:59,662 --> 00:13:01,664
or maybe you missed it.

230
00:13:01,664 --> 00:13:04,667
hope you don't mind
loud music.

231
00:13:07,169 --> 00:13:09,171
all right, friends. welcome.

232
00:13:09,672 --> 00:13:13,175
crazy cajun talking at you
in virgil city tonight

233
00:13:13,175 --> 00:13:16,178
where everybody
always has a good time.

234
00:13:16,178 --> 00:13:17,680
we're gonna pass you
some of that good time tonight.

235
00:13:17,680 --> 00:13:21,684
in this drink, they mix
6 different kinds of liquor,

236
00:13:21,684 --> 00:13:24,186
but it don't taste
too strong.

237
00:13:24,186 --> 00:13:26,689
would you like
a raffle ticket?

238
00:13:26,689 --> 00:13:28,691
they're $2.50
for the car.

239
00:13:28,691 --> 00:13:29,692
thanks, ola.

240
00:13:29,692 --> 00:13:31,694
d.j.: you,
you are the video...

241
00:13:31,694 --> 00:13:33,696
i feel like getting
drunk tonight.

242
00:13:33,696 --> 00:13:35,698
how about you?

243
00:13:35,698 --> 00:13:38,701
when i was a nurse
in vietnam,

244
00:13:38,701 --> 00:13:40,202
i was stuck out in
the middle of the jungle

245
00:13:40,703 --> 00:13:42,705
with the real rambo.

246
00:13:42,705 --> 00:13:45,207
he had the hots for me.

247
00:13:45,207 --> 00:13:47,626
i mean, he was
driving me crazy.

248
00:13:47,626 --> 00:13:49,628
of course, it would be
difficult for anybody

249
00:13:49,628 --> 00:13:52,131
not to fall in love with
you in that humidity.

250
00:13:52,631 --> 00:13:55,134
and i saved his life
about 50 times.

251
00:13:55,634 --> 00:13:58,637
i bet you've seen me
here before.

252
00:13:58,637 --> 00:14:01,140
rrroar! ha ha!

253
00:14:01,140 --> 00:14:03,142
i'm the dancing bear.

254
00:14:03,142 --> 00:14:04,643
hi, louis.

255
00:14:04,643 --> 00:14:07,563
you gonna dance
in the show on friday?

256
00:14:07,563 --> 00:14:09,565
yeah, but...
excuse us.

257
00:14:09,565 --> 00:14:12,067
i'm still having trouble
with ladies.

258
00:14:12,067 --> 00:14:14,069
buddy, i'll tell you.

259
00:14:14,069 --> 00:14:18,574
fact--there are 1/2 million
more single guys

260
00:14:18,574 --> 00:14:21,577
than there are gals,
and the competition is tough.

261
00:14:21,577 --> 00:14:24,580
we're gonna have a good time.
do it to it.

262
00:14:25,080 --> 00:14:26,999
most of them
just want to swing

263
00:14:26,999 --> 00:14:30,002
or aren't
really serious.

264
00:14:33,505 --> 00:14:37,009
some of these gals
are as bad as the guys.

265
00:14:37,509 --> 00:14:39,011
that's mine, there.

266
00:14:39,511 --> 00:14:41,513
i'll take
the red one.

267
00:14:41,513 --> 00:14:45,935
we got a song coming up
calledwild, wild life.

268
00:14:45,935 --> 00:14:49,438
i want you to lip-synch it.

269
00:14:49,438 --> 00:14:52,441

274
00:15:01,450 --> 00:15:02,952

275
00:15:02,952 --> 00:15:04,954

# things fall apart #

322
00:17:56,909 --> 00:17:59,411
# it's scientific #

323
00:17:59,411 --> 00:18:02,915
# sleeping on the interstate,
oh ho ho #

324
00:18:02,915 --> 00:18:06,418
# gettin' wild, wild life #

325
00:18:06,418 --> 00:18:07,419
# checkin' in #

00:18:07,419 --> 00:18:09,421

00:18:09,922 --> 00:18:12,925

# i got a wild, wild life ?

328
00:18:12,925 --> 00:18:16,929
# spending all of my money
and time, oh ho ho #

329
00:18:16,929 --> 00:18:19,932
# done too much
wild, wild life #

330
00:18:19,932 --> 00:18:23,936
# we want to go where we go
where we go, oh ho ho #

331
00:18:23,936 --> 00:18:26,438
# i'm doin' wild, wild life #

332
00:18:26,438 --> 00:18:28,440
# you've grown so tall #

333
00:18:28,440 --> 00:18:31,443
# you've grown so fast,
oh ho ho #

334
00:18:31,944 --> 00:18:33,445
# wild, wild life #

335
00:18:33,445 --> 00:18:37,449
# and i know that's the way
you like it, oh ho #

336
00:18:37,950 --> 00:18:41,453
# livin' wild, wild,
wild, wild #

337
00:18:41,453 --> 00:18:44,957
# whoa ohh #

338
00:18:45,958 --> 00:18:48,460
woo! woo!

339
00:19:30,419 --> 00:19:33,922
tv: the el paso
border patrol...

340
00:19:38,427 --> 00:19:39,928
louis told me

341
00:19:39,928 --> 00:19:43,932
he heard about a woman
who lives around here

342
00:19:43,932 --> 00:19:46,435
and never gets out of bed.

343
00:19:46,435 --> 00:19:48,437
she's not sick.

344
00:19:48,437 --> 00:19:52,441
she's got enough money,
she doesn't have to.

345
00:19:52,441 --> 00:19:54,443
hey, wouldn't you?

346
00:19:55,944 --> 00:20:00,949
if i ever went downstairs,
i might be surprised, huh?

347
00:20:00,949 --> 00:20:04,953
it's clean down there,
isn't it, roberto?

348
00:20:04,953 --> 00:20:08,957
that girl does
a good job, doesn't she?

349
00:20:10,459 --> 00:20:12,961
it's so clean,
it scares me.

350
00:20:12,961 --> 00:20:15,464
the beauty operator
is coming over.

351
00:20:15,464 --> 00:20:19,968
hey, how should i have her
do me this time?

352
00:20:19,968 --> 00:20:22,471
should i get it moussed?

353
00:20:23,972 --> 00:20:26,975
ooo, look at that.
there's a look.

354
00:20:26,975 --> 00:20:30,979
what do you think about
the gals on this show?

355
00:20:30,979 --> 00:20:35,484
these people have too much metal
on them, miss rollings.

356
00:20:35,484 --> 00:20:37,486
they are reflecting
kind of people.

357
00:20:37,986 --> 00:20:41,490
you're right. how are those
shares of varicorp doing?

358
00:20:43,492 --> 00:20:44,993
about 30, 40.

359
00:20:44,993 --> 00:20:46,495
is that all?

360
00:20:46,495 --> 00:20:47,996
that's about it.

361
00:20:47,996 --> 00:20:52,501
well, i'm not surprised.
cheap little pig shits.

362
00:20:52,501 --> 00:20:55,938
it's the same all over.

363
00:20:55,938 --> 00:20:59,424
bunch of maniacs
out there. woo!

364
00:20:59,424 --> 00:21:03,428
you know how hot dogs come
10 to a pack

365
00:21:03,428 --> 00:21:06,431
and buns in packs
of 8 or 12?

366
00:21:06,431 --> 00:21:11,436
you've got to buy 9 packs
to make them all match up.

367
00:21:11,436 --> 00:21:13,939
that's what
i'm talking about.

368
00:21:19,995 --> 00:21:21,997
since this mall opened,

369
00:21:21,997 --> 00:21:25,500
c.r. anthony, jcpenney,
and even duke and ayers

370
00:21:25,500 --> 00:21:28,003
all pulled out
of downtown virgil.

371
00:21:28,003 --> 00:21:31,006
shoppers here go wherever
the bargains are,

372
00:21:31,006 --> 00:21:33,008
wherever it's convenient
to shop.

373
00:21:33,008 --> 00:21:37,012
they don't care if they shop
in a funky old building downtown

374
00:21:37,012 --> 00:21:40,015
or in a clean, modern place
like this.

375
00:21:42,517 --> 00:21:46,021
see, they're wise
to advertisers' claims.

376
00:21:46,021 --> 00:21:50,025
in a place like this,
they can comparison shop.

377
00:21:50,025 --> 00:21:51,526
everybody could hardly wait
until the mall opened...

378
00:21:51,526 --> 00:21:53,028
except margie ortiz.

379
00:21:53,028 --> 00:21:58,533
i go there almost every weekend.
so do 2 other girls from work.

380
00:21:58,533 --> 00:22:00,035
see? i told you.

381
00:22:08,043 --> 00:22:11,046
the shopping mall
has replaced the town square

382
00:22:11,046 --> 00:22:14,049
as the center
of many american cities.

383
00:22:14,049 --> 00:22:17,052
shopping itself has become

384
00:22:17,052 --> 00:22:20,555
the activity
that brings people together.

385
00:22:20,555 --> 00:22:24,559
and here,
the music's always playing.

386
00:22:24,559 --> 00:22:27,062
what time is it?

387
00:22:27,062 --> 00:22:29,064
no time to look back.

388
00:22:29,064 --> 00:22:32,567
men: ha ha ha!

389
00:22:32,567 --> 00:22:35,570
"starving peasants
sell their bodies

390
00:22:35,570 --> 00:22:37,572
to vampires
for blood money!"

391
00:22:37,572 --> 00:22:39,074
ha ha ha!

392
00:22:50,585 --> 00:22:53,088
stores here
are pretty clean.

393
00:22:53,088 --> 00:22:55,090
the air is fresh.

394
00:22:55,090 --> 00:22:59,094
there's plenty of parking,
plenty of space to walk around.

395
00:22:59,094 --> 00:23:02,097
hi, how are you? how
come you're not at work?

396
00:23:02,597 --> 00:23:05,600
oh, i'm working on
a project at home.

397
00:23:05,600 --> 00:23:07,602
i send signals up.

398
00:23:07,602 --> 00:23:09,104
oh, to satellites
and things.

399
00:23:09,104 --> 00:23:11,606
further than that,
i hope.

400
00:23:11,606 --> 00:23:13,108
oh.

401
00:23:13,108 --> 00:23:16,111
hey, i've got to get to work
before all hell breaks loose.

402
00:23:16,111 --> 00:23:17,612
oh.

403
00:23:17,612 --> 00:23:18,613
see you.

404
00:23:22,617 --> 00:23:27,622
people here are inventing
their own system of beliefs.

405
00:23:27,622 --> 00:23:29,124
they're creating it...

406
00:23:29,124 --> 00:23:31,126
doing it...

407
00:23:31,126 --> 00:23:33,628
selling it...

408
00:23:33,628 --> 00:23:36,631
making it up
as they go along.

409
00:23:39,134 --> 00:23:41,136
driving...

410
00:23:41,136 --> 00:23:44,639
not only driving,
but parking.

411
00:23:46,141 --> 00:23:48,143
hey, there's louis!

412
00:23:48,143 --> 00:23:49,644
hi, how you doing?

413
00:23:49,644 --> 00:23:50,645
pretty good.

414
00:23:50,645 --> 00:23:53,648
did you have
any luck at the club?

415
00:23:53,648 --> 00:23:55,650
the women
are too wild.

416
00:23:55,650 --> 00:23:58,153
i had a good time
anyway.

417
00:23:58,153 --> 00:24:00,155
look at these women.

418
00:24:00,155 --> 00:24:04,159
yeah, a little
too old for me.

419
00:24:04,159 --> 00:24:06,161
what are you
doing here?

420
00:24:06,161 --> 00:24:09,164
i thought i'd check out
that fashion show.

421
00:24:09,164 --> 00:24:11,666
part of the celebration.

422
00:24:11,666 --> 00:24:12,667
twins.

423
00:24:12,667 --> 00:24:14,169
carol and daryl.

424
00:24:14,169 --> 00:24:15,670
i knew their mama
in high school.

425
00:24:15,670 --> 00:24:18,173
she was a twin, too.
hi, twins.

426
00:24:19,174 --> 00:24:22,177
i just thought
i'd check it out.

427
00:24:22,177 --> 00:24:24,179
maybe i'd pick up
a few fashion tips.

428
00:24:24,179 --> 00:24:28,183
you know, i'm very aware
of my appearance.

429
00:24:28,183 --> 00:24:29,684
i've noticed.

430
00:24:29,684 --> 00:24:32,687
yeah. well, just
check these out here.

431
00:24:32,687 --> 00:24:34,189
those are great!

432
00:24:34,189 --> 00:24:35,190
yeah.

433
00:24:39,194 --> 00:24:41,196
yep.

434
00:24:43,198 --> 00:24:44,199
like the song says,

435
00:24:44,699 --> 00:24:46,701
it's a scientific
lifestyle.

436
00:24:47,202 --> 00:24:48,703
hmm. i don't know
that one.

437
00:24:49,204 --> 00:24:50,705
p.a.: good afternoon,
ladies and gentlemen,

438
00:24:50,705 --> 00:24:52,707
and welcome to
another lovely event

439
00:24:52,707 --> 00:24:54,910
for the celebration
of specialness.

440
00:24:54,910 --> 00:24:56,411
today we have
a fashion show,

441
00:24:56,912 --> 00:24:59,915
and i think it's gonna be
something you'll just love.

442
00:24:59,915 --> 00:25:02,417
it's very unusual.
so come on!

443
00:25:02,417 --> 00:25:04,419
let's bring on the show!

444
00:25:04,419 --> 00:25:09,424
from the dream factory,
a bonanza of beauty!

445
00:25:09,424 --> 00:25:11,927
this place is
filled with women.

446
00:25:11,927 --> 00:25:13,929
kay: i'd like
to remind you

447
00:25:13,929 --> 00:25:15,931
there's another event
this friday night....

448
00:25:15,931 --> 00:25:17,933
that's kay culver.

449
00:25:17,933 --> 00:25:20,435
for the celebration
of specialness.

450
00:25:20,435 --> 00:25:22,437
she's married to earl.
you've heard of him.

451
00:25:22,437 --> 00:25:24,439
he pretty much
single-handedly

452
00:25:24,439 --> 00:25:26,441
brought varicorp
to virgil.

453
00:25:26,441 --> 00:25:29,945
you know, i bet
this mall wouldn't be here

454
00:25:29,945 --> 00:25:31,947
if it wasn't for him.

455
00:25:31,947 --> 00:25:33,448
oh, yeah?

456
00:25:33,448 --> 00:25:35,450
i'm having dinner
with him later.

457
00:25:35,450 --> 00:25:39,454
well, listen.
i heard that earl and kay

458
00:25:39,454 --> 00:25:41,957
haven't spoken to
one another in years...

459
00:25:41,957 --> 00:25:44,459
at least, not directly.

460
00:25:44,459 --> 00:25:46,461
do you believe it?

461
00:25:47,963 --> 00:25:49,464
ok.

462
00:25:49,965 --> 00:25:52,467
what time is it?

463
00:25:52,467 --> 00:25:57,472
if everyone notices,
maybe it's too much.

464
00:25:57,472 --> 00:26:00,475
but where would we be?

465
00:26:00,475 --> 00:26:03,478
$29.95 is
a pretty good price.

466
00:26:03,478 --> 00:26:06,481
with 6 outfits
and as many combinations,

467
00:26:06,481 --> 00:26:08,984
the possibilities are endless.

468
00:26:08,984 --> 00:26:10,986
shopping is a feeling.

469
00:26:10,986 --> 00:26:13,488
sometimes i get
a wobbly feeling.

470
00:26:13,488 --> 00:26:15,991
i have a commercial feeling.

471
00:26:15,991 --> 00:26:18,994
be sexy in business.

472
00:26:18,994 --> 00:26:21,496
be successful at night.

473
00:26:21,997 --> 00:26:25,500
i stole it
off of a spaceship.

474
00:26:25,500 --> 00:26:29,004
...and coordinate
your outfit to match.

475
00:26:29,004 --> 00:26:32,007
let the children
do the shopping.

476
00:26:32,007 --> 00:26:37,012
if the room is pink,
you're in the pink.

477
00:26:37,012 --> 00:26:41,016
you have a right.
it's all you.

478
00:26:41,016 --> 00:26:44,019
there ought to be a law.

479
00:26:45,020 --> 00:26:47,022
# when you were little #

480
00:26:47,022 --> 00:26:50,025
#
# you dreamed you were big

481
00:26:50,025 --> 00:26:53,028
#
# you must have been something

482
00:26:53,028 --> 00:26:55,030
# a real tiny kid #

483
00:26:55,030 --> 00:26:57,532
# you wish you were me #

484
00:26:57,532 --> 00:27:00,535
# i wish i was you #

485
00:27:01,036 --> 00:27:03,038
# don't you wake up #

486
00:27:03,038 --> 00:27:08,043
#
# the dream will come true

487
00:27:08,043 --> 00:27:11,046
# every dream #

488
00:27:11,546 --> 00:27:15,050
# has a name #

489
00:27:15,050 --> 00:27:19,471
# and names tell your story #

490
00:27:19,471 --> 00:27:24,976
?
# this song is your dream ?

491
00:27:24,976 --> 00:27:30,982
# you're the dream operator #

492
00:27:35,904 --> 00:27:38,907
ohh! ahh!

493
00:27:40,408 --> 00:27:42,911
# it's bigger than life #

494
00:27:43,411 --> 00:27:44,913
# you know it's all me #

495
00:27:45,413 --> 00:27:48,416
# my face is a book #

496
00:27:48,917 --> 00:27:50,919
# but it's not what it seems #

497
00:27:51,419 --> 00:27:53,922
# three angels above #

498
00:27:53,922 --> 00:27:55,924
# the whole human race #

499
00:27:56,424 --> 00:27:58,927
# dreamed us to life #

500
00:27:58,927 --> 00:28:03,932
# they dream me a face #

501
00:28:04,432 --> 00:28:06,935
# and every dream #

502
00:28:07,435 --> 00:28:09,938
# tells it all #

503
00:28:09,938 --> 00:28:15,360
# and this is your story #

504
00:28:15,360 --> 00:28:20,865
# you dreamed me a heart #

505
00:28:20,865 --> 00:28:25,870
# you're the dream operator #

506
00:28:29,374 --> 00:28:32,377
# shake-it-up dream #

507
00:28:35,380 --> 00:28:38,383
# hi-de-ho dream #

508
00:28:40,385 --> 00:28:42,887
# fix-it-up dream #

509
00:28:42,887 --> 00:28:44,389
hmm.

510
00:28:45,390 --> 00:28:50,395
# look at me dream #

511
00:28:50,395 --> 00:28:55,400
# i've been waiting so long #

512
00:28:55,400 --> 00:29:00,905
# now i am your dream #

513
00:29:01,906 --> 00:29:04,409
# hard to forget #

514
00:29:04,909 --> 00:29:06,911
# hard to go on #

515
00:29:06,911 --> 00:29:08,913
# when you fall asleep #

516
00:29:08,913 --> 00:29:11,916
# you're out on your own #

517
00:29:11,916 --> 00:29:14,419
# let go of your life #

518
00:29:14,419 --> 00:29:17,422
# grab onto my hand #

519
00:29:17,922 --> 00:29:19,924
# here in the clouds #

520
00:29:19,924 --> 00:29:23,928
# the world understands #

521
00:29:26,431 --> 00:29:30,435
# and you dreamed it all #

522
00:29:30,435 --> 00:29:35,440
# and this is your story #

523
00:29:35,440 --> 00:29:38,943
# do you know #

524
00:29:38,943 --> 00:29:40,945
# who you are? #

525
00:29:41,446 --> 00:29:47,368
# you're the dream operator #

526
00:29:47,869 --> 00:29:49,871
darling!

527
00:30:02,550 --> 00:30:06,554
you know, i don't think
i've felt this way before.

528
00:30:06,554 --> 00:30:08,056
i know.

529
00:30:08,056 --> 00:30:09,557
me neither.

530
00:30:12,060 --> 00:30:14,562
my stomach feels
all fluttery.

531
00:30:14,562 --> 00:30:17,065
it's great,
though, huh?

532
00:30:17,065 --> 00:30:21,069
yeah, i--i guess.

533
00:30:21,069 --> 00:30:25,573
people at work must think
i'm going nuts, though.

534
00:30:26,074 --> 00:30:28,076
well, if this is
being nuts,

535
00:30:28,076 --> 00:30:30,078
then i don't ever
want to be sane.

536
00:30:36,084 --> 00:30:38,086
ah.

537
00:30:38,086 --> 00:30:40,588
oh, did you fart?

538
00:30:59,107 --> 00:31:01,109
i'm in
construction business.

539
00:31:01,609 --> 00:31:03,611
got work going on
at 5 sites now.

540
00:31:04,112 --> 00:31:07,615
bought me a condo
last week.

541
00:31:07,615 --> 00:31:10,118
shoot, real close to here,
as a matter of fact.

542
00:31:10,618 --> 00:31:13,121
next week, i might buy me
another house.

543
00:31:13,621 --> 00:31:16,624
darlin', i'll tell you what,
i just have a feel for it.

544
00:31:17,125 --> 00:31:18,543
you know what i mean?

545
00:31:18,543 --> 00:31:21,045
of course, bein' overly psychic
sure didn't hurt anything.

546
00:31:21,045 --> 00:31:23,047
it's paid off for me.

547
00:31:23,047 --> 00:31:25,550
listen, mr. frye,
i'll tell you--

548
00:31:25,550 --> 00:31:27,051
fyne.

549
00:31:27,051 --> 00:31:28,553
louis.

550
00:31:28,553 --> 00:31:30,555
louis, darlin',
i'll tell you somethin'

551
00:31:30,555 --> 00:31:34,559
if you promise not to tell
another livin' soul.

552
00:31:34,559 --> 00:31:36,561
now, i'd never tell this
to anybody else,

553
00:31:36,561 --> 00:31:40,064
but i believe that part
of my extrapsychic ability

554
00:31:40,064 --> 00:31:43,568
is connected up with the fact
that i was born with a tail,

555
00:31:43,568 --> 00:31:48,072
a little old bitty hairy thing
about that long.

556
00:31:48,072 --> 00:31:51,075
had it surgically removed
when i was just 5 years old.

557
00:31:51,075 --> 00:31:55,580
my mama kept it in a fruit jar
up in the medicine cabinet

558
00:31:55,580 --> 00:31:58,583
between the cold tablets
and the monkey blood.

559
00:31:58,583 --> 00:32:00,585
i'd get up every mornin'
first thing

560
00:32:00,585 --> 00:32:03,087
and go in there
and brush my teeth

561
00:32:03,087 --> 00:32:07,091
and stare at my own tail
at the same time.

562
00:32:07,091 --> 00:32:09,093
somethin' like that
can give you power,

563
00:32:09,093 --> 00:32:11,095
and that's the truth.

564
00:32:11,095 --> 00:32:12,597
then mama got
a wild hair one sunday

565
00:32:13,097 --> 00:32:15,600
and she decided to go make
a lot of money off of it.

566
00:32:15,600 --> 00:32:17,602
took it out to the swap meet

567
00:32:17,602 --> 00:32:20,605
and sold it to lyndon johnson's
top secret service agent.

568
00:32:20,605 --> 00:32:23,107
and he told a good
personal friend of mine

569
00:32:23,107 --> 00:32:25,109
that he was going to sell it
for even more money

570
00:32:25,109 --> 00:32:29,614
to the smithsonian institute.
i said he might as well.

571
00:32:29,614 --> 00:32:33,117
it wouldn't do him any good.
it wasn't his tail.

572
00:32:33,117 --> 00:32:35,620
gee, i tell you,
i could write a book.

573
00:32:35,620 --> 00:32:37,622
that thing would be
a best seller.

574
00:32:37,622 --> 00:32:39,624
you know, that's funny
you mentioned writing.

575
00:32:39,624 --> 00:32:42,126
i'm...kind
of a writer myself.

576
00:32:42,627 --> 00:32:43,628
is that right?

577
00:32:43,628 --> 00:32:45,129
i wrote me a song

578
00:32:45,630 --> 00:32:47,632
i want to do
at the show friday.

579
00:32:47,632 --> 00:32:50,635
i hope it turns out
all right.

580
00:32:50,635 --> 00:32:52,637
i'm a little nervous.

581
00:32:52,637 --> 00:32:55,139
don't be nervous.
songs are easy.

582
00:32:55,139 --> 00:32:57,642
i wrotebilly jean
and half of elvis' songs.

583
00:32:57,642 --> 00:32:58,643
elvis?

584
00:32:59,143 --> 00:33:01,646
hell, yes. they pay me,
and i keep quiet.

585
00:33:01,646 --> 00:33:04,148
you know,
somebody's got to do it.

586
00:33:04,649 --> 00:33:06,150
excuse me just a minute,
pumpkin.

587
00:33:06,651 --> 00:33:08,152
i'll be right back, ok?

588
00:33:08,653 --> 00:33:09,654
sure.

589
00:33:09,654 --> 00:33:11,656
i'll be right here.

590
00:33:54,449 --> 00:33:56,951
kay: shall we take a moment
and give our thanks?

591
00:33:57,452 --> 00:33:58,453
hmm?

592
00:34:09,964 --> 00:34:11,466
amen.

593
00:34:20,975 --> 00:34:23,978
linda, will you ask
your father

594
00:34:23,978 --> 00:34:26,981
to pass this down
to our guest?

595
00:34:26,981 --> 00:34:28,983
this looks great,
mrs. culver.

596
00:34:28,983 --> 00:34:31,486
dad, will you
pass this down?

597
00:34:31,486 --> 00:34:32,987
oh, yes.

598
00:34:32,987 --> 00:34:35,990
larry, would you
pass this down, please?

599
00:34:35,990 --> 00:34:37,492
thank you.

600
00:34:39,494 --> 00:34:41,996
linda, would you ask
your mother

601
00:34:41,996 --> 00:34:44,999
to pass the mustard
to our guest, please?

602
00:34:44,999 --> 00:34:47,001
mom, dad wants the mustard.

603
00:34:51,506 --> 00:34:53,007
dear.

604
00:34:53,007 --> 00:34:54,509
thank you.

605
00:34:56,010 --> 00:34:58,513
look out for your water, now.

606
00:34:58,513 --> 00:35:01,015
pass it down to our guest.

607
00:35:01,015 --> 00:35:03,518
let me grab one of these.
they're colorful.

608
00:35:03,518 --> 00:35:06,521
linda, would you ask
your mom

609
00:35:06,521 --> 00:35:08,523
how the fashion show went?

610
00:35:08,523 --> 00:35:11,025
mom, how did it go
today?

611
00:35:11,025 --> 00:35:13,528
oh, linda, tell him
it was just wonderful,

612
00:35:13,528 --> 00:35:15,530
although one woman
did have a accident,

613
00:35:16,030 --> 00:35:17,532
but it wasn't
anything serious.

614
00:35:17,532 --> 00:35:21,035
he should have come.
he would have been proud.

615
00:35:21,035 --> 00:35:24,539
it went great, dad.
you should have been there.

616
00:35:24,539 --> 00:35:25,540
maybe next time.

617
00:35:25,540 --> 00:35:27,041
i was there.

618
00:35:27,041 --> 00:35:28,543
i liked it.

619
00:35:28,543 --> 00:35:31,045
i'd never seen
anything like that.

620
00:35:31,045 --> 00:35:34,549
i'd never been to one
of those things before.

621
00:35:35,049 --> 00:35:36,551
you do that
every year?

622
00:35:36,551 --> 00:35:39,554
oh, no, this is just for
the sesquicentennial.

623
00:35:39,554 --> 00:35:41,055
you're in
the parade?

624
00:35:41,055 --> 00:35:43,474
anderson auto
is lending us

625
00:35:43,474 --> 00:35:44,976
a red
convertible.

626
00:35:44,976 --> 00:35:45,977
hmm.

627
00:35:45,977 --> 00:35:48,980
right. larry may have
a future at varicorp.

628
00:35:48,980 --> 00:35:51,983
with his young discipline
and systems consciousness,

629
00:35:51,983 --> 00:35:54,485
he could go a long way,
and varicorp is growing

630
00:35:54,485 --> 00:35:55,987
like there's no tomorrow.

631
00:35:55,987 --> 00:35:58,489
let me show you what
i think is going on.

632
00:35:58,489 --> 00:36:00,491
do you hear music?

633
00:36:02,493 --> 00:36:04,996
is something wrong
with your sister?

634
00:36:04,996 --> 00:36:06,497
mainframe.

635
00:36:07,999 --> 00:36:10,001
microprocessor.

636
00:36:11,002 --> 00:36:12,503
semiconductor.

637
00:36:12,503 --> 00:36:14,005
all right, dad!

638
00:36:14,005 --> 00:36:15,006
now...

639
00:36:15,506 --> 00:36:17,508
if this is the town

640
00:36:18,009 --> 00:36:20,511
and here is
the workplace...

641
00:36:21,012 --> 00:36:23,014
with its goods...

642
00:36:28,519 --> 00:36:30,021
and distribution network...

643
00:36:32,023 --> 00:36:34,025
vroom!

644
00:36:34,025 --> 00:36:37,028
most middle-class people

645
00:36:37,028 --> 00:36:40,031
have worked for large
corporations like varicorp

646
00:36:40,031 --> 00:36:43,034
or for the government
itself,

647
00:36:43,034 --> 00:36:46,537
but now all that's
started to change.

648
00:36:46,537 --> 00:36:48,039
scientists and engineers
are moving off

649
00:36:48,539 --> 00:36:52,543
from those large corporations
like varicorp.

650
00:36:53,044 --> 00:36:54,545
they're beginning to start
their own companies,

651
00:36:55,046 --> 00:36:56,547
marketing new inventions.

652
00:36:56,547 --> 00:36:58,549
excuse me,
mr. culver.

653
00:36:58,549 --> 00:37:01,052
i forgot what
these peppers represent.

654
00:37:01,052 --> 00:37:04,055
ah-ha! it all spins back
to the middle.

655
00:37:04,055 --> 00:37:06,557
here we are right here,
in virgil.

656
00:37:06,557 --> 00:37:11,062
our way of doing business
has been based on the past.

657
00:37:11,062 --> 00:37:15,066
that's why we have to
keep these guys in virgil

658
00:37:15,066 --> 00:37:17,068
even though they
leave varicorp.

659
00:37:17,068 --> 00:37:19,070
for the time being,

660
00:37:19,070 --> 00:37:21,572
it's created
confusion and chaos!

661
00:37:21,572 --> 00:37:24,075
they don't work
for money anymore

662
00:37:24,075 --> 00:37:26,077
or to earn
a place in heaven,

663
00:37:26,077 --> 00:37:28,079
which was
a big motivating factor

664
00:37:28,079 --> 00:37:30,081
once upon a time,
believe you me.

665
00:37:30,581 --> 00:37:35,586
they're working and inventing
because they like it.

666
00:37:35,586 --> 00:37:38,589
economics has become
a spiritual thing.

667
00:37:38,589 --> 00:37:40,591
i must admit,
it frightens me a bit.

668
00:37:40,591 --> 00:37:42,593
they don't see
the difference

669
00:37:42,593 --> 00:37:44,595
between working
and not working.

670
00:37:44,595 --> 00:37:48,099
it's all become
a part of one's life.

671
00:37:48,099 --> 00:37:49,600
linda! larry!

672
00:37:49,600 --> 00:37:52,603
there's no concept
of weekends anymore.

673
00:38:27,555 --> 00:38:30,057
preacher: it thrills me.

674
00:38:30,057 --> 00:38:32,560
it thrills me!

675
00:38:32,560 --> 00:38:37,565
we can build a nation
inside a nation

676
00:38:37,565 --> 00:38:40,067
right where we are.

677
00:38:40,067 --> 00:38:41,569
the choice is yours.

678
00:38:43,070 --> 00:38:46,073
i'm not a joiner.

679
00:38:46,073 --> 00:38:49,577
i'm not a member
of the john birch society

680
00:38:49,577 --> 00:38:51,579
or the communist party,

681
00:38:51,579 --> 00:38:55,583
but let's look
at what's happened

682
00:38:55,583 --> 00:38:59,587
to the national morals
since world war ii.

683
00:38:59,587 --> 00:39:02,089
we lost the vietnam war.

684
00:39:02,089 --> 00:39:04,592
# # #

685
00:39:04,592 --> 00:39:08,596
the movies and the television
are filled with characters

686
00:39:08,596 --> 00:39:13,100
i don't even want to know,
not in this life.

687
00:39:13,100 --> 00:39:15,603
the farmer's in trouble.

688
00:39:15,603 --> 00:39:18,606
the small businessman
is in trouble.

689
00:39:18,606 --> 00:39:21,108
unemployment
is skyrocketing.

690
00:39:23,110 --> 00:39:27,114
texas is still paying
for john kennedy's death,

691
00:39:27,114 --> 00:39:28,616
my friends.

692
00:39:28,616 --> 00:39:32,119
woman: it was love that
killed john f. kennedy.

693
00:39:32,119 --> 00:39:33,621
he should have never
messed with me.

694
00:39:33,621 --> 00:39:37,124
oh, no, i know nothing,
your honor.

695
00:39:37,124 --> 00:39:40,628
they want me to speak
on60 minutes.

696
00:39:40,628 --> 00:39:43,130
mike wallace wants my body.

697
00:39:43,130 --> 00:39:45,633
i don't tell a soul.

698
00:39:45,633 --> 00:39:48,636
well, they gave me
so much money,

699
00:39:48,636 --> 00:39:50,638
what could i do?

700
00:39:51,138 --> 00:39:52,640
umm...thank you.

701
00:39:52,640 --> 00:39:55,643
that's exactly
what i'm talking about.

702
00:39:55,643 --> 00:40:00,147
now, let's look at who's been
running this country

703
00:40:00,147 --> 00:40:02,149
since world war ii.

704
00:40:07,655 --> 00:40:15,162
and they have some
involvement in all of these.

705
00:40:15,162 --> 00:40:16,664
what is the link?

706
00:40:17,665 --> 00:40:20,668
what do cars
have to do with books,

707
00:40:20,668 --> 00:40:22,670
you might ask.

708
00:40:22,670 --> 00:40:23,671
the trilateral commission

709
00:40:24,171 --> 00:40:25,673
with the council
on foreign relations,

710
00:40:25,673 --> 00:40:28,175
did you ever hear of them?

711
00:40:28,175 --> 00:40:30,177
well, neither did i,

712
00:40:30,177 --> 00:40:35,182
until i noticed
the chain of coincidence.

713
00:40:35,182 --> 00:40:40,688
they have members on the boards
of all the largest corporations.

714
00:40:40,688 --> 00:40:43,691
not one detail
has been left out.

715
00:40:43,691 --> 00:40:45,192
am i right?
do you feel it?

716
00:40:45,693 --> 00:40:48,195
do you know what
bobby ray inman was doing

717
00:40:48,195 --> 00:40:50,698
before he was running
the microelectronics

718
00:40:50,698 --> 00:40:52,700
and the computer tech
corporation?

719
00:40:52,700 --> 00:40:53,701
well, guess!

720
00:40:53,701 --> 00:40:58,205
a cia director.
it's public knowledge.

721
00:40:58,205 --> 00:41:01,208
do you run out of kleenex,
paper towels, and toilet paper

722
00:41:01,208 --> 00:41:04,712
at the same time?
you know it's true!

723
00:41:04,712 --> 00:41:06,213
it's all true!

724
00:41:06,213 --> 00:41:08,215
you remember how
governor white

725
00:41:08,215 --> 00:41:11,218
campaigned to
get the mcc here?

726
00:41:11,218 --> 00:41:13,721
do you know
what their goal is, huh?

727
00:41:13,721 --> 00:41:15,222
well, elvis did!

728
00:41:15,222 --> 00:41:18,225
artificial intelligence!
huh?

729
00:41:18,225 --> 00:41:21,228
robots! they'd like that,
wouldn't they?

730
00:41:21,228 --> 00:41:23,731
yes, sir!
sleep! sleep!

731
00:41:23,731 --> 00:41:26,734
one and one
does not equal two!

732
00:41:26,734 --> 00:41:27,735
no, sir!

733
00:41:27,735 --> 00:41:29,737
silicon gulch!
silicon prairie!

734
00:41:29,737 --> 00:41:32,239
silicon hill!
silicon valley!

735
00:41:32,239 --> 00:41:34,742
you'd better wake up.

00:45:22,219 --> 00:45:25,222
who do you think lives there?

806
00:45:27,224 --> 00:45:29,226
four-car garage.

807
00:45:32,229 --> 00:45:34,231
hope...

808
00:45:34,231 --> 00:45:36,233
fear...

809
00:45:36,233 --> 00:45:38,235
excitement...

810
00:45:39,737 --> 00:45:41,739
satisfaction.

811
00:45:41,739 --> 00:45:44,742
i'm going to give you
a clear vista

812
00:45:44,742 --> 00:45:47,745
of the edge
of the civilized world.

813
00:45:47,745 --> 00:45:50,748
it's like a game
of leapfrog.

814
00:45:50,748 --> 00:45:52,750
these houses, they keep
extending the town out

815
00:45:52,750 --> 00:45:54,251
further and further
every year.

816
00:45:54,752 --> 00:45:56,754
it's kind of weird
for the first person

817
00:45:56,754 --> 00:45:59,757
that moves into
a community like this.

818
00:45:59,757 --> 00:46:01,759
i'll bet it is.

819
00:46:01,759 --> 00:46:05,262
it's an imaginary landscape,
a place to raise kids.

820
00:46:05,262 --> 00:46:07,264
of course, nowadays
not everyone's having kids,

821
00:46:07,264 --> 00:46:09,266
with the end of the world
coming up and all.

822
00:46:09,266 --> 00:46:10,768
i mean, would you?

823
00:46:10,768 --> 00:46:12,269
no, not at all.

824
00:46:12,269 --> 00:46:17,274
not until after tomorrow,
after the show, huh?

825
00:46:17,274 --> 00:46:20,277
good morning, boys.
working hard, i see.

826
00:46:20,277 --> 00:46:22,279
a little coffee break?

827
00:46:22,279 --> 00:46:25,282
it's strange
when you look at a field

828
00:46:25,282 --> 00:46:26,784
and you say, "now,
i want a bathroom there

829
00:46:26,784 --> 00:46:28,786
and a kitchen over here."

830
00:46:28,786 --> 00:46:30,287
now, imagine that.

831
00:46:30,287 --> 00:46:33,290
here's a field.
take a look out.

832
00:46:33,290 --> 00:46:36,293
picture a house.
picture a lot of houses.

833
00:46:36,293 --> 00:46:39,596
what else is a field good for
but building houses?

834
00:46:43,100 --> 00:46:44,601

00:47:47,164 --> 00:47:49,166

852
00:47:49,166 --> 00:47:50,667

# hey, now, now #

860
00:48:16,977 --> 00:48:20,480
texas is the largest producer
of metal buildings.

861
00:48:20,981 --> 00:48:23,483
metal buildings are the dream
that modern architects had

862
00:48:23,483 --> 00:48:26,486
at the beginning of this century
finally come true,

863
00:48:26,987 --> 00:48:28,488
but they themselves
don't realize it.

864
00:48:28,989 --> 00:48:30,991
that's because
it doesn't take an architect

865
00:48:30,991 --> 00:48:32,993
to build a metal building.

866
00:48:32,993 --> 00:48:34,494
you just order them
out of a catalogue.

867
00:48:34,494 --> 00:48:36,997
just pick out your color,
the size you want,

868
00:48:36,997 --> 00:48:40,500
number of square feet, style,
what you need it for.

869
00:48:40,500 --> 00:48:42,502
it comes with a bunch of guys.

870
00:48:42,502 --> 00:48:44,504
they put it together in
a couple of days. maybe a week.

871
00:48:44,504 --> 00:48:46,506
there you go. you're all set
to go into business.

872
00:48:46,506 --> 00:48:49,009
just slap a sign in front.

873
00:48:53,513 --> 00:48:55,015
drive on over.

874
00:48:55,015 --> 00:48:57,517
oh. he's gonna get killed!

875
00:48:57,517 --> 00:48:59,019
watch out!

876
00:48:59,519 --> 00:49:02,522
tv: black and decker's
automatic shut-off iron...

877
00:49:03,023 --> 00:49:05,525
because even those
with the best memories

878
00:49:06,026 --> 00:49:09,029
can forget
to turn their irons off.

879
00:49:10,530 --> 00:49:13,033
whoa!
oh, look at him!

880
00:49:13,033 --> 00:49:15,035
look at that bald spot!

881
00:49:19,039 --> 00:49:21,041
i was so impressed,
i bought the company.

882
00:49:21,541 --> 00:49:23,543
oh! lucy!

883
00:49:23,543 --> 00:49:26,046
i love you, lucy!

884
00:49:26,046 --> 00:49:27,547

898
00:50:19,099 --> 00:50:20,600

# we got time on our hands #

903
00:50:27,107 --> 00:50:29,109
they look like sticks.

904
00:50:29,109 --> 00:50:32,612
# so leave the driving
to us #

905
00:50:33,113 --> 00:50:36,033
# and it's
the real thing... #

906
00:50:36,033 --> 00:50:39,536
god, they're both
in a straitjacket!

907
00:50:39,536 --> 00:50:41,538
they must've done
somethin' bad.

991
00:54:12,832 --> 00:54:14,834
well, they can be
awful cute.

992
00:54:14,834 --> 00:54:16,336
the little
fluffy kind.

993
00:54:16,336 --> 00:54:19,339
you know how they give them
to you in a basket?

994
00:54:19,339 --> 00:54:21,841
they're cute like that.

995
00:54:21,841 --> 00:54:24,344
i like music
a whole lot.

996
00:54:24,344 --> 00:54:26,346
what kind of music?

997
00:54:26,346 --> 00:54:27,847
oh, country music.

998
00:54:27,847 --> 00:54:29,349
you like country music?

999
00:54:29,349 --> 00:54:30,850
oh, you know i do!

1000
00:54:31,351 --> 00:54:32,852

00:54:33,353 --> 00:54:36,356
oh, hank williams

mm-hmm.

1006
00:54:42,862 --> 00:54:46,366
i think music is one
of the sweetest things,

1007
00:54:46,866 --> 00:54:49,369
and if it's sweet,
it's probably cute.

1008
00:54:49,869 --> 00:54:52,872
you can't have enough
sweetness in this world.

1009
00:54:52,872 --> 00:54:54,874
no, ma'am,
you can't.

1010
00:54:54,874 --> 00:54:58,378
as a matter of fact,
i've written a little song

1011
00:54:58,378 --> 00:55:01,381
i'm gonna sing at the show
tomorrow night.

1012
00:55:01,381 --> 00:55:04,884
it's about my life.
what else do i know, huh?

1013
00:55:04,884 --> 00:55:06,886
i'll give you
a little sneak preview.

1014
00:55:06,886 --> 00:55:08,388
would you?

1015
00:55:08,388 --> 00:55:10,390
you hold on right there.
i hope you like it.

1016
00:55:10,390 --> 00:55:13,893
it'd mean a lot to louis.

1017
00:55:13,893 --> 00:55:15,895
ahem!

1018
00:55:15,895 --> 00:55:17,897
hmm!

1019
00:55:20,317 --> 00:55:26,323
# in 195o, when i was born #

1020
00:55:26,823 --> 00:55:30,827
# papa--i haven't
written this verse quite yet #

1021
00:55:30,827 --> 00:55:33,330
# 6 feet tall #

1022
00:55:33,330 --> 00:55:37,834
# and size 12 shoes #

1023
00:55:37,834 --> 00:55:39,336
# na na na na

1024
00:55:39,336 --> 00:55:41,338
# people like us #

1025
00:55:41,838 --> 00:55:43,840
# we don't want freedom #

1026
00:55:43,840 --> 00:55:46,343
# we, uh,
meow meow meow meow #

1027
00:55:46,343 --> 00:55:52,349
# we just want #

1028
00:55:52,349 --> 00:55:59,356
# someone to love #

1029
00:56:02,859 --> 00:56:04,361
ta-da!

1030
00:56:04,361 --> 00:56:06,363
well, what did you think?

1031
00:56:06,863 --> 00:56:08,365
when you're singing,

1032
00:56:08,365 --> 00:56:11,868
your eye sockets
go back in your head

1033
00:56:11,868 --> 00:56:12,869
and your eyes
get beady.

1034
00:56:12,869 --> 00:56:14,871
what about my music?

1035
00:56:15,872 --> 00:56:18,375
it's awful sad.

1036
00:56:20,377 --> 00:56:24,381
i couldn't have that kind
of sadness in my life.

1037
00:56:24,381 --> 00:56:26,883
do you really
feel that way?

1038
00:56:26,883 --> 00:56:30,887
i'm--i never
thought about it.

1039
00:56:32,889 --> 00:56:35,392
maybe i am kind of sad.

1040
00:56:35,392 --> 00:56:37,394
i like sad songs.

1041
00:56:37,394 --> 00:56:41,398
they make me want
to lie on the floor.

1042
00:56:41,398 --> 00:56:44,901
old louis the bear
on the floor.

1043
00:56:58,915 --> 00:57:01,418
i guess i'll go now.

1044
00:57:04,421 --> 00:57:05,922
sorry.

1045
00:57:05,922 --> 00:57:08,925
itwasnice talkin' to you.

1046
00:57:11,928 --> 00:57:14,431
louis the bear...

1047
00:57:15,432 --> 00:57:17,434
out the door.

1048
00:57:17,434 --> 00:57:19,436
good-bye.

1049
00:57:25,442 --> 00:57:27,444
cheer up.

1050
00:57:29,696 --> 00:57:31,197
a little more bottom.

1051
00:57:31,197 --> 00:57:32,699
a little more?

1052
00:57:32,699 --> 00:57:34,701
always a little more bottom.

1053
00:57:34,701 --> 00:57:37,704

1055
00:57:55,221 --> 00:57:57,724

without paying.

1056
00:57:57,724 --> 00:57:59,726
i don't want to dance.

1057
00:57:59,726 --> 00:58:03,229
i just want to
talk to my friend ramon

1058
00:58:03,229 --> 00:58:04,731

00:58:23,666 --> 00:58:26,169

come right back out.

1065
00:58:26,169 --> 00:58:27,670
fine.

1066
00:58:27,670 --> 00:58:33,176
# san antonio,

1072
00:59:07,710 --> 00:59:08,711

1073
00:59:09,212 --> 00:59:11,714

1075
00:59:13,216 --> 00:59:13,716

1076
00:59:14,217 --> 00:59:16,219
did you
talk to him?

1077
00:59:16,219 --> 00:59:18,721
yeah, man.

1078
00:59:18,721 --> 00:59:21,724

1079
00:59:21,724 --> 00:59:23,226

1080
00:59:23,726 --> 00:59:29,232
# ...matamoros

1081
00:59:29,232 --> 00:59:37,023
# da lo mismo porque
alla saben gozar... #

1082
01:00:28,458 --> 01:00:31,961
tv:

1083
01:00:35,965 --> 01:00:37,967
tv: hold it right there.

1084
01:00:37,967 --> 01:00:40,970
hey, officer,
what's going on here?

1085
01:00:40,970 --> 01:00:43,973
come on. let's
get out of here.

1086
01:00:43,973 --> 01:00:45,475
i said freeze!

1087
01:00:45,475 --> 01:00:47,477
what's going on here?

1088
01:01:01,407 --> 01:01:03,910
uh...ahem!

1089
01:01:03,910 --> 01:01:06,412
ramon gave me
this address.

1090
01:01:06,412 --> 01:01:07,914
well, hi.

1091
01:01:07,914 --> 01:01:09,916
come on in.

1092
01:01:11,417 --> 01:01:13,419
did you bring
a photograph?

1093
01:01:16,422 --> 01:01:17,840
thank you.

1094
01:01:19,842 --> 01:01:22,345
you know, i'm new at this.

1095
01:01:23,846 --> 01:01:26,849
don't matter.
you don't have to believe.

1096
01:01:26,849 --> 01:01:29,852
if you follow directions,
you can't go wrong.

1097
01:01:32,855 --> 01:01:34,857
mm-hmm.

1098
01:01:34,857 --> 01:01:37,360
you want to
attract love.

1099
01:01:37,360 --> 01:01:40,363
ha ha!
how did you know?

1100
01:01:40,363 --> 01:01:43,282
your heart is too large.

1101
01:01:45,785 --> 01:01:48,287
you're an honest man.

1102
01:01:50,790 --> 01:01:54,794
matrimony...
it's my life,

1103
01:01:55,294 --> 01:01:56,295
and i want to
share my life.

1104
01:02:00,299 --> 01:02:02,802
i've tried
everything.

1105
01:02:03,302 --> 01:02:06,305
often our true nature
is not what we hope it is,

1106
01:02:06,305 --> 01:02:11,811
but you, in your case,
you're drawn to love.

1107
01:02:11,811 --> 01:02:14,814
whatever you think
is what you get.

1108
01:02:14,814 --> 01:02:17,316
love must be drawn to you.

1109
01:02:18,818 --> 01:02:22,321
come on and let me
take care of this here.

1110
01:02:23,322 --> 01:02:25,324
discharge
the negative forces

1111
01:02:25,324 --> 01:02:27,827
you have involuntarily
received.

1112
01:02:30,329 --> 01:02:32,331
remove anything
that's metallic.

1113
01:02:37,837 --> 01:02:40,339
now, this will
take some time.

1114
01:02:46,846 --> 01:02:48,848
um...

1115
01:02:48,848 --> 01:02:51,350
i'm going to sing
tomorrow night.

1116
01:02:52,852 --> 01:02:54,353
will this help?

1117
01:02:54,353 --> 01:02:56,856
i'll work on you
tonight and tomorrow.

1118
01:02:59,859 --> 01:03:01,360
take this.

1119
01:03:03,863 --> 01:03:06,365
close this.
like that.

1120
01:03:06,365 --> 01:03:10,870
now, drink
3 soda waters a day.

1121
01:03:10,870 --> 01:03:12,371
drink half
and throw half away.

1122
01:03:12,872 --> 01:03:15,875
drink half
and throw half away.

1123
01:03:15,875 --> 01:03:17,376
yeah. think positive.

1124
01:03:17,376 --> 01:03:20,880
don't let nothin' enter into
your mind that's negative.

1125
01:03:20,880 --> 01:03:24,383
if you do that and
have faith and believe,

1126
01:03:24,383 --> 01:03:25,384
you got it.

1127
01:03:25,384 --> 01:03:27,887
it's done.

1128
01:03:27,887 --> 01:03:30,807
go...and enjoy

a story i heard about texas

1214
01:09:06,942 --> 01:09:08,944
recently in a local tavern.

1215
01:09:08,944 --> 01:09:10,946
it seems god
was working around here,

1216
01:09:10,946 --> 01:09:13,949
trying to make it beautiful
like the rest of the world.

1217
01:09:13,949 --> 01:09:16,452
he had to knock off
because it was nighttime.

1218
01:09:16,452 --> 01:09:18,454
he said,
"i'll come back tomorrow

1219
01:09:18,454 --> 01:09:19,955
"and make it as pretty
as the rest of the world

1220
01:09:19,955 --> 01:09:22,958
with lakes and streams
and mountains and trees."

1221
01:09:22,958 --> 01:09:25,461
he got back the next day,

1222
01:09:25,461 --> 01:09:28,464
and he saw the ground had
hardened like concrete.

1223
01:09:28,464 --> 01:09:30,966
and he didn't want to
begin all over again. no.

1224
01:09:31,467 --> 01:09:34,386
in his infinite wisdom,
he had an idea.

1225
01:09:34,386 --> 01:09:37,389
he said,
"i know what i'll do.

1226
01:09:37,389 --> 01:09:41,861
i'll make some people
that like it this way."

1412
01:22:48,263 --> 01:22:49,764
hello?

1413
01:22:56,271 --> 01:22:57,272
yes.

1414
01:23:03,278 --> 01:23:06,281
louis: this place
is a dream palace.

1415
01:23:06,281 --> 01:23:07,782
did you see
the catalogue?

1416
01:23:07,782 --> 01:23:09,784
oh, no.
i didn't.

1417
01:23:09,784 --> 01:23:12,287
it's gorgeous!
you'll have to look.

1418
01:23:12,287 --> 01:23:13,788
well,
you're gorgeous.

1419
01:23:13,788 --> 01:23:15,790
he's awful cute,
too.

1420
01:23:15,790 --> 01:23:17,792
do you like
the colors?

1421
01:23:17,792 --> 01:23:19,294
man: she's
pretty, too.

1422
01:23:19,294 --> 01:23:21,296
i think you can see
varicorp from here.

1423
01:23:21,796 --> 01:23:24,799
where are you going
on your honeymoon?

1424
01:23:24,799 --> 01:23:27,268
the bear is
staying with me!

1425
01:23:27,268 --> 01:23:31,222
i think
he's from pluto,

1426
01:23:31,222 --> 01:23:33,224
or he might even be
from venus.

1427
01:23:33,224 --> 01:23:35,226
you know, he is
real good-looking.

1428
01:23:37,729 --> 01:23:41,733
this is not a rental car.
this is privately owned.

1429
01:23:42,734 --> 01:23:47,238
well...i really enjoyed
forgetting.

1430
01:23:47,238 --> 01:23:53,745
when i first come to a place,
i notice all the little details.

1431
01:23:54,245 --> 01:23:57,248
i notice the way the sky looks,
the color of white paper,

1432
01:23:57,749 --> 01:24:01,252
the way people walk,
doorknobs, everything.

1433
01:24:01,252 --> 01:24:03,254
then i get used
to the place,

1434
01:24:03,254 --> 01:24:06,257
and i don't
notice those things anymore.

1435
01:24:06,257 --> 01:24:08,259
so only by forgetting

1436
01:24:08,760 --> 01:24:11,696
can i see the place again
as it really is.

1437
01:24:11,696 --> 01:24:16,968
