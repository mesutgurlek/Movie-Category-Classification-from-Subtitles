1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:01,290
<i>So here's what</i>
<i>you missed on</i> Glee:

2
00:00:01,360 --> 00:00:03,890
<i>Nationals is in New York City,</i>
<i>and everyone's really excited.</i>

3
00:00:03,900 --> 00:00:05,210
<i>Jessie St. James</i>
<i>is back in town,</i>

4
00:00:05,210 --> 00:00:06,960
<i>and he's starting a show choir</i>
<i>consulting business.</i>

5
00:00:07,000 --> 00:00:08,130
Two things that I'm great at...

6
00:00:08,220 --> 00:00:09,930
Show choir and destroying the competition.

7
00:00:09,950 --> 00:00:10,850
<i>The New Directions!</i>
<i>Should hire him.</i>

8
00:00:10,890 --> 00:00:13,210
<i>A.) They really want to win</i>
<i>and B.) He's super-handsome.</i>

9
00:00:13,250 --> 00:00:15,260
<i>Terri's back, too,</i>
<i>and Sue wants the Honey Badger</i>

10
00:00:15,260 --> 00:00:15,280
<i>to take out the Glee Club</i> <i>Terri's back,
too,</i> <i>and Sue wants the Honey Badger</i>

11
00:00:15,280 --> 00:00:15,910
<i>to take out the Glee Club</i>

12
00:00:15,960 --> 00:00:17,230
<i>before they can get</i>
<i>to New York.</i>

13
00:00:17,250 --> 00:00:19,060
<i>And that's what</i>
<i>you missed on</i> Glee.

15
00:00:20,260 --> 00:00:22,080
New Directions!,
I would like to introduce you

16
00:00:22,130 --> 00:00:24,270
to our new show choir consultant...

17
00:00:24,350 --> 00:00:26,970
Jessie St. James.

18
00:00:27,050 --> 00:00:29,220
I don't trust this guy.

19
00:00:29,270 --> 00:00:30,690
How do we know he's not
just going to trick us

20
00:00:30,760 --> 00:00:32,560
into doing something stupid,
so his Alma mater wins?

21
00:00:32,610 --> 00:00:33,980
I don't think I need to do much tricking

22
00:00:34,060 --> 00:00:35,280
to get you to do something stupid, Finn.

23
00:00:35,360 --> 00:00:37,260
Guys, Jessie is just a consultant.

24
00:00:37,310 --> 00:00:39,310
I still make all the calls.

25
00:00:39,400 --> 00:00:41,680
Now, I have all the confidence
in the world in you guys.

26
00:00:41,750 --> 00:00:43,920
I just think we could use
all the help we can get.

27
00:00:43,990 --> 00:00:46,050
Because...

28
00:00:46,120 --> 00:00:47,290
This is it.

29
00:00:47,360 --> 00:00:49,060
We've been working so hard for two years

30
00:00:49,120 --> 00:00:51,580
for this moment, and that
moment is finally here.

31
00:00:51,630 --> 00:00:53,530
Now, I was talking with
Jessie, and he agreed

32
00:00:53,600 --> 00:00:55,300
that we should continue
with our successful trend

33
00:00:55,360 --> 00:00:57,400
of doing original songs
for the competition.

34
00:00:57,470 --> 00:00:59,580
I was thinking of doing one group number

35
00:00:59,640 --> 00:01:01,720
and one duet.
Rachel and I should sing a duet.

36
00:01:01,790 --> 00:01:03,440
We killed it last year
at Regionals with "Faithfully."

37
00:01:03,510 --> 00:01:05,770
Yeah, killed us...
we lost.

38
00:01:05,840 --> 00:01:07,020
May I?
Uh, yeah.

39
00:01:07,090 --> 00:01:09,590
I agree that Rachel should sing lead,

40
00:01:09,660 --> 00:01:12,010
but Finn, I think it's best
if you sit this one out.

41
00:01:12,100 --> 00:01:14,600
Fact is, most of the other guys
in here are better singers,

42
00:01:14,650 --> 00:01:17,540
and Mike Chang, who can't
even sing, can at least dance.

43
00:01:17,600 --> 00:01:20,100
You kind of sing and dance
like a zombie who has to poop.

44
00:01:20,160 --> 00:01:21,270
You-you see? You see
what I'm talking about?

45
00:01:21,320 --> 00:01:22,670
The guy's a jerk!

46
00:01:22,740 --> 00:01:25,010
Jessie, maybe you could, uh,
be a little bit gentler

47
00:01:25,080 --> 00:01:26,490
with your advice.
Gentle?

48
00:01:26,560 --> 00:01:28,200
Yes.
I'm sorry.

49
00:01:28,260 --> 00:01:29,650
I didn't realize that we were training

50
00:01:29,720 --> 00:01:31,050
for the "good try" ribbon at Nationals.

51
00:01:31,120 --> 00:01:33,450
I thought we were in it
to win the whole damn thing.

52
00:01:33,520 --> 00:01:34,890
And there's only one way we can do that.

53
00:01:34,950 --> 00:01:36,220
Poison darts?

54
00:01:36,290 --> 00:01:37,890
The Vocal Adrenaline strategy is simple...

55
00:01:37,960 --> 00:01:39,960
Identify your best performer

56
00:01:40,030 --> 00:01:42,330
and build the entire performance
around them.

57
00:01:42,390 --> 00:01:44,060
So what does everyone else do?

58
00:01:44,130 --> 00:01:45,400
And who's our star performer?

59
00:01:46,850 --> 00:01:48,470
We're going to have auditions to find out.

60
00:01:48,520 --> 00:01:50,500
I'm going to post
a sign-up sheet

61
00:01:50,570 --> 00:01:51,850
later this afternoon.
Mr. Shue,

62
00:01:51,940 --> 00:01:53,940
don't you think this
is kind of not our style?

63
00:01:54,010 --> 00:01:56,620
Normally, I'd agree with you,
Finn, but this is the big time.

64
00:01:56,690 --> 00:01:57,890
I think we should listen to Jessie.

65
00:02:05,480 --> 00:02:07,350
I just don't know what
you're so angry about.

66
00:02:07,400 --> 00:02:09,640
Honey Badger, I am lactating with rage!

67
00:02:09,710 --> 00:02:11,110
The Glee Club travels

68
00:02:11,170 --> 00:02:13,690
to New York for Nationals in one week.

69
00:02:13,740 --> 00:02:15,380
They have purchased airline tickets...

70
00:02:15,460 --> 00:02:17,360
Tickets that I would like to screw up.

71
00:02:17,430 --> 00:02:19,880
I asked you to recruit
an expert computer hacker,

72
00:02:19,970 --> 00:02:21,830
and you bring me this.

73
00:02:23,020 --> 00:02:24,670
Do I get a super villain nickname?

74
00:02:24,740 --> 00:02:26,000
Your nickname is Panda Express.

75
00:02:26,070 --> 00:02:28,120
But I'm not Chinese.

76
00:02:28,190 --> 00:02:29,670
Neither is the food at Panda Express.

77
00:02:29,730 --> 00:02:30,990
Look, I'm on top of this.

78
00:02:31,060 --> 00:02:32,460
All the official travel for the school

79
00:02:32,530 --> 00:02:34,060
goes through
the Lima Heights Travel Agency.

80
00:02:34,130 --> 00:02:36,130
All we have to do is e-mail them

81
00:02:36,200 --> 00:02:38,300
through Principal Figgins'
e-mail account.

82
00:02:38,370 --> 00:02:40,270
So what's the hold up?
We don't know his password.

83
00:02:40,350 --> 00:02:41,740
Principal Figgins is an idiot...

84
00:02:41,820 --> 00:02:43,340
Something America is chock full of.

85
00:02:43,410 --> 00:02:47,310
What is the most common password
in America?

86
00:02:47,380 --> 00:02:49,280
One, two, three, four?

87
00:02:51,630 --> 00:02:52,560
We're in.
Outstanding.

88
00:02:54,170 --> 00:02:56,250
The travel agency sent arday

89
00:02:56,340 --> 00:02:58,840
confirming an itinerary
with a layover in Chicago

90
00:02:58,890 --> 00:03:00,420
before heading on to New York.

91
00:03:00,510 --> 00:03:02,340
Compose an e-mail
requesting a flight

92
00:03:02,390 --> 00:03:04,890
that's routed through Tripoli.

93
00:03:04,980 --> 00:03:06,380
Tripoli?
Wait, isn't that in Libya?

94
00:03:06,430 --> 00:03:08,550
The second that plane touches the tarmac,

95
00:03:08,600 --> 00:03:10,380
they'll be swarmed by armed militants.

96
00:03:10,430 --> 00:03:12,770
Wait, are-are we trying
to have the Glee Club killed?

97
00:03:12,850 --> 00:03:14,050
Or kidnapped and killed.

98
00:03:15,550 --> 00:03:18,390
Panda... make it so.

99
00:03:18,440 --> 00:03:20,530
Someone really woke up on the
wrong side of the bed today.

100
00:03:20,580 --> 00:03:22,990
You have no idea.

101
00:03:24,700 --> 00:03:25,900
Mr. Schuester?

102
00:03:25,950 --> 00:03:27,080
Oh, hey, Becky.

103
00:03:27,170 --> 00:03:28,200
Mr. Schuester,
I'm Donna Jackson.

104
00:03:28,250 --> 00:03:29,500
I'm Becky's mom.

105
00:03:29,570 --> 00:03:32,250
I really need to talk to you.

106
00:03:32,340 --> 00:03:34,290
I want to be in Glee Club.

107
00:03:34,360 --> 00:03:37,170
Well, that's great, Becky.
Can you sing?

108
00:03:37,240 --> 00:03:41,510
Not really, but neither can most
of the kids in Glee Club.

109
00:03:41,580 --> 00:03:42,760
But I-I thought
you were having

110
00:03:42,850 --> 00:03:44,050
such a good time on the Cheerios!

111
00:03:44,100 --> 00:03:45,330
Sue kicked her off.

112
00:03:47,250 --> 00:03:49,100
Becky, you're off the Cheerios!

113
00:03:49,190 --> 00:03:51,560
I don't want to see you anymore.
Is that understood?

114
00:03:52,720 --> 00:03:54,690
Did I do something wrong, Coach?

115
00:03:54,760 --> 00:03:56,230
You heard what I said.

116
00:03:56,280 --> 00:03:59,250
I want your pom-poms on my desk
by the end of the day.

117
00:04:01,430 --> 00:04:04,490
I... I-I don't know what to say.

118
00:04:04,570 --> 00:04:06,020
Becky's been totally depressed.

119
00:04:06,090 --> 00:04:07,770
She hasn't been eating...

120
00:04:07,820 --> 00:04:10,630
Can I please be
in Glee Club, Mr. Shue?

121
00:04:10,710 --> 00:04:12,580
I just want to belong.

122
00:04:14,130 --> 00:04:16,830
Becky...

123
00:04:16,920 --> 00:04:18,950
We're a week away from Nationals.

124
00:04:19,000 --> 00:04:22,550
I mean... I mean, the...
the season is almost over.

125
00:04:22,620 --> 00:04:25,510
I'd love for you to join next year.

126
00:04:25,590 --> 00:04:27,780
But for now, I...

127
00:04:27,840 --> 00:04:30,340
I'm afraid there just
isn't a place for you.

128
00:04:30,430 --> 00:04:32,960
We understand.

129
00:04:33,020 --> 00:04:34,380
Thank you for your time.

130
00:04:34,450 --> 00:04:35,730
Yeah.

131
00:04:35,800 --> 00:04:38,400
I hate this school.

132
00:04:39,940 --> 00:04:40,940
You are a terrible person.

133
00:04:40,990 --> 00:04:42,660
Becky was loyal to you, Sue.

134
00:04:42,740 --> 00:04:44,110
Cheerios! Gave her
a sense of purpose,

135
00:04:44,160 --> 00:04:45,910
and then you just rip it away
from her for no reason.

136
00:04:45,980 --> 00:04:47,650
I'm going to be honest with you, Will.

137
00:04:47,700 --> 00:04:48,780
I do have a reason.

138
00:04:48,830 --> 00:04:50,620
She reminds me of my sister.

139
00:04:50,670 --> 00:04:52,080
What does that have to do with anything?

140
00:04:52,150 --> 00:04:53,420
You love your sister.

141
00:04:53,490 --> 00:04:56,290
I do, William, and she died yesterday.

142
00:04:59,310 --> 00:05:00,570
What?

143
00:05:02,440 --> 00:05:04,500
You know, when we were younger,
people always told me

144
00:05:04,550 --> 00:05:06,280
Jean wouldn't live very long.

145
00:05:06,350 --> 00:05:10,020
Used to be that people
with Down's didn't live past 30.

146
00:05:10,100 --> 00:05:14,170
But then she turned 35, and then 40,

147
00:05:14,220 --> 00:05:17,120
and when she turned 50, I thought, somehow,

148
00:05:17,190 --> 00:05:19,510
we might grow old together.

149
00:05:20,950 --> 00:05:22,680
Last week, she got pneumonia.

150
00:05:22,730 --> 00:05:25,530
Doctor said it wasn't bad,
and they put her on antibiotics.

151
00:05:28,950 --> 00:05:31,210
I was there with her.

152
00:05:31,290 --> 00:05:33,660
I wanted to stay the night,

153
00:05:33,710 --> 00:05:36,540
and she told me to go home.

154
00:05:36,630 --> 00:05:38,910
At 2:00 A.M., I got the call

155
00:05:39,000 --> 00:05:41,480
that she had passed away in her sleep.

156
00:05:41,550 --> 00:05:44,500
Sue, I am so sorry.

157
00:05:44,550 --> 00:05:46,800
Could you leave me alone, please?

158
00:05:56,680 --> 00:05:58,550
<i>To think, two short years ago,</i>

159
00:05:58,600 --> 00:06:00,220
<i>I was marching down this hall</i>

160
00:06:00,270 --> 00:06:02,270
<i>to sign up</i>
<i>for Glee Club auditions.</i>

161
00:06:02,350 --> 00:06:04,570
<i>And now, look at me...</i>
<i>look at us.</i>

162
00:06:04,660 --> 00:06:06,240
<i>Nationals.</i>
<i>So much has changed.</i>

163
00:06:06,320 --> 00:06:08,740
<i>I didn't have my bangs,</i>
<i>I'd never had a boyfriend,</i>

164
00:06:08,830 --> 00:06:11,360
<i>and I still had</i>
<i>a tiny layer of baby fat.</i>

165
00:06:11,410 --> 00:06:13,060
<i>But there's one thing that</i>
<i>hasn't changed... my dreams.</i>

166
00:06:13,120 --> 00:06:14,700
<i>I'm still going to be a star,</i>

167
00:06:14,750 --> 00:06:17,070
<i>which means I would kill</i>
<i>to get this solo.</i>

168
00:06:17,120 --> 00:06:19,170
Hey, you haven't signed up
to be the lead vocalist

169
00:06:19,240 --> 00:06:20,500
at Nationals.

170
00:06:20,570 --> 00:06:22,120
Santana, Mercedes and Kurt have.

171
00:06:22,210 --> 00:06:23,670
Hey.

172
00:06:23,740 --> 00:06:25,680
You're the male lead of this group, Finn.

173
00:06:25,740 --> 00:06:28,100
Everybody looks to you for guidance.
I don't need Nationals

174
00:06:28,180 --> 00:06:29,510
to feel better about myself.

175
00:06:29,580 --> 00:06:30,880
We-we-we've...
we've been working

176
00:06:30,930 --> 00:06:32,930
towards this moment for two years now.

177
00:06:33,020 --> 00:06:34,250
And I've been busting my ass to be

178
00:06:34,300 --> 00:06:35,520
a better singer and dancer for two years.

179
00:06:35,590 --> 00:06:37,640
And that Jessie ki
comes in, and he wipes out

180
00:06:37,720 --> 00:06:40,560
all that hard work in ten seconds.

181
00:06:40,610 --> 00:06:42,140
My confidence is shot.

182
00:06:42,230 --> 00:06:43,890
No, you're...
you're really good, Finn.

183
00:06:43,950 --> 00:06:45,400
Okay?
You have to believe me.

184
00:06:45,450 --> 00:06:47,780
I'm... I'm Lima good.

185
00:06:47,870 --> 00:06:49,950
Not New York City good.

186
00:06:50,040 --> 00:06:51,290
R-Rachel, I'm sorry.

187
00:06:51,370 --> 00:06:52,400
I'm not auditioning.

188
00:07:00,280 --> 00:07:02,580
Wow, Will.
That's a lot of vests.

189
00:07:02,660 --> 00:07:05,230
Um, okay...
let's get started.

190
00:07:05,280 --> 00:07:09,370
So I've got one box for going with you,

191
00:07:09,420 --> 00:07:12,740
one box for storage and
one box for giving away.

192
00:07:12,790 --> 00:07:13,950
I'm not going away forever, Emma.

193
00:07:14,040 --> 00:07:15,040
Rehearsals for April's show

194
00:07:15,090 --> 00:07:16,290
start two days after Nationals,

195
00:07:16,370 --> 00:07:18,210
and then opening night
is three weeks later.

196
00:07:18,260 --> 00:07:19,430
I'm guessing we close that night

197
00:07:19,510 --> 00:07:21,910
and then I'm back on a bus,

198
00:07:21,960 --> 00:07:23,380
back to my vests the next day.

199
00:07:23,430 --> 00:07:24,720
Will you stop?
Stop with all that.

200
00:07:24,770 --> 00:07:25,920
You're too afraid to admit

201
00:07:25,970 --> 00:07:26,920
that you're leaving, but you are.

202
00:07:26,970 --> 00:07:27,970
That's why you've asked me

203
00:07:28,050 --> 00:07:29,250
to help pack up your apartment,

204
00:07:29,300 --> 00:07:30,750
and that's why we're going
through your vests.

205
00:07:32,440 --> 00:07:35,260
Do the kids know?
No way.

206
00:07:35,310 --> 00:07:37,360
Can't let anything distract them
from the task at hand.

207
00:07:37,430 --> 00:07:38,860
Besides, by the time they get back

208
00:07:38,930 --> 00:07:41,100
from summer break, I'll be home.

209
00:07:41,150 --> 00:07:43,620
You are so organized.

210
00:07:43,700 --> 00:07:44,540
Thank you.

211
00:07:46,710 --> 00:07:48,210
Whoa.
That one's a keeper.

212
00:07:49,770 --> 00:07:51,830
I wore this the first week of Glee Club.

213
00:07:51,890 --> 00:07:53,460
Mmm. Right.

214
00:07:53,550 --> 00:07:55,280
What about, um...
what about this one?

215
00:07:55,330 --> 00:07:57,470
Will, did you wear this
the first time you tried

216
00:07:57,550 --> 00:07:59,450
the new coffee machine
in the teacher's lounge?

217
00:07:59,500 --> 00:08:02,220
That's the one I was wearing
the first time I met you.

218
00:08:04,720 --> 00:08:06,060
Well, you know what?

219
00:08:06,120 --> 00:08:07,840
You have to let it all go.

220
00:08:11,850 --> 00:08:13,130
You're following your dreams.

221
00:08:27,360 --> 00:08:28,610
Coach Sylvester?

222
00:08:30,950 --> 00:08:32,580
We brought you some flowers and stuff.

223
00:08:34,000 --> 00:08:35,670
We're sorry for your loss.

224
00:08:35,750 --> 00:08:37,540
Put them over there with the rest.

225
00:08:37,620 --> 00:08:38,960
There were more arrangements,

226
00:08:39,010 --> 00:08:40,040
but I had to throw some of them out.

227
00:08:40,110 --> 00:08:41,880
I'm allergic to pansies.

228
00:08:41,960 --> 00:08:44,350
And I don't mean that as a
swipe at either of you.

229
00:08:44,430 --> 00:08:47,330
So... why'd you bother
doing this...

230
00:08:47,380 --> 00:08:50,520
Buying me flowers, comforting me...

231
00:08:50,600 --> 00:08:52,040
After I've actively

232
00:08:52,100 --> 00:08:54,310
made your life a living hell

233
00:08:54,360 --> 00:08:55,890
and enjoyed doing it?

234
00:08:55,970 --> 00:08:57,980
We both know what it's like

235
00:08:58,030 --> 00:08:59,810
to lose someone really close to you.

236
00:08:59,860 --> 00:09:02,530
I sort of do.
My dad died when I was a baby.

237
00:09:02,610 --> 00:09:04,570
Yeah. His dad's dead,
and my mom's dead.

238
00:09:04,650 --> 00:09:07,650
So how do you think you can help me?

239
00:09:07,700 --> 00:09:10,690
Are you here to tell me how to
deal with this? Not at all.

240
00:09:10,740 --> 00:09:12,820
'Cause if I was being honest with you,

241
00:09:12,870 --> 00:09:14,580
Eddie Munster and Herman Munster,

242
00:09:14,660 --> 00:09:17,130
I don't know how to deal with this.

243
00:09:19,360 --> 00:09:21,370
I can't go back into that nursing home

244
00:09:21,420 --> 00:09:23,870
and start sorting through Jean's things.

245
00:09:23,940 --> 00:09:26,370
And I won't plan a funeral.

246
00:09:26,440 --> 00:09:28,510
Have you told your mother yet?

247
00:09:28,560 --> 00:09:29,890
As far as I'm concerned,

248
00:09:29,980 --> 00:09:32,760
she said her good-byes to us
years ago.

249
00:09:32,830 --> 00:09:34,830
If you boys would really like to help me,

250
00:09:34,900 --> 00:09:36,430
you might start by explaining

251
00:09:36,510 --> 00:09:39,100
why it was her time and not mine.

252
00:09:39,180 --> 00:09:41,770
She's the sweetest person I ever met.

253
00:09:41,850 --> 00:09:45,670
And as both of you can attest,
I'm probably the meanest,

254
00:09:45,740 --> 00:09:47,020
so how come I'm the one

255
00:09:47,080 --> 00:09:49,240
still standing here talking to you?

256
00:09:52,760 --> 00:09:54,060
<i>We need to help her.</i>

257
00:09:54,120 --> 00:09:56,170
She's overwhelmed, and...

258
00:09:56,230 --> 00:09:57,370
She needs us to help her.

259
00:09:57,420 --> 00:09:59,090
Seriously?
I'd like to put

260
00:09:59,170 --> 00:10:01,620
the "fun" back in "funeral"
just as much as the next girl,

261
00:10:01,710 --> 00:10:03,090
but why would the Glee Club

262
00:10:03,170 --> 00:10:04,590
help Coach Sylvester plan a service?

263
00:10:04,660 --> 00:10:07,630
We're not doing it for Sue;
We're doing it for her sister.

264
00:10:07,710 --> 00:10:09,230
Jean is just like us, guys.

265
00:10:09,300 --> 00:10:11,420
I mean, she's been an outsider
and an underdog

266
00:10:11,470 --> 00:10:12,930
all of her life.

267
00:10:13,020 --> 00:10:14,450
We, of all people, should celebrate that.

268
00:10:14,520 --> 00:10:16,970
Can I say something?

269
00:10:17,060 --> 00:10:18,810
When someone dies, yes, it's a tragedy,

270
00:10:18,890 --> 00:10:21,060
but it's also a part of life.

271
00:10:21,110 --> 00:10:23,110
And you can't let death
put your life on hold.

272
00:10:23,190 --> 00:10:24,480
Now, I don't mean to be blunt,

273
00:10:24,560 --> 00:10:26,480
but I don't think you should be
planning a funeral

274
00:10:26,550 --> 00:10:27,930
the same week you should be focusing

275
00:10:27,980 --> 00:10:29,430
on the set list for Nationals.

276
00:10:29,480 --> 00:10:31,070
Seriously?

277
00:10:31,120 --> 00:10:32,820
You... you're serious?

278
00:10:32,900 --> 00:10:35,270
Actually, yes, I am.

279
00:10:35,340 --> 00:10:37,490
Do you know what Vocal
Adrenaline is doing right now?

280
00:10:37,580 --> 00:10:40,110
They're in their third week
of 24-hour-a-day rehearsals.

281
00:10:40,160 --> 00:10:41,830
They're on an I.V. drip.

282
00:10:41,910 --> 00:10:43,750
That's how hard they're working.

283
00:10:43,800 --> 00:10:45,830
Do you know what happens
in Vocal Adrenaline

284
00:10:45,920 --> 00:10:48,120
if someone dies during a number?

285
00:10:48,170 --> 00:10:50,300
They use them as a prop,
like <i>Weekend at Bernie's.</i>

286
00:10:50,390 --> 00:10:52,290
No.

287
00:10:52,340 --> 00:10:53,740
Thanks for your input, Jessie, but we're

288
00:10:53,810 --> 00:10:55,410
helping Sue
with the service for her sister.

289
00:10:55,480 --> 00:10:58,930
Rachel, you said I needed
to be more of a leader

290
00:10:58,980 --> 00:11:00,180
of this club...
well, here goes.

291
00:11:00,270 --> 00:11:01,630
I'm making the call.

292
00:11:01,700 --> 00:11:02,520
We're doing this.

293
00:11:13,170 --> 00:11:15,960
Sue, hold on a second.

294
00:11:16,010 --> 00:11:17,510
Finn and Kurt told me that you agreed

295
00:11:17,590 --> 00:11:19,050
to let the Glee Club help out

296
00:11:19,130 --> 00:11:21,260
with your sister's funeral, and I...

297
00:11:21,330 --> 00:11:23,000
I just wanted to say that we're honored,

298
00:11:23,050 --> 00:11:25,390
and it takes a big person
to reach out like that

299
00:11:25,470 --> 00:11:26,770
and ask for help.

300
00:11:26,840 --> 00:11:28,450
I didn't ask for help;
They volunteered.

301
00:11:28,520 --> 00:11:30,310
And I only agreed on the condition that.

302
00:11:30,360 --> 00:11:32,140
Frankenteen and Lady Trousers help me

303
00:11:32,190 --> 00:11:33,980
clean out Jean's room at the nursing home.

304
00:11:34,030 --> 00:11:35,850
They look like they could use the exercise,

305
00:11:35,900 --> 00:11:38,480
and I like the idea of using
your glee club as unpaid labor.

306
00:11:38,530 --> 00:11:40,150
Sue, I know you're going
through a hard time right now.

307
00:11:40,200 --> 00:11:42,370
And despite our differences,
I just, I just want you to know

308
00:11:42,450 --> 00:11:44,490
that you can lean on me if you need to.

309
00:11:44,540 --> 00:11:46,740
Oh, William, I wouldn't dare lean on you.

310
00:11:46,820 --> 00:11:50,210
So much grease in your hair,
I'd probably slide right off.

311
00:11:54,580 --> 00:11:57,330
I'm still not convinced
that this is the best idea.

312
00:11:57,380 --> 00:11:59,250
I don't want any of the kids
to feel like they're losers.

313
00:11:59,340 --> 00:12:00,800
But that's a crucial part of the process.

314
00:12:00,870 --> 00:12:04,760
You see, I took a class at UCLA
in judging for reality TV shows,

315
00:12:04,840 --> 00:12:06,810
so I'm totally ready to give feedback

316
00:12:06,880 --> 00:12:08,390
that's both blistering and unhelpful.

317
00:12:08,480 --> 00:12:10,430
It was a really good class.
I learned a lot.

318
00:12:10,510 --> 00:12:13,000
We're ready for the first contestant.

319
00:12:13,070 --> 00:12:14,770
My name is Santana Lopez,
and I will be singing

320
00:12:14,850 --> 00:12:16,390
Amy Winehouse's "Back to Black."

321
00:12:20,610 --> 00:12:26,280
* He left no time to regret *

322
00:12:26,360 --> 00:12:29,780
* Kept his lips wet *

323
00:12:29,870 --> 00:12:35,940
* With his same old safe bet *

324
00:12:36,010 --> 00:12:41,880
* Me and my head high *

325
00:12:41,930 --> 00:12:45,380
* And my tears dry *

326
00:12:45,430 --> 00:12:51,350
* Get on without my guy *

327
00:12:51,420 --> 00:12:57,390
* And I tread a troubled track *

328
00:12:57,440 --> 00:13:00,860
* My odds are stacked *

329
00:13:00,930 --> 00:13:06,770
* I go back to black *

330
00:13:06,820 --> 00:13:11,270
* We only said good-bye
with words *

331
00:13:11,330 --> 00:13:14,880
* I died a hundred times *

332
00:13:14,950 --> 00:13:18,710
* You go back to her *

333
00:13:18,780 --> 00:13:22,120
* And I go back to... *

334
00:13:25,460 --> 00:13:27,620
* Black *

335
00:13:29,840 --> 00:13:33,300
* Black *

336
00:13:33,350 --> 00:13:37,630
* I go back to *

337
00:13:37,680 --> 00:13:42,100
* I go back to... *

338
00:13:42,160 --> 00:13:46,030
* We only said good-bye
with words *

339
00:13:46,110 --> 00:13:50,080
* I died a hundred times *

340
00:13:50,150 --> 00:13:53,120
* You go back to her *

341
00:13:53,170 --> 00:13:59,710
* And I go back to black. *.

342
00:14:01,710 --> 00:14:02,540
Fantastic, Santana.

343
00:14:04,550 --> 00:14:05,800
Thanks so much for coming in.

344
00:14:08,100 --> 00:14:09,850
Wait, th-that's all
you have to say?

345
00:14:09,870 --> 00:14:12,640
You spent the entire performance
scribbling notes.

346
00:14:14,340 --> 00:14:16,440
Well, if you really must know,
I was simply writing down

347
00:14:16,510 --> 00:14:18,390
that I don't think that
your performance went very deep

348
00:14:18,480 --> 00:14:20,510
into the emotional truth of the song.

349
00:14:20,560 --> 00:14:22,030
Oh, is that so?

350
00:14:22,100 --> 00:14:24,000
Well, I happen to have
some feedback for you.

351
00:14:24,060 --> 00:14:25,980
Thanks, Santana,
th-that's all we'll need.

352
00:14:26,030 --> 00:14:27,730
I'm about to go all Lima Heights.

353
00:14:27,820 --> 00:14:28,630
Th-Thank you.

354
00:14:32,970 --> 00:14:34,610
Hello, I'm Kurt Hummel, and I'll be singing.

355
00:14:34,680 --> 00:14:35,680
"Some People" from <i>Gypsy.</i>

356
00:14:35,740 --> 00:14:36,910
Ah, great selection, Kurt.

357
00:14:36,990 --> 00:14:38,540
Hit it.

358
00:14:44,670 --> 00:14:47,800
* Some people can get a thrill *

359
00:14:47,870 --> 00:14:51,310
* Knitting sweaters and sitting still *

360
00:14:51,370 --> 00:14:55,650
* That's okay for some people *

361
00:14:55,710 --> 00:14:59,400
* Who don't know they're alive *

362
00:14:59,480 --> 00:15:02,890
* Some people can thrive and bloom *

363
00:15:02,940 --> 00:15:06,410
* Living life in the living room *

364
00:15:06,490 --> 00:15:09,610
* That's perfect for some people *

365
00:15:09,690 --> 00:15:13,610
* Of 105 *

366
00:15:13,700 --> 00:15:19,090
* But I at least gotta try *

367
00:15:19,170 --> 00:15:22,540
* When I think of all the sights
that I gotta see *

368
00:15:22,590 --> 00:15:24,340
* And all the places I gotta play *

369
00:15:24,410 --> 00:15:26,130
* All the things that I gotta be at *

370
00:15:26,210 --> 00:15:27,590
* Come on, Papa,
what do you say? *

371
00:15:27,680 --> 00:15:31,300
* Some people can be content *

372
00:15:31,380 --> 00:15:34,970
* Playing bingo and paying rent *

373
00:15:35,050 --> 00:15:38,250
* That's peachy for some people *

374
00:15:38,310 --> 00:15:45,030
* For some humdrum people to be *

375
00:15:45,100 --> 00:15:51,100
* But some people ain't me *

376
00:15:51,150 --> 00:15:54,600
* I had a dream *

377
00:15:54,660 --> 00:15:58,070
* A wonderful dream, Papa *

378
00:16:01,780 --> 00:16:07,780
* Good-bye to blueberry pie *

379
00:16:07,830 --> 00:16:11,290
* Good riddance to
all the socials I had to go to *

380
00:16:11,340 --> 00:16:13,220
* All the lodges I had to play *

381
00:16:13,290 --> 00:16:14,840
* All the Shriners I said hello to *

382
00:16:14,930 --> 00:16:16,630
* Hey, L.A.,
I'm coming your way *

383
00:16:16,680 --> 00:16:20,230
* Some people sit on their butts *

384
00:16:20,300 --> 00:16:23,630
* Got the dream, yeah, but not the guts *

385
00:16:23,680 --> 00:16:27,020
* That's living for some people *

386
00:16:27,100 --> 00:16:34,360
* For some humdrum people, I suppose *

387
00:16:34,440 --> 00:16:37,330
* Well, they can stay and rot *

388
00:16:43,040 --> 00:16:47,760
* But not Rose. *.

389
00:16:49,510 --> 00:16:51,330
All right.
Good job, buddy.

390
00:16:51,380 --> 00:16:52,830
Kurt...

391
00:16:52,900 --> 00:16:55,550
You do know that song was meant
to be sung by a woman, right?

392
00:16:55,630 --> 00:16:57,300
Yes, I'm aware.

393
00:16:57,350 --> 00:16:58,880
And the Glee Club
sort of dealt with that whole

394
00:16:58,970 --> 00:17:00,150
boys singing songs
that are meant for girls.

395
00:17:00,220 --> 00:17:01,690
Oh.
It's kind of old news.

396
00:17:01,770 --> 00:17:03,610
Then you must know that that song was done

397
00:17:03,670 --> 00:17:05,980
to great fanfare by
such Broadway legends as.

398
00:17:06,030 --> 00:17:08,860
Merman, LuPone, Bernadette.

399
00:17:08,950 --> 00:17:10,850
Those are some awfully big heels to fill,

400
00:17:10,910 --> 00:17:13,030
and I'm just not quite sure
that you nailed it.

401
00:17:17,850 --> 00:17:19,540
Usually, at this point,
the reality show would

402
00:17:19,620 --> 00:17:21,910
go to commercial, then we would
take a five minute break

403
00:17:21,990 --> 00:17:23,860
to regroup and get touch-ups
done on our makeup.

404
00:17:23,910 --> 00:17:25,580
So I'm gonna hit the little boys' room.

405
00:17:25,660 --> 00:17:26,800
You're doing a great job, though.

406
00:17:26,860 --> 00:17:28,700
I really think that
you should comment more.

407
00:17:28,770 --> 00:17:30,630
Don't be shy.

408
00:17:34,490 --> 00:17:37,280
Jessie St. James
totally Jessie St. Sucks.

409
00:17:37,360 --> 00:17:39,080
He said I shouldn't be singing girl songs.

410
00:17:39,170 --> 00:17:41,500
I make my living singing girl songs.

411
00:17:41,570 --> 00:17:43,370
I think the winner of four
show choir championships

412
00:17:43,420 --> 00:17:45,400
might be able to give us all
some valuable insight.

413
00:17:45,460 --> 00:17:47,040
We know you're in love with him, Rachel,

414
00:17:47,090 --> 00:17:48,670
but do you have to be so obvious?

415
00:17:48,740 --> 00:17:51,040
Don't use the fact that
Jessie and I once had feelings

416
00:17:51,090 --> 00:17:53,510
for each other as an excuse
for my inevitable win.

417
00:17:53,580 --> 00:17:55,250
Correction:
You had feelings for him,

418
00:17:55,300 --> 00:17:56,630
he made breakfast on your head.

419
00:17:56,720 --> 00:17:58,970
Look, Jessie and I both
appreciate the integrity

420
00:17:59,050 --> 00:18:01,220
of show choir too much
to soil the competition.

421
00:18:01,270 --> 00:18:03,110
He's just gonna vote for whoever is best.

422
00:18:03,190 --> 00:18:04,970
That would be me. You guys
can fight over who's gonna

423
00:18:05,060 --> 00:18:06,860
come in second all you want,
because I kicked that song

424
00:18:06,930 --> 00:18:07,860
square in the balls.

425
00:18:07,930 --> 00:18:09,030
I'm so gonna win this thing.

426
00:18:09,100 --> 00:18:10,280
No bother warming up, Rachel.

427
00:18:10,360 --> 00:18:12,600
I'm about to go out there
and wrap this thing up

428
00:18:12,650 --> 00:18:13,770
like a Christmas present.

429
00:18:26,050 --> 00:18:30,550
* Oh, she may get weary *

430
00:18:30,620 --> 00:18:35,000
* Them young girls...
they do get wearied *

431
00:18:35,090 --> 00:18:42,400
* Wearing that same old shaggy dress *

432
00:18:42,460 --> 00:18:45,130
* Yeah *

433
00:18:45,180 --> 00:18:50,770
* But when she gets weary *

434
00:18:50,820 --> 00:18:58,160
* Try a little tenderness *

435
00:18:58,250 --> 00:19:03,000
* Oh, maybe, Mmm *

436
00:19:05,000 --> 00:19:08,840
* You won't regret it, no *

437
00:19:08,920 --> 00:19:12,170
* Young girls...
they don't forget it *

438
00:19:12,260 --> 00:19:17,160
* Love is their whole happiness *

439
00:19:17,210 --> 00:19:19,720
* Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah *

440
00:19:22,270 --> 00:19:26,310
* But it's all so easy *

441
00:19:26,360 --> 00:19:29,780
* All you got to do is try *

442
00:19:29,840 --> 00:19:32,450
* Try a little tenderness *

443
00:19:32,510 --> 00:19:36,400
* Yeah, all youot to do isman *

444
00:19:36,470 --> 00:19:38,880
* Hold her where you want her *

445
00:19:38,950 --> 00:19:41,570
* Squeeze her, don'tease her *

446
00:19:41,640 --> 00:19:43,470
* Never leave her *

447
00:19:43,560 --> 00:19:46,540
* Get to her, got to try *

448
00:19:46,610 --> 00:19:52,200
* Try a little nderness *

449
00:19:52,270 --> 00:19:56,220
* Oh, yeah *

450
00:19:56,290 --> 00:19:58,870
* Squeeze her, don'tease her *

451
00:19:58,940 --> 00:20:00,620
* Never leave her *

452
00:20:00,720 --> 00:20:04,840
* Try, try, try, yeah *

453
00:20:04,910 --> 00:20:07,860

00:20:13,600 --> 00:20:15,390
* Rub her gentle, man *

461
00:20:25,980 --> 00:20:27,170
WILL oo!

462
00:20:27,220 --> 00:20:28,550
Wow, Mercedes!

463
00:20:28,640 --> 00:20:30,000
Just... wow.

464
00:20:30,050 --> 00:20:31,350
You know, seeing you up there

465
00:20:31,420 --> 00:20:32,860
brought me back to the first time

466
00:20:32,940 --> 00:20:33,920
you auditioned for Glee Club.

467
00:20:33,990 --> 00:20:34,860
You were great back then,

468
00:20:34,940 --> 00:20:37,060
but you were just amazing now.

469
00:20:37,130 --> 00:20:38,640
Thank you for singing that.

470
00:20:38,700 --> 00:20:41,310
And thank you for reminding me
where we started,

471
00:20:41,370 --> 00:20:44,230
and where we're going to now:
Nationals.

472
00:20:44,320 --> 00:20:45,480
Thank you, Mr. Shue.

473
00:20:45,550 --> 00:20:46,900
I couldn't have done it without you.

474
00:20:46,970 --> 00:20:49,740
You're not a star, you're just
a girl who can really sing.

475
00:20:49,820 --> 00:20:50,890
Ex-Excuse me?

476
00:20:50,960 --> 00:20:52,190
I don't think you want this

477
00:20:52,260 --> 00:20:53,390
badly enough, Mercedes.

478
00:20:53,460 --> 00:20:55,230
How many times did you practice that song?

479
00:20:55,300 --> 00:20:56,550
Practice?

480
00:20:56,610 --> 00:20:59,880
No, I feel my material,
and I sing with emotion.

481
00:20:59,970 --> 00:21:02,050
I'm in the moment,
Mr. St. James.

482
00:21:02,120 --> 00:21:03,350
I don't need to practice.

483
00:21:03,420 --> 00:21:05,650
Actually, you do.

484
00:21:05,720 --> 00:21:07,560
And how long did you
work on that choreography?

485
00:21:07,620 --> 00:21:09,840
Oh, wait, there was none.

486
00:21:09,890 --> 00:21:11,810
You're lazy, Mercedes.

487
00:21:11,880 --> 00:21:14,350
Not too lazy to come up there
and let you taste my fist!

488
00:21:14,410 --> 00:21:15,550
Whoever gets this solo

489
00:21:15,620 --> 00:21:17,550
is gonna have to work on it day and night.

490
00:21:17,620 --> 00:21:19,320
Do you think you're ready for that?

491
00:21:19,390 --> 00:21:20,920
I do.
I don't.

492
00:21:28,750 --> 00:21:29,800
I hate him.

493
00:21:31,730 --> 00:21:33,350
Hi. My name is Rachel Berry,

494
00:21:33,420 --> 00:21:35,990
and I'll be singing the most
difficult song I've ever sung.

495
00:21:36,050 --> 00:21:37,250
Great. What song?

496
00:21:37,320 --> 00:21:39,040
Uh, Barbra's closing number

497
00:21:39,110 --> 00:21:41,010
to my favorite movie...
<i>Funny Girl.</i>

498
00:21:41,070 --> 00:21:42,290
Rachel, in your head,

499
00:21:42,380 --> 00:21:44,010
are you singing to anyone in particular?

500
00:21:44,080 --> 00:21:46,410
Not really.

501
00:21:46,480 --> 00:21:49,400
Oh.

502
00:21:52,090 --> 00:21:56,190
* Oh, my man, I love him so *

503
00:21:58,060 --> 00:21:59,810
* He'll never know *

504
00:22:02,100 --> 00:22:05,060
* All my life is just despair *

505
00:22:06,470 --> 00:22:10,120
* But I don't care *

506
00:22:10,190 --> 00:22:15,120
* When he takes me in his arms *

507
00:22:15,190 --> 00:22:18,960
* The world is bright *

508
00:22:21,060 --> 00:22:24,000
* All right *

509
00:22:27,220 --> 00:22:31,760
* What's the difference if I say *

510
00:22:31,810 --> 00:22:34,230
* I'll go away *

511
00:22:37,260 --> 00:22:40,480
* When I know I'll come back *

512
00:22:40,570 --> 00:22:44,490
* On my knee someday? *

513
00:22:44,550 --> 00:22:48,340
* For whatever my man is *

514
00:22:48,410 --> 00:22:51,160
* I am his *

515
00:22:51,230 --> 00:22:57,050
* Forevermore *

516
00:22:57,120 --> 00:23:02,150
* Oh, my man, I love him so *

517
00:23:02,210 --> 00:23:05,270
* He'll never know *

518
00:23:05,340 --> 00:23:07,980
* All my life is just despair *

519
00:23:08,040 --> 00:23:11,550
* But I don't care *

520
00:23:11,630 --> 00:23:15,680
* When he takes me in his arms *

521
00:23:15,770 --> 00:23:19,510
* The world is bright *

522
00:23:19,570 --> 00:23:25,190
* All right *

523
00:23:25,280 --> 00:23:28,880
* What's the difference if I say *

524
00:23:28,930 --> 00:23:31,600
* I'll go away *

525
00:23:31,690 --> 00:23:33,890
* When I know I'll come back *

526
00:23:33,940 --> 00:23:38,490
* On my knee someday? *

527
00:23:38,560 --> 00:23:42,780
* For whatever my man is *

528
00:23:42,860 --> 00:23:45,660
* I am his *

529
00:23:45,730 --> 00:23:53,540
* Forevermore. *.

530
00:24:06,140 --> 00:24:08,920
She may be difficult,
but boy, can she sing.

531
00:24:08,970 --> 00:24:10,770
Bravo!

532
00:24:11,920 --> 00:24:12,760
I have to be honest.

533
00:24:14,740 --> 00:24:16,060
That was brilliant.

534
00:24:16,110 --> 00:24:18,580
I have nothing but the tip of my hat.

535
00:24:18,650 --> 00:24:20,170
Garbage. This whole
thing is rigged.

536
00:24:20,230 --> 00:24:22,820
Hold on, Santana.
Like I said before, I make

537
00:24:22,900 --> 00:24:23,900
the final call here.
Well, then, make it.

538
00:24:25,770 --> 00:24:27,540
Out of respect to you all,

539
00:24:27,610 --> 00:24:29,460
I'm going to take a couple days

540
00:24:29,540 --> 00:24:30,710
and consider all the results.

541
00:24:30,780 --> 00:24:33,450
Now, I will let you all know by Friday.

542
00:24:33,500 --> 00:24:35,130
Great job, everyone.

543
00:24:39,470 --> 00:24:42,290
We sorted Jean's stuff into piles.

544
00:24:42,340 --> 00:24:44,470
Over there are some old
magazines and newspapers

545
00:24:44,560 --> 00:24:45,670
that you can just toss out.
And this is stuff

546
00:24:45,760 --> 00:24:47,480
you're definitely going to want to keep.

547
00:24:47,560 --> 00:24:49,090
Uh, photos and stuffed animals.

548
00:24:49,150 --> 00:24:50,400
And this third pile is stuff

549
00:24:50,460 --> 00:24:52,260
that we don't really know what to do with.

550
00:24:52,320 --> 00:24:53,470
Um...
Pom-pom.

551
00:24:53,520 --> 00:24:55,800
Toss it.
It's not worth anything.

552
00:24:55,850 --> 00:24:57,320
Are you sure?

553
00:24:57,400 --> 00:24:58,900
<i>Willy Wonka</i>
<i>and the Chocolate Factory.</i>

554
00:24:58,970 --> 00:25:00,320
Oh, I love that movie.

555
00:25:00,410 --> 00:25:02,440
Then, you can take it.
It's probably worn out.

556
00:25:02,490 --> 00:25:04,610
She watched it at least three times a week.

557
00:25:07,830 --> 00:25:08,950
Just toss it all out.

558
00:25:09,000 --> 00:25:10,200
What?

559
00:25:10,280 --> 00:25:12,370
You heard me. It's all junk.

560
00:25:12,450 --> 00:25:14,540
I'll take the stuffed animal.

561
00:25:14,620 --> 00:25:17,760
Jean's had this since she was six.

562
00:25:17,820 --> 00:25:20,040
Everything else, just toss
it out; I don't need it.

563
00:25:20,130 --> 00:25:21,460
But there are a lot of memories here.

564
00:25:21,510 --> 00:25:23,460
You know, I'm not short
on memories of my sister, so...

565
00:25:23,510 --> 00:25:25,210
I know what it's like

566
00:25:25,300 --> 00:25:26,880
to lose someone.

567
00:25:26,970 --> 00:25:28,770
When someone dies, it hurts.

568
00:25:28,840 --> 00:25:30,800
Very astute, Porcelain.

569
00:25:30,850 --> 00:25:33,970
That's a little nugget of wisdom
I'd really like to jot down.

570
00:25:34,020 --> 00:25:35,440
Coach Sylvester, we're just trying to help.

571
00:25:35,510 --> 00:25:37,180
You know what, Cottage Cheese?
You're not helping.

572
00:25:37,230 --> 00:25:38,560
You're actually making things worse.

573
00:25:38,630 --> 00:25:41,230
So do me a favor and take
all this stuff to the Dumpster

574
00:25:41,310 --> 00:25:43,320
on your way to the rehearsal
for whatever treacly ballad

575
00:25:43,370 --> 00:25:45,230
you're planning on using
to ruin my sister's funeral.

576
00:25:45,320 --> 00:25:47,120
Why did you agree to this, then?

577
00:25:47,190 --> 00:25:48,850
If you hate us so much, then why

578
00:25:48,910 --> 00:25:50,460
are you letting the Glee Club
plan the service?

579
00:25:50,520 --> 00:25:52,190
I was afraid no one would come.

580
00:25:53,910 --> 00:25:56,630
Jean didn't know a lot of people.

581
00:25:56,700 --> 00:25:58,660
I figured, with the Glee Club there,

582
00:25:58,720 --> 00:26:01,200
at least she'd have a full house.

583
00:26:17,540 --> 00:26:19,290
Hey, Sue.

584
00:26:19,370 --> 00:26:21,090
You look nice.

585
00:26:21,180 --> 00:26:22,740
Thank you for coming.

586
00:26:22,790 --> 00:26:24,290
Jean always stood up for you

587
00:26:24,380 --> 00:26:26,750
when I told her stories about
how evil your hair was.

588
00:26:29,020 --> 00:26:31,350
Did anyone come?

589
00:26:31,420 --> 00:26:32,950
It's a full house, actually.

590
00:26:33,020 --> 00:26:34,610
Workers from the home,

591
00:26:34,690 --> 00:26:36,610
other residents, their families.

592
00:26:36,690 --> 00:26:38,730
Your sister touched a lot of people.

593
00:27:03,330 --> 00:27:05,140
What do you think, Coach Sylvester?

594
00:27:05,220 --> 00:27:06,970
You told us that <i>Willy Wonka</i>

595
00:27:07,060 --> 00:27:08,890
was Jean's favorite movie.

596
00:27:08,960 --> 00:27:12,480
The way you described Jean
made her sound so special,

597
00:27:12,560 --> 00:27:15,950
so we wanted her funeral
to be special, also.

598
00:27:16,010 --> 00:27:17,150
Something to capture and express

599
00:27:17,230 --> 00:27:18,650
the Joy of her life,

600
00:27:18,730 --> 00:27:20,820
rather than the sadness of her death.

601
00:27:20,890 --> 00:27:23,100
It's lovely.

602
00:27:23,150 --> 00:27:24,570
Let's sit.

603
00:27:28,930 --> 00:27:31,560
Welcome to the most unusual funeral

604
00:27:31,630 --> 00:27:33,160
that I have ever attended.

605
00:27:33,250 --> 00:27:37,420
Which makes sense, because Jean
was the most unusual person

606
00:27:37,490 --> 00:27:40,290
that I ever had the pleasure
to spend every Sunday

607
00:27:40,360 --> 00:27:41,960
for the last 30 years with.

608
00:27:42,020 --> 00:27:47,540
I think that Jean's sister Sue
would like to say a few words.

609
00:28:05,360 --> 00:28:07,110
I miss my sister.

610
00:28:09,230 --> 00:28:11,950
Every night, at 10:00 or so,

611
00:28:12,020 --> 00:28:14,570
she used to call me on the phone,

612
00:28:14,660 --> 00:28:19,540
and when I asked her why...

613
00:28:19,630 --> 00:28:24,500
She'd tell me that her body told her...

614
00:28:24,550 --> 00:28:27,530
She wanted to hear my voice.

615
00:28:36,540 --> 00:28:37,890
Hey...

616
00:28:37,980 --> 00:28:39,730
I'll read it.

617
00:28:48,070 --> 00:28:49,340
"I miss my sister.

618
00:28:50,690 --> 00:28:52,490
"The smell of her shampoo.

619
00:28:52,560 --> 00:28:54,410
"The way she could always convince me

620
00:28:54,500 --> 00:28:56,110
to read her
another book."

621
00:28:57,900 --> 00:29:00,830
"When you love someone like I loved her,

622
00:29:00,900 --> 00:29:02,720
"they're a part of you.

623
00:29:02,790 --> 00:29:05,190
"It's like you're attached
by this invisible tether,

624
00:29:05,260 --> 00:29:07,040
"and no matter how far away you are,

625
00:29:07,090 --> 00:29:09,580
"you can always feel them.

626
00:29:11,800 --> 00:29:13,600
"And now, every time
I reach for that tether,

627
00:29:13,670 --> 00:29:16,180
"I know there's no one on the other end,

628
00:29:16,250 --> 00:29:18,600
"and I feel like I'm falling
into nothingness.

629
00:29:19,800 --> 00:29:21,360
"Then I remember Jean.

630
00:29:21,420 --> 00:29:24,190
"I remember a life led with no enemies,

631
00:29:24,260 --> 00:29:27,780
"no resentments, no regrets...
and I'm inspired...

632
00:29:27,860 --> 00:29:31,350
"to get up out of bed and go on.

633
00:29:31,420 --> 00:29:33,980
"I miss my sister so much.

634
00:29:34,050 --> 00:29:36,990
"It feels like a piece of me
has been ripped off.

635
00:29:38,490 --> 00:29:42,240
"Just one more time, I want to hold her.

636
00:29:42,290 --> 00:29:45,000
"Ten more seconds...
is that too much to ask?

637
00:29:45,080 --> 00:29:47,910
"For ten more seconds to hold her?

638
00:29:47,970 --> 00:29:51,280
"But I can't

639
00:29:51,340 --> 00:29:54,120
"and I won't,

640
00:29:54,170 --> 00:29:57,060
"and the only thing keeping me

641
00:29:57,120 --> 00:29:59,640
"from being swallowed whole by sadness

642
00:29:59,730 --> 00:30:03,900
"is that Jean would kill me if I did.

643
00:30:03,960 --> 00:30:07,850
"So, for now, I'm just going to miss her.

644
00:30:09,070 --> 00:30:10,300
"I love you, Jeanie.

645
00:30:11,460 --> 00:30:13,270
Rest in peace."

646
00:30:25,200 --> 00:30:27,220
This was Jean's favorite song.

647
00:30:33,680 --> 00:30:36,630
Hold your breath.
Make a wish.

648
00:30:36,680 --> 00:30:37,760
Count to three.

649
00:30:40,070 --> 00:30:43,770
* Come with me *

650
00:30:43,840 --> 00:30:46,670
* And you'll be *

651
00:30:49,060 --> 00:30:51,360
* In a world *

652
00:30:51,450 --> 00:30:56,180
* Of pure imagination *

653
00:30:56,230 --> 00:30:58,870
* Take a look *

654
00:30:58,940 --> 00:31:02,290
* And you'll see *

655
00:31:02,360 --> 00:31:06,790
* Into your imagination *

656
00:31:13,330 --> 00:31:17,020
* We'll begin *

657
00:31:17,090 --> 00:31:19,840
* With a spin *

658
00:31:19,890 --> 00:31:25,350
* Traveling in the world of my creation *

659
00:31:25,400 --> 00:31:27,710
* What we'll see *

660
00:31:27,770 --> 00:31:30,100
* Will defy *

661
00:31:30,180 --> 00:31:36,220
* Explanation *

662
00:31:36,270 --> 00:31:40,780
* If you want to view paradise *

663
00:31:40,860 --> 00:31:45,670
* Simply look around and view it *

664
00:31:45,730 --> 00:31:50,750
* Anything you want to, do it *

665
00:31:50,820 --> 00:31:54,210
* Want to change the world *

666
00:31:54,260 --> 00:31:58,510
* There's nothing to it *

667
00:32:01,350 --> 00:32:05,220
* There is no *

668
00:32:05,270 --> 00:32:08,810
* Life I know *

669
00:32:08,890 --> 00:32:14,310
* To compare with pure imagination *

670
00:32:14,400 --> 00:32:19,620
* Living there, you'll be free *

671
00:32:19,700 --> 00:32:27,120
* If you truly... *

672
00:32:29,430 --> 00:32:39,140
* Wish to be. *.

673
00:32:42,260 --> 00:32:44,090
Thank you.

674
00:32:59,110 --> 00:33:01,310
Sorry.
Long line in the restroom.

675
00:33:01,360 --> 00:33:03,780
Everyone was fixing their mascara.

676
00:33:03,830 --> 00:33:05,660
Mm.

677
00:33:05,750 --> 00:33:07,950
You did such a great job with the funeral.

678
00:33:08,000 --> 00:33:09,500
I'm so proud of you.

679
00:33:11,820 --> 00:33:13,820
Why are you crying?

680
00:33:13,890 --> 00:33:16,120
Because I'm breaking up with you.

681
00:33:17,490 --> 00:33:19,330
Because of Rachel?

682
00:33:20,540 --> 00:33:22,300
'Cause you still love her?

683
00:33:22,350 --> 00:33:24,210
I shouldn't have done this with you.

684
00:33:24,300 --> 00:33:25,880
I thought that I could fix

685
00:33:25,950 --> 00:33:28,940
everything from last year, but I...

686
00:33:29,000 --> 00:33:30,970
I can't.

687
00:33:31,040 --> 00:33:33,020
I just can't, and

688
00:33:33,110 --> 00:33:36,530
that feeling that Sue was
talking about in there of being

689
00:33:36,610 --> 00:33:39,850
tethered to someone...
I... I just...

690
00:33:39,900 --> 00:33:42,200
I don't feel that way about you.

691
00:33:42,280 --> 00:33:44,180
But you do with her?

692
00:33:46,040 --> 00:33:47,950
No.

693
00:33:48,020 --> 00:33:49,740
We're not breaking up.

694
00:33:49,820 --> 00:33:51,630
I can handle your confusion with Rachel

695
00:33:51,690 --> 00:33:53,240
until you get over it.

696
00:33:53,330 --> 00:33:54,580
We're gonna stay together,

697
00:33:54,660 --> 00:33:56,860
and next year,
we'll be prom king and queen...

698
00:33:56,910 --> 00:33:57,910
Just stop it.

699
00:33:59,030 --> 00:34:00,530
Okay? I don't want that life.

700
00:34:02,500 --> 00:34:04,700
Don't you feel anything anymore?

701
00:34:04,770 --> 00:34:06,690
This is real.

702
00:34:06,760 --> 00:34:08,060
This is happening.

703
00:34:14,270 --> 00:34:16,180
Are you happy now?

704
00:34:18,070 --> 00:34:19,740
Is this me feeling enough for you?

705
00:34:19,820 --> 00:34:21,890
Quinn, I'm sorry.
I still love you.

706
00:34:21,940 --> 00:34:23,020
Just don't touch me!

707
00:34:41,610 --> 00:34:42,780
Action.

708
00:34:43,100 --> 00:34:44,380
Well, it was a tough competition,

709
00:34:44,430 --> 00:34:45,110
but here's the dope.

710
00:34:45,150 --> 00:34:47,780
Santana... too mean.
Kurt... too controversial.

711
00:34:47,800 --> 00:34:50,110
Mercedes... I said it twice,
and I'll say it again.

712
00:34:50,130 --> 00:34:52,610
Lazy B-O-N-E-S.

713
00:34:52,670 --> 00:34:54,000
Rachel is the clear winner.

714
00:34:54,030 --> 00:34:56,530
I'm really not comfortable
having this conversation taped.

715
00:34:56,600 --> 00:34:59,120
Well, I can't practice reality
show judging without a camera.

716
00:34:59,200 --> 00:35:00,700
It's like practicing skiing without skis.

717
00:35:00,770 --> 00:35:02,070
I've totally done that.

718
00:35:02,120 --> 00:35:04,040
Okay, Brittany, can you
just turn that thing off?

719
00:35:04,110 --> 00:35:06,240
Just the off switch... right...
right over there. Just...

720
00:35:06,290 --> 00:35:07,440
Yeah, I know how
to turn it off. Thanks.

721
00:35:07,500 --> 00:35:09,710
Okay. It's cool.

722
00:35:09,780 --> 00:35:11,620
Jessie, maybe you can come on.

723
00:35:11,670 --> 00:35:13,080
<i>Fondue for Two</i> and judge my Cat.

724
00:35:13,150 --> 00:35:16,000
Rock and roll.
I have to be honest, Jessie.

725
00:35:16,090 --> 00:35:17,390
The more we talk about this,

726
00:35:17,460 --> 00:35:18,640
the more uncomfortable
I feel about all of it.

727
00:35:18,720 --> 00:35:20,060
It just feels like I'm telling

728
00:35:20,120 --> 00:35:21,640
one of my children
that they're my favorite.

729
00:35:21,730 --> 00:35:23,580
Well, that's what my parents
told me in front of my siblings.

730
00:35:23,650 --> 00:35:24,610
Sure, some might say that it led

731
00:35:24,680 --> 00:35:26,430
to my brother's whippet addiction

732
00:35:26,500 --> 00:35:29,130
and my sister's bulimia, but
my parents owed them the truth.

733
00:35:31,140 --> 00:35:34,270
You really think picking Rachel
means we beat Vocal Adrenaline?

734
00:35:34,320 --> 00:35:35,840
It's in the bag.

735
00:35:39,480 --> 00:35:41,610
Coach, can I come in?

736
00:35:41,660 --> 00:35:43,860
Hello, Becky.

737
00:35:43,950 --> 00:35:48,290
I'm turning in my pom-poms
and the megaphone

738
00:35:48,340 --> 00:35:49,820
that you got me.

739
00:35:49,870 --> 00:35:52,340
I'll miss our time together...

740
00:35:52,420 --> 00:35:54,660
I'm gonna stop you right there, Becky.

741
00:35:54,710 --> 00:35:57,260
Have you ever heard of menopause?

742
00:35:57,330 --> 00:36:00,100
Well, I fired you in a hormonal fury

743
00:36:00,160 --> 00:36:03,680
I like to call womb rage, and I apologize.

744
00:36:03,770 --> 00:36:06,100
Now I'd like you to
pick up those pom-poms

745
00:36:06,170 --> 00:36:07,350
and that megaphone.

746
00:36:07,440 --> 00:36:08,940
You know why?

747
00:36:09,010 --> 00:36:11,480
Next year, you're Captain of the Cheerios!

748
00:36:11,530 --> 00:36:13,390
Oh, my gosh, thanks, Coach!

749
00:36:14,360 --> 00:36:15,610
Got to call my mom!

750
00:36:15,680 --> 00:36:17,530
Uh, hold it right there.

751
00:36:17,620 --> 00:36:19,530
I'm not finished.

752
00:36:19,620 --> 00:36:21,150
I want you to give me a hug.

753
00:36:22,900 --> 00:36:24,740
Come here.

754
00:36:38,000 --> 00:36:40,140
That seat taken?

755
00:36:40,200 --> 00:36:42,040
No.

756
00:36:46,260 --> 00:36:48,810
William, I have to say something.

757
00:36:48,880 --> 00:36:50,180
In the history of our relationship,

758
00:36:50,250 --> 00:36:52,830
I've said many things to you,

759
00:36:52,900 --> 00:36:54,970
but there's one thing I've never said.

760
00:36:55,040 --> 00:36:57,220
Good luck.

761
00:36:57,290 --> 00:36:59,320
You know, I spent all this time hating you,

762
00:36:59,390 --> 00:37:00,660
and hating that Glee Club.

763
00:37:00,730 --> 00:37:02,880
I do this thing where I sort of alternate

764
00:37:02,940 --> 00:37:04,860
which one of those kids I hate the most.

765
00:37:04,930 --> 00:37:06,580
Right now, it's the dancing Asian.

766
00:37:06,660 --> 00:37:08,550
But after what you did for my sister,

767
00:37:08,620 --> 00:37:11,840
I just can't do it anymore.

768
00:37:11,900 --> 00:37:15,540
You have something Jean
had that I do not have.

769
00:37:17,010 --> 00:37:19,180
A pure heart.

770
00:37:19,240 --> 00:37:20,710
You're a very good friend, William,

771
00:37:20,780 --> 00:37:22,910
and I have not been that to you.

772
00:37:22,980 --> 00:37:24,130
Yeah, you really haven't.

773
00:37:24,200 --> 00:37:25,850
So, it's time for a change.

774
00:37:25,920 --> 00:37:28,420
Starting today, I will no longer
be going after the Glee Club.

775
00:37:28,470 --> 00:37:31,100
Frankly, I have bigger fish to fry.

776
00:37:31,190 --> 00:37:33,560
I'm running for the United
States House of Representatives.

777
00:37:35,780 --> 00:37:37,110
I'm... I'm sorry.

778
00:37:37,200 --> 00:37:38,460
What-What did you say?

779
00:37:38,530 --> 00:37:40,360
In the last year of her life,

780
00:37:40,430 --> 00:37:42,480
Jean faced ballooning health care costs

781
00:37:42,550 --> 00:37:45,600
and cuts to her disability payments.

782
00:37:45,650 --> 00:37:48,240
Well, the Sue Sylvester
American Liberty Party thinks

783
00:37:48,290 --> 00:37:50,840
that's a load of phooey.

784
00:37:50,910 --> 00:37:52,660
There is one slight problem.

785
00:37:52,740 --> 00:37:56,410
In a fit of pique, I rerouted
the Glee Club's plane to Libya.

786
00:37:56,480 --> 00:37:57,660
Wait... what?!

787
00:37:57,730 --> 00:37:58,830
It took some effort.

788
00:37:58,920 --> 00:38:00,800
It was a long fit of pique.

789
00:38:00,870 --> 00:38:03,340
I had some help... Panda Express
really came through for me.

790
00:38:03,420 --> 00:38:04,860
So we're not going to New York?

791
00:38:04,920 --> 00:38:06,590
I can explain that.

792
00:38:09,480 --> 00:38:10,890
Will, I'm gonna leave you two alone,

793
00:38:10,960 --> 00:38:12,480
as this just became super awkward.

794
00:38:14,020 --> 00:38:15,850
These are first-class tickets
on American Airlines.

795
00:38:15,930 --> 00:38:17,270
How did you afford them?

796
00:38:17,320 --> 00:38:19,150
Well, do you know that if you complain

797
00:38:19,240 --> 00:38:20,850
to the airline about contracting monkey pox

798
00:38:20,940 --> 00:38:22,520
in the bathroom on the plane,

799
00:38:22,610 --> 00:38:24,440
you can get the president of the airline

800
00:38:24,490 --> 00:38:25,910
on the phone within an hour?

801
00:38:25,980 --> 00:38:27,490
But you didn't?
No, of course not.

802
00:38:27,580 --> 00:38:29,360
Have you been on their planes?
They're immaculate.

803
00:38:29,450 --> 00:38:31,750
No, it turns out that one
of the vice presidents

804
00:38:31,820 --> 00:38:33,320
of American Airlines is a big supporter

805
00:38:33,370 --> 00:38:34,530
of the arts or something,

806
00:38:34,620 --> 00:38:36,870
so when I told him
your Glee Club's sob story,

807
00:38:36,950 --> 00:38:38,510
he gladly came up with the tickets

808
00:38:38,590 --> 00:38:40,040
for you guys to make it happen.

809
00:38:40,120 --> 00:38:42,710
This is amazing, Terri.

810
00:38:42,790 --> 00:38:44,710
Wait.

811
00:38:44,800 --> 00:38:46,680
What's the catch?

812
00:38:46,760 --> 00:38:48,430
I'm moving to Miami.

813
00:38:48,500 --> 00:38:50,830
Sheets N' Things is opening
a new branch down there,

814
00:38:50,890 --> 00:38:52,470
and they have asked me to manage it.

815
00:38:52,520 --> 00:38:54,220
Like, full on manager?

816
00:38:54,310 --> 00:38:57,520
The assistant title is officially dropped.

817
00:38:57,610 --> 00:38:59,840
Look, Will, I know that I made your life...

818
00:38:59,890 --> 00:39:03,230
Challenging sometimes, but...

819
00:39:05,480 --> 00:39:07,780
...it was only because
I loved you so much.

820
00:39:07,850 --> 00:39:09,990
I loved you, too.

821
00:39:10,040 --> 00:39:12,020
We just weren't right.

822
00:39:13,490 --> 00:39:14,460
No regrets, though.

823
00:39:14,530 --> 00:39:16,540
No. Not one.

824
00:39:22,220 --> 00:39:24,250
Just try to relax a little bit while

825
00:39:24,340 --> 00:39:25,640
you're down there, okay?

826
00:39:25,700 --> 00:39:26,890
Oh. Yeah.
I mean, you deserve

827
00:39:26,970 --> 00:39:27,670
to enjoy yourself.

828
00:39:27,720 --> 00:39:29,260
Okay.

829
00:39:29,340 --> 00:39:31,210
Okay.

830
00:39:33,340 --> 00:39:35,380
I'll see you around, Will.

831
00:39:40,350 --> 00:39:41,570
Hey.
Hey.

832
00:39:41,650 --> 00:39:43,550
Is everything okay with Terri?

833
00:39:43,600 --> 00:39:45,110
Yeah. Finally.

834
00:39:45,190 --> 00:39:46,690
It is.

835
00:39:46,740 --> 00:39:49,060
Is... Are you wearing
one of my old vests?

836
00:39:49,110 --> 00:39:51,610
Yeah, I didn't have the
heart to throw it away.

837
00:39:53,080 --> 00:39:54,280
Emma, this isn't forever.

838
00:39:54,370 --> 00:39:57,120
I hope it is.

839
00:39:57,190 --> 00:39:59,750
Really, Will, you deserve this.

840
00:39:59,840 --> 00:40:03,160
You've given so much for so long,

841
00:40:03,220 --> 00:40:05,290
and now it's your turn.

842
00:40:05,380 --> 00:40:07,880
But, um, don't be a stranger, okay?

843
00:40:12,380 --> 00:40:14,130
Thank you.

844
00:40:27,930 --> 00:40:28,900
Jessie?

845
00:40:28,950 --> 00:40:30,270
That's sweet.

846
00:40:30,320 --> 00:40:32,100
You remember the masculine
click of my designer boots.

847
00:40:32,150 --> 00:40:33,450
Okay, why did you ask me

848
00:40:33,540 --> 00:40:34,790
to meet you here right
before the list goes up?

849
00:40:34,870 --> 00:40:36,070
Is this good news, or is it bad news?

850
00:40:36,120 --> 00:40:38,210
Rachel, I did wrong by you last year,

851
00:40:38,280 --> 00:40:40,580
and I came back to make that wrong right.

852
00:40:40,630 --> 00:40:42,380
And I came here to tell you

853
00:40:42,450 --> 00:40:44,820
that you're going
to be the featured soloist

854
00:40:44,880 --> 00:40:46,220
at Nationals in New York.

855
00:40:46,280 --> 00:40:47,550
Wait, wait. How do you know?

856
00:40:47,620 --> 00:40:48,720
Did Mr. Schuester tell you?

857
00:40:48,790 --> 00:40:49,970
Let it suffice to say

858
00:40:50,050 --> 00:40:51,620
that I was very involved in the decision.

859
00:40:53,890 --> 00:40:55,460
Oh.

860
00:40:58,510 --> 00:41:00,350
No. I-I... I feel bad.

861
00:41:00,430 --> 00:41:01,970
Everyone else worked so hard.

862
00:41:02,020 --> 00:41:03,850
Now they're just going to hate me.

863
00:41:03,940 --> 00:41:05,820
They sort of already do, and

864
00:41:05,900 --> 00:41:07,350
you know as well as I

865
00:41:07,440 --> 00:41:09,570
that sometimes that's the price of fame.

866
00:41:11,750 --> 00:41:15,370
I used to think that fame was
the only thing that mattered.

867
00:41:15,440 --> 00:41:17,250
And now I realize that there's something

868
00:41:17,310 --> 00:41:18,770
that matters to me more.

869
00:41:18,860 --> 00:41:20,930
What?

870
00:41:20,990 --> 00:41:22,480
You.

871
00:41:30,030 --> 00:41:31,380
Come on.

872
00:41:31,620 --> 00:41:33,570
I think the list is posted.

873
00:41:42,000 --> 00:41:43,380
This doesn't make any sense.

874
00:41:43,470 --> 00:41:44,970
Guys, it was a tough decision,

875
00:41:45,040 --> 00:41:46,300
but it's for the good of the club.

876
00:41:46,370 --> 00:41:47,470
Although this is deeply personal,

877
00:41:47,540 --> 00:41:48,870
try not to take it personally.

878
00:41:48,920 --> 00:41:51,890
Um, you guys might want
to read what the list says.

879
00:41:51,980 --> 00:41:53,310
What? Why?

880
00:41:58,770 --> 00:42:01,150
Oh, Mr. Shue,
thank God you're here

881
00:42:01,220 --> 00:42:02,820
to put these trolls out of their
misery. Can you just announce

882
00:42:02,890 --> 00:42:04,520
my win so that I can get on
with teasing the losers?

883
00:42:04,570 --> 00:42:05,720
I heard your performance, Santana.

884
00:42:05,770 --> 00:42:07,240
This is mine, and you know it.

885
00:42:07,320 --> 00:42:08,890
See, Jessie? This is
the kind of infighting

886
00:42:08,940 --> 00:42:10,830
and "me first" attitudes
that I wanted to avoid.

887
00:42:10,890 --> 00:42:12,660
What you call infighting,
I call motivation.

888
00:42:12,730 --> 00:42:14,500
And this is just the beginning.
Once we get to Nationals,

889
00:42:14,560 --> 00:42:16,620
I'll have them willing to kill
each other for that solo.

890
00:42:16,700 --> 00:42:19,170
No.

891
00:42:19,240 --> 00:42:20,870
I've changed my mind.

892
00:42:20,920 --> 00:42:23,340
We're going back to what got us here...

893
00:42:23,410 --> 00:42:25,570
Original songs sung by the entire club.

894
00:42:25,630 --> 00:42:27,630
We're a team,

895
00:42:27,710 --> 00:42:29,630
and we're best when we work as one.

896
00:42:29,710 --> 00:42:30,550
You're going to lose.

897
00:42:30,600 --> 00:42:32,350
Whatever we do,

898
00:42:32,420 --> 00:42:34,520
we're going to do it together.

899
00:42:34,580 --> 00:42:37,750
Actually, Santana, you sounded pretty good.

900
00:42:37,810 --> 00:42:40,140
Thanks. You guys were all
pretty dope, too.

901
00:42:40,220 --> 00:42:41,720
Even Rachel.

902
00:42:41,780 --> 00:42:43,430
I wish I could sound like you do, Santana.

903
00:42:43,480 --> 00:42:44,810
I mean, how do you get that raspiness?

904
00:42:44,900 --> 00:42:47,110
So nice. I smoke cigars.

905
00:42:47,180 --> 00:42:48,780
All right, guys, time to get to work.

906
00:42:48,870 --> 00:42:50,200
Now, I want two hit songs

907
00:42:50,270 --> 00:42:52,450
by the time the wheels
touch down at JFK. Come on.

908
00:42:55,910 --> 00:42:59,960
Hey. Thanks.
For what?

909
00:43:00,040 --> 00:43:01,880
I know you're hurting right now,

910
00:43:01,950 --> 00:43:04,880
but it's really cool
you didn't quit Glee Club.

911
00:43:04,950 --> 00:43:06,350
If I quit Glee Club, my big plans

912
00:43:06,420 --> 00:43:07,470
for New York would have been ruined.

913
00:43:07,530 --> 00:43:09,120
What plans?
You'll see.

914
