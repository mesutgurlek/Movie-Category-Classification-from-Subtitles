1
00:02:28,114 --> 00:02:31,140
Nair, good news.

2
00:02:31,484 --> 00:02:34,851
Your town tender has come to us

3
00:02:35,054 --> 00:02:41,459
<i>Rs 200 crore contract on a
mere 3 lakhs bid difference</i>

4
00:02:41,661 --> 00:02:46,792
Our Ganesh construction has got it

5
00:03:00,180 --> 00:03:04,879
A Rs 200 crore road contract
and we missed out for a mere 3 lakhs...

6
00:03:05,084 --> 00:03:08,281
to Ganesh constructions

7
00:03:08,955 --> 00:03:15,155
We need that contract,
no matter what it takes

8
00:03:15,361 --> 00:03:17,921
Boss, from this moment you may
think the contract is ours

9
00:03:18,331 --> 00:03:21,027
He should not be allowed
to enter this town

10
00:03:21,267 --> 00:03:24,236
Bash him and get me that contract

11
00:03:43,223 --> 00:03:44,952
Where is your boss?

12
00:03:45,858 --> 00:03:47,325
Who are you all? What do you want?

13
00:03:52,632 --> 00:03:54,998
I am engineer Kumar speaking.

14
00:03:55,201 --> 00:03:59,262
Someone has intercepted our
staff vehicle and are threatening us

15
00:03:59,472 --> 00:04:00,530
Who are they? What do they want?

16
00:04:00,740 --> 00:04:03,334
I don't know who they are
and what they want

17
00:04:04,310 --> 00:04:05,777
Come soon sir!

18
00:04:05,979 --> 00:04:09,813
Where are you now?
- 15 Kms from our place

19
00:04:10,016 --> 00:04:10,812
I'll be right there

20
00:04:16,256 --> 00:04:18,622
Catch them! Don't spare them

21
00:08:02,381 --> 00:08:04,008
Saravanan, you!
Are you alright?

22
00:08:04,217 --> 00:08:05,514
I'm fine

23
00:08:05,718 --> 00:08:08,915
When did you come from U. S?
How did you come here?

24
00:08:09,489 --> 00:08:14,859
I was coming from the airport,
I saw thugs chasing women

25
00:08:15,061 --> 00:08:17,291
How could I ignore that?
So gave them few thrashings

26
00:08:18,431 --> 00:08:20,991
How come you are so trim?

27
00:08:24,003 --> 00:08:28,337
If I am obese it may not look nice.
If you are thin it won't look nice

28
00:08:33,079 --> 00:08:37,607
My company staff. I got a call
saying they had a problem

29
00:08:37,817 --> 00:08:40,877
But you rescued them before I did
- Had he not come in time...?

30
00:08:41,153 --> 00:08:43,485
Now that he's back
it's gonna be great!

31
00:08:44,524 --> 00:08:46,822
Where is your beautiful wife
Ganga Senthilnathan?

32
00:08:47,026 --> 00:08:47,617
She is here

33
00:08:50,763 --> 00:08:53,027
Ganga...? Where is she?
She was right here

34
00:08:57,603 --> 00:08:58,467
Scared me

35
00:08:59,772 --> 00:09:03,765
Last year you introduced her to me
as your love

36
00:09:03,976 --> 00:09:06,342
Wasn't she a reserved type?
So mischievous now?

37
00:09:06,546 --> 00:09:08,912
It's her mischief
that I like

38
00:09:09,815 --> 00:09:12,716
Come, let's go home
- Go on, I'll come in my car

39
00:09:13,319 --> 00:09:16,584
Mother is not happy with our marriage
nor with our Vettayapuram trip

40
00:09:16,789 --> 00:09:17,915
You must reason with her

41
00:09:18,791 --> 00:09:19,951
I'll go and see father

42
00:09:38,811 --> 00:09:43,680
Sir, I am a psychiatrist
only because of you

43
00:09:44,050 --> 00:09:48,987
You brought up this orphan as
your own son. I can never forget that

44
00:09:49,322 --> 00:09:53,554
Though you are not with us
you will always live in our hearts

45
00:10:01,267 --> 00:10:01,961
Mom, greetings

46
00:10:02,835 --> 00:10:06,965
Come Saravanan...
so you find time to visit us?

47
00:10:07,340 --> 00:10:10,332
After your last year visit
you didn't even make a call!

48
00:10:11,510 --> 00:10:13,239
I don't care if you are
a great doctor

49
00:10:13,446 --> 00:10:16,472
Don't worry, I am not going to
leave India for quite sometime

50
00:10:16,749 --> 00:10:19,877
I will make you all happy
and I will also remain happy

51
00:10:20,353 --> 00:10:25,052
You will make all those here happy.
But who will solve my problem?

52
00:10:25,257 --> 00:10:28,317
I will do it, don't worry

53
00:10:28,527 --> 00:10:32,395
How did you say, what I had in mind?

54
00:10:32,598 --> 00:10:34,429
<i>That is his speciality</i>

55
00:10:35,635 --> 00:10:38,866
Looking at your face he would say
what is in your mind.

56
00:10:39,071 --> 00:10:42,404
He is not a mere doctor,
he is also an expert mind reader

57
00:10:42,608 --> 00:10:46,009
How else can he treat
confused psychiatric patients?

58
00:10:46,212 --> 00:10:47,042
Shut up

59
00:10:47,480 --> 00:10:51,712
Not a big deal. There is nothing
that cannot be achieved by practice

60
00:10:52,051 --> 00:10:55,111
What makes you think that the people
there will cause problems for Senthil

61
00:10:55,321 --> 00:11:00,452
in his construction work?
- What do you know?

62
00:11:01,427 --> 00:11:05,955
I wanted to reunite his father's family
by getting him married to his cousin

63
00:11:06,499 --> 00:11:09,935
But if they find out that he had
a love marriage like his father...

64
00:11:10,803 --> 00:11:12,464
they might do anything to this girl

65
00:11:13,072 --> 00:11:14,562
You think it's funny?

66
00:11:15,641 --> 00:11:18,633
None of you know about Akilandeshwari

67
00:11:19,345 --> 00:11:23,213
Even her brothers are frightened of her

68
00:11:23,916 --> 00:11:25,747
She is such a terror

69
00:11:26,686 --> 00:11:30,452
She would surely harm
Ganga and take her revenge

70
00:11:30,656 --> 00:11:33,181
I am not going to stay in their house

71
00:11:33,693 --> 00:11:34,887
Then where?

72
00:11:35,094 --> 00:11:39,497
I have bought the Vettayapuram palace
I am going to stay there

73
00:11:47,440 --> 00:11:49,271
What, mother?
- As a kid...

74
00:11:49,475 --> 00:11:53,411
I heard lots about that palace
That is a dangerous place.

75
00:11:54,280 --> 00:11:57,738
For nearly 50 years
no one came forward to buy that

76
00:11:58,384 --> 00:12:00,079
Are you mad to buy that palace?

77
00:12:00,453 --> 00:12:03,980
Don't worry about Senthil or Ganga.
I will ensure nothing happens to them

78
00:12:04,824 --> 00:12:08,089
I shall leave for Vettayapuram today.
My first task would be...

79
00:12:08,294 --> 00:12:12,355
to meet your relatives and console them.
I'll also check the palace thoroughly

80
00:12:12,631 --> 00:12:15,566
Later I will decide whether these two
should stay there or not

81
00:14:25,030 --> 00:14:26,861
'Akhilandeswari House'

82
00:14:27,032 --> 00:14:29,557
Dear, dear!

83
00:14:29,969 --> 00:14:32,437
Have you ever called me lovingly?

84
00:14:32,638 --> 00:14:36,074
You always alarm me! What is so urgent?
- Look! People and cars!

85
00:14:36,275 --> 00:14:37,640
They are coming here

86
00:14:42,348 --> 00:14:45,749
Come on in, sir.
He is a big textile businessman

87
00:14:45,951 --> 00:14:48,044
They have come to seek
your eldest daughter Priya

88
00:14:48,354 --> 00:14:52,620
My sister Akilandeswari takes
all decisions in this house

89
00:14:53,459 --> 00:14:57,452
Though Priya is our daughter
she was brought up by my sister

90
00:14:58,397 --> 00:15:00,627
I'll come after consulting my sister

91
00:15:01,233 --> 00:15:06,261
<i>Kasturi married my fiance, but now she
has forgotten the 30 year animosity...</i>

92
00:15:06,472 --> 00:15:09,441
<i>and seeks my daughter for her son</i>

93
00:15:09,642 --> 00:15:12,839
<i>So I have decided that he will be
my son-in-law</i>

94
00:15:13,078 --> 00:15:14,841
Okay sister.

95
00:15:20,886 --> 00:15:23,480
Where is that businessman?
- They heard what sister said

96
00:15:23,689 --> 00:15:25,520
All the cars have taken an about turn.
- Is it?

97
00:15:26,058 --> 00:15:30,461
It is 8 years since we are married.
In all those I have not seen...

98
00:15:30,663 --> 00:15:34,292
anybody from your uncle's family
- These families parted ways 30 years ago

99
00:15:34,500 --> 00:15:37,469
This wedding will reunite them.
You'll see all of them

100
00:15:37,670 --> 00:15:40,730
Come soon, come

101
00:16:22,114 --> 00:16:26,346
<i>Oh Lordl
Lord of the seven hillsl</i>

102
00:16:28,921 --> 00:16:33,221
<i>Look at us</i>

103
00:16:42,735 --> 00:16:48,105
<i>Our folk, s hearts are diamonds.
Come on burnish it</i>

104
00:16:56,482 --> 00:17:02,910
<i>When all the powers are harnessed...</i>

105
00:17:03,288 --> 00:17:09,887
<i>this earth would turn a heaven</i>

106
00:17:10,195 --> 00:17:14,393
<i>Oh Lordl Lord of the seven hillsl</i>

107
00:17:17,036 --> 00:17:21,564
<i>Look at us</i>

108
00:17:44,296 --> 00:17:45,695
<i>Think for a while</i>

109
00:17:45,798 --> 00:17:49,256
<i>The tiller would smear legs in mud...</i>

110
00:17:49,468 --> 00:17:51,595
<i>so that we can lay hands on our food</i>

111
00:17:54,640 --> 00:17:57,871
<i>If those who clean the drain...</i>

112
00:17:58,143 --> 00:18:01,112
<i>go on leave for four days,
the town would stink</i>

113
00:18:01,313 --> 00:18:05,044
<i>If we don, t have hairdressers...</i>

114
00:18:05,250 --> 00:18:07,810
<i>will we look handsome?</i>

115
00:18:08,020 --> 00:18:12,013
<i>If there is no one to wash
clothes in river water...</i>

116
00:18:12,257 --> 00:18:14,953
<i>will the dirty linen get brighter?</i>

117
00:18:15,360 --> 00:18:18,625
<i>Which ever job you do,
work is worship</i>

118
00:18:18,831 --> 00:18:20,822
<i>Pattukottai said so in his song</i>

119
00:18:22,434 --> 00:18:28,862
<i>When all the powers are harnessed...</i>

120
00:18:29,274 --> 00:18:35,804
<i>this earth would turn a heaven</i>

121
00:18:36,115 --> 00:18:39,380
<i>Oh Lordl
Lord of the seven hillsl</i>

122
00:18:39,585 --> 00:18:43,544
<i>Look at us</i>

123
00:19:20,559 --> 00:19:23,722
<i>Let people say
anything about you...</i>

124
00:19:23,929 --> 00:19:27,228
<i>just listen through one ear
and push it out through the other</i>

125
00:19:30,802 --> 00:19:34,033
<i>Even if the cloud floats
or the crow flies...</i>

126
00:19:34,239 --> 00:19:36,969
<i>the sky won, t get dirtier</i>

127
00:19:37,176 --> 00:19:43,979
<i>Even if a ball is immersed in water
it would float...</i>

128
00:19:44,183 --> 00:19:51,214
<i>Even if you are sidelined
come on up brother, like a ball</i>

129
00:19:51,423 --> 00:19:54,654
<i>Can the crescent
changing to a full moon...</i>

130
00:19:54,860 --> 00:19:57,090
<i>be prevented by glow worms?</i>

134
00:20:18,450 --> 00:20:22,409

00:20:25,958 --> 00:20:31,260
<i>Our folk, s hearts are diamonds.
Come on burnish it</i>

136
00:20:32,864 --> 00:20:38,097
<i>Our folks hearts are diamonds.
Come on burnish it</i>

137
00:20:38,303 --> 00:20:39,429
<i>Superb</i>

138
00:20:39,638 --> 00:20:46,202
<i>When all the powers are harnessed...</i>

139
00:20:46,511 --> 00:20:53,110
<i>this earth would turn a heaven</i>

140
00:20:55,887 --> 00:21:00,119
We don't know when and
how son-in-law is coming

141
00:21:00,325 --> 00:21:03,055
Who let that bullock cart in?

142
00:21:03,262 --> 00:21:04,490
Who is that?

143
00:21:06,498 --> 00:21:11,197
Stop, stop! I say, stop!

144
00:21:13,605 --> 00:21:16,631
You don't pay heed to
a respectable man!

145
00:21:16,942 --> 00:21:18,967
Don't I look like a man?
- No, no

146
00:21:20,512 --> 00:21:21,843
Who are you?

147
00:21:22,047 --> 00:21:24,481
Why did you bring in a bullock cart?
We are expecting our son-in-law

148
00:21:27,853 --> 00:21:30,378
From Chennai. Kasturi madam's...
- Son-in-law!

149
00:21:33,425 --> 00:21:37,156
We expected you by flight. And here you
come in a bullock cart, like a simpleton

150
00:21:38,096 --> 00:21:40,257
Look, I'm not your son-in-law

151
00:21:40,465 --> 00:21:43,662
Right. Not before the wedding

152
00:21:44,069 --> 00:21:45,764
Are you joking?

153
00:21:47,406 --> 00:21:50,842
I'm not your son-in-law. Well...
- Well, you are here now

154
00:21:51,710 --> 00:21:57,239
Oh, how do I explain?
I'm Senthilnathan's friend Saravanan

155
00:21:57,449 --> 00:22:00,111
Before I could explain over the phone
the line got disconnected

156
00:22:00,485 --> 00:22:07,914
Your mother called us and told us
to expect such excuses from you...

157
00:22:08,126 --> 00:22:14,531
because you would be embarrassed
to stay in our home

158
00:22:14,733 --> 00:22:17,258
My sister has taken Priya to the temple

159
00:22:17,469 --> 00:22:20,700
Son-in-law, stop lying now

160
00:22:21,740 --> 00:22:23,105
Oh! You useless fellow

161
00:22:23,308 --> 00:22:26,243
What are you looking at?
Burn the crackers!

162
00:22:39,024 --> 00:22:39,956
Where is son-in-law?

163
00:22:40,859 --> 00:22:42,588
My wife is also missing!

164
00:22:43,695 --> 00:22:47,324
Excuse me! I am scared of crackers.
- Me too

165
00:22:47,632 --> 00:22:48,963
Where is she?

166
00:22:49,167 --> 00:22:51,727
I feel you are like my sister.
- I also feel...

167
00:22:52,104 --> 00:22:53,571
you are like my brother

168
00:22:54,439 --> 00:22:57,237
What bloody feeling?

169
00:22:59,711 --> 00:23:02,680
She is not the girl
you are going to marry

170
00:23:02,948 --> 00:23:05,439
I have already married her
and she lives with me

171
00:23:07,953 --> 00:23:10,183
It is true we have been married
for 8 years and have no children

172
00:23:10,789 --> 00:23:13,781
So don't shift your feelings
towards him, Swarna

173
00:23:13,992 --> 00:23:17,655
What? You and Swarna don't
have children even after 8 years?

174
00:23:19,331 --> 00:23:23,495
He read my mind!
Good Lord!

175
00:23:25,971 --> 00:23:27,802
Simply gorgeous

176
00:23:28,006 --> 00:23:31,169
Enough. I am telling you once again,
she is my wife

177
00:23:31,410 --> 00:23:35,369
Son-in-law, if you talk to your uncle
he would talk for the whole day

178
00:23:35,580 --> 00:23:36,342
Come here

179
00:23:39,084 --> 00:23:43,817
I burst crackers for him,
but he drops a bomb on me

180
00:23:44,089 --> 00:23:46,114
He is praising her too much.
- I will praise her!

181
00:23:46,825 --> 00:23:50,591
Son-in-law, the bullock cart journey
must've been tiring

182
00:23:50,829 --> 00:23:52,194
Go take a shower and rest

183
00:23:55,000 --> 00:23:58,128
What, what is this?
- Brother, let us not have him here

184
00:23:58,336 --> 00:24:00,600
For what?
- We don't need him here

185
00:24:00,839 --> 00:24:04,297
If you allow him to enter, we may
lose many valuables. Be careful

186
00:24:04,509 --> 00:24:07,307
Don't blabber.
- Am I blabbering?

187
00:24:10,949 --> 00:24:13,816
He is calling me over...
did he hear what I just said?

188
00:24:17,255 --> 00:24:19,985
You don't like me
staying here, isn't it?

189
00:24:22,027 --> 00:24:25,827
On my way here, I asked many people
about Vettayapuram palace

190
00:24:26,031 --> 00:24:27,828
Everyone was scared and
no one was prepared to help me

191
00:24:28,033 --> 00:24:32,663
So?
- Lf you take me to the palace...

192
00:24:33,205 --> 00:24:36,436
I won't stay here, otherwise...
- Otherwise?

193
00:24:39,211 --> 00:24:42,112
I will stay here.
- Oh no! I will take you there

194
00:24:42,314 --> 00:24:44,475
But you should do what you say.
- I will say only what I do

195
00:24:44,683 --> 00:24:48,016
Both are same. Shall we go?
Go inside, go!

196
00:24:49,054 --> 00:24:51,522
Even the gate gives me the creeps

197
00:24:52,557 --> 00:24:55,856
This is the Vettayapuram palace.
Now that you have seen it, let's go

198
00:24:56,061 --> 00:24:58,529
Take off your hands.
- Why? Do you want to ride in?

199
00:24:59,564 --> 00:25:00,758
Come inside.
- Where?

200
00:25:01,233 --> 00:25:03,292
Come on!
- Buddy, I'm not going inside

201
00:25:04,069 --> 00:25:09,871
I won't go inside, I swore to you!
It's not fair to force an elderly person

202
00:25:10,075 --> 00:25:12,873
Had I told you, you wouldn't have come.
That is why I'm forcing you

203
00:25:13,078 --> 00:25:15,706
So informal?
- Right

204
00:25:15,914 --> 00:25:17,882
No good showing respect
to a cowardly old man

205
00:25:18,083 --> 00:25:20,881
I won't go, even if you abuse me!
- Who stays here?

206
00:25:21,086 --> 00:25:22,212
I won't tell.
- Swarna!

207
00:25:22,420 --> 00:25:25,719
A gardener and his grand daughter!
- Really? So why are you so scared?

208
00:25:25,924 --> 00:25:28,722
They don't stay inside palace.
- But we're going in

209
00:25:28,927 --> 00:25:34,058
You may go in! I'll go back home.
- Why is that rope and log hanging there?

210
00:25:34,266 --> 00:25:36,393
Painting work is in process.
- Then, are there painters inside?

211
00:25:36,601 --> 00:25:39,229
Only one guy named Gopal.
He has been painting for a month

212
00:25:39,437 --> 00:25:43,567
A guy staying here alone for a month,
but we both are scared to go in?

213
00:25:44,109 --> 00:25:46,805
But he is from another village.
Had he known he would've fled

214
00:25:52,617 --> 00:25:54,915
It is so dark in here
even in broad daylight

215
00:25:55,120 --> 00:25:59,147
Murugesh, do you know the
history behind this palace?

216
00:25:59,624 --> 00:26:05,824
Does STD mean history?
Inmates of this palace fled 50 years ago

217
00:26:06,131 --> 00:26:10,090
Now some fool has bought it
and is having it painted

218
00:26:10,302 --> 00:26:14,363
They can't hide what is inside
by painting the outside

219
00:26:14,973 --> 00:26:16,941
Let us go now.
- OK, let us go

220
00:26:17,309 --> 00:26:20,938
Not inside but outside.
Look, an elephant is lying dead here

221
00:26:21,146 --> 00:26:23,273
That is a buffalo, Murugesh.
- Buffalo?

222
00:26:23,481 --> 00:26:26,780
What do you think there is inside?
- Ghosts, they say

223
00:26:26,985 --> 00:26:29,112
Fools.
- Evil spirits, they say

224
00:26:29,321 --> 00:26:34,122
Cowards.
- A 30-feet snake, since 30 years!

225
00:26:34,326 --> 00:26:38,626
That is why, that Gopal...
- A snake, really...?

226
00:26:38,830 --> 00:26:42,129
<i>He doesn, t work here beyond 4 p. M</i>

227
00:26:42,334 --> 00:26:47,465
One day he boldly worked after 4 p. M...

228
00:26:47,672 --> 00:26:52,132
And that day, things strangely
started breaking suddenly

229
00:26:52,344 --> 00:26:55,472
Ever since, he leaves the palace
by 4 to 4:30 p. M

230
00:26:55,680 --> 00:26:58,308
Why should a guy with
so much fear work alone?

231
00:26:58,850 --> 00:27:00,977
Groom is missing?
Groom!

232
00:27:06,524 --> 00:27:09,982
He ditched me! Oh God!

233
00:27:10,195 --> 00:27:12,993
He left me alone.
How will I go out?

234
00:27:13,198 --> 00:27:19,899
I've to go 1 k.m. From here.
Gopal, take me along. Where are you?

235
00:27:28,213 --> 00:27:32,843
He came with me,
and ditched me, murderer

236
00:27:40,392 --> 00:27:42,121
A lion!

237
00:28:34,112 --> 00:28:37,570
Brother Murugesh, look at me

238
00:28:37,782 --> 00:28:42,082
Say something... please

239
00:28:42,787 --> 00:28:46,245
Didn't I ask you not to take him there?
Just look at him

240
00:28:46,458 --> 00:28:50,417
He looks like one of those big shots,
frozen with a smile while being arrested

241
00:28:50,628 --> 00:28:51,993
What to do now?

242
00:29:06,644 --> 00:29:11,547
Sister...? Why is there a crowd here?
What happened?

243
00:29:11,816 --> 00:29:14,216
Greetings, I am...
- not the groom

244
00:29:15,320 --> 00:29:17,447
Where is my prospective son-in-law?

245
00:29:18,490 --> 00:29:21,618
When they said, you came by bullock cart...

246
00:29:22,160 --> 00:29:24,788
I knew that you were not my son in law

247
00:29:25,330 --> 00:29:29,960
Because his son wouldn't come like that.
- You said it right

248
00:29:30,168 --> 00:29:35,629
I tried to tell them
I am not the groom...

249
00:29:35,840 --> 00:29:37,239
but they don't believe me

250
00:29:37,509 --> 00:29:39,704
But you've understood it on your own

251
00:29:41,346 --> 00:29:45,043
The groom has decided to buy
'Vettayapuram Palace' in this village

252
00:29:46,518 --> 00:29:50,318
He has sent me for that. I am his friend.
I've been brought up in his house

253
00:29:50,522 --> 00:29:52,319
My name is Saravanan.
- Impossible!

254
00:29:52,524 --> 00:29:56,483
I won't allow him to buy
the 'Vettayapuram Palace'

255
00:29:56,694 --> 00:30:00,824
lt'll be dangerous for him to buy that

256
00:30:01,199 --> 00:30:02,826
For my daughter too,
who will marry him

257
00:30:03,034 --> 00:30:04,934
Well, lady...

258
00:30:05,870 --> 00:30:07,167
I don't know how to say this.

259
00:30:07,705 --> 00:30:09,332
His marrying your daughter...

260
00:30:09,541 --> 00:30:10,838
There he comes

261
00:30:11,876 --> 00:30:13,844
He resembles his dad

262
00:30:18,216 --> 00:30:19,683
You? Son in law?

263
00:30:24,556 --> 00:30:28,515
Priya, come here.
You wanted to see your fiance

264
00:30:28,726 --> 00:30:31,752
He has arrived. Come and see him

265
00:30:37,235 --> 00:30:38,532
Who's that?

266
00:30:39,070 --> 00:30:40,765
She is Ganga

267
00:30:42,073 --> 00:30:43,040
My wife

268
00:30:46,244 --> 00:30:50,374
His mother wanted him
to marry your adopted daughter...

269
00:30:50,582 --> 00:30:54,712
but due to certain circumstances,
Senthil had to marry Ganga

270
00:30:55,086 --> 00:30:58,886
What is this? People from big families
asked for my daughter's hand...

271
00:30:59,090 --> 00:31:01,388
but I didn't agree,
but you have deserted us

272
00:31:01,593 --> 00:31:05,120
Marriages and alliances are decided
by destiny. How can we control it?

273
00:31:05,430 --> 00:31:09,230
What a knowledge at such an young age?

274
00:31:09,601 --> 00:31:12,570
You have Avvaiyar's brain. Shake hand

275
00:31:12,770 --> 00:31:14,067
Let it be

276
00:31:14,272 --> 00:31:17,241
My marriage definitely would have
hurt you

277
00:31:17,442 --> 00:31:22,243
But I've come here only to see you all.
Pardon me

278
00:31:22,947 --> 00:31:24,744
We shall leave now.
- Where?

279
00:31:24,949 --> 00:31:29,249
I've bought 'Vettayapuram Palace'.
We shall be staying there

280
00:31:29,621 --> 00:31:31,418
You mean THAT palace? Please don't

281
00:31:31,623 --> 00:31:34,251
Why?
- I went to see it, and I got a shock

282
00:31:34,459 --> 00:31:36,256
If you buy it,
you'd be inviting trouble

283
00:31:36,461 --> 00:31:38,759
Uncle, you are all elderly,
this is what you believe

284
00:31:38,963 --> 00:31:44,265
Listen to me. Just like my uncle,
you also married an outside girl

285
00:31:44,469 --> 00:31:47,597
However, I won't allow you to stay
in such a dangerous place

286
00:31:47,805 --> 00:31:51,764
Uncle, before coming here
Ganga and I visited that palace

287
00:31:51,976 --> 00:31:54,274
Nothing is scary over there like he said

288
00:31:54,479 --> 00:32:00,111
Don't mistake me, I've been a gardener
in that palace for 40 years

289
00:32:00,318 --> 00:32:04,448
Even I've not gone inside that palace.
Please think and act

290
00:32:04,656 --> 00:32:10,788
I've bought that 50-crore worth
property for 5 crore rupees...

291
00:32:10,995 --> 00:32:11,962
I know that people believe that
it has some problems

292
00:32:12,830 --> 00:32:18,462
But I don't believe it. I want my wife
Ganga to be the owner...

293
00:32:18,670 --> 00:32:21,468
of a palace instead of just a house.
That's why I bought it

294
00:32:21,673 --> 00:32:24,801
In case of any problems, we'll deal
with it. You don't worry

295
00:32:25,009 --> 00:32:26,135
Go stay there

296
00:32:31,015 --> 00:32:33,074
You may go and stay in that house

297
00:32:35,853 --> 00:32:40,756
Why do you stare? I stood against buying
that house. Are you wondering...

298
00:32:41,526 --> 00:32:43,653
why I am asking him to stay there?

299
00:32:44,028 --> 00:32:48,488
Not only them, but all of us
are going to stay there...

300
00:32:48,700 --> 00:32:51,567
until his contract gets over.
- Oh God!

301
00:32:54,205 --> 00:32:58,335
If both of them go there alone and
something happens to them...

302
00:32:58,543 --> 00:33:01,512
his mom will mistake me thinking that
since he didn't marry my daughter...

303
00:33:02,380 --> 00:33:08,012
we had sent him there
despite knowing everything

304
00:33:08,720 --> 00:33:14,852
Hence all of us will go and stay there
until everything is solved

305
00:33:15,059 --> 00:33:18,358
Correct.
- Nice of you. Let's get her blessings

306
00:33:18,563 --> 00:33:20,190
No, Senthil
- Why?

307
00:33:20,398 --> 00:33:21,365
Not now

308
00:33:23,568 --> 00:33:29,598
Complete the contract,
then we all can get her blessings

309
00:33:53,431 --> 00:33:56,059
All these poojas won't be
effective in this palace

310
00:33:56,768 --> 00:33:59,896
I've come along only to see your end

311
00:34:00,438 --> 00:34:03,839
Now that you have come,
just watch what happens

312
00:34:07,779 --> 00:34:12,910
Senthilnathan, we are not staying
just because sister asked us to

313
00:34:13,117 --> 00:34:18,077
I don't want you two to stay alone and
get into trouble, that's why I agreed

314
00:34:18,289 --> 00:34:21,918
We would stay here till the end
only on one condition

315
00:34:22,126 --> 00:34:24,594
Tell me, what is it?
- On no account...

316
00:34:24,796 --> 00:34:27,424
should anyone go to the stairway behind

317
00:34:29,801 --> 00:34:34,204
Specifically no one should go to
the room in the southern corner

318
00:34:35,807 --> 00:34:39,607
You have decided to stay with us with
your family. Won't I do atleast this?

319
00:34:39,811 --> 00:34:42,780
We shall stay away from
that place for sure

320
00:34:43,981 --> 00:34:45,676
Now I am happy

321
00:34:49,320 --> 00:34:51,550
Oh God! What would I do?

322
00:34:51,823 --> 00:34:55,122
Why do they buy trouble
and decorate it nicely?

323
00:34:55,993 --> 00:34:59,793
I shouldn't stay alone in the house.
I should always be with the others

324
00:34:59,997 --> 00:35:01,021
Murugesa!

325
00:35:02,500 --> 00:35:06,561
Such a beautiful name. Why do you
call it in such a scary manner?

326
00:35:08,172 --> 00:35:10,037
Why do you create trouble?
- I have a sore throat

327
00:35:10,508 --> 00:35:13,568
I forgot to ask, what is
your zodiac sign?

328
00:35:14,178 --> 00:35:16,146
Why?
Just tell me

329
00:35:16,848 --> 00:35:20,909
Leo.
- Leo, really?

330
00:35:21,519 --> 00:35:24,147
Only one in a lakh will
have this zodiac sign

331
00:35:25,356 --> 00:35:27,324
You are lucky

332
00:35:29,193 --> 00:35:31,388
Ghosts love that sign!

333
00:35:42,540 --> 00:35:45,168
Does it take so many people
to lift one cot?

334
00:35:45,376 --> 00:35:47,503
This is not any ordinary cot?
It is an antique

335
00:35:47,712 --> 00:35:50,340
Made of Burma teak. It takes
more than 2 people to lift it

336
00:35:50,548 --> 00:35:53,517
Bring your wife and come quickly

337
00:35:53,718 --> 00:35:56,619
We are going to visit the family deity.
It's your dad's temple

338
00:35:56,888 --> 00:36:01,348
In a bullock cart with the groom

339
00:36:01,559 --> 00:36:03,527
Why all of you are
coming in a bullock cart?

340
00:36:03,728 --> 00:36:08,188
Sir is a doctor in the U. S, he likes
to go only in a bullock cart

341
00:36:08,900 --> 00:36:11,869
Mercedes Benz is fine, but
the bullock cart has its own charm

342
00:36:12,069 --> 00:36:14,697
Well said
- Gardener, what are you doing here?

343
00:36:14,906 --> 00:36:18,364
My grand daughter is flying kites
with all the kids

344
00:36:18,576 --> 00:36:20,874
So I am here with her
- Who is she?

345
00:36:21,078 --> 00:36:25,208
That girl in a white sari
with black stripes

346
00:36:30,922 --> 00:36:32,651
I did kite flying at a very young age
- Yes

347
00:36:33,257 --> 00:36:35,555
<i>Are you ready?
- Readyl</i>

348
00:37:04,288 --> 00:37:05,915
<i>Crane, fly fly</i>

349
00:37:06,123 --> 00:37:07,750
<i>Hen fly fly</i>

350
00:37:07,959 --> 00:37:09,426
<i>Myna fly fly</i>

351
00:37:09,627 --> 00:37:11,424
<i>Peacock fly</i>

352
00:37:18,302 --> 00:37:21,760
<i>My Kite, fly away</i>

353
00:37:21,973 --> 00:37:25,033
<i>Fly across the sky</i>

354
00:37:25,309 --> 00:37:28,437
<i>Oh my soull Fly</i>

355
00:37:28,646 --> 00:37:31,774
<i>No bounds fly</i>

356
00:37:31,983 --> 00:37:35,111
<i>This kite leaps and flies,
it will fly splendidly</i>

357
00:37:35,319 --> 00:37:37,787
<i>This is super star, s kitel
Our kite</i>

358
00:38:27,038 --> 00:38:29,666
<i>If you see Goddess Meenakshi...</i>

359
00:38:29,874 --> 00:38:33,503
<i>Pray to do away with money lending
at exhorbitant interest</i>

360
00:38:33,878 --> 00:38:36,506
<i>If you see Sri Renganathan...</i>

361
00:38:36,714 --> 00:38:40,241
<i>Ask Talaicauveri to come often</i>

362
00:38:40,551 --> 00:38:43,850
<i>Don, t know about Yesterday or
tomorrow. But today is present</i>

363
00:38:44,055 --> 00:38:47,183
<i>Fly and dance as you wish</i>

364
00:38:47,391 --> 00:38:50,690
<i>The wind is now favourable to us</i>

365
00:38:50,895 --> 00:38:54,194
<i>Our kite is not a butterfly
but an Eagle</i>

366
00:38:54,398 --> 00:38:57,697
<i>The sharpened kite flying thread...</i>

367
00:38:57,902 --> 00:39:00,029
<i>will duel with anyone</i>

368
00:39:01,906 --> 00:39:04,875
<i>This kite leaps and flies,
it will fly splendidly</i>

369
00:39:05,076 --> 00:39:07,806
<i>This is super star, s kite, our kite</i>

370
00:39:56,961 --> 00:40:03,594
<i>If the ladder is kicked
gratitude becomes meaningless</i>

371
00:40:03,801 --> 00:40:06,770
<i>Nod your head to the wind...</i>

372
00:40:06,971 --> 00:40:09,997
<i>thank the kite flying thread gently</i>

373
00:40:10,307 --> 00:40:13,606
<i>Have not gone to schools,
have not gone to college...</i>

374
00:40:13,811 --> 00:40:17,008
<i>but got degrees</i>

375
00:40:17,314 --> 00:40:20,613
<i>Not even books
teach lot of lessons...</i>

376
00:40:20,818 --> 00:40:24,117
<i>kites teach and kite is a teacher</i>

377
00:40:24,321 --> 00:40:27,620
<i>Who can fence the air?</i>

378
00:40:27,825 --> 00:40:29,793
<i>Let us fly like kites</i>

379
00:40:45,843 --> 00:40:47,310
<i>Crane fly fly</i>

380
00:40:47,511 --> 00:40:48,978
<i>Hen fly fly</i>

381
00:40:49,180 --> 00:40:50,647
<i>Myna fly fly</i>

382
00:40:50,848 --> 00:40:52,645
<i>Peacock fly</i>

383
00:40:52,850 --> 00:40:56,149
<i>Oh My kite fly</i>

384
00:40:56,353 --> 00:40:59,322
<i>Fly sky high</i>

385
00:40:59,523 --> 00:41:04,324
<i>Fly across sky no bounds</i>

386
00:41:04,528 --> 00:41:06,155
<i>Fly fly</i>

387
00:41:06,363 --> 00:41:09,332
<i>This kite leaps and flies,
it will fly splendidly</i>

388
00:41:09,533 --> 00:41:12,331
<i>This is super star, s kite, our kite</i>

389
00:41:22,213 --> 00:41:25,011
Priest, this is my nephew Senthilnathan

390
00:41:25,216 --> 00:41:27,514
He has bought the Vettayapuram palace

391
00:41:28,385 --> 00:41:32,287
Everyone is scared when a mention
is made about the palace

392
00:41:32,556 --> 00:41:35,525
What is there? What happened?

393
00:41:35,726 --> 00:41:39,423
About 100 to 150 years ago...

394
00:41:40,064 --> 00:41:43,363
<i>King Vettayan lived in that palace</i>

395
00:41:43,567 --> 00:41:48,095
<i>He used to make a peculiar noise
when he arrives</i>

396
00:41:48,572 --> 00:41:53,703
<i>He would do anything to attain his goal.
He was such a brutal man</i>

397
00:41:54,245 --> 00:41:59,706
<i>Once when he had gone to
Vijayanagaram in Andhra...</i>

398
00:42:00,084 --> 00:42:04,384
<i>he met a dancer called Chandramukhi</i>

399
00:42:04,588 --> 00:42:10,049
<i>He was lured by her beauty and
wanted to make her his mistress</i>

400
00:42:10,928 --> 00:42:13,556
<i>But Chandramukhi did not agree</i>

401
00:42:13,764 --> 00:42:19,066
Because she already loved
a dancer called Gunasekaran

402
00:42:19,270 --> 00:42:25,402
Even after knowing that, the king
abducted her against her wishes

403
00:42:25,609 --> 00:42:28,737
Chandramukhi without the knowledge
of the king...

404
00:42:28,946 --> 00:42:36,250
made Gunasekaran stay in
a nearby house and met him stealthily

405
00:42:36,453 --> 00:42:40,583
The King came to know about this.
On a Durgastami day...

406
00:42:40,958 --> 00:42:47,921
the king killed Gunasekaran
right in front of her...

407
00:42:48,132 --> 00:42:51,101
in the banquet hall of the palace,
and he burnt her alive

408
00:42:51,302 --> 00:42:54,760
Chandramukhi had an untimely death
not doing anything wrong

409
00:42:54,972 --> 00:42:57,600
Her soul wanted to avenge the king

410
00:42:57,808 --> 00:43:02,268
The king knew about this and brought
all sorcerors from all over the country...

411
00:43:02,479 --> 00:43:08,111
and conducted prayers and sealed
Chandramukhi's ashes in a pot

412
00:43:08,319 --> 00:43:12,119
He kept the pot in a room at the southern
corner of the palace and locked it

413
00:43:12,323 --> 00:43:17,784
After some years the king also died.
But Chandramukhi's soul...

414
00:43:17,995 --> 00:43:22,125
is still waiting in that room
to avenge the king

415
00:43:22,333 --> 00:43:28,966
It is said that there is a
king cobra there too

416
00:43:29,340 --> 00:43:34,300
<i>Nobody knows how much of this
is true and how much is not</i>

417
00:44:12,883 --> 00:44:16,250
12 o'clock? This is the time
at which the ghosts come out

418
00:44:17,721 --> 00:44:20,189
They have all left me alone.
Is it a bedroom?

419
00:44:20,391 --> 00:44:23,360
It looks like a big ground.
I accepted not knowing this

420
00:44:24,228 --> 00:44:27,026
Now my heart throbs while I sleep here

421
00:44:29,733 --> 00:44:30,529
Who is that?

422
00:44:31,235 --> 00:44:32,031
Oh God

423
00:44:33,737 --> 00:44:35,864
I didn't do it, I didn't do it

424
00:44:36,073 --> 00:44:39,702
It is me, Murugesan

425
00:44:39,910 --> 00:44:44,870
Why did you come at this time?
- Could not bear my wife's snores

426
00:44:45,082 --> 00:44:48,051
At nights she walks like a devil,
she lies down like a ghost

427
00:44:48,252 --> 00:44:50,379
From the day I heard the
priest's story I have lost my sleep

428
00:44:50,587 --> 00:44:52,612
Let us hug together and sleep here

429
00:44:55,092 --> 00:44:58,960
No.
- Expected. Are you not a doctor?

430
00:44:59,763 --> 00:45:01,890
Please clarify my doubts.
- What Murughesan?

431
00:45:02,099 --> 00:45:04,727
Do ghosts exist?

432
00:45:06,437 --> 00:45:08,234
Have they ever seen one?

433
00:45:08,939 --> 00:45:11,407
Should I believe it or not?
I want to know this

434
00:45:15,279 --> 00:45:18,908
Why do you turn so often?
It seems the priest is better than you

435
00:45:19,116 --> 00:45:23,177
Do ghosts exist? Is there any
indication of a ghost coming?

436
00:45:23,454 --> 00:45:28,084
There are typical indications.
- Like?

437
00:45:28,292 --> 00:45:30,760
A dog howls at a distance

438
00:45:37,134 --> 00:45:40,262
Really, I can hear the sound there

439
00:45:40,471 --> 00:45:42,439
Did I ask?
- No

440
00:45:43,640 --> 00:45:48,600
The breeze blows wild,
the trees sway...

441
00:45:48,979 --> 00:45:50,446
the windows rattle...

442
00:45:54,485 --> 00:45:57,113
I can hear this sound there

443
00:45:57,488 --> 00:45:58,955
Did I ask?
- No

444
00:45:59,156 --> 00:46:02,956
A faint smell of jasmine...

445
00:46:03,160 --> 00:46:04,787
Jasmine!
- Why are you shouting?

446
00:46:04,995 --> 00:46:08,453
Ok, the wind will carry jasmine smell

447
00:46:09,500 --> 00:46:13,800
Yes I can smell the jamine fragrance

448
00:46:14,004 --> 00:46:15,130
Did I ask?
- No

449
00:46:15,339 --> 00:46:18,638
Just hear the story, no cross questions

450
00:46:19,009 --> 00:46:22,638
If you do... what is this?
- Adam's apple

451
00:46:22,846 --> 00:46:24,245
I will pluck it out

452
00:46:25,682 --> 00:46:26,580
Then...

453
00:46:27,851 --> 00:46:28,977
What?

454
00:46:29,853 --> 00:46:32,151
What?
- Anklet

455
00:46:35,526 --> 00:46:38,495
Oh God I hear the anklet sound also

456
00:46:38,695 --> 00:46:40,822
Did I ask?
- No

457
00:46:41,198 --> 00:46:47,262
Then a smoke like image in
white attire comes up

458
00:46:49,373 --> 00:46:54,333
It's showing up!

459
00:46:54,545 --> 00:46:56,740
Where?
- There

460
00:46:58,215 --> 00:47:06,020
Why do you laugh like a woman?
- Not I. The ghost is laughing

461
00:47:06,223 --> 00:47:08,350
Where?
- There

462
00:47:17,234 --> 00:47:19,293
It's gone

463
00:47:20,571 --> 00:47:24,029
You have mistaken my grandpa's dhoti
swinging in the wind for a ghost

464
00:47:24,241 --> 00:47:26,766
Have you not learnt anything?
- Me scared?

465
00:47:27,578 --> 00:47:28,875
Me?
- Yes

466
00:47:30,247 --> 00:47:33,876
Murugesan and I were rehearsing
for a drama. What is you name?

467
00:47:34,084 --> 00:47:35,711
Why?
- Just to know

468
00:47:35,919 --> 00:47:37,386
Durga.
- Goodness me

469
00:47:37,588 --> 00:47:38,555
What?

470
00:47:42,259 --> 00:47:44,784
What an arrogant girl.
I will take care of her later

471
00:47:45,429 --> 00:47:46,726
It's all because of him

472
00:47:49,266 --> 00:47:52,064
He damaged my image
before a beautiful girl

473
00:47:52,269 --> 00:47:54,328
Having done all this
see how he is sleeping

474
00:48:18,295 --> 00:48:20,354
Stop it!

475
00:48:22,966 --> 00:48:26,367
What is this?
Early morning can't you find...

476
00:48:26,637 --> 00:48:31,438
any other place to teach music?
It has become a big nuisance with you

477
00:48:31,975 --> 00:48:36,173
At nights you walk with anklets,
laugh frighten us, and ruin our sleep

478
00:48:36,480 --> 00:48:40,280
Early morning you sing and wake up
all the those who are sleeping

479
00:48:41,652 --> 00:48:45,850
This is not right. I came here
to rest, I have lost my peace

480
00:48:46,323 --> 00:48:53,456
Kids, why do you scream like this?
Go, watch good movies in TV

481
00:48:58,502 --> 00:49:00,299
Look here, Darga...
- Durga!

482
00:49:01,004 --> 00:49:03,472
If you want to teach music,
go to a temple...

483
00:49:03,674 --> 00:49:07,405
or a hall or river side
don't do it here

484
00:49:07,678 --> 00:49:11,978
My friend has bought
this palace shelling out crores

485
00:49:12,182 --> 00:49:14,150
Is this palace meant for you
to teach music?

486
00:49:14,351 --> 00:49:19,152
No, change your location tomorrow.
If I hear the sound again...

487
00:49:19,356 --> 00:49:22,985
I will drive you and
your grandfather away

488
00:49:23,193 --> 00:49:26,651
Look, what ever you do, the
music classes will be held right here

489
00:49:26,863 --> 00:49:28,558
From tomorrow it would be more noisy

490
00:49:29,533 --> 00:49:32,161
If you have decided to go
from this house what can I do?

491
00:49:32,369 --> 00:49:36,499
If I am to forgo my music
I don't want to live in this place

492
00:49:37,207 --> 00:49:42,509
She's an orphan. A bit short tempered
but doesn't take anything to heart

493
00:49:42,713 --> 00:49:47,514
Until you leave this place I will ask
her not to conduct classes here

494
00:49:47,718 --> 00:49:49,015
I beg of you

495
00:50:17,748 --> 00:50:18,806
Don't

496
00:50:19,750 --> 00:50:25,711
You may be a modern girl and
would like to see what's up there

497
00:50:26,256 --> 00:50:30,716
But in such matters
you should listen to elders

498
00:50:31,094 --> 00:50:31,822
Come downstairs

499
00:50:44,107 --> 00:50:44,903
Who is that?

500
00:50:47,444 --> 00:50:48,172
You?

501
00:50:48,445 --> 00:50:50,845
What are you doing here
at this time?

502
00:50:51,281 --> 00:50:55,081
I couldn't sleep so I thought I'd
come here for some fresh air

503
00:50:55,285 --> 00:50:56,309
Love?

504
00:50:56,953 --> 00:50:58,921
Are you in love?
- How do you know?

505
00:50:59,122 --> 00:51:02,649
It is evident from your face

506
00:51:03,126 --> 00:51:06,926
The day your dad asked you
to come and see your groom...

507
00:51:07,130 --> 00:51:12,261
you were unperturbed and calm.
I knew then itself you were in love

508
00:51:12,469 --> 00:51:13,936
Tell me, who he is?

509
00:51:14,471 --> 00:51:18,601
Viswanath. Dance professor.
He lives there

510
00:51:18,809 --> 00:51:23,678
I see. Good selection.
- Do you know him?

511
00:51:25,148 --> 00:51:30,780
I know him, I also know who
made him stay in that house

512
00:51:31,321 --> 00:51:33,289
Have you expressed your love?
- Yes

513
00:51:33,490 --> 00:51:35,617
What did he say?
- He asked my dad to come

514
00:51:35,826 --> 00:51:37,293
Didn't you tell him about it?
- I am scared

515
00:51:37,494 --> 00:51:40,292
Then how will your love succeed?
What's your dad's name?

516
00:51:40,497 --> 00:51:41,691
Kandaswamy

517
00:51:46,169 --> 00:51:48,797
Your daughter is in love here,
and you are sleeping?

518
00:51:49,840 --> 00:51:50,568
Hey Mustache!

519
00:51:52,843 --> 00:51:53,969
Oh God

520
00:51:56,513 --> 00:51:59,482
Why are you here at this hour?
- Nothing, just came for some fresh air...

521
00:51:59,683 --> 00:52:01,583
Fresh air? Get lost

522
00:52:09,526 --> 00:52:10,993
What are you doing here at this time?
- Alliance

523
00:52:11,194 --> 00:52:12,491
Alliance?
- Ok, research

524
00:52:12,696 --> 00:52:14,596
Research?
- Love

525
00:52:18,535 --> 00:52:21,834
First this doctor should be
driven out of the house, isn't it?

526
00:52:22,038 --> 00:52:25,405
I told you this that day itself.
You are late

527
00:52:26,877 --> 00:52:30,176
He is interested on that girl.
My wife is saved

528
00:52:31,882 --> 00:52:36,410
A bachelor has one worry, whereas
a married man has thousand worries

529
00:52:37,053 --> 00:52:38,350
Look here

530
00:52:39,222 --> 00:52:41,190
1001st worry

531
00:52:50,233 --> 00:52:53,031
He's just so accurate...!

532
00:52:58,074 --> 00:53:03,706
Grandpa, it's 9 o'clock and yet
no one has come

533
00:53:03,914 --> 00:53:06,974
They won't come.
- Why not?

534
00:53:07,250 --> 00:53:11,380
Bommi is here.
Where are the others?

535
00:53:11,588 --> 00:53:17,049
The uncle who scolded you yesterday,
gave us money...

536
00:53:17,260 --> 00:53:23,324
and asked us not to come for classes.
He asked us to go and watch a movie

537
00:53:23,934 --> 00:53:28,064
Until he goes back it would be better
not to conduct music classes

538
00:53:33,777 --> 00:53:34,573
Durga

539
00:53:39,616 --> 00:53:45,248
Because you don't like me
teaching music...

540
00:53:45,455 --> 00:53:47,685
you stopped them from
attending the classes?

541
00:53:48,458 --> 00:53:51,586
You can only give them money
and send them for movies

542
00:53:52,295 --> 00:53:55,753
But can you buy music
with your money?

543
00:53:55,966 --> 00:53:57,490
I have already bought it

544
00:54:04,975 --> 00:54:08,604
My harmonium?
- I bought all these instruments

545
00:54:08,812 --> 00:54:14,182
Except this box. Your grandpa
gave me this trivia, free of cost

546
00:54:19,389 --> 00:54:24,224
Music is like Saraswathy

547
00:54:25,395 --> 00:54:28,626
It's in the blood by birth

548
00:54:29,899 --> 00:54:38,830
Arrogant people like you will not
understand its importance ever

549
00:54:39,142 --> 00:54:40,871
You will never...

550
00:54:41,077 --> 00:54:43,511
understand! You...
- Look here Darga

551
00:54:45,081 --> 00:54:49,040
Don't curse me, it might come true.
Not for the sake of this box!

552
00:54:49,252 --> 00:54:51,584
You may take it.
- This one?

553
00:54:51,788 --> 00:54:57,021
I won't touch the harmonium
used by you

554
00:55:47,344 --> 00:55:51,075
<i>The Civet hill does not dance.
Bommi dances...</i>

555
00:55:51,181 --> 00:55:54,776
<i>This is a lullaby by God.
Hear it, Bommi</i>

556
00:55:54,984 --> 00:55:58,545
<i>My music enthralls, Bommi</i>

557
00:55:58,755 --> 00:56:02,384
<i>lt, s His song that pervades</i>

558
00:56:02,592 --> 00:56:06,221
<i>I have sung the song
bestowed by Lord Shiva</i>

559
00:56:06,429 --> 00:56:11,389
<i>Through the song
I captivated millions</i>

560
00:56:58,648 --> 00:57:00,878
<i>Circular buds bloomed...</i>

561
00:57:01,084 --> 00:57:08,388
<i>when the breeze caressed</i>

562
00:57:08,725 --> 00:57:09,851
<i>Buds...</i>

563
00:57:10,059 --> 00:57:18,626
<i>gently attunes melody</i>

564
00:57:18,835 --> 00:57:20,962
<i>Music must make one dance...</i>

565
00:57:21,171 --> 00:57:24,231
<i>and swing</i>

566
00:57:29,279 --> 00:57:33,807
<i>Music must make one hear
and captivate</i>

567
00:57:34,017 --> 00:57:39,819
<i>Hearing this music the earth
would always orbit</i>

568
00:58:21,798 --> 00:58:31,867
<i>Tying little cradles a mother, s
lullaby is also music</i>

569
00:58:32,242 --> 00:58:37,077
<i>Man and woman on cot
attuning melody of desires...</i>

570
00:58:37,280 --> 00:58:41,876
<i>is also music</i>

571
00:58:42,085 --> 00:58:44,383
<i>Oh mind, get appeased</i>

572
00:58:44,587 --> 00:58:47,579
<i>Who is the mastermind here?</i>

573
00:58:52,595 --> 00:58:54,563
<i>Check what you know</i>

574
00:58:54,764 --> 00:58:57,130
<i>Gather what is not there</i>

575
00:58:57,333 --> 00:59:03,704
<i>There, s no one who knows everything,
who comprehends everything</i>

576
00:59:13,416 --> 00:59:15,577
<i>The Civet hill does not dance</i>

577
00:59:15,785 --> 00:59:20,848
<i>Dancing Bommi, this is
a lullaby by God</i>

578
00:59:21,057 --> 00:59:24,618
<i>Hearing my song mind
would jump in joy</i>

579
00:59:24,827 --> 00:59:28,524
<i>Is there a place
where His song is not heard?</i>

580
00:59:28,865 --> 00:59:32,562
<i>I have sung the song
bestowed by Lord Shiva</i>

581
00:59:32,802 --> 00:59:36,260
<i>Through the song
I captivated millions</i>

582
00:59:49,485 --> 00:59:51,510
Fantastic! You were wonderful

583
00:59:51,721 --> 00:59:55,919
You have made us dance.
- He does everything nicely

584
00:59:56,993 --> 00:59:59,962
What do you think of my friend?

585
01:00:00,296 --> 01:00:05,859
At a time... he can answer 10 different
questions posed by 10 different people

586
01:00:06,069 --> 01:00:08,970
He's not an ordinary man.
He's extraordinary

587
01:00:10,573 --> 01:00:14,475
What are you watching?
Go inside

588
01:00:16,346 --> 01:00:20,248
Why do you look there?
- Super dress

589
01:00:27,857 --> 01:00:29,620
A wiseman does not require advice

590
01:00:30,827 --> 01:00:32,988
A capable man does not
require advertisement

591
01:00:34,130 --> 01:00:38,464
Through your song
you have taught me a lot

592
01:00:41,404 --> 01:00:42,564
Forgive me

593
01:00:51,781 --> 01:00:53,373
A message for doctor Saravanan

594
01:00:55,518 --> 01:01:00,353
You've got an e-mail

595
01:01:02,992 --> 01:01:05,790
What happened?
- One of your patients is serious

596
01:01:05,995 --> 01:01:08,964
Wants you to return.
- Is it a bad news?

597
01:01:09,165 --> 01:01:11,463
Is it not? You said you will
stay here for a month

598
01:01:11,668 --> 01:01:14,660
But within 6 days you
have been called back

599
01:01:15,238 --> 01:01:18,264
Senthil, a doctor can wait
for the patient...

600
01:01:18,474 --> 01:01:20,635
but a patient should not
wait for the doctor. I'm leaving

601
01:01:20,843 --> 01:01:21,741
What Saravanan?

602
01:01:26,182 --> 01:01:27,649
Saravanan will appear

603
01:01:37,627 --> 01:01:41,028
Sir, I am leaving.
- Really? Take this

604
01:01:41,364 --> 01:01:47,234
Now I am happy. Happy that
you're leaving so soon

605
01:01:47,437 --> 01:01:49,667
Go ahead.
- Correct

606
01:01:50,106 --> 01:01:54,236
You are happy that I'm leaving so soon

607
01:01:54,811 --> 01:01:57,609
But I have finished
a 6 month's job...

608
01:01:57,814 --> 01:02:00,112
In...?
- In just 6 days

609
01:02:05,621 --> 01:02:09,614
The other day we talked about love.
Have you informed your dad?

610
01:02:09,826 --> 01:02:10,622
Love?

611
01:02:11,494 --> 01:02:15,191
Doctor, you left your specs in my room.
- In your room?

612
01:02:15,631 --> 01:02:17,963
I'll take that later.
Let me talk about Priya's love

613
01:02:18,167 --> 01:02:21,330
How dare you talk about
my daughter's affair to me?

614
01:02:21,537 --> 01:02:27,840
Who else should I talk to then?
Do you want me to say it all...

615
01:02:28,044 --> 01:02:29,238
to all the magazines and press?

616
01:02:29,479 --> 01:02:34,940
How can you fall in love with
a complete stranger? How dare you!

617
01:02:35,251 --> 01:02:39,187
Don't get excited. I said she was
in love. Did I say with me?

618
01:02:39,922 --> 01:02:42,720
Priya is in love with
dance professor Viswanath

619
01:02:46,863 --> 01:02:50,959
Yes. Viswanathan is a good boy,
a right match for your daughter

620
01:02:51,167 --> 01:02:54,068
The other day I was talking
only about this to Priya

621
01:02:54,337 --> 01:02:56,703
Next day I talked to Viswanathan.
With your consent...

622
01:02:56,906 --> 01:03:03,243
he is prepared to marry Priya,
he said. So think about it

623
01:03:03,446 --> 01:03:05,971
Don't lose a good alliance
on false prestige

624
01:03:06,215 --> 01:03:08,979
However hard you try you may not
get such a good boy

625
01:03:09,185 --> 01:03:11,278
Once the marriage is fixed
send me an invitation

626
01:03:11,487 --> 01:03:15,116
If required, your second daughter...
- I'll surely invite you. Please leave

627
01:03:15,324 --> 01:03:16,621
Really?
- Really

628
01:03:18,795 --> 01:03:21,628
I forget someone... yes, Swarna

629
01:03:28,371 --> 01:03:30,999
I won't allow you to talk to my wife
even at the risk of my life

630
01:03:31,207 --> 01:03:34,540
Look at his dress.
He is wearing the shirt inside out

631
01:03:34,744 --> 01:03:38,305
lt'd be better to tear it to pieces.
- Is it your dad's property?

632
01:03:38,614 --> 01:03:40,741
It's my money, it's my dough

633
01:03:40,950 --> 01:03:44,716
I may tear it, may not tear it.
What will you do?

634
01:03:47,323 --> 01:03:52,488
This maid has such a sexy hip.
Bad timing! Not when he is around

635
01:03:52,695 --> 01:03:58,327
What will I do? Tonight, somehow,
I am going to get her

636
01:03:58,534 --> 01:04:01,526
This is too much
- What?

637
01:04:01,737 --> 01:04:03,762
Too much. Swarna...

638
01:04:04,340 --> 01:04:07,571
The chicken...
- He asked for chicken, I didn't buy

639
01:04:07,777 --> 01:04:10,041
So he wants to complain about me.
- You see...

640
01:04:10,246 --> 01:04:14,546
Sir, Rajathi Raja, Arunachala
Padyappa, Thalapathi, Manna...

641
01:04:14,750 --> 01:04:18,584
you may leave! Don't break
a happy family

642
01:04:18,788 --> 01:04:21,222
You may leave

643
01:04:21,424 --> 01:04:25,656
What did he say?
- Nothing. He wants us to eat chicken

644
01:04:26,128 --> 01:04:27,823
What?
- A small story

645
01:04:28,030 --> 01:04:29,019
Tell me and leave

646
01:04:29,799 --> 01:04:34,031
This guy cannot even stand up...

647
01:04:34,604 --> 01:04:36,765
but he likes to have 9 wives

648
01:04:41,611 --> 01:04:42,669
Wait

649
01:04:42,879 --> 01:04:45,609
Ganga, I forgot to tell you
I was leaving

650
01:04:45,815 --> 01:04:49,080
You said one month, but you are
leaving in 6 days. Liar

651
01:04:49,285 --> 01:04:51,617
You think disease comes with a notice?
What is this?

652
01:04:51,821 --> 01:04:53,311
For you, to eat on your way.
- All this?

653
01:04:53,522 --> 01:04:54,853
Yes, eat nicely

654
01:04:56,092 --> 01:04:58,151
Do you know what is
the best medicine in world is?

655
01:04:58,461 --> 01:04:59,587
What?
- Food

656
01:04:59,795 --> 01:05:02,662
If you eat to a limit it is medicine.
If you over eat it is poison

657
01:05:10,406 --> 01:05:15,002
Wherever I am, I keep people
around me happy

658
01:05:15,411 --> 01:05:20,713
I did the same thing here also
but I was little excessive to you

659
01:05:22,585 --> 01:05:26,077
If you feel so, forget it

660
01:05:27,456 --> 01:05:28,616
But don't forget me

661
01:05:30,126 --> 01:05:32,094
Bye. May I...?

662
01:05:36,766 --> 01:05:38,597
Sorry... bye

663
01:06:01,624 --> 01:06:04,957
Durga come here,
want to talk to you in private

664
01:06:06,729 --> 01:06:11,598
What Madam? - No formalities.
Call me Ganga

665
01:06:12,068 --> 01:06:13,865
Ok Ganga, tell me what is it?

666
01:06:14,637 --> 01:06:17,936
I have a lot of old books with me.
I want to keep them in...

667
01:06:18,741 --> 01:06:22,438
some room upstairs in the building.
Will you accompany me?

668
01:06:22,645 --> 01:06:25,170
My God! Even my grandpa
doesn't go there

669
01:06:25,381 --> 01:06:30,375
He has also asked me not to go there.
Because Chandramukhi's room is there

670
01:06:30,586 --> 01:06:34,488
Old people have that fear.
Why should we fear? Am I not with you?

671
01:06:34,857 --> 01:06:35,619
Let's go

672
01:06:38,427 --> 01:06:40,657
Ok, you need not come, I am going

673
01:06:44,433 --> 01:06:46,025
What about the people at home?

674
01:06:46,168 --> 01:06:50,127
All have gone to meet Viswanathan
regarding the alliance with Priya

675
01:06:52,641 --> 01:06:56,042
In that case I will come

676
01:06:58,614 --> 01:07:01,879
I didn't love your daughter
for her beauty or status

677
01:07:02,918 --> 01:07:05,682
I lost my parents at a young age

678
01:07:06,155 --> 01:07:10,615
But I wanted to live in a joint family,
so I accepted your daughter's love

679
01:07:11,193 --> 01:07:16,221
That is quite understandable.
I also like the groom... you too like...

680
01:07:16,365 --> 01:07:18,890
We have only seen the groom

681
01:07:19,769 --> 01:07:21,930
Shouldn't we finalise the auspicious
dates for the ceremonies?

682
01:07:22,138 --> 01:07:25,039
Sister, today is a good day,
we can finalise them today itself

683
01:07:26,108 --> 01:07:30,204
My daughter's engagement should
not be held in a tiled house

684
01:07:30,546 --> 01:07:32,537
It should be done in the fort
and in a grand manner

685
01:07:32,748 --> 01:07:35,615
I am glad that you have agreed

686
01:07:35,818 --> 01:07:39,584
Coming 16th is an auspicious day.
Let's do it your way

687
01:08:24,967 --> 01:08:27,094
I think this is the room

688
01:08:28,437 --> 01:08:30,564
Why are there so many amulets?

689
01:08:31,507 --> 01:08:35,136
150 years ago, prayers were
conducted here

690
01:08:36,178 --> 01:08:40,444
Chandramukhi's spirit
is locked up here

691
01:08:40,983 --> 01:08:42,245
Do you believe these stories?

692
01:08:42,785 --> 01:08:43,683
Whatelse?

693
01:08:43,853 --> 01:08:47,254
I think this room has valuable
jewels and diamonds

694
01:08:47,756 --> 01:08:51,556
To prevent theft, these stories
must have been floated

695
01:08:52,228 --> 01:08:56,221
If I get the keys to this room
I would open and show it to you

696
01:08:56,765 --> 01:08:59,563
This room has no key,
it has been lost

697
01:09:00,369 --> 01:09:07,332
But my grandpa told me once... that the
key's mould is available with a blacksmith

698
01:09:08,177 --> 01:09:10,668
We will ask the blacksmith
to make the key immediately

699
01:09:10,880 --> 01:09:13,280
You own the house.
You tell him

700
01:09:13,716 --> 01:09:16,651
If you want, I will bring the key
after it is made

701
01:09:16,852 --> 01:09:17,819
I will order right away

702
01:09:29,565 --> 01:09:32,295
What?
- Here, the key to Chandramukhi's room

703
01:12:17,399 --> 01:12:20,527
What?
- Please don't open this door

704
01:12:20,736 --> 01:12:23,705
What happened?
- The guy who made the key...

705
01:12:24,340 --> 01:12:27,639
has died vomiting blood

706
01:12:29,778 --> 01:12:32,770
If this is the end for the guy
who made the key...

707
01:12:33,849 --> 01:12:37,341
what would happen to me,
who brought this key?

708
01:12:37,786 --> 01:12:41,586
I'm scared.
- Yesterday when I placed the order...

709
01:12:41,790 --> 01:12:48,127
he was drunk. A guy who drinks 24 hours,
would die whether he makes a key or not

710
01:12:48,697 --> 01:12:51,564
It's good he died
after making the key

711
01:12:51,867 --> 01:12:54,563
Don't confuse yourself, be brave

712
01:12:59,441 --> 01:13:03,537
You say the old man died because
he made a key for the southern room

713
01:13:03,746 --> 01:13:06,306
But Ganga who went into the room
is perfectly alright

714
01:13:06,648 --> 01:13:07,478
You are right.

715
01:13:08,584 --> 01:13:14,716
Trust me. The old man
died of a rotten liver

716
01:13:15,157 --> 01:13:20,026
I may sound funny... don't know, what
more is going to happen in this house?

717
01:13:26,635 --> 01:13:29,001
Hoil? It's a marwari festival, right?

718
01:14:12,781 --> 01:14:19,345
Please call the ghost gently or else
it might harm us before it leaves
