1
00:00:15,600 --> 00:00:18,592
(Line of prayer sung in Punjabi)

2
00:01:16,400 --> 00:01:18,311
(Low conversation)

3
00:01:32,640 --> 00:01:34,790
This is the conveyor belt?

4
00:01:34,840 --> 00:01:36,751
Mind out.

5
00:01:39,240 --> 00:01:40,434
<i>Wait, wait, wait.</i>

6
00:01:42,280 --> 00:01:44,635
Balraj! Can you get the other one?

7
00:01:44,680 --> 00:01:46,671
Can you check this one?

8
00:01:46,720 --> 00:01:48,153
I just did.

9
00:01:52,160 --> 00:01:54,879
<i>AMERICAN: This is mayhem.
This is like bedlam.</i>

10
00:01:54,920 --> 00:01:56,638
Good, isn't it?

11
00:02:00,960 --> 00:02:02,837
What do you mean
it's a bit like New York?

12
00:02:02,880 --> 00:02:05,838
<i>WOMAN: Better get used to it, Darcy.
We're here for two weeks.</i>

13
00:02:08,680 --> 00:02:10,591
(Street vendors shout)

14
00:02:15,560 --> 00:02:17,471
(Bellowing)

15
00:02:17,520 --> 00:02:19,351
(Car horns beep)

16
00:02:20,640 --> 00:02:23,518
Jesus, Balraj, where the hell
have you brought me?

17
00:02:36,480 --> 00:02:38,755
<i>(Woman shouts) Hurry up, you silly girls!</i>

18
00:02:38,800 --> 00:02:43,157
We must make sure Jaya meets
this Mr Balraj from London before anyone else.

19
00:02:43,200 --> 00:02:47,716
All mothers think that any single guy
with big bucks must be shopping for a wife.

20
00:02:47,760 --> 00:02:49,955
I'm embarrassed to say,
but I hope he is.

21
00:02:50,600 --> 00:02:52,511
What, shopping or loaded?

22
00:02:52,560 --> 00:02:54,278
Well, both.

23
00:02:55,040 --> 00:02:57,474
Lakhi, you think your mother
has gone crazy?

24
00:02:57,520 --> 00:02:59,431
That I am letting you wear that?

25
00:02:59,480 --> 00:03:02,153
I told you, Lakhi. It's very vulgar.

26
00:03:02,760 --> 00:03:05,069
But, Mama. It's killing, Mama!

27
00:03:05,840 --> 00:03:09,116
Oh, if it's killing, it's what everyone's
wearing in Mumbai.

28
00:03:09,160 --> 00:03:12,835
But we want Balraj to look into Jaya's eyes,
not your mames.

29
00:03:12,880 --> 00:03:14,472
<i>She's our only hope.</i>

30
00:03:14,520 --> 00:03:16,636
<i>If we do not get the eldest married first,</i>

31
00:03:16,680 --> 00:03:19,478
<i>we'll never be able to marry rest of you
for the shame.</i>

32
00:03:20,120 --> 00:03:21,553
(Music plays inside)

33
00:03:21,600 --> 00:03:23,113
Come on, Lakhi, it's only a party.

34
00:03:23,160 --> 00:03:25,390
Save your fussing for the big wedding tomorrow.

35
00:03:25,440 --> 00:03:27,271
Papa, just chill. Let me fix my dupatta.

36
00:03:27,320 --> 00:03:29,231
Oh! Nameste.

37
00:03:30,040 --> 00:03:31,871
WOMAN: Chandra, make sure you smile.

38
00:03:31,920 --> 00:03:33,751
Now, sit back.

39
00:03:35,040 --> 00:03:37,031
- Hi, Lakhi.
- Hi.

40
00:03:39,600 --> 00:03:41,272
Hello, dear.

41
00:03:41,320 --> 00:03:43,754
- Can we sit here?
- Of course!

42
00:03:43,800 --> 00:03:46,872
- Mama, we'll go and see the bride.
- OK, come soon.

43
00:03:46,920 --> 00:03:49,229
- Chandra, don't be too long.
- OK.

44
00:03:53,120 --> 00:03:57,113
Oh, this must be the famous Balraj from UK.

45
00:03:57,160 --> 00:03:59,549
He's from the Uppal family of Delhi, you know.

46
00:03:59,600 --> 00:04:02,034
Hey, Balraj, you made it in one piece
from London.

47
00:04:02,080 --> 00:04:03,433
<i>MRS BAKSHI: Is that his name?</i>

48
00:04:03,480 --> 00:04:06,631
I completely forgot
groom is bringing guest from England.

49
00:04:06,680 --> 00:04:08,591
Apparently, he's a barrister.

50
00:04:09,920 --> 00:04:11,797
Is that right? A barrister?

51
00:04:11,840 --> 00:04:14,912
And his family live in Windsor,
near the Queen's castle.

52
00:04:14,960 --> 00:04:17,235
Really? Next to the Queen?

53
00:04:17,280 --> 00:04:21,353
<i>CHANDRA'S MOTHER:
Oh, his sister is looking so lovely.</i>

54
00:04:21,400 --> 00:04:23,311
<i>So fair, nah?</i>

55
00:04:23,360 --> 00:04:26,079
<i>- Who's that Englishman with him?
- He's American.</i>

56
00:04:26,120 --> 00:04:28,076
<i>His name is William Darcy.</i>

57
00:04:28,120 --> 00:04:30,714
<i>He was Balraj's fast friend at Oxford.</i>

58
00:04:30,760 --> 00:04:33,354
From one of the richest families in America.

59
00:04:33,400 --> 00:04:35,516
<i>They own hotels all over the world.</i>

60
00:04:35,560 --> 00:04:37,471
Shame he's not Indian, though.

61
00:04:37,520 --> 00:04:39,431
(Both laugh)

62
00:04:40,040 --> 00:04:43,112
Sure you're OK about going away to London?
You only met him twice.

63
00:04:43,160 --> 00:04:45,116
He's nice and so is his family.

64
00:04:46,720 --> 00:04:48,597
You need to get out of this town, Lalita.

65
00:04:48,640 --> 00:04:50,551
You know there's nothing for you here.

66
00:04:50,600 --> 00:04:53,034
<i>All the guysjust want girls from rich families.</i>

67
00:04:53,080 --> 00:04:54,991
Papa needs me. I couldn't leave.

68
00:04:55,040 --> 00:04:57,076
His friend Balraj is great.

69
00:04:58,240 --> 00:05:00,196
He's looking for a girl too, you know.

70
00:05:02,280 --> 00:05:05,795
Good Lord, is it me,
or is every woman over 50 giving you the eye?

71
00:05:06,800 --> 00:05:08,279
<i>Don't be dense, Darcy.</i>

72
00:05:08,320 --> 00:05:12,472
Every mother in this room is wetting
her knickers for him for their daughters.

73
00:05:12,520 --> 00:05:14,909
- Can we leave yet?
- Kiran, I'm his best man.

74
00:05:14,960 --> 00:05:16,678
I can't just bail out on him, can I?

75
00:05:16,720 --> 00:05:19,314
It's 10am in New York.
I wouldn't mind getting back early

76
00:05:19,360 --> 00:05:21,874
so I can go through the financials
on that hotel in Goa.

77
00:05:21,920 --> 00:05:23,956
Will you stop working, just this once?

78
00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:25,911
And you stop being such a coconut.

79
00:05:25,960 --> 00:05:28,599
This is our dear, dear motherland. Enjoy it.

80
00:05:28,640 --> 00:05:31,313
The only thing India's good for is losing weight.

81
00:05:31,360 --> 00:05:35,319
Are you sure this is safe to eat?
I don't want to get Delhi belly on my first day.

82
00:05:35,360 --> 00:05:36,873
(Lively drumming starts)

83
00:05:36,920 --> 00:05:38,911
(Cheering)

84
00:05:45,280 --> 00:05:48,272
- What's happening now?
- The Indian version of American Idol.

85
00:05:48,320 --> 00:05:49,912
I hope you've brought earplugs.

86
00:05:49,960 --> 00:05:53,555
This is where the girls tease the boys,
and the boys tease the girls.

87
00:06:01,120 --> 00:06:02,838
<i>KIRIN: Brace yourself, Darcy.</i>

88
00:06:02,880 --> 00:06:05,633
He's about to transform
into the Indian MC Hammer.

89
00:06:12,720 --> 00:06:14,358
What are they like?

90
00:06:21,120 --> 00:06:22,758
(Singing in Punjabi)

91
00:06:38,880 --> 00:06:40,950
<i>DARC Y: What are they singing?</i>

92
00:06:41,000 --> 00:06:45,790
Oh, these pretty girls
fluttering temptingly like kites without string.

93
00:08:08,520 --> 00:08:10,636
These girls are like naked live wires.

94
00:08:10,680 --> 00:08:13,797
If you get too close,
you'll get an electric shock of love.

95
00:08:13,880 --> 00:08:15,108
Ooh!

96
00:08:21,760 --> 00:08:24,354
Oh, my gosh, she's beautiful!

97
00:08:29,800 --> 00:08:31,711
There's still time.

98
00:09:08,840 --> 00:09:10,751
(Laughter)

99
00:09:31,760 --> 00:09:33,591
That's fantastic. Thank you.

100
00:09:34,960 --> 00:09:36,871
- (Cheering)
- Come and dance.

101
00:09:36,920 --> 00:09:38,831
You must be joking.

102
00:09:39,840 --> 00:09:41,751
The two of you, dance.

103
00:10:12,320 --> 00:10:14,231
(Whistling and cheering)

104
00:10:21,080 --> 00:10:22,354
KIRAN: Let go of me!

105
00:10:26,760 --> 00:10:28,671
Thank you.

106
00:10:37,160 --> 00:10:39,276
Darcy, what are you doing?

107
00:10:40,240 --> 00:10:42,708
- My drawstring keeps coming undone.
- Let's see.

108
00:10:42,760 --> 00:10:45,115
I don't know why
you made me wear these pants.

109
00:10:45,160 --> 00:10:47,435
Why don't we just alert the media?

110
00:10:47,480 --> 00:10:49,357
<i>GIRL: She's too outrageous.</i>

111
00:10:49,400 --> 00:10:51,834
<i>I'm telling you, she'll give us all a bad name.</i>

112
00:10:51,880 --> 00:10:54,952
You know she is spending all night texting boys?

113
00:10:55,000 --> 00:10:56,558
Lakhi.

114
00:10:56,600 --> 00:10:58,556
Stop it now. Lakhi.

115
00:10:58,600 --> 00:11:00,795
Good evening, sir.
We're from the groom's side.

116
00:11:00,840 --> 00:11:02,876
We'd like to introduce ourselves, if we may.

117
00:11:02,920 --> 00:11:04,319
I'm Balraj.

118
00:11:04,360 --> 00:11:06,078
- This is my sister Kiran.
- Hi.

119
00:11:06,120 --> 00:11:08,634
- And my good friend William Darcy.
- Hello.

120
00:11:08,680 --> 00:11:11,274
Very nice to meet you all.
Er, I'm Chaman Bakshi.

121
00:11:11,320 --> 00:11:13,276
<i>May I introduce my family to you?</i>

122
00:11:13,320 --> 00:11:15,993
<i>This is my wife, Mrs Manurma Rama Bakshi,</i>

123
00:11:16,040 --> 00:11:20,113
and, er, these are my daughters:
Jaya, Lalita, that's Lakhi and that's Maya.

124
00:11:20,160 --> 00:11:23,755
Four daughters in one family!
God has blessed you four times over.

125
00:11:23,800 --> 00:11:27,156
Such a pleasure
to make your fine acquaintance.

126
00:11:27,880 --> 00:11:29,916
<i>BALRAJ: Would you do me the honour?</i>

127
00:11:29,960 --> 00:11:30,995
Papa?

128
00:11:31,040 --> 00:11:33,110
Of course, of course. Please, please.

129
00:11:34,600 --> 00:11:38,752
Darcy, why don't you ask
one of Jaya's lovely sisters to dance as well?

130
00:11:38,800 --> 00:11:40,233
No.

131
00:11:40,280 --> 00:11:42,794
Um, I'm sorry. I can't. I must get back and work.

132
00:11:42,840 --> 00:11:44,751
<i>I have a conference call.</i>

133
00:11:44,800 --> 00:11:46,233
But it's easier than you think.

134
00:11:46,280 --> 00:11:48,510
- I can show you.
- No, I really can't.

135
00:11:48,560 --> 00:11:50,835
Maybe another time.

136
00:11:55,640 --> 00:11:57,232
Rich American.

137
00:11:57,280 --> 00:12:00,238
What does he think -
we are not good enough for him?

138
00:12:05,160 --> 00:12:06,878
(Low conversation)

139
00:12:07,560 --> 00:12:10,233
You should have seen Mrs Lamba's face.

140
00:12:10,280 --> 00:12:13,238
Balraj didn't dance with any other girl all night.

141
00:12:14,240 --> 00:12:17,471
I knew he wouldn't be able to resist
my pretty Jaya's charms.

142
00:12:17,520 --> 00:12:18,509
Mama.

143
00:12:18,560 --> 00:12:20,073
Or yours, I'm sure.

144
00:12:20,120 --> 00:12:25,592
Just imagine - if Jaya went to live in UK,
we could visit her any time.

145
00:12:25,640 --> 00:12:27,835
I would hate to have my daughters so far away.

146
00:12:27,880 --> 00:12:30,599
But we have so many.
One or two can go abroad.

147
00:12:30,640 --> 00:12:32,517
<i>They'll earn more. God knows they need to,</i>

148
00:12:32,560 --> 00:12:35,518
because we can't afford to give them
all decent dowries.

149
00:12:35,560 --> 00:12:38,438
Perhaps we should have drowned some
at the time of their birth.

150
00:12:38,480 --> 00:12:41,119
We wouldn't have had these problems
if we had gone to US.

151
00:12:41,160 --> 00:12:44,357
Did I tell you about this fellow
who went to America and made it rich?

152
00:12:44,400 --> 00:12:47,870
My brother did all the paperwork to sponsor us
but you didn't want to leave.

153
00:12:47,920 --> 00:12:50,753
This fellow went to America
and bought a huge American house

154
00:12:50,800 --> 00:12:52,233
<i>and built three swimming pools.</i>

155
00:12:52,280 --> 00:12:54,919
Now he owns three Subway franchises
in New Jersey.

156
00:12:54,960 --> 00:12:56,632
And what do we have?

157
00:12:56,680 --> 00:13:00,070
An old house, an old farm, and new bills.

158
00:13:00,120 --> 00:13:03,317
So when his father visited from India,
he showed him around his mansion

159
00:13:03,360 --> 00:13:05,078
and three swimming pools.

160
00:13:05,120 --> 00:13:07,953
His father asked,
"But, son, why do you need three pools?"

161
00:13:08,000 --> 00:13:12,152
So he said proudly, "Well, one is filled
with cold water for when I feel hot.

162
00:13:12,200 --> 00:13:14,634
The second is filled with hot water
when I feel cold. "

163
00:13:14,680 --> 00:13:17,752
The father nodded and said,
"But why is the third pool empty?"

164
00:13:17,800 --> 00:13:21,270
He said, "Well, that's when
I don't feel like swimming at all. "

165
00:13:21,320 --> 00:13:23,515
(Daughters laugh)

166
00:13:23,560 --> 00:13:25,232
Ha-ha, ha-ha, ha-ha, ha-ha.

167
00:13:28,320 --> 00:13:31,835
Listen, Balraj, if you really wanna get married,

168
00:13:31,880 --> 00:13:34,952
hook up with an Indian girl from England,
or even America.

169
00:13:35,000 --> 00:13:36,638
You'd have something in common.

170
00:13:36,680 --> 00:13:39,831
Look, I didn't have any problems
talking with Jaya, did I?

171
00:13:39,880 --> 00:13:42,952
She's intelligent, she's beautiful.

172
00:13:43,000 --> 00:13:44,479
Come on, Bal.

173
00:13:44,520 --> 00:13:46,238
Look around you.

174
00:13:46,280 --> 00:13:48,077
You said it yourself, man.

175
00:13:48,120 --> 00:13:49,792
We're in Hicksville India.

176
00:13:51,480 --> 00:13:53,436
Then why did I see you eyeing up Lalita?

177
00:13:59,480 --> 00:14:01,755
She's beautiful, yeah, but...

178
00:14:01,800 --> 00:14:05,634
But not your mum's idea
of the mother of her heirs, right?

179
00:14:05,680 --> 00:14:07,398
Not exactly, no.

180
00:14:08,520 --> 00:14:10,476
- Bye.
- Give me that bag.

181
00:14:11,440 --> 00:14:13,351
- Why?
- I want to go over there.

182
00:14:13,400 --> 00:14:15,356
- Come.
- Just give me the bag.

183
00:14:15,400 --> 00:14:17,550
¤ Is this going to be

184
00:14:17,600 --> 00:14:20,194
¤ The last time we three

185
00:14:20,680 --> 00:14:24,514
¤ Walk down this street together?

186
00:14:25,720 --> 00:14:28,314
¤ She's going to be wed

187
00:14:28,360 --> 00:14:30,476
¤ It doesn't mean she's dead

188
00:14:31,080 --> 00:14:35,517
¤ We'll be friends for ever

189
00:14:36,040 --> 00:14:38,713
¤ It's not long before the day

190
00:14:38,760 --> 00:14:41,354
¤ I up, up, up and fly away

191
00:14:41,400 --> 00:14:45,632
¤ So let's make this a walk to remember

192
00:14:47,080 --> 00:14:49,116
¤ There are stars in your way

193
00:14:49,160 --> 00:14:51,799
¤ From Amritsar to UK

194
00:14:51,840 --> 00:14:54,354
¤ There are stars in your way

¤ This is your moment, grab it

200

¤ Your wish is our command

201
00:15:09,920 --> 00:15:12,195
¤ We'll supply what you demand

¤ You've turned their lives around

203
00:15:15,240 --> 00:15:17,834
¤ You got a marriage into town

204
00:15:23,640 --> 00:15:26,029
¤ A marriage has come to town

205

¤ With a bad taste in their mouth

212
00:15:59,840 --> 00:16:02,274

¤ The guests won't leave without

214
00:16:10,560 --> 00:16:12,278
Look at that.

215
00:16:12,320 --> 00:16:13,355
Come on.

216
00:16:13,400 --> 00:16:14,389
Hurry up.

217
00:16:14,440 --> 00:16:15,589
Ha!

218
00:16:15,640 --> 00:16:20,191

(Hindu wedding ceremony)

254
00:19:45,800 --> 00:19:47,074
Hi, hi.

255
00:19:47,120 --> 00:19:48,678
They look sizzling, yeah?

256
00:19:48,720 --> 00:19:50,392
<i>Jaya should grab him right away.</i>

<i>Seduce him before he leaves,</i>

258
00:19:52,000 --> 00:19:55,515
give him a little taste
so he comes begging back for more.

259
00:19:55,560 --> 00:19:57,357
What makes you such an expert, huh?

260
00:19:58,120 --> 00:20:01,669
I know enough to know
that if that damn cute Darcy was looking at me

261
00:20:01,720 --> 00:20:04,518
the way he is looking at you now,
I wouldn't ignore him.

<i>LALITA: You're nuts, Chandra.</i>

Oh, God, is he coming now?

264
00:20:09,760 --> 00:20:11,159
- Lalita.
- Huh?

265
00:20:11,200 --> 00:20:12,315
Marry him.

266
00:20:12,360 --> 00:20:13,839
Divorce him right away.

267
00:20:13,880 --> 00:20:15,199
Then give me half.

268
00:20:15,240 --> 00:20:16,514
(Both laugh)

269
00:20:16,560 --> 00:20:18,710
Someone's having some fun up here.

270
00:20:18,760 --> 00:20:21,115
- It's not my tie, is it?
- No, we were just joking...

271
00:20:21,160 --> 00:20:23,515
- (Sneezes) Excuse me.
- Someone's thinking of you.

272
00:20:23,560 --> 00:20:25,551
I'm off to get a Coke. Bye.

273
00:20:26,880 --> 00:20:29,838
- What'd she say?
- Oh, it's just an old saying.

274
00:20:29,880 --> 00:20:32,952
We say whenever you sneeze,
it means someone's thinking of you.

275
00:20:34,040 --> 00:20:36,474
It's probably my lawyer.

276
00:20:36,520 --> 00:20:39,034
Can't get any work done in the hotel I'm in.

277
00:20:39,080 --> 00:20:41,548
- Which hotel's that?
- It's the DN International.

278
00:20:41,600 --> 00:20:43,511
That's the best hotel in town.

279
00:20:43,560 --> 00:20:44,675
Oh.

280
00:20:45,640 --> 00:20:48,677
Their computer system keeps crashing,
the electricity goes.

281
00:20:48,720 --> 00:20:50,711
I don't know how business functions here.

282
00:20:54,920 --> 00:20:57,229
Are you a barrister like Balraj?

283
00:20:57,280 --> 00:20:59,635
No, no, no.
My family's in the hotel business.

284
00:20:59,680 --> 00:21:01,796
I'm sure Amritsar's hotels can't compare,

285
00:21:01,840 --> 00:21:04,308
but I bet there's a slight price difference.

286
00:21:04,360 --> 00:21:07,079
How much does it cost
to stay in one of your hotels?

287
00:21:07,120 --> 00:21:10,032
A good room's about four,
five hundred dollars a night.

288
00:21:10,080 --> 00:21:12,674
That's more than what most people
make here in a year.

289
00:21:13,840 --> 00:21:16,035
Well, pretty bad when you put it like that.

290
00:21:16,840 --> 00:21:19,877
But, people who can afford it,
they want the best. It's...

291
00:21:20,680 --> 00:21:23,274
There's nothing wrong
with having standards, is there?

292
00:21:23,320 --> 00:21:26,039
No, as long as you don't impose them on others.

293
00:21:29,840 --> 00:21:33,469
- This is your first Indian wedding?
- Mmm, yeah.

294
00:21:34,520 --> 00:21:36,397
And it's been an experience.

295
00:21:36,440 --> 00:21:38,112
You're not enjoying it?

296
00:21:38,160 --> 00:21:42,358
No, no, I am. I just find the whole
arranged marriage thing a little strange.

297
00:21:42,400 --> 00:21:45,517
I don't know how two people can get married
that don't know each other.

298
00:21:45,560 --> 00:21:49,075
I mean, it's a little backward, don't you think?

299
00:21:49,120 --> 00:21:50,519
That's such a cliché.

300
00:21:50,560 --> 00:21:53,950
<i>It's different now.
It's more like a global dating service.</i>

301
00:21:54,000 --> 00:21:57,470
The groom looks pretty happy.
Did his parents force him into it?

302
00:21:58,480 --> 00:22:01,631
No, he asked his parents
to find him a bride, actually.

303
00:22:01,680 --> 00:22:03,511
He was busy running his company.

304
00:22:03,560 --> 00:22:07,838
- He just wanted it to be simple.
- I see, and so he came here.

305
00:22:07,880 --> 00:22:12,032
Is that what you think, too,
that India is the place to go for a simple woman?

306
00:22:14,440 --> 00:22:15,759
No, that's not what I meant.

307
00:22:15,800 --> 00:22:19,679
Americans think they've got the answers
for everything, including marriage.

308
00:22:19,720 --> 00:22:23,429
Pretty arrogant, considering they've got
the highest divorce rate in the world.

309
00:22:23,480 --> 00:22:26,711
What I was trying to say
is that he wanted a bride who was traditional.

310
00:22:26,760 --> 00:22:30,116
Darcy! Stop boring her to death
and come and get down with us.

311
00:22:35,520 --> 00:22:36,919
Listen, er...

312
00:22:37,880 --> 00:22:39,996
I'm a hopeless dancer, but...

313
00:22:40,040 --> 00:22:43,794
well, this looks like you just screw in
a light bulb with one hand,

314
00:22:43,840 --> 00:22:45,478
you pet the dog with the other.

315
00:22:45,520 --> 00:22:47,078
Will you teach me?

316
00:22:47,800 --> 00:22:49,518
You know what?

317
00:22:49,560 --> 00:22:52,154
I think you should find someone
simple and traditional

318
00:22:52,200 --> 00:22:54,191
to teach you to dance like the natives.

319
00:23:05,080 --> 00:23:07,071
(Chatter)

320
00:23:11,600 --> 00:23:13,397
We're all flying down to Goa tomorrow.

321
00:23:13,440 --> 00:23:15,556
Darcy's looking into a hotel he may acquire.

322
00:23:16,520 --> 00:23:18,033
<i>BALRAJ: Mr Bakshi,</i>

323
00:23:18,080 --> 00:23:20,230
we'd love for Jaya to join us as our guest.

324
00:23:20,280 --> 00:23:22,316
Oh, how nice, a hotel in Goa.

325
00:23:23,320 --> 00:23:26,995
Mr Balraj, I am not sure if it would be appropriate
to let Jaya go on her own.

326
00:23:27,040 --> 00:23:28,792
Oh, I understand.

327
00:23:28,840 --> 00:23:30,671
Don't be silly, dear.

328
00:23:30,720 --> 00:23:32,438
So kind of you to invite Jaya.

329
00:23:32,480 --> 00:23:34,311
Perhaps her sister can accompany her?

330
00:23:34,360 --> 00:23:37,272
- I think I can go to Goa.
- Lakhi, you're too young.

331
00:23:37,320 --> 00:23:40,437
- Lalita should accompany her sister.
- But, Papa...

332
00:23:40,480 --> 00:23:42,232
<i>MRS BAKSHI: Don't be a silly girl.</i>

333
00:23:42,280 --> 00:23:44,157
Go and have fun with your sister.

334
00:23:45,920 --> 00:23:48,115
Sure, I'd love to come with Jaya.

335
00:23:48,160 --> 00:23:51,072
<i>BALRAJ: Wonderful.
I'll send the driver over in the morning.</i>

336
00:23:51,120 --> 00:23:52,951
- Good night to you all.
- Thank you.

337
00:23:53,000 --> 00:23:54,956
- Good night.
- Goodbye.

338
00:23:55,000 --> 00:23:56,752
Good night.

339
00:23:56,800 --> 00:23:58,677
Have you gone crazy, old man?

340
00:23:58,720 --> 00:24:01,314
This is Jaya's chance to win him once and for all.

341
00:24:01,360 --> 00:24:03,316
And he'll get to see her in a swimsuit.

342
00:24:04,360 --> 00:24:05,679
Are you crazy?

343
00:24:15,760 --> 00:24:17,671
Hello.

344
00:24:17,720 --> 00:24:19,631
What's this?

345
00:24:20,680 --> 00:24:22,591
Thank you.

346
00:24:31,480 --> 00:24:33,391
- Sea Breeze.
- Oh, thanks.

347
00:24:40,320 --> 00:24:43,437
Darcy, darling, can you tear yourself
away from the love of your life

348
00:24:43,480 --> 00:24:46,631
and put some lotion on my back?
I don't want to get too dark.

349
00:24:46,680 --> 00:24:48,830
I'm writing to my little sister Georgie.

350
00:24:48,880 --> 00:24:50,836
Oh, my God!

351
00:24:50,880 --> 00:24:52,791
You lugged that all this way?

352
00:24:52,840 --> 00:24:55,832
That explains why you haven't got
much room for outfits.

353
00:24:55,880 --> 00:24:57,552
Do you have something against books?

354
00:24:57,600 --> 00:25:00,558
Or do you resent them
because they leave less room for make-up?

355
00:25:00,600 --> 00:25:02,397
No.

356
00:25:02,440 --> 00:25:04,351
No, I just never have time for them.

357
00:25:05,720 --> 00:25:07,756
Indians here have a lot more free time.

358
00:25:08,880 --> 00:25:12,077
Or maybe you're just a much more
accomplished woman than I am.

359
00:25:12,120 --> 00:25:14,076
Mm-hm. Maybe.

360
00:25:14,120 --> 00:25:15,838
(Darcy chuckles)

361
00:25:16,560 --> 00:25:18,471
Darcy's a great reader.

362
00:25:19,400 --> 00:25:23,712
In fact, I think a love of books
is on his list for his ideal woman.

363
00:25:23,760 --> 00:25:26,069
I think you've had one too many Sea Breezes.

364
00:25:26,120 --> 00:25:29,999
I remember a very drunken night in Oxford
when you recited the list.

365
00:25:30,040 --> 00:25:32,838
She has to be smart, speak several languages...

366
00:25:32,880 --> 00:25:34,552
All right, Kiran, drop it.

367
00:25:34,600 --> 00:25:37,319
No, I recall, she had to be athletic,

368
00:25:37,360 --> 00:25:39,555
voluptuous, of course,

369
00:25:39,600 --> 00:25:42,068
graceful, witty, confident...

370
00:25:42,120 --> 00:25:45,999
I'm not surprised Mr Darcy hasn't found
his ideal woman with a list like that.

371
00:25:46,040 --> 00:25:47,951
Does this mean you're an ideal man?

372
00:25:48,000 --> 00:25:51,151
(Laughs) I guess you'd be
a better judge of that than me.

373
00:25:51,200 --> 00:25:53,350
As far as I can tell, most men have faults.

374
00:25:53,400 --> 00:25:56,153
Arrogance, pride, vanity...

375
00:25:56,200 --> 00:25:58,634
She's certainly read you like a book, Darcy.

376
00:25:59,800 --> 00:26:01,711
No.

377
00:26:02,880 --> 00:26:04,791
I just think you got me all wrong.

378
00:26:04,840 --> 00:26:09,038
Well, you'd certainly have trouble
finding your ideal woman in India.

379
00:26:09,080 --> 00:26:13,039
I didn't hear "simple", "traditional",
"subservient" on your list.

380
00:26:13,080 --> 00:26:15,719
Come on, give me a break.
Now you're twisting my words.

381
00:26:15,760 --> 00:26:17,910
<i>You said yourself that you're used to the best.</i>

382
00:26:17,960 --> 00:26:20,030
I'm sure you think India's beneath you.

383
00:26:21,000 --> 00:26:22,877
If I really thought that,

384
00:26:22,920 --> 00:26:25,798
then why would I be thinking about
buying this place?

385
00:26:25,840 --> 00:26:27,558
(Laughs) You think this is India?

386
00:26:27,600 --> 00:26:30,398
Well, don't you wanna see more investment,
more jobs?

387
00:26:30,440 --> 00:26:32,158
<i>Yes, but who does it really benefit?</i>

388
00:26:32,880 --> 00:26:36,634
You want people to come to India
without having to deal with Indians.

389
00:26:36,680 --> 00:26:40,229
That's good. Remind me to add that
to the tourism brochure.

390
00:26:40,280 --> 00:26:44,159
Isn't that what all tourists want here?
5- star comfort with a bit of culture thrown in?

391
00:26:44,200 --> 00:26:46,475
I don't want you turning India into a theme park.

392
00:26:46,520 --> 00:26:48,988
I thought we got rid of imperialists like you.

393
00:26:49,040 --> 00:26:51,315
I'm not British. I'm American.

394
00:26:51,360 --> 00:26:53,271
Exactly.

395
00:27:36,480 --> 00:27:38,630
(Gentle guitar music)

396
00:28:08,160 --> 00:28:10,071
What the hell's he doing here?

397
00:28:11,080 --> 00:28:12,513
Oh, my God.

398
00:28:30,400 --> 00:28:31,719
Hello.

399
00:28:32,360 --> 00:28:35,113
¤ Enter in the dance
Plug it in an' we begin

400
00:28:35,160 --> 00:28:37,037
¤ Crowd up in the centre

401
00:28:37,080 --> 00:28:38,991
¤ They watch be dibidim

402
00:28:39,040 --> 00:28:42,237
¤ Watch the way we drop it in a mix timing

403
00:28:42,600 --> 00:28:45,592
¤ Rise and amplifying
when we come in with the swing

404
00:28:46,160 --> 00:28:49,038
¤ Just following the back
an' naturally harmonisin'

405
00:28:49,720 --> 00:28:52,951
¤ Climb into position
with synchronised things

406
00:28:53,520 --> 00:28:56,432
¤ Live from out the ghetto we maximisin'

407
00:28:57,000 --> 00:29:00,197
¤ Sound of the Groove Armada,

408
00:29:05,480 --> 00:29:07,391
¤ We superstylin'...

409
00:29:16,000 --> 00:29:17,911
- Hello again.
- Hi.

410
00:29:18,480 --> 00:29:21,392
- How are you?
- Fine. Thanks.

411
00:29:21,440 --> 00:29:23,795
- Can I join you?
- Sure.

412
00:29:23,840 --> 00:29:27,116
- Would you like a drink?
- No, thanks. I'm not much of a drinker.

413
00:29:27,160 --> 00:29:30,072
Neither am I. I only drink here
cos it's cheaper than the water.

414
00:29:31,760 --> 00:29:33,671
I'm Johnny, by the way.

415
00:29:33,720 --> 00:29:35,312
Johnny Wickham.

416
00:29:35,360 --> 00:29:37,590
Pleased to meet you, Johnny. I'm Lalita.

417
00:29:39,080 --> 00:29:40,991
Lalita.

418
00:29:43,080 --> 00:29:44,877
How do you know Will Darcy?

419
00:29:44,920 --> 00:29:46,831
I saw you two blank each other.

420
00:29:48,680 --> 00:29:51,319
<i>I was going to go over and say hi to the guy,</i>

421
00:29:51,360 --> 00:29:54,033
but then I realised I'd have to talk to the wanker.

422
00:29:54,080 --> 00:29:55,877
<i>We sort of grew up together,</i>

423
00:29:55,920 --> 00:29:58,992
cos my mum used to work for Darcy's family
in England.

424
00:29:59,040 --> 00:30:00,951
She was his nanny.

425
00:30:01,000 --> 00:30:03,992
See, their family had a couple of
big old country hotels.

426
00:30:04,040 --> 00:30:05,951
Dad was a really keen golfer.

427
00:30:06,000 --> 00:30:08,275
Well, Darcy's dad was a really keen golfer.

428
00:30:08,320 --> 00:30:10,788
I used to caddy for him. Really nice old fella.

429
00:30:11,760 --> 00:30:16,675
Gave me a great job when I left school,
and I don't know, Darcy was never too keen.

430
00:30:18,400 --> 00:30:20,311
<i>So when the old man died a few years back,</i>

431
00:30:20,360 --> 00:30:23,113
you can guess who was the first one to get fired.

432
00:30:23,160 --> 00:30:24,798
What, just like that?

433
00:30:24,840 --> 00:30:27,434
With his dad gone,
he didn't have to explain, did he?

434
00:30:27,480 --> 00:30:29,357
But your mum helped raise him.

435
00:30:29,400 --> 00:30:31,072
Yes, she did.

436
00:30:31,120 --> 00:30:33,714
You know, Darcy's mum
is even worse than he is.

437
00:30:34,360 --> 00:30:36,715
She's been trying to get him hitched to this...

438
00:30:36,760 --> 00:30:38,352
this rich New York girl for years.

439
00:30:38,400 --> 00:30:40,038
It's the ultimate business merger.

440
00:30:40,080 --> 00:30:42,310
So she's arranging his marriage?

441
00:30:43,200 --> 00:30:45,953
- You could call it that, yeah.
- What a hypocrite.

442
00:30:50,840 --> 00:30:53,434
See, that's the great thing about living in India.

443
00:30:53,480 --> 00:30:56,074
You don't have to have money
to enjoy this place,

444
00:30:56,120 --> 00:31:00,671
and if you have money, you never get
to see the real India, you know?

445
00:31:01,720 --> 00:31:05,110
I just feel like people here
have got their priorities sorted.

446
00:31:06,480 --> 00:31:08,391
I'd love for you to come to Amritsar.

447
00:31:08,440 --> 00:31:10,351
It's... It's beautiful.

448
00:31:12,000 --> 00:31:14,195
It's just that not many tourists go there.

449
00:31:15,080 --> 00:31:16,991
Am... Amritsar?

450
00:31:17,040 --> 00:31:19,508
Is that where the Golden Temple is?

451
00:31:20,800 --> 00:31:22,711
Yeah.

452
00:31:23,400 --> 00:31:27,075
I'm sorry we're leaving today,
but I'd love to show you my home town.

453
00:31:27,120 --> 00:31:29,111
Yeah, I'd love to show you London.

454
00:31:30,840 --> 00:31:33,115
¤ My eyes are searching

455
00:31:33,160 --> 00:31:35,628

00:32:35,200 --> 00:32:37,111
¤ My lips are waiting
Take me to love

471
00:32:39,000 --> 00:32:42,675
¤ Oh! Whoa-oh!

472
00:32:43,480 --> 00:32:46,153
¤ Take me

473
00:32:46,200 --> 00:32:49,510
¤ Take me to love

474
00:32:49,560 --> 00:32:51,471
¤ To love

475
00:32:58,400 --> 00:33:00,311
(Cheering and applause)

476
00:33:05,600 --> 00:33:07,875
- (Fireworks exploding)
- Oh, my God!

477
00:33:16,000 --> 00:33:18,150
<i>MRS BAKSHI: Hurry up, Bijili. And be careful!</i>

478
00:33:18,200 --> 00:33:20,111
Oh!

479
00:33:21,960 --> 00:33:24,474
<i>- Ah, you're back.
- What's going on, Lakhi?</i>

480
00:33:24,520 --> 00:33:25,953
Everything OK?

481
00:33:26,000 --> 00:33:27,911
- Yes, Mama, it was lovely.
- Good.

482
00:33:27,960 --> 00:33:31,714
Now one is all but taken care of,
we have to prepare for Number 2.

483
00:33:31,760 --> 00:33:33,751
<i>- What?
- Maya, hurry up with the bucket!</i>

484
00:33:33,800 --> 00:33:35,597
He'll be here soon.

485
00:33:35,640 --> 00:33:38,552
- Who? Who, Mama?
- Don't ask me.

486
00:33:38,600 --> 00:33:40,636
Kholi saab. He's on his way from the airport.

487
00:33:40,680 --> 00:33:42,193
- Who?
- Kholi.

488
00:33:42,240 --> 00:33:46,597
He's your father's sister's husband's sister's son.
And he's a top accountant in California.

489
00:33:46,640 --> 00:33:48,631
But why is he coming here?

490
00:33:48,680 --> 00:33:51,114
To look at me for his bride. What do you think?

491
00:33:52,320 --> 00:33:54,231
(Horn beeps)

492
00:33:56,520 --> 00:33:59,273
Hurry up, girls, come on here.
I want to look at you.

493
00:33:59,320 --> 00:34:01,276
Hurry up, hurry up. Come on, fast.

494
00:34:01,320 --> 00:34:03,470
Now, listen to me carefully, girls, huh.

495
00:34:03,520 --> 00:34:07,274
It's very important to make a good
first impression on Kholi saab.

496
00:34:07,320 --> 00:34:09,629
Stand straight... smile...

497
00:34:10,360 --> 00:34:12,828
...don't talk unnecessarily,

498
00:34:12,880 --> 00:34:15,678
and don't say anything too intelligent. You!

499
00:34:15,720 --> 00:34:18,393
Shame she only selectively practises
what she preaches.

500
00:34:18,440 --> 00:34:20,749
Why don't you go outside
and welcome the guest?

501
00:34:20,800 --> 00:34:21,869
I'll do that.

502
00:34:21,920 --> 00:34:24,354
Bijili, go outside and get the luggage.

503
00:34:24,400 --> 00:34:26,311
Mamaji! Whassup!

504
00:34:28,000 --> 00:34:29,911
Hello. How are you?

505
00:34:31,080 --> 00:34:33,230
Yes, madam, no problem. Bijili is here.

506
00:34:33,280 --> 00:34:35,191
Go outside, you bloody fool.

507
00:34:36,920 --> 00:34:38,831
Hey, hey! Eurgh!

508
00:34:39,600 --> 00:34:41,113
<i>MR BAKSHl: Bijili.</i>

509
00:34:41,160 --> 00:34:43,151
- Oh.
- Hey!

510
00:34:43,200 --> 00:34:45,555
Come in, Kholi saab. Welcome.

511
00:34:45,600 --> 00:34:47,511
We weren't expecting you so early.

512
00:34:47,560 --> 00:34:49,471
You've really taken us by surprise.

513
00:34:49,520 --> 00:34:52,876
What a pleasure to see you, Mamaji,
after so long time.

514
00:34:55,200 --> 00:34:57,350
Oh. Oh, ho.

515
00:34:57,400 --> 00:34:59,709
Oh, of course. You remember my daughters.

516
00:35:00,320 --> 00:35:02,914
Jaya, Lalita,

517
00:35:02,960 --> 00:35:05,315
Maya and Lakhi.

518
00:35:05,360 --> 00:35:07,032
Oh!

519
00:35:07,080 --> 00:35:11,437
From small great caterpillars
to such beautiful b-butterflies.

520
00:35:13,200 --> 00:35:18,228
- And so like you... Madame Butterfly.
(Mr Bakshi coughs)

521
00:35:19,800 --> 00:35:21,518
This is my dream home.

522
00:35:21,560 --> 00:35:22,788
Colonial style.

523
00:35:22,840 --> 00:35:25,912
Five bedrooms, three and a half bathrooms,

524
00:35:25,960 --> 00:35:28,758
$850,000.

525
00:35:29,480 --> 00:35:32,392
- That's four crores, 25 lakhs.
- Oh, my.

526
00:35:32,440 --> 00:35:33,998
I bought it only six months ago.

527
00:35:34,040 --> 00:35:36,759
It's already worth $900,000.

528
00:35:36,800 --> 00:35:38,870
I bet it has three swimming pools.

529
00:35:41,640 --> 00:35:45,679
Actually, the complex has two pools,
er, plus my crib.

530
00:35:47,520 --> 00:35:50,398
It has its own hot-tub bath with super-jets.

531
00:35:51,440 --> 00:35:53,078
It's the bomb.

532
00:35:54,040 --> 00:35:57,316
Is it near Beverly Hills 9-zero-2-1-zero?

533
00:35:57,360 --> 00:35:58,713
<i>No.</i>

534
00:35:58,760 --> 00:36:00,557
No, it's in the valley.

535
00:36:00,600 --> 00:36:04,275
Er, but 20 minutes down 101 Freeway,
and you're in North Hollywood.

536
00:36:05,040 --> 00:36:06,473
Did you hear that, Lalita?

537
00:36:06,520 --> 00:36:08,556
He lives in Hollywood.

538
00:36:08,600 --> 00:36:10,158
You must join me in US.

539
00:36:10,200 --> 00:36:12,395
You must, you must, you must. Eh?

540
00:36:12,440 --> 00:36:16,149
I could help you start a business there.
That's where the money's to be made.

541
00:36:16,200 --> 00:36:18,589
UK's finished, India's too corrupt.

542
00:36:18,640 --> 00:36:22,349
Kholi saab, India is still a young country
since Independence.

543
00:36:22,400 --> 00:36:24,550
I hardly think its potential is over.

544
00:36:24,600 --> 00:36:27,478
What do you think your US was like
after 60 years of independence?

545
00:36:27,520 --> 00:36:30,796
They were killing each other with slavery
and blindly searching for gold.

546
00:36:37,840 --> 00:36:41,150
I tell you, boss, I've made a packet
as an accountant in LA.

547
00:36:41,200 --> 00:36:44,078
You know, the Indian community there
is very professional,

548
00:36:44,120 --> 00:36:47,078
all doctors and computers and...

549
00:36:47,120 --> 00:36:52,433
not like these uneducated
minicab/7-Eleven store types.

550
00:36:52,480 --> 00:36:54,516
<i>It's ours for the taking.</i>

551
00:36:54,560 --> 00:36:56,630
Anyone can become an American.

552
00:36:56,680 --> 00:36:59,956
Then... why come back here?

553
00:37:00,000 --> 00:37:02,355
<i>Ah... ba da bing, ba da boom.</i>

554
00:37:02,400 --> 00:37:03,719
"Ba da bing, ba da boom"?

555
00:37:03,760 --> 00:37:05,716
There's only one problem with America.

556
00:37:06,840 --> 00:37:08,910
Our girls that are born there,

557
00:37:08,960 --> 00:37:11,269
they've totally lost their roots.

558
00:37:11,320 --> 00:37:13,436
<i>Completely clueless.</i>

559
00:37:13,480 --> 00:37:15,675
Our girls are very rooted.

560
00:37:15,720 --> 00:37:18,837
They're really very, very traditional, huh?

561
00:37:19,800 --> 00:37:21,199
You know, in US,

562
00:37:21,240 --> 00:37:24,437
<i>they're all too outspoken and career-orientated.</i>

563
00:37:24,480 --> 00:37:28,519
And some have even turned into...

564
00:37:29,800 --> 00:37:31,119
...the lesbian.

565
00:37:31,160 --> 00:37:32,559
(Giggling)

566
00:37:32,600 --> 00:37:34,989
<i>- (Clears throat)
- So that leaves me no choice.</i>

567
00:37:35,040 --> 00:37:38,396
I may be healthy, wealthy and wise,

568
00:37:38,440 --> 00:37:43,150
but as they say, "no life... without wife".

569
00:37:45,600 --> 00:37:47,556
Kholi saab.

570
00:37:48,480 --> 00:37:49,993
You're a poet as well.

571
00:37:51,120 --> 00:37:53,270
<i>Did you hear that, Mr Bakshi? Huh?</i>

572
00:37:53,320 --> 00:37:55,914
<i>- No life without wife.
- Yes.</i>

573
00:37:55,960 --> 00:37:57,996
Very wisely spoken.

574
00:37:58,040 --> 00:38:00,998
I think God is smiling down on me.

575
00:38:01,040 --> 00:38:03,474
I'm spoilt for choice in this house.

576
00:38:03,520 --> 00:38:06,717
<i>I suppose, as the eldest...</i>

577
00:38:08,600 --> 00:38:10,318
...Jaya must be the first choice.

578
00:38:10,360 --> 00:38:13,909
Actually... er, Kholi saab...

579
00:38:13,960 --> 00:38:17,873
Jaya is practically engaged to someone else.

580
00:38:17,920 --> 00:38:18,989
<i>Oh.</i>

581
00:38:19,040 --> 00:38:22,430
Er, b-b-but, er, Lalita is unspoken for.

582
00:38:23,480 --> 00:38:24,833
La-Lalita.

583
00:38:30,280 --> 00:38:31,952
Lalita.

584
00:38:34,960 --> 00:38:37,394
¤ Lonely Mr Kholi from Los Angeles

585
00:38:37,800 --> 00:38:40,075
¤ Came to Punjab on one bent knee

586
00:38:40,120 --> 00:38:42,714
¤ He had a Green Card, new house, big cash

587
00:38:43,040 --> 00:38:45,474
¤ Still made a wish with every fallen lash

588
00:38:45,520 --> 00:38:47,556
¤ For you to do the journey with him

589
00:38:47,600 --> 00:38:50,194
¤ To smile when he got home,
ask how his day had been

590
00:38:50,240 --> 00:38:52,515
¤ He wants you by his side, in joy and strife

591
00:38:52,560 --> 00:38:54,471
¤ Poor Mr Kholi

592
00:38:54,520 --> 00:38:57,671
¤ He has no life without wife

593
00:38:57,720 --> 00:38:58,994
¤ No life

594
00:38:59,960 --> 00:39:01,279
¤ Without wife

595
00:39:03,160 --> 00:39:06,232

¤ Oh, yeah-yeah yeah

600
00:39:17,880 --> 00:39:20,394
¤ I don't want a man who ties me down

601
00:39:20,440 --> 00:39:22,795
¤ Does what he wants while I hang around

602
00:39:22,840 --> 00:39:25,434
¤ I don't want a man who's crude and loud

603
00:39:25,480 --> 00:39:27,630
¤ Who wants a pretty wife to make him proud

604
00:39:27,680 --> 00:39:30,194
¤ I don't want a man who can't be funny

605

¤ Tells tall tales about making money

606
00:39:32,600 --> 00:39:34,318
¤ Oh, yeah

607
00:39:35,200 --> 00:39:39,273
¤ I don't want a man who'll grab the best seat

608
00:39:40,440 --> 00:39:43,830
¤ Can't close his mouth when he starts to eat

609
00:39:45,440 --> 00:39:49,228
¤ I don't want a man who likes to drink

610
00:39:50,200 --> 00:39:54,193
¤ Or leaves his dirty dishes in the sink

611

¤ I don't want a man who wants his mummy

612

¤ A balding pest with too much tummy

613

¤ I don't want a man who's dead in the head

¤ I just want a man not scared to weep

640

¤ To hold me close when we're asleep

641

¤ Oh, yeah

642

¤ I just want a man who loves romance

643
00:41:27,520 --> 00:41:31,479
¤ Will clear the floor and ask me to dance

644
00:41:32,800 --> 00:41:35,155
¤ I just want a man who gives some back

645

¤ Who talks to me and not my rack

646

¤ I just want a man whose spirit is free

647

¤ To be an overseas bride dressed in white

663

¤ To have a little home in the country

(Screams)

666
00:43:40,880 --> 00:43:42,359
Come, come.

667
00:43:42,400 --> 00:43:43,799
Thank you.

668
00:43:45,240 --> 00:43:46,878
Yes?

669
00:43:46,920 --> 00:43:48,558
Um, nameste gee.

670
00:43:48,600 --> 00:43:52,070
Er, I came to see Lalita. I'm friends with her.

671
00:43:52,120 --> 00:43:53,838
Friends?

672
00:43:53,880 --> 00:43:55,313
Yes.

673
00:43:56,520 --> 00:43:57,839
Lalita!

674
00:43:57,880 --> 00:43:59,996
<i>LALITA: Yes, Mama.</i>

675
00:44:00,040 --> 00:44:02,679
- Oh, hi.
- Hi.

676
00:44:02,720 --> 00:44:03,914
- You made it.
- Yeah.

677
00:44:03,960 --> 00:44:05,598
- Come in.
- Thank you.

678
00:44:05,640 --> 00:44:07,870
- How was your journey?
- Great. Thank you.

679
00:44:07,920 --> 00:44:09,433
- Hello, Johnny.
- Hi, Jaya.

680
00:44:09,480 --> 00:44:11,152
<i>- How are you?
- Yeah.</i>

681
00:44:11,200 --> 00:44:13,555
Papa, this is our friend from Goa.

682
00:44:13,600 --> 00:44:16,478
- Johnny Wickham. He's from London.
- Chaman Bakshi.

683
00:44:16,520 --> 00:44:18,795
Oh, pleased to meet you. Johnny Wickham.

684
00:44:18,840 --> 00:44:20,751
He wanted to see the Golden Temple.

685
00:44:20,800 --> 00:44:23,951
So, do you think he could stay with us, Papa?
Please?

686
00:44:24,000 --> 00:44:27,151
Yes, of course.
We can do with some fresh conversation here.

687
00:44:27,200 --> 00:44:28,758
I'll show you the guest room.

688
00:44:28,800 --> 00:44:30,313
Thank you very much, Mr Bakshi.

689
00:44:30,360 --> 00:44:32,032
Mrs Bakshi.

690
00:44:33,200 --> 00:44:36,237
- Oh, God, he's too yum.
- Sshh, he'll hear you.

691
00:44:36,280 --> 00:44:39,829
He cannot stay here.
Hippies are dirty and they steal.

692
00:44:39,880 --> 00:44:41,677
<i>LALITA: Mama, he's not a hippy.</i>

693
00:44:41,720 --> 00:44:43,711
And what will Kholi saab say?

694
00:44:43,760 --> 00:44:46,672
He is staying here
in a house full of young unmarried women?

695
00:44:46,720 --> 00:44:49,712
Mr Kholi's been in the house a day
and is already running things?

696
00:44:49,760 --> 00:44:52,149
We can take him to the Garbha tonight.
No, Mama?

697
00:44:52,200 --> 00:44:55,158
Lalita, please may I have
the first dance with him?

698
00:44:55,200 --> 00:44:56,679
See what you've started.

699
00:44:56,720 --> 00:44:59,154
Don't be ridiculous.
He cannot come to the Garbha.

700
00:44:59,200 --> 00:45:01,953
But, Mama, there's never enough
cute boys to dance with.

701
00:45:02,000 --> 00:45:03,672
<i>Have you all gone mad?</i>

702
00:45:03,720 --> 00:45:06,359
What will Balraj think of us
if we all land up there with him?

703
00:45:06,400 --> 00:45:07,549
It's really unfair.

704
00:45:07,600 --> 00:45:08,749
What's unfair?

705
00:45:08,800 --> 00:45:11,314
Papa, she will not have our friend
come to the Garbha.

706
00:45:11,360 --> 00:45:13,669
Of course he should come
and see Garbha with us.

707
00:45:13,720 --> 00:45:15,278
I just invited him.

708
00:45:16,760 --> 00:45:19,069
This is really a madhouse.

709
00:45:25,120 --> 00:45:28,317
I'm so glad he's come.
I really didn't think he'd make it.

710
00:45:28,360 --> 00:45:30,237
I can't wait to see Balraj.

711
00:45:30,280 --> 00:45:33,078
I wish he didn't have to bring
that Darcy with him.

712
00:45:33,120 --> 00:45:35,236
There's one thing I don't quite understand.

713
00:45:37,040 --> 00:45:41,795
If Darcy is Balraj's best friend,
he can't be as awful as Johnny thinks he is.

714
00:45:41,840 --> 00:45:45,071
Jaya, you look absolutely beautiful.

715
00:45:46,920 --> 00:45:49,195
And, Lalita, you look nice too.

716
00:45:49,240 --> 00:45:50,992
<i>You've really made an effort tonight.</i>

717
00:45:51,040 --> 00:45:54,191
No doubt you had certain someone in mind.

718
00:45:55,800 --> 00:45:58,075
Hey, mastered the Garbha already?

719
00:45:58,120 --> 00:46:00,395
Ah, no, I can only hope and pray, really.

720
00:46:00,440 --> 00:46:03,512
But um, Lakhi's a great teacher, though.
Really good.

721
00:46:03,560 --> 00:46:06,028
<i>LAKHI: His Garbha style is killing, man.</i>

722
00:46:06,080 --> 00:46:09,038
- Jaya, they're here. Quickly. Move, please.
- Sorry.

723
00:46:09,080 --> 00:46:10,832
- Don't worry.
- Lakhi.

724
00:46:12,520 --> 00:46:15,478
I'm so sorry about my mother.
She can be a little abrupt.

725
00:46:15,520 --> 00:46:17,317
There's no need to apologise.

726
00:46:17,360 --> 00:46:18,952
I appreciate her letting me stay.

727
00:46:20,360 --> 00:46:22,112
I'm so glad you came.

728
00:46:22,160 --> 00:46:24,435
You couldn't come to India and not see Amritsar.

729
00:46:24,480 --> 00:46:26,198
<i>No, you, you were right.</i>

730
00:46:26,960 --> 00:46:28,916
It's very beautiful.

731
00:46:30,360 --> 00:46:32,749
<i>LALITA: You sure you're ready for this?</i>

732
00:46:32,800 --> 00:46:34,313
I'm willing to take the risk.

733
00:46:34,360 --> 00:46:35,839
- Well...
- Hello.

734
00:46:35,880 --> 00:46:37,757
Oh, hi. Hi. Hey, there, buddy.

735
00:46:37,800 --> 00:46:39,756
Hi, buddy, how are you?

736
00:46:39,800 --> 00:46:41,995
Madam, would you do me the honour?

737
00:46:42,040 --> 00:46:44,679
You know, actually, I prefer American hip-hop,

738
00:46:44,720 --> 00:46:47,314
but as Gloria Estefan says,

739
00:46:47,360 --> 00:46:49,396
"The rhythm is going to get you. "

740
00:46:50,440 --> 00:46:52,351
So, bring it on.

741
00:46:53,200 --> 00:46:55,111
(Dramatic drumbeats)

742
00:47:25,800 --> 00:47:27,358
(Singing in Gujarati)

743
00:47:53,800 --> 00:47:55,472
- Hi.
- Hi.

744
00:47:56,440 --> 00:47:58,954
You look like you were working hard out there.

745
00:47:59,000 --> 00:48:00,911
Hey, there, partner.

746
00:48:00,960 --> 00:48:02,473
This is Mr Kholi.

747
00:48:02,520 --> 00:48:04,954
And this is my best friend, Chandra Lamba.

748
00:48:07,520 --> 00:48:11,798
It's such a great pleasure to meet
yet another beautiful young lady.

749
00:48:12,800 --> 00:48:15,758
There must be something magical
in the water in Amritsar.

750
00:48:15,800 --> 00:48:17,791
I'd happily get drunk on it.

751
00:48:17,840 --> 00:48:19,478
(Giggles nervously)

752
00:48:19,520 --> 00:48:23,433
Please, er, can I have the honour of
getting you ladies a... a soft drink?

753
00:48:23,480 --> 00:48:24,959
- Yes, please.
- Oh.

754
00:48:25,000 --> 00:48:26,513
- Thank you.
- Oh.

755
00:48:29,000 --> 00:48:33,073
Oh, my God, I thought he was going to
put you in hospital out there.

756
00:48:33,120 --> 00:48:34,519
Try eating with him.

757
00:48:34,560 --> 00:48:37,199
It's like looking at a Jackson Pollock painting.

758
00:48:38,400 --> 00:48:41,915
So... Jaya told me you met someone in Goa.

759
00:48:41,960 --> 00:48:43,598
Maybe.

760
00:48:43,640 --> 00:48:47,189
So Mr Darcy didn't manage to seduce
the jewel of Amritsar?

761
00:48:47,240 --> 00:48:50,232
Please, he's such a conceited, arrogant...

762
00:48:50,280 --> 00:48:51,599
<i>DARC Y: Hello, Lalita.</i>

763
00:48:53,560 --> 00:48:54,788
H- hello.

764
00:48:54,840 --> 00:48:56,273
- H-hi.
- Hi.

765
00:48:57,240 --> 00:48:59,879
I've been studying this Garbha thing.

766
00:49:01,280 --> 00:49:03,953
It's a little out of my league, but what the hell?

767
00:49:04,960 --> 00:49:06,359
Would you like to dance?

768
00:49:07,960 --> 00:49:08,995
(Mouths)

769
00:49:12,320 --> 00:49:13,878
Sure.

770
00:49:23,560 --> 00:49:25,073
Lalita?

771
00:49:25,120 --> 00:49:26,951
She... She...

772
00:49:34,920 --> 00:49:37,878
I believe we're coming to your house
for dinner tomorrow night.

773
00:49:37,920 --> 00:49:40,195
Balraj said your father invited us all.

774
00:49:40,240 --> 00:49:43,915
Can't wait.
Surprised to see your old friend Johnny?

775
00:49:45,800 --> 00:49:48,598
I wasn't so much surprised as disappointed.

776
00:49:48,640 --> 00:49:50,517
He's staying with us.

777
00:49:50,560 --> 00:49:52,676
My family really like him.

778
00:49:53,880 --> 00:49:55,916
Oh, yeah, everyone loves Wickham.

779
00:49:56,800 --> 00:49:59,758
He makes friends easily,
but he loses them just as quickly.

780
00:49:59,800 --> 00:50:02,837
And what about you?
Are you a loyal friend?

781
00:50:02,880 --> 00:50:05,030
What are you talking about?

782
00:50:05,080 --> 00:50:07,355
I've heard so many things about you, Darcy.

783
00:50:07,400 --> 00:50:08,879
I can't seem to figure you out.

784
00:50:09,880 --> 00:50:12,519
Maybe you shouldn't listen
to everything you hear.

785
00:50:12,560 --> 00:50:14,198
You should talk.

786
00:50:14,240 --> 00:50:17,232
After all the rubbish you said
about arranged marriages,

787
00:50:17,280 --> 00:50:20,317
I can't believe your mother's arranging yours.

788
00:50:22,600 --> 00:50:25,034
May I have this dance, Madam Bakshi?

789
00:50:25,080 --> 00:50:27,230
I thought you'd never ask.

790
00:50:27,280 --> 00:50:29,236
Shall we, er...?

791
00:51:00,640 --> 00:51:02,949
(Laughs)

792
00:51:06,720 --> 00:51:08,472
(Cheering)

793
00:51:15,400 --> 00:51:18,312
<i>MRS BAKSHI: Lalita! Bijili!</i>

794
00:51:18,360 --> 00:51:20,157
Where is my china?

795
00:51:20,200 --> 00:51:23,988
I'm sorry about this stupid dinner tonight.
I... I wanted you to join us.

796
00:51:24,040 --> 00:51:25,951
Don't worry about it. I'm used to it.

797
00:51:27,640 --> 00:51:29,676
Still, I wish you could come.

798
00:51:29,720 --> 00:51:32,188
It would make this evening a lot less boring.

799
00:51:36,200 --> 00:51:38,509
Ah, there you are!

800
00:51:38,560 --> 00:51:40,676
I've been looking for you everywhere.

801
00:51:40,720 --> 00:51:42,233
Where have you been?

802
00:51:42,280 --> 00:51:45,192
Lakhi's decided
she wants to show me the town tonight.

803
00:51:45,240 --> 00:51:50,109
I'm going to take him for Amritsari fish,
fruit cream and hot gulab jamans.

804
00:51:50,160 --> 00:51:51,673
That's nice.

805
00:51:51,720 --> 00:51:54,598
- Why are you looking? Look at me.
MRS BAKSHI: Bring my china!

806
00:51:54,640 --> 00:51:56,437
<i>- Stop it. What?
- Chelo, Bijili.</i>

807
00:51:56,480 --> 00:51:58,152
<i>Bring the ones which are not chipped.</i>

808
00:51:58,200 --> 00:51:59,349
Don't.

809
00:51:59,400 --> 00:52:01,118
I'm warning you.

810
00:52:07,800 --> 00:52:09,870
The Cobra dance.

811
00:53:34,840 --> 00:53:36,717
Thank you.

812
00:53:37,680 --> 00:53:39,398
That was lovely, Maya.

813
00:53:40,360 --> 00:53:43,158
- Papa, shall I play the sitar now?
- That's all right, Maya.

814
00:53:43,200 --> 00:53:45,873
You have entertained us enough
for the evening. Thank you.

815
00:53:45,920 --> 00:53:47,638
<i>Very good.</i>

816
00:53:50,080 --> 00:53:54,790
I still can't believe I'm sitting with a Darcy
in Amritsar of all places.

817
00:53:54,840 --> 00:53:58,037
- This world is too small, no, dude?
- Way too small.

818
00:53:58,080 --> 00:54:03,393
Lalita, my firm has been doing business
for many years with Darcy's mother,

819
00:54:03,440 --> 00:54:06,079
Ms Catherine, beautiful lady.

820
00:54:06,120 --> 00:54:09,192
- She has a such big hotel in Beverly Hills.
- Can I get anyone a drink?

821
00:54:09,240 --> 00:54:10,992
<i>- Me, please.
- Yes, please.</i>

822
00:54:11,040 --> 00:54:12,393
Let me help you with that.

823
00:54:14,320 --> 00:54:17,676
Why don't you all have something?
Balraj, have something.

824
00:54:17,720 --> 00:54:19,631
I saw you dance with Wickham,

825
00:54:19,680 --> 00:54:21,989
and I hear from Darcy
that he's staying with you.

826
00:54:22,040 --> 00:54:23,439
Yeah.

827
00:54:23,480 --> 00:54:24,879
So?

828
00:54:25,600 --> 00:54:28,398
Don't fall for his bullshit.
He's more trouble than he looks.

829
00:54:28,440 --> 00:54:30,476
His mother was Darcy's nanny, therefore...

830
00:54:30,520 --> 00:54:31,919
And you're Darcy's friend.

831
00:54:31,960 --> 00:54:34,190
Of course you'd take his side, wouldn't you?

832
00:54:34,240 --> 00:54:36,549
There's no crime in being the son of a servant.

833
00:54:38,640 --> 00:54:43,077
I have heard so many stories about
your Mr Darcy saab in Goa, Balraj.

834
00:54:43,120 --> 00:54:46,795
Mmm, let's just say that Darcy and India
have had a little bit of a rough time.

835
00:54:46,840 --> 00:54:50,628
Ah, these Indians,
they don't know how to treat tourists.

836
00:54:50,680 --> 00:54:53,672
- There's no sophistication.
- What do you mean "these Indians"?

837
00:54:53,720 --> 00:54:57,349
- Are you no longer an Indian?
- I'm a Green Card holder now.

838
00:54:57,400 --> 00:54:59,994
India is decades behind.

839
00:55:00,040 --> 00:55:02,918
<i>DARC Y: Oh, I think there is a lot about India
that we don't have.</i>

840
00:55:02,960 --> 00:55:04,359
Oh, really? Like what?

841
00:55:09,400 --> 00:55:13,359
Well, I think it's nice the way the families,
um, come together.

842
00:55:14,320 --> 00:55:15,719
I lost my father a while back

843
00:55:15,760 --> 00:55:18,354
and my mum spends a lot of her time
in New York,

844
00:55:18,400 --> 00:55:21,119
<i>so, my sister and I,
we don't really have a family home.</i>

845
00:55:21,160 --> 00:55:23,549
And I can't remember the last time
that all my family

846
00:55:23,600 --> 00:55:25,716
kind of got together like this.

847
00:55:25,760 --> 00:55:29,548
Oh, Kholi saab is only trying
to win over my daughters.

848
00:55:29,600 --> 00:55:34,594
Yes, he wants them to be in love
with America as much as he is.

849
00:55:34,640 --> 00:55:36,835
And why is that?

850
00:55:36,880 --> 00:55:40,031
<i>Well, you can see for yourself, Mr Darcy,</i>

851
00:55:40,080 --> 00:55:44,631
they are all exceptional marriageable prospects
for any single young man.

852
00:55:44,680 --> 00:55:48,070
<i>MR BAKSHl: I hope you brought big appetites.</i>

853
00:55:48,120 --> 00:55:50,714
Mrs Bakshi has planned a special feast
for all of us.

854
00:55:50,760 --> 00:55:55,117
The truth is that Kholi saab
was quite taken by Jaya at first,

855
00:55:55,160 --> 00:55:58,914
but after I explained to him
that she was being coveted

856
00:55:58,960 --> 00:56:03,317
by another fine gentleman from abroad,
I then steered him towards Lalita.

857
00:56:05,400 --> 00:56:07,550
Balraj, you are a very lucky man.

858
00:56:07,600 --> 00:56:11,752
<i>Jaya's had many suitors before,
with her great beauty and fine figure,</i>

859
00:56:11,800 --> 00:56:14,439
<i>but none were good enough for her.</i>

860
00:56:14,480 --> 00:56:16,869
You two will make a fine couple

861
00:56:16,920 --> 00:56:19,229
and you will have no regrets
on your wedding night.

862
00:56:19,280 --> 00:56:21,396
(Only Mrs Bakshi and Kholi laugh)

863
00:56:27,640 --> 00:56:29,198
(Sings scale)

864
00:56:35,280 --> 00:56:38,272
<i>MRS BAKSHI: Lalita Beti!</i>

865
00:56:40,080 --> 00:56:43,709
Jaya, I need some help in the kitchen.

866
00:56:55,440 --> 00:56:56,714
Come, come.

867
00:56:57,680 --> 00:56:58,829
Come on.

868
00:57:06,760 --> 00:57:08,193
(Clattering)

869
00:57:13,680 --> 00:57:15,591
Phew.

870
00:57:15,640 --> 00:57:17,232
Power walking.

871
00:57:17,280 --> 00:57:20,192
It's so healthy. Everyone in LA is so healthy.

872
00:57:21,160 --> 00:57:23,549
They all like to exercise but not read.

873
00:57:23,600 --> 00:57:26,637
Oh, no, no.
There are great bookstores too, word up.

874
00:57:26,680 --> 00:57:28,671
There's nothing you can't find in LA.

875
00:57:29,560 --> 00:57:32,757
Nothing? You sure you don't miss
some things from here?

876
00:57:32,800 --> 00:57:36,236
Well, er, to be honest...

877
00:57:38,600 --> 00:57:41,717
...what I do miss most is companionship.

878
00:57:41,760 --> 00:57:45,469
You know, you can get very lonely
in such a big place and...

879
00:57:45,520 --> 00:57:46,635
and...

880
00:57:47,640 --> 00:57:49,517
Lalita, I like you.

881
00:57:50,320 --> 00:57:52,550
You're very peppy and bright,

882
00:57:52,600 --> 00:57:54,795
and I wanna marry you and bring you back.

883
00:57:54,840 --> 00:57:56,910
- I spoke to your mother...
- You spoke to her?

884
00:57:56,960 --> 00:57:58,678
Yes, she's very enthusiastic.

885
00:57:58,720 --> 00:58:01,871
I'm sorry,
you should have spoken to me first.

886
00:58:01,920 --> 00:58:03,512
I'm not ready to be married.

887
00:58:03,560 --> 00:58:06,279
I... I really can't accept.

888
00:58:06,320 --> 00:58:09,676
Well, Lalita, I'm offering
to take you to America, huh?

889
00:58:09,720 --> 00:58:12,154
You and your family will have no more worries.

890
00:58:15,080 --> 00:58:18,152
I could never be the kind of wife
that could make you happy.

891
00:58:19,440 --> 00:58:22,352
And I don't think
you could make me happy either.

892
00:58:24,080 --> 00:58:26,389
I work for some of the richest people in America.

893
00:58:26,440 --> 00:58:30,149
I have savings and bonds and stocks
and you wouldn't even have to work.

894
00:58:30,200 --> 00:58:31,599
But I like working.

895
00:58:31,640 --> 00:58:33,756
OK. OK. Oh...

896
00:58:33,800 --> 00:58:37,031
You know, you may never get
such a good offer like this one again.

897
00:58:38,040 --> 00:58:39,758
I'm sorry.

898
00:58:43,440 --> 00:58:46,318
It's too, too much tension for me now.

899
00:58:47,400 --> 00:58:50,153
<i>She is happy to let us all be ruined.</i>

900
00:58:51,080 --> 00:58:53,150
You must speak to her, old man.

901
00:58:53,200 --> 00:58:55,509
She wants love to be there from the beginning.

902
00:58:56,560 --> 00:58:59,836
Where was the love-shove
when we first got married, huh?

903
00:59:01,000 --> 00:59:05,516
Tell her. Tell her that you marry first,
then love grows.

904
00:59:07,040 --> 00:59:09,474
I'll never speak to her again if she refuses him.

905
00:59:10,800 --> 00:59:13,394
Lalita, do you understand
what your mother is saying?

906
00:59:14,600 --> 00:59:19,754
She is saying that she will never speak to you
again if you do not marry Kholi saab. No?

907
00:59:19,800 --> 00:59:20,869
Yes.

908
00:59:22,640 --> 00:59:25,996
And I will never speak to you again
if you... do.

909
00:59:26,040 --> 00:59:27,268
What?

910
00:59:31,640 --> 00:59:33,517
Oh, Kholi, Kholi saab.

911
00:59:33,560 --> 00:59:34,754
Where are you going?

912
00:59:34,800 --> 00:59:37,189
Listen to me, Kholi saab. Listen to me.

913
00:59:37,240 --> 00:59:39,515
Please don't leave like this. Kholi saab?

914
00:59:40,320 --> 00:59:41,548
Kholi saab?

915
00:59:41,600 --> 00:59:44,239
Kholi saab? Kholi saab, please listen to me.

916
00:59:44,280 --> 00:59:46,510
Oh, my God. Kholi saab, I'll talk to her.

917
00:59:46,560 --> 00:59:49,677
Just listen to me.
I'm sure she will understand, Khol...

918
00:59:49,720 --> 00:59:52,393
Oh, Jaya, Balraj is here.

919
00:59:53,560 --> 00:59:54,834
Kholi saab.

920
01:00:05,720 --> 01:00:08,393
- I thought you were leaving next week.
- I know, I'm sorry.

921
01:00:08,440 --> 01:00:11,512
I've just found out that I have to be
on the next flight back to London.

922
01:00:11,560 --> 01:00:13,437
<i>Some important business has come up.</i>

923
01:00:13,480 --> 01:00:15,198
- Hang on a sec.
- Where are you going?

924
01:00:15,240 --> 01:00:17,629
<i>Kiran and Darcy want to go home too, so...</i>

925
01:00:20,520 --> 01:00:21,839
Yeah.

926
01:00:22,800 --> 01:00:24,028
I understand.

927
01:00:24,920 --> 01:00:27,150
But I'll e-mail you as soon as I get back. OK?

928
01:00:30,800 --> 01:00:33,268
<i>Well, I... suppose I'd better go.</i>

929
01:00:34,240 --> 01:00:35,593
Everything OK?

930
01:00:39,400 --> 01:00:40,719
Bye.

931
01:01:04,240 --> 01:01:05,912
<i>LAKHI: Mama!</i>

932
01:01:05,960 --> 01:01:07,518
<i>Mama.</i>

933
01:01:07,560 --> 01:01:09,835
Mama, you won't believe
what has happened.

934
01:01:09,880 --> 01:01:12,155
Jaya, Lalita, come fast.
You won't believe this.

935
01:01:12,200 --> 01:01:13,599
<i>MR BAKSHl: What is wrong?</i>

936
01:01:13,640 --> 01:01:16,837
Papa, Kholi has proposed to Chandra Lamba.

937
01:01:16,880 --> 01:01:17,995
- What?
- What?

938
01:01:18,040 --> 01:01:22,272
- I bet she gave him two tight slaps.
- No, she said yes.

939
01:01:22,320 --> 01:01:23,799
And you know what?

940
01:01:23,840 --> 01:01:26,035
They're having a small temple ceremony here,

941
01:01:26,080 --> 01:01:28,799
and then a big American wedding in LA.

942
01:01:28,840 --> 01:01:30,478
No.

943
01:01:32,800 --> 01:01:35,633
LALITA: I can't believe
my best friend would do that.

944
01:01:35,680 --> 01:01:37,955
(Sobbing)

945
01:01:38,000 --> 01:01:41,197
One billion Indians and she had to marry
one of the stupidest?

946
01:01:41,240 --> 01:01:44,357
People do horrible things for money.
And a Green Card, too.

947
01:01:44,400 --> 01:01:45,469
No, no.

948
01:01:45,520 --> 01:01:47,715
But on the inside, Chandra is not like that.

949
01:01:47,760 --> 01:01:51,036
Not everyone can stand up to the pressure
the way you can, Lalita.

950
01:01:52,160 --> 01:01:54,151
Better single than unhappy. Tikk hai nah?

951
01:02:14,160 --> 01:02:15,798
I have to go.

952
01:02:18,760 --> 01:02:21,035
My mates are waiting for me in Varanasi.

953
01:02:23,200 --> 01:02:26,954
And I don't want to go
but I don't want to desert my mates either.

954
01:02:31,160 --> 01:02:33,196
Of course. Of course you should go.

955
01:02:34,240 --> 01:02:36,834
I knew you wouldn't stay for ever.

956
01:02:40,280 --> 01:02:43,238
<i>LAKHI: Johnny!
Wait, you can't leave without me.</i>

957
01:02:43,280 --> 01:02:44,679
- Oh.
- Oh.

958
01:02:44,720 --> 01:02:46,597
Oh. Oh, Lakhi.

959
01:02:46,640 --> 01:02:48,471
You'll come back, nah?

960
01:02:48,520 --> 01:02:49,839
Maybe, yeah.

961
01:02:49,880 --> 01:02:52,348
And, and don't you dare remove this, OK?

962
01:02:52,400 --> 01:02:55,949
You know it's bad luck if you do,
and you promised you wouldn't.

963
01:02:56,920 --> 01:02:58,831
All right, well, um...

964
01:02:58,880 --> 01:03:00,711
Well, I'd better go. OK?

965
01:03:00,760 --> 01:03:02,432
I don't want to miss that train.

966
01:03:02,480 --> 01:03:04,038
Come.

967
01:03:10,960 --> 01:03:12,871

996
01:06:07,120 --> 01:06:10,032
Hello? Bakshis' residence.

997
01:06:11,000 --> 01:06:12,115
Yes.

998
01:06:13,280 --> 01:06:14,838
Why, hello, Kholi saab.

999
01:06:15,840 --> 01:06:17,717
<i>Really?</i>

1000
01:06:17,760 --> 01:06:20,035
That's very kind of you.

1001
01:06:20,080 --> 01:06:22,913
<i>It's really too much.</i>

1002
01:06:22,960 --> 01:06:26,316
Chandra wants us to be at her wedding in LA.

1003
01:06:26,360 --> 01:06:28,476
<i>They are sending us four tickets.</i>

1004
01:06:28,520 --> 01:06:30,272
Come on.

1005
01:06:33,120 --> 01:06:34,269
Hi, Chandra.

1006
01:06:34,320 --> 01:06:36,629
Four tickets.

1007
01:06:36,680 --> 01:06:39,274
It's so good to hear you sounding so happy.

1008
01:06:39,320 --> 01:06:43,711
Jaya, we can stop over in London.
You can meet Balraj again.

1009
01:06:43,760 --> 01:06:46,354
(Big Ben chiming)

1010
01:07:02,760 --> 01:07:04,557
All right, love.

1011
01:07:11,760 --> 01:07:13,159
Hello?

1012
01:07:13,200 --> 01:07:14,997
Is that Kiran?

1013
01:07:15,040 --> 01:07:18,874
Hi. It's Jaya Bakshi... from Amritsar.

1014
01:07:20,400 --> 01:07:22,709
Actually, we were just passing through London.

1015
01:07:23,680 --> 01:07:25,079
Really?

1016
01:07:25,120 --> 01:07:26,109
OK.

1017
01:07:26,160 --> 01:07:27,991
We'll come by today, then.

1018
01:07:28,040 --> 01:07:29,189
Great.

1019
01:07:29,240 --> 01:07:30,753
Bye.

1020
01:07:30,800 --> 01:07:31,915
See!

1021
01:07:36,640 --> 01:07:39,871
How nice to see you all again
in our part of the world.

1022
01:07:40,560 --> 01:07:41,959
The Thames.

1023
01:07:42,000 --> 01:07:43,433
Windsor Castle.

1024

<i>Oh, flag's up, Queen's at home.</i>

1025
01:07:46,320 --> 01:07:47,673
The Queen?

1026
01:07:48,640 --> 01:07:50,073
So many lovely paintings.

1027
01:07:51,240 --> 01:07:54,869
- Is that an Andy Warhol?
- Wrong decade.

1028
01:07:54,920 --> 01:07:57,514
We have several originals
Mummy found in Barcelona.

1029
01:07:57,560 --> 01:07:59,437
Oh, Italian. How nice.

1030
01:08:01,800 --> 01:08:03,597
Do sit down.

1031
01:08:18,280 --> 01:08:20,077
Lakhi.

1032
01:08:20,120 --> 01:08:21,951
- Oh, my God. Johnny!
- Hey!

1033
01:08:22,000 --> 01:08:24,434
How are you? Oh, my God.

1034
01:08:24,480 --> 01:08:27,517
- What are you doing here?
- Oh, I came here to surprise you.

1035
01:08:27,560 --> 01:08:30,074
You have. It's a lovely surprise. Thank you.

1036
01:08:30,120 --> 01:08:32,031
We brought her over from India.

1037
01:08:32,960 --> 01:08:35,713
Don't know how we'd manage without her.

1038
01:08:35,760 --> 01:08:36,875
(Laughs)

1039
01:08:36,920 --> 01:08:39,229
Um, won't Balraj be joining us for tea?

1040
01:08:39,280 --> 01:08:41,748
Oh, no. Didn't I tell you? Balraj isn't here.

1041
01:08:41,800 --> 01:08:45,031
He's in New York with my parents.

1042
01:08:46,240 --> 01:08:49,232
No, you didn't tell me.

1043
01:08:50,200 --> 01:08:54,512
Yeah... they wanted him to meet
a couple of girls out there.

1044
01:08:57,720 --> 01:08:58,914
Cake?

1045
01:08:58,960 --> 01:09:00,678
Lemon one's low fat.

1046

<i>Flight 714 to Los Angeles

<i>- Hey.
LAKHI: Oh, wow.</i>

1051

Hi.

1052
01:09:23,440 --> 01:09:25,158
I was just checking in and I...

1053
01:09:25,200 --> 01:09:26,633
You're on your way to LA?

1054
01:09:26,680 --> 01:09:29,319
Yes, we are going for Kholi's wedding.

1055
01:09:29,360 --> 01:09:30,588
Oh, of course.

1056
01:09:30,640 --> 01:09:35,270
They are booked into our hotel in Beverly Hills.
It's beautiful in the garden for a wedding.

1057
01:09:35,320 --> 01:09:38,551
- Oh, should we be getting on too?
- Not yet, Mama.

1058
01:09:38,600 --> 01:09:40,830
They let first class on before everyone else.

1059
01:09:40,880 --> 01:09:42,916
<i>MRS BAKSHI: I hope we are in better seats.</i>

1060
01:09:42,960 --> 01:09:46,157
Oooh, it was so crowded and noisy
coming from Delhi.

1061
01:09:46,200 --> 01:09:47,235
<i>Yeah.</i>

1062
01:09:48,200 --> 01:09:50,191
I had a meeting in London. On my way home.

1063
01:09:53,960 --> 01:09:56,713
Well, it's nice to see you all.

1064
01:09:56,760 --> 01:09:58,432
Maybe I'll see you at the wedding.

1065
01:10:01,920 --> 01:10:03,831
Thank God we're in economy.

1066
01:10:08,040 --> 01:10:11,191
One thing I asked - not to be near the toilets.

1067
01:10:11,240 --> 01:10:14,437
How will we sleep with all the flush noise
and the doors banging?

1068
01:10:14,480 --> 01:10:15,469
Hello.

1069
01:10:17,080 --> 01:10:21,437
- Pretty cramped back here, huh?
- Yes. No leg-room for my blood circulation.

1070
01:10:21,480 --> 01:10:24,870
Mrs Bakshi, would you like to
exchange seats with me in first?

1071
01:10:24,920 --> 01:10:26,433
No, we're fine, thank you.

1072
01:10:26,480 --> 01:10:28,232
<i>Really, young man?</i>

1073
01:10:28,280 --> 01:10:29,679
Me in first class?

1074
01:10:29,720 --> 01:10:31,358
<i>- Are you sure?
- Yes, please.</i>

1075
01:10:31,400 --> 01:10:35,075
- It's the least I could do to repay your hospitality.
- Sure.

1076
01:10:35,120 --> 01:10:36,678
Show me.

1077
01:10:36,720 --> 01:10:38,278
Come, show me.

1078
01:10:39,240 --> 01:10:42,312
Well, who could have guessed
he'd be so thoughtful?

1079
01:10:50,880 --> 01:10:52,836
Another glass of champagne, madame?

1080
01:10:52,880 --> 01:10:54,996
Yes. Thank you.

1081
01:11:05,840 --> 01:11:08,035
Well, your mom's very happy.

1082
01:11:08,080 --> 01:11:11,550
Thank you, but you really didn't need to do that.

1083
01:11:11,600 --> 01:11:13,875
Oh, it's a very small price to pay,

1084
01:11:13,920 --> 01:11:17,754
if it means I get to sit next to you
for the next ten hours and 53 minutes.

1085
01:11:19,280 --> 01:11:23,990
Well, I do intend to sleep
for at least ten of those hours.

1086
01:11:26,840 --> 01:11:28,034
Yeah.

1087
01:11:29,280 --> 01:11:30,759
How's Wickham?

1088
01:11:31,880 --> 01:11:34,917
Don't know, haven't heard from him.

1089
01:11:34,960 --> 01:11:37,030
Well, that sounds just like him.

1090
01:11:38,040 --> 01:11:40,110
Why do you hate him so much?

1091
01:11:42,640 --> 01:11:45,473
Listen, Lalita, some things are best left unsaid.

1092
01:11:45,520 --> 01:11:47,158
Now, I wouldn't lie to you.

1093
01:11:48,120 --> 01:11:50,509
You just have to trust me -
he's a nasty piece of work.

1094
01:11:52,000 --> 01:11:54,230
I would hate it if he ever hurt you.

1095
01:11:56,040 --> 01:11:58,235
I wanted to tell you in India but...

1096
01:11:59,480 --> 01:12:01,232
Well, I'm glad that I can warn you now.

1097
01:12:03,160 --> 01:12:04,957
Warn me?

1098
01:12:06,640 --> 01:12:09,632
Let's just say it's a good thing
that he hasn't been in touch.

1099
01:12:12,960 --> 01:12:15,793
And I guess the way you two were dancing...

1100
01:12:18,040 --> 01:12:19,792
...I was a little jealous.

1101
01:12:33,000 --> 01:12:34,831
What's going on with Balraj?

1102
01:12:35,600 --> 01:12:37,909
He never wrote or called Jaya ever since India.

1103
01:12:39,680 --> 01:12:41,477
You know, he and Kiran...

1104
01:12:41,520 --> 01:12:44,318
they know a fair bit about pressure
from their parents, too.

1105
01:12:45,880 --> 01:12:47,154
I guess we all do.

1106
01:12:48,120 --> 01:12:51,874
From what Johnny said, er,
I hear your mother's no different.

1107
01:12:51,920 --> 01:12:53,319
(Chuckles)

1108
01:12:53,360 --> 01:12:54,793
Yeah.

1109
01:12:55,840 --> 01:12:57,910
Well, I don't know what Johnny told you,

1110
01:12:57,960 --> 01:13:02,431
but my mom's probably not
the best judge on marriage.

1111
01:13:04,080 --> 01:13:08,039
I think sometimes the only reason that
my parents stayed together as long as they did

1112
01:13:08,080 --> 01:13:11,038
was... cos they lived in separate countries.

1113
01:13:13,440 --> 01:13:16,557
You know, I wanna marry someone
I can't wait to see every day.

1114
01:13:19,640 --> 01:13:22,518
You know,
we're not gonna get any sleep in these chairs.

1115
01:13:24,200 --> 01:13:25,758
Get used to it.

1116
01:13:25,800 --> 01:13:30,794
And take your arm off my arm-rest
and keep your leg to your side.

1117
01:13:37,960 --> 01:13:39,871
(Clunk)

1118
01:13:39,920 --> 01:13:41,797
(Both laugh)

1119
01:13:45,600 --> 01:13:47,192
¤ Hey, must be the money!

1120
01:13:47,240 --> 01:13:49,151
¤ If you wanna go and get high wit me

1121
01:13:49,200 --> 01:13:51,475
¤ Smoke an L in the back of the Benz-y

1122
01:13:51,520 --> 01:13:54,114
¤ Oh, why must I feel this way?

1123
01:13:54,160 --> 01:13:56,276
¤ Hey, must be the money!

1124
01:13:56,320 --> 01:13:57,514
Welcome.

1125
01:13:57,560 --> 01:13:58,879
Oh, hello.

1126
01:13:58,920 --> 01:14:01,150
¤ Hey, must be the money!

1127
01:14:04,200 --> 01:14:06,111
¤ Must be the money!

1128
01:14:09,320 --> 01:14:11,038
It's all good.

1129
01:14:11,080 --> 01:14:13,036
<i>KHOLl: And this is the en-suite bathroom.</i>

1130
01:14:13,080 --> 01:14:15,719
This one has hot-tub bath with super-jets.

1131
01:14:17,320 --> 01:14:19,675
Oh, oh, you must see this closet.

1132
01:14:19,720 --> 01:14:21,631
Just look at the space.

1133
01:14:21,680 --> 01:14:25,309
Chandra has this entire side
for all her 51 wedding suits.

1134
01:14:25,360 --> 01:14:26,395
51.

1135
01:14:26,440 --> 01:14:28,510
And that's gonna be the gym.

1136
01:14:28,560 --> 01:14:30,596
And that's my crib.

1137
01:14:32,760 --> 01:14:34,239
Very nice, Kholi saab.

1138
01:14:34,280 --> 01:14:36,191
<i>CHANDRA: I know what you're thinking.</i>

1139
01:14:36,240 --> 01:14:38,151
<i>But he's a good man.</i>

1140
01:14:38,200 --> 01:14:40,395
I'm not romantic like you, Lalita.

1141
01:14:41,640 --> 01:14:44,791
I didn't want to take the chance
in case my prince never came.

1142
01:14:46,920 --> 01:14:50,913
I know he's not for you, but...
but he's kind and...

1143
01:14:50,960 --> 01:14:52,951
and adores me.

1144
01:14:53,920 --> 01:14:55,831
And I love it here.

1145
01:15:01,320 --> 01:15:04,756
Chandra, I'm truly happy for you.

1146
01:15:06,200 --> 01:15:09,476
I... I think I was a bit too quick to judge him.

1147
01:15:10,560 --> 01:15:12,312
I'm sorry.

1148
01:15:13,600 --> 01:15:14,828
It's fine.

1149
01:15:32,840 --> 01:15:36,230
- Beautiful, isn't it?
- Yes, Kholi saab, it's lovely.

1150
01:15:36,280 --> 01:15:38,635
The ceiling is so ornate.

1151
01:15:38,680 --> 01:15:40,750
To think my wedding's going to be here!

1152
01:15:41,720 --> 01:15:43,676
Just put those figures on my desk.

1153
01:15:43,720 --> 01:15:45,472
Oh, here we go.

1154
01:15:49,360 --> 01:15:50,475
Hi.

1155
01:15:50,520 --> 01:15:51,953
Hey.

1156
01:15:52,000 --> 01:15:53,911
- Mr Darcy.
- Hello, everyone.

1157
01:15:53,960 --> 01:15:57,191
Good afternoon, sir.
Isn't it great we're all together again?

1158
01:15:57,240 --> 01:16:01,119
Er, only this time we have
home-court advantage, no, sir?

1159
01:16:03,560 --> 01:16:05,551
OK, come on, I'll show you around.

1160
01:16:05,600 --> 01:16:07,033
- Please.
- Mama.

1161
01:16:07,080 --> 01:16:08,513
Come, come. Come, Beta.

1162
01:16:09,280 --> 01:16:11,999
Mmm, that's very good, Paul.

1163
01:16:12,040 --> 01:16:14,270
Excellent. I'll put the order in today.

1164
01:16:14,320 --> 01:16:15,673
Mmm.

1165
01:16:15,720 --> 01:16:17,597
Mmm, Will!

1166
01:16:19,560 --> 01:16:20,913
Mother.

1167
01:16:24,520 --> 01:16:26,351
I'd like you to meet the Bakshi family.

1168
01:16:27,320 --> 01:16:30,551
So these are Kholi's relatives?

1169
01:16:30,600 --> 01:16:32,318
Such a pleasure to meet you, madam.

1170
01:16:32,360 --> 01:16:34,078
And your lovely hotel.

1171
01:16:34,120 --> 01:16:36,429
It's, er, first class.

1172
01:16:36,480 --> 01:16:38,436
So tell me everything about India.

1173
01:16:38,480 --> 01:16:40,311
I've always been fascinated by it.

1174
01:16:41,280 --> 01:16:44,636
India is such a huge country,
I wouldn't know where to begin.

1175
01:16:46,560 --> 01:16:49,711
It's always been a dream of mine,
since I was a little girl, to go there.

1176
01:16:49,760 --> 01:16:52,911
I was devastated
when Will said that I shouldn't go.

1177
01:16:52,960 --> 01:16:55,349
Oh, that's not what I said, Mother.

1178
01:16:55,400 --> 01:16:58,392
I said that it might be hard for you to travel there.

1179
01:16:59,400 --> 01:17:02,392
But you're the one
that didn't want to buy the hotel there.

1180
01:17:02,440 --> 01:17:03,793
The Board wanted to.

1181
01:17:03,840 --> 01:17:07,116
Oh, everybody has their hand on India
these days.

1182
01:17:07,160 --> 01:17:09,196
But Will refused.

1183
01:17:09,240 --> 01:17:11,515
Well, that was for lots of reasons.

1184
01:17:11,560 --> 01:17:16,429
In fact, it was Lalita who helped me
make that decision.

1185
01:17:16,480 --> 01:17:18,391
A decision that lost us a fortune.

1186
01:17:19,960 --> 01:17:22,679
Well, there's so much to see in India, Mrs Darcy.

1187
01:17:22,720 --> 01:17:24,472
You must come some time.

1188
01:17:24,520 --> 01:17:26,590
Well, if I had a hotel, I might have.

1189
01:17:26,640 --> 01:17:29,757
But, well, with yoga, and spices,
and Deepak Chopra,

1190
01:17:29,800 --> 01:17:31,836
<i>and wonderful Eastern things here,</i>

1191
01:17:31,880 --> 01:17:34,155
there's no point in travelling there any more.

1192
01:17:34,200 --> 01:17:36,430
Well, I don't know about that.

1193
01:17:37,320 --> 01:17:41,916
People haven't stopped going to Italy
because Pizza Hut's around their corner.

1194
01:17:41,960 --> 01:17:43,712
Yes, right.

1195
01:17:43,760 --> 01:17:45,193
Yes.

1196
01:17:45,240 --> 01:17:46,514
Ah, Georgina.

1197
01:17:46,560 --> 01:17:48,835
Oh, hey, Georgie.

1198
01:17:48,880 --> 01:17:50,233
Hey.

1199
01:17:50,280 --> 01:17:51,918
Hey, come here.

1200
01:17:51,960 --> 01:17:55,589
Everyone, I'd like you to meet
my little sister, Georgie.

1201
01:17:55,640 --> 01:17:58,108
- Hi.
- Hi.

1202
01:17:58,160 --> 01:18:00,071
So this is Lalita?

1203
01:18:00,120 --> 01:18:01,269
Yeah.

1204
01:18:01,320 --> 01:18:05,757
Oh, Will told me all about your fab time
together in India.

1205
01:18:05,800 --> 01:18:08,473
Food poisoning, being ravaged by mosquitoes.

1206
01:18:08,520 --> 01:18:10,556
Not your brother's idea of a perfect holiday.

1207
01:18:10,600 --> 01:18:12,192
There were lots of things I liked.

1208
01:18:12,240 --> 01:18:14,435
Well, I hope I get to hear you play guitar.

1209
01:18:14,480 --> 01:18:17,199
- What?
- Yeah, Will said you played beautifully.

1210
01:18:18,160 --> 01:18:19,195
No.

1211
01:18:19,240 --> 01:18:20,992
<i>He'sjust exaggerating.</i>

1212
01:18:21,040 --> 01:18:22,996
No, my brother never lies.

1213
01:18:24,440 --> 01:18:26,078
Lunch.

1214
01:18:26,120 --> 01:18:29,237
He's one of the most eligible bachelors
in this town.

1215
01:18:29,280 --> 01:18:31,999
You should be stirring
your husband's dinner, not trouble.

1216
01:18:32,040 --> 01:18:34,838
- Darcy was just being friendly.
- Very friendly.

1217
01:18:37,160 --> 01:18:40,630
After meeting his mother,
I even felt a little sorry for him.

1218
01:18:40,680 --> 01:18:44,070
I think what changed your mind
was seeing the size of his hotel.

1219
01:18:44,120 --> 01:18:46,031
(Phone rings)

1220
01:18:46,080 --> 01:18:48,196
<i>KHOLl: Oh, hello?</i>

1221
01:18:48,240 --> 01:18:50,754
Ah, hello, Mr Darcy.

1222
01:18:51,840 --> 01:18:53,751
What can I do for you?

1223
01:18:53,800 --> 01:18:55,711
Oh, Lalita. Yeah.

1224
01:18:55,760 --> 01:18:57,671
Well, yes, she's just here.

1225
01:18:57,720 --> 01:18:58,914
Huh?

1226
01:19:00,240 --> 01:19:01,355
(Falsetto cry)

1227
01:19:01,400 --> 01:19:03,311
(Cheering and whooping)

1228
01:19:06,880 --> 01:19:08,791
(Singing in Spanish)

1229
01:19:24,720 --> 01:19:28,713
Here's to the only person
I've ever seen stand up to my mother.

1230
01:19:29,760 --> 01:19:31,273
I hope I wasn't too rude.

1231
01:19:31,320 --> 01:19:32,878
Mmm. Trust me, it's good for her.

1232
01:19:38,440 --> 01:19:40,795
It reminded me of when I first arrived in India.

1233
01:19:40,840 --> 01:19:45,311
I'm trying to deal with everything and then,
boom, you jump straight down my throat.

1234
01:19:45,360 --> 01:19:46,998
I didn't know what had hit me.

1235
01:19:47,040 --> 01:19:48,871
You deserved it.

1236
01:19:48,920 --> 01:19:50,558
Oh, come on.

1237
01:19:52,040 --> 01:19:53,951
(Song finishes)

1238
01:20:00,360 --> 01:20:01,759
I really like this place.

1239
01:20:01,800 --> 01:20:04,439
It's not at all where I expected you'd take me.

1240
01:20:04,480 --> 01:20:07,438
Ah-ha, you see. I told you you misjudged me.

1241
01:20:10,400 --> 01:20:11,799
The band is great.

1242
01:20:13,000 --> 01:20:14,911
Why don't you show them how it's done?

1243
01:20:14,960 --> 01:20:16,313
No, no, no, no, no way.

1244
01:20:16,360 --> 01:20:19,989
No, I guess your guitar playing can't compare
to your sister's snake dance.

1245
01:20:33,160 --> 01:20:35,071
(Romantic music)

1246
01:21:11,360 --> 01:21:13,271
¤ Show me the way

1247
01:21:13,320 --> 01:21:15,709
¤ Take me to love

1248
01:21:16,720 --> 01:21:20,952
¤ Things only heard now I want to feel

1249
01:21:21,680 --> 01:21:24,672
¤ My soul caressed by silken breeze

1250
01:21:24,720 --> 01:21:27,029
¤ Whisper secrets to listening trees

1251
01:21:27,080 --> 01:21:28,638
¤ Show me that world

1252
01:21:28,680 --> 01:21:30,318
¤ Take me to love

1253
01:21:32,240 --> 01:21:33,593
¤ Show me the way

1254
01:21:33,640 --> 01:21:35,870
¤ Take me to love

1255
01:21:41,920 --> 01:21:44,229
¤ Come out, blue moon

1256
01:21:46,920 --> 01:21:50,071
¤ I need a friend soon

1257
01:21:52,000 --> 01:21:56,152
¤ To share what I feel, it's so rare

1258
01:21:57,240 --> 01:22:02,030
¤ Shine down on me so I can see

1259
01:22:02,080 --> 01:22:07,234
¤ The silver street that leads me
to the place I want to be

1260
01:22:08,200 --> 01:22:09,553
¤ Show me the way

1261
01:22:09,600 --> 01:22:11,556
¤ Take me to love

1262
01:22:46,480 --> 01:22:47,993
¤ Show them the way

1263
01:22:48,040 --> 01:22:50,270
¤ Take them to love

1264
01:22:51,440 --> 01:22:55,558
¤ Things only heard now they want to be

1265
01:22:56,520 --> 01:22:59,034
¤ Two beings with one beating heart

1266
01:22:59,080 --> 01:23:01,594
¤ For their whole lives not to part

1267
01:23:01,640 --> 01:23:03,312
¤ Show them that world

1268
01:23:03,360 --> 01:23:04,998
¤ Take them to love

1269
01:23:06,840 --> 01:23:10,549
¤ La-la la-la la la-la-la

1270
01:23:10,600 --> 01:23:12,079
¤ Show them the way

1271
01:23:12,120 --> 01:23:13,678
¤ La-la la-la

01:23:15,800 --> 01:23:19,236
¤ Take them to love

01:23:19,280 --> 01:23:22,238

01:23:30,040 --> 01:23:32,270
¤ Yeah-yeah yeah-yeah...

1279
01:24:05,840 --> 01:24:07,193
- Hey, how you doing?
- Great.

1280
01:24:07,240 --> 01:24:08,719
- This is my wife.
- Nameste.

1281
01:24:08,760 --> 01:24:10,955
- My mother-in-law.
- Hello.

1282
01:24:11,000 --> 01:24:12,399
Jaya, smile, please.

1283
01:24:12,440 --> 01:24:14,908
Your face looks like
a baby's smacked bottom.

1284
01:24:14,960 --> 01:24:18,669
Kholi wants you to meet
a plastic surgeon from Orange County.

1285
01:24:18,720 --> 01:24:21,314
I can't just forget Balraj like that, Mama.

1286
01:24:21,360 --> 01:24:23,157
Please don't make it any worse.

1287
01:24:23,200 --> 01:24:24,758
I'm sorry, excuse me.

1288
01:24:24,800 --> 01:24:26,791
Er, can I talk to you for a second?

1289
01:24:28,920 --> 01:24:30,831
You look more comfortable this time.

1290
01:24:30,880 --> 01:24:33,519
<i>- It really suits you.
- There you are!</i>

1291
01:24:33,560 --> 01:24:36,711
- Hi, Lalita.
- Hello, Mrs Darcy.

1292
01:24:36,760 --> 01:24:39,911
Er, I'd like you to meet Will's girlfriend, Anne.

1293
01:24:39,960 --> 01:24:41,712
Lolita.

1294
01:24:41,760 --> 01:24:45,355
That's such a cute name.
Like the movie, right?

1295
01:24:45,400 --> 01:24:48,278
Er, it's, um, Lalita.

1296
01:24:48,320 --> 01:24:50,072
Nice to meet you...

1297
01:24:50,120 --> 01:24:51,394
Anne.

1298
01:24:51,440 --> 01:24:53,874
- Anne.
- This is so much fun.

1299
01:24:53,920 --> 01:24:55,399
Look at all the colours.

1300
01:24:55,440 --> 01:24:57,954
Just imagine, she would have missed all of this,

1301
01:24:58,000 --> 01:25:01,788
so I insisted that she come
on the plane from New York with me.

1302
01:25:01,840 --> 01:25:05,389
<i>Lalita, doesn't Anne look wonderful
in Indian clothes?</i>

1303
01:25:05,440 --> 01:25:06,953
Oh, stop that, Catherine.

1304
01:25:07,000 --> 01:25:08,194
She's too kind.

1305
01:25:08,240 --> 01:25:09,958
You look lovely.

1306
01:25:10,000 --> 01:25:12,036
<i>Shall we go? The ceremony is starting.</i>

1307
01:25:19,240 --> 01:25:23,279
<i>...keep her, in sickness and in health,
as long as you both shall live?</i>

1308
01:25:23,320 --> 01:25:24,673
Yes, I do.

1309
01:25:25,480 --> 01:25:29,314
Chandra, do you take this man as your
lawfully wedded husband, to love,

1310
01:25:29,360 --> 01:25:31,555
<i>honour and comfort him, and to keep him,</i>

1311
01:25:31,600 --> 01:25:34,194
<i>in sickness and in health,
as long as you both shall live?</i>

1312
01:25:34,240 --> 01:25:35,514
Yes, I do.

1313
01:25:35,560 --> 01:25:38,154
By the power vested in me
by the state of California,

1314
01:25:38,200 --> 01:25:41,909
<i>I hereby pronounce you man and wife.
You may kiss.</i>

1315
01:25:58,160 --> 01:25:59,513
- Hi.
- Hey.

1316
01:25:59,560 --> 01:26:00,834
- You OK?
- Yeah.

1317
01:26:00,880 --> 01:26:02,791
- Thanks.
- Sure.

1318
01:26:05,080 --> 01:26:07,913
- That ceremony was so beautiful.
- Yeah.

1319
01:26:07,960 --> 01:26:10,554
- They both look really happy.
- Mm-hm.

1320
01:26:11,840 --> 01:26:16,038
So I guess the next Indian wedding
I'll get to go to is Balraj's.

1321
01:26:16,080 --> 01:26:19,356
Well, that's if he and my brother make up.

1322
01:26:19,400 --> 01:26:21,311
What do you mean?

1323
01:26:21,360 --> 01:26:25,478
Well, he and my brother
aren't really talking much right now.

1324
01:26:25,520 --> 01:26:26,839
Yeah? Why?

1325
01:26:27,920 --> 01:26:32,914
Um, he didn't tell me everything,
but I guess Balraj met someone in India

1326
01:26:32,960 --> 01:26:35,076
and Will didn't think she was right

1327
01:26:35,120 --> 01:26:37,634
and ended up having to talk him
out of marrying her.

1328
01:26:38,320 --> 01:26:40,231
Your brother talked him out of it?

1329
01:26:40,280 --> 01:26:42,475
<i>Oh, no, he wasjust looking out for him.</i>

1330
01:26:42,520 --> 01:26:45,398
The girl's mom was a total nightmare.

1331
01:26:45,440 --> 01:26:49,433
<i>She was a gold-digger
out to nail a rich hubby for her daughter.</i>

1332
01:26:49,480 --> 01:26:51,198
Scary or what?

1333
01:26:52,160 --> 01:26:54,037
<i>Oh, there's Will.</i>

1334
01:26:58,080 --> 01:27:00,548
Oh, I'm... I'm sorry, I gotta go.

1335
01:27:02,720 --> 01:27:04,517
Lalita, wait.

1336
01:27:07,080 --> 01:27:09,355
Please, give me a minute to explain.

1337
01:27:11,320 --> 01:27:13,470
I'm sorry about Anne coming. I didn't know.

1338
01:27:13,520 --> 01:27:16,751
I don't give a damn about her.
I hope you two are very happy.

1339
01:27:17,720 --> 01:27:21,315
I don't love her.
My mother never told me she was inviting her.

1340
01:27:21,360 --> 01:27:24,636
Look, it's not my business
what you and your mother do.

1341
01:27:24,680 --> 01:27:26,079
Yes, it is.

1342
01:27:27,160 --> 01:27:28,593
Look, Lalita...

1343
01:27:29,560 --> 01:27:30,993
...I love you.

1344
01:27:38,040 --> 01:27:40,679
And I hated seeing you with Wickham in India.

1345
01:27:40,720 --> 01:27:44,076
And I tried my hardest to forget you,
but I couldn't.

1346
01:27:44,120 --> 01:27:46,793
I know this sounds totally crazy,
my mom's gonna flip out,

1347
01:27:46,840 --> 01:27:48,512
but I don't want you to leave.

1348
01:27:51,280 --> 01:27:55,637
Only you could say that you love me
and insult me at the same time.

1349
01:27:57,560 --> 01:27:58,788
What?

1350
01:27:58,840 --> 01:28:00,239
You tried to forget me.

1351
01:28:00,280 --> 01:28:03,590
Loving me is crazy.
I'm not good enough for your mother.

1352
01:28:03,640 --> 01:28:08,998
And you think I'd want to leave my family for you
after you've ruined my sister's life?

1353
01:28:09,040 --> 01:28:10,951
- Hold on, hold on.
- Georgie told me.

1354
01:28:11,000 --> 01:28:13,468
You talked Balraj out of marrying Jaya.

1355
01:28:18,600 --> 01:28:21,433
Yeah, yeah, I did. But I had my reasons.

1356
01:28:22,360 --> 01:28:26,148
- And you ruined Wickham's life too.
- Look, just let me explain.

1357
01:28:26,200 --> 01:28:30,034
We may not have your family's money,
but that does not make us inferior to you.

1358
01:28:30,080 --> 01:28:32,036
I'm being honest with you here, all right?

1359
01:28:32,080 --> 01:28:34,469
My family are not gonna be
jumping for joy about it.

1360
01:28:34,520 --> 01:28:35,999
I'm telling you that I don't care.

1361
01:28:37,400 --> 01:28:43,430
When I first met you, I thought you were rude,
arrogant, intolerant and insensitive.

1362
01:28:44,400 --> 01:28:48,712
But over the last few days,
I thought maybe... maybe I'd made a mistake.

1363
01:28:50,040 --> 01:28:51,758
But I was right.

1364
01:28:51,800 --> 01:28:55,634
You're the last person I'd ever want to be with.

1365
01:29:26,840 --> 01:29:28,512
Hey, Mr Darcy. How are you doing?

1366
01:29:28,560 --> 01:29:30,755
Hey, Kholi. Er, is Lalita here?

1367
01:29:30,800 --> 01:29:32,756
I'm sorry, sir, you've missed her.

1368
01:29:32,800 --> 01:29:34,711
- What?
- I took them to the airport.

1369
01:29:34,760 --> 01:29:36,512
They're on their way to London.

1370
01:29:37,480 --> 01:29:39,710
You want to come in for a beer or something?

1371
01:30:04,080 --> 01:30:05,354
I'll get it.

1372
01:30:06,600 --> 01:30:08,556
<i>MRS BAKSHI: It's so tragic.</i>

1373
01:30:08,600 --> 01:30:10,795
Not a single proposal.

1374
01:30:10,840 --> 01:30:12,751
So sad.

1375
01:30:12,800 --> 01:30:16,349
My fate is to live in that rotten house

1376
01:30:16,400 --> 01:30:19,915
full of spinsters and no grandchildren.

1377
01:30:19,960 --> 01:30:23,157
- Don't worry.
- Everything will be all right.

1378
01:30:23,200 --> 01:30:27,876
Mama... I was thinking, can I go shopping?

1379
01:30:27,920 --> 01:30:30,753
- Go, Lakhi, go.
- Thank you, Mama.

1380
01:30:32,000 --> 01:30:35,595
If we are not bringing back any husbands,
and she goes shopping,

1381
01:30:35,640 --> 01:30:38,074
at least we won't be going back empty-handed.

1382
01:30:39,040 --> 01:30:40,519
(Sniffs)

1383
01:30:46,720 --> 01:30:49,314
Hey, what's wrong?

1384
01:30:50,640 --> 01:30:52,710
We almost did have a proposal.

1385
01:30:52,760 --> 01:30:54,796
A proposal?

1386
01:30:54,840 --> 01:30:56,512
Who?

1387
01:30:58,360 --> 01:31:00,351
- Will Darcy.
- Darcy?

1388
01:31:01,960 --> 01:31:03,996
I know this sounds crazy.

1389
01:31:04,040 --> 01:31:05,951
What did he say?

1390
01:31:07,080 --> 01:31:08,957
That he loves me.

1391
01:31:09,000 --> 01:31:10,911
And what did you say?

1392
01:31:17,120 --> 01:31:19,031
(Lively music and excited screams)

1393
01:31:33,280 --> 01:31:35,191
- Hello.
- Hi.

1394
01:31:35,240 --> 01:31:37,276
- How are you?
- Good to see you.

1395
01:31:37,320 --> 01:31:38,639
Good to see you.

1396
01:31:38,680 --> 01:31:40,989
- How long have you been waiting?
- Not very long.

1397
01:31:41,040 --> 01:31:42,553
Shall we go? Come on.

1398
01:31:47,120 --> 01:31:49,270
It's from Lakhi.

1399
01:31:52,400 --> 01:31:53,833
God.

1400
01:32:06,240 --> 01:32:08,196
(Doorbell rings)

1401
01:32:33,280 --> 01:32:35,111
- Darcy...
- Lalita...

1402
01:32:40,000 --> 01:32:41,911
I feel like I owe you an apology.

1403
01:32:41,960 --> 01:32:44,872
- This isn't a good time.
- Lalita, please, just...

1404
01:32:51,840 --> 01:32:53,637
I'm sorry about Jaya.

1405
01:32:53,680 --> 01:32:56,797
<i>I wasn't sure whether she really loved Balraj.</i>

1406
01:32:56,840 --> 01:32:59,752
I thought your mom was just pushing her.

1407
01:33:04,800 --> 01:33:06,199
I was an idiot.

1408
01:33:08,400 --> 01:33:11,073
I've apologised to Balraj
because I know he still loves her.

1409
01:33:11,120 --> 01:33:13,509
- He'd like to see her.
- I don't have time for this.

1410
01:33:13,560 --> 01:33:16,074
- Wickham has...
- Wickham is a liar.

1411
01:33:17,280 --> 01:33:19,748
<i>He got my sister pregnant when she was 16.</i>

1412
01:33:20,840 --> 01:33:23,479
And he ran off and tried to marry her
for my father's money.

1413
01:33:23,520 --> 01:33:25,715
I stopped him and I had to pick up the pieces.

Lakhi has gone off with Wickham.

What?

1418
01:33:34,360 --> 01:33:36,954
Lakhi went out shopping yesterday
and she never came back.

1419

It's so beautiful. I love it.

1425
01:33:55,880 --> 01:33:59,634
He left with some bird.
Said something about the London Eye.

1426
01:33:59,680 --> 01:34:01,079
Smile.

1427

<i>Go away!</i>

1437
01:35:07,400 --> 01:35:09,470

01:35:28,120 --> 01:35:30,190
Just... stop it now.

1444
01:35:36,000 --> 01:35:38,116
Leave him. Let's go.

1445

<i>Not him. Please, anyone...</i>

1447
01:35:43,840 --> 01:35:45,751
Don't you dare.

Lalita, it was always you!

1449

<i>What sorry?</i>

1455
01:36:07,080 --> 01:36:10,152
No boy's coming within ten miles of you
until you get married.

1456
01:36:11,320 --> 01:36:14,392
Mama, Papa, it's Will who found her.

1457

from side to side

1585
