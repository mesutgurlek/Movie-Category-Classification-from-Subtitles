1
00:02:11,564 --> 00:02:13,498
There you are.

2
00:02:15,902 --> 00:02:18,894
Say, has, uh, this castle
always had four turrets?

3
00:02:18,972 --> 00:02:20,098
Always.

4
00:02:21,508 --> 00:02:23,533
Four turrets.

5
00:02:23,610 --> 00:02:25,544
That doesn't seem right.

6
00:02:27,447 --> 00:02:30,746
If you hurry, sir,
you'll still be in time
to catch the last tour.

7
00:02:30,817 --> 00:02:32,751
Thanks.

8
00:02:35,488 --> 00:02:37,581
The room you are now
standing in...

9
00:02:37,657 --> 00:02:40,353
is an ancient banquet hall.

10
00:02:40,426 --> 00:02:42,690
And this table,
ladies and gentlemen,

11
00:02:42,762 --> 00:02:45,492
is said to be the famed
Round Table...

12
00:02:45,565 --> 00:02:47,499
used by King Arthur.

13
00:02:47,567 --> 00:02:51,401
Many of the restored shields of
the Knights of the Round Table
can be seen on these standards.

14
00:02:51,471 --> 00:02:53,405
Sir Bedivere.

15
00:02:53,473 --> 00:02:55,464
Sir...
[Man]
Sir Bors de Ganis.

16
00:02:55,542 --> 00:02:57,510
Sir...
Sir Lancelot of the Lake.

17
00:02:58,778 --> 00:03:00,643
If you don't mind!

18
00:03:00,713 --> 00:03:03,648
Not at all.
Go right ahead.

19
00:03:03,716 --> 00:03:07,083
Now, ladies and gentlemen,
if you'll kindly follow me.

20
00:03:09,422 --> 00:03:11,356
Over here,
ladies and gentlemen,

21
00:03:11,424 --> 00:03:14,552
we have the shields
of Sir Galahad,

22
00:03:14,627 --> 00:03:16,788
Sir Dalliance,

23
00:03:16,863 --> 00:03:19,832
and Sir Sagramore
le Desirous.

24
00:03:19,899 --> 00:03:22,561
Good old Saggy.

25
00:03:22,635 --> 00:03:25,468
And over here,
ladies and gentlemen,

26
00:03:25,538 --> 00:03:27,972
a remarkably preserved
portrait.

27
00:03:28,041 --> 00:03:30,066
Lady Alisande la Carteloise.

28
00:03:30,143 --> 00:03:34,375
[Woman]
Wasn't she lovely?
Lovely indeed, madam.

29
00:03:34,447 --> 00:03:39,783
She was renowned in legend
as King Arthur's
favorite niece.

30
00:03:39,852 --> 00:03:42,753
Over here,
ladies and gentlemen...
Pardon me...

31
00:03:42,822 --> 00:03:46,485
we have a hauberk dating
from the sixth century...

32
00:03:46,559 --> 00:03:49,926
said to have been worn
by Sir Logris of Astolat.

33
00:03:49,996 --> 00:03:52,658
Kindly notice the round hole
through the breastplate,

34
00:03:52,732 --> 00:03:56,532
undoubtedly caused
by an iron-tipped arrow
of the period.

35
00:03:56,603 --> 00:03:58,696
Mm-mmm.

36
00:03:58,771 --> 00:04:01,569
I mean... Well, you see,
that happens to be
a bullet hole.

37
00:04:01,641 --> 00:04:04,508
Impossible!
Firearms weren't invented...

38
00:04:04,577 --> 00:04:06,636
until the 15th century.
[Chuckles]

39
00:04:06,713 --> 00:04:10,080
Oh, come now.
Perhaps the gentleman
saw the bullet fired.

40
00:04:10,149 --> 00:04:12,208
Perhaps the gentleman
was there.

41
00:04:12,285 --> 00:04:14,583
Matter of fact, I was.

42
00:04:15,655 --> 00:04:19,921
Undoubtedly caused
by an iron-tipped arrow
of the period.

43
00:04:22,362 --> 00:04:25,593
Well, uh,
that concludes the tour,
ladies and gentlemen.

44
00:04:25,665 --> 00:04:29,601
On behalf of the orphanage
and Lord Pendragon,
I hope you've enjoyed it.

45
00:04:29,669 --> 00:04:32,695
This way out, please.
Thank you.
It's been most interesting.

46
00:05:03,970 --> 00:05:07,497
I beg your pardon, sir. Lord
Pendragon would like to see you.
Hmm?

47
00:05:07,573 --> 00:05:09,564
Well, that's
very nice of him.

48
00:05:11,177 --> 00:05:13,873
Just as I remember her.

49
00:05:13,946 --> 00:05:17,040
[Clears Throat]
This way, sir.
Yes.

50
00:05:21,120 --> 00:05:23,281
"Just as I remember her"?

51
00:05:26,392 --> 00:05:30,795
And she dead
these 1300 years.

52
00:05:30,863 --> 00:05:32,797
[Knocking]

53
00:05:32,865 --> 00:05:36,665
Come in, come in.
[Sneezes]

54
00:05:36,736 --> 00:05:38,670
And shut the door.

55
00:05:40,973 --> 00:05:43,771
That's the worst
of these confounded castles...
very picturesque and all that,

56
00:05:43,843 --> 00:05:45,834
but the wind whistles through
like a howling gale.

57
00:05:45,912 --> 00:05:48,779
This is
the American gentleman,
Your Lordship.

58
00:05:48,848 --> 00:05:51,681
I'm quite aware
it's the American gentleman.

59
00:05:51,751 --> 00:05:53,912
You may go, Richards.
But, Your Lordship...

60
00:05:53,986 --> 00:05:56,250
Go, go. Scat.

61
00:05:58,658 --> 00:06:01,058
Now, no tricks, young man.

62
00:06:01,127 --> 00:06:04,619
I warn you,
I boxed for Cambridge
until my arm...

63
00:06:04,697 --> 00:06:06,631
[Sneezes]

64
00:06:08,234 --> 00:06:12,728
Now, what's all this
I hear about your
creating a disturbance?

65
00:06:12,805 --> 00:06:14,739
You don't look balmy.

66
00:06:14,807 --> 00:06:16,934
I assure you,
Your Lordship,
I'm perfectly sane.

67
00:06:17,009 --> 00:06:20,001
Well, stop staring at me
as if I were a ghost.

68
00:06:20,580 --> 00:06:22,946
Have we met before?
Here.

69
00:06:23,015 --> 00:06:25,483
Well, no, not exactly.
What do you mean,
not exactly?

70
00:06:25,551 --> 00:06:28,714
Either we've met before
or we haven't.
It's difficult to explain.

71
00:06:28,788 --> 00:06:31,814
L-I feel like I know you.
I know this castle...

72
00:06:31,891 --> 00:06:34,826
and the girl in
the painting downstairs...
Lady Alisande.

73
00:06:34,894 --> 00:06:37,124
I know her too.
Wait, wait. Don't ring.

74
00:06:37,196 --> 00:06:38,925
I wanna show you something.

75
00:06:39,999 --> 00:06:42,559
Take a look at this.
What is it?

76
00:06:42,635 --> 00:06:44,569
It's a gold amulet,

77
00:06:44,637 --> 00:06:47,765
just like the one
on the girl in the painting.

78
00:06:47,840 --> 00:06:50,638
Yes, yes, of course.
Of course.

79
00:06:50,710 --> 00:06:53,474
A remarkable duplicate.
It's not
a duplicate, sir.

80
00:06:53,546 --> 00:06:56,538
Where did you get it?
She gave it to me.

81
00:06:56,616 --> 00:06:59,312
Young man,
you're either a liar
or a lunatic,

82
00:06:59,385 --> 00:07:02,115
and I'm not gonna sit here...

83
00:07:02,188 --> 00:07:03,348
Here.

84
00:07:04,257 --> 00:07:06,191
Thank you.
Excuse me.

85
00:07:08,661 --> 00:07:12,893
I've been wanting to
get this off my chest
for a long time.

86
00:07:12,965 --> 00:07:14,830
I'm not keeping you
from anything, am I?
[Mutters]

87
00:07:15,468 --> 00:07:18,198
My name is Martin.
Hank Martin.

88
00:07:18,271 --> 00:07:21,069
I was born in Hartford,
Connecticut, U.S.A.

89
00:07:21,140 --> 00:07:24,075
I'm a blacksmith,
and my father
was a blacksmith before me.

90
00:07:24,143 --> 00:07:28,045
Or I was a blacksmith
until a few years ago, when
these automobiles came along.

91
00:07:28,114 --> 00:07:31,811
Boy, it sure is
powerful-looking.
Boy, it sure is.

92
00:07:31,884 --> 00:07:34,512
Go ahead and touch it.
I dare you.
[Engine Sputtering]

93
00:07:34,587 --> 00:07:37,317
You do it.
I asked you first.

94
00:07:37,390 --> 00:07:39,381
Yeah, he asked you first.

95
00:07:46,199 --> 00:07:48,133
[Backfires]
[Screams]
Look out!

96
00:07:54,974 --> 00:07:58,535
Did you fix it, Hank?
I fixed it, all right.

97
00:07:58,611 --> 00:08:01,102
The operation was a success,
but the patient died.

98
00:08:01,180 --> 00:08:03,546
Well, we'll give her
another whirl, huh?

99
00:08:03,616 --> 00:08:06,676
You kids in no hurry?
No, not me.

100
00:08:06,752 --> 00:08:08,686
What do you suppose
makes it go?

101
00:08:08,754 --> 00:08:11,655
- I know. There's a dragon in it.
- A what?

102
00:08:11,724 --> 00:08:16,024
A dragon,
just like in King Arthur,
that spits and shoots out fire.

103
00:08:16,095 --> 00:08:19,087
- Oh, you're daffy.
- I am not, am I, Hank?

104
00:08:19,165 --> 00:08:23,431
I think she's got
something there. What we need
is a little dragon bait.

105
00:08:26,239 --> 00:08:28,799
[Engine Sputtering]
Say, it's taken a hold.

106
00:08:28,875 --> 00:08:32,038
Oh, there's a dragon
in there, all right.

107
00:08:32,111 --> 00:08:34,875
[Backfires,
Engine Stops]

108
00:08:34,947 --> 00:08:37,848
I think it's a reluctant dragon.
We'll let it cool off a while.

109
00:08:42,555 --> 00:08:45,285
Does that book tell you
how to fix automobiles, Hank?

110
00:08:45,358 --> 00:08:47,485
This book tells you
how to fix everything.

111
00:08:47,560 --> 00:08:49,721
At least that's what the
fellow said that sold it to me.

112
00:08:49,795 --> 00:08:52,229
Wow! Look at that.
What is that thing, Hank?

113
00:08:52,298 --> 00:08:54,766
Yeah, what is it, Hank?
That's a phonograph.

114
00:08:54,834 --> 00:08:58,133
That'll bring
a 20-piece band
smack into your parlor.

115
00:08:58,204 --> 00:09:01,662
Drums and everything?
Sure.
Drums and everything.

116
00:09:01,741 --> 00:09:06,007
There's an electric light bulb,
a magic lantern and a motorcycle.

117
00:09:06,078 --> 00:09:08,012
Wow! Look at that!

118
00:09:08,080 --> 00:09:11,743
You mean we're gonna have
all those things someday, Hank?

119
00:09:11,817 --> 00:09:15,719
Son, every one of those things
in that book, every item,
we got 'em right now.

120
00:09:15,788 --> 00:09:18,256
You know why we got 'em? Because folks
who other folks thought were crazy...

121
00:09:18,324 --> 00:09:20,258
went out and invented 'em.

122
00:09:20,326 --> 00:09:23,159
That's how things get done...
by folks who shoot high,

123
00:09:23,229 --> 00:09:25,823
who just won't admit
they're licked.

124
00:09:33,072 --> 00:09:37,509
Oh, there's nothin'
to be ashamed of

125
00:09:37,577 --> 00:09:40,978
If you stub your toe
on the moon

126
00:09:41,047 --> 00:09:44,244
When a dream's
at the top of the sky

127
00:09:44,317 --> 00:09:47,252
Well, you just have
to jump pretty high

128
00:09:47,320 --> 00:09:51,552
But don't give up too soon

129
00:09:51,624 --> 00:09:55,151
If you stub your toe
on the moon

130
00:09:55,227 --> 00:09:59,129
Now, you take Harry Hadgetts.
[All]
Who's Harry Hadgetts?

131
00:09:59,198 --> 00:10:02,827
Young Harry Hadgetts
loved making gadgets

132
00:10:02,902 --> 00:10:06,065
"Life needs some new things"
was his claim

133
00:10:06,138 --> 00:10:09,869
Hoped one or two things
might bring fame

134
00:10:09,942 --> 00:10:12,809
This is the last time
you'll hear his name

135
00:10:12,878 --> 00:10:17,042
Nobody mentions
Harry's inventions

136
00:10:17,116 --> 00:10:20,347
But do you think
that got him down

137
00:10:20,419 --> 00:10:24,719
Here comes the end
When you've gadgets to mend

138
00:10:24,790 --> 00:10:28,453
He's the best repairman
in town

139
00:10:28,527 --> 00:10:32,486
So there's nothin'
to be ashamed of

140
00:10:32,565 --> 00:10:35,728
If you stub
your toe on the moon
Fred.

141
00:10:35,801 --> 00:10:39,293
When a dream's at
the top of the sky

142
00:10:39,372 --> 00:10:43,103
Well, you just have to jump
pretty high, high

143
00:10:43,175 --> 00:10:46,838
But don't give up too soon

144
00:10:46,912 --> 00:10:50,439
If you stub your toe
on the moon

145
00:10:50,516 --> 00:10:53,485
Now, you take
Sally Springer.
Who's Sally Springer?

146
00:10:53,552 --> 00:10:56,350
Well, it's a long story,
but I'll cut it down for you.

147
00:10:56,422 --> 00:11:00,358
Sweet Sally Springer
she was a singer

148
00:11:00,426 --> 00:11:03,259
Lived in a hall room
up one flight

149
00:11:03,329 --> 00:11:07,425
Thought of a ballroom
big and bright

150
00:11:07,500 --> 00:11:11,027
Where she would make
her debut some night

151
00:11:11,103 --> 00:11:14,732
Then for her trouble
"Pop" went the bubble

152

I have prepared
a song for the lute.

It's a simple thing...
Away, child.

that curdles the appetite
of an already-addled stomach,

it's a lute solo.

Sorry, my liege.

Noble King,
I crave pardon for this
most unseemly intrusion,

but I have just returned
from capturing the fiercest...

00:21:07,432 --> 00:21:09,730
of all human dragons.

280
00:21:09,801 --> 00:21:13,635
Behold, the monster!
[Murmuring]

281
00:21:13,705 --> 00:21:15,639
I'm a monster.

282
00:21:17,542 --> 00:21:19,476
A weird-looking creature.
How camest thou by him?

283
00:21:19,544 --> 00:21:22,206
'Tis a most wondrous tale,
my liege.

284

I fear we're in for it.

285
00:21:24,283 --> 00:21:28,344
My king,
ladies of the Royal Court,

286
00:21:28,420 --> 00:21:31,150
fellow Knights
of the Round Table,

287
00:21:31,223 --> 00:21:33,589
while riding
in a far land...

288
00:21:33,659 --> 00:21:36,822
I came upon a concourse
of a thousand ogres.

289
00:21:36,895 --> 00:21:39,090
And despite their numbers,

290
00:21:39,164 --> 00:21:43,396
determined to capture the most
sky-towering giant among them...

291
00:21:43,468 --> 00:21:47,734
Oh, here, now.
Wait a minute. I was alone.
I was asleep under a tree.

292
00:21:47,806 --> 00:21:49,740
Cease, monster!

293
00:21:51,610 --> 00:21:55,944
From dawn till dark
and dark till dawn, we battled.

294
00:21:56,014 --> 00:22:00,451
With lance and sword,
I laid upon the demon throng...

295
00:22:00,519 --> 00:22:02,510
till all were dead but one...

296
00:22:02,587 --> 00:22:05,385
the fiercest ogre of them all,

297
00:22:05,457 --> 00:22:07,982
when finally
I drove him to corner.

298
00:22:08,060 --> 00:22:10,551
He changed into a dragon,

299
00:22:10,629 --> 00:22:13,427
bellowing fire
and flame upon me!

300
00:22:13,498 --> 00:22:18,800
When that availed him naught,
he became a tusked
and taloned werewolf.

301
00:22:18,870 --> 00:22:20,804
Oh, now, see here,
Your Majesty...

302
00:22:20,872 --> 00:22:25,206
At last, the beast changed
to his present form,

303
00:22:25,277 --> 00:22:27,837
and with one mighty bound...

304
00:22:27,913 --> 00:22:30,882
leaped to the topmost
branch of a tree...

305
00:22:30,949 --> 00:22:33,179
200 cubits high!

306
00:22:33,251 --> 00:22:35,276
I picked up a stone...

307
00:22:35,354 --> 00:22:39,620
the size of a bullock
and hurled it at the beast.

308
00:22:39,691 --> 00:22:41,625
He fell to my feet.

309
00:22:43,562 --> 00:22:47,521
And here, milord,
here is living proof...

00:22:47,599 --> 00:22:49,533
of my mighty deed.

311
00:22:49,601 --> 00:22:52,866
[Sparse Applause]
I thank thee.

312
00:22:52,938 --> 00:22:57,568
Your Majesty,
mayeth I sayeth a few words?

313
00:22:57,642 --> 00:23:00,543
- In the first place...
- Silence, ogre!

314
00:23:00,612 --> 00:23:02,978
What makest thou
of the creature, Merlin?

315
00:23:03,048 --> 00:23:07,382
A most dangerous and evil demon.
The beast must be destroyed.

316
00:23:07,452 --> 00:23:09,886
A hanging?
No.

317
00:23:09,955 --> 00:23:12,719
Burning at the stake,
my liege.

318
00:23:14,593 --> 00:23:16,720
Pardon, milord,

319
00:23:16,795 --> 00:23:19,355
but the monster
seemeth a gentle soul.

320
00:23:19,431 --> 00:23:22,958
Gentle?
He hath nice eyes,

321
00:23:23,034 --> 00:23:26,526
and his features
are not unpleasant.

322
00:23:26,605 --> 00:23:30,097
True, true.
Monster, has thou a name?

323
00:23:30,175 --> 00:23:33,269
Hast. Martin.
Hank Martin.

324
00:23:33,345 --> 00:23:36,576
The truth now.
How camest thou to this kingdom?

325
00:23:36,648 --> 00:23:40,584
Well, I'm a little confused
as to how I came here,

326
00:23:40,652 --> 00:23:42,586
but I did come from Connecticut.

327
00:23:45,590 --> 00:23:48,354
Hast heard of, uh,

328
00:23:48,427 --> 00:23:50,361
what he just said?

329
00:23:50,429 --> 00:23:52,124
Couldst be in Ireland.

330
00:23:52,197 --> 00:23:54,722
Oh, no.
It's way past Ireland.

331
00:23:54,800 --> 00:23:58,327
You lie. There's naught
beyond Ireland
but the Great Sea.

332
00:23:59,471 --> 00:24:02,736
Trapped by his own words,
my liege.

333
00:24:02,808 --> 00:24:07,268
An evil demon
confronts us, whose abode is
the dismal depths of the ocean.

334
00:24:07,345 --> 00:24:10,803
Destroy this pestilence
e'er he destroy us!

335
00:24:10,882 --> 00:24:12,850
Thou hast a good point,
Merlin.
[Man] Death to the monster.!

336
00:24:12,918 --> 00:24:15,148
[All Shouting]

337
00:24:15,220 --> 00:24:17,211
Quiet, quiet!

338
00:24:17,289 --> 00:24:19,223
Oh, my ears.

339
00:24:20,859 --> 00:24:22,952
Monster,

340
00:24:23,028 --> 00:24:25,826
I have bad tidings for thee.

341
00:24:25,897 --> 00:24:28,889
Tomorrow morning,
thou burnest at the stake.

342
00:24:28,967 --> 00:24:30,901
Take him away.

343
00:24:30,969 --> 00:24:34,405
Well, Your Majesty,
if I can just have a minute to...

344
00:24:34,473 --> 00:24:37,442
I'd like to explain this...
Wait a minute! Hey! Help!

345
00:24:37,509 --> 00:24:39,443
Wait.! Help.!

346
00:24:46,818 --> 00:24:48,911
[Chattering]

347
00:25:09,908 --> 00:25:12,809
'Tis said this monster
has seven heads.

348
00:25:12,878 --> 00:25:14,937
Aye, and
a forked tail.

349
00:25:17,182 --> 00:25:20,811
It is I, Sir Sagramore.
Open for Sir Sagramore.

350
00:25:29,561 --> 00:25:32,689
[Door Closes]
Well, what do you want now?

351
00:25:32,764 --> 00:25:35,494
I have brought thee
a dainty tidbit
from the king's kitchen.

352
00:25:35,567 --> 00:25:37,501
Roast meat.

353
00:25:37,569 --> 00:25:40,504
At this point, roast meat
doesn't appeal to me.

354
00:25:40,572 --> 00:25:43,370
When do l...
Within the hour.

355
00:25:43,441 --> 00:25:47,036
How thou must hate me for
the mischief my foolish tongue
has caused thee.

356
00:25:47,112 --> 00:25:49,171
You ought to be press agent
forJack the Ripper.

357
00:25:49,247 --> 00:25:51,181
An ogre, you called me.
Dragon, werewolf.

358
00:25:51,249 --> 00:25:53,683
No wonder
they wanna get rid of me.
Cease.

359
00:25:53,752 --> 00:25:56,016
I feel bad enough.

360
00:25:56,087 --> 00:25:58,783
If there were aught
I could say, aught
I could do to save thee...

361
00:25:58,857 --> 00:26:00,882
Well, ain't there aught?

362
00:26:00,959 --> 00:26:02,824
Naught.

363
00:26:06,331 --> 00:26:08,265
Wait!

364
00:26:12,504 --> 00:26:14,438
Zounds! What an idea!
An idea?

365
00:26:14,506 --> 00:26:18,374
Who hast condemned thee?
'Tis Merlin,
the maker of miracles.

366
00:26:18,443 --> 00:26:20,741
What if thou
shouldst create a miracle?

367
00:26:20,812 --> 00:26:24,248
What if thou shouldst prove
a greater sorcerer?

368
00:26:24,316 --> 00:26:26,250
Doing what?

369
00:26:27,319 --> 00:26:31,722
Nay. Nay.
'Tis a foolish thought.

370
00:26:31,790 --> 00:26:34,418
A greater sorcerer than Merlin?
None such exists.

371
00:26:34,492 --> 00:26:36,426
He's the champion, huh?

372
00:26:38,430 --> 00:26:41,331
I have grown
to like thee, monster.

373
00:26:41,399 --> 00:26:43,333
'Tis sad to part.

374
00:26:45,236 --> 00:26:47,170
'Tis sad.

00:26:51,142 --> 00:26:53,076
Farewell.

[Sighs]
Within the hour.

378
00:27:15,734 --> 00:27:18,931
Well, now, if it's
a miracle they're after...

379
00:27:19,004 --> 00:27:20,938
[Humming]

380
00:27:21,006 --> 00:27:22,974
Meet the new champion.

[Orchestra]

382
00:27:57,242 --> 00:28:00,507
No, no, no, no.
All these folderols
simply to burn a man.

383
00:28:00,578 --> 00:28:03,411
Verily it grows monotonous.
Aye.

384
00:28:03,481 --> 00:28:06,075
But the Romans had
a more amusing procedure.

385
00:28:06,151 --> 00:28:08,813
They boiled their victims
in oil.

386
00:28:08,887 --> 00:28:10,980
Boiled them in oil?
[Chuckles]

387
00:28:11,056 --> 00:28:15,789
Splendid.
Hast not seen a lobster boil,
Your Majesty?

388
00:28:15,860 --> 00:28:17,794
Truly, Morgan,
thou art brilliant.

389
00:28:17,862 --> 00:28:20,763
All right,
all right, all right.
Let's get started.

390
00:28:20,832 --> 00:28:23,801
Thou knowest
this early morning air
bringeth on my vapors.

391
00:28:23,868 --> 00:28:26,393
The king speaketh.
Bring on the beast.

392
00:28:26,471 --> 00:28:29,065
Bring on the beast.!
Bring on the beast.!

393
00:28:29,140 --> 00:28:31,700
Must we have
these eternal echoes?
Bring on the beast.!

[Fanfare]

395
00:28:49,961 --> 00:28:52,828
Now, that's strange.

396
00:28:52,897 --> 00:28:54,831
The creature seemeth
in splendid spirits.

397
00:28:54,899 --> 00:28:56,833
'Twill avail him naught.

398
00:28:56,901 --> 00:29:00,337
Fire and flame will destroy him
and all his demon magic.

399
00:29:00,405 --> 00:29:02,873
Milord,
does he have to die?

400
00:29:02,941 --> 00:29:04,932
Of course he has to die.

401
00:29:05,009 --> 00:29:07,773
You certainly don't
expect me to disappoint
all these people, do you?

402
00:29:08,513 --> 00:29:12,108
Thou art to be commended,
Sir Sagramore, for thy part
in these festivities.

403
00:29:12,183 --> 00:29:14,845
Nay.
My heart weigheth heavily.

404
00:29:14,919 --> 00:29:18,116
Hear ye
the proclamation of death!

405
00:29:21,659 --> 00:29:24,856
Monster, thou hast by trial,
both just and fair,

406
00:29:24,929 --> 00:29:27,864
been found guilty
of the following crimes.

407
00:29:27,932 --> 00:29:30,730
First, of assuming
through demon wizardry...

408
00:29:30,802 --> 00:29:33,737
the form of
a man-devouring ogre,
Stay away, clouds.

409
00:29:33,805 --> 00:29:35,898
Of a fire-breathing dragon,
Good old sun.

410
00:29:35,974 --> 00:29:39,967
And of tusked
and taloned werewolf.

411
00:29:40,044 --> 00:29:43,912
Second,
of conspiring with Beelzebub
and the powers of evil...

412
00:29:43,982 --> 00:29:46,473
to bring calamity
upon this kingdom.

413
00:29:46,551 --> 00:29:49,486
Therefore, monster,

414
00:29:49,554 --> 00:29:53,149
by order
of His Sovereign Majesty
King Arthur of Britain,

415
00:29:53,224 --> 00:29:55,818
thou art hereby condemned
to perish...

416
00:29:55,894 --> 00:29:58,590
by the flame and...
[Screaming, Shouting]

417
00:30:00,732 --> 00:30:03,997
Merlin, he's bewitched!

418
00:30:05,203 --> 00:30:08,229
Have no fear, my liege.

419
00:30:08,306 --> 00:30:11,764
I shall cast a spell
upon this demon.

420
00:30:29,561 --> 00:30:33,497
- I fear thee not, monster.
- Boo.

421
00:30:39,437 --> 00:30:41,462
I, Merlin,
sorcerer to the king,

422
00:30:41,539 --> 00:30:45,498
do hereby render helpless
the evil demon
within this monster...

423
00:30:45,577 --> 00:30:47,636
and route forevermore...

424
00:30:47,712 --> 00:30:50,340
his magic wizardry,
and I command the gods...

425
00:30:50,415 --> 00:30:52,849
to wither his tongue,
to still his limbs, to...

426
00:30:52,917 --> 00:30:55,852
Psst, psst.
Smiley, you're burning up
a little there.

427
00:30:58,556 --> 00:31:01,252
Thou art the devil himself!

428
00:31:02,727 --> 00:31:04,991
Is there no end to his sorcery?

429
00:31:05,063 --> 00:31:07,258
Do you give up?

430
00:31:07,832 --> 00:31:10,960
Aha.
Just as I thought!
Hey...

431
00:31:11,035 --> 00:31:16,132
No forces of evil did cause
this mischief, my liege.

432
00:31:16,207 --> 00:31:19,438
'Twas but this bauble,
this toy,

433
00:31:19,510 --> 00:31:22,479
which any child can worketh.

434
00:31:22,547 --> 00:31:24,981
Start workething, bub.

435
00:31:28,887 --> 00:31:31,720
I command thee,

436
00:31:31,789 --> 00:31:35,418
maketh fire and flame.!
Any news?

437
00:31:36,694 --> 00:31:39,629
Maketh fire and flame!
[Laughter]

438
00:31:41,766 --> 00:31:44,030
No talent, huh?

439
00:31:44,102 --> 00:31:45,831
[Laughter Continues]

440
00:31:47,772 --> 00:31:49,706
A few words, Your Majesty.

441
00:31:49,774 --> 00:31:53,232
I am a wizard.
I'm a whiz of a wizard.

442
00:31:53,311 --> 00:31:56,405
Matter of fact,
just about the best
in the business.

443
00:31:56,481 --> 00:31:58,745
And if you don't mind
my saying so,

444
00:31:58,816 --> 00:32:02,047
it's a pretty good thing for you
I'm not quick-tempered.

445
00:32:03,922 --> 00:32:07,119
[Scoffs]
Slim, release me here.

446
00:32:07,191 --> 00:32:08,590
Come on, quickly.

447
00:32:14,933 --> 00:32:17,731
I might lose my temper here
and burn up a lot
of good acreage.

448
00:32:17,802 --> 00:32:21,067
Now, watch closely
and I'll show you what I mean.

449
00:32:21,139 --> 00:32:26,042
I have here, Your Majesty,
a common, ordinary twig.
Presto!

450
00:32:28,346 --> 00:32:31,713
[Gasping, Murmuring]

451
00:32:31,783 --> 00:32:33,842
You could imagine what
I could do with a tree.

452
00:32:35,320 --> 00:32:37,311
For my next miracle,
ladies and gentlemen...

453
00:32:37,388 --> 00:32:39,583
Desist! Desist, monster!
I prithee!

454
00:32:45,530 --> 00:32:48,624
And now, Your Majesty,
hang onto your crown be...

455
00:32:51,636 --> 00:32:53,934
because, uh, I'm about to...

456
00:32:54,005 --> 00:32:56,064
No more, monster!
I beseech thee!

457
00:32:56,140 --> 00:32:58,301
Spare my kingdom!

458
00:32:58,710 --> 00:33:00,644
Name thy terms,
and I will grant them.

459
00:33:00,712 --> 00:33:05,012
Well, I would like
to stick around here
a little while, maybe.

460
00:33:05,083 --> 00:33:07,176
Half my domains are thine.

461
00:33:07,251 --> 00:33:09,185
Oh, no. Just...

462
00:33:09,253 --> 00:33:11,278
Just a little...
little blacksmith shop
would be all right.

463
00:33:12,523 --> 00:33:15,822
A smithy. Granted.

464
00:33:15,893 --> 00:33:18,521
And if you could arrange it,
I'd like to associate...

465
00:33:18,596 --> 00:33:22,965
with these lords and ladies

00:54:45,148 --> 00:54:48,413
[Gasps]
I didn't mean to scare you.
And that's not a miracle either.

782
00:54:48,485 --> 00:54:50,510
That's just a little gadget
called a magnet,

783
00:54:50,587 --> 00:54:52,578
based on an idea cooked up
by a fellow named Ben Franklin.

784
00:54:52,656 --> 00:54:54,590
This is yours.

785
00:54:55,892 --> 00:54:58,053
'Tis a handsome gift, sire,

786
00:54:59,696 --> 00:55:01,891
but I cannot accept it.

787
00:55:01,965 --> 00:55:05,025
It would not be honorable.

788
00:55:05,101 --> 00:55:08,935
You should know this, sire.
I'm betrothed to Sir Lancelot.
I did know.

789
00:55:09,005 --> 00:55:11,565
But...
Please, honey,
let me do the talking.

790
00:55:11,641 --> 00:55:14,940
Sandy, I haven't been around
here very long. There's a lot
of things I don't know...

791
00:55:15,011 --> 00:55:16,979
how I got here,
how long I'm gonna be here...

792
00:55:17,047 --> 00:55:20,278
I do not comprehend.
Don't try to follow me.
Please. Just listen.

793
00:55:20,350 --> 00:55:25,378
What I'm getting at is this:
Would you consider
being betrothed to me?

794
00:55:25,455 --> 00:55:28,219
But Sir Lancelot.
We'll get to him later.

795
00:55:28,291 --> 00:55:32,250
Do you love him?
Lancelot is a wonderful man.

796
00:55:32,329 --> 00:55:35,492
Brave, stalwart, handsome.
Do you love him?

797
00:55:35,565 --> 00:55:37,032
A wife would be proud
of such a husband.

798
00:55:37,067 --> 00:55:39,092
Do you love him?

799
00:55:40,837 --> 00:55:42,771
No, Hank.

800
00:55:42,839 --> 00:55:45,330
Hallelujah!

801
00:55:47,410 --> 00:55:50,573
No, no. Thou must not.
'Tis most unseemly.

802
00:55:50,647 --> 00:55:52,581
Why?

803
00:55:52,649 --> 00:55:56,517
Dost thou not understand?
I am betrothed to Sir Lancelot.

804
00:55:56,586 --> 00:55:58,918
I know. I know.

805
00:55:58,988 --> 00:56:01,320
But when does he get back?
Perhaps a month.

806
00:56:01,391 --> 00:56:03,791
Well, you leave
everything to me.
I'll handle old Lance.

807
00:56:03,860 --> 00:56:05,828
But I fear for thee,
Hank.

808
00:56:05,895 --> 00:56:09,126
Sir Lancelot's anger is
known to freeze the hearts
of the most courageous.

809
00:56:09,199 --> 00:56:11,133
Sandy, don't worry.
Now, please.

810
00:56:11,201 --> 00:56:13,829
Just toddle along home
to the castle.
But, Hank...

811
00:56:13,903 --> 00:56:16,201
Don't you trust me, Sandy?

812
00:56:16,272 --> 00:56:19,070
Yes, I trust thee,
Hank.
Good. Here.

813
00:56:19,142 --> 00:56:22,111
You forgot something.
I'll see you later.

814
00:56:28,952 --> 00:56:31,318
Okay, men, shove off.

815
00:56:31,888 --> 00:56:34,322
Heave ho.

816
00:56:34,391 --> 00:56:36,985
Departeth.

817
00:56:37,060 --> 00:56:39,528
Forward!

818
00:56:54,944 --> 00:56:57,208
[Clanging]

819
00:57:16,499 --> 00:57:18,433
Sir Boss?
Yeah?

820
00:57:18,501 --> 00:57:22,096
I must warn thee.
What about? Did you get
the squeak out of there?

821
00:57:22,172 --> 00:57:24,538
Methinks I have, sire.
Behold...
[Loud Screech]

822
00:57:24,607 --> 00:57:26,700
Not entirely.
Not entirely.

823
00:57:26,776 --> 00:57:28,676
But, sire,
I must warn thee.
Yeah?

824
00:57:30,680 --> 00:57:32,773
Art occupied, blacksmith?

825
00:57:32,849 --> 00:57:37,252
Have care, sire.
Yeah, okay.
I'll fix that in a minute.

826
00:57:37,320 --> 00:57:40,653
I got a cash customer here.
Wait a minute.
What's on your mind, friend?

827
00:57:40,723 --> 00:57:42,657
Death to a scurvy knave...

828
00:57:42,725 --> 00:57:44,989
whom I shall find
before this day has ended.

829
00:57:45,061 --> 00:57:46,995
Wouldst have an edge
on my weapon!

830
00:57:48,231 --> 00:57:50,825
Yes, well, you came
to the right place, friend.

831
00:57:50,900 --> 00:57:54,301
I guess you'd like
a little edge on the lance too,
wouldn't you?

832
00:57:56,372 --> 00:57:58,306
I'll get it.

833
00:57:58,374 --> 00:58:01,571
Well, don't stand there
fidgeting. Give me
a lift here. Come on.

834
00:58:16,226 --> 00:58:20,219
By george, big fella,
you've got your dander
up today, haven't you?

835
00:58:20,296 --> 00:58:22,628
Hate to be the guy
you're looking for.

836
00:58:22,699 --> 00:58:24,496
[Screeches]

837
00:58:24,567 --> 00:58:26,797
In a minute.
In a minute.

838
00:58:26,870 --> 00:58:28,895
This man has
urgent business here.

839
00:58:28,972 --> 00:58:31,440
Somebody do you wrong?
A grievous wrong.

840
00:58:31,508 --> 00:58:34,306
Well, I can tell.
When a fella's as mad
as you appear to be,

841
00:58:34,377 --> 00:58:36,641
there's generally a woman
at the bottom of it, right?

842
00:58:36,713 --> 00:58:40,149
Thou art wise, blacksmith.
Somebody stole
your gal, huh?

843
00:58:40,216 --> 00:58:44,050
Naturally, you're gonna
take steps... long steps.

844
00:58:44,120 --> 00:58:46,714
I shall seek out
this interloper,

845
00:58:46,789 --> 00:58:49,087
and be he the size
of ten giants...

846
00:58:49,158 --> 00:58:52,252
and hath he the strength
and fury of a thousand lions,

847
00:58:52,328 --> 00:58:54,455
I shall meet him upon
the field ofhonor
and thrust him through...

848
00:58:54,531 --> 00:58:56,726
like an ox on a spit.

849
00:58:58,101 --> 00:59:01,002
Ah, but the end
shall not come swiftly.

850
00:59:01,070 --> 00:59:04,870
Mark you, the death
of this knave who calleth
himself Sir Boss...

851
00:59:04,941 --> 00:59:07,569
shall become legend,
a warning to all...

852
00:59:07,644 --> 00:59:09,805
who would covet
the betrothed of another.

853
00:59:09,879 --> 00:59:12,871
I don't blame you.
If I was in your spot...

854
00:59:15,285 --> 00:59:17,219
Did you say "Sir Boss?"

855
00:59:17,287 --> 00:59:20,381
Aye, blacksmith.
A scourge on the dog.

856
00:59:21,457 --> 00:59:23,425
Well, now...
[Clears Throat]

857
00:59:23,493 --> 00:59:26,860
Perhaps we ought to think
this over in the cool
of the evening.

858
00:59:26,930 --> 00:59:29,660
We don't wanna be too hasty
about these things.

859
00:59:29,732 --> 00:59:31,927
- What sayest thou?
- No offense, friend.

860
00:59:31,968 --> 00:59:34,266
I just don't want you
to do something that
we'll both regret.

861
00:59:34,304 --> 00:59:37,068
What wouldst suggest?
There are two sides
to every question.

862
00:59:37,140 --> 00:59:40,303
I suggest you sit down
with this fella and
try and talk it over.

863
00:59:40,376 --> 00:59:42,401
They tell me
he's a fine boy.

864
00:59:42,478 --> 00:59:44,912
A message for thee, sire.
'Tis from the Lady Alisande.

865
00:59:44,981 --> 00:59:48,109
It must be for you, friend.
No, Sir Lancelot.

866
00:59:48,184 --> 00:59:50,914
'Tis for Sir Boss here.

[Chuckles]
And here you are.

01:00:04,901 --> 01:00:07,699
If you excuse me, I have
a couple of irons in the fire.
Wait!

871
01:00:07,770 --> 01:00:09,704
I hurl the gauntlet
in thy face.

[Screeches]

876
01:00:28,958 --> 01:00:32,519
Aye. The die is cast.

877
01:00:32,595 --> 01:00:35,587
Tomorrow you joust
with Sir Lancelot.

878
01:00:35,665 --> 01:00:39,066
And the one who lives
shall become the betrothed
of Lady Alisande.

879
01:00:40,536 --> 01:00:42,800

I don't like the odds.

[Fanfare]

881
01:01:07,997 --> 01:01:10,830
All right, we're here, Merlin.
Show us some blood.

882
01:01:10,900 --> 01:01:15,633
Aye, blood.
Sir Boss's blood.
Anybody's blood!

883
01:01:15,705 --> 01:01:18,173
I will hasten
the proceedings, my liege.

01:01:25,348 --> 01:01:27,282
Fear not, my friend.

885
01:01:27,350 --> 01:01:30,808
I have cast a magic spell
upon thy evil opponent.

886
01:01:30,887 --> 01:01:35,085
I thank thee, Merlin.
I have no need
for casting of spells.

[Chuckles]

888

Be of good cheer, sire.
Perhaps couldst perform
a miracle.

01:01:49,972 --> 01:01:53,237
Afraid not.
With all this stuff on
it slows up my thinking.

What's that?

will do for a girl.

go through with it,
I'm a coward, huh?

01:07:29,712 --> 01:07:32,237
Come on, boy.
Let's trample him.

933
01:07:48,531 --> 01:07:50,761
[Shouting]

934
01:07:54,570 --> 01:07:57,767
[Crowd Laughing]

935
01:08:22,731 --> 01:08:24,665
A neat trick, Sir Boss.

936
01:08:24,733 --> 01:08:26,667
Thou hast not only
won the fair maiden,

937
01:08:26,735 --> 01:08:29,363
but given me the merriest
afternoon I've had in years.

938
01:08:29,438 --> 01:08:32,100
[Sneezes]
In years.

939
01:08:32,174 --> 01:08:34,108
Thank you, sire.

940
01:08:35,177 --> 01:08:37,805
You proud, honey?
Proud?

941
01:08:37,880 --> 01:08:41,281
Proud of my part
in this unseemly spectacle?
Oh, after all...

942
01:08:41,350 --> 01:08:43,910
Proud that thou hast made
a fool out of such
a noble gentleman?

943
01:08:43,986 --> 01:08:46,477
Well, I won, didn't I?
What do you want me to do?

944
01:08:46,555 --> 01:08:49,285
I want you to apologize
to Sir Lancelot.
Apologize?

945
01:08:49,358 --> 01:08:50,325
Yes.
For what?

946
01:08:50,359 --> 01:08:55,058
For insulting him.
What do you expect, me to be
killed like a gentleman?

947
01:08:55,131 --> 01:08:57,099
In truth, thou art
no gentleman.

948
01:08:57,166 --> 01:09:00,431
Wait. Where are you going?
I need to comfort
Sir Lancelot.

949
01:09:02,338 --> 01:09:05,307
Well, after all, sire,
it's just the rules...

950
01:09:05,374 --> 01:09:09,504
Hast thou not learned
there are no rules where
women are concerned?

951
01:09:09,578 --> 01:09:13,480
Here, take this pill.
It will ease thy gripe.

952
01:09:16,285 --> 01:09:19,220
[Banging]

953
01:09:27,329 --> 01:09:30,560
Not too close, fellas.
Pray, sire, what art
thou contriving?

954
01:09:30,633 --> 01:09:33,534
Just trying to keep busy,
keep out of trouble.

955
01:09:34,970 --> 01:09:37,131
I think I'll let you fellas
in on a little secret.

956
01:09:37,206 --> 01:09:40,369
See this gadget here?
That's a pistol.

957
01:09:40,442 --> 01:09:43,377
These little gimmicks...
bullets.

958
01:09:43,445 --> 01:09:46,812
Stand clear. Stay right there.
I'll show you how it works.

959
01:09:46,882 --> 01:09:49,680
Suppose you're out
in the woods late one night...

960
01:09:49,752 --> 01:09:52,312
and a big old wolf
all of a sudden pops up
in front of you.

961
01:09:52,388 --> 01:09:54,481
You wouldn't be scared,
would ya?

962
01:09:54,557 --> 01:09:57,219
Oh, no, you wouldn't.
Not even a little, sire?

963
01:09:57,293 --> 01:09:59,784
No, sir, because you got
your trusty pistol with you.

964
01:09:59,862 --> 01:10:01,853
All you do is just
hold it up like that,

965
01:10:01,931 --> 01:10:05,526
pull back that hammer
like that, get all set, aim...

966
01:10:12,007 --> 01:10:15,636
Where'd everybody go?

967
01:10:15,711 --> 01:10:18,612
It's all right, fellas.
You can come out now.
The big bad wolf is dead.

968
01:10:24,220 --> 01:10:26,484
I'm sorry.
I didn't mean to scare you.

969
01:10:26,555 --> 01:10:28,682
That's just a sample
of what's comin', fellas.

970
01:10:28,757 --> 01:10:31,385
The world is gonna be
chock-full of miracles...
useful miracles...

971
01:10:31,460 --> 01:10:33,951
like the printing press,
the sewing machine,
bathtubs.

972
01:10:34,029 --> 01:10:35,826
Bathtubs?
Yeah.

973
01:10:35,898 --> 01:10:38,958
[With British Accent]
You mean we're all
gonna have to take baths?

974
01:10:39,034 --> 01:10:42,162
Every single Sat...
[With British Accent]
Every single Saturday, yes.

975
01:10:42,238 --> 01:10:44,297
Greetings, milord.

976
01:10:44,373 --> 01:10:46,739
Hi, Saggy.
That's all, fellas.

977
01:10:46,809 --> 01:10:49,300
So long. See you tomorrow.
We've got big business here.

978
01:10:49,378 --> 01:10:52,438
Good night, sire.
Good-bye.

979
01:10:52,514 --> 01:10:54,448
She won't see me?

980
01:10:54,516 --> 01:10:57,815
Rumor hath it that Lancelot
and Lady Alisande are
to be wed within the week.

981
01:10:57,886 --> 01:11:00,514
But she's not in love with him.
She told me so herself.

982
01:11:00,589 --> 01:11:02,454
Female paradox.

983
01:11:03,792 --> 01:11:06,226
Well, this changes things.

984
01:11:06,295 --> 01:11:10,129
There's an old saying in
Connecticut: "When you got
to 'git', 'git."'

985
01:11:10,199 --> 01:11:12,633
Thou wouldst leave Britain?
There's nothing to
hold me here now.

986
01:11:12,701 --> 01:11:16,330
- Greetings,
O Mighty Sorcerer.
- [Hank] Hello.

987
01:11:16,405 --> 01:11:19,306
What's on your mind, honey?
Come in.

988
01:11:19,375 --> 01:11:22,902
'Tis... 'Tis about my father.

989
01:11:22,978 --> 01:11:25,970
What about your father?
He is sick
unto death, sire.

990
01:11:26,048 --> 01:11:29,279
For three days now he
has lay in a bed growing
weaker and weaker.

991
01:11:29,351 --> 01:11:31,581
Now, now. Has the doctor
been to see your father?

992
01:11:31,654 --> 01:11:33,588
No, sire. No one.

993
01:11:34,790 --> 01:11:36,724
They say he hath the plague.

994
01:11:36,792 --> 01:11:39,488
The plague?
Be gone, child!

995
01:11:39,561 --> 01:11:42,587
Clarence!
Please, Sir Boss.

996
01:11:42,665 --> 01:11:45,133
Thou canst help him.
Thou art a mighty wizard.

997
01:11:45,200 --> 01:11:48,931
We will pay you these coins,
and our pigs, we have two
of them, and a goat...

998
01:11:49,004 --> 01:11:53,703
I'm afraid you've got
me wrong. I'm not, uh...
Where do you live, honey?

999
01:11:53,776 --> 01:11:56,108
But, sire...
Wait here for me.

1000
01:11:56,178 --> 01:11:58,669
And don't be playing
around with that.
You might get hurt.

1001
01:11:58,747 --> 01:12:01,375
With this toy, sire?
Put it down!

1002
01:12:01,450 --> 01:12:03,384
Come along, honey.

1003
01:12:06,922 --> 01:12:10,323
Ridiculous that a mere trinket
should harm a grown man.

1004
01:13:11,120 --> 01:13:14,055
Ridiculous.
Utterly ridiculous.

1005
01:13:40,949 --> 01:13:42,211
Who is it?

1006
01:13:43,285 --> 01:13:45,617
A friend, ma'am.
A friend?

1007
01:13:45,687 --> 01:13:49,384
We have no friends.
Did you see the sign
outside?

1008
01:13:49,458 --> 01:13:52,325
None may enter this house
of pestilence.

1009
01:13:52,394 --> 01:13:55,989
Fly, stranger,
while there is yet time.

1010
01:13:56,064 --> 01:13:58,999
If it's all right with you,
ma'am, I'll stay a while.

1011
01:14:01,670 --> 01:14:03,763
Stay then,
and bless you.

1012
01:14:03,839 --> 01:14:05,966
Your husband?
My husband.

1013
01:14:06,041 --> 01:14:08,601
Well, I'll be careful.
I'll try not to wake him.

1014
01:14:08,677 --> 01:14:11,441
That you will not,
for he is dead.

1015
01:14:12,981 --> 01:14:15,006
[Sobbing]

1016
01:14:15,083 --> 01:14:17,017
Cry if you will, child.

1017
01:14:18,520 --> 01:14:22,183
A month ago
this was our family...

1018
01:14:22,257 --> 01:14:25,886
a fine husband,
two strapping sons,

1019
01:14:25,961 --> 01:14:27,895
a daughter.

1020
01:14:27,963 --> 01:14:29,897
Now we're alone.

1021
01:14:30,966 --> 01:14:33,196
Your sons,
are they dead too?

1022
01:14:33,268 --> 01:14:36,396
Not dead,
but better dead.

1023
01:14:36,472 --> 01:14:41,432
Years ago, the lord
of the manor planted certain
fruit trees on our farm.

1024
01:14:41,510 --> 01:14:43,569
'Twas his right.

1025
01:14:43,645 --> 01:14:46,876
His right?
'Tis the law, sire.

1026
01:14:46,949 --> 01:14:50,680
Some time ago
three of those trees
were found hewn down.

1027
01:14:50,752 --> 01:14:54,950
Our sons ran frightened
to report the crime.

1028
01:14:55,023 --> 01:14:57,685
And although they themselves
were innocent,

1029
01:14:57,759 --> 01:15:00,626
they were accused
of the crime.

1030
01:15:00,696 --> 01:15:04,723
Well, in His Lordship's
dungeon, there they lie.

1031
01:15:04,800 --> 01:15:07,667
And there they shall lie
and rot till they confess.

1032
01:15:09,037 --> 01:15:12,438
But such things can't be.
His Majesty wouldn't allow it.

1033
01:15:12,508 --> 01:15:15,443
Truly thou art a stranger.

1034
01:15:15,511 --> 01:15:17,911
[Sobbing Continues]

1035
01:15:17,980 --> 01:15:20,175
Cry, child.

1036
01:15:20,249 --> 01:15:22,240
Would I could cry
with you.

1037
01:15:30,392 --> 01:15:33,759
It's a masterpiece.
A masterpiece!

1038
01:15:33,829 --> 01:15:35,694
It needs
a touch of ermine.

1039
01:15:35,764 --> 01:15:38,631
Ermine and velvet?
'Twould clash, sire.

1040
01:15:38,700 --> 01:15:42,500
They wouldn't
be happy together.
I want ermine!

1041
01:15:42,571 --> 01:15:45,597
Oh, yes, sire.
Yes, certainly, sire.

1042
01:15:45,674 --> 01:15:47,869
Take it off.
Yes, sire. Certainly.

1043
01:15:47,943 --> 01:15:50,810
Ermine.
You shall have ermine.
[Grunts]

1044

[Sighs]

1045
01:15:57,286 --> 01:16:00,016
More hot water.
[Man]
More hot water.!

1046

1047
01:16:02,624 --> 01:16:04,615

[Man #3]
Hot water.
[Man #4] Hot water.!

1049
01:16:15,037 --> 01:16:17,437
Blasted incompetents.
They can't even keep
the water hot.

1050
01:16:17,506 --> 01:16:20,475
I don't how I've survived
all these years.
Things are bad all over.

1051
01:16:20,542 --> 01:16:23,670
Why don't you get wise
to yourself? Get acquainted
with your people.

1052
01:16:23,745 --> 01:16:27,340
My people? But I see
my people every day.

1053
01:16:27,416 --> 01:16:30,249
I don't mean these musical
comedy personalities
around the palace.

1054
01:16:30,319 --> 01:16:34,278
I mean your subjects.
How do you suppose
they feel about you?

1055
01:16:34,356 --> 01:16:38,224
My boy, they love me.
On the morrow
I journey to London.

1056
01:16:38,293 --> 01:16:42,957
All along the way my subjects
will be bowing and smiling
and doffing their hats.

1057
01:16:43,031 --> 01:16:47,161
Did you ever happen to think
that underneath those smiles
they may be hating you?

1058
01:16:47,235 --> 01:16:50,636
- Hating me?
- That's the word.

1059
01:16:50,706 --> 01:16:54,608
But why?
I'm a good king.

1060
01:16:54,676 --> 01:16:56,735
Good King Arthur
they call me.

1061
01:16:56,812 --> 01:17:00,475
It may surprise you to learn
that this country is crawling
with people who hate you.

1062
01:17:00,549 --> 01:17:04,679
Sick people, hungry people,
people who no longer hate you
because they're dead.

1063
01:17:04,753 --> 01:17:07,620
Why, sire, I can tell you...
Cease!
[Groans]

1064
01:17:07,689 --> 01:17:09,782
Oh, heavens, I am sick.

1065
01:17:12,494 --> 01:17:15,463
And it's all your fault.
Young man, I could have
you hanged for this.

1066
01:17:15,530 --> 01:17:18,727
But you won't.
'Cause I have a feeling
you believe me.

1067
01:17:18,800 --> 01:17:21,268
All these lies
about my subjects?

1068
01:17:21,336 --> 01:17:23,736
Are they lies?

1069
01:17:23,805 --> 01:17:25,898
I don't know.
I don't know.

1070
01:17:25,974 --> 01:17:29,410
What, with my ill health,
how could I know anything?

1071
01:17:29,444 --> 01:17:31,969
If you don't know, sire,
I suggest you find out.

1072
01:17:32,047 --> 01:17:34,106
Find out?
Yes.

1073
01:17:34,149 --> 01:17:37,676
We could make a trip
around the country.
Might open your eyes a little.

1074
01:17:37,753 --> 01:17:40,221
But... how 'bout my cold?

1075
01:17:40,288 --> 01:17:42,813
This could easily help your cold
and your country.

1076
01:17:43,225 --> 01:17:44,886
A miracle?

1077
01:17:44,960 --> 01:17:46,860
It could well be,
Your Majesty.

1078
01:17:48,930 --> 01:17:52,923
How worketh we
this miracle?

01:29:19,921 --> 01:29:22,583
By the morrow
there may be no king.

1227
01:29:22,657 --> 01:29:25,353
He hath need
of friends, milady.

1228
01:29:25,426 --> 01:29:28,190
I thank thee.

1229
01:29:28,262 --> 01:29:30,890
Fetch me such clothes
as a boy might wear.
But, milady...

Do as I bid.
I journey to London.
Yes, milady.

Our next offer,
three male slaves
to be sold as a group.

1232
01:29:46,981 --> 01:29:50,178
What is thy bid
for this fine specimen?

1233
01:29:50,251 --> 01:29:54,813
A bit soft, perhaps,
yet sound of wind
and limb.

1234
01:29:54,889 --> 01:29:58,450
- What is thy bid?
- Half a crown.

1235
01:29:58,526 --> 01:30:01,188
- Will anybody say
five shillings?
- Five shillings?

Who'll make it ten?
Ten shillings.

1237
01:30:04,465 --> 01:30:07,593
I'm bid. Who'll make it
one pound?

1238
01:30:07,668 --> 01:30:09,659
One pound.

1239
01:30:09,737 --> 01:30:12,399
One pound.

And for this

[Crowd Laughs]

1242
01:30:17,745 --> 01:30:20,543
Who only needs good food
and hard work...

1243
01:30:20,615 --> 01:30:23,709
to be brought to the peak
of physical perfection?

1244
01:30:23,785 --> 01:30:25,719
What is thy bid?

1245
01:30:25,787 --> 01:30:28,915
One farthing.

1246
01:30:28,990 --> 01:30:31,254
Make that a pound
or I'll have thee
boiled in oil!

1247
01:30:34,262 --> 01:30:36,196
Ten pounds for the lot.

[Auctioneer]
Ten pounds, sire?

1249
01:30:38,766 --> 01:30:42,293
Ten pounds. Remove them
to the slave quarters.

1250
01:30:42,370 --> 01:30:44,770
Sold to the gentleman
with the beard...

1251
01:30:44,839 --> 01:30:46,773
for ten pounds.

1252
01:30:46,841 --> 01:30:48,775
Here, take 'em away.

1253
01:30:50,344 --> 01:30:52,278
Our next offer...

1254
01:30:52,346 --> 01:30:55,440
is this fine specimen
of womanhood.

1255
01:30:55,516 --> 01:30:57,541
Sound of wind and limb.

1256

[Hoofbeats]
Look yonder, sire.

1257
01:31:03,324 --> 01:31:05,258
That's Tex.

01:31:06,360 --> 01:31:08,385
[Guard]
Move along.

1259
01:31:08,463 --> 01:31:10,431
That youth,
doth he not seem familiar?

1260
01:31:10,498 --> 01:31:12,489
That's no youth,
Saggy.

1261

[Auctioneer]
Who'll make it three pounds?

1262
01:31:14,635 --> 01:31:17,661
Who'll make it three pounds?
Do I hear three pounds?

1263
01:31:19,240 --> 01:31:21,936
'Tis I, sire.
Go back, Sandy. You'll only
get in trouble here.

1264
01:31:22,009 --> 01:31:25,240
I'll not go back.
I came to help thee.
Honey, this is no place for you.

1265
01:31:25,313 --> 01:31:29,807
- But, Hank...
- I would add the Lady Alisande
to our collection.

1266
01:31:29,884 --> 01:31:33,945
I'm not without friends.
I'll return soon.
Wait a minute. She... He...

1267

Forward, slaves!
Move on!

1268
01:31:48,836 --> 01:31:51,600
Greetings, O Noble King.

1269
01:31:51,672 --> 01:31:55,608
Oh, do not rise, sire.
Nor any of thee.

1270
01:31:55,676 --> 01:31:59,009
Perceive
this monumental joke.

1271
01:31:59,080 --> 01:32:01,640
My king would see his people
as they really are.

1272
01:32:01,716 --> 01:32:05,311
So what am I,
his devoted servant, to do?

1273
01:32:05,386 --> 01:32:07,513
Why, help him of course.

1274
01:32:07,588 --> 01:32:10,751
Help him to see
the miserable heart
of his domain,

1275
01:32:10,825 --> 01:32:13,589
not as a freeman,
not as a serf,

1276
01:32:13,661 --> 01:32:15,595
but as a slave.

1277
01:32:15,663 --> 01:32:18,496
Yes, my king
shall be a slave...

1278
01:32:18,566 --> 01:32:20,500
and all his friends too.

1279
01:32:20,568 --> 01:32:22,661
They shall journey
to the mines of Devon,

1280
01:32:22,737 --> 01:32:25,535
there to work and rot...

1281
01:32:25,606 --> 01:32:27,540
and eventually to die.

1282
01:32:28,776 --> 01:32:31,074
Sleep well, all of you.

1283
01:32:31,145 --> 01:32:33,409
You leave on the morrow.

1284

Nice guy.

01:32:44,892 --> 01:32:47,053
Are you asleep, honey?

1286
01:32:47,128 --> 01:32:49,824
Mm-mmm. I cannot sleep...

1287
01:32:49,897 --> 01:32:52,092
knowing that tonight
is the end of everything.

1288
01:32:52,166 --> 01:32:55,499
Oh, no. Don't you remember
the book and what it says?

1289
01:32:55,570 --> 01:32:58,767
"Love once, but love
always and forever."

[Humming]

1291
01:33:05,880 --> 01:33:08,872
You shouldn't
have come here, honey.
You'd be safe in Camelot.

1292
01:33:08,950 --> 01:33:11,145
But in Camelot
I'd not be content.

1293
01:33:11,218 --> 01:33:13,152
You mean
you're content here?

1294
01:33:13,220 --> 01:33:16,189
Whatever happens,
we're together.

1295

You really mean that,
don't you, honey?
Yes, Hank.

Always isn't
too much time

Oh, that's so true.
Don't you ever
forget it either.

1302

I won't, Hank.

01:33:49,590 --> 01:33:52,650
Are you comfortable?
Mm-hmm.

This is all we need

And tonight

We'll notify the stars

And for always

I'll not see thee again.

of a law which he himself did
place upon the statute books.

What law, sire?
If one slave of a household

1380
01:40:38,799 --> 01:40:40,892
Now with a few
well-chosen words,

1381
01:40:40,968 --> 01:40:43,334
I shall blot out
the sun forever.

[Crowd Gasps]

1389
01:41:15,002 --> 01:41:17,937
Save us, O Mighty Sorcerer!
Save us!

1390
01:41:18,005 --> 01:41:20,030
Bring back the sun!

1391

[Man]
I beseech thee.!

1392
01:41:22,142 --> 01:41:26,943
- [Woman] Release the sorcerer
in heaven's name.!
- Release him! Release him!

1393
01:41:27,014 --> 01:41:29,710
Stay this calamity.
I would rather die by the ax.

1394
01:41:29,783 --> 01:41:32,115
I'm sorry.
Even I can't stop this show.

1395
01:41:32,186 --> 01:41:34,347
[Woman]
Free him.!
[Man] Release him.!

1396
01:41:34,421 --> 01:41:36,412
Free him!

1397
01:41:36,490 --> 01:41:39,755
Set the prisoners free!
The lord mayor speaketh.

1398
01:41:39,827 --> 01:41:41,920
Set the prisoners free!

1399
01:41:43,197 --> 01:41:46,223
Very well. Hold it.

1400
01:41:47,734 --> 01:41:51,135
This is Sir Boss again.
You can come out now.

Olley, olley oxen free.

1402
01:42:09,556 --> 01:42:12,423
All right, release us.
Release His Majesty here.

1403
01:42:12,493 --> 01:42:15,428
Release
all these prisoners.
How can I thank thee?

1404
01:42:15,496 --> 01:42:17,430
Show me how to get
to Merlin's tower.

1405
01:42:17,498 --> 01:42:20,934
'Tis on the Inland Lake 'twixt
in Camelot. Thou wouldst
go there alone, unarmed?

1406
01:42:21,001 --> 01:42:23,970
Sandy's alone
and unarmed, isn't she?
Wish me luck, sire.

1407
01:42:24,037 --> 01:42:27,063
Come on. Release the king.
See you later.

1408
01:42:46,660 --> 01:42:48,594

1409

The king, is he...
Safe and sound in London.
Did you bring the pistol?

1410
01:42:51,231 --> 01:42:54,359
Aye, sir.
Where goest thou?
Sandy's in Merlin's tower.

1411
01:42:54,434 --> 01:42:56,368
Be not rash.
Let me come with thee.

1412
01:42:56,436 --> 01:42:58,904
Thanks, but you'd never
be able to keep up
on that nag.

1413
01:42:58,972 --> 01:43:03,170
Clarence, if anything happens,
it's been nice knowing you.

'Tis our friend
come to pay us a call.

1415

Something's gone wrong.

1416
01:43:20,561 --> 01:43:23,724
Whatever's gone wrong
will soon be right again.

1417
01:43:23,797 --> 01:43:27,494
Lower the drawbridge.
See that the girl
is placed in the courtyard.

1418
01:43:27,568 --> 01:43:30,298
In plain view.
Understand?

Hank, thou must
not leave me!

Well, that's it.

1429
01:44:41,174 --> 01:44:43,369
When I came to,
I was back in Connecticut.

1430
01:44:43,443 --> 01:44:46,879
And Old Man Miller,
he come looking for Tex,
was kneeling over me.

1431
01:44:46,947 --> 01:44:49,211
And Sandy?
Sandy?

1432
01:44:50,617 --> 01:44:53,177
Never saw her again.

1433
01:44:53,253 --> 01:44:55,187
Well...

Young man, the view
from the east parapet...

1435
01:44:59,026 --> 01:45:01,824
is particularly lovely
at this time of the afternoon.

1436
01:45:01,895 --> 01:45:05,262
Yes, sir.
The east parapet, mind you.

1437
01:45:05,332 --> 01:45:08,495
My niece is usually there
about this time.

1438
01:45:08,568 --> 01:45:10,900
Thank you, sir,
and good-bye.

How did you know my name?

1444
01:45:57,117 --> 01:45:59,551
I'm glad you asked me.

1445
01:45:59,619 --> 01:46:01,484
Won't you sit down?

1446
01:46:01,555 --> 01:46:04,285
This may take a little time.

1447
01:46:21,174 --> 01:46:23,404
Oh-ho-ho-ho-ho
