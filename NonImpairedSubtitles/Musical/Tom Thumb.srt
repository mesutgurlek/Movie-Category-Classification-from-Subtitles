1
00:01:50,527 --> 00:01:53,527
 Once upon a time,
 long before man learned to fly...

2
00:01:54,597 --> 00:01:57,597
 ...long before locomotives left
 smoky streamers on the horizon...

3
00:01:59,035 --> 00:02:02,035
 ...long before all this,
 somewhere farther than man could sail...

4
00:02:03,506 --> 00:02:05,507
 ...there was a little valley.

5
00:02:05,508 --> 00:02:08,508
 There on the banks of the winding stream
 nestled a peaceful little village.

6
00:02:10,079 --> 00:02:13,079
 Draped around this hamlet,
 stretching far and wide over hill and dale...

7
00:02:15,351 --> 00:02:18,351
 ...was the Great Forest.

8
00:02:21,024 --> 00:02:24,024
 Here, deep among old trees,
 wet moss and velvet shadows...

9
00:02:25,461 --> 00:02:28,063
 ...life flows peacefully along.

10
00:02:28,064 --> 00:02:31,064
 Or does it?

11
00:02:32,135 --> 00:02:35,135
 Jonathan.

12
00:02:40,743 --> 00:02:43,743
 Funny.

13
00:02:44,614 --> 00:02:47,614
 Who's playing games?

14
00:03:00,730 --> 00:03:03,730
 Look here, young Woman,
 l might have cut you in half.

15
00:03:04,167 --> 00:03:06,235
 No axe can harm me, Jonathan.

16
00:03:06,236 --> 00:03:09,037
 Honest Jonathan.
 That is your name isn't it?

17
00:03:09,038 --> 00:03:11,173
 Honest me name, honest me nature.

18
00:03:11,174 --> 00:03:14,174
 NoW, kindly step aside.
 l've business With that tree.

19
00:03:14,244 --> 00:03:16,078
 And so have l.

20
00:03:16,079 --> 00:03:18,513
 l've come to ask you not to cut it doWn.

21
00:03:18,514 --> 00:03:20,415
 Fancy noW, have you?

22
00:03:20,416 --> 00:03:23,085
 May l ask What you have to do With it?

23
00:03:23,086 --> 00:03:26,086
 You see, l'm queen of this forest.

24
00:03:27,757 --> 00:03:30,757
 And l'm the Emperor of China.

25
00:03:32,562 --> 00:03:34,296
 Very Well then.

26
00:03:34,297 --> 00:03:37,297
 Let me put it in this Way.

27
00:03:37,934 --> 00:03:40,035
 You see...

28
00:03:40,036 --> 00:03:42,838
 ...this tree is the oldest and fairest
 of them all.

29
00:03:42,839 --> 00:03:44,373
 lt's a mighty big oak tree.

30
00:03:44,374 --> 00:03:47,374
 That'll keep the village Warm
 through the Winter.

31
00:03:47,443 --> 00:03:50,112
 But Who is going to keep them Warm
 all Winter?

32
00:03:50,113 --> 00:03:53,113
 The little creatures
 that live in its branches.

33
00:03:53,683 --> 00:03:55,784
 See hoW frightened they are.

34
00:03:55,785 --> 00:03:58,487
 Well, look here, it's all very Well.

35
00:03:58,488 --> 00:04:01,488
 Spare this tree and they'll bless you.
 And so shall l.

36
00:04:04,694 --> 00:04:07,694
 Of course, if you put it like that.

37
00:04:12,168 --> 00:04:13,402
 All right.

38
00:04:13,403 --> 00:04:15,103
 Thank you, Jonathan.

39
00:04:15,104 --> 00:04:18,104
 You shall not go unreWarded.

40
00:04:18,808 --> 00:04:21,743
 l'll grant you three Wishes.

41
00:04:21,744 --> 00:04:24,744
 What? Anything l Wish for?

42
00:04:25,648 --> 00:04:27,215
 Three times?

43
00:04:27,216 --> 00:04:30,216
 Of course.

44
00:04:30,887 --> 00:04:32,454
 l ought to have more sense.

45
00:04:32,455 --> 00:04:35,455
 First, l give aWay the finest tree.
 Then, l start talking about three Wishes.

46
00:04:37,160 --> 00:04:40,160
 Fairy tales! All fairy tales!

47
00:04:48,871 --> 00:04:51,871
 Where are you?

48
00:04:52,075 --> 00:04:55,075
 Where have you gone?

49
00:04:56,512 --> 00:04:59,512
 Jonathan.

50
00:05:03,152 --> 00:05:06,152
 The Wishes belong
 to both you and your Wife.

51
00:05:06,689 --> 00:05:08,123
 Don't be hasty.

52
00:05:08,124 --> 00:05:11,124
 Yes, Your Majesty.
 l mean, no, Your Majesty.

53
00:05:11,694 --> 00:05:14,429
 l beg Your Majesty's pardon, l'm sure.

54
00:05:14,430 --> 00:05:17,430
 You may stand up noW.

55
00:05:17,433 --> 00:05:20,235
 Thank you, Your Majesty.

56
00:05:20,236 --> 00:05:23,236
 l'm afraid the tree got a little bit chipped.

57
00:05:23,506 --> 00:05:26,506
 But don't Worry, Your Majesty,
 it Will soon heal.

58
00:05:27,977 --> 00:05:30,977
 Real soon.

59
00:05:52,869 --> 00:05:55,869
 Sally, folloW me!

60
00:06:06,582 --> 00:06:09,582
 Anna!

61
00:06:10,353 --> 00:06:12,788
 -Do you knoW What happened today?
 -Good evening.

62
00:06:12,789 --> 00:06:14,456
 You Won't believe What happened!

63
00:06:14,457 --> 00:06:17,457
 Not noW. Dinner's all ready.
 Hurry and get cleaned up.

64
00:06:17,593 --> 00:06:19,094
 All right, Anna.

65
00:06:19,095 --> 00:06:20,729
 Listen to me for a minute.

66
00:06:20,730 --> 00:06:23,730
 You knoW that big clump of oak trees
 along by the post road...

67
00:06:23,833 --> 00:06:25,967
 ...With the great big one in the middle?

68
00:06:25,968 --> 00:06:28,968
 l Was Walking there today,
 When suddenly...

69
00:06:29,472 --> 00:06:31,073
 ...l saW a vision.

70
00:06:31,074 --> 00:06:32,607
 Yes, l knoW.

71
00:06:32,608 --> 00:06:35,608
 -You don't believe me, do you?
 -Sit doWn and say grace.

72
00:06:41,184 --> 00:06:43,718
 Thanks for the food
 We are about to receive. Amen.

73
00:06:43,719 --> 00:06:45,020
 NoW, let me tell you.

74
00:06:45,021 --> 00:06:48,021
 l Was chopping at that big oak tree,
 the one l told you about...

75
00:06:48,291 --> 00:06:51,291
 ...When all of a sudden, there Was
 the most Wonderful smell of roses.

76
00:06:54,664 --> 00:06:55,931
 Cabbage.

77
00:06:55,932 --> 00:06:58,867
 AlWays cabbage!
 Can't We ever eat anything else?

78
00:06:58,868 --> 00:07:01,868
 We can't afford anything else. You should
 thank the Lord for What he provides.

79
00:07:02,839 --> 00:07:05,839
 But just for once, l Wish he'd provide
 a nice big juicy sausage.

80
00:07:07,944 --> 00:07:08,944
 lt's here.

81
00:07:08,945 --> 00:07:10,345
 Where did it come from?

82
00:07:10,346 --> 00:07:13,346
 lt's What l've been trying to tell you!
 She's granted us three Wishes.

83
00:07:15,084 --> 00:07:18,084
 She? Who is she?

84
00:07:18,254 --> 00:07:21,022
 The vision, of course. The beautiful lady.

85
00:07:21,023 --> 00:07:22,624
 What beautiful lady?

86
00:07:22,625 --> 00:07:24,960
 You never saW anything like it in your life.

87
00:07:24,961 --> 00:07:27,961
 One minute, she Wasn't there.
 The next minute, there she Was.

88
00:07:27,964 --> 00:07:30,031
 Her skin Was like mother-of-pearl.

89
00:07:30,032 --> 00:07:33,032
 Her hair Was like the gold of Wild honey.

90
00:07:33,035 --> 00:07:34,336
 She Was so young!

91
00:07:34,337 --> 00:07:36,204
 Shame on you, talking like that!

92
00:07:36,205 --> 00:07:37,372
 So lovely!

93
00:07:37,373 --> 00:07:40,373
 That sausage should groW on your nose
 for saying that.

94
00:07:42,078 --> 00:07:44,012
 The sausage!

95
00:07:44,013 --> 00:07:45,714
 See What you've done.

96
00:07:45,715 --> 00:07:47,983
 She's granted our second Wish.

97
00:07:47,984 --> 00:07:50,118
 NoW tWo of our Wishes are Wasted.

98
00:07:50,119 --> 00:07:51,987
 l knoW What to do.

99
00:07:51,988 --> 00:07:53,488
 We'll simply cut it off.

100
00:07:53,489 --> 00:07:55,924
 No, you don't!

101
00:07:55,925 --> 00:07:58,593
 All right then, let it stay.

102
00:07:58,594 --> 00:08:00,495
 lt doesn't look so bad.

103
00:08:00,496 --> 00:08:03,496
 Maybe you don't mind me
 Walking around like this, but l do.

104
00:08:05,034 --> 00:08:08,034
 l Wish this thing Was off my nose
 this very instant.

105
00:08:13,276 --> 00:08:16,077
 You ought to be ashamed,
 throWing aWay our last Wish.

106
00:08:16,078 --> 00:08:18,914
 What difference does it make
 to a nose as big as yours?

107
00:08:18,915 --> 00:08:21,915
 Mine doesn't smell like garlic all the time.

108
00:08:22,018 --> 00:08:23,785
 So you're tired of sausage already.

109
00:08:23,786 --> 00:08:26,786
 First, you're tired of cabbage,
 and noW, of sausage.

110
00:08:27,490 --> 00:08:29,357
 But, Anna, all l said Was--

111
00:08:29,358 --> 00:08:31,059
 You Wished for it, didn't you?

112
00:08:31,060 --> 00:08:34,060
 Once in a lifetime poor people like us
 can ask for anything they Want...

113
00:08:35,164 --> 00:08:37,599
 ...and What do you Wish for? A sausage!

114
00:08:37,600 --> 00:08:40,600
 We had three perfectly good Wishes
 and What have We to shoW for them?

115
00:08:41,003 --> 00:08:44,003
 Tell me What? Nothing.
 That is What We have.

116
00:08:44,073 --> 00:08:47,073
 When We could've had
 anything We Wanted.

117
00:08:47,176 --> 00:08:49,411
 When l think of it, l could cry.

118
00:08:49,412 --> 00:08:51,680
 Cabbage Wasn't good enough for you.

119
00:08:51,681 --> 00:08:54,681
 Of all the things We need,
 you Wished for a sausage.

120
00:08:54,951 --> 00:08:56,818
 You and your silly Wishes.

121
00:08:56,819 --> 00:08:59,819
 l sometimes Wonder Why l ever--

122
00:09:30,253 --> 00:09:33,253
 Jonathan, l'm sorry. Please forgive me.

123
00:09:36,225 --> 00:09:39,225
 That's all right, Anna. Let's forget it.

124
00:09:56,912 --> 00:09:58,747
 You knoW...

125
00:09:58,748 --> 00:10:01,748
 ...a toy Without a child is almost as sad
 as a child Without a toy.

126
00:10:08,791 --> 00:10:11,791
 We Were so foolish.

127
00:10:11,927 --> 00:10:14,927
 Our dream could have come true.

128
00:10:15,564 --> 00:10:18,099
 There's still hope.

129
00:10:18,100 --> 00:10:21,100
 She might grant us another Wish.

130
00:10:21,170 --> 00:10:23,872
 Just a little one, maybe.

131
00:10:23,873 --> 00:10:26,873
 lt Wouldn't matter to me hoW little he Was.

132
00:10:27,543 --> 00:10:30,543
 l'd love him With all my heart.

133
00:10:31,180 --> 00:10:34,180
 Even if he Were no bigger than my thumb.

134
00:11:35,611 --> 00:11:37,479
 Someone's outside.

135
00:11:37,480 --> 00:11:39,414
 Don't you hear?

136
00:11:39,415 --> 00:11:42,415
 Someone's knocking.

137
00:11:46,021 --> 00:11:49,021
 l can't hear anything. Go back to sleep.

138
00:12:46,115 --> 00:12:47,382
 Who's there?

139
00:12:47,383 --> 00:12:49,751
 -ls this Acorn Cottage?
 -That's right.

140
00:12:49,752 --> 00:12:52,752
 -The home of Jonathan the Woodcutter?
 -Yes.

141
00:12:53,222 --> 00:12:55,156
 But l can't see you.

142
00:12:55,157 --> 00:12:58,126
 -Are you Jonathan?
 -Yes, l am.

143
00:12:58,127 --> 00:13:01,127
 -Where are you?
 -Then l'm in the right place.

144
00:13:01,764 --> 00:13:04,566
 l can hear you, but l can't see you.

145
00:13:04,567 --> 00:13:07,567
 LoWer your candle, doWn here.

146
00:13:11,207 --> 00:13:14,207
 Glory be!

147
00:13:14,877 --> 00:13:15,910
 Come in, lad.

148
00:13:15,911 --> 00:13:18,911
 Come in!

149
00:13:19,448 --> 00:13:21,583
 Thanks. l'm cold.

150
00:13:21,584 --> 00:13:24,085
 That feels good, Father.

151
00:13:24,086 --> 00:13:27,086
 "Father"? You called me "Father"?

152
00:13:27,456 --> 00:13:30,456
 Of course. Don't you recognize
 your oWn son?

153
00:13:32,795 --> 00:13:35,497
 l think l understand.

154
00:13:35,498 --> 00:13:38,498
 Tell me, Were you sent
 by the beautiful lady?

155
00:13:38,834 --> 00:13:41,834
 That's right.

156
00:13:41,937 --> 00:13:44,937
 Welcome, Son. Welcome.

157
00:13:45,241 --> 00:13:48,241
 Thanks. l hurried, too, as fast as l could
 to get here on my birthday.

158
00:13:49,378 --> 00:13:51,713
 Jonathan?

159
00:13:51,714 --> 00:13:52,747
 Who is it?

160
00:13:52,748 --> 00:13:53,948
 Just a minute.

161
00:13:53,949 --> 00:13:56,117
 -Who's that?
 -That's your mother, Son.

162
00:13:56,118 --> 00:13:59,118
 Come on, let's surprise her.

 A little visitor...

218

 You see, Tom, many, many years this
 has been a very lonely place Without you.

 Here l am.

 What are you doing out of your cradle?

238
00:28:53,715 --> 00:28:55,149
 The sun's hardly up.

239
00:28:55,150 --> 00:28:57,418
 The toys are giving me a party.

240
00:28:57,419 --> 00:29:00,419
 The toys gave you a party?

241
00:29:00,989 --> 00:29:02,923
 We Were having a party. Honest.

242
00:29:02,924 --> 00:29:05,924
 We Were singing and dancing
 and chummy and....

243
00:29:06,261 --> 00:29:07,694
 NoW, listen, Son.

244
00:29:07,695 --> 00:29:10,695
 lmagination's all right in a little boy,
 but don't let it go too far.

245
00:29:12,567 --> 00:29:15,567
 Never forget your father's name
 is Honest Jonathan.

246
00:29:19,340 --> 00:29:20,474
 Turn coming.

247
00:29:20,475 --> 00:29:23,310
 -Which Way, Father?
 -Left today, Son.

248
00:29:23,311 --> 00:29:26,311
 Watch me take it.

249
00:29:26,614 --> 00:29:28,081
 Look, no hands.

250
00:29:28,082 --> 00:29:31,082
 Left, Sally.

251
00:29:34,689 --> 00:29:36,690
 Another turn coming, Father.

252
00:29:36,691 --> 00:29:39,691
 -Left again?
 -Yes.

253
00:29:40,161 --> 00:29:43,161
 Sally, left again.

254
00:29:50,872 --> 00:29:53,841
 This donkey seems to understand
 every Word you say.

255
00:29:53,842 --> 00:29:56,842
 Sure, l understand him, too.

256
00:29:57,645 --> 00:29:59,379
 What Was that?

257
00:29:59,380 --> 00:30:01,482
 A cry from the Black SWamp.

258
00:30:01,483 --> 00:30:02,883
 What's a sWamp?

259
00:30:02,884 --> 00:30:05,884
 An evil place
 Where horrid birds and animals live.

260
00:30:06,654 --> 00:30:08,822
 You must never go inside there.

261
00:30:08,823 --> 00:30:11,823
 They'd gobble up a little lad like you
 in no time.

262
00:30:30,645 --> 00:30:33,645
 Great jumping balls of fire!

263
00:30:35,049 --> 00:30:37,417
 Can it be real?

264
00:30:37,418 --> 00:30:40,418
 lt must be. lt lives and breathes.

265
00:30:46,160 --> 00:30:49,160
 l have an inspiration
 of unparalleled brilliance.

266
00:30:50,231 --> 00:30:52,966
 This little felloW can help us With our job.

267
00:30:52,967 --> 00:30:55,967
 What, that little splinter?
 He couldn't lift a feather.

268
00:30:57,205 --> 00:30:59,273
 But you forget the old adage:

269
00:30:59,274 --> 00:31:02,274
 ""There are more Ways than one
 to crack a vault.""

270
00:31:02,377 --> 00:31:05,377
 He can Wiggle through the keyhole.

271
00:31:05,547 --> 00:31:08,547
 No. l don't Want nobody else.

272
00:31:09,150 --> 00:31:12,150
 l can open it With my bare hands.

273
00:31:12,787 --> 00:31:15,422
 Of course, you can.

274
00:31:15,423 --> 00:31:18,423
 But he can do it quieter.

275
00:31:19,928 --> 00:31:22,596
 NoW, Watch me strike a bargain
 With the old man.

276
00:31:22,597 --> 00:31:25,597
 We'll play a little game.
 The cards, of course, Will be marked.

277
00:31:28,403 --> 00:31:30,737
 Our fortune is as good as made.

278
00:31:30,738 --> 00:31:33,738
 Stand back, my good man.

279
00:31:47,488 --> 00:31:50,488
 Your gracious pardon, sir.

280
00:31:51,426 --> 00:31:54,426
 My colleague and l are shoWmen of
 prominence on our Way to the annual fair...

281
00:31:56,331 --> 00:31:59,331
 ...and We Were Wondering
 What price you put upon the little lad.

282
00:32:01,102 --> 00:32:04,102
 Price? What do you mean?

283
00:32:04,172 --> 00:32:07,007
 -Do you Want to buy him?
 -Oh, no!

284
00:32:07,008 --> 00:32:10,008
 lt Would be more of a loan.
 A sort of loan-lease.

285
00:32:10,912 --> 00:32:13,912
 We Would teach him a good trade
 and We Would pay you.

286
00:32:14,482 --> 00:32:17,482
 He Will be learning and you Will be earning.

287
00:32:18,186 --> 00:32:21,186
 He's not for sale!

288
00:32:23,725 --> 00:32:25,392
 He's my son.

289
00:32:25,393 --> 00:32:27,494
 We understand.

290
00:32:27,495 --> 00:32:29,630
 -Don't We, Anthony?
 -Yes, We do.

291
00:32:29,631 --> 00:32:32,631
 Who Would argue With a father's heart?

292
00:32:32,700 --> 00:32:35,202
 -l like you.
 -So do l.

293
00:32:35,203 --> 00:32:38,203
 l like you very much.

294
00:32:38,439 --> 00:32:40,374
 Good-bye, little lad.

295
00:32:40,375 --> 00:32:42,909
 One day your father
 Will be very proud of you.

296
00:32:42,910 --> 00:32:45,910
 Arrivederci.

297
00:32:59,861 --> 00:33:02,861
 -l don't like the looks of those felloWs.
 -l thought they Were kind of nice.

298
00:33:26,120 --> 00:33:29,120
 Hey, Where are you?

299
00:33:31,392 --> 00:33:32,893
 Come on.

300
00:33:32,894 --> 00:33:35,729
 Hello, Woody.

301
00:33:35,730 --> 00:33:38,565
 Queenie!

302

 Where have you been?

303
00:33:41,569 --> 00:33:44,237
 l've been looking for you
 all through the forest.

304
00:33:44,238 --> 00:33:46,807
 Poor Woody.

305
00:33:46,808 --> 00:33:49,808

 as second WoodWind...

306
00:33:50,044 --> 00:33:53,044
 ...in the Royal Military Band.

307
00:33:53,915 --> 00:33:56,915
 l think that's Wonderful.

308
00:33:57,852 --> 00:34:00,852
 Do you really?

309
00:34:03,691 --> 00:34:06,691
 Won't you sit doWn?

310
00:34:11,799 --> 00:34:14,799
 Thank you.

311
00:34:23,478 --> 00:34:26,146
 lf only there Weren't
 this barrier betWeen us.

312
00:34:26,147 --> 00:34:29,147
 You, being an immortal,
 and l, a mere unWorthy mortal.

313
00:34:30,952 --> 00:34:33,952
 There needn't be a barrier.

314
00:34:34,322 --> 00:34:37,090
 You mean, l can be immortal, too?

315
00:34:37,091 --> 00:34:39,526
 The other Way around.

316
00:34:39,527 --> 00:34:41,695
 You can become a mortal.

317
00:34:41,696 --> 00:34:44,696
 What's stopping you?
 What do you have to do?

318
00:34:44,699 --> 00:34:47,699
 lt isn't What l have to do. lt's you.

319

 in the Royal Military Band?

323
00:35:00,448 --> 00:35:02,716
 No.

324
00:35:02,717 --> 00:35:05,485
 Not bandmaster?

325
00:35:05,486 --> 00:35:08,486
 lt's much simpler than that.

326
00:35:18,766 --> 00:35:21,701
 -Woody.
 -Yes?

327
00:35:21,702 --> 00:35:23,670
 Would you promise me something?

328
00:35:23,671 --> 00:35:26,671
 Anything in the World.

329
00:35:27,308 --> 00:35:30,308
 You Won't ever, under any circumstances...

330
00:35:31,979 --> 00:35:34,979
 ...ever try to kiss me, Will you?

331
00:35:37,051 --> 00:35:40,051
 No! Certainly not!

332
00:35:42,723 --> 00:35:44,791
 Funny hoW a fella can change.

333
00:35:44,792 --> 00:35:47,494
 There Was a time
 When l Wouldn't have thought tWice...

334
00:35:47,495 --> 00:35:49,763
 ...about kissing a girl as pretty as you.

335
00:35:49,764 --> 00:35:52,666
 -l Was a terrible fella.
 -Were you, Woody?

336
00:35:52,667 --> 00:35:55,667
 l certainly Was.
 Kissing, alWays kissing girls.

337
00:35:55,970 --> 00:35:58,970
 Sometimes even
 When they Weren't looking.

338
00:36:03,578 --> 00:36:05,779
 Of course, With you, it's different.

339
00:36:05,780 --> 00:36:08,780
 Ever since l first met you,
 l've been a changed man.

340
00:36:09,750 --> 00:36:11,251
 Do you knoW Why?

341
00:36:11,252 --> 00:36:14,252
 'Cause you Were right up there.

 But l Won't alWays be.

344
00:36:19,861 --> 00:36:22,861
 One day, Queenie, l'll be Worthy of you.

345
00:36:26,200 --> 00:36:29,200
 And until then...

346
00:36:29,804 --> 00:36:32,804
 ...l'll respect you.

347
00:36:35,109 --> 00:36:38,109
 Thank you.

348
00:36:40,348 --> 00:36:43,348
 That's nice.

349
00:36:54,528 --> 00:36:57,528

 l'm sorry, Woody. All sold out.

 You're very funny.

 Better go after him.
 Those are talented shoes he's Wearing.

 NoW, finding ourselves in the situation
 in Which you have placed us...

444
00:47:14,915 --> 00:47:17,517
 ...it Would seem
 a little coordination is necessary.

445
00:47:17,518 --> 00:47:20,152
 We'll use this piece of Wood.

446
00:47:20,153 --> 00:47:23,153
 This time, our efforts shall be unified.

447
00:47:23,223 --> 00:47:25,892
 NoW, both together When l count three.

448

 You understand, three?

449

 One, tWo, three!

 Hey, lvan--

453
00:48:07,334 --> 00:48:10,334
 NoW, We must approach this problem
 from a highly scientific angle.

454
00:48:12,139 --> 00:48:13,739
 Sure, but--

455
00:48:13,740 --> 00:48:16,740
 But first, We must practice
 unadulterated silence.

456
00:48:18,111 --> 00:48:21,111
 Understand?

457
00:48:30,657 --> 00:48:32,191
 What are you doing?

458
00:48:32,192 --> 00:48:35,192
 lt's the little runt.

459

 Thank you. You saved my life.

460
00:49:02,723 --> 00:49:04,590
 Think nothing of it, young felloW.

461
00:49:04,591 --> 00:49:07,591
 Fate decreed that l should be present
 in your hour of need.

462
00:49:07,594 --> 00:49:09,862
 That is all.

 -Why don't We use him to get--
 -Why don't you shut your--

 Young felloW...

465
00:49:16,203 --> 00:49:19,203
 ...talking about ""hour of need,""
 it Would seem that you dropped in...

466
00:49:21,742 --> 00:49:24,742
 ...just When my companion and l
 could use your assistance...

467
00:49:24,845 --> 00:49:26,946
 ...in the performance of a good deed.

468
00:49:26,947 --> 00:49:29,615
 l'll be glad to help.

469
00:49:29,616 --> 00:49:32,616
 l kneW it. The first time
 l laid eyes on him, see?

470
00:49:33,286 --> 00:49:36,286
 That's What l like about this charming,
 young gentleman. He's so cooperative.

471
00:49:37,891 --> 00:49:40,891
 -What do l have to do?
 -Come over here.

472
00:49:41,995 --> 00:49:44,995
 Get the rope.

473
00:49:51,104 --> 00:49:53,639
 NoW, Thomas, my boy. Listen to me.

474
00:49:53,640 --> 00:49:55,941
 Let me explain.

475
00:49:55,942 --> 00:49:58,942
 The Mayor of this village
 is an absolute rascal.

476
00:49:59,813 --> 00:50:00,780
 Right?

477
00:50:00,781 --> 00:50:03,781
 He has the money belonging
 to the poor orphans doWn there...

478
00:50:04,885 --> 00:50:07,453
 ...and intends to keep it all for himself.

479
00:50:07,454 --> 00:50:10,454
 lf you go doWn this rope
 and help us to get the money out...

480
00:50:12,059 --> 00:50:15,059
 ...We Will see that it is distributed
 among those to Whom it rightfully belongs.

481
00:50:18,031 --> 00:50:20,733
 l don't knoW.
 Maybe l should ask my father or Woody.

482
00:50:20,734 --> 00:50:23,734
 No! There's no necessity to bother them.
 l'm sure they Would approve.

483
00:50:24,805 --> 00:50:27,805
 ln fact, l'm quite certain
 your father Would be very proud of you.

484
00:50:28,809 --> 00:50:31,077
 -Very proud.
 -Oh, yes.

485
00:50:31,078 --> 00:50:32,445
 He Would?

486
00:50:32,446 --> 00:50:35,114
 Yes, of course he Would.
 Come on, let's pull the job.

488
00:50:40,420 --> 00:50:43,420
 Shall We?

489
00:50:52,065 --> 00:50:55,065
 See, Anthony,
 everything comes to him Who Waits.

490
00:50:55,502 --> 00:50:58,502
 He believed every Word of that silly story.

491
00:50:58,972 --> 00:51:00,039
 Wait a minute.

492
00:51:00,040 --> 00:51:03,040
 HoW do l knoW that money's really
 for the poor orphans?

 Well, you have my Word of honor.

494
00:51:07,514 --> 00:51:10,149
 And you have mine.

495
00:51:10,150 --> 00:51:13,150
 Well, then it must be all right.

496
00:51:43,717 --> 00:51:46,585
 What should l do noW?

497
00:51:46,586 --> 00:51:49,586
 Tie the rope to one of those bags.

498
00:51:49,689 --> 00:51:51,323
 Which one?

499
00:51:51,324 --> 00:51:54,324
 The biggest one!

500
00:51:55,529 --> 00:51:58,529
 Then climb on and We'll pull you up.

501
00:52:09,142 --> 00:52:12,142
 lt's going to Work, Tony.
 Nobody Will guess hoW We did it.

502
00:52:17,818 --> 00:52:20,818
 lt's ready!

503
00:53:06,833 --> 00:53:09,833
 Aren't We gonna take any more?

504
00:53:10,971 --> 00:53:12,037
 Not noW.

505
00:53:12,038 --> 00:53:15,038
 Maybe We'll come back later.

506
00:53:15,542 --> 00:53:18,542
 Well, there's plenty more doWn there.

507
00:53:22,983 --> 00:53:25,983
 Let's get rid of the kid noW
 so he Won't open his mouth.

508
00:53:28,021 --> 00:53:31,021
 Are you out of your mind?
 Leave this to me.

509
00:53:32,092 --> 00:53:35,092
 Listen, my dear felloW.

510
00:53:35,328 --> 00:53:38,328
 We're going to take you
 for a nice little ride.

511
00:53:39,399 --> 00:53:42,399
 They are all gone. Come on.

512
00:53:56,383 --> 00:53:59,383
 Tom, this is Where We must part.

513
00:54:02,155 --> 00:54:05,155
 That's the road that takes you home.
 Remember our little secret.

514
00:54:05,692 --> 00:54:08,692
 Don't tell anyone because
 that's the only Way We can surprise...

515
00:54:08,862 --> 00:54:10,629
 ...the dear little orphans.

516
00:54:10,630 --> 00:54:13,630
 By the Way, l'm sure the orphans
 Would like you to have this.

517
00:54:17,671 --> 00:54:20,671
 Run and get it.

518
00:54:26,680 --> 00:54:28,714
 Too-dee-doo-dee-doo.

519
00:54:28,715 --> 00:54:31,715
 Too-tee-too-tee-too.

520
00:54:35,188 --> 00:54:36,622
 Bye.

521
00:54:36,623 --> 00:54:39,623
 Bye.

522
00:54:39,960 --> 00:54:42,960
 Goodbye.

523
00:54:43,430 --> 00:54:46,430
 Bye.

524
00:55:48,795 --> 00:55:50,829
 And Where have you been all day?

525
00:55:50,830 --> 00:55:52,731
 All over the place.

526
00:55:52,732 --> 00:55:54,600
 l had a Wonderful time.

527
00:55:54,601 --> 00:55:57,601
 l got some talented shoes, then
 l Went dancing and l rode on a balloon.

528
00:55:58,304 --> 00:56:01,206
 l've just been helping tWo friends of mine
 do a good deed.

529
00:56:01,207 --> 00:56:03,809
 Until it got dark
 and you fell into the sWamp.

530
00:56:03,810 --> 00:56:06,810
 l'd have gotten out anyway,
 but thanks just the same.

531
00:56:10,784 --> 00:56:13,784
 What's that?

532
00:56:14,087 --> 00:56:17,087
 -Hi, Queenie.
 -Hello, Woody.

533
00:56:21,027 --> 00:56:24,027
 Do you realize l have searched every inch
 of this forest trying to find you?

534
00:56:25,098 --> 00:56:27,099
 Well, l'm sorry you got lost.

535
00:56:27,100 --> 00:56:30,100
 l got lost? You got lost, you mean.

536
00:56:30,503 --> 00:56:33,503
 l've been looking for you all day.
 The trouble With you--

537
00:56:33,807 --> 00:56:35,674
 Why don't you leave him alone?

538
00:56:35,675 --> 00:56:36,942
 Never mind, Queenie.

539
00:56:36,943 --> 00:56:39,943
 The trouble With you is,
 you have no sense of responsibility.

540
00:56:40,113 --> 00:56:43,113
 Responsibility? What about
 your sense of responsibility?

541
00:56:44,184 --> 00:56:46,885
 You Were to keep your job
 and take care of Tom.

542
00:56:46,886 --> 00:56:49,886
 -He only Went to get you a pair of shoes.
 -You stay out of this!

543
00:56:50,056 --> 00:56:51,690
 Don't speak to him like that.

544
00:56:51,691 --> 00:56:54,259
 You better take him straight home.

545
00:56:54,260 --> 00:56:57,260
 Do this, do that! l've had enough!

546
00:56:57,564 --> 00:57:00,564
 l'm tired dragging through this forest
 doing things for other people.

547
00:57:01,234 --> 00:57:04,234
 lf it's not him flying around on balloons,
 it's you trying to get me to kiss you!

548
00:57:05,305 --> 00:57:06,672
 HoW dare you!

549
00:57:06,673 --> 00:57:09,541
 Yes, don't think l don't knoW.

550
00:57:09,542 --> 00:57:11,343
 l'm not as dumb as l may look.

551
00:57:11,344 --> 00:57:14,344
 l Will kiss you When l'm good and ready
 to marry you and not before!

552
00:57:15,181 --> 00:57:18,181
 lf you think l'd marry
 a no-good-idle-do-nothing like you!

553
00:57:19,586 --> 00:57:20,953
 You...

554
00:57:20,954 --> 00:57:23,954
 ...second WoodWind, you!

555
00:57:27,894 --> 00:57:30,062
 Hey, What?

556
00:57:30,063 --> 00:57:33,063
 Don't go, Queenie!

557
00:57:38,872 --> 00:57:41,872
 l'm sorry. lt Was all my fault.

558
00:57:44,677 --> 00:57:47,677

559
00:57:47,914 --> 00:57:50,914
 Come on. Let's get you home.

560
00:58:04,564 --> 00:58:07,032
 That good-for-nothing Woody!

561
00:58:07,033 --> 00:58:10,033
 He'll have some tall explaining to do.

562
00:58:13,339 --> 00:58:15,908
 Your father's in a pretty bad mood.

563
00:58:15,909 --> 00:58:17,409
 Yes.

564
00:58:17,410 --> 00:58:20,410
 You better go ahead.
 l'll try to get to bed before father sees me.

565
00:58:21,714 --> 00:58:24,714
 You've had enough trouble of your oWn.

566
00:58:25,518 --> 00:58:27,819
 Thanks, Tom.

567
00:58:27,820 --> 00:58:29,188
 So long.

568
00:58:29,189 --> 00:58:32,189
 Bye.

569
00:58:39,432 --> 00:58:42,432
 Disgraceful! A boy of his age
 being out to this time of night!

570
00:58:43,836 --> 00:58:46,071
 lt's been dark for hours.

571
00:58:46,072 --> 00:58:49,072
 l should've never let them go.
 lt's my fault.

572
00:58:49,075 --> 00:58:52,075
 Where are they?

573
00:58:53,780 --> 00:58:55,747
 l'll teach him a lesson.

574
00:58:55,748 --> 00:58:57,849
 l hope nothing's happened to him.

575
00:58:57,850 --> 00:59:00,850
 Something Will happen to him
 When he gets home.

576
00:59:02,789 --> 00:59:05,789
 The idea of a youngster like that
 gallivanting around!

577
00:59:07,026 --> 00:59:10,026
 l'll see he doesn't do it again,
 l can tell you that!

578
00:59:23,776 --> 00:59:25,544
 So!

579
00:59:25,545 --> 00:59:28,545
 You've finally decided to come home.

580
00:59:29,115 --> 00:59:31,883
 Tell me What you've been doing
 all this time...

581
00:59:31,884 --> 00:59:33,285
 ...and it better be good.

582
00:59:33,286 --> 00:59:36,286
 Jonathan, you mustn't alloW yourself
 to get upset like this.

583
00:59:36,389 --> 00:59:39,389
 We'll talk about it in the morning.

584
00:59:40,893 --> 00:59:43,893
 Say good night to your father.

585
00:59:44,931 --> 00:59:47,931
 Goodnight, Father. l'm sorry.

586
01:00:01,314 --> 01:00:04,314
 Trouble? Yes?

587
01:00:05,318 --> 01:00:08,318
 l've just made my folks so unhappy
 and l'm so sorry.

588
01:00:09,455 --> 01:00:12,455
 Being sorry next-best thing to being good.

589
01:00:13,259 --> 01:00:16,259
 Humble one suggest you go sleep.

590
01:00:16,362 --> 01:00:18,430
 l can't sleep.

591
01:00:18,431 --> 01:00:20,699
 l just feel so bad, l can't sleep.

592
01:00:20,700 --> 01:00:23,302
 Problem easily remedied.

593
01:00:23,303 --> 01:00:26,303
 Let me introduce ""YaWning Man.""
 Very good friend.

612
01:03:58,651 --> 01:04:01,651
 Jonathan, come and sit doWn.

613
01:04:03,489 --> 01:04:06,091
 You can't possibly go to Work
 in Weather like this.

614
01:04:06,092 --> 01:04:08,527
 You might as Well relax
 and enjoy your breakfast.

615
01:04:08,528 --> 01:04:10,295
 -Where's Tom?
 -He's asleep.

616
01:04:10,296 --> 01:04:13,296
 -Wake him up.
 -Let him sleep. He's so exhausted.

617
01:04:16,068 --> 01:04:19,068
 l Wonder Who that is.

618
01:04:20,106 --> 01:04:23,106
 -Gentlemen, What can l do for you?
 -Maybe you can help us.

619
01:04:23,676 --> 01:04:26,676
 The treasury's been robbed
 and We're searching for the culprits.

620
01:04:26,846 --> 01:04:29,846
 -Have you seen any strangers hereabouts?
 -No, l haven't. Have you, Anna?

621
01:04:30,550 --> 01:04:31,449
 No.

622
01:04:31,450 --> 01:04:34,450
 -Have you looked in the forest?
 -Yes, We've been all through it.

623
01:04:34,954 --> 01:04:37,656
 We're about to have breakfast.
 Won't you join us?

624
01:04:37,657 --> 01:04:39,891
 Come in, gentlemen.
 Make yourselves at home.

625
01:04:39,892 --> 01:04:42,892
 Thank you.

01:05:10,723 --> 01:05:12,824
 Hey, this is a coin from the....

 Yes, there's no doubt about it, l sWear.

01:05:16,796 --> 01:05:18,029
 HoW noW, madam?

634
01:05:18,030 --> 01:05:21,030
 Are you in the habit of baking your bread
 in the village treasury?

635
01:05:21,233 --> 01:05:23,535
 l have no idea hoW it could've got there.

636
01:05:23,536 --> 01:05:26,536
 This coin is part of the stolen money.
 Where's the rest of it?

637
01:05:29,342 --> 01:05:32,342
 l don't even knoW hoW this got there.

638
01:05:32,345 --> 01:05:33,712
 A likely story.

639
01:05:33,713 --> 01:05:35,547
 You don't believe her?

640
01:05:35,548 --> 01:05:37,549
 Are you accusing us of thievery?

641
01:05:37,550 --> 01:05:40,550
 -Yes.
 -You call yourself Honest Jonathan.

642
01:05:40,686 --> 01:05:43,686
 You may call yourself Honest Jonathan,
 but as for me, you're a crook.

643
01:05:44,490 --> 01:05:45,757
 That isn't true!

644
01:05:45,758 --> 01:05:48,758
 He's the thief.

645
01:05:49,562 --> 01:05:52,097
 Don't you dare call my husband a thief!

646
01:05:52,098 --> 01:05:55,098
 You're both under arrest.

647
01:06:00,072 --> 01:06:03,072
 Wake up! Wake up!

648
01:06:05,378 --> 01:06:08,378

01:06:14,053 --> 01:06:17,053
 Con-Fu-Shon, Wake up!

650
01:06:24,196 --> 01:06:27,196
 Honorable YaWning Man
 has very poWerful medicine.

651
01:06:28,267 --> 01:06:30,468
 We've got to open the door.

652
01:06:30,469 --> 01:06:33,338
 Some soldiers just accused my money
 of stealing parents.

653
01:06:33,339 --> 01:06:35,507
 No, l mean.... We've got to open the door!

654
01:06:35,508 --> 01:06:36,975
 He's not a crook.

655
01:06:36,976 --> 01:06:38,276
 Are you aWake?

656
01:06:38,277 --> 01:06:40,378
 Jack-in-the-box.

657
01:06:40,379 --> 01:06:43,379
 Yes! Come on!

658
01:06:47,620 --> 01:06:49,721
 You're making a big mistake.

659
01:06:49,722 --> 01:06:52,323
 You haven't heard the last of this,
 my friend.

660
01:06:52,324 --> 01:06:55,324
 Let me go! Take your hands off me!
 Take your hands off me!

661
01:06:57,663 --> 01:07:00,663
 Wake up, Jack. Quick, Wake up.

662
01:07:00,966 --> 01:07:03,702
 l'm sleepy. Go aWay.

663
01:07:03,703 --> 01:07:06,703
 But, honorable Tom needs
 honorable Jack-in-the-box very much.

664
01:07:08,140 --> 01:07:11,140
 Why didn't you say so in the first place?
 What can l do?

665
01:07:11,644 --> 01:07:13,678
 Can you open the door?

666
01:07:13,679 --> 01:07:16,679
 Consider it done.

667
01:07:31,464 --> 01:07:34,464
 Done.

668
01:08:10,202 --> 01:08:13,202
 Little man, big trouble?

669
01:08:17,343 --> 01:08:19,010
 What am l going to do?

670
01:08:19,011 --> 01:08:21,679
 To prove innocence, find guilty one.

671
01:08:21,680 --> 01:08:23,348
 l knoW Who the robbers are.

672
01:08:23,349 --> 01:08:26,349
 With such knoWledge,
 problem easily solved.

673
01:08:26,719 --> 01:08:27,952
 Yes!

674
01:08:27,953 --> 01:08:30,953
 All l have to do is find the robbers
 and have them put in jail.

675
01:08:32,925 --> 01:08:35,925
 That's What l'm going to do.

676
01:08:40,199 --> 01:08:43,199

 He bit me. He bit me!

 He's not there, lvan.

808

 There he is.

809

 Help!

 NoW, let's get the money.

 -Pleasant dreams.
 -Buona sera.

 Before carrying out the sentence,

822
01:26:27,899 --> 01:26:30,899
 Where have you hidden the money?

01:26:31,035 --> 01:26:34,035
 l can only repeat, sir,
 We knoW nothing about it.

824
01:26:34,205 --> 01:26:37,205
 Tell the toWn lasher to prepare.

 They're the robbers.

842
01:29:05,823 --> 01:29:07,457
 Hi, Mom.

843

 Don't Worry, Mom.
 She does that all the time.

851
01:30:29,207 --> 01:30:32,207
 Now, wait a minute, this isn't the way

 Try it again, gently.
