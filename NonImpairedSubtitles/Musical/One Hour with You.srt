Now listen, men.
Spring is here...

2
00:01:14,287 --> 00:01:18,444
and spring is a dangerous time
of the year, especially in Paris.

3
00:01:18,543 --> 00:01:22,089
The wanderlust is in the air.
Travelers are coming here from everywhere -

4
00:01:22,192 --> 00:01:24,613
from Cincinnati and Singapore.

5
00:01:24,720 --> 00:01:27,753
- Now, what do they come for?
- [Together] We know.

6
00:01:27,856 --> 00:01:33,158
That's right. Chicago packers
don't come here for a plate of cold cuts.

7
00:01:33,264 --> 00:01:37,038
Big planters don't come
from Brazil just for nuts.

8
00:01:37,135 --> 00:01:40,616
From Norway and Sweden,
they don't come here to fish.

9
00:01:40,719 --> 00:01:45,356
But whether they come from
Amsterdam or Birmingham or Siam...

10
00:01:45,455 --> 00:01:48,008
we let them do whatever they wish.

11
00:01:48,111 --> 00:01:50,054
We let them play in any way...

12
00:01:50,159 --> 00:01:52,014
as long as they're willing to pay.

13
00:01:52,112 --> 00:01:53,421
[Together]
That's okay.

14
00:01:53,520 --> 00:01:55,723
But spring is here.

15
00:01:55,823 --> 00:01:59,336
And after dark, our cafés are empty.

16
00:01:59,440 --> 00:02:03,302
But every park has
standing room only every night.

17
00:02:03,407 --> 00:02:05,829
- Now that's wrong.
- That's right.

18
00:02:05,935 --> 00:02:08,521
The situation is not funny.

19
00:02:08,623 --> 00:02:11,623
Our best cafés are losing money.

20
00:02:11,727 --> 00:02:13,866
We must clean up the public parks.

21
00:02:13,967 --> 00:02:16,171

Cleaner parks and more prosperity.

26
00:02:51,471 --> 00:02:54,505
The French Revolution.

27
00:02:55,632 --> 00:02:58,185
Hey! You can't make love in public.

28

If I wanted to start something

Couldrt I call her to my office?

So, that's what goes on
in your office!

Darling, we have been married

And for three years,
you've gone to your office every day.

Sweetheart, take my word -
This Martel girl -

- I don't believe you!

But it was my fault.
I was wrong.

You have a right to be wrong.

- Oh, darling.
- My dear, how excited you seem.

712
00:55:02,988 --> 00:55:05,770
I just had a dream,
a terrible dream.

713
00:55:05,868 --> 00:55:09,513
I dreamed that last night, when you
were gone, I was downstairs alone and -

714
00:55:09,612 --> 00:55:11,173
Yes, yes? Go on.

715
00:55:11,276 --> 00:55:14,659
Suddenly a man took hold of me.
I - I struggled, and he -

716
00:55:14,764 --> 00:55:16,586
- Choked you?
- No.

717
00:55:16,684 --> 00:55:18,506
- Shot you?
- No.

718
00:55:18,604 --> 00:55:20,426
What did he do?

719
00:55:21,644 --> 00:55:23,467
He kissed me.

720
00:55:23,564 --> 00:55:25,899
Oh. Kissed you.

Someone I know?

724
00:55:40,940 --> 00:55:43,045
- He's your pal.
- What a pal!

725
00:55:43,148 --> 00:55:45,831
- It was Adolph.
- Oh, no. Not Adolph.

726
00:55:45,932 --> 00:55:49,544
[Laughs] That's a scream.
It couldn't be Adolph, even in a dream!

727
00:55:51,276 --> 00:55:53,381
Adolph!

00:59:21,100 --> 00:59:23,467
Right. Right.

785
00:59:24,780 --> 00:59:28,675
Your-Your wife just -
just asked me something.

786
00:59:29,739 --> 00:59:31,779
And then I answered.

787
00:59:31,884 --> 00:59:34,469
Then another question,
and then another answer.

788
00:59:34,572 --> 00:59:37,289
One question follows an answer.
You know? [Chuckling]

789
00:59:37,388 --> 00:59:40,257
Eight minutes -
Eight minutes can go like that!

790
00:59:40,364 --> 00:59:41,924
Yes. Yes.

791
00:59:42,028 --> 00:59:44,581
Then you, uh -
you got out of the car.

792
00:59:44,684 --> 00:59:46,921
You went to the house,
and at the door...

793
00:59:47,019 --> 00:59:49,059
my wife handed you the key.

794
00:59:49,164 --> 00:59:50,986
You unlocked the door...

795
00:59:51,084 --> 00:59:54,379
and after a short conversation,
you went in.

796
00:59:54,476 --> 00:59:58,666
This was exactly 2:51.

797
00:59:58,764 --> 01:00:01,098
Uh -Am I boring you?

798
01:00:01,196 --> 01:00:03,432
Oh, not at all, Professor.

799
01:00:03,532 --> 01:00:07,242
Uh, yes, y-your wife -
your wife said...

800
01:00:07,339 --> 01:00:09,674
"Wort you come up
and have a little brandy?"

801
01:00:09,772 --> 01:00:13,481
And I said,
"Ah, a little brandy can't hurt."

802
01:00:14,956 --> 01:00:17,127
- So, I - I went up.
- Yes.

803
01:00:17,228 --> 01:00:20,425
And, uh -
And you had the brandy?

804
01:00:21,676 --> 01:00:23,237
Yes.

805
01:00:23,340 --> 01:00:25,445
Was it good brandy, Doctor?

806
01:00:25,548 --> 01:00:27,435
Excellent, Professor.

807
01:00:28,428 --> 01:00:31,941
You drank this brandy
from 2:53...

808
01:00:33,099 --> 01:00:34,954
to 4:44.

809
01:00:37,324 --> 01:00:40,553
Professor, I assure you...

810
01:00:40,652 --> 01:00:43,335
that there is
absolutely nothing wrong.

811
01:00:44,940 --> 01:00:47,787
We just -We just had a chat...

812
01:00:47,884 --> 01:00:49,706
and a few laughs.

813
01:00:49,804 --> 01:00:53,153
You know, y-your wife -
your wife is very amusing.

814
01:00:53,259 --> 01:00:56,009
Yes, everyone says so.
It must be true.

815
01:00:56,108 --> 01:00:59,621
Now, Professor,
all appearances are against me.

816
01:00:59,723 --> 01:01:01,763
I know. I know.
But let me tell you again -

817
01:01:01,868 --> 01:01:04,072
Not another word, Doctor.

818
01:01:04,171 --> 01:01:07,401
- I believe you.
- Thank you.

819
01:01:07,500 --> 01:01:09,922
You're very welcome.
I believe you.

820
01:01:11,084 --> 01:01:14,532
But no one else will. [Chuckles]
Too bad, isn't it?

821
01:01:14,635 --> 01:01:17,417
I just came up here this morning
to ask you...

822
01:01:17,515 --> 01:01:20,832
if you would appear,
voluntarily, as a...

823
01:01:22,092 --> 01:01:25,572
shall we say, witness
in my divorce suit?

824
01:01:25,676 --> 01:01:27,945
[Chuckles]

825
01:01:28,044 --> 01:01:30,597
Professor, please believe me.

826
01:01:31,596 --> 01:01:33,701
I'm an innocent man.

827
01:01:33,804 --> 01:01:37,382
I'm not guilty.
And neither is Mitzi.

828
01:01:37,484 --> 01:01:39,371
I mean - I mean, your wife.

829
01:01:39,468 --> 01:01:42,315
My friend -
May I call you my friend?

830
01:01:42,412 --> 01:01:45,030
- Please.
- My friend, nobody is guilty.

831
01:01:45,132 --> 01:01:49,474
I have a theory that nobody
is responsible for their actions.

832
01:01:49,580 --> 01:01:52,231
Right!
That's absolutely right.

833
01:01:52,331 --> 01:01:56,106
Our doings are controlled by circumstances
over which we have no control.

834
01:01:56,204 --> 01:02:00,066
Oh, excellent.
Truer words have never been spoken.

835
01:02:00,172 --> 01:02:03,303
Therefore, nobody can
be held responsible for his actions.

836
01:02:03,404 --> 01:02:06,153
Oh, what a beautiful thought,
Professor.

837
01:02:06,252 --> 01:02:08,139
You know -
You know that you're a poet?

838
01:02:08,236 --> 01:02:12,360
[Chuckles] This, of course, has nothing
whatever to do with our case.

839
01:02:14,859 --> 01:02:16,834
- Good morning, Professor.
- Madame.

840
01:02:16,939 --> 01:02:19,306
Ah, I'm so glad you dropped in.

841
01:02:19,403 --> 01:02:21,291
We should see each other
more often.

842
01:02:21,387 --> 01:02:25,162
[Chuckles]
I'm afraid the doctor doesn't like me.

843
01:02:25,260 --> 01:02:28,260
Oh, Professor.
Where did you get such an idea?

844
01:02:29,484 --> 01:02:31,589
Oh, by the way, how's Mitzi?

845
01:02:31,691 --> 01:02:33,546
- Mitzi?
- Yes.

846
01:02:33,644 --> 01:02:37,027
Oh, Mitzi. Uh, let me see.

847
01:02:37,132 --> 01:02:39,336
She left this morning for Lausanne.

848
01:02:39,436 --> 01:02:41,475
- Lausanne?
- Mmm.

849
01:02:41,580 --> 01:02:44,231
- Oh, to see her mother.
- I suppose so.

850
01:02:45,579 --> 01:02:48,895
- I hope nothing's happened to her mother.
- To her mother?

851
01:02:49,004 --> 01:02:51,208
No, I don't think so.

852
01:02:51,308 --> 01:02:54,723
Well, we'll see.
I'm sorry, but I must be going now.

853
01:02:54,827 --> 01:02:57,958
Well, you must come again sometime.

854
01:02:58,059 --> 01:03:01,158
And when you write Mitzi,
you'll give her my best regards, won't you?

855
01:03:01,260 --> 01:03:03,943
Oh, I surely will.
And yours, Doctor?

856
01:03:04,939 --> 01:03:06,762
Please.

857
01:03:06,859 --> 01:03:08,998
- Well, good-bye.
- Good-bye.

858
01:03:09,100 --> 01:03:10,987
- Good-bye.
- Good-bye.

859
01:03:22,380 --> 01:03:25,446
Don't you think
he behaved strangely?

860
01:03:25,547 --> 01:03:27,435
Oh, no, not at all.

861
01:03:33,164 --> 01:03:37,026
Andre? There's something wrong
between the professor and Mitzi.

862
01:03:37,132 --> 01:03:39,368
Oh. What an idea, Colette.

863
01:03:39,468 --> 01:03:42,315
I feel it. I feel it.
My womars instinct tells me.

864
01:03:43,500 --> 01:03:45,955
And there's a man in it.

865
01:03:46,059 --> 01:03:49,442
Andre?
You know who the man is?

866
01:03:49,547 --> 01:03:52,231
- Who?
- This Russian artist Rodovsky.

867
01:03:52,331 --> 01:03:55,179
- No. No, it's not Rodovsky.
- How do you know?

868
01:03:55,276 --> 01:03:58,789
I don't know. I don't know.
My- My instinct tells me it's not Rodovsky.

869
01:03:58,891 --> 01:04:00,996
I tell you, it's Rodovsky.

870
01:04:01,100 --> 01:04:02,987
All right. All right.

871
01:04:03,083 --> 01:04:05,352
Everybody- Everybody is entitled
to his own opinion.

872
01:04:05,452 --> 01:04:08,300
[Chuckles]
Let's hope it's Rodovsky.

873
01:04:09,292 --> 01:04:12,838
You're right, Andre.
It's not Rodovsky.

874
01:04:12,939 --> 01:04:14,827
Now I know who it is.

875
01:04:14,924 --> 01:04:17,858
- Who?
- That American - Goldberg.

876
01:04:19,659 --> 01:04:21,547
Maybe - Maybe you're right.

877
01:04:21,643 --> 01:04:24,229
I - I wouldn't be surprised
if it were Goldberg.

878
01:04:33,867 --> 01:04:35,972
Andre!

879
01:04:36,076 --> 01:04:38,465
- I have it now.
- Who?

880
01:04:38,572 --> 01:04:41,059
No. No. No, it can't be.

881
01:04:50,699 --> 01:04:53,514
# I didn't want to do what I did
but I did #

882
01:04:53,611 --> 01:04:56,066
#And now what can I do #

883
01:04:56,172 --> 01:04:58,855
# I'd better take a trip
Yes, a trip on a ship #

884
01:04:58,956 --> 01:05:01,509
#To China or Peru #

885
01:05:01,612 --> 01:05:03,978
# I knew the moment
that she began #

886
01:05:04,075 --> 01:05:06,661
#Where it was leading to #

887
01:05:06,763 --> 01:05:09,414
# It might have happened
to any man #

888
01:05:09,516 --> 01:05:11,752
# It might have happened
to you #

889
01:05:11,851 --> 01:05:14,469
# It was late
and she was lonely #

890
01:05:14,572 --> 01:05:16,993
#And she begged
for sympathy only #

891
01:05:17,100 --> 01:05:20,067
# Now I ask you
what would you do #

892
01:05:20,171 --> 01:05:22,059
# In a case like that #

893
01:05:22,156 --> 01:05:24,774
# If her head
was on your shoulder #

894
01:05:24,876 --> 01:05:27,363
#And she grew
a little bit bolder #

895
01:05:27,467 --> 01:05:30,336
# Now I ask you
what would you do #

896
01:05:30,443 --> 01:05:32,330
#With a girl like that #

897
01:05:32,427 --> 01:05:35,078
# Do you think
you could resist her #

898
01:05:35,180 --> 01:05:37,667
# Do you think
you wouldn't have kissed her #

899
01:05:37,771 --> 01:05:40,521
#Would you treat her
like a sister #

900
01:05:40,619 --> 01:05:42,791
# Come on, be honest, mister #

901
01:05:42,892 --> 01:05:45,444
# If you saw her
turn the light out #

902
01:05:45,548 --> 01:05:47,969
#Would you get your hat
and get right out #

903
01:05:48,076 --> 01:05:50,759
# Now I ask you
what would you do #

904
01:05:50,859 --> 01:05:53,063
[Chuckles]
#That's what I did too #

905
01:05:53,164 --> 01:05:55,814
# It was late
and she was lonely #

906
01:05:55,915 --> 01:05:58,599
#And she begged
for sympathy only #

907
01:05:58,699 --> 01:06:01,481

01:06:01,579 --> 01:06:03,466

909
01:06:03,563 --> 01:06:06,346

910
01:06:06,443 --> 01:06:09,226
#And she grew
a little bit bolder #

911
01:06:09,324 --> 01:06:11,658
# Oh, I ask you
what would you do #

912
01:06:11,755 --> 01:06:13,643
#With a girl like that #

913
01:06:13,740 --> 01:06:16,423
# Do you think

914

# Do you think

915
01:06:19,307 --> 01:06:21,217
#Would you treat her
like your sister #

916
01:06:21,323 --> 01:06:24,171
# Oh, come on
Be honest, mister #

917
01:06:24,267 --> 01:06:26,886
# If you had a sweet
and pure wife #

918
01:06:26,987 --> 01:06:29,354
#Wouldrt you be faithful
to your wife #

919
01:06:29,452 --> 01:06:32,005
# Now I ask you
what would you do #

920
01:06:32,107 --> 01:06:34,344
# Heh, that's what I did too ##

921
01:07:37,163 --> 01:07:38,985
Darling.

922
01:07:41,323 --> 01:07:44,390
- Have you had any breakfast?
- Yes.

923
01:07:44,491 --> 01:07:46,596
Was -Was it a good breakfast?

924
01:07:46,700 --> 01:07:49,034
Marvelous.

925
01:07:49,132 --> 01:07:51,335
Had a - a good night's sleep?

926
01:07:51,435 --> 01:07:53,323
Yes. Wonderful.

927
01:07:53,420 --> 01:07:56,103
- Feel strong?
- Great!

928
01:07:56,204 --> 01:07:58,244
Strong enough to face -

929
01:07:58,347 --> 01:08:01,576
to take a-a nice -
a nice, long walk with me?

930
01:08:01,675 --> 01:08:03,682
I'd love it.

931
01:08:03,788 --> 01:08:05,675
Sit down, darling.

932
01:08:08,907 --> 01:08:12,649
Darling,
I've got to disillusion you.

933
01:08:12,747 --> 01:08:14,886
Your instinct was right.

934
01:08:14,987 --> 01:08:18,631
There is something wrong
in Mitzi's marriage.

935
01:08:18,731 --> 01:08:21,153
Didrt I tell you?
Didrt I tell you?

936
01:08:21,260 --> 01:08:24,009
And who wouldn't believe me?
[Laughing]

937
01:08:24,107 --> 01:08:26,726
Oh, darling, tell me.
Tell me all about it.

938
01:08:26,828 --> 01:08:29,380
You were right.
