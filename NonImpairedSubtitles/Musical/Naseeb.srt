1
00:00:47,060 --> 00:00:51,394
Keep the luggage properly.

2
00:00:53,367 --> 00:00:55,028
Shanti, keep these fruits,
for the journey.

3
00:00:55,102 --> 00:00:59,471
Look after the kids. It gets
pretty cold in koyna.

4
00:00:59,539 --> 00:01:02,702
You are behaving, as if we
are going to simla!

5
00:01:02,943 --> 00:01:05,503
I am nervous, my wife and
kids are going alone for the...

6
00:01:05,579 --> 00:01:10,949
...first time. Mrs Gomes hasn't
come as yet- here they come!!

7
00:01:13,453 --> 00:01:18,254
Julie, come on hurry up.

8
00:01:18,325 --> 00:01:22,125
Only 5 minutes are left.
Hurry up.

9
00:01:22,195 --> 00:01:28,464
My daughter is always after
sweets for the whole day.

10
00:01:28,535 --> 00:01:34,269
Ok, get in now. Hurry.
- As soon as you get the letter...

11
00:01:34,341 --> 00:01:39,472
...come immediately to koyna.
Ok, but where is john.

12
00:01:44,518 --> 00:01:47,646
"John, come soon, bus is
leaving. Hurry up."

13
00:01:53,193 --> 00:01:56,026
"I thought you won't come, vicky.
- How can that be. I was..."

14
00:01:56,096 --> 00:02:00,430
...iooking for this coat. Wear it.
- And happy birthday to you<i>...</i>

15
00:02:00,500 --> 00:02:05,164
i got a fruit cake for you<i>. - </i>
wow. Thanks a lot.

16
00:02:05,238 --> 00:02:09,174
"Why are you spoiling his habits,
son. When i started giving him..."

17
00:02:09,242 --> 00:02:11,710
...a present he refused & said he
will take it only after eating a...

18
00:02:11,945 --> 00:02:15,381
...cake from his friends hands.
If you do not reach his party...

19
00:02:15,449 --> 00:02:17,747
...he will not celebrate
his birthday in future.

20
00:02:17,984 --> 00:02:22,546
"Why not, he may be anywhere
but my cake will reach him."

21
00:02:22,622 --> 00:02:27,059
Come hurry up. Bye.

22
00:02:33,533 --> 00:02:37,629
Look after my husband<i>. - </i> i'll
look after him so well that...

23
00:02:37,704 --> 00:02:40,468
...you won't recognise him
on your return.

24
00:02:49,349 --> 00:02:51,613
"Drop vicky, and let's go to the
hotel<i>... - </i> why?"

25
00:02:51,685 --> 00:02:56,054
"If we don't reach, they will make
mince meat of our friends."

26
00:02:58,458 --> 00:03:03,293
You owe the hotel rs. 400<i>. - </i>
you can keep my carriage!

27
00:03:03,363 --> 00:03:08,062
What will i do with it. Do i run
the hotel or the carriage?

28
00:03:08,134 --> 00:03:12,298
"Ok, take it from namdev<i>. - </i>
who is he? Is he the owner?"

29
00:03:12,372 --> 00:03:20,370
"Your servant, sir. Don't insult my
friends, give it to them."

30
00:03:20,447 --> 00:03:25,749
Cut it from namdev's salary
if they don't pay up.

31
00:03:25,986 --> 00:03:28,614
How much is his salary that i
should cut from it?

32
00:03:28,688 --> 00:03:32,681
Why waste time. Give him
your rings.

33
00:03:32,759 --> 00:03:37,196
These three rings has come from
his three wives in dowry<i>...</i>

34
00:03:37,264 --> 00:03:39,732
Iook after them.

35
00:03:43,436 --> 00:03:50,638
Why do you wish to mortgage
your rings for such friends.

36
00:03:50,710 --> 00:03:56,615
"You two, i must get my money
by this month end. Ok?"

37
00:04:01,054 --> 00:04:03,648
"This man owes us rs 4 for
liquor, and is not giving."

38
00:04:03,723 --> 00:04:06,191
"Namdev, get the money."

39
00:04:06,259 --> 00:04:11,162
He drinks liquor from a tea cup
and doesn't pay up!

40
00:04:11,231 --> 00:04:18,967
My money is finished. Here is a
rs 5 lottery ticket for 5 lakhs<i>...</i>

41
00:04:19,039 --> 00:04:28,380
"take it, my luck is run out.
But you may get it."

42
00:04:30,317 --> 00:04:33,684
"Friends, what do you say? A rs
5 ticket for 4, should we pool<i>...</i>"

43
00:04:33,753 --> 00:04:39,658
"...in rs.1 each and buy it? Bring
it, we will buy it."

44
00:04:42,696 --> 00:04:44,596
Whom will the lottery ticket
remain with?

45
00:04:44,664 --> 00:04:48,361
"Anybody can keep it, we a
re all friends."

46
00:04:48,435 --> 00:04:54,601
"No, in money matters there are
no friends or relatives<i>...</i>"

47
00:04:54,674 --> 00:05:00,169
let us draw. Whoever is
highest keeps it.

48
00:05:11,691 --> 00:05:14,489
It seems that the ticket
will stay with jagdish.

49
00:05:14,561 --> 00:05:18,554
"Don't run away with it<i>. - </i> what
are you talking, i will give my..."

50
00:05:18,632 --> 00:05:25,538
...life for my friends<i>. - </i> let's
shake our hands on it.

51
00:05:57,070 --> 00:06:03,339
"Get up father, it is quite late.
Look, i am leaving the kids at..."

52
00:06:03,410 --> 00:06:06,641
...mother's place and getting the
rations. You reach there.

53
00:06:49,322 --> 00:06:54,453
"Auntie, we have won the lottery."

54
00:06:54,527 --> 00:07:10,899
"We have become rich, my friends
will be happy. I'll ring namdev."

55
00:07:10,977 --> 00:07:22,650
"Raghu, my friend, we have
won the lottery."

56
00:07:22,722 --> 00:07:30,424
Let us embrace friend!

57
00:07:53,286 --> 00:07:56,016
"You had said, you will give your
life for your friends<i>...</i>"

58
00:07:56,089 --> 00:07:58,580
"ok, give your life &
i will take the money."

59
00:08:09,135 --> 00:08:19,511
"Police, i am jagdish, just now
my friend namdev has knifed me."

60
00:08:38,965 --> 00:08:44,130
"Jagdish, we have just
won the lottery."

61
00:08:57,183 --> 00:09:00,880
Who has done all this?

62
00:09:05,558 --> 00:09:11,519
"Namdev, what have you done? - 
i haven't done anything."

63
00:09:11,598 --> 00:09:15,398
He was already knifed when i
came in. Why are you lying?

64
00:09:15,468 --> 00:09:17,902
For money you have
killed my friend!

65
00:09:17,971 --> 00:09:21,600
I swear by my sons.
I haven't killed him.

66
00:09:21,674 --> 00:09:24,666
Who will believe you. There
is blood on your shirt<i>...</i>

67
00:09:24,911 --> 00:09:30,076
"go clean yourself quickly
inside the bathroom, go!!"

68
00:09:48,968 --> 00:09:51,596
See who in inside.

69
00:09:56,643 --> 00:10:00,670
What are you doing? He is
washing blood from his hands.

70
00:10:12,759 --> 00:10:16,024
"Namdev, what are you doing
here? - It is the police!"

71
00:10:16,095 --> 00:10:24,366
Come inside. Why is the
police chasing you?

72
00:10:24,437 --> 00:10:29,431
Jagdish has been murdered.
But i haven't murdered him<i>...</i>

73
00:10:29,509 --> 00:10:36,073
"ask raghu, he too was present
there<i>. - </i> where is raghu?"

74
00:10:36,149 --> 00:10:39,641
I don't know. Maybe he too has
run away on seeing the police.

75
00:10:39,719 --> 00:10:43,655
"Don't worry, i am with you."

76
00:10:49,128 --> 00:10:54,225
"Damu, what has happened
to you?"

77
00:12:01,134 --> 00:12:03,602
They are all dead.

78
00:12:21,621 --> 00:12:25,148
"Can you tell me,
where is namdev."

79
00:12:25,224 --> 00:12:32,392
"Namdev did not come, his wife
and 2 kids had come<i>...</i>"

80
00:12:32,465 --> 00:12:35,957
look what has happened!

81
00:12:36,035 --> 00:12:40,028
We are looking for him. He has
murdered and run away.

82
00:12:40,106 --> 00:12:45,100
"No, namdev cannot do this<i>. - </i>
we will find him."

83
00:12:45,178 --> 00:13:01,084
"It cannot be, namdev cannot do
it. God have mercy on us."

84
00:13:04,464 --> 00:13:08,924
"Here is lottery money, 5 lakhs
what'll you do with the money?"

85
00:13:09,001 --> 00:13:17,204
I will make a hotel<i>. - </i> i was
also thinking the same<i>...</i>

86
00:13:17,276 --> 00:13:25,479
let us make the hotel together.
Namdev will also get peace!

87
00:13:27,954 --> 00:13:33,119
Ok. We will give his son a job
as a barman in the hotel.

88
00:13:39,132 --> 00:13:43,967
Did you get hurt? - No. Now i'm
used to slipping on your marbles

89
00:13:44,036 --> 00:13:49,668
"even her headmaster slipped on
the marbles, she keeps."

90
00:13:49,742 --> 00:13:56,978
"You will never improve. Auntie,
where is johnny? - There he iis"

91
00:14:04,223 --> 00:14:10,321
johnny what is this. You've
become a waiter & left studies?

92
00:14:11,697 --> 00:14:14,666
"This is our family profession.
Grandpa in vithal hotel, father <i>...</i>"

93
00:14:14,734 --> 00:14:20,570
"...in irani hotel, and me in this
ram bharose hotel. Come & sit!"

94
00:14:23,242 --> 00:14:30,171
You know dad is sending me to
england. But i told them i am...

95
00:14:30,249 --> 00:14:35,346
...not leaving johnny<i>. - </i> study
& become a big man.

96
00:14:35,421 --> 00:14:38,618
"When you become big man, i
will feel very happy!"

97
00:14:45,064 --> 00:14:47,259
I had two drinks in name of
jagdish and namdev.

98
00:14:47,333 --> 00:14:50,359
"May god bless their souls!
- You drink to your friends..."

99
00:14:50,436 --> 00:14:54,270
...& we will drink to the
future of this hotel.

100
00:14:54,340 --> 00:14:58,401
You are drinking! - Father has
said you must follow in the...

101
00:14:58,477 --> 00:15:00,945
"...foot steps of your elders.
What do you say, dad?"

102
00:15:01,013 --> 00:15:06,383
Of course son. Live on! You
also teach your son to drink.

103
00:15:06,452 --> 00:15:12,618
"Come on, fill it up."

104
00:15:14,927 --> 00:15:17,327
Congratulations on completion of
20 years of the hotel.

105
00:15:17,396 --> 00:15:20,456
I will congratulate after today's
function becomes a success.

106
00:15:20,533 --> 00:15:25,163
Today lots of big people
including film stars are coming.

107
00:15:25,238 --> 00:15:32,542
There should be no complaints.
- We are no less than them.

108
00:15:32,612 --> 00:15:35,740
See our arrangements
tonight!

109
00:15:44,724 --> 00:15:46,988
"Arrangements are super today,
but where is your waiter..."

110
00:15:47,093 --> 00:15:50,358
...with three names who
entertains us all here!

111
00:15:50,429 --> 00:15:54,729
There he is!

112
00:15:54,967 --> 00:16:07,311
"John jhonny janardhan,
here he comes."

113
00:16:07,380 --> 00:16:12,147
"You call, and there i come."

114
00:16:12,218 --> 00:16:54,554
"A friend of friends, and
an enemy of enemies!"

115
00:17:26,258 --> 00:17:29,022
How has he got three names?

116
00:17:31,397 --> 00:17:45,573
"The 3 names are all mine.
Allah, jesus and ram are mine."

117
00:17:48,647 --> 00:17:57,282
So call me by any name! I am
a friend of friends<i>...</i>

118
00:17:57,356 --> 00:18:02,589
...an enemy of enemies!

119
00:18:57,349 --> 00:19:41,654
"These film stars, they entertain
everybody, & i entertain them."

120
00:20:59,705 --> 00:21:19,547
"Whether they are english or
indian, i have seen all films."

121
00:21:19,625 --> 00:21:52,791
I too wanted to become a hero.
But fate landed me in a hotel.

122
00:22:41,507 --> 00:22:46,672
"Johny, here is your mawa cake.
With great difficulty i got it."

123
00:22:52,518 --> 00:22:57,478
I will send it for vicky with the
pilot. Go from there.

124
00:23:11,670 --> 00:23:14,639
I hope you are not hurt.

125
00:23:14,707 --> 00:23:19,007
"I told you, no one plays
marbles at this age."

126
00:23:43,235 --> 00:23:46,136
Look i didn't drop the
marbles deliberately.

127
00:24:05,023 --> 00:24:08,083
"No, please go.
I will help myself."

128
00:24:23,942 --> 00:24:28,208
Come off my marbles!

129
00:24:38,190 --> 00:24:40,055
What is happening?

130
00:24:44,363 --> 00:24:48,163
This is what is happening!

131
00:25:06,685 --> 00:25:11,679
A small trouble for you. My
friend vicky is there in uk.

132
00:25:11,924 --> 00:25:17,294
Please give it to him<i>. - </i> that's
all? If you want we will take u.

133
00:25:17,362 --> 00:25:21,355
"I am not that fortunate. When
this cake reaches, i'll think..."

134
00:25:21,433 --> 00:25:28,430
...i too have reached.
Here's the address.

135
00:26:01,974 --> 00:26:05,637
How can you take so much of
casino winnings. You will have...

136
00:26:05,711 --> 00:26:13,174
"...to play more, vicky. Give
others also a chance."

137
00:26:22,127 --> 00:26:26,120
Your friend johnny has sent
this cake for you.

138
00:26:28,500 --> 00:26:36,032
"My god, i had forgotten my
birthday, by not johnny."

139
00:26:36,108 --> 00:26:41,171
"Captain, this is called friendship,
love and affection<i>...</i>"

140
00:26:41,246 --> 00:26:46,513
he will send me a cake
wherever i am.

141
00:27:08,140 --> 00:27:12,133
We have a saying that if you
sweeten your mouth in the<i>...</i>

142
00:27:12,210 --> 00:27:16,044
"...morning, the whole day passes
off well. So have a piece!"

143
00:28:48,340 --> 00:28:54,939
"We present this
to you, miss asha."

144
00:29:06,925 --> 00:29:09,951
It seems you have a sore throat.
Should i cancel the programme.

145
00:29:10,028 --> 00:29:15,432
"No, whenever my voice goes bad,
i use cokila drops."

146
00:29:28,914 --> 00:29:39,620
Are you in my fate?
Am i in your fate...

147
00:29:39,691 --> 00:29:54,038
only he knows as he has
written everybody's fate.

148
00:29:56,541 --> 00:29:59,442
"Now put on this bikini, we
have to take a last shot."

149
00:29:59,511 --> 00:30:03,140
"You will look beautiful, and
audience will appreciate."

150
00:30:03,215 --> 00:30:05,513
Do you think i will put on these
clothes? Are u out of your mind.

151
00:30:05,584 --> 00:30:09,645
You promised you will advertise
all our products.

152
00:30:09,721 --> 00:30:15,523
"But not this bikini, which in no
way is our national pride."

153
00:30:15,594 --> 00:30:19,496
"If you don't, we will ensure that
you put on these clothes."

154
00:30:19,564 --> 00:30:23,159
I too will see who will compel
me to put on these clothes.

155
00:30:23,235 --> 00:30:27,137
"You clown, just because you left
india, does it mean that <i>...</i>"

156
00:30:27,205 --> 00:30:30,231
...you stop respecting indians!
- Who are you?

157
00:30:30,308 --> 00:30:35,268
"An indian. And you should
know, in india, women <i>...</i>"

158
00:30:35,347 --> 00:30:41,479
...iook beautiful not by removing
clothes but by putting them on.

159
00:30:41,553 --> 00:30:45,284
We are doing publicity
for this bikini.

160
00:30:45,357 --> 00:30:50,056
Why don't you put it on? We'll
have publicity as well as fun.

161
00:30:55,066 --> 00:31:02,734
"Save me, call the police."

162
00:31:02,974 --> 00:31:07,741
"Come on monkey, take your
clothes from the tree."

163
00:31:15,520 --> 00:31:18,683
"You have become a hero in front
of her, one day i will make you<i>...</i>"

164
00:31:18,757 --> 00:31:28,962
...a villain. I too will dishonor
you. I will show you.

165
00:31:29,034 --> 00:31:35,269
Thank you. One must look after
his country men in foreign land.

166
00:31:36,608 --> 00:31:41,204
And bad times can come to me
also. I am vicky.

167
00:31:41,279 --> 00:31:51,348
"And i am asha<i>. - </i> yes, there is
hope and you are india's pride."

168
00:31:51,423 --> 00:31:58,727
"What do you do here? - I do
farming, i study in college of..."

169
00:31:58,797 --> 00:32:03,461
...agriculture. What are you
doing this evening?

170
00:32:03,535 --> 00:32:08,234
I have my show today.
- And tomorrow.?

171
00:32:08,306 --> 00:32:12,743
"It is my last day, so i am
going for sight seeing."

172
00:32:12,978 --> 00:32:15,412
May i accompany you
as your guide?

173
00:32:15,480 --> 00:32:20,076
Some other time. Bye.

174
00:32:20,151 --> 00:32:26,522
"May be it is not in fate, that i
spend an evening with you."

175
00:34:30,348 --> 00:34:37,049
How will i repay this debt? - I
am a straight forward man.

176
00:34:37,122 --> 00:34:41,354
Many girls have extended their
hand towards me but i declined.

177
00:34:41,426 --> 00:34:45,419
You are the first woman i am
extending my hand to<i>...</i>

178
00:34:45,497 --> 00:34:48,227
say yes or no.

179
00:34:48,299 --> 00:34:53,430
"Look mr. Vicky, we have hardly
met. We are not even friends."

180
00:34:53,505 --> 00:34:57,498
The question of marriage
does not arise.

181
00:35:12,056 --> 00:35:17,392
"Were you doing all this, to
prove to me that he is a hero?"

182
00:35:23,201 --> 00:35:28,161
So you did all this to
impress me?

183
00:35:28,239 --> 00:35:31,675
"All this is a lie, i don't
even know them."

184
00:35:31,743 --> 00:35:35,577
But i know you now<i>. - </i> this
chap is lying!

185
00:35:35,647 --> 00:35:39,549
Please get off the boat.

186
00:36:01,539 --> 00:36:04,940
Go and enjoy yourself now!

187
00:36:07,912 --> 00:36:12,144
You spoiled my tv program
and we spoiled your romance!

188
00:36:12,217 --> 00:36:19,555
"Yes, that was my move.
You dropped me in the water."

189
00:36:43,548 --> 00:36:49,145
"Sir, please increase my pay<i>. - </i>
why, i increased your pay by..."

190
00:36:49,220 --> 00:36:55,181
...rs. 10 five years back<i>. - </i> my
brother is in simla for studies.

191
00:36:55,260 --> 00:37:00,425
Why do you waste your money.
Make him a waiter also.

192
00:37:00,498 --> 00:37:04,958
"No, he will not become a waiter.
He will become so big, that..."

193
00:37:05,036 --> 00:37:09,132
...people will have to look up
to talk to him.

194
00:37:12,277 --> 00:37:22,551
Just increase by one mark
and let me pass.

195
00:37:22,620 --> 00:37:25,646
Catch him and bring him down.
- He has latched the top...

196
00:37:25,723 --> 00:37:29,022
...door from inside.

197
00:37:32,997 --> 00:37:36,023
"If you increase one mark, i will
come down by the stairs. Else..."

198
00:37:36,100 --> 00:37:42,471
...i will jump and come down<i>. - </i>
think! For one mark he will die.

199
00:37:42,540 --> 00:37:50,003
"If i die, police will come, school
will be disgraced. Then nobody..."

200
00:37:50,081 --> 00:38:06,487
...will send students here. School
will get locked. And if <i>...</i>

201
00:38:06,564 --> 00:38:15,905
wait! I am warning you<i>. - </i> i
am also warning you.

202
00:38:15,974 --> 00:38:24,575
Give him that 1 mark. I have 01
marks. Give him 1 & me 0!

203
00:38:27,919 --> 00:38:35,724
See friends he has ignored moti's
appeal. Now i'll count to 3 & <i>...</i>

204
00:38:35,960 --> 00:38:40,624
...then i will dive on you!

205
00:38:46,270 --> 00:38:50,070
"Look, i will dive, hold
me properly."

206
00:38:52,110 --> 00:39:07,356
"Ok, 1, 2, 21/4. 21/2, 23/4
what a wretch you are."

207
00:39:07,425 --> 00:39:13,125
God didn't take so much time to
make world as you are taking.

208
00:39:13,197 --> 00:39:21,002
"Ok, i'll give you one more
opportunity. I am in no hurry."

209
00:39:24,108 --> 00:39:29,239
"Come on girls, come out
quickly<i>. - </i> girls!"

210
00:39:31,282 --> 00:39:50,658
"Wait, don't go. Don't spoil my
plans. You have<i>...</i>"

211
00:39:50,735 --> 00:39:57,197
"sunny, forget all this. Your girl
is stuck in the hostel fire!"

212
00:40:54,532 --> 00:40:56,693
"Don't you feel ashamed hiding
and smoking, you idiot!"

213
00:40:56,768 --> 00:41:03,367
Fire!<i>. - </i> the whole building is
on fire and you have put on...

214
00:41:03,441 --> 00:41:14,045
"...ear muffs! Something is
wrong with you, you fool"

215
00:41:14,118 --> 00:41:30,194
"you are smoking here, and my
plan has gone hayward!"

216
00:41:37,375 --> 00:41:44,178
"Bring your face here!
Ok, now."

217
00:42:06,370 --> 00:42:12,172
What are you doing? - I'm
taking smoke out of her!

218
00:42:12,243 --> 00:42:17,442
"See, it has come out!"

219
00:42:17,515 --> 00:42:28,392
"Tell her, i have saved her life
by risking my life<i>. - </i> correct."

220
00:42:28,459 --> 00:42:34,227
"If i hadn't come in time, she
would have become a "kabab"."

221
00:42:34,298 --> 00:42:40,567
"You are so brave, may you
live a 1000 years."

222
00:42:40,638 --> 00:42:44,734
"If one mark is increased, it is
better to live 1 year with..."

223
00:42:44,976 --> 00:42:47,444
...respect than live a 1000
years! - Correct!

224
00:42:47,511 --> 00:42:51,174
It is better to drown in a cup of
water than to face elder brother!

225
00:42:51,249 --> 00:42:52,375
Correct!

226
00:42:52,450 --> 00:42:55,977
It is better to increase one mark
and pass than this! - Correct.

227
00:42:56,053 --> 00:42:58,647
If it is all correct then can't
supreme court appeal to the...

228
00:42:58,723 --> 00:43:01,317
...high court to increase
that one mark.

229
00:43:01,392 --> 00:43:08,491
Supreme court will order the
high court. Pass this deserving...

230
00:43:08,566 --> 00:43:11,034
...boy immediately<i>. - </i>
but listen to me.

231
00:43:13,537 --> 00:43:16,563
"No, when i say it, pass him.
- Ok, pass!"

232
00:43:23,981 --> 00:43:32,116
"Madam, please allow us to play
kabaddi match with the girls."

233
00:43:32,189 --> 00:43:42,429
"Wait, between boys and girls?
No, it is not possible. No."

234
00:43:50,708 --> 00:43:54,144
Don't get annoyed reading
my love letter.

235
00:43:54,211 --> 00:43:59,205
Till when will this moon torment
one in love with you.

236
00:43:59,283 --> 00:44:08,487
The weather is so beautiful.

237
00:44:08,559 --> 00:44:13,121
"It is spring all over, but<i>...</i>"

238
00:44:13,197 --> 00:44:23,732
"then why shouldn't we meet, do
you agree? - I've no objection."

239
00:44:23,975 --> 00:44:28,002
Then at 7:30 should we meet
at milan cinema?

240
00:44:35,186 --> 00:44:39,020
"Meeting will be there, but before
that come with sunny and me."

241
00:44:46,197 --> 00:44:53,729
This youth is so romantic.
I am coming.

242
00:44:53,971 --> 00:44:59,967
What are you doing here?
- Keeping guard! What a good...

243
00:45:00,011 --> 00:45:09,511
"...suit, & your hair so black.
Where is the lightning falling!"

244
00:45:09,587 --> 00:45:13,284
Who are you to ask? Cigarette!
Throw it away. You know...

245
00:45:13,357 --> 00:45:16,019
...going out after 4 is
not allowed.

246
00:45:16,093 --> 00:45:21,656
This rule is applicable to us
as well as you.

247
00:45:21,732 --> 00:45:34,202
I am just checking<i>. - </i> checking
that all are decked up!

248
00:45:34,278 --> 00:45:41,446
"Singing song, with perfume and
hair blackened. Are you trying..."

249
00:45:41,519 --> 00:45:46,183
...to win madam? You are
being very naughty.

250
00:45:46,257 --> 00:45:48,748
"Speak slowly, somebody
will listen."

251
00:45:48,993 --> 00:45:57,526
"Then give us permission to play
kabaddi, or else, all will know!"

252
00:45:57,601 --> 00:46:03,267
You are my son. You will not
expose me. You want permission?

253
00:46:03,340 --> 00:46:06,207
It is given! - 
i too have given.

254
00:46:38,342 --> 00:47:24,080
"Catch & see they don't escape. If
they do, see that they dont return."

255
00:47:43,007 --> 00:48:04,192
"Catch her leg, make her lame.
Hold her arm, then twist it."

256
00:48:04,261 --> 00:48:13,260
"She is your enemy,
not your lover."

257
00:49:20,638 --> 00:49:45,020
"See girls, don't let him escape.
He has to be caught!"

258
00:49:45,095 --> 00:50:04,971
"Catch and don't let them escape.
If they do, let them not return!"

259
00:50:34,345 --> 00:50:54,221
"Look at this one. Come,
handle her carefully."

260
00:50:54,298 --> 00:51:06,403
Be careful her slim waist
doesn't get a sprain.

261
00:51:43,180 --> 00:51:50,450
Catch & don't let them escape!

262
00:51:50,521 --> 00:51:53,979
I will not leave anyone!

263
00:52:10,307 --> 00:52:14,744
"What mischief is all this? - 
simple! It means, sweety will..."

264
00:52:14,978 --> 00:52:23,283
...be singing in our hotel from
now-who are you to stop me?

265
00:52:23,353 --> 00:52:28,552
The proprietor's son! - Father
folds his hands for me to work<i>...</i>

266
00:52:28,625 --> 00:52:42,471
"...and the son breaks them! - But
for u, i've something else, acid!"

267
00:53:39,463 --> 00:53:45,265
The bird is caught in the net!
- Leave my hand. Leave me.

268
00:54:04,421 --> 00:54:09,381
5 males & one woman. If
somebody sees they'll spit at u.

269
00:54:09,459 --> 00:54:12,656
"Just put on these bangles, it
will be a balanced match."

270
00:54:12,729 --> 00:54:18,133
First put on these bangles.

271
00:54:23,040 --> 00:54:26,339
"I said, put on these bangles,
and don't move your hands."

272
00:54:33,083 --> 00:54:35,711
Where are you going?
Won't you sing?

273
00:55:57,134 --> 00:55:59,295
Now all four of you
sing a chorus.

274
00:56:01,204 --> 00:56:04,605
Thank you very much.
This i knew.

275
00:56:04,675 --> 00:56:14,050
You will thank me & i'll say
it was my duty. You will ask...

276
00:56:14,117 --> 00:56:19,316
...my name & i'll say that i'm
john jani janardhan. You'll ask...

277
00:56:19,389 --> 00:56:36,228
my address & i'll say i stay in a
5 star hotel. Then you'll ask...

278
00:56:36,306 --> 00:56:40,436
but you<i>... - </i>
please let me speak.

279
00:56:40,510 --> 00:56:47,040
In all pictures it happens like
this. Villain troubles the heroine...

280
00:56:47,117 --> 00:56:54,216
...with his goons. Hero comes &
beats the villian. Then hero &...

281
00:56:54,291 --> 00:57:03,632
"...heroine become friends, then
marriage, then<i>... - </i> nonsense."

282
00:57:03,700 --> 00:57:10,401
Nothing like this will happen
here. I am going. Bye.

283
00:57:17,481 --> 00:57:19,506
Will you open this shutter?

284
00:57:22,385 --> 00:57:30,349
"I hope, you had not hired these
goons to prove, u are a hero?"

285
00:57:30,427 --> 00:57:38,926
"What is your name? Anyway, if
it was a film, it could be! This..."

286
00:57:39,002 --> 00:57:47,637
...is reality. If i hadn't come you
would have by this time<i>...</i> bye.

287
00:58:01,487 --> 00:58:14,525
"We present to you, india's
famous singer, miss asha."

288
00:58:48,101 --> 00:59:10,151
"Are you in my fate, or not.
Am i in your fate, or not."

289
00:59:10,223 --> 00:59:22,727
Who knows except one who has
written everybody's fate.

290
00:59:59,772 --> 01:00:05,301
"You? - Yes, i had told you i
stay in a 5 star hotel and feed..."

291
01:00:05,378 --> 01:00:10,247
...the hungry. That gentleman
there has invited you for dinner.

292
01:00:10,316 --> 01:00:20,419
One day in my dreams
he met me.

293
01:00:20,493 --> 01:00:40,472
"Looking at me,
he lost his soul."

294
01:00:40,546 --> 01:00:48,476
I got scared...
and i blushed.

295
01:00:51,891 --> 01:01:01,857
When he came close to
me and said...

296
01:01:01,934 --> 01:01:21,014
"are you in my fate, or not.
Am i in your fate, or not."

297
01:01:59,992 --> 01:02:18,241
And then we met again...
on one romantic night.

298
01:02:18,311 --> 01:02:29,188
"We talked the same thing as to
how are we feeling, and i said..."

299
01:02:29,255 --> 01:02:50,838
you only tell me... and
he also said...

300
01:02:50,910 --> 01:03:00,808
"are you in my fate,
or am i in yours..."

301
01:03:00,886 --> 01:03:12,229
...only one who has written
our fate knows.

302
01:03:12,298 --> 01:03:58,400
"Am i in your fate, or not.
Are you in my fate, or not..."

303
01:04:20,766 --> 01:04:23,929
don't call me here by snapping
your fingers like u did in hotel.

304
01:04:24,003 --> 01:04:26,198
Here you will have to call me
with love & respect.

305
01:04:26,272 --> 01:04:31,801
Should i drop you home?
- You will drop me home?

306
01:04:31,877 --> 01:04:36,746
I thought the story ended in the
hotel. It appears something else...

307
01:04:47,126 --> 01:04:50,391
you finished your meal fast.
- I didn't have my meal.

308
01:04:50,463 --> 01:04:53,193
"That's a very good thing, you
did. The food is as bad as the..."

309
01:04:53,265 --> 01:05:00,728
"...villains. If you had eaten,
your sweet voice would've gone."

310
01:05:00,806 --> 01:05:08,679
"I didn't call you to talk crap.
- Ok, i will keep quiet."

311
01:05:11,350 --> 01:05:20,748
Where do you want to go? - You
told me not to speak & why ask

312
01:05:20,826 --> 01:05:24,990
i want to go to ballard pier.
- You stay there?

313
01:05:25,064 --> 01:05:29,967
"No, someone waits there for me.
- Waits? - yes."

314
01:05:30,035 --> 01:05:49,183
"Who? - My lover. We meet for
an hour, some kisses & it's fun"

315
01:05:54,326 --> 01:06:00,060
"you dropped me at the right
place. Come, i will introduce you."

316
01:06:00,132 --> 01:06:05,092
"I don't want to meet your lover.
- Since you've come, meet him!"

317
01:06:05,170 --> 01:06:10,802
"No thanks, bye! - Just listen!"

318
01:06:21,453 --> 01:06:24,388
My fate appears cock-eyed!

319
01:06:34,900 --> 01:06:37,892
My friend has come.

320
01:06:37,970 --> 01:06:43,067
It is my fate that i have to
kiss this guy!

321
01:06:43,142 --> 01:06:46,009
"Yes, that too the face
you have to smash."

322
01:06:46,078 --> 01:06:50,947
Today's fight is not easy.
Just look at the guy?

323
01:06:56,355 --> 01:07:00,689
Look i have sold everything and
brought rs 5000. tell me how...

324
01:07:00,759 --> 01:07:03,023
...much should i put on you<i>. - </i>
as much as you want.

325
01:07:10,769 --> 01:07:15,763
Should i put 1 for 5?
Ok.

326
01:07:20,479 --> 01:07:28,443
Here. I am putting 1 for 5. ok?
1 for 5 done.

327
01:07:31,056 --> 01:07:35,390
I am putting 5000. fight well.

328
01:07:38,731 --> 01:07:45,728
"Mehboob, my mood is gone<i>. - </i>
what! If you lose, i lose rs 5000"

329
01:08:13,265 --> 01:08:18,794
why didn't she come? - Forget
all that and fight.

330
01:08:36,255 --> 01:08:40,385
"Go, my dear fight or else i will
get a heart attack. Go."

331
01:10:20,092 --> 01:10:22,526
"Good you came, i was not
getting in the mood to fight."

332
01:10:24,263 --> 01:10:30,133
"Hey, wait. I am talking to a girl."

333
01:10:30,202 --> 01:10:35,731
"Just wait, i am returning."

334
01:10:46,552 --> 01:10:48,850
"Wait, don't go, ok?"

335
01:12:25,050 --> 01:12:30,044
"Well done johnny,
you fought well."

336
01:12:30,122 --> 01:12:32,920
"It is good you came, otherwise i
was in no mood to fight."

337
01:12:32,991 --> 01:12:40,488
I have to make an extra buck
for my younger brothers fees.

338
01:12:40,732 --> 01:12:43,792
"For your own blood, you have
to shed some blood."

339
01:12:43,869 --> 01:12:56,339
How did you return? - I thought
i will meet your lover<i>. - </i> is it?

340
01:12:56,415 --> 01:13:06,120
"Ok, i will show you<i>. - </i> my hero,
you smashed him. You are great."

341
01:13:06,191 --> 01:13:12,027
Can't you see a girl is standing
here. He is my sweet heart!

342
01:13:12,097 --> 01:13:15,225
So this is your lover?

343
01:13:22,441 --> 01:13:26,878
Why are you laughing? - What a
lover you have found?

344
01:13:26,945 --> 01:13:32,110
"Suppose there was a beautiful
girl like you, then?"

345
01:13:32,184 --> 01:13:36,780
I would have smashed her into
pieces<i>. - </i> look ahead!

346
01:13:36,855 --> 01:13:42,851
There is some burning smell<i>. - </i>
why should i be jealous?

347
01:13:42,928 --> 01:13:49,231
"If you are, tell me. Unless there
is something, one is not jealous."

348
01:13:49,301 --> 01:13:55,968
"Say it, if you are jealous i am
the happiest guy on earth!"

349
01:14:00,045 --> 01:14:03,879
"Ok, it starts today<i>. - </i> what are
you doing, i will hit you."

350
01:14:03,949 --> 01:14:10,047
"Hit me, i am used to it. If you
hit me, i will die happily."

351
01:14:10,122 --> 01:14:12,750
"One day, i have to land
in a coffin."

352
01:15:02,808 --> 01:15:06,710
What will it be worth? - 
atleast 1.5 million.

353
01:15:06,778 --> 01:15:12,876
"No, it is 2 million. And on
reaching the market, 2.5 million."

354
01:15:12,951 --> 01:15:17,888
"Let it get organised, we will
earn in billions, isn't it, damu."

355
01:15:17,956 --> 01:15:27,092
"This is the last. After this, no
opium & poppy will be grown..."

356
01:15:27,165 --> 01:15:29,360
...on my farm<i>. - </i> why? - 
my son is coming back.

357
01:15:29,434 --> 01:15:32,494
"That is the reason, i can't do
business with you."

358
01:15:32,737 --> 01:15:36,764
"Sons should be like mine, who
follow their father. Your son..."

359
01:15:36,842 --> 01:15:42,474
"look, i have said it! I want the
whole place cleared by tomorrow"

360
01:15:49,187 --> 01:15:54,454
"damu, in our business, there is
no father, no mother, brother..."

361
01:15:54,693 --> 01:16:05,001
...only money. Take care of your
son. Or we will take care of him

362
01:16:05,070 --> 01:16:11,031
that will not be necessary. I
will take care of it.

363
01:16:54,452 --> 01:16:56,750
How did this happen?

364
01:16:56,821 --> 01:17:00,757
Whoever threatens my son
will meet this fate

365
01:17:29,921 --> 01:17:34,085
"for a sore throat, take strepsil."

366
01:17:37,929 --> 01:17:41,956
Did it make a difference?

367
01:17:44,970 --> 01:17:49,430
"Your medicine is great, else my
show would have been cancelled."

368
01:17:49,507 --> 01:17:54,137
"Thank you, you may ask what
ever you want for it."

369
01:17:54,212 --> 01:18:00,447
Really! - Yes- then give your
hand into mine!

370
01:18:05,090 --> 01:18:08,025
What do you think of this hand?
- It is very heavy.

371
01:18:11,062 --> 01:18:13,394
"What are you doing, we are
doing shooting for a medicine."

372
01:18:13,465 --> 01:18:20,496
But he held your hand<i>...</i> how
dare he ask for your hand!

373
01:18:22,240 --> 01:18:25,232
Why haven't you asked for my
hand till today?

374
01:18:32,284 --> 01:18:35,151
That is what i have
come here for.

375
01:18:35,220 --> 01:18:37,848
"Listen, i don't have money but a
treasure house in my heart."

376
01:18:37,922 --> 01:18:42,825
"I will make you a queen. I give
food on the table to people..."

377
01:18:42,894 --> 01:18:47,024
"...but i will place you in my
heart, and serve you forever"

378
01:18:49,134 --> 01:18:52,399
"every one is around<i>. - </i> yes, let
them all know. Let me kiss you."

379
01:18:54,706 --> 01:19:03,410
"Yes, yes and yes<i>. - </i> not like
this. Smile and say it."

380
01:19:03,481 --> 01:19:06,109
Come tomorrow and meet mother.

381
01:19:14,059 --> 01:19:22,057
"I forgot, my friend is coming
from london. Drop me on your..."

382
01:19:22,133 --> 01:19:28,436
...motor cycle- let me change!

383
01:19:32,911 --> 01:19:35,038
Father.

384
01:19:43,121 --> 01:19:44,986
This smell of liqour?

385
01:19:45,056 --> 01:19:51,222
I drink sometimes when i am
unhappy but abroad it is normal.

386
01:19:53,031 --> 01:19:57,934
My friend johnny hasn't come.

387
01:20:02,707 --> 01:20:13,311
"Take out your license<i>. - </i> license?
- Let us go, we are late."

388
01:20:14,886 --> 01:20:18,481
"John, you go. I will park the
bike and come."

389
01:20:21,126 --> 01:20:25,324
"Father, john should be coming."

390
01:20:34,873 --> 01:20:44,942
"John, i thought you will never
come<i>. - </i> how is that possible!"

391
01:20:45,016 --> 01:20:49,953
"To celebrate our meeting, let
me have a drink."

392
01:20:53,258 --> 01:20:55,818
You have started drinking?

393
01:20:55,894 --> 01:21:01,924
You have made liquor a monster.
I am taking liquor not poison.

394
01:21:02,000 --> 01:21:09,873
"Son, i am getting late<i>. - </i> wait
father. What do you know..."

395
01:21:09,941 --> 01:21:24,880
"...about friendship! - Vicky, you
are still the same. Its good."

396
01:21:24,956 --> 01:21:31,122
Tonight there is a party at my
place and you are coming<i>. - </i> but<i>...</i>

397
01:21:31,196 --> 01:21:38,227
"if you talk like this, then
tonight's party is cancelled, and..."

398
01:21:38,303 --> 01:21:42,205
"...i will smash everything to
pieces - ok, i'll come."

399
01:21:42,273 --> 01:21:52,046
But i have a girl friend<i>. - </i> bring
her along. Let's see your choice!

400
01:21:52,116 --> 01:21:57,247
"If you had seen her before, you
would have chosen her."

401
01:21:59,157 --> 01:22:06,928
"Enough, vicky. Let us go<i>. - </i> ok.
Just a second. How is julie?"

402
01:22:08,266 --> 01:22:21,976
"She has grown, & she is
beautiful<i>. - </i> ok, see you."

403
01:22:28,186 --> 01:22:34,955
You met your friend? - There he
goes. He has called you at his...

404
01:22:35,026 --> 01:22:38,928
...party tonight<i>. - </i> how can i
come. I have a show.

405
01:22:38,997 --> 01:22:43,798
"Cancel it, my friend has come.
- Not possible."

406
01:22:43,868 --> 01:22:46,234
"I have an agreement of 1 year,
and can't cancel any show."

407
01:22:46,304 --> 01:22:51,867
You honor your contract and i
will honor my friendship.

408
01:22:54,312 --> 01:22:56,337
"Julie, come down fast."

409
01:22:56,414 --> 01:23:02,785
"If for engagement, it is taking so
much time what will happen..."

410
01:23:02,854 --> 01:23:06,950
"...at the time of marriage?
Perhaps, a life time?"

411
01:23:07,025 --> 01:23:09,755
"She is a girl, and girls
take time to dress up."

412
01:23:09,827 --> 01:23:15,424
"My friend has come from london,
and he looks so smart!"

413
01:23:15,500 --> 01:23:21,166
"Ok, but get julie. Rodrigues
is waiting last two hours."

414
01:23:21,239 --> 01:23:29,704
It is a question of marriage. She
must be feeling shy. I'll get her.

415
01:23:34,352 --> 01:23:41,281
"Rodrigues, you know this? - 
what is this? - Marbles!"

416
01:23:41,359 --> 01:23:45,887
"Yes, i played in childhood<i>. - </i>
good, you will have to play..."

417
01:23:45,964 --> 01:23:48,296
...even after marriage!

418
01:23:52,737 --> 01:23:55,900
"You are here. Come, there is a
boy to meet you. Come."

419
01:23:58,142 --> 01:24:01,703
You are crying? - I don't
want to marry him.

420
01:24:01,779 --> 01:24:04,043
Don't marry him.
But why do you cry?

421
01:24:04,115 --> 01:24:17,825
"Do you love somebody else?
- Yes, our friend vicky."

422
01:24:19,864 --> 01:24:23,960
When did you start loving him?
- Since i was small.

423
01:24:26,004 --> 01:24:28,199
"You are telling now! If you had
told me earlier, i would have..."

424
01:24:28,272 --> 01:24:30,706
...got you married to him and
sent you to london.

425
01:24:30,775 --> 01:24:36,179
"Now i understand, why my friend
keeps asking about you. How is..."

426
01:24:36,247 --> 01:24:43,210
"...she, does she look beautiful?
Will she come to my party?"

427
01:24:43,287 --> 01:24:48,384
"He has called me to a party? - 
yes, and i will talk to him..."

428
01:24:48,459 --> 01:24:53,362
...about your wedding also.
- Truly? - yes!

429
01:25:24,762 --> 01:25:29,131
"Mr damodar, he can get cirrosis
of the liver. If he doesn't stop..."

430
01:25:29,200 --> 01:25:34,502
"...drinking, results can be
very damaging."

431
01:25:34,739 --> 01:25:37,207
Have you heard what
the doctor said?

432
01:25:37,275 --> 01:25:45,205
"Doctors say anything. Life brings
birth and death, then how does<i>...</i>"

433
01:25:45,283 --> 01:25:49,344
...liquor come in between? - So
you will not give up drinking!

434
01:25:49,420 --> 01:26:00,957
"No, unless... no<i>. - </i> ok, drink as
much as you want."

435
01:26:01,032 --> 01:26:05,196
"Till you give up drinking, i will
not return to this house."

436
01:26:08,473 --> 01:26:20,249
How is he?

437
01:26:20,318 --> 01:26:24,345
"At present he is ok, but if
he carries on like this, the..."

438
01:26:24,422 --> 01:26:31,225
...end won't be good. He is your
friend. Try to convince him.

439
01:26:37,068 --> 01:26:39,093
"Julie, you stay here."

440
01:26:51,716 --> 01:26:57,120
"If you have come to lecture
me, then just shut up."

441
01:26:57,188 --> 01:27:01,181
"No, i have come to reason with
you. What is it that is troubling<i>...</i>"

442
01:27:01,259 --> 01:27:25,209
...you that you drink so much<i>. - </i>
love! It makes you cry or drink.

443
01:27:25,283 --> 01:27:36,922
In london i met a girl. You also
have a look at her.

444
01:27:36,994 --> 01:27:53,036
"If you had met her before me,
you would have chosen her."

445
01:28:01,452 --> 01:28:06,253
"If she returns to your life, will
you give up drinking?"

446
01:28:06,324 --> 01:28:10,727
"Why give up drinking, i will
give up my life."

447
01:28:10,795 --> 01:28:14,128
"No friend, just give up
drinking liquor."

448
01:28:14,198 --> 01:28:17,759
"If required, i will give
up my life."

449
01:28:17,835 --> 01:28:22,397
"Forget it, this girl is not going
to return to my life."

450
01:28:22,473 --> 01:28:28,742
And if she returns? - Then i
will give u whatever you ask for

451
01:28:28,813 --> 01:28:35,844
"before time, and after fate,
if there is anything..."

452
01:28:35,920 --> 01:28:39,185
"...left, you may give it to me."

453
01:28:46,063 --> 01:28:55,495
"Is that julie? My god, how much
has she grown. Why don't you...!"

454
01:28:55,740 --> 01:29:00,939
"...come inside? - No, it is better
for me to stay outside now."

455
01:29:01,012 --> 01:29:09,112
For so long i am asking where
is julie. And you are crying!

456
01:29:09,186 --> 01:29:16,251
"Don't worry, i am alright.
Doctors talk nonsense. I will..."

457
01:29:16,327 --> 01:29:22,493
...be alright. First i will find a
good boy for you.

458
01:29:22,733 --> 01:29:25,725
"Then with great pomp and show,
we will get you married."

459
01:30:19,724 --> 01:30:42,001
Life takes tests.
It takes people's lives.

460
01:30:42,079 --> 01:31:05,027
"Life takes tests,
it takes loved one's lives."

461
01:31:05,102 --> 01:31:27,118
"Friendship takes tests,
it takes friends' lives."

462
01:31:27,191 --> 01:31:42,039
Life takes tests.

463
01:32:07,865 --> 01:32:31,451
"Who will inform the uninformed,
that this love will make me mad."

464
01:32:31,522 --> 01:33:03,152
Life takes tests.
It takes lover's lives.

465
01:33:21,071 --> 01:33:23,904
What happened? - 
the same old pain.

466
01:33:23,974 --> 01:33:46,388
Walk carefully in the path of
love. Think and then love.

467
01:33:46,463 --> 01:34:07,910
"Love takes tests,
it takes lovers' lives."

468
01:34:07,985 --> 01:34:18,361
Friendship takes tests.

469
01:34:37,381 --> 01:35:02,696
"Our fate is bad, this i came
to learn from liquor."

470
01:35:02,773 --> 01:35:25,995
"Drinking takes tests,
it takes the drinkers' lives."

471
01:35:26,063 --> 01:35:34,971
Life takes tests.

472
01:35:46,083 --> 01:35:51,248
What has happened to her? - 
maybe she is facing a test.

473
01:36:09,973 --> 01:36:14,342
"John is only coming for a meal,
you cry as if he is marrying!"

474
01:36:14,411 --> 01:36:18,973
"I am not crying, i am
just cutting onions!"

475
01:36:19,049 --> 01:36:25,318
Cooking is beyond you. You
should only sing. What a boy<i>...</i>

476
01:36:25,389 --> 01:36:31,055
"...you have chosen. What a
pair, you will make."

477
01:36:37,167 --> 01:36:40,762
"Just go and see, maybe he has
come<i>. - </i> straight away!"

478
01:36:44,375 --> 01:36:48,471
A letter has only come and the
fiancee hasn't come.

479
01:37:02,426 --> 01:37:09,025
"Did you call me? - Yes, come
in and see."

480
01:37:09,099 --> 01:37:15,231
What is there in her which i
don't have? Kill me but i will...

481
01:37:15,305 --> 01:37:35,216
...not let you go. You wed me
and now you want to go out?

482
01:37:35,292 --> 01:37:42,095
"Yes, i don't want a bore like
you. Don't interfere."

483
01:37:42,166 --> 01:37:47,297
"You will destroy asha like you
destroyed me, is it?"

484
01:37:47,371 --> 01:37:55,710
She is interested in me and i in
her money! Now i will go.

485
01:37:58,215 --> 01:38:01,707
"You have got your money, now
your game is over<i>. - </i> asha..."

486
01:38:01,785 --> 01:38:07,883
i have heard everything. Leave
my hand<i>. - </i> that woman is mad.

487
01:38:07,958 --> 01:38:12,520
"A new girl has come, so i am
mad. You have ruined me."

488
01:38:12,763 --> 01:38:15,732
"I will jump into a well
and take my life<i>. - </i> go, go."

489
01:38:15,799 --> 01:38:20,532
"Stop her, she is going! - Let
her go and die."

490
01:38:25,275 --> 01:38:33,182
"Julie, are you out of your mind?
- Let me die. I want to die!"

491
01:38:40,257 --> 01:38:44,284
You here? - You?

492
01:38:44,361 --> 01:38:53,702
I came to meet johnny<i>. - </i> do
you know john?

493
01:38:53,770 --> 01:39:04,339
Yes i know now. People put
on different masks.

494
01:39:08,452 --> 01:39:14,049
"Vicky, what are you doing here?
- That is what i am asking you."

495
01:39:14,124 --> 01:39:22,395
"Julie is jumping in a well,
and she..."

496
01:39:22,466 --> 01:39:26,732
all this is just latching on to
people. Promises made in past...

497
01:39:26,803 --> 01:39:29,897
...are not to be taken so
seriously. Tell what promises.

498
01:39:29,973 --> 01:39:39,871
"Ok, i got engaged. It is not
necessary, i have to marry you!"

499
01:39:39,950 --> 01:39:47,254
You have to marry. This is not
england where everything goes.

500
01:39:47,324 --> 01:39:51,420
In which law book is this
written?

501
01:39:53,931 --> 01:40:02,066
"You loved julie, got engaged to
her and you never told me?"

502
01:40:02,139 --> 01:40:08,237
"What is there to tell, i have
done so fifty times."

503
01:40:08,312 --> 01:40:14,046
This is no ordinary affair. Her
mother brought you up and fed...

504
01:40:14,117 --> 01:40:29,363
"...you and you talk like that? - 
ok, i will pay her off!"

505
01:40:29,433 --> 01:40:35,895
"How dare you talk like that. You
don't understand love, friendship?"

506
01:40:35,973 --> 01:40:42,742
"From the time i was born, i've
seen all this nonsense."

507
01:40:42,813 --> 01:40:49,514
"World is selfish. When you want
something, you talk of love..."

508
01:40:49,753 --> 01:40:59,788
"...devotion, and friendship. All
is forgotten thereafter."

509
01:41:02,899 --> 01:41:09,361
That means our friendship also...
- go your way. That's best.

510
01:41:09,439 --> 01:41:18,006
Tell me. What is the value of
our friendship? Tell me.

511
01:41:20,317 --> 01:41:31,717
"I love asha so that she will
earn, and i will live in peace."

512
01:41:31,795 --> 01:41:36,459
Now she has come to know of
me. Doesn't matter. There are...

513
01:41:36,533 --> 01:41:39,934
...plenty of fish in the ocean. I
made friends with you as you...

514
01:41:40,003 --> 01:41:49,810
"...are rich. Thought i will take
lots from you, your house..."

515
01:41:58,388 --> 01:42:05,089
"cheat! All my life, i considered
you as my brother."

516
01:42:05,162 --> 01:42:12,330
You are unfit to be even my
enemy. Go and get lost

517
01:42:24,314 --> 01:42:29,980
you are coming with me?

518
01:42:30,053 --> 01:42:58,713
Walk carefully in the lanes of
love. First think and then love.

519
01:42:58,782 --> 01:43:32,847
Love takes tests<i>...</i>it takes lovers
lives. Friendship takes tests.

520
01:43:56,973 --> 01:44:01,910
Seeing your sacrifice even
god is crying.

521
01:44:08,218 --> 01:44:14,680
"In this storm of love, my
friend's life is more precious"

522
01:44:24,067 --> 01:44:30,802
"asha, i hope you don't think that
all was due to me. Or did i <i>...</i>"

523
01:44:30,874 --> 01:44:37,905
...set it all up? He is my
childhood friend. Today he was...

524
01:44:37,981 --> 01:44:42,315
...talking such trash. He broke
so many people's hearts.

525
01:44:42,385 --> 01:44:48,756
In love and friendship one
is often fooled.

526
01:44:48,825 --> 01:44:57,028
"One doesn't know whom to love
and befriend, & whom to trust."

527
01:44:57,100 --> 01:45:06,702
Just halt here<i>. - </i> thank you.

528
01:45:10,680 --> 01:45:17,984
"You are a good man, and a
bottle looks bad in your hands."

529
01:45:58,895 --> 01:46:11,740
You think there is nobody besides
you for johnny. No. Johnny has...

530
01:46:11,808 --> 01:46:21,774
"...now a heart of stone, & it will
not break easily. Like you many <i>...</i>"

531
01:46:21,851 --> 01:46:41,693
...will come and go. Even foreign
ones. I am asking finally!

532
01:47:04,160 --> 01:47:09,723
"Look, here i come."

533
01:47:23,413 --> 01:47:30,410
How much will you drink? - 
how will i live if i don't.

534
01:47:30,487 --> 01:47:41,159
Give me the bottle! - No i will
not<i>. - </i> give. It is my medicine.

535
01:47:41,231 --> 01:47:46,294
"Taking this, one doesn't get hurt."

536
01:49:11,020 --> 01:49:14,478
Where are you going?
- That is my brother.

537
01:49:53,196 --> 01:49:59,931
"Get a proper boxer, where have
you got this school boy from?"

538
01:50:00,003 --> 01:50:07,375
"If i don't beat you up, i am not
my father's son. Raise stakes!"

539
01:50:07,443 --> 01:50:11,379
I hope you don't land me into
trouble<i>. - </i> raise stakes 1 to 10!

540
01:51:07,036 --> 01:51:13,100
"Sonny, what are you doing
inside, come out!"

541
01:51:13,176 --> 01:51:23,450
"Don't touch my brother! - 
brother, i will sort him out!"

542
01:52:27,183 --> 01:52:30,175
Get up!

543
01:52:37,160 --> 01:52:40,357
When did you come? - 
some time back. Aunty told me...

544
01:52:40,430 --> 01:52:48,838
have you passed? Yes. I have<i>. - </i>
let us celebrate. Give the bottle.

545
01:52:48,905 --> 01:52:56,141
"No, let us go home straight<i>. - </i>
no let us celebrate."

546
01:52:56,212 --> 01:53:10,024
What has happened? You are
drinking so much. Don't drink so<i>...</i>

547
01:53:10,093 --> 01:53:16,191
"don't lecture me<i>. - </i> no, i am just
making you understand."

548
01:53:16,265 --> 01:53:19,723
Don't disgrace yourself in front
of these people.

549
01:53:19,802 --> 01:53:29,040
You are abusing me! Who are
you to make me understand?

550
01:53:29,250 --> 01:53:43,688
You are insulting me. I am not
coming with you.

551
01:54:09,356 --> 01:54:13,315
Come my brother!

552
01:54:13,394 --> 01:54:29,573
"Come my brother, i request you,
please come."

553
01:54:29,643 --> 01:54:35,309
"Moon has become a vegabond,
the morning star has come out."

554
01:54:35,382 --> 01:54:58,103
Come my brother!
- You think i am drunk?

555
01:54:58,172 --> 01:55:19,584
"Not you, but i had a drink. Who
ever had it, it is not good."

556
01:55:19,660 --> 01:55:30,366
Enough of befriending the world.
I break my head otherwise.

557
01:55:30,437 --> 01:55:33,099
Enough of this now!

558
01:55:33,173 --> 01:55:42,411
Come my brother...

559
01:55:47,554 --> 01:56:04,393
"forgive me my friends,
i am drunk."

560
01:56:04,471 --> 01:56:27,226
When your elder brother is a
drunkard. What'll the younger do

561
01:56:27,294 --> 01:56:39,695
you decide what is good or bad.
I will leave it to you.

562
01:56:39,773 --> 01:56:42,333
I told you to go away!

563
01:56:42,409 --> 01:56:50,646
Come my brother...

564
01:57:19,847 --> 01:57:42,830
"the cabbie did not let me sit, &
carriage man showed his whip!"

565
01:57:43,070 --> 01:57:57,144
"I will make you sit on my back,
& i will take you. Come brother."

566
01:57:57,217 --> 01:58:01,176
"No, i don't want to go."

567
01:58:01,255 --> 01:58:05,214
Come by brother!

568
01:58:05,292 --> 01:58:19,468
"Being big, you want to bully your
younger brother you won't come.!"

569
01:58:19,540 --> 01:58:25,206
Ok then it is no talk with you.

570
01:58:38,325 --> 01:59:00,670
You are my sweet heart. My
life is for you.

571
01:59:00,747 --> 01:59:11,715
"If you love me, i'll break
this bottle."

572
01:59:11,792 --> 01:59:22,293
"No, no. Come my brother. I
request you. I beg you."

573
01:59:22,369 --> 01:59:24,667
"No, i'll not come."

574
01:59:24,738 --> 01:59:28,868
Come my brother...

575
01:59:29,076 --> 01:59:32,273
now you have come on line.
Come my brother...

576
01:59:36,083 --> 01:59:56,801
come my brother...

577
02:00:25,766 --> 02:00:29,224
"brother, she is my daughter.
- Greetings!"

578
02:00:32,139 --> 02:00:36,371
"Looking at you, i remember
your father."

579
02:00:36,443 --> 02:00:43,542
"He was not a friend, he was
more like a brother. If he was..."

580
02:00:43,617 --> 02:00:49,283
"...alive he would have been very
happy, this friendship is now..."

581
02:00:49,356 --> 02:00:59,254
"...changing into a relationship.
Come daughter, accept this."

582
02:00:59,333 --> 02:01:05,431
But mother<i>...</i>
- it is an offering. Accept it.

583
02:01:11,712 --> 02:01:15,773
"Hearing of her marriage, she is
blushing. Please sit down."

584
02:01:31,331 --> 02:01:37,099
So late? - Cat crossed the
path. That why the delay.

585
02:01:37,170 --> 02:01:47,705
"Who is it? - I told you mother,
we are college friends."

586
02:01:47,781 --> 02:01:54,448
Come sit down. It is a lucky day.
Offers have come for both...

587
02:01:54,521 --> 02:02:00,050
"...my daughters<i>. - </i>
come son, what is your name?"

588
02:02:00,127 --> 02:02:09,627
Sunny<i>. - </i> i didn't ask you. Your
parents? - They are not there.

589
02:02:09,703 --> 02:02:12,536
My elder brother is there<i>. - </i>
what does he do?

590
02:02:12,606 --> 02:02:19,603
He has a hotel business.
- What is your brother's name?

591
02:02:19,680 --> 02:02:24,049
"John<i>. - </i> john janardhan?
Yes, do you know him?"

592
02:02:24,117 --> 02:02:28,247
"Very well, he works as a
waiter in my hotel."

593
02:02:31,224 --> 02:02:36,992
"Lady, full marks to you. You
have a big heart."

594
02:02:37,064 --> 02:02:41,057
You are building a relationship
with your husband's murderer<i>...</i>

595
02:02:41,134 --> 02:02:47,767
...where people break
such relations.

596
02:02:48,008 --> 02:02:51,239
What are you saying! - 
ask him!

597
02:02:51,311 --> 02:02:55,111
"Aren't you namdev's son?
- Yes, so what!"

598
02:02:55,182 --> 02:02:58,447
Namdev is the same murderer
who killed one of our friends...

599
02:02:58,518 --> 02:03:02,545
...and orphaned these children.
- What?

600
02:03:02,622 --> 02:03:07,116
"Sister, i will go now. Once the
dates are fixed, i'll inform you."

601
02:03:07,194 --> 02:03:13,622
"You have lit the fire, now see
the smoke also."

602
02:03:13,700 --> 02:03:20,196
"I had come to see a girl for my
son, and not smoke."

603
02:03:20,273 --> 02:03:26,644
Get out of here. My daughter
cannot marry you.

604
02:03:26,713 --> 02:03:32,777
Why not? Why should we
dig up old things.

605
02:03:32,853 --> 02:03:40,487
He's awakened old memories.
Ask him to get out from here.

606
02:03:40,560 --> 02:03:43,461
"Why should he go? If he had
some bad qualities, i myself..."

607
02:03:43,530 --> 02:03:49,332
...would have told him to go.
I will not let this happen.

608
02:03:49,402 --> 02:03:53,236
You mean you are ready to marry
your father's murderer's son?

609
02:03:53,306 --> 02:03:55,706
What proof do you have that my
father is a murderer.

610
02:03:55,776 --> 02:03:59,337
Ask the whole world. Go and
see the police records.

611
02:03:59,412 --> 02:04:04,179
Certainly i will go
and check.

612
02:04:29,843 --> 02:04:32,368
Kill him

613
02:04:32,445 --> 02:04:38,406
he has accepted his defeat.

614
02:04:47,561 --> 02:04:53,591
There is no place for the
defeated here.

615
02:05:01,541 --> 02:05:04,772
There is no place also for those
who disobey me.

616
02:05:14,521 --> 02:05:20,391
I gave you a new life. To take
it back is my right.

617
02:05:22,429 --> 02:05:26,832
There is bad news from india.
Our friend kk has died in a...

618
02:05:26,900 --> 02:05:32,668
...helicopter explosion. And
damodar and raghbir are...

619
02:05:32,739 --> 02:05:37,608
...reportedly behind the blast<i>. - </i>
damodar & raghbir<i>...</i>?

620
02:05:37,677 --> 02:05:41,636
"Yes, your old friends damodar
and raghbir."

621
02:05:41,715 --> 02:05:49,713
"My friends, they trapped me in
a false murder case of..."

622
02:05:49,789 --> 02:05:52,223
...iottery ticket theft.

623
02:05:52,292 --> 02:05:56,058
"Namdev, you will go back to
india, and investigate kks death."

624
02:05:56,129 --> 02:05:59,826
How can i go to india? Police is
still searching for me there

625
02:06:00,066 --> 02:06:10,408
"you will not go as namdev, you
will go as don! - I am ready."

626
02:06:10,477 --> 02:06:14,846
You know what you have to
do and say in india?

627
02:06:15,081 --> 02:06:19,575
I have to punish kk's murderers
and inaugurate the...

628
02:06:19,653 --> 02:06:22,781
...new revolving restaurant.
- Good.

629
02:06:43,343 --> 02:06:46,540
How has don come to india
without informing us?

630
02:06:46,613 --> 02:06:52,483
We have never seen his
face<i>. - </i> yes i too.

631
02:06:52,552 --> 02:06:55,783
Then let us see him today.

632
02:07:21,314 --> 02:07:27,719
"No, you are damu and you are
raghubir. Changing clothes does..."

633
02:07:27,787 --> 02:07:34,590
...not change reality. You were a
cabbie and you a photographer.

634
02:07:34,661 --> 02:07:42,397
"How did you know all this, sir?"

635
02:07:42,469 --> 02:07:55,837
"I know each detail about those, i
do business with. I know all!"

636
02:07:56,082 --> 02:08:05,389
"But sir, what have we done?
- You will get to know all..."

637
02:08:14,534 --> 02:08:18,595
the ride has just started. Those
who puts others in a spin...

638
02:08:18,671 --> 02:08:22,630
...at times get caught in one
themselves<i>. - </i> which spins?

639
02:08:22,709 --> 02:08:32,641
There are many. Take episode
no. 1. lets forget it. No 2.

640
02:08:32,719 --> 02:08:38,316
Kk's case<i>. - </i> kk.? - We haven't
murdered kk.

641
02:08:38,391 --> 02:08:42,589
Which murderer accepts that
he has murdered somebody<i>...</i>

642
02:08:42,662 --> 02:08:49,295
clever murderers put the
blame on somebody else.

643
02:08:49,369 --> 02:08:52,634
"Really, we haven't murdered
anybody."

644
02:08:52,705 --> 02:08:57,301
We have our whole life to
prove all this.

645
02:09:12,459 --> 02:09:17,294
"Nobody will move from his place.
- Inspector, what is the problem."

646
02:09:17,363 --> 02:09:20,230
We have come to know that the
owner of this house is a big...

647
02:09:20,300 --> 02:09:24,100
...smuggler. Where is he? - We
don't know. We're servants here.

648
02:09:24,170 --> 02:09:29,437
We don't know when they
come and go.

649
02:09:29,509 --> 02:09:36,472
Do you have his photograph?
- There is his photo.

650
02:09:52,765 --> 02:09:57,498
No confusions. This is
rustom seth hotel.

651
02:10:08,681 --> 02:10:18,852
"Get the bill<i>. - </i> never a bill for
you, mrs. Gomes"

652
02:10:19,092 --> 02:10:24,530
"ok, i have brought a garland
from mahim church. Put it on..."

653
02:10:24,597 --> 02:10:27,657
...namdev's photograph.

654
02:10:43,183 --> 02:10:45,651
"Forgive me, sir."

655
02:10:59,032 --> 02:11:04,060
Give this to your boss and tell
him we are now quits.

656
02:11:13,780 --> 02:11:19,116
"Sir, namdev is alive, he just
gave me this money."

657
02:11:32,732 --> 02:11:35,292
One ticket to versova.

658
02:11:55,588 --> 02:12:04,462
"Mrs gomes, open your eyes.
Come to your senses and let..."

659
02:12:04,530 --> 02:12:08,489
...me know whether my wife and
kids are alive or not.

660
02:12:08,568 --> 02:12:15,167
"Doctor, make her conscious
as early as possible"

661
02:12:15,241 --> 02:12:19,405
"get her to a hospital<i>. - </i>
no, we will get everything..."

662
02:12:19,479 --> 02:12:23,848
...for you here. Let her
remain here.

663
02:12:26,586 --> 02:12:33,617
"Good news for you, our namdev
is alive<i>. - </i> no, he is dead."

664
02:12:33,693 --> 02:12:37,686
"No, just now he has
left my hotel."

665
02:12:37,764 --> 02:12:44,169
"Don't tell this to anybody, or
else the police will be after him."

666
02:12:49,509 --> 02:12:54,003
"Whom we think as don, is none
else but our old friend namdev."

667
02:12:54,080 --> 02:13:00,246
We will have to do something.
I will just tell damu.

668
02:13:01,754 --> 02:13:06,214
"Hold it, we had said about
removing damodar."

669
02:13:06,292 --> 02:13:13,562
Here is an opportunity to
finish damodar and his son.

670
02:13:13,633 --> 02:13:20,334
He is right. If damu uncle goes
with namdev how will it be.

671
02:13:20,406 --> 02:13:24,740
My marriage with julie! How did
you print these cards.

672
02:13:24,811 --> 02:13:29,111
If there is a crack in our
relationship it does not mean...

673
02:13:29,182 --> 02:13:33,482
"...our friendship is finished.
Remember, we had promised..."

674
02:13:33,553 --> 02:13:38,547
"...we will marry on the same
day. Friend, i've come to fulfil<i>...</i>"

675
02:13:38,624 --> 02:13:45,325
...our promise. Whether you keep
your promise is up to you.

676
02:13:45,398 --> 02:13:48,458
But i cannot get married
this way.

677
02:13:50,303 --> 02:13:54,069
"Remember you said, friendship
takes your test sometimes<i>...</i>"

678
02:13:54,140 --> 02:13:58,736
...today it is your test friend.

679
02:14:04,384 --> 02:14:09,879
"Friend, you only remembered
friendship tests."

680
02:14:10,123 --> 02:14:14,423
You forgot friendship
takes life sometimes.

681
02:14:37,583 --> 02:14:41,144
"Look, julie is there."

682
02:15:22,295 --> 02:15:27,289
"Where is vicky? - There, next
to the phone."

683
02:15:30,603 --> 02:15:35,199
Looks you will have to get
married alone<i>...</i>

684
02:15:35,274 --> 02:15:39,301
julie is suddenly missing. I
have searched the whole city.

685
02:15:39,378 --> 02:15:45,214
"A bride is not searched in the
city, but in the marriage hall."

686
02:15:45,284 --> 02:15:50,483
She is upstairs getting ready.
- Julie is here?

687
02:15:50,556 --> 02:15:55,255
"Yes, if you don't bellieve me, go
and see with your own eyes."

688
02:15:57,597 --> 02:16:01,397
"Contact my advocate, mr
venkateshwar<i>...</i>"

689
02:16:12,144 --> 02:16:17,138
"julie, what are you doing in
a bridal dress."

690
02:16:20,119 --> 02:16:23,850
"Julie, how can we get married.
You know we had just acted..."

691
02:16:24,090 --> 02:16:27,389
...to convince asha and
vicky. I lost friendship and...

692
02:16:27,460 --> 02:16:33,296
"...sacrificed my love, now let us
go. This place is not for us."

693
02:16:37,136 --> 02:16:43,632
This assembly and this place is
not for us<i>... - </i> you? And here?

694
02:16:43,709 --> 02:16:47,702
"Yes, you sacrificed your love to
save a friend. Isn't it?"

695
02:16:47,780 --> 02:16:56,313
There to save a brother-sister
relationship julie has<i>... - </i> what?

696
02:16:57,590 --> 02:17:00,218
Come with me.

697
02:17:08,634 --> 02:17:18,100
What happened? - She was
attempting suicide. If i hadn't...

698
02:17:18,177 --> 02:17:21,840
"...reached, god knows what
would have happened."

699
02:17:29,755 --> 02:17:33,020
"You rascals, you just
increased my price!"

700
02:17:40,199 --> 02:17:49,369
"A girl loved me since childhood,
and i played with her life!"

701
02:17:49,442 --> 02:17:57,508
"And you my friend, you were
ready to sacrifice your love..."

702
02:17:57,583 --> 02:18:00,177
...& life for me! Don't love me
so much that my heart bursts.

703
02:18:00,252 --> 02:18:04,552
Death can never take away my
friend. It doesn't know that...

704
02:18:04,624 --> 02:18:09,561
"...without taking johnny life, it
cannot even look at you."

705
02:18:09,629 --> 02:18:20,062
"With friends like you, death is
only for his enemies."

706
02:18:28,648 --> 02:18:43,018
"With this girls love, i consider i
have found heaven. Come."

707
02:18:50,069 --> 02:18:54,130
"And your love, i place in
your hands."

708
02:18:57,743 --> 02:19:01,702
"Vicky, you have arranged
everything. Now i too should..."

709
02:19:01,781 --> 02:19:07,742
...my love<i>. - </i> don't worry. If my
younger daughter gets married...

710
02:19:07,820 --> 02:19:14,316
...it will only be with you.
- But that day you had said<i>...</i>

711
02:19:14,393 --> 02:19:19,126
the father of a man who did so
much for his friend can never...

712
02:19:19,198 --> 02:19:22,634
...be a murderer. You prepare
for the marriage.

713
02:19:22,702 --> 02:19:26,695
"What is the matter, son. Who is
getting married to whom?"

714
02:19:26,772 --> 02:19:31,641
"I am getting married not to
asha, but to julie."

715
02:19:31,711 --> 02:19:35,511
With julie?
- You think marriage is a joke?

716
02:19:35,581 --> 02:19:40,314
You will get married to asha.

717
02:19:40,386 --> 02:19:50,284
"Father, listen to me, try &
understand."

718
02:20:13,319 --> 02:20:16,755
Raghu's son!

719
02:20:16,822 --> 02:20:18,687
There he is!

720
02:20:28,801 --> 02:20:30,496
There!

721
02:23:18,103 --> 02:23:21,266
Take them inside
and tie them up

722
02:23:57,209 --> 02:24:00,372
"halt, who are you?"

723
02:24:00,446 --> 02:24:02,744
Why have you brought
my friend here.

724
02:24:02,815 --> 02:24:04,407
It is a personal matter.

725
02:24:04,483 --> 02:24:09,284
My friend's personal matters are
my personal matters.

726
02:24:11,390 --> 02:24:15,383
So you will take him
from here.

727
02:24:15,461 --> 02:24:18,862
"If i don't take him,
i am not my fathers son."

728
02:24:19,098 --> 02:24:21,498
"Take care of your youth,
and return."

729
02:24:21,567 --> 02:24:25,196
I am explaining because
i am like your father.

730
02:24:25,270 --> 02:24:31,209
"And i say the same. Take care
of your age, and give my friend."

731
02:24:31,276 --> 02:24:34,268
"I am explaining, because i am
like your son."

732
02:24:34,346 --> 02:24:35,813
No!

733
02:25:27,232 --> 02:25:33,262
God gave me consciousness at
the right time. Otherwise you...

734
02:25:33,338 --> 02:25:43,407
...would have killed your own
son<i>. - </i> what are you saying!

735
02:25:43,482 --> 02:25:52,390
"He is your elder son, johnny."

736
02:26:08,307 --> 02:26:12,607
Damodar and raghu thought i'm
dead & threw me into a river.

737
02:26:12,678 --> 02:26:17,775
"A man named don saved me, and
took me abroad. There i came to"

738
02:26:17,850 --> 02:26:23,311
...know my family was finished
in the koyna earthquake.

739
02:26:23,388 --> 02:26:27,552
"Then don sent me here to india,
for some urgent work."

740
02:26:27,626 --> 02:26:34,759
"Now unless i find out the actual
killers of kk, i will not return."

741
02:26:34,833 --> 02:26:42,262
"If that is so, then damu's son
will not go unless his father..."

742
02:26:42,341 --> 02:26:47,108
...acknowledges his crime and
your innocence is proved.

743
02:27:00,726 --> 02:27:06,858
"Why? Are you surprised to see
me alive? I am not namdev..."

744
02:27:07,099 --> 02:27:14,369
...who'll die easily. I am damu.
Damu! I will see you are hanged.

745
02:27:14,439 --> 02:27:19,274
Your thinking is wrong. He
wanted to kill namdev's sons.

746
02:27:19,344 --> 02:27:26,580
"No, i don't believe it. I will ring
up the police and tell them you..."

747
02:27:26,652 --> 02:27:31,612
...murdered jaggi and namdev<i>. - </i>
come off the high horse<i>...</i>

748
02:27:31,690 --> 02:27:34,818
"if i get caught, you will
also get implicated."

749
02:27:35,060 --> 02:27:43,559
"No, for i have proof. You don't
believe it? See!"

750
02:27:51,510 --> 02:27:59,508
When you committed the murder i
took the photographs<i>...</i>

751
02:27:59,585 --> 02:28:03,715
"i knew, one day you will cheat
me. And these photos will help."

752
02:29:08,587 --> 02:29:12,284
"Raghu, i wil not leave you!"

753
02:29:35,113 --> 02:29:40,107
What have you done. He has
the photo in his hands.

754
02:29:42,387 --> 02:29:56,427
Your father is innocent. He did
not murder jaggi. Raghu did it.

755
02:29:56,501 --> 02:30:00,267
See he is talking. Hurry and
get the photos.

756
02:30:00,339 --> 02:30:17,178
The proof of your father's
innocence is in the pouch.

757
02:30:45,684 --> 02:30:51,213
"Get down. I say, get down."

758
02:30:53,492 --> 02:30:59,260
Taking away proof of your
father's innocence? Come up.

759
02:30:59,331 --> 02:31:02,061
We sent him down. We will
now take you up.

760
02:31:06,805 --> 02:31:09,137
Here is namdev's son!

761
02:31:09,207 --> 02:31:12,301
What did damodar give you
before he died.

762
02:31:12,377 --> 02:31:14,743
Your death warrant! - What
nonsense are you talking.

763
02:31:14,813 --> 02:31:16,838
You haven't given up your old
habit of shouting?

764
02:31:17,082 --> 02:31:20,540
"Talk properly, you fool"

765
02:31:23,855 --> 02:31:27,814
thank god i am not using my
hands. If i had come to know...

766
02:31:28,059 --> 02:31:32,086
"...of your crime, instead of damu,
you would have been there!"

767
02:31:32,164 --> 02:31:35,361
Hand over the photos<i>. - </i>
hurry up!

768
02:31:35,434 --> 02:31:39,131
These now i'll hand
over to the police.

769
02:31:39,204 --> 02:31:41,138
Really!

770
02:31:55,754 --> 02:32:00,350
"Let the proof burn.
This proof is burnt, daddy."

771
02:32:00,425 --> 02:32:03,223
Should we finish him now?

772
02:32:06,631 --> 02:32:10,761
"Raghu, this is namdev speaking.
- Dying people should be silent."

773
02:32:10,836 --> 02:32:16,832
I am saying that it is time now
for you & your sons to die.

774
02:32:17,075 --> 02:32:24,846
"Namdev this is your mistake.
- Dad, save me."

775
02:32:25,083 --> 02:32:36,620
Now go to the police station
and give your confession.

776
02:32:36,695 --> 02:32:40,597
"Not so soon,
atleast talk to your son."

777
02:32:43,034 --> 02:32:48,438
"Father, don't worry about me. Go
immediately to the police station."

778
02:32:52,477 --> 02:32:56,345
You heard your son's voice. Now
return my son or i will give him<i>...</i>

779
02:32:56,414 --> 02:33:00,077
...the same treatment i gave to
damu<i>. - </i> to damu?

780
02:33:00,151 --> 02:33:07,080
"I have sent him to his friend
jaggi. If you want your son..."

781
02:33:07,158 --> 02:33:09,683
...get my son to the revolving
restaurant at sharp 2 oclock.

782
02:33:09,761 --> 02:33:14,357
Take your son
and give me mine.

783
02:33:40,392 --> 02:33:44,328
You thought by exchanging sons
you will be saved.

784
02:33:44,396 --> 02:33:47,456
"When police get to know you are
namdev, then what will happen."

785
02:33:47,532 --> 02:33:51,229
What will happen when they
come to know that you are...

786
02:33:51,303 --> 02:33:56,104
"...jagdish's actual murderer,
what then?"

787
02:33:56,174 --> 02:34:04,548
Who has the proof?
Proof is here.

788
02:34:20,632 --> 02:34:26,571
"If anyone tries to move, his
death is behind him."

789
02:34:26,638 --> 02:34:35,512
Who are you? - 
don.

790
02:34:35,580 --> 02:34:41,382
I am actual don. Stop fighting
amongst yourself. First complete<i>...</i>

791
02:34:41,453 --> 02:34:45,116
"...the job, i have come here for."

792
02:34:47,158 --> 02:34:51,720
"Namdev, you come along with
me. Look after them."

793
02:34:57,669 --> 02:35:02,072
After today's inauguration you
will have to go to hong kong.

794
02:35:02,140 --> 02:35:06,543
Hong kong police had come to
arrest don here.

795
02:35:06,611 --> 02:35:20,150
"But you are don<i>. - </i> i am don for
you, but to police u are the don."

796
02:35:20,225 --> 02:35:28,428
"So in hong kong, you surrender,
& very soon, i'll get you freed."

797
02:35:28,500 --> 02:35:33,460
Then i will hand over your proof
of innocence also to you.

798
02:35:33,538 --> 02:35:36,666
I will hand over your proof<i>...</i>

799
02:35:36,741 --> 02:35:44,375
if i refuse then? - You won't.
Here i will tear your proof to...

800
02:35:44,449 --> 02:35:49,318
...shreds and your sons will be
torn to pieces outside.

801
02:36:06,438 --> 02:36:10,636
"Here, each one of you put
on these rings."

802
02:36:10,709 --> 02:36:13,542
Why have you given these
rings to us?

803
02:36:13,611 --> 02:36:17,206
"They have jesus, allah and om
on them. It has the divinity."

804
02:36:17,282 --> 02:36:22,652
Now you all go home.
- But we can't allow...

805
02:36:22,721 --> 02:36:26,282
i am ordering you go
from here.

806
02:36:26,357 --> 02:36:31,624
And ring me up when
you reach home.

807
02:36:35,133 --> 02:36:40,799
"Raghu, you come here.
Let the three go."

808
02:36:45,376 --> 02:36:49,369
"Raghubir, my friend's father
ordered and i'm going."

809
02:36:49,447 --> 02:36:54,441
But to take revenge for my
father's death i will come later.

810
02:37:12,103 --> 02:37:17,598
"Remember raghu, don't ever kill
your enemy in your house."

811
02:37:17,675 --> 02:37:25,309
Kill him in his own house.
Nobody will suspect then.

812
02:37:25,383 --> 02:37:34,758
"When namdev's children ring up
their father, my son will..."

813
02:37:34,826 --> 02:37:40,093
...finish all of them.

814
02:37:46,337 --> 02:37:49,534
There they go!

815
02:37:57,849 --> 02:38:01,250
It looks they can't hear us.
Let us go.

816
02:38:18,069 --> 02:38:26,499
"You have reached safely? - Yes
father, but<i>... - </i> don't worry."

817
02:38:26,578 --> 02:38:28,739
"Father, why didn't you come with
us? - I will tell at the right time"

818
02:38:28,813 --> 02:38:34,149
"but till i come, remain together
and look after each other."

819
02:38:34,219 --> 02:38:38,178
Why? I hope everything
is alright.

820
02:38:56,107 --> 02:39:01,272
The same will happen to you<i>. - </i>
you! - Who is he?

821
02:39:01,346 --> 02:39:06,443
"I am don's son, and your death.
Mr vicky, because of you i lost..."

822
02:39:06,517 --> 02:39:09,714
...my london casino license.
Today i have the opportunity...

823
02:39:09,787 --> 02:39:12,347
...to take revenge. Come!

824
02:39:18,062 --> 02:39:23,193
Halt. Dad will be very happy
listening to news of your death.

825
02:39:23,268 --> 02:39:29,696
Kneel down. Haven't you heard?
Get on to your knees.

826
02:39:29,774 --> 02:39:33,505
Any last wish!

827
02:39:38,049 --> 02:39:41,109
Even if there was who would
have fulfilled it?

828
02:39:53,464 --> 02:39:55,830
"Mother, mother!"

829
02:40:28,299 --> 02:40:33,293
"Julie, don't cry. We will take
revenge for your mother's death."

830
02:40:33,371 --> 02:40:40,573
Your dad is waiting. Tell him you
have finished us all three.

831
02:40:40,645 --> 02:40:49,110
On your knees!

832
02:40:49,187 --> 02:40:56,491
"Dad, i have finished all three.
- Well done."

833
02:41:09,040 --> 02:41:11,736
Your dad's life is in danger.
Save him. I also heard they...

834
02:41:11,809 --> 02:41:15,267
...will take him to hong kong
after inauguration.

835
02:41:15,346 --> 02:41:19,407
"Besides saving him, we have to
get the proof of his innocence."

836
02:41:19,484 --> 02:41:23,853
How will we go there? - Tonight
our group has a program there

837
02:41:24,088 --> 02:41:28,616
"ok, let the program be yours,
but troupe will be ours."

838
02:42:39,630 --> 02:42:56,002
We will leave an imprint of
color and intrigue here.

839
02:42:56,080 --> 02:43:36,209
We will put everybody
in a spin here.

840
02:44:00,244 --> 02:44:13,487
"Who will understand our moves,
who is a player like us."

841
02:44:13,558 --> 02:44:25,368
We will play a game and
people will watch the fun.

842
02:44:25,436 --> 02:44:49,716
People will clap and go.
We will leave an imprint here.

843
02:45:17,555 --> 02:45:26,463
"See if you can engage with eyes,
see if you can touch us!"

844
02:45:26,530 --> 02:45:52,585
Try and come in front of us.
We will make heroes to zeroes.

845
02:46:40,371 --> 02:46:53,444
"You may think we are loafers,
you may think we are jokers."

846
02:46:53,517 --> 02:47:05,088
"We are the servants of theatre,
we will raise the curtains!"

847
02:47:06,163 --> 02:47:13,501
And we will also drop
the curtains.

848
02:47:24,582 --> 02:47:39,395
We will put every one in a spin.

849
02:47:49,367 --> 02:47:52,996
"Dad, namdev's sons have run
away<i>. - </i> run away!"

850
02:47:53,071 --> 02:47:57,599
But you had said<i>...</i> and what

851

This is the punishment of jesus.

852
02:48:01,045 --> 02:48:04,276
This is the retribution of allah.

853
02:48:04,349 --> 02:48:08,615
And the vengeance of om.

854

"Son, the proof of my innocence
is in his pocket."

855
02:48:13,257 --> 02:48:18,285
"Don't worry, those photos have
been taken by the girls."

856
02:48:22,834 --> 02:48:24,324
Come.

"come, lets go,

860
02:54:26,197 --> 02:54:28,597

They don't have the pulleys.

863
02:55:35,065 --> 02:55:42,597
"Om, allah, and jesus are with
you. Make pulleys out of rings."

864
02:55:46,811 --> 02:55:49,746
Take out your rings.

"Go carefully, father."

868
02:56:50,908 --> 02:56:53,536
Somebody is coming
from the back.

869
02:58:14,858 --> 02:58:17,827
"I told you, i don't have the
money. Where'll i give it from?"

870
02:58:17,895 --> 02:58:20,796
"If you don't have the money,
why drink and eat?"

871
02:58:20,864 --> 02:58:29,272
I have this 5 lakh lottery ticket.
