1
00:08:37,466 --> 00:08:42,165
End of song, beginning of story.

2
00:08:54,850 --> 00:08:58,183
Man, dig that crazy rehearsal hall.

3
00:08:58,354 --> 00:09:01,687
What a powerful pile of rock.
l can't go in there.

4
00:09:01,857 --> 00:09:05,725
-Why can't you go in there?
-l ain't got my library card.

5
00:09:05,895 --> 00:09:08,056
Dig you.

6
00:09:08,231 --> 00:09:11,564
-Are you the musicians?
-That's what the man said.

7
00:09:11,734 --> 00:09:15,397
-What name shall l say?
-Tell Dex old Satchelmouth.

8
00:09:15,571 --> 00:09:18,472
Will you please follow me,
Mr. Satchelmouth?

9
00:09:18,641 --> 00:09:23,738
Wipe your feet, boys. Something
tells me we've got a long walk ahead.

10
00:09:29,452 --> 00:09:32,717
Hey, pops! How's the chops?
Good to see you, boy!

11
00:09:32,888 --> 00:09:35,413
-Hey, fellas!
-How's everything?

12
00:09:35,591 --> 00:09:38,458
You've been all over
Europe since l saw you.

13
00:09:38,628 --> 00:09:39,925
-Go to Sweden?
-Yes.

14
00:09:40,096 --> 00:09:42,428
-Skol.
-l was the skol-est cat ever.

15
00:09:42,598 --> 00:09:46,534
l bet you were. Here it is, fellas.
Just lay it out here.

16
00:09:46,702 --> 00:09:49,364
l never thought you lived
in a big house.

17
00:09:49,538 --> 00:09:52,666
Shows what happens when your
grandfather's a robber baron.

18
00:09:52,842 --> 00:09:56,573
-You can play football in here.
-But can you rehearse?

19
00:09:56,746 --> 00:10:00,409
-ls the chandelier tied tight?
-lf it swings, put a mute in your horn.

20
00:10:00,583 --> 00:10:03,177
Pardon me.
The ladies are waiting in the library.

21
00:10:03,352 --> 00:10:04,819
Vamp a little, will you?

22
00:10:04,987 --> 00:10:06,420
-Okay, Dex.
-All right.

23
00:10:08,190 --> 00:10:09,179
Ladies?

24
00:10:09,358 --> 00:10:10,620
-Dexter.
-Hello, Ruth.

25
00:10:10,793 --> 00:10:13,227
Thanks for letting the
musicians rehearse here.

26
00:10:13,396 --> 00:10:15,591
-Tickled to death.
-You saved the festival.

27
00:10:15,765 --> 00:10:17,323
As long as l can save you.

28
00:10:17,500 --> 00:10:18,694
-Hello, Helen.
-Save us?

29
00:10:18,868 --> 00:10:22,065
You know you might lose
your billing in the blue book?

30
00:10:22,238 --> 00:10:23,933
Jazz is considered very unchic.

31
00:10:24,106 --> 00:10:25,664
Oh, l'm sure we'll love it.

32
00:10:25,841 --> 00:10:27,502
Let us know if we can help.

33
00:10:27,677 --> 00:10:29,668
l will. Thanks a lot for coming by.

34
00:10:29,845 --> 00:10:31,676
-Thank you.
-We'll keep in touch.

35
00:10:31,847 --> 00:10:34,077
-You bet. Bye.
-Bye.

36
00:10:35,751 --> 00:10:39,448
-Hello?
-Hello, Dexter?

37
00:10:39,622 --> 00:10:42,682
-This is Caroline.
-Hello, beautiful.

38
00:10:43,225 --> 00:10:46,285
Any time now.

39
00:10:51,133 --> 00:10:53,226
Where's Tracy?
l've been yelling for her.

40
00:10:53,402 --> 00:10:55,700
You don't yell, Caroline.
You call a person.

41
00:10:55,871 --> 00:10:57,930
You yell if you're in pain.

42
00:10:58,107 --> 00:11:01,565
Well, this wedding gives me a pain.

43
00:11:02,311 --> 00:11:04,905
l think Tracy was awful
mean to divorce Dexter.

44
00:11:05,081 --> 00:11:06,275
Can l have this?

45
00:11:06,449 --> 00:11:10,078
Oh, and take those presents
over to the other table.

46
00:11:10,486 --> 00:11:13,478
Mother, Tracy's sort of hard, isn't she?

47
00:11:13,656 --> 00:11:17,183
Not hard. None of my children are
that, l hope. The goblets too.

48
00:11:17,360 --> 00:11:20,329
Tracy's just exceptionally
strong-minded.

49
00:11:20,496 --> 00:11:23,795
And very wonderful always.

50
00:11:24,100 --> 00:11:27,035
l wish something would
happen around here.

51
00:11:27,203 --> 00:11:29,797
Nothing definitely ever happens here.

52
00:11:29,972 --> 00:11:32,338
Out of the way, angel.
You'll get stepped on.

53
00:11:32,508 --> 00:11:36,000
So far, l've received 24 nut dishes
and 1 6 silver ice picks.

54
00:11:36,178 --> 00:11:39,909
That should give you an idea of what
people think of your next husband.

55
00:11:40,082 --> 00:11:45,349
Mother, don't you think Caroline's old
enough to go to a good military school?

56
00:11:45,654 --> 00:11:48,782
-What's this?
-l haven't the faintest idea.

57
00:11:48,958 --> 00:11:51,552
-lt stinks.
-Don't say stinks, darling.

58
00:11:51,727 --> 00:11:57,359
lf absolutely necessary, ""smells,""
but only if absolutely necessary.

59
00:11:57,700 --> 00:12:00,828
lf you put this picture in my
wedding presents once more...

60
00:12:01,003 --> 00:12:04,302
...l'm going to personally
chain you to your bed.

61
00:12:04,473 --> 00:12:06,941
Why, what is it, dear?

62
00:12:08,377 --> 00:12:11,904
-He was handsome.
-Don't talk of him as if he were dead.

63
00:12:12,081 --> 00:12:13,639
Well, he is dead to me.

64
00:12:13,816 --> 00:12:17,877
And if that picture turns up once more,
it's going right in the ashcan.

65
00:12:18,053 --> 00:12:19,315
Well, look at this.

66
00:12:19,488 --> 00:12:22,184
-Wow. Jewels.
-From Father.

67
00:12:22,358 --> 00:12:23,655
lsn't it pretty?

68
00:12:23,826 --> 00:12:25,885
His girlfriend probably turned it down.

69
00:12:26,061 --> 00:12:29,292
-That's not fair to your father.
-How can you defend him?

70
00:12:29,465 --> 00:12:31,057
A common chorus girl.

71
00:12:31,233 --> 00:12:34,634
She's not a chorus girl.
She's quite a talented ballet dancer.

72
00:12:35,771 --> 00:12:39,434
lsn't it stinking of Tracy
not to invite Father to the wedding?

73
00:12:39,608 --> 00:12:42,600
Yes, Caroline. Just between us,
it's good and stinking.

74
00:12:42,778 --> 00:12:44,075
Me too.

75
00:12:44,246 --> 00:12:47,647
Oh, darling, why don't you
face facts squarely as l did?

76
00:12:47,817 --> 00:12:52,083
We might face the fact that neither
of us has been a great success as a wife.

77
00:12:52,254 --> 00:12:56,122
We both took the only stand a woman
could take and keep her self-respect.

78
00:12:56,292 --> 00:12:57,919
-Yes, dear.
-The Hammonds.

79
00:12:58,093 --> 00:13:01,585
And now l have my self-respect
and no husband.

80
00:13:01,764 --> 00:13:04,961
-Oh, we're both better off. Believe me.
-Yes, dear.

81
00:13:05,134 --> 00:13:07,193
-And we're both happier.
-Yes, dear.

82
00:13:07,369 --> 00:13:10,338
-Oh, isn't George an angel?
-Yes, George is an angel.

83
00:13:10,506 --> 00:13:13,600
-Now, is he handsome, or is he not?
-George is handsome.

84
00:13:13,776 --> 00:13:16,677
Golly Moses, l'm a lucky girl.

85
00:13:19,782 --> 00:13:23,513
Tracy, that's your song.
Dexter must be home.

86
00:13:23,686 --> 00:13:25,551
Mother, has Dexter come back?

87
00:13:25,721 --> 00:13:29,418
Well, we knew Dexter was giving
his house over to this festival.

88
00:13:29,592 --> 00:13:31,457
l suppose he might have come back.

89
00:13:31,627 --> 00:13:34,653
He's back. No one but Dexter
would play that song.

90
00:13:34,830 --> 00:13:38,391
That wretched, cheap, vulgar song.

91
00:13:38,801 --> 00:13:43,363
That beautiful, wonderful song
he wrote especially for her.

92
00:13:43,539 --> 00:13:45,871
That's gratitude.

93
00:14:12,501 --> 00:14:14,935
He's gonna get nowhere
with that kind of music.

94
00:14:15,104 --> 00:14:17,902
Good for the feet,
nothing for the heart.

95
00:14:18,674 --> 00:14:20,665
Hello, Sam.

96
00:14:20,843 --> 00:14:22,708
l'd like to talk to you privately.

97
00:14:22,878 --> 00:14:26,279
Well, now, l consider that
right neighborly.

98
00:14:27,249 --> 00:14:29,911
You lost a little weight,
haven't you, Sam?

99
00:14:30,085 --> 00:14:32,849
Oh, no, you're slipping.
That used to scare me.

100
00:14:33,022 --> 00:14:35,115
The withering glance of the goddess.

101
00:14:35,291 --> 00:14:39,022
l just want to know what you are
doing here the day before my wedding.

102
00:14:39,194 --> 00:14:41,822
Business. l've become a
distinguished composer--

103
00:14:41,997 --> 00:14:43,021
Oh, distinguished.

104
00:14:43,198 --> 00:14:46,031
They needed help here,
so l heeded the call of duty.

105
00:14:46,201 --> 00:14:47,896
Don't pretend with me, Dexter.

106
00:14:48,070 --> 00:14:51,938
You deliberately planned this
festival to conflict with my wedding.

107
00:14:52,107 --> 00:14:55,076
lt's a shabby, vindictive gesture.

108
00:14:55,244 --> 00:14:59,442
Harsh words. Well, let's be honest.
l'll admit it. l'm still in love with you.

109
00:14:59,615 --> 00:15:03,051
l don't want you to get married.
You can still be a wonderful woman.

110
00:15:03,218 --> 00:15:07,279
-l haven't the same high hopes for you.
-l don't wanna be a wonderful woman.

111
00:15:07,456 --> 00:15:10,914
lsn't it enough you almost spoiled my life
without spoiling my wedding?

112
00:15:11,093 --> 00:15:14,460
-l didn't try to spoil your life, Sam.
-And stop calling me Sam.

113
00:15:14,630 --> 00:15:17,565
l know you didn't try to spoil mine,
but you called the shots.

114
00:15:17,733 --> 00:15:20,327
You were dictating the fellow
you wanted me to be.

115
00:15:20,502 --> 00:15:23,630
With your background
and taste and intelligence...

116
00:15:23,806 --> 00:15:27,742
...you could have become a
serious composer, or a diplomat...

117
00:15:27,910 --> 00:15:30,606
...or anything you wanted to be.

118
00:15:30,779 --> 00:15:35,182
And what have you become?
A jukebox hero?

119
00:15:35,351 --> 00:15:37,717
Well, is that bad?

120
00:15:37,886 --> 00:15:41,845
Dexter, be satisfied and let me alone.

121
00:15:42,024 --> 00:15:44,515
Go away. Go away and stay away.

122
00:15:44,693 --> 00:15:46,558
l tried to. l even wanted to.

123
00:15:46,729 --> 00:15:51,063
But l guess l'm just a weak character.
l'm still in love with you.

124
00:15:57,506 --> 00:15:59,440
Dexter?

125
00:15:59,608 --> 00:16:01,633
Oh, hello, honey.

126
00:16:02,544 --> 00:16:06,480
-l don't think your sister likes me.
-l do.

127
00:16:06,649 --> 00:16:08,674
Thanks, sweetie.

128
00:16:08,851 --> 00:16:11,581
What do you suppose
she sees in George anyway?

129
00:16:11,754 --> 00:16:15,781
l don't know. Tracy just
likes character, l guess.

130
00:16:15,958 --> 00:16:18,791
l don't think George
has so much character.

131
00:16:18,961 --> 00:16:23,125
Now, l hate to admit it, but l think
she's made a pretty good choice.

132
00:16:23,298 --> 00:16:27,200
l expect some day to see George Kittredge
president of Redfern Coal.

133
00:16:27,369 --> 00:16:31,533
That's not hard.
Father's president of Redfern Coal.

134
00:16:31,707 --> 00:16:33,174
Let's be fair now, honey.

135
00:16:33,342 --> 00:16:37,210
Takes a lot of character to start at
the bottom and work your way up.

136
00:16:37,379 --> 00:16:39,904
lf you start at the bottom
of a coal mine...

137
00:16:40,082 --> 00:16:42,312
...and worked your way to the top...

138
00:16:42,484 --> 00:16:44,452
...you'd still only be on the ground.

139
00:16:44,620 --> 00:16:47,487
Little one, you've brought
up an interesting point.

140
00:16:47,656 --> 00:16:51,524
Why does he always have to walk
like he owned the world?

141
00:16:51,760 --> 00:16:54,228
And the way he stiffs the air?

142
00:16:54,396 --> 00:16:56,227
Like he was looking for breakfast.

143
00:16:56,398 --> 00:16:59,890
For a minute there, l thought
you were George Kittredge himself.

144
00:17:00,069 --> 00:17:02,230
No, you're Caroline.

145
00:17:07,509 --> 00:17:08,771
Hi.

146
00:17:11,547 --> 00:17:13,412
-Hello, beautiful.
-Hello, handsome.

147
00:17:13,582 --> 00:17:15,049
-Did you miss me?
-Miserably.

148
00:17:15,217 --> 00:17:17,242
-You happy now?
-Ecstatic.

149
00:17:17,419 --> 00:17:19,944
Didn't expect to find
you coming from the garden.

150
00:17:20,122 --> 00:17:24,559
Dexter's back. He's turned his
house over to those musicians.

151
00:17:24,727 --> 00:17:27,719
Yes, l know.
The posters are all over town.

152
00:17:27,896 --> 00:17:32,128
George? You don't really
mind him, do you?

153
00:17:32,301 --> 00:17:34,360
Dexter? Well, how do you mean?

154
00:17:34,536 --> 00:17:38,097
Well, l mean, the fact of him.

155
00:17:38,340 --> 00:17:40,205
l still don't understand, dear.

156
00:17:40,375 --> 00:17:43,173
You know, that he was....

157
00:17:43,345 --> 00:17:47,179
Well, my lord and master.

158
00:17:47,349 --> 00:17:49,840
No one has ever been
your lord and master.

159
00:17:50,018 --> 00:17:51,610
Until now.

160
00:17:52,488 --> 00:17:58,017
Poor Dexter is the sort of man whose
inheritance robbed him of his heritage.

161
00:17:58,193 --> 00:18:01,685
He never earned you, so how could
he be expected to appreciate you?

162
00:18:01,864 --> 00:18:05,322
-George, you're so good for me.
-l hope so.

163
00:18:05,667 --> 00:18:07,532
Dexter?

164
00:18:07,703 --> 00:18:09,796
Are you ever gonna
get married again?

165
00:18:09,972 --> 00:18:14,136
Sure l am. But l'm waiting
for you to grow up.

166
00:18:14,309 --> 00:18:17,369
-Dexter, for you l'll hurry.
-Yes, you're gonna have to.

167
00:18:17,546 --> 00:18:21,676
l wouldn't have acted the way Tracy did
when you published your song about her.

168
00:18:21,850 --> 00:18:25,809
-l wish you'd write a song about me.
-Would you like that? Really?

169
00:18:25,988 --> 00:18:29,515
Well, we ought to be able
to whip something up here.

170
00:19:56,879 --> 00:20:02,215
Dexter, that was beautiful.
l consider us engaged.

171
00:20:38,587 --> 00:20:42,455
Right song, but the wrong girl.

172
00:20:50,632 --> 00:20:53,965
Hello? Oh, hello,
Willie, l'm glad you called.

173
00:20:54,136 --> 00:20:57,765
Cousin Martha just phoned.
She wants me to give you lunch.

174
00:20:57,940 --> 00:21:00,431
She wants you out of the house.

175
00:21:00,609 --> 00:21:02,008
Well, where are you?

176
00:21:02,177 --> 00:21:06,341
l'm in the office
of the editor of SPY magazine.

177
00:21:06,515 --> 00:21:11,179
No, no, no.
Spy. lt rhymes with lie.

178
00:21:12,955 --> 00:21:19,417
Right. Now, he wants to send a couple
of reporters up to cover Tracy's wedding.

179
00:21:19,594 --> 00:21:21,755
Now, don't explode, my dear.

180
00:21:21,930 --> 00:21:26,663
l have just read an article right
here on the editor's desk...

181
00:21:26,835 --> 00:21:30,032
...about your husband and that dancer.

182
00:21:30,672 --> 00:21:32,799
You know.

183
00:21:33,342 --> 00:21:36,834
But it's blackmail.
Beside, Tracy would never allow it.

184
00:21:37,012 --> 00:21:41,312
Now, if you will allow
a reporter and a photographer...

185
00:21:41,483 --> 00:21:43,849
...into your home to
cover Tracy's wedding...

186
00:21:44,019 --> 00:21:47,420
...l have the editor's word
as a gentleman...

187
00:21:47,589 --> 00:21:52,492
...that he will withhold
the article on your husband.

188
00:21:52,728 --> 00:21:56,220
All right, Willie,
l suppose we have no choice.

189
00:21:56,631 --> 00:21:59,464
Tracy'll hit the ceiling.

190
00:21:59,634 --> 00:22:01,431
Goodbye.

191
00:22:01,636 --> 00:22:03,900
Mother!

192
00:22:04,906 --> 00:22:08,899
George came early. l'll tell Edward
to set another place for lunch.

193
00:22:09,077 --> 00:22:11,705
-l'm pooped.
-No, dear, you're enervated.

194
00:22:11,880 --> 00:22:13,472
l'm pooped too.

195
00:22:13,648 --> 00:22:16,776
There is one thing
l want understood right now.

196
00:22:16,952 --> 00:22:20,888
No member of my family is to
invite Dexter-Haven into this house...

197
00:22:21,056 --> 00:22:23,752
...until after l am married and gone.

198
00:22:23,925 --> 00:22:27,053
l will not have my wedding
spoiled by intruders.

199
00:22:27,229 --> 00:22:28,958
-Tracy.
-Yes?

200
00:22:29,131 --> 00:22:33,500
l'm afraid we'll have to endure
a couple of intruders.

201
00:22:34,970 --> 00:22:36,733
l've just talked to Uncle Willie.

202
00:22:36,905 --> 00:22:40,568
Uncle Willie's an evil old man.
Did he invite a couple painted ladies?

203
00:22:40,742 --> 00:22:44,200
Please, Caroline. Run along, dear.

204
00:22:44,379 --> 00:22:46,074
And roll down your trousers.

205
00:22:46,248 --> 00:22:50,275
Your Uncle Willie wants us to
have a photographer and reporter...

206
00:22:50,452 --> 00:22:54,081
...from SPY magazine cover your wedding.

207
00:22:54,322 --> 00:22:58,315
ls he out of his mind?

208
00:22:58,493 --> 00:23:02,953
lntimate pictures of my wedding
in that barbershop magazine?

209
00:23:03,131 --> 00:23:04,826
He can't be serious.

210
00:23:05,000 --> 00:23:07,525
He's quite serious.
lf we don't allow them...

211
00:23:07,702 --> 00:23:11,763
...this magazine will publish a rather
unsavory article about your father.

212
00:23:11,940 --> 00:23:14,966
Good. l couldn't be happier.
lt serves him right.

213
00:23:15,143 --> 00:23:16,508
You mustn't be vindictive.

214
00:23:16,678 --> 00:23:19,738
As Uncle Willie points out,
you'll only make George suffer.

215
00:23:19,915 --> 00:23:23,112
You owe it to him to suppress
this if you possibly can.

216
00:23:23,285 --> 00:23:28,951
And l'm to be examined, undressed and
generally humiliated at 1 5 cents a copy?

217
00:23:29,124 --> 00:23:31,957
-No.
-Have some compassion, Tracy.

218
00:23:32,127 --> 00:23:36,791
But this is intolerable. The idea
of letting Father off scot-free.

219
00:23:37,466 --> 00:23:41,835
No, l won't do it. And in
our house, watching every move.

220
00:23:42,003 --> 00:23:45,734
Why, jotting down notes on how we sit
and talk and eat and move...

221
00:23:45,907 --> 00:23:48,467
...just to save Father's face, no.

222
00:23:48,643 --> 00:23:50,372
-Tracy--
-No!

223
00:23:50,545 --> 00:23:52,911
For me, please?

224
00:23:53,281 --> 00:23:56,842
Mother, l really think you're
sorry you ever let Father go.

225
00:23:57,018 --> 00:24:00,647
For George and for me, Tracy.

226
00:24:02,991 --> 00:24:07,690
Oh, all right.
l can't stand seeing you hurt.

227
00:24:08,163 --> 00:24:10,358
Thank you, dear.

228
00:24:15,470 --> 00:24:19,770
All right. Let them send their spies.

229
00:24:19,941 --> 00:24:22,239
-l'll give them a story.
-Now, Tracy.

230
00:24:22,410 --> 00:24:28,246
l'll give them a slant on Newport home
life that will stand their hair on end.

231
00:24:28,416 --> 00:24:32,750
Tracy, promise me you'll behave
like a lady in front of these creatures.

232
00:24:33,188 --> 00:24:34,678
l promise.

233
00:24:56,778 --> 00:24:59,804
Looks like the sort of place
where treaties are signed.

234
00:24:59,981 --> 00:25:01,141
Or wars declared.

235
00:25:01,316 --> 00:25:03,910
Maybe we should have gone
to the service entrance.

236
00:25:04,085 --> 00:25:06,246
Maybe this is the service entrance.

237
00:25:06,421 --> 00:25:11,085
l don't understand how the Lords ever
got talked into letting us come down here.

238
00:25:11,259 --> 00:25:12,886
lt's publicity, they love it.

239
00:25:13,061 --> 00:25:15,655
lt's a wonder they didn't roll
out the red carpet.

240
00:25:15,830 --> 00:25:20,130
-Mike, l don't like this assignment.
-Neither do l, Liz, but l like to eat.

241
00:25:23,338 --> 00:25:25,306
How do you do?
l think we're expected.

242
00:25:25,473 --> 00:25:28,567
Mike Connor and Miss lmbrie.
We're from SPY magazine.

243
00:25:28,743 --> 00:25:33,806
l'll tell Mrs. Lord you're here.
Please wait in the south parlor.

244
00:25:36,918 --> 00:25:40,820
-The south parlor.
-But of course.

245
00:25:45,126 --> 00:25:48,755
The family will be here
directly to welcome you.

246
00:25:49,431 --> 00:25:51,763
l wonder what with.

247
00:25:52,634 --> 00:25:56,092
-The south parlor.
-That's right.

248
00:25:57,172 --> 00:26:00,369
Would you have four footmen
bring me a large ashtray, please?

249
00:26:00,542 --> 00:26:05,741
Mike, be careful what you say.
We may be wired for sound.

250
00:26:05,914 --> 00:26:08,508
They couldn't pay me to
live in a joint like this.

251
00:26:08,683 --> 00:26:11,413
You know, they won't.

252
00:26:11,886 --> 00:26:14,980
l'd have more respect for this
dame if she'd throw us out.

253
00:26:15,156 --> 00:26:17,624
Don't make snap judgments.

254
00:26:17,792 --> 00:26:20,420
You were wrong about me,
remember?

255
00:26:20,829 --> 00:26:22,763
Yeah.

256
00:26:24,699 --> 00:26:26,496
Hey, Liz.

257
00:26:26,801 --> 00:26:29,292
Look at that loot that they collected.

258
00:26:29,471 --> 00:26:33,305
Wow. They must run a hockshop
on the side.

259
00:26:37,646 --> 00:26:39,739
What's the matter?

260
00:26:40,282 --> 00:26:42,307
The joint's full of spies.

261
00:26:42,484 --> 00:26:44,645
That ought to make us feel at home.

262
00:26:44,819 --> 00:26:47,310
Move over.

263
00:26:48,056 --> 00:26:50,115
Thank you.

264
00:26:50,925 --> 00:26:54,088
Look at this, Liz. All the comforts.

265
00:26:54,262 --> 00:26:59,723
Lousy with phones. South parlor,
sunroom, terrace, pool, stables. Stables?

266
00:26:59,901 --> 00:27:02,734
l always knew horses could talk.

267
00:27:04,239 --> 00:27:05,729
Mike, don't!

268
00:27:07,475 --> 00:27:10,444
-Yes?
-This is the voice of doom.

269
00:27:10,612 --> 00:27:12,512
What?

270
00:27:13,515 --> 00:27:17,246
This is to tell you your days are numbered.

271
00:27:18,286 --> 00:27:21,847
Hello? Oh, dear.

272
00:27:22,023 --> 00:27:25,117
One of the servants has been
at the sherry again.

273
00:27:25,393 --> 00:27:29,352
Look, Huckleberry, you'll get us tossed
out of here before we get a story.

274
00:27:29,531 --> 00:27:31,021
Stop worrying.

275
00:27:31,199 --> 00:27:34,225
You just watch the old master
put them through the loops.

276
00:27:34,402 --> 00:27:36,768
l'll watch, professor.

277
00:27:37,339 --> 00:27:40,172
l assume these are
the Seth Lord ancestors.

278
00:27:40,342 --> 00:27:43,436
There certainly can be no
other reason for hanging them.

279
00:27:43,878 --> 00:27:46,073
Can't say they look very bright.

280
00:27:46,247 --> 00:27:48,272
lnbreeding. Always produces idiots.

281
00:27:48,450 --> 00:27:50,918
Here. Open this.

282
00:28:00,662 --> 00:28:05,065
How do you do? l believe you're
the lady and gentleman from the press.

283
00:28:05,233 --> 00:28:06,825
l am Caroline Lord.

284
00:28:07,235 --> 00:28:12,298
Well, l'm Elizabeth lmbrie
and this is Mr. Macaulay Connor.

285
00:28:16,945 --> 00:28:19,311
l spoke French before l spoke English.

286
00:28:19,481 --> 00:28:23,815
My early childhood was spent in Paris,
where my father worked in a bank.

287
00:28:23,985 --> 00:28:25,885
The House of Morgan.

288
00:28:26,054 --> 00:28:28,921
-You don't say.
-Yes, l do say.

289
00:28:31,426 --> 00:28:34,156
Can you play the piano?
l can.

290
00:28:34,329 --> 00:28:39,357
l shall play and sing
at the same time.

291
00:29:23,912 --> 00:29:28,281
How do you do?
l'm Tracy Lord.

292
00:29:29,217 --> 00:29:33,176
You must be-- Oh, of course, you are.

293
00:29:33,354 --> 00:29:36,323
l adore strangers.

294
00:29:36,491 --> 00:29:39,551
Do sit down, please.

295
00:29:39,727 --> 00:29:40,921
That sister of yours--

296
00:29:41,095 --> 00:29:45,759
lsn't she a dear? And so talented. But
we're afraid she has a homicidal streak.

297
00:29:45,934 --> 00:29:49,233
-Did you get lost finding us?
-No. We had good directions.

298
00:29:49,404 --> 00:29:51,872
l hope you don't mind
our being here.

299
00:29:52,040 --> 00:29:54,304
Oh, but l'm delighted.
We have so much cake.

300
00:29:54,476 --> 00:29:57,377
-What is your name, dear?
-No, thank you.

301
00:29:57,545 --> 00:30:00,139
l'm so sensitive to names.

302
00:30:00,315 --> 00:30:02,840
My name is Elizabeth lmbrie.

303
00:30:03,017 --> 00:30:05,713
Elizabeth lmbrie.

304
00:30:05,887 --> 00:30:11,416
lt sounds like a medieval saint who
was burned to death. And you?

305
00:30:11,593 --> 00:30:13,151
l'm Mike Connor.

306
00:30:13,328 --> 00:30:17,765
Michael. What a lovely musical name.
Now, you mustn't be ashamed of it.

307
00:30:17,932 --> 00:30:19,524
l'm not. Mike is for Macaulay.

308
00:30:19,701 --> 00:30:22,033
And what's the Macaulay for?

309
00:30:22,203 --> 00:30:25,536
My father taught English history.
My friends call me Mike.

310
00:30:25,707 --> 00:30:28,437
Of whom you have many, l'm sure.

311
00:30:28,610 --> 00:30:31,477
English history has
always fascinated me.

312
00:30:31,646 --> 00:30:35,082
Cromwell and Robin Hood.

313
00:30:35,250 --> 00:30:37,718
And Jack the Ripper. Where did he teach?

314
00:30:37,886 --> 00:30:41,822
-Your father, l mean.
-South Bend, lndiana.

315
00:30:41,990 --> 00:30:46,120
South Bend. lt sounds
like dancing, doesn't it?

316
00:30:46,294 --> 00:30:48,762
You must have had a most
happy childhood there.

317
00:30:49,330 --> 00:30:51,093
-lt was screams.
-l'm so glad.

318
00:30:51,466 --> 00:30:53,263
-l didn't mean it that way.
-Sorry.

319
00:30:53,434 --> 00:30:55,334
lt's a natural mistake.

320
00:30:55,503 --> 00:30:58,700
-Are you the photographer or the...?
-l take pictures.

321
00:30:58,873 --> 00:31:04,004
Great art. Did you bring your Brownie?
You must be sort of a writer, Mr. Connor.

322
00:31:04,178 --> 00:31:06,305
-Sort of, yes.
-Have l read your novels?

323
00:31:06,481 --> 00:31:07,470
l doubt it.

324
00:31:07,649 --> 00:31:09,981
-l haven't written any.
-But you must.

325
00:31:10,151 --> 00:31:13,882
Why, Mozart composed at 1 3.
You must be at least 30.

326
00:31:14,055 --> 00:31:18,048
Time is flying. Where were you born,
Miss lmbrie?

327
00:31:18,226 --> 00:31:20,854
-Duluth.
-Duluth.

328
00:31:21,029 --> 00:31:23,827
-That's west of here, isn't it?
-Sort of.

329
00:31:23,998 --> 00:31:26,466
But we occasionally get
the eastern breezes.

330
00:31:26,634 --> 00:31:30,161
-Are you two going together?
-Now, look, Miss Lord.

331
00:31:30,338 --> 00:31:34,638
-That's an odd question, l must say.
-l don't see why. l think it's fascinating.

332
00:31:34,809 --> 00:31:36,606
Like birds in spring. lt's--

333
00:31:36,778 --> 00:31:41,078
Well, it's the sort of intimate detail you
like to write about, isn't it, Mr. Connor?

334
00:31:41,249 --> 00:31:44,150
But if you'd rather not have
your privacy invaded...

335
00:31:44,319 --> 00:31:47,288
...l will certainly respect your wishes.
Please.

336
00:31:47,455 --> 00:31:50,947
lf you'll excuse me, l'll see
what's keeping Mama.

337
00:31:51,125 --> 00:31:53,650
Mama is so eager to see you.

338
00:31:53,828 --> 00:31:55,420
Mama?

339
00:31:59,834 --> 00:32:02,894
You know, professor, l think you
dropped a loop.

340
00:32:04,205 --> 00:32:08,471
-She can't be for real.
-Who was doing the interviewing?

341
00:32:08,643 --> 00:32:13,637
-Do you think she was born that way?
-No. Takes years.

342
00:32:14,916 --> 00:32:17,111
l know we're being taken for a ride.

343
00:32:17,285 --> 00:32:20,186
Well, if we are, let's enjoy the scenery.

344
00:32:20,355 --> 00:32:22,289
l'm scared. l wanna go home.

345
00:32:22,457 --> 00:32:26,325
Mama. Mama, this is
Miss lmbrie of Duluth...

346
00:32:26,494 --> 00:32:30,624
...and the young man she goes with at
SPY magazine, Mr. Mike Macaulay Connor.

347
00:32:30,798 --> 00:32:33,790
-He's the son of an English teacher.
-How do you do?

348
00:32:33,968 --> 00:32:35,765
-Sorry to keep you waiting.
-Not at all.

349
00:32:35,937 --> 00:32:38,770
-We enjoyed the floor show.
-You must mean Caroline.

350
00:32:38,940 --> 00:32:43,070
-Well, then, you've met us all, haven't you?
-Except Mr. Lord.

351
00:32:44,579 --> 00:32:46,809
Look at the pretty way she does her hair.

352
00:32:46,981 --> 00:32:49,882
-lt's lovely. ls it lacquered?
-No.

353
00:32:50,051 --> 00:32:55,284
-Will Mr. Lord be here for the wedding?
-We're about to have lunch. Join us.

354
00:32:55,456 --> 00:32:58,448
-Thank you.
-Good. l'll tell Edward.

355
00:32:58,626 --> 00:33:03,256
We wondered about Mr. Lord
because l was hoping to be able to get--

356
00:33:03,431 --> 00:33:06,992
-We wondered about Mr. Lord--
-We usually have box lunches on the lawn.

357
00:33:07,168 --> 00:33:09,466
But today it's sit-down.
Come to the garden.

358
00:33:11,406 --> 00:33:14,375
-Do you like your sherry dry or sweet?
-Scotch on the rocks.

359
00:33:14,542 --> 00:33:17,773
George, Mr. Connor of SPY magazine.
He's going to cover our wedding.

360
00:33:17,945 --> 00:33:19,037
How do you do?

361
00:33:19,213 --> 00:33:22,080
-And Miss lmbrie of Duluth.
-How do you do?

362
00:33:22,250 --> 00:33:25,686
Splendid. l'm a great admirer
of your magazine, Mr. Connor.

363
00:33:25,853 --> 00:33:27,548
Really? Why?

364
00:33:27,722 --> 00:33:31,749
lt has its finger on the pulse of the public
and its ear to the ground.

365
00:33:31,926 --> 00:33:34,190
That's a vulnerable position,
don't you think?

366
00:33:34,362 --> 00:33:36,421
l asked Edward to set two extra places.

367
00:33:36,597 --> 00:33:39,361
Make it three. Hello, sweetheart!

368
00:33:39,567 --> 00:33:43,059
-Who he?
-This is Miss lmbrie and Mr. Connor...

369
00:33:43,237 --> 00:33:45,296
-...from SPY magazine.
-SPY?

370
00:33:45,473 --> 00:33:48,169
Your tastes have changed a little,
haven't they, Sam?

371
00:33:48,342 --> 00:33:50,367
-Sam?
-Her middle name's Samantha.

372
00:33:50,545 --> 00:33:52,410
-She hates it. Hi.
-Hi.

373
00:33:52,580 --> 00:33:57,381
lsn't it time for your milk
and arsenic, darling?

374
00:33:58,653 --> 00:34:02,145
Are you the same Dexter-Haven
that wrote a song called ""Samantha""?

375
00:34:02,323 --> 00:34:05,622
And unless l'm mistaken,
weren't you once married to Miss Lord?

376
00:34:05,793 --> 00:34:08,956
-Guilty on both counts.
-l remember. Two years ago.

377
00:34:09,130 --> 00:34:11,291
Elopement, headlines,
divorce, headlines...

378
00:34:11,466 --> 00:34:14,993
-...and now you're back for the wedding?
-l'm here for this jazz festival...

379
00:34:15,169 --> 00:34:17,865
...but l expect to pitch a little rice
on the side.

380
00:34:18,039 --> 00:34:20,234
Mr. Haven has become
quite famous since our divorce.

381
00:34:20,408 --> 00:34:24,902
Undoubtedly you know of his
piano concerto ""Choo Choo Mama.""

382
00:34:25,079 --> 00:34:26,808
Yes, l know it very well.

383
00:34:26,981 --> 00:34:29,279
Tell me, how did you
and Mr. Kittredge meet?

384
00:34:29,450 --> 00:34:31,418
Heaven brought them together.

385
00:34:31,586 --> 00:34:33,952
My father took me to inspect
one of his mines...

386
00:34:34,122 --> 00:34:36,352
...and Mr. Kittredge was there
to guide us.

387
00:34:36,524 --> 00:34:39,459
-How romantic.
-Yes, they met in a hole in the ground.

388
00:34:39,627 --> 00:34:43,028
We're all very friendly.
lt's the only civilized way to behave.

389
00:34:43,197 --> 00:34:47,065
Could l have a picture of the bride
between her first and second husband?

390
00:34:47,235 --> 00:34:48,896
Really, l don't-- Darling....

391
00:34:49,070 --> 00:34:50,970
ls something like this thrilling?

392
00:34:51,139 --> 00:34:53,699
May the two gentlemen
look at each other?

393
00:34:53,941 --> 00:34:56,375
You don't look as well
as the last time l saw you.

394
00:34:56,544 --> 00:34:58,011
Ready?

395
00:34:58,913 --> 00:35:03,316
You've got a lot on your mind.
But it's too late to back out, old boy.

396
00:35:03,551 --> 00:35:06,520
-They grew up together.
-Miss Lord...

397
00:35:06,687 --> 00:35:09,918
...would you look at your first husband
in this one, please?

398
00:35:14,529 --> 00:35:18,260
You don't look old enough
to marry anybody. You never did.

399
00:35:18,432 --> 00:35:19,990
Ready?

400
00:35:20,835 --> 00:35:23,429
-One more, please.
-Naturally.

401
00:35:23,604 --> 00:35:26,903
She needs trouble to mature, Kittredge.
Give her a lot of it.

402
00:35:27,074 --> 00:35:31,272
-l'm afraid she can't count on me for that.
-That's a pity. l gave her plenty.

403
00:35:31,445 --> 00:35:32,434
Ready?

404
00:35:32,613 --> 00:35:35,480
Mr. Kittredge, could you smile?
You're the groom, you know.

405
00:35:37,385 --> 00:35:39,444
-There. Thank you.
-Good.

406
00:35:39,787 --> 00:35:41,687
Miss Lord, please lift your chin.

407
00:35:42,523 --> 00:35:44,650
l thought l was sticking it out.

408
00:35:48,396 --> 00:35:52,696
Say, that's some rock you got there, Sam.
Did you mine that yourself, George?

409
00:35:53,000 --> 00:35:55,491
Father sent her a diamond necklace.

410
00:35:55,670 --> 00:35:59,436
Yes, when will l be able to get a picture
of the family united with Mr. Lord?

411
00:35:59,607 --> 00:36:04,340
-My husband loathes publicity.
-He will be here a little later, won't he?

412
00:36:06,614 --> 00:36:08,104
Papa!

413
00:36:10,451 --> 00:36:12,783
Papa. lt's Papa!

414
00:36:12,954 --> 00:36:16,754
-Oh, capital, it's Papa!
-Dear Papa, you came at last.

415
00:36:16,924 --> 00:36:19,688
Papa? Have you by any chance
slipped a cog?

416
00:36:19,861 --> 00:36:22,421
Uncle Willie, for the time being,
you have to be Father.

417
00:36:22,597 --> 00:36:25,065
-Why?
-l shall explain later.

418
00:36:25,233 --> 00:36:28,225
-Look, it's Papa!
-lt's Papa!

419
00:36:28,402 --> 00:36:30,097
-lt's Papa.
-Yes.

420
00:36:30,271 --> 00:36:32,831
Tell Edward to set another place for lunch.

421
00:36:33,007 --> 00:36:35,567
-You're looking clever today, Papa.
-Thank you.

422
00:36:35,743 --> 00:36:39,144
-Papa, this is Miss lmbrie and Mr. Connor.
-They're from SPY.

423
00:36:39,313 --> 00:36:44,012
Spy? Yes, of course, the magazine.
l believe l know your editor.

424
00:36:44,185 --> 00:36:46,915
-Dreadful fellow.
-He's wretched.

425
00:36:47,488 --> 00:36:51,356
Papa, these two charming people
were beginning to doubt your existence.

426
00:36:51,525 --> 00:36:53,152
Well, imagine that.

427
00:36:54,295 --> 00:36:56,991
Father of the bride.
We'll use it to head the article.

428
00:36:57,164 --> 00:36:58,756
l'm afraid you got my bad side.

429
00:36:58,933 --> 00:37:03,267
-l'm sure you have no bad side, Mr. Lord.
-l like her.

430
00:37:03,437 --> 00:37:05,598
Now, l'll have a drink, if l may.

431
00:37:09,410 --> 00:37:13,642
How clumsy of me. l could die.

432
00:37:13,915 --> 00:37:16,941
-l'll bet it's ruined.
-l'd like a piece of your bet.

433
00:37:17,118 --> 00:37:19,586
-ls it broken?
-Probably.

434
00:37:19,754 --> 00:37:22,086
-Whatever will you do?
-l carry a spare.

435
00:37:22,256 --> 00:37:25,191
-Luncheon is served.
-Thank you, Edward.

436
00:37:25,359 --> 00:37:28,328
Shall we go in?
We're all famished, l'm sure.

437
00:37:28,496 --> 00:37:30,123
-Bring your drinks.
-Sweetie.

438
00:37:30,298 --> 00:37:33,062
-l haven't got a drink.
-Have some schnapps, Pops.

439
00:37:33,234 --> 00:37:36,032
When you look at this wonderful family...

440
00:37:36,203 --> 00:37:38,364
...do you wonder what you've done
to deserve it?

441
00:37:38,539 --> 00:37:40,097
l do indeed, my boy.

442
00:37:40,274 --> 00:37:42,902
Every morning l look into the mirror
and l say to myself:

443
00:37:43,077 --> 00:37:46,205
""Seth Lord, what in the world
have you done to deserve this?""

444
00:37:46,380 --> 00:37:50,510
-And what have you done?
-l beg your pardon? Oh, not a thing.

445
00:37:51,485 --> 00:37:53,783
lt's a fine place you have.
Build it yourself?

446
00:37:53,955 --> 00:37:56,583
Of course. Brick by brick.

447
00:37:56,991 --> 00:37:59,152
Quite an undertaking, you know. l--

448
00:37:59,327 --> 00:38:02,922
And it would appear that each brick
is about to fall upon me.

449
00:38:03,097 --> 00:38:05,327
-Tracy, your Uncle Willie is here.
-My what?

450
00:38:05,499 --> 00:38:07,524
Aren't you gonna greet Uncle Willie?

451
00:38:09,103 --> 00:38:10,968
Uncle Willie!

452
00:38:13,107 --> 00:38:14,734
Uncle Willie!

453
00:38:15,343 --> 00:38:18,608
-Father, what are you doing here?
-l have a right to be here.

454
00:38:18,779 --> 00:38:21,714
-You're Uncle Willie, understand?
-No. l don't.

455
00:38:21,882 --> 00:38:24,407
-l'll explain later.
-Look, everybody...

456
00:38:24,685 --> 00:38:27,916
...isn't it nice of Uncle Willie
to surprise us?

457
00:38:28,089 --> 00:38:32,355
Miss lmbrie, Mr. Connor,
this is my Uncle Willie.

458
00:38:35,162 --> 00:38:39,326
Were you, by any chance,
playing footsie with me at lunch?

459
00:38:39,867 --> 00:38:41,767
From where l sat?

460
00:38:42,069 --> 00:38:44,230
l didn't think your reach was that good.

461
00:38:44,405 --> 00:38:48,205
Seth Lord has a roving eye. And foot.

462
00:38:51,312 --> 00:38:54,873
-Elegant junk.
-lt's shiny.

463
00:38:55,049 --> 00:38:59,509
Would l trade places with Miss Tracy Lord
for all her wealth and beauty?

464
00:38:59,687 --> 00:39:04,283
-Just ask me.
-All right, l will.

465
00:39:04,458 --> 00:39:08,087
Would you trade places with Miss
Tracy Lord for all of her wealth and beauty?

466
00:39:08,262 --> 00:39:11,095
You know, l can't help thinking about it.

467
00:41:35,042 --> 00:41:36,509
Cold?

468
00:41:37,878 --> 00:41:41,905
And what little mission of mischief
brings you out of the bushes?

469
00:41:42,082 --> 00:41:44,073
A wedding present.

470
00:41:44,251 --> 00:41:46,651
Wouldn't it have been simpler
to have it sent over?

471
00:41:46,820 --> 00:41:48,253
Oh, no.

472
00:41:49,256 --> 00:41:52,191
Whoever brought it could never say
what l want to say.

473
00:41:54,094 --> 00:41:55,618
Well?

474
00:41:56,964 --> 00:41:59,592
Lovely and unrelenting.

475
00:42:00,935 --> 00:42:06,271
-You said you had something to say.
-l'd hoped you'd changed a little, Tracy...

476
00:42:06,440 --> 00:42:07,998
...maybe softened some.

477
00:42:08,175 --> 00:42:11,508
Well, not for my sake entirely,
but for yours.

478
00:42:11,679 --> 00:42:15,877
-You'd stand a better chance at happiness.
-Thank you. l'll manage.

479
00:42:16,050 --> 00:42:18,848
Oh, yeah. l bet you will.
You'll manage all right.

480
00:42:19,019 --> 00:42:20,748
You'll manage George too.

481
00:42:20,921 --> 00:42:25,221
But heaven help him if he shows
any signs of weakness or rebellion.

482
00:42:25,392 --> 00:42:28,884
l see you haven't changed either, Dexter.

483
00:42:29,930 --> 00:42:31,898
l tried hard to figure it out.

484
00:42:32,066 --> 00:42:35,035
Your father hurt you deeply
when he hurt your mother.

485
00:42:35,202 --> 00:42:38,330
-Please.
-So you started demanding perfection.

486
00:42:39,406 --> 00:42:43,433
Nobody was gonna hurt you.
You felt l tricked you.

487
00:42:44,612 --> 00:42:48,378
l didn't know you wanted a husband
who'd be high priest to a virgin goddess.

488
00:42:48,549 --> 00:42:51,950
-Stop using those foul words.
-lt's a real pity too, Tracy.

489
00:42:52,119 --> 00:42:56,852
You'd be a wonderful woman
if you'd just let your tiara slip a little.

490
00:42:57,024 --> 00:43:00,585
But you'll never be a wonderful woman,
or even a wonderful human being...

491
00:43:00,761 --> 00:43:04,356
...until you learn to have
some regard for human frailty.

492
00:43:05,799 --> 00:43:08,927
There's a lot more of you goddesses
around than people realize.

493
00:43:09,203 --> 00:43:13,037
-ls that all you have to say?
-No.

494
00:43:13,207 --> 00:43:17,541
Those first weeks we spent together
were the most wonderful l've ever known.

495
00:43:17,711 --> 00:43:18,803
l want to thank you for them.

496
00:43:20,864 --> 00:43:23,526
Good luck, Sam, and good sailing.

497
00:44:34,004 --> 00:44:35,767
Hey skipper, when do we eat?

498
00:44:37,841 --> 00:44:39,536
Now.

499
00:44:39,943 --> 00:44:44,039
-Well, you've been at it long enough.
-lt's the bride's prerogative.

500
00:44:44,214 --> 00:44:46,876
l don't like you out of my sight so long.

501
00:44:47,050 --> 00:44:49,245
That's nice.

502
00:44:49,719 --> 00:44:51,949
l'll have that fixed in the morning.

503
00:44:52,122 --> 00:44:53,612
First course.

504
00:44:54,257 --> 00:44:56,384
You'll never be able to follow it.

505
00:44:57,127 --> 00:44:59,186
Second course.

506
00:45:00,630 --> 00:45:02,461
-What is it?
-Tomato juice.

507
00:45:02,632 --> 00:45:04,862
You've done something brilliant to it.
What?

508
00:45:05,035 --> 00:45:08,835
-Opened the can and poured it out.
-lt's so piquant.

509
00:45:09,840 --> 00:45:11,273
Good.

510
00:45:11,441 --> 00:45:15,605
-lnvented by the Earl of Sandwich?
-With something special added.

511
00:45:20,417 --> 00:45:22,885
-You hussy!
-You said you'd eat anything.

512
00:45:23,053 --> 00:45:24,987
lt's for you.

513
00:48:09,119 --> 00:48:10,108
Tracy?

514
00:48:11,421 --> 00:48:13,184
Tracy?

515
00:48:15,225 --> 00:48:16,658
Hey.

516
00:48:17,460 --> 00:48:18,984
You all right?

517
00:48:20,363 --> 00:48:24,800
-Yes. l-- l was just--
-l know. Half asleep.

518
00:48:24,968 --> 00:48:28,165
Say, aren't you a pretty big girl
to be playing with boats?

519
00:48:28,338 --> 00:48:32,672
lt's a model of the True Love.
A wedding present from Dexter.

520
00:48:33,576 --> 00:48:37,979
We spent our honeymoon on her.
Oh my, she was yare.

521
00:48:38,148 --> 00:48:40,673
Yare? What's yare?

522
00:48:40,850 --> 00:48:45,378
Sleek, quick to the helm,
everything a boat should be.

523
00:48:45,989 --> 00:48:49,618
lt seems hardly in good taste
as a wedding present.

524
00:48:49,793 --> 00:48:54,628
George, the true love
never really existed with Dexter.

525
00:48:54,798 --> 00:48:56,891
l want you to know that.

526
00:48:59,502 --> 00:49:01,197
l do know.

527
00:49:01,371 --> 00:49:03,965
That's the wonderful thing about you.

528
00:49:04,607 --> 00:49:07,337
You're untouched by this
foolish first marriage.

529
00:49:07,977 --> 00:49:10,878
There's a beautiful purity about you...

530
00:49:11,047 --> 00:49:14,448
...like a statue to be worshipped.

531
00:49:14,617 --> 00:49:18,018
But l don't want to be worshipped.
l want to be loved.

532
00:49:18,188 --> 00:49:22,784
That goes without saying. But l also want
you up on a pedestal where you belong.

533
00:49:22,959 --> 00:49:25,189
Where l can look up and adore you.

534
00:49:32,035 --> 00:49:33,195
Never mind.

535
00:49:36,973 --> 00:49:39,567
Tracy, aren't you going in, dear?

536
00:49:39,743 --> 00:49:43,975
-l've changed my mind.
-Mr. Lord...

537
00:49:45,615 --> 00:49:49,016
...l haven't had a chance to thank you yet
for coming back for the wedding.

538
00:49:49,185 --> 00:49:51,653
lt was very decent of you
and we both appreciate it.

539
00:49:51,821 --> 00:49:54,949
Well, thank you, George.
l felt my wife would not object.

540
00:49:55,125 --> 00:49:59,255
George, we moved your things
to make room for those magazine people.

541
00:49:59,429 --> 00:50:02,660
-You don't mind, do you?
-Anything you do is all right with me.

542
00:50:02,832 --> 00:50:05,767
We're having cocktails here
before going to Uncle Willie's.

543
00:50:05,935 --> 00:50:07,869
l'd better dash off and change.

544
00:50:08,037 --> 00:50:09,902
l'll see you later, Tracy.

545
00:50:10,073 --> 00:50:11,597
Excuse me.

546
00:50:15,678 --> 00:50:18,613
l have a feeling George
is going to take that ring tomorrow...

547
00:50:18,782 --> 00:50:21,114
...and go right through center with it.

548
00:50:22,152 --> 00:50:23,949
That's very amusing.

549
00:50:24,120 --> 00:50:27,715
Almost as amusing as the sight of you
with your arm around Mother.

550
00:50:28,224 --> 00:50:31,853
Well, l find it most unamusing
to be passed off as your Uncle Willie.

551
00:50:32,028 --> 00:50:35,691
And do take that tone out of your voice.
lt is most unattractive.

552
00:50:35,865 --> 00:50:37,890
Oh, really?

553
00:50:38,067 --> 00:50:42,561
And your dancer friend, how does she
speak to you, dulcet and intoxicating?

554
00:50:42,739 --> 00:50:46,004
Heady enough to make you
forget family responsibilities?

555
00:50:46,176 --> 00:50:49,907
-Stop it instantly!
-Mother, l can't help it. lt's sickening.

556
00:50:50,079 --> 00:50:54,277
A magnificent right he's got to come back
in his best head of the family manner...

557
00:50:54,451 --> 00:50:57,579
...and start taking charge
as if he's done nothing at all.

558
00:50:57,754 --> 00:50:59,745
Well, it's not really your affair.

559
00:50:59,923 --> 00:51:01,686
lf it concerns anyone....

560
00:51:01,858 --> 00:51:04,520
Actually, l don't know who it
concerns except your father.

561
00:51:04,694 --> 00:51:09,028
That is very wise of you, Margaret.
What most wives don't seem to realize...

562
00:51:09,199 --> 00:51:12,896
...is that a husband's philandering,
even as innocuous as my own...

563
00:51:13,069 --> 00:51:15,299
...has nothing whatever to do with them.

564
00:51:16,406 --> 00:51:19,773
And pray, just what has it
to do with, then?

565
00:51:19,943 --> 00:51:22,434
A reluctance to grow old, l think.

566
00:51:22,612 --> 00:51:26,173
l suppose the best mainstay a man can
have as he gets along in years...

567
00:51:26,349 --> 00:51:27,338
...is a daughter.

568
00:51:27,550 --> 00:51:31,418
The right kind of daughter,
one who's full of warmth and affection...

569
00:51:31,588 --> 00:51:35,354
...a kind of foolish, unquestioning,
uncritical affection.

570
00:51:35,525 --> 00:51:39,325
None of which l've got, of course.
l'm a cold goddess.

571
00:51:39,496 --> 00:51:42,954
lf your vanity thinks
in terms of goddesses.

572
00:51:43,132 --> 00:51:44,997
You have a good mind, Tracy.

573
00:51:45,168 --> 00:51:49,002
You have a pretty face, a fine,
disciplined body that does what you tell it.

574
00:51:49,172 --> 00:51:53,973
You have everything it takes to make
a lovely woman, except the one essential:

575
00:51:54,143 --> 00:51:56,236
An understanding heart.

576
00:51:56,412 --> 00:52:00,246
Without it, you might just as well
be made of bronze.

577
00:52:03,253 --> 00:52:05,721
That's an awful thing to say to anyone.

578
00:52:05,889 --> 00:52:08,949
-lt's an awful thing to have to say.
-Seth, that's too much.

579
00:52:09,125 --> 00:52:11,616
l'm afraid it isn't enough.

580
00:52:11,794 --> 00:52:14,422
Darling, your father doesn't mean that.

581
00:52:14,597 --> 00:52:17,088
Neither one of you means it.

582
00:52:17,834 --> 00:52:21,463
Both of you seem to forget
that in striking out at each other...

583
00:52:21,638 --> 00:52:24,163
...you hurt others besides yourself.

584
00:52:43,059 --> 00:52:45,926
What's the matter with everyone
all of a sudden?

585
00:53:06,516 --> 00:53:08,108
Get in.

586
00:53:26,169 --> 00:53:29,070
Are you learning anything
about the idle rich?

587
00:53:29,238 --> 00:53:31,399
Yeah, they drive too fast.

588
00:53:32,175 --> 00:53:34,040
Where we headed anyway?

589
00:53:34,210 --> 00:53:37,668
-The graveyard.
-l'm not ready.

590
00:53:37,847 --> 00:53:42,614
l thought l'd show you the playground
of the rich, the graveyard of wealth.

591
00:53:42,785 --> 00:53:44,685
Well, for that l'm ready.

592
00:53:51,861 --> 00:53:53,260
Beautiful, isn't it?

593
00:53:54,364 --> 00:53:55,661
The grass needs cutting.

594
00:53:56,132 --> 00:53:58,430
lt's been boarded up for 1 5 years.

595
00:53:58,601 --> 00:54:01,798
-Why?
-The high cost of being rich.

596
00:54:01,971 --> 00:54:05,498
Most of the homes here are closed up
or sold for taxes.

597
00:54:05,675 --> 00:54:08,075
Why don't you write about that?

598
00:54:13,383 --> 00:54:15,874
You've got a chip on your shoulder
about me. Why?

599
00:54:16,052 --> 00:54:18,748
Because you came here
with your mind already made up.

600
00:54:18,921 --> 00:54:21,788
The time to make up your mind
about people is never.

601
00:54:21,958 --> 00:54:24,654
-l had an opinion.
-Unfavorable and unfair.

602
00:54:24,827 --> 00:54:29,025
Really? What exactly do you do
around here that's so worthwhile?

603
00:54:29,198 --> 00:54:31,996
Do you consider what you do worthwhile?

604
00:54:32,168 --> 00:54:35,535
Making a living off people's
personal lives and misfortunes?

605
00:54:35,705 --> 00:54:39,038
-l cannot pick and choose.
-You could be anything you wanted to be.

606
00:54:39,208 --> 00:54:42,644
But you'll never be a first-class writer
or human being...

607
00:54:42,812 --> 00:54:47,408
...until you learn to have some
compassion or regard for human....

608
00:54:47,583 --> 00:54:50,074
-You were saying?
-Nothing.

609
00:54:50,353 --> 00:54:53,345
This is the second time you've
taken me for a ride. l don't like it.

610
00:54:53,523 --> 00:54:56,788
-Really?
-Really, Miss Tracy Samantha.

611
00:54:56,959 --> 00:55:01,157
Samantha. What a lovely, musical name.

612
00:55:01,364 --> 00:55:04,197
Reminds me of an lndian cure
for snakebite.

613
00:55:04,367 --> 00:55:10,237
-What's it stand for? The name, l mean.
-lt stands for no nonsense.

614
00:55:10,640 --> 00:55:12,733
What do you do beside collect husbands?

615
00:55:12,909 --> 00:55:17,175
-l mind my own business.
-This happens to be my business.

616
00:55:17,346 --> 00:55:21,680
For instance, how old are you,
Miss Lord? 26?

617
00:55:21,851 --> 00:55:23,512
No children?

618
00:55:23,853 --> 00:55:27,755
Time is flying.
What do you do in your spare time?

619
00:55:27,924 --> 00:55:31,655
l sometimes endure arrogant reporters.

620
00:55:31,828 --> 00:55:33,796
Arrogant, indeed.

621
00:55:33,963 --> 00:55:36,261
Shall we keep this
on an impersonal basis?

622
00:55:36,432 --> 00:55:40,562
-Shall we continue with the full tour?
-Gladly, Miss Lord.

623
00:55:40,737 --> 00:55:43,001
But without the full treatment.
