- Dr. Donne?
- Please come in, Miss Bowman.

23
00:02:57,135 --> 00:02:59,513
- Mr. Donne's expecting you.
- (SOFTLY) Thank you.

David?

26
00:03:15,070 --> 00:03:16,287
Hello, Jenny.

27
00:03:17,114 --> 00:03:18,957
Is this awfully inconvenient?

28
00:03:19,658 --> 00:03:20,875
I don't think so.

29
00:03:20,951 --> 00:03:21,952
Come on up.

30
00:03:29,543 --> 00:03:30,760
I'll take your coat.

DAVID: That's for social calls.

32
00:03:46,268 --> 00:03:48,862
Well, you did say this was business,
didn't you?

33
00:03:49,688 --> 00:03:51,816
Yes, Doctor. Business.

34
00:03:52,274 --> 00:03:54,493
Well, the business department is in here.

35
00:04:02,033 --> 00:04:04,582
Why do they call you "mister"
if you're a doctor?

36
00:04:04,661 --> 00:04:07,335
- Surgeons are called "mister."
- I see.

37
00:04:07,789 --> 00:04:10,633
You mean, like a marquis
being called a "lord."

38
00:04:10,667 --> 00:04:13,011
That always mixes me up, too.

39
00:04:13,044 --> 00:04:14,341
Secrets of the trade.

40
00:04:14,379 --> 00:04:15,926
Would you sit down?

41
00:04:16,006 --> 00:04:18,259
- Yes, thank you.
- Now then, what is it?

42
00:04:19,176 --> 00:04:20,769
Ear, nose or throat?

43
00:04:22,137 --> 00:04:24,515
Do you take care
of all three of those things?

44
00:04:24,556 --> 00:04:25,682
Yes.

45
00:04:27,726 --> 00:04:28,727
Which is it?

46
00:04:30,979 --> 00:04:32,947
Were you surprised to hear from me?

47
00:04:33,231 --> 00:04:34,448
A little.

48
00:04:35,233 --> 00:04:37,782
You sang this afternoon.
Charity concert, wasn't it?

49
00:04:38,528 --> 00:04:40,405
Yes. How did you know?

50
00:04:41,114 --> 00:04:42,582
It was in all the papers.

51
00:04:43,784 --> 00:04:44,876
How did it go?

52
00:04:44,910 --> 00:04:46,162
Oh, it was ghastly.

53
00:04:46,203 --> 00:04:48,643
- That means it was good.
- No, it was terrible. It was awful.

54
00:04:48,705 --> 00:04:51,299
My throat was very raw and I couldn't...

55
00:04:51,750 --> 00:04:55,004
I... I just sort of croaked out
the performance.

56
00:04:55,045 --> 00:04:57,764
Tell me, am I keeping
this secretary person of yours?

57
00:04:57,839 --> 00:04:59,637
No, no. She works here.

58
00:04:59,716 --> 00:05:02,560
I know, but it's terribly late
and it's Sunday, and I thought...

59
00:05:02,594 --> 00:05:03,720
She's used to it.

60
00:05:06,223 --> 00:05:07,224
Will you go on?

61
00:05:07,849 --> 00:05:09,066
Well, I just...

62
00:05:10,227 --> 00:05:13,857
I just got scared
I was going to lose my voice.

63
00:05:14,439 --> 00:05:15,907
Mmm-hmm. Since when?

64
00:05:17,984 --> 00:05:19,110
Since when, what?

65
00:05:21,988 --> 00:05:24,616
Since when were you soared
that you were losing your voice?

66
00:05:25,325 --> 00:05:26,326
Oh, um...

67
00:05:27,410 --> 00:05:29,412
Well, since I got to England.

68
00:05:29,454 --> 00:05:33,834
And don't tell me it's the climate
because Tebaldi and Callas sing here

69
00:05:33,917 --> 00:05:35,089
and they do very well.

70
00:05:35,544 --> 00:05:37,012
Should we take a look?

71
00:05:37,087 --> 00:05:38,088
All right.

72
00:05:38,129 --> 00:05:39,847
Would you come over here, please?

73
00:05:40,215 --> 00:05:41,262
Yes.

74
00:05:41,299 --> 00:05:42,596
DAVID: Sit down.

75
00:05:44,094 --> 00:05:45,391
How are your sinuses?

76
00:05:46,221 --> 00:05:49,316
- Oh, I don't know. They're kind of...
- DAVID: Any cold recently?

77
00:05:50,851 --> 00:05:52,945
- No.
- You used to have a lot of colds.

78
00:05:54,437 --> 00:05:57,111
Yes, but then they invented
paper handkerchiefs

79
00:05:57,190 --> 00:05:59,488
and sort of took the fun out of it.

80
00:06:00,193 --> 00:06:02,161
Would you, um, open your mouth, please?

81
00:06:03,405 --> 00:06:04,406
Wide.

82
00:06:06,157 --> 00:06:07,158
Thank you.

83
00:06:08,451 --> 00:06:10,078
- Say, "Aah".
- Aah.

84
00:06:11,955 --> 00:06:12,956
Thank you.

85
00:06:13,790 --> 00:06:15,884
Now I'm going to have a look
at your larynx.

86
00:06:15,959 --> 00:06:17,812
- I'm going to take this piece of gauze...
- Gauze...

87
00:06:17,836 --> 00:06:21,090
And you're going to hold my tongue with it,
and you want me to relax

88
00:06:21,131 --> 00:06:24,635
and breathe slowly in and out
and completely...

89
00:06:24,718 --> 00:06:26,265
- Would you just do it?
- Yes, I will.

90
00:06:26,303 --> 00:06:28,397
Thank you. Would you put out your tongue?

91
00:06:34,102 --> 00:06:35,479
Yes, thank you.

92
00:06:37,314 --> 00:06:38,691
You know, I've been thinking...

93
00:06:38,773 --> 00:06:41,276
Would you just sit there, please,
for a moment?

94
00:06:44,654 --> 00:06:46,156
Would you come back?

95
00:06:46,698 --> 00:06:47,699
All right.

96
00:06:48,033 --> 00:06:49,159
Excuse me.

97
00:06:56,458 --> 00:06:58,677
I've been thinking about Atlantic City.

98
00:07:00,337 --> 00:07:02,681
Do you ever think about
Atlantic City, David?

99
00:07:03,340 --> 00:07:04,592
Yes, I have done.

100
00:07:06,259 --> 00:07:07,476
Does this hurt?

101
00:07:08,178 --> 00:07:09,600
Mmm-mmm.

102
00:07:10,847 --> 00:07:12,099
Would you swallow?

103
00:07:18,521 --> 00:07:19,693
Thank you.

00:07:29,532 --> 00:07:32,081
Well, am I going to lose my voice or what?

00:07:33,453 --> 00:07:34,625
What do you think?

107
00:07:34,704 --> 00:07:37,048
You mean, there's nothing wrong with me?

108
00:07:37,123 --> 00:07:38,625
Your throat's a bit rough, it's red.

109
00:07:38,708 --> 00:07:40,788
You've been singing
and you've been smoking too much.

110
00:07:41,294 --> 00:07:42,921
When do you open in London?

111
00:07:43,505 --> 00:07:44,506
Five days.

112
00:07:46,216 --> 00:07:48,310
Do you mind if I get out of...

113
00:07:48,385 --> 00:07:50,228
No, I'm very sorry, no, of course, do.

114
00:07:50,929 --> 00:07:54,229
I'll give you something to ease
the roughness, not that you'll take it.

115
00:07:54,265 --> 00:07:55,983
But if you have got five days,

116
00:07:56,059 --> 00:07:58,528
I strongly urge you to take
three of them off.

A, um, brisk walk through Hyde Park?

Where can I buy those?

- And to gargle night and morning.
- Mmm-hmm.

All right.

Well, uh, why don't you
get me off on the right foot

by offering me a drink.

Yes, Janet.

- I read about your marriage.
- Which one?

144

Well, it doesn't make any difference

145

was worth writing home about.

I should have married you, David.
I really should have.

147

And it would have worked.

- Yes, it would.
- No, you're wrong, Jenny.

- Mmm-hmm. It's better as it is.

Tell me something, do you still play
that awful harmonica thing?

- No.
- Oh?

00:10:45,603 --> 00:10:47,355
Tell you the truth, I don't know.

167
00:10:48,273 --> 00:10:49,946
Maybe it's just that I...

168
00:10:51,067 --> 00:10:55,493
Didn't want to be alone on the first night
in a strange town.

169
00:10:55,572 --> 00:10:58,291
You have a mess of friends in town,
you couldn't be alone.

170
00:10:59,075 --> 00:11:00,076
Alone.

171
00:11:01,077 --> 00:11:02,579
That's the most awful word.

172
00:11:03,705 --> 00:11:05,298
And I know what it means.

173
00:11:07,417 --> 00:11:09,545
Because I've been alone since you, David.

174
00:11:12,964 --> 00:11:14,557
You've been married twice.

175
00:11:17,635 --> 00:11:19,478
Well, I was alone then, too.

176
00:11:19,596 --> 00:11:22,816
Tell me, is this when you were knighted?

177
00:11:22,891 --> 00:11:24,734
The CBE or the...

178
00:11:25,101 --> 00:11:26,273
- OBE.
- OBE.

179
00:11:27,437 --> 00:11:29,155
Mmm-hmm. That good, isn't it?

180
00:11:29,939 --> 00:11:31,282
Not quite, I'm afraid.

181
00:11:33,860 --> 00:11:34,952
It's something.

182
00:11:36,237 --> 00:11:37,489
Yes, it's something.

183
00:11:42,535 --> 00:11:44,054
- Why did you hide him from me?
- I didn't hide him.

184
00:11:44,078 --> 00:11:45,079
I saw you.

185
00:11:47,665 --> 00:11:49,008
All right, I hid him.

186
00:11:50,543 --> 00:11:51,590
Excuse me, Mr. Donne.

187
00:11:51,628 --> 00:11:53,063
Do you require me for anything else?

188
00:11:53,087 --> 00:11:56,136
Ah, no, thank you, Miss Plimpton.
I'll see Miss Bowman out.

189
00:11:56,216 --> 00:11:57,217
Good night, Miss Bowman.

190
00:11:57,759 --> 00:11:58,885
Good night.

191
00:12:02,347 --> 00:12:03,599
Is he here?

192
00:12:03,640 --> 00:12:05,438
No, he's at school. He boards.

193
00:12:07,977 --> 00:12:10,150
- I'd love to see him.
- I know.

194
00:12:12,315 --> 00:12:13,737
Oh, David, please!

195
00:12:14,734 --> 00:12:17,237
I didn't come here to ask that.
I swear, I...

196
00:12:17,820 --> 00:12:19,493
I came here to see you. I...

197
00:12:19,989 --> 00:12:20,990
I admit that.

198
00:12:21,991 --> 00:12:23,993
It's just that now that I am here, I...

199
00:12:24,035 --> 00:12:25,582
I must ask you. Please.

200
00:12:25,662 --> 00:12:27,380
I'm sorry, Jenny, you can't see him.

201
00:12:27,455 --> 00:12:28,923
Well, why not?

202
00:12:28,998 --> 00:12:30,017
What's the matter with me?

203
00:12:30,041 --> 00:12:33,341
Have I some dread disease
or some kind of...

204
00:12:33,378 --> 00:12:34,675
What are you so afraid of?

205
00:12:34,712 --> 00:12:36,815
- What is it, David? I wanna see him.
- It's impossible.

206
00:12:36,839 --> 00:12:39,193
Well, "impossible" isn't a word that
very many people use with me.

207
00:12:39,217 --> 00:12:40,611
It must come as rather
a surprise to you now, then.

208
00:12:40,635 --> 00:12:41,636
I want to see him.

209
00:12:42,011 --> 00:12:43,513
You cannot see him, Jenny.

210
00:12:44,305 --> 00:12:46,478
We made an agreement a long time ago.

211
00:12:46,516 --> 00:12:47,813
An agreement that you wanted.

212
00:12:47,976 --> 00:12:50,195
Never to see him ever again,
do you remember?

213
00:12:51,729 --> 00:12:53,026
Yes, I remember.

214
00:12:55,525 --> 00:12:56,902
It was a long time ago.

215
00:12:58,736 --> 00:13:01,205
It was the only good thing
lever made in my life.

216
00:13:02,532 --> 00:13:03,624
Now I can't...

217
00:13:03,700 --> 00:13:04,952
Oh, forget it!

218
00:13:05,034 --> 00:13:06,877
Tell me, does he like school?

219
00:13:06,911 --> 00:13:08,959
I mean, any more than anyone does?

220
00:13:09,038 --> 00:13:10,039
Yes, he...

221
00:13:11,457 --> 00:13:13,050
He likes it very much.

222
00:13:13,376 --> 00:13:14,502
Is he clever?

223
00:13:15,378 --> 00:13:16,550
He's average.

224
00:13:17,588 --> 00:13:19,135
Better at Mozart than maths.

225
00:13:20,258 --> 00:13:21,510
And musical?

226
00:13:22,802 --> 00:13:24,054
A little odd if not.

227
00:13:25,596 --> 00:13:26,597
Yes.

228
00:13:28,141 --> 00:13:29,393
And the rest?

229
00:13:31,102 --> 00:13:32,274
Well, he is...

230
00:13:33,438 --> 00:13:36,157
He's really pretty good.
I think you'd be proud of him.

231
00:13:36,566 --> 00:13:38,159
- Let me see him.
- No.

232
00:13:38,234 --> 00:13:40,111
- Just once.
- And then what?

233
00:13:40,236 --> 00:13:42,284
Nothing. I go.

234
00:13:43,573 --> 00:13:46,452
Look, Jenny, to see him now
would make it much harder for you,

235
00:13:46,534 --> 00:13:48,332
for me, for all of us.

236
00:13:50,580 --> 00:13:51,797
And that's final?

237
00:13:52,415 --> 00:13:53,416
Final.

238
00:13:53,624 --> 00:13:56,423
Well, I think I've taken up
enough of your time, David.

239
00:13:56,461 --> 00:13:57,730
And I'd like to get out of here.

240

- It's outside. I'll call you a cab.

- No, thank you, I'd rather walk.
- It won't take a moment.

No, thank you, I'd rather walk.

243

Don't bother to see me out.
I'll take care of myself.

00:44:12,567 --> 00:44:15,241
- I don't want to rush you.
- No, it's no rush.

799
00:44:20,324 --> 00:44:22,497
Can I have your autograph, please,
Miss Bowman?

800
00:44:25,288 --> 00:44:26,505
- There you are.
- Thank you.

801
00:44:26,581 --> 00:44:28,254
Thank you. Matt.

802
00:44:29,250 --> 00:44:30,968
Why do we have to get off here?

803
00:44:31,043 --> 00:44:32,886
Why don't we have the whole day together?

804
00:44:32,920 --> 00:44:35,014
- Oh, I couldn't.
- Yes, you could.

805
00:44:35,089 --> 00:44:36,636
Stay with me. Spend the day with me.

806
00:44:36,716 --> 00:44:38,434
Do me a favor, come on.

807
00:44:38,467 --> 00:44:40,515
Well, there's a 6:56,
but I'd have to let them know.

808
00:44:40,595 --> 00:44:42,573
- Well, I fixed it last night, didn't I?
- You did.

809
00:44:42,597 --> 00:44:44,099
Well, I'll fix it again tonight.

810
00:44:44,182 --> 00:44:45,855
- Corne on!
- All right.

Ah, that was a nice day.

815
00:45:22,136 --> 00:45:23,934
Don't panic, Ida, we're here.

816
00:45:24,222 --> 00:45:26,316
- We've been all the way up the river...
- Down.

817
00:45:26,390 --> 00:45:28,188
- And all the way down the Strand.
- Up.

Well, you got messages.

820

Oh, rehearsal's at 3:00.

821
00:45:34,023 --> 00:45:37,368
Phone calls, your agents,
New York, George several times,

822
00:45:37,443 --> 00:45:38,569
and they left the hats.

823
00:45:38,653 --> 00:45:40,747
Oh, good, you can help me pick one out.

824
00:45:40,821 --> 00:45:42,118
I made that call to Canterbury,

825
00:45:42,156 --> 00:45:44,500
but I don't see how he's
going to make the 6:56.

826
00:45:44,533 --> 00:45:46,080
Oh, I've got news for you, Ida.

827
00:45:46,160 --> 00:45:49,084
Matt's gonna be my guest for
one more night and one more morning.

828
00:45:50,039 --> 00:45:53,259
We're going to the ionic propulsion
exhibition at the science museum.

829
00:45:53,668 --> 00:45:56,512
So, it looks like you're gonna
have to make another call.

830
00:45:57,088 --> 00:46:00,183
Look, why don't you go powder
your nose or something, hmm?

831
00:46:01,509 --> 00:46:02,510
Okay.

832
00:46:06,347 --> 00:46:09,021
Canterbury wasn't any too happy
when I called this afternoon.

833
00:46:09,141 --> 00:46:12,566
In fact, Canterbury is getting
just a little irritated with us.

834
00:46:12,645 --> 00:46:14,739
Well, I'm sure you took
care of everything, Ida.

835
00:46:15,231 --> 00:46:16,778
You think this is my style?

836
00:46:17,191 --> 00:46:18,568
How long is this going on?

837
00:46:20,569 --> 00:46:23,072
- What do you mean?
- You know what I mean.

838
00:46:23,864 --> 00:46:26,037
Look, I took him out for the day.

839
00:46:26,075 --> 00:46:27,418
What's so wrong with that?

840
00:46:27,493 --> 00:46:30,872
Jenny, this is me, see,
Ida, 18 years, remember?

841
00:46:31,622 --> 00:46:34,626
- I just want to get to know him a little bit.
- And then what?

842
00:46:34,709 --> 00:46:36,302
Let him go home, Jenny.

843
00:46:37,378 --> 00:46:38,379
Tomorrow.

844
00:46:38,921 --> 00:46:40,764
Why don't you quit while you're ahead?

845
00:46:40,840 --> 00:46:43,719
You wanted to see him, fine, you saw him,
now, say goodbye.

846

GEORGE: Well, we blew the recording room.

847
00:46:45,469 --> 00:46:47,346
Oh, George, hi.

848
00:46:47,722 --> 00:46:48,939
When did you get back?

849
00:46:49,015 --> 00:46:50,935
- Are you all right? We were worried.
- I'm fine.

850
00:46:50,975 --> 00:46:53,228
Well, look, if you ever get hung up again,
let us know.

851
00:46:53,311 --> 00:46:56,360
We'd work it out for you,
that's what we're here for, darling.

852
00:46:56,647 --> 00:46:57,944
You still here?

853
00:46:58,024 --> 00:46:59,116
Good evening, sir.

854
00:46:59,191 --> 00:47:00,238
Yeah.

855
00:47:00,318 --> 00:47:02,286
Well, I'll set it up again.
Are we on our way?

856
00:47:03,237 --> 00:47:04,705
Are you ready, honey?

857
00:47:05,072 --> 00:47:07,791
Jenny, I... I don't think
I ought to stay. I'm...

858
00:47:08,284 --> 00:47:10,412
I'm keeping you from important things.

859
00:47:11,746 --> 00:47:13,669
Nothing's that important, Matt.

860
00:47:13,748 --> 00:47:15,216
I haven't missed a thing.

861
00:47:15,750 --> 00:47:18,879
George, I have a new escort tonight.

862
00:47:18,961 --> 00:47:20,963
And a very attractive one, too.

863
00:47:21,047 --> 00:47:22,549

00:56:59,416 --> 00:57:01,544
"Now, she's at rest, and so am l."

958
00:57:01,627 --> 00:57:03,470
- (LAUGHING)
- That's terrible!

959
00:57:03,503 --> 00:57:05,130
You're a terrible boy.

960
00:57:05,172 --> 00:57:07,300
- (When I die, I think I'll be cremated.
{CHUCKUNG)

961
00:57:07,341 --> 00:57:09,652
- Would you like to be cremated?
- I don't know. I suppose so.

962
00:57:09,676 --> 00:57:12,099
It's very sanitary and sort of chic.
I guess so.

963
00:57:12,179 --> 00:57:13,806
Well, my mother was cremated.

964
00:57:15,015 --> 00:57:16,767
- Your mother?
- Janet.

965
00:57:16,850 --> 00:57:18,727
But she's not my real mother.

966
00:57:20,228 --> 00:57:22,697
- She must have loved you very much.
- She liked me.

967
00:57:24,775 --> 00:57:27,449
Come on, let's sit down for a second,
shall we?

968
00:57:29,821 --> 00:57:32,370
Don't you ever wonder about your mother?
Your real mother?

969
00:57:32,449 --> 00:57:33,575
Not really.

970
00:57:34,034 --> 00:57:37,038
I mean, who she was and...

971
00:57:38,038 --> 00:57:39,039
No.

972
00:57:40,207 --> 00:57:41,675
I'll miss you, Jenny.

973
00:57:43,710 --> 00:57:44,711
Will you?

974
00:57:45,462 --> 00:57:46,463
Yes.

975
00:57:48,215 --> 00:57:52,265
Matt, I'm going to go
to Paris in a few days,

976
00:57:52,344 --> 00:57:55,848
and I wish you could come with me,
just... Just for a little while.

977
00:57:56,473 --> 00:58:00,228
I'll... I'll talk to your father about it
and I'll make all the arrangements.

978
00:58:00,811 --> 00:58:02,609
All you have to do is say yes.

979
00:58:04,189 --> 00:58:07,033
Jenny, I don't understand
why you're being so kind to me.

980
00:58:10,237 --> 00:58:13,912
Well, maybe it's because
I've never had a son of my own

981
00:58:13,991 --> 00:58:16,494
and I like to pretend.

982
00:58:16,910 --> 00:58:18,207
And you fit the bill.

983
00:58:18,245 --> 00:58:19,462
Will you help me?

984
00:58:20,580 --> 00:58:21,581
Yes, Jenny.

985
00:58:22,582 --> 00:58:24,129
Good man, good.

986
00:58:42,436 --> 00:58:44,905
(INDISTINCT ANNOUNCEMENT OVER PA)

987
00:59:01,455 --> 00:59:03,128
- I thought you'd got lost.
- No.

988
00:59:03,165 --> 00:59:04,633
Miss Bowman's here.

989
00:59:05,417 --> 00:59:06,464
Oh, is she?

990
00:59:06,543 --> 00:59:09,797
She said she wanted to talk to you
urgently as soon as you were back.

991
00:59:09,880 --> 00:59:11,803
Then she decided to come here
and meet you.

992
00:59:11,882 --> 00:59:14,010
- Where is she?
- She's in her car, over there.

993
00:59:15,302 --> 00:59:18,772
I didn't know what you wanted to do,
so I brought your car as arranged.

994
00:59:19,431 --> 00:59:21,399
- Is she still at the Savoy?
- Yes.

995
00:59:22,559 --> 00:59:24,399
Well, look, take my car back to town,
will you?

996
00:59:24,811 --> 00:59:27,373
Take it to the hotel, leave the keys
with the porter and take those along.

997
00:59:27,397 --> 00:59:28,649
Yes, of course.

998
00:59:28,690 --> 00:59:30,442
I'll be back as soon as I can.

999
00:59:41,119 --> 00:59:42,871
- How was your trip?
- Fine.

1000
00:59:46,875 --> 00:59:49,503
- You were in... In Rome, weren't you?
- That's right, yes.

1001
00:59:54,299 --> 00:59:56,301
Must've been an opera singer.

1002
00:59:57,719 --> 01:00:00,188
They're very delicate creatures,
opera singers.

1003
01:00:04,976 --> 01:00:08,480
- David, I have a confession to make.
- Really?

1004
01:00:10,982 --> 01:00:13,002
Yes, I'm afraid I've done something
that I shouldn't have.

1005
01:00:13,026 --> 01:00:14,494
Yes, I know that.

1006
01:00:15,779 --> 01:00:18,874
- You know'?
- News travels, Jenny. Even to Rome.

1007
01:00:24,955 --> 01:00:26,548
Are you terribly angry?

1008
01:00:28,125 --> 01:00:31,379
I'm so sick with anger
that I can hardly speak to you.

1009
01:00:36,716 --> 01:00:38,718
I don't know what to say, I...

1010
01:00:39,553 --> 01:00:42,056
I haven't got any excuses
except that it was wonderful being...

1011
01:00:42,097 --> 01:00:44,566
There's only one thing
I want to know from you.

1012
01:00:45,183 --> 01:00:47,402
How far have you broken your promise?

1013
01:00:49,229 --> 01:00:51,323
I haven't said anything, I swear.

1014
01:00:53,525 --> 01:00:55,823
I know you're angry,
but I haven't done any harm.

1015
01:00:55,902 --> 01:00:57,825
That remains to be seen, doesn't it?

1016
01:01:02,450 --> 01:01:05,596
Well, if I'm such a shady character, why
did you let me see him in the first place?

1017
01:01:05,620 --> 01:01:08,266
Have you forgotten how you begged,
how you implored, how you pleaded...

1018
01:01:08,290 --> 01:01:10,418
I don't beg. I don't beg.

1019
01:01:10,458 --> 01:01:11,960
You don't beg.

1020
01:01:12,919 --> 01:01:14,592
You just damn well assume.

1021
01:01:15,338 --> 01:01:17,215
Everything you want, you get.

1022
01:01:17,799 --> 01:01:19,597
- David...
- You haven't changed.

1023
01:01:19,676 --> 01:01:21,053
You never will.

1024
01:01:22,137 --> 01:01:26,108
You're nothing but a self-centered,
grasping, egocentric little bitch.

1025
01:01:27,684 --> 01:01:28,981
And you're a cheat.

1026
01:01:43,283 --> 01:01:47,538
Before you go in there and start to act
like the heavy father...

1027
01:01:48,663 --> 01:01:51,416
It wasn't his fault.
I brought this about myself.

1028
01:01:52,042 --> 01:01:53,385
Will you remember that?

1029
01:01:55,837 --> 01:01:58,636
Ida, would you get Matt for me, please?

1030
01:02:14,147 --> 01:02:15,490
Hello, Father.

1031
01:02:15,523 --> 01:02:17,491
I wanted to come down to the airport
with Jenny,

1032
01:02:17,525 --> 01:02:18,902
but she said better not.

1033
01:02:18,985 --> 01:02:20,745
She said that she'd explain
about everything.

1034
01:02:20,820 --> 01:02:22,663
- About Paris and all that.
- Matt...

1035
01:02:24,241 --> 01:02:25,333
We didn't win.

1036
01:02:27,786 --> 01:02:28,787
Oh.

1037
01:02:29,120 --> 01:02:31,339
Jenny explained everything perfectly, Matt.

1038
01:02:31,373 --> 01:02:34,093
All I want you to do now is to pack up
and come along. Are you ready?

1039
01:02:34,960 --> 01:02:36,553
No. No, I'm not quite packed.

1040
01:02:36,628 --> 01:02:38,105
Nothing much. That won't take long...

1041
01:02:38,129 --> 01:02:40,427
Well, you hurry up then, the car's outside.

1042
01:02:40,507 --> 01:02:42,009
- Yes, sir.
- All right.

1043
01:02:46,888 --> 01:02:48,390
So, now it's Paris, is it?

1044
01:02:49,015 --> 01:02:50,858
And then the rest of the tour.
Rome, Athens...

1045
01:02:50,934 --> 01:02:52,811
Oh, for God's sake, don't sulk.

1046
01:02:53,520 --> 01:02:55,488
You saw his face,
you saw how sorry he was.

1047
01:02:55,522 --> 01:02:56,990
And you know how sorry I am.

1048
01:02:57,023 --> 01:02:58,741
What do you want us both to do, just die?

1049
01:02:58,817 --> 01:03:00,160
I don't want you to do anything.

1050
01:03:00,193 --> 01:03:02,195
I just want to get out of here
as soon as possible.

1051
01:03:02,237 --> 01:03:03,957
Well, what was so terrible about it anyway?

1052
01:03:04,030 --> 01:03:07,455
He came to see the show, we took a trip
up the river and we had a good time.

1053
01:03:07,534 --> 01:03:10,037
What's so terrible about that?
We had a wonderful time.

1054
01:03:10,078 --> 01:03:12,723
And you're standing there as if
I'm some kind of criminal or something,

1055
01:03:12,747 --> 01:03:14,044
like I'm Lizzie Borden.

1056
01:03:14,124 --> 01:03:16,547
- Oh, for God's sake, Jenny...
- Oh, for God's sake, Jenny!

1057
01:03:16,668 --> 01:03:19,046
I stayed out of the way as long
as your wife was around.

1058
01:03:19,129 --> 01:03:21,052
And she was good for him.

1059
01:03:21,798 --> 01:03:22,924
Well, fine.

1060
01:03:23,633 --> 01:03:24,850
But what now?

1061
01:03:25,468 --> 01:03:27,391
You with your grave demeanor,

1062
01:03:27,470 --> 01:03:30,690
or your Auntie Beth in Canterbury
who's 40 years too late!

1063
01:03:30,724 --> 01:03:32,852
What kind of life are you offering him?

1064
01:03:32,892 --> 01:03:34,161
What you fail you to realize, Jenny,

1065
01:03:34,185 --> 01:03:37,029
is that we have a very good relationship,
Matt and I.

1066
01:03:37,105 --> 01:03:38,982
We were doing very well
before you came along,

1067
01:03:39,065 --> 01:03:41,193
and we'll do a damn sight better
after you've gone.

1068
01:03:42,569 --> 01:03:44,446
Boy, you know where to hit, don't you?

1069
01:03:45,447 --> 01:03:47,370
Well, I want to tell you something.

1070
01:03:48,950 --> 01:03:50,167
He needs me.

1071
01:03:50,243 --> 01:03:51,244
And I want him!

1072
01:03:51,286 --> 01:03:53,254
He's not yours to have.

1073
01:03:54,080 --> 01:03:56,833
You gave him back to me a long time ago.

1074
01:03:56,916 --> 01:03:58,644
I need him, I love him,
and I'm going to keep him.

1075
01:03:58,668 --> 01:04:00,396
You need him and I want him
and you want him and I...

1076
01:04:00,420 --> 01:04:03,219
He's not a bone, my God, he's a child!

1077
01:04:04,382 --> 01:04:05,634
He's my son.

1078
01:04:06,843 --> 01:04:08,937
And I'm going to keep him.

1079
01:04:12,140 --> 01:04:15,610
There's just one thing
we seem to both have forgotten.

1080
01:04:17,812 --> 01:04:19,234
He's my son, too.

1081
01:04:21,274 --> 01:04:22,651
I made him.

1082
01:04:24,652 --> 01:04:26,370
Now, where do we go from there?

1083
01:04:35,538 --> 01:04:36,539
I packed.

1084
01:04:37,957 --> 01:04:40,176
There's some other things
in the bedroom, but...

1085
01:04:42,170 --> 01:04:43,888
We'll send for those later, Matt.

1086
01:04:44,464 --> 01:04:45,465
Yes.

1087
01:04:48,802 --> 01:04:50,395
Can I have the tape recorder?

1088
01:04:51,137 --> 01:04:52,480
It was a present.

1089
01:04:58,144 --> 01:04:59,487
Is it true?

1090
01:05:02,065 --> 01:05:03,157
Yes.

1091
01:05:04,484 --> 01:05:05,906
MATT: Why didn't you tell me?

1092
01:05:09,322 --> 01:05:11,074
I... I meant to, uh...

1093
01:05:12,492 --> 01:05:14,665
I kept putting it off, I'm afraid.

1094
01:05:16,454 --> 01:05:17,455
But...

1095
01:05:19,040 --> 01:05:20,462
Why didn't you tell me?

1096
01:05:23,962 --> 01:05:25,930
I made a promise to your father.

1097
01:05:26,673 --> 01:05:28,596
Matt, I think we better be
moving along now.

1098
01:05:28,967 --> 01:05:30,014
No.

1099
01:05:30,844 --> 01:05:33,097
No, I don't want to go just yet, Father.

1100
01:05:33,555 --> 01:05:34,602
Not yet.

1101
01:05:36,099 --> 01:05:37,851
I'd like to stay here for a bit with you

1102
01:05:39,352 --> 01:05:40,695
and get it clearer.

1103
01:05:41,187 --> 01:05:42,689
If you have no objections.

1104
01:05:44,774 --> 01:05:46,697
No, I have no objections.

1105
01:05:48,194 --> 01:05:49,286
Please stay.

1106
01:05:49,988 --> 01:05:54,710
Matt, I've never ordered you to do
anything in your whole life, have I?

1107
01:05:56,578 --> 01:05:58,922
But I am asking you now
to come home with me.

1108
01:05:59,956 --> 01:06:00,957
Will you?

1109
01:06:04,794 --> 01:06:05,841
All right.

1110
01:06:07,881 --> 01:06:09,633
Jenny, please.

1111
01:06:10,383 --> 01:06:11,384
Yes, Matt.

1112
01:06:12,760 --> 01:06:15,263
I'm going because
my father has asked me to.

1113
01:06:16,389 --> 01:06:17,857
Not because I want to.

1114
01:06:18,558 --> 01:06:19,730
Do you understand?

1115
01:06:20,727 --> 01:06:21,728
Yes.

1116
01:06:23,521 --> 01:06:25,068
It's what you must do.

1117
01:06:26,065 --> 01:06:27,066
Thank you.

1118
01:06:29,068 --> 01:06:31,412
Could I call you then, and... And talk?

1119
01:06:32,864 --> 01:06:34,582
Oh, yes, of course.

1120
01:06:36,284 --> 01:06:37,752
Call me tomorrow.

1121
01:06:38,328 --> 01:06:39,375
All right?

1122
01:06:40,079 --> 01:06:41,126
Yes.

1123
01:06:43,833 --> 01:06:45,335
You won't drop it, will you?

1124
01:06:47,587 --> 01:06:48,588
No.

1125
01:06:50,840 --> 01:06:53,093
Don't let him wait alone.
Please go with him.

1126
01:07:10,652 --> 01:07:12,495
Anything I can get for you, Jenny?

(APPLAUSE)

1161
01:11:44,759 --> 01:11:46,439
- Did you call New York?
- Called New York.

1162
01:11:46,511 --> 01:11:48,559
- And?
- Well, it's a little complicated, honey.

1163
01:11:48,638 --> 01:11:50,449
- Well, tell me.
- Can't it wait till after the show?

1164
01:11:50,473 --> 01:11:52,100
No, it can't, George. Tell me.

1165
01:11:52,225 --> 01:11:54,398
- All right, you've got a case.
- I knew it.

1166
01:11:54,477 --> 01:11:55,524
I told you.

1167
01:11:56,229 --> 01:11:58,778
Ida, I've got a case.

1168
01:11:58,856 --> 01:12:00,779
Jenny, what you've got is a technicality.

1169
01:12:00,858 --> 01:12:04,283
Now, I'm gonna lay it out for you just
the way the lawyers laid it out for me.

1170
01:12:04,403 --> 01:12:06,684
The records were searched
and the adoption was legitimate.

1171
01:12:06,739 --> 01:12:07,831
JENNY: What'd you say?

1172
01:12:07,907 --> 01:12:09,750
I said, the adoption was legitimate.

1173
01:12:09,867 --> 01:12:11,244
As far as it went.

1174
01:12:11,285 --> 01:12:12,930
But there's such a thing as second papers.

1175
01:12:12,954 --> 01:12:14,139
Now, don't ask me what they are.

1176
01:12:14,163 --> 01:12:16,086
They're second papers
and you never signed them.

1177
01:12:16,624 --> 01:12:18,092
JENNY: Well, thank heaven for me.

1178
01:12:18,167 --> 01:12:19,978
Well, that means
if you wanna fight it, you can.

1179
01:12:20,002 --> 01:12:22,972
Now, no guarantees.
A whole long megillah in court.

1180
01:12:23,089 --> 01:12:24,841
Frankly, darling, it's a long shot.

1181
01:12:24,924 --> 01:12:26,926
JENNY: Well, did you tell them to go ahead?

1182
01:12:26,968 --> 01:12:29,016
No, I didn't tell them anything just yet.

1183
01:12:29,095 --> 01:12:30,938
JENNY; Well, tell them so!

1184
01:12:40,481 --> 01:12:42,779
George, will you please call the lawyers?

1185
01:12:44,777 --> 01:12:45,824
Jenny.

1186
01:12:46,529 --> 01:12:49,373
Jenny, right now, at this moment,
you're on top of a career

1187
01:12:49,448 --> 01:12:51,325
you've been building for over 20 years.

1188
01:12:51,409 --> 01:12:53,457
And half that time I've been with you.

1189
01:12:54,078 --> 01:12:56,126
So, I know a little bit about the subject.

1190
01:12:57,331 --> 01:13:01,507
Jenny, I can't stand by
and watch you destroy it and yourself.

1191
01:13:02,295 --> 01:13:04,898
If you fight this case, you might win.
It's possible, I don't know.

1192
01:13:04,922 --> 01:13:06,515
But do you realize what it would mean?

1193
01:13:06,591 --> 01:13:08,935
You couldn't be in Rome one week,
Miami the next.

1194
01:13:09,010 --> 01:13:12,184
No, you'd have to stay here, in England,
and fight it out in the courts.

1195
01:13:12,263 --> 01:13:14,391
Jenny, the boy's got a home,
he's got a father,

1196
01:13:14,473 --> 01:13:15,941
a school, a way of life.

1197
01:13:15,975 --> 01:13:19,229
You can't jump into the middle of that
and start making all kinds of waves.

1198
01:13:20,479 --> 01:13:22,652
Oh, George, please.

1199
01:13:22,690 --> 01:13:23,907
All right.

1200
01:13:23,983 --> 01:13:25,919
All right. Suppose, you got him.
What would you do with him?

1201
01:13:25,943 --> 01:13:28,196
Trail around the world
with a tutor from day to day?

1202
01:13:28,279 --> 01:13:30,748
Hotel suites, rented oars,
other people's houses.

1203
01:13:30,823 --> 01:13:32,718
And they're pretty strict
in England about schools.

1204
01:13:32,742 --> 01:13:34,094
You might have to send him to a school

1205
01:13:34,118 --> 01:13:36,667
and come and visit him now and then
at vacation time.

1206
01:13:36,704 --> 01:13:37,751
Jenny.

1207
01:13:38,247 --> 01:13:40,545
Jenny, you'd be strangers, don't you see?

1208
01:13:41,459 --> 01:13:43,177
- (STAMMERS)
- All right. All right.

1209
01:13:44,045 --> 01:13:45,843
And what would happen to you?

1210
01:13:45,880 --> 01:13:48,633
How would you be able to work
with this pull all the time?

1211
01:13:48,674 --> 01:13:51,018
I mean, do you know
how to handle a small boy?

1212
01:13:51,093 --> 01:13:52,970
It's a full-time job.

1213
01:13:53,220 --> 01:13:57,020
Forgive me, dear,
but I don't think you know how to do it.

1214
01:13:57,141 --> 01:13:59,143
This. All this. This is your job.

1215
01:13:59,185 --> 01:14:01,813
You do it better,
better than anybody else in the whole world

1216
01:14:01,854 --> 01:14:03,527
because you know it.

1217
01:14:03,648 --> 01:14:05,400
Don't force this, Jenny.

1218
01:14:05,483 --> 01:14:06,609
Let it rest.

1219
01:14:09,528 --> 01:14:12,873
George, I know you're trying
to help me, but...

1220
01:14:13,866 --> 01:14:15,994
You... You see, I love him.

1221
01:14:17,036 --> 01:14:20,586
And oddly enough, I think he loves me.

I've got to interrupt, I'm afraid.

No, not a bit.

Have you just got back?

1233
01:15:30,192 --> 01:15:31,785
I've been finishing some notes.

1234
01:15:31,861 --> 01:15:33,363
No, don't put it away.

1235

It's rather fine.

1236
01:15:39,452 --> 01:15:42,706
I've spent most of today
wondering how to explain things to you.

1237
01:15:42,788 --> 01:15:44,790
You've had some pretty rough things
flung at you,

1238
01:15:45,458 --> 01:15:47,131
and now you'd better have the truth.

1239

It's up to me to give it to you.

- Shall we sit down?
- Yes.

1241
01:15:54,300 --> 01:15:56,473
I don't know how much you heard today,

1242
01:15:56,552 --> 01:16:00,147
but I presume enough to know
that I'm your real father.

1243
01:16:00,222 --> 01:16:01,644
And Jenny's your mother.

1244
01:16:02,600 --> 01:16:04,523
Were you and Jenny married once?

1245
01:16:06,437 --> 01:16:08,360
No, Matt, we were never married.

1246
01:16:10,649 --> 01:16:13,448
We fell in love
while I was in New York, studying.

1247
01:16:13,861 --> 01:16:15,659
I did ask her to marry me.

1248
01:16:15,780 --> 01:16:17,373
To come home, to England.

1249
01:16:18,532 --> 01:16:20,159
But I hadn't reckoned with one thing.

1250
01:16:20,242 --> 01:16:22,762
That was her career, which meant more
to her than anything else.

1251
01:16:23,537 --> 01:16:27,758
I couldn't make her change her mind,
and I had to come back here to work.

1252
01:16:28,876 --> 01:16:30,219
So, I came alone.

1253
01:16:31,504 --> 01:16:34,508
- That's pretty clear, isn't it?
- Yes.

1254
01:16:39,428 --> 01:16:41,146
And then I met Janet again.

1255
01:16:41,680 --> 01:16:45,150
We'd known each other
since we were almost your age.

1256
01:16:45,184 --> 01:16:48,609
It was always rather expected
that we'd get married, so we did.

1257
01:16:51,148 --> 01:16:53,651
And then I heard
that you were about to be born.

1258
01:16:58,239 --> 01:16:59,957
Jenny did her best to look after you,

1259
01:17:00,032 --> 01:17:04,583
but touring the world with a small child
isn't always convenient.

1260
01:17:07,706 --> 01:17:09,549
So, Janet and I talked things over

1261
01:17:09,583 --> 01:17:11,853
and it was decided that you would
come and live with us as our son.

1262
01:17:11,877 --> 01:17:14,721
Our adopted son,
because that was kinder to Janet.

1263
01:17:16,549 --> 01:17:19,393
I don't understand
why you didn't tell me when Janet died.

1264
01:17:20,427 --> 01:17:22,771
I didn't expect you to understand entirely.

1265
01:17:23,222 --> 01:17:25,566
That'll take time. Perhaps a long time.

1266
01:17:27,059 --> 01:17:29,562
But the important thing now is your future.

1267
01:17:35,943 --> 01:17:36,990
(SIGHS)

1268
01:17:37,319 --> 01:17:39,117
Will you... Will you help me?

1269
01:17:39,572 --> 01:17:40,573
All right.

1270
01:17:41,740 --> 01:17:44,243
Well, you've promised to telephone Jenny.

1271
01:17:44,285 --> 01:17:47,129
- And I expect you'll be thinking about that.
- Yes.

1272
01:17:47,204 --> 01:17:48,922
And what shall you say to her?

1273
01:17:49,415 --> 01:17:51,167
What do you think I should say to her?

1274
01:17:51,250 --> 01:17:53,145
That's a decision
you have to make yourself, Matt.

1275
01:17:53,169 --> 01:17:55,297
But I can tell you what she'll say to you.

1276
01:17:55,379 --> 01:17:57,347
She'll ask you to meet her in Paris.

1277
01:17:57,423 --> 01:17:59,109
And when you get there,
it'll be another place.

1278
01:17:59,133 --> 01:18:00,569
- And then another...
- How do you know?

1279
01:18:00,593 --> 01:18:01,890
Because she wants you.

1280
01:18:01,927 --> 01:18:03,429
But she just said for a few days.

1281
01:18:03,470 --> 01:18:05,268
It doesn't stop there, Matt.

1282
01:18:05,347 --> 01:18:07,725
Just because you're angry with Jenny,
why should I be?

1283
01:18:07,808 --> 01:18:10,561
Look, I'm not angry with Jenny.
I'm not angry with her.

1284
01:18:10,644 --> 01:18:13,523
I know her,
and I know what I'm talking about.

1285
01:18:13,606 --> 01:18:15,449
She wants you, not for a weekend.

1286
01:18:15,983 --> 01:18:17,075
But you.

1287
01:18:18,068 --> 01:18:20,787
She wants you to leave your friends,
your home and your school.

1288
01:18:20,863 --> 01:18:22,240
To start a new way of life.

1289
01:18:23,574 --> 01:18:25,952
Matt, I... I know
what fun she's been to be with,

1290
01:18:26,035 --> 01:18:28,959
I know how kind she is,
and good and wise, too, sometimes.

1291
01:18:30,122 --> 01:18:31,965
And it would be exciting.

1292
01:18:32,041 --> 01:18:35,511
You'll see places you've never seen before,
you'll fly, you'd catch boats.

1293
01:18:37,671 --> 01:18:39,173
And you'd laugh a lot.

1294
01:18:40,382 --> 01:18:41,634
I know her, Matt.

1295
01:18:43,928 --> 01:18:44,975
I loved her.

1296
01:18:46,513 --> 01:18:48,140
I still do love her.

1297
01:18:48,224 --> 01:18:49,476
But mark this,

1298
01:18:50,434 --> 01:18:52,653
Jenny gives more love than anyone.

1299
01:18:52,728 --> 01:18:55,572
But she takes more love
than anyone can possibly give.

1300
01:18:56,607 --> 01:18:57,859
Can you understand that?

1301
01:18:59,109 --> 01:19:00,986
But what if I do go with her?

1302
01:19:01,070 --> 01:19:03,072
Well, if it was something
you really wanted to do

1303
01:19:03,155 --> 01:19:05,203
and was going to make you happy,
I'd get used to it.

1304
01:19:05,282 --> 01:19:06,534
So, you don't really care.

1305
01:19:06,617 --> 01:19:09,336
Oh, Matt, of course I care, you idiot.
Of course I care!

1306
01:19:09,370 --> 01:19:12,465
If it was up to me, I'd say,
"Go and telephone Jenny and say goodbye."

1307
01:19:13,040 --> 01:19:15,760
Tell her you've got a good life here
and you're not gonna muck it up.

1308
01:19:17,711 --> 01:19:19,258
Matt, you're my son.

1309
01:19:20,172 --> 01:19:21,173
I love you.

1310
01:19:22,174 --> 01:19:24,268
And I want you to go on being my son.

1311
01:20:39,710 --> 01:20:41,303
(TELEPHONE RINGING)

1312
01:20:43,756 --> 01:20:44,757
Hello.

1313
01:20:46,633 --> 01:20:48,101
Oh, Matt.

1314
01:20:48,177 --> 01:20:49,224
Hello.

1315
01:20:49,595 --> 01:20:52,098
How are you'? Are you... Are you all right?

1316
01:20:53,223 --> 01:20:57,774
Wake me'? No. I... I've just been
sitting here, waiting for you to call.

1317
01:20:58,437 --> 01:20:59,529
Where are you?

1318
01:21:01,607 --> 01:21:02,608
Oh, good.

1319
01:21:03,025 --> 01:21:05,824
Matt, would you come over
right away, please?

1320
01:21:06,320 --> 01:21:08,163
I've got so much to explain.

1321
01:21:09,156 --> 01:21:12,251
Everything was so hideous yesterday.

1322
01:21:13,285 --> 01:21:14,753
Especially for you.

1323
01:21:15,287 --> 01:21:18,541
Please, come over right away, darling.

1324
01:21:22,461 --> 01:21:26,091
Oh, well, what about this afternoon?
My day is free.

1325
01:21:29,468 --> 01:21:30,685
Why?

1326
01:21:30,761 --> 01:21:32,308
(CHUCKLES)

1327
01:21:32,346 --> 01:21:33,689
What's happening?

1328
01:21:38,477 --> 01:21:39,603
Oh.

1329
01:21:39,645 --> 01:21:42,364
Well, why don't you
bring your friends along?

1330
01:21:42,481 --> 01:21:47,157
And... And you and I can have
a private talk for a little while.

1331
01:21:47,194 --> 01:21:50,869
And then we can all join forces
and... And have a lovely day.

1332
01:22:00,749 --> 01:22:03,002
Yes, it sounds a bit complicated.

1333
01:22:04,711 --> 01:22:06,554
What about tomorrow, Matt?

1334
01:22:15,639 --> 01:22:17,892
My, you are a busy fellow. (CHUCKLES)

1335
01:22:20,352 --> 01:22:24,823
Matt, you know that trip to Paris
we were planning?

1336
01:22:24,940 --> 01:22:26,533
The one we talked about.

1337
01:22:28,193 --> 01:22:30,195
Oh, good, I've been thinking about it, too,

1338
01:22:30,237 --> 01:22:35,414
and I just don't see how I'm going
to be able to work things out.

1339
01:22:37,035 --> 01:22:38,332
Yes, that's right.

1340
01:22:38,370 --> 01:22:41,249
I'll be busy from morning till night,
and I have...

1341
01:22:41,331 --> 01:22:43,925
Well, we couldn't be together at all.

1342
01:22:44,001 --> 01:22:45,753
You might wind up very lonely.

1343
01:22:49,298 --> 01:22:50,971
I'm glad you understand.

1344
01:22:55,637 --> 01:22:58,436
Well, of course
you're going to be seeing me.

1345
01:22:58,557 --> 01:23:01,151
I'll be back in London in no time.

1346
01:23:01,768 --> 01:23:05,318
We'll have lots of laughs and lots of fun.

1347
01:23:06,398 --> 01:23:07,490
Okay?

1348
01:23:09,401 --> 01:23:10,402
All right.

1349
01:23:12,112 --> 01:23:15,457
Well, now, you take care of yourself,
you hear?

1350
01:23:17,159 --> 01:23:23,257
And thank you for being
such a fine young man.

1351
01:23:26,502 --> 01:23:27,594
Bye-bye.

1352
01:23:29,296 --> 01:23:30,388
Matt?

1353
01:23:32,341 --> 01:23:33,558
God bless.

1354
01:23:35,093 --> 01:23:36,094
(CRIES SOFTLY)

1355
01:23:44,895 --> 01:23:46,021
Ida.

1356
01:23:46,104 --> 01:23:48,698
Get me my black dress, I'm going out.

1357
01:23:49,066 --> 01:23:50,739
(ALARM RINGING)

1358
01:24:06,291 --> 01:24:07,668
Wait for me, will you?

1359
01:24:16,635 --> 01:24:17,636
(INAUDIBLE)

1360
01:24:21,431 --> 01:24:23,368
I hope you don't mind us
getting onto you, Mr. Donne.

1361
01:24:23,392 --> 01:24:25,453
But she was asking for you
and wouldn't see anyone else.

1362
01:24:25,477 --> 01:24:26,478
Where is she?

1363
01:24:26,520 --> 01:24:29,457
Of course, you realize we are trying to
keep this matter completely confidential.

1364
01:24:29,481 --> 01:24:30,542
Yes. Yes, of course. I know.

1365
01:24:30,566 --> 01:24:32,910
Unfortunately, we're full up at the moment,

1366
01:24:32,985 --> 01:24:34,703
so we had to put her in there.

1367
01:24:35,487 --> 01:24:36,488
Thank you very much.

1368
01:24:36,530 --> 01:24:38,841
- If there's anything you need...
- Yes, I'll let you know immediately.

1369
01:24:38,865 --> 01:24:39,866
- Right.
- Thank you.

1370
01:24:45,539 --> 01:24:50,090
Don't ever go to an exhibition
of abstract art for the millions.

1371
01:24:50,836 --> 01:24:52,429
No, I won't.

1372
01:24:52,504 --> 01:24:53,756
Thank you, nurse.

1373
01:24:55,090 --> 01:24:57,468
And if you do go, don't drink the martinis.

1374
01:24:57,801 --> 01:24:58,848
No.

1375
01:24:59,344 --> 01:25:01,142
Because they're half gasoline.

1376
01:25:01,763 --> 01:25:03,265
And you've had enough.

1377
01:25:03,348 --> 01:25:05,521
I've had enough to throw up Fire Island.

1378
01:25:06,435 --> 01:25:07,561
Does it show?

1379
01:25:07,644 --> 01:25:08,861
Someone told me.

1380
01:25:09,813 --> 01:25:11,360
That was pretty sneaky.

1381
01:25:11,982 --> 01:25:16,032
Oh, there's a young lord
I must warn you about.

1382
01:25:16,278 --> 01:25:17,404
- Oh?
- Hmm.

1383
01:25:18,363 --> 01:25:20,661
A young Lord George...

1384
01:25:20,699 --> 01:25:22,576
Hell, whatever his name was.

1385
01:25:22,659 --> 01:25:25,412
He asked me if he could take me home.

1386
01:25:25,495 --> 01:25:27,247
And I said thank you.

1387
01:25:27,372 --> 01:25:28,749
And we got into a cab.

1388
01:25:28,832 --> 01:25:32,052
The next thing I knew, it was "all
fall down" and I wound up with this.

1389
01:25:33,545 --> 01:25:35,513
He knew where he lived, all right.

1390
01:25:36,381 --> 01:25:39,635
But I was out. I was out cold. I was out.

1391
01:25:40,135 --> 01:25:41,728
And nobody asked me where I lived.

1392
01:25:41,762 --> 01:25:43,389
Well, how did you get here?

1393
01:25:43,930 --> 01:25:46,649
Cab driver named Gerald.

1394
01:25:48,060 --> 01:25:49,528
Gerald brought me here.

1395
01:25:49,895 --> 01:25:53,115
And they fixed my foot
and they gave me coffee.

1396
01:25:53,523 --> 01:25:57,369
And somebody asked for an autograph
for their cousin Marilyn.

1397
01:25:57,402 --> 01:26:00,121
Oh! I feel awful, David.

1398
01:26:00,864 --> 01:26:03,413
- Have some of this, come on.
- Oh, no more coffee. No.

1399
01:26:03,450 --> 01:26:07,045
I couldn't take any more coffee. If you...
You'd have to feed me through the vein.

1400
01:26:07,079 --> 01:26:10,959
I'm full. I'm full to the brim
with the whole goddamn world.

1401
01:26:11,041 --> 01:26:13,260
Yes, but now, come on.
Be good, drink this. Come on.

1402
01:26:13,293 --> 01:26:14,840
Have you come to take me home?

1403
01:26:14,920 --> 01:26:17,139
No, I've come to take you to the theater.

1404
01:26:19,841 --> 01:26:21,593
Oh, no, you haven't.

1405
01:26:21,677 --> 01:26:23,029
- I'm not going back there.
- Drink some of this.

1406
01:26:23,053 --> 01:26:26,432
- I'm not going back there ever, ever again.
- Listen, they are waiting.

1407
01:26:26,515 --> 01:26:28,267
I don't care if they're fasting.

1408
01:26:28,308 --> 01:26:31,079
You just give 'em their money back
and tell them to come back next fall.

1409
01:26:31,103 --> 01:26:33,822
- Jenny, it's a sellout.
- I'm always a sellout.

1410
01:26:33,897 --> 01:26:35,740
You promised. They're waiting.

1411
01:26:35,774 --> 01:26:39,119
- There's George and Ida and 200,000...
- George and Ida and 200,000, I know that.

1412
01:26:39,152 --> 01:26:41,280
I know. Just let them wait.
To hell with them.

1413
01:26:41,905 --> 01:26:44,374
I'm... Can't be spread so thin.

1414
01:26:44,700 --> 01:26:46,373
I'm just one person.

1415
01:26:46,451 --> 01:26:50,172
I don't wanna be rolled out like a pastry
so everybody'd get a nice, big bite of me.

1416
01:26:50,288 --> 01:26:51,540
Mmm-hmm.

1417
01:26:51,623 --> 01:26:53,717
I'm just me. I belong to myself.

1418
01:26:53,792 --> 01:26:57,092
I can do whatever I damn well please
with myself,

1419
01:26:57,129 --> 01:26:58,802
and nobody can ask any questions.

01:26:58,839 --> 01:27:00,274
Now, you know that is not true, don't you?

1421
01:27:00,298 --> 01:27:03,268
Well, I'm not gonna do it anymore.
And that's final.

1422
01:27:04,886 --> 01:27:08,516
I... It's just not worth all the deaths
that I have to die.

1423
01:27:08,598 --> 01:27:12,148
You have... You have a show to do tonight.
You are going to do it.

1424
01:27:12,227 --> 01:27:14,355
And I am going to see that you do.

1425
01:27:15,981 --> 01:27:17,949
You think you can make me sing?

1426
01:27:17,983 --> 01:27:19,200
Do you think you can...

1427
01:27:19,276 --> 01:27:21,574
Do you think George can make me sing?
Or Ida?

1428
01:27:21,653 --> 01:27:24,372
You can get me there, sure,
but can you make me sing?

1429
01:27:24,448 --> 01:27:26,871
- No, we...
- I sing for myself. I sing when I want to.

1430
01:27:26,992 --> 01:27:28,835
Whenever I want to. Just for me.

1431
01:27:28,869 --> 01:27:30,337
- I sing for my own pleasure.
- Yes.

1432
01:27:30,370 --> 01:27:31,496
- Yes.
- Whenever I want.

1433
01:27:31,580 --> 01:27:33,141
- Do you understand that?
- Yes, I do understand that.

1434
01:27:33,165 --> 01:27:35,042
Just hang onto that, will you?
Hang onto that.

1435
01:27:35,167 --> 01:27:39,297
Well, I've hung onto every bit of rubbish
there is to hang onto in life.

1436
01:27:39,463 --> 01:27:41,761
And I've thrown all the good bits away.

1437
01:27:41,840 --> 01:27:43,592
- Now, can you tell me why I do that?
- No.

1438
01:27:43,675 --> 01:27:45,153
No, no. I can't tell you why you do that.

1439
01:27:45,177 --> 01:27:47,225
But I can tell you this,
you are going to be late.

1440
01:27:48,263 --> 01:27:49,560
I don't care.

1441
01:27:54,478 --> 01:27:55,695
Darling,

1442
01:27:59,691 --> 01:28:03,195
I don't give a damn who you letdown.

1443
01:28:04,863 --> 01:28:07,116
But you're not gonna let you down.

1444
01:28:11,119 --> 01:28:14,373
You haven't called me that for years.

1445
01:28:15,707 --> 01:28:17,960
I haven't been able
to call you that for years.

1446
01:28:18,293 --> 01:28:20,521
Now, come here, look.
Just look at me. Please, look at me.

1447
01:28:20,545 --> 01:28:22,513
- Are you listening to me?
- Hmm.

1448
01:28:23,465 --> 01:28:26,685
There's something I haven't been able
to say to you in years, too.

1449
01:28:27,761 --> 01:28:29,388
- L...
- David, don't.

1450
01:28:31,598 --> 01:28:33,566
Don't say it.

1451
01:28:34,684 --> 01:28:36,357
Because if you said it now

1452
01:28:37,479 --> 01:28:38,981
and if you didn't mean it,

1453
01:28:39,064 --> 01:28:41,738
(SOBBING) I think I'd... I think I'd die.

1454
01:28:43,527 --> 01:28:46,076
- I'll mean it.
- Mmm-mmm.

1455
01:28:48,114 --> 01:28:49,331
I love you.

He didn't want to go with me.

He didn't want to.

1462

He made all kinds of excuses.

1463

He didn't want to stay with me.

David...

1470
01:29:38,373 --> 01:29:39,795
You wouldn't cheat me, would you?

1471
01:29:39,833 --> 01:29:42,019
- You wouldn't pretend to me.
- Oh, darling, I wouldn't cheat you.

1472
01:29:42,043 --> 01:29:43,312
You wouldn't say you love me, would you?

1473
01:29:43,336 --> 01:29:45,690
- No, I wouldn't say I love you if I didn't.
- Then tell me again.

JENNY: Please tell me, again.
Please, once.

I'll tell you as often as you want me to.

That's where it ends.

We were the right people
that met at the wrong moment.

With all the right ideals.

1482
01:30:10,822 --> 01:30:15,202
We were just too strong-headed
to give up everything for each other.

1483
01:30:20,081 --> 01:30:21,924
We just didn't fit.
