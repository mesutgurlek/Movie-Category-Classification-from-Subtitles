1
00:01:03,410 --> 00:01:05,401
Tea, Tea...

2
00:01:11,951 --> 00:01:14,442
Her father has already woken up.
They wake up at the wrong time

3
00:01:15,388 --> 00:01:18,516
Get me one tea.
- Will you have one?

4
00:01:19,225 --> 00:01:20,988
No, I don't drink tea
- Good habit.

5
00:01:21,526 --> 00:01:25,394
Even my friend Subbu doesn't drink
coffee or tea. He has only whiskey

6
00:01:26,832 --> 00:01:30,165
He used to travel in local trains
to Bezavar, but never got down there

7
00:01:30,434 --> 00:01:32,561
Because he used to sleep off just
before Bezawar station

8
00:01:32,803 --> 00:01:35,829
And he used to get up when the train
arrived at Bezawar on its return

9
00:01:36,007 --> 00:01:37,736
Where are you getting down?
- Secunderabad

10
00:01:37,909 --> 00:01:41,970
The train has already passed that station
- Passed? Please hold this...

11
00:01:42,345 --> 00:01:44,472
Secunderabad has passed by.
Give me place, move...!

12
00:01:55,324 --> 00:01:58,054
Nampally? They told me Secunderabad
had passed by, so I jumped

13
00:01:58,260 --> 00:02:00,160
Didn't you know it's Nampally
after Secunderabad?

14
00:02:00,329 --> 00:02:03,457
I know only Anakapalli.
Well, how can I reach Chikadapalli?

15
00:02:03,631 --> 00:02:11,094
There are two ways, either you can
follow the track or take a rickshaw

16
00:02:12,439 --> 00:02:15,431
Everybody here is confused
and confuses me also

17
00:02:46,570 --> 00:02:50,904
You know what's the time now?
- Can't you see the clock and know?

18
00:02:51,075 --> 00:02:55,068
Stupid jokes in the morning. They may
be here any moment. Get up...

19
00:02:55,244 --> 00:02:59,237
Aunty, how do I look?
- You look beautiful.

20
00:03:00,149 --> 00:03:02,481
She is younger to you and
she is already dressed

21
00:03:02,919 --> 00:03:05,683
Learn from her.
- I 'll learn later

22
00:03:05,854 --> 00:03:10,484
If she is so sleepy then instead of
her, you can get me engaged

23
00:03:12,594 --> 00:03:16,325
Get up... go freshen yourself
- Demon!

24
00:03:17,498 --> 00:03:19,432
Get up... move

25
00:03:27,941 --> 00:03:30,739
Well, why are you wearing a suit?
- Do you think it doesn't suit me?

26
00:03:31,277 --> 00:03:34,610
Today is your daughter's engagement.
Why don't you try some ethnic wear?

27
00:03:34,748 --> 00:03:41,278
Ethnic wear? Don't act like an old lady
- To match with you, I'll wear a gown?

28
00:03:43,055 --> 00:03:46,752
Then why don't you try jeans and T-shirt
- Is that enough?

29
00:03:46,959 --> 00:03:51,453
Short skirts would be much better.
- How naughty of you!

30
00:03:53,031 --> 00:03:55,363
It's your responsibility to
take care of guests

31
00:03:55,400 --> 00:03:58,335
Where are the betel leaves?
- It's in the store room

32
00:03:58,568 --> 00:04:02,800
Arrange everything as soon as possible.
Also dress up Nandu

33
00:04:02,906 --> 00:04:04,601
Okay, I'll do it
- Hurry up

34
00:04:05,675 --> 00:04:06,733
Hello.
- Hello.

35
00:04:06,910 --> 00:04:08,434
Send the pooja items and I 'll
prepare for the ritual

36
00:04:09,111 --> 00:04:12,274
Things are yet to arrive.
In the meantime, let's play a pack.

37
00:04:12,381 --> 00:04:16,215
Which game?
- Seven express. It'll finish soon.

38
00:04:16,685 --> 00:04:18,516
Then I'll be finished
- You will know only when you play!

39
00:04:18,654 --> 00:04:21,487
I'm not a fool to be bankrupted!

40
00:04:21,656 --> 00:04:25,217
I'll go for a death ceremony
but will never play with you.

41
00:04:25,460 --> 00:04:27,621
You are getting scared.
- I am safe protecting myself.

42
00:04:27,762 --> 00:04:32,495
Last year, my father who came for
the pooja lost playing to you...

43
00:04:32,733 --> 00:04:35,167
...and had to marry four times
over, to repay his debts

44
00:04:35,335 --> 00:04:37,803
One game of yours was enough for our
entire family to learn a lesson.

45
00:04:38,005 --> 00:04:41,065
People aren't ready to try their luck.
- Hey, listen...

46
00:04:41,741 --> 00:04:43,299
What's it?
- Can you get me a cup of coffee?

47
00:04:43,609 --> 00:04:45,668
If you disturb me when I am busy
I'll divorce you. Be careful.

48
00:04:46,546 --> 00:04:49,276
She only warns me, but I don't know
when she will do that?

49
00:04:49,615 --> 00:04:51,674
Very understanding marital
relationship!

50
00:04:53,085 --> 00:04:55,485
Banti... get the coffee here.
Give it to me

51
00:05:00,025 --> 00:05:02,823
Why is there more sugar?
- I always have it with more sugar.

52
00:05:03,294 --> 00:05:06,092
You were having this coffee.
- Yes

53
00:05:06,330 --> 00:05:08,730
You should have told me before.
- You should have asked me before.

54
00:05:09,500 --> 00:05:12,162
You are not listening to elders!
- I'll brush my teeth and listen.

55
00:05:13,303 --> 00:05:14,702
You haven't even brushed?

56
00:05:23,312 --> 00:05:25,610
How much?
- Fifty rupees.

57
00:05:27,516 --> 00:05:30,144
Anakapalli to Nampalli was 150 and
from Nampally to Chikanapalli is 50?

58
00:05:30,552 --> 00:05:36,115
What do you get for Rs.50 nowadays?
- Passengers will get a heart attack!

59
00:05:43,731 --> 00:05:49,795
I don't like all these formalities.
- Move aside.

60
00:05:50,871 --> 00:05:53,499
It wasn't for me! Thank God,
nobody saw me getting fooled.

61
00:06:06,751 --> 00:06:12,087
Was the journey peaceful?
- The berths were too small to sleep in.

62
00:06:12,423 --> 00:06:16,792
Then he should reduce his size!
- Even you need to do the same.

63
00:06:17,094 --> 00:06:19,460
When did you return the from US?
- Yesterday morning

64
00:06:19,730 --> 00:06:21,561
Are you staying?
- I am leaving by tomorrow evening

65
00:06:21,832 --> 00:06:25,290
You have come for your engagement
and you can stay for a month

66
00:06:25,469 --> 00:06:27,733
Then I will have to stay
here permanently

67
00:06:35,778 --> 00:06:37,609
Hurry up. Why so late? Come fast.
- Should I come like this?

68
00:06:37,846 --> 00:06:40,406
No! Wear the sari and come soon.
- That's what I'm doing!

69
00:06:40,615 --> 00:06:42,139
You come downstairs...
I will tell you

70
00:06:46,221 --> 00:06:49,122
You are...?
- I am Venki, Mr. Shekar's son.

71
00:06:49,256 --> 00:06:52,919
Shekar's son! Why are you standing
there like a guest? Come on in.

72
00:06:53,460 --> 00:06:55,928
Show him the room upstairs.
It's my daughter's engagement

73
00:06:56,230 --> 00:06:58,755
Your father was supposed to come?
- He couldn't make it as he was busy.

74
00:06:59,332 --> 00:07:03,325
We'll speak later on. You go now.
- Please come

75
00:07:06,306 --> 00:07:08,638
Is he the guy to be engaged?
- Yes.

76
00:07:08,807 --> 00:07:11,708
He is very handsome. What's he doing?
- An engineer in U.S. What about you?

77
00:07:11,843 --> 00:07:13,606
A graduate in Anakapalli.

78
00:07:15,480 --> 00:07:17,744
The room is on top, you can leave.

79
00:07:22,320 --> 00:07:26,256
Are you getting bored?
Shall we play a game?

80
00:07:26,657 --> 00:07:29,717
Now?
- It's your engagement, not marriage

81
00:07:29,859 --> 00:07:32,885
Till the bride arrives, we shall
play two games and spend time.

82
00:07:35,765 --> 00:07:37,562
You take it.
- Master was asking for a pack of cards.

83
00:07:37,767 --> 00:07:39,860
To play?
- To throw it!

84
00:07:41,570 --> 00:07:45,472
What are you doing?
- I am thinking of what to do.

85
00:07:45,708 --> 00:07:47,642
I don't like to do things in haste...

86
00:07:47,776 --> 00:07:51,268
And if I do, people should
remember me. That is my policy.

87
00:07:51,980 --> 00:07:54,972
Now...

88
00:07:57,352 --> 00:08:01,618
Thanks buddy, you have called me at
the right time. A man was boring me

89
00:08:01,855 --> 00:08:04,619
Function? It is yet to start.

90
00:08:10,697 --> 00:08:17,933
Already started having drinks? As
soon I finish, I'll join you

91
00:08:27,712 --> 00:08:33,548
You are looking good in this sari.
You look better without it.

92
00:08:36,520 --> 00:08:39,887
We have a soup before dinner
to increase your appetite...

93
00:08:40,257 --> 00:08:43,988
We drink milk before going to bed
to have sound sleep...

94
00:08:44,527 --> 00:08:48,930
So... what should be done before
getting engaged? Shall I tell you?

95
00:08:56,738 --> 00:08:58,262
Where are you?
- In the bathroom.

96
00:08:58,407 --> 00:09:01,467
Everyone's waiting for you.
- I'll come in a moment

97
00:09:07,882 --> 00:09:09,406
Who are you?
- Who is he?

98
00:09:09,650 --> 00:09:12,847
The guy getting engaged.
- He is getting engaged with one...

99
00:09:12,987 --> 00:09:14,818
...having fun with another.

100
00:09:15,056 --> 00:09:18,514
Don't talk rubbish. I am his fiancee
- Positive?

101
00:09:22,395 --> 00:09:28,561
Though he is handsome,
he has such bad tastes

102
00:09:36,275 --> 00:09:41,804
Look there! They are such a mismatch!
Why does God make such mistakes?

103
00:09:42,613 --> 00:09:45,605
You are mistaken. She is my wife!
- I guessed it

104
00:09:46,718 --> 00:09:49,482
Everybody here loves to shock me!

105
00:09:51,888 --> 00:09:54,823
Sujatha hasn't arrived yet?
- No, not yet.

106
00:09:56,360 --> 00:10:00,421
At least she should have called us.
- Are you expecting someone?

107
00:10:01,364 --> 00:10:03,992
Yes, it was my sister.
- Shall we wait for some more time?

108
00:10:04,900 --> 00:10:06,390
No problem, we'll start.

109
00:10:07,336 --> 00:10:13,571
There's an auspicious day after
two months for the marriage

110
00:10:13,641 --> 00:10:16,474
Even my son needs around 45 days,
to go to the US and come back.

111
00:10:16,611 --> 00:10:18,943
So we can conclude that you
agree to the date?

112
00:10:19,880 --> 00:10:29,915
In the presence of God, Nandini
and Prasad are engaged.

113
00:10:30,123 --> 00:10:35,322
Now, you may exchange sweets

114
00:10:55,679 --> 00:10:58,705
It's me, Seenu.
- Has my son arrived?

115
00:10:58,849 --> 00:11:00,817
But you didn't come.
- I was a bit busy.

116
00:11:00,985 --> 00:11:05,354
Every time you excuse yourself.
- Am I not eager to meet you?

117
00:11:05,488 --> 00:11:06,614
I'll definitely be there for
your daughter's marriage.

118
00:11:06,790 --> 00:11:13,628
I'll murder you if you don't come.
- Will my son be of any use?

119
00:11:13,762 --> 00:11:16,959
If he visits the house then I'll tell
you whether he is of any use or not.

120
00:11:17,132 --> 00:11:19,430
Hasn't he come to your house?

121
00:11:19,701 --> 00:11:27,733
Morning, I had a glimpse of him.
That's it. Is he allergic to functions?

122
00:11:28,009 --> 00:11:32,912
Don't be worried. It's 12 p.m,
he'll be back in 15 minutes.

123
00:11:33,380 --> 00:11:36,645
How come you are so sure?
- Everyday he watches late night movies

124
00:11:36,817 --> 00:11:38,682
Everyday, late night movies?
- Don't be so surprised.

125
00:11:38,785 --> 00:11:43,051
He has many more habits like this,
I'll write to you in detail

126
00:11:43,390 --> 00:11:47,417
Happy reading.
- Wait... I think he has arrived

127
00:11:47,660 --> 00:11:51,096
Call him, I want to talk to him
- You want to ask about the movies?

128
00:11:51,163 --> 00:11:54,189
No, it isn't that...
- Disconnect the phone, I'll talk.

129
00:11:57,068 --> 00:12:00,970
Where are you coming from?
- There was a prayer meeting in temple

130
00:12:02,407 --> 00:12:09,870
It was boring, so I went to a movie
- Aren't you ashamed to do such things?

131
00:12:11,748 --> 00:12:15,741
Your father wants you to learn
computers and sends you abroad

132
00:12:16,419 --> 00:12:23,518
You roam about watching movies?
What do you know?

133
00:12:23,593 --> 00:12:25,493
I know swimming.

134
00:12:28,997 --> 00:12:31,090
Anything else?
- I am interested in music.

135
00:12:32,968 --> 00:12:36,563
I play the harmonium, mrudangam
- Have you brought them here?

136
00:12:36,770 --> 00:12:39,603
No,sir.
- And...

137
00:12:41,108 --> 00:12:44,942
I paint
- Where? On the road or boards?

138
00:12:45,012 --> 00:12:48,846
It's on paper
- What do you do for a living?

139
00:12:49,015 --> 00:12:52,246
I have completed my B.A
- In how many years?

140
00:12:55,788 --> 00:12:58,586
You have completed it quite fast!
- I worked hard in the last year.

141
00:12:58,790 --> 00:13:01,657
Okay, your father asked me to
arrange a job for you

142
00:13:01,727 --> 00:13:05,527
I'll arrange for it.
Have dinner and then sleep.

143
00:13:05,631 --> 00:13:09,032
In the morning show him the outhouse.
- Why outhouse? Outside arrangement

144
00:13:09,567 --> 00:13:15,267
Yes, the outhouse would be comfortable.
- You've to stay even if uncomfortable

145
00:13:24,047 --> 00:13:27,483
Don't keep the bag here and there...
he'll get angry.

146
00:13:30,786 --> 00:13:33,914
Don't use lights unnecessarily.

147
00:13:35,524 --> 00:13:38,493
Can I open the windows?
- I don't like it.

148
00:13:41,963 --> 00:13:44,488
Boss expects tidiness and discipline

149
00:13:44,632 --> 00:13:48,159
You know Hanuman?
- I have seen him in the temple.

150
00:13:48,836 --> 00:13:53,671
Boss is like God Rama, his wife is
Sita. Hence house is named as Ayodhya

151
00:13:54,107 --> 00:13:56,632
Out house is Lanka?
- Is it a joke?

152
00:13:57,844 --> 00:13:59,903
Why are such people here?

153
00:14:01,247 --> 00:14:04,273
Cigarettes not allowed here. Have
manners. Else you'll be thrown out.

154
00:14:04,850 --> 00:14:12,222
Don't remove it until I leave.
- If you leave, I can change?

155
00:14:15,126 --> 00:14:17,924
As though this is the Taj Mahal! These
rules are like rules for tourists

156
00:14:18,063 --> 00:14:20,861
Don't use lights nor windows,
don't sit nor stand.

157
00:14:21,032 --> 00:14:25,196
Why all this? To take photographs
This guy is too much.

158
00:14:28,305 --> 00:14:30,296
I am coming.
you'll have it now...

159
00:14:34,544 --> 00:14:37,138
Did I disturb you?
- No, aunty. Come in

160
00:14:38,881 --> 00:14:42,214
Are you comfortable here?
- Yes, I am.

161
00:14:42,552 --> 00:14:45,783
I was busy during the ceremony,,
hence I couldn't take care of you

162
00:14:47,956 --> 00:14:50,925
Don't feel bad. I have brought the
sweets for you. Take it.

163
00:14:54,895 --> 00:14:59,730
Has your father stopped smoking?
- Will he ever listen to me?

164
00:14:59,867 --> 00:15:02,301
I have warned him several times
that it may cost his health.

165
00:15:02,737 --> 00:15:04,762
Only your mother could have
controlled him

166
00:15:04,904 --> 00:15:09,068
Everybody told him to get married
after your mother's death...

167
00:15:09,309 --> 00:15:13,678
He used to say if he gets married he
can get a wife not a mother for him

168
00:15:15,381 --> 00:15:18,908
All are not as lucky as you are
to have such a father

169
00:15:20,019 --> 00:15:24,581
He is also a very good friend, it was
because of him we came to the city

170
00:15:24,757 --> 00:15:27,954
We are enjoying this life
only because of him

171
00:15:29,093 --> 00:15:32,119
We invited him many a times to this
house but he never came here.

172
00:15:32,764 --> 00:15:37,133
At least I am lucky to serve
food to you if not to him.

173
00:15:37,768 --> 00:15:42,262
You didn't tell me how the sweets are.
- I remembered my mother.

174
00:15:50,613 --> 00:15:52,274
Can you just drop those dirty cards?
- Why?

175
00:15:52,415 --> 00:15:54,349
Today is an auspicious day.
- So?

176
00:15:54,483 --> 00:15:57,043
I have to take your blessings
- What madness!

177
00:15:57,420 --> 00:16:00,753
Why should I drop my cards
for that? Here are my feet.

178
00:16:01,289 --> 00:16:07,717
I'll chop off your legs, then you
can continue with your cards

179
00:16:07,896 --> 00:16:11,297
No violent decisions. Here they are.
- Take these.

180
00:16:13,901 --> 00:16:16,893
Are you free?
- One minute. My legs are busy.

181
00:16:18,805 --> 00:16:22,832
Book the hall for marriage as now
it is the season for marriages

182
00:16:23,309 --> 00:16:24,970
It's enough.

183
00:16:26,646 --> 00:16:32,642
If you don't mind, can you keep this
inside? ...I'll get the remaining.

184
00:16:47,698 --> 00:16:51,259
Why do you carry everything at a time?
- It's okay...

185
00:16:51,835 --> 00:16:55,202
He doesn't know anything
other than jobs.

186
00:16:55,405 --> 00:16:57,305
You should have given some to
the guy staying in the outhouse

187
00:16:57,474 --> 00:16:59,465
Even he is carrying

188
00:17:14,455 --> 00:17:19,518
Why are you standing there? Come here
- You look very tired, sit down

189
00:17:22,295 --> 00:17:24,092
What was I speaking about?
- About the marriage sweets

190
00:17:24,364 --> 00:17:26,355
There should be at least 5 to 6
different varieties of sweets

191
00:17:26,533 --> 00:17:28,865
The sweet jilabi must be there

192
00:17:29,035 --> 00:17:32,732
She shouldn't be present during the
preparation of sweets, note this also

193
00:17:32,905 --> 00:17:36,898
I forgot about the pickle.
- Don't worry. He'll cut them.

194
00:17:37,042 --> 00:17:39,374
Is it a pack of cards?
- No, mango pieces.

195
00:17:39,512 --> 00:17:42,709
I'll not do these kind of jobs
- Both of you quarrel later on.

196
00:17:42,882 --> 00:17:46,079
First list the things, I am worried.
- Why are you worried?

197
00:17:46,217 --> 00:17:49,186
We don't build houses ourselves,
laborers do those things for us.

198
00:17:49,354 --> 00:17:52,414
Likewise in the marriage, give a
contract and they will do it.

199
00:17:52,524 --> 00:17:54,924
Who are they?
- Marriage contractors

200
00:17:55,859 --> 00:17:59,761
Show them a house, they'll dig up tents
Pay their bills, they'll prepare food

201
00:17:59,997 --> 00:18:04,764
Show them guests, they'll take care.
They'll arrange for everything.

202
00:18:04,901 --> 00:18:09,804
They'll arrange girls of age 16-18
years to welcome guests.

203
00:18:10,973 --> 00:18:13,168
All we need to do is to get dressed
and pose for the photographs

204
00:18:13,276 --> 00:18:16,541
Can we wish the new couple or even
that is done by them on our behalf?

205
00:18:17,045 --> 00:18:21,778
Shut up. I liked it, what do you say?
- Even I am impressed

206
00:18:22,918 --> 00:18:26,911
Venky, didn't you like it?
- Everybody on earth will like it

207
00:18:27,087 --> 00:18:29,487
I didn't like it
- Didn't like, he mustn't have got it.

208
00:18:29,557 --> 00:18:34,859
What is there? Plastic chair, paper
plates, rented relatives, that's it.

209
00:18:35,162 --> 00:18:37,255
Do you expect us to use teak chairs
and copper plates?

210
00:18:37,463 --> 00:18:40,057
No, it is not that! Decorating the
tent in a traditional way...

211
00:18:40,200 --> 00:18:44,136
serving food on plantain leaves,
this is how a marriage should be.

212
00:18:45,905 --> 00:18:51,537
Marriage should be full of enthusiasm,
lots of activities. What is your name?

213
00:18:51,844 --> 00:18:54,972
Padma will ask, where are the saris?
- It's in the wardrobe.

214
00:18:55,113 --> 00:19:01,382
Meanwhile, he asks, would 1000 chairs
be enough or should I order 500 more?

215
00:19:01,519 --> 00:19:03,384
You'll be on phone, asking your
relatives to be here in advance.

216
00:19:03,588 --> 00:19:07,490
Look, they have come already.
Please take your seats

217
00:19:08,525 --> 00:19:11,119
You'll say "What are you looking for?
Get some coffee for them"

218
00:19:11,261 --> 00:19:15,391
She'll ask "How do I look in this
golden waistband?"

219
00:19:15,498 --> 00:19:18,990
It's very expensive.
- Shut up. I'll wear it

220
00:19:19,902 --> 00:19:22,063
It's only about jewelry and sari.
What about bridegroom?

221
00:19:22,304 --> 00:19:23,828
I was about to describe it.

222
00:19:24,306 --> 00:19:28,037
In this chaos, the bridegroom's guests
arrive and the tents are to be put up

223
00:19:28,177 --> 00:19:30,304
I've already arranged for it.
- It was at the hall, now it's at home

224
00:19:30,812 --> 00:19:36,546
"The tents should be like the blue
sky decorated with clouds"

225
00:20:06,678 --> 00:20:12,913
"This marriage should be
the talk of the town"

226
00:20:16,286 --> 00:20:24,250
"This is about sharing love
and building relationships"

227
00:20:25,161 --> 00:20:32,932
"It's an opportunity to meet dear
ones and make new friends"

228
00:20:33,902 --> 00:20:38,601
"The tradition decoration is
inviting the people with warmth"

229
00:20:38,774 --> 00:20:43,234
"An occasion to get blessed
and wished by the elders"

230
00:21:10,969 --> 00:21:13,961
"The bride is shy and blushing"

231
00:21:14,139 --> 00:21:19,304
"The bridegroom is waiting
to have a glimpse of her"

232
00:21:20,745 --> 00:21:27,651
"It's time for the bride and
bridegroom to take the vows"

233
00:21:29,886 --> 00:21:36,291
"The bride is at her best
in her bridal fineries"

234
00:21:38,360 --> 00:21:42,524
"This a metamorphosis
from a girl to a woman"

235
00:21:43,065 --> 00:21:48,059
"They have been declared
'Man' and 'Wife"'

236
00:22:44,354 --> 00:22:48,347
"Some are having fun and enjoying"

237
00:22:48,725 --> 00:22:53,059
"Some are busy and confused"

238
00:22:54,062 --> 00:23:02,128
"Some are leisurely playing cards"

239
00:23:03,404 --> 00:23:10,503
"Some are eager to have the flavoured,
delicious marriage feast"

240
00:23:12,078 --> 00:23:16,913
"Some are showing off their
jewellery to each other"

241
00:23:17,417 --> 00:23:22,753
"It's worth watching these
unique moments of the marriage"

242
00:24:49,396 --> 00:24:53,958
What are you reading? Class notes?
- No, a love letter

243
00:24:55,135 --> 00:24:59,572
You are still in high school?
- To love, age is never a barrier.

244
00:25:00,072 --> 00:25:02,632
I am fool to ask you.

245
00:25:06,012 --> 00:25:07,741
I am very angry at you.
- Why?

246
00:25:07,879 --> 00:25:08,937
Because you missed my engagement

247
00:25:11,683 --> 00:25:17,918
I tried my best, but the condition of
my grand mother condition was serious

248
00:25:18,256 --> 00:25:19,416
Why? What happened?

249
00:25:19,823 --> 00:25:22,189
Is she dead?
- If she dies, it's good luck

250
00:25:23,260 --> 00:25:27,219
She is again alive. I am tensed she
may die on the day of your marriage

251
00:25:31,200 --> 00:25:34,897
Any other news?
- No news. Life is so boring

252
00:25:35,638 --> 00:25:40,075
I feel like running away some where.
- Philosophical words don't suit you

253
00:25:41,610 --> 00:25:45,137
You got engaged at this young age
and now you can speak like that.

254
00:25:45,347 --> 00:25:48,111
Have you become old?
- Not old, but wasting my youth

255
00:25:48,283 --> 00:25:50,615
So get married and finish it off.

256
00:25:54,121 --> 00:25:56,385
Apart from marriage don't you
have any other ambitions?

257
00:25:56,557 --> 00:25:59,151
The truth is, I'm marrying
only for my elders

258
00:25:59,293 --> 00:26:03,354
My ambition is directly to do
the things... without marriage

259
00:26:03,663 --> 00:26:05,631
You know to talk nonsense!

260
00:26:08,635 --> 00:26:11,229
You have gone down.
- He is working nowadays.

261
00:26:11,370 --> 00:26:13,361
She will think it's the truth.

262
00:26:17,676 --> 00:26:19,940
Why is he struggling so much?
- The food wasn't digested!

263
00:26:21,814 --> 00:26:25,716
Who is he?
- Father knows him. Acts extra smart.

264
00:26:28,786 --> 00:26:32,984
He has a good physique
- His bio-data would be worse

265
00:26:52,008 --> 00:26:53,999
Sister, I have a doubt.
- What's it?

266
00:26:54,142 --> 00:26:57,475
Why did he come out and then go in?
- Acting smart.

267
00:26:59,681 --> 00:27:02,309
Warn him to do his exercises
inside the house and...

268
00:27:02,450 --> 00:27:05,283
...not to exhibit himself
when my friends are here

269
00:27:05,419 --> 00:27:07,011
Should I tell him strongly?
- Very strongly!

270
00:27:07,287 --> 00:27:09,278
Now you can relax,
I'll take care of him

271
00:27:22,068 --> 00:27:24,969
What's that?
- You are here to ask this? Fridge.

272
00:27:25,204 --> 00:27:27,866
I want to know what's on top of it?
- Socks!

273
00:27:28,140 --> 00:27:30,472
Why are the socks on the fridge?
- There was no place hence...

274
00:27:30,876 --> 00:27:33,174
So you had to throw it there?

275
00:27:34,212 --> 00:27:37,875
What's this? Underwear on a chair?
What's all this?

276
00:27:38,282 --> 00:27:42,048
Wearing shorts and half a vest...
are you trying to expose yourself?

277
00:27:42,353 --> 00:27:44,844
Even I am seeing and
observing everything.

278
00:27:45,089 --> 00:27:48,081
You are closing the door to save your
prestige? You should've been cautious

279
00:27:48,324 --> 00:27:50,315
What did you say?
- You should've been cautious.

280
00:27:55,465 --> 00:27:58,400
Did I hit you?
Then why are you crying?

281
00:27:58,534 --> 00:28:00,126
You may hit...

282
00:28:02,404 --> 00:28:05,805
Why are you screaming in advance?
- What if I am unable to later.

283
00:28:06,041 --> 00:28:09,238
What's your problem?
The room is not neat, right?

284
00:28:09,377 --> 00:28:11,470
Why are you cribbing about it?
Arrange it the way you want to.

285
00:28:11,612 --> 00:28:12,874
Where should the shoes be?
- On the stand.

286
00:28:13,047 --> 00:28:14,036
Socks?
- With the shoes

287
00:28:14,182 --> 00:28:14,978
Underwear?
- Can be anywhere.

288
00:28:15,116 --> 00:28:16,105
You?
- Should be in control.

289
00:28:16,417 --> 00:28:20,183
You are a good guy. Now I'm going
for a bath... in the meantime...

290
00:28:20,320 --> 00:28:24,882
I'll clean the room.
- It's just a belt, hold it.

291
00:28:34,400 --> 00:28:35,424
Take this.
- I don't want it, sir.

292
00:28:35,601 --> 00:28:38,866
It's not for you, but for 2 cigarettes.
- Okay sir

293
00:28:39,004 --> 00:28:41,097
If anybody knows about this, then?
- You'll whack me with the belt...

294
00:28:41,439 --> 00:28:43,373
No, I'll whack you to death.

295
00:28:57,521 --> 00:29:00,388
Even this is for us?
- Sign it and give it back to me.

296
00:29:13,902 --> 00:29:15,369
Who is in Ankapalli?

297
00:29:16,538 --> 00:29:19,871
We'll open and read this
- It is not good manners

298
00:29:20,308 --> 00:29:22,902
I know that. But I don't
have any manners. Come!

299
00:29:32,286 --> 00:29:36,154
If my father comes to know...?
- Will I write here, we've read it?

300
00:29:44,630 --> 00:29:49,033
Such a big letter!
He is writing since ages!

301
00:29:50,102 --> 00:29:52,935
"Dear Sreenu...
- Sorry I couldn't attend your..."

302
00:29:53,071 --> 00:29:56,939
"daughter's engagement as I was busy.
I'll not miss her marriage."

303
00:29:57,041 --> 00:30:05,915
"That day I feared for your phone bills
regarding Venkateshwarulu's mischief"

304
00:30:08,885 --> 00:30:15,848
"Hence I am writing this letter.
He is the silliest guy on earth"

305
00:30:18,527 --> 00:30:24,864
"After his mother died at an early age
I pampered him too much and spoilt him"

306
00:30:26,367 --> 00:30:28,858
"I'll narrate my experiences..
One day..."

307
00:30:29,671 --> 00:30:35,610
Please have coffee.
- He seems very clever.

308
00:30:35,876 --> 00:30:37,935
He has inherited it from his father

309
00:30:38,045 --> 00:30:43,142
No doubt, he'll be an engineer and
will make the headlines in newspapers.

310
00:30:43,317 --> 00:30:46,878
What's it daddy?
- Come here.

311
00:30:48,554 --> 00:30:52,456
Come, my beloved son.
- Ambitious to be doctor or engineer?

312
00:30:52,992 --> 00:30:55,586
I'll be a cycle mechanic.

313
00:31:03,435 --> 00:31:08,065
"Since that day he is been giving
shocks... and I've got used it."

314
00:31:08,239 --> 00:31:10,571
"One night, it so happened that..."

315
00:31:11,342 --> 00:31:14,743
Without dreams, we can't live.
Without bribes, we can't get a job

316
00:31:14,912 --> 00:31:16,379
But why do you give cigarettes
without a matchstick?

317
00:31:16,513 --> 00:31:18,572
Then ask somebody...

318
00:31:22,418 --> 00:31:25,251
Hey, Mr. do you have a matchbox?

319
00:31:38,233 --> 00:31:39,325
Daddy...?

320
00:31:51,945 --> 00:31:52,934
Read next...

321
00:31:55,348 --> 00:32:01,014
"The worst was yet to begin. His B.A
exams I worked hard for his exams"

322
00:32:01,120 --> 00:32:04,283
"I had been so serious for my exams,
I would've been a collector!"

323
00:32:04,456 --> 00:32:08,620
On that day it was History...
which is a big mystery for him!

324
00:32:11,129 --> 00:32:12,960
What's this?

325
00:32:27,678 --> 00:32:30,340
My God! They are writing so much...?

326
00:33:00,674 --> 00:33:04,667
"I don't say anything to him.
He is my strength and weakness"

327
00:33:05,178 --> 00:33:08,739
"If he is away from me then
maybe he'll become something"

328
00:33:09,182 --> 00:33:14,347
"I want him to get a decent executive
job, but he wants to be farmer"

329
00:33:14,520 --> 00:33:18,251
"Teach computers and send him abroad.
If not at least send him to Pakistan"

330
00:33:18,457 --> 00:33:22,188
"And I can proudly say, my son is
abroad. God will bless you for that"

331
00:33:22,361 --> 00:33:24,352
"That's it for now.
With love - Shekar"

332
00:33:28,699 --> 00:33:32,100
Come, it's okay come

333
00:33:46,049 --> 00:33:48,745
Do you paint?
- Once in a while.

334
00:33:49,218 --> 00:33:52,381
Sister, the dog is beautiful. Isn't it?
- It's not a dog, it is a horse.

335
00:33:52,554 --> 00:33:53,543
Horse?

336
00:33:53,789 --> 00:33:55,780
Don't you know, some horses
look like dogs!

337
00:33:56,225 --> 00:33:59,388
We came to know about you just today.
We thought you were only a guest.

338
00:33:59,727 --> 00:34:02,719
My aunty says, you are
good at many things

339
00:34:03,398 --> 00:34:04,387
How nice of her!

340
00:34:09,302 --> 00:34:14,171
Forgotten the pincode?
- She is Nandini, fondly called Nandu.

341
00:34:14,307 --> 00:34:17,242
She has finished her B.Sc last year,
this year she is getting married

342
00:34:17,411 --> 00:34:20,608
What are you planning for next year?
- Forget ours, tell us about you.

343
00:34:21,414 --> 00:34:22,403
Is it your complete name?

344
00:34:24,183 --> 00:34:25,650
What do you want to be in life?

345
00:34:29,854 --> 00:34:32,084
Since childhood I have a dream

346
00:34:32,223 --> 00:34:36,125
After clearing my IAS exams, I was
appointed in the collector's office

347
00:34:36,294 --> 00:34:39,786
When I was at a video conference with
the minister Chandrababu Naidu...

348
00:34:40,364 --> 00:34:43,822
my father came there but the
attendant told him I was busy

349
00:34:44,501 --> 00:34:48,369
My father had to wait for me in the
verandah, and when I saw him...

350
00:34:48,539 --> 00:34:53,272
and when I saw him through the window,
I couldn't digest this fact

351
00:34:55,111 --> 00:34:59,673
I told him my father is waiting for
me outside. Hence I terminated my...

352
00:34:59,749 --> 00:35:06,951
...session and went to my father
and begged for forgiveness...

353
00:35:07,456 --> 00:35:14,453
He couldn't control his emotion and
tears rolled down his cheeks.

354
00:35:14,628 --> 00:35:19,224
He was so happy,
he just hugged me.

355
00:35:19,600 --> 00:35:20,931
Who is it?
- Boss...

356
00:35:21,202 --> 00:35:22,726
...is here?
- Wants you to be there?

357
00:35:23,169 --> 00:35:28,300
I'll be there.
The remaining will be continued later

358
00:35:37,816 --> 00:35:43,482
Come in.
- You know what is this?

359
00:35:44,489 --> 00:35:45,922
Book.
- Letter

360
00:35:46,390 --> 00:35:48,153
Letter?
- Yes, your father has written it.

361
00:35:49,727 --> 00:35:54,460
Because to narrate your mischief
would cost him heavy phone bills.

362
00:35:55,265 --> 00:35:59,599
What do you think you are?
- IAS, IPS officer...

363
00:36:02,205 --> 00:36:05,402
No,... I'm ready for any small job

364
00:36:07,476 --> 00:36:11,173
I had thought, a job for you
would solve the problem

365
00:36:11,514 --> 00:36:13,505
But after reading the letter...
I have changed my mind.

366
00:36:15,683 --> 00:36:18,777
More than a job, you need education
- Yes, uncle.

367
00:36:20,922 --> 00:36:23,322
Don't bring your smart talks here.

368
00:36:24,425 --> 00:36:26,518
I'm not as good as your father
- I know that.

369
00:36:28,228 --> 00:36:30,355
I didn't mean to say...
- This is it...

370
00:36:30,597 --> 00:36:33,191
Better correct yourself.
Now you can leave.

371
00:36:49,948 --> 00:36:53,315
What do you want to be?
- I am dreamer.

372
00:36:53,485 --> 00:36:56,477
If you sleep more you'll stay there.
- Don't disturb me.

373
00:36:56,721 --> 00:36:59,019
"When my father had come
to the Collector's office"

374
00:36:59,223 --> 00:37:01,248
"And when I was playing video games
with Sonia Gandhi"

375
00:37:01,559 --> 00:37:04,289
Not video games! It's video conference
- Whatever it is

376
00:37:04,428 --> 00:37:05,952
Then what happened Venkateshwarulu?

377
00:37:13,503 --> 00:37:16,802
Why did you stop?
Continue

378
00:37:18,907 --> 00:37:23,606
Was it a crime to dream, me being a
collector? Don't I've any freedom?

379
00:37:25,347 --> 00:37:31,911
Yes, I've said it. I took 4 years to
be a graduate but do you know why?

380
00:37:32,420 --> 00:37:37,881
Think about it Nandini. Do you know
to cook or know where the kitchen is?

381
00:37:39,392 --> 00:37:42,691
But I have preparing food for
my father from the past 20 years

382
00:37:43,430 --> 00:37:48,265
I lost my mother so I used to prepare
breakfast lunch, then leave for school

383
00:37:48,368 --> 00:37:51,633
After returning again, prepare
dinner and wash the dishes.

384
00:37:51,770 --> 00:37:54,534
Now where do I have time to study
or to be an officer?

385
00:37:55,274 --> 00:38:00,302
You don't understand all this,
you know to joke and make us cry.

386
00:38:01,613 --> 00:38:04,605
If this the way of fun,then I'll come
to your house and cry the whole day

387
00:38:05,783 --> 00:38:07,751
Have fun!
Great fun!

388
00:38:14,891 --> 00:38:18,349
One day or the other,
you'll be a magistrate.

389
00:38:19,396 --> 00:38:21,887
Why is he being so sentimental?

390
00:38:31,741 --> 00:38:33,641
It's me
- How are you my son?

391
00:38:33,875 --> 00:38:37,811
Do you have brains? Like Gandhiji's
biography, you've written pages

392
00:38:38,380 --> 00:38:39,870
It's not like that...
- Don't interrupt.

393
00:38:41,316 --> 00:38:45,412
Should you tell him
how I cleared my exams.

394
00:38:46,320 --> 00:38:50,017
Did he say anything?
- I lost face in front of girls.

395
00:38:50,891 --> 00:38:53,826
Shall I write another letter saying,
matter in previous letter was fake?

396
00:38:53,993 --> 00:38:58,327
I'll be finished. Daddy,
if you want write stories...

397
00:38:58,464 --> 00:39:00,659
but never write letters to him,
I'm disconnecting now.

398
00:39:17,348 --> 00:39:22,047
I made you cry very badly...
- It's the fate of a motherless child.

399
00:39:22,687 --> 00:39:23,711
It's okay.

400
00:39:37,533 --> 00:39:38,830
So... serious?

401
00:39:38,901 --> 00:39:41,131
What does Pinky drink everyday?

402
00:39:45,541 --> 00:39:48,806
Look how she is seeing.
- Because she can't see properly

403
00:39:50,511 --> 00:39:53,139
If you are hungry, eat chocolates
not nails

404
00:39:56,050 --> 00:40:00,987
Your temper is rising?
Then you shouldn't be like this

405
00:40:01,788 --> 00:40:08,193
Go straight to him and make
your fist like this and hit his ribs

406
00:40:08,661 --> 00:40:10,652
He'll not climb the school bus
but will go in an ambulance

407
00:40:10,730 --> 00:40:14,029
Should I really do that?
- Hit hard. I'll take care.

408
00:40:58,106 --> 00:41:01,667
You all are praying?
- You can start having.

409
00:41:10,850 --> 00:41:13,876
Don't you have the habit
of praying before dinner?

410
00:41:15,522 --> 00:41:19,083
I say my prayers.
- Prayers? Learn from him.

411
00:41:19,292 --> 00:41:23,695
Pray again.
- I've already finished in my house.

412
00:41:23,962 --> 00:41:25,759
No problem, do it again.
- I'll take lot of time...

413
00:41:25,998 --> 00:41:27,260
No problem, we'll wait

414
00:41:28,534 --> 00:41:30,229
Is it necessary?
- Why don't you know?

415
00:41:35,673 --> 00:41:38,870
God, Oh good Lord,

416
00:41:40,178 --> 00:41:47,175
To eat you have given us...
eggplant curry, fried rice

417
00:41:47,317 --> 00:41:54,951
And in our state, 7 million
people also must be given

418
00:41:55,291 --> 00:41:57,191
And in our country, 90 million
people also must be given

419
00:41:59,495 --> 00:42:06,526
And in the world... I don't
know the exact number

420
00:42:07,502 --> 00:42:12,838
They should also be given food. If
not same, at least give what they eat

421
00:42:18,745 --> 00:42:26,914
Everybody should be given food. I
know you'd give, because you are God

422
00:42:32,859 --> 00:42:37,887
My prayer was a bit different and new
- It was not new, it sounded dead!

423
00:42:38,096 --> 00:42:41,725
This is not new to us, he also
writes the same kind of poems

424
00:42:42,334 --> 00:42:45,701
Difference is... you spoke to God,
he speaks about his mother.

425
00:42:47,872 --> 00:42:50,773
Really?
- Why are you bringing that now?

426
00:42:51,275 --> 00:42:54,540
I like poems with subject as mother.
- Recently, he has written a poem.

427
00:42:54,678 --> 00:42:59,012
We have heard it...
- You have, but what about Venky?

428
00:43:02,085 --> 00:43:05,680
You are making me helpless. Okay

429
00:43:29,676 --> 00:43:35,308
"Mother, I was born to you unasked.
You cared for me when I was crying"

430
00:43:36,983 --> 00:43:37,745
"When I cried you fed me.
When rains came, you gave an umbrella"

431
00:43:39,685 --> 00:43:43,212
"To play you gave me toys.
To spend you gave me money"

432
00:43:43,923 --> 00:43:47,586
"To wear you gave me clothes.
To see, you gave me beauty"

433
00:43:52,263 --> 00:43:56,063
"To write you gave me pen
To shave you gave me beard"

434
00:43:58,269 --> 00:44:05,004
"That's why I liked you but
why did you die so early?"

435
00:44:10,347 --> 00:44:14,113
"But still I like you"

436
00:44:20,122 --> 00:44:21,612
Your poem is very informative

437
00:44:26,895 --> 00:44:27,953
I was a bit emotional.

438
00:44:46,646 --> 00:44:48,307
What's your sister doing?
- She is busy in the bathroom.

439
00:44:49,182 --> 00:44:50,979
You are coming for the party?
- Why should I come?

440
00:44:52,051 --> 00:44:53,814
You'll feel bad, as all boys
will be my fans.

441
00:44:55,220 --> 00:44:57,381
Speak according to your age.
Keep the phone down

442
00:45:01,893 --> 00:45:04,987
What is it?
- I'll say after you stop exposing.

443
00:45:06,664 --> 00:45:08,063
Tell me
- Asha had called up.

444
00:45:08,199 --> 00:45:10,326
What shall we gift her?
- What do you think?

445
00:45:10,668 --> 00:45:14,661
How about a gold ring?
- On my birthday, she gave a chocolate

446
00:45:15,905 --> 00:45:19,739
Then.. a flower..?
- It looks very cheap.

447
00:45:21,011 --> 00:45:21,875
But who will get it for us?

448
00:45:25,180 --> 00:45:25,669
You are right.

449
00:45:29,785 --> 00:45:30,479
What's it?
- Want coffee?

450
00:45:30,786 --> 00:45:33,254
What do you want?
- Can you get a bouquet?

451
00:45:33,455 --> 00:45:35,150
For you?
- No, it's for my sister.

452
00:45:35,356 --> 00:45:39,258
One has to wash one's own clothes,
one has to get their own bouquet

453
00:45:39,694 --> 00:45:42,891
You have to get it for yourself.
- Tell him, I'll give him money

454
00:45:43,197 --> 00:45:46,189
It seems, she'll give money.
- You can't buy me with money.

455
00:45:46,700 --> 00:45:49,032
You can't buy him with money
- But you can get a bouquet

456
00:45:49,302 --> 00:45:51,270
But you can buy.
- I heard it.

457
00:45:52,039 --> 00:45:55,702
We are late for the party. If not
for my sister, get it for Asha

458
00:45:57,777 --> 00:45:59,404
The same who had visited us...
Don't you remember?

459
00:45:59,979 --> 00:46:02,470
How can I forget?
- Today is her Birthday .

460
00:46:02,882 --> 00:46:04,850
Why didn't you say that before?
Where's the party?

461
00:46:07,886 --> 00:46:11,049
Forget it, we'll pick it on the way.
- He agreed to get it.

462
00:46:12,791 --> 00:46:14,952
What happened?
- Looking at your sister's hairstyle...

463
00:46:17,395 --> 00:46:20,523
Instead of tying it back, why don't
you leave your hair down

464
00:46:24,068 --> 00:46:25,330
I just told you as a friend.

465
00:46:28,138 --> 00:46:30,402
Why hasn't he come yet?
- Why did you call him here?

466
00:46:30,840 --> 00:46:33,741
Why?
-If one girl can make his heart throb

467
00:46:33,876 --> 00:46:36,902
...just imagine his condition
with so many girls around?

468
00:46:42,984 --> 00:46:44,576
I am looking good..!

469
00:46:56,931 --> 00:46:59,866
Look at the way he is coming.
- Why so late?

470
00:47:00,066 --> 00:47:03,524
I had to collect my coat from the
laundry. It looks good for the party

471
00:47:05,271 --> 00:47:06,499
Now it's good.
Let's go

472
00:47:07,273 --> 00:47:07,932
Where to?
- Inside.

473
00:47:08,374 --> 00:47:10,308
You may leave
- I'll have to wish Asha.

474
00:47:10,477 --> 00:47:14,573
I'll wish her on behalf of you.
- She'll feel bad if I don't wish her

475
00:47:15,180 --> 00:47:16,442
I know she won't feel bad, now leave.
- Just ask her once.

476
00:47:17,883 --> 00:47:20,818
You have done enough on the day
she visited our house.

477
00:47:21,120 --> 00:47:23,782
What did I do?
- You were in those shorts...

478
00:47:24,021 --> 00:47:25,488
and acted crazily.
You think I haven't seen it?

479
00:47:25,857 --> 00:47:29,793
I was acting crazy? You think
your friend is Miss World?

480
00:47:29,961 --> 00:47:33,419
Just watch how she'll go crazy for me
- You can't do it.

481
00:47:33,597 --> 00:47:34,962
Challenge?
- Yes

482
00:47:40,303 --> 00:47:44,239
Why so late?
Come in, the party has started.

483
00:47:48,244 --> 00:47:49,871
Have you skipped your classes today?

484
00:48:16,502 --> 00:48:20,905
I am observing that you are running
away from me as if I am your enemy.

485
00:48:23,342 --> 00:48:26,175
I don't know you at all, you are
neither invited for the party

486
00:48:26,344 --> 00:48:30,144
But since you have come,
I am treating you as guest

487
00:48:30,315 --> 00:48:33,148
Why are you running away like this?
If I sit next to you, You move away...

488
00:48:33,318 --> 00:48:34,342
What do you think of yourself?

489
00:48:36,020 --> 00:48:38,648
I have the courage to tell you but
do you the strength to face it?

490
00:48:40,357 --> 00:48:43,485
I can't talk very smooth,
I can speak very straight

491
00:48:45,029 --> 00:48:47,156
I fell for you the day I saw you

492
00:48:49,332 --> 00:48:53,996
I am here for the party just to
have a glimpse of you

493
00:48:57,573 --> 00:49:01,532
You know why I got up from my seat?
I don't deserve to be seated beside you

494
00:49:03,545 --> 00:49:09,415
I'm unable to control myself.
If you are near me... I feel scared...

495
00:49:09,684 --> 00:49:11,208
That's why... I run away from you

496
00:49:14,288 --> 00:49:20,386
Please don't look at me like this
I can't bear it.

497
00:50:04,433 --> 00:50:07,527
"Charming star in the sky"

498
00:50:09,071 --> 00:50:12,768
"It takes me a lifetime
to reach you"

499
00:50:14,175 --> 00:50:15,472
"My dreams..."

500
00:50:16,678 --> 00:50:18,009
"Your beauty..."

501
00:50:19,447 --> 00:50:23,110
"makes me sing the song of love
from my heart"

502
00:50:24,218 --> 00:50:27,881
"My dear is this true?"

503
00:50:29,256 --> 00:50:32,987
"My dear, is this meeting
a boon for us?"

504
00:50:33,926 --> 00:50:38,522
"Our separation will
give intense pain to me"

505
00:51:31,078 --> 00:51:35,981
"I feel as though I am in a mist"

506
00:51:38,718 --> 00:51:43,587
"Who knows where this
bondage will lead us?"

507
00:51:46,292 --> 00:51:50,729
"My heart started trembling
looking into your eyes"

508
00:51:51,697 --> 00:51:55,895
"To win your heart and trust,
I'll go to any heights"

509
00:51:56,168 --> 00:52:01,333
"My desire is to be
your lover forever"

510
00:52:01,773 --> 00:52:06,073
"And people are envying
my love to you"

511
00:52:06,210 --> 00:52:10,203
"My dear, please respond to me"

512
00:52:11,882 --> 00:52:16,342
"Your beauty is like the
beautiful moonlight"

513
00:52:17,054 --> 00:52:21,753
"My life can reach eternity
with your love"

514
00:53:00,993 --> 00:53:05,259
"You are like the blooming
jasmine in the spring

515
00:53:08,700 --> 00:53:13,399
"You dance like a peacock"

516
00:53:16,173 --> 00:53:20,803
"I am overwhelmed by your sweet
smile and gracious walk"

517
00:53:21,611 --> 00:53:25,707
"You are one of
God's best creations"

518
00:53:26,783 --> 00:53:31,083
"I am longing for your love"

519
00:53:31,287 --> 00:53:35,348
"I'll worship your love"

520
00:53:36,358 --> 00:53:39,953
"My dear, please agree..."

521
00:53:41,864 --> 00:53:46,028
"and save me from the intense pain"

522
00:53:46,968 --> 00:53:51,132
"Please grant me life by
accepting my love to you"

523
00:54:36,408 --> 00:54:39,605
Why are you standing here?
- Asha is looking for you inside

524
00:54:39,778 --> 00:54:41,575
Why?
- Her daddy is on the line and...

525
00:54:41,747 --> 00:54:44,181
wants to have a word with you
- With me? What is there to talk?

526
00:54:44,416 --> 00:54:46,714
It could be your marriage or
honeymoon. What do I know?

527
00:54:47,251 --> 00:54:51,813
Don't scare me, it was for fun, don't
speak of marriage and spoil my life

528
00:54:52,189 --> 00:54:54,384
You would have done it for bets
but Asha is very emotional

529
00:54:54,625 --> 00:54:58,755
If in case anything goes against
her, she will commit suicide

530
00:54:59,129 --> 00:55:01,290
Why didn't you inform me about
her habits prior to this?

531
00:55:01,598 --> 00:55:04,567
Asha is waiting for you.
- Tell her he has left.

532
00:55:05,602 --> 00:55:08,298
What shall I tell Asha?
- Tell her anything.

533
00:55:08,504 --> 00:55:12,565
Tell me what should I say?
Tell her I am married and have 2 kids

534
00:55:23,751 --> 00:55:26,242
How many times should I call you,
are you deaf?

535
00:55:30,857 --> 00:55:33,690
What are you doing inside, are you
preparing for your husband?

536
00:55:35,862 --> 00:55:40,629
You don't have discipline at all.
She is back from a late night party...

537
00:55:40,800 --> 00:55:42,791
don't you have sense to give
her a bed coffee?

538
00:55:44,303 --> 00:55:46,669
You are always worried about your
husband and never about us

539
00:55:48,240 --> 00:55:53,177
It's not your mistake anyway, he's
always after rules and regulations

540
00:55:56,548 --> 00:55:58,607
Why are you like this uncle?
Aren't you feeling well?

541
00:55:58,783 --> 00:56:01,411
Yes, I'm a bit tensed.
There's whisky in daddy's room.

542
00:56:01,618 --> 00:56:07,420
Have it. It will help you relax.
What is it still...?

543
00:56:16,899 --> 00:56:19,663
By this time you would have
left for office...

544
00:56:19,802 --> 00:56:25,206
I was busy with the accountant.
Tomorrow I'll leave on time.

545
00:56:27,843 --> 00:56:30,641
Why are you still here...?
Go and get her the bed coffee

546
00:56:34,181 --> 00:56:36,843
You've got up late and worse,
you are reading a newspaper

547
00:56:37,618 --> 00:56:41,452
What did you say, she doesn't have
discipline? How about you?

548
00:56:42,655 --> 00:56:44,623
If you behave like this, after
marriage they will not scold you

549
00:56:45,358 --> 00:56:47,417
But they will speak ill about
your mother and myself

550
00:56:48,194 --> 00:56:49,786
She is telling my brother
to have whisky...?

551
00:56:49,963 --> 00:56:52,989
She is innocent and even if she
says, will I have that brand?

552
00:56:55,334 --> 00:56:59,600
At least learn from your sister, even
she was also there in the party...

553
00:56:59,771 --> 00:57:00,829
but she has already gone to school

554
00:57:01,206 --> 00:57:04,369
Aunty, complain...

555
00:57:09,480 --> 00:57:14,008
Shameless laughs! Once again if you
talk of parties, I'll break your legs.

556
00:57:14,317 --> 00:57:16,717
Brother, why are you all so serious?

557
00:57:17,287 --> 00:57:18,982
You should have called me, I would
have picked you up at the station

558
00:57:19,356 --> 00:57:23,019
I thought about it, then I thought
of giving you all a surprise

559
00:57:23,360 --> 00:57:28,457
Keep this aside, come here...
- Any American news?

560
00:57:28,797 --> 00:57:32,233
I will not speak to you.
- You are so angry...?

561
00:57:32,401 --> 00:57:38,237
No, we felt happy
We were expecting you so eagerly.

562
00:57:39,607 --> 00:57:42,371
If you don't turn up for such an
important function, won't we feel bad?

563
00:57:42,577 --> 00:57:45,444
I tried my level best to be here but...

564
00:57:45,579 --> 00:57:48,343
Since my mother-in-law was ill
and I had to take care of her

565
00:57:48,515 --> 00:57:53,885
Admit her to hospital permanently, so
young doctors may experiment on her

566
00:57:54,021 --> 00:57:55,750
Brother
- You stop it.

567
00:57:56,656 --> 00:57:59,056
My sister has come from so far, are
you thinking to offer her something?

568
00:57:59,392 --> 00:58:02,418
I'll give it, don't remind
me of my duties

569
00:58:04,664 --> 00:58:07,758
What is it?
- Brother I couldn't make it up...

570
00:58:08,967 --> 00:58:13,597
Do you need to tell me? I know how
bad you feel for missing the ceremony

571
00:58:14,773 --> 00:58:21,611
Your presence there is a requirement.
Here it's boon for us

572
00:58:35,325 --> 00:58:36,314
What are you reading?

573
00:58:39,528 --> 00:58:43,430
This book is more important than me?
- Engagement wasn't important to you?

574
00:58:43,498 --> 00:58:45,625
It's not that...
I have anger till here

575
00:58:45,767 --> 00:58:50,727
You disappointed me and now you are
questioning me about your importance?

576
00:58:51,472 --> 00:58:55,841
Since childhood, you know how much I
like you but you hardly care for me.

577
00:59:01,448 --> 00:59:06,078
Did I hurt you?
- No, it's me who has hurt you all

578
00:59:08,421 --> 00:59:11,857
Nandu, you don't know the life after
marriage. It's full of problems

579
00:59:14,960 --> 00:59:20,330
Life becomes full of compromises, we
have to live on excuses, permissions

580
00:59:21,566 --> 00:59:26,401
How sarcastic life is! We can't be
with our parents as we were before

581
00:59:26,671 --> 00:59:28,764
Why your he is not looking
after you well?

582
00:59:28,940 --> 00:59:36,676
He is neither bad nor good,
he is a man that is all

583
00:59:38,415 --> 00:59:44,115
Do you believe this? He hasn't asked
me till date if I have had food?

584
00:59:44,453 --> 00:59:51,484
Why is that you haven't told all this?
- It's better forgotten than remembered

585
00:59:53,862 --> 00:59:54,988
I don't really understand something

586
00:59:56,698 --> 01:00:01,101
If they want to send a kid outside,
they send with only known people

587
01:00:02,404 --> 01:00:04,838
If they go for a movie, then
they go with persons known to us

588
01:00:05,773 --> 01:00:11,507
If they have to be away, they arrange
for a hostel or a family they know.

589
01:00:12,880 --> 01:00:17,044
Like this in every step of our lives,
we are with people known to us

590
01:00:17,150 --> 01:00:26,650
But in marriage, they marry us to
a person whom we hardly know

591
01:00:28,927 --> 01:00:37,392
After the marriage we move
far away from our dear ones

592
01:00:39,837 --> 01:00:45,833
We will be treated as a machine
which gives birth to a child.

593
01:00:47,977 --> 01:00:56,783
After marriage, house changes,
names changes. Why not her heart?

594
01:00:58,420 --> 01:01:04,620
Why is that she can't stop
dreaming about you all?

595
01:01:06,462 --> 01:01:19,671
Why should thoughts of our parents
torture us and make us cry?

596
01:01:20,674 --> 01:01:25,634
Why is this marriage?
Why should we take birth as women?

597
01:01:40,658 --> 01:01:44,560
Are you a beauty queen to show your
face in the morning? Keep it there.

598
01:01:49,933 --> 01:01:52,731
Please move.
- You are coming from out house?

599
01:01:52,936 --> 01:01:56,531
He thinks he'll have a nice day if
he sees my face early in the morning

600
01:01:56,707 --> 01:02:01,144
But I feel not to leave way for
stupid people early in the morning

601
01:02:01,577 --> 01:02:02,601
But I do give way.

602
01:02:10,786 --> 01:02:12,481
Were you in love with anybody?

603
01:02:13,088 --> 01:02:14,578
You could find no one but me to
question about it!

604
01:02:15,590 --> 01:02:16,614
I am asking you seriously.

605
01:02:18,994 --> 01:02:22,657
Yes you have. Who is he?
- I don't know his name.

606
01:02:23,597 --> 01:02:26,157
Earlier, in my college days..
he used to stand near the corner

607
01:02:27,001 --> 01:02:29,231
What was he doing?
- He used to look at me and smile

608
01:02:31,671 --> 01:02:36,506
That's all...?
- It took him a year to do so.

609
01:02:38,011 --> 01:02:47,147
Then...?
- I got engaged and never saw him again

610
01:02:49,154 --> 01:02:53,750
Coward! He was scared of my father
and so he ran away.

611
01:02:54,025 --> 01:02:57,119
Had I revealed it, it would've
created a havoc in the family

612
01:02:57,295 --> 01:03:00,093
Only after you reveal, you'll know if
it would've created a havoc or not

613
01:03:00,331 --> 01:03:02,595
You are teasing me because I didn't
dare to speak about it?

614
01:03:02,767 --> 01:03:07,568
No. I meant to say that if I am in
love, I'll inform my parents about it

615
01:03:07,771 --> 01:03:09,705
Now you don't have that chance.

616
01:03:30,792 --> 01:03:33,693
Who is he?
- Venky, a wastrel from Anakapalli

617
01:03:34,162 --> 01:03:36,756
His father couldn't handle him
and hence he is here

618
01:03:38,765 --> 01:03:43,293
I am a wastrel? How could she say
that about someone so handsome?

619
01:03:44,238 --> 01:03:48,038
How dare she? Why she had to say
that my father has sent me here?

620
01:03:48,774 --> 01:03:49,968
Do you think she is innocent?

621
01:03:50,877 --> 01:03:55,075
Did I tell anybody what she did
to her fiance the other day?

622
01:03:57,816 --> 01:04:00,148
When your aunty asked about me,
couldn't she say he is a good guy...

623
01:04:00,652 --> 01:04:03,018
Once in a while he smokes and drinks

624
01:04:03,255 --> 01:04:05,746
What would she lose in saying
that he doesn't have any bad habits?

625
01:04:06,757 --> 01:04:12,127
She is very arrogant.
Venky doesn't tolerate such acts.

626
01:04:13,097 --> 01:04:18,057
I'll not tell you how I'll avenge her.
Only if I know I can say it!

627
01:04:19,168 --> 01:04:22,035
I am basically a villain!
I don't like heroines

628
01:04:29,645 --> 01:04:31,272
Who are you?
I am Prasad here.

629
01:04:32,314 --> 01:04:34,179
I'm speaking from a STD phone
booth next to the White House

630
01:04:34,316 --> 01:04:36,113
Are you speaking from America?

631
01:04:39,687 --> 01:04:41,120
I didn't recognise.

632
01:04:41,188 --> 01:04:44,715
It's okay, I came out of the loo
and remembered you

633
01:04:46,360 --> 01:04:50,421
During our engagement,
that tall and handsome guy...

634
01:04:53,133 --> 01:04:54,122
Is he from Ankapalli?
- Yes.

635
01:04:55,635 --> 01:04:57,102
I came to know about him just now.
- What is it?

636
01:04:57,804 --> 01:05:02,138
He is a great fellow. He helped my
friend financially to go to America

637
01:05:02,374 --> 01:05:04,399
Also, he had been to
the airport to see him off!

638
01:05:04,743 --> 01:05:06,404
He is such a good man.

639
01:05:08,781 --> 01:05:12,273
You won't believe it, he offers
flowers to his photo..!

640
01:05:12,850 --> 01:05:14,374
If you offer flowers to a photo
then the person is dead, right?

641
01:05:14,852 --> 01:05:17,719
No it's not that, what I meant was,
he worships him as if he is God

642
01:05:26,897 --> 01:05:31,061
You don't know how great he is...
He doesn't know how great he is.

643
01:05:31,901 --> 01:05:35,860
I will be blessed if I see him, and
if you see him take his blessings.

644
01:05:38,674 --> 01:05:40,938
Wish him "Good morning"
and "good night" every day

645
01:05:45,847 --> 01:05:49,749
Daddy, I'll call you later.

646
01:05:51,386 --> 01:05:54,287
You are for the phone? Take it.
- Are you a human?

647
01:05:55,356 --> 01:05:57,153
Don't you have sense how
to speak to a girl?

648
01:05:58,859 --> 01:06:02,488
Don't you know there is a limit to
everything? You don't know anything!

649
01:06:03,863 --> 01:06:08,197
You... It's not your but my daddy's
mistake to have you around here.

650
01:06:08,368 --> 01:06:10,427
It's not that...
- Another word and I'll kill you

651
01:06:31,422 --> 01:06:32,389
Don't worry, I'll get it for you.

652
01:06:40,230 --> 01:06:40,958
At least you give me that bag.

653
01:06:41,331 --> 01:06:43,458
I've carried heavier weights than
this. It's not heavy for me.

654
01:06:47,803 --> 01:06:49,771
Don't mind, shall I say something?
- Tell me

655
01:06:50,472 --> 01:06:55,375
Why do you smoke so much? Reduce it.
- I smoke once in a while. That's it

656
01:06:56,811 --> 01:06:59,371
Don't listen to her words.
She doesn't like anything that I do

657
01:06:59,747 --> 01:07:01,806
What did he say?
- Nothing.

658
01:07:02,083 --> 01:07:03,550
You don't have to support him.
Tell me what did he say?

659
01:07:03,885 --> 01:07:07,821
See, what I just told you
- Have guts, speak to me not to her.

660
01:07:08,021 --> 01:07:11,081
Oh my God, I am scared.
- I'll break your teeth!

661
01:07:11,925 --> 01:07:14,359
Why do speak to him like that?
- Advise her that.

662
01:07:14,494 --> 01:07:16,223
If you speak about advise,
I'll slit your tongue

663
01:07:16,396 --> 01:07:19,854
Yesterday on phone, he mimicked a
man from America and spoke rubbish

664
01:07:20,032 --> 01:07:21,556
Yes I spoke, but do you know why?

665
01:07:21,867 --> 01:07:26,463
Tell me on that day what did she say
to you? I won't mind, tell me.

666
01:07:26,806 --> 01:07:28,433
Why do you bring that up now?
- That is very important.

667
01:07:28,807 --> 01:07:31,537
She said I am a wastrel, I'm here
because my father couldn't handle me?

668
01:07:31,843 --> 01:07:34,209
I am living off their earnings.
- I didn't say that.

669
01:07:34,345 --> 01:07:37,940
You said it indirectly. You mean
thousand things in just one word

670
01:07:38,182 --> 01:07:40,514
It's pointless talking to you.
You don't have any manners also.

671
01:07:40,851 --> 01:07:44,287
If you would have had manners then
why did you read my father's letter?

672
01:07:44,488 --> 01:07:51,360
You have lied to us that your
ambition was to be a collector.

673
01:07:51,961 --> 01:07:54,896
Did I say so?
- She is lying, don't believe her.

674
01:07:55,198 --> 01:07:59,294
You know his original name?
- Don't bring my personal matters here.

675
01:07:59,434 --> 01:08:00,901
It's the name of God. He'll turn
you blind, if you make fun of it

676
01:08:03,071 --> 01:08:05,539
Don't take her seriously.
I am not as she has described me.

677
01:08:05,841 --> 01:08:09,072
No. He is like that.
- I'll give a call

678
01:08:10,444 --> 01:08:13,971
Who'll take you seriously?
He spoilt my mood.

679
01:08:14,148 --> 01:08:16,582
You have great moods, hence you
keep your face like this

680
01:08:16,851 --> 01:08:20,446
You...
- What will you do?

681
01:08:20,820 --> 01:08:22,515
If I give a shock, you'll
be shaken completely.

682
01:08:23,223 --> 01:08:24,554
Where is the ticket?
- She gave you.

683
01:08:24,824 --> 01:08:27,258
It was her ticket!
- My ticket?

684
01:08:28,128 --> 01:08:31,586
Who are you?
- We can fight later on, my ticket?

685
01:08:31,897 --> 01:08:33,831
Sort out your conflicts later on.
Give me your tickets

686
01:08:33,932 --> 01:08:36,526
We were together, we were
here to leave her aunty.

687
01:08:36,835 --> 01:08:39,326
You've bright future as a writer.
Now, show your tickets.

688
01:08:39,838 --> 01:08:42,170
I'm telling you the truth.
- Why, you don't have tickets?

689
01:08:42,907 --> 01:08:46,172
The ticketless will be punished with
6 months jail or fine of Rs.500

690
01:08:46,344 --> 01:08:50,405
If I give you the money?
- Bribing leads to double punishment.

691
01:08:50,515 --> 01:08:54,315
Sir, I will pay the fine now.
- The fine should be paid in Court.

692
01:08:59,956 --> 01:09:01,514
Spoke about bribe but accepted Rs.100

693
01:09:03,425 --> 01:09:04,585
Buy the tickets lady,
the ticket collector is there!

694
01:09:07,863 --> 01:09:14,098
Move! Why that smile? You thought
one ticket is for the entire family?

695
01:09:14,269 --> 01:09:15,668
I am from Ankapalli, but at least you
should have known being in this city

696
01:09:18,606 --> 01:09:20,130
What's it?
- Your platform ticket.

697
01:09:20,308 --> 01:09:21,366
My platform ticket?

698
01:09:36,656 --> 01:09:38,886
Okay, even I will have my day.

699
01:10:00,911 --> 01:10:03,243
Monday morning there's an interview
in my friend's office. Be there.

700
01:10:03,380 --> 01:10:03,971
Okay.

701
01:10:19,428 --> 01:10:20,417
I can never understand her.

702
01:10:25,033 --> 01:10:28,093
Take this.
- Why did you wash? I am here for it

703
01:10:28,502 --> 01:10:30,436
I didn't wash, I've just eaten.
You can wash it.

704
01:10:33,107 --> 01:10:34,665
Why to wash? Wastage of soap.

705
01:10:39,946 --> 01:10:42,608
You called only one name, but 3
arrived, this is the custom

706
01:10:42,716 --> 01:10:45,310
But Murty didn't arrive
- That's also a customer

707
01:10:45,485 --> 01:10:49,080
Where is Murthy?
- He is has gone for a function

708
01:10:49,555 --> 01:10:51,318
You?
- We are on behalf of the bridegroom

709
01:10:51,490 --> 01:10:56,257
It means...?
- We are relatives.

710
01:10:57,663 --> 01:11:03,966
I am bridegroom's father's uncle's
father's cousin's son.

711
01:11:04,435 --> 01:11:10,101
He was lucky to get married to my
sister and I'm his brother-in-law.

712
01:11:10,707 --> 01:11:13,972
How are you related to the bridegroom?
- So you didn't understand?

713
01:11:14,111 --> 01:11:16,739
I am the bridegroom's...
- Can you be short and clear

714
01:11:17,047 --> 01:11:22,075
He is the uncle and I'm brother-in-law.
For it is vice-versa

715
01:11:22,985 --> 01:11:25,146
He is your brother-in-law,
and he is uncle

716
01:11:26,122 --> 01:11:30,081
She is too young for him.
- Who knows what he liked in her?

717
01:11:30,660 --> 01:11:31,684
What are you studying?

718
01:11:33,194 --> 01:11:34,183
Will you stop your studies
after marriage?

719
01:11:34,329 --> 01:11:35,318
If she is getting married,
why should I stop studying

720
01:11:36,731 --> 01:11:41,134
She is the girl who is engaged.
- She is like actress Madhuri Dixit

721
01:11:47,641 --> 01:11:49,131
Keep all this inside.
- What's this?

722
01:11:49,276 --> 01:11:51,210
They are the dress and jewellery
for the marriage

723
01:11:54,681 --> 01:11:56,444
Why have all left us?
- It's the custom.

724
01:11:56,582 --> 01:11:59,016
Maybe they don't want
to disturb the elders

725
01:12:01,621 --> 01:12:05,421
They'll not leave without lunch.
- We have even washed the vessels.

726
01:12:05,590 --> 01:12:08,753
I don't know how to cook.
- He's been cooking since childhood.

727
01:12:10,195 --> 01:12:15,360
That day I was reckless. I know
to eat what my father cooks

728
01:12:16,701 --> 01:12:17,099
What shall we do?

729
01:12:21,439 --> 01:12:22,269
Move...

730
01:12:24,207 --> 01:12:26,675
After drinking so much,
no human can have lunch

731
01:12:30,780 --> 01:12:33,340
Please have it.
- Why is all this?

732
01:12:33,550 --> 01:12:38,112
Customs! Wealthy people have juice
before lunch to increase appetite.

733
01:12:42,224 --> 01:12:44,556
Are we staying for lunch?
- You expect us to go to a hotel?

734
01:12:44,760 --> 01:12:47,786
Leaving without having lunch may
cause conflicts later on.

735
01:12:49,564 --> 01:12:50,656
So let's have it here.
- Sure why not?

736
01:12:50,765 --> 01:12:56,863
Aren't we troubling her?
- Cooking for two is nothing for her.

737
01:12:58,772 --> 01:13:04,733
The meals should be simple.
- Did I ask for a marriage feast?

738
01:13:05,078 --> 01:13:06,602
Just prepare two side dishes
with two curries.

739
01:13:06,746 --> 01:13:11,308
He has a gastric problem, don't use
onions but he can't live without apples.

740
01:13:11,517 --> 01:13:13,542
Can you have food without
any papad and pickles?

741
01:13:13,686 --> 01:13:18,646
There is no need to specify. She
knows she has to prepare all these.

742
01:13:20,091 --> 01:13:23,686
If we are reluctant in having food,
then people will speak ill of us.

743
01:13:23,862 --> 01:13:30,768
As though I am unaware about it.
- Prepare a soup for his indigestion

744
01:13:31,101 --> 01:13:34,502
Don't you have stone in your kidney?
- What should we do for that?

745
01:13:34,671 --> 01:13:41,702
He has to undergo an operation... but
give him a glass of juice after lunch.

746
01:13:43,746 --> 01:13:47,182
Their list is so big..?
- We'll do something, light the stove

747
01:13:55,624 --> 01:13:58,457
For every one minute you do this.
- Give me your watch.

748
01:13:59,427 --> 01:14:01,452
Whoever will marry you!
He will be dead.

749
01:14:02,129 --> 01:14:06,623
You are leaving me all alone?
- Don't over react. I'll be back.

750
01:14:13,473 --> 01:14:16,203
Get the listed items from a hotel.
- You just had your lunch?

751
01:14:17,644 --> 01:14:18,508
In how many minutes should I be back?

752
01:14:18,812 --> 01:14:23,806
I have a doubt. Why is there no
aroma of food being cooked?

753
01:14:25,317 --> 01:14:28,150
What happened?
- They are unable to smell the flavor.

754
01:14:28,387 --> 01:14:29,649
Move...
- What are you searching for?

755
01:14:33,324 --> 01:14:35,815
This is it.
- It's a pesticide

756
01:14:35,993 --> 01:14:41,158
I know... Now I'll cut it, I'll
hold it, and now watch...

757
01:14:45,836 --> 01:14:52,503
Can you smell the pleasant smell
of a fried chicken?

758
01:14:58,514 --> 01:15:00,505
It's getting late..
- Sir, Here it is.

759
01:15:02,517 --> 01:15:03,506
What's is all this?

760
01:15:05,420 --> 01:15:07,285
Everything is hot. Take it.

761
01:15:07,856 --> 01:15:22,760
This must be here... Now you really
look as though you have cooked.

762
01:15:27,707 --> 01:15:31,768
We are very lucky.
- Everybody isn't like your sister.

763
01:15:36,214 --> 01:15:38,774
A good lunch must be ended
with betel leaves.

764
01:15:39,885 --> 01:15:46,381
You have specially prepared it also.
- This is free with lunch from hotel.

765
01:15:49,126 --> 01:15:52,892
He meant that you needn't specify
about betel leaves.

766
01:15:54,899 --> 01:15:59,563
We'll visit again.
Convey my regards to everyone.

767
01:16:02,906 --> 01:16:05,568
Sorry, we missed the engagement.

768
01:16:05,909 --> 01:16:09,572
We'll be here 10 days prior to
marriage. Now we are getting late

769
01:16:13,749 --> 01:16:19,585
You've saved us from great trouble.
- You don't have to thank me so much.

770
01:16:21,088 --> 01:16:22,749
Go take rest.
- What about you?

771
01:16:22,924 --> 01:16:24,983
I've some work with him
regarding betel leaves

772
01:16:28,562 --> 01:16:30,086
What did you say?

773
01:16:45,945 --> 01:16:46,877
Got up now?
We have to be lucky to sleep till 9.

774
01:16:50,782 --> 01:16:51,612
Where are you going?
- For an interview

775
01:17:11,968 --> 01:17:14,459
What are you doing?
Are you watering plants or my cards?

776
01:17:14,637 --> 01:17:18,869
Everyday, you play in the club,
and still why do you play here?

777
01:17:19,475 --> 01:17:25,641
Mad fellow! Do Olympic players
relax until the next Olympics

778
01:17:26,815 --> 01:17:30,114
Does Sachin Tendulkar
stop his net practice?

779
01:17:31,485 --> 01:17:36,479
Similarly, if I don't practice in
the house, then I may lose my luck.

780
01:17:41,327 --> 01:17:44,353
What happened?
- What happened at the interview?

781
01:17:44,664 --> 01:17:45,653
They would have said sorry.

782
01:17:47,433 --> 01:17:51,927
From today my golden days have come
to an end in my life. I am selected.

783
01:18:06,517 --> 01:18:09,509
When are you giving us the party?
- Why?

784
01:18:09,687 --> 01:18:11,678
You got the job, right?
- So...?

785
01:18:11,756 --> 01:18:12,780
You'll get your salary
- If you want, take my job and pay.

786
01:18:12,923 --> 01:18:19,852
So you don't want to work?
- I don't want a job.

787
01:18:20,030 --> 01:18:25,798
I knew that from your father's letter
- Now, don't speak about the letter.

788
01:18:26,869 --> 01:18:31,863
Your father wants you to go abroad,
earn fame but you want to be a farmer

789
01:18:31,974 --> 01:18:37,037
What is wrong in it?
- You have studied to be farmer?

790
01:18:37,178 --> 01:18:44,550
So if I go abroad and earn there,
then is it right? Is it a business?

791
01:18:44,685 --> 01:18:51,056
If I go abroad, I'll earn and buy
a car, also send a snap of it...

792
01:18:51,825 --> 01:18:54,020
But can I take my father
for a ride? No.

793
01:18:54,861 --> 01:18:59,491
I'll buy a two-wheeler, take my daddy
on it. This is real happiness for me.

794
01:19:00,199 --> 01:19:04,659
If my father falls sick, from America
I can ask him if he has had any pills

795
01:19:04,804 --> 01:19:08,604
But if I can give him the pills, then
that gives me better satisfaction.

796
01:19:09,908 --> 01:19:18,179
After I lost my mother... my father
never married again. For my sake.

797
01:19:18,882 --> 01:19:23,683
He never made me feel the
pain of losing my mother...

798
01:19:23,821 --> 01:19:25,914
Is it right on my part to
leave him at his old age

799
01:19:27,090 --> 01:19:32,084
I have at least my friends,
but for him, I am his world

800
01:19:32,595 --> 01:19:38,898
He is worried about my future,
I worry about him in my absence

801
01:19:41,002 --> 01:19:44,130
Leaving the house and the place
where I spent my childhood...

802
01:19:44,272 --> 01:19:49,733
...my beloved father and dear
friends, what do I gain?

803
01:19:51,712 --> 01:19:56,115
I'll work in my farm, then
smoke with my friends and...

804
01:19:57,251 --> 01:19:58,809
...leave for a late night movie.
What else do I need?

805
01:20:00,253 --> 01:20:06,055
If we do not have your beloved ones
with you in your success or failure...

806
01:20:06,192 --> 01:20:11,129
there is no difference in money
earned or lost!

807
01:22:09,812 --> 01:22:13,873
"My eyes sought you,
I was lured by your youth"

808
01:22:14,483 --> 01:22:18,817
"Why is this happening to me?
My heart is trembling for you"

809
01:22:20,555 --> 01:22:22,750
"You are my dream man"

810
01:22:24,392 --> 01:22:27,384
"I want to tell you this"

811
01:23:09,133 --> 01:23:13,763
"The moment I met you,
my heart skipped a beat"

812
01:23:14,037 --> 01:23:18,497
"My little heart has
lost its control"

813
01:23:19,175 --> 01:23:23,635
"I'll give you a place in
my heart, if you come to me"

814
01:23:23,779 --> 01:23:29,877
"I'll fulfill your dreams if
you are there with me"

815
01:23:31,619 --> 01:23:34,747
"You are my dream girl"

816
01:23:36,457 --> 01:23:39,255
"I want to tell you the same"

817
01:24:33,843 --> 01:24:37,904
"I am speechless by
these words of yours"

818
01:24:38,847 --> 01:24:43,011
"I can't live without you"

819
01:24:43,685 --> 01:24:47,246
"I'll spend my whole life
looking into your eyes"

820
01:24:48,856 --> 01:24:54,590
"Days pass by in a minute
if you are there with me"

821
01:25:31,361 --> 01:25:32,328
Get ready soon, today is Friday and
we need to go to the temple

822
01:25:38,162 --> 01:25:41,131
Get ready soon, today is Friday and
we need to go to the temple

823
01:25:41,299 --> 01:25:44,928
To sleep you need to close
your eyes, not curtains.

824
01:26:05,388 --> 01:26:07,879
Please perform ritual "Archana"
- "Ashotothara" or "Sahasranaama"?

825
01:26:08,024 --> 01:26:09,582
Perform that which would
take lesser time

826
01:26:10,425 --> 01:26:12,120
Do the hundred time recital.

827
01:26:41,086 --> 01:26:47,082
What are you doing here?
- I am praying for you

828
01:26:48,427 --> 01:26:50,588
Don't lie to me. Are you always
so restless?

829
01:26:50,729 --> 01:26:53,425
What did I do now?
Don't try to innocent!

830
01:26:53,664 --> 01:26:54,153
Why are you staring at that girl?

831
01:26:56,567 --> 01:26:59,832
You came to know, but that lady
doesn't know till now

832
01:27:00,237 --> 01:27:02,068
Why don't you help me?
- God will not favour you.

833
01:27:02,539 --> 01:27:06,202
How'll he? You are settled in life
with your American guy

834
01:27:06,776 --> 01:27:12,612
But what about me? I am unable
to get a bride in Anakapalli

835
01:27:12,915 --> 01:27:17,614
Look I'm getting bald, so I've to
marry soon. I've my own tensions

836
01:27:19,488 --> 01:27:20,512
Why are you looking here?

837
01:27:23,691 --> 01:27:27,559
What's your problem if I am
looking out for girls?

838
01:27:35,135 --> 01:27:40,903
I like you
- It's joke.

839
01:27:42,509 --> 01:27:45,740
Don't you understand? I like you

840
01:27:45,878 --> 01:27:49,245
And if you look at any other girl,
I will kill you

841
01:28:15,906 --> 01:28:21,276
I lost my assets, I lost your mother.
I can't live without his friendship

842
01:28:21,544 --> 01:28:26,038
If you can't become anything at least
don't break our friendship.

843
01:29:24,159 --> 01:29:26,650
I didn't come here to ask
why did you leave the house?

844
01:29:27,396 --> 01:29:31,264
Nor am I here to see you off...
Even I am coming to Anakapalli.

845
01:29:31,399 --> 01:29:35,563
Not to speak about you, to ask
forgiveness from your father

846
01:29:36,170 --> 01:29:39,503
I will not embarrass you, I will
travel in another compartment

847
01:29:42,642 --> 01:29:45,668
Your father used to buy two pairs
of clothes every festival

848
01:29:46,146 --> 01:29:48,307
One for him, the other for me.

849
01:29:48,581 --> 01:29:51,311
He used to buy two sets
of text books every year

850
01:29:51,583 --> 01:29:53,073
One for him, the other for me

851
01:29:54,019 --> 01:30:00,549
He shared his happiness with me...
but hid his sorrows only from me

852
01:30:00,993 --> 01:30:05,487
When your mother died I was in US, he
didn't inform me until I was back...

853
01:30:05,630 --> 01:30:07,962
fearing that I would come back
half way through my job.

854
01:30:11,235 --> 01:30:13,601
People believe you, only after
you succeed in life...

855
01:30:13,737 --> 01:30:20,404
but only Shekar believed my
ambitions when I was nothing in life.

856
01:30:21,378 --> 01:30:26,042
In our long friendship, I asked him for
everything, he never asked for anything

857
01:30:27,450 --> 01:30:31,614
He asked me only one thing...
to get a job for his son

858
01:30:32,455 --> 01:30:36,152
Is it a big favour to get a job
for his son who gifted life to me?

859
01:30:38,660 --> 01:30:43,996
I couldn't do that also. You didn't
like the jobs I had shown...

860
01:30:44,099 --> 01:30:47,557
You couldn't like my family members,
I don't want to embarrass you

861
01:30:47,701 --> 01:30:50,636
It's not that uncle.
- Then why are you leaving?

862
01:30:50,771 --> 01:30:55,970
I wanted to see my father.
-If you go now can I face your father?

863
01:30:57,210 --> 01:30:58,507
I didn't give a thought to it uncle.

864
01:30:59,145 --> 01:31:02,706
If it's a serious problem, you can
leave. I'll apologise to your father

865
01:31:04,050 --> 01:31:07,713
In any case, you both shouldn't
ask forgiveness from each other

866
01:31:08,120 --> 01:31:13,649
And it should never ever happen
because of me... Come, let's go.

867
01:31:16,427 --> 01:31:25,665
Shekar's son is a family member to me
not a guest, remember that. Come.

868
01:31:31,775 --> 01:31:34,300
Go and have dinner.
- Okay

869
01:31:36,579 --> 01:31:41,107
Did you have anything on platform?
- No uncle.

870
01:31:52,360 --> 01:31:55,056
In just five minutes,
I will serve you dinner.

871
01:32:00,300 --> 01:32:03,167
For what?
- I didn't inform you while leaving.

872
01:32:03,537 --> 01:32:07,439
It's your house, you can come when you
like and go when you get bored.

873
01:32:07,741 --> 01:32:10,642
He is always like this, insists that
he should be informed about it.

874
01:32:10,776 --> 01:32:14,371
Don't take it seriously,
behave the way you like to.

875
01:32:21,219 --> 01:32:25,553
Venky, did my hubby trouble you?
- No, I felt like seeing my father.

876
01:32:25,690 --> 01:32:28,853
You could have informed us.
- I thought you wouldn't let me go.

877
01:32:29,194 --> 01:32:33,597
Felt your were in jail not in a house?
- Why should I feel so?

878
01:32:34,064 --> 01:32:35,429
You feel you are in a hostel?

879
01:32:36,733 --> 01:32:42,399
You spoke big words about marriage and
now are running away at the right time.

880
01:32:42,538 --> 01:32:45,701
Will you shut up? You should have
bothered him by your stupid question.

881
01:32:45,842 --> 01:32:48,367
He couldn't discuss this with
anybody, so he left.

882
01:32:48,544 --> 01:32:50,535
If you think like that,
then we don't have brains.

883
01:32:50,680 --> 01:32:54,207
Don't take him seriously. Go to your
room, I'll send the dinner there.

884
01:32:54,449 --> 01:32:57,111
With whom?
- Not with you. Bunty is there.

885
01:32:57,252 --> 01:33:00,483
It's better you confirm. Else, until
he has dinner I'll be worried.

886
01:33:06,527 --> 01:33:08,518
Nandu, please listen to me.

887
01:33:16,236 --> 01:33:20,297
"Enjoy your life...
you are born to enjoy"

888
01:33:33,352 --> 01:33:36,185
Do you know how much I am hurt?
- Because I'm back.

889
01:33:36,287 --> 01:33:37,845
Yes sir, .. No sir, because you left.

890
01:33:38,256 --> 01:33:40,554
Yes sir, do you need anything?
- Peace of mind.

891
01:33:40,691 --> 01:33:42,124
I'll leave

892
01:34:07,315 --> 01:34:08,475
Please take it.
- What is this?

893
01:34:08,616 --> 01:34:12,518
You've given a box, where's the tiffin?
- It's inside.

894
01:34:15,956 --> 01:34:17,184
If you have more in the afternoon,
you will get drowsy.

895
01:34:17,424 --> 01:34:19,324
If you have this less,
I'll be a patient soon.

896
01:34:19,459 --> 01:34:24,658
When jobless, you could eat more. Now
you can't have more because of tension.

897
01:35:00,797 --> 01:35:05,632
Look there... put it properly.
- I am putting it.

898
01:35:05,768 --> 01:35:09,363
Put it with both hands parallel.
- How is it?

899
01:35:09,471 --> 01:35:13,271
Parallel
- Then you can put it.

900
01:35:13,375 --> 01:35:14,364
How?
- Parallel

901
01:35:14,943 --> 01:35:16,808
I should call my wife now?

902
01:35:18,280 --> 01:35:19,804
What is it uncle?
- Come here for a moment.

903
01:35:22,550 --> 01:35:26,486
They are overconfident about their
height so we should put this...

904
01:35:26,687 --> 01:35:29,918
garland and prove we can manage
things without them.

905
01:35:30,590 --> 01:35:31,989
Uncle please...

906
01:35:32,459 --> 01:35:35,690
I'll ensure nobody comes in. You put
the garland with full concentration

907
01:35:36,930 --> 01:35:40,297
Okay.
- Climb... put it...

908
01:35:43,435 --> 01:35:52,241
If they think, they can stop the sun
from rising it's impossible.

909
01:36:02,419 --> 01:36:05,513
Which idiot asked you to come in?
- It was you who asked me to come in.

910
01:36:05,656 --> 01:36:07,783
If I say come in, you'll come in?
Where is mother?

911
01:36:07,924 --> 01:36:13,760
She is there
- Nothing has happened...

912
01:36:19,335 --> 01:36:24,068
Mother, what happened to your eyes?
- Master may be here any moment!

913
01:36:24,472 --> 01:36:27,600
If uncle see this?
- You'll not see your father tomorrow

914
01:36:28,076 --> 01:36:29,737
Are you here to work or
to take my life?

915
01:36:29,878 --> 01:36:33,279
Stand near the gate and as soon as
you see uncle's car, inform us.

916
01:36:33,381 --> 01:36:34,643
Look here
- What is it?

917
01:36:34,948 --> 01:36:36,313
My mother
- Why is she like this?

918
01:36:36,450 --> 01:36:39,010
Her eyes have gone.
- They have gone away 15 years ago.

919
01:36:39,320 --> 01:36:43,518
Will you shut up. You are an artist.
Please give her eyes and my life back

920
01:36:43,691 --> 01:36:45,454
Please speak in simple language.
- You don't understand.

921
01:36:45,591 --> 01:36:47,889
You need to paint her eyes or
else my brother will kill me.

922
01:36:48,594 --> 01:36:51,995
I can't remember her face.
How can I paint her eyes?

923
01:36:52,532 --> 01:36:55,524
Pack your luggage and run away.
- I beg you to shut your mouth.

924
01:36:56,101 --> 01:36:59,366
If you see her eyes, can you paint?
- No doubt about that

925
01:36:59,604 --> 01:37:03,005
Look at her eyes and paint, brother
says she has our mother's eyes.

926
01:37:03,475 --> 01:37:06,933
How can I do this?
- It's a matter of my life and death.

927
01:37:31,867 --> 01:37:35,735
Careful, nobody should get to know.
- Then tell him to stop it now.

928
01:38:00,025 --> 01:38:04,018
It's excellent, look how
meticulous is his work!

929
01:38:08,601 --> 01:38:13,368
What looks! She was staring at me
as though I'm a criminal.

930
01:38:13,705 --> 01:38:16,833
I'm decent that is why I was silent,
if anyone else was there...

931
01:38:17,108 --> 01:38:20,635
What can anybody do?
Her eyes are like that

932
01:38:20,911 --> 01:38:23,778
If you get tempted a little,
you will be ruined.

933
01:38:24,181 --> 01:38:29,380
But my heart is made of steel, it
won't melt. I have seen many eyes.

934
01:38:32,021 --> 01:38:38,483
But a word about those eyes...
It's better to talk less about them.

935
01:38:51,972 --> 01:38:55,135
Now she will think I have opened
the curtain for her.

936
01:38:55,476 --> 01:38:59,879
I opened the curtains not for you
but for fresh breeze.

937
01:39:08,421 --> 01:39:13,449
What is happening?
I didn't like your eyes...

938
01:39:34,240 --> 01:39:39,234
"I can't hide my feeling but
can't tell it to you also"

939
01:39:41,147 --> 01:39:46,449
"You want to go away but can't live
without me, what shall I do?

940
01:39:48,120 --> 01:39:50,486
"It's wrong on my part to
think to do so"

941
01:39:50,856 --> 01:39:58,422
"Listen to your heart, it's not
a sin to be in love"

942
01:39:58,596 --> 01:40:01,030
"Please spare me"

943
01:40:01,465 --> 01:40:03,933
"Why are you so scared"

944
01:40:45,172 --> 01:40:50,405
"In spite of my objection
you are after me"

945
01:40:50,509 --> 01:40:54,969
"Even in my dreams,
you trouble me"

946
01:40:56,248 --> 01:41:01,345
"You have stolen my heart away
and want to runaway from me"

947
01:41:01,453 --> 01:41:06,288
"I will be behind you
like your shadow"

948
01:41:06,357 --> 01:41:12,057
"My mind goes blank when
you come in front of me"

949
01:41:12,196 --> 01:41:17,259
"If I don't see you I am unable
to live for a second"

950
01:41:17,534 --> 01:41:22,335
"My thoughts are engulfed
by your smile"

951
01:41:58,938 --> 01:42:03,568
"Your eyes make me weak but I
can't stop looking into your eyes"

952
01:42:03,976 --> 01:42:08,913
"My heart skips a beat
if I don't see you"

953
01:42:09,281 --> 01:42:14,412
"I am lost in your world of love"

954
01:42:14,685 --> 01:42:19,054
"Your love has taught me
the meaning of life"

955
01:42:21,325 --> 01:42:25,318
"Your pleasant voice makes me sated"

956
01:42:25,495 --> 01:42:30,558
"Why cant' you control yourself?"

957
01:42:30,734 --> 01:42:35,262
"Your intoxicating beauty
made me lose it"

958
01:43:45,965 --> 01:43:51,369
It's time, aren't you going home?
- Getting scared to go home.

959
01:43:51,503 --> 01:43:56,497
Did you get married by chance?
- I'll take leave.

960
01:44:20,295 --> 01:44:22,422
Leaving from office?
- Yes.

961
01:44:22,831 --> 01:44:25,527
How are you colleagues?
- A lady is beautiful.

962
01:44:26,869 --> 01:44:29,463
Never can I control my tongue

963
01:44:35,743 --> 01:44:39,042
I've a board meeting, take her home.

964
01:44:40,747 --> 01:44:43,409
Do you have any meetings?
- No, I don't have any

965
01:44:48,555 --> 01:44:54,357
Let's have coffee, I'm tired of
office and you had been out shopping.

966
01:44:54,493 --> 01:44:56,757
Just to relax ourselves

967
01:45:14,344 --> 01:45:17,211
Forget coffee, let's have soup.
Get two soups.

968
01:45:17,447 --> 01:45:19,915
It should be served hot.
- It'll take time.

969
01:45:20,117 --> 01:45:24,884
We will wait.
- Not for serving but for having it.

970
01:45:25,388 --> 01:45:28,152
We'll blow and have it. Now leave.

971
01:45:30,326 --> 01:45:36,128
Isn't this restaurant good? Chairs
tables, spoons, and even forks.

972
01:45:38,833 --> 01:45:40,858
All restaurants have these things

973
01:45:41,203 --> 01:45:44,832
You had been shopping? Is it
jewellery shopping? Let me see

974
01:45:45,306 --> 01:45:47,433
Why are you snatching it away
as though I'm a thief?

975
01:45:47,808 --> 01:45:50,242
What is my mistake? Tell me.

976
01:45:50,377 --> 01:45:56,247
From the time I returned, I've watched
you banging on doors, pouring water.

977
01:45:56,382 --> 01:45:58,077
I am making a note of
all this in my diary

978
01:45:58,218 --> 01:46:03,622
Every dog has its day...
Even I'll have my day.

979
01:46:04,157 --> 01:46:09,117
Then I'll show what I am.
Why is this quarrel between us?

980
01:46:09,294 --> 01:46:11,819
In few days you'll leave for
the States after marriage.

981
01:46:12,197 --> 01:46:14,427
My boss can't tolerate me and will
throw me out. I'll be back home.

982
01:46:14,600 --> 01:46:17,160
Then we will not see each other.
Isn't it?

983
01:46:17,368 --> 01:46:21,327
So let's be friends and have fun
in this short time.

984
01:46:23,140 --> 01:46:27,076
If you don't want to see my face,
get up after I leave for the office.

985
01:46:27,344 --> 01:46:29,312
You agree for all this, right?
Let's shake hands and be friends

986
01:46:31,948 --> 01:46:33,074
It should be done with hands
and not with the fork.

987
01:46:55,203 --> 01:46:56,966
Was the soup so tasty
you ate the plate also?

988
01:46:58,872 --> 01:47:02,137
Was the soup hot?
- Very hot

989
01:47:02,376 --> 01:47:05,368
Is it for the bill?
- No, it's for my clothes

990
01:47:05,545 --> 01:47:06,375
For me?
- It's for me.

991
01:47:06,880 --> 01:47:07,938
What's the size?
- Get any size

992
01:47:32,403 --> 01:47:35,236
Why are you looking there.
The meter is there. So look there

993
01:48:16,710 --> 01:48:19,372
Who's it?
- I'm your boyfriend speaking.

994
01:48:19,612 --> 01:48:22,137
It's you? I was seeing
your wedding card

995
01:48:22,315 --> 01:48:24,579
How is it?
- How is the bridegroom?

996
01:48:24,683 --> 01:48:28,483
He is not as good as card,
but ...it's okay

997
01:48:30,022 --> 01:48:32,957
Don't miss my marriage. Pinky also
must be here without fail

998
01:48:33,124 --> 01:48:36,719
If you miss my wedding...
I'll murder you

999
01:48:48,138 --> 01:48:49,605
Asha's marriage.
- When?

1000
01:48:49,706 --> 01:48:51,606
The day after.
- Good. Have fun.

1001
01:48:52,376 --> 01:48:54,640
Will daddy agree to it?
- Why not, tell him I have told you

1002
01:48:55,077 --> 01:48:57,102
It means that you won't talk to him?
- I am busy.

1003
01:48:57,313 --> 01:48:58,712
You could have told directly
that you don't have guts

1004
01:49:05,653 --> 01:49:08,178
I need to talk something important
- Tell me

1005
01:49:09,090 --> 01:49:10,489
Sister's friend, Asha's marriage.

1006
01:49:12,327 --> 01:49:17,162
We both are thinking of going.
- You needn't go. Send a greeting card.

1007
01:49:18,465 --> 01:49:22,128
If we miss marriages now, you'll see
only me and my husband in my marriage

1008
01:49:23,203 --> 01:49:26,798
My wife don't talk against me...
how can you?

1009
01:49:27,774 --> 01:49:31,107
You always favored her right?
Now see how she talks to me

1010
01:49:31,344 --> 01:49:32,504
Don't scold my aunty in front of me

1011
01:49:33,513 --> 01:49:36,175
You are telling me how
I've to be with my wife?

1012
01:49:37,015 --> 01:49:38,539
Please send us.

1013
01:49:39,084 --> 01:49:40,210
So if you don't go to the marriage...
will it be stopped half way?

1014
01:49:40,519 --> 01:49:42,487
It won't stop, Asha will feel bad.

1015
01:49:44,122 --> 01:49:46,352
Okay. I'll book the train tickets.

1016
01:49:46,525 --> 01:49:48,720
Don't want train...
We'll go in your car.

1017
01:49:50,060 --> 01:49:52,551
I'm busy, I'll not come.
- It's enough if you give us your car

1018
01:49:54,198 --> 01:49:58,294
Nandu's will be the last marriage...
she'll definitely elope with someone.

1019
01:49:59,636 --> 01:50:03,037
Let them go.
- How'll I send these girls all alone?

1020
01:50:03,239 --> 01:50:05,639
Send them with your brother.
- Daddy? I don't want to go with him

1021
01:50:08,178 --> 01:50:10,237
Okay, take Venky along with you.
He'll protect you

1022
01:50:10,446 --> 01:50:11,208
Thank you Uncle.

1023
01:50:22,056 --> 01:50:23,489
Why is your face so dull?

1024
01:50:25,660 --> 01:50:28,094
I can't see you like that.
So now what should I do?

1025
01:50:28,329 --> 01:50:31,594
Why do you talk to him?
It's stupidity to throw stones on mud.

1026
01:50:32,399 --> 01:50:37,393
To be smart you need to undress
before throwing stones on the mud

1027
01:50:38,572 --> 01:50:39,402
Look in the front.

1028
01:51:01,291 --> 01:51:05,557
Be careful Venky, I am getting scared.
- In that case, close your eyes

1029
01:51:28,116 --> 01:51:30,744
Who are you?
- Do you have any urgent work?

1030
01:51:30,919 --> 01:51:34,446
No
- Come here and please be seated.

1031
01:51:37,191 --> 01:51:38,886
I don't smoke
- I am from Anakapalli.

1032
01:51:39,293 --> 01:51:41,523
Since I was unlucky, my father
sent me to a house in Hyderabad

1033
01:51:41,695 --> 01:51:43,219
He told my father he'll
get a job for me.

1034
01:51:44,864 --> 01:51:46,388
Why are you sitting there?
Get the luggage.

1035
01:51:46,499 --> 01:51:48,467
I'll get it
- Is she your sister?

1036
01:51:48,801 --> 01:51:52,328
If I would've had such a sister,
then I would've killed her

1037
01:51:53,473 --> 01:51:55,168
I'll keep the luggage and join you
- Okay

1038
01:52:03,482 --> 01:52:06,349
It's good
- Why are you still here?

1039
01:52:06,551 --> 01:52:09,679
This is only a ladies room
- Is it so? Then we both should leave

1040
01:52:09,854 --> 01:52:11,583
Is it a joke?
- You didn't like it?

1041
01:52:14,158 --> 01:52:17,286
If you don't like it, then say so.
Why do you want throw me out?

1042
01:52:18,929 --> 01:52:21,659
What happened? You fell off?
- No, they threw me out.

1043
01:52:21,865 --> 01:52:22,331
I thought you fell off.

1044
01:52:25,168 --> 01:52:27,636
Are you from a list of bride's
or the bridegroom's?

1045
01:52:27,836 --> 01:52:29,326
I am from the city
of Hyderabad's list.

1046
01:52:30,339 --> 01:52:31,829
I liked you very much

1047
01:52:33,342 --> 01:52:37,278
There is a special room for people
like us, let's go there and talk

1048
01:52:37,445 --> 01:52:40,573
I wanted to have a bath first...
- You can do it there itself.

1049
01:52:40,815 --> 01:52:42,840
Then let's move.
That's it

1050
01:52:49,790 --> 01:52:52,657
Who is he?
- Well, who are you?

1051
01:52:52,859 --> 01:52:57,853
I told you that I'm the bride's guest?
- He is the bride's guest...

1052
01:52:59,198 --> 01:53:00,256
Have a smoke...

1053
01:53:07,206 --> 01:53:11,540
Is the bride your friend?
- Not very close, I just know her.

1054
01:53:12,444 --> 01:53:14,742
What do you know?
- She is beautiful

1055
01:53:15,213 --> 01:53:17,681
If we see, we'll know that.
- She speaks well.

1056
01:53:18,383 --> 01:53:22,217
We'll know if we speak to her.
Say something special about her

1057
01:53:22,686 --> 01:53:27,316
I don't know her in depth.
- He'll tell after he has a cold drink.

1058
01:53:33,229 --> 01:53:34,423
I don't have such habits.

1059
01:53:35,832 --> 01:53:41,236
You'll learn everything step
by step. Pour the whisky

1060
01:53:45,974 --> 01:53:47,839
You are not born with habits,
you need to cultivate them

1061
01:53:53,981 --> 01:53:56,006
How's it?
- Was it smooth?

1062
01:53:56,250 --> 01:53:58,411
Was it bad?
- Feeling drowsy?

1063
01:53:59,587 --> 01:54:00,986
Feel like having another drink.

1064
01:54:08,762 --> 01:54:09,751
Now tell me
- About what?

1065
01:54:16,435 --> 01:54:18,460
I had an affair with Asha.
- Really?

1066
01:54:19,438 --> 01:54:21,429
After having this, will I say a lie?

1067
01:54:22,041 --> 01:54:26,273
With help of piano! But don't tell
this to bridegroom, he'll feel bad

1068
01:54:28,279 --> 01:54:31,874
I am speaking about her and
why is he getting tensed?

1069
01:54:33,450 --> 01:54:34,940
He is the bridegroom.

1070
01:54:39,623 --> 01:54:44,560
It's due to cold drinks. She's like
my sister, I swear, I don't love her

1071
01:54:44,827 --> 01:54:45,953
Why didn't you love her?

1072
01:54:48,798 --> 01:54:52,632
So you mean that she is so ugly
that you can't love her?

1073
01:54:55,303 --> 01:54:57,863
Why you didn't love her? What is
the drawback in her?

1074
01:54:59,507 --> 01:55:02,772
There is a strong reason why
I didn't love her

1075
01:55:02,977 --> 01:55:05,104
What's it?
- I have an affair with another lady

1076
01:55:05,479 --> 01:55:09,108
What's this? It's hard to get a girl
and he has dozens of affairs?

1077
01:55:09,483 --> 01:55:12,384
I'll kill him and go to jail.

1078
01:55:15,321 --> 01:55:16,913
He is feeling the kick.
Allow him to sleep.

1079
01:55:19,826 --> 01:55:22,989
Actually... I...
- Let it be simple and not in detail

1080
01:55:27,666 --> 01:55:29,827
This is... she, this is... me

1081
01:55:30,836 --> 01:55:35,500
Initially, we both used
to hate each other

1082
01:55:35,674 --> 01:55:38,006
Both of us used to fight like hell

1083
01:55:39,643 --> 01:55:42,669
Don't know what happened...
She started smiling when she saw me

1084
01:55:42,913 --> 01:55:46,644
I smiled... she started to talk.
She was saying "good night" too.

1085
01:55:47,684 --> 01:55:51,745
Suddenly, one day she said I like you
...her character turned upside down!

1086
01:55:52,689 --> 01:55:56,523
What happened to your glass?...
Why did you place it like that?

1087
01:55:56,760 --> 01:55:59,388
This is my situation, I can
neither say yes nor no.

1088
01:55:59,595 --> 01:56:01,688
There's a small disturbance

1089
01:56:02,364 --> 01:56:06,460
Her eyes... oops. Is it her?
- We know its glass.

1090
01:56:06,702 --> 01:56:10,934
I can't control myself.
- Then commit yourself to her

1091
01:56:12,373 --> 01:56:14,807
It's wrong, I can't.
- Why?

1092
01:56:17,478 --> 01:56:19,639
She is already engaged.

1093
01:56:20,547 --> 01:56:23,641
That's all? I am in love
with a married woman.

1094
01:56:24,384 --> 01:56:25,715
Then what happened?
- Again the war started.

1095
01:56:25,886 --> 01:56:27,717
When I was leaving for office,
she poured water on me.

1096
01:56:27,921 --> 01:56:29,684
Then what did you do?
- Will I remain silent?

1097
01:56:29,855 --> 01:56:32,881
Then I took her to a hotel, ordered
for soup and yelled at her

1098
01:56:33,058 --> 01:56:34,992
Then what happened?
- She poured soup on me!

1099
01:56:35,161 --> 01:56:36,958
Then what did you do?
- Washed my trousers.

1100
01:56:39,398 --> 01:56:42,060
That wasn't right.
- Once it was water and then soup

1101
01:56:42,200 --> 01:56:48,070
If I continue, then one day she may
pour acid... That's why I am silent

1102
01:56:48,807 --> 01:56:52,106
If she is not falling
behind you, is she ugly

1103
01:56:53,410 --> 01:56:55,401
Two eyes aren't adequate
to look at her

1104
01:56:55,612 --> 01:56:56,601
Is she so fat...?

1105
01:56:58,045 --> 01:57:05,076
"My lover's steps is a lesson
for the ostrich"

1106
01:57:06,553 --> 01:57:14,927
"Is she walks it's a lesson
for the dancing streams"

1107
01:57:34,244 --> 01:57:38,271
"Her smiles can create
waves in my heart"

1108
01:57:38,648 --> 01:57:43,085
"It's like a smooth
thorn prick in my heart"

1109
01:57:43,252 --> 01:57:47,245
"Her looks is enough to light
a passion of fire in me"

1110
01:57:47,590 --> 01:57:51,754
"It's like a new world to me"

1111
01:57:52,595 --> 01:57:56,725
"Can we dream in the daylight?"

1112
01:57:56,931 --> 01:58:00,867
"She has made me a daydreamer"

1113
01:58:46,310 --> 01:58:48,278
I am feeling light

1114
01:58:48,444 --> 01:58:50,435
I want to fly high

1115
01:58:50,780 --> 01:58:54,841
"She is like the blossom
flower in Spring"

1116
01:58:57,320 --> 01:58:59,652
"Her walk is so elegant and soft"

1117
01:58:59,821 --> 01:59:01,812
"Her fragrance is spread
all over the air"

1118
01:59:01,957 --> 01:59:05,893
"I can't stop running back to her"

1119
01:59:08,396 --> 01:59:12,162
"Her walk can bloom the flowers"

1120
01:59:12,800 --> 01:59:16,292
"...it can bring life into
inanimate objects"

1121
02:00:04,046 --> 02:00:06,037
"I am lured by her fragrance"

1122
02:00:06,182 --> 02:00:08,207
"How can I forget those memories?"

1123
02:00:08,718 --> 02:00:12,381
"It's very difficult to
stay away from her"

1124
02:00:14,723 --> 02:00:17,055
"When I visualise her"

1125
02:00:17,192 --> 02:00:19,217
"I can't think about other things"

1126
02:00:21,429 --> 02:00:23,727
"How can I stop thinking of
her even for a second?"

1127
02:00:25,866 --> 02:00:29,324
"I hope my dream will
come true one day"

1128
02:00:30,404 --> 02:00:34,238
How can I explain these things
and how much she means to me?

1129
02:00:34,474 --> 02:00:37,875
"Don't worry my dear friend,
She is born for you"

1130
02:00:38,077 --> 02:00:42,241
"and she'll come back to you only"

1131
02:01:31,983 --> 02:01:34,508
I thought this was my room.
- It's your room.

1132
02:01:34,686 --> 02:01:37,018
Why are you both here?
- We were waiting for you.

1133
02:01:37,187 --> 02:01:39,052
Did you lose your luggage?
- We lost our image.

1134
02:01:39,790 --> 02:01:41,917
We didn't believe when they
said you are a drunkard.

1135
02:01:42,092 --> 02:01:44,151
Now there's no choice, except to
believe what we see

1136
02:01:44,328 --> 02:01:46,853
I told everybody that Venky
wasn't like this.

1137
02:01:47,163 --> 02:01:49,188
I am like what you had thought

1138
02:01:50,700 --> 02:01:55,194
They told it was only whisky but
they mixed cold drinks with it.

1139
02:01:56,673 --> 02:01:58,868
Let's leave. Why do we need
to talk to drunkards.

1140
02:01:59,541 --> 02:02:02,772
Don't speak anything. Tomorrow ring
up my uncle and speak to them

1141
02:02:03,211 --> 02:02:09,878
Why such a big punishment? I accept
my mistake. Please give another chance

1142
02:02:10,051 --> 02:02:11,746
So that you can have more
cold drinks?

1143
02:02:11,886 --> 02:02:14,047
Not to have, but to quit drinking

1144
02:02:14,221 --> 02:02:17,588
But please don't tell your uncle.
I'll do anything that you say.

1145
02:02:18,059 --> 02:02:20,960
What are you doing?
- Asking for forgiveness at your feet

1146
02:02:21,094 --> 02:02:23,028
You are holding the cot's leg
and not mine.

1147
02:02:24,097 --> 02:02:27,624
Let's go.
- Am I so drunk?

1148
02:02:36,008 --> 02:02:37,908
Sorry I didn't see.
It's okay.

1149
02:02:38,077 --> 02:02:40,068
It is never a pain to be touched
by handsome guys like you

1150
02:02:45,917 --> 02:02:48,249
How are you?
- That guy banged into my wife

1151
02:02:49,821 --> 02:02:54,281
It's better we follow him
- He looks innocent.

1152
02:02:54,625 --> 02:02:57,753
The guy may be innocent, but
my wife is not. That's my fear.

1153
02:03:19,614 --> 02:03:20,945
Asha knows you are here?
- No.

1154
02:03:21,616 --> 02:03:24,346
In a few minutes she'll be here.
- Yes, I know

1155
02:03:25,285 --> 02:03:29,119
If you don't mind, till I marry her,
can you please hide yourself?

1156
02:03:31,191 --> 02:03:36,060
Actually I want to see how bad
she feels to get married to you.

1157
02:03:37,630 --> 02:03:39,120
You really want to speak
about this, now?

1158
02:03:40,299 --> 02:03:41,129
Now leave.

1159
02:03:49,808 --> 02:03:55,041
Hello. The bridegroom is good looking.
- I know. That's why I'm marrying him

1160
02:03:55,312 --> 02:03:57,109
How are you?
- I am average.

1161
02:03:58,783 --> 02:03:59,272
Where's your wife?

1162
02:04:02,019 --> 02:04:05,955
Shall we tell him she knows the truth?
- Why should we bother? Now shut up.

1163
02:04:08,725 --> 02:04:10,886
She may be here somewhere.
- Where?

1164
02:04:20,903 --> 02:04:21,733
Aunty...

1165
02:04:25,673 --> 02:04:27,004
You are?
- Uncle.

1166
02:04:27,208 --> 02:04:28,869
What's it?
You have married him?

1167
02:04:29,077 --> 02:04:31,477
Me?
- From far I thought you are my wife

1168
02:04:34,248 --> 02:04:38,776
Why are you blushing?
- Young man! Leave him.

1169
02:04:39,019 --> 02:04:42,011
If I leave him today,
tomorrow you will leave me.

1170
02:04:42,222 --> 02:04:46,056
Have I ever cheated? I have only one
wife, why are you taking her away?

1171
02:04:46,159 --> 02:04:48,957
Just listen to me.
- So that you can convince me?

1172
02:04:49,195 --> 02:04:52,426
Why are you yelling at her here?
She'll feel bad.

1173
02:04:52,698 --> 02:04:54,359
Why are you feeling so much for her?

1174
02:04:54,700 --> 02:04:56,930
To understand feelings,
he needn't be a husband.

1175
02:04:57,103 --> 02:04:58,365
A person with a heart is enough!

1176
02:05:05,210 --> 02:05:06,040
Just look there...

1177
02:05:17,221 --> 02:05:20,054
What is this? You are leaving?
You are not staying for first night?

1178
02:05:20,256 --> 02:05:22,451
For your first night, only your
husband is enough, why all of us?

1179
02:05:24,360 --> 02:05:28,228
Tomorrow is my reception. Please
stay for it and then leave.

1180
02:05:29,431 --> 02:05:31,729
I can't wait. I have an important
work in the office.

1181
02:05:35,737 --> 02:05:38,934
It's not that... important
- That means you are staying.

1182
02:05:39,874 --> 02:05:41,739
I should speak to my daddy.
- I'll take care of it.

1183
02:05:43,077 --> 02:05:45,204
What to do till tomorrow evening?
- Let's recite prayers.

1184
02:05:49,150 --> 02:05:52,415
There's a Water Park nearby, it's
very good to spend some time there

1185
02:06:13,271 --> 02:06:17,264
Where are you going?
Even I am going there...

1186
02:06:17,441 --> 02:06:22,344
But my car tyre got punctured.
- Get in... Pinky you go behind

1187
02:06:57,144 --> 02:06:58,975
I am coming
- Come in.

1188
02:07:06,152 --> 02:07:07,346
Now where to?

1189
02:07:09,856 --> 02:07:11,346
Why should we wait to give
a lift to someone?

1190
02:07:12,525 --> 02:07:14,823
Why? Am I not driving this car
for people like you?

1191
02:07:25,336 --> 02:07:29,033
I am diabetic, often I'll have to go.
- Where?

1192
02:07:31,008 --> 02:07:32,999
He is diabetic, he is comic.

1193
02:07:34,845 --> 02:07:39,009
Why is that umbrella?
- A precaution if it rains

1194
02:07:40,850 --> 02:07:43,375
Is there cash in the bag?
- Raincoat and hat.

1195
02:07:44,854 --> 02:07:47,584
It's a precaution if the
wind blows off the umbrella.

1196
02:07:50,959 --> 02:07:55,362
Why did you put so many locks?
- Someone may steal it. So...

1197
02:07:55,564 --> 02:07:57,191
Precautionary measure.
- Correct.

1198
02:07:59,467 --> 02:08:03,198
Don't you've spare tyre in the car?
- I have a new one

1199
02:08:03,537 --> 02:08:05,869
Then?
- Have one, but two are flat.

1200
02:08:07,441 --> 02:08:10,274
He must have met with an accident
and gone forever

1201
02:08:10,443 --> 02:08:14,539
What was the banging noise?
- I banged the engine with a stone.

1202
02:08:14,681 --> 02:08:18,481
Even if a thief unlocks all the locks
the car shouldn't start.

1203
02:08:18,651 --> 02:08:19,879
And if you need to start the car?

1204
02:08:35,233 --> 02:08:40,102
As gratitude for your help,
I want to gift a snap of you.

1205
02:08:40,237 --> 02:08:41,135
Okay, sure why not
- Even you both.

1206
02:09:06,594 --> 02:09:10,257
How is it?
- I can see stars!

1207
02:09:12,433 --> 02:09:14,993
I am fine, just check
out my umbrella?

1208
02:09:19,173 --> 02:09:20,663
It looks okay
- My umbrella is okay.

1209
02:09:27,246 --> 02:09:31,273
Slowly, carefully.
- Look how is he walking?

1210
02:09:31,451 --> 02:09:34,943
How are you now?
- Why are you asking me repeatedly?

1211
02:09:35,454 --> 02:09:38,287
What do I know? I need to check it
out after going home. Let's move.

1212
02:09:41,960 --> 02:09:44,952
Shall we go for a ride?
- Even you join us uncle?

1213
02:09:46,564 --> 02:09:50,227
This is small, I'll come for that.
- Which one?

1214
02:09:51,369 --> 02:09:55,362
In this state, do you need to go?
- I am unable to stand due to pain

1215
02:09:55,538 --> 02:09:59,167
At least I can sit and relax there...
...let's go.

1216
02:10:01,478 --> 02:10:04,174
You are leaving her alone and
going, she'll cry.

1217
02:10:09,251 --> 02:10:11,742
This is your first time
- Yes, do we feel dizzy on top?

1218
02:10:12,121 --> 02:10:13,213
I don't feel anything you may feel

1219
02:10:15,189 --> 02:10:16,156
Get me one ticket.

1220
02:10:20,428 --> 02:10:22,089
What are you waiting for?
Let people come.

1221
02:10:22,497 --> 02:10:24,055
To turn the wheel
- No sir.

1222
02:10:24,332 --> 02:10:28,462
Should she wait till it fills up.
- It's not a cycle, it's a gaint wheel

1223
02:10:28,635 --> 02:10:30,500
Should have informed before, start it.
- It can't be done

1224
02:10:30,670 --> 02:10:34,128
Switch it on now
- Stupid customer.

1225
02:10:45,217 --> 02:10:47,014
Stop it,
- What happened?

1226
02:10:48,253 --> 02:10:52,519
When I gave a thought, you were right,
we shall have coffee till people come.

1227
02:10:57,361 --> 02:11:01,263
What is your name?
Please get me down.

1228
02:11:15,044 --> 02:11:20,038
Do you have any brains?
Are you deaf, can't you listen?

1229
02:11:28,722 --> 02:11:29,188
You spoke to me

1230
02:11:36,163 --> 02:11:38,791
No, I didn't speak to you.
- Hey, Nandu spoke to me.

1231
02:12:02,587 --> 02:12:07,752
Why did you sit here? Got angry?
Feeling like crying? Tired?

1232
02:12:09,360 --> 02:12:11,726
Unnecessarily, why are you
trying to catch me?

1233
02:12:13,296 --> 02:12:14,854
You'll not be able to catch me

1234
02:12:18,768 --> 02:12:20,861
What happened? You took me seriously.

1235
02:12:23,472 --> 02:12:29,035
Please now don't start all this
again, I can't bear it.

1236
02:12:29,111 --> 02:12:31,306
What do you want now?
Should I say sorry?

1237
02:12:33,781 --> 02:12:37,114
Isn't it okay? Want to scold me?
Scold me as you wish to

1238
02:12:38,119 --> 02:12:42,180
Isn't this also okay? Want to hit me?
Here take this and beat me.

1239
02:12:43,690 --> 02:12:46,784
Stop it, It's better if you
don't speak to me

1240
02:12:49,129 --> 02:12:50,460
Come...

1241
02:12:55,301 --> 02:13:00,637
Sit down. Why are you so scared?
Don't feel frightened.

1242
02:13:00,806 --> 02:13:05,641
Even for me this is the first time.
It will just go like this and then...

1243
02:13:05,810 --> 02:13:10,611
like this... and then the end...!
Feel scared then have my hand.

1244
02:13:11,249 --> 02:13:13,649
Now close it. No need to fear.

1245
02:13:16,720 --> 02:13:18,745
Look at him, he is dead
before the ride

1246
02:13:18,889 --> 02:13:21,687
All aren't as courageous as you are
- Then they shouldn't come for rides.

1247
02:13:21,892 --> 02:13:25,692
I am allergic to cowardly people.
Now sit properly

1248
02:14:09,201 --> 02:14:10,532
I am dying

1249
02:14:42,565 --> 02:14:45,966
Why are you in urgency?
- I need to go to the loo.

1250
02:15:05,052 --> 02:15:07,247
What is he doing so long
inside the loo?

1251
02:15:07,421 --> 02:15:10,686
Please don't talk to me. I'm
controlling since very long time

1252
02:15:10,890 --> 02:15:12,414
Even your state is like mine?

1253
02:15:17,430 --> 02:15:18,692
I'll do it somewhere else.

1254
02:15:19,432 --> 02:15:22,265
I never knew this country
is so over populated

1255
02:15:24,770 --> 02:15:26,260
It is so peaceful here

1256
02:15:59,335 --> 02:16:01,428
If the same continues, I'll die

1257
02:16:11,612 --> 02:16:12,806
God...! What shall I do

1258
02:16:28,661 --> 02:16:29,491
The line might have been shortened.
I'll check it out.

1259
02:16:33,866 --> 02:16:35,128
Go back.

1260
02:16:46,343 --> 02:16:47,139
Is she blind?

1261
02:16:59,655 --> 02:17:01,088
All of you should die.

1262
02:17:02,158 --> 02:17:06,094
That flower is so beautiful, right?
- Yes, it's very beautiful.

1263
02:17:06,362 --> 02:17:09,661
You are talking about me?
- Don't we have any other topic?

1264
02:17:10,465 --> 02:17:14,060
Usually young girls speak about
clothes, jewellery and Venky.

1265
02:17:14,403 --> 02:17:16,166
Really
- What else?

1266
02:17:18,939 --> 02:17:20,099
Did you see that flower?
- Yes I saw it. It's beautiful.

1267
02:17:20,441 --> 02:17:23,035
Then why are you still sitting here?
- What should I do?

1268
02:17:23,377 --> 02:17:25,436
You should go and get it.
- Is it for you?

1269
02:17:25,646 --> 02:17:29,548
No, it's for my sister.
- You can see flower, I can see tree.

1270
02:17:31,184 --> 02:17:34,051
A girl is asking for a flower and
you can't get it. Are you a man?

1271
02:17:35,488 --> 02:17:37,581
Already I have many doubts,
please don't raise new ones

1272
02:17:41,093 --> 02:17:42,117
I'm feeling hungry.
Shall we have some snacks?

1273
02:17:42,828 --> 02:17:43,920
You had it just now.
- So what?

1274
02:17:46,031 --> 02:17:48,056
How much is that?
- Which one? It's 15 rupees

1275
02:17:48,200 --> 02:17:50,760
The one below that.
- The one below is 23 rupees

1276
02:17:50,935 --> 02:17:53,927
The above one.
- Which one do you want?

1277
02:17:55,907 --> 02:17:58,740
Yours is a peculiar family.
- You are very talkative

1278
02:17:58,910 --> 02:17:59,672
What about you?

1279
02:18:01,812 --> 02:18:04,042
What to play again?
Do you know the game?

1280
02:18:04,414 --> 02:18:06,075
Yes, I know.
I'll do like this and you to hit me.

1281
02:18:15,758 --> 02:18:17,419
I hit you.
- When did you hit me?

1282
02:18:17,626 --> 02:18:19,992
I touched your last finger.
- If you lie, you'll have a girl baby

1283
02:18:20,196 --> 02:18:22,926
I don't want to say truth and
give birth to boys like you.

1284
02:18:24,666 --> 02:18:25,860
What do you say now?
- I hit you.

1285
02:18:26,434 --> 02:18:28,061
Arrogant girl!
Now it's your turn

1286
02:19:08,506 --> 02:19:11,202
Did I disturb you?
- You are born for that.

1287
02:19:20,717 --> 02:19:21,547
Where is the card?

1288
02:19:28,557 --> 02:19:34,655
He told he'll be back soon. It's half
an hour already, he hasn't arrived yet

1289
02:19:57,683 --> 02:20:00,846
What is this new technique?
- Shall we look out for Venky?

1290
02:20:01,020 --> 02:20:04,683
It's better to look out for him rather
than seeing these new techniques.

1291
02:20:19,903 --> 02:20:20,699
How much is it?
- One rupee

1292
02:20:22,873 --> 02:20:23,669
I asked your weight, not rate

1293
02:20:24,207 --> 02:20:26,072
You shouldn't ask a man's height
and a woman's weight.

1294
02:20:30,046 --> 02:20:31,035
Why are you laughing?

1295
02:20:37,353 --> 02:20:40,550
"You'll get your dream man"
- Look how true it is

1296
02:20:41,356 --> 02:20:43,984
Do you believe in this?...
Take it. I'll tell you.

1297
02:20:49,030 --> 02:20:50,224
What's this?

1298
02:20:58,572 --> 02:21:00,233
What's it?
- Read it.

1299
02:21:00,907 --> 02:21:04,035
"You'll reach great heights
in your life"

1300
02:21:05,345 --> 02:21:07,142
This will reach... great...
heights...?

1301
02:21:10,149 --> 02:21:12,777
This 15th is my sister's marriage.
Please be there without fail.

1302
02:21:12,951 --> 02:21:14,680
Definitely, I'll be there.
What's this?

1303
02:21:14,820 --> 02:21:16,310
Take this visiting card
to be an invitation card.

1304
02:21:18,657 --> 02:21:21,592
Careful! You've to be careful
when you are crossing roads

1305
02:21:22,093 --> 02:21:24,823
You have to look on all sides as
there will be heavy traffic.

1306
02:21:25,096 --> 02:21:30,796
Look how I walk. I always think
before I place every step.

1307
02:21:33,169 --> 02:21:35,729
Where's uncle?
- Who knows where he went?

1308
02:22:16,108 --> 02:22:21,842
Everywhere I'm seeing only old
buddies. Life looks so colourless

1309
02:22:22,148 --> 02:22:24,878
That's why have we
arranged a reception

1310
02:22:26,017 --> 02:22:30,010
We have made strict rules, that old
buddies shouldn't enter the hall

1311
02:22:34,459 --> 02:22:41,023
Look how beautiful she is!
- You've just been married and you...

1312
02:22:41,198 --> 02:22:45,828
But both are different.
...had your lunch?

1313
02:23:12,126 --> 02:23:17,029
I have brought cold drinks...
- I don't want that.

1314
02:23:17,364 --> 02:23:20,697
Come to our room and
at least, play cards.

1315
02:23:23,770 --> 02:23:27,035
Why did you give me the flower?
Shall I serve more?

1316
02:23:27,207 --> 02:23:28,037
It's alright.

1317
02:23:31,810 --> 02:23:34,711
It's my glass.
- That's why water was so sweet...

1318
02:23:42,487 --> 02:23:43,317
This time it'll not be replaced

1319
02:23:49,359 --> 02:23:51,224
Don't stare at me like this.
I'll not be able to face you

1320
02:23:51,361 --> 02:23:53,329
Men do stare at women
like this, right?

1321
02:23:54,331 --> 02:23:55,889
I never thought it
would be so troublesome.

1322
02:23:56,867 --> 02:23:58,300
Please leave.
- I'll give napkin and then leave

1323
02:23:58,502 --> 02:24:00,129
You keep it there, I'll take it.
- It's okay.

1324
02:24:02,171 --> 02:24:03,069
I'm finished. Now leave.

1325
02:24:04,840 --> 02:24:07,809
Why did you give me the flower?
Tell me. Why did you give it?

1326
02:24:08,477 --> 02:24:13,244
I'm a fool! You had liked it. Thought
you would feel happy seeing that...

1327
02:24:19,888 --> 02:24:21,378
Leave my hand
- I won't. What will you do?

1328
02:24:21,922 --> 02:24:26,256
I'll beg at your feet to leave me
- You want leg, when I've given hands?

1329
02:24:29,263 --> 02:24:31,458
You know what do they say for this?
- Holding hands.

1330
02:24:32,265 --> 02:24:36,531
As per the tradition, if we hold
hands like this then we are married.

1331
02:24:37,436 --> 02:24:40,428
Don't bring new rules. Only marriage
chain brings the bondage

1332
02:24:42,774 --> 02:24:44,105
What do you eat?

1333
02:24:47,946 --> 02:24:50,972
Don't be happy since I left your hand.
No matter what, I'll not leave you

1334
02:25:11,034 --> 02:25:14,800
When you quit smoking you should
tell your friends because...

1335
02:25:14,970 --> 02:25:22,069
though you'll be tempted to smoke,
for the fear...

1336
02:25:22,311 --> 02:25:24,802
...that your friends may tease you,
you will not smoke.

1337
02:25:27,048 --> 02:25:34,284
When you get married, you invite
people, take photos... because...

1338
02:25:34,822 --> 02:25:41,284
in future, if tempted to break the
marriage, for the fear of people...

1339
02:25:41,428 --> 02:25:44,363
...you may have to compromise
and remain with your wife.

1340
02:25:49,635 --> 02:25:54,629
I can't bear being hit by apples...
hence I'm presenting my friend...

1341
02:26:01,479 --> 02:26:05,006
I'll speak a little about Mohan.
I said little because

1342
02:26:05,183 --> 02:26:07,515
I can't speak good about him.

1343
02:26:09,486 --> 02:26:13,183
I used to feel, there is absence
of love in arranged marriages.

1344
02:26:17,194 --> 02:26:19,662
She is as innocent as a lamb

1345
02:26:23,099 --> 02:26:25,192
Where as he is as cunning as a fox

1346
02:26:26,202 --> 02:26:28,363
I was wondering how this
couple would lead a life?

1347
02:26:29,204 --> 02:26:36,201
I was wrong, they've been married for
hardly 24 hours, they are in love.

1348
02:26:36,878 --> 02:26:39,039
Look what he is doing when I am
speaking about them?

1349
02:26:42,416 --> 02:26:45,943
Marriage... it is just a word
with a few letters in it

1350
02:26:49,056 --> 02:26:50,887
But this word has the power...
the magic.

1351
02:26:55,428 --> 02:26:56,019
It brings people together
who are strangers

1352
02:26:58,898 --> 02:27:01,594
So many times we may think,
everything is under our control

1353
02:27:03,068 --> 02:27:08,267
We may see a person, like him,
love him and try to have him

1354
02:27:09,074 --> 02:27:12,271
Sometimes we may lose them...
but life doesn't end there.

1355
02:27:14,278 --> 02:27:16,542
Our partners aren't decided by us

1356
02:27:17,248 --> 02:27:20,547
We may live with whom we like or
with the person who likes us

1357
02:27:22,052 --> 02:27:23,076
Or we may live just like that!

1358
02:27:24,421 --> 02:27:30,291
Can we choose our parents? We may
dream to be children of great people

1359
02:27:35,431 --> 02:27:38,525
Rain! At least can we wish,
for it to rain when we need?

1360
02:27:39,101 --> 02:27:41,001
When it rains we need to run for shelter.

1361
02:27:49,377 --> 02:27:56,943
It is not fair to marry whom you like
at the cost of your beloved ones

1362
02:27:58,952 --> 02:28:03,446
If we don't get our loved ones then
it's better to love whom you get.

1363
02:28:09,628 --> 02:28:11,619
I wish Asha should be strong and
should hit Mohan daily.

1364
02:29:10,883 --> 02:29:15,377
"Can't you say once 'you liked me"'

1365
02:29:17,789 --> 02:29:22,852
"Can't we unite and share happiness"

1366
02:29:23,795 --> 02:29:25,956
"Our thoughts are alike"

1367
02:29:27,298 --> 02:29:29,960
"Our dreams are alike"

1368
02:29:31,068 --> 02:29:36,700
"This is the right time
for us to unite"

1369
02:29:37,641 --> 02:29:42,669
"You know the past and the future,
but still want to be with me?"

1370
02:29:43,980 --> 02:29:49,475
"Uniting with you is
impossible for me"

1371
02:30:23,615 --> 02:30:26,015
"You can't catch the moon"

1372
02:30:26,351 --> 02:30:29,445
"You need to know it before"

1373
02:30:30,389 --> 02:30:32,687
"Instead of teaching young ones, you
are making the mistake of catching it"

1374
02:30:36,827 --> 02:30:42,094
"If you can't fulfill you dreams,
you can't ever do then in future

1375
02:30:43,099 --> 02:30:49,038
"Can you say to your young ones
that you are failure in life"

1376
02:30:49,472 --> 02:30:52,032
"Dreams can't be practical"

1377
02:30:52,442 --> 02:30:55,536
"Why do you want to compare
dreams in real life"

1378
02:30:55,878 --> 02:31:02,374
"When I am there in front of you
why can't you accept me?"

1379
02:31:42,654 --> 02:31:45,214
"Isn't my beauty tempting to you?"

1380
02:31:45,490 --> 02:31:48,687
"What else do you need in a girl"

1381
02:31:48,892 --> 02:31:55,092
"When you have the passion for me
why can't you show it out"

1382
02:31:55,532 --> 02:31:59,093
"Though you are beautiful"

1383
02:31:59,435 --> 02:32:04,964
"My pains in life are as
high as sky and deep as sea

1384
02:32:05,108 --> 02:32:08,134
"I'm torn apart between
love and responsibility"

1385
02:32:08,443 --> 02:32:11,571
"Where there is will there is a way"

1386
02:32:11,747 --> 02:32:14,773
"If you wish to do it,
you can do it"

1387
02:32:15,117 --> 02:32:20,646
"Can't we think this is our
fate and accept the facts"

1388
02:33:37,888 --> 02:33:44,919
Why do you love me? Once you are so
near, sometimes you are a stranger

1389
02:33:47,029 --> 02:33:52,331
Sometimes I feel like sharing
everything, sometimes I am so scared.

1390
02:33:52,468 --> 02:33:53,230
Why?

1391
02:33:55,237 --> 02:33:56,898
You give me the pain and
also you console me

1392
02:33:57,539 --> 02:33:59,404
You make me laugh sometimes
and sometimes cry

1393
02:33:59,574 --> 02:34:02,975
Why are you torturing me?
Why are you making me mad?

1394
02:34:04,044 --> 02:34:05,409
Why did you come into my life?
Why do you do this to me?

1395
02:35:24,584 --> 02:35:28,486
Look, the food must be excellent.
Else I'll not give you a pie.

1396
02:35:29,322 --> 02:35:30,619
Who is she?
- The cook

1397
02:35:33,159 --> 02:35:34,990
Does she cook or eat?
- If she listens she'll kick you.

1398
02:35:37,496 --> 02:35:38,758
She is...?
- My wife.

1399
02:35:39,331 --> 02:35:40,593
Just want to ask you one thing.

1400
02:35:40,765 --> 02:35:42,255
Apart from height, you can say
anything. I'll not feel bad.

1401
02:35:46,471 --> 02:35:48,302
She was abandoned and
hence she got married to me.

1402
02:35:50,607 --> 02:35:51,335
Look who is here?

1403
02:35:55,279 --> 02:35:59,682
What are you thinking? You thought
I'll miss this marriage.

1404
02:36:01,017 --> 02:36:05,078
I have seen your marriage and now
it's my daughter's marriage!

1405
02:36:05,254 --> 02:36:10,351
Ladies are always in urgency
be it marriage or being mother

1406
02:36:13,729 --> 02:36:15,629
Where's our bride?
- She's upstairs.

1407
02:36:56,734 --> 02:37:01,068
What is all this?
- After a long time Shekar is coming

1408
02:37:01,205 --> 02:37:03,070
So a small welcome party for him.

1409
02:37:03,640 --> 02:37:08,202
If you want to have a say directly,
why do you want to make excuses

1410
02:37:08,845 --> 02:37:13,407
What do think I am a drunkard?
- Isn't it the truth?

1411
02:37:14,250 --> 02:37:18,619
Look, I had told before the marriage
I've this habit. So why did you marry?

1412
02:37:19,355 --> 02:37:22,586
Like other girls, I thought I can
stop you after marriage...

1413
02:37:23,726 --> 02:37:26,786
You are so confident?
- At that time, I used to feel so.

1414
02:37:28,096 --> 02:37:29,393
What do you feel now?

1415
02:37:29,664 --> 02:37:34,363
Rather than stopping you,
I should start drinking

1416
02:37:41,275 --> 02:37:42,674
Wait.
- What happened?

1417
02:37:44,111 --> 02:37:46,102
Are you coming directly or have
you visited my outhouse first?

1418
02:37:46,279 --> 02:37:49,271
If I would have visited there first,
then why would I carry this?

1419
02:37:50,450 --> 02:37:52,714
Didn't I tell you that he'll see me
first and then his son

1420
02:37:52,852 --> 02:37:54,444
You didn't believe me then... Now see.

1421
02:37:55,621 --> 02:37:59,614
How many years have passed?
You have such a big tummy?

1422
02:38:01,460 --> 02:38:03,758
How are you brother?
- I'm fine. How are you?

1423
02:38:03,929 --> 02:38:06,921
I'm fine.
- Is my son troubling you?

1424
02:38:07,264 --> 02:38:11,428
He is my boy, He is taking
care of all of my jobs.

1425
02:38:12,303 --> 02:38:15,466
When did he become so smart?
- He is smart since childhood.

1426
02:38:15,639 --> 02:38:19,234
But you don't trust him.
- I'll get coffee for you both.

1427
02:38:19,409 --> 02:38:23,607
Not coffee, send some soda.
- Shut up, send us some good coffee.

1428
02:38:25,215 --> 02:38:29,151
Trying to be a gentleman?
- Want to drink on such a day?

1429
02:38:29,651 --> 02:38:33,280
Advice him properly
- No matter what, we'll have drinks.

1430
02:38:34,456 --> 02:38:37,516
You'll never change.
- Uncle someone has come from office

1431
02:38:38,593 --> 02:38:40,686
I'll be back in five minutes.
- Okay

1432
02:38:53,173 --> 02:38:55,164
What are you doing?
- Digging hole for a tent.

1433
02:38:55,342 --> 02:38:57,867
It's too big, try with a spoon instead

1434
02:39:00,446 --> 02:39:01,435
Idiot, go and get a crowbar.

1435
02:39:04,517 --> 02:39:05,677
How are you?

1436
02:39:09,988 --> 02:39:13,185
Couldn't see you? Maybe you
were busy with the marriage

1437
02:39:15,693 --> 02:39:17,854
You need flowers, I'll send it.

1438
02:39:19,864 --> 02:39:25,200
How can you act so coolly?
As though nothing has happened

1439
02:39:25,369 --> 02:39:30,500
How can you be so normal.
Everybody can't be like you.

1440
02:39:30,674 --> 02:39:36,704
She is crying for you helplessly.
I am not blaming you.

1441
02:39:37,713 --> 02:39:42,377
She is at fault. If she falls in love
after getting engaged it's a mistake

1442
02:39:43,718 --> 02:39:44,548
And it was a bigger mistake to
reveal her feelings to you.

1443
02:39:50,559 --> 02:39:53,392
She is innocent. You're a good man.
Just to follow some customs...

1444
02:39:53,561 --> 02:39:57,554
You want her to marry at
the cost of her life.

1445
02:39:57,731 --> 02:39:59,562
That is why I am unable
to speak to you.

1446
02:40:01,035 --> 02:40:03,765
I couldn't stand in front
of your greatness

1447
02:40:05,438 --> 02:40:07,804
Why do you men behave so heartlessly?

1448
02:40:08,708 --> 02:40:13,771
If a woman says she will die for you,
can't you at least console her.

1449
02:40:15,647 --> 02:40:19,048
Do you think running around for your
lover's marriage is a great sacrifice?

1450
02:40:19,918 --> 02:40:24,651
Remember one thing, customs
are born after us.

1451
02:40:26,757 --> 02:40:29,920
She may not commit suicide if she
doesn't get married to you.

1452
02:40:31,362 --> 02:40:37,767
But till she dies, she'll cry for you
and you'll be responsible for that

1453
02:40:54,950 --> 02:40:56,645
Daddy, when did you come?

1454
02:41:14,801 --> 02:41:16,234
I'll be back in a moment

1455
02:41:26,545 --> 02:41:28,638
Complete the work soon.
- How is he?

1456
02:41:30,582 --> 02:41:35,610
He was a kid with me, now he is a man
- Come.

1457
02:41:42,493 --> 02:41:44,791
Aren't you asking how he is?

1458
02:41:46,997 --> 02:41:51,957
That should be asked if he is unhappy.
He looks happy, hence no need to ask

1459
02:41:52,835 --> 02:41:57,932
You are correct... Have you arranged
for the bridegroom's family?

1460
02:41:58,541 --> 02:42:01,032
I have arranged for it.
- What about their dinner?

1461
02:42:02,010 --> 02:42:04,638
I have arranged for catering,
they'll take orders from them.

1462
02:42:06,081 --> 02:42:08,572
What else?
- Tent decoration starts tomorrow,

1463
02:42:09,384 --> 02:42:12,046
I've ordered for flowers, hotel rooms
have been booked for groom's friends

1464
02:42:12,853 --> 02:42:18,917
A videographer will be with them
throughout till the marriage hall

1465
02:42:21,795 --> 02:42:27,097
Enough, you and your father are
here... What else do I need?

1466
02:42:31,103 --> 02:42:35,472
You do as you like, but the groom's
relatives should be happy

1467
02:42:38,043 --> 02:42:41,740
Murthy's daughter's marriage should
be the talk of the town.

1468
02:42:43,848 --> 02:42:47,409
Call me in the end, I'll be
there to bless her.

1469
02:43:11,173 --> 02:43:13,004
Is this the bride's house?
- It's the marriage hall.

1470
02:43:14,008 --> 02:43:17,739
Who are you? Speaking without respect
- I didn't speak yet.

1471
02:43:18,780 --> 02:43:25,083
Is it a custom not to speak with us?
- Can you please teach me customs?

1472
02:43:25,753 --> 02:43:29,416
Fold your hands, bow your head
stand a foot away and...

1473
02:43:29,590 --> 02:43:31,114
What to do you need?
- What is your name?

1474
02:43:34,827 --> 02:43:36,419
Does that mean a round ball?
- Yes sir,

1475
02:43:36,529 --> 02:43:38,827
Did they name you after you were born
or were you born after being named?

1476
02:43:38,965 --> 02:43:40,956
Even I have doubts.
- Coffee is available

1477
02:43:41,100 --> 02:43:42,226
Yes it is
- How is it?

1478
02:43:42,602 --> 02:43:44,035
It's hot.
- What else is there?

1479
02:43:51,843 --> 02:43:54,641
The aforesaid items are not there.
Only complan is available, take it.

1480
02:44:08,792 --> 02:44:10,623
You don't have to say anything
I'll leave.

1481
02:44:11,795 --> 02:44:15,822
But before that tell me do
you love me or not?

1482
02:44:17,800 --> 02:44:22,464
If you say "Yes", I'll marry
as you wish.

1483
02:44:24,540 --> 02:44:28,636
If you say "No", I'll think to love
is wrong and marry in shame.

1484
02:44:29,977 --> 02:44:30,841
But please tell the truth.

1485
02:44:40,754 --> 02:44:43,655
Why this is happening?
Why it is happening only to me.

1486
02:44:45,025 --> 02:44:48,188
You want love,
my father wants prestige.

1487
02:44:48,562 --> 02:44:54,660
My father wants you all,
this marriage must go on

1488
02:44:55,501 --> 02:44:57,059
You have to leave.
You have to forget me.

1489
02:45:04,843 --> 02:45:08,779
Don't take decisions in haste
- I've thought enough. I'll not marry

1490
02:45:10,013 --> 02:45:10,672
Just looking at this photo you
are breaking this marriage?

1491
02:45:10,848 --> 02:45:13,612
What else do you need to
prove her character

1492
02:45:14,585 --> 02:45:19,852
I'll cancel it, I'll look for another
if she is also like this girl?

1493
02:45:24,527 --> 02:45:27,860
If she loves somebody now, then you
love somebody else after marriage

1494
02:45:28,264 --> 02:45:28,923
Just shut up

1495
02:45:32,968 --> 02:45:35,129
Just for one small reason we should
not be fools to break the marriage

1496
02:45:35,871 --> 02:45:38,032
Her weakness will be our strength
after the marriage.

1497
02:45:45,045 --> 02:45:47,639
Defective saris are sold
for lesser price but...

1498
02:45:49,216 --> 02:45:56,349
defective brides are bought
for higher value.

1499
02:45:59,225 --> 02:46:06,563
Don't understand? We'll show photo,
demand more money from her father

1500
02:46:09,735 --> 02:46:17,005
Sail with the wind! Agree for the
marriage. I'll take care of the rest

1501
02:46:24,214 --> 02:46:28,014
Get out!
- You need to comply slightly.

1502
02:46:28,218 --> 02:46:31,244
Who are you to tell me that?
- Your anger will cost you dearly.

1503
02:46:31,855 --> 02:46:33,789
Your daughter is at fault
and you are yelling at us?

1504
02:46:35,257 --> 02:46:37,885
Another word against her,
I'll slaughter you

1505
02:46:38,327 --> 02:46:42,923
We don't blame ladies without proof

1506
02:46:52,273 --> 02:46:54,867
To retain prestige we are asking
you more money, but had it been..

1507
02:46:55,209 --> 02:46:57,939
someone else, they would have
broken this marriage

1508
02:46:58,278 --> 02:47:01,076
What are you looking at that?
See what should happen next

1509
02:47:01,248 --> 02:47:07,209
Decide, we've to go to marriage hall
or railway station. Think carefully!

1510
02:47:07,887 --> 02:47:08,353
Come let's leave.

1511
02:47:17,295 --> 02:47:18,626
Bridegroom's guest are leaving...

1512
02:47:23,868 --> 02:47:31,639
I am at fault. I liked him. When I
realised my mistake, I became silent

1513
02:47:42,986 --> 02:47:49,653
What's happening in this house?
Couldn't you be alert and careful

1514
02:47:51,326 --> 02:47:56,263
They are showing this snap and are
demanding for more money.

1515
02:47:59,834 --> 02:48:03,895
Should I give? If I give it is good
as accepting that she is guilty

1516
02:48:05,906 --> 02:48:08,238
Should I accept?
- Mother is not at fault.

1517
02:48:08,376 --> 02:48:10,776
Shut up. I hate to talk to you.
- Brother.

1518
02:48:11,277 --> 02:48:13,370
Don't interrupt.
- Please listen to me.

1519
02:48:13,680 --> 02:48:18,242
What will you tell? She is engaged
and how could she do it?

1520
02:48:19,285 --> 02:48:23,016
Who can say when will
a person fall in love?

1521
02:48:26,859 --> 02:48:29,987
If we would have known about it then
your daughter wouldn't be a culprit

1522
02:48:31,496 --> 02:48:38,698
So she can fall in love after being
engaged? Does she has any culture?

1523
02:48:42,372 --> 02:48:47,241
She is in love, yet she is marrying
the man whom you've chosen

1524
02:48:49,212 --> 02:48:58,143
Someone told you about her love, else
her love would have remained a secret

1525
02:48:58,988 --> 02:49:08,260
You may spend millions on marriage
but people forget it, the next day

1526
02:49:09,330 --> 02:49:15,235
But your daughter has to lead her
entire life with that man. Think once

1527
02:49:15,469 --> 02:49:21,066
Are you guests important to you or
is it the man who is marrying her?

1528
02:49:21,775 --> 02:49:26,474
I agree it is man marrying her.
Tell me why she loves him?

1529
02:49:27,246 --> 02:49:28,736
What did she see in him? How was
he better than the guy I chose

1530
02:49:28,915 --> 02:49:33,784
Name one thing of him, better than guy
I chose, I'll call off the marriage.

1531
02:49:33,953 --> 02:49:39,914
She can't tell that. Not only she,
nobody can answer this question.

1532
02:49:41,059 --> 02:49:46,497
You may get an answer for all your
likings be it place, colour, food...

1533
02:49:48,365 --> 02:49:56,238
but to love or hate a man... you
can't find exact reason for it.

1534
02:49:56,439 --> 02:50:00,933
Just mention one thing about him
better than Prasad...

1535
02:50:01,277 --> 02:50:01,936
Brother?
- Don't tell me anything.

1536
02:50:02,178 --> 02:50:09,448
Nobody will ask if the girl
knows culture or customs

1537
02:50:09,585 --> 02:50:13,954
But I need to answer people, if
bridegroom has necessary qualities

1538
02:50:15,824 --> 02:50:16,449
Where is Venky?

1539
02:50:24,298 --> 02:50:27,529
What happened? Why are you leaving
before to marriage?

1540
02:50:28,468 --> 02:50:30,834
Were you treated badly, is there any
drawback? You name it I'll give it.

1541
02:50:36,476 --> 02:50:39,912
Tell me what you want. Tell me your
problem I'll solve it at any cost

1542
02:50:40,146 --> 02:50:41,807
You are the problem.
- Me. I am the problem?

1543
02:50:43,315 --> 02:50:46,375
Don't act innocent. We know what's
going on between you and her

1544
02:50:46,986 --> 02:50:50,581
What are you speaking about?
What's there between me and her?

1545
02:50:59,396 --> 02:51:00,328
How...? I don't know
anything about this daddy.

1546
02:51:03,333 --> 02:51:11,001
Don't believe it. There's nothing
between us. I swear it on my mother

1547
02:51:12,441 --> 02:51:14,409
You don't know daddy... please be
quiet. Leave me only for this

1548
02:51:16,012 --> 02:51:18,003
He's young blood and decided in haste.
Being elder you can decide properly.

1549
02:51:21,283 --> 02:51:23,945
Do you think only he has prestige?
- I didn't say that.

1550
02:51:24,119 --> 02:51:26,349
Why do want to talk to him?
- Please listen to me...

1551
02:51:26,488 --> 02:51:29,616
How many times to tell you?
She is a characterless girl

1552
02:51:34,195 --> 02:51:37,187
Don't speak rot. Please listen to me

1553
02:51:41,035 --> 02:51:44,334
She is good and innocent.
- You are giving me a certificate

1554
02:51:44,938 --> 02:51:46,405
Why do you bother when her father
is not worried of her.

1555
02:51:48,374 --> 02:51:51,639
No matter what, I will not agree.
- Her life would be spoilt.

1556
02:51:51,944 --> 02:51:55,107
The entire family will be insulted
and laughed at. I beg at your feet

1557
02:51:56,548 --> 02:52:01,383
People will think I am a villain.
- He insulted us, you beg for him?

1558
02:52:03,020 --> 02:52:05,955
You scold me but please
don't abandon us

1559
02:52:07,391 --> 02:52:12,055
I can't repeat the same thing.
Get lost

1560
02:52:16,967 --> 02:52:20,494
I'll ensure that she'll not
get married to any one else

1561
02:52:22,172 --> 02:52:24,231
She is great lady... and you are
a recommendation for her?

1562
02:52:43,458 --> 02:52:46,086
Who is that fellow who can't
stop when asked decently?

1563
02:52:46,560 --> 02:52:47,254
You are threatening us?

1564
02:52:50,530 --> 02:52:53,021
Anybody moves from here...
I'll chop their legs.

1565
02:52:55,202 --> 02:52:56,533
Have guts? Ask me...

1566
02:52:58,938 --> 02:53:02,533
You're proud because you live in
America? Can you compete with me?

1567
02:53:04,110 --> 02:53:08,342
Nobody is leaving from here
without the marriage

1568
02:53:12,117 --> 02:53:15,951
I don't care for blood shed.
Take your suitcase

1569
02:53:22,126 --> 02:53:25,527
You leave, sir. They'll come.
...take the suitcase.

1570
02:53:27,463 --> 02:53:29,454
This marriage will take place.
- Let them go.

1571
02:53:32,235 --> 02:53:34,635
No.
- This is another drama?

1572
02:53:37,307 --> 02:53:42,040
Don't beg them. Though they are rich,
they still beg for money

1573
02:53:42,177 --> 02:53:46,477
This great man is nowhere near
the watchman of our house

1574
02:53:47,316 --> 02:53:50,581
Don't beg them. Get lost.
- Let's leave.

1575
02:53:57,725 --> 02:54:02,628
Why did you cheat me?
- You are speaking like them...?

1576
02:54:03,330 --> 02:54:08,131
Don't you love Nandu? Look into
my eyes and tell the truth.

1577
02:54:13,806 --> 02:54:20,507
I love her. I haven't told her
but I'm telling you

1578
02:54:21,579 --> 02:54:24,742
I told you since you said I cheated,
else I wouldn't have told anybody

1579
02:54:26,384 --> 02:54:31,378
Aren't you cheating me by hiding it.
Is he anyway better than you?

1580
02:54:37,027 --> 02:54:41,157
I thought you as my family member,
but you neglected me.

1581
02:54:42,198 --> 02:54:48,603
I loved her. But my love compared
to yours, I felt very humble. So...

1582
02:54:52,540 --> 02:54:59,036
My father advised me not to do any
thing that would harm friendship.

1583
02:55:01,349 --> 02:55:06,082
I thought you both shouldn't be
asking forgiveness because of me.

1584
02:55:14,460 --> 02:55:19,397
I was seeing if guy was from abroad,
never thought if he is in heart.

1585
02:55:46,222 --> 02:55:48,213
Do it fast.
Hello, came just now?

1586
02:55:49,159 --> 02:55:53,687
I was here in the morning. But had
gone out. Did you get your gift?

1587
02:55:55,597 --> 02:55:58,896
In the water kingdom, don't remember?
- No I don't remember.

1588
02:56:00,369 --> 02:56:06,433
He was like... there he is.
- Bunty, come here.

1589
02:56:07,542 --> 02:56:09,601
Yes sir.
- I gave a cover in the morning?

1590
02:56:09,777 --> 02:56:11,335
He said give it to bridegroom.
I gave it to him.

1591
02:56:11,612 --> 02:56:13,375
So you handed over photos to them?
- Yes sir

1592
02:56:13,581 --> 02:56:16,209
Then you are not the bridegroom?
- Now I am the bridegroom.

1593
02:56:16,350 --> 02:56:18,614
In the morning?
- It was another bridegroom.

1594
02:56:19,619 --> 02:56:21,587
Both of you are getting married?
- Yes, we both are getting married.

1595
02:56:22,622 --> 02:56:24,613
What happened to that bridegroom?
- The marriage broke.

1596
02:56:24,825 --> 02:56:27,453
Now the marriage is between?
- Me and the lady in photo you clicked

1597
02:56:27,693 --> 02:56:29,752
Then why did that marriage break?
- Because of your photo.

1598
02:56:31,864 --> 02:56:37,200
Why should my photo break a marriage?
I'm confused. Tell me in detail.

1599
02:56:38,236 --> 02:56:40,136
It's a big story. First you
please go and have your lunch.

1600
02:56:41,573 --> 02:56:43,939
Bridegroom..?
- Take a right...

1601
02:56:45,143 --> 02:56:46,235
Where are you going?
- I'll show him the way.

1602
02:56:46,377 --> 02:56:50,438
I want to talk to you.
- I didn't know what it contained.

1603
02:56:50,481 --> 02:56:52,745
You just gave it without thinking?

1604
02:56:53,317 --> 02:56:54,750
Have you worn belt?... Remove it.

1605
02:56:57,321 --> 02:56:59,812
I have some work with you. Come here.

1606
02:57:04,160 --> 02:57:06,424
What's it?
- I thought Bunty was here...

1607
02:57:07,263 --> 02:57:10,232
Why he'll come here?
I know for what you are here?

1608
02:57:10,499 --> 02:57:14,492
Don't you have manners? Never enter
a girl's room when she is alone.

1609
02:57:15,470 --> 02:57:16,960
I'm talking to you and
you are leaving?

1610
02:57:20,941 --> 02:57:24,672
Why did you close the door?
What are you doing?

1611
02:57:25,179 --> 02:57:29,479
I'll shout and call everybody.
