1
00:02:41,411 --> 00:02:44,403
Agastya! Do you remember
what day is today?

2
00:02:44,981 --> 00:02:47,916
So farfrom Earth.
What difference does that make?

3
00:02:48,117 --> 00:02:49,516
whether it Monday or Friday...

4
00:02:50,053 --> 00:02:51,452
every day is the same to us.

5
00:02:51,621 --> 00:02:56,354
No stupid! Remember, exactly an year ago,

6
00:02:56,860 --> 00:03:00,489
we left on this mission on 25th August.

7
00:03:02,232 --> 00:03:04,291
25th August! Oh my God!

8
00:03:04,500 --> 00:03:05,364
What happened?

9
00:03:07,270 --> 00:03:09,067
l forgot to call my friend, Suhan.

10
00:03:09,439 --> 00:03:10,701
Today is his birthday.

11
00:03:11,207 --> 00:03:12,105
Suhan?

12
00:03:12,475 --> 00:03:14,204
Yeah! He is an old friend of mine.

13
00:03:14,777 --> 00:03:15,801
From Houston?

14
00:03:16,012 --> 00:03:18,105
No. From Mumbai, lndia.

15
00:03:18,414 --> 00:03:20,974
From lndia? -Yeah.

16

00:03:32,729 --> 00:03:33,559
That's true.

19
00:03:34,831 --> 00:03:37,493
Well. Now that you have a

21
00:03:42,505 --> 00:03:45,338
Well. Where do l start from?

22
00:03:47,076 --> 00:03:51,206

Actually the only person who's really,
really important to me.

35
00:05:51,267 --> 00:05:53,792

This is embarrassing.

49
00:06:25,868 --> 00:06:28,701
Uncle. Uncle l was just talking about you.

50

Uncle will you call me in two minutes?

53
00:06:35,545 --> 00:06:36,569
Uncle.

54
00:06:38,748 --> 00:06:39,510
Dream?

55
00:06:45,888 --> 00:06:46,684
Yes, uncle.

56
00:06:46,889 --> 00:06:48,516

00:06:59,469 --> 00:07:02,438
Suhan! My hero! My superstar!

60
00:07:02,638 --> 00:07:05,163
Uncle, basket.

61
00:07:07,176 --> 00:07:09,974
Uncle, what is the trouble?

62
00:07:10,179 --> 00:07:11,771
That you woke me up early in the morning.

63
00:07:12,415 --> 00:07:13,541
You are right.

64
00:07:17,053 --> 00:07:18,782
Give it to me. Sorry! Sorry!

65
00:07:18,988 --> 00:07:20,046
What were you trying to do?

66
00:07:20,256 --> 00:07:22,417
Sorry, uncle. l was trying to help you.
l won't do it.

67
00:07:22,625 --> 00:07:25,025
You want to help me
because l am a dwarf.

68
00:07:25,228 --> 00:07:27,753
No, uncle! Tell me from where
do you look like a dwarf?

69
00:07:28,030 --> 00:07:30,225
Exactly. You are my real friend.

70
00:07:30,433 --> 00:07:31,024
l know.

71
00:07:33,503 --> 00:07:34,731
Are you the new assistant?

72
00:07:34,937 --> 00:07:36,097
Yes, sir. Pandey.

73
00:07:37,073 --> 00:07:41,635
Mr. Pandey, henceforth knock
before entering my office.

74
00:07:41,911 --> 00:07:43,344
Sorry, Bonny sir.

75
00:07:44,313 --> 00:07:46,247
What did you say? - Bonny sir.

76
00:07:47,283 --> 00:07:50,446
lt's not Bonny sir. lt's Bonney!

77
00:07:50,653 --> 00:07:52,177
l don't know why my parents kept
my name such..

78
00:07:52,388 --> 00:07:53,912
..that it suits my personality.

79
00:07:54,123 --> 00:07:56,921
Bonny! - Bonney!

80
00:07:57,260 --> 00:07:59,023
Bo.. - Okay. You can call me sir.

81
00:07:59,228 --> 00:08:00,252
Okay, sir. Sir!

82
00:08:01,197 --> 00:08:02,721
Don't you sit down! Stand up! Stand up!

83
00:08:02,932 --> 00:08:04,729
Don't ever sit down in front of me. Okay. - Sir.

84
00:08:04,934 --> 00:08:06,959
Yeah. - Sir, this is the bona fide certificate.

85
00:08:08,304 --> 00:08:10,864
What certificate?
- Sir, bona fide certificate.

86
00:08:11,073 --> 00:08:14,042
lt's not bona fide.
lt's bonafide certificate.

87
00:08:14,243 --> 00:08:16,268
Even l can see that.
But what are these for?

88
00:08:16,479 --> 00:08:17,605
Mr. Bawarchee.

89
00:08:21,384 --> 00:08:26,913
Mr. Pandey.. are you doing this deliberately?

90
00:08:27,123 --> 00:08:28,454
What, sir?

91
00:08:29,258 --> 00:08:30,486
Because you know that l..

92
00:08:31,327 --> 00:08:32,351
Sir, you what?

93
00:08:32,562 --> 00:08:35,963
Because l am.. because l am.. -You?

94
00:08:36,165 --> 00:08:37,257
Because l am a dwarf.

95
00:08:37,500 --> 00:08:40,025
Sir, how can you even imagine this!

96
00:08:40,236 --> 00:08:40,793
Sir, l can't even imagine this!

97
00:08:41,003 --> 00:08:44,530
Okay! Okay! Relax! Don't get emotional.

98
00:08:50,246 --> 00:08:51,474
Bonney Singh. Okay.

99
00:08:53,182 --> 00:08:53,978
Thank you, sir.

100
00:08:55,685 --> 00:08:56,709
Sir..

101
00:08:57,620 --> 00:08:58,780
Yes, Mr. Pandey.

102
00:08:59,021 --> 00:09:00,613
Sir, today l need a half-day leave.

103
00:09:00,823 --> 00:09:03,951
Of course! Of course!
Why do you need a leave?

104
00:09:04,160 --> 00:09:06,890
Sir, my car has broken down.
lts bonnet has broken.

105
00:09:09,865 --> 00:09:13,232
Bonnet? Get out! Get out!

106
00:09:18,107 --> 00:09:20,268
No need to hide your laughter, dear.

107
00:09:20,543 --> 00:09:22,238
Very soon these tears of happiness..

108
00:09:22,445 --> 00:09:24,675
..are going to be converted
into tears of sorrow.

109
00:09:25,381 --> 00:09:26,075
No!

110
00:09:27,917 --> 00:09:31,080
A notice had come today in the morning.

111
00:09:35,057 --> 00:09:36,285
Of Piya's lawyer.

112
00:09:37,260 --> 00:09:42,288
Ayear ago Mr. Suhan Kapoor and
Ms. Piya Goyal had divorced.

113
00:09:42,498 --> 00:09:46,434
The court had declared that
every month on the 1st..

114
00:09:46,636 --> 00:09:49,469
..the husband Suhan Kapoor
will send a cheque of 25,000..

115
00:09:49,672 --> 00:09:54,405
..as alimony to his wife Piya Goyal.

116
00:09:54,610 --> 00:09:57,545
But even after a year Suhan Kapoor..

117
00:09:57,747 --> 00:10:02,013
..has not sent even a single cheque of
alimony to Piya Goyal.

118
00:10:02,551 --> 00:10:05,349
Because of Suhan Kapoor's
carelessness Piya Goyal..

119
00:10:05,554 --> 00:10:09,786
..had to undergo tremendous financial,
physical and mental stress.

120
00:10:10,026 --> 00:10:13,052
Because it has been proved
that Piya Goyal..

121
00:10:13,262 --> 00:10:16,720
..can't depend on Suhan Kapoor every month..

122
00:10:16,932 --> 00:10:21,494
..so Piya Goyal demands
a one time settlement..

123
00:10:21,704 --> 00:10:26,368
..of 50 lakhs as an alimony
from Suhan Kapoor.

124
00:10:28,344 --> 00:10:30,039
50 lakhs!

125
00:10:30,379 --> 00:10:34,509
You have one month's time to
repay the settlement amount.

126
00:10:37,053 --> 00:10:39,749
Suhan! Suhan! Suhan!

127
00:10:42,692 --> 00:10:43,317
Catch the ball!

128
00:11:00,776 --> 00:11:01,435
Uncle!

129
00:11:02,745 --> 00:11:04,940
l had heard that poison is
used to treat poison.

130
00:11:05,281 --> 00:11:07,613
But shock is used to treat shock..

131
00:11:07,817 --> 00:11:09,114
..l am seeing it forthe first time.

132
00:11:09,318 --> 00:11:12,446
50 lakhs! Uncle,
from where will l get 50 lakhs?

133
00:11:12,655 --> 00:11:14,418
l don't have enough money to even pay..

134
00:11:14,623 --> 00:11:15,214
..the telephone and electricity bill.

135
00:11:15,424 --> 00:11:17,221
l have not paid my house rent
forthe past 3 months.

136
00:11:17,426 --> 00:11:18,916
This has no connection with the law.

137
00:11:19,128 --> 00:11:20,459
Law had decided the amount.

138
00:11:20,663 --> 00:11:22,563
And you have not paid
a single penny to Piya.

139
00:11:22,765 --> 00:11:25,859
But uncle, Piya doesn't need money.

140
00:11:26,068 --> 00:11:28,434
l don't have work.
She should be giving me the alimony.

141
00:11:28,637 --> 00:11:31,105
But when you got divorced,
at that time you had work..

142
00:11:31,307 --> 00:11:32,274
..and Piya had no work.

143
00:11:32,475 --> 00:11:33,999
Correct! Correct!

144
00:11:34,510 --> 00:11:36,740
But now the tables have turned.

145
00:11:36,946 --> 00:11:38,470
She has work.
That too in New York.

146
00:11:38,681 --> 00:11:41,479
She is earning in dollars.
Uncle, l have no work.

147
00:11:41,684 --> 00:11:44,744
So we have to go to the court
and re-evaluate this case.

148
00:11:44,954 --> 00:11:47,855
And you will have to get me
the alimony. Correct.

149
00:11:48,090 --> 00:11:49,250
Really? How much?

150
00:11:49,592 --> 00:11:51,150
l think 50,000 per month is fine.

151
00:11:51,360 --> 00:11:52,987
50,000! l will strangulate you!

152
00:11:53,195 --> 00:11:54,492
Why? You didn't like my idea?

153
00:11:54,697 --> 00:11:57,165
Not at all! At least some time
take your work seriously.

154
00:11:57,466 --> 00:11:58,763
This is a court case.

155
00:11:58,968 --> 00:12:01,163
You have not given a single penny..

156
00:12:01,370 --> 00:12:02,701
..to Piya in the past one-year as alimony.

157
00:12:02,905 --> 00:12:04,668
lf you will go to the court,
then you yourself will get stuck.

158
00:12:06,475 --> 00:12:09,444
Uncle, what should l do? l don't get any work.

159
00:12:09,945 --> 00:12:11,105
Whatever money l had, l spent that..

160
00:12:11,313 --> 00:12:13,281
..on bodybuilding and photo session.

161
00:12:13,716 --> 00:12:15,274
Where will l get 50 lakhs?

162
00:12:15,484 --> 00:12:17,145
Dear, you will have to arrange
forthe money.

163
00:12:17,353 --> 00:12:19,548
Otherwise you will have
to rot in the prison.

164
00:12:22,892 --> 00:12:24,120
l will not go to the prison.

165
00:12:24,360 --> 00:12:28,160
lf l went to prison..
then my dream of becoming..

166
00:12:28,364 --> 00:12:30,491
..a super star will be completely shattered.

167
00:12:30,699 --> 00:12:32,963
l will somehow survive. But you won't.

168
00:12:33,202 --> 00:12:36,000
l will think of a brilliant idea.

169
00:12:37,473 --> 00:12:38,735
l could have never imagined!

170
00:12:38,941 --> 00:12:41,603
l could have never imagined that
Piya would behave like this!

171
00:12:42,411 --> 00:12:43,378
l don't know what have l done that..

172
00:12:43,579 --> 00:12:44,273
..she is taking revenge from me!

173
00:12:45,381 --> 00:12:46,712
She wants to send me to prison.

174
00:12:47,082 --> 00:12:48,379
What is this?

175
00:12:48,584 --> 00:12:49,380
l am showing you the flashback.

176
00:12:49,585 --> 00:12:51,678
So that you will get a rough idea about my life.

177
00:12:51,921 --> 00:12:55,755
People who live for love they are lucky.

178
00:12:56,559 --> 00:13:00,051
People who die for love they too are strange.

179
00:13:01,263 --> 00:13:04,562
My saga is precious. Beloved.

180
00:13:05,634 --> 00:13:09,229
We are away and still we are near.

181
00:13:14,109 --> 00:13:17,943
''l know..''

182
00:13:20,449 --> 00:13:24,613
''Love is naive.''

183
00:13:26,021 --> 00:13:34,258
''Heart tends to make mistakes.''

184
00:13:35,231 --> 00:13:40,760
''Love is oblivious of patience.''

185
00:13:54,717 --> 00:13:59,017
''l know that love is naive.''

186
00:13:59,221 --> 00:14:05,956
''Heart tends to make mistakes.''

187
00:14:06,161 --> 00:14:10,621
''Love is oblivious of patience.''

188
00:14:13,002 --> 00:14:17,371
''l know that love is naive.''

189
00:14:17,573 --> 00:14:24,206
''Heart tends to make mistakes.''

00:14:24,413 --> 00:14:29,646
''Love is oblivious of patience.''

191
00:14:58,981 --> 00:15:01,040
''Beloved.''

192
00:15:01,250 --> 00:15:03,377
''Beloved.''

193
00:15:03,586 --> 00:15:05,577
''Beloved.''

194
00:15:05,788 --> 00:15:08,086
''Beloved.''

195
00:15:08,290 --> 00:15:10,758
lf you had not given me the stupid idea..

196
00:15:10,960 --> 00:15:12,860
..of eloping with Piya that night..

197
00:15:13,062 --> 00:15:14,654
..then today my plight
wouldn't have been this.

198
00:15:14,863 --> 00:15:16,626
l couldn't see your plight.

199
00:15:16,966 --> 00:15:18,934
What did l know that Piya would
turn out to be like this?

200
00:15:19,301 --> 00:15:20,734
She looked so innocent.

201
00:15:26,942 --> 00:15:30,708
''What happened that is
the norm of the society.''

202
00:15:30,913 --> 00:15:34,713
''Mom didn't agree.''

203
00:15:35,417 --> 00:15:38,875
''Dad was angry.''

204
00:15:40,022 --> 00:15:44,459
''That was the sign of my downfall.''

205
00:15:44,660 --> 00:15:49,063
''This was the only style of love.''

206
00:15:49,264 --> 00:15:51,255
''They became angry.''

207
00:15:51,467 --> 00:15:53,560
''And we became rebels.''

208
00:15:53,769 --> 00:15:59,173
''We were fervent and we escaped.''

209
00:16:01,744 --> 00:16:11,710
bT

210
00:16:51,126 --> 00:16:55,654
''l know that love is naive.''

211
00:16:55,864 --> 00:17:02,292
''Heart.. - Tends to make mistakes.''

212
00:17:02,504 --> 00:17:07,203
''Love is oblivious of patience.''

213
00:17:51,220 --> 00:17:52,414
''Hey.''

214
00:17:53,088 --> 00:17:54,578
''Hey.''

''Hey.''

221
00:18:09,505 --> 00:18:11,268
My hero? No, no.

222
00:18:11,473 --> 00:18:14,203
Sir. Sir, did you call me?

223
00:18:14,409 --> 00:18:15,637
Hold on.

224
00:18:16,879 --> 00:18:18,676
The assistant said that you are married.

225
00:18:18,881 --> 00:18:22,044
Yes, sir. The girl who had come
in the office with me.

226
00:18:22,251 --> 00:18:24,481
Sir, she is my wife. Piya.

227
00:18:24,686 --> 00:18:25,482
Your wife?

228
00:18:25,687 --> 00:18:27,814
lf the public comes to know that
my hero is a married man..

229
00:18:28,023 --> 00:18:29,388
..then who will come to watch my movie?

230
00:18:29,591 --> 00:18:31,286
l'll lose millions.

231
00:18:31,460 --> 00:18:34,395
lf l knew you were married,
l wouldn't have signed you.

232
00:18:34,630 --> 00:18:37,190
You've to hide the fact
that you're married.

233
00:18:37,366 --> 00:18:41,166
You've to stay away from your wife
till the film is released.

234
00:18:41,804 --> 00:18:43,271
Okay, sir.

235
00:18:46,108 --> 00:18:47,439
Are we going somewhere?

236
00:18:53,182 --> 00:18:57,619
''l am worried about one helplessness.''

237
00:18:57,820 --> 00:19:02,223
''You will be sad to know it.
But l am with you.''

238
00:19:02,424 --> 00:19:06,758
''l will have to stay away from you.''

239
00:19:06,962 --> 00:19:11,194
''lt's a matter of only a couple of months.
Please endure it.''

240
00:19:11,400 --> 00:19:15,803
''My future, l swear on you.''

241
00:19:16,004 --> 00:19:20,441
''My future is with Piya.''

242
00:19:20,576 --> 00:19:25,013
''l know that love is naive.''

243

bT

246
00:20:32,848 --> 00:20:34,076
l'm ruined.

247
00:20:34,283 --> 00:20:37,684
lt was my mistake to invest
money on you. Superflop hero!

248
00:20:54,069 --> 00:20:59,473
''When l returned back defeated.''

249
00:21:00,242 --> 00:21:03,939
''Back to my home.''

250
00:21:04,880 --> 00:21:08,111
''Piya had already left.''

251
00:21:09,484 --> 00:21:13,887
''She didn't even answer my call.''

252
00:21:14,089 --> 00:21:18,389
''l wrote her letters throughout the year.

253
00:21:18,593 --> 00:21:22,996
''But my voice didn't reach to her.''

254
00:21:23,198 --> 00:21:27,567
''My Piya got lost somewhere.''

255
00:21:27,769 --> 00:21:40,239
''l was hopeful that some day
she will also call me.''

256
00:22:17,252 --> 00:22:27,218
bT

257

''l know that love is naive.''

''Heart tends to make mistakes.''

259
00:22:43,979 --> 00:22:48,313
''Love is oblivious of patience.''

260
00:22:59,127 --> 00:23:00,151
lt fell down.

261
00:23:01,797 --> 00:23:04,391
Your story is very sad.
lt is very emotional.

262
00:23:09,037 --> 00:23:13,098
Even today l don't understand
why she did this to me.

263
00:23:14,576 --> 00:23:19,104
She ditched me at the time
when l needed herthe most.

264
00:23:20,215 --> 00:23:26,120
Women are like this.
You can nevertrust women.

265
00:23:27,722 --> 00:23:32,625
lf you have wealth and fame,
then women will hover around you.

266
00:23:33,728 --> 00:23:39,030
And when you are in trouble,
they will leave you in a lurch.

267
00:23:40,235 --> 00:23:41,702
l understand all these things.

268
00:23:42,537 --> 00:23:44,664
There is only one thing
that l don't understand.

269
00:23:44,873 --> 00:23:47,933
From where will l get 50 lakhs?

270
00:23:49,211 --> 00:23:50,542
Friend, you don't worry about that.

271
00:23:50,745 --> 00:23:52,713
You don't worry about that.

272
00:23:53,181 --> 00:23:55,877
Because the one who has given hunger..

273
00:23:56,751 --> 00:23:58,013
..He will provide you with food too.

274
00:23:58,587 --> 00:23:59,781
Because the one who has given thirst..

275
00:24:00,222 --> 00:24:01,553
...He will provide you with alcohol too.

276
00:24:01,756 --> 00:24:03,553
And the one who has given alcohol,
he will give snacks too.

277
00:24:03,758 --> 00:24:05,919
The one who has given the trouble,
he will solve it too.

278
00:24:06,128 --> 00:24:07,527
We will surely find a scapegoat..

279
00:24:07,729 --> 00:24:09,993
..from whom we will get 50 lakhs.

280
00:24:10,198 --> 00:24:11,130
What scapegoat, uncle?

281
00:24:11,333 --> 00:24:14,894
What scapegoat?
A scapegoat that has 50 lakhs.

282
00:24:15,303 --> 00:24:19,069
Afoolish man who is willing
to give us 50 lakhs.

283
00:24:19,274 --> 00:24:21,640
Afool who will dance to ourtunes.

284
00:24:21,843 --> 00:24:24,573
Afool who will listen to
everything that we say.

285
00:24:24,779 --> 00:24:27,407
An idiot who will do whatever we say.

286
00:24:27,616 --> 00:24:33,782
But from where will we find
such a foolish and idiot person?

287
00:24:36,158 --> 00:24:38,353
Excuse me...the back one.

288
00:24:44,166 --> 00:24:47,226
Listen to me. Sell this house.

289
00:24:47,435 --> 00:24:49,062
This house doesn't belong to my father.

290
00:24:49,437 --> 00:24:51,462
l am a tenant. And forthe last 3 months,
l have not paid the rent.

291
00:24:51,806 --> 00:24:53,239
How much will you get foryour old car?

292
00:24:53,441 --> 00:24:55,409
l already sold it 3 months back for 50 lakhs.

293
00:24:55,610 --> 00:24:56,577
You can't sell your house and car.

294
00:24:56,778 --> 00:24:58,268
Do you have something to sell?

295
00:25:01,283 --> 00:25:02,341
Uncle. -Yes.

296
00:25:04,519 --> 00:25:05,952
How much will l get for my kidney?

297
00:25:06,421 --> 00:25:07,752
Don't talk rubbish.

298
00:25:12,761 --> 00:25:17,824
The one who has nobody, God is with him.

299
00:25:18,033 --> 00:25:22,800
l don't say this. lt is written in the books.

300
00:25:23,004 --> 00:25:25,438
Now only God can save us.

301
00:25:25,640 --> 00:25:28,473
Let's ask God's help.

302
00:25:28,677 --> 00:25:29,644
Help.

303
00:25:31,680 --> 00:25:32,510
Help.

304
00:25:33,415 --> 00:25:37,146
We don't have any other option.

305
00:25:37,552 --> 00:25:40,214
First time l'm asking you something.

306
00:25:40,422 --> 00:25:41,514
No other way too.

307
00:25:41,723 --> 00:25:46,217
Send an Angel who will
solve all our problems.

308
00:25:46,428 --> 00:25:47,292
Please! Please!

309
00:25:54,636 --> 00:25:56,399
Let's see who has come.

310
00:25:58,907 --> 00:26:01,933
Hi Guys. - Hi.

311
00:26:07,282 --> 00:26:10,012
Like this l entered Suhan's life
as an angel.

312
00:26:10,218 --> 00:26:12,948
What are you looking for?
-What are you looking for?

313
00:26:16,725 --> 00:26:18,158
Piya. - Piya?

314
00:26:19,561 --> 00:26:21,392
Piya does not stay here.

315
00:26:22,163 --> 00:26:25,360
But the address says she is here.

316
00:26:26,101 --> 00:26:30,197
Hold it. - Please help the child.
- l am not a child.

317
00:26:30,405 --> 00:26:32,032
Excuse me. - l am sorry uncle.

318
00:26:34,743 --> 00:26:36,904
She does not stay here.
She has been divorced.

319
00:26:37,112 --> 00:26:37,840
Divorce.

320
00:26:40,849 --> 00:26:43,579
Piya cannot go away like this.

321
00:26:44,052 --> 00:26:45,883
How can Piya be compared to that guy?

322
00:26:46,655 --> 00:26:49,954
Piya is anangel and that
man is a bloody animal.

323
00:26:50,325 --> 00:26:52,452
lt's all my mistake,
l shouldn't have let her go.

Yeah. Sure.

352
00:28:33,795 --> 00:28:34,989
How do you know Piya?

353
00:28:36,664 --> 00:28:38,723
You are...?

354
00:28:38,967 --> 00:28:40,457
My name is Suhan Kapoor.

355
00:28:40,668 --> 00:28:42,192
Super Star!

356
00:28:42,404 --> 00:28:45,965
This means you are the new owners
of this house. - Oh yes.

357
00:28:47,142 --> 00:28:50,168
But the way you are asking questions to me..

358
00:28:50,378 --> 00:28:52,642
..as if you know Piya very well.

359
00:28:52,847 --> 00:28:54,474
As if you are her relatives, could be a brother

360
00:28:54,682 --> 00:28:59,483
From yourtalks it looks like
you know Piya's family very well.

361
00:28:59,687 --> 00:29:01,279
Yes. - ls it? - How?

362
00:29:01,489 --> 00:29:05,949
No, l don't know Piya's family,
but l know Piya very well.

363
00:29:06,161 --> 00:29:07,822
She was my girl friend. -What?

364
00:29:08,029 --> 00:29:09,155
Yes, she was my sweet heart?

365
00:29:09,364 --> 00:29:13,664
But, Piya's marriage was going
to be with some one else..

366
00:29:14,469 --> 00:29:18,098
What did l tell you?
She was surely my girl friend..

367
00:29:18,473 --> 00:29:19,838
..but l was not her boy friend. - Oh!

368
00:29:24,312 --> 00:29:27,304
Actually, Piya was surely going to marry me.

369
00:29:29,150 --> 00:29:32,415
But then she married that bull.

370
00:29:32,854 --> 00:29:35,823
Have you seen him?
He looked like King Kong.

371
00:29:36,491 --> 00:29:40,018
l had already said that
Piya can't be happy with that Gorilla.

372
00:29:40,829 --> 00:29:44,094
She was a delicate doll,
and the guy was a hairy bear!

373
00:29:44,299 --> 00:29:46,859
But you did not tell,
how did you know her?

374
00:29:47,869 --> 00:29:49,063
How did l know?

375
00:29:54,175 --> 00:29:56,268
Actually we studied together.

376
00:29:57,278 --> 00:30:01,374
She was the love of my life,
my sweet heart.

377
00:30:03,184 --> 00:30:04,082
Who's snap is this?

378
00:30:06,754 --> 00:30:07,948
This is me and Piya.

379
00:30:09,891 --> 00:30:11,449
That is the only one copy with me.

380
00:30:11,659 --> 00:30:12,751
Keep it carefully.

381
00:30:15,330 --> 00:30:17,525
That was the last time l saw Piya.

382
00:30:19,968 --> 00:30:21,401
She was very happy.

383
00:30:23,104 --> 00:30:27,973
l don't know how she would be now.

384
00:30:28,943 --> 00:30:30,968
No son, don't say like that.

385
00:30:32,480 --> 00:30:37,247
You were saying how Piya was
going to marry you.

386
00:30:38,152 --> 00:30:46,617
Yes. lt is a long story.
lt will take lots of time.

387
00:30:46,828 --> 00:30:49,126
You don't worry about time.
We have enough.

388
00:30:49,330 --> 00:30:50,490
What do you say? -Yes.

389
00:30:51,933 --> 00:30:52,865
l still remember vividly...

390
00:30:54,168 --> 00:30:55,567
My first day in college.

391
00:31:02,443 --> 00:31:06,436
E = mc2. l don't know
how that genius cracked it.

392
00:31:06,648 --> 00:31:12,780
Amazing. Einstein, genius.
What's the time?

393
00:31:12,987 --> 00:31:14,420
Ok, ok. l am going. Bye, bye.

394
00:31:26,000 --> 00:31:26,728
Ouch! Hey!

395
00:31:39,180 --> 00:31:43,139

398
00:32:28,796 --> 00:32:29,820
My foot!

399
00:32:38,539 --> 00:32:39,403
What happened, then?

400
00:32:40,775 --> 00:32:44,108
Days passed away,
we started coming closer..

401
00:32:44,445 --> 00:32:46,208
Me and Piya were like one.

402
00:32:46,781 --> 00:32:52,742
Whatever class, chemistry,
physics.. we sat together.

403
00:32:53,921 --> 00:32:54,819
Then, one day..

404
00:32:55,390 --> 00:32:57,483

405
00:33:07,802 --> 00:33:08,894
Sure, sure. Sure.

406
00:33:12,306 --> 00:33:15,742
Excuse me. Excuse me.

407

But l have seen you always. -What?

485
00:40:41,355 --> 00:40:43,016
''Spread the net, fly away.''

486
00:40:43,190 --> 00:40:45,215

487

''Puts your hands together!''

488
00:40:51,599 --> 00:40:52,998
''Do you want more?''

489
00:41:04,245 --> 00:41:14,211
bT

490
00:41:54,962 --> 00:41:56,827
After listening to such a sad story..

491
00:41:57,498 --> 00:41:59,864
..my eyes water, and my throat is dry.

492
00:42:00,901 --> 00:42:02,698
l will go and get tea.

493
00:42:04,138 --> 00:42:07,972
Shall l get some thing foryou, Champu?
l am sorry.

494
00:42:08,842 --> 00:42:10,901
l entered your character.

495
00:42:11,779 --> 00:42:13,474
Shall l get something foryou, Agastya?

496
00:42:13,881 --> 00:42:17,282
Yeah, l will just have a.. Bourn vita.

497
00:42:17,585 --> 00:42:21,453
lts not Bourn and then Vita.
lt's Bournvita. Ok?

498
00:42:21,889 --> 00:42:23,982
Come. Follow me.

499
00:42:28,596 --> 00:42:31,531
What are you looking for?
Recipe for vita? - Shut up!

500
00:42:34,001 --> 00:42:34,933
Found it!

501
00:42:40,874 --> 00:42:42,136
What did you find uncle, 5 millions?

502
00:42:42,343 --> 00:42:46,109
l did not find 5 million rupees,
but an idea to obtain it.

503
00:42:49,817 --> 00:42:56,985
Now listen carefully. Section 25,
Under Hindu Marriage Act.

504
00:42:57,458 --> 00:42:59,858
After divorce, a husband has to take care..

505
00:43:00,060 --> 00:43:04,190
..of his wife's expenses,
unless she is married again.

506
00:43:04,665 --> 00:43:07,930
Once your Ex-wife remarries..

507
00:43:08,135 --> 00:43:11,195
..then her responsibility
passes to the second husband.

508
00:43:11,639 --> 00:43:16,201
And you.. need not give money
towards expenses.

509
00:43:24,818 --> 00:43:26,479
This means if Piya gets married to Champu..

510
00:43:26,687 --> 00:43:27,949
..then we will get 5 million rupees?

511
00:43:29,256 --> 00:43:31,986
Ok. This time nothing should go wrong.

512
00:43:32,893 --> 00:43:39,321
As you wish. l am doing it foryou,
as being yourfriend and lawyer.

513
00:43:39,533 --> 00:43:40,864
l was doing my duty.

514
00:43:41,402 --> 00:43:42,664
Now it is your wish.

515
00:43:50,544 --> 00:43:53,240
There is no loss, uncle? - No.

516
00:43:56,216 --> 00:43:58,684
So.. what do you say?

517
00:44:00,587 --> 00:44:02,020
As you wish.

518
00:44:04,291 --> 00:44:09,228
l was thinking, we wont find a
better suitorfor our Piya.

519
00:44:10,264 --> 00:44:13,028
So we should find a auspicious time..

520
00:44:13,233 --> 00:44:15,565
..and get both of them married.

521
00:44:17,071 --> 00:44:18,095
Even l was thinking the same.

522
00:44:19,139 --> 00:44:21,300
You look, how things work out.

523
00:44:27,715 --> 00:44:31,207
Take son. Bournvita foryou. - Thank you.

524
00:44:31,418 --> 00:44:33,215
So son, what have you thought?

525
00:44:33,420 --> 00:44:35,854
What will you do in life?

526
00:44:36,490 --> 00:44:39,220
Nothing uncle. l'm thinking
of going back home.

527
00:44:40,427 --> 00:44:42,054
But you know, l'm worried about Piya.
-You should be.

528
00:44:42,262 --> 00:44:43,661
l don't know what condition she might be in.

529
00:44:44,531 --> 00:44:48,228
Look son, whatever happens in life is for good.

530
00:44:48,902 --> 00:44:51,894
Had everything been alright in Piya's life..

531
00:44:52,106 --> 00:44:55,371
..then today you would be having
Bournvita with her husband.

532
00:44:55,576 --> 00:44:57,874
You wouldn't be having Bournvita
standing here with him and me.

533
00:44:58,078 --> 00:45:00,137
You wouldn't be having Bournvita.

534
00:45:00,347 --> 00:45:01,871
What? - He hasn't got it.

535
00:45:02,082 --> 00:45:03,014
He hasn't got it.

536
00:45:03,217 --> 00:45:07,381
Son, you are having Bournvita with us here..

537
00:45:07,588 --> 00:45:10,386
..because Piya has been separated
from her husband.

538
00:45:10,591 --> 00:45:12,149
He still hasn't got it.

539
00:45:12,393 --> 00:45:13,587
One second uncle.

540
00:45:13,961 --> 00:45:16,191
Are you telling me about
Piya or Bournvita?

541
00:45:16,397 --> 00:45:18,331
Hey shut up, shut up.

542
00:45:18,532 --> 00:45:19,658
You haven't got it, l'll explain to you.

543
00:45:19,867 --> 00:45:23,268
You.. l'll tell you.

544
00:45:23,470 --> 00:45:24,664
Piya has been divorced.

545
00:45:24,872 --> 00:45:25,839
Has been divorced. -Yeah.

546
00:45:26,373 --> 00:45:28,568
That means she doesn't stay
with her husband.

547
00:45:28,776 --> 00:45:30,471
That means she is alone once again.

548
00:45:30,677 --> 00:45:34,579
You have come here after 7 years,
crossing the seven seas, why?

549
00:45:35,516 --> 00:45:36,175
To have Bournvita.

550
00:45:36,383 --> 00:45:39,216
You haven't come for Bournvita!

551
00:45:39,420 --> 00:45:42,753
You have come because
you are destined to be with Piya..

552
00:45:42,956 --> 00:45:44,617
..and Piya is destined to be with you.

553
00:45:44,825 --> 00:45:47,385
You are made for each other.

554
00:45:47,594 --> 00:45:49,221
Made for each other. -Yeah.

555
00:45:49,997 --> 00:45:50,827
Really? -Yes.

556
00:45:51,031 --> 00:45:58,369
Yes. She is only yours, only yours.
- Only yours. - She's mine?

557
00:45:58,572 --> 00:45:59,869
Yeah, she's yours.

558
00:46:00,073 --> 00:46:02,303
Your name is written on her.

559
00:46:02,509 --> 00:46:03,407
Otherwise why would she have divorced?

560
00:46:03,610 --> 00:46:06,943
Why? -Why would you come here
after 7 years? -Why?

561
00:46:07,848 --> 00:46:08,872
Yeah man, that makes sense.

562
00:46:09,082 --> 00:46:10,549
Of course, that makes sense.

563
00:46:10,751 --> 00:46:12,514
Then why are you here having
Bournvita with us?

564
00:46:12,719 --> 00:46:17,554
Why? - Here is her address, that she had sent
forforwarding her letters etc.

565
00:46:17,758 --> 00:46:24,163
Take a flight to New York and after 22 hours,
Piya will be in your arms.

566
00:46:30,938 --> 00:46:32,337
One second. But..

What will l do there?

568
00:46:34,608 --> 00:46:35,734
Do we have to explain to you?

569
00:46:35,943 --> 00:46:37,376
Yes you will. -Will l?

570
00:46:37,578 --> 00:46:39,876
You wait.. l'll tell you.

You have opened my eyes,

00:52:44,644 --> 00:52:45,770
What is the need forthat?

642
00:52:45,979 --> 00:52:47,810
This is our duty.
-We are friends. - Friends.

643
00:52:48,248 --> 00:52:50,614
Uncle. Bon..

644
00:52:50,817 --> 00:52:52,876

You bloody Bon Voyage!

647
00:53:00,827 --> 00:53:02,294
Now there will be fun!

648
00:53:04,564 --> 00:53:06,964
No chance. No chance.

649
00:53:07,167 --> 00:53:07,792
Uncle.

650
00:53:08,201 --> 00:53:10,226
Do you think, this Champu will be
able to impress Piya.

651
00:53:10,437 --> 00:53:11,597
This Champu? Have you gone mad?

652
00:53:11,805 --> 00:53:13,432
You will have to do this.

653
00:53:13,874 --> 00:53:14,966
No problem.

654
00:53:15,342 --> 00:53:17,776
But uncle.
How will l go to New York?

655
00:53:21,014 --> 00:53:23,244
This is my lifelong saving.

656
00:53:23,817 --> 00:53:25,580
l had saved it for my wedding.

657
00:53:26,253 --> 00:53:27,379
Now it will be used foryour divorce.

658
00:53:27,587 --> 00:53:31,114
Take it son. - l have taken it uncle.

659
00:53:32,492 --> 00:53:35,188
l promise, that after my divorce..

660
00:53:35,395 --> 00:53:37,363
..l will get you married.

661
00:53:39,232 --> 00:53:41,632
He was on flight...

662
00:53:41,935 --> 00:53:47,771
l was down in a taxi. Proceeding to
New York in search of Piya.

663
00:53:47,974 --> 00:53:49,566
What will l do there?

664
00:53:49,776 --> 00:53:51,607
l didn't have any idea.

665
00:53:52,445 --> 00:53:55,243
Who else knows it betterthan me.

666
00:53:56,049 --> 00:53:57,914
Here's your boarding pass
and your passport.

667
00:53:58,618 --> 00:53:59,516
Thank you.

668
00:54:01,888 --> 00:54:04,049
Hi. Window or aisle?

669
00:54:04,257 --> 00:54:05,349
Anything will do, but Agastya Rao..

670
00:54:05,558 --> 00:54:06,525
..should be nearby.

671
00:54:13,199 --> 00:54:14,860
Hey Sohan.

672
00:54:16,770 --> 00:54:17,668
Agastya.

673
00:54:19,973 --> 00:54:22,407
Agastya Rao. Champu.

674
00:54:23,576 --> 00:54:24,873
''Piya knows the heart..''

675
00:54:25,078 --> 00:54:26,045
Yeah man.

676
00:54:28,982 --> 00:54:30,381
After all you have taken my advice.

677
00:54:31,184 --> 00:54:32,151
You are going to New York?

678
00:54:33,987 --> 00:54:34,954
Yeah. And what about you?

679
00:54:35,155 --> 00:54:36,087
Where are you off to?

680
00:54:37,090 --> 00:54:38,455
l am going to Ghatkopar.

681
00:54:38,892 --> 00:54:39,722
Ghatkopar?

682
00:54:39,926 --> 00:54:40,392
Where is that?

683
00:54:40,593 --> 00:54:41,890
l'll get down at the next stop.

684
00:54:42,495 --> 00:54:43,962
Hey stop man.

685
00:54:45,565 --> 00:54:46,293
Sure.

686
00:54:49,035 --> 00:54:52,402
Excuse me.
Can l have one hot chocolate please?

687
00:54:52,605 --> 00:54:53,572
l need to relax before take off.

688
00:54:53,773 --> 00:54:56,241
Sorry sir, there's no service before take off.

689
00:54:56,443 --> 00:54:57,410
You will have to wait. - Okay.

690
00:54:57,610 --> 00:54:59,544
Where's my belt?

691
00:54:59,746 --> 00:55:00,576
Here it is.

692
00:55:16,296 --> 00:55:19,163
May l have an apple juice.

693
00:55:19,366 --> 00:55:21,163
There's no service before take off sir.

694
00:55:21,368 --> 00:55:22,460
But l'll see what l can do.

695
00:55:22,669 --> 00:55:25,069
Oh and hot chocolate forthis young man here.

696
00:55:25,271 --> 00:55:26,397
Sure. - Thank you.

697
00:55:26,606 --> 00:55:27,903
He needs to relax before take off.

698
00:55:29,943 --> 00:55:31,103
Wow! How can you do it?

699
00:55:31,311 --> 00:55:32,903
How can you do all these things?

700
00:55:34,047 --> 00:55:35,378
Did you see that girl?

701
00:55:35,882 --> 00:55:39,113
Had l been like you,
l would have been with Piya.

702
00:55:39,319 --> 00:55:42,413
l don't even know how to talk to girls.

703
00:55:42,622 --> 00:55:43,850
Wish l was like you man.

704
00:55:45,425 --> 00:55:47,120
Me? ln charming girls?

705
00:55:47,327 --> 00:55:48,123
Yeah.

706
00:55:50,296 --> 00:55:52,662
lt's my luck, l was born with it.

707
00:55:52,866 --> 00:55:54,356
There's nothing one can't do.

708
00:55:55,035 --> 00:55:56,263
Cool. Cool.

709
00:55:56,469 --> 00:55:59,632
Hot chocolate sir. - Thank you.

710
00:55:59,839 --> 00:56:03,570
And your apple juice.
- Thank you sweetheart.

711
00:56:03,777 --> 00:56:04,971
And you know what?

712
00:56:05,178 --> 00:56:06,372
This is foryou.

713
00:56:09,682 --> 00:56:10,614
Thanks.

714
00:56:15,688 --> 00:56:17,315
l'm getting nervous thinking that when l..

715
00:56:17,524 --> 00:56:21,483
..meet Piya tomorrow,
what will become of me?

716
00:56:24,998 --> 00:56:28,934
l don't even know what
she likes or dislikes.

717
00:56:30,703 --> 00:56:32,568
l hope l don't make a fool out of myself.

718
00:56:32,772 --> 00:56:36,503
God has sent me to solve your problem.

719
00:56:36,876 --> 00:56:38,571
lf this is not a miracle then what is it?

720
00:56:39,145 --> 00:56:41,340
ln the same flight,
we are both going to New York.

721
00:56:41,548 --> 00:56:43,675
And that too, not alone,
but sitting together.

722
00:56:43,883 --> 00:56:44,577
Yeah.

723
00:56:44,784 --> 00:56:47,753
l promise you.

724
00:56:49,055 --> 00:56:49,714
l'll help you out.

725
00:56:49,923 --> 00:56:52,084
Specially after hearing your
about your pining for her.

726
00:56:52,592 --> 00:56:53,354
Really?

727
00:56:53,960 --> 00:56:56,485
l have promised uncle that, until l..

728
00:56:56,696 --> 00:57:03,693
..get you married,
l won't catch a flight back to Mumbai.

729
00:57:04,104 --> 00:57:07,699
Promise.- Our mission started like this.

730
00:57:07,907 --> 00:57:11,138
And then begun the biggest
con in the history.

731
00:57:57,123 --> 00:58:00,092
l completely surrendered myself to Suhan.

732
00:58:00,627 --> 00:58:02,322
He was my Godfather.

733
00:58:17,977 --> 00:58:21,105
Excuse me sir, can you
guide me to this address?

734
00:58:23,816 --> 00:58:25,613
The sweet little girl next door.

735
00:58:26,486 --> 00:58:27,111
Piya. -Yes.

736
00:58:27,320 --> 00:58:28,514
My neighbor.

737
00:58:30,390 --> 00:58:31,618
You've come to the right
address young man.

738
00:58:31,824 --> 00:58:32,950
She's right up there in
her apartment.

739
00:58:34,160 --> 00:58:35,127
But why is the window closed.

740
00:58:35,328 --> 00:58:37,125
She's probably sleeping right now.

741
00:58:38,998 --> 00:58:41,466
You must be the brother
she's been talking about.

742
00:58:42,001 --> 00:58:42,797
Her brother?

743
00:58:46,339 --> 00:58:47,135
Probably.

744
00:58:47,507 --> 00:58:49,634
Nice meeting you.

745
00:58:55,181 --> 00:58:55,977
Hey guys.

746
00:58:57,850 --> 00:59:10,490
''My love foryou is not new''

747
00:59:11,698 --> 00:59:16,158
''But still why...?''

748
00:59:22,875 --> 00:59:26,675
''l will make a house in front
of your house..''

749
00:59:26,879 --> 00:59:29,006
''l will make my world..''

750
00:59:30,883 --> 00:59:37,015
''ln my neighboring window,
there's a piece of moon..''

751
00:59:37,223 --> 00:59:41,353
''lt is regrettable that it is..''

752
00:59:42,562 --> 00:59:43,529
What are you looking at?

753
00:59:43,730 --> 00:59:44,856
You have forgotten the
mission so soon.

754
00:59:45,064 --> 00:59:48,363
Oh yes. Piya. Show me.

755
00:59:48,901 --> 00:59:50,528
She is probably sleeping. - Okay.

756
00:59:50,803 --> 00:59:53,704
You keep watching. Call me quickly
when she wakes up.

757
01:00:14,093 --> 01:00:14,559
What happened?

758
01:00:15,495 --> 01:00:16,223
What happened?

759
01:00:17,597 --> 01:00:18,723
You were right.

760
01:00:18,931 --> 01:00:20,728
She has grown so much in 7 years.

761
01:00:22,101 --> 01:00:23,227
Behave yourself. - Sorry.

762
01:00:23,436 --> 01:00:24,562
Relax. - Sorry. - Chill. - Sorry.

763
01:00:24,771 --> 01:00:25,738
Just hold. - Right.

764
01:00:29,442 --> 01:00:30,409
Have you gone crazy?

765
01:00:30,610 --> 01:00:32,077
She looks like Piya to you?

766
01:00:32,278 --> 01:00:32,903
Then who is she?

767
01:00:33,179 --> 01:00:36,910
Please. Get the number of your specs
checked Mr. Agastya Rao, okay?

768
01:00:37,116 --> 01:00:38,083
l am an lndian, not Russian.

769
01:00:38,284 --> 01:00:39,911
What?

770
01:00:40,119 --> 01:00:41,245
Agastya, Agastya.

771
01:00:43,289 --> 01:00:44,085
Agastya Rao.

772
01:00:45,124 --> 01:00:45,749
Sorry.

773
01:00:56,969 --> 01:00:58,436
Can l see once, once?

774
01:01:02,308 --> 01:01:03,275
Please.

775
01:01:30,503 --> 01:01:31,299
Agastya!

776
01:01:33,005 --> 01:01:33,972
What is this?

777
01:01:37,343 --> 01:01:38,310
What is this?

778
01:01:38,511 --> 01:01:41,480
l am an astronaut and this is a telescope.

779
01:01:41,681 --> 01:01:43,148
Father of binoculars.

780
01:01:43,583 --> 01:01:44,982
Move. Let me see.

781
01:01:45,184 --> 01:01:46,310
Why are you pushing me?

782
01:01:47,520 --> 01:01:48,316
Hold this.

783
01:01:49,689 --> 01:01:52,317
Amazing. - lsn't it?

784
01:01:52,792 --> 01:01:53,349
Something will have to be
done about you.

785
01:02:29,228 --> 01:02:32,857
Suhan understood l can't impress Piya.

786
01:02:33,566 --> 01:02:36,694
So he changed my
personality just like him.

787
01:03:13,105 --> 01:03:19,066
l am looking just like you, right?
Rock Star. -Yeah!

788
01:03:22,949 --> 01:03:24,746
Sir, what can l get foryou?

789
01:03:24,951 --> 01:03:27,419
An apple juice and wine.
- l'll have coffee.

790
01:03:29,121 --> 01:03:30,748
Uncle! - Uncle?

791
01:03:32,625 --> 01:03:33,421
How did you come here?

792
01:03:33,793 --> 01:03:35,420
Who uncle and whose uncle.

793
01:03:38,130 --> 01:03:40,928
Do you have a twin brother in lndia?
This small.

794
01:03:41,968 --> 01:03:44,937
lf l am this big then
how can my twin be this much?

795
01:03:45,137 --> 01:03:46,263
l don't have a twin brother.

796
01:03:46,472 --> 01:03:47,769
l'll ask my parents...

797
01:03:52,311 --> 01:03:55,610
Saw that. Absolutely identical.
He is uncle's carbon copy.

798
01:03:55,815 --> 01:03:58,443
How is it possible?
-Why it can't be possible?

799
01:03:58,651 --> 01:04:01,950
lt is written that there are
at least seven people in this..

800
01:04:02,154 --> 01:04:02,950
..with similarface.

801
01:04:04,156 --> 01:04:05,123
lt is all nonsense.

802
01:04:05,324 --> 01:04:07,952
No it is not nonsense.
lt is a scientifically proven thing.

803
01:04:08,327 --> 01:04:10,454
There are seven people
who look similar in this world.

804
01:04:10,730 --> 01:04:12,129
And... -And?

805
01:04:13,833 --> 01:04:18,463
Just a minute. That means that
there must be seven more..

806
01:04:18,671 --> 01:04:20,138
..girls looking just like Piya.

807
01:04:20,840 --> 01:04:24,139
l think l should be afterthem at least
l will get one of them. What say?

808
01:04:25,011 --> 01:04:26,979
Do you love Piya's face
or her personality?

809
01:04:27,179 --> 01:04:27,975
Both.

810
01:04:29,181 --> 01:04:31,479
Then you forget all this
nonsense and concentrate..

811
01:04:31,684 --> 01:04:33,811
..on the mission. - Ok. Tell me.

812
01:04:34,020 --> 01:04:36,488
Today is the mission's first day
so we will do warm up today.

813
01:04:36,689 --> 01:04:37,656
Listen, you do exactly
what l tell you to do.

814
01:04:37,857 --> 01:04:39,654
Not a penny less or
not a penny more.

815
01:04:39,859 --> 01:04:41,156
Otherwise the whole
mission will get ruined.

816
01:04:41,527 --> 01:04:43,154
When Piya comes out of
her apartment..

817
01:04:45,364 --> 01:04:46,831
..when you look at..

818
01:04:47,033 --> 01:04:48,830
.. heryou react as if you have
seen her suddenly. - How?

819
01:04:50,570 --> 01:04:52,003
Just show me once more.

820
01:04:53,039 --> 01:04:55,667
Now l'll do it. Just look at me. - Ok.

821
01:04:57,777 --> 01:05:00,337
You do wonderful false acting.
You should have been in Hollywood.

822
01:05:00,546 --> 01:05:01,342
Now stop it.

823
01:05:01,547 --> 01:05:03,845
Now listen further.
When she is walking ahead you'll..

824
01:05:04,116 --> 01:05:07,517
..call her by her name.
Like this...Piya!

825
01:05:07,720 --> 01:05:08,846
Piya! - Oh! My God!

826
01:05:09,055 --> 01:05:10,522
Oh! My God! -You here?

827
01:05:10,723 --> 01:05:12,190
You here? - How amazing!
- How amazing!

828
01:05:12,391 --> 01:05:13,187
She will turn back and look at you.

829
01:05:13,459 --> 01:05:14,858
Her air will fly in high speed.

830
01:05:23,235 --> 01:05:25,203
Go my lion. My blessings
are with you.

831
01:05:25,404 --> 01:05:26,530
You remember everything, right? - No.

832
01:05:27,239 --> 01:05:29,867
What? - l forget everything
when l look at Piya.

833
01:05:30,076 --> 01:05:31,202
You please come with me.

834
01:05:31,410 --> 01:05:33,037
No! -Why?

835
01:05:33,412 --> 01:05:37,041
Why? Why...Why? - No, why
...why am l asking this..

836
01:05:37,249 --> 01:05:38,876
..question? l am asking you this.
Why? - Ok.

837
01:05:39,752 --> 01:05:40,878
Come on, let us go back home. Please.

838
01:05:41,087 --> 01:05:43,214
No. l'll do one thing.

839
01:05:43,422 --> 01:05:46,391
l will go with you, l will be nearyou
but l will not be with you. Ok?

840
01:05:46,592 --> 01:05:51,052
Ok. -Wait. You'll go like this to her.

841
01:05:53,933 --> 01:05:54,558
Now it is Ok. - Thank you, brother.

842
01:05:55,968 --> 01:06:02,066
Let's rock it now. - Rock it.
Rock it in and out..

843
01:06:02,441 --> 01:06:03,066
Ok. Let's go.

844
01:06:20,626 --> 01:06:22,253
Understood Champu, what you've to do?

845
01:06:28,134 --> 01:06:31,934
Hello! Yes, everything is fine...Oh! Piya!

846
01:06:33,305 --> 01:06:34,431
Go back. Start again.

847
01:06:34,640 --> 01:06:37,268
Energy...loud...feeling...emotion...

848
01:06:37,977 --> 01:06:39,945
Take 2. Ready? Action!

849
01:06:40,479 --> 01:06:46,782
Hello! No, no, there is absolutely
...Oh! Piya?

850
01:06:47,820 --> 01:06:49,947
Cut! Cut! Cut! What are you doing?

851
01:06:50,222 --> 01:06:53,623
Go back. Call out louder, Piya.

852
01:06:53,993 --> 01:06:55,620
Take 3. Action!

853
01:06:55,895 --> 01:06:58,955
Yes, everything l fine...Piya!

854
01:07:53,385 --> 01:07:56,013
Me...me...

855
01:08:06,398 --> 01:08:07,865
Oh! My God! Champu?!

856
01:08:19,311 --> 01:08:20,539
You have changed so much, Champu?

857
01:08:21,413 --> 01:08:27,545
Yes. -When did you come to New York?

858
01:08:29,255 --> 01:08:31,883
This morning....Today morning.

859
01:08:54,446 --> 01:08:55,743
Nice meeting you.

860
01:08:55,948 --> 01:08:57,575
Hi! Piya! - Hi!

861
01:08:59,285 --> 01:09:00,912
Zubin. Zubin Batlibhoy.

862
01:09:01,287 --> 01:09:07,089
Hi! Bye! Bye! Piya! Piya Bye! Bye!

863
01:09:07,293 --> 01:09:09,090
Where are you Piya? Bye!

864
01:09:14,633 --> 01:09:16,931
Did you see that how
Piya just went with Zubin?

865
01:09:17,136 --> 01:09:18,103
l saw. l saw everything.

866
01:09:18,804 --> 01:09:21,773
Don't worry, she'll not for him.

867
01:09:21,974 --> 01:09:23,498
But what happened to you?

868
01:09:23,709 --> 01:09:24,971
Had you applied henna on your lips?

869
01:09:27,479 --> 01:09:29,777
l had told you earlierthat
the moment l see Piya something..

870
01:09:29,982 --> 01:09:30,778
..happens to me.

871
01:09:31,050 --> 01:09:32,779
l think l have laid a bet
on a lame horse.

872
01:09:32,985 --> 01:09:36,443
l have a bright idea. Sorry,
l was hearing you both.

873
01:09:36,655 --> 01:09:37,622
l could not stop myself.

874
01:09:38,490 --> 01:09:41,618
This is a micro walkie-talkie.

875
01:09:41,827 --> 01:09:45,957
With this l sit here and control
my entire staff.

876
01:09:48,000 --> 01:09:49,627
You are too much, uncle.

877
01:09:49,835 --> 01:09:53,464
When you want to stop
showing off then tell us.

878
01:09:53,672 --> 01:09:55,139
We want to take something important.

879
01:09:55,341 --> 01:09:56,638
Alright. l was just trying to help you.

880
01:09:56,842 --> 01:09:57,467
Please, don't pay attention to him.

881
01:09:57,676 --> 01:09:58,802
You tell me what you wanted to say.

882
01:09:59,178 --> 01:10:00,304
Oh! You are a good boy.

883
01:10:00,512 --> 01:10:03,811
You know you put this one
behind your ear and the..

884
01:10:04,016 --> 01:10:06,644
..other one you put it behind your ear.

885
01:10:06,852 --> 01:10:10,310
And then what everyou want
him to do you tell him.

886
01:10:10,522 --> 01:10:12,649
You will keep telling him and
he will keep doing them.

887
01:10:13,359 --> 01:10:16,487
Wow! Uncle. At least
you were of some use.

888
01:10:16,695 --> 01:10:17,491
Come on, now your work
will be done.

889
01:10:18,097 --> 01:10:18,995
Thank you, very much.

890
01:10:19,365 --> 01:10:22,823
But listen, remember its range
is only 100 metres.

891
01:10:24,370 --> 01:10:25,837
Come on Punk, let's rock.

892
01:10:27,039 --> 01:10:28,836
Come on, come on. Just say
it once more. Once more.

893
01:10:29,041 --> 01:10:30,338
Come on Punk, let's rock.

894
01:10:30,542 --> 01:10:31,839
You are bloody clear man.

895
01:10:34,380 --> 01:10:36,348
Come on, punk let's rock.

896
01:10:45,124 --> 01:10:46,853
Come on, give me your credit card.

897
01:10:47,226 --> 01:10:49,854
Why? -Why?

898
01:10:50,129 --> 01:10:52,359
Why am l asking this question?

899
01:10:52,564 --> 01:10:53,360
l am just thinking this.

900
01:10:53,565 --> 01:10:56,363
After all you are going for
my work, brother. - Right.

901
01:10:57,569 --> 01:10:58,866
You are going for my work.

902
01:10:59,138 --> 01:11:01,368
Not this one...give me this one.

903
01:11:02,074 --> 01:11:03,701
Aftertoday this credit card
will remain with me and..

904
01:11:03,909 --> 01:11:06,377
..you will keep sitting in the car.

905
01:11:18,924 --> 01:11:22,382
lt is Ok. He has taken my credit card.

906
01:11:24,930 --> 01:11:25,897
Who the hell are you?

907
01:11:26,098 --> 01:11:27,725
You did not recognise me? - No.

908
01:11:28,600 --> 01:11:30,067
Have a look.

909
01:11:31,971 --> 01:11:33,734
That means that nobody will be
able to recognise me.

910
01:11:34,106 --> 01:11:37,234
And l will be at a distance of
100 metres from you.

911
01:11:37,443 --> 01:11:39,070
This is a book on Picasso.
- But this is an old book.

912
01:11:39,278 --> 01:11:41,906
Second hand, only then it will
appear like you've read it.

913
01:12:04,636 --> 01:12:05,933
Excuse me, Can l help you?

914
01:12:06,638 --> 01:12:10,438
Oh! Champu, it's you? l am sorry l...

915
01:12:10,642 --> 01:12:12,269
No. From your mouth even
Champu sounds sexy.

916
01:12:15,647 --> 01:12:17,444
But how come you are here?

917
01:12:19,651 --> 01:12:22,620
l was passing by and l saw that
it was an lnteriors shop...

918
01:12:23,155 --> 01:12:24,622
You work here.

No. This is my store.

920
01:12:28,327 --> 01:12:29,624
You own this store? -Yes.

01:12:29,828 --> 01:12:32,126
These are your designs. -Yes.

922
01:12:34,166 --> 01:12:37,135
You know these flowers.
Halcyon? Wonderful! Fabulous!

923
01:12:37,669 --> 01:12:38,795
Do you like flowers?

924
01:12:39,038 --> 01:12:39,970
Oh! What?

925
01:12:40,239 --> 01:12:41,467

927
01:12:43,909 --> 01:12:46,639
Flowers are in my blood.
- Flowers are in my blood.

928
01:12:47,179 --> 01:12:48,976
When you see me...

929
01:12:49,348 --> 01:12:51,145
You feel l don't go well with flowers.

930
01:12:51,350 --> 01:12:53,818
Never judge anyone with appearance.

931
01:12:54,019 --> 01:12:56,317
You are the flower Halycon.

932
01:12:56,522 --> 01:13:01,482
lt's found in tropical forest of South America.

933
01:13:01,693 --> 01:13:02,489
Very good. Shake hands now.

934
01:13:02,694 --> 01:13:03,820
Of course.

935
01:13:08,367 --> 01:13:11,165

936
01:13:11,370 --> 01:13:13,338
..interested in flowers.

937
01:13:13,539 --> 01:13:16,007
Listen l do not believe in this
boy-girl thing.

938
01:13:16,375 --> 01:13:18,172
l do not believe in boy-girl thing.

939
01:13:18,377 --> 01:13:19,503
l am a homosexual.

940
01:13:19,711 --> 01:13:20,837
l am a homosexual.

941
01:13:21,046 --> 01:13:23,844
Oh Shit! Don't say that.

942
01:13:24,550 --> 01:13:26,518
You say, l am a heterosexual.

943
01:13:26,718 --> 01:13:28,515
Heterosexual.

944
01:13:30,722 --> 01:13:32,189
Oops! - Oops!

945
01:13:34,726 --> 01:13:36,193
You like Picasso?

946
01:13:36,728 --> 01:13:40,687
l like Picasso? l love Picasso.
Picasso is in my blood.

947
01:13:41,233 --> 01:13:42,700
But how did you know? Oh!

948
01:13:46,238 --> 01:13:47,705
Sharp observation.

949
01:13:49,908 --> 01:13:52,706
l have read Picasso fourtimes.

950
01:13:53,912 --> 01:13:57,040
You know what is the best thing
about Picasso? -What?

951
01:13:57,916 --> 01:13:58,541
Boss!

952
01:14:04,590 --> 01:14:06,717
So, you were telling me
something about Picasso.

953
01:14:07,593 --> 01:14:11,893
Oh! Yes, Picasso. Picasso....

954
01:14:13,332 --> 01:14:15,061
Who are you? -Zorro.

955
01:14:15,267 --> 01:14:17,565
Zorro? Then become invisible
and show me.

956
01:14:21,607 --> 01:14:23,734
You really want to know
about Picasso?

957
01:14:24,009 --> 01:14:26,910
You are a fraud. Fraud!
You do this and show me.

958
01:14:34,686 --> 01:14:36,085
How could you that Zubin?

959
01:14:36,288 --> 01:14:37,414
No, l didn't do anything.

960
01:14:37,689 --> 01:14:41,921
Zorro, it was him outside your boutique.
You guys can't believe it.

961
01:14:50,302 --> 01:14:52,770
l am too glad that you've
come to our Casino.

962
01:14:53,138 --> 01:14:56,596
l had done all the arrangements
forthe Fresh food.

963
01:14:56,808 --> 01:14:58,275
But suddenly how come

964
01:14:58,477 --> 01:14:59,273
..ltalian food.

01:14:59,478 --> 01:15:00,775

967
01:15:06,318 --> 01:15:10,277
Suhan never got an opportunity
to wear diffrent get ups.

968
01:15:10,489 --> 01:15:14,448
So he used this opportunity to
wear different costumes.

969
01:15:14,660 --> 01:15:17,356
Always came in a different costume.
And he was funny.

970
01:15:23,335 --> 01:15:24,802

01:15:29,675 --> 01:15:33,304
Just diet coke. Come on, Zubin.

No. l hate ltalian food.

975
01:15:35,847 --> 01:15:37,144
Specially spicy food.

976
01:15:37,516 --> 01:15:38,813
You don't like spicy food?

977
01:15:39,017 --> 01:15:40,484
You don't like spicy food? - No.

978
01:15:40,686 --> 01:15:41,482
You like spicy food.

979

l like spicy food. l love spicy food.
Spice is in my blood.

980
01:15:46,858 --> 01:15:47,825
Spice is in my blood.

981
01:16:07,546 --> 01:16:08,843

982
01:16:09,715 --> 01:16:12,843

985
01:16:32,571 --> 01:16:34,698
Hey! Where is this man?
Where is this man?

986
01:17:25,457 --> 01:17:27,425
You? You were at the boutique
too, right?

987
01:17:27,793 --> 01:17:30,421
Now l know. You are following us.

988
01:17:43,308 --> 01:17:44,104
Come on, let us go.

989
01:17:58,156 --> 01:18:00,124
What are you looking for Aditya?

990
01:18:00,992 --> 01:18:03,119
What was l looking for?

991
01:18:05,831 --> 01:18:09,790
Brooklyn Tower! l wanted to see
it since my childhood.

992
01:18:10,335 --> 01:18:11,802
lt's very beautiful, isn't it?

993
01:18:14,840 --> 01:18:15,966
Thanks for everything.

994
01:18:16,174 --> 01:18:18,642
You should not thank me.
You should thank Zubin.

995
01:18:18,844 --> 01:18:19,469
He paid the bill.

996
01:18:20,679 --> 01:18:22,442
No, l did not mean that.

997
01:18:23,014 --> 01:18:24,811
l really had a great time this evening.

998
01:18:26,184 --> 01:18:34,319
Me too. ln fact after 7 years
l have laughed so much.

999
01:18:36,862 --> 01:18:40,992
7 years? Can l ask you
something? Hope you will..

1000
01:18:41,199 --> 01:18:42,166
..not feel bad.

1001
01:18:42,534 --> 01:18:45,002
Did you love a girl in the college?

1002
01:18:48,874 --> 01:18:52,002
l heard that she broke your heart
so you left college and..

1003
01:18:52,210 --> 01:18:54,007
..went away.

1004
01:18:58,717 --> 01:19:01,015
We did not come to know
where you had gone.

1005
01:19:01,720 --> 01:19:05,850
You just disappeared. You used
to love that girl very..

1006
01:19:06,057 --> 01:19:13,020
..much, right? Do you
love her now also?

1007
01:19:16,902 --> 01:19:20,702
l am sorry...l think you
are unable to forget her.

1008
01:19:23,909 --> 01:19:27,709
You don't mind me asking...
Who she was.

1009
01:19:29,247 --> 01:19:33,206
Look if only you want it.
l might be of some help to you.

1010
01:19:33,418 --> 01:19:36,216
Please tell me who was she.

1011
01:19:36,421 --> 01:19:38,889
You.

1012
01:19:46,264 --> 01:19:48,391
How can you help me?

1013
01:19:54,940 --> 01:19:58,068
Ok. Now she is already married.

1014
01:20:00,278 --> 01:20:03,736
Then you can get any good girl.

1015
01:20:04,015 --> 01:20:04,913
You forget her.

1016
01:20:05,116 --> 01:20:09,075
No. l will marry her only.

1017
01:20:09,287 --> 01:20:13,087
lf l get married then l will marry
her only otherwise...

1018
01:20:17,295 --> 01:20:22,426
lf Suhan hadn't come, the show
would've ended before the start.

1019
01:20:54,332 --> 01:20:56,129
ln thirty seconds she will
come out wearing a nightie.

1020
01:21:02,741 --> 01:21:04,971
Oh! But where have l kept the remote?

1021
01:21:11,349 --> 01:21:12,475
Oh! Yes, in the kitchen.

1022
01:21:17,022 --> 01:21:22,654
She will jump on the couch.
Now she will watch..

1023
01:21:22,861 --> 01:21:24,158
..emotional films and cry
like Meena Kumari.

1024
01:21:31,870 --> 01:21:32,461
What are you doing?

1025
01:21:33,004 --> 01:21:34,995
l am eating chocolate and
studying the case.

1026
01:21:36,541 --> 01:21:37,838
That's enough. Excuse me.

1027
01:21:38,043 --> 01:21:40,170
What is it? Are you a wrestler?

1028
01:21:40,378 --> 01:21:41,504
What will you do by watching?

1029
01:21:41,947 --> 01:21:45,348
l don't think you should watch
like this. -Why?

1030
01:21:45,550 --> 01:21:47,347
Then you too will fall in love.

1031
01:21:48,219 --> 01:21:55,022
What? l don't need anybody's love.

1032
01:21:55,226 --> 01:21:58,024
l am happy alone. You keep
your Piya to yourself.

1033
01:22:00,398 --> 01:22:02,025
Now what have you done?

1034
01:22:17,816 --> 01:22:18,714
Satellite connection?

1035
01:22:18,917 --> 01:22:21,715
No. Telescope. - Oh! Fantastic.

1036
01:22:24,923 --> 01:22:28,051
Yeah. Pop corn? -Yeah.

1037
01:23:33,491 --> 01:23:42,627
''lt is an unknown city.''

1038
01:23:43,001 --> 01:23:51,966
''lt is an unknown evening.''

1039
01:23:52,510 --> 01:23:59,473
''Life is...

1040
01:23:59,684 --> 01:24:06,487
..unknown.''

1041
01:24:06,691 --> 01:24:16,327
''What is your name?''

1042
01:24:16,534 --> 01:24:18,661
''Strange is this life.''

1043
01:24:18,870 --> 01:24:21,168
''This life is strange.''

1044
01:24:21,372 --> 01:24:23,340
''Here you meet then separate.''

1045
01:24:23,608 --> 01:24:25,667
''After separation again we meet.''

1046
01:24:32,383 --> 01:24:41,348
''lt is an unknown city.''
