1
00:03:31,711 --> 00:03:39,015
"Badi Ma, Dwijdas, Kumud, Padma,
Dharamdas, where's everybody?"

2
00:03:39,519 --> 00:03:45,287
"Look, here's Devdas' letter.
Devdas is returning from London"

3
00:03:45,725 --> 00:03:48,125
Really? Happy tidings!

4
00:03:48,461 --> 00:03:53,057
Dwijdas! You hear? Devdas is coming!
- I don't think so. Ma is lying

5
00:03:53,433 --> 00:03:56,334
"You're lying, Ma.
- Here's the letter"

6
00:03:56,669 --> 00:03:58,967
show me the letter

7
00:04:00,673 --> 00:04:04,473
shubhankar! My Devdas is coming!
- Really?

8
00:04:04,811 --> 00:04:06,972
Give your brother the good news

9
00:04:07,380 --> 00:04:10,679
Badi Ma... Badi Ma...
my Tempest is coming home

10
00:04:13,453 --> 00:04:14,442
Thank God

11
00:04:14,787 --> 00:04:20,020
"Compliments, lady!
- Not in tears Dharamdas"

12
00:04:20,393 --> 00:04:23,362
I want a promise. I am going...
to receive Devdas. I alone.

13
00:04:23,696 --> 00:04:30,499
"Yes, but wind the clocks once again
After so many years! My son is back"

14
00:04:30,837 --> 00:04:36,275
"Winding clocks won't make time move,
nor any faster brings the son home"

15
00:04:36,709 --> 00:04:40,509
I know Kumud! But look
how my heart throbs

16
00:04:40,847 --> 00:04:43,714
Oh when will the day give way
to the night...?

17
00:04:44,450 --> 00:04:48,477
Drum up the cheer!
Let the music play

18
00:04:51,724 --> 00:04:56,286
What joyous tempest stirs my
heartstrings! Drum up the cheer

19
00:04:56,663 --> 00:05:01,623
Let the music play!
- Welcome the onset of Tempest

20
00:05:10,143 --> 00:05:14,341
"All day I'm hollering at everyone
to get ready, and no one listens?"

21
00:05:14,681 --> 00:05:18,640
The house has been spruced up.
- Devdas' room is ready

22
00:05:19,052 --> 00:05:26,686
Dharamdas has tethered the horses.
- Badi Ma decided who wears what

23
00:05:27,427 --> 00:05:28,451
Happy...?

24
00:05:29,462 --> 00:05:33,694
"Once you get your baby, you'll know
what joy is in seeing him come home"

25
00:05:34,400 --> 00:05:37,369
Kaushalya Didi (Didi: Sister)
- Goodness! Here comes the actress

26
00:05:37,704 --> 00:05:40,673
"In she traipses and,
Ei Kaushalya Didi..."

27
00:05:41,040 --> 00:05:43,008
"sweet shondesh" for you" "

28
00:05:44,911 --> 00:05:50,042
"Ei Kaushalya Didi, look
shondesh for you"

29
00:05:50,416 --> 00:05:54,352
sumitra! Lovely timing!
- Sumitra-Kaki's timing!

30
00:05:54,721 --> 00:05:59,158
"Always opportune.
And your "shondesh" is famous!"

31
00:05:59,492 --> 00:06:02,461
Hear that Didi?
- Let her talk. Guess who's coming?

32
00:06:02,795 --> 00:06:05,423
I know! Mr Chattopadhyay...?

33
00:06:07,467 --> 00:06:12,666
"Silly! You won't believe this!
My Tempest, my Devdas is coming!"

34
00:06:13,005 --> 00:06:15,200
"Really Didi...?
- Yes, yes, really!"

35
00:06:15,541 --> 00:06:17,133
Thank Goddess Durga

36
00:06:17,477 --> 00:06:22,744
"My compliments, Didi!
- I'm seeing my son after 10 years"

37
00:06:23,549 --> 00:06:28,282
What might he look like? What might
he sound like? What will he tell me?

38
00:06:29,155 --> 00:06:32,056
"How am I going to survive
tonight, sumitra?"

39
00:06:32,759 --> 00:06:39,130
How I wish I wouldn't blink!
What if he walks in right then?

40
00:06:39,532 --> 00:06:45,334
"I only remember Devdas, the boy
who'd walk up to my house..."

41
00:06:45,772 --> 00:06:50,766
"peep around the door to ask me...
- Kaki-Ma, is Paro in?"

42
00:06:52,578 --> 00:06:55,172
"There she goes, into the act"

43
00:06:56,249 --> 00:07:00,515
"And when Dev stormed out,
I'd send Paro to find him"

44
00:07:00,853 --> 00:07:04,380
Found him always in guava orchards.
- And Dharamdas would haul him in...

45
00:07:04,724 --> 00:07:10,390
by his ear! Some friendship!
- And when Devdas was leaving...

46
00:07:10,730 --> 00:07:16,066
"going abroad for his studies,
how my Paro ran after his buggy..."

47
00:07:16,402 --> 00:07:18,870
as if possessed. Arre O'Deva

48
00:07:19,238 --> 00:07:21,206
Arre O'Deva

49
00:07:21,541 --> 00:07:25,409
"In that scorching sun, her feet
blistering on the gravelly soil..."

50
00:07:25,745 --> 00:07:32,048
"yet she ran on, screaming,
I'm going with Dev"

51
00:07:32,752 --> 00:07:37,451
I'm going abroad too!
- Are you out of your mind?

52
00:07:40,193 --> 00:07:44,562
Send her abroad? My silly girl

53
00:07:48,434 --> 00:07:50,459
she owed Dev three Rupees

54
00:07:50,770 --> 00:07:55,707
Let me go. I got to give him
his 3 Rupees

55
00:07:58,478 --> 00:08:02,141
A lamp lit for a loved one
draws the wayfarer home

56
00:08:02,482 --> 00:08:06,077
"For 10 years, in that belief
she kept that lamp alight for Dev"

57
00:08:06,419 --> 00:08:12,881
"Not once she let the lamp go out!
I must tell her, she'll be glad"

58
00:08:15,528 --> 00:08:18,053
"she will be overjoyed.
- Yes sumitra, go"

59
00:08:21,734 --> 00:08:25,397
It's your son who's coming home
and she is the happier for it

60
00:08:25,738 --> 00:08:29,071
Why not? She's our neighbour.
Paro and Devdas...

61
00:08:29,408 --> 00:08:32,400
were childhood friends.
- What's left of that childhood?

62
00:08:32,745 --> 00:08:36,738
"Both are grown ups now...
Kaki-Ma's "shondesh"?"

63
00:08:53,699 --> 00:08:57,499
"What's up Kaki-Ma?
- Manorama, where is Paro?"

64
00:08:57,870 --> 00:09:01,362
"Where else? Must be in her room,
talking to her lamp"

65
00:09:01,707 --> 00:09:04,301
Not lamp!
- Devdas

66
00:09:04,710 --> 00:09:07,406
Oh God.
- What's the matter?

67
00:09:07,847 --> 00:09:12,045
The news I have for her
will drive her mad with joy

68
00:09:12,418 --> 00:09:14,409
What news?

69
00:09:15,221 --> 00:09:17,382
"Paro, Devdas is coming"

70
00:09:17,823 --> 00:09:21,384
"Really?
- Yes, Devdas is coming"

71
00:09:21,727 --> 00:09:26,391
They're preparing for a welcome!
Kaushalya-Didi is nearly going mad

72
00:09:26,732 --> 00:09:29,223
The whole house is
in raptures...

73
00:09:30,536 --> 00:09:32,527
"silly, are you crying?"

74
00:09:32,838 --> 00:09:36,069
Let not tears of joy
douse the lamp before Dev arrives

75
00:09:36,409 --> 00:09:40,869
No power on Earth can put out
this lamp

76
00:09:41,547 --> 00:09:45,950
shall we put the mighty lamp
to test?

77
00:10:18,384 --> 00:10:21,217
At season's change...

78
00:10:21,721 --> 00:10:24,417
comes...

79
00:10:25,291 --> 00:10:28,124
cloudwaves

80
00:10:32,098 --> 00:10:32,393
A waft...

81
00:10:33,733 --> 00:10:35,394
will come...

82
00:10:35,735 --> 00:10:38,135
to blow out this lamp

83
00:10:42,541 --> 00:10:48,741
This longing I didn't let die

84
00:10:59,692 --> 00:11:05,688
This longing I never let die

85
00:11:06,565 --> 00:11:10,695
"This lamp, my love..."

86
00:11:12,705 --> 00:11:19,235
"will never be extinguished,
this flame of my love"

87
00:11:19,879 --> 00:11:24,714
"My love, come to me my love"

88
00:11:26,619 --> 00:11:31,716
Now come to me

89
00:11:34,493 --> 00:11:37,394
As this lamp burns...

90
00:11:37,730 --> 00:11:42,030
"I'm burning in my every pore
and my heart"

91
00:11:42,535 --> 00:11:45,732
Now come to me

92
00:11:47,440 --> 00:11:52,742
"Come to me, my love"

93
00:12:39,925 --> 00:12:42,519
Distance parted us...

94
00:12:43,729 --> 00:12:46,789
there was the pain of parting

95
00:12:47,133 --> 00:12:50,296
My eyes yearned...

96
00:12:50,736 --> 00:12:55,196
but there you were...

97
00:12:55,674 --> 00:12:59,075
"glittering, glowing..."

98
00:12:59,411 --> 00:13:01,276
awash in joys...

99
00:13:02,548 --> 00:13:05,415
while here...

100
00:13:05,785 --> 00:13:08,686
"'I burned..."

101
00:13:09,488 --> 00:13:14,357
"while here, I burned"

102
00:13:18,097 --> 00:13:21,157
"Once again, clouds thunder..."

103
00:13:21,500 --> 00:13:24,697
raining in thunderous rhapsody

104
00:13:25,037 --> 00:13:27,505
Tempest strikes again...

105
00:13:27,873 --> 00:13:31,707
but my lamp is never doused...

106
00:13:32,244 --> 00:13:34,371
"my love, my flame..."

107
00:13:34,713 --> 00:13:40,618
"no matter how much the rains,
tempest and thunder torment you"

108
00:13:42,855 --> 00:13:48,487
"Come now, come to me, my love"

109
00:13:49,829 --> 00:13:54,357
"Come, my love"

110
00:14:01,473 --> 00:14:04,169
she's craZy

111
00:14:04,677 --> 00:14:07,669
she's naive

112
00:14:08,414 --> 00:14:14,216
"Oh yes, with a gust of wind
will come the one you seek"

113
00:14:14,687 --> 00:14:16,018
My love...

114
00:14:16,422 --> 00:14:19,687
come to me my love

115
00:14:21,894 --> 00:14:27,958
"The passion,
she will never let die"

116
00:14:28,400 --> 00:14:33,702
"My love, this lamp is you"

117
00:15:05,537 --> 00:15:09,337
"Hurry! The buggy is here!
Kaushalya, quick"

118
00:15:09,675 --> 00:15:13,008
Devdas is here!
- Coming

119
00:15:13,345 --> 00:15:17,179
I was lighting the welcome-lamp.
Tell Badi-Ma

120
00:15:17,850 --> 00:15:21,251
"If you take so much time,
Devdas will give himself a welcome"

121
00:15:21,620 --> 00:15:24,487
"Give himself a welcome?
Today, I'm welcoming him"

122
00:15:24,823 --> 00:15:30,955
Wait a minute! I get to see Devdas
first. Everyone shut your eyes

123
00:15:32,364 --> 00:15:34,696
For my sake.
- All right?

124
00:15:35,401 --> 00:15:40,361
Lady! I don't believe! Could the
world change so much in ten years?

125
00:15:40,706 --> 00:15:46,372
"Deva is as tall as my shoulders,
my very shoulders he sat upon"

126
00:15:46,712 --> 00:15:51,081
see him and you'll forget to blink!
- Don't torment me! Where's my Dev?

127
00:15:51,417 --> 00:15:54,716
"Got off on the way. Said, he will
be back after seeing "My Paro"

128
00:15:56,522 --> 00:15:59,958
should be here any moment

129
00:16:00,392 --> 00:16:03,884
"Chhoto-Ma, you wanted to be the first
to set your eyes on Devdas?"

130
00:16:04,863 --> 00:16:06,854
Will it be Paro's eyes now?

131
00:16:10,669 --> 00:16:12,660
"Chhoto-Ma, what to do with this?"

132
00:16:26,485 --> 00:16:27,747
Paro

133
00:16:28,454 --> 00:16:30,422
I think it's Devdas

134
00:16:40,899 --> 00:16:42,161
Devdas...

135
00:16:42,768 --> 00:16:46,761
"how have you been? Fine?
Come in son, welcome"

136
00:16:47,773 --> 00:16:49,570
"Bless you, son"

137
00:16:49,908 --> 00:16:55,073
You look just like an Englishman!
We've been so eager to see you

138
00:16:55,414 --> 00:16:58,815
Kaushalya-Didi is dying to see you.
- Where is Paro?

139
00:16:59,485 --> 00:17:02,420
She was here a moment ago

140
00:17:03,455 --> 00:17:06,185
"she said, let Devdas come
and I'll do this and I'll do that"

141
00:17:06,525 --> 00:17:11,326
I'll fight with him and scratch him.
Now you're here and she's hiding

142
00:17:11,663 --> 00:17:12,391
Ei Paro

143
00:17:12,731 --> 00:17:16,098
"Can I go upstairs?
- Yes son, go on"

144
00:18:35,914 --> 00:18:37,905
How have you been Paro?

145
00:18:42,588 --> 00:18:46,285
Won't you turn to see my face?
We're meeting after so many days

146
00:18:46,658 --> 00:18:50,253
"Days? For you, maybe.
For me..."

147
00:18:50,596 --> 00:18:54,532
"10 years, 6 months,
4 days and 6 hours"

148
00:18:55,868 --> 00:18:58,496
You never missed me?
- I did

149
00:18:58,904 --> 00:19:03,705
Lies! Only 5 letters in 10 years?
There are four seasons in a year

150
00:19:04,743 --> 00:19:11,273
Couldn't you write once a season?
- Makes sense. You're a big girl

151
00:19:12,451 --> 00:19:13,713
Takes time?

152
00:19:14,086 --> 00:19:16,418
The desire to meet the sea
turns the stream into a river

153
00:19:16,755 --> 00:19:19,246
Then why take time
to show your face?

154
00:19:19,625 --> 00:19:24,722
"Like sighting the Moon after ages,
I fear I'll leave you breathless"

155
00:19:27,366 --> 00:19:32,770
Not even the Moon is as vain.
- But the Moon is scarred

156
00:19:33,839 --> 00:19:39,243
"Till moonrise spare the Moon,
to see which leaves me breathless..."

157
00:19:39,678 --> 00:19:42,738
the Moon's radiance?
Or your vanity?

158
00:19:48,787 --> 00:19:53,224
"Paro, I hate the thought
of someone else touching you"

159
00:20:03,735 --> 00:20:06,363
"Look, Devdas is here!
- Let him come"

160
00:20:06,738 --> 00:20:08,706
Don't be cross.
- I don't want to talk to him

161
00:20:09,074 --> 00:20:11,167
Tell him to go away.
- But Ma...

162
00:20:11,543 --> 00:20:13,511
"I said, I don't want to...
- Ma"

163
00:20:19,751 --> 00:20:22,083
"Go, I don't want to see your face"

164
00:20:22,754 --> 00:20:25,723
"Why, what's so ugly
about my face..."

165
00:20:26,458 --> 00:20:29,427
that neither Paro
nor you want to see?

166
00:20:29,761 --> 00:20:33,390
"After 10 years of waiting,
the neighbour gets to welcome you?"

167
00:20:33,765 --> 00:20:35,733
Go back to your Paro

168
00:20:37,769 --> 00:20:41,296
Won't you open your eyes?
- I won't

169
00:20:43,642 --> 00:20:46,440
Won't see me either?

170
00:20:49,348 --> 00:20:54,376
"Very well, I'm going away.
- Where...?"

171
00:20:54,820 --> 00:20:56,788
"Where are you going, Dev?
- Dev, stop"

172
00:20:57,889 --> 00:21:00,722
Why did you let him leave?
I was just joking

173
00:21:01,727 --> 00:21:03,524
I was joking too

174
00:21:15,641 --> 00:21:22,046
My prodigal son returns a lawyer.
But no let up on the mischief?

175
00:21:24,516 --> 00:21:28,418
Babu-ji...? (Babu-ji: Father)
- He left for his chambers early...

176
00:21:28,754 --> 00:21:31,222
"something urgent.
- I know, I know"

177
00:21:34,660 --> 00:21:36,127
Complaints every day!

178
00:21:36,495 --> 00:21:40,454
Dev and Paro never went to school.
Dev caught smoking

179
00:21:40,966 --> 00:21:43,935
All day tramping around the village
with that Paro

180
00:21:45,270 --> 00:21:47,738
Not another moment
for you in this house

181
00:21:50,776 --> 00:21:53,711
"The day I left,
he wasn't at home"

182
00:21:54,579 --> 00:21:58,071
"This day I return,
he still isn't here"

183
00:21:59,418 --> 00:22:02,512
"You know, the British government
is knighting him"

184
00:22:03,221 --> 00:22:06,247
I see!
- And he'll be so glad to see you

185
00:22:06,625 --> 00:22:10,061
"Really?
- Glad he is, at work"

186
00:22:10,429 --> 00:22:15,366
"In my home, fathers welcome sons
returning home after years..."

187
00:22:15,734 --> 00:22:19,067
"with arms outstretched.
- Same here, child"

188
00:22:22,741 --> 00:22:24,709
"Come to me, my darling"

189
00:22:30,148 --> 00:22:34,084
I told you to get me
a nice foreign watch

190
00:22:34,419 --> 00:22:36,148
Have you brought it?

191
00:22:37,456 --> 00:22:40,755
"No, but I bring fortuitous times"

192
00:22:43,662 --> 00:22:44,754
Look...

193
00:22:46,531 --> 00:22:49,762
over here... but I can't even
make out clearly

194
00:22:51,470 --> 00:22:55,702
"They use only paper?
- And sometimes, not even that"

195
00:22:56,041 --> 00:22:57,838
I never shook hands

196
00:23:01,713 --> 00:23:03,442
What are you upto?

197
00:23:03,782 --> 00:23:09,243
Give my box back to me

198
00:23:09,721 --> 00:23:11,848
Give it to me

199
00:23:13,725 --> 00:23:15,716
What's happening?
- Nothing

200
00:23:16,828 --> 00:23:19,888
Watching Devdas?
How do you find him?

201
00:23:20,632 --> 00:23:22,395
I'm not telling.
- Tell me...

202
00:23:22,601 --> 00:23:25,263
how do you find him?
- Like a fool

203
00:23:26,438 --> 00:23:29,407
What did he say when he met you?
- I didn't show him my face

204
00:23:29,741 --> 00:23:31,538
swear that by your mother?
- I swear

205
00:23:31,743 --> 00:23:35,042
"Poor thing, must've been pining.
- Let him pine"

206
00:23:35,547 --> 00:23:37,412
Don't make him suffer so

207
00:23:37,749 --> 00:23:40,115
"Else, he'll come peeping
around the door..."

208
00:23:40,452 --> 00:23:43,944
"and ask me,
Kaki-Ma, is Paro in?"

209
00:23:49,761 --> 00:23:53,356
Only in the moonlight
he gets to see my face

210
00:26:38,597 --> 00:26:42,465
Card three and I win.
- Damn

211
00:26:43,802 --> 00:26:46,464
Lost by a whisker.
- You always lose by a whisker

212
00:26:46,805 --> 00:26:52,072
"Kumud, so what if he wins once?
- Wrong, today's shubhankar's day"

213
00:26:52,410 --> 00:26:56,744
"No one else wins, here comes Paro
but she can't win either"

214
00:26:57,315 --> 00:27:01,752
You bet?
- Beware! She'll loot you

215
00:27:03,688 --> 00:27:09,422
"Well Paro, what have you brought?
- "Shondesh" for Devdas. Ma sent it"

216
00:27:11,830 --> 00:27:16,767
Where's Devdas?
- The London-returned gentleman?

217
00:27:17,102 --> 00:27:21,766
"Where else but in his room,
training his binoculars on London?"

218
00:27:33,718 --> 00:27:38,451
"Saw? Earlier, she'd greet you first.
Up she climbs, our beauty..."

219
00:27:38,790 --> 00:27:44,786
straight for Devdas.
- One too many a sweet message

220
00:27:49,334 --> 00:27:54,328
What brings the Moon down to Earth?
- To take your breath away

221
00:27:57,308 --> 00:27:59,868
What are you doing?
- Seeing how good my guess was

222
00:28:00,812 --> 00:28:03,542
Accurate?
- Could never be wrong

223
00:28:04,482 --> 00:28:06,541
How come?
- Known you for ages

224
00:28:10,755 --> 00:28:12,689
What's this?
- Platter

225
00:28:12,924 --> 00:28:16,758
I know. But what's on it?
- My excuse

226
00:28:18,563 --> 00:28:20,758
shondesh for me?
- See for yourself

227
00:28:23,301 --> 00:28:25,769
"Empty...?
- That's the excuse, silly"

228
00:28:28,573 --> 00:28:30,564
Goodness!
What a temper!

229
00:28:30,875 --> 00:28:33,173
You make a fine example
of how to lose temper

230
00:28:33,511 --> 00:28:35,240
You're the same

231
00:28:38,783 --> 00:28:41,775
"You too, are just
like you were"

232
00:28:42,487 --> 00:28:45,081
Like what...?
- Unsophisticated

233
00:28:45,790 --> 00:28:50,784
"Naturally, after all,
you're London-returned"

234
00:28:52,197 --> 00:28:56,861
"London's a big city, isn't it Dev?
- London's entirely different"

235
00:28:57,435 --> 00:29:01,064
"Great personalities, great debates.
Huge thoroughfares, huge edifices"

236
00:29:01,406 --> 00:29:05,502
"London's Trafalgar square,
pigeons, doves..."

237
00:29:07,178 --> 00:29:08,167
The Queen's Palace

238
00:29:08,446 --> 00:29:10,437
"And milling crowds,
everywhere"

239
00:29:11,750 --> 00:29:14,742
Londoners live in a world
of their own

240
00:29:15,253 --> 00:29:16,242
You too?

241
00:29:22,694 --> 00:29:29,293
"Say, you never missed the village?
- Never, never, except..."

242
00:29:31,770 --> 00:29:35,763
"when I was fed up of the food at
the hostel, I missed Ma's dishes"

243
00:29:38,843 --> 00:29:41,778
"And back in London,
when someone screamed at me..."

244
00:29:42,781 --> 00:29:46,239
I was reminded of my father.
No one else

245
00:29:47,786 --> 00:29:51,779
"On evening walks, I contemplated
Dharamdas and his buggy"

246
00:29:52,791 --> 00:29:56,124
"On sleepless nights,
grandmother's gentle pat"

247
00:29:58,229 --> 00:29:59,389
Nothing else

248
00:30:06,137 --> 00:30:07,729
Dev... and...

249
00:30:11,276 --> 00:30:12,868
And...?
- I...?

250
00:30:13,211 --> 00:30:15,543
Never. Or was it once...?

251
00:30:18,616 --> 00:30:22,177
"No, you never came to mind, Paro.
- I never came to mind...?"

252
00:30:22,520 --> 00:30:25,546
Matters that come to mind
are matters that matter. But...

253
00:30:26,758 --> 00:30:32,424
"you don't matter, Paro.
- True Dev, only you matter"

254
00:30:33,765 --> 00:30:40,762
"5 letters, 5 times a day. How many
times did I read them each year?"

255
00:30:43,541 --> 00:30:44,838
And how many times in ten years?
- Multiplied by...?

256
00:30:46,177 --> 00:30:51,376
"18,250 times.
That's how much you matter..."

257
00:30:51,783 --> 00:30:57,449
"and ten years to the day, I have
kept alive the flame I lit for you"

258
00:30:58,423 --> 00:31:03,122
How many hours has it been burning?
- If I were to count...

259
00:31:03,461 --> 00:31:10,731
"87,600 hours. So much you matter,
every second I remembered you"

260
00:31:11,736 --> 00:31:16,730
"How many seconds to a day?
- I know, I'll tell you..."

261
00:31:19,510 --> 00:31:21,410
You're bad at arithmetic

262
00:31:25,216 --> 00:31:30,085
There were times when I missed you.
- When...?

263
00:31:32,523 --> 00:31:34,753
Whenever I breathed

264
00:31:37,762 --> 00:31:42,563
"For them, reminiscences,
those who can be forgotten. Silly"

265
00:31:43,468 --> 00:31:46,767
so effortlessly you counted off
those seconds?

266
00:31:47,639 --> 00:31:49,766
Without as much as a thought
to every passing second...

267
00:31:50,108 --> 00:31:52,099
that carried me away?

268
00:31:53,511 --> 00:31:57,709
"In the flame of the lamp that
you lit, it was I who burned"

269
00:32:13,731 --> 00:32:15,426
87600

270
00:32:19,737 --> 00:32:20,726
Pity

271
00:32:22,373 --> 00:32:27,743
shall I tell you what's
on my mind for sometime?

272
00:32:28,413 --> 00:32:31,974
Two names on your mind.
Paro and Devdas

273
00:32:32,884 --> 00:32:36,320
Mr Landlord! How did you make out?

274
00:32:37,455 --> 00:32:40,754
"Kumud was saying, Dev and Paro
are upto new antics"

275
00:32:41,559 --> 00:32:43,550
For hours they stare at each other
through binoculars

276
00:32:43,761 --> 00:32:48,824
shondesh is her excuse for
coming over. I don't like it

277
00:32:49,634 --> 00:32:53,798
And sumitra is daydreaming
of Paro's wedding to Devdas

278
00:32:54,572 --> 00:32:59,032
Daydreams never come true.
Neelkanth married an actress

279
00:32:59,377 --> 00:33:03,245
Disgraced himself. In an alliance
with a disgraced family...

280
00:33:03,614 --> 00:33:06,742
am I to bring
my family to ridicule...?

281
00:33:07,085 --> 00:33:12,045
"Right, but you know sumitra.
She shoots off her mouth"

282
00:33:12,390 --> 00:33:15,723
What if she storms in someday
proposing an alliance?

283
00:33:16,060 --> 00:33:20,997
"The answer will be "no
"- Why will the answer be no?"

284
00:33:21,466 --> 00:33:26,233
A knight and a landlord. And the
roof over our heads is leaking

285
00:33:26,771 --> 00:33:27,738
Leaking...?

286
00:33:30,341 --> 00:33:33,742
Even my postal address has changed.
- Really...?

287
00:33:35,780 --> 00:33:39,079
"Neelkanth Chakraborty,
Old Mansion"

288
00:33:42,553 --> 00:33:46,853
"What's lacking in our Paro?
She's pretty, she's literate"

289
00:33:47,191 --> 00:33:49,421
I only got to spread the word.
Tens of boys will be ready...

290
00:33:49,794 --> 00:33:52,922
to pay a bride-price for Paro.
- Really?

291
00:33:53,297 --> 00:33:56,824
Yes. You are worrying overmuch

292
00:33:57,735 --> 00:34:00,932
someday we will get a proposal...
from them. You'll see

293
00:34:01,472 --> 00:34:05,101
"Till then, I leave you to
your musings. I'm off for my nap"

294
00:34:11,749 --> 00:34:16,948
Mr Landlord! Have a care!
Your old mansion is crumbling

295
00:34:18,556 --> 00:34:20,353
Broke my back

296
00:34:29,901 --> 00:34:35,066
All this jewellery! All for me?
- You will give me a grandson

297
00:34:35,440 --> 00:34:37,340
Won't I give you something?

298
00:34:37,575 --> 00:34:40,442
Badi-Ma has opened up her
treasure trove. Loot her

299
00:34:41,679 --> 00:34:42,737
I must!

300
00:34:43,281 --> 00:34:46,978
Badi-Ma! How exquisite!
I must wear this

301
00:34:47,351 --> 00:34:51,788
"No, that one isn't for you.
- Then, for whom?"

302
00:34:52,123 --> 00:34:55,786
For my Devdas' bride.
- Let's see

303
00:34:56,727 --> 00:35:00,561
Give it all away to Devdas' bride!
I want none of this

304
00:35:01,532 --> 00:35:03,500
Here's your elder daughter-in-law

305
00:35:03,734 --> 00:35:06,032
And everyone's all agog about
someone who's yet to come

306
00:35:06,471 --> 00:35:10,202
"Nice bracelet, isn't it?
Lt'll look great on your arm"

307
00:35:10,741 --> 00:35:13,403
In my father's house
maids wear bracelets like these

308
00:35:13,845 --> 00:35:16,973
"Then consider yourself a maid,
right Badi-Ma?"

309
00:35:17,482 --> 00:35:22,112
Yes! I'm maidservant in this house.
My brother-in-law! Always after me

310
00:35:24,455 --> 00:35:28,414
You're making a mountain out
of a molehill. I was joking

311
00:35:28,826 --> 00:35:32,421
"If you disapprove, I won't even marry.
- I hate being ridiculed"

312
00:35:33,764 --> 00:35:37,393
Why rib her all the time?
Badi-Ma you could've said yes...

313
00:35:37,768 --> 00:35:41,397
if only to please her. You know
her nature. And she's pregnant

314
00:35:41,772 --> 00:35:44,741
And you've brought her to tears.
Now I got to placate her. Woe betide

315
00:35:48,479 --> 00:35:54,543
"No matter how much honey you add,
neem is always bitter"

316
00:35:56,454 --> 00:35:58,786
How do you like this bracelet?

317
00:36:01,459 --> 00:36:05,156
Just like you. Exotic.
- Whom are you giving it to?

318
00:36:07,798 --> 00:36:09,595
You want to see?

319
00:36:13,571 --> 00:36:15,471
Take this.
- And do what?

320
00:36:15,806 --> 00:36:19,765
Look through it. This bracelet
is for whoever you see in it

321
00:36:25,816 --> 00:36:27,784
Goodness! Sumitra?

322
00:36:30,621 --> 00:36:35,923
"Is she the one? Are you mad?
- Yes, but not entirely. Look up"

323
00:36:37,628 --> 00:36:39,596
That's Parvati.
- Nice...?

324
00:36:39,964 --> 00:36:45,834
"Yes nice, but I see her every day.
- Do you see her as my bride?"

325
00:36:47,705 --> 00:36:49,798
Wretched girl!
- Now what's up?

326
00:36:50,741 --> 00:36:53,505
Staring at me through binoculars!
- Goodness

327
00:36:54,779 --> 00:36:58,579
she's gone hiding.
- She must be embarrassed

328
00:36:59,784 --> 00:37:04,744
Been chatting over binoculars?
- Yes Badi-Ma

329
00:37:05,122 --> 00:37:07,955
"Take a look,
what's the wretch upto?"

330
00:37:09,093 --> 00:37:13,792
Goodness! She's watching me
out of the corner of her eyes

331
00:37:14,699 --> 00:37:16,394
Ran

332
00:37:18,502 --> 00:37:20,800
"Have you run in too, Dev?"

333
00:37:39,624 --> 00:37:40,955
Wretched boy

334
00:37:43,894 --> 00:37:47,887
How to make mountains
out of a molehill...

335
00:37:48,299 --> 00:37:52,793
I'll show my mother-in-law.
Chhoto-Ma...

336
00:38:00,478 --> 00:38:04,847
so you got caught peeping.
- You got caught too

337
00:38:05,182 --> 00:38:08,583
And I was sentenced
to punish you

338
00:38:11,789 --> 00:38:12,915
For you

339
00:38:13,291 --> 00:38:15,191
What...?
- Gift

340
00:38:15,593 --> 00:38:17,356
You might as well put it on me

341
00:38:18,496 --> 00:38:20,464
so many bangles

342
00:38:21,499 --> 00:38:22,466
silly

343
00:38:22,700 --> 00:38:23,496
Forget it

344
00:38:23,801 --> 00:38:26,770
"Tell me, where is London?
- Way west"

345
00:38:27,138 --> 00:38:30,039
Where sets the sun?
- In the West

346
00:38:30,374 --> 00:38:32,808
The sun rises over London
five hours late every day?

347
00:38:33,311 --> 00:38:35,472
Yes
- Is that why you're late...

348
00:38:35,813 --> 00:38:37,781
about understanding everything?
- Yes...

349
00:38:39,483 --> 00:38:42,475
Dolt from London! Can't even
take my bangles off

350
00:38:42,820 --> 00:38:44,788
How will you ever make me wear
a bracelet?

351
00:39:09,780 --> 00:39:15,446
My cruel lover is heartless

352
00:39:19,957 --> 00:39:24,985
My cruel lover is so heartless...

353
00:39:26,530 --> 00:39:31,467
"he doesn't even know how I pine,
he's just a ruthless slaver..."

354
00:39:31,802 --> 00:39:33,793
"oh cruel, please..."

355
00:39:36,574 --> 00:39:42,376
"How do I say this,
whom do I tell?"

356
00:39:42,813 --> 00:39:48,376
"God, he doesn't know how I hurt..."

357
00:39:48,819 --> 00:39:50,616
he knows not...

358
00:39:53,424 --> 00:39:55,892
how heartless

359
00:40:30,494 --> 00:40:34,225
"You were far away,
yet so close..."

360
00:40:34,565 --> 00:40:38,126
"now you're close
yet distant...?"

361
00:40:38,536 --> 00:40:40,800
"I don't know...
yet I know"

362
00:40:41,172 --> 00:40:47,509
"You were far away, yet so close...
now you're close, yet distant...?"

363
00:40:50,581 --> 00:40:51,570
Come...

364
00:40:51,816 --> 00:40:53,078
to me

365
00:40:53,751 --> 00:40:58,916
Adorn me with the bangle
- Let me read your palm

366
00:41:00,524 --> 00:41:02,515
Don't tease me
- Lots of money

367
00:41:02,760 --> 00:41:05,888
Now don't...
- Your marriage

368
00:41:06,230 --> 00:41:08,425
Do my bidding
- You'll marry an old man

369
00:41:08,766 --> 00:41:11,758
How do I say this...
- About your wedding

370
00:41:12,102 --> 00:41:14,434
Whom do I tell... God
- You'll never marry

371
00:41:20,010 --> 00:41:24,344
"Fool, he doesn't even know..."

372
00:41:24,782 --> 00:41:28,183
he just doesn't know

373
00:41:29,987 --> 00:41:31,113
shame!

374
00:42:23,674 --> 00:42:28,168
You see how the childhood love
blossoms into youthful romance?

375
00:42:29,513 --> 00:42:33,108
"For all sumitra's "shondesh",
do send a sweet message to sumitra"

376
00:42:33,784 --> 00:42:37,447
"Tell her, Paro has come of age"

377
00:42:40,791 --> 00:42:42,782
What are you upto?

378
00:42:47,598 --> 00:42:49,589
What am I upto?

379
00:42:51,535 --> 00:42:55,904
What's up? What's wrong with Ma?
- Your mother has gone mad.

380
00:42:56,440 --> 00:43:03,744
Yes! Mad with joy. Because no more
will I dream the dream I dreamt

381
00:43:04,248 --> 00:43:07,183
And why?
- Because it's coming true

382
00:43:07,518 --> 00:43:11,420
"Ma, what dream...?
- Which dream? Silly!"

383
00:43:11,755 --> 00:43:15,555
"I'm invited to a huge mansion.
- I know, Kumud has conceived"

384
00:43:15,893 --> 00:43:21,763
"Also, Kaushalya-Didi wants to see
me. She says, Paro has come of age"

385
00:43:22,099 --> 00:43:25,432
We ought to think
about Paro's wedding

386
00:43:29,506 --> 00:43:33,442
"True Paro, when you step into
that house in bridal finery..."

387
00:43:33,777 --> 00:43:38,908
"there will be dreams in your eyes,
under the veil drawn over your face"

388
00:43:39,650 --> 00:43:44,110
But we'll listen in joyous rapture
for the chime in your anklets

389
00:43:55,733 --> 00:44:03,299
Mr Landlord! So how do I look?
- Where's Paro? Isn't she going?

390
00:44:03,741 --> 00:44:07,541
"So long she awaited this evening,
she was dressed and raring to go"

391
00:44:07,911 --> 00:44:11,540
"In time to leave, she shies away.
Off to the lake to fetch water"

392
00:44:11,915 --> 00:44:14,406
"Why?
- Silly girl, she's afraid..."

393
00:44:14,752 --> 00:44:17,744
that I might discuss her marriage
right in front of her

394
00:44:18,422 --> 00:44:23,018
Don't you raise the topic sumitra
- The auspicious time runs out at 7

395
00:44:23,360 --> 00:44:25,920
"By then if she hasn't raised
the topic, I shall"

396
00:44:27,765 --> 00:44:34,068
"But don't worry. The answer
won't be a "no". Bless me"

397
00:44:36,073 --> 00:44:39,338
The guests are all here.
Where is sumitra-Kaki?

398
00:44:39,777 --> 00:44:44,441
Dreaming of Paro's wedding.
To Devdas. You know...

399
00:44:44,782 --> 00:44:47,774
I've found a nice match for Paro.
- Who...?

400
00:44:48,786 --> 00:44:51,584
Old Mr Chattopadhyay

401
00:44:56,427 --> 00:44:59,988
"My compliments, sister!
Best wishes for a grandson"

402
00:45:00,330 --> 00:45:04,061
"Don't overdo it, sumitra.
There's still time to go"

403
00:45:04,401 --> 00:45:07,199
"Only a few months, no?"

404
00:45:07,538 --> 00:45:10,735
Then the baby's wails
will resonate through the mansion

405
00:45:11,742 --> 00:45:16,406
"Not sister, I'll call you grandma.
- You should get Paro married soon"

406
00:45:16,747 --> 00:45:22,743
I'd like to call you grannie too.
- That's what I'm here to discuss

407
00:45:23,187 --> 00:45:28,454
I must discuss something too. Girls
in your family fetch a bride price?

408
00:45:28,859 --> 00:45:34,161
"No, that was olden custom.
We will give our Paro away"

409
00:45:34,531 --> 00:45:39,400
so it's final. I'll give Paro away
in wedding. All the expense is mine

410
00:45:39,770 --> 00:45:43,433
"Paro is my daughter too.
- No, giving the daughter away..."

411
00:45:43,774 --> 00:45:47,574
"is a dream every parent dreams.
About the expense, we can share it"

412
00:45:47,945 --> 00:45:51,403
"Then it's decided, sumitra.
- Really Didi?"

413
00:45:51,782 --> 00:45:54,444
"Yes, really.
- Therefore Kaki-Ma, you will be..."

414
00:45:54,785 --> 00:46:00,451
the master of ceremonies tonight.
A stunning dance for the guests?

415
00:46:00,791 --> 00:46:03,123
"Oh no, not I...
- Why not? Don't you belong..."

416
00:46:03,460 --> 00:46:09,228
"to a family of theatre dancers?
- Yes Didi, but that was ages ago"

417
00:46:09,566 --> 00:46:15,471
"No Kaki-Ma, no excuses.
Tonight you sing and you dance"

418
00:46:15,806 --> 00:46:20,470
"No dear, not I...
- Are you embarrassed? Just imagine"

419
00:46:20,811 --> 00:46:25,805
"You're dancing at Paro's wedding.
- Now I can't refuse, can I?"

420
00:46:26,717 --> 00:46:30,312
So be it. Radha and Krishna
and love divine

421
00:46:30,954 --> 00:46:36,415
Dearest love

422
00:47:41,825 --> 00:47:43,793
The Moon alone...

423
00:47:44,127 --> 00:47:46,027
in night's embrace...

424
00:47:51,835 --> 00:47:55,771
"in moonlight vigil,
night's desire..."

425
00:48:10,954 --> 00:48:13,445
"sang run-jhun run-jhun
"a breeZing gust..."

426
00:48:13,790 --> 00:48:16,088
into a radiant night...

427
00:48:16,526 --> 00:48:20,519
"rode in fireflies
on a palanquin of stars..."

428
00:48:20,931 --> 00:48:26,130
"as the word played
on stilled lips"

429
00:48:26,536 --> 00:48:28,527
"Then to the cadence
of drums and cymbals..."

430
00:48:28,805 --> 00:48:30,796
"the duffle was struck...
then..."

431
00:48:31,141 --> 00:48:33,132
into the rhythm swayed...

432
00:48:33,477 --> 00:48:35,468
my lovely Radha

433
00:48:35,812 --> 00:48:40,511
Into the rhythm Radha swayed

434
00:48:40,851 --> 00:48:45,811
"Then he came from nowhere
and he said... I love you"

435
00:48:46,924 --> 00:48:49,825
Dear love...

436
00:48:50,894 --> 00:48:54,557
oh but I'm afraid

437
00:49:26,730 --> 00:49:29,198
Oh dearest love

438
00:50:07,804 --> 00:50:11,763
"No, not my wrist..."

439
00:50:12,809 --> 00:50:16,768
"oh, how shameful"

440
00:50:19,883 --> 00:50:21,783
Leave me...

441
00:50:22,819 --> 00:50:24,912
I beg of you

442
00:50:27,524 --> 00:50:30,960
"No, don't force me..."

443
00:50:32,829 --> 00:50:34,456
spare me

444
00:50:34,831 --> 00:50:36,799
Dear love

445
00:50:37,534 --> 00:50:39,365
No...

446
00:50:39,836 --> 00:50:41,804
I'll curse you for this

447
00:50:42,172 --> 00:50:43,799
Madman! Go away

448
00:50:44,174 --> 00:50:45,266
Don't torment me

449
00:50:45,642 --> 00:50:47,405
Oh dearest love...

450
00:50:48,612 --> 00:50:51,046
dear love...

451
00:50:52,616 --> 00:50:55,744
oh but I'm afraid

452
00:51:08,465 --> 00:51:11,161
Love me

453
00:51:14,471 --> 00:51:16,439
On the banks of the Yamuna...

454
00:51:16,807 --> 00:51:19,275
"Krishna and Radha
in the Dance of Love"

455
00:51:24,347 --> 00:51:26,315
"Of desire in their hearts
rose a song to their lips"

456
00:51:26,683 --> 00:51:28,674
"Krishna and Radha
in the Dance of Love"

457
00:51:33,457 --> 00:51:35,448
"Thirsting in every breath,
searing passion in their hearts..."

458
00:51:35,826 --> 00:51:37,794
"Krishna and Radha
in the Dance of Love"

459
00:51:42,232 --> 00:51:46,532
"The word on stilled lips,
Krishna and Radha are in love"

460
00:52:06,957 --> 00:52:08,424
What is this?

461
00:52:08,792 --> 00:52:10,760
The token of betrothal...

462
00:52:11,595 --> 00:52:15,497
of my daughter to your son.
Paro and Devdas

463
00:52:20,537 --> 00:52:25,372
"Are you in your senses, sumitra?
I invited mother and daughter..."

464
00:52:25,809 --> 00:52:29,301
to entertain my guests
with some melodrama

465
00:52:30,514 --> 00:52:32,482
"Instead, you are out
to work magic?"

466
00:52:33,817 --> 00:52:40,154
"Kumud, you were right!
Sumitra-Kaki's timing is opportune"

467
00:52:41,224 --> 00:52:44,489
she does knows how to
take advantage of opportunity

468
00:52:45,529 --> 00:52:48,828
"As a child, her daughter stole
guavas from our orchards"

469
00:52:49,833 --> 00:52:55,999
"Now she sets her sights on my son?
- No Didi, that isn't true"

470
00:52:56,773 --> 00:52:59,571
Devdas and Paro were
childhood sweethearts

471
00:52:59,910 --> 00:53:02,470
"They are in love, they can't live
without each other"

472
00:53:02,846 --> 00:53:08,580
"In a large family, maybe you never
noticed. But I know how they yearn"

473
00:53:09,886 --> 00:53:14,118
"Please do not refuse Didi,
even if it means..."

474
00:53:14,491 --> 00:53:16,459
that you will have nothing more
to do with me afterwards

475
00:53:16,793 --> 00:53:22,754
Why draw water from poisoned wells?
You may not betray the traits

476
00:53:23,133 --> 00:53:26,125
"But your genes remain the same,
that of the dancing girls"

477
00:53:26,503 --> 00:53:28,471
"Yes, we landlords eat fish..."

478
00:53:28,838 --> 00:53:31,466
but we won't let bones
stick in the gullet

479
00:53:31,808 --> 00:53:35,767
"For one, you are a neighbour.
Worse, as a family, disgraced"

480
00:53:36,146 --> 00:53:41,812
"Even if you may momentarily forget
your disgrace, but your standing?"

481
00:53:42,319 --> 00:53:45,311
Don't you try to palm off
your bad coin

482
00:53:45,689 --> 00:53:51,821
"Chhoto-Ma, let it pass Chhoto-Ma.
We can always talk Dev out of it"

483
00:53:53,463 --> 00:53:59,333
"Which leaves Parvati. If she can't
contain herself, send her to Dev"

484
00:53:59,769 --> 00:54:02,260
Honour among landlords
isn't sullied by such affairs

485
00:54:02,772 --> 00:54:08,574
Unbecoming of a landlord's woman!
Don't interfere when elders speak

486
00:54:09,446 --> 00:54:13,780
Enough! Replying to you
is beneath my dignity

487
00:54:15,485 --> 00:54:20,787
"My sister you were.
From now on, merely Kaushalya"

488
00:54:21,258 --> 00:54:27,254
"And Kaushalya, you too sang
the day my daughter was born"

489
00:54:28,498 --> 00:54:31,797
Remember Badi-Ma? She took
my daughter from my arms...

490
00:54:32,135 --> 00:54:37,095
"saying Paro was her daughter!
With a smile, I had even said yes"

491
00:54:37,507 --> 00:54:40,476
Little did I know that even
in the big landlord's mansion...

492
00:54:40,810 --> 00:54:44,473
a lady of the house could be
so narrow-minded...

493
00:54:44,814 --> 00:54:48,511
as to count guavas stolen
from one of her orchards

494
00:54:48,852 --> 00:54:53,789
"Count, how many guavas did
my daughter steal? Tell me"

495
00:54:54,457 --> 00:54:59,087
Counting guavas?
By the count of it...

496
00:54:59,429 --> 00:55:04,924
I've fed your son many more times
than your count of stolen guava

497
00:55:06,469 --> 00:55:08,027
stolen

498
00:55:08,571 --> 00:55:14,305
"And the disgrace?
Yes, we do sell our daughters"

499
00:55:14,644 --> 00:55:19,445
"But you trade too, Kaushalya.
We sell our daughters, openly"

500
00:55:19,783 --> 00:55:22,775
But you swallow the dowries
and the daughters too

501
00:55:24,788 --> 00:55:31,318
"Good or bad, the coin is known by
it's tinkle. But you wouldn't know"

502
00:55:32,495 --> 00:55:37,455
Because you're deaf enough
not to know your son's heart

503
00:55:37,801 --> 00:55:41,897
"Blind you are, that you
do not see their love"

504
00:55:42,272 --> 00:55:47,039
Now soon you will stand dumbstruck
in witness your son's ruination

505
00:55:50,480 --> 00:55:58,387
"I swear, my daughter will marry
into a family richer than yours"

506
00:55:58,822 --> 00:56:05,819
"In a week. If I fail, then come,
mourn my death on day eight"

507
00:56:06,830 --> 00:56:11,494
I came to wish that you would beget
a handsome son

508
00:56:11,835 --> 00:56:18,832
But all I can wish is to see
that a daughter you be given

509
00:56:37,861 --> 00:56:40,523
I hear your mother
is giving you away...

510
00:56:40,864 --> 00:56:44,664
into a rich family.
Do you know your husband's name?

511
00:56:45,969 --> 00:56:49,234
Devdas.
- Even after all that happened...

512
00:56:49,572 --> 00:56:52,097
will Dev marry you?
- I'll ask him and I'll tell you

513
00:56:52,442 --> 00:56:57,379
Is there anything left to ask?
She was insulted so gravely

514
00:56:57,814 --> 00:57:01,807
"Dev didn't insult her, did he?
- Will you walk up..."

515
00:57:02,152 --> 00:57:04,916
to ask Dev to marry you?
Won't that be embarrassing?

516
00:57:05,255 --> 00:57:08,816
Why be embarrassed about asking
for what is yours?

517
00:57:10,059 --> 00:57:17,124
"You're married, yet you don't
know what a husband means?"

518
00:57:47,564 --> 00:57:49,361
Who...?
- I

519
00:58:17,627 --> 00:58:19,390
Are you all right?

520
00:58:20,897 --> 00:58:23,161
So late at night?
In the dark...?

521
00:58:24,834 --> 00:58:29,498
"Weren't you afraid?
- No, now I'm afraid of no one"

522
00:58:29,839 --> 00:58:33,832
"Not even of being maligned?
- No, when I am with you..."

523
00:58:34,177 --> 00:58:38,944
I don't even care about getting
a bad name

524
00:58:40,583 --> 00:58:45,316
Why... here... now...?
- Why does the river head to sea?

525
00:58:45,855 --> 00:58:48,415
Why does the sunflower
always face the sun?

526
00:58:48,858 --> 00:58:51,850
And why comes Paro
heedless of her dignity...?

527
00:58:52,195 --> 00:58:55,460
Why unheeding my family honour
do I venture out in dark of night?

528
00:58:55,798 --> 00:59:00,792
"Why do I seek refuge at your feet?
To all questions, a single answer"

529
00:59:01,571 --> 00:59:05,803
"For the same reply, far too many
questions asking to be answered"

530
00:59:06,509 --> 00:59:09,478
"There are no questions,
not as long as we're together"

531
00:59:10,446 --> 00:59:14,815
That's what they don't want.
- What do you want?

532
00:59:15,485 --> 00:59:17,146
"Happiness, for you"

533
00:59:19,689 --> 00:59:22,817
But my father won't look at it
from our perspective

534
00:59:24,327 --> 00:59:26,318
We'll win him over

535
00:59:30,533 --> 00:59:32,398
What if he doesn't relent?

536
00:59:32,835 --> 00:59:38,137
"Where there's love, there's no fear.
- Where there's smoke there's fire"

537
00:59:38,708 --> 00:59:43,270
"In fires of attrition,
I don't want us..."

538
00:59:43,713 --> 00:59:46,648
"to be consumed.
- I'm doomed, in any case"

539
00:59:47,016 --> 00:59:49,849
"Be it with you, or without you"

540
00:59:54,490 --> 00:59:58,256
Let me drop you home.
- You're coming with me?

541
01:00:00,496 --> 01:00:02,464
Without fear of censure?

542
01:00:18,815 --> 01:00:22,615
Even the cur is wary of the door
it's kicked out of

543
01:00:23,720 --> 01:00:27,816
"What you can't get away with by
light of the day, you try by night?"

544
01:00:28,458 --> 01:00:30,824
"Why don't you, mother and daughter
start a brothel?"

545
01:00:37,634 --> 01:00:41,593
Not even a pimp would advise
his daughter to do that

546
01:00:53,783 --> 01:00:57,947
"With the lamp,
I saw you burn for Devdas"

547
01:00:58,788 --> 01:01:04,124
I treasure your feelings. Were you
to have asked me before leaving...

548
01:01:04,460 --> 01:01:09,454
I would not even mind if you were
to have been whore for a night

549
01:01:09,799 --> 01:01:13,792
"Ma, I just went to ask him!
- And received what in reply?"

550
01:01:15,104 --> 01:01:21,065
"Not alone, you carried with you,
the honour of our family"

551
01:01:22,545 --> 01:01:26,037
Have you left your honour behind?

552
01:01:28,718 --> 01:01:33,815
Let it pass Babu-ji. Why make
a mountain out of a molehill?

553
01:01:34,223 --> 01:01:37,488
"By the way, what to do
about Paro's shawl?"

554
01:01:37,827 --> 01:01:41,820
Tell him to return it.
This marriage isn't happening

555
01:01:42,331 --> 01:01:44,322
I shall do no such thing

556
01:01:46,836 --> 01:01:49,634
You forget whom you are addressing

557
01:01:53,876 --> 01:01:58,472
A hot-headed landlord who will send
his fellow-man's daughter...

558
01:01:58,881 --> 01:02:02,442
to a brothel.
- Gentlemen's daughters...

559
01:02:02,785 --> 01:02:06,448
never steal out of
neighbours' rooms at 2 am

560
01:02:08,691 --> 01:02:13,458
so great was her compulsion
and it was you who compelled her

561
01:02:15,331 --> 01:02:18,664
I will brook no argument from you.
- Nor do I wish to talk to you

562
01:02:19,702 --> 01:02:21,135
It's decided

563
01:02:25,808 --> 01:02:28,504
Our family ranks far higher
than theirs

564
01:02:31,814 --> 01:02:36,808
"Yet, it's the same food we eat?
- Our hierarchy, status, standing"

565
01:02:38,821 --> 01:02:41,517
Even the British government
is informed of us

566
01:02:43,626 --> 01:02:47,084
"Yet, the same soil we tread upon?
- The bird that soars..."

567
01:02:47,430 --> 01:02:51,366
can never have any relationship
with fish in the waters

568
01:02:51,701 --> 01:02:55,762
"Yet, man on Earth relates
to God in Heaven?"

569
01:03:15,892 --> 01:03:17,587
Stop Dev

570
01:03:17,927 --> 01:03:20,794
"Dev, everything can be resolved.
I'll talk to Babu-ji"

571
01:03:21,130 --> 01:03:23,496
But don't leave the house.
- No Dwij

572
01:03:23,866 --> 01:03:25,424
Childishness!

573
01:03:25,802 --> 01:03:28,134
"Over something so trivial...?
- Trivial for you, not for me"

574
01:03:28,437 --> 01:03:30,462
Not for me a life praying
for every breath

575
01:03:30,807 --> 01:03:33,537
"Dev, we'll talk to Babu-ji...
- stop Dev"

576
01:03:33,876 --> 01:03:37,141
Dev stop.
- Stop! Listen to me

577
01:03:37,513 --> 01:03:39,276
"stop him, Kumud"

578
01:03:40,483 --> 01:03:42,815
You aren't going anywhere. Your
mother is talking to the master

579
01:03:43,152 --> 01:03:45,143
Everything will be fine.
- No Dharamdas

580
01:03:45,488 --> 01:03:48,355
"The tempest ought to pass.
If I stay on, much will be undone"

581
01:03:48,691 --> 01:03:49,680
Listen to me

582
01:03:49,959 --> 01:03:51,153
Lady...

583
01:03:51,527 --> 01:03:53,256
"Dev is leaving, Paro"

584
01:03:54,463 --> 01:03:59,298
It's as much his test as it is
yours. See for yourself...

585
01:03:59,702 --> 01:04:03,433
"what he cares for, you or family?
Is he taking you with him?"

586
01:04:03,773 --> 01:04:06,435
Or is he deserting you?
If he isn't taking you along...

587
01:04:06,776 --> 01:04:09,939
then you shall do
your mother's bidding

588
01:04:11,781 --> 01:04:14,147
stop Deva! I won't let you leave!

589
01:04:14,483 --> 01:04:17,577
Stop.
- Out of my way

590
01:04:41,510 --> 01:04:44,502
"That night, all sense
of reasoning deserted me"

591
01:04:44,881 --> 01:04:47,475
"I was left vacillating
as if between pendulous scales"

592
01:04:47,817 --> 01:04:51,981
"You wouldn't want me to displease
my father to make you happy..."

593
01:04:52,822 --> 01:04:54,756
would you?

594
01:04:55,758 --> 01:05:01,560
"Why does the river go to sea?
Why the sunflower gaZes at the sun?"

595
01:05:02,665 --> 01:05:07,466
"Instead of hunting answers,
why not let the question pass?"

596
01:05:08,204 --> 01:05:14,268
"What was between us, was no more
than childishness. There's no love"

597
01:05:14,777 --> 01:05:17,439
"From now onwards,
you are the girl next-door"

598
01:05:17,780 --> 01:05:19,941
"And I, your friend"

599
01:05:20,283 --> 01:05:25,778
"Paro, get dressed, come downstairs.
Hurry. Your in-laws are here"

600
01:05:36,599 --> 01:05:41,093
"My love! Oh why did you
leave me smouldering?"

601
01:05:41,804 --> 01:05:44,500
Why did you snub out the flame?

602
01:05:50,546 --> 01:05:52,138
Ei Dev...

603
01:05:52,648 --> 01:05:59,247
"Friend, you aren't asleep yet?
Are you a stranger in my home?"

604
01:06:01,724 --> 01:06:06,821
"I told you before, this is
as much your home as it's mine"

605
01:06:07,596 --> 01:06:10,656
"Nothing of the sort, Chuni Babu.
I'm just not feeling sleepy"

606
01:06:13,602 --> 01:06:15,832
Drink up...

607
01:06:18,874 --> 01:06:22,037
You know I don't drink.
- Then what gives?

608
01:06:22,411 --> 01:06:26,347
"If "h" is for happiness in life,
why are you so looking so harassed?"

609
01:06:26,682 --> 01:06:32,120
So harried as not to feel at home?
- Nothing of the sort

610
01:06:32,455 --> 01:06:33,513
But something surely is!

611
01:06:33,889 --> 01:06:37,381
"The "h" that makes a home
is the same that spells hurt"

612
01:06:38,561 --> 01:06:40,859
Fought with your parents?
- No

613
01:06:41,964 --> 01:06:44,023
Or are you nursing
a wounded heart?

614
01:06:48,771 --> 01:06:54,209
My point! That's my point!
H for heart and for hurt

615
01:06:54,543 --> 01:06:57,512
"And the two are related
so closely my friend, oh-so-closely"

616
01:06:57,847 --> 01:07:00,475
"Hindustan or English-stan,
everywhere it's all the same"

617
01:07:00,850 --> 01:07:07,813
H for heart and for hurt.
- Have you suffered no pain?

618
01:07:08,557 --> 01:07:13,426
Ask not of one Time has weathered
what pain each nuance hides...

619
01:07:13,863 --> 01:07:16,593
for men may see but no more
than a smiling face

620
01:07:16,999 --> 01:07:22,437
You know what I make family with.
Just me and my wealth

621
01:07:22,872 --> 01:07:26,205
And therefore it was
that I adopted music

622
01:07:26,675 --> 01:07:31,840
"The "Thumri" for my daughter,
and the "Dadra", my son"

623
01:07:33,883 --> 01:07:43,349
"The "w" in words is tricky, making for
warmth, worn, wealth, worlds, wisdom..."

624
01:07:43,893 --> 01:07:51,857
wastrels and wishes. Worship too.
A well-wisher and your waywardness

625
01:07:54,403 --> 01:08:01,639
Get over this insanity and let's
go away. Way away. I feel walled-in

626
01:08:04,847 --> 01:08:11,810
"But Chuni Babu, where to?
- Wherever you wish"

627
01:08:12,421 --> 01:08:14,389
Where you go every night

628
01:08:17,660 --> 01:08:21,528
"There, where the anklets tinkle?"

629
01:08:59,034 --> 01:09:02,561
"How are you ladies?
Look, whom I've brought to you"

630
01:09:02,838 --> 01:09:06,797
Who is it?
- My classmate from London

631
01:09:07,309 --> 01:09:11,803
"Where are you lost Dev Babu?
Come, here too I hold court"

632
01:09:12,548 --> 01:09:15,039
"Welcome my friend, enter"

633
01:09:57,159 --> 01:09:58,683
Chandramukhi

634
01:09:59,995 --> 01:10:05,524
Your mirror couldn't bear to see
my face. I'm sorry for your loss

635
01:10:06,835 --> 01:10:14,241
"If sorrow be joy's harbinger, every
loss signals what gain shall be?"

636
01:10:14,877 --> 01:10:19,814
Wonderful Chandramukhi!
Even your words are so seductive

637
01:10:22,151 --> 01:10:27,282
"But do use the kohl, to ward off
the stranger's evil eye"

638
01:10:30,025 --> 01:10:32,858
You are much amused?
- Naturally

639
01:10:34,096 --> 01:10:36,621
I see someone trying
to ward off the evil eye...

640
01:10:36,865 --> 01:10:39,527
while women
on the marketplace...

641
01:10:39,868 --> 01:10:42,837
vie to be seen

642
01:10:44,873 --> 01:10:49,606
You touch upon eyespeak
and you have stolen my heart

643
01:10:50,246 --> 01:10:54,774
"What I took for stone,
breathes the life into me"

644
01:10:57,820 --> 01:11:00,721
"so you see Dev Babu?
On "c" and Chandramukhi..."

645
01:11:00,823 --> 01:11:03,553
didn't I warn you she's
cause of such amaZement?

646
01:11:03,826 --> 01:11:06,795
"Chuni Babu also begins with a "c"

647
01:11:10,833 --> 01:11:13,631
Of c's and cause celebres
and Chandramukhi...

648
01:11:13,936 --> 01:11:16,837
you saw how clumsy
she made me look?

649
01:11:53,876 --> 01:11:56,811
Jasmine makes fragrant...

650
01:11:57,046 --> 01:12:00,209
her lovely dark tresses

651
01:12:01,450 --> 01:12:05,216
"Radha's face is aglow, electric"

652
01:12:05,821 --> 01:12:08,790
"Her gait, seductive"

653
01:12:51,867 --> 01:12:55,200
Krishna stopped her

654
01:12:57,406 --> 01:12:59,533
He surprised Radha with a kiss

655
01:12:59,808 --> 01:13:01,799
surprised Radha with a kiss...

656
01:13:01,977 --> 01:13:03,137
with a kiss

657
01:13:03,212 --> 01:13:09,014
Radha's veil was slipping away

658
01:13:15,290 --> 01:13:21,627
"Do not tease me,
Radha pleaded"

659
01:13:22,831 --> 01:13:26,824
Why are you teasing me?

660
01:13:42,284 --> 01:13:45,845
But Krishna was obstinate

661
01:13:46,188 --> 01:13:49,851
He shamed Radha

662
01:14:01,804 --> 01:14:05,137
"That night,
Krishna wouldn't listen"

663
01:14:05,441 --> 01:14:11,209
"But whom could Radha complain to?
Krishna wouldn't listen"

664
01:14:13,081 --> 01:14:17,040
"Oh, why are you teasing me?"

665
01:14:42,244 --> 01:14:45,611
A pot of milk...

666
01:14:45,781 --> 01:14:47,840
Radha carried on her head...

667
01:14:48,016 --> 01:14:49,847
when she heard...

668
01:14:49,918 --> 01:14:51,749
Krishna's footsteps...

669
01:14:51,854 --> 01:14:53,754
and her heart...

670
01:14:53,856 --> 01:14:57,121
skipped a beat

671
01:15:07,569 --> 01:15:13,132
"Radha pleaded, don't hold my arms
so hard, then her bangles broke"

672
01:15:34,863 --> 01:15:37,627
But that night...

673
01:15:37,833 --> 01:15:41,826
"whom could Radha complain to?
Krishna wouldn't listen"

674
01:15:42,237 --> 01:15:45,638
Oh stop teasing me

675
01:16:32,688 --> 01:16:34,815
Mesmeric

676
01:16:35,357 --> 01:16:41,990
"Where are you off to? Tarry,
the night has just come of age"

677
01:16:42,497 --> 01:16:47,628
I made a big mistake! I shouldn't
have written that letter to Paro

678
01:16:49,838 --> 01:16:54,707
"I want to go to Paro.
- Who's Paro? Wait, wait for me"

679
01:16:58,580 --> 01:17:01,014
"Bad manners, walking out
on a performance"

680
01:17:01,183 --> 01:17:03,845
Dancing to an audience
of drunken men...

681
01:17:04,252 --> 01:17:06,243
is shamelessness

682
01:17:10,859 --> 01:17:14,852
"You are a woman, Chandramukhi.
Realise who you are"

683
01:17:15,330 --> 01:17:19,664
"Woman, mother, sister,
wife, friend"

684
01:17:20,869 --> 01:17:23,133
When she is none...

685
01:17:23,271 --> 01:17:25,262
she is whore

686
01:17:25,874 --> 01:17:28,172
"Could you be some else,
Chandramukhi?"

687
01:17:31,279 --> 01:17:33,679
Price. For our time together

688
01:17:34,216 --> 01:17:36,684
Keep it

689
01:17:42,391 --> 01:17:43,881
Friend...

690
01:17:44,893 --> 01:17:48,693
"see? Someone I wanted
to stay on, is gone"

691
01:17:51,299 --> 01:17:56,828
In what are you lost?
- Such anguish in those eyes

692
01:17:59,174 --> 01:18:03,076
Does anguish make you anxious?

693
01:18:05,080 --> 01:18:10,643
Have courtesans no hearts?
Is she denied the right to love?

694
01:18:10,852 --> 01:18:15,186
"Of course! If there be amour,
paramour there is too"

695
01:18:15,857 --> 01:18:18,189
Will you do me a favour?
- Say it

696
01:18:18,527 --> 01:18:21,360
"For just once,
will you bring him?"

697
01:18:21,863 --> 01:18:26,857
"Promise, I cannot. But try, I shall.
Only for you"

698
01:18:28,270 --> 01:18:32,866
Look at her! Paro is as resplendent
as the Moon tonight

699
01:18:36,378 --> 01:18:41,077
"Had Devdas been here,
he'd know what he has lost"

700
01:18:41,416 --> 01:18:43,350
My Paro is lucky

701
01:18:43,552 --> 01:18:45,782
Her wedding procession is coming
all the way from Manikpur...

702
01:18:45,887 --> 01:18:48,219
like a train of lights.
- You haven't seen it

703
01:18:48,356 --> 01:18:51,757
The bride's mother must not watch
her daughter's wedding procession

704
01:18:51,993 --> 01:18:54,621
Lest the mother gives
the bride the evil eye

705
01:18:54,930 --> 01:18:59,162
And after tonight no one will ever
call her Paro

706
01:19:00,836 --> 01:19:02,565
Just Parvati

707
01:19:02,871 --> 01:19:04,634
Kaki-Ma (Kaki Ma: Aunt)

708
01:19:06,341 --> 01:19:08,138
Is Paro in?

709
01:19:13,582 --> 01:19:16,244
The wedding procession
is about to arrive

710
01:19:16,852 --> 01:19:20,253
"You can see her.
Let's go, Manorama"

711
01:19:28,997 --> 01:19:31,465
I'm back Paro

712
01:19:32,234 --> 01:19:35,863
Why?
- I've come back to you. Forever

713
01:19:36,471 --> 01:19:38,871
When my wedding procession
is at my door?

714
01:19:40,942 --> 01:19:47,677
There's still time. I'll convince
my parents. I'll tell them...

715
01:19:47,783 --> 01:19:53,551
Your parents! Haven't I...?
If honour matters to your family...

716
01:19:53,789 --> 01:19:57,316
doesn't honour matter to us?
Your father may be a landlord

717
01:19:57,826 --> 01:20:03,492
Doesn't my father count? No matter
how lowly we bride-sellers are...

718
01:20:03,899 --> 01:20:07,835
"we never cheat anyone.
- I never cheated you, Paro"

719
01:20:08,069 --> 01:20:11,334
Then why did you leave me?
And that letter?

720
01:20:11,606 --> 01:20:15,508
"Paro you know, your Dev never does
anything deliberately"

721
01:20:16,978 --> 01:20:18,843
I was naive

722
01:20:19,848 --> 01:20:25,514
"Naivete! How naive can you be Dev?
On a whim, you give me a bracelet?"

723
01:20:25,854 --> 01:20:29,119
"On a whim, you write saying
there's no love lost! Naivete?"

724
01:20:29,858 --> 01:20:34,591
Paro forever... another whim?
- Paro! Your wedding procession

725
01:20:37,666 --> 01:20:39,657
Time to part

726
01:20:41,136 --> 01:20:44,401
I don't accept this marriage!
- What difference? I accept

727
01:20:45,273 --> 01:20:51,678
"Then, I'm going to tell everyone...
- I went to see you at 2 am"

728
01:20:52,614 --> 01:20:56,380
You want to malign me?
- I... malign you?

729
01:20:56,818 --> 01:21:00,310
How could you think?
If you ever say that again...

730
01:21:00,455 --> 01:21:03,720
What will you do? Hit me?
Ever since I was a child...

731
01:21:03,825 --> 01:21:07,488
have you held me in fief?
And when I ask for my right...

732
01:21:07,629 --> 01:21:11,429
you do a volte face?
- Enough! Stop it Paro

733
01:21:13,001 --> 01:21:16,164
such vanity is no good.
- Why should I not be vain?

734
01:21:16,838 --> 01:21:20,501
"What are you Dev,
but wealthy and handsome?"

735
01:21:21,243 --> 01:21:25,839
"I possess virtues, beauty.
And after tonight, riches too"

736
01:21:26,381 --> 01:21:28,849
"From now on, I am more
than an equal to you"

737
01:21:29,251 --> 01:21:33,187
"If you be a landlord, I take pride
in being an aristocrat"

738
01:21:40,128 --> 01:21:42,119
such vanity?

739
01:21:42,864 --> 01:21:48,860
Not even the Moon is as vain.
- But the Moon is scarred

740
01:22:05,820 --> 01:22:07,811
What have you done?

741
01:22:09,824 --> 01:22:16,627
"I have scarred you, like the Moon.
With the mark of my love"

742
01:22:51,766 --> 01:22:56,203
On joyous night...

743
01:22:57,238 --> 01:23:03,143
"when her bridal procession
arrived..."

744
01:23:03,945 --> 01:23:07,142
"slowly, a sea of sorrow..."

745
01:23:07,515 --> 01:23:10,507
"rose, stilled in her eyes"

746
01:23:11,052 --> 01:23:13,816
To lilting lutes...

747
01:23:14,422 --> 01:23:20,224
her eyes told the tale

748
01:23:25,934 --> 01:23:28,596
"Always, it was you I loved..."

749
01:23:28,870 --> 01:23:31,634
and I loved and I loved...

750
01:23:31,873 --> 01:23:35,240
and I loved forever

751
01:23:41,383 --> 01:23:47,845
"Forever I have longed for you
as I have longed for nothing else"

752
01:23:51,292 --> 01:23:54,056
My heart has worshipped you...

753
01:23:54,796 --> 01:23:57,526
worshipped you and worshipped...

754
01:23:57,999 --> 01:24:01,196
and worshipped but none else

755
01:24:02,837 --> 01:24:05,601
Never...

756
01:24:06,007 --> 01:24:10,808
"never, never, never..."

757
01:24:11,012 --> 01:24:12,980
and none else

758
01:24:57,125 --> 01:25:00,253
sorrow clouds a joy...

759
01:25:00,829 --> 01:25:03,730
shades of anguish darken her...

760
01:25:03,932 --> 01:25:06,958
as she goes to tell her beloved...

761
01:25:07,235 --> 01:25:10,534
only to tell her beloved

762
01:25:13,775 --> 01:25:19,805
The wound you have left me with...

763
01:25:21,082 --> 01:25:26,816
only adds to my beauty

764
01:25:27,589 --> 01:25:33,858
"My wound I will preserve
as your mark..."

765
01:25:34,195 --> 01:25:40,623
that anoints my forehead

766
01:25:41,035 --> 01:25:42,696
My beloved...

767
01:25:42,871 --> 01:25:44,338
oh beloved...

768
01:25:44,472 --> 01:25:46,440
without you...

769
01:25:46,674 --> 01:25:48,642
my life is incomplete...

770
01:25:48,877 --> 01:25:50,674
vacuous...

771
01:25:50,879 --> 01:25:52,676
empty...

772
01:25:53,982 --> 01:25:56,212
my life is empty...

773
01:26:08,997 --> 01:26:12,330
"Carrying memories
of moments past..."

774
01:26:12,567 --> 01:26:15,661
"with burdened steps
she walks..."

775
01:26:15,837 --> 01:26:18,635
her heart cries...

776
01:26:18,907 --> 01:26:21,842
her eyes weep...

777
01:26:22,210 --> 01:26:25,543
her heart...

778
01:26:25,847 --> 01:26:28,315
resonates

779
01:26:29,384 --> 01:26:32,217
Childhood memories...

780
01:26:36,191 --> 01:26:38,523
of relationships...

781
01:26:38,726 --> 01:26:41,820
swinging in the rain...

782
01:26:42,964 --> 01:26:44,431
smiling...

783
01:26:44,599 --> 01:26:46,226
drawing laughter...

784
01:26:46,367 --> 01:26:49,268
"annoyed, being placated"

785
01:26:49,604 --> 01:26:52,630
Every moment...

786
01:26:52,974 --> 01:26:54,942
etched into my heart...

787
01:26:55,076 --> 01:26:56,873
in the flames of my lamp...

788
01:26:57,078 --> 01:27:03,176
I am carrying...

789
01:27:03,551 --> 01:27:06,884
away

790
01:27:07,055 --> 01:27:09,888
My beloved...

791
01:27:10,225 --> 01:27:11,886
without you...

792
01:27:11,993 --> 01:27:17,898
my life is nothing...

793
01:27:19,901 --> 01:27:22,165
nothing at all

794
01:27:27,909 --> 01:27:30,707
"Always, you I loved..."

795
01:27:30,912 --> 01:27:32,880
and I loved and I loved...

796
01:27:33,014 --> 01:27:34,675
and I loved forever

797
01:27:38,253 --> 01:27:41,586
"I loved, loved, loved"

798
01:27:44,926 --> 01:27:48,327
"You, I loved and loved"

799
01:27:51,766 --> 01:27:54,826
I loved and loved

800
01:27:58,873 --> 01:28:02,206
Only loved and loved and loved

801
01:28:27,402 --> 01:28:31,702
Deva! Open up!
What are you doing?

802
01:28:32,106 --> 01:28:36,440
Open up! What madness is this?
- For my sake! Open up

803
01:28:36,711 --> 01:28:40,670
I said it! Don't tear Deva and Paro
apart! But who listens to me?

804
01:28:40,982 --> 01:28:43,644
What's going on?
- Look! Tell him something

805
01:28:43,918 --> 01:28:47,877
"Narayan, tell him.
- No point. Leave him alone"

806
01:28:48,323 --> 01:28:50,917
The fire will die down on its own.
- But look...

807
01:29:00,568 --> 01:29:03,230
Time plays games with everyone

808
01:29:04,872 --> 01:29:08,535
My daughter treads upon silver now!
But look...

809
01:29:08,943 --> 01:29:12,538
Iook at your son. It's your pride
that he sets afire

810
01:29:13,314 --> 01:29:15,544
Two acts to the melodrama!

811
01:29:16,284 --> 01:29:18,878
In Act One
my daughter and I danced

812
01:29:19,887 --> 01:29:23,482
Act Two
Now you and your son will dance

813
01:29:49,384 --> 01:29:52,182
Why is the new bride so dejected?
- Because last night...

814
01:29:52,286 --> 01:29:55,653
husband and bride slept apart.
- That's for the first night

815
01:29:55,857 --> 01:29:57,848
It's said to be ominous.
But it's over

816
01:29:58,025 --> 01:30:00,653
"From tonight, man and wife
will sleep together"

817
01:30:03,131 --> 01:30:05,122
Are you harassing the bride?

818
01:30:05,333 --> 01:30:07,324
Sit...
sit Parvati

819
01:30:07,935 --> 01:30:14,033
"You know, we had everything here,
but the Moon. And now you're here"

820
01:30:16,577 --> 01:30:18,875
Now you are
the lady of the manor

821
01:30:19,247 --> 01:30:21,238
Also a mother
to these children

822
01:30:23,418 --> 01:30:25,682
"From his first wife,
Bhuvan has three children"

823
01:30:26,020 --> 01:30:29,888
"Your son, Mahendra.
- Obeisances, Chhoti-Ma"

824
01:30:30,925 --> 01:30:34,884
"And our youngest, little Kalika.
- My obeisances, Chhoti-Ma"

825
01:30:35,530 --> 01:30:37,521
"And Yashomati, the eldest"

826
01:30:38,199 --> 01:30:42,465
she's angry. You must placate her

827
01:30:43,037 --> 01:30:44,800
And all of you...

828
01:30:44,906 --> 01:30:47,704
you must adorn
the bride exquisitely...

829
01:30:48,042 --> 01:30:50,306
for her nuptial night

830
01:30:54,649 --> 01:30:56,640
Have you familiarised yourself
with the manor?

831
01:30:56,851 --> 01:31:00,582
"Yes.
- You have my word, Parvati..."

832
01:31:00,922 --> 01:31:04,449
"in this manor, you will have
no problems about anything"

833
01:31:04,992 --> 01:31:07,187
Except one

834
01:31:07,728 --> 01:31:11,858
It is difficult to bide time here.
- Oh but time flies here

835
01:31:12,300 --> 01:31:18,864
I do not understand...?
- A while ago I was a new bride

836
01:31:19,774 --> 01:31:22,538
"And in no time, I'm Chhoti-Ma
(Chhoti-Ma: Little Mother)"

837
01:31:22,944 --> 01:31:27,278
"From bride to "little Mother",
I'm transformed. In no time"

838
01:31:27,648 --> 01:31:32,347
I wish to tell you something.
I married because my Ma insisted

839
01:31:33,321 --> 01:31:37,621
"My children needed a mother,
and this manor needs a lady"

840
01:31:39,227 --> 01:31:41,218
And you...?

841
01:31:43,898 --> 01:31:47,425
Subhadra... was my first wife

842
01:31:48,903 --> 01:31:52,168
"You're now the lady of the manor,
the mother of my children..."

843
01:31:52,907 --> 01:31:57,844
"and my new bride, no doubt.
But subhadra, I can never forget"

844
01:31:58,846 --> 01:32:04,182
"The ominous first night may be over.
But we will stay distanced, forever"

845
01:32:05,319 --> 01:32:09,517
"My mistake or my sin,
call it what you may..."

846
01:32:10,024 --> 01:32:12,015
but do forgive me

847
01:32:27,575 --> 01:32:31,272
"Good morning friend, good morning.
You're lucky, my friend"

848
01:32:31,679 --> 01:32:34,546
I ask help of the spirits
to knock me out of my senses

849
01:32:34,782 --> 01:32:38,684
You won't even touch the spirits
and yet you are inebriated?

850
01:32:39,420 --> 01:32:46,383
You missed telling me? Or made
a pariah of me? Paro and paramour

851
01:32:48,095 --> 01:32:50,893
"Both spelt with "p"! Your stupor
has unravelled all your secrets"

852
01:32:52,333 --> 01:32:54,267
Who brought me here?

853
01:32:54,835 --> 01:33:00,831
"My lover
is so faithless"

854
01:33:02,543 --> 01:33:07,242
"How regrettable, to be rescued
off the streets by a prostitute"

855
01:33:09,917 --> 01:33:15,583
This one is an ingrate Chuni Babu!
Bites me for the love I gave him

856
01:33:15,856 --> 01:33:20,259
My word! She helped you out of
humane concern. You were sick

857
01:33:20,428 --> 01:33:25,263
"she picked you up from the streets.
You've come to, after two days"

858
01:33:25,866 --> 01:33:30,860
"she never slept a wink, nursed you,
sat through your cries for Paro"

859
01:33:31,572 --> 01:33:34,439
Insult instead of gratitude?

860
01:33:34,675 --> 01:33:41,547
Let it pass. It's a landlord trait.
Never mind their little trespasses

861
01:33:43,050 --> 01:33:47,885
"You left as if, forever.
But as luck would have it..."

862
01:33:48,022 --> 01:33:51,287
I find you once again.
Medicine...

863
01:33:52,226 --> 01:33:54,626
you need it. Now

864
01:33:56,897 --> 01:34:00,424
"Your medicine, I don't need.
I'd rather have lain there"

865
01:34:00,835 --> 01:34:06,239
Just fall unconscious once again.
I'll dump you where I found you

866
01:34:06,507 --> 01:34:08,498
Yes Chuni Babu?

867
01:34:13,180 --> 01:34:14,841
What is this?
- Chuni Babu says...

868
01:34:15,249 --> 01:34:19,515
you've been here for two nights.
Lamps in your boudoir went unlit

869
01:34:20,321 --> 01:34:23,654
This is price. For two nights
you wasted on me

870
01:34:28,863 --> 01:34:32,663
"Now I know,
why Paro abandoned you"

871
01:34:33,868 --> 01:34:37,531
"Let alone love,
you don't even deserve sympathy"

872
01:34:38,339 --> 01:34:42,673
Hear Chuni Babu?
A courtesan talking of romance

873
01:34:43,878 --> 01:34:49,043
"Am I to learn of her what love is,
what romance be? What is amour?"

874
01:34:49,350 --> 01:34:55,152
"Love mirrored in your soul, amour
God's gift to life's design, romance"

875
01:34:57,925 --> 01:35:03,022
How regrettable Chuni Babu
Your friend possesses none...

876
01:35:03,364 --> 01:35:06,424
"of soul, or intent or purpose"

877
01:35:07,101 --> 01:35:10,832
That thing you flash
time and again Dev Babu...

878
01:35:11,639 --> 01:35:14,369
"the money, it lies at the feet
of harlots in brothels"

879
01:35:15,209 --> 01:35:20,841
"If you be so vain, return to me
what I spent on you"

880
01:35:21,916 --> 01:35:23,577
Two nights

881
01:35:23,851 --> 01:35:28,652
"You owe me 2 nights, Dev Babu.
No more shall I dance..."

882
01:35:28,856 --> 01:35:33,850
not until you come.
These eyes will await you

883
01:35:37,898 --> 01:35:44,861
"F for friendship, she came seeking,
you found a foe. You owe two nights"

884
01:35:47,007 --> 01:35:50,204
O'faithless lover
