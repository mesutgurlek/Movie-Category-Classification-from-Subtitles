0
00:00:21,360 --> 00:00:25,273
- Keep 'em comin'!
- This ammo's getting heavier.

1
00:00:25,360 --> 00:00:29,399
- I'm gonna hand in my resignation.
- It's a steady job, isn't it?

2
00:00:29,480 --> 00:00:33,109
Room and board, fresh air,
good hours. What else you want?

3
00:00:33,200 --> 00:00:36,033
- Only one more month.
- Wish I was out already.

4
00:00:36,120 --> 00:00:39,590
Drop that shell
and we'll all be out. Way out!

5
00:00:39,680 --> 00:00:41,750
Not bad,
the first tank crew on the moon!

6
00:00:41,840 --> 00:00:45,515
Let's snap it up,
we move out at 0500.

7
00:02:08,840 --> 00:02:11,798
1-6, this is 1-1,
I am in position, out.

8
00:02:11,880 --> 00:02:14,599
Driver, stop! Gunner, HE.

9
00:02:17,360 --> 00:02:19,191
- Fire!
- On the way!

10
00:02:20,280 --> 00:02:21,838
Cease fire.

11
00:02:25,040 --> 00:02:26,792
Fire!

12
00:02:36,120 --> 00:02:38,839
Driver, stop. Gunner, HE.

13
00:02:40,200 --> 00:02:44,159
Over, right 2-0. Drop 200!

14
00:02:46,040 --> 00:02:48,952
- White shack.
- Identified.

15
00:02:49,040 --> 00:02:50,917
- Fire!
- On the way!

16
00:02:54,440 --> 00:02:58,638
- Just like it had eyes.
- You should see me with a slingshot.

17
00:02:59,520 --> 00:03:03,513
Driver, back to base.
Charlie-poppin'.

18
00:03:03,600 --> 00:03:07,673
- Roger.
- Home, James, and through the park.

19
00:03:21,760 --> 00:03:24,115
Sarge, anything new on Frankfurt?

20
00:03:24,200 --> 00:03:28,352
We transfer there tomorrow.
It's our last night, get me a date!

21
00:03:28,440 --> 00:03:32,592
- Blonde, brunette or redhead?
- Bald, as long as she wiggles.

22
00:03:32,680 --> 00:03:34,636
You know it!

23
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:45,231
Jeeter, orders just came in,
I gotta talk to Cookie.

24
00:03:45,320 --> 00:03:47,629
I'll see if he's at the field CP.

25
00:03:48,920 --> 00:03:51,559
Pretty Boy 5,
this is Pretty Boy 1-1.

26
00:03:51,640 --> 00:03:55,599
- This is Pretty Boy 5, over.
- This you, Cookie?

27
00:03:55,680 --> 00:03:57,750
- What's up, pal?
- Frankfurt.

28
00:03:57,840 --> 00:04:00,400
Ain't it great? I just heard. Direct.

29
00:04:00,480 --> 00:04:02,675
It changes our plans for tonight.

30
00:04:02,760 --> 00:04:06,594
Have to cancel out
the Ratskeller, I got other plans.

31
00:04:06,680 --> 00:04:10,116
Cancel out? We were gonna
break in some new numbers!

32
00:04:10,200 --> 00:04:13,988
Sorry, but there are some cute
numbers I have to break off with.

33
00:04:14,080 --> 00:04:16,150
I have to say goodbye.

34
00:04:16,240 --> 00:04:20,791
You finally get Müller to
put us on, and then wave bye-bye!

35
00:04:20,880 --> 00:04:22,632
I didn't mention waving.

36
00:04:22,720 --> 00:04:26,269
Cookie's right, Tulse.
Our careers come first.

37
00:04:26,360 --> 00:04:29,557
You win, I'll do my playing,
but only until 10.

38
00:04:29,640 --> 00:04:33,155
Talking of Frankfurt,
I picked up some hot news.

39
00:04:33,240 --> 00:04:37,438
- Get this. Marla's there.
- Marla?! In Frankfurt?

40
00:04:38,160 --> 00:04:39,912
Did you hear what I just heard?

41
00:04:42,440 --> 00:04:45,796
- Do I hear thunder?
- Are you blind?!

42
00:04:45,880 --> 00:04:47,836
Blind? He hit it, didn't he?

43
00:04:51,880 --> 00:04:56,271
- Aren't we lucky?
- What luck! What are we gonna do?

44
00:04:57,760 --> 00:04:59,512
Here comes trouble.

45
00:05:07,680 --> 00:05:12,435
OK, OK, chattering on the radio
and a thrown track! What happened?

46
00:05:12,520 --> 00:05:16,035
- Sorry, Sarge. My fault.
- You're the driver, ain't ya?

47
00:05:16,120 --> 00:05:19,192
He said sorry.
Can't this army take an apology?

48
00:05:19,280 --> 00:05:22,909
He threw a track, Sarge. Tough job.

49
00:05:23,000 --> 00:05:26,276
Shut up.
Should I call the Automobile Club?

50
00:05:26,360 --> 00:05:31,036
- Would you do that, Sarge?
- Don't just stand there. Fix it!

51
00:05:31,200 --> 00:05:33,509
The whole crew stays till it's done.

52
00:05:33,600 --> 00:05:37,559
Sarge, that'll make it pretty tough
to fix that date for you.

53
00:05:37,640 --> 00:05:40,996
- Yeah. Ride with me, Dynamite.
- Wait a minute!

54
00:05:41,080 --> 00:05:43,674
Somebody has to make out the report.

55
00:05:43,760 --> 00:05:46,274
"Somebody has to make out
the report."

56
00:05:55,400 --> 00:05:57,152
Goodbye!

57
00:05:58,000 --> 00:06:00,355
Dames is money in this army, Tulsa.

58
00:06:00,440 --> 00:06:03,159
- Don't look at me, I'm broke.
- I'd like to be as broke as you.

59
00:06:23,400 --> 00:06:27,439
Cookie! You know,
I was on that tank for four hours.

60
00:06:27,520 --> 00:06:29,909
Next time
I'm putting in for General.

61
00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:32,719
Not me,
you're looking at a born civilian.

62
00:06:33,960 --> 00:06:36,679
When am I gonna get
that 300 you guys owe me?

63
00:06:36,760 --> 00:06:39,672
Every day
it's the same question, Sarge!

64
00:06:39,760 --> 00:06:43,878
I just don't happen
to have it on me. No pockets.

65
00:06:45,560 --> 00:06:49,599
- Somebody grab my soap?
- I think we had it for breakfast.

66
00:06:49,680 --> 00:06:53,434
Where's my soap?! Throw me my soap!

67
00:06:54,080 --> 00:06:55,957
All right, all right...

68
00:07:24,200 --> 00:07:26,236
- Tulsa!
- Hiya, Lizzie.

69
00:07:26,320 --> 00:07:29,710
I borrowed my uncle's car.
We go for a ride later?

70
00:07:29,800 --> 00:07:31,870
Sorry, we gotta play tonight.

71
00:07:33,800 --> 00:07:36,268
You don't understand,
I mean here.

72
00:07:36,360 --> 00:07:40,592
- But I have the car.
- Maybe after we're finished.

73
00:07:41,880 --> 00:07:44,189
Keep your motor running, honey.

74
00:07:46,280 --> 00:07:49,636
You're in for a treat, Sarge.
We're playing here tonight.

75
00:07:49,720 --> 00:07:53,679
- Just look at that shape.
- It ain't my type. Where's Dynamite?

76
00:07:53,760 --> 00:07:56,638
- Hey, Sarge.
- I see you got your pockets on.

77
00:07:56,720 --> 00:08:00,269
The geld. I'll take
any part of that 300 bucks.

78
00:08:00,360 --> 00:08:02,555
Sarge, you've been very patient,

79
00:08:02,640 --> 00:08:05,598
so whatever we get tonight,
you get half, OK?

80
00:08:05,680 --> 00:08:07,352
I'll be waiting.

81
00:08:07,440 --> 00:08:10,432
- Here's Papa Müller.
- Bye, Sarge.

82
00:08:10,520 --> 00:08:14,229
- Hi, Papa Müller. We're here.
- Ready for the audition.

83
00:08:14,320 --> 00:08:17,278
Boys, I did not say yes,
I did not say no.

84
00:08:17,360 --> 00:08:20,352
- You said "maybe".
- The "maybe" is now "no".

85
00:08:20,440 --> 00:08:22,396
I can't take a chance with beginners.

86
00:08:22,480 --> 00:08:26,439
But I've told you we're the hottest
combo this side of the Rhine.

87
00:08:27,480 --> 00:08:29,357
This could make you famous.

88
00:08:29,440 --> 00:08:33,399
You could discover The Three Blazes.
And you don't have to pay us much.

89
00:08:33,480 --> 00:08:35,914
- I can afford nothing.
- We'll take it.

90
00:08:36,000 --> 00:08:38,195
- What is this?
- We need practice.

91
00:08:38,280 --> 00:08:41,033
If the price is nothing,
I take the chance.

92
00:08:41,120 --> 00:08:44,271
- Ain't we working kinda cheap?
- Think on the bright side.

93
00:08:44,360 --> 00:08:48,911
If we get nothing,
all McGraw gets is half of nothing.

94
00:09:35,680 --> 00:09:39,832
Hiya, Sarge.
We got one of each. Take your pick.

95
00:09:40,520 --> 00:09:44,433
- At ease.
- Red's my favourite colour.

96
00:09:47,600 --> 00:09:50,717
Right, girls,
let's get a drink at the bar.

97
00:09:56,400 --> 00:09:58,470
- Your name?
- Britta.

98
00:11:02,600 --> 00:11:04,477
You're with me.

99
00:12:43,200 --> 00:12:45,668
Look! Papa wants
to give us some money.

100
00:12:47,880 --> 00:12:51,839
We just lost our amateur standing.
Keep playing. I'll be right back.

101
00:12:53,000 --> 00:12:56,231
- You boys were very good.
- Thanks.

102
00:12:56,640 --> 00:13:00,474
This is gonna help us get
our own nightclub back in America.

103
00:13:00,560 --> 00:13:04,439
As long as it is in America.
Please, no competition.

104
00:13:04,880 --> 00:13:06,836
- Good luck.
- Thanks, Papa.

105
00:13:07,920 --> 00:13:09,956
20 marks, that's 10 bucks.

106
00:13:10,040 --> 00:13:15,194
- 10 bucks added to 290 makes...
- My 300.

107
00:13:15,280 --> 00:13:17,475
- Wait a minute, Sarge.
- Why?

108
00:13:19,360 --> 00:13:24,514
Sure, Sarge. I just wanted to thank
you. There's every penny we owe you.

109
00:13:25,400 --> 00:13:29,109
Sarge, seeing that
you did us such a big favour

110
00:13:29,200 --> 00:13:33,716
by lending us the money to buy
the instruments and get started,

111
00:13:33,800 --> 00:13:36,917
I am now gonna do you a big favour.

112
00:13:38,400 --> 00:13:42,996
- What's this?
- It used to be a chilli parlour,

113
00:13:43,080 --> 00:13:47,517
but we're turning it into
the hottest night spot in Oklahoma.

114
00:13:48,240 --> 00:13:50,834
That's the lease.
Ricky, Cookie and me,

115
00:13:50,920 --> 00:13:53,878
we're opening it up
as soon as we get out of the service.

116
00:13:53,960 --> 00:13:57,873
And Sarge,
we wanna make you a partner.

117
00:13:57,960 --> 00:14:01,635
- Why?
- Well, you're a regular fella

118
00:14:01,720 --> 00:14:05,474
and why shouldn't you be
a partner in our nightclub?

119
00:14:05,560 --> 00:14:08,870
- A nightclub with dames?
- A whole chorus line.

120
00:14:08,960 --> 00:14:12,589
- You can pick and rehearse 'em.
- And rehearse 'em...

121
00:14:14,640 --> 00:14:18,633
This will pay for your share
of the lease. See you later, partner.

122
00:16:32,880 --> 00:16:37,556
- What are you doing? He's singing!
- So? I wanna hear an original.

123
00:16:38,400 --> 00:16:40,914
- Turn that thing off!
- Turn Tulse off!

124
00:16:41,000 --> 00:16:43,753
- I'll turn it off.
- Don't, Jeeter.

125
00:17:01,640 --> 00:17:03,596
Women and children first!

126
00:17:16,800 --> 00:17:19,234
MPs! Come on, Tulsa!

127
00:17:19,320 --> 00:17:21,390
Come on, let's get out of here!

128
00:17:30,840 --> 00:17:33,912
Papa, this'll take care
of the broken glasses.

129
00:17:40,320 --> 00:17:41,833
Sorry, Papa.

130
00:18:04,560 --> 00:18:09,156
Sarge, you're making a smart move.
Your signature on that paper

131
00:18:09,240 --> 00:18:12,073
makes you a full-fledged
partner of the nightclub.

132
00:18:12,160 --> 00:18:14,116
Hope I'm not making a mistake.

133
00:18:15,040 --> 00:18:18,350
- I almost forgot. We need 300 bucks.
- 300?!

134
00:18:18,440 --> 00:18:22,433
- A cheque'll do.
- You got 300 off me last night!

135
00:18:22,520 --> 00:18:25,876
I'll try to explain.
Signing the lease is just part of it.

136
00:18:25,960 --> 00:18:28,554
We need 600,
and you being our treasurer...

137
00:18:28,640 --> 00:18:32,679
- I resign. Give me my dough back.
- Partners shouldn't quarrel.

138
00:18:34,280 --> 00:18:36,236
What's that? Comin', Joe!

139
00:18:37,840 --> 00:18:39,796
I didn't hear nothin'.

140
00:19:02,920 --> 00:19:05,229
- See you later.
- Where you goin', Rick?

141
00:19:05,720 --> 00:19:10,475
- Buttonhole the guy who saw Marla.
- Can I throw you a few leads?

142
00:19:10,880 --> 00:19:14,031
You know I don't bother
with used phone numbers.

143
00:19:17,080 --> 00:19:19,036
Did McGraw sign the lease?

144
00:19:19,120 --> 00:19:22,396
He signed, but he wouldn't
come up with that dough.

145
00:19:22,480 --> 00:19:25,677
Then what good is it?
We need 600. We only got three.

146
00:19:25,760 --> 00:19:27,113
I know.

147
00:19:32,680 --> 00:19:35,035
How are the fräuleins in Frankfurt?

148
00:19:35,120 --> 00:19:38,112
Great for me,
which makes it kinda tough on you.

149
00:19:38,200 --> 00:19:41,670
I'll take my chances.
I followed you in Hawaii, didn't I?

150
00:19:41,760 --> 00:19:44,752
And I wound up with
12 hula skirts in my foot locker.

151
00:19:44,840 --> 00:19:47,832
Dynamite batted 1,000, almost.

152
00:19:47,920 --> 00:19:50,992
That "almost" separates the men
from the boys.

153
00:19:51,080 --> 00:19:53,992
And every time you went to bat
you stole home?

154
00:19:54,080 --> 00:19:57,231
Turk was knocked out once.
Just once, huh, Turk?

155
00:19:57,320 --> 00:19:59,470
- You mean Lili?
- Yeah...

156
00:19:59,560 --> 00:20:02,791
- She don't count.
- Who's this Lili?

157
00:20:02,880 --> 00:20:04,836
A dancer in the Café Europa.

158
00:20:04,920 --> 00:20:10,392
There ain't a GI in the division
can date her. She's a real fooler.

159
00:20:10,480 --> 00:20:13,995
Steam heat outside, iceberg inside.

160
00:20:14,080 --> 00:20:18,358
Yeah? I got 50 bucks
that says I can defrost her.

161
00:20:18,440 --> 00:20:20,749
And I got 50 I'd like to double.

162
00:20:22,320 --> 00:20:25,790
I got Lili to the door.
See if you can make it inside,

163
00:20:25,880 --> 00:20:28,440
and stay around a few hours,
till dawn.

164
00:20:29,320 --> 00:20:31,276
Give me three days.

165
00:20:31,360 --> 00:20:34,636
- I'll give you a week.
- That's a bet.

166
00:20:34,720 --> 00:20:36,551
- 10 on Dynamite.
- 20.

167
00:20:36,640 --> 00:20:38,835
- I got 50.
- I got 25!

168
00:20:40,640 --> 00:20:42,835
- I got 300 on Dynamite!
- 300?!

169
00:20:42,920 --> 00:20:45,559
- Anybody gonna cover it?
- Yeah, sure!

170
00:20:45,640 --> 00:20:48,916
Wait a minute,
I wanna piece of that. 50 bucks.

171
00:20:49,000 --> 00:20:52,037
- You're with us.
- But I'm betting against you.

172
00:20:52,120 --> 00:20:54,588
- I'll watch out for you.
- Hold the stakes.

173
00:20:54,680 --> 00:20:56,989
- OK, come on.
- Spell my name right!

174
00:20:58,240 --> 00:21:01,357
Hi, Padre!

175
00:21:01,440 --> 00:21:04,955
Just getting the names
of some art galleries in Frankfurt.

176
00:21:05,040 --> 00:21:09,670
Of course, of course. The Café
Europa has some wonderful paintings.

177
00:21:11,520 --> 00:21:13,476
All right, men, on the double!

178
00:21:13,560 --> 00:21:16,233
Briefing from Captain Hobart.
Move out!

179
00:21:16,320 --> 00:21:18,470
Come on, give me that!

180
00:21:24,520 --> 00:21:26,636
Company...halt!

181
00:21:27,720 --> 00:21:29,676
Right face!

182
00:21:30,600 --> 00:21:32,830
At ease. This won't take long.

183
00:21:33,920 --> 00:21:38,311
As you men realise, you are American
ambassadors to West Germany.

184
00:21:38,400 --> 00:21:42,837
Your conduct during your tour of duty
is of the greatest importance.

185
00:21:42,920 --> 00:21:47,118
There should be no black sheep,
which regretfully is not the case.

186
00:21:47,200 --> 00:21:52,115
Sergeant Bixby. You're a good soldier
in every respect but one.

187
00:21:52,200 --> 00:21:56,591
- German fathers are complaining.
- I don't know any German fathers.

188
00:21:56,680 --> 00:22:00,036
Might be better if you did.
We put our heads together

189
00:22:00,120 --> 00:22:02,350
and we decided to ship you to Alaska.

190
00:22:02,440 --> 00:22:04,954
- Captain, you can't do that!
- Who said that?

191
00:22:06,040 --> 00:22:11,592
You take off at 1000 hours.
Fall into a train at 0950. Questions?

192
00:22:11,680 --> 00:22:14,956
Company...attention!

193
00:22:15,280 --> 00:22:17,236
Dismiss your platoons.

194
00:22:18,240 --> 00:22:20,196
Dismissed.

195
00:22:20,280 --> 00:22:22,874
You better see
what you can do with Turk.

196
00:22:33,120 --> 00:22:35,953
Would you like some sugar
with your coffee?

197
00:22:36,040 --> 00:22:38,793
- Two lumps.
- Gladly. Gladly.

198
00:22:40,680 --> 00:22:44,389
Turk, all we want is a fair shake.
That's all.

199
00:22:44,480 --> 00:22:48,439
It's not our fault that Dynamite's
being shipped to Alaska.

200
00:22:48,520 --> 00:22:52,433
- What do you say?
- OK, I'll give you a fair shake.

201
00:22:52,520 --> 00:22:55,159
- Thanks.
- Any of your outfit can try Lili.

202
00:22:55,240 --> 00:22:57,435
- Quit kidding.
- Cookie, we're going!

203
00:22:57,520 --> 00:22:59,476
- My gear!
- It's on board!

204
00:22:59,560 --> 00:23:02,438
- What do you say? The bet's off?
- The bet's on!

205
00:23:02,520 --> 00:23:04,636
Good luck! You're gonna need it!

206
00:23:14,480 --> 00:23:16,755
You've gotta help, we're in a spot.

207
00:23:16,840 --> 00:23:21,470
Look, you guys, with me romancing
a girl is a hobby, not a business.

208
00:23:21,560 --> 00:23:24,233
If I'm romantic
I can't think about money.

209
00:23:24,320 --> 00:23:27,949
- OK, who's second on the list?
- Jeeter.

210
00:23:28,040 --> 00:23:31,476
He's been married six times.
Somebody must have liked him.

211
00:23:31,560 --> 00:23:34,518
Maybe there's still a spark left.
I'll ask him.

212
00:23:37,720 --> 00:23:42,475
300 bucks down the drain. I'm in real
trouble with the Sarge this time.

213
00:23:42,560 --> 00:23:44,516
You're not the only one in a jam.

214
00:23:44,600 --> 00:23:48,275
There's Rick and me, our nightclub
in Oklahoma, everything.

215
00:23:48,360 --> 00:23:50,430
You just blew The Three Blazes.

216
00:23:50,520 --> 00:23:53,478
- I guess I did.
- I knew you wouldn't let us down!

217
00:23:53,560 --> 00:23:58,076
- I can't take Dynamite's place!
- You're modest. That's what we need!

218
00:23:58,160 --> 00:24:02,551
An unassuming, gentleman-type
fellow to get his foot in a door!

219
00:24:02,640 --> 00:24:05,916
- Quick, take over! Hey, fellas!
- Look out, Cookie.

220
00:24:06,000 --> 00:24:09,595
- I found out where Marla's working.
- Good. You're in business.

221
00:24:09,680 --> 00:24:11,636
Looks like we both are.

222
00:24:13,480 --> 00:24:15,436
Tulsa's gonna take Dynamite's place!

223
00:27:15,400 --> 00:27:17,789
What a welcome. Nothing.

224
00:27:24,040 --> 00:27:25,996
Who and what are you waving at?

225
00:27:26,080 --> 00:27:29,675
What have I got to lose?
Somebody might wave back.

226
00:27:53,880 --> 00:27:57,589
I was saving this for my wedding,
but this is more important.

227
00:27:57,680 --> 00:28:01,753
If I'm gonna do this,
don't put that smelly stuff on me.

228
00:28:02,840 --> 00:28:06,753
- Any luck with Marla?
- I gotta go there before closing.

229
00:28:06,840 --> 00:28:08,876
- Good luck.
- Good luck!

230
00:28:10,560 --> 00:28:13,120
How you gonna
break the ice with this gal?

231
00:28:13,200 --> 00:28:18,320
Charm, boy. Charm. I walk up to her
and say, "All my life, Lili,

232
00:28:18,400 --> 00:28:21,517
"I been hoping to meet
a gorgeous babe like you.

233
00:28:21,600 --> 00:28:25,149
- "Let's go to your apartment."
- No, no, be more subtle.

234
00:28:25,240 --> 00:28:27,435
Yeah? How's this: "Little girl,

235
00:28:27,520 --> 00:28:31,433
"I'm not one of those GI wolves
that hang around nightclubs.

236
00:28:31,520 --> 00:28:34,114
"Give me a key
and I'll meet you at home."

237
00:28:34,200 --> 00:28:36,839
- That's subtle!
- He's kidding, Harvey.

238
00:28:36,920 --> 00:28:40,708
Relax, guys, I'll play it my way.
Nice, clean, wholesome.

239
00:28:41,680 --> 00:28:43,955
Just don't get shook up. And look...

240
00:28:44,920 --> 00:28:47,957
I don't mind doing this
for you guys, for all of us,

241
00:28:48,040 --> 00:28:52,272
but don't try to help me, OK?
Let's go.

242
00:28:54,320 --> 00:28:56,231
Operation Lili!

243
00:29:08,280 --> 00:29:12,432
Oh, boy, oh, boy, oh, boy!
There she is, target for tonight.

244
00:29:12,520 --> 00:29:16,479
- Say something.
- You said it for all of us.

245
00:29:17,440 --> 00:29:19,715
Fellas! Come on, take a look!

246
00:32:50,840 --> 00:32:54,150
- Cools a guy off, don't she?
- This might be tough.

247
00:32:54,240 --> 00:32:57,073
Might not.
A strategy, that's what we need.

248
00:33:06,160 --> 00:33:09,072
Come to the manager's office,
we'll fix you.

249
00:33:09,160 --> 00:33:12,197
Wine for Mr Klugmann. On the house!

250
00:33:12,280 --> 00:33:15,192
I think I'll do
a little reconnaissance work.

251
00:33:15,280 --> 00:33:18,317
Spread out, fellas,
give me room, now, please.

252
00:33:20,880 --> 00:33:22,757
May I?

253
00:33:22,840 --> 00:33:25,149
- Yes, of course.
- Thanks.

254
00:33:26,760 --> 00:33:28,910
- Can I buy you a drink?
- No, thank you.

255
00:33:38,960 --> 00:33:43,238
Ladies and gentlemen, we have
a request from an American colonel

256
00:33:43,320 --> 00:33:46,118
to hear a song
from a soldier in his command.

257
00:33:46,200 --> 00:33:49,749
Will Specialist
Tulsa McLean please come up.

258
00:33:56,960 --> 00:34:00,430
Better sing, soldier.
Your loyal public is waiting.

259
00:34:00,520 --> 00:34:03,592
This might be the end
of a beautiful beginning.

260
00:34:07,520 --> 00:34:10,751
- I thought I told you not to help.
- What did I do?

261
00:34:10,840 --> 00:34:12,831
"What did I do?"

262
00:34:17,600 --> 00:34:21,991
Wait till you see this guy,
he's a buddy of mine. Tulsa McLean.

263
00:34:22,080 --> 00:34:25,629
Specialist Tulsa McLean.
Ring a bell?

264
00:34:25,720 --> 00:34:30,032
- I've never heard of the gentleman.
- You haven't heard of Tulsa?

265
00:36:16,400 --> 00:36:19,915
- He's not bad, your friend.
- You two oughtta get together.

266
00:36:20,000 --> 00:36:22,673
I mean, you're both entertainers.
Wait here. I'll get him.

267
00:36:24,720 --> 00:36:26,472
Wine!

268
00:36:34,720 --> 00:36:37,678
She flipped her lid about you.
She's waitin' for you.

269
00:36:37,760 --> 00:36:39,512
- Where?
- Come on!

270
00:36:40,880 --> 00:36:44,759
Where did Lili go? She wanted
to get together with my pal here.

271
00:36:44,840 --> 00:36:47,798
- I do not think so.
- She flipped over me?!

272
00:36:47,880 --> 00:36:50,440
I think she must have
flipped out of here.

273
00:36:53,960 --> 00:36:55,871
- Now what?
- You tell me.

274
00:36:55,960 --> 00:36:58,758
We just lost
the first round, that's all.

275
00:36:58,840 --> 00:37:01,400
You can get knocked out
in the first round.

276
00:37:01,480 --> 00:37:03,232
You wish a drink?

277
00:37:03,320 --> 00:37:05,356
- Arsenic on the rocks.
- Make that two.

278
00:37:06,960 --> 00:37:10,430
- Two beers.
- OK, two beers.

279
00:37:13,400 --> 00:37:15,550
Please, miss, be reasonable!

280
00:37:15,640 --> 00:37:18,791
If I nearly drowned
Herr Gluckman it is his fault.

281
00:37:18,880 --> 00:37:20,791
No, I will not apologise.

282
00:37:20,880 --> 00:37:25,396
All right, do not apologise,
but he is one of our best customers.

283
00:37:25,480 --> 00:37:28,597
Will it hurt to sit with him
and smile a little?

284
00:37:32,080 --> 00:37:36,676
Tell Herr Gluckman I am very sorry
but I am tired and I am going home.

285
00:37:36,760 --> 00:37:40,833
- He will not understand that.
- All right!

286
00:37:42,920 --> 00:37:47,436
Tell him I have a previous engagement
with two American soldiers.

287
00:37:47,520 --> 00:37:50,273
- You like anything else?
- You never know.

288
00:37:51,880 --> 00:37:56,112
Rome wasn't built in a day. With
her I'm glad they took their time.

289
00:37:56,200 --> 00:37:59,192
You said you were going
to introduce me to your friend.

290
00:37:59,280 --> 00:38:01,669
Yeah! Tulsa, Lili. Lili, Tulsa.

291
00:38:01,760 --> 00:38:04,399
- Would you like to join us?
- Yes, please.

292
00:38:04,480 --> 00:38:07,119
- Here you are, right here.
- Thank you.

293
00:38:07,200 --> 00:38:11,113
- You're fast.
- I've not seen you in here before.

294
00:38:11,200 --> 00:38:13,714
This is your first visit
to the Europa?

295
00:38:13,800 --> 00:38:16,678
- First time.
- Never been here before.

296
00:38:17,760 --> 00:38:19,671
Good breeding, fine manners.

297
00:38:19,760 --> 00:38:23,036
He could be a diplomat,
but he'd rather be a soldier.

298
00:38:23,120 --> 00:38:26,635
I enjoyed your song. That was
your work before you were a soldier?

299
00:38:26,720 --> 00:38:30,838
It might be after. With Cookie and
another buddy, we might open a club.

300
00:38:30,920 --> 00:38:33,514
Not that he has to
make a living. No, sir.

301
00:38:33,600 --> 00:38:37,070
He's not a spoiled playboy
like other oil millionaires.

302
00:38:37,160 --> 00:38:41,278
You'd never know he was sole heir
to 100,000 acres of Texas.

303
00:38:41,360 --> 00:38:44,113
- Look...
- Sorry, it slipped out.

304
00:38:44,200 --> 00:38:47,510
Tulsa wants to make it on his own.
Wouldn't take a nickel from his dad.

305
00:38:47,600 --> 00:38:50,831
- Shows character.
- Take a walk, Cookie.

306
00:38:50,920 --> 00:38:55,710
I better go before I spill the beans
about your grandfather's railroad.

307
00:39:01,720 --> 00:39:05,110
I do not like it here.
We shall go to some other place.

308
00:39:05,200 --> 00:39:09,318
Anything you say, honey.
You won't get into trouble leaving?

309
00:39:09,400 --> 00:39:13,279
I leave when I want to,
and I want to now.

310
00:39:17,800 --> 00:39:19,677
- Good night.
- Good night.

311
00:39:22,880 --> 00:39:24,711
Don't you wanna see how he does?

312
00:39:24,800 --> 00:39:28,793
Later. I got a little side bet
going on me. Get going.

313
00:39:31,280 --> 00:39:35,114
- Where we going tonight, honey?
- Don't call me "honey".

314
00:39:35,200 --> 00:39:38,272
- You didn't mind it inside.
- Now we're outside.

315
00:39:38,360 --> 00:39:41,193
But I got the idea
you and me kinda hit it off.

316
00:39:43,560 --> 00:39:46,233
You and Herr Gluckman
have much in common.

317
00:39:46,320 --> 00:39:48,754
- Wait a minute, honey...
- No "honey".

318
00:39:48,840 --> 00:39:53,197
- If we're going places tonight...
- We are not going anyplace.

319
00:39:53,280 --> 00:39:56,716
You helped me get rid
of Herr Gluckman. Thank you.

320
00:39:56,800 --> 00:40:01,191
- Now I'm going home, alone!
- But we got a date!

321
00:40:05,640 --> 00:40:08,950
A rich young Texas man
should be able to find a date.

322
00:40:09,040 --> 00:40:12,828
I'm not a rich young man.
"Son of an oil millionaire"!

323
00:40:12,920 --> 00:40:16,117
Closest I came to oil was draining
crank cases at a gas station.

324
00:40:16,200 --> 00:40:20,398
- And your grandfather's railroad?
- He was a brakeman in Texas.

325
00:40:22,000 --> 00:40:24,036
What's so funny?

326
00:40:24,120 --> 00:40:27,556
Come on, you poor millionaire.
I'll buy you a drink, honey.

327
00:40:29,360 --> 00:40:31,078
Let's go.

328
00:40:42,520 --> 00:40:45,876
When your friend mentioned
the 100,000 acres in Texas,

329
00:40:45,960 --> 00:40:50,875
- you should've seen your face.
- Now I know why I lose at poker.

330
00:40:52,680 --> 00:40:55,148
You should see that Tulse operate!

331
00:40:55,240 --> 00:40:57,834
- Nice to see you, Lili.
- Nice to see you.

332
00:40:57,920 --> 00:41:01,833
- It's not like your music.
- We play too slow?

333
00:41:01,920 --> 00:41:05,151
No, it's just that
we do it a little differently.

334
00:41:05,240 --> 00:41:07,674
But if it is too slow
it is dull.

335
00:41:07,760 --> 00:41:12,880
Not if you're with it. The rhythm
has to just sort of ooze out.

336
00:41:12,960 --> 00:41:18,478
- Was ist "ooze"?
- Show him "was ist ooze".

337
00:41:18,560 --> 00:41:22,599
- I show you "was ist ooze".
- Ja, ja. Ooze.

338
00:43:31,800 --> 00:43:33,756
"Das ist ooze."

339
00:43:35,320 --> 00:43:37,117
Very nice.

340
00:43:38,520 --> 00:43:42,399
- Shall we go someplace else?
- Yeah, let's do that.

341
00:43:46,760 --> 00:43:48,512
He's off and running!

342
00:43:56,960 --> 00:43:59,952
Turk had her this far
and got dumped in the stretch.

343
00:44:00,040 --> 00:44:01,996
It's on me.

344
00:44:06,760 --> 00:44:10,116
Let's go someplace where we can get
some food, and no music.

345
00:44:10,200 --> 00:44:12,156
I have an idea. We'll go home

346
00:44:12,240 --> 00:44:15,789
and I'll make a nice liederkranz
and pumpernickel and some coffee.

347
00:44:15,880 --> 00:44:17,996
Don't go to all that trouble.

348
00:44:18,080 --> 00:44:21,629
But it would be quiet,
and I'm very good at doing dishes...

349
00:44:21,720 --> 00:44:24,234
OK. Liederkranz, pumpernickel
and coffee.

350
00:44:24,320 --> 00:44:27,392
And for dessert,
some delicious apple strudel.

351
00:44:27,480 --> 00:44:29,357
You are hungry.

352
00:44:29,440 --> 00:44:31,635
I'm a growing boy, ma'am.
I'll get a cab.

353
00:44:31,720 --> 00:44:36,669
No, we'll walk. It's not far, and on
the way we'll get some apple strudel.

354
00:44:36,760 --> 00:44:41,231
- Thanks, ma'am.
- I don't like "ma'am".

355
00:44:41,480 --> 00:44:43,755
Neither do I, honey.

356
00:44:48,760 --> 00:44:51,957
You keep an eye on them,
I'll call Cookie.

357
00:44:59,320 --> 00:45:01,038
Café Europa, please.

358
00:45:02,800 --> 00:45:04,950
Talk louder! What's the latest?

359
00:45:05,040 --> 00:45:09,750
Breakthrough, he's walking her home!
She's gonna make him a sandwich.

360
00:45:09,840 --> 00:45:12,593
They're stopping
on the way for strudel.

361
00:45:12,680 --> 00:45:15,592
Good, a man can't do his best work
on an empty stomach.

362
00:45:17,280 --> 00:45:19,236
Three and a half hours to go.

363
00:45:19,320 --> 00:45:22,949
Better take small bites on that
liederkranz and pumpernickel.

364
00:45:23,040 --> 00:45:26,396
And you better leave word
at the barracks where she lives.

365
00:45:26,480 --> 00:45:28,835
I may be a little late.

366
00:45:36,440 --> 00:45:38,192
You look beautiful, Tina!

367
00:45:38,280 --> 00:45:40,919
No trouble with
the manager to let me off?

368
00:45:41,000 --> 00:45:44,788
No trouble. I told him
I was your cousin Angelo.

369
00:45:44,880 --> 00:45:47,348
- He believed you?
- Why shouldn't he?

370
00:45:47,440 --> 00:45:49,396
You believe me, don't you?

371
00:45:49,480 --> 00:45:53,393
Before we go to that night spot,
I want you to know something.

372
00:45:53,480 --> 00:45:56,711
- I'm not that kind of guy.
- What kind do you mean?

373
00:45:56,800 --> 00:46:00,509
The kind you think I am.
Smooth, tricky, a heartbreaker.

374
00:46:00,600 --> 00:46:03,068
- You got me all wrong.
- I believe you!

375
00:46:03,160 --> 00:46:06,277
They don't give Good Conduct
medals to just anybody.

376
00:46:13,000 --> 00:46:14,956
Taxi, bitte.

377
00:46:18,640 --> 00:46:22,553
Cookie, I think we have fun tonight.
I love going to nightclubs.

378
00:46:22,640 --> 00:46:25,996
- I can't stand 'em.
- Why were you at the Europa, then?

379
00:46:27,560 --> 00:46:31,997
I was Ionely, Tina.
A Ionely soldier, far from home.

380
00:46:32,400 --> 00:46:35,995
I'm far from home, too.
I come from Milano.

381
00:46:36,080 --> 00:46:40,596
Funny, isn't it? Here we are,
two Ionely people, far from home,

382
00:46:40,680 --> 00:46:44,116
neither one of us with a cosy
apartment to invite the other to

383
00:46:44,200 --> 00:46:46,156
where we could sit and read,

384
00:46:46,240 --> 00:46:49,118
and maybe listen to records
on the gramafunken.

385
00:46:49,200 --> 00:46:51,475
- I have an apartment!
- You have?

386
00:46:51,560 --> 00:46:55,269
- But no gramafunken.
- No gramafunken?

387
00:46:57,680 --> 00:47:01,195
Who needs a gramafunken,
we'll make our own music.

388
00:47:06,480 --> 00:47:08,835
Fräulein will give you the address.

389
00:47:11,520 --> 00:47:14,034
Tulsa, tell me more about Oklahoma.

390
00:47:14,120 --> 00:47:17,715
- You've heard everything.
- But it's so interesting.

391
00:47:17,800 --> 00:47:21,349
Your Indian grandmother,
she was a full-blooded Cherokee?

392
00:47:21,440 --> 00:47:26,468
She smoked a corncob pipe and played
a guitar. She taught me how.

393
00:47:26,560 --> 00:47:29,870
Strange, I thought
Indians only played tom-toms.

394
00:47:29,960 --> 00:47:33,794
That's just in the movies. Take
my Uncle Charlie, Leaping Bear.

395
00:47:33,880 --> 00:47:38,715
That's his real name. He plays
the best clarinet you'll ever hear.

396
00:47:38,800 --> 00:47:43,351
Yes, like in the movies. All Germans
are submarine commanders,

397
00:47:43,440 --> 00:47:45,829
and all French girls
are can-can dancers.

398
00:47:45,920 --> 00:47:48,832
Same thing.
That's the trouble with people.

399
00:47:48,920 --> 00:47:51,912
I mean, if people
got to know each other better

400
00:47:52,000 --> 00:47:55,470
then everything'd be
better all round.

401
00:47:55,560 --> 00:47:57,357
Much better.

402
00:48:10,840 --> 00:48:14,549
- You like my pizza?
- It's no wonder Nero got fat.

403
00:48:14,640 --> 00:48:17,279
I'm glad you like.
I'll make some more.

404
00:48:17,360 --> 00:48:22,150
- Not now. Let's talk a while.
- We talk...

405
00:48:22,240 --> 00:48:27,394
We talk about Park Avenue,
New York, where you come from.

406
00:48:27,480 --> 00:48:30,517
OK. What do you wanna know,
my little bambino?

407
00:48:30,600 --> 00:48:34,878
You make a mistake.
"Bambino" is a boy baby.

408
00:48:35,680 --> 00:48:39,309
That is a mistake.
Baby, you're no boy.

409
00:48:39,400 --> 00:48:43,029
To live in Park Avenue, New York,
one must be rich.

410
00:48:43,840 --> 00:48:45,990
Cookie, are you rich?

411
00:48:47,160 --> 00:48:49,549
Money isn't everything, Tina.

412
00:48:49,680 --> 00:48:54,708
Take me, for instance. Before I
decided to make the army my career,

413
00:48:54,800 --> 00:48:57,872
the only girls I ever met
were debutantes.

414
00:48:57,960 --> 00:49:01,316
Dull, artificial butterflies.
They could play tennis,

415
00:49:01,400 --> 00:49:05,234
ride and raise beagles,
but could they cook pizza?

416
00:49:05,320 --> 00:49:07,072
Not on your life!

417
00:49:07,160 --> 00:49:09,310
- I cannot raise a bagel.
- Beagle.

418
00:49:09,400 --> 00:49:13,837
That's what I said. But since
12 years old I can cook a pizza.

419
00:49:13,920 --> 00:49:15,672
Tina knows what a man likes.

420
00:49:15,760 --> 00:49:20,959
I could tell that as soon as I looked
at you. You're very understanding.

421
00:49:21,040 --> 00:49:24,999
You're a simple, understanding,
Italian, farm girl.

422
00:49:25,080 --> 00:49:28,550
I come from the city.
My father is a butcher.

423
00:49:28,640 --> 00:49:33,270
Better yet! A simple,
understanding, butcher's daughter.

424
00:49:41,720 --> 00:49:44,518
- I respect you.
- And I respect you.

425
00:49:44,600 --> 00:49:49,196
And that's what makes
the world go round. Respect...

426
00:49:57,120 --> 00:49:59,873
What are you doing
in Tina's apartment?

427
00:49:59,960 --> 00:50:02,713
It's my apartment too.
We're roommates.

428
00:50:02,800 --> 00:50:07,078
Tulsa, I would like you to meet...
But you met her in the Europa.

429
00:50:07,160 --> 00:50:11,119
I'll fix the coffee and the strudel.
Come help me, Tina.

430
00:50:14,600 --> 00:50:18,036
- And how did you get here?
- It wasn't easy!

431
00:50:18,480 --> 00:50:20,436
You fouled it up again.

432
00:50:31,240 --> 00:50:33,754
- What's he doin' up there?
- Who cares?

433
00:50:33,840 --> 00:50:37,958
- Tulsa's gotta be alone with Lili.
- We know.

434
00:50:38,040 --> 00:50:41,794
- I'm supposed to be alone with her.
- You can't be alone with Tina here.

435
00:50:41,880 --> 00:50:43,632
That's right. Get your hat.

436
00:50:45,280 --> 00:50:49,398
Lili, you break your rule.
You let someone in the apartment.

437
00:50:49,480 --> 00:50:54,554
But he's not like the others.
He's so open. And honest.

438
00:50:54,640 --> 00:50:57,279
Just like my Cookie.

439
00:50:57,360 --> 00:50:59,590
- Lili...
- We're nearly ready.

440
00:50:59,680 --> 00:51:03,355
- Sorry, we have to beat it.
- What a pity.

441
00:51:03,440 --> 00:51:06,512
Cookie just reminded me
it's the first night in town

442
00:51:06,600 --> 00:51:08,750
and we have to get back early.

443
00:51:08,840 --> 00:51:12,549
We have passes tomorrow,
we wouldn't want to lose 'em.

444
00:51:13,600 --> 00:51:17,718
- I've got plans for us.
- Tina, hand me a bag, please.

445
00:51:17,840 --> 00:51:20,035
I'll give you some strudel
for the road.

446
00:51:20,120 --> 00:51:22,873
Thanks. Look,
about that pass tomorrow...

447
00:51:22,960 --> 00:51:26,635
If you get a pass, maybe
we can take a trip to Aschaffenburg?

448
00:51:26,720 --> 00:51:31,510
Good. Ever since I was a kid I wanted
to see Aschaffenburg. Where is it?

449
00:51:31,840 --> 00:51:34,991
- We better get going.
- OK, General.

450
00:51:39,600 --> 00:51:42,239
- You speak German?
- You speak Italian?

451
00:51:42,320 --> 00:51:44,515
- Here's the strudel.
- Thank you.

452
00:51:51,000 --> 00:51:52,956
Tina, you know something?

453
00:51:53,040 --> 00:51:55,952
In Oklahoma Indians
do not always play tom-toms.

454
00:51:56,040 --> 00:52:00,397
You know something? Before me,
he only knew girls who raised bagels.

455
00:52:04,040 --> 00:52:06,156
Cookie, how did you get up there?

456
00:52:06,240 --> 00:52:07,878
- I'm stupid.
- Right!

457
00:52:07,960 --> 00:52:11,191
- Turk didn't mention a roommate.
- You didn't ask.

458
00:52:11,280 --> 00:52:14,670
Look, why don't you give up
and let me pay off the bet?

459
00:52:14,760 --> 00:52:17,513
- Because we're gonna win. Right?
- Right.

460
00:52:17,600 --> 00:52:21,593
Tonight, reconnaissance,
tomorrow the Battle of the Bulge.

461
00:52:37,160 --> 00:52:40,277
Watch where you're going!
What the...?

462
00:52:40,360 --> 00:52:42,794
Hi, Sarge. Glad you dropped by.

463
00:52:42,880 --> 00:52:47,271
- I'd like a pass this afternoon.
- As of now you're on guard duty.

464
00:52:47,360 --> 00:52:49,954
- But it's Saturday!
- So it's Saturday.

465
00:52:50,040 --> 00:52:54,397
- This is important. It's for us!
- What do you mean it's for us?

466
00:52:54,480 --> 00:52:58,359
I'm gonna try and get the trio
booked on the Armed Forces Show.

467
00:52:58,440 --> 00:53:02,911
It'll be worth a fortune
in publicity for our nightclub.

468
00:53:03,000 --> 00:53:06,879
- Why didn't you say so, partner?
- I guess I'm just stupid.

469
00:53:09,400 --> 00:53:11,675
Sergeant McGraw.

470
00:53:11,760 --> 00:53:15,389
Thanks, Sarge. And you
better make one out for Cookie.

471
00:53:16,920 --> 00:53:21,357
- Sergeant McGraw.
- Thanks, Sarge.

472
00:53:21,440 --> 00:53:24,477
And Rick, too.
They might want us to audition.

473
00:53:24,560 --> 00:53:29,759
Maybe I oughtta go along with ya.
You could say I'm your manager.

474
00:53:29,840 --> 00:53:33,230
We'd love to have you, Sarge,
but they need you here.

475
00:53:33,320 --> 00:53:36,073
- You run this outfit.
- I do?

476
00:53:37,160 --> 00:53:40,948
- Yeah. Yeah, I do.
- Thanks, Sarge. Thanks.

477
00:53:52,480 --> 00:53:55,074
Everything that moves
reminds me of that girl.

478
00:53:55,160 --> 00:53:57,116
Of all the rotten luck.

479
00:53:57,200 --> 00:54:00,112
First I get transferred
to Africa for a year,

480
00:54:00,200 --> 00:54:04,876
then when I get here, the landlady
says Marla moves and left no address.

481
00:54:04,960 --> 00:54:06,712
That's tough.

482
00:54:08,880 --> 00:54:12,156
You did it! All she needed
was a little sweetening.

483
00:54:12,240 --> 00:54:16,438
A little sweetening.
That's how I get to her landlady!

484
00:54:16,520 --> 00:54:19,080
- Thanks, Cook!
- What did I say?

485
00:54:19,160 --> 00:54:22,152
All right, knock it off.
Three day passes.

486
00:54:24,440 --> 00:54:26,795
- For you.
- You're a pal, I can sure use it!

487
00:54:26,880 --> 00:54:28,916
How'd you do it? Never mind.

488
00:54:29,000 --> 00:54:32,037
Lili's picking me up
at the gate in half an hour.

489
00:54:32,120 --> 00:54:34,395
You're doing real good with Lili.

490
00:54:34,480 --> 00:54:39,395
But I'm not enjoying it like I
should, with the bet and everything.

491
00:54:39,480 --> 00:54:41,948
Don't let it bother you,
it's natural.

492
00:54:42,040 --> 00:54:44,076
You like Lili and she likes you.

493
00:54:44,160 --> 00:54:48,199
If your buddies make a little money
on the side, is that bad?

494
00:54:48,280 --> 00:54:50,919
- I guess not.
- That's better!

495
00:55:04,120 --> 00:55:05,553
Good luck.

496
00:55:08,080 --> 00:55:11,277
Good afternoon. I like that better.

497
00:55:25,360 --> 00:55:29,956
- Hope I'm as lucky as he is.
- I hope so, too. There's our bus.

498
00:55:49,320 --> 00:55:53,438
- The soldier...
- I wanna talk to you about Marla.

499
00:55:53,520 --> 00:55:56,592
I told you yesterday,
Marla does not live here.

500
00:55:56,680 --> 00:55:59,592
She has moved. Where? I do not know.

501
00:55:59,680 --> 00:56:02,114
- Maybe this will help...
- Young man,

502
00:56:02,200 --> 00:56:05,397
if you gave me one million marks
I still could not tell you.

503
00:56:05,480 --> 00:56:07,436
- But...
- Do not come back.

504
00:56:07,520 --> 00:56:10,239
You waste your time and my time.

505
00:56:33,320 --> 00:56:37,996
- Marla? Gracious, child...
- Yes, Mrs Hagemannn?

506
00:56:38,080 --> 00:56:41,834
- He was here again.
- I hope he will not come back.

507
00:56:43,560 --> 00:56:47,314
Only when you are in love
can you be so angry with someone.

508
00:56:47,400 --> 00:56:51,951
Why don't you see him?
He seems such a nice young man.

509
00:56:52,040 --> 00:56:55,112
I'm sure if he knew
the circumstances, he...

510
00:56:55,200 --> 00:57:01,116
Please, Mrs Hagemannn, I do not
wish to talk about him. Please!

511
00:57:30,280 --> 00:57:33,033
Do you have scenery like this
in Oklahoma?

512
00:57:33,120 --> 00:57:34,872
No, ma'am.

513
00:57:34,960 --> 00:57:38,714
I mean, we have Catfish Creek
and Red River, that's about it.

514
00:57:38,800 --> 00:57:40,358
Come on.

515
00:57:59,760 --> 00:58:04,117
Frankfurt am Main is so called
because it is on the river Main,

516
00:58:04,200 --> 00:58:08,432
which flows into the Rhine,
which eventually flows into the sea.

517
00:58:08,520 --> 00:58:11,114
Wouldn't want it any other way.

518
00:58:11,200 --> 00:58:15,557
Observe this excellent example
of ancient handiwork.

519
00:58:15,640 --> 00:58:20,270
Dated by the artist
in the year 1959.

520
00:58:23,040 --> 00:58:26,271
For those who do not know,
"liebe" means "love".

521
00:58:26,360 --> 00:58:28,794
You don't have
to explain that to a GI,

522
00:58:28,880 --> 00:58:31,155
that's one of
the first words he learns.

523
00:58:31,240 --> 00:58:33,356
- You, too, Tulsa?
- Absolutely.

524
00:58:33,440 --> 00:58:38,514
- Like, liebe that sauerkraut.
- I was not thinking of sauerkraut.

525
00:58:38,600 --> 00:58:40,352
Here's another one.

526
00:58:41,960 --> 00:58:44,190
I have one, too.

527
00:58:46,960 --> 00:58:50,953
- Fritz gets around.
- You know?

528
00:58:52,280 --> 00:58:54,794
You know,
I have something to confess.

529
00:58:54,880 --> 00:58:57,917
Last night when I sat down
at your table, I thought,

530
00:58:58,000 --> 00:59:01,515
- "another one to watch out for."
- And when you sat down I figured,

531
00:59:01,600 --> 00:59:05,070
"Here she is,
the gal I've heard so much about."

532
00:59:05,160 --> 00:59:07,993
- I have a reputation?
- A good one.

533
00:59:08,080 --> 00:59:12,039
You're supposed to be a cold potato.
A human iceberg.

534
00:59:12,120 --> 00:59:14,156
The original fish eye.

535
00:59:14,240 --> 00:59:17,471
Please, so many compliments
will go to my head!

536
00:59:24,280 --> 00:59:26,032
Pretty, ja?

537
00:59:52,000 --> 00:59:53,956
Apaches.

538
00:59:54,680 --> 00:59:57,433
What are they excited about?
The circus in town?

539
00:59:57,520 --> 01:00:01,718
- Better than that. A puppet show.
- Yeah? I've never seen one before.

540
01:00:01,800 --> 01:00:04,394
Sometimes I wish
I was seven years old.

541
01:00:04,480 --> 01:00:06,391
Come on, let's be seven again.

542
01:00:29,840 --> 01:00:33,196
If the soldier really loves her,
he'll never give up.

543
01:00:33,280 --> 01:00:35,032
10-1 he chickens out.

544
01:00:35,120 --> 01:00:37,395
- Bet?
- Bet.

545
01:00:45,760 --> 01:00:47,796
Happy ending. You win.

546
01:00:50,920 --> 01:00:53,354
It's not over yet,
now he sings to her.

547
01:00:53,440 --> 01:00:56,113
- No music.
- It's a full orchestra.

548
01:01:33,080 --> 01:01:34,308
- I'll get that thing going.
- Yes.

549
01:01:43,520 --> 01:01:47,718
You know this tune?
Could you play it on your squeezebox?

550
01:01:49,040 --> 01:01:53,158
- Let's give it a whirl.
- We give it, like you say, a whirl.

551
01:01:53,240 --> 01:01:54,992
I'll try anything once.

552
01:04:18,600 --> 01:04:22,513
In front, the famous Niederwald.
The summit of the Niederwald

553
01:04:22,600 --> 01:04:27,310
rises 985 feet above sea level,
740 feet above the river.

554
01:04:27,400 --> 01:04:29,960
These things ever break down?

555
01:04:30,040 --> 01:04:32,634
Suppose we got stuck
up there all night?

556
01:04:32,720 --> 01:04:36,679
- No need to worry.
- I wasn't worried, I was hoping.

557
01:04:48,800 --> 01:04:52,429
I kinda like it up here.
It's very cosy.

558
01:04:56,080 --> 01:05:00,039
The vineyards of the Niederwald
have existed for 300 years.

559
01:05:04,960 --> 01:05:09,112
- Riding forward makes me dizzy.
- Well, you better sit here.

560
01:05:11,480 --> 01:05:13,789
Yeah, and I'll sit over here.

561
01:05:14,880 --> 01:05:18,475
Observe the neatness and precision
of the grape fields.

562
01:05:19,880 --> 01:05:23,873
- Tulsa! What are you doing?
- I just wanna sit next to you.

563
01:05:25,360 --> 01:05:28,511
- Isn't that better?
- Much better.

564
01:08:11,920 --> 01:08:15,799
You're very quiet. You haven't
said anything for such a long time.

565
01:08:17,800 --> 01:08:22,749
- Didn't you enjoy yourself today?
- Yes, I did. Maybe too much.

566
01:08:27,400 --> 01:08:29,994
So far,
I've been making all the plans.

567
01:08:30,080 --> 01:08:33,595
Tonight, after work,
we do what you want.

568
01:08:42,960 --> 01:08:44,712
Come on, honey.

569
01:08:47,520 --> 01:08:50,592
You're so generous
to buy me a ticket to Milano.

570
01:08:50,680 --> 01:08:55,071
- I'll be so happy to see my family.
- I know what it is to be homesick.

571
01:08:55,160 --> 01:08:57,355
I can't go back to Park Avenue yet,

572
01:08:57,440 --> 01:09:00,796
but I can certainly treat you
to a visit to your family.

573
01:09:00,880 --> 01:09:02,950
- Thank you.
- Keepen Sie the change.

574
01:09:03,040 --> 01:09:04,996
Don't miss that plane.

575
01:09:10,680 --> 01:09:13,990
- It won't be long, now.
- You're so sweet to do this.

576
01:09:14,080 --> 01:09:18,676
I'm doing it for me, too.
I mean, if you're happy, I'm happy.

577
01:09:18,760 --> 01:09:22,753
"The plane for Milano
has been delayed two hours."

578
01:09:22,840 --> 01:09:27,038
Cookie, you do not have to stay.
You have been too kind already.

579
01:09:27,120 --> 01:09:32,148
- How can I ever repay you?
- I'II...think of something.

580
01:09:34,160 --> 01:09:35,718
Bye, Tina.

581
01:09:39,320 --> 01:09:40,958
Come in.

582
01:09:46,160 --> 01:09:50,119
Well, my millionaire from Oklahoma,
where do we go tonight?

583
01:09:50,200 --> 01:09:52,236
That's what I wanna talk about.

584
01:09:52,320 --> 01:09:55,551
- I have to break our date.
- You have no more pass?

585
01:09:55,640 --> 01:09:58,677
No, I just have to call off
our date, that's all.

586
01:10:00,920 --> 01:10:03,753
I should have realised,
you're a soldier,

587
01:10:03,840 --> 01:10:06,877
you can't afford
to take a girl out every night.

588
01:10:06,960 --> 01:10:12,193
No, it's nothing like that.
I had a great time this afternoon.

589
01:10:12,280 --> 01:10:15,750
- So did I.
- I've been thinking about it since.

590
01:10:15,840 --> 01:10:18,308
- I like you a lot.
- I'm glad.

591
01:10:18,400 --> 01:10:21,233
- More than a lot.
- I'm more than glad.

592
01:10:21,320 --> 01:10:24,630
You see, a guy like me,
on temporary duty,

593
01:10:24,720 --> 01:10:29,555
meets a girl he thinks a lot of,
like you.

594
01:10:29,640 --> 01:10:32,677
They go out together
and have a good time,

595
01:10:32,760 --> 01:10:36,309
and suddenly
things start to get serious.

596
01:10:36,400 --> 01:10:41,076
Before you know it, somebody gets
hurt. I don't want that to happen.

597
01:10:44,520 --> 01:10:49,116
I see. You've obviously
given the matter much thought.

598
01:10:49,440 --> 01:10:51,078
I have.

599
01:10:53,200 --> 01:10:57,955
You're telling me it would be best
for me if we do not see each other.

600
01:11:01,920 --> 01:11:03,876
Well, I guess that's it.

601
01:11:18,440 --> 01:11:20,158
- Hi, Tulse!
- Have a chair.

602
01:11:20,240 --> 01:11:24,756
Good news, no roommate tonight.
I bought Tina a ticket to Milano.

603
01:11:24,840 --> 01:11:28,913
- Sorry, I just cancelled.
- You what? Oh, no.

604
01:11:29,000 --> 01:11:33,118
- You didn't tell Lili about the bet?
- I just called off our date.

605
01:11:33,200 --> 01:11:35,270
No point us both thinking I'm a heel.

606
01:11:35,360 --> 01:11:38,113
- You're mad.
- I'm going to the barracks.

607
01:11:38,200 --> 01:11:41,829
The bet is off. Nothing you can say
will change my mind.

608
01:11:41,920 --> 01:11:46,152
OK, so you were born with a
decent streak. It's not your fault.

609
01:11:46,240 --> 01:11:49,152
- Nobody's perfect.
- Sorry, fellas.

610
01:11:50,560 --> 01:11:52,516
A stein of gin.

611
01:11:58,080 --> 01:12:00,036
Rick's been trying to reach you.

612
01:12:00,120 --> 01:12:02,953
Left this number.
Very important, he says.

613
01:12:04,040 --> 01:12:05,996
Thanks a lot.

614
01:12:16,600 --> 01:12:19,831
- What's everybody so happy about?
- Shut up.

615
01:12:19,920 --> 01:12:21,876
What did I say?

616
01:12:24,160 --> 01:12:26,435
I got an idea! Don't do nothing.

617
01:12:26,520 --> 01:12:29,478
Where's he going?
What are you guys planning?

618
01:12:32,280 --> 01:12:34,635
- Yes?
- It's me, Cookie.

619
01:12:36,840 --> 01:12:38,796
Come in.

620
01:12:41,680 --> 01:12:45,036
- I'm very pleased to see you.
- You are?

621
01:12:45,960 --> 01:12:49,589
I was just having a drink.
Won't you join me?

622
01:12:49,680 --> 01:12:51,636
I don't mind if I do.

623
01:12:52,720 --> 01:12:56,349
It's none of my business...
You were gonna drink this, alone?

624
01:12:56,440 --> 01:12:59,159
Not all. Just a little.

625
01:13:00,240 --> 01:13:02,834
- My morale is very low, Cookie.
- Mine, too.

626
01:13:02,920 --> 01:13:05,195
I was gonna ask for a tranquilliser.

627
01:13:05,280 --> 01:13:07,236
This should help.

628
01:13:10,600 --> 01:13:13,637
It's too bad about you and Tulsa.

629
01:13:15,560 --> 01:13:20,111
He's quite a character, your friend.
I'm not used to men who break dates.

630
01:13:20,200 --> 01:13:24,432
- I don't blame you for being sore.
- I'm not sore...

631
01:13:26,600 --> 01:13:30,912
I admire him. We'll drink a toast.

632
01:13:32,240 --> 01:13:36,199
- To a gentleman.
- Yeah. Here's to Benedict Arnold.

633
01:13:38,360 --> 01:13:42,319
You know, Cookie, in this business
it's very unusual,

634
01:13:42,400 --> 01:13:46,518
and very refreshing,
to meet a young man with principles.

635
01:13:48,560 --> 01:13:50,835
I shall miss him.

636
01:13:50,920 --> 01:13:53,673
- Your number, Miss Lili.
- Yes, I'm ready.

637
01:13:53,760 --> 01:13:57,389
- You'll excuse me?
- I gotta join my gang, too.

638
01:14:00,120 --> 01:14:02,680
I wouldn't miss your number, Lili.

639
01:14:12,680 --> 01:14:17,117
Fellas, I'm the guy that just left
the babe that is carrying a torch.

640
01:14:17,200 --> 01:14:20,033
The welcome mat is still out
for Tulsa.

641
01:17:02,120 --> 01:17:04,236
Cookie,
I thought Tina was in Milano?

642
01:17:04,320 --> 01:17:06,959
She is. The roommate!

643
01:17:08,800 --> 01:17:13,555
She's probably been there
and back already. See ya later.

644
01:17:16,320 --> 01:17:18,754
Tina, baby, you shouldn't be here.

645
01:17:18,840 --> 01:17:22,310
- I changed my mind!
- But you were so homesick.

646
01:17:22,400 --> 01:17:25,551
But then, after you leave,
I am homesick for you.

647
01:17:25,640 --> 01:17:28,598
- And I miss my work.
- I missed you, too, sugar.

648
01:17:30,000 --> 01:17:34,710
After you finish work we're gonna
do the town. You and your Cookie.

649
01:17:34,800 --> 01:17:36,756
Good, Cookie!

650
01:18:01,880 --> 01:18:04,838
Tulse! Come on in!
Glad you came over.

651
01:18:04,920 --> 01:18:08,037
- What you all shook up about?
- Take your hat off.

652
01:18:08,120 --> 01:18:12,159
All right, sit down. Sit down.
Stand up, stand up.

653
01:18:12,960 --> 01:18:14,712
First, have a cigar.

654
01:18:14,800 --> 01:18:17,678
You said it was an emergency,
not to give me a cigar.

655
01:18:17,760 --> 01:18:20,274
I found Marla.
We're gonna be married.

656
01:18:20,360 --> 01:18:23,352
How about that.
You want me to be best man, right?

657
01:18:23,440 --> 01:18:27,035
- No, we need a baby-sitter.
- Baby-sitter?!

658
01:18:32,720 --> 01:18:36,679
- Hello. Good to see you again.
- It's good to see you.

659
01:18:37,800 --> 01:18:41,839
- Both of you!
- He's beautiful, no?

660
01:18:41,920 --> 01:18:45,469
He's beautiful, yes.
But how did...?

661
01:18:45,560 --> 01:18:49,314
I mean, who did...
I don't know. Congratulations.

662
01:18:50,640 --> 01:18:55,395
Can you imagine? I still wouldn't
know if her landlady hadn't said.

663
01:18:55,480 --> 01:18:57,755
Mrs Hagemannn is a very wise woman.

664
01:18:57,840 --> 01:19:00,274
Tulse must have a million questions.

665
01:19:00,360 --> 01:19:02,999
- Well...
- Tell him about your silly pride.

666
01:19:03,080 --> 01:19:06,550
You ran out on me with a baby on
the way, without letting me know.

667
01:19:06,640 --> 01:19:11,634
It was not pride. But when I received
a letter from a young lady in America

668
01:19:11,720 --> 01:19:15,349
saying she is engaged
to the man who says he loves me...

669
01:19:15,440 --> 01:19:19,672
That was her story!
I already had a licence to marry you.

670
01:19:19,760 --> 01:19:21,716
And the CO's permission.

671
01:19:21,800 --> 01:19:24,792
But I did not know!
You should have told me.

672
01:19:24,880 --> 01:19:27,440
You never gave me a chance.
You were gone.

673
01:19:27,520 --> 01:19:30,910
- Look, I...
- Sorry, Tulse, go ahead.

674
01:19:31,000 --> 01:19:33,798
No, I think
you just answered 'em all.

675
01:19:33,880 --> 01:19:37,395
We're making a trip
to Heidelberg to use that licence.

676
01:19:37,480 --> 01:19:41,155
- That's why we need a baby-sitter.
- I'm glad to help, Rick,

677
01:19:41,240 --> 01:19:44,630
but the GI manual didn't brief us
on this emergency.

678
01:19:44,720 --> 01:19:47,837
You'll have no trouble.
If he cries, give him his bottle.

679
01:19:47,920 --> 01:19:49,876
His formula's all fixed.

680
01:19:49,960 --> 01:19:53,350
But he will not cry.
He's a very good baby.

681
01:19:53,440 --> 01:19:56,796
- Good.
- I'll put him back to bed.

682
01:19:59,040 --> 01:20:02,430
Good night, Son. Night, little fella!

683
01:20:04,000 --> 01:20:06,275
- Say good night to him.
- Good night.

684
01:20:07,360 --> 01:20:09,828
- I gotta buy him a present.
- A bicycle?

685
01:20:09,920 --> 01:20:11,956
- Bicycle?
- Sure, he's a boy.

686
01:20:12,040 --> 01:20:15,715
- What's his name.
- Junior.

687
01:20:15,800 --> 01:20:17,836
Junior? Well, that figures.

688
01:20:20,800 --> 01:20:22,756
Ready, honey?

689
01:20:25,840 --> 01:20:28,912
- He will sleep like a baby.
- He is a baby.

690
01:20:29,000 --> 01:20:32,675
- We're off.
- Come back any time.

691
01:20:32,760 --> 01:20:37,834
If you're hungry there's liverwurst
in the icebox, by the baby's bottle.

692
01:20:37,920 --> 01:20:40,070
- Take care.
- I'll do that.

693
01:21:01,320 --> 01:21:03,231
Air raid!

694
01:21:09,240 --> 01:21:13,836
Just be calm. Just calm down.
Calm down. That goes for both of us.

695
01:21:14,880 --> 01:21:18,111
Don't be scared. Don't be scared!

696
01:21:21,880 --> 01:21:26,590
Your ma and pa'll be right back.
They just went away to get married.

697
01:21:30,560 --> 01:21:33,199
I'm your uncle Tulsa. Let's play.

698
01:21:33,280 --> 01:21:35,510
Look, look...

699
01:21:37,560 --> 01:21:41,792
I don't blame you.
I know, you're hungry, aren't ya?

700
01:21:41,880 --> 01:21:43,871
Well, we'll fix that.

701
01:21:44,760 --> 01:21:46,876
We'll fix that.

702
01:21:46,960 --> 01:21:50,316
At ease, at ease. Wait, wait.

703
01:21:52,000 --> 01:21:55,549
Take it easy, now.
You stay right here.

704
01:21:55,640 --> 01:21:58,871
You stay right here
and I'll get your milk, OK?

705
01:21:58,960 --> 01:22:02,191
Just don't run off anywhere.
Just don't run off.

706
01:22:06,480 --> 01:22:08,630
See what you made me do?

707
01:22:09,680 --> 01:22:11,636
I'll be there. Schnell.

708
01:22:12,520 --> 01:22:14,397
Enough.

709
01:22:16,400 --> 01:22:19,153
Wait! You can't have that.

710
01:22:19,240 --> 01:22:22,596
Come on, give it to your uncle Tulsa.
Come on.

711
01:22:25,360 --> 01:22:27,476
Army Manual, section 43.

712
01:22:27,560 --> 01:22:31,633
When in hand-to-hand combat,
apply judo chop to the back of neck.

713
01:22:31,720 --> 01:22:34,678
If you was only my size,
you little rascal.

714
01:22:34,760 --> 01:22:36,910
Come on, give it here.

715
01:22:40,440 --> 01:22:43,671
Milk... Milk...
Gotta have... No milk.

716
01:22:44,760 --> 01:22:46,716
Gotta get milk.

717
01:22:47,880 --> 01:22:49,836
I gotta get help.

718
01:22:51,760 --> 01:22:53,876
You make more noise than a tank.

719
01:23:02,680 --> 01:23:06,514
Give me the Café Europa, please,
it's an emergency.

720
01:23:11,120 --> 01:23:12,872
Telephone, Miss Lili.

721
01:23:16,600 --> 01:23:19,637
- Hello.
- Hello, Lili? It's me, Tulsa.

722
01:23:22,200 --> 01:23:26,079
- What's all that noise?
- That's the baby.

723
01:23:26,160 --> 01:23:27,673
Baby?

724
01:23:29,760 --> 01:23:33,753
I don't wanna bother you
at work, but I'm baby-sitting

725
01:23:33,840 --> 01:23:38,197
for a buddy who's gone to get
married, and I'm in trouble!

726
01:23:38,280 --> 01:23:41,590
I know, you don't know
how to change a diaper.

727
01:23:41,680 --> 01:23:43,989
I haven't come to that problem yet.

728
01:23:47,040 --> 01:23:48,996
I don't think I have.

729
01:23:49,080 --> 01:23:51,469
The bottle
with the kid's formula broke

730
01:23:51,560 --> 01:23:54,870
and he's crying and everything,
and he's goin' nuts...

731
01:23:54,960 --> 01:23:59,238
- I tell you, it's an emergency.
- I was just leaving, Tulsa.

732
01:23:59,320 --> 01:24:02,790
I can meet you in my apartment
in about 20 minutes.

733
01:24:02,880 --> 01:24:07,237
I'll be right over. Goodbye.
Come on, Tiger.

734
01:24:13,960 --> 01:24:16,076
Good news, boys, that was Tulsa.

735
01:24:16,160 --> 01:24:19,550
Love is in bloom.
You shoulda heard that honey voice.

736
01:24:19,640 --> 01:24:25,033
"Meet you in my apartment, Tulsa."
Don't just sit there, get going!

737
01:24:25,120 --> 01:24:27,076
Operation Dawn Patrol!

738
01:24:32,080 --> 01:24:35,072
Hang on. Just take it easy, now.

739
01:24:36,440 --> 01:24:38,795
I'm sure glad women have the babies.

740
01:25:07,800 --> 01:25:09,438
What's he bringing her?

741
01:25:09,520 --> 01:25:12,671
A magnum of champagne, you dope!
This boy thinks big!

742
01:25:12,760 --> 01:25:15,274
It's only 2:30.
He could be kicked out.

743
01:25:15,360 --> 01:25:18,477
He won't. Let's get some coffee,
we got a long wait.

744
01:25:26,880 --> 01:25:29,872
Tiger is quiet. He's a good baby.

745
01:25:29,960 --> 01:25:33,509
He's a time bomb. You never
know when he's gonna go off.

746
01:25:33,600 --> 01:25:36,717
Only kidding.
Nothing personal, Tiger.

747
01:25:38,040 --> 01:25:42,238
Lili, I'm sorry to bother you
so late and everything, but...

748
01:25:42,320 --> 01:25:46,552
You're the first person
I could think of. The only one.

749
01:25:46,640 --> 01:25:48,596
I'm flattered.

750
01:25:49,360 --> 01:25:53,558
I'm also very glad. I didn't think
I would see you again.

751
01:25:54,680 --> 01:25:56,636
That goes for me, too.

752
01:25:56,720 --> 01:26:00,474
Yes, sir, I'm sure glad
I had to baby-sit tonight.

753
01:26:01,520 --> 01:26:05,115
- You like babies?
- After they grow up.

754
01:26:10,000 --> 01:26:14,391
None of that "coochie-coochie".
You just sit there.

755
01:26:16,600 --> 01:26:19,239
He's ready to bust loose again.

756
01:26:23,680 --> 01:26:25,636
All babies love to cry.

757
01:26:25,720 --> 01:26:29,759
Sometimes because they're hungry,
or teething, or sleeping.

758
01:26:29,840 --> 01:26:32,877
And sometimes
just so they can hear a lullaby.

759
01:26:34,160 --> 01:26:36,993
I get it. Blackmail.

760
01:26:37,080 --> 01:26:40,550
Certainly. Don't they have
lullabies in Oklahoma?

761
01:26:43,000 --> 01:26:45,116
I don't like the look in your eye.

762
01:26:48,480 --> 01:26:53,679
OK, I'm going. Just trying
to remember the words. Lullaby...

763
01:28:28,680 --> 01:28:31,114
Guess I took care
of that pretty well.

764
01:28:32,120 --> 01:28:36,477
And as your reward,
you can help me clean the kitchen.

765
01:28:36,960 --> 01:28:38,916
KP duty again.

766
01:28:56,160 --> 01:29:01,473
One o'clock, on the dot. Like
I said, it's too early to go home.

767
01:29:01,560 --> 01:29:05,155
Again one o'clock.
It was one o'clock two hours ago.

768
01:29:06,960 --> 01:29:11,192
What do you know? My watch stopped.
Waiter? Waiter!

769
01:29:12,600 --> 01:29:14,511
Beer. We'd like more beer.

770
01:29:15,640 --> 01:29:21,510
Cookie, I am not thirsty.
I am tired. I want to go home.

771
01:29:27,600 --> 01:29:29,750
Man, this is really baby-sitting.

772
01:29:32,720 --> 01:29:35,837
- He's sleeping.
- He won't be any more trouble.

773
01:29:35,920 --> 01:29:38,434
You mean I should take him home?

774
01:29:39,560 --> 01:29:41,710
While he's asleep it would be better.

775
01:29:44,760 --> 01:29:48,116
Might as well get going,
as long as he's asleep.

776
01:29:49,320 --> 01:29:51,276
I think so.

777
01:29:52,320 --> 01:29:54,276
I'll get his basket.

778
01:30:03,560 --> 01:30:06,199
Wake up, Tiger! Wake up, Tiger.

779
01:30:08,000 --> 01:30:11,879
Wake up, Tiger. Attaboy.

780
01:30:15,400 --> 01:30:17,391
I knew you wouldn't let me down.

781
01:30:18,320 --> 01:30:23,348
That settles it! You better stay
until he's asleep again.

782
01:30:28,040 --> 01:30:29,678
Good boy.

783
01:30:41,440 --> 01:30:43,590
- There he is.
- No dice!

784
01:30:43,680 --> 01:30:46,240
It's dawn, pal. You're dead.

785
01:30:46,760 --> 01:30:48,671
Tulsa!

786
01:30:48,760 --> 01:30:51,991
You have the bottle
but you forgot the milk.

787
01:30:54,840 --> 01:30:57,877
Will I see you tomorrow?
I mean, today.

788
01:30:57,960 --> 01:31:00,394
Yes, but not
for the whole afternoon.

789
01:31:00,480 --> 01:31:04,359
I have rehearsal tomorrow...today.
For your Armed Forces Show.

790
01:31:04,440 --> 01:31:07,113
We're on it, too. I'll see you there.

791
01:31:07,200 --> 01:31:11,273
- Yes.
- Well...goodbye.

792
01:31:12,600 --> 01:31:16,388
- Goodbye.
- I forgot something.

793
01:31:17,480 --> 01:31:20,119
He sure is working overtime.

794
01:31:24,960 --> 01:31:26,791
I'm glad you came to Germany.

795
01:31:26,880 --> 01:31:29,553
I'm going to write a thank-you letter
to your draft board.

796
01:31:29,640 --> 01:31:33,189
That'll surprise 'em, they never
got a thank-you letter before.

797
01:31:49,320 --> 01:31:51,834
I get 10, he gets 20...

798
01:31:53,520 --> 01:31:56,478
- Dynamite couldn't do better.
- All right.

799
01:31:56,560 --> 01:31:58,915
- As long as we get our dough.
- Don't rub it in.

800
01:32:22,280 --> 01:32:26,159
Very nice. Very nice. I think
we've got it. Thank you, Lili.

801
01:32:26,240 --> 01:32:28,470
Thank you. See you tonight, boys.

802
01:32:36,840 --> 01:32:39,035
All right, gang, take five.

803
01:32:39,120 --> 01:32:42,192
- Hi, Maestro.
- How many numbers do you want?

804
01:32:42,280 --> 01:32:44,430
- One.
- Right. And an encore.

805
01:32:44,520 --> 01:32:48,354
No, one number, no encores.
Rehearsal in 15 minutes.

806
01:32:48,440 --> 01:32:50,396
Don't go away, be right back!

807
01:32:52,040 --> 01:32:54,554
See the Maestro's expression?

808
01:32:56,280 --> 01:32:58,475
- Hi!
- See you later.

809
01:32:58,560 --> 01:33:02,109
Hi. Have you recovered
from your baby-sitting?

810
01:33:02,200 --> 01:33:04,919
Don't run Tiger down,
he did me a big favour.

811
01:33:05,000 --> 01:33:08,788
- I might have never seen you again.
- I'll tell you a secret.

812
01:33:08,880 --> 01:33:12,475
I would have given you one day
to call me. Maybe even two.

813
01:33:12,560 --> 01:33:15,597
Then on the third day,
I would have called you.

814
01:33:15,680 --> 01:33:21,391
Excuse me. The roof's caved in.
Captain Hobart wants to talk to you!

815
01:33:21,480 --> 01:33:24,916
- What about?
- What? Who won the bet for us?!

816
01:33:25,000 --> 01:33:28,629
He did stay in your apartment
till morning, didn't he?

817
01:33:28,720 --> 01:33:31,234
- No offence, ma'am.
- There was no bet.

818
01:33:31,320 --> 01:33:34,312
- We called it off.
- How come everybody got paid?

819
01:33:34,400 --> 01:33:37,517
I gotta find Cookie,
maybe he'll have an angle.

820
01:33:40,120 --> 01:33:42,076
Look, that's not how it was.

821
01:33:42,160 --> 01:33:45,311
Naturally. The whole matter
concerned two other people?

822
01:33:45,400 --> 01:33:47,960
- No, it was us.
- Tell me some other time.

823
01:33:48,040 --> 01:33:50,713
- I'll tell you now.
- Very well, soldier.

824
01:33:50,800 --> 01:33:54,918
- How much did you win?
- Seeing you last night was no bet.

825
01:33:55,000 --> 01:33:58,788
There was no need to borrow a baby
to get into my apartment.

826
01:33:58,880 --> 01:34:01,758
Really, you underestimate
your attraction.

827
01:34:07,320 --> 01:34:10,790
- McLean, you have an appointment.
- I gotta see a pal.

828
01:34:10,880 --> 01:34:12,836
Follow me!

829
01:34:13,880 --> 01:34:15,836
Wait here.

830
01:34:37,560 --> 01:34:41,314
Excuse me, Miss Lili, Captain Hobart
would like to talk to you.

831
01:34:41,400 --> 01:34:43,356
Thank you.

832
01:34:48,480 --> 01:34:53,031
Two babies could not look
so much alike. You are the one.

833
01:34:53,120 --> 01:34:55,554
- You are Lili?
- Yes.

834
01:34:55,640 --> 01:34:57,710
I'm the baby's mother.

835
01:34:58,280 --> 01:35:02,034
It was good of you to help Tulsa.
Men are so helpless.

836
01:35:02,120 --> 01:35:04,554
They are more babies
than the babies.

837
01:35:04,640 --> 01:35:06,517
He was your baby-sitter?

838
01:35:13,280 --> 01:35:17,353
- You're telling me!
- Miss Lili?

839
01:35:21,960 --> 01:35:25,475
Miss Lili,
the Army owes you an apology.

840
01:35:25,560 --> 01:35:29,030
Your rendezvous with this man
had a mercenary motive.

841
01:35:29,120 --> 01:35:33,033
- There was a bet.
- To spend the night with you alone.

842
01:35:33,120 --> 01:35:37,511
I'm afraid that wasn't the case,
Captain. We were well chaperoned.

843
01:35:37,600 --> 01:35:41,149
You see,
Tulsa and I were baby-sitting.

844
01:35:41,240 --> 01:35:42,912
Yes, for Marla and me.

845
01:35:43,000 --> 01:35:46,310
Baby-sitting.
I can't transfer a man for that.

846
01:35:46,400 --> 01:35:50,029
I wish I'd known before
that you did this kind of work.

847
01:35:50,120 --> 01:35:52,588
Mrs Hobart and I
have a date tomorrow.

848
01:35:52,680 --> 01:35:55,513
- How are you with twins?
- Twice as helpful.

849
01:35:55,600 --> 01:36:00,674
Here you go, Tiger. Back to your
poppa. I got work to do. Captain.

850
01:36:04,680 --> 01:36:07,592
Lili, this isn't the time
or the place...

851
01:36:07,680 --> 01:36:10,752
Of course I'll marry you. I love you.

852
01:36:11,600 --> 01:36:14,398
We can get hitched? This afternoon?

853
01:36:15,760 --> 01:36:18,115
- If I get the CO's permission.
- Maybe.

854
01:36:18,200 --> 01:36:21,590
And maybe tonight after the show
you'll win the bet.

855
01:39:18,200 --> 01:39:20,156
Did you ever?

856
01:39:33,040 --> 01:39:34,996
English
