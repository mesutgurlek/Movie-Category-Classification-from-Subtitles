1
00:01:43,500 --> 00:01:45,832
My mother is very sick, Doctor.

2
00:01:47,471 --> 00:01:49,132
Bring her here.
I'll examine her.

3
00:01:49,840 --> 00:01:53,833
No, she can't come here.
She's unconscious.

4
00:01:54,644 --> 00:01:57,670
She doesn't speak anything.
Please come, Doctor.

5
00:01:59,516 --> 00:02:01,484
All right, my boy.
I'll come right away.

6
00:02:27,144 --> 00:02:29,908
Doctor, what's happened
to my mother?

7
00:02:30,514 --> 00:02:32,778
You don't have to worry.

8
00:02:33,383 --> 00:02:35,442
Come to the dispensary in the morning
and take the medication from me.

9
00:02:35,952 --> 00:02:36,941
All right.

10
00:02:38,822 --> 00:02:40,881
Doctor, I hope the poor
woman will recover.

11
00:02:41,625 --> 00:02:44,150
Nothing can be said for certain
since she's not ailing from anything.

12
00:02:44,561 --> 00:02:45,926
In fact, she has suffered
some great setback.

13
00:02:46,596 --> 00:02:50,054
You are right. May the Lord not
let anybody suffer such a setback.

14
00:02:50,400 --> 00:02:54,427
Also remember that it's important
for her to have enough of food.

15
00:02:55,105 --> 00:02:57,403
If she doesn't eat enough,
medicines won't be effective.

16
00:03:33,910 --> 00:03:36,708
Mother... mother!

17
00:03:39,149 --> 00:03:41,845
Drink the medicine, Mother.

18
00:04:01,538 --> 00:04:02,800
Eat it, Mother.

19
00:04:06,109 --> 00:04:10,170
I know that you always eat
after you have fed me.

20
00:04:12,782 --> 00:04:16,149
But I have already eaten.
I'm telling you the truth.

21
00:04:23,193 --> 00:04:24,285
Please eat it...

22
00:04:39,376 --> 00:04:42,174
Don't cry, Mother.
Why are you weeping?

23
00:04:44,381 --> 00:04:47,407
The one who has made us weep
will have to shed tears.

24
00:06:31,288 --> 00:06:32,721
Mother!

25
00:06:34,257 --> 00:06:35,690
Look what's happened to
the little girl!

26
00:06:58,515 --> 00:07:00,244
Hey! Aren't you ready yet?

27
00:07:00,817 --> 00:07:03,411
Come on, get ready quickly.
I will serve breakfast.

28
00:07:07,957 --> 00:07:09,185
I'll come right away, Auntie.

29
00:07:24,040 --> 00:07:27,271
Where's Ajay?

30
00:07:36,353 --> 00:07:39,686
Mother looks so pretty today.

31
00:07:40,724 --> 00:07:45,320
Come on, Mother.
Let's have breakfast now.

32
00:07:46,129 --> 00:07:50,691
Aha! It's a sweet dish!

33
00:07:52,635 --> 00:07:54,899
Open your mouth, Mother.

34
00:08:03,046 --> 00:08:04,809
Now feed me with your own hands.

35
00:08:12,856 --> 00:08:14,483
Did you feed milk
to the little girl?

36
00:08:15,492 --> 00:08:18,120
Yes, Mother. The little girl
has drunk the milk.

37
00:08:18,628 --> 00:08:20,152
And father has gone out
to fetch the medicines.

38
00:08:20,497 --> 00:08:21,862
As soon as he returns
with the medicines...

39
00:08:22,098 --> 00:08:23,531
...we will give the medicine
to the little girl.

40
00:08:25,935 --> 00:08:28,836
Do you know... the little girl
has become very naughty!

41
00:08:29,873 --> 00:08:32,637
She doesn't obey anyone.

42
00:08:38,648 --> 00:08:39,740
Let's go.

43
00:08:41,751 --> 00:08:44,413
I should be leaving now, Mother.

44
00:09:01,471 --> 00:09:02,631
No, Ajay.

45
00:09:05,308 --> 00:09:08,766
You are a son who would
make every mother proud.

46
00:09:09,612 --> 00:09:11,409
You have done so much
for your Mother.

47
00:09:13,016 --> 00:09:15,917
You should be happy that your
Mother has begun talking.

48
00:09:17,020 --> 00:09:18,487
Your efforts have borne fruit.

49
00:09:20,323 --> 00:09:22,154
You too care for her so much.

50
00:09:24,060 --> 00:09:26,358
You have done so much for us
despite being a neighbor.

51
00:09:27,864 --> 00:09:29,388
Not even one's own relatives
don't take so much trouble.

52
00:09:29,799 --> 00:09:33,030
That's enough. You appear to have
become very wise, is it?

53
00:09:33,269 --> 00:09:34,702
I should be leaving.

54
00:10:24,420 --> 00:10:26,217
Stop please... stop!

55
00:10:47,911 --> 00:10:50,675
- It's you?
- Yes. Where are you going?

56
00:10:51,247 --> 00:10:53,147
I was on my way to Bombay.
But I missed the bus.

57
00:10:54,217 --> 00:10:55,980
Is it? I am also heading
towards Bombay. Come in.

58
00:11:05,695 --> 00:11:07,595
We are meeting after many years.
How are you?

59
00:11:08,031 --> 00:11:09,623
I am fine. How's your mother?

60
00:11:11,301 --> 00:11:13,861
Mother is absolutely fine.
How about you?

61
00:11:14,938 --> 00:11:16,963
I went to Pune several times.
But I couldn't meet you.

62
00:11:17,907 --> 00:11:19,101
I am living in Bombay now.

63
00:11:20,076 --> 00:11:22,670
In fact, I travel a lot
between Bombay and Pune.

64
00:11:25,381 --> 00:11:26,973
Ever since my parents have died...

65
00:11:27,817 --> 00:11:29,614
...l've had to take on the
business responsibility.

66
00:11:31,120 --> 00:11:32,280
Your parents passed away?

67
00:11:33,623 --> 00:11:35,989
In the plane-crash two years ago
at the Bangalore airport...

68
00:11:36,926 --> 00:11:40,157
...all the passengers were killed.
My parents were two of them.

69
00:11:44,300 --> 00:11:47,326
Tell me, why are you
going to Bombay?

70
00:11:49,973 --> 00:11:52,441
- In search of someone.
- Searching for whom?

71
00:11:57,113 --> 00:11:58,307
In search of success.

72
00:12:16,232 --> 00:12:19,030
Wait, fatso. I will
pick up the phone.

73
00:12:19,969 --> 00:12:22,631
I am the head servant of
this house. Understand?

74
00:12:23,473 --> 00:12:24,667
Why do you answer the phone?

75
00:12:25,408 --> 00:12:28,036
You are unable to remember anything.
You speak however you like.

76
00:12:28,544 --> 00:12:30,205
And then I have to bear with
the abuses of Mr. Chopra.

77
00:12:31,481 --> 00:12:34,348
Go away from here. Go and wash
the utensils in the kitchen.

78
00:12:36,185 --> 00:12:38,915
I don't remember anything?
How can he say that?

79
00:12:57,940 --> 00:13:00,807
I am Mr. Bajodia speaking
from Ahmedabad...

80
00:13:01,144 --> 00:13:03,476
...who deals in boxes, buckets
and tumblers. Who are you?

81
00:13:04,147 --> 00:13:09,813
I am Babulal, the head servant
of this household.

82
00:13:11,521 --> 00:13:16,356
You see, I've to come to Bombay to
discuss about my son's marriage.

83
00:13:17,060 --> 00:13:18,391
You hand over the phone
to Mr. Chopra.

84
00:13:19,295 --> 00:13:23,732
Just a minute.
Fatso, who's Mr. Chopra here?

85
00:13:24,801 --> 00:13:27,065
Mr. Chopra is our employer.

86
00:13:30,773 --> 00:13:34,209
Just hold on. I will
go and find him.

87
00:13:45,321 --> 00:13:49,382
If daddy telephones,
tell him that...

88
00:13:49,625 --> 00:13:51,490
...I will go straight to the
health club from the college.

89
00:13:51,728 --> 00:13:53,127
- All right?
- Yes.

90
00:13:59,135 --> 00:14:01,899
There's nobody around, and the phone
has been kept off the instrument.

91
00:14:02,405 --> 00:14:05,238
If I am not around for a day,
what would happen of this house?

92
00:14:06,609 --> 00:14:11,012
- How are you, Sir?
- I am fine.

93
00:14:11,280 --> 00:14:15,546
I telephoned to ask you when I should
come to see the girl.

94
00:14:15,885 --> 00:14:17,614
You may come whenever you like.

95
00:14:18,254 --> 00:14:21,314
Tell me, how's your business doing?

96
00:14:22,225 --> 00:14:25,683
Potatoes and onions have
become just too expensive.

97
00:14:26,062 --> 00:14:30,829
Even the tomatoes, chilies
and ginger too!

98
00:14:31,400 --> 00:14:34,858
- Who's this speaking?
- I am Babulal, the head servant.

99
00:14:36,439 --> 00:14:39,374
- What's wrong with you?
- You should've told me so.

100
00:14:39,842 --> 00:14:41,503
You're giving me a hard time.

101
00:14:41,878 --> 00:14:43,937
I want to speak to Mr. Chopra.
Give me the telephone.

102
00:14:45,448 --> 00:14:47,848
Mr. Chopra has left
for the college.

103
00:14:50,286 --> 00:14:53,153
Mr. Chopra still studies
in the college?

104
00:14:56,025 --> 00:14:57,993
She's arrived! Here I go.

105
00:14:59,428 --> 00:15:03,364
O Lord Hanuman! If she looks in
my direction lovingly...

106
00:15:03,866 --> 00:15:06,198
...I would make an offering of half
a coconut at your temple.

107
00:15:07,236 --> 00:15:08,362
Move away.

108
00:15:17,747 --> 00:15:19,339
- Have you brought my history notes?
- Yes.

109
00:15:19,849 --> 00:15:21,749
And I have brought your love story
which was kept inside it.

110
00:15:22,084 --> 00:15:23,381
- Love story?
- Come over here.

111
00:15:28,291 --> 00:15:30,418
I'll show you. Look!

112
00:15:33,262 --> 00:15:36,163
I can understand that it's your heart
that has been targeted.

113
00:15:36,499 --> 00:15:39,332
But whose arrow is it which
has wounded your heart?

114
00:15:39,936 --> 00:15:42,063
Not now. I will tell
you at the right time.

115
00:15:42,405 --> 00:15:43,394
All right.

116
00:15:44,540 --> 00:15:47,031
- Let's go to the canteen.
- You'll miss the psycho lectures?

117
00:15:47,543 --> 00:15:51,035
I won't attend any class today.
I will tell Ravi when he comes.

118
00:15:55,151 --> 00:15:57,847
Did you see? You remembered him
and he came over to you.

119
00:15:59,188 --> 00:16:02,851
Is that all? I will copy
all the notes of psychology...

120
00:16:03,159 --> 00:16:05,684
...and hand it over to you.
You need not attend the lecture.

121
00:16:06,696 --> 00:16:10,154
I knew that you are the only one in
college whom I could depend upon.

122
00:16:39,829 --> 00:16:40,887
Where did it go?

123
00:16:42,365 --> 00:16:44,959
What kind of a lover are you?
You've returned after so many days.

124
00:16:45,468 --> 00:16:48,096
Today, you should have been waiting
anxiously for your darling to arrive!

125
00:16:48,537 --> 00:16:51,131
Whereas you've your eyes
fixed on this book!

126
00:16:54,176 --> 00:16:59,307
At least they don't
make you wait!

127
00:17:01,717 --> 00:17:05,653
- Are you angry?
- Yes. I am very angry.

128
00:17:08,157 --> 00:17:11,957
Do you know that you've been late
by six-and-a-half minutes?

129
00:17:12,695 --> 00:17:15,960
- Please forgive me.
- No! No forgiveness.

130
00:17:19,602 --> 00:17:21,593
All right, then.
Punish me.

131
00:17:26,575 --> 00:17:30,033
Your punishment is that till
I continue to read the book...

132
00:17:30,413 --> 00:17:31,937
...you should continue to
kiss me ceaselessly.

133
00:17:32,281 --> 00:17:33,714
I mean... sit quietly till then.

134
00:23:38,547 --> 00:23:41,948
- I don't like to meet secretly.
- I too don't like it too.

135
00:23:42,851 --> 00:23:44,512
But what can be done?
We are helpless.

136
00:23:45,054 --> 00:23:48,820
You see, at this stage, nobody should
know what's going on between us.

137
00:23:49,358 --> 00:23:51,326
If your daddy gets even an
inkling that...

138
00:23:51,994 --> 00:23:54,758
...you love an unemployed
and ordinary boy like me...

139
00:23:55,364 --> 00:23:58,094
...he would never forgive you,
nor would he ever accept me.

140
00:23:59,001 --> 00:24:02,129
Don't feel sad. Trust me.

141
00:24:02,871 --> 00:24:07,308
The day is not far when you
will become mine for ever.

142
00:24:08,577 --> 00:24:09,339
And then...

143
00:24:09,845 --> 00:24:14,339
But there's one thing... I don't like
your habit of coming late.

144
00:24:15,017 --> 00:24:15,813
Let me see your watch.

145
00:24:16,652 --> 00:24:21,680
My sister was to have come
today from Simla.

146
00:24:22,191 --> 00:24:23,249
I had to go to the airport too.

147
00:24:23,892 --> 00:24:26,156
It's too late now. She must've
even reached home by now.

148
00:24:43,011 --> 00:24:44,876
How many of you
Is their, Babulal?

149
00:24:46,448 --> 00:24:48,109
I am only one, Sister Gabbar.

150
00:24:48,650 --> 00:24:50,675
I mean how many servants are
there in this house?

151
00:24:51,286 --> 00:24:52,446
I will tell you right away.

152
00:24:54,990 --> 00:24:56,252
- Three.
- And you?

153
00:24:57,326 --> 00:24:59,260
- I am a man.
- You mean you are not a servant?

154
00:25:02,231 --> 00:25:04,290
Boss is always so concerned
about me that...

155
00:25:04,733 --> 00:25:06,360
...I forgot that I am a servant.

156
00:25:06,935 --> 00:25:09,301
You even forgot that the car
had to be sent to the airport?

157
00:25:09,571 --> 00:25:11,163
Why does one have to send
a car to the airport?

158
00:25:11,573 --> 00:25:13,200
There are airplanes at the
airport, aren't there?

159
00:25:15,911 --> 00:25:17,003
Did you hear?

160
00:25:20,015 --> 00:25:22,882
- Where's Daddy?
- He's passed away.

161
00:25:23,419 --> 00:25:24,386
What?

162
00:25:26,155 --> 00:25:30,592
He was travelling in a helicopter.
He was feeling chilly.

163
00:25:31,994 --> 00:25:34,394
So he switched off the fan
in the helicopter...

164
00:25:35,264 --> 00:25:37,289
...and then he vanished
from this world.

165
00:25:38,233 --> 00:25:41,100
- Whom are you talking about?
- About my father.

166
00:25:53,382 --> 00:25:55,043
- How are you?
- How are you?!

167
00:25:55,250 --> 00:25:57,878
I am fine. But I am
very angry with you.

168
00:25:58,253 --> 00:25:59,379
Why didn't you come to
receive me at the airport?

169
00:26:00,556 --> 00:26:01,784
I had extra classes today.

170
00:26:02,624 --> 00:26:04,717
All right. But at least
daddy could have come!

171
00:26:05,360 --> 00:26:07,954
You know how daddy is.
He is fond of just two things.

172
00:26:08,464 --> 00:26:10,591
One is to expand his business.
And second is to race cars.

173
00:26:11,333 --> 00:26:12,800
He must be busy in one
of these two activities.

174
00:26:13,569 --> 00:26:14,695
I don't want to hear anything.

175
00:26:15,204 --> 00:26:17,172
Our company's production should
increase at all costs.

176
00:26:17,439 --> 00:26:18,030
Yes, Sir.

177
00:26:18,373 --> 00:26:21,308
- Speak on, Mr. Mehta.
- The workers have appealed...

178
00:26:21,743 --> 00:26:23,233
...to the management that they
should be allotted houses to live.

179
00:26:23,712 --> 00:26:26,704
The company gives them employment
for which they receive salaries.

180
00:26:27,516 --> 00:26:30,508
Besides this, they won't get anything
else. You may leave now.

181
00:26:31,253 --> 00:26:33,721
Mr. Girdharilal's factory is
in our control now.

182
00:26:34,156 --> 00:26:35,180
Go and take charge.

183
00:26:35,491 --> 00:26:39,052
Henceforth, this company will be
known as Seema Garments.

184
00:26:40,729 --> 00:26:43,095
A lot of telephone calls have been
received from your residence.

185
00:26:43,765 --> 00:26:45,027
Miss Seema has returned from Simla.

186
00:26:48,103 --> 00:26:49,400
How is my daughter?

187
00:26:50,239 --> 00:26:53,231
- How are you?
- I am fine.

188
00:26:53,509 --> 00:26:55,909
- But I am in a foul mood.
- Why is your mood foul?

189
00:26:56,144 --> 00:26:58,612
- Why did you take so long?
- Because of urgent work at office.

190
00:26:59,448 --> 00:27:01,882
I have bought a new garment
factory for Seema.

191
00:27:03,452 --> 00:27:06,285
Now Seema Garments' name will become
a rage in the whole of Europe.

192
00:27:07,122 --> 00:27:08,214
And what about me?

193
00:27:09,024 --> 00:27:10,924
You? What do you want?

194
00:27:12,427 --> 00:27:15,419
That's all! A sports car?
All right, you will get it.

195
00:27:29,778 --> 00:27:31,973
- What is this?
- It's a soup.

196
00:27:32,314 --> 00:27:34,612
This is a soup?
It's a finger bowl.

197
00:27:35,484 --> 00:27:37,247
One washes one's hands in it
after eating the meals.

198
00:27:37,519 --> 00:27:39,282
What have you done?

199
00:27:39,855 --> 00:27:42,983
You've placed here something which
is used after meals are over.

200
00:27:43,592 --> 00:27:45,856
What if the boss had gulped it
down thinking it to be a soup?

201
00:27:46,094 --> 00:27:48,358
Quiet! Go and bring soup now!
You may also go!

202
00:27:55,070 --> 00:27:58,062
You won't go anywhere tomorrow.
You will stay with us.

203
00:27:58,473 --> 00:28:01,840
No! Instead, both of you will
come with me to Madras.

204
00:28:02,578 --> 00:28:04,808
I'm going to participate in
the car race for the final time.

205
00:28:05,247 --> 00:28:07,943
- But how can I come?
- Why?

206
00:28:08,617 --> 00:28:10,710
- I've my practical exams tomorrow.
- Oh yes!

207
00:28:11,286 --> 00:28:12,548
Your exams are important. But...

208
00:28:12,854 --> 00:28:15,482
It would've been great fun
if you had come too.

209
00:28:15,924 --> 00:28:19,792
Why do you think so? Take it from me.
Think of me to be close to you.

210
00:28:20,028 --> 00:28:22,861
Just see, father. Like always,
you'll win the race this time too.

211
00:28:30,872 --> 00:28:32,635
I hear this is the last time
you're participating in this race?

212
00:28:33,041 --> 00:28:36,442
Yes. Till I continue to participate,
nobody else will be able to win.

213
00:28:37,112 --> 00:28:39,273
Till the number one doesn't make way,
how will number two get the chance?

214
00:28:39,815 --> 00:28:41,248
That's fine. But it
might happen that...

215
00:28:41,450 --> 00:28:42,747
...number two gets the chance
this time itself!

216
00:28:44,019 --> 00:28:46,317
There's a new boy named
Vicky Malhotra.

217
00:28:47,255 --> 00:28:49,553
I've seen him practicing.
His timing is amazing.

218
00:28:50,626 --> 00:28:52,753
He's the one with whom you'll
have a stiff competition.

219
00:28:53,095 --> 00:28:55,893
- Where's he?
- There he is!

220
00:28:58,533 --> 00:29:00,228
Whether it's a car race or
a race in real-life...

221
00:29:00,502 --> 00:29:02,197
...I don't lose ever.
- Yes!

222
00:29:03,405 --> 00:29:05,270
Whether it's a Icky,
Micky, Licky or Chicky...

223
00:29:05,474 --> 00:29:08,204
...they are all pale in
comparison to my dad.

224
00:29:08,910 --> 00:29:10,104
What say, Dad?

225
00:29:36,038 --> 00:29:39,201
Mr. Madan Chopra is participating
in the race for the last time.

226
00:29:39,941 --> 00:29:42,569
On one hand is Madan Chopra's
experience...

227
00:29:49,017 --> 00:29:55,445
...and on the other hand
is Vicky Malhotra's confidence.

228
00:30:16,211 --> 00:30:19,271
Madan Chopra... his car is
nearly close to him...

229
00:30:20,415 --> 00:30:24,351
Now Madan Chopra is attempting
to overtake him...

230
00:30:26,021 --> 00:30:28,888
Vicky Malhotra's
self-confidence is...

231
00:31:04,526 --> 00:31:06,289
With full control over
his vehicle...

232
00:31:06,661 --> 00:31:08,822
...Vicky Malhotra has
overtaken Madan Chopra.

233
00:31:09,698 --> 00:31:12,292
Both, Vicky Malhotra and Madan Chopra
take the leads alternately.

234
00:31:50,038 --> 00:31:53,166
Looks like Vicky Malhotra will
set a new record...

235
00:31:53,675 --> 00:31:56,439
...and Madan Chopra will have
to concede defeat.

236
00:32:40,121 --> 00:32:41,520
I had nearly lost my breath!

237
00:32:42,023 --> 00:32:44,150
It was only when you raced ahead
at the last minute that...

238
00:32:44,392 --> 00:32:46,292
...number 32 was left wondering
about who he is dealing with.

239
00:32:48,697 --> 00:32:51,598
I want to meet the driver
of car number 32.

240
00:33:15,023 --> 00:33:16,513
Was there some technical
problem in your car?

241
00:33:16,858 --> 00:33:19,759
- No, Sir.
- Then how did you lose?

242
00:33:21,296 --> 00:33:24,595
I've been your fan since years.
I look upon you as my guru.

243
00:33:25,967 --> 00:33:28,162
I didn't want you to lose
the last race of your life.

244
00:33:28,803 --> 00:33:30,100
It means you lost deliberately?

245
00:33:31,706 --> 00:33:33,264
One has to lose something
to win something.

246
00:33:35,977 --> 00:33:37,069
What do you want to win?

247
00:33:38,046 --> 00:33:39,274
Your blessings.

248
00:33:41,182 --> 00:33:44,640
I like your style. By the way,
where you do hail from?

249
00:33:45,186 --> 00:33:47,814
From Bombay. Car racing
is my hobby.

250
00:33:48,590 --> 00:33:50,785
And it's my profession
to deal in racing cars.

251
00:33:52,727 --> 00:33:54,422
I've been on the look-out for a
sports car for my daughter.

252
00:33:55,163 --> 00:33:56,596
Let me know if there's
some nice car.

253
00:33:57,365 --> 00:33:58,696
I am reaching Bombay
day-after-tomorrow.

254
00:33:59,534 --> 00:34:01,229
I will show her a car
the moment I reach there.

255
00:34:02,404 --> 00:34:04,463
I want to click your picture
next to your car.

256
00:34:05,173 --> 00:34:06,367
Just a minute. I'll join you.

257
00:34:11,112 --> 00:34:12,204
I'll be in the club-house, daughter.

258
00:34:14,416 --> 00:34:15,610
Excuse me...

259
00:34:19,387 --> 00:34:21,617
- My name is...
- Priya Chopra.

260
00:34:23,325 --> 00:34:26,192
And you want to know why
I lost the race!

261
00:34:28,029 --> 00:34:29,257
For your sake.

262
00:34:31,766 --> 00:34:35,862
Didn't you say that all these Icky,
Micky, Licky or Chicky...

263
00:34:36,571 --> 00:34:38,232
...will prove to be pale in
comparison to your dad?

264
00:34:39,140 --> 00:34:42,735
And if this Icky, Micky, Licky
or Chicky were to win the race...

265
00:34:43,845 --> 00:34:45,005
...you would have
been heartbroken.

266
00:34:46,448 --> 00:34:48,780
And how could I break the heart
of a beautiful girl like you?

267
00:34:49,551 --> 00:34:55,683
That's why I said that to win
sometimes, one has to lose too.

268
00:34:57,826 --> 00:35:01,023
And one who wins after losing is
known as 'Baazigar'(a juggler).

269
00:35:07,569 --> 00:35:10,367
- What is such a person known as?
- A 'Baazigar'.

270
00:43:35,643 --> 00:43:36,974
Look! Your dress has
become so wet!

271
00:43:37,378 --> 00:43:39,573
You're talking of my dress.
But I've become so restless.

272
00:43:39,881 --> 00:43:41,178
Why? What's happened to you?

273
00:43:41,782 --> 00:43:46,549
Don't ask me anything. You may assume
that I've lost for the first time.

274
00:43:47,121 --> 00:43:49,021
It was daddy who took part in the
race. Then who defeated you?

275
00:43:49,724 --> 00:43:52,784
- The one who was defeated by daddy.
- Whom did daddy defeat?

276
00:43:53,094 --> 00:43:55,426
- The one who won me over.
- And who won you over?

277
00:43:56,697 --> 00:43:58,665
The one who lost with daddy though
he was on the verge of winning.

278
00:43:59,300 --> 00:44:01,894
Gosh! Did daddy win the
race or lose the race?

279
00:44:02,436 --> 00:44:04,529
Daddy won the race though he was
on the verge of losing.

280
00:44:04,939 --> 00:44:05,997
But I lost.

281
00:44:07,008 --> 00:44:08,441
You're talking in such
a confused manner.

282
00:44:08,809 --> 00:44:12,040
Why don't you tell me clearly
what exactly happened?

283
00:44:12,513 --> 00:44:14,276
It was a scintillating
competition.

284
00:44:14,882 --> 00:44:17,407
His gaze was like an arrow
which straight hit my heart...

285
00:44:17,919 --> 00:44:20,114
...and I was wounded.

286
00:44:21,889 --> 00:44:24,323
Whom are you talking about?
What's happened to you?

287
00:44:24,625 --> 00:44:25,751
I've fallen in love.

288
00:44:26,894 --> 00:44:30,489
- Gosh! You've fallen in love?
- Yes.

289
00:44:31,098 --> 00:44:33,532
And if you look at him, you will
fall from the 20th floor.

290
00:44:33,901 --> 00:44:35,300
I'm prepared to jump
from the 20th floor.

291
00:44:35,636 --> 00:44:38,503
- But let me have a glimpse of him.
- Not just a glimpse...

292
00:44:38,806 --> 00:44:39,864
I will even introduce you to him.

293
00:44:40,174 --> 00:44:41,539
He's coming tomorrow to
show me a sports car.

294
00:44:41,909 --> 00:44:45,106
- I will bring him to your college.
- All right. But bring him early.

295
00:44:45,446 --> 00:44:46,936
Tomorrow, I've to attend a
friend's birthday party too.

296
00:44:52,553 --> 00:44:54,145
Daddy will become mad when
he sees this car.

297
00:44:55,222 --> 00:44:56,314
I have also turned mad.

298
00:44:57,158 --> 00:44:59,718
If you like this car so much,
why are you giving it to daddy?

299
00:45:00,027 --> 00:45:03,292
Who's talking of the car?
Is this the age to love cars?

300
00:45:03,998 --> 00:45:07,161
This age is meant to fall in
love with beautiful girls.

301
00:45:17,311 --> 00:45:18,744
Seema will be glad to meet you today.

302
00:45:19,080 --> 00:45:20,342
We have to meet her at college
at one o'clock.

303
00:45:20,681 --> 00:45:22,774
I've praised about you
to her so much that...

304
00:45:23,017 --> 00:45:24,712
...she just went berserk.
I've told her that...

305
00:45:24,986 --> 00:45:27,887
...you're very handsome and that
you love in a unique style.

306
00:45:30,891 --> 00:45:32,324
How many cylinders does
this car have?

307
00:45:32,760 --> 00:45:33,692
Eight.

308
00:45:34,662 --> 00:45:35,890
It must be great fun
to drive it, isn't it?

309
00:45:36,163 --> 00:45:37,824
- Yes, it is.
- Shall I drive it?

310
00:45:38,099 --> 00:45:39,191
No, you can never drive it.

311
00:45:43,537 --> 00:45:45,505
- Stop the car.
- What happened?

312
00:45:46,540 --> 00:45:50,340
What happened?

313
00:45:52,880 --> 00:45:55,314
- So much noise for an ice-cream?
- Please fetch me one.

314
00:45:56,150 --> 00:45:59,085
- Ice-cream is not available here.
- In that case, I want coconut-water.

315
00:45:59,854 --> 00:46:02,789
All right. I will fetch
it for you right away.

316
00:46:05,626 --> 00:46:08,322
Please give me one ice-cream.
I mean... coconut-water. Hurry up.

317
00:46:08,629 --> 00:46:11,097
- I am going on a long drive.
- Yes, I am bringing it.

318
00:46:24,578 --> 00:46:28,639
- There's a girl behind!
- Don't let her overtake.

319
00:46:55,676 --> 00:46:59,237
Why did you block my way?
Come on! Move aside.

320
00:47:01,048 --> 00:47:02,640
You were driving the car
so excitedly, weren't you?

321
00:47:02,983 --> 00:47:04,450
Does the road belong
to your ancestors?

322
00:47:04,885 --> 00:47:09,720
Her speech is very spicy.
Let's see how she tastes.

323
00:47:12,626 --> 00:47:18,087
Where are you running away?
Let's catch her!

324
00:47:48,763 --> 00:47:49,821
How did you fall down?

325
00:47:50,765 --> 00:47:52,232
What happened? Did
the girl hit you?

326
00:47:52,500 --> 00:47:53,899
Not the girl... that boy
in the jacket hit me!

327
00:47:54,969 --> 00:47:57,369
What're we waiting for?
Let's get him.

328
00:48:05,279 --> 00:48:07,804
- The water is finished.
- Is it? What do you want now?

329
00:48:08,482 --> 00:48:09,346
The cream.

330
00:48:10,417 --> 00:48:12,009
As you wish!

331
00:48:20,728 --> 00:48:22,457
- The cream!
- Yes.

332
00:48:32,239 --> 00:48:33,331
There they are!

333
00:48:34,875 --> 00:48:35,933
Come on!

334
00:48:47,087 --> 00:48:49,612
How come you're in this condition?
Why don't you take something?

335
00:48:50,991 --> 00:48:53,824
Sometimes you jump from there,
or from here, or from up above...

336
00:48:59,466 --> 00:49:01,696
Look... this is a
place for love.

337
00:49:02,469 --> 00:49:05,165
You've come to love. And we have
come to take out your procession.

338
00:49:06,240 --> 00:49:07,605
I see... so you play
musical instruments!

339
00:49:07,875 --> 00:49:10,400
- Yes... no, of course, not!
- Why didn't you tell me earlier?

340
00:49:10,678 --> 00:49:13,408
Darling... these people
enjoy playing music.

341
00:49:13,781 --> 00:49:15,612
Why don't you sit
here for a while...

342
00:49:15,850 --> 00:49:18,080
...and let me take
care of them?

343
00:49:41,775 --> 00:49:43,003
Where did he go?

344
00:49:45,679 --> 00:49:46,839
Why don't you come too?

345
00:51:12,199 --> 00:51:13,564
Take this file to the court.

346
00:51:13,834 --> 00:51:15,062
Can I make a phone call
to Commissioner Uncle?

347
00:51:15,302 --> 00:51:16,894
Are you the Commissioner's niece?

348
00:51:17,504 --> 00:51:19,972
Let me make a phone call first.
Then you will get to know.

349
00:51:20,174 --> 00:51:24,440
You've made the Commissioner
your Uncle to impress a constable?

350
00:51:27,181 --> 00:51:29,877
It's you, Karan!

351
00:51:31,051 --> 00:51:34,817
You look smart in the uniform!

352
00:51:36,957 --> 00:51:39,289
This is Karan. We studied
together in Simla.

353
00:51:44,765 --> 00:51:47,097
- I was going and these crooks...
- I've understood.

354
00:51:48,469 --> 00:51:49,629
They must've surely
teased you.

355
00:51:50,804 --> 00:51:53,170
I'll deal with them later.
Please come in.

356
00:51:54,074 --> 00:51:55,871
Some other time. As it is,
we've been delayed.

357
00:51:57,011 --> 00:51:59,479
You'd better hurry up. Seema must be
waiting for us in the college.

358
00:52:00,414 --> 00:52:02,780
It's 3 o'clock already. She was to
have to gone to her friend's party.

359
00:52:03,417 --> 00:52:04,441
She must've gone by now.

360
00:52:22,669 --> 00:52:24,728
Come on... open your mouth.
A little bigger.

361
00:52:25,539 --> 00:52:26,836
Just a little more...

362
00:53:37,978 --> 00:53:38,842
I cannot come.

363
00:53:49,289 --> 00:53:50,449
I cannot leave them
and come to you.

364
00:53:51,291 --> 00:53:52,451
Why don't you call him inside?

365
00:53:53,293 --> 00:53:55,818
- Whom should I call in?
- The one whom you are signaling to.

366
00:53:59,166 --> 00:54:02,397
I was only calling Charlie
to dance with me.

367
00:54:05,639 --> 00:54:07,504
He got the connection
with great difficulty.

368
00:54:12,146 --> 00:54:13,204
I am coming over.

369
00:54:44,845 --> 00:54:47,814
Tell me something. Why didn't
you come inside the party?

370
00:54:49,683 --> 00:54:54,313
You know that I don't like to mix
with your affluent friends.

371
00:54:54,855 --> 00:54:58,791
I came up to the door
only to inform you that...

372
00:54:58,992 --> 00:55:00,186
...l'm going home
for a few days.

373
00:55:00,661 --> 00:55:02,424
What? What will I do all
the while you are away?

374
00:55:03,063 --> 00:55:03,893
Oh yes!

375
00:55:04,765 --> 00:55:07,199
Yes! You make do with
that Charlie!

376
00:55:08,635 --> 00:55:10,102
Why are you angry?
I was only joking.

377
00:55:10,470 --> 00:55:12,028
Come on... let's go and treat
ourselves to some delicacies.

378
00:55:12,806 --> 00:55:14,398
I'm warning you strictly.

379
00:55:15,909 --> 00:55:18,002
The boy who was supposed to have
come to see Miss Seema...

380
00:55:18,478 --> 00:55:19,502
...he has already arrived.

381
00:55:20,480 --> 00:55:24,314
But you lowly people shouldn't
come in his presence.

382
00:55:26,386 --> 00:55:29,446
Besides the Chopra house, even my
image will be ruined. Understand?

383
00:55:30,891 --> 00:55:33,086
And today, I will be making
a special tea.

384
00:55:33,660 --> 00:55:35,924
Special tea for special occasions.

385
00:55:36,863 --> 00:55:39,991
After drinking it, the boy will give
his consent for marriage immediately.

386
00:55:40,767 --> 00:55:44,134
And it will be me who
will make that tea.

387
00:55:45,239 --> 00:55:50,006
Has your father ever
made tea?

388
00:55:50,577 --> 00:55:53,375
Don't mention my father.
He used to make coffee.

389
00:55:55,148 --> 00:55:56,046
Get me the hat.

390
00:56:00,787 --> 00:56:03,381
Today, I will make tea
flavored with saffron.

391
00:56:04,324 --> 00:56:05,814
It's not saffron.
It is turmeric.

392
00:56:06,560 --> 00:56:07,993
You are in a great hurry.
Shut up, fatso!

393
00:56:16,703 --> 00:56:19,035
He's making a mess of things here.

394
00:56:19,806 --> 00:56:21,501
Over there, the guests are waiting
for the tea to be served.

395
00:56:23,477 --> 00:56:25,638
You see... I've only one son.

396
00:56:26,146 --> 00:56:28,273
Whatever I have belongs to him.

397
00:56:30,317 --> 00:56:33,718
I've three factories. I make all
kinds of plastic items.

398
00:56:34,254 --> 00:56:37,189
If you ever need buckets, mugs
or tumblers for bathing...

399
00:56:37,524 --> 00:56:39,014
...let me know immediately.

400
00:56:41,361 --> 00:56:42,885
- Wait, Babulal.
- Shut up!

401
00:56:44,064 --> 00:56:45,725
And none of you should
come outside. Understand?

402
00:56:48,902 --> 00:56:51,700
He has taken boiled water
to be served.

403
00:56:52,172 --> 00:56:54,902
He didn't even mix tea leaves.
Instead, he has mixed salt.

404
00:56:56,643 --> 00:57:00,340
He's my son.
He's my only son.

405
00:57:01,114 --> 00:57:02,138
Mr. Singhania has telephoned.

406
00:57:03,784 --> 00:57:06,378
- Please drink tea. I'll be back.
- Please go. Business comes first.

407
00:57:06,820 --> 00:57:09,380
If Mr. Singhania needs
buckets or tumblers...

408
00:57:09,890 --> 00:57:11,824
...do suggest my name to him.

409
00:57:12,359 --> 00:57:13,383
Make tea quickly.

410
00:57:13,894 --> 00:57:17,694
My son has studied in
the United States.

411
00:57:18,465 --> 00:57:22,094
If you wish, you may speak to him
in English and assure yourself.

412
00:57:25,105 --> 00:57:26,072
My son!

413
00:57:27,407 --> 00:57:28,806
My son!

414
00:57:32,079 --> 00:57:33,671
- What is it?
- There are no tea leaves in it.

415
00:57:36,249 --> 00:57:38,809
Affluent people make such tea.
Drink it quickly.

416
00:57:47,627 --> 00:57:48,821
Tea leaves!

417
00:57:50,197 --> 00:57:51,494
Tea leaves!

418
00:58:59,933 --> 00:59:00,922
Please come.

419
00:59:01,601 --> 00:59:02,932
Did you drink tea or not?

420
00:59:03,236 --> 00:59:07,730
The tea of your home is like
nectar. What say, Son?

421
00:59:12,245 --> 00:59:13,041
Seema has come!

422
00:59:14,948 --> 00:59:15,812
Come, let me give you a surprise.

423
00:59:16,116 --> 00:59:17,708
- What surprise?
- Come along first.

424
00:59:21,455 --> 00:59:22,183
Come, Seema.

425
00:59:22,656 --> 00:59:26,490
She's Seema, my daughter. And he's
Mr. Bajoria, and this is his son.

426
00:59:26,893 --> 00:59:28,451
Hello, daughter.

427
00:59:29,663 --> 00:59:34,726
Both of them make a good pair.
Now just give your nod for marriage.

428
00:59:36,837 --> 00:59:41,297
All right. Let's hold the engagement
ceremony sometime next week.

429
00:59:44,678 --> 00:59:48,205
Try to understand my problem.

430
00:59:49,649 --> 00:59:53,608
You know, don't you, that I don't
have any status or position...

431
00:59:53,887 --> 00:59:56,014
...that I can come over to your dad
and speak about marriage with him.

432
00:59:56,423 --> 01:00:00,689
I don't know anything. If you
can't, I will speak with him.

433
01:00:01,495 --> 01:00:04,123
I will tell him everything about
you and convince him.

434
01:00:04,598 --> 01:00:07,260
- But...
- We have just one week left.

435
01:00:07,934 --> 01:00:10,027
Daddy has fixed my engagement
for next week.

436
01:00:13,373 --> 01:00:17,833
All right. Meet me tomorrow.
I will find some way out.

437
01:00:49,643 --> 01:00:51,270
You may marry wherever
your Daddy wants you to.

438
01:00:54,447 --> 01:00:55,243
What are you saying?

439
01:00:57,517 --> 01:00:58,484
I've given it a lot of thought.

440
01:01:01,588 --> 01:01:03,112
We've no other way.

441
01:01:04,758 --> 01:01:06,555
I don't want any way.
I want the destination.

442
01:01:08,094 --> 01:01:10,028
And you are my destination.

443
01:01:12,032 --> 01:01:13,624
I cannot live without you.

444
01:01:15,502 --> 01:01:17,265
In that case, we have
just one choice left...

445
01:01:19,205 --> 01:01:20,934
...which can unite us forever.

446
01:01:21,775 --> 01:01:22,537
What's that?

447
01:01:27,514 --> 01:01:30,278
- Suicide.
- Suicide?

448
01:01:32,652 --> 01:01:33,914
Are you willing?

449
01:01:38,825 --> 01:01:41,123
If death is the destination
of our love...

450
01:01:41,695 --> 01:01:43,390
...then I am prepared
to die gladly.

451
01:01:45,799 --> 01:01:49,257
I, Ajay Sharma, am writing
this in full consciousness...

452
01:01:50,570 --> 01:01:53,437
I, Seema Chopra, am writing
this in full consciousness...

453
01:01:53,907 --> 01:01:58,071
...that without any coercion,
having been fed up of life...

454
01:01:58,979 --> 01:02:01,504
...that without any coercion,
having been fed up of life...

455
01:02:02,515 --> 01:02:03,914
...I am committing suicide.

456
01:02:04,250 --> 01:02:05,376
...I am committing suicide.

457
01:02:06,519 --> 01:02:09,147
- Nobody is to be blamed for this.
- Nobody is to be blamed for this.

458
01:02:11,291 --> 01:02:12,315
Sign it now.

459
01:02:24,904 --> 01:02:26,701
What happened? Why
are you laughing?

460
01:02:27,507 --> 01:02:28,804
Because you've passed.

461
01:02:29,576 --> 01:02:36,675
Yes! I was only testing you!

462
01:02:37,484 --> 01:02:39,918
I was testing your love,
your faith.

463
01:02:41,888 --> 01:02:43,082
What about this suicide note?

464
01:02:45,492 --> 01:02:46,823
Only cowards commit suicide.

465
01:02:48,728 --> 01:02:52,528
And I am not a coward so as
to give up so easily.

466
01:02:54,300 --> 01:02:58,999
You reach at the Registrar's
Office at 1 o'clock sharp.

467
01:02:59,839 --> 01:03:01,306
I will wait for you there.

468
01:03:02,742 --> 01:03:03,834
Are you happy now?

469
01:08:58,464 --> 01:08:59,362
Closed between 1 and 2 p.m.

470
01:08:59,999 --> 01:09:02,467
See? You were delayed and
it is lunch time now.

471
01:09:02,969 --> 01:09:04,163
How would I have known that...

472
01:09:04,404 --> 01:09:06,372
...everybody in this office
feels hungry between 1 and 2 p. M?

473
01:09:08,007 --> 01:09:11,135
What should we do for half an hour
now? What if somebody sees us here?

474
01:09:12,445 --> 01:09:16,313
What can we do? Let them eat food.
We will go for a walk somewhere.

475
01:09:36,369 --> 01:09:37,597
Our marriage is so strange!

476
01:09:39,205 --> 01:09:41,799
Neither is there any procession,
nor any celebrations.

477
01:09:45,211 --> 01:09:47,702
Listen... tell me something.

478
01:09:49,849 --> 01:09:52,249
What is the gift that
a husband gives...

479
01:09:52,485 --> 01:09:54,248
...to his wife the first
thing after the wedding?

480
01:09:54,687 --> 01:09:58,282
What is that?

481
01:09:58,858 --> 01:10:02,089
I knew that you would forget.
That's why I've brought it.

482
01:10:05,064 --> 01:10:06,156
Look what's inside it.

483
01:10:12,638 --> 01:10:16,267
It's very beautiful. Just like you.

484
01:10:16,742 --> 01:10:18,642
- Is it?
- Do you know, Seema?

485
01:10:19,545 --> 01:10:21,843
I feel like placing you on
the top of the skies.

486
01:10:23,149 --> 01:10:24,081
Like this!

487
01:10:24,951 --> 01:10:26,509
Hey! What are you doing?
I suffer from vertigo.

488
01:10:27,019 --> 01:10:28,714
I feel dizzy to look
down from heights.

489
01:10:29,288 --> 01:10:30,448
Please take me down.
I am feeling scared.

490
01:10:32,859 --> 01:10:34,827
Now that you've held my hand,
why do you have to feel scared?

491
01:10:37,763 --> 01:10:39,754
I'm mad that I am taking
you away from your world.

492
01:10:41,434 --> 01:10:45,336
Every girl has to start a new life
after leaving her own world.

493
01:10:51,344 --> 01:10:53,335
And the girl walks on these
beautiful feet...

494
01:10:55,248 --> 01:10:59,708
...and liberates herself
from her old ties for ever.

495
01:11:02,288 --> 01:11:03,585
I am freeing you.

496
01:11:07,193 --> 01:11:08,285
Please forgive me.

497
01:12:16,229 --> 01:12:17,958
Leave me. Leave me.

498
01:12:24,136 --> 01:12:25,728
Please leave me.

499
01:12:27,740 --> 01:12:29,765
Leave me.

500
01:13:13,786 --> 01:13:15,447
I am sorry about Seema's death.

501
01:13:16,656 --> 01:13:18,886
Can you spare some time
in private?

502
01:13:19,625 --> 01:13:21,058
Yes, please come.

503
01:13:29,669 --> 01:13:33,435
Till now we believed that Seema
fell from that building...

504
01:13:33,939 --> 01:13:36,373
...or she was pushed down.
But the truth is that...

505
01:13:37,009 --> 01:13:38,738
...she committed suicide.

506
01:13:43,582 --> 01:13:44,981
Seema committed suicide?

507
01:13:47,086 --> 01:13:48,144
How can it be?

508
01:13:55,861 --> 01:13:57,328
Do you recognize
this handwriting?

509
01:14:01,200 --> 01:14:02,394
This is written by Seema.

510
01:14:04,804 --> 01:14:05,964
But how can it be?

511
01:14:07,206 --> 01:14:09,834
On that day,
she was so happy!

512
01:14:10,976 --> 01:14:14,969
And if she had any grief,
she would've surely told me.

513
01:14:15,681 --> 01:14:19,913
I am her sister. I know her well.
Seema cannot do this.

514
01:14:20,953 --> 01:14:24,047
Seema can never commit suicide.

515
01:14:25,124 --> 01:14:26,352
Seema cannot do like this.

516
01:14:27,460 --> 01:14:28,927
Seema cannot do it.

517
01:14:45,745 --> 01:14:48,305
I think there's no
scope for any doubt.

518
01:14:49,915 --> 01:14:52,475
If you wish, we will
continue the enquiry.

519
01:14:54,019 --> 01:14:55,509
Otherwise, we will
close the case.

520
01:14:57,189 --> 01:14:58,713
You may do as you please.

521
01:15:01,527 --> 01:15:02,892
I've already lost my daughter.

522
01:15:41,233 --> 01:15:43,724
- Why doesn't it enter inside?
- Keep on trying. It will go.

523
01:15:51,544 --> 01:15:57,744
This nail doesn't belong to this
wall. It belongs on that wall.

524
01:16:54,974 --> 01:16:55,736
What is it?

525
01:16:57,309 --> 01:17:00,107
- Is there someone at home?
- What a question!

526
01:17:00,880 --> 01:17:02,541
You blind man! Just put this on!
Who am I here?

527
01:17:03,115 --> 01:17:07,211
- Who are you?
- I am Prem Nath.

528
01:17:08,654 --> 01:17:09,746
So shall I start dancing then?

529
01:17:11,056 --> 01:17:15,550
We've stopped giving charity.
Get lost from here.

530
01:17:17,196 --> 01:17:19,562
I wonder where from
these people come from.

531
01:17:21,133 --> 01:17:23,897
Why are you screaming?
What happened?

532
01:17:24,403 --> 01:17:26,530
I wonder where from they come
to ask for charity.

533
01:17:26,872 --> 01:17:29,306
- I threw him out of the house.
- You did a wise thing.

534
01:17:44,456 --> 01:17:47,220
Greetings. I've come from
Bhimchand Jewellers.

535
01:17:48,093 --> 01:17:49,321
Is Miss Seema here?

536
01:17:52,431 --> 01:17:55,525
Tell me, what is it?
I am her sister.

537
01:17:56,268 --> 01:17:57,997
She had come to our shop
a few days ago.

538
01:17:58,270 --> 01:18:01,000
- She has to pay for some bills.
- What for?

539
01:18:01,674 --> 01:18:03,073
She had bought
a mangalsutra necklace.

540
01:18:06,078 --> 01:18:07,272
- A Mangalsutra?
- Yes.

541
01:18:10,182 --> 01:18:11,911
Looks like you're mistaken.

542
01:18:12,351 --> 01:18:14,182
But she had given the
address of this place.

543
01:18:14,820 --> 01:18:17,152
Look, this is the bill.

544
01:18:27,066 --> 01:18:29,193
- What?
- I was telling you...

545
01:18:29,468 --> 01:18:30,662
...before itself that Seema
didn't commit suicide.

546
01:18:31,103 --> 01:18:34,266
Looks like the boy she wanted
to marry has murdered her.

547
01:18:35,174 --> 01:18:37,404
Please request the Commissioner
and start the enquiry again.

548
01:18:50,289 --> 01:18:53,588
No... there's no need
for an enquiry.

549
01:18:54,994 --> 01:18:56,291
If Seema has been murdered...

550
01:18:56,695 --> 01:18:58,925
...would you let go the killer
without him being punished?

551
01:18:59,865 --> 01:19:01,230
The killer would be
punished much later.

552
01:19:01,934 --> 01:19:04,801
Have you ever considered what
punishment we would go through?

553
01:19:05,738 --> 01:19:09,469
It's such a shameful thing
that Madan Chopra's daughter...

554
01:19:10,309 --> 01:19:12,038
...used to love someone secretly...

555
01:19:12,911 --> 01:19:14,936
...that she was planning to
marry someone secretly.

556
01:19:15,881 --> 01:19:18,111
This story is published
in the press...

557
01:19:18,417 --> 01:19:20,749
...if everybody talks about
it in a juicy manner...

558
01:19:21,253 --> 01:19:22,845
...I would lose my face.

559
01:19:23,656 --> 01:19:25,920
Who would marry you?
Have you ever given it a thought?

560
01:19:26,959 --> 01:19:29,257
No... Seema is dead.

561
01:19:30,429 --> 01:19:32,954
Let the pain of Seema's death
remain in your heart.

562
01:19:33,932 --> 01:19:36,059
We cannot let it spoil
our reputation.

563
01:20:04,863 --> 01:20:06,592
No, I won't come up.
I feel scared.

564
01:20:07,099 --> 01:20:10,091
What's there to be scared of?
It's just six feet high.

565
01:20:11,403 --> 01:20:14,531
No. I feel dizzy when
I look down from heights.

566
01:20:36,662 --> 01:20:38,596
What's the matter? Why
did you call me here?

567
01:20:39,798 --> 01:20:41,891
Seema didn't commit suicide.

568
01:20:42,701 --> 01:20:43,793
How can you be so sure...

569
01:20:44,369 --> 01:20:46,735
...though you've seen her handwritten
suicide note yourself?

570
01:20:47,239 --> 01:20:49,070
Because she had purchased a
mangalsutra necklace.

571
01:20:50,075 --> 01:20:54,034
Yes. And a day later,
Seema fell down from here.

572
01:20:54,546 --> 01:20:56,537
And there's a marriage bureau
in this building.

573
01:20:57,049 --> 01:20:59,813
It's possible that she must've
come here to marry some boy...

574
01:21:00,252 --> 01:21:04,484
...and that boy proved to be
a cheat and he pushed her.

575
01:21:05,958 --> 01:21:08,051
Let's assume that the
boy pushed Seema.

576
01:21:09,528 --> 01:21:12,520
But the question is... why did
Seema want to marry him secretly?

577
01:21:14,500 --> 01:21:15,467
Secondly...

578
01:21:16,268 --> 01:21:18,793
One needs to apply one month in
advance for a registered marriage.

579
01:21:19,404 --> 01:21:20,393
I've already checked the register.

580
01:21:20,906 --> 01:21:23,568
There's no application in the name of
Seema Chopra at the marriage bureau.

581
01:21:24,810 --> 01:21:28,302
And thirdly, we didn't find any
mangalsutra in Seema's purse.

582
01:21:29,248 --> 01:21:33,116
Now you tell me, did she come here
to marry, or to commit suicide?

583
01:21:34,052 --> 01:21:37,078
If she wanted to commit suicide,
she could've shot herself...

584
01:21:37,422 --> 01:21:41,916
...or consumed poison. But she could
never have jumped from a height.

585
01:21:43,495 --> 01:21:45,463
Because Seema was scared of heights.

586
01:21:46,665 --> 01:21:48,963
She used to feel dizzy
when she saw from a height.

587
01:21:51,537 --> 01:21:54,973
She couldn't even jump from a height
of six feet in a swimming pool.

588
01:21:58,443 --> 01:22:01,901
The enquiry is over. I cannot
help you in any way now.

589
01:22:02,447 --> 01:22:05,883
Help me to track down
Seema's killer.

590
01:22:07,553 --> 01:22:09,612
Nobody is helping me
at this point of time.

591
01:22:13,592 --> 01:22:16,857
All right. I cannot do
anything officially.

592
01:22:18,030 --> 01:22:20,157
But I am prepared to help
you in my personal capacity.

593
01:22:21,066 --> 01:22:22,897
Now do as I say.

594
01:22:24,269 --> 01:22:28,035
You'll have to first ascertain
who all Seema met.

595
01:22:29,274 --> 01:22:32,334
I had even asked Seema about the
boy who she was in love with.

596
01:22:33,245 --> 01:22:35,179
But she put off the
question saying...

597
01:22:35,447 --> 01:22:36,607
...that she would tell me
at the right time.

598
01:22:37,382 --> 01:22:39,748
But there is surely someone
who she was in love with...

599
01:22:40,018 --> 01:22:41,178
...whom she wanted to marry.

600
01:22:42,287 --> 01:22:44,949
Do you suspect any one who
could have been her boyfriend?

601
01:22:46,058 --> 01:22:47,548
I don't know about outside
the college.

602
01:22:48,060 --> 01:22:49,994
But within the college,
she was friendly with Ravi.

603
01:22:51,496 --> 01:22:53,088
- Who's Ravi?
- He's our classmate.

604
01:22:55,133 --> 01:22:57,863
Can you tell me where
I can find Ravi?

605
01:22:58,203 --> 01:23:00,194
You will find him at the
library in the evening.

606
01:23:17,289 --> 01:23:18,517
You are suspecting me needlessly.

607
01:23:19,691 --> 01:23:23,718
I did love Seema. And I also
believed that she loved me too.

608
01:23:24,763 --> 01:23:26,788
But my misunderstanding was
cleared the day when I saw her...

609
01:23:27,165 --> 01:23:29,429
...in some other boy's
company in the garden.

610
01:23:30,369 --> 01:23:31,267
Other boy?

611
01:23:32,638 --> 01:23:34,902
- Who was he?
- I don't know him.

612
01:23:35,874 --> 01:23:39,469
Yes, I had clicked some photographs
on Anjali's birthday party.

613
01:23:40,379 --> 01:23:42,176
He is there in one
of the pictures.

614
01:23:42,948 --> 01:23:44,882
- Where is that photo?
- In my hostel.

615
01:23:45,484 --> 01:23:49,420
- I will get it for you tomorrow.
- No! I want that photograph now.

616
01:24:02,501 --> 01:24:04,731
You stay here. I will go upstairs
and get the photographs.

617
01:24:04,970 --> 01:24:06,062
- I will come too.
- No!

618
01:24:06,705 --> 01:24:08,764
This is a boy's hostel.
So you can't come upstairs.
