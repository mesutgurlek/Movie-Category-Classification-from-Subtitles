1
00:00:18,989 --> 00:00:22,459
Slow down for a minute,
will you, please, Jenkins?

2
00:01:15,509 --> 00:01:17,579
All right. Go ahead. Thank you.

3
00:01:38,149 --> 00:01:40,788
- Where are we, Jenkins?
- Fifth Avenue, sir.

4
00:01:40,949 --> 00:01:46,148
- I see that. But why are we here?
- This is your wedding anniversary.

5
00:01:46,309 --> 00:01:50,860
Oh, of course, of course, my 15th.
Delightful occasion.

6
00:01:51,029 --> 00:01:52,701
Thank you, Jenkins.

7
00:01:56,229 --> 00:01:59,027
- Good morning, Mr. Cortland.
- I'd like to get a bracelet.

8
00:01:59,189 --> 00:02:02,784
Diamond, of course. Here we are.

9
00:02:03,749 --> 00:02:09,665
Is this something like we have
in mind? Or perhaps this?

10
00:02:11,709 --> 00:02:14,223
Oh, that's beautiful.

11
00:02:14,429 --> 00:02:17,421
- I'll take that.
- Fine. That's my preference.

12
00:02:17,589 --> 00:02:19,068
Will there be anything else?

13
00:02:19,229 --> 00:02:24,587
No, thank you. Oh, yes, I wanna get
something for my wife too.

14
00:02:30,909 --> 00:02:32,581
- How much is this?
- Seven dollars.

15
00:02:32,749 --> 00:02:34,626
Will you put this in one
of your boxes?

16
00:02:34,789 --> 00:02:37,462
- Yes.
- Incidentally, what is it?

17
00:02:37,629 --> 00:02:42,020
- It's a Chinese backscratcher.
- Always wanted to have one of those.

18
00:02:42,189 --> 00:02:44,862
- Shall we send it, sir?
- No, I'll give it to her myself.

19
00:02:45,029 --> 00:02:47,463
- And about the bracelet, sir.
- I want that engraved.

20
00:02:47,629 --> 00:02:49,779
Yes, and to whom?

21
00:02:49,949 --> 00:02:53,783
To my dear, sweet...

22
00:02:56,629 --> 00:03:00,907
- May I use your telephone, please?
- Of course, right over there.

23
00:03:01,709 --> 00:03:04,269
I'll have her name for you
in just a minute.

24
00:03:07,389 --> 00:03:12,224
- The boss wants you on the phone.
- Thanks. I'm through with this table, Joe.

25
00:03:12,389 --> 00:03:15,142
Someone's still a beat off.

26
00:03:16,829 --> 00:03:20,504
- Hello, chief.
- What's the name of that pretty girl...

27
00:03:20,669 --> 00:03:24,059
...in the front line
of the modern group?

28
00:03:24,229 --> 00:03:28,108
The new one with
the dimples on her knee?

29
00:03:28,509 --> 00:03:32,343
Oh, Sheila Winthrop.
Yeah, that's right.

30
00:03:40,189 --> 00:03:43,226
- Miss Winthrop.
- Yes, Mr. Curtis.

31
00:03:43,389 --> 00:03:45,698
There's nothing I admire more
than independence...

32
00:03:45,869 --> 00:03:47,860
...but sometimes
it can be carried too far.

33
00:03:48,109 --> 00:03:51,499
Our group is known
for absolute precision.

34
00:03:51,669 --> 00:03:55,025
All the other girls are doing
this dance one way and you another.

35
00:03:55,189 --> 00:03:58,226
I'm sorry. But I don't know
that part of the routine.

36
00:03:58,429 --> 00:04:01,068
- Would you like to try it with me?
- I'd love to.

37
00:04:01,229 --> 00:04:03,824
Tommy, let's have the second 24 bars.
Ready? One and two and...

38
00:04:03,859 --> 00:04:06,419
Tommy, let's have the second 24 bars.
Ready? One and two and...

39
00:04:38,069 --> 00:04:41,061
- That's much better, thank you.
- Thank you.

40
00:04:41,429 --> 00:04:44,102
All right, now listen, kids.
I want the whole number.

41
00:04:44,269 --> 00:04:47,818
Places, please.
It's "Boogie Barcarolle," from the top.

42
00:04:47,989 --> 00:04:50,628
I'll do it with you. Are you ready?

43
00:04:51,109 --> 00:04:55,546
Music. Now, give me some
nice straight lines, please. Go.

44
00:06:35,069 --> 00:06:38,379
That's it. Take five minutes.

45
00:06:38,949 --> 00:06:40,701
Sheila.

46
00:06:41,109 --> 00:06:44,499
- Who do you think you're kidding?
- I don't know what you mean.

47
00:06:44,669 --> 00:06:48,105
- You know that dance routine.
- That's right.

48
00:06:48,269 --> 00:06:50,942
Then why do you muff it
when Mr. Curtis is around?

49
00:06:51,109 --> 00:06:53,828
- Because I like to dance with him.
- Is that all?

50
00:06:54,669 --> 00:06:56,944
- I like the way he talks.
- Is that all?

51
00:06:57,109 --> 00:06:59,464
- I like his personality.
- Is that all?

52
00:06:59,629 --> 00:07:03,508
- Isn't that enough?
- Don't get your hopes up, dear.

53
00:07:03,669 --> 00:07:06,183
- Why not?
- For eight hours a day, Mr. Curtis...

54
00:07:06,349 --> 00:07:09,580
...is up to his hips in pretty girls.
And we all look alike to him.

55
00:07:09,749 --> 00:07:12,661
- Really?
- Yes. To a hungry man, a lamb chop...

56
00:07:12,829 --> 00:07:16,583
...is a tasty dish. But to
the butcher, it's just a hunk of meat.

57
00:07:16,749 --> 00:07:19,263
Mr. Cortland wants to see you
in his office.

58
00:07:19,429 --> 00:07:22,341
- I take it all back, dear.
- Thank you, Mr. Curtis.

59
00:07:22,509 --> 00:07:24,803
- What do you take back, Marge?
- A remark I made about lamb chops.

60
00:07:24,838 --> 00:07:27,098
- What do you take back, Marge?
- A remark I made about lamb chops.

61
00:07:46,949 --> 00:07:48,098
Come in.

62
00:07:53,149 --> 00:07:56,539
- You sent for me, Mr. Cortland?
- Yes, I thought we might have a chat.

63
00:07:56,709 --> 00:07:58,825
- Won't you sit down, please?
- Thank you.

64
00:08:02,109 --> 00:08:05,704
- You know that I own this theatre?
- Yes, I do.

65
00:08:05,869 --> 00:08:07,939
Fine. Fine.

66
00:08:09,029 --> 00:08:12,783
- I took an interest in your work.
- Really?

67
00:08:12,989 --> 00:08:16,299
So much so that this morning
I was walking down Fifth Avenue...

68
00:08:16,469 --> 00:08:19,347
...I saw something rather beautiful
that reminded me of you.

69
00:08:19,509 --> 00:08:23,024
I wanted you to have it very much,
and so I bought it for you.

70
00:08:23,429 --> 00:08:26,387
This couldn't be a diamond bracelet,
could it?

71
00:08:26,549 --> 00:08:28,858
Yes, as a matter of fact, it's engraved.

72
00:08:29,029 --> 00:08:31,862
"To my dear, sweet Sheila."
Something I thought of.

73
00:08:32,029 --> 00:08:35,624
- How lovely.
- We do understand each other, don't we?

74
00:08:35,789 --> 00:08:37,780
- Yes, we do, don't we?
- Good.

75
00:08:40,189 --> 00:08:43,499
Now, I've got a little plan.

76
00:08:44,389 --> 00:08:45,822
I'm sorry.

77
00:08:48,029 --> 00:08:50,827
- Hello?
- Mrs. Cortland is on her way in.

78
00:08:51,029 --> 00:08:52,906
Thank you, Cummings.

79
00:08:53,709 --> 00:08:56,701
- I'm terribly sorry about this.
- I quite understand.

80
00:08:56,869 --> 00:08:58,780
Maybe this way would be better.

81
00:08:58,949 --> 00:09:01,668
- You are lovely, my dear.
- Thank you, Mr. Cortland.

82
00:09:01,829 --> 00:09:03,308
Oh, thank you, Miss Winthrop.

83
00:09:03,469 --> 00:09:05,778
We'll consider the proposition
closed then.

84
00:09:07,349 --> 00:09:10,705
I'm thinking of putting
her under long-term contract.

85
00:09:10,869 --> 00:09:14,418
She's an old friend of the family.
My family.

86
00:09:14,589 --> 00:09:17,387
Her father and my father, you know.
Like that:

87
00:09:18,269 --> 00:09:20,737
- She's beautiful, isn't she?
- Who?

88
00:09:20,909 --> 00:09:24,902
Oh, she? In a superficial sort of way.

89
00:09:26,949 --> 00:09:28,746
Will you stop looking at me like that?

90
00:09:28,909 --> 00:09:31,662
- Like what?
- You ought to know, you're doing it.

91
00:09:32,309 --> 00:09:35,142
Do we have to fight
on our wedding anniversary?

92
00:09:35,309 --> 00:09:39,143
- How did you happen to remember that?
- Well, Jenkins told me.

93
00:09:39,309 --> 00:09:40,583
Very thoughtful of Jenkins.

94
00:09:40,709 --> 00:09:43,177
I was thoughtful too.
I bought you a present.

95
00:09:43,349 --> 00:09:46,864
It's in my coat pocket, if you
wanna go and look for it.

96
00:09:58,789 --> 00:10:03,340
Oh. Oh, it's lovely, Martin.

97
00:10:03,549 --> 00:10:06,461
- Interesting gadget, isn't it?
- Gadget?

98
00:10:06,629 --> 00:10:09,939
- Yes, it's to scratch your back.
- Scratch your back?

99
00:10:10,109 --> 00:10:13,545
Yes, it's Chinese. You scratch it up
and down and crosswise.

100
00:10:13,709 --> 00:10:15,586
What on earth are you talking about?

101
00:10:15,749 --> 00:10:18,582
Oh, wait a minute,
I'll show you how it works.

102
00:10:19,909 --> 00:10:23,788
- Where did you get that?
- Out of your pocket.

103
00:10:23,949 --> 00:10:27,942
- My dear, there has been a mistake.
- I see. Who is "dear, sweet Sheila"?

104
00:10:28,109 --> 00:10:30,782
The girl that just went out.
Don't jump to conclusions.

105
00:10:30,949 --> 00:10:33,668
No, no, I won't.
We'll take it nice and easy.

106
00:10:33,829 --> 00:10:35,342
But, Julia, you do not understand.

107
00:10:35,509 --> 00:10:38,228
No, I know I don't, dear.
But I will when you explain.

108
00:10:38,389 --> 00:10:42,780
- I bought that for Robert Curtis.
- Should look lovely on him.

109
00:10:42,989 --> 00:10:45,901
Don't be ridiculous.
Robert is crazy about Miss Winthrop.

110
00:10:46,069 --> 00:10:50,824
He asked me to pick a present out
for her. So I did. See?

111
00:10:51,029 --> 00:10:54,738
I'm disappointed in you. There was
a time when your alibis were gems.

112
00:10:54,949 --> 00:10:58,385
- Remember the Russian dancer?
- She was Portuguese.

113
00:10:58,549 --> 00:11:01,780
Before you talked your way out of that,
you rewrote the Arabian Nights.

114
00:11:01,909 --> 00:11:03,501
Now you've lost your imagination.

115
00:11:03,629 --> 00:11:05,381
I'm getting bored with you.

116
00:11:05,549 --> 00:11:09,383
Bored? Is it my fault you reached
into the wrong pocket?

117
00:11:09,549 --> 00:11:13,667
You started the whole thing. That's
the trouble around here, no privacy.

118
00:11:13,829 --> 00:11:16,787
People reaching into wrong pockets.
No organization.

119
00:11:16,949 --> 00:11:18,667
How's a man to run a theatre?

120
00:11:18,829 --> 00:11:21,821
- Is this what you intended for me?
- Yes.

121
00:11:21,989 --> 00:11:25,220
As a matter of fact, you know,
that's quite a collector's item.

122
00:11:25,389 --> 00:11:28,745
Ming dynasty.
But it also has its practical side.

123
00:11:28,909 --> 00:11:31,423
You can scratch yourself
in all sorts of places.

124
00:11:31,589 --> 00:11:32,624
I imagine.

125
00:11:32,789 --> 00:11:37,101
Oh, you're very thoughtful, Martin.
I'm sure Miss Winthrop will agree.

126
00:11:37,269 --> 00:11:38,497
You don't believe me then?

127
00:11:38,669 --> 00:11:41,581
Oh, of course I do.
But that's because I know you so well.

128
00:11:41,749 --> 00:11:45,708
I'm just wondering how your story
will sound to 12 strange men.

129
00:11:46,829 --> 00:11:51,664
Twelve strange men.
Twelve strange men. She's batty.

130
00:11:52,589 --> 00:11:58,425
What's 12 strange men got to do
with this? Football team, 11 men.

131
00:11:58,589 --> 00:12:01,422
A baseball team, nine.

132
00:12:01,829 --> 00:12:06,186
Symphony orchestra, 100 men.

133
00:12:06,349 --> 00:12:08,658
Twelve men.

134
00:12:12,029 --> 00:12:14,623
A jury!

135
00:12:16,989 --> 00:12:21,028
Robert, prepare yourself for a shock.
Julia's going to divorce me.

136
00:12:21,229 --> 00:12:23,982
- I'll be first to congratulate her.
- How can you say that?

137
00:12:24,149 --> 00:12:27,459
You know I don't want a divorce.
I'm happily married. I love my wife.

138
00:12:27,629 --> 00:12:29,904
And besides,
all this property is in her name.

139
00:12:30,069 --> 00:12:32,583
She's gonna strip me right down
to my underwear too.

140
00:12:32,749 --> 00:12:35,217
You ought to think of that
before you gallop after...

141
00:12:35,429 --> 00:12:38,307
...something you can't catch.
Who is it this time?

142
00:12:38,469 --> 00:12:42,382
Sheila Winthrop. I bought her this,
and my wife found it in my pocket.

143
00:12:42,549 --> 00:12:44,779
I imagine you had a good reason
for buying that.

144
00:12:44,949 --> 00:12:47,383
- I certainly did. We're good friends.
- Oh, I see.

145
00:12:47,549 --> 00:12:50,268
- Besides, it's none of your business.
- I agree with you.

146
00:12:50,469 --> 00:12:54,781
- Wait, you're in this too, you know.
- Me? What have I to do with it?

147
00:12:54,949 --> 00:12:58,544
I told Julia you bought this for Sheila
and that you were in love with her.

148
00:12:58,709 --> 00:13:01,860
Oh, you did, did you?
I'm going to tell her differently.

149
00:13:02,029 --> 00:13:04,259
You don't have to.
She doesn't believe it anyway.

150
00:13:04,469 --> 00:13:05,948
Please, you've got to help me.

151
00:13:06,109 --> 00:13:08,828
If you get me out of this jam,
it'll never happen again.

152
00:13:08,989 --> 00:13:12,140
No more galloping, I swear it.
Please, Robert?

153
00:13:12,309 --> 00:13:15,540
- All right, what do you want me to do?
- Well, it's very simple.

154
00:13:15,709 --> 00:13:18,746
I'll take Julia to the Crystal Roof
for our anniversary dinner.

155
00:13:18,909 --> 00:13:23,027
You bring Sheila and prove to my wife
that you are in love with Sheila.

156
00:13:23,189 --> 00:13:25,862
What? Well, what would Sheila think?

157
00:13:26,029 --> 00:13:28,702
Make her believe it too.
If she doesn't, Julia won't.

158
00:13:28,869 --> 00:13:31,781
That won't be difficult.
She has a friendly disposition.

159
00:13:31,949 --> 00:13:34,986
Turn on the old charm, you know.
Fascinate her.

160
00:13:35,149 --> 00:13:37,379
Do anything so long as you
make my wife...

161
00:13:37,549 --> 00:13:40,017
...believe I was telling the truth
when I lied to her.

162
00:13:40,189 --> 00:13:41,224
Is that all?

163
00:13:41,389 --> 00:13:45,860
If you get a chance, you might put in
a good word for me with Sheila.

164
00:14:03,509 --> 00:14:05,420
Hello.

165
00:14:05,549 --> 00:14:07,187
I said, hello.

166
00:14:07,309 --> 00:14:09,504
Oh, hello.

167
00:14:10,789 --> 00:14:13,826
I'm sorry. For a minute,
I was a long way off.

168
00:14:13,989 --> 00:14:16,025
- Have a nice trip?
- Wonderful.

169
00:14:16,189 --> 00:14:21,422
I'm glad you came back.
Incidentally, you dance beautifully.

170
00:14:21,589 --> 00:14:24,979
- You didn't think so at rehearsal.
- Oh, that.

171
00:14:25,149 --> 00:14:29,108
Confidentially, Sheila, I'm delighted
every time you make a mistake.

172
00:14:29,269 --> 00:14:30,987
I get a chance to dance with you.

173
00:14:31,149 --> 00:14:35,347
Confidentially, I make mistakes
for the same reason.

174
00:14:37,349 --> 00:14:39,419
Good evening, Mr. Cortland.

175
00:14:41,229 --> 00:14:42,867
What are you looking for?

176
00:14:43,029 --> 00:14:45,702
Me? Nothing.
Why should I be looking for anything?

177
00:15:03,589 --> 00:15:06,149
- Thanks, Sheila. It was lovely.
- That's your fault.

178
00:15:06,509 --> 00:15:08,147
Look! There are Robert and Sheila.

179
00:15:08,309 --> 00:15:10,539
- Oh, how surprising.
- Let's go over and say hello.

180
00:15:10,709 --> 00:15:13,177
Just to be polite.
Just for a minute.

181
00:15:13,349 --> 00:15:16,546
- Oh, Robert.
- Hello, Martin. Hello, Julia.

182
00:15:16,709 --> 00:15:18,540
- Well, this is a surprise.
- Is it?

183
00:15:18,709 --> 00:15:20,301
- Of course it is.
- Want to sit down?

184
00:15:20,469 --> 00:15:23,461
Thank you. That's nice of you.
We have a table over here.

185
00:15:23,629 --> 00:15:27,668
Way back is the best we could get.
I hope we're not gonna crowd you.

186
00:15:27,829 --> 00:15:30,263
Sheila, how rude of me.
You know Miss Winthrop, Julia?

187
00:15:30,429 --> 00:15:33,262
- Yes. How do you do, Miss Winthrop?
- How do you do?

188
00:15:33,469 --> 00:15:35,903
It was outside of my husband's office,
wasn't it?

189
00:15:36,389 --> 00:15:40,667
I'm glad you both dropped by.
I was just about to...

190
00:15:40,829 --> 00:15:42,467
- You first, Robert.
- Thank you.

191
00:15:42,629 --> 00:15:44,699
I was gonna say,
I'm glad you both dropped by.

192
00:15:44,869 --> 00:15:47,099
It makes a very pleasant occasion
even more so.

193
00:15:47,309 --> 00:15:50,187
Yes, doesn't it? And it's our
15th wedding anniversary too.

194
00:15:50,349 --> 00:15:52,226
- Congratulations.
- Thank you.

195
00:15:52,389 --> 00:15:55,347
Robert, did you happen to see
the lovely present Martin gave me?

196
00:15:55,549 --> 00:15:59,178
- It was a backscratcher, Chinese.
- Ming dynasty. Ming.

197
00:15:59,349 --> 00:16:02,944
When we were first married, it was
orchids. Now it's a backscratcher.

198
00:16:03,109 --> 00:16:06,499
Try and scratch your back
with an orchid, I always say.

199
00:16:06,669 --> 00:16:09,103
It seems to be a special occasion
for both of us.

200
00:16:09,269 --> 00:16:12,261
How did you like your present,
my dear?

201
00:16:12,709 --> 00:16:14,381
What present do you mean?

202
00:16:15,269 --> 00:16:17,464
That's a funny thing about orchids.

203
00:16:17,629 --> 00:16:21,463
I was talking to a guy the other day
who breeds... Raises orchids.

204
00:16:21,629 --> 00:16:23,142
He said he couldn't do...

205
00:16:23,349 --> 00:16:27,627
You gotta make so much difference
about the yellow ones. But...

206
00:16:27,789 --> 00:16:30,542
Martin, what in the world
are you doing?

207
00:16:31,109 --> 00:16:34,658
- I'm tying my shoe.
- Try doing it with both hands.

208
00:16:35,589 --> 00:16:39,377
- Well, what were we talking about?
- The present Robert gave Miss Winthrop.

209
00:16:39,589 --> 00:16:41,466
Julia, can't you keep a secret?

210
00:16:41,629 --> 00:16:45,622
I was saving this as a surprise,
but now that you know it...

211
00:16:45,789 --> 00:16:47,347
...I hope you like it.

212
00:16:50,309 --> 00:16:53,699
- This couldn't be a diamond bracelet?
- Open it.

213
00:17:00,149 --> 00:17:02,299
"To my dear, sweet Sheila."

214
00:17:03,229 --> 00:17:06,778
The funny thing was that when my wife
found that in my pocket...

215
00:17:06,949 --> 00:17:09,827
...she thought that I was the one
who bought it for you.

216
00:17:11,989 --> 00:17:14,184
How could you possibly think
such a thing?

217
00:17:14,389 --> 00:17:16,300
Because I know Martin.

218
00:17:16,509 --> 00:17:18,704
Do you like it, Sheila?

219
00:17:19,349 --> 00:17:24,742
Like it? It's wonderful. It's the most
gorgeous thing I ever saw!

220
00:17:27,829 --> 00:17:30,627
Now what do you think,
Miss Susie Suspicious?

221
00:17:30,789 --> 00:17:31,904
Ask me later.

222
00:17:32,109 --> 00:17:36,182
Oh, Mr. Curtis, this is the nicest thing
that ever happened to me.

223
00:17:37,629 --> 00:17:41,099
- May I call you Robert?
- Please do.

224
00:17:41,269 --> 00:17:44,306
Oh, I'm so deliriously happy.
I don't know what to do!

225
00:17:44,469 --> 00:17:48,098
Oh, yes I do! I'm going
to phone all my relatives.

226
00:17:53,229 --> 00:17:55,265
- Sheila!
- Mr. Cortland...

227
00:17:55,429 --> 00:17:58,023
...who is that with Mr. Curtis?
- Miss Sheila Winthrop.

228
00:17:58,149 --> 00:18:01,824
- Oh, Winthrop. A romance?
- Yes. They're practically engaged.

229
00:18:01,989 --> 00:18:04,139
You can quote her as
being deliriously happy.

230
00:18:04,309 --> 00:18:08,382
- Thank you.
- Ming dynasty.

231
00:18:11,389 --> 00:18:16,782
"New romance in show world.
Robert Curtis and Sheila Winthrop."

232
00:18:16,949 --> 00:18:18,038
And then it goes on:

233
00:18:18,109 --> 00:18:20,828
"The announcement will be a surprise
to the many friends...

234
00:18:20,989 --> 00:18:23,549
...of the famous choreographer
who is directing...

235
00:18:23,709 --> 00:18:26,621
...the numbers for the modern revue
at the Cortland Theatre."

236
00:18:26,789 --> 00:18:28,586
What else does it say, Louise?

237
00:18:28,829 --> 00:18:32,617
That's about all, except you are
quoted as being "deliriously happy."

238
00:18:32,789 --> 00:18:34,666
Who do you suppose
put that in the paper?

239
00:18:34,869 --> 00:18:38,020
Mr. Curtis, naturally.
And that's carrying things too far.

240
00:18:38,189 --> 00:18:41,226
You'd think he'd quit
after what I did to him last night.

241
00:18:41,509 --> 00:18:44,706
- Did he know you were doing it?
- Of course.

242
00:18:44,869 --> 00:18:47,224
He must have known
I was trying to embarrass him.

243
00:18:47,389 --> 00:18:50,028
Apparently that newspaper article
was to even things up.

244
00:18:50,189 --> 00:18:54,182
- How do you know it was him?
- I'd believe anything of him.

245
00:18:54,349 --> 00:18:56,909
I thought I liked him once.
Now I know the gentleman.

246
00:18:58,949 --> 00:19:01,622
Hello? Who?

247
00:19:01,789 --> 00:19:06,465
Tom! Of course she is.
It's your captain.

248
00:19:09,789 --> 00:19:12,667
Tom, dear, where are you?

249
00:19:13,109 --> 00:19:16,021
You mean to say you left
the Army to run itself?

250
00:19:16,229 --> 00:19:19,744
I've been transferred to Camp Weston
near where my mother lives.

251
00:19:19,909 --> 00:19:22,548
I was going to ask you and
Louise to visit us for a while.

252
00:19:22,829 --> 00:19:25,946
That sounds delightful.
Why don't you?

253
00:19:26,149 --> 00:19:29,107
That was before I read
this morning's paper.

254
00:19:29,669 --> 00:19:33,787
You mean it isn't so?
There's still a chance for me?

255
00:19:34,349 --> 00:19:36,340
Fine! I'll be right up!

256
00:19:44,869 --> 00:19:48,066
Hey! Why don't you watch
where you're going?

257
00:20:00,829 --> 00:20:05,027
You're the first driver who chased a man
after he'd already missed him.

258
00:20:05,189 --> 00:20:07,862
- Hey, buddy, who's car is that?
- Mine.

259
00:20:08,029 --> 00:20:10,907
Parked it right next
to a fire hydrant.

260
00:20:11,469 --> 00:20:13,027
That wasn't there when I parked!

261
00:20:13,189 --> 00:20:15,783
Oh, I'm sure it wasn't.
Every time it rains...

262
00:20:15,949 --> 00:20:18,941
...those fireplugs pop out of
the sidewalk like mushrooms.

263
00:20:21,229 --> 00:20:23,345
What's your name?

264
00:20:27,789 --> 00:20:29,620
Put it over here.

265
00:20:32,029 --> 00:20:35,226
Let that be a lesson to you.

266
00:20:36,549 --> 00:20:39,017
And that's what happened.
It was all part of a game.

267
00:20:39,189 --> 00:20:41,498
I see. This Curtis fella pitched
and you caught.

268
00:20:41,669 --> 00:20:44,627
Before the party broke up,
she did some pitching of her own.

269
00:20:44,789 --> 00:20:46,666
- I'd say the score was even.
- I wouldn't.

270
00:20:47,949 --> 00:20:52,465
Hello? Who is it?
Oh, just a minute, please.

271
00:20:52,629 --> 00:20:55,826
Mr. Robert Curtis is in the lobby.
Should I tell him to go away?

272
00:20:55,989 --> 00:20:59,220
No, tell him to come up.
It'll save me a trip to the theatre.

273
00:20:59,429 --> 00:21:01,738
Will you come up, Mr. Curtis?

274
00:21:02,589 --> 00:21:04,386
He sounded upset.

275
00:21:04,549 --> 00:21:07,905
- I'd like to really upset him.
- You would?

276
00:21:08,069 --> 00:21:10,344
You two wait in the other room.
I'll handle this.

277
00:21:10,509 --> 00:21:12,545
All right, come along, Tom.

278
00:21:19,109 --> 00:21:20,667
Come in.

279
00:21:24,309 --> 00:21:27,381
- What about this story in the paper?
- What about it?

280
00:21:27,549 --> 00:21:30,427
You took a lot for granted
announcing we were engaged.

281
00:21:30,589 --> 00:21:34,582
- You're saying you didn't announce it?
- I certainly am. Why would I?

282
00:21:34,749 --> 00:21:36,899
What would I gain
by such a ridiculous story?

283
00:21:38,749 --> 00:21:41,946
That's the fella who almost hit me
on the street. Do you have a gun?

284
00:21:42,109 --> 00:21:43,701
But how can we get rid of his body?

285
00:21:43,869 --> 00:21:46,542
- Never mind that. Just give me the gun.
- All right.

286
00:21:47,829 --> 00:21:50,502
- Here.
- Oh.

287
00:21:51,269 --> 00:21:55,342
I don't care who put it in the paper
as long as you know we're not engaged.

288
00:21:55,509 --> 00:21:57,340
May I compliment you on your chivalry.

289
00:21:57,509 --> 00:22:01,661
I imagine the bracelet will more
than make up for your hurt feelings.

290
00:22:01,869 --> 00:22:05,225
- I'm going in and you can't keep me!
- No, no, Tom!

291
00:22:05,389 --> 00:22:08,586
Stand aside, I know my duty.

292
00:22:09,269 --> 00:22:11,703
- You, sir.
- Tom!

293
00:22:11,869 --> 00:22:14,337
- What are you doing here?
- I came to attend a wedding.

294
00:22:14,509 --> 00:22:15,578
There's gonna be one.

295
00:22:15,789 --> 00:22:18,428
I tried to keep him out.
You know your brother's temper.

296
00:22:18,589 --> 00:22:20,659
But, brother, dear,
you don't understand.

297
00:22:20,869 --> 00:22:24,066
Yes, I do. I heard every word he said,
the dirty, no-good Yankee!

298
00:22:24,229 --> 00:22:27,062
- Say, what's this all about?
- Honour, sir. My sister's honour!

299
00:22:27,269 --> 00:22:30,261
- All I did was give her a bracelet.
- You admit you bought it?

300
00:22:30,429 --> 00:22:32,067
- I didn't buy it.
- Then you stole it?

301
00:22:32,229 --> 00:22:34,618
No, somebody gave it to me,
and I gave it to her.

302
00:22:34,789 --> 00:22:37,223
You did that and you still refuse
to marry her, sir?

303
00:22:37,389 --> 00:22:40,620
- I said we are not engaged!
- That's all I want to hear.

304
00:22:40,789 --> 00:22:42,905
- Sheila!
- Darling.

305
00:22:55,989 --> 00:22:58,787
- Yes?
- Sorry, Mr. Cortland. No news yet.

306
00:22:58,949 --> 00:23:02,464
Fine thing! I own the theatre.
I shoulder all the responsibilities.

307
00:23:02,629 --> 00:23:05,587
I pay all the salaries.
I ask one simple question.

308
00:23:05,749 --> 00:23:08,104
I wanna find out how much
Robert Curtis weighs.

309
00:23:08,269 --> 00:23:10,260
- And what's the answer?
- I don't know.

310
00:23:12,749 --> 00:23:17,265
- I'm about to be sued, shot or sabotaged.
- Who's gonna do all this?

311
00:23:17,429 --> 00:23:20,182
Sheila's brother has some silly notion
about me and Sheila.

312
00:23:20,349 --> 00:23:22,260
He's after me with the biggest gun ever.

313
00:23:22,389 --> 00:23:25,028
- It's just a badger game.
- Just a badger game.

314
00:23:25,189 --> 00:23:27,384
It serves you right
for getting mixed up with women.

315
00:23:27,549 --> 00:23:29,301
Serves me right? You caused it all!

316
00:23:29,469 --> 00:23:32,745
Don't try to implicate me in your
sordid affairs. I'm a married man.

317
00:23:32,909 --> 00:23:35,628
This is serious. You've got
to help me out of this mess.

318
00:23:35,789 --> 00:23:37,268
The fella is gonna shoot me.

319
00:23:37,429 --> 00:23:40,626
- Lf he shoots you, I'll fire Sheila.
- That'll be a big help.

320
00:23:40,789 --> 00:23:42,780
Then get a gun
and shoot right back at him.

321
00:23:42,949 --> 00:23:44,860
I should call the district attorney.

322
00:23:45,029 --> 00:23:48,624
Get this theatre mixed up in a scandal?
No, I'm in trouble enough already.

323
00:23:48,789 --> 00:23:52,338
- Robert, they're gonna draft you.
- Draft me? How do you know?

324
00:23:52,509 --> 00:23:55,626
I found this. You're to report
to the Medical Board this afternoon.

325
00:23:55,789 --> 00:23:59,338
- Everything happens to me.
- Drafted. Wow!

326
00:23:59,509 --> 00:24:03,627
- I beg your pardon?
- That's the solution to my problems.

327
00:24:03,789 --> 00:24:07,418
Don't be selfish. I can't run
this theatre without you. Think of me.

328
00:24:07,589 --> 00:24:10,183
I've had enough of you, your theatre
and your schemes.

329
00:24:10,349 --> 00:24:13,182
- Besides, the Army needs me.
- Oh, not as much as I need you.

330
00:24:13,349 --> 00:24:15,783
What makes you so sure
you can pass that examination?

331
00:24:15,949 --> 00:24:17,667
- How much do you weigh?
- I don't know.

332
00:24:17,829 --> 00:24:21,663
We'll soon find out. We'll get you
on these scales in here, my boy.

333
00:24:21,869 --> 00:24:24,588
We'll settle this right now.

334
00:24:24,789 --> 00:24:27,826
Just as I thought, five pounds
underweight. My troubles are over.

335
00:24:27,989 --> 00:24:31,299
- No five pounds are holding me back.
- I'm going with you.

336
00:24:31,469 --> 00:24:33,539
Oh, no, you're not.

337
00:24:56,189 --> 00:24:58,749
- Next man, corporal.
- Yes, sir.

338
00:24:59,589 --> 00:25:01,864
Robert Curtis.

339
00:25:11,429 --> 00:25:12,942
Everything's fine so far.

340
00:25:13,109 --> 00:25:15,543
Now all we have to do is check
your height and weight.

341
00:25:15,709 --> 00:25:19,907
- Take off your hat.
- I'm sorry, sir, I just had a shampoo.

342
00:25:20,069 --> 00:25:21,980
- Take off your hat!
- Yes, sir.

343
00:25:25,389 --> 00:25:26,788
Stop that jiggling.

344
00:25:26,949 --> 00:25:29,463
I must've caught a chill.
If I could put my hat on.

345
00:25:29,629 --> 00:25:31,347
No hat. Stand still.

346
00:25:34,269 --> 00:25:38,467
Yes. Now? All right.

347
00:25:38,629 --> 00:25:42,508
- Do you think you can you stand still?
- Yes, sir, I'm okay now, doc.

348
00:25:42,669 --> 00:25:45,388
That's funny, I'd have said
you were five pounds under.

349
00:25:45,549 --> 00:25:47,267
I fool them all, doc.

350
00:25:47,469 --> 00:25:50,939
All right. Report to Camp Weston.
You'll leave from Grand Central Station.

351
00:25:51,149 --> 00:25:52,741
Thanks a lot, doc.

352
00:25:55,709 --> 00:26:00,305
You say Little Neck, Long Neck,
Great Neck, Connecticut.

353
00:26:00,469 --> 00:26:03,188
All I wanna know is when my brother,
she's arrive.

354
00:26:03,349 --> 00:26:05,943
I'm sorry, but I don't understand
what you wanna know.

355
00:26:06,109 --> 00:26:07,542
He's not so smart.

356
00:26:07,709 --> 00:26:11,418
- Can you please give me information?
- Thank goodness you speak English.

357
00:26:11,589 --> 00:26:15,138
We're going to Camp Weston.
Would it be better to take a train...

358
00:26:15,309 --> 00:26:18,381
...and go to Cattaras, or make
a change and go from there?

359
00:26:18,549 --> 00:26:20,904
Why, yes, I... What was that again?

360
00:26:21,069 --> 00:26:26,302
Is it better to take a train to Cattaras,
or would it be better in the morning?

361
00:26:26,469 --> 00:26:27,584
I don't understand you.

362
00:26:27,749 --> 00:26:30,217
I'll put it another way.
We're going to Camp Weston.

363
00:26:30,389 --> 00:26:31,663
- You understand that?
- Yes.

364
00:26:31,829 --> 00:26:35,139
Is it better to take a train
and go all the way to Cattaras...

365
00:26:35,309 --> 00:26:37,379
...or be forced to take
the midnight special?

366
00:26:37,549 --> 00:26:40,063
- Shall I repeat that?
- No, please, don't.

367
00:26:42,069 --> 00:26:45,220
- Where are you going?
- I wanna get one of these folders.

368
00:26:45,389 --> 00:26:49,621
- I'll see you later.
- How long does it take to Camp Weston?

369
00:26:49,789 --> 00:26:52,098
Okay, soldier.
Take a train and go to Cattaras.

370
00:26:52,269 --> 00:26:54,908
You'll find this fighter force
and get there on time.

371
00:26:55,069 --> 00:26:57,537
- How's that again?
- I said take a train to Cattaras.

372
00:26:57,709 --> 00:27:00,428
Don't change, find a place in the centre.
You'll find it a lot sooner.

373
00:27:00,709 --> 00:27:03,940
Oh, you mean...
In plenty of time.

374
00:27:04,149 --> 00:27:06,265
No, l... What did you say?

375
00:27:06,469 --> 00:27:10,257
I said, I thought you said they probably
have it near Camp Weston...

376
00:27:10,389 --> 00:27:12,186
...especially on Tuesdays.

377
00:27:12,909 --> 00:27:14,627
A comedian, huh?

378
00:27:44,469 --> 00:27:47,984
Farewell, our hero

379
00:27:48,149 --> 00:27:50,026
Well. Hi, Francis.

380
00:27:50,189 --> 00:27:51,417
Slave driver sublime

381
00:27:51,589 --> 00:27:53,898
I don't believe it. Hi, Jerry.

382
00:27:54,069 --> 00:27:56,503
Don't be like Nero
And fiddle away your time

383
00:27:56,669 --> 00:27:57,988
Who, me?

384
00:27:58,189 --> 00:28:01,625
If ever you're lonely

385
00:28:01,789 --> 00:28:04,747
Just remember this
Please do

386
00:28:04,909 --> 00:28:06,786
You're the best of rookies

387
00:28:06,949 --> 00:28:12,182
And your sweet cookies
Are proud of you

388
00:28:12,349 --> 00:28:15,819
Thank you, thank you
Why I'm completely floored

389
00:28:16,029 --> 00:28:17,542
- All aboard.
- All aboard.

390
00:28:17,709 --> 00:28:19,222
All aboard

391
00:28:19,389 --> 00:28:22,665
Goodbye, dear friends of mine
My dancing troupe divine

392
00:28:22,829 --> 00:28:26,219
Suzetta, you should be next to Jean
Janetta, you're not in line

393
00:28:26,389 --> 00:28:29,301
To go, I hate, but, girls, I've got a date

394
00:28:29,469 --> 00:28:33,223
I'm shooting the works for Uncle Sam

395
00:28:33,389 --> 00:28:36,665
No crying, Marge and Myrt
You need a girdle, Gert

396
00:28:36,829 --> 00:28:40,617
And promise me please to write, Louise
And give me the latest dirt

397
00:28:40,829 --> 00:28:43,218
I'm off, my queens
To learn some new routines

398
00:28:43,389 --> 00:28:47,587
I'm shooting the works for Uncle Sam

399
00:28:47,749 --> 00:28:50,786
North, South, East, West
All the boys are hep

400
00:28:50,949 --> 00:28:54,498
To do their darnedest
To defend Miss Liberty's rep

401
00:28:54,669 --> 00:28:57,422
Cheer them both, for even though
They're slightly out of step

402
00:28:57,589 --> 00:29:01,707
They're shooting the works
They're shooting the works

403
00:29:01,909 --> 00:29:06,346
Yes, ma'am
They're shooting the works for Uncle Sam

404
00:29:56,829 --> 00:29:59,946
Cheer them both, for even though
They're slightly out of step

405
00:30:00,109 --> 00:30:05,137
They're shooting the works for Uncle Sam

406
00:30:46,389 --> 00:30:49,347
Halt!

407
00:30:54,269 --> 00:30:59,263
All right. All right. Now.

408
00:30:59,429 --> 00:31:01,863
Who's making patty-cake with the feet?

409
00:31:02,029 --> 00:31:06,307
- Was it you?
- Why, sergeant.

410
00:31:06,469 --> 00:31:08,824
- You?
- Wasn't me.

411
00:31:09,789 --> 00:31:12,986
- Were you doing it?
- Doing what?

412
00:31:14,669 --> 00:31:18,139
- That.
- Oh, you mean this?

413
00:31:18,669 --> 00:31:24,141
Say, you're not bad.
But don't do it again!

414
00:31:24,309 --> 00:31:26,459
The supply officer wants
to see you right away.

415
00:31:26,629 --> 00:31:28,620
- I'll be right with you.
- Right.

416
00:31:28,789 --> 00:31:31,223
Any of you men have
any experience drilling?

417
00:31:31,389 --> 00:31:34,665
- I have.
- March the detail to the drill field.

418
00:31:34,829 --> 00:31:38,299
Hey, buddy, come here.
Put this in my tent.

419
00:31:40,509 --> 00:31:43,069
Right shoulder arms!

420
00:31:45,509 --> 00:31:48,182
Right face. Forward march.

421
00:31:49,189 --> 00:31:51,419
Backward march.

422
00:31:52,789 --> 00:31:56,259
Halt! Right face, forward march.

423
00:31:56,429 --> 00:31:59,307
Backward march.
Right turn and face me slowly.

424
00:31:59,469 --> 00:32:02,586
Left. In the rear right.
Back. Forward.

425
00:32:02,789 --> 00:32:04,745
About face.

426
00:32:04,949 --> 00:32:07,463
Right. Set apart. Left face.

427
00:32:07,629 --> 00:32:09,506
Forward. Halt!

428
00:32:13,349 --> 00:32:16,068
Look, do I have to keep telling you
to go to the right...

429
00:32:16,229 --> 00:32:19,665
...when I want you to go to the banks?
Don't counter it. Go.

430
00:32:21,309 --> 00:32:23,664
Forward march.

431
00:32:24,389 --> 00:32:27,381
On the double.

432
00:32:27,549 --> 00:32:31,303
- On the double.
- On the double.

433
00:32:31,469 --> 00:32:33,903
Now you're getting it.
Razzle-dazzle.

434
00:32:35,429 --> 00:32:37,989
Halt!

435
00:32:38,149 --> 00:32:41,664
I thought you said you had
some experience in drilling.

436
00:32:41,829 --> 00:32:44,787
I did. I used to work
for the city. Street department.

437
00:32:45,669 --> 00:32:47,580
Back in the ranks!

438
00:33:02,789 --> 00:33:05,861
- What's the matter?
- Can't a guy get some sleep here?

439
00:33:06,029 --> 00:33:09,305
It's that Curtis guy again.
Why don't you go to bed?

440
00:33:09,469 --> 00:33:11,460
Get some sleep.

441
00:33:14,629 --> 00:33:16,904
Quiet!

442
00:33:27,789 --> 00:33:30,906
Hey, Swivel Tongue, you got a match?
I can't find my sleeping pills.

443
00:33:31,069 --> 00:33:32,787
I'll get you a light.

444
00:33:41,909 --> 00:33:45,299
Hey. I borrowed your flashlight.

445
00:33:45,469 --> 00:33:50,418
- I said...
- Oh.

446
00:33:51,509 --> 00:33:53,306
Oh, there they are.

447
00:33:55,429 --> 00:33:57,659
Hey, you can't take those
without a chaser.

448
00:33:57,829 --> 00:33:59,740
Give me that cup.
I'll get you some water.

449
00:33:59,909 --> 00:34:02,059
Oh, thanks, Swiv.

450
00:34:05,229 --> 00:34:07,220
What's the matter with you?

451
00:34:07,389 --> 00:34:11,860
- Quiet, fellas.
- Why don't you be quiet.

452
00:34:19,149 --> 00:34:21,060
Hi, buddy.
What are you doing there?

453
00:34:21,229 --> 00:34:26,064
I'm just getting some water...

454
00:34:26,229 --> 00:34:27,423
Oh.

455
00:34:30,149 --> 00:34:31,662
Watch.

456
00:34:47,349 --> 00:34:49,067
Thanks, Swiv.

457
00:34:49,909 --> 00:34:51,865
I tripped.

458
00:34:56,029 --> 00:34:59,465
- I brought you back your flashlight.
- What?

459
00:34:59,629 --> 00:35:02,427
- Your face is wet.
- Oh, go away and let me alone.

460
00:35:02,589 --> 00:35:07,140
I was only trying to...
I brought back...

461
00:35:09,149 --> 00:35:11,140
Ow!

462
00:35:15,709 --> 00:35:19,145
Hey! I borrowed your flashlight again.

463
00:35:20,989 --> 00:35:24,140
- What happened?
- I sat on this. It was in my bed.

464
00:35:26,029 --> 00:35:29,863
- "You left town so quickly..."
- Go away, will you? Go on.

465
00:35:32,029 --> 00:35:34,099
Hey, Swiv. Swiv, where are you?

466
00:35:34,309 --> 00:35:36,459
- I don't know. I'm in the dark.
- Quiet!

467
00:35:36,629 --> 00:35:38,699
Come here.
Let's have that light, will you?

468
00:35:40,149 --> 00:35:42,868
"I didn't get to give
this back to you.

469
00:35:43,029 --> 00:35:46,339
Inasmuch as I refused it when
Mr. Cortland tried to give it to me...

470
00:35:46,509 --> 00:35:49,421
...I see no reason
why I should take it from you.

471
00:35:49,589 --> 00:35:50,738
Sheila Winthrop.

472
00:35:50,909 --> 00:35:53,981
P.S. May I compliment
you again on your..."

473
00:35:54,149 --> 00:35:58,586
- Chivalry.
- "Chivalry." Who's Sheila Winthrop?

474
00:35:59,029 --> 00:36:03,784
I didn't realize it before,
but she is a very sweet young lady.

475
00:36:10,469 --> 00:36:14,348
That's the first time I ever heard
of a rabbit giving a carrot back.

476
00:36:18,869 --> 00:36:21,827
I just want to tell you I won't
need your flashlight anymore.

477
00:36:21,989 --> 00:36:24,059
Look here, Swivel Tongue.
If you come near me...

478
00:36:24,229 --> 00:36:26,584
- Quiet!
- You guys be quiet.

479
00:36:26,749 --> 00:36:30,025
It's him. He's making all the noise.
You'll wake everybody up.

480
00:36:30,189 --> 00:36:32,145
One, two, ten.

481
00:36:32,829 --> 00:36:37,425
- I'm a heel. That's what I am, a heel.
- Shut up, you heel!

482
00:37:27,029 --> 00:37:29,304
Ouch! Ouch!

483
00:37:29,589 --> 00:37:31,898
Ouch, ouch! Ouch!

484
00:37:32,109 --> 00:37:35,419
- Ouch! Ouch!
- What's going on here?

485
00:37:37,189 --> 00:37:39,942
- Come on. Get up. Wake up.
- Stop him.

486
00:37:40,109 --> 00:37:44,148
Get up. Wake up.
Come on, come out of it.

487
00:37:44,309 --> 00:37:46,903
So you'll hit me too, will you?

488
00:38:02,309 --> 00:38:05,460
Two days in the guardhouse.
If you ask me, you got off easy.

489
00:38:05,629 --> 00:38:08,780
- But I tell you, I wasn't drinking.
- You gave a good imitation of it.

490
00:38:08,949 --> 00:38:11,383
I was just having a bad dream.

491
00:38:19,149 --> 00:38:23,700
He kept jabbing at me with that
pitchfork. The last thing I remember...

492
00:38:28,269 --> 00:38:30,829
- There he is again!
- Hey you!

493
00:38:31,029 --> 00:38:33,224
Say. Wait a minute.

494
00:38:38,389 --> 00:38:41,108
- That's for the pitchfork.
- You'll get 10 years for this.

495
00:38:41,309 --> 00:38:45,860
I just wanted to tell you that I'm
really not Miss Winthrop's brother.

496
00:38:46,029 --> 00:38:49,021
- What happened in New York was a gag.
- That gun was no gag.

497
00:38:49,189 --> 00:38:52,181
- It wasn't loaded.
- I don't like your sense of humour.

498
00:38:52,349 --> 00:38:55,307
You better keep away because
every time I see you, I'll bop you.

499
00:38:55,509 --> 00:38:58,819
- Do you know who that man is?
- No, and what's more, I don't care.

500
00:38:58,989 --> 00:39:02,459
Okay, buddy, I'm gonna
let you find out all by yourself.

501
00:39:24,629 --> 00:39:27,223
- Mrs. Barton?
- Yes. I'm looking for my son.

502
00:39:27,389 --> 00:39:29,698
- I'll tell Captain Barton you're here.
- Thank you.

503
00:39:29,869 --> 00:39:31,302
Tom will be so glad to see you.

504
00:39:31,469 --> 00:39:35,018
I hope. He spent his leave convincing
us to come here instead of Florida.

505
00:39:35,189 --> 00:39:38,545
Don't let her fool you. She could
hardly wait to get out of New York.

506
00:39:42,629 --> 00:39:46,622
Captain Barton sends his regrets.
He'll be delayed a few minutes.

507
00:39:46,789 --> 00:39:49,542
- Where's the music coming from?
- From the guardhouse, ma'am.

508
00:39:49,709 --> 00:39:51,540
- Thank you.
- Yes, ma'am.

509
00:39:53,949 --> 00:39:56,099
Evening

510
00:39:56,269 --> 00:40:01,104
Creeping down the mountain

511
00:40:01,989 --> 00:40:05,538
Wak es up Mr. Firefly

512
00:40:05,709 --> 00:40:07,904
Firefly

513
00:40:09,709 --> 00:40:13,463
Bullfrog sitting there

514
00:40:13,629 --> 00:40:16,905
Starts a-croakin' but I don't care

515
00:40:17,069 --> 00:40:20,982
Since I kissed my baby goodbye

516
00:40:21,149 --> 00:40:23,947
Baby goodbye

517
00:40:25,069 --> 00:40:26,946
South wind

518
00:40:27,109 --> 00:40:31,739
Shak es the whole magnolia

519
00:40:32,509 --> 00:40:37,378
Moon Man lights the dingy sky

520
00:40:37,549 --> 00:40:40,063
The dingy sky

521
00:40:40,429 --> 00:40:45,423
Stars start sprinkling gold on the river

522
00:40:45,589 --> 00:40:47,545
But still I'm cold

523
00:40:47,709 --> 00:40:54,103
Since I kissed my baby goodbye

524
00:40:54,469 --> 00:40:59,020
Since my baby and me

525
00:40:59,189 --> 00:41:01,828
Parted company

526
00:41:01,989 --> 00:41:05,061
I can't see what's the diff

527
00:41:05,229 --> 00:41:08,904
If I live or I die

528
00:41:09,069 --> 00:41:12,505
Oh, Lord I've tak en

529
00:41:12,669 --> 00:41:17,982
Such a beating in the hood
Even cheating

530
00:41:18,149 --> 00:41:24,543
Since I kissed my baby goodbye

531
00:41:24,709 --> 00:41:28,827
Since my baby and me

532
00:41:28,989 --> 00:41:31,583
Parted company

533
00:41:31,749 --> 00:41:34,422
I can't see what's the diff

534
00:41:34,589 --> 00:41:38,218
If I live or I die

535
00:41:39,989 --> 00:41:41,980
Say, soldier. You're a beat off.

536
00:41:44,669 --> 00:41:48,787
- Sheila, what are you doing here?
- What are you doing there?

537
00:41:48,949 --> 00:41:50,382
I joined the Army.

538
00:41:50,549 --> 00:41:52,904
I see.
From penthouse to guardhouse.

539
00:41:53,069 --> 00:41:54,502
I got your letter and bracelet.

540
00:41:54,669 --> 00:41:57,229
- I can't tell you how badly...
- Do you like it down here?

541
00:41:57,389 --> 00:42:01,860
- The Army? It's wonderful.
- No. I mean the guardhouse.

542
00:42:02,029 --> 00:42:07,626
I'm not a prisoner. I'm inspecting the
place. It's part of a captain's duty.

543
00:42:07,789 --> 00:42:13,386
Captain Curtis. How democratic
of you to wear a private's uniform.

544
00:42:13,549 --> 00:42:18,782
This is temporary. My tent burned
and I had to order new uniforms.

545
00:42:19,229 --> 00:42:22,744
Someday, you're going to tell the
truth, and you'll feel like a new man.

546
00:42:22,909 --> 00:42:25,059
Sheila, how can I see you again?

547
00:42:26,349 --> 00:42:30,661
Keep sitting at that window, and one
of these days I might be passing by.

548
00:42:30,829 --> 00:42:33,024
- Where are you staying?
- Fallbrook Farm.

549
00:42:33,189 --> 00:42:34,542
May I call on you?

550
00:42:34,709 --> 00:42:39,783
Yes, indeed, captain. As soon as
your new uniforms get here.

551
00:42:39,949 --> 00:42:41,268
Sheila.

552
00:42:42,869 --> 00:42:45,702
But I tell you, borrowing
a captain's uniform isn't healthy.

553
00:42:45,869 --> 00:42:48,064
- What's health compared to romance?
- Yeah?

554
00:42:48,229 --> 00:42:52,427
What's romance to a court-martial?
Lmpersonating an officer is serious.

555
00:42:52,589 --> 00:42:56,138
It's worth the risk. If you'll shut up,
I'll figure how he can get a uniform.

556
00:42:56,309 --> 00:42:58,379
Even if he does, it won't fool anyone.

557
00:42:58,549 --> 00:43:01,302
- Curtis knows that.
- Do you think he ought to chance it?

558
00:43:01,509 --> 00:43:04,069
I know the girl ain't gonna
be fooled by a uniform.

559
00:43:04,229 --> 00:43:07,187
She will be impressed if Curtis
risks trying to show up in one.

560
00:43:07,589 --> 00:43:11,468
Now, all we gotta do is figure out
how he can get a uniform and...

561
00:43:12,429 --> 00:43:15,307
- Hey, Curtis.
- How in the world did you get that?

562
00:43:15,469 --> 00:43:18,381
I've got a pull around here.
Besides, nobody was looking.

563
00:43:18,549 --> 00:43:22,019
- Boy, am I worried.
- Wish me luck, boys. I'm on my way.

564
00:43:22,829 --> 00:43:28,586
Just like Don Juan.
Boy, ain't romance beautiful?

565
00:43:58,029 --> 00:44:00,099
- How do you do?
- How do you do?

566
00:44:00,269 --> 00:44:03,944
- I came to see Miss Winthrop.
- I expect her back any moment.

567
00:44:04,109 --> 00:44:06,339
Won't you come in, Captain...?

568
00:44:07,429 --> 00:44:10,501
- Curtis.
- Come in, Captain Curtis.

569
00:44:15,229 --> 00:44:19,268
I was just about to have some tea.
Won't you join me?

570
00:44:19,429 --> 00:44:23,388
- Thank you.
- I'm sure Sheila won't be long.

571
00:44:24,669 --> 00:44:26,944
- Won't you sit down?
- Thank you.

572
00:44:27,109 --> 00:44:31,102
- Was she expecting you?
- Well, yes.

573
00:44:31,749 --> 00:44:34,741
I don't think I've met you before,
Captain Curtis.

574
00:44:34,909 --> 00:44:36,820
I just got here.

575
00:44:37,749 --> 00:44:41,344
I was sent from Washington to make
a general survey of Army camps.

576
00:44:41,549 --> 00:44:47,146
How interesting! Sit and tell me about it.
You were sent from Washington.

577
00:44:47,309 --> 00:44:52,588
I'm to recommend how to improve
living conditions for new selectees.

578
00:44:52,789 --> 00:44:56,338
- Indeed. Sugar?
- Thank you.

579
00:44:56,509 --> 00:44:59,626
You see, the enlisted man
is the backbone of the Army.

580
00:44:59,789 --> 00:45:04,340
And sometimes officers are not as
considerate as I think they should be.

581
00:45:09,149 --> 00:45:10,423
Robert, what in the world...?

582
00:45:10,589 --> 00:45:12,944
You said call when I got
my new uniform. Like it?

583
00:45:13,109 --> 00:45:18,137
- Well, Mother.
- This is my son, Captain Barton.

584
00:45:18,949 --> 00:45:23,579
- Did you say "Captain Barton"?
- Yes. How are you, Captain Curtis?

585
00:45:24,789 --> 00:45:26,108
Not very well.

586
00:45:26,429 --> 00:45:28,704
Captain Curtis was sent
from Washington, dear.

587
00:45:28,869 --> 00:45:32,748
He's reporting on the relationship
between enlisted men and officers.

588
00:45:32,909 --> 00:45:34,501
Is that so?

589
00:45:34,829 --> 00:45:37,741
That must be the others.
Will you let them in, Tom?

590
00:45:37,949 --> 00:45:42,340
I invited some of his friends for tea.
Will you excuse me?

591
00:45:43,229 --> 00:45:45,618
- This isn't another gag, is it?
- I'm afraid it isn't.

592
00:45:45,789 --> 00:45:47,108
Why didn't you warn me?

593
00:45:47,269 --> 00:45:50,261
How did I know you'd be silly
enough to try a thing like this?

594
00:45:50,429 --> 00:45:52,340
Where's the back door?

595
00:45:54,829 --> 00:45:56,308
Captain Curtis.

596
00:45:58,069 --> 00:46:02,142
I want you to meet my friends,
Captain Nolan and Captain Williams.

597
00:46:02,309 --> 00:46:04,106
- How do you do?
- You know Miss Winthrop.

598
00:46:04,269 --> 00:46:05,622
- Yes.
- How do you do?

599
00:46:05,789 --> 00:46:10,226
I'm so sorry we're late, Mrs. Barton,
but somebody stole my coat.

600
00:46:11,229 --> 00:46:15,984
Dreadful. I hope this doesn't give you
the wrong impression of our camp.

601
00:46:16,189 --> 00:46:22,298
No, not at all. I'm sure the man who
took it is already suffering for it.

602
00:46:22,509 --> 00:46:26,422
Captain Curtis has been sent from
Washington. To investigate us.

603
00:46:26,589 --> 00:46:30,662
Is that so? Tell us, captain,
how do you find conditions here?

604
00:46:31,869 --> 00:46:36,340
Splendid, splendid.
The officers are all fine men.

605
00:46:36,509 --> 00:46:39,945
And very lenient with the selectees,
I hope.

606
00:46:40,149 --> 00:46:43,505
Have you investigated
our guardhouses, captain?

607
00:46:43,949 --> 00:46:48,147
Not completely. I expect
to spend much more time there.

608
00:46:48,309 --> 00:46:51,745
Tell me. What action would
you recommend in the case...

609
00:46:51,909 --> 00:46:55,060
...of a private stealing
a captain's coat?

610
00:46:56,109 --> 00:47:01,627
- Well, I wouldn't have him shot.
- You wouldn't?

611
00:47:01,789 --> 00:47:06,101
No, that's much too drastic. Besides,
it would spoil him for active duty.

612
00:47:06,309 --> 00:47:08,027
What would you recommend?

613
00:47:08,189 --> 00:47:11,784
I'd throw him in the guardhouse until
he learned. Which wouldn't take long.

614
00:47:11,949 --> 00:47:14,668
- Yes. A perfect recommendation.
- Thank you.

615
00:47:14,829 --> 00:47:17,741
If you gentlemen will excuse me,
I have an important engagement.

616
00:47:17,909 --> 00:47:23,222
- Goodbye, Mrs. Barton. Thank you.
- I'll take you to the door.

617
00:47:27,909 --> 00:47:31,345
- Do you realize the trouble you're in?
- Who is this Captain Barton?

618
00:47:31,509 --> 00:47:33,898
A friend. Aunt Louise and I
are visiting his mother.

619
00:47:34,069 --> 00:47:36,185
- How good a friend?
- A very good friend.

620
00:47:36,349 --> 00:47:39,261
But this is no time to discuss that.
You're in a bad situation.

621
00:47:39,429 --> 00:47:42,819
I certainly am. While I'm in the
guardhouse, he'll see you every day.

622
00:47:43,029 --> 00:47:48,342
He's a nice young man. I hope
he gives our camp a good report.

623
00:47:50,149 --> 00:47:55,826
It won't be so bad, if you arrange
to pass my window every day.

624
00:47:56,069 --> 00:47:59,857
You're saying nice things again.
What's Mr. Cortland up to now?

625
00:48:00,029 --> 00:48:03,339
Cortland hasn't anything to do
with it. This time, I mean everything.

626
00:48:03,509 --> 00:48:05,943
And this time,
I still don't believe a word of it.

627
00:48:06,109 --> 00:48:07,861
I don't blame you.

628
00:48:08,469 --> 00:48:13,020
Sheila, I'm sorry for everything
that happened in New York.

629
00:48:13,189 --> 00:48:15,623
How about starting over again
from there?

630
00:48:16,349 --> 00:48:18,021
Would you do that?

631
00:48:19,109 --> 00:48:23,387
Well, yes. We could try
if you're sure you'd like to.

632
00:48:23,589 --> 00:48:27,025
I was never so sure of anything
in my life. Goodbye.

633
00:48:27,229 --> 00:48:28,548
Bye.

634
00:48:29,589 --> 00:48:31,819
Where does the captain wish to go?

635
00:48:32,029 --> 00:48:35,658
To the guardhouse.
And don't call me captain.

636
00:48:40,309 --> 00:48:42,698
- Welcome home, Curtis.
- We were expecting you.

637
00:48:42,869 --> 00:48:44,188
Hi, fellas.

638
00:48:44,349 --> 00:48:47,819
Here, my good man. Take this back to
the officers' quarters, and let me in.

639
00:48:47,989 --> 00:48:50,901
- You haven't done anything.
- That's what you think.

640
00:48:53,389 --> 00:48:54,583
What are you in for?

641
00:48:54,749 --> 00:48:57,138
We fought a rear guard battle for you
and got five days.

642
00:48:57,269 --> 00:48:59,419
- Oh, that's a shame.
- How long are you in for?

643
00:48:59,589 --> 00:49:02,945
Brother, I don't know, and I don't care.
I'm a man that's in love.

644
00:49:03,109 --> 00:49:04,747
Yes, sir.

645
00:51:32,749 --> 00:51:36,708
Hey, Curtis. There they are again. Same
time every day for the last two weeks.

646
00:51:38,309 --> 00:51:40,459
They're 10 minutes late today,
by my watch.

647
00:51:40,629 --> 00:51:44,065
Cheer up, Curtis. I'm getting out
in a few months. I'll give her your love.

648
00:51:44,229 --> 00:51:45,318
I wish you'd shut up.

649
00:51:45,389 --> 00:51:49,098
Why don't you wish
for a pardon and a horse?

650
00:51:50,149 --> 00:51:52,026
All right, Curtis. Come on.

651
00:51:52,309 --> 00:51:54,425
- What's up?
- Colonel Shiller wants to see you.

652
00:51:54,589 --> 00:51:56,386
- About what?
- We forgot to ask him.

653
00:51:56,549 --> 00:51:58,824
Ain't that awful? Come on.

654
00:51:59,149 --> 00:52:02,698
Although we've received cooperation
from men in your profession...

655
00:52:02,869 --> 00:52:05,747
...this is quite the most generous
offer we've had.

656
00:52:05,909 --> 00:52:07,342
It's purely selfish, sir.

657
00:52:07,509 --> 00:52:11,866
I just wanted to feel that I am having a
part in this great work that you are doing.

658
00:52:12,029 --> 00:52:14,623
Bringing your show down here
certainly proves that.

659
00:52:14,789 --> 00:52:19,021
Our obligation to the boys includes
more than just teaching them to march.

660
00:52:19,669 --> 00:52:22,103
Pvt. Curtis reporting to the
colonel from the guardhouse.

661
00:52:22,269 --> 00:52:24,499
- Bring him in.
- Yes, sir. Come in.

662
00:52:28,069 --> 00:52:29,946
At ease, Pvt. Curtis.

663
00:52:30,109 --> 00:52:32,577
- I think you know Mr. Cortland.
- Yes.

664
00:52:32,749 --> 00:52:33,943
- Hello, Martin.
- Robert.

665
00:52:34,109 --> 00:52:37,579
Mr. Cortland will bring his entire company
from New York to put on a show.

666
00:52:37,749 --> 00:52:40,263
- That's very generous of him, sir.
- Oh, not at all.

667
00:52:40,429 --> 00:52:44,581
Do you think you could forego being
a pioneer resident of the guardhouse...

668
00:52:44,749 --> 00:52:48,503
...long enough to assist him?
- Oh, I'm sure of it, sir.

669
00:52:48,669 --> 00:52:51,786
So the shock of being away
from the guardhouse won't be too great...

670
00:52:51,949 --> 00:52:54,338
...you will continue to spend
your nights there.

671
00:52:54,509 --> 00:52:56,898
- Yes, sir.
- Well, thanks again, Mr. Cortland.

672
00:52:57,069 --> 00:52:58,582
Thank you, Colonel Shiller.

673
00:52:58,749 --> 00:53:00,228
Have you arranged your quarters?

674
00:53:00,389 --> 00:53:02,505
No, I haven't,
but I'm gonna look around today.

675
00:53:02,669 --> 00:53:04,580
I have an apartment in town
you can use.

676
00:53:04,749 --> 00:53:06,421
Robert, that's very nice. Thank you.

677
00:53:06,589 --> 00:53:09,786
Inasmuch as Pvt. Curtis won't be using it.

678
00:53:09,949 --> 00:53:11,382
Good day, colonel.

679
00:53:11,549 --> 00:53:13,346
That'll be all, Curtis.

680
00:53:21,389 --> 00:53:24,426
Now, what's your real idea
in doing this show in camp?

681
00:53:24,589 --> 00:53:25,942
Why, I'm surprised at you.

682
00:53:26,109 --> 00:53:28,987
You know I've always wanted
to do something for the government.

683
00:53:29,149 --> 00:53:31,344
You'd think I was getting
something out of this.

684
00:53:31,509 --> 00:53:34,387
- Only my services for nothing.
- What do you mean, for nothing?

685
00:53:34,549 --> 00:53:36,460
The government pays you $21 a month.

686
00:53:36,629 --> 00:53:40,144
Where does that money come from?
The taxpayers. I'm a taxpayer.

687
00:53:40,309 --> 00:53:42,539
- Let me thank you, Martin.
- Don't mention it.

688
00:53:42,709 --> 00:53:46,304
If I didn't hate that guardhouse so much,
I wouldn't even be talking to you.

689
00:53:49,389 --> 00:53:51,778
What are they for,
to keep you from swiping medals?

690
00:53:51,949 --> 00:53:53,587
Part of my deal with the government.

691
00:53:53,709 --> 00:53:55,620
They wouldn't let you out
except under guard.

692
00:53:55,749 --> 00:53:58,388
Every time you get an idea,
something happens to me.

693
00:53:58,549 --> 00:54:00,619
All right. I'm your man.
The show is on.

694
00:54:00,789 --> 00:54:04,498
I'll tell you why. Next door lives a little
lady who's going to dance with me.

695
00:54:04,669 --> 00:54:06,785
- Little lady? Who?
- Miss Sheila Winthrop.

696
00:54:06,949 --> 00:54:09,907
Sheila Winthrop? Up here?
Robert, you don't want her.

697
00:54:10,069 --> 00:54:14,108
Why, she's a dangerous character.
She almost broke me up with my wife.

698
00:54:14,269 --> 00:54:17,705
Besides, I promised the part
to somebody else.

699
00:54:17,869 --> 00:54:19,188
Now it comes out.

700
00:54:19,349 --> 00:54:22,227
I thought I recognized that look
in your eye. Who is it now?

701
00:54:22,389 --> 00:54:26,382
Well, she's a very nice little item
named Sonya. A gorgeous creature.

702
00:54:26,549 --> 00:54:27,982
I've given her my word...

703
00:54:28,149 --> 00:54:31,505
Give her a bracelet instead,
because Sonya isn't dancing in this show.

704
00:54:31,669 --> 00:54:32,758
Robert, my pal...

705
00:54:32,829 --> 00:54:35,389
You promised there'd be
no more galloping over rooftops.

706
00:54:35,549 --> 00:54:37,221
This is different.
She's a foreigner.

707
00:54:37,389 --> 00:54:40,825
What's different?
A gallop is a gallop in any language.

708
00:54:41,629 --> 00:54:44,097
Hey! This way.

709
00:54:51,869 --> 00:54:55,828
Hey, sergeant, bring me in a house,
will you? Right here. Put it here.

710
00:54:55,989 --> 00:54:59,299
And I want a tree right here.

711
00:54:59,469 --> 00:55:00,504
That's right.

712
00:55:00,669 --> 00:55:02,227
Let me see, now...

713
00:55:02,469 --> 00:55:05,108
Hey, boys! Bring in the ocean, will you?

714
00:55:05,509 --> 00:55:07,784
That's right. Come on!

715
00:55:08,189 --> 00:55:12,705
- Okay. Sergeant, is Miss Winthrop ready?
- Yes, she's ready.

716
00:55:13,909 --> 00:55:19,541
That Miss Winthrop, she is so beautiful,
and I hate her so much!

717
00:55:19,709 --> 00:55:21,586
When will Mr. Curtis put me in her place?

718
00:55:21,749 --> 00:55:24,627
Any day, Sonya.
I'm working on a new angle.

719
00:55:24,789 --> 00:55:27,622
A new angle, old angle,
this angle, that angle.

720
00:55:27,789 --> 00:55:30,462
I want to dance,
and all you do is "angle" me.

721
00:55:30,629 --> 00:55:33,143
- Now, listen, you trust me, don't you?
- No.

722
00:55:33,309 --> 00:55:36,107
Well, that's ridiculous.
Everybody trusts me.

723
00:55:37,709 --> 00:55:43,261
My dear, I've a feeling you are

724
00:55:43,389 --> 00:55:48,702
So near and yet so far

725
00:55:48,829 --> 00:55:54,825
You appear lik e a radiant star

726
00:55:54,949 --> 00:56:00,546
First so near
Then again so far

727
00:56:00,669 --> 00:56:05,789
I just start getting you k een on
Clinches galore with me

728
00:56:06,669 --> 00:56:12,380
When fate steps in on the scene
And mops up the floor with me

729
00:56:12,509 --> 00:56:17,822
No wonder I'm a bit under par

730
00:56:17,949 --> 00:56:23,626
For you're so near
And yet so far

731
00:56:23,749 --> 00:56:29,858
My condition is only so-so
'Cause whenever I feel you're close, oh

732
00:56:29,989 --> 00:56:32,867
You turn out to be

733
00:56:32,989 --> 00:56:36,504
Oh, so far

734
00:59:26,469 --> 00:59:29,666
- Sheila, you're wonderful.
- That's because you're a good teacher.

735
00:59:29,829 --> 00:59:32,901
What's wonderful about you
isn't anything I taught you.

736
00:59:33,069 --> 00:59:35,424
What's wonderful about you is you.

737
00:59:35,589 --> 00:59:36,817
That's bracelet talk.

738
00:59:36,989 --> 00:59:39,219
Sure it is, but not the way
you think it is.

739
00:59:39,389 --> 00:59:43,428
That bracelet happens to mean
an awful lot to me. It brought us together.

740
00:59:43,589 --> 00:59:46,228
Well, that's one way of looking at it.

741
00:59:46,389 --> 00:59:48,778
That's the way I look at it.
I bought it from Martin.

742
00:59:50,349 --> 00:59:51,782
You did?

743
00:59:55,509 --> 00:59:58,899
Robert, you're one of the most
charming men I've ever known.

744
00:59:59,069 --> 01:00:01,663
And the most unconvincing.

745
01:00:04,549 --> 01:00:08,588
Oh, Captain Curtis,
are we too late to see the rehearsals?

746
01:00:08,749 --> 01:00:10,819
No, we're starting again
in a few moments.

747
01:00:10,989 --> 01:00:13,867
I'd like to speak to Sheila
if you can spare her.

748
01:00:14,029 --> 01:00:16,099
Yes, sir. Of course.
For a few minutes.

749
01:00:16,269 --> 01:00:20,342
- I have something to tell her.
- Tom is being transferred to Panama.

750
01:00:21,149 --> 01:00:23,424
Come on, Sheila.
I'll tell you all about it.

751
01:00:23,589 --> 01:00:29,221
Isn't it wonderful? After all these years,
they're going to be married.

752
01:00:29,389 --> 01:00:30,742
What?

753
01:00:30,909 --> 01:00:33,787
- I didn't know a thing about it.
- He's going to ask her now.

754
01:00:33,949 --> 01:00:36,258
- Do you think she might say yes?
- Of course.

755
01:00:36,429 --> 01:00:41,264
Our family's been planning it for years.
Don't look so upset, Capt. Curtis.

756
01:00:41,429 --> 01:00:44,739
They won't be leaving for Panama
until after your show is over.

757
01:00:44,909 --> 01:00:47,343
Pardon me, please.
I have to change my clothes.

758
01:00:47,509 --> 01:00:49,340
Oh, Robert?
Wait a minute, please.

759
01:00:49,509 --> 01:00:53,024
One more chance to save my wife
from a terrible fate. Sonya's threatening...

760
01:00:53,189 --> 01:00:55,578
You're wasting your breath.
Where's that bracelet?

761
01:00:55,749 --> 01:00:59,901
It's in your apartment, in my suitcase.
Sonya is... Where are you going?

762
01:01:00,069 --> 01:01:04,187
To my apartment. Say one more word,
and I'll throw those bloodhounds at you.

763
01:01:10,909 --> 01:01:13,548
To the apartment.
After all I've done for him.

764
01:01:13,709 --> 01:01:15,062
After all these...

765
01:01:15,269 --> 01:01:17,942
Hey, I changed the name
on the bracelet!

766
01:01:20,869 --> 01:01:24,418
Say, that's fine. I'm a genius!

767
01:01:25,029 --> 01:01:28,066
I'll bring them together again,
and your conscience will be clear.

768
01:01:28,229 --> 01:01:31,665
But I don't worry about my conscience.
I only worry about my career.

769
01:01:31,829 --> 01:01:33,899
You let me do the worrying, huh?

770
01:01:34,069 --> 01:01:38,347
All right. I let you do the worrying,
but if your plan doesn't work...

771
01:01:38,509 --> 01:01:41,899
Oh, it will work, believe me.
I wouldn't be mixed up in a thing like this.

772
01:01:42,069 --> 01:01:46,426
It's pretty low, you know.
But it's a national emergency, my dear.

773
01:01:48,069 --> 01:01:49,263
Well, Sheila?

774
01:01:49,429 --> 01:01:52,865
- Aunt Louise, Tom proposed to me.
- Yes.

775
01:01:53,389 --> 01:01:58,224
And out of the clear sky,
I realized I was in love with Robert.

776
01:01:58,389 --> 01:01:59,424
Did you tell Tom?

777
01:01:59,709 --> 01:02:02,906
Not yet. Tom asked me not to give him
my answer until tonight.

778
01:02:03,069 --> 01:02:06,857
What an eventful day this is.
When did Robert ask you to marry him?

779
01:02:07,029 --> 01:02:09,020
He hasn't yet...

780
01:02:09,229 --> 01:02:10,582
...but I think he will.

781
01:02:10,749 --> 01:02:13,946
I suspected something like that.
I've been married three times.

782
01:02:14,109 --> 01:02:15,383
- Four.
- That's right.

783
01:02:15,549 --> 01:02:17,460
I keep forgetting poor Mr. Trapscott.

784
01:02:18,789 --> 01:02:19,878
How do you do?

785
01:02:19,949 --> 01:02:21,826
You seem familiar with Army regulations.

786
01:02:21,989 --> 01:02:24,059
What happens to a private
who goes AWOL?

787
01:02:24,229 --> 01:02:27,665
- Well, it depends. Why?
- I'm afraid Robert's in quite a jam.

788
01:02:27,829 --> 01:02:31,219
He's in his apartment in town,
and Col. Shiller is due in half an hour.

789
01:02:31,389 --> 01:02:33,619
- Why don't you phone?
- I have. He doesn't answer.

790
01:02:33,789 --> 01:02:36,986
If anything happens to that boy,
I'll never forgive myself.

791
01:02:38,869 --> 01:02:40,780
I'll go get him. My car's right outside.

792
01:02:40,949 --> 01:02:43,065
- It won't be too much trouble?
- Not at all.

793
01:02:43,229 --> 01:02:45,220
There's something
I want to talk over with him.

794
01:02:45,389 --> 01:02:47,459
You've taken the load off my mind.

795
01:02:47,669 --> 01:02:49,068
- See you later.
- Bye, dear.

796
01:02:49,229 --> 01:02:51,424
- Will you pardon me, please?
- All right.

797
01:02:53,629 --> 01:02:54,964
Martin, aren't you ashamed?

798
01:02:54,999 --> 01:02:56,300
Martin, aren't you ashamed?

799
01:02:57,109 --> 01:03:00,260
Can you forget those gophers
long enough to do me a favour?

800
01:03:00,429 --> 01:03:01,464
Sure. What's up?

801
01:03:01,629 --> 01:03:05,065
Listen, I've got to go AWOL long enough
to get a wedding license.

802
01:03:05,229 --> 01:03:07,823
I've got to convince her I'm on the level
when I propose.

803
01:03:07,989 --> 01:03:09,388
- Miss Winthrop?
- Yeah.

804
01:03:09,549 --> 01:03:13,258
I want you to keep those guards so busy
they won't miss me for an hour or so.

805
01:03:13,429 --> 01:03:16,819
By the time you change your clothes,
we'll have everything under control.

806
01:03:16,989 --> 01:03:19,105
Okay, fellas. So long, fellas.

807
01:03:39,149 --> 01:03:40,867
Hi, soldier.

808
01:04:04,869 --> 01:04:07,337
Hey, fellas, did a hat go by here?

809
01:04:07,509 --> 01:04:09,465
Hey, Kewpie! Kewpie!

810
01:04:09,629 --> 01:04:13,065
Where are you? Kewpie!
I got him.

811
01:04:13,389 --> 01:04:15,220
Kewpie! Here it is.

812
01:04:15,389 --> 01:04:18,301
Boy, are we lucky! If he'd got away,
goodbye, Camp Weston.

813
01:04:18,469 --> 01:04:20,460
- What's going on?
- We got a spy under there.

814
01:04:20,629 --> 01:04:23,746
- A what?
- It's a foreign pigeon from Europe.

815
01:04:23,909 --> 01:04:25,740
- What'll you do?
- We gotta get the major.

816
01:04:25,909 --> 01:04:27,786
Keep your eyes on it.
Don't let it get away!

817
01:04:27,949 --> 01:04:29,905
Wait a minute.
How can a pigeon be a spy?

818
01:04:30,069 --> 01:04:32,708
They train them.
They import a trainer from the Army.

819
01:04:32,869 --> 01:04:36,748
It's got a camera tied to its leg.
We caught it taking pictures of the camp.

820
01:04:36,909 --> 01:04:40,822
- Well, I'm a son of a gun.
- Hey! Don't do that.

821
01:04:40,989 --> 01:04:43,457
If that bird ever... You'd both be shot.

822
01:04:43,629 --> 01:04:46,939
Don't let that pigeon get away from you,
soldier. Come on, Swivel.

823
01:04:55,749 --> 01:04:58,547
- What's going on here?
- Something's under the hat.

824
01:04:58,709 --> 01:05:00,347
- What is it, boys?
- It's a spy.

825
01:05:00,509 --> 01:05:02,864
- In the hat.
- In whose hat? Are you crazy?

826
01:05:03,029 --> 01:05:04,940
It's a pigeon spy. European.

827
01:05:05,109 --> 01:05:08,658
It's a spy, all right.
He's got a camera strapped to his leg.

828
01:05:08,829 --> 01:05:12,299
Whoever heard of a pigeon
that could operate a camera?

829
01:05:12,749 --> 01:05:14,979
The son of a gun bit me!

830
01:05:30,469 --> 01:05:32,778
Oh, Mr. Curtis. You frightened me!

831
01:05:32,949 --> 01:05:34,587
What do you think you did to me?

832
01:05:34,749 --> 01:05:36,262
What are you doing here?

833
01:05:36,429 --> 01:05:38,579
This happens to be my apartment.

834
01:05:39,029 --> 01:05:43,341
I'm sorry. I didn't know.
Mr. Cortland told me I could use it.

835
01:05:43,509 --> 01:05:46,421
Well, now, that's mighty chummy
all around, isn't it?

836
01:05:47,509 --> 01:05:50,706
My, this is terrible!
What would people think?

837
01:05:50,869 --> 01:05:54,305
Take it easy, my innocent little friend.
I'll be out of here in one minute.

838
01:05:54,469 --> 01:05:58,462
Tell Mr. Cortland the next time he passes
out apartments that don't belong to him...

839
01:06:00,029 --> 01:06:01,587
The bloodhounds.

840
01:06:11,229 --> 01:06:13,345
Robert, are you there?

841
01:06:15,509 --> 01:06:18,581
Why, Sheila!
Lmagine you standing there.

842
01:06:21,069 --> 01:06:22,821
Why, yes, it's Sheila.

843
01:06:22,989 --> 01:06:25,787
You might let me in.
I'm not selling anything.

844
01:06:27,709 --> 01:06:30,177
Sure, sure. Come in.

845
01:06:30,349 --> 01:06:34,706
- Well, Sheila, how are you?
- I'm fine, but you're in trouble.

846
01:06:34,869 --> 01:06:38,225
- What trouble did you hear about?
- You're AWOL. They're looking for you.

847
01:06:38,389 --> 01:06:40,425
As trouble goes, that's nothing.

848
01:06:40,589 --> 01:06:43,581
If you go back to the guardhouse,
that's a lot of trouble to me.

849
01:06:43,749 --> 01:06:45,467
Sheila, that's sweet.

850
01:06:45,629 --> 01:06:47,859
Come on, I'll drive you back in my car.

851
01:06:49,749 --> 01:06:51,660
That must be the boys.

852
01:06:51,949 --> 01:06:53,985
Better let me handle this.

853
01:06:56,509 --> 01:06:59,307
Hello, Miss Winthrop.
Is Pvt. Curtis in there?

854
01:06:59,469 --> 01:07:01,346
I thought he was in the Army.

855
01:07:01,509 --> 01:07:04,103
He'll be in the Army plenty
when we nab him.

856
01:07:04,269 --> 01:07:07,625
Well, there's no hurry.
We'll wait around a while.

857
01:07:10,469 --> 01:07:12,585
- Is there a back way out?
- Back way?

858
01:07:12,749 --> 01:07:14,819
This is a second floor apartment.
Oh, wait!

859
01:07:14,989 --> 01:07:17,583
There's a fire escape
outside the bedroom window.

860
01:07:18,109 --> 01:07:21,465
- Hold it! We can't go in there.
- Why not?

861
01:07:21,629 --> 01:07:23,824
Well, you see, that's my bedroom.

862
01:07:23,989 --> 01:07:25,502
Don't be coy.

863
01:07:25,669 --> 01:07:27,739
Well, I mean, there's work
going on in there.

864
01:07:27,909 --> 01:07:30,059
There's a plumber.

865
01:07:30,229 --> 01:07:33,585
- What difference does that make?
- What difference?

866
01:07:35,069 --> 01:07:38,982
- There you are.
- He's just fixing the shower. Come on.

867
01:07:49,469 --> 01:07:51,027
Charming, wasn't it?

868
01:07:52,749 --> 01:07:56,105
- You mean, that little...
- That dainty little garment. Yes.

869
01:07:56,269 --> 01:07:59,147
What the well-dressed plumber
is wearing, I guess.

870
01:07:59,309 --> 01:08:02,585
It takes all kinds of plumbers
to make a world.

871
01:08:02,749 --> 01:08:06,185
It was simply adorable.
I'd love to know where he bought it.

872
01:08:06,349 --> 01:08:10,183
No, I wouldn't do that. You don't know
how some people feel about those things.

873
01:08:10,349 --> 01:08:12,260
Plumber?

874
01:08:12,909 --> 01:08:14,900
His voice is changing.

875
01:08:15,069 --> 01:08:16,900
Sonya, come out of there.

876
01:08:20,789 --> 01:08:23,587
Tell Miss Winthrop
exactly what happened.

877
01:08:23,749 --> 01:08:27,947
- Shall I tell her everything?
- Yes. What do you mean, everything?

878
01:08:28,109 --> 01:08:30,703
- Don't you believe it, Sheila.
- I don't.

879
01:08:30,869 --> 01:08:33,144
Sonya is trying too hard.

880
01:08:33,309 --> 01:08:36,142
- Sheila, you're wonderful.
- I'm surprised, Sonya.

881
01:08:36,309 --> 01:08:39,506
- This is the oldest game in the world.
- You think so?

882
01:08:39,669 --> 01:08:42,706
If I were you,
I'd stick to plumbing exclusively.

883
01:08:44,709 --> 01:08:47,621
A plumber? Aren't you silly?
Why didn't you tell me the truth?

884
01:08:47,789 --> 01:08:50,098
How did I know you were
one girl in 50 million?

885
01:08:50,269 --> 01:08:53,261
Let this be a lesson to you.
Let's get down this fire escape.

886
01:08:53,909 --> 01:08:56,787
By the way, what did you come
to your apartment for?

887
01:08:58,469 --> 01:09:00,744
- It was a surprise, Sheila.
- For whom?

888
01:09:00,909 --> 01:09:03,218
- You.
- Tell me.

889
01:09:03,389 --> 01:09:06,267
- No, I'd rather wait until after the show.
- Now that I know...

890
01:09:06,429 --> 01:09:08,784
No. I'll tell you later.
Come on. Let's go.

891
01:09:08,949 --> 01:09:10,667
That's it, isn't it?

892
01:09:11,709 --> 01:09:15,941
I'm gonna feel awful about this.
You shouldn't have done that.

893
01:09:16,109 --> 01:09:17,144
No.

894
01:09:17,309 --> 01:09:20,460
Especially since
it's for "dear, sweet Sonya."

895
01:09:20,669 --> 01:09:22,261
What is?

896
01:09:22,549 --> 01:09:25,507
I can see why you wanted
to save the surprise.

897
01:09:26,069 --> 01:09:29,300
- Holy smoke! Something's happened here.
- So it seems.

898
01:09:29,469 --> 01:09:32,347
- But I bought this bracelet from Martin...
- Certainly.

899
01:09:32,509 --> 01:09:35,899
And after he sold it, he went
to all that trouble, just for the fun of it.

900
01:09:36,069 --> 01:09:37,866
You know Martin's apt to do anything.

901
01:09:38,029 --> 01:09:41,863
"One woman in 50 million" can
certainly be simple-minded at times.

902
01:09:42,989 --> 01:09:45,025
There's a perfect explanation.

903
01:09:45,189 --> 01:09:48,420
Write it to me. A letter will reach me
in Panama in about a week.

904
01:09:48,589 --> 01:09:50,898
What's Panama got to do with this?

905
01:09:51,069 --> 01:09:53,344
I'll be there with Capt. Barton.

906
01:09:53,509 --> 01:09:56,262
We're leaving in a few days,
right after the marriage.

907
01:09:56,429 --> 01:09:59,307
- You've got this all wrong.
- The guards.

908
01:10:33,509 --> 01:10:38,981
Would you please get me
Mrs. Martin Cortland, Adirondack 5636.

909
01:10:39,149 --> 01:10:40,423
Thank you. I'll hold on.

910
01:10:43,029 --> 01:10:46,339
- See you at rehearsal.
- Sure thing, baby. You said it.

911
01:10:46,509 --> 01:10:49,182
Now, that's sensible.
Martin will be very happy.

912
01:10:49,349 --> 01:10:52,944
Oh, he'll be tickled pink.
Everybody will be happy.

913
01:10:53,109 --> 01:10:54,906
- Goodbye.
- Goodbye.

914
01:11:00,109 --> 01:11:03,579
Hello? Hello? Julia?

915
01:11:03,829 --> 01:11:05,308
This is Robert.

916
01:11:05,669 --> 01:11:09,867
Yeah. Julia, Martin and I
are putting on a show at camp.

917
01:11:11,349 --> 01:11:14,182
Well, hello, boys.
I've been looking for you. Sit down.

918
01:11:14,349 --> 01:11:20,060
Julia, what I called to say is,
it looks like very stormy weather up here.

919
01:11:20,229 --> 01:11:21,821
Do tell.

920
01:11:23,309 --> 01:11:26,142
It's a tornado, honey. A hurricane.

921
01:11:26,309 --> 01:11:29,267
In fact, the blow is so hard,
it lifts you right off your feet.

922
01:11:29,429 --> 01:11:31,465
Goodbye. I have to go now.

923
01:11:31,629 --> 01:11:33,540
To the guardhouse, boys.

924
01:11:40,109 --> 01:11:42,179
Sonya's gonna be very good
in this show.

925
01:11:42,349 --> 01:11:45,147
- I don't think we'll miss Sheila at all.
- I don't think so.

926
01:11:45,309 --> 01:11:47,982
Is she really going off to Panama
with that Barton fella?

927
01:11:48,149 --> 01:11:49,707
So I've heard.

928
01:11:49,869 --> 01:11:53,100
Too bad. It's your own fault.
You will play around.

929
01:11:53,269 --> 01:11:55,100
I'm just a dirty dog.

930
01:11:55,269 --> 01:11:57,339
Live and learn, I always say.

931
01:11:58,829 --> 01:12:00,547
Live and learn.

932
01:12:01,629 --> 01:12:06,305
Robert, do me a favour, will you?
Look back and tell me, is that Julia?

933
01:12:06,469 --> 01:12:08,699
I wouldn't be surprised.

934
01:12:08,869 --> 01:12:12,225
Did you have anything to do with this,
you despicable, sordid...?

935
01:12:12,789 --> 01:12:16,782
- Julia, why, this is a delightful surprise!
- Hello, Martin dear.

936
01:12:16,949 --> 01:12:18,462
- Hello, Robert.
- Hello, Julia.

937
01:12:18,629 --> 01:12:20,585
You'd think you'd telegraph
and warn a person.

938
01:12:20,749 --> 01:12:22,819
Not that I'm not tickled to death
to see you.

939
01:12:22,989 --> 01:12:25,742
- You look delirious.
- He's missed you terribly, Julia.

940
01:12:25,909 --> 01:12:29,185
He's been pining his heart away. He
rushed into town to buy you something.

941
01:12:29,349 --> 01:12:32,182
A lovely little trinket,
right there in his pocket.

942
01:12:33,109 --> 01:12:36,021
Something to scratch with, no doubt.

943
01:12:36,389 --> 01:12:37,981
Well...

944
01:12:40,469 --> 01:12:43,267
"For my dear, sweet Sonya."

945
01:12:43,429 --> 01:12:45,784
Listen, Julia,
there's been a hideous mistake.

946
01:12:45,949 --> 01:12:48,179
Oh, Sonya, would you
come here a moment, please?

947
01:12:48,349 --> 01:12:51,466
- I can explain everything.
- Better make it a good one.

948
01:12:51,629 --> 01:12:54,302
It's Robert. I'm using his apartment
and last night, he said:

949
01:12:54,469 --> 01:12:57,905
"Martin, bring me the bracelet
I bought for Sonya."

950
01:12:58,069 --> 01:13:00,503
Look at it. It's the same one
he bought for Sheila.

951
01:13:00,669 --> 01:13:03,979
He broke Sheila's heart playing around
with Sonya, and she gave it back.

952
01:13:04,149 --> 01:13:08,427
And then the cad had the name changed
on the very same bracelet.

953
01:13:08,589 --> 01:13:09,817
Boy, that was a pip.

954
01:13:09,989 --> 01:13:11,786
Take back your filthy bauble, sir.

955
01:13:11,949 --> 01:13:15,305
And in the future, do not make me
a party to your low intrigues.

956
01:13:15,469 --> 01:13:18,859
- Yes, Mr. Curtis.
- This little present is for you, Sonya.

957
01:13:19,029 --> 01:13:22,021
Oh, how wonderful!

958
01:13:25,389 --> 01:13:28,222
"For my dear, sweet Sonya."

959
01:13:28,389 --> 01:13:31,142
- Oh, Martin! I love you, darling!
- Stop it! Stop it!

960
01:13:31,309 --> 01:13:34,824
- What is the meaning of this?
- Sonya, this is Mrs. Cortland.

961
01:13:36,269 --> 01:13:39,227
- Mrs. Cortland?
- Yes, my wife.

962
01:13:39,549 --> 01:13:41,187
The woman I treasure.

963
01:13:41,349 --> 01:13:45,103
Sonya, didn't you say something
about having possibly to leave the show?

964
01:13:45,269 --> 01:13:49,979
Why, yes. There's my sick uncle
and my sick cousin and...

965
01:13:50,149 --> 01:13:54,222
- And something might happen to you too.
- Yes.

966
01:13:54,389 --> 01:13:58,223
Well, I'm happy to have met you,
Mrs. Cortland.

967
01:14:01,869 --> 01:14:03,939
There goes your gal.

968
01:14:04,829 --> 01:14:06,660
Boys, back to the guardhouse.
Let's go.

969
01:14:06,829 --> 01:14:08,547
What do you mean?
What about the show?

970
01:14:08,709 --> 01:14:10,939
Show? Without a leading lady?
Ready, boys?

971
01:14:11,109 --> 01:14:12,861
Wait! There's Sheila. Get her back.

972
01:14:13,029 --> 01:14:15,179
She's going to Panama. However...

973
01:14:15,349 --> 01:14:20,662
...if you tried explaining what happened in
my apartment with "dear, sweet Sonya"...

974
01:14:22,709 --> 01:14:25,587
- I don't know what you're talking about.
- That's what I thought.

975
01:14:25,749 --> 01:14:29,788
Boys, it's my right to serve my sentence.
Take me back to the guardhouse.

976
01:14:29,949 --> 01:14:32,099
- Okay, soldier, let's go.
- Robert, my...

977
01:14:32,269 --> 01:14:34,100
Now, Martin, my pet...

978
01:14:34,269 --> 01:14:37,784
...l'm going to get to the bottom
of this Sonya matter if it's the last...

979
01:14:37,949 --> 01:14:44,184
Julia, I'm as innocent as a newborn babe,
or a little older, perhaps.

980
01:14:46,989 --> 01:14:49,901
Hey, Kewpie, Swivel Tongue,
where do you think I'm going?

981
01:14:50,069 --> 01:14:51,661
- Again?
- What happened?

982
01:14:51,829 --> 01:14:54,980
- Oh, nothing. Show's off, that's all.
- Off? How come?

983
01:14:55,149 --> 01:14:57,379
Miss Winthrop decided
to go to Panama instead.

984
01:14:57,549 --> 01:15:00,825
Now, I ask you,
disappointing all those poor soldiers...

985
01:15:00,989 --> 01:15:03,549
...is that fair of Miss Winthrop?
- It's a crime.

986
01:15:03,709 --> 01:15:06,746
That's what I think. Understand?

987
01:15:11,269 --> 01:15:13,146
Do you understand?

988
01:15:15,589 --> 01:15:17,147
Well, what are we waiting on?

989
01:15:17,469 --> 01:15:19,858
So you see,
she walks right out on the show.

990
01:15:20,029 --> 01:15:22,827
Yeah. They promised us a big shindig,
and it's off!

991
01:15:22,989 --> 01:15:25,662
- How do you like that?
- How did she get that way?

992
01:15:25,829 --> 01:15:27,820
These two fellas tell me
there's no show.

993
01:15:27,989 --> 01:15:29,581
What are we, soldiers or mice?

994
01:15:29,749 --> 01:15:33,378
- This Winthrop gal picks up and walks.
- What's the idea? She can't do that.

995
01:15:33,549 --> 01:15:36,586
I'm sorry, but if Uncle Sam
were to walk in here and ask me...

996
01:15:36,749 --> 01:15:38,467
...to go back into that show, I'd...

997
01:15:38,629 --> 01:15:41,268
We're all packed and ready to leave
on our honeymoon, sir.

998
01:15:41,429 --> 01:15:43,420
What's so important about a honeymoon?

999
01:15:43,589 --> 01:15:47,138
When you've been married 25 years,
as I have, you'll look back and wonder...

1000
01:15:47,309 --> 01:15:48,867
But never mind that.

1001
01:15:49,029 --> 01:15:52,146
One more word from you,
and I'll be forced to have you disciplined.

1002
01:15:52,309 --> 01:15:53,742
Yes, sir. Sorry, sir.

1003
01:15:53,909 --> 01:15:58,300
Now, here's a problem for that charming
Captain Curtis to handle.

1004
01:15:58,469 --> 01:16:00,744
I have a funny hunch
he's working on it.

1005
01:16:00,909 --> 01:16:03,503
- Miss Winthrop...
- You're wasting time, colonel.

1006
01:16:08,109 --> 01:16:11,181
You hear that? The whole
blooming Army is calling for you.

1007
01:16:11,349 --> 01:16:14,659
And I might say, that includes myself.

1008
01:16:18,629 --> 01:16:21,143
- Sheila's changed her mind.
- The show's on!

1009
01:16:21,309 --> 01:16:24,346
- Well, what a pleasant surprise.
- Come on, let's get going.

1010
01:16:24,509 --> 01:16:28,024
Yes, sir, just one second.
I got a little business about the show.

1011
01:16:29,589 --> 01:16:32,501
I put a big military wedding number
in this show for a purpose.

1012
01:16:32,669 --> 01:16:35,820
With Sheila and I
as bride and groom, see?

1013
01:16:35,989 --> 01:16:38,378
What I had in mind was...

1014
01:16:38,549 --> 01:16:42,747
...suppose you fellas got a real justice
of the peace to play that part?

1015
01:16:42,909 --> 01:16:45,821
That would save Miss Winthrop
that little trip to Panama.

1016
01:16:45,989 --> 01:16:47,422
See what I mean?

1017
01:16:48,189 --> 01:16:49,668
- Yeah.
- Sure.

1018
01:16:49,829 --> 01:16:53,185
All right. Get to work, and no slip-ups.
See you in the auditorium.

1019
01:16:53,349 --> 01:16:55,783
All right, kids. Let's go.

1020
01:17:03,069 --> 01:17:05,264
- Yes?
- It's going fine, don't you think?

1021
01:17:05,429 --> 01:17:08,262
One more number and it's over,
and that'll be even finer.

1022
01:17:08,429 --> 01:17:11,421
You're going to be the loveliest bride
anybody ever saw.

1023
01:17:11,629 --> 01:17:14,189
If you recall, the Army said,
"Just dance with him.

1024
01:17:14,349 --> 01:17:16,340
You don't have to talk to him."

1025
01:17:23,389 --> 01:17:28,747
Oh, here comes the bride, no less
It's hot stuff, that fluffy dress

1026
01:17:28,869 --> 01:17:33,659
I must admit, though she's lit
She looks a bit sweet

1027
01:17:34,029 --> 01:17:38,819
No wonder her Romeo
Begins shouting hi-de- ho

1028
01:17:38,949 --> 01:17:43,500
As his bride starts to stride
To a boogie beat

1029
01:17:44,549 --> 01:17:48,701
There's a big increase in marriages
Due to a tune, they say

1030
01:17:48,829 --> 01:17:54,745
The wedding cak e walk
Is the roundelay

1031
01:17:54,869 --> 01:17:59,624
When newlyweds in fancy carriages
Leave the reception gay

1032
01:17:59,749 --> 01:18:05,779
The wedding cak e walk
Sends them on their way

1033
01:18:05,909 --> 01:18:11,267
Pasty choirs in tasty churches
Give it all they got

1034
01:18:11,389 --> 01:18:16,668
Prudish old preachers on their perches
Say, "Amen, it's hot"

1035
01:18:16,789 --> 01:18:21,226
All those bridal suites at Claridge's
Have radios that play

1036
01:18:21,349 --> 01:18:26,548
The wedding cak e walk
Night and day

1037
01:19:24,989 --> 01:19:30,063
If any person can show cause why
they may not lawfully be joined together...

1038
01:19:30,229 --> 01:19:33,983
...let him now speak,
or forever hold his peace.

1039
01:19:34,189 --> 01:19:36,828
Do you take this woman
to be your lawful wedded wife?

1040
01:19:37,429 --> 01:19:38,942
I do.

1041
01:19:39,189 --> 01:19:41,703
Do you take this man
to be your lawful wedded husband?

1042
01:19:41,869 --> 01:19:42,904
I do.

1043
01:19:43,069 --> 01:19:48,348
In accordance with the authority vested
in me, I now pronounce you man and wife.

1044
01:22:19,869 --> 01:22:21,666
Will you stop,
the show is over.

1045
01:22:21,829 --> 01:22:24,263
The real show has just started,
Mrs. Curtis.

1046
01:22:24,429 --> 01:22:25,942
Mrs. What?

1047
01:22:26,109 --> 01:22:30,068
Ladies and gentlemen... Just in time,
Capt. Barton and my dear friend, Martin.

1048
01:22:30,229 --> 01:22:33,062
Listen, everybody,
Sheila and I are man and wife.

1049
01:22:33,229 --> 01:22:37,700
Yes, the man who performed the wedding
ceremony was a real justice of the peace.

1050
01:22:37,869 --> 01:22:41,179
You are, without a doubt, the...
Let go of me.

1051
01:22:41,509 --> 01:22:45,502
I believe Curtis was to be returned
to the guardhouse right after the show.

1052
01:22:45,669 --> 01:22:46,758
Come on, Curtis.

1053
01:22:50,509 --> 01:22:52,306
I'll have this annulled,
then have him arrested.

1054
01:22:52,469 --> 01:22:55,779
Think it over, darling.
A husband in jail is no use at all.

1055
01:22:58,029 --> 01:23:00,668
- You and your show!
- Listen, now that you're married...

1056
01:23:00,829 --> 01:23:02,979
...I can't let Robert
be tortured like this...

1057
01:23:03,149 --> 01:23:05,868
...so I've got to tell you,
I changed the name on the bracelet.

1058
01:23:06,029 --> 01:23:10,864
I framed the thing up in his apartment,
so that I could get Sonya into the show.

1059
01:23:11,029 --> 01:23:13,987
I'd have told you this before,
but that old G-woman of mine...

1060
01:23:14,149 --> 01:23:16,424
Oh, you darling!

1061
01:23:17,269 --> 01:23:19,737
I wonder if they have daylight saving
around here?

1062
01:23:26,229 --> 01:23:28,584
Hurry up, Swivel.
Curtis has to have a honeymoon.

1063
01:23:28,749 --> 01:23:30,944
He should've started digging
from the guardhouse.

1064
01:23:31,069 --> 01:23:32,866
Oh, shut up and dig.

1065
01:23:38,149 --> 01:23:40,105
Mrs. Curtis calling on her husband.

1066
01:23:40,269 --> 01:23:42,829
The last I heard, the Curtises
don't live here anymore.

1067
01:23:42,989 --> 01:23:45,184
They broke up, I heard.

1068
01:23:45,469 --> 01:23:47,346
I heard she might be
coming back to him.

1069
01:23:48,149 --> 01:23:49,901
You did?

1070
01:23:50,109 --> 01:23:52,703
But it's rather awkward
with the bridegroom behind bars.

1071
01:23:52,869 --> 01:23:54,507
Awkward? It's awful.

1072
01:23:54,869 --> 01:23:57,747
I could pitch a tent out here,
and we could look at each other.

1073
01:23:57,909 --> 01:23:59,422
Curtis.

1074
01:24:01,469 --> 01:24:05,223
On recommendation of Captain Barton,
I'm releasing you for your honeymoon.

1075
01:24:05,389 --> 01:24:07,061
Colonel, you're a sweetheart.

1076
01:24:07,229 --> 01:24:11,222
Oh, sorry, sir. Yes, sir.
Thank you, sir. Yes, sir. Thank you.

1077
01:24:16,909 --> 01:24:19,548
Curtis? Curtis?

1078
01:24:24,869 --> 01:24:27,099
I guess we're lost.
It's pretty foggy tonight.

1079
01:24:27,269 --> 01:24:29,464
Yes. You see, we had a date with...

1080
01:24:29,629 --> 01:24:33,099
we're going to China...

1081
01:24:53,749 --> 01:24:54,838
