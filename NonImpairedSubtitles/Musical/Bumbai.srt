1
00:02:55,520 --> 00:02:56,710
You've returned to the village
after 2 years, Shekhar.

2
00:02:57,190 --> 00:02:59,450
l can't keep myself from telling
you about what have happened here.

3
00:02:59,820 --> 00:03:01,480
- Can't you just shut up?
- But listen to me...

4
00:03:02,260 --> 00:03:05,130
You know Godu, the wrestler...?
He looks like a regular bull.

5
00:03:05,660 --> 00:03:08,260
- He used to be all brawns earlier...
- Are you crazy?

6
00:03:08,800 --> 00:03:11,930
And the sweetmeat vendor's wife
has eloped with a neighbor!

7
00:03:12,700 --> 00:03:15,600
- They met at the movies...
- l could slap you for that!

8
00:03:15,940 --> 00:03:18,430
The washerman's wife has delivered
a baby-girl again; their sixth one.

9
00:03:19,780 --> 00:03:21,440
But he's still as virile as ever!

10
00:03:30,190 --> 00:03:32,020
You can never say.
We had a good monsoon last year.

11
00:03:32,490 --> 00:03:33,350
Our crops were saved,
but otherwise...

12
00:04:30,910 --> 00:04:33,250
You swore never to step in this
house and went away to Bombay.

13
00:04:34,320 --> 00:04:35,370
But you have come back.

14
00:04:36,820 --> 00:04:39,080
- l could leave this instant.
- Sit down.

15
00:04:40,190 --> 00:04:42,710
- You still have a temper.
- l've got that trait from you.

16
00:04:43,560 --> 00:04:46,760
l mean... l've inherited
that aspect from you.

17
00:04:48,530 --> 00:04:50,830
Have you at least been studying well
all those miles away from home?

18
00:04:51,570 --> 00:04:53,000
He has passed with a First Class.

19
00:04:56,110 --> 00:04:58,570
So you've passed, all right.
What do you intend to do now?

20
00:05:02,380 --> 00:05:04,640
What do you intend to do
after your education?

21
00:05:05,180 --> 00:05:06,740
He has found a job in Bombay.

22
00:05:09,150 --> 00:05:11,810
He will work, and pursue
studies in journalism.

23
00:05:12,350 --> 00:05:17,290
You hear that, don't you?

24
00:05:18,130 --> 00:05:20,150
What's that ''ism''
you're going to study?

25
00:05:20,400 --> 00:05:24,560
Whatever it be, you will
need money for the fees.

26
00:05:26,000 --> 00:05:29,490
Who will pay that?
Money doesn't grow on trees.

27
00:05:29,870 --> 00:05:33,310
l've got a job as a proof-reader.
l will use my salary for my studies.

28
00:05:33,880 --> 00:05:37,640
Which means you don't need
your old man's help, isn't it?

29
00:05:41,980 --> 00:05:46,180
You want to stay in Bombay and
never return here! lsn't it?

30
00:05:48,460 --> 00:05:51,320
You don't plan to marry
a girl from Bombay, do you?

31
00:05:51,730 --> 00:05:53,820
- That will never be.
- Good.

32
00:05:55,600 --> 00:05:58,830
We are a widely respected
and cultured family.

33
00:06:00,370 --> 00:06:03,960
l won't tolerate it, if you bring
home a bride from another community.

34
00:06:04,570 --> 00:06:08,810
Better remember that.
And go ahead and eat now.

35
00:06:15,550 --> 00:06:18,420
Have l come home only to escort you
to weddings and functions?

36
00:06:18,750 --> 00:06:21,280
- ls it that much of a bother?
- Welcome, dear...

37
00:06:24,630 --> 00:06:26,990
This is Narayan Mishra's son.

38
00:06:28,660 --> 00:06:30,890
Didn't Dad say that a sister
is a brother's responsibility?

39
00:06:31,400 --> 00:06:33,600
What can he do, except talk?

40
00:06:35,040 --> 00:06:36,730
- Hasn't your father come?
- He's away in town.

41
00:06:40,480 --> 00:06:42,440
Remember me, Shekhar?
l used to teach you Hindi?

42
00:06:42,910 --> 00:06:44,040
Why, of course!

43
00:07:20,720 --> 00:13:07,590
DrGDrGDrGDrG

44
00:13:12,870 --> 00:13:15,030
This isn't right, Shekhar...
Listen to me!

45
00:13:15,770 --> 00:13:19,230
They won't spare you, if you go
ogling around in their locality.

46
00:13:20,310 --> 00:13:22,330
- But we're just standing here.
- Exactly! And that's wrong!

47
00:13:22,580 --> 00:13:23,670
Here comes Chitti Miyan!

48
00:13:24,350 --> 00:13:26,510
- Hold on...
- Why are you guys standing here?

49
00:13:26,820 --> 00:13:28,250
- Greeting, sir.
- Greetings.

50
00:13:29,320 --> 00:13:33,050
He went away. But they'd behead us,
if they knew we're here for a girl!

51
00:13:33,720 --> 00:13:36,050
- Let them do it.
- Why must l lose my head for you?

52
00:13:37,490 --> 00:13:38,550
There she comes!

53
00:13:47,040 --> 00:13:48,940
We've had it! We will now have
to face the Village Council!

54
00:13:53,110 --> 00:13:55,540
- Which one of them is her?
- How would l know?

55
00:13:59,050 --> 00:14:01,480
There's still time! Let's scram!

56
00:14:09,360 --> 00:14:11,420
- Could you recognize her?
- No.

57
00:14:13,060 --> 00:14:15,360
And you still take all the trouble?!
Let's get out of here!

58
00:14:16,230 --> 00:14:18,530
A veil has flown off the face
of one of those women, Shekhar!

59
00:14:29,540 --> 00:14:31,240
- The red bag!
- What?!

60
00:14:45,160 --> 00:14:47,150
- He's trying to woo you.
- Shut up.

61
00:14:48,100 --> 00:14:49,860
Don't pretend. l know everything.

62
00:14:59,540 --> 00:15:01,070
What's your name?

63
00:15:10,190 --> 00:15:11,480
Why are you standing by the door?

64
00:15:13,390 --> 00:15:16,360
- There's so much to do, Shaila.
- l'll join you in a moment.

65
00:15:24,230 --> 00:15:25,670
Well, lady? Are you crazy?

66
00:15:27,570 --> 00:15:28,870
You're mad!

67
00:15:53,160 --> 00:15:55,220
My father will never sign
this progress report.

68
00:16:04,670 --> 00:16:06,000
l won't be coming to school
from tomorrow.

69
00:16:21,260 --> 00:16:23,850
- Give me your bag. And take mine.
- What for?

70
00:16:24,330 --> 00:16:25,660
Don't argue. Just do it!

71
00:16:35,170 --> 00:16:36,360
Why did you give me your bag?

72
00:16:36,670 --> 00:16:38,040
- Listen...!
- Who's that?

73
00:16:39,410 --> 00:16:43,240
lt's you... with the red bag!

74
00:16:43,580 --> 00:16:44,880
Now l know why!

75
00:16:45,780 --> 00:16:47,180
Here he is!

76
00:16:57,360 --> 00:17:02,160
One moment, please... l don't know
how to tell you what l feel.

77
00:17:03,200 --> 00:17:04,460
But l'll tell you, for sure.

78
00:17:06,370 --> 00:17:08,560
Hey! Don't cry...
why are you crying?!

79
00:17:09,870 --> 00:17:11,130
l've said nothing to you!

80
00:17:16,850 --> 00:17:18,180
Who are you?

81
00:17:21,080 --> 00:17:27,250
This red bag!
l thought it was her...

82
00:17:57,650 --> 00:17:59,350
Come in.

83
00:18:00,490 --> 00:18:01,960
l want the Chemistry notes.

84
00:18:03,160 --> 00:18:04,390
Wait a minute.

85
00:18:07,960 --> 00:18:11,360
Laxmi has gone inside.

86
00:18:48,240 --> 00:18:49,790
Here you are, Bano.

87
00:18:50,470 --> 00:18:52,170
Don't forget to bring it
to class tomorrow...

88
00:19:08,920 --> 00:19:10,950
They'll cut off your hand
if you're caught, Shekhar!

89
00:19:11,490 --> 00:19:17,260
Why are you getting into trouble?
l'll find you a nice girl!

90
00:19:18,100 --> 00:19:20,500
- You can marry her yourself.
- l'm not talking about myself!

91
00:19:20,840 --> 00:19:23,430
l beg of you, Shekhar...
Please don't!

92
00:19:25,240 --> 00:19:26,800
Zeenat? Hurry up!

93
00:19:29,580 --> 00:19:32,270
- ls that Zeenat?
- Who else? lt's her of course.

94
00:19:32,580 --> 00:19:34,140
Look at her swaying her hips!

95
00:19:34,580 --> 00:19:36,780
Watch your step!
The earth might split!

96
00:19:37,290 --> 00:19:40,810
Why say that? She's not the
only one in town, is she?

97
00:19:42,190 --> 00:19:43,620
Careful... l hope
the boat doesn't sink.

98
00:19:46,490 --> 00:19:49,360
This is the limit!
Zeenat is not so bad.

99
00:19:52,930 --> 00:19:54,270
Didn't you say you wouldn't
be coming today?

100
00:19:56,340 --> 00:19:57,700
Has your father signed the report?

101
00:20:01,580 --> 00:20:02,800
Why aren't you
carrying your bag?

102
00:20:04,550 --> 00:20:05,840
How will you study
without the books?

103
00:20:11,990 --> 00:20:16,890
What's up, Bano?
Have you seen a snake?

104
00:20:17,390 --> 00:20:20,020
- Hold her firmly, Zeenat.
- lt's okay...

105
00:20:20,300 --> 00:20:22,820
- Hold her, l say.
- Yes. Or she'll fall in the water.

106
00:20:23,500 --> 00:20:24,900
Go ahead... hold her!

107
00:20:36,280 --> 00:20:37,710
l could give up everything for you.

108
00:20:39,480 --> 00:20:40,610
Could you do that for me?

109
00:20:45,220 --> 00:20:46,710
l could die for you.

110
00:20:52,590 --> 00:20:56,190
l'll wait for you at the old fort.
Do come over, if you love me.

111
00:21:07,140 --> 00:21:09,340
- l've brought the kerosene, mom.
- You're late.

112
00:21:09,840 --> 00:21:11,310
There was a big queue
at the provision store.

113
00:21:31,170 --> 00:21:33,100
Look at the winds...
l think it's going to rain.

114
00:21:33,370 --> 00:21:36,340
Help me with the stuff we're
drying in the courtyard, Bano.

115
00:21:45,810 --> 00:21:47,410
Zeenat's looking for you, Bano.

116
00:22:08,540 --> 00:29:07,450
DrGDrGDrGDrG

117
00:29:35,920 --> 00:29:38,280
My name is Shekhar.
l'm Mr. Mishra's youngest son.

118
00:29:38,650 --> 00:29:39,810
l know that. Please sit down.

119
00:29:42,690 --> 00:29:44,780
Ask someone to fetch
some tea, Shamim.

120
00:29:45,560 --> 00:29:46,890
lt's okay. Don't bother.

121
00:29:47,400 --> 00:29:49,420
How can that be, son?
You've come visiting us.

122
00:29:51,770 --> 00:29:54,100
l work for a newspaper
in Bombay.

123
00:29:55,200 --> 00:29:56,400
l'm also doing a course
in journalism.

124
00:29:57,540 --> 00:30:00,670
l'm a small-town man. l wouldn't
know of all those things.

125
00:30:01,740 --> 00:30:03,540
l...

126
00:30:05,950 --> 00:30:09,780
Your daughter Shaila Bano and l
want to get married.

127
00:30:11,720 --> 00:30:14,850
Get out!

128
00:30:15,460 --> 00:30:19,290
D'you realize whom you are
talking to, you swine?!

129
00:30:22,430 --> 00:30:25,020
l've just said my prayers! Or l'd
have hacked you to pieces right now!

130
00:30:25,900 --> 00:30:28,430
Do you hear him? He's asking for
our daughter's hand in marriage!

131
00:30:28,940 --> 00:30:31,400
l haven't come to ask for it...
We just wanted to inform our elders.

132
00:30:39,410 --> 00:30:40,680
- Father!
- Leave me alone!

133
00:30:42,450 --> 00:30:45,250
- Father...!
- Go inside!

134
00:30:51,130 --> 00:30:54,460
Provoke me anymore and you
will be a bundle of pieces!

135
00:30:55,630 --> 00:30:56,930
How dare you?!

136
00:30:57,900 --> 00:30:59,830
Who are you? And who are we?

137
00:31:00,270 --> 00:31:02,100
Even our blood is different!
They can never be one!

138
00:31:09,240 --> 00:31:10,370
Show me your hand.

139
00:31:16,880 --> 00:31:18,250
We will certainly be one!

140
00:31:34,200 --> 00:31:37,170
- Where's the young master?
- He's inside.

141
00:31:39,210 --> 00:31:42,570
How did you suffer this
injury on your palm?

142
00:31:43,140 --> 00:31:44,510
lt's nothing. Just bandage it.

143
00:31:44,750 --> 00:31:47,040
Shivram of Palanpur has asked
for Shekhar's horoscope...

144
00:31:47,450 --> 00:31:48,920
...to match it with that
of his daughter's.

145
00:31:49,420 --> 00:31:50,610
Just tell him that.

146
00:31:50,990 --> 00:31:52,450
Hear that? lt's Shivram's
daughter for you.

147
00:31:53,350 --> 00:31:56,120
- Why isn't he speaking up?
- Tell them we're not interested.

148
00:31:56,820 --> 00:31:57,950
Your father's coming in.

149
00:31:58,230 --> 00:32:01,290
For how long will you live on the
food of restaurants in Bombay?

150
00:32:01,930 --> 00:32:05,390
Tell him that they're a good family
and the girl is nice, too.

151
00:32:05,800 --> 00:32:08,560
She'll soon be a graduate. Ask him
to go and take a look at her.

152
00:32:08,940 --> 00:32:09,870
l don't want to.

153
00:32:15,780 --> 00:32:18,840
- Why not?
- l know when and how l'll marry.

154
00:32:21,020 --> 00:32:23,140
This is a new one...
but what is it all about?

155
00:32:27,020 --> 00:32:29,620
- l've found the girl l wanted.
- l see.

156
00:32:31,090 --> 00:32:34,120
Wonderful... but where is she?

157
00:32:36,200 --> 00:32:40,130
ln Bombay? Does she belong
to another community?

158
00:32:42,000 --> 00:32:43,660
This is precisely why l didn't
want him to go to Bombay!

159
00:32:43,900 --> 00:32:45,930
She's from our village.

160
00:32:46,970 --> 00:32:52,500
Really? Who is she?
Tell me who she is!

161
00:32:53,010 --> 00:32:54,570
- You'll kick up a fuss, if l...
- Tell me who she is!

162
00:32:56,420 --> 00:32:57,980
lt's Shaila Bano.

163
00:33:05,160 --> 00:33:06,290
Bashir Ahmed's daughter.

164
00:33:12,070 --> 00:33:14,730
ls it Bashir... who owns
the brick-kiln?

165
00:33:19,140 --> 00:33:24,370
Hari... where are you, son?

166
00:33:25,210 --> 00:33:26,650
- What is it, dad?
- Let's go.

167
00:33:40,860 --> 00:33:48,360
Call Bashir... tell him Narayan
Mishra is here to see him.

168
00:33:57,810 --> 00:34:01,580
There will be bloodshed if your
daughter meets my son again, Bashir!

169
00:34:02,120 --> 00:34:04,550
l'm a poor man, but l have
my self-respect, mind you!

170
00:34:05,320 --> 00:34:09,090
lf anyone plays foul, both our
families will be wiped out!

171
00:34:09,590 --> 00:34:11,620
You thought you can ensnare a rich
and educated man, did you?

172
00:34:12,130 --> 00:34:13,320
Who wants your wealth or him?

173
00:34:13,590 --> 00:34:14,890
- l'm satisfied with my respect...
- Am l not respected then?

174
00:34:15,130 --> 00:34:17,930
- Don't put words in my mouth.
- You can't handle your girl...

175
00:34:18,300 --> 00:34:19,390
...and you dare back-answer me!

176
00:34:19,670 --> 00:34:21,900
l send the girl to school and you
guys follow her like hungry dogs!

177
00:34:22,670 --> 00:34:25,610
- Whom did you call a dog?
- You're lucky...

178
00:34:25,870 --> 00:34:27,700
...l let your son walk away
without a scratch!

179
00:34:28,010 --> 00:34:30,530
l'll see who harms whom!

180
00:34:30,810 --> 00:34:33,180
Give me that sickle...
l'll hack this guy today!

181
00:34:37,590 --> 00:34:39,550
lf you guys start a riot, the matter
will go the Village Council...

182
00:34:39,920 --> 00:34:42,010
...and both families will have
to leave the village!

183
00:34:42,520 --> 00:34:44,510
Let's see how anyone throws us
out of the village!

184
00:34:45,090 --> 00:34:47,490
Give us the nod, sir!
We'll chop these guys to pieces!

185
00:34:48,600 --> 00:34:51,030
Try touching us, if you dare!
And see what l'll do to you!

186
00:34:53,300 --> 00:34:57,430
Stop it! What are you guys doing?!
Stop it, l say!

187
00:34:59,210 --> 00:35:00,730
Stop it, l say!

188
00:35:02,440 --> 00:35:05,880
What are you up to?
This is between the two of us!

189
00:35:06,410 --> 00:35:08,880
And why are you crying murder?
Go away!

190
00:35:09,380 --> 00:35:11,940
Please go away.

191
00:35:16,220 --> 00:35:20,220
This isn't right, Bashir...
lt's simply not done!

192
00:35:20,590 --> 00:35:23,620
Don't do this to me.

193
00:36:09,340 --> 00:36:10,440
Are you satisfied now?

194
00:36:14,880 --> 00:36:18,980
My respect has been brought to dust!
Are you happy?

195
00:36:20,090 --> 00:36:22,250
- What's wrong, father?
- What could be worse?

196
00:36:23,090 --> 00:36:28,260
Has there been a day when we have
not visited the temple? Tell me.

197
00:36:30,330 --> 00:36:32,200
l have been a trustee of
the temple for 20 years.

198
00:36:32,700 --> 00:36:35,460
The management dare not take a
decision without consulting me.

199
00:36:36,370 --> 00:36:37,430
That's the kind of
respect l command.

200
00:36:38,770 --> 00:36:41,740
lt's our house the deity is brought
to first, during any festival.

201
00:36:43,540 --> 00:36:45,030
But how and why will the deity
be brought here anymore?

202
00:36:45,780 --> 00:36:49,910
My son falls in love
with a Muslim girl...

203
00:36:50,550 --> 00:36:53,080
...and her father goes around
threatening to slaughter us!

204
00:36:54,520 --> 00:36:55,920
What the hell is all this?

205
00:36:58,230 --> 00:37:02,030
l give up! l surrender to
the educated young man!

206
00:37:03,400 --> 00:37:06,130
Shaila Bano is a good girl.
She studies in the same school...

207
00:37:06,370 --> 00:37:07,700
Shut up!

208
00:37:09,140 --> 00:37:12,940
lf he marries her, who will
accept you for a bride?

209
00:37:13,540 --> 00:37:14,940
We can find a Muslim for her, too.

210
00:37:15,910 --> 00:37:17,880
l could knock your teeth
out with a slap!

211
00:37:19,780 --> 00:37:22,910
l let you go, because
you have grown up.

212
00:37:23,520 --> 00:37:26,150
- lmpudent rascal!
- ls it wrong to love a Muslim?

213
00:37:26,890 --> 00:37:28,120
Are the Muslims our enemies?

214
00:37:29,020 --> 00:37:33,820
All right! Marry her...
after l'm dead.

215
00:37:34,660 --> 00:37:36,130
l can't wait for you to die.

216
00:37:38,970 --> 00:37:40,190
What did you say?

217
00:37:42,270 --> 00:37:44,860
What is this chap saying?!

218
00:37:46,270 --> 00:37:50,470
You are the son l begot
after a lot of prayers.

219
00:37:51,010 --> 00:37:55,040
You will take my advise, if
you have any love for me.

220
00:37:57,790 --> 00:38:00,150
lf you must marry
that Muslim girl...

221
00:38:02,120 --> 00:38:05,520
...you might as well
mourn my death first!

222
00:38:06,030 --> 00:38:07,550
How can you say such things?

223
00:38:08,330 --> 00:38:10,660
Shekhar!
Seek your father's forgiveness.

224
00:38:14,170 --> 00:38:18,400
l'm going away to Bombay, father.

225
00:38:19,970 --> 00:38:21,130
l will never return.

226
00:39:49,600 --> 00:39:53,120
How are you, grandma?

227
00:39:54,400 --> 00:39:55,990
- Where's Bano?
- There she is.

228
00:40:52,860 --> 00:40:57,390
Bano! Where are you?

229
00:41:08,010 --> 00:41:09,070
ls what your mother saying true?

230
00:41:10,440 --> 00:41:11,410
Speak up!

231
00:41:14,350 --> 00:41:16,440
Has Narayan Mishra's son been
writing to you from Bombay?

232
00:41:18,220 --> 00:41:19,240
Answer me... !

233
00:41:27,490 --> 00:41:30,220
Do you want me in a position where
l can't face anyone out of shame?

234
00:41:32,300 --> 00:41:33,630
l'll hack you to pieces!

235
00:41:34,630 --> 00:41:37,870
And you women! Can't you
take care of a single girl?

236
00:41:39,710 --> 00:41:40,930
Don't you cry! Shut up!

237
00:41:43,740 --> 00:41:46,110
You were born, when l returned from
a pilgrimage of the Holy Mecca.

238
00:41:47,450 --> 00:41:52,650
Whom am l slogging and working hard
for? lt's for you, isn't it?

239
00:41:53,650 --> 00:41:56,140
Haven't you ruined everything
by doing all this?

240
00:41:57,220 --> 00:42:00,920
Promise me... that you will
never make such a mistake again.

241
00:42:10,240 --> 00:42:11,970
l'm going to get you married
in less than 10 days!

242
00:42:12,770 --> 00:42:14,370
l will have my way!

243
00:44:19,300 --> 00:44:20,530
How about going and
getting married?

244
00:44:32,450 --> 00:44:34,570
- Listen...
- What is it?

245
00:44:35,380 --> 00:44:36,540
Are you scared?

246
00:44:40,420 --> 00:44:41,790
Why is my heart beating so fast?

247
00:44:43,160 --> 00:44:44,620
But l won't cry.

248
00:44:45,930 --> 00:44:48,330
l won't cry, will l?

249
00:45:01,640 --> 00:45:02,870
Please hold my hand.

250
00:45:09,250 --> 00:45:10,340
Sit down.

251
00:45:10,820 --> 00:45:12,410
- ls your name Shekhar?
- Yes. Shekhar Mishra.

252
00:45:12,750 --> 00:45:13,880
- Have you got the certificates?
- Sure.

253
00:45:16,290 --> 00:45:17,590
l got our names registered
a month in advance.

254
00:45:17,960 --> 00:45:20,930
Do you have the witnesses?

255
00:45:21,700 --> 00:45:22,890
Yes. There they are.

256
00:45:24,700 --> 00:45:28,230
- Who are they?
- My colleagues at the press.

257
00:45:28,800 --> 00:45:30,630
- Aren't you from Bombay?
- Not at all!

258
00:45:30,970 --> 00:45:34,570
We're both from Malanpur;
it's on the coast.

259
00:45:35,240 --> 00:45:38,640
Actually, my forefathers
are from Hyderabad.

260
00:45:39,350 --> 00:45:41,910
We're both from the same village;
but he's been here for 2 years now.

261
00:45:43,480 --> 00:45:45,110
l've arrived only this morning.

262
00:45:48,560 --> 00:45:49,780
lt's your turn next.

263
00:45:53,330 --> 00:45:54,990
- Did l say something wrong?
- No.

264
00:45:56,360 --> 00:45:57,760
Then why did you stop me?

265
00:45:59,400 --> 00:46:01,030
The sooner you stop talking,
the sooner he'd have left.

266
00:46:01,430 --> 00:46:03,200
And the sooner he had left,
the sooner we'd get married.

267
00:46:03,840 --> 00:46:06,400
And the sooner we are married,
l'd be able to give you a kiss.

268
00:46:13,210 --> 00:46:14,910
- Your name?
- Shekhar...

269
00:46:15,380 --> 00:46:17,040
- Your father's name?
- Narayan Mishra.

270
00:46:17,820 --> 00:46:19,580
- And what is your name?
- Tell him your name.

271
00:46:20,420 --> 00:46:21,480
Shaila Bano.

272
00:47:54,950 --> 00:47:55,970
Well, Shekhar?!

273
00:47:58,750 --> 00:48:01,480
Who's that girl with you?
You've ditched me, haven't you?!

274
00:48:02,260 --> 00:48:05,490
You've ditched me and married
her, haven't you, darling?

275
00:48:06,290 --> 00:48:08,950
l couldn't help it! Her father held
a knife to my throat...

276
00:48:09,230 --> 00:48:11,200
...and threatened to kill me if
l didn't marry his daughter.

277
00:48:11,560 --> 00:48:13,760
- So l married her.
- Please don't believe him.

278
00:48:17,500 --> 00:48:20,940
...like a true maiden!

279
00:48:21,740 --> 00:48:25,110
But you mustn't let him loose!
Hold him tightly...

280
00:48:25,750 --> 00:48:27,840
...or the guy will flee!

281
00:48:42,200 --> 00:48:43,530
- Who's that?
- lt's me.. Shekhar.

282
00:48:47,870 --> 00:48:50,170
Mr. Malgaonkar... This is my
wife; we got married today.

283
00:48:50,800 --> 00:48:51,830
- Greetings!
- Greetings.

284
00:48:52,270 --> 00:48:54,210
Congratulations! Do you hear?

285
00:48:54,810 --> 00:48:57,440
- He has got married.
- You didn't even tell us.

286
00:48:58,650 --> 00:49:00,410
- And what is your name?
- Bano.

287
00:49:13,530 --> 00:49:16,090
- Yes, l'm a Muslim.
- Have you already married?

288
00:49:16,760 --> 00:49:19,700
- Just keep quiet!
- Why? Shouldn't he have told us?

289
00:49:20,170 --> 00:49:22,630
How can we say our prayers
with the girl around?

290
00:49:23,100 --> 00:49:25,230
Just come with me... Come on.

291
00:49:47,160 --> 00:49:50,820
They have guests from Solapur, whose
kids will stay in our room for 3 days.

292
00:49:51,200 --> 00:49:52,720
ls that all?

293
00:51:44,580 --> 00:51:46,200
We're having a great
nuptial night, aren't we?

294
00:51:47,210 --> 00:51:50,740
lt's not just tonight... it's going
to be like this for a few more days.

295
00:51:51,650 --> 00:51:53,350
- What did she say?
- Shut up and go to sleep.

296
00:51:58,160 --> 00:52:00,590
There he is... let's go.
The groom is back at work!

297
00:52:05,370 --> 00:52:08,330
- How's everything, Shekhar?
- His eyes are red!

298
00:52:08,840 --> 00:52:10,270
What's wrong?
Aren't you feeling well?

299
00:52:10,800 --> 00:52:13,200
How did it go?
lt was fun, wasn't it?

300
00:52:13,540 --> 00:52:14,900
Didn't you sleep
all of last night?

301
00:52:17,480 --> 00:52:21,780
This is no time for jokes!

302
00:52:22,820 --> 00:52:25,810
Please leave him to his work.

303
00:52:30,190 --> 00:52:36,220
Your eyes are red, Shekhar...
You look tired.

304
00:52:37,900 --> 00:52:39,890
You mustn't have slept
all night, l guess!

305
00:52:50,310 --> 00:52:53,510
''Dear Mother,
l have got married...''

306
00:52:54,380 --> 00:52:58,780
''...without an engagement
or any other ceremony...''

307
00:53:00,090 --> 00:53:03,580
''l have got married, even though
my parents were not present here''

308
00:53:04,320 --> 00:53:05,980
''l have eloped to get married...''

309
00:53:06,560 --> 00:53:08,050
''...please forgive me for that''

310
00:53:08,730 --> 00:53:10,750
''Do find the right time
to talk to father''

311
00:53:11,600 --> 00:53:13,460
''Despite the anger
he has against me...''

312
00:53:14,170 --> 00:53:15,660
''no one can deny that
l'm his daughter''

313
00:53:16,240 --> 00:53:20,170
''l'm very happy here, Mother''

314
00:54:24,470 --> 00:54:25,530
What is it?

315
00:54:30,380 --> 00:54:34,210
Didn't you say you wouldn't
arrive before 10 tonight?

316
00:54:39,220 --> 00:54:41,080
l have yet to embrace
my bride even once...

317
00:54:42,390 --> 00:54:43,650
...and how...

318
00:54:46,230 --> 00:54:48,020
...how can l study journalism
in this state of mind?

319
00:54:48,630 --> 00:54:51,500
You used to earlier; you must
continue in the same manner.

320
00:54:52,500 --> 00:54:54,690
- l wasn't married then!
- So what if you're married now?

321
00:54:59,670 --> 00:55:01,370
Let me go!
What if someone sees us?

322
00:55:01,910 --> 00:55:04,340
So what?!
We got married just yesterday!

323
00:55:05,180 --> 00:55:06,810
Wait till we get to our room!

324
00:55:07,780 --> 00:55:10,080
- lt's full of brats!
- You should be patient!

325
00:55:10,350 --> 00:55:12,680
How can l? Thousands must have
been married after us!

326
00:55:12,990 --> 00:55:14,210
And by now, they must have...

327
00:55:26,630 --> 00:55:29,030
lt's for you.

328
00:55:36,110 --> 00:55:41,010
Madam! l'm extremely sorry!
Please forgive me!

329
00:55:42,010 --> 00:55:43,240
There's a letter for you.

330
00:55:56,100 --> 00:55:57,290
There's a letter from your folks.

331
00:55:57,960 --> 00:55:59,230
Yes. Dad has written to me.

332
00:56:01,500 --> 00:56:04,630
- Won't you read it?
- l'll read it later.

333
00:56:06,310 --> 00:56:07,830
l won't be able to concentrate
on what l'm cooking.

334
00:56:08,540 --> 00:56:11,370
l'll keep trying to figure out
what he has written to you.

335
00:56:11,940 --> 00:56:13,410
And we'll have a fight
if l read it right now.

336
00:56:14,150 --> 00:56:17,080
No way! That will never happen.

337
00:56:23,260 --> 00:56:25,220
- He has sent some money.
- That hasn't made me angry!

338
00:56:30,060 --> 00:56:31,320
ln the name of Shiva...

339
00:56:32,700 --> 00:56:37,900
''l've given you up for dead, but
your mother cannot forget you''

340
00:56:39,410 --> 00:56:41,810
''Your brother took your mother
to the doctor.''

341
00:56:42,440 --> 00:56:43,910
''She has High Blood Pressure;
you know why''

342
00:56:44,180 --> 00:56:50,340
- What kind of a girl is she...
- Go on.

343
00:56:52,220 --> 00:56:55,280
''She's a shameless girl to desert her
family and run away with a stranger''

344
00:56:55,690 --> 00:56:57,350
''Her parents are no better who have
forgotten their daughter and...''

345
00:56:58,490 --> 00:57:01,480
My parents are not so bad!

346
00:57:03,360 --> 00:57:04,560
Which is why l didn't
want to read it.

347
00:57:06,900 --> 00:57:09,490
They can call me what they wish!
Why bad-mouth my parents?

348
00:57:11,340 --> 00:57:12,860
Have l ever said anything
against your folks?

349
00:57:14,170 --> 00:57:15,370
lt's what they have written.
How can l help it?

350
00:57:17,640 --> 00:57:18,770
Read what else is written.

351
00:57:22,420 --> 00:57:24,610
- l know she's a good girl, but...
- Don't fabricate things!

352
00:57:24,880 --> 00:57:27,180
Read what he has written!

353
00:57:34,130 --> 00:57:35,220
l'll return his money right now!

354
00:58:02,760 --> 00:58:04,620
''l can understand why you were
in a hurry to marry her''

355
00:58:05,320 --> 00:58:06,920
''l'm sending you a thousand
rupees with this letter''

356
00:58:07,430 --> 00:58:10,520
''Take her to a good hospital and
abort the bundle of your sins...''

357
00:58:10,800 --> 00:58:12,320
''...and send her away
to her parents''

358
00:58:39,060 --> 00:58:42,190
Tell her that l'm sorry.

359
00:58:44,000 --> 00:58:46,560
- Tell her that he's sorry.
- Say sorry to her.

360
00:58:47,470 --> 00:58:50,130
- Say sorry to her...
- Say sorry to her...

361
00:58:54,440 --> 00:58:55,600
Tell him it's okay.

362
00:59:03,120 --> 00:59:04,380
Ask her if l must
change my religion.

363
00:59:05,520 --> 00:59:07,150
- Pardon me?
- Must l embrace her religion?

364
00:59:08,090 --> 00:59:09,080
Must he change his religion?

365
00:59:09,760 --> 00:59:12,190
Must he change his religion?

366
00:59:20,670 --> 00:59:22,430
- No. He shouldn't.
- He shouldn't.

367
00:59:27,470 --> 00:59:29,940
You shouldn't, she says.

368
00:59:31,180 --> 00:59:32,640
Say ''l love you'' to her.

369
00:59:33,750 --> 00:59:35,300
''l love you'', he says!

370
00:59:45,420 --> 00:59:48,150
You promised to marry me
and ditched me, didn't you?

371
00:59:48,730 --> 00:59:51,990
No way! l will marry you
the next time l am born.

372
00:59:52,700 --> 00:59:54,030
- How about me?
- l'll marry you, too.

373
00:59:55,000 --> 00:59:57,730
Looks like an old involvement.

374
01:00:04,110 --> 01:00:05,080
Know what? He says
''l love you'' !

375
01:00:05,950 --> 01:00:07,110
Shut up, fatso!

376
01:00:10,480 --> 01:00:13,610
The landlady approves of you.
She has sent the relatives away.

377
01:00:14,050 --> 01:00:16,320
What are you up to out here?
This is no railway platform!

378
01:00:16,990 --> 01:00:17,980
Go to your room!

379
01:00:53,630 --> 01:05:14,850
DrGDrGDrGDrG

380
01:05:53,890 --> 01:05:56,260
- You ?!
- Who else could it be?

381
01:05:58,430 --> 01:05:59,900
l forgot where l was.

382
01:06:01,800 --> 01:06:02,790
l was startled.

383
01:06:06,270 --> 01:06:07,600
What's this?

384
01:06:32,100 --> 01:06:34,160
l had a daughter who
is now dead.

385
01:06:35,070 --> 01:06:36,660
l don't want people coming here
as her relatives.

386
01:06:37,570 --> 01:06:40,700
Never in this birth will l come here
for that relationship.

387
01:06:41,610 --> 01:06:42,570
l've come here for bricks.

388
01:06:43,680 --> 01:06:48,480
Ask him if they're available.
We need a truck-load in U.P.

389
01:06:49,210 --> 01:06:51,080
Why come to me for bricks
in Uttar Pradesh?

390
01:06:51,380 --> 01:06:56,220
He's talking nonsense. What will it
cost and when will he deliver them?

391
01:06:56,760 --> 01:06:58,990
Tell him that a truck-load
will cost him 2,000 Rupees.

392
01:06:59,320 --> 01:07:04,560
This is the advance.

393
01:07:05,830 --> 01:07:07,730
l want the name of Lord Rama
inscribed on every brick.

394
01:07:09,030 --> 01:07:10,970
- What did you say?!
- l want the bricks...

395
01:07:11,270 --> 01:07:13,530
...for Rama's temple in Ayodhya!

396
01:07:13,970 --> 01:07:15,870
l am sponsoring the bricks
from this village!

397
01:07:28,050 --> 01:07:30,890
- Not more than 3 Rupees for this.
- No, madam. l can't afford it.

398
01:07:31,760 --> 01:07:32,850
Pay him 3 Rupees.

399
01:07:33,460 --> 01:07:35,430
You fleece people the moment
you see someone gullible!

400
01:07:35,960 --> 01:07:37,790
Can l take my wife away
for a moment, please?

401
01:07:45,570 --> 01:07:48,170
l've been promoted!
l'm a reporter now!

402
01:07:50,410 --> 01:07:52,430
l'll get a salary
of 2,000 Rupees!

403
01:07:54,080 --> 01:07:55,600
You have brought me luck!

404
01:07:56,620 --> 01:08:01,480
l know it all! l know how
you have left me pining!

405
01:08:01,950 --> 01:08:04,180
- Not at all...
- You're a wicked man!

406
01:08:04,460 --> 01:08:05,750
l'm not a wicked man, Maniben!

407
01:08:25,310 --> 01:08:26,240
Later...

408
01:08:45,230 --> 01:08:46,790
- May l tell you something?
- Not now.

409
01:09:04,980 --> 01:09:06,780
What could l do, if
the cooker went off?

410
01:09:11,890 --> 01:09:13,220
lt fell down,
because l panicked.

411
01:09:14,730 --> 01:09:16,090
lt's you who always has me
running scared.

412
01:09:26,070 --> 01:09:27,370
l only asked for a minute.

413
01:09:30,380 --> 01:09:31,770
l had to tell you
something important.

414
01:09:33,550 --> 01:09:35,910
By now, l'd have
told you everything.

415
01:09:42,720 --> 01:09:44,420
lt's difficult to keep such
a secret... it's a burden.

416
01:09:49,430 --> 01:09:51,760
What is it?
What did you want to tell me?

417
01:10:21,560 --> 01:10:22,580
How will we manage?

418
01:10:22,830 --> 01:10:23,800
Allah will...

419
01:10:26,900 --> 01:10:30,160
Our children will have two Gods;
They'll manage it for us.

420
01:12:20,980 --> 01:12:22,450
My master is here to see you.

421
01:12:34,360 --> 01:12:35,920
Your daughter has
written a letter to me.

422
01:12:36,330 --> 01:12:38,800
- She is not my daughter.
- That's what l thought, too!

423
01:12:39,600 --> 01:12:41,260
We don't mean anything to them.

424
01:12:42,270 --> 01:12:45,900
They ran away and got married.
And they're now having a baby.

425
01:12:46,870 --> 01:12:49,360
A baby? Thank You, Almighty!

426
01:12:50,110 --> 01:12:52,700
She wrote to convey that,
without telling my son.

427
01:12:53,080 --> 01:12:55,210
Don't use this excuse to forge
a relation with me, okay?

428
01:12:55,450 --> 01:12:56,910
Who'd want you for a relative?!

429
01:12:57,450 --> 01:12:59,780
Just don't drag the baby
into our enmity!

430
01:13:00,590 --> 01:13:01,480
l'm leaving now.

431
01:13:04,490 --> 01:13:07,750
And just remember; the child
will follow my religion.

432
01:13:08,630 --> 01:13:09,690
Why will he follow your religion?

433
01:13:10,000 --> 01:13:11,660
lt's the father's religion that
the children follow!

434
01:13:12,060 --> 01:13:15,160
No way! lt's the mother's religion
the children must follow.

435
01:13:15,600 --> 01:13:17,830
The child will be a Hindu!
Not a Muslim!

436
01:13:18,140 --> 01:13:20,800
He will follow our religion!
He will be a Muslim!

437
01:13:21,070 --> 01:13:23,340
Try as you may, he will pray at
the temple, not in the mosques!

438
01:13:23,840 --> 01:13:26,370
l'll make him a devout Muslim
in the mosques!

439
01:13:26,750 --> 01:13:28,610
l'll teach him the Texts in the
wee hours of the morning!

440
01:13:29,180 --> 01:13:30,580
Let's see how you do it!

441
01:13:32,250 --> 01:13:34,910
As if l'd let him touch the boy!
He's always bragging.

442
01:13:43,360 --> 01:13:46,520
Wait there... Whom did you ask
before bringing all that here?

443
01:13:46,930 --> 01:13:48,960
This is a custom the bride's
parents must perform...

444
01:13:49,230 --> 01:13:51,260
...before their daughter
delivers the baby.

445
01:13:51,570 --> 01:13:54,900
No thank you! You'll kick up
a storm! Please go away.

446
01:13:55,240 --> 01:13:58,870
ls it okay to send them away, when
they've come to perform a ritual?

447
01:13:59,950 --> 01:14:02,680
- l thought you wouldn't...
- They aren't doing it for us.

448
01:14:04,050 --> 01:14:06,310
lt's for the baby.
Take them inside.
