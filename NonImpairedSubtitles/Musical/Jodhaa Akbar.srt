4
00:02:52,067 --> 00:02:55,467
This is Hindustan!

5
00:02:56,000 --> 00:02:58,467
History is witness to many...

6
00:02:58,533 --> 00:03:01,600
...dynasties who have
ruled with sword and blood,

7
00:03:02,800 --> 00:03:05,333
Since 1011 AD, countless invaders...

8
00:03:05,467 --> 00:03:10,000
...have ravaged and plundered this land,

9
00:03:14,667 --> 00:03:17,467
And then came, the Mughals,

10
00:03:18,267 --> 00:03:23,000
They made lndia their home,
giving it love and respect,

11
00:03:25,000 --> 00:03:30,800
Founded by Babur, the Mughal Dynasty
passed from Humayun to his son, Akbar,

12
00:03:31,467 --> 00:03:35,200
Among all the Mughal Emperors,
Akbar achieved the greatest heights -

13
00:03:36,333 --> 00:03:39,000
jalaluddin Mohammad Akbar!

14
00:03:39,733 --> 00:03:45,067
The first Mughal Emperor
to be born on lndian soil...

15
00:03:45,467 --> 00:03:48,667
...Akbar was born in
a Hindu Rajput home,

16
00:03:53,067 --> 00:03:56,200
And there was Princess jodhaa...

17
00:03:57,067 --> 00:04:00,000
...who was also born in Rajputana,

18
00:04:01,333 --> 00:04:03,067
In Amer,

19
00:04:05,200 --> 00:04:07,333
Daughter of King Bharmal...

20
00:04:07,733 --> 00:04:11,000
...and Queen Padmavati,

21
00:04:12,067 --> 00:04:14,200
jodhaa was betrothed...

22
00:04:14,733 --> 00:04:18,467
...to Prince Ratan
Singh of Ajabgarh,

23
00:04:25,933 --> 00:04:29,800
The Rajputs - were taught
the art of combat from childhood...

24
00:04:31,067 --> 00:04:33,600
...to protect their
families and homes...

25
00:04:34,067 --> 00:04:36,000
...and kingdom!

26
00:04:39,333 --> 00:04:40,533
Maan Singh!

27
00:04:41,467 --> 00:04:42,933
Brother Sujamal!

28
00:04:43,067 --> 00:04:47,000
Among the warriors,
was Prince Sujamal...

29
00:04:47,333 --> 00:04:49,000
...jodhaa's cousin,

30
00:04:50,200 --> 00:04:52,733
Sujamal loved jodhaa like a sister,

31
00:04:53,467 --> 00:04:55,867
He was by her side
whenever she beckoned,

32
00:04:56,267 --> 00:04:58,333
You can make a better painting!

33
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:05,067
Bharmal was crowned King,
following the demise of Sujamal's father,

34
00:05:05,867 --> 00:05:08,067
Sujamal was left isolated...

35
00:05:08,667 --> 00:05:13,067
...because his destiny
would take him far from Amer,

36
00:05:13,867 --> 00:05:17,533
Princess jodhaa's future
too would lead her...

37
00:05:17,733 --> 00:05:21,467
...away from
the Rajputana provinces,

38
00:05:24,200 --> 00:05:27,467
And now, the year is 1555!

39
00:05:29,467 --> 00:05:33,333
The Mughal dynasty
had almost ended...

40
00:05:33,600 --> 00:05:36,533
...following Emperor Humayun's
accidental death,

41
00:05:37,533 --> 00:05:43,067
Taking advantage of the situation,
King Hemu seiZed the Delhi throne,

42
00:05:46,733 --> 00:05:50,733
A great battle ensued... in Panipat!

43
00:05:50,800 --> 00:05:56,400
"Pani Pat"

44
00:05:59,333 --> 00:06:01,200
On one side was King Hemu...

45
00:06:01,933 --> 00:06:06,000
...with an army twice the siZe
of the Mughal army,

46
00:06:09,533 --> 00:06:11,200
On the other side...

47
00:06:11,333 --> 00:06:14,867
...was Bairam Khan,
Emperor Humayun's loyal general...

48
00:06:15,533 --> 00:06:20,467
...who was training the 13 year-old
jalaluddin to take on his father's mantle,

49
00:06:20,600 --> 00:06:22,333
You must consolidate Hindustan!

50
00:06:24,000 --> 00:06:27,600
Your courage will lead to victory.

51
00:06:30,067 --> 00:06:34,733
I, Bairam Khan, loyal servant
to the Mughal dynasty...

52
00:06:35,067 --> 00:06:37,333
...remind you once again...

53
00:06:37,467 --> 00:06:40,800
...the future of the Mughals
is in your hands.

54
00:06:42,733 --> 00:06:50,000
Until he breathed his last, your father
Emperor Humayun, had only one dream -

55
00:06:51,200 --> 00:06:53,867
To see the Mughal flag
flying over Hindustan.

56
00:06:54,467 --> 00:06:57,800
God willing, it will be you,
who will fulfill his dream!

57
00:07:06,267 --> 00:07:10,467
Long live Emperor jalaluddin Mohammad!

58
00:07:21,733 --> 00:07:26,200
Prepare to attack!

59
00:07:33,000 --> 00:07:37,333
If we can kill King Hemu,
his army will scatter.

60
00:07:38,200 --> 00:07:42,600
Hemu's eyes alone are eXposed,
unprotected by armour.

61
00:07:43,333 --> 00:07:47,000
Appoint an archer who must
strike him in the eye.

62
00:08:09,200 --> 00:08:13,867
Soldiers and riders! Charge!

63
00:09:28,533 --> 00:09:32,067
Prepare to charge!

64
00:11:34,733 --> 00:11:37,000
Your glorious Majesty!

65
00:11:37,600 --> 00:11:42,600
For the first time, today,
allow your sword to prove its worth.

66
00:11:44,533 --> 00:11:47,067
Behead the traitor...

67
00:11:47,667 --> 00:11:49,667
...and bring glory to the GhaZi name!

68
00:11:50,733 --> 00:11:55,200
He is worse than a dead man, Khan Baba.
How can I strike him?

69
00:11:56,333 --> 00:12:00,000
If you do not, the army will take it amiss...

70
00:12:00,533 --> 00:12:03,000
...and not believe you are a true GhaZi.

71
00:12:03,467 --> 00:12:05,467
Do as I bid!

72
00:12:14,000 --> 00:12:15,200
Soldiers!

73
00:12:29,200 --> 00:12:32,067
My brave Mughal soldiers!

74
00:12:32,267 --> 00:12:34,067
Like his ancestors...

75
00:12:34,533 --> 00:12:41,467
...our Emperor jalaluddin Mohammad too,
is a true GhaZi!

76
00:12:42,667 --> 00:12:46,533
A glorious future to the young Emperor!

77
00:12:54,867 --> 00:13:00,333
This is how Bairam Khan regained
the Delhi throne for the young Emperor,

78
00:13:02,200 --> 00:13:06,800
For the neXt siX years, Bairam Khan
tried consolidating Hindustan...

79
00:13:07,467 --> 00:13:13,200
...by sending emissaries with
proclamations to neighbouring provinces,

80
00:13:16,467 --> 00:13:21,000
This decree has been sent by
Emperor jalaluddin Mohammad!

81
00:13:21,533 --> 00:13:29,467
Align your kingdom,
within a month to the Mughal Empire!

82
00:13:29,867 --> 00:13:36,333
And as a loyal subject,
pay the jaZiya taX and other taXes.

83
00:13:36,933 --> 00:13:40,467
If you reject the Emperor's decree...

84
00:13:40,533 --> 00:13:43,600
...then you will face jalaluddin's wrath!

85
00:13:44,000 --> 00:13:47,867
This disobedience will be deemed a crime.

86
00:13:49,067 --> 00:13:55,267
Offenders and their kingdoms
will be annihilated.

87
00:13:56,667 --> 00:13:59,067
By decree of the Emperor of Hindustan...

88
00:13:59,733 --> 00:14:01,333
...jalaluddin Mohammad!

89
00:14:07,333 --> 00:14:11,000
Tell your Emperor,
he will not have my kingdom!

90
00:14:13,533 --> 00:14:16,600
We, Rajputs, are unused to such orders.

91
00:14:19,600 --> 00:14:21,067
I need some time.

92
00:14:21,733 --> 00:14:23,000
I...

93
00:14:24,600 --> 00:14:25,733
...accept!

94
00:14:26,467 --> 00:14:28,467
But... we too have certain conditions.

95
00:14:30,733 --> 00:14:32,533
I won't give Ajabgarh!

96
00:14:36,333 --> 00:14:37,800
Throw him out!

97
00:14:47,733 --> 00:14:49,000
Prepare to attack!

98
00:15:32,067 --> 00:15:34,467
Have all preparations
been made, Khan Baba?

99
00:15:35,000 --> 00:15:39,200
jalal, the Mughal army awaits your signal.

100
00:15:40,733 --> 00:15:42,933
Was a last chance for peace given?

101
00:15:43,267 --> 00:15:46,067
- Chughtai Khan!
- Your Majesty...

102
00:15:47,667 --> 00:15:51,267
...our peace proclamation
has been returned.

103
00:18:00,667 --> 00:18:04,467
O great and magnificent Emperor,
behead him!

104
00:18:16,333 --> 00:18:17,800
No, Khan Baba.

105
00:18:19,800 --> 00:18:22,467
A king in captivity is at our mercy.

106
00:18:23,467 --> 00:18:25,467
He should be forgiven, not beheaded!

107
00:18:25,600 --> 00:18:27,467
Forgive me, Your Majesty...

108
00:18:27,867 --> 00:18:30,467
...as loyal custodian...

109
00:18:31,000 --> 00:18:33,467
...I will have to preserve the glory
of the Mughal Empire.

110
00:18:37,467 --> 00:18:40,533
Enough, Khan Baba!
No more.

111
00:18:42,733 --> 00:18:43,933
jalal!

112
00:18:45,200 --> 00:18:49,000
Do not forget you are the future
of the Mughal Empire.

113
00:18:49,200 --> 00:18:52,333
I, Bairam Khan, have created you,
O Protector of the World!

114
00:18:52,533 --> 00:18:59,000
I have built the Empire so carefully...
and now you destroy it.

115
00:19:00,067 --> 00:19:03,733
Loyalty can make a man impertinent.

116
00:19:06,600 --> 00:19:10,467
I have seen rebellion
clouding your sight, Khan Baba.

117
00:19:12,667 --> 00:19:15,533
This is the first time,
I have stopped your sword.

118
00:19:16,933 --> 00:19:18,333
Do you know why?

119
00:19:19,200 --> 00:19:24,467
Because from now on...
I will make my own decisions!

120
00:19:26,467 --> 00:19:30,267
From now on, following any battle...

121
00:19:30,733 --> 00:19:33,667
...I want mercy to be shown
to prisoners of war.

122
00:19:35,200 --> 00:19:36,467
Today I declare...

123
00:19:37,067 --> 00:19:41,200
...prisoners of war will not
be enslaved. It is inappropriate.

124
00:19:43,200 --> 00:19:45,467
Yes, I want to rule this land.

125
00:19:47,000 --> 00:19:49,333
But rule it with,
humanity and compassion.

126
00:20:07,000 --> 00:20:08,733
I misunderstood you.

127
00:20:09,600 --> 00:20:11,333
Had I known...

128
00:20:12,067 --> 00:20:17,600
...I wouldn't have had any reservation
in ruling under your sovereignty.

129
00:20:20,200 --> 00:20:23,600
- Chughtai Khan!
- This way, Your Highness!

130
00:20:36,733 --> 00:20:41,200
It is now my desire, that you
unburden yourself of responsibility...

131
00:20:42,200 --> 00:20:46,067
...and devote your life to Allah!
Go on pilgrimage to Mecca.

132
00:21:05,200 --> 00:21:06,333
Your Majesty!

133
00:21:07,467 --> 00:21:09,800
One more province
is now under Mughal rule.

134
00:21:10,533 --> 00:21:12,000
What about Rajputana?

135
00:21:13,467 --> 00:21:16,600
Your Majesty,
their borders are unyielding.

136
00:21:17,333 --> 00:21:22,333
The kings of Rajputana
have rejected our sovereignty outright!

137
00:21:27,000 --> 00:21:28,533
The Rajputs!

138
00:21:31,200 --> 00:21:35,467
Devotees of the sword,
the bravest of the brave!

139
00:22:31,467 --> 00:22:33,000
Your Highness!

140
00:22:41,333 --> 00:22:43,867
What's the reason for this interruption.

141
00:22:43,933 --> 00:22:47,200
Forgive me. The Queen
is asking for the Princess.

142
00:22:48,333 --> 00:22:50,533
Tell the Queen mother,
I'll join her shortly.

143
00:22:51,000 --> 00:22:52,400
As you wish.

144
00:22:56,000 --> 00:22:57,467
jodhaa, this isn't fair!

145
00:22:58,000 --> 00:23:01,467
I was about to win when
the attendant distracted me.

146
00:23:02,267 --> 00:23:05,733
Victory is victory, brother.
I have defeated you!

147
00:23:13,333 --> 00:23:15,000
Brother Sujamal, remember -

148
00:23:15,067 --> 00:23:18,267
a moment's distraction
can change the duel's outcome.

149
00:23:18,733 --> 00:23:23,000
A slight distraction
can bring defeat... or death!

150
00:23:24,533 --> 00:23:27,933
- It is you who taught me that!
- Yes, I know.

151
00:23:28,733 --> 00:23:32,533
Now the student teaches the teacher.

152
00:23:33,533 --> 00:23:35,733
Not teaching, only reminding.

153
00:23:36,733 --> 00:23:40,200
Let me tell you.
Your skills are impressive.

154
00:23:40,800 --> 00:23:45,467
A good student absorbs knowledge
swiftly and well.

155
00:23:46,467 --> 00:23:48,267
Like you, jodhaa!

156
00:23:48,867 --> 00:23:55,533
Really? So I am a good student.
Thanks to a wise teacher like you.

157
00:23:56,267 --> 00:23:59,467
- Your new teacher is wiser.
- A new teacher? Who is that?

158
00:23:59,733 --> 00:24:00,933
The Queen.

159
00:24:01,533 --> 00:24:07,533
Your mother will teach you,
what women must know.

160
00:24:08,533 --> 00:24:10,000
You will soon be carried away
in a palanquin.

161
00:24:11,533 --> 00:24:13,200
But I have a condition!

162
00:24:13,733 --> 00:24:17,200
I will not marry, till father
appoints you the Crown Prince!

163
00:24:17,333 --> 00:24:19,200
- But...
- My last word!

164
00:24:19,733 --> 00:24:22,800
jodhaa, you must not make
unreasonable demands.

165
00:24:23,600 --> 00:24:27,600
But it's true!
I have heard father praise your skills.

166
00:24:28,200 --> 00:24:32,600
He speaks of your bravery.
And the many tournaments you have won...

167
00:24:33,067 --> 00:24:35,333
...you are proficient in warfare
deserving to be crowned.

168
00:24:35,733 --> 00:24:39,267
Now there's nothing
to be worried about. Am I right?

169
00:24:45,200 --> 00:24:48,733
Let the prayer begin -
In the name of Lord Surya...

170
00:25:18,333 --> 00:25:20,933
On this auspicious day of Dassera...

171
00:25:21,200 --> 00:25:23,800
...it is time for
important announcements!

172
00:25:26,800 --> 00:25:29,333
My first announcement is:

173
00:25:29,600 --> 00:25:34,800
The reins of Amer will be
in Bhagwan Das's hands.

174
00:25:37,533 --> 00:25:39,000
The second:

175
00:25:40,933 --> 00:25:46,067
Sujamal... will be subordinate
to Bhagwan Das.

176
00:25:52,733 --> 00:25:58,267
And now for the news,
you've long awaited.

177
00:26:00,533 --> 00:26:05,333
Within the year, on an auspicious day,
with Goddess jamvai Mata's blessings...

178
00:26:06,000 --> 00:26:09,933
...Princess jodhaa
and Prince Ratan Singh...

179
00:26:10,200 --> 00:26:13,200
...will be joined in holy matrimony!

180
00:26:15,267 --> 00:26:17,533
Congratulations!

181
00:26:18,933 --> 00:26:20,867
Feign some shyness!

182
00:26:22,867 --> 00:26:24,333
A fruitful union!

183
00:26:32,333 --> 00:26:35,467
Where are you going?
They must be looking for you.

184
00:26:37,600 --> 00:26:39,467
Give me your veil.

185
00:26:45,533 --> 00:26:48,933
- Go and take my place discreetly.
- Yes.

186
00:26:53,333 --> 00:26:57,000
Brother, it grieved me to hear...

187
00:26:58,200 --> 00:27:01,467
...perhaps... father was helpless!

188
00:27:01,867 --> 00:27:03,000
Helpless?

189
00:27:04,067 --> 00:27:06,267
More like selfish and greedy.

190
00:27:06,867 --> 00:27:08,467
I am not hungry for power.

191
00:27:09,000 --> 00:27:11,067
I never eyed a thing that isn't mine.

192
00:27:11,600 --> 00:27:14,733
I don't mind sharing the kingdom
with Bhagwan Das and Maan Singh.

193
00:27:15,733 --> 00:27:21,000
All I want is, my self-respect and
honour. And what is rightfully mine.

194
00:27:22,200 --> 00:27:24,067
And if I am denied this...

195
00:27:27,067 --> 00:27:31,733
...then, remember jodhaa,
the setting sun will rise again!

196
00:27:43,467 --> 00:27:44,533
Brother!

197
00:28:12,067 --> 00:28:15,567
I will speak to the Emperor
at an opportune moment...

198
00:28:16,767 --> 00:28:20,567
...and request him to ask
King Bharmal...

199
00:28:21,467 --> 00:28:24,467
...to give you a share
of the Amer throne.

200
00:28:28,567 --> 00:28:31,467
I will be indebted to you,
Sharifuddin Hussain!

201
00:28:33,667 --> 00:28:35,500
What will I get in return?

202
00:28:36,500 --> 00:28:37,567
What do you want?

203
00:28:39,167 --> 00:28:40,500
To invade Delhi!

204
00:28:43,967 --> 00:28:45,767
Invade... Delhi?

205
00:28:46,500 --> 00:28:49,967
Once you have your share of Amer,
you will have to help me...

206
00:28:52,033 --> 00:28:53,567
...to invade Delhi.

207
00:28:54,167 --> 00:28:57,500
But are you not
the Emperor's brother-in-law?

208
00:28:58,567 --> 00:29:03,233
Yes, I did marry Bakshi Banu Begum,
jalaluddin's sister.

209
00:29:04,833 --> 00:29:09,500
Due to that alliance, I was appointed,
the Governor of Ajmer, Nagor and Mewat.

210
00:29:10,833 --> 00:29:13,033
Let me tell you something Sujamal.

211
00:29:14,633 --> 00:29:20,500
Water and ambition have one thing
in common - they are ever-swelling.

212
00:29:23,300 --> 00:29:26,033
Now I want all of Hindustan!

213
00:29:31,300 --> 00:29:34,233
Very well. I will help you.

214
00:29:36,433 --> 00:29:39,167
But no blood must be shed
in my accession.

215
00:29:40,033 --> 00:29:42,967
What we dreaded has happened!

216
00:29:43,767 --> 00:29:49,433
Sujamal has asked Sharifuddin
for help to anneX my throne.

217
00:29:51,967 --> 00:29:55,167
If a war is waged,
our kingdom will be ruined.

218
00:29:56,300 --> 00:29:59,767
Thousands of women will be widowed.
Children orphaned.

219
00:30:00,900 --> 00:30:03,700
The very thought makes me tremble.

220
00:30:04,700 --> 00:30:09,967
It does not make any sense to let
innocent people get slaughtered.

221
00:30:14,033 --> 00:30:16,167
Chandrabhanji...

222
00:30:17,433 --> 00:30:20,500
...wouldn't it be wise to make peace
with the Mughals...

223
00:30:20,700 --> 00:30:25,433
...and offer jalaluddin
a hand of friendship?

224
00:30:29,300 --> 00:30:33,300
- Do that and be branded a traitor!
- An alliance with the Mughals?

225
00:30:33,500 --> 00:30:35,633
No greater eXample of treason.

226
00:30:35,900 --> 00:30:37,700
You'll surely be regarded a traitor.

227
00:30:38,633 --> 00:30:43,500
It pains me too.
But let me tell you...

228
00:30:44,700 --> 00:30:49,700
...I will be saving my people from
defeat, death and disaster...

229
00:30:50,833 --> 00:30:53,967
...by accepting the Mughal treaty!

230
00:30:55,167 --> 00:30:57,033
Very well, King Bharmal...

231
00:30:57,900 --> 00:31:01,433
...Iet me warn you and
the people of Amer...

232
00:31:01,567 --> 00:31:03,700
...because of your decision...

233
00:31:03,900 --> 00:31:08,167
...no alliances will take place
between our families...

234
00:31:08,300 --> 00:31:12,767
...for present and future generations!
- Not only Ajabgarh!

235
00:31:16,700 --> 00:31:21,567
All of Rajputana will cut ties with you!

236
00:31:31,700 --> 00:31:34,233
Rajaji, welcome to Sanganer!

237
00:31:34,767 --> 00:31:37,833
His Majesty has seen
Chandrabhanji's message.

238
00:31:38,500 --> 00:31:41,233
He will meet you here,
in the elephant arena.

239
00:31:52,833 --> 00:31:56,300
- Where is His Majesty?
- His Majesty? Right there.

240
00:32:02,500 --> 00:32:07,167
Taming wild elephants and horses
is the Emperor's favourite pastime.

241
00:33:28,033 --> 00:33:30,300
This is no longer a sport!

242
00:34:41,033 --> 00:34:44,033
Your Majesty,
King Bharmal of Amer...

243
00:34:44,167 --> 00:34:49,167
...Head of the Kachhaawaas -
a great Rajput dynasty, awaits you.

244
00:34:49,700 --> 00:34:50,767
Welcome!

245
00:34:51,767 --> 00:34:53,300
Greetings, Your Majesty!

246
00:34:55,167 --> 00:35:00,300
We praise your courage.
A truly amaZing feat!

247
00:35:01,233 --> 00:35:04,033
I invite you to my royal tent.

248
00:35:04,567 --> 00:35:06,767
I will be pleased
to welcome you there, Rajaji.

249
00:35:07,033 --> 00:35:08,967
As you wish!

250
00:35:10,433 --> 00:35:13,433
On your guard!

251
00:35:13,967 --> 00:35:16,300
The Crown of the Mughals...

252
00:35:16,567 --> 00:35:19,300
...the Emperor of Hindustan...

253
00:35:19,700 --> 00:35:22,433
...jalaluddin Mohammad approaches!

254
00:35:28,500 --> 00:35:33,433
Welcome. I am honoured
you have traveled so far to see me.

255
00:35:34,167 --> 00:35:35,633
May I know the purpose of this visit?

256
00:35:36,033 --> 00:35:42,500
I wish to include the kingdom of Amer
under Mughal sovereignty.

257
00:35:44,033 --> 00:35:49,033
I am pleased and proud to hear
you are entrusting Amer to us.

258
00:35:50,300 --> 00:35:54,700
I wish to discuss... one more matter...

259
00:35:55,633 --> 00:35:56,633
Please go ahead.

260
00:35:57,500 --> 00:35:58,700
In private...

261
00:36:02,967 --> 00:36:04,567
Disperse!

262
00:36:16,767 --> 00:36:17,833
Pray speak.

263
00:36:20,433 --> 00:36:25,700
You must accept the hand...
of my daughter, Princess jodhaa!

264
00:36:27,167 --> 00:36:32,967
And this will be a marriage of
alliance between the Mughals and Amer.

265
00:36:42,700 --> 00:36:47,567
I can understand...
the reason behind your silence...

266
00:36:48,167 --> 00:36:50,700
- Probably...
- Don't misunderstand.

267
00:36:51,967 --> 00:36:55,500
I appreciate your courage
in speaking your mind.

268
00:36:57,633 --> 00:37:00,900
I am honoured by your proposal.
And I thank you for it.

269
00:37:01,767 --> 00:37:03,500
Let me give it some thought.

270
00:37:04,033 --> 00:37:07,167
Only after visiting
the shrine of Saint Moinuddin Chisti...

271
00:37:07,433 --> 00:37:09,433
...will I send you my response.

272
00:37:10,433 --> 00:37:12,700
As it befits you!

273
00:37:20,300 --> 00:37:22,900
Help me, Khwaja! Help me.

274
00:37:23,300 --> 00:37:26,500
I have come to Your sacred shrine
with a dream -

275
00:37:27,500 --> 00:37:32,700
The dream of a consolidated Hindustan
under the Mughal sky.

276
00:37:35,433 --> 00:37:39,967
Pray to Allah to help me
fulfill this dream, O Saint!

277
00:37:41,700 --> 00:37:43,167
Ameen!

278
00:37:53,500 --> 00:37:55,900
May peace be upon you!

279
00:37:56,033 --> 00:37:59,300
- Sharifuddin, all well?
- Yes, Your Majesty!

280
00:37:59,700 --> 00:38:00,833
Yes, Khan Baba?

281
00:38:01,033 --> 00:38:06,033
jalal, there was almost
a riot on my way to Ajmer...

282
00:38:06,500 --> 00:38:08,433
...when some Hindu Rajputs...

283
00:38:08,833 --> 00:38:12,033
...stopped Muslim pilgrims
from coming to this shrine.

284
00:38:12,633 --> 00:38:14,700
Due to that, the unrest is spreading.

285
00:38:15,433 --> 00:38:20,567
Such religious riots,
can cause disaster some day.

286
00:38:21,567 --> 00:38:23,900
Will more security
on the Ajmer route help?

287
00:38:24,033 --> 00:38:26,767
Your Majesty, orders will be issued!

288
00:38:26,967 --> 00:38:30,167
Many more places
need surveillance, Sharifuddin.

289
00:38:30,633 --> 00:38:35,433
Apart from Ajmer, there is...
Iooting and plundering on the route...

290
00:38:35,700 --> 00:38:38,300
...Ieading to the Gujarat ports.

291
00:38:38,767 --> 00:38:41,033
That is causing problems
for the Haj pilgrims.

292
00:38:41,500 --> 00:38:43,767
Whom does the Ajmer province fall under?

293
00:38:43,967 --> 00:38:46,167
King Bharmal of Amer.

294
00:38:51,967 --> 00:38:57,967
Khan Baba! Kindly get my message
sent to King Bharmal.

295
00:38:59,167 --> 00:39:03,767
I accept his proposal of a
marriage of alliance with his daughter.

296
00:39:05,167 --> 00:39:06,700
And especially mention -

297
00:39:08,167 --> 00:39:10,633
To ensure peace and unity
in the province...

298
00:39:11,033 --> 00:39:14,433
...I will be pleased
to accept this marriage!

299
00:39:14,900 --> 00:39:20,900
But consider that she is a Rajput.
A Hindu. How is this marriage possible?

300
00:39:21,433 --> 00:39:23,500
Kindly reconsider your decision.

301
00:39:23,900 --> 00:39:28,033
Sharifuddin, I have
thought it over carefully.

302
00:39:29,167 --> 00:39:34,033
It was the respected Bairam Khan Baba...

303
00:39:35,433 --> 00:39:40,967
...who held the reins of
the Mughal rule in my name for years.

304
00:39:42,767 --> 00:39:44,300
For all these years...

305
00:39:45,033 --> 00:39:47,833
I have often wondered...

306
00:39:48,033 --> 00:39:52,500
...why our forefathers
failed to take over all of Hindustan.

307
00:39:54,433 --> 00:39:59,700
Until now I have been in a quandary,
how to make this dream come true.

308
00:40:01,500 --> 00:40:06,167
The goal was clear,
but the path was unknown!

309
00:40:09,633 --> 00:40:14,900
A marriage of alliance. A new bond.
A divine signal from Allah.

310
00:40:15,967 --> 00:40:19,967
I thank you, Almighty Allah,
for showing me the way forward.

311
00:40:21,833 --> 00:40:25,500
Khan Baba,
convey my message of acceptance.

312
00:40:26,500 --> 00:40:28,500
But father, he is a Mughal!

313
00:40:33,500 --> 00:40:36,633
Earlier too, I did not have a choice...

314
00:40:38,033 --> 00:40:42,900
...when I was betrothed to
Prince Ratan Singh of Ajabgarh.

315
00:40:44,700 --> 00:40:49,967
I convinced my heart to accept him.

316
00:40:52,433 --> 00:40:57,167
But now I am being married to a man...

317
00:40:58,567 --> 00:41:01,700
...who belongs to a different religion.

318
00:41:02,300 --> 00:41:07,033
jodhaa, as your father, I understand what
you're going through.

319
00:41:07,700 --> 00:41:10,767
Your heart had set out
to marry Prince Ratan Singh.

320
00:41:11,433 --> 00:41:15,567
But it is them
who have broken the alliance!

321
00:41:17,700 --> 00:41:23,500
It pains me to ask.
If not for your father...

322
00:41:25,700 --> 00:41:27,300
...then for the sake of your people...

323
00:41:28,167 --> 00:41:30,233
...for the province of Amer...

324
00:41:31,500 --> 00:41:34,567
...you will have to sacrifice
your happiness.

325
00:41:54,500 --> 00:41:58,033
I hear you have a message from Agra.
Is brother set to marry?

326
00:41:59,833 --> 00:42:02,967
I wonder why
it has been decided so quickly.

327
00:42:04,500 --> 00:42:06,433
Mother is away on a provincial tour.

328
00:42:06,833 --> 00:42:12,033
- We must go at once. A lot needs...
- Control your emotions, Begum!

329
00:42:13,567 --> 00:42:16,167
Do you have any idea who he is marrying?

330
00:42:17,300 --> 00:42:19,300
The Princess of Amer.

331
00:42:20,900 --> 00:42:22,300
A Hindu!

332
00:42:23,567 --> 00:42:28,633
Listen carefully!
I will not attend this impure ceremony.

333
00:42:30,300 --> 00:42:31,833
And neither will you!

334
00:42:32,900 --> 00:42:34,033
Please listen...

335
00:42:42,500 --> 00:42:46,833
Brother, forgive me.

336
00:42:51,167 --> 00:42:55,233
Dear brother, I need your help,
Please rescue me, Yours, jodhaa,

337
00:42:56,633 --> 00:43:00,500
No. How can I send
this letter to Sujamal?

338
00:43:01,567 --> 00:43:05,633
- When I know that he's suffering.
- Forgive me, jodhaa.

339
00:43:05,767 --> 00:43:09,233
What if Prince Ratan Singh
reconsiders marrying you?

340
00:43:09,433 --> 00:43:14,167
If you just tell him you are
opposed to this marriage. Then...

341
00:43:14,300 --> 00:43:17,567
No, Madhavi. In doing that,
I'll be hurting father.

342
00:43:18,300 --> 00:43:23,167
He is convinced this alliance
will safeguard our kingdom.

343
00:43:23,900 --> 00:43:25,767
Disperse!

344
00:43:31,167 --> 00:43:32,767
There is a way out.

345
00:43:38,167 --> 00:43:42,700
Why not send a companion
in your place to marry him?

346
00:43:43,833 --> 00:43:45,833
He has never seen you.

347
00:43:50,233 --> 00:43:53,900
No, mother. If the Mughal Emperor
discovers the truth...

348
00:43:54,300 --> 00:43:57,700
...Amer will have to face his wrath.

349
00:43:59,433 --> 00:44:01,500
They will definitely get to know.

350
00:44:06,700 --> 00:44:08,167
Then, my dear...

351
00:44:14,300 --> 00:44:16,300
...keep this vial of poison...

352
00:44:19,167 --> 00:44:24,567
...drinking poison is better than
losing your honour!

353
00:44:41,900 --> 00:44:46,967
O enchanter of the heart

354
00:44:47,700 --> 00:44:53,167
O enchanter of the heart

355
00:44:53,567 --> 00:44:55,500
My beloved Krishna, heed me

356
00:44:55,767 --> 00:44:59,167
Lord, why me?

357
00:44:59,967 --> 00:45:04,300
How will I find peace without You?

358
00:45:05,167 --> 00:45:10,233
Night and day I pine for You

359
00:45:13,967 --> 00:45:19,833
Abandon Your sacred
cities of Kashi and Mathura

360
00:45:25,833 --> 00:45:31,167
Come and dwell in my eyes

361
00:45:31,700 --> 00:45:35,167
How will I find peace without You?

362
00:45:35,500 --> 00:45:41,300
My beloved Krishna,
night and day I pine for You

363
00:46:58,167 --> 00:47:01,433
- Yes, Princess?
- I have come to a decision.

364
00:47:02,033 --> 00:47:06,500
I wish to meet the Emperor
before I consent to marry.

365
00:47:07,233 --> 00:47:09,433
I have certain conditions.

366
00:47:13,167 --> 00:47:15,033
And for that, she has requested...

367
00:47:15,167 --> 00:47:20,167
...Your Majesty's presence
in her royal tent.

368
00:47:37,500 --> 00:47:39,300
What are these conditions?

369
00:47:39,967 --> 00:47:41,700
They are unknown to me!

370
00:47:42,900 --> 00:47:46,833
I am sorry, she has refused to tell me.

371
00:48:20,300 --> 00:48:22,167
I welcome you...

372
00:48:23,300 --> 00:48:27,300
...I cannot find the words
to eXpress my appreciation...

373
00:48:27,633 --> 00:48:30,433
...that you agreed
to come and hear me out.

374
00:48:31,633 --> 00:48:34,233
I have two conditions -

375
00:48:34,500 --> 00:48:37,967
Only if these are met,
will I marry you.

376
00:48:41,167 --> 00:48:42,567
And what are they?

377
00:48:45,900 --> 00:48:47,700
My first condition -

378
00:48:47,967 --> 00:48:51,167
I will be allowed
to keep my religion, my faith...

379
00:48:51,633 --> 00:48:54,967
...follow my customs and traditions...

380
00:48:55,700 --> 00:48:59,967
...and under no circumstances,
will I be coerced into conversion!

381
00:49:05,033 --> 00:49:06,433
Do you accept?

382
00:49:08,967 --> 00:49:09,833
And?

383
00:49:14,567 --> 00:49:17,900
I will be allowed to bring
an idol of my God with me...

384
00:49:18,500 --> 00:49:23,833
...and for Him, a temple
will be built in my chamber!

385
00:49:27,700 --> 00:49:30,500
These are my two conditions.

386
00:49:51,700 --> 00:49:56,033
King Bharmal's daughter
has put two conditions before me.

387
00:49:57,433 --> 00:49:59,167
Only if I meet them...

388
00:50:02,300 --> 00:50:04,767
...will she consent to marry me.

389
00:50:07,233 --> 00:50:08,567
Her first condition:

390
00:50:10,167 --> 00:50:15,967
She would like to keep
her religion and traditions.

391
00:50:18,833 --> 00:50:20,300
And the second:

392
00:50:21,767 --> 00:50:29,500
A temple should be built in her palace
inside the Mughal fort.

393
00:50:42,633 --> 00:50:48,233
This the first time I have eXperienced
the legendary Rajput pride and dignity.

394
00:50:50,967 --> 00:50:56,833
I salute the Princess of Amer's
fearless courage and candour!

395
00:50:59,167 --> 00:51:02,900
Let me tell her that l, too...

396
00:51:03,567 --> 00:51:07,833
...am born on the same soil as her.

397
00:51:09,967 --> 00:51:13,833
And l, too, have
the same courage and candour!

398
00:51:16,033 --> 00:51:19,900
I have decided that the alliance
with Princess jodhaa of Amer...

399
00:51:23,500 --> 00:51:25,967
...is acceptable to me!

400
00:51:28,500 --> 00:51:33,767
Allah willing, her demands
will be met to her satisfaction.

401
00:53:18,567 --> 00:53:22,033
Congratulations!

402
00:53:22,300 --> 00:53:23,900
Your Majesty, congratulations!

403
00:53:23,967 --> 00:53:31,167
Your marriage has given the pilgrims
of Ajmer Sharif new reason to rejoice.

404
00:53:31,433 --> 00:53:38,567
A group of Sufis would like to perform
in honour of Khwaja Gharib NawaaZ.

405
00:53:42,300 --> 00:53:47,167
Khwajaji, O Saint

406
00:53:51,233 --> 00:53:56,500
Khwajaji! O Master

407
00:54:03,300 --> 00:54:09,500
O Benevolent Heeder of the poor

408
00:54:28,433 --> 00:54:32,767
O Moinuddin

409
00:55:06,300 --> 00:55:13,567
O my beloved Khwaja!
Abide in my heart

410
00:55:14,033 --> 00:55:21,167
O King of Kings, O beloved of Ali!

411
00:55:37,967 --> 00:55:44,100
O my beloved Khwaja!
Abide in my heart

412
00:55:53,500 --> 00:56:01,233
You restore the destiny of the helpless

413
00:56:18,033 --> 00:56:25,567
O Saint, I have seen
divine light in Your court

414
00:56:37,700 --> 00:56:45,300
O Saint, men of God
lower their heads in Your court

415
00:56:45,567 --> 00:56:53,367
You are the Peer of the realm of Hindal
You are the Pinnacle

416
00:56:54,567 --> 00:56:58,567
In yearning for You,
beloved Khwajaji...

417
00:56:58,700 --> 00:57:01,833
...we have found the Prophet,
the Chosen One

418
00:57:46,300 --> 00:57:50,167
My master has lead me to You

419
00:58:02,367 --> 00:58:09,967
My master has led me to You
I have found refuge in You

420
00:58:18,033 --> 00:58:21,833
All my troubles have ended

421
00:58:21,833 --> 00:58:25,833
Now I am one with You

422
00:58:25,967 --> 00:58:33,700
No matter how proud I am to be
one with You, it is but little

423
00:58:34,433 --> 00:58:41,233
I shall never leave the place
where Your feet rest

424
01:02:05,033 --> 01:02:07,433
What is the reason
for this sternness?

425
01:02:11,167 --> 01:02:13,100
Does this marriage displease you?

426
01:02:26,300 --> 01:02:29,100
Islam gives women equal rights
to dissolve a marriage.

427
01:02:31,767 --> 01:02:35,033
If you do not want this marriage...

428
01:02:35,700 --> 01:02:39,500
...choose the path of the 'khulla' and
absolve yourself from this marriage.

429
01:02:39,833 --> 01:02:41,300
It is your right!

430
01:02:42,300 --> 01:02:45,100
You can break this bond and be free.

431
01:02:46,767 --> 01:02:49,033
Your customs may permit 'khulla',

432
01:02:50,167 --> 01:02:53,967
But for us,
marriage binds us for seven lifetimes.

433
01:02:55,500 --> 01:03:00,300
I am grateful to you,
for accepting my demands.

434
01:03:02,833 --> 01:03:07,500
I don't know,
why my mind is filled with doubt.

435
01:03:10,100 --> 01:03:14,500
My mind hasn't made
peace with this marriage.

436
01:03:17,500 --> 01:03:23,567
Perhaps, it is because our religion
and cultures are so different.

437
01:03:27,967 --> 01:03:30,167
I did give my consent
to this marriage...

438
01:03:31,033 --> 01:03:38,967
...yet, my heart does not
allow me to be close to you!

439
01:03:47,033 --> 01:03:49,367
I respect you.

440
01:03:50,700 --> 01:03:53,100
I value your feelings.

441
01:03:55,700 --> 01:03:58,300
I will not force myself on you.

442
01:04:08,967 --> 01:04:14,967
I will be close to you when,
God willing, your heart permits.

443
01:04:19,500 --> 01:04:21,567
May Allah give you peace!

444
01:04:56,500 --> 01:04:57,767
Where's the Emperor?

445
01:04:57,967 --> 01:05:00,500
He is leaving for Malwa
on urgent business.

446
01:05:15,967 --> 01:05:18,033
Is everything alright, jodhaa?

447
01:05:23,700 --> 01:05:25,033
Yes.

448
01:06:20,233 --> 01:06:25,433
The Empress Hamida Banu Begum,
mother of the Emperor!

449
01:06:26,100 --> 01:06:29,100
Welcome, my dear.

450
01:06:47,567 --> 01:06:52,433
May Allah protect you from the evil eye
and keep you well and happy!

451
01:06:54,767 --> 01:06:58,100
Ameen! So be it!

452
01:07:00,367 --> 01:07:04,167
Let me introduce you.
This is Maham Anga...

453
01:07:05,767 --> 01:07:10,500
...jalaluddin's wet nurse.
She is like a mother to him.

454
01:07:11,100 --> 01:07:13,833
She is also a Minister
in the Mughal Court.

455
01:07:26,167 --> 01:07:30,167
Remember one thing,
Maham Anga has special status.

456
01:07:30,567 --> 01:07:32,967
jalal regards her above all the others.

457
01:07:33,500 --> 01:07:37,833
More than me.
I have been away most of the time.

458
01:07:38,967 --> 01:07:45,833
She nurtured jalal
during my 15-year absence.

459
01:07:46,967 --> 01:07:53,300
He may ignore my word,
but never hers.

460
01:07:55,500 --> 01:07:58,567
Do not be apprehensive, Princess.

461
01:07:59,833 --> 01:08:01,767
This is your home!

462
01:08:03,700 --> 01:08:06,767
Salima, escort the Princess
to her royal chamber.

463
01:08:06,967 --> 01:08:08,167
Yes, Your Majesty.

464
01:08:10,500 --> 01:08:12,967
Wait! A ritual is yet to be done.

465
01:08:13,500 --> 01:08:36,500
Rajput Folk Song about a New Bride

466
01:08:39,833 --> 01:08:43,700
Walk this way, Empress,
with your pretty coloured feet.

467
01:08:52,700 --> 01:09:00,433
The wind is blowing in the wrong
direction. Watch her every step!

468
01:09:02,567 --> 01:09:07,033
Come, my Empress!
The women's palaces, the royal harem!

469
01:09:10,700 --> 01:09:14,500
This is your royal chamber.
It has five sections -

470
01:09:14,967 --> 01:09:17,567
The first is for meetings,
the Goshay Mulaakaat!

471
01:09:17,833 --> 01:09:21,967
Meet Shaak and Shurukh.
They learn quickly...

472
01:09:22,500 --> 01:09:25,367
...and repeat every word they hear.

473
01:09:28,567 --> 01:09:32,700
This is your sleeping chamber,
the Khwabgah...

474
01:09:41,567 --> 01:09:44,033
...your changing room,
the Toshak Khana...

475
01:09:46,567 --> 01:09:52,300
...your gallery, the jharokha
and your prayer room, the Tasbih Khana!

476
01:09:52,833 --> 01:09:55,833
But... you won't need the Tasbih Khana.

477
01:09:56,233 --> 01:10:01,700
I will, Ni'mat.
I will have my Krishna temple here.

478
01:10:01,700 --> 01:10:06,967
So now we'll hear Hindu devotional
songs echoing in the Mughal fort. Right?

479
01:10:07,100 --> 01:10:09,033
Ni'mat!

480
01:10:10,767 --> 01:10:16,967
We did hear of your conditions.
You merit all praise, Empress!

481
01:10:17,033 --> 01:10:23,433
Rest assured, these are the Mughals.
A magnificent temple will be built.

482
01:10:24,700 --> 01:10:29,033
Not magnificent.
A small temple is what I desire.

483
01:10:29,500 --> 01:10:32,367
Kindly pass on this message
to the Emperor.

484
01:10:32,700 --> 01:10:34,567
Yes, Empress!

485
01:11:00,567 --> 01:11:02,833
Attention! Silence!

486
01:11:04,033 --> 01:11:07,967
Let everyone know!
Fold your hands!

487
01:11:08,500 --> 01:11:15,500
Lower your eyes! Crown of the Mughals!
Lord of his subjects!

488
01:11:15,833 --> 01:11:22,567
Heir of Timor! jewel of Babur!
Son of Humayun!

489
01:11:22,967 --> 01:11:27,167
Merciful Protector!
Renowned in the Universe!

490
01:11:27,300 --> 01:11:29,833
The Emperor of Hindustan!

491
01:11:30,433 --> 01:11:37,567
jalaluddin Mohammad,
graces this court with his presence!

492
01:11:46,167 --> 01:11:50,500
Long live
Emperor jalaluddin Mohammad!

493
01:11:55,367 --> 01:11:57,833
Finance Minister, Todarmalji...

494
01:12:01,300 --> 01:12:07,700
Your Majesty, war raises
taXes and causes inflation...

495
01:12:08,300 --> 01:12:14,500
...hitting the common man the hardest.
War destroys the economy!

496
01:12:14,833 --> 01:12:16,767
You are so right, Todarmalji!

497
01:12:17,500 --> 01:12:19,833
This needs special attention.

498
01:12:21,233 --> 01:12:24,033
We'll discuss it in the Diwan-E-Khas!
(Private Audience Hall)

499
01:12:25,300 --> 01:12:26,100
Let's proceed.

500
01:12:26,833 --> 01:12:30,300
Your Majesty, we've got news
that your brother-in-law...

501
01:12:30,967 --> 01:12:35,567
...Sharifuddin Hussain, has taken over
the governance of Ajmer.

502
01:12:37,033 --> 01:12:39,967
And he did this
because he is displeased...

503
01:12:40,367 --> 01:12:43,300
...with your marriage
to the Rajput Princess.

504
01:12:43,500 --> 01:12:49,700
Silence, Adham Khan! We will
speak of family quarrels in private.

505
01:12:50,033 --> 01:12:54,367
No, Khan Baba.
Let Adham Khan continue...

506
01:12:55,700 --> 01:12:57,100
Forgive me, Your Majesty!

507
01:12:57,967 --> 01:13:02,833
Sharifuddin doubts your abilities
and intelligence as Emperor.

508
01:13:03,967 --> 01:13:05,500
He even dared to say...

509
01:13:06,300 --> 01:13:10,700
because of this marriage you will
cause the ruin of the Mughal dynasty.

510
01:13:11,967 --> 01:13:17,100
He has crossed all boundaries
of respect by spreading this to all.

511
01:13:18,967 --> 01:13:20,567
Sharifuddin!

512
01:13:21,967 --> 01:13:23,233
Your Majesty...

513
01:13:24,967 --> 01:13:29,967
...ignore him.
A frog can only leap so high!

514
01:13:31,700 --> 01:13:37,167
But Sharifuddin has a point,
Madam Maham Anga.

515
01:13:40,433 --> 01:13:41,567
Your Majesty...

516
01:13:42,567 --> 01:13:46,967
...was this the only way
to consolidate the Empire?

517
01:13:48,167 --> 01:13:50,167
Pardon my impertinence...

518
01:13:50,967 --> 01:13:54,967
...but may I suggest that your heart
is taking control of your mind.

519
01:13:57,300 --> 01:14:00,167
What compelled you to marry a Hindu?

520
01:14:00,700 --> 01:14:05,100
It was an administrative decision, Head
of the Ullemas. Of benefit to everyone.

521
01:14:06,033 --> 01:14:08,367
Measures taken
for the country's welfare...

522
01:14:08,700 --> 01:14:10,567
...shouldn't be construed
as anti-religious.

523
01:14:11,167 --> 01:14:15,433
You are right.
But our sore point is...

524
01:14:15,967 --> 01:14:18,433
...why was a temple built in the fort?

525
01:14:18,700 --> 01:14:20,567
It is a blow to our hearts!

526
01:14:21,833 --> 01:14:25,233
Shaikh Mubarak Sahib...
Saadir Adaasi Sahib!

527
01:14:26,300 --> 01:14:29,567
Circumstances compelled me
to do what I did.

528
01:14:31,233 --> 01:14:35,033
The well being of the kingdom
is utmost in my mind!

529
01:14:37,833 --> 01:14:42,367
Very well, what do you eXpect
from me, respected Sirs?

530
01:14:43,167 --> 01:14:45,500
Forgive me for saying this,
Your Majesty...

531
01:14:47,167 --> 01:14:52,700
...the Empress must be kept out
of all the common areas in the fort.

532
01:14:55,233 --> 01:14:58,833
And no lslamic tradition should be
changed on account of her.

533
01:15:04,500 --> 01:15:09,833
O enchanter of the heart

534
01:15:10,233 --> 01:15:16,100
My beloved Krishna, heed me

535
01:15:16,233 --> 01:15:21,100
How will I find peace without You?

536
01:15:21,967 --> 01:15:26,833
Night and day I pine for You

537
01:15:30,967 --> 01:15:36,567
Abandon Your sacred
cities of Kashi and Mathura

538
01:15:42,367 --> 01:15:47,700
Come and dwell in my eyes

539
01:15:48,300 --> 01:15:51,700
How will I find peace without You?

540
01:15:51,967 --> 01:15:58,033
My beloved Krishna,
night and day I pine for You

541
01:16:25,700 --> 01:16:26,967
Disperse!

542
01:16:28,700 --> 01:16:33,700
The Royal Court of Public Proceedings
is adjourned for the day!

543
01:17:16,100 --> 01:17:21,833
O Divine dancer who resides
in Gokul in Vrindavan

544
01:17:21,967 --> 01:17:27,300
Radha, your handmaiden,
yearns for the sight of You

545
01:17:30,833 --> 01:17:36,500
O beautiful dusky son of Nanda,
beloved Krishna

546
01:17:36,967 --> 01:17:41,700
O forest-dweller, beauty is Your form

547
01:17:42,233 --> 01:17:47,033
I have surrendered
body and soul to You

548
01:17:54,300 --> 01:18:17,233
O enchanter of the heart!
O enchanter of the heart!

549
01:19:18,967 --> 01:19:20,300
Vermilion.

550
01:20:24,500 --> 01:20:29,967
I belong to You,
my life belongs to You

551
01:20:32,967 --> 01:20:40,500
I see only You
In every reflection

552
01:20:43,500 --> 01:20:50,367
I shall become Your flute
And belong to Your lips alone

553
01:20:52,167 --> 01:21:02,500
My heart is flooded with dreams

554
01:21:15,233 --> 01:21:20,700
Why was Shamsuddin Atka Khan
appointed Prime Minister, and not me?

555
01:21:21,700 --> 01:21:23,433
It is now clear to me.

556
01:21:24,300 --> 01:21:27,767
You consider
Shamsuddin Atka Khan as a father...

557
01:21:28,167 --> 01:21:30,700
...and hence you made him
the Prime Minister.

558
01:21:31,233 --> 01:21:35,367
Who addresses the Emperor
in such a raised tone?

559
01:21:35,567 --> 01:21:37,033
That is not true!

560
01:21:38,433 --> 01:21:40,700
I believe in his political abilities.

561
01:21:41,033 --> 01:21:44,233
After all, Adham Khan is
the Emperor's foster and older brother.

562
01:21:44,567 --> 01:21:49,167
He dares to challenge the Emperor's
authority without crown or throne...

563
01:21:49,300 --> 01:21:51,500
- Ni'mat!
... through deceit and injustice!

564
01:21:51,700 --> 01:21:54,033
A thousand scoundrels rolled into one!

565
01:21:54,300 --> 01:21:58,033
I want to know how capable
are you, of ruling the kingdom?

566
01:21:58,833 --> 01:22:03,833
You were nothing. But a puppet
who danced to Bairam Khan's tune.

567
01:22:05,100 --> 01:22:09,567
Don't forget it was my mother,
who guided you.

568
01:22:10,767 --> 01:22:14,167
I too am as capable as you!

569
01:22:16,233 --> 01:22:19,567
Mother, on what grounds could
I have appointed him the Prime Minister?

570
01:22:20,833 --> 01:22:24,833
He has committed
inhuman and shameful crimes.

571
01:22:27,300 --> 01:22:31,833
He has plundered Malwa!
Raped women!

572
01:22:32,767 --> 01:22:35,967
When I declared no prisoner of war
be made into a slave...

573
01:22:36,300 --> 01:22:40,833
...or forced to convert,
Adham disobeyed my orders!

574
01:22:41,700 --> 01:22:44,300
He has done everything I abhor!

575
01:22:46,133 --> 01:22:48,500
Actions I detest!

576
01:22:50,300 --> 01:22:54,500
He has brought disgrace to
the Mughals through his deeds.

577
01:22:54,833 --> 01:22:58,833
And does marrying a Hindu,
bring great honour?

578
01:22:59,033 --> 01:23:00,700
Beware, Adham!

579
01:23:01,533 --> 01:23:04,233
Take the Princess's name with respect!

580
01:23:05,100 --> 01:23:08,100
Don't forget she is now
the Empress of Hindustan!

581
01:23:11,833 --> 01:23:14,933
I won't tolerate any disrespect to her.

582
01:23:18,667 --> 01:23:20,033
Your Majesty!

583
01:23:26,633 --> 01:23:29,733
"Agabgarah"

584
01:23:30,933 --> 01:23:32,033
Disperse!

585
01:23:33,433 --> 01:23:37,467
It is said that bad times
come without warning!

586
01:23:38,467 --> 01:23:40,433
Failing to get Sharifuddin's help...

587
01:23:40,733 --> 01:23:44,467
...Sujamal knocked on other doors
to regain his share of the throne,

588
01:23:45,467 --> 01:23:49,467
Prince Ratan Singh of Ajabgarh
offered him help,

589
01:23:50,133 --> 01:23:53,000
And so did King Rana
Uday Singh of Udaygarh,

590
01:23:53,667 --> 01:23:57,733
To match the military might
of jalaluddin Mohammad...

591
01:23:59,000 --> 01:24:01,533
...we must forget our
differences and join hands.

592
01:24:01,933 --> 01:24:06,933
They agreed to help Sujamal,
But decided to wait for the right time,

593
01:24:07,933 --> 01:24:10,933
I will wipe out the names...

594
01:24:11,267 --> 01:24:14,467
...of jodhaa and jalaluddin
from Rajputana's memory!

595
01:24:14,933 --> 01:24:17,267
No. Don't say that, Ranaji.

596
01:24:18,267 --> 01:24:21,200
jodhaa's plight after marriage,
worries me.

597
01:24:23,267 --> 01:24:25,267
What she must be going through.

598
01:24:26,467 --> 01:24:28,533
I know her well.

599
01:24:29,467 --> 01:24:33,000
She must be unhappy. Very unhappy!

600
01:24:35,933 --> 01:24:38,067
Your Majesty,
this is a difficult question.

601
01:24:39,000 --> 01:24:43,467
I'd like to reply
through an anecdote...

602
01:24:44,333 --> 01:24:45,333
Pray speak!

603
01:24:46,867 --> 01:24:50,667
Your Majesty, the angels were
once asked: 'What is heaven? '

604
01:24:51,800 --> 01:24:57,000
They answered: 'Every heart
where love dwells is heaven itself'!

605
01:24:57,200 --> 01:24:58,200
Well said!

606
01:24:58,667 --> 01:25:01,533
The angels were then asked,
'What is hell? '

607
01:25:02,533 --> 01:25:07,467
They replied: 'A heart
without love is hell itself'!

608
01:25:07,667 --> 01:25:09,000
How true!

609
01:25:10,533 --> 01:25:11,800
Well spoken!

610
01:25:15,200 --> 01:25:17,267
Today's session is over.

611
01:25:33,533 --> 01:25:40,200
People may imagine spring is here
Love, too, is bewildered

612
01:25:47,467 --> 01:25:53,667
Fragrance upstages
the flowers in the garden

613
01:25:54,333 --> 01:25:59,267
Hidden in the veil of nature
is a touch of sorrow

614
01:26:00,467 --> 01:26:07,467
The world around us is mellow
Time is slumbering

615
01:26:07,933 --> 01:26:13,467
Lost and forgotten
memories fill my heart

616
01:26:15,467 --> 01:26:18,800
Rebels must be dealt with severely.

617
01:26:19,000 --> 01:26:24,667
If a ruler is weak,
his kingdom will soon be in disarray.

618
01:26:38,200 --> 01:26:40,467
When it comes to Sharifuddin...

619
01:26:44,533 --> 01:26:47,533
...you will have to eXercise caution.

620
01:26:50,333 --> 01:26:53,667
He is beyond, even my control!

621
01:29:07,267 --> 01:29:09,267
Curse my luck! Lost again.

622
01:29:09,533 --> 01:29:14,133
Never mind. Those who lose
in this game, win in love.

623
01:29:14,667 --> 01:29:18,133
Me? And love?
My luck fails me there too.

624
01:29:20,467 --> 01:29:21,467
Tell me something...

625
01:29:22,533 --> 01:29:26,467
- Have you ever fallen in love?
- Why this sudden question?

626
01:29:27,333 --> 01:29:28,667
It's alright, Neelakshi.

627
01:29:30,067 --> 01:29:34,533
To tell you the truth Ni'mat,
I'm not sure what love is.

628
01:29:36,667 --> 01:29:39,800
Love? A rainbow of feelings!

629
01:29:40,000 --> 01:29:42,467
But you're unlucky in love.
How do you know?

630
01:29:42,533 --> 01:29:47,667
As the palace's Head Eunuch,
do you think I spend my time clapping?

631
01:29:48,000 --> 01:29:48,933
Your Majesty...

632
01:29:50,467 --> 01:29:51,667
I have good news.

633
01:29:52,267 --> 01:29:57,067
The Emperor has ordered a Rajput feast
in your honour on the day of the Pir.

634
01:29:58,400 --> 01:30:01,200
A Rajput feast? In my honour?

635
01:30:01,467 --> 01:30:03,800
Not mine for sure!

636
01:30:04,800 --> 01:30:05,733
And...

637
01:30:07,667 --> 01:30:10,000
...he has sent you this gift.

638
01:30:14,400 --> 01:30:15,800
It is beautiful!

639
01:30:18,533 --> 01:30:22,000
Kindly tell the Emperor,
I like it very much.

640
01:30:22,267 --> 01:30:23,733
Yes, Your Majesty!

641
01:30:24,667 --> 01:30:28,533
This means only one thing.
He's trying to woo you.

642
01:30:30,733 --> 01:30:34,467
If that be so,
I won't be indifferent either.

643
01:30:35,333 --> 01:30:37,467
What do you... propose to do?

644
01:30:39,467 --> 01:30:41,067
I will cook for the feast.

645
01:30:42,667 --> 01:30:48,533
Hear this! Her delicate hands
will grind spices and stir pots.

646
01:30:48,933 --> 01:30:50,400
That will be the day!

647
01:30:51,333 --> 01:30:52,667
You can't do that.

648
01:30:53,000 --> 01:30:54,000
Why not?

649
01:30:54,333 --> 01:30:57,933
Because you are
the Empress of Hindustan!

650
01:30:59,933 --> 01:31:05,533
Then I shall cook as a wife,
not an Empress!

651
01:31:06,467 --> 01:31:07,800
My! My!

652
01:31:21,133 --> 01:31:24,000
Mir Bakawal, why are you gawking?

653
01:31:25,000 --> 01:31:30,533
It's the first time an Empress
has entered the Royal Kitchen.

654
01:31:30,933 --> 01:31:33,133
Your Highness,
does our cooking displease you?

655
01:31:33,200 --> 01:31:36,200
She fears you'll make
mincemeat of the peas!

656
01:31:36,200 --> 01:31:36,733
"Ni'mat" !!!

657
01:31:38,200 --> 01:31:40,467
At your service...

658
01:31:42,000 --> 01:31:43,533
Prepare the ingredients...

659
01:31:43,800 --> 01:31:47,267
Come on! Hear the menu of the day!

660
01:31:52,000 --> 01:31:55,933
Your Majesty, we got the vessels
cleaned, as per your instructions.

661
01:31:59,267 --> 01:32:03,067
What's going on here?
Why aren't you preparing lunch?

662
01:32:03,667 --> 01:32:05,067
Weren't you given the menu?

663
01:32:05,133 --> 01:32:09,267
- We have been given the day off.
- The day off? By whom?

664
01:32:09,933 --> 01:32:11,400
The Empress of Hindustan.

665
01:32:12,533 --> 01:32:16,533
She will cook a vegetarian
Rajput meal with her own hands.

666
01:32:25,933 --> 01:32:30,067
The respected Maham Anga
enters the kitchen!

667
01:32:37,733 --> 01:32:39,933
Keep your distance!

668
01:32:52,133 --> 01:32:55,533
There is a difference in
dreaming and fulfilling dreams.

669
01:32:56,333 --> 01:32:59,733
Do not fool yourself into believing...

670
01:33:00,467 --> 01:33:02,667
...that you have become
an Empress, Princess!

671
01:33:03,400 --> 01:33:05,067
What wrong have I done?

672
01:33:05,467 --> 01:33:07,467
First you had a temple
built in Agra fort...

673
01:33:07,933 --> 01:33:10,267
...now you take
charge of the kitchen...

674
01:33:11,000 --> 01:33:12,667
...I am understanding everything!

675
01:33:13,267 --> 01:33:18,000
What do you mean?
I have taken charge of the kitchen?

676
01:33:18,533 --> 01:33:20,667
Isn't that the right
of every married woman?

677
01:33:23,933 --> 01:33:25,267
Never forget...

678
01:33:26,333 --> 01:33:29,533
...your marriage to jalal
is just an alliance.

679
01:33:30,200 --> 01:33:32,000
In eXchange for peace.

680
01:33:34,000 --> 01:33:35,667
It might be so for you.

681
01:33:36,333 --> 01:33:42,467
For us marriage is a sacred bond,
which ends only in death.

682
01:33:42,533 --> 01:33:45,333
Don't eXplain the
meaning of marriage to me.

683
01:33:46,467 --> 01:33:48,400
What marriage are you talking about?

684
01:33:48,933 --> 01:33:50,800
Which is not yet consummated?

685
01:33:54,667 --> 01:33:56,800
A marriage is complete...

686
01:33:57,667 --> 01:33:59,933
...only when there's an heir.

687
01:34:01,000 --> 01:34:04,467
And since jalal won't
even touch you, an heir?

688
01:34:07,200 --> 01:34:12,067
So Princess jodhaa,
enjoy the world of the Mughals.

689
01:34:12,667 --> 01:34:15,933
But do not try to be part of it.

690
01:34:17,800 --> 01:34:18,533
I...

691
01:34:20,533 --> 01:34:22,400
I can't believe you're saying this.

692
01:34:24,733 --> 01:34:28,933
How do you claim to be
like a mother to him?

693
01:34:29,533 --> 01:34:30,667
Yes!

694
01:34:31,800 --> 01:34:33,467
I am his mother!

695
01:34:35,400 --> 01:34:37,667
I have fed him my milk.

696
01:34:38,533 --> 01:34:42,133
Dedicating every waking hour
to his well-being.

697
01:34:43,000 --> 01:34:47,333
I have protected him from all harm.

698
01:34:48,333 --> 01:34:51,733
Thanks to me no one has touched him.

699
01:34:53,000 --> 01:34:56,800
An arrow was aimed at him
when he was a boy...

700
01:34:57,200 --> 01:35:00,467
...I took it on my chest
and saved him!

701
01:35:01,467 --> 01:35:06,800
If anyone tries to come between
jalal and me, I will destroy them.

702
01:35:08,267 --> 01:35:10,800
I have always kept
him from harm's eye.

703
01:35:12,000 --> 01:35:15,667
You think I'll leave him eXposed to you?

704
01:35:17,067 --> 01:35:18,467
Never!

705
01:35:33,800 --> 01:35:37,667
Rajput Folk Song about Feasts

706
01:36:18,467 --> 01:36:23,000
Your Majesty, the menu
today is dal bati churma...

707
01:36:23,200 --> 01:36:29,800
...ker-sangri, pithode, gatte,
til-papdi and panchmel sabZi.

708
01:36:30,400 --> 01:36:35,467
For dessert, we have
ghevar and sohan halwa.

709
01:36:36,800 --> 01:36:38,267
Well done, Mir Bakawal!

710
01:36:39,000 --> 01:36:40,533
Pardon me, Your Majesty...

711
01:36:40,933 --> 01:36:46,667
...the Rajput Empress
has prepared the feast today, not me.

712
01:36:52,133 --> 01:36:55,200
But Mir Bakawal, this feast
was supposed to be in her honour.

713
01:36:56,467 --> 01:36:58,667
He is not at fault.

714
01:37:00,667 --> 01:37:03,933
I asked him to let me cook.

715
01:37:04,533 --> 01:37:05,933
Why did you take the trouble?

716
01:37:06,133 --> 01:37:10,333
It's no trouble.
I consider it my good fortune.

717
01:37:12,667 --> 01:37:16,667
Pardon me, Your Majesty.
Let me remind you...

718
01:37:17,133 --> 01:37:22,067
...according to the law,
food served to the Emperor...

719
01:37:22,667 --> 01:37:24,933
...must first be tasted by the cook.

720
01:37:26,267 --> 01:37:29,667
Only then, is it safe
for the Emperor to eat.

721
01:37:30,800 --> 01:37:35,400
Since Empress jodhaa
has made the feast today...

722
01:37:36,333 --> 01:37:38,533
...Iet her say 'Bismillah' and begin.

723
01:37:43,000 --> 01:37:46,933
Matters of security
must be respected.

724
01:37:47,800 --> 01:37:51,400
Even the Emperor cannot object.

725
01:37:55,267 --> 01:38:00,200
Taste the food, Empress!
Please do the honours.

726
01:39:42,667 --> 01:39:45,667
Your Majesty, the food is safe
to be served!

727
01:39:48,000 --> 01:39:52,800
Your Majesty...
you may now enjoy the repast.

728
01:39:58,800 --> 01:40:01,667
Bring me the dishes
the Empress has tasted.

729
01:40:04,200 --> 01:40:07,133
I wish to eat from the same plate!

730
01:40:28,267 --> 01:40:29,333
Wait!

731
01:40:33,133 --> 01:40:34,667
Do not eat that!

732
01:40:36,467 --> 01:40:37,667
Why not?

733
01:40:37,933 --> 01:40:38,933
It has...

734
01:40:39,267 --> 01:40:41,467
...Iess salt.

735
01:41:18,667 --> 01:41:20,667
The food is eXquisite.

736
01:41:22,800 --> 01:41:25,400
Every morsel deserves praise!

737
01:41:27,733 --> 01:41:29,533
I have enjoyed it so much...

738
01:41:30,533 --> 01:41:36,200
I declare on the day of the Pir,
I will only eat vegetarian food...

739
01:41:36,533 --> 01:41:39,000
...from Empress jodhaa's kitchen!

740
01:41:43,933 --> 01:41:47,133
It is hard to describe this affliction

741
01:41:47,333 --> 01:41:50,267
I wonder to myself

742
01:41:50,400 --> 01:41:56,133
Does she belong to me?

743
01:41:57,800 --> 01:42:03,933
We walk side by side
but distance separates us

744
01:42:04,267 --> 01:42:10,200
Like two shores of
the ocean that never meet

745
01:42:11,667 --> 01:42:14,667
She is near yet so far

746
01:42:15,000 --> 01:42:18,000
I cannot endure this yearning

747
01:42:18,467 --> 01:42:24,467
A wall of glass keeps us apart

748
01:42:26,067 --> 01:42:31,933
No one should be allowed
to trade in grain without our consent.

749
01:42:32,467 --> 01:42:33,933
Another suggestion -

750
01:42:35,267 --> 01:42:38,467
In certain provinces
people are suffering from drought.

751
01:42:38,933 --> 01:42:41,800
Their taXes should be waived!

752
01:42:43,467 --> 01:42:44,800
You are right, Khan Baba.

753
01:42:46,467 --> 01:42:49,667
Ensure both the policies
are implemented immediately.

754
01:42:49,933 --> 01:42:51,000
Your Majesty!

755
01:43:05,933 --> 01:43:07,000
O my God!

756
01:43:07,667 --> 01:43:13,467
I heard a song
My heart chose her

757
01:43:13,800 --> 01:43:19,467
What is this story
that time tells me?

758
01:43:21,467 --> 01:43:26,933
O Allah! If the Emperor hears
about this, he will free me too!

759
01:43:28,267 --> 01:43:31,933
Their freedom is more
important than yours.

760
01:43:38,667 --> 01:43:41,733
If I am filled with sadness

761
01:43:42,000 --> 01:43:45,000
She is forlorn too

762
01:43:45,267 --> 01:43:50,933
Loneliness casts a shadow
on our encounters

763
01:43:52,800 --> 01:43:59,267
We meet and yet we do not meet,
Flowers bloom and yet they do not

764
01:43:59,667 --> 01:44:05,467
Spring in our eyes,
autumn in our hearts

765
01:44:07,733 --> 01:44:14,067
jodhaa, I do not want to go on
this provincial tour, but duty calls.

766
01:44:23,000 --> 01:44:25,933
The Empress sits in the palanquin.

767
01:44:27,000 --> 01:44:30,933
- In the name of Allah!
- In the shelter of Allah!

768
01:44:59,800 --> 01:45:01,800
You did well!

769
01:45:02,800 --> 01:45:04,800
Now I will trap her with this.

770
01:45:05,400 --> 01:45:06,267
Trap?

771
01:45:06,467 --> 01:45:10,400
But Mahambi, she wrote this letter
before she was married.

772
01:45:11,267 --> 01:45:14,467
- How do you know that?
- Neelakshi told me.

773
01:45:15,467 --> 01:45:20,933
Remember! You know nothing.

774
01:45:22,467 --> 01:45:25,733
And don't you dare
talk to anyone about this!

775
01:45:26,533 --> 01:45:28,467
Or else...

776
01:45:30,533 --> 01:45:37,800
Princess jodhaa!
Trying to be too clever, is she?

777
01:45:42,533 --> 01:45:47,067
I implore you. I have tried hard
to contact you. There's still time.

778
01:45:47,933 --> 01:45:54,267
Come and protect me, my brother.
Yours, jodhaa.

779
01:46:02,267 --> 01:46:08,733
Sujamal, she reminds you of your
brotherly duty. You must go!

780
01:46:09,533 --> 01:46:14,533
Have you lost your mind?
It's a trap!

781
01:46:15,467 --> 01:46:18,933
Why would she call you
to a lion's den?

782
01:46:20,533 --> 01:46:25,000
Entering the Agra fort means,
inviting death.

783
01:46:27,667 --> 01:46:31,533
Ranaji, at the cost
of losing my life, I will go...

784
01:46:32,000 --> 01:46:34,267
You have indeed lost
your mind, Sujamal!

785
01:46:35,200 --> 01:46:38,533
Go if you wish.
And spend the rest of your life...

786
01:46:38,933 --> 01:46:41,533
...admiring the dungeons of Agra fort!

787
01:46:42,933 --> 01:46:44,333
I will go.

788
01:46:48,667 --> 01:46:51,267
Sharifuddin, I'm sensing trouble.

789
01:46:51,667 --> 01:46:54,067
I'm in danger of being found out.

790
01:46:54,667 --> 01:46:57,667
The Prime Minister
Shamsuddin Atka Khan...

791
01:46:58,733 --> 01:47:02,333
...has discovered that
I've embeZZled taX money.

792
01:47:04,800 --> 01:47:08,000
Adham, my brother,
there's only one way out.

793
01:47:09,267 --> 01:47:15,067
Before Shamsuddin
unravels the truth to Todarmal...

794
01:47:16,267 --> 01:47:18,467
...he must be stopped!

795
01:47:20,267 --> 01:47:22,133
Can I be of any help?

796
01:47:24,467 --> 01:47:27,533
After all, I am indebted
to you and your mother...

797
01:47:28,533 --> 01:47:30,667
...for my position in the Mughal army.

798
01:47:31,933 --> 01:47:32,933
No.

799
01:47:34,333 --> 01:47:36,667
I will act alone!

800
01:47:37,133 --> 01:47:41,000
Adham, my brother, be cautious...

801
01:47:41,733 --> 01:47:45,400
...whatever you do,
don't leave it unfinished.

802
01:47:50,667 --> 01:47:54,467
TaXes have been embeZZled
in the province of Malwa alone.

803
01:47:55,200 --> 01:48:00,400
Tally the figures in these documents
and you will see for yourself.

804
01:48:02,267 --> 01:48:05,267
But Malwa comes under Adham.

805
01:48:06,067 --> 01:48:08,533
- You mean...
- I have always suspected him.

806
01:48:10,667 --> 01:48:12,133
Today I have proof too!

807
01:48:12,733 --> 01:48:14,933
Shamsuddin Atka Khan Sahib!

808
01:48:16,667 --> 01:48:20,533
I must praise your auditing
and revenue collection skills.

809
01:48:21,000 --> 01:48:23,000
How well you count!

810
01:48:23,800 --> 01:48:26,000
But when it comes
to my province Malwa...

811
01:48:26,267 --> 01:48:30,000
...you will have to ignore
certain figures.

812
01:48:30,800 --> 01:48:32,067
Consider them a concession.

813
01:48:32,667 --> 01:48:35,933
You forget your responsibility
as the Emperor's elder brother.

814
01:48:36,800 --> 01:48:39,800
Moreover you happily eXtort
your province to fill your pockets.

815
01:48:41,000 --> 01:48:44,667
- This is sheer cheating!
- Not cheating, a privilege!

816
01:48:45,467 --> 01:48:48,067
I advise you, Khan Baba...

817
01:48:48,667 --> 01:48:53,800
...to not interfere in my affairs or else...
- Adham Khan!

818
01:48:54,533 --> 01:49:00,000
Challenging a Prime Minister is
no less than challenging the Emperor.

819
01:49:16,267 --> 01:49:17,800
Disaster, Your Majesty!

820
01:49:17,933 --> 01:49:20,200
Adham Khan has entered
the women's palace with a sword.

821
01:49:20,333 --> 01:49:22,733
He murdered the Prime Minister!

822
01:49:36,400 --> 01:49:41,000
You insolent, ungrateful wretch.
How dare you!

823
01:49:41,800 --> 01:49:44,467
You killed a man,
who was like a father to me.

824
01:49:49,000 --> 01:49:51,400
Arrest this miserable wretch!

825
01:49:55,000 --> 01:49:57,667
Today you have crossed all limits!

826
01:49:58,200 --> 01:50:01,133
You killed Khan Baba
to hide your heinous crimes!

827
01:50:01,533 --> 01:50:05,133
Not only was he loyal
to the Mughal Empire...

828
01:50:05,933 --> 01:50:08,133
...but also a man of God!

829
01:50:09,000 --> 01:50:11,067
I considered him a father.

830
01:50:14,333 --> 01:50:16,000
His punishment is...

831
01:50:16,400 --> 01:50:17,800
...throw him down...

832
01:50:18,333 --> 01:50:19,400
...head first!

833
01:50:20,467 --> 01:50:22,933
No, jalal!

834
01:50:35,333 --> 01:50:36,267
Carry out the order!

835
01:50:44,133 --> 01:50:48,533
- Is he dead?
- No, Your Majesty. He is alive.

836
01:50:49,467 --> 01:50:52,200
Then bring him up.
And throw him down again!

837
01:51:37,200 --> 01:51:38,067
Your Majesty...

838
01:51:49,200 --> 01:51:50,667
Keep your distance!

839
01:52:22,000 --> 01:52:23,200
Elder Mother...

840
01:52:24,533 --> 01:52:27,933
...I had to kill Adham
for the terrible crime he committed.

841
01:52:32,467 --> 01:52:34,667
justice demanded his life,
Elder Mother.

842
01:52:37,067 --> 01:52:38,533
I understand.

843
01:52:40,067 --> 01:52:45,533
Adham was wrong and
had to pay for his crime.

844
01:52:47,733 --> 01:52:50,200
That is why I forgive you, jalal!

845
01:52:53,733 --> 01:52:59,200
I know that nothing can come
between you and the throne.

846
01:53:02,800 --> 01:53:04,267
And in my view...

847
01:53:06,200 --> 01:53:10,067
...jodhaa too, should not
make any such attempt!

848
01:53:10,800 --> 01:53:11,733
jodhaa?

849
01:53:14,000 --> 01:53:15,533
Why do you speak of her?

850
01:53:22,933 --> 01:53:24,733
Do you know what this is?

851
01:53:26,733 --> 01:53:28,333
A vial of poison!

852
01:53:30,533 --> 01:53:32,533
It was found in jodhaa's belongings.

853
01:53:37,800 --> 01:53:41,333
My greatest fear is now coming true.

854
01:53:43,000 --> 01:53:44,000
Fear?

855
01:53:45,200 --> 01:53:50,933
Don't forget, even
priceless brass turns black!

856
01:53:52,733 --> 01:53:56,867
Find out whom she writes to,
besides her family.

857
01:54:01,933 --> 01:54:04,533
What are you insinuating?

858
01:54:05,933 --> 01:54:10,333
She was betrothed
to the Prince of Ajabgarh.

859
01:54:11,600 --> 01:54:14,333
Then she married you. Why?

860
01:54:15,800 --> 01:54:21,000
She is an assassin sent by the Rajputs
in disguise of a beautiful wife.

861
01:54:30,533 --> 01:54:32,467
Are you saying that...

862
01:54:33,333 --> 01:54:36,200
...she sent a message
to the Prince of Ajabgarh?

863
01:54:37,333 --> 01:54:39,733
You are no longer a child, jalal.

864
01:54:41,533 --> 01:54:43,200
She's your wife!

865
01:54:44,200 --> 01:54:47,067
Yet why does she resist intimacy?

866
01:54:49,533 --> 01:54:50,800
Because...

867
01:54:51,200 --> 01:54:56,467
...she's still in love with
that Rajput Prince of Ajabgarh.

868
01:54:58,267 --> 01:55:00,000
Someone is coming to see her soon.

869
01:55:04,067 --> 01:55:09,267
No matter how much light,
a mirror reflects, it has a dark side.

870
01:55:58,267 --> 01:55:59,533
How is my jodhaa?

871
01:56:00,600 --> 01:56:04,533
I was worried about you.
Why did you want to meet me in secret?

872
01:56:05,333 --> 01:56:08,667
You mentioned in your letter that
you're coming to take me away? But why?

873
01:56:09,000 --> 01:56:13,333
I knew you were unhappy.
I read your letter and came at once.

874
01:56:14,000 --> 01:56:17,467
- Letter? What letter?
- The one that you sent.

875
01:56:18,200 --> 01:56:19,733
I sent no letter.

876
01:56:21,200 --> 01:56:22,667
What do you mean?

877
01:56:24,800 --> 01:56:28,067
- Here it is and your rakhi too.
- This rakhi...

878
01:56:35,867 --> 01:56:40,000
I did... write this letter
before I got married.

879
01:56:40,600 --> 01:56:45,800
But never sent it,
thinking you had your own worries.

880
01:56:47,000 --> 01:56:48,533
How are you, brother?

881
01:56:49,800 --> 01:56:52,600
Me? I am well.

882
01:56:53,333 --> 01:56:55,800
just wandering about
without kingdom or home.

883
01:56:56,200 --> 01:56:59,867
Never mind me.
I was worried about you all along.

884
01:57:02,800 --> 01:57:05,867
Brother, I am happy here.

885
01:57:06,467 --> 01:57:08,800
Happy? What do you mean?

886
01:57:09,200 --> 01:57:11,533
You were forced to marry
and you say you're happy?

887
01:57:11,867 --> 01:57:14,000
It's not as you think.

888
01:57:14,600 --> 01:57:19,067
The Emperor did not convert me.
He even built a temple for me.

889
01:57:19,933 --> 01:57:20,933
What?

890
01:57:23,200 --> 01:57:24,600
I knew nothing of this.

891
01:57:26,067 --> 01:57:31,200
I am saddened by
what you have endured, brother.

892
01:57:59,000 --> 01:58:00,667
One thing still bothers me.

893
01:58:02,333 --> 01:58:06,000
If you didn't send me the letter,
then who did?

894
01:58:08,733 --> 01:58:11,200
Arrest him!

895
01:58:14,533 --> 01:58:16,200
The Emperor?

896
01:58:26,267 --> 01:58:28,267
So this was a trap set up by you!

897
01:58:30,467 --> 01:58:31,933
You betrayed me, jodhaa!

898
01:58:32,467 --> 01:58:33,600
No, brother.

899
01:58:34,200 --> 01:58:36,000
That is why you sent the letter.

900
01:58:37,467 --> 01:58:40,800
Don't misunderstand.
I have nothing to do with this.

901
01:58:43,600 --> 01:58:47,000
jodhaa, this rakhi will
always stay on my wrist...

902
01:58:48,467 --> 01:58:50,533
...it will be a reminder
of your treachery!

903
01:58:52,933 --> 01:58:54,333
Brother!

904
01:59:10,867 --> 01:59:12,333
Your Majesty!

905
01:59:41,667 --> 01:59:44,467
For his treachery against
the Mughal Empire...

906
01:59:45,267 --> 01:59:47,600
...arrest the traitor Ni'mat!

907
01:59:48,000 --> 01:59:51,733
No, Your Majesty!
Save me, my Empress!

908
01:59:52,867 --> 01:59:57,067
He isn't to be blamed.
He was only following my orders.

909
02:00:02,333 --> 02:00:04,000
May I know...

910
02:00:05,467 --> 02:00:06,800
...what was so important...

911
02:00:09,200 --> 02:00:12,000
...that you saw it fit
to hide it from your husband...

912
02:00:13,000 --> 02:00:18,333
...and sneak out in the
middle of the night to meet a stranger.

913
02:00:22,000 --> 02:00:23,200
Who was he?

914
02:00:24,267 --> 02:00:25,733
The Prince of Ajabgarh?

915
02:00:28,067 --> 02:00:29,533
The Prince of Ajabgarh?

916
02:00:29,867 --> 02:00:33,867
- But...
- You have betrayed me!

917
02:00:34,733 --> 02:00:37,200
- Betrayed?
- Yes!

918
02:00:39,200 --> 02:00:41,533
Elder Mother had warned me.

919
02:00:42,667 --> 02:00:45,533
It is not me, but Maham Anga,
who has betrayed you!

920
02:00:46,333 --> 02:00:51,200
How can she ever betray me?
She has nurtured and raised me.

921
02:00:52,000 --> 02:00:55,467
Probably that's the reason,
I too have shown her respect.

922
02:00:57,067 --> 02:01:01,800
But the same Maham Anga
has tried to keep us apart.

923
02:01:03,000 --> 02:01:06,467
She planted a vile seed of doubt
in your mind against me.

924
02:01:07,533 --> 02:01:10,467
- What would you call her, Your Majesty!
- Silence!

925
02:01:12,933 --> 02:01:15,733
I will not tolerate
a word against Elder Mother.

926
02:01:17,867 --> 02:01:20,733
just as you will not entertain
a word against her...

927
02:01:22,000 --> 02:01:26,000
...I too cannot hear a word
against my integrity and honour.

928
02:01:32,000 --> 02:01:33,733
How unfortunate I am!

929
02:01:34,533 --> 02:01:39,533
just when I had started to find
love, trust and happiness...

930
02:01:41,000 --> 02:01:43,000
...why did this have to happen?

931
02:01:47,267 --> 02:01:52,000
Since I am accused of treason, you may
as well let me know my punishment.

932
02:01:53,600 --> 02:01:56,467
You will go back to your family!

933
02:02:02,533 --> 02:02:05,333
Since love must be based on trust...

934
02:02:07,467 --> 02:02:09,467
...it would be best...

935
02:02:10,600 --> 02:02:12,067
...that I go.

936
02:02:13,267 --> 02:02:17,533
Prepare the Empress of Hindustan's
departure at once!

937
02:02:45,867 --> 02:02:52,000
People may imagine spring is here

938
02:03:05,467 --> 02:03:10,533
Love too, is bewildered

939
02:03:14,667 --> 02:03:25,067
Fragrance upstages
the flowers in the garden

940
02:03:27,333 --> 02:03:37,933
Hidden in the veil of nature
is a touch of sorrow

941
02:03:40,333 --> 02:03:45,800
The world around us is mellow

942
02:03:47,200 --> 02:03:52,600
Time is slumbering

943
02:03:53,067 --> 02:04:02,200
Lost and forgotten memories
fill my heart

944
02:04:07,200 --> 02:04:08,467
What have you done?

945
02:04:08,733 --> 02:04:13,733
You consider him your son,
and yet tried to wreck his marriage?

946
02:04:14,000 --> 02:04:16,200
I was only doing my duty.

947
02:04:16,333 --> 02:04:20,333
Duty? I tolerated your misdeeds,
you pass off as duty.

948
02:04:20,533 --> 02:04:23,000
I have never interfered.

949
02:04:23,333 --> 02:04:26,733
But enough is enough!
This is a limit!

950
02:04:27,333 --> 02:04:29,733
He wasn't the Prince of Ajabgarh...

951
02:04:30,000 --> 02:04:31,867
...but jodhaa's brother, Sujamal.

952
02:04:32,933 --> 02:04:33,933
What?

953
02:04:36,333 --> 02:04:37,467
What about that letter?

954
02:04:37,733 --> 02:04:40,533
Are you even aware of
what was written?

955
02:04:41,000 --> 02:04:45,000
jodhaa wrote it before she got married,
but never sent it.

956
02:04:45,467 --> 02:04:50,000
And Maham Anga used the letter
to poison your mind against her.

957
02:04:52,733 --> 02:04:54,600
I can't believe it, Mother!

958
02:04:58,533 --> 02:05:00,000
Elder Mother, is it true?

959
02:05:01,467 --> 02:05:05,200
This is a blatant lie.
I have been wrongly accused!

960
02:05:06,200 --> 02:05:08,200
I'm innocent, Empress!

961
02:05:08,333 --> 02:05:10,667
Silence, Maham Anga!

962
02:05:11,867 --> 02:05:15,867
Lower your voice
when speaking to my mother!

963
02:05:22,600 --> 02:05:24,333
Answer my question.

964
02:05:26,533 --> 02:05:29,333
Is it true or not?

965
02:05:32,600 --> 02:05:34,667
Salima will answer this question.

966
02:05:35,733 --> 02:05:36,667
Salima!

967
02:05:44,933 --> 02:05:46,000
Speak up, Salima.

968
02:05:53,667 --> 02:05:55,533
Have no fear. Tell us the truth!

969
02:05:56,467 --> 02:06:02,200
Your Majesty, I brought it to
respected Maham Anga's notice...

970
02:06:03,000 --> 02:06:05,733
...that the letter was written
before marriage...

971
02:06:06,333 --> 02:06:12,333
...but she threatened me and
used the letter for her own ends.

972
02:06:16,067 --> 02:06:17,667
O God!

973
02:06:19,200 --> 02:06:21,533
I have made a terrible mistake...

974
02:06:22,867 --> 02:06:24,800
What have I done?

975
02:06:25,667 --> 02:06:27,200
What have I done?

976
02:06:33,667 --> 02:06:36,067
I gave you the status of a mother...

977
02:06:40,800 --> 02:06:43,733
...and you poisoned my mind
against jodhaa?

978
02:06:47,467 --> 02:06:50,267
You have broken my trust in you.

979
02:06:52,067 --> 02:06:57,067
You have erased all the good memories...
I had of you!

980
02:07:01,000 --> 02:07:04,067
Is this why I called you 'Elder Mother'?

981
02:07:11,800 --> 02:07:14,000
You have nurtured me all my life.

982
02:07:15,533 --> 02:07:18,000
Only for that, I forgive you!

983
02:07:19,333 --> 02:07:20,867
Nevertheless, from now...

984
02:07:22,533 --> 02:07:25,200
...I will never see your face again.

985
02:08:04,467 --> 02:08:06,733
Bring her back, jalal!

986
02:08:08,733 --> 02:08:10,200
I don't know...

987
02:08:13,067 --> 02:08:14,467
...how I shall face her.

988
02:08:15,000 --> 02:08:18,800
Admitting a mistake
only makes love grow deeper.

989
02:08:19,200 --> 02:08:22,067
I am convinced that jodhaa will accept.

990
02:09:09,067 --> 02:09:13,333
- Didn't I tell you, he'd come?
- I still can't believe it!

991
02:09:16,933 --> 02:09:18,067
Welcome!

992
02:09:19,200 --> 02:09:23,867
It is an honour and a privilege
to have you here in Amer.

993
02:09:35,067 --> 02:09:41,067
May this vermilion mark signify a
strong bond between Mughals and Rajputs!

994
02:09:43,467 --> 02:09:47,000
No matter what he says,
I will not go back.

995
02:09:47,733 --> 02:09:49,933
But are you not going to welcome him?

996
02:09:50,533 --> 02:09:53,733
Now wipe the frown off your face
and draw the veil.

997
02:10:46,333 --> 02:10:49,200
Whom do my son-in-law's eyes seek?

998
02:10:51,667 --> 02:10:53,333
We have a custom in Amer.

999
02:10:53,733 --> 02:10:57,733
When a son-in-law
visits for the first time...

1000
02:10:58,200 --> 02:11:02,733
...he must find his bride
among the women of the palace.

1001
02:11:03,333 --> 02:11:08,733
If he succeeds,
he gets to stay in his wife's chamber.

1002
02:11:09,667 --> 02:11:13,800
And if he fails,
he has to sleep under the open sky...

1003
02:11:14,067 --> 02:11:16,200
...counting the stars!!

1004
02:11:19,467 --> 02:11:21,333
Come! Welcome, son-in-law...

1005
02:12:38,333 --> 02:12:40,933
So you finally found your jodhaa!

1006
02:12:57,600 --> 02:13:01,800
- Will you come back with me?
- No, I'm not going anywhere!

1007
02:13:11,000 --> 02:13:13,200
I have come to take you home.

1008
02:13:14,200 --> 02:13:15,733
Why do you now refuse?

1009
02:13:17,000 --> 02:13:19,533
I will not go back to Agra!

1010
02:13:28,467 --> 02:13:34,000
It feels strange being here,
alone with you, in this chamber.

1011
02:13:35,467 --> 02:13:36,800
It is strange!

1012
02:13:37,733 --> 02:13:39,467
But I have a solution...

1013
02:13:41,000 --> 02:13:42,467
And what might that be?

1014
02:13:53,067 --> 02:13:55,267
This is too harsh a punishment.

1015
02:13:58,267 --> 02:14:00,333
Now I cannot see my face...

1016
02:14:02,067 --> 02:14:04,333
...reflected in your eyes!

1017
02:14:07,333 --> 02:14:08,533
This is unjust!

1018
02:14:10,533 --> 02:14:11,733
jodhaa...

1019
02:14:29,200 --> 02:14:31,600
jodhaa, I have eXpressed regret.

1020
02:14:32,867 --> 02:14:35,333
You can't win me
by just eXpressing regret.

1021
02:14:36,200 --> 02:14:38,067
But you will never understand this.

1022
02:14:42,200 --> 02:14:43,067
I don't understand?

1023
02:14:43,733 --> 02:14:45,200
No, you don't!

1024
02:14:47,067 --> 02:14:51,333
You know how to wage war and conquer.
But do not know how to rule.

1025
02:14:52,000 --> 02:14:53,000
What did you say?

1026
02:14:53,333 --> 02:14:58,000
That you have only conquered me...

1027
02:14:58,533 --> 02:15:00,000
...but not won my heart yet.

1028
02:15:02,200 --> 02:15:06,267
This is unfair.
I have fulfilled your every wish...

1029
02:15:07,667 --> 02:15:09,667
...I have respected
every demand of yours...

1030
02:15:10,533 --> 02:15:12,467
...I have carried out
my duties as a husband!

1031
02:15:13,467 --> 02:15:14,867
If that were true...

1032
02:15:15,467 --> 02:15:19,067
...you'd never have sent me away
without hearing my side.

1033
02:15:20,067 --> 02:15:21,333
But this...

1034
02:15:23,067 --> 02:15:26,533
But try and understand that
considering the circumstances...

1035
02:15:26,867 --> 02:15:29,000
...a misunderstanding was inevitable.

1036
02:15:32,467 --> 02:15:35,733
But you should have at least tried
to know what really happened.

1037
02:15:38,333 --> 02:15:41,800
But the truth is that,
you are far removed from reality...

1038
02:15:43,000 --> 02:15:45,267
...you do not know how to win hearts.

1039
02:15:46,067 --> 02:15:50,000
To do that, you need
to look into their minds...

1040
02:15:50,933 --> 02:15:55,000
...discover their
little pleasures and sorrows.

1041
02:15:55,733 --> 02:15:59,200
And win their trust.
Be one with their heartbeat!

1042
02:15:59,867 --> 02:16:03,533
And the day you will
succeed in doing that...

1043
02:16:04,267 --> 02:16:06,733
...you will rule my heart!

1044
02:16:54,533 --> 02:16:56,533
Forgive me, jodhaa.

1045
02:18:32,033 --> 02:18:33,200
EXcellent!

1046
02:18:35,200 --> 02:18:37,200
Now, if you defeat me...

1047
02:18:39,467 --> 02:18:41,733
...you can gladly stay back in Amer.

1048
02:18:47,600 --> 02:18:49,533
And if I win...

1049
02:18:51,000 --> 02:18:53,267
...then you will have
to return with me.

1050
02:18:56,567 --> 02:18:57,567
Raise your sword!

1051
02:19:02,567 --> 02:19:04,033
Raise it!

1052
02:19:22,733 --> 02:19:23,967
EXcellent!

1053
02:20:01,033 --> 02:20:02,433
Allah be praised!

1054
02:20:18,167 --> 02:20:19,700
Empress of Hindustan...

1055
02:20:21,167 --> 02:20:23,033
...do not forget,
I am your husband!

1056
02:20:43,767 --> 02:20:45,433
Disperse!

1057
02:20:50,233 --> 02:20:51,833
O Allah...

1058
02:20:55,300 --> 02:20:57,633
There is a saying in Persian:

1059
02:20:58,767 --> 02:21:03,300
'Why seek Paradise?
It is before me now! '

1060
02:22:19,700 --> 02:22:21,433
I will not go back!

1061
02:23:08,633 --> 02:23:09,700
Princess!

1062
02:23:12,833 --> 02:23:13,767
I won!

1063
02:23:15,900 --> 02:23:19,500
This is unfair. Gira interrupted...

1064
02:23:19,900 --> 02:23:24,767
Regardless! I won and you lost.

1065
02:23:27,700 --> 02:23:31,967
Gira, could you not have waited?
You made me lose.

1066
02:23:32,300 --> 02:23:36,033
Forgive me. An envoy brings
a message for His Majesty.

1067
02:23:37,500 --> 02:23:39,233
Ask him to wait.

1068
02:23:41,967 --> 02:23:43,833
Forgive her, jodhaa.

1069
02:23:44,500 --> 02:23:48,567
Remember, a moment's distraction can
prove fatal in battle and can bring...

1070
02:23:48,700 --> 02:23:52,233
'... defeat or death.' I know!

1071
02:23:56,233 --> 02:23:58,500
Where did you learn to duel so well?

1072
02:24:00,700 --> 02:24:02,567
My brother Sujamal taught me the art!

1073
02:24:03,033 --> 02:24:04,967
He has taught you well.

1074
02:24:05,967 --> 02:24:07,967
I was lucky to have won.

1075
02:24:10,167 --> 02:24:11,900
Now prepare to leave.

1076
02:24:16,900 --> 02:24:18,433
I will not go.

1077
02:24:20,567 --> 02:24:22,567
Now this goes against your protocol.

1078
02:24:23,033 --> 02:24:25,433
Being the Empress of Hindustan,
you cannot go back on your word.

1079
02:24:25,633 --> 02:24:27,700
I do as I please.

1080
02:24:28,233 --> 02:24:31,167
- I will not go!
- And now, I won't force you.

1081
02:24:31,767 --> 02:24:33,433
Do you know why?

1082
02:24:37,967 --> 02:24:41,033
My heart says,
you will come on your own accord.

1083
02:24:44,567 --> 02:24:46,167
You will come.

1084
02:24:47,167 --> 02:24:51,300
Because by then...
I would have won your heart!

1085
02:25:11,700 --> 02:25:14,433
Your Majesty, why are you doing this?

1086
02:25:14,900 --> 02:25:18,033
Roaming in the baZaar
without guards is dangerous.

1087
02:25:18,167 --> 02:25:20,433
Do not worry.
No one will recogniZe me.

1088
02:25:20,900 --> 02:25:24,300
I'm doing it since there's a difference
between conquering and ruling!

1089
02:25:24,967 --> 02:25:27,567
To win the hearts of people,
one must look into their minds.

1090
02:25:28,167 --> 02:25:31,700
Another thing... do not address me
as 'Your Majesty'.

1091
02:25:32,500 --> 02:25:34,300
Then what do I call you?

1092
02:25:34,967 --> 02:25:36,700
Call me jalal.

1093
02:25:53,967 --> 02:25:56,033
Where do we start, Mahesh Das?

1094
02:26:01,500 --> 02:26:04,833
- Greetings!
- Greetings!

1095
02:26:17,167 --> 02:26:20,767
Will your eyes only feast or
do you even intend to buy anything?

1096
02:26:21,567 --> 02:26:25,633
- How much is the grain?
- Three coins for a pound.

1097
02:26:27,167 --> 02:26:31,167
- The barley?
- Two coins for a pound. Shall I pack it?

1098
02:26:31,633 --> 02:26:34,233
We'll buy wheat instead.

1099
02:26:34,767 --> 02:26:39,633
- Wheat? Two coins for a pound.
- Two coins for a pound?!

1100
02:26:40,167 --> 02:26:44,500
What can we do?
The landowners decide the price.

1101
02:26:44,833 --> 02:26:46,300
His prices are sky high.

1102
02:26:47,433 --> 02:26:49,500
Looks like you too
have dropped from the sky!

1103
02:26:49,833 --> 02:26:53,167
You're pockets are empty and
you want to buy Agra baZaar?

1104
02:26:53,300 --> 02:26:55,767
Take it or leave it!

1105
02:26:56,500 --> 02:26:59,167
Insolent fool! Do you know with whom
you have an audience?

1106
02:26:59,500 --> 02:27:01,900
An audience? Move on!

1107
02:27:02,033 --> 02:27:04,700
Let's go. We'll try the neXt shop.

1108
02:27:07,500 --> 02:27:08,633
Move on!

1109
02:27:10,567 --> 02:27:13,633
Get your fresh tobacco here!

1110
02:27:17,300 --> 02:27:19,700
Silence! Arrest him!!

1111
02:27:24,700 --> 02:27:25,900
What's going on there?

1112
02:27:28,300 --> 02:27:29,433
Master, forgive me.

1113
02:27:29,700 --> 02:27:32,700
- We must go back.
- No, wait.

1114
02:27:33,700 --> 02:27:34,633
This is what I've come to see.

1115
02:27:34,767 --> 02:27:39,567
- This Mughal officer is unjust.
- Yes, indeed! Too much atrocity!

1116
02:27:40,700 --> 02:27:42,900
But he is a loyal officer
of the Mughal Court...

1117
02:27:44,767 --> 02:27:46,833
- Are you new here?
- Yes.

1118
02:27:47,433 --> 02:27:49,967
Another blind man
in the land of the blind!

1119
02:27:50,433 --> 02:27:52,767
Can't you see how these foreigners behave?

1120
02:27:53,167 --> 02:27:56,033
- What foreigners?
- These Mughals!

1121
02:27:56,167 --> 02:27:58,300
They are all outsiders.

1122
02:27:58,633 --> 02:28:00,767
The Emperor's court is full of them.

1123
02:28:01,967 --> 02:28:04,967
I have heard that,
the Emperor is a very good man.

1124
02:28:05,833 --> 02:28:10,167
He is doing a lot for the common man.
Why not complain to him directly?

1125
02:28:10,433 --> 02:28:13,300
Forget it, Mister!
We can only complain to our near ones.

1126
02:28:13,700 --> 02:28:15,433
And we do not believe that
the Emperor is a Hindustani.

1127
02:28:15,833 --> 02:28:19,433
The Mughals or any others,
they are all outsiders!

1128
02:28:19,700 --> 02:28:23,967
Did you know our Emperor
was born in Amarkot...

1129
02:28:24,300 --> 02:28:26,767
...in a Hindu Rajput home?
And raised here too?

1130
02:28:27,167 --> 02:28:30,500
So how can you call him a foreigner?
He is as much an lndian as you are.

1131
02:28:30,767 --> 02:28:35,233
Really? If he is an lndian then
what has he done for the common man?

1132
02:28:36,700 --> 02:28:39,900
If this Emperor cares so much then...

1133
02:28:40,500 --> 02:28:42,633
...why doesn't he abolish the Pilgrim TaX?

1134
02:28:42,967 --> 02:28:44,167
The Pilgrim TaX?

1135
02:28:44,967 --> 02:28:48,033
Looks like you're new
not only to Agra but to the country!

1136
02:28:48,700 --> 02:28:52,433
Don't we all Hindus have to pay
Pilgrim TaX when we go on pilgrimage?

1137
02:28:54,900 --> 02:28:57,167
It does not worry the rich.

1138
02:28:57,967 --> 02:29:04,500
But the common man can't pay
such taXes. So we suffer...

1139
02:29:05,500 --> 02:29:08,500
...but what's the use?
Nobody pays any attention.

1140
02:29:10,633 --> 02:29:13,233
Let's go!

1141
02:29:18,233 --> 02:29:21,500
Coming here incognito has proved
most useful, Your Majesty.

1142
02:29:21,967 --> 02:29:24,900
Now we know how people
perceive the Mughal rule.

1143
02:29:25,500 --> 02:29:27,433
What is this Pilgrim TaX?

1144
02:29:29,700 --> 02:29:34,033
When the Hindus go on pilgrimage
to pray to their Gods...

1145
02:29:34,900 --> 02:29:38,033
...they have to pay a taX
to the Mughal Treasury.

1146
02:29:39,300 --> 02:29:40,767
Do you also pay this taX?

1147
02:29:42,567 --> 02:29:45,500
- Yes, Your Majesty!
- So why didn't you object?

1148
02:29:47,833 --> 02:29:52,300
This is outrageous.
A taX to offer prayers to God?

1149
02:29:53,233 --> 02:29:57,967
I never thought about it.
This taX has been collected for years.

1150
02:30:00,433 --> 02:30:02,300
How do we change this?

1151
02:30:22,967 --> 02:30:24,167
To all those present!

1152
02:30:25,300 --> 02:30:27,767
I want to make an important announcement -

1153
02:30:29,500 --> 02:30:33,300
After much deliberation,
I have come to realiZe...

1154
02:30:34,433 --> 02:30:37,900
...that asking Hindus to pay
a taX when they go on pilgrimage...

1155
02:30:38,967 --> 02:30:41,833
...is akin to weighing God's glory
in coins.

1156
02:30:44,033 --> 02:30:48,500
Therefore, I have decided that
from today...

1157
02:30:49,700 --> 02:30:52,500
...the Pilgrim TaX will be
abolished forever!

1158
02:30:56,833 --> 02:30:59,967
Your Majesty, it is
a wonderful thought.

1159
02:31:01,300 --> 02:31:04,767
May I be permitted to comment?

1160
02:31:06,033 --> 02:31:07,433
You may.

1161
02:31:07,767 --> 02:31:09,500
What is this injustice?

1162
02:31:11,767 --> 02:31:13,433
Have you forgotten us?

1163
02:31:14,967 --> 02:31:17,900
We, too, have worked hard
to build the Mughal Empire.

1164
02:31:19,433 --> 02:31:24,033
Our sweat has also cemented
the bricks to build the Empire.

1165
02:31:25,633 --> 02:31:31,500
We are also your advisors.
This is an astonishing decision!

1166
02:31:32,967 --> 02:31:35,833
Before deciding, why
wasn't our counsel taken?

1167
02:31:36,167 --> 02:31:39,300
I felt no need,
respected Saadir Adaasi!

1168
02:31:41,967 --> 02:31:48,167
Imposing or abolishing a taX is a
ruler's decision. The throne decides.

1169
02:31:50,167 --> 02:31:52,433
I'm not taking any step against lslam.

1170
02:31:53,700 --> 02:31:57,833
It is an administrative decision.
Not a religious one!

1171
02:31:59,167 --> 02:32:01,233
If that be so...

1172
02:32:02,900 --> 02:32:05,433
...then could the Finance Minister...

1173
02:32:06,967 --> 02:32:09,767
...Todarmalji kindly eXplain
the impact on the Royal Treasury?

1174
02:32:14,500 --> 02:32:18,433
Your Majesty, this decision will
definitely impact the Royal Treasury.

1175
02:32:18,967 --> 02:32:20,567
The Royal Treasury!

1176
02:32:22,633 --> 02:32:25,500
I'd like to know what
is this Royal Treasury?

1177
02:32:28,167 --> 02:32:29,633
What is this Treasury?

1178
02:32:31,433 --> 02:32:37,300
We, Mughals,
are not like the other invaders...

1179
02:32:38,233 --> 02:32:40,033
...who plunder and loot
Hindustan of its riches...

1180
02:32:41,700 --> 02:32:44,033
...and fill the coffers.

1181
02:32:46,167 --> 02:32:48,033
This is my country.

1182
02:32:48,967 --> 02:32:51,500
And I will not allow anyone
to ravage it!

1183
02:32:54,900 --> 02:32:56,967
I want my people to know...

1184
02:32:59,033 --> 02:33:03,167
...that regardless of their religion,
I will embrace them.

1185
02:33:05,500 --> 02:33:10,167
A coin rings out only when it falls,
not when picked up.

1186
02:33:11,167 --> 02:33:15,500
I request you not to be emotional
and make unwise decisions.

1187
02:33:20,167 --> 02:33:22,033
Ever since I was a child...

1188
02:33:23,767 --> 02:33:26,767
...others have made decisions for me.

1189
02:33:28,567 --> 02:33:31,433
I've always been told what must be done.

1190
02:33:33,033 --> 02:33:35,300
I want to be free now...

1191
02:33:37,767 --> 02:33:39,967
...and do as I see fit!

1192
02:33:45,033 --> 02:33:46,433
Todarmalji!

1193
02:33:47,033 --> 02:33:48,700
Let it be known...

1194
02:33:49,167 --> 02:33:52,967
...that from today,
the Pilgrim TaX is forever abolished!

1195
02:33:54,300 --> 02:33:56,967
Let the order be carried out!

1196
02:33:59,500 --> 02:34:01,300
Long live!

1197
02:34:21,967 --> 02:34:24,300
O great and magnificent Emperor

1198
02:34:26,700 --> 02:34:28,833
O great and magnificent Emperor

1199
02:34:29,233 --> 02:34:31,033
Ruler of Royal Decree

1200
02:34:31,567 --> 02:34:34,567
May your life be everlasting

1201
02:34:36,300 --> 02:34:40,967
Words alone cannot praise you
You are the cornerstone of Hindustan

1202
02:34:41,033 --> 02:34:45,433
Hindustan is your life
And you are the life of Hindustan

1203
02:34:45,967 --> 02:34:49,967
We welcome you in our hearts!

1204
02:34:55,167 --> 02:34:58,700
Kingdom of Virat's salutation!

1205
02:34:59,967 --> 02:35:01,967
O great and magnificent Emperor

1206
02:35:02,167 --> 02:35:04,233
Ruler of Royal Decree

1207
02:35:04,633 --> 02:35:08,900
May your life be everlasting

1208
02:35:09,233 --> 02:35:11,567
Words alone cannot praise you

1209
02:35:11,767 --> 02:35:13,967
You are the cornerstone of Hindustan

1210
02:35:14,033 --> 02:35:16,500
Hindustan is your life

1211
02:35:16,700 --> 02:35:18,500
And you are the life of Hindustan!

1212
02:35:18,700 --> 02:35:23,033
We welcome you in our hearts

1213
02:35:53,233 --> 02:35:56,433
The kingdom of
Shimalgarh's salutation!

1214
02:36:08,033 --> 02:36:10,033
In every town

1215
02:36:10,900 --> 02:36:12,033
In every courtyard

1216
02:36:12,900 --> 02:36:14,567
Love abounds

1217
02:36:15,300 --> 02:36:16,967
In every heart

1218
02:36:36,500 --> 02:36:38,167
Our victory...

1219
02:36:38,767 --> 02:36:40,700
... Iies in the Emperor

1220
02:36:41,167 --> 02:36:43,033
A wind of peace...

1221
02:36:43,567 --> 02:36:45,433
... blows across the land

1222
02:36:55,433 --> 02:36:59,700
We welcome you in our hearts

1223
02:37:04,633 --> 02:37:09,033
O great and magnificent Emperor
Ruler of Royal Decree

1224
02:37:11,767 --> 02:37:18,167
Empress of Hindustan,
jodhaabai has arrived in Diwaan-E-Aam!

1225
02:37:52,967 --> 02:37:56,433
I am overwhelmed with
happiness to see you here.

1226
02:37:57,167 --> 02:37:58,700
I had to come.

1227
02:37:59,567 --> 02:38:02,300
After all, you have won my heart!

1228
02:38:21,633 --> 02:38:22,767
Your Majesty...

1229
02:38:23,433 --> 02:38:27,300
...today your people have
wholly accepted you in their hearts.

1230
02:38:28,967 --> 02:38:32,433
And hence, your subjects, most humbly...

1231
02:38:32,967 --> 02:38:34,433
...wish to bestow on you...

1232
02:38:35,033 --> 02:38:36,967
...the title of... 'Akbar'!

1233
02:38:37,567 --> 02:38:40,033
jalaluddin Mohammad 'Akbar'!

1234
02:38:47,167 --> 02:38:49,633
The title pleases me very much.

1235
02:38:51,033 --> 02:38:53,767
I accept it with gratitude.

1236
02:38:55,167 --> 02:38:59,900
- jalaluddin Mohammad Akbar!
- Long live!

1237
02:39:00,233 --> 02:39:01,633
Akbar!

1238
02:39:02,567 --> 02:39:07,033
Every heart bears witness
to our Emperor's generosity

1239
02:39:07,433 --> 02:39:14,300
Wherever he treads,
he showers gold on his path

1240
02:39:23,700 --> 02:39:28,300
We welcome you in our hearts

1241
02:39:52,033 --> 02:39:55,500
Your religion is love

1242
02:39:56,767 --> 02:40:00,300
You rule many hearts

1243
02:40:10,900 --> 02:40:14,500
No praise can describe you

1244
02:40:15,633 --> 02:40:20,433
You are the confluence of all traditions

1245
02:40:34,633 --> 02:40:38,900
We welcome you in our hearts

1246
02:40:43,833 --> 02:40:46,167
O great and magnificent Emperor!

1247
02:42:31,633 --> 02:42:33,567
The Emperor has been struck by an arrow!

1248
02:42:37,500 --> 02:42:39,033
There he is!

1249
02:43:56,967 --> 02:44:01,900
Allow His Majesty to rest. We will
keep you informed of his progress.

1250
02:44:33,433 --> 02:44:36,700
'l am very pleased. No praise
will do justice to your work.'

1251
02:44:37,033 --> 02:44:39,767
'Delhi is within our reach now.
Saadir Adaasi'

1252
02:44:44,167 --> 02:44:48,167
The arrow's poison is spreading.

1253
02:44:49,500 --> 02:44:51,967
His temperature isn't coming down.

1254
02:45:05,900 --> 02:45:08,767
Who could have attempted
to kill jalaluddin?

1255
02:45:09,167 --> 02:45:13,967
- Never mind! My concern is Rajputana.
- Meaning?

1256
02:45:14,633 --> 02:45:17,567
If jalaluddin survives...

1257
02:45:18,767 --> 02:45:22,700
...the Mughal army will spare no one.

1258
02:45:23,900 --> 02:45:25,033
And if he dies...

1259
02:45:25,967 --> 02:45:29,433
...the Afghans and UZbeks
won't let this opportunity slip by.

1260
02:45:30,433 --> 02:45:32,300
That's so true, Ranaji.

1261
02:45:32,900 --> 02:45:35,433
It will be wise to ignore
the needs of others...

1262
02:45:35,833 --> 02:45:37,700
...and safeguard our own provinces.

1263
02:45:38,300 --> 02:45:39,633
Sujamal...

1264
02:45:40,967 --> 02:45:42,633
...we would've helped you...

1265
02:45:44,300 --> 02:45:46,300
...but circumstances have changed.

1266
02:45:47,700 --> 02:45:52,033
And anyway,
your struggle is no more political...

1267
02:45:52,433 --> 02:45:54,233
...it has become a family feud.

1268
02:45:56,033 --> 02:45:59,500
You must work alone to regain
your share of Amer's throne!

1269
02:46:00,700 --> 02:46:04,633
We can only offer you
our best wishes, nothing more!

1270
02:46:18,767 --> 02:46:21,233
jodhaa, his condition is worsening.

1271
02:46:35,300 --> 02:46:36,900
O Lord Krishna...

1272
02:47:07,300 --> 02:47:09,700
The Emperor has
regained consciousness!

1273
02:47:26,500 --> 02:47:28,300
May His Majesty live long!

1274
02:47:32,300 --> 02:47:34,433
May God give you a long life!

1275
02:47:34,967 --> 02:47:37,500
- Please rest.
- The Emperor is well again.

1276
02:47:37,833 --> 02:47:40,833
The Emperor is well again?
The Emperor is well again!

1277
02:47:47,700 --> 02:47:53,033
jalal, countless thanks to Allah
for giving you a new life.

1278
02:47:54,567 --> 02:47:55,567
Mother...

1279
02:47:56,500 --> 02:48:00,367
Don't strain, son. You need rest.

1280
02:48:36,100 --> 02:48:39,967
Turn the nib and draw a thicker line...

1281
02:48:50,700 --> 02:48:52,367
Why did you call me here?

1282
02:48:53,233 --> 02:48:55,500
I will show you why.
Disperse!

1283
02:48:56,967 --> 02:48:58,433
Please be seated.

1284
02:49:10,833 --> 02:49:12,700
I have made something special for you.

1285
02:49:13,500 --> 02:49:15,300
I'm learning calligraphy.

1286
02:49:15,700 --> 02:49:19,100
These are the first words
I have learnt to write.

1287
02:49:21,033 --> 02:49:24,500
Allah be praised. It is beautiful!

1288
02:49:27,500 --> 02:49:29,967
This calligraphy... this writing...

1289
02:49:31,167 --> 02:49:33,767
...whatever is written, is beautiful.

1290
02:49:35,700 --> 02:49:39,433
Since its your writing,
why don't you read it aloud.

1291
02:49:40,233 --> 02:49:42,700
No, you must read it yourself.

1292
02:49:48,300 --> 02:49:50,433
There's something
you must know, jodhaa.

1293
02:49:52,500 --> 02:49:54,167
The truth is...

1294
02:49:55,500 --> 02:49:57,567
...I cannot read or write!

1295
02:49:59,500 --> 02:50:05,167
The battlefield never allowed me
to learn, how to read or write.

1296
02:50:08,967 --> 02:50:10,367
So now will you read it?

1297
02:50:14,567 --> 02:50:16,300
You won't agree this way.

1298
02:50:19,967 --> 02:50:21,300
It's an order!

1299
02:50:24,300 --> 02:50:25,167
Read it!

1300
02:50:26,033 --> 02:50:28,700
A wife does not take
her husband's name.

1301
02:50:35,700 --> 02:50:37,300
Look into my eyes and say it.

1302
02:50:42,700 --> 02:50:49,767
jalaluddin Mohammed Akbar.

1303
02:50:54,233 --> 02:50:55,767
"Jodhaa" ...

1304
02:50:58,433 --> 02:51:00,100
I want to ask you something...

1305
02:51:01,833 --> 02:51:03,100
Please do...

1306
02:51:04,300 --> 02:51:07,833
Not here. Come with me.

1307
02:51:34,033 --> 02:51:36,700
What was it that you wanted to ask?

1308
02:51:38,567 --> 02:51:40,700
I am waiting for the right moment...

1309
02:52:07,233 --> 02:52:08,967
Do you love me?

1310
02:52:22,500 --> 02:52:24,033
Yes, I do.

1311
02:52:24,967 --> 02:52:26,367
And you?

1312
02:52:27,567 --> 02:52:29,967
I love you deeply!

1313
02:52:39,700 --> 02:52:43,700
In the folds of these moments

1314
02:52:46,167 --> 02:52:50,700
Is a relationship so pure

1315
02:52:52,500 --> 02:53:00,033
Like a prayer of
love the angels recite

1316
02:53:02,100 --> 02:53:07,033
The earth is silent
The sky is perpleXed

1317
02:53:08,700 --> 02:53:13,700
There is light shining from earth to sky

1318
02:53:17,500 --> 02:53:25,033
Songs fill the stillness.
There is beauty in your every gesture

1319
02:53:25,700 --> 02:53:30,033
There is love floating in the air

1320
02:54:23,700 --> 02:54:26,500
What love is this?

1321
02:54:27,033 --> 02:54:29,033
What dream is this?

1322
02:54:30,433 --> 02:54:36,300
What flood of feeling is this?

1323
02:54:49,567 --> 02:54:58,833
The days have changed. And nights
too. The meaning of life has changed

1324
02:55:00,567 --> 02:55:06,033
In the folds of these moments...

1325
02:55:39,033 --> 02:55:46,300
What has time done to me?
Changed my very being

1326
02:55:48,700 --> 02:55:55,967
You have won me I found you

1327
02:55:58,300 --> 02:56:04,167
Melting like two gentle melodies

1328
02:56:04,567 --> 02:56:10,567
A rhythm, not slow, not fast

1329
02:56:11,033 --> 02:56:13,567
In the flame of fire

1330
02:56:13,833 --> 02:56:22,833
Our bodies and souls
burn in the flame of love

1331
02:56:42,700 --> 02:56:48,433
In my garden of dreams

1332
02:56:50,167 --> 02:56:56,967
Spring came only because of you

1333
02:56:58,167 --> 02:57:04,567
The flowers had my colours

1334
02:57:05,700 --> 02:57:13,700
But their fragrance has come from you

1335
02:57:16,500 --> 02:57:22,567
What desire and emotion is this?

1336
02:57:23,300 --> 02:57:28,767
Why is the heart so restless?
Why is the heart so impatient?

1337
02:57:42,500 --> 02:57:51,500
The days have changed. And nights
too. The meaning of life has changed

1338
02:57:53,500 --> 02:57:58,233
In the folds of these moments...

1339
02:58:44,700 --> 02:58:49,567
We missed our last chance.
That incompetent marksman!

1340
02:58:51,167 --> 02:58:55,500
- You mean?
- Yes! It was l, who sent the assassin.

1341
02:58:56,700 --> 02:58:59,433
Be gone! Our efforts have gone waste.

1342
02:59:01,433 --> 02:59:03,767
I'm glad my sister is not widowed.

1343
02:59:04,433 --> 02:59:08,567
Sujamal! What's with you? You don't
even know whose side you are on.

1344
02:59:09,567 --> 02:59:10,967
Greed has blinded you!

1345
02:59:11,567 --> 02:59:15,767
I want my rightful share of Amer!
You don't know which side to take!

1346
02:59:16,833 --> 02:59:19,300
The Emperor is your brother-in-law,
Sharifuddin Hussain.

1347
02:59:19,833 --> 02:59:22,833
Personal relations cannot
interfere with my goals.

1348
02:59:24,033 --> 02:59:26,833
You will soon discover
I am on your side...

1349
02:59:27,967 --> 02:59:30,233
...I want to see you
on Amer's throne...

1350
02:59:31,300 --> 02:59:35,700
...and you will see me
on Delhi's throne. Our pact is firm!

1351
02:59:36,967 --> 02:59:39,300
We have only one option now.

1352
02:59:40,033 --> 02:59:44,033
Attack Amer at once!
We won't get a better opportunity.

1353
02:59:46,833 --> 02:59:48,300
Are you with me?

1354
02:59:54,033 --> 02:59:55,033
Yes.

1355
03:00:00,833 --> 03:00:02,300
Sharifuddin Hussain!

1356
03:00:16,967 --> 03:00:19,967
jalal knows you were behind
the assassination attempt.

1357
03:00:20,500 --> 03:00:25,167
He is furious.
Soldiers are coming for us!

1358
03:00:26,367 --> 03:00:28,300
Have no fear, Saadir Adaasi Sahib.

1359
03:00:29,567 --> 03:00:32,833
Before Agra, we must seiZe Amer!

1360
03:00:33,300 --> 03:00:34,500
Amer?

1361
03:00:36,033 --> 03:00:38,833
Will Sujamal help you once he is crowned?

1362
03:00:40,833 --> 03:00:44,967
Once Amer is in our hands,
we will finish Sujamal.

1363
03:00:49,500 --> 03:00:52,567
Sharifuddin has planned
an attack on Amer.

1364
03:00:53,167 --> 03:00:55,300
With Sujamal taking on his side.

1365
03:00:56,433 --> 03:01:00,233
End this conflict and
give Sujamal his rightful share.

1366
03:01:03,233 --> 03:01:04,700
Have no fear!

1367
03:01:05,500 --> 03:01:06,433
Yes.

1368
03:01:09,500 --> 03:01:10,967
Now about Sharifuddin...

1369
03:01:13,700 --> 03:01:17,700
...he must be stopped in Merta,
before he reaches Amer.

1370
03:01:42,833 --> 03:01:43,833
Banu?

1371
03:01:44,033 --> 03:01:48,500
Time is scarce.
My husband can kill Sujamal anytime.

1372
03:01:50,567 --> 03:01:53,700
jodhaa, stop this battle!

1373
03:01:54,500 --> 03:01:57,700
Or else three families
will drown in their own blood.

1374
03:02:00,700 --> 03:02:02,233
We have to go!

1375
03:02:03,567 --> 03:02:06,500
The battlefield is dangerous.
Do not go!

1376
03:02:10,033 --> 03:02:15,367
Todarmalji, my mind is made up.
I must go. Do not worry.

1377
03:02:23,033 --> 03:02:23,967
Halt!

1378
03:02:40,767 --> 03:02:45,033
Your Majesty, dust is rising
on the northern horiZon...

1379
03:03:02,700 --> 03:03:04,033
How far are they?

1380
03:03:05,300 --> 03:03:07,367
About three miles.

1381
03:03:12,300 --> 03:03:14,967
Two miles...

1382
03:03:18,300 --> 03:03:20,700
He has arrived too soon.

1383
03:03:24,233 --> 03:03:26,833
One mile!

1384
03:03:34,700 --> 03:03:36,233
Halt!

1385
03:03:58,967 --> 03:04:02,967
Your Majesty,
the archers await your command.

1386
03:04:04,300 --> 03:04:05,367
No!

1387
03:04:07,500 --> 03:04:09,167
I want peace, not war.

1388
03:04:10,500 --> 03:04:13,967
Chughtai Khan! Raise the peace flag!

1389
03:04:16,567 --> 03:04:18,233
Pardon me, Your Majesty...

1390
03:04:18,433 --> 03:04:21,833
...Sharifuddin will misunderstand.
He might assume we are weak.

1391
03:04:23,100 --> 03:04:24,967
That's precisely what I want.

1392
03:04:25,567 --> 03:04:28,700
He must get the wrong idea
and commit a mistake.

1393
03:04:29,567 --> 03:04:31,833
I understood. Raise the peace flag!

1394
03:04:41,967 --> 03:04:45,567
I knew jalaluddin
would want to negotiate.

1395
03:04:46,367 --> 03:04:47,967
- Manjum Khan!
- Yes, Your Majesty.

1396
03:04:48,433 --> 03:04:50,833
Raise our flag in acceptance.

1397
03:04:52,300 --> 03:04:55,433
And set camp here!

1398
03:04:56,433 --> 03:04:58,300
Allah, protect us!

1399
03:05:10,700 --> 03:05:12,500
He deliberately did
not use elephants.

1400
03:05:12,833 --> 03:05:14,833
Because they would
have slowed down his pace.

1401
03:05:15,033 --> 03:05:19,033
Their army has much food.
They can survive a long time.

1402
03:05:19,567 --> 03:05:21,967
They can eXtend the battle
longer than us.

1403
03:05:26,433 --> 03:05:30,100
Many of our soldiers have been
misguided to join Sharifuddin's army.

1404
03:05:32,167 --> 03:05:34,033
We have to bring them back!

1405
03:05:35,967 --> 03:05:40,500
A great battle is won
without shedding a single drop of blood.

1406
03:06:06,033 --> 03:06:07,833
- Is everything ready?
- Yes, Your Majesty.

1407
03:06:08,300 --> 03:06:09,567
Make no mistake.

1408
03:06:10,300 --> 03:06:14,700
You will infiltrate the Emperor's
army and find a way into his tent...

1409
03:06:15,833 --> 03:06:19,833
...and at the opportune moment,
kill the Emperor!

1410
03:06:21,567 --> 03:06:23,767
Also, jalaluddin has told Bharmal...

1411
03:06:24,433 --> 03:06:27,967
...to grant Sujamal
his rights to Amer's throne.

1412
03:06:28,500 --> 03:06:31,567
Make sure Sujamal
learns nothing of this.

1413
03:06:33,500 --> 03:06:37,967
Once we get rid of the Emperor,
Sujamal comes neXt.

1414
03:06:47,233 --> 03:06:48,300
Don't ask questions!

1415
03:06:50,233 --> 03:06:51,967
We are withdrawing
our support of Sharifuddin.

1416
03:06:52,367 --> 03:06:53,500
As you command.

1417
03:06:56,167 --> 03:06:59,967
Take our men and fight alongside
jalaluddin's army.

1418
03:07:01,100 --> 03:07:02,567
Hurry! There is very little time.

1419
03:07:02,833 --> 03:07:04,367
As you command...

1420
03:07:15,100 --> 03:07:16,767
What is the meaning of this?

1421
03:07:20,100 --> 03:07:24,500
- Kumbhaa?
- What happened? Surprised?

1422
03:07:26,367 --> 03:07:30,100
Wasn't he the one you sent to warn jalaluddin?

1423
03:07:30,567 --> 03:07:33,167
Yes. Because I wanted to stop you.

1424
03:07:34,233 --> 03:07:38,100
If you're a true warrior, then fight
jalaluddin on the battlefield.

1425
03:07:38,967 --> 03:07:40,167
Not by conspiracy!

1426
03:07:40,700 --> 03:07:41,833
Not by conspiracy?

1427
03:07:43,500 --> 03:07:46,033
When you asked me
to help overthrow King Bharmal...

1428
03:07:46,500 --> 03:07:47,700
...wasn't that a conspiracy?

1429
03:07:49,100 --> 03:07:50,300
Where was your loyalty then?

1430
03:09:05,967 --> 03:09:08,167
On your guard!

1431
03:09:10,300 --> 03:09:11,567
Horsemen approaching!

1432
03:09:14,500 --> 03:09:15,833
It's Sujamal!

1433
03:09:22,167 --> 03:09:23,300
Sujamal!

1434
03:09:44,033 --> 03:09:45,033
Warn the Emperor!

1435
03:09:45,500 --> 03:09:48,433
Bhagwan Das, pull out the arrows!

1436
03:10:07,967 --> 03:10:08,967
Is this Sujamal?

1437
03:10:10,033 --> 03:10:11,100
Yes, Your Majesty.

1438
03:10:15,967 --> 03:10:21,500
Sharifuddin has sent an assassin
disguised as a Royal Guard to kill you.

1439
03:10:28,967 --> 03:10:30,033
Take him away!

1440
03:10:43,300 --> 03:10:45,567
Thank you, Uncle. I am grateful to you.

1441
03:10:46,500 --> 03:10:48,433
You agreed to offer me my share...

1442
03:10:50,300 --> 03:10:55,100
I made a mistake... in judging you

1443
03:10:58,700 --> 03:10:59,700
O Allah!

1444
03:11:02,100 --> 03:11:03,700
jodhaa will be distraught!

1445
03:11:04,100 --> 03:11:06,033
She betrayed me!

1446
03:11:07,700 --> 03:11:09,700
No, Sujamal. You are mistaken.

1447
03:11:10,833 --> 03:11:13,833
It was l, who mistrusted her,
and wanted you arrested.

1448
03:11:14,767 --> 03:11:17,300
- jodhaa is not at fault.
- What?

1449
03:11:54,833 --> 03:12:00,833
jodhaa, I misunderstood you
and doubted your integrity...

1450
03:12:06,300 --> 03:12:07,767
...forgive me...

1451
03:12:10,033 --> 03:12:11,300
Don't say that!

1452
03:12:12,233 --> 03:12:13,967
I misunderstood you...

1453
03:12:16,033 --> 03:12:18,233
...I hurt your honour...

1454
03:12:22,300 --> 03:12:23,700
No, brother!

1455
03:12:29,500 --> 03:12:31,700
May you stay forever happy!

1456
03:12:40,300 --> 03:12:43,100
You are... a great man!

1457
03:12:44,367 --> 03:12:48,300
I was wrong...
to have not understood you.

1458
03:12:49,300 --> 03:12:51,500
What you have done for jodhaa...

1459
03:12:52,033 --> 03:12:59,767
...will make future generations
honour and respect you...

1460
03:13:29,567 --> 03:13:30,500
Banu...

1461
03:13:31,833 --> 03:13:33,500
...Sharifuddin is a rebel.

1462
03:13:36,300 --> 03:13:39,700
He has committed treason against me.

1463
03:13:42,033 --> 03:13:46,767
The only punishment
for such a man is death.

1464
03:13:49,033 --> 03:13:51,033
justice demands that I kill him.

1465
03:13:51,700 --> 03:13:55,233
I don't know if he is right or wrong.

1466
03:13:56,500 --> 03:13:59,433
But the need of the hour is...

1467
03:14:00,733 --> 03:14:03,833
...to let your spirit of forgiveness
guide your decision.

1468
03:14:05,300 --> 03:14:08,833
O Allah, what must I do?

1469
03:14:10,733 --> 03:14:13,133
First Adham and now Sharifuddin...

1470
03:14:15,133 --> 03:14:20,533
...why do my close ones have
to fall under the shadow of my sword?

1471
03:14:40,667 --> 03:14:42,533
I eXpected this behaviour from you...

1472
03:14:43,467 --> 03:14:46,067
...but it is your misfortune
that I survived.

1473
03:14:47,033 --> 03:14:50,033
I could have made you Governor
of other provinces besides Ajmer.

1474
03:14:51,733 --> 03:14:55,933
Rebellion results in only one thing...
and that is bloodshed.

1475
03:14:56,433 --> 03:15:01,033
Didn't you think of 'bloodshed'
when you mercilessly killed Adham Khan?

1476
03:15:01,433 --> 03:15:03,133
That was a different matter,
Sharifuddin.

1477
03:15:03,833 --> 03:15:05,000
How unfair!

1478
03:15:05,667 --> 03:15:09,733
You can't state the 'rules of the game'
and make the moves too.

1479
03:15:10,933 --> 03:15:13,267
This time I decide the rules.

1480
03:15:15,467 --> 03:15:16,267
I am listening.

1481
03:15:16,667 --> 03:15:20,467
If you want, we can prevent bloodshed.

1482
03:15:22,000 --> 03:15:22,933
And how is that?

1483
03:15:23,533 --> 03:15:25,467
Fight me!

1484
03:15:26,933 --> 03:15:29,000
In an arm-to-arm combat.

1485
03:15:30,467 --> 03:15:32,933
If I win,
then Hindustan will be mine.

1486
03:15:36,067 --> 03:15:40,533
And if I lose,
I will leave this country forever!

1487
03:15:45,467 --> 03:15:47,000
I accept!

1488
03:15:50,800 --> 03:15:55,467
This is no way to crush a revolt.
Why did you accept?

1489
03:15:56,467 --> 03:15:58,267
To prevent bloodshed.

1490
03:15:58,733 --> 03:16:04,200
Forgive me, Your Majesty, you forget
Sharifuddin is fierce and vicious.

1491
03:16:05,133 --> 03:16:06,467
I'm aware of that.

1492
03:16:08,200 --> 03:16:09,533
He is a strong man.

1493
03:16:11,133 --> 03:16:14,067
But I won't let Hindustan
fall in the wrong hands!

1494
03:21:54,467 --> 03:21:56,000
Sharifuddin!

1495
03:21:59,000 --> 03:22:01,667
If you were not my brother-in-law...

1496
03:22:03,067 --> 03:22:05,267
...this spear would
have gone through you!

1497
03:22:10,333 --> 03:22:12,467
Only for my sister's sake...

1498
03:22:13,800 --> 03:22:15,467
...I forgive you!

1499
03:22:28,667 --> 03:22:31,267
I am taking back
your provinces from you.

1500
03:22:36,267 --> 03:22:39,667
You will not be allowed to take any
administrative decisions from now on.

1501
03:22:40,667 --> 03:22:42,067
As you command.

1502
03:22:44,933 --> 03:22:50,000
And all your life...
you will remain loyal to me!

1503
03:22:52,133 --> 03:22:53,267
Yes, Your Majesty!

1504
03:22:56,133 --> 03:23:02,800
- Emperor jalaluddin Mohammad Akbar!
- Long live!

1505
03:23:36,933 --> 03:23:39,333
Respected Saadir Adaasi Sahib...

1506
03:23:41,000 --> 03:23:43,067
...the happiness of life...

1507
03:23:44,467 --> 03:23:47,333
...cannot be divided
on religious grounds.

1508
03:23:54,267 --> 03:23:57,467
I am a follower of lslam... a Muslim!

1509
03:23:59,067 --> 03:24:02,667
And yet, I bow my head,
in respect for every religion.

1510
03:24:05,733 --> 03:24:08,200
The people of my Empire are free...

1511
03:24:09,733 --> 03:24:12,133
...to worship and practice
their religions.

1512
03:24:15,933 --> 03:24:20,733
But it is a shame
you failed to understand me.

1513
03:24:24,400 --> 03:24:26,267
Now it is my wish.

1514
03:24:28,200 --> 03:24:33,200
You dedicate your life to
Allah and travel to Holy Mecca!

1515
03:24:53,933 --> 03:24:56,800
Now I request
the Rajput Empress of Hindustan...

1516
03:24:57,400 --> 03:24:59,400
...to join me here.

1517
03:25:07,533 --> 03:25:11,333
To all present and the Mughal empire,
I say this for the last time -

1518
03:25:13,667 --> 03:25:15,800
Queen jodhaa is a Hindu Rajput.

1519
03:25:17,533 --> 03:25:19,000
She is my wife.

1520
03:25:19,933 --> 03:25:22,400
And the Empress of Hindustan!

1521
03:25:23,667 --> 03:25:27,267
Any act against her, is an act
against the Mughal empire.

1522
03:25:30,667 --> 03:25:33,000
Let one more thing
be known to one and all!

1523
03:25:34,133 --> 03:25:39,200
Respect and tolerance
of every religion...

1524
03:25:40,267 --> 03:25:42,933
...will make the future
of Hindustan glorious!

1525
03:25:43,733 --> 03:25:45,800
So be it!

1526
03:25:50,267 --> 03:25:51,800
Anything else for the day,
Chughtai Khan?

1527
03:25:52,467 --> 03:25:54,533
Only a prayer for your good health.

1528
03:25:57,933 --> 03:26:00,333
This was the story of jodhaa Akbar.

1529
03:26:02,200 --> 03:26:04,667
Their love story is
not a part of folklore.

1530
03:26:05,733 --> 03:26:08,000
Nor is their love ever discussed.

1531
03:26:09,533 --> 03:26:13,667
Perhaps, it is because...
history never gave them any importance.

1532
03:26:14,667 --> 03:26:16,533
But the truth is...

1533
03:26:17,000 --> 03:26:20,000
... that jodhaa and Akbar, together...

1534
03:26:20,467 --> 03:26:21,667
... silently...

1535
03:26:22,200 --> 03:26:24,667
... made history!

1536
03:26:40,000 --> 03:26:50,000
