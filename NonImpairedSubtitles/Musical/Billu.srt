00:03:30,877 --> 00:03:34,040
Government Officer Mr. Laghu Duo,

l'm Vilas Pardesi aka Billu.
Village Budbudha,

00:03:38,751 --> 00:03:41,242
Lala Lajpal has visited here,

4
00:03:42,121 --> 00:03:43,383
Have you seen my Billu Saloon,

5
00:03:44,324 --> 00:03:47,225
and if you seen then it's good,
because l'm writing this letter on

condition is same as your government,

7

somethings,

8
00:04:00,073 --> 00:04:03,600
like a chair what my naughty children
calls Swinger,

9
00:04:03,876 --> 00:04:07,039
some day it will be break and it will
break customer's butt,

10
00:04:07,547 --> 00:04:10,812
a scissor who never cuts anyone,

11
00:04:11,084 --> 00:04:14,611
A comb who looks like an old man jaw,

12
00:04:14,754 --> 00:04:16,619
it's one teeth is here and one is
there,

13
00:04:17,223 --> 00:04:20,886
So l am requesting you for loan to
purchase new accessories,

14
00:04:21,327 --> 00:04:24,319
l'm sure you will think that why l'm
directly not talking to you.

15
00:04:25,198 --> 00:04:28,895
l came here, and l'm counting bees
sitting outside on broken bench,

16
00:04:30,136 --> 00:04:33,503
But l've heard government files doesn't
move without weight,

17
00:04:33,840 --> 00:04:36,400
And l don't have any idea about bribe.

18
00:04:36,876 --> 00:04:39,777
And l don't want to mess it all,

19
00:04:39,946 --> 00:04:43,507
that's why l am asking you in written,

20
00:04:43,850 --> 00:04:45,340

21
00:04:45,752 --> 00:04:47,686
lf your answer is yes then l'll tell

22
00:04:48,154 --> 00:04:51,783
And if your answer is no, then you

23
00:04:52,058 --> 00:04:54,891
Your upcoming customer,
Billu.

24
00:04:58,197 --> 00:05:00,358
An idiot is sitting outside,
Send him inside,

25
00:05:04,070 --> 00:05:04,661
Greetings! Team DUS Jay78

26
00:05:04,937 --> 00:05:08,031
May l come in?
Please come,

27
00:05:08,508 --> 00:05:11,068
Mr. Gandhi,
Mr. Dharam Raj,

28
00:05:11,244 --> 00:05:13,678
How could they come,
they are gone, they are died,

29
00:05:13,813 --> 00:05:17,476
l came alone,
that's why l am respecting you,

30
00:05:17,617 --> 00:05:18,948
All those great souls are gone,

31
00:05:19,118 --> 00:05:22,212
But it's my pleasure to meet you,

32
00:05:22,355 --> 00:05:24,789
Directly ask to Government Officer,

33
00:05:24,957 --> 00:05:26,447
that will you take bribe or not,

34
00:05:26,626 --> 00:05:28,457
Amazing!

35
00:05:28,628 --> 00:05:32,997
A man of principles like you is
eligible for praise not for loan,

36
00:05:33,766 --> 00:05:37,429
No, lf that bribe line hurts your
feelings,

37
00:05:37,603 --> 00:05:40,572
then l'll cut that line,
Abuse is like a children's ball,

38
00:05:40,740 --> 00:05:43,766
that you through it on the wall and
catch it back,

39
00:05:43,910 --> 00:05:46,140
Go you great soul,

40
00:05:46,312 --> 00:05:48,143
You won't get any loan,

41
00:05:48,314 --> 00:05:50,782
Pandit Jee, something for that
rolling chair,

42
00:05:50,950 --> 00:05:53,441
You will always wander,

43
00:05:53,586 --> 00:05:55,577
but you won't get loan,

44
00:05:56,289 --> 00:05:58,450
Thanks!
for what?

45
00:05:58,624 --> 00:05:59,522
You should never ask straight to
any government officer

46
00:05:59,692 --> 00:06:03,253
will you take a bribe,

47
00:06:03,596 --> 00:06:05,894
You have teach me this lesson,
Out!

48
00:06:07,033 --> 00:06:07,965
Out!

49
00:06:14,807 --> 00:06:17,367
Why you people are sitting outside,
Electricity is not coming or what.

50
00:06:17,643 --> 00:06:20,874
That's why we put the lamp, electricity
department have cut our electricity,

51
00:06:21,147 --> 00:06:22,876
Okay,
No problem, it's a good thing,

52
00:06:23,015 --> 00:06:26,212
Big people like Mahatma Gandhi,

53
00:06:26,352 --> 00:06:28,650
were study in lamp light all night,

54
00:06:29,021 --> 00:06:30,318
so what they did in days,

55
00:06:31,090 --> 00:06:32,421
They went to school,

56
00:06:32,558 --> 00:06:35,391
They helped their parents for work,

57
00:06:35,628 --> 00:06:39,189
Yes, even Mr. Abraham Linkon studied
in street lamps,

58
00:06:39,365 --> 00:06:41,265
From tomorrow l'll go to street,

59
00:06:41,434 --> 00:06:44,699
You don't understand anything,

60
00:06:46,706 --> 00:06:48,833
Where is your mom,
She is gone to get some oil.

61
00:06:48,975 --> 00:06:50,966
Naughty, you're talking about your
mom,

62
00:06:51,144 --> 00:06:53,078
She is really gone for get oil,

63
00:06:53,613 --> 00:06:56,241
To our neighbour Mina Mosi,

64
00:07:01,521 --> 00:07:02,852
You didn't brought the grains,

65
00:07:03,689 --> 00:07:08,023
No, l came out from shop but entire
market was closed,

66
00:07:08,428 --> 00:07:11,192
Tell the truth, nobody has come for
hair cut,

67
00:07:11,364 --> 00:07:12,763
No,
l had some customers,

68
00:07:12,932 --> 00:07:14,957
l paid our house rent,
Now happy,

69
00:07:15,301 --> 00:07:16,063
Very happy,

70
00:07:16,702 --> 00:07:19,933
Now give him another good news,
Which one,

71
00:07:20,440 --> 00:07:23,534
Principle has called you school
tomorrow,

72
00:07:23,709 --> 00:07:25,301
Why?
lt's a good news,

73
00:07:39,258 --> 00:07:39,917
Greetings,

74
00:07:41,260 --> 00:07:42,750
Bindya was saying that if today....

75
00:07:42,895 --> 00:07:45,591
fees won't be submit then you will
restigate them,

76
00:07:46,032 --> 00:07:48,557
Out, office is outside,
go and submit your fees outside,

77
00:07:50,903 --> 00:07:52,302
l couldn't bring the money,

78
00:07:54,841 --> 00:07:55,933
Have you brought your memory,

79
00:07:56,809 --> 00:08:00,711
Look, last time you beg to me that's
why l made you a promise,

80
00:08:00,880 --> 00:08:02,541
Today l fulfill that promise,

81
00:08:03,249 --> 00:08:06,650
One month's fee hasn't come that's
why l restigate your childrens,

82
00:08:08,654 --> 00:08:10,053
But how it worth?

83
00:08:10,356 --> 00:08:12,790
We will see what it worths?

84
00:08:14,327 --> 00:08:17,694
Sister, if you will restigate children
from school then there will be 2 things

85
00:08:17,930 --> 00:08:19,625
First, your school fee will be stuck,

86
00:08:19,799 --> 00:08:21,562
because how money will come to me,

87
00:08:21,868 --> 00:08:23,927
Second, children's studies will be
stuck.

88
00:08:25,137 --> 00:08:27,833
You can save one thing to stuck
between both of them,

89
00:08:28,107 --> 00:08:29,904
Which one?
Studies.

90
00:08:30,810 --> 00:08:31,606
What?

91
00:08:32,178 --> 00:08:34,544
l swear, l have broke my all piggy
banks,

92
00:08:34,680 --> 00:08:36,614
look, l've got one rupee,

93
00:08:37,383 --> 00:08:39,647
Now when l went to sell my goat then
my wife shouts,

94
00:08:39,785 --> 00:08:42,219
then let your childrens teach from
goat,

95
00:08:43,789 --> 00:08:45,256
Shall l send my goat here,

96
00:08:45,491 --> 00:08:48,688
First you will teach my goat and then
goat will teach my childrens,

97
00:08:49,095 --> 00:08:50,562
Then you will ask goat's fee,

98
00:08:50,730 --> 00:08:53,494
You're making me fool,
Who started that?

99
00:08:54,033 --> 00:08:56,263
Get out from here,

100
00:09:03,009 --> 00:09:05,739
You were walking with heavy feets
in school.

101
00:09:05,878 --> 00:09:08,142
like you have a lot of money in your
pocket,

102
00:09:08,314 --> 00:09:10,544
and you will pay our school fees,

103
00:09:10,683 --> 00:09:14,244
But l told you l'll arrange soon,

104
00:09:14,387 --> 00:09:18,346
l am happy, l don't have to listen
your same speech daily,

105
00:09:18,491 --> 00:09:20,391
Bring first number,

106
00:09:20,660 --> 00:09:22,628
But l buy you all the books,

107
00:09:23,029 --> 00:09:25,623
What if they take you out from school,
Learn outside from the window,

108
00:09:26,065 --> 00:09:28,329
Then what is the need to come school.

109
00:09:28,467 --> 00:09:29,900
We can study at home,

110
00:09:30,970 --> 00:09:33,996
To wash same uniform mom's back
won't pain,

111
00:09:34,340 --> 00:09:36,638
But you have to go school for exams,

112
00:09:57,730 --> 00:10:00,858
Why you came to my shop every
morning,

113
00:10:02,668 --> 00:10:05,967
Listen what happened today this
dharmendra has lost today,

114
00:10:06,105 --> 00:10:07,663
He will give me a crore,

115
00:10:08,708 --> 00:10:10,369
What?
Whose hand he will turn?

116
00:10:10,710 --> 00:10:12,803
Not turn, idiot crore,

117
00:10:12,979 --> 00:10:15,846
lt's one crore,

118
00:10:16,248 --> 00:10:19,911
These losers are playing of crores on
street and don't have a single penny,

119
00:10:20,086 --> 00:10:23,214
But it satisfies our selves,
You watch your empty safe all day long

120
00:10:23,356 --> 00:10:27,383
That's why you are always upset,
Can't you find another place for play,

121
00:10:27,560 --> 00:10:31,018
Where we will find a batter place than
that, nobody comes here,

122
00:10:39,839 --> 00:10:41,670
This peace is embarassing for me,

123
00:10:42,208 --> 00:10:45,541
Today l have oil then shine your self,
But from tomorrow, no oil for you,

124
00:10:45,678 --> 00:10:48,169
and there is no guarantee from
tomorrow,

125
00:10:48,314 --> 00:10:50,782
And this is the last trick, after
that you hold my ship.

126
00:10:51,817 --> 00:10:53,409
How ship will reach to corner,

127
00:10:53,786 --> 00:10:57,051
This Modern Madan is a problem here,

128
00:10:57,523 --> 00:10:59,388
Since Modern Madan's shop has open,

129
00:10:59,558 --> 00:11:01,526
Billu's scissors are stopped,

130
00:11:01,861 --> 00:11:04,329
Nowadays, it's a trend of exposure,

131
00:11:04,497 --> 00:11:07,591
Madan has made his shop like
Rakhi Sawant,

132
00:11:08,701 --> 00:11:10,601
And his shop is like old Neerupa Rai,

133
00:11:11,637 --> 00:11:15,664
All budbude's hair has cut in that
saloon,

134
00:11:15,808 --> 00:11:17,537
Do something, Billu Bhai.

135
00:11:21,047 --> 00:11:21,638
Pagla (Mad)

136
00:11:23,549 --> 00:11:25,642
Hey!
Hold your tongue,

137
00:11:26,085 --> 00:11:27,575
l said next,

138
00:11:28,254 --> 00:11:31,553
l have many customers here, l don't
have time for waste,

139
00:11:32,224 --> 00:11:32,918
Next!

140
00:11:38,931 --> 00:11:39,795
Hey!
Look!

141
00:11:48,574 --> 00:11:50,439
Old Rate, New Rate.

142
00:11:51,877 --> 00:11:54,141
Cutting rate from fifteen rupees to
ten rupees,

143
00:11:54,313 --> 00:11:56,611
What is this billu's next trick?

144
00:11:56,949 --> 00:11:59,383
Don't know it is the cheap price of
billu,

145
00:11:59,552 --> 00:12:01,349
or nothing,

146
00:12:07,426 --> 00:12:09,724
Shut the engine,
Petrol is very expensive,

147
00:12:10,763 --> 00:12:15,393
Then totally it is 2750,

148
00:12:15,868 --> 00:12:17,859
What he is doing here?
Call him up here,

149
00:12:18,003 --> 00:12:20,028
Hey, Billu!
come here.

150
00:12:20,473 --> 00:12:22,168
Mr. Dumchand is calling you.

151
00:12:22,775 --> 00:12:24,868
How many times l told you damchand,

152
00:12:26,746 --> 00:12:29,579
don't you understand once,
What should l do?

153
00:12:30,149 --> 00:12:32,845
l didn't kept your name that's why....

154
00:12:33,018 --> 00:12:37,751
from today write daily for 101 times,
damchand, damchand, damchand,

155
00:12:38,090 --> 00:12:41,025
and still you can't call, then don't
come on work from tomorrow,

156
00:12:41,293 --> 00:12:42,726
Greetings!
greetings!

157
00:12:43,863 --> 00:12:46,832
Your saloon has closed now you will
cut wood on my body,

158
00:12:48,267 --> 00:12:51,259
l needed a new chair that's why....
Oh! your time has changed,

159
00:12:51,570 --> 00:12:53,401
Your busniess is running good,
Where?

160
00:12:54,140 --> 00:12:55,971
But planning is necessary in life,

161
00:12:56,108 --> 00:12:59,077
that's why l understand the estimate
of chair,

162
00:12:59,411 --> 00:13:02,346
From today l will save my money
then l will order,

163
00:13:02,681 --> 00:13:05,172
So, you don't need a chair and you
don't have money,

164
00:13:05,351 --> 00:13:07,376
No, l don't need it right now,

165
00:13:07,520 --> 00:13:11,854
l don't have money,

166
00:13:11,991 --> 00:13:14,824
Then why did you break my legs,

167
00:13:17,463 --> 00:13:19,488
Do you think l am a fool?

168
00:13:21,200 --> 00:13:23,395
Billu!
lt's a matter of timing,

169
00:13:24,336 --> 00:13:26,998
Those people's business is running
good,

170
00:13:27,173 --> 00:13:30,574
they all took money on interest from
me, but you didn't...

171
00:13:30,943 --> 00:13:32,467
that's why your business is not
running.

172
00:13:32,645 --> 00:13:34,169
Look, don't worry,

173
00:13:34,313 --> 00:13:36,076
Get some cash and forget the timing,

174
00:13:36,649 --> 00:13:37,707
Just give me interest.

175
00:13:38,017 --> 00:13:40,212
lf l ain't get yet then how l will
get now,

176
00:13:40,519 --> 00:13:42,953
My life will ruined because of your
interest,

177
00:13:44,056 --> 00:13:45,956
Leave it,
then what are you doing here?

178
00:13:46,125 --> 00:13:47,217
Take him out,
No, you don't need it,

179
00:13:47,927 --> 00:13:49,758
l will go,
Give me the wood,

180
00:13:50,029 --> 00:13:51,656
Give me the wood,
get lost.

181
00:13:52,464 --> 00:13:56,161
Don't have a single penny in pocket
and watching colorful dreams,

182
00:19:14,553 --> 00:19:17,249
lt's super hit Sahir Jee,
You write it down,

183
00:19:18,090 --> 00:19:20,422
First let him write the rest of the
story,

184
00:19:20,726 --> 00:19:22,717
then write down the fate of film,

185
00:19:23,762 --> 00:19:24,660
Jerry!

186
00:19:24,930 --> 00:19:27,194
Film's flow is good till here,
but what next,

187
00:19:28,800 --> 00:19:31,928
Sir, We have seen a view of one
brother who lived on sky,

188
00:19:32,638 --> 00:19:35,038
then he came out to search his
twin brother,

189
00:19:35,674 --> 00:19:38,142
And real film starts from here.

190
00:19:41,647 --> 00:19:45,208
And the search should be the soul
of the film,

191
00:19:45,817 --> 00:19:48,980
Because every man is searching for
something,

192
00:19:49,721 --> 00:19:51,882
Someone is searching for name,
someone is searching for fame,

193
00:19:52,257 --> 00:19:53,884
someone is searching for money,

194
00:19:54,726 --> 00:19:56,250
and someone is searching....

195
00:19:56,862 --> 00:19:59,296
....for some moments of peace.
You know....

196
00:20:02,100 --> 00:20:03,260
...if this journey of search

197
00:20:03,902 --> 00:20:06,336
we can make it interesting then we
will enjoy the film.

198
00:20:07,272 --> 00:20:10,469
Otherwise in the story of twin
brothers meeting and take apart

199
00:20:10,943 --> 00:20:12,808
what is the new idea?
Sir, locket!

200
00:20:14,413 --> 00:20:15,778
Locket's idea is new,

201
00:20:17,249 --> 00:20:19,183
Very original.

202
00:20:20,152 --> 00:20:23,781
Since childhood a locket like remote
is tied on both brother's neck,

203
00:20:24,923 --> 00:20:29,223
and if one brother touch that locket
then it sounds beep in another's neck

204
00:20:30,195 --> 00:20:32,459
Yes. sir.
We have kept some feeling of technology

205
00:20:32,931 --> 00:20:37,994
ln the climax with that sound of beep
they both search each other.

206
00:20:39,805 --> 00:20:41,272
Do people will beleive on that,

207
00:20:42,708 --> 00:20:45,268
l am sure they will.
l must appreciate your confidence,

208
00:20:45,544 --> 00:20:46,602
and for your courage too.

209
00:20:49,881 --> 00:20:52,509
So much security.
What is this new conspiracy.

210
00:20:53,151 --> 00:20:54,379
Not at all.

211
00:20:54,753 --> 00:20:57,517
Like every successful man l'm paying
for my successful life,

212
00:20:57,689 --> 00:21:00,351
To watch my last picture some
polititions become against on me,

213
00:21:00,525 --> 00:21:01,549
and they become anger on me,
They said....

214
00:21:01,693 --> 00:21:05,026
that we took the side of one community
and neglect their community,

215
00:21:05,163 --> 00:21:08,064
l took a stand and tell them watch the
picture and tell me where is the

216
00:21:08,233 --> 00:21:11,225
mistake, nobody has no answer, even
one politition start telling me

217
00:21:11,403 --> 00:21:14,930
that Mr. Sahir we are like magician
like they brings things from empty

218
00:21:15,107 --> 00:21:17,632
hat and we bring the problems, and
this time l was their target.

219
00:21:17,776 --> 00:21:20,643
lntelligence told me that it could be
dangerous for my life, so it started,

220
00:21:36,762 --> 00:21:39,162
By the way where these twin brothers
are going to meet.

221
00:21:39,431 --> 00:21:42,400
ln the village, that's why one brother
is belong to the sky and other one is

222
00:21:42,534 --> 00:21:45,765
from village, that's why l kept the
movie's title ''Aasman ka Farishta

223
00:21:47,739 --> 00:21:49,604
aur khoon ka rishta''.
You've become so commercial.

224
00:21:50,108 --> 00:21:51,837
By the way in which village you are
going to shoot.

225
00:21:52,110 --> 00:21:54,601
Let's see.
We will find it,

226
00:21:55,781 --> 00:21:57,874
Shoot it in Budbuda Village.
Yes, Sir.

227
00:21:58,050 --> 00:22:01,042
Budbuda!
l've heard it's a nice village.

228
00:22:07,859 --> 00:22:08,757
Bindiya!
Yes!

229
00:22:09,728 --> 00:22:12,094
You came to borrow grain, you made a
promise and disappeared,

230
00:22:12,731 --> 00:22:15,564
You told me that you will give goat's
milk daily, what happened.

231
00:22:16,768 --> 00:22:17,757
What should l do?

232
00:22:17,936 --> 00:22:20,029
Her child drunk all the milk,

233
00:22:20,172 --> 00:22:21,366
then tie them seperate.

234
00:22:22,307 --> 00:22:26,175
l can't tie them seperate, they both
can't live without each other.

235
00:22:26,845 --> 00:22:29,370
lt's just a child,
Just wait for a week,

236
00:22:29,514 --> 00:22:31,004
l'll send you the milk,

237
00:22:33,552 --> 00:22:37,352
This couple is like this, Man carry
money and wife carrys stuff.

238
00:22:39,191 --> 00:22:41,591
Drive slowly,
You don't need to drive fast.

239
00:22:47,032 --> 00:22:48,863
Stop right here.

240
00:22:50,102 --> 00:22:50,966
Carefully!

241
00:23:03,048 --> 00:23:04,675
Some postman was looking for me,

242
00:23:05,417 --> 00:23:07,317
Nobody never finds you,

243
00:23:07,586 --> 00:23:10,851
Not today l've never seen anyone
searching for you.

244
00:23:16,061 --> 00:23:18,427
Why are you laughing?
Someone is dancing naked here.

245
00:23:18,597 --> 00:23:22,124
They laugh unnecessarily.
My poet has print in Gazal Sagar.

246
00:23:22,300 --> 00:23:24,200
and l was expecting it's money order.

247
00:23:25,103 --> 00:23:27,571
Where did you get these flowers?
Did you get married?

248
00:23:27,939 --> 00:23:30,772
Where is the bride?
l've left her hospital for delivery.

249
00:23:30,909 --> 00:23:32,501
You jusy play your games,

250
00:23:33,645 --> 00:23:36,546
Government gave me respect,

251
00:23:36,715 --> 00:23:38,444
For what?

252
00:23:38,617 --> 00:23:41,882
They held up a programme for Gas,

253
00:23:47,926 --> 00:23:51,692
l narrate them such a nice poetry,

254
00:23:52,130 --> 00:23:54,121
people were clapping for me,

255
00:23:54,933 --> 00:23:56,628
You should watch if you would be
there.

256
00:23:57,035 --> 00:23:58,969
l'll narrate you too just order for
tea.

257
00:23:59,137 --> 00:24:02,504
You narrate your poetry in Madan's
shop then l'll get you tea,

258
00:24:02,641 --> 00:24:04,472
Atleast few of them will come from
there.

259
00:24:12,951 --> 00:24:14,578
Tell, whom l have to beat,
Shut up!

260
00:24:15,287 --> 00:24:16,447
Look! what's written on there?

261
00:24:18,089 --> 00:24:22,856
Message, Shave, Cutting.
l'll get everything.

262
00:24:25,197 --> 00:24:28,928
Mr. Damchand, you just got cutting
few days before, let them grow.

263
00:24:29,201 --> 00:24:31,226
but if he will high his prices then...

264
00:24:31,570 --> 00:24:33,800
l'll get more short hair,

265
00:24:33,972 --> 00:24:35,667
and l don't have to spend money soon,

266
00:24:35,907 --> 00:24:38,205
And will he cut proper?
Why he won't?

267
00:24:38,376 --> 00:24:40,469
that day you insult him,

268
00:24:40,779 --> 00:24:43,577
think! your neck is on his chair.

269
00:24:43,715 --> 00:24:46,650
Scissor on his hand, to take avenge
if he cut your ear and throat,

270
00:24:46,985 --> 00:24:48,885
and say sorry then.....
So what?

271
00:24:49,020 --> 00:24:50,851
l'll break his legs.

272
00:24:51,089 --> 00:24:53,717
What is the worth to beat him when
he cut my ears.

273
00:24:53,892 --> 00:24:56,292
then we will beat him first and then
let him allow for your hair cut.

274
00:24:56,595 --> 00:24:58,495
You dumb!
You want me to slap you.

275
00:25:01,600 --> 00:25:05,229
Billu! from today it's your
responsibilty to cut my hair.

276
00:25:05,971 --> 00:25:08,531
Look, l have come here....

277
00:25:21,653 --> 00:25:22,585
Carefully!

278
00:25:25,423 --> 00:25:26,788
What happen?

279
00:25:27,058 --> 00:25:28,616
He broke my chair's tyre,

280
00:25:29,361 --> 00:25:30,726
and his back too.

281
00:25:30,896 --> 00:25:32,625
Let's take him to the hospital.

282
00:25:33,932 --> 00:25:35,866
Don't take me their he suck money
not blood,

283
00:25:36,001 --> 00:25:38,526
Take me to another hospital but
cheaper.

284
00:25:58,523 --> 00:26:01,151
Do you have red paper, alapeno,

285
00:26:01,893 --> 00:26:03,884
Why are you abusing me?

286
00:26:05,030 --> 00:26:06,964
Not abuses these are the vegetable's
names,

287
00:26:07,933 --> 00:26:10,163
l think we have to order them from
city.

288
00:26:10,502 --> 00:26:12,902
Lot of vegetables here,
don't you like them.

289
00:26:14,005 --> 00:26:16,235
We need all of them,

00:26:17,642 --> 00:26:19,269
Listen!
Vegetable Men,

291

For next month don't sell these
vegetables,

292
00:26:23,982 --> 00:26:26,917
then what villagers will eat,
Are you giving a party?

293
00:26:30,422 --> 00:26:33,516

00:26:46,905 --> 00:26:50,136
lt's the only largest godown of the
village,

298
00:26:50,942 --> 00:26:53,308
lt will take rice, flour for 400
people.

299
00:26:54,045 --> 00:26:56,741

a lot of time he came to
school in teacher meeting..

But where they became friends?
ln the college.

529
00:58:21,231 --> 00:58:23,256
Billu went to college.?

530
00:58:23,867 --> 00:58:25,698
he teachs kids the science..

531
00:58:26,703 --> 00:58:27,761
How he became friends..

532
00:58:28,404 --> 00:58:32,238
billu jee pumped his scooter on him,
they have to operate..

533
00:58:33,142 --> 00:58:35,906
lt was big accident.,
he gave him the blood.

534
00:58:36,913 --> 00:58:40,110
Therefore he is saying,
that sahir has his blood..

535
00:58:40,917 --> 00:58:43,442
He called him to bombay,,
for working on films..

00:58:44,420 --> 00:58:46,752
l denied ...
why?

537
00:58:47,857 --> 00:58:50,621

549
01:00:06,536 --> 01:00:08,367
Cause of you its been spread
like fire in whole village..

550
01:00:09,238 --> 01:00:12,002
say like electric..
electric runs faster than fire

551
01:00:14,611 --> 01:00:17,273
There is no peace..
priciple medam called me..

552
01:00:18,281 --> 01:00:20,613
l'll tell her that l dont know any

553
01:00:25,688 --> 01:00:27,986
hence we'll not talk with
each other..

554
01:00:31,527 --> 01:00:34,462
lf you say that you'll not bring
sahir uncle to school..

555
01:00:35,598 --> 01:00:37,759
So you'll see that we'll
not go to school anymore..

556
01:00:47,110 --> 01:00:49,169
For all of us..

557
01:00:49,746 --> 01:00:55,446
lts very proud for us that sahir khan's
friends kids learns in our school.

558
01:00:58,788 --> 01:01:01,780
But billjee..you puts us in very
suspence..

559
01:01:02,492 --> 01:01:04,790
You didn't gets any message from
sahir khan yet..

560
01:01:06,162 --> 01:01:07,322

01:01:32,655 --> 01:01:34,520
So stop the shooting for

01:01:35,158 --> 01:01:36,125
Does it effect anthing?

569

lt'd be the time for lunch
in the shooting?

570
01:01:44,100 --> 01:01:45,465
So he can have half hour
from that..

571
01:01:49,338 --> 01:01:51,636
He's big man...
he'd be busy a lot..

572
01:01:53,242 --> 01:01:56,439
lts your friend..you can force him..

573

895
01:38:45,452 --> 01:38:48,250
You are saying as you know all
film stars very well..

896
01:38:49,857 --> 01:38:51,791
our film industry is
just like an family..

897
01:38:52,493 --> 01:38:54,393
An family..
we have fraternity...

01:39:03,771 --> 01:39:05,033
you know personal..

901
01:39:06,240 --> 01:39:10,199
But there is one in you exceed..

902
01:39:11,011 --> 01:39:13,502
That is money,pride,and the
warmth of the popularity..

903
01:39:14,882 --> 01:39:17,612
And you all thinks that..
there is world because of us..

904
01:39:18,218 --> 01:39:20,743
we came for the purpose of

905
01:39:22,656 --> 01:39:24,180
Sir..will you come in the ceremony.?

906
01:39:24,959 --> 01:39:26,950
He'll definetly come..

907
01:39:29,830 --> 01:39:34,164
He dubay..

908
01:39:35,602 --> 01:39:37,729
this film industry would be an
fiction for you..

909
01:39:38,339 --> 01:39:39,966
But its work for us..

910
01:39:40,741 --> 01:39:42,709
The whole unit working here..

911
01:39:43,310 --> 01:39:44,675
They didn't came for
the party or function.

01:39:47,848 --> 01:39:50,180

lf there is like that..

919
01:40:10,504 --> 01:40:12,369
You have misunderstanding...
about the films star..

920
01:40:13,307 --> 01:40:15,104
ln real life we are local people..

921
01:40:15,976 --> 01:40:18,809
We likes little things..
we got happy with little things..

922
01:40:19,747 --> 01:40:21,180
We got anger with little things..

923
01:40:22,182 --> 01:40:27,210
So miss principle..before l slap him
under his ear..get him out from here..

lf you have then give me,

Why? can't you talk to your father?

Everyone is going to see him,

1051
01:53:12,819 --> 01:53:14,150
May l ask you one thing,

1052
01:53:20,960 --> 01:53:23,827
Do you really know Sahir Khan,

1053
01:53:29,302 --> 01:53:30,462
l know him or not,

1054
01:53:32,605 --> 01:53:34,664
lt doesn't matter on our lives,

1055
01:53:38,311 --> 01:53:39,573
l've seen his many films,

1056
01:53:43,983 --> 01:53:46,451

1057
01:53:49,889 --> 01:53:51,550
lf you say then....

1058
01:53:53,159 --> 01:53:53,591
Go!

1059
01:53:56,429 --> 01:53:56,793
Stop!

1060
01:53:57,964 --> 01:54:00,262
Many people will be there,
don't go alone,

1061
01:54:12,445 --> 01:54:14,242
Sahir Khan has come,
not yet,

1062
01:54:14,547 --> 01:54:16,208
lt means we are on time,

1063
01:54:17,550 --> 01:54:20,018
Go and tell school people what l
thought,

1064
01:54:25,491 --> 01:54:27,789
Our boss damchand is here,

1065
01:54:28,094 --> 01:54:31,325
so what should l do,
he is saying if you insist him,

1066
01:54:31,598 --> 01:54:34,658
then he will give a speech about
sahir khan,

1067
01:54:35,201 --> 01:54:38,261
That will be a big pleasure for us,

1068
01:54:40,206 --> 01:54:41,104
But there is a condition,

1069
01:54:41,875 --> 01:54:44,070
You have to sit him next to
Sahir Khan.

1070
01:54:44,544 --> 01:54:47,069
Why next, we will sit hip up on
his arms,

1071
01:54:47,313 --> 01:54:48,507
Get lost from here,

1072
01:54:58,157 --> 01:55:00,057
Are they agreed?
No,

1073
01:55:00,727 --> 01:55:01,250
What did they say?

1074
01:55:02,061 --> 01:55:03,722
May l?
Tell!

1075
01:55:04,664 --> 01:55:07,326
They said that tell that idiot, crazy
dog,

01:55:12,605 --> 01:55:14,869
Did somebody hear that?
No!

1078
01:55:17,777 --> 01:55:20,405
lf someone will know in village
then l won't spare you.

1079
01:55:24,784 --> 01:55:25,978
Mr.Sahir is on the way,

1080
01:55:27,387 --> 01:55:29,082
And water bottles and....

1081
01:55:32,091 --> 01:55:33,422
Come on,
Move,

1082
01:55:34,260 --> 01:55:37,354
Hey! When l wear flowers to Sahir

1102
01:56:37,690 --> 01:56:40,022
Wear it after speech,

01:58:05,978 --> 01:58:06,774
Gullu!

1113
01:58:15,822 --> 01:58:17,915
Our respected Mr. Sahir Khan,

1114
01:58:19,025 --> 01:58:21,118
respected people of budbuda village

1115
01:58:21,794 --> 01:58:24,888
my colleagues of school and students,

1116
01:58:25,731 --> 01:58:28,063
don't be confuse,
l am not going to speak much,

1117
01:58:29,302 --> 01:58:33,204
because what's going on here,
that's a dream or truth.

1118
01:58:35,007 --> 01:58:36,440
l ain't understand yet,

1119
01:58:37,176 --> 01:58:39,872
Nobody of us didn't imagine that,

1120
01:58:40,246 --> 01:58:43,977
ln a small village like budbuda a
great celebrity will come,

1121
01:58:44,150 --> 01:58:48,484
and it will come face to face,
To listen Mr. Sahir's name in front

1122
01:58:48,855 --> 01:58:55,693
of our eyes all those moments come
what he played in his different roles,

1123
01:58:56,195 --> 01:58:58,629
Mr. Sahir is the biggest star of our
country.

1124
01:58:59,198 --> 01:59:01,996
and l don't need to issue any
certificate of that thing,

1125
01:59:02,935 --> 01:59:04,095
Move fast,

1126
01:59:56,088 --> 02:00:01,424
My greetings to everyone,

1127
02:00:02,128 --> 02:00:04,392
and lot of love,

1128
02:00:05,164 --> 02:00:07,189
this film's shooting has suppose to be
in some village,

1129
02:00:08,000 --> 02:00:10,594
and unfortunately l called up your
village name,

1130
02:00:11,370 --> 02:00:12,098
Budbudha,

1131
02:00:13,372 --> 02:00:16,535
l've heard in childhood that your
village is a nice place,

1132
02:00:18,578 --> 02:00:19,840
Principle said it right,

1133
02:00:20,513 --> 02:00:23,243
l really never thought to come between
all of you people,

1134
02:00:23,649 --> 02:00:26,083
l'll become a part of your land,

1135
02:00:26,953 --> 02:00:30,582
Actually, what human thinks about
his life,

1136
02:00:31,924 --> 02:00:35,416
it's not necessary that God has also
thinks the same,

1137
02:00:36,229 --> 02:00:37,856
that's why someone has said,

1138
02:00:38,364 --> 02:00:41,959
lf you want to make laugh God then
as a joke

1139
02:00:42,635 --> 02:00:45,468
tell him your future plannings,

1140
02:00:46,305 --> 02:00:49,035
Anyway, first of all,

1141
02:00:49,609 --> 02:00:52,134
l'm appologizing you from the bottom
of my heart,

1142
02:00:52,712 --> 02:00:55,374
that you people couldn't see our
shooting properly,

1143
02:00:56,582 --> 02:00:59,415
Actually, my last movie was little
bit controvercial,

1144
02:00:59,885 --> 02:01:02,877
and because of that government gave
me much security,

1145
02:01:04,290 --> 02:01:07,259
Just because of this security what
problems you people faced,

1146
02:01:08,194 --> 02:01:11,425
Believe it, l'm facing problems more
than that,

1147
02:01:12,632 --> 02:01:18,832
that's why l to leaving all those
things away l came near to you.

1148
02:01:19,705 --> 02:01:23,971
l have been told that l should give
speech to childrens,

1149
02:01:27,480 --> 02:01:28,640
lt's such a big word,

1150
02:01:29,248 --> 02:01:32,581
Forgive me, respected principle,
but l can't speak big things,

1151
02:01:32,852 --> 02:01:37,312
But l would like say one thing to
my little friends,

1152
02:01:38,190 --> 02:01:42,854
Childrens, your childhood are the
beautiful and finest days of

1153
02:01:43,329 --> 02:01:44,421
your life.

1154
02:01:45,264 --> 02:01:47,596
So, sitting there chunny will say,

1155
02:01:48,000 --> 02:01:50,662
that sahir l've lost my teeth and l
am feeling pain,

1156
02:01:51,270 --> 02:01:55,764
here bunty will say that teacher
punished me today,

1157
02:01:57,076 --> 02:01:59,203
some children would have a fear
of exams,

1158
02:01:59,779 --> 02:02:03,180
then these are not beautiful days.

1159
02:02:04,350 --> 02:02:07,217
Yes, l am believing you that

1160
02:02:07,586 --> 02:02:08,575
these are the most beautiful days,

1161
02:02:09,755 --> 02:02:11,222
because bunty when you will grow up,

1162
02:02:12,024 --> 02:02:14,822
and your shave will like this man,

1163
02:02:15,728 --> 02:02:19,789
Chuny, when you will become a pilot
and when you'll have tension to fly

1164
02:02:20,933 --> 02:02:22,764
a plane then you all will die for
these days,

1165
02:02:23,269 --> 02:02:27,433
But then these days and these moments
won't come back,

1166
02:02:29,241 --> 02:02:31,709
Today, your heart is true,

1167
02:02:32,712 --> 02:02:34,873
lt's noble,
lt's shining gold,

1168
02:02:36,615 --> 02:02:38,310
Today, what relations you will make
with your heart,

1169
02:02:39,485 --> 02:02:41,976
what friends you will make,
Friends like, Relations like,

1170
02:02:42,922 --> 02:02:44,446
will never make in life,

1171
02:02:45,591 --> 02:02:48,822
Today, to see you people,
l lost in my childhood,

1172
02:02:50,730 --> 02:02:52,322
You have nice clothes for wearing,

1173
02:02:53,399 --> 02:02:55,765
Good books for reading,
Nice food for eating,

1174
02:02:56,335 --> 02:02:59,133
and may be to see me here you people
don't beleive,

1175
02:02:59,872 --> 02:03:00,839
that in my childhood,

1176
02:03:01,841 --> 02:03:03,433
l didn't have it all,

1177
02:03:05,311 --> 02:03:09,179
My childhood was so decent and poor,

1178
02:03:09,682 --> 02:03:11,445
l wasn't filmstar sahir l was

1179
02:03:12,284 --> 02:03:13,182
just sahir,

1180
02:03:15,921 --> 02:03:17,548
My father was a poor man,

1181
02:03:18,591 --> 02:03:20,081
we had nothing,

1182
02:03:21,894 --> 02:03:24,795
but in everyone's childhood there is
someone,

1183
02:03:25,698 --> 02:03:29,225
who left his deep effect on our
little souls,

1184
02:03:31,237 --> 02:03:35,503
He became a partner of our mischiefs
and our troubles,

1185
02:03:36,942 --> 02:03:40,742
he became our friend,
he became our partner,

1186
02:03:43,749 --> 02:03:45,717
l had a partner in my childhood,

1187
02:03:47,720 --> 02:03:48,687
My support,

1188
02:03:52,191 --> 02:03:53,385
My God's light,

1189
02:03:57,263 --> 02:03:57,854
Billu!

1190
02:04:01,367 --> 02:04:01,958
Billu!

1191
02:04:03,636 --> 02:04:04,625
My friend,

1192
02:04:11,777 --> 02:04:12,744
l remember,

1193
02:04:14,447 --> 02:04:16,312
during the break in school,

1194
02:04:17,516 --> 02:04:19,245
childrens ate food from their tiffon,

1195
02:04:20,419 --> 02:04:22,046
l put my hand to tap

1196
02:04:23,456 --> 02:04:24,718
and l drunk just water,

1197
02:04:26,792 --> 02:04:27,884
then to touch my shoulder,

1198
02:04:29,361 --> 02:04:31,192
raising his tiffon to me,

1199
02:04:32,498 --> 02:04:32,987
Billu!

1200
02:04:35,034 --> 02:04:35,796
My friend,

1201
02:04:43,576 --> 02:04:45,373
My hair were long like girls,

1202
02:04:46,145 --> 02:04:49,205
but to cut them l didn't have a penny
in my pocket,

1203
02:04:50,683 --> 02:04:53,117
To get an advantage of his father's
absence on shop,

1204
02:04:55,254 --> 02:04:56,653
my hair cutter,

1205
02:04:59,425 --> 02:05:00,016
billu!

1206
02:05:02,161 --> 02:05:02,855
My friend,

1207
02:05:06,265 --> 02:05:09,757
When l was sad to missing my mom,

1208
02:05:11,971 --> 02:05:13,836
then stealing money from his
father's safe,

1209
02:05:16,008 --> 02:05:17,236
he took me for movies,

1210
02:05:18,110 --> 02:05:18,599
billu!

1211
02:05:20,145 --> 02:05:20,975
my friend,

1212
02:05:24,683 --> 02:05:26,150
When we returning our homes in
evening,

1213
02:05:27,086 --> 02:05:28,917
to gave me greed of peanuts,

1214
02:05:30,489 --> 02:05:32,923
he made me perody of film characters,

1215
02:05:35,528 --> 02:05:36,426
Those evenings,

1216
02:05:37,930 --> 02:05:39,261
in the journey of those streets,

1217
02:05:40,900 --> 02:05:44,495
Billu found out my inside actor,

1218
02:05:50,643 --> 02:05:52,076
l didn't believe on myself,

1219
02:05:53,746 --> 02:05:55,304
as much billu was believing on me,

1220
02:06:01,387 --> 02:06:02,354
One day.

1221
02:06:04,223 --> 02:06:06,817
to sold his gold earings,

1222
02:06:07,593 --> 02:06:09,390
he gave me mumbai ticket,

1223
02:06:10,362 --> 02:06:12,353
and kept the rest of money in my
pocket,

1224
02:06:15,100 --> 02:06:17,830
l hold his hand and asked him how
l'll return this money,

1225
02:06:18,604 --> 02:06:20,333
then he told you don't need to return
them,

1226
02:06:21,407 --> 02:06:25,070
Just any poor man,

1227
02:06:28,347 --> 02:06:29,609
and remember me,

1228
02:06:30,950 --> 02:06:33,009
that's enough,

1229
02:06:37,756 --> 02:06:38,814
then l came to mumbai,

1230
02:06:40,225 --> 02:06:42,625
To see this running life,

1231
02:06:44,863 --> 02:06:46,956
l became filmstar sahir khan from
sahir,

1232
02:06:51,003 --> 02:06:54,336
l went back to our village to find
my friend,

1233
02:06:55,507 --> 02:06:56,474
but he didn't meet me,

1234
02:06:59,011 --> 02:07:01,980
Someone told me that he felt in
love with some girl,

1235
02:07:03,382 --> 02:07:04,314
and she was not from his community,

1236
02:07:04,984 --> 02:07:08,078
Villagers were against him,
So saving his life

1237
02:07:08,754 --> 02:07:11,052
he ran away from the village,

1238
02:07:19,565 --> 02:07:21,499
l would like to tell you the truth,

1239
02:07:22,868 --> 02:07:24,165
Today l have everything,

1240
02:07:25,371 --> 02:07:26,201
Name, Fame,

1241
02:07:26,639 --> 02:07:30,598
Wherever l go, millions of people
came after me, calls my name,

1242
02:07:32,511 --> 02:07:34,979
Every place surrounds from my name,

1243
02:07:36,949 --> 02:07:37,881
But still today,

1244
02:07:38,951 --> 02:07:40,441
in those millions of voices,

1245
02:07:42,087 --> 02:07:43,918
l always search one voice,

1246
02:07:57,202 --> 02:07:58,931
You never told me anything,

1247
02:08:01,140 --> 02:08:02,266
You sold your earing,

1248
02:08:03,776 --> 02:08:04,868
that tiffon's matter,

1249
02:08:07,546 --> 02:08:08,911
but he remember everything,

1250
02:08:12,217 --> 02:08:12,649
Yes!

1251
02:08:15,554 --> 02:08:17,181
Even l didn't thought that he....

1252
02:08:19,258 --> 02:08:19,986
....will remember everything,

1253
02:08:24,463 --> 02:08:27,523
l can live my entire life with that
happiness,

1254
02:08:30,602 --> 02:08:32,126
that sahir still misses me,

1255
02:08:35,274 --> 02:08:36,332
l don't need anything from him,

1256
02:08:39,478 --> 02:08:40,240
His heart,

1257
02:08:42,548 --> 02:08:43,344
is very big.

1258
02:08:46,618 --> 02:08:48,552
and see where he reached,

1259
02:08:53,926 --> 02:08:57,123
what happen?
programme has finished,

1260
02:09:00,799 --> 02:09:01,823
then why did you came home,

1261
02:09:02,601 --> 02:09:04,796
We feel cry,
so we came home,

1262
02:09:12,478 --> 02:09:14,070
Forgive us father,

1263
02:09:14,446 --> 02:09:16,744
We made a big mistake,

1264
02:09:29,528 --> 02:09:31,723
lf l would be on your age then l
would said the same,

1265
02:10:10,102 --> 02:10:12,332
Whatever you said,

1266
02:10:13,839 --> 02:10:14,703
l heard everything,

1267
02:10:18,710 --> 02:10:20,109
l was wrong about you,

1268
02:10:21,413 --> 02:10:23,404
that you will become a big man,

1269
02:10:24,383 --> 02:10:27,216
so you will forget everything,
l forgot everything,

1270
02:10:30,689 --> 02:10:33,351
l searched you alot,
but you didn't meet my anywhere,

1271
02:10:35,160 --> 02:10:37,025
But you can find my address,

1272
02:10:39,865 --> 02:10:41,298
You never felt to meet me,

1273
02:10:43,335 --> 02:10:44,927
When l ran from village then l met
many problems,

1274
02:10:46,738 --> 02:10:49,571
Empty hands, responsibility,
new place,

1275
02:10:50,209 --> 02:10:53,474
to standing this house and business
much time has spend

1276
02:10:54,746 --> 02:10:58,045
And you rise very quick then....

1277
02:10:58,684 --> 02:11:00,117
l make plans but....

1278
02:11:04,156 --> 02:11:05,453
You are gone so far,

1279
02:11:07,359 --> 02:11:08,690
then l lost my hope,

1280
02:11:10,362 --> 02:11:11,329
to meet you,

1281
02:11:15,667 --> 02:11:19,364
My condition is very bad, and l don't
want you to see me in this condition,

1282
02:11:23,442 --> 02:11:24,136
Leave it,

1283
02:11:25,310 --> 02:11:26,538
lt was my self respect,

1284
02:11:27,546 --> 02:11:28,137
it was my shame,

1285
02:11:29,581 --> 02:11:31,811
Shame?

1286
02:11:34,186 --> 02:11:34,743
l felt,

1287
02:11:35,854 --> 02:11:36,616
Forgive me,

1288
02:11:57,276 --> 02:11:57,708

1289
02:11:59,111 --> 02:11:59,475

1290
02:12:08,820 --> 02:12:09,377
Come here,

1291
02:12:10,522 --> 02:12:11,250

1292
02:12:11,924 --> 02:12:14,290

Dugu?

1293
02:12:14,559 --> 02:12:16,686

1294
02:12:17,162 --> 02:12:19,357

but l will be back soon,

1299
02:12:30,542 --> 02:12:32,373
We will go to our village together,

1300
02:12:33,745 --> 02:12:35,110
and if possible you stay there,

1301
02:12:36,515 --> 02:12:39,143
that we should live our memories
again,

1302
02:13:06,111 --> 02:13:09,376
He is my uncle,
and others are neighbours,

1303
02:13:17,589 --> 02:13:19,318
Sir, l have write a poem,

1306
02:13:44,049 --> 02:13:46,381
No, it's enough,

1307
02:13:47,085 --> 02:13:48,780
Now nobody offers me these kind of
songs,
