00:02:06,733 --> 00:02:07,733
Thanks!

4
00:02:07,982 --> 00:02:10,453
- Hello Bill!

00:02:10,462 --> 00:02:11,343

00:02:11,344 --> 00:02:13,671
Gee you sure look pretty

00:02:14,904 --> 00:02:17,627
Hey wait a minute!
Gee you sure got that quick enough.

8
00:02:17,775 --> 00:02:19,679
There ya are Josh.
That's married life for ya.

9
00:02:20,270 --> 00:02:22,021
Yeah, isn't that beautiful.

10
00:02:22,192 --> 00:02:25,000
You know if the world was run right,
only woman would get married.

11
00:02:25,001 --> 00:02:26,109
Yeah.

12
00:02:27,162 --> 00:02:28,355
Hey, could they do that?

13
00:02:30,862 --> 00:02:31,762
Get a load of that.

14
00:02:31,862 --> 00:02:34,826
What did you do break your arm? I
haven't heard from you in three months.

15
00:02:34,926 --> 00:02:35,962
I've been very busy.

16
00:02:35,963 --> 00:02:38,252
Oh, you've been very busy.
I can imagine.

17
00:02:40,471 --> 00:02:42,857
Dewey! He got bigger!

18
00:02:42,858 --> 00:02:45,008
What did you think he'd get? Littler?

19
00:02:45,126 --> 00:02:48,004
Hey Mom lookat.
Here's Pops squeezing a hula dancer.

20
00:02:48,052 --> 00:02:48,891
Give me that.

21
00:02:52,291 --> 00:02:53,635
So you were been busy. Huh?

22
00:02:54,016 --> 00:02:55,428
Wait till I get you home.

23
00:02:55,610 --> 00:02:57,737
Come on! Push Dewey.

24
00:02:59,534 --> 00:03:00,534
Ouuuu!

25
00:03:02,629 --> 00:03:05,826
Well, Mr. Ace Lannigan,
let that be a lesson to you.

26
00:03:05,899 --> 00:03:07,231
- A lesson to me?
- Yeah.

27
00:03:07,312 --> 00:03:10,286
Say listen, if they lined up all those
movie queens in Hollywood and let them

28
00:03:10,287 --> 00:03:12,915
wave those long eyelashes at me you
know what I would do?

29
00:03:13,011 --> 00:03:13,711
Huh?

30
00:03:13,735 --> 00:03:14,832
I'd throw rocks at 'em.

31
00:03:14,932 --> 00:03:17,037
- A yessss.
- Toss 'em right at 'em.

32
00:03:18,312 --> 00:03:21,248
- I just brush them off like flies.
- Oh yes.

33
00:03:21,461 --> 00:03:23,615
Which of you two is Ace Lannigan?

34
00:03:23,834 --> 00:03:24,774
That's me.

35
00:03:28,150 --> 00:03:29,907
Know a gal named Cherry?

36
00:03:30,804 --> 00:03:32,406
Cherry!?
Wa....

37
00:03:34,480 --> 00:03:35,480
No.

38
00:03:35,658 --> 00:03:38,513
Why sure you do.
That's the little blond you told me...

39
00:03:41,947 --> 00:03:43,478
Yeah sure, I know Cherry.

40
00:03:44,516 --> 00:03:45,980
Brilliant conversationalist.

41
00:03:46,217 --> 00:03:47,094
How's she doing?

42
00:03:47,157 --> 00:03:48,643
She's getting married.

43
00:03:49,009 --> 00:03:51,183
Oh, well what do you know.

44
00:03:51,659 --> 00:03:53,436
- Great kid Cherry.
- Yes.

45
00:03:53,536 --> 00:03:55,228
So little Cherry's getting married.

46
00:03:55,344 --> 00:03:57,635
Yeah, she what's you to
come to the weddin'.

47
00:03:57,837 --> 00:03:59,886
Well I don't know. If I'm around.
Who's she marring?

48
00:04:00,013 --> 00:04:00,949
You!

49
00:04:01,185 --> 00:04:03,958
Well she couldn't have
picked a better... Me!?

50
00:04:04,923 --> 00:04:06,101
Can I be an usher?

51
00:04:07,784 --> 00:04:10,763
Wait there must be some mistake.
All I did was take her to a movie.

52
00:04:10,850 --> 00:04:12,521
Yeah! And keep her out half the night.

53
00:04:12,621 --> 00:04:14,273
Well can I help it if
there double features?

54
00:04:14,373 --> 00:04:17,483
Can he help it if there...
Come on, you're going with us.

55
00:04:17,484 --> 00:04:20,140
Yeah well, all right. All right.

56
00:04:20,332 --> 00:04:21,332
I'm going with them.

57
00:04:21,605 --> 00:04:23,144
Oh... You're going with them.

58
00:04:23,306 --> 00:04:25,004
- Yeah, I'm going with them.
- Oh...

59
00:04:25,331 --> 00:04:27,846
Patty-cake patty-cake
bakers man...

60
00:04:27,932 --> 00:04:30,482
bake a cake as fast as you can...

61
00:05:02,253 --> 00:05:03,869
This sort of thing has got to stop.

62
00:05:04,431 --> 00:05:06,547
Spreading the Mallon name
all over the newspapers.

63
00:05:07,404 --> 00:05:09,595
Getting your self mixed up
in a water front brawl.

64
00:05:09,644 --> 00:05:11,738
I've never heard of any thing
more disgraceful in my life.

65
00:05:11,838 --> 00:05:14,761
Oh, it's not as bad as that.
Now take it easy skipper.

66
00:05:15,097 --> 00:05:16,512
- All right O'Keef.
- Yes sir.

67
00:05:19,683 --> 00:05:23,013
You seem to think the world is just
some sort of a three ring circus.

68
00:05:23,014 --> 00:05:24,942
And all you've got to do
is run around and have fun.

69
00:05:25,093 --> 00:05:26,395
What's wrong with that?

70
00:05:26,423 --> 00:05:28,409
The world won't let you.
That's what's wrong with that.

71
00:05:28,540 --> 00:05:29,980
No, you mean the Mallon's won't let me.

72
00:05:30,038 --> 00:05:30,872
Won't let you what?

73
00:05:31,144 --> 00:05:32,535
What are we keeping you from doing?

74
00:05:33,077 --> 00:05:35,958
Oh gee skipper, you have been
singing this song at me for years.

75
00:05:35,959 --> 00:05:38,178
Now I know eventually
you're going to trap me.

76
00:05:38,211 --> 00:05:40,577
But you can't blame me for
holding out as long as I can.

77
00:05:40,956 --> 00:05:42,221
Now look here Josh,

78
00:05:42,447 --> 00:05:45,915
I'd like to sit on a corral
reef and play a ukulele my self.

79
00:05:46,462 --> 00:05:47,485
But we are Mallon's.

80
00:05:47,486 --> 00:05:50,421
It's taken nearly 200 years
to build up this business.

81
00:05:50,449 --> 00:05:52,805
And it's my duty and it's
your duty to carry on.

82
00:05:53,223 --> 00:05:56,739
We've got stockholders, customers,
ships, all over the world.

83
00:05:56,892 --> 00:05:59,601
Well then what's wrong with one of
the Mallon's sailing on some of them?

84
00:06:01,115 --> 00:06:03,370
You've dodged your
responsibilities long enough.

85
00:06:03,931 --> 00:06:06,336
Starting next Monday you're taking
over the maintenance department.

86
00:06:06,337 --> 00:06:07,952
Office hours 9 to 5.

87
00:06:07,991 --> 00:06:11,144
Oh no. Oh no, I'm not going to
wind up back of that desk like you.

88
00:06:11,145 --> 00:06:13,940
Pushing buttons and
growling and barking at everybody.

89
00:06:14,089 --> 00:06:14,918
That's not for me dad.

90
00:06:14,919 --> 00:06:17,376
I what to be one of the boys.
I want to be a regular guy.

91
00:06:17,430 --> 00:06:18,908
- A regular guy.
- Yeah.

92
00:06:19,008 --> 00:06:21,178
The poor house is full of regular guys.

93
00:06:21,329 --> 00:06:23,330
You're going to accept
you're responsibility

94
00:06:23,331 --> 00:06:25,332
just like I did from my father.

95
00:06:25,333 --> 00:06:27,316
And just like he did from his father.

96
00:06:27,334 --> 00:06:30,833
Yea, there's the old captain.
Fellow that started the whole thing.

97
00:06:30,933 --> 00:06:33,018
He was a man and he
only had one ship too.

98
00:06:33,212 --> 00:06:34,440
And we've got eighty.

99
00:06:34,499 --> 00:06:37,727
Well let's sell 79. Take the others
sail around and have some laughs.

100
00:06:37,837 --> 00:06:40,387
Don't be ridicules.
What about Gloria?

101
00:06:41,758 --> 00:06:44,440
When I was your age,
I was married and had you.

102
00:06:44,712 --> 00:06:48,763
Suppose I'd gone vagabonding around
the world. Where would you be now?

103
00:06:50,113 --> 00:06:51,922
Well, you've got me there skipper.

104
00:06:52,022 --> 00:06:54,352
Mr. Mallon, Miss Gloria Wycott.

105
00:06:56,513 --> 00:06:57,923
See I told you it would be alright.

106
00:06:58,500 --> 00:07:00,969
- Josh! Darling!
- Well hello.

107
00:07:01,121 --> 00:07:03,474
- How are you.
- You look wonderful.

108
00:07:03,574 --> 00:07:05,141
- Feel good.
- You're as brown as a coconut.

109
00:07:05,241 --> 00:07:07,066
I saw the headlines in
the paper this morning

110
00:07:07,067 --> 00:07:09,154
"Waterfront brawl!"
and I said Josh is back.

111
00:07:09,251 --> 00:07:11,146
Well that was just a couple of
guys got out of line we had to...

112
00:07:11,147 --> 00:07:12,814
Now have you to big
businessmen settled everything?

113
00:07:12,815 --> 00:07:13,610
No, as a matter of fact we...

114
00:07:13,611 --> 00:07:14,744
What's it going to be a vice-president?

115
00:07:14,745 --> 00:07:15,445
Who?

116
00:07:15,446 --> 00:07:17,703
Oh, please don't make him a
vice-president. Make him work!

117
00:07:17,704 --> 00:07:19,479
Well we haven't progressed that far.
As a matter of fa...

118
00:07:19,480 --> 00:07:22,388
Josh, I found the sweetest apartment
sixteen stories up on a hill.

119
00:07:22,389 --> 00:07:23,338
Overlooking the sea.

120
00:07:23,339 --> 00:07:25,416
- How for?
- For us.

121
00:07:25,417 --> 00:07:27,321
- Well I...
- You can watch the ships come and go.

122
00:07:27,322 --> 00:07:30,123
- Well I think I'll run along.
- Where we going dad?

123
00:07:30,831 --> 00:07:32,535
I leave him to you Gloria.

124
00:07:34,141 --> 00:07:36,146
- Come on Josh, sit down in that chair.
- Where?

125
00:07:36,147 --> 00:07:37,680
Right there.
I want to see how you look in it.

126
00:07:37,681 --> 00:07:38,746
What for?

127
00:07:39,821 --> 00:07:41,317
Oh you look wonderful there.

128
00:07:41,318 --> 00:07:43,167
- Yeah
- That's where you belong Josh.

129
00:07:43,446 --> 00:07:44,783
I don't feel so cozy.

130
00:07:44,951 --> 00:07:46,727
Skipper looks all right back here but...

131
00:07:47,111 --> 00:07:47,811
What's this?

132
00:07:47,812 --> 00:07:49,899
Sketches for our apartment.
I did them all my self.

133
00:07:51,927 --> 00:07:52,901
What's that?

134
00:07:52,902 --> 00:07:53,849
The living room.

135
00:07:53,850 --> 00:07:54,726
- The living room?
- Uh huh.

136
00:07:54,727 --> 00:07:57,093
- Very gay. Fuchsia and blue.
- Blue and who?

137
00:07:57,094 --> 00:07:58,668
- Fuchsia and blue.
- Yeah.

138
00:07:59,691 --> 00:08:01,117
Now look, at the dinning room.

139
00:08:01,118 --> 00:08:02,392
- The dinning room!
- Yeah.

140
00:08:02,722 --> 00:08:04,723
Look at that table,
when it's open it will seat forty.

141
00:08:04,724 --> 00:08:05,552
Forty what?

142
00:08:05,553 --> 00:08:07,052
Forty people silly.

143
00:08:07,053 --> 00:08:09,277
I'll have to get on a scooter
to pass you the salt.

144
00:08:09,278 --> 00:08:11,312
Oh Josh, you're mad.

145
00:08:11,861 --> 00:08:13,745
Look, that's your room.

146
00:08:13,746 --> 00:08:15,033
Looks like a drive-in.

147
00:08:16,861 --> 00:08:18,403
What's that big affair
in the middle there?

148
00:08:18,404 --> 00:08:20,169
- That's the bed.
- The bed?

149
00:08:20,170 --> 00:08:21,270
Can you get forty in there?

150
00:08:21,271 --> 00:08:23,557
- Oh Josh.
- I like those shelves though.

151
00:08:23,558 --> 00:08:25,736
Those will be nice.
I can put my ship models on them huh?

152
00:08:26,505 --> 00:08:28,524
Oh darling, no not there.

153
00:08:28,525 --> 00:08:29,225
Oh I got some wonderful...

154
00:08:29,226 --> 00:08:31,964
I got a little clipper in a bottle
that I got from a fellow that...

155
00:08:31,965 --> 00:08:34,406
Oh honey no,
their not smart any more.

156
00:08:34,407 --> 00:08:36,608
- Oh.
- I thought something delicate.

157
00:08:36,913 --> 00:08:39,479
Porcelain.
Perhaps some little Chinese men.

158
00:08:39,480 --> 00:08:41,070
Yeah, we can have them do the laundry.

159
00:08:41,576 --> 00:08:44,332
Oh Josh, well you'll
like it when it's finished.

160
00:08:44,333 --> 00:08:45,139
Well I hope so.

161
00:08:45,372 --> 00:08:47,090
Wonderful having you back.

Missed you dreadfully.

165
00:08:57,315 --> 00:09:00,902
Yes, a-hum.

166
00:09:00,903 --> 00:09:02,628
All for you Josh.

167
00:09:02,878 --> 00:09:04,825
After dinner we'll drive
out into the country.

168
00:09:04,826 --> 00:09:08,975
The nights have been divine.
The biggest yellowest moon you ever saw.

169
00:09:09,845 --> 00:09:10,851
Josh...

170
00:09:15,553 --> 00:09:19,745

Hey, hiya Josh.

174
00:09:32,182 --> 00:09:34,269
Oh boy you better stay
right where you are.

175
00:09:34,573 --> 00:09:37,300
Cherry's family is parading up and down
looking for the whites of your eyes.

176
00:09:37,301 --> 00:09:39,097
Yeah well they won't find
any whites in my eyes.

177
00:09:39,098 --> 00:09:41,018

178
00:09:41,019 --> 00:09:42,653

179
00:09:42,654 --> 00:09:44,284
- Swell. Take the pole.

180
00:09:44,285 --> 00:09:45,467

181
00:09:46,792 --> 00:09:49,578
- Hey what no caviar?

182
00:09:49,588 --> 00:09:52,128
Hey, what are you doing with

186
00:09:56,417 --> 00:09:58,576

00:10:03,840 --> 00:10:06,837
Why you double crossin'
moon-struck pushover.

190
00:10:07,126 --> 00:10:10,441
Gloria hits you with a little billin'
and cooin' and bang your a dead pigeon.

191
00:10:10,442 --> 00:10:12,026
Listen, I wouldn't talk if I were you

192
00:10:12,027 --> 00:10:13,886
with that Cherry family
parading up and down.

193
00:10:13,887 --> 00:10:16,408
Yeah well don't worry about me,
I'm the "Rock of Gibraltar".

194
00:10:17,929 --> 00:10:18,973
How'd they hook you anyway?

195
00:10:18,974 --> 00:10:21,856
Well they dangled a little thing
called family tradition in front of me.

196
00:10:22,356 --> 00:10:25,459
Seems the world can't get along
with out a long line of Mallons.

197
00:10:25,460 --> 00:10:27,680
Yeah, what happens when
you get to 100? Bingo?

198
00:10:28,007 --> 00:10:28,936
Hey, I got a strike!

199
00:10:30,501 --> 00:10:31,806
I've been waiting two years!

200
00:10:31,807 --> 00:10:34,553
Run the boat! Run the boat!
Pull away will ya Wally.

201
00:10:34,554 --> 00:10:37,299
- Don't scratch my boat.
- Boy this is one of the home guards.

202
00:10:40,135 --> 00:10:41,535
Conserve you're strength.

203
00:10:41,943 --> 00:10:42,857
Stay with it now.

204
00:10:43,161 --> 00:10:45,077
Ok, give him a little slack.
Little slack.

205
00:10:45,112 --> 00:10:47,214
Little slack? He's got me
pealed down to a nub now!

206
00:10:47,215 --> 00:10:49,167
Ok now, watch it. Hold it.

207
00:10:49,168 --> 00:10:51,309
I think we got one of the
Cherry brothers on there.

208
00:10:51,310 --> 00:10:54,565
Yeah, well give him plenty of slack.
Just let it out, just let it out.

209

200 lbs!
He goes 400 if he goes and ounce.

211
00:10:59,597 --> 00:11:01,178
Boy, he ain't any sardine.

212
00:11:06,677 --> 00:11:07,391
There they are over there.

213
00:11:07,392 --> 00:11:08,441
I'd like to get a picture
of the four of them.

214
00:11:08,442 --> 00:11:09,491
What do you say Dick.

215
00:11:09,492 --> 00:11:11,353
Mr. Mallon, would you mine standing up.

216

That's fine. Would you put your
hand on Mr. Wycott's shoulder please.

You know, prospective
father-in-laws and all that.

221
00:11:25,742 --> 00:11:28,782
Yes. And Miss Wycott, would you
move closer to your brother please.

222
00:11:28,869 --> 00:11:30,351

00:12:09,847 --> 00:12:11,863
Boy, I don't know whether I gonna
have him fileted or broiled.

238
00:12:11,864 --> 00:12:12,737
How do you like 'em.

239
00:12:12,738 --> 00:12:15,272
- I'd like him in the boat.
- Yeah, that's not a bad idea.

240
00:12:15,663 --> 00:12:17,112
Hey! He's still alive!

241
00:12:17,113 --> 00:12:20,215
He won't give up.
He must be a republican. Ohhh.

242
00:12:27,066 --> 00:12:28,066
Oh, there you are.

243
00:12:28,067 --> 00:12:30,733
- I've been looking all over for you.

247
00:12:42,248 --> 00:12:44,870

248
00:12:44,871 --> 00:12:47,411

257
00:13:10,487 --> 00:13:11,480

261
00:13:17,888 --> 00:13:19,760

265
00:13:28,183 --> 00:13:29,928
That's one zeros in the 400.

266
00:13:30,715 --> 00:13:33,531
- How about one of you an Mr. Mallon?
- Get me with the fish.

267
00:13:33,532 --> 00:13:35,383
No darling please, after dinner.

268
00:13:35,384 --> 00:13:38,554
You're terribly late you know.
Don't you think you better go an dress?

269
00:13:38,555 --> 00:13:39,774
Well it won't take us a minute.

270
00:13:39,982 --> 00:13:41,935
Come on Ace I'll slip
you into something flimsy.

271
00:13:41,936 --> 00:13:42,936
- Will they excuse us?
- I think so.

272
00:13:43,328 --> 00:13:45,940
Officer, get a couple of men.
Get that fish off this deck. Hurry.

273
00:13:51,008 --> 00:13:53,531
He's a riot isn't he. You know
he can go on like that all night.

274
00:13:54,212 --> 00:13:55,212
So I see.

275
00:13:57,239 --> 00:13:59,402
- You're kidding. You really what more?
- Yes.

276
00:13:59,403 --> 00:14:00,403
Gee that Ace is hot tonight isn't he?

277
00:14:01,365 --> 00:14:04,028
Josh is he going to stay
at that piano all evening?

278
00:14:04,128 --> 00:14:06,955
Oh no, he's got some other stuff
he does away from the piano.

279
00:14:06,956 --> 00:14:08,579
He's just limbering up over there.

280
00:14:10,444 --> 00:14:11,467
Hey drums.

281
00:14:16,234 --> 00:14:20,106
<i>A crowd has stormed the music hall.
Won't someone please put in a riot call.</i>

282
00:14:20,213 --> 00:14:22,124
<i>Where's Captain Custard?</i>

283
00:14:22,293 --> 00:14:23,956
Custard!
Custard!

284
00:14:24,001 --> 00:14:25,896
<i>They're milling left.
They're swarming right.</i>

285
00:14:26,056 --> 00:14:28,064
<i>This always happens when
they have bank night.</i>

286
00:14:28,127 --> 00:14:30,326
<i>Where's Captain Custard?</i>

287
00:14:32,000 --> 00:14:35,680
<i>Here's Captain Custard.
Undaltered and unflustered.</i>

288
00:14:35,714 --> 00:14:37,641
<i>With his troops officially mustered.</i>

289
00:14:37,753 --> 00:14:42,895
<i>No ushers are greater,
in any theater in town.</i>

290
00:14:43,763 --> 00:14:47,359
<i>Quick, can't you see sir.
Oh goodness gracious me sir.</i>

291
00:14:47,360 --> 00:14:49,220
<i>Will you look at company B sir.</i>

292
00:14:49,438 --> 00:14:55,102
<i>I think they're retreating.
This bank night is beating them down.</i>

293
00:14:55,269 --> 00:14:59,073
<i>He halts their advances,
with firm and fearless glances.</i>

294
00:14:59,134 --> 00:15:01,068
<i>They shall not pass the center isle.</i>

295
00:15:01,069 --> 00:15:03,485
<i>Because he's armed to the
teeth with a winsome smile.</i>

296
00:15:03,486 --> 00:15:06,894
<i>Oh Captain Custard,
undaltered and unflustered.</i>

297
00:15:06,955 --> 00:15:08,819
<i>And around him woman are clustered.</i>

298
00:15:08,838 --> 00:15:12,671
<i>He know's all their wishes.
They're waiting for dishes.</i>

299
00:15:12,698 --> 00:15:14,794
<i>It's not his uniform,
spic and spruce.</i>

300
00:15:14,795 --> 00:15:17,047
<i>'Cause he looks to much
like a charlot moose.</i>

301
00:15:17,170 --> 00:15:19,111
<i>Oh Captain Cussy.</i>

302
00:15:19,875 --> 00:15:20,841
Sir... Uh Miss?

303
00:15:25,389 --> 00:15:29,799
Do you think some time I could
hire your friend for a stag party?

304
00:15:30,174 --> 00:15:32,432
Ho ho, you gotta take both of us.
We work together.

305
00:15:36,245 --> 00:15:40,150
<i>Oh sir on the QT.
I'm private Tutty Fruity.</i>

306
00:15:40,151 --> 00:15:42,281
<i>And I'm now reportin' for duty.</i>

307
00:15:42,282 --> 00:15:47,326
<i>You'll find while I'm here sir.
No one is fiercer than me.</i>

308
00:15:47,327 --> 00:15:48,271
Attention!

309
00:15:48,272 --> 00:15:52,021
<i>I'm one of those creatures.
Who shines those double features.</i>

310
00:15:52,022 --> 00:15:55,932
<i>My devastating charm will count.
I'm in there pitching for Paramount.</i>

311
00:15:56,768 --> 00:15:59,718
<i>Pardon my stating,
but I'm so captivating...</i>

312
00:15:59,761 --> 00:16:01,998
<i>...that folks won't know
that their waiting.</i>

313
00:16:02,075 --> 00:16:05,776
<i>My hands are defeated,
piles all one seated.</i>

314
00:16:05,777 --> 00:16:07,920
<i>I've got more metals across my chest</i>

315
00:16:07,921 --> 00:16:10,064
<i>than in all west point
or in all points west.</i>

316
00:16:10,065 --> 00:16:11,845
<i>Shoot, toot tabuty.</i>

317
00:16:14,026 --> 00:16:15,745
- Private Tutty Fruity.
- Yes.

318
00:16:15,746 --> 00:16:18,309
I award you the metal of the week,
for finding that lady's pocket book

319
00:16:18,310 --> 00:16:19,328
and returning half the money.

320
00:16:19,329 --> 00:16:20,329
Oh it was nothing at all Captain.

321
00:16:22,242 --> 00:16:23,218
That go with it?

322
00:16:23,219 --> 00:16:25,859
-That's it.
- Oh ho ho, well.

323
00:16:35,008 --> 00:16:36,008
Attention!

324
00:16:38,435 --> 00:16:39,435
Attention!

325
00:16:40,283 --> 00:16:41,283
For bravery.

326
00:16:48,100 --> 00:16:49,100
I'll mail it to you.

327
00:16:50,172 --> 00:16:51,743
Getting a little rough
aren't they Gordon?

328
00:16:57,417 --> 00:16:59,330
- Wow!
- There they go!

329
00:17:02,389 --> 00:17:03,089
What do you want?

330
00:17:03,090 --> 00:17:04,928
Same thing as you but
you're the Captain.

331
00:17:05,020 --> 00:17:06,139
Yeah, well you wouldn't
know how to handle this.

332
00:17:06,140 --> 00:17:06,843
What do you mean?

333
00:17:06,844 --> 00:17:07,803
Well I... Give me you're metals.

334
00:17:07,804 --> 00:17:09,679
Why you Indian giver.
Leave me some ammunition.

335
00:17:09,680 --> 00:17:10,809
This is out of you're department.

336
00:17:11,025 --> 00:17:12,856
My, it's chilly outside.

337
00:17:13,867 --> 00:17:14,867
(Both) Yes it is.

338
00:17:18,119 --> 00:17:20,433
(Both) <i>Oh Captain Custard...</i>

339
00:17:29,837 --> 00:17:30,837
Watch.

340
00:17:35,480 --> 00:17:36,480
What is it bank night?

341
00:17:43,625 --> 00:17:44,625
What's that for?

342
00:17:46,701 --> 00:17:49,174
To buy your self a hand organ.

343
00:17:50,761 --> 00:17:52,908
And a red hat for your monkey.

344
00:17:53,309 --> 00:17:54,038
Me?

345
00:17:54,214 --> 00:17:55,704
Let's show him that
other little number we do.

346
00:17:55,705 --> 00:17:56,640
Oh yeah.

347
00:17:56,878 --> 00:17:59,291
Patty-cake patty-cake
bakers man...

348
00:17:59,356 --> 00:18:01,485
bake a cake as fast as you...

349
00:18:41,706 --> 00:18:43,891
He's made us the laughing
stock of the whole country.

350
00:18:43,892 --> 00:18:46,758
I demand a public apology.
You've got to bring him back here.

351
00:18:46,759 --> 00:18:50,213
Back from where?
All we know is this.

352
00:19:01,026 --> 00:19:01,851
What's this?

353
00:19:01,852 --> 00:19:05,072
The gentleman on the right
is your prospective son-in-law.

354
00:19:11,678 --> 00:19:12,566
Yes Mr. Mallon?

355
00:19:12,567 --> 00:19:15,721
I want a listing of every ship that
left Honolulu in the past three weeks.

356
00:19:15,722 --> 00:19:16,722
Yes sir.

357
00:19:17,233 --> 00:19:18,791
You've got to bring him back on
his hands and knees

358
00:19:18,792 --> 00:19:20,349
even if you've got to
break his neck to do it.

359
00:19:20,350 --> 00:19:22,328
Now wait a minute,
what are you getting excited for?

360
00:19:22,329 --> 00:19:24,985
I'm the only one that should be excited
and I'm perfectly calm.

361
00:19:25,445 --> 00:19:26,699
He can't have gone very far.

362
00:19:26,700 --> 00:19:29,215
Unless he's fallen overboard,
which is too much to hope for.

363
00:19:29,216 --> 00:19:31,023
He must be somewhere on there.

364
00:20:15,455 --> 00:20:16,455
Well there she goes.

365
00:20:17,092 --> 00:20:18,324
And here we are.

366
00:20:19,879 --> 00:20:23,823
And as our ship of dreams
sails into the golden sunset.

367
00:20:24,557 --> 00:20:26,711
Leaving the magic isle of Kaigoon.

368
00:20:26,712 --> 00:20:30,942
And the rover boys in peace and quiet,
far far from the work a day world.

369
00:20:31,995 --> 00:20:34,956
Da da da datda....

370
00:20:40,551 --> 00:20:42,233
That washes up Gloria and Cherry.

371
00:20:42,234 --> 00:20:44,339
Ohhhh, do you realize how close
I came to getting hooked?

372
00:20:44,340 --> 00:20:47,501
Say me too. We gotta agree on
something right now, no more woman.

373
00:20:47,502 --> 00:20:49,897
No woman of any kind,
size, shape, or color.

374
00:20:49,898 --> 00:20:51,332
Not even midgets.

375
00:20:51,333 --> 00:20:53,655
Why if either one of us even looks
at anything in a skirt

376
00:20:53,656 --> 00:20:54,817
the other can clip his ears off

377
00:20:54,818 --> 00:20:55,978
and stuff them down his throat.

378
00:20:55,979 --> 00:20:57,113
And I hope you choke.

379
00:20:57,114 --> 00:20:58,712
How you gonna look streamlined?

380
00:21:05,143 --> 00:21:06,143
Hey, get a load of this.

381
00:21:06,658 --> 00:21:08,589
Marvelous invention.
Should be one in every home.

382
00:21:08,590 --> 00:21:09,590
That's a tropical incinerator.

383
00:21:11,063 --> 00:21:12,063
How 'bout this huh?

384
00:21:13,885 --> 00:21:15,511
Why it's soft as goofa feathers.

385
00:21:15,808 --> 00:21:17,456
Who wrote that song "This is the life"?

386
00:21:17,457 --> 00:21:19,119
Say this is the joint
we've been looking for.

387
00:21:19,120 --> 00:21:20,120
I don't know how you're gonna beat it.

388
00:21:20,121 --> 00:21:21,860
You just lay around out in the hot sun,

389
00:21:21,861 --> 00:21:23,596
reach up with one
hand and get a coconut,

390
00:21:23,597 --> 00:21:25,292
throw a hook out the
window and you get a fish.

391
00:21:25,892 --> 00:21:27,309
How much you holdin' there bubbles?

392
00:21:27,409 --> 00:21:29,033
We're loaded chum, $1.28.

393
00:21:29,069 --> 00:21:30,507
- One two eight.
- Net.

394
00:21:30,708 --> 00:21:33,220
Well that should be enough to light
a fire under a couple of short beers.

395
00:21:33,221 --> 00:21:35,685
- Are you ready?
- Comin' comin'.

396
00:21:37,340 --> 00:21:38,340
Five.

397
00:21:39,520 --> 00:21:41,925
Ho ho, this one's on you my friend.

398
00:21:43,447 --> 00:21:44,742
- Cut.
- Wait a minute.

399
00:21:51,388 --> 00:21:52,505
Well what's cookin'?

400
00:22:48,308 --> 00:22:49,308
Bravo!

401
00:22:51,785 --> 00:22:53,640
I think he wants her
to give up cigarettes.

402
00:22:53,641 --> 00:22:54,341
Yeah.

403
00:23:06,136 --> 00:23:08,512
Nix. You what that dude
to snap out your front rack?

404
00:23:08,513 --> 00:23:10,098
You don't think I'm
afraid of him do ya'?

405
00:23:11,584 --> 00:23:12,584
I am.

406
00:23:56,237 --> 00:23:57,237
Why you...

407
00:24:35,333 --> 00:24:36,691
How 'bout gettin' up there junior?

408
00:24:37,154 --> 00:24:38,154
Come on.

409
00:24:40,959 --> 00:24:41,959
Get up!

410
00:24:51,574 --> 00:24:52,574
What's the matter?

411
00:24:53,602 --> 00:24:54,602
It's on side saddle.

412
00:24:54,841 --> 00:24:55,841
Oh I'll fix that.

413
00:24:58,850 --> 00:24:59,850
How's that?

414
00:24:59,851 --> 00:25:00,851
Better.

415
00:25:01,216 --> 00:25:02,216
Thanks.

416
00:25:04,111 --> 00:25:05,354
How 'bout a little breakfast?

417
00:25:05,355 --> 00:25:06,355
Wouldn't hurt.

418
00:25:08,637 --> 00:25:09,891
Hey, why don't you let her get it?

419
00:25:12,232 --> 00:25:13,535
That's not a bad idea.

420
00:25:16,337 --> 00:25:17,337
Come on get up!

421
00:25:18,328 --> 00:25:19,238
Hey!

422
00:25:20,223 --> 00:25:21,726
She's a sound sleeper this kid.

423
00:25:28,414 --> 00:25:29,515
She's gone!

424
00:25:29,516 --> 00:25:30,516
- Gone?
- Yeah.

425
00:25:38,012 --> 00:25:39,012
I though so.

426
00:25:39,196 --> 00:25:42,405
My knife. Our money. Forty two cents.
It's gone!

427
00:25:42,960 --> 00:25:43,960
My watch!

428
00:25:44,373 --> 00:25:45,947
My grandfathers watch!

429
00:25:46,522 --> 00:25:48,920
We're clean.
She didn't leave us change of a match.

430
00:25:49,425 --> 00:25:51,883
Well, serves us right
for gettin' mixed up with a dame.

431
00:25:55,851 --> 00:25:56,792
Where'd she go?

432
00:25:56,793 --> 00:25:58,392
I tell you Cesar I do not know.

433
00:25:58,393 --> 00:25:59,393
Come on tell me!
Where is she?

434
00:25:59,394 --> 00:26:01,492
Every thing I know
I have already tell you.

435
00:26:01,493 --> 00:26:03,114
She has gone with the Americans!

436
00:26:19,053 --> 00:26:20,053
Good morning to you.

437
00:26:26,699 --> 00:26:27,659
Where's my knife?

438
00:26:28,205 --> 00:26:29,205
Right here.

439
00:26:29,438 --> 00:26:31,798
I tried to sell it
but the man he laughed.

440
00:26:31,848 --> 00:26:32,848
Well where's my watch?

441
00:26:34,075 --> 00:26:35,075
Right here.

442
00:26:35,076 --> 00:26:36,770
That was my grandfather's watch.

443
00:26:36,771 --> 00:26:37,828
Could you eat it?

444
00:26:37,863 --> 00:26:40,270
Well no. But you can't go
around takin' things like that.

445
00:26:40,271 --> 00:26:41,715
Why don't you ask us
when you want somethin'?

446
00:26:43,204 --> 00:26:44,497
Did ya buy this too?

447
00:26:44,688 --> 00:26:47,549
No I got that from where I
used to live. This is mine.

448
00:26:47,550 --> 00:26:48,716
Well then why didn't you hock that,

449
00:26:48,717 --> 00:26:50,480
instead of hockin'
my grandfather's watch?

450
00:26:50,481 --> 00:26:53,781
Because in Kaigoon you do not need
a watch. This we may need.

451
00:26:58,924 --> 00:27:00,917
There is a spring in the forest.
Go and get some water.

452
00:27:04,135 --> 00:27:05,089
Go on.

453
00:27:08,943 --> 00:27:11,222
- And you can build a fire.
- Huh?

454
00:27:11,223 --> 00:27:13,077
You'll find firewood right out side.

455
00:27:14,041 --> 00:27:15,041
Go ahead, hurry up.

456
00:28:30,948 --> 00:28:34,087
<i>When shadows fall...</i>

457
00:28:34,662 --> 00:28:39,074
<i>...and the night is dark and deep...</i>

458
00:28:39,379 --> 00:28:45,686
<i>...I've a randevú that I must keep...</i>

459
00:28:46,593 --> 00:28:53,454
<i>...or my poor heart would not sleep.</i>

460
00:29:00,106 --> 00:29:04,037
<i>I have two friends...</i>

461
00:29:04,284 --> 00:29:08,147
<i>...the strangest company...</i>

462
00:29:08,827 --> 00:29:16,497
<i>...the gay light harvest moon
and the willow tree.</i>

463
00:29:16,961 --> 00:29:21,874
<i>The sad willow tree.</i>

464
00:29:23,233 --> 00:29:27,370
<i>And when we meet...</i>

465
00:29:27,648 --> 00:29:32,100
<i>...I notice suddenly...</i>

466
00:29:32,101 --> 00:29:40,130
<i>...the moonlight begins to smile.
But the willow tree...</i>

467
00:29:40,371 --> 00:29:45,676
<i>...starts weeping for me.</i>

468
00:29:46,618 --> 00:29:53,160
<i>Somehow I know it's about my love.</i>

469
00:29:53,235 --> 00:29:57,991
<i>The willow must doubt my love...</i>

470
00:29:58,162 --> 00:30:06,021
<i>...will ever appear.
And yet...</i>

471
00:30:06,241 --> 00:30:15,189
<i>...the moon seems to say
my love will soon be here.</i>

472
00:30:15,455 --> 00:30:23,480
<i>Which one is right?
They never quite agree.</i>

473
00:30:23,788 --> 00:30:28,380
<i>The smiling moon...</i>

474
00:30:28,433 --> 00:30:36,546
<i>...and the weeping willow tree.</i>

475
00:30:38,790 --> 00:30:42,292
<i>Da da da dee</i>

476
00:30:42,293 --> 00:30:47,387
<i>Da da da da da do</i>

477
00:30:47,764 --> 00:30:55,121
<i>La da da de de de do do do</i>

478
00:30:56,951 --> 00:30:57,951
Where you going?

479
00:30:57,952 --> 00:31:01,090
Oh I... I need some air.

480
00:31:01,091 --> 00:31:03,974
The night air's bad for you junior.
Back in the net.

481
00:31:03,975 --> 00:31:04,675
Yeah.

482
00:31:38,442 --> 00:31:41,857
<i>The smiling moon...</i>

483
00:31:42,396 --> 00:31:45,159
<i>...and the weeping...</i>

484
00:31:46,087 --> 00:31:51,247
<i>...willow tree.</i>

485
00:32:07,420 --> 00:32:08,367
Momma.

486
00:32:10,592 --> 00:32:11,520
Where is Mima?

487
00:32:11,777 --> 00:32:13,736
- She come and get her cloths.
- Where'd she go?

488
00:32:14,196 --> 00:32:15,561
She do not tell me.

489
00:32:16,103 --> 00:32:17,981
If she comes back find
out where she lives.

490
00:32:18,270 --> 00:32:20,911
And uh...
do not say I have been her.

491
00:32:21,752 --> 00:32:22,452
Thank you.

492
00:32:25,556 --> 00:32:27,601
Well you've certainly had
a busy life alright.

493
00:32:31,009 --> 00:32:31,709
Yes.

494
00:32:32,577 --> 00:32:33,870
And my father...

495
00:32:34,773 --> 00:32:36,822
...he had so much life in him.

496
00:32:37,108 --> 00:32:38,425
The way he laugh...

497
00:32:39,056 --> 00:32:41,416
...it made people feel
good just to be near him.

498
00:32:41,417 --> 00:32:42,417
What was your mother like?

499
00:32:42,703 --> 00:32:44,804
Aw, she was very beautiful.

500
00:32:45,338 --> 00:32:46,338
She was a dancer.

501
00:32:46,769 --> 00:32:50,081
My father met her in Algeres
and they were married that very day.

502
00:32:51,162 --> 00:32:53,751
Well I mean where uh...
When did he uh...

503
00:32:53,752 --> 00:32:55,308
My father was killed.

504
00:32:56,505 --> 00:32:58,708
My mother did not live
so long afterwords.

505
00:33:00,240 --> 00:33:01,483
Aw, that's tough.

506
00:33:03,068 --> 00:33:05,989
How'd ya happen to get mixed up
with this uh... Cesar fella?

507
00:33:06,128 --> 00:33:10,190
Well, after my father died my
mother had a very hard time.

508
00:33:10,915 --> 00:33:12,585
She worked for Cesar.

509
00:33:13,105 --> 00:33:14,483
I think he was in love with her.

510
00:33:15,052 --> 00:33:16,683
Then after she was gone, I...

511
00:33:16,783 --> 00:33:19,439
just kept on with him because
I did not know anything else.

512
00:33:19,602 --> 00:33:21,979
It was alright while I was young but...

513
00:33:22,837 --> 00:33:25,395
...now, the way Cesar acts...

514
00:33:26,106 --> 00:33:28,373
I think that it is good
that I'm away from him.

515
00:33:33,071 --> 00:33:34,567
D'ya think she's workin' on us?

516
00:33:34,568 --> 00:33:35,959
How do you mean workin' on us?

517
00:33:35,960 --> 00:33:37,474
Well you know, with
that cookin' and that

518
00:33:37,475 --> 00:33:39,969
routine about her father
and mother. What is that?

519
00:33:39,970 --> 00:33:40,970
Yeah, how 'bout that.

520
00:33:41,256 --> 00:33:43,701
Movin' in and taken charge.
She's gettin' kind of clubby.

521
00:33:43,702 --> 00:33:46,569
She's really dreamin' it up.
What's she want?

522
00:33:46,570 --> 00:33:49,234
- It's got me worried.
- Me too.

523
00:33:49,530 --> 00:33:52,526
First thing we know she'll be gettin'
our slippers, sending out the laundry,

524
00:33:52,527 --> 00:33:53,950
and lightin' my pipe.

525
00:33:54,325 --> 00:33:56,635
Yeah.
Shh, break it up.

526
00:34:08,125 --> 00:34:09,552
There, that is better.

527
00:34:10,478 --> 00:34:11,478
See what I mean?

528
00:34:23,839 --> 00:34:24,839
What are you doin'?

529
00:34:25,126 --> 00:34:27,529
I must keep the place
clean for you two.

530
00:34:28,283 --> 00:34:29,784
Yeah well you cleaned
me out pretty good.

531
00:34:29,785 --> 00:34:31,285
You cleaned me out of watches.

532
00:34:32,341 --> 00:34:35,409
Well you will get your watch back
as soon as you go to work.

533
00:34:36,079 --> 00:34:37,760
- Work!?
- Work!?

534
00:34:43,013 --> 00:34:44,079
Listen fellas...

535
00:34:45,034 --> 00:34:47,862
I just want you to stand
and admire me for a while.

536
00:34:47,863 --> 00:34:50,254
I just got an idea that's
going to make us a fortune.

537
00:34:50,255 --> 00:34:51,883
I don't know how I do it.

538
00:34:51,884 --> 00:34:53,359
- Well what have you got?
- Soap.

539
00:34:53,531 --> 00:34:54,896
Soap and water that's what I got.

540
00:34:55,084 --> 00:34:57,222
And some stuff a guy in a
medicine show told me about.

541
00:34:57,374 --> 00:34:59,581
Now all you fellas have to
do is get me some bottles.

542
00:34:59,616 --> 00:35:01,359
Any kind of bottles.
Just get me bottles.

543
00:35:01,432 --> 00:35:02,255
- Bottles?
- Bottles.

544
00:35:02,256 --> 00:35:04,854
Big bottles, small bottles.
Pints, quarts, Bottles.

545
00:35:09,400 --> 00:35:11,351
- Help!
- Why if I ever get to you...

546
00:35:11,352 --> 00:35:12,352
Help!

547
00:35:12,583 --> 00:35:13,888
Hey! What's the matter?

548
00:35:14,092 --> 00:35:15,092
- What's the matter?
- What's the matter?

549
00:35:15,363 --> 00:35:17,138
- Why she's got it.
- I have not!

550
00:35:17,139 --> 00:35:19,443
Yes you have.
You know what she's got.

551
00:35:19,444 --> 00:35:20,577
- What has she got!?
- What has she got!?

552
00:35:20,578 --> 00:35:21,867
- Yes!
- She's got...

553
00:35:22,034 --> 00:35:27,043
<i>An apple for the teacher
will always do the trick.</i>

554
00:35:27,044 --> 00:35:28,588
- That's enough. That's enough.
- The suckers are in.

555
00:35:28,589 --> 00:35:31,261
Now folks we will regale
you with a slight song.

556
00:35:31,833 --> 00:35:33,974
- Will you vamp me brother?
- One vamp coming up.

557
00:35:40,829 --> 00:35:44,510
<i>Do you remember Cuba
who played on the tuba.</i>

558
00:35:44,733 --> 00:35:47,476
<i>And made the rumba such a popular beat.</i>

559
00:35:47,477 --> 00:35:50,710
<i>The old peanut vendor
was a solid sender.</i>

560
00:35:51,088 --> 00:35:53,626
<i>Not to mention Piccolo Peat.</i>

561
00:35:53,627 --> 00:35:59,266
<i>Of course you've heard of Sammy,
from Alabamy. That old accordion man.</i>

562
00:36:00,005 --> 00:36:05,448
<i>Well while we're on the subject,
do you know how the begin began.</i>

563
00:36:06,474 --> 00:36:08,721
<i>Music soothes the savage.</i>

564
00:36:09,357 --> 00:36:11,781
<i>That's the well-known phrase.</i>

565
00:36:11,782 --> 00:36:18,096
<i>But you're heart becomes full of kettle
drum when the sweet potato piper plays.</i>

566
00:36:18,731 --> 00:36:21,071
<i>Go on, throw your hats up.</i>

567
00:36:21,892 --> 00:36:24,243
<i>Shout a few hoorays.</i>

568
00:36:24,244 --> 00:36:27,489
<i>'Cause you can't hold back
you're just a j-j-jumpin' jack</i>

569
00:36:27,490 --> 00:36:30,380
<i>when the sweet potato piper plays.</i>

570
00:36:30,808 --> 00:36:32,351
<i>Though it's not a magic flute.</i>

571
00:36:33,931 --> 00:36:35,560
<i>There's a fascinatin' toot.</i>

572
00:36:37,142 --> 00:36:39,900
<i>It's not exactly beautiful</i>

573
00:36:39,901 --> 00:36:43,432
<i>it's sort of like oh I don't
know I guess you'd call it cute.</i>

574
00:36:43,601 --> 00:36:49,066
<i>Sunbeams try new dance steps.
Song birds sound their "A"s.</i>

575
00:36:49,328 --> 00:36:52,328
<i>And the world joins in
with a g-great big grin</i>

576
00:36:52,329 --> 00:36:55,595
<i>when the sweet potato piper plays.
Play it piper.</i>

577
00:36:58,443 --> 00:36:59,443
Well yes.

578
00:37:00,378 --> 00:37:01,378
Naturally.

579
00:37:04,650 --> 00:37:08,279
<i>When the sweet potato piper plays.</i>
Piper.

580
00:37:17,970 --> 00:37:18,989
Get me out of this.

581
00:37:58,334 --> 00:38:03,427
<i>Sunbeams try new dance steps.
Song birds sound their "A"s.</i>

582
00:38:03,428 --> 00:38:06,538
<i>And the world joins in
with a great big grin</i>

583
00:38:06,539 --> 00:38:09,352
<i>when the sweet potato piper plays.</i>

584
00:38:09,792 --> 00:38:11,055
Now ladies and gentlemen,

585
00:38:11,056 --> 00:38:14,107
my little associate here has an item
that he wishes to describe to you.

586
00:38:14,108 --> 00:38:15,794
It contains no grit, grime, nor grease.

587
00:38:15,795 --> 00:38:18,283
Made from bark, roots, herbs,
and berries. Tell them butch.

588
00:38:18,284 --> 00:38:20,133
And now folks for your kind indulgence

589
00:38:20,134 --> 00:38:22,098
I want to introduce
"Spotto" the miracle worker.

590
00:38:22,099 --> 00:38:25,584

blemishes of all kinds and descriptions.

591
00:38:25,585 --> 00:38:28,214
And will make your
cloths the color of snow.

592
00:38:28,215 --> 00:38:30,875
Pure as the driven snow.
You folks all know what snow is.

593
00:38:32,877 --> 00:38:35,094
No, I guess you don't.
No, I guess you don't.

594
00:38:35,095 --> 00:38:36,950
Who will take the first bottle
ladies and gentlemen?

595
00:38:36,951 --> 00:38:39,173
I'm going to pass among you so that
you can inspect it more closely.

596
00:38:39,174 --> 00:38:41,396
There you are sir,
"Spotto" the miracle worker.

597
00:38:41,616 --> 00:38:43,107
This is a very special offer friends.

598
00:38:43,108 --> 00:38:44,847
The dollar bottle that has
been selling for 50 cents...

599
00:38:44,848 --> 00:38:46,606
- 50 Cents!

600
00:38:46,607 --> 00:38:47,801

603
00:38:51,812 --> 00:38:53,753
- An old beat-up yam.

604
00:38:53,754 --> 00:38:55,065
We're gonna make a fortune alright.

605
00:38:55,066 --> 00:38:57,402
Now wait a minute. Wait.
Don't sell another bottle.

606
00:38:57,403 --> 00:38:58,110
Just a second.

607
00:38:58,111 --> 00:39:01,415
I have one more attractive offer
to make before we close up here.

608
00:39:01,416 --> 00:39:02,116
Yes sir.

609
00:39:02,117 --> 00:39:04,531
Yes sir, I'm going to remove any
spot in the crowd free of charge.

610
00:39:04,532 --> 00:39:05,814
- A demonstration.
- That's it.

611
00:39:05,815 --> 00:39:09,049
- Now if somebody will just walk in...
- Yes and we get the... Ahhh...

612
00:39:09,050 --> 00:39:10,332
There's just your man.

613
00:39:12,399 --> 00:39:13,950
- There's you man.
- Yes sir.

614
00:39:13,951 --> 00:39:15,746

615
00:39:15,747 --> 00:39:17,393
- Oh now wait a minute.
- Come on now come back.

616
00:39:17,394 --> 00:39:18,966
Where's your broom my good man?

617
00:39:19,219 --> 00:39:20,219
Tell me have you any spots?

618
00:39:21,112 --> 00:39:22,367
Only when I open my eyes.

619
00:39:22,368 --> 00:39:24,117
Oh now come come,
you must have a spot somewhere.

620
00:39:24,118 --> 00:39:26,020
Ah yes,
what is this little blemish here?

621
00:39:26,318 --> 00:39:28,182
That sailor boys, is my mustache.

622
00:39:28,183 --> 00:39:30,158
Oh ho ho,
you ought to cut a fire break in it.

623
00:39:30,159 --> 00:39:31,920
Absolutely, is that your mustache?

624
00:39:31,921 --> 00:39:34,271
Tell me does your chest ever
get jealous of your upper lip?

625
00:39:34,413 --> 00:39:37,157
Ah a mighty pretty thing.
A mighty prett...

626
00:39:37,554 --> 00:39:40,125
Ah there's a spot!
Right there.

627
00:39:41,018 --> 00:39:43,791
Disgusting isn't it.
Well I go.

628
00:39:43,792 --> 00:39:45,688
- Oh no.
- Not with our spot you don't.

629
00:39:45,689 --> 00:39:47,334
Well the spot she stays but I go!

630
00:39:47,335 --> 00:39:49,213
- Oh now wait a minute.
- Come right up here.

631
00:39:49,279 --> 00:39:51,091
We're not going to harm you.
Here you are.

632
00:39:51,092 --> 00:39:53,199
Now watch this folks,
an amazing demonstration.

633
00:39:53,200 --> 00:39:56,913
Now if you'll just cast you're...
Uh uh, ixnay ixnay your over doing it.

634
00:39:57,687 --> 00:39:59,076
Breaking in a new assistant.

635
00:39:59,077 --> 00:40:01,136
But don't worry brother there'll
be no extra charge.

636
00:40:01,137 --> 00:40:03,947
Now watch closely folks,
I'll have it gone like that.

637
00:40:03,948 --> 00:40:05,404
That's a pretty bad little spot.
How'd that happen?

638
00:40:05,928 --> 00:40:07,566
- Well I was just...
- Don't tell me, is it ink?

639
00:40:07,810 --> 00:40:09,514
No it couldn't be ink. He's have
to be able to write for that.

640
00:40:09,515 --> 00:40:10,670
Tell me is it soup?

641
00:40:10,671 --> 00:40:12,053
No, but you're getting hot.

642
00:40:13,463 --> 00:40:16,162
It bubbles a little but it
will quiet right down.

643
00:40:16,263 --> 00:40:18,721
Egads! It's alive!

644
00:40:18,867 --> 00:40:20,722
Ah nothing to worry about.
I'll have it out...

645
00:40:21,514 --> 00:40:22,514
Just like that.

646
00:40:22,515 --> 00:40:24,795
Ah look folks, look, "Spotto".
That's "Spotto"...

647
00:40:24,796 --> 00:40:27,135
...the housewife's friend,
the workingman's delight.

648
00:40:27,253 --> 00:40:29,436
Look at that, just like a platinum blond

649
00:40:29,437 --> 00:40:31,619
riding aboard a white
horse to a flock of swans.

650
00:40:31,620 --> 00:40:34,535
What am I gonna do
with all this lather!?

651
00:40:34,536 --> 00:40:35,706
Oh there's nothing to worry about.

652
00:40:35,707 --> 00:40:38,505
If nobody claims it in 30 days,
brother it's yours.

653
00:40:38,506 --> 00:40:39,919
Oh well yes that's alright,

654
00:40:39,920 --> 00:40:42,380
You never have to be alarmed
about starto "Spotto"...

655
00:40:42,381 --> 00:40:44,318
Have you got it there
we're taking it on the lamb.

656
00:40:44,319 --> 00:40:46,640
Alright now, just stand by.

657
00:40:46,641 --> 00:40:48,961
I'll just clean off that
little spot right here.

658
00:40:49,142 --> 00:40:51,063
There you are my friend.
There you are.

659
00:40:51,163 --> 00:40:54,086
Just like I told you.
No brush, no lather, no spot.

660
00:40:56,266 --> 00:40:57,396
No coat!

661
00:40:59,430 --> 00:41:01,125
Alright, so I ain't neat.

662
00:41:01,492 --> 00:41:05,546
Fake.
Fake! Fake! Fake!

663
00:41:05,590 --> 00:41:08,074
Fine thing, why didn't you try
out that stuff before you used it?

664
00:41:08,075 --> 00:41:09,474
I did once before in Brooklyn.

665
00:41:09,475 --> 00:41:10,769
- What happened?
- Same thing.

666
00:41:41,084 --> 00:41:50,549
<i>Ohhhh, carry me back to old Virginny.</i>

667
00:41:54,020 --> 00:42:02,979
<i>Ohhhh, there's where the cotton,
and the corn, and the taters grow.</i>

668
00:42:02,980 --> 00:42:05,322
Stop it!
Stop it!

669
00:42:05,323 --> 00:42:08,850
I've got work to do and you're
making a nuisance of your self.

670
00:42:08,851 --> 00:42:11,206
Ah yes, and I'm doing an
awfully good job of it too.

671
00:42:12,148 --> 00:42:14,428
I'm going to report you to the police.

672
00:42:14,709 --> 00:42:15,709
Where's Mr. Willow?

673
00:42:19,079 --> 00:42:23,371
To me your whole attitude is abdominal.
I'm sure that's not the word I mean.

674
00:42:25,742 --> 00:42:26,442
Mr. Willow?

675
00:42:30,649 --> 00:42:33,861
It's from the home office.
Direct to me.

676
00:42:34,075 --> 00:42:35,601
Probably that you're fired.

677
00:42:37,663 --> 00:42:39,378
Well come on, what does it say?

678
00:42:39,471 --> 00:42:40,764
None of your business.

679
00:42:43,184 --> 00:42:44,184
It's confidential.

680
00:42:44,984 --> 00:42:46,525
That face!
Who is that face?

681
00:42:46,660 --> 00:42:48,252
Mr. Mallon's son.

682
00:42:48,253 --> 00:42:51,451
- He's missing.
- Missing!? He's here in Kiagoon.

683
00:42:51,452 --> 00:42:53,912
Oh that's ridiculous.
How could he be in Kiagoon?

684
00:42:53,913 --> 00:42:55,947
How could he be in Kiagoon?
Listen...

685
00:42:56,649 --> 00:42:59,438
...I'm walking down the street.
This fellow grabs me.

686
00:42:59,439 --> 00:43:02,713
He takes me by the coat.
I struggle, but I can not get away.

687
00:43:02,714 --> 00:43:04,870
He pulls me.
He pulls me!

688
00:43:04,871 --> 00:43:06,721
- Alright he's here but let me go.
- He takes me...

689
00:43:06,960 --> 00:43:09,238
Then he throws some stuff on me.

690
00:43:09,462 --> 00:43:13,536
He rubs, and rubs, and rubs, and rubs,

691
00:43:13,537 --> 00:43:17,611
and scrubs, and scrubs,
and scrubs, and scrubs!

692
00:43:18,276 --> 00:43:20,925
And that's how I know he's in Kaigoon.

693
00:43:27,188 --> 00:43:30,826
Ace, this is for cigarettes.

694
00:43:32,157 --> 00:43:33,157
Thank you.

695
00:43:35,249 --> 00:43:38,565
No Josh, no.
Do not nail them up.

696
00:43:38,857 --> 00:43:42,124
Just put them over the pole.
That is what it is for.

697
00:43:46,819 --> 00:43:49,332
You know that is part of the stove too.

698
00:43:52,294 --> 00:43:53,791
Ou ohhh.

699
00:43:56,105 --> 00:43:58,724
Well that did it!
That's the last straw!

700
00:43:59,599 --> 00:44:00,529
Me too!

701
00:44:01,225 --> 00:44:02,604
"This is for cigarettes Ace."

702
00:44:02,605 --> 00:44:06,138
Better wash the dishes boys.
Fetch the water, chop the wood.

703
00:44:06,139 --> 00:44:07,139
What are we robots?

704
00:44:07,474 --> 00:44:10,031
Why this is worse than being married.
Only we're not married.

705
00:44:11,113 --> 00:44:12,213
If we had a wife well...

706
00:44:12,408 --> 00:44:15,035
Well we'd have a wife instead
of cauliflower thumbs.

707
00:44:15,272 --> 00:44:17,924
Yeah, we'll probably wind up
with housemaid's knees.

708
00:44:18,650 --> 00:44:19,529
That'd be cute.

709
00:44:19,750 --> 00:44:21,185
Yeah, and if you say anything to her

710
00:44:21,186 --> 00:44:23,675
she looks sad at you with those
big eyes and you're cooked.

711
00:44:24,302 --> 00:44:26,201
- Well she's gotta go.
- Yeah.

712
00:44:27,359 --> 00:44:31,305
Well I'll call her in here and...
and you tell her.

713
00:44:31,949 --> 00:44:33,751
What's a matter with you?
You tell her.

714
00:44:34,897 --> 00:44:37,646
Well... I'll call her in
and we'll both tell her.

715
00:44:37,647 --> 00:44:39,423
- Alright.
- Mima!

716
00:44:41,434 --> 00:44:42,321
Hey Mima!

717
00:44:44,222 --> 00:44:45,475
Yes? What is it?

718
00:44:45,503 --> 00:44:47,772
- Ace, please.
- Oh I'm s...

719
00:44:48,550 --> 00:44:49,713
Did you want me?

720
00:44:49,776 --> 00:44:51,975
Uh... Ace has got
something to tell you yeah.

721
00:44:55,975 --> 00:44:57,519
Yeah well... uh... Mima we...

722
00:44:58,006 --> 00:45:00,034
We been talkin' it over here and ah...

723
00:45:00,881 --> 00:45:03,722
Wel... Well you know we're
just a couple of regular guys an an....

724
00:45:03,723 --> 00:45:05,453
This... this prettying up...

725
00:45:05,454 --> 00:45:08,481
Yeah you know we... The place is good
enough for us the way it used to be.

726
00:45:08,482 --> 00:45:09,681
- Don't ya think so.
- Yeah.

727
00:45:09,682 --> 00:45:12,183
- Oh well if you do not like this.
- Oh no that's...

728
00:45:12,184 --> 00:45:13,951
Oh it's not exactly that its...

729
00:45:13,952 --> 00:45:16,524
Oh I don't know Mima,
it just don't seem to work out.

730
00:45:16,525 --> 00:45:19,348
No, that's it, it's just...
It's just not workin' out. This stuff.

731
00:45:19,349 --> 00:45:22,270
You know a couple of fellas
like us we like to come an go and...

732
00:45:22,425 --> 00:45:25,163
And having a girl around
all the time why it's...

733
00:45:25,164 --> 00:45:27,424
It's sort of off the elbow or
something I don't know it isn't...

734
00:45:27,425 --> 00:45:30,772
Oh you mean...
You want me to leave.

735
00:45:30,773 --> 00:45:33,564
Well... That's the general idea. Yea...

736
00:45:34,637 --> 00:45:35,546
Oh...

737
00:45:36,870 --> 00:45:37,709
I see.

738
00:45:41,485 --> 00:45:42,264
Well...

739
00:45:54,999 --> 00:45:57,060
I was cooking these beans a new way.

740
00:45:58,763 --> 00:46:01,340
You must keep adding water,
or they will burn.

741
00:46:08,261 --> 00:46:09,404
I think she's leavin'.

742
00:46:09,605 --> 00:46:11,471
Well that was the idea.
You wanted her to go didn't ya'?

743
00:46:11,472 --> 00:46:12,700
Well you wanted her to go didn't ya'?

744
00:46:12,701 --> 00:46:15,209
- Well she's goin'.
- Alright, she's goin'.

745
00:46:22,023 --> 00:46:22,723
Well...

746
00:46:24,003 --> 00:46:25,569
there is nothing else to say.

747
00:46:28,180 --> 00:46:29,180
Good bye.

748
00:46:29,587 --> 00:46:33,148
It's not exactly good bye.
We'll be seein' you around.

749
00:46:33,290 --> 00:46:34,561
Yeah, we'll see you around.

750
00:46:40,703 --> 00:46:42,570
- This is for cigarettes.
- Yeah.

751
00:46:44,078 --> 00:46:46,123
Now let's spread out
and get back in the mood.

752
00:46:49,141 --> 00:46:51,447
You know, I thought I handled
that pretty well. Didn't you?

753
00:46:52,789 --> 00:46:53,489
You did what?

754
00:46:53,577 --> 00:46:55,651
I handled the situation
here pretty well.

755
00:46:55,914 --> 00:46:56,914
This situation?

756
00:46:56,915 --> 00:46:58,975
- Well what else? Yeah.
- What was I doin' in there?

757
00:46:58,976 --> 00:47:01,287
Well you were weakening I'll tell
you that. I had to back you up.

758
00:47:01,288 --> 00:47:03,150
You were dig you're toe in there
like both the rover boys.

759
00:47:03,151 --> 00:47:06,003
I only gave her the whole idea.
I pack her bags and put her on the bus.

760
00:47:06,004 --> 00:47:08,724
Yeah, but I was the menace.
I was the heavy in the whole piece.

761
00:47:08,725 --> 00:47:10,774
I had my whip right there.
I just gave it to her like that.

762
00:47:10,775 --> 00:47:13,377
But I was the man that really
accomplished the final brush off.

763
00:47:13,378 --> 00:47:15,954
- You want the bow? Take a bow.
- Take a little light bow?

764
00:47:15,955 --> 00:47:19,461
- Tada.
- That's fine. That's fine.

765
00:47:19,462 --> 00:47:20,702
- You did it all.
- I think so.

766
00:47:20,703 --> 00:47:21,995
- I'm snookered again.
- Possibly.

767
00:47:22,606 --> 00:47:24,356
- Thank you very much.
- Thank you, good night.

768
00:47:24,357 --> 00:47:25,357
Leave a call.

769
00:47:32,349 --> 00:47:33,349
Oh, well let's get it.

770
00:47:39,094 --> 00:47:40,904
Come on.
Come on!

771
00:47:41,668 --> 00:47:42,931
Listen I'm not going to argue with you.

772
00:47:45,567 --> 00:47:47,082
I told you you were
coming with me and that...

773
00:48:06,635 --> 00:48:08,214
Well what are you standing there for?

774
00:48:08,314 --> 00:48:10,169
Go on get in the house
and fix those bean.

775
00:48:10,958 --> 00:48:12,158
Didn't you hear what he said?

776
00:48:31,369 --> 00:48:32,950
Say you better wipe off
your feet on this.

777
00:48:54,854 --> 00:48:56,602
- Hey. Hey! Where you going?
- Huh?

778
00:48:56,603 --> 00:48:57,969
I gotta see a man about a job.

779
00:48:57,970 --> 00:48:59,497
- What job?
- Just a job.

780
00:49:08,086 --> 00:49:09,561
What are you doing to
be doing while I'm gone?

781
00:49:09,562 --> 00:49:10,605
Oh I don't know.

782
00:49:11,318 --> 00:49:14,073
- You just stay in the boat huh?
- What for?

783
00:49:16,334 --> 00:49:17,941
'Cause I wanta' know where you are.

784
00:49:18,657 --> 00:49:22,225
Aw don't give me that big baby stare.
Now I've been hearing things.

785
00:49:22,357 --> 00:49:23,202
Hearin' what?

786
00:49:23,203 --> 00:49:24,836
Bout what you been doin' behind my back.

787
00:49:24,837 --> 00:49:27,371
- Like what?
- Like walkin' in the woods with Mima.

788
00:49:27,372 --> 00:49:28,528
Well what's wrong with walkin'?

789
00:49:28,529 --> 00:49:29,747
There ain't nothing wrong with walkin'.

790
00:49:29,748 --> 00:49:31,898
But how about those evenings you
spend on the beach holding her hand?

791
00:49:32,254 --> 00:49:33,263
What hand?

792
00:49:33,264 --> 00:49:35,573
Never mind what hand.
You have been holding it haven't ya'?

793
00:49:35,574 --> 00:49:37,442
Well supposin' I have.
Maybe I gotta.

794
00:49:37,443 --> 00:49:38,720
- Oh you gotta?
- Yeah I gotta.

795
00:49:38,755 --> 00:49:41,248
If I didn't you'd be doin' it.
And you got no resistance.

796
00:49:41,414 --> 00:49:42,765
I can love 'em and leave 'em.

797
00:49:42,766 --> 00:49:44,918
But the minute they look dreamy
at you you send for a preacher.

798
00:49:44,919 --> 00:49:47,762
Yeah and the minute they look dreamy at
you their fathers send for the preacher.

799
00:49:48,262 --> 00:49:50,566
So why don't you just
lay off protecting me huh?

800
00:49:50,567 --> 00:49:52,318
But that's our agreement.
No woman, remember?

801
00:49:52,319 --> 00:49:54,660
Well skip the agreement. See if you
can arrange to stay in the boat.

802
00:49:55,846 --> 00:49:59,212
- What's a matter, don't you trust me?
- No.

803
00:50:09,627 --> 00:50:10,891
Look at these messieur.

804
00:50:11,269 --> 00:50:13,674
- These better than the others?
- Ah Oui, much much.

805
00:50:13,675 --> 00:50:17,080
For any young lady these would
be very elegant messieur.

806
00:50:17,081 --> 00:50:18,054
15 pesocs.

807
00:50:18,055 --> 00:50:20,188
- O.K. Wrap 'em up.
- Ah oui merci.

808
00:50:20,189 --> 00:50:21,216
Wrap 'em up real nice now.

809
00:50:21,217 --> 00:50:22,940
With a lot of ribbon around
them and everything huh.

810
00:50:22,941 --> 00:50:25,181
Oui very nice messieur.
Very nice.

811
00:50:27,265 --> 00:50:30,496
Hey let's put one of these flowers
on top. Lets go first class huh.

812
00:50:43,130 --> 00:50:44,117
Say what are you doin' in here?

813
00:50:44,118 --> 00:50:46,861
Well I... Uh... I was just gettin'
my self a few things.

814
00:50:46,984 --> 00:50:48,493
- Oh yeah?
- Um hm.

815
00:50:49,136 --> 00:50:50,513
How long you been warrin' these?

816
00:50:52,068 --> 00:50:54,581
Alright so you caught me.
Now take a walk will ya'?

817
00:50:55,652 --> 00:50:56,978
Where'd ya' get the dough?

818
00:50:58,408 --> 00:51:00,234
My ring! You hocked my ring.

819
00:51:00,308 --> 00:51:01,795
Well you never looked good in it anyhow.

820
00:51:01,796 --> 00:51:03,900
- There you are messieur.
- Oh thank you. I'll take those.

821
00:51:04,004 --> 00:51:04,910
Say now wait a minute...

822
00:51:05,052 --> 00:51:06,892
- Who's money paid for them?
- Here here...

823
00:51:06,893 --> 00:51:09,503
Aw now come on. Wait a minute.
What is this?

824
00:51:14,779 --> 00:51:17,355
- Let me carry it for a while huh?
- It ain't heave.

825
00:51:18,332 --> 00:51:20,539
Takin' my ring.
That's stealing that's what it is.

826
00:51:20,774 --> 00:51:22,402
Guys go to jail for that.

827
00:51:22,403 --> 00:51:24,449
If you wanted it why didn't you ask me?
I'd of given it to you.

828
00:51:24,450 --> 00:51:27,171
Yeah, you'd give me your
knife too, without askin'.

829
00:51:28,638 --> 00:51:30,178
What are you going to say
when you give it to her?

830
00:51:30,179 --> 00:51:31,588
Oh I'll think of somethin'.

831
00:51:32,554 --> 00:51:35,356
Hey now wait a minute. I know how you
work. What are you going to say to her?

832
00:51:35,357 --> 00:51:37,047
Oh don't worry about me,
I'll think of somethin'.

833
00:51:37,048 --> 00:51:38,893
That's what I'm afraid of.
Get up forward there.

834
00:51:40,430 --> 00:51:41,582
Hey!
Hey!

835
00:51:41,583 --> 00:51:44,530
Hey you double crossin' wolf,
how am I gonna get home?

836
00:51:44,531 --> 00:51:45,765
Aw you'll think of somethin'.

837
00:51:49,020 --> 00:51:49,931
Oh Mima!

838
00:51:50,011 --> 00:51:52,017
- Hello Josh.
- I got a present for ya.

839
00:51:52,661 --> 00:51:54,886
Oh but you shouldn't
have done that Josh.

840
00:51:54,887 --> 00:51:55,587
Oh why not?

841
00:51:56,153 --> 00:51:57,153
Here let me save the flower.

842
00:51:57,573 --> 00:51:59,659
- The way you're wasting money on me.
- Oh we don't need it that bad.

843
00:51:59,660 --> 00:52:01,258
I just hope you like them that's all.

844
00:52:02,035 --> 00:52:02,981
Nice?

845
00:52:03,519 --> 00:52:05,147
Oh their wonderful.

846
00:52:11,150 --> 00:52:12,992
Just wonderful Josh.

847
00:52:14,896 --> 00:52:18,910
Oh, I've never had a pair of
silk stockings in my life before.

848
00:52:18,911 --> 00:52:20,838
Well I had to sort of
guess about the size.

849
00:52:20,839 --> 00:52:22,765
You know, I didn't know
exactly what you wore.

850
00:52:23,318 --> 00:52:24,874
Such pretty colors.

851
00:52:26,970 --> 00:52:28,796
Look how soft and smooth.

852
00:52:28,797 --> 00:52:31,682
Oh, guaranteed not to rip,
run, or bag at the knees.

853
00:52:32,074 --> 00:52:34,425
You and Ace shouldn't have done this.

854
00:52:34,426 --> 00:52:36,708
Ace? He had nothing to do with it.

855
00:52:36,709 --> 00:52:38,930
He said we had no business
spending the money.

856
00:52:39,293 --> 00:52:41,049
He's a nice enough
guy alright, that Ace.

857
00:52:41,050 --> 00:52:42,806
But he's a little on the tight side.

858
00:52:43,242 --> 00:52:44,763
I said why it's only money,

859
00:52:44,764 --> 00:52:47,148
and if Mima what's them I'm gonna
buy them for her. So I bought them.

860
00:52:47,149 --> 00:52:49,383
The most wonderful
present I've ever had.

861
00:52:50,884 --> 00:52:51,884
Where is Ace?

862
00:52:51,885 --> 00:52:55,335
Oh, he'll be along in a minute.
There was a girl he had to see I think.

863
00:52:55,336 --> 00:52:56,336
A girl?

864
00:52:58,227 --> 00:53:00,723
That's Ace,
he's chasing dames all the time.

865
00:53:02,533 --> 00:53:04,732
I did not know Ace was like that.

866
00:53:04,929 --> 00:53:08,523
Oh yes.
With Ace it's a new one every minute.

867
00:53:08,899 --> 00:53:11,858
He'll sit on the beach with them,
and hold hands,

868
00:53:12,070 --> 00:53:14,006
and he'll leave them
flat just like that.

869
00:53:14,832 --> 00:53:16,855
- He will?
- Yes.

870
00:53:16,856 --> 00:53:18,954
I promise you I know this Ace Lannigan.

871
00:53:19,296 --> 00:53:22,567
I know how he works.
And I'm the best friend he's got.

872
00:53:28,171 --> 00:53:36,396
<i>I'm so afraid of night
'cause I'm too romantic.</i>

873
00:53:38,428 --> 00:53:46,676
<i>Moonlight and stars
have made such a fool of me.</i>

874
00:53:49,054 --> 00:53:57,979
<i>You know you're much too near,
and I'm too romantic.</i>

875
00:53:59,679 --> 00:54:06,495
<i>Now wouldn't I look a sight
on a bended knee.</i>

876
00:54:07,920 --> 00:54:11,873
<i>I'm startled when you whisper.</i>

877
00:54:12,361 --> 00:54:16,374
<i>I'll run if you should sigh.</i>

878
00:54:17,294 --> 00:54:20,979
<i>I must be so careful...</i>

879
00:54:21,670 --> 00:54:27,442
<i>...or I'll kiss my heart good bye.</i>

880
00:54:29,817 --> 00:54:37,394
<i>You shouldn't let me dream,
'cause I'm too romantic.</i>

881
00:54:39,578 --> 00:54:48,934
<i>Don't make me fall unless,
it could all come true.</i>

882
00:54:52,120 --> 00:55:00,280
<i>How can you say to me
that you're too romantic?</i>

883
00:55:00,281 --> 00:55:02,989
Well I mean it,
I'm really sincere about it.

884
00:55:02,990 --> 00:55:09,943
<i>Moonlight and stars have had
no effect on you.</i>

885
00:55:09,944 --> 00:55:14,140
Oh yes they have. I remember a little
girl once at the junior prom. We were...

886
00:55:14,141 --> 00:55:22,138
<i>What if I am too near
and you're too romantic.</i>

887
00:55:22,139 --> 00:55:25,324
Well that's dangerous. Don't you see?
You being near and me...

888
00:55:25,325 --> 00:55:32,023
<i>I'm half afraid
you wouldn't know what to do.</i>

889
00:55:32,024 --> 00:55:35,282
Well they tell me in that spot
your first impulse is the best one.

890
00:55:35,283 --> 00:55:39,201
<i>I'll tell you in a whisper...</i>

891
00:55:39,549 --> 00:55:44,493
<i>...the reason for my sigh.</i>

892
00:55:44,999 --> 00:55:48,498
<i>And if you believe me...</i>

893
00:55:48,840 --> 00:55:53,861
<i>You can kiss you're heart good bye.</i>

894
00:55:53,862 --> 00:55:55,730
Um hm, that's what I'm afraid of.

895
00:55:55,769 --> 00:56:03,450
<i>I wouldn't harm your dream
'cause you're too romantic.</i>

896
00:56:03,451 --> 00:56:04,736
Now you're catchin' on.

897
00:56:06,315 --> 00:56:08,406
<i>And if you fall...</i>

898
00:56:08,981 --> 00:56:15,937
<i>Well then it would all come true.</i>

899
00:56:20,147 --> 00:56:21,147
Josh!

900
00:56:28,813 --> 00:56:30,759
I don't agree at all Gloria.

901
00:56:31,040 --> 00:56:33,359
I've tried reasoning
with him and got nowhere.

902
00:56:33,360 --> 00:56:35,335
But there are different
degrees of reasoning.

903
00:56:35,336 --> 00:56:36,878
You're idea is to jump up and down

904
00:56:36,879 --> 00:56:38,991
and hit people on the head
with a baseball bat.

905
00:56:38,992 --> 00:56:41,194
Do you know of any
better way of handling Josh?

906
00:56:41,878 --> 00:56:44,012
Why do you suppose I came along?

907
00:56:46,013 --> 00:56:47,754
Oh I'm famished.

908
00:56:48,144 --> 00:56:52,175
I'm so hungry my spare tire's deflated.
Well pretty near.

909
00:56:53,126 --> 00:56:54,509
Not those poor bones again.

910
00:56:54,958 --> 00:56:57,683
I think perhaps they will
make soup once more.

911
00:56:58,039 --> 00:56:59,595
I think they've earned a rest.

912
00:57:01,746 --> 00:57:03,271
How 'bout some flapjacks, huh?

913
00:57:06,415 --> 00:57:07,495
Where's the flower?

914
00:57:08,520 --> 00:57:10,426
- Ace took it.
- Ace took it?

915
00:57:10,427 --> 00:57:11,508
- Um hm.
- Where is he?

916
00:57:11,509 --> 00:57:12,968
He's right out side.

917
00:57:16,807 --> 00:57:17,756
Ace what...

918
00:57:20,382 --> 00:57:21,947
What are you doing with our flower?!

919
00:57:21,948 --> 00:57:23,699
Boy are we gonna eat from now on.

920
00:57:24,157 --> 00:57:26,547
- What eat that muck?
- No this is for cockroaches.

921
00:57:27,665 --> 00:57:30,491
That's beautiful, we're staving to
death and you're feedin' cockroaches.

922
00:57:30,492 --> 00:57:32,626
No no. This is "Scramo".
The miracle exterminator.

923
00:57:32,627 --> 00:57:35,373
I'm going to put it up in little
jars and sell it for two bits a throw.

924
00:57:36,068 --> 00:57:38,713
- That stuff won't kill cockroaches.
- It will if they eat it.

925
00:57:39,415 --> 00:57:41,207
Suppose they get picky and refuse.

926
00:57:41,293 --> 00:57:43,173
Yeah well we'll just stuff
it down their throats.

927
00:57:43,174 --> 00:57:43,874
Uh uh.

928
00:57:47,543 --> 00:57:49,251
Hey sonny...
...come here.

929
00:57:49,949 --> 00:57:51,317
I never thought I'd stoop to this.

930
00:57:53,083 --> 00:57:54,205
What do you got there sonny?

931
00:57:54,400 --> 00:57:56,856
- You see what it is.
- Yeah that's food huh?

932
00:57:57,075 --> 00:57:58,998
- What are you going to do with it?
- Take it home.

933
00:58:00,234 --> 00:58:02,374
Say I bet a kid like you could have
a lot of fun with a knife like this.

934
00:58:02,375 --> 00:58:03,733
It's practically new.

935
00:58:08,860 --> 00:58:10,171
Ah...
It's no good.

936
00:58:10,551 --> 00:58:11,869
What do you mean no good?
It's one of the...

937
00:58:11,870 --> 00:58:12,570
Stop it!

938
00:58:14,008 --> 00:58:14,977
Hello rugged.

939
00:58:15,552 --> 00:58:17,148
Uh where did you get all this food?

940
00:58:17,313 --> 00:58:19,081
- At the feast.
- Feast? Where?

941
00:58:19,406 --> 00:58:21,522
Over there. They are giving food away.

942
00:58:22,144 --> 00:58:23,954
Ohhh, there giving food away.

943
00:58:24,815 --> 00:58:26,341
Well come on! Let's get Mima!

944
00:58:26,342 --> 00:58:28,186
The feast is only for natives.

945
00:58:28,677 --> 00:58:29,377
Natives?

946
00:58:36,860 --> 00:58:38,461
Go get that "Scramo"
and bring it in here.

947
00:58:38,462 --> 00:58:40,031
- The "Scramo"?
- Bring it right in here.

948
00:58:40,342 --> 00:58:42,654
What are you doing?!
Are you going crazy?!

949
00:58:42,655 --> 00:58:45,225
No, we're going native and
you're going along with us. Look out!

950
00:58:46,533 --> 00:58:47,233
What is this?

951
00:58:47,234 --> 00:58:48,909
This might not be any
good for cockroaches

952
00:58:48,910 --> 00:58:50,277
but it's going to be good for us.

953
00:59:36,301 --> 00:59:37,566
Uh... Uh...

954
00:59:39,388 --> 00:59:41,614
Um sooky dooky waky?

955
00:59:42,345 --> 00:59:43,756
Naw no sooky dooky.

956
00:59:43,902 --> 00:59:45,939
Oh sooky dooky bicarbonate of soda.

957
00:59:46,336 --> 00:59:47,523
Hokey dokey.

958
00:59:47,942 --> 00:59:50,084
Sooky dooky?
One for Monday.

959
00:59:51,123 --> 00:59:52,123
Sooky dooky.

960
01:00:00,969 --> 01:00:01,669
Hey...

961
01:00:02,748 --> 01:00:04,819
Nicky poo over there
is sure givin' you the business.

962
01:00:08,594 --> 01:00:10,409
I think she's the local dress maker.

963
01:00:37,313 --> 01:00:38,306
What'd he do with the match?

964
01:00:38,634 --> 01:00:40,667
He just gave his stomach the hot foot.

965
01:00:44,785 --> 01:00:46,578
So this is where he lives ay.

966
01:00:47,856 --> 01:00:48,997
Charming view.

967
01:00:48,998 --> 01:00:52,012
I imagine on a clear day one can
see the cannibals eating a missionary.

968
01:00:52,926 --> 01:00:56,105
So this is what he left home for.
Well where is he?

969
01:00:56,106 --> 01:00:57,257
That I wish I knew.

970
01:00:57,694 --> 01:00:58,664
Look!
Look!

971
01:00:58,932 --> 01:01:01,007
What have I got here?
It is his cap.

972
01:01:01,008 --> 01:01:02,954
- It is his cap.
- It is his cap!

973
01:01:03,260 --> 01:01:05,603
Why are you saying to me
what I'm saying to you?

974
01:01:06,635 --> 01:01:07,632
It is his cap.

975
01:01:11,099 --> 01:01:12,354
- Well?
- Mr. Mallon...

976
01:01:12,355 --> 01:01:14,017
...this boy he see them go away.

977
01:01:14,429 --> 01:01:16,181
Well go on, ask him where they went.

978
01:01:21,038 --> 01:01:22,004
What'd he say?

979
01:01:22,283 --> 01:01:23,715
There at the feast.

980
01:01:30,880 --> 01:01:33,111
Oh, I never should have
eaten that last duck.

981
01:01:33,444 --> 01:01:35,547
I do not feel so good my self.

982
01:01:36,289 --> 01:01:37,969
Would you like me to rub you're back?

983
01:01:37,970 --> 01:01:39,407
Oh that's not where they are.

984
01:01:42,298 --> 01:01:43,746
Care for some fruit?

985
01:01:43,747 --> 01:01:45,663
Oh check.
Check.

986
01:01:45,664 --> 01:01:46,419
File 'em.

987
01:01:49,695 --> 01:01:51,958
How often they give
these little taffy-pulls?

988
01:01:52,133 --> 01:01:53,432
Once a year.

989
01:01:53,433 --> 01:01:55,799
Ahh that's a long time between meals.

990
01:02:02,441 --> 01:02:05,124
- Here I go again.
- What came in?

991
01:02:06,095 --> 01:02:07,326
Where is Josh going?

992
01:02:07,965 --> 01:02:09,274
Oh where's he always goin'.

993
01:02:09,725 --> 01:02:12,677
He sees a pair of big brown
eyes and he starts doin' nip-ups.

994
01:02:13,450 --> 01:02:16,206
Give him a girl, a moon and
some stars and he goes haywire.

995
01:02:16,207 --> 01:02:17,526
In fact just give him a girl.

996
01:02:18,038 --> 01:02:19,996
I did not know Josh was like that.

997
01:02:19,997 --> 01:02:22,596
Oh sure he is, I know him.
I know how he works.

998
01:02:22,883 --> 01:02:25,195
And I'm the best friend he's got.

999
01:04:53,729 --> 01:04:55,912
Hey, they have jitterbugs down here too?

1000
01:05:01,753 --> 01:05:02,753
Hey, what's cookin' here?

1001
01:05:16,725 --> 01:05:17,725
That's free wheeling.

1002
01:05:22,100 --> 01:05:23,335
Well, pardon me.

1003
01:05:24,231 --> 01:05:25,743
- No.
- She want's to play.

1004
01:05:25,744 --> 01:05:27,333
- No!
- Well I have to be courteous.

1005
01:05:27,334 --> 01:05:28,966
It is a marriage ceremony.

1006
01:05:29,177 --> 01:05:31,095
Each girl chooses a
man to dance with her.

1007
01:05:31,162 --> 01:05:33,216
If they like each other it means
they are to be married.

1008
01:05:33,348 --> 01:05:34,807
This is the way they
pick their husbands.

1009
01:05:34,808 --> 01:05:35,808
The way they pick their husbands!?

1010
01:05:35,964 --> 01:05:37,850
How do you say scram in Kaigoon?

1011
01:05:44,849 --> 01:05:47,151
- Go away! He is mine.
- Spread out.

1012
01:05:51,054 --> 01:05:52,474
Whew, that was a close one.

1013
01:05:52,747 --> 01:05:54,964
In another minute she'd of had
a wedding ring through my nose.

1014
01:06:28,040 --> 01:06:30,030
Hey, how do you like that
he's chasing her into the woods.

1015
01:06:30,238 --> 01:06:31,810
That is part of the ceremony.

1016
01:06:32,067 --> 01:06:34,316
Yeah and if he catches her
he gets a set of dishes huh?

1017
01:07:45,208 --> 01:07:47,643
Boy what a swell spot
to open a hot-dog stand.

1018
01:07:48,793 --> 01:07:50,721
Hey, there marrying them off like flies.

1019
01:07:58,201 --> 01:07:58,901
Josh!

1020
01:07:59,269 --> 01:08:02,256
- She's got Josh!
- Josh!? Gosh!

1021
01:08:08,083 --> 01:08:09,083
No Ace wait...

1022
01:08:09,557 --> 01:08:11,285
- You can't go in there.
- Why not?

1023
01:08:11,286 --> 01:08:12,730
- You must dance.
- Well let's dance.

1024
01:08:19,510 --> 01:08:21,831
- How am I doin' bubbles?
- Break it up will you. Break it up.

1025
01:08:21,832 --> 01:08:24,384
Get away, I'm dancing my way
into food for the winter.

1026
01:08:24,385 --> 01:08:27,032
- No no! She has chosen you as husband!
- Huh!?

1027
01:08:27,033 --> 01:08:29,379
You're practically out of circulation.
That's the wedding march.

1028
01:08:29,380 --> 01:08:30,380
Well get me out of here.

1029
01:08:36,055 --> 01:08:37,055
Send for the marines!

1030
01:08:37,628 --> 01:08:39,628
- What are you doin'?
- I'm a decoy.

1031
01:08:42,888 --> 01:08:44,984
Hey make a break for it.
Here comes Ferdinand.

1032
01:08:46,297 --> 01:08:47,297
Get me outta here!

1033
01:08:49,486 --> 01:08:50,872
He's here somewhere.

1034
01:08:58,805 --> 01:08:59,506
There he is!

1035
01:09:02,431 --> 01:09:04,696
- What is that?
- That is your son Mr. Mallon.

1036
01:09:07,290 --> 01:09:09,076
Josh. Josh!
What the devil are you doing?

1037
01:09:09,776 --> 01:09:11,544
Dr. Livingston I presume.

1038
01:09:14,680 --> 01:09:15,765
Hello Skipper.

1039
01:09:16,942 --> 01:09:17,942
Hello Gloria.

1040
01:09:19,585 --> 01:09:20,585
Hello Josh.

1041
01:09:20,927 --> 01:09:22,258
Have you gone completely mad?

1042
01:09:22,259 --> 01:09:23,799
Uh, she's marrying me.

1043
01:09:23,800 --> 01:09:26,437
- It's about time.
- No, that's not Mima.

1044
01:09:26,438 --> 01:09:27,438
Mima's over there.

1045
01:09:28,814 --> 01:09:31,281
Go ahead take five.
I'll see you. Later.

1046
01:09:31,603 --> 01:09:33,574
This is the most disgraceful
thing you've ever done.

1047
01:09:33,899 --> 01:09:35,264
You're coming home with us!

1048
01:09:35,500 --> 01:09:36,842
And you're coming right now!

1049
01:09:36,843 --> 01:09:37,843
- But I can...
- Come on!

1050
01:09:37,844 --> 01:09:41,600
Never mind Josh. When we get home
we'll play Indian ever Friday night.

1051
01:09:41,601 --> 01:09:42,601
Oh I don't know.
I don't wanna...

1052
01:09:43,589 --> 01:09:44,589
And that girl...

1053
01:09:45,557 --> 01:09:46,747
...who is that girl?

1054
01:09:47,204 --> 01:09:50,019
Aw that's Gloria Wycott.
Josh is engaged to her.

1055
01:09:50,020 --> 01:09:51,881
She is very beautiful.

1056
01:09:58,584 --> 01:10:00,489
It's the craziest thing I ever heard of.

1057
01:10:00,758 --> 01:10:02,111
Josh, you...

1058
01:10:02,734 --> 01:10:05,949
I don't know where you get it from
but it's lunacy. Just plain lunacy.

1059
01:10:06,240 --> 01:10:09,750
You mean to say you'd rather stay here
and live in that... that... that pigsty?

1060
01:10:09,810 --> 01:10:12,412
Than to go home where you belong
and live like a civilized human being?

1061
01:10:13,040 --> 01:10:16,375
Now put down that baseball
bat and let me talk to him.

1062
01:10:18,494 --> 01:10:22,531
Josh... you remember me?
Don't you? The Wycott girl.

1063
01:10:22,670 --> 01:10:23,783
Oh why sure.

1064
01:10:23,784 --> 01:10:25,630
Well now here's the general idea.

1065
01:10:25,631 --> 01:10:28,799
We're going to take a nice
long leisurely cruse home.

1066
01:10:28,800 --> 01:10:30,929
Give you time to get over
eating with you're fingers.

1067
01:10:31,220 --> 01:10:32,815
And then every night in the moonlight

1068
01:10:32,816 --> 01:10:34,966
I'll whisper sweet nothings
into your ear.

1069
01:10:35,412 --> 01:10:36,898
Well you wouldn't want me now if

1070
01:10:36,899 --> 01:10:38,384
I didn't want to go back
with you would you?

1071
01:10:38,683 --> 01:10:41,049
After all, there's some things
around here I kinda like.

1072
01:10:41,050 --> 01:10:43,973
Yes, I saw one of them.
And I don't blame you.

1073
01:10:44,567 --> 01:10:45,794
But Josh...

1074
01:10:46,089 --> 01:10:48,389
...you've never see me in a sarong.

1075
01:10:48,867 --> 01:10:49,906
I'm quite a dish.

1076
01:10:50,616 --> 01:10:52,900
Well sure you are Gloria.
But it just happens that...

1077
01:10:52,901 --> 01:10:55,687
I told you. I told you.
You're just wasting your time.

1078
01:10:55,688 --> 01:10:57,631
Now I want no more nonsense out of you.

1079
01:10:57,907 --> 01:11:00,125
We're sailing tomorrow morning
and you're going with us.

1080
01:11:02,658 --> 01:11:07,500
But why would he want to live here?
Just like he's a... a nobody.

1081
01:11:09,152 --> 01:11:11,053
Why did he come with
you in the first place?

1082
01:11:11,170 --> 01:11:13,045
Oh I don't know.
That's Josh for you.

1083
01:11:13,569 --> 01:11:16,633
Do you think he will...
go back with her?

1084
01:11:16,750 --> 01:11:19,082
Yeah I guess so. He always
said they'd get him in the end.

1085
01:11:21,616 --> 01:11:23,483
Maybe it is better that way.

1086
01:11:24,988 --> 01:11:28,018
That girl... she is very pretty.

1087
01:11:28,629 --> 01:11:30,751
Aw Gloria is alright I guess. But...

1088
01:11:31,047 --> 01:11:32,836
...for my money I'll take
a little homemaker.

1089
01:11:34,439 --> 01:11:36,537
But Ace you always said that you...

1090
01:11:36,538 --> 01:11:38,559
Yeah, but a fella has
to learn hasn't he?

1091
01:11:39,073 --> 01:11:40,987
Take when I came here, with Josh.

1092
01:11:41,608 --> 01:11:44,141
Why we didn't even have a place
to put our cigarette butts.

1093
01:11:45,265 --> 01:11:47,525
Used to kick them through
a hole in the floor.

1094
01:11:48,419 --> 01:11:51,426
And I wanna' tell you Mima, when
I guy does that he's sunk pretty low.

1095
01:11:51,702 --> 01:11:52,402
Has he?

1096
01:11:52,968 --> 01:11:54,366
Yeah. And then you came.

1097
01:11:55,214 --> 01:11:56,565
And look at the joint now.

1098
01:11:57,161 --> 01:11:58,425
Why it's a home.

1099
01:11:59,460 --> 01:12:00,536
You like a home?

1100
01:12:00,537 --> 01:12:02,096
Oh sure I do.

1101
01:12:02,335 --> 01:12:04,797
Nothing but roamin' around.
Eatin' in hash joints.

1102
01:12:05,101 --> 01:12:07,661
Half the time with no toes in my socks.

1103
01:12:08,826 --> 01:12:10,870
I wanna tell you
I wouldn't ask a dog to do that.

1104
01:12:14,700 --> 01:12:15,967
Well I said it.

1105
01:12:17,803 --> 01:12:18,961
You said what?

1106
01:12:18,962 --> 01:12:21,407
Oh for peat-sakes Mima,
I'm askin' you to marry me.

1107
01:12:22,448 --> 01:12:24,521
Ace you are very sweet.

1108
01:12:25,068 --> 01:12:27,290
Am I?
Sure enough?

1109
01:12:30,961 --> 01:12:32,036
Hiya fellas.

1110
01:12:32,469 --> 01:12:33,549
Josh!

1111
01:12:33,845 --> 01:12:35,255
Hey, what are you doin' back here?

1112
01:12:35,504 --> 01:12:37,116
Oh I abdicated.

1113
01:12:37,272 --> 01:12:39,609
From now on I'm gonna
be nothin' but a nothin'.

1114
01:12:39,610 --> 01:12:40,841
Just like you two.

1115
01:12:41,408 --> 01:12:42,839
You are not going back?

1116
01:12:43,361 --> 01:12:46,162
No. They're sailin' tomorrow
but I'm gonna stickin' around.

1117
01:12:46,879 --> 01:12:48,183
I gotta protect my interests.

1118
01:12:48,951 --> 01:12:49,842
Hey wait a minute...

1119
01:12:50,372 --> 01:12:52,217
I got a little stock
in this corporation too.

1120
01:12:54,253 --> 01:12:55,579
Well what is this? You...

1121
01:12:56,116 --> 01:12:58,249
...don't seem to be very
happy that I'm stayin'.

1122
01:13:00,840 --> 01:13:02,988
Well you got a girl.
Why don't ya' go on home with her?

1123
01:13:03,594 --> 01:13:05,478
- Ya' can't have everybody.
- Why not?

1124
01:13:05,578 --> 01:13:07,689
'Cause I got some ideas my self.
That's why not.

1125
01:13:08,271 --> 01:13:10,661
Just when I start doin' alright
you come hoppin' back.

1126
01:13:13,303 --> 01:13:15,630
Why you dopey lookin' cluck.

1127
01:13:16,358 --> 01:13:18,255
You're kidding. You in love.

1128
01:13:18,429 --> 01:13:19,481
Well what's a matter with that?

1129
01:13:19,824 --> 01:13:21,716
Dopier lookin' clucks
than me have been in love.

1130
01:13:22,101 --> 01:13:22,846
Well name one.

1131
01:13:24,058 --> 01:13:26,417
Yeah well what's the difference
between me and you? I'm human ain't I?

1132
01:13:26,418 --> 01:13:28,134
Well there's been some complaints.

1133
01:13:28,135 --> 01:13:29,861
Yeah? Well I don't go around singin',

1134
01:13:29,862 --> 01:13:32,268
or spoutin' a lot of hooey but
that don't mean I don't love her.

1135
01:13:32,705 --> 01:13:34,434
I love her more than you do.
What do you think of that?

1136
01:13:37,522 --> 01:13:38,445
There I said it.

1137
01:13:39,084 --> 01:13:40,384
Yeah you said it alright.

1138
01:13:40,385 --> 01:13:42,498
You're just givin' her the same
line of chatter you give every gal

1139
01:13:42,499 --> 01:13:43,508
before you run out on 'em.

1140
01:13:44,220 --> 01:13:47,505
Well how do you like that?
I suppose you didn't run out on Gloria.

1141
01:13:47,506 --> 01:13:49,350
Now wait a minute.
Let me tell you something...

1142
01:13:49,351 --> 01:13:50,573
...I'm in love with her my self.

1143
01:13:50,792 --> 01:13:51,693
What do you know about that?

1144
01:13:51,694 --> 01:13:53,525
Yeah well I want to marry her.
What do you think about that?

1145
01:13:53,555 --> 01:13:54,255
So do I.

1146
01:13:54,256 --> 01:13:56,829
Why do you suppose I'm staying here,
sending them on home with out me.

1147
01:13:56,880 --> 01:13:59,366
Josh...
Ace, please.

1148
01:13:59,367 --> 01:14:01,126
Well let's settle this right now.

1149
01:14:01,422 --> 01:14:03,044
She picks one of us
and the other one is out.

1150
01:14:03,045 --> 01:14:04,617
Well you can't put her
in a spot like this.

1151
01:14:04,618 --> 01:14:05,848
Suppose she doesn't
what either one of us?

1152
01:14:06,187 --> 01:14:07,451
What's a matter you scared?

1153
01:14:10,195 --> 01:14:11,977
Well alright, you asked for it.

1154
01:14:15,506 --> 01:14:16,626
Well there you are Mima...

1155
01:14:17,696 --> 01:14:18,760
...which one?

1156
01:14:31,549 --> 01:14:33,155
I'm sorry Josh.

1157
01:14:34,875 --> 01:14:37,172
Say I'm doin' alright
for a dopey lookin' cluck.

1158
01:14:37,517 --> 01:14:39,683
I hope you know just
how good you are doin'.

1159
01:14:41,742 --> 01:14:42,627
Well Mima...

1160
01:14:43,496 --> 01:14:45,757
He'll cause you a lot of trouble
and never make a quarter.

1161
01:14:46,327 --> 01:14:47,968
But he'll hand ya' a million laughs.

1162
01:15:16,631 --> 01:15:17,618
Uh... Captain.

1163
01:15:19,786 --> 01:15:20,529
Uh... Captain!

1164
01:15:21,854 --> 01:15:23,446
I would like to know something.

1165
01:15:24,347 --> 01:15:27,978
I would like to know if to stay in this
country a man must have a passport?

1166
01:15:28,054 --> 01:15:30,758
- You have not got one?
- Oh yes I've got one.

1167
01:15:31,959 --> 01:15:33,873
But I know one fellow who has not.

1168
01:15:34,008 --> 01:15:36,687
- Who is he?
- He's and American sailor he lives...

1169
01:15:36,688 --> 01:15:37,388
Hello.

1170
01:15:39,707 --> 01:15:40,407
Hello!

1171
01:15:41,999 --> 01:15:42,907
Anybody home?!

1172
01:15:44,941 --> 01:15:45,941
Are you Lannigan?

1173
01:15:47,932 --> 01:15:49,976
You haven't got a daughter
that's getting married have you?

1174
01:15:49,977 --> 01:15:52,586
- No. Why?
- Then I'm Lannigan. What do you want?

1175
01:15:52,587 --> 01:15:54,424
Your passport.
Let me see it.

1176
01:15:54,617 --> 01:15:56,066
- My what?
- Your passport.

1177
01:15:57,326 --> 01:15:59,647
Oh yeah, yeah. I had it right here.

1178
01:16:01,145 --> 01:16:02,105
Yeah I g...

1179
01:16:03,020 --> 01:16:03,908
Oh a Mima...

1180
01:16:04,264 --> 01:16:06,440
Uh, did you send my other
suit out to the cleaners?

1181
01:16:06,878 --> 01:16:09,742
Oh yes. It had spots all over it and...

1182
01:16:09,743 --> 01:16:12,080
...I did not think of looking
through the pockets.

1183
01:16:12,081 --> 01:16:12,781
Yeah...

1184
01:16:13,188 --> 01:16:15,059
Uh she sent it out to the cleaners.
If you come back tomorrow...

1185
01:16:15,060 --> 01:16:16,425
Well well that is too bad.

1186
01:16:17,425 --> 01:16:18,425
Wait a minute.

1187
01:16:20,740 --> 01:16:22,676
Boy what I'd give for a patty-cake.

1188
01:16:22,677 --> 01:16:24,648
- Come on. Get going.
- What are you going to do with him?

1189
01:16:24,649 --> 01:16:25,758
We're going to deport him.

1190
01:17:00,212 --> 01:17:09,059
<i>You know you're much too near,
and I'm too romantic.</i>

1191
01:17:10,590 --> 01:17:16,754
<i>Wouldn't I look a sight
on a bended knee.</i>

1192
01:17:19,240 --> 01:17:23,099
<i>I'm startled when you whisper.</i>

1193
01:17:23,718 --> 01:17:27,714
<i>I'll run if you should sigh.</i>

1194
01:17:29,188 --> 01:17:33,809
<i>I must be so careful...</i>

1195
01:17:34,615 --> 01:17:40,232
<i>...or I'll kiss my heart good bye.</i>

1196
01:17:42,410 --> 01:17:49,866
<i>You shouldn't let me dream,
'cause I'm too romantic.</i>

1197
01:17:52,247 --> 01:17:54,383
<i>Don't make me fall...</i>

1198
01:17:54,951 --> 01:17:57,699
<i>...unless it could all...</i>

1199
01:17:58,156 --> 01:18:00,486
<i>...come true.</i>

1200
01:18:04,579 --> 01:18:06,724
- Oh.
- Are you about ready for some bridge?

1201
01:18:07,566 --> 01:18:08,836
Yeah I'm ready.

1202
01:18:09,044 --> 01:18:11,530
Oh darling,
you've kept us waiting for hours.

1203
01:18:11,531 --> 01:18:13,109
I'm sorry. Let's go down huh?

1204
01:18:15,695 --> 01:18:17,227
Look at that gorgeous moon.

1205
01:18:17,560 --> 01:18:18,957
Certainly is lovely isn't it?

1206
01:18:28,107 --> 01:18:29,659
Take your prisoner to the boat.

1207
01:18:31,140 --> 01:18:33,113
Hey wait a minute.
What kind of racket is this?

1208
01:18:33,173 --> 01:18:35,018
Wait a minute.
Listen you fellas...

1209
01:18:35,019 --> 01:18:37,273
You're gonna get in trouble for this.
I know some big people.

1210
01:18:37,274 --> 01:18:40,512
- Tell them hello from me.
- Tell them hello for you. I aughta'...

1211
01:18:49,224 --> 01:18:50,127
Ace!

1212
01:18:51,046 --> 01:18:52,650
Ace, where are you.

1213
01:18:55,306 --> 01:18:56,852
- Ace.
- What do you want?

1214
01:18:57,123 --> 01:18:59,364
- Where is that gentlemen?
- He is already gone.

1215
01:19:11,369 --> 01:19:12,994
Come on.
Come on.

1216
01:19:15,074 --> 01:19:16,220
What is the matter with you?

1217
01:19:20,390 --> 01:19:22,739
- No. No!
- Come on.

1218
01:19:25,022 --> 01:19:26,097
Shut up!

1219
01:19:26,294 --> 01:19:28,511
Come on, hurry along,
we're ready to sail. Come on men.

1220
01:19:29,896 --> 01:19:31,858
- Here is the paper.
- Ah that's fine.

1221
01:19:37,158 --> 01:19:38,212
What's the matter with him.

1222
01:19:38,497 --> 01:19:39,197
He's nuts.

1223
01:19:39,483 --> 01:19:42,359
Oh, as you say in you're language
"He's nuts".

1224
01:19:42,484 --> 01:19:44,205
Oh no he is...

1225
01:19:44,206 --> 01:19:45,927
Come on men. Get him
out of here. Come on.

1226
01:19:46,043 --> 01:19:46,980
Come on, get him out.

1227
01:19:50,590 --> 01:19:52,231
Ace!
Ace.

1228
01:19:52,232 --> 01:19:53,164
Wait a minute.

1229
01:19:53,741 --> 01:19:58,083
There! There you take his sweetheart.
She will tell you.

1230
01:19:58,184 --> 01:20:03,123
- They are taking him away.
- Oh Ace! Ace! Ace darling.

1231
01:20:03,199 --> 01:20:05,639
Oh officer you can not take him.
You can not.

1232
01:20:05,640 --> 01:20:08,320
- No
- I love him. He has not done anything.

1233
01:20:08,321 --> 01:20:11,108
Madam my heart she bleeds,
but what can I do?

1234
01:20:11,109 --> 01:20:13,324
- It's not true!
- Come woman, come.

1235
01:20:13,928 --> 01:20:16,047
Come on, get him aboard.
Get him aboard. Come on.

1236
01:20:16,400 --> 01:20:17,680
You're alright. You think fast.

1237
01:20:17,804 --> 01:20:19,813
- We must leave here fast.
- Yeah, we're hot.

1238
01:20:21,113 --> 01:20:21,865
Go ahead.

1239
01:20:22,918 --> 01:20:25,113
There is another boat sailing
tonight, the "Star of Asia".

1240
01:20:25,404 --> 01:20:27,730
The first mate's a friend of mine.
I used to borrow money from him.

1241
01:20:35,725 --> 01:20:37,456
And when we land
someplace I'll get a job.

1242
01:20:38,032 --> 01:20:38,983
Steady I mean.

1243
01:20:39,619 --> 01:20:41,800
Aw gee that's a laugh. Me workin'.

1244
01:20:42,697 --> 01:20:44,432
And one of these days
I'll get you all dolled up

1245
01:20:44,433 --> 01:20:48,903
and we'll walk in on Josh and
Gloria and will they keel over. Boy.

1246
01:20:50,586 --> 01:20:52,104
We'll get married right away huh?

1247
01:20:52,986 --> 01:20:54,910
Yes Ace.
Right away.

1248
01:20:55,033 --> 01:20:58,000
Gee, I sure spin around
in side every time I look at you.

1249
01:20:58,567 --> 01:20:59,961
Guess that must be love huh?

1250
01:21:02,011 --> 01:21:04,469
Everything looks so good, feels so good.

1251
01:21:04,651 --> 01:21:05,858
The air and everything.

1252
01:21:06,242 --> 01:21:07,270
That the way you feel?

1253
01:21:09,059 --> 01:21:10,759
Yes that is the way I feel.

1254
01:21:11,140 --> 01:21:12,856
We'll get along fine.

1255
01:21:13,444 --> 01:21:14,942
We'll be very happy.

1256
01:21:22,037 --> 01:21:23,454
Why did you do it Mima?

1257
01:21:24,359 --> 01:21:25,344
Do what?

1258
01:21:26,028 --> 01:21:27,974
Well what's the use
of kidding our self's.

1259
01:21:27,975 --> 01:21:29,843
It's just not there. I'd know if it was.

1260
01:21:30,293 --> 01:21:32,168
Do not talk that way Ace.

1261
01:21:32,169 --> 01:21:34,761
- We will get married and...
- Oh no we won't.

1262
01:21:35,407 --> 01:21:36,949
It's Josh you want isn't it?

1263
01:21:38,471 --> 01:21:39,364
No.

1264
01:21:39,827 --> 01:21:41,403
Josh is where he should be.

1265
01:21:42,175 --> 01:21:43,258
Oh so that's it.

1266
01:21:44,322 --> 01:21:45,549
You went noble huh?

1267
01:21:46,944 --> 01:21:47,741
No.

1268
01:21:48,880 --> 01:21:50,422
No it is just that...

1269
01:21:51,198 --> 01:21:52,655
...I saw that girl and...

1270
01:21:53,008 --> 01:21:54,155
...his father and...

1271
01:21:55,279 --> 01:21:57,168
...I knew that he was not for me.

1272
01:22:02,071 --> 01:22:03,252
Forgive me Ace.

1273
01:22:03,947 --> 01:22:05,270
Please forgive me.

1274
01:22:10,005 --> 01:22:10,705
Josh...

1275
01:22:11,399 --> 01:22:13,258
...Sir Malcome is a very important man.

1276
01:22:13,964 --> 01:22:16,005
They don't hold these
boats for everyone.

1277
01:22:16,006 --> 01:22:17,840
I want you to be
particularly nice to him.

1278
01:22:18,218 --> 01:22:20,115
Sir Malcome's in a position to swing me

1279
01:22:20,116 --> 01:22:21,558
couple million dollars
worth of business.

1280
01:22:21,870 --> 01:22:24,374
I've never heard of such a thing.
Never! In all my life.

1281
01:22:24,375 --> 01:22:25,704
Why Sir Malcome, what happened?

1282
01:22:25,994 --> 01:22:28,451
Some blithering idiot
back there on shore

1283
01:22:28,545 --> 01:22:31,095
pulled me out of the crowd
and nearly ripped the coat off.

1284
01:22:31,096 --> 01:22:33,418
- That's all?
- Chucked a lot of muck all over me.

1285
01:22:34,684 --> 01:22:35,874
Sir Malcome...

1286
01:22:36,245 --> 01:22:37,253
"Spotto"!

1287
01:22:37,254 --> 01:22:39,907
That's it "Spotto"!
Slobbered it all over me.

1288
01:22:40,008 --> 01:22:41,359
Where? W-w-w-where was this?

1289
01:22:41,360 --> 01:22:44,403
How the blazes do I know?
Down the block a few streets.

1290
01:22:47,032 --> 01:22:49,745
Here, where are you going?
Josh! Come back here.

1291
01:22:55,602 --> 01:22:58,818
That little scene my friend
is called spurned at the alter.

1292
01:22:59,038 --> 01:23:00,412
Or the sailors farewell.

1293
01:23:03,868 --> 01:23:06,268
Say, have you see a fella with
a sweet potato selling soap?

1294
01:23:06,269 --> 01:23:08,149
- No sir. You want to buy something?
- No I gotta...

1295
01:23:08,788 --> 01:23:09,661
Oh Ace!

1296
01:23:12,463 --> 01:23:13,163
Ace!

1297
01:23:14,455 --> 01:23:15,303
Oh Ace!

1298
01:23:16,546 --> 01:23:19,057
And now watch "Spotto"
the miracle worker!

1299
01:23:19,557 --> 01:23:22,213
I want you to step right up
and take a bottle of this home.

1300
01:23:22,314 --> 01:23:24,407
The usual dollar bottle
sells for fifty cents.

1301
01:23:24,841 --> 01:23:28,245
I'm not gonna ask a quarter.
I'm not gonna even ask a dine.

1302
01:23:28,420 --> 01:23:30,024
But if anybody's got
a hot nickel come on

1303
01:23:30,025 --> 01:23:31,628
step up and get this bottle of "Spotto".

1304
01:23:31,629 --> 01:23:32,706
One hot nickel.

1305
01:23:32,707 --> 01:23:34,323
That's all.
Come on, who want's a bottle?

1306
01:23:34,324 --> 01:23:35,602
I'll take a dozen bottles.

1307
01:23:35,832 --> 01:23:37,150
There's a man who'll take a...

1308
01:23:38,550 --> 01:23:39,512
Josh!

1309
01:23:40,373 --> 01:23:41,832
Josh, Josh.

1310
01:23:42,341 --> 01:23:43,916
How are you Josh?

1311
01:23:44,417 --> 01:23:46,642
I've been trying to send you a
wedding present all over the world.

1312
01:23:46,776 --> 01:23:48,476
Weddi...
Why we didn't get married.

1313
01:23:48,477 --> 01:23:49,245
You didn't get...

1314
01:23:49,246 --> 01:23:51,388
No. You're the dopey
looking cluck she wants.

1315
01:23:52,433 --> 01:23:54,524
- Me?
- Yeah you. Step in.

1316
01:23:54,525 --> 01:23:55,225
Ohh, Mima.

1317
01:23:56,089 --> 01:23:57,167
Oh Josh.

1318
01:23:57,168 --> 01:24:00,473
Say look folks, you know what brought
this happy couple back together again?

1319
01:24:00,474 --> 01:24:02,506
It's "Spotto", the magic love potion.

1320
01:24:02,531 --> 01:24:05,053
Only one dollar a bottle.
Come in, get happy.

1321
01:24:05,054 --> 01:24:07,575
Reunites lovers.
Cupid in a bottle.

1322
01:24:07,676 --> 01:24:08,817
And he ruined my suit.

1323
01:24:08,818 --> 01:24:09,818
- Yeah?
- Yes.

1324
01:24:09,819 --> 01:24:10,519
Come on.

1325
01:24:10,520 --> 01:24:12,773
I pay him for it and you see what it is.

1326
01:24:13,436 --> 01:24:14,752
Come on, you go with us.

1327
01:24:15,159 --> 01:24:16,676
Here we go again.
Josh, beef.

1328
01:24:16,677 --> 01:24:17,377
What's a matter here?

1329
01:24:17,378 --> 01:24:19,090
You ruined his suit
now you come with us.

1330
01:24:19,091 --> 01:24:21,390
- Yeah I know, I'm terrible sorry.
- Here here, time, time now.

1331
01:24:21,607 --> 01:24:22,350
Take it easy.

1332
01:24:22,730 --> 01:24:24,613
Josh, I'm going with them.

1333
01:24:24,614 --> 01:24:26,180
Oh, you're going with them?

1334
01:24:26,181 --> 01:24:27,621
Yes, I'm going with them.

1335
01:24:27,622 --> 01:24:29,844
- Will you be gone long?
- Oh I'll check back from time to time.

1336
01:24:29,845 --> 01:24:31,927
Oh capital. Good.
I'll take over while your gone.

1337
01:24:31,928 --> 01:24:33,611
- Yes do, do.
- But don't for get...

1338
01:24:34,267 --> 01:24:39,392
Patty-cake patty-cake bakers man.
Bake a cake as fast as you...
