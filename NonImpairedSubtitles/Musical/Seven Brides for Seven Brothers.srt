1
00:01:59,532 --> 00:02:00,885
That's about 10 pounds.

2
00:02:01,132 --> 00:02:04,488
-How much is beaver worth this year?
-Six dollars a pound.

3
00:02:04,972 --> 00:02:07,122
I'll trade you for a new plow...

4
00:02:07,372 --> 00:02:09,886
...two tubs of lard,
a barrel of molasses...

5
00:02:10,132 --> 00:02:12,282
...25 pounds of chewing tobacco.

6
00:02:12,532 --> 00:02:16,286
And you wouldn't have a wife under the
counter? I'm looking for a wife.

7
00:02:16,532 --> 00:02:19,046
-Any special brand?
-Well, yes.

8
00:02:19,252 --> 00:02:21,812
I like a widow woman
that ain't afraid to work.

9
00:02:22,052 --> 00:02:24,043
There's me and my six brothers.

10
00:02:24,252 --> 00:02:26,925
Place is like a pigsty,
and the food tastes worse.

11
00:02:27,172 --> 00:02:31,131
So I made up my mind. The next time
I come into town, I'll get a wife.

12
00:02:31,372 --> 00:02:33,283
That's a fine thing, I must say!

13
00:02:33,532 --> 00:02:36,524
Thinking you could trade for a wife
like a bag of meal.

14
00:02:36,772 --> 00:02:39,081
No, ma'am.
I wouldn't say that, ma'am.

15
00:02:39,292 --> 00:02:43,808
None of our gals is going to go off
to bear country with you...

16
00:02:44,052 --> 00:02:48,489
...to cook and wash and slave
for seven slumocky backwoodsmen!

17
00:02:48,732 --> 00:02:51,292
There's 10 men
for every woman out here.

18
00:02:51,492 --> 00:02:53,722
You want a wife,
go back east.

19
00:02:53,972 --> 00:02:56,691
There's no unmarried females
in this town?

20
00:02:58,172 --> 00:03:00,083
Good morning, Mrs. Bixby.

21
00:03:00,292 --> 00:03:03,045
-We're having a quilting bee.
-Have any odds and ends?

22
00:03:03,252 --> 00:03:04,401
I'll see.

23
00:03:04,652 --> 00:03:06,483
-How about these?
-Just a minute.

24
00:03:06,692 --> 00:03:10,082
-What's the matter? They married?
-They're spoken for.

25
00:03:10,332 --> 00:03:14,689
-Just spoken for. You had me scared.
-I tell you, they're promised.

26
00:03:15,172 --> 00:03:17,481
A lady can change her mind,
can't she?

27
00:03:19,052 --> 00:03:20,405
Pay him no mind, girls.

28
00:03:20,652 --> 00:03:22,688
Load his things.
Don't keep him waiting.

29
00:03:22,932 --> 00:03:25,287
I'm in no hurry.
I got all afternoon.

30
00:03:25,532 --> 00:03:29,684
You're wasting your time. You won't
find a girl in this town to marry you.

31
00:03:30,452 --> 00:03:33,125
Whenever I set my mind to something,
I get it.

32
00:03:33,372 --> 00:03:35,124
Plowing 20 acres in a day...

33
00:03:35,372 --> 00:03:37,932
...or dropping a tree
right where I want it.

34
00:03:38,132 --> 00:03:39,724
I'm here to get me a wife.

35
00:03:39,972 --> 00:03:42,486
I don't aim to go
back home empty-handed.

36
00:03:43,052 --> 00:03:46,681
You're all pretty and fresh and young.
And I'll keep you in mind.

37
00:03:46,932 --> 00:03:50,288
But I ain't deciding on nothing
until I look them all over.

38
00:03:58,490 --> 00:04:00,720
Bless your beautiful hide

39
00:04:00,970 --> 00:04:03,404
Wherever you may be

40
00:04:04,090 --> 00:04:06,729
We ain't met yet
But I'm willing to bet

41
00:04:06,970 --> 00:04:09,359
You're the gal for me

42
00:04:10,490 --> 00:04:11,400
Morning, ma'am!

43
00:04:11,650 --> 00:04:13,766
-Morning.
-Mama, Papa wants you!

44
00:04:13,970 --> 00:04:16,120
Bless your beautiful hide

45
00:04:16,370 --> 00:04:18,725
You're just as good as lost

46
00:04:18,970 --> 00:04:22,087
I don't know your name
But I'm a-stakin' my claim

47
00:04:22,330 --> 00:04:24,321
Lest your eyes is crossed

48
00:04:28,970 --> 00:04:31,484
Oh, I'd swap my gun
And I'd swap my mule

49
00:04:31,690 --> 00:04:35,285
Though whoever took it
Would be one big fool

50
00:04:35,890 --> 00:04:37,084
Thanks, Adam.

51
00:04:37,290 --> 00:04:40,839
Or pay your way through cooking school

52
00:04:41,050 --> 00:04:42,688
If'n you...

53
00:04:43,530 --> 00:04:45,486
... would say, "I do"

54
00:04:46,850 --> 00:04:48,522
-Morning, ma'am.
-Morning.

55
00:04:48,770 --> 00:04:51,489
-Nice day for marrying.
-That's a right good idea.

56
00:04:51,730 --> 00:04:52,719
Oh, Lem!

57
00:04:52,970 --> 00:04:55,279
I thought you'd never ask me!

58
00:04:55,490 --> 00:04:57,879
Bless your beautiful hide

59
00:04:58,090 --> 00:05:00,684
Prepare to bend your knee

60
00:05:00,930 --> 00:05:03,888
And take that vow
Because I'm a-tellin' you now

61
00:05:04,130 --> 00:05:06,200
You're the gal for me

62
00:05:08,250 --> 00:05:10,718
Pretty and trim
But kind of slim

63
00:05:10,970 --> 00:05:13,530
Heavenly eyes
But oh, that size

64
00:05:13,730 --> 00:05:17,359
She's gotta be right
To be the bride for me

65
00:05:19,330 --> 00:05:21,605
Bless your beautiful hide

66
00:05:21,850 --> 00:05:25,763
Wherever you may be

67
00:05:35,130 --> 00:05:38,725
Milly! A dozen men bellowing
for victuals, and you chopping wood!

68
00:05:38,930 --> 00:05:40,488
I'm coming!

69
00:05:47,330 --> 00:05:49,844
Pretty and trim
But not too slim

70
00:05:50,170 --> 00:05:52,889
Heavenly eyes
Andjust the right size

71
00:05:53,090 --> 00:05:54,569
Simple and sweet

72
00:05:55,730 --> 00:05:59,325
And sassy as can be

73
00:06:00,930 --> 00:06:03,398
Bless her beautiful hide

74
00:06:03,650 --> 00:06:04,844
Yes, she's...

75
00:06:05,050 --> 00:06:08,565
... the girl for me!

76
00:06:16,570 --> 00:06:18,083
Milly, let's eat.

77
00:06:18,290 --> 00:06:20,087
-Let's eat.
-I'm dying of hunger!

78
00:06:20,330 --> 00:06:22,924
You'll all eat, don't fret.
Just give me time.

79
00:06:23,170 --> 00:06:25,001
Nobody can cook like Milly.

80
00:06:25,370 --> 00:06:27,679
-When are you gonna marry me?
-Next week, Sam.

81
00:06:27,930 --> 00:06:31,081
-She's gonna marry me.
-What would your wife say, Tom?

82
00:06:31,970 --> 00:06:34,120
-Anything you'd like?
-Could be.

83
00:06:34,370 --> 00:06:37,487
But first, I think I'd better
sample that cooking.

84
00:06:44,170 --> 00:06:45,489
Oh, Harry!

85
00:06:46,090 --> 00:06:47,728
I am sorry.

86
00:06:48,130 --> 00:06:50,598
-That's all right, Milly.
-Awfully sorry.

87
00:06:55,370 --> 00:06:58,885
-That smells good enough to eat.
-It tastes good too, so they say.

88
00:06:59,090 --> 00:07:00,682
Got any ketchup handy?

89
00:07:00,890 --> 00:07:03,279
My stew can stand on its own feet.

90
00:07:07,530 --> 00:07:08,440
Good?

91
00:07:09,370 --> 00:07:10,280
Good.

92
00:07:27,690 --> 00:07:29,885
My name's Adam Pontipee.

93
00:07:30,290 --> 00:07:31,518
Odd name, I must say.

94
00:07:31,770 --> 00:07:33,681
I live up the mountain.
I got a farm.

95
00:07:33,930 --> 00:07:36,728
-Have you?
-Good farm and a house on it.

96
00:07:36,930 --> 00:07:39,125
There's timberland,
high-grazing meadows...

97
00:07:39,370 --> 00:07:42,282
...sheep, milk cows,
50 acres of wheat.

98
00:07:42,530 --> 00:07:46,079
Only thing it ain't got,
it ain't got a woman. How about it?

99
00:07:47,010 --> 00:07:47,840
How about what?

100
00:07:48,650 --> 00:07:50,288
I just told you.

101
00:07:50,490 --> 00:07:51,718
How about marrying me?

102
00:07:55,370 --> 00:07:57,884
I know it's kind of short notice.

103
00:07:58,570 --> 00:08:01,528
Back east, we would have met
on a Sunday leaving church.

104
00:08:01,770 --> 00:08:04,330
Six months later,
I would've asked you:

105
00:08:04,570 --> 00:08:06,083
"Could I walk you home?"

106
00:08:06,690 --> 00:08:10,524
Next few years, I would've set in
your parlor every Wednesday night.

107
00:08:11,370 --> 00:08:14,089
Finally I'd ask your father
could I marry you?

108
00:08:14,970 --> 00:08:16,323
But there's not time.

109
00:08:16,570 --> 00:08:18,686
I've gotta be home
to tend to my stock.

110
00:08:18,890 --> 00:08:22,678
It'll be another five months before
I get down again with my grain.

111
00:08:23,170 --> 00:08:26,879
You gonna keep me waiting
that five months just for your pride?

112
00:08:32,330 --> 00:08:33,763
I have to finish my chores.

113
00:08:35,770 --> 00:08:39,479
I knew it the minute I set eyes
on you. You were the gal for me.

114
00:08:39,770 --> 00:08:42,887
I'll go get cleaned up a bit
and root out the preacher.

115
00:08:54,130 --> 00:08:56,121
Bless her beautiful hide

116
00:08:56,330 --> 00:08:58,764
Wherever she may be

117
00:09:17,770 --> 00:09:20,728
-Where's the preacher's house?
-Next to the church.

118
00:09:20,970 --> 00:09:21,925
Thanks, pop.

119
00:09:22,130 --> 00:09:24,928
She's the gal for me!

120
00:09:27,130 --> 00:09:30,805
I'll say it plain and to your face.
I don't like this marriage.

121
00:09:31,050 --> 00:09:33,280
-Reverend--
-I don't know anything about you.

122
00:09:33,490 --> 00:09:35,208
And I feel responsible.

123
00:09:35,450 --> 00:09:38,010
Milly's like a daughter.
We're her only family.

124
00:09:38,250 --> 00:09:41,322
Ever since I came here,
you've been after me to marry.

125
00:09:41,570 --> 00:09:45,722
A girl had no right to stay single.
The country needed to be settled.

126
00:09:45,930 --> 00:09:48,319
We meant you to marry
one of our young men.

127
00:09:48,570 --> 00:09:50,686
You had your pick of them.

128
00:09:50,970 --> 00:09:51,766
I tried.

129
00:09:51,970 --> 00:09:54,279
Again and again I tried.

130
00:09:54,770 --> 00:09:56,488
I'd say yes to one of them...

131
00:09:56,730 --> 00:09:58,686
...then a sinking feeling
would hit me...

132
00:09:58,930 --> 00:10:00,488
...and I couldn't do it.

133
00:10:01,850 --> 00:10:03,681
When I said yes to him...

134
00:10:04,330 --> 00:10:07,481
...I waited for that feeling,
but it didn't come.

135
00:10:07,770 --> 00:10:09,886
I feel just fine.

136
00:10:10,170 --> 00:10:11,683
I feel so good I could cry.

137
00:10:11,930 --> 00:10:14,922
I think it's wonderful!
Love at first sight.

138
00:10:15,130 --> 00:10:17,325
Alice! What kind of talk is that?

139
00:10:17,570 --> 00:10:19,686
You're determined, Milly?

140
00:10:20,170 --> 00:10:21,125
Yes, reverend.

141
00:10:21,370 --> 00:10:23,088
Then step forward.

142
00:10:24,770 --> 00:10:26,681
Take her hand in yours.

143
00:10:27,730 --> 00:10:30,403
Repeat after me:
l, Adam Pontipee...

144
00:10:30,650 --> 00:10:31,685
I, Adam Pontipee....

145
00:10:31,890 --> 00:10:34,529
...take this woman to be
my lawfully wedded wife.

146
00:10:46,170 --> 00:10:47,523
Where's she going?

147
00:10:47,770 --> 00:10:49,886
Never did like them Pontipees.

148
00:10:50,130 --> 00:10:51,882
Now I know why.

149
00:10:57,090 --> 00:11:00,480
Ma! Ma! He done it.
He got a wife!

150
00:11:01,690 --> 00:11:04,523
It's Milly!
It's indecent, if you ask me.

151
00:11:04,770 --> 00:11:08,046
One lone woman with
seven scroungy backwoodsmen.

152
00:11:20,850 --> 00:11:25,128
Bless your beautiful hide
Wherever--

153
00:11:27,370 --> 00:11:30,282
I'm not much of a bride
with only this for an outfit.

154
00:11:30,490 --> 00:11:34,085
You'll find a trunk belonged
to my mother. There's things there.

155
00:11:34,290 --> 00:11:35,325
I'd like that.

156
00:11:35,570 --> 00:11:38,528
I'd like to wear something
that belonged to your mother.

157
00:11:39,130 --> 00:11:41,280
My mother left me these.

158
00:11:41,570 --> 00:11:44,926
They're packets of seeds for
a flower garden she meant to plant.

159
00:11:45,130 --> 00:11:47,280
And my father left me these.

160
00:11:47,490 --> 00:11:49,879
Plutarch's Lives and the Bible.

161
00:11:50,490 --> 00:11:52,208
He taught me to read by them.

162
00:11:52,410 --> 00:11:54,685
I hope that maybe
someday I can teach our--

163
00:11:57,170 --> 00:11:59,126
How far is it up to the farm?

164
00:11:59,370 --> 00:12:01,088
About 12 miles.

165
00:12:01,570 --> 00:12:02,719
Imagine!

166
00:12:03,290 --> 00:12:05,485
On my way to my own home.

167
00:12:06,170 --> 00:12:09,287
I feel so wonderful I could yell.

168
00:12:09,530 --> 00:12:10,679
Go ahead.

169
00:12:19,050 --> 00:12:21,723
Echo Pass. It ain't safe
to shout in the winter.

170
00:12:21,970 --> 00:12:23,323
Might start an avalanche.

171
00:12:23,570 --> 00:12:27,085
I cussed my horse too loud once,
and we got snowed in till spring.

172
00:12:28,570 --> 00:12:30,606
Most people think
that'd be lonely...

173
00:12:30,850 --> 00:12:33,683
...but I can stand some loneliness
after the inn.

174
00:12:35,850 --> 00:12:37,568
I'd better water the horses.

175
00:12:57,370 --> 00:12:58,883
My wedding bouquet.

176
00:12:59,210 --> 00:13:02,282
-Sorrel?
-It makes real nourishing soup.

177
00:13:04,170 --> 00:13:08,129
Back at the inn, when I'd hear
the men yelling for their dinner...

178
00:13:08,330 --> 00:13:12,039
...I'd think how wonderful it would be
to cook and care for one man.

179
00:13:12,250 --> 00:13:14,081
Just one man.

180
00:13:14,970 --> 00:13:16,528
Now that it's happened...

181
00:13:16,770 --> 00:13:18,886
...I can't hardly believe it's true.

182
00:13:19,370 --> 00:13:20,519
Ding-dong

183
00:13:20,730 --> 00:13:22,686
Ding-a-ling-dong

184
00:13:22,930 --> 00:13:27,526
Were the steeple bells
Ever quite as gay?

185
00:13:27,770 --> 00:13:31,126
Wonderful, wonderful day

186
00:13:33,890 --> 00:13:38,486
Bluebirds in the bluebells
Sing a song

187
00:13:38,730 --> 00:13:42,120
To send me along my way

188
00:13:42,370 --> 00:13:45,328
Wonderful, wonderful day

189
00:13:48,570 --> 00:13:51,880
Though I've got to own up

190
00:13:52,130 --> 00:13:56,009
I'm as grown up as can be

191
00:13:57,090 --> 00:14:00,321
Seems I've gone and flown up

192
00:14:00,570 --> 00:14:04,324
To a bright, merry...

193
00:14:04,570 --> 00:14:09,166
...airy fairyland

194
00:14:10,530 --> 00:14:14,079
And so you'll forgive me

195
00:14:14,290 --> 00:14:18,806
If I simply throw out my chest
And say

196
00:14:19,050 --> 00:14:22,167
Beautiful, glorious

197
00:14:23,130 --> 00:14:27,282
Heavenly, marvelous

198
00:14:28,770 --> 00:14:31,842
Wonderful, wonderful day

199
00:14:35,050 --> 00:14:38,281
Big clouds floatin' lazy

200
00:14:38,490 --> 00:14:41,482
Like a daisy in the sky

201
00:14:43,090 --> 00:14:46,366
Big things to be doing

202
00:14:46,770 --> 00:14:48,522
By and by

203
00:14:49,170 --> 00:14:50,444
Goin'

204
00:14:51,050 --> 00:14:52,802
Slowin'

205
00:14:53,570 --> 00:14:56,243
Growin' things

206
00:14:57,770 --> 00:15:01,479
Big love for my darlin'

207
00:15:01,730 --> 00:15:06,326
As we share whatever may come our way

208
00:15:06,570 --> 00:15:09,687
Beautiful, glorious

209
00:15:12,050 --> 00:15:13,802
Heavenly

210
00:15:15,530 --> 00:15:18,124
Marvelous

211
00:15:21,450 --> 00:15:23,281
Wonderful...

212
00:15:23,490 --> 00:15:26,687
... wonderful day

213
00:15:56,730 --> 00:15:59,085
This is my brother Caleb.

214
00:15:59,770 --> 00:16:02,409
-How are you, brother Caleb?
-My wife, Milly.

215
00:16:02,650 --> 00:16:03,924
Your wife?

216
00:16:04,250 --> 00:16:06,127
Well, I'll be a monkey's uncle.

217
00:16:06,330 --> 00:16:10,084
Hey, Eph, Dan, he done it!
He got married!

218
00:16:13,930 --> 00:16:16,490
This is my brothers
Ephraim and Daniel.

219
00:16:17,970 --> 00:16:20,484
Hi, brother Ephraim, brother Daniel.

220
00:16:21,690 --> 00:16:23,681
Which is Ephraim and
which is Daniel?

221
00:16:23,930 --> 00:16:24,840
Me.

222
00:16:25,050 --> 00:16:27,280
And this here's Benjamin.

223
00:16:28,570 --> 00:16:30,481
How are you, brother Benjamin?

224
00:16:30,770 --> 00:16:32,681
You didn't tell me you had brothers.

225
00:16:33,290 --> 00:16:35,884
Must have been the wedding,
threw it out of my mind.

226
00:16:38,530 --> 00:16:40,043
You all live around here?

227
00:16:40,250 --> 00:16:41,683
Not around.

228
00:16:42,050 --> 00:16:43,039
Here.

229
00:16:50,050 --> 00:16:52,484
I guess I should have
picked some more sorrel.

230
00:16:53,090 --> 00:16:54,682
This is the house.

231
00:17:09,530 --> 00:17:11,282
My, what a nice big room.

232
00:17:11,530 --> 00:17:13,521
It might need readying up a bit...

233
00:17:13,770 --> 00:17:15,283
...but now that you're here....

234
00:17:16,050 --> 00:17:19,884
Come on, wake up and meet
your sister-in-law. This is Frank.

235
00:17:20,570 --> 00:17:23,687
-How are you, brother Frank?
-And this here's Gideon.

236
00:17:24,170 --> 00:17:25,444
Drop that spoon.

237
00:17:25,650 --> 00:17:28,483
We'll have human-cooking
now that she's here.

238
00:17:28,730 --> 00:17:30,402
-Are there any more?
-No.

239
00:17:30,650 --> 00:17:32,481
Gideon's the last-born.

240
00:17:33,970 --> 00:17:36,723
Take a while to put the name
with the right brother.

241
00:17:36,970 --> 00:17:38,528
Just remember your ABCs.

242
00:17:38,770 --> 00:17:42,080
Adam, Benjamin, Caleb, Daniel,
Ephraim, Frank and Gideon.

243
00:17:43,250 --> 00:17:45,718
They're fine-sounding names.
Bible names.

244
00:17:45,970 --> 00:17:47,403
That was Ma's idea.

245
00:17:47,650 --> 00:17:50,483
ABCs, that was Pa's
so he could keep track of us.

246
00:17:50,690 --> 00:17:54,000
He was gonna use all
26 letters right down to Zachariah...

247
00:17:54,250 --> 00:17:57,686
...but he looked at Gideon and went
and chopped a tree on himself.

248
00:17:58,890 --> 00:18:02,326
There's one of the names in the Bible
I don't seem to remember.

249
00:18:02,570 --> 00:18:05,289
Frank. Is Frank a Bible name?

250
00:18:05,490 --> 00:18:07,287
That ain't his real name, is it?

251
00:18:07,490 --> 00:18:10,880
We just call him that for short.
His real name is Frank--

252
00:18:11,930 --> 00:18:13,727
Pay them no mind.
I'll show you around.

253
00:18:13,930 --> 00:18:16,490
-Up here's the bedroom.
-Can't you stop them?

254
00:18:16,690 --> 00:18:20,126
-You'll get used to that.
-Was it something I said?

255
00:18:20,330 --> 00:18:22,321
Frank's just touchy about his name.

256
00:18:22,570 --> 00:18:24,720
There was no "F" names
in the Bible...

257
00:18:24,970 --> 00:18:28,087
...so Ma named him Frankincense
because he smelled so sweet.

258
00:18:28,570 --> 00:18:30,128
Up there's the bedroom.

259
00:18:30,370 --> 00:18:34,079
Down there's where the boys bunk.
Follow me, I'll show you the rest.

260
00:18:38,850 --> 00:18:40,522
This is the washroom.

261
00:18:40,770 --> 00:18:44,649
We're hard on clothes, so there'll
be a lot of washing and mending.

262
00:18:44,850 --> 00:18:47,080
-But now that--
-That I'm here.

263
00:18:48,770 --> 00:18:50,283
This is the kitchen.

264
00:18:50,890 --> 00:18:54,087
You'll find flour
in that barrel right there.

265
00:18:54,290 --> 00:18:56,008
Salt pork over there.

266
00:18:56,250 --> 00:18:59,481
Get out of here!
How do you expect her to get supper?

267
00:18:59,690 --> 00:19:02,887
Come on, all of you, get out of here.
You too, Gideon.

268
00:19:05,530 --> 00:19:09,682
You'll find wood down the path,
and water's outside the front door.

269
00:19:10,530 --> 00:19:12,088
There's the dinner bell.

270
00:19:12,330 --> 00:19:14,480
Ring it loud
when you get supper ready.

271
00:19:57,250 --> 00:19:59,320
-What'd you do that for?
-You....

272
00:19:59,570 --> 00:20:01,686
All of you falling
on the food that way!

273
00:20:01,930 --> 00:20:04,490
Haven't you any decency
to wait for grace?

274
00:20:06,530 --> 00:20:08,282
You don't even know
what I'm saying!

275
00:20:08,530 --> 00:20:10,088
-Trouble?
-Look at them!

276
00:20:10,290 --> 00:20:11,882
The victuals must be good.

277
00:20:14,370 --> 00:20:15,689
All right.

278
00:20:16,450 --> 00:20:18,520
If you're gonna act like hogs...

279
00:20:18,770 --> 00:20:21,079
...you can eat like hogs!

280
00:20:34,730 --> 00:20:36,925
"Neither cast ye your pearls
before swine...

281
00:20:37,130 --> 00:20:39,200
...Iest they trample them
under their feet...

282
00:20:39,450 --> 00:20:41,680
...and turn again and rend you."

283
00:21:25,250 --> 00:21:27,684
It's time for you boys
to turn in, ain't it?

284
00:21:29,770 --> 00:21:31,886
A big day of plowing ahead tomorrow.

285
00:21:35,650 --> 00:21:38,687
It's 9:00 already,
an hour past your bedtime.

286
00:21:39,330 --> 00:21:40,558
Yours too.

287
00:21:48,050 --> 00:21:50,484
I am getting a mite sleepy at that.

288
00:22:07,930 --> 00:22:10,922
-Who is it?
-It's Adam, your husband.

289
00:22:11,130 --> 00:22:12,688
Come in, Adam.

290
00:22:17,570 --> 00:22:18,889
Good night, boys.

291
00:22:30,730 --> 00:22:32,368
I thought you'd be in bed.

292
00:22:32,570 --> 00:22:33,889
Did you?

293
00:22:35,330 --> 00:22:37,127
It's been a right busy day.

294
00:22:37,370 --> 00:22:39,281
You must be kind of tuckered out.

295
00:22:39,970 --> 00:22:41,119
That's right.

296
00:22:41,330 --> 00:22:42,683
Shall l...

297
00:22:43,130 --> 00:22:44,882
...turn down the covers?

298
00:22:45,330 --> 00:22:46,888
You can if you like.

299
00:22:48,290 --> 00:22:50,087
But I'm not going to bed.

300
00:22:52,050 --> 00:22:54,280
You don't want a wife, Adam.

301
00:22:54,570 --> 00:22:56,720
You want a cook, a washerwoman.

302
00:22:56,930 --> 00:22:58,488
A hired girl.

303
00:22:58,970 --> 00:23:01,689
A hired girl's got a right
to her own sleeping place.

304
00:23:01,890 --> 00:23:05,007
-Reckon that's so.
-In the wagon, you let me talk...

305
00:23:05,250 --> 00:23:08,287
...make a fool of myself,
talking about you and me.

306
00:23:08,730 --> 00:23:10,686
You should have stopped me.

307
00:23:11,970 --> 00:23:13,688
Maybe I should have...

308
00:23:14,530 --> 00:23:16,680
...but it sounded real pretty.

309
00:23:17,090 --> 00:23:18,364
Besides...

310
00:23:18,770 --> 00:23:21,523
...if I'd told you,
you might not have married me.

311
00:23:21,770 --> 00:23:24,489
And I wanted you to marry me.
I wanted it real bad.

312
00:23:24,730 --> 00:23:28,609
Sure, because I was young and strong,
and there was lots of work in me.

313
00:23:28,850 --> 00:23:29,965
That's partly true.

314
00:23:30,170 --> 00:23:32,843
It's a hard life here
in the forest and wilderness.

315
00:23:33,050 --> 00:23:35,723
There's trees waiting to be felled...

316
00:23:35,970 --> 00:23:39,007
...Iand waiting to be plowed
and fenced, stock to be fed.

317
00:23:39,250 --> 00:23:42,083
A man wants a wife
who can work alongside of him.

318
00:23:45,570 --> 00:23:47,288
Of course...

319
00:23:47,930 --> 00:23:52,287
...if she's got eyes
that are bluer than cornflowers...

320
00:23:52,690 --> 00:23:55,488
...and hair the color of wheat
in the sunshine...

321
00:23:56,170 --> 00:23:58,684
...he counts himself real fortunate.

322
00:24:02,130 --> 00:24:04,485
I'll work alongside you, Adam...

323
00:24:05,730 --> 00:24:08,085
...but I'm not sleeping alongside you.

324
00:24:21,130 --> 00:24:24,088
She wants a drink of water.
She's thirsty.

325
00:24:41,290 --> 00:24:42,689
Have a drink.

326
00:24:50,170 --> 00:24:51,319
What are you doing?

327
00:24:51,570 --> 00:24:53,288
Bedding down for the night.

328
00:24:54,090 --> 00:24:56,285
I don't know
what the birds see in it.

329
00:24:57,650 --> 00:24:59,083
It don't seem fitting...

330
00:24:59,330 --> 00:25:01,844
...for a groom to spend
his wedding night in a tree.

331
00:25:02,050 --> 00:25:03,881
It's your idea, not mine.

332
00:25:06,250 --> 00:25:08,480
I guess I was pretty mad, Adam.

333
00:25:10,050 --> 00:25:12,120
I built up such a store of dreams.

334
00:25:12,370 --> 00:25:14,281
Dreams about love...

335
00:25:14,570 --> 00:25:16,686
...and marriage and such.

336
00:25:17,370 --> 00:25:20,726
When you're in love

337
00:25:21,770 --> 00:25:24,648
When you're in love

338
00:25:26,370 --> 00:25:29,646
There is no way on earth...

339
00:25:29,850 --> 00:25:33,206
... to hide it

340
00:25:34,570 --> 00:25:37,721
When you're in love

341
00:25:39,130 --> 00:25:41,883
Really in love

342
00:25:43,170 --> 00:25:45,206
You simply let...

343
00:25:45,450 --> 00:25:49,159
... your heart decide it

344
00:25:51,570 --> 00:25:54,767
With every sigh

345
00:25:56,370 --> 00:25:59,362
With every glance

346
00:26:00,770 --> 00:26:03,125
With every heartbeat

347
00:26:03,370 --> 00:26:06,646
You confide it

348
00:26:09,450 --> 00:26:12,647
You'll want the world...

349
00:26:12,970 --> 00:26:15,564
... to know it too

350
00:26:20,170 --> 00:26:24,561
When you're in love

351
00:26:26,770 --> 00:26:31,002
As I'm in love

352
00:26:32,530 --> 00:26:34,805
With you

353
00:26:46,330 --> 00:26:48,480
I know how it is with your brothers.

354
00:26:49,130 --> 00:26:51,280
You being the head
of the house and all.

355
00:26:52,570 --> 00:26:54,879
I wouldn't want you to lose face.

356
00:26:57,650 --> 00:26:59,686
All things considered...

357
00:27:00,170 --> 00:27:02,684
...maybe you'd better come back in.

358
00:27:31,650 --> 00:27:32,685
Bacon.

359
00:27:33,450 --> 00:27:34,883
Fresh-made coffee!

360
00:27:35,450 --> 00:27:36,565
Hot bread!

361
00:27:36,770 --> 00:27:38,681
It's Milly cooking!

362
00:27:40,290 --> 00:27:43,088
-Adam must've told her what was what.
-It smells good.

363
00:27:43,290 --> 00:27:46,487
-I'm hungry!
-I feel like I haven't eaten for years.

364
00:27:48,770 --> 00:27:50,362
Where's my pants?

365
00:27:50,570 --> 00:27:53,687
-Where's my shirt and pants?
-I'm looking for my own!

366
00:27:54,930 --> 00:27:56,727
Who did it?
Who hid them on me?

367
00:27:56,970 --> 00:27:59,882
-All I've got's my boots.
-Good morning, my brothers.

368
00:28:00,570 --> 00:28:03,084
Your outside clothes
are drying on the line.

369
00:28:03,290 --> 00:28:04,689
I came in and got them.

370
00:28:05,850 --> 00:28:08,683
I couldn't get your underclothes,
so I'll take them now.

371
00:28:08,930 --> 00:28:09,999
Our underwear?

372
00:28:10,250 --> 00:28:12,684
Your winter underwear
that you're sleeping in.

373
00:28:14,570 --> 00:28:15,844
Hand them over.

374
00:28:16,050 --> 00:28:18,644
You won't get clothes or food
till you get clean.

375
00:28:19,250 --> 00:28:20,683
And shaved.

376
00:28:23,370 --> 00:28:25,725
Where's Adam?
We wanna talk to Adam!

377
00:28:25,970 --> 00:28:28,643
He's out plowing.
He had breakfast half an hour ago.

378
00:28:29,930 --> 00:28:31,124
I got hot muffins...

379
00:28:31,570 --> 00:28:34,130
...crisp bacon, hotcakes,
steak, fryer potatoes...

380
00:28:34,370 --> 00:28:36,088
...fresh-ground coffee.

381
00:28:38,050 --> 00:28:40,962
Do I get that underwear,
or do I come and take it?

382
00:28:42,770 --> 00:28:45,330
Don't listen to her.
She wouldn't dare.

383
00:28:45,530 --> 00:28:47,680
Oh, wouldn't l?

384
00:28:49,770 --> 00:28:51,920
All right, all right,
you'll get it.

385
00:29:11,170 --> 00:29:14,685
I didn't know last night I'd married
into such a handsome family.

386
00:29:14,930 --> 00:29:17,285
You know, you're mighty
good-looking boys.

387
00:29:17,930 --> 00:29:20,285
Well, you are.
Every last one of you!

388
00:29:21,490 --> 00:29:24,721
What you been doing
hiding behind those whiskers?

389
00:29:24,970 --> 00:29:27,484
Afraid a girl will see you
and run off with you?

390
00:29:31,810 --> 00:29:36,088
Why haven't I seen you at the dances
or cornhuskings at harvest-time?

391
00:29:37,170 --> 00:29:38,398
Don't you like girls?

392
00:29:38,650 --> 00:29:41,289
We ain't never hardly ever seen one.

393
00:29:41,650 --> 00:29:44,483
You got a big sister now
that's gonna see that you do.

394
00:29:49,730 --> 00:29:51,083
You want to eat?

395
00:30:01,330 --> 00:30:04,208
Lord, Thou has brought us
through desert and wilderness...

396
00:30:04,450 --> 00:30:08,728
...to a good land, a land of wheat
and game, where we need never hunger.

397
00:30:08,930 --> 00:30:12,047
We thank Thee, Lord,
for Thy loving care and Thy bounty.

398
00:30:12,250 --> 00:30:13,285
Amen.

399
00:30:14,570 --> 00:30:15,889
Amen.

400
00:30:19,570 --> 00:30:20,889
After you.

401
00:30:25,170 --> 00:30:26,489
Thank you.

402
00:30:32,130 --> 00:30:34,928
-Where you going?
-I've got to go to town, Gideon.

403
00:30:35,170 --> 00:30:38,082
The flour's low,
and I've worn a broom clear through.

404
00:30:38,330 --> 00:30:39,729
I'd better help you.

405
00:30:39,930 --> 00:30:42,080
-What's going on?
-We're going to town.

406
00:30:42,330 --> 00:30:45,879
-I reckon I'll help drive the horses.
-I'll drive.

407
00:30:47,570 --> 00:30:49,481
Hey, Milly's going to town!

408
00:30:49,730 --> 00:30:51,288
Let's go with them!

409
00:31:03,530 --> 00:31:05,919
You boys set here and wait.
Gideon will help me.

410
00:31:06,170 --> 00:31:08,479
And don't forget, mind your manners.

411
00:31:09,690 --> 00:31:11,408
Hey, look. Girls!

412
00:31:15,930 --> 00:31:17,682
Quick! Say something.

413
00:31:19,050 --> 00:31:21,120
Care for a chaw of tobacco?

414
00:31:21,330 --> 00:31:22,126
What's going on?

415
00:31:22,330 --> 00:31:23,809
That oaf insulted us.

416
00:31:24,010 --> 00:31:27,286
No such thing. All he did
was offer them a chaw of--

417
00:31:27,530 --> 00:31:30,488
-Well, it's dang good tobacco.
-It is, huh?

418
00:31:40,610 --> 00:31:41,406
It's us!

419
00:31:46,090 --> 00:31:46,886
My window!

420
00:31:47,970 --> 00:31:50,882
Stop it, Benjamin.
Stop it this minute!

421
00:31:51,650 --> 00:31:53,129
Do something!

422
00:31:53,370 --> 00:31:55,326
What for? There's only three.

423
00:31:57,250 --> 00:31:59,366
-Stop it! Do you hear?
-All right, Milly.

424
00:32:06,890 --> 00:32:08,164
It's stopped.

425
00:32:08,930 --> 00:32:11,364
You get in that wagon! Get!

426
00:32:17,570 --> 00:32:19,401
What did I do wrong, Milly?

427
00:32:19,650 --> 00:32:24,360
First off, if you want to get a girl,
you gotta learn to talk to her.

428
00:32:24,730 --> 00:32:26,004
I'll show you.

429
00:32:26,250 --> 00:32:29,686
I'm a girl.
You meet me coming out of church.

430
00:32:29,930 --> 00:32:31,568
You raise your hat.

431
00:32:33,210 --> 00:32:36,839
-What's the matter, Caleb?
-My hair ain't combed.

432
00:32:37,090 --> 00:32:38,887
Next, you got to say something nice.

433
00:32:39,130 --> 00:32:40,961
Gideon, say something nice.

434
00:32:41,930 --> 00:32:44,160
Nice night for a coon hunt.

435
00:32:44,890 --> 00:32:46,801
You get out of here.

436
00:32:47,050 --> 00:32:50,679
You'll never make jack-a-dandies
out of them.

437
00:32:50,930 --> 00:32:53,603
You pay him no mind.
You'll be just fine.

438
00:32:53,850 --> 00:32:56,967
It's a month before the
barn-raising and the picnic.

439
00:32:57,210 --> 00:32:59,485
There's one thing
you got to remember.

440
00:32:59,730 --> 00:33:01,607
You'll have a lot of competition.

441
00:33:01,850 --> 00:33:05,047
All the girls will have 5 or 10
men buzzing around her.

442
00:33:05,290 --> 00:33:07,679
-We'll clean them out first.
-The whole lot.

443
00:33:07,930 --> 00:33:10,160
That's one thing you mustn't do!

444
00:33:10,370 --> 00:33:13,168
If they want to act like
a pack of hyenas, let them.

445
00:33:13,370 --> 00:33:15,361
You've got to be above such things.

446
00:33:15,610 --> 00:33:18,443
You've got to act gentlemanly
and well-spoken...

447
00:33:18,690 --> 00:33:20,965
...and show the girls
you have etiquette.

448
00:33:21,250 --> 00:33:22,763
Eti-- What?

449
00:33:23,090 --> 00:33:24,682
Like I showed you at the table.

450
00:33:24,930 --> 00:33:28,161
When you meet a girl, don't grab her
like she was a flapjack.

451
00:33:28,370 --> 00:33:30,042
Hold off for a while.

452
00:33:30,290 --> 00:33:31,962
Offer her your arm.

453
00:33:32,170 --> 00:33:35,685
When you've got her alone,
steal your arm around her.

454
00:33:35,930 --> 00:33:37,966
You've got to court a girl
to get her.

455
00:33:38,170 --> 00:33:40,240
You got to call her "my darling...

456
00:33:40,490 --> 00:33:44,369
...my dear, my precious, my pet. "

457
00:33:44,570 --> 00:33:47,038
Goin' courtin', goin' courtin'

458
00:33:47,290 --> 00:33:49,679
Oh, it sets your senses in a whirl

459
00:33:49,930 --> 00:33:52,285
Goin' courtin', goin' courtin'

460
00:33:52,530 --> 00:33:54,964
Dudin' up to go and see a girl

461
00:33:55,210 --> 00:33:57,565
Oh, it's fun to hunt and shoot a gun

462
00:33:57,810 --> 00:34:00,199
Or to catch a rabbit on the run

463
00:34:00,450 --> 00:34:03,010
But you'll find it's
Twice as sportin'

464
00:34:03,250 --> 00:34:04,763
Goin' courtin'

465
00:34:08,330 --> 00:34:11,163
-Is this what you mean?
-It's what I mean.

466
00:34:11,650 --> 00:34:15,086
Now there's lots of things
you gotta know

467
00:34:15,330 --> 00:34:19,039
Be sure the parlor light is low

468
00:34:19,690 --> 00:34:23,478
You sidle up and squeeze her hand

469
00:34:24,410 --> 00:34:27,607
Let me tell you, fellows,
That it's grand

470
00:34:27,850 --> 00:34:31,001
You hem and haw a little while

471
00:34:32,130 --> 00:34:35,645
She gives you kind of half a smile

472
00:34:36,450 --> 00:34:39,726
You cuddle up, she moves away

473
00:34:40,850 --> 00:34:43,728
Then the strategy comes into play

474
00:34:48,290 --> 00:34:49,439
See what I mean?

475
00:34:49,690 --> 00:34:52,363
Goin' courtin', goin' courtin'

476
00:34:52,610 --> 00:34:54,965
If you find it hard to break the ice

477
00:34:55,210 --> 00:34:57,599
Goin' courtin', goin' courtin'

478
00:34:57,850 --> 00:35:00,205
Here's a little feminine advice

479
00:35:00,450 --> 00:35:03,203
Roll your eyes
And heave a little sigh

480
00:35:05,370 --> 00:35:08,248
Grunt and groan
Like you're about to die

481
00:35:10,090 --> 00:35:12,809
That is what's known as emotin'

482
00:35:13,050 --> 00:35:14,563
Goin' courtin'

483
00:35:15,730 --> 00:35:18,164
-How about sparkin'?
-Parlor's darkened?

484
00:35:18,410 --> 00:35:20,560
And you're longin'
for a fond embrace?

485
00:35:20,770 --> 00:35:23,409
-What about pettin'?
-And sofa settin'?

486
00:35:23,650 --> 00:35:25,641
Suppose she ups and slaps your face?

487
00:35:25,890 --> 00:35:28,245
Just remember, blessed are the meek

488
00:35:28,490 --> 00:35:30,765
Don't forget to turn the other cheek

489
00:35:30,970 --> 00:35:33,279
Pretty soon you'll both be larkin'

490
00:35:33,530 --> 00:35:35,760
Goin' sparkin'

491
00:35:35,970 --> 00:35:38,359
-Goin' dancin'
-Goin' dancin'?

492
00:35:38,570 --> 00:35:40,640
At a fancy ball or minuet

493
00:35:40,890 --> 00:35:41,925
May l?

494
00:35:42,290 --> 00:35:45,566
Goin' dancin'
You'll impress them with your etiquette

495
00:35:45,770 --> 00:35:48,125
Now you two try it. Come on!

496
00:35:50,970 --> 00:35:53,245
You mean, men are learning
how to dance?

497
00:35:53,490 --> 00:35:55,765
Yes, it came direct
from Paris, France

498
00:35:56,010 --> 00:35:58,399
It will help with your romancin'

499
00:35:58,650 --> 00:36:00,368
Goin' dancin'

500
00:36:00,690 --> 00:36:02,567
Come on, now. You follow us.

501
00:36:03,770 --> 00:36:04,964
Turn.

502
00:36:05,210 --> 00:36:06,563
Down, up.

503
00:36:08,810 --> 00:36:09,765
Turn.

504
00:36:09,970 --> 00:36:10,766
Down, up.

505
00:36:10,970 --> 00:36:12,642
Come on, this way.

506
00:36:15,650 --> 00:36:16,605
Step to the right.

507
00:36:16,850 --> 00:36:18,966
Then to the left.
Make a turn.

508
00:36:20,090 --> 00:36:21,808
Now weave in and out.

509
00:36:23,570 --> 00:36:25,288
I love dancing!

510
00:36:30,290 --> 00:36:31,848
Now, boys!

511
00:36:54,410 --> 00:36:56,207
-Keep your dancin'!
-And huntin'!

512
00:36:56,450 --> 00:36:57,963
-And shootin'!
-And fightin'!

513
00:36:58,210 --> 00:37:00,280
And trappin'!
'Cause we're goin'...

514
00:37:00,530 --> 00:37:01,963
...courtin'!

515
00:37:12,970 --> 00:37:15,359
Cleanest fingernails I ever saw.

516
00:37:15,810 --> 00:37:16,879
What happened to your thumb?

517
00:37:17,130 --> 00:37:21,487
Soaked it in lye. Took off the dirt,
but it nearly took my nail with it.

518
00:37:21,730 --> 00:37:24,290
I'm so proud of you. All of you.

519
00:37:24,850 --> 00:37:28,286
Remember one thing.
Mind your manners and be gentlefolk.

520
00:37:28,530 --> 00:37:30,805
And no fighting,
no matter what happens.

521
00:37:31,050 --> 00:37:34,838
What's holding you up? lf we're
going to a barn-raising, let's go.

522
00:37:35,090 --> 00:37:36,489
Come on!

523
00:37:43,050 --> 00:37:45,200
Who are they?
I don't recall seeing them.

524
00:37:45,450 --> 00:37:47,645
-They're strangers to me.
-Seven of them!

525
00:37:47,890 --> 00:37:50,006
And all as tall as church steeples!

526
00:37:50,250 --> 00:37:51,569
It's Milly!

527
00:37:51,770 --> 00:37:53,965
-Where are you going?
-To see Milly!

528
00:37:58,050 --> 00:37:59,961
Looks like them Pontipee brothers.

529
00:38:00,210 --> 00:38:01,086
Milly!

530
00:38:01,450 --> 00:38:04,123
-Alice!
-Mil, I've missed you so.

531
00:38:08,290 --> 00:38:10,008
I've missed you all so much.

532
00:38:10,250 --> 00:38:12,559
I baked some things
for the collation.

533
00:38:12,810 --> 00:38:13,959
We'll take them over.

534
00:38:14,210 --> 00:38:16,360
I'd be pleasured if you'd allow me.

535
00:38:16,570 --> 00:38:18,128
Why, thanks.

536
00:38:23,170 --> 00:38:27,163
-We'll all help carry them.
-I couldn't let a lady heft that.

537
00:38:30,450 --> 00:38:31,963
-Can we help?
-Please.

538
00:38:32,210 --> 00:38:33,768
Allow me, ma'am.

539
00:38:39,890 --> 00:38:41,687
If you'll just follow me.

540
00:38:41,930 --> 00:38:43,966
To the ends of the earth.

541
00:38:49,210 --> 00:38:50,962
Afraid that's all.

542
00:38:51,970 --> 00:38:54,359
Sorry, that's all.

543
00:38:55,770 --> 00:38:57,806
May I escort you back?

544
00:38:58,050 --> 00:39:01,167
You know, you're the prettiest girl
I ever acquainted.

545
00:39:06,010 --> 00:39:07,841
May I escort you to the ball, ma'am?

546
00:39:08,090 --> 00:39:10,558
It wouldn't hurt you to learn some
manners too.

547
00:39:10,810 --> 00:39:14,359
What do I need manners for?
I already got me a wife.

548
00:39:17,410 --> 00:39:18,559
Come on,
get your partners!

549
00:39:18,770 --> 00:39:20,761
There's gonna be dancing.

550
00:42:33,970 --> 00:42:36,245
-Faster!
-Faster, Frank!

551
00:42:45,850 --> 00:42:47,568
Thattaboy, Carl!

552
00:43:52,210 --> 00:43:53,529
Take him, Dan.

553
00:44:06,330 --> 00:44:07,399
All right, Frank!

554
00:45:33,090 --> 00:45:36,207
Neighbors! Neighbors,
may I have your attention?

555
00:45:36,450 --> 00:45:38,645
You folk who have
come from far and wide...

556
00:45:38,890 --> 00:45:41,802
...Henry wants to thank you
for coming to raise his barn.

557
00:45:42,050 --> 00:45:43,483
Thanks, folks.

558
00:45:43,730 --> 00:45:46,563
And he thanks the ladies
for the victuals they brought.

559
00:45:48,610 --> 00:45:51,363
Since a barn's got four sides,
there'll be four teams.

560
00:45:51,570 --> 00:45:54,368
The team that gets their side up first
wins the heifer.

561
00:45:54,610 --> 00:45:56,009
Henry, show them Annabel.

562
00:45:59,490 --> 00:46:03,165
Get your teams set up,
and let's see who wins the little lady.

563
00:46:04,210 --> 00:46:06,485
We could use her on the farm.

564
00:46:06,730 --> 00:46:08,482
How about it, boys?

565
00:46:09,170 --> 00:46:12,958
Mr. Perkins, put the seven of us
brothers down for one team.

566
00:46:13,210 --> 00:46:14,928
Milly's taken a fancy to Annabel.

567
00:46:15,490 --> 00:46:17,765
You hear, boys?
That was Adam Pontipee.

568
00:46:17,970 --> 00:46:20,848
He bragged how he always
got what he set out to get...

569
00:46:21,090 --> 00:46:23,888
...and danged if he didn't.
He's a hard one to beat.

570
00:46:24,130 --> 00:46:25,643
-Don't worry.
-We'll handle them.

571
00:46:25,890 --> 00:46:26,800
That's the spirit!

572
00:46:27,050 --> 00:46:28,688
We got a team set up here, Pete.

573
00:46:28,930 --> 00:46:30,807
-Here's your fourth.
-That's fine.

574
00:46:31,050 --> 00:46:32,563
Got your hammers and all?

575
00:46:32,810 --> 00:46:36,962
Take your positions. The sooner you
raise it, the sooner you get vittles.

576
00:46:43,210 --> 00:46:44,802
Are you ready?

577
00:46:45,610 --> 00:46:46,759
Let's go!

578
00:47:18,290 --> 00:47:20,246
I shouldn't have had my hand there.

579
00:47:20,490 --> 00:47:22,765
-What happened?
-Nothing.

580
00:47:26,730 --> 00:47:28,960
Get that board up there.

581
00:47:30,330 --> 00:47:32,002
Now what happened?

582
00:47:32,690 --> 00:47:34,203
I stubbed my big toe.

583
00:47:34,450 --> 00:47:35,565
Come on, let's get going.

584
00:47:35,810 --> 00:47:38,165
Get those sideboards up here.

585
00:47:40,490 --> 00:47:42,321
Hurt yourself, Frankincense?

586
00:47:47,690 --> 00:47:49,248
Come on, let's go!

587
00:47:49,490 --> 00:47:52,960
-What's the matter with you boys?
-Just a little dizzy spell.

588
00:47:58,530 --> 00:47:59,883
Hold it! Take it easy.

589
00:48:00,090 --> 00:48:01,682
He threw that hammer!

590
00:48:01,930 --> 00:48:03,602
We promised Milly no fights.

591
00:48:03,850 --> 00:48:07,001
So don't start anything.
Come on, we're way behind.

592
00:48:07,250 --> 00:48:09,480
She's made you into
a bunch of mama's boys.

593
00:48:09,730 --> 00:48:12,369
They're out to kill you,
and you apologize for living!

594
00:48:12,570 --> 00:48:14,606
You're a disgrace to the Pontipee name!

595
00:48:15,170 --> 00:48:18,480
You're a bunch of lily-livered,
chicken-hearted lickspittles.

596
00:48:20,650 --> 00:48:23,801
Serves you right!
I hope they break your necks!

597
00:48:33,810 --> 00:48:35,448
Come on, Gideon--

598
00:48:38,050 --> 00:48:40,564
Why are you doing that?
He ain't done nothing!

599
00:49:40,930 --> 00:49:43,125
Boys, boys! Stop the fight!

600
00:50:54,090 --> 00:50:55,443
Witch hazel.

601
00:50:56,850 --> 00:50:58,283
Split lip.

602
00:51:01,130 --> 00:51:03,360
Don't smile for a few days.
Next?

603
00:51:05,810 --> 00:51:07,960
Two beefsteaks.

604
00:51:08,610 --> 00:51:10,168
A kick in the pants.

605
00:51:10,370 --> 00:51:11,564
Next?

606
00:51:11,770 --> 00:51:13,965
A loose tooth
and swelled-up knuckles.

607
00:51:14,210 --> 00:51:17,486
It's a wonder you have any teeth left.
Witch hazel, please.

608
00:51:17,730 --> 00:51:21,040
I'm sorry, Milly.
But when that fellow took after Adam--

609
00:51:21,290 --> 00:51:22,803
I understand.

610
00:51:23,050 --> 00:51:25,006
You all did your best, I guess.

611
00:51:26,370 --> 00:51:27,962
Good night, boys.

612
00:51:31,010 --> 00:51:32,568
Good night, Milly.

613
00:51:38,530 --> 00:51:41,761
I feel awful strange-like, Milly.
Here.

614
00:51:43,250 --> 00:51:46,845
If it's what I think ails you,
witch hazel's not gonna help.

615
00:51:51,890 --> 00:51:54,165
Alice is sweet, isn't she?

616
00:51:55,890 --> 00:51:57,164
Good night.

617
00:52:10,250 --> 00:52:11,603
What's the matter with you?

618
00:52:11,850 --> 00:52:13,966
Somebody butt you in the breadbasket?

619
00:52:15,970 --> 00:52:18,086
I felt this way even before the fight.

620
00:52:18,330 --> 00:52:20,560
Ever since I seen Alice.

621
00:52:26,530 --> 00:52:28,885
Do you reckon I could be in love?

622
00:52:30,930 --> 00:52:34,081
Pa used to say love's like measles.
You only get it once.

623
00:52:34,330 --> 00:52:36,764
The older you are, the tougher it goes.

624
00:52:37,010 --> 00:52:39,843
Young fellow like you
ought to get it kind of light.

625
00:52:48,730 --> 00:52:50,209
I guess not.

626
00:52:54,210 --> 00:52:56,963
I don't know as I can answer
your question.

627
00:52:58,130 --> 00:53:02,009
But according to Milly, and she's
had a heap of book-learning....

628
00:53:02,250 --> 00:53:05,287
When you're in love

629
00:53:05,850 --> 00:53:08,648
When you're in love

630
00:53:10,130 --> 00:53:12,803
There is no way on earth...

631
00:53:13,050 --> 00:53:15,405
... to hide it

632
00:53:17,010 --> 00:53:19,888
When you're in love

633
00:53:20,690 --> 00:53:23,124
Really in love

634
00:53:25,010 --> 00:53:27,763
You simply let your heart...

635
00:53:28,010 --> 00:53:30,365
...decide it

636
00:53:32,330 --> 00:53:34,924
How can you tell?

637
00:53:36,170 --> 00:53:39,082
What's in its spell?

638
00:53:40,450 --> 00:53:42,008
How can you tell...

639
00:53:42,250 --> 00:53:45,242
...until you've tried it?

640
00:53:47,770 --> 00:53:50,443
Wait for that kiss...

641
00:53:50,690 --> 00:53:53,079
... you're certain of

642
00:53:56,290 --> 00:54:01,205
And let your heart decide

643
00:54:01,890 --> 00:54:04,609
When you're...

644
00:54:05,170 --> 00:54:08,924
...in love

645
00:54:16,570 --> 00:54:18,765
I guess I got the beginnings.

646
00:54:19,890 --> 00:54:23,565
But them townspeople will never let us
court them gals now.

647
00:54:24,330 --> 00:54:26,969
-Not after today.
-Don't let it fret you.

648
00:54:27,170 --> 00:54:29,809
If you don't get this one,
another will come along.

649
00:54:30,050 --> 00:54:32,359
One woman's pretty much like the next.

650
00:54:32,610 --> 00:54:34,965
Come on, let's go feed the stock.

651
00:55:29,107 --> 00:55:30,335
I'm...

652
00:55:31,827 --> 00:55:35,786
...a lonesome polecat

653
00:55:37,427 --> 00:55:39,463
Lonesome...

654
00:55:39,707 --> 00:55:44,178
...sad and blue

655
00:55:45,427 --> 00:55:50,137
'Cause I ain't got no

656
00:55:51,187 --> 00:55:53,747
Feminine polecat

657
00:55:55,427 --> 00:55:58,658
Vowin' to be true

658
00:56:09,707 --> 00:56:12,346
Can't make no vows

659
00:56:13,307 --> 00:56:17,016
To a herd of cows

660
00:56:23,867 --> 00:56:25,619
I'm...

661
00:56:26,347 --> 00:56:30,306
...a mean old hound dog

662
00:56:32,107 --> 00:56:37,022
Bayin' at the moon

663
00:56:40,027 --> 00:56:43,815
'Cause I ain't got no

664
00:56:45,747 --> 00:56:48,420
Lady friend hound dog

665
00:56:50,107 --> 00:56:53,895
Here to hear my tune

666
00:57:04,307 --> 00:57:06,980
A man can't sleep

667
00:57:07,987 --> 00:57:12,503
When he sleeps with sheep

668
00:57:18,667 --> 00:57:20,259
I'm...

669
00:57:21,227 --> 00:57:25,140
...a little old hoot owl

670
00:57:27,107 --> 00:57:32,022
Hootin' in the trees

671
00:57:34,987 --> 00:57:38,946
'Cause I ain't got no

672
00:57:40,867 --> 00:57:43,335
Little gal owl fowl

673
00:57:45,147 --> 00:57:48,856
Here to shoot the breeze

674
00:57:59,467 --> 00:58:02,777
Can't shoot no breeze

675
00:58:03,227 --> 00:58:06,856
With a bunch of trees

676
00:58:47,747 --> 00:58:49,226
It is beautiful, isn't it?

677
00:58:49,467 --> 00:58:50,980
Not to me.

678
00:58:51,227 --> 00:58:53,183
I've seen too much of it.

679
00:58:53,787 --> 00:58:55,186
I'm getting out.

680
00:58:56,547 --> 00:58:59,778
I'm not spending another
winter here, snowed in for months.

681
00:59:00,027 --> 00:59:02,177
What would we do without you?

682
00:59:02,587 --> 00:59:03,702
We'd miss you so.

683
00:59:03,947 --> 00:59:07,178
There's plenty here
to take care of the farm without me.

684
00:59:19,347 --> 00:59:20,666
Adam!

685
00:59:22,547 --> 00:59:24,583
-Benjamin says he's leaving.
-What?

686
00:59:24,787 --> 00:59:26,778
He says it's the winter,
but it's not.

687
00:59:27,027 --> 00:59:29,587
They're all grieving for their girls.

688
00:59:29,827 --> 00:59:32,421
Why should they grieve?
They hardly saw them once.

689
00:59:33,827 --> 00:59:36,466
Once is all it takes
if it's the right one.

690
00:59:36,707 --> 00:59:39,904
I had such dreams about all of them
living around.

691
00:59:40,147 --> 00:59:44,857
Dozens of children, visiting back
and forth at Christmas and birthdays.

692
00:59:45,107 --> 00:59:47,257
If Benjamin goes,
then another will go.

693
00:59:47,507 --> 00:59:48,735
And another.

694
00:59:50,867 --> 00:59:52,585
I'll talk to him.

695
01:00:09,147 --> 01:00:11,786
If you could just get a look at
yourselves....

696
01:00:11,987 --> 01:00:15,184
You look like
a bunch of lovesick bull calves.

697
01:00:19,267 --> 01:00:22,498
If you're sweet on them,
why don't you do something about it?

698
01:00:22,747 --> 01:00:24,180
Why don't you go marry them?

699
01:00:24,427 --> 01:00:26,622
Sure, "Go marry them," as easy as that!

700
01:00:27,147 --> 01:00:29,422
They wouldn't marry us
in a thousand years.

701
01:00:29,667 --> 01:00:33,023
Do as the Romans did with the
"Sobbing Women" or "Sabine Women"...

702
01:00:33,347 --> 01:00:37,056
...or whatever they called them.
They were in the same fix you're in.

703
01:00:37,307 --> 01:00:41,220
They was opening up new territory,
and women were scarce, like here.

704
01:00:41,667 --> 01:00:43,976
There were these sobbing women
in town.

705
01:00:44,187 --> 01:00:45,586
So what did the Romans do?

706
01:00:45,787 --> 01:00:48,779
They went down there,
and they carried them off.

707
01:00:49,027 --> 01:00:53,259
If you can't do as good as a bunch of
Romans, you're no brothers of mine.

708
01:00:53,507 --> 01:00:56,624
Course, this being Oregon
and God-fearing territory...

709
01:00:56,867 --> 01:00:58,823
...you'd have to capture a parson.

710
01:00:59,067 --> 01:01:02,377
Romans. They the ones I heard
about settled north of here?

711
01:01:02,627 --> 01:01:04,026
No, this was in olden days.

712
01:01:04,267 --> 01:01:05,985
I read about it in Milly's book.

713
01:01:06,187 --> 01:01:08,576
-A book!
-Why, this is history.

714
01:01:08,787 --> 01:01:10,015
This really happened.

715
01:01:10,267 --> 01:01:14,783
Tell you about them sobbin' women
Who lived in the Roman days

716
01:01:14,987 --> 01:01:19,424
It seems that they all went swimmin'
While their men was off to graze

717
01:01:19,667 --> 01:01:24,058
Well a Roman troop was riding by
And saw them in their "me-oh-mys"

718
01:01:24,307 --> 01:01:26,662
So they took them all
Back home to dry

719
01:01:26,907 --> 01:01:29,296
Least that's what Plutarch says

720
01:01:29,547 --> 01:01:31,822
Them women was
Sobbin', sobbin', sobbin'

721
01:01:32,067 --> 01:01:33,546
Fit to be tied

722
01:01:34,107 --> 01:01:38,498
Every muscle was throbbin', throbbin'
From that riotous ride

723
01:01:38,747 --> 01:01:41,500
Seems they cried and kissed
And kissed and cried

724
01:01:41,747 --> 01:01:43,703
All over that Roman countryside

725
01:01:43,947 --> 01:01:46,302
So don't forget that

726
01:01:46,547 --> 01:01:48,503
When you're taking a bride

727
01:01:48,747 --> 01:01:50,863
Sobbin', fit to be tied

728
01:01:51,107 --> 01:01:53,302
From that riotous ride

729
01:01:53,547 --> 01:01:56,266
-So then what happened?
-Gather round, I'll tell you.

730
01:01:56,507 --> 01:01:58,623
They never did return their plunder

731
01:01:58,867 --> 01:02:00,903
The victor gets all the loot

732
01:02:01,147 --> 01:02:03,058
They carried them home by thunder

733
01:02:03,307 --> 01:02:05,582
To rotundas small but cute

734
01:02:05,827 --> 01:02:07,897
And you've never seen,
So they tell me

735
01:02:08,147 --> 01:02:10,297
Such downright domesticity

736
01:02:10,547 --> 01:02:12,458
With a Roman baby on each knee

737
01:02:12,707 --> 01:02:15,380
Named Claudius and Brute

738
01:02:15,667 --> 01:02:17,897
Them women was
Sobbin', sobbin', sobbin'

739
01:02:18,147 --> 01:02:19,899
Passin' them nights

740
01:02:20,147 --> 01:02:23,583
While the Romans was out
Hobnobbin', starting up fights

741
01:02:23,787 --> 01:02:24,583
Is that so?

742
01:02:24,827 --> 01:02:28,786
They kept occupied by sewing lots
Of little old togas...

743
01:02:28,987 --> 01:02:32,297
...for them tots
And sayin', "Someday...

744
01:02:32,547 --> 01:02:34,697
... womenfolks will have rights"

745
01:02:34,947 --> 01:02:36,858
-Passin' all their nights
-Just sewing!

746
01:02:37,107 --> 01:02:40,099
-While the Romans had fights
-Listen to this.

747
01:02:40,347 --> 01:02:42,656
"When the menfolk
Went to fetch them

748
01:02:42,907 --> 01:02:44,784
The women would not be fetched"

749
01:02:45,027 --> 01:02:48,656
Seems when the Romans catch 'em
Their lady friends stay catched

750
01:02:49,467 --> 01:02:51,662
Now, let this be
Because it's true

751
01:02:51,907 --> 01:02:53,818
A lesson to the likes of you

752
01:02:54,067 --> 01:02:56,058
Rough 'em up
Like them there Romans do

753
01:02:56,307 --> 01:02:58,980
Or else they'll think you're tetched

754
01:02:59,187 --> 01:03:01,496
Them women was
Sobbin', sobbin', sobbin'

755
01:03:01,747 --> 01:03:03,499
-Buckets of tears
-Mighty sad!

756
01:03:03,747 --> 01:03:07,183
On account of old dobbin, dobbin
Really rattled their ears

757
01:03:07,427 --> 01:03:11,102
And that ain't all!
Oh, they acted angry and annoyed

758
01:03:11,347 --> 01:03:13,258
But secretly they was overjoyed

759
01:03:13,507 --> 01:03:17,261
You might recall that
When corrallin' your steers

760
01:03:18,587 --> 01:03:19,781
Them poor little dears

761
01:03:20,027 --> 01:03:22,063
Why are you sitting there?
Go get them!

762
01:03:23,147 --> 01:03:25,456
Them women was
Sobbin', sobbin', sobbin'

763
01:03:25,667 --> 01:03:27,578
-Weepin' a ton
-Them sobbin' women

764
01:03:27,827 --> 01:03:30,500
Just remember what
Robin, Robin, Robin Hood...

765
01:03:30,707 --> 01:03:32,379
... would have done

766
01:03:32,587 --> 01:03:35,385
We'll be just like
Them there merry men

767
01:03:35,587 --> 01:03:37,464
And make them all merry once again

768
01:03:37,707 --> 01:03:41,063
And though they'll be
A-sobbin' for a while

769
01:03:42,027 --> 01:03:46,942
We're gonna make them
Sobbin' women smile

770
01:04:00,427 --> 01:04:01,621
Ho there.

771
01:04:03,027 --> 01:04:04,983
Go get them.
Be quiet about it.

772
01:04:05,467 --> 01:04:06,980
I'll wait for you here!

773
01:04:14,187 --> 01:04:15,461
Dan, Eph!

774
01:04:18,147 --> 01:04:19,978
Your two's in here.

775
01:04:22,267 --> 01:04:23,666
They're coming out.

776
01:04:24,147 --> 01:04:25,978
-Good night, Liza.
-Good night.

777
01:04:31,867 --> 01:04:33,380
You got mine.

778
01:04:37,267 --> 01:04:39,098
How about my good-night kiss, Sarah?

779
01:04:39,347 --> 01:04:40,985
Carl, you're so persistent.

780
01:04:41,187 --> 01:04:42,779
Be a sport! Just one kiss.

781
01:04:42,987 --> 01:04:45,421
Well, maybe just a little one.

782
01:04:45,627 --> 01:04:46,980
Close your eyes.

783
01:04:51,867 --> 01:04:53,266
Why, Carl!

784
01:04:53,627 --> 01:04:54,776
Frank!

785
01:05:02,027 --> 01:05:03,380
Attaboy! Get them in.

786
01:05:05,267 --> 01:05:06,586
Come on, Frank!

787
01:05:08,307 --> 01:05:09,103
Where's Gideon?

788
01:05:14,467 --> 01:05:17,982
-I hear the cat outside.
-I'll go, Mrs. Elcott.

789
01:05:18,667 --> 01:05:20,703
Poor Pansy, out on a night like this.

790
01:05:36,427 --> 01:05:38,179
Hurry it up, will you?

791
01:05:44,827 --> 01:05:48,581
-Sounds like Pansy has the croup.
-I'll look out in back.

792
01:05:52,027 --> 01:05:53,619
It's all right, she's here.

793
01:06:07,387 --> 01:06:08,456
Dorcas.

794
01:06:08,987 --> 01:06:10,261
Dorcas!

795
01:06:10,867 --> 01:06:12,664
Pa! Pa, come quick!

796
01:06:14,507 --> 01:06:15,462
Attaboy, Gideon!

797
01:06:30,347 --> 01:06:32,383
-What's keeping Benjamin?
-I don't know.

798
01:06:34,627 --> 01:06:36,379
-Keep them quiet.
-Be quiet.

799
01:06:36,587 --> 01:06:38,145
Let's get out of here now.

800
01:06:38,347 --> 01:06:39,575
Let's go!

801
01:06:52,187 --> 01:06:54,018
-Sarah Kines is gone!
-So is Alice.

802
01:06:54,267 --> 01:06:56,417
-Ruth Jebson too!
-Where's Dorcas?

803
01:06:56,667 --> 01:06:59,420
It was them Pontipees.
All seven of them jumped me!

804
01:06:59,667 --> 01:07:01,737
Come on! We'll get them.

805
01:07:50,867 --> 01:07:53,176
Make them stop yelling.
We're coming to the pass.

806
01:07:53,427 --> 01:07:55,702
Quiet, or we'll have
an avalanche down on us.

807
01:08:00,787 --> 01:08:02,778
Here we go. Hold your breath.

808
01:08:17,787 --> 01:08:19,186
Keep her quiet!

809
01:08:24,867 --> 01:08:26,539
Hurry up,
I hear them coming!

810
01:08:55,747 --> 01:08:57,180
All right, let them go!

811
01:09:10,067 --> 01:09:11,216
There she goes!

812
01:10:30,827 --> 01:10:34,456
On account of old dobbin, dobbin
Really rattled their ears

813
01:10:37,067 --> 01:10:38,785
All right, boys, line them up.

814
01:10:39,027 --> 01:10:40,460
Oh, Milly!

815
01:10:42,547 --> 01:10:44,026
What have you done?

816
01:10:44,227 --> 01:10:46,422
Help us, Milly.
We've been kidnapped!

817
01:10:46,627 --> 01:10:50,017
-Make them take us back.
-You take these girls back at once!

818
01:10:50,227 --> 01:10:51,580
-We can't.
-The avalanche!

819
01:10:51,827 --> 01:10:54,785
They'll just have to wait
till spring, that's all.

820
01:10:55,747 --> 01:10:56,862
It was your idea?

821
01:10:57,147 --> 01:11:01,379
It was more yours. It came out of
that book about them Sabine women.

822
01:11:01,627 --> 01:11:05,620
What kind of men are you?
Are you animals that you'd do this?

823
01:11:05,867 --> 01:11:08,176
Swooping down,
carrying off poor innocents!

824
01:11:08,427 --> 01:11:10,418
They're just young boys in love.

825
01:11:10,667 --> 01:11:13,818
You said you wanted them
married with wives of their own.

826
01:11:14,067 --> 01:11:15,625
I want my mother!

827
01:11:17,187 --> 01:11:18,586
Please don't cry, Alice.

828
01:11:18,787 --> 01:11:21,984
I'm sorry, but it was the only way
I could get to marry you.

829
01:11:24,067 --> 01:11:26,786
-What?
-We forgot to get the parson!

830
01:11:27,227 --> 01:11:30,378
Don't worry. Go on in the kitchen.
Nothing's gonna happen.

831
01:11:30,627 --> 01:11:32,379
Cheer up.
You've got them, right?

832
01:11:32,587 --> 01:11:34,578
Everything's gonna
turn out all right.

833
01:11:34,787 --> 01:11:36,584
This house is for the girls.

834
01:11:36,787 --> 01:11:39,984
You're not gonna set foot in it
as long as they're here.

835
01:11:40,227 --> 01:11:43,424
You'll eat and sleep in the barn
with the other livestock.

836
01:11:43,667 --> 01:11:45,020
Now get out of here.

837
01:11:45,227 --> 01:11:46,819
I'm ashamed of you.

838
01:11:47,067 --> 01:11:48,978
Go ahead, boys. Go on.

839
01:11:50,347 --> 01:11:51,985
-Now, Milly--
-You too.

840
01:11:52,227 --> 01:11:55,219
You're taking this too hard.
Everything will work out fine.

841
01:11:55,467 --> 01:11:57,776
Me and the boys will get
a parson here some way.

842
01:11:58,067 --> 01:12:00,979
Do you think those girls
would marry them now?

843
01:12:01,787 --> 01:12:03,982
You think because
you got a wife so easily...

844
01:12:04,187 --> 01:12:07,975
...because I didn't make you court me,
that that's all there is to it?

845
01:12:08,387 --> 01:12:12,619
I said yes because I fell in love
with you the first time I saw you.

846
01:12:13,387 --> 01:12:15,617
And I thought it was
the same with you too.

847
01:12:15,867 --> 01:12:17,778
You think a wife is
just to cook and clean.

848
01:12:18,227 --> 01:12:21,378
You got no understanding,
you got no feelings!

849
01:12:21,587 --> 01:12:24,181
How could you do a thing like this?

850
01:12:24,587 --> 01:12:26,896
When I think of these girls,
sick with fright...

851
01:12:27,147 --> 01:12:29,581
...and their families
crazed with worry, and--

852
01:12:29,987 --> 01:12:32,023
I can't abide to look at you!

853
01:12:45,747 --> 01:12:49,786
This isn't the way we'd planned
on spending the night. In a barn!

854
01:12:52,667 --> 01:12:54,976
-What are you doing?
-I'm getting out of here.

855
01:12:55,227 --> 01:12:57,024
Going to the cabin
for the winter.

856
01:12:57,267 --> 01:13:00,179
You can't do it.
You can't stay up there alone.

857
01:13:00,387 --> 01:13:02,218
There's supplies for 6 months.

858
01:13:02,427 --> 01:13:04,782
Don't go.
It's us she's mad at.

859
01:13:05,867 --> 01:13:09,576
No, it's more than that.
It's something goes a lot deeper.

860
01:13:09,827 --> 01:13:13,581
Suppose you get sick or break a leg
or something, up there all alone?

861
01:13:13,787 --> 01:13:15,823
The wolves are
mighty bad this year.

862
01:13:16,067 --> 01:13:19,377
The wolves will be good company
after what I've been through.

863
01:13:27,787 --> 01:13:31,575
There's nothing like a hot cup of tea
when you're all tuckered out.

864
01:13:32,947 --> 01:13:35,461
Milly, it's me, Gideon.
I gotta speak to you.

865
01:13:39,547 --> 01:13:41,219
-What is it?
-It's about Adam.

866
01:13:41,427 --> 01:13:44,783
He's going away up into the mountains
to the trapping cabin.

867
01:13:45,387 --> 01:13:47,981
-Can you hear me?
-I hear.

868
01:13:48,347 --> 01:13:50,303
Just speak to him.
Ask him not to go.

869
01:13:51,187 --> 01:13:52,779
Please, Milly.

870
01:13:54,547 --> 01:13:56,663
He can't treat people this way.

871
01:14:18,347 --> 01:14:20,178
Now, let's start here.

872
01:14:58,587 --> 01:15:00,976
What's the matter,
you afraid of a snowball?

873
01:15:07,187 --> 01:15:09,382
Snowballs with rocks in them!

874
01:15:09,587 --> 01:15:11,623
"Them poor little dears...

875
01:15:11,827 --> 01:15:14,387
...sobbing buckets of tears."

876
01:15:17,547 --> 01:15:21,222
"When the sign was given, drawing
their swords and with a shout...

877
01:15:21,427 --> 01:15:23,987
...they ravished away
the daughters of the Sabine."

878
01:15:24,587 --> 01:15:25,986
Who is it?

879
01:15:27,427 --> 01:15:29,258
It's me, Caleb.

880
01:15:30,427 --> 01:15:31,223
What do you want?

881
01:15:32,227 --> 01:15:34,377
It's a mighty cold night.

882
01:15:35,147 --> 01:15:36,785
I need an extra blanket.

883
01:15:38,787 --> 01:15:39,583
Go and get one.

884
01:15:48,867 --> 01:15:52,177
"It continues the custom today
for the bride, not of herself...

885
01:15:52,387 --> 01:15:55,026
...to pass her husband's threshold,
but to be lifted over...

886
01:15:55,267 --> 01:15:58,782
...in memory that the Sabine women
were carried in by violence."

887
01:16:00,027 --> 01:16:01,380
Who is it?

888
01:16:01,867 --> 01:16:03,016
Benjamin.

889
01:16:04,467 --> 01:16:05,980
What do you want?

890
01:16:06,267 --> 01:16:08,781
My leg is feeling poorly.

891
01:16:09,027 --> 01:16:10,176
I need some liniment.

892
01:16:12,467 --> 01:16:14,298
Go ahead, but be quick about it.

893
01:16:27,467 --> 01:16:28,786
"Some say too...

894
01:16:29,027 --> 01:16:33,179
...the custom of parting the bride's
hair with a spear was in token of--"

895
01:16:38,027 --> 01:16:40,780
-I got me a stiff neck.
-That's enough of this!

896
01:16:40,987 --> 01:16:42,306
-We wanted--
-It was like this--

897
01:16:42,547 --> 01:16:44,299
Go to the barn
and go to sleep...

898
01:16:44,547 --> 01:16:46,378
...or I'll bolt the door on you.

899
01:16:56,867 --> 01:16:59,222
"It was in token of their marriages.

900
01:16:59,467 --> 01:17:03,221
It began at first by wars
and acts of hostility...

901
01:17:03,467 --> 01:17:04,820
...and then--"

902
01:17:22,267 --> 01:17:24,701
Doesn't it do anything
but snow up here?

903
01:17:24,947 --> 01:17:27,586
We've had a blizzard every day
for two months.

904
01:17:27,787 --> 01:17:30,585
I'm going crazy,
shut up in this house!

905
01:17:30,827 --> 01:17:33,705
Alice, why don't you
read out loud to us?

906
01:17:33,947 --> 01:17:35,824
We've heard that book three times.

907
01:17:36,067 --> 01:17:39,503
-Go on, read about the Sabine women.
-Please, Alice.

908
01:17:39,747 --> 01:17:41,100
I can't stand it again.

909
01:17:41,347 --> 01:17:43,417
Get a dress from Milly,
and I'll fit it.

910
01:17:43,667 --> 01:17:45,817
Why, when there's no one to see it?

911
01:17:46,067 --> 01:17:49,980
No one? Well, I like that!
We're no one.

912
01:17:50,227 --> 01:17:53,424
-Where's Milly?
-Out in the barn hunting eggs.

913
01:17:53,667 --> 01:17:58,058
I wish I could hunt eggs.
I love to hunt eggs.

914
01:17:58,347 --> 01:18:01,578
Which of the boys slept
in this bed, do you suppose?

915
01:18:02,547 --> 01:18:03,741
Dorcas Galen!

916
01:18:04,947 --> 01:18:07,381
What's the matter?
Didn't you ever think of that?

917
01:18:07,587 --> 01:18:10,181
That you're sleeping
in one of their beds?

918
01:18:10,587 --> 01:18:13,385
I certainly never thought
any such thing.

919
01:18:13,667 --> 01:18:15,225
Liza, Alice...

920
01:18:15,467 --> 01:18:17,981
...come away from
that window this minute!

921
01:18:18,187 --> 01:18:22,021
I think it's disgusting standing there
where they can see you.

922
01:18:22,267 --> 01:18:25,896
You peek out often enough
when you think no one's looking.

923
01:18:26,147 --> 01:18:27,785
-I never!
-I saw you!

924
01:18:28,267 --> 01:18:29,063
So did l!

925
01:18:29,267 --> 01:18:31,178
You take that back, you hear?

926
01:18:31,467 --> 01:18:32,456
Stop it!

927
01:18:32,667 --> 01:18:34,976
Don't you dare say that about Martha!

928
01:18:35,187 --> 01:18:38,782
And what were you doing last night
out at the woodpile?

929
01:18:47,667 --> 01:18:49,623
Girls! Girls!

930
01:18:50,067 --> 01:18:51,785
Stop it this minute!

931
01:18:54,947 --> 01:18:58,826
Please don't squabble.
Not now, when I need you so much.

932
01:18:59,027 --> 01:19:02,383
You see, I'm counting on
all of you to help me...

933
01:19:02,867 --> 01:19:04,778
...because I'm going to have a baby.

934
01:19:06,267 --> 01:19:07,825
Oh, Milly, sit down!

935
01:19:08,027 --> 01:19:11,099
-Are you comfortable?
-You won't lift a finger from now on.

936
01:19:11,347 --> 01:19:15,420
We'll take over everything. We'll do
your chores, cleaning, cooking....

937
01:19:15,667 --> 01:19:17,419
No, you can't.
That'd be silly.

938
01:19:17,667 --> 01:19:20,101
-Where are you going?
-I have things to do.

939
01:19:20,347 --> 01:19:21,985
When's the baby coming?

940
01:19:22,227 --> 01:19:23,421
You have to be patient.

941
01:19:23,667 --> 01:19:24,986
But when?

942
01:19:25,747 --> 01:19:27,385
In the spring.

943
01:19:31,547 --> 01:19:34,220
-I wish it was me.
-Dorcas!

944
01:19:34,427 --> 01:19:36,543
I've always wanted
to be a June bride...

945
01:19:37,147 --> 01:19:41,026
...and have a baby right off.
In the spring, maybe.

946
01:19:43,267 --> 01:19:47,180
Oh, they say when you marry in June

947
01:19:47,387 --> 01:19:51,380
You're a bride all your life

948
01:19:51,587 --> 01:19:55,375
And the bridegroom
Who marries in June

949
01:19:55,627 --> 01:19:59,256
Gets a sweetheart for a wife

950
01:19:59,667 --> 01:20:03,296
Winter weddings can be gay

951
01:20:03,747 --> 01:20:07,706
Like a Christmas holiday

952
01:20:07,947 --> 01:20:11,656
But the June bride hears the song

953
01:20:12,147 --> 01:20:15,981
Of a spring that
Lasts all summer long

954
01:20:16,267 --> 01:20:19,896
By the light of the silvery moon

955
01:20:20,587 --> 01:20:22,225
Home you ride

956
01:20:22,667 --> 01:20:24,464
Side by side

957
01:20:24,747 --> 01:20:28,376
With the echo of Mendelssohn's tune

958
01:20:28,827 --> 01:20:30,624
In your hearts

959
01:20:30,867 --> 01:20:32,425
As you ride

960
01:20:33,027 --> 01:20:36,815
For they say when you marry in June

961
01:20:37,067 --> 01:20:41,026
You will always be a bride

962
01:20:44,787 --> 01:20:46,425
The day a maiden marries

963
01:20:46,627 --> 01:20:50,176
Is a day she carries through the years

964
01:20:50,427 --> 01:20:54,386
The church is full of flowers
Bridal showers are passe

965
01:20:55,747 --> 01:20:58,136
The groom's waiting at the altar

966
01:20:58,347 --> 01:21:00,303
Here comes the bride

967
01:21:00,547 --> 01:21:04,096
They're each promising
To love and obey

968
01:21:05,787 --> 01:21:07,539
Best man is celebrating

969
01:21:07,747 --> 01:21:11,296
Every bridesmaid's waiting
Just to see

970
01:21:11,547 --> 01:21:15,256
Which one of them
Will catch the wedding bouquet

971
01:22:02,867 --> 01:22:04,823
For they say

972
01:22:05,067 --> 01:22:07,900
When you marry in June

973
01:22:08,787 --> 01:22:11,699
You will always

974
01:22:14,867 --> 01:22:16,903
Always

975
01:22:20,747 --> 01:22:23,022
Be a bride

976
01:22:37,027 --> 01:22:40,702
In November, the snow starts to fly

977
01:22:41,067 --> 01:22:42,500
Piling up

978
01:22:43,067 --> 01:22:44,739
Ankle-high

979
01:22:45,147 --> 01:22:48,537
Come December, it's up to your knee

980
01:22:48,987 --> 01:22:52,297
Still, the bride's a bride-to-be

981
01:22:52,987 --> 01:22:56,457
January, higher still

982
01:22:57,027 --> 01:23:00,099
To the parlor windowsill

983
01:23:00,987 --> 01:23:04,297
February finds a drift

984
01:23:04,947 --> 01:23:08,781
And a storm that seems never to lift

985
01:23:09,347 --> 01:23:12,976
March comes in like a lion--
What else?

986
01:23:13,267 --> 01:23:17,021
Still the snow never melts

987
01:23:17,387 --> 01:23:19,423
April showers will come

988
01:23:19,667 --> 01:23:21,225
So they say

989
01:23:21,467 --> 01:23:25,016
But they don't
And it's May

990
01:23:25,547 --> 01:23:29,017
You're about to
Forget the whole thing

991
01:23:36,867 --> 01:23:38,903
All at once

992
01:23:39,267 --> 01:23:42,862
One day it's spring

993
01:24:15,867 --> 01:24:19,621
Oh, the barnyard is busy
ln a regular tizzy

994
01:24:19,867 --> 01:24:24,179
And the obvious reason
ls because of the season

995
01:24:24,427 --> 01:24:28,022
Ma Nature's lyrical
With her yearly miracle

996
01:24:28,227 --> 01:24:31,378
Spring, spring, spring

997
01:24:31,867 --> 01:24:35,621
All the hen-folk are hatchin'
While their menfolk are scratchin'

998
01:24:35,867 --> 01:24:40,179
To ensure the survival
Of each brand-new arrival

999
01:24:40,387 --> 01:24:44,016
Each nest is twitterin'
They're all babysitterin'

1000
01:24:44,267 --> 01:24:47,464
Spring, spring, spring

1001
01:24:47,867 --> 01:24:51,621
It's a beehive
Of budding son and daughter life

1002
01:24:51,867 --> 01:24:54,984
Every family has plans in view

1003
01:24:55,867 --> 01:24:59,576
Even down in the brook
The underwater life

1004
01:24:59,867 --> 01:25:03,018
Is forever blowing bubbles too

1005
01:25:03,827 --> 01:25:07,786
Every field wears a bonnet
With some spring daisies on it

1006
01:25:07,987 --> 01:25:12,185
Even birds of a feather
Show their clothes off together

1007
01:25:12,387 --> 01:25:16,175
Sun's getting shinery
To spotlight the finery

1008
01:25:16,387 --> 01:25:19,060
Spring, spring, spring

1009
01:25:19,827 --> 01:25:23,376
From his aerie
The eagle with his eagle eye

1010
01:25:23,827 --> 01:25:26,739
Gazes down across his eagle beak

1011
01:25:27,827 --> 01:25:31,376
And affixin' his lady
With a legal eye

1012
01:25:31,707 --> 01:25:35,017
Screams, "Suppose
we set the date this week?"

1013
01:25:39,747 --> 01:25:43,706
Yes, sirree, spring discloses
That it's all one supposes

1014
01:25:43,947 --> 01:25:48,020
It's a real bed of roses
Waggin' tails, rubbing noses

1015
01:25:48,267 --> 01:25:51,896
Each day is Mother's Day
The next is some other's day

1016
01:25:52,147 --> 01:25:55,059
When love is king

1017
01:25:55,867 --> 01:25:57,539
Frank, Dan, Ben, Caleb!

1018
01:25:57,867 --> 01:26:00,256
Everybody!
Milly's having her baby!

1019
01:26:26,667 --> 01:26:28,578
Liza, Martha, Ruth, hurry!

1020
01:26:29,027 --> 01:26:30,016
Hurry!

1021
01:26:56,827 --> 01:26:58,180
I'm an uncle.

1022
01:28:00,027 --> 01:28:02,382
Couldn't stand the barn
any longer, huh?

1023
01:28:02,867 --> 01:28:06,177
I've come to get you.
To take you back with me.

1024
01:28:09,787 --> 01:28:11,584
Well, Milly has a baby.

1025
01:28:11,827 --> 01:28:13,977
It come day before yesterday.

1026
01:28:16,027 --> 01:28:17,585
I don't believe it.

1027
01:28:18,067 --> 01:28:20,979
-It's as true as I'm standing here.
-I don't believe it!

1028
01:28:21,267 --> 01:28:23,542
Just one of her tricks
to get me back.

1029
01:28:23,747 --> 01:28:26,215
Tricks? You lived with Milly
as man and wife...

1030
01:28:26,467 --> 01:28:28,298
...and you don't know
nothing about her.

1031
01:28:28,547 --> 01:28:32,984
She's proud and spunky! She'd never
bring herself to ask you back.

1032
01:28:33,187 --> 01:28:35,178
She'd be wasting her breath.

1033
01:28:36,427 --> 01:28:37,576
I don't figure to go.

1034
01:28:37,827 --> 01:28:42,139
Not even to see the baby?
Your own kin? Your own little girl?

1035
01:28:42,347 --> 01:28:43,666
A girl?

1036
01:28:44,267 --> 01:28:46,781
I might have known she'd have a girl.

1037
01:28:47,587 --> 01:28:49,543
I'll be back when the pass is open.

1038
01:28:49,747 --> 01:28:52,386
I'll stay away
till the shooting's over.

1039
01:28:55,027 --> 01:28:56,779
You're my eldest brother.

1040
01:28:57,627 --> 01:29:00,585
And I've always looked up to you,
tried to ape you...

1041
01:29:01,267 --> 01:29:03,383
...but today I'm ashamed for you.

1042
01:29:04,667 --> 01:29:07,420
I know you can lick me,
lick the tar out of me...

1043
01:29:07,667 --> 01:29:11,023
...but I wouldn't be a man
unless I showed you how I felt.

1044
01:29:11,947 --> 01:29:12,982
Why, you--

1045
01:29:20,427 --> 01:29:21,462
Now get!

1046
01:29:35,347 --> 01:29:37,781
The pass is open!
The pass is open!

1047
01:29:37,987 --> 01:29:41,184
All able-bodied men gather
at the meeting house!

1048
01:29:43,667 --> 01:29:48,104
Bring your rifles, your sides,
your guns, axes, any kind of weapon!

1049
01:29:48,667 --> 01:29:50,942
The pass is open!
The pass is open!

1050
01:29:51,787 --> 01:29:52,583
Ready, men?

1051
01:29:53,547 --> 01:29:54,775
Let's go!

1052
01:30:18,187 --> 01:30:19,984
What are you staring at?

1053
01:30:20,467 --> 01:30:23,061
I said I'd be back
when the pass was open.

1054
01:30:26,067 --> 01:30:28,786
Go upstairs, girls.
Go on. Quickly!

1055
01:30:31,627 --> 01:30:33,185
Let's get the guns.

1056
01:30:35,227 --> 01:30:37,183
Tell them to hitch up the wagon.

1057
01:30:37,987 --> 01:30:40,376
Put plenty of blankets
and straw in it. Go.

1058
01:31:13,067 --> 01:31:14,580
What do you call her?

1059
01:31:15,947 --> 01:31:20,384
I was thinking of some name
like Hannah or Hagar or Hephzibah...

1060
01:31:20,867 --> 01:31:23,381
...picking up
where your mother left off.

1061
01:31:25,227 --> 01:31:26,580
Hannah.

1062
01:31:31,027 --> 01:31:33,587
I got to thinking
up there in the mountains...

1063
01:31:34,147 --> 01:31:35,978
...thinking about the baby...

1064
01:31:38,867 --> 01:31:42,576
...about how I'd feel if somebody
sneaked in and carried her off.

1065
01:31:43,747 --> 01:31:45,624
I'd string him up
the nearest tree...

1066
01:31:45,827 --> 01:31:48,580
...shoot him down like I would
a thieving fox.

1067
01:31:51,667 --> 01:31:54,181
I thought about you too
while I was up there.

1068
01:31:56,467 --> 01:31:59,027
It seemed like I couldn't
get you off my mind.

1069
01:32:02,467 --> 01:32:04,378
When you're in love....

1070
01:32:05,387 --> 01:32:07,184
When you're really in love....

1071
01:32:21,627 --> 01:32:23,379
The wagon's ready.

1072
01:32:23,867 --> 01:32:25,186
All right.

1073
01:32:25,787 --> 01:32:27,743
Get the girls.
I'll take them back...

1074
01:32:27,947 --> 01:32:29,585
...back to their families.

1075
01:32:33,547 --> 01:32:35,583
Adam, you will be careful?

1076
01:32:43,187 --> 01:32:44,825
We won't let you take them back.

1077
01:32:45,067 --> 01:32:47,945
-We talked it over and we're agreed.
-They ain't going.

1078
01:32:48,267 --> 01:32:50,258
They're our girls now.

1079
01:32:53,147 --> 01:32:56,264
I'm taking them back.
I'm still head of this family.

1080
01:32:57,747 --> 01:32:59,499
I reckon you'll have to show me.

1081
01:32:59,747 --> 01:33:00,975
Likewise.

1082
01:33:03,547 --> 01:33:06,778
What do I have to do,
beat some sense into your dumb heads?

1083
01:33:07,027 --> 01:33:08,858
Taking them back's the only way.

1084
01:33:09,547 --> 01:33:11,981
-The whole town's coming here.
-Let them come.

1085
01:33:12,187 --> 01:33:13,984
We'll fight them all.

1086
01:33:15,627 --> 01:33:18,016
Sure you will.
And who will you be fighting?

1087
01:33:18,267 --> 01:33:19,746
The girls' kinfolk.

1088
01:33:19,947 --> 01:33:22,780
Someone's bound to get hurt.
A father, a brother.

1089
01:33:24,667 --> 01:33:26,976
Think the girls will
marry you after that?

1090
01:33:33,667 --> 01:33:35,180
Adam's right.

1091
01:33:35,867 --> 01:33:37,585
I stand with Adam.

1092
01:33:38,427 --> 01:33:40,179
Well, don't stand too close.

1093
01:33:41,267 --> 01:33:43,337
The girls have gone.
They've run away!

1094
01:33:43,867 --> 01:33:46,062
Go get them. Get them back.

1095
01:33:46,667 --> 01:33:48,020
Come back here!

1096
01:33:53,827 --> 01:33:56,387
Dorcas!
Come back. You'll get hurt.

1097
01:33:59,587 --> 01:34:01,976
Keep it quiet.
They can hear us from here.

1098
01:34:02,187 --> 01:34:03,779
We'll creep up on them.

1099
01:34:05,827 --> 01:34:07,021
Please, Alice!

1100
01:34:07,227 --> 01:34:10,776
Where are you? Come back, Martha.
Don't run away.

1101
01:34:13,067 --> 01:34:15,820
I'm not going back!
I want to stay here with you!

1102
01:34:16,067 --> 01:34:18,376
You've got to.
It's the only way.

1103
01:34:21,147 --> 01:34:22,296
It's Alice!

1104
01:34:22,587 --> 01:34:23,940
Come on, Ruth.

1105
01:34:32,227 --> 01:34:33,580
There they are!

1106
01:34:47,747 --> 01:34:49,738
Don't. You'll hit Dorcas.

1107
01:35:00,267 --> 01:35:01,666
Oh, no....

1108
01:35:02,267 --> 01:35:03,780
Not that!

1109
01:35:15,507 --> 01:35:16,303
Grab her dress!

1110
01:35:34,387 --> 01:35:35,786
Why, Pa!

1111
01:35:51,067 --> 01:35:52,216
What will you do?

1112
01:35:52,467 --> 01:35:55,186
Hang him with the rest
from the nearest tree.

1113
01:35:59,507 --> 01:36:00,576
Just a minute!

1114
01:36:00,787 --> 01:36:04,177
Before we go, there's one thing
we've got to know.

1115
01:36:04,427 --> 01:36:05,780
Girls! Girls!

1116
01:36:06,267 --> 01:36:08,303
Reverend, what is it
you want to know?

1117
01:36:08,547 --> 01:36:10,617
We're all fathers here,
and we love you...

1118
01:36:10,867 --> 01:36:12,823
...so don't be afraid to answer.

1119
01:36:13,027 --> 01:36:16,178
I heard a wee babe crying
in the house. Whose is it?

1120
01:36:18,467 --> 01:36:20,105
Don't be afraid to tell.

1121
01:36:23,467 --> 01:36:24,661
Mine!

1122
01:36:29,227 --> 01:36:31,787
Do you, Alice, Ruth, Martha,
Liza, Sarah, Dorcas...

1123
01:36:32,027 --> 01:36:34,780
...take these men to be
your lawfully wedded husbands?

1124
01:36:39,547 --> 01:36:40,536
We do.

1125
01:36:40,747 --> 01:36:43,819
Do you, Benjamin, Caleb, Daniel,
Ephraim, Frankincense, Gideon...

1126
01:36:44,027 --> 01:36:46,780
...take these girls to be
your lawfully wedded wives?

1127
01:36:51,667 --> 01:36:52,782
We do.

1128
01:36:53,027 --> 01:36:55,587
I now pronounce you men and wives.
