1
00:03:09,222 --> 00:03:14,125
This is Nargis... the younger
sister of Nawab Chand.

2
00:03:16,829 --> 00:03:19,923
Her mesmerising voice...

3
00:03:20,300 --> 00:03:25,932
...and the tinkling of her dancing
bells are a sensation all over.

4
00:03:28,174 --> 00:03:34,477
There are scores of romantics who
yearn for her attention...

5
00:03:34,847 --> 00:03:37,941
and she doesn't bother
in the least.

6
00:03:40,186 --> 00:03:42,154
But yes...

7
00:03:43,022 --> 00:03:47,015
there is this man
whose arrival...

8
00:03:47,227 --> 00:03:52,665
...makes her gloomy in her
unholy surroundings.

9
00:03:53,633 --> 00:03:56,659
Her soul pleads with him...

10
00:03:56,903 --> 00:03:59,531
to take her away from there.

11
00:04:00,273 --> 00:04:07,236
The restless love in Shahab's eyes
convinces her that...

12
00:04:08,114 --> 00:04:15,213
I won't let you wither...

13
00:04:15,488 --> 00:04:17,422
in this infamous place.

14
00:04:18,725 --> 00:04:24,857
I'll come one night and
take you away from this hell.

15
00:04:52,358 --> 00:04:54,826
"Finally, the night arrived."

16
00:04:57,630 --> 00:05:00,861
The night of promise...

17
00:05:01,100 --> 00:05:03,660
...which Nargis had been...

18
00:05:05,104 --> 00:05:13,671
...restlessly looking forward to.

19
00:06:08,768 --> 00:06:09,735
Say something.

20
00:06:17,910 --> 00:06:19,741
I hope you're actually present.

21
00:06:21,381 --> 00:06:22,348
Yes.

22
00:06:24,250 --> 00:06:27,879
And I'm close to you?

23
00:06:30,156 --> 00:06:32,681
Yes. You're close to me.

24
00:06:39,332 --> 00:06:44,133
And you're taking me
to your house.

25
00:06:48,174 --> 00:06:52,474
Your house is built on
a very elevated level.

26
00:06:54,180 --> 00:06:55,477
Completely white...

27
00:06:57,517 --> 00:07:03,012
...and dressed as your bride
in a red ensemble...

28
00:07:04,590 --> 00:07:08,026
...I am alighting from a palanquin...

29
00:07:08,261 --> 00:07:09,751
in your courtyard.

30
00:07:25,478 --> 00:07:27,946
Uncle! Uncle!
- Stop!

31
00:07:38,157 --> 00:07:43,857
How dare you marry a prostitute
and bring her home?

32
00:07:44,263 --> 00:07:47,994
Father! You cannot use such
abusive words against her.

33
00:07:48,734 --> 00:07:51,794
She's my beloved and the
daughter-in-law of your family.

34
00:07:52,038 --> 00:07:56,873
Shut up! You cannot malign my
family with this society girl.

35
00:07:57,777 --> 00:08:00,143
She's not my daughter-in-law.
She's your wrongdoing!

36
00:08:01,781 --> 00:08:03,009
O Allah!

37
00:08:17,463 --> 00:08:18,657
Please stop!

38
00:08:22,101 --> 00:08:26,231
Where do you want to go?
- Take me to a graveyard.

39
00:09:11,450 --> 00:09:12,883
Poor Nargis!

40
00:09:14,620 --> 00:09:16,588
Having alighted from
the palanquin...

41
00:09:18,190 --> 00:09:24,789
...she is standing all alone
in this scary jungle of death.

42
00:09:27,466 --> 00:09:31,732
"There go all her
desires and dreams..."

43
00:09:31,938 --> 00:09:36,739
...leaving her helpless.

44
00:09:46,452 --> 00:09:54,951
Shahab searched for
his oppressed...

45
00:09:55,161 --> 00:09:57,721
bride in every...

46
00:09:57,930 --> 00:10:02,731
...nook and corner.

47
00:10:05,571 --> 00:10:14,309
Shahab's promises to Nargis are
now going against him...

48
00:10:14,513 --> 00:10:22,147
"...and consequently, he is
roaming around in vain."

49
00:10:58,691 --> 00:11:00,682
And here...

50
00:11:03,162 --> 00:11:14,005
"Nargis' sobbing life, having been
drenched in tears..."

51
00:11:14,173 --> 00:11:19,839
...is coming to an end in these...

52
00:11:20,046 --> 00:11:21,536
...deserted days and still nights.

53
00:11:26,052 --> 00:11:29,419
The gold coins are pure.
It must be some minor dirt.

54
00:11:44,236 --> 00:11:47,069
- Whose bangle is this?
- What's the matter?

55
00:11:47,606 --> 00:11:50,200
- It belongs to me.
- To you?

56
00:11:50,443 --> 00:11:52,877
Yes. It belongs to me.

57
00:11:53,379 --> 00:11:56,212
- But it belongs to somebody else!
- Whose is it?

58
00:11:59,685 --> 00:12:04,554
How should I describe her?
God knows who she is.

59
00:12:06,325 --> 00:12:09,123
She's living in our cemetry
since the past l0 months.

60
00:12:11,163 --> 00:12:17,363
She doesn't reveal where she has
come from and what's her misfortune.

61
00:12:17,903 --> 00:12:19,871
Only God knows what is ailing her.

62
00:12:20,840 --> 00:12:22,467
She doesn't even weep.

63
00:12:23,542 --> 00:12:26,136
She is just dying silently.

64
00:12:38,557 --> 00:12:42,493
Is that unfortunate
woman a blonde?

65
00:12:43,229 --> 00:12:45,595
Yes. She is a blonde.

66
00:12:47,233 --> 00:12:51,533
Take me to her. That unlucky
woman is my sister.

67
00:13:00,446 --> 00:13:01,674
Where is she?

68
00:13:32,678 --> 00:13:34,873
O sister!

69
00:13:37,716 --> 00:13:39,149
You're dead?

70
00:13:56,669 --> 00:14:00,901
I wonder how you must
have undergone...

71
00:14:01,106 --> 00:14:03,074
...such a severe punishment
because of your innocence.

72
00:14:05,344 --> 00:14:08,074
I wonder how you must
have tolerated...

73
00:14:08,280 --> 00:14:11,738
...this deserted place
of death.

74
00:14:15,120 --> 00:14:20,456
I wonder how much
you must've wept.

75
00:15:08,007 --> 00:15:09,872
These are some of
her belongings.

76
00:15:10,542 --> 00:15:12,066
You may sell it off.

77
00:15:30,429 --> 00:15:33,557
Sir!

78
00:15:35,567 --> 00:15:37,262
- What is it?
- I've found the book...

79
00:15:37,403 --> 00:15:38,995
...which you were
searching for.

80
00:15:39,171 --> 00:15:40,536
So you got it?

81
00:15:45,177 --> 00:15:46,644
Please show it to me.

82
00:15:51,917 --> 00:15:55,944
- Tell me... what should I pay?
- You may give whatever you like.

83
00:15:56,221 --> 00:15:58,155
"All right. Here, take it."

84
00:16:10,102 --> 00:16:13,071
Whose letter is this which
didn't reach its destination?

85
00:16:14,340 --> 00:16:16,240
Now you'll deliver it
to it's destination?

86
00:16:16,442 --> 00:16:19,309
Why not? It's a noble deed.

87
00:16:20,112 --> 00:16:21,340
I'll surely deliver it.

88
00:16:26,118 --> 00:16:30,418
I was not fortunate enough that...

89
00:16:30,656 --> 00:16:33,454
...I would've breathed my last
at your door-step.

90
00:16:34,493 --> 00:16:37,860
Neither was I fortunate that you'd
take my dead body to the graveyard.

91
00:16:39,565 --> 00:16:45,299
But I'd to leave your home and...

92
00:16:45,504 --> 00:16:47,734
...find a graveyard for myself.

93
00:16:49,942 --> 00:16:54,902
"Today, I'm leaving
your unjust world."

94
00:16:56,315 --> 00:16:58,408
You'll receive this
letter tomorrow.

95
00:16:59,518 --> 00:17:01,816
"The moment you read it,
come over here..."

96
00:17:02,087 --> 00:17:07,024
...and take away this innocent
child from my desolate lap.

97
00:17:08,427 --> 00:17:10,054
She is your child.

98
00:17:11,497 --> 00:17:15,194
Now we will meet on the doomsday.

99
00:17:16,869 --> 00:17:20,771
Goodbye...
Your sick... Nargis.

100
00:17:56,308 --> 00:17:57,935
She had a daughter too.

101
00:17:58,510 --> 00:18:01,673
Yes. But her sister
took her away.

102
00:18:02,381 --> 00:18:03,348
Her sister...?

103
00:19:00,472 --> 00:19:01,871
Get out of this whorehouse.

104
00:19:02,374 --> 00:19:04,274
You may wield your
influence elsewhere.

105
00:19:04,476 --> 00:19:07,001
Don't you know who I am?

106
00:19:07,446 --> 00:19:10,176
"If you ever step here again,
I'll order your limbs to be smashed."

107
00:19:17,222 --> 00:19:20,055
A Mr. Shahbuddin is
calling you downstairs.

108
00:19:39,111 --> 00:19:41,944
Who're you? I didn't
recognise you.

109
00:19:46,451 --> 00:19:48,942
I'm Shahbuddin.

110
00:19:49,288 --> 00:19:54,453
I see. So you're Shahbuddin?
My brother-in-law!

111
00:19:56,161 --> 00:19:58,561
Tell me... what brings you
here again?

112
00:20:00,065 --> 00:20:02,033
Which other culprit are you
searching for this time?

113
00:20:04,169 --> 00:20:09,801
Now which prostitute do you
intend to rescue from hell?

114
00:20:14,179 --> 00:20:16,545
Nargis wrote me a letter
when she was dying.

115
00:20:18,617 --> 00:20:20,585
I received the letter
seventeen years later.

116
00:20:22,621 --> 00:20:24,316
She has mentioned
about my daughter.

117
00:20:31,296 --> 00:20:34,857
I understand that she's here.

118
00:20:36,235 --> 00:20:39,727
- So you've come to see her?
- I've come to take her away.

119
00:20:40,239 --> 00:20:43,208
I see. So you've come
to take her away!

120
00:20:44,743 --> 00:20:48,201
Some graveyard must've made you
a request to bring her dead body.

121
00:20:49,348 --> 00:20:52,215
All right. Take her away.

122
00:20:52,684 --> 00:20:56,085
She's your daughter.
How can I refuse?

123
00:20:57,289 --> 00:20:59,587
But right now... she is busy
with her dance performance.

124
00:21:00,826 --> 00:21:06,992
"Moreover, it's against your pride
to take away your daughter..."

125
00:21:07,165 --> 00:21:09,133
...from this infamous locality.

126
00:21:10,636 --> 00:21:12,126
You may come back
tomorrow morning.

127
00:21:21,513 --> 00:21:22,537
Let's go.

128
00:25:48,179 --> 00:25:51,046
Muscleman... why is it locked?

129
00:25:52,517 --> 00:25:54,951
- They've gone away?
- When did they leave?

130
00:25:56,955 --> 00:26:00,015
They left at dawn.
- Do you know where they went?

131
00:26:00,425 --> 00:26:02,017
They've flown away from this perch.

132
00:26:02,260 --> 00:26:05,058
Who knows where they may
perch themselves?

133
00:26:06,831 --> 00:26:07,798
Let's go.

134
00:26:13,371 --> 00:26:14,599
Give me a paan.

135
00:26:15,106 --> 00:26:18,234
Since you chew paan
free-of-charge everyday...

136
00:26:18,443 --> 00:26:20,070
...you should twist your
moustache downwards.

137
00:27:57,175 --> 00:28:00,838
Disguising ourselves
as beggars...

138
00:28:01,046 --> 00:28:04,880
...we see the spectacle at
every step day after day.

139
00:29:14,052 --> 00:29:20,013
Forgive me... I happened to
come inside your compartment.

140
00:29:20,425 --> 00:29:23,656
I could see your feet.
They're very beautiful.

141
00:29:24,095 --> 00:29:27,587
Do not place them on the ground.
They will become dirty.

142
00:29:29,334 --> 00:29:30,801
Your fellow-traveller.

143
00:29:52,557 --> 00:29:56,323
I could see your feet.
They're very beautiful.

144
00:29:57,328 --> 00:30:01,128
Do not place them on the ground.
They will become dirty.

145
00:30:03,601 --> 00:30:05,000
Your fellow-traveller.

146
00:30:26,324 --> 00:30:28,656
I sent the word that
I'm not a wife...

147
00:30:28,860 --> 00:30:30,191
...that I'd weep in a
corner of the house.

148
00:30:30,395 --> 00:30:32,989
Why would I make my
heart suffer?

149
00:30:33,231 --> 00:30:35,426
"If one is interested,
a person may come here."

150
00:30:35,567 --> 00:30:38,001
"Otherwise, he may
stay with his wife."

151
00:30:38,236 --> 00:30:41,603
You've said it right.
- How wonderful!

152
00:30:42,173 --> 00:30:43,140
Greetings.

153
00:30:46,244 --> 00:30:47,802
Aunty has arrived.

154
00:30:48,813 --> 00:30:52,010
Mother! Aunty has arrived!

155
00:30:55,553 --> 00:30:57,214
- Greetings.
- God bless you.

156
00:31:06,030 --> 00:31:07,327
It would be great fun.

157
00:31:22,180 --> 00:31:24,011
- Greetings.
- Be happy!

158
00:31:27,352 --> 00:31:28,319
Come.

159
00:31:37,228 --> 00:31:38,593
I hope everything is fine.

160
00:31:41,232 --> 00:31:43,132
Can I have some
cold drinking water?

161
00:31:43,301 --> 00:31:44,598
We have cold water.

162
00:31:50,808 --> 00:31:52,366
Bring it over here.

163
00:31:54,512 --> 00:31:56,946
Dibban is not to be seen.
Where is she?

164
00:31:57,248 --> 00:31:58,715
She's sick.

165
00:32:02,120 --> 00:32:04,088
- Is Dibban sick?
- Yes.

166
00:32:29,914 --> 00:32:31,541
- When did you arrive?
- Just a while ago.

167
00:32:34,052 --> 00:32:35,019
I see...

168
00:32:36,187 --> 00:32:38,815
- Have you come alone?
- No.

169
00:32:39,223 --> 00:32:42,659
I've come with my aunt.
What's ailing you?

170
00:32:44,228 --> 00:32:49,996
You're so thoughtless.
I write so many letters...

171
00:32:50,234 --> 00:32:53,726
...and yet you send me a reply
several months later.

172
00:32:56,240 --> 00:33:00,074
Residents of Delhi aren't
believed to be hostile!

173
00:33:02,113 --> 00:33:04,240
How did you become one?

174
00:33:05,283 --> 00:33:08,411
You may scold me later. Rest
comfortably for the time being.

175
00:33:10,355 --> 00:33:13,415
But how come you've
arrived all of a sudden?

176
00:33:14,158 --> 00:33:15,819
No letter... no telegram?

177
00:33:16,995 --> 00:33:22,126
"I don't know. Day-before-yesterday,
somebody summoned aunty..."

178
00:33:22,300 --> 00:33:26,600
"...outside the brothel. When she
returned, she was worried."

179
00:33:26,871 --> 00:33:29,499
I cannot sit with her
in any brothel now.

180
00:33:30,708 --> 00:33:32,335
I'll be traced.

181
00:33:33,177 --> 00:33:37,841
"If I could find some mansion
separately, I would be relieved."

182
00:33:38,182 --> 00:33:40,810
What's so difficult about
finding a mansion?

183
00:33:41,252 --> 00:33:43,880
You could get the pink palace...

184
00:33:44,222 --> 00:33:47,521
...which Nawab Hashmat Shah
had given away to Gauhar Jaan.

185
00:33:49,227 --> 00:33:56,065
I don't have the capacity to be able
to buy the Nawab's pink palace.

186
00:33:56,601 --> 00:34:03,063
The Nawab has passed away now.
And Gauhar Jaan is neck-deep in debt.

187
00:34:04,108 --> 00:34:05,575
The palace is being auctioned now.

188
00:34:06,110 --> 00:34:08,078
The bid may reach upto one lakh
or one and a half lakh rupees.

189
00:34:09,113 --> 00:34:11,877
Don't you have that much money?

190
00:34:17,889 --> 00:34:18,821
That much!?

191
00:34:25,163 --> 00:34:26,460
The train is leaving.

192
00:34:54,992 --> 00:34:56,152
Do you need something?

193
00:35:11,275 --> 00:35:13,743
Take this. You have
the pink palace now.

194
00:35:29,494 --> 00:35:31,428
I've finalised everything.

195
00:35:31,963 --> 00:35:34,864
"From tomorrow, she'll live
in the palace along with him."

196
00:35:35,166 --> 00:35:37,396
And till the danger from
Shahabuddin blows over...

197
00:35:37,602 --> 00:35:40,127
...she'll be recognised as
Gauhar Jaan's niece.

198
00:36:05,163 --> 00:36:07,757
- Who is she?
- She's fire.

199
00:36:08,332 --> 00:36:11,665
Yes. The entire city is
burning with this fire.

200
00:36:12,203 --> 00:36:14,171
But this fire is yet
to affect me.

201
00:36:14,338 --> 00:36:17,068
It already has. You'll not be able
to keep it under control till night.

202
00:36:33,491 --> 00:36:35,425
It has been so wonderful!

203
00:36:49,173 --> 00:36:52,631
Welcome.
Please be seated here.

204
00:37:04,355 --> 00:37:09,452
He's the affluent Nawab Zafar
Ali Khan from Panipat.

205
00:37:12,096 --> 00:37:13,529
My greetings to you.

206
00:37:19,537 --> 00:37:22,563
Please see if it'll be
delayed further.

207
00:37:23,374 --> 00:37:24,341
All right.

208
00:39:00,771 --> 00:39:04,002
Why're you sitting there?

209
00:39:05,109 --> 00:39:06,736
Please sit here.

210
00:39:08,312 --> 00:39:11,008
I'm better off here.

211
00:46:23,647 --> 00:46:26,810
What must be the time now?
- It'll be three o'clock soon.

212
00:46:28,118 --> 00:46:29,608
You may go and sleep now.

213
00:48:07,050 --> 00:48:12,750
Forgive me... I happened to
come inside your compartment.

214
00:48:13,824 --> 00:48:17,419
I could see your feet.
They're very beautiful.

215
00:48:18,462 --> 00:48:22,364
Do not place them on the ground.
They will become dirty.

216
00:48:24,668 --> 00:48:26,067
Your fellow-traveller.

217
00:48:40,117 --> 00:48:42,085
Collect it with both arms.

218
00:48:43,120 --> 00:48:45,088
He's a very romantic
wealthy man.

219
00:48:46,156 --> 00:48:48,886
Whichever brothel
he climbs...

220
00:48:49,159 --> 00:48:51,093
...the stairs of such brothels
get to be made of gold.

221
00:48:57,401 --> 00:49:00,564
Folks! Now our queen
mother'll dance!

222
00:49:01,038 --> 00:49:03,506
- I'll dance?
- Bring the musical instruments.

223
00:49:09,246 --> 00:49:17,745
Come on. You should dance.
You dance so well.

224
00:49:17,955 --> 00:49:24,019
Where do I dance well now?
That was ages ago.

225
00:49:24,328 --> 00:49:30,961
"If the girls are insisting, why don't
you teach them a couple of steps?"

226
00:49:36,540 --> 00:49:38,872
Hurry up! Bring the instrument.

227
00:49:53,023 --> 00:49:54,752
Yes. I'll begin now.

228
00:50:31,995 --> 00:50:33,929
- Greetings.
- Bring it over.

229
00:50:35,565 --> 00:50:36,532
Keep it.

230
00:50:39,569 --> 00:50:42,003
What is this thing?
- Show them.

231
00:50:48,245 --> 00:50:56,482
"The Nawab has sent this carpet
worth 36,000 rupees..."

232
00:50:56,653 --> 00:50:58,621
...as a redressal for
last night's incident.

233
00:51:06,897 --> 00:51:10,128
A blacksmith's one blow is mightier
than a goldsmith's hundred blows.

234
00:51:13,870 --> 00:51:15,838
This is especially for
your amusement.

235
00:51:17,074 --> 00:51:21,033
I'd happened to tell Nawab that
she's very fond of birds.

236
00:51:21,244 --> 00:51:26,375
And pronto! He sent this for her.
It's priceless. It even sings.

237
00:51:26,516 --> 00:51:28,006
- Is it?
- Hear the bird sing.

238
00:51:32,222 --> 00:51:36,659
It's not a bird.
It's our dear sister.

239
00:51:37,694 --> 00:51:39,389
You shameless girl!
How can you embarrass her?

240
00:51:39,663 --> 00:51:42,188
Are you of her age?
- Senseless girl!

241
00:51:44,234 --> 00:51:46,725
"How can you behave like this?
After all, she's her elder sister."

242
00:51:52,242 --> 00:51:54,210
Take it and hang it there.

243
00:52:18,335 --> 00:52:20,132
I don't think I've to
go into details.

244
00:52:21,171 --> 00:52:24,368
"As it is, you're an
experienced person."

245
00:53:11,521 --> 00:53:13,045
Gosh! He has arrived.

246
00:53:15,525 --> 00:53:17,425
- Who has arrived?
- The Nawab.

247
00:53:30,540 --> 00:53:31,973
Please be seated.

248
00:53:45,522 --> 00:53:47,717
What's the matter?
Is there no gathering today?

249
00:53:48,525 --> 00:53:51,653
A gathering is scheduled.
But people didn't come.

250
00:53:52,529 --> 00:53:54,497
Perhaps because of
yesterday's incident.

251
00:53:55,532 --> 00:53:56,897
"Yes, perhaps."

252
00:53:57,200 --> 00:54:01,159
"But why do you worry? If people
didn't come, so be it."

253
00:54:01,871 --> 00:54:06,308
A moonlit night is far brighter
than a star-lit night.

254
00:54:06,476 --> 00:54:08,535
You've made a very
accurate observation.

255
00:54:08,812 --> 00:54:11,178
It's a fact.

256
00:54:12,849 --> 00:54:14,111
Go and call her.

257
00:54:15,518 --> 00:54:18,646
Bring along Shabnam too
to give you company.

258
00:54:29,466 --> 00:54:35,234
"I'd heard that affluent, wealthy
men are very meticulous in conduct."

259
00:54:36,473 --> 00:54:39,135
I hadn't seen it earlier.
I saw it yesterday.

260
00:54:41,478 --> 00:54:43,844
Thanks. I don't chew paan.

261
00:54:57,527 --> 00:54:59,154
I remembered that thing.

262
00:55:01,464 --> 00:55:03,159
That thing? Then let's go.

263
00:55:26,256 --> 00:55:27,553
My greetings to you.

264
00:55:28,792 --> 00:55:29,724
Greetings.

265
00:55:31,328 --> 00:55:32,693
I suppose you're well.

266
00:55:35,465 --> 00:55:36,830
Yes. By your grace.

267
00:55:41,471 --> 00:55:45,999
People do swear by you.
But did anybody...

268
00:55:46,142 --> 00:55:47,700
...remove the effect
of the evil eye?

269
00:55:50,880 --> 00:55:55,317
Ensure that it's removed. I might
caste an evil eye on you.

270
01:03:12,421 --> 01:03:14,286
- Did you get it made?
- Yes.

271
01:03:14,524 --> 01:03:15,889
Give it to me.

272
01:03:21,564 --> 01:03:24,431
Fool! Go and remove
it from inside.

273
01:03:25,701 --> 01:03:26,895
>From inside?

274
01:03:42,718 --> 01:03:43,912
I found it.

275
01:04:26,128 --> 01:04:29,291
I could see your feet.
They're very beautiful.

276
01:04:30,199 --> 01:04:33,600
Do not place them on the ground.
They will become dirty.

277
01:05:17,280 --> 01:05:19,714
O Lord! I'm also your slave.

278
01:05:28,457 --> 01:05:29,924
You're defeated now.

279
01:05:30,860 --> 01:05:32,088
Two and this is seven.

280
01:05:38,467 --> 01:05:40,435
- Where's she?
- She's in the bathroom.

281
01:05:40,903 --> 01:05:42,962
- And this...
- Come and play.

282
01:05:43,806 --> 01:05:46,297
You may play. I don't know
how to play this game.

283
01:05:47,910 --> 01:05:49,104
It's your move now.

284
01:05:55,518 --> 01:05:56,985
Who is it? Saheb Jaan?

285
01:05:57,520 --> 01:05:59,283
- When did you come?
- I just came.

286
01:05:59,922 --> 01:06:01,389
Is it Saaheb Jaan standing?

287
01:06:03,225 --> 01:06:05,090
Tell me... I hope you're fine.

288
01:06:06,462 --> 01:06:09,226
"Well, yes. Morning comes,
evening comes..."

289
01:06:09,465 --> 01:06:11,228
...life is just drifting away.

290
01:06:11,634 --> 01:06:14,228
You should come
over here sometimes.

291
01:06:14,804 --> 01:06:16,431
I'll come some day.

292
01:06:17,573 --> 01:06:20,269
Excuse me... I needed
something from you.

293
01:06:21,344 --> 01:06:22,641
What was it?

294
01:06:23,913 --> 01:06:25,642
I'm going to a dance
performance tomorrow.

295
01:06:25,848 --> 01:06:29,375
I'll need your head
ornament for a day.

296
01:06:30,319 --> 01:06:31,616
I'll return it
day-after-tomorrow.

297
01:06:32,121 --> 01:06:33,952
Of course! You may take it.

298
01:06:34,457 --> 01:06:36,288
"If you like, you may
not return it later."

299
01:06:45,134 --> 01:06:47,762
- Would you like to chew paan?
- No.

300
01:06:52,008 --> 01:06:53,976
Hey! These are the
same old ones.

301
01:06:54,477 --> 01:06:56,445
I thought the Nawab
must've gifted it to you.

302
01:06:59,482 --> 01:07:02,383
"If I'd asked for something else
now, I would've got it too."

303
01:07:05,454 --> 01:07:08,218
Really... I'djust been
remembering you.

304
01:07:20,870 --> 01:07:24,362
I hear you passed the whole
night inside the same blanket?

305
01:07:26,409 --> 01:07:30,175
And that the poor Nawab got
entangled in his own carpet?

306
01:07:31,414 --> 01:07:33,382
I'm tired of hearing the
same thing repeatedly.

307
01:07:37,286 --> 01:07:38,583
Are you tense about something?

308
01:07:39,655 --> 01:07:41,589
Yes. It's something like it.

309
01:07:42,458 --> 01:07:43,823
What is it?

310
01:07:45,461 --> 01:07:47,088
Just pull the curtains.

311
01:08:13,456 --> 01:08:16,391
Yes... what's the matter?

312
01:08:19,395 --> 01:08:24,128
"Since several days, I get the
feeling that I'm changing."

313
01:08:25,201 --> 01:08:29,638
As if I'm undergoing
an unknown journey...

314
01:08:29,839 --> 01:08:31,363
...and that I'm going somewhere.

315
01:08:32,408 --> 01:08:34,376
I'm leaving everything.

316
01:08:35,911 --> 01:08:39,039
Saheb Jaan is slipping away...

317
01:08:39,415 --> 01:08:41,906
...and I'm being distanced
from Saheb Jaan.

318
01:08:44,453 --> 01:08:46,387
- Who is it?
- Who?

319
01:08:47,323 --> 01:08:48,620
The one whom I'm asking?

320
01:08:50,793 --> 01:08:51,725
Tell me!

321
01:08:53,796 --> 01:08:57,664
How should I say who it is?
It's a peculiar incident.

322
01:08:58,634 --> 01:08:59,931
What is it?

323
01:09:01,403 --> 01:09:06,170
"Every night, at 3 o'clock..."

324
01:09:06,408 --> 01:09:11,368
...a train derails from the tracks
and passes through my heart.

325
01:09:12,982 --> 01:09:14,779
And it gives me a message.

326
01:09:16,452 --> 01:09:17,749
What message?

327
01:10:09,471 --> 01:10:11,871
This message is not meant for you.

328
01:10:13,242 --> 01:10:16,700
What?
No. It is meant for me.

329
01:10:18,414 --> 01:10:20,974
I found it kept near my feet.

330
01:10:21,584 --> 01:10:25,884
You're right. But you must not
be wearing the bells at that time.

331
01:10:27,923 --> 01:10:30,153
If you had been
wearing the bells...

332
01:10:30,326 --> 01:10:34,854
...how would anyone have asked you
not to keep your feet on the ground?

333
01:10:36,732 --> 01:10:37,960
My dear one...

334
01:10:39,802 --> 01:10:44,603
It is indeed a message.
But it is misdirected.

335
01:11:02,858 --> 01:11:05,418
"And tonight, he is celebrating."

336
01:11:06,662 --> 01:11:09,426
I'll come in the evening
and take her away.

337
01:11:11,533 --> 01:11:12,693
All right.

338
01:11:19,408 --> 01:11:23,367
- Where from are you returning?
- I'd been to meet Dibban.

339
01:11:24,413 --> 01:11:27,041
Come over here. Look what all
he has brought with him.

340
01:11:27,416 --> 01:11:28,644
I'm coming.

341
01:11:37,126 --> 01:11:38,286
Gosh!

342
01:11:41,463 --> 01:11:43,090
I'm very tired.

343
01:11:45,734 --> 01:11:48,862
Go tell her that I'm very tired.

344
01:11:49,638 --> 01:11:50,605
All right.

345
01:11:56,912 --> 01:11:59,039
This message is not meant for you.

346
01:12:45,594 --> 01:12:46,822
Be seated.

347
01:12:49,531 --> 01:12:50,828
Be comfortable.

348
01:13:03,645 --> 01:13:04,942
What's the matter?

349
01:13:06,815 --> 01:13:07,782
What?

350
01:13:08,016 --> 01:13:10,246
Why do you seem to appear as if...

351
01:13:10,586 --> 01:13:13,953
"...you're not Saheb Jaan,
but somebody else?"

352
01:13:16,525 --> 01:13:19,221
But you've bought me as Saheb Jaan.

353
01:13:20,696 --> 01:13:26,157
Yes. I did buy you.
But I've suffered a loss.

354
01:13:29,271 --> 01:13:34,106
My heart seems to say as if
you're a stolen property.

355
01:13:35,244 --> 01:13:36,768
As if it would be
a crime to buy you.

356
01:13:44,520 --> 01:13:45,885
Why're you looking there?

357
01:13:48,524 --> 01:13:50,458
- I've a request.
- What is that?

358
01:13:51,326 --> 01:13:53,760
- Change the topic.
- All right.

359
01:13:55,531 --> 01:13:56,896
But look towards me.

360
01:14:06,475 --> 01:14:10,707
Do you remember that poem?
- Which one?

361
01:14:11,580 --> 01:14:15,209
Hearing which travellers
forget their route.

362
01:14:18,454 --> 01:14:22,982
I'd happened to meet
somebody enroute.

363
01:14:25,227 --> 01:14:26,194
I remember.

364
01:15:07,202 --> 01:15:08,430
What happened?

365
01:15:10,472 --> 01:15:13,441
What's this?
- Elephants have come.

366
01:15:14,009 --> 01:15:16,204
- What is it?
- Elephants!

367
01:18:23,999 --> 01:18:29,062
"It's a stormy night,
and I'm travelling."

368
01:18:30,005 --> 01:18:32,838
There's nobody in the
compartment besides me.

369
01:18:33,942 --> 01:18:36,911
But on the opposite berth...

370
01:18:37,045 --> 01:18:39,707
...my enchanting memory is
turning over once again.

371
01:18:40,682 --> 01:18:45,210
And the beautiful feet
decorated with henna...

372
01:18:45,454 --> 01:18:47,888
...continue to make me
restless even today.

373
01:18:48,557 --> 01:18:52,618
What is it? What's the
name of this condition?

374
01:18:58,967 --> 01:18:59,934
Love.

375
01:24:39,040 --> 01:24:40,007
O Lord!

376
01:24:41,643 --> 01:24:43,440
He's standing close to me.

377
01:24:45,380 --> 01:24:47,211
And I'm feeling suffocated.

378
01:24:54,522 --> 01:24:59,289
You'll continue to stare
at me in amazement...

379
01:24:59,527 --> 01:25:02,928
...and I'll die without

380
01:25:04,265 --> 01:25:07,826
...even glancing at you once.

381
01:25:09,637 --> 01:25:14,973
"I'll die on your bed,
in front of your eyes."

382
01:25:17,145 --> 01:25:23,084
Turn your face.
Give me some respite...

383
01:25:23,451 --> 01:25:26,579
...so that I can heave
a sigh of relief...

384
01:25:26,955 --> 01:25:28,889
...and glance at you once.

385
01:25:53,381 --> 01:25:54,939
It's such a strange incident.

386
01:25:56,684 --> 01:25:58,618
As if somebody would be
narrating a story.

387
01:26:12,800 --> 01:26:14,028
Greetings.

388
01:26:14,736 --> 01:26:16,966
Not there... this way.

389
01:26:36,457 --> 01:26:40,291
I'm stunned upon
finding you here.

390
01:26:44,632 --> 01:26:48,932
"In this jungle, on this
distant island..."

391
01:26:49,938 --> 01:26:54,773
...who has left you in
the solitude of my tent?

392
01:26:58,479 --> 01:26:59,844
Say something.

393
01:27:00,682 --> 01:27:01,979
Who're you?

394
01:27:13,027 --> 01:27:14,426
What is your name?

395
01:27:16,197 --> 01:27:19,166
Name... my name!

396
01:27:21,069 --> 01:27:22,536
You didn't reply.

397
01:27:27,575 --> 01:27:34,981
Who am I? And how I've come here?
I don't remember anything.

398
01:27:44,459 --> 01:27:48,225
This night will
make me go crazy.

399
01:28:06,748 --> 01:28:08,375
May I try to remind you something?

400
01:28:10,451 --> 01:28:14,387
Perhaps you might remember something
from your lost memories.

401
01:28:20,795 --> 01:28:22,763
It was a rainy night.

402
01:28:24,565 --> 01:28:26,533
You were travelling in a train.

403
01:28:29,404 --> 01:28:32,237
I happened to come inside
your compartment.

404
01:28:33,741 --> 01:28:35,368
You were sleeping.

405
01:28:36,611 --> 01:28:41,913
"You continued to sleep,
but your feet awakened..."

406
01:28:42,116 --> 01:28:44,380
...and they wreaked
havoc on my senses.

407
01:28:46,054 --> 01:28:52,323
You must've received my note near
your feet in which...

408
01:28:52,460 --> 01:28:54,428
...I mentioned about your feet.

409
01:28:55,730 --> 01:29:00,167
You must've read it.
Try to remember.

410
01:29:03,271 --> 01:29:06,900
I could see your feet.
They're very beautiful.

411
01:29:07,809 --> 01:29:11,643
Do not place them on the ground.
They will become dirty.

412
01:29:16,951 --> 01:29:18,885
This message is not meant for you.

413
01:29:20,388 --> 01:29:21,320
What?

414
01:29:22,256 --> 01:29:24,190
No. It is meant for me.

415
01:29:25,560 --> 01:29:28,154
I found it kept near my feet.

416
01:29:29,130 --> 01:29:33,157
You're right. But you must not
be wearing the bells at that time.

417
01:29:37,405 --> 01:29:38,770
Did you remember anything?

418
01:29:56,891 --> 01:29:58,381
Excuse me...

419
01:30:05,466 --> 01:30:06,433
Yes?

420
01:30:07,468 --> 01:30:09,993
I'm going away from you
for some time.

421
01:30:10,271 --> 01:30:11,238
Where?

422
01:30:12,473 --> 01:30:15,704
Not very far. Just across that river.

423
01:30:17,145 --> 01:30:20,706
"But after reaching there,
I'll send my messenger to you."

424
01:30:21,516 --> 01:30:23,882
He'll care for you
till I return.

425
01:30:25,553 --> 01:30:29,421
By when will you return?
- I'll return before dusk.

426
01:30:31,259 --> 01:30:33,318
Make sure that you return
before nightfall.

427
01:30:35,363 --> 01:30:36,762
I'll surely return.

428
01:30:49,477 --> 01:30:50,444
Excuse me.

429
01:30:58,319 --> 01:30:59,786
You were about to say something?

430
01:31:04,459 --> 01:31:06,427
Do return before nightfall.

431
01:31:07,462 --> 01:31:08,759
I will.

432
01:31:55,476 --> 01:31:56,443
"Yes, Sir."

433
01:32:02,517 --> 01:32:03,711
I'm coming.

434
01:32:08,723 --> 01:32:14,593
Go over to my tent immediately.
My guest is staying there.

435
01:32:14,795 --> 01:32:16,763
Take along food-stuff with you.

436
01:32:18,633 --> 01:32:22,569
"Till I don't return,
you remain there."

437
01:32:22,737 --> 01:32:23,931
All right.

438
01:32:40,288 --> 01:32:41,983
Look! Is she the one?

439
01:32:46,961 --> 01:32:48,690
Yes. She's the one.

440
01:33:07,481 --> 01:33:08,846
Thank God!

441
01:33:27,468 --> 01:33:28,435
Sir!

442
01:33:36,243 --> 01:33:39,440
Here I come.
The sun hasn't set yet.

443
01:33:41,582 --> 01:33:42,947
There's nobody here.

444
01:33:44,518 --> 01:33:45,780
There's nobody here?

445
01:33:59,667 --> 01:34:01,567
Greetings.

446
01:34:12,380 --> 01:34:13,347
Yes...!?

447
01:34:36,203 --> 01:34:37,431
You may begin.

448
01:34:41,375 --> 01:34:44,674
You were about to say something?

449
01:34:46,480 --> 01:34:48,448
Do return before nightfall.

450
01:34:49,650 --> 01:34:50,912
I will.

451
01:34:56,057 --> 01:34:57,490
How wonderful!

452
01:34:59,527 --> 01:35:01,757
It's a wonderful beginning.

453
01:35:04,065 --> 01:35:06,158
We poor things have had it today.

454
01:35:06,467 --> 01:35:09,698
You may say that doomsday
will be coming soon.

455
01:35:09,970 --> 01:35:14,930
You're right. But ask Saheb Jaan
when the doomsday will arrive.

456
01:35:57,785 --> 01:35:59,047
Did you see?

457
01:35:59,520 --> 01:36:02,250
Didn't I tell you not to
hold a dance performance...

458
01:36:02,456 --> 01:36:04,390
...till her fever
subsides completely?

459
01:36:06,460 --> 01:36:08,018
Her body is still warm.

460
01:36:09,597 --> 01:36:11,087
How can she dance?

461
01:36:12,533 --> 01:36:14,831
You gentlemen have been
unnecessarily inconvenienced.

462
01:36:15,603 --> 01:36:16,968
I'm leaving.

463
01:36:18,739 --> 01:36:22,175
Her helplessness is a such
a defence that...

464
01:36:22,610 --> 01:36:24,578
...though she made
go away a hundred times...

465
01:36:24,812 --> 01:36:26,575
...yet I returned
as many times.

466
01:36:50,501 --> 01:36:53,701
Here! Take this.

467
01:36:54,201 --> 01:36:56,401
You may ward off the evil eye
from Saheb Jaan on my behalf.

468
01:38:17,501 --> 01:38:18,801
Who is it?

469
01:38:25,501 --> 01:38:28,101
Hey! Didn't you recognise me?

470
01:38:28,901 --> 01:38:30,301
I'm the contractor.

471
01:38:36,601 --> 01:38:37,901
Listen to me.

472
01:38:39,401 --> 01:38:40,901
I've been summoned.

473
01:38:42,501 --> 01:38:44,001
Why're you so worried?

474
01:38:45,401 --> 01:38:46,801
How strange!

475
01:41:48,201 --> 01:41:49,201
What happened?

476
01:41:49,401 --> 01:41:51,301
Perhaps somebody has been
run over by the train.

477
01:42:02,401 --> 01:42:04,001
It's an accident.

478
01:42:06,401 --> 01:42:09,201
"Really, when God protects,
nobody can kill a person."

479
01:42:09,401 --> 01:42:12,201
- Take the train behind.
- It's God's miracle!

480
01:42:12,401 --> 01:42:15,401
You're right. But the engine driver
too has stopped the train rightly.

481
01:42:30,601 --> 01:42:32,201
Where were you lost?

482
01:42:38,601 --> 01:42:40,701
I wonder where I roam around.

483
01:42:42,401 --> 01:42:43,901
I don't remember anything.

484
01:42:45,501 --> 01:42:49,101
You happen to meet me automatically...

485
01:42:49,501 --> 01:42:51,401
...and sometimes you
get distanced again.

486
01:42:53,501 --> 01:42:57,901
"I wonder if it's my dream,
or have I gone mad?"

487
01:43:00,401 --> 01:43:06,701
I don't know when this
dream would be shattered...

488
01:43:07,001 --> 01:43:09,901
...and which desolate place
would I end up in?

489
01:43:11,901 --> 01:43:13,901
I wonder where I'll
regain consciousness.

490
01:43:15,701 --> 01:43:19,201
Wherever you'll regain
consciousness...

491
01:43:19,401 --> 01:43:21,501
...my eyes will be
watching you.

492
01:43:23,301 --> 01:43:28,101
And the key to your dreams
will be found in my eyes.

493
01:43:29,601 --> 01:43:30,601
Yes.

494
01:43:38,601 --> 01:43:41,501
Stop crying. Or you'll get
a severe beating from me.

495
01:43:55,501 --> 01:43:56,901
"Greetings, grandmother."

496
01:43:57,601 --> 01:44:00,001
"Greetings, Mother.
Greetings to everyone."

497
01:44:00,201 --> 01:44:01,401
May you live long.

498
01:44:03,401 --> 01:44:04,901
Please come and be seated.

499
01:44:16,501 --> 01:44:18,401
Everybody is so surprised.

500
01:44:19,901 --> 01:44:20,801
Yes.

501
01:44:23,601 --> 01:44:25,401
We're indeed surprised.

502
01:44:26,401 --> 01:44:28,401
About who this person
accompanying me is?

503
01:44:29,801 --> 01:44:31,501
Yes. Who is she?

504
01:44:32,501 --> 01:44:35,901
I too don't know
who she is.

505
01:44:37,201 --> 01:44:42,701
She's an oppressed girl
who has lost her memory.

506
01:44:44,201 --> 01:44:45,401
Come over here.

507
01:44:59,001 --> 01:45:02,401
She appears to belong
to a decent family.

508
01:45:04,901 --> 01:45:06,901
That's why I've brought her here.

509
01:45:08,601 --> 01:45:13,201
"And till she remembers her identity,
she will stay here."

510
01:45:13,401 --> 01:45:14,801
"Of course, why not?"

511
01:45:15,401 --> 01:45:18,901
- How're you?
- Come on. Take breakfast now.

512
01:45:19,101 --> 01:45:20,501
I'll take breakfast.
Let me refresh myself.

513
01:45:20,801 --> 01:45:22,801
Come on. Help me wash myself.

514
01:45:32,401 --> 01:45:35,601
When are you offering bracelets
to your sweeper woman?

515
01:45:37,501 --> 01:45:40,301
Get married first. Then I'll
offer you several bracelets.

516
01:45:41,401 --> 01:45:45,501
I've already got married. How could
I've waited for you to marry?

517
01:45:46,201 --> 01:45:49,901
You've already selected the girl.
You should get married now.

518
01:45:50,401 --> 01:45:51,701
"Stop, will you?"

519
01:45:59,601 --> 01:46:01,401
Where's grandfather?

520
01:46:02,301 --> 01:46:04,401
He's gone to Hyderabad
to fetch your Uncle?

521
01:46:05,501 --> 01:46:07,701
- Hyderabad?
- Yes.

522
01:46:08,401 --> 01:46:11,401
He's lying sick in the
government hospital.

523
01:46:11,801 --> 01:46:15,201
Why do you've to weep?
He's going to return home.

524
01:46:15,401 --> 01:46:17,801
There should be celebrations
to mark his return.

525
01:46:19,101 --> 01:46:22,901
"Don't weep now. After all, grandpa
will be fetching him back."

526
01:46:32,801 --> 01:46:35,201
- Open the door.
- Who is it?

527
01:46:35,601 --> 01:46:36,901
It's us.

528
01:47:02,701 --> 01:47:03,801
"Greetings, Mother."

529
01:47:05,501 --> 01:47:07,801
My son!

530
01:47:11,301 --> 01:47:13,201
Uncle has arrived!

531
01:47:16,801 --> 01:47:18,601
- Greetings.
- God bless you.

532
01:47:29,501 --> 01:47:33,301
"- Greetings, Uncle.
- God bless you."

533
01:47:36,201 --> 01:47:37,601
She has grown up very fast.

534
01:47:39,401 --> 01:47:40,901
Arrange the food.

535
01:47:43,601 --> 01:47:46,101
"- Greetings, Uncle.
- Oh! So you're here too!"

536
01:47:46,301 --> 01:47:48,201
"When I arrived here, I was told
that you were in Hyderabad."

537
01:47:48,401 --> 01:47:50,201
- Be happy.
- I hope you're fine now.

538
01:47:54,401 --> 01:47:55,801
Who is she?

539
01:48:04,401 --> 01:48:07,301
- Greet him.
- May you live long.

540
01:48:09,501 --> 01:48:13,401
Is she your bride?
- No. She's Arif's bride.

541
01:48:14,101 --> 01:48:16,801
I see. So Arif got married!

542
01:48:17,301 --> 01:48:20,901
We had to marry him.
We searched for you a lot.

543
01:48:21,501 --> 01:48:23,101
But we didn't find you anywhere.

544
01:48:25,201 --> 01:48:27,301
It's nice that he married.
My congratulations.

545
01:48:29,301 --> 01:48:32,101
- You've married too?
- How can he marry?

546
01:48:32,401 --> 01:48:35,501
"Till he doesn't choose a girl
himself, he wouldn't marry."

547
01:48:35,901 --> 01:48:39,901
Then select a girl. I'm very
keen to see you married.

548
01:48:40,401 --> 01:48:42,701
"Moreover, I'm not sure
how long I'll live now."

549
01:48:42,901 --> 01:48:45,801
Why do you say that? You'll live
for many more years now.

550
01:48:46,001 --> 01:48:48,501
It would be better if
you select some girl.

551
01:48:48,801 --> 01:48:51,901
- He has already selected a girl.
- Is it?

552
01:48:52,101 --> 01:48:53,601
- She's sitting there.
- Be seated.

553
01:49:01,301 --> 01:49:02,301
Who is it?

554
01:49:18,301 --> 01:49:20,101
"- Greetings, grandpa.
- When did you come?"

555
01:49:20,301 --> 01:49:22,101
- I too arrived today.
- Be seated.

556
01:49:26,301 --> 01:49:27,701
Who's that girl?

557
01:49:44,201 --> 01:49:45,601
She is with me.

558
01:49:50,101 --> 01:49:53,401
"Girls, you may go."

559
01:50:08,801 --> 01:50:11,301
Yes.
- Who is she?

560
01:50:12,701 --> 01:50:17,301
She's an unknown girl.
- She's with you?

561
01:50:18,301 --> 01:50:20,101
- Yes.
- What do you mean?

562
01:50:23,601 --> 01:50:27,001
Even I don't know who she is.

563
01:50:28,401 --> 01:50:33,901
She's an oppressed girl
who has lost her memory.

564
01:50:34,601 --> 01:50:38,101
"Incidentally, she has
come into my refuge."

565
01:50:41,001 --> 01:50:46,601
But who will believe
what you're saying?

566
01:50:47,601 --> 01:50:49,001
I don't care.

567
01:50:52,901 --> 01:50:56,401
You may not be worried.
But I'm worried about you.

568
01:50:58,501 --> 01:51:02,201
Those who get burnt with milk...

569
01:51:02,401 --> 01:51:05,001
...they even drink
curd-milk with caution.

570
01:51:07,501 --> 01:51:10,001
It's a pity that people
get burnt with milk too.

571
01:51:12,401 --> 01:51:14,401
Do you want to enter into
an argument with me?

572
01:51:18,401 --> 01:51:20,701
You need not argue with me.

573
01:51:22,501 --> 01:51:28,301
A girl who doesn't have a
name or an address...

574
01:51:28,701 --> 01:51:30,301
...why is she in your company?

575
01:51:34,701 --> 01:51:37,401
It's because she is
under my care.

576
01:51:38,801 --> 01:51:40,401
And it's not a crime.

577
01:51:41,301 --> 01:51:44,801
It's not a crime. But it will
bring me disrepute.

578
01:51:45,401 --> 01:51:47,601
No. You cannot lose any reputation.

579
01:51:48,001 --> 01:51:50,501
"If anybody will lose his
reputation, it will be me."

580
01:51:51,201 --> 01:51:55,601
Who're you? Don't I have
any relationship with you?

581
01:51:56,401 --> 01:52:00,901
You've a relationship. But you've no
connection with this matter of mine.

582
01:52:02,701 --> 01:52:04,301
I've no connection?

583
01:52:04,701 --> 01:52:10,101
"If I don't have any connection,
why've you brought her to my home?"

584
01:52:11,401 --> 01:52:13,601
"Undoubtedly, I've made a mistake."

585
01:52:17,401 --> 01:52:22,401
I'd forgotten that people in this
family have to...

586
01:52:22,601 --> 01:52:27,501
...seek permission from you even
before taking every breath.

587
01:52:28,501 --> 01:52:32,201
And your progeny doesn't walk on
the ground which is created by God.

588
01:52:32,601 --> 01:52:34,601
"Rather, your progeny
crawls on your palm."

589
01:52:45,501 --> 01:52:46,801
Let's go away from here.

590
01:52:47,601 --> 01:52:52,001
This mansion is built
with quicksand...

591
01:52:52,201 --> 01:52:54,001
...and it cannot provide
shelter to anybody.

592
01:52:54,801 --> 01:52:56,201
It's a very dangerous place.

593
01:53:07,401 --> 01:53:08,401
Wait!

594
01:53:29,501 --> 01:53:32,101
Perhaps you've forgotten
about yourself for ever.

595
01:53:34,101 --> 01:53:39,101
I'm convinced now that you're
nothing but my destiny.

596
01:53:41,601 --> 01:53:43,001
Look over there.

597
01:53:43,601 --> 01:53:45,901
The entire world is
bowing at your feet.

598
01:53:47,201 --> 01:53:49,701
And they're all saluting you.

599
01:53:50,601 --> 01:53:53,001
O Lord! Please remain quiet.

600
01:53:54,101 --> 01:53:56,901
Don't kill me so lovingly.

601
01:53:58,401 --> 01:54:04,501
I confess that
I remember who I am.

602
01:54:05,701 --> 01:54:07,001
Who are you?

603
01:54:09,601 --> 01:54:12,801
Who are you?
- I'm an innocent woman.

604
01:54:13,501 --> 01:54:15,501
That's what you'd told me.

605
01:54:16,901 --> 01:54:21,301
"You came, you wrote a note..."

606
01:54:21,601 --> 01:54:25,101
...and then you never let me
sleep peacefully thereafter.

607
01:54:26,601 --> 01:54:31,101
"Every night, you have been calling
out and passing through."

608
01:54:32,201 --> 01:54:36,501
"Every single day, you've been
pulling away my soul from my body."

609
01:54:38,601 --> 01:54:43,501
I would have died
aspiring for you.

610
01:54:44,801 --> 01:54:47,801
But you never let me die too.

611
01:54:49,601 --> 01:54:51,201
I would've run away.

612
01:54:52,601 --> 01:54:55,101
But your tent surrounded me.

613
01:54:56,601 --> 01:55:03,001
"You came, and your heartbeats
didn't even let me say..."

614
01:55:03,201 --> 01:55:05,001
...that I'm a prostitute.

615
01:59:04,501 --> 01:59:06,001
Please stop the carriage.

616
01:59:21,501 --> 01:59:23,401
- Make one garland.
- A garland?

617
01:59:23,701 --> 01:59:25,401
All right. Please be seated.

618
01:59:27,401 --> 01:59:28,701
Make an attractive one.

619
02:00:03,001 --> 02:00:05,501
You mean you're not
recognising me?

620
02:00:10,601 --> 02:00:12,101
How wonderful!

621
02:00:12,901 --> 02:00:16,701
But why so much displeasure that
you're not even greeting me?

622
02:00:17,201 --> 02:00:18,501
Who are you?

623
02:00:20,701 --> 02:00:23,801
I see... so she's with you!

624
02:00:25,501 --> 02:00:26,801
Come here.

625
02:00:36,201 --> 02:00:37,901
"- Yes, Sir.
- Who're you?"

626
02:00:38,601 --> 02:00:41,501
- Tell him my name.
- He's Hashim Khan.

627
02:00:46,301 --> 02:00:47,601
"No, Sir."

628
02:00:51,601 --> 02:00:53,701
Now you'll have to reveal
your name too.

629
02:00:54,701 --> 02:00:58,201
I'm a stranger here.
And I'm a decent person.

630
02:01:03,301 --> 02:01:05,001
Come on. Proceed.

631
02:01:12,301 --> 02:01:13,501
Who's he?

632
02:01:15,501 --> 02:01:17,501
How many people's name
will you ask me?

633
02:01:47,301 --> 02:01:51,201
What's your intention?
- I want to ask you your name.

634
02:01:51,601 --> 02:01:53,201
Please stop the carriage.

635
02:01:55,501 --> 02:01:57,201
Let me introduce myself to him.

636
02:02:02,501 --> 02:02:04,501
You were asking me my name?
Get down.

637
02:02:04,701 --> 02:02:07,201
Leave the reins.
Leave the reins.

638
02:03:02,001 --> 02:03:05,301
- Who's he?
- He's some ruffian.

639
02:03:12,701 --> 02:03:16,201
She's some whore.

640
02:03:29,301 --> 02:03:30,701
She's a heady stuff.

641
02:03:43,801 --> 02:03:45,101
What's your name?

642
02:03:47,601 --> 02:03:49,001
What's your profession?

643
02:03:53,401 --> 02:03:55,201
I asked you your profession.

644
02:03:56,001 --> 02:03:57,801
Is it important
to tell you that?

645
02:03:58,101 --> 02:04:00,901
"- Yes, it is.
- I'm a forest officer."

646
02:04:03,601 --> 02:04:05,101
Constable... you may go.

647
02:04:10,601 --> 02:04:15,301
It doesn't befit an officer
of your rank...

648
02:04:15,501 --> 02:04:17,501
...to have had to come
to a police station.

649
02:04:19,301 --> 02:04:20,901
It's a matter of regret.

650
02:04:23,601 --> 02:04:25,901
"Anyway, you may go."

651
02:04:34,501 --> 02:04:35,901
Bring in Mr. Hashim Khan.

652
02:04:40,601 --> 02:04:47,201
"Wherever you take me, my notoriety
will follow close behind."

653
02:04:48,501 --> 02:04:53,001
This sky is my enemy.
It'll never come to an end.

654
02:04:54,601 --> 02:04:56,601
Where are you taking me
so that you may hide me?

655
02:04:58,301 --> 02:05:01,701
To the place where
your sky ends.

656
02:05:05,101 --> 02:05:07,201
- Greetings.
- Greetings.

657
02:05:08,001 --> 02:05:10,401
- What can I do for you?
- I've come to marry her.

658
02:05:11,101 --> 02:05:12,001
All right.

659
02:05:12,801 --> 02:05:16,301
"Gentlemen, please attend
this marriage."

660
02:05:29,601 --> 02:05:36,501
And what's your name?
- She's some whore.

661
02:05:39,001 --> 02:05:41,301
Her name is Pakeezah.

662
02:05:49,601 --> 02:05:55,201
Do you approve of your...

663
02:05:55,501 --> 02:05:59,701
...marriage to Salim Ahmed Khan?

664
02:06:05,001 --> 02:06:10,101
Do you approve of your...

665
02:06:10,301 --> 02:06:14,601
...marriage to Salim Ahmed Khan?

666
02:06:19,501 --> 02:06:22,201
- Say yes.
- You may remain quiet.

667
02:06:22,501 --> 02:06:24,201
Let me ask her.

668
02:06:24,601 --> 02:06:29,401
I'm questioning you
for the final time.

669
02:06:29,701 --> 02:06:32,801
Don't feel shy.
Say yes or no.

670
02:06:33,101 --> 02:06:38,701
Do you approve of your...

671
02:06:39,001 --> 02:06:43,301
...marriage to Salim Ahmed Khan?

672
02:06:43,601 --> 02:06:45,501
No! No!

673
02:08:03,901 --> 02:08:07,401
"Has Saheb Jaan returned?
- Yes, she has returned."

674
02:08:49,001 --> 02:08:53,701
Yes. My vagabond dead body...

675
02:08:53,901 --> 02:08:59,901
...has returned to be buried
in this colourful tomb.

676
02:09:00,101 --> 02:09:02,501
Hush! What dead body?

677
02:09:03,901 --> 02:09:07,201
Yes. Every whore
is a dead body.

678
02:09:07,701 --> 02:09:10,801
I'm a dead body. And you too!

679
02:09:15,601 --> 02:09:21,301
This marketplace
is a graveyard...

680
02:09:21,501 --> 02:09:27,001
...of women whose
souls are dead...

681
02:09:27,201 --> 02:09:30,501
...but the bodies
remain alive.

682
02:09:32,301 --> 02:09:39,701
These mansions are
our tombs...

683
02:09:39,901 --> 02:09:45,301
...in which the living coffins
of we dead women...

684
02:09:45,501 --> 02:09:47,501
...are kept after
being decorated.

685
02:09:49,301 --> 02:09:55,901
Our coffins are left open...

686
02:09:56,201 --> 02:09:57,101
...so that...

687
02:09:57,301 --> 02:09:59,201
Keep quiet. Keep quiet.

688
02:10:00,601 --> 02:10:09,301
I'm a restless dead body
of one such open coffin...

689
02:10:09,601 --> 02:10:16,101
...which is lured by life
again and again.

690
02:10:34,601 --> 02:10:41,501
But now I've got fed up
of my waywardness...

691
02:10:41,801 --> 02:10:46,601
...and this treachery
on the part of life.

692
02:10:48,101 --> 02:10:49,601
I've got tired of it.

693
02:10:55,501 --> 02:10:58,601
What has happened?
Did he reject you?

694
02:10:59,301 --> 02:11:03,201
No. I left him.

695
02:11:05,301 --> 02:11:09,501
I afflicted him with
a serious wound...

696
02:11:09,701 --> 02:11:12,801
...and made my exit
from his heavenly heart.

697
02:11:13,201 --> 02:11:14,301
Why?

698
02:11:17,601 --> 02:11:20,201
I got scared.

699
02:11:22,101 --> 02:11:26,701
The ground of that world
was such that...

700
02:11:26,901 --> 02:11:33,201
"...wherever I set foot, the ground
used to sink at the same spots."

701
02:11:40,601 --> 02:11:45,901
Look over there...
that kite is so much like me.

702
02:11:48,501 --> 02:11:50,501
"It's cut away, like I am."

703
02:12:57,601 --> 02:13:01,101
This gentleman has brought for you
a letter from some Mr. Salim Ahmed.

704
02:13:26,601 --> 02:13:29,401
On the 26th of this month...

705
02:13:29,601 --> 02:13:35,201
...I'm celebrating grandly the
ceremony of forgetting you.

706
02:13:36,101 --> 02:13:38,901
It's also the day
when I'll be married.

707
02:13:44,601 --> 02:13:48,701
You're requested to perform a dance
on this auspicious occasion.

708
02:13:51,801 --> 02:13:57,701
I hear that you're known all over
for your dancing and singing.

709
02:13:58,601 --> 02:14:02,301
Your's Salim...

710
02:14:16,501 --> 02:14:22,201
The feet which remained
hidden in my heart...

711
02:14:22,401 --> 02:14:27,201
...I'll see those feet dancing
in everybody's presence.

712
02:14:33,901 --> 02:14:37,701
Will I be able to see?

713
02:20:16,901 --> 02:20:21,201
Come and see the sight
of you being insulted.

714
02:20:22,501 --> 02:20:24,501
She's your own honour...

715
02:20:24,901 --> 02:20:30,101
...which is dancing amidst people of
your community in your own home.

716
02:20:30,801 --> 02:20:33,001
It's an assassination of
your self-respect.

717
02:20:33,601 --> 02:20:37,301
"It's your daughter's blood,
on which you've put your feet."

718
02:20:41,601 --> 02:20:44,201
My daughter's blood!
My daughter...?!

719
02:20:47,001 --> 02:20:48,201
My father!

720
02:20:50,601 --> 02:20:55,901
Did you see how that oppressed
woman's blood has bloomed...

721
02:20:56,101 --> 02:20:58,901
...whose blood had dried up
on your sleeves?

722
02:21:00,501 --> 02:21:01,901
What nonsense!

723
02:21:02,601 --> 02:21:06,901
You cannot defame me by
making this allegation.

724
02:21:07,301 --> 02:21:09,301
It's not an allegation.

725
02:21:10,601 --> 02:21:12,901
It's the punishment for
your false pride.

726
02:21:14,801 --> 02:21:18,401
- Recognise her.
- Move away!

727
02:21:22,901 --> 02:21:24,801
- Brother!
- What're you doing?

728
02:21:27,001 --> 02:21:30,101
O Lord! My son!

729
02:21:33,901 --> 02:21:35,201
Uncle!

730
02:21:39,601 --> 02:21:40,901
Uncle!

731
02:21:45,601 --> 02:21:46,501
Uncle!

732
02:21:48,601 --> 02:21:49,901
How did this happen?

733
02:21:55,601 --> 02:21:57,101
She's my daughter.

734
02:21:58,701 --> 02:22:00,201
"No, Shahabuddin."

735
02:22:01,301 --> 02:22:03,501
She is still the
daughter of Nargis.

736
02:22:04,601 --> 02:22:08,301
She cannot be called
your daughter until...

737
02:22:08,501 --> 02:22:14,301
...a marriage procession
doesn't come for her marriage...

738
02:22:14,501 --> 02:22:17,601
...and until her marriage palanquin
is lifted by you from my brothel.

739
02:22:28,501 --> 02:22:30,501
I'll take the marriage procession.

740
02:22:31,501 --> 02:22:33,501
My procession will go there.

741
02:22:36,501 --> 02:22:39,201
Take me along with you.

742
02:22:40,501 --> 02:22:43,501
Take me at all cost... alongwith
your marriage procession!

743
02:22:45,201 --> 02:22:48,501
Uncle! You'll go alongwith
the marriage procession.

744
02:22:49,301 --> 02:22:51,501
The palanquin will be lifted
at your hands.

745
02:22:52,601 --> 02:22:56,101
I assure you. You'll surely
go with the procession.

746
02:22:56,401 --> 02:22:59,001
Her palanquin will surely
be lifted at your hands.

747
02:24:17,201 --> 02:24:19,501
Do you approve of this marriage?

748
02:24:24,001 --> 02:24:25,101
Yes.

749
02:24:30,401 --> 02:24:31,501
Silence!

750
02:25:00,601 --> 02:25:05,901
Give your daughter
the permission to leave.

751
02:25:06,601 --> 02:25:08,501
Give her the permission.

752
02:25:47,601 --> 02:25:53,701
"For thousands of years, a flower
withers away without any recognition."

753
02:25:55,201 --> 02:25:59,401
"Only then comes the one,
truly worthy of praise."
Is it Saaheb Jaan standing?
