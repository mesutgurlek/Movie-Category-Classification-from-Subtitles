00:10:29,830 --> 00:10:31,530
I want to thank you, Mr. Norton,

170
00:10:31,531 --> 00:10:32,932
for your kindness.

171
00:10:32,933 --> 00:10:34,600
Never mind the etiquette.

172
00:10:34,601 --> 00:10:36,535
It's so stupid of me--fainting,

173
00:10:36,536 --> 00:10:38,938
but I haven't eaten much today,

174
00:10:38,939 --> 00:10:41,640
and I...
It's true, isn't it?

175
00:10:41,641 --> 00:10:44,243
You did offer me a job?

176
00:10:44,244 --> 00:10:45,544
What's the matter?

177
00:10:45,545 --> 00:10:47,146
You want it in writing?

178
00:10:47,147 --> 00:10:48,347
Well, no, but...

179
00:10:48,348 --> 00:10:50,416
You're all right, honey.
What's your name?

180
00:10:50,417 --> 00:10:51,951
Mary Blake.

181
00:10:51,952 --> 00:10:53,953
Mary Blake?
Well, that's catchy.

182
00:10:53,954 --> 00:10:56,355
Make yourself at home.
I'll be right with you.

183
00:10:56,356 --> 00:10:58,825
Where do you hail from?

184
00:10:58,826 --> 00:11:01,493
Benson, Colorado.
That's near Denver.

185
00:11:01,494 --> 00:11:03,629
I see.
Been here long?

186
00:11:03,630 --> 00:11:05,832
No. Just a few weeks.

187
00:11:05,833 --> 00:11:07,767
Where have you been working?

188
00:11:07,768 --> 00:11:09,769
The Benson public library.

189
00:11:09,770 --> 00:11:11,170
Singing?

190
00:11:11,171 --> 00:11:13,440
No. I sang
in the church
on Sunday.

191
00:11:14,641 --> 00:11:17,109
Oh, so you sang
in the church choir?

192
00:11:17,110 --> 00:11:18,377
Yes.

193
00:11:18,378 --> 00:11:20,546
You see, it was
my father's old church.

194
00:11:20,547 --> 00:11:23,115
And your father is a preacher?

195
00:11:23,116 --> 00:11:26,719
Yes. He was.

196
00:11:26,720 --> 00:11:30,389
Was? Oh. He got
onto himself, huh?

197
00:11:30,390 --> 00:11:32,960
He died four years ago.

198
00:11:34,194 --> 00:11:35,728
I get it--

199
00:11:35,729 --> 00:11:39,332
the orphan child
of a country parson.

200
00:11:40,667 --> 00:11:42,234
Well, after all, Mr. Norton,

201
00:11:42,235 --> 00:11:44,136
there are such men
as country Parsons.

202
00:11:44,137 --> 00:11:45,938
Sometimes they do
have daughters.

203
00:11:45,939 --> 00:11:48,307
Well, now, that sort of
puts me in my place,

204
00:11:48,308 --> 00:11:49,708
don't it?

205
00:11:49,709 --> 00:11:51,610
Well, who brought you
to San Francisco?

206
00:11:51,611 --> 00:11:54,313
No one. My mother
helped me get here.

207
00:11:54,314 --> 00:11:56,548
Oh, I see.

208
00:11:56,549 --> 00:11:58,751
You don't believe me, do you?

209
00:11:58,752 --> 00:12:01,087
Why, sure, sure.
I believe you.

210
00:12:01,088 --> 00:12:04,056
You're all right, Mary.

211
00:12:04,057 --> 00:12:05,624
Tomorrow we're going to get rid

212
00:12:05,625 --> 00:12:07,126
of those Benson glad rags

213
00:12:07,127 --> 00:12:09,028
and dig you up
some swell, new scenery.

214
00:12:09,029 --> 00:12:11,063
You got all the makings, kid.

215
00:12:11,064 --> 00:12:13,266
Why, you're going to do great.

216
00:12:14,968 --> 00:12:17,070
What's the matter?

217
00:12:18,772 --> 00:12:20,406
Where are you going?

218
00:12:20,407 --> 00:12:21,774
I don't know.

219
00:12:21,775 --> 00:12:23,209
Wait a minute.
Wait a minute.

220
00:12:23,210 --> 00:12:24,743
You don't have to
stall me, honey.

221
00:12:24,744 --> 00:12:26,145
Well, you know,

222
00:12:26,146 --> 00:12:28,147
I wrote that old spiel
you just pulled--

223
00:12:28,148 --> 00:12:29,748
parson father,
sacrificing mother--

224
00:12:29,749 --> 00:12:31,317
the whole thing years ago.

225
00:12:31,318 --> 00:12:33,920
I guess you got
some John on the string.

226
00:12:33,921 --> 00:12:35,521
Is that it?

227
00:12:35,522 --> 00:12:37,656
Please let me go.

228
00:12:37,657 --> 00:12:39,292
I see.

229
00:12:41,061 --> 00:12:44,263
Well, how much
is the railroad fare

230
00:12:44,264 --> 00:12:45,899
here from Benson?

231
00:12:48,268 --> 00:12:49,768
I paid $16.80.

232
00:12:49,769 --> 00:12:51,203
Tomorrow morning, I'll have babe

233
00:12:51,204 --> 00:12:53,272
give you an advance
in salary--$20.

234
00:12:53,273 --> 00:12:55,207
You can send for
that mug you're stuck on.

235
00:12:55,208 --> 00:12:56,843
You know, I admire a woman

236
00:12:56,844 --> 00:12:58,444
you can trust out of town.

237
00:12:58,445 --> 00:13:02,281
Getting late.
You can bunk here,
if you want to.

238
00:13:02,282 --> 00:13:03,917
Try the sofa.

239
00:14:01,108 --> 00:14:02,976
Good night, sucker.

240
00:14:21,328 --> 00:14:22,561
Hey, Blackie,

241
00:14:22,562 --> 00:14:24,163
the professor's
waiting for
that new girl

242
00:14:24,164 --> 00:14:25,797
to show up for rehearsal.

243
00:14:25,798 --> 00:14:29,368
She hasn't shown up.

244
00:14:29,369 --> 00:14:30,669
No good, huh?

245
00:14:30,670 --> 00:14:32,571
I'll say she's good.
Her father was a preacher.

246
00:14:32,572 --> 00:14:34,640
Are you falling for
that old preacher
gag?

247
00:14:34,641 --> 00:14:36,542
Maybe her father wasa preacher.

248
00:14:36,543 --> 00:14:39,745
Oh, so you
still believe
in Santa clause?

249
00:14:39,746 --> 00:14:41,747
Trouble with you is you don't
believe in anything.

250
00:14:41,748 --> 00:14:42,982
Oh, that's where I'm smart.

251
00:14:42,983 --> 00:14:44,650
Did you say smart?

252
00:14:44,651 --> 00:14:46,319
That's what I said.

253
00:14:52,325 --> 00:14:53,926
I'm a sucker if I'll
ever learn anything.

254
00:14:53,927 --> 00:14:55,627
For 20 years that mug
has mauled me around

255
00:14:55,628 --> 00:14:56,929
making a chump out of me,

256
00:14:56,930 --> 00:14:58,931
and I always come back for more.

257
00:14:58,932 --> 00:15:00,599
He got to bed
earlier than you
last night.

258
00:15:00,600 --> 00:15:01,968
Come on.
Get up.

259
00:15:01,969 --> 00:15:03,702
I'm not going to move
from this spot

260
00:15:03,703 --> 00:15:05,304
till you're out of the building.

261
00:15:05,305 --> 00:15:06,705
Ha ha ha!

262
00:15:06,706 --> 00:15:08,975
All right, kid.
So long, mug.

263
00:15:08,976 --> 00:15:10,876
Hey, that guy packs
an awful wallop,

264
00:15:10,877 --> 00:15:12,544
don't he?

265
00:15:12,545 --> 00:15:13,946
Yeah.

266
00:15:13,947 --> 00:15:15,347
Is he gone?

267
00:15:15,348 --> 00:15:17,116
Uh-huh.
Look at the parade.

268
00:15:17,117 --> 00:15:18,817
Hello, Blackie.
Hello, mat.

269
00:15:18,818 --> 00:15:21,087
Hello, boys.

270
00:15:21,088 --> 00:15:22,821
Blackie, would you like to...

271
00:15:22,822 --> 00:15:24,223
Yeah. Thanks.

272
00:15:24,224 --> 00:15:25,857
Someone just
showed me to a seat.

273
00:15:25,858 --> 00:15:28,961
Mat, get me my robe, will you?

274
00:15:28,962 --> 00:15:30,696
Blackie, we've looked you up

275
00:15:30,697 --> 00:15:32,064
to complain about that fire

276
00:15:32,065 --> 00:15:33,565
last night on dupont street.

277
00:15:33,566 --> 00:15:35,167
Complain? I thought
it was perfect.

278
00:15:35,168 --> 00:15:36,835
What do you boys want
in the way of a fire?

279
00:15:36,836 --> 00:15:38,570
You talk better at the meeting--

280
00:15:38,571 --> 00:15:40,039
sitting down.

281
00:15:40,040 --> 00:15:41,707
Jim Sullivan's kids got trapped

282
00:15:41,708 --> 00:15:43,342
in that fire last night.

283
00:15:43,343 --> 00:15:45,277
They had to jump for it.

284
00:15:45,278 --> 00:15:46,945
Yeah. I know.
I saw.

285
00:15:46,946 --> 00:15:48,314
They pulled it off

286
00:15:48,315 --> 00:15:49,982
like circus performers.

287
00:15:49,983 --> 00:15:51,517
Mr. Norton,
you ain't got no kids.

288
00:15:51,518 --> 00:15:54,520
I got plenty kids--
Luigi, Pedro, Maria,

289
00:15:54,521 --> 00:15:55,921
and little Tony,

290
00:15:55,922 --> 00:15:58,024
and maybe more when I get home.

291
00:15:58,025 --> 00:15:59,691
[Man]
Don't go home.

292
00:15:59,692 --> 00:16:01,093
Well, look, boys,

293
00:16:01,094 --> 00:16:02,694
put me down for 100 bucks

294
00:16:02,695 --> 00:16:04,030
for Jim and the kids.

295
00:16:04,031 --> 00:16:05,397
That isn't what
we came for,
Blackie.

296
00:16:05,398 --> 00:16:09,401
We want to run you
for supervisor.

297
00:16:09,402 --> 00:16:10,902
What?

298
00:16:10,903 --> 00:16:12,338
That's right, Blackie.

299
00:16:12,339 --> 00:16:14,706
The only way
to get decent
fire regulations

300
00:16:14,707 --> 00:16:16,108
on the coast is to force them

301
00:16:16,109 --> 00:16:17,476
through the board
of supervisors.

302
00:16:17,477 --> 00:16:19,145
You're the only man on the coast

303
00:16:19,146 --> 00:16:20,546
with the, uh...

304
00:16:20,547 --> 00:16:21,547
Authority...

305
00:16:21,548 --> 00:16:23,015
To do it.

306
00:16:23,016 --> 00:16:25,751
There's nobody else
crazy enough--

307
00:16:25,752 --> 00:16:27,053
ixnay.
Shut up!

308
00:16:27,054 --> 00:16:28,854
Yeah, and maybe I'm not either.

309
00:16:28,855 --> 00:16:30,156
I think it's a great idea.

310
00:16:30,157 --> 00:16:31,857
Well, hello, father.

311
00:16:31,858 --> 00:16:33,159
Why, certainly.
It's dynamite.

312
00:16:33,160 --> 00:16:34,660
Supervisor Norton--
you'll get the joint

313
00:16:34,661 --> 00:16:36,228
a million dollars'
worth of publicity.

314
00:16:36,229 --> 00:16:37,829
Well, what do you say?

315
00:16:37,830 --> 00:16:39,298
Where will you get the dough?

316
00:16:39,299 --> 00:16:40,832
We'll back you, Blackie.

317
00:16:40,833 --> 00:16:42,234
Up to the limit.

318
00:16:42,235 --> 00:16:43,835
Father Mullin, you speak to him.

319
00:16:43,836 --> 00:16:45,171
You like a fight,
Blackie. Go on.

320
00:16:45,172 --> 00:16:47,005
Have you all gone crazy?

321
00:16:47,006 --> 00:16:48,407
I can't do anything with him.

322
00:16:48,408 --> 00:16:49,741
I've been trying for 20 years.

323
00:16:49,742 --> 00:16:51,710
Maybe you fellas can.
So long. Good luck.

324
00:16:51,711 --> 00:16:53,179
Bye, Tim.

325
00:16:53,180 --> 00:16:55,047
Well, Blackie, what about it?

326
00:16:55,048 --> 00:16:56,848
Come on over to the bar.

327
00:16:56,849 --> 00:16:58,184
Let's have a drink.

328
00:16:58,185 --> 00:16:59,885
Can you
imagine what
that Nob Hill guy

329
00:16:59,886 --> 00:17:01,521
is going to say--

330
00:17:07,527 --> 00:17:09,861
there won't be any competition.

331
00:17:09,862 --> 00:17:11,297
Mr. Norton, I tell you what.

332
00:17:11,298 --> 00:17:13,432

and I don't care if you fire me.

498
00:23:33,245 --> 00:23:35,647
At least I've had
the opportunity
to help a girl.

499
00:23:35,648 --> 00:23:37,483
Well, who said I was firing you?

500
00:23:37,484 --> 00:23:38,850
Now, come on.
Get going.

501
00:23:38,851 --> 00:23:41,386
Yes. Thank you,
Mr. Norton.
Thank you.

502
00:23:41,387 --> 00:23:42,921
I'd like to meet that girl.

503
00:23:42,922 --> 00:23:44,322
Oh, waiter.

504
00:23:44,323 --> 00:23:45,724
[Waiter]
Yes, Mr. Burley?

505
00:23:45,725 --> 00:23:47,325
See if miss Blake will meet

506
00:23:47,326 --> 00:23:48,794
a respectful admirer.

507
00:23:48,795 --> 00:23:50,395
I haven't
had her working
at the boxers yet.

508
00:23:50,396 --> 00:23:52,030
I'm glad of that.

509
00:23:52,031 --> 00:23:53,465
One never knows

510
00:23:53,466 --> 00:23:54,900
where one's going to
find talent.

511
00:23:54,901 --> 00:23:57,736
No. No.
One never does,
does one?

512
00:23:57,737 --> 00:24:00,171
Yes, and I quote from Plautus.

513
00:24:00,172 --> 00:24:03,341
[Speaking Latin]

514
00:24:03,342 --> 00:24:05,076
Yeah. You took the words

515
00:24:05,077 --> 00:24:06,578
right out of my mouth.

516
00:24:06,579 --> 00:24:08,214
Mr. Burley?

517
00:24:09,348 --> 00:24:10,616
It's very gracious of you

518
00:24:10,617 --> 00:24:11,850
to allow us
this privilege,
miss Blake.

519
00:24:11,851 --> 00:24:13,251
Thank you.

520
00:24:13,252 --> 00:24:14,753
May I present signor baldini?

521
00:24:14,754 --> 00:24:16,488
How do you do, signor?

522
00:24:16,489 --> 00:24:18,123
Good evening, my dear.

523
00:24:18,124 --> 00:24:19,457
Won't you sit down?

524
00:24:19,458 --> 00:24:21,326
Waiter, a bottle
of cordon Rouge '94.

525
00:24:21,327 --> 00:24:22,728
You bet, sir.

526
00:24:22,729 --> 00:24:24,429
And the usual for you?

527
00:24:24,430 --> 00:24:26,431
Yes.
A little water.

528
00:24:26,432 --> 00:24:28,366
Hearing a voice like yours

529
00:24:28,367 --> 00:24:30,035
in the variety theater

530
00:24:30,036 --> 00:24:32,237
has been for me
a great experience.

531
00:24:32,238 --> 00:24:33,639
Thank you, signor,

532
00:24:33,640 --> 00:24:35,040
but you might have heard me

533
00:24:35,041 --> 00:24:36,642
under more favorable
circumstances.

534
00:24:36,643 --> 00:24:39,244
I sat in
the outer office
of the tivoli

535
00:24:39,245 --> 00:24:41,379
for six days once.

536
00:24:41,380 --> 00:24:43,448
So you want to sing in opera?

537
00:24:43,449 --> 00:24:45,383
That's why I came
to San Francisco.

538
00:24:45,384 --> 00:24:46,918
You have the training, too?

539
00:24:46,919 --> 00:24:48,754
Yes, with the best
teacher in Denver.

540
00:24:48,755 --> 00:24:50,722
I led the Bach choral society,

541
00:24:50,723 --> 00:24:52,791
I won first prize
at the Schubert festival,

542
00:24:52,792 --> 00:24:54,926
and I've done
violetta, Marguerite,

543
00:24:54,927 --> 00:24:57,663
puccini's Mimi, and Tosca.

544
00:24:57,664 --> 00:24:59,264
I love Puccini.

545
00:24:59,265 --> 00:25:00,599
Oh, Puccini.

546
00:25:00,600 --> 00:25:02,033
[Speaking Italian]

547
00:25:02,034 --> 00:25:04,002
Did you ever hear
of Puccini, Norton?

548
00:25:04,003 --> 00:25:05,537
Yeah. Didn't he run a joint

549
00:25:05,538 --> 00:25:07,138
down on dupont street?

550
00:25:07,139 --> 00:25:09,074
Ha ha ha!

551
00:25:09,075 --> 00:25:10,842
Well, there's no law
against an opera singer

552
00:25:10,843 --> 00:25:13,044
being slender and young
and beautiful.

553
00:25:13,045 --> 00:25:14,145
What do you think

554
00:25:14,146 --> 00:25:16,181
about giving miss Blake
an audition?

555
00:25:16,182 --> 00:25:17,616
Yes, by all means.

556
00:25:17,617 --> 00:25:19,517
Say, that's darn sweet
of you, Burley--

557
00:25:19,518 --> 00:25:20,919
to take an interest
in the little lady,

558
00:25:20,920 --> 00:25:22,588
and you, too, signor,

559
00:25:22,589 --> 00:25:24,122
but she's under
a two-year contract.

560
00:25:24,123 --> 00:25:25,557
To whom?

561
00:25:25,558 --> 00:25:27,225
To me.

562
00:25:27,226 --> 00:25:28,459
Two years?

563
00:25:28,460 --> 00:25:30,696
Yes, but I'll have
her notify you
when it runs out.

564
00:25:30,697 --> 00:25:32,130
Surely you wouldn't let that

565
00:25:32,131 --> 00:25:34,566
stand in her way
to sing in
the tivoli.

566
00:25:34,567 --> 00:25:36,602
Why? She's doing all right here.

567
00:25:36,603 --> 00:25:38,369
I'm sorry, miss Blake.

568
00:25:38,370 --> 00:25:40,972
Mr. Norton's quite right.

569
00:25:40,973 --> 00:25:43,709
After all, paradise is
just as important to him

570
00:25:43,710 --> 00:25:45,410
as the tivoli is to you.

571
00:25:45,411 --> 00:25:46,812
What would happen to the tivoli

572
00:25:46,813 --> 00:25:48,413
if its artists were
allowed to walk out

573
00:25:48,414 --> 00:25:49,815
anytime they pleased?

574
00:25:49,816 --> 00:25:52,718
You are a very
loyal girl, miss Blake.

575
00:25:52,719 --> 00:25:54,887
No. I'm very grateful
to Mr. Norton.

576
00:25:59,892 --> 00:26:02,360
Well...

577
00:26:02,361 --> 00:26:03,829
Well, I'll be going.

578
00:26:03,830 --> 00:26:05,430
We don't have much time
between numbers.

579
00:26:05,431 --> 00:26:06,765
Thank you, signor.

580
00:26:06,766 --> 00:26:08,466
This has been the happiest night

581
00:26:08,467 --> 00:26:10,368
of my life.

582
00:26:10,369 --> 00:26:11,737
Bye.

583
00:26:11,738 --> 00:26:13,471
I haven't given up yet

584
00:26:13,472 --> 00:26:14,940
about the tivoli.

585
00:26:14,941 --> 00:26:16,642
You don't know Mr. Norton.

586
00:26:16,643 --> 00:26:18,644
You don't know me.

587
00:26:18,645 --> 00:26:20,245
Good-bye.

588
00:26:20,246 --> 00:26:21,546
Good-bye.

589
00:26:21,547 --> 00:26:24,817
Just a minute.
I want to see you.

590
00:26:27,754 --> 00:26:29,354
Who told you to sing
that highbrow number?

591
00:26:29,355 --> 00:26:30,822
No one.

592
00:26:30,823 --> 00:26:32,457
Well, now that you've
made your impression,

593
00:26:32,458 --> 00:26:33,825
don't do it again.

594
00:26:33,826 --> 00:26:35,360
Blackie doesn't like it.

595
00:26:35,361 --> 00:26:36,762
Friend of mine runs a joint

596
00:26:36,763 --> 00:26:38,163
around on kearney street.

597
00:26:38,164 --> 00:26:39,798
I want you to hurry around there

598
00:26:39,799 --> 00:26:41,532
and tear up
a little number for him.

599
00:26:41,533 --> 00:26:43,134
All right.
Where is it?

600
00:26:43,135 --> 00:26:45,136
St. Anne's mission--
just around the corner.

601
00:26:45,137 --> 00:26:46,504
St. Anne's?

602
00:26:46,505 --> 00:26:48,006
Yes. Ask for father Mullin.

603
00:26:48,007 --> 00:26:50,041
You know
the hokey-pokey
they sing there.

604
00:26:50,042 --> 00:26:52,243
You've got a number
to do back here
at 10:30.

605
00:26:52,244 --> 00:26:53,812
We won't need that now.

606
00:26:53,813 --> 00:26:56,181
Burley, you don't
want me to run
for supervisor?

607
00:26:56,182 --> 00:26:57,649
You know as well as I

608
00:26:57,650 --> 00:26:58,917
it's not practical
to rebuild the coast.

609
00:26:58,918 --> 00:27:00,518
The coast is picturesque.

610
00:27:00,519 --> 00:27:02,253
People come down here slumming.

611
00:27:02,254 --> 00:27:03,655
They don't want to feel

612
00:27:03,656 --> 00:27:05,156
like they're in a spotless town.

613
00:27:05,157 --> 00:27:06,792
But that isn't your real reason.

614
00:27:06,793 --> 00:27:08,526
The main one is
you don't want to
spend your dough

615
00:27:08,527 --> 00:27:10,161
to make your property
down here safe.

616
00:27:10,162 --> 00:27:11,897
If I did what you wanted me to,

617
00:27:11,898 --> 00:27:13,631
it would be
a calamity
for the coast.

618
00:27:13,632 --> 00:27:15,033
The Burley estate has to make

619
00:27:15,034 --> 00:27:16,668
certain interest
on its investment.

620
00:27:16,669 --> 00:27:18,536
I'd have to raise rents.

621
00:27:18,537 --> 00:27:19,971
You boys couldn't live.

622
00:27:19,972 --> 00:27:22,073
You'd have to
charge 10 cents
for a glass of beer.

623
00:27:22,074 --> 00:27:23,641
I don't get him, Mr. baldini.

624
00:27:23,642 --> 00:27:25,043
He tosses a fortune every year

625
00:27:25,044 --> 00:27:26,878
to the tivoli opera house.

626
00:27:26,879 --> 00:27:28,479
But that's not business.
That's for San Francisco.

627
00:27:28,480 --> 00:27:29,948
The coast is San Francisco, too.

628
00:27:29,949 --> 00:27:31,482
That's why I wouldn't change it.

629
00:27:31,483 --> 00:27:33,318
These little mugs down here

630
00:27:33,319 --> 00:27:34,820
are my people.

631
00:27:34,821 --> 00:27:36,254
I'll see
that they get
a square deal,

632
00:27:36,255 --> 00:27:37,956
so I'm not pulling
out of this fight.

633
00:27:37,957 --> 00:27:40,425
I don't want
to fight you, Norton,

634
00:27:40,426 --> 00:27:41,960
but you're asking for it.

635
00:27:41,961 --> 00:27:43,930
I'm not ducking anything.

636
00:27:45,364 --> 00:27:46,765
Good night.

637
00:27:46,766 --> 00:27:48,433
Good night.

638
00:27:48,434 --> 00:27:50,036
Good night.

639
00:27:51,570 --> 00:27:53,571
You're wanted
on the phone, boss.

640
00:27:53,572 --> 00:27:55,441
O.K.

641
00:27:57,443 --> 00:27:59,177
Hello.

642
00:27:59,178 --> 00:28:00,645
Oh, hello, Tim.

643
00:28:00,646 --> 00:28:03,048
Why don't you come on over?

644
00:28:03,049 --> 00:28:04,215
What for?

645
00:28:04,216 --> 00:28:06,384
The organ recital
and to hear
the young lady.

646
00:28:06,385 --> 00:28:07,753
She'll be coming back here

647
00:28:07,754 --> 00:28:09,120
to sing the things I like.

648
00:28:09,121 --> 00:28:11,990
All right. Have it your own way.

649
00:28:11,991 --> 00:28:14,025
I was just sort of hoping

650
00:28:14,026 --> 00:28:16,061
you'd make my evening complete.

651
00:28:16,062 --> 00:28:18,296
If I had you here now,
I'd hug you,

652
00:28:18,297 --> 00:28:20,531
and then I'd knock
your block off.

653
00:28:20,532 --> 00:28:22,000
Ha ha ha!

654
00:28:22,001 --> 00:28:24,202
I don't have to
tell you how I feel
about the organ.

655
00:28:24,203 --> 00:28:25,470
Ah, forget it.

656
00:28:25,471 --> 00:28:27,807
All right, Blackie.
Good-bye.

00:28:57,736 --> 00:29:03,909

662

00:29:19,725 --> 00:29:25,931

672
00:30:17,183 --> 00:30:19,084
oh, father, that was
simply marvelous.

673
00:30:19,085 --> 00:30:21,119
And that little boy.
Wasn't he sweet?

674
00:30:21,120 --> 00:30:22,954
Can you get home all right?

675
00:30:22,955 --> 00:30:24,455
Yes, thank you.

676
00:30:24,456 --> 00:30:25,756
Good night.

677
00:30:25,757 --> 00:30:26,791
Hey, Mike.

678
00:30:26,792 --> 00:30:27,825
Yes, father?

679
00:30:27,826 --> 00:30:29,160
Got any money?

680
00:30:29,161 --> 00:30:31,396
Sure, father.
Me wife's got a job.

681
00:30:31,397 --> 00:30:33,932
Good night.
Good night. Good night.

682
00:30:33,933 --> 00:30:35,366
Good night, father Mullin.

683
00:30:35,367 --> 00:30:38,870
It was very nice
of you to leave work
and rescue us.

684
00:30:38,871 --> 00:30:40,405
It made me feel good being here.

685
00:30:40,406 --> 00:30:42,941
You're not the girl
whose father was
a preacher, are you?

686
00:30:42,942 --> 00:30:44,509
Well, yes.
How did you know?

687
00:30:44,510 --> 00:30:47,112
Blackie told me.
I'd like to talk to you.

688
00:30:47,113 --> 00:30:48,880
But I'm afraid I'll be late.

689
00:30:48,881 --> 00:30:50,715
That's O.K. I'll fix it
with Blackie.

690
00:30:50,716 --> 00:30:52,951
Will you join me
in a cup of coffee?

691
00:30:52,952 --> 00:30:54,752
Yes. I'd like to.
Thank you.

692
00:30:54,753 --> 00:30:56,454
I make good coffee.

693
00:30:56,455 --> 00:30:59,857
How are you making out
at the paradise?

694
00:30:59,858 --> 00:31:01,993
Well, I've only just started.

695
00:31:01,994 --> 00:31:03,761
I see. Sit down there,
won't you?

696
00:31:03,762 --> 00:31:05,030
Thank you.

697
00:31:05,031 --> 00:31:07,032
How do you like Blackie?

698
00:31:07,033 --> 00:31:08,366
I'm afraid of him.

699
00:31:08,367 --> 00:31:11,136
Ah. And he's someone
to be afraid of.

700
00:31:11,137 --> 00:31:12,770
He's as unscrupulous with women

701
00:31:12,771 --> 00:31:14,772
as he is ruthless with men.

702
00:31:14,773 --> 00:31:17,042
But why did he
send me down here?

703
00:31:17,043 --> 00:31:18,643
I don't understand him.

704
00:31:18,644 --> 00:31:19,545
You don't, huh?

705
00:31:19,546 --> 00:31:20,611
No.

706
00:31:20,612 --> 00:31:22,047
Ha ha ha!

707
00:31:22,048 --> 00:31:24,082
What's the matter?

708
00:31:24,083 --> 00:31:26,117
You probably understand Blackie

709
00:31:26,118 --> 00:31:29,888
a whole lot better
than he understands you.

710
00:31:31,823 --> 00:31:34,292
You see, I don't think
Blackie ever knew

711
00:31:34,293 --> 00:31:36,461
your type of woman before.

712
00:31:36,462 --> 00:31:38,930
But there's nothing
to be afraid of,

713
00:31:38,931 --> 00:31:40,631
unless you're afraid
of yourself.

714
00:31:40,632 --> 00:31:42,301
Are you?

715
00:31:43,802 --> 00:31:45,170
No.

716
00:31:45,171 --> 00:31:47,405
No, I guess I'm a little dazed.

717
00:31:47,406 --> 00:31:50,208
You see, I've been
in San Francisco
for over six weeks,

718
00:31:50,209 --> 00:31:51,909
and nothing ever happened,

719
00:31:51,910 --> 00:31:54,212
and then, within
the last 24 hours,

720
00:31:54,213 --> 00:31:56,214
the whole world's
gone Topsy-turvy.

721
00:31:56,215 --> 00:31:58,217
Makes me feel like running home.

722
00:31:58,985 --> 00:32:00,952
Well, if you are afraid,

723
00:32:00,953 --> 00:32:02,687
you'd better run home.

724
00:32:02,688 --> 00:32:04,755
How about it?

725
00:32:04,756 --> 00:32:06,657
I'm going to stay.

726
00:32:06,658 --> 00:32:09,060
That's right.

727
00:32:09,061 --> 00:32:11,296
You're in probably
the wickedest,
most corrupt,

728
00:32:11,297 --> 00:32:13,164
most godless city in America.

729
00:32:13,165 --> 00:32:14,565
Sometimes it frightens me.

730
00:32:14,566 --> 00:32:16,634
I wonder what the end
is going to be.

731
00:32:16,635 --> 00:32:19,437
But nothing can
harm you if you
don't allow it to,

732
00:32:19,438 --> 00:32:21,139
because nothing in the world,

733
00:32:21,140 --> 00:32:23,508
no one in the world, is all bad.

734
00:32:23,509 --> 00:32:25,643
Do you know who gave the chapel

735
00:32:25,644 --> 00:32:27,445
that organ we've been
dedicating tonight?

736
00:32:27,446 --> 00:32:29,514
The most godless, scoffing,

737
00:32:29,515 --> 00:32:32,450
and unbelieving soul
in all San Francisco--

738
00:32:32,451 --> 00:32:34,185
Blackie Norton.

739
00:32:34,186 --> 00:32:36,454
Blackie heard
one night that I was
saving for an organ.

740
00:32:36,455 --> 00:32:38,956
The very next morning,
men arrived to plan
the installation.

741
00:32:38,957 --> 00:32:40,391
Cost him $4,000.

742
00:32:40,392 --> 00:32:43,161
If that monkey
would save his money
for a few weeks,

743
00:32:43,162 --> 00:32:44,529
he'd be rich.

744
00:32:44,530 --> 00:32:46,431
He's a tremendous force,
Blackie is.

745
00:32:46,432 --> 00:32:50,201
If he were only
a force for good
instead of evil.

746
00:32:50,202 --> 00:32:53,271
I've tried to do
something with him
for years,

747
00:32:53,272 --> 00:32:55,306
but I haven't had any luck.

748
00:32:55,307 --> 00:32:57,609
Maybe I'm not the right one.

749
00:32:58,744 --> 00:33:01,146
You've known each
other a long time,
haven't you?

750
00:33:01,147 --> 00:33:04,049
Oh, sure, sure.
Blackie and I
were kids together.

751
00:33:04,050 --> 00:33:06,017
Born and brought up
on the coast.

752
00:33:06,018 --> 00:33:07,518
We used to sell newspapers

753
00:33:07,519 --> 00:33:09,420
in the joints
along pacific street.

754
00:33:09,421 --> 00:33:11,756
Blackie was
the leader of
the neighborhood kids,

755
00:33:11,757 --> 00:33:13,324
and I was his pal.

756
00:33:13,325 --> 00:33:16,994
Our families used to
try to get us to go
to mass on Sunday,

757
00:33:16,995 --> 00:33:18,563
but we generally ducked.

758
00:33:18,564 --> 00:33:20,998
That reminds me,
that Rooney kid
ducked mass.

759
00:33:20,999 --> 00:33:23,301
And then I got
so I wanted to go.

760
00:33:23,302 --> 00:33:25,436
Blackie thought I was crazy.

761
00:33:25,437 --> 00:33:28,106
And when I decided
I was going to study
for the priesthood,

762
00:33:28,107 --> 00:33:29,574
I wanted to talk to Blackie.

763
00:33:29,575 --> 00:33:31,442
I wanted to see
if I couldn't get him
to understand,

764
00:33:31,443 --> 00:33:33,544
to feel a little bit as I felt,

765
00:33:33,545 --> 00:33:36,181
but he just said, "well,
good luck, sucker,"

766
00:33:36,182 --> 00:33:37,548
and that was all.

767
00:33:37,549 --> 00:33:39,317
We never were able
to have that talk.

768
00:33:39,318 --> 00:33:41,052
I came back from college
and found Blackie

769
00:33:41,053 --> 00:33:44,055
deeper than ever
in the life of the coast.

770
00:33:44,056 --> 00:33:45,623
But he has a code.

771
00:33:45,624 --> 00:33:48,159
He's always had,
ever since
we were kids.

772
00:33:48,160 --> 00:33:49,994
He never lied, he never cheated,

773
00:33:49,995 --> 00:33:54,332
and he never
took an underhanded
advantage of anyone.

774
00:33:54,333 --> 00:33:58,804
There's a picture
of us together
when we were kids.

775
00:34:00,772 --> 00:34:02,207
Hmm.

776
00:34:02,208 --> 00:34:04,275
Oh, don't let him
know I told you
about the organ.

777
00:34:04,276 --> 00:34:05,810
He'd never forgive me.

778
00:34:05,811 --> 00:34:08,213
Oh, no. Oh, no, I won't.

779
00:34:08,214 --> 00:34:10,348
He's that way, Blackie is.

780
00:34:10,349 --> 00:34:12,250
Ashamed of his good deeds

781
00:34:12,251 --> 00:34:15,052
as other people
are ashamed of their sins.

782
00:34:15,053 --> 00:34:16,654
And nobody will ever
make me believe

00:36:23,315 --> 00:36:26,517
I won't stop until I get
some decent fire laws

820
00:36:26,518 --> 00:36:28,986
for our people
down on the coast.

821

[Cheering]

822
00:36:32,023 --> 00:36:33,591
[Man]
Wait a minute, Norton.

823
00:36:33,592 --> 00:36:36,594
What I want to know is,
what construction company

824
00:36:36,595 --> 00:36:38,929
is paying you
for trying to
rebuild the coast?

825
00:36:38,930 --> 00:36:42,099
Yeah. That's right.
How about it, Blackie?

826
00:36:42,100 --> 00:36:43,768
Why are you going into politics?

827
00:36:43,769 --> 00:36:45,035
Tell us, Norton.

828
00:36:45,036 --> 00:36:48,239
Here's the answer you can take
to your boss Jack Burley.

829
00:36:48,240 --> 00:36:49,708
Oh! Oh!

830
00:36:55,247 --> 00:36:57,014
We've tried long enough
to get a square deal

831
00:36:57,015 --> 00:36:59,817
from those potbellied
landowners up on Nob Hill.

832
00:36:59,818 --> 00:37:02,687
Now we're going to
go after it on our own!

833
00:37:02,688 --> 00:37:04,389
Wait a minute.
Wait a minute.

834
00:37:04,390 --> 00:37:05,924
Tommy, come here.

835
00:37:08,460 --> 00:37:10,428
This is Jim Sullivan's kid.

836
00:37:10,429 --> 00:37:11,929
Last new year's Eve,
he and his sister

837
00:37:11,930 --> 00:37:15,734
had to jump three floors
out of a burning building.

838
00:37:17,803 --> 00:37:20,338
Are we going to go on
letting these Nob Hill stiffs

839
00:37:20,339 --> 00:37:23,007
make fire dancers
out of our women and kids?

840
00:37:23,008 --> 00:37:25,042
Not if I can help it!

841
00:37:25,043 --> 00:37:26,712
Yeah! Yeah!

842
00:37:29,180 --> 00:37:33,285
And now, free beer on me!

843
00:37:36,588 --> 00:37:39,557
You were swell!
I'm so proud
of you, I--

844
00:37:39,558 --> 00:37:42,360
thanks. Run along
and get yourself
some beer.

845
00:37:42,361 --> 00:37:43,728
Aren't we going to be together?

846
00:37:43,729 --> 00:37:45,930
I told you I'd be busy
when I brought you here.

847
00:37:45,931 --> 00:37:46,964
Well, I'll wait for you.

848
00:37:46,965 --> 00:37:49,935
You get yourself
a drink. That's a girl.

849
00:37:52,871 --> 00:37:54,905
Professor, will you
do me a favor?

850
00:37:54,906 --> 00:37:56,040
Sure.

851
00:37:56,041 --> 00:37:58,676
Go and get Trixie
and take her back
to town.

852
00:37:58,677 --> 00:37:59,810
To town?

853
00:37:59,811 --> 00:38:01,679
Yeah. She's
hanging around
getting stiff.

854
00:38:01,680 --> 00:38:03,314
Then what about miss Blake?

855
00:38:03,315 --> 00:38:04,415
Oh. How do you do?

856
00:38:04,416 --> 00:38:05,450
How do you do?

857
00:38:05,451 --> 00:38:06,751
I brought her out here.

858
00:38:06,752 --> 00:38:08,887
I'll see that she
gets home all right.

859

[Waltz playing]

860

That's awful pretty.
Know the name of it?

00:38:22,334 --> 00:38:24,335
Would you?

862
00:38:24,336 --> 00:38:25,837
Would I what?

00:39:03,241 --> 00:39:04,274
Glad you came?

864
00:39:04,275 --> 00:39:05,376
Yes.

865
00:39:05,377 --> 00:39:06,844
What's the matter?

866
00:39:06,845 --> 00:39:08,113
Nothing.

867
00:39:11,116 --> 00:39:13,584
Do you mind
going a little
faster, please?

868
00:39:13,585 --> 00:39:15,252
I promised father Mullin

869
00:39:15,253 --> 00:39:17,221
I'd stop by if I had time.

870
00:39:17,222 --> 00:39:18,923
Yeah, sure.

871
00:39:18,924 --> 00:39:22,226
Go on. Get up there!

You and Tim seem
to be hitting it off
pretty well.

Oh, yes.

874
00:39:26,264 --> 00:39:27,532
What do you talk about?

875
00:39:27,533 --> 00:39:29,634
Lots of things.
His work, mostly.

876
00:39:29,635 --> 00:39:30,868
Oh, yeah, that's right.

877
00:39:30,869 --> 00:39:32,770
You believe in that hocus-pocus.

878
00:39:32,771 --> 00:39:34,104
Yes.

879
00:39:34,105 --> 00:39:35,540
Even if I hadn't believed,

880
00:39:35,541 --> 00:39:37,775
the faith of a man
like father Mullin
would make me.

881
00:39:37,776 --> 00:39:39,076
Yeah, that's the trouble.

882
00:39:39,077 --> 00:39:40,711
It gets hold of people
that are all right

883
00:39:40,712 --> 00:39:42,246
and makes monkeys out of them.

884
00:39:42,247 --> 00:39:43,648
It lost me Tim Mullin.

885

He'd have made
the greatest gambler
on the coast.

He loves you more
than anyone else
in the world.

888

Yeah? Well, he
blew me for a lot
of plaster saints.

889
00:39:52,257 --> 00:39:55,560
You know, I don't
go for that sucker
competition, Mary.

890

Blackie's got to be
number-one boy.

891

But it isn't competition.

892
00:39:59,498 --> 00:40:01,766
I think people who
believe in something

893
00:40:01,767 --> 00:40:03,834
can love each other more.

No.

That all your dough?

00:42:34,686 --> 00:42:36,053
Every dime.

931
00:42:36,054 --> 00:42:38,623
Here's 100 bucks.
Go get yourself a cup of coffee.

932
00:42:38,624 --> 00:42:39,790
Gee, thanks, Blackie.

933
00:42:39,791 --> 00:42:41,859
I guess I'll get some sleep.

Hey, chick. Put this
stuff away, will you?

Good morning, Burley.

Anything I can do for you?

939
00:42:48,333 --> 00:42:51,001
I want to buy that
contract you have
with miss Blake.

940
00:42:51,002 --> 00:42:52,469
You think it's for sale?

941
00:42:52,470 --> 00:42:54,972
I don't see why
you're so stubborn
about it, Norton.

942
00:42:54,973 --> 00:42:56,641
You might be needing money.

943
00:42:56,642 --> 00:42:58,008
I'm doing all right.

944

You may be in for
a few difficulties
down here.

945

What do you mean?

946
00:43:01,112 --> 00:43:03,013
Ever hear of
the Johnson-addi
gambling ordinance?

947
00:43:03,014 --> 00:43:03,949
Yep.

948
00:43:03,950 --> 00:43:05,683
You're operating
against the law.

So's every other joint here.

950
00:43:07,152 --> 00:43:08,819
Well, I'm just
telling you, that's all.

951
00:43:08,820 --> 00:43:10,621
You've taken quite an interest

952
00:43:10,622 --> 00:43:12,522
in the little lady, haven't you?

953
00:43:12,523 --> 00:43:14,024
I'm only interested
in making her

954
00:43:14,025 --> 00:43:16,493
a useful member
of the tivoli
opera company.

955
00:43:16,494 --> 00:43:19,129
Yeah. Now, isn't that
sweet of you?

956
00:43:19,130 --> 00:43:21,666
Well, I'll tell you
what I'll do, Burley.

957
00:43:21,667 --> 00:43:23,533
If the little lady
wants to leave me,

958
00:43:23,534 --> 00:43:25,302
you can have
her contract
for nothing.

* let's do the same as they? **

962
00:43:40,385 --> 00:43:41,652

963
00:43:41,653 --> 00:43:43,387
Yes?

964
00:43:43,388 --> 00:43:45,023
Come here a minute, will you?

965
00:43:46,658 --> 00:43:48,192
You're taking
a long chance,
Blackie.

966
00:43:48,193 --> 00:43:51,863
Yep. Maybe I got an Ace
or two in the hole, too.

967
00:43:53,198 --> 00:43:54,364
Oh, Mr. Burley.

968
00:43:54,365 --> 00:43:55,432
Good morning, miss Blake.

969
00:43:55,433 --> 00:43:57,067
Thank you for the lovely roses.

970
00:43:57,068 --> 00:43:58,769
I'm so glad you liked them.

971
00:43:58,770 --> 00:44:00,371
Sit down, kid.

972
00:44:01,406 --> 00:44:03,808
Mr. Burley wants to
buy your contract from me.

973
00:44:03,809 --> 00:44:05,776
I told you I wasn't giving up.

974
00:44:05,777 --> 00:44:07,912
You really
think I'm ready
for the tivoli?

975
00:44:07,913 --> 00:44:09,413
Yes, but what's more important,

976
00:44:09,414 --> 00:44:10,647
baldini thinks so.

977
00:44:10,648 --> 00:44:12,283
Oh!

978
00:44:14,319 --> 00:44:16,054
What do you say, kid?

979
00:44:17,522 --> 00:44:20,191
Would you like to
sell my contract,
Mr. Norton?

980
00:44:21,459 --> 00:44:22,761
No.

981
00:44:27,899 --> 00:44:30,200
I'm very sorry.
I can't accept.

982
00:44:30,201 --> 00:44:33,303
Too bad, Burley. I hope
I can do you a favor sometime.

983
00:44:33,304 --> 00:44:34,338
Thanks, Norton.

984
00:44:34,339 --> 00:44:36,140
Would you thank
signor Baldini
for me?

985
00:44:36,141 --> 00:44:37,742
You've both been more than kind.

986
00:44:37,743 --> 00:44:39,710
It's been a pleasure,
and I hope to show you

987
00:44:39,711 --> 00:44:42,112
another side of
San Francisco, if I may.

988
00:44:42,113 --> 00:44:43,247
Thank you.

989
00:44:43,248 --> 00:44:44,681
Good-bye, Norton.

990
00:44:44,682 --> 00:44:46,483
So long.

991
00:44:46,484 --> 00:44:49,186
You wouldn't take 5,000
to tear up that contract,
would you?

992
00:44:49,187 --> 00:44:50,187
Nope.

993
00:44:50,188 --> 00:44:51,156
10,000?

994
00:44:51,157 --> 00:44:53,190
Are you trying to
make an impression?

995
00:44:53,191 --> 00:44:55,292
I said he could have
your contract for nothing

996
00:44:55,293 --> 00:44:57,094
if you wanted to leave.

997
00:44:57,095 --> 00:44:59,964
I'm afraid the tivoli will
have to struggle along, Burley.

998
00:44:59,965 --> 00:45:01,265
Did you do that, Blackie?

999
00:45:01,266 --> 00:45:04,168
Sure. You made
your own choice, kid.

1000
00:45:04,169 --> 00:45:06,737
And I hope you'll never
be sorry, miss Blake.

1001
00:45:06,738 --> 00:45:08,205
Good-bye.

1002
00:45:08,206 --> 00:45:09,440
Good-bye.

1003
00:45:12,110 --> 00:45:14,144
Oh, that was awfully
generous of you--

1004
00:45:14,145 --> 00:45:15,746
about the contract, I mean.

1005
00:45:15,747 --> 00:45:17,281
Oh, forget it.

1006
00:45:17,282 --> 00:45:18,415
Say, look, kid.

1007
00:45:18,416 --> 00:45:20,250
You've heard a lot about
the tivoli opera house

1008
00:45:20,251 --> 00:45:21,986
from mugs that never
get anywhere.

1009
00:45:21,987 --> 00:45:23,553
Now I'm going to tip you off

1010
00:45:23,554 --> 00:45:25,155
to a few facts about
the paradise.

1011
00:45:25,156 --> 00:45:26,257
Come on.

1012
00:45:30,195 --> 00:45:31,395
Ever been here?

1013
00:45:31,396 --> 00:45:32,297
No.

1014
00:45:32,298 --> 00:45:34,064
Well, I don't do
much office work,

1015
00:45:34,065 --> 00:45:36,466
but here's where
I keep my records.

1016
00:45:36,467 --> 00:45:38,302
Take a hinge at those cups.

1017
00:45:38,303 --> 00:45:40,037
Every year,
the wine agents in town,

1018
00:45:40,038 --> 00:45:41,906
Freddie Duane and all the rest,

1019
00:45:41,907 --> 00:45:43,874
pull off an event called
the chicken's ball.

1020
00:45:43,875 --> 00:45:45,075
Ever hear of it?

1021
00:45:45,076 --> 00:45:45,877
No.

1022
00:45:45,878 --> 00:45:47,444
You know what happens there?

1023
00:45:47,445 --> 00:45:50,214
They have a competition
and give a prize
of $10,000 in gold

1024
00:45:50,215 --> 00:45:53,350
to the proprietor
of the joint who puts on
the most artistic show,

1025
00:45:53,351 --> 00:45:55,953
and you know who's won it
three times running?

1026
00:45:55,954 --> 00:45:57,687
The paradise.

1027
00:45:57,688 --> 00:45:58,789
Oh, that's fine.

1028
00:45:58,790 --> 00:46:00,324
For artistic achievement.

1029
00:46:00,325 --> 00:46:02,827
That's what they said
when they slipped me
the trophy.

1030
00:46:02,828 --> 00:46:04,594
Artistic achievement.

1031
00:46:04,595 --> 00:46:06,196
That's wonderful.

1032
00:46:06,197 --> 00:46:08,698
Ain't I telling you?
I'm going to win it
the next time, too,

1033
00:46:08,699 --> 00:46:10,400
and the dough goes
to the campaign fund

1034
00:46:10,401 --> 00:46:12,938
for those little mugs
down here on the coast.

1035
00:46:14,873 --> 00:46:19,911
Hey. You know,
I like to look into
those big lamps of yours.

1036
00:46:24,015 --> 00:46:27,785
If you ever cut this,
I'll put some in my watch.

1037
00:46:29,220 --> 00:46:32,824
I'm crazy about you, kid.
You know it, don't you?

1038
00:46:41,399 --> 00:46:42,867
What's the matter?

1039
00:46:42,868 --> 00:46:43,934
Nothing.

1040
00:46:43,935 --> 00:46:45,903
Well, you look kind of scared.

1041
00:46:45,904 --> 00:46:47,637
I guess maybe I am.

1042
00:46:47,638 --> 00:46:49,173
Of what?

1043
00:46:49,174 --> 00:46:51,876
You.

1044
00:46:51,877 --> 00:46:54,578
Are you sure it's me
you're afraid of?

1045
00:46:54,579 --> 00:46:57,481
Well, what do you think
we should do about it?

1046
00:46:57,482 --> 00:46:58,582
Nothing.

1047
00:46:58,583 --> 00:47:01,251
Nothing? Oh, because you
don't want to, maybe.

1048
00:47:01,252 --> 00:47:04,989
If that's it, don't
be afraid to spill it,
and we'll call it a day.

1049
00:47:04,990 --> 00:47:06,423
Oh, but it isn't right.

1050
00:47:06,424 --> 00:47:07,557
What isn't right?

1051
00:47:07,558 --> 00:47:10,194
For a man and a woman
to be stuck on each other?

1052
00:47:10,195 --> 00:47:12,596
Have you anything
better than that
in Colorado?

1053
00:47:12,597 --> 00:47:16,234
If you have, I'd like
to take a whirl at it.
It must be immense.

1054
00:47:23,841 --> 00:47:27,377
How does it feel
to feel like a woman
and be afraid of it?

1055
00:47:27,378 --> 00:47:28,745
Oh, Blackie, listen.

1056
00:47:28,746 --> 00:47:30,314
If you're going to
preach, please sing.

1057
00:47:30,315 --> 00:47:31,815
That's what I believe in.

1058
00:47:31,816 --> 00:47:33,350
Your voice.
The way you move.

1059
00:47:33,351 --> 00:47:35,920
The way you stand
on those pretty
little feet of yours.

1060
00:47:35,921 --> 00:47:37,454
That's what I believe in.

1061
00:47:37,455 --> 00:47:40,157
Don't you believe
in anything more
than that?

1062
00:47:40,158 --> 00:47:41,691
What more is there?

1063
00:47:41,692 --> 00:47:42,826
God.

1064
00:47:42,827 --> 00:47:44,294
God? Ha ha ha!

1065
00:47:44,295 --> 00:47:46,931
Isn't he supposed to be
taking care of the suckers

1066
00:47:46,932 --> 00:47:48,565
that come down to the missions

1067
00:47:48,566 --> 00:47:49,733
looking for help?

1068
00:47:49,734 --> 00:47:51,701
I've seen them
on their knees
asking for things

1069
00:47:51,702 --> 00:47:53,203
they should stand up
and fight for.

1070
00:47:53,204 --> 00:47:55,672
I don't see god
coming down and giving
them a shortcut.

1071
00:47:55,673 --> 00:47:57,074
That's not what I want.

1072
00:47:57,075 --> 00:47:59,309
I want to push over
the mugs in my way

1073
00:47:59,310 --> 00:48:01,078
before they push me over.

1074
00:48:01,079 --> 00:48:03,713
What I believe in
is not up in the air.

1075
00:48:03,714 --> 00:48:05,749
It's in here and in here.

1076
00:48:05,750 --> 00:48:07,817
But maybe that's not right.

1077
00:48:07,818 --> 00:48:09,987
Maybe it's not right
to feel alive,

1078
00:48:09,988 --> 00:48:12,523
like you and I feel
this minute...

1079
00:48:15,493 --> 00:48:17,594
But I think it's right.

1080
00:48:17,595 --> 00:48:21,365
Mary, I want to
get a kick out of
things I can see,

1081
00:48:21,366 --> 00:48:24,168
like lights on the harbor
or a good fight

1082
00:48:24,169 --> 00:48:25,869
or a woman worth looking at.

1083
00:48:25,870 --> 00:48:30,107
Did you ever taste
a fog in your mouth,
like it was salt,

1084
00:48:30,108 --> 00:48:34,578
or take hold of someone
and feel your blood
rushing like a river?

1085
00:48:34,579 --> 00:48:37,914
What more does a man need,
or a woman, either?

1086
00:48:37,915 --> 00:48:40,350
You know, I never tried
to kid you, Mary.

1087
00:48:40,351 --> 00:48:43,153
You take me as I am,
or you don't take me.

1088
00:48:43,154 --> 00:48:45,755
Tim doesn't try
to change me because
he knows he can't,

1089
00:48:45,756 --> 00:48:47,324
and you can't, either.

1090
00:48:47,325 --> 00:48:48,926
Nothing can.

1091
00:48:50,228 --> 00:48:52,529
You know what
I've been waiting for?

1092
00:48:52,530 --> 00:48:54,864
I've been waiting
to hear you say

1093
00:48:54,865 --> 00:48:57,135
I'm all right with you
the way I am.

1094
00:48:57,935 --> 00:49:00,604
Maybe you're ready
to say it now.

1095
00:49:00,605 --> 00:49:02,273
Are you?

1096
00:49:03,574 --> 00:49:06,276
I don't know.

1097
00:49:06,277 --> 00:49:08,546
Well, it's about time.

1098
00:49:12,417 --> 00:49:14,418
Oh, it's going to
be swell, baby.

1099
00:49:14,419 --> 00:49:16,220
I'll make you
queen of the coast.

1100
00:49:16,221 --> 00:49:17,854
You'll ride
in your own carriage,

1101
00:49:17,855 --> 00:49:19,423
and everybody will know
who you are.

1102
00:49:19,424 --> 00:49:22,526
I'll plaster your
name and face clear
to the golden gate.

1103
00:49:22,527 --> 00:49:25,062
You and I together
are going to find out

1104
00:49:25,063 --> 00:49:27,665
that we don't need
anything else but us.

1105
00:49:32,337 --> 00:49:33,271
Hey, look.

1106
00:49:33,272 --> 00:49:34,871
How about going upstairs

1107
00:49:34,872 --> 00:49:36,873
and having some chop suey, huh?

1108
00:49:36,874 --> 00:49:38,376
Come on.

1109
00:49:46,651 --> 00:49:47,984
[Man]
Watch me

1110
00:49:47,985 --> 00:49:49,419
and keep your mind on my feet.

1111
00:49:49,420 --> 00:49:52,456
Watch this wing.
See? That's it.

1112
00:49:52,457 --> 00:49:54,991
Then you do a sort of a--

1113
00:49:54,992 --> 00:49:55,992
what's the matter?

1114
00:49:55,993 --> 00:49:57,461
Come on, let's--

1115
00:49:57,462 --> 00:49:59,229
that's right, Trixie.
You can knock off.

1116
00:49:59,230 --> 00:50:01,698
Everybody's going to
have champagne on me!

1117
00:50:01,699 --> 00:50:04,634
Dig up some pommery
for the boys and girls.

1118
00:50:04,635 --> 00:50:05,802
All we got is semillon.

1119
00:50:05,803 --> 00:50:08,639
That champagne.
It's enough to
make me dizzy.

1120
00:50:12,777 --> 00:50:15,212
A guy gets killed.

1121
00:50:15,213 --> 00:50:17,181
Can I order you some breakfast?

1122
00:50:17,182 --> 00:50:19,649
No, thanks. Mary and I
will have chop suey upstairs.

1123
00:50:19,650 --> 00:50:22,486
Mary, I have
another new number
I'd like you to try.

1124
00:50:22,487 --> 00:50:24,221
Oh, no, no.
Not this morning.

1125
00:50:24,222 --> 00:50:27,491
Mat! Tell Charlie--
never mind. I'll
tell him myself.

1126
00:50:27,492 --> 00:50:30,227
Stay right here, honey.
I won't be a minute.

1127
00:50:30,228 --> 00:50:33,030
[Girl]
Gee, I haven't had
any champagne since--

1128
00:50:38,536 --> 00:50:42,173
nice going, sister.
You done all right.

1129
00:50:48,979 --> 00:50:50,647
[Humming]

1130
00:50:50,648 --> 00:50:53,583
Knock off, Maggie.
You're going to have
champagne.

1131
00:50:53,584 --> 00:50:54,452
Me, too?

1132
00:50:54,453 --> 00:50:56,019
Well, I'd like to know why not.

1133
00:50:56,020 --> 00:50:59,189
Oh, Mr. Blackie,
I haven't had any
of that for a long time!

1134
00:50:59,190 --> 00:51:01,024
Here's to Blackie!

1135
00:51:01,025 --> 00:51:05,195
Blackie! Blackie!

1136
00:51:05,196 --> 00:51:07,564
Where's Mary?

1137
00:51:07,565 --> 00:51:10,033
Oh, I guess
she went upstairs
to set the table.

1138
00:51:10,034 --> 00:51:11,668
Here's to you, darlin'.

1139
00:51:11,669 --> 00:51:13,103
I wish I had me youth.

1140
00:51:13,104 --> 00:51:15,004
I wish I'd never had mine.

1141
00:51:15,005 --> 00:51:18,542
Why, Trixie.
That's not nice, baby.

1142
00:51:18,543 --> 00:51:22,212
[Man] Tell Mary here's to her!

1143
00:51:22,213 --> 00:51:24,714
Babe, when
that runs out,
open up some more.

1144
00:51:24,715 --> 00:51:25,616
You bet I will.

1145
00:51:25,617 --> 00:51:27,551
Tell Mary
here's to her, Blackie.

1146
00:51:27,552 --> 00:51:29,619
Sure. "Everyone to
his own taste,"

1147
00:51:29,620 --> 00:51:31,755
the old lady said
as she kissed
the cow.

1148
00:51:31,756 --> 00:51:35,493
Ha ha! Ain't that--
what's the matter,
no sense of humor?

1149
00:51:39,630 --> 00:51:40,630
Oh, Blackie!

1150
00:51:40,631 --> 00:51:41,698
Oh, hello, Tim!

1151
00:51:41,699 --> 00:51:43,600
I just came
to talk about
the campaign.

1152
00:51:43,601 --> 00:51:46,770
Oh. Look,
Tim, do you mind
coming back later?

1153
00:51:46,771 --> 00:51:47,771
Sure. Sure.

1154
00:51:47,772 --> 00:51:51,409
Oh, by the way, Blackie,
I just saw Mary.

1155
00:51:52,410 --> 00:51:55,445
Yeah. I put her in a cab.

1156
00:51:55,446 --> 00:51:57,181
She said to tell you good-bye

1157
00:51:57,182 --> 00:51:58,748
and that she was taking you up

1158
00:51:58,749 --> 00:52:01,050
on your offer to let her
out of that contract.

1159
00:52:01,051 --> 00:52:03,653
What? What's that?

1160
00:52:03,654 --> 00:52:06,323
Well, you said she
could go, didn't you?

1161
00:52:06,324 --> 00:52:07,491
Well, yes, but--

1162
00:52:07,492 --> 00:52:09,092
she's gone to the tivoli,

1163
00:52:09,093 --> 00:52:10,560
and I'm glad
you did it, Blackie.

1164
00:52:10,561 --> 00:52:12,796
This was no place for her.

1165
00:52:12,797 --> 00:52:14,664
Oh, you think not, eh?

1166
00:52:14,665 --> 00:52:16,366
Of course not.

1167
00:52:16,367 --> 00:52:18,502
Neither did you, did you?

1168
00:52:18,503 --> 00:52:20,103
You think
she's better off
at the tivoli

1169
00:52:20,104 --> 00:52:22,439
under the management
of Jack Burley, huh?

1170
00:52:22,440 --> 00:52:24,508
She'll be safe
with Burley, Blackie.

1171
00:52:24,509 --> 00:52:28,513
You see, uh...
She doesn't love him.

1172
00:52:31,582 --> 00:52:33,817
Huh!

1173
00:52:33,818 --> 00:52:36,320
Now look, Tim. You like
chop suey, don't you?

1174
00:52:36,321 --> 00:52:37,921
Chop--sure.

1175
00:52:37,922 --> 00:52:39,390
Come upstairs.
We'll have some.

1176
00:52:48,233 --> 00:52:49,566
Good evening, ladies.

1177
00:52:49,567 --> 00:52:52,168
Good evening and get out.

1178
00:52:52,169 --> 00:52:53,370
The child has
a performance to give.

1179
00:52:53,371 --> 00:52:54,871
Oh, no. We've got to thank him.

1180
00:52:54,872 --> 00:52:56,139
Do let him stay.

1181
00:52:56,140 --> 00:52:57,841
Alone, I suppose.

1182
00:52:57,842 --> 00:52:59,209
That's right.

1183
00:52:59,210 --> 00:53:00,510
Come on, Louise.

1184
00:53:00,511 --> 00:53:04,449
In my day, the opera came first.

1185
00:53:06,116 --> 00:53:07,751
My mother's out there
tonight, Mary.

1186
00:53:07,752 --> 00:53:08,752
Is she?

1187
00:53:08,753 --> 00:53:10,487
Yes. She came
all the way from New York.

1188
00:53:10,488 --> 00:53:13,590
I guess she got tired
of reading about you
in my letters.

1189
00:53:13,591 --> 00:53:16,393
Well, in a few hours,
you'll be famous.

1190
00:53:16,394 --> 00:53:19,128
Before the whole town
is at your feet,

1191
00:53:19,129 --> 00:53:20,830
I want to put in my bid.

1192
00:53:20,831 --> 00:53:24,668
I love you, Mary,
and I want you to marry me.

1193
00:53:24,669 --> 00:53:28,204
I've always wanted you,
from the moment I first
set eyes on you,

1194
00:53:28,205 --> 00:53:31,207
but I didn't realize then
howi wanted you.

1195
00:53:31,208 --> 00:53:32,409
Well, I--

1196
00:53:32,410 --> 00:53:34,177
please don't try to
answer me now.

1197
00:53:34,178 --> 00:53:36,714
I just wanted you
to know how I felt.

1198
00:53:38,949 --> 00:53:40,651
Good luck, darling.

1199
00:53:46,557 --> 00:53:47,924
How do you do, Mr. Burley?

1200
00:53:47,925 --> 00:53:48,925
Good evening.

1201
00:53:48,926 --> 00:53:50,159
How do you do?

1202
00:53:50,160 --> 00:53:51,695
Fine, thank you.

1203
00:53:51,696 --> 00:53:52,762
How are you?

1204
00:53:52,763 --> 00:53:54,030
Fine, thanks.

1205
00:53:54,031 --> 00:53:55,333
Thank you.

1206
00:53:56,133 --> 00:53:57,467
I'll be right with you.

1207
00:53:57,468 --> 00:53:59,337
Want to take a look out front.

1208
00:54:00,971 --> 00:54:02,406
Hello there, Mr. Burley.

1209
00:54:02,407 --> 00:54:05,041
Hello there.
Jonathan.

1210
00:54:05,042 --> 00:54:06,910
What a thrilling first night.

1211
00:54:06,911 --> 00:54:08,044
I hope so.

1212
00:54:08,045 --> 00:54:10,847
Mr. Burley, we can't wait
to hear the new star.

1213
00:54:10,848 --> 00:54:11,682
Hello, Jack.

1214
00:54:11,683 --> 00:54:13,617
Have you seen signor Baldini?

1215
00:54:13,618 --> 00:54:14,919
Not yet.

1216
00:54:15,720 --> 00:54:18,822
Hello, Jack.
Big night, eh?

1217
00:54:18,823 --> 00:54:20,657
I hope so, senator.

1218
00:54:20,658 --> 00:54:21,459
Hi.

1219
00:54:21,460 --> 00:54:22,860
Good evening.

1220
00:54:24,862 --> 00:54:26,062
Hello, Norton.

1221
00:54:26,063 --> 00:54:27,063
Good evening.

1222
00:54:27,064 --> 00:54:28,298
Good evening.

1223
00:54:28,299 --> 00:54:29,599
I didn't
know you were
a first-nighter.

1224
00:54:29,600 --> 00:54:31,701
I am tonight.
I came to close you up.

1225
00:54:31,702 --> 00:54:32,802
To what?

1226
00:54:32,803 --> 00:54:34,771
Close you up. You've got
a girl appearing here

1227
00:54:34,772 --> 00:54:36,506
that's under contract to me.

1228
00:54:36,507 --> 00:54:38,742
No, you're wrong.
You abrogated
that contract.

1229
00:54:38,743 --> 00:54:40,610
You gave her
permission to leave.

1230
00:54:40,611 --> 00:54:43,947
I gave her a choice,
and she said she'd stay,

1231
00:54:43,948 --> 00:54:45,649
so the contract stands.

1232
00:54:45,650 --> 00:54:47,884
Look. See that man over there?

1233
00:54:47,885 --> 00:54:50,487
The one with
the big black mustache?

1234
00:54:50,488 --> 00:54:53,523
Well, that big, stupid-looking
man represents the law,

1235
00:54:53,524 --> 00:54:54,824
and he's got a paper

1236
00:54:54,825 --> 00:54:56,560
that's going to stop
your prima Donna

1237
00:54:56,561 --> 00:54:58,362
right in the middle
of her first cantata.

1238
00:54:58,363 --> 00:54:59,629
Isn't that awful?

1239
00:54:59,630 --> 00:55:00,797
You wouldn't do that.

1240
00:55:00,798 --> 00:55:02,198
I'm sorry, Burley,
but I thoughtlessly

1241
00:55:02,199 --> 00:55:04,634
got the man started,
and I can't do a thing with him.

1242
00:55:04,635 --> 00:55:06,102
Well, I guess I'll get my star.

1243
00:55:06,103 --> 00:55:09,573
Wait a minute. She
doesn't go on till
the second act.

1244
00:55:09,574 --> 00:55:11,107
That's not very good
showmanship.

1245
00:55:11,108 --> 00:55:13,042
We'll wait. I don't want
to listen to those others.

1246
00:55:13,043 --> 00:55:15,412
While you're waiting,
would you have a cigar?

1247
00:55:15,413 --> 00:55:16,513
Yeah, thanks.

1248
00:55:16,514 --> 00:55:18,349
Pardon me.
I'll get them.

1249
00:55:19,417 --> 00:55:21,385
Excuse me. I want to
speak to Mr. Baldini.

1250
00:55:21,386 --> 00:55:22,386
Excuse me.

1251
00:55:22,387 --> 00:55:23,854
Sure.

1252
00:55:26,357 --> 00:55:28,092
What is it?

1253
00:55:28,893 --> 00:55:31,995
Hello? Hello, central.
Filmore 2871.

1254
00:55:31,996 --> 00:55:34,864
Norton's outside
with the sheriff
to stop Mary Blake.

1255
00:55:34,865 --> 00:55:35,965
Stop her?

1256
00:55:35,966 --> 00:55:37,100
Yes.

1257
00:55:37,101 --> 00:55:38,035
He can't do that!

1258
00:55:38,036 --> 00:55:39,068
Is Mr. Davis there?

1259
00:55:39,069 --> 00:55:40,236
Maybe he can.

1260
00:55:40,237 --> 00:55:41,805
Oh, hello, Davis?
This is Jack Burley.

1261
00:55:41,806 --> 00:55:44,408
I want you to hurry
over to the opera house

1262
00:55:44,409 --> 00:55:46,710
with a restraining order
to hold up a process.

1263
00:55:46,711 --> 00:55:49,579
I don't care if
the office closed
10 hours ago!

1264
00:55:49,580 --> 00:55:52,783
Find him! But I've
got to have it.

1265
00:55:53,584 --> 00:55:54,951
But what is it?

1266
00:55:54,952 --> 00:55:58,355
You go backstage.
I'll see what I can do.

1267
00:56:02,693 --> 00:56:05,630
[Woman singing opera in french]

1268
00:56:11,469 --> 00:56:13,302
Well, here you are, Norton.

1269
00:56:13,303 --> 00:56:14,337
Oh, thanks.

1270
00:56:14,338 --> 00:56:15,840
Thank you.

1271
00:56:17,842 --> 00:56:19,008
Have a peanut?

1272
00:56:19,009 --> 00:56:20,009
No, thanks.

1273
00:56:20,010 --> 00:56:21,244
Hmm. Cameo here, eh?

1274
00:56:21,245 --> 00:56:24,213
I didn't think
you knew that brand
at the paradise.

1275
00:56:24,214 --> 00:56:25,615
Yeah, that's right.

1276
00:56:25,616 --> 00:56:28,384
You needn't have bothered
to call up Davis, Burley.

1277
00:56:28,385 --> 00:56:29,853
I could have told you his deputy

1278
00:56:29,854 --> 00:56:31,788
was away on a deep-sea
fishing trip.

1279
00:56:31,789 --> 00:56:35,258
He's crazy about fishing,
so I chartered him a boat.

1280
00:56:35,259 --> 00:56:37,761
How about you and I make a deal?

1281
00:56:37,762 --> 00:56:40,196
I'll give you 15,000
for that contract.

1282
00:56:40,197 --> 00:56:41,598
I'd like to oblige you,

1283
00:56:41,599 --> 00:56:43,199
but the thing is
out of my hands.

1284
00:56:43,200 --> 00:56:44,601
That process server

1285
00:56:44,602 --> 00:56:46,603
is the meanest man
west of the Rockies.

1286
00:56:46,604 --> 00:56:48,905
He'd push his mother
off a boat for half a dollar.

1287
00:56:48,906 --> 00:56:51,007
He'd turn the air off
in a baby's Incubator

1288
00:56:51,008 --> 00:56:53,342
just to watch the little
sucker squirm.

1289
00:56:53,343 --> 00:56:54,711
Well, Jim, what do you say?

1290
00:56:54,712 --> 00:56:56,279

understand what I'm
trying to tell you?

1451
01:09:37,374 --> 01:09:39,908
Wait a minute.
I'm making her
queen of the coast.

1452
01:09:39,909 --> 01:09:41,410
You see those posters there?

1453
01:09:41,411 --> 01:09:43,779
5,000 of them
will be plastered
all over San Francisco

1454
01:09:43,780 --> 01:09:47,383
and 10,000 for ashcans
and the front
of trolley cars.

1455
01:09:47,384 --> 01:09:50,219
I'm not going to
let you do this,
Blackie.

1456
01:09:50,220 --> 01:09:53,789
I don't get you, Tim.
You never butted in
on me before.

1457
01:09:53,790 --> 01:09:55,291
Well, I am now.

1458
01:09:55,292 --> 01:09:58,194
You're not going to
exploit this girl.

1459
01:09:59,329 --> 01:10:01,197
Come here, Mary.

1460
01:10:02,932 --> 01:10:04,733
Will you tell his holiness

1461
01:10:04,734 --> 01:10:07,936
that you made up
your own mind
to come back?

1462
01:10:07,937 --> 01:10:10,038
I love him, father.

1463
01:10:10,039 --> 01:10:11,340
That isn't love, Mary.

1464
01:10:11,341 --> 01:10:14,577
Is that so?
Well, it happens
to suit me.

1465
01:10:14,578 --> 01:10:17,513
It isn't love
to let him drag you
down to his level.

1466
01:10:17,514 --> 01:10:21,183
Say, wait a minute, Tim.
I'm going to marry her.

1467
01:10:21,184 --> 01:10:23,419
Not if I can stop you.

1468
01:10:23,420 --> 01:10:25,354
You can't take
a woman in marriage

1469
01:10:25,355 --> 01:10:27,256
and then sell her immortal soul.

1470
01:10:27,257 --> 01:10:30,826
Immortal soul?
Now, look, I don't go
for that kind of talk.

1471
01:10:30,827 --> 01:10:32,761
Don't believe
in that nonsense
and never have!

1472
01:10:32,762 --> 01:10:35,431
You better get back
to the half-wits
that do!

1473
01:10:35,432 --> 01:10:36,832
[Man]
Blake's on next.

1474
01:10:36,833 --> 01:10:38,200
Mary, come with me.

1475
01:10:38,201 --> 01:10:39,702
I'm running this joint.

1476
01:10:39,703 --> 01:10:42,170
You take care
of your suckers.
I'll take care of mine.

1477
01:10:42,171 --> 01:10:43,939
She's not going out there.

1478
01:10:43,940 --> 01:10:46,875
I've listened to your
psalm-singing blather
and never squawked.

1479
01:10:46,876 --> 01:10:49,345
You can't bring it in here.
This is my joint!

1480
01:10:49,346 --> 01:10:51,079
Miss Mary Blake!

1481
01:10:51,080 --> 01:10:52,982
She's not going out there.

1482
01:11:06,162 --> 01:11:08,464
The place is crazy without you.

1483
01:11:08,465 --> 01:11:10,300
Get out there, kid.

1484
01:11:17,073 --> 01:11:19,508
Wait a minute.
You leave now,

1485
01:11:19,509 --> 01:11:21,711
and you're never coming back!

1486
01:11:23,413 --> 01:11:25,881
[Crowd yelling]

1487
01:11:25,882 --> 01:11:27,483
[Pounding]

[Women screaming]

1489
01:11:32,789 --> 01:11:34,790
Hey, Blackie!
Hey, Blackie,
it's Burley!

1490
01:11:34,791 --> 01:11:36,792
He's giving the joint the works!

1491
01:11:36,793 --> 01:11:38,961
You can't buck a guy like that.

1492
01:11:38,962 --> 01:11:40,363
Shut up.

1493
01:11:40,364 --> 01:11:42,799
Look at it. Come on.

1494
01:11:46,536 --> 01:11:48,604
Hey, Blackie!
Blackie, look!

1495
01:11:48,605 --> 01:11:51,640
Look at what
they're doing
to our joint!

1496
01:11:51,641 --> 01:11:53,543
You see what they're doing?

1497
01:12:10,226 --> 01:12:11,727
Is Mrs. Burley in?

1498
01:12:11,728 --> 01:12:12,961
She's in the small cellar.

1499
01:12:12,962 --> 01:12:15,364
What do you think
of our little shack?

1500
01:12:15,365 --> 01:12:16,665
Oh, but it's magnificent.

1501
01:12:16,666 --> 01:12:18,734
We only have one real treasure.

1502
01:12:18,735 --> 01:12:20,537
She's waiting to meet you.

1503
01:12:29,946 --> 01:12:33,549
Ha ha ha!
You needn't
sneak up on me.

1504
01:12:33,550 --> 01:12:35,083
I know you're there.

1505
01:12:35,084 --> 01:12:36,084
[Kiss]

1506
01:12:36,085 --> 01:12:37,353
Mary...

1507
01:12:38,522 --> 01:12:40,088
This is my mother.

1508
01:12:40,089 --> 01:12:41,557
How do you do, my dear?

1509
01:12:41,558 --> 01:12:43,158
How do you do, Mrs. Burley?

1510
01:12:43,159 --> 01:12:44,560
Maisie, have you been

1511
01:12:44,561 --> 01:12:46,562
in the house all day?

1512
01:12:46,563 --> 01:12:48,431
I just got back from the races.

1513
01:12:48,432 --> 01:12:51,567
You're even prettier
close to than you were
from me box at the tivoli.

1514
01:12:51,568 --> 01:12:53,569
Oh, so are you, Mrs. Burley.

1515
01:12:53,570 --> 01:12:55,771
Oh, go on with you.
Get out.

1516
01:12:55,772 --> 01:12:57,172
Get out? Me?

1517
01:12:57,173 --> 01:12:58,607
Certainly you.

1518
01:12:58,608 --> 01:13:00,643
If I have to sell
this amazing,
beautiful creature

1519
01:13:00,644 --> 01:13:02,377
the idea of joining
the Burley family,

1520
01:13:02,378 --> 01:13:05,914
sure, I got to tell
her lies about us
that, heaven help me,

1521
01:13:05,915 --> 01:13:08,050
no son should hear
his mother speak.

1522
01:13:08,051 --> 01:13:10,586
Call me as soon
as you've made
the sale.

1523
01:13:10,587 --> 01:13:11,987
Get out! Get out!

1524
01:13:11,988 --> 01:13:13,989
Sit down, my dear.
Take off your coat.

1525
01:13:13,990 --> 01:13:15,023
Thank you.

1526
01:13:15,024 --> 01:13:19,395
Now tell me,
why won't you marry my boy?

1527
01:13:20,497 --> 01:13:21,930
Mrs. Burley, you belong

1528
01:13:21,931 --> 01:13:24,667
to the aristocracy
of San Francisco.

1529
01:13:24,668 --> 01:13:27,335
I'm just
the daughter
of a country parson.

1530
01:13:27,336 --> 01:13:30,205
I haven't had
the advantage Jack
deserves in a wife.

1531
01:13:30,206 --> 01:13:31,740
Wait a minute, darling.

1532
01:13:31,741 --> 01:13:34,743
I didn't mean
what I said just now
about telling lies.

1533
01:13:34,744 --> 01:13:37,312
We'll speak the truth
to each other.

1534
01:13:37,313 --> 01:13:39,682
I think I know
what it's all about.

1535
01:13:39,683 --> 01:13:41,684
It's that rapscallion
Blackie Norton

1536
01:13:41,685 --> 01:13:43,486
you were working for
down on pacific street.

1537
01:13:43,487 --> 01:13:45,020
Listen, Mary.

1538
01:13:45,021 --> 01:13:48,190
I'm an old lady,
and I've been through
a lot in my life.

1539
01:13:48,191 --> 01:13:51,293
I came to San Francisco
in the winter of '51

1540
01:13:51,294 --> 01:13:53,696
in a sailing vessel
around the horn.

1541
01:13:53,697 --> 01:13:57,733
When I got here,
there were 150 males
to one female,

1542
01:13:57,734 --> 01:13:59,768
and if I do say it--
I shouldn't--

1543
01:13:59,769 --> 01:14:02,170
I wasn't so hard to look at.

1544
01:14:02,171 --> 01:14:04,306
I started business in a shack

1545
01:14:04,307 --> 01:14:06,041
near Portsmouth square
doing washing.

1546
01:14:06,042 --> 01:14:08,276
Do you know how long
me business lasted?

1547
01:14:08,277 --> 01:14:09,712
No.

1548
01:14:09,713 --> 01:14:11,580
About 45 minutes. Ha ha!

1549
01:14:11,581 --> 01:14:13,549
They busted me tub
to smithereens,

1550
01:14:13,550 --> 01:14:15,417
and there was
a free-for-all fight

1551
01:14:15,418 --> 01:14:17,720
between five of
the big swells in the town

1552
01:14:17,721 --> 01:14:20,322
to see which one
would take me to lunch,

1553
01:14:20,323 --> 01:14:22,457
so, you see, I got to know men.

1554
01:14:22,458 --> 01:14:25,861
I knew all kinds
in them early days,

1555
01:14:25,862 --> 01:14:29,699
and among them was a man
like Blackie Norton.

1556
01:14:31,267 --> 01:14:35,771
He was a selfish and sinful...

1557
01:14:35,772 --> 01:14:38,774
And adorable scoundrel.

1558
01:14:38,775 --> 01:14:44,047
So, you see, I've had
my Blackie Norton, too.

1559
01:14:46,382 --> 01:14:48,751
And you gave him up?

1560
01:14:48,752 --> 01:14:52,387
Yes, yes, I--I gave him up

1561
01:14:52,388 --> 01:14:55,825
because he was killing me soul.

1562
01:14:57,994 --> 01:14:59,796
Killing your soul?

1563
01:15:01,330 --> 01:15:03,398
And I pulled myself together,

1564
01:15:03,399 --> 01:15:06,501
and one day, I married Burley.

1565
01:15:06,502 --> 01:15:08,571
Burley was a good, solid man.

1566
01:15:08,572 --> 01:15:11,807
He never got used to
wearing his coat
till the day he died,

1567
01:15:11,808 --> 01:15:14,209
but he built me this mansion,

1568
01:15:14,210 --> 01:15:18,146
and every cuspidor
of the place
was 18-carat gold.

1569
01:15:18,147 --> 01:15:22,284
And there came a time
when I was glad I married him

1570
01:15:22,285 --> 01:15:23,786
because he loved me.

1571
01:15:23,787 --> 01:15:27,623
After a while,
Jack was born,
and I had me peace.

1572
01:15:27,624 --> 01:15:33,028
Look, Mary, you say
we're the aristocracy
of San Francisco.

1573
01:15:33,029 --> 01:15:34,462
We are.

1574
01:15:34,463 --> 01:15:36,031
Listen.

1575
01:15:36,032 --> 01:15:37,701
[People laughing]

1576
01:15:39,035 --> 01:15:40,704
Come here, Mary.

1577
01:15:45,108 --> 01:15:46,809
Listen to that.

1578
01:15:46,810 --> 01:15:49,511
That's the mcdonough mansion--

1579
01:15:49,512 --> 01:15:51,580
aristocrats--

1580
01:15:51,581 --> 01:15:53,515
and that party's been going on

1581
01:15:53,516 --> 01:15:55,951
for two days and nights
straight running.

1582
01:15:55,952 --> 01:15:59,521
There isn't
a rougher joint on
the whole Barbary coast

1583
01:15:59,522 --> 01:16:02,257
than that home
right here on Nob Hill.

1584
01:16:02,258 --> 01:16:04,960
They call this
the wickedest city
in the world,

1585
01:16:04,961 --> 01:16:06,528
and it's a bitter shame, it is,

1586
01:16:06,529 --> 01:16:07,930
for deep down,

1587
01:16:07,931 --> 01:16:10,432
underneath all our evil and sin,

1588
01:16:10,433 --> 01:16:11,800
we've got right here

1589
01:16:11,801 --> 01:16:13,736
the finest set of human beings

1590
01:16:13,737 --> 01:16:16,571
that was ever
rounded up
on one spot.

1591
01:16:16,572 --> 01:16:17,940
Sure, they had to have

1592
01:16:17,941 --> 01:16:19,541
wild adventure in their hearts

1593
01:16:19,542 --> 01:16:20,943
and dynamite in their blood

1594
01:16:20,944 --> 01:16:23,111
to come here in the first place.

1595
01:16:23,112 --> 01:16:24,412
That's why they're

1596
01:16:24,413 --> 01:16:26,481
so full of untamed deviltry now,

1597
01:16:26,482 --> 01:16:28,316
but we can't go on like this--

1598
01:16:28,317 --> 01:16:29,818
sinful and blasphemous,

1599
01:16:29,819 --> 01:16:31,987
with no fear for god
in our hearts.

1600
01:16:31,988 --> 01:16:34,556
That's the reason
why I want my boy

1601
01:16:34,557 --> 01:16:37,092
to have a good woman near him

1602
01:16:37,093 --> 01:16:39,695
and to raise
fine, beautiful kids

1603
01:16:39,696 --> 01:16:41,396
for the glory of our heritage.

01:25:50,112 --> 01:25:53,415
Oh, no. I've got
a few things I want
to tell you, too.

1764
01:25:53,416 --> 01:25:55,417
Now, in case you folks
don't follow me,

1765
01:25:55,418 --> 01:25:57,352
I'll tell you
that this mouse here

1766
01:25:57,353 --> 01:25:59,454
has just had a padlock
put on the paradise

1767
01:25:59,455 --> 01:26:01,223
and thrown all of
Blackie Norton's
performers in jail.

1768
01:26:01,224 --> 01:26:04,259
That's what Blackie got
for picking this phony
up out of the gutter

1769
01:26:04,260 --> 01:26:05,960
and giving her a chance.

1770
01:26:05,961 --> 01:26:07,329
Hold still.

1771
01:26:07,330 --> 01:26:10,965
Don't think
I want to breathe
the air near you

1772
01:26:10,966 --> 01:26:13,368
any longer than I have to.

1773
01:26:13,369 --> 01:26:16,037
You ought to
make that mouse
awfully happy.

1774
01:26:16,038 --> 01:26:17,839
Here's a five-spot, brother.

1775

No. It wasn't any use.

Over to my place.

1814
01:27:42,758 --> 01:27:44,759
Well, I've got to
pack up a few things.

I'll go help you.

No, no, no.
You stay here
and see the show.

You come over later
and tell me who won.

Oh, Blackie,
they say you'll
go up for a year!

1820
01:27:53,702 --> 01:27:55,370
No, no.
I can handle it,

1821
01:27:55,371 --> 01:27:56,904
but I'm worried
about the others.

Gee, Blackie.

the last entry of the evening

1827
01:28:13,722 --> 01:28:15,390
was supposed to have been

1828
01:28:15,391 --> 01:28:17,058
from Mr. Blackie
Norton's paradise.

1829

have failed to
arrive,

close the show
without them.

Hiya, Blackie.

2086
01:47:42,990 --> 01:47:44,725
Hello, mat.

2087
01:47:44,726 --> 01:47:46,560
The cops couldn't hold on to me.

2088
01:47:46,561 --> 01:47:48,394
I got away from them.

2089
01:47:48,395 --> 01:47:50,063
Did you?

2090
01:47:50,064 --> 01:47:51,197
That's great.

2091
01:47:51,198 --> 01:47:55,401
Yeah. It took
an earthquake
to get me.

2092
01:47:55,402 --> 01:47:57,504
How are you making it?

2093
01:47:57,505 --> 01:47:59,774
Oh, I'll
pull through.
I'll be all right.

2094
01:48:01,375 --> 01:48:04,410
Yeah, sure.
Sure, you will.

2095
01:48:04,411 --> 01:48:05,779
Hey, Blackie,

2096
01:48:05,780 --> 01:48:07,514
I hear that Mary went on for you

2097
01:48:07,515 --> 01:48:08,882
at the chicken's ball.

2098
01:48:08,883 --> 01:48:11,652
I was
wrong about her.
She's a great kid.

2099
01:48:11,653 --> 01:48:13,821
She's all right.

2100
01:48:15,489 --> 01:48:17,525
Don't leave him.

2101
01:48:26,568 --> 01:48:28,034
There you are.

Now, you're
going to try to get

2103
01:48:29,904 --> 01:48:31,304
some sleep, aren't you?

2104
01:48:31,305 --> 01:48:32,539
[Girl] Yes.

2105
01:48:32,540 --> 01:48:35,108
With your eyes open?

2106
01:48:35,109 --> 01:48:36,744
That's right.

2107
01:48:44,518 --> 01:48:46,921
Hello, Blackie.

2108
01:49:02,136 --> 01:49:03,905
Thanks, Tim.

2109
01:49:07,942 --> 01:49:10,043
That map
of yours needs
some attention.

2110
01:49:10,044 --> 01:49:10,978
Come on.

2111
01:49:10,979 --> 01:49:12,614
No, no, no.
I'm all right.

2112
01:49:14,582 --> 01:49:16,918
You haven't found
Mary yet, have you?

2113
01:49:19,420 --> 01:49:20,855
No.

2114
01:49:21,989 --> 01:49:23,556
Well, you can't want her

2115
01:49:23,557 --> 01:49:25,091
for the paradise, Blackie.

2116
01:49:25,092 --> 01:49:26,560
That's gone.

2117
01:49:27,995 --> 01:49:31,098
I wasn't thinking
of the paradise, Tim.

2118
01:49:32,566 --> 01:49:35,069
Wait a minute.

2119
01:49:39,006 --> 01:49:41,574
Come on, mug.
I'm going to
take you to Mary.

2120
01:49:41,575 --> 01:49:44,210
You--
is she all right?

2121
01:49:44,211 --> 01:49:45,947
Yeah, she's all right.

2122
01:49:55,489 --> 01:49:57,223
You folks will have
to be vaccinated.

2123

It's for your own good.
