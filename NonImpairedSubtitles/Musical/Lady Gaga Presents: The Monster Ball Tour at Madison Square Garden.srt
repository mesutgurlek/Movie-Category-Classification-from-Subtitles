1
00:00:40,673 --> 00:00:42,470
Can I have a coffee, please...

2
00:00:42,675 --> 00:00:44,438
...with milk and Splenda?

3
00:00:44,644 --> 00:00:47,408
- Sure. What size?
- Large.

4
00:00:52,619 --> 00:00:54,211
Here you go.

5
00:01:09,335 --> 00:01:11,064
Can you believe
I'm playing the Garden?

6
00:01:11,271 --> 00:01:12,795
Are we ready? Thanks, man.

7
00:01:56,616 --> 00:01:57,878
Look at that.

8
00:01:58,084 --> 00:01:59,176
Sold out.

9
00:02:04,023 --> 00:02:06,583
Looks like Lady Gaga.

10
00:02:06,793 --> 00:02:08,920
Oh, my God.

11
00:02:09,129 --> 00:02:12,121
- Oh, my God. It is.
- Hey.

12
00:02:12,332 --> 00:02:14,562
- Hello, Lady Gaga.
- I can't believe it's you.

13
00:02:14,767 --> 00:02:17,292
- Hey, nice to meet you.
- Oh, my God. Oh, my God.

14
00:02:17,504 --> 00:02:19,165
I love you.

15
00:02:22,609 --> 00:02:24,543
Lady Gaga!

16
00:02:25,378 --> 00:02:28,370
Do you know how many times
I came to this arena?

17
00:02:28,681 --> 00:02:32,378
And now they're opening
these gates up for us.

18
00:02:52,238 --> 00:02:56,197
Welcome, HBO, to the Monster Ball.

19
00:03:03,349 --> 00:03:05,146
I don't know. I get, like, so...

20
00:03:05,351 --> 00:03:10,448
I just get so revved up when I do
these benchmark shows, you know?

21
00:03:10,657 --> 00:03:11,817
Yeah.

22
00:03:12,025 --> 00:03:15,256
I just don't want my fans to ever feel...

23
00:03:22,335 --> 00:03:26,328
I just sometimes feel like a loser still,
you know?

24
00:03:28,508 --> 00:03:31,102
I know it's crazy because it's like,
we're at the Garden.

25
00:03:31,311 --> 00:03:35,475
But I still sometimes feel
like a fucking loser kid in high school.

26
00:03:38,451 --> 00:03:39,543
I'm sorry.

27
00:03:39,752 --> 00:03:41,151
Don't be sorry.

28
00:03:41,354 --> 00:03:43,618
I just want to be a queen for them,
you know...

29
00:03:43,823 --> 00:03:45,814
...and sometimes I don't feel like one.

30
00:03:49,395 --> 00:03:52,796
I'm gonna marry the night

31
00:03:52,999 --> 00:03:57,299
I won't give up on my life

32
00:03:57,503 --> 00:03:59,903
I'm a warrior queen

33
00:04:00,106 --> 00:04:03,542
Live passionately tonight

34
00:04:45,652 --> 00:04:49,315
Run, run
Her kiss is a vampire grin

35
00:04:49,522 --> 00:04:51,956
Vampire grin
Vampire grin

36
00:04:53,526 --> 00:04:57,462
The moon lights her way
While she's howlin' at him

37
00:04:57,664 --> 00:04:59,598
Howlin' at him, howlin' at him

38
00:05:01,501 --> 00:05:02,525
She looks good

39
00:05:02,735 --> 00:05:05,329
But her boyfriend says
She's a tramp

40
00:05:05,538 --> 00:05:07,267
She's a tramp
She's a vamp

41
00:05:07,473 --> 00:05:09,407
But she still does her dance

42
00:05:09,609 --> 00:05:11,372
She's a tramp
She's a vamp

43
00:05:11,577 --> 00:05:13,909
But she still kills the dance

44
00:05:16,149 --> 00:05:19,312
Baby loves to dance in the dark

45
00:05:19,519 --> 00:05:23,455
'Cause when he's lookin'
She falls apart

46
00:05:23,656 --> 00:05:26,716
Baby loves to dance in the dark

47
00:05:26,926 --> 00:05:28,791
Dark, dark

48
00:05:31,764 --> 00:05:35,256
Baby loves to dance in the dark

49
00:05:35,468 --> 00:05:39,768
'Cause when he's lookin'
She falls apart

50
00:05:39,972 --> 00:05:42,964
Baby loves to dance
The dance in the dark

51
00:05:43,176 --> 00:05:45,167
In the dark

52
00:05:47,213 --> 00:05:50,046
Girls, are y'all getting ready?

53
00:05:50,249 --> 00:05:52,945
- Pepper?
- Yeah, Posh, I'm getting ready.

54
00:05:53,152 --> 00:05:55,518
Hey, Bang-Bang,
are you getting ready?

55
00:05:55,722 --> 00:05:57,314
Of course I'm getting ready.

56
00:05:57,523 --> 00:05:59,150
Hey, Champagne,
you getting ready, girl?

57
00:05:59,359 --> 00:06:00,621
I'm already ready.

58
00:06:00,827 --> 00:06:02,522
Well, let's hit it, honey.

59
00:06:02,729 --> 00:06:07,666
Marilyn, Judy, Sylvia

60
00:06:08,301 --> 00:06:10,201
Tell 'em how you feel, girls

61
00:06:10,403 --> 00:06:13,702
Work your blond Benet Ramsey
We'll haunt like Liberace

62
00:06:13,906 --> 00:06:15,737
Find your freedom in the music

63
00:06:15,942 --> 00:06:17,807
Find your Jesus
Find your Kubrick

64
00:06:18,010 --> 00:06:19,602
You will never fall apart

65
00:06:19,812 --> 00:06:21,609
Diana, you're still in our hearts

66
00:06:21,814 --> 00:06:23,509
Never let you fall apart

67
00:06:23,716 --> 00:06:25,206
Together we'll dance in the dark

68
00:06:25,418 --> 00:06:28,410
Baby loves to dance in the dark

69
00:06:28,621 --> 00:06:32,819
'Cause when he's lookin'
She falls apart

70
00:06:33,025 --> 00:06:37,724
Baby loves to dance in the dark

71
00:06:37,930 --> 00:06:41,058
Baby

72
00:06:41,267 --> 00:06:44,668
Baby loves to dance in the dark

73
00:06:44,871 --> 00:06:48,398
'Cause when he's lookin'
She falls apart

74
00:06:49,041 --> 00:06:52,738
Baby loves to dance
The dance in the dark

75
00:06:55,348 --> 00:06:56,337
In the dark

76
00:06:56,549 --> 00:06:58,380
In the dark, in the dark

77
00:07:03,055 --> 00:07:06,456
- Oh, no.
- Posh, are we breaking down?

78
00:07:07,794 --> 00:07:10,092
Oh, just give me a second.

79
00:07:10,296 --> 00:07:12,025
Where's Gaga, anyway?

80
00:07:12,231 --> 00:07:14,131
- And where's my lipstick?
- Shut up.

81
00:07:14,333 --> 00:07:17,029
Now we're never gonna
make it to the Monster Ball.

82
00:07:18,771 --> 00:07:22,434
Yes, you will. I'll take you there.

83
00:07:22,642 --> 00:07:25,509
Rub that glitter
And grease around

84
00:07:25,711 --> 00:07:27,941
Rub that glitter and grease around

85
00:07:28,147 --> 00:07:31,708
Rub that glitter and grease around
Grease around

Rub that glitter and grease around
Grease around

89
00:07:41,127 --> 00:07:42,788
Punch it

90
00:07:42,995 --> 00:07:45,395
In Brooklyn

91
00:07:45,598 --> 00:07:48,726
Painted green watermelon

92
00:07:50,136 --> 00:07:53,765
- That guy's ride
- His ride

93
00:07:53,973 --> 00:07:55,998
Is good-lookin'

94
00:07:56,209 --> 00:07:58,939
Good-lookin'

95
00:07:59,145 --> 00:08:00,942
He tells me

96
00:08:01,147 --> 00:08:03,240
That he loves me

97
00:08:03,449 --> 00:08:06,816
And even though I'm real sexy

98
00:08:07,019 --> 00:08:11,285
He loves his car, car, car

99
00:08:11,491 --> 00:08:15,723
He's always with his car, car, car

100
00:08:15,928 --> 00:08:17,156
So I

101
00:08:17,363 --> 00:08:19,991
Rub that glitter and grease around

102
00:08:20,199 --> 00:08:22,167
Rub that glitter and grease around

103
00:08:22,368 --> 00:08:26,168
Rub that glitter and grease around
Grease around

104
00:08:26,372 --> 00:08:29,068
Rub that glitter and grease around

105
00:08:29,275 --> 00:08:31,266
Rub that glitter and grease around

106

Rub that glitter and grease around
Grease around

107
00:08:35,448 --> 00:08:37,507
Knock it, pump it, wash it, bump it

108
00:08:37,717 --> 00:08:39,617
Rub that glitter and grease
He loves it

109
00:08:39,819 --> 00:08:41,844
He's so fine
He makes her shiny

110
00:08:42,054 --> 00:08:44,249
There's more glitter and grease
Behind you

111
00:08:44,457 --> 00:08:46,982
Rub that glitter and grease around

112
00:08:47,193 --> 00:08:49,423
Rub that glitter and grease around

113
00:08:49,629 --> 00:08:53,360

Rub that glitter and grease around
Grease around

00:09:40,112 --> 00:09:43,013
Gaga! Gaga! Gaga!

118
00:10:41,340 --> 00:10:46,505
Red wine, Konvict, Ga ga

119
00:10:50,216 --> 00:10:54,209
I've had a little too much, much

120
00:10:54,420 --> 00:10:57,787
- All of the people start to rush
- Start to rush by

121
00:10:57,990 --> 00:11:00,015
How does he twist the dance?

122
00:11:00,226 --> 00:11:01,716
Can't find my drink, or man

123
00:11:01,927 --> 00:11:04,691
Where are my keys?
I lost my phone

124
00:11:06,599 --> 00:11:10,365
What's goin' on on the floor?

125
00:11:10,569 --> 00:11:14,505
I love this record, baby
But I can't see straight anymore

126
00:11:14,707 --> 00:11:18,040
Keep it cool
What's the name of this club?

127
00:11:18,244 --> 00:11:21,042
I can't remember
But it's all right, all right

128
00:11:21,247 --> 00:11:22,680
- Now jump

New York City!

136
00:11:40,666 --> 00:11:42,964
Wish I could shut my playboy mouth

137
00:11:43,169 --> 00:11:44,329
Oh, oh, oh-oh

138
00:11:44,537 --> 00:11:48,473
- How'd I turn my shirt inside out?
- Inside out right

139
00:11:48,674 --> 00:11:52,576
Control your poison, babe
Roses have thorns they say

140
00:11:52,778 --> 00:11:55,178
And were all gettin' hosed tonight

141

Oh, oh, oh-oh

Come on.

163

...what's the Monster Ball
really, really all about?

226
00:16:32,424 --> 00:16:33,823
Well...

227
00:16:34,526 --> 00:16:36,221
...Victor...

228
00:16:37,596 --> 00:16:39,996
...the Monster Ball...

229
00:16:40,199 --> 00:16:43,930
...will set you free, New York!

230
00:16:47,840 --> 00:16:51,207
You mean "I can be...

231
00:16:51,410 --> 00:16:56,643
...whoever or whatever...

232
00:16:56,849 --> 00:17:00,546
...that I want to be" free?

233
00:17:01,153 --> 00:17:04,611
Yeah, Victor, tonight...

234
00:17:04,823 --> 00:17:06,984
...in the town that gave birth to me...

235
00:17:07,192 --> 00:17:09,490
...we're gonna be...

236
00:17:09,695 --> 00:17:12,493
...super free little monsters!

237
00:17:18,737 --> 00:17:21,001
And the best thing
about the Monster Ball...

238
00:17:21,206 --> 00:17:23,003
...is that I created it...

239
00:17:23,208 --> 00:17:25,802
...so that my fans
would have a place to go.

240
00:17:26,678 --> 00:17:28,236
A place where...

241
00:17:29,348 --> 00:17:32,613
...all the freaks are outside...

242
00:17:33,385 --> 00:17:36,946
...and I lock the fucking doors!

243
00:17:38,724 --> 00:17:41,591
It doesn't matter who you are
or where you come from...

244
00:17:41,794 --> 00:17:44,354
...or how much money
you've got in your pocket...

245
00:17:44,563 --> 00:17:47,361
...because tonight
and every night after...

246
00:17:47,566 --> 00:17:50,660
...you can be whoever it is
that you wanna be...

247
00:17:50,869 --> 00:17:53,565
...New York City!

248
00:17:57,076 --> 00:17:59,374
And to get to the Monster Ball...

249
00:17:59,578 --> 00:18:03,036
...to find that inner sense...

250
00:18:03,248 --> 00:18:05,148
...of fame...

251
00:18:06,251 --> 00:18:09,880
...all you've got to do is follow...

252
00:18:11,690 --> 00:18:14,056
Yes, super fans.

253
00:18:14,259 --> 00:18:16,454
- The glitter way.

254
00:18:47,693 --> 00:18:49,923
Do you love me?

255
00:18:50,129 --> 00:18:53,621
Because I love you, New York.

256
00:18:53,832 --> 00:18:57,859
So come on, little monsters.
Take my picture.

257
00:18:58,070 --> 00:19:01,403
I wanna be a New York City star.

258
00:19:03,075 --> 00:19:06,511
Come on, you better sing along.
You know the words.

259
00:19:06,712 --> 00:19:08,976
You got the fame.

260
00:19:09,181 --> 00:19:12,878
I can't help myself

261
00:19:13,085 --> 00:19:16,077
I'm addicted to a life of material

262
00:19:16,555 --> 00:19:20,787
It's some kind of joke

263
00:19:20,993 --> 00:19:24,087
I'm obsessively opposed to the typical

264
00:19:24,296 --> 00:19:28,198
All we care about is

265
00:19:28,400 --> 00:19:31,733
Runway models, Cadillacs
And liquor bottles

266
00:19:31,937 --> 00:19:36,874
Give me something, I wanna be
Retro glamour

267
00:19:37,075 --> 00:19:38,940
Now put your hands up with me
like this:

268
00:19:39,144 --> 00:19:42,011
Fame, doin' it for the fame

269
00:19:42,214 --> 00:19:44,614
'Cause we wanna live the life
Of the rich and famous

270
00:19:44,816 --> 00:19:46,374
That's right, New York, hands up.

271
00:19:46,585 --> 00:19:49,452
Fame, doin' it for the fame

272
00:19:49,655 --> 00:19:54,354
'Cause we got a taste for champagne
And endless fortune

273
00:19:55,327 --> 00:19:57,295
Come on, Jesus.

274
00:19:57,496 --> 00:19:59,896
Come a little closer.

275
00:20:00,098 --> 00:20:01,963
Give me some of that challenge.

276
00:20:02,434 --> 00:20:05,164
You're the most famous man
in the world.

277
00:20:05,370 --> 00:20:09,636
Give it up for a real superstar,
Jesus Christ!

278
00:20:24,756 --> 00:20:30,092
I can see myself in the movies

279
00:20:30,295 --> 00:20:32,058
With my picture in the city lights

280
00:20:32,264 --> 00:20:35,995
Photograph my mouth

281
00:20:36,201 --> 00:20:39,364
And whatever else you'd like to shoot
You decide

282
00:20:39,571 --> 00:20:43,837
All we care about is

283
00:20:44,042 --> 00:20:47,478
Pornographic
Girls on film and body plastic

284
00:20:47,679 --> 00:20:51,615
Give me something
I wanna see

00:20:53,652 --> 00:20:54,676
Come on, let's go.

287
00:20:54,886 --> 00:20:57,480
Fame, doin' it for the fame

288
00:20:57,689 --> 00:20:59,088
'Cause we wanna live

289
00:20:59,291 --> 00:21:02,124
Put your hands up with me like this:

290
00:21:02,327 --> 00:21:05,057
Fame, doin' it for the fame

291
00:21:05,264 --> 00:21:09,792
'Cause we got a taste for champagne
And endless fortune

292
00:21:10,002 --> 00:21:11,629
Fame, fame, baby

293
00:21:11,837 --> 00:21:16,206
You don't need to have money
or plastic surgery...

294
00:21:18,143 --> 00:21:20,008
...to be a New York City star.

295
00:21:20,212 --> 00:21:22,612
In it for the fame, fame, baby

296
00:21:22,814 --> 00:21:24,406
The fame, fame

297

- Don't ask me how or why
- Or why

298
00:21:28,654 --> 00:21:31,953
But I'm gonna make it happen this time

299
00:21:32,157 --> 00:21:35,684
- My teenage dream tonight
- Tonight

300
00:21:35,894 --> 00:21:39,386

Please watch your step.

303
00:22:44,863 --> 00:22:47,593
Next stop: Glitter Way.

304
00:22:58,810 --> 00:23:02,211
He can't read my poker face

305
00:23:04,416 --> 00:23:05,610
Emergency.

306
00:23:05,817 --> 00:23:08,081
There's something in the tracks.

307
00:23:45,724 --> 00:23:48,454
I wanna kiss you

308
00:23:49,494 --> 00:23:53,328
But if I do then I might miss you, babe

309
00:23:55,300 --> 00:23:57,666
It's complicated and stupid

310
00:23:57,869 --> 00:23:59,860
Got my ass squeezed by sexy Cupid

311
00:24:00,071 --> 00:24:02,505
Guess he wants to play, wants to play

312
00:24:02,707 --> 00:24:05,107
A love game, a love game

313
00:24:05,310 --> 00:24:07,107
Hold me and love me

314

Just wanna touch you for a minute

315

Baby, three seconds isn't enough
For my heart to quit it

316
00:24:14,553 --> 00:24:16,316
Let's have some fun, this beat is sick

317
00:24:16,521 --> 00:24:18,648
I wanna take a ride on your disco stick

00:24:18,857 --> 00:24:21,087
Don't think too much, just bust that kick

00:24:35,841 --> 00:24:37,365
Are you in the game?

327
00:24:38,810 --> 00:24:41,370
Doin' the love game

328
00:24:49,721 --> 00:24:52,747
I'm on a mission

329
00:24:52,958 --> 00:24:56,758
And it involves some heavy touching
Yeah

330
00:24:56,962 --> 00:24:59,089
Oh, yeah

331
00:24:59,297 --> 00:25:01,492
You've indicated your interest

332
00:25:01,700 --> 00:25:03,861
I'm educated in sex, yes

333
00:25:04,069 --> 00:25:06,503
Now I want it bad, want it bad

334
00:25:06,705 --> 00:25:08,730
A love game, a love game

335
00:25:08,940 --> 00:25:10,965
Hold me and love me

336
00:25:11,176 --> 00:25:13,974
Just wanna touch you for a minute

337
00:25:14,179 --> 00:25:16,545
Baby, three seconds isn't enough
For my heart to quit it

338
00:25:16,748 --> 00:25:18,340
Put your hands up.

339
00:25:18,550 --> 00:25:20,177
Let's have some fun, this beat is sick

340
00:25:20,385 --> 00:25:22,250
Hands up.

341
00:25:22,454 --> 00:25:24,285
We've only got
one more night together...

342
00:25:24,489 --> 00:25:27,356
...Madison Square Garden,
so you better dance!

343
00:25:27,559 --> 00:25:29,424
Let's play a love game
Play a love game

344
00:25:29,628 --> 00:25:31,186
Do you want love or you want fame?

345
00:25:31,396 --> 00:25:33,626
Are you in the game?

346
00:25:33,832 --> 00:25:35,823
Doin' the love game

347
00:25:36,034 --> 00:25:38,002
Let's play a love game
Play a love game

348
00:25:38,203 --> 00:25:39,761
Do you want love or you want fame?

349
00:25:39,971 --> 00:25:41,438
Are you in the game?

350
00:25:43,008 --> 00:25:45,636
Doin' the love game

351
00:25:45,844 --> 00:25:51,646
I can see you staring there
From across the block

352
00:25:51,850 --> 00:25:54,944
With a smile on your mouth
And your hand on your...

353
00:25:55,153 --> 00:26:00,785
The story of us
It always starts the same

354
00:26:00,992 --> 00:26:03,893
With a boy and a girl and a...
And a game

355
00:26:04,095 --> 00:26:05,084
Scream.

356
00:26:05,297 --> 00:26:06,286
A game

357
00:26:06,498 --> 00:26:07,624
Louder.

358
00:26:07,832 --> 00:26:09,891
A game

359
00:26:10,101 --> 00:26:13,264
A game, a love game

360
00:26:13,471 --> 00:26:15,098
Come on, let's go.

361
00:26:15,307 --> 00:26:17,468
Let's play a love game
Play a love game

362
00:26:17,676 --> 00:26:19,234
Do you want love or you want fame?

363
00:26:19,444 --> 00:26:21,469
Are you in the game?

364
00:26:21,680 --> 00:26:23,443
Doin' the love game

365
00:26:23,648 --> 00:26:25,548
Let's play a love game
Play a love game

366
00:26:25,750 --> 00:26:27,479
Do you want love or you want fame?

367
00:26:27,686 --> 00:26:29,244
Are you in the game?

368
00:26:30,755 --> 00:26:33,815
Doin' the love game

369
00:26:34,025 --> 00:26:40,555
Let's, let's, let's

370
00:26:40,865 --> 00:26:42,730
Let's have some fun, this beat is sick

371
00:26:42,934 --> 00:26:43,923
I wanna take a ride

372
00:26:44,135 --> 00:26:45,898
Let's go.

373
00:26:46,104 --> 00:26:48,334
Let's, let's, let's

374
00:26:48,540 --> 00:26:49,529
Let's have some fun

375
00:26:49,741 --> 00:26:50,765
Okay, New York.

376
00:26:50,976 --> 00:26:52,841
I wanna take a ride on your disco stick

377
00:26:53,044 --> 00:26:55,808
Are you all standing up?

378
00:26:57,549 --> 00:26:59,176
I don't know if you've heard...

379
00:27:00,185 --> 00:27:02,983
...but I have a pretty tremendous dick.

380
00:27:03,188 --> 00:27:05,486
So come on...

381
00:27:05,690 --> 00:27:06,987
Disco, disco, disco

382
00:27:07,192 --> 00:27:09,490
...get your dicks out.

383
00:27:11,630 --> 00:27:18,399
Because I know they've got some
pretty big cock here in New York City.

384
00:27:18,603 --> 00:27:20,127
Welcome to the Monster Ball.

385
00:27:20,338 --> 00:27:22,363
Now dance, you motherfuckers!

386
00:27:49,567 --> 00:27:52,900
Put your paws up. Now jump.

387
00:28:17,562 --> 00:28:19,189
My...

388
00:28:20,331 --> 00:28:21,923
...name...

389
00:28:23,568 --> 00:28:24,865
...is...

390
00:28:26,671 --> 00:28:28,798
...Lady Gaga!

391
00:28:34,913 --> 00:28:36,813
And welcome...

392
00:28:38,316 --> 00:28:40,216
...to the last...

393
00:28:40,418 --> 00:28:42,545
...of five shows...

394
00:28:42,754 --> 00:28:46,019
...at Madison Square Garden.

395
00:28:52,964 --> 00:28:54,989
I feel so blessed.

396
00:28:55,200 --> 00:28:56,758
You have no idea.

397
00:28:56,968 --> 00:28:59,766
I grew up 2O blocks from here...

398
00:28:59,971 --> 00:29:04,533
...and I watched every name
go up on that marquee...

399
00:29:04,743 --> 00:29:07,337
...year after year, month after month.

400
00:29:07,545 --> 00:29:12,107
And I used to dream that one day
I'd see my name in lights.

401
00:29:17,322 --> 00:29:19,017
So thank you so much.

402
00:29:19,657 --> 00:29:23,149
Thank you for buying a ticket
to see my show.

403
00:29:29,567 --> 00:29:31,694
And for those of you who didn't pay
for your tickets...

404
00:29:31,903 --> 00:29:34,098
...I want my money back.

405
00:29:35,673 --> 00:29:37,698
I'm just kidding.

406
00:29:41,279 --> 00:29:44,476
You know, I didn't used to be brave.

407
00:29:44,983 --> 00:29:48,419
In fact, I wasn't very brave at all.

408
00:29:49,320 --> 00:29:53,757
But you have made me brave,
little monsters.

409
00:29:57,662 --> 00:30:01,598
And New York made me brave.

410
00:30:03,802 --> 00:30:05,497
So now...

411
00:30:06,337 --> 00:30:08,965
...l'm gonna be brave for you.

412
00:30:10,942 --> 00:30:14,673
Tonight I want you to forget
all of your insecurities.

413
00:30:14,879 --> 00:30:17,609
I want you to reject anyone or anything...

414
00:30:17,816 --> 00:30:21,513
...that's ever made you feel like
you don't belong or don't fit in.

415
00:30:21,719 --> 00:30:23,653
Or made you feel like
you're not good enough...

416
00:30:23,855 --> 00:30:25,482
...or pretty enough, or thin enough.

417
00:30:25,690 --> 00:30:27,783
Or can't sing well enough,
or dance well enough...

418
00:30:27,992 --> 00:30:29,459
...or write a song well enough.

419
00:30:29,661 --> 00:30:31,526
Or like you'll never win a Grammy.

420
00:30:31,729 --> 00:30:34,789
Or you'll never sell out
Madison Square Garden!

421
00:30:34,999 --> 00:30:39,493
You just remember
that you're a goddamn superstar!

422
00:30:39,704 --> 00:30:42,195
And you were born this way!

423
00:30:48,947 --> 00:30:53,475
May tonight be your liberation
of all those things.

424
00:30:53,685 --> 00:30:56,017
Because I used to pick up
my leather boots...

425
00:30:56,221 --> 00:30:58,018
...on that street...

426
00:30:58,223 --> 00:31:02,023
...and I would go down the stairs...

427
00:31:02,227 --> 00:31:04,422
...to the 9 Train.

428
00:31:04,629 --> 00:31:06,756
And I'd take the 9 Train downtown.

429
00:31:06,965 --> 00:31:11,493
And then I'd get on the L Train
to go across town.

430
00:31:12,437 --> 00:31:13,927
And I'd go to dance class.

431
00:31:14,138 --> 00:31:15,935
And I would pray, and I would dream...

432
00:31:16,140 --> 00:31:20,634
...that someday,
one person would believe in me.

433
00:31:24,849 --> 00:31:27,181
So when you leave here tonight...

434
00:31:27,385 --> 00:31:32,379
...know that at least one person
believes in you.

435
00:31:37,262 --> 00:31:39,662
Hello, purple unicorn.

436
00:31:39,864 --> 00:31:43,265
That is the most fabulous gay unicorn
that I have ever seen.

437
00:31:45,503 --> 00:31:49,633
He has a rainbow horn. He's purple.

438
00:31:49,841 --> 00:31:53,470
He has neon hooves.
That's very exciting.

439
00:31:53,678 --> 00:31:56,408
The only thing better than a unicorn
is a gay unicorn.

440
00:31:58,917 --> 00:32:01,477
Oh, you know what that means.

441
00:32:01,686 --> 00:32:06,453
All the New York gays
Came out to play

442
00:32:09,193 --> 00:32:12,185
And some came from New Jersey

443
00:32:15,099 --> 00:32:17,897
But we don't care
'Cause it's all the same

444
00:32:18,102 --> 00:32:20,593
And we were born this way

445
00:32:22,707 --> 00:32:25,835
Yeah!

446
00:32:27,745 --> 00:32:29,838
I don't know what I'm gonna do
with all of you.

447
00:32:30,048 --> 00:32:32,915
You see, I told my friends
about the Monster Ball.

448
00:32:33,117 --> 00:32:36,177
I told them that the Monster Ball
would set them free.

449
00:32:36,387 --> 00:32:38,355
So we got into my car...

450
00:32:38,556 --> 00:32:41,616
...but my car broke down in Brooklyn.

451
00:32:45,063 --> 00:32:47,930
So then we got onto the subway...

452
00:32:48,132 --> 00:32:49,497
...onto the F Train...

453
00:32:49,701 --> 00:32:52,602
...which always gets me
where I need to go.

454
00:32:54,005 --> 00:32:57,634
But the subway's left us off
in this very strange place.

455
00:32:58,543 --> 00:33:02,673
And I just have no fucking clue
where we are.

456
00:33:03,948 --> 00:33:07,281
You think I should ask
my friends for some help?

457
00:33:08,152 --> 00:33:11,121
You know, my deepest
and most loyal friends?

458
00:33:11,556 --> 00:33:13,183
You know...

459
00:33:13,391 --> 00:33:17,589
...all my New York
and tristate-area gays?

460
00:33:20,331 --> 00:33:23,323
This one's for the boys
and the girls tonight.

461
00:33:23,968 --> 00:33:26,232
Celebrate your gay pride.

462
00:33:28,239 --> 00:33:31,538
Hey there, sugar baby
Saw you twice at the pop show

463
00:33:31,743 --> 00:33:35,975
You taste just like glitter
Mixed with rock 'n' roll

464
00:33:36,180 --> 00:33:39,547
I like you a lot, lot
Think you're really hot, hot

465
00:33:39,751 --> 00:33:43,517
I know you think you're special
When we dance real crazy

466
00:33:43,721 --> 00:33:47,179
Glamaphonic, electronic, disco, baby

467
00:33:47,392 --> 00:33:51,226
I like you a lot, lot
All we want is hot, hot

468
00:33:51,429 --> 00:33:52,418
Now jump.

469
00:33:52,630 --> 00:33:56,396
Boys, boys, boys
We like boys in cars

470
00:33:56,601 --> 00:34:00,128
Boys, boys, boys
Buy us drinks in bars

471
00:34:00,338 --> 00:34:04,001
Boys, boys, boys
With hairspray and denim

472
00:34:04,208 --> 00:34:08,076
Boys, boys, boys
We love them, we love them

473
00:34:08,279 --> 00:34:12,773
Now, I don't care if you're gay, straight,
bi, transgender, transsexual...

474
00:34:12,984 --> 00:34:14,417
...put your hands up.

475
00:34:16,821 --> 00:34:20,279
Baby is a bad boy
With some retro sneakers

476
00:34:20,491 --> 00:34:24,325
Let's see Lady Starlight
And make out in the bleachers

477
00:34:24,529 --> 00:34:28,363
I like you a lot, lot
Think you're really hot, hot

478
00:34:28,566 --> 00:34:32,332
Let's go to the party
Heard our buddy's the DJ

479
00:34:32,537 --> 00:34:36,200
Don't forget my lipstick
I left it in your ashtray

480
00:34:36,407 --> 00:34:39,535
I like you a lot, lot
All we want is hot, hot

481
00:34:39,744 --> 00:34:40,802
Now jump.

482
00:34:41,012 --> 00:34:44,880
Boys, boys, boys
We like boys in cars

483
00:34:45,083 --> 00:34:48,883
Boys, boys, boys
Buy us drinks in bars

484
00:34:49,087 --> 00:34:52,545
Boys, boys, boys
With hairspray and denim

485
00:34:52,757 --> 00:34:56,818
Boys, boys, boys
We love them, we love them

486
00:34:57,028 --> 00:35:00,486
Boys, boys, boys
We like boys in cars

487
00:35:00,698 --> 00:35:04,327
Boys, boys, boys
Buy us drinks in bars

488
00:35:04,535 --> 00:35:08,301
Boys, boys, boys
With hairspray and denim

489
00:35:08,506 --> 00:35:12,806
Boys, boys, boys
We love them, we love them

490
00:35:13,010 --> 00:35:17,003
I'm not loose, I like to party
Let's get lost in your Ferrari

491
00:35:17,215 --> 00:35:21,015
Not psychotic or dramatic
I like boys and that is that

492
00:35:21,219 --> 00:35:23,016
Love it when you call me legs

493
00:35:23,221 --> 00:35:24,882
In the morning buy me eggs

494
00:35:25,089 --> 00:35:26,784
Watch your heart when we're together

495
00:35:26,991 --> 00:35:28,959
Boys like you love me forever

496
00:35:29,160 --> 00:35:32,721
Oh, oh, oh, oh

497
00:35:32,930 --> 00:35:36,593
Oh, oh, oh, oh

498
00:35:36,801 --> 00:35:40,328
Oh, oh, oh, oh

499
00:35:40,538 --> 00:35:43,598
Oh, oh, oh, oh

500
00:35:43,808 --> 00:35:45,605
Boys, boys, boys

501
00:35:47,645 --> 00:35:49,510
Boys, boys, boys

502
00:35:51,349 --> 00:35:53,317
Boys, boys, boys

503
00:35:55,486 --> 00:35:59,320
Boys, boys, boys
We love them, we love them

504
00:35:59,524 --> 00:36:02,755
Boys, boys, boys
We like boys in cars

505
00:36:02,960 --> 00:36:06,828
Boys, boys, boys
Buy us drinks in bars

506
00:36:07,031 --> 00:36:10,592
Boys, boys, boys
With hairspray and denim

507
00:36:10,801 --> 00:36:15,329
Boys, boys, boys
We love them, we love them

508
00:36:38,429 --> 00:36:43,128
Does anybody know
what I really, really hate?

509
00:36:48,439 --> 00:36:51,636
I hate money.

510
00:36:54,679 --> 00:36:59,013
It's hot as hell in here, New York.

511
00:37:01,319 --> 00:37:07,451
But nobody can ever make me
take off my leather.

512
00:37:12,997 --> 00:37:15,522
I'm just a bad kid.

513
00:37:55,906 --> 00:37:58,602
I don't want your money.

514
00:37:58,809 --> 00:38:01,107
I want your soul, honey.

515
00:38:02,913 --> 00:38:07,111
Damn, I love the Jag
The jet and the mansion

516
00:38:07,318 --> 00:38:09,650
Sing it
Oh, yeah

517
00:38:10,821 --> 00:38:15,849
And I enjoy the gifts
And trips to the islands

518
00:38:16,060 --> 00:38:18,290
Oh, yeah

519
00:38:18,496 --> 00:38:22,091
It's good to live expensive
You know it

520
00:38:22,300 --> 00:38:25,098
But my knees get weak
Intensive

521
00:38:25,303 --> 00:38:26,565
Hands up.

522
00:38:26,771 --> 00:38:29,262
When you give me kisses
That's money, honey

523
00:38:29,473 --> 00:38:33,307
When I'm your lover and your mistress
That's money, honey

524
00:38:33,511 --> 00:38:37,413
When you touch me, it's so delicious
That's money, honey

525
00:38:37,615 --> 00:38:42,018
Baby, when you tear me to pieces
That's money, honey

526
00:38:44,388 --> 00:38:49,382
Kisses
That's M-O-N-E-Y

527
00:38:49,593 --> 00:38:51,584
So sexy, I

528
00:39:05,710 --> 00:39:07,439
How are you doing tonight?

529
00:39:12,450 --> 00:39:17,319
This is so crazy for me,
just completely psycho.

530
00:39:17,521 --> 00:39:22,584
I used to sit usually in the bleachers,
you know, in the back.

531
00:39:23,861 --> 00:39:28,798
And I would sit with my mom, you know,
who would take me to see shows.

532
00:39:28,999 --> 00:39:33,060
And I'd watch some other bitch
sing and dance on the stage all night...

533
00:39:33,270 --> 00:39:35,135
...that I wanted to be.

534
00:39:37,208 --> 00:39:40,644
And I would say,
"I wish I was that bitch on that stage."

535
00:39:43,314 --> 00:39:45,407
So just so you know...

536
00:39:45,616 --> 00:39:48,608
...someday you'll be up here
instead of me...

537
00:39:48,819 --> 00:39:51,811
...and I'll be sitting in the back
cheering all you guys on.

538
00:39:57,361 --> 00:39:59,158
Hello?

539
00:39:59,363 --> 00:40:00,990
Beyoncé?

540
00:40:04,568 --> 00:40:08,561
She's always interrupting
the middle of my show.

541
00:40:10,674 --> 00:40:14,337
Hello, hello, baby, you called?
I can't hear a thing

542
00:40:14,545 --> 00:40:18,504
I have got no service
In the club, you see, you see

543
00:40:18,716 --> 00:40:22,379
What did you say, huh?
You're breakin' up on me

544
00:40:22,586 --> 00:40:26,147
Sorry, I cannot hear you
I'm kind of busy

545
00:40:26,357 --> 00:40:30,487
Kind of busy, kind of busy

546
00:40:30,694 --> 00:40:34,323
Sorry, I cannot hear you
I'm kind of busy

547
00:40:34,532 --> 00:40:37,968
Just a second
It's my favorite song they're gonna play

548
00:40:38,169 --> 00:40:41,866
And I cannot text you
With a drink in my hand, yeah

549
00:40:42,072 --> 00:40:45,667
You should've made some plans with me
You knew that I was free

550
00:40:45,876 --> 00:40:48,902
And now you won't stop calling me
I'm kind of busy

551
00:40:49,113 --> 00:40:50,102
Come on.

552
00:40:50,314 --> 00:40:54,341
Stop callin', stop callin'
I don't wanna think anymore

553
00:40:54,552 --> 00:40:57,919
I left my head and my heart
On the dance floor

554
00:40:58,122 --> 00:41:02,081
Stop callin', stop callin'
I don't wanna talk anymore

555
00:41:02,293 --> 00:41:05,888
I left my head and my heart
On the dance floor

556
00:41:06,096 --> 00:41:08,792
Eh, eh, eh, eh, eh, eh, eh

557
00:41:08,999 --> 00:41:10,091
Stop telephoning me

558
00:41:10,301 --> 00:41:12,428
Eh, eh, eh, eh, eh, eh, eh

559
00:41:12,903 --> 00:41:14,097
I'm busy

560
00:41:14,305 --> 00:41:16,432
Eh, eh, eh, eh, eh, eh, eh

561
00:41:16,640 --> 00:41:18,130
Stop telephoning me

562
00:41:18,342 --> 00:41:20,902
Eh, eh, eh, eh, eh, eh, eh

563
00:41:21,111 --> 00:41:23,136
Can call all you want
But there's no one home

564
00:41:23,347 --> 00:41:24,974
And you're not gonna reach
My telephone

565
00:41:25,182 --> 00:41:27,548
'Cause I'm in the club
And I'm sippin' that bub

566
00:41:27,751 --> 00:41:29,480
And you're not gonna
Reach my telephone

567
00:41:29,687 --> 00:41:31,382
Can call all you want
But there's no one home

568
00:41:31,589 --> 00:41:33,216
And you're not gonna reach
My telephone

569
00:41:33,424 --> 00:41:35,187
Out in the club
And I'm sippin' that bub

570
00:41:35,392 --> 00:41:37,223
And you're not gonna reach
My telephone

571
00:41:37,428 --> 00:41:39,828
Come on, sing Beyoncé's part.

572
00:41:40,030 --> 00:41:43,056
Won't make me leave no faster
Put my coat on faster

573
00:41:43,267 --> 00:41:44,757
Leave my girls no faster

574
00:41:44,969 --> 00:41:49,099
I should have left my phone at home
'Cause this is a disaster

575
00:41:49,306 --> 00:41:53,208
Calling like a collector
Sorry, I cannot answer

576
00:41:53,410 --> 00:41:56,811
Not that I don't like you
I'm just at a party

577
00:41:57,014 --> 00:42:00,677
And I am sick and tired
Of my phone ringin'

578
00:42:00,885 --> 00:42:02,546
I like your jacket.

579
00:42:02,753 --> 00:42:04,345
- In Grand Central Station

580
00:42:04,555 --> 00:42:08,616
Put your cell phones away.
And put your hands up.

581
00:42:08,826 --> 00:42:11,294
Because this is only gonna happen once.

582
00:42:11,495 --> 00:42:14,225
Free your mind and your spirit.

583
00:42:14,431 --> 00:42:16,729
We were born this way.

584
00:42:16,934 --> 00:42:20,802
Stop callin', stop callin'
I don't wanna think anymore

585
00:42:21,005 --> 00:42:24,065
I left my head and my heart
On the dance floor

586
00:42:24,275 --> 00:42:28,769
Stop callin', stop callin'
I don't wanna talk anymore

587
00:42:28,979 --> 00:42:32,176
I left my head and my heart
On the dance floor

588
00:42:32,383 --> 00:42:36,581
Stop callin', stop callin'
I don't wanna think anymore

589
00:42:36,787 --> 00:42:40,052
I left my head and my heart
On the dance floor

590
00:42:40,257 --> 00:42:44,421
Stop callin', stop callin'
I don't wanna talk anymore

591
00:42:44,628 --> 00:42:48,189
I left my head and my heart
On the dance floor

592
00:42:48,399 --> 00:42:50,697
- Eh, eh, eh, eh, eh, eh, eh
- Stop telephoning me

593
00:42:50,901 --> 00:42:52,425
Stop telephoning me

594
00:42:52,636 --> 00:42:55,070
- Eh, eh, eh, eh, eh, eh, eh
- I'm kind of busy

595
00:42:55,272 --> 00:42:56,933
I'm busy

596
00:42:57,141 --> 00:42:58,631
All right, put your hands up.

597
00:42:58,842 --> 00:43:00,366
Stop telephoning me

598
00:43:00,578 --> 00:43:03,342
Now, let's break the floors, New York.

599
00:43:03,547 --> 00:43:05,674
Can call all you want
But there's no one home

600
00:43:05,883 --> 00:43:07,441
You're not gonna reach
My telephone

601
00:43:07,651 --> 00:43:09,619
'Cause I'm out in the club
And I'm sippin' that bub

602
00:43:09,820 --> 00:43:11,788
You're not gonna reach
My telephone

603
00:43:11,989 --> 00:43:13,820
Call all you want
But there's no one home

604
00:43:14,024 --> 00:43:15,685
You're not gonna reach
My telephone

605
00:43:15,893 --> 00:43:17,884
'Cause I'm out in the club
And I'm sippin' that bub

606
00:43:18,095 --> 00:43:20,461
And you're not gonna reach
My telephone

607
00:43:20,664 --> 00:43:23,360
My telephone, my telephone

608
00:43:23,567 --> 00:43:25,626
'Cause I'm out in the club
And I'm sippin' that bub

609
00:43:25,836 --> 00:43:28,236
And you're not gonna reach
My telephone

610
00:43:28,439 --> 00:43:30,703
My telephone, my telephone

611
00:43:30,908 --> 00:43:33,376
'Cause I'm out in the club
And I'm sippin' that bub

612
00:43:33,577 --> 00:43:35,636
And you're not gonna reach
My telephone

613
00:45:10,974 --> 00:45:15,741
I just want to say thank you
to all of you for being here tonight...

614
00:45:15,946 --> 00:45:20,440
...because HBO is filming
for our HBO special.

615
00:45:24,988 --> 00:45:28,651
And it's just this really amazing night
for all of us.

616
00:45:28,859 --> 00:45:31,885
And I'm so happy.
I can't even begin to tell you...

617
00:45:32,096 --> 00:45:34,291
...how grateful I am
that you're all here.

618
00:45:34,498 --> 00:45:36,295
And it's really funny...

619
00:45:36,500 --> 00:45:39,060
...because my favorite thing
about the Monster Ball...

620
00:45:39,269 --> 00:45:41,134
...is that everybody gets really drunk...

621
00:45:41,338 --> 00:45:44,136
...and vomits on each other
and has a good time.

622
00:45:46,009 --> 00:45:47,670
So you don't know this...

623
00:45:47,878 --> 00:45:50,938
...but in between the sets
when the videos are playing...

624
00:45:51,148 --> 00:45:53,582
...I can actually see you
from backstage.

625
00:45:53,784 --> 00:45:58,687
And I see everybody running
to go get drinks really quickly.

626
00:46:02,159 --> 00:46:05,219
I'm always laughing because I think,
"These drunk assholes.

627
00:46:05,429 --> 00:46:08,887
That's all they wanna do,
is drink and have a good time."

628
00:46:09,967 --> 00:46:14,995
So in light of watching all of you
have a good time...

629
00:46:15,205 --> 00:46:21,474
...I would like to dedicate this song
to all the drunk assholes in my life.

630
00:46:26,450 --> 00:46:28,509
This is called "Speechless."

631
00:46:45,102 --> 00:46:48,560
Oh, I

632
00:46:49,573 --> 00:46:53,873
I can't believe what you said to me

633
00:46:54,077 --> 00:46:58,173
Last night we were alone

634
00:46:58,382 --> 00:47:01,647
You threw your hands up

635
00:47:02,186 --> 00:47:07,419
Baby, you gave up, you gave up

636
00:47:07,624 --> 00:47:11,924
I can't believe how you looked at me

637
00:47:12,129 --> 00:47:15,656
With your James Dean glossy eyes

638
00:47:15,866 --> 00:47:21,463
Oh, in your tight jeans with your long hair

639
00:47:21,672 --> 00:47:28,635
And your cigarette-stained lies

640
00:47:29,479 --> 00:47:36,442
Could we fix you if you broke?

641
00:47:38,422 --> 00:47:45,385
Was your punch line just a joke?

642
00:47:47,197 --> 00:47:51,361
I'll never talk again

643
00:47:51,568 --> 00:47:55,971
Oh, boy, you've left me speechless

644
00:47:57,708 --> 00:48:04,307
You've left me speechless
So speechless

645
00:48:04,514 --> 00:48:08,974
And I'll never love again

646
00:48:09,186 --> 00:48:14,920
Oh, friends, you've left me speechless

647
00:48:15,125 --> 00:48:21,826
You've left me speechless
So speechless

648
00:48:22,032 --> 00:48:24,159
And my make...

649
00:48:24,368 --> 00:48:29,738
Every night, this fucking makeup falls off
right at that same lyric.

650
00:48:29,940 --> 00:48:32,500
Shit.

651
00:48:33,243 --> 00:48:34,642
And on another note...

652
00:48:34,845 --> 00:48:41,478
...not to blow up too many people's spots
tonight, but Liza Minnelli is here.

653
00:48:45,155 --> 00:48:47,453
I thought you all might want to stand up
for her...

654
00:48:47,658 --> 00:48:50,058
...because, you know, it is Liza.

655
00:48:58,135 --> 00:49:01,969
And Marisa Tomei is here tonight.

656
00:49:03,340 --> 00:49:07,276
And I usually would never tell you guys
who's here tonight...

657
00:49:07,477 --> 00:49:09,308
...but the reason I'm telling you...

658
00:49:09,513 --> 00:49:12,346
...is because these two women
influenced me so much...

659
00:49:12,549 --> 00:49:14,380
...when I was in theater school.

660
00:49:14,584 --> 00:49:17,610
Because I went to Tisch,
you know, at NYU.

661
00:49:21,124 --> 00:49:25,220
And what used to happen was
the teachers would go:

662
00:49:26,330 --> 00:49:31,393
"Well, your voice is too pop.

663
00:49:32,903 --> 00:49:38,500
And when you sing pop music,
your voice is too theater.

664
00:49:41,578 --> 00:49:43,569
And, you know...

665
00:49:43,780 --> 00:49:45,748
...you're never gonna play the heroine.

666
00:49:45,949 --> 00:49:49,077
And you're never gonna play
the blond, you know.

667
00:49:49,286 --> 00:49:52,847
You're never gonna play the ingénue.

668
00:49:53,056 --> 00:49:54,683
You'll never be the main character.

669
00:49:54,891 --> 00:49:57,257
You're never gonna be the star.

670
00:49:57,461 --> 00:50:02,489
Because you have dark hair
and you're too ethnic."

671
00:50:11,541 --> 00:50:14,942
So I used to say:

672
00:50:15,412 --> 00:50:17,607
"Well, what about Liza?"

673
00:50:21,151 --> 00:50:23,449
And then I'd get to acting class...

674
00:50:23,653 --> 00:50:26,747
...and they'd always pull out
a script for me...

675
00:50:26,957 --> 00:50:30,120
...that Marisa had played in a movie...

676
00:50:30,861 --> 00:50:33,591
And they'd say,
"You'll play these kinds of...

677
00:50:33,797 --> 00:50:36,027
These kinds of really
ballsy women roles."

678
00:50:36,233 --> 00:50:38,929
And you know what?
There's never a role other than that...

679
00:50:39,136 --> 00:50:40,728
...that I'm ever gonna wanna play.

680
00:50:40,937 --> 00:50:44,532
So thank you, Marisa,
for always playing that role for us.

681
00:50:46,143 --> 00:50:49,476
After all the drinks

682
00:50:49,679 --> 00:50:53,945
And the bars that we've been to

683
00:50:54,151 --> 00:50:56,551
Would you give it all up?

684
00:50:56,753 --> 00:51:00,348
Could I give it all up for you?

685
00:51:03,894 --> 00:51:10,857
After all the boys and the girls
That we've been through

686
00:51:11,601 --> 00:51:13,831
Would you give it all up?

687
00:51:14,037 --> 00:51:18,235
I've never given up

688
00:51:18,442 --> 00:51:24,278
If I promise, boy, to you

689
00:51:27,918 --> 00:51:33,754
Well, I'll never talk again, no

690
00:51:36,726 --> 00:51:42,631
Oh, I'll never love again

691
00:51:44,101 --> 00:51:48,333
Oh, I'll never write a song

692
00:51:48,538 --> 00:51:52,201
Won't even sing along

693
00:51:52,409 --> 00:51:56,004
Why you so speechless?

694
00:51:56,213 --> 00:51:58,977
Speechless

695
00:52:00,183 --> 00:52:07,146
Speechless

696
00:52:11,628 --> 00:52:14,153
So thank you for giving me...

697
00:52:14,364 --> 00:52:17,527
...two bad bitches to look up to.

698
00:52:22,272 --> 00:52:26,800
So speechless, baby

699
00:52:45,428 --> 00:52:48,522
All right, you wanna hear a new one?

700
00:52:51,401 --> 00:52:54,996
This is from my new album,
Born This Way.

701
00:52:57,407 --> 00:52:59,773
This is called "Yoü and I."

702
00:53:00,911 --> 00:53:05,143
It's been a long time
Since I came around

703
00:53:05,348 --> 00:53:09,375
Been a long time
But I'm back in town

704
00:53:09,586 --> 00:53:15,491
And this time
I'm not leaving without you

705
00:53:17,794 --> 00:53:21,560
You taste like whiskey
When you kiss me, oh

706
00:53:21,765 --> 00:53:26,202
I'd give anything again
To be your baby doll

707
00:53:26,403 --> 00:53:31,568
This time
I'm not leaving without you

708
00:53:34,110 --> 00:53:38,342
He says sit back down
Where you belong

709
00:53:38,548 --> 00:53:42,211
In the corner of my bar
With your high heels on

710
00:53:42,852 --> 00:53:48,085
Sit back down on the couch
Where we made love the first time

711
00:53:48,291 --> 00:53:51,055
And you said to me

712
00:53:51,261 --> 00:53:55,391
Something, something about
This place

713
00:53:58,635 --> 00:54:04,801
Something about lonely nights
And my lipstick on your face

714
00:54:06,343 --> 00:54:12,339
Something, something about
My cool Nebraska guy

715
00:54:12,549 --> 00:54:17,782
Yeah, something about, baby, you and I

716
00:54:20,590 --> 00:54:23,923
It's been two years
Since I let you go

717
00:54:24,127 --> 00:54:27,893
Couldn't listen to a joke
Or rock 'n' roll

718
00:54:28,098 --> 00:54:33,263
Muscle cars drove a truck
Right through my heart

719
00:54:35,071 --> 00:54:39,098
On my birthday you sang me
"A Heart of Gold"

720
00:54:39,309 --> 00:54:43,109
With the guitar humming
In overload

721
00:54:43,313 --> 00:54:48,046
This time I'm not leaving
Without you

722
00:54:48,251 --> 00:54:50,617
Oh, oh

723
00:54:50,820 --> 00:54:53,880
Sit back down
Where you belong

724
00:54:54,090 --> 00:54:58,083
In the corner of a bar
With your high heels on

725
00:54:58,295 --> 00:55:03,255
Sit back down on the couch
Where we made love the first time

726
00:55:03,466 --> 00:55:05,229
And you said to me

727
00:55:05,435 --> 00:55:10,805
There's something
Something about this place

728
00:55:13,443 --> 00:55:19,814
Something about lonely nights
And my lipstick on your face

729
00:55:21,551 --> 00:55:27,183
Something, something about
My cool Nebraska guy

730
00:55:27,824 --> 00:55:32,761
Yeah, something about
New York, you and I

731
00:55:32,962 --> 00:55:34,759
Put your hands up.

732
00:55:34,964 --> 00:55:36,932
You and I

733
00:55:38,601 --> 00:55:40,762
You, you and I

734
00:55:42,272 --> 00:55:44,365
You, you and I

735
00:55:45,875 --> 00:55:50,005
You, you and I

736
00:55:50,213 --> 00:55:51,737
You and I

737
00:55:53,650 --> 00:55:56,084
You, you and I

738
00:55:56,286 --> 00:55:57,844
New York City!

739
00:55:58,054 --> 00:56:00,386
I'd rather die

740
00:56:01,057 --> 00:56:03,457
Without you and I

741
00:56:03,660 --> 00:56:05,491
Come on!

742
00:56:18,508 --> 00:56:22,968
I'm gonna still play this piano
with my long-ass New York nails.

743
00:57:09,492 --> 00:57:12,290
There's something

744
00:57:12,495 --> 00:57:15,589
Something about

745
00:57:15,799 --> 00:57:18,290
This place

746
00:57:22,405 --> 00:57:25,374
Something about

747
00:57:25,575 --> 00:57:28,442
New York nights

748
00:57:30,046 --> 00:57:36,679
And the lipstick
On little monsters' faces

749
00:57:39,889 --> 00:57:42,255
Something

750
00:57:42,459 --> 00:57:44,654
Something about

751
00:57:44,861 --> 00:57:51,824
My cool New York guy

752
00:57:55,138 --> 00:57:58,835
Yeah, something about

753
00:57:59,075 --> 00:58:02,135
Manhattan

754
00:58:04,481 --> 00:58:07,041
Brooklyn

755
00:58:07,951 --> 00:58:10,112
Queens

756
00:58:10,987 --> 00:58:13,421
The Bronx

757
00:58:13,923 --> 00:58:15,413
Staten Island

758
00:58:15,625 --> 00:58:19,459
The Palisades, Long Island

759
00:58:20,363 --> 00:58:23,730
You and I

760
00:58:25,602 --> 00:58:29,436
You, you and I

761
00:58:29,639 --> 00:58:34,736
New York City, I'd rather die

762
00:58:35,612 --> 00:58:41,141
Without you and I

763
00:58:41,351 --> 00:58:43,148
You and I

764
00:58:45,355 --> 00:58:47,880
You, you and I

765
00:58:49,292 --> 00:58:51,283
I miss your hot dogs

766
00:58:51,494 --> 00:58:54,554
I miss the subway
I miss the people

767
00:58:54,764 --> 00:58:57,028
I miss everything about you, goddamn it

768
00:58:57,901 --> 00:59:00,062
You and I

769
00:59:01,170 --> 00:59:03,638
You, you and I

770
00:59:04,941 --> 00:59:06,909
You, you and I

771
00:59:08,811 --> 00:59:10,711
You, you and I

772
00:59:10,914 --> 00:59:12,779
Put your hands up.

773
00:59:12,982 --> 00:59:14,950
You and I

774
00:59:15,151 --> 00:59:19,178
New York, New York
New York, New York

775
00:59:19,389 --> 00:59:20,583
New York

776
00:59:20,790 --> 00:59:22,815
I'd rather die

777
00:59:24,160 --> 00:59:27,618
Without you and I

778
00:59:30,633 --> 00:59:36,401
It's been a long time
Since I came around

779
00:59:36,606 --> 00:59:42,772
Been a long time
But I'm back in town

780
00:59:43,613 --> 00:59:45,581
And this time

781
00:59:45,782 --> 00:59:50,185
I'm not leaving

782
00:59:51,154 --> 00:59:57,559
Without

783
00:59:57,760 --> 01:00:01,025
You

784
01:00:03,032 --> 01:00:04,932
Oh!

785
01:00:35,898 --> 01:00:41,427
And so as my friends and I traveled...

786
01:00:41,638 --> 01:00:44,971
...further and further
down the Glitter Way...

787
01:00:45,174 --> 01:00:50,111
...we ran into a magical angel
with a beautiful black harp.

788
01:00:50,313 --> 01:00:54,613
And she said that she knew
just the music to play...

789
01:00:54,817 --> 01:00:59,686
...to get us closer and closer
to the Monster Ball...

790
01:00:59,889 --> 01:01:02,915
...at Madison Square Garden.

791
01:01:09,532 --> 01:01:11,591
Oh, what's that thing?

792
01:01:12,335 --> 01:01:14,496
What's that thing?

793
01:01:15,638 --> 01:01:17,902
Way up in the sky?

794
01:01:18,741 --> 01:01:20,800
It's very beautiful
but very strange.

795
01:01:21,010 --> 01:01:23,604
Is that a rainbow?

796
01:01:23,813 --> 01:01:27,510
No, it can't be.

797
01:01:29,952 --> 01:01:34,048
Little monsters, it's a twister.

798
01:02:53,369 --> 01:02:55,303
Monsters...

799
01:02:55,505 --> 01:02:58,906
...you make me so happy I could die.

800
01:03:02,478 --> 01:03:07,040
Eh-eh, eh-eh
Ye-ha, ye-ha

801
01:03:07,250 --> 01:03:12,153
Eh-eh, eh-eh
Aha, aha

802
01:03:12,355 --> 01:03:16,985
Eh-eh, eh-eh
Ye-ha, ye-ha

803
01:03:17,193 --> 01:03:21,789
Eh-eh, eh-eh
Aha, aha

804
01:03:21,998 --> 01:03:25,729
I love that lavender blond

805
01:03:25,935 --> 01:03:28,836
The way she moves
The way she walks

806
01:03:29,038 --> 01:03:31,598
I touch myself, can't get enough

807
01:03:31,808 --> 01:03:35,244
And in the silence of the night

808
01:03:35,444 --> 01:03:38,242
Through all the tears
And all the lies

809
01:03:38,447 --> 01:03:40,813
I touch myself and it's all right

810
01:03:41,017 --> 01:03:45,579
Just give in

811
01:03:45,955 --> 01:03:48,116
Don't give up, baby

812
01:03:48,324 --> 01:03:50,451
Open up your heart
And your mind to me

813
01:03:50,660 --> 01:03:52,287
- Just
- Just

814
01:03:52,495 --> 01:03:54,986
- Know when
- Know when

815
01:03:55,631 --> 01:03:57,223
That glass is empty

816
01:03:57,433 --> 01:03:59,924
That the world is gonna bend, yeah

817
01:04:00,136 --> 01:04:02,229
Happy in the club
With a bottle of red wine

818
01:04:02,438 --> 01:04:04,804
Stars in our eyes
'Cause we're having a good time

819
01:04:05,007 --> 01:04:06,531
Eh-eh, eh-eh

820
01:04:07,009 --> 01:04:09,603
So happy I could die

821
01:04:09,812 --> 01:04:12,042
Be your best friend
Yeah, I'll love you forever

822
01:04:12,248 --> 01:04:14,409
Up in the clouds
We'll be higher than ever

823
01:04:14,617 --> 01:04:16,209
Eh-eh, eh-eh

824
01:04:16,419 --> 01:04:19,445
So happy I could die
And it's all right

825
01:04:26,329 --> 01:04:30,288
So happy I could die
And it's all right

826
01:04:42,612 --> 01:04:44,477
I like your "Born This Way" jackets.

827
01:04:44,680 --> 01:04:47,080
Those are very nice.

828
01:04:47,283 --> 01:04:50,616
I can see you all from up here
at the same time.

829
01:04:51,320 --> 01:04:53,345
Put your hands up.

830
01:04:54,290 --> 01:04:57,726
Let's all enjoy this moment together.
Bounce with me.

831
01:04:57,927 --> 01:05:00,054
Happy in the club
With a bottle of red wine

832
01:05:00,263 --> 01:05:02,493
Stars in our eyes
'Cause we're having a good time

833
01:05:02,698 --> 01:05:04,529
Eh-eh, eh-eh

834
01:05:04,734 --> 01:05:06,565
So happy I could die

835
01:05:07,370 --> 01:05:09,304
Be your best friend
Yeah, I'll love you forever

836
01:05:09,505 --> 01:05:12,030
Up in the clouds
We'll be higher than ever

837
01:05:12,241 --> 01:05:14,106
Eh-eh, eh-eh

838
01:05:14,310 --> 01:05:17,507
So happy I could die
And it's all right

839
01:05:23,953 --> 01:05:27,286
So happy I could die
And it's all right

840
01:05:33,329 --> 01:05:36,025
So happy I could die
And it's all right

841
01:05:36,232 --> 01:05:38,166
Happy in the club
With a bottle of red wine

842
01:05:38,367 --> 01:05:40,892
Stars in our eyes
'Cause we're having a good time

843
01:05:41,103 --> 01:05:42,798
Eh-eh, eh-eh

844
01:05:43,005 --> 01:05:45,667
So happy I could die

845
01:05:45,875 --> 01:05:48,070
Be your best friend
Yeah, I'll love you forever

846
01:05:48,277 --> 01:05:50,472
Up in the clouds
We'll be higher than ever

847
01:05:50,680 --> 01:05:52,545
Eh-eh, eh-eh

848
01:05:52,748 --> 01:05:55,717
So happy I could die
And it's all right

849
01:05:59,355 --> 01:06:01,016
Oh, no...

850
01:06:01,223 --> 01:06:03,316
...the twister.

851
01:06:03,526 --> 01:06:08,361
It's left my friends and I off
in a very strange place.

852
01:06:08,564 --> 01:06:14,127
A deep, dark and evil place.

853
01:06:15,104 --> 01:06:18,972
In the deepest, darkest part...

854
01:06:19,642 --> 01:06:21,872
...of Central Park.

855
01:06:22,078 --> 01:06:23,875
Put your paws up.

856
01:06:26,082 --> 01:06:27,379
Yeah

857
01:06:28,684 --> 01:06:31,244
Dancing, yeah

858
01:06:33,889 --> 01:06:35,652
Yeah

859
01:06:36,659 --> 01:06:37,819
Dancing

860
01:06:38,027 --> 01:06:39,995
Put your paws up.

861
01:06:42,031 --> 01:06:43,328
Yeah

862
01:06:44,433 --> 01:06:45,559
Dancing

863
01:06:45,768 --> 01:06:47,360
Put your paws up.

864
01:07:12,061 --> 01:07:14,029
Don't call me GaGa

865
01:07:16,265 --> 01:07:17,755
Don't call me GaGa

866
01:07:25,608 --> 01:07:27,633
Don't call me GaGa

867
01:07:29,211 --> 01:07:32,271
I've never seen one like that before

868
01:07:35,484 --> 01:07:37,816
Don't look at me like that

869
01:07:38,788 --> 01:07:39,812
You amaze me

870
01:07:40,022 --> 01:07:42,650
He ate my heart
He ate my heart

871
01:07:42,858 --> 01:07:43,847
You little monster

872
01:07:44,060 --> 01:07:46,460
He ate my heart
He ate my heart out

873
01:07:46,662 --> 01:07:47,856
You amaze me

874
01:07:48,064 --> 01:07:51,727
He ate my heart
He ate my heart

875
01:07:51,934 --> 01:07:55,233
He ate my heart
He ate my heart out

876
01:07:55,438 --> 01:07:59,169
Look at him, look at me

877
01:07:59,375 --> 01:08:03,038
That boy is bad, and honestly

878
01:08:03,245 --> 01:08:07,204
He's a wolf in disguise

879
01:08:07,416 --> 01:08:09,941
But I can't stop staring in those evil eyes

880
01:08:10,152 --> 01:08:12,120
Evil eyes, evil

881
01:08:12,321 --> 01:08:15,813
I asked my girlfriend
If she'd seen you around before

882
01:08:16,025 --> 01:08:20,018
She mumbled something
While we got down on the floor

883
01:08:20,229 --> 01:08:22,220
We might've fucked
Not really sure

884
01:08:22,431 --> 01:08:23,898
Don't quite recall

885
01:08:24,100 --> 01:08:26,261
But something tells me
That I've seen him before

886
01:08:26,469 --> 01:08:27,527
Put your hands up.

887
01:08:27,736 --> 01:08:30,500
That boy is a monster
Monster

888
01:08:30,706 --> 01:08:34,733
That boy is a monster
Monster

889
01:08:34,944 --> 01:08:38,744
That boy is a monster
Monster

890
01:08:38,948 --> 01:08:43,908
That boy is a monster

891
01:08:44,120 --> 01:08:47,954
- He ate my heart
- I love that girl

892
01:08:48,157 --> 01:08:49,624
He ate my heart

893
01:08:49,825 --> 01:08:51,850
Wanna talk to her
She's hot as hell

894
01:08:52,061 --> 01:08:55,724
- He ate my heart
- I love that girl

895
01:08:55,931 --> 01:08:57,455
He ate my heart

896
01:08:57,666 --> 01:08:59,327
Wanna talk to her
She's hot as hell

897
01:08:59,535 --> 01:09:02,902
He licked his lips
Said to me

898
01:09:03,105 --> 01:09:07,064
"Girl, you look
Good enough to eat"

899
01:09:07,276 --> 01:09:10,712
Put his arms around me

900
01:09:10,913 --> 01:09:15,213
Said, "Boy, now get your paws
Right off of me"

901
01:09:16,352 --> 01:09:19,947
I asked my girlfriend
If she'd seen you around before

902
01:09:20,156 --> 01:09:24,024
She mumbled something
While we got down on the floor

903
01:09:24,226 --> 01:09:26,285
We might've fucked
Not really sure

904
01:09:26,495 --> 01:09:27,587
Don't quite recall

905
01:09:27,796 --> 01:09:30,390
But something tells me
That I've seen him here before

906
01:09:30,599 --> 01:09:32,066
Put your paws up.

907
01:09:32,268 --> 01:09:34,828
That boy is a monster
Monster

908
01:09:35,037 --> 01:09:38,768
That boy is a monster
Monster

909
01:09:38,974 --> 01:09:42,637
That boy is a monster
Monster

910
01:09:42,845 --> 01:09:47,873
That boy is a monster

911
01:09:48,083 --> 01:09:51,712
- He ate my heart
- I love that girl

912
01:09:51,921 --> 01:09:53,616
He ate my heart

913
01:09:53,822 --> 01:09:55,687
Wanna talk to her
She's hot as hell

914
01:09:55,891 --> 01:09:59,952
- He ate my heart
- I love that girl

915
01:10:00,162 --> 01:10:01,959
He ate my heart

916
01:10:02,164 --> 01:10:03,995
Wanna talk to her
She's hot as hell

917
01:10:04,533 --> 01:10:08,060
He ate my heart
He ate my heart

918
01:10:08,270 --> 01:10:11,933
Instead he's the monster in my bed

919
01:10:12,408 --> 01:10:16,310
He ate my heart
He ate my heart

920
01:10:16,512 --> 01:10:19,447
Instead he's the monster in my bed

921
01:10:19,648 --> 01:10:24,244
I wanna just dance
But he took me home instead

922
01:10:24,453 --> 01:10:28,048
There was a monster in my bed

923
01:10:28,257 --> 01:10:31,192
We French kissed
On a subway train

924
01:10:31,393 --> 01:10:33,088
He tore my clothes right off

925
01:10:33,295 --> 01:10:36,924
He ate my heart
And then he ate my brain

926
01:10:38,801 --> 01:10:39,995
I love that girl

927
01:10:41,704 --> 01:10:43,672
Wanna talk to her
She's hot as hell

928
01:10:43,872 --> 01:10:47,399
He ate my heart
He ate my heart

929
01:10:47,610 --> 01:10:49,703
He ate my heart

930
01:10:49,912 --> 01:10:51,743
Wanna talk to her
She's hot as hell

931
01:10:51,947 --> 01:10:53,175
That boy, that boy

932
01:10:53,382 --> 01:10:54,644
That boy, that boy, that boy

933
01:10:54,850 --> 01:10:57,842
That boy is a monster
Monster

934
01:10:58,053 --> 01:11:00,715
Could I love him?

935
01:11:02,124 --> 01:11:04,888
Could I love him?

936
01:11:05,661 --> 01:11:08,755
Could I love him?

937
01:11:09,999 --> 01:11:11,398
Put your paws up, New York.

938
01:11:14,336 --> 01:11:17,100
Could I love him?

939
01:11:17,673 --> 01:11:20,608
Could I love him?

940
01:11:22,344 --> 01:11:24,812
Could I love him?

941
01:11:34,723 --> 01:11:37,351
Do you think I'm sexy?

942
01:11:39,862 --> 01:11:42,387
Because I think you're sexy.

943
01:11:45,067 --> 01:11:48,298
I used to get bullied a lot
in high school...

944
01:11:48,504 --> 01:11:51,166
...by these really awful, mean girls...

945
01:11:51,373 --> 01:11:54,570
...who weighed about 3O pounds
less than I did.

946
01:11:56,512 --> 01:12:00,039
And it used to make me feel
really bad about myself.

947
01:12:00,683 --> 01:12:02,913
But I'm here to tell you...

948
01:12:03,118 --> 01:12:04,745
...that someday you'll have...

949
01:12:04,953 --> 01:12:08,855
...a stage upon which
to stand and sing and dance...

950
01:12:09,058 --> 01:12:11,925
...in front of all those
who bullied you before.

951
01:12:18,367 --> 01:12:20,028
Do you feel sexy?

952
01:12:26,141 --> 01:12:29,076
You know, I'm kind of like Tinker Bell.

953
01:12:29,278 --> 01:12:32,975
You know how Tinker Bell will die
if you don't clap for her?

954
01:12:35,150 --> 01:12:37,516
Do you want me to die?

955
01:12:37,720 --> 01:12:40,348
Scream for me!

956
01:12:49,665 --> 01:12:52,133
Some people would like me to die.

957
01:12:54,503 --> 01:12:58,462
But I'm not going anywhere.

958
01:13:02,144 --> 01:13:05,545
Does anyone know what I hate
almost as much as I hate money?

959
01:13:05,748 --> 01:13:07,238
- Truth!
- The truth!

960
01:13:07,449 --> 01:13:10,680
Yes, I hate the truth.

961
01:13:10,886 --> 01:13:14,879
The French call it "la vérité."

962
01:13:17,760 --> 01:13:19,421
In fact, I hate the truth so much...

963
01:13:19,628 --> 01:13:24,361
...l'd prefer a giant dose of bullshit
any day over the truth.

964
01:13:28,036 --> 01:13:31,096
So, mes petits monstres...

965
01:13:31,974 --> 01:13:35,910
Show me your teeth

966
01:13:37,613 --> 01:13:39,877
Don't be scared

967
01:13:40,082 --> 01:13:42,346
I've done this before

968
01:13:42,551 --> 01:13:44,542
Show me your teeth

969
01:13:44,753 --> 01:13:46,243
Let me see your teeth

970
01:13:49,024 --> 01:13:51,754
Show me your teeth

971
01:13:52,761 --> 01:13:54,160
Show me your teeth

972
01:13:56,532 --> 01:13:59,660
- Don't want no money
- Want your money

973
01:13:59,868 --> 01:14:01,426
That shit is ugly

974
01:14:01,637 --> 01:14:03,969
- Just want your sex
- Want your sex

975
01:14:04,173 --> 01:14:06,607

01:14:11,680 --> 01:14:14,444
- Show me your teeth
- Let me see your mean

979
01:14:16,919 --> 01:14:19,217
- Got no direction
- No direction

980
01:14:19,421 --> 01:14:21,651
I need direction

981
01:14:21,857 --> 01:14:25,088
Just got my vamp
Got my vamp

982

985
01:14:33,836 --> 01:14:36,066
Show me your teeth

986
01:14:36,538 --> 01:14:38,506
Tell me something that'll save me

987
01:14:38,707 --> 01:14:41,471
- I need a man who makes me all right
- A man who makes me all right

988
01:14:41,677 --> 01:14:43,304
Tell me something that'll change me

989
01:14:43,512 --> 01:14:45,537
I'm gonna love you
With my hands tied

990
01:14:45,747 --> 01:14:47,772
- Show me your teeth
- Just tell me when

991
01:14:47,983 --> 01:14:50,349

- Got no salvation
- No salvation

995
01:15:00,162 --> 01:15:01,652
Got no salvation

996
01:15:01,864 --> 01:15:03,388
I got no religion

997
01:15:03,599 --> 01:15:04,588
Thank you.

998
01:15:04,800 --> 01:15:06,427
My religion is you

999
01:15:06,635 --> 01:15:10,298
- Take a bite of my bad girl meat
- Bad girl meat

1000
01:15:10,506 --> 01:15:13,498
Oh! Show me your teeth

1001
01:15:13,709 --> 01:15:15,734
Show me your teeth

1002
01:15:16,612 --> 01:15:19,240
- Got my addictions
- My addictions

1003
01:15:21,950 --> 01:15:24,384
- And I love to fix 'em
- And I love to fix 'em

1004
01:15:24,586 --> 01:15:26,747
No one's perfect

1005
01:15:26,955 --> 01:15:28,684
Take a bite of my bad girl...

1006
01:15:28,891 --> 01:15:30,984
Get up, dance.

1007
01:15:31,460 --> 01:15:35,760
- Show me your teeth
- Show me your teeth

1008
01:15:36,632 --> 01:15:38,190
Tell me something that'll save me

1009
01:15:38,400 --> 01:15:41,369
- I need a man who makes me all right
- A man who makes me all right

1010
01:15:41,570 --> 01:15:43,595
Tell me something that'll change me

1011
01:15:43,805 --> 01:15:45,500
I'm gonna love you
With my hands tied

1012
01:15:45,707 --> 01:15:47,937
- Show me your teeth
- Just tell me when

1013
01:15:48,143 --> 01:15:50,373
- Show me your teeth
- Open your mouth, boy

1014
01:15:50,579 --> 01:15:52,877
Show me your teeth
Show me what you got

1015
01:15:53,081 --> 01:15:55,481
Show me your teeth, teeth
Teeth, teeth

1016
01:15:55,684 --> 01:15:57,311
Show me your teeth

1017
01:15:57,519 --> 01:15:59,316
Come on, New York.

1018
01:16:00,022 --> 01:16:01,353
My religion is you

1019
01:16:01,557 --> 01:16:04,048
- Get on your feet!
- My religion is you

1020
01:16:04,259 --> 01:16:06,124
Let's go.

1021
01:16:06,328 --> 01:16:08,660
Hello, lady bunny.

1022
01:16:08,864 --> 01:16:10,855
I see you from all the way over here.

1023
01:16:11,066 --> 01:16:14,433
You better work that weave, girl,
just like I am.

1024
01:16:14,636 --> 01:16:15,967
I paid for it.

1025
01:16:16,171 --> 01:16:18,401
Help, need a man
Now show me your fangs

1026
01:16:18,607 --> 01:16:19,733
Come on, Montana.

1027
01:16:19,942 --> 01:16:21,375
Now show me your fangs

1028
01:16:21,577 --> 01:16:24,375
Some people would say
that Montana is not a religious woman.

1029
01:16:24,580 --> 01:16:27,105
But we think my finding a man
is a damn religion.

1030
01:16:27,316 --> 01:16:28,613
Save me

1031
01:16:28,817 --> 01:16:31,786
- I need a man who makes me all right
- A man who makes me all right

1032
01:16:31,987 --> 01:16:33,579
Tell me something that'll change me

1033
01:16:33,789 --> 01:16:35,484
I'm gonna love you
With my hands

1034
01:16:35,691 --> 01:16:37,818
- Show me your teeth
- Just tell me when

1035
01:16:38,026 --> 01:16:40,324
- Show me your teeth
- Open your mouth, boy

1036
01:16:40,529 --> 01:16:42,861
Show me your teeth
Show me what you got

1037
01:16:43,065 --> 01:16:45,397
Show me your teeth, teeth
Teeth, teeth

1038
01:16:45,601 --> 01:16:47,466
Show me your teeth

1039
01:16:47,669 --> 01:16:51,196
Some people say
that I'm not a religious woman.

1040
01:16:51,406 --> 01:16:55,137
So come on, New York,
let's go to church.

1041
01:16:55,344 --> 01:16:56,709
Show me your teeth

1042
01:16:56,912 --> 01:16:58,038
Show me your teeth

1043
01:16:58,246 --> 01:17:00,407
- Show me your teeth
- Show me your teeth

1044
01:17:00,616 --> 01:17:01,708
Show me your teeth

1045
01:17:01,917 --> 01:17:03,043
Show me your teeth

1046
01:17:03,251 --> 01:17:06,550
Show me your teeth, teeth
Teeth, teeth

1047
01:17:06,755 --> 01:17:09,053
- Show me your teeth
- Show me your teeth

1048
01:17:09,257 --> 01:17:10,417
Show me your teeth

1049
01:17:10,626 --> 01:17:11,752
Show me your teeth

1050
01:17:11,960 --> 01:17:13,757
Show me your teeth

1051
01:17:13,962 --> 01:17:15,987
Teeth, teeth, teeth, teeth

1052
01:17:25,340 --> 01:17:27,638
Spanky...

1053
01:17:27,843 --> 01:17:30,505
...all the way from
the Church of Philadelphia...

1054
01:17:30,712 --> 01:17:32,907
Show me your teeth

1055
01:17:39,388 --> 01:17:41,879
Show me your teeth

1056
01:17:50,899 --> 01:17:54,960
Just in case
any of you were wondering...

1057
01:17:55,170 --> 01:18:00,107
...if I ever lip-synch during my shows...

1058
01:18:02,577 --> 01:18:05,307
...the answer is no.

1059
01:18:05,514 --> 01:18:06,572
I never lip-synch.

1060
01:18:06,782 --> 01:18:10,047
I never have lip-synched.
And I never will.

1061
01:18:10,252 --> 01:18:14,052
And as long as you're paying money
to buy a ticket to see my show...

1062
01:18:14,256 --> 01:18:16,224
...l'm not gonna waste
your goddamn time...

1063
01:18:16,425 --> 01:18:20,418
...watching some bitch lip-synch her way
through an HBO special.

1064
01:18:20,629 --> 01:18:23,427
Show me your teeth
Teeth

1065
01:18:23,632 --> 01:18:28,763
Teeth

1066
01:18:32,808 --> 01:18:36,335
Especially not while Liza's watching.

1067
01:18:36,578 --> 01:18:39,069
Show me your teeth
Teeth, teeth

1068
01:18:39,281 --> 01:18:41,772
Teeth

1069
01:18:49,491 --> 01:18:51,618
Jesus

1070
01:18:51,827 --> 01:18:54,557
Jesus, are you listenin'?

1071
01:18:54,996 --> 01:18:57,157
Jesus over there in heaven

1072
01:18:57,365 --> 01:18:59,993
Jesus, I'm confused.

1073
01:19:00,736 --> 01:19:04,536
Jesus, some people say that you only
love a certain kind of person...

1074
01:19:04,740 --> 01:19:10,576
...with certain kind of beliefs
or background or sexual orientation.

1075
01:19:11,346 --> 01:19:13,644
But, Jesus, you have blessed me.

1076
01:19:13,849 --> 01:19:17,751
And every night,
myself and the entire House of Gaga...

1077
01:19:17,953 --> 01:19:20,945
...bleed to death
in front of 24,OOO people...

1078
01:19:21,156 --> 01:19:23,818
...talking about love and unity.

1079
01:19:24,025 --> 01:19:29,930
So I'm quite certain
that Jesus must love everybody!

1080
01:19:33,902 --> 01:19:35,995
Jesus loves...

1081
01:19:39,407 --> 01:19:41,204
...everybody.

1082
01:19:42,444 --> 01:19:45,208
Show me your teeth

1083
01:19:50,385 --> 01:19:53,513
Show me your teeth

1084
01:19:58,093 --> 01:20:01,620
Show me your teeth
Teeth, teeth

1085
01:20:01,830 --> 01:20:05,994
Teeth

1086
01:20:07,269 --> 01:20:10,295
You are such an asshole.

1087
01:20:10,505 --> 01:20:11,802
You know that?

1088
01:20:12,007 --> 01:20:14,669
You are such an asshole
on that instrument.

1089
01:20:14,876 --> 01:20:19,836
You are so goddamn disrespectful
on that guitar.

1090
01:20:20,048 --> 01:20:24,041
Who taught you to play
guitar like that, Jesus?

1091
01:20:24,252 --> 01:20:27,380
Show me your teeth
Teeth, teeth

1092
01:20:27,589 --> 01:20:29,955
Teeth

1093
01:20:38,133 --> 01:20:41,534
Everybody, this is Michael.

1094
01:20:41,736 --> 01:20:44,864
Michael's from Germany.

1095
01:20:48,009 --> 01:20:49,772
You're so cute.

1096
01:20:49,978 --> 01:20:52,003
That's so nice.

1097
01:20:52,214 --> 01:20:54,205
I like Michael...

1098
01:20:54,416 --> 01:20:56,543
...because Michael likes
girls from New York.

1099
01:21:01,523 --> 01:21:03,252
I also like Michael...

1100
01:21:03,458 --> 01:21:06,621
...because Michael likes
boys from New York.

1101
01:21:10,932 --> 01:21:16,393
Just like Jesus,
Michael loves everybody.

1102
01:21:19,441 --> 01:21:21,966
So come on, Kern.

1103
01:21:22,177 --> 01:21:25,408
Kern's a bad bass player.

1104
01:21:26,581 --> 01:21:29,277
And I told them last night
when they came to see my show...

1105
01:21:29,484 --> 01:21:30,951
...I said when l...

1106
01:21:31,152 --> 01:21:34,883
When I auditioned my band,
I closed my eyes.

1107
01:21:35,891 --> 01:21:38,257
I didn't look at them when they came in.
I closed my eyes.

1108
01:21:38,460 --> 01:21:41,020
I said, "I don't want to know
what they look like.

1109
01:21:41,229 --> 01:21:44,062
I wanna hear how they feel."

1110
01:21:44,833 --> 01:21:48,929
And when I heard this man
play the bass...

1111
01:21:49,137 --> 01:21:51,867
...I knew it was his destiny.

1112
01:21:52,073 --> 01:21:53,904
Show me your teeth

1113
01:21:59,848 --> 01:22:02,942
Show me your teeth

1114
01:22:09,824 --> 01:22:11,086
Michael.

1115
01:22:11,293 --> 01:22:14,751
I don't care who you are

1116
01:22:14,963 --> 01:22:17,761
Or what you believe

1117
01:22:17,966 --> 01:22:22,232
All I care about is
How you feel about me

1118
01:22:22,437 --> 01:22:29,366
Show me your teeth

1119
01:22:33,748 --> 01:22:35,181
I love you too.

1120
01:22:35,383 --> 01:22:38,045
Show me your teeth
Teeth, teeth

1121
01:22:38,253 --> 01:22:40,619
Teeth

1122
01:22:43,625 --> 01:22:45,616
There it is.

1123
01:22:46,361 --> 01:22:47,919
The eternal fountain.

1124
01:22:51,566 --> 01:22:56,196
The only fountain in the world
that bleeds for you.

1125
01:22:57,339 --> 01:23:01,173
Because my religion is you,
little monsters.

1126
01:23:02,844 --> 01:23:04,539
And tonight...

1127
01:23:05,981 --> 01:23:07,778
...like every night...

1128
01:23:07,983 --> 01:23:09,678
...my religion is New York.

1129
01:23:30,438 --> 01:23:32,736
Alejandro

1130
01:23:33,975 --> 01:23:36,535
Alejandro

1131
01:23:50,358 --> 01:23:53,953
I know that we are young
And I know that you may love me

1132
01:23:54,162 --> 01:24:00,965
But I just can't be with you
Like this anymore, Alejandro

1133
01:24:02,937 --> 01:24:04,802
I can't live without you

1134
01:24:05,006 --> 01:24:06,940
I can't breathe without you

1135
01:24:07,142 --> 01:24:08,973
Without you I have nothing

1136
01:24:09,177 --> 01:24:10,838
Yeah, right.

1137
01:24:16,051 --> 01:24:18,781
Sing for me.
Let me hear how strong you are.

1138
01:24:19,554 --> 01:24:22,682
- She's got both hands
- Both hands

1139
01:24:22,891 --> 01:24:25,325
- In her pocket
- In her pocket

1140
01:24:25,527 --> 01:24:28,985
- And she won't look at you
- Won't look at you

1141
01:24:29,197 --> 01:24:32,030
- She hides true love
- True love

1142
01:24:34,969 --> 01:24:39,872
She's got a halo around her finger
Around you

1143
01:24:40,075 --> 01:24:42,566
You know that I love you, boy

1144
01:24:42,777 --> 01:24:44,938
Hot like Mexico
Rejoice

1145
01:24:45,146 --> 01:24:46,943
At this point I've gotta choose

1146
01:24:47,148 --> 01:24:48,672
Nothing to lose

1147
01:24:48,883 --> 01:24:53,616
Don't call my name
Don't call my name, Alejandro

1148
01:24:53,822 --> 01:24:58,657
I'm not your babe
I'm not your babe, Fernando

1149
01:24:58,860 --> 01:25:00,987
Don't wanna kiss
Don't wanna touch

1150
01:25:01,196 --> 01:25:03,357
Just smoke my cigarette and hush

1151
01:25:03,565 --> 01:25:07,558
Don't call my name
Don't call my name, Roberto

1152
01:25:07,769 --> 01:25:08,827
Hands up.

1153
01:25:09,037 --> 01:25:11,562
Alejandro, Alejandro

1154
01:25:14,109 --> 01:25:17,670
Ale-Alejandro
Ale-Alejandro

1155
01:25:18,880 --> 01:25:21,371
Alejandro, Alejandro

1156
01:25:24,018 --> 01:25:27,454
Ale-Alejandro
Ale-Alejandro

1157
01:25:28,756 --> 01:25:33,056
Stop, please
Just let me go

1158
01:25:33,261 --> 01:25:37,061
Alejandro
Just let me go

1159
01:25:37,265 --> 01:25:42,828
She's not broken
She's just a baby

1160
01:25:43,037 --> 01:25:46,404
But her boyfriend's like her dad
Just like her dad

1161
01:25:46,608 --> 01:25:52,444
And all those flames that
Burned before him

1162
01:25:52,647 --> 01:25:56,481
Now he's gotta firefight
Gotta cool the bad

1163
01:25:57,819 --> 01:25:59,719
You know that I love you, boy

1164
01:25:59,921 --> 01:26:02,651
Hot like Mexico
Rejoice

1165
01:26:02,857 --> 01:26:04,688
At this point I've gotta choose

1166
01:26:04,893 --> 01:26:06,554
Put your hands up.

1167
01:26:06,761 --> 01:26:11,130
Don't call my name
Don't call my name, Alejandro

1168
01:26:11,332 --> 01:26:16,326
I'm not your babe
I'm not your babe, Fernando

1169
01:26:16,538 --> 01:26:18,665
Don't wanna kiss
Don't wanna touch

1170
01:26:18,873 --> 01:26:20,807
Just smoke my cigarette and hush

1171
01:26:21,009 --> 01:26:26,106
Don't call my name
Don't call my name, Roberto

1172
01:26:26,314 --> 01:26:29,374
Alejandro, Alejandro

1173
01:26:31,619 --> 01:26:35,020
Ale-Alejandro
Ale-Alejandro

1174
01:26:35,723 --> 01:26:39,090
Alejandro, Alejandro

1175
01:26:41,362 --> 01:26:45,423
Ale-Alejandro
Ale-Alejandro

1176
01:26:45,633 --> 01:26:48,227
Don't bother me
Don't bother me

1177
01:26:50,538 --> 01:26:53,234
Don't call my name
Don't call my name

1178
01:26:55,310 --> 01:26:58,279
I'm not your babe
I'm not your babe

1179
01:27:00,215 --> 01:27:02,843
Don't wanna kiss
Don't wanna touch

1180
01:27:03,051 --> 01:27:04,746
Fernando

1181
01:27:04,953 --> 01:27:09,583
Don't call my name
Don't call my name, Alejandro

1182
01:27:09,791 --> 01:27:14,387
I'm not your babe
I'm not your babe, Fernando

1183
01:27:14,596 --> 01:27:16,757
Don't wanna kiss
Don't wanna touch

1184
01:27:16,965 --> 01:27:19,024
Just smoke my cigarette and hush

1185
01:27:19,234 --> 01:27:21,702
Don't call my name
Don't call my name

1186
01:27:21,903 --> 01:27:24,463
Now put your hands up for equality.

1187
01:27:24,672 --> 01:27:27,732
Alejandro, Alejandro

1188
01:27:27,942 --> 01:27:30,672
Because we all love
and we all fight the same.

1189
01:27:30,878 --> 01:27:33,745
Ale-Alejandro
Ale-Alejandro

1190
01:27:34,415 --> 01:27:37,111
Alejandro, Alejandro

1191
01:27:39,754 --> 01:27:43,622
Ale-Alejandro
Ale-Alejandro

1192
01:27:43,825 --> 01:27:48,421
Don't call my name
Don't call my name, Alejandro

1193
01:27:48,630 --> 01:27:53,124
I'm not your babe
I'm not your babe, Fernando

1194
01:27:53,334 --> 01:27:55,598
Don't wanna kiss
Don't wanna touch

1195
01:27:55,803 --> 01:27:57,896
Just smoke my cigarette and hush

1196
01:27:58,106 --> 01:28:03,100
Don't call my name
Don't call my name, Roberto

1197
01:28:03,311 --> 01:28:05,108
Alejandro

1198
01:28:40,348 --> 01:28:42,145
Do you hear that?

1199
01:28:44,118 --> 01:28:47,019
This is the record that changed my life.

1200
01:28:49,324 --> 01:28:50,951
Just like you.

1201
01:28:51,159 --> 01:28:52,786
Now dance.

1202
01:28:59,767 --> 01:29:03,259
I wanna hold 'em
Like they do in Texas plays

1203
01:29:03,471 --> 01:29:06,201
Fold 'em, let 'em hit me
Raise it, baby, stay with me

1204
01:29:06,407 --> 01:29:07,396
I love it

1205
01:29:07,608 --> 01:29:11,169
Love Game intuition
Play the cards with spades to start

1206
01:29:11,379 --> 01:29:15,679
And after he's been hooked
I'll play the one that's on his heart

1207
01:29:19,887 --> 01:29:23,584
I'll get him hot
Show him what I've got

1208
01:29:28,029 --> 01:29:30,623
I'll get him hot
Show him what l...

1209
01:29:30,832 --> 01:29:31,821
Now jump.

1210
01:29:32,033 --> 01:29:33,796
Can't read my
Can't read my

1211
01:29:34,001 --> 01:29:37,869
No, he can't read my poker face

1212
01:29:38,072 --> 01:29:40,097
She's got me like nobody

1213
01:29:40,308 --> 01:29:41,935
Can't read my
Can't read my

1214
01:29:42,143 --> 01:29:45,806
No, he can't read my poker face

1215
01:29:46,013 --> 01:29:48,243
- She's got me like nobody

1216
01:29:48,449 --> 01:29:51,111
Poker face, poker face

01:29:52,520 --> 01:29:54,954
Poker face, poker face

1218
01:29:56,691 --> 01:29:59,819
I wanna roll with him
A hard pair we will be

1219
01:30:00,027 --> 01:30:02,928
A little gambling is fun
When you're with me

1220
01:30:03,131 --> 01:30:04,120
I love it

1221
01:30:04,332 --> 01:30:07,597
Russian roulette
Is not the same without a gun

1222
01:30:07,802 --> 01:30:12,034
And, baby, when it's love
If it's not rough, it isn't fun, fun

1223
01:30:16,344 --> 01:30:20,212
I'll get him hot
Show him what I've got

1224
01:30:24,419 --> 01:30:27,149
I'll get him hot
Show him what l...

1225
01:30:27,355 --> 01:30:28,413

1232
01:30:44,939 --> 01:30:47,499
Poker face, poker face

Poker face, poker face

1234
01:30:51,879 --> 01:30:54,780
I won't tell you that I love you
Kiss or hug you

1235
01:30:54,982 --> 01:30:56,813
'Cause I'm bluffin' with my muffin

1236
01:30:57,018 --> 01:31:00,977
I'm not lying, I'm just stunnin'
With my love glue gunnin'

1237
01:31:01,189 --> 01:31:02,850
Just like a chick in the casino

1238
01:31:03,057 --> 01:31:05,150
Take your bank
Before I pay you out

1239
01:31:05,359 --> 01:31:06,986
I promise this
Promise this

1240
01:31:07,195 --> 01:31:08,924

No, he can't read my poker face

1246
01:31:22,410 --> 01:31:24,776
She's got me like nobody

01:31:24,979 --> 01:31:26,674
Can't read my
Can't read my

No, he can't read my poker face

1249
01:31:30,518 --> 01:31:33,009

01:31:38,826 --> 01:31:40,555
She's got me like nobody

1253
01:31:40,761 --> 01:31:42,820
Yeah!

1254
01:31:50,571 --> 01:31:52,471
Come on, make me sweat.

1255
01:32:33,047 --> 01:32:34,605
You guys...

1256
01:32:34,815 --> 01:32:37,215
...I think that the Monster Ball
is just up ahead...

1257
01:32:37,418 --> 01:32:39,045
...maybe on the right?

1258
01:32:39,253 --> 01:32:42,586
Are you sure, Gaga?
It doesn't look too good.

1259
01:32:44,091 --> 01:32:45,581
- Lan.
- Yeah?

1260
01:32:45,793 --> 01:32:48,785
I can't see you. Champagne?

1261
01:32:48,996 --> 01:32:51,760
I'm here, Gaga, but I don't think
we should go anymore.

1262
01:32:51,966 --> 01:32:53,433
It's so dark out here.

1263
01:32:53,634 --> 01:32:56,728
Oh, come on, you guys.
We can't give up now.

1264
01:32:56,938 --> 01:32:59,873
The Monster Ball
is the greatest party on the planet.

1265
01:33:00,074 --> 01:33:03,441
And tonight
it's at Madison Square Garden.

1266
01:33:06,213 --> 01:33:07,612
I'm scared.

1267
01:33:08,182 --> 01:33:10,047
I think it's just up ahead.

1268
01:33:10,251 --> 01:33:12,549
It's just so dark I can't see.

1269
01:33:15,022 --> 01:33:17,684
You know, I think I'm just gonna go.

1270
01:33:17,892 --> 01:33:19,291
- What?
- Lan, come on.

1271
01:33:19,493 --> 01:33:21,791
Oh, come on, lan,
you wouldn't leave me, would you?

1272
01:33:21,996 --> 01:33:25,124
Gaga, you know I love you,
but you're going too far.

1273
01:33:25,333 --> 01:33:27,961
- You're going too far, Gaga.
- What?

1274
01:33:28,169 --> 01:33:32,003
You can't leave me here by myself.
It's dark. I can't see.

1275
01:33:35,843 --> 01:33:39,574
Even if the whole world
turns their back on you...

1276
01:33:41,682 --> 01:33:43,980
...you always have yourself.

1277
01:34:00,901 --> 01:34:02,664
No!

1278
01:34:04,705 --> 01:34:07,173
It's the monster.

1279
01:34:07,375 --> 01:34:09,502
It's the fame monster.

1280
01:34:19,820 --> 01:34:21,447
We are the crowd

1281
01:34:21,656 --> 01:34:23,385
We're comin' out

1282
01:34:23,591 --> 01:34:27,220
Got my flash on, it's true
Need that picture of you

1283
01:34:27,428 --> 01:34:29,953
It so magical

1284
01:34:30,164 --> 01:34:34,464
We'd be so fantastical

1285
01:34:36,537 --> 01:34:38,061
Leather and jeans

1286
01:34:38,272 --> 01:34:39,967
Garage glamorous

1287
01:34:40,174 --> 01:34:41,903
Not sure what it means

1288
01:34:42,109 --> 01:34:44,100
But this photo of us

1289
01:34:44,311 --> 01:34:46,506
It don't have a price

1290
01:34:46,714 --> 01:34:50,548
Ready for those flashing lights

1291
01:34:50,751 --> 01:34:53,049
I recognize all of you.
Sing it.

1292
01:34:53,254 --> 01:34:58,214
I'm your biggest fan
I'll follow you until you love me

1293
01:34:58,426 --> 01:35:01,327
Papa-paparazzi

1294
01:35:01,529 --> 01:35:04,464
Baby, there's no other superstar

1295
01:35:04,665 --> 01:35:09,625
You know that I'll be
Your papa-paparazzi

1296
01:35:09,837 --> 01:35:12,704
Promise I'll be kind

1297
01:35:12,907 --> 01:35:18,174
But I won't stop until that boy is mine

1298
01:35:18,379 --> 01:35:23,248
Baby, you'll be famous
Chase you down until you love me

1299
01:35:23,451 --> 01:35:26,011
Papa-paparazzi

1300
01:35:26,220 --> 01:35:28,484
Thank you so much for being so brave.

1301
01:35:28,689 --> 01:35:30,213
You look so amazing.

1302
01:35:30,424 --> 01:35:33,120
Now help me kill him.
Get your cameras out.

1303
01:35:33,327 --> 01:35:34,817
Take that monster's picture.

1304
01:35:35,029 --> 01:35:38,396
I'll be your girl
Backstage at your show

1305
01:35:38,599 --> 01:35:42,535
Velvet ropes and guitars
Yeah, 'cause you're my rock star

1306
01:35:42,737 --> 01:35:48,607
In between the sets
Eyeliner and cigarettes

1307
01:35:48,809 --> 01:35:51,334
Oh, no, he's taking off my clothes.

1308
01:35:51,545 --> 01:35:54,912
Shadow is burnt
Yellow dance and we turn

1309
01:35:55,116 --> 01:35:58,984
My lashes are dry
Purple teardrops I cry

1310
01:35:59,186 --> 01:36:05,750
It don't have a price
Loving you is my cherry pie

1311
01:36:05,960 --> 01:36:08,121
'Cause you know that, baby, I

1312
01:36:08,329 --> 01:36:13,130
I'm your biggest fan
I'll follow you until you love me

1313
01:36:13,334 --> 01:36:16,462
Papa-paparazzi

1314
01:36:16,670 --> 01:36:19,639
Baby, there's no other superstar

1315
01:36:19,840 --> 01:36:24,800
You know that I'll be
Your papa-paparazzi

1316
01:36:25,012 --> 01:36:27,845
Promise I'll be kind

1317
01:36:28,048 --> 01:36:30,039
But I won't stop until that boy is mine

1318
01:36:30,251 --> 01:36:32,185
Just eat me already.

1319
01:36:33,154 --> 01:36:38,319
Baby, you'll be famous
Chase you down until you love me

1320
01:36:38,526 --> 01:36:41,757
Papa-paparazzi

1321
01:36:41,962 --> 01:36:45,796
Real good
We dance in the studio

1322
01:36:46,000 --> 01:36:50,164
Snap, snap
To that shit on the radio

1323
01:36:50,371 --> 01:36:54,705
Don't stop for anyone

1324
01:36:54,909 --> 01:36:57,776
We're plastic but we still have fun

1325
01:36:58,479 --> 01:37:03,416
I'm your biggest fan
I'll follow you until you love me

1326
01:37:03,617 --> 01:37:06,518
Papa-paparazzi

1327
01:37:06,720 --> 01:37:09,917
Baby, there's no other superstar

1328
01:37:10,124 --> 01:37:14,720
You know that I'll be
Your papa-paparazzi

1329
01:37:14,929 --> 01:37:16,226
Promise I'll be kind

1330
01:37:16,430 --> 01:37:21,527
Monsters, if we stick together,
we can do anything.

1331
01:37:23,470 --> 01:37:24,596
Baby, you'll be famous

1332
01:37:24,805 --> 01:37:26,295
And when they ask you:

1333
01:37:27,508 --> 01:37:31,137
"How was Gaga at the Monster Ball...

1334
01:37:31,345 --> 01:37:33,813
...at Madison Square Garden?"

1335
01:37:35,216 --> 01:37:36,911
You tell them:

1336
01:37:37,117 --> 01:37:38,880
"She burned the place...

1337
01:37:39,520 --> 01:37:44,480
We burned that place
to the fucking ground!"

1338
01:37:50,397 --> 01:37:52,194
We did it.

1339
01:37:52,399 --> 01:37:54,162
We killed him.

1340
01:37:57,471 --> 01:37:59,871
Now let's get out of here.

1341
01:38:01,208 --> 01:38:03,802
Let's go to the Monster Ball.

1342
01:38:05,246 --> 01:38:06,645
Good night.

1343
01:38:07,548 --> 01:38:09,277
Good night, monsters.

1344
01:38:09,750 --> 01:38:13,311
Friends, be yourself.

1345
01:38:13,520 --> 01:38:15,784
Love who you are.

1346
01:38:15,990 --> 01:38:17,218
Be proud.

1347
01:38:17,691 --> 01:38:20,922
And never give up on your dreams.

1348
01:38:21,128 --> 01:38:23,153
Because you were
born this way, baby.

1349
01:39:08,042 --> 01:39:11,170
Caught in a bad romance

1350
01:39:17,217 --> 01:39:21,244
Caught in a bad romance

1351
01:39:24,892 --> 01:39:26,689
We did it.

1352
01:39:26,894 --> 01:39:28,623
Caught in a bad romance

1353
01:39:28,829 --> 01:39:30,296
We did it, monsters.

1354
01:39:32,266 --> 01:39:34,496
We made it to the Monster Ball.

1355
01:39:34,702 --> 01:39:38,399
We made it to Madison Square Garden
in New York City.

1356
01:39:41,075 --> 01:39:43,100
Did you have the time of your life?

1357
01:39:43,310 --> 01:39:45,574
Do you feel free, monster?

1358
01:39:45,779 --> 01:39:46,871

1359

I want your disease

1362
01:39:59,360 --> 01:40:02,124

As long as it's free

1363
01:40:02,329 --> 01:40:04,695

The touch of your hand

01:43:55,662 --> 01:43:57,129
Want your bad romance

1432
01:43:59,466 --> 01:44:02,060
Want your bad romance

1433
01:44:02,269 --> 01:44:04,829
Caught in a bad romance

1434
01:44:11,278 --> 01:44:13,405
Want your bad romance

1435
01:44:40,374 --> 01:44:43,309
If you scream really loud...

1436
01:44:43,510 --> 01:44:46,035
...I might just do one more.

1437
01:44:51,852 --> 01:44:54,446
I could just do one more.

1438
01:45:17,811 --> 01:45:19,802
Want your bad romance

1439
01:45:32,159 --> 01:45:34,855
It doesn't matter if you love him

1440
01:45:35,062 --> 01:45:37,462
Or capital H-l-M

1441
01:45:42,369 --> 01:45:44,564
Just put your paws up

1442
01:45:44,771 --> 01:45:47,001
'Cause you were born this way, baby

1443
01:45:58,318 --> 01:46:02,152
My mama told me when I was young

1444
01:46:02,356 --> 01:46:06,087
We are all born superstars

1445
01:46:06,293 --> 01:46:09,854
She rolled my hair
And put my lipstick on

1446
01:46:10,063 --> 01:46:12,861
In the glass of her boudoir

1447
01:46:14,000 --> 01:46:16,992
There's nothing wrong
With loving who you are

1448
01:46:17,204 --> 01:46:19,900
She said
'Cause he made you perfect, babe

1449
01:46:22,242 --> 01:46:25,507
So hold your head up, girl
And you'll go far

1450
01:46:25,712 --> 01:46:27,577
Listen to me when I say

1451
01:46:27,781 --> 01:46:28,907
Come on.

1452
01:46:29,116 --> 01:46:32,552
I'm beautiful in my way
'Cause God makes no mistakes

1453
01:46:32,753 --> 01:46:36,484
I'm on the right track, baby
I was born this way

1454
01:46:36,690 --> 01:46:40,057
Don't hide yourself in regret
Just love yourself and you're set

1455
01:46:40,260 --> 01:46:45,095
I'm on the right track, baby
I was born this way

1456
01:46:45,298 --> 01:46:48,426
There ain't no other way
Baby, I was born this way

1457
01:46:48,635 --> 01:46:52,696
- Baby, I was born this way
- Born this way

1458
01:46:52,906 --> 01:46:55,966
There ain't no other way
Baby, I was born this way

1459
01:46:56,176 --> 01:47:00,078
I'm on the right track, baby
I was born this way

1460
01:47:00,280 --> 01:47:04,011
Don't be a drag, just be a queen
Don't be a drag, just be a queen

1461
01:47:04,217 --> 01:47:05,878
Don't be a drag, just be a queen

1462
01:47:06,086 --> 01:47:08,384
Don't be

1463
01:47:08,588 --> 01:47:11,455
Give yourself prudence
And love your friends

1464
01:47:11,658 --> 01:47:14,422
So we can rejoice your truth

1465
01:47:16,296 --> 01:47:21,632
In the religion of the insecure
I must be myself, respect my youth

1466
01:47:23,770 --> 01:47:26,739
A different lover is not a sin

1467
01:47:26,940 --> 01:47:29,534
Believe capital H-l-M

1468
01:47:29,743 --> 01:47:31,506
Hey, hey, hey

1469

01:47:42,656 --> 01:47:46,057
I'm on the right track, baby

01:47:49,996 --> 01:47:54,433
I'm on the right track, baby

1476
01:47:54,634 --> 01:47:58,434
There ain't no other way
Baby, I was born this way

1477
01:47:58,638 --> 01:48:02,267

1480
01:48:13,453 --> 01:48:15,421
Don't be

1481
01:48:17,290 --> 01:48:19,383
Don't be a drag, just be a queen

1482
01:48:19,593 --> 01:48:23,359
Whether you're broke or evergreen
You're black, white, beige, chola descent

1483
01:48:23,563 --> 01:48:25,394
You're Lebanese, you're Orient

1484
01:48:25,599 --> 01:48:29,091
Whether life's disabilities
Left you outcast, bullied or teased

1485
01:48:29,302 --> 01:48:31,099
Rejoice and love yourself today

1486

Gay, straight or bi
Lesbian, transgendered life

01:48:57,731 --> 01:49:00,632
I'm on the right track, baby

1490
01:49:00,834 --> 01:49:04,998
I was born to survive

1491
01:49:05,205 --> 01:49:06,832
Survive

1492
01:49:07,908 --> 01:49:08,897
Come on.

01:49:09,109 --> 01:49:12,636
There ain't no other way
Baby, I was born this way

1494
01:49:12,846 --> 01:49:14,939
Baby, I was born this way

01:49:15,148 --> 01:49:16,809
Jump with me.

There ain't no other way

1497
01:49:18,285 --> 01:49:20,480
Yeah, yeah, yeah

1498
01:49:20,687 --> 01:49:24,521
I'm on the right track, baby

1499
01:49:24,724 --> 01:49:28,057

01:50:30,690 --> 01:50:33,887
Wow, that's how you leave
the fucking Garden.

1508
01:50:34,094 --> 01:50:35,823
That's how you leave the Garden.

1509
01:50:36,029 --> 01:50:37,462
Oh, my God.
Oh, my God.

1510
01:50:37,664 --> 01:50:39,894
- That's how you leave the Garden.
- Look at my dad.

1511
01:50:40,100 --> 01:50:41,761
But you'll be right back though.

1512
01:50:41,968 --> 01:50:43,435
Some little girl gave it to me.

1513
01:50:43,637 --> 01:50:45,867
Oh, thanks, Dad.

1514
01:50:49,843 --> 01:50:52,277
Now it's time to do
what real rock stars do:

1515
01:50:52,479 --> 01:50:54,447
Go to sleep.

1516
01:51:11,097 --> 01:51:16,034
My mama told me
When I was young

1517
01:51:16,236 --> 01:51:21,401
We are all born superstars
