00:06:34,454 --> 00:06:36,422
You're Shiv. And l'm Shiv too

32
00:06:37,457 --> 00:06:39,425
But you're God.
And l'm an ordinary human being

33
00:06:40,460 --> 00:06:43,429
Lord, l'm starting a new life today.
You must've seen the newspaper.

34
00:06:45,465 --> 00:06:47,433
l wonder how many people saw
that ad on the second page

35
00:06:48,468 --> 00:06:51,437
They want an Executive Manager.
One post, many aspirants

36
00:06:53,473 --> 00:06:55,441
But make sure You bless only me

37
00:06:57,477 --> 00:07:00,446
Lord, when will this devotee of Yours
find a job? When will l make money?

38
00:07:01,481 --> 00:07:04,450
When will l have a wife and kids?
When will l tell stories to them?

39
00:07:06,486 --> 00:07:09,455
Our little family will then
come here and sing praises to You

40
00:07:11,491 --> 00:07:12,458
Praise Lord Shankar

41
00:07:13,493 --> 00:07:15,461
Just get me this job, Lord... please

42
00:07:17,497 --> 00:07:19,465
And don't You think
of anyone else. Okay?

43
00:07:21,501 --> 00:07:24,470
No matter how much
anyone prays to You

44
00:07:27,507 --> 00:07:28,474
My obesiences, Goddess Parvati

45
00:07:29,509 --> 00:07:30,476
l will say nothing to Shivji.
He won't listen to anything

46
00:07:35,515 --> 00:07:38,484
A woman has to struggle so much
in a man's world

47
00:07:40,520 --> 00:07:43,489
We've got to get pushed around
so much, try so many tricks to make it

48
00:07:46,526 --> 00:07:48,494
Now for today's headlines

49
00:07:49,529 --> 00:07:51,497
Look at the speeches they make

50
00:07:52,532 --> 00:07:55,501
And women would have said the
same things with so much of compassion

51
00:07:56,536 --> 00:07:58,504
But some people just won't listen

52
00:08:01,541 --> 00:08:04,510
Let's see the second page.
Maybe l'll find some justice here

53
00:08:09,549 --> 00:08:12,518
A job! There is a vacancy!
For the post of Executive Manager!

54
00:08:15,555 --> 00:08:18,524
''Gender, no bar! The same status
for both, men and women''

55
00:08:20,560 --> 00:08:23,529
l could make it. l'm so qualified...
l just can't lose out.

56
00:08:27,567 --> 00:08:30,536
But You know who will be
the obstacle. Men again!

57
00:08:33,573 --> 00:08:34,574
lt's up to You now, O Goddess

58
00:08:34,574 --> 00:08:35,541
Please accept my humble plea

59
00:08:36,576 --> 00:08:37,543
And please get me this job

60
00:08:39,579 --> 00:08:42,548
You must win, Goddess.
Not Shivji. At least not this time

61
00:09:13,613 --> 00:09:15,581
Going to eat? Go on

62
00:09:23,623 --> 00:09:24,590
Will you have some water?
- No

63
00:09:25,625 --> 00:09:26,592
Tea?
- No

64
00:09:27,627 --> 00:09:28,628
A cigarette then?

65
00:09:28,628 --> 00:09:29,595

66
00:09:30,630 --> 00:09:32,598
How about meeting

67
00:09:37,637 --> 00:09:39,605
You have no vices.
You're going to get this job

68
00:09:40,640 --> 00:09:41,607
How come?
- True. This Hyderabadi...

69
00:09:43,643 --> 00:09:45,611
can understand what your heart says.
l've been doing it for years

70
00:09:47,647 --> 00:09:48,614
You're absolutely right, you know.

71
00:09:50,650 --> 00:09:52,618
l'm No 1 ! l have all the degrees
- Really?

72
00:09:54,654 --> 00:09:56,622
No power can stop you then

73
00:09:57,657 --> 00:10:00,626
l'm Dil-phenk Hyderabadi. You?
- My name... Shiv. Shiv Kapoor

74
00:10:04,664 --> 00:10:07,633
Shiv Kapoor? Do something, Pooja!
Or you're going to lose this job

75
00:10:09,669 --> 00:10:11,637
Think of something. Go on!

76
00:10:15,675 --> 00:10:17,643
What destiny! What luck, my boy!

77
00:10:22,682 --> 00:10:25,651
Don't you forget me.
- How can you say such a thing?

78
00:10:27,687 --> 00:10:29,655
As if l'd forget you! Don't worry.
- Dil-phenk, come here...

79
00:10:30,690 --> 00:10:33,659
and stop chatting. Come on.
- The gentleman is calling me

80
00:10:37,697 --> 00:10:38,664
He gives me great respect

81
00:10:40,700 --> 00:10:42,668
Don't you forget me
- Don't worry. Go on

82
00:11:01,721 --> 00:11:03,689
Who are you?
What are you here for?

83
00:11:05,725 --> 00:11:06,692
Sit down. Sit

84
00:11:08,728 --> 00:11:10,696
Okay, stand up....
Never mind. l'll sit down

85
00:11:13,733 --> 00:11:15,701
What's that in your hand?
- Certificates of my qualification

86
00:11:17,737 --> 00:11:19,705
For a job in Papa's office?
- Yes, well...

87
00:11:20,740 --> 00:11:23,709
they issued that ad in the newspapers
for the post of Executive Manager

88
00:11:26,746 --> 00:11:27,713
And so, l...

89
00:11:31,751 --> 00:11:33,719
Why? What happened?
- This morning at breakfast...

90
00:11:35,755 --> 00:11:39,714
Papa received a call from a
very influential man

91
00:11:40,760 --> 00:11:42,728
Your job is gone.
- Gone? How can that be?

92
00:11:44,764 --> 00:11:47,733
He receives a call and l lose my job?
Where is your Papa?

93
00:11:48,768 --> 00:11:49,735
Calm down... sit

94
00:11:52,772 --> 00:11:54,740
You want to go very far
in life, don't you?

95
00:11:55,775 --> 00:11:58,744
All right then, trust Papa's daughter
and please go away. Okay?

96
00:12:01,781 --> 00:12:04,750
You're such a rich man's daughter
and yet, so compassionate

97
00:12:16,796 --> 00:12:18,764
Only my name won't impress him.
You must show him l'm capable too

98
00:12:20,800 --> 00:12:22,768
Only then will he agree.
... when should l meet you again?

99
00:12:23,803 --> 00:12:26,772
You don't have to meet me.
l'll meet up with you

100
00:12:28,808 --> 00:12:30,776
l have your name and address, right?
- Right

101
00:12:31,811 --> 00:12:33,779
So please leave now. Or l won't be
able to help you. Go on!

102
00:12:35,815 --> 00:12:37,783
What is it now?
- You haven't told me your name

103
00:12:42,822 --> 00:12:44,790
Beautiful name.
My name is Shiv Kapoor

104
00:12:52,832 --> 00:12:53,799
Please don't forget

105
00:12:59,839 --> 00:13:00,806
Damn it!

106
00:13:01,841 --> 00:13:04,810
Thanks for living up
to Delhi's reputation

107
00:13:05,845 --> 00:13:07,813
You've rammed into my
beautiful car, haven't you?

108
00:13:08,848 --> 00:13:10,816
Your beautiful sister has
rammed into your beautiful car!

109
00:13:11,851 --> 00:13:12,818
Brother! l've found a job!
- Great news!

110
00:13:13,853 --> 00:13:14,820
Which means...

111
00:13:16,856 --> 00:13:19,825
keeping me up all night with you
has finally helped!

112
00:13:22,862 --> 00:13:24,830
l can now personally shoulder
my responsibilities

113
00:13:26,866 --> 00:13:29,835
Here you are. Keep the change
and just get lost!

114
00:13:33,873 --> 00:13:35,841
Great affection brother and sister
are showering on each other!

115
00:13:37,877 --> 00:13:39,845
l'll give you news that will
brighten up your mood too, sis-in-law

116
00:13:40,880 --> 00:13:42,848
Come on, brother. Let's tell her

117
00:13:48,888 --> 00:13:50,856
Great news, sis!
- Sis? My foot!

118
00:13:55,895 --> 00:13:57,863
Sister-in-law!
- Let go! What are you doing?

119
00:14:05,905 --> 00:14:07,873
He's already panting.
- He's panting out of happiness

120
00:14:10,910 --> 00:14:12,878
l've got a job as Executive Manager.
- Thank God!

121
00:14:13,913 --> 00:14:15,881
You'll stand on your own two feet.
- Here l am. On my feet!

122
00:14:16,916 --> 00:14:18,884
You must stand up too.
- What for?

123
00:14:20,920 --> 00:14:22,888
For not having to cook tonight.
l'm treating you to dinner

124
00:14:23,923 --> 00:14:25,891
Where?
- At Delhi's Number One restaurant

125
00:14:47,947 --> 00:14:50,916
Wow! Do we get to eat like this every
day, or is this a one-time treat?

126
00:14:51,951 --> 00:14:54,920
My sister has a large heart, Kittu.
She would do so much for us.

127
00:14:56,956 --> 00:14:59,925
That's okay. But Pooja hasn't told us
how she got such a big job so easily

128
00:15:01,961 --> 00:15:03,929
Want me to tell you the truth?
Or just fib?

129
00:15:04,964 --> 00:15:06,932
You're always fibbing.
So tell us the truth this time

130
00:15:07,967 --> 00:15:09,935
Very well then. Here goes.
When l got there...

131
00:15:10,970 --> 00:15:12,938
it was as if all the doors
were open for me

132
00:15:15,975 --> 00:15:17,943
There were many Toms, Dicks
and Harrys before l got there...

133
00:15:18,978 --> 00:15:20,946
but who could have possessed
my kind of personality?

134
00:15:21,981 --> 00:15:23,949
Oh yes.
- When l moved further...

135
00:15:24,984 --> 00:15:26,952
the staff were so impressed,
they got up to salute me

136
00:15:27,987 --> 00:15:29,955
They rolled out the red carpet
for me, leading to the boss

137
00:15:31,991 --> 00:15:33,959
Guess what the boss said,
when he saw me?

138
00:15:34,994 --> 00:15:35,961
Go on.
- He said, ''My child'' !

139
00:15:37,997 --> 00:15:40,966
Such abilities, talent, confidence
and personality? ln this nation?

140
00:15:42,001 --> 00:15:43,969
''Where were you all
these days, my child?''

141
00:15:45,004 --> 00:15:46,972
You ought to have told him
that you were with us

142
00:15:49,008 --> 00:15:50,976
Pooja, the boss called you ''child'' ?
- Oh yes, brother

143
00:15:54,013 --> 00:15:55,981
And l started calling him ''Papa'' too

144
00:15:59,018 --> 00:16:00,986
l'm sure it's divine intervention.
- Oh yes

145
00:16:03,022 --> 00:16:04,990
All thanks to Goddess Parvati.
l wonder how She got Shivji to agree

146
00:16:07,026 --> 00:16:08,994
Poojaji...
- Who's that?

147
00:16:11,030 --> 00:16:12,998
Shiv. The one with the
high qualifications

148
00:16:14,033 --> 00:16:16,001
Who are you?
- l'm Shiv... Shiv Kapoor

149
00:16:17,036 --> 00:16:20,005
l see. And what are you doing here?
- l'm drowning my sorrows, Poojaji

150
00:16:22,041 --> 00:16:24,009
lt's my friend's second
wedding anniversary

151
00:16:25,044 --> 00:16:26,011
l had to come,
he dragged me here.

152
00:16:27,046 --> 00:16:29,014
Or l was only thinking about you.
- What? Who's this, Pooja?

153
00:16:31,050 --> 00:16:33,018
Shivji...
- Shivji?

154
00:16:35,054 --> 00:16:37,022
Right. Shiv Kapoor. And you folks?
- My brother and my sister-in-law

155
00:16:40,059 --> 00:16:41,026
Hasn't Papaji come?

156
00:16:43,062 --> 00:16:45,030
Papaji?
- Yes. Papa

157
00:16:47,066 --> 00:16:49,034
Have l said something wrong?
- Not at all

158
00:16:50,069 --> 00:16:52,037
Didn't l tell you, brother?
Papa=Boss; Boss=Papa...?

159
00:16:53,072 --> 00:16:54,039
That's just it

160
00:16:56,075 --> 00:16:57,042
Okay, l'll do it for you

161
00:16:58,077 --> 00:17:00,045
Very well then...
- l see. Very well then!

162
00:17:03,082 --> 00:17:05,050
How can you leave like this?
You're Pooja's friend

163
00:17:08,087 --> 00:17:10,089
You must eat with us tonight.
Pooja has ordered so much! Look

164
00:17:10,089 --> 00:17:12,057
So much of food...?
What are you celebrating?

165
00:17:15,094 --> 00:17:16,061
Celebrating the job, of course!
- Job?

166
00:17:21,100 --> 00:17:23,068
Jobs, of course! lsn't it
my duty to get employment...

167
00:17:25,104 --> 00:17:27,106
to every poor man, where l am?
- You'll give me a job, won't you?

168
00:17:27,106 --> 00:17:29,074
Yes, l will. Good bye...
- All right... good-bye

169
00:17:33,112 --> 00:17:34,079
Don't forget it, okay?
- What are you doing?

170
00:17:36,115 --> 00:17:38,083
Amazing! Your first day at work
and you're already employing others!

171
00:17:41,120 --> 00:17:43,088
l said my sister has a large heart!
This is how you must always be Pooja!

172
00:17:44,123 --> 00:17:46,091
He's a good boy, although he's poor.
You must certainly give him a job.

173
00:17:48,127 --> 00:17:49,094
Oh sure

174
00:17:51,130 --> 00:17:52,097
God! He's driving me up the wall!

175
00:17:55,134 --> 00:17:57,102
l'll have to do something about him!
The bloody hanger-on!

176
00:18:18,157 --> 00:18:20,125
Sir, l've finished my work for the day.
Even the work for tomorrow

177
00:18:23,162 --> 00:18:25,130
l've even sent that
detailed fax

178
00:18:31,170 --> 00:18:32,137
ls this all?

179
00:18:42,181 --> 00:18:44,149
l have something to discuss.
- Speak

180
00:18:46,185 --> 00:18:48,153
l have a friend, sir.
He's very highly qualified

181
00:18:50,189 --> 00:18:52,157
He stands first in sports.
And he has no vices at all

182
00:18:55,194 --> 00:18:57,162
Well? What am l to do?

183
00:18:59,198 --> 00:19:01,166
Sir, could you give him a job?

184
00:19:02,201 --> 00:19:04,169
All right. Send him here right now.
l'll employ him

185
00:19:14,213 --> 00:19:15,180
What job are you
going to give him, sir?

186
00:19:17,216 --> 00:19:19,184
l'll fire you and hire him instead.
- What?

187
00:19:20,219 --> 00:19:21,186
lt isn't even a week since
you've joined this office...

188
00:19:23,222 --> 00:19:25,190
and you're already finding
other people jobs

189
00:19:26,225 --> 00:19:28,193
Work sincerely, if you wish to.
Else, l'll have to show you the door

190
00:19:39,238 --> 00:19:41,206
l'm late! lt's 9:00 already!
- lt's 9:00 ! l'm late!

191
00:19:46,245 --> 00:19:48,213
Why don't the two of you wake up
early, if you don't want to be late?

192
00:19:49,248 --> 00:19:50,215
You are both just the same!

193
00:19:54,253 --> 00:19:55,220
Where's my key now?
- l'm getting very late, brother

194
00:19:56,255 --> 00:19:58,223
Please drop me at the office.
- Are you mad, Pooja?

195
00:19:59,258 --> 00:20:02,227
My office is in this direction,
yours is in that! No way! lmpossible!

196
00:20:04,263 --> 00:20:06,231
Greetings, sir.
- Bhiku Singh? What're you doing here?

197
00:20:07,266 --> 00:20:08,233
Running an errand for the boss, sir.
- For C.P. ? l see

198
00:20:10,269 --> 00:20:12,237
Who's this?
- lt's my boss's car.

199
00:20:13,272 --> 00:20:15,240
He's going in the same direction.
Ask him to give me a lift

200
00:20:17,276 --> 00:20:20,245
Can you drop my sister at
Connaught Place, Bhiku Singh?

201
00:20:21,280 --> 00:20:22,247
Go on. Hurry up

202
00:20:40,299 --> 00:20:42,267
Pooja...?

203
00:20:53,312 --> 00:20:55,280
Poojaji! Listen to me!
One moment, please!

204
00:20:56,315 --> 00:20:57,282
One moment!

205
00:21:04,323 --> 00:21:05,290
Listen to me!

206
00:21:09,328 --> 00:21:10,295
One minute!

207
00:21:12,331 --> 00:21:14,299
At least roll down the window!

208
00:21:15,334 --> 00:21:18,303
lt's Shiv Kapoor!
l met you at the office, remember?

209
00:21:31,350 --> 00:21:34,319
Thank you, Bhiku Singh.
You may go

210
00:21:36,355 --> 00:21:38,323
Where did he spring from?

211
00:21:39,358 --> 00:21:42,327
l've been calling out to you and
you wouldn't even look back at me

212
00:21:43,362 --> 00:21:44,329
l've been following your car
on my bike

213
00:21:45,364 --> 00:21:47,332
Really?
- Oh yes. And how would you listen?

214
00:21:49,368 --> 00:21:51,336
lt's such a big car.
Fully air-conditioned

215
00:21:52,371 --> 00:21:54,339
Your windows were shut.
How can you be blamed?

216
00:21:55,374 --> 00:21:57,342
Well? What is it?
- Have you seen today's newspaper?

217
00:21:59,378 --> 00:22:01,346
Have you?
- What does it say?

218
00:22:02,381 --> 00:22:04,383
Your office has advertised again!
How could they, when you're around?

219
00:22:04,383 --> 00:22:07,352
Your Papa will once again get a call
and l'll lose my job, won't l?

220
00:22:09,388 --> 00:22:11,356
You're so naive.
You just don't understand

221
00:22:14,393 --> 00:22:16,361
To remain in circulation! One has
to do it to fool people. See?

222
00:22:18,397 --> 00:22:19,364
l see

223
00:22:23,402 --> 00:22:25,370
But why must you worry?
l'm very much here

224
00:22:26,405 --> 00:22:28,373
l've spoken to Papa.
Your job is confirmed

225
00:22:29,408 --> 00:22:31,376
Confirmed? May l meet him then?
- Meet Papa?

226
00:22:32,411 --> 00:22:33,378
Yes. l have an interview with him.
- Really?

227
00:22:34,413 --> 00:22:36,381
Listen, be very careful
during the interview

228
00:22:37,416 --> 00:22:39,384
Nobody must know that
l have recommended you.

229
00:22:40,419 --> 00:22:41,386
Or you'll lose the job.
Not even my Papa, okay?

230
00:22:42,421 --> 00:22:44,389
Go on now.
- May l?

231
00:22:46,425 --> 00:22:48,393
Be very careful

232
00:23:14,453 --> 00:23:16,421
You? What are you doing here?

233
00:23:17,456 --> 00:23:19,424
How did you get here?
- l found you at last, didn't l?

234
00:23:20,459 --> 00:23:22,427
Laddoos, Poojaji.
- How did you know l was here?

235
00:23:24,463 --> 00:23:26,431
When will your friends help?
Those Anju's and Sush's...

236
00:23:27,466 --> 00:23:30,435
you have an amazing friends' circle!
They were only too happy to tell me

237
00:23:31,470 --> 00:23:33,438
Laddoos...?
- Come to the point. What is it?

238
00:23:34,473 --> 00:23:36,441
Okay, where is your hand...?
- Let go! What are you up to?

239
00:23:40,479 --> 00:23:42,447
Ever since you shook
hands with me...

240
00:23:44,483 --> 00:23:46,451
my life has changed for the better.
- What happened?

241
00:23:49,488 --> 00:23:50,455
Your Papa has taken your advise

242
00:23:52,491 --> 00:23:53,458
He has employed me as
the General Manager!

243
00:23:54,493 --> 00:23:55,460
What? What are you talking about?

244
00:23:58,497 --> 00:24:00,465
Why're you so surprised?
You're the one who did it

245
00:24:02,501 --> 00:24:04,469
Have some laddoos, Poojaji.
Made with clarified-butter

246
00:24:08,507 --> 00:24:09,474
l bought them from Bengali Market.
Have some

247
00:24:10,509 --> 00:24:11,476
That's enough.
- Enough? Have a whole laddoo

248
00:24:12,511 --> 00:24:14,479
No, l don't have a whole laddoo.
- No? And l swallow half a dozen!

249
00:24:16,515 --> 00:24:18,483
Give some to your brother and...
- No. Not them!

250
00:24:19,518 --> 00:24:21,486
Why not? Give them some, too.
- Don't disturb them!

251
00:24:22,521 --> 00:24:24,489
Give them some...
- l've heard you talking, Shivji

252
00:24:27,526 --> 00:24:29,494
This is just what l
expected from you, Pooja

253
00:24:30,529 --> 00:24:32,497
You've got this capable boy
a job at last

254
00:24:33,532 --> 00:24:34,499
See what a large heart my sister has?
And you...

255
00:24:35,534 --> 00:24:38,503
Not just large-hearted...
she's a magnanimous Delhi-ite!

256
00:24:40,539 --> 00:24:42,507
Know what? You do have
a beautiful sister!

257
00:24:43,542 --> 00:24:45,510
Shut up, feller! And put
those laddoos away!

258
00:24:46,545 --> 00:24:48,513
Let me watch Aishwarya Rai!
- Don't be angry, Sardarji

259
00:24:49,548 --> 00:24:51,516
l've got a job today.
Have some laddoos.

260
00:24:52,551 --> 00:24:54,519
Congrats! l'll have two laddoos.
- One for me...!

261
00:25:09,568 --> 00:25:10,535
Congratulations, General Manager!

262
00:25:11,570 --> 00:25:15,529
This Hyderabadi will now treat you
to the most delectable food!

263
00:25:19,578 --> 00:25:21,546
Thanks a lot, my friend

264
00:25:22,581 --> 00:25:24,549
lt's only after l met you that
l embarked on this lovely journey

265
00:25:25,584 --> 00:25:29,543
Had you hung around the other day,
you wouldn't have got this post

266
00:25:30,589 --> 00:25:32,557
You'd have been hanging,
lower down in the ladder

267
00:25:33,592 --> 00:25:34,559
True. lt's all thanks to Poojaji

268
00:25:36,595 --> 00:25:37,562
As long as l live,
l'll worship only Pooja

269
00:25:39,598 --> 00:25:40,565
Pooja? Pooja who?
The manager?

270
00:25:43,602 --> 00:25:46,571
Come on! You're giving the employer
the status of an employee?

271
00:25:48,607 --> 00:25:51,576
This is the limit! Thanks to her,
so many poor guys have found jobs

272
00:25:53,612 --> 00:25:56,581
Take my case. Hadn't she put in a word
for me to her father, the employer...

273
00:25:57,616 --> 00:25:59,618
could we have been chatting in
this posh, air-conditioned office?

274
00:25:59,618 --> 00:26:00,585
What a shame! You're making
my head swim with rubbish

275
00:26:06,625 --> 00:26:08,593
That girl has made
a sucker out of you

276
00:26:09,628 --> 00:26:11,596
She got rid of you the other day
and snatched your job. That's it!

277
00:26:14,633 --> 00:26:16,601
What does that mean?
- l mean, she's just...

278
00:26:18,637 --> 00:26:19,604
an executive manager. Nothing else!

279
00:26:25,644 --> 00:26:29,603
Which means, the boss
isn't dear papa at all?

280
00:26:31,650 --> 00:26:33,618
Chopra, the old fossil,
is a rotten old fig!

281
00:26:35,654 --> 00:26:36,621
And he's still a bachelor!

282
00:26:38,657 --> 00:26:40,625
You mean Pooja didn't
recommend me at all?

283
00:26:41,660 --> 00:26:42,627
My dear naive boy!

284
00:26:46,665 --> 00:26:49,634
Recommend you? She's been
cutting you out all the way!

285
00:26:51,670 --> 00:26:52,637
Really? So she took me for a ride!
- Yes.

286
00:26:56,675 --> 00:26:57,642
And took me all over Delhi!
- Oh yes!

287
00:26:58,677 --> 00:26:59,644
She has turned out to be
quite an actress!

288
00:27:00,679 --> 00:27:02,647
Dil-phenk, call her immediately.
l'll fix her

289
00:27:05,684 --> 00:27:07,652
l'll call her. And you
must teach her a lesson

290
00:27:09,688 --> 00:27:10,655
lt's your right.
You're the General Manager!

291
00:27:11,690 --> 00:27:12,657
Let her come. l'll show her

292
00:27:13,692 --> 00:27:16,661
l'll teach her such a lesson, she'll
never think of conning anyone again

293
00:27:24,703 --> 00:27:25,670
Do come

294
00:27:26,705 --> 00:27:27,672
My word!

295
00:27:32,711 --> 00:27:34,679
Sit down. Why're you standing?
- How can l sit in your presence?

296
00:27:39,718 --> 00:27:40,685
You have done so much for me

297
00:27:42,721 --> 00:27:44,689
You took my destiny into your hands
and made my life

298
00:27:46,725 --> 00:27:48,693
You've recommended me to your Papa
at the breakfast table!

299
00:27:51,730 --> 00:27:53,698
l do that very often.
- ln a flying Mercedes car...

300
00:27:55,734 --> 00:27:58,703
you weren't thinking about yourself.
You thought of me

301
00:28:03,742 --> 00:28:06,711
lnstead of the Executive Manager,
you made me the General Manager!

302
00:28:11,750 --> 00:28:13,718
You're such a great person.
lt's amazing, Poojaji!

303
00:28:16,755 --> 00:28:18,723
Would you like to have some tea?
- Tea...?

304
00:28:27,766 --> 00:28:28,733
What...?

305
00:28:30,769 --> 00:28:31,736
You dare make a fool out of me?

306
00:28:34,773 --> 00:28:35,740
Shiv? Call me ''Sir'' !

307
00:28:39,778 --> 00:28:42,747
Poojaji! l went about worshipping you.
And you kept making a fool out of me!

308
00:28:47,786 --> 00:28:49,754
The pampered daughter of the
dear Papa...

309
00:28:50,789 --> 00:28:53,758
you're a sympathiser of the poor
and recommend them, don't you?

310
00:28:54,793 --> 00:28:56,761
You played around with me! You conned
me the first time we met...

311
00:28:58,797 --> 00:29:00,765
and walked away with my job!
And as if that wasn't enough...

312
00:29:01,800 --> 00:29:04,769
you polished off fancy delicacies with
your brother at the 5-star hotel!

313
00:29:10,809 --> 00:29:12,777
Like a madman, l went around Delhi
looking for you...

314
00:29:15,814 --> 00:29:17,782
and you were sitting in the theater,
watching the latest movie!

315
00:29:19,818 --> 00:29:21,786
And l still got laddoos made
for a stone-hearted girl like you!

316
00:29:22,821 --> 00:29:24,789
With clarified-butter!
So tell me now, Poojaji...

317
00:29:28,827 --> 00:29:31,796
what am l to do with you?
Must l kill you? Or let you go?

318
00:29:32,831 --> 00:29:33,798
Tell me

319
00:29:35,834 --> 00:29:38,803
l agree to any punishment you
hand out to me, Mr General Manager

320
00:29:44,843 --> 00:29:46,811
Will you do as l say?
- Yes, l will

321
00:29:49,848 --> 00:29:51,816
Will you marry me?
- Yes, l will

322
00:30:16,875 --> 00:30:18,843
''The way you look,
tells me...''

323
00:30:25,884 --> 00:30:26,851
''l'm the one you love''

324
00:30:32,891 --> 00:30:34,859
''The way you talk,
tells me...''

325
00:30:40,899 --> 00:30:42,867
''l'm the one you could die for''

326
00:30:49,908 --> 00:30:51,876
''l'd teach you the way of loving...''

327
00:30:53,912 --> 00:30:55,880
''and lay down my life for you,
my love''

328
00:30:57,916 --> 00:30:59,884
''You set my heart racing,
you taught me lessons in love...''

329
00:31:02,921 --> 00:31:04,889
''you have accepted me,
you're my crazy lover''

330
00:31:06,925 --> 00:31:08,893
''We have taken a vow...
we will never part''

331
00:32:11,990 --> 00:32:13,958
''This is a new story,
this is a new friendship''

332
00:32:18,997 --> 00:32:20,965
''This is my first love...
you're my first beloved''

333
00:32:27,005 --> 00:32:28,973
''Under the blue skies,
two young hearts meet in love''

334
00:32:38,016 --> 00:32:39,984
''The way you breathe,
it tells me...''

335
00:32:46,024 --> 00:32:46,991
''l'm the one you love''

336
00:32:55,033 --> 00:32:57,001
''The way you lurch forth,
it tells me...''

337
00:33:04,042 --> 00:33:06,010
''l'm the one you could die for''

338
00:33:32,070 --> 00:33:34,038
''l'm not in my senses;
you realise nothing''

339
00:33:39,077 --> 00:33:41,045
''lt's the effect my love
has had on you''

340
00:33:47,085 --> 00:33:49,053
''Let's lose ourselves
in each other...''

341
00:33:53,091 --> 00:33:55,059
''so that no one in the world
can ever see us''

342
00:33:57,095 --> 00:33:59,063
''Every secret of your dreams
tells me...''

343
00:34:08,106 --> 00:34:09,073
''l'm the one you love''

344
00:34:16,114 --> 00:34:18,082
''The way you embrace me, tells
me..''

345
00:34:23,121 --> 00:34:25,089
''l'm the one you
could die for''

346
00:34:30,128 --> 00:34:31,095
''l'd teach you the way to love...''

347
00:34:36,134 --> 00:34:38,102
''and lay down my life
for you, my love''

348
00:34:40,138 --> 00:34:42,106
''You set my heart beating,
you taught me lessons in love...''

349
00:34:43,141 --> 00:34:45,109
''you have accepted me,
you're my crazy lover''

350
00:34:49,147 --> 00:34:51,115
''We have sworn, we have vowed...
never to part''

351
00:36:08,226 --> 00:36:10,194
lt's morning already.
But your mischief isn't over

352
00:36:12,230 --> 00:36:14,198
Don't ruin the General Manager's
mood, okay?

353
00:36:20,238 --> 00:36:22,206
l'm the only General Manager
in this house!

354
00:36:24,242 --> 00:36:26,210
l didn't deny that. You're the
General Manager of my heart too.

355
00:36:30,248 --> 00:36:31,215
lt's amazing! l sometimes wonder...

356
00:36:34,252 --> 00:36:35,219
how l could to sleep alone
all these years.

357
00:36:37,255 --> 00:36:39,223
What must the poor bachelors
be going through?

358
00:36:41,259 --> 00:36:43,227
Are wives meant only for this?
You men are all alike!

359
00:36:45,263 --> 00:36:47,231
You just won't improve.
- lf we improve, madam...

360
00:36:48,266 --> 00:36:50,234
what happens of you women?
- lt's pointless arguing with you

361
00:36:52,270 --> 00:36:54,238
Get up now, bathe
and leave for work

362
00:36:55,273 --> 00:36:56,240
Or we won't even have this house
the company has given us

363
00:36:57,275 --> 00:36:58,242
Get up...
- No

364
00:37:00,278 --> 00:37:01,245
Must l go to the office today?
- l've given up the job

365
00:37:04,282 --> 00:37:07,285
lf you don't go to work,
what will we live on?

366
00:37:07,285 --> 00:37:10,254
Simple. We'll live on love and air.
l'll eat you up too!

367
00:37:11,289 --> 00:37:13,257
This is my right!
- No rights. Just get up

368
00:37:15,293 --> 00:37:16,260
See who's at the door...
go on!

369
00:37:18,296 --> 00:37:19,263
Get up, please!

370
00:37:25,303 --> 00:37:26,270
You're very lazy! Get up and go.
@ 02/05/11902

371
00:37:34,312 --> 00:37:35,279
Who are you?

372
00:37:48,326 --> 00:37:50,294
Milk!
- What?

373
00:37:51,329 --> 00:37:53,297
l'm the milkmaid, sir.
My name is Kismis

374
00:37:58,336 --> 00:37:59,303
Take it

375
00:38:04,342 --> 00:38:05,309
How much?

376
00:38:07,345 --> 00:38:10,314
Accounts are settled at
the end of the month, sir

377
00:38:13,351 --> 00:38:16,320
You're a newcomer?
- Yes. We're newcomers

378
00:38:17,355 --> 00:38:20,324
So tell me... is one packet enough?
Or must l give more?

379
00:38:24,362 --> 00:38:25,329
One should be enough. Why?

380
00:38:28,366 --> 00:38:31,335
l ask, because people in this
building use lots of milk

381
00:38:34,372 --> 00:38:37,341
One is enough.
- l'll leave then, sir

382
00:38:46,384 --> 00:38:48,352
l say, sir...
- What?

383
00:38:50,388 --> 00:38:52,356
Lend me a hand.
- What?

384
00:38:54,392 --> 00:38:57,361
With this burden.
- Sure. One moment

385
00:39:02,400 --> 00:39:04,368
God! l've been had!

386
00:39:07,405 --> 00:39:09,373
May l say something, sir?
- Go ahead

387
00:39:10,408 --> 00:39:13,377
You're a very decent man.
A very nice gentleman

388
00:39:15,413 --> 00:39:18,382
You have a handsome face...
you worthy of befriending, sir

389
00:39:21,419 --> 00:39:23,387
Really?
- Oh yes. May l leave, friend?

390
00:39:28,426 --> 00:39:29,393
Tomorrow morning then

391
00:39:40,438 --> 00:39:42,406
Has the friend left?

392
00:39:45,443 --> 00:39:48,412
Yes, she has.
lt was the milkmaid

393
00:39:49,447 --> 00:39:52,416
So it's going to take so much of
time to fetch milk every morning?

394
00:39:54,452 --> 00:39:56,420
You could've seen her off downstairs.
- l was only helping her...

395
00:39:57,455 --> 00:40:00,424
and what are you thinking about?
A milkmaid and l...? C'mon Pooja!

396
00:40:01,459 --> 00:40:05,418
l know you men very well.
Give me the milk

397
00:40:08,466 --> 00:40:10,434
First give me what is mine

398
00:40:12,470 --> 00:40:13,437
What?

399
00:40:15,473 --> 00:40:18,442
This lungi and kurta you're
wearing, are mine

400
00:40:19,477 --> 00:40:22,446
Go on. Take it off.
- Come inside. l'll give it to you

401
00:40:25,483 --> 00:40:26,450
Now. Right now

402
00:40:30,488 --> 00:40:33,457
Have you gone mad...?
People are watching!

403
00:40:37,495 --> 00:40:38,462
Let me go!

404
00:40:50,508 --> 00:40:53,477
Shiv, l'm going to take the
milk from tomorrow. Not you

405
00:41:05,523 --> 00:41:08,492
This is funny. He calls us here
and doesn't turn up himself

406
00:41:09,527 --> 00:41:11,495
l can't understand why he said,
we mustn't tell Pooja

407
00:41:15,533 --> 00:41:17,501
They haven't had a fight, have they?
Your sister always itches for a fight

408
00:41:18,536 --> 00:41:20,504
Not more than you do.
- Taking up for your sister again?

409
00:41:21,539 --> 00:41:24,508
She's lucky to have found a
husband like him in such times

410
00:41:25,543 --> 00:41:26,510
Here he is

411
00:41:27,545 --> 00:41:28,512
Sorry, folks

412
00:41:30,548 --> 00:41:31,515
Can't help this Delhi traffic.
l'd have zoomed in on a bike

413
00:41:32,550 --> 00:41:34,518
Ever since l got this car,
l get stuck everywhere

414
00:41:35,553 --> 00:41:38,522
What is the secret that you call us
here without even telling Pooja?

415
00:41:39,557 --> 00:41:41,525
What's the day today?
- 15th of December

416
00:41:42,560 --> 00:41:44,528
And tomorrow?
- The 16th of December. So what?

417
00:41:45,563 --> 00:41:47,531
What, eh? You forget it, after
all the years she spent with you?

418
00:41:48,566 --> 00:41:50,534
And l remember everything in
just a few months with her

419
00:41:51,569 --> 00:41:53,537
Tomorrow's Pooja birthday.
- l know. So listen...

420
00:41:54,572 --> 00:41:57,541
We'll first buy a huge cake.
We'll pack some food...

421
00:42:01,579 --> 00:42:05,538
buy lots of balloons and gifts
and surprise her at midnight!

422
00:42:08,586 --> 00:42:11,555
And l thought my husband had
brought me out to the amusement park

423
00:42:12,590 --> 00:42:15,559
l'm not leaving without
sitting on the giant-wheel

424
00:42:18,596 --> 00:42:19,563
As if it's your age
to sit on the giant-wheel

425
00:42:20,598 --> 00:42:22,566
What...?
- No age-bar to enjoy life

426
00:42:24,602 --> 00:42:25,569
We'll do just as your wife says

427
00:42:28,606 --> 00:42:31,575
Come on, brother.
- lt's very high! l'm not sitting in it

428
00:42:34,612 --> 00:42:36,580
Come on...
- No! l'm scared, Shiv!

429
00:42:37,615 --> 00:42:39,583
Go with her instead.
- No. The couple sit together

430
00:42:41,619 --> 00:42:43,587
Come on...
- Are you coming too?

431
00:42:44,622 --> 00:42:45,589
lf l don't come back alive,
look after my bitch

432
00:42:46,624 --> 00:42:49,593
What rubbish! Come!
- Look after my Kittu!

433
00:42:54,632 --> 00:42:57,601
Not too high, mister.
l'm scared

434
00:44:32,730 --> 00:44:34,698
What happened? Why's it jammed?
- Don't worry

435
00:44:37,735 --> 00:44:40,704
lt'll start up again. Enjoy the sight
of Delhi from this height, my love!

436
00:44:50,748 --> 00:44:51,715
Let's spend the night chatting

437
00:44:59,757 --> 00:45:01,725
Will you be my friend?

438
00:45:03,761 --> 00:45:06,730
My name is Shiv Kapoor.
l have a wife. A missus

439
00:45:10,768 --> 00:45:12,736
Her name is Pooja

440
00:45:17,775 --> 00:45:19,743
Pooja, my darling wife

441
00:45:25,783 --> 00:45:27,751
l say, brother-in-law...
- Yes?

442
00:45:31,789 --> 00:45:33,757
lt's already midnight, l say

443
00:45:35,793 --> 00:45:36,760
Oh yes. All the way

444
00:45:42,800 --> 00:45:44,768
Today's your wife's birthday?

445
00:45:51,809 --> 00:45:54,778
But it's so sad.
You're stuck here... with me

446
00:46:05,823 --> 00:46:07,791
Looks like they're fixing it

447
00:46:08,826 --> 00:46:11,795
l wonder how many more jolts
l'm going to get tonight

448
00:46:14,832 --> 00:46:17,801
Oh yes. l don't know how many jolts
this husband will take tonight!

449
00:46:59,877 --> 00:47:01,845
Where were you?

450
00:47:05,883 --> 00:47:07,851
First tell me where you were.
- l'll tell you. l'll explain

451
00:47:08,886 --> 00:47:11,855
l know you will believe what l say.
- Now tell me the truth...

452
00:47:13,891 --> 00:47:16,860
only the truth. Speak up!
- l was in the office all night

453
00:47:19,897 --> 00:47:22,866
There was something only l could do.
l knew it was your birthday...

454
00:47:23,901 --> 00:47:25,869
but l couldn't disobey the boss.
- Really?

455
00:47:27,905 --> 00:47:30,874
But l kept calling the office
all night. Nobody took the call

456
00:47:33,911 --> 00:47:36,880
All the lines were disconnected.
They were held up

457
00:47:37,915 --> 00:47:40,884
lt was as if l was in the skies
and you were here, on earth

458
00:47:43,921 --> 00:47:45,889
Who baked it?
- l did

459
00:47:46,924 --> 00:47:48,892
Shall we cut it?
- No

460
00:47:49,927 --> 00:47:52,896
Do you think l'll give in so easily?
lt's a nice story...

461
00:47:55,933 --> 00:47:58,902
but what is the truth? Tell me.
You're not having a fling, are you?

462
00:48:00,938 --> 00:49:03,959
What rubbish! Do l want
to have a fling and die?

463
00:49:09,006 --> 00:49:09,973
Are you angry?

464
00:49:12,009 --> 00:49:13,977
l flared up on you without
even thinking, didn't l?

465
00:49:16,013 --> 00:49:16,980
Forgive me... l'm sorry

466
00:49:21,018 --> 00:49:21,985
All right

467
00:49:24,021 --> 00:49:25,989
l don't like you suspecting me
all the time

468
00:49:28,025 --> 00:49:30,994
After all, how much will a man
convince you? You must trust me...

469
00:49:37,034 --> 00:49:40,003
My sulking lover...
you're angry, are you?

470
00:49:42,039 --> 00:49:45,008
l get all rotten ideas. l have
brains that work over-time, don't l?

471
00:49:49,046 --> 00:49:51,014
All right... what's happened
is in the past

472
00:49:52,049 --> 00:49:55,018
Today's your birthday, isn't it?
So this evening, is solely for you

473
00:49:59,056 --> 00:50:02,025
We'll dance, make merry,
eat and drink

474
00:50:05,062 --> 00:50:06,029
And make love

475
00:50:09,066 --> 00:50:10,033
May l go and take some rest now?
l'm exhausted

476
00:50:11,068 --> 00:50:12,035
Go on

477
00:50:23,080 --> 00:50:25,048
lt's nice... and different

478
00:50:38,095 --> 00:50:41,064
lt's work, day in and day out!
Who have you been talking to?

479
00:50:42,099 --> 00:50:43,066
Your boss-papa

480
00:50:44,101 --> 00:50:46,069
He's sending me to a conference.
- When are you leaving?

481
00:50:49,106 --> 00:50:52,075
l'm not going alone.
You're going with me too

482
00:50:54,111 --> 00:50:56,079
What does that mean?
- lt means...

483
00:50:57,114 --> 00:51:00,083
what every lndian dreams of...
destination Switzerland

484
00:51:05,122 --> 00:51:07,090
Switzerland? Really?

485
00:51:08,125 --> 00:51:10,093
Of course. Your boss-papa is sending me
there to attend a conference

486
00:51:16,133 --> 00:51:19,102
you and l, will celebrate
a delayed-honeymoon

487
00:51:21,138 --> 00:51:23,106
Shiv, see how lucky my birthday is?
Just wait and watch

488
00:51:24,141 --> 00:51:26,109
There's going to be an explosion
every second!

489
00:51:28,145 --> 00:51:30,113
My God! l find you here!

490
00:51:35,152 --> 00:51:38,121
l was wondering where l'd find you.
And here you are

491
00:51:41,158 --> 00:51:44,127
lt's Laila! Shiv, have you
forgotten me in just a night?

492
00:51:50,167 --> 00:51:52,135
Pooja? Your wife?

493
00:51:56,173 --> 00:51:58,141
Celebrating your birthday, l see

494
00:51:59,176 --> 00:52:02,145
We celebrated it last night

495
00:52:05,182 --> 00:52:08,151
The two of us were stuck
up there, in the darkness

496
00:52:15,192 --> 00:52:18,161
Shiv, in the confusion of
the darkness night...

497
00:52:21,198 --> 00:52:24,167
l think my diamond-watch
slipped over to you

498
00:52:26,203 --> 00:52:28,171
Did you find it?

499
00:52:37,214 --> 00:52:38,181
Yes, he did. Certainly.

500
00:52:40,217 --> 00:52:43,186
Your watch is with me.
This is the one, isn't it?

501
00:52:50,227 --> 00:52:53,196
This diamond-watch
is terribly expensive

502
00:52:55,232 --> 00:52:57,200
So l was scared.
- l was looking for you too

503
00:52:59,236 --> 00:53:01,204
l wondered how l would
return to you, what is yours

504
00:53:04,241 --> 00:53:06,209
Shiv, may we return her thing to her?

505
00:53:08,245 --> 00:53:10,213
l've got my precious watch!

506
00:53:21,258 --> 00:53:22,225
Listen to me, okay...

507
00:53:24,261 --> 00:53:27,230
Hear me out, Pooja.
- What's there to say or listen to?

508
00:53:34,271 --> 00:53:36,239
Maybe you're making a mistake, Pooja.
Maybe it's something else...

509
00:53:37,274 --> 00:53:40,243
Shiv could explain only if you're
prepared to listen, isn't it?

510
00:53:43,280 --> 00:53:45,248
What will he explain to me?
l've met the girl...

511
00:53:46,283 --> 00:53:48,251
he spent the whole night with!
l'll never forgive him!

512
00:53:50,287 --> 00:53:52,255
Whatever happens, l'm not
going back to him!

513
00:53:53,290 --> 00:53:55,258
Enough! You break your relationship
for every little thing?

514
00:53:56,293 --> 00:53:58,261
You're willing to walk out
of your house for nothing?

515
00:53:59,296 --> 00:54:01,264
This isn't how you go through life.
Marriage is no child-play...

516
00:54:02,299 --> 00:54:05,268
that you blow a thing like this
out of proportion, Pooja

517
00:54:06,303 --> 00:54:08,271
Listen to the truth, if you must.
Shiv called us to the fair...

518
00:54:09,306 --> 00:54:12,275
to prepare for a surprise
birthday party for you

519
00:54:13,310 --> 00:54:15,278
l insisted on sitting on the
giant-wheel and the poor man agreed

520
00:54:16,313 --> 00:54:18,281
Our misfortune! The giant-wheel
broke down...

521
00:54:20,317 --> 00:54:21,284
and we had to spend
an entire night in it!

522
00:54:22,319 --> 00:54:23,286
When we got down, Shiv requested us
not to tell you...

523
00:54:26,323 --> 00:54:28,291
that he had spent the night
sitting with another girl

524
00:54:29,326 --> 00:54:32,295
He said Pooja wouldn't be able
to take it. And he was right too!

525
00:54:33,330 --> 00:54:35,298
He was right. You have done
just what he expected you to do!

526
00:54:37,334 --> 00:54:39,302
lf you have any sense,
go back to your husband...

527
00:54:40,337 --> 00:54:41,304
seek his forgiveness
and bring him around!

528
00:54:42,339 --> 00:54:44,307
Not at all

529
00:54:45,342 --> 00:54:48,311
Pooja does not need to seek
my forgiveness

530
00:54:53,350 --> 00:54:56,319
She need not apologise to me.
lt's enough that she loves me so much

531
00:55:04,361 --> 00:55:07,330
And yes, she has a very
unique way of loving me

532
00:55:11,368 --> 00:55:13,336
And this is what l'm crazy about

533
00:55:16,373 --> 00:55:18,341
l know it, Pooja. More than the
amount of anguish you cause me...

534
00:55:23,380 --> 00:55:25,348
you feel tormented yourself.

535
00:55:28,385 --> 00:55:30,353
More than you make me ache...
you ache too

536
00:55:37,394 --> 00:55:40,363
All this, only because
you love me so much

537
00:55:46,403 --> 00:55:48,371
But l have loved you too, Pooja

538
00:55:52,409 --> 00:55:54,377
l have loved you too

539
00:56:04,421 --> 00:56:06,389
''l'm your love,
my heart beats for you...''

540
00:56:18,435 --> 00:56:20,403
''do always be with me''

541
00:56:31,448 --> 00:56:33,416
''l'm your love,
my heart beats for you...''

542
00:56:39,456 --> 00:56:41,424
''do always be with me''

543
00:56:57,474 --> 00:56:59,442
''Should you have any
grouse against me...''

544
00:57:02,479 --> 00:57:05,448
''do always tell me''

545
00:57:08,485 --> 00:57:10,453
''l have loved you too, my love''

546
00:57:16,493 --> 00:57:18,461
''Yes, l have loved you too''

547
00:57:21,498 --> 00:57:24,467
''l'm your love,
my heart beats for you...''

548
00:57:26,503 --> 00:57:28,471
''do always be with me''

549
00:57:32,509 --> 00:57:35,478
''Should you have any
grouse against me...''

550
00:57:37,514 --> 00:57:39,482
''do always tell me''

551
00:57:45,522 --> 00:57:47,490
''l have loved you too, my love''

552
00:57:50,527 --> 00:57:52,495
''Yes, l have loved you too''

553
00:58:46,583 --> 00:58:49,552
''The way you drop your tresses,
and lower your gaze...''

554
00:58:52,589 --> 00:58:54,557
''where did you learn this spell from?''

555
00:58:58,595 --> 00:59:00,563
''You too have a way with words''

556
00:59:06,603 --> 00:59:08,571
''Go on... stop pestering me''

557
00:59:24,621 --> 00:59:27,590
''Passions are taking over...
my yearning is getting worse''

558
00:59:30,627 --> 00:59:33,596
''don't giggle and make it worse''

559
00:59:36,633 --> 00:59:38,601
''Should you have any
grouse against me...''

560
00:59:42,639 --> 00:59:44,607
''do always tell me''

561
01:00:55,712 --> 01:00:57,680
''You're as mischievious
as a madman...''

562
01:01:02,719 --> 01:01:04,687
''but l know the truth
about your heart''

563
01:01:21,738 --> 01:01:24,707
''Don't you understand what
the climes tell us...?''

564
01:01:27,744 --> 01:01:28,711
''We can't do on our own anymore''

565
01:01:45,762 --> 01:01:47,730
''Don't take such a deep breath,
be not so naughty...''

566
01:01:53,770 --> 01:01:54,737
''don't be stubborn''

567
01:01:58,775 --> 01:02:00,743
''Should you have any
grouse against me...''

568
01:02:05,782 --> 01:02:06,749
''do always tell me''

569
01:02:11,788 --> 01:02:13,756
''l'm your love,
my heart beats for you...''

570
01:02:17,794 --> 01:02:19,762
''do always be with me''

571
01:02:50,827 --> 01:02:52,795
Yes, l have loved you too

572
01:03:13,850 --> 01:03:15,818
How will l spend
the entire day without you?

573
01:03:17,854 --> 01:03:19,822
You know l'm here for the conference.
lt's only till this evening

574
01:03:21,858 --> 01:03:23,826
l'll be back in a jiffy.
Go shopping till then

575
01:03:24,861 --> 01:03:26,829
Eat and go to sleep.
And dream of me

576
01:03:39,876 --> 01:03:41,844
You're the one who's giving me
a surprise. lt must be...

577
01:03:43,880 --> 01:03:45,848
5 years since college and
when we last met, right?

578
01:03:46,883 --> 01:03:47,850
Really? ls it so long already?

579
01:03:49,886 --> 01:03:51,854
Pooja, this is Meghna.
We studied together in college

580
01:03:58,895 --> 01:04:00,863
Know what, Pooja? Shiv was the
most handsome guy in college

581
01:04:07,904 --> 01:04:09,872
his studies and sports.
But now that l see you, l must say...

582
01:04:13,910 --> 01:04:15,878
he does have a great choice.
You're the one he finally chose

583
01:04:19,916 --> 01:04:21,884
Don't believe her, Pooja.
Meghna was a brilliant student too

584
01:04:22,919 --> 01:04:24,887
She always had a way with words

585
01:04:26,923 --> 01:04:28,891
What are you doing in Switzerland?
- l came on business

586
01:04:32,929 --> 01:04:34,897
ln fact, l must leave now
or l'll get late

587
01:04:37,934 --> 01:04:38,901
You're put up at this hotel, right?

588
01:04:40,937 --> 01:04:42,905
Why don't we have dinner together?

589
01:04:45,942 --> 01:04:47,910
So tonight will be an amazing night

590
01:04:56,953 --> 01:04:58,921
l'm glad you like some girl at least

591
01:05:01,958 --> 01:05:03,926
Hurry up and go now.
And come back soon

592
01:05:04,961 --> 01:05:06,929
Come on, you've got to get ready

593
01:05:20,977 --> 01:05:22,945
What's up, Meghna?
- My car has broken down

594
01:05:25,982 --> 01:05:27,950
Where have you to go?
- To Geneva. To attend a seminar

595
01:05:29,986 --> 01:05:31,954
Life sure is a co-incidence!
l have a conference in Geneva too

596
01:05:32,989 --> 01:05:33,956
Come, l'll give you a ride

597
01:05:34,991 --> 01:05:36,959
How about my return?
- l've got to return to the hotel too

598
01:05:37,994 --> 01:05:38,961
We'll come back together

599
01:06:17,033 --> 01:06:19,001
You can talk to me in Hindi.
l'm an lndian, Madam

600
01:06:24,040 --> 01:06:26,008
Do you have a bigger model
of that beautiful house?

601
01:06:27,043 --> 01:06:28,010
l want a bigger one.

602
01:06:29,045 --> 01:06:30,012
Not right now.
You can have it tomorrow.

603
01:06:31,047 --> 01:06:33,015
All right then. l'll give you an
advance now and pick it up tomorrow

604
01:06:34,050 --> 01:06:36,018
At what time tomorrow?
- 10:00 a.m. Sharp

605
01:06:38,054 --> 01:06:39,021
Namaste.
- Namaste

606
01:07:02,078 --> 01:07:04,046
Absent-minded professor!
You're still forgetful

607
01:07:08,084 --> 01:07:09,051
ls your work over?
- Yes. And yours?

608
01:07:10,086 --> 01:07:12,054
Yes. Shall we leave now?
- Let's return. Rouge Mont

609
01:07:13,089 --> 01:07:15,057
lt'll take us 3 or 4 hours

610
01:07:19,095 --> 01:07:21,063
l still can't believe how absent
minded you are. You haven't changed

611
01:07:36,112 --> 01:07:38,080
Looks like there's a problem

612
01:07:47,123 --> 01:07:49,091
Shiv! How much time will it take?

613
01:07:56,132 --> 01:07:59,101
7 or 8 hours? l'll freeze
to death in the car!

614
01:08:01,137 --> 01:08:03,105
Ask him if there is a place
we can spend time at

615
01:08:24,160 --> 01:08:26,128
l suggest l ring up Pooja and
tell her that we're held up here

616
01:08:53,189 --> 01:08:55,157
The phone had to disconnect now!

617
01:09:03,199 --> 01:09:04,166
What happened?
- The line got disconnected

618
01:09:14,210 --> 01:09:16,178
Let me try and make that call.
You go and change

619
01:09:17,213 --> 01:09:19,181
lf something happens to you,
your wife is going to kill me

620
01:09:23,219 --> 01:09:24,186
''Where have we landed...?''

621
01:09:52,248 --> 01:09:54,216
Why're you laughing?
- Why? Look at you!

622
01:09:56,252 --> 01:09:58,220
You look crazy! l mean...
you look like a mad gypsy!

623
01:10:00,256 --> 01:10:02,224
Remember when you played mad gypsy?
- l did? When?

624
01:10:03,259 --> 01:10:06,228
ln college, of course!
Have you forgotten?

625
01:10:07,263 --> 01:10:09,231
How we danced during that
inter-collegiate competition

626
01:11:55,371 --> 01:11:57,339
You aren't to be blamed
for what happened, Shiv

627
01:12:02,378 --> 01:12:04,346
What happened between us
was just an accident

628
01:12:15,391 --> 01:12:17,359
You mustn't think l will interfere
in your life, Shiv...

629
01:12:19,395 --> 01:12:21,363
or that l will pose
any difficulty for you

630
01:12:27,403 --> 01:12:29,371
And why must you hold
only yourself responsible?

631
01:12:33,409 --> 01:12:35,377
l played an equal part in it

632
01:12:39,415 --> 01:12:41,383
Shiv, l want this to remain
a secret between you and me

633
01:12:48,424 --> 01:12:49,391
So l'm leaving

634
01:12:57,433 --> 01:12:58,400
We will never meet again

635
01:13:01,437 --> 01:13:03,405
We will never meet again

636
01:13:12,448 --> 01:13:13,415
Not a thought for me!

637
01:13:17,453 --> 01:13:18,420
Do you have any defense for
the mistake you have made?

638
01:13:19,455 --> 01:13:21,423
Will you ever be able to alleviate
the agony you have caused to me?

639
01:13:24,460 --> 01:13:25,427
Will you ever...?

640
01:13:27,463 --> 01:13:29,431
Let me ask you. Had l made
the mistake you have made...

641
01:13:31,467 --> 01:13:33,435
would you ever have forgiven me?
Answer me!

642
01:13:35,471 --> 01:13:36,438
Would you forgive me?

643
01:13:37,473 --> 01:13:39,441
Do you have an answer...?
Speak up!

644
01:13:45,481 --> 01:13:47,449
You don't, do you?
You can't!

645
01:13:49,485 --> 01:13:50,452
You can't have an answer
for such a grave sin!

646
01:13:51,487 --> 01:13:52,454
There can be no pardon

647
01:13:55,491 --> 01:13:57,459
You and l cannot live
under the same roof anymore

648
01:13:58,494 --> 01:13:59,461
We can't spend our lives
together anymore!

649
01:14:01,497 --> 01:14:02,464
l will never forgive you!
The faith and trust l had in you...

650
01:14:06,502 --> 01:14:08,470
You must regret your mistake
all your life

651
01:14:11,507 --> 01:14:13,475
You must pay a price
for betraying my trust

652
01:15:21,577 --> 01:15:22,544
l want Divorce

653
01:15:24,580 --> 01:15:25,547
Divorce!

654
01:15:36,592 --> 01:15:38,560
''Yes, l have loved you too''

655
01:16:12,653 --> 01:16:14,621
lt's like this, Pooja. You've been
through so much, if you think of it

656
01:16:17,658 --> 01:16:19,626
But you've been through nothing,
if you don't think about it

657
01:16:20,661 --> 01:16:22,629
You have been courageous
in taking this step

658
01:16:25,666 --> 01:16:27,634
Maybe you've done the right thing
by not staying with your brother

659
01:16:29,670 --> 01:16:31,638
You haven't made your problems
the cause of their worry

660
01:16:34,675 --> 01:16:36,643
Problems and sorrows
are all part of life

661
01:16:42,683 --> 01:16:44,651
So why shouldn't a woman
face them...

662
01:16:47,688 --> 01:16:49,656
move forward, and shape
her own destiny?

663
01:16:56,697 --> 01:16:58,665
You don't have to tell anyone here
that you were married

664
01:17:01,702 --> 01:17:03,670
Or that you have had a divorce

665
01:17:04,705 --> 01:17:06,673
You know how people view a
woman who has been divorced

666
01:17:11,712 --> 01:17:13,680
But this is the city of Mumbai
in which you have arrived

667
01:17:16,717 --> 01:17:18,685
Nobody here cares for
the past lives of others

668
01:17:20,721 --> 01:17:22,689
People come here to start
life afresh

669
01:17:25,726 --> 01:17:27,694
There's no saying when and where
you will come across a messiah

670
01:17:34,735 --> 01:17:36,703
Neha, l couldn't even dream of finding
a nice friend like you so soon

671
01:17:48,749 --> 01:17:50,717
Now that you're with me,
l will surely find a way

672
01:17:53,754 --> 01:17:55,722
So be courageous. Make the attempt,
and l'll do my best too...

673
01:17:57,758 --> 01:17:58,725
to find you a job. Okay?

674
01:18:11,772 --> 01:18:12,739
God! You're great

675
01:18:16,777 --> 01:18:18,745
l wish every designer
was like you

676
01:18:19,780 --> 01:18:20,747
You're a magician... a wizard

677
01:18:24,785 --> 01:18:26,753
Neha, l mean it. Your boss
is the Designer Number One!

678
01:18:32,793 --> 01:18:34,761
Look, l'm so beautiful.
Like Pui Bawla

679
01:18:37,798 --> 01:18:39,766
Am l not right?
- Who's Pui Bawla?

680
01:18:42,803 --> 01:18:44,771
Pui Bawla...? Don't you know?
She's the Heroine Number One!

681
01:18:48,809 --> 01:18:49,776
l see

682
01:18:52,813 --> 01:18:54,781
Bunty must also be designing
Pui Bawla's costumes, right?

683
01:18:55,816 --> 01:18:56,783
Yes.
- He must be, of course!

684
01:18:59,820 --> 01:19:01,788
A film star, after all. Obviously,
he must be giving her all his time

685
01:19:03,824 --> 01:19:05,792
That's just what l hate about him

686
01:19:06,827 --> 01:19:07,794
During the awards
function last year,...

687
01:19:08,829 --> 01:19:10,797
he designed the clothes
for Heroine No 1

688
01:19:12,833 --> 01:19:13,800
He's always designing clothes
for film stars

689
01:19:14,835 --> 01:19:15,802
Do we society women
lack something?

690
01:19:17,838 --> 01:19:19,806
What do these film stars
have at all? What?

691
01:19:23,844 --> 01:19:25,812
What happened?
- The film folks are coming

692
01:19:27,848 --> 01:19:28,815
They'll take offence

693
01:19:32,853 --> 01:19:34,821
Who's that?
- Raj Malhotra, the film star

694
01:19:37,858 --> 01:19:39,826
They're on his staff.
- Hello, Nehaji

695
01:19:40,861 --> 01:19:42,829
Are our leading man's dresses ready?
- l was waiting for you, Babban Miyan

696
01:19:45,866 --> 01:19:47,834
The costumes for the hero's
dance sequence are ready

697
01:19:48,869 --> 01:19:50,837
God! So many costumes
for a single song...?

698
01:19:54,875 --> 01:19:56,843
They must be changing behind trees!

699
01:19:58,879 --> 01:20:00,847
Their tastes in eating, dressing et al!
Everything is so loud!

700
01:20:04,885 --> 01:20:06,853
Why must one leading man need
so many people on his staff?

701
01:20:08,889 --> 01:20:10,857
They're show-offs! Just show-offs!
- Watch your tongue...

702
01:20:12,893 --> 01:20:13,860
lest my heart pops out
of my chest

703
01:20:14,895 --> 01:20:16,863
Who's this lady without
any control on her tongue?

704
01:20:19,900 --> 01:20:21,868
Who's this female?
l could deliver a stinging slap!

705
01:20:24,905 --> 01:20:26,873
No... it's Mrs Chana Singh. Wife of
leading industrialist, Ghana Singh

706
01:20:29,910 --> 01:20:30,877
Wife? ls this how wives are?

707
01:20:32,913 --> 01:20:34,881
What's wrong with her husband? How
could he swallow such a big snake?

708
01:20:36,917 --> 01:20:38,885
Ask him to send her around in a burqa!
Anyone who sees her, will die!

709
01:20:42,923 --> 01:20:44,891
You're scaring us with your looks.
What's all that?

710
01:20:46,927 --> 01:20:48,895
What's he saying?
- Shut up, you lame horse!

711
01:20:51,932 --> 01:20:53,900
You wear this weird make up and pass
comments on your hero's costumes?

712
01:20:58,939 --> 01:20:59,906
You're insulting our hero?

713
01:21:07,948 --> 01:21:08,915
This fatso sure does blabber!

714
01:21:10,951 --> 01:21:12,919
l'll feed you stale food and you can
sit bombarding on the potty!

715
01:21:16,957 --> 01:21:17,924
She's already stinking

716
01:21:21,962 --> 01:21:22,929
Ghana Singh's wife is insulted thus?

717
01:21:25,966 --> 01:21:27,934
Go on, get lost, or people will
dump garbage on you

718
01:21:31,972 --> 01:21:32,939
You old fossil in white!

719
01:21:35,976 --> 01:21:36,943
Old fossil? Want to try me out?

720
01:21:40,981 --> 01:21:41,948
What did you call me?

721
01:21:54,995 --> 01:21:55,962
l'll have you sacked!

722
01:21:56,997 --> 01:21:58,965
She sure is a funny one!
- Enough

723
01:22:02,002 --> 01:22:02,969
Maria, Chinni, enough of jokes

724
01:22:04,004 --> 01:22:06,973
Neha, are the costumes ready?
- Absolutely

725
01:22:09,009 --> 01:22:10,977
But l've got some work
for you folks today

726
01:22:13,013 --> 01:22:13,980
What is it?

727
01:22:15,015 --> 01:22:16,983
You offered me secretaryship to
the film star recently, remember?

728
01:22:20,020 --> 01:22:21,988
You know, l wouldn't ever
turn it down

729
01:22:24,024 --> 01:22:25,992
But how will l quit
Mr Pandit's employ?

730
01:22:28,028 --> 01:22:29,996
l have a friend. She's a very
nice girl. And trustworthy too

731
01:22:35,035 --> 01:22:37,003
l can stand guarantee for her,
if you wish

732
01:22:39,039 --> 01:22:40,006
lf you could give her the job...?

733
01:22:41,041 --> 01:22:43,009
Send her over to the shoot.
She'll have the job

734
01:22:45,045 --> 01:22:47,013
Really? Will she get the job?
- l can tell a man for what he's worth

735
01:22:51,051 --> 01:22:52,018
Which is why we had offered
the job to you

736
01:22:54,054 --> 01:22:56,022
Now that you're recommending
someone else, she must be good too

737
01:22:58,058 --> 01:23:00,026
We give you our word. The three
of us will see she has the job.

738
01:23:06,066 --> 01:23:08,034
Don't tell me, Neha!
How can l handle this job?

739
01:23:11,071 --> 01:23:13,039
What's wrong with it, Pooja?
- Films? l...?

740
01:23:15,075 --> 01:23:17,043
l know nothing about films
or the film-world

741
01:23:18,078 --> 01:23:20,046
Pooja, there are good and bad
people everywhere in the world

742
01:23:24,084 --> 01:23:26,052
lt's for you to conduct yourself
the way you want to

743
01:23:27,087 --> 01:23:29,055
As for these folks,
l know them very well

744
01:23:34,094 --> 01:23:36,062
l think you're going
to find a job there

745
01:23:37,097 --> 01:23:38,064
As for your future boss...

746
01:23:41,101 --> 01:23:42,068
his staff lovingly calls him hero-ji

747
01:23:44,104 --> 01:23:46,072
He's a very nice man. Even in
a world of glitter and stardom...

748
01:23:52,112 --> 01:23:53,079
he has his feet firmly
on the ground

749
01:23:54,114 --> 01:23:56,082
No wonder he's the darling
of the masses

750
01:23:59,119 --> 01:24:01,087
What's the name of the film star?
- Raj. Raj Malhotra

751
01:24:47,167 --> 01:24:49,135
''How can anyone spend a lifetime
without love?''

752
01:24:56,176 --> 01:24:58,144
''The beloved's eyes
hold a treasure, my friend''

753
01:25:04,184 --> 01:25:07,153
''How can anyone spend a lifetime
without love?''

754
01:25:10,190 --> 01:25:12,158
''The beloved's eyes
hold a treasure, my friend''

755
01:25:19,199 --> 01:25:21,167
''On earth descend sometimes,
the Moon and the stars...''

756
01:25:35,215 --> 01:25:37,183
''such are the treasures
the beloved's eyes hold''

757
01:27:05,305 --> 01:27:07,273
''ln this lifetime,
there will be a story...''

758
01:27:11,311 --> 01:27:13,279
''no longer can l spend my youth
in loneliness''

759
01:27:18,318 --> 01:27:20,286
''So let me find a beloved...
on a night so lovely''

760
01:27:27,327 --> 01:27:29,295
''Let me listen to her heartbeat
and tell her how l feel''

761
01:27:35,335 --> 01:27:37,303
''lt's a matter of destiny to
find the support of her arms''

762
01:27:51,351 --> 01:27:53,319
''The beloved's eyes
hold a treasure, my friend''

763
01:27:57,357 --> 01:27:59,325
''How can anyone spend a lifetime
without love?''

764
01:28:38,398 --> 01:28:40,366
''Belong to someone...
and take someone for your own''

765
01:28:46,406 --> 01:28:48,374
''Let your eyes
dream lovely dreams''

766
01:28:54,414 --> 01:28:56,382
''Remain in my arms...
forget the world''

767
01:29:02,422 --> 01:29:04,390
''Let me lie in these tresses...
and kiss her moist lips''

768
01:29:09,429 --> 01:29:11,397
''Let your eyes
dream lovely dreams''

769
01:29:25,445 --> 01:29:27,413
''The beloved's eyes
hold a treasure, my friend''

770
01:29:33,453 --> 01:29:35,421
''On earth descend sometimes,
the Moon and the stars...''

771
01:29:49,469 --> 01:29:51,437
''such are the treasures
the beloved's eyes hold''

772
01:29:57,477 --> 01:29:59,445
''How can anyone spend a lifetime
without love?''

773
01:30:44,524 --> 01:30:45,491
Take it off quickly

774
01:30:48,528 --> 01:30:50,496
ln a moment, hero-ji.
Will you have some patience, please?

775
01:30:53,533 --> 01:30:55,501
Have some fruits, hero-ji.
- No food from home? No chicken?

776
01:30:58,538 --> 01:31:00,506
No chicken. You've got to remain fit.
There's so much of competition

777
01:31:01,541 --> 01:31:03,509
Look at the old-timers.
Dharmendra, Jeetendra

778
01:31:06,546 --> 01:31:08,514
They've fed on fruits for
40 years and remained fit

779
01:31:09,549 --> 01:31:10,516
Their staff has been fit
for 40 years too

780
01:31:11,551 --> 01:31:12,518
Stop talking and tell Babban Miyan
to get the car out

781
01:31:13,553 --> 01:31:15,521
The car's ready. But where will
you go and when will you return?

782
01:31:22,562 --> 01:31:23,529
The secretary has left us
in a mess of schedules...

783
01:31:24,564 --> 01:31:25,531
what have you thought about that?

784
01:31:26,566 --> 01:31:28,534
This is the problems we have when
secretaries turn producers

785
01:31:30,570 --> 01:31:31,537
Where will we find
someone honest now?

786
01:31:32,572 --> 01:31:34,540
We mustn't a crooked man!
Our hero-ji's such a simple man...

787
01:31:40,580 --> 01:31:42,548
they'd rip him apart.
- So where will l find the man?

788
01:31:45,585 --> 01:31:47,553
lt could be a woman too, right?
- A woman?

789
01:31:49,589 --> 01:31:51,557
Can a woman handle my affairs?

790
01:31:54,594 --> 01:31:56,562
When l can look after your house,
your clothes, your food, everything...

791
01:32:01,601 --> 01:32:03,569
why can't a girl look after your dates,
your schedules and your accounts?

792
01:32:09,609 --> 01:32:11,577
lf we could find an honest
and trustworthy girl...

793
01:32:14,614 --> 01:32:16,582
but where will l find one?
- We've found her already

794
01:32:20,620 --> 01:32:21,587
You've found her already?
- Yes

795
01:32:22,622 --> 01:32:23,589
And who is she?

796
01:32:27,627 --> 01:32:28,594
Where is she?
- Just a minute

797
01:32:44,644 --> 01:32:45,611
Hero-ji, this is Pooja

798
01:32:48,648 --> 01:32:50,616
Neha, the designer's assistant,
has sent her over

799
01:32:55,655 --> 01:32:57,623
Why talk in French?
l'd rather you did it in Tamil

800
01:33:01,661 --> 01:33:02,628
She's a very good girl

801
01:33:04,664 --> 01:33:06,632
You must interview her, okay?

802
01:33:18,678 --> 01:33:20,646
So, you're...?
- Let me tell you at the outset, sir

803
01:33:25,685 --> 01:33:27,653
l know nothing about
the film business

804
01:33:30,690 --> 01:33:31,657
So how will you handle this job?

805
01:33:39,699 --> 01:33:41,667
Neha and your staff asked me
to meet you. So, l...

806
01:33:47,707 --> 01:33:49,675
l see. So what are you
well-versed with?

807
01:33:57,717 --> 01:33:58,684
l'm familiar with computers

808
01:33:59,719 --> 01:34:01,687
l know a lot about programming
and accounting. That's all

809
01:34:04,724 --> 01:34:07,693
That's all? And that is enough

810
01:34:09,729 --> 01:34:11,697
The knowledge you have
is enough for this job

811
01:34:13,733 --> 01:34:15,701
You could say you've landed the job
- Pardon me?

812
01:34:17,737 --> 01:34:19,705
Yes. lf my staff says you're good,
you really are good

813
01:34:25,745 --> 01:34:27,713
So tell me how do we
sweeten your tongue now?

814
01:34:28,748 --> 01:34:29,715
With these sweetmeats!

815
01:34:32,752 --> 01:34:33,719
Here you are. Offer Pooja the sweets!

816
01:34:34,754 --> 01:34:36,722
Wow! Here you are. Have some sweets.
- Go on

817
01:34:46,766 --> 01:34:47,733
No small pieces. Take a whole laddoo

818
01:34:48,768 --> 01:34:50,736
Fortunate are those who get
to eat all these goodies

819
01:34:53,773 --> 01:34:54,740
No taunts, hero-ji

820
01:34:56,776 --> 01:34:58,744
But you may have two laddoos
to celebrate her arrival

821
01:35:00,780 --> 01:35:02,748
Not two... eat up all there is!
- Thanks. Keep this in the car

822
01:35:07,787 --> 01:35:08,754
You can report to duty tomorrow

823
01:35:15,795 --> 01:35:17,763
Hero-ji has appointed a new secretary.
She'll be here any moment

824
01:35:21,801 --> 01:35:23,769
Pooja is here! All the mess
will now be cleared!

825
01:35:29,809 --> 01:35:31,777
Come here. This is Pooja.
The new secretary

826
01:35:33,813 --> 01:35:35,781
Whatever you've got to ask,
you will now ask her. Okay?

827
01:35:41,821 --> 01:35:42,788
Namaste

828
01:35:47,827 --> 01:35:48,794
What are you doing, Babban Miyan?

829
01:35:50,830 --> 01:35:51,797
lt's a 2 'o clock shift. And you
wake me up early in the morning!

830
01:35:52,832 --> 01:35:53,799
l know. Apart from film shootings...

831
01:35:54,834 --> 01:35:55,801
there are many things you've
got to do on your own

832
01:35:56,836 --> 01:35:58,804
This big house and all those people
downstairs... who'll handle them?

833
01:36:02,842 --> 01:36:04,810
You have no one of your own either.
- So what are you folks worth?

834
01:36:11,851 --> 01:36:13,819
Okay, but there are things
we can't do. Only you can

835
01:36:15,855 --> 01:36:17,823
And this is something
only you can do, hero-ji. Not we

836
01:36:23,863 --> 01:36:25,831
Such as...?
- Such as, signing documents

837
01:36:28,868 --> 01:36:30,836
lssuing cheques. Who'll do all that?
- You do it, Miyan

838
01:36:31,871 --> 01:36:33,839
No thank you. By God, don't
trust people in the world so much

839
01:36:36,876 --> 01:36:38,844
lt's a terrible world!
Money's everything for them

840
01:36:40,880 --> 01:36:42,848
May l say my lines now?
- Sure, go ahead

841
01:36:44,884 --> 01:36:46,852
May l go for a bath?
- Sure.

842
01:36:47,887 --> 01:36:48,854
But come back soon. And see...

843
01:36:51,891 --> 01:36:52,858
how the world is waiting for you

844
01:37:01,901 --> 01:37:03,869
You said there were a lot of people.
There's not a soul here

845
01:37:11,911 --> 01:37:12,878
The producers must have fled

846
01:37:18,918 --> 01:37:19,885
My mistake

847
01:37:23,923 --> 01:37:24,890
Will you stop flying please?

848
01:37:25,925 --> 01:37:27,893
He said there were producers here
to meet me. Where have they gone?

849
01:37:28,928 --> 01:37:30,896
Bingo! The wonder girl
has worked a miracle!

850
01:37:33,933 --> 01:37:35,901
She brewed such a broth
that everything fell in place!

851
01:37:39,939 --> 01:37:40,906
lf you guys are going to say
everything, what lines will l say?

852
01:37:41,941 --> 01:37:43,909
Now tell me what happened.
- Pooja-ji! The wonder girl!

853
01:37:49,949 --> 01:37:51,917
The way she handled the producers,
l could only watch in amazement!

854
01:37:54,954 --> 01:37:56,922
l swear it on God, my eyes can
never make a mistake!

855
01:38:01,961 --> 01:38:03,929
This is the right girl, hero-ji.
- Really? And where is Pooja-ji?

856
01:38:12,972 --> 01:38:13,939
Meaning...?
- She's working. On the computer

857
01:38:20,980 --> 01:38:22,948
Are you through?
- l'm doing it... l'm still at it

858
01:38:43,002 --> 01:38:44,970
Sir, l've sorted out those dates
that were messed up

859
01:38:49,008 --> 01:38:50,976
Accounts of money we've
received against shooting,...

860
01:38:52,011 --> 01:38:52,978
l've fed in the computer

861
01:38:55,014 --> 01:38:56,982
l've fixed your appointments with
directors, during lunch-break...

862
01:39:00,019 --> 01:39:01,987
so you won't be disturbed.
You've got to read some agreements...

863
01:39:04,023 --> 01:39:06,992
and sign them now.
- Okay

864
01:39:09,028 --> 01:39:09,995
ls all the work over?
- Yes

865
01:39:13,032 --> 01:39:13,999
Nothing remaining?
- No

866
01:39:20,039 --> 01:39:22,007
ln which case, why must you come here
all thirty days in a month?

867
01:39:25,044 --> 01:39:27,012
Come just for a day.
- One day?

868
01:39:30,049 --> 01:39:32,017
Yes. What's the date today?
The first

869
01:39:33,052 --> 01:39:34,019
So we'll meet up again
on the first of the next month

870
01:39:35,054 --> 01:39:36,021
lt's pack up for you.
You may go

871
01:39:40,059 --> 01:39:42,027
What are you saying, hero-ji?
You've ruined all our joy!

872
01:39:44,063 --> 01:39:46,031
Pooja-ji handled everything so
quickly with her intelligence...

873
01:39:48,067 --> 01:39:50,035
and you just won't praise her!
- You've messed up the grease-paint!

874
01:39:56,075 --> 01:39:58,043
She completed a month's work
in just one day

875
01:40:01,080 --> 01:40:02,047
So what will she do for the
rest of the 29 days? What?

876
01:40:03,082 --> 01:40:05,050
You've worked for a day, Pooja.
You get paid for a day's work too

877
01:40:09,088 --> 01:40:11,056
Goodness isn't appreciated!
The same amount of work...

878
01:40:12,091 --> 01:40:13,058
the previous secretary took
2 months to complete!

879
01:40:14,093 --> 01:40:16,061
And you paid him double the salary!
- No wonder he became a producer!

880
01:40:20,099 --> 01:40:22,067
And you won't appreciate Pooja for
completing everything so soon!

881
01:40:24,103 --> 01:40:25,070
Where will l break my head now...?

882
01:40:44,123 --> 01:40:45,090
He's laughing!

883
01:40:47,126 --> 01:40:49,094
Sir, you're laughing?
- l was only joking

884
01:40:56,135 --> 01:40:57,102
And you talk of breaking heads?

885
01:41:09,148 --> 01:41:11,116
Where were you all these days?
Where?

886
01:41:14,153 --> 01:41:16,121
l must say, you folks do
have an eye for people

887
01:41:18,157 --> 01:41:20,125
Now tell me, how many years contract
do l draw up for her?

888
01:41:22,161 --> 01:41:24,129
20 years? 25 years...?
- For a lifetime. Forever, sir!

889
01:41:28,167 --> 01:41:30,135
No secretary works like this.
Only a wife does...

890
01:41:32,171 --> 01:41:33,138
the one made for you, does!

891
01:41:49,188 --> 01:41:51,156
Have l said something wrong?
- You always say the wrong line

892
01:41:52,191 --> 01:41:54,159
What did l say?
- l'll tell you later

893
01:42:03,202 --> 01:42:05,170
You mustn't take offense
at what they say

894
01:42:06,205 --> 01:42:08,173
Because l'm so lonely, they're
always cooking things up for me

895
01:42:12,211 --> 01:42:13,178
They aren't bad at heart

896
01:42:14,213 --> 01:42:15,180
You have handled everything
in just a day, l'm impressed

897
01:42:16,215 --> 01:42:18,183
Know what? l had this problem
for quite a few days

898
01:42:24,223 --> 01:42:26,191
l couldn't decide what was right
and what was wrong

899
01:42:27,226 --> 01:42:28,193
But now l think everything
will be all right

900
01:42:29,228 --> 01:42:31,196
Get on with your work.
Please carry on

901
01:42:44,243 --> 01:42:46,211
Poojaji, please don't feel bad
about anything

902
01:42:48,247 --> 01:42:50,215
Now that you're here,
it's going to be fun

903
01:42:52,251 --> 01:42:54,219
We'll do good work and
spend our days in fun

904
01:42:56,255 --> 01:42:58,223
We won't even know when
the climes change

905
01:44:38,357 --> 01:44:39,324
Raj, give me just two minutes. Please

906
01:44:41,360 --> 01:44:42,327
Chinni, please come here

907
01:44:46,365 --> 01:44:47,332
What is it, Pooja?

908
01:44:49,368 --> 01:44:50,335
There was a call from
Mr Morani and Mr Soorma

909
01:44:51,370 --> 01:44:53,338
l think they want to discuss
dates personally with you

910
01:44:54,373 --> 01:44:56,341
So l'll meet up with them.
Just tell me when

911
01:44:57,376 --> 01:44:59,344
Anytime you wish.
l'll tell you your programme

912
01:45:02,381 --> 01:45:03,348
Raj, please let's have
another rehearsal

913
01:45:04,383 --> 01:45:06,351
lf l mess up this time, l'm
going to get a lot of scolding

914
01:45:07,386 --> 01:45:08,353
All right. Wait here, Pooja

915
01:45:11,390 --> 01:45:12,357
l'll speak my lines, okay?
- No, let's begin with my lines

916
01:45:13,392 --> 01:45:14,359
All right. Go ahead

917
01:45:15,394 --> 01:47:16,476
l'm so happy today...

918
01:47:19,518 --> 01:47:20,485
Where is she, Raja?
- Who?

919
01:47:23,522 --> 01:47:24,489
She

920
01:47:27,526 --> 01:47:28,493
Why need that when you
have this one?

921
01:47:30,529 --> 01:47:31,496
What?
- What does that mean?

922
01:47:35,534 --> 01:47:36,501
l'll tell you what it means

923
01:47:38,537 --> 01:47:40,505
Rascals! Have you nothing
better to do?

924
01:47:42,541 --> 01:47:44,509
Do you come here
only to bother girls?

925
01:47:45,544 --> 01:47:47,512
Have you been taught nothing better?
Can you only talk nonsense?

926
01:47:48,547 --> 01:47:49,514
Come here...

927
01:47:52,551 --> 01:47:53,518
l'm going to smash your face

928
01:47:55,554 --> 01:47:56,521
You won't be able to
face anyone again

929
01:47:57,556 --> 01:47:59,524
Your tongues wag a lot!
You want to have fun!

930
01:48:00,559 --> 01:48:02,527
You want girls, eh?
You want girls?

931
01:48:12,571 --> 01:48:13,538
Was this enough or do you
want some more fun?

932
01:48:14,573 --> 01:48:15,540
No! Enough!

933
01:48:16,575 --> 01:48:17,542
So when are you leaving the hotel?

934
01:48:18,577 --> 01:48:19,544
Today! Right now!
- Good

935
01:48:20,579 --> 01:48:22,547
Get lost soon.
- Sure we will

936
01:48:28,587 --> 01:48:30,555
Room No 420.
A room for frauds indeed.

937
01:48:32,591 --> 01:48:34,559
You must apologise to all
those you have insulted

938
01:48:36,595 --> 01:48:37,562
l'll wait for you

939
01:48:46,605 --> 01:48:47,572
Heroji, they're escaping

940
01:48:55,614 --> 01:48:57,582
Where are you guys going...?
Wait... you don't have to leave

941
01:48:58,617 --> 01:48:59,584
Leave after you watch the shooting.
- No thanks

942
01:49:01,620 --> 01:49:02,587
You must have fun!
- No thanks

943
01:49:03,622 --> 01:49:05,590
How can l let you leave like this?
Go after you see the shooting

944
01:49:06,625 --> 01:49:08,593
Come, l'll introduce you
to the whole unit

945
01:49:09,628 --> 01:49:11,596
This is the director.
Say namaste to him

946
01:49:13,632 --> 01:49:14,599
Namaste

947
01:49:15,634 --> 01:49:17,602
This is our heroine.
Pay your respects to her

948
01:49:18,637 --> 01:49:20,605
Our respects.
- This is my make-up man, Chinni

949
01:49:23,642 --> 01:49:24,609
Hello.
- Hello

950
01:49:25,644 --> 01:49:26,611
No hello. Touch his feet

951
01:49:29,648 --> 01:49:31,616
Go on. Take his blessings.
You've got to play the baddies

952
01:49:36,655 --> 01:49:38,623
You haven't met her. She's...
- Namaste, Pooja

953
01:49:43,662 --> 01:49:45,630
Namaste, Poojaji.
- Poojaji?

954
01:49:46,665 --> 01:49:48,633
Sister Pooja!
- Good. But try something new

955
01:49:50,669 --> 01:49:52,637
Something spontaneous.
- Praise the Lord, Sister Pooja

956
01:49:53,672 --> 01:49:55,640
Praise the Lord! You do have
respect for womenfolk

957
01:49:59,678 --> 01:50:00,645
You must come to the shoot tomorrow.
Oh yes, you must!

958
01:50:01,680 --> 01:50:03,648
Where are we shooting
tomorrow, Poojaji?

959
01:50:04,683 --> 01:50:05,650
We're shooting at the graveyard

960
01:50:06,685 --> 01:50:08,653
We're going to bury the dead.
You must attend!

961
01:50:10,689 --> 01:50:11,656
You must! Please!

962
01:50:14,693 --> 01:50:15,660
Don't make me lose my temper...
l might push you

963
01:50:18,697 --> 01:50:19,664
They've had it

964
01:50:26,705 --> 01:50:27,672
l'm sorry

965
01:50:30,709 --> 01:50:32,677
Stop giggling and attend
to my hair, Chinni

966
01:50:47,726 --> 01:50:48,693
What are you writing?

967
01:50:50,729 --> 01:50:51,696
What are you writing?
- Nothing

968
01:50:53,732 --> 01:50:54,699
Let me see what you're writing

969
01:51:07,746 --> 01:51:09,714
l knew you'd do something like this.
That you would resign

970
01:51:12,751 --> 01:51:14,719
This is how you girls are.
You flare up at everything

971
01:51:16,755 --> 01:51:17,722
Tell you what? Go into the
kitchen and smash things

972
01:51:18,757 --> 01:51:20,725
Your temper will cool down.
- You cooled down. By beating them up

973
01:51:28,767 --> 01:51:30,735
There wasn't a better way
of handling it, was there?

974
01:51:31,770 --> 01:51:33,738
Was it necessary to do all that?
- lt's like this, Pooja

975
01:51:36,775 --> 01:51:37,742
lt makes no difference to me
what they write or say about me

976
01:51:41,780 --> 01:51:42,747
Because my life is an open book

977
01:51:43,782 --> 01:51:45,750
But l know, it makes
a difference to you

978
01:51:47,786 --> 01:51:49,754
You can't tolerate it, because
you're not used to it

979
01:51:52,791 --> 01:51:54,759
So l did what l had to.
And you're angry with me?

980
01:51:56,795 --> 01:51:58,763
You're handing in your resignation?
- Please don't misunderstand me

981
01:52:00,799 --> 01:52:02,767
l don't want such a thing
to happen ever again

982
01:52:04,803 --> 01:52:06,771
They... they could say
anything about you and me

983
01:52:08,807 --> 01:52:10,775
So let them!
l'm not backing out, am l?

984
01:52:18,817 --> 01:52:19,784
What...?

985
01:52:20,819 --> 01:52:21,786
And what do you think?

986
01:52:22,821 --> 01:52:24,789
That you will give me the resignation
and l will let you go?

987
01:52:29,828 --> 01:52:31,796
God has brought us together
at the right time

988
01:52:33,832 --> 01:52:35,800
You're lonely. So am l
Where would we meet, if not here?

989
01:52:37,836 --> 01:52:39,804
Why don't we get to know
each other better?

990
01:52:42,841 --> 01:52:43,808
You don't know anything about me

991
01:52:45,844 --> 01:52:47,812
l don't even want to

992
01:52:48,847 --> 01:52:50,815
That you've heard me out and haven't
even slapped me, is enough for me

993
01:52:54,853 --> 01:52:56,821
You look so nice when you smile.
Always keep smiling

994
01:53:00,859 --> 01:53:01,826
Wrong timing

995
01:53:04,863 --> 01:53:06,831
Whenever l'm going to say something
nice, Mr Chopra will always call up

996
01:53:10,869 --> 01:53:12,837
Mr Chopra? Yes, everything
has been arranged

997
01:53:14,873 --> 01:53:15,840
Yes, l've done my packing

998
01:53:16,875 --> 01:53:17,842
Aren't we going to Australia?
So...?

999
01:53:26,885 --> 01:53:28,853
l have a request.
Book another ticket

1000
01:53:30,889 --> 01:53:31,856
The name is... Pooja.
- No

1001
01:53:34,893 --> 01:53:35,860
lt's confirmed, yes

1002
01:53:38,897 --> 01:53:39,864
How can l...?

1003
01:53:42,901 --> 01:53:44,869
l've been all over the world.
But there's no place like Switzerland

1004
01:53:48,907 --> 01:53:49,874
lt's heaven!

1005
01:54:00,919 --> 01:54:02,887
Why don't you want to go, Pooja?
What's wrong with that?

1006
01:54:06,925 --> 01:54:08,893
Besides, you're going there
on business too

1007
01:54:10,929 --> 01:54:12,897
How long will you keep
feeling afraid like this?

1008
01:54:14,933 --> 01:54:16,901
How long will you cling
to your old memories?

1009
01:54:18,937 --> 01:54:19,904
How long will you hide?

1010
01:54:21,940 --> 01:54:23,908
You must set out
on the same path again

1011
01:54:24,943 --> 01:54:26,911
On the same path, you must wipe out
the old foot-prints with new ones

1012
01:54:35,954 --> 01:54:36,921
You must show courage, Pooja.
And move forward

1013
01:54:39,958 --> 01:54:40,925
Don't stop yourself. Don't

1014
01:54:43,962 --> 01:54:44,929
Life's once again calling out to you

1015
01:54:47,966 --> 01:54:49,934
You must embark a new journey
once again, Pooja

1016
01:54:54,973 --> 01:54:56,941
You must go, Pooja.
You must

1017
01:55:45,023 --> 01:55:45,990
There's that lady sitting
there on Seat No. 3B

1018
01:55:47,025 --> 01:55:48,993
Ask her what she wants.
Or she won't ask for anything

1019
01:55:59,037 --> 01:56:00,004
Thanks, l want nothing

1020
01:56:05,043 --> 01:56:07,011
Shiv! Leave me alone!
What are you doing?

1021
01:56:12,050 --> 01:56:14,018
This isn't our bedroom.
lt's an aircraft. Leave me alone!

1022
01:56:16,054 --> 01:56:17,021
You won't stop being mischievous!

1023
01:56:21,059 --> 01:56:22,026
Let me go...
- Should l?

1024
01:56:26,064 --> 01:56:28,032
Here goes. l'll be back in a moment?
- Where to? Come back soon

1025
01:56:41,079 --> 01:56:42,046
You've just been married?

1026
01:56:44,082 --> 01:56:46,050
Yes. A few days ago. We're going
to Switzerland on a honeymoon

1027
01:56:49,087 --> 01:56:50,054
The dream of every lndian

1028
01:56:51,089 --> 01:56:52,056
Right

1029
01:56:59,097 --> 01:57:00,064
ls this your first visit?
- No...

1030
01:57:05,103 --> 01:57:06,070
Yes. This is my first visit too

1031
01:57:07,105 --> 01:57:08,072
l'm told it's heaven

1032
01:57:11,109 --> 01:57:13,077
We could have gone anywhere
else in the world

1033
01:57:15,113 --> 01:57:17,081
But l believe that Switzerland
is very lucky for married couples

1034
01:57:19,117 --> 01:57:20,084
lt's just great for those in love

1035
01:57:25,123 --> 01:57:27,091
l'm very lucky. My husband
is a very nice man

1036
01:57:34,132 --> 01:57:35,099
Are you married?

1037
01:57:38,136 --> 01:57:39,103
No

1038
01:57:40,138 --> 01:57:42,106
Maybe you won't get the
same feeling as l do

1039
01:57:44,142 --> 01:57:46,110
From what l'm told,
it's a place...

1040
01:57:48,146 --> 01:57:49,113
which gives you memories
for a lifetime,...

1041
01:57:50,148 --> 01:57:52,116
should you spend a few moments
there with your beloved

1042
01:57:54,152 --> 01:57:56,120
No matter how much you try,
you can never erase those memories

1043
01:59:17,235 --> 01:59:19,203
''l'm your love;
my heart beats for you...''

1044
01:59:23,241 --> 01:59:24,208
''do always be with me''

1045
01:59:29,247 --> 01:59:31,215
''Should you have a grouse
against me...''

1046
01:59:36,254 --> 01:59:37,221
''do tell me''

1047
01:59:41,259 --> 01:59:42,226
''l have loved you too...''

1048
01:59:47,265 --> 01:59:48,232
''Yes, l have been in love too''

1049
01:59:54,272 --> 01:59:56,240
''l'm your love;
my heart beats for you...''

1050
02:00:01,279 --> 02:00:02,246
''do always be with me''

1051
02:00:06,284 --> 02:00:09,253
''Should you have a grouse
against me...''

1052
02:00:13,291 --> 02:00:14,258
''do tell me''

1053
02:00:16,294 --> 02:00:17,261
''But do be with me''

1054
02:00:20,298 --> 02:00:21,265
''l have loved you too...''

1055
02:00:25,303 --> 02:00:26,270
''Yes, l'm in love with you''

1056
02:01:43,381 --> 02:01:45,349
''How will l forget
the moments l spent?''

1057
02:01:50,388 --> 02:01:52,356
''Every moment,
those memories torment me''

1058
02:01:56,394 --> 02:01:58,362
''How will l tell you?
lt's a secret l keep with difficulty''

1059
02:02:01,399 --> 02:02:02,366
''Those moments never come...''

1060
02:02:05,403 --> 02:02:06,370
''what's true is here,
this moment''

1061
02:02:21,419 --> 02:02:23,387
''Come to me, my love.
Give me a smile and talk to me...''

1062
02:02:27,425 --> 02:02:28,392
''do not remain silent''

1063
02:02:40,438 --> 02:02:41,405
''do tell me''

1064
02:02:42,440 --> 02:02:43,407
''But do be with me''

1065
02:03:45,503 --> 02:03:46,470
''everything here is
for you, my love''

1066
02:03:52,510 --> 02:03:54,478
''There are thorns among roses,
and a chill in the snow''

1067
02:03:58,516 --> 02:04:00,484
''What fire consumes
my breath all day and night?''

1068
02:04:16,534 --> 02:04:17,501
''This cold breeze say...''

1069
02:04:24,542 --> 02:04:25,509
''do not burn thus''

1070
02:04:29,547 --> 02:04:31,515
''Should you have a grouse
against me...''

1071
02:04:36,554 --> 02:04:37,521
''do tell me''

1072
02:04:39,557 --> 02:04:40,524
''But do be with me''

1073
02:05:07,585 --> 02:05:08,552
''Yes, l am in love with you''

1074
02:05:21,599 --> 02:05:23,567
Here you are, Babban Miyan. The
clothes for your schedule are ready

1075
02:05:25,603 --> 02:05:27,571
Thank you very much.
- No, l must thank you

1076
02:05:33,611 --> 02:05:34,578
You gave Pooja such a nice job.
- We do nothing

1077
02:05:35,613 --> 02:05:37,581
God gives everyone
his rightful place

1078
02:05:42,620 --> 02:05:44,588
Not just a family member...
a lifetime member

1079
02:05:45,623 --> 02:05:47,591
What did l say the other day...?
- Shut up, Chinni

1080
02:05:50,628 --> 02:05:51,595
''Come unto me, O beloved''

1081
02:05:59,637 --> 02:06:01,605
Neha, everything is all right.
Just don't worry

1082
02:06:04,642 --> 02:06:05,609
Your boss always advises me
to wear ordinary clothes

1083
02:06:17,655 --> 02:06:19,623
Ordinary clothes give one
peace of mind

1084
02:06:23,661 --> 02:06:24,628
The heart is no longer restless

1085
02:06:27,665 --> 02:06:29,633
What is more, one has control
over his tongue

1086
02:06:32,670 --> 02:06:33,637
You folks...? Pranaam.
- Pranaam

1087
02:06:37,675 --> 02:06:38,642
How are you?

1088
02:06:39,677 --> 02:06:41,645
How's your lovely world
of films doing?

1089
02:06:43,681 --> 02:06:45,649
You make such lovely films

1090
02:06:46,684 --> 02:06:48,652
You are such lovely folks.
Aren't you?

1091
02:06:50,688 --> 02:06:52,656
Are you shooting a song again?
- Well...

1092
02:06:56,694 --> 02:06:57,661
Go ahead.
Make a whole lot of costumes

1093
02:07:01,699 --> 02:07:03,667
Change as many clothes
as you wish to

1094
02:07:07,705 --> 02:07:09,673
Behind trees, on the mountains...
change wherever you wish to

1095
02:07:14,712 --> 02:07:16,680
What have l to do with it?
Right?

1096
02:07:17,715 --> 02:07:19,683
Well, may Chana Singh,
wife of Ghana Singh, leave now?

1097
02:07:24,722 --> 02:07:26,690
My two children must be impatiently
waiting for their mother's arrival

1098
02:07:27,725 --> 02:07:30,694
Gana Singh must be waiting for me
at the religious gathering

1099
02:07:34,732 --> 02:07:35,699
''When will you come?''

1100
02:07:38,736 --> 02:07:40,704
Good bye.
- Good bye

1101
02:07:43,741 --> 02:07:44,708
''Come unto me, O beloved''

1102
02:08:08,766 --> 02:08:10,734
Gana's going to die!
What sorrow after happiness!

1103
02:08:15,773 --> 02:08:18,742
Pooja told me you're going to a hill
station for shooting, Babban Miyan

1104
02:08:23,781 --> 02:08:24,748
A beautiful hill station in lndia

1105
02:08:25,783 --> 02:08:26,750
Whenever we have been there,
something has always blossomed

1106
02:08:27,785 --> 02:08:29,753
Let's see what blossoms
at Naini Hills this time

1107
02:09:00,818 --> 02:09:02,786
''Tie the dancing-bells
to my feet...''

1108
02:09:07,825 --> 02:09:08,792
''and watch my swagger''

1109
02:09:20,838 --> 02:09:22,806
Oh yes. You're shooting at
Naini Hills this time

1110
02:09:24,842 --> 02:09:25,809
Where is the manager?

1111
02:09:26,844 --> 02:09:27,811
What for, sir?
What is it regarding?

1112
02:09:28,846 --> 02:09:30,814
Regarding? l've got to discuss
things with him. ln detail

1113
02:09:36,854 --> 02:09:38,822
His cabin is over there, sir

1114
02:09:45,863 --> 02:09:46,830
Manager, salutations

1115
02:09:54,872 --> 02:09:55,839
Greetings. Well?

1116
02:09:57,875 --> 02:09:59,843
l'm Mr Raj Malhotra's trusted man.
His driver, his Man Friday, Babban

1117
02:10:08,886 --> 02:10:10,854
l came to enquire about his room.
lt's secluded, l hope?

1118
02:10:12,890 --> 02:10:14,858
What does that mean?
- By God...

1119
02:10:16,894 --> 02:10:18,862
fans nowadays harass him a lot.
He's such a simple man...

1120
02:10:22,900 --> 02:10:24,868
he doesn't want the hassle.
- Don't worry

1121
02:10:27,905 --> 02:10:28,872
l've personally made all the
arrangements for him

1122
02:10:29,907 --> 02:10:31,875
You will have no cause for complaint.
- That's very kind of you. Thank you

1123
02:10:33,911 --> 02:10:35,879
You must have seen his films?
- No, l don't see films

1124
02:10:41,919 --> 02:10:43,887
You live in lndia and
don't watch films?

1125
02:10:46,924 --> 02:10:47,891
What say, manager...?
You're different too?

1126
02:10:52,930 --> 02:10:54,898
That's not how it is. l used to
see films earlier. l don't anymore

1127
02:10:57,935 --> 02:11:00,904
And you're missing nothing. Where are
the films they used to make earlier?

1128
02:11:06,944 --> 02:11:07,911
Where are those heroes
and heroines anymore?

1129
02:11:11,949 --> 02:11:12,916
Where will you find those stories?

1130
02:11:14,952 --> 02:11:15,919
What films they used to make

1131
02:11:17,955 --> 02:11:19,923
l used to be in Mr Yusuf Khan's
employ during those days

1132
02:11:20,958 --> 02:11:23,927
An artist like him has never graced
the lndian screen ever again

1133
02:11:26,964 --> 02:11:27,931
lt's all over.
After l left him...

1134
02:11:28,966 --> 02:11:30,934
l joined the hero.
My hero does only hit films

1135
02:11:35,973 --> 02:11:36,940
l make the choice

1136
02:11:38,976 --> 02:11:39,943
Which is why l'm with him

1137
02:11:41,979 --> 02:11:43,947
Even to take a look at his room,
this servant comes first...

1138
02:11:45,983 --> 02:11:46,950
he'll come later

1139
02:11:48,986 --> 02:11:50,954
Rest assured, Babban Miyan.
You will have no complaints

1140
02:11:54,992 --> 02:11:55,959
When is your boss arriving?

1141
02:11:58,996 --> 02:11:59,963
The hero's caravan should be here
any moment

1142
02:13:48,103 --> 02:13:51,072
Mr Raj Malhotra has checked in, sir.
You wanted to meet him, didn't you?

1143
02:13:58,113 --> 02:13:59,080
l'll talk to him over the phone.
Go on

1144
02:14:42,157 --> 02:14:43,124
May l speak to Mr Raj Malhotra?

1145
02:14:53,168 --> 02:14:54,135
Who's this?

1146
02:14:58,173 --> 02:14:59,140
The manager of this hotel

1147
02:15:02,177 --> 02:15:03,144
One moment

1148
02:15:06,181 --> 02:15:07,148
Call for you.
- Who is it?

1149
02:15:09,184 --> 02:15:10,151
The manager of this hotel.

1150
02:15:22,197 --> 02:15:23,164
My name is Shiv Kapoor

1151
02:15:27,202 --> 02:15:28,169
Yes, Manager?

1152
02:15:33,208 --> 02:15:35,176
lf there's anything you need,
please do let me know

1153
02:15:37,212 --> 02:15:38,179
You have a beautiful hotel

1154
02:15:41,216 --> 02:15:43,184
l can see in everything that
it's being managed nicely

1155
02:15:48,223 --> 02:15:50,191
lf there's anything you need,
you'll find me on extension 16

1156
02:15:52,227 --> 02:15:54,195
Please do call me.
- Of course l'll call you...

1157
02:15:55,230 --> 02:15:57,198
if l have problem.
Where else will l go?

1158
02:16:07,242 --> 02:16:09,210
But l'm finding everything
nice today

1159
02:16:12,247 --> 02:16:13,214
l'm the same,
so is everything else

1160
02:16:14,249 --> 02:16:15,216
Yet, l see a change
in something around

1161
02:16:16,251 --> 02:16:18,219
These eyes of mine have always
dreamt dreams for others, Pooja

1162
02:16:19,254 --> 02:16:21,222
For the first time, they're
daring to dream for themselves

1163
02:16:26,261 --> 02:16:28,229
They aren't doing anything
wrong, are they?

1164
02:16:33,268 --> 02:16:35,236
You can't ignore my remark
with a smile

1165
02:16:39,274 --> 02:16:40,241
You must give me an answer

1166
02:16:45,280 --> 02:16:48,249
You want to tell me something
before telling me about your decision?

1167
02:16:57,292 --> 02:16:59,260
You want to tell me
about your past?

1168
02:17:02,297 --> 02:17:03,264
l don't want to listen

1169
02:17:06,301 --> 02:17:07,268
But if it's going to relieve you
of a burden...

1170
02:17:10,305 --> 02:17:12,273
and makes it easier for you
to decide about me...

1171
02:17:16,311 --> 02:17:18,279
But remember this much.
No matter what you say...

1172
02:17:21,316 --> 02:17:22,283
my decision won't change

1173
02:17:26,321 --> 02:17:27,288
Speak

1174
02:17:29,324 --> 02:17:30,291
Speak, Pooja

1175
02:17:32,327 --> 02:17:33,294
l'm a divorcee

1176
02:17:37,332 --> 02:17:38,299
l was in love with someone

1177
02:17:41,336 --> 02:17:42,303
And we were separated

1178
02:17:47,342 --> 02:17:48,309
l told you, it won't
make a difference to me

1179
02:17:49,344 --> 02:17:51,312
lt'll stop making a difference to you
if you stop living in the past

1180
02:17:54,349 --> 02:17:55,316
Forget what has happened

1181
02:17:56,351 --> 02:17:58,319
What is with you now
is the only truth

1182
02:17:59,354 --> 02:18:01,322
So tell me quickly...
is it ''yes'' Or is it ''yes'' ?

1183
02:18:02,357 --> 02:18:04,325
Because there's no question
of saying ''No''

1184
02:18:08,363 --> 02:18:11,332
Know what? l'll pack up with
the shooting quickly...

1185
02:18:12,367 --> 02:18:14,335
and we'll go and prepare
for the wedding

1186
02:18:15,370 --> 02:18:17,338
No, that's wrong. We'll leave
after we complete our work

1187
02:18:20,375 --> 02:18:23,344
Get ready quickly. The whole unit
must be waiting there for you

1188
02:18:25,380 --> 02:18:27,348
l'll complete my pending work
and get there too

1189
02:18:44,399 --> 02:18:47,368
Let's have a small party in the
lawns of the hotel this evening

1190
02:18:48,403 --> 02:18:50,371
To celebrate our happiness
We won't tell anyone anything

1191
02:18:53,408 --> 02:18:55,376
Meet the manager and
organise the party

1192
02:18:56,411 --> 02:18:58,379
Now what was the manager's name...?

1193
02:20:08,483 --> 02:20:11,452
You're with Mr Raj Malhotra.
- That's right

1194
02:20:13,488 --> 02:20:15,456
Mr Malhotra wants to throw a small
party on the lawns tonight

1195
02:20:17,492 --> 02:20:18,459
l wanted to talk to you
about it

1196
02:20:19,494 --> 02:20:20,461
l want everything to
be perfectly organised

1197
02:20:23,498 --> 02:20:25,466
lt would be better if you could
discuss it with our manager

1198
02:20:27,502 --> 02:20:29,470
No. lt's enough that
l have spoken to you

1199
02:20:32,507 --> 02:20:34,475
Who is your manager, by the way?
- Mr Kapoor

1200
02:20:39,514 --> 02:20:41,482
His full name?
- Mr Shiv Kapoor

1201
02:20:46,521 --> 02:20:48,489
Has he just arrived?
- Yes. He's been with us for a year

1202
02:20:53,528 --> 02:20:54,495
Where is he from?
- Delhi

1203
02:20:58,533 --> 02:21:01,502
Where does he stay here?
- ln the cottage behind the hotel

1204
02:21:04,539 --> 02:21:06,507
ls his family here too?
- No, he's all alone

1205
02:21:10,545 --> 02:21:12,513
l see. Please see that everything
is perfectly organised

1206
02:21:42,577 --> 02:21:44,545
He's the manager you were
asking me about, madam

1207
02:21:50,585 --> 02:21:52,553
She was asking me so many
questions about you...

1208
02:21:55,590 --> 02:21:57,558
and she just walks away now.
Strange!

1209
02:22:08,603 --> 02:22:09,570
''What's love...?''

1210
02:22:12,607 --> 02:22:13,574
''fall in love,
and you will know''

1211
02:22:14,609 --> 02:22:15,576
''Make her laugh some,
make her cry some''

1212
02:22:18,613 --> 02:22:20,581
''The firefly burns...
and why?''

1213
02:22:27,622 --> 02:22:29,590
''burn yourself,
if you must discover the secret''

1214
02:22:32,627 --> 02:22:34,595
Heroji, you're playing
the firefly today...

1215
02:22:37,632 --> 02:22:39,600
and where is your flame?
- Keep that under wraps

1216
02:22:42,637 --> 02:22:44,605
''Why ask him about
playing Romeo''

1217
02:22:46,641 --> 02:22:47,608
''Come to me,
thou shall be Juliet''

1218
02:22:48,643 --> 02:22:49,610
That's great, Babban Miyan!

1219
02:22:52,647 --> 02:22:53,614
What's happening?

1220
02:22:59,654 --> 02:23:00,621
Everybody disappears
in the darkness?

1221
02:23:04,659 --> 02:23:05,626
Where's everybody?

1222
02:23:14,669 --> 02:23:15,636
Who are you?

1223
02:23:18,673 --> 02:23:19,640
l'm the manager of this hotel

1224
02:23:21,676 --> 02:23:23,644
There's a power-failure.
lt'll be restored soon

1225
02:23:25,680 --> 02:23:26,647
So you are the manager?

1226
02:23:30,685 --> 02:23:32,653
l must say, you've done
a great job of our party

1227
02:23:34,689 --> 02:23:35,656
You remember my name?

1228
02:23:36,691 --> 02:23:38,659
Once l hear a name,
l don't ever forget it

1229
02:23:39,694 --> 02:23:41,662
And you have such a lovely name.
Shiv Kapoor

1230
02:23:43,698 --> 02:23:45,666
l'm thinking of using that name
for myself in my next film

1231
02:23:49,704 --> 02:23:51,672
You appear to be very happy, sir.
You've even thrown a party

1232
02:23:53,708 --> 02:23:55,676
What makes you so happy?
- That's just what l can't tell you

1233
02:23:57,712 --> 02:23:59,680
lt's giving me a stomach-ache!
But l think l'll tell you how l feel

1234
02:24:05,720 --> 02:24:06,687
l'll at least be rid
of the stomach-ache

1235
02:24:07,722 --> 02:24:08,689
Must l...?
- Go ahead, sir

1236
02:24:09,724 --> 02:24:11,692
lf it will relieve you of your
stomach-ache, give me the pain sir

1237
02:24:14,729 --> 02:24:16,697
You won't tell anyone, will you?

1238
02:24:18,733 --> 02:24:19,700
Sure?

1239
02:24:23,738 --> 02:24:24,705
l've fallen in love with someone

1240
02:24:26,741 --> 02:24:28,709
And l'm going to get married
the moment l leave this place

1241
02:24:29,744 --> 02:24:30,711
Congratulations. Who is it?

1242
02:24:35,750 --> 02:24:36,717
The lights are back!

1243
02:24:40,755 --> 02:24:41,722
And my beloved too

1244
02:24:54,769 --> 02:24:56,737
Pooja, you must've met him already.
The manager, Mr Shiv Kapoor

1245
02:24:58,773 --> 02:24:59,740
Look at the pains he has taken
to make this a grand party

1246
02:25:00,775 --> 02:25:01,742
He's amazing

1247
02:25:05,780 --> 02:25:07,748
Why don't we let him handle
the decorations at our wedding?

1248
02:25:10,785 --> 02:25:12,753
l don't know why, but l felt
a sense of belonging with him

1249
02:25:14,789 --> 02:25:15,756
And l told him my secret

1250
02:25:17,792 --> 02:25:19,760
We have decided that you will handle
the decorations at our wedding

1251
02:25:20,795 --> 02:25:21,762
Well?
- Yes

1252
02:25:23,798 --> 02:25:24,765
You will make it as beautiful
as this party. You are amazing!

1253
02:25:25,800 --> 02:25:27,768
You get married only
once in a lifetime

1254
02:25:28,803 --> 02:25:30,771
l want my wedding to be
such a grand affair...

1255
02:25:32,807 --> 02:25:34,775
that people are left stunned.
Let's shake hands. C'mon!

1256
02:25:42,817 --> 02:25:44,785
Raj, are you through
with your couplets?

1257
02:25:45,820 --> 02:25:46,787
There's a gathering there also.
Let's go

1258
02:25:47,822 --> 02:25:49,790
l'll recite a couplet
and be back. lt's just that...

1259
02:25:54,829 --> 02:25:56,797
''lf there is anything that
is ignorant, it's the rose''

1260
02:25:57,832 --> 02:25:58,799
''The whole garden
knows the secret''

1261
02:26:01,836 --> 02:26:03,804
Pooja, l want to discuss
something with you

1262
02:26:04,839 --> 02:26:06,807
But l don't wish to talk to you

1263
02:26:10,845 --> 02:26:11,812
l'll wait for you in my cottage

1264
02:26:56,891 --> 02:26:57,858
Will you remain standing there?

1265
02:26:59,894 --> 02:27:00,861
Come on in

1266
02:27:20,915 --> 02:27:21,882
Sit down

1267
02:27:22,917 --> 02:27:24,885
Won't you sit?
- No. l'm okay

1268
02:27:29,924 --> 02:27:30,891
You're still angry?

1269
02:27:34,929 --> 02:27:35,896
You're still sulking?

1270
02:27:41,936 --> 02:27:43,904
You haven't changed.
Not in the least

1271
02:27:48,943 --> 02:27:50,911
You're still the same person
l first met

1272
02:27:54,949 --> 02:27:56,917
When you and l fought
for the same job

1273
02:27:59,954 --> 02:28:00,921
And we're still fighting

1274
02:28:08,963 --> 02:28:10,931
Know something, Pooja?
l could never get over the fact...

1275
02:28:15,970 --> 02:28:17,938
that you gave up everything you had
in just a moment. Only for me

1276
02:28:22,977 --> 02:28:23,944
To settle down with me

1277
02:28:27,982 --> 02:28:28,949
You came to be my companion

1278
02:28:37,992 --> 02:28:39,960
l don't know if you
ever miss me, Pooja...

1279
02:28:48,002 --> 02:28:48,969
but l could never forget you

1280
02:28:53,007 --> 02:28:53,974
Never

1281
02:28:58,012 --> 02:28:59,980
To forget you, l left that job,
that city and all those memories...

1282
02:29:07,021 --> 02:29:07,988
and started living here

1283
02:29:14,028 --> 02:29:14,995
But you have come here too

1284
02:29:20,034 --> 02:29:22,002
Just as destiny always brought us
together...

1285
02:29:25,039 --> 02:29:27,007
it's the same destiny that
has brought us together again

1286
02:29:32,046 --> 02:29:34,014
When l found you asking about me,
it gave me a lot of confidence

1287
02:29:38,052 --> 02:29:40,020
l thought you had not been
able to forget me

1288
02:29:44,058 --> 02:29:45,025
So why all this, Pooja?

1289
02:29:48,062 --> 02:29:50,030
How can you leave me
and go ahead like this?

1290
02:29:53,067 --> 02:29:55,035
lt's my free will. Who are you
to ask me why l'm doing all this?

1291
02:29:59,073 --> 02:30:00,040
l will do as l please

1292
02:30:01,075 --> 02:30:02,042
l do not need to seek
permission from anyone

1293
02:30:03,077 --> 02:30:05,045
And l've seen what l got
when l asked earlier

1294
02:30:08,082 --> 02:30:09,049
Deceit! And betrayal!

1295
02:30:15,089 --> 02:30:16,056
Pooja, can't you forget all that?

1296
02:30:24,098 --> 02:30:26,066
Must you give me such a big punishment
for something so trivial?

1297
02:30:28,102 --> 02:30:29,069
So trivial? You call it trivial?

1298
02:30:34,108 --> 02:30:36,076
What didn't l do for you?
l changed the course of my life!

1299
02:30:40,114 --> 02:30:41,081
When a woman gives up everything
for her man...

1300
02:30:43,117 --> 02:30:45,085
she nurtures the relationship with
sincerity, devotion and desires

1301
02:30:48,122 --> 02:30:50,090
l honoured every vow
l took with you

1302
02:30:52,126 --> 02:30:54,094
But you forgot the vow of fidelity
you had taken with me

1303
02:30:56,130 --> 02:30:58,098
You had sworn to remain loyal,
you had sworn to be faithful

1304
02:31:00,134 --> 02:31:02,102
By breaking the sacred vows,
you have deceived not only me...

1305
02:31:03,137 --> 02:31:05,105
you have betrayed God too!
You are a sinner!

1306
02:31:07,141 --> 02:31:08,108
And you must be punished
for your sins!

1307
02:31:10,144 --> 02:31:11,111
Really? So what do you want?

1308
02:31:12,146 --> 02:31:14,114
What punishment do you
want to give me?

1309
02:31:18,152 --> 02:31:19,119
Do you want me to be hanged?

1310
02:31:23,157 --> 02:31:24,124
l admit, l have made
a mistake Pooja

1311
02:31:25,159 --> 02:31:26,126
But my home was shattered too

1312
02:31:28,162 --> 02:31:30,130
You gave me a divorce and
severed your relationship with me

1313
02:31:31,165 --> 02:31:33,133
But you didn't give me even one
opportunity to explain

1314
02:31:37,171 --> 02:31:38,138
l didn't say a word then, Pooja...

1315
02:31:40,174 --> 02:31:41,141
because l thought
you were very angry

1316
02:31:43,177 --> 02:31:44,144
And your anger was justified

1317
02:31:46,180 --> 02:31:48,148
But you're still as angry
and obstinate as ever

1318
02:31:54,188 --> 02:31:56,156
You have no place for me
in your heart

1319
02:31:58,192 --> 02:32:00,160
One mistake, even God forgives

1320
02:32:01,195 --> 02:32:03,163
So go and seek forgiveness from God!
l can't forgive you. Never!

1321
02:32:05,199 --> 02:32:06,166
l can't forgive you. l can't.
Never

1322
02:32:30,224 --> 02:32:31,191
All right, Pooja

1323
02:32:37,231 --> 02:32:39,199
lf this is what you want,
l will not come in your way

1324
02:32:45,239 --> 02:32:47,207
l will not come between
the two of you

1325
02:32:52,246 --> 02:32:53,213
l think l must leave
this place

1326
02:32:58,252 --> 02:32:59,219
But l have promised the man
you're going to marry...

1327
02:33:03,257 --> 02:33:05,225
that l will decorate his wedding

1328
02:33:08,262 --> 02:33:09,229
You will no problems from me
during this wedding

1329
02:33:17,271 --> 02:33:19,239
Believe me or not...

1330
02:33:22,276 --> 02:33:24,244
from my heart will come
the best wishes for you

1331
02:33:27,281 --> 02:33:28,248
From my heart

1332
02:33:59,313 --> 02:34:00,280
Come on, guys

1333
02:34:27,341 --> 02:34:29,309
Why the tension, Mr Khanna?
- l have a problem, Raj

1334
02:34:32,346 --> 02:34:34,314
The guy who was supposed
to sing at your wedding,...

1335
02:34:35,349 --> 02:34:36,316
his flight has been cancelled

1336
02:34:37,351 --> 02:34:38,318
You're the only one who can
do something now. Save my skin!

1337
02:34:39,353 --> 02:34:40,320
You want me to sing?
- Yes

1338
02:34:42,356 --> 02:34:43,323
So everybody else runs away?
- Oh no

1339
02:34:46,360 --> 02:34:47,327
Ask one of the guests, producer

1340
02:34:50,364 --> 02:34:51,331
One of them must undoubtedly
have feeling in his voice

1341
02:34:53,367 --> 02:34:55,335
Why don't you sing, Sardarji?
- No! The bride will run away!

1342
02:35:00,374 --> 02:35:01,341
No, we don't want a song in Tamil

1343
02:35:06,380 --> 02:35:07,347
May l suggest something, Mr Raj?
- Go ahead

1344
02:35:08,382 --> 02:35:09,349
The manager has an amazing voice

1345
02:35:11,385 --> 02:35:12,352
lf his song doesn't make your
wedding greater, nothing will

1346
02:35:13,387 --> 02:35:14,354
Where is he?
- Who's that?

1347
02:35:18,392 --> 02:35:19,359
But where is he...?
Shiv saheb!

1348
02:35:24,398 --> 02:35:25,365
Here he is

1349
02:35:27,401 --> 02:35:28,368
Yes? ls everything okay?

1350
02:35:31,405 --> 02:35:32,372
Yes, everything is okay, but...

1351
02:35:35,409 --> 02:35:36,376
your secrets are being exposed

1352
02:35:41,415 --> 02:35:42,382
Pardon me?

1353
02:35:45,419 --> 02:35:47,387
You deserve praise for doing
a great job with my wedding

1354
02:35:49,423 --> 02:35:51,391
You have done me a great favour.
So please do me another

1355
02:35:53,427 --> 02:35:54,394
What?
- l'm told you have a great voice

1356
02:35:59,433 --> 02:36:01,401
The guy who was to be here to sing
won't be coming

1357
02:36:03,437 --> 02:36:05,405
So please sing something.
Something...

1358
02:36:06,440 --> 02:36:08,408
that will make me, my guests
and my bride... just sway!

1359
02:36:11,445 --> 02:36:12,412
We must remember nothing
except you!

1360
02:36:15,449 --> 02:36:16,416
What? Me?

1361
02:36:19,453 --> 02:36:21,421
Yes, you. Know what they call someone
who stands by you in such times?

1362
02:36:25,459 --> 02:36:26,426
The best friend. The friend...

1363
02:36:31,465 --> 02:36:32,432
who gives the bride away
to the bridegroom

1364
02:36:40,474 --> 02:36:42,442
Forget it. Sing something that
makes your voice a blessing for us

1365
02:36:49,483 --> 02:36:50,450
Please sing

1366
02:36:59,493 --> 02:37:01,461
''May the vermillion on your forehead
forever shine''

1367
02:37:24,518 --> 02:37:25,485
''May the henna on your palms,
forever be fragrant''

1368
02:37:26,520 --> 02:37:27,487
''May you forever be together''

1369
02:37:35,529 --> 02:37:37,497
''May your bangles
forever tinkle''

1370
02:37:56,550 --> 02:37:57,517
''Bless you, bless you''

1371
02:38:08,562 --> 02:38:09,529
''May your wedding be blessed''

1372
02:38:23,577 --> 02:38:25,545
''May you always be happy.
l pray for you''

1373
02:38:31,585 --> 02:38:33,553
''May the world kiss the earth
you tread on...''

1374
02:38:45,599 --> 02:38:47,567
''may you always be happy.
l pray for you''

1375
02:39:33,647 --> 02:39:34,614
''For you is the Spring''

1376
02:39:41,655 --> 02:39:42,622
''May you never face any sorrow''

1377
02:39:48,662 --> 02:39:49,629
''What is it about me?
l'm crazy''

1378
02:39:57,671 --> 02:39:58,638
''Nobody knows how l suffer''

1379
02:40:03,677 --> 02:40:04,644
''May you never have to
pine for love''

1380
02:40:18,692 --> 02:40:20,660
''May you always be happy.
l pray for you''

1381
02:41:24,758 --> 02:41:26,726
''Ties of a lifetime,
you can never sever''

1382
02:41:31,765 --> 02:41:32,732
''Midway through a journey,
you don't desert your companion''

1383
02:41:39,773 --> 02:41:40,740
''You mustn't ever forget
the norms''

1384
02:41:46,780 --> 02:41:47,747
''The vows you take, you must honour''

1385
02:41:53,787 --> 02:41:54,754
''l have spent a lifetime
in loneliness...''

1386
02:42:09,803 --> 02:42:11,771
''may you always be happy.
l pray for you''

1387
02:43:22,876 --> 02:43:23,843
''l have been in love too''

1388
02:43:32,886 --> 02:43:33,853
''Yes, l have also been in love''

1389
02:43:41,895 --> 02:43:42,862
''Yes, l have been in love''

1390
02:43:51,905 --> 02:43:52,872
''Yes, l have also been in love''

1391
02:44:19,933 --> 02:44:20,900
Pooja, come...
l'm here to take you along

1392
02:44:28,942 --> 02:44:30,910
The guests are waiting
for you downstairs

1393
02:44:34,948 --> 02:44:35,915
l have kept my promise

1394
02:44:39,953 --> 02:44:40,920
l have no complaints or regrets

1395
02:44:43,957 --> 02:44:44,924
l face no dilemma...
that you're leaving

1396
02:44:52,966 --> 02:44:54,934
Your bridegroom has sent me with
so much of love, to fetch you

1397
02:44:57,971 --> 02:44:58,938
As his best man.
As his best friend

1398
02:45:06,980 --> 02:45:08,948
Something like this must
never have happened before

1399
02:45:09,983 --> 02:45:11,951
Perhaps this is the
first time ever...

1400
02:45:15,989 --> 02:45:17,957
that a man is getting his wife
married to someone else

1401
02:45:30,003 --> 02:45:30,970
lt isn't a nice thing to happen

1402
02:45:34,007 --> 02:45:34,974
To punish you, l have punished myself

1403
02:45:39,012 --> 02:45:39,979
Why didn't l forgive you?

1404
02:45:43,016 --> 02:45:44,984
Despite the love l had for you...
why did l deny myself?

1405
02:45:50,023 --> 02:45:51,991
What am l to do, Shiv?
What am l to do?

1406
02:45:56,029 --> 02:45:57,997
The sacred fire around which
we took the vows...

1407
02:46:02,035 --> 02:46:04,003
now chars my heart! lt won't
let me erase your name

1408
02:46:07,040 --> 02:46:08,007
lt won't let your name
be erased

1409
02:46:15,048 --> 02:46:16,015
Pooja, Raj is waiting
for us downstairs

1410
02:46:25,058 --> 02:46:26,025
His guests are waiting for us.
We must go now

1411
02:46:29,062 --> 02:46:30,029
Come on

1412
02:47:10,103 --> 02:47:12,071
You knew Shiv and
didn't even tell me?

1413
02:47:20,113 --> 02:47:22,081
You knew each other...
and l didn't even get to know?

1414
02:47:29,122 --> 02:47:31,090
ls he the man you were married to?

1415
02:47:39,132 --> 02:47:41,100
ls he the man you have
never been able to forget?

1416
02:47:49,142 --> 02:47:51,110
So he's the one you loved
with all your heart

1417
02:47:58,151 --> 02:48:01,120
He's the one you wanted to punish,
and ended up punishing yourself

1418
02:48:17,170 --> 02:48:19,138
This story began between
the two of you

1419
02:48:22,175 --> 02:48:24,143
Will you decide its conclusion now?
Or must l do it?

1420
02:48:39,192 --> 02:48:41,160
l'm told it's difficult
for lovers to get together

1421
02:48:46,199 --> 02:48:48,167
As far as l know and feel...

1422
02:48:50,203 --> 02:48:52,171
l think the two of you
are made for each other

1423
02:48:56,209 --> 02:48:58,177
What is right and what is wrong,
what's true and what's not...

1424
02:49:04,217 --> 02:49:06,185
who ought to be punished,
who should be forgiven...?

1425
02:49:07,220 --> 02:49:09,188
mere mortals like us
can not decide

1426
02:49:11,224 --> 02:49:13,192
But yes, if there is anything
that can decide it...

1427
02:49:15,228 --> 02:49:16,195
it's the vows you take to remain
together for seven lifetimes

1428
02:49:20,233 --> 02:49:22,201
And every vow you take together.
Which you can't forget so easily

1429
02:49:30,243 --> 02:49:32,211
lt's true, Pooja. That's just why
you couldn't move any further

1430
02:49:36,249 --> 02:49:38,217
Your eyes could never see
the truth behind the norms

1431
02:49:42,255 --> 02:49:43,222
You can't love anyone but Shiv

1432
02:49:48,261 --> 02:49:50,229
Pooja, signatures on a piece of paper
don't make or break relationships

1433
02:49:56,269 --> 02:49:58,237
The name you write on your heart...

1434
02:49:59,272 --> 02:50:01,240
you can never erase
in a lifetime

1435
02:50:04,277 --> 02:50:06,245
And there's just one name
in your heart. Shiv's

1436
02:50:12,285 --> 02:50:13,252
When you severed your relationship...

1437
02:50:16,289 --> 02:50:18,257
there was no one to stop you
or reason with you

1438
02:50:22,295 --> 02:50:24,263
And see where it has taken
the two of you

1439
02:50:28,301 --> 02:50:30,269
Only the fortunate ones have
someone to lead you by hand

1440
02:50:36,309 --> 02:50:38,277
l'll show you the way
ou could never understand

1441
02:50:44,317 --> 02:50:46,285
l'll restore for good, this
relationship that had broken

1442
02:52:45,438 --> 02:52:47,406
l hope you had a comfortable stay
and a successful conference

1443
02:53:05,458 --> 02:53:06,425
What are you doing here?

1444
02:53:09,462 --> 02:53:11,430
You're the one who's surprising me!
lt's seven years since we last met

1445
02:53:14,467 --> 02:53:16,435
Seven years?

1446
02:53:19,472 --> 02:53:20,439
We studied together in college

1447
02:53:33,486 --> 02:53:35,454
He was always busy with
his studies and sports

1448
02:53:36,489 --> 02:53:38,457
Now that l see you, l realise that
he had a great eye for women

1449
02:53:40,493 --> 02:53:42,461
He reserved it for you

1450
02:53:53,506 --> 02:53:55,474
l'm here for a conference

1451
02:53:58,511 --> 02:53:59,478
You will eat, won't you?

1452
02:54:01,514 --> 02:54:02,481
Shall we go?
