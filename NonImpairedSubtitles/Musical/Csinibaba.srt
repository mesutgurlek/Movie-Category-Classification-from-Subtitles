1
00:00:45,005 --> 00:00:47,855
Could you close the door,
or the membrane will come in

2
00:00:48,004 --> 00:00:50,334
and the humidity in the mike
will be ruined.

3
00:00:50,484 --> 00:00:53,476
But I'll die in the steam
if you lock me in the washroom!

4
00:00:54,003 --> 00:00:54,992
Go on, close it.

5
00:00:56,483 --> 00:00:59,474
Good morning to you, blockmates.

6
00:01:00,522 --> 00:01:02,990
I wish you a fruitful working day

7
00:01:04,002 --> 00:01:05,992
on this pleasant summer morning.

8
00:01:06,521 --> 00:01:11,514
Today is August 28, 1962.
Nothing but sunshine.

9
00:01:12,520 --> 00:01:14,720
The temperature is normal
for the season.

10
00:01:16,519 --> 00:01:18,334
Announcement for this Saturday...

11
00:01:18,519 --> 00:01:20,169
For the workers' entertainment

12
00:01:20,999 --> 00:01:26,516
The National Defence Alliance
will be holding their Flying Day.

13
00:01:27,518 --> 00:01:31,510
I expect a large turnout
from all blockmates.

14
00:01:33,996 --> 00:01:35,987
To hell with these damn razors.

15
00:01:38,516 --> 00:01:40,983
Here is an announcement.

16
00:01:41,515 --> 00:01:45,985
The Politburo of the League of
Communist Youth

17
00:01:46,994 --> 00:01:48,507
is running a competition

18
00:01:48,994 --> 00:01:50,984
for those under the age of thirty.

19
00:01:51,673 --> 00:01:54,665
Who knows what,
what do I know... who knows?

20
00:01:55,673 --> 00:01:56,882
Go for it, youngsters!

21
00:01:57,672 --> 00:02:00,140
The situation of the winners...

22
00:02:00,672 --> 00:02:03,139
To travel to and mingle

23
00:02:03,671 --> 00:02:08,141
with the youth of the world
in Helsinki...

24
00:02:09,150 --> 00:02:11,141
at the World Youth Conference.

25
00:02:12,150 --> 00:02:14,140
Where the democratic youth

26
00:02:15,149 --> 00:02:17,663
will meet,
sing and then go home.

27
00:02:26,147 --> 00:02:26,947
Jenõ!

28
00:02:30,667 --> 00:02:31,766
What record is that?

29
00:02:32,146 --> 00:02:34,731
Mary Lou... Got it yesterday
at the flea market.

30
00:02:35,146 --> 00:02:36,658
Wow... How much?

31
00:02:37,145 --> 00:02:39,659
For forty... Don't pull it out.

32
00:02:40,665 --> 00:02:41,654
What's it like?

33
00:02:42,145 --> 00:02:43,133
Awesome...

34
00:02:44,664 --> 00:02:47,656
I haven't listened to it yet.
My dad's gramophone'd kill it.

35
00:02:50,143 --> 00:02:52,657
Now for another announcement.

36
00:02:53,663 --> 00:02:57,132
The winning lottery numbers are:

37
00:02:57,662 --> 00:03:03,657
4, 23, 28, 19...

38
00:03:07,140 --> 00:03:09,131
What? 56?

39
00:03:10,660 --> 00:03:11,648
How can that be?

40
00:03:13,139 --> 00:03:14,128
I just can't.

41
00:03:15,659 --> 00:03:19,128
The fifth number,
dear blockmates

42
00:03:19,658 --> 00:03:22,126
you can find
in Népszabadság.

43
00:03:27,657 --> 00:03:29,135
Isn't it wonderful, Aranka.

44
00:03:30,136 --> 00:03:32,650
that nothing has happened
for years.

45
00:03:33,136 --> 00:03:34,124
You're right...

46
00:03:36,135 --> 00:03:38,649
We haven't had a washing
machine for years either.

47
00:03:39,135 --> 00:03:41,125
We cry together,
we laugh together.

48
00:03:42,134 --> 00:03:45,323
We've no fanbelt, but we've got
the World Youth Conference.

49
00:03:45,653 --> 00:03:49,123
I wish it'd stay like this
for another thirty years.

50
00:03:50,133 --> 00:03:53,647
Relax, it will.
You can be sure of that.

51
00:03:54,652 --> 00:03:56,131
Gotta go now...

52
00:03:57,131 --> 00:03:58,120
Do my rounds.

53
00:03:59,131 --> 00:04:00,644
Go on, dear...

54
00:04:01,131 --> 00:04:03,644
Do the rounds
of your little empire.

55
00:04:05,650 --> 00:04:07,129
I'll go back to the washroom

56
00:04:07,650 --> 00:04:10,117
and destroy my lungs
with that good hot steam.

57
00:04:11,649 --> 00:04:12,449
Simon!

58
00:04:13,649 --> 00:04:14,448
The bucket.

59
00:04:16,128 --> 00:04:17,641
You forgot the bucket...

60
00:04:19,128 --> 00:04:20,640
You've got to get ice.

61
00:04:21,647 --> 00:04:22,636
Lots of it.

62
00:04:26,126 --> 00:04:29,118
Cos our quiet and well deserved
weekend is coming.

63
00:04:44,123 --> 00:04:48,638
I feel a bit low today,

64
00:04:51,122 --> 00:04:55,637
Unhappiness took over me a bit.

65
00:04:58,121 --> 00:05:00,634
I feel a bit like

66
00:05:01,640 --> 00:05:04,108
A sulky little kid

67
00:05:05,120 --> 00:05:10,113
Whose toy's been taken away.

68
00:05:12,118 --> 00:05:14,632
Why did they deduct 200 forints,
comrade?

69
00:05:15,118 --> 00:05:16,107
How unfair!

70
00:05:16,638 --> 00:05:19,629
They didn't give me overtime.

71
00:05:23,116 --> 00:05:27,632
I feel a bit low today,

72
00:05:30,115 --> 00:05:34,107
This lovely world got a bit cloudly.

73
00:05:36,634 --> 00:05:39,625
I've been screwed up a bit,

74
00:05:40,113 --> 00:05:43,105
but it's not the first time.

75
00:05:43,633 --> 00:05:48,626
My heart thinks of you
without anger.

76
00:05:51,631 --> 00:05:54,099
Come on, dear buddy.

77
00:05:54,631 --> 00:05:57,098
Cheer me up quick,

78
00:05:58,110 --> 00:06:02,103
See, I'm about to break down.

79
00:06:05,109 --> 00:06:07,623
Come on, dear guitar,

80
00:06:08,628 --> 00:06:11,096
I need a real song,

81
00:06:11,628 --> 00:06:16,621
To get rid of my complaints.

82
00:06:32,104 --> 00:06:36,620
I feel a bit low today,

83
00:06:39,103 --> 00:06:43,618
Unhappiness is new to me,

84
00:06:46,102 --> 00:06:48,615
I give myself a shake.

85
00:06:49,621 --> 00:06:52,089
You see, everything is fine,

86
00:06:53,101 --> 00:06:58,094
I look at you with my head high.

87
00:07:00,019 --> 00:07:01,008
Dear Attila...

88
00:07:01,539 --> 00:07:03,530
I'm sorry I haven't written before.

89
00:07:04,019 --> 00:07:06,532
We finally made it to Toronto
from Austria.

90
00:07:07,018 --> 00:07:10,010
Don't think that in two years
I've forgotten you.

91
00:07:12,017 --> 00:07:13,006
Katinka!

92
00:07:14,017 --> 00:07:17,008
She's been breathing good
Canadian air for years now.

93
00:07:18,536 --> 00:07:21,341
I wish I could breathe with you
there. And not here.

94
00:07:33,014 --> 00:07:35,213
Those who can recite poetry,
sing, dance.

95
00:07:36,013 --> 00:07:37,526
play music or do a comic act

96
00:07:38,533 --> 00:07:41,337
should register at the local
Communist Youth office.

97
00:07:41,532 --> 00:07:45,002
First prize: a trip to Helsinki,
to the World Youth Conference.

98
00:07:46,011 --> 00:07:46,811
That's it!

99
00:07:48,531 --> 00:07:50,010
Dear Katinka,

100
00:07:50,531 --> 00:07:55,001
It was in lunch break at the
factory when I made my decision.

101
00:07:56,010 --> 00:07:57,522
I can't write down what it is,

102
00:07:58,009 --> 00:08:00,924
all I can say is the air
you breathe gave me strength.

103
00:08:01,529 --> 00:08:03,893
Please give me your address.
Hugs, Attila...

104
00:08:04,528 --> 00:08:06,519
No, kisses, Attila.

105
00:08:09,007 --> 00:08:11,521
Uncle Pista!
Is Helsinki in the West?

106
00:08:12,527 --> 00:08:16,519
- West it is.
- How can you be so sure of that?

107
00:08:17,006 --> 00:08:18,519
It's more like North-West.

108
00:08:19,006 --> 00:08:20,996
East-West. It's up there.

109
00:08:22,005 --> 00:08:23,996
- Friendly.
- Semi-friendly.

110
00:08:24,525 --> 00:08:26,992
Helsinki's in the North.

111
00:08:33,523 --> 00:08:35,991
Why aren't you
in the factory canteen?

112
00:08:37,002 --> 00:08:38,515
It's pancakes.

113
00:08:40,002 --> 00:08:41,515
Haven't got a ticket.

114
00:08:42,002 --> 00:08:43,514
Do you like pancakes?

115
00:08:44,521 --> 00:08:46,989
Come on. I understand you.

116
00:08:48,001 --> 00:08:49,991
I see you got touched
by politics.

117
00:08:51,000 --> 00:08:53,514
Helsinki, right?

118
00:08:54,519 --> 00:08:57,511
Well, right now... it's the West,

119
00:08:58,519 --> 00:09:01,510
but there's a ferry
over to Leningrad.

120
00:09:02,518 --> 00:09:03,997
No thanks then...

121
00:09:04,518 --> 00:09:07,509
Today Attila Bánki,
semi-skilled worker,

122
00:09:07,997 --> 00:09:10,989
asked whether Helsinki
was in the West.

123
00:09:11,996 --> 00:09:14,510
The workers argued over this
at length

124
00:09:15,516 --> 00:09:18,507
meanwhile István Furman,
shop steward,

125
00:09:19,515 --> 00:09:25,510
put the bucket used for stubs
on worker Sándor Gáspár's head.

126
00:09:26,474 --> 00:09:30,989
The ensuing curses did not infer
incitement against the state.

127
00:09:31,993 --> 00:09:33,984
Ibolya, 4/4 subdivision,
Screw Factory.

128
00:09:34,472 --> 00:09:35,985
Date: two shots of moonshine.

129
00:09:37,472 --> 00:09:39,891
It says here the winners
will go to Helsinki.

130
00:09:40,471 --> 00:09:41,460
You get it?

131
00:09:41,991 --> 00:09:44,459
World Youth Conference.

132
00:09:45,470 --> 00:09:48,462
Some kind of huge Communist
Youth Meeting, right?

133
00:09:48,990 --> 00:09:50,981
Who cares?
Helsinki in the West.

134
00:09:51,989 --> 00:09:53,419
We get there and walk off.

135
00:09:53,989 --> 00:09:56,319
Screw their three years
of military service.

136
00:09:56,469 --> 00:09:57,457
You sure?

137
00:09:57,988 --> 00:09:59,467
It's in the paper.

138
00:10:05,467 --> 00:10:06,980
What are we good at?

139
00:10:07,467 --> 00:10:09,457
Nothing at all.

140
00:10:09,986 --> 00:10:10,975
Pop group!

141
00:10:11,466 --> 00:10:13,980
I feel a bit low today,

142
00:10:15,465 --> 00:10:17,979
Unhappiness is new to me,

143
00:10:18,985 --> 00:10:21,976
I shake myself a bit
You see, everything is fine

144
00:10:22,464 --> 00:10:24,455
I look at you with my head high.

145
00:10:28,983 --> 00:10:31,897
- What are we going to play?
- I'll go get some music.

146
00:10:32,462 --> 00:10:34,976
Let's pick up some chicks...

147
00:10:36,462 --> 00:10:37,974
We'll meet at the lake cafe...

148
00:10:38,981 --> 00:10:40,460
- Let's tell him too.
- Jenci!

149
00:10:43,460 --> 00:10:44,449
Have you heard?

150
00:10:45,980 --> 00:10:47,685
- World Youth Conference.
- WYC.

151
00:10:48,979 --> 00:10:50,458
Who? Stop a minute.

152
00:10:51,459 --> 00:10:52,972
You've got something there.

153
00:10:53,979 --> 00:10:55,457
What's in the bag?

154
00:10:58,978 --> 00:11:00,968
Thank you...

155
00:11:02,977 --> 00:11:04,968
Uncle Pista...

156
00:11:06,456 --> 00:11:08,970
Live happily ever after,

157
00:11:09,976 --> 00:11:11,454
with my blessing.

158
00:11:12,455 --> 00:11:17,448
He may stand all the rows.

159
00:11:18,974 --> 00:11:20,965
I'm leaving.

160
00:11:21,974 --> 00:11:23,964
I get off light,

161
00:11:24,973 --> 00:11:27,441
However hard I try,

162
00:11:27,973 --> 00:11:29,451
I'm not down.

163
00:11:30,972 --> 00:11:33,440
Now I'm finally free

164
00:11:33,972 --> 00:11:36,439
I'll live with no worries

165
00:11:37,451 --> 00:11:41,443
My surly baby
won't boss me around

166
00:11:42,450 --> 00:11:45,442
I suffered quite enough

167
00:11:46,449 --> 00:11:48,963
From tomorrow I'll laugh too

168
00:11:49,449 --> 00:11:52,963
Like all others,
it's better that way.

169
00:11:54,448 --> 00:11:58,440
Live happily for a hundred years

170
00:11:58,967 --> 00:12:00,958
You have my blessing

171
00:12:01,967 --> 00:12:06,960
He may stand all the rows.

172
00:12:07,966 --> 00:12:10,433
I'm leaving.

173
00:12:11,445 --> 00:12:13,436
I get off light,

174
00:12:13,965 --> 00:12:16,432
However hard I try,

175
00:12:16,964 --> 00:12:19,955
I'm not down.

176
00:12:23,963 --> 00:12:24,952
It's Saturday...

177
00:12:34,441 --> 00:12:35,430
You cad!

178
00:12:42,440 --> 00:12:44,953
- Hi, I'm Etelka.
- I'm Olga.

179
00:12:45,439 --> 00:12:47,199
- Shall we have a Bambi?
- Great.

180
00:12:48,439 --> 00:12:50,952
- Two Bambis, please, with a straw.
- Right away.

181
00:12:51,958 --> 00:12:53,949
What do you think?
A little romance?

182
00:12:54,957 --> 00:12:56,436
Maybe. Relax.

183
00:12:56,957 --> 00:12:58,772
Play it cool... That's the point.

184
00:12:59,437 --> 00:13:00,425
Summer's so good...

185
00:13:01,956 --> 00:13:04,948
- Everything's full of love.
- And disappointment.

186
00:13:05,436 --> 00:13:08,405
- Mine's the ponytail, yours is
the beehive. - No away.

187
00:13:08,955 --> 00:13:11,422
- Then you say hello.
- The ponytail is yours.

188
00:13:13,994 --> 00:13:19,431
Watch it... Play it cool.

189
00:13:27,952 --> 00:13:29,464
I don't think we've met.

190
00:13:29,951 --> 00:13:32,321
- I don't meet people this way.
- Me neither.

191
00:13:32,471 --> 00:13:33,950
Kuno Purábl, at your service.

192
00:13:34,950 --> 00:13:37,942
I got goosebumps already.
I'm going to be a ballerina.

193
00:13:39,470 --> 00:13:41,229
I can only contemplate marriage.

194
00:13:42,469 --> 00:13:44,834
Can I show you
my most treasured possession?

195
00:13:45,469 --> 00:13:47,943
- No. - Your wish is my command.
- What is it?

196
00:13:48,468 --> 00:13:50,173
Have you seen anything like it?

197
00:13:50,948 --> 00:13:53,367
What's the velvet for?
Is it expensive stuff?

198
00:13:53,947 --> 00:13:55,938
- Priceless.
- Is it from abroad?

199
00:13:56,467 --> 00:13:57,945
May I take it out?

200
00:13:58,946 --> 00:14:00,459
Do you know what it is?

201
00:14:04,945 --> 00:14:05,745
Pig!

202
00:14:09,464 --> 00:14:10,943
I beg your pardon.

203
00:14:15,943 --> 00:14:16,932
What was it?

204
00:14:21,942 --> 00:14:24,934
Gosh... and I almost touched it.

205
00:14:27,461 --> 00:14:29,929
Those were MIGs
and I didn't even see them.

206
00:14:32,460 --> 00:14:33,939
They're American cigarettes.

207
00:14:36,460 --> 00:14:37,938
Look... American cigarettes.

208
00:14:40,939 --> 00:14:42,929
Damn, it's a Chesterfield.

209
00:14:46,938 --> 00:14:47,927
How masculine.

210
00:14:48,937 --> 00:14:50,928
They say there's cocaine in them.

211
00:14:51,457 --> 00:14:54,926
Coca-cola has opium and
sex is porn, my dad said.

212
00:14:55,936 --> 00:14:56,925
Manci's here!

213
00:15:01,455 --> 00:15:03,923
- She's cheating on me.
- You two going out?

214
00:15:04,455 --> 00:15:06,445
What can you see, Mr. Bajkon?

215
00:15:07,934 --> 00:15:09,447
Manci, you tricked me.

216
00:15:10,454 --> 00:15:13,303
Could you tell Angéla
she can look into my telescope?

217
00:15:13,453 --> 00:15:15,444
Can I take a look too?

218
00:15:15,933 --> 00:15:17,445
Of course. Even at home.

219
00:15:17,932 --> 00:15:20,924
After all you only live
ten paces away from me.

220
00:15:21,452 --> 00:15:25,444
But my dream is that
she will take a peak one day.

221
00:15:26,451 --> 00:15:29,442
Angéla! Will you look
into Mr. Bajkon's telescope?

222
00:15:30,450 --> 00:15:32,918
I'm not in the mood,
how about later?

223
00:15:33,450 --> 00:15:34,928
Alright... When exactly?

224
00:15:35,449 --> 00:15:36,928
Hi... The music.

225
00:15:40,448 --> 00:15:41,713
So? Did you discuss it?

226
00:15:42,448 --> 00:15:44,439
- I'm in.
- Who will sing?

227
00:15:45,927 --> 00:15:46,916
Attila.

228
00:15:47,447 --> 00:15:50,439
- Why him?
- He's dying to meet his girlfriend.

229
00:15:51,447 --> 00:15:53,921
- I want to get out of here too.
- Don't yell.

230
00:15:54,446 --> 00:15:56,296
The singer always gets
the best chicks.

231
00:15:56,446 --> 00:15:59,295
- So three guitars and the drums.
- I play the guitar.

232
00:15:59,445 --> 00:16:00,775
- Me too.
- We need a drummer.

233
00:16:00,925 --> 00:16:02,915
Guys, if we pull this off

234
00:16:03,444 --> 00:16:07,437
I'm off to Brazil
to eat bananas

235
00:16:08,444 --> 00:16:09,432
non-stop.

236
00:17:09,353 --> 00:17:12,822
Mr. Bajkon... Mr. Bajkon...

237
00:17:16,352 --> 00:17:17,830
Here's your chance to cut in

238
00:17:18,351 --> 00:17:19,830
and dance with Angéla.

239
00:17:20,351 --> 00:17:22,342
Cut in, out? Look, Manci,

240
00:17:22,831 --> 00:17:26,345
my affection isn't
a rollercoaster.

241
00:17:39,988 --> 00:17:41,087
Son, are you hungry?

242
00:17:41,987 --> 00:17:43,978
Bananas... I want bananas, Ma.

243
00:17:44,987 --> 00:17:46,801
Where the hell can I get bananas?

244
00:17:46,986 --> 00:17:48,977
Your hair's long.
Get it cut tomorrow.

245
00:18:01,544 --> 00:18:03,056
I count to three...

246
00:18:04,583 --> 00:18:05,383
Three!

247
00:18:05,543 --> 00:18:07,534
Good day, blockmates.

248
00:18:08,063 --> 00:18:12,533
I see the Flying Day is going well.

249
00:18:13,062 --> 00:18:13,912
But it's not over yet.

250
00:18:14,062 --> 00:18:25,050
- Could we be on familiar terms?
- Who do you think you are?

251
00:18:25,580 --> 00:18:27,909
Just because I danced with you,
you can molest me?

252
00:18:28,059 --> 00:18:30,573
But I only touched
your knee bone.

253
00:18:31,059 --> 00:18:34,050
Jesus Christ!
What are you? A butcher?

254
00:18:35,058 --> 00:18:36,047
I just...

255
00:18:36,578 --> 00:18:38,777
- You just handle the paddles.
- Will do.

256
00:18:39,057 --> 00:18:41,571
- What are you doing?
- We've cleaving the waves.

257
00:18:42,057 --> 00:18:45,571
Full tilt. What's the water like?
Would you like to have a splash?

258
00:18:46,056 --> 00:18:48,570
Come on, exert yourself,
once you've invited me.

259
00:18:55,494 --> 00:18:56,973
Just a moment.

260
00:18:59,494 --> 00:19:00,482
What is it?

261
00:19:01,493 --> 00:19:02,972
Couldn't we do it now?

262
00:19:03,493 --> 00:19:04,293
What?

263
00:19:06,972 --> 00:19:09,964
Ah... I'm on inspection now.

264
00:19:11,492 --> 00:19:13,482
All right, then next time.

265
00:19:15,491 --> 00:19:17,958
Bye, I'll lock the gates
at 11 pm.

266
00:19:20,490 --> 00:19:22,958
Comrades, I've brought
the directives.

267
00:19:26,969 --> 00:19:31,962
Comrades!
I've brought the directives.

268
00:19:32,968 --> 00:19:34,958
- Who are you?
- I'm Ede...

269
00:19:35,967 --> 00:19:38,277
- Where am I?
- Where do you think you are?

270
00:19:38,967 --> 00:19:42,481
- In the Pioneers' Stadium.
- You got a bit lost, young man.

271
00:19:43,486 --> 00:19:45,953
- Are you Hungarians?
- Course we are, buddy.

272
00:19:46,485 --> 00:19:48,476
Hungarians from Hungary?

273
00:19:49,485 --> 00:19:51,952
Don't worry, we're absolute
Hungarians.

274
00:19:52,484 --> 00:19:54,475
Did you hurt yourself, Ede?

275
00:19:54,964 --> 00:19:57,477
- How do you know my name?
- You just told us.

276
00:19:58,963 --> 00:20:00,954
Where am I? They'll look for me.

277
00:20:01,483 --> 00:20:03,950
Relax buddy... You're safe here.

278
00:20:04,962 --> 00:20:08,332
I'm relaxed. The Defense Alliance
will come for me like lightning.

279
00:20:08,482 --> 00:20:09,470
Got a cigarette?

280
00:20:11,961 --> 00:20:13,952
- Our drummer.
- Let's keep him here.

281
00:20:14,481 --> 00:20:16,948
Could you bring me two Bambis
and two iced cakes.

282
00:20:17,960 --> 00:20:19,473
Two? You mean...

283
00:20:20,959 --> 00:20:23,489
- May I invite you?
- I'll get them right away.

284
00:20:23,959 --> 00:20:25,472
Are you a drummer?

285
00:20:26,478 --> 00:20:27,467
Are you kidding?

286
00:20:29,478 --> 00:20:32,469
- Wanna be in our group?
- Come with us to the WYC.

287
00:20:32,957 --> 00:20:36,472
Might as well. I'll come
till they come and get me.

288
00:20:37,476 --> 00:20:38,576
I'm off to rehearse.

289
00:20:39,476 --> 00:20:40,955
Manci's leaving!

290
00:20:41,956 --> 00:20:44,469
I'm interested in those directives

291
00:20:45,475 --> 00:20:48,944
which were the reason
you flew in here.

292
00:20:49,474 --> 00:20:50,953
Here you go, buddy.

293
00:20:54,474 --> 00:20:56,464
Manci, are you going?

294
00:20:56,953 --> 00:20:59,467
To the movies.
And I have to fix my hair.

295
00:20:59,953 --> 00:21:02,944
On this hot summer evening?

296
00:21:03,472 --> 00:21:05,463
They open the ceiling
at the Szikra.

297
00:21:06,471 --> 00:21:08,121
- What if I...
- It's sold out.

298
00:21:08,471 --> 00:21:10,671
- And tomorrow?
- I'm going tomorrow too.

299
00:21:10,951 --> 00:21:13,464
So may I catch a last glimpse
of you today?

300
00:21:13,950 --> 00:21:15,941
Well, quickly then.
Are you an artist?

301
00:21:22,469 --> 00:21:25,938
The moon is trembling
on the water

302
00:21:26,468 --> 00:21:30,460
The light throws
pure silver flames

303
00:21:31,467 --> 00:21:37,462
How often I've walked here alone

304
00:21:38,466 --> 00:21:41,457
Secretly my heart is waiting

305
00:21:42,465 --> 00:21:45,935
To find you here once again

306
00:21:46,944 --> 00:21:50,937
But only the mocking autumn wind
plays its music.

307
00:21:51,464 --> 00:21:53,454
This song is about us, Katinka.

308
00:21:54,463 --> 00:21:58,455
Before we met at the lake,

309
00:21:59,462 --> 00:22:02,932
Dreamed here at the lake

310
00:22:03,461 --> 00:22:07,932
On a moonlit summer night

311
00:22:08,461 --> 00:22:09,939
You and me.

312
00:22:10,460 --> 00:22:13,930
The moon is trembling
on the water

313
00:22:14,460 --> 00:22:17,451
The light throws pure silver flames

314
00:22:17,939 --> 00:22:21,931
I walk here alone again.

315
00:22:22,458 --> 00:22:24,926
"Dreamed here, at the lake,
you and me,

316
00:22:25,938 --> 00:22:27,928
on a moonlit summer night."

317
00:22:28,457 --> 00:22:29,446
Are you rehearsing?

318
00:22:30,937 --> 00:22:33,450
Talent contest, Helsinki...
I pay attention.

319
00:22:35,456 --> 00:22:37,923
Do you have any relatives
living abroad?

320
00:22:38,935 --> 00:22:40,448
I've no relatives at all.

321
00:22:40,935 --> 00:22:44,449
Any acquaintances?
We'll look into it anyway.

322
00:22:45,934 --> 00:22:47,925
I used to perform a lot
in the past.

323
00:22:48,934 --> 00:22:50,198
Didn't my son tell you?

324
00:22:50,933 --> 00:22:52,363
I used to be on the stage.

325
00:22:52,933 --> 00:22:54,446
But the Movement, you know...

326
00:22:54,932 --> 00:22:57,446
Jenõ said you worked
for the secret police...

327
00:22:58,452 --> 00:23:00,919
Shouldn't we head back home?

328
00:23:01,451 --> 00:23:04,443
It's late.

329
00:23:05,451 --> 00:23:08,442
the lake is asleep

330
00:23:09,450 --> 00:23:13,920
and a cool wind
blows through the leaves.

331
00:23:17,449 --> 00:23:20,440
A yellow leaf

332
00:23:20,928 --> 00:23:23,919
rustles to the ground...

333
00:23:25,447 --> 00:23:30,440
...And I sadly watch in silence.

334
00:23:35,925 --> 00:23:37,916
Now a shaded one...

335
00:23:38,925 --> 00:23:39,914
Wow, that's good...

336
00:23:40,924 --> 00:23:42,437
That's very shaded.

337
00:23:48,443 --> 00:23:50,434
In a second, Ede...
stop fidgeting.

338
00:23:53,442 --> 00:23:54,921
Would you pose nude?

339
00:23:55,442 --> 00:23:57,433
I really must go.

340
00:24:00,441 --> 00:24:01,430
Time is racing

341
00:24:02,441 --> 00:24:04,431
We've been together so long.

342
00:24:05,440 --> 00:24:07,908
- You touched me again!
- It's dark, I can't see.

343
00:24:08,440 --> 00:24:10,907
- You can still feel things.
- That's all I do.

344
00:24:11,439 --> 00:24:16,432
Or should I stop rowing?
There, I'll put them down.

345
00:24:17,438 --> 00:24:19,906
Pick them up and let's
gurgle to the mooring.

346
00:24:20,438 --> 00:24:23,907
Just because it's summer and the
weekend... I work in three shifts.

347
00:24:25,437 --> 00:24:26,915
Why are you so het up?

348
00:24:27,436 --> 00:24:29,427
Did I ask you to marry me?

349
00:24:29,916 --> 00:24:32,429
Marry such a hairy man
with sideboards!

350
00:24:32,915 --> 00:24:33,904
We're sinking.

351
00:24:34,915 --> 00:24:37,429
We're not. The water's rising.

352
00:24:37,914 --> 00:24:40,428
It's a full moon, high tide.

353
00:24:41,434 --> 00:24:43,901
So you're a sailor too.
You said you were a boxer.

354
00:24:44,913 --> 00:24:46,904
IDs, please, and good evening.

355
00:24:49,432 --> 00:24:50,911
Ernesztin! Is that you?

356
00:24:51,432 --> 00:24:53,900
Simon! You, here?

357
00:24:54,911 --> 00:24:56,424
It's twelve years since...

358
00:24:57,911 --> 00:24:59,424
You must be Jenõ.

359
00:25:00,431 --> 00:25:02,421
You were a little baby when...

360
00:25:02,910 --> 00:25:04,901
Give me a kiss.

361
00:25:06,429 --> 00:25:09,759
My son's friend.
Go home, but first to the barber.

362
00:25:09,909 --> 00:25:12,422
You seem moved.

363
00:25:14,428 --> 00:25:16,896
It's nothing. Just the memories
flooding back.

364
00:25:17,428 --> 00:25:18,416
On patrol?

365
00:25:19,427 --> 00:25:21,187
I'm after a pervert around here.

366
00:25:21,907 --> 00:25:22,896
With a coat?

367
00:25:23,426 --> 00:25:24,415
With a suitcase.

368
00:25:25,426 --> 00:25:27,894
Don't you want to patrol with me?
Like old times.

369
00:25:28,906 --> 00:25:30,896
Are you lukewarm or hot?

370
00:25:32,425 --> 00:25:33,414
Remember?

371
00:25:33,905 --> 00:25:34,705
Yes.

372
00:25:35,904 --> 00:25:37,417
We were dizzy, Simon...

373
00:25:37,904 --> 00:25:41,418
I could tear apart these chains
with my bare chest

374
00:25:42,423 --> 00:25:43,412
if you'd say yes.

375
00:25:43,903 --> 00:25:44,892
Let's see!

376
00:25:46,422 --> 00:25:47,411
Kiss me first.

377
00:25:49,422 --> 00:25:50,222
After perhaps.

378
00:25:51,422 --> 00:25:54,413
Show me something, you hero,
now that my evening

379
00:25:54,901 --> 00:25:56,414
is ruined.

380
00:26:01,420 --> 00:26:03,410
Not on my arms.

381
00:26:10,058 --> 00:26:11,488
Keeps you out of mischief.

382
00:26:20,576 --> 00:26:24,569
I want to be a ballerina. I only
look plump because of my hair.

383
00:26:25,056 --> 00:26:28,047
No, you've a lovely figure,
like a spool.

384
00:26:30,055 --> 00:26:31,568
You rude little drummer.

385
00:26:32,574 --> 00:26:34,053
Big drummer... You heard.

386
00:26:36,054 --> 00:26:38,308
I'll be the drummer.
I'm going to the WYC.

387
00:26:40,573 --> 00:26:41,562
Can I sit closer?

388
00:26:42,053 --> 00:26:44,043
Don't be a beast!

389
00:26:44,572 --> 00:26:45,837
I've only just met you.

390
00:26:46,572 --> 00:26:48,051
You know

391
00:26:48,572 --> 00:26:52,041
the female soul is a sensitive
instrument. Not a drum.

392
00:26:53,051 --> 00:26:54,040
Etelka.

393
00:26:55,570 --> 00:26:58,562
Do you know that song
"Perhaps in a moment..."

394
00:26:59,570 --> 00:27:01,048
I was humming it all day.

395
00:27:01,569 --> 00:27:04,037
"Perhaps in a moment,
perhaps in a year

396
00:27:04,569 --> 00:27:07,560
- I will win you ever..."
- I can't stand it any longer.

397
00:27:08,568 --> 00:27:10,559
Ede! I have to ask you...

398
00:27:12,567 --> 00:27:15,035
- Let's be on familiar terms.
- Etelka!

399
00:27:34,084 --> 00:27:35,562
My pleated skirt!

400
00:27:36,083 --> 00:27:39,553
What have you done? What do
I look like? My only dress.

401
00:27:40,563 --> 00:27:43,076
My cigarettes!
My Chesterfields are soaked.

402
00:27:44,082 --> 00:27:46,549
You deserve it. Stupid idiot.
Butcher!

403
00:27:49,561 --> 00:27:51,074
Don't swim away.

404
00:27:52,080 --> 00:27:54,071
We'll build a nest.

405
00:27:55,560 --> 00:27:57,551
This is a strange night,

406
00:27:59,079 --> 00:28:00,068
don't you think so?

407
00:28:01,559 --> 00:28:04,072
Yeah... but why do you think so?

408
00:28:05,078 --> 00:28:07,069
I'm usually asleep by this hour.

409
00:28:09,557 --> 00:28:12,071
- But somehow I can't sleep now.
- Me neither.

410
00:28:12,557 --> 00:28:14,070
See what he's like.

411
00:28:15,076 --> 00:28:17,544
Always following me
five paces away.

412
00:28:18,076 --> 00:28:20,544
- Never closer.
- I couldn't.

413
00:28:21,075 --> 00:28:22,554
You're a saint. I...

414
00:28:23,555 --> 00:28:26,069
You're unbelievable...

415
00:28:27,074 --> 00:28:31,067
From now on I'll keep
ten paces away.

416
00:28:32,074 --> 00:28:35,543
Every guy in eighth grade
was in love with me,

417
00:28:36,073 --> 00:28:38,063
while you chose Katinka.

418
00:28:38,552 --> 00:28:40,065
I stepped into something.

419
00:28:40,552 --> 00:28:43,066
Don't walk about,
stay in one place.

420
00:28:43,551 --> 00:28:45,542
Then I stay in what
I stepped into.

421
00:28:47,071 --> 00:28:49,538
Is that why you entered
the Talent contest,

422
00:28:50,070 --> 00:28:51,549
to go after her?

423
00:28:52,070 --> 00:28:52,870
Quieter!

424
00:28:53,550 --> 00:28:57,064
Could you talk a bit louder,
I can't hear.

425
00:28:57,549 --> 00:28:59,540
You haven't had a letter
in four years.

426
00:29:00,069 --> 00:29:02,536
You think she's still
waiting for you?

427
00:29:03,548 --> 00:29:06,539
You wouldn't understand.
Do you know what love is?

428
00:29:08,067 --> 00:29:10,058
- I do.
- Me too.

429
00:29:11,547 --> 00:29:13,537
How do you know it was four years?

430
00:29:15,546 --> 00:29:17,059
Hello, mermaid-baby!

431
00:29:18,065 --> 00:29:19,544
Don't stand there. Help!

432
00:29:20,065 --> 00:29:21,544
Did you fall in?

433
00:29:22,065 --> 00:29:24,055
I got soaked. My dress is ruined.

434
00:29:25,064 --> 00:29:26,384
What are you staring at?

435
00:29:27,064 --> 00:29:28,543
Why are you so formal?

436
00:29:29,543 --> 00:29:30,808
The night is before us.

437
00:29:31,543 --> 00:29:34,623
I got a cool record. We could
listen to it at your place.

438
00:29:35,062 --> 00:29:37,053
Along with the doorman.
Go to hell.

439
00:29:38,062 --> 00:29:38,862
Doorman?

440
00:29:39,542 --> 00:29:40,911
Are you from the police too?

441
00:29:41,061 --> 00:29:44,531
That's my luck.
First a butcher, then an idiot.

442
00:29:45,541 --> 00:29:46,529
What a night...

443
00:29:48,060 --> 00:29:50,051
Could you send me a locksmith?

444
00:29:51,060 --> 00:29:52,049
You left me.

445
00:29:52,539 --> 00:29:55,531
When I was almost
rid of my chains.

446
00:29:56,059 --> 00:29:59,050
You had a son by then.
I couldn't break up your marriage.

447
00:29:59,538 --> 00:30:02,052
You only saw the woman in me.
Admit it!

448
00:30:03,538 --> 00:30:05,050
Me? The woman in you?

449
00:30:05,537 --> 00:30:07,050
That's impossible!

450
00:30:09,057 --> 00:30:11,916
You could never look on me
as your section commander.

451
00:30:12,536 --> 00:30:14,049
You just kept dreaming in '48,

452
00:30:14,536 --> 00:30:17,049
while I was full of energy
and ready for action.

453
00:30:18,055 --> 00:30:19,905
You were really tender that night.

454
00:30:20,055 --> 00:30:23,046
Our tears were streaming.
Remember?

455
00:30:26,054 --> 00:30:27,532
It was a strange night.

456
00:30:30,053 --> 00:30:32,520
We sealed both sides
of Margaret Island

457
00:30:34,052 --> 00:30:36,043
to catch that black market gang.

458
00:30:36,532 --> 00:30:39,523
And it was so dark
we couldn't see them.

459
00:30:41,251 --> 00:30:43,764
It was a strange night,

460
00:30:44,770 --> 00:30:47,762
The island belonged to you and me,

461
00:30:48,250 --> 00:30:53,243
No one walked on the promenade.

462
00:30:54,249 --> 00:30:57,763
Gentle music was playing,

463
00:30:58,248 --> 00:31:01,239
We just watched the water,

464
00:31:01,767 --> 00:31:07,238
Both waiting for a word.

465
00:31:08,246 --> 00:31:11,238
Then suddenly, without warning,

466
00:31:11,766 --> 00:31:14,757
You came closer

467
00:31:15,765 --> 00:31:20,235
Until your lips touched mine.

468
00:31:20,365 --> 00:31:22,235
Blockmates!

469
00:31:22,244 --> 00:31:25,235
Since then I feel

470
00:31:25,763 --> 00:31:28,231
whatever the future brings

471
00:31:29,243 --> 00:31:35,237
It was worth living for that.

472
00:31:35,761 --> 00:31:38,753
What a night it was

473
00:31:39,761 --> 00:31:42,752
Lights were swimming
on the Danube

474
00:31:43,240 --> 00:31:48,233
Like playful paper boats

475
00:31:49,759 --> 00:31:52,750
The moon was our only witness

476
00:31:53,238 --> 00:31:56,230
And the lights on the Danube

477
00:31:56,758 --> 00:32:01,751
Saw our very first kiss.

478
00:32:03,756 --> 00:32:06,224
Careful, I can swim,
but I don't remember how.

479
00:32:17,794 --> 00:32:20,262
Evening!
Transfer or a through ticket?

480
00:32:22,793 --> 00:32:24,784
How may I address you, milady?

481
00:32:26,792 --> 00:32:29,542
Are you drunk? I've no time.
This is the depot run.

482
00:32:31,272 --> 00:32:33,581
You stand before me
with your tight uniform

483
00:32:34,271 --> 00:32:35,784
and your nice hairy legs.

484
00:32:37,791 --> 00:32:40,540
You arouse me on this
flower-scented summer evening

485
00:32:41,270 --> 00:32:43,783
and you won't even
tell me your name.

486
00:32:45,789 --> 00:32:47,780
It's Terezia if you must know.

487
00:32:49,269 --> 00:32:50,068
Terike!

488
00:32:51,268 --> 00:32:54,260
May I call you that tonight?
While we travel together.

489
00:32:55,267 --> 00:32:58,259
If you like...
But you won't cheat on the fare.

490
00:32:59,267 --> 00:33:00,780
I wouldn't think of it.

491
00:33:01,786 --> 00:33:04,254
But I've noticed

492
00:33:05,266 --> 00:33:06,778
on closer inspection

493
00:33:08,785 --> 00:33:10,435
that you're not wearing pants.

494
00:33:12,784 --> 00:33:13,584
What?

495
00:33:14,264 --> 00:33:15,777
As I said.

496
00:33:17,784 --> 00:33:19,774
I'll order you off the tram.

497
00:33:20,263 --> 00:33:22,254
It's no sin, the heat is awful.

498
00:33:22,783 --> 00:33:23,772
It's no shame.

499
00:33:24,782 --> 00:33:27,250
You're mistaken.
I am wearing them.

500
00:33:28,262 --> 00:33:29,774
Well... cheers.

501
00:33:33,781 --> 00:33:36,248
Are you crazy?
Do you know where you are?

502
00:33:36,780 --> 00:33:37,769
Of course.

503
00:33:38,260 --> 00:33:42,252
On one of the overhead tramways,
electric,

504
00:33:43,779 --> 00:33:46,247
alone with you.

505
00:33:51,258 --> 00:33:52,247
Come on,

506
00:33:53,257 --> 00:33:54,246
cheers...

507
00:33:55,777 --> 00:33:56,766
Sit down, Terike.

508
00:33:57,257 --> 00:33:58,769
It's not allowed.

509
00:34:01,256 --> 00:34:02,056
Oh well...

510
00:34:02,776 --> 00:34:04,535
This is a pretty exhausting job.

511
00:34:05,255 --> 00:34:06,768
To your health!

512
00:34:12,254 --> 00:34:13,959
Seen anything like this before?

513
00:34:14,774 --> 00:34:15,573
Yes.

514
00:34:17,253 --> 00:34:19,244
Do you know what it is?

515
00:34:21,772 --> 00:34:23,251
Don't expect me to say.

516
00:34:24,772 --> 00:34:27,239
My most treasured possession.

517
00:34:27,771 --> 00:34:30,239
All men say that. Pig!

518
00:34:34,770 --> 00:34:38,239
Don't provoke me.
Buy your ticket right now.

519
00:34:39,769 --> 00:34:42,237
Later...
when you're properly dressed.

520
00:34:44,248 --> 00:34:45,048
Look...

521
00:34:45,768 --> 00:34:48,518
I admit I'm wearing only
socks because of the heat.

522
00:34:49,248 --> 00:34:50,236
And further up?

523
00:34:51,247 --> 00:34:54,762
Panties. And a bra and slip too.

524
00:34:55,247 --> 00:34:56,235
I remember...

525
00:34:56,766 --> 00:34:58,245
I put them on at noon.

526
00:34:59,766 --> 00:35:02,757
I'd like to,
but I can't believe you.

527
00:35:03,245 --> 00:35:04,234
I'm sorry.

528
00:35:06,245 --> 00:35:08,235
No one has ever accused me
of lying,

529
00:35:09,244 --> 00:35:11,235
and I won't take it
from you either.

530
00:35:14,763 --> 00:35:17,231
What do you say to these?

531
00:35:18,762 --> 00:35:20,753
It's some sort of trick.

532
00:35:21,242 --> 00:35:22,231
A trick?

533
00:35:23,242 --> 00:35:25,232
Do you want me
to show you the rest?

534
00:35:25,761 --> 00:35:28,229
If you feel so strongly
about the truth...

535
00:35:28,761 --> 00:35:30,751
and it comes from within.

536
00:35:31,240 --> 00:35:32,040
It does.

537
00:35:34,760 --> 00:35:36,238
Then show me if you like.

538
00:35:37,239 --> 00:35:38,228
I won't turn away.

539
00:35:39,239 --> 00:35:40,394
I'll face it bravely.

540
00:35:58,995 --> 00:36:00,095
What do you say now?

541
00:36:02,515 --> 00:36:03,993
Terminal station!

542
00:36:04,514 --> 00:36:05,993
What are you doing?

543
00:36:06,514 --> 00:36:07,993
I just... I

544
00:36:08,994 --> 00:36:10,506
The passenger claimed...

545
00:36:12,993 --> 00:36:14,506
All women are whores.

546
00:36:22,031 --> 00:36:22,856
Good evening...

547
00:36:30,030 --> 00:36:32,021
Give me a double Johnnie Walker.

548
00:36:32,509 --> 00:36:33,309
Instead?

549
00:36:34,029 --> 00:36:35,508
Anything... that does harm.

550
00:36:36,509 --> 00:36:38,022
In a tough glass.

551
00:36:41,028 --> 00:36:42,017
Plum brandy.

552
00:36:48,507 --> 00:36:49,307
Cops?

553
00:36:51,026 --> 00:36:51,826
Act.

554
00:36:53,506 --> 00:36:55,019
What are the chains for?

555
00:36:56,025 --> 00:36:56,825
Virtue.

556
00:36:57,025 --> 00:36:58,504
You didn't succeed...

557
00:36:59,025 --> 00:37:01,354
- Nope. - Is there someone
to take them off?

558
00:37:01,504 --> 00:37:03,017
I've got used to them.

559
00:37:04,504 --> 00:37:07,495
Your jacket looks wet,
you'll catch a cold.

560
00:37:09,023 --> 00:37:11,014
Are you some kind of strong man?

561
00:37:11,503 --> 00:37:14,494
I was Boston's Caesar.

562
00:37:15,022 --> 00:37:18,491
I knocked out 100 kg black guys.

563
00:37:19,021 --> 00:37:20,010
Boxer...

564
00:37:21,021 --> 00:37:22,010
Where's Boston?

565
00:37:23,021 --> 00:37:24,499
Damn far.

566
00:37:25,500 --> 00:37:29,015
I had a chauffeur-driven
yellow Cadillac.

567
00:37:30,499 --> 00:37:32,490
I came home in '48...

568
00:37:34,019 --> 00:37:35,497
My name's Margit.

569
00:37:38,018 --> 00:37:40,486
You know what?
Tear those chains apart.

570
00:37:44,017 --> 00:37:45,496
Attention, please.

571
00:37:46,017 --> 00:37:48,007
Here is Boston's Caesar

572
00:37:49,016 --> 00:37:53,008
who will tear apart his chains
with his unparalleled strength.

573
00:37:54,015 --> 00:37:55,494
It won't work.

574
00:37:56,015 --> 00:37:57,004
Don't say that.

575
00:37:58,015 --> 00:38:01,006
Tell yourself you sent 100 kg.
black guys to the floor.

576
00:38:01,494 --> 00:38:04,008
These chains are nothing
in comparison.

577
00:38:04,493 --> 00:38:06,006
That's right...

578
00:38:06,493 --> 00:38:08,484
These are lousy boat chains.

579
00:38:09,013 --> 00:38:11,003
- I can do it!
- That's it.

580
00:38:12,012 --> 00:38:13,001
Attention.

581
00:38:14,492 --> 00:38:15,292
Now.

582
00:38:33,688 --> 00:38:34,843
Sorry, it won't work.

583
00:38:36,208 --> 00:38:37,687
Something's broken inside me.

584
00:38:38,208 --> 00:38:42,200
I'm a jerk. I should have left
when it was still possible.

585
00:38:43,207 --> 00:38:45,197
If you could leave, would you?

586
00:38:45,686 --> 00:38:46,675
Are you kidding?

587
00:38:48,206 --> 00:38:51,675
You could get out if you want to.
Become Boston's Caesar again.

588
00:38:52,685 --> 00:38:53,485
How?

589
00:38:54,685 --> 00:38:55,484
How?

590
00:38:57,204 --> 00:38:59,195
There's this Talent Contest...

591
00:39:00,204 --> 00:39:01,682
The winner goes to Helsinki.

592
00:39:02,203 --> 00:39:04,194
Boston's just a wink from there.

593
00:39:04,683 --> 00:39:07,674
- Is Helsinki the West?
- You have to try it.

594
00:39:08,202 --> 00:39:09,681
The age limit is thirty.

595
00:39:10,202 --> 00:39:11,191
But I'm...

596
00:39:12,681 --> 00:39:14,672
Maybe with a wig?

597
00:39:16,201 --> 00:39:18,192
That's it... A wig.

598
00:39:19,680 --> 00:39:20,669
And you?

599
00:39:21,680 --> 00:39:22,669
I am staying.

600
00:39:23,680 --> 00:39:25,192
I'm not going anywhere.

601
00:39:26,679 --> 00:39:29,193
But till then I'll be with you
if you want.

602
00:39:29,679 --> 00:39:30,667
I'll help you.

603
00:39:33,198 --> 00:39:35,665
Come on, I'll take the chains off.

604
00:39:36,197 --> 00:39:37,676
What categories are there?

605
00:39:39,197 --> 00:39:41,664
We wouldn't mind going
beyond the Lajta...

606
00:39:42,196 --> 00:39:44,664
My wife is fed up with Sopot.

607
00:39:45,676 --> 00:39:49,668
Sopot or Sochi every year
with IBUSZ.

608
00:40:23,309 --> 00:40:25,300
Turn that dreadful row off!

609
00:40:26,309 --> 00:40:30,301
You can't listen to
Radio Free Europe here.

610
00:40:30,828 --> 00:40:34,297
It's not Free Europe... It's
Luxembourg, and that's allowed.

611
00:40:35,307 --> 00:40:36,407
But not in my house.

612
00:40:39,826 --> 00:40:41,817
Turn it off now!

613
00:40:44,305 --> 00:40:45,294
Turn it off!

614
00:40:48,305 --> 00:40:49,818
I'm giving you your notice.

615
00:40:50,824 --> 00:40:52,144
You're out on the first.

616
00:40:52,824 --> 00:40:53,924
But that's tomorrow.

617
00:40:54,824 --> 00:40:55,812
Thank God!

618
00:40:59,303 --> 00:41:00,292
Dear Katinka...

619
00:41:01,302 --> 00:41:03,293
Things are going fine.

620
00:41:04,302 --> 00:41:05,815
I miss you very much.

621
00:41:06,822 --> 00:41:11,292
I can feel that air which I can't
write about but is to do with you.

622
00:41:12,301 --> 00:41:15,815
This is my 100th unsent letter. Why
don't you send me your address?

623
00:41:16,820 --> 00:41:19,287
Hugs, kisses, I adore you...

624
00:41:56,693 --> 00:41:59,684
I need someone too,

625
00:42:00,212 --> 00:42:02,203
Who is only mine

626
00:42:03,692 --> 00:42:07,206
Who'll be my partner all life long.

627
00:42:10,210 --> 00:42:12,678
Who'll do anything for me.

628
00:42:13,210 --> 00:42:15,677
And wherever he looks

629
00:42:16,689 --> 00:42:22,206
He'll only see me
everytime and everywhere.

630
00:42:23,208 --> 00:42:26,200
I need someone too

631
00:42:26,688 --> 00:42:29,201
Who'll stand by me,

632
00:42:30,207 --> 00:42:34,677
Who is mine
in good and bad times.

633
00:42:36,686 --> 00:42:42,203
Whose every secret thought

634
00:42:43,205 --> 00:42:47,197
I can sense by looking in his eyes.

635
00:42:49,684 --> 00:42:52,197
Someone like me

636
00:42:53,203 --> 00:42:55,671
Who has lived alone for a long time

637
00:42:56,682 --> 00:43:01,675
Who always travelled a lonely road

638
00:43:03,201 --> 00:43:08,194
Someone like me who's been

639
00:43:09,680 --> 00:43:14,673
constantly waiting for a mate
all his life.

640
00:43:15,679 --> 00:43:18,193
I need someone too

641
00:43:19,678 --> 00:43:22,192
who is meant for me

642
00:43:22,678 --> 00:43:27,193
Who's been sent by fate

643
00:43:29,197 --> 00:43:31,664
And if he exists

644
00:43:32,676 --> 00:43:34,667
I will search for him

645
00:43:35,676 --> 00:43:40,191
Till I find the way to his heart

646
00:44:18,668 --> 00:44:20,659
We gotta start rehearsing, guys.

647
00:44:21,667 --> 00:44:24,032
- Otherwise we'll never make it.
- Where to?

648
00:44:24,187 --> 00:44:27,037
- Kisses to you, Margit...
- Keep up the formalities.

649
00:44:27,186 --> 00:44:29,177
- Which category?
- Pop group.

650
00:44:31,666 --> 00:44:34,657
That's okay. The strong man act
is booked. What's the name?

651
00:44:35,185 --> 00:44:37,176
Felix and the Three Tangles

652
00:44:37,665 --> 00:44:40,178
- We haven't got one yet.
- Really, why not?

653
00:44:40,664 --> 00:44:43,414
Let's be the Defense Alliance...
They'd sponsor us.

654
00:44:43,664 --> 00:44:47,656
- Something constructive. - Comet.
- Felix and the Buddies.

655
00:44:48,183 --> 00:44:50,173
Why must it be Felix and the...?

656
00:44:51,182 --> 00:44:53,512
Cliff Richard and the Shadows.
That's what's cool.

657
00:44:53,662 --> 00:44:54,927
But it was all my idea.

658
00:44:55,542 --> 00:44:57,532
So what?
Anyone can be a leader.

659
00:44:58,661 --> 00:44:59,650
Me, for example.

660
00:45:01,181 --> 00:45:02,659
Are you rehearsing?

661
00:45:03,660 --> 00:45:05,173
Course we are.

662
00:45:06,180 --> 00:45:07,509
Trying to agree on a name.

663
00:45:07,659 --> 00:45:09,650
Don't you need a vocal?

664
00:45:10,179 --> 00:45:12,170
Yes, join the group.

665
00:45:13,178 --> 00:45:15,646
Olga and I want
to show you something.

666
00:45:16,178 --> 00:45:18,169
You guys need a vocal.
Come on.

667
00:45:21,417 --> 00:45:23,931
If he had half of what he doesn't

668
00:45:24,416 --> 00:45:27,408
To me half his heart is a treasure

669
00:45:27,936 --> 00:45:31,405
If he cared half as much about
our future as me

670
00:45:31,935 --> 00:45:34,403
I swear I'd forget my problems.

671
00:45:34,935 --> 00:45:37,402
If he had half of what I need

672
00:45:38,414 --> 00:45:40,928
The rest would come naturally

673
00:45:41,933 --> 00:45:44,401
If he only loved me
with his whole heart

674
00:45:44,933 --> 00:45:48,402
I'd have everything I needed.

675
00:45:49,412 --> 00:45:50,401
Etelka!

676
00:45:51,932 --> 00:45:53,922
You were choreographed!

677
00:45:55,411 --> 00:45:56,400
Well, yes...

678
00:45:57,931 --> 00:45:58,919
Who was it?

679
00:45:59,410 --> 00:46:02,260
- We don't even have a guitar.
- The rhythm is more important.

680
00:46:02,410 --> 00:46:04,609
- The bass.
- First we have to get drums.

681
00:46:04,929 --> 00:46:07,397
That's the most expensive.
Solo guitar is cheaper.

682
00:46:07,929 --> 00:46:09,408
Are you looking for me?

683
00:46:09,929 --> 00:46:12,396
- Why would we be?
- You got a problem, right?

684
00:46:13,928 --> 00:46:16,395
I've come to you from
the Screw Factory

685
00:46:17,407 --> 00:46:20,922
to fix the Trade Union
patronage.

686
00:46:50,361 --> 00:46:51,161
Attila!

687
00:46:51,881 --> 00:46:54,349
This letter was in the mailbox.

688
00:46:56,880 --> 00:46:57,869
What is it?

689
00:46:58,360 --> 00:46:59,873
Where did it come from?

690
00:47:00,880 --> 00:47:01,679
What?

691
00:47:01,879 --> 00:47:02,868
Canada?

692
00:47:05,359 --> 00:47:07,872
Katinka, so you wrote
after four years?

693
00:47:10,358 --> 00:47:11,871
Hey, it's been opened.

694
00:47:12,878 --> 00:47:14,356
What do you expect.

695
00:47:17,357 --> 00:47:19,870
Dear Attila... I'm writing
after many years,

696
00:47:20,876 --> 00:47:23,344
in the hope
you've not forgotten me.

697
00:47:23,876 --> 00:47:25,866
I've heard about
the Talent Contest,

698
00:47:26,875 --> 00:47:29,867
and that if you win
you'll be able to go to Helsinki.

699
00:47:30,874 --> 00:47:33,342
I hope to hug you soon
and marvel at the ocean

700
00:47:34,354 --> 00:47:37,763
drinking a Pepsi-Coca-Cola and
enjoying La Dolce Vita together.

701
00:47:38,873 --> 00:47:41,341
It's incredible.
She sensed I was coming.

702
00:47:42,352 --> 00:47:45,867
Drinking Pepsi-Coca-Cola...
Marvelling at the ocean...

703
00:47:46,352 --> 00:47:49,866
Dolce Vita, my Katinka...

704
00:47:51,351 --> 00:47:52,151
Hi, Attila.

705
00:47:54,350 --> 00:47:55,150
What's up?

706
00:47:55,870 --> 00:47:59,339
My landlady threw me out,
but I got a letter from Katinka.

707
00:47:59,869 --> 00:48:00,858
Aren't you hungry?

708
00:48:01,869 --> 00:48:04,860
Let's have some potato salad
at Marx Square.

709
00:48:05,348 --> 00:48:06,337
In the bistro?

710
00:48:07,908 --> 00:48:12,901
It's hard writing letters
when you can't say what you want.

711
00:48:13,907 --> 00:48:15,898
You have to remember
that some official

712
00:48:16,426 --> 00:48:18,417
is drooling over
your loving words.

713
00:48:18,906 --> 00:48:20,721
Don't write stuff like that then.

714
00:48:20,906 --> 00:48:22,418
She's waiting in Helsinki.

715
00:48:22,905 --> 00:48:25,419
I already know
how much the ticket costs.

716
00:48:26,425 --> 00:48:27,413
Great!

717
00:48:27,904 --> 00:48:30,418
She'll write the exact time
later.

718
00:48:31,424 --> 00:48:32,413
Provided we win...

719
00:48:32,904 --> 00:48:34,894
Where's she gonna send the letter?

720
00:48:35,423 --> 00:48:37,414
Where're you gonna sleep tonight?

721
00:48:38,423 --> 00:48:39,901
It's warm, maybe at the lake.

722
00:48:41,422 --> 00:48:45,414
Stay with us... There's a shed
at the end of the garden.

723
00:48:45,901 --> 00:48:47,111
It's even got a couch.

724
00:48:48,421 --> 00:48:51,890
I'd gladly go to that shed

725
00:48:52,420 --> 00:48:55,412
if the couch is not comfortable
for Attila.

726
00:48:56,419 --> 00:48:59,889
He could have my modest
rented room

727
00:49:00,899 --> 00:49:02,889
with restricted use of kitchen.

728
00:49:05,418 --> 00:49:08,887
How did you know we were here?
Did you follow me again?

729
00:49:09,897 --> 00:49:12,889
For once you followed me.

730
00:49:14,416 --> 00:49:16,407
I always eat here.

731
00:49:16,896 --> 00:49:19,409
This is the Lonely Hearts Bistro.

732
00:49:19,895 --> 00:49:21,408
Look around,

733
00:49:23,415 --> 00:49:24,893
you're the only couple here.

734
00:49:53,289 --> 00:49:56,759
Maybe no one understands me

735
00:49:57,289 --> 00:49:58,768
At least you should love me.

736
00:49:59,768 --> 00:50:00,868
Whatever's going on?

737
00:50:01,768 --> 00:50:04,463
It's the potato dumpling waltz.
Everyone joins in.

738
00:50:04,767 --> 00:50:09,137
I get lonely at night

739
00:50:09,287 --> 00:50:12,278
At least you should love me.

740
00:50:16,285 --> 00:50:18,753
Who needs a thorny,

741
00:50:19,285 --> 00:50:21,753
Funny person

742
00:50:22,764 --> 00:50:24,277
Who hides his heart

743
00:50:25,284 --> 00:50:27,275
And charming smile?

744
00:50:28,283 --> 00:50:29,762
What'll happen to me?

745
00:50:30,763 --> 00:50:32,276
The world is so big,

746
00:50:33,762 --> 00:50:38,278
Let's get together,
at least you should love me.

747
00:50:57,118 --> 00:50:59,586
Who needs a thorny,

748
00:51:00,118 --> 00:51:02,108
Funny person

749
00:51:03,117 --> 00:51:05,108
Who hides his heart

750
00:51:06,117 --> 00:51:08,107
And charming smile?

751
00:51:08,596 --> 00:51:10,587
What'll happen to me?

752
00:51:11,596 --> 00:51:13,586
The world is so big,

753
00:51:14,595 --> 00:51:19,110
Let's get together,
at least you should love me,

754
00:51:20,114 --> 00:51:25,585
Let's get together,
at least you should love me.

755
00:51:54,308 --> 00:51:56,822
I bought it for forty
at the market.

756
00:51:57,308 --> 00:51:58,297
Was it worth it?

757
00:52:00,827 --> 00:52:02,306
Have you got a record player?

758
00:52:03,307 --> 00:52:05,820
- I can't listen to it anywhere.
- At your dad's?

759
00:52:06,306 --> 00:52:08,297
Mary Lou at my dad's?

760
00:52:38,901 --> 00:52:40,379
Shu-shu madness

761
00:52:41,380 --> 00:52:44,372
The danger is here.

762
00:52:45,899 --> 00:52:47,890
Shu-shu heaven

763
00:52:48,899 --> 00:52:51,890
Oh, that's love.

764
00:52:53,378 --> 00:52:55,892
I just cry and sniffle a lot,

765
00:52:56,377 --> 00:52:59,892
My tears shine alone and lonely.

766
00:53:00,377 --> 00:53:02,367
I start laughing as soon as I hear

767
00:53:03,376 --> 00:53:04,889
Your footsteps on the stair,

768
00:53:05,896 --> 00:53:08,887
The lock rattles, music flies.

769
00:53:09,895 --> 00:53:11,886
It is full of disappointment

770
00:53:12,895 --> 00:53:15,362
Oh, that's love.

771
00:53:16,894 --> 00:53:22,889
There is no other solution
to my heart.

772
00:53:24,373 --> 00:53:26,886
I beg you, hurry to love me,

773
00:53:27,892 --> 00:53:29,883
Together they smile at us.

774
00:53:31,891 --> 00:53:35,884
Shu-shu madness
and shu-shu heaven.

775
00:53:40,370 --> 00:53:42,360
- What are you doing?
- Tap-dancing.

776
00:53:42,889 --> 00:53:44,368
Did you quit the band?

777
00:53:45,369 --> 00:53:47,360
I run in two classes.

778
00:53:49,368 --> 00:53:52,393
- What are you shaking yourself for?
- He's tap-dancing.

779
00:53:52,888 --> 00:53:53,876
What?

780
00:53:54,887 --> 00:53:55,687
Stop!

781
00:53:57,367 --> 00:53:58,356
Would you stop?

782
00:53:58,887 --> 00:54:00,736
- Why? Is it forbidden?
- Yes, it is.

783
00:54:00,886 --> 00:54:03,878
What you're doing
doesn't resemble tap-dancing.

784
00:54:04,885 --> 00:54:07,353
You shake your leg
like a man who's been hung.

785
00:54:07,885 --> 00:54:11,354
And this whining shu-shu
and doobie-doobie...

786
00:54:11,884 --> 00:54:13,363
You can't tap-dance to that.

787
00:54:14,364 --> 00:54:17,355
I'll show you what I mean.
Give me that walking stick.

788
00:54:19,363 --> 00:54:22,354
Take a walking-stick and be jolly,

789
00:54:22,882 --> 00:54:25,874
Tie a bow form your tie, buddy.

790
00:54:26,362 --> 00:54:29,876
And if your vest is checkered too,
your heart will beat

791
00:54:30,881 --> 00:54:33,349
To the irregular rhythm
of Dixieland.

792
00:54:34,880 --> 00:54:37,348
Ask your grandpa
for lacquered shoes,

793
00:54:38,360 --> 00:54:41,351
Steal out-grown clothes
from grandma,

794
00:54:42,359 --> 00:54:44,872
And get ready to go.
Dance the Charleston

795
00:54:45,358 --> 00:54:47,872
To old jazz
as that is hip today.

796
00:54:49,798 --> 00:54:50,597
Dance!

797
00:54:56,197 --> 00:54:58,891
You should be going
to the Talent Contest, dammit.

798
00:54:59,196 --> 00:55:00,709
He's just like Fred Astaire.

799
00:55:01,196 --> 00:55:03,186
That's cool, Dad...

800
00:55:05,195 --> 00:55:07,186
That's what it's about.

801
00:55:08,194 --> 00:55:10,185
The finals will be broadcast on TV.

802
00:55:11,194 --> 00:55:13,185
We must play
"The moon is trembling..."

803
00:55:13,713 --> 00:55:16,958
- Leave me alone with your moon.
- What about "Dolly-Birds"?

804
00:55:17,193 --> 00:55:17,993
That's it!

805
00:55:19,192 --> 00:55:20,181
Would you stop?

806
00:55:20,712 --> 00:55:23,180
Stop? It's you who should start.

807
00:55:25,191 --> 00:55:26,180
I'm off.

808
00:55:26,711 --> 00:55:29,703
You'll find me under the bed
at Etelka's.

809
00:55:48,467 --> 00:55:49,456
Good morning,

810
00:55:50,707 --> 00:55:53,698
I've come for my suitcase.

811
00:55:54,706 --> 00:55:57,181
- By all means.
- You didn't even go to sleep?

812
00:55:57,706 --> 00:55:59,185
I had to watch last night.

813
00:55:59,705 --> 00:56:02,173
Why are you always star-gazing?

814
00:56:02,705 --> 00:56:05,696
They'll stay there
without you guarding them.

815
00:56:06,704 --> 00:56:08,695
What's up?
Are you going away?

816
00:56:10,703 --> 00:56:11,692
Gosh, Mr. Bajkon,

817
00:56:14,183 --> 00:56:15,283
the world is so big.

818
00:56:17,182 --> 00:56:19,173
I went to the movies yesterday.

819
00:56:19,702 --> 00:56:21,693
Did you see something good?

820
00:56:22,181 --> 00:56:25,173
Not good, sweet.

821
00:56:26,181 --> 00:56:27,694
La Dolce Vita.

822
00:56:29,700 --> 00:56:31,179
I've made a decision.

823
00:56:31,700 --> 00:56:35,169
I want to live like the people
in the movie.

824
00:56:35,699 --> 00:56:37,178
Are you defecting?

825
00:56:37,699 --> 00:56:40,166
The hats and dresses they wore!

826
00:56:40,698 --> 00:56:44,691
And there was a gorgeous
Swedish woman.

827
00:56:45,697 --> 00:56:48,689
She walked barefoot
into a fountain.

828
00:56:49,697 --> 00:56:50,906
We'd be shot for that.

829
00:56:51,696 --> 00:56:54,164
Will Angela go with you?

830
00:56:56,176 --> 00:56:57,688
You can relax, she's staying.

831
00:56:58,695 --> 00:57:01,687
What's my future here?
Husband, kids, getting fat.

832
00:57:02,694 --> 00:57:07,165
I want people to throw flowers
at me,

833
00:57:07,694 --> 00:57:09,684
photograph me, stare at me,

834
00:57:10,173 --> 00:57:11,686
spoil and adore me.

835
00:57:12,693 --> 00:57:14,171
Have you got a passport?

836
00:57:17,692 --> 00:57:19,171
I'm going... Goodbye.

837
00:57:22,691 --> 00:57:27,161
Tell the landlord he can fill
the hole in the bathroom door.

838
00:57:28,170 --> 00:57:29,683
I may not tell him,

839
00:57:30,170 --> 00:57:32,160
you may come back, Manci...

840
00:57:32,689 --> 00:57:34,680
Here? Never!

841
00:57:36,688 --> 00:57:38,538
Thirty-one

842
00:57:38,688 --> 00:57:42,157
Thirty-two

843
00:57:45,167 --> 00:57:47,158
What is it?
Carry on, Boston's Caesar.

844
00:57:47,687 --> 00:57:49,165
Up!

845
00:57:49,686 --> 00:57:51,677
It's you who wants
to get out of here.

846
00:57:53,166 --> 00:57:54,154
Come on! One-two.

847
00:57:55,165 --> 00:57:56,154
What is it?

848
00:58:00,164 --> 00:58:02,155
I'm alright, come in boxer,

849
00:58:03,684 --> 00:58:04,839
I'll smash your face.

850
00:58:08,683 --> 00:58:10,162
Dear Margit, I'm sorry.

851
00:58:13,162 --> 00:58:14,151
Rough bastard.

852
00:58:15,162 --> 00:58:17,675
I dreamt I was being counted out.

853
00:58:18,681 --> 00:58:20,672
Forgive me.
Never again...

854
00:58:21,681 --> 00:58:22,669
Have a sip.

855
00:58:23,160 --> 00:58:25,151
Alright...
I got bigger ones before.

856
00:58:26,160 --> 00:58:27,149
Hardly felt it.

857
00:58:29,159 --> 00:58:30,672
Now run fifty laps.

858
00:58:31,679 --> 00:58:33,158
Only fifty?

859
00:58:33,678 --> 00:58:35,669
Right away. I'm going.

860
00:59:00,674 --> 00:59:02,104
What're you going to play?

861
00:59:02,673 --> 00:59:05,478
"The moon's trembling".
Don't know about the others.

862
00:59:05,673 --> 00:59:06,662
What's the matter?

863
00:59:08,192 --> 00:59:10,660
I don't have my drumsticks.
We're finished.

864
00:59:14,191 --> 00:59:16,659
I'm the host,
you're the bandleader.

865
00:59:17,191 --> 00:59:19,182
- Right?
- What is it?

866
00:59:20,190 --> 00:59:21,179
What's your name?

867
00:59:22,190 --> 00:59:25,181
It's not decided yet.
Know a good one?

868
00:59:25,669 --> 00:59:27,660
The Screw. That's our name.

869
00:59:28,189 --> 00:59:29,178
Our name?

870
00:59:30,189 --> 00:59:32,179
The Screw Factory's our sponsor.

871
00:59:32,668 --> 00:59:33,657
Screw...

872
00:59:34,668 --> 00:59:37,181
I'd rather suggest Scoundrels...

873
00:59:39,667 --> 00:59:41,180
And what number will you play?

874
00:59:42,187 --> 00:59:43,665
Last week's lottery numbers.

875
00:59:45,666 --> 00:59:50,181
Arrogance will get you nowhere.

876
00:59:50,665 --> 00:59:51,654
You don't say!

877
00:59:53,665 --> 00:59:55,424
You're on after the Power Plant.

878
00:59:59,184 --> 01:00:00,503
Well... thanks very much.

879
01:00:00,663 --> 01:00:02,478
Stay put, you're not in the jury.

880
01:00:11,061 --> 01:00:13,529
- Don't say you like this wailing.
- Calm down.

881
01:00:23,099 --> 01:00:24,088
Well, okay.

882
01:00:24,619 --> 01:00:27,087
Think I look under thirty?

883
01:00:29,618 --> 01:00:30,607
From afar.

884
01:00:31,098 --> 01:00:32,087
How far?

885
01:00:32,618 --> 01:00:33,607
Wait...

886
01:00:36,617 --> 01:00:38,096
From here you look forty.

887
01:00:40,616 --> 01:00:41,605
From there?

888
01:00:43,096 --> 01:00:44,966
Forty-five, wait, I'll go further.

889
01:00:53,094 --> 01:00:54,607
That's fantastic.

890
01:00:55,614 --> 01:00:57,092
What?
I don't understand.

891
01:00:58,093 --> 01:01:00,607
From here you're like
a factory apprentice.

892
01:01:02,612 --> 01:01:04,262
This isn't a football stadium.

893
01:01:04,612 --> 01:01:06,091
Why are you yelling?

894
01:01:15,970 --> 01:01:16,770
What?

895
01:01:17,450 --> 01:01:18,963
Bravo!

896
01:01:20,449 --> 01:01:22,484
We're waiting for
the jury's decision.

897
01:01:28,008 --> 01:01:30,476
The traditional Kodály
women's choir

898
01:01:31,007 --> 01:01:36,001
for their medley directly rooted
in Bartók,

899
01:01:36,487 --> 01:01:39,000
their persuasive sound

900
01:01:40,006 --> 01:01:41,997
and authentic folksiness.

901
01:01:42,485 --> 01:01:45,477
A real gem of folk art.

902
01:01:48,005 --> 01:01:49,434
They go to the next round.

903
01:01:52,484 --> 01:01:55,475
And now in the dincy-dancy class,

904
01:01:56,003 --> 01:01:58,471
we have the pretty Echo vocals.

905
01:02:05,002 --> 01:02:09,472
I've known Daddy Kis
and his son Pisti for years,

906
01:02:10,001 --> 01:02:11,479
So I must tell you that

907
01:02:12,480 --> 01:02:15,330
When Pisti was a little boy
he got plenty of attention,

908
01:02:15,480 --> 01:02:17,679
And was scolded sometimes, too:
Hey, you!

909
01:02:18,479 --> 01:02:20,993
And told he was a scapegrace,

910
01:02:21,999 --> 01:02:24,466
Who drags his Mom and Dad
by the hand,

911
01:02:25,478 --> 01:02:29,993
Who brags all day that he's got

912
01:02:30,997 --> 01:02:32,476
the very best sling-shot.

913
01:02:34,476 --> 01:02:35,989
You'd be good,

914
01:02:36,476 --> 01:02:39,468
says Dad, if you ate nice food,

915
01:02:39,995 --> 01:02:41,986
But he said no more,

916
01:02:42,995 --> 01:02:45,986
Just told him: never be a bore.

917
01:02:48,994 --> 01:02:52,986
Pisti grew up,
his amazing hair grew too,

918
01:02:53,473 --> 01:02:54,986
But that was no shame.

919
01:02:56,473 --> 01:02:59,464
He was rude to the girls
and who knows what else,

920
01:02:59,992 --> 01:03:01,983
Yet at home no one told him:
watch it!

921
01:03:04,471 --> 01:03:06,985
For them he was still
a little scapegrace,

922
01:03:07,991 --> 01:03:10,982
Though he was big now,
didn't drag them around.

923
01:03:11,470 --> 01:03:15,462
But it's money he needs now

924
01:03:15,989 --> 01:03:17,980
Not a sling-shot.

925
01:03:20,468 --> 01:03:21,981
It'd be good

926
01:03:22,988 --> 01:03:25,455
if his father were stricter,

927
01:03:25,987 --> 01:03:28,455
Then we could hope

928
01:03:28,987 --> 01:03:31,454
That his son would be better.

929
01:03:33,466 --> 01:03:34,979
Don't quit, girls. Go on.

930
01:03:35,986 --> 01:03:36,974
Go on! Do it!

931
01:03:41,905 --> 01:03:42,893
Great! More!

932
01:03:49,663 --> 01:03:52,655
Though my soul is gentle
and I don't preach

933
01:03:53,143 --> 01:03:55,656
I tell him if he acts bad with me

934
01:03:58,142 --> 01:04:00,341
I make sure there's no trouble
with Pisti

935
01:04:01,141 --> 01:04:03,132
I keep telling him:
watch it, kiddie!

936
01:04:05,141 --> 01:04:08,132
I promise he won't be
a scapegrace again

937
01:04:08,660 --> 01:04:11,651
At most he will beg for a kiss

938
01:04:12,659 --> 01:04:15,651
And drag me by the hand
to the old island

939
01:04:16,659 --> 01:04:19,126
And never again want a sling-shot.

940
01:04:23,137 --> 01:04:24,126
Jury! Stop it!

941
01:04:24,657 --> 01:04:26,648
Depraved. You're right, stop it.

942
01:04:27,137 --> 01:04:28,126
This is an orgy.

943
01:04:29,656 --> 01:04:32,648
They are men. I see that!

944
01:04:34,135 --> 01:04:35,124
Where's the host?

945
01:04:36,655 --> 01:04:38,360
- Scandal!
- Excuse me ladies...

946
01:04:39,654 --> 01:04:42,122
Stop playback music.

947
01:04:43,654 --> 01:04:45,644
- What happened?
- Echo vocals,

948
01:04:47,133 --> 01:04:49,124
are you men or women?

949
01:04:50,133 --> 01:04:52,123
- We protest. - What?
- The insinuation.

950
01:04:53,132 --> 01:04:55,123
That you are a man or a woman?

951
01:04:55,652 --> 01:04:57,642
- Both.
- We are contestants.

952
01:04:58,651 --> 01:05:00,981
Nothing was said about
sexual discrimination.

953
01:05:01,131 --> 01:05:02,120
Ugly jury!

954
01:05:03,650 --> 01:05:06,118
You are permanent, pornographic
scandal causers.

955
01:05:07,130 --> 01:05:09,643
Don't interfere
with the program.

956
01:05:11,129 --> 01:05:13,643
You call this provocation
a program?

957
01:05:14,128 --> 01:05:15,998
We got into the next round, right?

958
01:05:16,648 --> 01:05:19,068
It's not nice hanging around
in just panties.

959
01:05:19,648 --> 01:05:22,115
Ever tried balancing so long
in high-heels?

960
01:05:22,647 --> 01:05:27,117
The Echo Vocals fall outside
the realm of the WYC.

961
01:05:30,126 --> 01:05:31,638
- Cover up.
- Politics.

962
01:05:32,645 --> 01:05:34,350
- Chickenshit.
- Come on, girls.

963
01:05:35,125 --> 01:05:37,115
And the show goes on.

964
01:05:37,644 --> 01:05:39,123
Next comes Caesar,

965
01:05:40,124 --> 01:05:42,637
the strong man,
miscellaneous class.

966
01:05:50,122 --> 01:05:51,332
Don't go to the front.

967
01:05:52,122 --> 01:05:53,111
Stay behind.

968
01:05:53,642 --> 01:05:55,120
They'll notice the wig.

969
01:05:55,641 --> 01:05:56,630
The mike...

970
01:05:57,121 --> 01:05:58,634
I must announce...

971
01:05:59,641 --> 01:06:01,119
Esteemed audience...

972
01:06:02,120 --> 01:06:06,635
You can see this chain
made of Swedish steel.

973
01:06:08,639 --> 01:06:12,631
Boston's Caesar will tear it
apart with his chest.

974
01:06:18,117 --> 01:06:19,630
You're just my aid.

975
01:06:20,637 --> 01:06:23,104
I should have announced it.

976
01:06:24,636 --> 01:06:25,436
Selfish.

977
01:06:26,116 --> 01:06:27,629
You begrudge me the limelight?

978
01:06:28,635 --> 01:06:30,114
This isn't a singer's number.

979
01:06:30,635 --> 01:06:31,624
Keep in your place.

980
01:06:37,114 --> 01:06:38,103
Your wig is lovely.

981
01:06:41,113 --> 01:06:42,626
Not on my arms!

982
01:06:44,633 --> 01:06:46,111
What are you doing?

983
01:06:47,112 --> 01:06:48,101
You'll regret it.

984
01:06:49,632 --> 01:06:51,111
Now free yourself, Boston.

985
01:06:55,111 --> 01:06:56,624
It was my idea, dammit.

986
01:07:04,629 --> 01:07:05,618
Stupid bitch!

987
01:07:13,588 --> 01:07:15,100
Fight those damn chains.

988
01:07:22,106 --> 01:07:23,585
At it, Hungarians!

989
01:07:46,622 --> 01:07:48,101
Long live Caesar!

990
01:07:58,100 --> 01:08:00,567
Let's hear the jury's decision.

991
01:08:01,099 --> 01:08:02,578
The chain got through.

992
01:08:03,099 --> 01:08:05,090
The contestant I'm afraid did not.

993
01:08:06,098 --> 01:08:07,087
Well, sorry...

994
01:08:08,098 --> 01:08:08,898
Thank you.

995
01:08:09,098 --> 01:08:10,087
Jerks!

996
01:08:12,577 --> 01:08:13,566
Rotten assholes.

997
01:08:15,097 --> 01:08:16,576
Get on stage quick.

998
01:08:17,096 --> 01:08:19,564
They need rock and roll.
That'll calm them.

999
01:08:20,576 --> 01:08:22,567
We haven't decided yet.

1000
01:08:23,095 --> 01:08:24,084
What?

1001
01:08:24,575 --> 01:08:26,566
What we're going to play.

1002
01:08:27,575 --> 01:08:30,566
Just get on stage and play.

1003
01:08:31,574 --> 01:08:32,563
With our dicks?

1004
01:08:35,093 --> 01:08:37,084
- Come on...
- He bowled me over.

1005
01:08:38,573 --> 01:08:39,728
I got you drumsticks.

1006
01:08:40,572 --> 01:08:42,563
But they're egg-beaters.

1007
01:08:43,092 --> 01:08:44,081
Drums or eggs...

1008
01:08:45,092 --> 01:08:47,559
Just beat them, dear Dodi,
I love you so.

1009
01:08:48,091 --> 01:08:50,082
If only girls would
just get lost.

1010
01:08:50,571 --> 01:08:52,083
Silence and order.

1011
01:08:52,570 --> 01:08:55,562
Let's calm down.
Let off steam. Right?

1012
01:08:56,090 --> 01:08:58,557
Do you want them to lose
all confidence in us?

1013
01:08:59,569 --> 01:09:02,561
Do you want the neighbouring
block to get through?

1014
01:09:03,088 --> 01:09:04,077
I'd be ashamed.

1015
01:09:05,088 --> 01:09:08,080
Isn't the spirit of the WYC
alive for you?

1016
01:09:09,087 --> 01:09:10,076
Well then!

1017
01:09:11,567 --> 01:09:12,556
Let's continue.

1018
01:09:13,567 --> 01:09:16,558
Finally the last number
in the qualifying round,

1019
01:09:17,086 --> 01:09:19,077
the dincy-dancy category.

1020
01:09:19,566 --> 01:09:24,081
A talented group
from the district by the name of

1021
01:09:25,085 --> 01:09:26,563
Screw.

1022
01:09:27,564 --> 01:09:30,078
What are we going to hear?

1023
01:09:31,563 --> 01:09:34,077
- "I saw her in a bikini."
- "The moon trembles..."

1024
01:09:34,563 --> 01:09:35,363
What?

1025
01:09:36,083 --> 01:09:38,073
Play that party rhythm one

1026
01:09:38,562 --> 01:09:40,075
or we'll go home.

1027
01:09:41,082 --> 01:09:43,549
- What?
- "Portable radio"? - Yes.

1028
01:09:44,081 --> 01:09:47,551
"Portable radio, rhythm party..."

1029
01:09:50,080 --> 01:09:51,559
Don't stand in front of me.

1030
01:09:56,759 --> 01:09:58,750
Come on, Screw Factory!

1031
01:10:04,878 --> 01:10:05,866
Portable radio,

1032
01:10:06,877 --> 01:10:08,356
I always listen to

1033
01:10:08,877 --> 01:10:11,868
How they play my song

1034
01:10:13,876 --> 01:10:16,344
This music I love, so much.

1035
01:10:20,875 --> 01:10:22,865
Portable radio

1036
01:10:23,354 --> 01:10:24,867
I listen all the time.

1037
01:10:25,354 --> 01:10:27,868
I need no silence

1038
01:10:30,353 --> 01:10:32,344
Come yell with me.

1039
01:10:33,353 --> 01:10:34,341
Beat it, Dodi!

1040
01:10:39,352 --> 01:10:40,864
Life's good in summer

1041
01:10:41,351 --> 01:10:43,342
I don't get a minute's rest

1042
01:10:44,351 --> 01:10:46,341
Cos I feel the need to dance

1043
01:10:46,870 --> 01:10:48,861
Portable radio

1044
01:10:49,350 --> 01:10:50,339
rhythm party,

1045
01:10:50,870 --> 01:10:54,339
Hey-ho, so intoxicating

1046
01:10:56,349 --> 01:10:58,862
Come yell along,
life's good in summer.

1047
01:11:13,826 --> 01:11:14,814
Katinka...

1048
01:11:17,865 --> 01:11:18,665
What happened?

1049
01:11:21,344 --> 01:11:22,144
Angela!

1050
01:11:24,824 --> 01:11:26,143
What are you doing here?

1051
01:11:26,823 --> 01:11:27,812
Don't you remember?

1052
01:11:29,583 --> 01:11:30,572
No.

1053
01:11:32,822 --> 01:11:33,622
Not a thing.

1054
01:11:35,822 --> 01:11:36,811
I got a headache.

1055
01:11:38,821 --> 01:11:40,141
What happened yesterday?

1056
01:11:40,821 --> 01:11:42,812
We celebrated that
you qualified...

1057
01:11:44,340 --> 01:11:45,140
And then?

1058
01:11:45,820 --> 01:11:46,620
Nothing.

1059
01:11:47,820 --> 01:11:49,332
We listened to the radio,

1060
01:11:49,819 --> 01:11:50,808
I got sleepy...

1061
01:11:52,339 --> 01:11:53,818
and now we're sleeping.

1062
01:11:54,338 --> 01:11:55,817
We got through?

1063
01:11:56,818 --> 01:11:58,331
I thought I dreamt it.

1064
01:12:03,337 --> 01:12:04,326
My father!

1065
01:12:08,816 --> 01:12:10,329
Good evening...

1066
01:12:17,334 --> 01:12:18,323
The thing is...

1067
01:12:20,334 --> 01:12:21,134
Angela,

1068
01:12:22,334 --> 01:12:28,329
love has caught up with you.

1069
01:12:30,332 --> 01:12:33,802
Angela, Angela,

1070
01:12:35,331 --> 01:12:38,801
I get dizzy all over

1071
01:12:40,810 --> 01:12:44,803
And the shadows turn into light

1072
01:12:45,809 --> 01:12:49,324
As I see you in my arms.

1073
01:12:51,329 --> 01:12:54,320
Angela,

1074
01:12:56,328 --> 01:12:59,797
My little angel.

1075
01:13:03,806 --> 01:13:04,795
What are you doing?

1076
01:13:06,806 --> 01:13:08,016
Who is this young man?

1077
01:13:08,805 --> 01:13:11,797
- Who are you?
- He's got no place to stay...

1078
01:13:12,805 --> 01:13:13,794
What's going on?

1079
01:13:14,804 --> 01:13:17,609
A girl's greatest asset
is her virginity these days.

1080
01:13:17,804 --> 01:13:20,004
And you're messing around
with a stranger

1081
01:13:20,803 --> 01:13:22,794
along with my mandrel
and my hand-drill.

1082
01:13:23,323 --> 01:13:25,790
What if the plane I got
from grandpa disappears?

1083
01:13:27,322 --> 01:13:28,801
- Greetings...
- Mom!

1084
01:14:21,873 --> 01:14:23,863
God, you've got cool parents.

1085
01:14:27,872 --> 01:14:30,863
I don't want to see you here
in ten minutes.

1086
01:14:35,870 --> 01:14:37,349
Give me a good coffee.

1087
01:14:40,349 --> 01:14:41,862
Give me something to drink.

1088
01:14:43,869 --> 01:14:45,354
What are you so glum about?

1089
01:14:45,868 --> 01:14:47,347
You're the talk of the block.

1090
01:14:47,868 --> 01:14:49,859
The egg-beaters.

1091
01:14:50,348 --> 01:14:52,861
The egg-beaters complicated
our qualifying.

1092
01:14:53,867 --> 01:14:54,856
I don't get it.

1093
01:14:55,347 --> 01:14:58,338
Felix says we qualified
because of the egg-beaters.

1094
01:14:58,866 --> 01:15:02,336
- They judged it as a comedy turn.
- See what you did?

1095
01:15:03,345 --> 01:15:05,336
Women overcomplicate things.

1096
01:15:06,345 --> 01:15:09,699
Don't be crazy... You're in the
finals and that's what counts.

1097
01:15:09,864 --> 01:15:12,332
Yes, we qualified
and we're going to Helsinki.

1098
01:15:13,864 --> 01:15:16,331
How'll we get there?
Plane? Train? Bus?

1099
01:15:17,343 --> 01:15:18,856
IBUSZ!

1100
01:15:19,863 --> 01:15:21,853
No, with a trolleybus.

1101
01:15:22,862 --> 01:15:24,853
You got a letter, Attila.

1102
01:15:25,862 --> 01:15:26,661
What?

1103
01:15:33,340 --> 01:15:34,853
Dear Attila!

1104
01:15:35,340 --> 01:15:37,853
I'm standing here
at Niagara Falls

1105
01:15:38,339 --> 01:15:40,330
watching the water falling

1106
01:15:40,859 --> 01:15:42,850
and imagining you here with me.

1107
01:15:43,858 --> 01:15:46,850
You're drinking Coca-Cola,
I have a Pepsi and we enjoy...

1108
01:15:47,858 --> 01:15:49,336
Katinka... I'm coming!

1109
01:15:50,857 --> 01:15:51,846
For sure.

1110
01:15:53,337 --> 01:15:54,326
You coming, Attila?

1111
01:15:55,856 --> 01:15:58,324
Too bad she doesn't speak
Hungarian. Look...

1112
01:15:58,856 --> 01:16:00,334
The other is Mastroianni.

1113
01:16:02,335 --> 01:16:04,849
- A pretzel, please.
- Who was that?

1114
01:16:05,335 --> 01:16:06,847
These people do live!

1115
01:16:07,334 --> 01:16:08,847
What a woman!

1116
01:16:09,334 --> 01:16:10,847
Just imagine!

1117
01:16:11,334 --> 01:16:13,324
And here we have
construction camps.

1118
01:16:13,853 --> 01:16:16,321
- And semolina noodles.
- And cheap black drawers.

1119
01:16:16,853 --> 01:16:18,331
She looks like Manci.

1120
01:16:20,332 --> 01:16:22,846
- Damn this life!
- Damn this Dolce Vita!

1121
01:16:24,851 --> 01:16:26,330
I don't want to rot here.

1122
01:16:26,851 --> 01:16:28,330
Hush! Rot someplace else.

1123
01:16:29,330 --> 01:16:30,130
Damn...

1124
01:16:31,330 --> 01:16:32,319
Pretzel, please.

1125
01:16:32,850 --> 01:16:35,317
Who was it? Don't mess with me.

1126
01:16:35,849 --> 01:16:39,842
I know you're all here
to watch that Swedish cow!

1127
01:16:41,328 --> 01:16:42,317
Pretzel. Quick.

1128
01:16:44,848 --> 01:16:46,662
Who was it?
I'll call a policeman.

1129
01:16:47,327 --> 01:16:48,316
Aren't you one?

1130
01:16:50,327 --> 01:16:51,839
Dolce Vita...

1131
01:16:52,326 --> 01:16:53,315
Dodi...

1132
01:17:06,324 --> 01:17:09,838
- Anita, come here or I'll come
to you. - That's right, let's go.

1133
01:17:11,323 --> 01:17:12,836
We'll stop the screening.

1134
01:17:13,323 --> 01:17:14,835
Quick. They'll stop it.

1135
01:17:19,842 --> 01:17:20,941
Anita, I'm coming...

1136
01:17:24,841 --> 01:17:25,830
What a riot!

1137
01:17:27,840 --> 01:17:30,308
We have to play at the finals.
Don't get caught.

1138
01:17:30,840 --> 01:17:32,318
We can't miss this!

1139
01:17:35,839 --> 01:17:37,829
Shu-shu madness,

1140
01:17:38,838 --> 01:17:40,317
the danger is here.

1141
01:18:45,347 --> 01:18:46,859
What's going on here?

1142
01:18:47,346 --> 01:18:48,859
Don't you recognize me?

1143
01:18:50,346 --> 01:18:53,860
Why are you here
at this hour, Jenõ?

1144
01:18:54,345 --> 01:18:55,334
That's him.

1145
01:18:56,345 --> 01:18:57,334
Jenõ, is that you?

1146
01:18:58,864 --> 01:18:59,853
Let me see you.

1147
01:19:00,864 --> 01:19:02,343
You don't remember me.

1148
01:19:03,343 --> 01:19:05,334
Give a kiss to your auntie.
Come on!

1149
01:19:05,863 --> 01:19:08,331
Didn't your father
tell you about me?

1150
01:19:09,342 --> 01:19:12,334
What are doing here?
It's midnight.

1151
01:19:12,862 --> 01:19:14,341
Did you break in?

1152
01:19:14,861 --> 01:19:16,340
We're rehearsing.

1153
01:19:17,341 --> 01:19:20,855
Preparing for the
Talent Contest.

1154
01:19:21,340 --> 01:19:22,329
Talent Contest?

1155
01:19:23,340 --> 01:19:24,329
I heard about it.

1156
01:19:24,860 --> 01:19:26,338
You're so cute.

1157
01:19:28,859 --> 01:19:30,014
Where's the restroom?

1158
01:19:30,339 --> 01:19:31,328
That way...

1159
01:19:31,858 --> 01:19:32,847
I'll be right back.

1160
01:19:33,858 --> 01:19:35,337
Don't start without me.

1161
01:19:39,857 --> 01:19:41,336
Is your auntie a cop?

1162
01:19:42,337 --> 01:19:44,850
Idiots, I don't even know
who she is.

1163
01:19:46,856 --> 01:19:48,847
How's it going?

1164
01:19:49,855 --> 01:19:52,323
We were at the movies.
Come on home now.

1165
01:19:52,855 --> 01:19:54,845
- Are you hungry?
- I want a banana.

1166
01:19:55,334 --> 01:19:57,325
You're not a monkey.

1167
01:19:57,854 --> 01:20:00,845
Hunger? I can tell
you were never on the stage.

1168
01:20:01,853 --> 01:20:04,163
An artist never feels hunger
in rehearsals.

1169
01:20:05,333 --> 01:20:06,652
What are you staring at?

1170
01:20:09,332 --> 01:20:12,323
Ernesztin, from Tömõ Street!
Is that you?

1171
01:20:12,851 --> 01:20:15,319
Aranka Varga,
the baker's daughter...

1172
01:20:16,331 --> 01:20:18,844
Where we went for ice-cream,
right, Simon?

1173
01:20:19,330 --> 01:20:22,845
Jenõ, go home. The rest go to
the barber. The rehearsal's over.

1174
01:20:26,849 --> 01:20:29,316
- Greetings!
- Goodnight.

1175
01:20:31,328 --> 01:20:34,133
What a coincidence that
you're on duty in this area.

1176
01:20:34,847 --> 01:20:37,315
Public safety throws me
here and there.

1177
01:20:37,847 --> 01:20:40,315
But I see you guard
the family nest.

1178
01:20:40,846 --> 01:20:42,837
Jenõ's in the Talent Contest.

1179
01:20:43,846 --> 01:20:46,313
We agreed that
she'd get out of your life

1180
01:20:46,845 --> 01:20:49,925
and I'd overlook your little
affair in return, whereas...

1181
01:20:50,325 --> 01:20:52,838
Surely we're not going to
make a drama out of this?

1182
01:20:53,324 --> 01:20:55,315
Let's get a shot of
coffee liqueur.

1183
01:20:56,324 --> 01:20:57,424
Béla, where are you?

1184
01:20:58,323 --> 01:20:59,836
Let's drink!

1185
01:21:00,843 --> 01:21:02,108
What movie did you see?

1186
01:21:02,843 --> 01:21:04,321
La Dolce Vita.

1187
01:21:06,322 --> 01:21:07,122
Dreadful.

1188
01:21:07,322 --> 01:21:11,314
Since it's been on
things have got out of routine.

1189
01:21:11,841 --> 01:21:15,310
The whole city's gone mad.
I'd ban it.

1190
01:21:16,320 --> 01:21:18,311
To our health then!

1191
01:21:20,839 --> 01:21:22,830
Wander through the night with me

1192
01:21:23,839 --> 01:21:25,830
Pest is worth an evening

1193
01:21:26,838 --> 01:21:28,829
Every window winks at us

1194
01:21:29,838 --> 01:21:31,829
Pest is worth an evening.

1195
01:21:32,837 --> 01:21:35,305
We walk Buda's cobbled streets

1196
01:21:35,837 --> 01:21:38,304
Beside the island, by the bridges

1197
01:21:39,316 --> 01:21:41,307
A hundred moonrays on the Danube

1198
01:21:42,316 --> 01:21:44,829
Starshine plus me.

1199
01:21:45,835 --> 01:21:47,826
And if this is not enough

1200
01:21:48,835 --> 01:21:50,313
It's just the beginning

1201
01:21:51,834 --> 01:21:53,825
You'll see after the first kiss

1202
01:21:54,833 --> 01:21:56,824
That Pest is worth an evening

1203
01:21:57,833 --> 01:22:00,824
Pest is worth an evening.

1204
01:22:18,789 --> 01:22:20,439
Did you bring the egg-beaters?

1205
01:22:22,269 --> 01:22:24,782
Are you nuts? I'm a drummer
not a pastry-cook.

1206
01:22:27,788 --> 01:22:29,602
Ede didn't bring the egg-beaters.

1207
01:22:30,267 --> 01:22:31,862
We can send someone for them.

1208
01:22:32,787 --> 01:22:34,437
You want to make a fool of me?

1209
01:22:34,787 --> 01:22:36,777
Not a fool, a winner.

1210
01:22:39,266 --> 01:22:40,778
Let me through...

1211
01:22:42,265 --> 01:22:43,254
Boys,

1212
01:22:44,265 --> 01:22:46,255
have you seen Margit from II/c?

1213
01:22:46,784 --> 01:22:47,884
They didn't qualify.

1214
01:22:48,784 --> 01:22:51,114
I don't need the guy in chains,
only the girl.

1215
01:22:51,264 --> 01:22:54,618
If you see her tell her to come
to the basement dressing room.

1216
01:22:58,262 --> 01:23:00,253
- Contestant?
- No, just audience.

1217
01:23:01,262 --> 01:23:02,857
My friend will recite a poem.

1218
01:23:03,262 --> 01:23:06,253
- Come with me to the basement.
- But I didn't do anything.

1219
01:23:06,781 --> 01:23:08,260
I can see that. Now you will.

1220
01:23:09,260 --> 01:23:11,251
It's in the block interest.
Come on.

1221
01:23:11,780 --> 01:23:13,771
Help! It's not the 1950s!

1222
01:23:14,260 --> 01:23:16,184
You're right, it's the 60s.
Come on.

1223
01:23:16,779 --> 01:23:18,629
- What about my friend?
- Go inside.

1224
01:23:18,779 --> 01:23:19,579
Dodi!

1225
01:23:20,778 --> 01:23:23,246
I couldn't sleep all night
I was so nervous.

1226
01:23:23,778 --> 01:23:26,769
I know, I was there too.
Don't you remember?

1227
01:23:28,777 --> 01:23:29,766
Hi, Attila.

1228
01:23:30,777 --> 01:23:34,246
We came to root for you,
though I prefer Bach.

1229
01:23:35,776 --> 01:23:37,414
I didn't know you were dating.

1230
01:23:37,895 --> 01:23:40,409
I didn't want him behind me
all the time.

1231
01:23:40,895 --> 01:23:43,409
- I have to talk to you.
- Angela...

1232
01:23:45,894 --> 01:23:46,694
What is it?

1233
01:23:47,894 --> 01:23:49,406
I must tell you something.

1234
01:23:50,413 --> 01:23:52,404
Who knows,
you might win the finals.

1235
01:23:53,413 --> 01:23:55,403
Might? We will.

1236
01:23:55,892 --> 01:23:58,884
If you do, then first I have
to admit

1237
01:23:59,892 --> 01:24:01,596
that I wrote Katinka's letters.

1238
01:24:02,411 --> 01:24:03,890
What? Katinka's letters...

1239
01:24:04,891 --> 01:24:08,405
I wrote them all. Even the first
one four years ago.

1240
01:24:09,890 --> 01:24:11,403
You're making it up.

1241
01:24:12,889 --> 01:24:16,404
We drink Coca-Cola,
and the Niagara Falls...

1242
01:24:18,408 --> 01:24:19,397
What is all this?

1243
01:24:21,408 --> 01:24:22,397
Shu-shu madness.

1244
01:24:23,408 --> 01:24:24,396
Manci!

1245
01:24:26,407 --> 01:24:28,875
- You're an idiot.
- I'll defect anyway.

1246
01:24:32,406 --> 01:24:33,395
Manci's back.

1247
01:24:34,406 --> 01:24:35,205
How are you?

1248
01:24:35,885 --> 01:24:36,874
I'm at the TV.

1249
01:24:37,405 --> 01:24:40,874
I'm reserve announcer for the
Czech Experimental Program.

1250
01:24:41,404 --> 01:24:43,872
I'm on unpaid leave
so I came home.

1251
01:24:44,404 --> 01:24:45,393
Manci!

1252
01:24:45,884 --> 01:24:48,875
Could you put my suitcase
in the cloakroom?

1253
01:24:49,403 --> 01:24:50,392
I'd be happy to.

1254
01:24:52,882 --> 01:24:53,871
Dear Angela...

1255
01:24:55,882 --> 01:24:56,997
- Margit?
- What is it?

1256
01:24:57,522 --> 01:24:59,989
Uncle Simon is looking for you.

1257
01:25:02,521 --> 01:25:05,512
Margit! Thank God you're here.
Stand there.

1258
01:25:09,000 --> 01:25:09,799
Ladies!

1259
01:25:10,519 --> 01:25:12,987
One of the women's choir is sick.

1260
01:25:13,999 --> 01:25:16,512
They're sure winners
in their class

1261
01:25:16,998 --> 01:25:18,511
so they'd go to the WYC.

1262
01:25:19,998 --> 01:25:22,802
- What are you doing here?
- Me? I came with Margit.

1263
01:25:22,997 --> 01:25:24,510
You should be with your band.

1264
01:25:24,997 --> 01:25:27,988
Go on, tune, sing and
go to the barber. Get going!

1265
01:25:52,792 --> 01:25:55,259
Could you close it,
there's such a draught.

1266
01:25:56,791 --> 01:25:57,780
Which are you?

1267
01:25:58,791 --> 01:26:00,270
It said... on the door...

1268
01:26:01,270 --> 01:26:02,370
We're the pop group.

1269
01:26:03,270 --> 01:26:04,783
You're going to Helsinki, no?

1270
01:26:05,790 --> 01:26:09,259
Then you must be
from Bánki Dixieland.

1271
01:26:11,269 --> 01:26:12,257
Let's see.

1272
01:26:13,788 --> 01:26:15,267
What are these outfits?

1273
01:26:16,788 --> 01:26:18,266
They belong to the winners.

1274
01:26:18,787 --> 01:26:20,266
The Hungarian delegation.

1275
01:26:21,267 --> 01:26:24,258
But... the finals are
only just starting.

1276
01:26:25,266 --> 01:26:27,780
Don't annoy me... They took your
measurements...

1277
01:26:28,786 --> 01:26:31,253
and didn't tell you you're going
to Helsinki?

1278
01:26:32,265 --> 01:26:34,256
The girl who can wear these boots

1279
01:26:34,785 --> 01:26:36,263
will join the choir.

1280
01:26:37,264 --> 01:26:38,064
Let's start.

1281
01:26:47,262 --> 01:26:48,062
Push...

1282
01:26:52,261 --> 01:26:55,776
- Small... it won't fit.
- Push harder.

1283
01:26:56,261 --> 01:26:58,774
How can someone
have such pig feet?

1284
01:27:01,260 --> 01:27:03,251
I see it won't work.
Next please.

1285
01:27:11,778 --> 01:27:12,767
It's perfect.

1286
01:27:13,778 --> 01:27:15,256
Show me. Let me see.

1287
01:27:15,777 --> 01:27:16,766
They're too big!

1288
01:27:17,777 --> 01:27:21,461
- I'll stuff them with cotton wool.
- I'll tell you what to stuff...

1289
01:27:21,776 --> 01:27:22,576
Go on.

1290
01:27:23,776 --> 01:27:26,244
- Come on Margit.
- I don't want to.

1291
01:27:27,255 --> 01:27:28,355
Oh, come on, Margit.

1292
01:27:29,255 --> 01:27:32,246
Do you want to ruin me?
You can go to the West!

1293
01:27:32,774 --> 01:27:35,766
This is more than block interest.
Put them on!

1294
01:27:43,253 --> 01:27:44,241
We made it.

1295
01:27:51,771 --> 01:27:53,762
The rival group is starting now.

1296
01:27:54,251 --> 01:27:55,763
Then it's us.

1297
01:27:58,250 --> 01:28:00,241
We should discuss what to play.

1298
01:28:12,807 --> 01:28:14,798
Dolly-bird smile at me

1299
01:28:15,807 --> 01:28:17,798
Dolly-bird fall for me

1300
01:28:18,806 --> 01:28:20,797
You will be my sweet angel

1301
01:28:21,806 --> 01:28:24,273
Guardian angel in my life's heaven

1302
01:28:25,285 --> 01:28:27,276
Dolly-bird I spoil you

1303
01:28:28,285 --> 01:28:30,798
Dolly-bird do be mine

1304
01:28:31,804 --> 01:28:33,795
Please forgive me for I

1305
01:28:34,284 --> 01:28:36,797
Die to have a kiss from you.

1306
01:29:03,519 --> 01:29:06,032
Your colourful cotton dress

1307
01:29:06,518 --> 01:29:09,032
is all flowers

1308
01:29:10,037 --> 01:29:12,028
Your gentle voice is hard to resist

1309
01:29:13,037 --> 01:29:15,028
You're a Pest girl and that's it.

1310
01:29:52,950 --> 01:29:54,941
Damn!
They cheated me.

1311
01:30:08,587 --> 01:30:10,578
I like the colour of your eyes

1312
01:30:11,587 --> 01:30:14,054
But I still don't know your name

1313
01:30:15,066 --> 01:30:18,057
Dolly-bird I love you so
I call you so

1314
01:30:19,065 --> 01:30:24,058
Dolly-bird, please be mine!

1315
01:30:26,584 --> 01:30:28,784
- Let's not play "Dolly-bird".
- I agree.

1316
01:30:29,583 --> 01:30:32,051
We've agreed on what not to play.

1317
01:30:33,063 --> 01:30:34,576
Shall we go on stage at all?

1318
01:30:36,062 --> 01:30:37,051
Isn't that Margit?

1319
01:30:42,061 --> 01:30:43,574
What happened to you?

1320
01:30:44,581 --> 01:30:48,050
The black cherry is ripe

1321
01:30:49,060 --> 01:30:50,573
I take some to my love...

1322
01:30:55,579 --> 01:30:57,058
Come on... Go on!

1323
01:31:04,057 --> 01:31:06,048
Well we cooked that one.

1324
01:31:07,057 --> 01:31:10,048
Boys, you are next.

1325
01:31:13,576 --> 01:31:16,043
Is the group going to Helsinki?

1326
01:31:17,055 --> 01:31:18,568
How would I know that?

1327
01:31:19,055 --> 01:31:22,569
Anyone can win in this contest.

1328
01:31:24,054 --> 01:31:26,568
I wish I could be young again.

1329
01:31:27,573 --> 01:31:29,052
Anyone can win...

1330
01:31:30,053 --> 01:31:30,853
Yes...

1331
01:31:31,573 --> 01:31:33,563
But they don't leave it to chance.

1332
01:31:34,572 --> 01:31:37,564
It wasn't the world youth
you wanted to meet anyway.

1333
01:31:38,052 --> 01:31:40,042
there in Helsinki.

1334
01:31:41,051 --> 01:31:42,564
Fix your hair.
Want a comb?

1335
01:31:44,050 --> 01:31:46,564
- I've got one.
- Where is everyone?

1336
01:31:47,570 --> 01:31:51,039
The whole city is watching TV.
The finals of the Talent Contest.

1337
01:31:51,569 --> 01:31:52,369
Imbeciles.

1338
01:31:53,049 --> 01:31:55,562
For forty. Understand?

1339
01:31:56,048 --> 01:31:57,561
The cover was different.

1340
01:31:58,568 --> 01:32:00,559
Let's get out of here.

1341
01:32:03,567 --> 01:32:04,556
At long last.

1342
01:32:06,567 --> 01:32:07,366
Come on.

1343
01:32:07,566 --> 01:32:09,045
Got a cigarette?

1344
01:32:27,243 --> 01:32:28,232
So here you are!

1345
01:32:30,242 --> 01:32:32,233
- Miss?
- You womanizer...

1346
01:32:37,241 --> 01:32:38,230
Terike!

1347
01:32:42,240 --> 01:32:44,231
I've looked for you ever since.

1348
01:32:44,760 --> 01:32:48,229
- I've shaved my legs.
- Pity!

1349
01:32:48,759 --> 01:32:50,238
They were nice like that.

1350
01:32:51,239 --> 01:32:54,230
You see? Here is all my stuff.
I've left home.

1351
01:32:55,758 --> 01:32:59,227
Do you still have
what you showed me?

1352
01:32:59,757 --> 01:33:01,236
My treasured possession?

1353
01:33:02,237 --> 01:33:05,228
As you call it.
I figured out what it is.

1354
01:33:06,236 --> 01:33:08,227
That's quite something.

1355
01:33:14,755 --> 01:33:17,746
Stalin's index finger
from his demolished statue.

1356
01:33:19,754 --> 01:33:20,743
May I take it out?

1357
01:33:21,233 --> 01:33:24,225
Careful. It cost me five years.

1358
01:33:30,752 --> 01:33:33,743
I'll cook for you.
I can bake too.

1359
01:33:34,751 --> 01:33:37,743
I'm not a good prospect for you.

1360
01:33:38,230 --> 01:33:41,222
I threw things at Horthy as a kid,

1361
01:33:42,230 --> 01:33:43,743
then at Szálasi,

1362
01:33:45,229 --> 01:33:47,220
then I threw things at Rákosi

1363
01:33:48,229 --> 01:33:50,219
and now I'm planning Kádár...

1364
01:33:51,228 --> 01:33:52,217
I'll wait for you.

1365
01:33:53,228 --> 01:33:54,741
Even if they lock you up.

1366
01:34:09,905 --> 01:34:11,896
Just a moment.

1367
01:34:12,385 --> 01:34:13,373
What is it?

1368
01:34:15,384 --> 01:34:16,897
Couldn't we now?

1369
01:34:17,904 --> 01:34:18,703
What?

1370
01:34:19,383 --> 01:34:20,896
Like the old days... you know.

1371
01:34:21,903 --> 01:34:22,703
No.

1372
01:34:23,903 --> 01:34:25,381
Just a bit.

1373
01:34:25,902 --> 01:34:27,893
You're a grown man, aren't you?

1374
01:34:59,056 --> 01:35:02,048
I adore life, I adore life

1375
01:35:02,536 --> 01:35:06,050
I adore watching the stars
on a summer night

1376
01:35:10,054 --> 01:35:11,384
Life is grand

1377
01:35:11,534 --> 01:35:16,527
I love to give,
love to receive

1378
01:35:17,533 --> 01:35:20,525
I love to laugh happily
and obliviously

1379
01:35:24,532 --> 01:35:26,045
Life is grand

1380
01:35:28,531 --> 01:35:31,045
I adore your kisses

1381
01:35:32,051 --> 01:35:34,518
Your trembling lips on mine

1382
01:35:35,530 --> 01:35:38,521
I adore jazz playing

1383
01:35:39,049 --> 01:35:41,517
I'll say it a thousand times.

1384
01:35:42,529 --> 01:35:45,520
I adore life, I adore life

1385
01:35:46,048 --> 01:35:49,040
I adore feeling brave
and not fearing a thing

1386
01:35:50,047 --> 01:35:54,518
Waiting for you, guarding you,
loving you

1387
01:36:00,526 --> 01:36:02,038
Life is grand

1388
01:36:04,045 --> 01:36:07,036
I adore life, I adore life...
