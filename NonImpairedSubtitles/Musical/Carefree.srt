1
00:02:11,077 --> 00:02:12,505
Can I help you, sir?

2
00:02:12,673 --> 00:02:15,030
Yes, just help me steady this thing.

3
00:02:18,790 --> 00:02:20,411
Thank you.

4
00:02:21,948 --> 00:02:24,838
Oh, could you give me
a little information?

5
00:02:25,006 --> 00:02:27,228
- Yes, sir.
- Thank you.

6
00:02:32,420 --> 00:02:34,642
Don't wait up for me.

7
00:02:41,828 --> 00:02:45,580
Please call me when we
get to the 18th floor.

8
00:02:58,317 --> 00:03:00,244
Eighteenth floor, sir.

9
00:03:00,909 --> 00:03:02,666
Thank you so much.

10
00:03:02,837 --> 00:03:04,855
If you run into my
stomach on the way down...

11
00:03:05,032 --> 00:03:07,219
...kindly have it sent up.

12
00:03:15,271 --> 00:03:17,696
- Mr. Arden.
- Where's Tony Flagg? I wanna see him.

13
00:03:17,864 --> 00:03:19,450
Well, come in here, please.

14
00:03:19,626 --> 00:03:23,049
Dr. Flagg's busy right now,
but pipe down and I'll take you.

15
00:03:38,142 --> 00:03:39,469
Well, how do you feel now?

16
00:03:39,638 --> 00:03:42,324
I'm not drunk anymore,
Tony. I'm just dizzy.

17
00:03:42,497 --> 00:03:43,789
All right, we'll unwind you.

18
00:03:43,960 --> 00:03:47,009
Say, Steve, when I went to
Switzerland you never drank like this.

19
00:03:47,185 --> 00:03:48,511
How long have you been tight?

20
00:03:48,680 --> 00:03:51,072
Three days: Yesterday,
today and tomorrow.

21
00:03:51,240 --> 00:03:54,164
Because this Amanda What's-Her-Name
broke her engagement to you?

22
00:03:54,331 --> 00:03:57,222
- Yeah, for the third time.
- What happened the other two times?

23
00:03:57,390 --> 00:03:58,375
I got stiff.

24
00:03:58,554 --> 00:04:00,809
I hope she changes her
mind before you get DTs.

25
00:04:00,981 --> 00:04:02,771
That's why I came to
see you, about her.

26
00:04:02,942 --> 00:04:05,628
You came to the right man.
He's straightened out some pips.

27
00:04:05,801 --> 00:04:08,555
We had a dame here yesterday
who was in love with her feet.

28
00:04:08,726 --> 00:04:10,879
Sorry, Steve, I'm no marriage broker.

29
00:04:11,053 --> 00:04:12,708
Now, this Amanda
What's-Her-Name...

30
00:04:12,882 --> 00:04:16,067
Stop calling her What's-Her-Name.
Her name's Cooper, Amanda Cooper.

31
00:04:16,239 --> 00:04:19,526
I don't care what her name is. To
me, she's another maladjusted woman.

32
00:04:19,696 --> 00:04:21,952
She's in perfect order.
She's beautiful, Tony.

33
00:04:22,123 --> 00:04:23,880
That has nothing to do with it either.

34
00:04:24,051 --> 00:04:26,307
Perhaps she's merely
trying to escape reality.

35
00:04:26,478 --> 00:04:28,269
Escape what reality?

36
00:04:28,440 --> 00:04:30,026
- In this case, you.
- What do you...?

37
00:04:30,202 --> 00:04:31,788
We all try to escape reality.

38
00:04:31,963 --> 00:04:34,887
We all wanna be something entirely
different than we really are.

39
00:04:35,056 --> 00:04:38,705
- When I was a kid, I wanted to be a fireman.
- Sure. I wanted to be a cop.

40
00:04:38,878 --> 00:04:41,564
Remember when we were in
college how stage-struck I was?

41
00:04:41,737 --> 00:04:42,960
I wanted to be a dancer.

42
00:04:43,134 --> 00:04:45,060
Psychoanalysis showed me I was wrong.

43
00:04:45,228 --> 00:04:48,843
It's the one way we have of finding out
what we really want and why we want it.

44
00:04:49,018 --> 00:04:51,205
I wanna marry Amanda, and I know why.

45
00:04:51,978 --> 00:04:54,868
Perhaps if I psychoanalyze you,
you won't wanna marry Amanda.

46
00:04:55,036 --> 00:04:57,019
Well, I don't wanna
not wanna marry Amanda.

47
00:04:57,197 --> 00:05:00,517
Easy, Mr. Arden. You don't
have to say everything twice.

48
00:05:00,688 --> 00:05:02,739
- What do you want?
- I wanna marry Amanda.

49
00:05:02,915 --> 00:05:05,340
I guess he wants to marry
What's-Her-Name, all right.

50
00:05:05,508 --> 00:05:07,026
Tony, you've just got to see her.

51
00:05:07,203 --> 00:05:10,025
Why not, doc? She might turn
out to be a very interesting nut.

52
00:05:10,195 --> 00:05:11,917
Maybe this Amanda
What's-Her-Name...

53
00:05:12,090 --> 00:05:13,416
Cooper!

54
00:05:13,586 --> 00:05:16,102
Maybe she prefers staying
on the stage to marrying you.

55
00:05:16,279 --> 00:05:17,831
No, no, no. She wants to marry me.

56
00:05:18,008 --> 00:05:20,093
Why does she keep breaking
off the engagement?

57
00:05:20,268 --> 00:05:23,226
She doesn't know. She says
it's not my fault, it's hers.

58
00:05:23,393 --> 00:05:26,351
At least see her. Maybe you can
figure out what the trouble is.

59
00:05:26,518 --> 00:05:29,103
Well, how do you know she's
willing to be psychoanalyzed?

60
00:05:29,277 --> 00:05:30,761
Oh, she will if I ask her to.

61
00:05:30,939 --> 00:05:34,192
All right. Tell her to come to my
office tomorrow morning at 11:00.

62
00:05:34,363 --> 00:05:35,881
Now, what's her name?

63
00:05:36,059 --> 00:05:37,680
Amanda
What's-Her-Name.

64
00:05:37,854 --> 00:05:39,973
- Cooper.
- Yeah.

65
00:05:46,264 --> 00:05:49,778
Memo to Dr. Jones. Case history
3442, Mrs. Mamie Fletcher.

66
00:05:49,954 --> 00:05:53,071
Dr. Jones, I am turning this case
over to you for further treatment.

67
00:05:53,245 --> 00:05:54,866
My observations are as follows:

68
00:05:55,040 --> 00:05:58,395
She's a typical pampered female.
What she needs, instead of a doctor...

69
00:05:58,564 --> 00:06:01,284
...is a good spanking. However...

70
00:06:02,487 --> 00:06:04,142
- Yes, Dr. Powers.
- Dr. Flagg...

71
00:06:04,315 --> 00:06:06,276
...can you come to
my laboratory, please?

72
00:06:06,443 --> 00:06:08,234
There's a Miss Cooper waiting for me.

73
00:06:08,405 --> 00:06:11,295
She's another one of those dizzy,
silly, maladjusted females...

74
00:06:11,463 --> 00:06:14,817
...who can't make up her mind. I'll
probably find out she hasn't got one.

75
00:06:14,987 --> 00:06:17,967
- I just need you for a moment.
- All right, I'll be right out.

76
00:06:26,855 --> 00:06:28,282
How do you do, Miss Cooper?

77
00:06:28,451 --> 00:06:30,502
I am Miss Cooper.

78
00:06:36,695 --> 00:06:38,985
Well, won't you come in, please?

79
00:06:39,155 --> 00:06:41,116
Thank you, doctor.

80
00:06:45,039 --> 00:06:47,963
I've been looking forward with
so much pleasure to this meeting.

81
00:06:48,131 --> 00:06:51,554
I'm sorry, I have to leave you, but
if you'll make yourself comfortable...

82
00:06:51,720 --> 00:06:53,873
...I'll be back, and we
can have a nice visit.

83
00:06:54,048 --> 00:06:57,697
Well, I'm certain I'm going to enjoy
it. Steve thinks so much of you.

84
00:06:57,871 --> 00:07:01,758
Steve's a fine chap. Yes, indeed.

85
00:07:02,227 --> 00:07:03,881
And very lucky too.

86
00:07:04,055 --> 00:07:05,381
Excuse me.

87
00:07:14,692 --> 00:07:18,240
<i>Memo to Dr. Jones. Case history
3442, Mrs. Mamie Fletcher.</i>

88
00:07:18,416 --> 00:07:21,532
<i>Dr. Jones, I am turning this case

89
00:07:21,707 --> 00:07:24,665

91
00:07:30,318 --> 00:07:31,507
<i>Yes, Dr. Powers.</i>

92
00:07:31,680 --> 00:07:33,970
<i>Dr. Flagg, will you come
to my laboratory, please?</i>

93
00:07:34,140 --> 00:07:36,192
<i>There's a Miss Cooper
waiting outside for me.</i>

94
00:07:36,367 --> 00:07:39,257
<i>She's another one of those dizzy,

96
00:07:45,377 --> 00:07:47,734
<i>I don't wanna be
disturbed, Miss Adams.</i>

97
00:07:50,530 --> 00:07:52,388
Now there'll be no
more disturbances...

98
00:07:52,557 --> 00:07:55,039
...and we can have that
nice, friendly little chat.

99
00:07:55,216 --> 00:07:57,109
Won't you sit down?

100
00:08:00,702 --> 00:08:02,686
Oh, that's my chair.

101
00:08:02,863 --> 00:08:04,189
Very comfortable.

102
00:08:04,358 --> 00:08:07,215
But I'd planned for you to sit
here. I want you to be relaxed.

103
00:08:07,384 --> 00:08:10,773
I'm perfectly relaxed.
Perhaps you'd better sit there.

104
00:08:14,498 --> 00:08:16,050
Are you always this nervous?

105
00:08:17,124 --> 00:08:20,841
No. Only I usually sit in that chair.

106
00:08:21,014 --> 00:08:24,165
Well, I won't be here very
long, and then you can sit in it.

107
00:08:24,338 --> 00:08:28,260
Oh, now... Now, Miss Cooper,
first let's get to know each other.

108
00:08:28,793 --> 00:08:30,482
Why?

109
00:08:30,721 --> 00:08:32,976
I have to know your mind
as well as I know my own.

110
00:08:33,414 --> 00:08:35,035
Why?

111
00:08:36,040 --> 00:08:39,554
Miss Cooper, you understand the
principle of psychoanalysis, don't you?

112
00:08:40,129 --> 00:08:41,285
No.

113
00:08:41,458 --> 00:08:45,640
Well, you do know that you have two
minds: The conscious and the subconscious.

114
00:08:45,813 --> 00:08:46,867
Really?

115
00:08:47,974 --> 00:08:49,435
The conscious mind is the ego.

116
00:08:49,603 --> 00:08:53,581
That's the thing that says,
"I am I, and you are you. "

117
00:08:54,689 --> 00:08:55,946
Mine never said that.

118
00:09:00,806 --> 00:09:02,427
Let me put it this way, then.

119
00:09:03,665 --> 00:09:07,552
Back here is a jungle full of the
most noble and horrible things.

120
00:09:08,221 --> 00:09:09,547
I don't doubt that.

121
00:09:11,479 --> 00:09:12,940
That's your subconscious mind.

122
00:09:13,108 --> 00:09:15,499
It works all the time,
even when you sleep.

123
00:09:15,667 --> 00:09:18,024
It dreams. It never forgets anything.

124
00:09:18,958 --> 00:09:20,476
Is that so?

125
00:09:22,250 --> 00:09:26,466
Your conscious mind lies here.
It doesn't dream, it thinks.

126
00:09:26,637 --> 00:09:30,083
Now, what we strive for is perfect
coordination between the two.

127
00:09:30,261 --> 00:09:31,882
Do you understand?

128
00:09:32,089 --> 00:09:34,674
No. And I don't believe I care to.

129
00:09:35,048 --> 00:09:37,633
At first I wasn't sure I
wanted to be psychoanalyzed.

130
00:09:37,807 --> 00:09:39,235
And now I'm positive I don't.

131
00:09:39,403 --> 00:09:41,862
Now, you mustn't put a wall
between us, Miss Cooper.

132
00:09:42,029 --> 00:09:44,783
To psychoanalyze you, I
must interpret your dreams.

133
00:09:44,955 --> 00:09:47,176
What sort of things do you dream?

134
00:09:47,349 --> 00:09:48,776
I don't dream.

135
00:09:48,944 --> 00:09:51,925
- Oh, come, now. Everybody dreams.
- I don't.

136
00:09:52,102 --> 00:09:55,684
I wish you'd please understand that I'm
only trying to help you find yourself.

137
00:09:55,858 --> 00:09:58,782
Well, if I ever get
lost, I'll call on you.

138
00:10:02,241 --> 00:10:06,458
Attention, everybody. Having tied on the
shoot-off, Judge Travers and Mr. Arden...

139
00:10:06,629 --> 00:10:11,639
...have decided to break the tie by
a miss-and-out event at single bird.

140
00:10:13,212 --> 00:10:14,673
Pull.

141
00:10:18,164 --> 00:10:19,491
- Lost bird.
- Too bad, Stephen.

142
00:10:19,661 --> 00:10:22,245
You've been shooting as
if you'd been on a bender.

143
00:10:22,420 --> 00:10:24,278
I feel as if I had been.

144
00:10:24,448 --> 00:10:26,069
Nice shooting.

145
00:10:26,975 --> 00:10:29,434
Tony, what did you do to Amanda?

146
00:10:29,601 --> 00:10:30,825
What did I do?

147
00:10:30,997 --> 00:10:33,921
Oh, I'm sorry. I want you to meet
Amanda's Aunt Cora. Dr. Flagg.

148
00:10:34,088 --> 00:10:36,072
- How do you do?
- Amanda's furious with you.

149
00:10:36,249 --> 00:10:38,142
What happened? She wouldn't tell me.

150
00:10:38,311 --> 00:10:39,603
She's a very curious case.

151
00:10:39,773 --> 00:10:41,598
At first, she was
sweet and charming...

152
00:10:41,768 --> 00:10:44,319
...then, for no reason at
all, she became argumentative.

153
00:10:44,494 --> 00:10:46,545
You should hear what
she thinks about you.

154
00:10:47,253 --> 00:10:49,768
- What?
- She thinks you're a quack.

155
00:10:49,946 --> 00:10:51,532
Oh, she does?

156
00:10:53,005 --> 00:10:54,228
Pull.

157
00:10:59,520 --> 00:11:03,374
Very good. Very good, Your Honor.
Your shooting was superb, Your Honor.

158
00:11:03,543 --> 00:11:04,971
- Thank you.
- You're welcome.

159
00:11:05,139 --> 00:11:07,065
His Honor Judge Travers, Dr. Flagg.

160
00:11:07,233 --> 00:11:09,318
- Judge Travers.
- How do you do?

161
00:11:09,493 --> 00:11:12,610
Well, I beat you today, Stephen.
That makes us even-steven.

162
00:11:12,785 --> 00:11:14,904
Well, just wait for the finals.

163
00:11:15,079 --> 00:11:18,467
- How'd you like my exhibition, Cora?
- Pretty good, Joe, I guess.

164
00:11:18,636 --> 00:11:20,529
Pretty good? It was pretty perfect.

165
00:11:20,697 --> 00:11:23,179
If you could only play
bridge the way you play scat.

166
00:11:23,356 --> 00:11:26,144
It's skeet, and besides,
you don't play it.

167
00:11:26,714 --> 00:11:30,658
That's what I mean, Joe.
You don't play bridge either.

168
00:11:43,834 --> 00:11:46,622
You're getting terrific lengths
with your drives, Dr. Flagg.

169
00:11:47,624 --> 00:11:50,877
Thank you, Mr. MacPherson.
You're very, very encouraging.

170
00:11:51,048 --> 00:11:53,100
It's about time, Mac.

171
00:12:18,075 --> 00:12:21,090
Quack. Have you any suggestions?

172
00:12:21,266 --> 00:12:23,725
Maybe you were hitting it
with your subconscious mind.

173
00:12:23,893 --> 00:12:25,910
You know, the one that dreams.

174
00:12:26,087 --> 00:12:27,775
Smack it once with your conscious.

175
00:12:27,949 --> 00:12:29,501
It'll go when I hit it.

176
00:12:29,677 --> 00:12:32,601
What happened to that theory of
coordination you were hot about?

177
00:12:32,769 --> 00:12:36,351
- Doing several things at the same time.
- Oh, that.

178
00:12:36,691 --> 00:12:39,649
Murph, set them up.

179
00:15:36,076 --> 00:15:38,467
What's the matter, Aunt
Cora? Did you lose something?

180
00:15:38,637 --> 00:15:40,688
Not that I know of. Why?

181
00:15:40,863 --> 00:15:42,915
You keep looking back all the time.

182
00:15:43,091 --> 00:15:45,347
Oh, I was looking for that Dr. Quack.

183
00:15:45,518 --> 00:15:47,003
Flagg?

184
00:15:48,344 --> 00:15:49,771
Is he coming, Steve?

185
00:15:49,939 --> 00:15:51,956
It seems silly to keep it a secret.

186
00:15:52,134 --> 00:15:54,718
He said he wanted to
psychoanalyze you on your bicycle.

187
00:15:54,892 --> 00:15:56,910
Oh, so that's why we came.

188
00:15:57,086 --> 00:16:00,532
I wouldn't mind being
analyzed by him on my bicycle.

189
00:16:00,710 --> 00:16:02,432
Or on anything, come to think of it.

190
00:16:08,024 --> 00:16:10,041
Well, well, what luck.

191
00:16:10,218 --> 00:16:13,334
- None.
- Well, Tony, what a pleasant surprise.

192
00:16:16,135 --> 00:16:19,354
Steve, can't you see that Dr.
Flagg wants to ride with me alone?

193
00:16:19,526 --> 00:16:20,920
Oh, sorry, Tony.

194
00:16:21,088 --> 00:16:22,981
Want to drop back here
with me, Aunt Cora?

195
00:16:23,150 --> 00:16:25,303
All right, if you
don't try to amuse me.

196
00:16:29,100 --> 00:16:30,460
Well?

197
00:16:30,629 --> 00:16:32,215
Will you please tell me something?

198
00:16:32,391 --> 00:16:35,350
Why were you suddenly
so unfriendly yesterday?

199
00:16:35,516 --> 00:16:38,837
Quote, "Just another one of those
dizzy, silly, maladjusted females...

200
00:16:39,007 --> 00:16:41,330
...who can't make up
her mind," unquote.

201
00:16:42,863 --> 00:16:47,011
Well, of course, that
was before I met you.

202
00:16:47,550 --> 00:16:50,009
Well, I can forgive you
for saying I have no mind...

203
00:16:50,177 --> 00:16:53,860
...but I'm afraid maybe you're
right about my being maladjusted.

204
00:16:54,032 --> 00:16:56,617
We're never really afraid
of anything we understand.

205
00:16:56,792 --> 00:16:58,344
That sounds as if it makes sense.

206
00:16:58,521 --> 00:17:02,204
Of course, if we know the reason
for most fears, we can dispel them.

207
00:17:02,376 --> 00:17:05,130
Very often, fear is
just a simple phobia:

208
00:17:05,303 --> 00:17:08,748
Afraid of darkness,
afraid of great heights...

209
00:17:08,926 --> 00:17:12,315
...afraid of marriage.

210
00:17:21,093 --> 00:17:24,051
- You better put on your brakes, doctor.
- What?

211
00:17:24,217 --> 00:17:25,736
It's getting steep.

212
00:17:32,329 --> 00:17:34,154
Hey, look out.

213
00:17:34,424 --> 00:17:35,942
Take it easy, doctor.

214
00:17:36,451 --> 00:17:37,845
I can't.

215
00:17:38,013 --> 00:17:39,532
Now, don't show off.

216
00:17:39,709 --> 00:17:41,364
I'm not, my chairs broken.

217
00:17:43,599 --> 00:17:45,820
Please, Miss Cooper, look out.

218
00:17:56,797 --> 00:17:58,757
Doctor, are you all right?

219
00:17:58,924 --> 00:18:00,613
Yes, I guess so.

220
00:18:04,376 --> 00:18:06,031
You win.

221
00:18:25,386 --> 00:18:27,142
- Shall you order now, Mr. Arden?
- No.

222
00:18:27,314 --> 00:18:30,396
- We'll wait for Miss Cooper and Dr. Flagg.
- Very good, sir.

223
00:18:31,270 --> 00:18:33,627
Is this one of your
silent treatments, doctor?

224
00:18:33,797 --> 00:18:37,050
Trying to think of some mental
prescription that might induce dreams.

225
00:18:37,220 --> 00:18:39,113
Here we go again.

226
00:18:39,415 --> 00:18:42,634
I hate to be persistent, but
I'm trying to help you and Steve.

227
00:18:42,805 --> 00:18:44,823
And I have to dream?

228
00:18:44,999 --> 00:18:49,918
Well, it would simplify matters,
and it's possible to make you dream.

229
00:18:50,085 --> 00:18:53,338
Well, I'll try anything, if
you can guarantee the dream.

230
00:18:53,510 --> 00:18:54,733
Good.

231
00:18:54,939 --> 00:19:00,482
I imagine women find Dr. Flagg
very charming, especially girls.

232
00:19:00,657 --> 00:19:04,579
Why, Tony's a doctor.
Amanda's only his patient.

233
00:19:04,979 --> 00:19:07,869
He's all wrapped up
in his work, isn't he?

234
00:19:09,300 --> 00:19:10,989
Then you'll eat whatever I order?

235
00:19:11,462 --> 00:19:14,443
To paraphrase, doctor,
you're the doctor.

236
00:19:21,568 --> 00:19:22,860
Behold the guinea pig.

237
00:19:23,030 --> 00:19:25,489
Aunt Cora, Steve, I'm
on a diet to dream.

238
00:19:25,657 --> 00:19:28,309
How marvelous. Who's the lucky man?

239
00:19:28,482 --> 00:19:31,905
Miss Cooper is going to dream tonight
by eating dream-provoking foods.

240
00:19:32,073 --> 00:19:33,829
Tomorrow I'll explain
her dream to her.

241
00:19:34,001 --> 00:19:36,982
I'd eat anything if I thought it
would make my dreams come true.

242
00:19:38,422 --> 00:19:41,245
May I recommend the filet
mignon smothered with mushrooms.

243
00:19:41,414 --> 00:19:44,134
No, thank you. Miss Cooper
would prefer a seafood cocktail.

244
00:19:44,307 --> 00:19:46,596
- Seafood cocktail.
- With whipped cream.

245
00:19:47,465 --> 00:19:49,358
Seafood cocktail with whipped cream?

246
00:19:49,526 --> 00:19:52,178
But not too much whipped
cream, just a soupçon.

247
00:19:52,352 --> 00:19:55,310
- Soupçon.
- Next, I'd like a largish Welsh rarebit.

248
00:19:55,476 --> 00:19:58,299
Instead of the seafood
cocktail with whipped cream?

249
00:19:58,468 --> 00:19:59,692
No.

250
00:19:59,865 --> 00:20:02,947
You mean, madame, she
wishes to eat them both?

251
00:20:03,123 --> 00:20:06,047
- Yes.
- Double up on the cheese.

252
00:20:06,912 --> 00:20:09,836
- I know something that tastes perfectly vile.
- Good, what is it?

253
00:20:10,003 --> 00:20:11,589
Lobster with gobs of mayonnaise.

254
00:20:11,766 --> 00:20:13,318
- Wonderful.
- Oh, yes.

255
00:20:13,494 --> 00:20:14,979
Instead of the Welsh rarebit...

256
00:20:15,156 --> 00:20:17,208
...and seafood cocktail
with whipped cream?

257
00:20:17,384 --> 00:20:19,606
- No, all of them.
- That lobster sounds wonderful.

258
00:20:19,777 --> 00:20:20,967
Bring me an order of that.

259
00:20:21,140 --> 00:20:24,325
Pardon, madame, but that all
makes a very bad combination.

260
00:20:24,498 --> 00:20:25,721
Yes, I know.

261
00:20:25,894 --> 00:20:28,014
Now all you need is
a good, solid dessert.

262
00:20:31,280 --> 00:20:35,099
May I suggest cucumbers
and buttermilk.

263
00:20:35,269 --> 00:20:36,753
- Yes.
- Wonderful.

264
00:20:36,964 --> 00:20:39,617
And a side order of
strawberry shortcake.

265
00:20:39,790 --> 00:20:42,544
- Have you got all that?
- Yes.

266
00:20:44,012 --> 00:20:45,939
<i>Seafood cocktail with whipped cream.</i>

267
00:20:46,405 --> 00:20:48,389
<i>A largish Welsh rarebit.</i>

268
00:20:48,965 --> 00:20:51,651
<i>Lobster with gobs of mayonnaise.</i>

269
00:20:52,422 --> 00:20:55,437
<i>Cucumbers and buttermilk.</i>

270
00:21:06,185 --> 00:21:09,200
I think I better go home
and go to bed, Amanda.

271
00:21:09,376 --> 00:21:11,234
Oh, no, the furs just beginning.

272
00:21:11,405 --> 00:21:14,329
Mine got near the end when you
ate that second Welsh rarebit.

273
00:21:14,496 --> 00:21:17,975
- Please, let's forget the experiment.
- Don't you feel sleepy, Miss Cooper?

274
00:21:18,153 --> 00:21:19,513
Never felt better in my life.

275
00:21:19,682 --> 00:21:22,539
In fact, now I'm sorry I had
to pass up that second lobster.

276
00:21:22,707 --> 00:21:24,463
<i>Oh, Amanda, please.</i>

277
00:21:24,636 --> 00:21:26,222
Are you sure you're not sleepy?

278
00:21:26,397 --> 00:21:28,822
Not a bit. I'll go
mix you some drinks.

279
00:21:36,504 --> 00:21:38,521
Well, as long as your
niece feels so well...

280
00:21:38,698 --> 00:21:42,619
...and Steve is obviously not so
good, I think I'd better see him home.

281
00:21:42,787 --> 00:21:44,180
Good night, Miss Cooper.

282
00:21:45,113 --> 00:21:46,575
Good night.

283
00:21:49,169 --> 00:21:51,288
Come on, there's nothing
really wrong with you.

284
00:21:51,463 --> 00:21:54,649
It's all in your mind. Think you're
all right and you'll be all right.

285
00:21:54,821 --> 00:21:56,838
Oh, but those cucumbers
and buttermilk...

286
00:21:57,015 --> 00:22:00,131
...and lobsters and
strawberry shortca...

287
00:22:02,533 --> 00:22:04,426
See what I mean?

288
00:22:04,594 --> 00:22:07,779
Oh, doctor, here's the sedative
you asked me to bring over.

289
00:22:10,844 --> 00:22:13,892
Connors, you better go in there,
give Miss Cooper a teaspoonful.

290
00:22:14,069 --> 00:22:17,492
- It's very important. Make her take it.
- Miss Cooper, yes, sir.

291
00:22:19,819 --> 00:22:23,005
Steve, maybe we better walk down.

292
00:22:26,668 --> 00:22:28,787
- Are you Miss Cooper?
- Yes.

293
00:22:28,961 --> 00:22:31,681
Dr. Flagg sent me to take care of you.

294
00:22:31,854 --> 00:22:34,936
Well, how nice of Dr. Flagg.

295
00:22:35,112 --> 00:22:36,698
Come in.

296
00:22:40,431 --> 00:22:43,015
What does he think should be done?

297
00:22:43,190 --> 00:22:47,168
Well, I'm gonna give you something
that'll relax you completely.

298
00:22:49,273 --> 00:22:50,894
Sit down.

299
00:22:51,501 --> 00:22:54,324
Perhaps we'd better
talk this over first.

300
00:22:54,493 --> 00:22:57,111
Now, first, I want you
to have confidence in me.

301
00:22:57,286 --> 00:23:00,300
I have a feeling I'm going to
have complete confidence in you.

302
00:23:00,477 --> 00:23:01,803
Well, that's just fine.

303
00:23:04,598 --> 00:23:06,582
I'm so glad you're a
friend of Dr. Flagg's.

304
00:23:06,759 --> 00:23:08,946
I have no confidence in strangers.

305
00:23:09,485 --> 00:23:11,604
Dr. Flagg is a remarkable man.

306
00:23:11,779 --> 00:23:15,565
Dr. Flagg always knows what's best.

307
00:23:15,735 --> 00:23:17,321
I can believe that.

308
00:23:17,497 --> 00:23:18,924
Now...

309
00:23:19,256 --> 00:23:21,545
I want you to take just
a little sip of this.

310
00:23:21,716 --> 00:23:24,141
All right. What is it?

311
00:23:24,309 --> 00:23:28,390
It... It'll help relax you.

312
00:23:30,625 --> 00:23:33,878
All right, but I'm not at all nervous.

313
00:23:37,174 --> 00:23:39,101
Now, go right in and go to bed.

314
00:24:20,790 --> 00:24:22,251
<i>Cocktail with whipped cream.</i>

315
00:24:22,419 --> 00:24:23,903
<i>A good, solid dessert.</i>

316
00:24:24,081 --> 00:24:26,539
<i>Cucumbers and buttermilk.</i>

317
00:24:26,707 --> 00:24:29,688
<i>Gobs of mayonnaise.
Strawberry shortcake.</i>

318
00:24:45,656 --> 00:24:51,368
<i>Strange how a dreary
world Can suddenly change</i>

319
00:24:51,540 --> 00:24:55,858
<i>To a world as bright
As the evening star</i>

320
00:24:57,790 --> 00:25:03,673
<i>Queer what a difference
When your vision is clear</i>

321
00:25:03,906 --> 00:25:09,086
<i>And you see things as they really are</i>

322
00:25:11,120 --> 00:25:15,564
<i>I used to be colorblind But I met you</i>

323
00:25:15,741 --> 00:25:18,960
<i>And now I find There's
green in the grass</i>

324
00:25:19,132 --> 00:25:20,854
<i>There's gold in the moon</i>

325
00:25:21,027 --> 00:25:23,577
<i>There's blue in the sky</i>

326
00:25:23,752 --> 00:25:29,828
<i>That semicircle That
was always hanging about</i>

327
00:25:30,534 --> 00:25:35,181
<i>Is not a storm cloud It's a rainbow</i>

328
00:25:35,354 --> 00:25:39,208
<i>You brought the colors out</i>

329
00:25:39,378 --> 00:25:43,889
<i>Believe me, it's really
true Till I met you</i>

330
00:25:44,064 --> 00:25:47,543
<i>I never knew a setting sun</i>

331
00:25:47,722 --> 00:25:51,575
<i>Could paint such beautiful skies</i>

332
00:25:51,744 --> 00:25:57,026
<i>I never knew There
were such lovely colors</i>

333
00:25:57,196 --> 00:26:02,613
<i>And the big surprise Is
the red in your cheeks</i>

334
00:26:02,781 --> 00:26:04,605
<i>The gold in your hair</i>

335
00:26:04,775 --> 00:26:07,563
<i>The blue in your eyes</i>

336
00:28:18,646 --> 00:28:20,630
Aunt Cora, do you believe in dreams?

337
00:28:20,807 --> 00:28:25,386
Certainly. I had a humdinger
last night. If it was a dream.

338
00:28:25,562 --> 00:28:29,744
I had the loveliest time in
mine. Everything happened.

339
00:28:29,917 --> 00:28:33,033
I wasrt so lucky. Nothing happened.

340
00:28:33,706 --> 00:28:35,927
- Lobster?
- Breakfast, lunch or dinner.

341
00:28:36,100 --> 00:28:37,958
I'm taking no chances.

342
00:28:38,127 --> 00:28:40,314
I wanna pick up where
I left off in my dream...

343
00:28:40,687 --> 00:28:41,775
...if I can.

344
00:28:43,613 --> 00:28:46,004
- A big gob of mayonnaise.
- Mayonnaise?

345
00:28:46,172 --> 00:28:48,031
Yes, for the lobster.

346
00:28:50,627 --> 00:28:53,052
In my dream, I was with
the most wonderful man.

347
00:28:53,220 --> 00:28:55,339
Me too. It was so realistic.

348
00:28:55,514 --> 00:28:58,596
- He was all in white.
- Are you sure it was a dream?

349
00:28:58,772 --> 00:29:01,559
Positive. Nothing like that
ever happened to me in real life.

350
00:29:01,730 --> 00:29:04,778
Wonder if it's possible to fall
in love with a man you dream about.

351
00:29:04,955 --> 00:29:06,507
Oh, I'm positive.

352
00:29:07,747 --> 00:29:09,436
Come in.

353
00:29:09,809 --> 00:29:11,531
- Good morning.
- Good morning, Stephen.

354
00:29:11,703 --> 00:29:14,185
Good morning, Amanda. How do you feel?

355
00:29:14,363 --> 00:29:15,791
- Marvelous.
- Did you sleep well?

356
00:29:15,958 --> 00:29:17,250
- Marvelous.
- Well, good.

357
00:29:17,422 --> 00:29:19,507
I thought I'd drive you
over to see Dr. Flagg.

358
00:29:19,681 --> 00:29:20,905
- Marvelous.
- Amanda...

359
00:29:21,078 --> 00:29:23,300
...do you realize
you're being repetitious?

360
00:29:23,471 --> 00:29:26,950
I hate to mention that awful food you
both ate, but I was worried about you.

361
00:29:27,129 --> 00:29:29,520
Just thinking about it
kept me awake all night.

362
00:29:29,821 --> 00:29:31,282
Mayonnaise.

363
00:29:31,450 --> 00:29:33,105
Marvelous.

364
00:29:42,221 --> 00:29:43,977
Tony, it happened. Congratulate us.

365
00:29:44,149 --> 00:29:46,902
- Did you get married?
- Not quite, but Amanda dreamed.

366
00:29:47,075 --> 00:29:49,557
Well, Miss Cooper. So our
little experiment worked.

367
00:29:49,734 --> 00:29:51,026
Yes, doctor, marvelously.

368
00:29:51,197 --> 00:29:53,916
Sit right down now, Amanda,
and tell us all about it.

369
00:29:54,089 --> 00:29:56,604
Steve, this is a matter
between Miss Cooper and myself.

370
00:29:56,782 --> 00:30:00,760
Why? We're all in on it. If there's anything
I shouldn't know, I ought to know it now.

371
00:30:00,937 --> 00:30:03,862
Women tell their doctors things
they don't want anyone to hear.

372
00:30:04,029 --> 00:30:07,746
- I know, but I'm gonna be her husband.
- Especially husbands.

373
00:30:11,441 --> 00:30:14,694
Now, Miss Cooper, tell
me all about your dream.

374
00:30:16,860 --> 00:30:19,977
- Did you dream of anyone in particular?
- Yes.

375
00:30:20,151 --> 00:30:21,545
Fine. Who was it?

376
00:30:25,471 --> 00:30:26,830
Oh, I can't.

377
00:30:27,099 --> 00:30:29,185
Now, Miss Cooper, don't
think of me as anyone.

378
00:30:29,360 --> 00:30:32,545
Just think of me as your doctor.
You must have every confidence in me.

379
00:30:32,718 --> 00:30:34,145
Oh, I have.

380
00:30:34,314 --> 00:30:35,775
Then tell me all about it.

381
00:30:40,696 --> 00:30:42,124
I can't.

382
00:30:42,292 --> 00:30:44,049
Very well.

383
00:30:44,918 --> 00:30:47,899
Thank you very much. That's all.

384
00:30:48,242 --> 00:30:50,260
Well, doctor, when do
you wanna see me again?

385
00:30:50,436 --> 00:30:52,159
There's no point in seeing you again.

386
00:30:52,331 --> 00:30:54,382
Oh, but you must. I mean...

387
00:30:54,559 --> 00:30:56,848
Well, I'll recommend
several other doctors to you.

388
00:30:57,019 --> 00:31:00,101
And no doubt you'll find one in
whom you'll have more confidence.

389
00:31:00,277 --> 00:31:01,863
But I don't want another doctor.

390
00:31:02,038 --> 00:31:05,087
Miss Cooper, I was persuaded
by Steve to talk to you.

391
00:31:05,263 --> 00:31:09,049
And from what I see, there's
nothing very wrong with you.

392
00:31:10,483 --> 00:31:11,706
Are you sure?

393
00:31:11,879 --> 00:31:14,860
Compared to complex cases,
which really need me...

394
00:31:15,037 --> 00:31:16,465
...no.

395
00:31:16,632 --> 00:31:19,919
Oh, what... Oh, well, then...

396
00:31:20,090 --> 00:31:22,913
...I guess I'd better
tell you my dream.

397
00:31:24,910 --> 00:31:27,733
I've had it for 11 straight years.

398
00:31:29,166 --> 00:31:30,956
Tell me about it.

399
00:31:44,524 --> 00:31:48,672
Well, you've heard of Little
Red Riding Hood and the wolf?

400
00:31:48,846 --> 00:31:50,069
Yes, I have.

401
00:31:50,241 --> 00:31:52,293
Well, that's what I dreamed about.

402
00:31:52,469 --> 00:31:54,725
You dreamed you were
Little Red Riding Hood?

403
00:31:54,895 --> 00:31:57,252
No, I was the wolf.

404
00:31:58,021 --> 00:31:59,244
What did you do?

405
00:32:00,680 --> 00:32:02,573
I snarled.

406
00:32:06,332 --> 00:32:08,451
And then I...

407
00:32:08,924 --> 00:32:13,900
All of a sudden, I became
Little Red Riding Hood...

408
00:32:14,144 --> 00:32:18,065
...and then suddenly
I was a lot of numbers.

409
00:32:18,233 --> 00:32:22,154
- Numbers?
- Yes, I... I was a radio dial.

410
00:32:22,322 --> 00:32:25,676
Understandable. That's part of your
profession, singing on the radio?

411
00:32:25,846 --> 00:32:28,736
Yes. Yes, but you
haven't heard it all yet.

412
00:32:28,904 --> 00:32:31,862
It seemed that all night long,
there were thousands of people...

413
00:32:32,029 --> 00:32:35,043
...that kept turning me
off and turning me on...

414
00:32:35,220 --> 00:32:36,942
...turning me off and turning me on.

415
00:32:37,115 --> 00:32:41,728
Half the time I was singing, and
the other half I was advertising.

416
00:32:41,902 --> 00:32:47,910
Then... Then there were voices.
Voices, thousands of voices...

417
00:32:48,085 --> 00:32:51,905
...and then they started to
chase me, to persecute me.

418
00:32:52,074 --> 00:32:54,760
- Who?
- My persecutors.

419
00:32:54,934 --> 00:32:57,620
- Persecution complex.
- Yes.

420
00:32:57,859 --> 00:33:02,109
And then... Then I was
running away from them...

421
00:33:02,281 --> 00:33:04,434
...and I was gaining
miles ahead of them...

422
00:33:04,607 --> 00:33:08,789
...when all of a sudden,
I turned into a maple tree.

423
00:33:08,962 --> 00:33:13,439
And then I took a
shortcut across the stream.

424
00:33:13,617 --> 00:33:18,298
And a huge fish raised itself out
of the water and snapped at me.

425
00:33:18,470 --> 00:33:19,693
It was a dogfish.

426
00:33:19,866 --> 00:33:23,686
Then I looked behind me, and
thousands... Thousands of squirrels...

427
00:33:23,856 --> 00:33:27,743
...had jumped the river and like a pack
of hungry wolves were rushing at me.

428
00:33:27,911 --> 00:33:30,268
- Oh, I was frantic.
- Yes.

429
00:33:30,437 --> 00:33:31,956
- They were coming closer.
- Yes.

430
00:33:32,133 --> 00:33:33,889
- They were on me from every side.
- Yes.

431
00:33:34,061 --> 00:33:35,750
- From the front.
- Yes.

432
00:33:35,923 --> 00:33:37,407
- From the back.
- Yes.

433
00:33:37,585 --> 00:33:40,872
From all sides of me,
their teeth snapping at me.

434
00:33:41,042 --> 00:33:43,264
- I couldn't escape.
- What happened?

435
00:33:44,233 --> 00:33:45,785
They got me.

436
00:33:47,824 --> 00:33:51,269
- Please, could I have just a little water?
- Oh, yes, of course.

437
00:33:57,630 --> 00:33:58,854
Yes, Dr. Flagg?

438
00:33:59,027 --> 00:34:01,612
Dr. Powers, will you please
come right over to my office.

439
00:34:06,241 --> 00:34:08,564
Oh, thank you, doctor.

440
00:34:11,692 --> 00:34:14,617
- Are you all right?
- Yes, quite all right. Thank you, doctor.

441
00:34:14,784 --> 00:34:17,742
Then if you'll excuse
me, I'll just be a moment.

442
00:34:23,494 --> 00:34:26,044
- She's wonderful, Steve.
- Of course she is. I know that.

443
00:34:26,221 --> 00:34:30,267
She's a mass of the most horrible neuroses
and inhibitions I've come in contact with.

444
00:34:30,442 --> 00:34:32,664
- What's the matter with her?
- What is it, doctor?

445
00:34:32,835 --> 00:34:35,850
I've run across the most beautiful
case of complex maladjustments.

446
00:34:36,027 --> 00:34:37,716
- Where?
- In there, in my office.

447
00:34:37,888 --> 00:34:39,872
This is one of the
happiest days of my life.

448
00:34:40,049 --> 00:34:42,305
- What did you find, old chap?
- Vulpine complex.

449
00:34:42,476 --> 00:34:44,494
- Child psychosis, a classic example.
- No.

450
00:34:44,670 --> 00:34:47,186
- Yes.
- My congratulations, old chap. I envy you.

451
00:34:47,363 --> 00:34:49,619
- What's wrong with her?
- I'll find a million more.

452
00:34:50,489 --> 00:34:52,880
She's untapped. She's got
everything wrong with her.

453
00:34:53,050 --> 00:34:54,738
- You mean Amanda?
- Follow it through.

454
00:34:54,911 --> 00:34:57,960
- How long do you think it'll take?
- Years. Five, 10. We never know.

455
00:34:58,136 --> 00:34:59,791
Will you assist me in my laboratory?

456
00:34:59,964 --> 00:35:02,287
Delighted. I can hardly wait.

457
00:35:02,690 --> 00:35:05,013
Mind telling me what's the
matter with Miss Cooper?

458
00:35:05,184 --> 00:35:08,732
Not at all. She sounds
like a textbook case.

459
00:35:11,034 --> 00:35:12,689
Well, how do we feel now?

460
00:35:12,862 --> 00:35:14,948
A little tired, doctor.

461
00:35:15,223 --> 00:35:16,480
But, oh, so relieved.

462
00:35:16,652 --> 00:35:18,976
Now, there's absolutely
nothing to be afraid of.

463
00:35:19,146 --> 00:35:21,503
I know that, doctor,
because I'm in your hands.

464
00:35:21,672 --> 00:35:25,650
Good. Now, first, I'm gonna
give you an anesthetic.

465
00:35:25,827 --> 00:35:27,051
Well, what for?

466
00:35:27,224 --> 00:35:29,615
It'll effect a temporary
release of any inhibitions.

467
00:35:29,784 --> 00:35:32,708
It's not a cure, but I can get
an idea of what's wrong with you.

468
00:35:32,875 --> 00:35:35,493
But is an anesthetic necessary?

469
00:35:35,668 --> 00:35:36,891
It's the simplest way.

470
00:35:37,064 --> 00:35:39,024
The effect will wear
off in an hour or so.

471
00:35:39,192 --> 00:35:40,710
And meanwhile I can talk to you.

472
00:35:40,886 --> 00:35:43,278
If you want to talk to
me, why put me to sleep?

473
00:35:43,447 --> 00:35:45,498
I'm going to talk to
your subconscious mind.

474
00:35:45,674 --> 00:35:48,859
It never sleeps. But while under
the influence of an anesthetic...

475
00:35:49,031 --> 00:35:53,678
...we very often say things or do things
we wouldn't under normal conditions.

476
00:35:55,514 --> 00:35:58,666
Well, if you think it's all right.

477
00:35:58,838 --> 00:36:01,592
It gives the doctor a clue
to the patient's personality.

478
00:36:05,687 --> 00:36:09,166
Dr. Powers, this is Miss Cooper,
the young lady I just told you about.

479
00:36:09,343 --> 00:36:11,565
This is a pleasure, a great pleasure.

480
00:36:14,031 --> 00:36:16,014
I'll take your things.

481
00:36:20,945 --> 00:36:23,869
Now, if you'll just
lie here, Miss Cooper.

482
00:36:24,569 --> 00:36:26,926
Try to make your mind a blank.

483
00:36:28,159 --> 00:36:31,083
That'll be very easy
for me to do, doctor.

484
00:36:39,928 --> 00:36:41,979
Now, just relax.

485
00:36:42,288 --> 00:36:44,181
You mustn't be nervous.

486
00:36:44,748 --> 00:36:46,675
Breathe slowly.

487
00:36:53,358 --> 00:36:55,148
Inhale...

488
00:36:56,383 --> 00:36:58,207
<i>...exhale.</i>

489
00:37:01,436 --> 00:37:03,193
That's fine.

490
00:37:04,262 --> 00:37:06,347
Now, Miss Cooper, when
you come out of this...

491
00:37:06,522 --> 00:37:08,812
...I want you to do
whatever you want to do...

492
00:37:08,982 --> 00:37:11,407
...and say whatever you want to say.

493
00:37:11,575 --> 00:37:15,021
For the time being,
release yourself completely.

494
00:37:15,199 --> 00:37:18,089
You will act wholly on
the impulse of the moment.

495
00:37:22,745 --> 00:37:26,565
That'll be all for now.
We'll let her sleep a bit.

496
00:37:32,851 --> 00:37:34,834
Come to my office and
tell me all about it.

497
00:37:35,012 --> 00:37:38,559
- With pleasure.
- These unusual cases excite me so.

498
00:37:39,832 --> 00:37:41,055
This waiting's awful.

499
00:37:41,229 --> 00:37:43,518
- Would you like a drink?
- Oh, I'd love one.

500
00:37:52,565 --> 00:37:54,186
No, thanks.

501
00:37:55,988 --> 00:37:57,211
Yes.

502
00:37:57,385 --> 00:38:00,207
Hold on. It's for you, Mr. Arden.

503
00:38:00,875 --> 00:38:03,425
Hello? I mean, hello.

504
00:38:03,601 --> 00:38:05,119
Yes, Aunt Cora.

505
00:38:05,296 --> 00:38:07,121
Amanda? Yes, she's here.

506
00:38:07,291 --> 00:38:08,753
Stop dawdling, both of you.

507
00:38:08,920 --> 00:38:11,243
Tell Amanda to get to
that broadcasting station.

508
00:38:11,414 --> 00:38:13,204
All right, I'll get her there.

509
00:38:15,103 --> 00:38:16,655
Tony?

510
00:38:16,832 --> 00:38:18,350
Tony!

511
00:38:19,990 --> 00:38:21,542
Tony.

512
00:38:22,616 --> 00:38:24,373
Amanda.

513
00:38:24,944 --> 00:38:27,630
Amanda. Amanda.

514
00:38:28,334 --> 00:38:31,315
Oh, Tony.

515
00:38:31,725 --> 00:38:34,207
This isn't Tony, it's Steve.

516
00:38:34,750 --> 00:38:37,641
- Go away, Steve.
- Amanda, you haven't time to sleep now.

517
00:38:37,809 --> 00:38:40,166
You have a broadcast in 10 minutes.

518
00:38:40,336 --> 00:38:43,690
Oh, yes, I'm looking forward to that.

519
00:38:46,153 --> 00:38:48,443
Amanda, come on.

520
00:38:48,613 --> 00:38:51,072
All right, but don't rush me.

521
00:38:53,301 --> 00:38:56,486
Oh, Steve, what's that?

522
00:38:56,758 --> 00:38:58,980
Oh, Amanda.

523
00:39:01,013 --> 00:39:02,871
Button, button.

524
00:39:09,955 --> 00:39:11,813
- Oh, boy!
- Oh, boy.

525
00:39:11,983 --> 00:39:15,429
- Oh, Amanda.
- Oh, Amanda.

526
00:39:48,185 --> 00:39:50,237
Amanda, are you all right?

527
00:39:50,413 --> 00:39:52,804
Simply marvelous. It's a present.

528
00:39:55,964 --> 00:39:58,220
Very funny.

529
00:39:58,557 --> 00:40:00,347
Good day.

530
00:40:02,680 --> 00:40:05,003
- Will you get us a cab, please?
- Yes, sir. Careful.

531
00:40:06,502 --> 00:40:08,758
Taxi. Taxi.

532
00:40:10,129 --> 00:40:11,886
Amalgamated Broadcasting Company.

533
00:40:12,057 --> 00:40:14,347
Take Madison Avenue and hurry.

534
00:40:45,633 --> 00:40:48,148
- Steve, where's Miss Cooper?
- I don't know, she's gone.

535
00:40:48,326 --> 00:40:50,876
She's under an anesthetic.
What'd you take her away for?

536
00:40:51,052 --> 00:40:54,372
- She has a broadcast in 10 minutes.
- She's in no condition to broadcast.

537
00:40:54,543 --> 00:40:56,730
She's not normal, might
even act a little odd.

538
00:40:56,903 --> 00:40:58,455
Might?

539
00:41:28,285 --> 00:41:29,837
Thank you.

540
00:41:40,685 --> 00:41:42,475
Oh, that's cute.

541
00:41:43,411 --> 00:41:45,167
Do you mind if I try?

542
00:41:45,339 --> 00:41:46,891
Well...

543
00:41:49,661 --> 00:41:51,644
All right, here.

544
00:41:52,419 --> 00:41:54,074
Now swing it.

545
00:41:54,846 --> 00:41:57,600
- Swing it.
- Like that. Swing it.

546
00:42:07,844 --> 00:42:09,771
Amanda, darling, where have you been?

547
00:42:09,938 --> 00:42:12,953
Don't you know we're on
the air in 10 seconds?

548
00:42:15,857 --> 00:42:17,114
Miss Cooper's script.

- Miss Cooper's script.
- Miss Cooper's script.

550
00:42:19,479 --> 00:42:20,964
Here. Here it is.

554
00:42:51,460 --> 00:42:52,820
Hello, you.

555
00:42:52,989 --> 00:42:54,678
All of you.

...speaking on the Amalgamated
Network for Sentela.

...all you have to do is
use Sentela toothpaste.

It makes your teeth happy.

- Miss Cooper, you say the funniest things.
- Oh, thank you very much.

567
00:43:38,798 --> 00:43:41,688
- You're gonna be all right, Miss Cooper.
- Call me Amanda, Tony.

568
00:43:41,857 --> 00:43:43,375
Miss Cooper.

569
00:43:43,851 --> 00:43:45,438
I'm going to sue you for damages.

570
00:43:45,614 --> 00:43:46,804
Don't worry about damages.

571
00:43:46,977 --> 00:43:49,130
Mr. Arden will pay
everything, won't you, Steve?

572
00:43:49,303 --> 00:43:51,196
- Why, yes.
- Amanda, what's happened?

573
00:43:51,365 --> 00:43:54,618
Everything, darling. You
should have been with me.

574
00:43:55,653 --> 00:43:56,945
There you are, young lady.

575
00:43:57,115 --> 00:43:59,574
Just a minute, officer. This
young lady's my patient...

576
00:43:59,742 --> 00:44:02,394
That doesn't give her a right
to destroy private property.

577
00:44:02,568 --> 00:44:05,923
Now, Mr. Arden will pay for any
damage she's done. Wort you, Steve?

578
00:44:06,324 --> 00:44:08,182
Yes.

579
00:44:12,375 --> 00:44:14,358
Are you sure she's all right?

580
00:44:14,536 --> 00:44:16,791
I'll assume every
responsibility for her actions.

581
00:44:17,959 --> 00:44:20,350
Well, as long as everything's
gonna be squared up...

582
00:44:20,520 --> 00:44:22,106
...there's no reason to arrest her.

583
00:44:22,281 --> 00:44:23,743
Thank you, officer.

584
00:44:38,005 --> 00:44:41,892
Amanda, striking an officer
is a very serious offense.

585
00:44:42,061 --> 00:44:45,110
- She didn't strike him, Joe, she kicked him.
- Yeah, and a beaut.

586
00:44:46,881 --> 00:44:48,241
Aunt Cora, please.

587
00:44:48,410 --> 00:44:51,267
I've already explained, judge,
that it was largely my fault.

588
00:44:51,436 --> 00:44:54,054
I'm beginning to
gather that, Dr. Flagg.

589
00:44:54,993 --> 00:44:57,452
Amanda, I've known you all your life.

590
00:44:57,619 --> 00:44:59,171
<i>There's nothing wrong with you.</i>

591
00:44:59,348 --> 00:45:03,235
<i>My advice as a friend is
to give up these treatments.</i>

592
00:45:03,404 --> 00:45:04,831
And my advice as a physician...

593
00:45:04,999 --> 00:45:07,390
<i>...is Miss Cooper should
continue the treatments.</i>

594
00:45:07,558 --> 00:45:11,242
My advice, Joe, is to call the whole
silly thing off before everybody gets sore.

595
00:45:11,415 --> 00:45:14,803
Cora, will you please recognize
that this is an official enquiry?

596
00:45:15,105 --> 00:45:18,551
Oh, all right, I recognize it.
But it doesn't alter my opinion.

597
00:45:21,754 --> 00:45:26,469
Dr. Flagg, it is not within my rights
to prescribe your duties to you...

598
00:45:26,641 --> 00:45:29,327
<i>...but I can warn you that
unless these experiments...</i>

599
00:45:29,499 --> 00:45:31,357
...are confined to your laboratory...

600
00:45:31,528 --> 00:45:34,350
...I will hold you responsible
for Miss Cooper's actions.

601
00:45:34,519 --> 00:45:36,978
<i>- Have I made myself clear?
- Quite.</i>

602
00:45:37,146 --> 00:45:38,607
I'd like to know something, Joe.

603
00:45:38,775 --> 00:45:40,236
- Well?
- Wait a minute, Aunt Cora.

604
00:45:40,404 --> 00:45:42,885
- The judge has been very lenient.
- He's been a dear.

605
00:45:43,063 --> 00:45:47,075
- Just let it wait for another time, dear.
- Oh, all right, then.

606
00:45:47,451 --> 00:45:49,966
Just wanted to ask if he'd
have dinner with us tonight.

607
00:45:50,144 --> 00:45:51,436
I'd be delighted.

608
00:45:52,471 --> 00:45:54,760
There, you see?

609
00:45:59,917 --> 00:46:01,277
Thank you.

610
00:46:01,912 --> 00:46:03,839
Well, Steve, here's to you and Amanda.

611
00:46:04,006 --> 00:46:07,951
Thanks. Here's hoping your
treatments will be successful.

612
00:46:08,128 --> 00:46:12,016
In my day, the women didn't have to
ask their doctor when to get married.

613
00:46:12,184 --> 00:46:15,663
- You're a bachelor, judge?
- Yeah. Yeah.

614
00:46:23,055 --> 00:46:26,274
Were you ever anxious to dance with
a man you dreamed you danced with?

615
00:46:26,445 --> 00:46:28,564
Don't be silly. I never
dream about dancing.

616
00:46:28,740 --> 00:46:31,754
Miss Cooper, Miss Cooper. I'll
tell the gentlemen you're waiting.

617
00:46:31,931 --> 00:46:33,154
Thank you, Henry.

618
00:46:34,890 --> 00:46:37,677
Amanda, what in the
world are you grinning at?

619
00:46:38,479 --> 00:46:41,302
Don't tell anyone, but I'm in love.

620
00:46:41,471 --> 00:46:44,520
Well, get the agony
over and marry him.

621
00:46:44,696 --> 00:46:45,954
He doesn't know it.

622
00:46:46,126 --> 00:46:48,211
I think you're very
nasty to say that, Amanda.

623
00:46:48,386 --> 00:46:50,279
Steve isn't that dumb.

624
00:46:51,012 --> 00:46:53,698
I'm in love with my doctor.

625
00:46:59,091 --> 00:47:01,075
Cora, you invited me
to dinner. Where is it?

626
00:47:01,251 --> 00:47:02,769
Right over there.

627
00:47:10,726 --> 00:47:13,412
You know, I'd like to dance right now.

628
00:47:13,584 --> 00:47:16,770
Don't you think you ought to
dance the first one with Steve?

629
00:47:19,934 --> 00:47:22,756
You'd better let me have
my own way, Dr. Flagg.

630
00:47:22,926 --> 00:47:26,609
Just remember, Judge Travers is
holding you responsible for my actions.

631
00:47:26,783 --> 00:47:29,673
I'd be flattered to dance
the second dance with you.

632
00:47:35,625 --> 00:47:39,274
I'd like to find out who threw
that. I'd give them 90 days.

633
00:47:40,877 --> 00:47:42,271
Dance?

634
00:47:42,440 --> 00:47:45,455
Well, it'll take less
time than 90 days.

635
00:47:56,137 --> 00:47:57,995
Well, I was willing.

636
00:48:04,481 --> 00:48:07,235
Oh, Lou, please do me a
favor and play another number.

637
00:48:07,971 --> 00:48:10,022
I will, if you will sing it.

638
00:48:14,820 --> 00:48:16,281
All right.

639
00:48:31,774 --> 00:48:34,392
<i>Come on and hear the yam man cry</i>

640
00:48:34,566 --> 00:48:37,185
<i>Any yam today?</i>

641
00:48:37,358 --> 00:48:39,874
<i>The sweet potato that he'll fry</i>

642
00:48:40,051 --> 00:48:42,839
<i>Will be yam today</i>

643
00:48:43,508 --> 00:48:46,059
<i>The little step that you'll see him do</i>

644
00:48:46,234 --> 00:48:48,024
<i>With every yam that he sells to you</i>

645
00:48:48,196 --> 00:48:50,780
<i>It's something that you ought to try</i>

646
00:48:50,955 --> 00:48:53,176
<i>Come and yam</i>

647
00:48:54,113 --> 00:48:56,198
<i>Yam</i>

648
00:48:56,374 --> 00:48:58,663
<i>Come on and yam today</i>

649
00:48:59,765 --> 00:49:02,088
<i>Come get what I've got</i>

650
00:49:02,258 --> 00:49:04,683
<i>It will hit the spot</i>

651
00:49:04,851 --> 00:49:08,501
<i>Get your sweet and hot yam</i>

652
00:49:10,037 --> 00:49:15,149
<i>Raise your hand and
sway Like you hold a tray</i>

653
00:49:15,322 --> 00:49:17,374
<i>When you're on your way</i>

654
00:49:17,550 --> 00:49:19,669
<i>Yam</i>

655
00:49:20,774 --> 00:49:25,693
<i>Come on, shake your depression
And let's have a yam session</i>

656
00:49:25,860 --> 00:49:28,013
<i>There's that long note One, two, three</i>

657
00:49:28,188 --> 00:49:30,772
<i>Yam</i>

658
00:49:31,180 --> 00:49:36,224
<i>Every orchestra in America</i>

659
00:49:36,399 --> 00:49:38,858
<i>Will be doing the</i>

660
00:49:39,690 --> 00:49:42,671
<i>Yam</i>

661
00:52:27,071 --> 00:52:31,548
<i>I didn't come to do the Charleston
I didn't come to ball the jack</i>

662
00:52:31,725 --> 00:52:36,338
<i>I didn't come to do the Suzy-Q
Or do the bottom they call black</i>

663
00:52:36,512 --> 00:52:41,125
<i>I didn't come to do big apple
I didn't come to do the shag</i>

664
00:52:41,299 --> 00:52:45,617
<i>Well, honey, here I am to do the
yam Because the yam is in the bag</i>

665
00:53:59,987 --> 00:54:03,206
Funny that I should envy a
man who should really envy me.

666
00:54:03,377 --> 00:54:04,601
I mean, Tony.

667
00:54:04,774 --> 00:54:08,162
I was really jealous, the
way you two danced together.

668
00:54:08,397 --> 00:54:12,047
Steve, I wanna talk to you about Tony.

669
00:54:12,220 --> 00:54:14,147
What's the matter with him?

670
00:54:14,347 --> 00:54:16,863
Nothing. I think he's wonderful.

671
00:54:17,040 --> 00:54:21,427
You don't have to tell me about Tony.
I've known him for years. Swell guy.

672
00:54:21,595 --> 00:54:23,385
Yes, I know.

673
00:54:23,922 --> 00:54:28,138
What I want to say, Steve,
is since I've known Tony...

674
00:54:28,310 --> 00:54:32,288
...I'm convinced for the
first time that I'm in love.

675
00:54:35,059 --> 00:54:36,952
Are you sure?

676
00:54:37,984 --> 00:54:40,375
Yes. I probably shouldn't
have told you like that...

677
00:54:40,543 --> 00:54:42,300
...but I didn't know
how else to say it.

678
00:54:42,471 --> 00:54:44,761
Good old Tony. I knew
he wouldn't let me down.

679
00:54:44,932 --> 00:54:49,614
Amanda, I don't know what else to say
except, I'll make you a wonderful husband.

680
00:54:50,118 --> 00:54:51,739
Steve.

681
00:54:51,913 --> 00:54:54,135
Tony. Aunt Cora.

682
00:54:56,766 --> 00:54:58,953
- Prepare yourselves for a shock.
- She told you.

683
00:54:59,127 --> 00:55:00,350
- Yes.
- What's up, Steve?

684
00:55:00,523 --> 00:55:01,747
My congratulations, Tony.

685
00:55:01,919 --> 00:55:04,504
You accomplished more in a
week than I did in two years.

686
00:55:04,678 --> 00:55:07,364
- I admire the way you're taking it, Steve.
- Why not?

687
00:55:07,537 --> 00:55:09,929
Amanda just told me she's
ready now to marry me.

688
00:55:10,097 --> 00:55:13,213
- Amanda's going to what?
- Judge, I want you to marry us.

689
00:55:13,388 --> 00:55:15,575
- Delighted, delighted.
- Congratulations, Steve.

690
00:55:17,078 --> 00:55:18,733
Put that water down.

691
00:55:18,906 --> 00:55:21,025
Henry, champagne.
Champagne for my friends.

692
00:55:21,201 --> 00:55:24,454
- Amanda, come dance with me.
- Mind if I had this dance with Tony?

693
00:55:24,624 --> 00:55:26,675
Good old Tony. I
should say I don't mind.

694
00:55:27,284 --> 00:55:29,268
We'll have plenty of
time to dance later on.

695
00:55:29,445 --> 00:55:30,907
Come on, Aunt Cora.

696
00:55:31,074 --> 00:55:33,227
Oh, sit down, Joe.

697
00:55:39,817 --> 00:55:41,970
Hold me close, Tony.

698
00:55:43,938 --> 00:55:46,024
I have something to tell you.

699
00:55:46,199 --> 00:55:51,674
Now, no matter what I say or
how it may affect you, smile.

700
00:55:51,851 --> 00:55:53,472
Smile?

701
00:55:53,647 --> 00:55:55,732
And keep smiling.

702
00:55:56,438 --> 00:55:58,024
All right.

703
00:56:01,392 --> 00:56:04,940
Something very
unfortunate has happened.

704
00:56:05,115 --> 00:56:07,234
And you're mixed up in it.

705
00:56:08,805 --> 00:56:11,390
It's my fault entirely.

706
00:56:15,454 --> 00:56:20,339
I was trying to tell Steve that
I didn't want to marry him...

707
00:56:20,773 --> 00:56:23,164
...because I wasn't in love with him.

708
00:56:23,731 --> 00:56:27,551
Because I'm in love with you.

709
00:56:28,685 --> 00:56:30,045
Smile, there's Steve.

710
00:56:34,403 --> 00:56:36,692
What am I going to do?

711
00:56:37,228 --> 00:56:38,951
I don't know.

712
00:56:39,988 --> 00:56:44,963
Well, I can't hurt Steve,
and I just can't marry him.

713
00:56:45,140 --> 00:56:46,726
Of course not.

714
00:56:47,134 --> 00:56:50,092
In the meantime, I think
we'd both better smile.

715
00:57:00,166 --> 00:57:02,184
Sit down, Joe.

716
00:57:04,089 --> 00:57:08,203
You know, Steve, I think you and Amanda
should see me tomorrow in my office.

717
00:57:08,378 --> 00:57:10,531
Say about 11:00.

718
00:57:10,704 --> 00:57:13,628
Oh, no. No more treatments.
Let's let well enough alone.

719
00:57:16,954 --> 00:57:18,348
I think we'd better, Steve.

720
00:57:18,517 --> 00:57:20,874
No, Tony, you've served
your purpose beautifully.

721
00:57:21,043 --> 00:57:23,558
You've been a scientific Cupid.

722
00:57:25,996 --> 00:57:27,889
I'm afraid I'll have to insist, Steve.

723
00:57:28,190 --> 00:57:32,078
Well, as long as you insist. And
if it'll make you happy, old boy.

724
00:57:32,246 --> 00:57:33,832
Amanda can see you in the morning.

725
00:57:34,008 --> 00:57:37,396
- Good evening, Judge Travers.
- Oh, good evening, Grace.

726
00:57:37,565 --> 00:57:40,184
Oh, sit down, Joe.

727
00:57:43,144 --> 00:57:45,297
The doctor will be right out.

728
00:57:47,532 --> 00:57:49,322
- Morning, Amanda. Miss Cooper.
- Morning.

729
00:57:49,493 --> 00:57:51,080
- Good morning. Hello, Connors.
- Hi.

730
00:57:51,255 --> 00:57:54,270
Well, Dr. Flagg, you were absolutely
right to have us all here...

731
00:57:54,446 --> 00:57:57,563
...so you could explain to Steve.
Pity he had to shoot the judge.

732
00:57:57,738 --> 00:58:00,129
I mean, for the finals in
the scat meet this morning.

733
00:58:00,297 --> 00:58:03,550
- Mind if I spoke to your niece alone?
- Certainly not.

734
00:58:04,153 --> 00:58:06,080
Connors, escort Miss
Cooper to her car...

735
00:58:06,248 --> 00:58:08,707
...and wait till Amanda gets
there. She won't be long.

736
00:58:09,140 --> 00:58:10,363
Don't hurry.

737
00:58:10,536 --> 00:58:14,322
Since Mr. Connors is no longer
confused, maybe he'll prove entertaining.

738
00:58:14,492 --> 00:58:17,144
Sure, but I gotta
have a deck of cards.

739
00:58:26,459 --> 00:58:28,148
Please sit down, Amanda.

740
00:58:31,480 --> 00:58:33,032
Amanda...

741
00:58:34,206 --> 00:58:38,921
...that dream you told me
about, it wasn't true, was it?

742
00:58:40,988 --> 00:58:42,245
No, Tony.

743
00:58:43,913 --> 00:58:47,336
You dreamed about me, didn't you?

744
00:58:49,232 --> 00:58:50,524
Yes, Tony.

745
00:58:50,695 --> 00:58:53,777
And as a result of that dream,
you thought you loved me.

746
00:58:55,149 --> 00:58:56,577
Yes, Tony.

747
00:58:59,504 --> 00:59:02,655
Dreams are very
curious things, Amanda.

748
00:59:03,061 --> 00:59:06,246
Very often, the dream fantasy makes
things seem true to the dreamer...

749
00:59:06,751 --> 00:59:09,574
...when in reality, they
have no basis in fact.

750
00:59:11,073 --> 00:59:14,496
When we first met, there was a
confusion in your mind regarding Steve.

751
00:59:15,028 --> 00:59:19,211
When you agreed to our first experiment,
you felt you could be helped by me.

752
00:59:19,683 --> 00:59:23,004
Now, since we learn to depend on
those we are confident can help us...

753
00:59:23,173 --> 00:59:27,855
...it's not at all unusual for that
temporary dependence to be mistaken for love.

754
00:59:29,025 --> 00:59:30,747
In your frame of mind at that time...

755
00:59:30,919 --> 00:59:33,242
...you would've fallen
in love with any doctor.

756
00:59:33,412 --> 00:59:35,599
That's understandable, isn't it?

757
00:59:38,565 --> 00:59:40,492
What's wrong, Amanda?

758
00:59:44,915 --> 00:59:47,963
I guess that I'm just worried
about Steve, that's all.

759
00:59:49,136 --> 00:59:52,888
- Do you still have confidence in me?
- Yes, Tony.

760
00:59:53,060 --> 00:59:54,986
Will you do as I ask?

761
00:59:55,154 --> 00:59:56,910
Yes, Tony.

762
01:00:06,855 --> 01:00:08,873
You just sit here.

763
01:00:14,235 --> 01:00:15,890
Keep your eyes fixed on this light.

764
01:00:26,302 --> 01:00:28,161
Now you're feeling sleepy.

765
01:00:29,826 --> 01:00:31,583
Very sleepy.

766
01:00:32,220 --> 01:00:33,739
Yes, Tony.

767
01:00:36,907 --> 01:00:39,298
Your eyes are growing heavy, Amanda.

768
01:00:39,533 --> 01:00:41,120
Close them.

769
01:00:42,991 --> 01:00:44,747
Close them.

770
01:00:48,011 --> 01:00:49,700
Now you're asleep.

771
01:00:50,105 --> 01:00:52,292
You're fast asleep.

772
01:00:58,050 --> 01:01:00,067
You're in a trance now.

773
01:01:00,245 --> 01:01:02,602
I will bring you out of it shortly.

774
01:01:02,771 --> 01:01:06,126
You will act and be perfectly
normal in every respect...

775
01:01:06,461 --> 01:01:08,920
...except that you will
have these new thoughts...

776
01:01:09,087 --> 01:01:11,637
...which I am about
to put in your mind.

777
01:01:12,046 --> 01:01:15,162
You will remember everything
I'm about to tell you.

778
01:01:15,736 --> 01:01:18,888
Now, repeat after me everything I say:

779
01:01:22,917 --> 01:01:24,900
I love Stephen.

780
01:01:25,078 --> 01:01:26,971
I'm going to marry Stephen.

781
01:01:27,304 --> 01:01:30,523
I love Stephen. I'm
going to marry Stephen.

782
01:01:30,696 --> 01:01:32,951
Dr. Flagg is a horrible monster.

783
01:01:33,255 --> 01:01:36,441
Dr. Flagg is a horrible monster.

784
01:01:36,613 --> 01:01:39,401
Men like him should
be shot down like dogs.

785
01:01:39,571 --> 01:01:42,654
Men like him should
be shot down like dogs.

786
01:01:42,829 --> 01:01:46,683
I love Stephen. I don't love Tony.

787
01:01:46,852 --> 01:01:50,830
I love Stephen. I don't love Tony.

788
01:01:51,306 --> 01:01:52,734
Tony doesn't love me.

789
01:01:53,733 --> 01:01:56,420
Tony doesn't love me.

790
01:01:56,858 --> 01:01:58,943
Tony doesn't love me.

791
01:01:59,618 --> 01:02:01,839
Tony doesn't love me.

792
01:02:02,011 --> 01:02:04,096
- That's enough.
- That's enough.

793
01:02:15,541 --> 01:02:17,297
I'll be right back.

794
01:02:18,666 --> 01:02:20,423
I'll be right back.

795
01:02:28,572 --> 01:02:31,395
What are you acting so silly
about? You don't love that girl.

796
01:02:31,564 --> 01:02:33,026
Oh, yes, you do.

797
01:02:34,556 --> 01:02:36,347
Who said that?

798
01:02:37,847 --> 01:02:41,429
Your subconscious mind. You
know, the one that never sleeps.

799
01:02:41,604 --> 01:02:45,118
If you had any sense, you'd psychoanalyze
yourself and admit you love her.

800
01:02:45,293 --> 01:02:46,880
Nonsense.

801
01:02:48,319 --> 01:02:50,778
What a cluck you are, Tony.

802
01:02:50,945 --> 01:02:52,736
- Why?
- Why?

803
01:02:52,906 --> 01:02:54,890
Because you're so dumb
you didn't realize...

804
01:02:55,067 --> 01:02:57,458
...she was crying because
she's in love with you.

805
01:02:58,258 --> 01:03:00,344
- You really believe that?
- Certainly.

806
01:03:00,519 --> 01:03:02,309
If you doctors weren't
such wise guys...

807
01:03:02,481 --> 01:03:05,099
...you'd forget your
textbooks once in a while.

808
01:03:05,373 --> 01:03:07,028
What do you think I ought to do?

809
01:03:07,201 --> 01:03:10,817
Go in there and take back those
silly ideas you just put in her head.

810
01:03:10,991 --> 01:03:13,043
Yes, and then what?

811
01:03:13,285 --> 01:03:15,937
Then kiss her, you dope.

812
01:03:17,806 --> 01:03:20,197
I think maybe you've
got something there.

813
01:03:21,296 --> 01:03:24,481
I must go to Stephen.
I must drive to Stephen.

814
01:03:24,654 --> 01:03:27,045
All right, but Dr. Flagg
told me to stick around...

815
01:03:27,214 --> 01:03:29,107
...so I'll sit in the rumble seat.

816
01:03:45,032 --> 01:03:47,786
Medwick Country Club, as
fast as you can make it.

817
01:03:51,050 --> 01:03:52,444
<i>Pull.</i>

818
01:03:54,906 --> 01:03:56,662
<i>Dead a pair.</i>

819
01:04:00,125 --> 01:04:02,347
Quiet. Quiet, please.

820
01:04:02,518 --> 01:04:04,705
Quiet, please.

821
01:04:04,879 --> 01:04:07,632
Please. Please, please, please.

822
01:04:07,804 --> 01:04:09,027
Thank you.

823
01:04:09,499 --> 01:04:10,723
Good luck, judge.

824
01:04:10,896 --> 01:04:13,548
Thank you, Steve. Same to
you. You're going to need it.

825
01:04:16,813 --> 01:04:18,241
Stephen.

826
01:04:18,408 --> 01:04:20,732
I must see Stephen.

827
01:04:30,177 --> 01:04:33,192
- Are you ready, gentlemen?
- Pull.

828
01:04:36,294 --> 01:04:38,187
Dead a pair.

829
01:04:48,627 --> 01:04:51,642
Connors. Of all the silly things.

830
01:04:51,819 --> 01:04:53,802
Come out of there.

831
01:04:57,303 --> 01:05:01,621
Honestly, men are such
cowards, hiding like that.

832
01:05:02,490 --> 01:05:04,746
You'll feel better
after you buy me a drink.

833
01:05:13,991 --> 01:05:15,952
- Pull.
- Stephen!

834
01:05:16,419 --> 01:05:19,241
- No birds.
- This is no place for you, Amanda.

835
01:05:19,410 --> 01:05:22,198
- From now on, my place is with Stephen.
- Amanda, darling.

836
01:05:22,369 --> 01:05:24,727
Oh, fiddle-fuddle.

837
01:05:24,896 --> 01:05:26,381
He's a horrible monster.

838
01:05:26,558 --> 01:05:28,780
<i>Men like him should
be shot down like dogs.</i>

839
01:05:28,951 --> 01:05:31,104
I'm sorry, judge, I
don't think she meant you.

840
01:05:32,609 --> 01:05:36,530
- Stephen, I wanna do everything you do.
- That's fine, but right now I want to shoot.

841
01:05:36,697 --> 01:05:38,658
Sorry, judge.

842
01:05:41,019 --> 01:05:42,345
Pull.

843
01:05:46,670 --> 01:05:49,356
- Amanda, you're wonderful.
- So are you, Stephen.

844
01:05:49,529 --> 01:05:52,147
- Did you see that, judge?
- See it? Those are my birds!

845
01:05:52,321 --> 01:05:54,441
Don't lose your temper.
There are plenty more.

846
01:05:54,649 --> 01:05:56,270
<i>Don't lose my temper?</i>

847
01:05:59,831 --> 01:06:02,913
My best hat, a real Tyrollean.

848
01:06:03,089 --> 01:06:06,047
Amanda, this is no time to shoot hats.

849
01:06:06,746 --> 01:06:09,262
I'm sorry, judge.

850
01:06:16,021 --> 01:06:17,642
Thank you, sir.

851
01:06:17,916 --> 01:06:20,138
Amanda. Amanda.

852
01:06:20,309 --> 01:06:22,927
Men like him should
be shot down like dogs.

853
01:06:23,102 --> 01:06:24,824
- Put that gun down, Amanda.
- Amanda.

854
01:06:24,997 --> 01:06:26,220
That's my gun. It's loaded.

855
01:06:26,392 --> 01:06:28,851
Look out, Stephen, I
don't wanna shoot you.

856
01:06:29,219 --> 01:06:31,338
- Put that gun down.
- Put that gun down, Amanda.

857
01:06:31,512 --> 01:06:33,405
- You'll hurt somebody.
- That gun's loaded.

858
01:06:33,574 --> 01:06:34,730
- Look out.
- What...?

859
01:06:35,435 --> 01:06:36,897
- Put that gun down.
- Look out!

860
01:06:37,064 --> 01:06:39,852
Why don't you take
that gun away from her?

861
01:06:43,015 --> 01:06:44,238
What's that?

862
01:06:44,411 --> 01:06:47,267
A thing called scat.
They play it with guns.

863
01:06:53,785 --> 01:06:55,643
What's everybody running for?

864
01:06:55,813 --> 01:06:58,035
Probably one of the silly rules.

865
01:07:02,230 --> 01:07:04,848
Please, please, please.

866
01:07:05,287 --> 01:07:08,404
- What's the matter with Amanda?
- She's never acted like this before.

867
01:07:08,579 --> 01:07:10,801
- She's never been hypnotized before.
- Hypnotized?

868
01:07:10,972 --> 01:07:12,899
<i>I put a couple of
wrong ideas in her mind.</i>

869
01:07:13,066 --> 01:07:15,390
<i>I've got to get them out
while she's in the trance.</i>

870
01:07:15,560 --> 01:07:17,022
<i>Well, get them out.</i>

871
01:07:28,325 --> 01:07:31,941
Shot down like dogs.
Shot down like dogs.

872
01:07:32,115 --> 01:07:33,701
Shot down like dogs.

873
01:07:33,877 --> 01:07:35,804
The gun is empty.
What are we hiding for?

874
01:07:36,171 --> 01:07:38,393
That's right, she's
fired both shots, Tony.

875
01:07:39,762 --> 01:07:43,445
- Amanda, I wanna talk to you.
- I'm going to shoot.

876
01:07:43,650 --> 01:07:45,837
- Are you sure that gurs empty?
- Yes, yes.

877
01:07:46,011 --> 01:07:47,338
Oh, it is?

878
01:07:49,967 --> 01:07:52,789
Amanda. Wake up.

879
01:07:54,754 --> 01:07:56,272
Wake up.

880
01:07:56,582 --> 01:07:57,806
Wake up, Amanda.

881
01:07:57,979 --> 01:07:59,441
- Is she out of it?
- Yes.

882
01:07:59,607 --> 01:08:02,724
Dr. Flagg, you and Steve appear
in my chambers tomorrow morning.

883
01:08:02,899 --> 01:08:05,585
Amanda, Roland here tells me
you had a gun and went crazy.

884
01:08:05,824 --> 01:08:08,805
What are you talking about?
How did I get here? Oh, Stephen.

885
01:08:10,545 --> 01:08:13,469
- Are you sure there's no more danger?
- Yes, she's all right now.

886
01:08:13,636 --> 01:08:17,558
Oh, thank heavens, thank
heavens, thank heavens.

887
01:08:28,364 --> 01:08:30,347
There's no reason to be nervous, Tony.

888
01:08:30,524 --> 01:08:33,878
I'll explain to the judge that your
treatments have been so successful...

889
01:08:34,047 --> 01:08:36,801
...that Amanda's finally set
the date for our marriage.

890
01:08:36,974 --> 01:08:38,401
- She has?
- Tomorrow.

891
01:08:39,167 --> 01:08:41,287
I hate to hurt your feelings, Tony...

892
01:08:41,461 --> 01:08:45,349
...but Amanda's made it quite clear
that she never wants to see you again.

893
01:08:45,517 --> 01:08:48,441
She keeps mumbling something
about shooting you down like a dog.

894
01:08:48,609 --> 01:08:50,127
I can't get it out of her head.

895
01:08:51,101 --> 01:08:52,620
Steve...

896
01:08:53,961 --> 01:08:57,576
...I've got to hypnotize her again.
- What? For what?

897
01:08:57,751 --> 01:09:02,500
I put those terrible thoughts about
me into her head before I realized...

898
01:09:03,103 --> 01:09:04,792
...that I love her.

899
01:09:05,064 --> 01:09:06,390
You what?

900
01:09:06,560 --> 01:09:11,139
I'm sorry, Steve, but I didn't realize until
after she had told me that she loved me.

901
01:09:11,313 --> 01:09:13,036
She what?

902
01:09:13,208 --> 01:09:14,432
It's only fair to her...

903
01:09:14,605 --> 01:09:17,393
...for me to remove those
unnatural thoughts from her mind...

904
01:09:17,563 --> 01:09:20,182
...and then she can choose between us.

905
01:09:20,489 --> 01:09:22,711
What happens if you
don't remove the thoughts?

906
01:09:23,082 --> 01:09:25,167
She'd marry you, be unhappy...

907
01:09:25,342 --> 01:09:27,893
...and go through the
rest of her life hating me.

908
01:09:28,235 --> 01:09:29,821
You wouldn't want that to happen.

909
01:09:30,030 --> 01:09:32,217
No, I should say not.

910
01:09:32,390 --> 01:09:34,748
Amanda has to be happy.

911
01:09:38,474 --> 01:09:42,860
And as long as she loves you,
I'll just step out of the picture.

912
01:09:45,256 --> 01:09:47,012
Thanks, Steve.

913
01:09:47,683 --> 01:09:50,335
Just let me handle
everything with the judge.

914
01:09:50,508 --> 01:09:52,593
- All right.
- My Tyrollean hat.

915
01:09:52,769 --> 01:09:54,752
- Good morning, Judge Travers.
- How's Amanda?

916
01:09:54,929 --> 01:09:57,444
- She's fine.
- I didn't ask you.

917
01:09:57,622 --> 01:09:59,208
Tell him, Steve. Tell him the news.

918
01:09:59,384 --> 01:10:02,070
Before anybody tells me,
I'm gonna tell you something.

919
01:10:02,243 --> 01:10:04,793
It's because of my consideration
for Steve and Amanda...

920
01:10:04,969 --> 01:10:08,051
...that this case is not
being held in open court.

921
01:10:08,227 --> 01:10:10,811
May I suggest, then, that we
conduct it as such in here?

922
01:10:10,986 --> 01:10:12,380
Granted.

923
01:10:13,712 --> 01:10:15,401
Sit down, Tony.

924
01:10:17,535 --> 01:10:22,544
Before I begin, Your Honor, I
apologize for any lack of eloquence.

925
01:10:22,721 --> 01:10:25,044
It is with difficulty that I speak...

926
01:10:25,347 --> 01:10:29,665
...because friendships are
involved. My heart is full.

927
01:10:30,567 --> 01:10:33,921
Tony, I want you to answer
these few questions, yes or no.

928
01:10:34,090 --> 01:10:35,178
Yes.

929
01:10:35,353 --> 01:10:37,110
Isn't it true that
at a dinner party...

930
01:10:37,282 --> 01:10:39,832
...you heard my announcement
of an impending marriage?

931
01:10:40,008 --> 01:10:42,626
- Yes, but you see...
- Just answer yes or no.

932
01:10:42,833 --> 01:10:46,154
Your Honor, I am pleading for
my own happiness and Amanda's.

933
01:10:46,323 --> 01:10:49,077
<i>This man, with subtle,
scientific witchcraft...</i>

934
01:10:49,250 --> 01:10:52,140
<i>...has insidiously tried to worm
his way into the affections...</i>

935
01:10:52,307 --> 01:10:55,265
...of my sweet, simple
wife-to-be, Amanda Cooper.

936
01:10:55,433 --> 01:10:58,447
- Sit down.
- And now he has the unmitigated gall...

937
01:10:58,691 --> 01:11:02,975
<i>...to seek to get to her subconscious,
as he so aptly puts it, once more.</i>

938
01:11:03,145 --> 01:11:04,369
But I protest.

939
01:11:04,541 --> 01:11:06,898
She has suffered enough. I ask...

940
01:11:07,068 --> 01:11:10,887
No, I demand a court order
restraining this gentleman...

941
01:11:11,057 --> 01:11:14,242
...from ever seeing or even
speaking to Amanda Cooper again...

942
01:11:14,548 --> 01:11:17,132
<i>...under the extreme
penalty of the law.</i>

943
01:11:17,307 --> 01:11:18,859
Granted.

944
01:11:22,192 --> 01:11:26,408
<i>And so, my friends,
tomorrow at this same time...</i>

945
01:11:26,580 --> 01:11:29,765
...the case of Amanda Cooper
versus Stephen Arden...

946
01:11:29,937 --> 01:11:31,660
...will have been closed.

947
01:11:31,832 --> 01:11:34,689
And I shall take keen
personal delight...

948
01:11:35,023 --> 01:11:38,276
...in sentencing you
both to life imprisonment:

949
01:11:38,448 --> 01:11:40,306
Marriage.

950
01:11:41,673 --> 01:11:43,328
Sit down, Joe.

951
01:11:44,498 --> 01:11:49,145
Remind me a little later to speak
to you about those corny jokes.

952
01:11:56,732 --> 01:11:58,160
Cora?

953
01:11:58,327 --> 01:12:01,443
Joe, you know I don't
dance at your age.

954
01:12:16,578 --> 01:12:18,562
- Good evening, Judge Travers.
- Good evening.

955
01:12:18,738 --> 01:12:20,858
- Mind if I dance with Aunt Cora?
- I certainly...

956
01:12:21,033 --> 01:12:22,393
Certainly, he wouldn't.

957
01:12:28,679 --> 01:12:30,163
Amanda, may I have this dance?

958
01:12:30,340 --> 01:12:34,160
No. And if you want to get
arrested, just keep on talking.

959
01:12:34,795 --> 01:12:36,812
He's a horrible monster.

960
01:12:36,990 --> 01:12:38,645
I've got to tell her something.

961
01:12:38,818 --> 01:12:42,899
You'd better forget it for a while.
If you can't talk, you can't tell her.

962
01:12:51,716 --> 01:12:54,040
<i>Must you dance</i>

963
01:12:55,074 --> 01:12:57,589
<i>Every dance</i>

964
01:12:57,966 --> 01:13:03,316
<i>With the same fortunate man?</i>

965
01:13:03,485 --> 01:13:08,426
<i>You have danced with
him Since the music began</i>

966
01:13:09,867 --> 01:13:14,083
<i>Wort you change partners</i>

967
01:13:14,256 --> 01:13:16,545
<i>And dance with me?</i>

968
01:13:17,414 --> 01:13:19,601
<i>Must you dance</i>

969
01:13:20,206 --> 01:13:22,563
<i>Quite so close</i>

970
01:13:23,398 --> 01:13:28,544
<i>With your lips touching his face?</i>

971
01:13:29,215 --> 01:13:34,996
<i>Can't you see I'm
longing to be in his place</i>

972
01:13:35,332 --> 01:13:39,412
<i>Wort you change partners</i>

973
01:13:39,587 --> 01:13:42,046
<i>And dance with me?</i>

974
01:13:42,911 --> 01:13:47,956
<i>Ask him to sit this one
out And while you're alone</i>

975
01:13:49,227 --> 01:13:51,517
<i>I'll tell the waiter to tell him</i>

976
01:13:51,688 --> 01:13:56,132
<i>He's wanted on the telephone</i>

977
01:13:56,309 --> 01:13:58,531
<i>You've been locked</i>

978
01:13:59,134 --> 01:14:01,390
<i>In his arms</i>

979
01:14:02,092 --> 01:14:06,638
<i>Ever since heaven knows when</i>

980
01:14:06,813 --> 01:14:10,462
<i>Oh, won't you change partners</i>

981
01:14:10,637 --> 01:14:13,152
<i>And then</i>

982
01:14:13,329 --> 01:14:18,974
<i>You may never want To
change partners again</i>

983
01:14:19,512 --> 01:14:21,937
Would you mind if we went
outside for some fresh air?

984
01:14:22,105 --> 01:14:25,584
- It's awfully stuffy in here.
- Not at all, sweetheart.

985
01:14:34,406 --> 01:14:36,299
I'm sorry he upset you, dear.

986
01:14:36,466 --> 01:14:39,356
There's no reason we should
let him spoil our whole evening.

987
01:14:39,525 --> 01:14:41,281
I think he's contemptible.

988
01:14:41,453 --> 01:14:45,205
Oh, Amanda, don't say
that. Tony's all right.

989
01:14:45,708 --> 01:14:48,564
Except that he's a dirty,
double-crossing scientist.

990
01:14:48,734 --> 01:14:50,320
You're wanted on the telephone, sir.

991
01:14:50,495 --> 01:14:51,855
Just take the message, please.

992
01:14:52,024 --> 01:14:54,348
It's a long-distance call,
sir. Person-to-person.

993
01:14:54,518 --> 01:14:57,170
- Come along, Amanda.
- No, I'll meet you in the pavilion.

994
01:14:57,344 --> 01:14:59,066
I'll only be a moment.

995
01:15:11,804 --> 01:15:14,355
- Hello?
- Mr. Arden, long distance is calling.

996
01:15:14,530 --> 01:15:15,787
One moment, please.

997
01:15:15,960 --> 01:15:18,442
Go ahead with Honolulu, operator.

998
01:15:24,968 --> 01:15:26,986
This is Mr. Steve Arden, please?

999
01:15:27,163 --> 01:15:28,715
Yes, yes, who's this?

1000
01:15:28,892 --> 01:15:31,079
This is Miss Satsuma Naguchi, please.

1001
01:15:31,252 --> 01:15:34,369
- Who?
- Miss Satsuma Naguchi, please.

1002
01:15:34,543 --> 01:15:36,662
I would like information
about your marriage...

1003
01:15:36,836 --> 01:15:38,423
...to honorable lady Miss Cooper.

1004
01:15:38,599 --> 01:15:41,953
I am editor "Woman's
Column," Honolulu Daily Bugle.

1005
01:15:42,123 --> 01:15:43,947
Honolulu Daily what?

1006
01:15:44,117 --> 01:15:46,044
- Bugle.
- What?

1007
01:15:46,212 --> 01:15:48,002
Bugle, you know:

1008
01:15:52,694 --> 01:15:54,587
Amanda, may I speak to you, please?

1009
01:15:54,755 --> 01:15:57,871
- You certainly may not.
- But please, Amanda.

1010
01:17:51,273 --> 01:17:53,291
I'm awfully sorry, Miss Satsumi.

1011
01:17:53,467 --> 01:17:55,258
I don't understand
a word you're saying.

1012
01:17:55,429 --> 01:17:57,446
Not Miss Satsumi,
Miss Naguchi, please.

1013
01:17:57,623 --> 01:18:01,805
And if you do not understand, you
must be very stupid man, I think so.

1014
01:18:01,978 --> 01:18:04,562
I call you up like polite
lady to get simple information.

1015
01:18:05,136 --> 01:18:07,652
And now you make a big fuss
about nothing, I think so.

1016
01:18:07,829 --> 01:18:10,085
So I will commence with the beginning.

1017
01:18:10,255 --> 01:18:14,176
This is Miss Satsuma
Naguchi, Honolulu...

1018
01:18:23,952 --> 01:18:27,376
Amanda, I want you to repeat
after me everything I say.

1019
01:18:27,542 --> 01:18:29,060
Amanda, Amanda!

1020
01:18:29,238 --> 01:18:31,289
Dr. Flagg, stop that.
Stop that immediately.

1021
01:18:31,464 --> 01:18:34,853
Amanda. Amanda, wake up.

1022
01:18:38,679 --> 01:18:40,334
Oh, Stephen.

1023
01:18:55,200 --> 01:18:57,218
Hattie, have you ever been married?

1024
01:18:57,394 --> 01:19:00,352
- No, ma'am, but I've been engaged.
- Oh, just as good.

1025
01:19:00,520 --> 01:19:04,770
- No, ma'am, it's a lot better.
- Hattie.

1026
01:19:44,734 --> 01:19:47,692
I've opened the door for you five
times in the last 10 minutes...

1027
01:19:47,858 --> 01:19:50,409
...and Steve has caught me every time.

1028
01:19:50,617 --> 01:19:53,008
Come in through the window.
Don't let Joe see you.

1029
01:19:53,178 --> 01:19:55,297
He's issued a bench
warrant for your arrest.

1030
01:19:55,471 --> 01:19:59,654
And in case you don't know it, the
ceremony starts in five minutes.

1031
01:20:01,289 --> 01:20:03,873
- That doesn't give us much time.
- I guess it's too late.

1032
01:20:04,048 --> 01:20:06,599
After the trouble we had
getting you a marriage license?

1033
01:20:06,774 --> 01:20:09,460
But it's no good unless I can
get to her unconscious mind.

1034
01:20:09,633 --> 01:20:11,288
That'd take longer than five minutes.

1035
01:20:11,461 --> 01:20:13,546
I'd get her unconscious
in under five minutes.

1036
01:20:13,722 --> 01:20:16,374
I'd bust her in the jaw. I
guarantee she'd be unconscious.

1037
01:20:16,547 --> 01:20:17,804
Oh, don't be ridi...

1038
01:20:24,858 --> 01:20:26,615
Let's find that open window.

1039
01:20:41,746 --> 01:20:43,468
Oh, hello, Steve.

1040
01:20:43,641 --> 01:20:48,458
- We just came in through the window.
- Yeah, I guess we're in the wrong room.

1041
01:20:54,944 --> 01:20:56,496
Hi, kids.

1042
01:21:01,493 --> 01:21:03,317
Get out of here before I call Steve.

1043
01:21:03,487 --> 01:21:07,602
Amanda, darling, for what I'm
about to do, please forgive me.

1044
01:21:12,796 --> 01:21:14,756
Oh, I'm sorry, I just can't do it.

1045
01:21:14,923 --> 01:21:16,146
Hey, doc, duck!

1046
01:21:22,303 --> 01:21:23,697
Amanda, darling.

1047
01:21:23,866 --> 01:21:26,880
Hurry up, doc, get to her
unconscious before she comes to.

1048
01:21:27,323 --> 01:21:29,216
Repeat after me:

1049
01:21:29,384 --> 01:21:31,900
Tony loves Amanda.

1050
01:21:34,304 --> 01:21:37,228
Tony loves Amanda.

1051
01:21:51,291 --> 01:21:53,410
Stand up, Joe.
