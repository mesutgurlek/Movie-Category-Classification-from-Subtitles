1
00:03:47.861 --> 00:03:48.895
Mine!

2
00:03:48.895 --> 00:03:52.387
Whose pigeon?
My birds brought it down

3
00:03:53.633 --> 00:03:57.831
You have no claim on it
- l am willing to pay

4
00:03:58.104 --> 00:03:58.968
8 annas

5
00:03:59.272 --> 00:04:00.637
The price of six!

6
00:04:01.040 --> 00:04:06.501
So go, buy three for 4 annas
- 4 rupees more likely

7
00:04:06.946 --> 00:04:10.438
You made money giving
false testimony. Remember?

8
00:04:11.518 --> 00:04:13.213
l never gave any false testimony

9
00:04:15.989 --> 00:04:17.616
Wants pigeons?

10
00:04:18.057 --> 00:04:24.428
He keeps pigeon only to
trouble you. He's a real scoundrel

11
00:04:24.864 --> 00:04:28.129
lt was a bad day when you
testified against him

12
00:04:28.568 --> 00:04:32.766
He's spent 12 years in prison.
He won't forget so easily

13
00:04:34.607 --> 00:04:38.043
What made you testify
against him?

14
00:04:39.679 --> 00:04:45.982
They asked me on oath
what kind of man he was

15
00:04:47.453 --> 00:04:48.852
...so l told them

16
00:04:51.791 --> 00:04:56.490
Bring us guavas and oranges
when you return - and a doll

17
00:04:58.398 --> 00:04:59.524
l will

18
00:04:59.933 --> 00:05:03.869
Look at her, still playing with
dolls after her engagement

19
00:05:04.170 --> 00:05:05.296
Come here

20
00:05:46.245 --> 00:05:48.475
How are you, little sir?

21
00:05:49.882 --> 00:05:53.943
You got engaged, and didn't
tell your Uncle Dilawar?

22
00:05:54.721 --> 00:05:58.213
Come and get your pigeon.
Your father has paid for it

23
00:06:04.764 --> 00:06:06.322
Wait here, l'll be
right back

24
00:06:36.496 --> 00:06:38.896
This place looks all right

25
00:06:43.036 --> 00:06:46.403
You'll kill her, but
what about my money

26
00:06:46.706 --> 00:06:52.941
l thought you had other ideas
- l'll repay you

27
00:06:53.246 --> 00:06:56.306
May l say something?
- Yes?

28
00:06:57.884 --> 00:07:01.650
Let's go to Lucknow
and sell this girl

29
00:07:17.537 --> 00:07:19.129
Amiran is missing

30
00:07:19.539 --> 00:07:26.377
She was playing outside. Dilawar took
her away with an excuse about pigeons

31
00:07:26.646 --> 00:07:31.208
For God's sake, go and find
my child

32
00:08:01.848 --> 00:08:06.876
My child! Where's my child?

33
00:08:07.186 --> 00:08:09.746
l've looked everywhere

34
00:08:15.561 --> 00:08:33.003
Allah is great

35
00:09:33.039 --> 00:09:35.337
Here, eat your food

36
00:09:41.681 --> 00:09:42.739
Won't you eat?

37
00:09:44.283 --> 00:09:46.478
What's your name?
- Ramdei. Yours?

38
00:09:47.186 --> 00:09:51.782
Amiran. Did they kidnap you too?
- Yes, from that fair

39
00:09:58.364 --> 00:10:01.595
So, there are the girls?
- Salaam

40
00:10:03.736 --> 00:10:06.967
How much for this one?
- A thousand

41
00:10:09.108 --> 00:10:11.372
Has your lover ever seen
that much money?

42
00:10:11.644 --> 00:10:15.842
One thousand rupees!
Trying to con me!

43
00:10:16.148 --> 00:10:17.410
Don't be offended

44
00:10:17.717 --> 00:10:23.280
The way you talk! l've sent dozens
of girls to the palaces

45
00:10:23.522 --> 00:10:25.956
Never paid more than 500

46
00:10:26.225 --> 00:10:29.422
You name it then
- 200

47
00:10:29.962 --> 00:10:32.157
Look at her face, her hands

48
00:10:32.465 --> 00:10:36.401
Just 200, that's it

49
00:10:37.136 --> 00:10:39.127
For 200, have this one

50
00:10:40.206 --> 00:10:49.046
She's not bad either. A bit dark.
And a weak frame. 150 for her

51
00:10:51.417 --> 00:10:52.714
Agreed

52
00:10:57.456 --> 00:10:59.287
The Begum won't have
a dark girl

53
00:11:00.660 --> 00:11:05.256
l'll take the first one.
Here, 200 rupees. Count them

54
00:11:05.731 --> 00:11:06.823
Come, girl

55
00:11:18.511 --> 00:11:37.523
''Who tied the swing
to the mango tree?''

56
00:11:37.830 --> 00:11:46.101
''My lover swings...''

57
00:11:50.176 --> 00:12:06.013
''The swing tied to the
mango tree''

58
00:12:06.325 --> 00:12:15.563
''He caught my arm, embraced me''

59
00:12:18.504 --> 00:12:23.066
''Who tied the swing
to the mango tree?''

60
00:12:23.409 --> 00:12:35.219
''Who tied the swing
to the mango tree?''

61
00:12:39.425 --> 00:12:55.205
''My heart beats fast,
l'm scared''

62
00:12:55.541 --> 00:13:12.448
''Swing gently, my love''

63
00:13:41.754 --> 00:13:42.982
Come

64
00:13:47.326 --> 00:13:48.691
ls this the girl?

65
00:13:50.329 --> 00:13:51.591
Come here, my child

66
00:13:56.235 --> 00:14:01.172
How much?
- Whatever it is, we go halves

67
00:14:01.574 --> 00:14:06.068
Okay. The amount l promised is ready.
Where's the other girl?

68
00:14:06.479 --> 00:14:09.642
A lady took her for her house

69
00:14:10.049 --> 00:14:11.778
For how much?
- 400

70
00:14:12.985 --> 00:14:16.113
l'd have given that
for a good-looking girl

71
00:14:16.922 --> 00:14:18.583
This one's also good-looking

72
00:14:26.899 --> 00:14:28.196
The money-box

73
00:14:52.825 --> 00:14:57.922
Husseini, she's not expensive
at 250 rupees?

74
00:14:58.230 --> 00:15:00.790
Expensive? She's cheap

75
00:15:01.400 --> 00:15:06.838
Not so cheap either. Anyway, she
looks innocent enough

76
00:15:08.474 --> 00:15:13.207
God knows where they lift them from.
They've no fear of God

77
00:15:13.913 --> 00:15:18.941
l'm not responsible. The sin will be
on these rogues' heads

78
00:15:19.285 --> 00:15:23.244
lf not here, they'd sell
somewhere

79
00:15:23.589 --> 00:15:28.891
She's well-off here. You've heard
how the ladies treat their maids?

80
00:15:29.195 --> 00:15:31.789
Of course. The other day ...

81
00:15:32.264 --> 00:15:37.998
l heard that a lady who saw her maid
talking to her husband ...

82
00:15:38.404 --> 00:15:40.372
had her killed with
red-hot irons

83
00:15:40.773 --> 00:15:43.640
Such women will pay on the
Day of Judgment

84
00:15:45.477 --> 00:15:49.277
Give me this girl,
l'll bring her up

85
00:15:49.548 --> 00:15:53.006
She'll be yours but l'll care for her
- All right

86
00:15:54.019 --> 00:15:56.112
Where're you from?
- Bangla

87
00:15:56.488 --> 00:16:01.653
You mean you don't know this?
Faizabad is also called Bangla

88
00:16:02.595 --> 00:16:04.620
What's your name?
- Amiran

89
00:16:04.964 --> 00:16:06.431
l'm Bismillah

90
00:16:06.966 --> 00:16:10.595
l don't like that name.
l'll call you Umra

91
00:16:11.070 --> 00:16:14.233
From now on you'll answer
to Umrao

92
00:16:14.607 --> 00:16:18.099
When the lady says 'Umrao',
you say ''Yes 'm''

93
00:16:18.811 --> 00:16:21.006
Come, have a bite

94
00:16:21.880 --> 00:16:22.847
Yes'm

95
00:16:30.456 --> 00:16:32.822
What does your father do?
- He's a caretaker

96
00:16:33.259 --> 00:16:36.057
Where?
- At the tomb of Bahu Begum

97
00:16:37.529 --> 00:16:38.427
Go to sleep

98
00:17:36.755 --> 00:17:38.222
Will you see to her.

99
00:17:40.359 --> 00:17:42.725
Come. What has happened to you?

100
00:17:44.096 --> 00:17:45.154
l don't know what has happened
to her.

101
00:17:45.631 --> 00:17:47.963
She was sleeping and she woke
up all of a sudden.

102
00:17:48.334 --> 00:17:50.393
What are you trying to do?

103
00:17:50.669 --> 00:17:52.694
You were trying to run away?
Where would you run to?

104
00:17:53.105 --> 00:17:54.697
Run! Run!

105
00:17:55.040 --> 00:17:55.734
She's just a child.

106
00:17:59.511 --> 00:18:02.537
Thatis enough.

107
00:18:04.550 --> 00:18:06.108
l will break your legs if you try to
run away again.

108
00:18:06.385 --> 00:18:07.579
She won't.

109
00:18:09.188 --> 00:18:10.917
What happened? Have you gone mad?

110
00:18:11.190 --> 00:18:18.187
Where were you going? lf you had gone
out, someone would have killed you.

111
00:18:18.364 --> 00:18:20.025
There are a lot of bandits out there.

112
00:18:20.366 --> 00:18:23.529
Don't go anywhere again. This is
your home now.

113
00:18:45.190 --> 00:18:46.452
Do your salaam

114
00:18:48.994 --> 00:18:52.225
Khan Saheb will teach you
music. Will you learn?

115
00:18:52.865 --> 00:18:57.427
He's a great musician. Put your heart
in it, and all Lucknow will know you

116
00:18:57.736 --> 00:19:01.365
They'll all come to hear you sing.
You'll be known in the Court

117
00:19:01.940 --> 00:19:04.204
Not to talk of the
money and jewels

118
00:19:05.411 --> 00:19:07.345
You may begin, Khan Saheb

119
00:19:07.679 --> 00:19:08.907
Hold out your right hand

120
00:19:13.185 --> 00:19:16.154
We begin with the name of the
merciful Allah

121
00:19:19.625 --> 00:19:20.922
Now sing with me

122
00:24:53.091 --> 00:25:09.531
Here mindlessness does not refer to
lack of intelligence or knowledge

123
00:25:09.941 --> 00:25:22.183
This mindlessness is an ultimate bliss,
of love, when everything ceases

124
00:25:22.387 --> 00:25:29.020
Neither the desire
nor its object remained

125
00:25:29.661 --> 00:25:35.190
That is, neither the lover nor the
beloved remains, not even love itself

126
00:25:36.067 --> 00:25:43.303
Only a state of mind which
the poet calls mindlessness

127
00:25:43.608 --> 00:25:48.068
And this mindlessness is
the beauty of the couplet

128
00:25:48.380 --> 00:25:55.479
Wonderful, sir, sometimes l too
feel like composing poetry

129
00:25:55.821 --> 00:26:01.123
Go ahead. There's no better way of
expressing one's feelings

130
00:26:01.426 --> 00:26:06.193
Will you help with suggestions?
- But certainly!

131
00:26:17.275 --> 00:26:20.608
Khanum is calling you
- Nothing wrong, l hope?

132
00:26:21.046 --> 00:26:22.308
You'll have to ask her

133
00:26:32.157 --> 00:26:35.615
Ma'am, did you call me?
- No. Who said l did?

134
00:26:35.994 --> 00:26:37.154
Gohar Mirza

135
00:26:38.663 --> 00:26:43.566
l haven't seen that rogue for two
days. l sent him to buy something

136
00:26:43.768 --> 00:26:45.793
Must've spent the money!

137
00:26:46.137 --> 00:26:48.367
Tell that rascal to see me

138
00:26:53.411 --> 00:26:55.709
Gohar Mirza! This was an offering

139
00:26:56.748 --> 00:26:58.215
Great!

140
00:26:59.684 --> 00:27:01.982
Umrao, you make it better
than even Aunt Husseini

141
00:27:02.420 --> 00:27:03.751
lt should be sweeter

142
00:27:04.222 --> 00:27:07.157
You're shameless, telling lies
to get food

143
00:27:07.459 --> 00:27:09.154
lt was meant for the shrine

144
00:27:09.561 --> 00:27:12.689
Someone would've
eaten it anyway

145
00:27:14.432 --> 00:27:19.335
l hope to God you die of
cholera. Die right now

146
00:27:58.710 --> 00:28:00.302
Show me those
ornate earrings

147
00:28:02.714 --> 00:28:03.738
Aren't they beautiful?

148
00:28:05.951 --> 00:28:10.820
Where is the matching front piece?
- lt isn't ready yet

149
00:28:11.156 --> 00:28:13.989
Send it today. We need it in two days
- Very well

150
00:28:15.593 --> 00:28:20.326
Where is the banat from Delhi?
- lt's in the box

151
00:28:20.865 --> 00:28:24.096
Are you saving it for
Maulvi Saheb's cap? Get it, quick

152
00:28:26.805 --> 00:28:30.639
Khanum Saheba, your jokes
are priceless

153
00:28:31.042 --> 00:28:34.136
My feet are killing me.
Do this, do that

154
00:28:34.446 --> 00:28:37.176
Such a big gathering and only
me to do all the work

155
00:28:39.017 --> 00:28:40.541
What are you doing here?

156
00:28:41.086 --> 00:28:47.184
You'd forgotten about me. l was
very hungry, so l thought...

157
00:28:47.559 --> 00:28:49.459
Couldn't you have waited
a little?

158
00:28:49.995 --> 00:28:53.931
Why should you, l'm not your
lawful wedded wife

159
00:28:55.066 --> 00:28:57.967
Stop being angry
at small things

160
00:28:58.403 --> 00:29:00.098
Here, eat
- No

161
00:29:00.939 --> 00:29:04.636
On your life, please sit

162
00:29:04.976 --> 00:29:06.807
You're really good at
persuasion

163
00:29:12.751 --> 00:29:15.151
Not only my heart, take...

164
00:29:16.354 --> 00:29:17.685
Someone's there

165
00:29:28.466 --> 00:29:33.403
Another poem? Great going,
Read

166
00:29:37.208 --> 00:29:41.440
''Not only my heart, Sir,
take my life''

167
00:29:42.414 --> 00:29:46.714
'' But do as l ask just once''

168
00:29:47.752 --> 00:29:55.591
Not bad, but remember
two things

169
00:29:56.594 --> 00:29:59.563
The delicacy of the thought...

170
00:30:00.398 --> 00:30:03.526
And the rhythm of the words

171
00:30:05.570 --> 00:30:12.169
Listen to the poet Mir...

172
00:30:12.577 --> 00:30:18.812
''How do l describe the softness of
her lips? They are like rose petals''

173
00:30:21.386 --> 00:30:24.253
You are talking
of great poets

174
00:30:25.256 --> 00:30:27.349
She is just a beginner

175
00:30:28.293 --> 00:30:30.693
What do you say, sir?

176
00:30:33.665 --> 00:30:39.262
You say, 'Not only my heart...'

177
00:30:43.208 --> 00:30:44.641
You could say instead...

178
00:30:45.009 --> 00:30:53.940
What is my heart? You take my life.
But do as l ask just once

179
00:31:17.308 --> 00:31:28.583
''What is my heart?
You take my life''

180
00:31:33.391 --> 00:31:44.427
''What is my heart?
You take my life''

181
00:31:45.904 --> 00:32:00.217
'' But do as l ask just once''

182
00:32:00.351 --> 00:32:08.122
'' But do as l ask just once''

183
00:32:08.426 --> 00:32:15.832
''What is my heart?
You take my life''

184
00:33:07.485 --> 00:33:23.698
''You'll come here
again and again''

185
00:33:25.069 --> 00:33:36.571
''Carefully observe this place''

186
00:33:36.881 --> 00:33:43.616
''Carefully observe this place''

187
00:33:43.921 --> 00:33:51.953
''What is my heart?
You should come to know.

188
00:34:13.618 --> 00:34:37.738
''l know that friends
get estranged''

189
00:34:39.077 --> 00:34:51.012
'' But why be obliged
to strangers?''

190
00:34:51.089 --> 00:34:58.162
'' But why be obliged
to strangers?''

191
00:34:58.162 --> 00:35:05.125
''What is my heart?
You take my life''

192
00:35:38.269 --> 00:36:04.187
''lf you say, l'll bring
the sky down''

193
00:36:05.229 --> 00:36:16.834
''Nothing is difficult
if you make up your mind''

194
00:36:16.974 --> 00:36:24.039
''Nothing is difficult
if you make up your mind''

195
00:36:24.315 --> 00:36:31.221
''What is my heart?
You take my life''

196
00:36:31.756 --> 00:36:45.602
'' But do as l ask just once''

197
00:36:46.170 --> 00:36:53.838
''Please accept...''

198
00:37:02.036 --> 00:37:04.527
Here
- You put it on me

199
00:37:11.546 --> 00:37:14.572
Like it?
- Very much

200
00:37:33.268 --> 00:37:39.867
Why look in the mirror?
Your image is in my eyes

201
00:37:43.044 --> 00:37:44.136
For me?

202
00:37:48.550 --> 00:37:51.986
Let's see you put it on

203
00:37:55.590 --> 00:37:56.921
You put it on me

204
00:38:33.027 --> 00:38:37.396
You bastard, you pick on my
girls to show your manhood

205
00:38:37.765 --> 00:38:39.357
l picked you from the gutter

206
00:38:39.634 --> 00:38:44.367
l gave you shelter, food,
clothes, money and...

207
00:38:44.606 --> 00:38:48.940
l swear, l never looked at anyone
before, Umrao herself called me

208
00:38:49.277 --> 00:38:53.543
Trying to fool me! Get out of here.
l don't want to see your face again

209
00:38:53.848 --> 00:38:58.547
lf you come here, l'll have your legs
broken. Now get out

210
00:39:02.790 --> 00:39:05.122
Are you all right?
- Yes, by God's grace

211
00:39:08.663 --> 00:39:11.632
Come in, Nawab Saheb

212
00:39:22.277 --> 00:39:24.643
Has Bismillah gone out?

213
00:39:25.513 --> 00:39:29.540
An admirer should be like you,
still asking after her

214
00:39:31.052 --> 00:39:32.280
Have some betel leaf

215
00:39:37.125 --> 00:39:42.062
You know, Khanum, strange are
the ways of heart

216
00:39:44.632 --> 00:39:46.964
You don't like
Malka or Bahar?

217
00:39:47.268 --> 00:39:48.667
Well, l...

218
00:39:49.237 --> 00:39:53.571
What do you think of Umrao?
What are you saying?

219
00:39:53.942 --> 00:39:56.536
She's at your service,
if you wish

220
00:39:57.111 --> 00:39:59.011
Do l take it as settled?

221
00:39:59.314 --> 00:40:05.014
Sure. Just arrange for the money.
lt'll be at least 5,000

222
00:40:05.320 --> 00:40:09.313
5000 !
- lt's a question

223
00:40:10.358 --> 00:40:12.553
lt'll take some time

224
00:40:12.827 --> 00:40:15.853
Think about it. l have
several offers

225
00:40:16.230 --> 00:40:17.857
l'll go to my estate

226
00:40:19.867 --> 00:40:32.769
ln every way l was done down. My
enemy's name written with my blood

227
00:40:58.239 --> 00:41:11.710
What is this heart, you may take
my life. But do as l ask just once

228
00:41:15.189 --> 00:41:20.752
You'll come here
again and again

229
00:41:21.029 --> 00:41:24.226
Carefully observe this place.

230
00:41:32.874 --> 00:41:37.311
You're sure this is
your composition?

231
00:41:44.652 --> 00:41:47.519
lf my life be spared,
may l speak

232
00:41:48.122 --> 00:41:49.521
Yes?

233
00:41:52.093 --> 00:41:56.860
The ghazal was written
by Umrao Jaan

234
00:41:58.566 --> 00:42:00.363
Umrao Jaan?
- Yes

235
00:42:01.369 --> 00:42:03.360
l've never heard this name before

236
00:42:09.610 --> 00:42:13.171
Praising Umrao Jaan is like
holding a candle to the sun

237
00:42:14.615 --> 00:42:20.110
She's so beautiful even the
Fairy Queen would envy her

238
00:42:21.389 --> 00:42:24.756
Her verses make great poets
admit defeat

239
00:42:25.560 --> 00:42:27.687
And her voice!

240
00:42:30.798 --> 00:42:35.258
Her voice is like a
leaping flame

241
00:43:00.728 --> 00:43:02.127
That's her.

242
00:43:35.696 --> 00:44:03.252
''Thousands are intoxicated
by these eyes''

243
00:44:03.591 --> 00:44:20.964
''Associated with these eyes
are a thousand tales''

244
00:44:21.442 --> 00:44:25.378
''The intoxication of these eyes...''

245
00:44:45.132 --> 00:45:07.079
''You are not the only one
disgraced for love of me''

246
00:45:07.455 --> 00:45:24.999
''ln this city, there are
thousands like you''

247
00:45:25.740 --> 00:45:38.175
''Thousands are intoxicated
by these eyes''

248
00:46:08.916 --> 00:46:33.196
''l'm the only one who
intoxicates with my eyes''

249
00:46:33.607 --> 00:46:50.889
''Though there thousands
of taverns in the world''

250
00:46:51.592 --> 00:47:04.562
''Thousands are intoxicated
by these eyes''

251
00:47:28.362 --> 00:47:49.979
''You think a gale can scare
such a flame''

252
00:47:50.351 --> 00:48:07.429
''A flame which is protected
by a thousand moths''

253
00:48:07.768 --> 00:48:16.267
''Thousands are intoxicated
by these eyes''

254
00:48:16.644 --> 00:48:29.614
''Associated with these eyes
are a thousand tales''

255
00:48:29.924 --> 00:48:34.418
''The intoxication of these eyes...''

256
00:49:10.302 --> 00:49:11.564
Twenty-five

257
00:49:13.438 --> 00:49:14.871
Look at Bismillah!

258
00:49:16.742 --> 00:49:18.039
25 again

259
00:49:18.944 --> 00:49:20.502
Watch the fun now

260
00:49:25.017 --> 00:49:26.507
Three!

261
00:49:31.156 --> 00:49:32.714
l keep losing. l won't play any more

262
00:49:39.097 --> 00:49:41.531
Spread the board, l'll play

263
00:49:47.806 --> 00:49:49.398
Has Khanum forgiven you?

264
00:49:49.741 --> 00:49:54.269
Of course. l'm the support
of her old age

265
00:49:58.083 --> 00:50:00.313
Are you angry with me?
- No

266
00:50:02.254 --> 00:50:05.246
Then give me your hand
- Why?

267
00:50:09.161 --> 00:50:11.356
Five mohurs of gold

268
00:50:12.865 --> 00:50:18.030
Advance for a performance?
- Nawab Sultan sent 10, l've kept 5

269
00:50:18.337 --> 00:50:20.965
Who is Nawab Sultan?

270
00:50:21.406 --> 00:50:23.931
The one who gave you
the necklace

271
00:50:27.246 --> 00:50:30.579
There's talk of his
retaining you

272
00:50:30.983 --> 00:50:33.850
And he's asked for the ghazal
which you sang yesterday

273
00:50:34.686 --> 00:50:37.621
l'll give it to him
when he comes here

274
00:50:38.824 --> 00:50:42.021
All right, give it to him

275
00:50:43.428 --> 00:50:48.730
lf you'd sent it through me, l'd
have earned some more gold

276
00:50:50.235 --> 00:50:53.830
Hide these
- Why? l have to give them to Khanum

277
00:50:54.306 --> 00:50:57.867
You don't have to tell her.
Neither will l

278
00:50:58.543 --> 00:50:59.771
l'll go and meet Khanum

279
00:51:48.994 --> 00:51:52.395
Please come in

280
00:52:21.994 --> 00:52:24.360
l rarely visit bordellos

281
00:52:25.330 --> 00:52:27.525
We are not such bad people

282
00:52:28.400 --> 00:52:32.234
l've come because of you alone

283
00:52:33.472 --> 00:52:37.704
l know you're saying this
just to please me

284
00:52:38.477 --> 00:52:46.248
No. l haven't got over the
spell you cast that evening

285
00:52:46.651 --> 00:52:50.985
l felt as though you were
singing for me alone

286
00:52:51.289 --> 00:52:57.558
Whom else? Who else understood
music and poetry as well as you

287
00:53:00.032 --> 00:53:02.159
l was so lost in the music
that l forgot to applaud

288
00:53:04.236 --> 00:53:08.366
There can be no
greater applause than that

289
00:53:11.443 --> 00:53:17.848
The ghazal was written by you?
- lt's nothing, just doggerel

290
00:53:18.250 --> 00:53:22.346
Such a beautiful poem;
don't call it doggerel

291
00:53:25.824 --> 00:53:28.258
You too write poetry

292
00:53:29.561 --> 00:53:35.864
Poetry is beyond one. Sometimes
when l am alone l may hum a tune

293
00:53:36.101 --> 00:53:39.332
We are alone here, hum something

294
00:53:39.671 --> 00:53:41.298
Before you l am dumb

295
00:53:42.307 --> 00:53:44.172
Oh, come on

296
00:53:45.343 --> 00:53:49.780
On one condition
- l agree

297
00:53:50.816 --> 00:53:53.284
Give me a copy of that ghazal

298
00:53:53.785 --> 00:53:57.551
What a thing to ask for

299
00:54:02.160 --> 00:54:04.594
Don't make me suffer,
let me hear it

300
00:54:09.034 --> 00:54:10.296
A few couplets

301
00:54:13.071 --> 00:54:19.943
''ln every way l was done down
My enemy's name written with my blood''

302
00:54:21.179 --> 00:54:25.741
''Why couldn't talk of her
make me happy today?''

303
00:54:26.251 --> 00:54:29.812
''Why couldn't talk of her
make me happy today?''

304
00:54:30.222 --> 00:54:33.350
''Why did her name make
my heart heavy today?''

305
00:54:33.625 --> 00:54:36.526
Wonderful!

306
00:54:41.133 --> 00:54:42.225
What's this?

307
00:54:43.635 --> 00:54:48.572
These couplets deserve
not one, but all of my poems

308
00:54:49.574 --> 00:54:52.270
You embarrass me

309
00:54:52.577 --> 00:54:59.073
l and my poetry are embarrassed
We're not worthy of you

310
00:55:00.819 --> 00:55:05.017
''Why couldn't talk of her
make me happy today?''

311
00:55:05.790 --> 00:55:09.487
''Why did her name make
my heart heavy today?''

312
00:55:10.362 --> 00:55:13.695
What a beautiful thought

313
00:55:13.965 --> 00:55:17.401
l wrote it for a
poet's meeting in Faizabad

314
00:55:18.570 --> 00:55:19.969
Faizabad?

315
00:55:20.906 --> 00:55:23.636
Yes, that's where my grandmother's
house is

316
00:55:23.975 --> 00:55:29.003
You come from Faizabad?
- Yes. Have you ever been there?

317
00:55:33.451 --> 00:55:37.888
Let it be. l don't remember
anything now

318
00:55:39.391 --> 00:55:41.882
lf you remember nothing, why are
your eyes moist?

319
00:55:44.429 --> 00:55:51.426
My eyes smert at times...
sometimes the light hurts them

320
00:55:54.940 --> 00:55:59.274
lf l can be of any help...

321
00:56:01.012 --> 00:56:08.350
Nawab Saheb, don't take it so
seriously

322
00:56:08.887 --> 00:56:11.481
Have a betel leaf

323
00:56:28.206 --> 00:56:29.605
Look, Bismillah

324
00:56:31.243 --> 00:56:34.041
Aren't they nice?

325
00:56:38.049 --> 00:56:41.109
The gentleman sitting with Umrao...

326
00:56:41.453 --> 00:56:46.015
This is a bordello, all sorts of
people come here. Why?

327
00:56:46.491 --> 00:56:47.856
Please come this way

328
00:56:53.732 --> 00:56:56.462
My honor is in your hands now

329
00:56:57.702 --> 00:57:01.103
Sultan must not learn
that l come here

330
00:57:01.373 --> 00:57:06.470
Nawab Saheb? What are you saying?
What do you have to do with him?

331
00:57:06.845 --> 00:57:09.507
Sultan is my son

332
00:57:11.249 --> 00:57:14.980
His mother and l are separated,
but...

333
00:57:15.420 --> 00:57:17.513
Rest assured, Nawab Saheb

334
00:57:19.557 --> 00:57:25.018
l'd brought this for Umrao,
you keep it now

335
00:57:30.802 --> 00:57:36.502
ln just a month you've driven me
mad, l can't rest without seeing you

336
00:57:40.512 --> 00:57:42.070
What can l say?

337
00:57:46.017 --> 00:57:46.915
Why?

338
00:57:50.522 --> 00:57:58.452
Now you're here l remember nothing.
But there was something l had to say

339
00:58:01.533 --> 00:58:03.660
l know what you had to say

340
00:58:35.433 --> 00:58:41.497
Me, You, And this solitude

341
00:58:45.377 --> 00:58:49.780
Listen, l've composed a tune for you
- Not now.

342
00:58:51.449 --> 00:58:52.916
Do listen

343
00:58:54.586 --> 00:59:01.651
l'm listening. Hair like
rain clouds, eyes like doe's...

344
00:59:03.194 --> 00:59:08.928
... lips like rose petals,
neck like an amphora

345
00:59:10.101 --> 00:59:11.591
This is your poem

346
00:59:12.036 --> 00:59:16.200
l won't talk to you.
Are my poems that bad?

347
00:59:16.808 --> 00:59:19.800
All right, don't be angry.
l'll listen

348
00:59:31.956 --> 00:59:37.394
Go ahead, sing, why did you stop?
l'm no outsider

349
00:59:37.662 --> 00:59:40.460
Who are you?
- l've come to hear you sing

350
00:59:41.966 --> 00:59:43.297
Sing

351
00:59:44.169 --> 00:59:45.568
What's the matter, Umrao?

352
00:59:46.938 --> 00:59:50.806
Khan Saheb, please step this way
- Why?

353
00:59:51.109 --> 00:59:53.907
l've something to say
- Say it from there

354
00:59:54.712 --> 00:59:59.149
l'm not getting up from here
- You force yourself on us?

355
00:59:59.417 --> 01:00:02.682
Who's forcing anybody?
A bordello is open to all

356
01:00:03.188 --> 01:00:06.248
No bastard has any
special rights

357
01:00:06.491 --> 01:00:09.688
Whoever produces cash
gets the girl

358
01:00:09.961 --> 01:00:12.327
l'm ready to spend

359
01:00:12.697 --> 01:00:15.291
Visit us some other time

360
01:00:15.567 --> 01:00:20.800
Shut up, woman. l've told you
l'm not leaving this place

361
01:00:21.139 --> 01:00:23.300
Child, you come here

362
01:00:26.911 --> 01:00:28.242
Please let go her hand

363
01:00:29.681 --> 01:00:34.414
No pimp dare make me let go

364
01:00:34.686 --> 01:00:38.349
Mind your tongue; perhaps you
don't know how decent folk behave

365
01:00:41.326 --> 01:00:47.356
You've been with a lot of
decent folk. Do what you can

366
01:00:47.665 --> 01:00:52.125
But for the honor of my family,
l'd have taught you a lesson

367
01:00:52.604 --> 01:00:56.472
You visit whores, and you're
afraid of mother?

368
01:00:57.175 --> 01:00:58.335
Call Macca Pasi

369
01:01:00.845 --> 01:01:05.714
Don't rely on servants
See this sword?

370
01:01:05.917 --> 01:01:10.445
This is not a fence-ring. lf you
want a fight, come outside

371
01:01:11.389 --> 01:01:16.292
Little boy, you're still
kissable

372
01:01:16.628 --> 01:01:21.725
lf you fight with a grown man,
you'll cop it and make mother cry

373
01:01:34.712 --> 01:01:36.703
Go home, sir. l'll manage
things

374
01:01:37.649 --> 01:01:42.177
l won't go
- You'll get a bad name. Go home

375
01:01:42.720 --> 01:01:45.848
Go, or you'll get into
a murder case

376
01:01:46.124 --> 01:01:47.113
l said l won't go

377
01:01:48.560 --> 01:01:52.189
He's still alive
- Such bastards don't die easily

378
01:01:52.530 --> 01:01:54.430
l implore you. Go away
from here

379
01:02:04.809 --> 01:02:09.439
Pick him up and throw him
in the gutter. We'll see later

380
01:02:29.434 --> 01:02:35.532
She sits in mourning
with her hair open ...

381
01:02:35.840 --> 01:02:40.436
My desires joined in the condolence

382
01:02:40.778 --> 01:02:45.647
Don't tease the girl. She's not well

383
01:02:46.017 --> 01:02:50.613
She's not ill, just pining away for
Nawab Sultan

384
01:02:51.222 --> 01:02:54.316
And he's hiding his head
in mother's lap

385
01:02:54.659 --> 01:02:58.720
l know, there's no true love
these days

386
01:03:00.031 --> 01:03:04.468
God help me, but in our days
there were lovers

387
01:03:05.036 --> 01:03:09.370
Either you possess someone
or you make someone yours

388
01:03:10.441 --> 01:03:16.380
Take our Maulvi Saheb.
He'd come to show me his nuptial suit

389
01:03:16.714 --> 01:03:22.812
l took his hand and made him sit
down. 40 years later, he's still here

390
01:03:25.556 --> 01:03:28.457
lf you wish l can get hold
of a lover of those days...

391
01:03:30.261 --> 01:03:36.791
Bald, toothless, but
he's lord of 40 villages

392
01:03:37.335 --> 01:03:39.394
Name - Nawab Jafar

393
01:03:40.672 --> 01:03:43.470
Take a note
- To whom? Nawab Jafar?

394
01:03:44.409 --> 01:03:45.637
No - him

395
01:03:54.585 --> 01:03:58.578
''To love me or not is in your power''

396
01:03:59.023 --> 01:04:03.756
'' But for me not to love you
is beyond my power''

397
01:04:09.267 --> 01:04:10.791
Please take this reply

398
01:04:24.415 --> 01:04:28.511
Your letter has rekindled
the fire that was buried

399
01:04:29.020 --> 01:04:33.855
l'm held to my word. l'll never
come to your house again

400
01:04:35.359 --> 01:04:38.760
My friend Banna Saheb
lives in Nawabganj

401
01:04:39.030 --> 01:04:41.726
Come there this evening
if you have time

402
01:07:04.709 --> 01:07:08.372
The Nawab will be a bit late.
The lady is calling you

403
01:07:08.579 --> 01:07:10.740
Who, Banna Saheb's wife?

404
01:07:11.082 --> 01:07:12.049
Yes'm

405
01:07:28.499 --> 01:07:33.027
My husband has been at Nawab
Sultan's place since morning

406
01:07:35.973 --> 01:07:39.875
l think his mother
is not well

407
01:07:40.511 --> 01:07:42.411
Ma'am, who's this?

408
01:07:43.047 --> 01:07:46.676
What's it to you?
As if l don't know

409
01:07:46.984 --> 01:07:51.421
Everyone knows her
- so why do you ask?

410
01:07:51.722 --> 01:07:58.321
Who's talking to you?
l was asking our lady

411
01:07:58.663 --> 01:08:04.533
How can l dare to talk
to you, you're high society

412
01:08:05.269 --> 01:08:10.002
lf you want to show your
coarseness, go to the elder Begum

413
01:08:10.374 --> 01:08:16.438
Yes, you're right, with her here
l'm not needed

414
01:08:16.647 --> 01:08:22.586
Will you go before l hit you?
- Let her go, she's just silly

415
01:08:22.820 --> 01:08:27.757
You shut up, you whore
or l'll strangle you

416
01:08:28.025 --> 01:08:30.926
Mean, low-born...

417
01:08:31.195 --> 01:08:34.631
Let her go, she's old

418
01:08:34.932 --> 01:08:36.797
What's up?

419
01:08:37.268 --> 01:08:41.432
This whore made me get a beating
- You dare again!

420
01:08:41.706 --> 01:08:43.833
Why did you pick on her?

421
01:08:44.141 --> 01:08:48.441
l swear l said nothing. Seems she's
got up on the wrong side of the bed

422
01:08:48.746 --> 01:08:50.907
Such rude things she said

423
01:08:51.349 --> 01:08:58.778
You gave her beating for nothing,
child, for this loose woman

424
01:08:59.290 --> 01:09:04.455
That's why l was saying
one can't trust whores

425
01:09:04.729 --> 01:09:07.163
Even their shadows
should be avoided

426
01:09:14.839 --> 01:09:17.307
lf you want to meet me,
come to our house

427
01:09:19.643 --> 01:09:21.838
You know l can't go there

428
01:09:24.548 --> 01:09:26.379
And l can't come here

429
01:09:41.298 --> 01:09:47.498
Come in, Panna Mal. You went for
two days and stayed away for 15

430
01:09:47.805 --> 01:09:49.864
Haven't you heard?
- What?

431
01:09:50.274 --> 01:09:56.679
l'm ruined. My house was burgled.
l've lost the wealth of generations

432
01:09:56.914 --> 01:09:58.176
How much is the loss?

433
01:09:58.449 --> 01:10:03.148
There is nothing left. The jewellery
is worth 200,000

434
01:10:03.454 --> 01:10:11.054
ls my jewellery gone?
- Mercifully, no. lt was in the shop

435
01:10:11.362 --> 01:10:17.164
Thank God. So many burglaries
in the city these days

436
01:10:18.469 --> 01:10:24.032
Yours is the third one
in a row

437
01:10:25.009 --> 01:10:27.273
The police chief doesn't know
what to do

438
01:10:27.611 --> 01:10:34.016
Known thieves of the city were
questioned. They deny any hand in it

439
01:10:34.285 --> 01:10:38.984
l hear its an outsider,
an outlaw named Faiz Ali

440
01:10:39.457 --> 01:10:41.687
There's a lady come to
meet you...

441
01:10:43.961 --> 01:10:45.724
Show her in

442
01:10:46.464 --> 01:10:47.897
The curtains

443
01:10:48.365 --> 01:10:51.459
Girls, take him to your rooms

444
01:10:51.836 --> 01:10:55.966
Me, with them, to their rooms...
What luck!

445
01:11:08.018 --> 01:11:09.383
Where are you from?

446
01:11:12.756 --> 01:11:14.155
l hope there's no one else here

447
01:11:14.492 --> 01:11:17.393
No one. Just you,
me and them...

448
01:11:17.928 --> 01:11:21.887
l'm Fakhrunnisa
- Chabban's mother

449
01:11:22.266 --> 01:11:25.997
You are Bismillah's mother?
- Yes. Go on, please

450
01:11:26.270 --> 01:11:31.037
Chabban is my only son,
brought up with great love

451
01:11:31.408 --> 01:11:40.510
He's engaged to his cousin,
but he refuses to marry her

452
01:11:41.010 --> 01:11:47.142
His uncle has disinherited
him because of it

453
01:11:47.416 --> 01:11:53.377
Do me a favor. Get Chabban
to agree to this marriage

454
01:11:53.789 --> 01:12:00.661
Your daughter has a home for life.
l'll give more than Chabban paid her

455
01:12:00.997 --> 01:12:04.990
Save my home from
being wrecked

456
01:12:07.036 --> 01:12:11.973
l'm your slave. God willing,
it will be as you say

457
01:12:12.241 --> 01:12:14.641
But Chabban must not
know of this

458
01:12:16.779 --> 01:12:20.442
There was no need for this.
We are your servants

459
01:12:20.816 --> 01:12:24.479
Now l'll ask for your leave
- God be with you

460
01:12:27.557 --> 01:12:31.823
How are you?
- Well, by God's grace

461
01:12:32.094 --> 01:12:34.528
We pray for your well being

462
01:12:34.830 --> 01:12:39.927
No matter how well we do, we still
look to you for support

463
01:12:41.337 --> 01:12:46.969
This time l have a request,
lf you permit...

464
01:12:47.276 --> 01:12:48.368
Command me

465
01:12:56.352 --> 01:13:00.721
They brought this shawl for
sale. The trader wants 2,000

466
01:13:01.190 --> 01:13:05.183
l think it's not
too expensive at 1700 or 1800

467
01:13:05.661 --> 01:13:11.691
lf you are generous, l'll wear
a shawl in my old age

468
01:13:14.036 --> 01:13:15.867
You keep out of this

469
01:13:16.205 --> 01:13:20.608
You ask him for so many
things. Let me ask today

470
01:13:20.943 --> 01:13:27.872
Nawab Saheb, has the cat caught
your tongue? Say something

471
01:13:28.184 --> 01:13:30.675
lf not yes, at least say no

472
01:13:31.220 --> 01:13:35.316
This shawl is of
no consequence

473
01:13:35.725 --> 01:13:39.286
Perhaps you are unaware
of my condition

474
01:13:39.629 --> 01:13:41.494
Nothing wrong, l hope

475
01:13:41.764 --> 01:13:45.291
l'll no longer accede
to your requests

476
01:13:45.801 --> 01:13:52.172
We're so low that rich men like you
are miserly about little things

477
01:13:52.375 --> 01:13:53.967
lt's the truth

478
01:13:56.979 --> 01:14:01.814
lf you can't any longer,
why visit us?

479
01:14:02.151 --> 01:14:06.850
You know very well that a
courtesan is a rich man's friend

480
01:14:07.156 --> 01:14:08.953
Courtesy won't fill our bellies

481
01:14:09.325 --> 01:14:17.164
This is your home, come when
you please. But think of your honor

482
01:14:19.068 --> 01:14:24.335
l've really made a mistake
l'll never come again

483
01:14:24.774 --> 01:14:28.437
You're angry. l won't
let you go

484
01:14:29.011 --> 01:14:32.811
Want me to be insulted again
by your mother?

485
01:14:59.008 --> 01:15:05.106
''The eyes have raised so many storms.
The boat of memories doesn't sink''

486
01:15:05.414 --> 01:15:10.044
''l see no way of meeting you,
getting you again''

487
01:15:10.519 --> 01:15:15.422
What are you writing? A love-letter
to Nawab Sultan?

488
01:15:15.725 --> 01:15:17.488
Can't l write anything else?

489
01:15:17.860 --> 01:15:23.492
You can't even think of it.
You're dedicated to Sultan

490
01:15:23.899 --> 01:15:29.269
l'm afraid you'll go
to his house one day

491
01:15:29.805 --> 01:15:34.833
You seem chirpy. You've got
over grieving for Chabban

492
01:15:35.211 --> 01:15:42.174
Don't talk of him. Whenever
he is mentioned, l hate the world

493
01:15:42.785 --> 01:15:48.553
Especially Mother
- What has she done?

494
01:15:48.858 --> 01:15:52.954
She's responsible
for Chabban's death

495
01:15:53.295 --> 01:15:57.595
lf she hadn't taunted him,
he wouldn't have died

496
01:15:57.900 --> 01:16:00.892
Bismillah, you're
completely changed

497
01:16:01.237 --> 01:16:05.264
You used to say a whore is
respected only in her house

498
01:16:05.608 --> 01:16:08.839
Outside, she's nothing. And now -

499
01:16:09.011 --> 01:16:12.811
After Chabban l don't like anything

500
01:16:13.182 --> 01:16:18.848
l feel, if l find someone, l'll
just hold his hand for ever

501
01:16:19.121 --> 01:16:24.821
You're a strange one. And you
object to my ways!

502
01:16:25.094 --> 01:16:30.122
Don't compare Sultan with Chabban

503
01:16:30.533 --> 01:16:37.462
Chabban could give up his life.
Sultan doesn't even dare meet you

504
01:16:37.907 --> 01:16:41.741
He wants to. l don't let him

505
01:16:42.077 --> 01:16:46.810
That's what you say. l'll ask
you when he betrays you

506
01:16:56.025 --> 01:17:02.430
For your sake, l've worn out
both my feet and tongue

507
01:17:02.698 --> 01:17:04.063
Oh God! What have l done?

508
01:17:04.500 --> 01:17:12.908
Not you, me. My feet ache from
making trips to Sultans house

509
01:17:13.209 --> 01:17:16.372
He was tending, his sick mother

510
01:17:16.979 --> 01:17:25.478
When l finally met him, my tongue
wore out talking of your passion

511
01:17:29.358 --> 01:17:34.386
''What has this heart not done
for love of you''

512
01:17:34.663 --> 01:17:35.994
What did he say?

513
01:17:36.365 --> 01:17:38.663
What could he say?

514
01:17:39.034 --> 01:17:46.440
''Mention of that green fairy...
And then my description''

515
01:17:46.775 --> 01:17:53.010
He started begging ''Arrange
a meeting with Umrao, somehow''

516
01:17:53.515 --> 01:17:56.177
l'll never meet him
at Banne Saheb's

517
01:17:56.518 --> 01:17:58.509
He'll come to meet you in Musabagh

518
01:17:58.821 --> 01:18:04.282
Musabagh? But that's outside town.
Khanum won't let me go that far

519
01:18:05.794 --> 01:18:13.223
For just five rupees
l'll arrange everything

520
01:18:13.435 --> 01:18:14.959
l'll give it. Tell me

521
01:18:15.304 --> 01:18:16.828
Khanum herself will take you

522
01:18:18.274 --> 01:18:20.504
Wait and see

523
01:18:43.799 --> 01:18:45.130
The saffron?

524
01:18:45.401 --> 01:18:49.599
Oh God, l forgot!
- What do we put in the 'pulao' then?

525
01:18:49.872 --> 01:18:56.402
lt's because of him. His betel leaf,
his tobacco, his hookah...

526
01:18:57.246 --> 01:19:00.841
The carriage is waiting. l'll get it
- Forget it, you'll be gone all day

527
01:19:01.450 --> 01:19:06.444
Looks as if he's never eaten.
Get out of there

528
01:19:08.290 --> 01:19:10.815
Hurry up
- lt's ready

529
01:19:44.226 --> 01:19:51.997
l haven't seen you all these days.
l kept worrying; thinking

530
01:20:13.188 --> 01:20:26.898
''Whenever life brings me
to your side''

531
01:20:28.704 --> 01:20:38.909
''Whenever life brings me
to your side''

532
01:20:39.281 --> 01:20:49.122
''... the earth seems fairer
than the moon''

533
01:20:49.591 --> 01:20:59.193
''... the earth seems fairer
than the moon''

534
01:21:17.119 --> 01:21:27.154
''The fragrance of flowers
fills my heart''

535
01:21:29.898 --> 01:21:39.739
''The fragrance of flowers
fills my heart''

536
01:21:40.175 --> 01:21:49.948
''When evening comes,
your voice calls me''

537
01:21:50.619 --> 01:21:59.789
''When evening comes,
your voice calls me''

538
01:22:00.295 --> 01:22:10.034
''... the earth seems fairer
than the moon''

539
01:22:27.756 --> 01:22:37.495
''Your thought like a whisper''

540
01:22:40.035 --> 01:22:49.774
''Your thought like a whisper''

541
01:22:50.412 --> 01:22:59.878
''Wakes me up in the
darkest hours''

542
01:23:00.289 --> 01:23:09.721
''Wakes me up in the
darkest hours''

543
01:23:10.299 --> 01:23:19.765
''... the earth seems fairer
than the moon''

544
01:23:35.290 --> 01:23:44.790
''Why must every meeting end
in separation ?''

545
01:23:47.569 --> 01:23:59.208
''Why must every meeting end
in separation ?''

546
01:23:59.881 --> 01:24:09.415
''This thought torments me
all the time now''

547
01:24:09.992 --> 01:24:19.196
''This thought torments me
all the time now''

548
01:24:19.701 --> 01:24:28.871
''... the earth seems fairer
than the moon''

549
01:24:29.311 --> 01:24:40.313
''Whenever life brings me
to your side...''

550
01:25:10.584 --> 01:25:14.748
Umrao is crazy about Sultan

551
01:25:16.557 --> 01:25:18.548
And l have no one

552
01:25:18.960 --> 01:25:23.761
So you want to talk of love?

553
01:25:25.266 --> 01:25:27.666
What else when we're alone?

554
01:25:29.136 --> 01:25:30.626
So that's it

555
01:25:50.224 --> 01:25:52.385
Dacoits have carried away
Bismillah

556
01:26:28.229 --> 01:26:32.996
lf we'd found her corpse we could
have wept and comforted ourselves

557
01:26:40.007 --> 01:26:43.943
The Nawab Saheb is waiting outside
What ! He's come here

558
01:26:44.345 --> 01:26:46.108
Help me

559
01:26:52.219 --> 01:27:01.150
l've come here because
my niece has come of age

560
01:27:02.396 --> 01:27:10.565
You know she has been engaged
to Sultan since childhood

561
01:27:12.740 --> 01:27:17.837
l'd like to be
as soon as -

562
01:27:18.112 --> 01:27:26.076
But l informed you that
l do not accept this match

563
01:27:26.420 --> 01:27:30.550
lt was fixed before
you and l divorced

564
01:27:31.392 --> 01:27:37.297
God knows the trouble
you've caused me

565
01:27:37.932 --> 01:27:43.564
l'm surprised that you called
on me after these 15 years

566
01:27:43.871 --> 01:27:46.704
At least ask Sultan if -

567
01:27:46.907 --> 01:27:52.436
Ask Sultan ? Who knows
better than me? What's good for him?

568
01:27:53.114 --> 01:27:56.379
The trouble l've gone through
to give him a good upbringing

569
01:27:56.650 --> 01:27:59.084
And l didn't take a penny
from you for his upkeep

570
01:27:59.353 --> 01:28:03.881
But l want this match for Sultan's
own good

571
01:28:04.291 --> 01:28:14.531
Perhaps you don't know
that Sultan is going astray

572
01:28:15.035 --> 01:28:18.596
He visits courtesans

573
01:28:18.873 --> 01:28:23.572
How dare you malign my child! Since
when have you worried about his good

574
01:28:23.944 --> 01:28:29.610
Where were you till now ? Say rather
that you want a match for your niece

575
01:28:30.017 --> 01:28:32.349
Look at yourself

576
01:28:34.555 --> 01:28:38.719
You wrecked our home for that
wretched Khanum

577
01:28:40.227 --> 01:28:42.923
And even now you keep
visiting her

578
01:28:44.398 --> 01:28:49.665
Visiting courtesans is
an aristocratic tradition

579
01:28:49.937 --> 01:28:55.466
A tradition for the father, yes.
For the son, its going 'astray'

580
01:28:55.743 --> 01:28:57.438
Great !

581
01:28:57.778 --> 01:29:01.771
l'd rather he visit courtesans than
marry your niece

582
01:29:04.084 --> 01:29:06.746
lt's no use arguing with you

583
01:29:08.422 --> 01:29:14.019
Sultan is my only son. l will
decide about his marriage

584
01:29:15.262 --> 01:29:19.358
l'll fix a date, let's see
what you can do about it

585
01:29:19.700 --> 01:29:26.663
l know my son won't hurt me.
He won't take a step against my wishes

586
01:29:27.508 --> 01:29:32.536
Don't trouble me, in my condition.
For God's sake, go away

587
01:29:42.623 --> 01:29:48.493
lf l could find a nice girl l'd fix
Sultans marriage at once

588
01:29:48.762 --> 01:29:53.131
Then we'd see what the Nawab could do.
He couldn't do a thing

589
01:29:53.467 --> 01:29:56.800
Sultan won't marry
against my wishes

590
01:30:10.684 --> 01:30:14.017
My child, come
and sit near me

591
01:30:31.572 --> 01:30:32.937
You're very late

592
01:30:33.841 --> 01:30:38.437
Ever since Bismillah went,
Khanum doesn't let me come out alone

593
01:30:39.280 --> 01:30:40.713
lt was difficult to get away

594
01:30:43.784 --> 01:30:45.775
You seem troubled

595
01:30:55.696 --> 01:30:59.860
Perhaps l'm not worthy
of being told your troubles

596
01:31:01.835 --> 01:31:04.702
My troubles can't be
put into words

597
01:31:05.639 --> 01:31:08.836
Say something. lt'll lighten
your heart

598
01:31:11.445 --> 01:31:13.242
What can l say...

599
01:31:15.249 --> 01:31:22.155
l can't understand you even now.
Sometimes l feel nothing separates us

600
01:31:23.123 --> 01:31:29.119
At other times it seems your
inner world is hidden from me

601
01:31:30.030 --> 01:31:34.831
Why think so ? l've never
considered you an outsider

602
01:31:36.937 --> 01:31:38.768
Then why hide things
from me?

603
01:31:42.209 --> 01:31:47.408
Father never met us. Now suddenly
he wants me to marry his niece

604
01:31:47.748 --> 01:31:49.045
Why don't you ?

605
01:31:51.852 --> 01:31:53.877
For your sake l'll bear
even that

606
01:31:55.155 --> 01:32:01.219
Mother is dead against it. She wants
me to have nothing to do with them

607
01:32:02.129 --> 01:32:03.790
l don't know what to do

608
01:32:05.933 --> 01:32:11.667
Do whatever your mother says.
Her claim on you is greater

609
01:32:13.240 --> 01:32:15.800
You have my best wishes anyway

610
01:32:17.811 --> 01:32:21.042
Mother may not like that, either

611
01:32:45.139 --> 01:32:46.436
Listen

612
01:32:59.486 --> 01:33:36.623
You sing well
- Who are you?

613
01:33:38.358 --> 01:33:43.489
He wants to meet you.
- He has talked to Khanum

614
01:34:09.490 --> 01:34:13.950
l saw you some months back,
in passing

615
01:34:15.762 --> 01:34:20.961
Once l thought of coming here
but somehow l didn't

616
01:34:22.870 --> 01:34:28.001
And then the house was closed
for ''Mohurrum''

617
01:34:28.575 --> 01:34:31.738
l too went home
on some work

618
01:34:34.014 --> 01:34:36.175
l kept thinking of you

619
01:34:38.318 --> 01:34:44.780
Wondering what you were like,
how your voice would sound

620
01:34:46.426 --> 01:34:50.453
Thinking of something ?
- No

621
01:34:51.064 --> 01:34:54.397
All right, you needn't
tell me

622
01:34:57.738 --> 01:35:02.038
Here - a gift

623
01:35:10.217 --> 01:35:11.582
Keep it

624
01:35:19.192 --> 01:35:22.684
But this is a diamond !
ls it for me ?

625
01:35:23.330 --> 01:35:24.524
Don't you like it ?

626
01:35:25.799 --> 01:35:31.635
l like it, but ... does he love
you very much ?

627
01:35:34.741 --> 01:35:40.145
Who can have faith in such love?
- lt's faith that turns into love

628
01:35:40.480 --> 01:35:45.213
Look at me. Faith in Husseini has
kept me here all my life

629
01:35:46.053 --> 01:35:47.714
You're different

630
01:35:48.288 --> 01:35:51.587
No, my child, it's the
same thing

631
01:35:52.960 --> 01:35:57.988
Either make someone your own
or belong to someone

632
01:36:03.804 --> 01:36:05.271
l tried

633
01:36:06.440 --> 01:36:07.998
Try again

634
01:36:09.576 --> 01:36:15.412
You don't belong in a bordello.
The whole world is yours

635
01:36:43.110 --> 01:36:44.099
Do you drink ?

636
01:36:45.646 --> 01:36:47.978
No, sir

637
01:36:54.154 --> 01:37:00.286
Okay. l'm going to my village
for some days

638
01:37:00.560 --> 01:37:02.687
Where ?
- Farrukhabad

639
01:37:07.668 --> 01:37:08.760
Want to come with me ?

640
01:37:10.103 --> 01:37:12.970
Khanum will not let me
out of Lucknow with anyone

641
01:37:13.540 --> 01:37:17.135
l'm not just anyone.
l am a landlord

642
01:37:17.778 --> 01:37:21.009
l'll give 2 months salary
as advance

643
01:37:21.948 --> 01:37:24.212
l'll ask Khanum, Nawab Saheb

644
01:37:26.253 --> 01:37:32.590
Nawab Saheb ! Who, me?

645
01:37:32.859 --> 01:37:34.486
What else should l call you?

646
01:37:39.666 --> 01:37:42.794
Call me Nawab Saheb.
l like it

647
01:38:22.843 --> 01:38:27.610
l've come to invite you.
l'm getting married tomorrow

648
01:38:28.515 --> 01:38:32.975
God bless you.
May the bride prosper

649
01:38:34.287 --> 01:38:36.084
How nice these clothes look!

650
01:39:15.462 --> 01:39:17.589
Ah, the lovers of these days!

651
01:39:19.766 --> 01:39:24.863
l too tore someone's
wedding clothes, but you see

652
01:39:34.281 --> 01:39:35.407
Who was this boy?

653
01:39:38.852 --> 01:39:42.117
lf you like, l'll get him here,
bound hand and foot

654
01:39:44.958 --> 01:39:50.919
Why weep for him?
They're all like this

655
01:39:51.965 --> 01:39:56.402
They swagger about in the square
but a little mouse scares them

656
01:39:59.339 --> 01:40:02.604
The English have made
our stupid King useless

657
01:40:06.413 --> 01:40:09.507
These nobles are immersed
in luxury

658
01:40:13.520 --> 01:40:17.149
l tell you, soon the English
will come in

659
01:40:18.058 --> 01:40:21.152
Then all their aristocracy
will vanish

660
01:40:23.129 --> 01:40:24.619
What's wrong ?

661
01:40:26.433 --> 01:40:29.459
My head aches
- Should l massage it ?

662
01:40:33.874 --> 01:40:39.540
Come with me. With the fresh air
you'll never get a headache

663
01:40:41.481 --> 01:40:45.645
l can't take you away
against your wish

664
01:40:46.553 --> 01:40:48.020
lf it had been
any other woman ...

665
01:40:49.956 --> 01:40:51.981
Don't know who he thinks
he is

666
01:40:52.525 --> 01:40:56.017
''months ? Don't agree, even
if he offers 2 years salary''

667
01:40:56.863 --> 01:41:01.800
Look at his face! Thinks
every woman is his concubine

668
01:41:02.302 --> 01:41:08.969
When he comes next, throw Rs.150
in his face and tell me to get lost

669
01:41:09.342 --> 01:41:13.642
That day he called me
an old woman

670
01:41:14.080 --> 01:41:15.377
Here's 500 rupees

671
01:41:15.782 --> 01:41:19.548
An advance for a recital
by Umrao from the Rao of Sitapur

672
01:41:21.521 --> 01:41:26.424
l won't go. Return the money
- Khanum never does that

673
01:41:26.893 --> 01:41:31.592
l have a headache
- You'll be all right by evening

674
01:41:32.399 --> 01:41:34.230
When is the recital ?
- Tomorrow

675
01:41:34.567 --> 01:41:36.831
l won't go to Sitapur

676
01:41:38.004 --> 01:41:41.269
Don't talk that way.
Khanum will take offence

677
01:41:41.608 --> 01:41:44.372
You care only
for the dance

678
01:41:44.577 --> 01:41:46.067
You too get something from it

679
01:41:46.579 --> 01:41:49.707
For God's sake,
don't bother me

680
01:41:50.083 --> 01:41:54.383
What's wrong with you? You
didn't even want to meet that man

681
01:41:54.788 --> 01:41:57.723
Then you're ready to go
with him to Farrukhabad

682
01:41:58.325 --> 01:42:02.159
We stopped you, so you don't want
to dance... your head aches

683
01:42:02.495 --> 01:42:05.020
You're forcing me
- Who's forcing anymore?

684
01:42:05.332 --> 01:42:09.428
lf a lion loves a lamb,
he starves. You must dance.

685
01:42:23.550 --> 01:42:24.983
l'll go with you

686
01:42:28.788 --> 01:42:30.278
You will?

687
01:42:30.657 --> 01:42:36.152
Yes, whether they let me or not,
l'll certainly go

688
01:42:36.830 --> 01:42:38.092
Secretly?

689
01:42:38.698 --> 01:42:43.294
Whichever way, take me away.
This place is stifling me

690
01:42:53.380 --> 01:42:57.146
ls your headache better?
- Yes. How far is Kanpur?

691
01:42:57.884 --> 01:42:58.873
Tired ?

692
01:42:59.686 --> 01:43:02.985
l've never been on horseback before
- Come, let's rest a while

693
01:43:15.969 --> 01:43:19.564
l didn't believe you would
come with me

694
01:43:20.240 --> 01:43:22.208
lt had become hard for me
to live in Lucknow

695
01:43:23.510 --> 01:43:27.674
l don't know why my heart
made me come with you

696
01:43:29.249 --> 01:43:34.186
Do you know who l am ?
- What does it matter now ?

697
01:43:37.791 --> 01:43:39.691
Wait here. l'll bring water

698
01:44:12.992 --> 01:44:13.981
Faiz Ali, the outlaw !

699
01:45:06.279 --> 01:45:09.077
His horse
- He must be around

700
01:45:09.449 --> 01:45:10.507
You look there

701
01:46:21.754 --> 01:46:23.016
Who was Faiz Ali to you?

702
01:46:25.258 --> 01:46:29.558
What was his relation with you ?
- None.

703
01:46:31.231 --> 01:46:33.096
Did he kidnap you ?

704
01:46:35.034 --> 01:46:36.296
No

705
01:46:36.703 --> 01:46:40.230
You were with him of your free will?
- She's his prostitute

706
01:46:41.608 --> 01:46:45.203
Did you know that he was a dacoit?

707
01:46:47.213 --> 01:46:49.477
No

708
01:46:51.217 --> 01:46:54.880
You're from Lucknow?
- Yes

709
01:46:55.288 --> 01:46:56.277
What is your name?

710
01:47:07.400 --> 01:47:09.868
Were you with Faiz Ali ?
- Yes

711
01:47:10.270 --> 01:47:14.229
ls this same Umrao you told about?
- Yes

712
01:47:14.841 --> 01:47:18.402
How's Mother? When did you
leave Lucknow?

713
01:47:19.746 --> 01:47:21.475
Why don't you sit down?

714
01:47:25.151 --> 01:47:28.211
ln Lucknow everyone
thinks that you...

715
01:47:28.521 --> 01:47:31.649
Several times l thought
of writing

716
01:47:32.158 --> 01:47:38.324
But l was scared of Mother.
She'll come at once and take me away

717
01:47:38.631 --> 01:47:42.158
ls the Rajah a good man?
- Very

718
01:47:42.502 --> 01:47:44.800
The bandits would have
killed me that very day

719
01:47:45.204 --> 01:47:52.235
The Rajah - God bless him - caught
them. l've been with him ever since

720
01:47:52.578 --> 01:47:57.038
Are you happy ?
l'm a queen. l live in comfort

721
01:47:57.717 --> 01:48:01.483
Where were you going with Faiz Ali?
- Kanpur

722
01:48:02.355 --> 01:48:05.324
Where will you go now?
Back to Lucknow?

723
01:48:06.092 --> 01:48:10.119
lf l know where, l wouldn't
be wandering around

724
01:48:10.596 --> 01:48:11.927
Still...

725
01:48:14.667 --> 01:48:19.331
Can you get me escorted
to Kanpur ?

726
01:48:28.681 --> 01:48:41.355
''Whenever l meet life,
it seems a stranger to me''

727
01:48:42.261 --> 01:48:54.196
''Why does life change colors
everyday ?''

728
01:48:55.074 --> 01:49:06.144
''Why does life change colors
everyday ?''

729
01:49:10.723 --> 01:49:15.092
The evenings have become more
colorful since she came to Kanpur

730
01:49:15.428 --> 01:49:17.726
Listen, my friends

731
01:49:18.197 --> 01:49:20.028
You listen too, Umrao Jaan

732
01:49:20.400 --> 01:49:23.563
Yesterday l passed a locality

733
01:49:23.970 --> 01:49:28.600
There was a song being sung
and a big crowd

734
01:49:28.908 --> 01:49:35.507
l listened carefully, and
it was a ghazal by Umrao Jaan

735
01:50:06.946 --> 01:50:11.076
Does the singer from Lucknow
live here?

736
01:50:11.317 --> 01:50:13.376
Yes. Go up the stairs

737
01:50:30.570 --> 01:50:33.198
Are you Umrao Jaan?
- Yes, ma'am

738
01:50:33.639 --> 01:50:38.906
Our lady has called you.
Tomorrow is her son's birthday

739
01:50:39.779 --> 01:50:41.804
She'd like you to perform

740
01:50:42.448 --> 01:50:44.939
How does she know me ?

741
01:50:45.251 --> 01:50:47.685
She is also from Lucknow

742
01:50:48.187 --> 01:50:50.087
You're from Lucknow, too

743
01:50:50.656 --> 01:50:55.252
How did you know ?
A certain style in your speech

744
01:50:56.229 --> 01:51:01.166
Keep this, the rest will be
settled later

745
01:51:02.468 --> 01:51:06.666
l'll keep it so the Begum
is not offended

746
01:51:07.106 --> 01:51:08.664
Right, then l'll go

747
01:52:14.974 --> 01:52:18.102
l feel we have met
somewhere before

748
01:52:19.145 --> 01:52:22.740
Strange. l was about to say
the same

749
01:52:42.868 --> 01:52:45.962
Are you - Amiran ?

750
01:52:49.709 --> 01:52:50.300
You're...

751
01:52:51.143 --> 01:52:55.204
Remember me ? l'm Ramdei

752
01:52:56.716 --> 01:53:09.652
''Since l parted from you
whom will l meet now ?''

753
01:53:10.563 --> 01:53:24.204
''See what colors
life shows me?''

754
01:53:24.377 --> 01:53:35.845
''See what colors
life shows me?''

755
01:53:39.759 --> 01:53:44.196
Amiran, if they'd chosen you
instead of me!

756
01:53:45.264 --> 01:53:50.463
Then you'd have got the
bordello and l this mansion

757
01:53:51.637 --> 01:53:54.435
Where is your husband ?

758
01:53:54.874 --> 01:53:57.843
He's gone to Calcutta.
He'll be back by tomorrow

759
01:53:58.711 --> 01:54:00.645
Now tell me about yourself

760
01:54:02.314 --> 01:54:08.480
Why? lt's a happy occasion,
talk of nice things

761
01:54:09.255 --> 01:54:12.418
Here's a suitable couplet

762
01:54:12.925 --> 01:54:25.702
''What a favor the passage
of time has done me''

763
01:54:26.772 --> 01:54:38.707
''That the earth seems
more beautiful than the moon''

764
01:54:39.151 --> 01:54:51.120
''That the earth seems
more beautiful than the moon''

765
01:55:14.086 --> 01:55:18.318
l forgot. Nawab Saheb,
this is Umrao Jaan

766
01:55:27.233 --> 01:55:29.030
Umrao Jaan's carriage
is ready

767
01:55:36.075 --> 01:55:40.876
Are you leaving?
- Yes, l ask your leave

768
01:55:43.549 --> 01:55:46.882
And if we refuse it?

769
01:56:07.873 --> 01:56:22.049
''l did not find
what l looked for''

770
01:56:22.988 --> 01:56:31.726
''l did not find
what l looked for''

771
01:56:32.064 --> 01:56:40.938
'' But this became an excuse
for seeing the world''

772
01:56:41.240 --> 01:56:44.767
''What l was looking for...''

773
01:57:04.730 --> 01:57:25.608
''l didn't embarrass you,
nor do l have any regrets''

774
01:57:25.985 --> 01:57:39.922
''Thus l maintained
the tradition of love''

775
01:57:40.165 --> 01:57:49.198
''Thus l maintained
the tradition of love''

776
01:57:49.608 --> 01:57:53.066
''What l lost...''

777
01:58:10.462 --> 01:58:30.680
''l don't remember when
l got you, when l lost you''

778
01:58:31.150 --> 01:58:45.053
''Life, l think l only saw you
in a dream''

779
01:58:45.464 --> 01:58:54.236
''Life, l think l only saw you
in a dream''

780
01:58:54.573 --> 01:58:58.441
''What l lost...''

781
01:59:17.997 --> 01:59:37.908
''Says 'Ada', what can l say
of my condition?''

782
01:59:38.817 --> 01:59:52.595
''The long journey of life
l traversed alone''

783
01:59:53.098 --> 02:00:01.904
''The long journey of life
l traversed alone''

784
02:00:02.207 --> 02:00:10.876
''l did not find
what l looked for''

785
02:00:11.250 --> 02:00:20.124
'' But this became an excuse
for seeing the world''

786
02:00:20.225 --> 02:00:24.286
''What l was looking for...''

787
02:00:36.256 --> 02:00:37.621
My child!

788
02:00:40.293 --> 02:00:45.822
How hard-hearted you are.
Don't you love anyone any more

789
02:00:46.800 --> 02:00:55.265
Your Maulvi Saheb suffers so
much, thinking of you all the time

790
02:01:08.688 --> 02:01:09.950
How is Khanum?

791
02:01:10.390 --> 02:01:16.420
Losing her daughter half killed
her Losing you has finished her

792
02:01:21.535 --> 02:01:22.661
We have come
to take you back

793
02:01:51.665 --> 02:01:54.600
Umrao, where did you go ?

794
02:01:55.101 --> 02:01:59.162
You look quite well
- Why should l be ill?

795
02:01:59.573 --> 02:02:00.904
Aunt Husseini said you...

796
02:02:02.375 --> 02:02:06.778
What else could l say.
She wouldn't have come easily

797
02:02:07.514 --> 02:02:13.077
We brought her up, and now that
she's earning she goes her own way

798
02:02:14.387 --> 02:02:17.379
The dove lays the eggs
and the crow eats them

799
02:02:18.792 --> 02:02:22.592
So that's why you came to fetch me?
- Husseini, you are getting old

800
02:02:22.963 --> 02:02:26.194
She comes home after months
and you start talking rot

801
02:02:26.600 --> 02:02:29.763
Don't take it so hard.
She says any odd things

802
02:02:30.170 --> 02:02:33.037
No, l won't stay in Lucknow

803
02:02:33.707 --> 02:02:37.438
Stay till 'Muharram'.
Then you may go where you wish

804
02:02:37.844 --> 02:02:40.176
Come to me, my child

805
02:02:44.017 --> 02:02:46.281
Go to your room and rest

806
02:02:55.262 --> 02:02:57.162
She won't stay here

807
02:02:59.466 --> 02:03:03.630
The filly has started bucking
- So we'll fence her in

808
02:03:14.714 --> 02:03:20.949
Bless you, my child. God give you
the riches of knowledge

809
02:04:04.664 --> 02:04:06.495
Are you unwell?

810
02:04:08.768 --> 02:04:13.330
Should l massage your head?
- Let me be, l don't have a headache

811
02:04:15.108 --> 02:04:16.166
Even if you don't...

812
02:04:19.045 --> 02:04:22.674
Why this sudden show of love?
Short of cash?

813
02:04:23.116 --> 02:04:27.143
Why say such
un-poetic things?

814
02:04:28.288 --> 02:04:32.486
For a true lover, sweet words
of the beloved are enough

815
02:04:36.529 --> 02:04:38.463
What'll happen to me
when you leave?

816
02:04:39.733 --> 02:04:41.291
The same as last time

817
02:04:42.802 --> 02:04:49.105
She heard me weeping but
she did not even ask

818
02:04:49.709 --> 02:04:54.772
What is this sound of crying
that l hear?

819
02:04:57.884 --> 02:04:59.909
The old woman won't let you
go so easily

820
02:05:02.122 --> 02:05:05.114
Even if you leave,
she'll fetch you back

821
02:05:06.426 --> 02:05:07.984
There's only one way

822
02:05:10.663 --> 02:05:11.925
Get married to someone

823
02:05:13.700 --> 02:05:15.497
ls that a proposal?

824
02:05:16.836 --> 02:05:19.828
Really. You stand to gain...

825
02:05:20.907 --> 02:05:24.343
... by marrying me. Khanum's
hold on you will weaken

826
02:05:24.778 --> 02:05:28.737
And after marriage? l'll earn
and you'll eat

827
02:05:29.883 --> 02:05:32.852
l don't want to go out of the
frying-pan and into the fire

828
02:05:54.707 --> 02:05:56.572
ls your name Umrao Jaan?

829
02:05:57.210 --> 02:05:58.177
Yes

830
02:05:58.545 --> 02:06:06.179
l've come from the court. According
to this, Gohar Mirza submits

831
02:06:07.187 --> 02:06:12.819
... that his lawful wedded wife,
Umrao Jaan...

832
02:06:12.992 --> 02:06:18.624
... wants to live with another
man without getting a divorce

833
02:06:22.101 --> 02:06:26.765
The hearing is on the 18th.
Be present in the court

834
02:06:27.173 --> 02:06:29.607
Your statements will be recorded.
Here's the summons

835
02:07:29.168 --> 02:07:32.604
This is a copy of our
marriage contract

836
02:07:36.276 --> 02:07:39.973
Apart from Aunty and Khanum, some
15 others were present at the wedding

837
02:07:42.815 --> 02:07:47.479
Your obstinacy forced me to spend
a lot of money. But l had to do it

838
02:08:07.307 --> 02:08:13.678
lt's false. All this
is false

839
02:08:28.861 --> 02:08:32.262
l swear, Umrao,
l'm not to blame

840
02:08:34.767 --> 02:08:36.826
Actually, Khanum is
not to blame either

841
02:08:38.404 --> 02:08:40.395
At this age, what else
can she do?

842
02:08:42.308 --> 02:08:44.469
Wait till the new girl
grows up?

843
02:08:47.780 --> 02:08:49.680
lt's our fate
that is to blame

844
02:08:51.217 --> 02:08:54.209
Not fate: circumstances

845
02:08:59.359 --> 02:09:01.190
Can't you withdraw
the case?

846
02:09:04.030 --> 02:09:07.557
One who has lived off
Khanum's leftovers would not dare

847
02:09:09.202 --> 02:09:12.968
Go to Kanpur. My house
is empty

848
02:09:14.607 --> 02:09:16.268
What will l eat?

849
02:10:19.505 --> 02:10:23.407
Damn Gohar Mirza. He had to
leave at such a time

850
02:10:24.177 --> 02:10:25.974
The British are in
every alley

851
02:10:32.318 --> 02:10:33.842
God help us

852
02:10:47.767 --> 02:10:53.000
They'll break down the gate.
Go out, over the wall

853
02:12:20.793 --> 02:12:24.991
This is Faizabad. The convoy for
Beneras will leave in the morning

854
02:12:25.765 --> 02:12:31.032
We'll have to spend the night here
- ln this wilderness?

855
02:12:31.437 --> 02:12:33.428
Can't help it

856
02:12:33.773 --> 02:12:35.604
Our blessed fate!

857
02:13:39.939 --> 02:13:46.606
''That which has no face''

858
02:13:46.979 --> 02:13:52.212
''That which has no name''

859
02:13:52.752 --> 02:14:25.212
''Why do l long for such a thing''

860
02:14:27.787 --> 02:14:32.520
ln Faizabad, your poetry has made a
greater mark than even your singing

861
02:14:33.025 --> 02:14:35.926
lnvitation for performances
would be welcome

862
02:14:36.629 --> 02:14:38.563
Poetry is not enough
for a living

863
02:14:39.165 --> 02:14:41.292
Recall your performance
at our place

864
02:15:00.186 --> 02:15:08.924
''What place is this, my friends''

865
02:15:13.332 --> 02:15:19.737
''What place is this, my friends''

866
02:15:20.139 --> 02:15:24.735
''What location is this?''

867
02:15:25.111 --> 02:15:29.673
''What location is this?''

868
02:15:32.051 --> 02:15:52.360
''Where, as far as one can see,
there's dust and only dust?''

869
02:15:52.872 --> 02:15:59.778
''What place is this, my friends''

870
02:16:26.605 --> 02:16:41.179
''To what juncture...''

871
02:16:41.487 --> 02:16:49.986
''...has life now brought me?''

872
02:16:52.264 --> 02:17:12.448
''Where l have no control
over sorrow or joy''

873
02:17:12.818 --> 02:17:19.587
''What place is this, my friends''

874
02:17:19.758 --> 02:17:23.922
''What location is this?''

875
02:17:24.163 --> 02:17:29.066
''What location is this?''

876
02:17:51.190 --> 02:18:12.273
''Life asks an account
of the days gone by''

877
02:18:14.346 --> 02:18:34.427
''My heart has no answer.
lt's full of remorse''

878
02:18:35.201 --> 02:18:41.401
''What place is this, my friends''

879
02:18:41.707 --> 02:18:45.973
''What location is this?''

880
02:18:46.312 --> 02:18:50.874
''What location is this?''

881
02:19:09.235 --> 02:19:29.521
'' Beyond the blinds
who beckons me?''

882
02:19:29.888 --> 02:19:50.197
''ls someone still sad and
restless for me?''

883
02:19:50.509 --> 02:19:56.846
''What place is this,
my friends?''

884
02:19:57.149 --> 02:20:01.518
''What location is this?''

885
02:20:01.854 --> 02:20:05.688
''What location is this?''

886
02:20:06.625 --> 02:20:19.436
''Where, as far as one can see,
there's dust and only dust?''

887
02:20:19.805 --> 02:20:29.703
''What place is this, my friends''

888
02:21:03.121 --> 02:21:06.716
You're the one from Lucknow?
- Yes

889
02:21:07.192 --> 02:21:13.392
What is your name?
- How does it matter?

890
02:21:13.832 --> 02:21:17.233
Are you a prostitute
by birth?

891
02:21:18.703 --> 02:21:22.605
No, by force of
circumstances

892
02:21:23.809 --> 02:21:28.109
Say something about yourself.
Who are you?

893
02:21:28.880 --> 02:21:33.180
How can l say who l am?

894
02:21:33.518 --> 02:21:36.510
Where is your real home?

895
02:21:37.756 --> 02:21:42.420
My real home is
where l'm standing now

896
02:21:46.731 --> 02:21:52.795
Are you Amiran ?

897
02:22:00.412 --> 02:22:03.006
Where did you go,
my darling?

898
02:22:04.149 --> 02:22:08.711
Where are Father and my brother?
- Your father died long back

899
02:22:11.323 --> 02:22:17.353
My darling! Where did you go?

900
02:22:24.302 --> 02:22:32.175
Deserting your mother's world,
which world have you settled in?

901
02:22:36.248 --> 02:22:42.209
No, Mother, this is not Amiran, this
is Umrao Jaan, the famous courtesan

902
02:22:50.428 --> 02:22:52.020
Brother!

903
02:22:53.532 --> 02:22:55.864
You've brought glory
to the family

904
02:22:57.769 --> 02:23:00.499
We thought you were dead

905
02:23:02.307 --> 02:23:07.574
But you're still alive.
You should have drowned yourself

906
02:23:08.079 --> 02:23:09.944
lt'll be better
if you go away

907
02:23:23.528 --> 02:23:25.223
My child
