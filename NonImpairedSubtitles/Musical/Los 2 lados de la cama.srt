1
00:00:28,329 --> 00:00:33,641
THE 2 SIDES OF THE BED

2
00:00:33,942 --> 00:00:36,442
Dancing,

3
00:00:39,623 --> 00:00:41,625
<i> Dancing, </i>

4
00:00:42,459 --> 00:00:46,088
<i> I spend the whole day dancing </i>

5
00:00:46,797 --> 00:00:50,884
<i> and meanwhile the neighbors</i>

6
00:00:51,593 --> 00:00:55,472
<i> keep bothering me.</i>

7
00:00:57,975 --> 00:01:00,394
<i> Drinking, </i>

8
00:01:00,561 --> 00:01:04,022
<i> I spend the whole day drinking, </i>

9
00:01:05,065 --> 00:01:08,527
<i> with the cocktail shaker ... </i>

10
00:01:10,946 --> 00:01:13,907
<i> full of soda and vermouth. </i>

11
00:01:17,494 --> 00:01:21,623
<i> My bones are dislocated, </i>

12
00:01:22,499 --> 00:01:26,920
<i> my femur is way out of line. </i>

13
00:01:27,212 --> 00:01:30,007
<i> My body is in a mess ...</i>

14
00:01:31,216 --> 00:01:35,888
<i> but my social life ...</i>

15
00:01:33,177 --> 00:01:35,888
<i> but my social life! </i>

16
00:01:51,653 --> 00:01:55,574
<i> is going just fine, </i>

17
00:01:56,700 --> 00:02:00,829
<i> I dance all day long. </i>

18
00:02:00,954 --> 00:02:02,956
<i> with or without a partneré, </i>

19
00:02:03,957 --> 00:02:05,542
<i> I move my leg, I move my foot. </i>

20
00:02:05,709 --> 00:02:07,920
<i> I move my tibia and fibula, </i>

21
00:02:08,086 --> 00:02:12,508
<i> I move my head, I move my sternum.
    I move my hip when I get the chance </i>

22
00:02:28,148 --> 00:02:30,609
<i> Drinking, </i>

23
00:02:31,276 --> 00:02:34,988
<i> I spend the whole day drinking, </i>

24
00:02:35,614 --> 00:02:39,576
<i> with the cocktail shaker ... </i>

25
00:02:40,327 --> 00:02:47,042
<i> full of soda and vermouth. </i>

26
00:02:55,425 --> 00:02:56,510
Bravo!

27
00:03:14,862 --> 00:03:15,946
Waiter!

28
00:03:18,240 --> 00:03:19,408
To your wedding.

29
00:03:19,908 --> 00:03:21,410
May you be very happy.

30
00:03:21,618 --> 00:03:23,245
And to you two.

31
00:03:23,412 --> 00:03:24,913
May you get married soon too.

32
00:03:25,080 --> 00:03:28,041
I think we'll see
how it goes, right?

33
00:03:28,208 --> 00:03:31,545
Yes. The way to see it,|is to see how it goes, right?

34
00:03:31,712 --> 00:03:34,381
Of course.|It's best to do things slowly.

35
00:03:34,548 --> 00:03:35,632
What?

36
00:03:36,300 --> 00:03:39,386
Maybe we should wait a bit,|don't you think?

37
00:03:39,553 --> 00:03:41,138
Wait a bit?

38
00:03:42,556 --> 00:03:44,850
Eu quase tive um ataque do coração!

39
00:03:45,184 --> 00:03:48,187
What I like most about Marta|is her sense of humor.

40
00:03:48,353 --> 00:03:49,438
"Wait a bit", she says!

41
00:03:52,191 --> 00:03:55,319
It's a pity we can't all get married|at the same time.

42
00:03:55,485 --> 00:03:57,154
But maybe we can|christen the children ...

43
00:03:57,321 --> 00:03:58,322
at the same time.|- No.

44
00:03:59,239 --> 00:04:02,826
- No children, Javier.|- Why not?

45
00:04:03,493 --> 00:04:06,455
It's important to have children.|What do you think?

46
00:04:08,415 --> 00:04:11,126
I think the food|is disagreeing with me.

47
00:04:11,335 --> 00:04:12,544
- Really?|- What's wrong?

48
00:04:12,711 --> 00:04:14,421
You want some chamomile?

49
00:04:14,546 --> 00:04:15,631
It's as if...

50
00:04:15,839 --> 00:04:17,674
I feel short of breath.

51
00:04:17,841 --> 00:04:21,261
I don't mean have one tomorrow,|but maybe in a few years...

52
00:04:21,428 --> 00:04:23,388
Chamomile is good for everything.

53
00:04:23,555 --> 00:04:25,432
I don't want anything, Pedro.

54
00:04:25,807 --> 00:04:28,810
We'll see about children.|Shall we go to the washroom?

55
00:04:28,977 --> 00:04:32,147
- Yes, we'd better.|- Don't get sick now..

56
00:04:32,356 --> 00:04:33,774
I'll order chamomile.

57
00:04:33,941 --> 00:04:36,568
Look, she doesn't want chamomile.|Come on.

58
00:04:39,238 --> 00:04:40,405
Sorry.

59
00:04:48,705 --> 00:04:50,874
They're both nervous|about the wedding.

60
00:04:51,041 --> 00:04:52,167
Raquel too.

61
00:05:11,895 --> 00:05:13,313
I can't take it anymore.

62
00:05:13,814 --> 00:05:16,733
Neither can I. You've been|turning me on all night.

63
00:05:16,900 --> 00:05:20,070
Stop, stop, I don't mean that.|We can't go on like this.

64
00:05:23,240 --> 00:05:24,366
It's true.

65
00:05:26,577 --> 00:05:27,619
Marta!

66
00:05:31,748 --> 00:05:34,877
I'm finished with messing around.

67
00:05:35,043 --> 00:05:37,254
I want to settle down with Marta.

68
00:05:37,588 --> 00:05:40,215
I'd rather watch TV with her|than be out on the town...

69
00:05:40,549 --> 00:05:42,843
trying to pick up some girl...

70
00:05:43,010 --> 00:05:45,053
Hey, I'm sorry about ...

71
00:05:45,971 --> 00:05:46,889
}about...

72
00:05:48,765 --> 00:05:50,267
There it is!

73
00:05:59,902 --> 00:06:01,111
Thank you.

74
00:06:09,953 --> 00:06:12,456
Do you guys know|where the washroom is?

75
00:06:13,457 --> 00:06:14,416
It's that way.

76
00:06:14,583 --> 00:06:15,584
It's that way.

77
00:06:15,959 --> 00:06:17,044
Where?

78
00:06:26,178 --> 00:06:29,097
- I'm sorry!|- Don't worry, it's all right.

79
00:06:29,264 --> 00:06:30,182
It was nothing.

80
00:06:31,558 --> 00:06:33,560
I'm going to the washroom.

81
00:06:41,318 --> 00:06:43,153
What were you saying about?

82
00:06:44,488 --> 00:06:51,495
I don't know.

83
00:06:51,662 --> 00:06:52,663
Like that?

84
00:06:52,829 --> 00:06:55,040
Yes, like that!|Yes, yes, yes, yes

85
00:06:55,374 --> 00:06:58,585
Hey, quit all that yessing,|I'm wetting myself!

86
00:07:02,005 --> 00:07:03,799
The meal disagreed with her..

87
00:07:04,842 --> 00:07:07,803
Yes, the duck.|It really disagreed with me.

88
00:07:08,887 --> 00:07:10,180
The duck!!

89
00:07:12,057 --> 00:07:14,268
Yeah, yeah, the duck!

90
00:07:15,227 --> 00:07:17,312
Never again like that, never.

91
00:07:17,479 --> 00:07:19,982
I know,|you like me to be gentle.

92
00:07:21,733 --> 00:07:23,360
- Come on.|- I'm wetting myself.

93
00:07:23,527 --> 00:07:24,862
Not now. Come on.

94
00:07:25,028 --> 00:07:27,614
You two with the duck,

95
00:07:27,781 --> 00:07:29,992
you left "sumsin".

96
00:07:30,701 --> 00:07:33,120
She was really sick.|Come on.

97
00:07:39,668 --> 00:07:42,129
Shit, they were mine!

98
00:07:47,885 --> 00:07:49,428
These couples!

99
00:07:49,595 --> 00:07:51,346
What took you so long?

100
00:07:51,597 --> 00:07:55,225
We came along Mediterraneo,|Mariano de Cavia, Menendez Pelayo,

101
00:07:55,392 --> 00:07:58,395
and instead of taking Goya|went down Juan Bravo.

102
00:07:58,562 --> 00:07:59,980
And the traffic!

103
00:08:00,314 --> 00:08:03,567
I don't know what you girls|are doing tonight, but we...

104
00:08:03,901 --> 00:08:06,820
Cheer up,|this is your hen party.

105
00:08:06,987 --> 00:08:09,615
Fun and games, we're in Spain!|Right, Carlitos?

106
00:08:09,781 --> 00:08:11,241
- Fun and games.|- Rafa,

107
00:08:11,575 --> 00:08:13,202
ease up a bit.

108
00:08:13,410 --> 00:08:14,411
Sorry.

109
00:08:15,329 --> 00:08:17,164
- Hello.|- Pedro...

110
00:08:17,915 --> 00:08:20,000
- I was going to say...|- Yes, Rafa.

111
00:08:20,167 --> 00:08:22,377
There was a blond|in the restaurant and...

112
00:08:22,586 --> 00:08:24,171
Here we go ...

113
00:08:24,338 --> 00:08:27,466
Haven't we got|anything better to talk about?

114
00:08:27,633 --> 00:08:31,637
We're a bit old to be|talking tits and asses all day.

115
00:08:31,803 --> 00:08:33,555
- Come on, pet.|- Yes, lover.

116
00:08:33,764 --> 00:08:35,724
Grow up a bit, Pedro.

117
00:08:35,933 --> 00:08:37,351
But...

118
00:08:38,393 --> 00:08:42,356
My darling, my darling,|don't leave me for a male stripper.

119
00:08:42,523 --> 00:08:45,692
I'm telling you,|they're all muscle and no brain.

120
00:08:45,859 --> 00:08:47,444
Not like you.

121
00:08:48,195 --> 00:08:49,238
I'm going.

122
00:08:49,404 --> 00:08:50,739
I'm going.

123
00:08:52,282 --> 00:08:55,911
The meal really disagreed with you.|You've got a huge rash there.

124
00:08:56,078 --> 00:08:58,539
- Pedro, I had an allergy.|- All right.

125
00:08:58,747 --> 00:09:00,916
If we don't go now|we'll miss the Happy Hour.

126
00:09:01,083 --> 00:09:04,586
All right.|See you back home.

127
00:09:04,795 --> 00:09:06,255
- Come on!|- So long, gorgeous.

128
00:09:06,421 --> 00:09:07,673
Hey!

129
00:09:07,840 --> 00:09:08,799
My love!

130
00:09:08,966 --> 00:09:10,592
My love!

131
00:09:11,468 --> 00:09:12,761
Have fun!

132
00:09:15,138 --> 00:09:16,765
I'm getting married tomorrow, guys!

133
00:09:16,974 --> 00:09:19,184
You're getting married?

134
00:09:20,477 --> 00:09:22,938
- Hello.|- Hello. Who to?

135
00:09:23,105 --> 00:09:25,023
To...

136
00:09:25,440 --> 00:09:27,067
See that brunette?

137
00:09:28,318 --> 00:09:29,444
The brunette?

138
00:09:29,611 --> 00:09:30,571
Yes.

139
00:09:30,779 --> 00:09:31,738
And the other one?

140
00:09:31,905 --> 00:09:34,491
No, the other one,|the blonde, is mine.

141
00:09:36,159 --> 00:09:38,871
And what are they?|Real good friends?

142
00:09:39,037 --> 00:09:41,790
Yeah, they are, like us.

143
00:09:43,167 --> 00:09:45,335
Maybe this is silly,

144
00:09:45,669 --> 00:09:48,922
but I think they're closer friends|than you are.

145
00:09:49,089 --> 00:09:52,885
No, he and I are inseparable.

146
00:09:53,051 --> 00:09:54,178
You too?

147
00:09:54,344 --> 00:09:55,345
Yes.

148
00:09:55,512 --> 00:09:56,889
Fucking great!

149
00:09:57,055 --> 00:09:58,015
Why?

150
00:09:58,515 --> 00:10:01,143
Let's go on a stag night.

151
00:10:01,351 --> 00:10:03,312
We're just having one drink.

152
00:10:03,520 --> 00:10:06,565
I don't want the usual crap|with naked girls and all that.

153
00:10:06,732 --> 00:10:08,233
Maybe it's not such crap.

154
00:10:08,358 --> 00:10:11,278
Pedro, you don't change,|you don't evolve.

155
00:10:11,445 --> 00:10:12,654
My boyfriend left me.

156
00:10:12,863 --> 00:10:14,698
He did?|Why was that?

157
00:10:14,865 --> 00:10:17,826
I thought it was just going|to be us tonight.

158
00:10:17,993 --> 00:10:21,413
I think she likes me.
She looked at me.

159
00:10:32,591 --> 00:10:35,886
We're having a great time,|aren't we?

160
00:10:36,053 --> 00:10:38,180
Yes, it's really fun.

161
00:10:38,388 --> 00:10:42,017
- Don't dare touch me with that.|- All right, be like that!

162
00:10:42,559 --> 00:10:44,603
Have you seen those legs,

163
00:10:44,770 --> 00:10:46,188
those arms, those backs,

164
00:10:46,355 --> 00:10:47,523
those asses?

165
00:10:48,899 --> 00:10:50,859
It's a wild, crazy party.

166
00:10:52,903 --> 00:10:55,197
Why the fuck are we here?

167
00:11:01,995 --> 00:11:03,497
Do you love me?

168
00:11:03,664 --> 00:11:05,582
Of course I do,

169
00:11:06,250 --> 00:11:08,210
but it's impossible.

170
00:11:08,418 --> 00:11:10,462
- You don't understand.|- No, I don't.

171
00:11:10,754 --> 00:11:13,715
Tomorrow I'm getting married,|don't you realize?

172
00:11:13,882 --> 00:11:15,634
How could I not realize?

173
00:11:21,807 --> 00:11:25,185
{Y:i}Today, the sun is shining|through my window
174
00:11:26,603 --> 00:11:28,480
{Y:i}and my heart

175
00:11:29,565 --> 00:11:31,108
{Y:i}is growing sad

176
00:11:31,275 --> 00:11:33,569
{Y:i}as I look out at the city.

177
00:11:35,696 --> 00:11:39,616
{Y:i}Why are you leaving?

178
00:11:39,783 --> 00:11:44,580
{Y:i}Just like every night, I woke up

179
00:11:44,788 --> 00:11:46,915
{Y:i}thinking of you,

180
00:11:47,708 --> 00:11:53,422
{Y:i}and on my clock|I watched the hours go by.

181
00:11:53,589 --> 00:11:55,841
{Y:i}Why are you leaving?

182
00:11:57,718 --> 00:12:02,264
{Y:i}All of my love's promises|will leave with you.

183
00:12:02,472 --> 00:12:05,434
{Y:i}You'll forget me.

184
00:12:05,601 --> 00:12:08,478
{Y:i}You'll forget me.

185
00:12:09,771 --> 00:12:14,193
{Y:i}Today at the station|I'll be crying like a child.

186
00:12:14,526 --> 00:12:17,112
{Y:i}Why are you leaving?

187
00:12:17,279 --> 00:12:19,239
{Y:i}Why are you leaving?

188
00:12:24,620 --> 00:12:27,289
{Y:i}In the semi-darkness|of a street light,

189
00:12:28,957 --> 00:12:31,126
{Y:i}all the things

190
00:12:32,669 --> 00:12:37,216
{Y:i}that were left unsaid|will lie in slumber.

191
00:12:38,258 --> 00:12:40,052
{Y:i}They'll lie in slumber.

192
00:12:42,596 --> 00:12:46,558
{Y:i}Beside the hands of a clock,

193
00:12:47,351 --> 00:12:49,978
{Y:i}all the hours

194
00:12:50,187 --> 00:12:56,026
{Y:i}.

195
00:12:56,193 --> 00:12:57,986
{Y:i}They'll wait for you.

196
00:13:00,656 --> 00:13:04,409
{Y:i} All of my love's promises|will leave with you.

197
00:13:04,535 --> 00:13:07,538
{Y:i}You'll forget me.

198
00:13:07,704 --> 00:13:09,790
{Y:i}You'll forget me.

199
00:13:11,792 --> 00:13:15,838
{Y:i}Today at the station|I'll be crying like a child.

200
00:13:16,964 --> 00:13:19,258
{Y:i}Why are you leaving?

201
00:13:20,175 --> 00:13:22,678
{Y:i}Why are you leaving?

202
00:13:24,429 --> 00:13:26,890
{Y:i}Why are you leaving?

203
00:13:29,142 --> 00:13:34,439
{Y:i}Why are you leaving?

204
00:13:38,151 --> 00:13:39,361
You pay this, Carlos.

205
00:13:39,570 --> 00:13:41,822
Rafa, all this is over for me.

206
00:13:42,030 --> 00:13:45,701
It's time for other things.|I'm even talking about children.

207
00:13:45,868 --> 00:13:46,994
In what sense?

208
00:13:47,870 --> 00:13:49,204
In the sense of having them.

209
00:13:49,580 --> 00:13:50,706
Oh, that's fine.

210
00:13:50,914 --> 00:13:53,750
I think that Spanish reasoning|is intemal...

211
00:13:53,917 --> 00:13:55,627
and life is a vicious circle.

212
00:13:55,752 --> 00:13:57,171
- So do I.|- I've always said

213
00:13:57,379 --> 00:13:59,715
that to be happy|you have to get married.

214
00:13:59,923 --> 00:14:02,176
I'll tell you,|people aren't stupid

215
00:14:02,342 --> 00:14:04,928
and if people have always|got married...

216
00:14:05,345 --> 00:14:08,557
If they've always got married|there was a reason.

217
00:14:08,932 --> 00:14:11,977
- What about Cuba?|- What do you mean?

218
00:14:13,228 --> 00:14:16,106
ÉIt's the same in Cuba.|People get married.

219
00:14:16,940 --> 00:14:19,234
- Everyone gets married here.|- Exactly.

220
00:14:20,694 --> 00:14:23,030
You too, right?

221
00:14:23,197 --> 00:14:25,324
Well, I'm thinking about it,|but, yes.

222
00:14:25,490 --> 00:14:27,492
Why don't|you all do it together?

223
00:14:27,659 --> 00:14:30,078
- Do what?|- Get married.

224
00:14:31,622 --> 00:14:35,459
Because I still haven't|made up my mind. I'm...

225
00:14:35,626 --> 00:14:37,753
She's made up her mind.

226
00:14:37,961 --> 00:14:39,505
Yes, she wants to.

227
00:14:39,671 --> 00:14:42,216
We haven't discussed it|but I can tell.

228
00:14:42,382 --> 00:14:43,967
You're very intuitive.

229
00:14:44,134 --> 00:14:45,177
Yes, yes.

230
00:14:45,344 --> 00:14:48,013
But I know women too.

231
00:14:48,180 --> 00:14:49,806
It's been a long time.

232
00:14:50,015 --> 00:14:51,517
I'm telling you, hurry up

233
00:14:51,683 --> 00:14:53,977
or someone will come along|and carry her off.

234
00:14:57,731 --> 00:15:00,317
You're very intuitive.

235
00:15:00,484 --> 00:15:04,112
I'm the intuitive one.|I'll tell you something, Pedro.

236
00:15:04,279 --> 00:15:07,658
Maybe Pilar and I will be|getting married along with you.

237
00:15:07,824 --> 00:15:08,825
That's great, Rafa.

238
00:15:08,992 --> 00:15:10,369
You're the sad one.

239
00:15:10,536 --> 00:15:11,995
You're all on your own.

240
00:15:12,162 --> 00:15:13,997
But you're fine like that.

241
00:15:14,164 --> 00:15:15,874
Here I am, without a partner.

242
00:15:16,041 --> 00:15:19,002
So you guys|don't want anything to do

243
00:15:19,169 --> 00:15:20,796
with any other women?

244
00:15:21,004 --> 00:15:22,422
No, basically...

245
00:15:22,589 --> 00:15:25,843
When you're 20, it's different,|but we won't see 30 again.

246
00:15:26,009 --> 00:15:30,597
Look, real people,decent, ordinary people,
are faithful. Like me.

247
00:15:31,723 --> 00:15:33,058
That's a pity

248
00:15:33,392 --> 00:15:36,395
because I wanted to have|a good time tonight.

249
00:15:37,604 --> 00:15:39,648
But if you're all so faithful...

250
00:16:01,545 --> 00:16:04,756
We're fine, we've got it all|very clear, right?

251
00:16:08,385 --> 00:16:11,305
If they'd told us a year ago

252
00:16:11,471 --> 00:16:13,307
we wouldn't have believed it.

253
00:16:13,473 --> 00:16:14,516
You're telling me!

254
00:16:16,768 --> 00:16:18,270
Are you happy with me?

255
00:16:19,563 --> 00:16:21,190
Why do you ask that?

256
00:16:21,398 --> 00:16:24,359
Recently, you seem...

257
00:16:24,735 --> 00:16:26,403
- What?|- A bit colder.

258
00:16:27,070 --> 00:16:27,946
Me?

259
00:16:28,113 --> 00:16:32,117
As if you were envious that they're|getting married and we're not.

260
00:16:33,410 --> 00:16:35,454
Getting married is fine.

261
00:16:35,621 --> 00:16:40,209
But maybe we could wait a little,|and not because I've got doubts.

262
00:16:40,375 --> 00:16:43,128
But if you want to get married,

263
00:16:43,295 --> 00:16:45,506
tell me and we'll think about it.

264
00:16:45,672 --> 00:16:46,757
There he is!

265
00:16:50,177 --> 00:16:53,013
- Hello.|- You look absolutely gorgeous!

266
00:16:53,180 --> 00:16:54,056
Come off it.

267
00:16:54,264 --> 00:16:57,309
Have you had a good look at her?|If I didn't have Marta...

268
00:16:57,434 --> 00:16:58,477
Is she coming down?

269
00:16:58,852 --> 00:17:02,314
Yes, but we'll leave first.|The bride has to arrive late.

270
00:17:02,439 --> 00:17:03,315
Let's go!

271
00:17:06,193 --> 00:17:07,319
We'll talk later.

272
00:17:07,486 --> 00:17:09,404
Stop talking.|Just get married.

273
00:17:09,571 --> 00:17:10,531
Coward.

274
00:17:12,241 --> 00:17:13,700
We can't do this to them.

275
00:17:13,909 --> 00:17:16,036
If you want me to get married, I will.

276
00:17:16,119 --> 00:17:18,121
- I didn't say that.|- I don't care.

277
00:17:18,288 --> 00:17:20,874
I love Javier,|like you love Pedro.

278
00:17:21,792 --> 00:17:23,252
You'll get married too,

279
00:17:23,418 --> 00:17:25,921
and have children|and a house in the suburbs.

280
00:17:26,296 --> 00:17:28,340
And Pedro's parents are wealthy

281
00:17:28,507 --> 00:17:30,884
so maybe some day|you can stop singing

282
00:17:31,093 --> 00:17:33,053
and spend more time with him.

283
00:17:33,470 --> 00:17:35,347
Your whole lives together!

284
00:17:36,265 --> 00:17:37,558
What's wrong?

285
00:17:40,686 --> 00:17:41,645
There they are!

286
00:17:50,988 --> 00:17:52,155
But...

287
00:17:52,865 --> 00:17:54,199
Why aren't they getting out?

288
00:17:54,366 --> 00:17:55,909
She's having doubts about it!

289
00:18:00,330 --> 00:18:02,332
I've got no doubts about it.

290
00:18:03,250 --> 00:18:06,545
These six months with you|have been wonderful

291
00:18:06,712 --> 00:18:08,046
and I'll never forget you.

292
00:18:12,217 --> 00:18:13,677
She's having doubts about it.

293
00:18:13,802 --> 00:18:16,513
She's thinking,|"What am I doing with that creep?"

294
00:18:16,805 --> 00:18:18,849
"What am I doing with that creep?

295
00:18:19,683 --> 00:18:21,268
What are they doing?

296
00:18:28,859 --> 00:18:31,320
- What are you doing?|- Get out of here.

297
00:18:32,279 --> 00:18:33,197
What?

298
00:18:33,405 --> 00:18:35,741
You're going to get married,|but to me.

299
00:18:39,036 --> 00:18:40,162
I love you!

300
00:18:50,672 --> 00:18:53,509
Maybe she's confused,|or she's got doubts,

301
00:18:53,717 --> 00:18:57,471
or she's changed her mind,|or she wasn't happy,

302
00:18:57,638 --> 00:18:59,765
or she's tired,|or she's joined a sect,

303
00:18:59,932 --> 00:19:03,685
or she's rethinking her future|or she's met someone else...

304
00:19:03,894 --> 00:19:06,355
That's it.|I'm sure of it.

305
00:19:06,563 --> 00:19:08,315
No, Javier.

306
00:19:08,899 --> 00:19:11,985
She told me|she needs time to think.

307
00:19:12,152 --> 00:19:13,695
But don't worry.

308
00:19:14,071 --> 00:19:16,698
Wait a few days, she'll call you.

309
00:19:17,407 --> 00:19:19,034
Anyway, who could she be with?

310
00:19:19,243 --> 00:19:20,702
Some ex-boyfriend, right?

311
00:19:20,786 --> 00:19:23,247
- Could I have a beer, please?|- Rafael...

312
00:19:23,413 --> 00:19:24,873
Non-alcoholic.

313
00:19:25,082 --> 00:19:27,376
It's much better for 1,000 reasons

314
00:19:27,543 --> 00:19:31,296
but I'm not going to list them now|because it isn't the ...

315
00:19:31,463 --> 00:19:33,257
Come on, don't be sad.

316
00:19:33,423 --> 00:19:36,051
I bet you'll be married|by next week.

317
00:19:36,260 --> 00:19:39,513
Or maybe not.|You can't force things.

318
00:19:39,638 --> 00:19:42,391
Don't look at me like that.|But anyway,

319
00:19:42,599 --> 00:19:44,434
come to our place

320
00:19:44,601 --> 00:19:47,855
and I'll look after you|while Pedro goes to Almeria.

321
00:19:49,481 --> 00:19:50,941
Why are you going there?

322
00:19:51,108 --> 00:19:54,361
To check some fossils,|to see if they're Neolithic.

323
00:19:54,528 --> 00:19:57,823
- Why do you have to go?|- It's my specialty.

324
00:19:57,990 --> 00:20:01,535
You think I want to go to Almeria|and not be here to help you?

325
00:20:01,702 --> 00:20:03,745
You're the most important thing|for me.

326
00:20:03,871 --> 00:20:07,332
But it doesn't matter if he goes.|Come to our place,

327
00:20:07,541 --> 00:20:09,334
we'll have a great time together.

328
00:20:09,501 --> 00:20:12,754
But he doesn't really have|to come to our place, does he?

329
00:20:12,921 --> 00:20:15,799
You have to start getting back|to your normal life.

330
00:20:15,966 --> 00:20:17,759
Just one thing, Pedro.

331
00:20:17,926 --> 00:20:18,802
Why Almeria?

332
00:20:19,511 --> 00:20:23,765
There's no Neolithic there.|I mean, there are other things...

333
00:20:23,974 --> 00:20:26,435
- Deserts, cacti, beaches|- Almeria is!

334
00:20:26,643 --> 00:20:27,895
What if I go with you?

335
00:20:28,061 --> 00:20:29,271
I'm going to work.

336
00:20:29,396 --> 00:20:31,106
- I'll help you.|- Don't be so childish.

337
00:20:31,273 --> 00:20:32,983
Go to a hotel, and that's it.

338
00:20:33,150 --> 00:20:35,485
Don't be silly,|he's coming to our place.

339
00:20:35,652 --> 00:20:38,697
Pedro, do what you want|but there's no Neolithic in Almeria.

340
00:20:38,780 --> 00:20:39,865
Where are you going?

341
00:20:40,032 --> 00:20:42,993
- To the area where the washrooms are.|- Me too.

342
00:20:47,372 --> 00:20:50,209
There's no need|for you to come to our place.

343
00:21:01,094 --> 00:21:02,513
He can't fool me.

344
00:21:02,679 --> 00:21:04,932
He set this up|to steal her from me.

345
00:21:05,098 --> 00:21:08,018
He didn't marry Raquel|because he wants Marta.
346
00:21:08,560 --> 00:21:10,521
She's waiting for him in Almeria.

347
00:21:11,355 --> 00:21:13,148
Does he think I'm stupid?

348
00:21:13,357 --> 00:21:15,025
It's just getting worse!

349
00:21:16,777 --> 00:21:18,403
- That's it?|- That's it

350
00:21:23,450 --> 00:21:25,244
He can't fool me.

351
00:21:25,369 --> 00:21:28,080
He's waiting for his chance|to jump on Raquel.

352
00:21:28,288 --> 00:21:30,249
I know him, the bastard.

353
00:21:30,958 --> 00:21:32,334
Well, guys.

354
00:21:33,544 --> 00:21:35,796
A Spanish dick never pisses alone.

355
00:21:45,222 --> 00:21:48,350
I always said that|that couple wasn't...

356
00:21:50,435 --> 00:21:53,689
And when I was joking...|Look, a squashed cat!

357
00:21:53,897 --> 00:21:55,858
When I was joking,|I knew deep down..

358
00:21:55,983 --> 00:21:59,953
Slow down. Better to lose a minute in|your life than your life in a minute.

359
00:22:00,070 --> 00:22:02,030
And to arrive five minutes late|than not at all.

360
00:22:02,197 --> 00:22:04,575
But what I'm trying to say is

361
00:22:04,741 --> 00:22:07,953
it's not just that.|It's the mind, my mind.

362
00:22:08,120 --> 00:22:10,372
- Well, the mind...|- That's it.

363
00:22:10,539 --> 00:22:12,833
Normally we only use 10%

364
00:22:13,000 --> 00:22:15,669
and I feel that I'm using more|and I see more things.

365
00:22:15,836 --> 00:22:17,754
Look.|There's a gas station.

366
00:22:17,921 --> 00:22:20,549
- Pull in, we're low on gas.|- You see?

367
00:22:20,757 --> 00:22:23,552
I was just thinking that|and I hadn't seen the warning light.

368
00:22:23,760 --> 00:22:25,554
- But look, the tank is full.|- Even so...

369
00:22:25,762 --> 00:22:28,056
- A stitch in time saves nine.|- Exactly.
370
00:22:28,265 --> 00:22:30,267
Slow down a bit as you go in,

371
00:22:30,434 --> 00:22:32,936
and let's see if we can shave|a bit closer here.

372
00:22:33,103 --> 00:22:34,229
Yes, sorry.

373
00:22:38,901 --> 00:22:40,319
What was that?

374
00:22:42,404 --> 00:22:44,031
That was a bit of..

375
00:22:44,198 --> 00:22:45,574
That was sputum.

376
00:22:45,741 --> 00:22:47,201
Yes, it was,

377
00:22:48,410 --> 00:22:51,497
but I was just clearing my throat,|it'll never happen again.

378
00:22:51,622 --> 00:22:52,706
I hope not.

379
00:23:37,125 --> 00:23:38,460
Are you crazy?

380
00:23:39,378 --> 00:23:40,838
What are you doing?

381
00:23:41,213 --> 00:23:44,383
I'm getting some tablets,|I've got heartburn.

382
00:23:44,550 --> 00:23:46,218
What the fuck are you doing?

383
00:23:46,385 --> 00:23:49,054
No Neolithic remains|have ever been found in Almeria.

384
00:23:49,221 --> 00:23:52,015
What are you talking about?

385
00:23:52,224 --> 00:23:55,060
- What are you talking about?|- Watch your hands.

386
00:23:55,894 --> 00:23:56,812
Watch your hands.

387
00:24:01,024 --> 00:24:02,276
- What's up?|- What's up?

388
00:24:02,526 --> 00:24:04,486
He's crazy.|He's gone bananas.

389
00:24:04,695 --> 00:24:06,697
Don't be silly.|He's upset.

390
00:24:06,989 --> 00:24:08,198
He's depressed.

391
00:24:08,991 --> 00:24:12,619
But I'll look after him|while you're in Almeria.

392
00:24:13,036 --> 00:24:14,705
- Good night.|- Good night.

393
00:24:20,919 --> 00:24:21,837
What is it?

394
00:24:23,213 --> 00:24:25,299
- I can't sleep.|- And?

395
00:24:25,966 --> 00:24:27,551
I want to sleep here,|move over.

396
00:24:27,926 --> 00:24:30,262
There's no room|and you'll have insomnia here too.

397
00:24:31,096 --> 00:24:32,389
- Thanks a lot!|- Forget it.

398
00:24:32,598 --> 00:24:35,309
- Come on, move over.|- There's no room here.

399
00:24:35,475 --> 00:24:39,563
In that case,|go and sleep in the guest room.

400
00:24:39,897 --> 00:24:40,981
What did you say?

401
00:24:41,064 --> 00:24:44,067
Look at the state he's in.|He needs company.

402
00:24:44,234 --> 00:24:46,695
All right.|The three of us can sleep here.

403
00:24:46,862 --> 00:24:49,156
The bed's enormous.

404
00:24:49,406 --> 00:24:51,658
What are you doing?

405
00:24:51,742 --> 00:24:53,035
I'll make a sacrifice.

406
00:24:53,202 --> 00:24:56,205
I'll get in the middle,|it's the most uncomfortable.

407
00:24:56,413 --> 00:24:58,499
- I hurt myself, Pedro.|- I'm sorry.

408
00:25:00,792 --> 00:25:02,085
Good night, Javier.

409
00:25:13,805 --> 00:25:15,432
Will you hold my hand?

410
00:25:16,266 --> 00:25:17,142
What?

411
00:25:17,226 --> 00:25:18,894
Hold my hand, I feel bad.

412
00:25:21,104 --> 00:25:23,148
Why don't we leave the light on?

413
00:25:23,315 --> 00:25:24,775
Look, can we get to sleep?

414
00:25:25,108 --> 00:25:28,779
I just want someone to hold my hand!|It that so much to ask?
415
00:25:28,946 --> 00:25:31,949
I'm not asking that much either.|I just want the light on.

416
00:25:32,282 --> 00:25:34,910
Pedro, just keep quiet|and hold his hand.

417
00:25:51,593 --> 00:25:53,387
What is it?|What's wrong now?

418
00:25:53,887 --> 00:25:55,639
That's enough!|Swap places with me.

419
00:25:55,764 --> 00:25:56,640
But it was him!

420
00:25:56,890 --> 00:25:59,518
You lie here|or you go to the guest room.

421
00:25:59,685 --> 00:26:01,186
- Come on.|- Unbelievable!

422
00:26:01,311 --> 00:26:02,604
That's it.

423
00:26:02,813 --> 00:26:03,814
We're going to sleep.

424
00:26:03,981 --> 00:26:08,151
He's in my bed, in my house,|and I have to go to the spare room.
425
00:26:08,318 --> 00:26:10,195
- Who'd believe it?|- That's it.
426
00:26:16,702 --> 00:26:19,413
- Can I hold your hand, Raquel?|- Here, you can hold mine.

427
00:26:19,538 --> 00:26:21,456
I'll hold your hand too, Pedro.

428
00:26:26,670 --> 00:26:29,173
Javier, I think you're right.

429
00:26:29,673 --> 00:26:33,385
I don't think I'll find anything|in Almeria. So I'll stay here,

430
00:26:34,011 --> 00:26:35,470
at home.

431
00:26:47,274 --> 00:26:48,692
God!!

432
00:26:52,196 --> 00:26:53,989
Fuck, that must have hurt!

433
00:26:56,241 --> 00:26:57,326
Rafa?

434
00:27:03,624 --> 00:27:04,666
Rafael?

435
00:27:08,128 --> 00:27:10,172
I was just...|Weren't you meeting someone?

436
00:27:10,339 --> 00:27:12,090
Me? No.

437
00:27:13,091 --> 00:27:14,801
- What's that smell?|- My father..

438
00:27:14,968 --> 00:27:18,722
I mean, my father comes here|and he starts smoking..

439
00:27:18,889 --> 00:27:20,390
You know what he's like.

440
00:27:20,516 --> 00:27:22,392
He leaves the TV on and ...

441
00:27:22,559 --> 00:27:24,061
That's easy.

442
00:27:24,228 --> 00:27:25,604
We turn it off.

443
00:27:27,564 --> 00:27:28,815
And what?

444
00:27:31,235 --> 00:27:33,570
- Rafael!|- What do you care? Please.

445
00:27:33,737 --> 00:27:36,198
- Rafael!|- What do you care?

446
00:27:39,243 --> 00:27:41,537
Two don't argue|if one doesn't want to,

447
00:27:41,703 --> 00:27:44,998
but, please, tell your father|he's not to smoke in here.

448
00:27:45,165 --> 00:27:48,669
It won't happen again.|A word to the wise is enough.

449
00:27:48,836 --> 00:27:51,672
Yes, but there's none so deaf|as he who won't hear.

450
00:27:51,880 --> 00:27:52,840
That's true too.

451
00:28:17,781 --> 00:28:19,116
{Y:i}"Dear Diary:

452
00:28:19,283 --> 00:28:21,994
{Y:i}My love is so strong it scares me.

453
00:28:22,161 --> 00:28:24,371
{Y:i}Yesterday when Rafa went to work

454
00:28:24,538 --> 00:28:28,083
{Y:i}I went for a walk with my new love.

455
00:28:28,584 --> 00:28:31,128
{Y:i}We talked about literature,

456
00:28:31,295 --> 00:28:33,255
{Y:i}about cinema, about animals,

457
00:28:33,422 --> 00:28:34,840
{Y:i}about cell phones...

458
00:28:38,802 --> 00:28:40,012
Waken up.

459
00:28:40,804 --> 00:28:42,514
Javier, it's 2:15.

460
00:28:47,978 --> 00:28:49,229
Where's Pedro?

461
00:28:49,855 --> 00:28:51,607
He's in the museum.

462
00:28:51,732 --> 00:28:53,358
Here, have your shower.

463
00:28:54,818 --> 00:28:56,320
Come on, it's late.

464
00:29:00,699 --> 00:29:01,950
Are you all right?

465
00:29:03,660 --> 00:29:04,953
I feel awful.

466
00:29:06,872 --> 00:29:08,832
Don't be like that

467
00:29:10,042 --> 00:29:12,294
You're going to find loads of girls

468
00:29:12,503 --> 00:29:14,505
who'll be crazy to be with you.

469
00:29:16,256 --> 00:29:17,466
Take it easy!

470
00:29:19,510 --> 00:29:20,969
- What's that?|- What?

471
00:29:23,096 --> 00:29:24,139
What are you doing?

472
00:29:24,348 --> 00:29:27,267
- Come to bed with me.|- Why? Are you crazy?

473
00:29:27,434 --> 00:29:28,894
Because I feel bad.

474
00:29:29,478 --> 00:29:31,605
How can you have such a nerve?

475
00:29:32,105 --> 00:29:35,192
If you were feeling bad,|I'd do it for you.

476
00:29:36,527 --> 00:29:38,445
Don't be so selfish.

477
00:29:38,737 --> 00:29:39,905
Selfish?

478
00:29:40,239 --> 00:29:42,950
I bring you into my home, my bed...

479
00:29:43,617 --> 00:29:45,369
- And?|- What more do you want?

480
00:29:46,328 --> 00:29:47,955
I'm telling you.

481
00:29:52,084 --> 00:29:53,418
You're a!

482
00:29:53,919 --> 00:29:55,504
You needn't be like that.

483
00:29:55,754 --> 00:29:57,923
If you don't want to,|just say so.

484
00:30:04,596 --> 00:30:05,722
- Hello.|- Hello.

485
00:30:05,973 --> 00:30:07,558
I wanted a word with you.

486
00:30:07,933 --> 00:30:10,102
Yes, but not now,

487
00:30:10,269 --> 00:30:12,354
- I'm in a hurry.|- Just one second.

488
00:30:12,688 --> 00:30:15,274
This isn't the most romantic place|in the world

489
00:30:15,607 --> 00:30:18,068
but I'll never find one|that's worthy of you.

490
00:30:21,071 --> 00:30:22,781
Will you marry me?

491
00:30:27,661 --> 00:30:28,871
Don't be silly!

492
00:30:32,416 --> 00:30:33,709
It's no big deal.

493
00:30:35,252 --> 00:30:36,253
Pedro!

494
00:30:53,604 --> 00:30:54,730
Here, my love.

495
00:30:56,607 --> 00:30:57,733
You're so mysterious.

496
00:30:57,816 --> 00:30:59,860
I'm getting a sore throat.

497
00:31:24,593 --> 00:31:28,263
{Y:i}Let me pass through the wind|without documents.

498
00:31:28,597 --> 00:31:32,768
{Y:i}I'll do it for the time we had

499
00:31:32,976 --> 00:31:36,855
{Y:i}because there's no way out,|because you seem to be asleep,

500
00:31:37,022 --> 00:31:41,109
{Y:i}because I'd spend my whole life|looking for your smile.

501
00:31:41,276 --> 00:31:45,197
{Y:i}I want to be the only one|who bites your lips.

502
00:31:45,322 --> 00:31:49,451
{Y:i}I want to know that life with you|isn't going to end.

503
00:32:06,426 --> 00:32:09,555
{Y:i}Let me close your eyes tonight

504
00:32:10,264 --> 00:32:12,933
{Y:i}and tomorrow I'll go to bed|with a cigarette

505
00:32:14,726 --> 00:32:16,812
{Y:i}because I've got no other intention

506
00:32:17,020 --> 00:32:19,857
{Y:i}but to keep|drinking from this glass

507
00:32:20,023 --> 00:32:22,526
{Y:i}that isn't so broken.

508
00:32:23,360 --> 00:32:25,863
{Y:i}I want to be the only one who bites

509
00:32:26,196 --> 00:32:27,489
{Y:i}your lips.

510
00:32:27,656 --> 00:32:31,577
{Y:i}I want to know that life with you|isn't going to end.

511
00:32:31,743 --> 00:32:33,370
{Y:i}Just because! Just because!

512
00:32:33,537 --> 00:32:35,038
{Y:i}Because in this life

513
00:32:35,372 --> 00:32:38,417
{Y:i}I don't want to spend|a whole day without you.

514
00:32:39,877 --> 00:32:41,879
{Y:i}Just because!|Just because! Just because!

515
00:32:42,045 --> 00:32:43,172
{Y:i}Because while I'm waiting

516
00:32:43,547 --> 00:32:46,675
{Y:i}I die for you|and I don't want to live like this.

517
00:32:50,137 --> 00:32:51,597
Pilar! Pili!

518
00:32:51,763 --> 00:32:53,807
Look what some idiot|left in the taxi.

519
00:32:57,394 --> 00:32:59,438
- What are you doing here?|- And you?

520
00:32:59,563 --> 00:33:01,690
I brought you this thing.

521
00:33:02,399 --> 00:33:04,526
I'm glad you're here, Carlos.

522
00:33:04,735 --> 00:33:08,197
- We can have supper together.|- It's lovely, I'll put it away.

523
00:33:08,405 --> 00:33:10,699
Never look a gift horse|in the mouth.

524
00:33:14,077 --> 00:33:15,204
It's a lie.

525
00:33:15,412 --> 00:33:16,955
- I bought it.|- What?

526
00:33:17,122 --> 00:33:20,125
The umbrella. I came to see|if I'd catch her with someone else.

527
00:33:24,254 --> 00:33:27,382
She's with someone, someone else,|someone who's not me.

528
00:33:28,509 --> 00:33:31,053
I need you to be my right hand.|Understand?

529
00:33:31,261 --> 00:33:33,722
You're the only person|I can trust. Why?

530
00:33:33,931 --> 00:33:37,559
Well, today you're going to stay|and sleep in the fold-up bed.

531
00:33:37,726 --> 00:33:40,270
- It's very comfortable.|- You needn't bother...

532
00:33:45,984 --> 00:33:47,402
There's one vital thing.

533
00:33:47,569 --> 00:33:50,739
Pay attention to the...|to all the...

534
00:33:51,698 --> 00:33:55,244
things that might seem like sparks|to you, that you mightn't...

535
00:33:55,410 --> 00:33:58,247
You say there's nothing.|There is, Carlos, there is!

536
00:33:58,455 --> 00:34:01,250
With my mind, I'm going to find|the most hidden clues.

537
00:34:01,416 --> 00:34:03,377
I'm asking you, please.|Understand?

538
00:34:06,713 --> 00:34:09,049
Hey, listen, sweetheart,

539
00:34:09,216 --> 00:34:12,177
Carlos says he's got builders|in his house, or something,

540
00:34:12,386 --> 00:34:15,222
and he wants to stay here.|- To sleep? Yes, of course.

541
00:34:15,430 --> 00:34:17,182
Stay as long as you want.

542
00:34:17,432 --> 00:34:20,102
I told you,|a week, two, four...

543
00:34:20,269 --> 00:34:23,939
So, when I'm out|he can keep you company, right?

544
00:34:24,106 --> 00:34:26,191
Exactly.|Take down the garbage.

545
00:34:26,358 --> 00:34:28,986
Yes. Right away, love.

546
00:34:46,461 --> 00:34:47,588
Hey, miss!

547
00:34:49,090 --> 00:34:51,592
Sorry! Keep the change.

548
00:34:53,302 --> 00:34:55,596
Tell me,|what symptoms do you have?

549
00:34:57,139 --> 00:34:58,265
I feel terrible.

550
00:34:59,141 --> 00:35:02,477
- I've got a pain here.|- That looks very bad.

551
00:35:02,686 --> 00:35:06,273
- I'll have to examine you.|- Shall I take off my blouse?

552
00:35:06,440 --> 00:35:08,275
No. That isn't necessary.

553
00:35:08,442 --> 00:35:09,568
Get on the couch.

554
00:35:14,072 --> 00:35:15,741
Well, open your mouth.
555
00:35:16,408 --> 00:35:18,994
No, my throat doesn't hurt.

556
00:35:19,536 --> 00:35:21,079
The pain seems to be here.
557
00:35:21,580 --> 00:35:23,582
Who's the doctor, you or I?
558
00:35:23,749 --> 00:35:25,292
I'm sorry,

559
00:35:25,751 --> 00:35:27,503
I'm very nervous because

560
00:35:29,004 --> 00:35:30,756
I left my boyfriend today.

561
00:35:35,010 --> 00:35:35,928
Am I very ill?

562
00:35:36,053 --> 00:35:37,971
You're very bad.

563
00:35:38,180 --> 00:35:41,266
- Take off your blouse, please.|- I told you so.

564
00:35:41,433 --> 00:35:43,393
Are you sure about what you did?

565
00:35:43,852 --> 00:35:45,854
Totally, I think.

566
00:35:46,939 --> 00:35:48,440
I feel sorry for my boyfriend

567
00:35:48,607 --> 00:35:51,193
because he's really cute|and he loves me

568
00:35:52,444 --> 00:35:54,905
but I think I'm in love|with someone else.

569
00:35:57,616 --> 00:35:58,700
Who?

570
00:35:59,952 --> 00:36:01,578
A wicked doctor.

571
00:36:02,412 --> 00:36:04,540
Well, really she's just an intem

572
00:36:04,665 --> 00:36:06,875
and she never gets|a diagnosis right.

573
00:36:08,335 --> 00:36:09,378
Can I be cured?

574
00:36:10,420 --> 00:36:11,755
Well,

575
00:36:11,964 --> 00:36:14,049
it's too early to say

576
00:36:15,259 --> 00:36:17,928
but I'll give you|a thorough examination.

577
00:36:20,597 --> 00:36:22,724
You kill yourself|to make them happy

578
00:36:22,933 --> 00:36:24,726
and what thanks do you get?

579
00:36:25,936 --> 00:36:28,772
I've been thinking about it|all afternoon

580
00:36:28,939 --> 00:36:30,440
and it's just as well.

581
00:36:30,607 --> 00:36:31,733
What's just as well?

582
00:36:31,942 --> 00:36:35,737
It's just as well, because|we weren't going anywhere.

583
00:36:35,946 --> 00:36:39,992
Marriage, mortgage, job, children,|you get old and you die.

584
00:36:40,159 --> 00:36:41,285
- What's that?|- Nothing.

585
00:36:41,410 --> 00:36:43,078
That's not life.

586
00:36:44,037 --> 00:36:45,414
Life is something else

587
00:36:45,622 --> 00:36:47,583
and we're starting to enjoy it now.

588
00:36:47,749 --> 00:36:50,752
We're both here now, relaxed,

589
00:36:50,961 --> 00:36:53,088
with no pressure,|talking about life.

590
00:36:53,172 --> 00:36:55,340
That's true.|We're in fucking heaven here!

591
00:36:55,674 --> 00:36:56,592
Just you and I.

592
00:36:56,758 --> 00:36:58,927
You and I,|like it's always been.

593
00:37:01,263 --> 00:37:02,306
Do you know

594
00:37:03,307 --> 00:37:04,266
there was

595
00:37:04,975 --> 00:37:08,353
a second when I thought|you were keen on Marta?

596
00:37:12,983 --> 00:37:14,276
You know what?

597
00:37:14,485 --> 00:37:17,571
I was sure you were going|to try it on with Raquel.

598
00:37:18,739 --> 00:37:19,865
What do you mean?

599
00:37:21,074 --> 00:37:23,952
I don't think|that's the least bit funny.

600
00:37:24,161 --> 00:37:26,580
- Don't you know me?|- I'm sorry.

601
00:37:27,581 --> 00:37:28,665
I'm sorry.

602
00:37:29,208 --> 00:37:30,125
Forget it.

603
00:37:30,334 --> 00:37:31,543
They're idiots.

604
00:37:31,710 --> 00:37:34,463
Don't they realize|what they're losing?

605
00:37:35,631 --> 00:37:36,798
I'm telling you now.

606
00:37:37,007 --> 00:37:38,383
They're going to come

607
00:37:38,550 --> 00:37:40,719
crying and begging.

608
00:37:40,886 --> 00:37:43,805
I want to see that.|Then we'll see what's what.

609
00:37:43,889 --> 00:37:47,476
They're going to come back|but I'm through with them.

610
00:37:47,643 --> 00:37:49,853
Do you know the life|that's ahead of us?

611
00:37:50,312 --> 00:37:52,064
- Screwing all the time.|- Right.

612
00:37:55,609 --> 00:37:56,568
Who with?

613
00:37:58,570 --> 00:38:00,906
{Y:i}Hello, this is Raquel.|Leave a message.

614
00:38:01,615 --> 00:38:04,243
{Y:i}Drinking,

615
00:38:04,576 --> 00:38:08,622
{Y:i}I spend the whole day drinking,

616
00:38:08,789 --> 00:38:12,960
{Y:i}with the cocktail shaker

617
00:38:14,086 --> 00:38:16,964
{Y:i}full of soda

618
00:38:17,506 --> 00:38:21,510
{Y:i}and vermouth.

619
00:38:33,230 --> 00:38:34,773
It's the groom!

620
00:38:34,940 --> 00:38:35,941
Carlota!

621
00:38:36,108 --> 00:38:37,025
How are you?

622
00:38:37,943 --> 00:38:40,028
Very well.|Want a drink?

623
00:38:40,237 --> 00:38:41,196
Sure.

624
00:38:42,239 --> 00:38:45,117
- I'll have the same as you.|- Same again, please..

625
00:38:47,661 --> 00:38:49,746
Well, Pedro,|how was the wedding?

626
00:38:49,913 --> 00:38:50,914
Javier.

627
00:38:53,083 --> 00:38:54,126
Sorry!

628
00:38:54,918 --> 00:38:56,086
How was it?

629
00:38:56,253 --> 00:39:00,382
In the end I didn't get married.|I'm more of a lone wolf.

630
00:39:01,466 --> 00:39:02,509
She left you.

631
00:39:04,428 --> 00:39:05,554
Yes.

632
00:39:06,263 --> 00:39:07,556
She left you?

633
00:39:10,434 --> 00:39:11,602
And it was hard.

634
00:39:11,768 --> 00:39:14,271
After years of struggling|for that relationship...

635
00:39:15,814 --> 00:39:17,566
I'm really sorry.

636
00:39:17,774 --> 00:39:19,526
But you look great.

637
00:39:20,611 --> 00:39:23,071
- I'm delighted to see you here.|- No, wait.

638
00:39:23,238 --> 00:39:24,907
The truth is,

639
00:39:26,074 --> 00:39:27,451
I came to see you.

640
00:39:28,827 --> 00:39:29,661
What?

641
00:39:30,454 --> 00:39:31,580
I came to see you.

642
00:39:34,374 --> 00:39:36,335
How did you know I was here?

643
00:39:36,502 --> 00:39:39,755
Well, I didn't,|but as I had to see Raquel too...

644
00:39:40,464 --> 00:39:42,925
Anyway, the fact is|I'm glad you're here.

645
00:39:44,801 --> 00:39:45,594
Why?

646
00:39:46,803 --> 00:39:48,805
Because the other day you said

647
00:39:48,972 --> 00:39:51,099
some very intelligent things.

648
00:39:51,767 --> 00:39:52,768
I did?

649
00:39:53,727 --> 00:39:55,145
What things?

650
00:40:01,151 --> 00:40:02,486
Do you like my perfume?

651
00:40:02,653 --> 00:40:04,279
Yes, I love it.

652
00:40:06,573 --> 00:40:08,784
What intelligent things did I say?

653
00:40:10,494 --> 00:40:12,120
I don't remember!

654
00:40:14,665 --> 00:40:17,459
- You're very intelligent too.|- Yeah, well,

655
00:40:17,835 --> 00:40:21,004
you have to pull yourself together.|Life goes on.

656
00:40:21,171 --> 00:40:23,298
- Yes.|- I stopped believing in love.

657
00:40:23,382 --> 00:40:24,383
Really?

658
00:40:24,716 --> 00:40:26,969
And it's a pity|to lose that innocence.

659
00:40:27,678 --> 00:40:30,138
It's doing me good to talk to you.

660
00:40:30,347 --> 00:40:31,431
Thank you.

661
00:40:31,598 --> 00:40:34,393
But I don't really like talking..

662
00:40:34,560 --> 00:40:36,311
I've got a better remedy.

663
00:40:36,770 --> 00:40:37,688
Dancing.

664
00:40:38,021 --> 00:40:40,023
You mean right now?

665
00:40:40,190 --> 00:40:41,483
No, I go to dance classes.

666
00:40:41,692 --> 00:40:43,235
You don't say!

667
00:40:43,402 --> 00:40:44,486
I adore dancing.

668
00:40:44,862 --> 00:40:46,029
- No!|- Yes.

669
00:40:46,196 --> 00:40:47,406
What kind of dancing?

670
00:40:47,614 --> 00:40:48,699
Classical dancing,

671
00:40:49,032 --> 00:40:50,909
modern dancing,|ballroom dancing...

672
00:40:51,410 --> 00:40:53,287
- Which do you prefer?|- Modern.

673
00:40:53,453 --> 00:40:55,455
Really? Just like me!

674
00:40:55,664 --> 00:40:56,999
What school do you go to?

675
00:40:57,166 --> 00:40:59,084
Right now, to none,|but I could go to yours.

676
00:40:59,251 --> 00:41:00,502
Why not?

677
00:41:00,669 --> 00:41:02,504
Heavens! Of course.

678
00:41:03,297 --> 00:41:04,298
Why not?

679
00:41:14,933 --> 00:41:17,269
I'm the melon boy.

680
00:41:30,073 --> 00:41:32,284
{Y:i}To be happy I want a truck.

681
00:41:33,035 --> 00:41:35,787
{Y:i}To be happy I want a truck.

682
00:41:36,205 --> 00:41:37,706
{Y:i}Spitting on the urban dwellers,

683
00:41:37,915 --> 00:41:39,166
{Y:i}feeling up my girl.

684
00:41:39,291 --> 00:41:41,835
{Y:i}To be happy I want a truck.

685
00:41:42,211 --> 00:41:44,713
{Y:i}To be happy I want a melon.

686
00:41:45,380 --> 00:41:47,883
{Y:i}To be happy I want a melon.

687
00:41:49,426 --> 00:41:52,429
I'm the melon boy!

688
00:41:52,596 --> 00:41:54,681
The melon boy!

689
00:41:55,974 --> 00:41:57,476
I'm the melon boy!

690
00:42:04,441 --> 00:42:07,486
Wait, wait, it's all right.

691
00:42:07,986 --> 00:42:09,988
It's a trial, an experiment.

692
00:42:10,322 --> 00:42:12,741
No, really, as a good person.

693
00:42:12,908 --> 00:42:15,702
Listen to me, as a good person.

694
00:42:18,121 --> 00:42:19,248
Carlota?

695
00:42:20,374 --> 00:42:22,125
What are you doing here?

696
00:42:24,044 --> 00:42:26,964
Hello, Pedro, how are you?|Has your girlfriend left you too?

697
00:42:27,798 --> 00:42:29,675
Yes, and it's not funny.

698
00:42:29,842 --> 00:42:30,592
No.

699
00:42:31,468 --> 00:42:32,553
It's not.

700
00:42:33,804 --> 00:42:34,888
I'm sorry.

701
00:42:36,348 --> 00:42:38,183
But that makes three of us.

702
00:42:39,935 --> 00:42:42,980
But we've discovered|a fantastic remedy.

703
00:42:44,606 --> 00:42:45,983
Come with us to dance classes.

704
00:42:46,191 --> 00:42:48,485
No, Pedro doesn't like dancing.

705
00:42:48,652 --> 00:42:50,737
What's this about dancing?

706
00:42:50,904 --> 00:42:51,864
Nothing.

707
00:42:52,030 --> 00:42:55,659
Javier and I were talking|and discovered we both love dancing.

708
00:42:56,034 --> 00:42:57,911
- Isn't that a coincidence?|- Yes,

709
00:42:58,120 --> 00:43:00,581
it certainly is.|Javier has never liked dancing.

710
00:43:00,831 --> 00:43:02,749
- No?|- What do you mean?

711
00:43:02,916 --> 00:43:05,460
Don't tell lies.|I dance all day long.

712
00:43:05,669 --> 00:43:08,130
I'm going to sign up too|because I do like dancing..

713
00:43:08,463 --> 00:43:10,424
Oh, yeah?|Let's see, dance a bit.

714
00:43:10,591 --> 00:43:12,801
You dance a bit|if you like it so much.

715
00:43:13,010 --> 00:43:16,138
- I'll sign up tomorrow.|- There are no places left.

716
00:43:16,346 --> 00:43:19,308
Yes, there are places

717
00:43:19,474 --> 00:43:21,476
Would you like a drink?

718
00:43:21,685 --> 00:43:24,563
Yes, I'll have a drink.|I'll be right back.

719
00:43:26,523 --> 00:43:28,650
You don't know him.

720
00:43:29,985 --> 00:43:32,738
Since his girlfriend left him|he's a wreck.

721
00:43:32,946 --> 00:43:34,323
Why did she leave him?

722
00:43:35,782 --> 00:43:38,785
Basically because he's so envious.

723
00:43:39,036 --> 00:43:42,039
You saw what happened|about the dancing..

724
00:43:42,206 --> 00:43:43,999
He copied me.

725
00:43:44,208 --> 00:43:45,334
He envies you?

726
00:43:47,044 --> 00:43:48,545
It's oozing out of him.

727
00:43:49,755 --> 00:43:50,714
Why?

728
00:43:50,923 --> 00:43:53,509
It's to do with structure,|because of women.

729
00:43:55,302 --> 00:43:57,304
But your girlfriend left you too.

730
00:43:57,638 --> 00:43:59,640
Yes, but I'm coping much better.

731
00:43:59,890 --> 00:44:03,644
I don't want to turn you against him|or criticize him, but he's...

732
00:44:08,106 --> 00:44:11,026
- I'd love a drink.|- So would I.

733
00:44:11,193 --> 00:44:12,486
Will you get them, Javier?

734
00:44:12,611 --> 00:44:14,613
Will you get them, Javier?

735
00:44:14,780 --> 00:44:16,532
- Gin and tonic.|- Same here.

736
00:44:19,535 --> 00:44:21,995
- Could I have a slice of lemon?|- Sure.

737
00:44:22,162 --> 00:44:24,790
Could I have|three ice cubes, please?

738
00:44:27,960 --> 00:44:29,920
Pedro, don't be angry with us.

739
00:44:30,087 --> 00:44:31,880
I'm not, it isn't that.

740
00:44:32,047 --> 00:44:35,509
I had a dream,|well, more of a nightmare.

741
00:44:36,343 --> 00:44:37,511
- Yeah?|- Yeah.

742
00:44:38,846 --> 00:44:40,305
Javier's girlfriend.

743
00:44:40,430 --> 00:44:41,723
She jilted him.

744
00:44:42,891 --> 00:44:45,561
I dreamed she was a lesbian.

745
00:44:45,727 --> 00:44:46,728
Fuck!

746
00:44:48,522 --> 00:44:49,481
And yours?

747
00:44:49,606 --> 00:44:51,692
No, no, mine isn't.

748
00:44:55,529 --> 00:44:56,530
Mine isn't.

749
00:44:57,948 --> 00:45:01,076
Why don't we go out somewhere|for the last drink?

750
00:45:01,243 --> 00:45:03,704
- Sure, or the second last.|- All right.

751
00:45:09,793 --> 00:45:11,795
- What's up?|- We're going out for a drink.

752
00:45:11,962 --> 00:45:13,755
Now? But it's fine here.

753
00:45:13,964 --> 00:45:15,090
Well, you stay here.

754
00:45:15,174 --> 00:45:16,592
No, come on.

755
00:45:19,636 --> 00:45:20,971
Where are we going?

756
00:45:21,638 --> 00:45:23,682
I don't know. Wherever.

757
00:45:26,643 --> 00:45:28,645
{Y:i}We'll race through the streets,

758
00:45:28,812 --> 00:45:30,772
{Y:i}kick up a fuss|when no one's around.

759
00:45:30,981 --> 00:45:32,441
{Y:i}I don't want to sleep.

760
00:45:33,150 --> 00:45:34,735
{Y:i}I don't want to sleep.

761
00:45:35,819 --> 00:45:37,905
{Y:i}Some don't get it|and punch everybody.

762
00:45:38,071 --> 00:45:39,948
{Y:i}Someone's leaping|over the rooftops.

763
00:45:40,115 --> 00:45:41,658
{Y:i}He won't sleep anymore.

764
00:45:42,201 --> 00:45:44,369
{Y:i}He won't sleep anymore.

765
00:45:44,995 --> 00:45:49,041
{Y:i}And at night,|we'll do the usual stuff

766
00:45:54,171 --> 00:45:58,008
{Y:i}because we like it|and because it's fun.
767
00:46:02,721 --> 00:46:04,640
{Y:i}She's passed out,|she works too hard.

768
00:46:04,848 --> 00:46:07,142
{Y:i}She's in a hurry|and wants to go far.

769
00:46:07,309 --> 00:46:08,477
{Y:i}She can't sleep.

770
00:46:09,436 --> 00:46:11,730
{Y:i}She can't sleep.

771
00:46:11,939 --> 00:46:14,066
{Y:i}He said he was leaving|but he's still here.

772
00:46:14,274 --> 00:46:16,276
{Y:i}One whole night|with the same story.

773
00:46:16,485 --> 00:46:18,028
{Y:i}He doesn't know how to sleep.

774
00:46:18,320 --> 00:46:20,239
{Y:i}He doesn't know how to sleep.

775
00:46:20,697 --> 00:46:24,952
{Y:i}And at night|we'll do the usual stuff

776
00:46:29,998 --> 00:46:34,127
{Y:i}because we like it|and because it's fun.

777
00:46:57,109 --> 00:46:59,319
{Y:i}You bite the pillow,|cling to the bed.

778
00:46:59,486 --> 00:47:01,446
{Y:i}The bed is empty,|the light is out.

779
00:47:01,572 --> 00:47:03,866
{Y:i}You want to sleep.

780
00:47:04,032 --> 00:47:05,659
{Y:i}You want to sleep.

781
00:47:05,826 --> 00:47:07,703
{Y:i}We're waiting|for our friend to come.

782
00:47:07,870 --> 00:47:10,330
{Y:i}He sleeps a lot|and knows what he's doing.

783
00:47:10,497 --> 00:47:11,874
{Y:i}He likes to sleep.

784
00:47:12,249 --> 00:47:14,960
{Y:i}He likes to sleep.

785
00:47:15,627 --> 00:47:19,381
{Y:i}And at night|we'll do the usual stuff

786
00:47:24,428 --> 00:47:28,390
{Y:i}because we like it|and because it's fun.

787
00:47:33,437 --> 00:47:37,566
{Y:i}And at night|we'll do the usual stuff.

788
00:48:19,608 --> 00:48:20,484
Come on.

789
00:48:21,068 --> 00:48:22,736
You'll waken her.

790
00:49:24,423 --> 00:49:26,466
You're a nervous spirit!

791
00:49:26,633 --> 00:49:29,011
Come here, come here.

792
00:49:29,595 --> 00:49:33,390
You have to control your nerves|even in the most extreme situations!

793
00:49:34,600 --> 00:49:35,893
The mind.

794
00:49:39,855 --> 00:49:43,233
"Dear Diary: I don't know where|this unbridled passion will lead me

795
00:49:43,400 --> 00:49:47,362
but I have to live it,|feel it, enjoy it... "

796
00:49:51,658 --> 00:49:53,076
That's how things are.

797
00:49:54,661 --> 00:49:57,331
Do you still not know|who it could be?

798
00:49:57,498 --> 00:49:59,374
Maybe some ex-boyfriend...

799
00:49:59,583 --> 00:50:02,044
She's smart, she's so smart.

800
00:50:02,211 --> 00:50:05,589
She never mentions|his name anywhere, just O.

801
00:50:05,756 --> 00:50:07,549
Who can it be?

802
00:50:10,427 --> 00:50:12,221
My mind is talking to me.

803
00:50:13,514 --> 00:50:14,765
I'm going to leave her.

804
00:50:14,932 --> 00:50:16,892
No, no, Carlos.

805
00:50:17,100 --> 00:50:19,436
Don't insist.|You won't convince me.

806
00:50:19,645 --> 00:50:21,021
I'm going to leave her.

807
00:50:21,188 --> 00:50:23,023
Look, Carlos,|one thing, one "item".

808
00:50:23,190 --> 00:50:26,068
No one messes me around,|I mean, like, no one!

809
00:50:27,027 --> 00:50:30,531
I'll leave her, she'll come crawling|and then we'll see.

810
00:50:31,824 --> 00:50:33,700
I'd ask you one thing, my friend.

811
00:50:33,867 --> 00:50:37,496
Don't let me weaken, please,|because I'm very sentimental.

812
00:50:37,663 --> 00:50:38,705
You know that.

813
00:50:42,459 --> 00:50:44,753
You're dressing very well recently.

814
00:51:07,818 --> 00:51:08,819
Hello?

815
00:51:17,161 --> 00:51:18,245
Marta?

816
00:51:28,755 --> 00:51:29,715
Well!

817
00:51:32,342 --> 00:51:34,469
- How nice.|- What do you want?

818
00:51:34,678 --> 00:51:37,222
I'm taking dancing classes.

819
00:51:38,098 --> 00:51:40,434
The dance school is near here,

820
00:51:40,601 --> 00:51:41,810
in Tudescos,

821
00:51:42,811 --> 00:51:45,189
and I just wanted to see you.

822
00:51:45,355 --> 00:51:47,900
Wait in the sitting room,|I'll be out now.

823
00:51:48,025 --> 00:51:51,945
- Maybe we rushed things a bit.|- What's that?

824
00:51:52,112 --> 00:51:53,113
- What?|- That.

825
00:51:54,656 --> 00:51:55,449
This?

826
00:51:55,532 --> 00:51:56,783
No, not that!

827
00:51:57,493 --> 00:51:58,452
Nothing.

828
00:52:01,121 --> 00:52:02,581
What I mean is

829
00:52:02,789 --> 00:52:05,459
things are never perfect

830
00:52:05,667 --> 00:52:08,420
- and people have to hang on.|- Yes, hang on.

831
00:52:08,545 --> 00:52:09,338
Just hang on!

832
00:52:09,505 --> 00:52:11,590
- And talk things through.|- Yes.

833
00:52:12,466 --> 00:52:14,468
Well, we've talked it all through.

834
00:52:14,676 --> 00:52:16,512
Fix some drinks|and we'll celebrate.

835
00:52:16,678 --> 00:52:19,014
I feel something very special|for you.

836
00:52:19,181 --> 00:52:21,266
I've never loved anyone|like I love you.
837
00:52:21,391 --> 00:52:25,312
I think you were right|in what you said about hanging on.

838
00:52:25,479 --> 00:52:27,356
You have to hang on.

839
00:52:27,523 --> 00:52:29,691
But it's not only that.

840
00:52:29,858 --> 00:52:32,152
Leave me alone for a moment,|I want to think about it.

841
00:52:32,319 --> 00:52:33,278
What if I get in...

842
00:52:34,446 --> 00:52:35,697
Pick up the phone!

843
00:52:37,407 --> 00:52:39,034
It isn't ringing.

844
00:52:40,369 --> 00:52:44,665
Love, if you don't want|to marry me, it's all right.

845
00:52:44,790 --> 00:52:48,794
Of course it's all right.|Fix me a drink, please.

846
00:52:48,961 --> 00:52:51,672
I want to know if you're willing|to start over again.

847
00:52:51,839 --> 00:52:54,925
No, not start over again.|Hang on. Hang on!

848
00:52:58,637 --> 00:53:00,097
Hello, Javier!

849
00:53:02,933 --> 00:53:06,019
Don't look like that,|nothing's happened.

850
00:53:06,186 --> 00:53:09,606
I told her not to come out because|I knew you'd get the wrong idea.

851
00:53:09,773 --> 00:53:10,941
And you did, didn't you?

852
00:53:25,414 --> 00:53:26,790
Bitches...

853
00:53:34,464 --> 00:53:36,425
You're crazy!

854
00:53:36,967 --> 00:53:38,093
Murderer!

855
00:53:38,302 --> 00:53:40,262
Do you want to kill me?|Do you?

856
00:53:54,943 --> 00:53:58,071
They were just bathing together.|It means nothing.

857
00:54:00,324 --> 00:54:02,951
She was taking a hair|out of her mouth.

858
00:54:03,660 --> 00:54:05,996
I do that too sometimes.

859
00:54:08,123 --> 00:54:11,084
She had her head there,|right there.

860
00:54:12,169 --> 00:54:15,964
Of all the women in the world,|those two had to have an affair.

861
00:54:28,519 --> 00:54:30,229
I don't want to go in!

862
00:54:34,107 --> 00:54:36,235
It was the worst thing|I've ever seen.

863
00:54:36,401 --> 00:54:39,947
She pretended to be looking after me|and she was screwing my girlfriend!

864
00:54:40,113 --> 00:54:42,157
I bet it was|innocent little Marta who...

865
00:54:42,366 --> 00:54:44,159
And what were you doing?

866
00:54:44,368 --> 00:54:46,578
You should have had|your eyes open!

867
00:54:46,745 --> 00:54:49,289
And your fixation|for getting married?

868
00:54:53,752 --> 00:54:56,505
{Y:i}How could you do this to me?

869
00:54:56,630 --> 00:54:59,925
{Y:i}I'd have loved you to the end.

870
00:55:00,467 --> 00:55:02,594
{Y:i}I know you'll be sorry.

871
00:55:04,137 --> 00:55:07,474
{Y:i}Whose business is it|what I do?

872
00:55:08,141 --> 00:55:10,811
{Y:i}Whose business is it|what I say?

873
00:55:11,145 --> 00:55:13,522
{Y:i}This is how I am|and I'll stay like this.

874
00:55:13,689 --> 00:55:15,774
{Y:i}I'll never change.

875
00:55:16,984 --> 00:55:20,779
{Y:i}What dirty, treacherous grief.

876
00:55:22,322 --> 00:55:27,161
{Y:i}It's poisoning my heart.

877
00:55:28,537 --> 00:55:33,333
{Y:i}I know that she never went crazy

878
00:55:33,500 --> 00:55:34,960
{Y:i}and never lost control.

879
00:55:35,085 --> 00:55:37,880
{Y:i}Leave me.

880
00:55:38,714 --> 00:55:41,175
{Y:i}It's senseless now.

881
00:55:41,300 --> 00:55:43,844
{Y:i}It's best

882
00:55:45,554 --> 00:55:48,390
{Y:i}if you go your way

883
00:55:48,599 --> 00:55:51,560
{Y:i}and I go mine.

884
00:55:52,603 --> 00:55:53,896
{Y:i}No.

885
00:55:54,104 --> 00:55:56,940
{Y:i}So leave me now.

886
00:55:57,107 --> 00:56:02,279
{Y:i}She never swore her love for me.

887
00:56:05,324 --> 00:56:08,243
{Y:i}I believed it was eternal.

888
00:56:09,620 --> 00:56:13,081
{Y:i}And she smiled at me

889
00:56:13,248 --> 00:56:15,626
{Y:i}and looked out at the sea.

890
00:56:15,792 --> 00:56:18,462
{Y:i}What a bore, what a bore!

891
00:56:18,629 --> 00:56:21,507
{Y:i}Always thinking of the past.

892
00:56:21,673 --> 00:56:24,593
{Y:i}Don't think too much about it,

893
00:56:24,801 --> 00:56:27,638
{Y:i}life is waiting for you.

894
00:56:27,804 --> 00:56:29,264
{Y:i}Get out of here.

895
00:56:29,431 --> 00:56:31,891
{Y:i}You didn't understand me.

896
00:56:32,867 --> 00:56:35,070
{Y:i}I only think about your skin.

897
00:56:35,945 --> 00:56:39,440
{Y:i}You don't have to lie.

898
00:56:40,233 --> 00:56:44,093
It's so easy|to torture yourself afterwards.

899
00:56:44,946 --> 00:56:50,618
{Y:i}But I'll survive.|I know I can. I'll survive.

900
00:56:53,829 --> 00:56:57,207
{Y:i}Where's our mistake|that can't be fixed?

901
00:56:57,415 --> 00:57:00,627
{Y:i}You were the guilty one, not I.

902
00:57:00,752 --> 00:57:04,422
{Y:i}Neither you nor anyone|can change me.

903
00:57:04,548 --> 00:57:07,884
{Y:i}A thousand bells|are ringing in my heart.

904
00:57:08,176 --> 00:57:11,263
{Y:i}It's so hard|to say you're sorry.

905
00:57:11,971 --> 00:57:15,808
{Y:i}Neither you nor anyone|can change me.

906
00:57:17,644 --> 00:57:20,438
{Y:i}Where's our mistake|that can't be fixed?

907
00:57:20,688 --> 00:57:23,941
{Y:i}You were the guilty one, not I.

908
00:57:24,650 --> 00:57:28,112
{Y:i}Neither you nor anyone|can change me.

909
00:57:28,279 --> 00:57:31,574
{Y:i}A thousand bells|are ringing in my heart.

910
00:57:31,740 --> 00:57:35,286
{Y:i}It's so hard|to say you're sorry.

911
00:57:35,994 --> 00:57:39,206
{Y:i}Neither you nor anyone|can change me,

912
00:57:39,373 --> 00:57:40,749
{Y:i}can change me,

913
00:57:40,916 --> 00:57:42,209
{Y:i}can change me,

914
00:57:42,542 --> 00:57:44,127
{Y:i}can change me,

915
00:57:57,811 --> 00:57:59,146
Wait!

916
00:58:02,357 --> 00:58:04,485
I don't know what to say.

917
00:58:05,569 --> 00:58:06,528
Well...

918
00:58:07,488 --> 00:58:10,282
My girlfriend is sleeping|with his girlfriend.

919
00:58:12,409 --> 00:58:13,744
This isn't life.

920
00:58:15,329 --> 00:58:16,788
Life is something else.

921
00:58:17,748 --> 00:58:19,416
Now what do I do?

922
00:58:20,918 --> 00:58:23,378
If you want,|we'll have dinner tomorrow.

923
00:58:23,545 --> 00:58:24,713
What?

924
00:58:26,548 --> 00:58:28,383
Stay out of this.

925
00:58:28,550 --> 00:58:30,344
- You can't do it on your own.|- Says who?

926
00:58:30,511 --> 00:58:31,470
- What time?|- I don't know..

927
00:58:31,637 --> 00:58:33,305
- At 9:00?|- What do you mean, at 9:00?

928
00:58:33,472 --> 00:58:34,473
At 9:00.

929
00:58:35,307 --> 00:58:36,350
At 9:00.

930
00:59:02,209 --> 00:59:05,170
Help me if I start to weaken.|I know her

931
00:59:05,295 --> 00:59:08,340
and when I tell her my decision|she'll be shattered

932
00:59:08,507 --> 00:59:10,676
and she'll start crying|and then I'II...

933
00:59:10,801 --> 00:59:12,553
But I have to... right.

934
00:59:14,263 --> 00:59:15,097
There she is.

935
00:59:15,597 --> 00:59:19,226
Now you'll see if an ox shits|more than a thousand pigeons.

936
00:59:20,394 --> 00:59:21,645
- Hello.|- Hello

937
00:59:21,812 --> 00:59:23,188
I'm Carlos

938
00:59:23,355 --> 00:59:24,231
He's Rafael.

939
00:59:25,440 --> 00:59:26,608
This is Gema,

940
00:59:27,317 --> 00:59:28,277
my cousin.

941
00:59:28,443 --> 00:59:30,237
I've mentioned her loads of times.

942
00:59:30,404 --> 00:59:32,281
- How many?|- Lots.

943
00:59:32,447 --> 00:59:34,867
Once watching TV, and then|on the stairs, and in the car.

944
00:59:35,033 --> 00:59:37,452
- More than ten times?|- Exactly ten times.

945
00:59:37,619 --> 00:59:39,246
Pilar, I have to talk to you.

946
00:59:39,413 --> 00:59:40,414
What about?

947
00:59:40,497 --> 00:59:42,666
Personal things.

948
00:59:42,958 --> 00:59:45,085
What a coincidence.|So do I.

949
00:59:45,752 --> 00:59:47,629
- You know I loved you a lot.|- Right.

950
00:59:47,838 --> 00:59:48,714
Well, I still do,

951
00:59:48,881 --> 00:59:51,383
because true affection|can't be bought or sold

952
00:59:51,508 --> 00:59:53,093
or paid for with money.|- Right.

953
00:59:53,302 --> 00:59:54,136
What?

954
00:59:54,261 --> 00:59:56,638
But the flame of love is..

955
00:59:59,183 --> 01:00:00,476
We're going to split up.

956
01:00:00,601 --> 01:00:01,351
What?

957
01:00:01,518 --> 01:00:03,145
We're... we're... What?

958
01:00:03,270 --> 01:00:05,981
But don't worry, a new love|drives out the old love

959
01:00:06,106 --> 01:00:07,649
and as good a love comes|as goes,,

960
01:00:07,816 --> 01:00:10,486
and I know you're going to be|very happy with Gema.

961
01:00:10,819 --> 01:00:11,820
Say something.

962
01:00:12,029 --> 01:00:13,655
- And Rafa?|- What about Rafa?

963
01:00:14,031 --> 01:00:16,283
- Where does Rafa come from?|- From Rafael.

964
01:00:16,450 --> 01:00:18,994
Like Paco from Francisco,|Pepe from Jose, Pitu from Anibal.

965
01:00:19,203 --> 01:00:21,747
No, listen, I think|you're getting confused.

966
01:00:21,830 --> 01:00:23,707
I'm the one leaving you

967
01:00:23,957 --> 01:00:26,376
I want nothing to do with you|or your cousin.

968
01:00:26,543 --> 01:00:29,087
- Why not?|- Because he's hurt, but just wait.

969
01:00:29,296 --> 01:00:31,507
There are lots of vibrations|between you.

970
01:00:31,840 --> 01:00:34,927
You don't get it, Pilar.|I'm leaving you.

971
01:00:35,052 --> 01:00:38,847
Who loses a wife, gains a lot.|You're on your own.

972
01:00:39,056 --> 01:00:40,516
Where does Carlos come from?

973
01:00:40,682 --> 01:00:41,892
From my father.

974
01:00:42,684 --> 01:00:43,811
Pilar, look...

975
01:00:43,936 --> 01:00:46,647
The longest day has an end,|time cures all,

976
01:00:46,814 --> 01:00:49,817
what can't be can't be|and, anyway, it's impossible.

977
01:00:50,234 --> 01:00:51,819
Leave my stuff alone!

978
01:00:59,368 --> 01:01:01,703
{Y:i}My friend,

979
01:01:01,870 --> 01:01:06,458
{Y:i}if you only knew|what love is like

980
01:01:07,042 --> 01:01:10,420
{Y:i}It goes back|to whoever takes it,

981
01:01:10,587 --> 01:01:13,382
{Y:i}hawk

982
01:01:13,924 --> 01:01:16,760
{Y:i}or dove.

983
01:01:17,135 --> 01:01:19,304
{Y:i}Poor fool,

984
01:01:19,972 --> 01:01:24,935
{Y:i}naive charlatan.

985
01:01:25,435 --> 01:01:28,272
{Y:i}I was a dove

986
01:01:28,480 --> 01:01:34,278
{Y:i}because I wanted to be a hawk.

987
01:01:38,115 --> 01:01:39,032
What's up?

988
01:01:40,242 --> 01:01:42,828
I've left Pilar, so...

989
01:01:44,204 --> 01:01:45,080
Why?

990
01:01:45,205 --> 01:01:46,832
Because... because...

991
01:01:49,042 --> 01:01:52,296
At times it isn't a question|of why, Javier.

992
01:01:52,421 --> 01:01:54,298
I've left her. Understand?

993
01:01:56,508 --> 01:01:57,426
Sure.

994
01:01:58,594 --> 01:01:59,303
Sure.

995
01:02:01,763 --> 01:02:02,848
Sure.

996
01:02:03,891 --> 01:02:06,685
What I'd like right now|is to have a drink..

997
01:02:06,852 --> 01:02:09,980
I always like to have a drink|before I go to bed,

998
01:02:10,189 --> 01:02:12,608
but if you can't|or don't feel like it,

999
01:02:12,774 --> 01:02:13,984
it's not...

1000
01:02:14,109 --> 01:02:16,945
- Shall we have one in my place?|- Is this your place?

1001
01:02:20,324 --> 01:02:23,118
- Come off it.|- No, I didn't know...

1002
01:02:23,494 --> 01:02:26,788
I don't want to go to bed late|but if you want we'll have one.

1003
01:02:26,955 --> 01:02:28,415
One, or all we want.

1004
01:02:28,499 --> 01:02:31,043
I like a drink too|before I go to bed.

1005
01:02:41,970 --> 01:02:43,847
Wait, wait, wait.

1006
01:02:44,014 --> 01:02:46,016
Not like that.

1007
01:02:54,858 --> 01:02:55,984
What's wrong?

1008
01:02:56,860 --> 01:02:57,945
I'm fed up.

1009
01:02:58,070 --> 01:03:00,572
You could show more interest.

1010
01:03:02,157 --> 01:03:03,700
What's wrong?

1011
01:03:04,243 --> 01:03:07,996
- Don't you like me anymore?|- Don't start that, I'm not a guy.

1012
01:03:12,000 --> 01:03:13,043
All right.

1013
01:03:15,379 --> 01:03:16,964
You know that I'm more...

1014
01:03:17,548 --> 01:03:19,800
more into cuddles, Marta,

1015
01:03:19,967 --> 01:03:21,760
and when I was with Pedro...

1016
01:03:21,885 --> 01:03:24,930
Pedro again!|What's up with Pedro now?

1017
01:03:25,013 --> 01:03:26,890
It was different.

1018
01:03:27,057 --> 01:03:28,142
He was more

1019
01:03:28,308 --> 01:03:31,812
loving, more considerate,|and now it's...

1020
01:03:31,979 --> 01:03:32,980
Hang on a minute.

1021
01:03:33,188 --> 01:03:36,024
Are you saying|I'm not considerate?

1022
01:03:36,191 --> 01:03:38,652
No, Marta, you're a bit rough.

1023
01:03:39,236 --> 01:03:42,072
Now it tums out that|Pedro has got a velvet touch..

1024
01:03:42,239 --> 01:03:43,699
It's not that.

1025
01:03:43,866 --> 01:03:46,493
Don't get annoyed,|it's just that you're

1026
01:03:46,702 --> 01:03:48,662
more boom-boom bang-bang...

1027
01:03:48,745 --> 01:03:50,831
Boom-boom bang-bang?

1028
01:03:50,998 --> 01:03:53,500
Yes, and it's always the same

1029
01:03:53,584 --> 01:03:55,544
and I'm tired of it.

1030
01:03:55,711 --> 01:03:58,463
Obviously, if you prefer Pedro!

1031
01:03:59,173 --> 01:04:01,175
I didn't say that!

1032
01:04:01,717 --> 01:04:04,344
It's just that Pedro|is a genius at preliminaries.

1033
01:04:04,553 --> 01:04:08,265
No, it's that I'm very passionate|and Pedro is a wimp!

1034
01:04:08,432 --> 01:04:09,391
Good night.

1035
01:04:12,936 --> 01:04:15,397
- Don't be so silly!|- Stop it!

1036
01:04:15,522 --> 01:04:17,232
- Marta, please,|- Leave me alone!

1037
01:04:17,441 --> 01:04:20,068
I'm just saying|it's better like this.

1038
01:04:21,153 --> 01:04:22,196
Stop that.

1039
01:04:22,571 --> 01:04:24,198
Stop!

1040
01:04:28,744 --> 01:04:31,079
All right, it is nice like that.

1041
01:04:31,997 --> 01:04:35,125
But put a bit of life|into it, please!

1042
01:04:39,505 --> 01:04:41,089
Well, another drink?

1043
01:04:41,256 --> 01:04:43,926
All right, one, or all we want.

1044
01:04:53,435 --> 01:04:54,895
Why the hell are you here?

1045
01:04:55,187 --> 01:04:58,232
- Why the hell are you here?|- I'd a date with Carlota too.

1046
01:04:58,398 --> 01:05:01,360
- Forget it, we're very busy.|- Hello, Javier!

1047
01:05:01,527 --> 01:05:02,528
Come in!

1048
01:05:03,403 --> 01:05:04,488
Thank you.

1049
01:05:05,405 --> 01:05:06,782
- Pedro!|- Really!

1050
01:05:07,032 --> 01:05:08,408
Come in, really!

1051
01:05:08,575 --> 01:05:09,535
How are you?

1052
01:05:09,868 --> 01:05:11,036
- Fine, and you?|- Fine.

1053
01:05:11,203 --> 01:05:12,412
- You look lovely.|- Yes?

1054
01:05:12,496 --> 01:05:13,664
Want a drink?

1055
01:05:13,831 --> 01:05:15,040
No, you don't.

1056
01:05:15,207 --> 01:05:16,416
Thank you.

1057
01:05:20,963 --> 01:05:22,464
I was first.

1058
01:05:22,714 --> 01:05:25,133
What are you, 10 years old?|Grow up a bit.

1059
01:05:25,467 --> 01:05:26,593
You grow up, Pedro.

1060
01:05:26,802 --> 01:05:28,637
- Me?|- You've been here three hours

1061
01:05:28,804 --> 01:05:31,181
and you're still like this.|- Because we want to be.

1062
01:05:31,348 --> 01:05:34,810
- These are just preliminaries.|- At this stage?

1063
01:05:34,977 --> 01:05:37,896
Yes, the second preliminaries.|Everything has happened.

1064
01:05:38,480 --> 01:05:39,606
What's happened?

1065
01:05:40,649 --> 01:05:42,234
Everything. Even...

1066
01:05:42,609 --> 01:05:43,569
Even what?

1067
01:05:44,611 --> 01:05:45,737
Even that.

1068
01:05:46,780 --> 01:05:48,949
I doubt that you've done it.

1069
01:05:49,116 --> 01:05:51,743
Well, stop doubting,|we've done it twice!

1070
01:05:51,910 --> 01:05:54,913
I don't care, because|you can't do it well and I can.

1071
01:05:55,164 --> 01:05:57,875
I don't know if you do it well|but you certainly do it fast.

1072
01:05:58,041 --> 01:06:00,836
We have problems hanging on.

1073
01:06:01,044 --> 01:06:03,547
I haven't got any problem.

1074
01:06:03,714 --> 01:06:06,800
You must have, if your girl|is doing it with another girl.

1075
01:06:13,432 --> 01:06:15,017
Who happens to be your girl.

1076
01:06:15,184 --> 01:06:16,560
Exactly.

1077
01:06:18,562 --> 01:06:21,607
I work like a Swiss watch.

1078
01:06:36,246 --> 01:06:37,206
Javier...

1079
01:06:41,168 --> 01:06:44,671
But the thing is|Marta is more boom-boom

1080
01:06:44,838 --> 01:06:46,173
bang-bang all the time.

1081
01:06:46,924 --> 01:06:48,425
Right.

1082
01:06:48,592 --> 01:06:50,511
And I prefer other things.

1083
01:06:52,387 --> 01:06:53,680
That's normal.

1084
01:06:55,599 --> 01:06:56,558
Poor thing.

1085
01:06:57,351 --> 01:06:58,977
Calm down, calm down.

1086
01:07:18,247 --> 01:07:19,581
Got a cough?

1087
01:07:21,708 --> 01:07:22,793
What's wrong?

1088
01:07:25,254 --> 01:07:26,255
My earring!

1089
01:07:26,380 --> 01:07:28,173
He swallowed my earring!

1090
01:07:37,641 --> 01:07:38,559
Better?

1091
01:07:40,060 --> 01:07:41,937
You nearly broke my plexus.

1092
01:07:42,062 --> 01:07:44,273
You've done irreversible damage.

1093
01:07:53,407 --> 01:07:54,533
- You first.|- No, you.

1094
01:07:54,700 --> 01:07:55,659
You first.

1095
01:08:01,331 --> 01:08:02,583
- Ready?|- Yes.

1096
01:08:02,708 --> 01:08:04,209
- Ready?|- Yes?

1097
01:08:12,050 --> 01:08:13,927
We're practicing the shot put.

1098
01:08:18,849 --> 01:08:20,350
How about dinner tonight?

1099
01:08:20,517 --> 01:08:21,602
What?

1100
01:08:22,936 --> 01:08:24,563
What did that idiot say?

1101
01:08:45,125 --> 01:08:46,919
Tell me, what's up?

1102
01:08:47,878 --> 01:08:49,505
You have to choose now.

1103
01:08:51,340 --> 01:08:53,550
- What do I have to choose?|- Which one you prefer.

1104
01:08:53,717 --> 01:08:57,513
- We'll end up killing each other.|- You're the one threatening me.

1105
01:08:57,679 --> 01:08:58,972
All right.

1106
01:08:59,139 --> 01:09:01,517
I hadn't thought about it,|but if you want, I'll choose.

1107
01:09:01,725 --> 01:09:03,769
Will you stand up for a minute?

1108
01:09:12,319 --> 01:09:14,446
Pedro,|can you throw your hair back?

1109
01:09:25,916 --> 01:09:27,084
That's fine.

1110
01:09:27,543 --> 01:09:28,502
You can sit down.

1111
01:09:37,302 --> 01:09:38,470
Both of you.

1112
01:09:41,932 --> 01:09:43,308
Both of us for what?

1113
01:09:43,475 --> 01:09:44,601
Both of us for...

1114
01:09:45,686 --> 01:09:47,229
Shit! A trio?

1115
01:09:47,563 --> 01:09:48,856
No fucking way.

1116
01:09:51,358 --> 01:09:52,568
{Y:i}A trio.

1117
01:09:53,068 --> 01:09:55,070
{Y:i}A triumvirate.

1118
01:09:55,237 --> 01:09:57,156
{Y:i}She wants us to do a trio.

1119
01:09:57,447 --> 01:10:00,909
{Y:i}Shit, maybe with another girl,|but with Javier!

1120
01:10:01,118 --> 01:10:02,911
{Y:i}What's wrong with women?

1121
01:10:04,079 --> 01:10:05,914
{Y:i}Have they all gone mad?

1122
01:10:06,665 --> 01:10:08,208
{Y:i}How do you do a trio?

1123
01:10:09,209 --> 01:10:12,588
{Y:i}I'll have to watch a porn movie|to get some ideas.

1124
01:10:12,754 --> 01:10:14,882
{Y:i}They're unbalanced,

1125
01:10:15,048 --> 01:10:17,926
{Y:i}they become lesbians,|they want to do trios.

1126
01:10:19,970 --> 01:10:21,263
{Y:i}What's going on here?

1127
01:10:21,513 --> 01:10:24,600
{Y:i}If it's an hour earlier|in the Canaries,

1128
01:10:24,892 --> 01:10:26,435
{Y:i}when the clocks go back

1129
01:10:27,186 --> 01:10:29,021
{Y:i}for an hour it's the same time

1130
01:10:29,146 --> 01:10:31,440
{Y:i}in the Canaries as in Spain.

1131
01:10:31,607 --> 01:10:34,193
{Y:i}Javier and I|mustn't touch each other

1132
01:10:34,485 --> 01:10:36,570
{Y:i}Shit,|or even look at each other.

1133
01:10:36,778 --> 01:10:38,614
{Y:i}We'll have to get drunk first

1134
01:10:38,780 --> 01:10:40,949
{Y:i}or do something to break the ice.

1135
01:10:41,116 --> 01:10:43,744
{Y:i}Wait till I tell them|in the museum!

1136
01:10:43,952 --> 01:10:45,913
{Y:i}And when the clocks go forward

1137
01:10:46,121 --> 01:10:50,209
{Y:i}for a while there are two hours more|in Spain than in the Canaries.

1138
01:10:50,375 --> 01:10:54,755
{Y:i}How is it that I'm the only one|to have realized that?

1139
01:10:55,048 --> 01:10:56,132
It's here.

1140
01:11:09,478 --> 01:11:10,979
Shit, you're lovely!

1141
01:11:11,230 --> 01:11:13,273
- What the fuck is that?|- Isn't it beautiful?

1142
01:11:13,482 --> 01:11:16,318
I saw it in the store window|and said, "Mine".

1143
01:11:16,401 --> 01:11:18,028
It was like an encounter.

1144
01:11:18,320 --> 01:11:21,448
I thought of finding|a place for it in the house.

1145
01:11:21,657 --> 01:11:22,991
Maybe beside the TV?

1146
01:11:23,158 --> 01:11:25,369
Rafa, it's disgusting.

1147
01:11:26,995 --> 01:11:27,996
Why?

1148
01:11:28,163 --> 01:11:30,123
Because it's fucking dead.

1149
01:11:30,374 --> 01:11:32,835
Yes,|but it looks like it's alive.

1150
01:11:33,001 --> 01:11:34,211
Just look at it!

1151
01:11:34,378 --> 01:11:37,097
Its eyes are alive!|It's in attack position...

1152
01:11:37,139 --> 01:11:41,218
No! Put it out on the street|I don't want dead animals in the house.

1153
01:11:50,352 --> 01:11:52,312
We'll go to my room.

1154
01:11:52,855 --> 01:11:54,857
It can go on my bedside table.

1155
01:11:55,274 --> 01:11:58,026
But I don't say anything|about the furniture here.

1156
01:11:58,193 --> 01:12:00,320
There isn't one fucking drawer.

1157
01:12:00,529 --> 01:12:03,574
Don't you worry,|we'll be fine in my room.

1158
01:12:03,699 --> 01:12:05,367
I've got a portable TV

1159
01:12:05,617 --> 01:12:06,910
and more things.

1160
01:12:07,077 --> 01:12:09,538
How long have we been|friends with Rafa?

1161
01:12:10,038 --> 01:12:11,373
All our lives

1162
01:12:12,124 --> 01:12:13,959
Why is he our friend?

1163
01:12:16,378 --> 01:12:17,629
I don't know.

1164
01:12:17,880 --> 01:12:19,339
I really don't know.

1165
01:12:23,385 --> 01:12:24,511
Am I...

1166
01:12:24,678 --> 01:12:26,096
Am I your best friend?

1167
01:12:26,221 --> 01:12:27,181
Yes.

1168
01:12:27,347 --> 01:12:29,308
You're my best friend.

1169
01:12:30,225 --> 01:12:31,560
You're like...

1170
01:12:31,727 --> 01:12:33,353
You're like a brother.

1171
01:12:33,520 --> 01:12:35,272
Same here.

1172
01:12:35,647 --> 01:12:39,568
You know that brothers|sometimes do things

1173
01:12:40,360 --> 01:12:42,070
that aren't very normal.

1174
01:12:43,155 --> 01:12:44,656
They may not be normal

1175
01:12:44,781 --> 01:12:48,243
but that doesn't mean|that those things are bad.

1176
01:12:49,578 --> 01:12:52,289
Society changes and evolves.

1177
01:12:52,456 --> 01:12:55,959
Evolves?|It evolves at the speed of light.

1178
01:12:59,588 --> 01:13:00,422
Tomorrow.

1179
01:13:00,714 --> 01:13:01,590
Tomorrow.

1180
01:13:02,090 --> 01:13:03,550
Rafa's working.

1181
01:13:04,343 --> 01:13:07,137
- But we don't look at each other.|- For God's sake.

1182
01:13:08,013 --> 01:13:09,264
For God's sake.

1183
01:13:15,312 --> 01:13:16,563
Wait!

1184
01:13:16,730 --> 01:13:19,983
Look at that offer.|Paris, 4 days, 300 euros.

1185
01:13:21,485 --> 01:13:22,694
Let's go.

1186
01:13:23,529 --> 01:13:25,280
- Shall we?|- But...

1187
01:13:25,447 --> 01:13:26,782
Paris?

1188
01:13:27,115 --> 01:13:28,450
No, not Paris

1189
01:13:28,659 --> 01:13:30,410
Paris? Why not?

1190
01:13:31,745 --> 01:13:33,497
Because

1191
01:13:34,122 --> 01:13:37,459
the first trip I made with Pedro

1192
01:13:37,626 --> 01:13:39,294
was to Paris, and...

1193
01:13:39,795 --> 01:13:42,798
And what?|I don't see why we can't go now.

1194
01:13:42,965 --> 01:13:46,677
Marta, everything is going|to remind me of Pedro,

1195
01:13:46,844 --> 01:13:49,138
I'll be thinking about him.

1196
01:13:49,304 --> 01:13:51,306
I mean... I think so.

1197
01:14:00,941 --> 01:14:02,901
Why don't you go back to Pedro?

1198
01:14:05,195 --> 01:14:08,073
Don't be silly. I love you.

1199
01:14:08,615 --> 01:14:11,118
Yeah, but you love Pedro more.

1200
01:14:12,578 --> 01:14:15,038
You talk about him all day

1201
01:14:15,205 --> 01:14:17,791
{Y:i}and everything we do reminds you|of when you were together...

1202
01:14:18,000 --> 01:14:19,960
Yes, I miss him

1203
01:14:21,003 --> 01:14:23,505
but I want to be with you too.

1204
01:14:24,173 --> 01:14:27,176
I'd rather you were with him|and missing me.

1205
01:14:29,344 --> 01:14:32,681
I need to be with someone|who's in love with me.

1206
01:14:34,308 --> 01:14:37,352
I want someone|who's dying about me,

1207
01:14:39,021 --> 01:14:40,856
and you're an angel

1208
01:14:41,982 --> 01:14:43,942
but you're not in love with me.

1209
01:14:45,194 --> 01:14:48,363
You know, the nicest thing|that's ever happened to me

1210
01:14:48,530 --> 01:14:50,157
was being with you,

1211
01:14:51,366 --> 01:14:54,870
but it's best if we finish it|before everything is ruined.

1212
01:14:59,041 --> 01:15:00,167
But...

1213
01:15:07,216 --> 01:15:08,175
Marta!

1214
01:15:24,399 --> 01:15:25,400
Look! Look!

1215
01:15:27,528 --> 01:15:28,862
Two lesbians.

1216
01:15:29,029 --> 01:15:30,280
What was I saying?

1217
01:15:30,948 --> 01:15:34,284
Spanish reasoning is internal,|I never tire of saying that,

1218
01:15:34,493 --> 01:15:37,538
and nothing is...|You know? Obviously.

1219
01:15:37,704 --> 01:15:38,622
Understand?

1220
01:15:38,747 --> 01:15:41,792
I listen to the radio,|know what I mean?

1221
01:15:41,959 --> 01:15:45,629
I know at what level|things are moving, you know,

1222
01:15:46,171 --> 01:15:48,757
and it's all going to hell.

1223
01:15:51,385 --> 01:15:52,803
Spain is finished.

1224
01:16:07,860 --> 01:16:11,071
This isn't the way, and you're|going down a one-way street

1225
01:16:11,196 --> 01:16:12,940
Éthe wrong way.|- It's a shortcut.| Don't tell me how to do my job.


1226
01:16:13,024 --> 01:16:17,452
I'm killing myself|twelve hours a day.

1227
01:16:18,036 --> 01:16:19,955
Why are we going so slowly?

1228
01:16:20,080 --> 01:16:21,456
ÉIt's better.

1229
01:16:36,180 --> 01:16:37,473
Why are we stopping?

1230
01:16:45,647 --> 01:16:46,857
Charlie...

1231
01:16:47,441 --> 01:16:48,817
Charlie...

1232
01:16:50,527 --> 01:16:52,112
Jose Carlos!

1233
01:16:52,321 --> 01:16:53,655
I need help.

1234
01:16:54,823 --> 01:16:56,325
She won't come.

1235
01:16:56,492 --> 01:16:57,951
She won't, 

1236
01:16:58,994 --> 01:17:00,078
will she?

1237
01:17:00,996 --> 01:17:02,039
I mean,

1238
01:17:02,247 --> 01:17:03,415
an hour and a half.

1239
01:17:03,582 --> 01:17:05,334
an hour and a half.

1240
01:17:07,920 --> 01:17:09,463
Just as well.

1241
01:17:09,546 --> 01:17:10,797
Why?

1242
01:17:11,632 --> 01:17:14,009
Because it's just as well.

1243
01:17:14,676 --> 01:17:16,970
- These things never work out.|- No, they don't.

1244
01:17:17,095 --> 01:17:19,264
I withdraw.

1245
01:17:20,015 --> 01:17:22,059
I've got better things to do.

1246
01:17:22,226 --> 01:17:23,769
I withdraw.

1247
01:17:23,936 --> 01:17:25,979
You withdraw unilaterally,|without...

1248
01:17:26,188 --> 01:17:27,022
"I withdraw. "

1249
01:17:28,023 --> 01:17:29,525
Well, now I withdraw.

1250
01:17:29,691 --> 01:17:31,193
No, because...

1251
01:17:31,360 --> 01:17:33,904
Because I said...|I said "I withdraw"

1252
01:17:34,071 --> 01:17:36,323
and I said it first.|- All right, you withdraw.

1253
01:17:38,826 --> 01:17:40,118
She came.

1254
01:17:40,244 --> 01:17:41,537
She came.

1255
01:17:43,705 --> 01:17:45,624
- Who'll open the door?|- I'll do it.

1256
01:17:45,791 --> 01:17:47,668
- No, I'll do it.|- We'll both do it.

1257
01:17:47,876 --> 01:17:49,503
}No, it's stupid if we both do it.

1258
01:17:49,711 --> 01:17:52,047
- Then you do it.|- No, you do it, you do it.

1259
01:17:52,214 --> 01:17:53,298
What's it to be?

1260
01:17:54,716 --> 01:17:56,051
You. Go on.

1261
01:17:58,804 --> 01:18:00,722
What I said before doesn't count.

1262
01:18:03,392 --> 01:18:04,977
You can't do that!

1263
01:18:10,691 --> 01:18:13,152
- Hello.|- Hello, come in.

1264
01:18:15,988 --> 01:18:17,322
- How are you?|- Fine, and you?

1265
01:18:17,656 --> 01:18:18,782
Fine.

1266
01:18:20,450 --> 01:18:23,495
- I'm sorry I'm late, I didn't...|- Don't worry.

1267
01:18:23,662 --> 01:18:25,831
You're not that late.

1268
01:18:26,498 --> 01:18:27,416
Where's Pedro?

1269
01:18:28,000 --> 01:18:29,168
- Hello.|- Hello, Pedro.

1270
01:18:29,334 --> 01:18:30,335
So you're here.

1271
01:18:30,502 --> 01:18:31,461
- Yes.|- Great.

1272
01:18:31,628 --> 01:18:34,882
- Sorry I'm late.|- Don't worry, we didn't even notice.

1273
01:18:39,428 --> 01:18:40,679
It's hot, isn't it?

1274
01:18:43,390 --> 01:18:46,226
- You look lovely.|- Yes, you look lovely.

1275
01:18:46,393 --> 01:18:47,352
Thank you.

1276
01:18:47,478 --> 01:18:49,062
You two look very handsome.

1277
01:18:49,313 --> 01:18:50,522
Shall I take your coat?

1278
01:18:59,573 --> 01:19:00,782
A glass of wine or...

1279
01:19:01,325 --> 01:19:03,118
- Or two?|- The bottle!

1280
01:19:05,329 --> 01:19:07,789
One question,|dinner before or after?

1281
01:19:07,956 --> 01:19:08,790
- Before.|- After.

1282
01:19:08,957 --> 01:19:10,000
- After.|- Before.

1283
01:19:10,167 --> 01:19:11,460
- Whatever.|- It doesn't matter.

1284
01:19:11,835 --> 01:19:14,171
If we're this well coordinated...

1285
01:19:59,299 --> 01:20:00,300
Three.

1286
01:20:00,634 --> 01:20:01,593
Like us.

1287
01:20:01,677 --> 01:20:03,011
Sit down.

1288
01:20:05,013 --> 01:20:07,099
Be generous, Javier.

1289
01:20:09,184 --> 01:20:10,310
Shall we begin?

1290
01:20:11,145 --> 01:20:13,147
- What, here?|- The meal.

1291
01:20:13,272 --> 01:20:15,065
Yes, yes!

1292
01:20:15,357 --> 01:20:16,441
Let's start.

1293
01:20:16,608 --> 01:20:18,152
These crabs...

1294
01:20:20,571 --> 01:20:22,156
Give me the plate.

1295
01:20:25,993 --> 01:20:28,370
I don't think|I can swallow anything.

1296
01:20:28,796 --> 01:20:30,205
Any food?

1297
01:20:33,584 --> 01:20:35,878
Why don't we stop messing around?

1298
01:20:36,253 --> 01:20:38,672
- Let's relax a bit.|- Yes! Yes!

1299
01:20:38,839 --> 01:20:40,674
We're kind of...

1300
01:20:40,841 --> 01:20:43,469
- How about a toast?|- We're going to loosen up.

1301
01:20:43,719 --> 01:20:45,345
This is more relaxed.

1302
01:20:46,388 --> 01:20:48,724
Well, here's to seduction.

1303
01:20:48,849 --> 01:20:51,351
- And to all our exes.|- To us.

1304
01:20:51,477 --> 01:20:54,104
- To us, much better.|- No, to the three of us.

1305
01:20:54,271 --> 01:20:55,189
Right.

1306
01:21:10,787 --> 01:21:13,081
{Y:i}Don't say a word.

1307
01:21:15,959 --> 01:21:17,544
{Y:i}I see it all

1308
01:21:19,087 --> 01:21:21,548
{Y:i}in your eyes.

1309
01:21:24,259 --> 01:21:26,261
{Y:i}You are

1310
01:21:27,596 --> 01:21:30,599
{Y:i}trying to leave.

1311
01:21:32,684 --> 01:21:34,144
{Y:i}And I

1312
01:21:35,729 --> 01:21:38,816
{Y:i}want to get you.

1313
01:21:41,276 --> 01:21:44,488
{Y:i}I want, I want,|I want to kiss you.

1314
01:21:45,614 --> 01:21:48,826
{Y:i}I want, I want,|I want to kiss you.

1315
01:21:49,618 --> 01:21:53,163
{Y:i}I want, I want,|I want to kiss you.

1316
01:21:57,960 --> 01:21:59,837
{Y:i}Hey,

1317
01:22:00,963 --> 01:22:03,924
{Y:i}sit down by my side.

1318
01:22:06,301 --> 01:22:08,345
{Y:i}Hey,

1319
01:22:09,471 --> 01:22:11,932
{Y:i}I like you too much.

1320
01:22:14,476 --> 01:22:16,311
{Y:i}I am

1321
01:22:17,604 --> 01:22:20,399
Y:i}nervous and excited.

1322
01:22:23,068 --> 01:22:24,778
{Y:i}Baby,

1323
01:22:25,946 --> 01:22:28,490
{Y:i}don't leave me in the lurch.

1324
01:22:31,660 --> 01:22:35,706
{Y:i}Wait, don't go,|hang on for a minute.

1325
01:22:35,914 --> 01:22:39,668
{Y:i}Let me explain|why you're confused.

1326
01:22:39,835 --> 01:22:44,631
{Y:i}I just want to get to know you|and have a good time.

1327
01:22:48,594 --> 01:22:52,556
{Y:i}Give me your hand,|no one will disturb us.

1328
01:22:52,931 --> 01:22:56,894
{Y:i}There's no one home today|and I'm feeling in great form.

1329
01:22:57,102 --> 01:23:00,147
{Y:i}Let me take your clothes off

1330
01:23:01,523 --> 01:23:04,401
{Y:i}and don't switch off the light.

1331
01:23:05,194 --> 01:23:08,322
{Y:i}I want, I want,|I want to kiss you.

1332
01:23:08,906 --> 01:23:12,242
{Y:i}I want, I want,|I want to kiss you.

1333
01:23:13,535 --> 01:23:16,288
{Y:i}I want, I want,|I want to kiss you.

1334
01:23:21,543 --> 01:23:24,671
{Y:i}I want, I want,|I want to kiss you.

1335
01:23:26,048 --> 01:23:28,884
{Y:i}I want, I want,|I want to kiss you.

1336
01:23:29,802 --> 01:23:33,972
{Y:i}I want,|I want to kiss you, baby.

1337
01:23:34,139 --> 01:23:35,766
{Y:i}I want

1338
01:23:37,059 --> 01:23:38,811
{Y:i}to kiss you.

1339
01:23:47,861 --> 01:23:49,112
Shut up, bastard!

1340
01:23:49,571 --> 01:23:51,281
He's really kicking up.

1341
01:23:54,368 --> 01:23:56,745
If you need anything else, Rafa...

1342
01:24:10,134 --> 01:24:11,593
What do I do with you?

1343
01:24:14,138 --> 01:24:14,972
Kill you?

1344
01:24:17,057 --> 01:24:19,768
I'm going to tell you|a story, Carlos.

1345
01:24:20,644 --> 01:24:21,645
Look at him.

1346
01:24:23,021 --> 01:24:24,565
Look at the fox.

1347
01:24:34,199 --> 01:24:36,618
A wolf and a fox are different.

1348
01:24:37,286 --> 01:24:39,121
A wolf attacks sheep

1349
01:24:39,288 --> 01:24:41,039
and howls at the moon. Why?

1350
01:24:41,707 --> 01:24:43,959
No one knows, but it does it.

1351
01:24:49,631 --> 01:24:52,301
You're a wolf in sheep's clothing,

1352
01:24:53,635 --> 01:24:56,013
but a fox is much smarter.

1353
01:24:59,308 --> 01:25:01,393
I want an explanation.

1354
01:25:02,728 --> 01:25:04,855
He and I want an explanation.

1355
01:25:06,064 --> 01:25:06,815
Women...

1356
01:25:09,526 --> 01:25:11,320
That hurt, Carlos,

1357
01:25:13,363 --> 01:25:14,656
but you're right.

1358
01:25:14,823 --> 01:25:16,658
- Well...|- You see?

1359
01:25:17,201 --> 01:25:19,328
You understand me.

1360
01:25:19,703 --> 01:25:21,747
I've got lots of feelings,

1361
01:25:21,830 --> 01:25:24,333
lots of feelings,|but I do this

1362
01:25:25,375 --> 01:25:27,085
and I swallow them.

1363
01:25:28,629 --> 01:25:30,130
Do you love her?

1364
01:25:34,218 --> 01:25:37,179
If that's really true,|I can't stand in the way of love.

1365
01:25:39,056 --> 01:25:40,516
I just wanted you to say,

1366
01:25:40,682 --> 01:25:43,519
"Shit, Rafa, I've fallen in love|with your girl,""

1367
01:25:43,727 --> 01:25:46,355
and like a good feline|I'd have stood aside.

1368
01:25:47,648 --> 01:25:49,274
Run after her, Carlos.

1369
01:25:49,942 --> 01:25:52,069
- Well...|- Don't say anything.

1370
01:25:53,111 --> 01:25:56,031
If you don't go with her,|you'll regret it, maybe not today,

1371
01:25:56,198 --> 01:25:59,159
maybe not tomorrow, but soon,|and for the rest of your life.

1372
01:25:59,701 --> 01:26:01,203
Go with Pilar

1373
01:26:01,370 --> 01:26:03,705
and give her|what I couldn't give her.

1374
01:26:04,414 --> 01:26:05,707
So long.

1375
01:26:08,085 --> 01:26:09,837
Goodbye, my friend.

1376
01:26:12,381 --> 01:26:14,007
I did what I had to do.

1377
01:26:15,551 --> 01:26:17,845
I did what my heart told me.

1378
01:26:18,720 --> 01:26:20,347
Rafa,

1379
01:26:20,430 --> 01:26:24,768
this country would be beautiful|with more people like you and me.

1380
01:26:24,935 --> 01:26:26,520
I know, Tomas.

1381
01:26:26,895 --> 01:26:28,021
I know.

1382
01:27:15,694 --> 01:27:18,489
Shall we go up?| Got a key?

1383
01:27:18,614 --> 01:27:20,657
Yes, but I'm sure|they won't be in.

1384
01:27:20,866 --> 01:27:22,826
I'm sure they're asleep.

1385
01:27:23,202 --> 01:27:24,286
Come on.

1386
01:28:16,213 --> 01:28:18,006
He's got up. Come on.

1387
01:28:27,182 --> 01:28:28,517
Good morning.

1388
01:28:30,853 --> 01:28:32,479
- Has she gone?|- Yes.

1389
01:28:34,356 --> 01:28:35,607
How did you sleep?

1390
01:28:37,609 --> 01:28:38,527
Great.

1391
01:28:38,694 --> 01:28:39,486
And you?

1392
01:28:39,570 --> 01:28:41,113
Great.

1393
01:28:43,532 --> 01:28:45,701
- Want some juice?|- Sure.

1394
01:28:45,868 --> 01:28:47,953
- Shall I cook some eggs?|- Sure.

1395
01:29:00,799 --> 01:29:02,468
- What's up?|- You're an idiot.

1396
01:29:02,634 --> 01:29:05,053
- Why?|- Why are you copying me?

1397
01:29:05,220 --> 01:29:07,139
No, you're copying me.

1398
01:29:07,306 --> 01:29:09,209
You're an idiot.| You're a dickhead.

1399
01:29:10,476 --> 01:29:12,670
Hey,fried or scrambled?

1400
01:29:13,020 --> 01:29:14,021
Scrambled.

1401
01:29:15,356 --> 01:29:16,857
Please!

1402
01:29:18,192 --> 01:29:19,986
- Leave it, I'll do it.|- Get off.

1403
01:29:20,069 --> 01:29:21,320
- Let me do it.|- Get off!

1404
01:29:21,445 --> 01:29:23,990
- Give it to me!|- Let go. You're so silly.

1405
01:29:27,868 --> 01:29:29,829
So who's the queen|of the kitchen?

1406
01:29:30,871 --> 01:29:31,747
What's up?

1407
01:29:32,373 --> 01:29:34,000
Hello, Pedro.

1408
01:29:35,209 --> 01:29:36,085
I was...

1409
01:29:36,419 --> 01:29:37,753
I was thinking...

1410
01:29:39,922 --> 01:29:40,881
The thing is...

1411
01:29:43,968 --> 01:29:45,761
The thing is...

1412
01:29:47,763 --> 01:29:49,098
I'm sorry.

1413
01:29:51,183 --> 01:29:53,811
I've missed you so much,|because...

1414
01:30:09,618 --> 01:30:10,703
Javier,

1415
01:30:12,788 --> 01:30:14,498
Raquel is

1416
01:30:15,374 --> 01:30:16,751
moving in again

1417
01:30:18,461 --> 01:30:19,879
That's great.

1418
01:30:21,756 --> 01:30:23,549
But not completely,

1419
01:30:23,758 --> 01:30:26,135
maybe every other day

1420
01:30:26,260 --> 01:30:27,762
We'll see how it goes, right?

1421
01:30:27,970 --> 01:30:29,388
Every other day.

1422
01:30:29,555 --> 01:30:30,806
Great.

1423
01:30:30,890 --> 01:30:32,058
I'll get it.

1424
01:30:35,811 --> 01:30:37,438
Hello. Is Rafa here?

1425
01:30:37,605 --> 01:30:39,190
I don't think so.

1426
01:30:39,774 --> 01:30:41,317
My cousin Gema, Marta.

1427
01:30:41,442 --> 01:30:44,111
- Hello.|- Raquel, Pedro, my cousin Gema.

1428
01:30:44,278 --> 01:30:45,446
- Hello.|- How are you?

1429
01:30:45,696 --> 01:30:47,323
Are you five all friends?

1430
01:30:47,531 --> 01:30:49,784
Pedro, where's Rafa?

1431
01:30:49,950 --> 01:30:52,662
- He's working. Why?|- Love and hate are blood relations.

1432
01:30:52,870 --> 01:30:55,831
He may have done something crazy,|an atrocity, an aberration.

1433
01:30:55,873 --> 01:30:58,167
- Let's go.|- Well, goodbye.

1434
01:30:58,793 --> 01:31:00,503
See you tomorrow.

1435
01:31:00,670 --> 01:31:03,506
Every other day, right?

1436
01:31:06,050 --> 01:31:07,885
Shall we go?|Come on. So long.

1437
01:31:09,428 --> 01:31:10,680
- So long.|- So long.

1438
01:31:11,722 --> 01:31:12,682
Well, I think

1439
01:31:12,974 --> 01:31:16,185
we should go in, we might find|a clue, a note, because the fact is

1440
01:31:16,519 --> 01:31:19,605
we're worried, uncertain,

1441
01:31:19,730 --> 01:31:23,025
Will you just shut up?
I'm tired.

1442
01:31:24,193 --> 01:31:26,028
We're leaving.|Come on.

1443
01:31:26,737 --> 01:31:29,323
Yes, darling.|Gema, let's go.

1444
01:31:29,532 --> 01:31:32,201
She's old enough|to do what she wants.

1445
01:31:32,868 --> 01:31:33,869
Come on.

1446
01:31:39,709 --> 01:31:40,668
So long.

1447
01:31:45,089 --> 01:31:47,466
Marta...|Where does that come from?

1448
01:31:48,926 --> 01:31:51,679
It's a very long story.

1449
01:31:53,431 --> 01:31:58,019
Want to hear it?
sure

1450
01:32:42,438 --> 01:32:43,689
Hey!

1451
01:32:45,941 --> 01:32:46,651
What's up?

1452
01:32:47,443 --> 01:32:48,778
Nothing.

1453
01:32:49,695 --> 01:32:51,238
I'm back again.

1454
01:32:54,700 --> 01:32:58,162
I'll pack my bags now|and move out tomorrow.

1455
01:32:59,372 --> 01:33:00,748
Well...

1456
01:33:01,957 --> 01:33:04,919
I'm delighted for you|that you're back with Raquel.

1457
01:33:05,836 --> 01:33:07,296
Back with her...

1458
01:33:08,214 --> 01:33:11,467
We'll see. Right now,|it's every other day.

1459
01:33:11,634 --> 01:33:13,094
You will be.

1460
01:33:13,636 --> 01:33:16,005
She'd be crazy to let you go.

1461
01:33:22,520 --> 01:33:25,439
And you and Marta,|you're bound to...

1462
01:33:27,984 --> 01:33:30,069
With Marta or whoever.

1463
01:33:35,574 --> 01:33:36,867
You're great.

1464
01:33:37,994 --> 01:33:39,829
Yeah, I'm with someone.

1465
01:33:39,996 --> 01:33:41,205
You are?

1466
01:33:42,164 --> 01:33:43,666
Yeah, she's...

1467
01:33:45,459 --> 01:33:47,044
She's very strange.

1468
01:33:49,422 --> 01:33:52,842
- And a hot number too.|- Yes, sir.

1469
01:33:53,843 --> 01:33:54,677
Yes, sir.

1470
01:33:55,261 --> 01:33:56,387
Of course.

1471
01:33:59,265 --> 01:34:01,517
You needn't pack your bags,|you know.

1472
01:34:01,642 --> 01:34:05,021
The house is enormous.|There's room for both of us.

1473
01:34:05,187 --> 01:34:08,232
- No, I don't want to bother you.|- What do you mean, bother me?

1474
01:34:08,441 --> 01:34:10,359
That's it, it's settled.

1475
01:34:10,526 --> 01:34:13,195
No more arguing,|you're staying here.

1476
01:34:15,990 --> 01:34:16,907
All right.

1477
01:34:17,575 --> 01:34:18,659
Shit, of course.

1478
01:34:20,202 --> 01:34:21,662
Do you realize

1479
01:34:21,871 --> 01:34:24,874
the things that happen to us|and we're still together?

1480
01:34:25,041 --> 01:34:27,543
Things have happened all right.

1481
01:34:30,004 --> 01:34:31,672
Things have happened.

1482
01:34:32,381 --> 01:34:34,383
I'm sure that whatever happens,

1483
01:34:35,217 --> 01:34:37,511
you and I will carry on, so...

1484
01:34:38,095 --> 01:34:39,472
No matter what.

1485
01:34:40,765 --> 01:34:42,350
All our lives.

1486
01:34:42,975 --> 01:34:44,435
You and I.

1487
01:35:39,782 --> 01:35:41,117
What...

1488
01:35:57,008 --> 01:35:59,677
We're such good friends that...

1489
01:35:59,844 --> 01:36:01,220
Shit!

1490
01:36:03,597 --> 01:36:05,491
What are you saying?

1491
01:36:07,893 --> 01:36:09,562
I feel cheated.

1492
01:36:09,729 --> 01:36:11,063
Stop kidding yourself, Rafa

1493
01:36:11,272 --> 01:36:14,275
We're all bisexual.
So...

1494
01:36:17,945 --> 01:36:19,238
Possibly.

1495
01:36:24,035 --> 01:36:25,703
Possibly..
