2
00:01:02,800 --> 00:01:03,800
Wait.

3
00:01:04,601 --> 00:01:05,999
You needn't come up with me.

4
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:08,900
I can get into the apartment without your assistance.

5
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:13,201
Wait!

6
00:01:37,002 --> 00:01:38,202
Gerry, darling...

7
00:01:38,203 --> 00:01:41,883
Please, please forgive me for what happened tonight.

8
00:01:41,999 --> 00:01:44,184
I admit I was wrong.

9
00:01:44,185 --> 00:01:46,485
You did alright for yourself.

10
00:01:46,486 --> 00:01:50,586
Why do you insist on spoiling
a perfectly good New Year's Eve?

11
00:01:50,587 --> 00:01:52,587
I haven't. It's hardly midnight.

12
00:01:52,588 --> 00:01:56,700
You won't lack company.
You didn't earlier this evening.

13
00:01:59,501 --> 00:02:01,301
Gerry, that's not like you.

14
00:02:01,302 --> 00:02:03,302
I know. I'm a brunette.

15
00:02:10,603 --> 00:02:14,203
Besides, I didn't think you noticed it.

16
00:02:14,204 --> 00:02:17,504
I tried not to for some time.

17
00:02:18,405 --> 00:02:21,005
After all, my dear, a man must live.

18
00:02:21,006 --> 00:02:25,506
I've often wondered why it was necessary
in some cases.

19
00:02:33,907 --> 00:02:35,407
Will you please be serious.

20
00:02:35,408 --> 00:02:39,008
I am serious. The trouble has been that
you haven't been serious.

21
00:02:39,009 --> 00:02:43,109
Don't you see to a girl it means so much more
than just an adventure?

22
00:02:43,110 --> 00:02:45,110
Jim, you've been the only man in my life.

23
00:02:46,311 --> 00:02:49,611
I wish I had known it was going to end this way.

24
00:02:50,312 --> 00:02:52,402
It doesn't have to end this way.

25
00:02:53,203 --> 00:02:56,703
Oh, please, dear, let's forget it.
Let's start this New Year's right.

26
00:02:57,604 --> 00:02:59,704
I am starting it right.

27
00:02:59,705 --> 00:03:00,999
Without you.

28
00:03:01,000 --> 00:03:03,100
With whom then?

29
00:03:03,601 --> 00:03:07,101
You would ask that.
I'm starting it with myself. Me.

30
00:03:07,102 --> 00:03:10,102
Gerry, your ex um...
Gerry...

31
00:03:10,103 --> 00:03:13,003
I'm not ashamed or afraid.

32
00:03:13,004 --> 00:03:16,204
Bye, Jim. Have a good New Year.

33
00:03:16,205 --> 00:03:19,805
I'm going to have the best New Year I ever had
since I've grown up.

34
00:03:29,000 --> 00:03:32,306
Gerry, will you marry me?

35
00:03:34,207 --> 00:03:36,307
What an effort that must have been.

36
00:03:37,508 --> 00:03:39,208
Oh, stop that.

37
00:03:40,009 --> 00:03:42,309
Well, it might work out.

38
00:03:42,310 --> 00:03:45,610
You married all of them, the chorus girl, the widow...

39
00:03:45,611 --> 00:03:48,611
Who told you...
Oh, it's a secret. Nobody knows but me...

40
00:03:48,612 --> 00:03:50,412
and the Associated Press.

41
00:03:51,413 --> 00:03:56,113
Well, I haven't offered to marry anyone else.

42
00:03:56,114 --> 00:03:57,614
No? Why not?

43
00:03:57,815 --> 00:03:59,515
Well, because I...

44
00:04:00,416 --> 00:04:02,216
Because once I asked you to marry me.

45
00:04:02,217 --> 00:04:04,917
Ah, he remembers.

46
00:04:04,918 --> 00:04:08,908
I also remember there was some difficulty about um...

47
00:04:09,109 --> 00:04:10,709
setting the date.

48
00:04:12,710 --> 00:04:15,000
Thank my lucky stars.

49
00:04:16,701 --> 00:04:18,301
I'm really serious.

50
00:04:18,302 --> 00:04:20,600
I really mean it this time, Gerry.

51
00:04:20,801 --> 00:04:22,101
Mean what?

52
00:04:22,102 --> 00:04:26,302
Marriage... and all that.

53
00:04:26,303 --> 00:04:31,303
No, I'm afraid there'd be too little marriage
and too much "all that".

54
00:04:59,604 --> 00:05:02,704
Are you absolutely definite about this, Gerry?

55
00:05:03,605 --> 00:05:05,005
So definite.

56
00:05:08,806 --> 00:05:10,006
Well...

57
00:05:11,107 --> 00:05:13,207
It was beautiful while it lasted.

58
00:05:19,508 --> 00:05:20,708
Jim!

59
00:05:20,709 --> 00:05:22,009
Come back!

60
00:06:22,210 --> 00:06:24,010
Take these designs to the shop.

61
00:06:24,011 --> 00:06:26,311
I've made the changes
and they can start on them at once.

62
00:06:29,112 --> 00:06:33,712
Oh, yes. And tell Miss Curtis Mrs. Hoffman's gown
must be ready this evening.

63
00:06:33,713 --> 00:06:35,900
That's Buster Collins on the phone.

64
00:06:38,301 --> 00:06:41,001
And tell them I'll be over early in the morning.

65
00:06:41,002 --> 00:06:43,602
What time?
Twelve o'clock.

66
00:06:48,103 --> 00:06:50,103
Hello, Buster.
Hello, Gerry.

67
00:06:50,104 --> 00:06:53,414
Can I come over?
And bring a friend?

68
00:06:53,415 --> 00:06:55,805
I'm not dressed.
Who is it?

69
00:06:55,806 --> 00:06:57,206
Tony Blake.

70
00:06:57,207 --> 00:06:59,207
Tony Blake?

71
00:06:59,708 --> 00:07:01,008
Oh!

72
00:07:01,009 --> 00:07:04,809
Tony Blake, of course. Bring him along.
I'd like to meet him.

73
00:07:04,810 --> 00:07:07,210
Tell him I think his book is wonderful.

74
00:07:07,211 --> 00:07:09,600
But don't tell him I haven't finished it.

75
00:07:11,601 --> 00:07:13,401
Why does he want to meet me?

76
00:07:13,502 --> 00:07:14,802
I  don't know.

77
00:07:15,103 --> 00:07:16,703
Get him to tell you.

78
00:07:17,604 --> 00:07:20,104
You'll have to have something to talk about.

79
00:07:22,005 --> 00:07:23,605
Oh, alright.

80
00:07:27,806 --> 00:07:29,006
Hey, Tony!

81
00:07:29,007 --> 00:07:30,107
What?

82
00:07:30,908 --> 00:07:33,700
It's all set.
Great!

83
00:07:40,409 --> 00:07:43,209
Oh, Aunt Kate, I'm going to meet Anthony Blake.

84
00:07:43,210 --> 00:07:46,210
What's so good about that?
He's the one who wrote this book.

85
00:07:46,211 --> 00:07:49,211
Any idiot can write a book.
Hm-hmm. Not a good one.

86
00:07:49,212 --> 00:07:51,712
Oh, I can hardly wait to meet him.

87
00:07:51,713 --> 00:07:54,013
You'd better take your shower and cool off a bit.

88
00:07:56,414 --> 00:07:59,814
Aunt Kate, put a tune on the piano for me.
I want music!

89
00:08:20,015 --> 00:08:22,315
Well, anyway, the boy gets the girl in the end.

90
00:08:22,316 --> 00:08:26,006
My, what an unusual finish.

91
00:08:27,407 --> 00:08:29,807
Hurry up, now. Get in, get in.

92
00:08:34,708 --> 00:08:38,008
Why get so excited over a man
before you've even met him?

93
00:08:39,309 --> 00:08:43,209
I hope he's a little man with a frock coat
and a beard.

94
00:08:43,210 --> 00:08:44,610
Can't you hear me?

95
00:08:47,011 --> 00:08:51,301
What I'd like to say is if I don't like him,
I'll run him out of here.

96
00:08:51,702 --> 00:08:54,102
Oh, you will, will you?

97
00:08:56,003 --> 00:08:59,103
Now that you can hear so well
I'll turn on the cold water.

98
00:09:04,704 --> 00:09:07,004
I still like him even after a cold shower.

99
00:09:09,000 --> 00:09:11,405
If he's anything like his book, he's wonderful.

100
00:09:11,406 --> 00:09:13,606
They never are, dearie.

101
00:09:14,407 --> 00:09:17,707
I once knew Buffalo Bill.

102
00:09:36,408 --> 00:09:42,808
Most things in life I've plenty of.

103
00:09:42,809 --> 00:09:47,000
What good's this, that or the other

104
00:09:47,001 --> 00:09:50,401
if you haven't got love.

105
00:09:50,402 --> 00:09:54,302
Three meals a day

106
00:09:54,903 --> 00:09:58,003
a roof above

107
00:09:58,004 --> 00:10:02,700
What good's this, that or the other

108
00:10:02,701 --> 00:10:06,101
if you haven't got love.

109
00:10:06,102 --> 00:10:12,602
Life is sweet, but love provides the zest of it

110
00:10:14,003 --> 00:10:19,773
Give me love and you can keep the rest of it

111
00:10:19,774 --> 00:10:22,174
I'll have the best of it.

112
00:10:22,775 --> 00:10:30,175
For love and joy go hand in glove

113
00:10:30,176 --> 00:10:35,076
What good's this, that or the other

114
00:10:35,877 --> 00:10:40,877
If you haven't got love.

115
00:10:40,878 --> 00:10:44,978
Mrs. Kate Smith, Miss Gerry Trent,
may I present Mr. Anthony Blake.

116
00:10:44,979 --> 00:10:47,000
That's great, Buster.

117
00:10:54,601 --> 00:10:55,901
Hm-hmm.

118
00:10:59,002 --> 00:11:00,202
Hm-hmm.

119
00:11:02,803 --> 00:11:03,903
Hmm!

120
00:11:05,104 --> 00:11:07,404
Hm-hmm? What does the hm-hmm mean?

121
00:11:09,501 --> 00:11:12,001
I've just decided you look even better
with your clothes on.

122
00:11:12,002 --> 00:11:14,002
What?
Didn't I explain?

123
00:11:14,003 --> 00:11:15,103
Come here.

124
00:11:17,004 --> 00:11:18,404
You see that building?

125
00:11:18,405 --> 00:11:22,200
I have an apartment there and on a clear day I see you
here on your roof taking your sun bath.

126
00:11:22,201 --> 00:11:23,801
In your bathing suit.

127
00:11:23,802 --> 00:11:26,802
I...
Oh... I know how you feel about it.

128
00:11:26,803 --> 00:11:28,503
I feel the same way.

129
00:11:29,604 --> 00:11:31,104
We should be married at once.

130
00:11:35,105 --> 00:11:37,000
You're probably gonna say
you don't know me well enough.

131
00:11:37,001 --> 00:11:39,800
So let's get acquainted.
What do you do?

132
00:11:39,801 --> 00:11:44,001
I own a shop. You know,
very smart things for very smart ladies.

133
00:11:44,002 --> 00:11:46,102
Good. Any profits?

134
00:11:46,603 --> 00:11:48,103
Not many.

135
00:11:48,104 --> 00:11:52,300
You see, I won't sell the nicest things.
I keep them to wear them myself.

136
00:11:52,301 --> 00:11:56,200
Too bad.
I thought for a minute I'd be able to quit work.

137
00:11:56,201 --> 00:11:59,700
But no matter. Now that I know you
I'm still willing to go through with it.

138
00:12:00,101 --> 00:12:02,101
Will you marry me?

139
00:12:02,102 --> 00:12:05,002
You are crazy.
Why am I crazy?

140
00:12:05,003 --> 00:12:06,603
I obey my impulse.

141
00:12:06,604 --> 00:12:09,604
Like the character in your book.
I am the character in my book.

142
00:12:09,605 --> 00:12:11,105
But let's get back to our marriage.

143
00:12:11,106 --> 00:12:15,506
Now then, if we run around together for several months,
the usual thing...

144
00:12:15,507 --> 00:12:20,307
you'd find out that I don't like carrots...
And you'd find out that I dunk my doughnuts.

145
00:12:22,208 --> 00:12:23,508
Exactly.

146
00:12:23,509 --> 00:12:26,809
It's twice as much fun marrying first
and getting acquainted afterwards.

147
00:12:26,810 --> 00:12:29,110
Have you ever done it before?

148
00:12:29,611 --> 00:12:31,511
Er... no.

149
00:12:32,212 --> 00:12:35,300
But right now I have an impulse to do it
and I always obey my impulses.

150
00:12:35,301 --> 00:12:38,401
We miss so much in life by not doing
what we're really feeling.

151
00:12:38,402 --> 00:12:41,492
Didn't you ever want to trip a waiter
when he's carrying a tray full of dishes?

152
00:12:41,493 --> 00:12:42,900
Yes!
I've done it.

153
00:12:42,901 --> 00:12:44,101
No!
It's marvelous.

154
00:12:44,102 --> 00:12:46,302
It only cost me $28.60.

155
00:12:46,303 --> 00:12:49,300
What are you doing tonight?
Why, do you want to go out and trip waiters?

156
00:12:49,301 --> 00:12:51,901
Yes!
I'd rather ring doorbells and run.

157
00:12:51,902 --> 00:12:54,102
Oh, the fun we're going to have together.

158
00:12:56,703 --> 00:12:58,900
That's just what I wanted to know.

159
00:12:58,901 --> 00:13:02,999
A good woman.
I'm sorry, sir. Not many of us left out there.

160
00:13:05,800 --> 00:13:07,800
Darling!
Yes?

161
00:13:08,201 --> 00:13:11,001
Joan must be sailing for home about now.

162
00:13:11,002 --> 00:13:12,002
What?

163
00:13:12,003 --> 00:13:15,203
I said your sister Joan must be sailing
from France about now.

164
00:13:15,204 --> 00:13:16,704
That's right.
Oh!

165
00:13:17,405 --> 00:13:18,805
What time is it?

166
00:13:18,806 --> 00:13:22,606
Four fifteen.
Four fifteen here...

167
00:13:24,007 --> 00:13:25,607
Over there it must be...

168
00:13:27,208 --> 00:13:29,408
Nine fifteen.
We're away on time.

169
00:13:37,709 --> 00:13:40,309
I'll be so glad to get home to see
sis and Aunt Kate.

170
00:13:41,610 --> 00:13:43,510
How long since you've seen your sister?

171
00:13:43,511 --> 00:13:45,111
It's been two years.

172
00:13:45,112 --> 00:13:48,012
And then just for a few days.
I'm away over here to school.

173
00:13:48,013 --> 00:13:50,113
You see, I lived with my aunt in Oklahoma.

174
00:13:50,114 --> 00:13:51,114
Oh!

175
00:13:52,415 --> 00:13:54,215
You think a lot of your sister, don't you?

176
00:13:54,216 --> 00:13:56,216
Everyone who knows her loves her.

177
00:13:56,917 --> 00:13:59,700
I could never tell you how wonderful
she's been to me.

178
00:13:59,701 --> 00:14:02,999
She works so hard to pay
for my schooling over here and...

179
00:14:03,000 --> 00:14:07,300
Oh, don't get me started on the subject of Gerry
or I'll talk all the way home.

180
00:14:09,301 --> 00:14:15,601
How well did you know her?
Oh, well, it was just one of those things.

181
00:14:15,802 --> 00:14:17,802
I remember her alright.

182
00:14:19,003 --> 00:14:21,203
But I don't know if she'll remember me.

183
00:14:21,204 --> 00:14:23,904
Wouldn't she be surprised if she knew
we were engaged?

184
00:14:25,805 --> 00:14:27,905
Don't forget. That's our secret.

185
00:14:45,706 --> 00:14:47,900
You can't feel happy as you look.

186
00:14:47,901 --> 00:14:50,000
I've never been so happy.

187
00:14:50,001 --> 00:14:52,601
I'm falling more in love with him every day.

188
00:14:54,202 --> 00:14:56,202
But it can't go on.

189
00:14:56,503 --> 00:14:58,703
For heaven's sake, why not?

190
00:15:02,304 --> 00:15:04,504
I've got to tell him, you know,

191
00:15:04,505 --> 00:15:06,305
about Jim.

192
00:15:06,306 --> 00:15:08,406
Now, don't be a fool.

193
00:15:08,407 --> 00:15:11,107
That's the one sure way of losing him.

194
00:15:11,108 --> 00:15:15,008
I know. But I won't feel right unless I tell him.

195
00:15:15,009 --> 00:15:17,409
You'll probably feel worse if you do.

196
00:15:18,810 --> 00:15:20,510
Think it over carefully.

197
00:15:21,311 --> 00:15:26,911
Well, I guess I'm just a modern girl
with an old-fashioned conscience.

198
00:15:41,002 --> 00:15:42,712
Press this for me?
Hm?

199
00:15:46,113 --> 00:15:47,313
Bye.

200
00:15:58,414 --> 00:15:59,714
Well, here we are.

201
00:15:59,715 --> 00:16:01,415
And just in time.

202
00:16:05,016 --> 00:16:06,116
There you are.

203
00:16:08,317 --> 00:16:09,717
Let go!
Hm-hmm.

204
00:16:09,718 --> 00:16:11,000
I want to turn on the light.

205
00:16:11,001 --> 00:16:13,101
Keep me with you. I'm afraid of the dark.

206
00:16:13,102 --> 00:16:14,902
Alright.

207
00:16:20,123 --> 00:16:21,503
Still scared?
Hm-hmm.

208
00:16:26,904 --> 00:16:28,504
Still scared?
A little.

209
00:16:29,305 --> 00:16:30,705
Should we have some music?

210
00:16:31,700 --> 00:16:33,306
Pick a station.

211
00:16:33,407 --> 00:16:36,207
<i>... as a baby swallows the pill thinking it's candy.</i>

212
00:16:44,308 --> 00:16:45,908
Still scared?

213
00:16:48,309 --> 00:16:50,109
Now a little fire and everything's set.

214
00:17:01,210 --> 00:17:02,310
I think your feet are wet.

215
00:17:02,311 --> 00:17:04,111
No, they're not.
They might be.

216
00:17:04,112 --> 00:17:06,612
I didn't step in a puddle.
Well, let's see.

217
00:17:11,113 --> 00:17:12,613
Are they warm now?
Hm-hmm.

218
00:17:18,714 --> 00:17:19,914
Ow!

219
00:17:19,915 --> 00:17:23,115
What's wrong?
Better get a shoehorn.

220
00:17:27,616 --> 00:17:28,816
Here we are.

221
00:17:39,217 --> 00:17:40,617
There we are.

222
00:17:40,618 --> 00:17:43,218
An inventor as well as a writer.

223
00:17:43,219 --> 00:17:45,119
You know, Blake.

224
00:17:45,520 --> 00:17:48,120
Let Dr. Blake read your palm.

225
00:17:50,521 --> 00:17:51,721
You'll live.

226
00:17:52,022 --> 00:17:54,022
I wonder when I'm with you.

227
00:17:54,023 --> 00:17:56,323
I'm the one who's just begun to live.

228
00:18:01,424 --> 00:18:03,400
I wish I'd met you years ago.

229
00:18:05,401 --> 00:18:07,301
I wish you had.

230
00:18:11,502 --> 00:18:13,702
You didn't have as much fun today.

231
00:18:14,403 --> 00:18:15,803
What's wrong?

232
00:18:18,004 --> 00:18:19,204
Nothing.

233
00:18:21,405 --> 00:18:24,105
Aren't you going to autograph one of your books for me?

234
00:18:24,106 --> 00:18:25,706
Right now.

235
00:18:57,807 --> 00:18:58,807
Wait a minute!

236
00:18:58,808 --> 00:19:00,408
Don't peek.

237
00:19:16,009 --> 00:19:17,809
Tony.
Hm?

238
00:19:17,810 --> 00:19:19,710
Do you believe in everything in that book?

239
00:19:19,711 --> 00:19:21,200
Of course not.

240
00:19:22,201 --> 00:19:24,801
But you said you were the central character.

241
00:19:24,802 --> 00:19:27,002
Wouldn't you do as he did?

242
00:19:27,703 --> 00:19:29,403
Well, I try to.

243
00:19:29,404 --> 00:19:33,304
You see, he's me. Idealized, of course.

244
00:19:49,705 --> 00:19:51,705
That's beautiful, Tony.

245
00:19:52,606 --> 00:19:55,006
So you love me more each hour.

246
00:19:55,007 --> 00:19:57,707
Until you're a hundred.

247
00:19:59,999 --> 00:20:02,008
After that I may start chasing around.

248
00:20:05,009 --> 00:20:08,109
I'll always treasure this.
I'll dedicate the next one to you.

249
00:20:08,110 --> 00:20:10,310
I'd love to write it in Paris...

250
00:20:11,011 --> 00:20:12,211
now...

251
00:20:13,712 --> 00:20:15,812
if I had a wife to go with me.

252
00:20:16,613 --> 00:20:19,000
Sort of a satirist critic.

253
00:20:19,999 --> 00:20:23,101
I have an idea for your new novel.

254
00:20:25,602 --> 00:20:26,702
Really?

255
00:20:27,603 --> 00:20:28,603
Yes.

256
00:20:30,604 --> 00:20:33,204
You should call it "Love and Kisses."

257
00:20:33,705 --> 00:20:37,205
And you could point out the difference between love

258
00:20:38,106 --> 00:20:39,996
and just kisses.

259
00:20:43,000 --> 00:20:45,197
Hey, that's not bad.

260
00:20:46,098 --> 00:20:48,198
Suppose by way of plot...

261
00:20:49,000 --> 00:20:51,499
a girl who's had an affair with one man

262
00:20:53,100 --> 00:20:55,000
falls in love with another.

263
00:20:55,001 --> 00:20:56,901
Should she tell him?

264
00:20:57,102 --> 00:20:59,202
That all depends on the man.

265
00:20:59,903 --> 00:21:02,303
Supposing you were like the character in your book?

266
00:21:02,304 --> 00:21:05,000
Oh, I see. Well...

267
00:21:05,001 --> 00:21:08,101
it might be better for her to tell him
than to let him find out for himself.

268
00:21:08,102 --> 00:21:09,600
That's what I thought...

269
00:21:09,601 --> 00:21:12,101
On the other hand it might be wise for her
to say nothing.

270
00:21:12,102 --> 00:21:15,202
What a man doesn't know won't hurt him.

271
00:21:17,403 --> 00:21:21,203
I guess if everybody told the truth,
nobody would marry anybody.

272
00:21:21,204 --> 00:21:24,704
Then honesty isn't the best policy.
Rarely.

273
00:21:24,705 --> 00:21:28,205
The modern baby face looks up
at the chump she's going to marry and says:

274
00:21:29,006 --> 00:21:31,406
"You're the only one I ever loved."

275
00:21:31,407 --> 00:21:34,900
and the big sap says, "Yeah?"

276
00:21:36,301 --> 00:21:38,301
And they live happily ever after.

277
00:21:41,302 --> 00:21:42,802
Oh, I don't know.

278
00:21:44,603 --> 00:21:47,703
It's hard to say what a girl should do
who's faced with that situation.

279
00:21:48,404 --> 00:21:51,004
But I am, Tony.
You're what?

280
00:21:51,005 --> 00:21:53,805
Faced with that situation.

281
00:22:24,106 --> 00:22:25,606
Did you love him?

282
00:22:26,107 --> 00:22:27,707
Tell me.

283
00:22:27,708 --> 00:22:29,508
If you loved him, I'll die.

284
00:22:29,509 --> 00:22:33,709
I only thought I did.
Don't you see, I had to think I did.

285
00:22:35,110 --> 00:22:37,000
I don't want to know anything about him.

286
00:22:38,001 --> 00:22:39,900
I don't even want to know who he is.

287
00:22:43,801 --> 00:22:45,801
Just promise me you'll never see him again.

288
00:22:45,802 --> 00:22:47,302
Have no fear of that.

289
00:22:56,503 --> 00:22:57,703
Gerry...

290
00:23:00,004 --> 00:23:01,800
I have a confession to make.

291
00:23:02,701 --> 00:23:04,201
Once I...

292
00:23:07,302 --> 00:23:08,902
went out with a girl.

293
00:23:08,903 --> 00:23:10,403
That makes us even.

294
00:23:12,404 --> 00:23:14,604
Oh, Tony!

295
00:23:16,505 --> 00:23:19,300
In spite of my great mistake, will you marry me?

296
00:23:20,001 --> 00:23:22,500
I'd like to see anything stop me.

297
00:23:31,501 --> 00:23:32,801
Oh, sweetheart...

298
00:23:38,202 --> 00:23:41,102
I'd better go.
Oh, why? It's raining.

299
00:23:41,103 --> 00:23:42,703
No, it isn't. It's stopped.

300
00:23:44,904 --> 00:23:47,704
And my... and my sister comes in tomorrow.

301
00:23:47,705 --> 00:23:51,855
And I have to meet her.
And besides, I have some letters to write.

302
00:23:51,856 --> 00:23:55,006
Those aren't reasons.
Well, they'll do. Goodbye.

303
00:23:55,007 --> 00:23:56,607
Wait, I'll go with you.

304
00:24:46,108 --> 00:24:47,608
I forgot my book.

305
00:24:51,909 --> 00:24:53,009
Tony.

306
00:24:53,010 --> 00:24:56,600
You didn't change what you had written, did you?

307
00:24:56,601 --> 00:24:58,601
Yes, a little.

308
00:24:59,202 --> 00:25:00,302
Oh...

309
00:25:01,803 --> 00:25:03,503
I want it.

310
00:25:03,504 --> 00:25:05,104
Give it to me.

311
00:25:13,805 --> 00:25:16,100
Give it to me, please.

312
00:26:05,001 --> 00:26:08,201
Well, hello, miss Joan.
Hello, Helga.

313
00:26:10,002 --> 00:26:13,202
Oh, Joan.
Oh, and you don't know how good it looks to me.

314
00:26:13,203 --> 00:26:17,003
I'm so happy.
I'm going to help unpack your things.

315
00:26:17,004 --> 00:26:18,004
Okay.

316
00:26:18,005 --> 00:26:21,005
Oh, Aunt Kate, New York is so different from Paris.

317
00:26:21,006 --> 00:26:22,806
Your trunks will be here in about an hour.

318
00:26:26,507 --> 00:26:29,007
Gee, it's great to see you, baby.

319
00:26:31,008 --> 00:26:32,608
Hey, what's the matter?

320
00:26:32,609 --> 00:26:36,609
Please, Buster. I have to unpack and everything.

321
00:26:38,710 --> 00:26:40,510
Aren't you glad to see me?

322
00:26:40,811 --> 00:26:43,311
Of course I'm glad to see you.

323
00:26:43,312 --> 00:26:45,612
But...
But what?

324
00:26:46,313 --> 00:26:48,313
Quit being so young.

325
00:26:48,314 --> 00:26:51,514
I'm a year older than you are.
Well, then act it.

326
00:26:52,115 --> 00:26:57,915
It was rather silly to think that things
would be the same between us after two years.

327
00:26:59,316 --> 00:27:00,616
You're kidding.

328
00:27:01,717 --> 00:27:02,717
Why aren't you coming?

329
00:27:02,718 --> 00:27:05,718
It was nice of you to want to give me a party.

330
00:27:05,719 --> 00:27:07,819
But you really shouldn't do it.

331
00:27:11,320 --> 00:27:13,320
Aunt Gerry, help me out.

332
00:27:13,321 --> 00:27:17,521
She's giving me the chills.
Says she doesn't want to go to my party.

333
00:27:17,722 --> 00:27:20,222
What's the matter? Won't you go?

334
00:27:21,623 --> 00:27:24,523
There you are, my lad.
From now on it's up to you.

335
00:27:25,524 --> 00:27:27,324
See you about seven-thirty?

336
00:27:30,325 --> 00:27:31,425
Alright.

337
00:27:31,526 --> 00:27:33,226
And you and Tony?

338
00:27:35,027 --> 00:27:36,827
And you too, Mrs. Brown.

339
00:27:48,128 --> 00:27:51,228
I can't get over it. The way you've grown.

340
00:27:51,229 --> 00:27:53,729
It was only yesterday I was looking at these.

341
00:27:53,730 --> 00:27:54,730
Look.

342
00:28:00,131 --> 00:28:03,831
There you are, before going to Paris.
Before and after.

343
00:28:09,532 --> 00:28:12,032
What the well-dressed baby used to wear.

344
00:28:30,333 --> 00:28:32,033
That reminds me.

345
00:28:33,334 --> 00:28:35,334
I promised to look after you.

346
00:28:39,835 --> 00:28:42,935
Sometimes I worried about you being
out of my sight for so long.

347
00:28:47,636 --> 00:28:49,236
You didn't have to.

348
00:28:50,437 --> 00:28:52,137
I couldn't help it.

349
00:28:57,038 --> 00:28:59,638
I hope we have as much fun here
as we had in Oklahoma.

350
00:28:59,639 --> 00:29:03,439
Do you remember the night
you went out with Stu Gordell?

351
00:29:04,440 --> 00:29:07,140
He came in in a car that just chugged along.

352
00:29:07,141 --> 00:29:09,241
And he made you get out and walk.

353
00:29:09,642 --> 00:29:11,842
And even at that I beat him home.

354
00:29:17,043 --> 00:29:19,943
What's that?
I was wondering if you remembered.

355
00:29:19,944 --> 00:29:21,744
Of course I do.

356
00:29:22,205 --> 00:29:23,945
Don't tell me.

357
00:29:25,006 --> 00:29:26,946
Don't tell me.

358
00:29:27,647 --> 00:29:32,699
I need you now so keep your vow...
That's the last part of it.

359
00:29:34,000 --> 00:29:36,100
I remember it. It's the SOS.

360
00:29:36,801 --> 00:29:41,201
When you had a beau of the ball
and he'd get too "beau-ish"

361
00:29:41,202 --> 00:29:44,602
you'd sing this, which was my signal
to come in and say...

362
00:29:44,603 --> 00:29:47,003
'Geraldine, bedtime.'

363
00:29:47,804 --> 00:29:50,304
You saved my life many times.

364
00:29:50,305 --> 00:29:51,805
Start over.

365
00:29:54,506 --> 00:29:59,306
If you can hear me calling, dear

366
00:29:59,507 --> 00:30:04,007
Come to me, come to me

367
00:30:04,008 --> 00:30:10,008
My life, my love, my all.

368
00:30:10,009 --> 00:30:11,209
Come on, sing.

369
00:30:11,210 --> 00:30:16,210
From near or far wherever you are

370
00:30:16,211 --> 00:30:21,011
come to me, come to me

371
00:30:21,012 --> 00:30:28,112
in answer to my call.

372
00:30:28,113 --> 00:30:32,213
Somewhere on a hill

373
00:30:32,214 --> 00:30:36,014
there's a whippoorwill

374
00:30:36,015 --> 00:30:44,815
calling with me as the shadows fall.

375
00:30:44,816 --> 00:30:50,916
I need you now so keep your vow

376
00:30:50,917 --> 00:30:56,817
Come to me, come to me

377
00:30:56,818 --> 00:31:00,118
My life...

378
00:31:00,119 --> 00:31:03,419
my love...

379
00:31:03,420 --> 00:31:08,820
My all.

380
00:31:12,721 --> 00:31:17,521
You'll never hear me calling, dear...

381
00:31:17,522 --> 00:31:19,000
when he's here.

382
00:31:19,001 --> 00:31:20,900
Oh, he's good looking.

383
00:31:20,901 --> 00:31:24,301
Who is he?
Anthony Blake, the novelist.

384
00:31:24,302 --> 00:31:28,002
And your future brother-in-law.

385
00:31:28,003 --> 00:31:30,703
No!
Yes, it's terrific.

386
00:31:30,704 --> 00:31:32,800
You'll meet him tonight.

387
00:31:32,801 --> 00:31:35,101
Oh, you, you poor darling.

388
00:31:35,102 --> 00:31:39,302
You've been in the convent so long
I suppose you forgot what boys look like.

389
00:31:39,303 --> 00:31:42,403
I have. All except one.
He hasn't forgotten you either.

390
00:31:42,404 --> 00:31:45,504
I don't mean Buster.
No?

391
00:31:45,555 --> 00:31:48,405
No, this one I met in Paris.
I think you know him, too.

392
00:31:49,406 --> 00:31:51,306
Who is he?
Jim Woodward.

393
00:31:52,407 --> 00:31:54,000
Don't you know him?

394
00:31:56,001 --> 00:31:59,000
Yes, I'm trying to place him.

395
00:31:59,001 --> 00:32:01,001
He said you might not remember him.

396
00:32:01,002 --> 00:32:05,002
Oh, Gerry, he wears the cutest clothes,
says the most adorable things...

397
00:32:05,003 --> 00:32:06,903
and dances divinely.

398
00:32:06,904 --> 00:32:09,104
If you ever met him you'd remember him.

399
00:32:09,105 --> 00:32:11,005
I remember him...

400
00:32:11,306 --> 00:32:12,906
vaguely.

401
00:32:13,807 --> 00:32:18,507
Well... I suppose you want a manicure
and a wave for tonight.

402
00:32:18,508 --> 00:32:20,408
I'll go with you. I need one, too.

403
00:32:20,409 --> 00:32:24,000
And you must wear one of your new Paris gowns
to Buster's party.

404
00:32:24,001 --> 00:32:26,501
It'll be a wonderful party, it really will.

405
00:32:29,702 --> 00:32:32,102
What a party I'm giving.

406
00:32:53,003 --> 00:32:56,703
I asked a friend of mine to drop in at the party.
I hope you won't mind.

407
00:32:56,704 --> 00:33:00,004
It's great. What's her name.

408
00:33:00,005 --> 00:33:02,005
Jim Woodward.

409
00:33:06,206 --> 00:33:09,006
Swell. Someone for Aunt Kate.

410
00:33:10,607 --> 00:33:12,107
Yes.

411
00:33:15,008 --> 00:33:16,608
Shall we tell them about us?

412
00:33:17,509 --> 00:33:18,309
Why?

413
00:33:19,210 --> 00:33:21,110
I want to pin you down in public.

414
00:33:25,711 --> 00:33:27,211
Why not?

415
00:33:28,612 --> 00:33:29,812
Not now.

416
00:33:31,513 --> 00:33:32,813
Hello, Joan.

417
00:33:33,414 --> 00:33:34,500
Hello.

418
00:33:35,701 --> 00:33:37,601
You remember Mr. Woodward.

419
00:33:38,802 --> 00:33:40,202
Gerry!

420
00:33:41,103 --> 00:33:43,103
And more beautiful than ever.

421
00:33:47,204 --> 00:33:49,404
Meet me, Mr. Woodward.
Tony Blake.

422
00:33:49,405 --> 00:33:52,305
I'm the fellow who's supposed to make
all the pretty speeches to Gerry.

423
00:33:53,406 --> 00:33:55,106
And my aunt, Mrs. Smith.

424
00:33:55,507 --> 00:33:56,907
How do you do?

425
00:33:57,508 --> 00:33:58,808
How do you do?

426
00:33:58,809 --> 00:34:00,609
And Mr. Collins.

427
00:34:00,710 --> 00:34:03,010
Mr. Collins.
Hello.

428
00:34:18,411 --> 00:34:20,511
Have a drink, Woodward?
Yes, thanks.

429
00:34:36,612 --> 00:34:38,412
What a party I'm giving.

430
00:34:43,513 --> 00:34:45,013
Well, here's to...

431
00:34:46,514 --> 00:34:48,314
Well, what shall we drink to?

432
00:34:52,515 --> 00:34:54,315
I have something important to drink to.

433
00:34:54,316 --> 00:34:57,216
The minute I laid eyes on Gerry Trent

434
00:34:57,217 --> 00:34:59,117
I wanted to be her slave.

435
00:34:59,118 --> 00:35:02,218
I offered my services as a chauffeur.

436
00:35:02,219 --> 00:35:04,319
She said, no, i drive myself.

437
00:35:04,320 --> 00:35:06,420
I said, what about a secretary?

438
00:35:06,421 --> 00:35:10,021
She said no, I handle all my correspondence myself.

439
00:35:10,022 --> 00:35:13,622
No matter what I suggested, it seemed she didn't need me.

440
00:35:15,023 --> 00:35:18,223
Then one day I remarked that she might like to um...

441
00:35:18,224 --> 00:35:20,024
marry and um...

442
00:35:21,125 --> 00:35:23,625
raise a family.

443
00:35:24,426 --> 00:35:26,326
P.S. I got the job.

444
00:35:26,327 --> 00:35:28,007
I go to work Monday.

445
00:35:28,008 --> 00:35:32,008
Hey, congratulations.
Thanks, Buster.

446
00:35:36,209 --> 00:35:38,009
Likewise.
Thanks.

447
00:35:43,810 --> 00:35:46,110
Here's hoping you'll never discharge.

448
00:35:46,311 --> 00:35:48,211
Thanks, ol' man.

449
00:35:52,712 --> 00:35:55,212
May I dance with the bride, please?
Of course.

450
00:35:55,813 --> 00:35:57,113
Gerry.

451
00:36:29,114 --> 00:36:30,414
Can I be best man?

452
00:36:31,915 --> 00:36:34,115
He's the best man I ever knew.

453
00:36:36,416 --> 00:36:37,516
Isn't that nice?

454
00:36:41,317 --> 00:36:43,117
Roses round the door...

455
00:36:43,118 --> 00:36:44,718
kiddies on the floor...

456
00:36:44,819 --> 00:36:46,709
Are you gonna go for that?

457
00:36:46,710 --> 00:36:48,810
Why not? I love him.

458
00:36:57,000 --> 00:37:00,711
It just doesn't mean anything,
you and Joan, does it?

459
00:37:03,312 --> 00:37:04,712
Why?

460
00:37:04,713 --> 00:37:06,613
You know why.

461
00:37:09,314 --> 00:37:11,214
Just laughs. I met her on the boat.

462
00:37:13,715 --> 00:37:15,315
She's only a child.

463
00:37:15,316 --> 00:37:18,116
I think she's getting a bit serious.

464
00:37:18,617 --> 00:37:20,417
See that she doesn't.

465
00:37:21,818 --> 00:37:25,718
You know me.
Just too well.

466
00:37:34,219 --> 00:37:36,219
And guess who it was.

467
00:37:36,220 --> 00:37:38,120
Buffalo Bill.

468
00:37:50,921 --> 00:37:52,721
Now's a good time to invite them.

469
00:37:53,522 --> 00:37:56,002
Where?
To your home.

470
00:37:56,003 --> 00:37:59,303
Our families should meet sometime
if we're going to be married.

471
00:38:01,404 --> 00:38:03,004
There's plenty of time for that.

472
00:38:03,005 --> 00:38:06,105
But you said you'd arrange it as soon as you got back.

473
00:38:10,506 --> 00:38:11,900
Attention, please.

474
00:38:16,401 --> 00:38:18,001
Stand by for a station announcement.

475
00:38:18,702 --> 00:38:22,302
I'm giving a big week-end party in my father's name

476
00:38:22,303 --> 00:38:24,303
at Westbury and I want you all to come.

477
00:38:25,004 --> 00:38:27,404
And maybe you'll get a surprise too.

478
00:38:29,505 --> 00:38:31,805
I bet I know. Another engagement.

479
00:38:31,806 --> 00:38:34,006
Well, it's something to drink to anyway.

480
00:39:11,007 --> 00:39:13,807
Why didn't you tell me we weren't going
to the Woodwards...

481
00:39:13,908 --> 00:39:15,608
before I got all dressed up?

482
00:39:15,609 --> 00:39:19,209
I'm sorry, Aunt Kate. We shouldn't go
and Joan shouldn't go either.

483
00:39:19,210 --> 00:39:22,110
It's bound to be an awkward situation for all of us.

484
00:39:23,011 --> 00:39:25,811
Well, on second thought, perhaps you're right.

485
00:39:25,812 --> 00:39:28,812
It might cause a lot of trouble.
Create a big scandal.

486
00:39:29,993 --> 00:39:31,600
Joan has no business.

487
00:39:32,101 --> 00:39:34,501
And from what you tell me of that Jim Woodward...

488
00:39:34,502 --> 00:39:37,002
Even I wouldn't be safe with him.

489
00:39:39,003 --> 00:39:42,903
Besides, Joan might find out about....la-da-di-da...

490
00:39:45,104 --> 00:39:47,004
What's the matter? Aren't you going?

491
00:39:48,405 --> 00:39:50,505
No. And you shouldn't go.

492
00:39:51,506 --> 00:39:53,806
But Gerry, his parents want to meet us.

493
00:39:53,807 --> 00:39:56,007
And you think he wants to marry you.

494
00:39:57,608 --> 00:39:59,008
What about Buster?

495
00:39:59,009 --> 00:40:01,909
He's just a kid. I like older men.

496
00:40:01,910 --> 00:40:04,010
Naturally you would at your age.

497
00:40:04,011 --> 00:40:05,901
What did you tell Buster?

498
00:40:05,902 --> 00:40:09,102
I had that out with him this morning.
He'll get over it.

499
00:40:09,103 --> 00:40:13,003
He's a fine boy.
You mean to imply that Jim isn't?

500
00:40:13,004 --> 00:40:17,304
Darling, you've always listened to me.
Please listen to me now.

501
00:40:18,005 --> 00:40:21,405
I know something about life.
You're only on the brink of it.

502
00:40:21,406 --> 00:40:24,006
And I want you to benefit by my experience.

503
00:40:24,007 --> 00:40:26,607
You mustn't have headaches that you can possibly avoid.

504
00:40:26,608 --> 00:40:30,408
That's why I want you to believe me when I say
Jim Woodward isn't the sort of man you should marry.

505
00:40:30,409 --> 00:40:33,809
How do you know so much about him?
You said you barely remembered him.

506
00:40:33,810 --> 00:40:38,310
I knew a girl that he went with
and how he cheated her and lots of others.

507
00:40:38,311 --> 00:40:42,401
I don't care about his others. Every man has had others.
Ask Tony.

508
00:40:42,402 --> 00:40:43,402
Joan...

509
00:40:43,403 --> 00:40:44,803
Just a moment, Aunt Kate.

510
00:40:44,804 --> 00:40:47,704
At least Jim didn't love the others.
Now that he's engaged to me...

511
00:40:47,705 --> 00:40:49,505
he's through with them all,
He told me so.

512
00:40:49,506 --> 00:40:53,006
He told you so. Would you believe
black was white if he told you so?

513
00:40:53,007 --> 00:40:55,800
I happen to know that he promised to marry
this particular girl.

514
00:40:55,801 --> 00:40:59,751
And she believed in him. All the while he was running
around with a dozen others who believed in him too.

515
00:40:59,752 --> 00:41:03,002
You have no right to talk to me like this.
I'm old enough to know what I'm doing.

516
00:41:03,153 --> 00:41:04,753
You think so?
Yes, I do.

517
00:41:04,754 --> 00:41:07,154
How do you know this girl is telling the truth about Jim?

518
00:41:07,155 --> 00:41:09,755
I wouldn't believe anything I heard
from that kind of girl.

519
00:41:09,756 --> 00:41:13,496
Oh, yes you would from this kind of girl...
No, I wouldn't. She's probably lying.

520
00:41:13,497 --> 00:41:14,697
Who is she?

521
00:41:14,698 --> 00:41:17,298
You want to know who she is?
I'll tell you who the girl is...

522
00:41:17,299 --> 00:41:19,300
Gerry, let her alone.

523
00:41:19,301 --> 00:41:22,101
Go on, Joan. Go on to Westbury.

524
00:41:22,102 --> 00:41:23,102
Marry the man you love.

525
00:41:24,103 --> 00:41:27,803
Why, you girls ought to be ashamed of yourselves.

526
00:41:27,804 --> 00:41:29,504
Quarreling like this?

527
00:41:30,305 --> 00:41:31,805
Goodbye, Joan.

528
00:41:46,806 --> 00:41:49,306
I just couldn't let you go through with it.

529
00:41:49,307 --> 00:41:50,607
You were right.

530
00:41:50,608 --> 00:41:52,708
Just give that Jim Woodward time.

531
00:41:52,709 --> 00:41:54,700
He'll open her eyes himself.

532
00:41:54,701 --> 00:41:56,401
By then it might be too late.

533
00:41:56,402 --> 00:41:58,900
Jim isn't going to be on the level with her.

534
00:41:58,901 --> 00:42:03,001
It just isn't in him.
Oh, if Joan only knew him as I know him.

535
00:42:19,902 --> 00:42:21,302
Hello, darling.

536
00:42:24,003 --> 00:42:25,603
Hello, darling.

537
00:42:25,604 --> 00:42:29,054
Everything's all set. Ten o'clock,
the little church around the corner

538
00:42:29,055 --> 00:42:31,855
then your house for food.
I'm no fool.

539
00:42:32,756 --> 00:42:35,656
Say, how much should I give the minister?

540
00:42:35,657 --> 00:42:38,357
Whatever you think it's worth, I suppose.

541
00:42:38,358 --> 00:42:40,158
I couldn't afford to pay that much.

542
00:42:42,059 --> 00:42:44,859
What are you laughing at?
The passports just got here.

543
00:42:44,860 --> 00:42:48,460
Oh, Tony, my picture!
Is it dreadful?

544
00:42:48,461 --> 00:42:50,561
We're a great pair.

545
00:42:54,762 --> 00:42:56,900
We don't look as if we're trying to get
out of the country.

546
00:42:56,901 --> 00:42:58,501
We look as if we're trying to get in.

547
00:43:00,302 --> 00:43:03,602
By the way, Gerry.
I can't go to the Woodwards.

548
00:43:03,999 --> 00:43:06,600
I've got to run down to Washington, after all.

549
00:43:06,601 --> 00:43:09,001
That's alright if you have to go.

550
00:43:09,002 --> 00:43:10,980
I'm not going either.

551
00:43:10,981 --> 00:43:12,881
You shouldn't stay home on my account.

552
00:43:12,882 --> 00:43:15,782
You ought to go anyway.
You'll probably have lots of fun.

553
00:43:16,883 --> 00:43:20,583
Don't be silly.
I couldn't have any fun without you.

554
00:43:21,784 --> 00:43:22,884
Well...

555
00:43:23,785 --> 00:43:27,085
Hurry back. I'll miss you.

556
00:43:28,186 --> 00:43:29,996
Be a good boy.

557
00:43:30,297 --> 00:43:31,797
Bye, darling.

558
00:43:42,398 --> 00:43:43,498
Aunt Kate.

559
00:43:43,499 --> 00:43:46,299
Yes?
Get ready. We're going to Westbury.

560
00:43:58,100 --> 00:44:01,600
Oh, Miss Trent,
I'm so sorry your sister-in-law couldn't come.

561
00:44:01,601 --> 00:44:04,501
I was so anxious to meet them.
I'm sorry too.

562
00:44:04,602 --> 00:44:06,252
Oh, here they are now!

563
00:44:06,253 --> 00:44:08,800
Pardon me.
Gerry!

564
00:44:08,801 --> 00:44:11,500
What a surprise. I'm glad you came.

565
00:44:12,001 --> 00:44:15,500
Why, I don't understand their coming.

566
00:44:15,501 --> 00:44:19,401
Oh, mother, Dad,
I want you to know Miss Trent.

567
00:44:19,402 --> 00:44:22,602
How do you do?
And her aunt, Mrs. um...

568
00:44:23,503 --> 00:44:26,203
Jones.
How do you do?

569
00:44:26,204 --> 00:44:28,804
Won't you come in?
Thank you.

570
00:44:39,105 --> 00:44:40,200
Hello?

571
00:44:41,001 --> 00:44:42,101
Yeah.

572
00:44:44,902 --> 00:44:46,202
You attended to it?

573
00:44:47,203 --> 00:44:50,303
Thanks a lot.
I didn't want to go to Washington anyway.

574
00:44:51,904 --> 00:44:52,804
Goodbye.

575
00:44:59,000 --> 00:45:01,105
I'm terribly sorry about you and Joan.

576
00:45:01,106 --> 00:45:03,006
I did all I could.

577
00:45:04,007 --> 00:45:06,007
But I'm defeated.

578
00:45:09,708 --> 00:45:11,508
I don't know why you're on my side.

579
00:45:11,909 --> 00:45:13,809
But I love you for it.

580
00:45:17,510 --> 00:45:22,110
After I finish these I'm going in and get Jim's ol' man
to call the whole thing off.

581
00:45:45,000 --> 00:45:46,600
I think I'm brave enough now.

582
00:45:55,101 --> 00:45:57,001
I think he's interested in Miss Trent.

583
00:45:57,102 --> 00:46:00,400
I like Joan, I like the sister.

584
00:46:00,401 --> 00:46:03,501
But that aunt...
Oh, she seems alright.

585
00:46:05,502 --> 00:46:06,702
Come in.

586
00:46:15,103 --> 00:46:16,303
How do you do?

587
00:46:17,000 --> 00:46:18,104
Hello...

588
00:46:19,505 --> 00:46:21,800
When I met you today, Mr. Woodward,

589
00:46:21,801 --> 00:46:25,201
I don't think you remembered me.
I'm the son of Timothy Collins.

590
00:46:25,202 --> 00:46:28,602
Buster Collins!
Why, we knew you when you were that high.

591
00:46:29,503 --> 00:46:31,103
Now I'm this high.

592
00:46:36,404 --> 00:46:38,404
I came in here to ask you, Mr. Woodward...

593
00:46:38,405 --> 00:46:41,405
if you knew that Jim intended to marry Joan Trent.

594
00:46:41,406 --> 00:46:45,306
No, really?
Well, we hadn't heard, but um...

595
00:46:46,000 --> 00:46:48,307
I should be really glad if it were true.

596
00:46:49,108 --> 00:46:51,999
We're anxious that Jim should settle down.

597
00:46:52,700 --> 00:46:54,800
Oh, um...

598
00:46:55,501 --> 00:46:58,700
But what do you know about these Trents?

599
00:46:58,701 --> 00:47:01,601
Nothing much.
They seem to be nice people.

600
00:47:02,702 --> 00:47:05,002
Well, not from what I heard.

601
00:47:06,203 --> 00:47:08,203
But if you're satisfied, alright.

602
00:47:08,204 --> 00:47:10,104
Buster, one moment.

603
00:47:10,305 --> 00:47:12,305
Tell us what you heard.

604
00:47:12,306 --> 00:47:16,506
Oh, it doesn't matter much.
It certainly does.

605
00:47:16,507 --> 00:47:18,207
Tell us what you know.

606
00:47:19,008 --> 00:47:21,308
Well, I heard...

607
00:47:21,309 --> 00:47:23,409
that the aunt...

608
00:47:23,410 --> 00:47:24,700
was a bootlegger.

609
00:47:24,701 --> 00:47:27,501
What did I tell you?
Nonsense. I don't believe it.

610
00:47:29,202 --> 00:47:31,900
You may not believe that
but that's not the half of it.

611
00:47:33,301 --> 00:47:37,501
Oh, but I can see you're not interested.
Buster! Just a minute!

612
00:47:37,502 --> 00:47:39,102
Tell us what you know.

613
00:47:41,003 --> 00:47:43,703
Do you want to know all?
All!

614
00:47:46,404 --> 00:47:47,504
Well,

615
00:47:48,805 --> 00:47:50,305
It's pretty bad.

616
00:47:52,006 --> 00:47:54,106
I wish I hadn't mentioned it.

617
00:47:54,107 --> 00:47:56,607
Young man! Will you speak up!

618
00:47:58,308 --> 00:47:59,400
Alright.

619
00:48:00,001 --> 00:48:01,600
You asked for it.

620
00:48:03,501 --> 00:48:07,301
Everyone that knows the Trents knows that there's a...

621
00:48:07,302 --> 00:48:12,202
dash, just a teeny weeny dash...

622
00:48:12,203 --> 00:48:14,603
of insanity in the family.

623
00:48:27,304 --> 00:48:29,004
Now I feel like a cad.

624
00:48:36,605 --> 00:48:38,105
How did you do?

625
00:48:39,306 --> 00:48:40,900
I did alright.

626
00:48:40,901 --> 00:48:42,800
What do you mean you did alright?

627
00:48:43,801 --> 00:48:47,001
I don't think there will be any Woodwards
marrying any Trents.

628
00:48:47,502 --> 00:48:48,900
Really?

629
00:48:49,301 --> 00:48:51,001
Buster, what did you say?

630
00:48:52,402 --> 00:48:54,400
I'd rather not tell you.

631
00:48:55,301 --> 00:48:56,801
You must tell me.

632
00:48:57,602 --> 00:49:00,400
I'd rather not. You might not like it.

633
00:49:00,401 --> 00:49:02,301
I swear I'll love it.

634
00:49:03,302 --> 00:49:04,802
You won't get sore now?

635
00:49:04,803 --> 00:49:06,600
Cross my heart.

636
00:49:06,601 --> 00:49:08,801
Well, I told...

637
00:49:14,799 --> 00:49:18,402
Now, Buster, out with it, out with it.

638
00:49:19,103 --> 00:49:21,103
Well, I told them...

639
00:49:22,204 --> 00:49:24,600
I told them that there was a dash

640
00:49:25,401 --> 00:49:28,900
just a teeny weeney weeney dash

641
00:49:28,901 --> 00:49:30,801
of... of...

642
00:49:30,802 --> 00:49:32,700
insanity in your family.

643
00:49:33,201 --> 00:49:35,801
Buster! Ohhh...

644
00:49:36,602 --> 00:49:38,700
Oh, that's awful.

645
00:49:38,701 --> 00:49:42,401
I said there was just a teeny weeny dash...

646
00:50:53,703 --> 00:50:54,999
Thank you.

647
00:51:06,100 --> 00:51:08,000
Those are embarrassing crackers.

648
00:51:08,701 --> 00:51:11,401
You know, you can get a kind that won't break.

649
00:51:11,402 --> 00:51:14,302
Of course you can't eat them.
But you can butter them.

650
00:51:17,003 --> 00:51:18,103
What's the matter?

651
00:51:18,104 --> 00:51:19,404
Nothing.

652
00:51:19,405 --> 00:51:21,305
Aren't you going to have your consommée?

653
00:51:22,406 --> 00:51:23,806
Consommée?

654
00:51:23,807 --> 00:51:26,007
Why, I thought it was soup.

655
00:51:31,508 --> 00:51:33,208
Would you pass the sugar?

656
00:51:34,409 --> 00:51:35,609
Please.

657
00:51:35,610 --> 00:51:37,410
Sugar?
Sugar.

658
00:51:41,411 --> 00:51:42,611
Thank you.

659
00:51:44,812 --> 00:51:47,402
One, two...
Button my shoe!

660
00:51:45,003 --> 00:51:49,999
Three, four...
Shut the door!

661
00:51:50,000 --> 00:51:53,300
Five, six...
Pardon me!

662
00:51:54,401 --> 00:51:56,301
Do you realize that's sugar?

663
00:51:56,302 --> 00:51:59,102
Oh, yes...
Oh, yes, I've heard of that before.

664
00:51:59,103 --> 00:52:01,003
I'll bet you love it!

665
00:52:03,104 --> 00:52:04,904
Say when.
When! When!

666
00:52:05,405 --> 00:52:07,405
What's the matter?
Nothing.

667
00:52:20,506 --> 00:52:22,806
What are you looking at?
Nothing.

668
00:52:30,207 --> 00:52:32,207
What do you want?
Nothing.

669
00:52:43,008 --> 00:52:44,408
What's the matter?
Nothing.

670
00:52:53,509 --> 00:52:56,309
What are you laughing at?
Nothing!

671
00:53:15,210 --> 00:53:18,610
Aunt Kate, I have news for you.
Mr. Woodward and you...

672
00:53:18,611 --> 00:53:20,011
Buffalo Bill.

673
00:54:05,212 --> 00:54:07,412
Why did you call me?
I've hardly had a drop of my lunch.

674
00:54:07,413 --> 00:54:11,013
What do you mean by inviting these Trents
to our house? They're crazy.

675
00:54:12,514 --> 00:54:14,414
Why, isn't the rest of our guests?

676
00:54:14,415 --> 00:54:17,515
Absolutely mad, I tell you.
They stand out.

677
00:54:19,716 --> 00:54:21,816
Oh, you mustn't say that.

678
00:54:25,017 --> 00:54:28,517
Go up and quiet her down.
Order a straitjacket. Do something!

679
00:54:28,518 --> 00:54:30,400
All right, all right.

680
00:54:32,001 --> 00:54:34,101
Didn't you know Buffalo Bill?

681
00:54:41,402 --> 00:54:44,402
Hold on. I think I'll finish lunch in my bathing suit.

682
00:54:44,403 --> 00:54:46,503
That ought to convince them.

683
00:54:55,304 --> 00:54:56,704
Why, hello, Collins.

684
00:54:57,705 --> 00:54:59,900
What are you doing in this lady's bedroom?

685
00:55:02,001 --> 00:55:04,301
What are you doing in this house?

686
00:55:09,002 --> 00:55:11,002
When I think of the answer to that I'll be back.

687
00:55:14,003 --> 00:55:15,303
Gerry!

688
00:55:17,704 --> 00:55:22,404
Well, if it isn't Mr. James.
What's going on here, what are you up to?

689
00:55:22,405 --> 00:55:24,805
Nothing, nothing.
I've given up!

690
00:55:24,806 --> 00:55:28,606
Let anybody marry anybody.
You're the winner. Jim Woodward the winner!

691
00:55:28,607 --> 00:55:30,407
Hurrah for Jim Woodward!

692
00:55:30,408 --> 00:55:32,888
My old man is terribly upset.

693
00:55:32,889 --> 00:55:37,689
He thinks you're crazy.
Crazy? Why, I only obey my impulses, that's all.

694
00:55:37,690 --> 00:55:39,090
What are you talking about?

695
00:55:39,091 --> 00:55:41,771
We miss so much in life by not doing
the things we want to do.

696
00:55:41,772 --> 00:55:44,272
If you feel like doing something,
why shouldn't you do it?

697
00:55:44,273 --> 00:55:45,573
For instance?

698
00:55:45,574 --> 00:55:49,774
Well, for example.
I don't like his expression.

699
00:55:54,000 --> 00:55:55,275
I catch on!

700
00:56:00,776 --> 00:56:04,376
Oh, baby. This is the perfect house
for obeying impulses.

701
00:56:04,377 --> 00:56:07,377
I have work here that'll take me days!

702
00:56:13,378 --> 00:56:14,678
Oh...

703
00:56:31,779 --> 00:56:33,300
Oh, Gerry...

704
00:56:40,101 --> 00:56:42,401
Now I've got another impulse.
You get out of here.

705
00:56:42,402 --> 00:56:44,802
Come on, out you go!
No.

706
00:56:44,803 --> 00:56:46,893
Oh, yes, go...
No...

707
00:56:46,894 --> 00:56:49,100
What will they think downstairs?

708
00:56:49,101 --> 00:56:50,895
I don't care what they think.

709
00:56:51,799 --> 00:56:53,696
I have a bigger impulse.

710
00:56:53,697 --> 00:56:55,297
I want to stay.

711
00:56:56,598 --> 00:56:59,198
I haven't laughed like this in years, Gerry.

712
00:57:00,799 --> 00:57:02,699
I always did have a good time with you.

713
00:57:03,800 --> 00:57:05,400
Why talk about that?

714
00:57:07,501 --> 00:57:11,999
I'm just beginning to realize what a fool
I was to let you get away from me.

715
00:57:12,700 --> 00:57:14,900
Are you trying to make love to me?

716
00:57:15,901 --> 00:57:17,701
That's the impulse.

717
00:57:22,402 --> 00:57:24,002
What about Joan?

718
00:57:25,703 --> 00:57:27,900
Joan will never be a Gerry.

719
00:57:28,501 --> 00:57:32,701
I think the only reason I ever fell for Joan in the first place
was because she reminded me so much of you.

720
00:57:34,702 --> 00:57:36,402
Can't we start all over again?

721
00:57:40,703 --> 00:57:42,000
You mean it?

722
00:57:43,201 --> 00:57:45,401
I was never more serious in my life.

723
00:57:51,002 --> 00:57:53,500
Oh, Gerry...
Just a moment. Let me think.

724
00:57:58,001 --> 00:58:02,400
I'd hate to hurt Joan any more than is necessary.

725
00:58:02,401 --> 00:58:05,201
Joan's just a kid. She'll get over it.

726
00:58:10,002 --> 00:58:12,300
I bet I know what you're thinking about.

727
00:58:13,000 --> 00:58:15,601
Blake. Oh, forget him.

728
00:58:17,402 --> 00:58:18,702
Don't you want me back?

729
00:58:20,603 --> 00:58:23,503
Isn't there a little spark still burning?

730
00:58:24,604 --> 00:58:29,500
Why do you suppose I was so anxious to break it up
between you and Joan?

731
00:58:32,601 --> 00:58:34,101
Jealousy!

732
00:58:36,102 --> 00:58:38,502
What a fool I was not to have seen it before.

733
00:58:40,203 --> 00:58:42,500
You mustn't be too hasty, Jim.

734
00:58:42,501 --> 00:58:43,501
Wait.

735
00:58:44,502 --> 00:58:46,002
Oh, Gerry.

736
00:58:47,803 --> 00:58:51,503
Do you suppose it will work out?
Why, certainly.

737
00:58:52,604 --> 00:58:56,999
Will we ever recapture the happiness of the old times?

738
00:58:57,000 --> 00:58:58,400
We could.

739
00:59:00,600 --> 00:59:03,701
Remember the gay life, the music, the dancing?

740
00:59:06,002 --> 00:59:09,202
Well, the same places are still open.

741
00:59:10,603 --> 00:59:12,203
You used to tell me that you...

742
00:59:12,304 --> 00:59:16,904
liked nothing better than to sit for hours
while I sang to you.

743
00:59:18,505 --> 00:59:20,305
I liked that too.

744
00:59:20,306 --> 00:59:21,706
You did, didn't you?

745
00:59:22,207 --> 00:59:24,107
Do you remember...

746
00:59:24,108 --> 00:59:29,708
If you can hear me calling, dear...

747
00:59:29,709 --> 00:59:33,109
Come to me.

748
00:59:33,110 --> 00:59:36,010
Come to me...

749
00:59:36,011 --> 00:59:42,411
My life, my love, my all.

750
00:59:43,112 --> 00:59:48,112
From near or far, wherever you are

751
00:59:48,113 --> 00:59:51,413
Come to me...

752
00:59:51,414 --> 00:59:53,814
Come to me...

753
00:59:53,815 --> 00:59:59,815
in answer to my call.

754
01:00:01,716 --> 01:00:05,616
Somewhere on a hill

755
01:00:05,617 --> 01:00:09,817
there's a whippoorwill

756
01:00:09,818 --> 01:00:17,718
calling with me as the shadows fall.

757
01:00:19,019 --> 01:00:24,719
I need you now so keep your vow

758
01:00:25,320 --> 01:00:28,720
Come to me.

759
01:00:29,421 --> 01:00:33,221
Come to me...

760
01:00:33,922 --> 01:00:36,722
My life

761
01:00:36,000 --> 01:00:40,223
My love

762
01:00:40,824 --> 01:00:47,224
My all.

763
01:00:56,025 --> 01:00:57,625
So that's it.

764
01:01:00,526 --> 01:01:01,426
Oh...

765
01:01:01,927 --> 01:01:04,327
Oh, Joan's here.

766
01:01:07,928 --> 01:01:10,028
Now... now, Joan...

767
01:01:10,329 --> 01:01:12,029
don't make a scene.

768
01:01:12,030 --> 01:01:15,030
That's right, now, Joan.
You mustn't make a scene.

769
01:01:15,631 --> 01:01:17,831
What am I supposed to do? Applaud?

770
01:01:17,832 --> 01:01:20,532
We were just um...

771
01:01:20,533 --> 01:01:22,333
We were just um...

772
01:01:22,334 --> 01:01:23,334
um.. um...

773
01:01:23,335 --> 01:01:24,835
we were just discussing things.

774
01:01:24,836 --> 01:01:28,736
That's right, Jim was trying to tell me
how much he loves you.

775
01:01:28,737 --> 01:01:31,537
Well?
Well, um...

776
01:01:31,538 --> 01:01:36,338
I think you'd sound more convincing
with your coat on.

777
01:01:39,539 --> 01:01:41,639
No wonder you didn't want me to have him.

778
01:01:41,640 --> 01:01:43,340
You wanted him for yourself.

779
01:01:43,341 --> 01:01:46,841
Why, men like Jim have enough love
for both of us.

780
01:01:48,142 --> 01:01:50,242
I won't share his love with anyone.

781
01:01:52,143 --> 01:01:55,343
Well, I guess you're going to have to choose between.

782
01:01:55,344 --> 01:01:57,044
Pick yourself a Trent.

783
01:01:59,145 --> 01:02:00,300
Wait, maybe this will help.

784
01:02:00,301 --> 01:02:02,601
Ippety-bippety-bippety-tap
Ippety-bippety-bippety

785
01:02:02,602 --> 01:02:04,202
Kannaba.
Kannaba.

786
01:02:04,203 --> 01:02:06,803
Kannaba in, Kannaba out...
How does it go?

787
01:02:07,604 --> 01:02:08,804
Oh, stop it!

788
01:02:10,405 --> 01:02:13,105
Why do you hesitate? Is there any doubt?

789
01:02:13,106 --> 01:02:14,806
Of course there's a doubt.

790
01:02:14,807 --> 01:02:19,607
Jim's very fond of his Gerry,
aren't you, Jim?

791
01:02:19,608 --> 01:02:23,008
Gerry, I don't know how you could do this to me.

792
01:02:27,209 --> 01:02:29,209
Joan, don't cry.

793
01:02:29,210 --> 01:02:31,110
Please.

794
01:02:31,111 --> 01:02:33,011
I know it hurts.

795
01:02:33,412 --> 01:02:36,112
But you'll soon forget. Really you will.

796
01:02:36,813 --> 01:02:38,213
There now, don't cry.

797
01:02:38,214 --> 01:02:40,314
Leave me alone. Don't touch me.

798
01:02:43,515 --> 01:02:44,715
Oh, Joan, I...

799
01:02:45,916 --> 01:02:48,016
I don't think you quite understand.

800
01:02:48,917 --> 01:02:51,417
You see, well...

801
01:02:51,418 --> 01:02:54,118
Jerry and I were once sweethearts.

802
01:03:09,519 --> 01:03:11,119
You and Gerry?

803
01:03:11,120 --> 01:03:13,020
Yes, Joan, and...

804
01:03:13,621 --> 01:03:17,121
Well, we just discovered each other...

805
01:03:17,802 --> 01:03:19,022
all over again.

806
01:03:20,023 --> 01:03:21,223
Haven't we, dear?

807
01:03:44,024 --> 01:03:46,824
Please, Tony, wait!
Tony!

808
01:03:47,625 --> 01:03:49,825
Wait. Don't misunderstand me.

809
01:03:49,826 --> 01:03:51,626
Take your hands off me.
It doesn't mean anything.

810
01:03:51,627 --> 01:03:54,327
He doesn't mean anything!
I don't care why you did it.

811
01:03:54,328 --> 01:03:55,728
Oh, but, Tony...
So that's the man.

812
01:03:55,729 --> 01:03:57,729
And you promised me.
I know I promised you.

813
01:03:57,730 --> 01:04:00,830
But you of all people should understand.
Why, even in your book you said...

814
01:04:00,831 --> 01:04:02,831
But I don't happen to be a character in a book.

815
01:04:15,032 --> 01:04:16,432
How did he take it, darling?

816
01:04:16,433 --> 01:04:17,933
How about it?

817
01:04:21,234 --> 01:04:22,234
Oh...

818
01:04:26,235 --> 01:04:29,005
I'm beginning to understand you, Jim.

819
01:04:29,906 --> 01:04:31,406
You're not bad.

820
01:04:32,000 --> 01:04:35,407
You're just not very bright.

821
01:05:04,808 --> 01:05:06,400
Hello, Gerry.

822
01:05:17,301 --> 01:05:18,701
What's the matter? Sick?

823
01:05:18,702 --> 01:05:20,500
No, I'm alright.

824
01:05:22,501 --> 01:05:24,401
I talked to Joan this morning on the phone.

825
01:05:24,402 --> 01:05:26,002
And what do you think?

826
01:05:28,003 --> 01:05:29,603
She called me.

827
01:05:33,004 --> 01:05:35,204
Looks like everything's gonna be alright.

828
01:05:39,505 --> 01:05:41,705
Say, what happened out there the other night?

829
01:05:41,706 --> 01:05:44,206
Tony no more than got there and he left.

830
01:05:45,307 --> 01:05:46,707
And then you left.

831
01:05:46,708 --> 01:05:48,408
Then everybody left.

832
01:05:48,409 --> 01:05:49,709
So I left.

833
01:05:57,000 --> 01:05:58,210
Howdy, Joan.

834
01:06:06,311 --> 01:06:10,900
Buster, do you mind if I meet you
down at the car?

835
01:06:10,901 --> 01:06:12,801
I want to talk to Gerry.

836
01:06:13,702 --> 01:06:15,102
Sure.

837
01:06:15,103 --> 01:06:16,503
See you soon, Gerry.

838
01:06:24,604 --> 01:06:26,704
I want to tell you, Gerry...

839
01:06:26,705 --> 01:06:29,105
I understand everything now.

840
01:06:31,206 --> 01:06:33,506
I'm sorry about Tony.

841
01:06:33,507 --> 01:06:35,507
I know you are.

842
01:06:38,208 --> 01:06:41,508
And I want to tell you that...

843
01:06:56,000 --> 01:06:58,209
Do you want me to stay home with you?

844
01:07:00,010 --> 01:07:02,210
I don't have to go out with Buster.

845
01:07:02,211 --> 01:07:04,211
I think it would be nice if you would.

846
01:07:05,312 --> 01:07:07,012
You'll be alright?

847
01:07:12,113 --> 01:07:13,513
I'll be home early.

848
01:07:21,014 --> 01:07:25,114
Oh, Miss Trent.
I want you to see something wonderful.

849
01:07:25,115 --> 01:07:26,715
It's just come.

850
01:07:36,016 --> 01:07:38,716
Is this not beautiful?

851
01:08:10,317 --> 01:08:13,617
Are you going to stand around all day
and admire that atrocity?

852
01:08:13,618 --> 01:08:16,618
You should be ashamed of yourself.

853
01:08:16,619 --> 01:08:18,619
I'm getting sick and tired of it.

854
01:08:18,620 --> 01:08:22,220
Why, Aunt Kate, what do you mean?
Here you are in love with a man.

855
01:08:22,221 --> 01:08:25,621
Yet you sit around all day moping
while he sails right out of your life.

856
01:08:25,622 --> 01:08:28,122
Are you sure he's sailing?
Certainly, I called his house.

857
01:08:28,123 --> 01:08:30,223
You didn't.
Of course I did. Why not?

858
01:08:30,224 --> 01:08:32,124
Shame on you!

859
01:08:32,725 --> 01:08:34,600
What did he say?
Nothing.

860
01:08:35,301 --> 01:08:37,101
He wasn't there.

861
01:08:37,102 --> 01:08:39,800
But his servant tells me that he's sailing for Europe.

862
01:08:40,501 --> 01:08:43,101
We were going together. Now he's gone.

863
01:08:43,102 --> 01:08:47,102
No he hasn't.
He doesn't sail for thirty-five minutes.

864
01:08:47,703 --> 01:08:52,303
Now, if you're any sort of a girl at all,
and if you're worthy of the name of Trent,

865
01:08:52,304 --> 01:08:54,304
you'll get out of here and go after him.

866
01:08:57,205 --> 01:08:58,505
Seize your man, isn't it?

867
01:08:58,906 --> 01:09:00,306
You love him, don't you?

868
01:09:00,607 --> 01:09:05,207
Well, you're always preaching to me
about obeying those instincts.

869
01:09:05,208 --> 01:09:07,308
Why don't you practice what you preach?

870
01:09:07,609 --> 01:09:11,209
But I couldn't make the boat in thirty-five minutes.

871
01:09:11,210 --> 01:09:14,000
Besides, I haven't anything packed.
Yes, you have!

872
01:09:14,702 --> 01:09:16,602
Now get out! Come on!

873
01:09:16,603 --> 01:09:18,003
Come on, come on, get out of here.

874
01:09:18,004 --> 01:09:20,500
Wait, here's your coat.

875
01:09:20,501 --> 01:09:21,701
Don't forget your purse.

876
01:09:21,702 --> 01:09:23,802
Come on, get your things together.

877
01:09:23,803 --> 01:09:26,500
Oh, my, I'm sure there's something you've forgotten.

878
01:09:26,501 --> 01:09:29,851
Aunt Kate, my nightgowns, did you pack them?
Goodness, of course.

879
01:09:29,852 --> 01:09:33,452
Here, here, get your coat on.
We haven't any time to lose.

880
01:09:33,453 --> 01:09:36,600
Oh, dear...
I'm not the one that's going!

881
01:09:36,601 --> 01:09:38,001
Here, wear this yourself.

882
01:09:38,002 --> 01:09:40,402
Oh, hurry, hurry...

883
01:09:40,403 --> 01:09:42,303
Now, have you got everything?
Yes...

884
01:09:42,304 --> 01:09:45,954
Aunt Kate, tell Joan about it,
She'll love to know.

885
01:09:45,955 --> 01:09:47,600
I'll tell her.
What is this for?

886
01:09:47,601 --> 01:09:49,300
Oh, I don't know.

887
01:09:49,301 --> 01:09:50,701
Now, have you got your grip?

888
01:09:52,002 --> 01:09:53,602
Hurry now.

889
01:09:56,000 --> 01:09:57,403
Seize your man, isn't it?

890
01:09:57,404 --> 01:10:01,104
Oh, Aunt Kate, you're a darling.
What will I ever do without you?

891
01:10:02,005 --> 01:10:05,305
When you get to Paris
and you still can't do without me...

892
01:10:05,306 --> 01:10:06,700
send for me.

893
01:10:06,701 --> 01:10:08,101
Bye!
Goodbye.

894
01:10:32,302 --> 01:10:34,102
Hello, Aunt Kate. Is Gerry here?

895
01:10:34,103 --> 01:10:35,603
She's out.

896
01:10:35,604 --> 01:10:37,004
I must see her at once.

897
01:10:37,005 --> 01:10:39,205
I started to sail without her but I couldn't.

898
01:10:39,206 --> 01:10:41,600
I don't care what's happened. I want her.

899
01:10:41,601 --> 01:10:44,700
I said a lot of things I'm sorry for
and I want to tell her.

900
01:10:44,701 --> 01:10:49,501
I'm mad about her, I'm simply crazy...
That's what I said the first time I saw you.

901
01:10:51,002 --> 01:10:54,300
I guess I'd better tell you.
She's gone to the boat looking for you.

902
01:10:54,301 --> 01:10:56,301
Gone to the boat looking for me?
Yes.

903
01:10:57,000 --> 01:10:58,500
Looking for me?
Yes.

904
01:10:58,999 --> 01:11:01,501
Goodbye.
Oh, hurry!

905
01:11:17,000 --> 01:11:18,200
Have your tickets ready.

906
01:11:18,201 --> 01:11:19,701
Tickets, please.
I haven't a ticket.

907
01:11:19,702 --> 01:11:21,882
You can't get aboard without a ticket.
But I'm sailing on this...

908
01:11:21,883 --> 01:11:23,783
You're not sailing on this boat without a ticket.

909
01:11:23,784 --> 01:11:26,684
But I must sail.
You must not sail unless you have a ticket.

910
01:11:26,685 --> 01:11:28,300
Will you please stand aside.

911
01:11:28,301 --> 01:11:30,101
Show your tickets, please.

912
01:11:30,402 --> 01:11:32,202
Have your tickets ready.

913
01:11:32,803 --> 01:11:34,803
Have your tickets ready, please.

914
01:11:35,504 --> 01:11:37,404
Have your tickets ready.

915
01:11:57,805 --> 01:11:59,205
Have your tickets ready, please.

916
01:12:12,606 --> 01:12:13,706
Have your tickets ready, please.

917
01:12:22,707 --> 01:12:24,507
Have you seen a girl go by here?

918
01:12:25,708 --> 01:12:27,308
Do you think this boat's for men only?

919
01:12:27,309 --> 01:12:29,809
Wait a minute, sir. She... she,,,

920
01:12:29,810 --> 01:12:32,410
She'd come up to about here on you.

921
01:12:32,411 --> 01:12:35,711
What's the idea?
Honestly, she's a cute little thing.

922
01:12:35,712 --> 01:12:37,812
She looks like this.

923
01:12:38,513 --> 01:12:39,713
Have you got a ticket?

924
01:12:45,214 --> 01:12:46,114
Alright.

925
01:12:46,115 --> 01:12:48,200
Next up...
Just a minute! Here!

926
01:12:49,000 --> 01:12:51,801
If you see her, tell her I'm on board.
I'll tell her.

927
01:13:28,002 --> 01:13:30,502
Tony! Tony!

928
01:13:30,803 --> 01:13:33,403
Tony, where are you?

929
01:13:33,404 --> 01:13:36,204
Tony!
Let go, let go!

930
01:13:36,405 --> 01:13:38,700
I had to get on this ship!

931
01:13:39,004 --> 01:13:40,600
I'm perfectly willing to pay my ticket.

932
01:13:40,601 --> 01:13:43,101
Even if you had a ticket
the cabins can't be shared.

933
01:13:43,102 --> 01:13:45,802
Hello, darling.
Hello, how good!

934
01:13:45,803 --> 01:13:49,300
Don't worry, officer.
She can share my cabin.

935
01:13:52,301 --> 01:13:56,201
I'm sorry, sir. But this is a first-class boat.

936
01:13:57,002 --> 01:13:58,600
Well, to save the reputation of the boat...

937
01:13:58,601 --> 01:14:00,200
the captain can marry us.

938
01:14:01,701 --> 01:14:03,401
With the lady's consent, of course.

939
01:14:10,002 --> 01:14:12,802
Tony, Tony, darling!

940
01:14:25,603 --> 01:14:32,803
