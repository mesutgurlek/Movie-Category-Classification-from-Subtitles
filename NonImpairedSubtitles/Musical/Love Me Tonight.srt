1
00:04:47,514 --> 00:04:49,840
Lovely morning song of Paris,

2
00:04:50,189 --> 00:04:51,909
you are much too loud for me.

3
00:04:58,320 --> 00:05:01,240
It's not a sonata by Mozart.
The song of Paris has its faults.

4
00:05:02,072 --> 00:05:05,392
[...]

5
00:05:06,450 --> 00:05:10,130
But at least it's not Viennese waltz.

6
00:05:11,245 --> 00:05:14,765
Seville has its fandango.
Chicago has its trot.

7
00:05:15,207 --> 00:05:18,767
Buenos - there is tango.
Dresden - its gavotte.

8
00:05:19,168 --> 00:05:23,088
No matter [...]
cold, or wet, or dry,

9
00:05:23,546 --> 00:05:27,466
each morning, like a baby,
Paris starts to cry.

10
00:05:32,010 --> 00:05:36,010
It has taxi horns and claxons
to scare the Anglosaxons,

11
00:05:36,472 --> 00:05:38,432
that's the song of Paris.

12
00:05:38,973 --> 00:05:42,533
It has men that send you postcards
much naughtier than most cards,

13
00:05:42,934 --> 00:05:44,854
that's the song of Paris.

14
00:05:45,853 --> 00:05:50,013
The noise is not delicious, but
it makes you so ambitious.

15
00:05:52,316 --> 00:05:56,236
You would sell your wife and daughter,
for just one Latin quarter.

16
00:05:56,694 --> 00:05:58,614
That's the song of Paris.

17
00:06:13,164 --> 00:06:16,884
Bonjour Dubal!
How's my old pal?

18
00:06:17,334 --> 00:06:20,454
Bonjour, Maurice!
How are you?

19
00:06:21,920 --> 00:06:25,640
- How about Friday?
- Friday is my day!

20
00:06:26,507 --> 00:06:29,427
- Oh, what a man!
- How are you?

21
00:06:30,468 --> 00:06:34,388
- How's your bakery?
- I need a beau.

22
00:06:34,846 --> 00:06:38,206
- Where's your husband?
- He needs the dough!

23
00:06:38,807 --> 00:06:42,327
Hello, Mrs. Bendix!
How's your appendix?

24
00:06:42,769 --> 00:06:45,689
And what is more...
How are you?

25
00:06:47,355 --> 00:06:51,075
Bonjour, hello, sir.
How is the grocer?

26
00:06:51,525 --> 00:06:55,045
You owe ten francs,
how are you?

27
00:06:56,111 --> 00:06:59,431
Ah, how's my coy friend?
Some other boyfriend?

28
00:07:00,072 --> 00:07:03,392
- This is my wife!
- How are you?

29
00:07:04,659 --> 00:07:08,579
- How's your grandpa?
- He's back in jail.

30
00:07:09,037 --> 00:07:12,557
- How's your business?
- How can it fail?

31
00:07:12,998 --> 00:07:16,918
Bonjour, Mr. Cohen!
How are things going?

32
00:07:17,376 --> 00:07:19,296
Comment ca va!

33
00:07:19,670 --> 00:07:21,390
How are you?

34
00:07:39,684 --> 00:07:41,204
How are you?

35
00:07:47,815 --> 00:07:49,335
How are <i>you</i>?

36
00:08:05,952 --> 00:08:08,872
Emile! Nice day for your wedding!

37
00:08:09,497 --> 00:08:12,137
- Yes... Is my suit ready?
- Certainly!

38
00:08:12,374 --> 00:08:15,734
- I want to pay you today, Maurice.
- No hurry!

39
00:08:16,168 --> 00:08:20,088
No no no. You're just getting started,
and business is bad.

40
00:08:20,546 --> 00:08:22,866
- Look at these!
- All sold?

41
00:08:23,256 --> 00:08:27,176
One is yours. And the rest are
for the Vicomte de Barres.

42
00:08:27,634 --> 00:08:31,154
The best dressed man in France?

43
00:08:31,596 --> 00:08:34,516
I'm making all his clothes now, and he'll
make my repuation. He owes me 40,000 francs.

44
00:08:34,931 --> 00:08:36,451
That's what I call success!

45
00:08:36,808 --> 00:08:39,728
- That's fine. 2,000 francs, right?
- Right.

46
00:08:50,776 --> 00:08:53,056
Oh, it's the across Paris run!

47
00:09:03,285 --> 00:09:06,205
- Monsieur Vicomte!
- Maurice...

48
00:09:08,497 --> 00:09:11,417
Monsieur Vicomte was in the race?

49
00:09:11,832 --> 00:09:15,152
Just temporarily. Maurice, have you
some of my clothes ready?

50
00:09:15,585 --> 00:09:17,505
- Are fifteen suits enough?
- Well lock the door and give me a suit quickly.

51
00:09:17,878 --> 00:09:19,798
- He may come along any minute.
- Who?

52
00:09:20,172 --> 00:09:22,492
- The girl's husband. He came home unexpectedly.

53
00:09:22,882 --> 00:09:25,202
What girl?

54
00:09:25,592 --> 00:09:27,472
She's... uh... well I don't remember.

55
00:09:27,885 --> 00:09:32,005
The husband started running after me,
and I ran, and I found myself in the race.

56
00:09:33,306 --> 00:09:36,226
I presume Monsieur Vicomte has no more
need of this.

57
00:09:36,642 --> 00:09:38,562
No no, I got it off a fruit stand.

58
00:09:39,560 --> 00:09:43,480
Emile, would you mind giving the room
to Monsieur Vicomte, please?

59
00:09:43,938 --> 00:09:45,858
Yes, yes, with pleasure.

60
00:09:48,108 --> 00:09:50,628
Thank you, thank you, Maurice.
Thank you.

61
00:09:53,112 --> 00:09:55,032
Hey hey. Go right in there.

62
00:09:58,115 --> 00:10:01,235
Monsieur Vicomte...
About the bill...

63
00:10:05,829 --> 00:10:08,149
About the bill,
Monsieur Vicomte...

64
00:10:08,539 --> 00:10:11,459
The pants are a very good fit, Maurice.

65
00:10:11,875 --> 00:10:13,795
Thank you... Monsieur Vicomte, about the bill.

66
00:10:14,168 --> 00:10:16,088
Tonight I will go to my family Chateau

67
00:10:16,461 --> 00:10:19,381
and get my uncle the Duke to hand over
my next allowance.

68
00:10:19,797 --> 00:10:22,317
Thank you, Monsieur Vicomte.
What about my friend,

69
00:10:22,716 --> 00:10:25,636
the shirtmaker, who's making the new
shirts for you?

70
00:10:26,052 --> 00:10:27,972
- Get his bill too.
- Thank you.

71
00:10:28,345 --> 00:10:31,665
What about my friends, the hatter and the bootmaker?

72
00:10:32,098 --> 00:10:34,018
I'll pay them all at once.
A clean sweep, Maurice.

73
00:10:34,391 --> 00:10:36,311
Thank you, Monsieur Vicomte.

74
00:10:37,101 --> 00:10:39,821
Very nice, very nice.
And now, Maurice...

75
00:10:40,437 --> 00:10:44,357
Do you suppose you can let me have
a little something?

76
00:10:44,815 --> 00:10:46,735
- Money?
- Yes, yes...

77
00:10:47,108 --> 00:10:50,428
You see I'm running around
without my wallet.

78
00:10:50,861 --> 00:10:54,381
- A thousand francs?
- No no, that's too much. Now if you said 500...

79
00:10:54,822 --> 00:10:58,142
- Oh, Monsieur Vicomte, take the thousand.
- No no no...

80
00:10:58,575 --> 00:11:00,495
But Monsieur Vicomte, you need it.

81
00:11:00,868 --> 00:11:03,628
Well I'll tell you. You let me have the 2,000
and we'll say no more about it.

82
00:11:06,288 --> 00:11:10,528
Tomorrow, Maurice, I'll be here
with bags of gold for you! Bags of gold!

83
00:11:10,875 --> 00:11:13,555
A thousand thanks, Monsieur Vicomte.

84
00:11:24,676 --> 00:11:26,956
Maurice, it's beautiful!

85
00:11:27,345 --> 00:11:31,265
Just think, with a little cloth
you make a work of art.

86
00:11:31,723 --> 00:11:34,643
Art for your sweetheart.

87
00:11:35,059 --> 00:11:38,979
It's like poetry in a book...
How beautiful I look.

88
00:11:39,437 --> 00:11:43,757
[...] united with a thread.
Romance of the scissors...

89
00:11:44,232 --> 00:11:47,152
So Claire and I can wed!
Maurice!

90
00:11:48,818 --> 00:11:50,978
- Emile, Emile...
- Oh, you're a magician.

91
00:11:51,237 --> 00:11:52,837
Isn't it romantic?

92
00:11:53,614 --> 00:11:57,134
My face is glowing,
I'm energetic.

93
00:11:57,575 --> 00:12:01,095
The art of sewing,
I find poetic.

94
00:12:01,536 --> 00:12:04,456
My needle punctuates
the rhythm of romance.

95
00:12:04,872 --> 00:12:08,792
I don't give a stitch,
if I don't get rich.

96
00:12:09,250 --> 00:12:13,170
A costume tailor,
who has no custom.

97
00:12:13,628 --> 00:12:15,548
Is like a sailor,
no one will trust him.

98
00:12:15,921 --> 00:12:19,841
But there is magic in the music of my shears,
I shed no tears.

99
00:12:20,299 --> 00:12:21,819
Lend me your ears...

100
00:12:22,175 --> 00:12:24,095
Isn't it romantic?

101
00:12:25,052 --> 00:12:28,812
Soon I will have found some girl
that I adore...

102
00:12:29,222 --> 00:12:31,182
Isn't it romantic?

103
00:12:31,557 --> 00:12:35,477
While I sit around,
my love can scrub the floor.

104
00:12:36,310 --> 00:12:38,470
She'll kiss me every hour...

105
00:12:39,646 --> 00:12:42,006
Or she'll get the sack!

106
00:12:43,024 --> 00:12:45,144
And when I take a shower,

107
00:12:45,942 --> 00:12:48,262
she can scrub my back.

108
00:12:49,069 --> 00:12:50,789
Isn't it romantic?

109
00:12:51,154 --> 00:12:55,074
On a moonlight night,
she'll cook me onion soup.

110
00:12:55,532 --> 00:12:57,652
Kiddies are romantic...

111
00:12:57,992 --> 00:13:01,752
And if we don't fight,
we soon will have a troop!

112
00:13:02,412 --> 00:13:04,932
We'll help the population,

113
00:13:05,539 --> 00:13:08,859
It's a duty that we owe to France!

114
00:13:10,751 --> 00:13:12,671
Isn't it romance?

115
00:13:14,713 --> 00:13:16,633
Isn't it romantic...

116
00:13:18,632 --> 00:13:22,592
A very catchy strain.
Isn't it romantic?

117
00:13:25,303 --> 00:13:27,263
Oh, I forgot my cane.

118
00:13:29,515 --> 00:13:31,235
Thank you very much.

119
00:13:31,558 --> 00:13:33,718
I'd better fix your tie.

120
00:13:38,271 --> 00:13:39,631
Goodbye.

121
00:13:39,814 --> 00:13:41,774
Isn't it romantic?

122
00:13:42,858 --> 00:13:44,578
Taxi?

123
00:13:44,942 --> 00:13:48,062
Oh no, I need some air.
Isn't it romantic?

124
00:13:49,737 --> 00:13:51,657
At last I've got a fare!

125
00:13:52,865 --> 00:13:55,185
Railroad station!

126
00:13:56,200 --> 00:13:59,120
Not too fast,
I hate to take a chance.

127
00:14:01,412 --> 00:14:03,332
Isn't it romance?

128
00:14:04,915 --> 00:14:06,875
Isn't it romantic...

129
00:14:07,875 --> 00:14:09,995
to drive around the town?

130
00:14:10,335 --> 00:14:12,295
Isn't it romantic?

131
00:14:14,505 --> 00:14:16,665
I think I'll take that down...

132
00:14:22,844 --> 00:14:25,804
A B A G F E D C

133
00:14:26,180 --> 00:14:27,940
C A B-flat...

134
00:14:28,682 --> 00:14:30,442
Isn't it romantic?

135
00:14:32,226 --> 00:14:34,586
I'll write some words as well.

136
00:14:34,936 --> 00:14:36,896
Isn't it romantic?

137
00:14:37,229 --> 00:14:41,189
Sitting in the train...
The song has got to sell.

138
00:14:49,947 --> 00:14:51,907
Isn't it romance?

139
00:16:06,251 --> 00:16:08,411
Isn't it romantic,

140
00:16:10,212 --> 00:16:12,572
music in the night,

141
00:16:12,922 --> 00:16:15,082
a dream that can be heard.

142
00:16:16,258 --> 00:16:18,218
Isn't it romantic...

143
00:16:19,802 --> 00:16:23,762
that a hero might appear
and say the word...

144
00:16:26,056 --> 00:16:30,216
[...] a secret charm,
or by my heart's command.

145
00:16:38,774 --> 00:16:42,134
My prince will ride
in armor

146
00:16:43,360 --> 00:16:45,720
just to kiss my hand.

147
00:16:47,738 --> 00:16:49,698
Isn't it romantic...

148
00:16:51,908 --> 00:16:55,868
He will hear my call and [...]

149
00:16:58,788 --> 00:17:00,748
Isn't it romantic?

150
00:17:05,876 --> 00:17:08,836
He'll be strong and tall
and yet [...]

151
00:17:12,131 --> 00:17:15,091
Lover of my fancy...

152
00:17:18,385 --> 00:17:21,345
[...]

153
00:17:26,724 --> 00:17:29,684
Isn't it romance?

154
00:17:35,481 --> 00:17:37,441
Princess! Jeanette!

155
00:17:38,191 --> 00:17:40,551
Count, I'm going to bed!

156
00:17:40,901 --> 00:17:43,861
- I've just come up to join you.
- Join me?

157
00:17:44,237 --> 00:17:46,797
- Join you in a little chat before dinner.
- Not tonight.

158
00:17:47,155 --> 00:17:50,115
I've had another fainting spell and my uncle,
the Duke, thought bed was the best place for me.

159
00:17:50,491 --> 00:17:53,251
I always think that [...]

160
00:17:53,827 --> 00:17:57,187
- Count, why the ladder?
- Oh, it's more romantic.

161
00:17:57,788 --> 00:17:59,348
Careful!

162
00:18:00,498 --> 00:18:02,858
I've brought along my flute,
hoping to entertain.

163
00:18:03,209 --> 00:18:06,169
No, count.
Not tonight.

164
00:18:08,421 --> 00:18:12,381
Oh, before I go. Remember what I said
to you down by the horse trough?

165
00:18:12,799 --> 00:18:16,959
- Quite well.
- What was it? I simply wish to see if it made any impression.

166
00:18:17,385 --> 00:18:20,945
You said "I love you".
Made no impression whatever.

167
00:18:21,346 --> 00:18:23,906
There's probably no use of repeating
the sentiment at this time.

168
00:18:24,265 --> 00:18:26,025
None at all.

169
00:18:27,601 --> 00:18:31,761
Oh, Princess, I trust you don't find
my wooing too ardent.

170
00:18:32,396 --> 00:18:35,556
I was just admiring your restraint.
Good night, Count.

171
00:18:35,940 --> 00:18:38,300
On with the dreams, Princess.

172
00:18:42,820 --> 00:18:46,780
- I'll never be able to use it again!
- Oh, Count, did you break your leg?

173
00:18:47,198 --> 00:18:51,158
No, I fell flat on my flute!

174
00:19:16,594 --> 00:19:20,554
- [...]
- But not too long.

175
00:19:20,972 --> 00:19:24,332
Oh, may it help our niece
grow strong.

176
00:19:24,725 --> 00:19:27,885
Plants from the woods
and birds from the dales

177
00:19:28,269 --> 00:19:31,469
are certain cures for
fainting spells.

178
00:19:31,855 --> 00:19:35,215
- [...]
- May morning bring her health again.

179
00:20:08,339 --> 00:20:10,099
¿Qué quieres?

180
00:20:10,424 --> 00:20:14,384
My dear Duke, you can get rid of me
for 20 thousand francs.

181
00:20:14,802 --> 00:20:17,162
My dear Countess, I...

182
00:20:17,512 --> 00:20:21,472
Uncle, don't be so pompous. I'm only asking for
the money you're holding in trust for me.

183
00:20:21,890 --> 00:20:25,850
If I gave you any, you'd go straight back to Paris.
You're staying here, Valentine.

184
00:20:26,477 --> 00:20:29,837
What you need is more of the simple life, young woman.

185
00:20:30,438 --> 00:20:33,598
The new footmen, Your Grace.

186
00:20:35,441 --> 00:20:37,801
- Uncle...
- No!

187
00:20:47,325 --> 00:20:50,685
Can't we ever get a footman
under forty in this place?

188
00:20:51,077 --> 00:20:53,637
Valentine!

189
00:20:56,081 --> 00:20:59,041
About the schedule for tomorrow,
Your Grace...

190
00:20:59,417 --> 00:21:00,777
Tomorrow?...

191
00:21:01,084 --> 00:21:04,444
Bridge! At three...
And dinner. At eight.

192
00:21:06,296 --> 00:21:09,656
And after dinner...
Bridge!

193
00:21:10,049 --> 00:21:13,209
- Rather an amusing day, Flammand?
- Quite exciting, Your Grace.

194
00:21:13,593 --> 00:21:16,553
- And what are the guests doing now, Flammand?
- Playing bridge, Your Grace.

195
00:21:16,929 --> 00:21:19,089

196
00:21:50,328 --> 00:21:53,288
You wait. I'm going right back to Paris.

197
00:22:13,886 --> 00:22:15,446
A man!

198
00:22:16,805 --> 00:22:19,165
Oh no... Just cousin Gilbert.

199
00:22:20,140 --> 00:22:22,100
What are you doing?

200
00:22:22,434 --> 00:22:25,394
Trying to get up enough energy to go to bed.
What are you doing in this dull hole?

201
00:22:25,769 --> 00:22:28,729
I'm just passing through. I got a taxi
to take me back to Paris.

202
00:22:29,105 --> 00:22:33,465
- Take me with you!
- That's not a bad idea. How much money can you loan me?

203
00:22:33,900 --> 00:22:37,060
I'm over my allowance and Uncle
won't let me have any money.

204
00:22:37,444 --> 00:22:40,404
Oh, you don't know how to handle
the old skyhawk.

205
00:22:40,780 --> 00:22:44,700
I'll tell him I need the money for charity.
To provide good homes for bad stenographers.

206
00:22:44,991 --> 00:22:47,271
Flammand! Send that taxi away!

207
00:22:47,660 --> 00:22:50,020
Uncle, now look, I've got to go back to Paris.

208
00:22:50,370 --> 00:22:52,330
You can't. You're staying here permanently.

209
00:22:52,663 --> 00:22:56,423
And if I hear any more about your debts, about bills,
I'll cut you off without a sou.

210
00:22:56,833 --> 00:22:59,193
You understand? You imp... imp...

211
00:22:59,543 --> 00:23:02,103
- What's the word?
- Impecunious.

212
00:23:02,462 --> 00:23:04,622
- Impudent?
- No.

213
00:23:04,964 --> 00:23:07,284
- Impostor!
- No!

214
00:23:07,674 --> 00:23:09,634
- Impertinent!
- Ah, that's it!

215
00:23:09,967 --> 00:23:12,487
- You impertinent jack... jack...
- Jackal?

216
00:23:12,886 --> 00:23:15,246
- No no no...
- Well I'm sorry.

217
00:23:15,596 --> 00:23:17,556
- Jackass?
- I wish you'd go to bed.

218
00:23:17,890 --> 00:23:19,410
Jackanapes!

219
00:23:19,766 --> 00:23:22,686
- Liar! Cheat!
- You'll be insulting me in a minute.

220
00:23:23,102 --> 00:23:27,062
Nitwit! Numbskull! Nincompoop!

221
00:23:27,897 --> 00:23:31,817
Lord, grant her rest be sweet and deep.

222
00:23:32,275 --> 00:23:35,235
And knights go riding through her sleep!

223
00:23:35,548 --> 00:23:39,528
Her own Prince Charming, young and bold.

224
00:23:39,989 --> 00:23:41,949
Who came to Princesses of old.

225
00:23:42,282 --> 00:23:46,242
- Never to us...
- Never to us...

226
00:23:48,328 --> 00:23:50,288
Stir slowly...

227
00:23:50,621 --> 00:23:53,781
Slowly...
And may it [...]

228
00:24:40,657 --> 00:24:43,617
- I want the money for my shirts!
- And my shoes! And my hats!

229
00:24:43,992 --> 00:24:47,912
You introduced him to us,
you said his trade will bring other business.

230
00:24:48,370 --> 00:24:51,690
It will! We must be careful not to insult
the Vicomte de Barres.

231
00:24:52,123 --> 00:24:56,163
- He comes from the old nobility, quick to take offense.
- And slow to pay!

232
00:24:56,710 --> 00:24:59,030
- Maurice Courtelain?
- Yes.

233
00:25:00,879 --> 00:25:03,799
I understand you made a lot of clothes
for the Vicomte de Barres...

234
00:25:04,215 --> 00:25:08,175
Ah, you see, Monsieur, that I made a lot of clothes
for the Vicomte. If Monsieur will take a chair...

235
00:25:08,593 --> 00:25:12,513
I'll show him samples.
Monsieur is a friend of the Vicomte?

236
00:25:12,971 --> 00:25:15,291
Not at all. Do you know who I am?

237
00:25:15,681 --> 00:25:19,601
Oh... now I understand.

238
00:25:20,059 --> 00:25:23,979
Monsieur, why don't you try to forgive and forget?
This is Paris, city of romance, love.

239
00:25:24,438 --> 00:25:28,358
Please, forgive the Vicomte and forgive also your wife.

240
00:25:28,816 --> 00:25:32,736
I have no wife!
What is all this?

241
00:25:33,194 --> 00:25:36,514
You are not the man who chased the Vicomte
in his BVDs?

242
00:25:36,946 --> 00:25:39,866
Certainly not! I am the credit manager of the
Association of Retail Merchants!

243
00:25:40,282 --> 00:25:43,602
I came here to tell you,
that not a tailor in Paris

244
00:25:44,035 --> 00:25:46,955
will make that fellow a suit
without full payment. In advance!

245
00:25:47,370 --> 00:25:49,290
You... you... you mean...

246
00:25:49,664 --> 00:25:53,584
I mean, the Vicomte de Barres
never pays.

247
00:25:54,876 --> 00:25:57,796
The Vicomte... Never pays...

248
00:25:58,211 --> 00:26:01,531
- My shirts! - My hats!
- My boots! - My suits...

249
00:26:01,964 --> 00:26:04,684
Gentlemen,
you have my profound sympathy.

250
00:26:09,261 --> 00:26:11,581
The old nobility, eh?

251
00:26:11,971 --> 00:26:15,891
Do you know what I'd like to do?
I'd like to have a crowd

252
00:26:16,349 --> 00:26:18,469
march down there and attack that chateau!

253
00:26:18,851 --> 00:26:22,171
- Wait! That's an idea...
- You think we could?

254
00:26:22,604 --> 00:26:26,524
Just like in the old days?
What about the police?

255
00:26:26,982 --> 00:26:29,902
I don't mean attack it in a crowd.
Let me attack it - alone!

256
00:26:30,317 --> 00:26:33,237
I'll be a one-man French Revolution.

257
00:26:33,653 --> 00:26:36,973
Let me have all the goods the Vicomte ordered.

258
00:26:37,406 --> 00:26:40,726
I'll deliver them to the chateau!
And I'll make him pay!

259
00:26:50,123 --> 00:26:52,843
Maurice!
I just heard you were going.

260
00:26:53,480 --> 00:26:55,180
Let me husband drive you.
[...]

261
00:26:55,544 --> 00:26:59,304
and he'd love to drop you.
Pierre, tell Maurice you'd love to drop him.

262
00:26:59,630 --> 00:27:01,630
I'd love to drop you.
Get in!

263
00:27:02,007 --> 00:27:04,927
Oh, that's fine. Over here!
Thank you.

264
00:27:05,342 --> 00:27:08,262
Just like a millionaire.

265
00:27:08,678 --> 00:27:10,998

266
00:27:11,388 --> 00:27:13,208

267
00:27:13,912 --> 00:27:16,512
Oh no, look at that.
I'm not going to drink that.

268
00:27:17,017 --> 00:27:19,137

269
00:27:19,749 --> 00:27:21,249
My hat!
My hat!

270
00:27:21,604 --> 00:27:22,924
Thank you! Thank you!

271
00:27:23,272 --> 00:27:25,792
Careful, not too fast.

272
00:27:26,190 --> 00:27:28,110

273
00:27:28,484 --> 00:27:30,404

274
00:27:30,777 --> 00:27:33,297

275
00:27:47,038 --> 00:27:49,358
Lover,
when you find me

276
00:27:51,834 --> 00:27:54,914
will you blind me
with your love?

277
00:28:03,925 --> 00:28:05,645
Kiss me... I'll be sighing.

278
00:28:07,887 --> 00:28:10,807
Gently praying, I'll obey.

279
00:28:13,516 --> 00:28:16,636
children playing in the... hey!

280
00:28:21,877 --> 00:28:24,077
He'll be my lord and my master...

281
00:28:25,816 --> 00:28:28,536
I'll be [...]

282
00:28:29,777 --> 00:28:32,697
He'll make my heart beat faster...

283
00:28:33,530 --> 00:28:35,850
Not too fast!

284
00:28:38,742 --> 00:28:41,062
Lover,
when you take me...

285
00:28:42,286 --> 00:28:45,206
and awake me...
I will know.

286
00:28:48,540 --> 00:28:51,980
Lover, you can make me
love you so.

287
00:28:52,918 --> 00:28:55,238
Look out, Mademoiselle!
Look out!

288
00:28:57,713 --> 00:29:02,033
Pierre! You take the horse,
I'll take the lady.

289
00:29:03,009 --> 00:29:06,049
- Mademoiselle, are you hurt?
- Oh, no.

290
00:29:07,721 --> 00:29:10,641
- Mademoiselle, put your arms around me.
- No, thank you, I can manage alone.

291
00:29:11,056 --> 00:29:12,776
Oh! My ankle!

292
00:29:13,141 --> 00:29:15,461
[...]
put your arms around.

293
00:29:15,851 --> 00:29:17,571
Do you think I put my arms around
people I don't know?

294
00:29:17,936 --> 00:29:19,856
My name is Maurice.

295
00:29:24,608 --> 00:29:26,928
Oh, that's nothing.

296
00:29:28,777 --> 00:29:31,697
- It's quite unnecessary.
- Don't stand on it yet.

297
00:29:32,113 --> 00:29:35,033
- I'm sure it's better.
- No no no.

298
00:29:36,908 --> 00:29:40,428
- Tell me, do you live down here?
- I often wonder.

299
00:29:40,869 --> 00:29:43,789
No, I said, do you live down here?

300
00:29:44,205 --> 00:29:47,325
I heard you. I wonder if you
can call it living...

301
00:29:47,749 --> 00:29:50,029
Seems so dead.

302
00:29:50,292 --> 00:29:52,172
- I must go.
- Oh no, not right away.

303
00:29:52,544 --> 00:29:55,864
See? One foot wants to go, the other
wants to stay.

304
00:29:56,297 --> 00:30:00,217
They both want to go.
My family is waiting for me.

305
00:30:00,675 --> 00:30:04,595
- But what about me?
- What do you mean, what about you?

306
00:30:05,053 --> 00:30:08,973
I mean I'm stuck here, I can't go. My carriage is in
disrepair and I'm lonely. You can't leave me.

307
00:30:09,639 --> 00:30:11,759
Aren't you a little insane?

308
00:30:12,141 --> 00:30:14,461
Yes! Let me sing for you!

309
00:30:14,851 --> 00:30:16,971
You <i>are</i> insane.

310
00:30:17,353 --> 00:30:19,673
But you sang for me.

311
00:30:20,063 --> 00:30:22,983
I didn't even know you existed.

312
00:30:23,399 --> 00:30:26,319
You don't exist either.
You're a dream.

313
00:30:26,735 --> 00:30:30,855
Oh, give me just a moment.
Just to sing for you, Mimi.

314
00:30:31,031 --> 00:30:33,631
You're mad! And my name is not Mimi.

315
00:30:34,032 --> 00:30:35,952
Yes! I am mad!

316
00:30:36,325 --> 00:30:39,845
My left shoe's on my right foot,
my right shoe's on my left.

317
00:30:40,286 --> 00:30:42,806
Oh listen to me, Mimi.
Of reason I'm bereft.

318
00:30:43,163 --> 00:30:47,123
The buttons of my trousers
are buttoned to my vest.

319
00:30:47,583 --> 00:30:50,503
Listen to me, Mimi.
There's passion in my breast!

320
00:30:52,169 --> 00:30:55,089
Mimi... You funny little good for nothing, Mimi.
Am I the guy?

321
00:30:59,216 --> 00:31:03,176
Mimi, you sunny little honey of a Mimi.
I may be high.

322
00:31:05,762 --> 00:31:09,242
Mimi... you got me sad and dreamy...

323
00:31:09,682 --> 00:31:12,202
You could free me...
If you'd see me...

324
00:31:14,435 --> 00:31:18,795
Mimi... You know I'd like to have a little
[...]

325
00:31:19,897 --> 00:31:23,017
Mimi... You funny little good for nothing, Mimi.
Am I the guy?

326
00:31:26,986 --> 00:31:30,906
Mimi, you sunny little honey of a Mimi.
I may be high.

327
00:31:33,657 --> 00:31:36,177
Mimi, you got me sad and dreamy.

328
00:31:38,869 --> 00:31:42,789
You could free me...
If you'd see me... Mimi...

329
00:31:47,834 --> 00:31:49,154
Thank you.

330
00:31:49,502 --> 00:31:53,422
You think I'm rude? Vulgar?
You know, since you came into my life, I'm not myself.

331
00:31:53,838 --> 00:31:56,198
- Perhaps I'm in love with you!
- Oh really now!

332
00:31:56,548 --> 00:31:58,508
- Afraid? - Of what?
- Of me.

333
00:31:58,842 --> 00:32:01,202
- What conceit...
- Of yourself? - What insolence.

334
00:32:01,552 --> 00:32:03,112
You think it takes years to fall in love?

335
00:32:03,428 --> 00:32:07,188
You're right! I've known you
a hundred years! A thousand years!

336
00:32:07,598 --> 00:32:11,558
- You're impossible.
- I hope to see you again somewhere soon.
- Perhaps in another thousand years!

337
00:32:14,978 --> 00:32:18,858
I'll dream of you every day! Every night!
Everywhere!

338
00:32:19,315 --> 00:32:23,235
I love you! I love you!
I love you!

339
00:32:32,032 --> 00:32:34,552
Your hat! Look at it!

340
00:32:35,493 --> 00:32:39,493
What will you do without your straw hat, Maurice?
And where's that smile of yours?

341
00:32:39,912 --> 00:32:42,072
No straw hat? No smile?

342
00:32:42,414 --> 00:32:45,054
It's all over, Maurice! You can't go on!

343
00:32:55,132 --> 00:32:59,092
- Now we can go on, Pierre. Good old Pierre.
- We can go on if I ever fix this car.

344
00:33:35,785 --> 00:33:39,145
Princess! Help! Help!

345
00:33:43,457 --> 00:33:45,257
Help! Help!

346
00:33:46,626 --> 00:33:50,786
She's fainted again.

347
00:33:51,213 --> 00:33:55,573
You know, I had an elder brother

348
00:33:56,008 --> 00:33:57,568
who used to faint quite often.
He was a nip-omaniac.

349
00:33:57,884 --> 00:33:59,444
A what?

350
00:33:59,761 --> 00:34:03,121
A nip-omaniac.
He used to go around pinching things.

351
00:34:03,513 --> 00:34:06,673
Oh, I had a friend like that.
He used to pinch business girls in elevators.

352
00:34:07,057 --> 00:34:09,017
They had to send him to a cooler climate...

353
00:34:09,351 --> 00:34:13,311
- No... I knew a girl...
- This is no time for reminiscences. Get a couple of footmen to carry her upstairs.

354
00:34:13,729 --> 00:34:17,089
But you gave the servants the afternoon off.
Our footmen are playing football against the Old Soldiers Home.

355
00:34:17,482 --> 00:34:21,682
- You two carry her upstairs! Someone fetch a doctor!
- You carry her, I'll get the doctor.

356
00:34:24,778 --> 00:34:27,738
Valentine, can you go for a doctor?

357
00:34:28,114 --> 00:34:30,074
Certainly. Bring him right in.

358
00:34:30,407 --> 00:34:33,967
No, no, it's for Jeanette.
She's fainted again.

359
00:34:45,418 --> 00:34:48,978
Princess,
permit me to introduce Doctor Armand de Pertignac.

360
00:34:49,379 --> 00:34:51,539
- Your Highness...
- Doctor.

361
00:35:00,220 --> 00:35:02,180
And now my dear,
remove your dress.

362
00:35:02,513 --> 00:35:05,073
- My what?
- Your dress.

363
00:35:05,432 --> 00:35:07,592
There's no occasion for distress.

364
00:35:07,934 --> 00:35:10,894
- Is that necessary?
- Very. Yes.

365
00:35:11,270 --> 00:35:14,230
As long as professional ethics apply,

366
00:35:14,605 --> 00:35:17,565
I'll see you with only a doctor's eye.

367
00:35:27,990 --> 00:35:30,950
The doctor's eye is satisfied.

368
00:35:31,325 --> 00:35:33,685
Now I'll hear your heart.

369
00:35:34,453 --> 00:35:36,413
Don't sigh.

370
00:35:38,289 --> 00:35:42,169
Very good. Nothing wrong here.
Now I'll take your pulse, dear.

371
00:35:44,668 --> 00:35:49,228
Perfectly regular, right on the tick.
Madam, oh Madam, you cannot be sick.

372
00:35:51,131 --> 00:35:54,091
Then why do I lie awake in bed?

373
00:35:54,467 --> 00:35:58,027
- And why does blood rush to my head?
- At night?

374
00:35:58,428 --> 00:36:01,788
Quite right, at night.
And why does music make me sad?

375
00:36:02,181 --> 00:36:05,341
And why do love songs drive me mad?

376
00:36:05,725 --> 00:36:09,085
- At night?
- Quite right, at night.

377
00:36:09,477 --> 00:36:12,037
- And frequently I faint.
- That's quaint.

378
00:36:13,439 --> 00:36:17,399
I feel so pressed
when I'm alone in bed at night...

379
00:36:18,025 --> 00:36:21,585
- How old are you?
- I'm twenty-two.

380
00:36:22,612 --> 00:36:26,772
While other people dance, I feel
so dead at night...

381
00:36:27,198 --> 00:36:31,158
At twenty-two?
Well this won't do.

382
00:36:32,160 --> 00:36:33,760
Are you married?

383
00:36:34,078 --> 00:36:38,038
My husband died 3 years ago.
At 16 I was wed.

384
00:36:38,456 --> 00:36:42,416
- You've been a widow for 3 years?
- 3 years the Prince is dead.

385
00:36:42,834 --> 00:36:46,794
- Were you very happy with your spouse?
- He was a son of noble house.

386
00:36:47,629 --> 00:36:50,989
It was a happiness of great peace.

387
00:36:51,591 --> 00:36:54,751
[...]
My better half.

388
00:36:56,386 --> 00:36:59,786
And here you have his photograph.

389
00:37:08,895 --> 00:37:11,455
How was old your bridge-groom, dear?

390
00:37:11,813 --> 00:37:13,773
- Seveny-two.
- Seventy-two?!

391
00:37:14,107 --> 00:37:16,307
- Seventy-two.
- Well this won't do!

392
00:37:18,276 --> 00:37:21,236
Sweet music makes me cry and pout.

393
00:37:22,654 --> 00:37:25,614
Perhaps I better journey south.

394
00:37:26,824 --> 00:37:30,424
Perhaps my tonsils should come out.

395
00:37:30,827 --> 00:37:33,387
Well it's a very pretty mouth.

396
00:37:34,162 --> 00:37:36,722
I'm wasting away,

397
00:37:37,290 --> 00:37:40,850
for three years I've starved.
Alone, no joy I've tasted.

398
00:37:43,252 --> 00:37:47,692
With eyes, and red lips,
and a figure like that.

399
00:37:48,131 --> 00:37:52,811
You're not wasted away...
You're just wasted!

400
00:37:58,972 --> 00:38:01,932
Well doctor,
we have planned an outing in the forest

401
00:38:02,307 --> 00:38:05,267
but I suppose we better call it off.

402
00:38:05,643 --> 00:38:07,603
No, no; go right ahead.

403
00:38:07,936 --> 00:38:11,896
- Oh! Then Jeanette is not in any danger?
- Well, nothing immediate.

404
00:38:12,940 --> 00:38:15,900
But! The Princess ought to be married.

405
00:38:16,276 --> 00:38:17,636
- Married?
- Married?

406
00:38:17,943 --> 00:38:20,303
To a man of her own age.

407
00:38:20,654 --> 00:38:23,614
Ah, but the only two eligible men in France,

408
00:38:23,989 --> 00:38:28,149
the only two of rank equal to Her Highness,
are not exactly of my niece's age.

409
00:38:28,576 --> 00:38:30,536
How old are they?

410
00:38:30,869 --> 00:38:34,829
One is 85. And the other will
be 12 on his next birthday.

411
00:38:35,664 --> 00:38:39,624
- Well... This <i>is</i> a problem.
- What do you recommend?

412
00:38:40,876 --> 00:38:43,836
Exercise!
Exercise and exercise!

413
00:38:49,632 --> 00:38:51,192
Exercise...

414
00:38:56,512 --> 00:38:58,472
This gives me new hope.

415
00:38:58,806 --> 00:39:01,766
About my chances of marrying Jeanette.

416
00:39:02,141 --> 00:39:06,101
I'll ask her to consider me as a prescription.

417
00:39:06,519 --> 00:39:10,079
My dear Count...
The only obstacle lies in the delicate matter of rank.

418
00:39:10,481 --> 00:39:13,041
Jeanette demands a prince at least.
And you are not a prince.

419
00:39:13,399 --> 00:39:16,759
Well I would've been if our family 	
hadn't been badly gypped

420
00:39:17,152 --> 00:39:19,112
during the crusades.

421
00:39:19,445 --> 00:39:23,405
Anyway, Your Grace mustn't
forget the tenth Count de Sauvignac.

422
00:39:25,283 --> 00:39:29,243
- Marie Antoinette?!
- Positively.

423
00:39:29,661 --> 00:39:33,581
- Now may I ask Jeanette?
- Yes, but not this afternoon.

424
00:39:34,039 --> 00:39:36,239
Quite right. Of course, that's me,
you know, always impetuous.

425
00:41:47,050 --> 00:41:48,810
Monsieur...

426
00:41:49,343 --> 00:41:52,063
Mademoiselle... I'm looking
for the Vicomte de Barres.

427
00:41:53,513 --> 00:41:57,433
- I didn't know he was expecting a friend. Are you alone?
- Alone?

428
00:41:57,891 --> 00:42:01,211
- I mean in life. You're not married?
- Ah, no!

429
00:42:01,643 --> 00:42:03,763
I'll be right down!

430
00:42:06,855 --> 00:42:08,415
Monsieur...

431
00:42:09,774 --> 00:42:11,694
Who made that for you?

432
00:42:12,067 --> 00:42:14,387
McClintock and Armstrong, Monsieur...
Of London.

433
00:42:14,778 --> 00:42:17,698
Might I recommend them for your own service?

434
00:42:18,113 --> 00:42:21,033
Oh no, thank you. I'm looking
for the Vicomte des Barres.

435
00:42:21,449 --> 00:42:24,769
Possibly in the drawing room,
Monsieur.

436
00:42:35,000 --> 00:42:37,520
- Mesdames...
- Monsieur...

437
00:42:38,753 --> 00:42:41,073
- His smile is so disarming!
- So grand!

438
00:42:41,463 --> 00:42:43,383
- So gay!
- So charming!

439
00:42:43,757 --> 00:42:44,677
Mesdames...

440
00:42:45,216 --> 00:42:48,136
We bore you with our sewing?

441
00:42:48,552 --> 00:42:50,512
- Sewing?
- Quite so.

442
00:42:50,845 --> 00:42:53,165
Oh no! A needle is magnetic!

443
00:42:53,555 --> 00:42:56,115
- How true!
- And how poetic!

444
00:42:56,474 --> 00:42:58,594
- Mesdames...
- Monsieur...

445
00:43:15,654 --> 00:43:18,574
Oh no, no. Never use silk on armor.

446
00:43:18,990 --> 00:43:21,310
Flannel is the thing.

447
00:43:21,700 --> 00:43:25,820
- Are you interested in armor?
- Any kind of wearing apparel. Is this your only job?
- Oh no, I putter around.

448
00:43:26,287 --> 00:43:29,207
Tell me, where can I find the Vicomte de Barres?

449
00:43:29,622 --> 00:43:31,542
Oh, he's somewhere about... I hate him!

450
00:43:31,916 --> 00:43:35,236
Imagine - he would like to tear down
this beautiful chateau!

451
00:43:35,668 --> 00:43:38,388
No! It would be better to tear down the Vicomte.

452
00:43:38,796 --> 00:43:41,716
Ah! You're a man after my own heart.
You have a soul.

453
00:43:42,131 --> 00:43:44,051
Someone looking for me?

454
00:43:44,424 --> 00:43:47,344
- Ah, Monsieur Vicomte.
- Maurice...

455
00:43:47,760 --> 00:43:49,680
I came down about those...

456
00:43:50,053 --> 00:43:54,173
My, my, how well you're looking!
You... you've met my uncle...

457
00:43:54,640 --> 00:43:57,160
- Uncle?
- The... the... the Duke.

458
00:43:57,767 --> 00:44:01,287
Oh yes, we had a little chat.
He's the first of your friends

459
00:44:01,728 --> 00:44:04,248
who I didn't want to hit with a battle axe.

460
00:44:04,647 --> 00:44:07,167
He recommended flannel.

461
00:44:07,566 --> 00:44:09,686
Flannel?! Would you pardon us a moment, uncle?

462
00:44:12,048 --> 00:44:14,588
Maurice, did you tell uncle about those bills?

463
00:44:14,946 --> 00:44:16,906
But I didn't get a chance.
And I didn't know he was your uncle.

464
00:44:17,281 --> 00:44:21,001
Now, Vicomte, I brought all your clothes
and I want the money.

465
00:44:21,409 --> 00:44:23,809
See, it's 63,000 francs.

466
00:44:24,161 --> 00:44:27,721
And I'm here also on behalf
of my fellow creditors.

467
00:44:28,164 --> 00:44:30,084
Put yourself in their place.

468
00:44:30,457 --> 00:44:33,177
I'd like to. It isn't anyone who can
be a creditor nowadays.

469
00:44:33,584 --> 00:44:37,504
Now, Maurice, I'm going to be frank with you.
Right now I can't pay you.

470
00:44:37,921 --> 00:44:40,281
Ah, then I'll have to see the Duke.

471
00:44:40,631 --> 00:44:44,791
He'll throw you out. He hates tradesmen.
He'll throw me out too, so what's the use?

472
00:44:45,218 --> 00:44:47,578
I won't leave the chateau without my money.

473
00:44:47,928 --> 00:44:49,888
Oh why do you say...

474
00:44:50,430 --> 00:44:54,390
I've got it! Then stay here.
I'll have the money in a few days, I'll borrow it.

475
00:44:56,059 --> 00:44:59,019
No no no, this is no place for me.
A tailor in a chateau.

476
00:44:59,394 --> 00:45:02,354
- Well why not?
- No no, I'm going to see the Duke.

477
00:45:06,315 --> 00:45:08,235
Oh! The charming young man!

478
00:45:08,567 --> 00:45:11,167
- I'm trying to persuade him to stay.
- I'm sorry, I can't.

479
00:45:11,527 --> 00:45:13,447
Oh there you are.

480
00:45:13,779 --> 00:45:15,739
We've been trying to persuade him to stay...

481
00:45:16,114 --> 00:45:18,034
Of course! You're staying! Jeanette!

482
00:45:19,449 --> 00:45:21,569
Countess, let me present...

483
00:45:22,326 --> 00:45:24,486
Gilbert, present your friend.

484
00:45:25,245 --> 00:45:27,205
Yes yes, of course.

485
00:45:27,538 --> 00:45:29,698
This is my good friend...

486
00:45:30,040 --> 00:45:32,000
Maurice... Baron Courtelain.

487
00:45:33,042 --> 00:45:35,122
Yes, I've met the Baron.

488
00:45:35,461 --> 00:45:37,821
- We're trying to persuade him to stay.
- Are we?

489
00:45:38,379 --> 00:45:40,339
The Baron must've changed.

490
00:45:40,673 --> 00:45:43,073
He used to make very sudden decisions.

491
00:45:47,135 --> 00:45:49,095
I'll stay!

492
00:46:12,028 --> 00:46:13,988
Ha ha! That Baron...!

493
00:46:15,572 --> 00:46:17,532
How did it go...

494
00:46:17,866 --> 00:46:21,026
Mimi... You funny little good for nothing, Mimi.

495
00:46:24,537 --> 00:46:27,697
Mimi... You sunny little honey of a Mimi.
I may be high.

496
00:46:32,876 --> 00:46:35,836
Mimi, you got me sad and dreamy.

497
00:46:36,629 --> 00:46:39,589
You could free me
if you see me.

498
00:46:40,798 --> 00:46:44,358
Mimi, you know I'd like to have a little sun.
Mimi, bye bye.

499
00:46:47,678 --> 00:46:50,038
That Baron, eh?

500
00:46:52,682 --> 00:46:56,442
Mimi... You funny little good for nothing, Mimi.
Am I the guy?

501
00:46:59,562 --> 00:47:01,922
Mimi... You sunny little honey of a Mimi.
I may be high.

502
00:47:07,067 --> 00:47:10,427
Mimi... You got me sad and dreamy

503
00:47:12,279 --> 00:47:15,639
you could free me
if you see me.

504
00:47:17,491 --> 00:47:21,091
Mimi, you know I'd like to have a little sun.
Oh Mimi, bye bye.

505
00:47:21,452 --> 00:47:24,612
Mimi... You funny little good for nothing, Mimi.
Am I the guy?

506
00:47:28,332 --> 00:47:31,892
Mimi... You sunny little honey of a Mimi.
I may be high.

507
00:47:35,003 --> 00:47:37,963
Mimi... You got me sad and dreamy

508
00:47:38,339 --> 00:47:41,299
you could free me
if you see me.

509
00:47:43,551 --> 00:47:46,511
Mimi, you know I'd like to have a little sun.
Oh Mimi, bye bye.

510
00:47:48,972 --> 00:47:52,332
Mimi... You funny little good for nothing, Mimi.
Am I the guy?

511
00:47:56,269 --> 00:48:00,229
Mimi... You sunny little honey of a Mimi.
I may be high.

512
00:48:39,883 --> 00:48:41,843
Hi, Count!

513
00:48:43,427 --> 00:48:46,987
Your Grace, with your permission,
I'd like to do my hunting indoors today.

514
00:48:47,388 --> 00:48:50,348
- Indoors?
- In your library.

515
00:48:50,724 --> 00:48:51,764
What the deuce?!

516
00:48:51,975 --> 00:48:55,335
As much as I love a good gallop,
I'm giving it up in your interest.

517
00:48:55,727 --> 00:48:58,087
Yes, but why all this mystery?

518
00:48:59,271 --> 00:49:03,231
Concerns the Baron. I've never heard of the Courtelains
in all my historical research. Have you?

519
00:49:05,317 --> 00:49:09,077
No, but I'm not as familiar as I might be
with the nobility of the South.

520
00:49:09,487 --> 00:49:13,247
I ran through 8 or 10 volumes before breakfast
and found not a Courtelain.

521
00:49:14,282 --> 00:49:18,242
- Bless my soul.
- Mind you, I still have 36 more volumes to look through before I'm sure.

522
00:49:18,660 --> 00:49:20,620
Yes, but this fellow is a friend of Gilbert's.

523
00:49:20,953 --> 00:49:23,713
Gilbert I need only remind you is none too choosy.

524
00:49:24,081 --> 00:49:27,241
Well, you go right ahead, my boy.

525
00:49:30,961 --> 00:49:34,921
Oh, well, Maurice! You look great!
Is that my new riding habit?

526
00:49:35,547 --> 00:49:38,507
No no, not until you paid for it, Monsieur Vicomte.

527
00:49:38,883 --> 00:49:42,043
I've been up since daybreak altering it to fit me.

528
00:49:43,261 --> 00:49:44,821
Have you picked out something good to ride on?

529
00:49:45,137 --> 00:49:48,297
- The best I could get.
- Is it the big gray one?

530
00:49:48,681 --> 00:49:52,241
- No. Small, orange, with black stripes.
- What is it, a zebra?

531
00:49:52,643 --> 00:49:54,003
No. A bicycle.

532
00:49:55,353 --> 00:49:58,313
You can't use a bicycle in a hunt.
You got to ride a horse.

533
00:49:58,689 --> 00:50:00,649
But I've never been on a horse in my life.

534
00:50:01,399 --> 00:50:04,919
Baron, I want to lend you a horse. Thunderbolt.

535
00:50:05,193 --> 00:50:07,713
- Thunderbolt?
- He's fast, but furious.

536
00:50:08,070 --> 00:50:12,430
I think I'd better not. You see,
the harder the horse, the harder I get.

537
00:50:12,865 --> 00:50:15,825
I might hurt Thunderbolt.

538
00:50:16,201 --> 00:50:17,881
Oh, he can take it.

539
00:50:18,077 --> 00:50:21,037
Oh Baron. I took the liberty of
choosing a horse for you.

540
00:50:21,413 --> 00:50:25,373
That's so kind of you. I won't need
your Thunderbolt. What's my horse's name?

541
00:50:25,791 --> 00:50:28,151
- Solitude.
- Oh... Solitude.

542
00:50:28,501 --> 00:50:30,461
Well. Good hunting.

543
00:50:30,795 --> 00:50:33,635
Solitude sounds just my type.

544
00:50:33,880 --> 00:50:36,280
Do you know why they call him Solitude?

545
00:50:36,632 --> 00:50:38,792
Because he always come home alone.

546
00:50:39,134 --> 00:50:42,694
Solitude for Baron Courtelain!

547
00:50:44,971 --> 00:50:48,931
What's the point in giving the Baron
a horse like that?

548
00:50:49,349 --> 00:50:51,309
I want to test the Baron.

549
00:50:51,643 --> 00:50:53,563
I can think of several better ways to do that.
Let me try.

550
00:50:53,936 --> 00:50:56,856
Don't bother. Tell me, do you ever think of
anything but men, dear?

551
00:50:57,272 --> 00:50:59,232
- Oh, yes. - Like what?
- Schoolboys.

552
00:51:07,362 --> 00:51:09,482
I know that's Solitude.

553
00:51:09,864 --> 00:51:13,824
That's only Thunderbolt.
There's Solitude.

554
00:52:00,941 --> 00:52:03,181
Gilbert! He's not going to...
Oh Gilbert! Don't let him!

555
00:52:08,989 --> 00:52:10,349
Oh, Gilbert!

556
00:54:34,592 --> 00:54:36,512
Stand back! Stand back!

557
00:54:48,977 --> 00:54:51,097
What is this?

558
00:54:52,104 --> 00:54:55,624
This? This is oats, Madame. Very wild.

559
00:54:56,065 --> 00:54:59,385
And this is the stag. Very tired.

560
00:55:00,860 --> 00:55:02,980
And where's Solitude?

561
00:55:03,362 --> 00:55:08,282
We agreed to separate.
He went home. Alone.

562
00:55:10,242 --> 00:55:12,362
And what are your plans?

563
00:55:12,744 --> 00:55:16,664
Oh, very simple, Madame.
After supper, the stag will go right to bed.

564
00:55:17,122 --> 00:55:19,442
He's had a hard day.

565
00:55:19,832 --> 00:55:22,352
And the hunt just stops, I suppose...

566
00:55:22,751 --> 00:55:24,871
A very happy ending, Madame.
Which we both approve.

567
00:55:25,253 --> 00:55:27,173
I do not approve.

568
00:55:27,546 --> 00:55:29,866
I mean, the stag and myself.

569
00:55:30,256 --> 00:55:34,576
No true nobleman would mock the tradition of the hunt like this.
There are things too fine, too sacred, to be made ridiculous.

570
00:55:35,260 --> 00:55:36,980
Oh, Your Highness is losing your temper.

571
00:55:37,345 --> 00:55:41,265
I'm not losing my temper!
You let that stag go!

572
00:55:41,723 --> 00:55:44,643
He'd be caught. And killed.
You wouldn't want that, Madame.

573
00:55:45,058 --> 00:55:47,178
Look... Look at those eyes.

574
00:55:55,274 --> 00:55:57,794
You are not a gentleman.

575
00:55:58,193 --> 00:56:00,713
- You need some lessons.
- And you, Your Highness, are not a woman.

576
00:56:01,528 --> 00:56:05,448
You need some lessons too. You know too much about
hunting, etiquette, tradition...

577
00:56:05,906 --> 00:56:09,826
You know nothing about
style, charm... love.

578
00:56:11,118 --> 00:56:14,638
Look, your riding habit...

579
00:56:15,080 --> 00:56:18,200
It's not graceful,
it's not [...]

580
00:56:18,624 --> 00:56:22,544
And your hair. It's too prim, Madame.
It's to severe.

581
00:56:23,002 --> 00:56:26,922
But your riding habit...
It's discouraging.

582
00:56:28,005 --> 00:56:29,925
What are you doing now?

583
00:56:30,299 --> 00:56:33,019
I'm thinking...
I'm thinking about you without these clothes.

584
00:56:33,426 --> 00:56:35,146
Open your eyes, at once!

585
00:56:35,511 --> 00:56:37,431
Oh no, pardon, Madame.
I mean, with different clothes.

586
00:56:39,055 --> 00:56:40,975
- Smart clothes.
- Here they are...

587
00:56:41,348 --> 00:56:44,268
- The clothes?
- The hunt.

588
00:56:54,691 --> 00:56:56,611
What's the meaning of this?

589
00:56:57,818 --> 00:57:01,458
- The stag, the stag, he's asleep.
- What?!

590
00:57:02,613 --> 00:57:04,533
Shh! We must go back, he's very tired.

591
00:57:08,451 --> 00:57:10,571
Go back, quickly and quietly.

592
00:57:12,412 --> 00:57:16,332
Go back! Quickly and quietly!

593
00:57:16,790 --> 00:57:18,710
On tiptoe.

594
00:57:31,801 --> 00:57:33,521
Madame.

595
00:57:50,355 --> 00:57:52,075
Good hunting?

596
00:57:52,440 --> 00:57:56,360
No luck. The Baron and the deer made friends
and called the whole thing off.

597
00:57:56,818 --> 00:58:00,618
Well I've had good hunting.
There's no such title as Baron de Courtelain.

598
00:58:00,946 --> 00:58:03,106
What?! Gilbert, did you hear that?
Are you sure?

599
00:58:05,158 --> 00:58:07,878
I've even been through the better class
illegitimates.

600
00:58:08,285 --> 00:58:11,205
- And still no Courtelain?
- Not a Courtelain.

601
00:58:11,620 --> 00:58:13,940
Gilbert, who the deuce is your friend?

602
00:58:14,331 --> 00:58:17,691
Well, uncle, I don't think I'd better tell you.
It wouldn't be safe.

603
00:58:18,292 --> 00:58:19,812
Wouldn't be safe?

604
00:58:20,168 --> 00:58:22,088
You see, I owe Maurice something...

605
00:58:22,420 --> 00:58:23,580
You owe him something?!

606
00:58:23,921 --> 00:58:27,441
Uncle, you shouldn't keep repeating
everything I say. You live the life of an echo.

607
00:58:28,090 --> 00:58:30,010
Will you kindly come to the point.

608
00:58:30,863 --> 00:58:34,723
Uncle, we live in an age of toppling thrones...

609
00:58:35,179 --> 00:58:39,499
of uneasy crowns, of persecuted royalty

610
00:58:40,182 --> 00:58:43,102
compelled at times to travel under strange names.
Right?

611
00:58:43,935 --> 00:58:46,055
Are you trying to hint that your friend is royalty?

612
00:58:48,105 --> 00:58:49,625
Well, I...

613
00:58:49,939 --> 00:58:52,299
He has the Hapsburg lip.

614
00:58:52,691 --> 00:58:55,411
And the name Baron Courtelain is...

615
00:58:56,652 --> 00:58:59,772
A mere <i>nom de pullman</i>.

616
00:59:04,992 --> 00:59:10,512

617
00:59:51,441 --> 00:59:54,801
Well, we're all here except the Baron.

618
00:59:55,235 --> 00:59:57,955
- Good, then we're all here.
- Count, could you do something to entertain?

619
00:59:58,363 --> 01:00:00,283
No, I'm helpless since my accident.

620
01:00:00,614 --> 01:00:02,574
- Accident?
- I fell flat on my flute.

621
01:00:06,493 --> 01:00:07,613
Ah, Emperor.

622
01:00:11,288 --> 01:00:13,208
Have you seen Valentine, uncle?

623
01:00:13,582 --> 01:00:15,902
Why no, she's not here either. The Baron
and Valentine are both missing.

624
01:00:16,917 --> 01:00:20,837
It's dangerous to invite guests with a
girl like that around. Somebody will sue us.

625
01:00:21,713 --> 01:00:23,433
Ah, there you are.

626
01:00:23,756 --> 01:00:27,716
The Baron will be down in a moment.
He had to send to Paris for his costume.

627
01:00:28,175 --> 01:00:30,295
I've been watching him put it on.

628
01:00:30,677 --> 01:00:32,597
You've been what?!

629
01:00:34,597 --> 01:00:38,597
It's all right, uncle, she has the room next to Maurice.
And she's bored holes in the connecting door.

630
01:00:39,850 --> 01:00:41,170
Valentine!

631
01:00:42,519 --> 01:00:44,279
Are you aware...?

632
01:00:44,604 --> 01:00:46,564
Are you... Are you...

633
01:00:47,773 --> 01:00:51,693
Are you aware that that door
has come down to us through generations?

634
01:00:52,109 --> 01:00:54,069
So have my instincts.

635
01:00:55,653 --> 01:00:56,813
She had you there, unc.

636
01:00:58,363 --> 01:01:00,723
Will you stop blowing that infernal bladder?!

637
01:01:02,783 --> 01:01:05,703
- Thank you. Thank you.
- How original...

638
01:01:06,077 --> 01:01:08,637
- Thank you, Madame.
- Oh, how intriguing!

639
01:01:08,996 --> 01:01:10,356
How charming!

640
01:01:11,081 --> 01:01:13,041
How common!

641
01:01:13,791 --> 01:01:15,751
Do you find my costume out of place, Madame?

642
01:01:16,084 --> 01:01:18,044
Decidedly.

643
01:01:18,378 --> 01:01:22,338
Maybe you're right.
An apache among all these nobility.

644
01:01:22,756 --> 01:01:26,716
And yet I understand an apache wanting to come.
Where there is beauty and light.

645
01:01:27,134 --> 01:01:29,094
Yes, but people should be on guard against him.

646
01:01:29,427 --> 01:01:31,187
You don't like the apache, eh?

647
01:01:31,512 --> 01:01:34,472
I dislike his attitude toward women.

648
01:01:34,848 --> 01:01:36,808
Oh Madame, you do not understand the apache.

649
01:01:37,183 --> 01:01:39,783
He's not always such a bad fellow.
I'd like to tell you what he really feels.

650
01:01:40,060 --> 01:01:44,020
- I'd love to know.
- And I... am not interested.

651
01:01:44,438 --> 01:01:47,798
Are they always so brutal with girls?

652
01:01:48,190 --> 01:01:51,350
- Haven't they any weak moments?
- How do they live?

653
01:01:51,735 --> 01:01:55,895
I'll tell you the story of one
who I have known.

654
01:02:04,243 --> 01:02:06,803
I wear a sweater, while you wear
a collar and a tie.

655
01:02:07,162 --> 01:02:09,922
Why not?
I'm an apache.

656
01:02:10,498 --> 01:02:13,658
The thing that makes me happy
is you make your woman cry.

657
01:02:14,042 --> 01:02:17,002
Why not?
I'm an apache.

658
01:02:17,378 --> 01:02:19,338
My sweetheart is a shopgirl.
She's a treasure.

659
01:02:19,671 --> 01:02:23,231
And so I am a gentleman
of leisure.

660
01:02:23,632 --> 01:02:25,992
When I grab the wrist and twist it
no woman can resist it.

661
01:02:27,176 --> 01:02:30,136
Why not?
I'm an apache.

662
01:02:30,721 --> 01:02:34,681
And still...
I'd love to treat her pretty.

663
01:02:35,099 --> 01:02:38,059
and take her round the city.
But what's a poor apache got to do.

664
01:02:40,311 --> 01:02:48,271
With one deep sigh.
I will black her eye.

665
01:02:49,692 --> 01:02:53,852
I love to buy things for her
and tell her I adore her

666
01:02:56,155 --> 01:02:59,999
With one good kick...

667
01:03:00,325 --> 01:03:02,285
I make her pay quick.

668
01:03:04,494 --> 01:03:08,054
While all the men are dancing

669
01:03:08,456 --> 01:03:10,616
and tenderly romancing,

670
01:03:11,166 --> 01:03:13,726
I've got to throw her body around.

671
01:03:14,085 --> 01:03:17,645
The spot that no one dares touch,
the spot that only chairs touch,

672
01:03:18,046 --> 01:03:22,006
is frequently touching the ground.

673
01:03:22,340 --> 01:03:24,580
She comes and whispers sweetly,
"I love you so completely".

674
01:03:24,926 --> 01:03:28,286
And then I gently whisper to her:

675
01:03:28,887 --> 01:03:31,047
"Nuts to you!"

676
01:03:32,222 --> 01:03:36,182
That's how I say
"I love you too"

677
01:03:36,809 --> 01:03:40,769
Sad but true.

678
01:03:42,021 --> 01:03:44,781
That's what a poor apache must do...

679
01:03:45,148 --> 01:03:47,108
I was found in a basket,

680
01:03:47,650 --> 01:03:50,210
in front of a church,
but my childhood was not very sainted.

681
01:03:50,777 --> 01:03:54,737
I didn't know my mother,
who didn't know my father...

682
01:03:55,155 --> 01:03:57,315
My parents were not well acquainted.

683
01:03:58,699 --> 01:04:01,659
I soon joined my gang,
who taught me their slang.

684
01:04:02,869 --> 01:04:05,829
And how to pick pockets
and rob girls of lockets.

685
01:04:07,039 --> 01:04:10,999
How I slouch,
in doorways I crouch.

686
01:04:12,668 --> 01:04:16,628
It's a game!
I'm to blame!

687
01:04:17,046 --> 01:04:19,006
But it's [...]
I'm apache.

688
01:04:19,548 --> 01:04:23,508
Maybe some day
I'll be caught at some dirty work

689
01:04:23,926 --> 01:04:27,686
Maybe that day

690
01:04:28,304 --> 01:04:32,864
your police will lead me away.

691
01:04:33,724 --> 01:04:37,964
Maybe I will be seen
by Madame guillotine

692
01:04:44,982 --> 01:04:48,342
And when at last I'm led off

693
01:04:49,152 --> 01:04:54,112
to have them chop my head off,
I tell the executioner this:

694
01:04:55,615 --> 01:04:57,575
"Nuts to you!"

695
01:05:00,827 --> 01:05:03,187
And then I close my eyes of blue.

696
01:05:06,664 --> 01:05:08,424
Sad but true.

697
01:05:09,166 --> 01:05:13,726
That's what a poor apache must do.

698
01:05:16,046 --> 01:05:18,006

699
01:05:22,092 --> 01:05:25,452
- I brought you over here because I want you.
- Oh, Countess!

700
01:05:25,844 --> 01:05:28,204
I want you to keep as far away from me as possible.

701
01:05:28,555 --> 01:05:30,755
Countess, I'll try.

702
01:05:35,435 --> 01:05:38,755
Pardon me, Countess, something I must do.
Some place I must go.

703
01:06:10,876 --> 01:06:12,436
Princess!

704
01:06:16,088 --> 01:06:19,448
Princess, open your eyes, Princess.
Open your eyes.

705
01:06:24,011 --> 01:06:26,411
No, don't open your eyes.
Sleep...

706
01:06:27,805 --> 01:06:31,765
So I can tell you how beautiful you are.

707
01:06:32,392 --> 01:06:35,352
How beautiful...
And how I love you.

708
01:06:59,286 --> 01:07:01,246
How dare you!

709
01:07:04,706 --> 01:07:06,466
Wait...

710
01:07:09,501 --> 01:07:13,461
- Why did you do that?
- Because I love you.

711
01:07:22,886 --> 01:07:25,446
You... you kissd me, Princess.

712
01:07:27,055 --> 01:07:28,615
Why?

713
01:07:31,642 --> 01:07:33,202
Because...

714
01:07:34,144 --> 01:07:36,104
I love you, Maurice.

715
01:07:38,105 --> 01:07:40,465
You... you love me?

716
01:07:42,274 --> 01:07:46,434
Yes. I thought against it,
I was afraid.

717
01:07:47,695 --> 01:07:50,655
Oh, my darling... How foolish I was.

718
01:07:52,698 --> 01:07:55,658
- Perhaps you were wise.
- Why?

719
01:07:56,243 --> 01:08:00,003
Fear is a warning, Princess.

720
01:08:00,829 --> 01:08:02,789
I don't understand you, Maurice.

721
01:08:05,416 --> 01:08:08,576
Let me dream this dream a little longer.

722
01:08:10,002 --> 01:08:13,362
When I wake, I'll go away...

723
01:08:14,589 --> 01:08:16,549
Go away?

724
01:08:17,925 --> 01:08:20,085
Don't you want me, Maurice?

725
01:08:20,426 --> 01:08:22,386
I want you, my Princess.

726
01:08:22,928 --> 01:08:25,888
But I have wanted the moon too.

727
01:08:27,098 --> 01:08:29,458
Look, my hands are empty.

728
01:08:32,935 --> 01:08:36,295
Your arms need ever be empty of me, Maurice.

729
01:08:37,105 --> 01:08:40,065
We have found each other in darkness

730
01:08:40,649 --> 01:08:44,609
like ships that come into harbor

731
01:08:45,027 --> 01:08:46,987
together, at night.

732
01:08:47,737 --> 01:08:51,097
When morning comes,
one's there...

733
01:08:53,575 --> 01:08:55,735
one sails away.

734
01:08:58,161 --> 01:09:02,521
We'll sail together,
or stay together.

735
01:09:05,041 --> 01:09:08,601
I love you, my beautiful Princess.
I love you.

736
01:09:09,628 --> 01:09:12,388
This, I can tell you,
this is mine.

737
01:09:14,006 --> 01:09:16,566
- Jeanette...
- Maurice...

738
01:09:17,967 --> 01:09:20,327
You don't know who I am.

739
01:09:21,303 --> 01:09:24,263
You're you...
And I love you.

740
01:09:26,515 --> 01:09:29,075
But... if I...

741
01:09:29,642 --> 01:09:33,002
If I were not...

742
01:09:33,395 --> 01:09:35,155
what you think I am.

743
01:09:35,688 --> 01:09:38,048
Whoever you are...
Whatever you are...

744
01:09:39,649 --> 01:09:42,009
Wherever you are...

745
01:09:43,402 --> 01:09:45,722
I love you.

746
01:09:50,282 --> 01:09:52,442
Jeanette,
you know what I think?

747
01:09:54,868 --> 01:09:57,028
I think I'm mad.

748
01:09:57,370 --> 01:10:01,330
And that you are mad.
And that the whole world is mad.

749
01:10:01,748 --> 01:10:05,708
But I'm luckiest man of all.
And the happiest.

750
01:10:06,752 --> 01:10:08,712
Listen, my beautiful Princess.

751
01:10:09,253 --> 01:10:11,773
I love you. I love you.

752
01:10:12,381 --> 01:10:15,941
And whatever comes tomorrow...

753
01:10:16,342 --> 01:10:19,262
Love me tonight.
Love me tonight.

754
01:10:56,162 --> 01:11:00,082
"Whoever you are...
whatever you are..."

755
01:11:00,540 --> 01:11:03,500
"Wherever you are...
I love you".

756
01:11:04,084 --> 01:11:05,804
"Oh, my princess..."

757
01:11:06,586 --> 01:11:10,946
"You don't know who I am.
I am... I am a tailor."

758
01:11:11,589 --> 01:11:14,749
"A tailor? A tailor!
Isn't it romantic!"

759
01:11:16,801 --> 01:11:18,761
"Oh, I love you."

760
01:11:20,137 --> 01:11:24,097
Your heart and my heart
were made to meet...

761
01:11:27,017 --> 01:11:31,337
Don't make them wait,
love me tonight.

762
01:11:34,314 --> 01:11:37,234
Why should our lips be afraid to meet.

763
01:11:41,610 --> 01:11:44,530
Love me tonight.

764
01:11:48,282 --> 01:11:52,202
Who knows what
tomorrow brings

765
01:11:54,953 --> 01:11:57,913
with the morning light.

766
01:12:03,501 --> 01:12:05,421
Dear, I am here
with a heart that sings

767
01:12:09,755 --> 01:12:12,675
Love me tonight...

768
01:12:23,098 --> 01:12:25,018
Let me see.

769
01:12:27,268 --> 01:12:29,188
There...

770
01:12:31,020 --> 01:12:32,940
There, it's superb!

771
01:12:33,314 --> 01:12:34,314
Come in.

772
01:12:36,858 --> 01:12:39,578
- You sent for me, Princess?
- Yes.

773
01:12:40,819 --> 01:12:42,059
Yes...?

774
01:12:43,863 --> 01:12:44,903
Yes...

775
01:12:48,324 --> 01:12:52,244
I'd like your advice on my new riding habit.

776
01:12:52,702 --> 01:12:54,022
Beautiful.

777
01:12:54,370 --> 01:12:56,690
- Do you really think so?
- Perfect.

778
01:12:57,081 --> 01:12:59,001
How about the length?

779
01:13:00,208 --> 01:13:01,528
Divine...

780
01:13:03,335 --> 01:13:05,255
Here, look at it more closely.

781
01:13:08,339 --> 01:13:12,379
The closer I get,
the more perfect.

782
01:13:13,342 --> 01:13:15,662
Monsieur has taste.

783
01:13:16,261 --> 01:13:20,181
- How about the color?
- Lucky color.

784
01:13:23,558 --> 01:13:25,078
Anything wrong?

785
01:13:25,434 --> 01:13:30,354
Certainly. The color rides up!
Oh no, that won't do at all.

786
01:13:31,229 --> 01:13:32,149
You think so, Monsieur?

787
01:13:32,522 --> 01:13:35,842
Oh yes, Madame, yes.
And look, it's too tight here, Madame.

788
01:13:36,275 --> 01:13:39,195
It's too tight across the chest.

789
01:13:39,611 --> 01:13:42,131
And the lapels, they're too stiff.

790
01:13:42,529 --> 01:13:45,049
No, no... Really...
The whole thing lacks smartness,

791
01:13:45,448 --> 01:13:47,968
youth, grace.
No, no, no...

792
01:13:48,367 --> 01:13:50,887
Your Highness, I have never been so insulted!

793
01:13:51,286 --> 01:13:53,806
With your permission, I'm going!

794
01:13:54,371 --> 01:13:56,131
Madame Pituar...!

795
01:14:02,127 --> 01:14:04,447
Maurice, what am I going to do now?

796
01:14:05,045 --> 01:14:08,365
Don't worry, Jeanette.
We'll fix it.

797
01:14:08,798 --> 01:14:10,118
How?

798
01:14:11,300 --> 01:14:12,620
We'll fix it!

799
01:14:14,219 --> 01:14:17,139
No, no...
That's not possible...

800
01:14:18,388 --> 01:14:20,908
We'll make you a riding habit...

801
01:14:22,766 --> 01:14:25,086
that will tame Solitude!

802
01:14:26,102 --> 01:14:27,222
But how?

803
01:14:28,395 --> 01:14:31,315
The important thing is not to hurry.

804
01:14:35,692 --> 01:14:38,212
What's the matter?

805
01:14:39,445 --> 01:14:42,165
Who insulted you?

806
01:14:42,572 --> 01:14:44,892

807
01:14:45,282 --> 01:14:47,202

808
01:14:47,575 --> 01:14:50,495

809
01:14:51,203 --> 01:14:52,663
Madame Pituar has been insulted!

810
01:14:53,621 --> 01:14:55,341
Madame Pituar has been insulted!

811
01:14:55,706 --> 01:14:57,586
At her age? Remarkable!

812
01:14:57,833 --> 01:14:59,293
Madame Pituar has been insulted!

813
01:14:59,356 --> 01:15:02,056
Some men have no taste!

814
01:15:02,795 --> 01:15:05,555
Madame Pituar has been insulted!

815
01:15:05,922 --> 01:15:07,322
The old girl must have something.

816
01:15:07,548 --> 01:15:10,308

817
01:15:10,717 --> 01:15:12,637

818
01:15:13,010 --> 01:15:14,930

819
01:15:15,303 --> 01:15:18,623
Shh! Let us look into this!

820
01:15:30,523 --> 01:15:32,843
What's this?! An outrage!

821
01:15:33,233 --> 01:15:35,153
A scandal!

822
01:15:35,526 --> 01:15:37,446
- I'll shoot him!
- Oh, let me die!

823
01:15:37,819 --> 01:15:41,739
Let me explain.
I was only fixing the Princess's riding habit.

824
01:15:42,197 --> 01:15:44,317
- What?!
- Uncle, that's the truth.

825
01:15:44,699 --> 01:15:48,659
- Preposterous!
- I give you my word of honor.

826
01:15:48,869 --> 01:15:51,789
Why, the Baron often gives people
advice about their clothes.

827
01:15:52,205 --> 01:15:55,125
Be quiet!
What you say is insulting!

828
01:15:55,540 --> 01:15:57,860
- I'll run him through for this.
- You've already shot him.

829
01:15:58,250 --> 01:15:59,370
Silence!

830
01:15:59,710 --> 01:16:03,950
I'll prove I'm telling the truth. Give me
two hours and I'll remodel this riding habit.

831
01:16:07,841 --> 01:16:12,200
What?! Alright! I'll convict you by
your own falsehood! I'll give you two hours, sir.

832
01:16:12,219 --> 01:16:14,939
- He'll do it.
- I'll bet he can't do it.

833
01:16:15,346 --> 01:16:18,306
- I'll bet you 10,000 francs he can.
- I'll bet you 50,000 he's a liar. - Done!

834
01:16:18,598 --> 01:16:20,598
Your Grace, time flies.

835
01:16:20,850 --> 01:16:23,890
Quite right. Leave them alone, everybody.

836
01:16:24,311 --> 01:16:27,911
- I'll give you two hours, sir!
- 50,000 francs, now, eh?

837
01:16:29,523 --> 01:16:31,443
Maurice, what will you do now?

838
01:16:31,816 --> 01:16:34,736
You'll see.
Two hours to go.

839
01:16:36,611 --> 01:16:38,531
Wait a minute... now...
and this...

840
01:16:39,738 --> 01:16:41,258
Now I start.

841
01:16:43,282 --> 01:16:44,802
Five.

842
01:16:46,410 --> 01:16:47,930
Twelve.

843
01:16:51,830 --> 01:16:53,150
Twenty two.

844
01:16:59,544 --> 01:17:01,264
Twenty eight.

845
01:17:14,138 --> 01:17:15,858
Excuse me...

846
01:17:51,456 --> 01:17:53,416
How do you like it?

847
01:17:54,166 --> 01:17:55,686
It's perfect!

848
01:17:56,042 --> 01:17:59,962
Of course, if I had more time...

849
01:18:00,420 --> 01:18:02,340
It's too perfect...

850
01:18:02,714 --> 01:18:09,034
Tell me, how did you make this habit in
two hours? How were you able to make it at all?

851
01:18:12,095 --> 01:18:13,415
Because...

852
01:18:16,265 --> 01:18:18,985
Because I am a tailor...

853
01:18:21,060 --> 01:18:22,380
What?

854
01:18:23,353 --> 01:18:24,833
A tailor.

855
01:18:27,898 --> 01:18:29,858
Oh Maurice, you're joking.

856
01:18:32,943 --> 01:18:39,263
No. I'm not a baron. I am a tailor.

857
01:18:50,664 --> 01:18:53,384
Does that make so much difference?

858
01:18:55,835 --> 01:18:57,795
A tailor...

859
01:19:01,297 --> 01:19:05,217
Last night... you said to me...
"Whoever you are..."

860
01:19:07,134 --> 01:19:11,054
"Whatever you are...
Wherever you are..."

861
01:19:11,512 --> 01:19:13,832
"I love you."
Remember?

862
01:19:19,226 --> 01:19:22,346
Jeanette, what happened?

863
01:19:26,106 --> 01:19:28,226
Why, Baron, what happened?

864
01:19:29,608 --> 01:19:33,568
I just told her I'm not a baron.
I'm a tailor.

865
01:19:34,612 --> 01:19:37,572
- A tailor?
- Yes, a tailor.

866
01:19:54,042 --> 01:19:55,962
Help!

867
01:19:57,128 --> 01:19:59,088
Help!

868
01:20:04,216 --> 01:20:08,096
The Baron! He's not a baron!
He's a tailor!

869
01:20:08,386 --> 01:20:09,386
What?!

870
01:20:09,553 --> 01:20:12,793
- The Baron! He's not a baron!
- He's a tailor!

871
01:20:23,813 --> 01:20:25,973
What do you know about this?!

872
01:20:26,524 --> 01:20:30,484
Well I... you see, I owed him some bills.

873
01:20:30,902 --> 01:20:33,100
Bills! I'll deal with you later!

874
01:20:33,195 --> 01:20:37,155
But first I'll get Flammand to give
this tradesman his money and kick him out!

875
01:20:42,160 --> 01:20:44,120


876
01:20:45,079 --> 01:20:47,039
A tailor!

877
01:20:48,039 --> 01:20:49,959

878
01:20:51,541 --> 01:20:53,501

879
01:20:58,421 --> 01:21:00,181

880
01:21:02,508 --> 01:21:06,548
A tailor... a tailor...
The bounder is a tailor.

881
01:21:06,969 --> 01:21:10,529
The Princess mustn't hear of this
or the breaths of life would fail her.

882
01:21:10,930 --> 01:21:13,490
I'd rather throw a bomb at her
than have her wed a commoner

883
01:21:13,849 --> 01:21:17,809
and nothing would be commoner
than a commoner who's a tailor.

884
01:21:18,769 --> 01:21:22,129
- A tailor! - A tailor!
- The bounder is a tailor!

885
01:21:22,397 --> 01:21:25,717
The news would make your ancestor
upon the wall grow paler.

886
01:21:26,149 --> 01:21:30,709
If painted ears could hear at all
that frame would crash from off the wall.

887
01:21:34,697 --> 01:21:37,257
The son of a gun is nothing but a tailor.

888
01:21:41,994 --> 01:21:45,154
The son of a gun is nothing but a tailor.

889
01:21:55,128 --> 01:21:59,088
Come here, you geese, the great Maurice
is not a knight of the golden fleece.

890
01:21:59,923 --> 01:22:02,483
The son of a gun is nothing but a tailor.

891
01:22:02,842 --> 01:22:07,002
My Lord, I said [...]
and now I wish I was dead instead.

892
01:22:07,428 --> 01:22:10,508
The son of a gun is nothing but a tailor.

893
01:22:10,764 --> 01:22:14,724
It makes me boild with rage to think
I blacked his boots.

894
01:22:15,142 --> 01:22:17,102
I should have blacked
his eye!

895
01:22:18,478 --> 01:22:21,638
To think I pressed
his coat and vest

896
01:22:22,022 --> 01:22:25,102
when he's the one who can press the best.
The son of a gun is nothing but a tailor.

897
01:22:25,400 --> 01:22:29,520
I made the bed where he laid his head
and now my cheeks are burning red.

898
01:22:29,944 --> 01:22:32,904
The son of a gun is nothing but a tailor.

899
01:22:33,489 --> 01:22:36,849
I used to flirt until it hurt
while he stood there in his undershirt.

900
01:22:37,700 --> 01:22:39,220
The son of a gun is nothing but a tailor.

901
01:22:40,869 --> 01:22:43,549
[...]

902
01:22:44,121 --> 01:22:48,081
[...]

903
01:22:50,167 --> 01:22:54,127
Imagine cooking pheasant for
a guy who's just a peasant for
the son of a gun is nothing but a tailor.

904
01:22:56,255 --> 01:23:01,375
Working with a red hot iron
makes a lady keep perspiring
til her strength is just about to fail her.

905
01:23:01,842 --> 01:23:06,802
But it's worth to stand above
a board and scrub the britches of
a son of a gun who's nothing but a tailor.

906
01:23:07,096 --> 01:23:10,216
Down upon my hands and knees
washing up his BVDs

907
01:23:10,598 --> 01:23:12,558
this is a job that hardly pleases me.

908
01:23:12,892 --> 01:23:17,052
If I had known I would've tore
the buttons of his panties for
the son of a gun is nothing but a tailor.

909
01:23:22,482 --> 01:23:24,642
Nothing but a tailor!

910
01:23:29,361 --> 01:23:31,521
Nothing but a tailor.

911
01:23:35,824 --> 01:23:37,784
The son of a gun is nothing but a tailor.

912
01:23:39,224 --> 01:23:40,524
The son of a gun is nothing but a tailor.

913
01:23:42,704 --> 01:23:44,864
The son of a gun is nothing but a tailor.

914
01:23:46,332 --> 01:23:48,412
The son of a gun is nothing but a tailor.

915
01:23:49,793 --> 01:23:51,953
The son of a gun is nothing but a tailor.

916
01:23:53,545 --> 01:23:55,905
The son of a gun is nothing but a tailor.

917
01:23:57,089 --> 01:23:59,249
The son of a gun is nothing but a tailor.

918
01:24:00,634 --> 01:24:02,714
The son of a gun is nothing but a tailor.

919
01:24:21,899 --> 01:24:23,859
The son of a gun is nothing but a tailor.

920
01:24:24,192 --> 01:24:25,952
The son of a gun is nothing but a tailor.

921
01:24:26,277 --> 01:24:29,037
"Does it make so much difference?"

922
01:24:30,113 --> 01:24:33,793
"I love you, I love you.
This, I can tell you, this is mine."

923
01:24:34,199 --> 01:24:37,159
"- I love you, Maurice.
- You don't know who I am."

924
01:24:37,535 --> 01:24:41,895
"Whoever you are. Whatever you are.
Wherever you are. I love you."

925
01:24:43,706 --> 01:24:47,666
Your heart and my heart
were meant to meet.

926
01:24:48,293 --> 01:24:52,453
Don't make them wait,
love me tonight.

927
01:24:55,381 --> 01:24:58,341
Why should our lips be afraid to meet.

928
01:25:01,635 --> 01:25:03,795
Love me tonight...

929
01:25:07,473 --> 01:25:11,433
Who knows what
tomorrow brings,

930
01:25:12,060 --> 01:25:15,020
with the morning light.

931
01:25:20,399 --> 01:25:22,759
Dear, I am here
with a heart that sings.

932
01:25:29,780 --> 01:25:32,740
Love me tonight.

933
01:25:43,373 --> 01:25:45,733
Princess! Princess!

934
01:25:46,084 --> 01:25:49,044
Jeanette! Jeanette!

935
01:27:04,472 --> 01:27:06,432
- Maurice!
- Princess!

936
01:27:06,766 --> 01:27:11,150
- Stop the train! I'm coming with you!
- Oh no, Your Highness forgets I'm a tailor.

937
01:27:11,186 --> 01:27:13,346
I love you! I can't live without you!

938
01:27:13,562 --> 01:27:17,962
I love you,
but you couldn't be a tailor's wife.

939
01:27:18,315 --> 01:27:19,355
I could and I will!

940
01:27:19,608 --> 01:27:24,048
- Stop the train!
- No, I love you too much. [...] Goodbye.

941
01:27:31,158 --> 01:27:33,438
- Stop the train!
- What happened?

942
01:27:33,660 --> 01:27:35,820
I love him!

943
01:27:36,370 --> 01:27:39,290
- That's not a railroad problem!
- Stop this train!

944
01:27:39,539 --> 01:27:40,939
No! No!

945
01:28:19,526 --> 01:28:20,886
Jeanette!

946
01:28:21,194 --> 01:28:23,354
Come, darling, come...

947
01:28:33,286 --> 01:28:37,246
Once upon a time there was a Princess
and a Prince Charming...

948
01:28:37,664 --> 01:28:40,624
- Who was not a prince.
- But who <i>was</i> charming.

949
01:28:41,000 --> 01:28:44,360
And they lived happily ever after...
