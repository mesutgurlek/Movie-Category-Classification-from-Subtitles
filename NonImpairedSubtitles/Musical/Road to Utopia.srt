1
00:00:28,695 --> 00:00:31,960
For those of you who
don't go to the movies,
let me introduce myself.

2
00:00:32,032 --> 00:00:34,227
My name is
Robert Benchley.

3
00:00:34,300 --> 00:00:36,700
Well, no matter.

4
00:00:36,770 --> 00:00:40,297
For one reason or another,
the motion picture which
you are about to see...

5
00:00:40,373 --> 00:00:42,398
is not very
clear in spots.

6
00:00:42,475 --> 00:00:46,241
As a matter of fact,
it was made to demonstrate how
not to make a motion picture...

7
00:00:46,312 --> 00:00:49,372
and at the same time
win an Academy Award.

8
00:00:49,449 --> 00:00:53,783
Now, someone in what is
known as ''the front office''...

9
00:00:53,853 --> 00:00:56,822
has thought that an
occasional word from me...

10
00:00:56,890 --> 00:01:01,020
might help clarify
the plot and other vague
portions of the film.

11
00:01:01,094 --> 00:01:03,858
Personally, I doubt it.

12
00:01:03,930 --> 00:01:06,023
Shall we go?

13
00:02:30,817 --> 00:02:33,911
It's 8:00, Pa.

14
00:02:33,987 --> 00:02:37,320
Bedtime.
Put down that paper.

15
00:02:37,390 --> 00:02:40,188
In a minute, Ma.
In a minute.

16
00:02:40,260 --> 00:02:42,194
Land's sakes, pa.

17
00:02:42,262 --> 00:02:46,323
Sittin'there night after night
pouring your eyes out
over that old stock market.

18
00:02:46,399 --> 00:02:48,867
Think by now
you'd be tired of it.

19
00:02:48,935 --> 00:02:53,065
Well, 'tain't easy, ma,
to change the habits of a lifetime.

20
00:02:53,139 --> 00:02:56,370
Lot of nonsense--all that
buyin'and sellin'-- Bulls and Bears.

21
00:02:56,442 --> 00:03:00,003
Can't see how
a body can figure it out.

22
00:03:00,079 --> 00:03:04,516
Right now it's
kind of bearish,
Ma, kind of bearish.

23
00:03:04,584 --> 00:03:06,745
Come along,
it's 8:00.

24
00:03:06,819 --> 00:03:09,913
I'm not a child. I know
when it's time to go to bed.

25
00:03:09,989 --> 00:03:12,423
Pa!
It's time.

26
00:03:12,492 --> 00:03:16,553
Come on, Pa.
Doc says I can stay
up till half past.

27
00:03:16,629 --> 00:03:20,827
I know, but by the time
we get your ears washed
and your teeth put away--

28
00:03:20,900 --> 00:03:24,631
All right, I guess.
Here we go.

29
00:03:24,704 --> 00:03:27,867
Look and see if
everything got up with me.

30
00:03:27,941 --> 00:03:30,637
#For always #

31
00:03:30,710 --> 00:03:35,306
Do you hear
what I hear?
I hope not.

32
00:03:35,381 --> 00:03:37,781
That voice.
What voice?

33
00:03:37,850 --> 00:03:42,583
Listen. What does it
sound like?
Who'd be sellin'
fish at this hour?

34
00:03:42,655 --> 00:03:46,682
After 3 5 years--
Pa, you don't think--

35
00:03:46,759 --> 00:03:48,989
Oh, no,
it couldn't be.

36
00:03:49,062 --> 00:03:53,260
But it is. That voice.
I'd know it anywhere.

37
00:03:53,333 --> 00:03:55,563
You would, huh?

38
00:03:55,635 --> 00:03:58,331
Shuck and gosh darn it.

39
00:04:06,446 --> 00:04:10,109
And I thought this was
gonna be an ''A'' picture.
Duke!

40
00:04:10,183 --> 00:04:12,083
Sal!
Duke.!

41
00:04:12,151 --> 00:04:14,779
Sal!
It isn't true.
I don't believe it.

42
00:04:14,854 --> 00:04:16,947
Just got in from Alaska
and I came right to you.

43
00:04:17,023 --> 00:04:20,151
Right from out
of the grave.
Nice diggin', hmm?

44
00:04:20,226 --> 00:04:22,524
My, uh, nieces.

45
00:04:22,595 --> 00:04:25,029
Girls, old friends of
your uncle's, the Hootons.

46
00:04:25,098 --> 00:04:26,656
How do you do?

47
00:04:26,733 --> 00:04:30,669
Just think, 3 5 years, Duke.
It doesn't seem possible.

48
00:04:30,737 --> 00:04:34,571
Sal, let me look at you.
You're a sight for sore eyes.

49
00:04:34,641 --> 00:04:37,132
And Chester,
you're a sight.

50
00:04:37,210 --> 00:04:40,441
Don't forget a man is
just as young as he feels.

51
00:04:42,815 --> 00:04:45,784
Take 'em away. The doctor
says I can't have 'em anymore.

52
00:04:45,852 --> 00:04:48,753
You've got very little
to complain about.

53
00:04:48,821 --> 00:04:51,346
You won the girl,
got the gold mine-- All this.

54
00:04:51,424 --> 00:04:54,018
Things have surely
stacked up well for you.

55
00:04:54,093 --> 00:04:57,187
Who's doin' your
stackin' lately?
Chester!

56
00:04:57,263 --> 00:05:00,255
Girls, the Hootons and I
have a few things to discuss.

57
00:05:00,333 --> 00:05:04,292
If you'll run along, Uncle will
meet you later at the club.

58
00:05:04,370 --> 00:05:06,634
Nice goin',
''Uncle.''

59
00:05:06,706 --> 00:05:09,937
Nice family tree and
the limbs ain't bad either.

60
00:05:10,009 --> 00:05:12,807
Duke, tell us
all about Alaska.

61
00:05:12,879 --> 00:05:16,246
We left you for dead.
How did you ever get away?

62
00:05:16,316 --> 00:05:19,479
It's a long story.
I wouldn't want to bore you.

63
00:05:19,552 --> 00:05:21,884
It's never
stopped you before.

64
00:05:21,954 --> 00:05:24,821
Tell us.
You remember when
it all started.

65
00:05:24,891 --> 00:05:28,827
Chester and I were
playing San Francisco.
The turn of the century.

66
00:05:28,895 --> 00:05:32,058
There was gold in the Klondike
and San Francisco was wide open.

67
00:05:32,131 --> 00:05:34,759
A million suckers just
waitin' to be clipped.

68
00:05:34,834 --> 00:05:38,270
There was excitement
and adventure.
There was romance.

69
00:05:38,338 --> 00:05:40,568
And one night, you remember,
there was murder.

70
00:05:45,578 --> 00:05:48,672
This is a device
known as ''the flashback.''

71
00:05:48,748 --> 00:05:51,182
Okay, George.

72
00:06:01,461 --> 00:06:03,759
Gold!
Millions!

73
00:06:06,866 --> 00:06:08,925
Open up.

74
00:06:12,338 --> 00:06:17,867
What happened?
Sperry, McGurk...
the window.

75
00:06:17,944 --> 00:06:21,505
What is it,
Mr. Lattimer?

76
00:06:21,581 --> 00:06:26,609
They got it--
The map, your father's mine.

77
00:06:26,686 --> 00:06:29,120
The police
will get them.

78
00:06:29,188 --> 00:06:32,624
Never.
They're too smart.

79
00:06:32,692 --> 00:06:35,217
But Mr. Lattimer--

80
00:06:35,294 --> 00:06:37,626
Alaska--

81
00:06:37,697 --> 00:06:41,133
Go to Skagway.

82
00:06:41,200 --> 00:06:46,103
Ask for Ace Larson.
Ace Larson?

83
00:06:51,411 --> 00:06:55,939
Where do I arrange my passage?
No time, lady.
Get it on board.

84
00:06:56,015 --> 00:06:58,245
- Take it away,Joe.
- Right, Cap.

85
00:06:58,317 --> 00:07:01,013
You better hurry,
we're shovin' off.
Thank you.

86
00:07:03,122 --> 00:07:05,454
Take it away,
boys.

87
00:07:06,659 --> 00:07:10,356
Hey, look!
We've gotta
get on that boat.

88
00:07:10,430 --> 00:07:13,365
Too late, mister.
Next boat's tonight at midnight.

89
00:07:13,433 --> 00:07:17,267
Extra.! Murder in Hotel Room.
Read all about it.

90
00:07:17,336 --> 00:07:20,601
Map of Van Hoyden Mine Stolen.
Extra.! Read all about it.!

91
00:07:27,980 --> 00:07:30,210
It's them!

92
00:07:30,283 --> 00:07:32,979
Who?
Sperry and McGurk.

93
00:07:42,462 --> 00:07:56,138
##

94
00:07:56,209 --> 00:08:00,373
# Everybody here knows
Good Time Charlie #

95
00:08:00,446 --> 00:08:03,244
# Charlie is
a perfect clown #

96
00:08:03,316 --> 00:08:06,945
#Always kills the folks
with funny jokes #

97
00:08:07,019 --> 00:08:10,614
#And turns the parlor
upside down #

98
00:08:10,690 --> 00:08:14,421
# Everybody sure likes
Good Time Charlie #

99
00:08:14,494 --> 00:08:17,930
# No one ever
saw him frown #

100
00:08:17,997 --> 00:08:19,988
# But here's
the funniest part #

101
00:08:20,066 --> 00:08:23,797
# Down deep
in his heart #

102
00:08:23,870 --> 00:08:28,068
# He's the lonesomest
man in town #

103
00:08:28,140 --> 00:08:33,305
Charlie, why are you on this
mad, mad merry-go-round?
Ha, ha, ha.

104
00:08:33,379 --> 00:08:35,847
I'm your friend.

105
00:08:35,915 --> 00:08:38,076
You can tell me,
Charlie.

106
00:08:38,150 --> 00:08:40,675
You're wasting
your life away.

107
00:08:40,753 --> 00:08:43,449
Someday you'll be
old and all alone.

108
00:08:43,523 --> 00:08:45,753
Think it over.

109
00:08:45,825 --> 00:08:47,918
You're not fooling me,
Charlie.

110
00:08:47,994 --> 00:08:50,326
It's your childhood
sweetheart.

111
00:08:50,396 --> 00:08:52,762
But you're a great,
great man.

112
00:08:52,832 --> 00:08:55,460
Great to take it
the way you have.

113
00:08:56,903 --> 00:09:00,236
You're doin' the
right thing. Laugh!
Ha, ha, ha.

114
00:09:00,306 --> 00:09:01,830
Dance!

115
00:09:01,908 --> 00:09:03,500
Play the fool!

116
00:09:05,111 --> 00:09:10,640
# He's the lonesomest
man in town #

117
00:09:10,716 --> 00:09:14,982
#The lonesomest
man in town #

118
00:09:27,900 --> 00:09:30,494
Three, a-two,
a-three, a-four.

119
00:09:43,716 --> 00:09:46,082
# He's always
good for a laugh #

120
00:09:46,152 --> 00:09:48,780
# But...
you don't know the half #

121
00:09:48,854 --> 00:09:51,186
# He's only
happy-go-lucky #

122
00:09:51,257 --> 00:09:53,350
#Till the lights
are turned down #

123
00:09:53,426 --> 00:09:57,157
#Then he's the lonesomest
man in town ##

124
00:10:07,206 --> 00:10:10,642
And now, to go from the
super to the supernatural,

125
00:10:10,710 --> 00:10:12,644
we bring you
''Ghost-O,''

126
00:10:12,712 --> 00:10:15,374
the most amazing
novelty game of the age,

127
00:10:15,448 --> 00:10:16,972
stolen at great personal risk...

128
00:10:17,049 --> 00:10:19,813
from the high priest of
the Lost Tribe of Darkest Anesthesia...

129
00:10:19,885 --> 00:10:23,150
and brought to these shores by
that great oriental mystic...

130
00:10:23,222 --> 00:10:26,919
and secret Hindu potentate,
professor Hakin Zambini.!

131
00:10:26,993 --> 00:10:28,893
And now, ''Ghost-O''...

132
00:10:28,961 --> 00:10:32,089
and the man who
has brought fortunes to
thousands of lucky people,

133
00:10:32,164 --> 00:10:34,496
professor Zambini.

134
00:10:36,569 --> 00:10:38,560
Holy Toledo!
Holy Toledo!

135
00:10:38,638 --> 00:10:41,436
Bushwa.
Silence, dear friends.

136
00:10:41,507 --> 00:10:44,135
I shall attempt to
contact the other world.

137
00:10:44,210 --> 00:10:46,303
Master, shall
I remove myself?

138
00:10:46,379 --> 00:10:49,371
The spirit will
do it for us.

139
00:10:52,718 --> 00:10:57,280
Ala-kaballa, presto-sturgando,
double-forzando.

140
00:11:00,660 --> 00:11:03,128
Silence!
Silence, dear friends.

141
00:11:03,195 --> 00:11:05,220
I feel the presence
of spirits in the room.

142
00:11:05,297 --> 00:11:07,458
What I do
for money.

143
00:11:07,533 --> 00:11:12,766
Matoom-bomba.
Diddy-wa-diddy matoom-bomba.

144
00:11:12,838 --> 00:11:14,772
Diddy-wa-diddy, ester-chay.
The oint-jay is ull-fay of ump-chays--

145
00:11:14,840 --> 00:11:19,334
Ump-chays--
There's one here, too.

146
00:11:20,513 --> 00:11:22,447
Spirits,
are you with us?

147
00:11:22,515 --> 00:11:26,076
Are you there?
Am I there?
Where can I go?

148
00:11:26,152 --> 00:11:29,212
- Are you there?
- If I was, I wouldn't be here.

149
00:11:29,288 --> 00:11:32,689
Spirits,
are you with us?

150
00:11:32,758 --> 00:11:35,727
That's the spirit!
We have made contact.

151
00:11:35,795 --> 00:11:39,629
To prove it, I shall have
the spirit do my bidding.
Spirit, lift the table.

152
00:11:39,699 --> 00:11:42,361
Spirit, lift.!

153
00:11:44,103 --> 00:11:46,936
The flesh is willing but
the spirits are weak.

154
00:11:47,006 --> 00:11:49,702
However, we shall proceed
with the magic game of Ghost-O.

155
00:11:49,775 --> 00:11:52,107
Taking this
fabulously jeweled box,

156
00:11:52,178 --> 00:11:55,409
I shall place
a five-dollar bill therein,

157
00:11:55,481 --> 00:11:57,540
close the
box regretfully,

158
00:11:57,616 --> 00:11:59,914
incant a few magic
words thereover,

159
00:11:59,985 --> 00:12:03,216
and gamble upon the
generosity of the spirits.

160
00:12:03,289 --> 00:12:08,625
Matoom-bomba Ester-chay,
willet-gay under-day
dwit-ay matoom-bomba.

161
00:12:10,563 --> 00:12:13,862
What have we here?
A crisp ten-dollar bill.

162
00:12:13,933 --> 00:12:16,367
Indeed, the spirits
are generous tonight.

163
00:12:16,435 --> 00:12:18,733
Why am I monopolizing
this lucrative phenomenon?

164
00:12:18,804 --> 00:12:21,170
Who among you would
like to try for 1 0,

165
00:12:21,240 --> 00:12:23,504
20, 30 dollars--
any small amount?

166
00:12:23,576 --> 00:12:25,441
I'll try
for a dollar.

167
00:12:25,511 --> 00:12:28,002
A dollar? An assignment
for one of the smaller spirits;

168
00:12:28,080 --> 00:12:31,311
however, a buck is a buck and
the spirits are always in there.

169
00:12:31,383 --> 00:12:35,149
Matoom-bomba
matoom a-double-bomba.

170
00:12:35,221 --> 00:12:40,181
A crisp new
five-dollar bill.

171
00:12:40,259 --> 00:12:44,628
Five for one. Here you are.
Who among you shall be next?

172
00:12:44,697 --> 00:12:46,892
10 dollars!
I'll try for 15.

173
00:12:46,966 --> 00:12:50,868
We are building, however,
it's a big box and there's
room in there for both of you.

174
00:12:50,936 --> 00:12:53,871
The spirits will have to
take dead aim this time.
Atch-it-way, Ester-chay.

175
00:12:53,939 --> 00:12:56,737
Matoom-bomba, Sam-cheron
on-the-half-shell.

176
00:12:56,809 --> 00:12:59,676
Hiya, George!
Welcome home, Abe!

177
00:13:01,480 --> 00:13:05,314
Looks like a spirit got
away with this one, folks.

178
00:13:05,384 --> 00:13:08,751
That's the spirit.
Sometimes he puts,
sometimes he takes.

179
00:13:08,821 --> 00:13:12,120
Who's next? Just
bring a buck in a truck.

180
00:13:12,191 --> 00:13:14,989
Ten dollars.
Twenty-five.

181
00:13:15,060 --> 00:13:17,688
Twenty dollars here.
Don't get shut out.

182
00:13:20,065 --> 00:13:23,466
Wait a minute.
Let's try in here.

183
00:13:27,506 --> 00:13:29,599
There they are!

184
00:13:29,675 --> 00:13:31,734
Out the
back way!

185
00:13:33,078 --> 00:13:37,913
Just a moment,
please.

186
00:13:37,983 --> 00:13:40,816
They don't seem to
think we're on the level.

187
00:13:40,886 --> 00:13:43,787
Some people are
so suspicious.

188
00:13:46,492 --> 00:13:50,519
Ghost-O! I didn't think there
was one more way to get the cops
after us, but you found it!

189
00:13:50,596 --> 00:13:53,429
50 for Duke, 50 for Chester.
1 0 for Duke, 1 0 for Chester.

190
00:13:53,499 --> 00:13:58,368
Some life. Always one jump
ahead of the Sheriff.
5 for Duke, 5 for Chester.

191
00:13:58,437 --> 00:14:01,634
That boat sails
in 20 minutes.
Let it sail.

192
00:14:01,707 --> 00:14:03,834
Look, mastermind,
the tour is over.

193
00:14:03,909 --> 00:14:06,139
We've been posse-baitin'
every town from coast to coast.

194
00:14:06,212 --> 00:14:10,410
We just ran out of towns.
From now on, it's oceans
and we take boats.

195
00:14:10,482 --> 00:14:13,918
A Confederate ten-spot!
How can people be so crooked?

196
00:14:13,986 --> 00:14:17,444
We're taking
the boat to New York.
Not that boat.

197
00:14:17,523 --> 00:14:20,981
Going the wrong way?
It's going south,
should be going north.

198
00:14:21,060 --> 00:14:24,552
Going north?
Where they got that yellow stuff...
that ever-lovin' powder.

199
00:14:24,630 --> 00:14:26,894
Gold?
That's right.

200
00:14:26,966 --> 00:14:28,957
Alaska!
Yes.

201
00:14:29,034 --> 00:14:32,663
No you don't! Alaska?
It's so cold...

202
00:14:32,738 --> 00:14:34,672
if you shake hands,
they take it and throw it away.

203
00:14:34,740 --> 00:14:38,039
It's Utopia.
Everybody's getting gold.

204
00:14:38,110 --> 00:14:40,408
I got all the gold
I want in my teeth.

205
00:14:40,479 --> 00:14:42,811
I'm takin' my dough to Brooklyn
and opening a Turkish bath--
with tables for ladies.

206
00:14:42,882 --> 00:14:46,249
Where're you going
with all that cabbage?
I'm gonna pickle it.

207
00:14:46,318 --> 00:14:49,719
Yours? All of it?
What happened to 50-50?
All of it.

208
00:14:49,788 --> 00:14:54,225
You've been leading me
by the nose, chiseling
me right and left.

209
00:14:54,293 --> 00:14:57,592
Me chiseling you?
I got a record
of every chizz.

210
00:14:57,663 --> 00:15:00,257
This is fantastic.
It's right here
in black and white.

211
00:15:00,332 --> 00:15:02,698
Niagara Falls...
$300 for hospital bills.

212
00:15:02,768 --> 00:15:05,999
All you had to do was
find some yokel and send him
over the falls in a barrel.

213
00:15:06,071 --> 00:15:08,767
It was a great stunt.
I almost
broke my neck.

214
00:15:08,841 --> 00:15:11,173
Pittsburgh, Chicago,
and how 'bout Kansas City?

215
00:15:11,243 --> 00:15:15,509
You picked my pocket of
7 5 bucks so you could take
Mabel Bronschweiger on a buggy.

216
00:15:15,581 --> 00:15:19,142
Mabel Bronschweiger.
Lady blacksmith.
She was your girl.

217
00:15:19,218 --> 00:15:23,018
I sat in the hotel lobby
while you took her for
a ride in the woods.

218
00:15:23,088 --> 00:15:26,888
She was in fresh air.
Didn't I front for
you in Oklahoma?

219
00:15:26,959 --> 00:15:29,985
Hilda,
the oilman's daughter?
Sent you in there.

220
00:15:30,062 --> 00:15:33,520
Was she born or did
they have to drill for her?

221
00:15:33,599 --> 00:15:36,329
$1 200 worth right there,
but I'll settle for this.

222
00:15:36,402 --> 00:15:39,633
You wanna go to Alaska
and be a blubber-ball for
a bunch of trained seals?

223
00:15:39,705 --> 00:15:43,971
Go ahead, I'm
headin' home.
I can't stand in
your way.

224
00:15:44,043 --> 00:15:47,342
If that's the way you feel,
that's the way you feel.

225
00:15:47,413 --> 00:15:49,381
That's the way
I feel about it.

226
00:15:49,448 --> 00:15:52,713
Don't start tellin' my fortune.
It won't do you any good.

227
00:15:54,186 --> 00:15:56,746
What do you think of this?
A black nine on a red jack.

228
00:15:56,822 --> 00:16:00,451
You use those cards to trick me
in every crooked deal we had.

229
00:16:00,526 --> 00:16:04,963
No more, I'm too smart.
You're wastin' you're time,
DukeJohnson.

230
00:16:05,030 --> 00:16:08,124
I'm goin' right back
where I-- What is it?

231
00:16:08,200 --> 00:16:11,192
What's it say?
It's nothing.

232
00:16:11,270 --> 00:16:14,000
You can say that again.
I know those cards.

233
00:16:14,073 --> 00:16:17,839
This is amazing!
They're as phony as you are.
It's lucky I'm smart--

234
00:16:17,910 --> 00:16:22,745
What is it?
What do you see?
You're not interested.

235
00:16:22,815 --> 00:16:25,807
It's a partnership?
It's us.
We're back in New York.

236
00:16:25,884 --> 00:16:28,444
New York?
Yes, and we're rich.

237
00:16:28,520 --> 00:16:31,921
We're driving down to 5th Avenue
in a gold-plated carriage.

238
00:16:31,991 --> 00:16:34,551
5th Avenue?
Yeah, we're sittin' there
smoking dollar cigars...

239
00:16:34,626 --> 00:16:36,958
and we're throwing $50 bills
at the round haircuts.

240
00:16:37,029 --> 00:16:39,554
5th Avenue?
We just turned
down 42nd Street.

241
00:16:39,631 --> 00:16:41,690
Wait'll I get back
in the carriage.

242
00:16:41,767 --> 00:16:44,133
Where you been?
You don't want that crowd
to get all that dough?

243
00:16:44,203 --> 00:16:46,467
Let them have it.
We've got billions.

244
00:16:46,538 --> 00:16:49,701
Where'd
we get it?
Utopia.

245
00:16:49,775 --> 00:16:54,405
Alaska? Pretty smart.
Gave me a fast shuffle, huh?

246
00:16:54,480 --> 00:16:57,779
You'd better face it.
The cards say Alaska.

247
00:16:57,850 --> 00:16:59,841
No wonder,
it's a cold deck.

248
00:17:02,654 --> 00:17:07,853
This seems to be a scene
they put in after I saw
the picture in the studio.

249
00:17:07,926 --> 00:17:11,885
Obviously a lot of extras--
I don't know.

250
00:17:11,964 --> 00:17:15,627
Read all about it.
''Van Hoyden Murderers
Still at Large. ''

251
00:17:15,701 --> 00:17:17,669
Extra paper.
Read all about it.

252
00:17:17,736 --> 00:17:19,670
Extra paper.

253
00:17:19,738 --> 00:17:21,672
Police Anticipate
an Early Arrest.

254
00:17:21,740 --> 00:17:24,834
Van Hoyden's Murderers
Still at Large. Extra.

255
00:17:24,910 --> 00:17:28,107
Hey, boy!
See what happened
to Happy Hooligan.

256
00:17:28,180 --> 00:17:32,708
Careful, don't get hurt.
You'll snap off a thumb.

257
00:17:32,785 --> 00:17:38,121
Keep it.
Well, Chester, looks like
the end of the line for you and I.

258
00:17:38,190 --> 00:17:41,353
There goes Chester and
there goes little old Duke.

259
00:17:41,427 --> 00:17:44,521
That's pretty heavy carfare.
How're you gonna make it?

260
00:17:44,596 --> 00:17:47,326
I'll get along somehow.
Don't worry about me.

261
00:17:47,399 --> 00:17:50,527
Well, Duke,
I guess this is it.

262
00:17:50,602 --> 00:17:52,832
I never thought
we'd end this way.

263
00:17:52,905 --> 00:17:56,033
It's so different.
I'm holdin' the dough
and you're holdin' the bag.

264
00:17:56,108 --> 00:17:58,042
I never thought
I'd have the biggest end.

265
00:17:58,110 --> 00:18:00,738
You've always had
much the biggest end.

266
00:18:00,813 --> 00:18:04,271
Where do you keep your butter?
It was great while it lasted.

267
00:18:04,349 --> 00:18:08,308
What a combo.
Lot of laughs.
Lot of snickers.

268
00:18:08,387 --> 00:18:12,448
We had a couple of things
that money couldn't buy.
I usually got the ugly one.

269
00:18:12,524 --> 00:18:14,890
No hard feelings.
No hard
feelings at all.

270
00:18:14,960 --> 00:18:17,190
So long.
So long.

271
00:18:17,262 --> 00:18:19,457
Well, see ya.

272
00:18:19,531 --> 00:18:21,590
Chester?

273
00:18:21,667 --> 00:18:23,862
Huh?

274
00:18:25,904 --> 00:18:29,340
I can't let you go like this.
Not without letting you know...

275
00:18:29,408 --> 00:18:32,673
whatever happens,
you can always count on me.

276
00:18:32,744 --> 00:18:34,974
That's fine, Duke,
just fine.

277
00:18:35,047 --> 00:18:38,073
I want you to feel that
whatever I have is yours.

278
00:18:38,150 --> 00:18:42,280
Somehow I feel that
whatever you have is mine.

279
00:18:42,354 --> 00:18:47,155
Duke, that little speech
touched me. We're pals.

280
00:18:47,226 --> 00:18:49,956
If we want something,
we don't have to ask for it.

281
00:18:50,028 --> 00:18:53,191
We know it's there
and we take it.

282
00:18:53,265 --> 00:18:58,726
This is it, son. Let me
have one last look at you.

283
00:18:58,804 --> 00:19:04,174
Duke--
Don't speak. Don't say it.
Go quickly and don't look back.

284
00:19:15,621 --> 00:19:18,112
So long, Duke!

285
00:19:18,190 --> 00:19:20,920
Good-bye, Chester.
No hard feelings.

286
00:19:20,993 --> 00:19:24,656
I forgive you for everything;
Hilda, Mabel, the whole works.

287
00:19:24,730 --> 00:19:27,858
Even for trying
to pick my pocket just now.

288
00:19:30,903 --> 00:19:34,361
Why, you dirty rogue!
Wait a minute there!

289
00:19:38,143 --> 00:19:40,373
Emergency!
Look out!

290
00:19:40,445 --> 00:19:43,005
I gotta catch a boat!
Look out!

291
00:19:51,657 --> 00:19:54,319
Out of my way!
Out of my way!

292
00:19:54,393 --> 00:19:56,691
Whoops!
Out of your way.

293
00:19:56,762 --> 00:20:00,095
Spread out boys, you're liable
to get blood all over you.

294
00:20:00,165 --> 00:20:02,599
Chester, whatever seems
to be the trouble?

295
00:20:02,668 --> 00:20:04,602
''Trouble,'' he says?
''Don't look back,'' he says?

296
00:20:04,670 --> 00:20:08,470
I oughta--
Chester, don't fight this thing.
It's too big for you.

297
00:20:08,540 --> 00:20:11,236
Like it says in the cards,
you're on your way to Alaska.
Huh?

298
00:20:14,413 --> 00:20:16,779
Alaska?
I'm goin' to New York!

299
00:20:16,848 --> 00:20:20,045
Stop the boat!
Wait!

300
00:20:21,520 --> 00:20:23,488
What's goin'
on here?

301
00:20:23,555 --> 00:20:25,580
Alaska!
We're goin' to Alaska!

302
00:20:25,657 --> 00:20:27,852
He's gone, this boy--
The gold and everything,

303
00:20:27,926 --> 00:20:30,588
Don't listen to
that cheap phony.
I'm perfectly sane.

304
00:20:30,662 --> 00:20:33,631
Would a sane man go to Alaska
in a Palm Beach suit?

305
00:20:33,699 --> 00:20:37,066
I'm goin' to Brooklyn
to open a Turkish bath--
See what I mean?

306
00:20:37,135 --> 00:20:40,070
Take him to my cabin.
I've handled him before.

307
00:20:40,138 --> 00:20:42,936
I don't want to go to Alaska.
It's cold there!

308
00:20:43,008 --> 00:20:45,135
Icicles, popsicles,
Eskimo pies!

309
00:20:45,210 --> 00:20:48,008
Take your hands off me.
Look, I'm sane.

310
00:20:48,080 --> 00:20:51,049
2 and 2 is 4.
4 and 4 is 8.
8 and 8 is--

311
00:20:51,116 --> 00:20:53,209
[ Duke ]
Ahh.! Ahh.!

312
00:20:53,285 --> 00:20:55,981
Take me below.
He's gone.
We've lost this boy.

313
00:20:56,054 --> 00:20:58,955
You wouldn't do this
if I was in shape.

314
00:20:59,024 --> 00:21:02,050
You need any help,
just call us.
Stand by with a light mallet.

315
00:21:02,127 --> 00:21:04,220
Me on a boat to Alaska?
Maybe I am crazy.

316
00:21:04,296 --> 00:21:06,890
Chester--
Don't give me any talk,
just give me my money.

317
00:21:06,965 --> 00:21:09,525
Don't you think it would be better
if you let me hold the money?

318
00:21:09,601 --> 00:21:11,569
Give me that cabbage
before I part your derby.

319
00:21:11,637 --> 00:21:14,162
If that's the
way you feel--
That's the
way I feel.

320
00:21:14,239 --> 00:21:17,367
Is it all here?
Count it.
We gotta be careful.

321
00:21:17,442 --> 00:21:21,401
This is a strange boat.
There's a lot of crooks around.
You won't be lonesome.

322
00:21:21,480 --> 00:21:24,916
You know way down underneath
I'm honest.
But on top,
you're a rat.

323
00:21:24,983 --> 00:21:28,111
That money would be
safer in my pocket.
You kiddin'?

324
00:21:28,186 --> 00:21:32,316
We're not putting the money
in your pocket or my pocket,

325
00:21:32,391 --> 00:21:37,454
we're puttin' it where
it belongs... in the safe.

326
00:21:37,529 --> 00:21:39,292
See?

327
00:21:39,364 --> 00:21:42,856
Man overboard!
Wait!

328
00:21:50,042 --> 00:21:52,977
No hard feelings?
No hard feelings.

329
00:21:53,045 --> 00:21:56,139
It's only money.
Has no
personality.

330
00:22:06,124 --> 00:22:09,992
You and those cards.
I can't understand.
Must've been a Pinochle deck.

331
00:22:10,062 --> 00:22:12,622
Keep scrubbin'!
Make it shine!

332
00:22:12,698 --> 00:22:15,132
Are you kiddin'?
My fingernails are all gone.

333
00:22:15,200 --> 00:22:17,532
For the last hour I've been
using up the white meat.

334
00:22:17,602 --> 00:22:19,832
You'll keep on 'til you
work you way back to Frisco!

335
00:22:19,905 --> 00:22:23,898
Not me! I've had enough!
Me, too! Who do you think
you're pushin' around?

336
00:22:23,975 --> 00:22:26,000
We're not cattle,
you know!

337
00:22:26,078 --> 00:22:29,946
Moo!
Moo!

338
00:22:37,122 --> 00:22:39,420
Thanks.

339
00:22:41,793 --> 00:22:46,196
Baked ham around here.
Silly place
to get a hotfoot.

340
00:22:46,264 --> 00:22:49,097
Come on, help yourself.
This is no sailboat.

341
00:22:49,167 --> 00:22:52,136
I'm doing my share.
You look like an agent
standing there.

342
00:22:52,204 --> 00:22:55,196
That fire's important.
Makes the boat go.
That's right.

343
00:22:55,273 --> 00:22:57,241
Supposing
it goes out?
Supposing it does?

344
00:22:57,309 --> 00:23:00,437
I'm ready.
Oh, that's--

345
00:23:00,512 --> 00:23:03,675
Pardon me.
Thanks.

346
00:23:03,749 --> 00:23:06,217
What do you do
around here?
Nothing.

347
00:23:06,284 --> 00:23:08,844
You in this picture?
No, taking a short
cut to Stage 1 0.

348
00:23:31,843 --> 00:23:35,609
Very fine, Tony.
All right, who's next?

349
00:23:35,680 --> 00:23:39,582
Let's go, Dad. You're on.
I'm not following
monkeys this season.

350
00:23:39,651 --> 00:23:41,915
They'll think it's an encore.
Besides, 1 0 bucks is 1 0 bucks.

351
00:23:41,987 --> 00:23:45,286
Don't be bashful.
Who's next?
Here's your boy.

352
00:23:45,357 --> 00:23:49,123
Stay in there.
Can I borrow that
Stomach Steinway?

353
00:23:49,194 --> 00:23:51,662
Take good care of him.
You kiddin'?
It's got asthma now.

354
00:23:53,899 --> 00:24:03,570
##

355
00:24:03,642 --> 00:24:07,601
#You think that money
is everything #

356
00:24:07,679 --> 00:24:10,842
#And yet it's
anybody's spring #

357
00:24:10,916 --> 00:24:15,182
# Go make a fortune
become a king #

358
00:24:15,253 --> 00:24:19,519
#And still it's
anybody's spring #

359
00:24:19,591 --> 00:24:22,890
#And if you
flash a bankroll #

360
00:24:22,961 --> 00:24:25,486
# Do you suppose
the brook would care #

361
00:24:25,564 --> 00:24:28,795
# Or that a rose would say #

362
00:24:28,867 --> 00:24:32,530
# ''There goes a millionaire'' #

363
00:24:33,772 --> 00:24:38,004
# It's more than diamonds
around a ring #

364
00:24:38,076 --> 00:24:41,637
# Because it's
anybody's spring #

365
00:24:41,713 --> 00:24:45,649
#You may be born with
the silver spoon #

366
00:24:45,717 --> 00:24:49,847
#And yet it's
anybody's moon #

367
00:24:49,921 --> 00:24:53,152
#You couldn't buy a ticket #

368
00:24:53,225 --> 00:24:56,854
#To hear the first robin sing #

369
00:24:56,928 --> 00:25:02,423
# It's free because it's
anybody's spring #

370
00:25:02,501 --> 00:25:13,070
##

371
00:25:13,144 --> 00:25:17,581
I never knew I could play
one of these.
You could
beat the monkey.

372
00:25:20,552 --> 00:25:23,851
#You couldn't
buy a ticket #

373
00:25:23,922 --> 00:25:27,449
#To hear the
first robin sing #

374
00:25:27,526 --> 00:25:33,260
# It's free because it's
anybody's spring ##

375
00:25:38,270 --> 00:25:40,500
Very nice.
Very nice.

376
00:25:40,572 --> 00:25:42,836
Now for the winner.
Line up here, please.

377
00:25:42,908 --> 00:25:45,638
He's wasting time.
Naturally.

378
00:26:02,594 --> 00:26:05,324
Next time,
I bring Sinatra.

379
00:26:22,714 --> 00:26:27,117
Could you tell me where
I could find a Mr. Ace Larson?

380
00:26:27,185 --> 00:26:29,119
At his place,
I reckon--

381
00:26:29,187 --> 00:26:32,213
The Golden Rail.
Thank you.

382
00:26:38,496 --> 00:26:41,226
So I came up here as fast
as I could, Mr. Larson.

383
00:26:41,299 --> 00:26:44,962
If you'll only help me,
I'll be glad to pay you--
Pay me?

384
00:26:45,036 --> 00:26:49,666
You seem to forget, my dear,
your father was my best friend.
Thank you.

385
00:26:49,741 --> 00:26:52,266
Who did you say
stole that map?

386
00:26:52,344 --> 00:26:55,279
I didn't, but they were seen--
Two men, Sperry and McGurk.

387
00:26:55,347 --> 00:26:58,908
Sperry and McGurk, huh?

388
00:26:58,984 --> 00:27:01,646
You know them?
By reputation only.

389
00:27:01,720 --> 00:27:04,780
Two of the blackest
cutthroats that ever
dirtied up the Klondike.

390
00:27:04,856 --> 00:27:07,757
- Maybe the police--
- That won't be necessary.

391
00:27:07,826 --> 00:27:10,727
Go down to the dock.
I want to know the minute
those two hit town.

392
00:27:12,597 --> 00:27:17,227
I can't begin to
thank you, Mr. Larson.
Forget it.

393
00:27:17,302 --> 00:27:19,395
What do you do?

394
00:27:19,471 --> 00:27:23,635
I beg your pardon?
For your living.
How do you get by?

395
00:27:23,708 --> 00:27:25,903
I sing a little.

396
00:27:27,445 --> 00:27:29,709
I like that.

397
00:27:29,781 --> 00:27:31,806
From now on,
you'll work for me.

398
00:27:33,118 --> 00:27:35,746
Now don't you worry your
pretty little head about it.

399
00:27:35,820 --> 00:27:38,846
Just leave everything to me.
You've been
terribly sweet.

400
00:27:38,923 --> 00:27:43,656
The dirty dog. He just
wants to get Dorothy into
one of those scanty costumes.

401
00:27:43,728 --> 00:27:45,423
Not a
bad idea.

402
00:27:45,497 --> 00:27:49,297
I'm working
for Mr. Larson--
Upstairs.

403
00:27:49,367 --> 00:27:51,597
Thank you.

404
00:27:57,542 --> 00:27:59,237
Who's the
fancy baggage?

405
00:27:59,310 --> 00:28:01,608
A little lady who's
lost a gold mine.

406
00:28:01,680 --> 00:28:06,174
Are you the lost and found
department?
I'm gonna help
her get it back.

407
00:28:06,251 --> 00:28:10,187
Aren't you stepping
a little out of character?
I don't know.

408
00:28:10,255 --> 00:28:12,689
The mine's worth about
three million dollars.

409
00:28:12,757 --> 00:28:17,091
What do we get
out of it?
About three
million dollars.

410
00:28:20,331 --> 00:28:23,266
Doesn't leave the
''little lady'' much, does it?

411
00:28:23,334 --> 00:28:27,703
That's what I like about you.
You're good at arithmetic.

412
00:28:30,241 --> 00:28:34,268
The boat docks in Skagway
but are we getting off?

413
00:28:34,345 --> 00:28:38,372
Oh, no, we're cooked.
I didn't want
to get on this boat.

414
00:28:38,450 --> 00:28:41,476
I was Shangri-La'd.
Shanghaied,
old man.

415
00:28:41,553 --> 00:28:43,487
Well, one of those
towns in Egypt.

416
00:28:49,861 --> 00:28:52,455
What do you
got there?

417
00:28:52,530 --> 00:28:55,294
Just an old piece of paper,
that's all.

418
00:28:55,366 --> 00:28:57,834
What're you puttin' it
in your pocket for?

419
00:28:57,902 --> 00:29:00,496
I save old paper.
Some people save old string.

420
00:29:00,572 --> 00:29:02,733
I think folding
is more fun than twisting.

421
00:29:02,807 --> 00:29:06,106
What is it?
Just a map
of an old gold mine.

422
00:29:06,177 --> 00:29:09,169
What?
Just a little one. Good for
a couple of inlays maybe.

423
00:29:09,247 --> 00:29:11,681
Let's see it.
I'm an old map man.

424
00:29:11,750 --> 00:29:13,809
It's my
type of work.

425
00:29:16,121 --> 00:29:20,023
Chester, you realize
what this is?
It's a map.

426
00:29:20,091 --> 00:29:23,891
It's the Van Hoyden gold mine.
You read the papers.
You think so?

427
00:29:23,962 --> 00:29:26,760
The guys that have this room
must be the killers.
Dirty rats.

428
00:29:26,831 --> 00:29:29,493
[ Duke ]
We got the map. It's ours.
How do you figure?

429
00:29:29,567 --> 00:29:32,695
The law of the Yukon--
Possession.
How 'bout the murderers?

430
00:29:32,771 --> 00:29:34,932
We'll turn them
over to the cops.

431
00:29:35,006 --> 00:29:38,635
- They should be boiled in oil.
- I told you... a gold mine.!

432
00:29:38,710 --> 00:29:41,474
I saw it in the cards.
Those beautiful cards.

433
00:29:41,546 --> 00:29:44,538
Riding down 5th Avenue.
Throwing 50-dollar bills
at the round haircuts.

434
00:29:44,616 --> 00:29:48,052
We'll be
living like kings.
Living like kings?

435
00:29:48,119 --> 00:29:50,019
I abdicate.

436
00:29:50,088 --> 00:29:53,023
Nice little mine
you got here, fellas.

437
00:29:53,091 --> 00:29:56,492
Wear it in
good health, boys.
Nice to meet you.

438
00:29:56,561 --> 00:29:59,359
Come on, Chester.
We got a little dust
of our own to take care of.

439
00:29:59,430 --> 00:30:02,399
Start cleaning up here.
That blood.

440
00:30:02,467 --> 00:30:04,867
There's no
blood there.
There's gonna be.

441
00:30:04,936 --> 00:30:06,801
No noise.
You wanna wake up
the neighborhood?

442
00:30:06,871 --> 00:30:09,396
This is much better.

443
00:30:09,474 --> 00:30:12,341
Yeah? I ain't
afraid to die.

444
00:30:12,410 --> 00:30:15,038
I just hate
being killed.

445
00:30:16,481 --> 00:30:19,712
Wait a minute.
Think it over.
For a couple of years.

446
00:30:19,784 --> 00:30:23,880
You wouldn't want to dirty
a nice knife over a stale
couple of million bucks.!

447
00:30:23,955 --> 00:30:26,014
What do we do now?
Remember Schenectady?

448
00:30:27,225 --> 00:30:29,921
Okay fellas,
we're ready.

449
00:30:29,994 --> 00:30:32,827
We ain't askin'
for no mercy.
Can we say
our prayers?

450
00:30:32,897 --> 00:30:36,060
Okay.
Be quick about it.

451
00:30:45,310 --> 00:30:48,677
Bailey...
Crawford.
Bailey...
Crawford.

452
00:30:48,746 --> 00:30:51,442
No trace of those
stowaways, sir.
I ain't worried.

453
00:30:51,516 --> 00:30:54,076
If they're gettin' off, they've
got to come through here.

454
00:30:54,152 --> 00:30:56,086
Flannery.
Flannery.

455
00:30:56,154 --> 00:30:58,179
peters.
peters.

456
00:31:21,312 --> 00:31:23,246
Lombardi.
Lombardi.

457
00:31:23,314 --> 00:31:25,248
Sperry.
And McGurk.

458
00:31:25,316 --> 00:31:27,648
Sperry and McGurk.
Sperry and McGurk?

459
00:31:30,688 --> 00:31:35,557
Yeah, Sperry and McGurk.
What about it, partner?
What about it?

460
00:31:35,627 --> 00:31:38,619
Nothing, boys. Only,
just don't make any trouble.

461
00:31:38,696 --> 00:31:41,631
Things are different
since you boys were here.
It's nice and peaceful.

462
00:31:41,699 --> 00:31:45,191
Don't worry, we're
law-abiding citizens now.

463
00:31:45,270 --> 00:31:47,670
Anybody says we ain't,
we'll plug 'em.

464
00:31:55,179 --> 00:31:58,876
Hey, Sperry and McGurk
just hit town.

465
00:31:58,950 --> 00:32:01,885
Sperry and McGurk?
Yeah, and they're
headed this way.

466
00:32:01,953 --> 00:32:04,080
Here they
come now!

467
00:32:22,206 --> 00:32:24,401
What goes with
the local peasantry?

468
00:32:24,475 --> 00:32:26,705
One look at us and they
run right out of the joint.

469
00:32:26,778 --> 00:32:28,939
I feel like I'm
back in vaudeville.

470
00:32:29,013 --> 00:32:31,504
I don't know what Sperry
and McGurk did to this burg,

471
00:32:31,582 --> 00:32:34,608
but they're dynamite.
We own this town.

472
00:32:34,686 --> 00:32:37,086
I'll sell cheap.
I don't like it.

473
00:32:37,155 --> 00:32:39,089
If those hoodlums ever
get off that boat,

474
00:32:39,157 --> 00:32:41,387
we'll be smiling from ear
to ear with our throats.
Forget it.

475
00:32:41,459 --> 00:32:45,418
The town's ours-- Food,
liquor, supplies, anything.
All we got to do is act tough.

476
00:32:45,496 --> 00:32:49,432
Tough?
Remember, you're Sperry
and I'm McGurk.

477
00:32:49,500 --> 00:32:52,367
Got it?
Got it.

478
00:32:52,437 --> 00:32:56,771
Made it.
Not quite.
It's a leaner.

479
00:32:56,841 --> 00:33:01,335
What'd I tell ya?
We got the royal suite,
dinner, liquor,

480
00:33:01,412 --> 00:33:04,176
sled loaded with
a month's supplies.

481
00:33:04,248 --> 00:33:08,446
Hasn't cost us a dime.
Clamber out of that beaver.

482
00:33:08,519 --> 00:33:10,817
How'll they know we're
Sperry and McGurk?
We'll tell 'em.

483
00:33:10,888 --> 00:33:13,220
If those two butchers
ever get off that boat,

484
00:33:13,291 --> 00:33:15,259
we'll wind up hamburger,
blood-rare.

485
00:33:15,326 --> 00:33:17,260
I don't like it.
You don't like it?

486
00:33:17,328 --> 00:33:19,387
You don't know a good thing
when you see it.

487
00:33:19,464 --> 00:33:22,331
This town's a whole
big jackpot for us.
I don't like it.

488
00:33:22,400 --> 00:33:24,868
Skagway Sal wants
to see you boys.

489
00:33:24,936 --> 00:33:28,030
I'm beginning
to like it.
Get out of here!

490
00:33:28,106 --> 00:33:30,006
We got business.
Who'd you say?

491
00:33:30,074 --> 00:33:32,201
Skagway Sal.

492
00:33:32,276 --> 00:33:34,938
Well, come on in.
That's our business.

493
00:33:35,013 --> 00:33:38,312
Where does, uh--
hang out?
Golden Rail.

494
00:33:38,383 --> 00:33:40,408
Looky here,
Skunky.

495
00:33:40,485 --> 00:33:43,579
Anybody ever see Sperry and
McGurk with their beards off?

496
00:33:43,654 --> 00:33:45,588
Not that I know of.

497
00:33:45,656 --> 00:33:49,387
Spread the news around.
They're gonna see it tonight.
Okay.

498
00:33:59,137 --> 00:34:01,571
Skagway Sal, let's go.
Now they're furnishing dates.

499
00:34:01,639 --> 00:34:04,608
This is a great town.
We're beginning to operate.

500
00:34:04,675 --> 00:34:08,509
Sal's waitin'.
What's the rush?
There's only one dame.

501
00:34:08,579 --> 00:34:11,912
You better clamber out of
that mattress before somebody
asks you for a cough drop.

502
00:34:11,983 --> 00:34:15,077
You better let
me hold the map.
What for?

503
00:34:15,153 --> 00:34:17,178
You know how you act when
you get around women.

504
00:34:17,255 --> 00:34:19,223
The only thing I do is
get ''around'' the women.

505
00:34:19,290 --> 00:34:21,622
Give me the map.
Don't forget,
half s mine.

506
00:34:21,692 --> 00:34:24,252
Half of it's yours.
Here you are.

507
00:34:24,328 --> 00:34:27,729
What're you doing?
Putting mine in my
hat in a safe place.

508
00:34:27,799 --> 00:34:30,666
You'd better do
the same thing.
In a safe
place, huh?

509
00:34:30,735 --> 00:34:34,262
What do you think
of my underwear?
Not much,
but put it there.

510
00:34:38,843 --> 00:34:42,472
Throw that
candy away.
I got a sweet tooth.

511
00:34:42,547 --> 00:34:46,608
We're supposed to be killers...
supposed to look tough.
The almonds are tough.

512
00:34:46,684 --> 00:34:49,482
Lose it.
Throw it away.
Stash it.

513
00:34:49,554 --> 00:34:54,082
Here, Fuzzy.
Dessert? Come on.

514
00:34:54,158 --> 00:34:56,683
When you get to an elbow,
it's mine.
Are you crazy?

515
00:34:56,761 --> 00:34:59,286
Feedin' a loose pooch?
We'll never get rid of him.

516
00:34:59,363 --> 00:35:02,161
He's a cute character.
Let's take him along.
He's as big as a horse.

517
00:35:02,233 --> 00:35:05,202
Probably eats like a horse.
That runs into a lot of money.

518
00:35:05,269 --> 00:35:08,170
You oughta know.
Come on.

519
00:35:08,239 --> 00:35:10,434
Remember, we're supposed
to be Sperry and McGurk.

520
00:35:10,508 --> 00:35:12,703
Tough, huh?
Very tough.

521
00:35:12,777 --> 00:35:15,007
Scat, sad sack.
Go on, scat.

522
00:35:15,079 --> 00:35:17,445
Beat it before he
throws a saddle on you.

523
00:35:45,009 --> 00:35:47,307
There they are!

524
00:35:52,583 --> 00:35:54,847
How tough could
these guys have been?

525
00:36:03,194 --> 00:36:05,958
Okay, everybody, go ahead
and enjoy yourselves.

526
00:36:06,030 --> 00:36:08,726
We ain't in
a killin' mood tonight.

527
00:36:11,602 --> 00:36:14,036
Just
a woundin' mood.

528
00:36:14,105 --> 00:36:17,871
Let's get some action here.
We're springin' tonight.

529
00:36:17,942 --> 00:36:22,106
Champagne
for the crowd.

530
00:36:25,416 --> 00:36:28,749
That's enough.
We're the crowd.

531
00:36:32,223 --> 00:36:36,922
At this point the plot is
much more interesting from
your point of view than mine.

532
00:36:51,876 --> 00:36:55,039
This is the life,
Pappy.
This is awful.

533
00:36:55,112 --> 00:36:57,706
What's the matter?
I ain't got
room for her.

534
00:36:57,782 --> 00:37:01,309
I wish I had another leg.
What happens when Sal shows up?

535
00:37:01,385 --> 00:37:04,786
She'll have to sign
an application blank.
We may get to her later.

536
00:37:08,993 --> 00:37:13,225

Well, duty calls.
I'll see you later.
What do you mean?

565
00:38:56,534 --> 00:38:59,503
You saw her makin' with those eyes,
givin' me that come hither.

566
00:38:59,570 --> 00:39:01,265
Givin' you that
come hither?
Yes.

567
00:39:01,339 --> 00:39:03,170
Where
you goin'?
Thither.

568
00:39:03,240 --> 00:39:06,641
You're not ''nither.'' She was
giving me the same business.

569
00:39:06,711 --> 00:39:09,874
This gal's been around.
Takes a lad like me to handle her.
Like you?

570
00:39:09,947 --> 00:39:12,609
Experience is
the best teacher.
The best teacher?

571
00:39:12,683 --> 00:39:16,050
And I'm a PhD.
That's Pinheaded Dope.
Einstein--

572
00:39:16,120 --> 00:39:18,145
Here comes the waiter
with the check.

573
00:39:18,222 --> 00:39:20,486
Which one of you
two fellas is Sperry?

574
00:39:27,965 --> 00:39:31,992
Experience is the
best teacher, huh?

575
00:39:32,069 --> 00:39:35,163
Don't wait up for me.
I may have to stay after school.

576
00:39:38,342 --> 00:39:40,674
That poor little lamb.

577
00:39:40,745 --> 00:39:42,838
All right, girls,
everybody back!

578
00:39:42,913 --> 00:39:47,509
Work fast. As soon as we
get the map, Ace is headin'
for his place up at Dawson.

579
00:39:47,585 --> 00:39:51,248
You sure they're the right men?
They don't look like killers.

580
00:39:51,322 --> 00:39:54,553
We're going to
a lot of trouble on this.
Don't make it tougher.

581
00:39:54,625 --> 00:39:57,321
I appreciate--

582
00:39:57,395 --> 00:40:01,331
You wanna get your mine,
don't you? Leave it to Ace.

583
00:40:01,399 --> 00:40:03,629
He told you
to get that map.

584
00:40:03,701 --> 00:40:06,135
He ain't particular
how you get it.

585
00:40:09,407 --> 00:40:11,307
Come in.

586
00:40:14,545 --> 00:40:17,343
Well, here I am.
Start burning the incense.

587
00:40:17,415 --> 00:40:19,110
Come in.

588
00:40:22,253 --> 00:40:27,020
Well,
here we are.
Yes,
here we are.

589
00:40:27,091 --> 00:40:30,822
Well?
Well?

590
00:40:30,895 --> 00:40:32,920
Care to shoot
a game of pool?

591
00:40:32,997 --> 00:40:36,933
I'm glad I waited, Sperry.
Everything they said
about you is true.

592
00:40:37,001 --> 00:40:40,493
I can only love a killer
and you've got ''killer''
written all over you.

593
00:40:40,571 --> 00:40:44,974
Those shifty eyes,
that weak chin--
Camouflage.

594
00:40:45,042 --> 00:40:47,510
How many men have
you killed this week?

595
00:40:47,578 --> 00:40:50,479
Just 40 or 50. I've been
in a pretty good mood.

596
00:40:50,548 --> 00:40:54,143
Let's not talk shop.
It seems to me
we've met somewhere before.

597
00:40:54,218 --> 00:40:57,449
I don't think so.
Perhaps
in your dreams.

598
00:40:57,521 --> 00:40:59,512
You wouldn't be seen
in those kind of places.

599
00:40:59,590 --> 00:41:04,994
Some women can love
any type of man, but not me.
I've got to have a beast.

600
00:41:05,062 --> 00:41:08,225
Is a wolf
considered a beast?

601
00:41:08,299 --> 00:41:10,460
My, what
a fiery nature.

602
00:41:10,534 --> 00:41:13,002
Let's throw
another log on it.

603
00:41:16,073 --> 00:41:19,668
As far as I'm concerned,
this picture's over right now.

604
00:41:19,743 --> 00:41:23,304
Oh, Sperry!
Never leave me,
Sal, you'll suffer.

605
00:41:23,380 --> 00:41:25,610
Not for anything
in the world.

606
00:41:25,683 --> 00:41:28,880
Not even if they
offered me... a gold mine.

607
00:41:28,953 --> 00:41:31,046
Gold mine?

608
00:41:31,121 --> 00:41:36,184
Money doesn't matter to me.
I don't care how poor you are.

609
00:41:36,260 --> 00:41:38,285
You mean that,
don't you?

610
00:41:38,362 --> 00:41:40,489
You've got nothing
to worry about.

611
00:41:45,769 --> 00:41:47,760
Shh!
I'm loaded.

612
00:41:47,838 --> 00:41:50,398
Loaded?
Gold mine
with nuggets.

613
00:41:50,474 --> 00:41:52,669
Sperry,
don't be facetious.

614
00:41:52,743 --> 00:41:55,678
Keep politics out of this.
I have the biggest
gold mine in Alaska.

615
00:41:55,746 --> 00:41:57,839
It's ours...
yours and mine.

616
00:41:57,915 --> 00:42:01,180
What about your partner?
Porky?
Just a stooge.

617
00:42:01,252 --> 00:42:04,244
Once we get that map off
of him, we're rollin'.

618
00:42:04,321 --> 00:42:06,983
He's got the map?
Don't worry. I'll get
it when he's asleep.

619
00:42:07,057 --> 00:42:10,493
Where does he keep it?
Sorry, we don't tell anyone,
we're no fools.

620
00:42:10,561 --> 00:42:13,587
Not even me?
Not even you.

621
00:42:13,664 --> 00:42:17,862
I hope it's in a safe place.
Who'd ever think of
looking in his hat?

622
00:42:17,935 --> 00:42:20,961
We're not amateurs,
you know.
I can see that.

623
00:42:21,038 --> 00:42:23,836
It's getting late,
you'd better run along.

624
00:42:23,908 --> 00:42:26,706
What's the rush?
I've got another
show to do.

625
00:42:26,777 --> 00:42:29,507
But I just
got here.
I said, later.

626
00:42:29,580 --> 00:42:32,174
Midnight,
my apartment?

627
00:42:32,249 --> 00:42:35,412
Supper?
I'm not hungry.

628
00:42:42,226 --> 00:42:44,160
I'll go work up
an appetite.

629
00:42:56,740 --> 00:42:59,265
Come in.

630
00:43:00,778 --> 00:43:03,804
You can take the lantern
out of the window, Sal gal.

631
00:43:03,881 --> 00:43:06,679
The mighty McGurk is home.
Sit down.
Make yourself cozy.

632
00:43:06,750 --> 00:43:09,685
I don't mind
if I do.

633
00:43:10,721 --> 00:43:14,179
Well, this is
more like it.

634
00:43:14,258 --> 00:43:18,786
Seems like they sent you
the wrong boy.
I asked
for McGurk.

635
00:43:18,862 --> 00:43:21,558
You must've
spelled it with a ''J''.

636
00:43:21,632 --> 00:43:25,033
I knew you'd come to
your senses sooner or later.

637
00:43:25,102 --> 00:43:28,094
They all do.
It's not hard
to understand.

638
00:43:28,172 --> 00:43:31,573
Where're
you goin'?
Cigarette.

639
00:43:31,642 --> 00:43:34,338
You've got one.
I have,
haven't I?

640
00:43:34,411 --> 00:43:38,074
I guess I'm a little mixed up.
See what you do to me?

641
00:43:38,148 --> 00:43:41,379
You can't help yourself, babe.
You just joined the club.

642
00:43:41,452 --> 00:43:44,046
Must have quite
a membership.
Coast to coast.

643
00:43:44,121 --> 00:43:47,113
We can always squeeze
in a new member.

644
00:43:47,191 --> 00:43:48,488
You're quite a panic with
the ladies, aren't you?

645
00:43:48,559 --> 00:43:51,858
I'm murder when
I make my move.

646
00:43:53,197 --> 00:43:55,062
Tell me,

647
00:43:55,132 --> 00:43:59,000
how do
you do it?

648
00:43:59,069 --> 00:44:04,132
It's the usual routine;
flowers, Sunday dinner
at home with the folks,

649
00:44:04,208 --> 00:44:09,077
a ride in the park,
sing a little song and uh--

650
00:44:09,146 --> 00:44:11,080
Sing a little song.

651
00:44:11,148 --> 00:44:15,244
The song does it?
It sort of limbers
them up a little.

652
00:44:15,319 --> 00:44:17,514
That song may be
just what we need here.

653
00:44:17,588 --> 00:44:21,354
Baby, you and me
don't need no scales.
Come on.

654
00:44:21,425 --> 00:44:23,859
You're not
going anywhere.

655
00:44:25,696 --> 00:44:29,655
There's the piano.
Let's hear you practice
what you preach.

656
00:44:32,469 --> 00:44:38,874
##

657
00:44:38,942 --> 00:44:42,571
#Welcome
to my dream #

658
00:44:42,646 --> 00:44:47,310
#And how are you #

659
00:44:47,384 --> 00:44:50,876
#Will you
be here long #

660
00:44:50,954 --> 00:44:55,084
# Or just
passin' through #

661
00:44:55,159 --> 00:45:00,096
# Brush off
that stardust #

662
00:45:00,164 --> 00:45:02,962
#Where have
you been #

663
00:45:04,368 --> 00:45:08,236
#Don't tell me
your rainbow #

664
00:45:08,305 --> 00:45:12,298
#Was late gettin' in #

665
00:45:14,845 --> 00:45:18,713
#Welcome to my dream #

666
00:45:18,782 --> 00:45:22,149
# It now seems real #

667
00:45:23,654 --> 00:45:27,317
# You're what
it needed #

668
00:45:27,391 --> 00:45:31,293
# To make it ideal #

669
00:45:31,361 --> 00:45:36,162
# So glad you got here #

670
00:45:36,233 --> 00:45:40,260
# I hope you can stay #

671
00:45:41,905 --> 00:45:44,772
# But welcome
to my dream #

672
00:45:44,842 --> 00:45:52,942
#Anyway ##

673
00:46:04,428 --> 00:46:07,693
What's the matter, gal?
Want another chorus?
Later.

674
00:46:07,765 --> 00:46:11,132
Later?
Midnight,
my apartment?

675
00:46:11,201 --> 00:46:13,362
What for?
I'm here now.

676
00:46:13,437 --> 00:46:17,703
A cozy little supper?
I'm not ''hongry.''

677
00:46:19,610 --> 00:46:21,544
I'll go work up
an appetite.

678
00:46:23,514 --> 00:46:26,449
Hope just said
that line, didn't he?

679
00:46:26,517 --> 00:46:29,543
Why should he get
all the laughs?

680
00:46:43,033 --> 00:46:46,628
Here it is.
Nice work, Miss Van Hoyden.
You know what to do.

681
00:46:46,703 --> 00:46:51,003
Keep 'em here in town.
Give me 48 hours. I'll stake out
the claim and bring papers.

682
00:46:51,074 --> 00:46:53,201
I don't know how
to thank you.

683
00:46:53,277 --> 00:46:55,837
Forget it. We're only
too happy to take care of you.

684
00:46:55,913 --> 00:46:58,473
You be careful. You've got
a couple of bad boys there.

685
00:46:58,549 --> 00:47:01,484
I'll handle Mr. Sperry
and Mr. McGurk.

686
00:47:01,552 --> 00:47:04,953
All right,
mush!

687
00:47:07,257 --> 00:47:10,226
So you finally got
yourself a date?
You said it.

688
00:47:10,294 --> 00:47:12,421
You pick up
a lonely walrus?

689
00:47:12,496 --> 00:47:14,464
You know I don't cut
into your territory.

690
00:47:14,531 --> 00:47:17,364
You know that school of
experience? I enrolled.

691
00:47:17,434 --> 00:47:20,835
Tonight I take my
first exam... in cooking.

692
00:47:20,904 --> 00:47:23,600
Never pass. I have
a date with teacher.

693
00:47:23,674 --> 00:47:26,006
That's fine. I like--
What do you mean?

694
00:47:26,076 --> 00:47:28,704
Midnight, supper,
her apartment.

695
00:47:28,779 --> 00:47:32,476
I shall be there.
Doing what, waiting on tables?
That supper's for Chester.

696
00:47:32,549 --> 00:47:35,211
Listen, fatter-than-me,
you're over-matching yourself.

697
00:47:35,285 --> 00:47:38,686
She made the date with me.
Why would she make a date with
two guys at the same time?

698
00:47:38,755 --> 00:47:40,848
Why not?

699
00:47:42,426 --> 00:47:46,385
How about that? This youth
says you made a date with him.

700
00:47:46,463 --> 00:47:49,694
Yes, I did.
You're darn right.

701
00:47:49,766 --> 00:47:52,291
You invited me.
You sellin' tickets?

702
00:47:52,369 --> 00:47:58,205
I like both of you so much,
and Sperry and McGurk always
work together as a team.

703
00:47:58,275 --> 00:48:00,835
Not on everything, we don't.

704
00:48:00,911 --> 00:48:04,210
Let's go downstairs
and talk this over.

705
00:48:06,216 --> 00:48:09,083
Who was it that said,
''Two's company, three's a crowd?

706
00:48:09,152 --> 00:48:11,450
Wasn't he silly?
Yes.
Yes.

707
00:48:11,521 --> 00:48:15,981
I see no reason why
a girl can't have a
good time with two fellas.

708
00:48:16,059 --> 00:48:18,357
As long as one's
her grandfather.

709
00:48:18,428 --> 00:48:20,692
You don't
look that old.

710
00:48:28,205 --> 00:48:30,196
So long, Sal.
Nice knowin' you.

711
00:48:30,274 --> 00:48:32,265
Where you going?
North to cool off.

712
00:48:32,342 --> 00:48:34,708
Don't you have
to have a map?
I got my half.

713
00:48:34,778 --> 00:48:36,712
I got my half.
Half?

714
00:48:36,780 --> 00:48:38,714
I'll see you
when we get back.

715
00:48:38,782 --> 00:48:40,579
Sled's outside.
Let's get our coats and blow.

716
00:48:43,387 --> 00:48:46,845
Where are they?
21 8.

717
00:48:56,300 --> 00:48:58,928
What a blizzard!
We should've put on
some warm clothes.

718
00:48:59,002 --> 00:49:02,665
Hope there's no
bear hunters around.
Mine's still alive.

719
00:49:04,241 --> 00:49:06,801
Where do you step
on the starter?
No starter?

720
00:49:06,877 --> 00:49:09,710
Must be last
year's model.
It's a dog sled!

721
00:49:09,780 --> 00:49:12,772
We'll pull
it ourselves.
Not me!
In a blizzard?

722
00:49:12,849 --> 00:49:14,783
Are you mad?
We're not dogs, you know.

723
00:49:27,998 --> 00:49:31,456
I've got to get a sled.
No dogs till tomorrow.

724
00:49:31,535 --> 00:49:35,801
Will you have any by daybreak?
I've got to get away.

725
00:49:42,813 --> 00:49:46,681
Here we are,
off on another road!
And what a road!

726
00:49:46,750 --> 00:49:49,412
Case those trees,
that snow, that scenery!

727
00:49:49,486 --> 00:49:52,717
And get a load
of that bread and butter.

728
00:49:52,789 --> 00:49:56,190
Bread and butter?
That's a mountain.!

729
00:49:58,495 --> 00:50:02,955
May be a mountain to you,
but it's bread and butter to me.
Well, keep it shady.

730
00:50:05,068 --> 00:50:07,559
I'm in a hurry.
Think you can
handle it?

731
00:50:07,637 --> 00:50:11,596
Handle it!
I was raised up here. Mush!

732
00:50:15,178 --> 00:50:18,079
# I don't care
where I'm going #

733
00:50:18,148 --> 00:50:20,708
#Just as long
as I'm with you #

734
00:50:20,784 --> 00:50:25,380
# Put it there, pal
put it there #

735
00:50:25,455 --> 00:50:29,892
I saw ''Let's Face It.''
And I saw ''Dixie'' too.

736
00:50:29,960 --> 00:50:34,329
# Put it there, pal
put it there #

737
00:50:34,398 --> 00:50:36,798
#This country's
full of wolves #

738
00:50:36,867 --> 00:50:38,892
# But you should make
'em laughingstocks #

739
00:50:38,969 --> 00:50:40,937
#The girls are fond
of blubber #

740
00:50:41,004 --> 00:50:43,302
#And the igloos
have no locks #

741
00:50:43,373 --> 00:50:47,207
#You'll wow the lady Eskimos
They don't wear bobby socks #

742
00:50:47,277 --> 00:50:49,711
#You're so faithful
and so fair #

743
00:50:49,780 --> 00:50:52,112
Hit me with
your biscuit hook.
Coming with some hot skin!

744
00:50:52,182 --> 00:50:56,812
#You've got that something
in your voice so right
for selling cheese #

745
00:50:56,887 --> 00:51:01,517
# Put it there, pal
put it there #

746
00:51:01,591 --> 00:51:03,718
I think your jokes
are great.
Do you?

747
00:51:03,794 --> 00:51:06,160
It's just folks
are hard to please.
Yeah.

748
00:51:06,229 --> 00:51:10,461
Your hand, sir.
Put that back
in the bowl.

749
00:51:10,534 --> 00:51:15,096
#Your face could make
a fortune just your nose
should make a lot #

750
00:51:15,172 --> 00:51:17,106
# I like the way
you wear #

751
00:51:17,174 --> 00:51:19,768
#Those gaudy-colored
shirts you've got #

752
00:51:19,843 --> 00:51:24,041
#The only time a rainbow
ever covered up a pot #

753
00:51:24,114 --> 00:51:26,173
#We make
a perfect pair #

754
00:51:26,249 --> 00:51:28,740
# Put it there #

755
00:51:28,819 --> 00:51:31,083
My colleague.
My cohort.
My crony
my friend.

756
00:51:31,154 --> 00:51:33,315
Companions.
Chums to the end.
Confederates.

757
00:51:33,390 --> 00:51:35,950
Like meat
and potatoes.
Or salt and tomatoes.

758
00:51:36,026 --> 00:51:37,891
# Boy what a blend #

759
00:51:37,961 --> 00:51:42,057
# Don't put it in the paper
Don't put it on the air #

760
00:51:42,132 --> 00:51:45,761
# Don't put it on the shelf
put it there #

761
00:51:59,583 --> 00:52:02,450
Look who's here!
Santa Claus!

762
00:52:02,519 --> 00:52:04,817
Say, there must be
a department store around here.

763
00:52:04,888 --> 00:52:09,450
Well, well!
Chester and Duke.

764
00:52:09,526 --> 00:52:12,290
Whoa!
Ha-ha-ha-ha.

765
00:52:12,362 --> 00:52:14,956
Got your Christmas
presents right here.

766
00:52:15,031 --> 00:52:18,694
On your way, Fatso.
Think we're gonna fall
for that kid stuff?

767
00:52:18,768 --> 00:52:21,635
You mean you don't believe
in Santa Claus?

768
00:52:21,705 --> 00:52:25,141
What do you think we are?
Children? Infants?
Babies?

769
00:52:25,208 --> 00:52:27,972
Very well.
Ha-ha-ha-ha!

770
00:52:28,044 --> 00:52:32,208
I'll just give 'em
to somebody else.

771
00:52:34,317 --> 00:52:37,252
You'll be sorry!

772
00:52:59,676 --> 00:53:03,976
Half a map! I let
two-bit hoodlums cross me up.

773
00:53:04,047 --> 00:53:05,981
I didn't give 'em
much credit.

774
00:53:06,049 --> 00:53:09,212
Maybe our nightingale
is holding out.
That's all she got.

775
00:53:09,286 --> 00:53:12,449
I'll get
the other half--
No, you don't!

776
00:53:12,522 --> 00:53:16,253
I'm not going to tangle
with the Mounties.

777
00:53:16,326 --> 00:53:18,123
Van Hoyden
got half the map.

778
00:53:18,195 --> 00:53:20,857
Let her get the other.
Suppose I go help
her out?

779
00:53:20,931 --> 00:53:23,229
Yeah! I like that.

780
00:53:23,300 --> 00:53:26,929
I don't!
I'm running this show.
You'll both go.

781
00:53:27,003 --> 00:53:30,598
We'll give Kate a chance.
If that doesn't work,
then you take over.

782
00:53:33,910 --> 00:53:35,707
Whoa!

783
00:53:35,779 --> 00:53:38,304
Whoa!

784
00:53:41,318 --> 00:53:43,377
Let's go down
and get them.

785
00:53:43,453 --> 00:53:46,320
You know what Ace said.
We try Kate's way first.

786
00:53:46,389 --> 00:53:49,552
McKenzie's cabin's there.
You understand?

787
00:53:49,626 --> 00:53:53,790
Give me till
tomorrow morning.
We'll be waiting here.

788
00:53:57,867 --> 00:54:00,802
And I was gonna
open a Turkish bath!

789
00:54:00,870 --> 00:54:05,239
You had to feed
that monster!
And you had
to bring me to Alaska!

790
00:54:05,308 --> 00:54:07,708
You should
quit grousin'!

791
00:54:07,777 --> 00:54:11,144
You shoulda worn
ear muffs.
What for?
My ears fell off an hour ago.

792
00:54:11,214 --> 00:54:13,739
We find that mine,
you'll be a rich man.

793
00:54:13,817 --> 00:54:16,684
My hands are frozen, my feet,
everything's frozen!

794
00:54:16,753 --> 00:54:20,416
You'll be sittin'
on top of the world!
Everything's frozen!

795
00:54:24,427 --> 00:54:27,328
My nose is like
an icicle!

796
00:54:27,397 --> 00:54:30,389
Icicle?
That's a glacier!

797
00:54:30,467 --> 00:54:32,765
Hey, look!

798
00:54:32,836 --> 00:54:36,704
A pedestrian!
Huh!

799
00:54:36,773 --> 00:54:40,106
It's a dame!
A dame?
You kidding?

800
00:54:40,176 --> 00:54:42,736
What would a dame
be doing up here?
It could be Sonja Henie.

801
00:54:42,812 --> 00:54:47,340
Lemme see her.
Nothing doing. I found her.
Find one for yourself!

802
00:54:51,855 --> 00:54:54,790
Say,
she ain't bad.
Is she alive?

803
00:54:54,858 --> 00:54:58,419
Don't make no difference.
She's still mine.

804
00:54:58,495 --> 00:55:00,793
Ha-ha,
she's alive!
Pick her up.
She's frozen.

805
00:55:00,864 --> 00:55:03,958
I'd hate to be around
when she thaws out.

806
00:55:04,034 --> 00:55:06,366
Goldilocks, let's get
out of this frappe.

807
00:55:06,436 --> 00:55:08,836
Let me help.
Okay, but
don't enjoy it.

808
00:55:08,905 --> 00:55:11,840
No fuel shortage
for us.
I got my
little stove.

809
00:55:11,908 --> 00:55:14,138
Look who's here.

810
00:55:14,210 --> 00:55:16,041
What are you
doing here?

811
00:55:16,112 --> 00:55:18,808
We had a little date,
remember?

812
00:55:18,882 --> 00:55:21,373
Nobody stands up
Skagway Sal.
You've got me wrong.

813
00:55:21,451 --> 00:55:25,820
Who'd want to?
I've got my little stove now.

814
00:55:25,889 --> 00:55:28,983
Ahh, cabin...
over there.

815
00:55:29,059 --> 00:55:31,152
Get her to
the cabin fast.

816
00:55:31,227 --> 00:55:33,821
Buster, put your stove on
the sled and we'll run along.

817
00:55:33,897 --> 00:55:39,358
What are you gonna do?
We'd better start...
warming things up.

818
00:55:39,436 --> 00:55:41,495
That's how it stands.

819
00:55:41,571 --> 00:55:43,835
Either we get that map
off Sperry...

820
00:55:43,907 --> 00:55:46,341
or those butchers'll
be down in the morning.

821
00:55:46,409 --> 00:55:49,503
That's liable
to be a bit messy.

822
00:55:49,579 --> 00:55:53,208
Murder?
I believe that's
the word for it.

823
00:55:56,853 --> 00:55:59,754
Woop! Woop!
Ha-ha-ha!

824
00:55:59,823 --> 00:56:02,223
This is jolly,jolly.

825
00:56:02,292 --> 00:56:05,887
Snug-warm cabins,
congenial companions.

826
00:56:05,962 --> 00:56:09,056
Yes, sir! Doing
grand, grand, grand.

827
00:56:09,132 --> 00:56:12,101
I'd consider Sal showing up
quite a coincidence...

828
00:56:12,168 --> 00:56:14,602
if I didn't know how
crazy she was about me.

829
00:56:14,671 --> 00:56:18,198
Can't keep her eyes off me.
How come she's always
looking at me?

830
00:56:18,274 --> 00:56:20,538
She wants to see what
a bargain she's getting.

831
00:56:20,610 --> 00:56:23,272
I didn't notice her getting
the welcome mat out for you.

832
00:56:23,346 --> 00:56:27,077
I'm already in the kitchen
with my shoes off.

833
00:56:27,150 --> 00:56:31,587
Ooo, ooo!
Yes, sir, this is great.

834
00:56:31,654 --> 00:56:35,488
I think
my worm has B.O.
It couldn't be you.

835
00:56:37,060 --> 00:56:39,153
We'll get another.

836
00:56:41,965 --> 00:56:45,423
I will admit there's something
phony about that dame.

837
00:56:45,502 --> 00:56:48,164
She just don't seem
to belong here in Alaska.

838
00:56:48,238 --> 00:56:51,730
Are you kidding?
That shows how much
you know about women.

839
00:56:51,808 --> 00:56:55,744
Could you see that girl
anywhere but Alaska?

840
00:57:08,758 --> 00:57:12,194
Nah, I guess not.
See what I mean?

841
00:57:12,262 --> 00:57:16,130
You don't know any more
about women than you do
about fishing!

842
00:57:16,199 --> 00:57:18,633
No?
You see what the
score is, don't you?

843
00:57:18,701 --> 00:57:24,139
Duke, 1 3. Chester, 0.
You're skunked, ol' boy.
You're using loaded bait.

844
00:57:24,207 --> 00:57:26,437
When it comes to fishing,
you can't tell how good a guy is...

845
00:57:26,509 --> 00:57:29,205
until you know
what he's fishing for.
Hi, boys.

846
00:57:29,279 --> 00:57:31,804
Here's my filet.
Warm it, honey,
right here.

847
00:57:31,881 --> 00:57:35,044
McGurk, I'd like to be
alone with Sperry.

848
00:57:35,118 --> 00:57:39,680
Run over to Peoria and get me
a ham sandwich and check with
me in about three years.

849
00:57:39,756 --> 00:57:42,725
We may need you
as a bridesmaid.
Wait.

850
00:57:42,792 --> 00:57:45,420
Number 1 4
just checked in.

851
00:57:45,495 --> 00:57:49,158
Well, if you're a good boy,
I'll save you a few heads.

852
00:57:49,232 --> 00:57:51,200
Pick one out
for yourself.

853
00:57:51,267 --> 00:57:54,202
That guy burns me up,
him and his 1 4 fish.

854
00:57:54,270 --> 00:57:56,397
You'd think there
was no romance left.

855
00:57:56,473 --> 00:58:00,170
Think all a fella had to do
was catch one crummy fish!

856
00:58:00,243 --> 00:58:02,837
Let's go for a walk
in the woods.
Just a minute.

857
00:58:02,912 --> 00:58:04,971
I got more nibbles
than I can handle.

858
00:58:06,282 --> 00:58:08,079
Hey, bud,
where's your partner?

859
00:58:08,151 --> 00:58:11,450
He just stepped into--
huh?

860
00:58:11,521 --> 00:58:13,921
Just tell him
15 was here.

861
00:58:13,990 --> 00:58:16,550
Come on!

862
00:58:16,626 --> 00:58:18,617
Okay.

863
00:58:18,695 --> 00:58:20,629
Come on!

864
00:58:37,013 --> 00:58:40,312
Come on, folks.
Quit following us, will ya?

865
00:58:48,224 --> 00:58:51,091
It's funny, us going
for each other this way.

866
00:58:51,160 --> 00:58:54,323
I guess
it just had to be.
We couldn't help it.

867
00:58:54,397 --> 00:58:56,627
We were thrown together
by fate.

868
00:58:56,699 --> 00:58:59,759
You weren't thrown together.
That took planning.

869
00:58:59,836 --> 00:59:02,031
Oh, what a project!

870
00:59:02,105 --> 00:59:04,198
Let's sit down.

871
00:59:04,274 --> 00:59:07,766
The minute I heard you sing,
it hit me in the old ticker.

872
00:59:07,844 --> 00:59:11,837
It was going... pitter-patter.
Then... patter-pitter!

873
00:59:11,915 --> 00:59:15,851
How's it going now?
I can't tell
pitter from patter.

874
00:59:24,561 --> 00:59:30,261
#You wouldn't dare
be too bold #

875
00:59:30,333 --> 00:59:32,665
#Would you #

876
00:59:32,735 --> 00:59:39,163
#And think that my hand
was to hold #

877
00:59:39,242 --> 00:59:41,870
#Would you #

878
00:59:41,945 --> 00:59:45,642
#And you
wouldn't play #

879
00:59:45,715 --> 00:59:50,152
# On my sympathy #

880
00:59:50,219 --> 00:59:55,953
#Then take advantage
of me #

881
00:59:56,960 --> 00:59:58,860
#Would you #

882
01:00:00,597 --> 01:00:06,467
#You shouldn't be
quite so near #

883
01:00:06,536 --> 01:00:08,868
# Should you #

884
01:00:08,938 --> 01:00:16,037
# Or whisper those words
in my ear #

885
01:00:16,112 --> 01:00:18,706
# Should you #

886
01:00:18,781 --> 01:00:24,048
#You can't get romantic #

887
01:00:24,120 --> 01:00:30,081
#That you know
takes two #

888
01:00:30,159 --> 01:00:33,128
# But darling #

889
01:00:33,196 --> 01:00:37,860
# If I would #

890
01:00:37,934 --> 01:00:46,000
#Would you ##

891
01:00:47,577 --> 01:00:50,068
Ha-ha!
Hot snow.

892
01:00:51,314 --> 01:00:53,248
Don't get anxious.

893
01:00:53,316 --> 01:00:55,944
Didn't anyone ever
tell you there'd be
moments like this?

894
01:00:56,019 --> 01:00:58,749
My school teacher...
just before we were expelled.

895
01:00:58,821 --> 01:01:01,722
Sperry, how long
must we wait?
Huh?

896
01:01:01,791 --> 01:01:05,420
McGurk's map. Suppose
he runs off with it?
I've got the other half!

897
01:01:05,495 --> 01:01:09,829
I hope it's
in a safe place.
Don't worry.
We're not amateurs.

898
01:01:09,899 --> 01:01:12,834
Where's the map?
There's only one map
I want to talk about.

899
01:01:12,902 --> 01:01:16,201
Yours...
that skin, those lips.
Where is it?

900
01:01:16,272 --> 01:01:19,935
Those eyes, they're beautiful--
and they match!

901
01:01:20,009 --> 01:01:21,977
Are you going
to tell me?

902
01:01:22,045 --> 01:01:24,138
Let's get back
to pitter-patter.

903
01:01:24,213 --> 01:01:27,011
Come on!
Dinner's ready.

904
01:01:28,251 --> 01:01:30,651
Who can eat?
Dinner.

905
01:01:35,391 --> 01:01:37,484
Whoa!
Look at those tracks.

906
01:01:37,560 --> 01:01:40,996
We must be on the
right trail. Come on!

907
01:01:43,199 --> 01:01:46,362
I never thought a woman'd
get me to washing dishes,
drying 'em and liking it.

908
01:01:46,436 --> 01:01:48,768
But I'm washing 'em
and I'm drying 'em...

909
01:01:48,838 --> 01:01:51,033
and I'm liking it!

910
01:01:52,208 --> 01:01:55,541
We'll need some water
for tomorrow's coffee.

911
01:01:55,611 --> 01:01:59,570
Do you mind?
I might as well
get used to it.

912
01:02:09,859 --> 01:02:12,760
I think I'll get
a little fresh air.

913
01:02:17,400 --> 01:02:19,891
Why'd you get rid
of Chowderhead?

914
01:02:19,969 --> 01:02:24,372
The map. He wants
to steal your half
and run away with me.

915
01:02:24,440 --> 01:02:27,102
Who are you kidding?
What map?

916
01:02:27,176 --> 01:02:29,610
He told you where
I had it, huh?

917
01:02:29,679 --> 01:02:32,443
Fine pal.
That's friendship for you.

918
01:02:32,515 --> 01:02:37,145
A man has to sink low when
he'll sell out his best friend.

919
01:02:37,220 --> 01:02:40,712
You wouldn't say where
his map is, would you?
You're darn right I wouldn't.

920
01:02:40,790 --> 01:02:45,193
It can stay in his
undershirt until it rots!
It shouldn't take long either.

921
01:02:45,261 --> 01:02:47,855
I trusted him.

922
01:02:47,930 --> 01:02:50,296
When do we leave?
Huh?

923
01:02:50,366 --> 01:02:52,391
Can we get
it tonight?

924
01:02:52,468 --> 01:02:55,437
You've been blowing hot and cold
all through this deal.

925
01:02:55,505 --> 01:02:58,872
How come all of a sudden
I'm your boy?
I'm particular...

926
01:02:58,941 --> 01:03:02,638
what type man I share
a gold mine with.

927
01:03:06,549 --> 01:03:09,211
That the type?
It'll do.

928
01:03:09,285 --> 01:03:11,185
Just some of
my lighter stuff.

929
01:03:11,254 --> 01:03:14,655
Promise me something.
Go back to Frisco and
give yourself up.

930
01:03:14,724 --> 01:03:18,251
What?
We'll fight together.
Maybe they won't hang you.

931
01:03:18,327 --> 01:03:20,386
I got a little T.L. for you.

932
01:03:20,463 --> 01:03:22,488
I'm not McGurk.

933
01:03:22,565 --> 01:03:26,023
It was all an act.
We found the map on the boat.

934
01:03:26,102 --> 01:03:29,629
My name's DukeJohnson.
I knew I couldn't
love a murderer.

935
01:03:29,705 --> 01:03:34,108
That Sperry,
he's the killer.
Oh, a
despicable character!

936
01:03:34,177 --> 01:03:36,145
Those weak eyes,
that shifty chin.

937
01:03:36,212 --> 01:03:38,544
Of course.
Definite criminal type.

938
01:03:38,614 --> 01:03:41,344
We'll take care
of him and his map.

939
01:03:41,417 --> 01:03:43,385
It isn't his map,
it's mine.

940
01:03:43,452 --> 01:03:46,285
It was my father's.
Now it's yours and mine.

941
01:03:46,355 --> 01:03:48,118
The mine, understand?

942
01:03:48,191 --> 01:03:50,887
I think the trip was
a little too much for you.

943
01:03:50,960 --> 01:03:55,056
I'll get the map tomorrow.
There's no time.
They'll kill you.

944
01:03:55,131 --> 01:03:57,565
Larson and those butchers
are up in the hills.

945
01:03:57,633 --> 01:03:59,726
Get some shut-eye.
It'll fix you up.

946
01:03:59,802 --> 01:04:03,966
I think this gal is cracking up.
put her to bed to get rest.

947
01:04:04,040 --> 01:04:06,838
I'll go case
the killer.

948
01:04:06,909 --> 01:04:09,844
But, Duke!

949
01:04:09,912 --> 01:04:11,903
Hey, what's going on?

950
01:04:11,981 --> 01:04:14,950
He's not McGurk and I'm
not going through with it.

951
01:04:15,017 --> 01:04:18,180
I'm in love with him.
You fool! Those thugs
are in the hills.

952
01:04:18,254 --> 01:04:20,484
If you love him, you've
got to go through with it.

953
01:04:20,556 --> 01:04:23,081
He's not McGurk.
They can't kill him.

954
01:04:23,159 --> 01:04:25,923
The only way you can save
him is to get to Ace Larson.

955
01:04:25,995 --> 01:04:29,522
You'll never get out
of here without that map.

956
01:04:29,599 --> 01:04:32,534
Well?
What do you say?

957
01:04:33,936 --> 01:04:37,064
We'll get it tonight
when they're asleep.

958
01:04:44,814 --> 01:04:50,047
#Welcome to my dream #

959
01:04:50,119 --> 01:04:53,520
#And how are you #

960
01:04:55,458 --> 01:04:59,485
#Will you be here long #

961
01:04:59,562 --> 01:05:02,759
# Or just passing through #

962
01:05:04,433 --> 01:05:08,335
# Brush off that stardust #

963
01:05:09,405 --> 01:05:12,806
#Where have you been #

964
01:05:12,875 --> 01:05:17,972
# Don't tell me
your rainbow #

965
01:05:18,047 --> 01:05:22,416
#Was late gettin' in #

966
01:05:25,888 --> 01:05:28,857
#Welcome to my dream #

967
01:05:30,026 --> 01:05:32,824
# It now seems real #

968
01:05:34,597 --> 01:05:37,031
#You're what it needed #

969
01:05:38,634 --> 01:05:41,899
#To make it ideal #

970
01:06:40,029 --> 01:06:42,520
Did you lose something?

971
01:07:35,418 --> 01:07:37,784
Is that you, honey?

972
01:07:37,853 --> 01:07:39,878
Don't say a word.
I'll do the talking.

973
01:07:39,955 --> 01:07:42,446
You're puffing.
You didn't have to run here.

974
01:07:42,525 --> 01:07:45,722
Things are gonna be different
after we're married.

975
01:07:45,795 --> 01:07:47,729
I'm gonna do
big things for you.

976
01:07:47,797 --> 01:07:52,791
I'm gonna buy you real furs.
You won't have to wear this
cheap imitation.

977
01:07:52,868 --> 01:07:55,803
I'm gonna buy you a home.
No more sleeping on cold floors.

978
01:07:55,871 --> 01:07:59,534
- Gesundheit, dear.

979
01:07:59,608 --> 01:08:03,977
And the jewels I'm gonna buy!
Emerald bracelets down to there.

980
01:08:04,046 --> 01:08:05,980
And diamond rings
for your fingers too.

981
01:08:06,048 --> 01:08:09,245
They'll go so well with
those long nails of yours.

982
01:08:13,889 --> 01:08:17,086
Honey, you've been
working too hard!

983
01:08:18,961 --> 01:08:23,364
- Sperry, are you awake?
- Of course, I'm awake.

984
01:08:23,432 --> 01:08:27,801
- Who's that with you?
- Who do you think? It's you.

985
01:08:29,071 --> 01:08:30,698
Grr.

986
01:08:34,076 --> 01:08:36,135
It's... a bear.

987
01:08:36,212 --> 01:08:39,181
Keep calm,
just keep calm.

988
01:08:39,248 --> 01:08:41,307
Help!

989
01:08:41,383 --> 01:08:44,477
Who's your girlfriend,
Junior?
It's a bear.
Do something!

990
01:08:44,553 --> 01:08:46,714
Who do you think I am,
Daniel Boone?

991
01:08:46,789 --> 01:08:49,690
Looks like we've got
another mouth to feed.
Looks like I'm on the menu.

992
01:08:49,758 --> 01:08:52,591
Get my arm
out of here.
She likes
affection maybe.

993
01:08:52,661 --> 01:08:56,620
Keep it up or
we'll both be bear bait.

994
01:08:56,699 --> 01:08:59,190
We'll be so happy together.

995
01:08:59,268 --> 01:09:02,897
I can see us romping
around Yellowstone Park.

996
01:09:02,972 --> 01:09:05,372
- We'll live with your folks.
- Grrr!

997
01:09:05,441 --> 01:09:07,500
All right,
with my folks!

998
01:09:07,576 --> 01:09:09,703
We'll raise a family,
a boy for you, a bear for me.

999
01:09:09,778 --> 01:09:13,236
Help!
We're cooked.
Here's the house detective.

1000
01:09:36,872 --> 01:09:39,568
A fine thing!
A fish they let talk.

1001
01:09:39,642 --> 01:09:41,940
Me... they won't give
one stinking line!

1002
01:09:49,051 --> 01:09:53,112
Whoa! Whoa!

1003
01:09:53,189 --> 01:09:56,181
I hope
he'll understand.
Quit worrying.

1004
01:09:56,258 --> 01:09:59,750
Come on, Lebec.
Let's go.
Mush!

1005
01:10:18,080 --> 01:10:21,880
Come on! Cut it out.

1006
01:10:21,951 --> 01:10:25,478
Fix our breakfast, Dollface.
We'll see you later.

1007
01:10:25,554 --> 01:10:28,114
Ahh.
Come on, girls.

1008
01:10:30,392 --> 01:10:32,189
Hi, fellas.

1009
01:10:32,261 --> 01:10:34,286
Where's that map?

1010
01:10:34,363 --> 01:10:37,526
The map?
Oh-- Oh, the map!

1011
01:10:37,600 --> 01:10:40,398
Yeah, the map.
Don't worry.
We got it.

1012
01:10:40,469 --> 01:10:44,235
Yeah, we got it.
It's in his cap
and in my--

1013
01:10:46,942 --> 01:10:49,536
Let me see that cap.!

1014
01:11:00,189 --> 01:11:02,248
Okay, this is it.

1015
01:11:02,324 --> 01:11:04,815
Wait. We'll get
the map for you.
Sure.

1016
01:11:04,893 --> 01:11:07,259
Where is it?
Well, it's in--

1017
01:11:07,329 --> 01:11:11,060
It's in the
bear's mouth.
Get it
and be quick.

1018
01:11:19,775 --> 01:11:23,575
Smart guys, us.
We're a couple of pigeons.

1019
01:11:23,646 --> 01:11:26,444
A dame hits us twice
with those big moose eyes...

1020
01:11:26,515 --> 01:11:28,813
and we start
giving away gold mines.

1021
01:11:28,884 --> 01:11:31,785
If we get that map back,
I'm brushing dames off forever.

1022
01:11:31,854 --> 01:11:33,788
They're poison.

1023
01:11:33,856 --> 01:11:37,622
They run their fingers
through your hair, then
throw you in the gutter.

1024
01:11:37,693 --> 01:11:39,888
You know
what's worse?
What?

1025
01:11:39,962 --> 01:11:41,987
I love it.

1026
01:11:42,064 --> 01:11:45,761
Next time,
we shoot first.
And ask questions afterwards.

1027
01:11:45,834 --> 01:11:47,893
Those guys are green.
They won't get far.

1028
01:11:47,970 --> 01:11:51,371
They took our dogs!
Those ain't the only dogs
in Alaska!

1029
01:11:51,440 --> 01:11:53,499
We'll find some.

1030
01:11:57,179 --> 01:11:59,272
A couple of
prospectors.
Yeah.

1031
01:11:59,348 --> 01:12:02,044
Reach!

1032
01:12:09,591 --> 01:12:11,821
Mush!

1033
01:12:17,199 --> 01:12:19,326
They got a good start.
We'll catch 'em.

1034
01:12:19,401 --> 01:12:23,861
Did you ever think
of those dog teams?

1035
01:12:23,939 --> 01:12:27,898
The lead dog is the only dog
that gets a change of scenery.

1036
01:12:28,344 --> 01:12:31,108
Care for
another pillow?

1037
01:12:31,180 --> 01:12:33,148
No, I'm fairly
comfortable.
Yes.

1038
01:12:33,215 --> 01:12:35,445
Mind the bumps
like a good fella, eh?

1039
01:12:37,353 --> 01:12:38,945
Whoa!

1040
01:12:39,021 --> 01:12:40,818
There they are.

1041
01:12:42,391 --> 01:12:45,918
Who's that?
Moose hunting.

1042
01:12:48,197 --> 01:12:52,657
Mush, mush!
Mush. I'm dying
and you want to eat.

1043
01:12:52,735 --> 01:12:55,465
Go ahead.
Come on, boy!

1044
01:12:55,537 --> 01:12:59,132
Boy! Why didn't
I think of this before?

1045
01:12:59,208 --> 01:13:01,608
Exciting, isn't it?

1046
01:13:01,677 --> 01:13:04,669
If Hope and Crosby are caught,
they'll be killed.

1047
01:13:04,747 --> 01:13:07,341
They won't be able to tell
any more of those jokes.

1048
01:13:07,416 --> 01:13:10,146
Come on,
mush, mush!

1049
01:13:14,623 --> 01:13:18,753
Whoa! What is this?
Alcatraz?
Let's hit
for the rocks.

1050
01:13:18,827 --> 01:13:21,125
It's our
only chance.
Hey, they'll find us.

1051
01:13:21,196 --> 01:13:24,222
It's either us
or them.
My money's on them.

1052
01:13:24,299 --> 01:13:26,460
I'll take this rope.
We may need it.

1053
01:13:53,061 --> 01:13:57,691
Nice place to throw
the Grand Canyon.
All this ice
and no ginger ale.

1054
01:13:57,766 --> 01:14:00,758
Stay up.
You'll get a draw.

1055
01:14:01,703 --> 01:14:04,866
You all right?

1056
01:14:04,940 --> 01:14:09,070
We gotta get out somewhere,
either up or down.

1057
01:14:09,144 --> 01:14:12,045
It ain't down.
Let's go down the middle.
Okay.

1058
01:14:12,114 --> 01:14:14,344
Oh-oh, dead end.

1059
01:14:14,416 --> 01:14:18,352
A one-way mountain.
What'll we do now?
We'll use the rope.

1060
01:14:18,420 --> 01:14:21,912
There must be some
reason for it.
It might catch on a tree, huh?

1061
01:14:21,990 --> 01:14:24,720
They gotta be here
somewhere.

1062
01:14:24,793 --> 01:14:27,193
Here goes.
One in a million.
Throw a nail up too.

1063
01:14:30,933 --> 01:14:33,231
Oh, hey!
Help!

1064
01:14:33,302 --> 01:14:37,033
We made it!
Made it?
Boy, one in a million.

1065
01:14:41,210 --> 01:14:43,405
One in a million!
It's solid, let's go.

1066
01:14:43,479 --> 01:14:44,969
Woop!

1067
01:14:45,981 --> 01:14:48,381
Hold on!

1068
01:14:50,385 --> 01:14:52,853
Oh, boy.

1069
01:14:52,921 --> 01:14:55,913
Say, you got
a match?
Yeah. Ohhh!

1070
01:14:55,991 --> 01:14:58,152
What's the matter?
You crazy?

1071
01:14:58,227 --> 01:15:00,923
Match. Rub your head
against the rocks.

1072
01:15:04,366 --> 01:15:07,665
All out.
Top floor.

1073
01:15:07,736 --> 01:15:09,499
Going down.

1074
01:15:09,571 --> 01:15:12,096
I'm slipping.
Untie your boot.

1075
01:15:12,174 --> 01:15:15,666
You touch that boot and
I'll cut your hand off!

1076
01:15:15,744 --> 01:15:18,110
Boy, that'll hold 'em.

1077
01:15:18,180 --> 01:15:20,273
We could've been killed!

1078
01:15:24,920 --> 01:15:28,651
Hey, am I dead?
I can't tell.
You always look that way.

1079
01:15:28,724 --> 01:15:30,589
Come on!

1080
01:15:35,898 --> 01:15:37,763
Shh!

1081
01:15:40,702 --> 01:15:43,262
Shh.
Shh!

1082
01:15:47,009 --> 01:15:50,001
Shh! One little sound
starts a whole avalanche.

1083
01:15:52,848 --> 01:15:55,715
I should have
worn my derby.
You want them to hear us?

1084
01:15:55,784 --> 01:15:58,378
Hiccup the other way.
That's the only way
I know how.

1085
01:15:58,453 --> 01:16:00,648
Suppress it somehow.

1086
01:16:00,722 --> 01:16:02,952
Frighten me.
I can't.
I haven't got a mirror.

1087
01:16:03,025 --> 01:16:04,890
Sing something.
Huh?

1088
01:16:08,463 --> 01:16:10,727
It's cracking up.
One little sound
starts an avalanche.

1089
01:16:10,799 --> 01:16:13,461
Don't worry.
I'm okay now.

1090
01:16:13,535 --> 01:16:17,130
Concentrate. Count to 20.
I can't. I've
got my mittens on.

1091
01:16:17,205 --> 01:16:20,140
Count!
Five, ten, fifteen--

1092
01:16:23,879 --> 01:16:26,712
What now?
I think one more
will do it.

1093
01:16:26,782 --> 01:16:30,240
Let's see you come up
with something now.

1094
01:16:30,319 --> 01:16:33,948
Ready, aim, fire.
I can't.
I'm out of gas.

1095
01:16:34,022 --> 01:16:37,549
Think of something, somebody.
W.C. Fields.
Who?

1096
01:16:45,000 --> 01:16:47,366
Now for Dawson City
and those dames!

1097
01:16:47,436 --> 01:16:50,530
Dames! We'll be lucky
if we get to Dawson City.

1098
01:16:50,606 --> 01:16:54,201
Just a minute.
I'm the navigator.
What? Again?

1099
01:17:05,954 --> 01:17:08,684
They're not Sperry and McGurk.
It's all a mistake.

1100
01:17:08,757 --> 01:17:11,487
Mistakes happen,
but that can be remedied.

1101
01:17:11,560 --> 01:17:14,529
I'll send a couple boys
back to the cabin...

1102
01:17:14,596 --> 01:17:16,587
and they can explain things
to Sperry and McGurk.

1103
01:17:16,665 --> 01:17:20,931
They're not Sperry
and McGurk!
Well, whoever they are.

1104
01:17:21,003 --> 01:17:23,597
You wait here.

1105
01:17:24,940 --> 01:17:27,670
I don't want
any slipup.
How do we spot 'em?

1106
01:17:27,743 --> 01:17:32,077
Wherever they go,
they travel with
a big shaggy dog.

1107
01:17:32,147 --> 01:17:34,342
Drink up.
Keep your eyes open.

1108
01:17:34,416 --> 01:17:36,577
They may be on
their way here now.

1109
01:17:39,988 --> 01:17:42,218
Mush, mush!

1110
01:17:42,290 --> 01:17:46,090
Whoa, you dogs.
Okay, gas up, kids.
Very tiring trip.

1111
01:17:46,161 --> 01:17:49,096
I should've had you at
the other end of the sled.

1112
01:17:49,164 --> 01:17:52,099
Come on, Curly.
Where you going
with that fleabag?

1113
01:17:52,167 --> 01:17:54,601
We got trouble enough.
Stake her out there.
Don't want her?

1114
01:17:54,670 --> 01:17:57,901
Put her over here.
Wait for us, Fuzz.

1115
01:17:57,973 --> 01:18:00,908
If you see anything in slacks,
bark twice and I'll join you.

1116
01:18:00,976 --> 01:18:03,945
Don't forget,
be fair.

1117
01:18:10,385 --> 01:18:12,319
We act tough.

1118
01:18:12,387 --> 01:18:15,618
Mosey over to the bar
and ask a few questions.
Why, ''shore.''

1119
01:18:35,811 --> 01:18:38,177
Couple of strangers
in town.

1120
01:18:38,246 --> 01:18:41,340
Hello, boys.
You new in town?
Yeah.
Yeah.

1121
01:18:41,416 --> 01:18:43,714
Join me
in a drink?
Don't mind
if we do.

1122
01:18:43,785 --> 01:18:46,948
What'll you have?
Oh, a couple fingers
of rotgut.

1123
01:18:47,022 --> 01:18:50,685
What's yours?
I'll take a lemonade...
in a dirty glass!

1124
01:18:50,759 --> 01:18:52,750
What's all
the celebration?

1125
01:18:52,828 --> 01:18:54,955
A posse. There's going
to be a little hanging.

1126
01:18:55,030 --> 01:18:58,090
Little hanging, huh?
Well, what do you know.
Hanging, huh?

1127
01:18:58,166 --> 01:19:00,634
Well, that's
''noose'' to me.

1128
01:19:00,702 --> 01:19:03,569
That's noose--
I made a joke.

1129
01:19:06,575 --> 01:19:08,702
We're killing 'em here.
Or vice versa.

1130
01:19:08,777 --> 01:19:11,245
Hangin', huh?
Sounds gay.

1131
01:19:11,313 --> 01:19:13,508
Sure does.
Happy hunting, partner.

1132
01:19:13,582 --> 01:19:19,384
Who are you stringing up?
Couple of fellas who call
themselves Sperry and McGurk.

1133
01:19:19,454 --> 01:19:21,979
You don't happen
to know them, do you?

1134
01:19:22,057 --> 01:19:25,720
I know Sperry when I see McGurk.
I mean, I know McGurk when--

1135
01:19:25,794 --> 01:19:27,728
Never heard of'em.

1136
01:19:27,796 --> 01:19:29,593
Join us?

1137
01:19:29,664 --> 01:19:32,963
We'd love to,
but it's getting late.
Got a little ironing to do.

1138
01:19:33,034 --> 01:19:35,002
Hey, you!

1139
01:19:35,070 --> 01:19:37,971
It's going to be
a lovely hanging, boys.

1140
01:19:38,039 --> 01:19:40,872
I have an idea
you ought to be there.

1141
01:19:40,942 --> 01:19:44,469
Look, stranger, how you
gonna hang these fellows?

1142
01:19:44,546 --> 01:19:46,810
You don't know 'em.
How 'bout that?

1143
01:19:46,882 --> 01:19:49,043
We'll know 'em
when we see 'em.

1144
01:19:49,117 --> 01:19:52,814
They always travel
with a big shaggy dog.

1145
01:19:52,888 --> 01:19:55,584
Well, I--
I-yi-yi-yi.
I-yi-yi-yi.

1146
01:19:55,657 --> 01:19:57,716
A big shaggy dog,
huh?
Yeah!

1147
01:20:03,465 --> 01:20:07,162
The minute we see that dog,
we're gonna string them up.

1148
01:20:07,235 --> 01:20:10,534
The minute
you see the dog--
Gonna string them up, eh?

1149
01:20:10,605 --> 01:20:14,541
Sounds like a cinch.
All you gotta do
is find a big shaggy dog.

1150
01:20:14,609 --> 01:20:18,739
Alaska's full of them
big shaggy fellas.
A dime a dozen around here.

1151
01:20:22,584 --> 01:20:24,552
All you have to do...

1152
01:20:24,619 --> 01:20:27,144
is find a big
shaggy dog?
What's the
matter with him?

1153
01:20:27,222 --> 01:20:30,385
His foot's gone to sleep.
Stomp on it a bit.

1154
01:20:30,458 --> 01:20:32,926
- Woof!
- Woof!

1155
01:20:32,994 --> 01:20:35,622
Woof!
Woof!
He thinks he's a dog.

1156
01:20:35,697 --> 01:20:37,665
His mother was frightened
by a Pekingese.

1157
01:20:37,732 --> 01:20:40,257
Woof.
Woof, woof.
That's all right, Rover.

1158
01:20:40,335 --> 01:20:43,236
Gimme your paw, Rover.
Gimme your paw.

1159
01:20:43,305 --> 01:20:45,466
That's a good dog.
Okay,
I'm over it.

1160
01:20:45,540 --> 01:20:47,872
You don't think
you're a dog?
I'm not a dog.

1161
01:20:47,943 --> 01:20:50,741
You feel all right?
Feel how cold
my nose is.

1162
01:20:50,812 --> 01:20:54,009
Oh, what a hot horn!
This is a sick dog, sick boy.

1163
01:20:54,082 --> 01:20:56,380
He doesn't look sick.
Let me hear that bark.

1164
01:20:56,451 --> 01:20:58,248
- Woof!
- Woof!

1165
01:20:58,320 --> 01:21:00,618
Quite a big echo.
Come on, Fido.
Woof, woof!

1166
01:21:00,689 --> 01:21:02,680
Oh, he's gone again.

1167
01:21:02,757 --> 01:21:04,918
He's gone.

1168
01:21:07,362 --> 01:21:11,389
Downhill... the
whole place slants.
Whoa, boy.

1169
01:21:13,969 --> 01:21:16,460
Woof!
Woof!

1170
01:21:16,538 --> 01:21:17,937
Woof!

1171
01:21:19,541 --> 01:21:22,772
A little congested.
We'll use
the family entrance.

1172
01:21:22,844 --> 01:21:24,812
Woof, woof, woof!

1173
01:21:28,717 --> 01:21:31,686
It's been fun!

1174
01:21:58,113 --> 01:22:01,514
Let's get 'em!
Come on, boys!

1175
01:22:02,550 --> 01:22:04,745
Hey! Sal.

1176
01:22:04,819 --> 01:22:07,083
Why...
the little crook.

1177
01:22:07,155 --> 01:22:10,090
That's the story, Mr. Lebec.
Kate can tell you.

1178
01:22:10,158 --> 01:22:12,786
The only reason I went through
with it was to save their lives.

1179
01:22:12,861 --> 01:22:14,852
I'm in love
with one of them.

1180
01:22:14,930 --> 01:22:18,525
I'd die before I'd let
anything happen to him.

1181
01:22:18,600 --> 01:22:20,830
Very noble of you.

1182
01:22:20,902 --> 01:22:23,632
Imagine a girl
loving a guy that much.

1183
01:22:23,705 --> 01:22:26,765
Yeah.
I'm not worth it.

1184
01:22:26,841 --> 01:22:31,039
I'm a regular
Casablanca.
Casanova!

1185
01:22:31,112 --> 01:22:33,103
When did they
change that?

1186
01:22:33,181 --> 01:22:37,743
Mr. Larson will understand.
They're here!
Put the map in the safe.

1187
01:22:37,819 --> 01:22:41,880
What about her?
Tie her up. I'll
take care of her later.

1188
01:22:41,957 --> 01:22:45,654
Why the dirty--

1189
01:22:45,727 --> 01:22:48,560
I told you they wouldn't
let you say that.

1190
01:22:55,937 --> 01:22:59,168
We gotta save her!
We'll get that map first.
It's hers!

1191
01:22:59,240 --> 01:23:01,401
Suppose they
knock her off?
They'll be
looking for us.

1192
01:23:01,476 --> 01:23:04,468
We'll get the map and the girl.
What a parley!
Now you're talking.

1193
01:23:06,381 --> 01:23:09,077
Come on, push, push!

1194
01:23:09,150 --> 01:23:12,085
Hey, get out.
Go chase a tree.

1195
01:23:12,153 --> 01:23:14,451
Get rid of him.
Throw something.

1196
01:23:14,522 --> 01:23:17,548
A stick or something.
Get me some brandy.
A stick, yeah.

1197
01:23:17,625 --> 01:23:20,253
Sic! Go!
That way.

1198
01:23:27,769 --> 01:23:30,363
What do you hear?
Shh!

1199
01:23:30,438 --> 01:23:33,635
Who taught you
that racket?
My old man.

1200
01:23:33,708 --> 01:23:36,233
Oh, following in your
father's fingerprints, huh?

1201
01:23:36,311 --> 01:23:39,838
He was great.
Need a little light.

1202
01:23:39,914 --> 01:23:42,974
I'll light
the lantern.
No, you crazy?
They'll see us.

1203
01:23:43,885 --> 01:23:46,376
There's a box
of candles.

1204
01:23:46,454 --> 01:23:49,252
It's a funny-looking candle.

1205
01:23:49,324 --> 01:23:51,884
Why has it got
such a big wick?

1206
01:23:51,960 --> 01:23:54,758
The nights up here
are six months long.
Oh.

1207
01:23:54,829 --> 01:23:57,821
And me with insomnia.

1208
01:23:57,899 --> 01:24:00,891
There's something wrong
with this thing.
Blow on it a little.

1209
01:24:00,969 --> 01:24:02,960
Bring it down here.
Let me see.

1210
01:24:03,038 --> 01:24:06,530
Duke, I'm kinda glad
you talked me into this deal.

1211
01:24:06,608 --> 01:24:08,735
You said it was Utopia
and you were right.

1212
01:24:08,810 --> 01:24:13,179
It's been a lot of work
and I've beefed a lot
but I'll never blow up again.

1213
01:24:13,248 --> 01:24:15,273
Come to Papa.

1214
01:24:15,350 --> 01:24:18,046
There you are, you
pleasant little parchment.
That's great!

1215
01:24:18,119 --> 01:24:21,247
It's only sensational.
Sensational?
It's dynamite!

1216
01:24:23,725 --> 01:24:26,523
It's dynamite!
Take it, it's dynamite.

1217
01:24:26,594 --> 01:24:29,825
Dynamite?
Well, finders keepers!
I couldn't stand the noise.

1218
01:24:29,898 --> 01:24:32,924
Wait for me.
Throw it out the window.
Out the window!

1219
01:24:46,948 --> 01:24:49,883
Back away.
Don't crowd, you dog.
Take five.

1220
01:24:49,951 --> 01:24:53,387
You had to bring that dog!
This is no time to go
shooting off your mouth.

1221
01:24:53,455 --> 01:24:58,154
He's going to do it for us.
Oh, what a fur coat
he's going to make.

1222
01:25:00,762 --> 01:25:03,424
Locked?
Let's spread out
before the joint does.

1223
01:25:04,833 --> 01:25:07,927
They must be here.
Get out and find them.

1224
01:25:08,002 --> 01:25:13,668
Maybe we could sneak through.
That's a slaughter house.
You wanna hang upside down?

1225
01:25:14,642 --> 01:25:17,406
What size hook
do you want?

1226
01:25:20,014 --> 01:25:21,743
Look.!

1227
01:25:27,088 --> 01:25:29,852
Dynamite, see?
The real thing, see?

1228
01:25:29,924 --> 01:25:33,018
I'll give you three to get
out of here. One, two--

1229
01:25:39,267 --> 01:25:43,795
Nice going. Douse it!
Put it out!
Ooo, got a hot knuckle.

1230
01:25:43,872 --> 01:25:47,672
Attaboy.
Thought they could
scare me, huh?

1231
01:25:47,742 --> 01:25:50,438
You got plenty of heart.
It's just close in here.

1232
01:25:50,512 --> 01:25:53,037
What round was it?
Let's find Sal
and get out.

1233
01:25:53,114 --> 01:25:55,810
In here.!
Right rudder.

1234
01:25:55,884 --> 01:25:59,081
Don't worry, baby.
We're here now.

1235
01:25:59,154 --> 01:26:02,612
We showed 'em!
We're not amateurs.
No, sir!

1236
01:26:02,690 --> 01:26:05,124
Get you outta here
in no time.

1237
01:26:05,193 --> 01:26:08,060
We'll get you outta here.
Don't worry.

1238
01:26:08,129 --> 01:26:10,290
I smell
something burning.

1239
01:26:10,365 --> 01:26:12,299
The dynamite!
Put that out!

1240
01:26:12,367 --> 01:26:14,301
Ooo! It's me!
Here!

1241
01:26:17,572 --> 01:26:19,802
Come on.

1242
01:26:19,874 --> 01:26:21,899
It's dynamite going off
in there!

1243
01:26:21,976 --> 01:26:24,444
Where's that map?
Okay, you win.

1244
01:26:24,512 --> 01:26:27,345
Start talking!
It's in there in the desk.
Third drawer from the right.

1245
01:26:27,415 --> 01:26:29,474
Want us to get it?
No more of
your tricks.

1246
01:26:29,551 --> 01:26:32,577
This time, we'll
get it ourselves!

1247
01:26:32,654 --> 01:26:36,488
We'll hear from them later.
They'll be men about town.
Let's go.

1248
01:26:45,466 --> 01:26:47,730
Well, that's it.

1249
01:26:47,802 --> 01:26:51,795
The map, the mine,
the three million dollars.
Not quite.

1250
01:26:51,873 --> 01:26:53,807
Mush!

1251
01:26:53,875 --> 01:26:56,002
Come on!

1252
01:27:14,629 --> 01:27:16,494
Look!
No hands!

1253
01:27:16,564 --> 01:27:19,795
Watch out, no teeth.
Please...
my sponsor.

1254
01:27:40,622 --> 01:27:42,522
This way, come on!
Wait. That's north.

1255
01:27:42,590 --> 01:27:45,320
There isn't any north.
I suppose it went
south for the winter!

1256
01:27:45,393 --> 01:27:48,055
You're near
the North Pole.
What about it?

1257
01:27:48,129 --> 01:27:50,962
There's no north,
south, east or west.
You're crazy!

1258
01:27:51,032 --> 01:27:54,900
East is east and west is west
and never the twain shall meet.

1259
01:27:54,969 --> 01:27:58,598
There's no direction
at the North Pole.
An eight-year-old knows that.

1260
01:27:58,673 --> 01:28:02,336
Next time come here
with an eight-year-old child.
You'll do!

1261
01:28:02,410 --> 01:28:04,776
- Are you getting shorter?
- Me? How 'bout you?

1262
01:28:04,846 --> 01:28:07,747
Oh, I thought it was
getting drafty.

1263
01:28:07,815 --> 01:28:09,908
Aaah!

1264
01:28:16,090 --> 01:28:18,786
Look out.!
They're coming behind you.

1265
01:28:18,860 --> 01:28:21,090
Come on,jump.!

1266
01:28:21,162 --> 01:28:23,687
I can't make it.

1267
01:28:23,765 --> 01:28:27,360
Here's the map.

1268
01:28:27,435 --> 01:28:29,801
I'll hold 'em off
as long as I can.

1269
01:28:29,871 --> 01:28:34,433
Take care of Sal.
She's yours now.
So long, Sal.

1270
01:28:34,509 --> 01:28:36,443
So long, Duke.
Boy, what a pal.

1271
01:28:36,511 --> 01:28:39,912
Anything I can do for you?
Any last requests?

1272
01:28:39,981 --> 01:28:41,881
Look up my mother.

1273
01:28:41,949 --> 01:28:45,976
- Anything else?
- Uh, give her my watch.

1274
01:28:46,054 --> 01:28:47,646
Anything else?

1275
01:28:47,722 --> 01:28:50,987
Tell her to
give you a hot foot.

1276
01:29:01,669 --> 01:29:04,866
What happened, Duke?
How did you get away?
Simple enough.

1277
01:29:04,939 --> 01:29:08,807
There were only 1 5 of them.
I picked them up one by one,

1278
01:29:08,876 --> 01:29:12,710
knocked 'em out and
tossed 'em in the chasm.
Naturally.

1279
01:29:12,780 --> 01:29:14,907
Sal, how
have you been?

1280
01:29:14,982 --> 01:29:17,917
How's he been
treating you?
No complaints, Duke.

1281
01:29:17,985 --> 01:29:23,355
Chester has been a devoted
husband and a fine father.

1282
01:29:23,424 --> 01:29:25,619
Father?
You have children?

1283
01:29:25,693 --> 01:29:29,185
One, a boy.
Would you like to see him?

1284
01:29:29,263 --> 01:29:31,163
Junior?

1285
01:29:34,869 --> 01:29:37,497
Did you call me, Mom?

1286
01:29:42,276 --> 01:29:44,540
We adopted him.
