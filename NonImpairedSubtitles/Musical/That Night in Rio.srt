00:02:39,125 --> 00:02:43,323
# My friends, I extend felicitations #

2
00:02:43,396 --> 00:02:46,593
#To our South American relations #

3
00:02:46,666 --> 00:02:50,102
# May we never leave behind us #

4
00:02:50,170 --> 00:02:54,266
#All the common ties that bind us #

5
00:02:54,340 --> 00:03:01,678
# 130 million people send regards to you #

6
00:03:01,748 --> 00:03:05,206
#And before I return #

7
00:03:05,285 --> 00:03:10,951
#There's one thing you can do #

8
00:03:11,024 --> 00:03:16,087
# Come on and sing #

9
00:03:16,162 --> 00:03:19,893
- #The chica-chica-boom-chic #

10
00:03:19,966 --> 00:03:22,196
#That crazy thing
the chica-chica-boom-chic #

11
00:03:22,268 --> 00:03:24,759
# Chic, chic, boom
Chic, chic, chica-boom #

12
00:03:24,837 --> 00:03:28,603
- # Brazilians found the chica-chica-boom #

13
00:03:28,675 --> 00:03:32,111
#They like the sound
of the chica-chica-boom-chic #

14
00:03:32,178 --> 00:03:34,806
# Boom, chica-boom
Chica-boom, chica-boom #

15
00:03:34,881 --> 00:03:39,648
- # It came down the Amazon #

16
00:03:39,719 --> 00:03:42,244
# From the jungle #

17
00:03:42,322 --> 00:03:44,722
#Where the natives greet
everyone they meet #

18
00:03:44,791 --> 00:03:47,919
# Beatin' on a tom-tom #

19
00:03:47,994 --> 00:03:50,258
# Boom, chica-boom
Boom, boom, boom, boom-boom #

20
00:03:50,330 --> 00:03:53,458
# Boom, chica-boom
Boom, boom, boom, boom-boom #

21
00:03:53,533 --> 00:03:58,766
- # It don't make sense
the chica-chica-boom-chic #

22
00:03:58,838 --> 00:04:00,931
# But it's immense
the chica-chica-boom #

23
00:04:01,007 --> 00:04:03,100
# Chica, chica, chica-boom #

24
00:04:03,176 --> 00:04:07,977
#That's all you've got to say #

25
00:04:08,047 --> 00:04:13,075
#To chase the jinx away #

26
00:04:13,152 --> 00:04:15,245
- # Chica, chica-boom #
- # Chica, chica-boom #

27
00:04:15,321 --> 00:04:17,186
# Chica, chica-boom, chic ##

28
00:07:11,497 --> 00:07:15,456
- What woman at what front table?
Besides, I never saw her before.

29
00:07:15,535 --> 00:07:19,665
That wasn't a ''hotel lobby'' smile I was
giving her. My smile belongs to my public.

30
00:07:19,739 --> 00:07:22,469
She's a customer, and she's entitled to it
like every other pretty girl-

31
00:07:22,542 --> 00:07:24,635
- I mean every other customer.

32
00:07:24,710 --> 00:07:28,043
I was not with her or anybody else
last night. I was home in bed by 12:30.

33
00:07:28,114 --> 00:07:30,207
- Oh, yeah?
- Yeah. I gotta get a new mattress.

34
00:07:41,227 --> 00:07:43,354
Senhoras e senhores...

35
00:07:43,429 --> 00:07:47,024
for an americano to be received like this
here in Rio is most gratifying.

36
00:07:47,099 --> 00:07:49,533
I thank you.
Immediately after the next number...

37
00:07:49,602 --> 00:07:53,834
I'd like to impersonate for you that celebrated
fiigure of Rio, that cavalier of the boulevards...

38
00:07:53,906 --> 00:07:56,340
the one and only
Baron Manuel Duarte.

39
00:07:59,812 --> 00:08:02,838
Senhorita Carmen-
She just fiinish her solo.

40
00:08:02,915 --> 00:08:06,749
- That's good. She still mad?
- She's always mad.

41
00:08:06,819 --> 00:08:10,380
- How's she coming up the stairs?
- Three at a time.

42
00:08:10,456 --> 00:08:13,152
She's mad, sweet girl.

43
00:08:24,403 --> 00:08:27,338
That's a good shot. Someday you're
gonna miss my head and hit that mirror.

44
00:08:27,406 --> 00:08:32,571
- Then think of all the bad luck you'll have.

45
00:08:32,645 --> 00:08:36,342
Listen, listen, listen. I've been tryin'
to teach you English for six months.

46
00:08:36,415 --> 00:08:39,748
You'll never learn unless you speak it.
And you can't speak it when you get excited.

47
00:08:39,819 --> 00:08:43,380
English isn't that kind of a language.
So don't get excited!

48
00:08:43,456 --> 00:08:47,449
Yeah, there. That's it.
Now, say what you're gonna say in English.

49
00:08:47,527 --> 00:08:52,590
- Okay. You is a low-down, no-good ham.
- Are a low-down, no-good ham.

50
00:08:52,665 --> 00:08:55,190
You are a low-down,
no-good ham.

51
00:08:55,268 --> 00:08:57,702
That's fiine.
That's fiine.

52
00:08:57,770 --> 00:09:00,898
You are a low-down,
no-good ham.

53
00:09:00,973 --> 00:09:03,237
Perfect, perfect.
That's perfect.

54
00:09:03,309 --> 00:09:05,539
Senhor, senhor.

55
00:09:06,846 --> 00:09:08,871
Obrigado.

56
00:09:08,948 --> 00:09:11,007
The package
is for Senhor Martin.

57
00:09:13,853 --> 00:09:17,914
Uh, just a little cod-liver oil.
I'm a little run-down from all this night work.

58
00:09:17,990 --> 00:09:21,551
- Night work, eh?
- You want me I should hit her on the head?

59
00:09:26,232 --> 00:09:28,894
You grass in the snake.

60
00:09:28,968 --> 00:09:31,835
Now look what you done, you little jaguar.
You ripped me to shreds.

61
00:09:31,904 --> 00:09:33,997
Get me some iodine, Alfonso,
before fever sets in.

62
00:09:34,073 --> 00:09:39,443
Oh, Larry, why you don't tell me,
Larry? So beautiful.

63
00:09:39,512 --> 00:09:44,449
What a woman. What a woman. You know,
little turtle, that was supposed to be a surprise.

64
00:09:44,517 --> 00:09:46,951
Oh, Larry.

65
00:09:47,019 --> 00:09:50,250
- I am so sorry, Larry.
- Yeah, naturally.

66
00:09:50,323 --> 00:09:53,656
- Beat me. Kill me.
- Later. Remind me, will you?

67
00:09:53,726 --> 00:09:56,854
Oh, my terrible temper.
I should not lose him.

68
00:09:56,929 --> 00:09:59,796
You haven't lost him, baby.
He's still there. All he wants is a break.

69
00:09:59,865 --> 00:10:03,995
- Oh, I am bad, bad, bad.
- Yeah, bad and beautiful.

70
00:10:04,070 --> 00:10:06,868
And after all, maybe it, uh-

71
00:10:06,939 --> 00:10:09,601
- Maybe it was a little bit my fault.
- What you mean?

72
00:10:09,675 --> 00:10:13,543
- Well, maybe I did smile at that girl a little.
- Oh, so you admit her?

73
00:10:13,613 --> 00:10:16,343
No, no, no. I haven't
admitted her yet. I said ''maybe.''

74
00:10:20,720 --> 00:10:23,450
You know who just came in?
Baron Duarte.

75
00:10:27,059 --> 00:10:30,187
Baron Duarte?

76
00:10:30,262 --> 00:10:33,390
- Good evening, Baroness. Good evening, Baron.
- Good evening.

77
00:10:33,466 --> 00:10:35,491
This way, please.

78
00:10:57,390 --> 00:11:00,655
This is a great honor, Baron.
I hope this table is satisfactory.

79
00:11:00,726 --> 00:11:03,024
If there is anything you desire,
please do not hesitate-

80
00:11:03,095 --> 00:11:05,893
Everything is quite satisfactory.
Thank you. Thank you.

81
00:11:21,681 --> 00:11:23,706
- Hello?
- No.

82
00:11:23,783 --> 00:11:25,717
- Yes?
- Oh.

83
00:11:25,785 --> 00:11:27,582
#We must see
the baron immediately #

84
00:11:27,653 --> 00:11:29,518
#We've waited and waited
How long will he be #

85
00:11:29,588 --> 00:11:31,579
- Hello?
- Oh.

86
00:11:31,657 --> 00:11:34,182
- Yes.
- No.

87
00:11:34,260 --> 00:11:38,287
#The baron is in conference
and he cannot be seen today #

88
00:11:38,364 --> 00:11:42,300
- #You mean #
- #We mean, we certainly mean
he cannot be seen today #

89
00:11:42,368 --> 00:11:46,202
# I came all the way from Uruguay
on matters very vital #

90
00:11:46,272 --> 00:11:50,038
- # I'm a man of high repute #
- #And I'm a man of title #

91
00:11:50,109 --> 00:11:56,139
# But the baron is in conference
and he cannot be seen today #

92
00:11:56,215 --> 00:11:58,547
- # Is he busy #
- # Busy, is he #

93
00:11:58,617 --> 00:12:00,915
- # Busy, is he #
- # Is he busy #

94
00:12:00,986 --> 00:12:03,284
#All appointments have been canceled #

95
00:12:03,355 --> 00:12:05,550
# Every one must be postponed #

96
00:12:05,624 --> 00:12:08,559
# He said he's not to be disturbed #

97
00:12:08,627 --> 00:12:11,391
# Not even if Winchell phoned #

98
00:12:12,631 --> 00:12:16,397
#This may cause a crash
and quite an international mess #

99
00:12:16,469 --> 00:12:20,166
#And tell him he's aggravated
the Associated Press #

100
00:12:20,239 --> 00:12:26,007
#We offer our apologies
but again we have to say #

101
00:12:26,078 --> 00:12:28,103
#We know #

102
00:12:28,180 --> 00:12:31,343
#The baron is #

103
00:12:31,417 --> 00:12:36,445
# In conference #

104
00:12:36,522 --> 00:12:39,423
#And he can't be seen today
Come tomorrow #

105
00:12:39,492 --> 00:12:41,790
# He can't #

106
00:12:41,861 --> 00:12:44,455
# Be seen #

107
00:12:44,530 --> 00:12:49,092
# He can't be seen today #

108
00:12:49,168 --> 00:12:49,769
- # He's busy ##

109
00:12:49,769 --> 00:12:50,326
- # He's busy ##

110
00:13:05,951 --> 00:13:09,114
#This meeting is called to order #

111
00:13:09,188 --> 00:13:12,021
#To discuss the business of the day #

112
00:13:12,091 --> 00:13:15,288
# Old business #

113
00:13:15,361 --> 00:13:17,625
# New business #

114
00:13:17,696 --> 00:13:21,723
- ##And you, my dear ##
- # Unfiinished business #

115
00:13:21,801 --> 00:13:25,066
# Of course
How forgetful of me #

116
00:13:25,137 --> 00:13:28,038
#We'll examine the facts and fiigures #

117
00:13:28,107 --> 00:13:30,200
Figures?

118
00:13:31,777 --> 00:13:34,803
#You balance your budgets very fiine #

119
00:13:34,880 --> 00:13:39,146
- Shee!
- ##So, stockholders of my affection ##

120
00:13:39,218 --> 00:13:43,154
##As your chairman
I never will resign ##

121
00:13:43,222 --> 00:13:45,213
# Long ''love'' the president #

122
00:13:45,291 --> 00:13:49,557
# Our romantic enterprise
quite successfully has fared #

123
00:13:49,628 --> 00:13:53,860
#All your wishes will be granted
and a dividend declared #

124
00:13:53,933 --> 00:13:57,892
# Dividendo, dividendo
Bravo, bravo, hooray #

125
00:13:57,970 --> 00:14:01,406
# My moment with you is over #

126
00:14:01,473 --> 00:14:04,601
#We're through with
the business of the day #

127
00:14:04,677 --> 00:14:09,080
##And now, my lovely senhoritas ##

128
00:14:09,148 --> 00:14:14,415
- # Please permit me to say #

129
00:14:14,486 --> 00:14:20,391
# Boa noite, night is done #

130
00:14:20,459 --> 00:14:22,893
# So good night #

131
00:14:22,962 --> 00:14:27,023
- # My lovely one #

132
00:14:27,099 --> 00:14:33,231
# Soon every star will be an ember #

133
00:14:33,305 --> 00:14:36,638
#And this, another kiss #

134
00:14:36,709 --> 00:14:41,580
#That we'll remember #

135
00:14:41,713 --> 00:14:47,618
# Boa noite, lady fair #

136
00:14:47,686 --> 00:14:53,921
- # Soon I'll dream and you'll be there #

137
00:14:53,992 --> 00:14:59,828
#Where I can hold you
in my arms again #

138
00:14:59,898 --> 00:15:04,494
# So boa noite until then #

139
00:15:04,569 --> 00:15:09,973
# Boa noite, night is through #

140
00:15:10,041 --> 00:15:16,412
- # Soon I'll dream and when I do #
- #And when I do #

141
00:15:16,481 --> 00:15:22,351
# I'll dream my way
into your arms again #

142
00:15:22,420 --> 00:15:29,121
# So boa noite until #

143
00:15:29,194 --> 00:15:34,188
#This is such a wonderful delight #

144
00:15:34,265 --> 00:15:38,429
#The baron is in conference #

145
00:15:38,503 --> 00:15:41,199
#And he can't be seen #

146
00:15:41,272 --> 00:15:43,263
Shh.
#Tonight ##

147
00:15:57,455 --> 00:16:00,185
Why, it's incredible.

148
00:16:00,258 --> 00:16:02,317
You have very articulate eyes,
Cecilia.

149
00:16:03,561 --> 00:16:06,291
Like your conscience, Manuel?

150
00:16:06,364 --> 00:16:10,528
You must make some allowance
for the exaggerations of an artist.

151
00:16:10,602 --> 00:16:14,470
- How much allowance?
- I leave that to your generous
North American heart.

152
00:16:14,539 --> 00:16:18,305
Oh, you're quite modest, Manuel.

153
00:16:18,376 --> 00:16:21,868
As a matter of fact, I thought
the impersonation quite remarkable.

154
00:16:21,946 --> 00:16:25,905
Hmm, I'm afraid
I should not have come.

155
00:16:25,984 --> 00:16:30,045
I shall never get used
to thinking of myself as a Lothario.

156
00:16:30,121 --> 00:16:32,248
If I hadn't seen it,
I wouldn't have believed it.

157
00:16:32,323 --> 00:16:35,315
Pierre, perhaps a little game
of baccarat in the gaming room?

158
00:16:35,393 --> 00:16:38,920
- Delighted, my dear Cecilia!
You will excuse us, Baron?
- Of course, of course.

159
00:16:38,997 --> 00:16:41,727
Gentlemen.

160
00:16:43,668 --> 00:16:47,695
Baron Duarte, I trust Senhor Martin's
act did not offend you.

161
00:16:47,772 --> 00:16:50,741
Oh, no, no, no. Not at all.
On the contrary, I enjoyed it immensely.

162
00:16:50,809 --> 00:16:53,539
I should like to have the honor
of meeting the gentleman sometime.

163
00:16:53,611 --> 00:16:56,512
Perhaps I could give him
a few suggestions.

164
00:16:56,581 --> 00:16:58,947
Or perhaps he could give me some.

165
00:16:59,017 --> 00:17:01,918
- Would you like to come backstage now?
- Why not?

166
00:17:01,986 --> 00:17:05,251
If you'll excuse me,
I shall be back presently.

167
00:17:16,301 --> 00:17:19,464
My dear Inez, how charming
to see you again after all these months.

168
00:17:19,537 --> 00:17:21,630
- Baron Duarte?
- At your service.

169
00:17:21,706 --> 00:17:24,641
- I didn't think you would remember me.
- Oh, remember you?

170
00:17:24,709 --> 00:17:29,737
How could I forget?
Your-Your esprit, your joie de vivre.

171
00:17:29,814 --> 00:17:32,112
The auburn waves of your hair.

172
00:17:32,183 --> 00:17:34,208
But I was a brunette then.

173
00:17:34,285 --> 00:17:37,448
Well, it must have been the moonlight
in your hair which deceived me.

174
00:17:37,522 --> 00:17:40,082
We dined together on the terrace,
you remember, in Pernambuco.

175
00:17:40,158 --> 00:17:43,924
- Oh, I recall every moment
of it vividly. We had dinner.
- Yes?

176
00:17:43,995 --> 00:17:47,658
If I seemed a little, eh,
shall we say, distraught...

177
00:17:47,732 --> 00:17:50,462
it was because
I realized the futility...

178
00:17:50,535 --> 00:17:53,595
of trying to express my feelings
for you in mere words.

179
00:17:53,671 --> 00:17:57,300
- I must go now. Why don't you-
- Why, perhaps sometime
you might do me the honor...

180
00:17:57,375 --> 00:18:00,105
of making Rio as exciting
as Pernambuco, eh?

181
00:18:00,178 --> 00:18:02,806
Pernambuco, eh?

182
00:18:02,881 --> 00:18:05,611
- So you go there to fiish, huh?
- But l-

183
00:18:05,683 --> 00:18:09,312
Well, I think you-you-

184
00:18:15,527 --> 00:18:18,758
Oh, Baron Duarte.

185
00:18:18,830 --> 00:18:21,526
Pardon me.
L- I do not know what to say.

186
00:18:21,599 --> 00:18:24,261
Please say that you forgive me.

187
00:18:24,335 --> 00:18:27,031
- Forgive you? For what?
- For having upset you.

188
00:18:27,105 --> 00:18:29,198
I thought you was Larry-
Senhor Martin.

189
00:18:29,274 --> 00:18:31,936
Oh, how I envy Senhor Martin.

190
00:18:32,010 --> 00:18:35,605
I wish I could arouse such violent
emotions in so beautiful a woman.

191
00:18:35,680 --> 00:18:38,649
Mmm, I have heard about you, Baron.

192
00:18:38,716 --> 00:18:40,809
You do not do so bad yourself, huh?

193
00:18:40,885 --> 00:18:44,514
What a charming smile.
It makes me want to do better.

194
00:18:44,589 --> 00:18:47,854
Perhaps you-you might do me
the honor to have supper with me.

195
00:18:47,926 --> 00:18:52,226
- You are making love to me?
- Oh, what a charming notion.

196
00:18:52,297 --> 00:18:55,528
- Ah.
- I must say it appeals to me too. Will you?

197
00:18:55,600 --> 00:18:58,831
- No.
- I am very sorry.

198
00:18:58,903 --> 00:19:01,235
- Tomorrow perhaps?
- I am very sorry.

199
00:19:01,306 --> 00:19:03,331
We are-
We are both very sorry.

200
00:19:03,408 --> 00:19:06,343
Perhaps we could discuss our regrets
together over a bottle of champagne.

201
00:19:06,411 --> 00:19:09,574
- Oh, no, no, no. No champagne.
- All right. You will choose the wine.

202
00:19:09,647 --> 00:19:12,878
Tomorrow night,
I am having a reception for-

203
00:19:12,951 --> 00:19:15,715
for a distinguished foreign
diplomat, an ambassador.

204
00:19:15,787 --> 00:19:18,984
Perhaps you will sing for us?
Later on, we might fiind a moment or two...

205
00:19:19,057 --> 00:19:21,582
- for an exchange of ideas, eh?
- No, no, Baron.

206
00:19:21,659 --> 00:19:25,026
No champagne and no ideas.

207
00:19:25,096 --> 00:19:27,656
- You are afraid of the ambassador?
- Oh, no, not the ambassador.

208
00:19:27,732 --> 00:19:29,723
- But won't you come?
- I would like to.

209
00:19:29,801 --> 00:19:32,065
Thank you, thank you.

210
00:19:32,136 --> 00:19:34,229
- L-l-
- But I won't.

211
00:19:35,940 --> 00:19:38,204
But, Cecilia,
you saw for yourself.

212
00:19:38,276 --> 00:19:41,734
Manuel escapades
are public knowledge.

213
00:19:41,813 --> 00:19:44,907
Cecilia, isn't it time
for you to retaliate?

214
00:19:44,983 --> 00:19:47,713
- Oh, I'm afraid I'm not that vengeful.
- But you have a right to-

215
00:19:47,785 --> 00:19:51,346
When I fiind somebody as charming
as my husband, I'll think of my rights.

216
00:19:51,422 --> 00:19:54,220
Stop preening, Pierre.

217
00:19:54,292 --> 00:19:57,693
After all, you really don't think
Manuel could take you seriously?

218
00:19:57,762 --> 00:20:00,094
Cecilia, you're not very flattering.

219
00:20:00,164 --> 00:20:02,758
Many husbands have been
furiously jealous of me.

220
00:20:02,834 --> 00:20:05,769
Well, then, why don't you
rest on your laurels?

221
00:20:05,837 --> 00:20:08,533
Get yourself a wife, Pierre,
and leave me alone, hmm?

222
00:20:08,606 --> 00:20:12,303
Cecilia, if I cannot be happy
with another man's wife...

223
00:20:12,377 --> 00:20:14,777
how can I be happy
with one of my own?

224
00:22:18,236 --> 00:22:23,572
## This song of love begins ##

225
00:22:23,641 --> 00:22:28,510
#The night they met down in Rio #

226
00:22:28,579 --> 00:22:31,070
# In a café by the bay #

227
00:22:31,149 --> 00:22:34,050
#They romanced to #

228
00:22:34,118 --> 00:22:37,576
#A midnight serenade #

229
00:22:37,655 --> 00:22:42,592
##She told him to forget ##

230
00:22:42,660 --> 00:22:47,893
#The night they met down in Rio #

231
00:22:47,965 --> 00:22:53,403
#And there were tears
in her eyes as they danced to #

232
00:22:53,471 --> 00:22:57,430
#A midnight serenade #

233
00:22:59,010 --> 00:23:02,946
# He whispered #

234
00:23:03,014 --> 00:23:07,644
#You must be mine forevermore #

235
00:23:07,718 --> 00:23:10,778
#And then she showed him
someone else's picture #

236
00:23:10,855 --> 00:23:16,316
# In the tiny little locket she wore #

237
00:23:16,394 --> 00:23:21,058
##And so he rode away ##

238
00:23:21,132 --> 00:23:26,126
# But left his heart down in Rio #

239
00:23:26,204 --> 00:23:32,074
#All that remains of their love
are the strains of #

240
00:23:32,143 --> 00:23:36,910
#A midnight serenade #

241
00:23:40,418 --> 00:23:46,323
#All that remains of their love
are the strains of #

242
00:23:47,391 --> 00:23:51,657
#A midnight #

243
00:23:51,729 --> 00:23:57,759
# Serenade ##

244
00:24:01,739 --> 00:24:04,173
And to think you can sing
like that too, Baroness.

245
00:24:04,242 --> 00:24:06,540
Thank you.
Then you know who I am.

246
00:24:06,611 --> 00:24:09,705
Whenever I see a beautiful flower,
I always learn its name.

247
00:24:09,780 --> 00:24:12,010
I wanted to compliment you
on your performance this evening.

248
00:24:12,083 --> 00:24:14,108
- Oh, thanks.
- Oh, pardon me.

249
00:24:14,185 --> 00:24:16,483
- This is Monsieur Pierre Dufond.
- How do you do, monsieur?

250
00:24:16,554 --> 00:24:18,545
- Won't you sit down?
- Hello.

251
00:24:18,623 --> 00:24:20,648
Uh, yeah.
Thanks, thanks.

252
00:24:20,725 --> 00:24:24,957
- I, uh, hope the baron didn't mind.
- No, he enjoyed it immensely.

253
00:24:25,029 --> 00:24:27,725
- Were you nervous?
- What for?

254
00:24:27,798 --> 00:24:29,993
Well, l- I saw you watching the baron.

255
00:24:30,067 --> 00:24:33,161
- Well, maybe you misjudged my gaze.
- Did I?

256
00:24:33,237 --> 00:24:37,367
Yes, you did, Baroness. I tried very hard to look
at the baron, but I couldn't control my eyes.

257
00:24:37,441 --> 00:24:40,410
What could they possibly
have seen from that distance?

258
00:24:40,478 --> 00:24:44,414
Well, they saw a very beautiful woman watching
my performance like scores of others...

259
00:24:44,482 --> 00:24:47,212
daring me to show her something.
Is that right?

260
00:24:47,285 --> 00:24:49,412
Well, we were talking
about what you saw.

261
00:24:49,487 --> 00:24:53,389
- And then-
- Cecilia, it's getting very late.
Manuel will be waiting.

262
00:24:53,457 --> 00:24:56,187
I doubt it.

263
00:24:56,260 --> 00:24:59,058
- And then?
- The longer I looked, the better I felt.

264
00:24:59,130 --> 00:25:02,065
- Would you do something for me?
- It's done.

265
00:25:02,133 --> 00:25:06,365
Would you impersonate the baron? I'd like to
hear you speak as he does when you're yourself.

266
00:25:06,437 --> 00:25:09,964
Oh, well, without the makeup
and the monocle, l-

267
00:25:11,242 --> 00:25:13,335
I've got it.

268
00:25:15,580 --> 00:25:17,844
There is nothing
south of the Caribbean...

269
00:25:17,915 --> 00:25:20,611
or north of it for that matter,
or east or west of it...

270
00:25:20,685 --> 00:25:24,212
that is as lovely
as you are, Cecilia.

271
00:25:24,288 --> 00:25:26,381
Then you know my name?

272
00:25:26,457 --> 00:25:28,550
Oh, you forget
that I am your husband.

273
00:25:28,626 --> 00:25:34,064
And that gives me the right
to hold your lovely hands...

274
00:25:34,131 --> 00:25:36,622
and to kiss your tempting lips.

275
00:25:36,701 --> 00:25:39,568
Oh, you're-
You're very naughty.

276
00:25:39,637 --> 00:25:41,969
Oh, well, I'm sorry, Baroness.

277
00:25:42,039 --> 00:25:45,566
I always get carried away in my roles.
This is a particularly good part.

278
00:25:45,643 --> 00:25:49,204
Cecilia. Cecilia,
we really must go.

279
00:25:49,280 --> 00:25:51,544
- Yes, I think we'd better go.
- Oh.

280
00:25:51,616 --> 00:25:54,551
I hope I've given you some new ideas
to use as the baron.

281
00:25:54,619 --> 00:25:57,213
You've given me some
new ideas to use as Martin.

282
00:25:57,288 --> 00:25:59,279
Thank you.

283
00:25:59,357 --> 00:26:01,348
- Good night.
- Good night.

284
00:26:07,398 --> 00:26:09,923
You, uh, dropped
your purse, darling.

285
00:26:10,001 --> 00:26:12,060
So I did, my love.

286
00:26:27,885 --> 00:26:30,410
Manuel, your secretary just
brought this to the table.

287
00:26:30,488 --> 00:26:33,821
Very important.

288
00:26:45,202 --> 00:26:48,330
But- But you were positive
they were going to renew.

289
00:26:48,406 --> 00:26:51,170
So positive that
I bought 51%% of the stock.

290
00:26:51,242 --> 00:26:54,700
Fifty-one percent?
You invested all of your money?

291
00:26:54,779 --> 00:26:58,681
Oh, no, no, no. I used the bank's money.
I did not have enough of my own.

292
00:26:58,749 --> 00:27:01,309
For the fiirst time in my life,
I have speculated and lost.

293
00:27:01,385 --> 00:27:04,479
As a matter of fact,
I did not regard this as a speculation.

294
00:27:04,555 --> 00:27:06,648
I was as certain as anybody
could be of anything...

295
00:27:06,724 --> 00:27:08,885
in this uncertain world
that Consolidated would renew.

296
00:27:08,959 --> 00:27:11,655
I still cannot understand
why they won't.

297
00:27:11,729 --> 00:27:13,629
Salles, Salles, hey,
control yourself, huh?

298
00:27:13,698 --> 00:27:17,031
I'm sorry. I can't help it.
It's enough to make anybody twitch.

299
00:27:17,101 --> 00:27:20,161
- What will the bank depositors do?
- Let's not think that far-

300
00:27:20,237 --> 00:27:24,230
- Where are you going?
- We need 20 million.
I'm sure I cannot get it here.

301
00:27:24,308 --> 00:27:26,674
This information will not
be made public for 48 hours.

302
00:27:26,744 --> 00:27:29,713
If we can replace the money in the bank
before that time, we're safe.

303
00:27:29,780 --> 00:27:33,216
If not, I will do my best
to exonerate you of all blame.

304
00:27:33,284 --> 00:27:37,380
- Thank heaven, it's only 51%% .
- What a happy thought, Salles.

305
00:27:37,455 --> 00:27:40,583
- We'll see you at the stock
exchange in the morning.
- If this doesn't leak out.

306
00:27:40,658 --> 00:27:43,354
Otherwise, there will be no need
to bother about the stock exchange.

307
00:27:43,427 --> 00:27:46,760
- Prison will be much safer.

308
00:27:49,667 --> 00:27:52,500
- Why don't you see a doctor about that lip?
- I did.

309
00:27:52,570 --> 00:27:56,836
- Well?
- He told me to relax and not to worry.

310
00:28:09,686 --> 00:28:11,779
Twenty-four and a half!

311
00:28:25,835 --> 00:28:29,066
- Where is the baron this morning?
- Good morning, Machado.

312
00:28:29,139 --> 00:28:31,130
The baron?
He's a little late.

313
00:28:31,208 --> 00:28:34,735
- Well, that is very strange.
- Strange? What's strange about that?

314
00:28:34,811 --> 00:28:38,372
As his business competitor, I have known
the baron for a great many years.

315
00:28:38,448 --> 00:28:40,916
He is never late,
especially at the exchange.

316
00:28:40,984 --> 00:28:43,214
Well, there has to be a fiirst time.

317
00:28:43,286 --> 00:28:46,585
- Here. Weren't you ever late yourself?
- Never.

318
00:28:46,656 --> 00:28:48,817
It couldn't be, Penna,
that the baron...

319
00:28:48,892 --> 00:28:51,452
maybe has heard some bad news
about the airmail contract...

320
00:28:51,528 --> 00:28:56,761
- and is trying to pull a few wires, could it?
- You are crazy.

321
00:28:56,833 --> 00:29:02,271
The trouble with you, Machado,
is that you suspect- suspect everybody.

322
00:29:02,339 --> 00:29:05,137
I do. That is why I am
an investment banker.

323
00:29:05,208 --> 00:29:08,177
If I didn't,
I would be just an investor.

324
00:29:16,019 --> 00:29:18,715
Shh.

325
00:29:20,423 --> 00:29:23,187
- I'd like to know what's going on.
- Shh. Don't whisper.

326
00:29:23,260 --> 00:29:25,490
- What's the matter?

327
00:29:25,562 --> 00:29:27,860
Don't whisper, I told you,
and don't twitch.

328
00:29:29,532 --> 00:29:31,625
I think Machado
suspects something.

329
00:29:31,701 --> 00:29:33,794
If he gets the idea
that anything is wrong...

330
00:29:33,870 --> 00:29:35,997
he will start selling
his airline stock short.

331
00:29:36,072 --> 00:29:39,633
And the bank will discover our shortage
before the morning is over.

332
00:29:39,709 --> 00:29:44,305
Then we can take our 51%% and light
our cigars with it- if we have any cigars.

333
00:29:44,381 --> 00:29:46,474
Now, smile.

334
00:29:46,549 --> 00:29:50,918
Turn around, you fool!

335
00:29:54,457 --> 00:29:57,392
Now, what were you going to say?

336
00:29:57,460 --> 00:30:01,226
- Manuel is not at the bank.
- That's fiine.

337
00:30:01,298 --> 00:30:03,926
Just when we need him,
he disappears.

338
00:30:05,235 --> 00:30:07,499
- He's probably still at home.

339
00:30:07,570 --> 00:30:12,007
We've got to get him.
We will just ease out of the place...

340
00:30:12,075 --> 00:30:16,034
as if we hadn't a care in the world.

341
00:30:16,112 --> 00:30:18,137
We've got to get Manuel over here...

342
00:30:18,214 --> 00:30:21,980
or that scoundrel Machado
will start asking more questions.

343
00:30:22,052 --> 00:30:24,543
What if he isn't home either?

344
00:30:24,621 --> 00:30:29,217
Don't blow up your bridges
till you come to them.

345
00:30:29,292 --> 00:30:32,591
You fool.

346
00:30:57,320 --> 00:31:00,551
- Where is he?
- Offhand, I should say he's not here, senhor.

347
00:31:00,623 --> 00:31:02,853
Where-Where's the baroness?
Maybe she will know.

348
00:31:02,926 --> 00:31:05,019
The baroness is out riding, senhor.

349
00:31:05,095 --> 00:31:07,154
- Arthur.
- What?

350
00:31:12,435 --> 00:31:14,903
He- He left a letter for you.

351
00:31:17,941 --> 00:31:20,000
No, no, no.

352
00:31:23,179 --> 00:31:25,943
- That will be all, Pedro.

353
00:31:35,492 --> 00:31:38,154
''My dear Arthur,
I failed last night...

354
00:31:38,228 --> 00:31:41,595
''to get any help from the men
on whom I had counted.

355
00:31:41,664 --> 00:31:46,829
''I've only one hope left- the City Bank of
Buenos Aires. I am leaving at once by plane...

356
00:31:46,903 --> 00:31:50,600
and if I... don't succeed,
you will not see me again.''

357
00:31:50,673 --> 00:31:52,766
He- He's going to kill himself.

358
00:31:52,842 --> 00:31:56,903
''Don't worry.
I am not going to kill myself.

359
00:31:56,980 --> 00:32:01,280
''But I won't return until I can pay back
every penny to our depositors.

360
00:32:01,351 --> 00:32:05,344
''Remember, until this is settled
one way or the other, no one must know.

361
00:32:05,422 --> 00:32:07,515
''Now, courage and don't worry.

362
00:32:07,590 --> 00:32:10,320
Yours as always''-
As always-

363
00:32:10,393 --> 00:32:13,089
I can't read it.
''Manuel. Manuel.''

364
00:32:15,198 --> 00:32:17,792
What are we going to do now?

365
00:32:17,867 --> 00:32:21,769
We've got to keep people from
becoming suspicious, especially Machado.

366
00:32:21,838 --> 00:32:25,604
That's the only thing we can do
until we hear from Manuel.

367
00:32:28,278 --> 00:32:31,839
Shee! I'd forgotten all-
all about the reception.

368
00:32:31,915 --> 00:32:34,213
- What reception?
- For the ambassador.

369
00:32:34,284 --> 00:32:37,447
And Manuel is in Buenos Aires.
We are fiinished.

370
00:32:37,520 --> 00:32:41,684
We've got to get him back. If he's not here
tonight, everybody will suspect.

371
00:32:41,758 --> 00:32:43,851
And he tells us not to worry.

372
00:32:45,261 --> 00:32:47,456
The baroness
is not at home, senhor.

373
00:32:47,530 --> 00:32:51,899
Oh, that's too bad. Uh, you're not
giving me the runaround, are you?

374
00:32:51,968 --> 00:32:55,836
- You're sure she's not in?
- The baroness is horseback riding, senhor.

375
00:32:55,905 --> 00:32:57,998
Is there something you want?

376
00:32:58,074 --> 00:33:01,202
Yeah, yeah, I...
wanted to give her this.

377
00:33:01,277 --> 00:33:03,905
She left it
at the Samba last night.

378
00:33:03,980 --> 00:33:07,416
Well, here it is.

379
00:33:07,484 --> 00:33:09,816
Say good morning to the baroness
for me, will you? Thanks.

380
00:33:09,886 --> 00:33:11,877
Who shall I say called, senhor?

381
00:33:11,955 --> 00:33:16,551
- My name is Larry Martin.
- Are you thinking what I'm thinking?

382
00:33:16,626 --> 00:33:20,756
- But what if we get caught?
- A few more years in jail
won't make any difference.

383
00:33:20,830 --> 00:33:22,821
Senhor Martin.
Come in.

384
00:33:24,667 --> 00:33:28,068
Then at the reception,
you just act charming and gracious.

385
00:33:28,137 --> 00:33:31,163
- My natural self, huh?
- Now, there are a few things you must learn.

386
00:33:31,241 --> 00:33:34,267
- Your wife's name is Cecilia.
- Yeah, beautiful name, isn't it?

387
00:33:34,344 --> 00:33:38,178
That's beside the point. Your valet
is Pedro, and the chauffeur is Oswaldo.

388
00:33:38,248 --> 00:33:41,183
- Beautiful.
- If you think Pedro is beautiful,
that's your affair.

389
00:33:41,251 --> 00:33:44,618
- The chef is ''Austregesilo.''
- Austregésilo.

390
00:33:44,687 --> 00:33:46,882
- ''Gésilo.''
- The maid is Luiza.

391
00:33:46,956 --> 00:33:49,424
- She's very pretty and a trifle forward.
- How far forward?

392
00:33:49,492 --> 00:33:52,222
Sometimes you joke with her, and
sometimes you pinch her on the cheek.

393
00:33:52,295 --> 00:33:55,025
- Oh, it depends on my mood, huh?
- Your name is Manuel.

394
00:33:55,098 --> 00:33:57,464
- Can you remember all that?
- It's my business. I'm an actor.

395
00:33:57,534 --> 00:34:00,128
My na-
My name is Manuel.

396
00:34:00,203 --> 00:34:03,434
My wife's name is Cecilia.
You two are Felicio and Arthur.

397
00:34:03,506 --> 00:34:05,599
My valet is Pedro.
The chef, Austregésilo.

398
00:34:05,675 --> 00:34:07,700
The chauffeur, Oswaldo.
The maid, Luiza.

399
00:34:07,777 --> 00:34:11,269
Sometimes I joke with her.
Sometimes I pinch her on the... cheek.

400
00:34:11,347 --> 00:34:13,645
Now I want half my money
before I start the job.

401
00:34:13,716 --> 00:34:15,741
I closed my eyes.
It's perfect.

402
00:34:15,818 --> 00:34:18,946
- I couldn't tell the difference.
- Wait till you hear it when I get my money.

403
00:34:19,022 --> 00:34:23,118
- Please. Here you are. Nine, 10.
- Yeah.

404
00:34:23,192 --> 00:34:26,423
Now, the fiirst thing we must do
is tell the baroness.

405
00:34:26,496 --> 00:34:30,227
- No- Oh, no. You tell her, and it's no go.
- Well, but listen-

406
00:34:30,300 --> 00:34:32,996
No, no, no, no, no. Don't you see?
I'd get stage fright.

407
00:34:33,069 --> 00:34:37,062
- I'd give a bad performance.
- All right, all right. We won't tell the baroness.

408
00:34:37,140 --> 00:34:41,474
- Come, come. This door leads to your bedroom.
- Yeah?

409
00:34:41,544 --> 00:34:45,105
- And this is your wardrobe.
That leads to the bath.
- Yeah?

410
00:34:45,181 --> 00:34:47,741
And that, of course,
is the hall door.

411
00:34:47,817 --> 00:34:50,945
- Where does this door lead to?
- Eh, that leads to the baroness's room.

412
00:34:51,020 --> 00:34:54,979
That's another thing. Listen, you are
on very formal terms with your wife-

413
00:34:55,058 --> 00:34:57,117
always polite and courteous.

414
00:34:57,193 --> 00:34:59,684
- But it ends there.
- We're not bad friends, are we?

415
00:34:59,762 --> 00:35:02,925
Oh, no. You and the baroness
have a perfect understanding.

416
00:35:02,999 --> 00:35:04,990
You each go your own way.

417
00:35:05,068 --> 00:35:07,161
It's a simple, modern marriage.

418
00:35:23,620 --> 00:35:26,646
Is that all we do here,
just, uh, stand around and grin?

419
00:35:26,723 --> 00:35:29,317
That's all,
and that's hard enough.

420
00:35:29,392 --> 00:35:31,553
You buy nothing.
You sell nothing.

421
00:35:31,628 --> 00:35:36,031
- Same thing happens every day?
- Yes, that's the way they
do business on the exchange.

422
00:35:41,204 --> 00:35:45,231
There's Machado,
staring at us.

423
00:35:45,308 --> 00:35:47,572
- Machado who?
- Laughing, laughing.

424
00:35:50,079 --> 00:35:53,139
You know, boys. This kind of fascinates me.
Confiidentially, how does it work out?

425
00:35:53,216 --> 00:35:57,346
We are losing our mood.
Smile, smile.

426
00:35:57,420 --> 00:36:00,355
You're wanted at the bank
at once, senhor.

427
00:36:00,423 --> 00:36:03,551
- The bank?
- Yes, senhor.

428
00:36:03,626 --> 00:36:05,821
Boys, boys,
you're out of character.

429
00:36:08,798 --> 00:36:11,528
- I'd better wait here.
- No, no, no, no.

430
00:36:11,601 --> 00:36:15,367
- You will come along.
You are in this as much as I.
- Uh-huh.

431
00:36:15,438 --> 00:36:18,566
You stay here, senhor. You must keep up
an appearance at all costs.

432
00:36:18,641 --> 00:36:21,269
Uh, look, what do I do
while you're gone, huh?

433
00:36:21,344 --> 00:36:23,608
Nothing, nothing.
Absolutely nothing.

434
00:36:23,680 --> 00:36:26,274
You buy nothing.
You sell nothing. You say nothing.

435
00:36:26,349 --> 00:36:29,182
Not a word to anybody.

436
00:36:29,252 --> 00:36:31,243
- Understand?
- Oh, perfectly.

437
00:36:31,320 --> 00:36:33,311
Come.

438
00:36:50,840 --> 00:36:53,138
Look, Machado is selling
his airline stock.

439
00:36:53,209 --> 00:36:57,646
He must have heard something about
the airmail contract. That's what it is.

440
00:36:59,215 --> 00:37:02,378
Look, the baron
just bought 10,000 shares.

441
00:37:02,452 --> 00:37:04,511
10,000?

442
00:37:38,755 --> 00:37:42,350
- What a relief.
- Just think of sending for us
about a trifling matter...

443
00:37:42,425 --> 00:37:45,622
the manager could have
attended to himself.

444
00:37:45,695 --> 00:37:48,528
He has no initiative,
that fellow.

445
00:37:52,034 --> 00:37:55,993
Say, uh, who's that
fella down there?

446
00:37:56,072 --> 00:37:58,438
Him? One of the traders.

447
00:37:58,508 --> 00:38:02,035
- Am I supposed to know him?
- You have probably seen him around.

448
00:38:02,111 --> 00:38:06,104
I was just wondering.
He kept waving at me. Friendly fella.

449
00:38:06,182 --> 00:38:08,946
- And what did you do?
- Why, I waved back at him naturally.

450
00:38:09,018 --> 00:38:12,545
I'm taking no chances
with any of these birds around here.

451
00:38:12,622 --> 00:38:15,557
Baron, your purchase.
Thank you, Baron.

452
00:38:18,194 --> 00:38:21,960
- You waved back? You-
- Shh.

453
00:38:22,031 --> 00:38:26,161
You waved back?
You just bought 50,000 shares of stock...

454
00:38:26,235 --> 00:38:29,671
which by tomorrow
probably will be worthless.

455
00:38:29,739 --> 00:38:31,798
That's what you did.

456
00:38:33,476 --> 00:38:35,808
Don't forget, gentlemen, smile.

457
00:38:50,725 --> 00:38:55,492
- How do I look, Pedro?
- Like yourself, senhor. What else?

458
00:38:55,563 --> 00:38:58,361
It's best to be sure.

459
00:38:58,433 --> 00:39:01,561
Please, Cecilia.
Please let him think you don't know.

460
00:39:01,636 --> 00:39:05,072
Our futures,
our lives depend upon it.

461
00:39:15,116 --> 00:39:17,550
No. No, I won't do it.

462
00:39:17,619 --> 00:39:20,281
If you don't, it's the end
of everything for Manuel.

463
00:39:23,458 --> 00:39:25,449
Good evening, Cecilia.

464
00:39:25,527 --> 00:39:29,588
Good evening- Manuel.

465
00:39:29,664 --> 00:39:31,859
- And how are you gentlemen this evening?
- Splendid.

466
00:39:31,933 --> 00:39:34,128
Oh, it's- it's a glorious night.

467
00:39:35,336 --> 00:39:37,327
Happy anniversary, my dear.

468
00:39:39,207 --> 00:39:41,937
Why, what's the matter, darling?

469
00:39:42,010 --> 00:39:45,810
Oh, I'm so surprised
that you remembered.

470
00:39:45,880 --> 00:39:48,872
Our anniversary?
How could I forget?

471
00:39:48,950 --> 00:39:52,613
Perhaps the same way you forgot
last year and the year before.

472
00:39:52,687 --> 00:39:54,882
Last year?

473
00:39:54,956 --> 00:39:58,915
Oh, well, l-I have not been
myself for the past two years.

474
00:39:58,993 --> 00:40:02,554
Are you quite
yourself now, Manuel?

475
00:40:03,798 --> 00:40:05,823
Oh, yes. Quite, quite.

476
00:40:05,900 --> 00:40:10,837
I'm sure you've been overworked.
My poor Manuel.

477
00:40:14,342 --> 00:40:17,869
Oh. Oh, it's exquisite.

478
00:40:19,347 --> 00:40:21,406
Oh.

479
00:40:24,719 --> 00:40:26,744
How did you know
about the anniversary?

480
00:40:26,821 --> 00:40:29,517
Pedro told me. I thought the necklace
was the least I could do.

481
00:40:29,591 --> 00:40:33,027
- Well, uh, you don't expect us
to reimburse you for it, huh?
- I don't.

482
00:40:33,094 --> 00:40:35,187
- That's fiine.
- I charged it to the baron already.

483
00:40:35,263 --> 00:40:37,788
- It looks very expensive.
- It must've cost 10,000.

484
00:40:37,866 --> 00:40:40,960
- No, mon dieu. Twenty.
- Shee.

485
00:40:45,607 --> 00:40:47,666
How does it look, Manuel?

486
00:40:49,611 --> 00:40:53,172
I think it's the most beautiful thing I've ever seen.

487
00:40:53,248 --> 00:40:55,614
It is not the most beautiful
thing I have ever seen.

488
00:40:55,683 --> 00:41:00,177
You know, Cecilia,
this is my anniversary too.

489
00:41:02,957 --> 00:41:05,482
Isn't it?

490
00:41:17,305 --> 00:41:20,138
I think I'd better go see
if everything's ready in the garden.

491
00:41:20,208 --> 00:41:23,336
Excu- Excuse me.

492
00:41:23,411 --> 00:41:27,472
- We expect you to behave like a gentleman.
- Defiinitely.

493
00:41:27,549 --> 00:41:30,040
Whatever you say, gentlemen.
I was giving an inspired performance.

494
00:41:30,118 --> 00:41:34,282
But if you want a run-of-the-mill,
it's okay by me.

495
00:41:36,090 --> 00:41:38,490
Shee.

496
00:42:00,081 --> 00:42:03,847
- You fiinished now?

497
00:42:03,918 --> 00:42:06,079
- And he's still not here.
- He can't be here tonight.

498
00:42:06,154 --> 00:42:09,920
- He called the manager. He got laryngitis.
- Laryngitis-What means that?

499
00:42:09,991 --> 00:42:13,119
- That means he's out with another woman.
- That's a lie!

500
00:42:13,194 --> 00:42:15,424
Sure, he is.

501
00:42:15,496 --> 00:42:18,363
- Where lives Baron Duarte?
- Why?

502
00:42:18,433 --> 00:42:22,597
- Where?
- In the white house near the praça. Why?

503
00:42:22,670 --> 00:42:25,605
You're not going to see the baron?
They will throw you out.

504
00:42:25,673 --> 00:42:27,732
- You think so, huh?
- What else?

505
00:42:27,809 --> 00:42:32,269
Well, you see that? He invite me to come.
See? He beg me on his knees.

506
00:42:32,347 --> 00:42:34,747
No, no. No, you don't go.

507
00:42:34,816 --> 00:42:37,944
You love your Larry too much.
You wouldn't even look at another man.

508
00:42:38,019 --> 00:42:40,487
You think so?
I show you.

509
00:42:40,555 --> 00:42:45,151
- You're really going?
- Tonight, I get for myself some laryngitis.

510
00:43:12,220 --> 00:43:15,781
- Welcome, Your Excellency.
- I'm delighted to see you, my dear Baron.

511
00:43:15,857 --> 00:43:18,155
This is indeed a great honor,
Your Excellency.

512
00:43:18,226 --> 00:43:21,354
The greatest honor that has
ever been bestowed upon me.

513
00:43:21,429 --> 00:43:26,025
To think that a man of your position
would deign to set foot in my humble house.

514
00:43:26,100 --> 00:43:30,036
Why, Manuel, one would think
His Excellency had never visited us before.

515
00:43:31,105 --> 00:43:34,597
Ah. It seems that each time...

516
00:43:34,676 --> 00:43:36,974
l-I am overwhelmed
all over again.

517
00:43:37,045 --> 00:43:39,980
It is just like seeing
a great actor-

518
00:43:40,048 --> 00:43:41,845
always different,
yet always the same.

519
00:43:41,916 --> 00:43:44,009
You're much too kind, my dear Baron.

520
00:43:44,085 --> 00:43:47,111
I'm afraid you would sound
much more convincing...

521
00:43:47,188 --> 00:43:52,387
if you didn't have so lovely
a wife to console you while I'm away.

522
00:43:54,696 --> 00:43:57,221
Baron, well, at last
I've caught up with you.

523
00:43:57,298 --> 00:44:01,325
I've been trying to talk with you all day,
but you have acted so strange that-

524
00:44:01,402 --> 00:44:04,667
Hello, Machado.
How are you?

525
00:44:04,739 --> 00:44:08,334
- Fancy seeing you here, of all people.
- Yes, yes. Thank you, Salles.

526
00:44:08,409 --> 00:44:10,502
- Salles, please. L-

527
00:44:10,578 --> 00:44:14,207
I'm trying... to talk
to the baron, please.

528
00:44:14,282 --> 00:44:18,048
I know you, you old devil.
You've got as keen an eye for the girls...

529
00:44:18,119 --> 00:44:20,212
as any blade in Rio.

530
00:44:20,288 --> 00:44:23,314
- Come, come. I'll show you a beautiful girl.
- No, no. I want no girl.

531
00:44:23,391 --> 00:44:27,350
Oh, so that's the fellow
I'm not supposed to talk to, huh?

532
00:44:27,428 --> 00:44:32,024
Not one word. And whatever you do,
don't let him get you alone.

533
00:44:32,100 --> 00:44:35,661
Don't worry. I'm gonna devote the rest
of the evening exclusively to my wife.

534
00:44:35,737 --> 00:44:40,731
Excuse me, senhor.
May I speak to you alone?

535
00:44:40,808 --> 00:44:44,505
There's a young lady to see you, senhor.
I showed her into the library.

536
00:44:44,579 --> 00:44:47,275
Oh, no. I don't want to see
any young ladies. Send her away.

537
00:44:47,348 --> 00:44:50,715
But that's easier said than done, senhor.
She's quite persistent.

538
00:44:50,785 --> 00:44:55,356
And she might make a most unpleasant scene.
If I might suggest, senhor...

539
00:44:55,489 --> 00:44:58,049
- you are so adept in such matters-
- How do you know?

540
00:44:58,125 --> 00:45:00,923
Oh, I am.
Yes, of course. I am.

541
00:45:00,994 --> 00:45:05,226
I have never been in the service
of any gentleman who could...

542
00:45:05,299 --> 00:45:08,200
handle them so easily,
coming or going.

543
00:45:08,268 --> 00:45:11,135
Oh, I'm quite a fellow, huh?

544
00:45:11,205 --> 00:45:13,935
All right, I will see her.
I suppose that's part of the job.

545
00:45:14,007 --> 00:45:17,374
Oh, hardly a job, senhor.
A pleasure.

546
00:45:17,444 --> 00:45:20,971
- The young lady is most... engaging.
- Oh.

547
00:45:30,858 --> 00:45:34,055
- Carmen!
- You are surprised I am here, Baron?

548
00:45:38,465 --> 00:45:43,835
Oh, yes. Surprised
and delighted, senhorita.

549
00:45:43,904 --> 00:45:46,338
As a matter of fact,
my dear Carmen...

550
00:45:46,407 --> 00:45:51,071
I did not expect to see you again under-
under such delightful circumstances.

551
00:45:51,145 --> 00:45:55,980
I thought you were too much in love
with this charming American fellow, Martin.

552
00:45:56,049 --> 00:45:58,483
And I cannot say that I blame you.

553
00:45:58,552 --> 00:46:01,612
Oh, he is so handsome, so gifted...

554
00:46:01,688 --> 00:46:04,088
- so-
- So big ugly pig.

555
00:46:04,158 --> 00:46:07,093
Oh, really?

556
00:46:07,161 --> 00:46:11,655
Well, when a woman talks so-
so viciously about a man...

557
00:46:11,732 --> 00:46:14,530
it can be for one reason:
She loves him.

558
00:46:14,601 --> 00:46:17,502
Well, I am here, no?

559
00:46:22,843 --> 00:46:28,338
Ah, I was right. You are still thinking
about your Larry, eh?

560
00:46:28,415 --> 00:46:30,440
Bah! That ham.

561
00:46:36,423 --> 00:46:39,358
Oh, yes. Yes, you are.

562
00:46:39,426 --> 00:46:44,022
I felt it when I kissed you. I actually felt
Martin in your arms when I held you in mine.

563
00:46:44,097 --> 00:46:46,395
No, no, no, no. Do not worry.
I am not offended.

564
00:46:46,467 --> 00:46:49,868
On the contrary, I like to see
a woman in love with one man.

565
00:46:49,937 --> 00:46:52,838
Oh, it is so rare, so exciting.

566
00:46:52,906 --> 00:46:55,033
Love him?
I hate him.

567
00:46:55,108 --> 00:46:57,736
I do not come here
to talk about him.

568
00:46:57,811 --> 00:47:00,336
I come here to talk...

569
00:47:00,414 --> 00:47:02,507
about you.

570
00:47:02,583 --> 00:47:06,075
Oh, you make me very happy
when you say that, Carmen.

571
00:47:06,153 --> 00:47:08,883
Please.

572
00:47:08,956 --> 00:47:12,050
Mmm, you are wonderful, Carmen.

573
00:47:12,125 --> 00:47:17,358
I love you. Never have I known
anybody like you. Never, Carmen.

574
00:47:17,431 --> 00:47:21,390
You are right.
That Martin is a ham-

575
00:47:21,468 --> 00:47:25,370
a cheap, common, vulgar,
nightclub clown.

576
00:47:25,439 --> 00:47:28,840
Oh, what a terrible life
he must have led you.

577
00:47:28,909 --> 00:47:33,437
But why do you talk about him
when we are here together?

578
00:47:33,514 --> 00:47:39,419
- Well, does that mean-
- It means, kiss me. And kiss me, kiss me, Baron.

579
00:47:42,089 --> 00:47:44,114
Close your eyes, and I will kiss you...

580
00:47:44,191 --> 00:47:48,753
like you have never been kissed before.

581
00:47:48,829 --> 00:47:52,424
You're lying. You thought I was the baron.

582
00:47:58,972 --> 00:48:01,702
All right, all right.
So you knew who I was.

583
00:48:01,775 --> 00:48:05,108
- But what did you come here
for in the fiirst place?

584
00:48:05,178 --> 00:48:07,408
That's a fiine question.
You know what I'm doing here.

585
00:48:07,481 --> 00:48:09,472
I'm impersonating the baron.
That's what I'm doing.

586
00:48:09,550 --> 00:48:11,643
What for, his wife?

587
00:48:11,718 --> 00:48:14,448
Oh, well, now,
that's a nice question, isn't it?

588
00:48:14,521 --> 00:48:17,957
And about a charming lady like that.
You ought to be ashamed of yourself.

589
00:48:18,025 --> 00:48:20,960
That's the thanks I get. Here I am,
breaking my back in this makeup...

590
00:48:21,028 --> 00:48:24,156
trying to make a little extra dough
to buy you a fur rag, and you-

591
00:48:24,231 --> 00:48:28,964
For me? Oh, Larry,
I am so sorry.

592
00:48:29,036 --> 00:48:32,335
- What? Again?
- You forgive me?

593
00:48:32,406 --> 00:48:35,398
Well, after this, don't go around
thinking things that make even me blush.

594
00:48:35,475 --> 00:48:38,410
Oh, I will be so good.

595
00:48:38,478 --> 00:48:40,605
Yeah, I bet you will.

596
00:48:40,681 --> 00:48:43,582
- All right, I forgive you.
But this is the last time.

597
00:48:43,650 --> 00:48:46,585
Oh, wait a minute. Wait a minute.

598
00:48:46,653 --> 00:48:49,588
What if somebody should come in here
and see you in the baron's arms?

599
00:48:49,656 --> 00:48:52,250
- Ah, let them worry about that.

600
00:48:52,326 --> 00:48:57,320
But, Cecilia, you've refused to dance
with me at least 10 times this evening.

601
00:48:57,397 --> 00:48:59,991
I insist upon knowing why.

602
00:49:00,067 --> 00:49:03,002
Does the obvious ever become
obvious to you, Pierre?

603
00:49:03,070 --> 00:49:05,868
After all, 10 times
should be convincing.

604
00:49:05,939 --> 00:49:08,169
Besides, I'm having
this dance with my husband.

605
00:49:12,179 --> 00:49:17,207
You run along, baby, and I'll duck
out of here just as soon as I ca-

606
00:49:17,284 --> 00:49:20,879
- You are Senhorita Carmen from the casino?
- Yes, Baronesa.

607
00:49:20,954 --> 00:49:24,947
I invited her
to come here and sing.

608
00:49:25,025 --> 00:49:27,050
Oh, splendid.

609
00:49:27,127 --> 00:49:30,062
But don't forget, Manuel.
We have the next dance together.

610
00:49:30,130 --> 00:49:33,258
Oh, how could I forget it, Cecilia?

611
00:49:34,735 --> 00:49:37,397
Oh, of course.
Of course, yes.

612
00:49:37,471 --> 00:49:39,803
Well, come along then.

613
00:49:46,146 --> 00:49:51,311
Look. When you dance
with her, dance like this.

614
00:49:51,385 --> 00:49:54,752
And no like this.
Understand?

615
00:49:54,821 --> 00:49:57,051
- Nothing could be clearer.
- Yeah.

616
00:50:09,503 --> 00:50:12,370
Baron, uh, may we have a talk now?

617
00:50:12,439 --> 00:50:14,498
Right after this dance.

618
00:51:13,300 --> 00:51:16,167
I think she's beginning to enjoy it.

619
00:51:16,236 --> 00:51:18,670
He's certainly holding her close.

620
00:51:18,739 --> 00:51:23,506
Mm-hmm. It is hard to tell
where he leaves off and she begins.

621
00:54:11,912 --> 00:54:14,005
Why, Manuel.

622
00:54:29,062 --> 00:54:32,793
# I, yi, yi, yi, yi
I like you very much #

623
00:54:32,866 --> 00:54:36,734
# I, yi, yi, yi, yi
I think you're grand #

624
00:54:36,803 --> 00:54:40,295
#Why, why, why is it that
when I feel your touch #

625
00:54:40,373 --> 00:54:44,537
# My heart starts to beat
to beat the band #

626
00:54:44,611 --> 00:54:48,377
# I, yi, yi, yi, yi
I like you to hold me tight #

627
00:54:48,448 --> 00:54:52,214
#You are too, too
too, too, too divine #

628
00:54:52,285 --> 00:54:56,153
# If you want to be
in someone's arms tonight #

629
00:54:56,222 --> 00:54:59,350
#Just be sure the arms
you're in are mine #

630
00:54:59,426 --> 00:55:03,226
# Oh, I like your lips
and I like your eyes #

631
00:55:03,296 --> 00:55:07,824
#You do like my hips
to ''hips-notize'' you, whee #

632
00:55:07,901 --> 00:55:11,667
# See, see, see, see, see, see
See the moon above #

633
00:55:11,738 --> 00:55:15,572
#Way, way, way
way up in the blue #

634
00:55:15,642 --> 00:55:19,510
# Sim, sim, sim, senhor
I think I fall in love #

635
00:55:19,579 --> 00:55:22,673
#And when I fall
I think I fall for you #

636
00:55:26,953 --> 00:55:28,978
# I, yi, yi, yi
Then sim, sim, sim ##

637
00:55:29,055 --> 00:55:31,580
- #That's you for me #
- ##I, yi, yi, yi yi, yi, yi ##

638
00:55:31,658 --> 00:55:35,150
- ## Yi, yi, yi, yi ##
- # I like you very much #

639
00:55:35,228 --> 00:55:39,324
- ##I, yi, yi, yi ##
- # I think you're grand #

640
00:55:39,399 --> 00:55:43,096
#Why, why, why is it that
when I feel your touch #

641
00:55:43,169 --> 00:55:45,694
# My heart starts to beat
to beat the band #

642
00:55:47,941 --> 00:55:51,104
# I, yi, yi, like you
to hold me tight #

643
00:55:51,177 --> 00:55:54,943
#You are too, too
too, too, too divine #

644
00:55:55,015 --> 00:55:58,883
#And if you want to be
in someone's arms tonight #

645
00:55:58,952 --> 00:56:02,080
#Just be sure the arms
you're in are mine #

646
00:56:02,155 --> 00:56:05,955
- # Oh, I like your lips and I like your eyes

647
00:56:06,026 --> 00:56:10,554
#You do like my hips
to ''hips-notize'' you, whee #

648
00:56:10,630 --> 00:56:14,396
# See, see, see, see, see, see
See the moon above #

649
00:56:14,467 --> 00:56:18,301
#Way, way, way
way up in the blue #

650
00:56:18,371 --> 00:56:22,239
# Sim, sim, sim, senhor
I think I fall in love #

651
00:56:22,308 --> 00:56:25,471
#And when I fall
I think I fall for you #

652
00:56:31,851 --> 00:56:34,445
- ##Sim, sim, sim, sim ##
- #That's you for me ##

653
00:56:47,667 --> 00:56:49,897
- Everything is going fiine?
- Sure.

654
00:56:49,969 --> 00:56:53,735
- Better than I expected.
- Mm-hmm.

655
00:56:53,807 --> 00:56:55,866
Ah.

656
00:56:58,378 --> 00:57:01,347
- Good evening, Arthur.
- Good evening.

657
00:57:34,781 --> 00:57:38,877
I tell you, nobody suspects.
He's amazing.

658
00:57:38,952 --> 00:57:41,887
If we hadn't told Cecilia,
she wouldn't have known.

659
00:57:41,955 --> 00:57:44,116
I dare say.

660
00:57:44,190 --> 00:57:46,681
Cecilia has been splendid about it.

661
00:57:46,759 --> 00:57:49,193
Yes, I see.
She's giving full cooperation.

662
00:57:49,262 --> 00:57:54,495
- You are not jealous?
- Oh, of course not, my dear Arthur.

663
00:57:54,567 --> 00:57:59,368
Well, if what you say is true,
I think we're out of danger- fiinancially.

664
00:57:59,439 --> 00:58:01,999
- You got the loan?
- Practically. I will know
defiinitely in the morning.

665
00:58:02,075 --> 00:58:04,168
Shee!

666
00:58:04,244 --> 00:58:06,371
What a relief.
I've been worried to death.

667
00:58:06,446 --> 00:58:09,142
I hope your worries are over
on this score.

668
00:58:09,215 --> 00:58:11,479
The loan comes through
in the morning...

669
00:58:11,551 --> 00:58:16,488
and then that pest Machado can cross-examine
the whole town if he wants to.

670
00:58:16,556 --> 00:58:19,923
Yes. But if he should see
two barons here tonight...

671
00:58:19,993 --> 00:58:22,086
he will start
this cross-examination at once.

672
00:58:22,162 --> 00:58:24,255
We've got to get rid
of Senhor Martin right away.

673
00:58:24,330 --> 00:58:26,230
Leave it to Salles.
He will settle that.

674
00:58:34,941 --> 00:58:37,239
Get out.
The baron is back.

675
00:58:40,513 --> 00:58:43,539
- Excuse me, please?
- Okay.

676
00:59:01,267 --> 00:59:03,258
Hello, Baron.

677
00:59:03,336 --> 00:59:05,361
Hello, Baron.

678
00:59:07,507 --> 00:59:10,533
I had to duck in here, but don't worry.
I'll make it this time.

679
00:59:10,610 --> 00:59:13,807
- Get out. Get out.
- Wait a minute. Let me see if the coast is clear.

680
00:59:15,982 --> 00:59:20,078
Ah! There you are, my dear Machado.

681
00:59:20,153 --> 00:59:22,644
I hope you are enjoying
the party, huh?

682
00:59:22,722 --> 00:59:24,747
Let me in.

683
00:59:24,824 --> 00:59:27,918
- Let me in.

684
00:59:27,994 --> 00:59:30,087
As you have probably
gathered by now, Baron...

685
00:59:30,163 --> 00:59:32,791
I should like
to talk to you- alone.

686
00:59:32,865 --> 00:59:35,163
Certainly, Machado.
Certainly.

687
00:59:37,337 --> 00:59:39,805
Are you sure we cannot
be overheard here?

688
00:59:39,872 --> 00:59:42,739
Well, uh-
No- No one can be sure.

689
00:59:42,809 --> 00:59:45,505
On- On the contrary,
with people running in and out of here...

690
00:59:45,578 --> 00:59:47,944
perhaps I'd better see you
tomorrow in my offiice, say, at 2:00.

691
00:59:48,014 --> 00:59:50,482
No, no. Impossible.
It must be settled tonight.

692
00:59:50,550 --> 00:59:53,451
And inasmuch as it involves
a discussion of your airline holdings...

693
00:59:53,519 --> 00:59:57,216
- it is imperative no one should
hear what I have to say to you.

694
00:59:58,391 --> 01:00:00,450
- What was that?
- Uh, what-what-

695
01:00:00,526 --> 01:00:04,690
- What was what, Machado?
- L- I thought I heard a small pop.

696
01:00:04,764 --> 01:00:08,495
Oh, nonsense. There could not be
any popping here, huh?

697
01:00:08,568 --> 01:00:10,627
All right.
Let's get down to business.

698
01:00:10,703 --> 01:00:14,473
- Perhaps we'd better have a little brandy fiirst.
- Thank you.

699
01:00:18,877 --> 01:00:21,539
Here.
Here you are, Machado.

700
01:00:21,613 --> 01:00:23,877
Baron.

701
01:00:23,949 --> 01:00:27,282
I know my eyes are bad, but
I would swear I saw that screen move.

702
01:00:27,352 --> 01:00:29,877
No, no, no, no.
No, no. That-

703
01:00:29,955 --> 01:00:34,187
That black panther was painted
so that it seems to be moving forward, eh?

704
01:00:34,259 --> 01:00:36,727
I guess maybe it is my eyes.
I'm sorry, Baron.

705
01:00:36,795 --> 01:00:38,888
- Excuse me, Baron. To your health.

706
01:00:38,964 --> 01:00:41,125
Mmm, to yours, Machado.

707
01:00:41,199 --> 01:00:45,067
As time is so valuable,
I will come directly to the point.

708
01:00:45,136 --> 01:00:49,334
I have been watching with keen interest
your handling of your airline.

709
01:00:49,407 --> 01:00:51,466
I know you have made
large investments...

710
01:00:51,543 --> 01:00:53,977
for the modernization
of airports, planes and so forth.

711
01:00:56,748 --> 01:00:59,410
- No-Now, what was that?
- Whoo! Oh! Oh!

712
01:00:59,484 --> 01:01:04,012
- That brandy is strong, hmm?
- No. It came from over there.

713
01:01:04,089 --> 01:01:06,523
- There is someone behind that screen.
- No. N-No, no!

714
01:01:06,591 --> 01:01:08,923
L- I said it. I said-

715
01:01:08,994 --> 01:01:12,361
Uh- Uh, there.
There, you see?

716
01:01:12,430 --> 01:01:15,024
Oh. Well, I am
terribly sorry, Baron...

717
01:01:15,100 --> 01:01:17,660
but l- I don't seem
to be myself tonight.

718
01:01:17,736 --> 01:01:19,829
- Ah.
- Well, let us continue.

719
01:01:19,905 --> 01:01:21,896
Yes.

720
01:01:21,973 --> 01:01:24,498
I cannot understand it.

721
01:01:24,576 --> 01:01:28,569
L- I did not think
my ears were bad too.

722
01:01:28,647 --> 01:01:32,549
Well, as I was saying, Baron,
I am thoroughly familiar...

723
01:01:32,617 --> 01:01:35,108
with every detail of your investment
in your airline.

724
01:01:35,186 --> 01:01:37,882
You can be sure I did not acquaint
myself with these facts...

725
01:01:37,956 --> 01:01:41,585
- simply to- to pass away the time.
- Of course. Of course.

726
01:01:41,660 --> 01:01:44,788
Now, although your
considerable expenditures...

727
01:01:44,863 --> 01:01:47,195
will undoubtedly improve
the air transportation...

728
01:01:47,265 --> 01:01:49,756
- I nevertheless feel that...

729
01:01:49,834 --> 01:01:52,166
There was someone listening!

730
01:01:58,009 --> 01:02:01,467
Don't worry. The baron knows
how to handle him.

731
01:02:01,546 --> 01:02:05,004
Yes. But the question is,
does Martin know how to handle him?

732
01:02:06,384 --> 01:02:08,477
Shee!

733
01:02:08,553 --> 01:02:10,612
Baron, is-is this house haunted?

734
01:02:10,689 --> 01:02:13,749
Come to think of it,
there was a story about-

735
01:02:13,825 --> 01:02:17,556
No, never mind. Please.
As a precaution against ghosts...

736
01:02:17,629 --> 01:02:20,860
I think maybe we'd better continue
this conversation in French.

737
01:02:22,067 --> 01:02:25,230
Oh. B-But my French is very bad.

738
01:02:25,303 --> 01:02:27,635
Oh, nonsense.
Your French is as good as mine.

739
01:02:35,880 --> 01:02:37,973
Oh, yeah. Yeah.

740
01:03:41,913 --> 01:03:44,814
- Good night, Baron.
- Good night, Machado.

741
01:03:48,720 --> 01:03:52,747
3:00 tomorrow, Baron.

742
01:04:00,165 --> 01:04:03,657
And then he gave her a necklace
and charged it to you.

743
01:04:03,735 --> 01:04:06,329
A very enterprising fellow.

744
01:04:06,404 --> 01:04:08,497
Pierre. You are leaving so early?

745
01:04:08,573 --> 01:04:10,666
- And why not?
- You seem to be annoyed.

746
01:04:10,742 --> 01:04:14,678
- You're a fiine one to ask.
- I?

747
01:04:14,746 --> 01:04:18,011
Precisely. For years, you and Cecilia
have scarcely looked at each other.

748
01:04:18,083 --> 01:04:21,246
But tonight, in front of my very eyes-
as if to taunt me-

749
01:04:21,319 --> 01:04:23,583
you all but fell
into each other's arms.

750
01:04:23,655 --> 01:04:25,714
Oh. Did we?

751
01:04:25,790 --> 01:04:28,088
I saw you.
I watched you every moment.

752
01:04:28,159 --> 01:04:30,354
Her voice was soft and alluring...

753
01:04:30,428 --> 01:04:33,556
her smiles enticing,
her lips inviting.

754
01:04:33,631 --> 01:04:35,690
For me?
No! For you!

755
01:04:35,767 --> 01:04:38,258
And you presume to ask me
why I am leaving.

756
01:04:38,336 --> 01:04:40,634
Good night.

757
01:04:40,705 --> 01:04:42,764
He's jealous.

758
01:04:42,841 --> 01:04:45,810
Mmm, and apparently
with good cause. Poor fellow.

759
01:04:45,877 --> 01:04:48,971
If you ask me,
he hasn't got a chance.

760
01:04:49,047 --> 01:04:51,140
Cecilia does not know
I'm back, does she?

761
01:04:51,216 --> 01:04:53,980
You are still in Buenos Aires
as far as she's concerned.

762
01:04:54,052 --> 01:04:57,419
Good. I'm still in Buenos Aires
as far as you're concerned too.

763
01:04:57,489 --> 01:05:01,289
I think I will be Senhor Martin
for just a little longer.

764
01:05:36,895 --> 01:05:39,386
- What do you mean by coming in here?
- No.

765
01:05:41,900 --> 01:05:45,165
May I remind you again
that this is our anniversary?

766
01:05:45,236 --> 01:05:49,764
The time of the most
charming memories.

767
01:05:49,841 --> 01:05:54,039
Why, a little while ago,
you were so tender, so- so gracious.

768
01:05:54,112 --> 01:05:57,309
You can stop pretending now.
Just remember one thing.

769
01:05:57,382 --> 01:06:00,943
Downstairs, you're my husband.
Upstairs, you're Senhor Martin.

770
01:06:01,019 --> 01:06:03,681
Oh, so you knew all the time, huh?

771
01:06:03,755 --> 01:06:06,656
- Why, of course.
- Since you knew who I was, then I must assume...

772
01:06:06,724 --> 01:06:09,522
those unmistakable signs of affection
you gave me downstairs...

773
01:06:09,594 --> 01:06:12,222
were for me and not your husband.

774
01:06:12,297 --> 01:06:15,789
- It was all a pretense. Good night.
- No, no. No.

775
01:06:15,867 --> 01:06:18,563
Be honest with yourself, Cecilia,
as well as with me.

776
01:06:18,636 --> 01:06:21,799
You haven't thought
of your husband once this evening.

777
01:06:21,873 --> 01:06:24,569
I felt it when I kissed you...

778
01:06:24,642 --> 01:06:27,702
and when I held you
close to me in the dance.

779
01:06:27,779 --> 01:06:30,873
The light in your eyes
was not for him, Cecilia.

780
01:06:30,949 --> 01:06:33,383
It was for me.
For me only.

781
01:06:33,451 --> 01:06:37,012
We may have started out
to deceive others...

782
01:06:37,088 --> 01:06:39,784
but let's not end by trying
to deceive ourselves, hmm?

783
01:06:42,327 --> 01:06:44,693
Why, it's amazing.

784
01:06:44,762 --> 01:06:47,356
Just then, you sounded
exactly like Manuel.

785
01:06:47,432 --> 01:06:49,559
You seem to have acquired his-

786
01:06:49,634 --> 01:06:52,159
his manner, his heart,
his mind, his-

787
01:06:52,237 --> 01:06:56,071
Well, l- I have made
a study of the baron.

788
01:06:56,140 --> 01:06:59,974
I do not believe that I could imitate
anybody else half so well.

789
01:07:12,624 --> 01:07:15,024
I love this best of all your songs.

790
01:07:18,997 --> 01:07:22,694
Please sing it for me.

791
01:07:22,767 --> 01:07:25,099
Sing?

792
01:07:25,169 --> 01:07:27,899
Mmm. ''Boa Noite. ''

793
01:07:27,972 --> 01:07:30,031
''Good Night.''

794
01:07:30,108 --> 01:07:33,441
No. No, l-
I cannot sing it. I cannot say it.

795
01:07:33,511 --> 01:07:35,604
L- I do not feel it.

796
01:07:37,048 --> 01:07:39,107
Then I'll say it for you.

797
01:07:39,183 --> 01:07:41,413
Good night.

798
01:07:41,486 --> 01:07:44,148
If you insist.

799
01:07:49,394 --> 01:07:51,487
Larry.

800
01:07:54,532 --> 01:07:56,591
You were right, my dear.

801
01:07:56,668 --> 01:07:59,728
- We shouldn't deceive ourselves.
- What?

802
01:07:59,804 --> 01:08:02,637
I can't fiight against you
any longer, Larry.

803
01:08:02,707 --> 01:08:05,335
- I'm not strong enough.
- But you must.

804
01:08:05,410 --> 01:08:07,503
Uh- I mean, uh, sure.

805
01:08:07,578 --> 01:08:11,344
You-You must be very,
very sure of yourself.

806
01:08:11,416 --> 01:08:15,910
I've never been more sure of anything
in my life than that I love you.

807
01:08:15,987 --> 01:08:18,012
Hold me tight.

808
01:08:18,089 --> 01:08:20,182
Moments like these come so seldom.

809
01:08:20,258 --> 01:08:22,351
Larry, we mustn't lose them.

810
01:08:22,427 --> 01:08:26,625
Hold me tight. Kiss me.

811
01:08:32,437 --> 01:08:35,429
Oh. Tell me that you love me.

812
01:08:35,506 --> 01:08:37,906
Tell me.

813
01:08:39,677 --> 01:08:41,702
I do.

814
01:08:41,779 --> 01:08:44,270
Say it again.

815
01:08:54,292 --> 01:08:56,385
Good night, Larry darling.

816
01:08:59,731 --> 01:09:02,723
Good night.

817
01:09:34,665 --> 01:09:39,159
# Boa noite #

818
01:09:39,237 --> 01:09:42,729
# Moonlit sky #

819
01:09:42,807 --> 01:09:45,935
##Say good night ##

820
01:09:46,010 --> 01:09:49,878
##But not good-bye ##

821
01:09:49,947 --> 01:09:52,780
# Soon every star #

822
01:09:52,850 --> 01:09:58,288
#Will be an ember #

823
01:09:58,356 --> 01:10:02,258
#And this, another kiss #

824
01:10:02,326 --> 01:10:07,195
#That we'll remember #

825
01:10:07,265 --> 01:10:11,929
## Boa noite ##

826
01:10:12,003 --> 01:10:15,200
##Night is through ##

827
01:10:15,273 --> 01:10:19,209
# Soon I'll dream #

828
01:10:19,277 --> 01:10:22,974
#And when I do #

829
01:10:23,047 --> 01:10:25,709
# I'll dream my way #

830
01:10:25,783 --> 01:10:29,651
# Into your arms again #

831
01:10:29,720 --> 01:10:34,885
# So boa noite #

832
01:10:34,959 --> 01:10:37,757
# Until #

833
01:10:37,829 --> 01:10:41,526
#Then ##

834
01:10:59,884 --> 01:11:02,751
Good morning, Man-

835
01:11:02,820 --> 01:11:05,618
Don't tell me they've refused the loan?

836
01:11:05,690 --> 01:11:07,817
Oh, I wish it were only that.

837
01:11:07,892 --> 01:11:11,191
- Something far more tragic has happened.
- Good heavens!

838
01:11:11,262 --> 01:11:14,026
My wife... has betrayed me.

839
01:11:14,098 --> 01:11:17,090
- Shee! Impossible.
- How do you know?

840
01:11:17,168 --> 01:11:21,832
Last night, my Cecilia celebrated
our anniversary with another man.

841
01:11:21,906 --> 01:11:24,033
- But who was the man?
- I was the man.

842
01:11:24,108 --> 01:11:27,202
You-You feel all right, Manuel?

843
01:11:27,278 --> 01:11:29,838
How do you expect me to feel
after a thing like that?

844
01:11:29,914 --> 01:11:31,973
I feel miserable!
Finished!

845
01:11:32,049 --> 01:11:34,381
It was like a beautiful,
horrible dream-

846
01:11:34,452 --> 01:11:37,285
at the same time delightful
and agonizing.

847
01:11:37,355 --> 01:11:39,721
I went into her room.
I took her in my arms.

848
01:11:39,790 --> 01:11:41,951
I kissed her.
She kissed me.

849
01:11:42,026 --> 01:11:44,859
I was hoping against hope.

850
01:11:44,929 --> 01:11:48,865
- I gambled, and I lost.
- But what did you lose?

851
01:11:48,933 --> 01:11:51,868
- What's wrong with a wife
kissing her own husband?
- But don't you see?

852
01:11:51,936 --> 01:11:54,632
I was posing as Martin.
She thought she was kissing him.

853
01:11:54,705 --> 01:11:56,900
Ah! But-But-
But she was kissing you.

854
01:11:56,974 --> 01:11:59,135
As I see it, it was she
who was fooled.

855
01:11:59,210 --> 01:12:01,303
I don't believe it.
She must have known.

856
01:12:01,379 --> 01:12:03,745
- She didn't.
- No.

857
01:12:03,814 --> 01:12:06,078
With him-
that is, with me-

858
01:12:06,150 --> 01:12:08,914
she was a different woman
than she ever was with me.

859
01:12:08,986 --> 01:12:13,013
What an idiot I have been.

860
01:12:13,090 --> 01:12:16,423
How wonderful she is,
now that it is too late.

861
01:12:16,494 --> 01:12:19,429
She's in love with this actor.
There is nothing I can do about it.

862
01:12:19,497 --> 01:12:22,933
I cannot ask satisfaction of him
because that actor is me.

863
01:12:23,000 --> 01:12:26,766
- That would be suicide.
- I bet she knew it was you all the time.

864
01:12:26,837 --> 01:12:28,930
I've got it.
I've got it.

865
01:12:29,006 --> 01:12:32,066
She just wanted to teach you
a lesson, and she did.

866
01:12:32,143 --> 01:12:34,668
- You think so?
- No doubt about it.

867
01:12:34,745 --> 01:12:38,943
Come to think of it,
at fiirst she was furious.

868
01:12:39,016 --> 01:12:41,246
And then, very suddenly,
she changed.

869
01:12:41,319 --> 01:12:44,550
- That was the moment she discovered it was you.
- Defiinitely.

870
01:12:44,622 --> 01:12:47,386
And right now, she's
splitting her sides over it.

871
01:12:47,458 --> 01:12:50,018
- Mm-hmm. Yeah.
- Maybe so.

872
01:12:51,629 --> 01:12:53,688
There is no reason why-

873
01:12:53,764 --> 01:12:56,392
why I should do all the worrying.

874
01:12:56,467 --> 01:13:01,200
A few gray hairs will be
very becoming to my wife.

875
01:13:01,272 --> 01:13:04,173
Get me the airport
and then the baroness.

876
01:13:11,549 --> 01:13:14,347
Come in.

877
01:13:16,287 --> 01:13:18,949
- Good morning, Baroness.
- Good morning, Pedro.

878
01:13:19,023 --> 01:13:22,584
- Lovely day, isn't it?
- Yes, Baroness.

879
01:13:22,660 --> 01:13:24,992
The baron would like
to speak with you.

880
01:13:25,062 --> 01:13:27,963
- Well, why doesn't he come in?
- He's on the telephone.

881
01:13:28,032 --> 01:13:30,523
Oh, the telephone.
Please take this, Pedro.

882
01:13:33,671 --> 01:13:36,071
Good morning, Manuel.

883
01:13:36,140 --> 01:13:39,337
Why didn't you say good-bye to me
before you left for the offiice?

884
01:13:39,410 --> 01:13:42,971
Oh, I am sorry, my dear.
I came here straight from the airport.

885
01:13:43,047 --> 01:13:46,744
You-You mean you weren't
home last night?

886
01:13:46,817 --> 01:13:49,445
I mean, you-
you just arrived?

887
01:13:49,520 --> 01:13:51,920
Oh, yes, about a half hour ago.

888
01:13:51,989 --> 01:13:55,982
What's-What's the matter, my dear?
You seem a little upset.

889
01:13:56,060 --> 01:14:00,087
Upset? No.
Why should I be upset?

890
01:14:00,164 --> 01:14:03,930
Well, you sound a bit upset.
Didn't you sleep well?

891
01:14:05,403 --> 01:14:09,134
Per-Perfectly.
Perfectly.

892
01:14:09,206 --> 01:14:11,197
Good-bye.

893
01:14:25,589 --> 01:14:29,218
Would you get me
the airport? Quickly.

894
01:14:38,636 --> 01:14:42,629
Hello. Hello, may I speak
to the manager, please?

895
01:14:44,775 --> 01:14:49,337
Hello. This is
the Baroness Duarte speaking.

896
01:14:49,413 --> 01:14:52,678
Would you please tell me what time
the baron's plane landed in Rio?

897
01:14:52,750 --> 01:14:55,378
Just a moment, please.
It's the baroness.

898
01:14:55,453 --> 01:14:58,689
She's checking up on him.

899
01:15:04,094 --> 01:15:06,654
The plane arrived
at 11:20 this morning.

900
01:15:06,730 --> 01:15:09,198
This morning? No.

901
01:15:09,266 --> 01:15:11,257
No. It must have arrived last night.

902
01:15:11,334 --> 01:15:13,495
It- It's very important.

903
01:15:13,570 --> 01:15:16,937
Bad weather forced him down
400 miles from here.

904
01:15:17,007 --> 01:15:20,272
Last night was
a very bad night, Baroness.

905
01:15:21,411 --> 01:15:23,845
Oh. Oh, yes.

906
01:15:27,284 --> 01:15:30,447
Come in.

907
01:15:30,520 --> 01:15:34,752
- Oh, Pedro, did you see the baron this morning?
- Yes, Baroness.

908
01:15:34,825 --> 01:15:39,387
Was there anything-
anything unusual about him?

909
01:15:39,463 --> 01:15:41,954
I mean, did he act as usual?

910
01:15:42,032 --> 01:15:45,399
He acted very strangely,
senhora. Very strangely.

911
01:15:45,469 --> 01:15:48,438
- How? In what way?
- In many ways.

912
01:15:48,505 --> 01:15:50,905
One: He does not take his shower.

913
01:15:50,974 --> 01:15:54,808
Two: He does not eat his breakfast.
Three: He does not shave.

914
01:15:54,878 --> 01:15:58,575
Four: He does something
he has never done before.

915
01:15:58,648 --> 01:16:01,310
He shouts at me!
He shouts at me.

916
01:16:01,384 --> 01:16:03,648
If you ask me-
and you did-

917
01:16:03,720 --> 01:16:06,211
I should say the baron
was not himself this morning.

918
01:16:06,289 --> 01:16:08,348
He- He was another man.

919
01:16:10,060 --> 01:16:13,291
- A-Another man?
- Another man.

920
01:16:13,363 --> 01:16:15,831
Call the baron's pilot
and have him come here at once.

921
01:16:15,899 --> 01:16:18,493
- He is already here, senhora.
- Here?

922
01:16:18,568 --> 01:16:20,763
Yes. He just brought
the baron's bags.

923
01:16:20,837 --> 01:16:22,930
- Show him in.
- Yes, Baroness.

924
01:16:23,006 --> 01:16:26,169
Eca.

925
01:16:26,243 --> 01:16:29,406
- Good morning, Baroness.
- Good morning, Eca.

926
01:16:29,479 --> 01:16:32,346
Eca, when did the baron
return to Rio?

927
01:16:32,415 --> 01:16:36,784
We landed at about, uh-
about 20 minutes past 11:00.

928
01:16:36,853 --> 01:16:40,516
- Last night?
- No, Baroness. This morning.

929
01:16:40,590 --> 01:16:42,649
Oh. This morning.

930
01:16:44,728 --> 01:16:49,688
Isn't it strange? I had a funny feeling
the baron returned last night.

931
01:16:49,766 --> 01:16:52,200
I suppose the wish
was father to the thought.

932
01:16:52,269 --> 01:16:54,260
Perhaps the baroness dreamed it.

933
01:16:54,337 --> 01:16:57,500
Oh, no, Eca.
No, it wasn't a dream.

934
01:16:57,574 --> 01:17:00,270
Thank you.

935
01:17:06,183 --> 01:17:08,276
Fifteen minutes since I telephoned.

936
01:17:08,351 --> 01:17:10,615
She's just had time
to interview Eca and-

937
01:17:10,687 --> 01:17:13,281
Ah! See?

938
01:17:13,356 --> 01:17:15,415
Cecilia.

939
01:17:16,593 --> 01:17:18,652
Baron Duarte speaking.

940
01:17:18,728 --> 01:17:21,595
Oh, yes.
Buenos Aires.

941
01:17:23,033 --> 01:17:25,558
Ye-Yes. Yes.

942
01:17:27,270 --> 01:17:30,797
Yes, I understand.
Thank you.

943
01:17:30,874 --> 01:17:33,900
Don't bother.
I can tell by your face.

944
01:17:33,977 --> 01:17:37,674
- Shee.
- They were very polite, but fiinal. No loan.

945
01:17:37,747 --> 01:17:41,205
I'm sorry, gentlemen.

946
01:17:41,284 --> 01:17:44,981
- Well, we're in a fiine fiix now.

947
01:17:47,824 --> 01:17:50,520
Yes?

948
01:17:50,594 --> 01:17:53,085
Senhor Machado to see Baron Duarte.

949
01:17:53,163 --> 01:17:55,222
Send him in.

950
01:17:55,298 --> 01:17:59,257
- But he wasn't supposed to come before 3:00!
- What difference does it make?

951
01:17:59,336 --> 01:18:03,170
- It gives us two hours and a half
more to raise the money!
- Where?

952
01:18:03,240 --> 01:18:05,936
Where? You-You ask-

953
01:18:06,009 --> 01:18:08,534
Don't start
with the mouth. You-

954
01:18:08,612 --> 01:18:10,910
Don't start with-
with the-

955
01:18:12,449 --> 01:18:15,418
Shee! Don't start. Please.

956
01:18:15,485 --> 01:18:18,545
Before we admit anything,
we must consult a good criminal lawyer.

957
01:18:34,204 --> 01:18:36,297
Ah! Good morning, gentlemen.

958
01:18:36,373 --> 01:18:39,433
- Lucky to fiind you all three together.

959
01:18:39,509 --> 01:18:42,774
Oh, now, that is no way to feel
on an occasion like this, is it?

960
01:18:42,846 --> 01:18:45,144
Maybe expects us to do a samba.

961
01:18:45,215 --> 01:18:48,946
- I will save you the trouble
of examining the books.
- Oh, I will pick them up later.

962
01:18:49,019 --> 01:18:51,783
- I know more about them than you think.

963
01:18:51,855 --> 01:18:55,757
I just happened to be passing. As I had
the check, I thought I would bring it up.

964
01:18:55,825 --> 01:18:57,884
- Check?
- Check?

965
01:18:57,961 --> 01:19:00,953
- Yes. Haven't you told them?
- Told them?

966
01:19:01,031 --> 01:19:03,625
Certainly- about
our conversation last night.

967
01:19:03,700 --> 01:19:07,101
Uh, no. L- l-

968
01:19:07,170 --> 01:19:09,229
I see.

969
01:19:09,306 --> 01:19:11,968
When I said it was to be
strictly confiidential...

970
01:19:12,042 --> 01:19:14,772
I meant only until
the deal was completed.

971
01:19:14,844 --> 01:19:19,338
Now everything is all right. You can
tell your business partners. Go ahead.

972
01:19:19,416 --> 01:19:22,613
- Well?
- Well, uh-

973
01:19:22,686 --> 01:19:26,247
Uh- Uh-
Oh, you see-

974
01:19:26,323 --> 01:19:30,623
Uh, last night- Uh, you-
You tell them, Machado.

975
01:19:30,694 --> 01:19:33,254
Coming from you, it will be much,
much more impressive.

976
01:19:33,330 --> 01:19:35,321
- Yes, you tell us.
- You-You tell me.

977
01:19:35,398 --> 01:19:37,525
There is really very little to tell.

978
01:19:37,600 --> 01:19:42,333
As I told the baron last night,
for a long time, I have been after his airline.

979
01:19:42,405 --> 01:19:44,532
So, in short,
I bought you out.

980
01:19:44,607 --> 01:19:47,474
Why, you seem surprised, Baron.

981
01:19:47,544 --> 01:19:50,604
Surprised?

982
01:19:50,680 --> 01:19:53,877
Yes. Yes, l- I am surprised
at-at their surprise.

983
01:19:53,950 --> 01:19:58,284
- Look. They are still surprised.

984
01:19:58,355 --> 01:20:02,724
Well, now that everything is over,
I think I might tell you something too.

985
01:20:02,792 --> 01:20:06,523
It was I who engineered
the cancellation of your contract...

986
01:20:06,596 --> 01:20:08,962
with Consolidated Airlines.

987
01:20:09,032 --> 01:20:11,227
I thought it would
push your price down...

988
01:20:11,301 --> 01:20:15,567
but I underestimated
the baron's keen business sense.

989
01:20:15,638 --> 01:20:17,731
Oh, yeah, you certainly did. Yes.

990
01:20:17,807 --> 01:20:22,744
And it was pretty nervy of you
to buy up the other 49%% yesterday.

991
01:20:22,812 --> 01:20:25,679
What made you guess that
I was after your airline, huh?

992
01:20:28,785 --> 01:20:30,878
Ah, that is your secret, huh?

993
01:20:30,954 --> 01:20:33,218
Well, l- I must be going.

994
01:20:33,289 --> 01:20:35,985
And, uh, here, uh-
Oh, yes.

995
01:20:36,059 --> 01:20:38,857
Here is your check, Baron.
And congratulations.

996
01:20:38,928 --> 01:20:42,022
Only a great business mind
could have put over a deal like this.

997
01:20:42,098 --> 01:20:44,191
Well, good day, gentlemen.

998
01:20:44,267 --> 01:20:46,565
- Good day. Good day.
- Good day.

999
01:20:53,343 --> 01:20:55,709
- Thirty-two millions.
- Shee!

1000
01:20:55,779 --> 01:20:58,339
- God bless Senhor Martin.
- Amen.

1001
01:20:58,415 --> 01:21:01,543
- What about the 49%%?
- Martin bought it.

1002
01:21:01,618 --> 01:21:03,950
He made a mistake
while our backs were turned.

1003
01:21:04,020 --> 01:21:06,420
He waved himself into it.

1004
01:21:06,489 --> 01:21:08,548
Eh, remember, gentlemen.

1005
01:21:08,625 --> 01:21:12,186
Only a great business mind
could have put over a deal like this.

1006
01:21:16,099 --> 01:21:18,693
Oh, come in.

1007
01:21:22,372 --> 01:21:24,897
The baron has just come in, senhora.

1008
01:21:24,974 --> 01:21:27,465
The baron?
Thank you, Luiza.

1009
01:21:44,994 --> 01:21:47,485
Good afternoon, Manuel.

1010
01:21:47,564 --> 01:21:51,432
- Good morning, Baroness.
- Oh. Oh, it's you.

1011
01:21:51,501 --> 01:21:53,594
Yeah. Yeah, this makeup
is my passkey.

1012
01:21:53,670 --> 01:21:56,730
I had to see ya. I was afraid Pedro
wouldn't let me in as Martin.

1013
01:21:56,806 --> 01:22:00,572
- I don't think he appreciates me.
- But the baron himself might have been here.

1014
01:22:00,643 --> 01:22:03,009
I checked on it fiirst.
He's still at the offiice.

1015
01:22:03,079 --> 01:22:05,411
Well, what do you want?

1016
01:22:05,482 --> 01:22:07,950
I want to ask you a favor, senhora.

1017
01:22:08,017 --> 01:22:12,613
But fiirst, I suppose you know now
it was me last night, not your husband.

1018
01:22:12,689 --> 01:22:14,520
Yes, but what do you want?

1019
01:22:14,591 --> 01:22:18,027
If it's not too much trouble,
I'd like a letter of recommendation.

1020
01:22:18,094 --> 01:22:20,494
Re- Recommendation?

1021
01:22:20,563 --> 01:22:23,191
After last night?

1022
01:22:23,266 --> 01:22:25,700
Well, what's the matter
with last night?

1023
01:22:25,768 --> 01:22:29,101
- Weren't you pleased with my performance?
- You're simply impossible.

1024
01:22:29,172 --> 01:22:32,005
I'd like to see you get somebody else
to do a better job.

1025
01:22:32,075 --> 01:22:34,669
- Why, you vulgar, conceited-
- Sure, I'm conceited.

1026
01:22:34,744 --> 01:22:37,872
Why shouldn't I be?
I'm the best actor in the business.

1027
01:22:37,947 --> 01:22:41,781
I don't know why you should suddenly change
your mind. You thought well of me last night.

1028
01:22:41,851 --> 01:22:43,876
I wish you'd leave.

1029
01:22:43,953 --> 01:22:46,387
If you weren't satisfiied,
why didn't you say so before?

1030
01:22:46,456 --> 01:22:49,323
Because your performance
was too good.

1031
01:22:49,392 --> 01:22:51,952
Well, I don't mind saying you gave
a darn good performance yourself.

1032
01:22:52,028 --> 01:22:54,496
Oh! Will you get out of here?

1033
01:22:54,564 --> 01:22:57,727
All right. But if the baron should happen
to be out of town again sometime...

1034
01:22:57,800 --> 01:22:59,893
I'd be glad to oblige at half the price.

1035
01:22:59,969 --> 01:23:02,164
Oh! Oh, how horrible of you!

1036
01:23:02,238 --> 01:23:05,332
You're nothing but a-
a cheap, common-

1037
01:23:05,408 --> 01:23:08,536
- Baroness, I'm a workin' man.
I gotta make a living.
- Get out!

1038
01:23:08,611 --> 01:23:13,048
All right. What about that letter?
Only take you a minute.

1039
01:23:13,116 --> 01:23:15,175
My girlfriend's kinda
burnt up about last night.

1040
01:23:15,251 --> 01:23:17,981
- I should think she would be.
- She thinks I was here all night.

1041
01:23:18,054 --> 01:23:21,023
All I want you to do is write
a little note tellin' her the truth-

1042
01:23:21,090 --> 01:23:23,149
that I left here last night
before midnight.

1043
01:23:23,226 --> 01:23:26,389
Comin' from you, why, it'd be
kind of a letter of recommendation.

1044
01:23:26,462 --> 01:23:30,262
- She'd know it was the truth.
- You mean, you left here before midnight?

1045
01:23:30,333 --> 01:23:33,700
Sure. Soon as the baron came in,
I sneaked out through the garden gate.

1046
01:23:33,770 --> 01:23:36,432
Oh, of course.

1047
01:23:36,506 --> 01:23:38,770
How stupid of me
not to have known.

1048
01:23:38,841 --> 01:23:41,901
You're really so different
from the baron when you're yourself.

1049
01:23:41,978 --> 01:23:45,744
Yeah, yeah. Yeah, it makes
my performance all the better.

1050
01:23:45,815 --> 01:23:49,581
- Now, what about that letter?
- Nothing would give me greater pleasure.

1051
01:23:49,652 --> 01:23:54,351
Oh, well, that's fiine. Just, uh,
send it over to the Samba, will you?

1052
01:23:54,424 --> 01:23:57,450
- Uh-huh.
- Well, uh, good-bye.

1053
01:23:57,527 --> 01:24:00,189
Good-bye. Oh, wait. Uh-

1054
01:24:00,263 --> 01:24:03,357
You said something about
a return engagement at half price.

1055
01:24:03,433 --> 01:24:07,733
- Yeah, that's right.
- Well, you're engaged-
right now and at full price.

1056
01:24:07,804 --> 01:24:09,863
I want to talk to you.

1057
01:24:13,509 --> 01:24:15,568
How do you know he'll come in here?

1058
01:24:15,645 --> 01:24:18,808
- He always comes in here fiirst to read his mail.
- Oh.

1059
01:24:18,881 --> 01:24:21,076
Now, look.
There's where I'll stand.

1060
01:24:21,150 --> 01:24:23,983
The moment the door opens,
you take me in your arms.

1061
01:24:24,053 --> 01:24:27,284
All right, all right. Uh, how do you think
the baron's gonna take this?

1062
01:24:27,357 --> 01:24:31,623
- Oh, he'll be furious.
- Oh. That's not so good for me.

1063
01:24:31,694 --> 01:24:34,959
Anyhow, if you love him,
what do you want to do this to him for?

1064
01:24:35,031 --> 01:24:39,297
Well, l- I want to make him jealous,
for very good reasons.

1065
01:24:39,369 --> 01:24:42,702
That's fiine. Ajealous husband
might do anything.

1066
01:24:45,875 --> 01:24:49,936
Uh, the baron is
quite a shot, isn't he?

1067
01:24:50,013 --> 01:24:52,777
- Yes.
- Yeah.

1068
01:24:52,849 --> 01:24:55,818
Mmm! I just remembered.
I left my hat and gloves out in the hall.

1069
01:24:55,885 --> 01:24:58,854
I gotta get 'em. If he sees them,
it'll tip the whole thing off.

1070
01:24:58,921 --> 01:25:01,685
Yes, but hurry, because I expect him
any minute. You'll hurry, won't you?

1071
01:25:11,868 --> 01:25:13,961
Well, Senhor Martin.

1072
01:25:14,037 --> 01:25:16,631
- This is a surprise.
- Yeah, yeah.

1073
01:25:16,706 --> 01:25:19,197
- How are you?
- Very well.

1074
01:25:19,275 --> 01:25:21,470
Now that I have the pleasure
of fiinding you here...

1075
01:25:21,544 --> 01:25:24,104
I want to thank you
for what you have done for me.

1076
01:25:24,180 --> 01:25:27,377
There is a check in the mail which will express
my gratitude much more adequately.

1077
01:25:27,450 --> 01:25:30,283
Well, thanks, Baron.
I can always use one.

1078
01:25:30,353 --> 01:25:32,378
By the way, senhor,
what are you doing here?

1079
01:25:32,455 --> 01:25:36,357
Well, uh- Um-

1080
01:25:36,426 --> 01:25:40,157
- She's crazy about you.
- Uh, who?

1081
01:25:40,229 --> 01:25:43,562
Uh, the baroness.
Your wife.

1082
01:25:43,633 --> 01:25:46,830
I'm gonna tell you the truth, Baron, not
because I wanna give the baroness away...

1083
01:25:46,903 --> 01:25:49,167
but because I'm afraid
you might muff the whole thing.

1084
01:25:49,238 --> 01:25:53,038
This has gone far enough. You were supposed
to come in and fiind me makin' love to her.

1085
01:25:53,109 --> 01:25:56,374
Oh, really?

1086
01:25:56,446 --> 01:26:00,041
Yeah. She found out about your
little gag and wants to get even.

1087
01:26:00,116 --> 01:26:03,176
Oh. Very interesting.

1088
01:26:03,252 --> 01:26:07,746
She wants to start all over and live
happily ever after like they do in the movies.

1089
01:26:07,824 --> 01:26:10,486
- So do I.
- On the level?

1090
01:26:10,560 --> 01:26:12,653
Yes, on the level.

1091
01:26:13,963 --> 01:26:17,228
You, uh-You know what this is?

1092
01:26:17,300 --> 01:26:20,201
Yeah. I used to have one, too,
till I met Carmen.

1093
01:26:20,269 --> 01:26:22,430
It's funny how a man becomes
a walkin' telephone directory...

1094
01:26:22,505 --> 01:26:24,564
as soon as he gets out of knee pants.

1095
01:26:24,640 --> 01:26:27,507
I could auction it off at the club.

1096
01:26:27,577 --> 01:26:29,602
It would bring a fortune.

1097
01:26:29,679 --> 01:26:32,773
- But I'm going to burn it.
- Attaboy.

1098
01:26:32,849 --> 01:26:35,841
- Good-bye, senhor.
- Good-bye, Baron.

1099
01:26:35,918 --> 01:26:39,513
Uh, you won't give me away
in there, will you?

1100
01:26:39,589 --> 01:26:42,080
Oh, no, no.
I won't.

1101
01:26:54,170 --> 01:26:57,765
Oh, hurry. Hurry.
I just saw his car in the driveway.

1102
01:26:57,840 --> 01:27:00,775
Now get ready.
I expect him to come in any minute.

1103
01:27:00,843 --> 01:27:03,209
- He didn't see you, did he?
- Oh, no, no.

1104
01:27:03,279 --> 01:27:05,543
A little closer, huh?
No, no.

1105
01:27:05,615 --> 01:27:08,550
Maybe you'd better take me
in your arms. Oh, I'll show him.

1106
01:27:08,618 --> 01:27:12,452
I'll give him the most unhappy
moment of his life. I will.

1107
01:27:15,291 --> 01:27:17,623
No. Not now and not so violently.

1108
01:27:17,693 --> 01:27:20,321
Wait until he comes in the room.

1109
01:27:20,396 --> 01:27:23,422
Oh! You can't do this to me! Stop!

1110
01:27:23,499 --> 01:27:26,161
Put me down! Oh!
My husband will kill you for this.

1111
01:27:26,235 --> 01:27:28,499
Manuel! Oh! Manuel!

1112
01:27:28,571 --> 01:27:31,768
Stop! Leave me alone.
Put me down!

1113
01:27:31,841 --> 01:27:34,537
Manuel! Manuel! Oh!

1114
01:28:00,770 --> 01:28:03,102
# It don't make sense
the chica-chica-boom-chic #

1115
01:28:03,172 --> 01:28:05,299
# Chica-boom, chica, chica-boom #

1116
01:28:05,374 --> 01:28:08,537
- # But it's immense, the chica-chica-boom-chic #
- #Ah, a-chica-boom #

1117
01:28:08,611 --> 01:28:12,945
#That's all you've got to say #

1118
01:28:13,015 --> 01:28:17,315
#To chase the jinx away #

1119
01:28:17,386 --> 01:28:20,822
# Chica, chica-boom, chica, chica-boom
Chica, chica-boom, chic ##

1120
01:28:20,890 --> 01:28:24,621
# La, la, la, la #

1121
01:28:24,694 --> 01:28:30,394
- ##And so he rode away

1122
01:28:30,466 --> 01:28:35,301
# But left his heart down in Rio #

1123
01:28:35,371 --> 01:28:37,703
#All that remains of their love #

1124
01:28:37,773 --> 01:28:41,903
#Are the strains of ##

1125
01:28:41,978 --> 01:28:45,539
# I, yi, yi, yi, yi
I like you very much #

1126
01:28:45,615 --> 01:28:49,073
# I, yi, yi, yi, yi
I think you're grand #

1127
01:28:49,151 --> 01:28:52,518
#Why, why, why is it that
when I feel your touch #

1128
01:28:52,588 --> 01:28:54,852
# My heart starts to beat
to beat the band #

1129
01:28:54,924 --> 01:28:56,983
##I, yi, yi, yi, yi, yi, yi ##

1130
01:28:57,059 --> 01:29:00,392
##I, yi, yi, yi, yi

1131
01:29:00,463 --> 01:29:03,762
#You are too, too

1132
01:29:03,833 --> 01:29:05,323
Shee!

1133
01:29:05,401 --> 01:29:07,892
Chica, chica-boom, chic.

1134
01:29:07,970 --> 01:29:11,167
##Boa noite ##

# Soon every star #

1139
01:29:22,518 --> 01:29:26,921
#Will be an ember #

1140
01:29:26,989 --> 01:29:31,187
#And this, another kiss #

1141
01:29:31,260 --> 01:29:37,130

# See, see, see, see, see, see
See the moon above #

1145
01:29:49,145 --> 01:29:51,636
# Soon I'll dream #

1146
01:29:51,714 --> 01:29:53,978
#And when I do #

1147
01:29:54,050 --> 01:29:56,382
#Way, way, way
way up in the blue #

1148
01:29:56,452 --> 01:29:58,477
