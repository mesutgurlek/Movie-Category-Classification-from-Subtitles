1
00:01:31,000 --> 00:01:34,200
This could be the room
of any small boy...

2
00:01:34,200 --> 00:01:38,900
but it just happens to belong
to a boy named Christopher Robin.

3
00:01:39,000 --> 00:01:44,100
Like most small boys, Christopher Robin
has toy animals to play with.

4
00:01:44,200 --> 00:01:49,700
They all live together
in a wonderful world of make-believe.

5
00:01:49,800 --> 00:01:54,000
But his best friend is a bear
called Winnie the Pooh...

6
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:56,200
or "Pooh" for short.

7
00:01:56,300 --> 00:02:00,100
Now, Pooh had some
very unusual adventures...

8
00:02:00,100 --> 00:02:04,300
and they all happened right here
in the Hundred-Acre Wood.

9
00:02:04,300 --> 00:02:09,200
Deep in the Hundred-Acre Wood

10
00:02:09,300 --> 00:02:14,400
Where Christopher Robin plays

11
00:02:14,500 --> 00:02:20,300
You'll find
the enchanted neighborhood

12
00:02:20,400 --> 00:02:26,400
Of Christopher's
childhood days

13
00:02:26,400 --> 00:02:31,300
A donkey named Eeyore
is his friend

14
00:02:31,400 --> 00:02:35,800
And Kanga and little Roo

15
00:02:35,900 --> 00:02:39,000
There's Rabbit and Piglet

16
00:02:39,100 --> 00:02:41,200
And there's Owl

17
00:02:41,300 --> 00:02:45,700
But most of all
Winnie the Pooh

18
00:02:45,800 --> 00:02:49,500
Winnie the Pooh
Winnie the Pooh

19
00:02:49,700 --> 00:02:52,800
Tubby little cubby
all stuffed with fluff

20
00:02:52,900 --> 00:02:56,800
He's Winnie the Pooh
Winnie the Pooh

21
00:02:56,900 --> 00:03:00,300
Willy-nilly, silly old bear

22
00:03:00,400 --> 00:03:01,900
- Winnie the Pooh
- Pooh!

23
00:03:01,900 --> 00:03:03,100
- Winnie the Pooh
- Pooh!

24
00:03:03,300 --> 00:03:06,200
Tubby little cubby
all stuffed with fluff

25
00:03:06,300 --> 00:03:09,800
He's Winnie the Pooh
Winnie the Pooh

26
00:03:09,800 --> 00:03:14,900
Willy-nilly, silly old bear

27
00:03:15,100 --> 00:03:19,700
Winnie the Pooh lived
in this enchanted forest...

28
00:03:19,800 --> 00:03:21,600
under the name of"Sanders"...

29
00:03:21,600 --> 00:03:26,200
which means he had the name
over the door in gold letters...

30
00:03:26,300 --> 00:03:28,900
and he lived under it.

31
00:03:29,000 --> 00:03:32,100
- Now, when Pooh heard
his "pooh-coo" clock...
- Pooh-coo.

32
00:03:32,200 --> 00:03:37,200
Pooh-coo, pooh-coo, pooh-coo,
pooh-coo, pooh-coo.

33
00:03:37,300 --> 00:03:39,900
He knew it was time
for something.

34
00:03:39,900 --> 00:03:43,000
But he was a bear
of very little brain.

35
00:03:43,100 --> 00:03:48,300
So when he thought, he thought in
the most thoughtful way he could think.

36
00:03:48,400 --> 00:03:52,000
I haven't thought of anything,
have you?

37
00:03:52,000 --> 00:03:54,900
Nor neither have I.

38
00:03:55,000 --> 00:03:57,700
Think, think, think.

39
00:04:00,400 --> 00:04:04,200
Oh, yes. Time for
my stoutness exercise.

40
00:04:04,300 --> 00:04:07,000
Up, down, up.

41
00:04:07,100 --> 00:04:10,100
When I up, down
touch the ground

42
00:04:10,100 --> 00:04:13,300
It puts me in the mood

43
00:04:13,400 --> 00:04:15,600
Up, down, touch the ground

44
00:04:15,600 --> 00:04:19,400
In the mood for food

45
00:04:19,500 --> 00:04:23,400
I am stout, round
and I have found

46
00:04:23,500 --> 00:04:26,000
Speaking poundage-wise

47
00:04:26,100 --> 00:04:31,300
I improve my appetite
when I exercise

48
00:04:31,400 --> 00:04:33,600
Oh, stuff and fluff.

49
00:04:37,600 --> 00:04:40,200
That's better. Thank you.

50
00:04:40,300 --> 00:04:42,300
Now, where was I?

51
00:04:46,300 --> 00:04:51,300
Oh, yes. I'm rumbly in my tumbly.
Time for something sweet.

52
00:04:51,300 --> 00:04:55,000
I am short, fat
and proud of that

53
00:04:55,100 --> 00:04:57,400
So with all my might

54
00:04:57,500 --> 00:04:59,800
I up, down, up, down

55
00:04:59,900 --> 00:05:02,400
To my appetite's delight

56
00:05:02,500 --> 00:05:05,800
While I up, down
touch the ground

57
00:05:05,800 --> 00:05:08,400
I think of things to chew

58
00:05:08,500 --> 00:05:11,200
Like honey and milk
and chocolate.

59
00:05:11,100 --> 00:05:13,500
With a hefty, happy appetite

60
00:05:13,500 --> 00:05:15,700
I'm a hefty, happy pooh

61
00:05:15,800 --> 00:05:19,900
With a hefty, happy appetite
he's a hefty, happy pooh

62
00:05:22,500 --> 00:05:25,500
Oh, bother. Empty again.

63
00:05:25,600 --> 00:05:28,500
Only the sticky part is left.

64
00:05:35,900 --> 00:05:40,900
That buzzing noise
means something.

65
00:05:40,900 --> 00:05:45,700
And the only reason for making
a buzzing noise that I know of...

66
00:05:45,800 --> 00:05:49,500
is because you're a... a bee!

67
00:05:55,100 --> 00:05:59,600
And the only reason for being a bee
is to make honey.

68
00:06:01,600 --> 00:06:04,900
And the only reason for making honey
is so I can eat it.

69
00:06:08,300 --> 00:06:11,500
And so Winnie the Pooh
climbed the honey tree.

70
00:06:11,600 --> 00:06:14,600
He climbed and he climbed
and he climbed.

71
00:06:14,700 --> 00:06:17,900
- And as he climbed,
he hummed a little hum.
- Hum, hum

72
00:06:18,000 --> 00:06:19,000
Hum, hum

73
00:06:19,100 --> 00:06:21,500
And I call it
my "rumbly in my tumbly" song.

74
00:06:21,600 --> 00:06:24,500
Yes, and it went
something like this.

75
00:06:24,600 --> 00:06:27,700
Hum dum de dum
Hum dum de dum

76
00:06:27,800 --> 00:06:30,800
I am so rumbly
in my tumbly

77
00:06:30,900 --> 00:06:32,500
Oh!

78
00:06:32,600 --> 00:06:35,700
Time to munch
an early luncheon

79
00:06:35,800 --> 00:06:38,500
Hum de dum dum dum

80
00:06:38,600 --> 00:06:41,700
Oh, I wouldn't climb this tree

81
00:06:41,800 --> 00:06:44,400
If a pooh flew like a bee

82
00:06:44,500 --> 00:06:47,700
But I wouldn't be a bear then

83
00:06:47,800 --> 00:06:50,700
So I guess
I wouldn't care then

84
00:06:50,800 --> 00:06:54,600
Bears love honey
and I'm a Pooh bear

85
00:06:54,600 --> 00:06:57,500
So I do care
So I climb there

86
00:06:57,600 --> 00:07:00,700
I'm so rumbly in my tumbly

87
00:07:00,700 --> 00:07:02,600
Time for something

88
00:07:02,600 --> 00:07:07,800
For something sweet to eat!

89
00:07:07,900 --> 00:07:12,800
If only I hadn't...
You see, what I meant to do...

90
00:07:12,900 --> 00:07:16,800
And it all comes, I suppose,
from liking honey so much.

91
00:07:19,800 --> 00:07:22,300
Oh, bother.

92
00:07:22,400 --> 00:07:26,200
Winnie the Pooh
crawled out of the gorse bush...

93
00:07:26,200 --> 00:07:30,200
brushed the prickles from his nose
and began to think again.

94
00:07:30,300 --> 00:07:33,300
- Think, think, think.
- And the first person
he thought of was...

95
00:07:33,400 --> 00:07:36,500
- Winnie the Pooh?
- No. Christopher Robin.

96
00:07:36,600 --> 00:07:38,600
Oh.

97
00:07:38,700 --> 00:07:42,300
Christopher Robin lived
in another part of the forest...

98
00:07:42,400 --> 00:07:46,800
where he could be near his friends
and help them with their problems.

99
00:07:46,800 --> 00:07:50,400
On this summer day,
gloomy old Eeyore...

100
00:07:50,500 --> 00:07:54,900
being stuffed with sawdust,
had lost his tail again.

101
00:07:55,000 --> 00:07:58,800
- Eeyore, this won't hurt.
- Never does.

102
00:08:02,800 --> 00:08:06,100
There now. Did I get your tail
back on properly, Eeyore?

103
00:08:06,200 --> 00:08:10,400
No matter. Most likely
lose it again anyway.

104
00:08:12,400 --> 00:08:14,200
It is my considered opinion...

105
00:08:14,200 --> 00:08:18,600
that Eeyore's tail should be
placed a trifle to the, uh, right.

106
00:08:18,700 --> 00:08:23,400
And now, if you were to ask me,
I think it's just a wee bit...

107
00:08:23,500 --> 00:08:25,100
South.

108
00:08:25,200 --> 00:08:28,600
No, no. North, dear.

109
00:08:28,700 --> 00:08:33,700
Cheer up, Eeyore. Don't be so gloomy.
Try swishing it.

110
00:08:39,400 --> 00:08:42,500
- It worked. It worked.
- Oh, goody! Hooray!

111
00:08:42,500 --> 00:08:48,800
Thanks. It's not much of a tail,
but I'm sort of attached to it.

112
00:08:48,900 --> 00:08:53,800
- Good morning, Christopher Robin.
- Oh, good morning, Winnie the Pooh.

113
00:08:53,700 --> 00:08:56,200
- Good morning, Pooh bear.
- Good morning, Pooh bear.

114
00:08:56,300 --> 00:08:58,800
If it is a good morning,
which I doubt.

115
00:09:02,300 --> 00:09:08,000
- What are you looking for, Pooh bear?
- I just said to myself, coming along
thinking and wondering...

116
00:09:08,100 --> 00:09:10,700
if you had such a thing as, uh...

117
00:09:10,800 --> 00:09:15,100
such a thing, Christopher,
uh, as a balloon, about you.

118
00:09:17,500 --> 00:09:19,700
What do you want a balloon for?

119
00:09:23,200 --> 00:09:26,700
- Honey.
- But you don't get honey
with a balloon.

120
00:09:26,800 --> 00:09:29,800
- I do.
- How?

121
00:09:29,900 --> 00:09:34,300
I shall fly like a bee,
up to the honey tree. See?

122
00:09:34,400 --> 00:09:38,600
But just a minute.
You can't fool the bees that way.

123
00:09:38,600 --> 00:09:40,700
You'll see.

124
00:09:40,800 --> 00:09:46,400
Now, would you be so kind as to tow me
to a muddy place of which I know of.

125
00:09:46,400 --> 00:09:51,300
So Christopher Robin towed Winnie
the Pooh to the very muddy place.

126
00:09:53,700 --> 00:09:58,600
And Pooh rolled and rolled
until he was black all over.

127
00:10:02,400 --> 00:10:05,600
There, now.

128
00:10:05,700 --> 00:10:10,600
- Isn't this a clever disguise?
- What are you supposed to be?

129
00:10:12,800 --> 00:10:15,700
I'm a little, black
rain cloud, of course.

130
00:10:16,700 --> 00:10:18,600
Silly old bear.

131
00:10:18,700 --> 00:10:22,300
Now, would you aim me
at the bees, please?

132
00:10:24,300 --> 00:10:28,300
- Careful, Pooh. Hold on tight.
- Yes.

133
00:10:28,500 --> 00:10:30,900
- Four...
- Yes.
- Three...
- Yes.

134
00:10:30,900 --> 00:10:33,600
- Two...
- Yes.
- One!

135
00:10:33,700 --> 00:10:38,300
I'm just a little, black rain cloud

136
00:10:38,400 --> 00:10:42,100
Hovering under the honey tree

137
00:10:42,000 --> 00:10:46,300
I'm only a little, black rain cloud

138
00:10:46,500 --> 00:10:49,700
Pay no attention to little me

139
00:10:49,700 --> 00:10:54,400
Oh, everyone knows
that a rain cloud

140
00:10:54,500 --> 00:10:57,300
Never eats honey
no, not a nip

141
00:10:57,400 --> 00:11:02,600
I'm just floating around
over the ground

142
00:11:02,600 --> 00:11:05,600
Wondering where I will drip

143
00:11:09,400 --> 00:11:13,600
Christopher Robin,
I think the bees...

144
00:11:13,700 --> 00:11:17,400
S-U-S-P-E-C-T something.

145
00:11:17,400 --> 00:11:19,900
Perhaps they think
you're after their honey.

146
00:11:20,000 --> 00:11:23,700
Well, it may be that.
You never can tell with bees.

147
00:11:23,800 --> 00:11:28,700
Oh, I'm just
a little, black rain cloud

148
00:11:28,700 --> 00:11:33,700
Hovering under the honey tree

149
00:12:06,600 --> 00:12:10,500
Christopher Robin!

150
00:12:10,500 --> 00:12:13,600
I think it would help
with this deception...

151
00:12:13,700 --> 00:12:17,200
if you would just kind of open
your umbrella and say...

152
00:12:17,400 --> 00:12:21,800
- "Tut, tut, it looks like rain."
- Tut, tut, it looks like rain.

153
00:12:21,900 --> 00:12:25,100
Tut, tut, it looks like rain.

154
00:12:37,200 --> 00:12:40,900
Christopher Robin, I have come
to a very important decision.

155
00:12:41,000 --> 00:12:45,000
These are the wrong sorts of bees.

156
00:13:01,500 --> 00:13:04,700
Excuse me, please, bees.

157
00:13:09,500 --> 00:13:12,100
Christopher Robin!

158
00:13:13,500 --> 00:13:16,200
Oh, bother!

159
00:13:16,300 --> 00:13:18,400
I think I shall come down.

160
00:13:19,500 --> 00:13:21,500
I'll catch you, Pooh.

161
00:13:26,600 --> 00:13:29,000
Hurry, come on. The bees!

162
00:13:30,900 --> 00:13:33,200
Help, Christopher!

163
00:13:39,800 --> 00:13:43,900
Christopher Robin,
you never can tell with bees.

164
00:13:48,400 --> 00:13:51,200
Now, Pooh was not the sort
to give up easily.

165
00:13:51,200 --> 00:13:55,300
When he put his mind to honey,
he stuck to it.

166
00:13:55,400 --> 00:13:58,300
Now, honey rhymes with bunny...

167
00:13:58,400 --> 00:14:00,500
and bunny rhymes with, uh...

168
00:14:00,600 --> 00:14:03,100
Rabbit?

169
00:14:03,200 --> 00:14:07,300
Yeah, I like Rabbit
because he uses short, easy words...

170
00:14:07,300 --> 00:14:11,900
like, "How about lunch"
and "Help yourself, Pooh."

171
00:14:12,000 --> 00:14:14,900
Pooh? Lunch?
Oh, no. Not again.

172
00:14:15,000 --> 00:14:17,700
Oh, my. Oh, my.
Oh, my goodness gracious!

173
00:14:17,800 --> 00:14:20,900
Is anybody at home?

174
00:14:20,900 --> 00:14:24,900
What I said was,
"Is anybody at home?"

175
00:14:24,900 --> 00:14:27,700
- No.
- Bother.

176
00:14:27,800 --> 00:14:31,600
- Isn't there anybody here at all?
- Nobody.

177
00:14:31,700 --> 00:14:37,400
Must be somebody there because
somebody must have said, "Nobody."

178
00:14:37,500 --> 00:14:39,800
- Rabbit, isn't that you?
- No!

179
00:14:39,900 --> 00:14:41,900
Well, isn't that the Rabbit's voice?

180
00:14:42,000 --> 00:14:46,100
I don't think so.
It isn't meant to be.

181
00:14:46,200 --> 00:14:48,200
- Hello, Rabbit.
- Oh.

182
00:14:48,300 --> 00:14:51,500
Oh, hello, Pooh bear.
Pooh bear!

183
00:14:51,500 --> 00:14:56,400
Uh, uh...
What a pleasant surprise.

184
00:14:56,400 --> 00:14:58,600
Uh, how about lunch?

185
00:14:58,700 --> 00:15:00,900
Oh, thank you, Rabbit.

186
00:15:01,000 --> 00:15:03,100
And help yourself, Pooh.

187
00:15:06,700 --> 00:15:11,600
Uh, would you like condensed milk
or honey on your bread?

188
00:15:11,700 --> 00:15:17,000
Both. But never mind the bread, please.
Just a small helping, if you please.

189
00:15:17,000 --> 00:15:19,700
Huh, there you are.

190
00:15:24,000 --> 00:15:26,100
Is, uh, something wrong?

191
00:15:26,200 --> 00:15:29,600
Well, I did mean
a little larger "small helping."

192
00:15:29,700 --> 00:15:32,800
Perhaps it would save time
if you took the whole jar.

193
00:15:32,900 --> 00:15:34,900
Thank you, Rabbit.

194
00:15:36,800 --> 00:15:41,100
So Pooh ate and ate
and ate and ate...

195
00:15:41,100 --> 00:15:43,900
and ate and ate
and ate and ate...

196
00:15:44,000 --> 00:15:46,000
and ate.

197
00:15:46,000 --> 00:15:48,300
Until at last he said to Rabbit...

198
00:15:48,300 --> 00:15:50,900
in a rather sticky voice:

199
00:15:51,000 --> 00:15:53,100
I must be going now.

200
00:15:53,100 --> 00:15:55,400
Good-bye, Rabbit.

201
00:15:55,500 --> 00:15:59,300
Well, good-bye, if you're sure
you won't have any more.

202
00:15:59,300 --> 00:16:03,400
- Is there any more?
- No, there isn't.

203
00:16:03,500 --> 00:16:05,500
I thought not.

204
00:16:10,400 --> 00:16:14,500
Oh, oh, help and bother!
I'm stuck.

205
00:16:14,600 --> 00:16:18,100
Oh, dear. Oh, gracious. Oh.

206
00:16:18,200 --> 00:16:20,700
Well, it all comes
from eating too much.

207
00:16:22,600 --> 00:16:26,500
It all comes from not having
front doors big enough!

208
00:16:28,700 --> 00:16:30,700
Oh, dear, it's no use.

209
00:16:30,800 --> 00:16:34,200
There's only one thing to do.
I'll get Christopher Robin.

210
00:16:34,300 --> 00:16:38,500
Oh, dear. Oh, dear. Oh, dear.
Oh, my. Heavens to Betsy.

211
00:16:48,300 --> 00:16:52,400
- Well, if it isn't Pooh bear.
- Oh, hello, Owl.

212
00:16:52,500 --> 00:16:56,200
Splendid day to be up and about
one's business, quite, eh?

213
00:16:58,200 --> 00:17:00,200
Oh.

214
00:17:01,700 --> 00:17:04,700
I say, are you stuck?

215
00:17:04,700 --> 00:17:07,800
No, no, just resting...

216
00:17:07,800 --> 00:17:11,900
and thinking
and humming to myself.

217
00:17:13,000 --> 00:17:15,500
You, sir, are stuck...

218
00:17:15,600 --> 00:17:17,800
a wedged bear,
in a great tightness.

219
00:17:17,900 --> 00:17:20,400
In a word, irremovable.

220
00:17:20,500 --> 00:17:24,500
Now obviously, this situation
calls for an expert.

221
00:17:26,300 --> 00:17:29,800
Somebody call
for an excavation expert?

222
00:17:29,800 --> 00:17:32,400
I'm not in the book,
but I'm at your service.

223
00:17:32,500 --> 00:17:34,600
Gopher's the name.
Here's my card.

224
00:17:34,700 --> 00:17:38,300
- What's your problem?
- Yes, yes, yes, yes.

225
00:17:38,300 --> 00:17:42,300
It seems the entrance
to Rabbit's domicile is impassable.

226
00:17:42,400 --> 00:17:44,900
Uh, to be exact, plugged.

227
00:17:45,000 --> 00:17:47,100
And you want me to dig it out?

228
00:17:47,100 --> 00:17:49,400
Precisely.

229
00:17:49,500 --> 00:17:53,300
Uh, I say, it's over here,
my good fellow.

230
00:17:56,400 --> 00:17:59,900
Oh, the first thing to be done
is get rid of that bear.

231
00:17:59,900 --> 00:18:02,200
He's gummin' up the whole project.

232
00:18:02,400 --> 00:18:05,000
Dash it all, he is the project!

233
00:18:05,000 --> 00:18:07,900
Um, hard digging.
Might hit bedrock.

234
00:18:08,000 --> 00:18:11,500
Danger of cave-in. Risky.

235
00:18:11,600 --> 00:18:16,300
Need planks for bracing.
Big job. Take two, three days.

236
00:18:16,400 --> 00:18:19,400
Three days?
What about lunches?

237
00:18:19,500 --> 00:18:23,300
No problem, I always go home for lunch.
Oh, oh! This will run into money.

238
00:18:23,400 --> 00:18:26,500
I, uh... I say, how much?

239
00:18:26,700 --> 00:18:31,100
Do the job for hourly rate
plus cover materials, plus overtime...

240
00:18:31,200 --> 00:18:33,400
plus ten percent.

241
00:18:33,500 --> 00:18:36,900
- And your estimate?
- Nope, can't give an estimate.

242
00:18:37,000 --> 00:18:40,100
- Too risky.
- Blast it all.

243
00:18:40,200 --> 00:18:44,500
- Good idea! We'll dynamite. Save time.
- Eh, what's the charge?

244
00:18:44,500 --> 00:18:47,300
The charge? Oh, about
seven sticks of dynamite.

245
00:18:47,400 --> 00:18:50,100
Oh, no, no, no, the cost!
The charge in money?

246
00:18:50,200 --> 00:18:53,200
Nope, no charge account.
I work strictly cash.

247
00:18:53,200 --> 00:18:55,500
Obviously, but, I should think...

248
00:18:55,600 --> 00:19:01,000
Well, I can't stand around lollygagging
all day. I got a tight schedule.

249
00:19:01,100 --> 00:19:05,000
If you think it over,
let me know. You got my card.
I'm not in the book, you know.

250
00:19:05,100 --> 00:19:08,700
Oh. Dash it all, he's gone.

251
00:19:08,700 --> 00:19:12,100
After all,
he's not in the book, you know.

252
00:19:12,100 --> 00:19:14,200
- Oh.
- Here we come. Don't worry.

253
00:19:14,900 --> 00:19:18,700
Cheer up, Pooh bear.
We're coming.

254
00:19:18,700 --> 00:19:22,100
- We'll get you out.
- Well, maybe.

255
00:19:22,100 --> 00:19:26,100
Silly old bear.
Here, give me your paw.

256
00:19:29,800 --> 00:19:33,200
Ow. It's no use. I'm stuck.

257
00:19:33,300 --> 00:19:37,400
Well, if we can't pull you out, Pooh,
perhaps we can push you back.

258
00:19:37,500 --> 00:19:40,300
Oh, no! Not that!
Oh, my gracious!

259
00:19:40,300 --> 00:19:42,900
Oh, dear!

260
00:19:42,900 --> 00:19:48,000
Having got this far,
it seems a pity to waste it.

261
00:19:48,000 --> 00:19:51,200
Pooh bear, there's only
one thing we can do:

262
00:19:51,200 --> 00:19:56,300
- Wait for you to get thin again.
- Oh, bother. How long will that take?

263
00:19:56,400 --> 00:20:00,600
Days. Weeks. Months.
Who knows?

264
00:20:00,700 --> 00:20:03,200
Oh, dear.

265
00:20:03,300 --> 00:20:06,200
If I have to face that...

266
00:20:06,300 --> 00:20:08,400
that thing for months...

267
00:20:08,500 --> 00:20:11,600
well, I might as well
make the best of it.

268
00:20:12,800 --> 00:20:15,800
Oh, no!
There it is again!

269
00:20:15,800 --> 00:20:19,500
Well, I'll just turn it to the wall.

270
00:20:19,600 --> 00:20:21,600
Oh, dear!

271
00:20:22,800 --> 00:20:25,500
Yes, a frame. Uh-huh.

272
00:20:28,700 --> 00:20:32,100
Oh. No, no, no. No.

273
00:20:34,000 --> 00:20:36,000
Very nice.

274
00:20:38,300 --> 00:20:41,100
And a splash of color.

275
00:20:41,200 --> 00:20:45,400
Oh, it just doesn't have
that rustic, informal look.

276
00:20:47,700 --> 00:20:50,700
There, a hunting trophy.

277
00:20:50,800 --> 00:20:53,800
Aha! I know just the thing.

278
00:20:54,900 --> 00:20:57,000
Something tickles.

279
00:20:59,300 --> 00:21:03,000
Oh, Pooh!
You messed up my moose!

280
00:21:04,400 --> 00:21:08,100
Pooh, Roo has a little surprise for you.

281
00:21:08,200 --> 00:21:12,300
- Flowers.
- Honeysuckle.

282
00:21:12,400 --> 00:21:17,300
No, Pooh, you don't eat them.
You smell them.

283
00:21:17,400 --> 00:21:19,800
Oh.

284
00:21:19,900 --> 00:21:24,300
That's not bad. Not bad at all.
It's rather good, I think.

285
00:21:24,400 --> 00:21:27,400
- Ah...
- Oh, no! Hold it!

286
00:21:28,900 --> 00:21:31,600
Oh, no! No, help!

287
00:21:33,400 --> 00:21:37,000
Why did I ever invite
that bear to lunch?

288
00:21:36,900 --> 00:21:40,000
Why, oh, why, oh, why?

289
00:21:40,100 --> 00:21:44,300
While Pooh's bottom was stuck
at the top of page 28...

290
00:21:44,400 --> 00:21:47,900
his top was stuck
at the bottom of page 30.

291
00:21:48,000 --> 00:21:51,100
So both ends waited
to get thin again...

292
00:21:51,200 --> 00:21:53,200
day after day...

293
00:21:53,300 --> 00:21:56,800
night after lonely night.

294
00:21:59,000 --> 00:22:02,800
I wonder what's for breakfast.

295
00:22:05,400 --> 00:22:07,600
Breakfast.

296
00:22:11,800 --> 00:22:13,800
Lunch.

297
00:22:13,900 --> 00:22:16,700
Huh? A lunch box!

298
00:22:16,800 --> 00:22:19,300
It certainly is!

299
00:22:19,400 --> 00:22:24,200
I'm working the swing shift, you know.
Time for my midnight snack.

300
00:22:24,300 --> 00:22:27,400
Say, ain't you that stuck-up bear?

301
00:22:27,500 --> 00:22:31,100
Hmm. I still think I could
blast you out of there.

302
00:22:31,200 --> 00:22:36,800
Uh, what sort of lunch
is in that lunch box?

303
00:22:36,700 --> 00:22:40,800
Well, let's see here.
Ah, um, oh!

304
00:22:40,900 --> 00:22:43,100
Summer squash...

305
00:22:45,100 --> 00:22:50,000
salmon salad, succotash,
spiced custard...

306
00:22:50,100 --> 00:22:52,100
and honey.

307
00:22:52,200 --> 00:22:56,000
- Honey?
- Honey? Oh, no!

308
00:22:57,400 --> 00:23:01,500
Could you spare
a small smackerel?

309
00:23:01,700 --> 00:23:05,900
Say, you ought to do something
about that speech impediment, sonny.

310
00:23:06,100 --> 00:23:08,700
- Oh, thank you, Gopher.
- Oh, no! Not that!

311
00:23:08,800 --> 00:23:12,000
No, no, no, no, no!
Not one drop!

312
00:23:12,100 --> 00:23:15,200
But, Rabbit,
I wasn't going to eat it.

313
00:23:15,200 --> 00:23:17,700
I was just going to taste it.

314
00:23:17,700 --> 00:23:20,000
I'll taste it for you.

315
00:23:20,100 --> 00:23:25,400
That supercilious scoundrel
confiscated my honey.

316
00:23:25,500 --> 00:23:28,500
Don't feed the bear.

317
00:23:30,200 --> 00:23:32,300
I'm going to skedaddle.

318
00:23:32,300 --> 00:23:35,100
I'm not in the book.

319
00:23:35,100 --> 00:23:37,200
And I'm "ding danged" glad of it!

320
00:23:38,000 --> 00:23:42,800
And then one morning
when Rabbit was beginning to think...

321
00:23:42,800 --> 00:23:46,800
that he might never be able to use
his front door again, it happened.

322
00:23:46,900 --> 00:23:49,600
He budged. Hooray!
"Christopher Crobbin."

323
00:23:49,600 --> 00:23:53,900
No, "Chrostofer Rubin."
He "bidged!" He "badged!" He "booged!"

324
00:23:54,000 --> 00:23:57,800
- Today is the day!
- Hooray for you

325
00:23:57,900 --> 00:24:00,100
Hooray for me

326
00:24:00,200 --> 00:24:04,800
Hooray, hooray
The pooh will soon be free

327
00:24:04,900 --> 00:24:08,500
Dum ba dum
ba dum ba dum ba dum

328
00:24:08,600 --> 00:24:10,900
Now the time has
come for proving

329
00:24:11,000 --> 00:24:13,100
What the diet did for Pooh

330
00:24:13,200 --> 00:24:15,300
And since we pledged
he'd be unwedged

331
00:24:15,400 --> 00:24:17,400
That's what we're going to do

332
00:24:17,400 --> 00:24:19,700
He'll be pulled
and he'll be tugged

333
00:24:19,800 --> 00:24:21,800
And eventually unplugged

334
00:24:21,800 --> 00:24:24,000
We'll have a tug-of-war

335
00:24:24,100 --> 00:24:27,000
To open Rabbit's door

336
00:24:27,100 --> 00:24:31,900
Think "heave-age,"think "ho-age"

337
00:24:32,000 --> 00:24:36,600
And out the pooh will "go-age"

338
00:24:36,800 --> 00:24:41,300
For mind over matter

339
00:24:41,400 --> 00:24:45,700
Has made the pooh "un-fatter"

340
00:24:48,700 --> 00:24:51,100
Heave-ho

341
00:24:51,100 --> 00:24:53,100
Heave-ho

342
00:24:53,100 --> 00:24:58,500
Heave, heave, heave, heave, heave

343
00:24:59,900 --> 00:25:02,700
- There he goes!
- Suffering sassafras.

344
00:25:02,800 --> 00:25:08,000
He's sailing clean out of the book!
Quick! Turn the page!

345
00:25:14,200 --> 00:25:16,200
Stuck again.

346
00:25:16,200 --> 00:25:18,700
Don't worry, Pooh.
We'll get you out.

347
00:25:18,800 --> 00:25:22,100
No hurry. Take your time.

348
00:25:22,200 --> 00:25:24,300
Yum-yum.

349
00:25:25,600 --> 00:25:28,200
Bears love honey
and I'm a pooh bear

350
00:25:28,200 --> 00:25:32,200
Yum, yum, yum, yum
Slurp, slurp, slurp, slurp

351
00:25:32,200 --> 00:25:36,400
Yum, yum, yum, yum
Time for something sweet

352
00:25:36,600 --> 00:25:39,200
And so we come
to the next chapter in which...

353
00:25:39,300 --> 00:25:41,700
But I haven't finished yet.

354
00:25:41,800 --> 00:25:44,100
But, Pooh, you're in the next chapter.

355
00:25:44,100 --> 00:25:47,000
Oh. What happens to me?

356
00:25:47,100 --> 00:25:50,500
Well, let's turn the page
and find out.

357
00:25:50,600 --> 00:25:53,800
Now, one fine day, the east wind...

358
00:25:53,900 --> 00:25:56,300
traded places with the west wind.

359
00:25:56,400 --> 00:26:00,900
And that stirred things up a bit
all through the Hundred-Acre Wood.

360
00:26:05,700 --> 00:26:07,700
Now, on this blustery day...

361
00:26:07,800 --> 00:26:11,200
Pooh decided to visit
his thoughtful spot.

362
00:26:11,200 --> 00:26:14,100
Yes, and on the way
I made up a little hum.

363
00:26:14,200 --> 00:26:17,400
And it hums something like this.

364
00:26:17,500 --> 00:26:21,600
Hum dum, dum ditty dum
Hum dum, dum

365
00:26:21,600 --> 00:26:26,200
Oh, the wind is lashing lustily
and the trees are thrashing thrustily

366
00:26:26,200 --> 00:26:28,500
And the leaves are rustling gustily

367
00:26:28,600 --> 00:26:30,800
So it's rather safe to say

368
00:26:30,900 --> 00:26:34,500
That it seems that
it may turn out to be

369
00:26:36,000 --> 00:26:38,300
It feels that it will undoubtedly

370
00:26:40,400 --> 00:26:44,400
It looks like a rather
blustery day today

371
00:26:44,500 --> 00:26:47,800
It seems that
it may turn out to be

372
00:26:47,800 --> 00:26:49,800
Feels that it will undoubtedly

373
00:26:49,900 --> 00:26:54,500
Looks like a rather blustery day today

374
00:26:56,700 --> 00:27:00,700
Fortunately, Pooh's thoughtful spot
was in a sheltered place.

375
00:27:00,800 --> 00:27:04,300
Now he sat down and tried
hard to think of something.

376
00:27:04,400 --> 00:27:06,900
Think, think, think, think, think.

377
00:27:10,100 --> 00:27:12,800
Think, think, think.

378
00:27:12,800 --> 00:27:17,600
Say, what's wrong, sonny?
Got yourself a headache?

379
00:27:17,700 --> 00:27:22,400
- No, I was just thinking.
- Is that so? What about?

380
00:27:22,400 --> 00:27:26,100
L... Oh, bother.
You made me forget.

381
00:27:26,200 --> 00:27:30,200
If I was you, I'd think about
skedaddling out of here.

382
00:27:30,300 --> 00:27:33,600
- Why?
- 'Cause it's "Winds-day."

383
00:27:33,700 --> 00:27:38,300
"Winds-day"? Oh!

384
00:27:38,500 --> 00:27:41,400
Then I think I shall wish
everyone a happy "Winds-day"...

385
00:27:41,500 --> 00:27:46,600
and I shall begin with
my very dear friend, Piglet.

386
00:27:46,600 --> 00:27:51,400
Now, Piglet lived in the middle
of the forest in a very grand house...

387
00:27:51,500 --> 00:27:53,500
in the middle of a beech tree.

388
00:27:53,600 --> 00:27:56,400
And Piglet loved it very much.

389
00:27:56,500 --> 00:27:59,500
Whew, yes.

390
00:27:59,600 --> 00:28:03,800
Whoops. You see, it's been
in the family a long time.

391
00:28:03,700 --> 00:28:06,500
It belonged to my grandfather.

392
00:28:06,600 --> 00:28:11,200
Oh, that's his name up there,
"Trespassers Will."

393
00:28:11,300 --> 00:28:13,700
That's short for "Trespassers William."

394
00:28:13,800 --> 00:28:17,000
- Trespassers William?
- Yes.

395
00:28:17,100 --> 00:28:19,700
And Grandma... Oh.

396
00:28:19,700 --> 00:28:22,200
She called him T.W.

397
00:28:22,300 --> 00:28:25,000
That's even shorter.

398
00:28:25,100 --> 00:28:27,200
Yes, yes, yes.

399
00:28:27,300 --> 00:28:29,600
- And on this blustery day...
- Whoo!

400
00:28:29,600 --> 00:28:31,700
The wind was giving you
a bit of a bother.

401
00:28:31,800 --> 00:28:34,700
Now, you've been here before.

402
00:28:34,800 --> 00:28:36,800
I don't mind the leaves
that are leaving.

403
00:28:36,900 --> 00:28:40,800
It's the leaves that are coming.
Whoops!

404
00:28:40,800 --> 00:28:46,900
- Happy "Winds-day," Piglet.
- Well, it isn't very happy for me.

405
00:28:47,000 --> 00:28:51,900
- Where are you going, Piglet?
- That's what I'm asking myself, where?

406
00:28:51,900 --> 00:28:55,000
W-Whoops! P-P-Pooh!

407
00:28:55,000 --> 00:28:57,300
And what do you think
you will answer yourself?

408
00:28:57,400 --> 00:28:59,800
Oh, oh, oh! I'm unravelling.

409
00:29:03,100 --> 00:29:07,500
Whoops!
Oh, t-t-that was a c-c-close one!

410
00:29:07,600 --> 00:29:10,500
Hang on tight, Piglet.

411
00:29:10,700 --> 00:29:13,300
Oh, dear.
Oh, d-d-dear, dear!

412
00:29:17,400 --> 00:29:20,600
Look, Mama, look! A kite!

413
00:29:20,700 --> 00:29:23,400
Oh, my goodness, it's Piglet!

414
00:29:23,500 --> 00:29:27,000
Happy "Winds-day," Kanga.
Happy "Winds-day," Roo.

415
00:29:27,100 --> 00:29:29,400
Can I fly Piglet next, Pooh?

416
00:29:29,500 --> 00:29:31,800
Oh, dear.
Oh, d-d-dear, dear!

417
00:29:33,300 --> 00:29:36,100
There, that should
stand against anything.

418
00:29:36,200 --> 00:29:41,500
Oh, oh! Help, help!
Somebody, s-s-save me!

419
00:29:41,500 --> 00:29:46,600
- Happy "Winds-day," Eeyore.
- Thanks for noticing me.

420
00:29:46,700 --> 00:29:49,100
Oh, b-b-b-bother!

421
00:29:49,200 --> 00:29:54,100
Ah. Oh, what a refreshing
day for harvesting.

422
00:29:54,100 --> 00:29:59,500
- Happy Winds-day, Rabbit.
- Pooh bear, Stop! Oh, go back! Oh, no!

423
00:29:59,600 --> 00:30:02,200
Oh, no! Oh, no!

424
00:30:02,300 --> 00:30:04,300
Oh, yes!

425
00:30:04,400 --> 00:30:07,900
Well, next time, I hope he blows
right through my rutabaga patch.

426
00:30:19,300 --> 00:30:22,700
- Whoops!
- Huh? Who, who, who? Who is it?

427
00:30:22,800 --> 00:30:26,600
It's me.
P-P-Please, may I come in?

428
00:30:26,700 --> 00:30:28,900
Well, I say now.

429
00:30:29,000 --> 00:30:33,300
Someone has pasted
Piglet on my window.

430
00:30:33,300 --> 00:30:35,400
Well, well! Pooh too.

431
00:30:35,500 --> 00:30:38,800
This is a surprise.

432
00:30:38,900 --> 00:30:41,000
Do come in and make yourselves...

433
00:30:43,100 --> 00:30:47,200
- Comfortable.
- Oh!

434
00:30:47,100 --> 00:30:52,200
Am I correct in assuming it is
a rather blustery day outside?

435
00:30:52,300 --> 00:30:55,900
Yes, sir, Owl. It's a very,
very blustery day outside.

436
00:30:56,000 --> 00:30:58,600
Oh, yes. That reminds me.

437
00:30:58,700 --> 00:31:01,900
Happy "Winds-day," Owl.

438
00:31:01,900 --> 00:31:06,800
My good fellow, I wouldn't go
so far as to call it a "Winds-day"...

439
00:31:06,900 --> 00:31:08,900
just a gentle spring zephyr.

440
00:31:09,000 --> 00:31:12,200
Excuse me, Owl, but...

441
00:31:12,300 --> 00:31:14,600
is there honey in that pot?

442
00:31:14,700 --> 00:31:18,600
Oh, yes, yes, of course. Help yourself.
Now, as I was saying...

443
00:31:18,600 --> 00:31:23,000
this is just a mild spring zephyr
compared to the big wind of'67.

444
00:31:23,000 --> 00:31:26,700
Or was it, uh, '76?
Oh, well, no matter.

445
00:31:26,800 --> 00:31:31,900
- Oh, I remember the big blow well.
- I'll remember this one too.

446
00:31:31,900 --> 00:31:35,900
It was the year my Aunt Clara
went to visit her cousin.

447
00:31:36,000 --> 00:31:39,500
Now, her cousin was not only
gifted on the glockenspiel...

448
00:31:39,400 --> 00:31:44,500
but being a screech owl, also sang
soprano in the London opera.

449
00:31:47,000 --> 00:31:50,200
- Thank you, Piglet.
- You see, her constant practicing...

450
00:31:50,300 --> 00:31:55,300
so unnerved my aunt that
she laid a sea gull egg by mistake.

451
00:32:06,400 --> 00:32:08,500
Oh, dear.
Oh, d-d-dear, dear.

452
00:32:11,300 --> 00:32:16,000
Well, I say now, someone has...

453
00:32:16,200 --> 00:32:20,300
Pooh, did you do that?

454
00:32:20,400 --> 00:32:23,500
I don't think so.

455
00:32:23,600 --> 00:32:26,300
As soon as Christopher Robin
heard of the disaster...

456
00:32:26,400 --> 00:32:29,300
he hurried to the scene
of Owl's misfortune.

457
00:32:30,900 --> 00:32:32,900
What a pity.

458
00:32:33,000 --> 00:32:36,400
Owl, I don't think we will
ever be able to fix it.

459
00:32:36,400 --> 00:32:40,200
If you ask me,
when a house looks like that...

460
00:32:40,200 --> 00:32:44,200
- It's time to find another one.
- That's a very good idea, Eeyore.

461
00:32:44,300 --> 00:32:48,700
Might take a day or two,
but I'll find a new one.

462
00:32:48,800 --> 00:32:53,200
Good, that will just give me time
to tell you about my Uncle Clyde...

463
00:32:53,300 --> 00:32:55,300
a very independent barn owl.

464
00:32:55,400 --> 00:32:59,200
He didn't give a hoot for tradition.
He became enamored of a pussycat...

465
00:32:59,300 --> 00:33:02,200
and went to sea
in a beautiful pea-green boat.

466
00:33:03,400 --> 00:33:08,300
Owl talked from page 41 to page 62.

467
00:33:08,400 --> 00:33:14,600
And on page 62, the blustery day
turned into a blustery night.

468
00:33:14,700 --> 00:33:18,300
To Pooh, it was a very anxious
sort of night...

469
00:33:18,400 --> 00:33:21,900
filled with anxious sorts of noises.

470
00:33:22,000 --> 00:33:27,700
And one of the noises was a sound
that had never been heard before.

471
00:33:30,000 --> 00:33:33,600
Ah, is that you, Piglet?

472
00:33:38,000 --> 00:33:42,200
W-Well, tell me about it
tomorrow, Eeyore?

473
00:33:44,200 --> 00:33:47,200
Oh, come in,
Christopher Robin.

474
00:33:49,400 --> 00:33:53,600
Now Pooh, being a bear
of very little brain...

475
00:33:53,600 --> 00:33:57,000
decided to invite
the new sound in.

476
00:34:03,100 --> 00:34:05,800
Hello, out there.

477
00:34:05,900 --> 00:34:08,600
Oh, I hope nobody answers.

478
00:34:10,000 --> 00:34:15,600
- Hello, I'm Tigger!
- Oh. You scared me.

479
00:34:15,700 --> 00:34:19,800
Yeah, sure I did.
Everyone's scared of tiggers.

480
00:34:19,900 --> 00:34:21,900
- Uh, who are you?
- I'm Pooh.

481
00:34:22,000 --> 00:34:25,300
Oh, a pooh. Sure.

482
00:34:25,200 --> 00:34:28,100
- What's a pooh?
- You're sitting on one.

483
00:34:28,200 --> 00:34:31,300
I am? Oh, well, glad to meet ya.
Name's Tigger.

484
00:34:31,400 --> 00:34:36,000
T-I, double "guh," "err."
That spells "Tigger."

485
00:34:36,100 --> 00:34:38,100
But what is a tigger?

486
00:34:38,200 --> 00:34:42,200
Well, he asked for it!

487
00:34:42,300 --> 00:34:45,200
The wonderful thing about tiggers
is tiggers are wonderful things

488
00:34:45,200 --> 00:34:48,000
Their tops are made out of rubber
Their bottoms are made out of springs

489
00:34:48,100 --> 00:34:50,700
They're bouncy, trouncy, flouncy
pouncy fun, fun, fun, fun, fun

490
00:34:50,800 --> 00:34:53,700
But the most wonderful thing
about tiggers is I'm the only one

491
00:34:53,800 --> 00:34:57,100
I'm the only one

492
00:34:57,200 --> 00:35:01,600
- Then what's that over there?
- Huh? Oh, hey, hey. Look, look, look.

493
00:35:01,600 --> 00:35:05,700
Oh, what a strange-looking creature.

494
00:35:05,800 --> 00:35:11,100
Look at those beady little eyes,
and that "purrposturous" chin...

495
00:35:11,100 --> 00:35:15,500
and those "rickydiculus"
striped pajamas.

496
00:35:15,600 --> 00:35:21,800
- Looked like another tigger to me.
- Oh, no, it's not. I'm the only tigger.

497
00:35:21,800 --> 00:35:25,200
Watch me scare the stripes
off of this impostor.

498
00:35:30,200 --> 00:35:32,700
Is-Is-Is... Is he gone?

499
00:35:32,800 --> 00:35:36,400
All except the tail.
He's gone.

500
00:35:36,500 --> 00:35:40,100
Uh, you can come out now, Tigger.

501
00:35:40,200 --> 00:35:42,600
Tigger?

502
00:35:42,700 --> 00:35:46,400
- Hello, I'm Tigger.
- You said that.

503
00:35:46,600 --> 00:35:50,300
- Oh? Well, did I say I was hungry?
- I don't think so.

504
00:35:50,400 --> 00:35:53,400
Well, then I'll say it.
I'm hungry.

505
00:35:53,500 --> 00:35:55,500
Oh, not for honey, I hope.

506
00:35:55,600 --> 00:35:57,700
Honey! Oh, boy, honey!

507
00:35:57,700 --> 00:36:02,800
- That's what tiggers like best.
- I was afraid of that.

508
00:36:04,400 --> 00:36:06,400
Oh, say.

509
00:36:08,000 --> 00:36:12,500
Yuck! Tiggers don't like honey!

510
00:36:12,600 --> 00:36:18,400
- But you said that you liked...
- That icky, sticky stuff is only fit
for "heffalumps" and "woozles."

511
00:36:18,300 --> 00:36:20,300
You mean elephants and weasels.

512
00:36:20,400 --> 00:36:22,300
That's what I said...
"heffalumps" and "woozles."

513
00:36:22,400 --> 00:36:27,500
Well, what do heffa... lalla...
What do they do?

514
00:36:27,600 --> 00:36:31,000
- Oh, nothin' much. Just steal honey.
- Steal honey?

515
00:36:31,100 --> 00:36:36,300
Yeah, they sure do. Well, I'd better be
bouncing along now, chum. Cheerio!

516
00:36:36,400 --> 00:36:39,300
The wonderful thing about tiggers
is tiggers are wonderful things

517
00:36:39,400 --> 00:36:42,200
Their tops are made out of rubber
their bottoms are made out of springs

518
00:36:42,300 --> 00:36:45,000
They're bouncy, trouncy, flouncy
pouncy fun, fun, fun, fun, fun

519
00:36:45,100 --> 00:36:47,800
But the most wonderful thing
about tiggers is I'm the only one

520
00:36:47,900 --> 00:36:50,000
I'm the only one

521
00:36:54,500 --> 00:36:57,400
Well, if what Tigger said was true...

522
00:36:57,500 --> 00:37:01,100
and there really were
"heffalumps" and "woozles" about...

523
00:37:01,200 --> 00:37:04,100
there was only
one thing to do:

524
00:37:04,200 --> 00:37:08,100
Take drastic precautions
to protect his precious honey.

525
00:37:15,300 --> 00:37:17,800
Oh, hello.

526
00:37:17,900 --> 00:37:23,300
Am I glad to see you.
It's more friendly with two.

527
00:37:23,400 --> 00:37:26,500
Now, you go that way...

528
00:37:26,500 --> 00:37:28,600
and I'll go this way.

529
00:37:33,400 --> 00:37:36,100
You didn't see anything, did you?

530
00:37:36,100 --> 00:37:38,800
Neither did I.

531
00:37:40,300 --> 00:37:42,500
Now, the very blustery night...

532
00:37:42,500 --> 00:37:44,900
turned into a very rainy night...

533
00:37:44,900 --> 00:37:47,500
and Pooh kept his lonely vigil...

534
00:37:47,600 --> 00:37:51,800
hour after hour after hour.

535
00:37:51,900 --> 00:37:54,000
Until, at last...

536
00:37:54,100 --> 00:37:58,400
Pooh fell fast asleep
and began to dream.

537
00:38:03,000 --> 00:38:05,600
"Heffalumps" and "woozles."

538
00:38:05,600 --> 00:38:10,400
"Heffalumps" and "woozles" steal honey.

539
00:38:10,500 --> 00:38:14,200
Beware. Beware.

540
00:38:14,300 --> 00:38:16,300
They're black, they're brown
They're up, they're down

541
00:38:16,500 --> 00:38:18,500
They're in, they're out
They're all about

542
00:38:18,600 --> 00:38:20,600
They're far, they're near
They're gone, they're here

543
00:38:20,600 --> 00:38:22,700
They're quick and slick
They're insincere

544
00:38:22,900 --> 00:38:26,400
Beware, beware
be a very wary bear

545
00:38:26,500 --> 00:38:30,500
A "heffalump"or "woozle"
is very "confusle"

546
00:38:30,600 --> 00:38:34,700
A "heffalump"or "woozle's"
very sly, sly, sly, sly

547
00:38:34,800 --> 00:38:38,500
They come in ones and "twosles"
but if they so "choosles"

548
00:38:38,600 --> 00:38:42,700
Before your eyes you'll see them
multiply, ply, ply, ply

549
00:38:42,800 --> 00:38:46,600
They're extraordinary
so better be wary

550
00:38:46,700 --> 00:38:50,700
Because they come in every
shape and size, size, size, size

551
00:38:50,700 --> 00:38:54,400
If honey's what you covet
you'll find that they love it

552
00:38:54,400 --> 00:38:58,300
Because they guzzle up
the thing you prize

553
00:38:58,300 --> 00:39:00,600
They're green, they're blue
They're pink, they're white

554
00:39:00,600 --> 00:39:02,800
They're round, they're square
They're a terrible sight

555
00:39:02,900 --> 00:39:06,600
They tie themselves in horrible knots
They come in stripes or polka dots

556
00:39:06,700 --> 00:39:10,700
Beware, beware
be a very wary bear

557
00:40:47,200 --> 00:40:50,500
They're extraordinary
so better be wary

558
00:40:50,400 --> 00:40:54,700
Because they come in every
shape and size, size, size, size

559
00:40:54,800 --> 00:40:58,700
If honey's what you covet
you'll find that they love it

560
00:40:58,800 --> 00:41:03,600
Because they'll guzzle up
the things you prize

561
00:41:03,600 --> 00:41:05,800
They're black, they're brown
They're up, they're down

562
00:41:05,800 --> 00:41:07,900
They're in, they're out
They're all about

563
00:41:07,900 --> 00:41:09,900
They're far, they're near
They're gone, they're here

564
00:41:10,000 --> 00:41:12,000
They're quick and slick
They're insincere

565
00:41:12,100 --> 00:41:15,700
Beware, beware, beware, beware

566
00:41:15,800 --> 00:41:19,100
Beware

567
00:41:28,100 --> 00:41:32,600
Is it raining in there?
It's raining out here too.

568
00:41:32,700 --> 00:41:36,900
As a matter of fact, it was raining
all over the Hundred-Acre Wood.

569
00:41:36,900 --> 00:41:40,800
There was a thunder storm
on page 71.

570
00:41:40,900 --> 00:41:45,700
And on page 73,
there was a bit of a cloudburst.

571
00:41:45,700 --> 00:41:50,000
It rained and it rained
and it rained.

572
00:41:50,100 --> 00:41:52,600
The rain, rain, rain
came down, down, down

573
00:41:52,700 --> 00:41:54,700
In rushing rising rivulets

574
00:41:54,800 --> 00:41:57,000
Till the river crept out of its bed

575
00:41:57,000 --> 00:41:59,200
And crept right into Piglet's

576
00:41:59,300 --> 00:42:01,300
Poor Piglet he was frightened

577
00:42:01,400 --> 00:42:04,000
With quite a rightful fright

578
00:42:04,000 --> 00:42:09,100
And so in desperation
a message he did write

579
00:42:10,500 --> 00:42:14,100
Help! P-P-Piglet... Me!

580
00:42:14,200 --> 00:42:17,500
He placed it in a bottle

581
00:42:17,600 --> 00:42:21,500
And it floated out of sight

582
00:42:21,600 --> 00:42:24,200
And the rain, rain, rain
came down, down, down

583
00:42:24,300 --> 00:42:26,700
So Piglet started bailing

584
00:42:31,500 --> 00:42:35,900
He was unaware atop his chair
while bailing he was sailing

585
00:42:36,000 --> 00:42:38,400
And the rain, rain, rain
came down, down, down

586
00:42:38,400 --> 00:42:40,400
And the flood rose
up, up, upper

587
00:42:40,500 --> 00:42:42,800
Pooh too was caught
and so he thought

588
00:42:42,800 --> 00:42:45,100
I must rescue my supper

589
00:42:45,100 --> 00:42:49,800
Ten honey pots he rescued
enough to see him through

590
00:42:49,900 --> 00:42:52,400
But as he sopped up his supper

591
00:42:52,500 --> 00:42:56,000
The river sopped up Pooh

592
00:42:57,300 --> 00:42:59,800
And the water twirled
and tossed him

593
00:42:59,900 --> 00:43:02,500
In a honey pot canoe

594
00:43:02,600 --> 00:43:04,700
Rain, rain, rain
came down, down, down

595
00:43:04,800 --> 00:43:07,000
When the rain, rain, rain
came down, down, down

596
00:43:07,100 --> 00:43:11,500
So the Hundred-Acre Wood
got floodier and floodier.

597
00:43:11,600 --> 00:43:14,500
But the water couldn't come up
to Christopher Robin's house...

598
00:43:14,600 --> 00:43:17,200
so that's where
everyone was gathering.

599
00:43:17,300 --> 00:43:19,900
It was a time of great excitement.

600
00:43:20,000 --> 00:43:22,100
But in the midst
of all the excitement...

601
00:43:22,200 --> 00:43:26,400
Eeyore stubbornly stuck to his task
of house-hunting for Owl.

602
00:43:26,500 --> 00:43:32,000
There's one.
Cozy cottage, nice location.

603
00:43:32,000 --> 00:43:35,000
A bit damp for Owl, though.

604
00:43:35,100 --> 00:43:38,400
Meanwhile, little Roo made
an important discovery.

605
00:43:38,500 --> 00:43:43,100
Look! I've rescued a bottle.
And it's got something in it too.

606
00:43:44,500 --> 00:43:46,700
It's a message, and it says:

607
00:43:46,700 --> 00:43:50,100
"Help! P-P-Piglet... Me!"

608
00:43:50,200 --> 00:43:53,200
Owl, you fly over to Piglet's house...

609
00:43:53,300 --> 00:43:55,600
and tell him we'll make a rescue.

610
00:43:55,600 --> 00:43:58,600
A rescue? Yes, yes.
Of course, of course.

611
00:44:00,000 --> 00:44:02,400
So Owl flew out over the flood...

612
00:44:02,500 --> 00:44:05,200
and he soon spotted
two tiny objects below him.

613
00:44:05,300 --> 00:44:09,200
One was little Piglet
caught in the whirlpool...

614
00:44:09,300 --> 00:44:13,100
and the other was Pooh trying to get
the last bit of honey from the pot.

615
00:44:13,200 --> 00:44:15,200
Yum-yum.

616
00:44:15,300 --> 00:44:20,200
Oh, Owl, I don't mean to c-c-complain,
but I'm afraid I'm scared.

617
00:44:20,300 --> 00:44:23,300
Now, now, Piglet, chin up
and all that sort of thing.

618
00:44:23,400 --> 00:44:27,400
A rescue is being thought of.
Be brave, little Piglet.

619
00:44:27,400 --> 00:44:31,300
It's awfully hard to be b-b-brave
when you're such a small animal.

620
00:44:31,500 --> 00:44:35,400
Then to divert your small mind
from your unfortunate predicament...

621
00:44:35,500 --> 00:44:39,200
I shall tell you
an amusing anecdote.

622
00:44:41,000 --> 00:44:43,500
It concerns a distant cousin of mine...

623
00:44:43,500 --> 00:44:45,900
who became so frightened
during a flood that he...

624
00:44:46,000 --> 00:44:48,300
I beg your pardon, Owl,
but I th-think...

625
00:44:48,300 --> 00:44:52,200
we're coming to a "flutterfall"...
a "flatterfall"...a very big waterfall.

626
00:44:52,300 --> 00:44:54,600
Please, no interruptions.

627
00:45:13,400 --> 00:45:17,300
Ah, there you are, Pooh bear.
Now, to continue my story...

628
00:45:17,300 --> 00:45:21,000
Look, there's Pooh.
Over here, Pooh!

629
00:45:21,100 --> 00:45:23,100
Oh, hello, Christopher Robin.

630
00:45:23,100 --> 00:45:27,500
Pooh, thank goodness you're safe.
Have you seen Piglet?

631
00:45:27,600 --> 00:45:29,800
Excuse me, I have...

632
00:45:29,800 --> 00:45:33,200
What I mean is, here I am.

633
00:45:33,300 --> 00:45:37,200
- Pooh, you rescued Piglet.
- I did?

634
00:45:37,300 --> 00:45:40,300
Yes, and it was
a very brave thing to do.

635
00:45:40,400 --> 00:45:42,000
It was?

636
00:45:42,100 --> 00:45:44,700
- You are our hero.
- I am?

637
00:45:44,800 --> 00:45:49,600
And as soon as the flood is over,
I shall give you a hero party.

638
00:45:54,700 --> 00:45:56,700
Attention, everybody.

639
00:45:56,800 --> 00:46:01,800
Now, this party is a hero party
because of what someone did.

640
00:46:01,900 --> 00:46:06,900
- And that someone is...
- I found it.

641
00:46:07,000 --> 00:46:10,700
- Found what, Eeyore?
- House for Owl.

642
00:46:10,800 --> 00:46:14,400
I say, Eeyore, good show!

643
00:46:14,500 --> 00:46:17,800
Oh, isn't that wonderful.
Where is it, Eeyore?

644
00:46:17,800 --> 00:46:21,600
If you want to follow me,
I'll show it to you.

645
00:46:23,000 --> 00:46:25,000
So everyone followed Eeyore.

646
00:46:25,100 --> 00:46:29,600
Then, to the surprise of all,
Eeyore stopped right in front of...

647
00:46:29,600 --> 00:46:32,000
Piglet's house?

648
00:46:32,100 --> 00:46:34,500
Why are you
stopping here, Eeyore?

649
00:46:34,600 --> 00:46:38,000
This is it, Owl's new house.

650
00:46:38,100 --> 00:46:40,200
Oh, dear, mercy me!

651
00:46:40,300 --> 00:46:42,900
Oh, dear, mercy me too!

652
00:46:43,000 --> 00:46:45,400
Name's on it and everything.

653
00:46:45,500 --> 00:46:49,700
W-O-L, that spells Owl.

654
00:46:49,800 --> 00:46:53,100
Bless my soul, so it does.

655
00:46:53,200 --> 00:46:55,600
Well, what do you think of it?

656
00:46:55,600 --> 00:47:00,400
It is a nice house, Eeyore, but...

657
00:47:00,500 --> 00:47:04,700
It is a lovely house, Eeyore, but...

658
00:47:04,800 --> 00:47:09,700
It's... It's the best house
in the whole world.

659
00:47:09,800 --> 00:47:12,100
Tell them it's your house, Piglet.

660
00:47:12,100 --> 00:47:14,200
No, Pooh.

661
00:47:14,200 --> 00:47:19,000
This house belongs
to our very good friend...

662
00:47:19,100 --> 00:47:21,800
Owl.

663
00:47:21,900 --> 00:47:24,700
But, Piglet, where will you live?

664
00:47:24,800 --> 00:47:27,800
Well, l...
I guess I shall live...

665
00:47:28,900 --> 00:47:31,100
I suppose l-I shall live...

666
00:47:31,100 --> 00:47:35,200
With me! You shall live with me.
Won't you, Piglet?

667
00:47:35,400 --> 00:47:37,700
With you?

668
00:47:37,800 --> 00:47:42,800
Oh, thank you, Pooh bear.
Of course I will.

669
00:47:42,800 --> 00:47:46,400
Piglet, that was a very
grand thing to do.

670
00:47:46,500 --> 00:47:49,300
A heroic thing to do.

671
00:47:49,300 --> 00:47:51,600
Christopher Robin...

672
00:47:51,700 --> 00:47:57,000
can you make a one-hero party
into a two-hero party?

673
00:47:57,000 --> 00:47:59,100
Of course we can...

674
00:47:59,200 --> 00:48:01,500
silly old bear.

675
00:48:01,500 --> 00:48:04,600
And so, Pooh was a hero
for saving Piglet...

676
00:48:04,700 --> 00:48:09,000
and Piglet was a hero for giving Owl
his grand home in the beech tree.

677
00:48:08,900 --> 00:48:13,000
We never will forget
our hero of the wet

678
00:48:13,100 --> 00:48:17,000
Our quick thinking
unsinking Pooh bear

679
00:48:17,100 --> 00:48:21,200
And Piglet who indeed
helped out a friend in need

680
00:48:21,300 --> 00:48:23,700
Truly they're the heroes of the day

681
00:48:23,900 --> 00:48:29,800
So we say, Hip hip hooray
for the piglet and the pooh

682
00:48:29,900 --> 00:48:35,300
- Piglet and Pooh, we salute you
- What's all that stompin' and singin'
and silly shenanigans?

683
00:48:35,400 --> 00:48:37,200
And generosity

684
00:48:37,200 --> 00:48:41,200
Hip hip hooray
Hip hip hooray

685
00:48:41,200 --> 00:48:44,700
Hip hip hooray for Winnie the Pooh

686
00:48:46,800 --> 00:48:48,800
And Piglet too!

687
00:48:48,900 --> 00:48:53,000
I sure like bouncing.
Wasn't that fun, Piglet?

688
00:48:53,000 --> 00:48:59,000
Yes, Pooh, b-but the best part
is when it st-stops.

689
00:48:59,100 --> 00:49:03,000
Well, in the next chapter,
there's a great deal of bouncing.

690
00:49:03,000 --> 00:49:05,900
There is? Oh.

691
00:49:06,000 --> 00:49:08,100
I think that I just remembered...

692
00:49:08,200 --> 00:49:10,300
something that
I forgot to do yesterday...

693
00:49:10,400 --> 00:49:13,100
and-and shan't be able
to do tomorrow.

694
00:49:13,100 --> 00:49:17,100
So I suppose I really ought to go back
and-and do it n-now.

695
00:49:17,100 --> 00:49:20,500
- Uh, good-bye, Pooh.
- Good-bye, Piglet.

696
00:49:20,600 --> 00:49:23,600
Now, is the next chapter all about me?

697
00:49:23,700 --> 00:49:28,700
- No, no. It's mostly about Tigger.
- Oh, bother.

698
00:49:28,800 --> 00:49:31,500
- But you're in it.
- Oh, good.

699
00:49:31,600 --> 00:49:33,600
What will I be doing?

700
00:49:33,700 --> 00:49:38,000
Well, Pooh, you'll be sitting
in your thoughtful spot...

701
00:49:38,000 --> 00:49:40,400
thinking, as usual.

702
00:49:40,500 --> 00:49:43,700
Think, think. Think, think, think.
Think. Think.

703
00:49:43,700 --> 00:49:46,400
And while he was thinking,
all of a sudden...

704
00:49:46,500 --> 00:49:49,700
Hello, Pooh!
I'm Tigger!

705
00:49:49,800 --> 00:49:53,300
T-I, double "guh," "err."
That spells "Tigger."

706
00:49:53,400 --> 00:49:56,000
Yeah, I know.

707
00:49:56,000 --> 00:50:00,000
- You've bounced me before.
- I did?

708
00:50:00,000 --> 00:50:04,600
Oh, yeah! I "recoggonize" you. You're
the one that's stuffed with fluff.

709
00:50:04,700 --> 00:50:09,300
- Yeah. And you're sitting on it.
- Yeah. And it's comfy too.

710
00:50:09,400 --> 00:50:13,100
Well, I gotta go now.
I got a lot of bouncing to do.

711
00:50:13,200 --> 00:50:15,500
T-T-F-N.
Ta-ta for now.

712
00:50:16,700 --> 00:50:19,000
Well, there goes Tigger...

713
00:50:19,000 --> 00:50:22,300
always bouncing in on his friends
when they least expect him.

714
00:50:24,100 --> 00:50:26,600
Oh, hello, Piglet!
I'm Tigger.

715
00:50:26,700 --> 00:50:29,300
Oh, Tigger.
You sc-scared me.

716
00:50:29,400 --> 00:50:31,500
Oh, shucks.

717
00:50:31,500 --> 00:50:33,600
That was just
one of my little bounces.

718
00:50:33,700 --> 00:50:36,600
It was?
Oh, thank you, Tigger.

719
00:50:36,700 --> 00:50:41,500
Yeah. I'm saving my best bounce
for old long-ears!

720
00:50:42,700 --> 00:50:44,300
Ta-ta!

721
00:50:44,400 --> 00:50:46,700
Hum de dum, dum
Hum de dum, dum

722
00:50:46,700 --> 00:50:49,300
Hum de dum, dum
Dum de dum, dum

723
00:50:49,400 --> 00:50:52,100
There. There. That should do it.

724
00:50:53,500 --> 00:50:56,300
Oh, no. Stop, stop!

725
00:50:56,500 --> 00:50:58,600
Hello, Rabbit. I'm Tigger.

726
00:50:58,700 --> 00:51:02,700
- T-I, double "guh"...
- Please! Please! Don't spell it.

727
00:51:02,800 --> 00:51:07,800
Oh, dear. Oh, dear. Just...
Just look at my beautiful garden.

728
00:51:07,900 --> 00:51:10,600
Yuck! And messy, isn't it?

729
00:51:10,700 --> 00:51:14,800
Messy? Messy!
It's ruined! It's ruined, Tigger.

730
00:51:14,900 --> 00:51:18,900
Oh, why don't you ever
stop bouncing?

731
00:51:19,000 --> 00:51:22,400
Why? That's what tiggers do best.

732
00:51:22,500 --> 00:51:25,500
The wonderful thing about tiggers
is tiggers are wonderful things

733
00:51:25,600 --> 00:51:28,300
Their tops are made out of rubber
Their bottoms are made out of springs

734
00:51:28,400 --> 00:51:31,100
They're bouncy, trouncy, flouncy
pouncy, fun, fun, fun, fun, fun

735
00:51:31,200 --> 00:51:33,400
But the most wonderful thing
about tiggers is I'm the only one

736
00:51:33,400 --> 00:51:36,100
I'm the only one

737
00:51:41,700 --> 00:51:44,000
Order. Order, please.

738
00:51:44,000 --> 00:51:50,300
Now, I say Tigger's getting
so bouncy nowadays that
it's time we taught him a lesson.

739
00:51:50,300 --> 00:51:52,600
No matter
how much we like him...

740
00:51:52,600 --> 00:51:55,900
you can't deny
he just bounces too much.

741
00:51:55,900 --> 00:51:57,900
Ah, e-excuse me, Rabbit.

742
00:51:58,000 --> 00:52:02,800
But, uh, perhaps if we could think
of a way of"un-bouncing" Tigger...

743
00:52:02,800 --> 00:52:04,900
well, it would be
a very good idea, huh?

744
00:52:04,900 --> 00:52:10,000
Exactly! Just what I feel.
What do you feel, Pooh?

745
00:52:14,800 --> 00:52:17,200
- Pooh!
- Ah...

746
00:52:17,300 --> 00:52:20,500
Haven't you been listening
to what Rabbit's been saying?

747
00:52:20,600 --> 00:52:26,500
I listened, but then I had
a small piece of fluff in my ear.

748
00:52:26,600 --> 00:52:31,500
- Could you say it again, please, Rabbit?
- Well, where should I start from?

749
00:52:31,600 --> 00:52:34,600
From the moment
the fluff got in my ear.

750
00:52:34,600 --> 00:52:36,900
Well, when was that?

751
00:52:37,000 --> 00:52:40,200
I don't know.
I couldn't hear properly.

752
00:52:40,200 --> 00:52:45,800
Pooh, we were just trying to think of
a way to get the bounce out of Tigger.

753
00:52:45,900 --> 00:52:48,700
Oh, I've got a splendid idea.
Now, listen.

754
00:52:48,800 --> 00:52:52,000
We'll take Tigger
for a long explore, see?

755
00:52:52,100 --> 00:52:54,500
Someplace where he's never been...

756
00:52:54,600 --> 00:52:57,300
- And we lose him there.
- Lose him?

757
00:52:57,400 --> 00:52:59,900
Oh, we'll find him again,
next morning.

758
00:52:59,900 --> 00:53:02,400
And mark my words,
he'll be a humble tigger...

759
00:53:02,500 --> 00:53:04,500
a small-and-sad tigger...

760
00:53:04,600 --> 00:53:08,000
an "Oh, Rabbit,
am-l-glad-to-see-you" tigger.

761
00:53:08,000 --> 00:53:11,000
And it'll take the bounces
out of him, that's why.

762
00:53:11,100 --> 00:53:13,400
Now, all in favor, say, "aye."

763
00:53:13,400 --> 00:53:16,400
Aye. Pooh?

764
00:53:16,400 --> 00:53:19,400
- Pooh!
- Uh, here.

765
00:53:19,400 --> 00:53:22,900
Good. Just good.
Motion carried.

766
00:53:27,900 --> 00:53:31,100
So it was agreed that they
would start the next morning...

767
00:53:31,200 --> 00:53:35,400
which, incidentally,
turned out cold and misty.

768
00:53:40,100 --> 00:53:44,800
Pooh, as usual, had a little
something along to sustain himself.

769
00:53:48,500 --> 00:53:52,800
And now, as Tigger kept bouncing
farther and farther into the mist...

770
00:53:52,900 --> 00:53:56,300
Rabbit thought it was
a good time to lose Tigger.

771
00:53:56,400 --> 00:54:00,400
Now's our chance.
Quick! In here. Hide.

772
00:54:05,800 --> 00:54:08,200
Tigger's lost now, isn't he, Rabbit?

773
00:54:08,200 --> 00:54:11,500
Oh, he's lost, all right, Piglet.

774
00:54:11,600 --> 00:54:15,800
Oh, goody. This is lots of fun, Pooh.

775
00:54:23,600 --> 00:54:27,000
My splendid idea worked.

776
00:54:27,100 --> 00:54:29,500
Now, home we go.

777
00:54:29,500 --> 00:54:33,400
Good! Yum-yum.
It's time for lunch.

778
00:54:33,400 --> 00:54:36,900
- Halloo!
- Oh, my goodness. Hide!

779
00:54:37,000 --> 00:54:39,900
Halloo!

780
00:54:43,300 --> 00:54:46,400
That's funny.
They must be lost.

781
00:54:47,800 --> 00:54:51,300
Hello!

782
00:54:51,400 --> 00:54:56,800
- Hey, you blokes. Where are ya?
- He...

783
00:54:56,900 --> 00:54:59,900
- Shush.
- I am shushed.

784
00:55:00,000 --> 00:55:04,100
Hey, where in the heck
are you guys?

785
00:55:18,600 --> 00:55:20,800
Halloo!

786
00:55:22,100 --> 00:55:26,100
Rabbit? Piglet?
Where are you?

787
00:55:26,100 --> 00:55:28,100
Halloo!

788
00:55:30,100 --> 00:55:33,300
Hooray!
Hooray, we've done it.

789
00:55:33,300 --> 00:55:36,800
Now, come on, hurry.
Let's head for home.

790
00:55:36,900 --> 00:55:40,600
Well, Rabbit was certain that everything
was going according to plan...

791
00:55:40,700 --> 00:55:43,500
and so it seemed to be.

792
00:55:43,600 --> 00:55:45,700
But sometime later...

793
00:55:45,800 --> 00:55:49,700
on the bottom of page 123...

794
00:55:57,000 --> 00:56:01,300
It's a funny thing how everything
looks the same in the mist.

795
00:56:01,500 --> 00:56:05,200
He's right, Piglet.
It's the very same sand pit.

796
00:56:05,300 --> 00:56:07,100
I think so too, Pooh.

797
00:56:07,200 --> 00:56:10,400
Well, it's lucky I know
the forest so well, or...

798
00:56:10,400 --> 00:56:12,500
or, or we might get lost.

799
00:56:12,600 --> 00:56:15,100
Well, come on. Follow me.

800
00:56:15,200 --> 00:56:18,700
Now, Pooh was getting tired
of seeing the same sand pit...

801
00:56:18,800 --> 00:56:22,600
and he suspected it
of following them about.

802
00:56:22,500 --> 00:56:25,700
Because whichever
direction they started in...

803
00:56:25,800 --> 00:56:29,500
they always seemed
to end up at it.

804
00:56:36,100 --> 00:56:38,200
- Uh, er, Rabbit?
- Yes?

805
00:56:38,200 --> 00:56:40,200
Say, Rabbit, how would it be...

806
00:56:40,300 --> 00:56:43,900
if as soon as we're
out of sight of this old pit...

807
00:56:44,000 --> 00:56:48,100
- We just try to find it again?
- What's the good of that?

808
00:56:48,300 --> 00:56:51,200
Well, you see,
we keep looking for home...

809
00:56:51,200 --> 00:56:53,200
but we keep finding this pit.

810
00:56:53,300 --> 00:56:58,200
So I just thought that if we looked
for this pit we might find home.

811
00:56:58,300 --> 00:57:00,600
I don't see much sense in that.

812
00:57:00,700 --> 00:57:02,700
If I walked away from this pit...

813
00:57:02,800 --> 00:57:06,100
and then walked back to it,
of course I should find it.

814
00:57:06,200 --> 00:57:09,300
I'll prove it to you. Wait here.

815
00:57:12,700 --> 00:57:16,000
So Pooh and Piglet
waited in the mist for Rabbit.

816
00:57:16,000 --> 00:57:18,000
And they waited...

817
00:57:18,100 --> 00:57:21,500
and waited, and waited.

818
00:57:21,600 --> 00:57:24,800
And all the while, Pooh's
thoughts kept returning...

819
00:57:24,900 --> 00:57:26,900
to his honey pots at home.

820
00:57:32,800 --> 00:57:35,100
W-W-What was that, Pooh?

821
00:57:35,200 --> 00:57:37,700
My tummy rumbled.

822
00:57:37,800 --> 00:57:40,300
Now then, come on.
Let's go home.

823
00:57:40,300 --> 00:57:42,900
But, Pooh, do you know the way?

824
00:57:43,000 --> 00:57:47,100
No, Piglet, but there are 12 pots
of honey in my cupboard...

825
00:57:47,200 --> 00:57:49,400
and they have been
calling to my tummy.

826
00:57:49,500 --> 00:57:52,200
- They have?
- Yes, Piglet.

827
00:57:52,300 --> 00:57:56,000
I couldn't hear them before
because Rabbit would talk.

828
00:57:56,100 --> 00:57:58,200
I think I know where
they're calling from.

829
00:57:58,300 --> 00:58:01,800
So come on.
We'll just follow my tummy.

830
00:58:01,800 --> 00:58:04,300
Well, they walked off together...

831
00:58:04,400 --> 00:58:07,000
and for a long time
Piglet said nothing...

832
00:58:07,100 --> 00:58:10,800
so as not to interrupt
Pooh's honey pots.

833
00:58:10,800 --> 00:58:14,200
And sure enough,
as the mist got thinner...

834
00:58:14,200 --> 00:58:17,700
and just when Piglet
began to know where he was...

835
00:58:17,700 --> 00:58:22,200
Hey, hello there, you two blokes.
Where have you been?

836
00:58:22,300 --> 00:58:24,800
We've been trying
to find our way back home.

837
00:58:24,800 --> 00:58:29,100
Pooh, I don't think
Rabbit's splendid idea worked.

838
00:58:29,300 --> 00:58:33,100
Say, where is old long-ears, anyway?

839
00:58:33,100 --> 00:58:36,200
He must still be missing
in the mist.

840
00:58:36,300 --> 00:58:40,000
Well, leave it to me.
I'll bounce him out of there!

841
00:58:40,100 --> 00:58:42,600
T-T-F-N. Ta-ta for now.

842
00:58:46,100 --> 00:58:50,400
Meanwhile, Rabbit was still
wandering around in the mist.

843
00:58:50,500 --> 00:58:52,700
By now, he was lost and bewildered.

844
00:58:52,800 --> 00:58:55,100
And to make matters worse...

845
00:58:55,200 --> 00:58:58,700
his mind was beginning
to play tricks on him.

846
00:59:01,500 --> 00:59:04,000
What's that?

847
00:59:09,100 --> 00:59:13,300
Pooh? Piglet?

848
00:59:54,300 --> 00:59:56,300
Help!

849
00:59:56,300 --> 00:59:58,300
- Hello, Rabbit!
- Tigger!

850
00:59:58,300 --> 01:00:00,700
B-B-But you're
supposed to be lost.

851
01:00:00,700 --> 01:00:04,900
Aw, Tiggers never get lost,
bunny boy.

852
01:00:04,900 --> 01:00:07,200
Never get lost?

853
01:00:07,300 --> 01:00:09,400
- Of course not.
- Oh, no.

854
01:00:09,500 --> 01:00:14,100
Come on, Rabbit.
Let's go home. Hang on!

855
01:00:14,200 --> 01:00:20,000
So they started back. And Rabbit
was now a humiliated rabbit...

856
01:00:20,000 --> 01:00:22,400
a lost-and-found rabbit...

857
01:00:22,400 --> 01:00:26,500
an "Oh-why, oh-why-do-these-things
happen-to-me" rabbit.

858
01:00:27,900 --> 01:00:29,700
And now we come to the next chapter...

859
01:00:29,800 --> 01:00:33,600
in which the first snowfall had
covered the Hundred-Acre Wood.

860
01:00:33,600 --> 01:00:39,300
And in which Tigger learns that
even bouncing can be overdone.

861
01:00:39,400 --> 01:00:44,000
On this day, Roo was waiting
for Tigger to take him out to play.

862
01:00:44,100 --> 01:00:47,000
Mama, when is Tigger
gonna get here?

863
01:00:47,100 --> 01:00:50,600
- Be patient, dear. He'll be...
- Whee!

864
01:00:50,700 --> 01:00:54,800
Well, here I am!
Did I surprise you, Roo?

865
01:00:54,800 --> 01:00:57,600
You sure did!
I like surprises.

866
01:00:57,700 --> 01:01:01,800
- Hello, Mrs. Kanga, ma'am.
- Why, hello, Tigger, dear.

867
01:01:02,000 --> 01:01:04,500
She called me "dear."

868
01:01:04,600 --> 01:01:07,900
Roo, are you ready
for some bouncing?

869
01:01:08,000 --> 01:01:10,700
Yeah! You and me
are good bouncers.

870
01:01:10,800 --> 01:01:13,200
Just a moment, dear.

871
01:01:13,300 --> 01:01:16,900
Hold still. Goodness,
you're bouncy today.

872
01:01:17,000 --> 01:01:20,000
That's what roos do the "best-est."

873
01:01:20,100 --> 01:01:24,500
- Now keep your scarf on.
- Not so tight, Mama.

874
01:01:24,700 --> 01:01:27,700
- Is your sweater warm enough?
- Yes, Mother.

875
01:01:27,800 --> 01:01:30,900
Well, come on, Roo. Let's go!

876
01:01:30,900 --> 01:01:33,900
Tigger, have Roo home
in time for his nap.

877
01:01:33,900 --> 01:01:36,500
And be careful!

878
01:01:36,600 --> 01:01:40,400
Don't worry, Mrs. Kanga.
I'll take care of the little nipper.

879
01:01:45,900 --> 01:01:48,900
Da, da, da, da

880
01:01:48,900 --> 01:01:51,900
Da, da, da, da

881
01:01:51,900 --> 01:01:54,900
Ah! What a perfect day!

882
01:01:54,900 --> 01:01:57,200
Peace and quiet...

883
01:01:57,200 --> 01:02:00,500
and thank goodness, no Tigger.

884
01:02:00,500 --> 01:02:05,200
Say, look, look, look.
If it isn't old long-ears.

885
01:02:05,300 --> 01:02:08,800
Can tiggers ice-skate
as fancy as Mr. Rabbit?

886
01:02:08,900 --> 01:02:13,500
Can tiggers ice-skate?
Why, that's what tiggers do the best.

887
01:02:14,900 --> 01:02:16,900
Whee!

888
01:02:18,100 --> 01:02:21,100
Say, this is a cinch.

889
01:02:21,100 --> 01:02:23,600
Whee!

890
01:02:23,700 --> 01:02:27,700
- Oh, no. Not him!
- Uh-oh, look out. I can't... Watch out!

891
01:02:27,800 --> 01:02:30,000
- It can't be!
- Out of the way! Out of the way!

892
01:02:30,100 --> 01:02:33,400
Look out! I can't... Whoa!

893
01:02:40,300 --> 01:02:44,200
Oh, why does it
always have to be me?

894
01:02:44,200 --> 01:02:47,300
Why, oh, why, oh, why?

895
01:02:47,400 --> 01:02:50,000
Tigger, Tigger, are you all right?

896
01:02:52,500 --> 01:02:56,900
Yuck!
Tiggers don't like ice skating.

897
01:02:57,100 --> 01:03:01,600
So Tigger and Roo went farther
into the Hundred-Acre Wood...

898
01:03:01,700 --> 01:03:04,700
Looking for something
that tiggers do best.

899
01:03:04,800 --> 01:03:07,800
I bet you can climb trees,
huh, Tigger?

900
01:03:07,800 --> 01:03:11,400
Climb trees?
That's what tiggers do best!

901
01:03:11,400 --> 01:03:15,100
Only tiggers don't climb trees.
They bounce them!

902
01:03:15,100 --> 01:03:17,400
Come on, let's go.

903
01:03:23,900 --> 01:03:26,900
I almost bounced
clear out of the book.

904
01:03:27,000 --> 01:03:29,100
Some bouncing, huh?

905
01:03:32,700 --> 01:03:35,800
Say, how did this tree get so high?

906
01:03:38,000 --> 01:03:40,200
Hey. H-H-Hey!

907
01:03:40,300 --> 01:03:43,600
Hey, what's happening now?

908
01:03:43,600 --> 01:03:47,100
Don't swing on a string.
It's much too frail.

909
01:03:47,200 --> 01:03:51,100
The best kind of swing
is a tigger's tail. Whee!

910
01:03:51,200 --> 01:03:54,600
S-S-Stop that, kid. Please.

911
01:03:54,700 --> 01:03:59,100
S-T-O-P, stop.
You're rocking the forest.

912
01:04:01,600 --> 01:04:05,900
- What's the matter, Tigger?
- Whew! Oh, thank goodness.

913
01:04:06,000 --> 01:04:11,000
I was just getting seasick
from seeing too much.

914
01:04:11,100 --> 01:04:15,500
Well, we'll just have to leave Tigger
up in the tree top for a little while.

915
01:04:15,600 --> 01:04:19,000
Because, at the bottom
of the next page...

916
01:04:19,100 --> 01:04:21,100
Pooh is having a problem of his own.

917
01:04:21,100 --> 01:04:24,200
- What are you doing, Pooh?
- Shh!

918
01:04:24,200 --> 01:04:27,500
- Tracking something.
- Tracking what?

919
01:04:27,700 --> 01:04:31,100
Well, that's what I asked myself,
Piglet. What?

920
01:04:33,700 --> 01:04:36,300
And what do you think
you'll answer yourself?

921
01:04:36,400 --> 01:04:39,400
I shall have to wait
until I catch up with it.

922
01:04:39,500 --> 01:04:41,800
Pooh, for a bear
of very little brain...

923
01:04:41,900 --> 01:04:44,900
- You sure are a smart one!
- Thank you, Piglet.

924
01:04:45,000 --> 01:04:47,700
- Aha, ha!
- Oh!

925
01:04:47,700 --> 01:04:50,000
N-N-Now w-w-what?

926
01:04:50,100 --> 01:04:53,700
A very mysterious thing, Piglet.

927
01:04:53,700 --> 01:04:56,700
A whole new set of tracks. See?

928
01:04:56,700 --> 01:04:59,500
And so it seemed to be.

929
01:04:59,600 --> 01:05:02,400
There were the tracks
joining each other here...

930
01:05:02,400 --> 01:05:04,800
getting mixed up
with each other there.

931
01:05:04,900 --> 01:05:10,300
But to Pooh, quite plainly,
four sets of paw marks.

932
01:05:10,400 --> 01:05:14,700
Piglet, whatever it was
that made these tracks...

933
01:05:14,700 --> 01:05:17,900
has now been joined
by a "whatever-it-is."

934
01:05:18,000 --> 01:05:23,300
Y-Y-Yes. A-And all of them
are proceeding in company.

935
01:05:23,300 --> 01:05:26,500
Piglet, I wasn't exactly
expecting company.

936
01:05:26,600 --> 01:05:30,300
N-N-Neither was I, Pooh.

937
01:05:30,200 --> 01:05:33,800
So they went on,
feeling a little anxious now...

938
01:05:33,900 --> 01:05:37,500
in case the animals in front of them
were of hostile intent.

939
01:05:37,500 --> 01:05:39,600
Halloo!

940
01:05:43,900 --> 01:05:45,800
Look, look, Piglet...

941
01:05:45,900 --> 01:05:49,400
there's something
in that tree over there.

942
01:05:49,400 --> 01:05:53,000
- Is it one of the f-f-fiercer animals?
- Halloo!

943
01:05:53,100 --> 01:05:56,400
Yes. It's a "jagular."

944
01:05:56,400 --> 01:06:00,400
W-What do
jagulars d-do, Pooh?

945
01:06:00,500 --> 01:06:06,100
Well, jagulars always call,
"Halloo!"

946
01:06:06,200 --> 01:06:10,500
And when you look up,
they drop on you.

947
01:06:10,500 --> 01:06:12,600
I'm looking down, P-P-Pooh.

948
01:06:12,600 --> 01:06:15,200
Halloo!

949
01:06:15,300 --> 01:06:18,600
Hey, Tigger,
it's Pooh and Piglet.

950
01:06:18,700 --> 01:06:21,200
Pooh! Piglet!

951
01:06:21,300 --> 01:06:26,600
Why, it's only Tigger and Roo.
Come on.

952
01:06:29,200 --> 01:06:34,000
Hello, Roo. Hey, what are you
and Tigger doing up there?

953
01:06:34,100 --> 01:06:38,300
I'm all right,
but Tigger's stuck.

954
01:06:38,400 --> 01:06:41,000
Help, somebody! Please!

955
01:06:41,000 --> 01:06:43,700
Get Christopher Robin.

956
01:06:43,700 --> 01:06:49,000
Well, it wasn't too long before word
got back to Christopher Robin and
the others that Tigger was in trouble.

957
01:06:50,700 --> 01:06:54,300
Hello, Pooh.
Hello, Piglet. What's up?

958
01:06:54,400 --> 01:06:56,700
Tigger and Roo are up...

959
01:06:56,800 --> 01:07:01,000
Oh, my goodness.
Roo, how did you get way up there?

960
01:07:01,100 --> 01:07:03,800
Easy, Mama. We bounced up.

961
01:07:03,900 --> 01:07:06,500
Oh, gracious.
Do be careful, dear.

962
01:07:06,600 --> 01:07:10,300
I'm all right, Mama,
but Tigger's stuck.

963
01:07:10,400 --> 01:07:13,500
Oh, what a shame.
That's too bad.

964
01:07:13,600 --> 01:07:18,200
No, that's good. You see,
he can't bounce anybody up there.

965
01:07:18,200 --> 01:07:21,400
Oh, dear. We'll just have
to get him down somehow.

966
01:07:21,500 --> 01:07:24,300
Down? Down?
Do we have to?

967
01:07:24,400 --> 01:07:28,100
Come on, everyone.
Let's hold the corner of my coat.

968
01:07:28,200 --> 01:07:30,600
You're first, Roo. Jump!

969
01:07:30,600 --> 01:07:32,900
Try not to fall too fast, dear.

970
01:07:33,000 --> 01:07:35,700
Whee!

971
01:07:35,800 --> 01:07:40,900
- Oh, thank goodness.
- Gee, that was fun!

972
01:07:40,900 --> 01:07:44,600
Come on, Tigger.
It doesn't hurt. Jump!

973
01:07:44,700 --> 01:07:49,700
- You're next, Tigger. Jump!
- Jump?

974
01:07:49,800 --> 01:07:52,900
Tiggers don't jump.
They bounce.

975
01:07:53,000 --> 01:07:54,900
Then bounce down.

976
01:07:55,000 --> 01:07:58,600
Don't be "ridiccorous."
Tiggers only bounce up!

977
01:07:58,700 --> 01:08:00,600
You can climb down, Tigger.

978
01:08:00,700 --> 01:08:06,200
Ah, but tiggers can't climb down, uh,
because, uh, their tails get in the way.

979
01:08:06,200 --> 01:08:08,200
Hooray! That settles it.

980
01:08:08,300 --> 01:08:10,700
If he won't jump
and he can't climb down...

981
01:08:10,700 --> 01:08:13,400
then we'll just have to
leave him up there forever!

982
01:08:13,400 --> 01:08:17,100
Forever?
Oh, if I ever get out of this...

983
01:08:17,200 --> 01:08:20,500
I promise never
to bounce again, never!

984
01:08:20,500 --> 01:08:25,000
I heard that, Tigger. He promised!
Did you hear him promise?

985
01:08:25,000 --> 01:08:29,100
I heard him. I heard him!
You heard him, didn't you? Didn't you?

986
01:08:29,200 --> 01:08:33,800
Well, Tigger, your bouncing
really got you into trouble this time.

987
01:08:33,900 --> 01:08:35,900
Say, who are you?

988
01:08:36,000 --> 01:08:38,000
I'm the narrator.

989
01:08:38,200 --> 01:08:41,700
Oh, well, please, for goodness' sakes,
narrate me down from here.

990
01:08:41,800 --> 01:08:45,000
Very well. Hold on tight.

991
01:08:48,200 --> 01:08:50,400
You can let go now, Tigger.

992
01:08:50,400 --> 01:08:53,600
N-N-Never.

993
01:08:53,700 --> 01:08:58,000
But, Tigger, look for yourself.
You're perfectly safe.

994
01:09:03,900 --> 01:09:06,400
What did I tell you, Tigger?

995
01:09:06,300 --> 01:09:09,200
Come on. Back we go.

996
01:09:12,700 --> 01:09:15,800
Oh! Good old terra firma.

997
01:09:17,500 --> 01:09:20,500
Say, I'm so happy,
I feel like bouncing.

998
01:09:20,600 --> 01:09:22,900
Uh-uh-uh!
You promised. You promised.

999
01:09:23,000 --> 01:09:26,400
Oh. Oh, I did, didn't I?

1000
01:09:26,500 --> 01:09:29,900
You mean, I can't ever bounce again?

1001
01:09:30,000 --> 01:09:33,100
- Never!
- Never?

1002
01:09:38,000 --> 01:09:42,800
Not even just one
teensy, weensy bounce?

1003
01:09:42,900 --> 01:09:45,500
Not even a smidgen of a bounce.

1004
01:10:01,500 --> 01:10:06,000
Oh, the poor dear.
Oh, that's too bad.

1005
01:10:10,400 --> 01:10:15,400
Christopher Robin,
I like the old bouncy Tigger best.

1006
01:10:18,100 --> 01:10:22,700
- So do I, Roo.
- I do too.
- Me too!

1007
01:10:22,800 --> 01:10:27,300
Of course, we all do.
Don't you agree, Rabbit?

1008
01:10:29,500 --> 01:10:31,900
- L-l...
- Well, Rabbit?

1009
01:10:32,000 --> 01:10:34,500
Well, I, uh...

1010
01:10:34,500 --> 01:10:37,500
That is, uh...
Uh, what I mean...

1011
01:10:37,700 --> 01:10:42,000
- Well?
- Well, I, ah...

1012
01:10:42,000 --> 01:10:44,100
Oh, all right.

1013
01:10:44,200 --> 01:10:48,300
I guess I like
the old Tigger better too.

1014
01:10:48,400 --> 01:10:53,000
Oh, boy! You mean,
I can have my bounce back?

1015
01:10:53,100 --> 01:10:55,300
Come on, Rabbit.
Let's you and me bounce.

1016
01:10:55,400 --> 01:10:57,700
Good heavens! Me bounce?

1017
01:10:57,700 --> 01:11:00,500
Why, certainly!
Look, you've got the feet for it.

1018
01:11:00,500 --> 01:11:04,300
- I have?
- Sure. Come on, try it.

1019
01:11:04,400 --> 01:11:07,100
It makes you feel just g-g-great!

1020
01:11:07,100 --> 01:11:10,300
- Well, say, it does, doesn't it?
- Yes, it does.

1021
01:11:10,500 --> 01:11:15,400
- Well, come on, everybody, bounce!
- Come on, bounce.

1022
01:11:15,500 --> 01:11:19,200
The wonderful thing about tiggers
is tiggers are wonderful things

1023
01:11:19,300 --> 01:11:21,800
Their tops are made out of rubber
Their bottoms are made out of springs

1024
01:11:21,900 --> 01:11:24,600
They're bouncy, trouncy, flouncy
pouncy fun, fun, fun, fun, fun

1025
01:11:24,700 --> 01:11:27,100
But the most wonderful thing
about tiggers is I'm the only one

1026
01:11:27,200 --> 01:11:29,400
I'm the only one

1027
01:11:35,800 --> 01:11:38,600
And so, we come to the last chapter...

1028
01:11:38,600 --> 01:11:43,100
in which Christopher Robin and Pooh
come to the enchanted place...

1029
01:11:43,200 --> 01:11:45,600
- And we say good-bye.
- Good-bye?

1030
01:11:45,700 --> 01:11:49,500
Oh, no, please, can't we go back
to page one and do it all over again?

1031
01:11:49,600 --> 01:11:53,800
Sorry, Pooh, but all stories
have an ending, you know.

1032
01:11:53,800 --> 01:11:55,800
Oh, bother.

1033
01:11:55,900 --> 01:11:58,500
Yes, the time had come at last.

1034
01:11:58,500 --> 01:12:01,500
Christopher Robin
was going away to school.

1035
01:12:01,600 --> 01:12:06,000
Nobody else in the forest knew
exactly why or where he was going.

1036
01:12:06,100 --> 01:12:10,700
All they knew was it had something
to do with "twice times"...

1037
01:12:10,800 --> 01:12:14,200
and how to make things
called "A-B-C's"...

1038
01:12:14,200 --> 01:12:18,500
and where a place called Brazil is.

1039
01:12:19,800 --> 01:12:21,800
- Pooh?
- Huh?

1040
01:12:21,900 --> 01:12:25,400
What do you like doing
best in the world?

1041
01:12:25,400 --> 01:12:28,400
What I like best
is me going to visit you...

1042
01:12:28,400 --> 01:12:33,300
and you saying,
"How about a smackerel of honey?"

1043
01:12:33,400 --> 01:12:35,900
I like that too.

1044
01:12:35,900 --> 01:12:39,300
But what I like best
is just doing nothing.

1045
01:12:39,400 --> 01:12:43,000
- How do you do "just nothing"?
- Well...

1046
01:12:43,000 --> 01:12:46,300
it's when grown-ups ask,
"What are you going to do?"

1047
01:12:46,300 --> 01:12:50,100
And you say, "nothing."
Then you go out and do it.

1048
01:12:50,100 --> 01:12:52,500
I like that.
Let's do it all the time.

1049
01:12:52,600 --> 01:12:55,600
You know something, Pooh...

1050
01:12:55,700 --> 01:12:58,300
I'm not going to do
just nothing anymore.

1051
01:12:58,400 --> 01:13:00,400
You mean, never again?

1052
01:13:00,500 --> 01:13:03,000
Well, not so much.

1053
01:13:03,100 --> 01:13:05,100
Pooh...

1054
01:13:05,200 --> 01:13:07,700
when I'm away
just doing nothing...

1055
01:13:07,800 --> 01:13:09,800
will you come up here sometimes?

1056
01:13:09,800 --> 01:13:12,400
You mean, alone?

1057
01:13:12,500 --> 01:13:14,900
- Just me?
- Yes.

1058
01:13:15,000 --> 01:13:18,500
And, Pooh, promise
you won't forget me...

1059
01:13:18,600 --> 01:13:21,600
- Ever?
- Oh, I won't, Christopher, I promise.

1060
01:13:21,700 --> 01:13:23,900
Not even when I'm a hundred?

1061
01:13:23,900 --> 01:13:26,200
How old shall I be then?

1062
01:13:26,300 --> 01:13:28,400
Ninety-nine.

1063
01:13:28,400 --> 01:13:30,600
Silly old bear.

1064
01:13:30,700 --> 01:13:32,900
Wherever they go...

1065
01:13:33,000 --> 01:13:36,000
and whatever happens
to them on the way...

1066
01:13:36,000 --> 01:13:39,700
in that enchanted place
