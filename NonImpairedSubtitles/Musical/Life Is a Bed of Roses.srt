1
00:02:26,400 --> 00:02:27,913
Love...

2
00:02:37,720 --> 00:02:39,517
They're all here.

3
00:02:46,240 --> 00:02:49,516
I nearly didn't make it...
I only got the invitation Thursday.

4
00:02:49,720 --> 00:02:51,278
We had to alter our plans.

5
00:03:02,040 --> 00:03:03,712
We must be in Siberia!

6
00:03:04,200 --> 00:03:07,237
No, madame,
it's the Ardennes Forest.

7
00:03:19,680 --> 00:03:20,795
Jean!

8
00:03:24,960 --> 00:03:26,359
Yes, ma'am.

9
00:03:31,480 --> 00:03:32,959
Is she dead?

10
00:03:33,160 --> 00:03:36,914
It was before that. In the 80s...

11
00:03:37,320 --> 00:03:38,958
He has no sense of direction.

12
00:03:39,160 --> 00:03:41,549
Unfortunate, for a chauffeur!

13
00:03:52,760 --> 00:03:54,113
Well, Forbek,

14
00:03:55,000 --> 00:03:55,750
here we are.

15
00:03:59,480 --> 00:04:00,515
Thanks for coming!

16
00:04:06,960 --> 00:04:09,076
Raoul, my friend!

17
00:04:12,080 --> 00:04:14,719
Livia! Come!

18
00:04:28,560 --> 00:04:30,391
- May l, sir?
- No.

19
00:04:37,200 --> 00:04:38,553
My friends,

20
00:04:39,200 --> 00:04:42,158
for you are all old, dear friends.

21
00:04:43,000 --> 00:04:45,230
Whether we were school mates,

22
00:04:45,440 --> 00:04:47,351
or met in some distant land,

23
00:04:47,920 --> 00:04:51,151
over the years,
we've traded ideas and plans.

24
00:04:51,360 --> 00:04:52,793
I know some of yours.

25
00:04:53,360 --> 00:04:56,432
You all know the one
I've always cherished.

26
00:04:56,640 --> 00:05:00,394
that dream,
thanks to a stroke of fate,

27
00:05:00,600 --> 00:05:02,397
the death of a loved one,

28
00:05:03,120 --> 00:05:05,076
can now come true, right here!

29
00:05:08,360 --> 00:05:10,396
I bought the land,
the woods around it.

30
00:05:10,600 --> 00:05:12,636
Work will begin in a month.

31
00:05:12,840 --> 00:05:14,876
Our friend Patinier did the plans.

32
00:05:16,360 --> 00:05:17,713
What do you mean?

33
00:05:27,280 --> 00:05:29,032
Is it a castle, a palace?

34
00:05:29,240 --> 00:05:31,834
A palace... a castle...

35
00:05:32,360 --> 00:05:35,397
A castle/ More like a temple...

36
00:05:36,600 --> 00:05:38,830
the temple of happiness...

37
00:05:42,040 --> 00:05:43,393
Livia...

38
00:05:45,400 --> 00:05:46,628
My friend.

39
00:05:46,840 --> 00:05:49,229
Since you'll be its priestess,

40
00:05:50,600 --> 00:05:51,919
you do it.

41
00:06:34,080 --> 00:06:37,629
Model for Michel Forbek.

42
00:06:51,280 --> 00:06:54,352
This will be your home
as well as mine.

43
00:06:55,360 --> 00:06:58,670
When it's finished,
we'll meet for a huge party,

44
00:06:58,960 --> 00:07:01,997
and we'll celebrate my marriage
to my chosen,

45
00:07:02,200 --> 00:07:05,431
my beloved fiancée, Livia!

46
00:07:19,160 --> 00:07:21,435
Saturday, January 3, 1914.

47
00:08:25,480 --> 00:08:26,708
Come back soon!

48
00:08:27,520 --> 00:08:28,953
Be good.

49
00:08:29,280 --> 00:08:30,793
Good-bye.

50
00:10:03,320 --> 00:10:05,709
You're sure this isn't too fast?.
Because...

51
00:10:05,920 --> 00:10:10,436
Don't worry, Miss Rousseau.
Besides, we're there.

52
00:10:12,400 --> 00:10:13,753
So that's it.

53
00:10:17,760 --> 00:10:20,479
I'm told Mrs. Holberg's method
is interesting.

54
00:10:21,360 --> 00:10:24,557
It's... different,

55
00:10:25,840 --> 00:10:29,230
a modern idea.
The kids don't do any work.

56
00:10:29,440 --> 00:10:31,795
One pays, too...
And through the nose...

57
00:10:32,400 --> 00:10:34,550
It's not for our kids.

58
00:10:50,560 --> 00:10:51,879
Will you teach here?

59
00:10:52,080 --> 00:10:55,709
No, it's a private school.
I'm a public-school teacher.

60
00:10:56,280 --> 00:11:00,671
We're taking part in a sort
of conference on education.

61
00:11:01,480 --> 00:11:04,552
I'm taking advantage
of the All Saints holiday.

62
00:11:04,920 --> 00:11:09,118
Old-timers still call it the castle,
as they did 60 years ago.

63
00:11:09,760 --> 00:11:11,637
It never got finished!

64
00:11:11,840 --> 00:11:13,398
They began it before 1914,

65
00:11:14,360 --> 00:11:17,670
then the war came,
and they ran out of money,

66
00:11:17,880 --> 00:11:19,472
and that's how it was left.

67
00:11:20,120 --> 00:11:22,076
My dad knew the guy who built it:

68
00:11:22,280 --> 00:11:26,239
a foreigner... Peruvian, Yugoslav,
I don't know.

69
00:11:26,440 --> 00:11:30,911
He had mines...
Gold, oil, diamonds, I never knew.

70
00:11:31,120 --> 00:11:33,076
Lots of people came to see it,

71
00:11:33,440 --> 00:11:38,036
socialites, magnificent women:
Don't see that kind any more.

72
00:11:38,440 --> 00:11:41,113
Then he left.
The place was deserted.

73
00:11:41,320 --> 00:11:45,711
In 36, it was a youth hostel.
The Gestapo had it during the war.

74
00:11:46,160 --> 00:11:48,196
Now it's Mrs. Holberg's school.

75
00:11:48,880 --> 00:11:51,758
I'd like to give this conference
a tone...

76
00:12:08,680 --> 00:12:10,159
My dear Elizabeth!

77
00:12:11,600 --> 00:12:12,669
Georges!

78
00:12:14,440 --> 00:12:15,953
How's your mother?

79
00:12:16,520 --> 00:12:18,511
We're waiting for the lab results.

80
00:12:19,120 --> 00:12:22,078
Come meet some of our friends.

81
00:12:26,320 --> 00:12:29,471
Robert Dufresne, our guardian angel.

82
00:12:29,680 --> 00:12:32,797
He arranged for us
to have our seminar

83
00:12:33,000 --> 00:12:35,468
in this remarkable building,

84
00:12:35,680 --> 00:12:39,992
typical of early 20th century
symbolist architecture.

85
00:12:41,280 --> 00:12:42,190
Elizabeth Rousseau,

86
00:12:42,720 --> 00:12:45,951
a teacher
whose ideas will surprise you.

87
00:12:46,920 --> 00:12:49,434
Welcome
to "Imagination of Education"...

88
00:12:50,840 --> 00:12:52,671
Oops! Reverse that.

89
00:12:54,680 --> 00:12:56,272
He likes to horse around.

90
00:12:56,480 --> 00:12:57,435
Rev. Jean Watelet.

91
00:12:58,160 --> 00:12:58,956
Father...

92
00:12:59,560 --> 00:13:00,913
Call me Jean.

93
00:13:02,600 --> 00:13:03,669
We need a hand here.

94
00:13:04,400 --> 00:13:05,549
Well, Robert!

95
00:13:09,560 --> 00:13:12,279
Light as a feather.
Your toilet articles?

96
00:13:19,280 --> 00:13:22,636
Jean! Watch out for your back!

97
00:13:24,120 --> 00:13:26,918
Careful! Not so high!

98
00:13:29,840 --> 00:13:32,798
Easy does it. Be careful!

99
00:13:40,680 --> 00:13:42,272
Mr. Dufresne!

100
00:13:43,760 --> 00:13:45,955
Must I remind you of the agreement?

101
00:13:46,720 --> 00:13:50,713
You can't bring "that"
into the castle.

102
00:13:52,120 --> 00:13:54,111
Dear Mrs. Holberg...

103
00:13:54,320 --> 00:13:56,311
Ladies, gentlemen, young folk,

104
00:13:56,520 --> 00:13:59,637
sorry to seem inhospitable.

105
00:13:59,840 --> 00:14:02,513
But does liberty consist

106
00:14:02,720 --> 00:14:05,632
in ignoring our rights and duties?.

107
00:14:05,960 --> 00:14:08,599
This needed saying.
Now I've said it.

108
00:14:08,800 --> 00:14:11,917
There remains the more agreeable task

109
00:14:12,120 --> 00:14:14,793
of bidding you welcome.

110
00:14:16,840 --> 00:14:19,513
Mrs. Holberg, who heads our school.

111
00:14:19,760 --> 00:14:23,309
We must understand each other.
Our methods may differ.

112
00:14:23,520 --> 00:14:24,669
We've a common aim:

113
00:14:24,880 --> 00:14:28,156
to turn children into men
worthy of the name,

114
00:14:28,360 --> 00:14:32,592
a new breed who may make this world
"of sound and fury"

115
00:14:32,800 --> 00:14:35,598
into one of beauty, harmony, love.

116
00:14:36,000 --> 00:14:37,149
Where do we put it?

117
00:14:38,440 --> 00:14:39,555
Leave it outside!

118
00:14:40,040 --> 00:14:41,996
You can't do that.

119
00:14:42,320 --> 00:14:44,675
In the dining hall?
The conservatory?.

120
00:14:44,880 --> 00:14:47,440
Miss Obertin, stay out of this.

121
00:14:47,640 --> 00:14:51,474
It's between the conference
and the school.

122
00:14:51,680 --> 00:14:52,749
You teach here.

123
00:14:52,960 --> 00:14:55,155
So I'm attending the conference.

124
00:14:55,360 --> 00:14:58,113
That's only one of your duties.

125
00:14:58,480 --> 00:15:02,439
You're minding the children staying
on over the holiday. Well, do it!

126
00:15:02,640 --> 00:15:03,834
There are only 3. I can...

127
00:15:04,040 --> 00:15:06,952
I'm tired of having to repeat this:

128
00:15:07,160 --> 00:15:09,754
true liberty...

129
00:15:13,640 --> 00:15:15,312
It's Walter Guarini!

130
00:15:15,880 --> 00:15:19,031
It's Guarini!

131
00:15:19,520 --> 00:15:21,750
Walter Guarini...

132
00:15:45,400 --> 00:15:46,719
Georges Leroux?.

133
00:15:47,720 --> 00:15:49,438
You're like your writing.

134
00:15:49,640 --> 00:15:51,039
My letters were typed.

135
00:15:51,240 --> 00:15:55,677
I meant, you're like
your letter-writing style.

136
00:16:00,120 --> 00:16:01,473
What trash!

137
00:16:01,680 --> 00:16:02,749
How's that?

138
00:16:02,960 --> 00:16:04,791
Is that thing edible?.

139
00:16:05,200 --> 00:16:06,679
Can you eat it?.

140
00:16:06,880 --> 00:16:07,517
What?

141
00:16:07,720 --> 00:16:11,554
It's not architecture, it's pastry.

142
00:16:12,680 --> 00:16:17,231
Thanks for coming. I'm very happy.

143
00:16:17,560 --> 00:16:19,596
I was determined to have you here.

144
00:16:19,800 --> 00:16:23,998
You confer a wider scope
on our conference:

145
00:16:24,200 --> 00:16:26,953
interdisciplinary...
and international.

146
00:16:27,160 --> 00:16:29,151
I haven't received my check yet.

147
00:16:29,480 --> 00:16:31,198
Where's Nora? Not here yet?.

148
00:16:31,400 --> 00:16:33,550
Nora Winkle? She'll be here soon.

149
00:16:33,760 --> 00:16:34,829
Fine.

150
00:16:35,120 --> 00:16:37,190
Dear friends, let us be proud.

151
00:16:37,760 --> 00:16:39,512
We have with us the man

152
00:16:39,720 --> 00:16:44,271
who may change people
by changing their cities.

153
00:16:51,400 --> 00:16:54,517
Mrs. Holberg,
who devised the Holberg method.

154
00:16:54,720 --> 00:16:56,836
Welcome to Holberg!

155
00:16:57,040 --> 00:17:01,431
Hans Siegfried Holberg! I envy you
for having known that great man,

156
00:17:01,640 --> 00:17:04,916
but I envy him more
because you were his wife.

157
00:17:05,120 --> 00:17:07,236
- What now/
- Careful! I'm letting go.

158
00:17:07,440 --> 00:17:08,589
Don't fool around.

159
00:17:08,800 --> 00:17:11,917
Go on, don't just stand there.

160
00:17:12,200 --> 00:17:16,113
Back to work! inside you go!
I'll be right with you.

161
00:17:17,880 --> 00:17:20,075
Careful, children! Cross in front.

162
00:17:22,280 --> 00:17:25,511
Mrs. Holberg... Natalie. See?.
I even know your first name.

163
00:17:25,720 --> 00:17:27,517
- Excuse me.
- Of course.

164
00:17:33,880 --> 00:17:36,758
Thanks, sir. I'm very grateful.

165
00:19:10,280 --> 00:19:12,953
5 years ago, I thought I'd marry

166
00:19:13,160 --> 00:19:15,628
on the day I opened this house.

167
00:19:16,480 --> 00:19:18,789
Men's folly dictated otherwise.

168
00:19:20,040 --> 00:19:24,033
How many of those who worked
on my project are still alive?.

169
00:19:24,760 --> 00:19:27,354
How many died atrociously?

170
00:19:28,360 --> 00:19:31,158
First, the architect,

171
00:19:31,360 --> 00:19:34,670
Patinier, killed in the battle
of Charleroi.

172
00:19:36,000 --> 00:19:39,356
Laferrière, killed on the Somme.
Marquet, Grumbet...

173
00:19:40,280 --> 00:19:43,989
Trévoux, killed in '17 at Salonika.

174
00:19:49,120 --> 00:19:53,671
Empires have fallen, fortunes,
including mine, dwindled.

175
00:19:54,560 --> 00:19:57,996
The woman I was to marry
wed another.

176
00:20:08,080 --> 00:20:10,640
I've traveled... a lot.

177
00:20:12,200 --> 00:20:15,749
I almost dropped the project
100 times.

178
00:20:15,960 --> 00:20:19,430
It still isn't finished.

179
00:20:20,000 --> 00:20:24,039
But it is urgent to consecrate
this temple of happiness.

180
00:20:26,040 --> 00:20:27,712
A new kind of happiness!

181
00:20:28,320 --> 00:20:29,958
A new happiness?

182
00:20:30,400 --> 00:20:31,799
Then it's a celebration.

183
00:20:34,000 --> 00:20:37,197
More like an... experiment.

184
00:20:38,480 --> 00:20:40,835
Perhaps we should say, a journey.

185
00:20:42,640 --> 00:20:45,029
Although we won't leave here.

186
00:20:45,600 --> 00:20:47,830
This is going to be fun.

187
00:20:49,160 --> 00:20:53,392
If the palace isn't finished,
why not postpone things?

188
00:20:53,600 --> 00:20:55,477
To when the paint is dry?

189
00:20:55,920 --> 00:20:57,911
I could wait no longer.

190
00:20:58,160 --> 00:21:01,152
You were wounded in the war?
So was l.

191
00:21:01,360 --> 00:21:03,396
My soul was deeply wounded.

192
00:21:05,240 --> 00:21:07,356
I waited, and waited.

193
00:21:07,560 --> 00:21:11,439
I tried to still my pain,
but I can't stand it any more.

194
00:21:13,080 --> 00:21:15,548
I know I'm not the only one.

195
00:21:16,280 --> 00:21:19,352
That's why I chose you,

196
00:21:20,040 --> 00:21:24,556
because you're my friends.
I know you.

197
00:21:26,200 --> 00:21:28,509
Aren't we all wounded animals,

198
00:21:28,720 --> 00:21:31,393
Locking our teeth to keep
from howling?.

199
00:21:32,080 --> 00:21:35,993
Four years of suffering
made us murderers.

200
00:21:36,600 --> 00:21:38,989
Of all the ties that bind us,

201
00:21:39,640 --> 00:21:42,950
isn't this the strongest?.

202
00:21:43,560 --> 00:21:44,959
What does he want?

203
00:21:45,160 --> 00:21:48,869
It's a game... He's having fun...

204
00:21:49,080 --> 00:21:51,036
We must laugh...

205
00:21:51,560 --> 00:21:52,834
And harmony?

206
00:21:55,800 --> 00:21:59,110
Harmony...

207
00:22:01,520 --> 00:22:04,830
Does harmony reign among us?.

208
00:22:05,560 --> 00:22:07,312
Not at all.

209
00:22:07,600 --> 00:22:10,956
Harmony has fled from this world
forever.

210
00:22:11,920 --> 00:22:14,639
Nothing and no one
are in their proper place.

211
00:22:15,080 --> 00:22:17,469
That's why we're all unhappy.

212
00:22:19,000 --> 00:22:21,878
Failure, betrayal,

213
00:22:22,880 --> 00:22:24,598
Lost illusions,

214
00:22:25,160 --> 00:22:28,072
unfulfilled desires, plans awry.

215
00:22:28,920 --> 00:22:32,276
One man may be fooled
into thinking his wife loves him.

216
00:22:32,480 --> 00:22:35,153
She's sought by another,
but loves a third.

217
00:22:37,880 --> 00:22:39,393
Isn't that so, Jeannetier?

218
00:22:41,920 --> 00:22:44,514
One is indecently rich:

219
00:22:45,120 --> 00:22:46,792
Not so, Garcin?

220
00:22:49,160 --> 00:22:52,596
Another is indecently poor.

221
00:22:53,040 --> 00:22:57,352
Ashamed, one hides his wealth,

222
00:22:57,560 --> 00:23:00,279
the other his poverty.
Right, Zimmerman?

223
00:23:01,800 --> 00:23:06,157
One mother here hates her children,
and it pains her.

224
00:23:06,440 --> 00:23:09,591
A son wishes his mother dead,
and it pains him.

225
00:23:09,800 --> 00:23:12,394
A doctor is pained
by his incompetence.

226
00:23:12,600 --> 00:23:14,909
You all suffer, you weep,
all of you.

227
00:23:15,120 --> 00:23:16,712
Enough! Enough!

228
00:23:30,280 --> 00:23:32,919
My coat! My car! My hat!
We're going!

229
00:23:33,120 --> 00:23:35,315
I'm leaving!
My car! my coat! My hat!

230
00:23:35,520 --> 00:23:37,636
I'll hold no one here.

231
00:23:38,360 --> 00:23:41,875
For this experiment,
I'll need your total submission,

232
00:23:42,880 --> 00:23:44,996
your absolute trust.

233
00:23:45,880 --> 00:23:47,791
So leave, go quickly!

234
00:23:49,520 --> 00:23:50,919
If you stay,

235
00:23:51,760 --> 00:23:54,672
you'll be here for many weeks,

236
00:23:55,640 --> 00:23:58,029
cut off from the outside

237
00:23:58,360 --> 00:24:02,831
Like a caterpillar in a cocoon,
walled in,

238
00:24:03,600 --> 00:24:07,798
doors, windows so shut
no light can enter, no visitors.

239
00:24:08,920 --> 00:24:10,956
Your souls

240
00:24:11,720 --> 00:24:15,030
and minds must be sealed off too,

241
00:24:16,520 --> 00:24:20,559
until you are born again

242
00:24:21,680 --> 00:24:24,433
the day of your rebirth.

243
00:24:26,640 --> 00:24:29,313
We'll remake human understanding,

244
00:24:29,520 --> 00:24:33,308
shame 30 centuries of idiocy
and disorder,

245
00:24:33,600 --> 00:24:37,798
bring harmony to this
and future generations,

246
00:24:38,120 --> 00:24:41,032
restore the harmony we've lost.

247
00:24:44,160 --> 00:24:46,628
But you, Livia?.

248
00:24:50,240 --> 00:24:52,993
Me? I'm happy.

249
00:24:53,600 --> 00:24:54,589
Are you sure?

250
00:24:57,080 --> 00:24:58,069
Why are you staying?

251
00:24:59,560 --> 00:25:00,595
We're your friends.

252
00:25:01,160 --> 00:25:02,593
If you stay...

253
00:25:07,160 --> 00:25:09,549
Close up! Doors, windows,
everything.

254
00:26:20,400 --> 00:26:23,517
Hi, children.
Is Forbek Castle far from here?

255
00:26:24,800 --> 00:26:25,994
The school...

256
00:26:27,200 --> 00:26:29,714
Holberg institute, the Academy,
if you prefer.

257
00:26:30,280 --> 00:26:33,158
It's not far: straight ahead,
then left.

258
00:26:33,600 --> 00:26:35,875
Thanks. You're very sweet.

259
00:27:19,200 --> 00:27:21,998
- What'd she say?.
- You put your head in garbage.

260
00:27:23,080 --> 00:27:26,231
It's a dodgem hat to use
on our enemies.

261
00:27:32,440 --> 00:27:34,271
Show her, Frederic.

262
00:27:45,160 --> 00:27:47,594
Our enemies,
the shit makers who shit all over,

263
00:27:47,880 --> 00:27:50,394
who bug us,
break our things, trip us.

264
00:27:50,760 --> 00:27:52,637
Who eat the cake
and leave us the soup.

265
00:27:53,000 --> 00:27:55,275
The bad kings who kill,
and the thieves,

266
00:27:55,600 --> 00:27:58,114
those who burn houses,
and make us cry.

267
00:28:01,520 --> 00:28:04,592
Vermin gnaws the earth...

268
00:28:04,800 --> 00:28:07,997
Everything is dirty
and smells bad...

269
00:28:08,440 --> 00:28:13,036
It rains all the time

270
00:28:14,680 --> 00:28:17,797
Some people eat cake,

271
00:28:18,000 --> 00:28:20,833
and most of us eat soup,

272
00:28:21,040 --> 00:28:25,033
made of nettles and noodles...

273
00:28:25,560 --> 00:28:29,678
Honest folk are in jail,
they're tortured,

274
00:28:29,880 --> 00:28:33,316
and robbed, children are killed,

275
00:28:33,520 --> 00:28:37,798
and murderers are rich and powerful,

276
00:28:38,000 --> 00:28:42,118
and rule the kingdom...

277
00:28:43,840 --> 00:28:46,877
It is dark, and all that's heard

278
00:28:47,080 --> 00:28:53,838
is the rain falling
and the poor folk weeping...

279
00:28:59,880 --> 00:29:04,556
But your day has come,
it will all change...

280
00:29:05,360 --> 00:29:09,069
Go, now you are big, you are strong.

281
00:29:09,280 --> 00:29:16,118
Restore justice,
happiness and harmony.

282
00:29:16,320 --> 00:29:21,348
Take the money the rich man stole,

283
00:29:21,760 --> 00:29:26,914
and give it to the poor,
for you're the true king...

284
00:29:27,200 --> 00:29:32,035
Then there will be
no more dust or dirt...

285
00:29:32,240 --> 00:29:36,631
Then everyone will eat cake
every day...

286
00:29:37,080 --> 00:29:41,596
We'll never be cold,
or have toothaches...

287
00:29:41,800 --> 00:29:46,555
No one will fall down
and people will live 100 years...

288
00:29:46,760 --> 00:29:48,876
Go!

289
00:29:55,920 --> 00:30:00,914
The age of happiness is beginning...

290
00:30:32,680 --> 00:30:35,399
But a city
of all possible happiness.

291
00:30:35,600 --> 00:30:38,433
We must teach children
to imagine that city.

292
00:30:41,280 --> 00:30:45,034
And, first,
to build schools that move:

293
00:30:45,240 --> 00:30:48,949
Mobile, shifting, undisciplined,

294
00:30:49,360 --> 00:30:52,432
from which children can take off.

295
00:30:52,640 --> 00:30:55,473
Not to conquer the world as it is,

296
00:30:55,680 --> 00:30:59,309
but to build... to invent...

297
00:30:59,520 --> 00:31:03,957
a new world
that is what it should be.

298
00:31:04,760 --> 00:31:05,988
These schools of the future

299
00:31:06,200 --> 00:31:10,432
should not be knowledge factories,

300
00:31:10,760 --> 00:31:12,512
but workshops of creativity.

301
00:31:12,720 --> 00:31:16,395
As Giuseppe Verdi said:

302
00:31:16,960 --> 00:31:19,235
Copying what's true
may be good,

303
00:31:19,440 --> 00:31:23,115
but inventing it
is far better.

304
00:31:29,840 --> 00:31:31,273
Your turn, Father.

305
00:31:33,480 --> 00:31:34,708
First of all,

306
00:31:36,240 --> 00:31:38,879
I'd like to remark to Guarini

307
00:31:39,080 --> 00:31:43,631
that to me the Verdi quotation
is meaningless.

308
00:31:44,680 --> 00:31:48,719
Jean, forget Verdi
and introduce yourself...

309
00:31:48,920 --> 00:31:52,629
to those who know you
only by reputation.

310
00:31:53,880 --> 00:31:56,189
Jean Watelet is a Catholic priest

311
00:31:56,480 --> 00:31:59,358
and he's against all schools.

312
00:32:01,080 --> 00:32:04,675
Juliette Watelet,
the priest's sister.

313
00:32:05,160 --> 00:32:07,833
I believe in computers, not in God.

314
00:32:08,240 --> 00:32:09,753
I also believe in schools.

315
00:32:10,080 --> 00:32:12,469
I'll show you how computers...

316
00:32:12,680 --> 00:32:16,070
When will you show me
your true face?.

317
00:32:18,920 --> 00:32:21,753
I don't understand, Mr. Guarini.
Which face?.

318
00:32:21,960 --> 00:32:22,790
Call me Walter.

319
00:32:23,000 --> 00:32:23,910
Not true!

320
00:32:24,280 --> 00:32:28,239
You can't reach the real world
via a computer terminal.

321
00:32:28,800 --> 00:32:32,679
The face of a girl who will show me
a real smile.

322
00:32:34,320 --> 00:32:35,673
I smile.

323
00:32:36,120 --> 00:32:38,714
Yes, all the time. Far too much.

324
00:32:39,800 --> 00:32:42,792
At everyone,
and no one in particular.

325
00:32:43,000 --> 00:32:43,989
You only have 2 eyes,

326
00:32:44,200 --> 00:32:46,395
blind to infrared or ultraviolet.

327
00:32:46,600 --> 00:32:49,239
My class doesn't need computers.

328
00:32:49,800 --> 00:32:51,950
I teach a kindergarten class.

329
00:32:52,160 --> 00:32:54,116
I let a child live his life.

330
00:32:55,040 --> 00:32:57,031
You don't exhort a rose to bloom.

331
00:32:57,240 --> 00:32:59,708
Words and ideas grow like teeth.

332
00:33:00,200 --> 00:33:01,030
My teeth ache.

333
00:33:01,240 --> 00:33:03,071
No roses without a gardener.

334
00:33:03,400 --> 00:33:06,949
I see we agree on a common goal:

335
00:33:07,160 --> 00:33:09,549
developing the faculties

336
00:33:10,080 --> 00:33:13,152
and happiness of our children.

337
00:33:13,640 --> 00:33:14,629
Bravo!

338
00:33:15,520 --> 00:33:19,638
Instead of mocking us,
introduce yourself:

339
00:33:20,600 --> 00:33:24,354
Robert Dufresne,
our secretary-treasurer,

340
00:33:24,560 --> 00:33:27,074
a specialist in children's games

341
00:33:27,280 --> 00:33:31,114
and their role
in developing intelligence.

342
00:33:40,480 --> 00:33:42,072
The Jesus child...

343
00:33:52,640 --> 00:33:53,914
Bravo, Robet!

344
00:33:54,480 --> 00:33:57,199
You have perfectly conveyed

345
00:33:57,680 --> 00:33:59,636
the substance of your work.

346
00:34:00,280 --> 00:34:04,432
It might be shocking,
but I find it very original,

347
00:34:04,920 --> 00:34:07,992
very modern. Yes, modern.

348
00:34:08,640 --> 00:34:10,756
So you think that's modern.

349
00:34:10,960 --> 00:34:13,269
Well, I don't! Not at all.

350
00:34:13,480 --> 00:34:17,268
I'm not arguing with it.
I approve, I cheer it.

351
00:34:17,480 --> 00:34:20,916
It's a return to the source
of the imaginary,

352
00:34:21,120 --> 00:34:22,951
to a tribal culture.

353
00:34:23,160 --> 00:34:24,593
Culture needs language.

354
00:34:25,240 --> 00:34:27,037
I don't mean to skip language,

355
00:34:27,240 --> 00:34:29,276
but what's needed...

356
00:34:39,800 --> 00:34:43,395
Nora Winkle is with us.

357
00:34:43,800 --> 00:34:47,315
She dared masquerade as a man,

358
00:34:47,520 --> 00:34:51,195
and work
in minus-81 degree temperature

359
00:34:51,400 --> 00:34:53,550
in Canada

360
00:34:53,760 --> 00:34:56,354
to write the revolutionary report:

361
00:34:56,840 --> 00:35:00,196
"The Sexual Fantasies
of James Bay Workmen".

362
00:35:00,960 --> 00:35:01,870
Thanks,

363
00:35:03,320 --> 00:35:04,753
and good morning.

364
00:35:06,240 --> 00:35:07,878
Delighted.

365
00:35:16,760 --> 00:35:20,753
I left my daughter in the garbage.

366
00:35:22,440 --> 00:35:24,317
Follow me. It's this way.

367
00:35:39,320 --> 00:35:41,709
- Who was that?.
- Queen Shitface and her army.

368
00:35:41,920 --> 00:35:46,118
It's forbidden to look at her...
Or soldiers bury you up to your neck,

369
00:35:46,320 --> 00:35:48,595
and put out your eyes
with a teaspoon.

370
00:35:48,800 --> 00:35:50,552
Come on. We can go now.

371
00:35:53,520 --> 00:35:55,829
It's a castle.
But don't tell anyone.

372
00:35:56,040 --> 00:35:59,510
It was built 100 000 years ago
by a bloodthirsty king.

373
00:36:56,720 --> 00:36:58,915
Didn't we meet at Forbek's?

374
00:36:59,120 --> 00:37:02,396
No matter. In a few moments,
we'll forget everything,

375
00:37:02,600 --> 00:37:05,512
as if we'd never existed.

376
00:37:05,720 --> 00:37:09,554
Never existed?
That's hard to imagine...

377
00:37:09,800 --> 00:37:12,997
But we'll be reborn, my friends!

378
00:37:23,680 --> 00:37:25,750
Thank you, friends.

379
00:37:27,720 --> 00:37:29,438
By changing clothes,

380
00:37:29,640 --> 00:37:32,677
you've cast off part
of your old selves.

381
00:37:34,080 --> 00:37:38,198
A potion prepared
by Thi-Lan will be passed around.

382
00:37:39,640 --> 00:37:42,677
It's made of drugs
unknown in Europe.

383
00:37:43,120 --> 00:37:46,032
You'll go
into a sleep of forgetfulness.

384
00:37:46,800 --> 00:37:50,918
You won't know who you are...
You'll all be equal,

385
00:37:51,760 --> 00:37:54,513
Like a child in its mother's womb.

386
00:37:56,080 --> 00:38:00,517
And when you wake up, you'll
rediscover, in all their freshness,

387
00:38:00,720 --> 00:38:03,871
the sensations of a newborn babe...

388
00:38:05,280 --> 00:38:09,637
We'll make sure they give you
only pleasure,

389
00:38:09,840 --> 00:38:11,159
and well being,

390
00:38:12,320 --> 00:38:14,470
and are not,
as in your previous birth,

391
00:38:14,680 --> 00:38:16,955
a source of pain,

392
00:38:17,520 --> 00:38:19,351
of being torn...

393
00:38:20,240 --> 00:38:22,629
Soon you'll be aware
of yourselves again.

394
00:38:23,480 --> 00:38:25,869
But you'll be a new person,

395
00:38:26,600 --> 00:38:29,160
pure, spotless,

396
00:38:30,400 --> 00:38:32,311
ready to meet others,

397
00:38:32,520 --> 00:38:35,557
who are just as pure and new...

398
00:39:39,280 --> 00:39:40,633
A question.

399
00:39:40,840 --> 00:39:41,875
Go right ahead.

400
00:39:42,080 --> 00:39:45,516
What's the point of all
these conventions, symposiums...

401
00:39:46,920 --> 00:39:48,035
Good point!

402
00:39:48,240 --> 00:39:49,559
Take the Third World:

403
00:39:49,760 --> 00:39:52,911
14 000 conferences a year!
And the people are starving!

404
00:39:53,400 --> 00:39:55,152
Any Statistics?.

405
00:39:55,960 --> 00:39:58,838
Let's have a conference
on conferences.

406
00:39:59,040 --> 00:40:00,678
The important thing
about conferences

407
00:40:00,880 --> 00:40:03,553
for men is no wives.

408
00:40:03,760 --> 00:40:05,591
And for women, no husbands...
Adventure.

409
00:40:05,800 --> 00:40:07,438
The extra-marital kind!

410
00:40:07,640 --> 00:40:10,518
All cultural
and scientific meeting are

411
00:40:10,720 --> 00:40:12,551
an excuse for the same old thing.

412
00:40:12,760 --> 00:40:14,557
Getting laid!

413
00:40:15,480 --> 00:40:19,155
I drink to sexo-cultural exchanges.

414
00:40:19,360 --> 00:40:21,510
To cultural ass-ociates.

415
00:40:21,720 --> 00:40:22,436
Come in.

416
00:40:26,080 --> 00:40:27,832
Aant to visit Nora?

417
00:40:28,560 --> 00:40:31,028
Let's help her move in...
So you get to meet her.

418
00:40:32,160 --> 00:40:33,479
Something wrong?

419
00:40:33,800 --> 00:40:35,074
I have to change.

420
00:40:35,280 --> 00:40:38,317
- You look fine.
- Think so? Nora...

421
00:40:38,520 --> 00:40:42,069
Nora Winkle? I had her
as a teacher in the states.

422
00:40:42,280 --> 00:40:46,068
One day she gave her class
in pajamas.

423
00:40:47,680 --> 00:40:50,274
Gentlemen, please be quiet.

424
00:40:50,480 --> 00:40:53,756
There are children
and elderly people who need sleep.

425
00:40:54,200 --> 00:40:57,749
Be more respectful
of yourselves and of others.

426
00:41:04,840 --> 00:41:05,909
Good night.

427
00:41:55,280 --> 00:41:58,397
Sit down. Don't stand there.

428
00:42:05,000 --> 00:42:05,750
Is it always like this?

429
00:42:06,520 --> 00:42:07,839
What?

430
00:42:08,320 --> 00:42:09,753
Conferences... seminars...

431
00:42:09,960 --> 00:42:13,555
It's my first time.

432
00:42:14,560 --> 00:42:16,949
Those ludicrous introductions...

433
00:42:17,160 --> 00:42:19,720
That bull-session in the next room.

434
00:42:19,920 --> 00:42:22,639
The things I heard!

435
00:42:22,840 --> 00:42:25,149
That's "men only" for you.

436
00:42:26,200 --> 00:42:29,715
They talk a lot of crap
and empty a few bottles.

437
00:42:30,720 --> 00:42:34,838
A tribal reflex...
Which we'll share in, too.

438
00:42:35,480 --> 00:42:36,674
If you'll sit down.

439
00:42:39,920 --> 00:42:41,672
You call that normal?.

440
00:42:47,640 --> 00:42:50,598
I'm no moralist.
I'm an anthropologist.

441
00:42:51,720 --> 00:42:53,392
Was Walter there?

442
00:42:53,600 --> 00:42:55,033
Of course!

443
00:42:55,720 --> 00:42:58,109
I think our friend interests him.

444
00:42:58,720 --> 00:43:01,996
That old lecher. It figures!

445
00:43:03,200 --> 00:43:07,079
I'm amazed that an architect
like Walter Guarini would indulge

446
00:43:07,280 --> 00:43:11,239
in the questionable humor
I just heard.

447
00:43:11,440 --> 00:43:13,908
Genius doesn't exclude vulgarity.

448
00:43:14,120 --> 00:43:15,712
I'd say it's pat of it.

449
00:43:15,920 --> 00:43:19,037
No one knows Guarini
better than you.

450
00:43:19,400 --> 00:43:21,038
I read a fine book on him.

451
00:43:21,240 --> 00:43:23,276
His ideas on classrooms.

452
00:43:23,480 --> 00:43:27,109
He's a great cook. As a lover,

453
00:43:27,400 --> 00:43:29,356
he's not as good as he claims.

454
00:43:30,880 --> 00:43:35,590
But I don't like men who are too
expert at love. Know what I mean?.

455
00:43:41,680 --> 00:43:44,274
No one takes anything seriously
here.

456
00:43:45,040 --> 00:43:49,556
Mr. Leroux, whom I respect,
and who organized this conference,

457
00:43:49,880 --> 00:43:54,271
invited Walter Guarini
because Guarini is someone.

458
00:43:55,520 --> 00:43:58,512
He's not a clown...
Like that guy making faces.

459
00:43:59,440 --> 00:44:02,591
That guy is my pal Robert.

460
00:44:03,400 --> 00:44:04,549
He's the organizer.

461
00:44:04,760 --> 00:44:08,309
Doesn't matter. You're all alike.

462
00:44:09,040 --> 00:44:11,759
My colleagues are the same,
always making fun.

463
00:44:13,760 --> 00:44:14,749
We have a job to do.

464
00:44:15,200 --> 00:44:16,713
Robert's not like that.

465
00:44:17,040 --> 00:44:18,712
A wonderful job!

466
00:44:19,080 --> 00:44:22,390
We form men, we build,
we create man with

467
00:44:22,600 --> 00:44:25,592
devotion... and love...
All our love.

468
00:44:29,320 --> 00:44:30,639
"Love"... is that word funny?.

469
00:44:31,760 --> 00:44:35,912
All big words make me laugh.

470
00:44:36,720 --> 00:44:40,156
I may know such and such a man.

471
00:44:41,400 --> 00:44:44,995
But "men", man in general,
what does it mean?.

472
00:44:47,480 --> 00:44:49,550
And love?

473
00:44:50,640 --> 00:44:52,471
What is "Love"?.

474
00:44:52,880 --> 00:44:55,838
Love isn't just "getting laid".

475
00:44:56,480 --> 00:44:59,233
People have "feelings".

476
00:45:00,160 --> 00:45:03,357
I believe in romantic love.

477
00:45:04,840 --> 00:45:07,718
I believe

478
00:45:07,920 --> 00:45:11,276
in love

479
00:45:11,680 --> 00:45:14,035
The love

480
00:45:14,240 --> 00:45:17,118
of married couples

481
00:45:17,320 --> 00:45:22,440
The love of lovers

482
00:45:22,760 --> 00:45:26,753
I believe in meetings

483
00:45:26,960 --> 00:45:32,159
in the union of the people

484
00:45:32,360 --> 00:45:34,999
who were meant for each other

485
00:45:35,200 --> 00:45:38,988
Who had always

486
00:45:39,200 --> 00:45:41,839
Looked for each other

487
00:45:42,200 --> 00:45:47,320
and finally found each other

488
00:45:47,960 --> 00:45:51,794
And then never again

489
00:45:52,000 --> 00:45:56,790
Never parted again

490
00:45:58,360 --> 00:46:02,512
Never again

491
00:46:02,720 --> 00:46:05,757
I believe

492
00:46:05,960 --> 00:46:08,872
in love

493
00:46:09,080 --> 00:46:13,835
In people who wait for each other

494
00:46:14,200 --> 00:46:19,228
Who finally find each other

495
00:46:20,000 --> 00:46:25,154
And then never part again

496
00:46:26,040 --> 00:46:29,350
Never again

497
00:46:29,920 --> 00:46:33,356
Never again

498
00:46:41,040 --> 00:46:42,314
"Love"...

499
00:46:43,240 --> 00:46:45,470
"Forever"... "never again"...

500
00:46:50,640 --> 00:46:52,915
Romantic love, my dear,

501
00:46:53,120 --> 00:46:56,112
is culturally quite recent.

502
00:46:56,400 --> 00:46:58,118
It's probably Arabian in origin

503
00:46:58,320 --> 00:47:00,550
and like all cultural phenomena,

504
00:47:00,760 --> 00:47:03,672
has a specific biological function,

505
00:47:04,200 --> 00:47:07,351
in this case, the survival
of our species.

506
00:47:08,400 --> 00:47:10,709
Blinded by romantic illusions,

507
00:47:10,920 --> 00:47:14,959
you can "Lay", as you say,
some absolutely "unlayable" people.

508
00:47:26,120 --> 00:47:30,159
It can strike you suddenly,
and be gone as fast.

509
00:47:31,200 --> 00:47:35,716
Depending on the circumstances,
the lighting, the packaging.

510
00:47:36,800 --> 00:47:38,597
Like in a supermarket:

511
00:47:38,800 --> 00:47:42,236
why favor one brand of detergent
or soap over another?

512
00:47:47,120 --> 00:47:51,159
The man I'll fall in love with

513
00:47:51,360 --> 00:47:55,558
Isn't a bar of soap.

514
00:47:55,760 --> 00:48:00,072
He is gentle and strong

515
00:48:00,280 --> 00:48:04,990
Gentle and strong

516
00:48:05,280 --> 00:48:07,475
I've known him

517
00:48:07,680 --> 00:48:12,674
I've always known him

518
00:48:12,920 --> 00:48:16,913
I always have

519
00:48:17,120 --> 00:48:22,240
I've always known him

520
00:48:35,120 --> 00:48:36,758
Just like a baby.

521
00:48:38,400 --> 00:48:40,038
Shall we put her to bed?.

522
00:48:40,560 --> 00:48:41,197
Yes, let's.

523
00:49:38,280 --> 00:49:39,952
Poor dear.

524
00:49:40,800 --> 00:49:42,950
"I wish you passionate love".

525
00:49:43,720 --> 00:49:47,474
You? You believe in true love?.

526
00:49:50,240 --> 00:49:51,912
I have a soft spot

527
00:49:53,320 --> 00:49:55,595
for those who do.

528
00:49:56,880 --> 00:49:59,269
Elizabeth is a real case.

529
00:50:01,160 --> 00:50:02,593
An interesting one.

530
00:50:06,200 --> 00:50:07,792
Want to bet?

531
00:50:11,440 --> 00:50:12,077
With me?

532
00:50:12,280 --> 00:50:15,033
With me, with you, with us.

533
00:50:16,280 --> 00:50:19,875
Of all the guys here,

534
00:50:20,600 --> 00:50:22,477
who's the biggest jerk?

535
00:50:24,440 --> 00:50:25,475
The kindergarten teacher?

536
00:50:28,600 --> 00:50:29,953
Your clown!

537
00:50:30,760 --> 00:50:31,715
Robet?

538
00:50:34,600 --> 00:50:36,795
I bet that
before the conference is over,

539
00:50:37,000 --> 00:50:40,629
Elizabeth falls madly in love
with your Robert.

540
00:50:40,880 --> 00:50:42,359
If we help a little...

541
00:50:43,800 --> 00:50:44,789
To prove what?

542
00:50:46,960 --> 00:50:50,191
That the word "Love" is plural.

543
00:50:53,280 --> 00:50:54,508
Poor Elizabeth!

544
00:50:56,520 --> 00:50:59,080
Or poor Robert/

545
00:51:00,000 --> 00:51:04,039
Go ahead and try.
I'm sure it won't work.

546
00:51:04,240 --> 00:51:06,629
I'm sure it will.

547
00:51:07,880 --> 00:51:10,189
It's all for her own good.

548
00:51:11,720 --> 00:51:15,190
We're opening her eyes
to make her happy.

549
00:51:17,240 --> 00:51:18,673
Hap-py!

550
00:51:34,440 --> 00:51:37,273
The world is an orchestra
and we're its musicians.

551
00:51:37,480 --> 00:51:40,677
So far we've all been assigned
the wrong score to play.

552
00:51:40,880 --> 00:51:43,758
So the world has been
one loud dissonance.

553
00:51:45,880 --> 00:51:50,476
But now we'll be reborn,
others will follow.

554
00:51:51,640 --> 00:51:55,599
Our dreams will come true,
our desires will be fulfilled,

555
00:51:55,800 --> 00:51:58,360
one's pleasure will be
everyone's pleasure.

556
00:51:58,600 --> 00:52:00,431
Instead of dissonance,

557
00:52:00,640 --> 00:52:03,552
we'll hear wonderful symphonies.

558
00:52:04,400 --> 00:52:07,551
With you as their conductor!

559
00:52:27,840 --> 00:52:28,431
Listen!

560
00:52:28,840 --> 00:52:33,038
The concert is beginning.

561
00:52:34,160 --> 00:52:37,311
The birth of a new world.

562
00:52:52,280 --> 00:52:53,793
First taste...

563
00:52:54,200 --> 00:52:58,751
Then smell, touch, hearing...

564
00:52:59,960 --> 00:53:01,757
Finally sight...

565
00:53:02,640 --> 00:53:05,757
The five gates to pleasure.

566
00:53:19,640 --> 00:53:22,234
Everyone has been assigned
a perfume.

567
00:53:26,920 --> 00:53:28,194
Listen!

568
00:53:29,120 --> 00:53:31,270
They're groaning with pleasure.

569
00:53:32,080 --> 00:53:35,311
Only happy people can build
a harmonious city.

570
00:53:36,000 --> 00:53:37,513
The city of happiness!

571
00:53:58,240 --> 00:54:00,196
Don't waste bread!

572
00:54:00,680 --> 00:54:04,275
Millions of little children
starve for lack of bread.

573
00:54:05,440 --> 00:54:06,111
That's not true.

574
00:54:06,320 --> 00:54:07,116
It is.

575
00:54:08,040 --> 00:54:10,759
If Claudine says so, it's true.

576
00:54:10,960 --> 00:54:11,517
Why?

577
00:54:11,720 --> 00:54:13,676
She's grown up and you're little.

578
00:54:27,920 --> 00:54:30,480
Walter has a one-track mind.

579
00:54:31,760 --> 00:54:34,228
I make love to a guy
who only talks of love

580
00:54:34,440 --> 00:54:36,078
to girls
he doesn't make love to!

581
00:54:36,640 --> 00:54:39,837
I like to be surprised
and you surprise me.

582
00:54:40,040 --> 00:54:42,156
Teaching in that field

583
00:54:42,760 --> 00:54:44,716
hasn't changed since the 1 900's,

584
00:54:45,200 --> 00:54:48,510
and is blatantly outdated now.

585
00:54:48,720 --> 00:54:50,153
Not eating?.

586
00:54:51,960 --> 00:54:53,552
I hate cold food.

587
00:54:53,920 --> 00:54:57,435
I spotted a roadside pizza parlor.

588
00:54:57,760 --> 00:54:59,671
I'm heading there later.

589
00:55:09,280 --> 00:55:10,554
May l?

590
00:55:10,920 --> 00:55:12,069
Go ahead.

591
00:55:19,800 --> 00:55:21,677
You surprise me more and more.

592
00:55:23,000 --> 00:55:24,797
Follow me!

593
00:55:29,440 --> 00:55:31,670
Imagination needs no palace!

594
00:55:31,920 --> 00:55:33,831
It flowers in dungeons.

595
00:55:34,040 --> 00:55:37,237
Look at St. Theresa of Lisieux
or Sade...

596
00:55:37,840 --> 00:55:40,354
What it needs is more spare time.

597
00:55:40,560 --> 00:55:41,993
Time to dream!

598
00:55:44,320 --> 00:55:46,311
They're saying interesting things.

599
00:55:49,640 --> 00:55:51,551
Some things in life are...

600
00:55:51,760 --> 00:55:55,070
far more interesting
than "interesting things".

601
00:55:58,320 --> 00:56:01,995
Imagination is all very well.

602
00:56:02,200 --> 00:56:03,519
Depends on how it's used.

603
00:56:04,000 --> 00:56:07,549
The daydreams of a 3 years old
are of no interest.

604
00:56:07,760 --> 00:56:09,796
Except to a psychoanalyst.

605
00:56:10,240 --> 00:56:13,630
No, the brain's associative powers
must be directed

606
00:56:13,840 --> 00:56:17,799
towards practical ends.
Not to idle dreaming.

607
00:56:18,360 --> 00:56:22,478
Use the imagination.
But to solve real problems!

608
00:56:22,680 --> 00:56:26,753
I'm a teacher: children are sacred!
You scorn them!

609
00:56:26,960 --> 00:56:30,350
Your classroom must turn out
bums and hoodlums!

610
00:56:32,360 --> 00:56:34,590
Cop! You're just a cop!

611
00:57:00,160 --> 00:57:02,196
Here's our chance.

612
00:57:03,200 --> 00:57:04,599
Your chance!

613
00:57:11,160 --> 00:57:14,152
What a pair: you turn out hoodlums,
he reforms them.

614
00:57:14,360 --> 00:57:16,078
Cut it out!

615
00:57:16,400 --> 00:57:18,550
Instead of talking toy,
help Frederic.

616
00:57:18,760 --> 00:57:21,877
They say Miss Rousseau
is brutal with kids.

617
00:59:41,560 --> 00:59:43,278
Why did you do it?.

618
00:59:45,560 --> 00:59:46,709
I don't know, ma'am.

619
00:59:49,280 --> 00:59:50,918
Call me Elizabeth.

620
00:59:51,720 --> 00:59:54,075
I'm your friend. I won't scold you.

621
00:59:58,560 --> 01:00:01,028
Why did you throw that tomato?.

622
01:00:02,120 --> 01:00:03,599
Think hard...

623
01:00:04,840 --> 01:00:06,239
Try and explain...

624
01:00:06,800 --> 01:00:08,631
Because it was fun.

625
01:00:14,440 --> 01:00:15,873
Listen, old man.

626
01:00:16,320 --> 01:00:20,108
Next time ask me for permission, OK?

627
01:00:28,960 --> 01:00:30,188
He's your son?.

628
01:00:32,800 --> 01:00:34,995
I admire your professional reflexes.

629
01:00:35,200 --> 01:00:37,509
You went right after the criminal.

630
01:00:42,920 --> 01:00:45,115
Aren't you ever serious?.

631
01:00:47,680 --> 01:00:48,999
"Serious"?. Meaning what?.

632
01:01:04,160 --> 01:01:07,038
Earlier you said something
that struck me:

633
01:01:08,360 --> 01:01:12,592
that people needed more time.

634
01:01:13,120 --> 01:01:14,758
Time to dream.

635
01:01:15,360 --> 01:01:16,588
I said that?

636
01:01:17,880 --> 01:01:19,791
When you stopped clowning.

637
01:01:20,480 --> 01:01:22,710
You mean when I started clowning...

638
01:01:53,840 --> 01:01:58,356
But aren't all the arts the fruit
of what you call "day-dreams"?

639
01:01:58,560 --> 01:02:01,233
Aren't they as essential to a child

640
01:02:01,440 --> 01:02:03,908
as fresh air?

641
01:02:04,120 --> 01:02:06,793
At isn't as essential
as oppressed minorities!

642
01:02:07,000 --> 01:02:07,955
Or starvation!

643
01:02:08,160 --> 01:02:08,956
That's not it!

644
01:02:09,160 --> 01:02:12,630
- Where do I put the leftover beer?
- In a box. At the side of the road.

645
01:02:16,680 --> 01:02:17,795
It's working.

646
01:02:26,920 --> 01:02:27,909
Come.

647
01:04:10,480 --> 01:04:12,072
It's to spite me!

648
01:04:12,280 --> 01:04:16,193
You know I always hated music.

649
01:04:16,480 --> 01:04:18,789
They'll hear no other sound

650
01:04:19,000 --> 01:04:21,992
but the sweetest of music.

651
01:04:23,240 --> 01:04:24,798
Shut up!

652
01:04:26,560 --> 01:04:31,315
It's your mother!
She's nagging me from the hereafter!

653
01:04:31,520 --> 01:04:33,078
Your mother!

654
01:05:37,800 --> 01:05:39,119
Excellent.

655
01:05:40,680 --> 01:05:45,071
Belgian pizza. At home,
they now serve Italian french fries.

656
01:05:45,760 --> 01:05:46,670
Cultural exchanges.

657
01:05:46,880 --> 01:05:49,553
Cultural imperialism...
Italian-style.

658
01:05:50,040 --> 01:05:52,315
No country is safe from it.

659
01:05:53,960 --> 01:05:55,871
The infectious Gioconda smile.

660
01:05:56,080 --> 01:05:59,277
Hasn't everyone prayed
before a Raphael Madonna?.

661
01:05:59,480 --> 01:06:01,311
Go to the opera? It's in Italian.

662
01:06:01,520 --> 01:06:03,750
The Russian drive Fiat cars.

663
01:06:03,960 --> 01:06:07,953
The whole world eats spaghetti!

664
01:06:09,040 --> 01:06:12,589
Anglo-Saxon cultural imperialism?
It's a joke.

665
01:06:12,800 --> 01:06:14,358
Think about it.

666
01:06:16,080 --> 01:06:20,232
Sinatra, Capone, Minelli, Sacco
and Vanzetti, Coppola. All Italians.

667
01:06:20,440 --> 01:06:21,873
And Shakespeare?

668
01:06:22,400 --> 01:06:25,119
"Othello", "Romeo",
"The merchant of Venice".

669
01:06:25,320 --> 01:06:27,390
All Italian stories.

670
01:06:31,760 --> 01:06:33,239
I love lately.

671
01:06:33,440 --> 01:06:34,793
You understand Italian?

672
01:06:35,000 --> 01:06:35,910
I've read Stendhal...

673
01:06:37,560 --> 01:06:40,632
You don't really trust me.

674
01:06:41,120 --> 01:06:43,793
Yet you came with me.

675
01:06:45,240 --> 01:06:48,437
I love lately...
and I was very hungry.

676
01:06:50,400 --> 01:06:52,277
You want my share?

677
01:06:54,080 --> 01:06:56,548
There's something sad about you.

678
01:06:58,240 --> 01:06:59,116
Why do you say that?

679
01:06:59,320 --> 01:07:00,469
You never stop eating.

680
01:07:03,120 --> 01:07:04,678
Is it anxiety?

681
01:07:07,160 --> 01:07:09,355
Sorry, I'm being silly.

682
01:07:09,560 --> 01:07:11,437
I'm always ravenous.

683
01:07:14,880 --> 01:07:16,154
It's true.

684
01:07:17,800 --> 01:07:20,155
Right now
I've got personal problems.

685
01:07:21,480 --> 01:07:23,710
Maybe I'm aiming too high.

686
01:07:25,440 --> 01:07:26,839
It's ridiculous.

687
01:07:27,040 --> 01:07:30,669
It's crazy: I trust you
and I know I shouldn't.

688
01:07:32,880 --> 01:07:36,031
I've always avoided men like you.

689
01:07:36,240 --> 01:07:39,994
If you think
I'm worthy of your trust...

690
01:07:44,680 --> 01:07:47,592
My mother has a "serious illness".

691
01:07:49,480 --> 01:07:51,436
My father just left her.

692
01:07:54,240 --> 01:07:56,629
I just broke up with my fiancé.

693
01:07:57,400 --> 01:07:58,913
Or rather, he broke it off.

694
01:07:59,600 --> 01:08:00,715
Fiancé?

695
01:08:01,440 --> 01:08:02,953
You were engaged?.

696
01:08:03,480 --> 01:08:06,119
Do people still do that in 1 982?

697
01:08:07,080 --> 01:08:08,832
We were engaged 3 years.

698
01:08:10,520 --> 01:08:13,398
We'd picked an apartment...
bought the furniture.

699
01:08:13,600 --> 01:08:15,272
He dropped me.

700
01:08:19,960 --> 01:08:21,188
I've drunk too much.

701
01:08:22,880 --> 01:08:24,472
It's the wine...

702
01:08:25,080 --> 01:08:26,832
Listen to me.

703
01:08:28,240 --> 01:08:30,390
What if I offered

704
01:08:31,560 --> 01:08:33,630
to marry you... right away.

705
01:08:33,960 --> 01:08:37,509
In 2 weeks we'll leave for lately,
the country you love.

706
01:08:40,440 --> 01:08:42,192
How can you?

707
01:08:44,280 --> 01:08:45,349
I can't believe it.

708
01:08:47,320 --> 01:08:49,356
It's true.

709
01:08:49,960 --> 01:08:52,235
Some things one shouldn't say...

710
01:08:59,200 --> 01:09:00,519
Darling, what a surprise!

711
01:09:01,320 --> 01:09:04,232
I told you:
Walter loves Belgian pizza.

712
01:09:05,000 --> 01:09:08,549
California Bordeaux,
Italian french fries...

713
01:09:08,880 --> 01:09:10,632
And American gothic!

714
01:09:29,760 --> 01:09:30,875
He's dead.

715
01:09:35,600 --> 01:09:38,239
Don't tell me who it was.

716
01:09:41,520 --> 01:09:42,794
Poor child!

717
01:09:45,160 --> 01:09:46,513
Yes, child.

718
01:09:47,520 --> 01:09:49,511
To me he's a stillborn child.

719
01:09:50,200 --> 01:09:53,237
Thousands die like that.

720
01:09:53,920 --> 01:09:56,878
Such accidents
can't stop human progress.

721
01:09:57,440 --> 01:10:01,558
Tell that to the police.

722
01:10:01,840 --> 01:10:04,308
First, happiness for a select few...

723
01:10:04,600 --> 01:10:07,672
Then happiness for all.
Harmony regained!

724
01:10:09,400 --> 01:10:13,154
Harmony: simple to find.

725
01:10:13,600 --> 01:10:16,114
In death!

726
01:10:17,760 --> 01:10:19,990
In love, father.

727
01:10:22,360 --> 01:10:25,830
Open all doors. Bring up the cars!

728
01:10:26,240 --> 01:10:27,798
Free these people!

729
01:10:28,080 --> 01:10:29,593
Don't move.

730
01:10:30,200 --> 01:10:34,159
You're no one here. I'll send you
back to the old age home!

731
01:10:34,640 --> 01:10:36,039
Shut up!

732
01:10:36,240 --> 01:10:37,719
We're carrying on.

733
01:10:39,560 --> 01:10:42,836
I can't stand your silly speeches.

734
01:10:43,040 --> 01:10:45,998
I put up with yours
all through my childhood.

735
01:10:46,640 --> 01:10:49,473
The people you hate,
that you despise...

736
01:10:49,680 --> 01:10:51,955
I love them.

737
01:10:52,160 --> 01:10:53,878
You're for their happiness?

738
01:10:54,080 --> 01:10:58,756
Some of them don't want it!

739
01:10:58,960 --> 01:11:00,598
They drank the potion...

740
01:11:00,800 --> 01:11:05,191
Some didn't: I saw at least one.

741
01:11:05,400 --> 01:11:06,515
Who?.

742
01:11:08,080 --> 01:11:09,752
No matter.

743
01:11:11,640 --> 01:11:13,232
We're carrying on!

744
01:11:54,000 --> 01:11:55,752
We're carrying on.

745
01:12:08,680 --> 01:12:09,749
CONFERENCE HALL

746
01:12:45,600 --> 01:12:47,272
My pupils

747
01:12:47,480 --> 01:12:49,038
in my rural school,

748
01:12:49,240 --> 01:12:52,710
conceived and built this model...
with me.

749
01:12:53,640 --> 01:12:56,632
Every day they added to it.

750
01:12:57,560 --> 01:12:59,551
the boys worked with the girls.

751
01:13:00,080 --> 01:13:01,957
The juniors with the seniors.

752
01:13:03,920 --> 01:13:07,037
I wish they were all here tonight,

753
01:13:07,720 --> 01:13:10,473
so we could explain
what we tried to make,

754
01:13:11,160 --> 01:13:14,596
a tool for learning,
for developing the imagination.

755
01:13:19,240 --> 01:13:22,357
Plain, plateau, hill, mountain,

756
01:13:22,680 --> 01:13:26,434
Lake, glacier, valley, river,

757
01:13:26,640 --> 01:13:30,349
Stream, big river, sea, gulf,

758
01:13:30,560 --> 01:13:34,155
Bay, cape, island,

759
01:13:34,360 --> 01:13:37,397
Archipelago, isthmus, peninsula,

760
01:13:37,600 --> 01:13:40,068
Swamp, desert, forest,

761
01:13:40,280 --> 01:13:42,077
Volcano!

762
01:13:45,480 --> 01:13:49,359
With this object, conceived
and built by the children,

763
01:13:49,760 --> 01:13:51,990
every subject can be taught:

764
01:13:52,280 --> 01:13:56,592
geology, ecology,
history and culture.

765
01:13:58,320 --> 01:14:02,029
Man comes out of the woods,
takes up farming,

766
01:14:02,240 --> 01:14:05,755
tames animals, stocks food...

767
01:14:05,960 --> 01:14:07,837
Builds houses...

768
01:14:08,040 --> 01:14:11,555
To defend his property,
he erects forts,

769
01:14:11,760 --> 01:14:13,557
fights his neighbors...

770
01:14:13,760 --> 01:14:15,478
Explores the ocean...

771
01:14:15,680 --> 01:14:19,229
mines iron and coal...

772
01:14:19,440 --> 01:14:21,112
Factories rise,

773
01:14:21,320 --> 01:14:25,108
and more and more houses

774
01:14:25,320 --> 01:14:28,551
More and more houses

775
01:14:32,760 --> 01:14:37,038
He learns to count:
his sheep, his houses

776
01:14:37,240 --> 01:14:42,109
To weigh his wealth, his grain,
to measure his fields

777
01:14:42,320 --> 01:14:44,038
Mathe-ma-tics!

778
01:14:44,240 --> 01:14:47,994
To name the things
he sees, owns, feels

779
01:14:48,200 --> 01:14:49,872
Lin-guis-tic:

780
01:14:50,080 --> 01:14:54,710
All things have a name,
a number, a meaning

781
01:15:02,680 --> 01:15:06,958
Men, women,
dreams of love and happiness

782
01:15:07,160 --> 01:15:10,596
He loves, builds, learns:

783
01:15:11,360 --> 01:15:16,514
Love, progress, happiness

784
01:15:41,000 --> 01:15:43,195
It's lovely.

785
01:15:43,400 --> 01:15:45,868
Ingenious.

786
01:15:46,080 --> 01:15:47,798
Really good.

787
01:15:52,480 --> 01:15:53,879
A bit too sweeping.

788
01:15:54,080 --> 01:15:58,551
We're so proud of you.

789
01:15:58,760 --> 01:16:01,274
On behalf of all our friends, let me

790
01:16:01,480 --> 01:16:04,677
express our admiration
and gratitude.

791
01:16:06,120 --> 01:16:09,749
It has size, beauty, and enterprise.

792
01:16:10,800 --> 01:16:12,597
Look at the trees,

793
01:16:12,800 --> 01:16:15,030
cows, sheep.

794
01:16:15,240 --> 01:16:18,437
It's lovely.

795
01:16:18,640 --> 01:16:21,632
Admirable. I'm 1 00% for it.

796
01:16:21,920 --> 01:16:25,276
I told Miss Rousseau
how highly I think of her.

797
01:16:25,480 --> 01:16:27,550
But one can take it even further.

798
01:16:27,760 --> 01:16:29,079
You have a new disciple.

799
01:16:29,280 --> 01:16:32,033
Get children involved in the future.

800
01:16:32,560 --> 01:16:36,473
Let them collaborate
on this model of a living city,

801
01:16:36,680 --> 01:16:38,910
gentle and unpredictable as a woman,

802
01:16:39,120 --> 01:16:40,633
flexible as a snake,

803
01:16:40,840 --> 01:16:42,751
scaly and hairy,
the city of our dreams.

804
01:16:42,960 --> 01:16:44,632
True. I fear

805
01:16:44,840 --> 01:16:47,513
she has deviated
from our working premise.

806
01:16:47,720 --> 01:16:49,438
I didn't mean that.

807
01:16:49,960 --> 01:16:50,836
But you said it!

808
01:16:51,040 --> 01:16:52,519
I agree.

809
01:16:52,720 --> 01:16:54,551
All this attention to detail

810
01:16:54,760 --> 01:16:58,469
won't develop a child's imagination,
it will stifle it.

811
01:16:58,680 --> 01:17:02,309
Forever after,
when they say "mountain",

812
01:17:02,520 --> 01:17:05,512
what'll they see?
Miss Rousseau's mountain.

813
01:17:06,520 --> 01:17:09,318
Their imaginations will be blocked.

814
01:17:09,520 --> 01:17:11,476
- I never said that.
- You did.

815
01:17:12,680 --> 01:17:15,353
You're right to criticize...

816
01:17:15,560 --> 01:17:20,031
Miss Rousseau for showing
what is, and not what should be.

817
01:17:20,240 --> 01:17:21,116
Certainly not.

818
01:17:25,320 --> 01:17:29,313
Elizabeth is thrilled
by your interest in her method.

819
01:17:35,520 --> 01:17:39,638
Your method is dangerously
neutral politically.

820
01:17:39,840 --> 01:17:42,354
Not a true view, hence confusing.

821
01:17:42,560 --> 01:17:44,471
Don't give us that!

822
01:17:44,680 --> 01:17:49,151
No, it's a nice toy,
but of no educational value.

823
01:17:49,680 --> 01:17:50,829
- It's a circus act!
- A gag.

824
01:17:51,040 --> 01:17:52,917
It's just a hoax.

825
01:17:53,520 --> 01:17:54,999
Don't distort my point.

826
01:18:02,680 --> 01:18:05,194
Friends.

827
01:18:05,400 --> 01:18:07,994
There's truth in what you say.

828
01:18:08,200 --> 01:18:11,909
But let's think straight.

829
01:18:12,120 --> 01:18:14,588
Who are we trying to reach?.
Children.

830
01:18:14,800 --> 01:18:17,712
What is a child? The son of man...

831
01:18:17,920 --> 01:18:19,194
What is man?.

832
01:18:19,400 --> 01:18:20,355
Good question.

833
01:18:20,560 --> 01:18:24,235
Is he good? Is he evil?

834
01:18:24,440 --> 01:18:24,997
Dumb question.

835
01:18:25,200 --> 01:18:28,715
We're miles off course!

836
01:18:32,040 --> 01:18:34,474
We must start from scratch!

837
01:18:34,680 --> 01:18:35,999
You said it!

838
01:18:36,200 --> 01:18:38,395
I'll say it again.

839
01:18:40,840 --> 01:18:42,273
Let's go to bed.

840
01:18:42,560 --> 01:18:45,154
Man, or what we call man...

841
01:18:45,360 --> 01:18:49,353
Civilized man,
is the exploiter exploited!

842
01:18:49,560 --> 01:18:52,472
Abolish exploitation,
and you abolish man!

843
01:18:52,680 --> 01:18:55,433
Man, child, they're all bastards.

844
01:18:55,640 --> 01:19:00,475
I'm a bastard, you're a bastard,
he's a bastard.

845
01:19:01,120 --> 01:19:06,148
You enjoy calling us bastards!

846
01:19:06,760 --> 01:19:09,149
Yes, because I'm a bastard.

847
01:19:21,800 --> 01:19:24,712
I'm leaving... I'm off.

848
01:19:30,360 --> 01:19:32,112
Don't leave, friends.

849
01:19:32,640 --> 01:19:34,631
You won't give democratic debate
a chance.

850
01:19:34,840 --> 01:19:36,319
Friends.

851
01:19:37,600 --> 01:19:39,750
I'm going away.

852
01:19:40,240 --> 01:19:43,755
No, count me out.

853
01:19:48,400 --> 01:19:51,278
I've had enough.

854
01:19:56,080 --> 01:19:57,399
Friends.

855
01:20:19,440 --> 01:20:23,353
You're just a pain.
You're out of skulls.

856
01:20:27,000 --> 01:20:28,319
Friends!

857
01:20:31,120 --> 01:20:33,953
Asshole!. Old fart! Turdface!

858
01:20:34,160 --> 01:20:35,513
Shit!.

859
01:20:39,120 --> 01:20:41,509
I'm too old!

860
01:20:42,040 --> 01:20:44,873
I can't stand shouting!

861
01:20:45,080 --> 01:20:46,991
Bastard!

862
01:21:02,840 --> 01:21:05,832
We're taking off, too. Yes, we are!

863
01:21:06,040 --> 01:21:09,669
No, don't leave! Wait!

864
01:21:09,920 --> 01:21:13,435
We can't settle
for surface unanimity!

865
01:21:14,360 --> 01:21:17,432
It takes more than that.

866
01:21:55,360 --> 01:21:56,998
It's a tragedy.

867
01:22:00,120 --> 01:22:01,758
Courage! We're with you.

868
01:22:01,960 --> 01:22:04,315
Enough claptrap, priest!
We need action.

869
01:22:04,520 --> 01:22:07,273
We must find the evil, excise it.

870
01:22:07,480 --> 01:22:08,799
Yes, cut to the heart.

871
01:22:09,000 --> 01:22:10,319
You shut up there.

872
01:22:10,520 --> 01:22:14,035
Your libertarian drivel
may be to blame, Bertin.

873
01:22:14,400 --> 01:22:16,436
Or yours, Guarini.

874
01:22:16,640 --> 01:22:18,471
Why did I invite a Utopian?

875
01:22:20,480 --> 01:22:24,519
Heraclitus called human thought
child's play.

876
01:22:28,360 --> 01:22:29,509
I'll keep you informed.

877
01:22:29,720 --> 01:22:31,438
Sure. Ciao.

878
01:22:32,240 --> 01:22:33,798
Let's try to make sense.

879
01:22:35,160 --> 01:22:36,229
You're right.

880
01:22:36,440 --> 01:22:39,955
Dissonance has replaced harmony.

881
01:22:40,160 --> 01:22:42,549
Shouldn't have let
a scientific meeting

882
01:22:42,760 --> 01:22:45,797
degenerate
into a handicrafts session.

883
01:22:46,000 --> 01:22:48,116
That's right, Miss Rousseau!

884
01:22:58,600 --> 01:22:59,794
Turn all that off.

885
01:23:02,360 --> 01:23:04,715
You must have something to tell us.

886
01:23:14,680 --> 01:23:15,829
Don't leave, please.

887
01:23:19,440 --> 01:23:20,998
- You're silent.
- Exasperating!

888
01:23:21,200 --> 01:23:22,030
Talk, damn it!

889
01:23:22,240 --> 01:23:23,309
How do you see it?

890
01:23:23,520 --> 01:23:24,589
Speak fearlessly.

891
01:23:24,800 --> 01:23:26,279
Speak, then.

892
01:23:29,560 --> 01:23:31,516
I gather I'm under arrest.

893
01:23:31,880 --> 01:23:34,348
Did I hear correctly? "Arrest"?.

894
01:23:34,800 --> 01:23:37,234
Are you calling us cops?

895
01:23:37,440 --> 01:23:41,991
Friends, he says educators are cops.

896
01:23:43,360 --> 01:23:46,158
You're to give your talk tomorrow.

897
01:23:46,440 --> 01:23:50,592
I'll thank you
to let me see it first.

898
01:23:52,720 --> 01:23:54,676
I planned to improvise.

899
01:23:55,520 --> 01:23:57,351
That's provocation.

900
01:23:58,160 --> 01:24:01,277
Robert, I order you to stay.

901
01:24:04,360 --> 01:24:06,555
He excluded himself.

902
01:24:07,080 --> 01:24:09,594
Now what do we do?.

903
01:24:10,160 --> 01:24:11,798
We carry on.

904
01:24:39,600 --> 01:24:44,037
He's dreamed of this conference
for months. Right, Claudine.

905
01:24:44,240 --> 01:24:46,708
I don't know. Maybe.

906
01:24:46,920 --> 01:24:48,478
It's true.

907
01:24:49,480 --> 01:24:52,313
What he did for you was unheard-of.

908
01:24:52,800 --> 01:24:53,630
What'd he do?

909
01:24:53,840 --> 01:24:54,955
He didn't say a word.

910
01:24:55,160 --> 01:24:57,515
Be quiet! You don't know anything.

911
01:24:57,760 --> 01:24:59,637
You didn't watch him.

912
01:25:00,560 --> 01:25:04,348
That mute admiration

913
01:25:05,160 --> 01:25:08,197
for your work,
that he bravely showed,

914
01:25:08,840 --> 01:25:12,799
that's what turned
the others against him.

915
01:25:13,840 --> 01:25:15,319
Think so?

916
01:25:17,680 --> 01:25:19,671
You should go and thank him.

917
01:25:20,400 --> 01:25:21,753
Saboteur!

918
01:25:30,520 --> 01:25:32,192
I came to thank you.

919
01:25:34,040 --> 01:25:37,669
And to apologize. It's all my fault.

920
01:25:39,160 --> 01:25:40,912
Thank me?

921
01:25:41,560 --> 01:25:43,437
I don't understand.

922
01:25:44,840 --> 01:25:46,273
Come on in.

923
01:25:58,080 --> 01:26:01,595
Your support for me
got you into trouble.

924
01:26:03,120 --> 01:26:05,680
It's I who should apologize.

925
01:26:06,040 --> 01:26:09,350
I shouldn't have let them
open their mouths.

926
01:26:09,560 --> 01:26:11,437
No, you were fine.

927
01:26:13,600 --> 01:26:15,716
They were right to criticize me.

928
01:26:16,880 --> 01:26:20,668
I'm not sure
I'm cut out for this work.

929
01:26:23,240 --> 01:26:24,593
No.

930
01:26:24,960 --> 01:26:26,359
I'm the one

931
01:26:27,240 --> 01:26:28,958
who can't do it.

932
01:26:31,240 --> 01:26:33,276
What am I supposed to teach kids?

933
01:26:35,520 --> 01:26:38,876
When you're small,
you have to believe what adults say.

934
01:26:39,920 --> 01:26:41,956
Maybe it's not all useless.

935
01:26:43,680 --> 01:26:45,591
But this need to believe

936
01:26:47,600 --> 01:26:50,876
is like a drug. You get hooked.

937
01:26:53,320 --> 01:26:55,515
Then when you grow up,

938
01:26:56,800 --> 01:27:00,873
you cling to beliefs
that the facts contradict.

939
01:27:01,880 --> 01:27:03,438
So what should I teach
my students?.

940
01:27:07,240 --> 01:27:09,276
To disbelieve what I teach them?

941
01:27:09,520 --> 01:27:11,556
Then they won't study.

942
01:27:14,800 --> 01:27:16,756
Now I'm getting serious.

943
01:27:19,840 --> 01:27:21,751
I have no calling.

944
01:27:28,040 --> 01:27:29,792
Your son is very nice.

945
01:27:37,000 --> 01:27:37,750
You married?.

946
01:27:38,840 --> 01:27:40,432
I was. Twice.

947
01:27:41,320 --> 01:27:42,150
That's enough.

948
01:28:29,920 --> 01:28:32,514
I shouldn't be here this late.

949
01:28:32,920 --> 01:28:35,115
But it's about a serious matter.

950
01:28:35,920 --> 01:28:38,229
I heard of your pranks!

951
01:28:38,560 --> 01:28:41,996
Mr. Leroux told me
of your outrageous behavior.

952
01:28:42,200 --> 01:28:44,794
The parents of our students
are bound to find out.

953
01:28:45,000 --> 01:28:48,231
So to head off the storm,

954
01:28:48,640 --> 01:28:51,200
I'll have to let you go.

955
01:28:51,400 --> 01:28:52,992
I deeply regret it.

956
01:28:53,200 --> 01:28:57,239
You're young, in love...
Love can make us lose our heads.

957
01:28:57,440 --> 01:28:58,589
But there are limits!

958
01:28:58,800 --> 01:29:01,075
To make a fool of oneself
over a map.

959
01:29:02,720 --> 01:29:04,915
Just as well.
I've decided to quit teaching.

960
01:29:08,320 --> 01:29:10,356
I want to make people laugh.

961
01:29:11,200 --> 01:29:13,475
Anything: juggle, clown...

962
01:29:14,640 --> 01:29:16,312
Comic...

963
01:29:33,840 --> 01:29:35,592
Don't leave us.

964
01:29:35,920 --> 01:29:37,399
Stay here.

965
01:29:37,960 --> 01:29:39,518
I beg you.

966
01:29:39,760 --> 01:29:42,593
Do anything you want...
But don't leave.

967
01:29:42,960 --> 01:29:44,154
Stay.

968
01:29:44,720 --> 01:29:46,438
Don't abandon us.

969
01:29:47,720 --> 01:29:49,153
We need you.

970
01:29:50,600 --> 01:29:52,830
We do... I'm so ashamed.

971
01:30:11,120 --> 01:30:14,510
Love! Love!

972
01:30:14,720 --> 01:30:18,269
Happiness! Happiness!

973
01:31:24,000 --> 01:31:25,274
Come in.

974
01:31:29,520 --> 01:31:30,714
At last!

975
01:31:32,680 --> 01:31:34,238
You've made up your mind.

976
01:31:38,000 --> 01:31:40,594
Love!

977
01:31:45,480 --> 01:31:48,472
Happiness! Love!

978
01:33:11,080 --> 01:33:12,308
Raoul!

979
01:33:17,520 --> 01:33:19,078
Where is Raoul/

980
01:33:21,840 --> 01:33:22,716
Who is Raoul?.

981
01:33:23,040 --> 01:33:25,679
Your friend... mine.

982
01:33:26,440 --> 01:33:27,395
I want to see him.

983
01:33:28,720 --> 01:33:30,358
He no longer exists.

984
01:33:33,480 --> 01:33:36,233
Those you knew are changed.

985
01:33:37,400 --> 01:33:40,631
They're brand new.

986
01:33:42,480 --> 01:33:44,391
You couldn't recognize them.

987
01:33:46,440 --> 01:33:47,395
I want to see him.

988
01:33:53,160 --> 01:33:54,479
Come!

989
01:34:49,920 --> 01:34:51,194
Raoul, my friend.

990
01:34:53,400 --> 01:34:56,551
So you won't taste the happiness
I offered you.

991
01:34:57,200 --> 01:34:58,474
What happiness?.

992
01:34:59,800 --> 01:35:02,394
You think he wanted your happiness?.

993
01:35:04,280 --> 01:35:05,315
He was happy.

994
01:35:05,520 --> 01:35:08,432
When you were happy,
did you think of me?

995
01:35:08,640 --> 01:35:10,756
Of me, your unhappy friend?.

996
01:35:11,160 --> 01:35:14,357
Happiness isn't built
on others misery.

997
01:35:14,600 --> 01:35:16,318
My happiness is seeing
everyone happy.

998
01:35:16,520 --> 01:35:17,953
I don't want everyone's happiness.

999
01:35:19,520 --> 01:35:21,715
Then why did you stay?.

1000
01:35:22,400 --> 01:35:24,118
It was because you were unhappy.

1001
01:35:25,080 --> 01:35:26,354
I don't want to be happy.

1002
01:35:26,560 --> 01:35:29,518
You stayed because
your marriage was a lie.

1003
01:35:31,440 --> 01:35:32,236
I loved him.

1004
01:35:33,120 --> 01:35:34,394
You married him.

1005
01:35:34,600 --> 01:35:37,910
He was leaving for the war,
perhaps never to return.

1006
01:35:38,120 --> 01:35:41,749
Maybe you hoped he wouldn't return,
but he did.

1007
01:35:42,880 --> 01:35:45,599
It's true. I no longer loved him.

1008
01:35:46,560 --> 01:35:49,393
I gave you both a chance,

1009
01:35:49,640 --> 01:35:51,471
but you had to play the game
without cheating.

1010
01:35:51,680 --> 01:35:53,238
I want to love.

1011
01:35:53,480 --> 01:35:56,358
I want fire, I want ice.

1012
01:35:56,800 --> 01:35:59,314
I refuse the tepid sweetness
you would plunge us into.

1013
01:36:00,040 --> 01:36:03,715
You won't understand:
happiness is a burning flash,

1014
01:36:04,240 --> 01:36:06,117
that obliterates us.

1015
01:36:07,120 --> 01:36:09,156
You're just a child, Michel.

1016
01:36:10,720 --> 01:36:12,950
You hasn't the right to stay,

1017
01:36:14,160 --> 01:36:15,070
you spied on me,

1018
01:36:15,560 --> 01:36:17,152
to ruin my work. You killed Raoul.

1019
01:36:17,760 --> 01:36:19,079
It's your fault!

1020
01:36:19,600 --> 01:36:21,397
You're my worst enemy.

1021
01:36:22,800 --> 01:36:23,357
It's you.

1022
01:36:24,720 --> 01:36:26,119
You killed him.

1023
01:36:26,320 --> 01:36:27,639
Don't touch me.

1024
01:36:57,360 --> 01:36:58,793
Have pity!

1025
01:37:05,160 --> 01:37:07,276
Happiness!

1026
01:37:09,080 --> 01:37:12,675
Liberty...

1027
01:37:23,680 --> 01:37:27,275
Happiness... Love...

1028
01:37:33,640 --> 01:37:35,039
Wake up.

1029
01:37:56,760 --> 01:37:57,988
Livia!

1030
01:38:00,240 --> 01:38:01,514
Love!

1031
01:38:10,200 --> 01:38:11,553
Wake up!

1032
01:38:26,120 --> 01:38:28,076
Don't stand there, kids.

1033
01:38:39,480 --> 01:38:40,674
Morning.

1034
01:38:42,320 --> 01:38:43,673
Morning, ma'am.

1035
01:38:47,040 --> 01:38:50,271
We must stay together, my friends.

1036
01:38:50,480 --> 01:38:53,836
We must preserve our unity.

1037
01:38:54,040 --> 01:38:55,155
Primary task.

1038
01:38:55,360 --> 01:38:58,238
We'll see each other,
write letters... Unity,

1039
01:38:58,440 --> 01:39:00,795
that's the first priority.

1040
01:39:01,440 --> 01:39:03,715
- It's all clear now.
- No more compromising!

1041
01:39:03,920 --> 01:39:06,639
- We must start over.
- Sorry about last night.

1042
01:39:11,040 --> 01:39:13,315
Sure! Prophet of evil!

1043
01:39:13,520 --> 01:39:14,589
A temporary hitch.

1044
01:39:14,800 --> 01:39:16,199
I was a little nervous.

1045
01:39:16,400 --> 01:39:18,516
A new start, on new bases.

1046
01:39:21,160 --> 01:39:22,479
What for?.

1047
01:39:23,320 --> 01:39:25,072
Have you seen Elizabeth?

1048
01:39:26,040 --> 01:39:27,598
Not since last night.

1049
01:39:31,000 --> 01:39:32,149
Are you leaving?

1050
01:39:32,520 --> 01:39:34,397
I'm quitting the Holberg School.

1051
01:39:34,600 --> 01:39:35,828
And Eliza...

1052
01:39:36,960 --> 01:39:38,598
I mean, Frederic.

1053
01:39:39,360 --> 01:39:42,989
He's going with me. With us.

1054
01:39:44,040 --> 01:39:47,669
Mrs. Winkle, how's Guarini?

1055
01:39:47,880 --> 01:39:49,598
I'm waiting for him now.

1056
01:39:54,920 --> 01:39:56,512
Miss Obertin,

1057
01:39:56,720 --> 01:40:01,077
where's nostro excellentissimo
maestro Guarini?.

1058
01:40:02,400 --> 01:40:03,958
Nora should know.

1059
01:40:04,360 --> 01:40:05,509
There he is now.

1060
01:40:15,440 --> 01:40:18,716
There's no more dust, no dirt

1061
01:40:19,480 --> 01:40:22,597
No hunchbacks, no cripples

1062
01:40:23,120 --> 01:40:26,317
No one's hungry any more, or cold

1063
01:40:27,000 --> 01:40:30,276
No one's teeth or stomach ache

1064
01:40:30,720 --> 01:40:34,269
The ground is smooth
and soft to the step

1065
01:40:34,640 --> 01:40:38,315
All hearts overflow
with love and friendship

1066
01:40:38,520 --> 01:40:42,274
The age of happiness is beginning

1067
01:40:47,160 --> 01:40:49,799
Love

1068
01:40:50,000 --> 01:40:53,549
Happiness, love

1069
01:41:26,240 --> 01:41:28,276
Oy, oy, oy, my bet!

1070
01:41:30,000 --> 01:41:31,592
I think I've lost it.

1071
01:41:31,960 --> 01:41:33,712
Twice over, in fact.

1072
01:41:33,920 --> 01:41:36,195
If you lost, then I won.

1073
01:41:40,760 --> 01:41:42,239
Thinking?

1074
01:41:43,040 --> 01:41:45,395
I think Napoleon was right:

1075
01:41:48,280 --> 01:41:49,838
Life is a fairy tale.

1076
01:41:51,440 --> 01:41:52,873
Kiss me.

1077
01:42:11,720 --> 01:42:13,756
I don't know
what you've lost, but

1078
01:42:14,800 --> 01:42:16,153
I've the same feeling.

1079
01:42:16,360 --> 01:42:18,271
Mind your manners.

1080
01:42:18,480 --> 01:42:19,754
What can we do:

1081
01:42:19,960 --> 01:42:23,919
as my father said,
life isn't a fairy tale.

1082
01:42:38,200 --> 01:42:40,395
Miss Obertin, the children!

1083
01:43:06,800 --> 01:43:10,759
Distant people, pay attention

1084
01:43:11,080 --> 01:43:13,150
Attention

1085
01:43:13,360 --> 01:43:16,591
Pay attention, please

1086
01:43:16,880 --> 01:43:20,873
This is the day, this is the hour

1087
01:43:21,160 --> 01:43:24,709
This is the minute. This is the end

1088
01:43:24,920 --> 01:43:26,831
This is the beginning

1089
01:43:27,040 --> 01:43:31,352
Unroll the carpets,
tar over the cobblestones

1090
01:43:31,560 --> 01:43:35,155
It's here, it's come

1091
01:43:35,360 --> 01:43:38,955
It's love

1092
01:43:39,280 --> 01:43:43,034
Love's reign has begun

1093
01:43:56,520 --> 01:43:59,796
So she told dad,
"Life isn't a fairy tale."

1094
01:44:00,160 --> 01:44:01,832
Life isn't a fairy tale?

1095
01:44:02,040 --> 01:44:03,109
What did she mean?

1096
01:44:03,320 --> 01:44:05,231
We'll know when we grow up.

1097
01:44:05,440 --> 01:44:06,634
When will I be grown?

1098
01:44:07,000 --> 01:44:07,989
When you're my age.

1099
01:44:08,200 --> 01:44:12,273
When you're my age.

1100
01:44:12,520 --> 01:44:17,150
Then why don't you understand?

1101
01:44:17,360 --> 01:44:21,512
Because she isn't old enough.

1102
01:44:21,720 --> 01:44:24,518
Are you old enough?

1103
01:44:24,720 --> 01:44:28,076
No, since he doesn't understand.

1104
01:44:28,280 --> 01:44:31,795
Is daddy old enough?

1105
01:44:32,000 --> 01:44:36,118
No, since he didn't understand.
