1
00:03:16,896 --> 00:03:19,057
Great! What a man!

2
00:03:19,299 --> 00:03:23,360
He is not a man, he is a whirlwind

3
00:03:25,138 --> 00:03:29,006
Come fast, very, very fast

4
00:03:29,242 --> 00:03:30,573
Mr. Raja, who is this boy?

5
00:03:30,843 --> 00:03:33,676
He is our most faithful dog

6
00:03:34,080 --> 00:03:44,422
If I measure the faithfulness
of all my dogs, he will win

7
00:03:48,461 --> 00:03:50,224
Well done!

8
00:03:54,334 --> 00:03:59,601
Well done, Shankar, you are great

9
00:03:59,839 --> 00:04:05,141
Of course. He has a lion's heart

10
00:04:06,079 --> 00:04:07,979
Who put it in his chest?

11
00:04:08,248 --> 00:04:10,716
Who made him a man of steel?

12
00:04:10,984 --> 00:04:14,351
Bloody fool! It's Raja Saheb!

13
00:04:15,388 --> 00:04:19,791
Raja Saheb, Raja Saheb,
disaster has struck!

14
00:04:20,059 --> 00:04:22,823
The men have stopped working
in the coal mines

15
00:04:23,062 --> 00:04:26,554
Why? Is there a fire in the mines?

16
00:04:26,799 --> 00:04:28,892
The fire is in your brother's mind

17
00:04:29,135 --> 00:04:29,658
He is beating up one of the men
very badly

18
00:04:32,705 --> 00:04:35,139
Please don't beat my father

19
00:04:35,375 --> 00:04:39,334
Please let him go. He will die.

20
00:04:41,281 --> 00:04:43,943
Please don't beat my father

21
00:04:44,217 --> 00:04:45,548
Halt!

22
00:04:45,952 --> 00:04:48,853
What is this, Birjwa?

23
00:04:49,255 --> 00:04:52,918
Brother, she was going by...

24
00:04:53,159 --> 00:04:56,856
I fancied her, so I grabbed her hand
That's all.

25
00:04:59,932 --> 00:05:03,561
Oh, Raja Saheb, why are you being
so harsh with your brother?

26
00:05:03,803 --> 00:05:06,271
He has always been like this,
right from childhood.

27
00:05:06,506 --> 00:05:07,530
You shut up!

28
00:05:07,907 --> 00:05:14,676
Listen carefully, Birjwa, the daughters
of these men are like our own

29
00:05:15,214 --> 00:05:17,910
I am the King and these are my subjects

30
00:05:18,418 --> 00:05:24,050
There's a God above
but I am their God on earth

31
00:05:24,290 --> 00:05:27,418
Go away, Bloody fool!

32
00:05:31,397 --> 00:05:38,098
Great! I have witnessed the
justice of the Court of Jehangir

33
00:05:38,471 --> 00:05:41,031
Slapped by his own brother

34
00:05:41,474 --> 00:05:46,207
When Birjwa was slapped,
it was my heart that bled

35
00:05:46,479 --> 00:05:48,470
Yeah, if you think I lie...

36
00:05:48,748 --> 00:05:52,309
... then may the village mad dog bite er,
er, anyone!

37
00:05:52,618 --> 00:05:56,520
I am doing plain talking

38
00:05:57,323 --> 00:06:00,588
Hail the great Raja Saheb!

39
00:06:01,961 --> 00:06:05,453
Ladies and gentlemen, I am Mr. Tol Mol

40
00:06:05,698 --> 00:06:09,566
I talk in riddles,
but lay bare deep secrets

41
00:06:10,169 --> 00:06:12,433
What the hell are you talking about?

42
00:06:12,739 --> 00:06:15,139
I am recounting the history
of this village

43
00:06:15,375 --> 00:06:17,639
For ages men have been bying women here

44
00:06:17,910 --> 00:06:20,174
See that old man? See where he is going

45
00:06:20,813 --> 00:06:24,715
He is giving medicine to all the old men
to turn them young

46
00:06:25,051 --> 00:06:26,382
What a rascal!

47
00:06:28,388 --> 00:06:29,946
What's that he is saying?

48
00:06:30,256 --> 00:06:32,349
Father, he is telling us your real name

49
00:06:32,625 --> 00:06:34,490
You are a fool, and
I am the son of a fool

50
00:06:34,927 --> 00:06:38,556
Why the hell are you wasting your life
fooling around whit that puppet?

51
00:06:38,798 --> 00:06:43,633
Look how I am pursuing
our ancestral trade

52
00:06:44,003 --> 00:06:46,767
You are cheating the rich people

53
00:06:47,006 --> 00:06:49,839
Please try to make my husband
more virile

54
00:06:50,076 --> 00:06:51,475
Increase his virility?

55
00:06:51,744 --> 00:06:55,043
It means that the pill you gave him
last time had no effect

56
00:06:55,281 --> 00:06:57,181
Yes, that is true

57
00:06:59,519 --> 00:07:03,387
But this time I will give you
such a medicine that

58
00:07:03,956 --> 00:07:06,686
Father, why are you ruining their lives?

59
00:07:06,926 --> 00:07:09,588
No, no. I am re-kindling his fire

60
00:07:09,829 --> 00:07:12,923
What you are trying to do is
to set alight wood that is damp

61
00:07:13,166 --> 00:07:15,532
You'll get nothing but smoke

62
00:07:15,768 --> 00:07:16,826
Why?

63
00:07:17,136 --> 00:07:21,505
Because, Father, you are trying to
play a guitar that has no strings

64
00:07:21,741 --> 00:07:23,333
Are his strings broken?

65
00:07:23,576 --> 00:07:26,739
The whole instrument is broken, Father

66
00:07:27,013 --> 00:07:29,641
And this model will not work
Am I right, sister?

67
00:07:29,882 --> 00:07:31,611
Yes, you are right
I have been taken for a ride

68
00:07:31,918 --> 00:07:34,182
Hey, have you had any refreshments,
or are you just talking away?

69
00:07:34,454 --> 00:07:36,945
I will see to his eating,
you look after his drinking

70
00:07:37,256 --> 00:07:38,689
Shankar

71
00:07:40,026 --> 00:07:42,551
Give me the tray

72
00:07:46,299 --> 00:07:49,598
Friends, the Court is ready
but where is the King?

73
00:07:52,238 --> 00:07:54,763
Master, what is this?

74
00:07:55,107 --> 00:08:00,101
You were the cause of
my beating my own brother

75
00:08:00,847 --> 00:08:05,807
I will now give you the same thrashing

76
00:08:06,486 --> 00:08:10,354
But, Master, your brother
teases our daughters...

77
00:08:10,590 --> 00:08:13,491
Shut up, son of a bitch

78
00:08:14,794 --> 00:08:21,723
Your children become our slaves
the moment they are conceived

79
00:08:22,435 --> 00:08:25,427
We can do what we like with them

80
00:08:25,671 --> 00:08:28,868
Your wives and daughters...

81
00:08:29,876 --> 00:08:32,538
... we can use them any way we like

82
00:08:32,812 --> 00:08:35,280
They are our property

83
00:08:35,548 --> 00:08:41,418
We will raise our voice against this,
yes we will

84
00:09:07,179 --> 00:09:10,171
Throw him to the dogs

85
00:09:33,372 --> 00:09:37,172
What are you doing here?
What did you see?

86
00:09:37,710 --> 00:09:39,302
You didn't see anything!

87
00:09:44,650 --> 00:09:48,017
Tell me, what did you see?

88
00:09:51,357 --> 00:09:54,224
What, what did you see?

89
00:10:06,305 --> 00:10:08,068
What did you see, eh?

90
00:10:13,312 --> 00:10:17,248
Birjwa. What is it?

91
00:10:19,251 --> 00:10:22,482
He has seen something, but won't say

92
00:10:22,855 --> 00:10:25,688
Hey, does coal ever talk?

93
00:10:26,158 --> 00:10:28,592
Does the mountain talk?

94
00:10:29,295 --> 00:10:32,093
You need a voice to be able to talk

95
00:10:32,331 --> 00:10:37,428
Where will this dink get a voice from,
he is dumb

96
00:10:37,670 --> 00:10:41,333
I know that, but he has seen something

97
00:10:41,574 --> 00:10:43,337
You may ask him!

98
00:10:43,709 --> 00:10:45,643
Shankar

99
00:10:57,623 --> 00:11:01,059
Birjwa, I may be illiterate

100
00:11:01,360 --> 00:11:05,057
but I have been reading this mute
from his childhood

101
00:11:05,297 --> 00:11:08,630
I can tell, he has not seen anything

102
00:11:09,301 --> 00:11:12,361
Go, Shankar, go!

103
00:11:47,540 --> 00:11:51,374
Good party, wonderful party,
wonderful party

104
00:11:51,644 --> 00:11:53,635
You have had to much to drink

105
00:11:53,913 --> 00:11:57,781
I have drunk a lot of wine

106
00:11:58,451 --> 00:12:00,817
but now I must drink from
the fountain of your youth

107
00:12:01,120 --> 00:12:03,918
You always say this when you're drunk

108
00:12:04,857 --> 00:12:11,353
Bindiya darling, the Creator made you
so beautiful

109
00:12:11,897 --> 00:12:16,493
Why then do you cover your
beautiful body?

110
00:12:16,736 --> 00:12:19,728
Throw away your clothes

111
00:12:20,339 --> 00:12:22,899
I will appreciate your beauty

112
00:12:25,244 --> 00:12:29,544
One would think this was the
first time you were seeing it

113
00:12:31,684 --> 00:12:35,814
That's it! The miracle of God

114
00:13:23,202 --> 00:13:26,137
Oh, damn you, Guard

115
00:13:26,572 --> 00:13:31,373
I am right in the middle of the road
and you are shooting bullets at me

116
00:13:31,710 --> 00:13:33,905
Raja Saheb has given us orders to shoot

117
00:13:34,180 --> 00:13:37,946
Raja Saheb cannto live without the
pellets that I give him,

118
00:13:38,217 --> 00:13:41,152
but your bullets,
were they to hit me by any chance

119
00:13:41,453 --> 00:13:43,785
then you've had it
Even if you escape Raja,

120
00:13:44,023 --> 00:13:46,355
Birjwa will definitely kill you.

121
00:13:50,596 --> 00:13:52,587
What are you doing?

122
00:13:52,832 --> 00:13:54,663
What are you doing?

123
00:14:01,507 --> 00:14:04,374
Raja Saheb, Raja Saheb, Raja Saheb,

124
00:14:05,544 --> 00:14:06,943
Why are you shouting?

125
00:14:07,213 --> 00:14:08,544
You have no enemies,

126
00:14:08,781 --> 00:14:13,047
then why all these guards and
bullets and dogs?

127
00:14:13,752 --> 00:14:20,419
Listen, grass and enmity can grow
anywhere and at any time

128
00:14:21,393 --> 00:14:23,418
After all I am the King

129
00:14:23,662 --> 00:14:27,029
so I must have some target

130
00:14:27,600 --> 00:14:29,932
The Deputy Inspector is on the line

131
00:14:30,569 --> 00:14:32,503
Yes, Inspector, what is it?

132
00:14:32,738 --> 00:14:33,864
You are coming, aren't you?

133
00:14:34,106 --> 00:14:37,234
I will certainly be there
for your daughter's wedding

134
00:14:37,476 --> 00:14:38,704
Don't worry

135
00:14:38,978 --> 00:14:40,912
Wunnerful, my friend, wunnerfool!

136
00:14:41,180 --> 00:14:44,047
It's wonderful, not wunnerfool

137
00:14:45,084 --> 00:14:48,019
Yeah, that's what I said, didn't I!

138
00:14:52,725 --> 00:14:54,283
What is the matter, Raja Saheb?

139
00:14:54,526 --> 00:14:56,994
You seem to have lost out to her today?

140
00:14:57,229 --> 00:15:00,027
It is all your fault

141
00:15:00,466 --> 00:15:04,869
You gave me such medicine that
I failed once again last night

142
00:15:05,104 --> 00:15:07,629
Once again I was humiliated

143
00:15:07,873 --> 00:15:10,535
It is not the fault of the medicine

144
00:15:10,776 --> 00:15:13,176
Whose fault is it then?
It is the fault of the model

145
00:15:13,445 --> 00:15:16,346
At this age where can I find
a better model?

146
00:15:16,882 --> 00:15:18,645
Just open your eyes and look around

147
00:15:18,951 --> 00:15:21,818
God has made many beautiful models

148
00:15:48,647 --> 00:15:50,672
Listen, Gauri, I was...!

149
00:15:52,685 --> 00:15:57,088
Hey, Gauri, what have you people done!

150
00:15:57,756 --> 00:16:00,520
Eaten sweets, that's what

151
00:16:01,093 --> 00:16:03,459
Those were laced with cannabis!

152
00:16:03,762 --> 00:16:05,787
There will be a heap of trouble

153
00:16:06,031 --> 00:16:10,127
Is that so? What a disaster!

154
00:16:11,503 --> 00:16:15,064
You will not be able to look straight

155
00:16:15,307 --> 00:16:18,071
That is what is happening

156
00:16:18,444 --> 00:16:19,741
You will become intoxicated

157
00:16:19,979 --> 00:16:22,709
We have become intoxicated!

158
00:16:37,663 --> 00:16:39,324
Stop!

159
00:18:03,649 --> 00:18:05,446
Water!
Look what is happening!

160
00:18:05,751 --> 00:18:07,776
Milk is flowing from the tap!

161
00:21:18,644 --> 00:21:20,874
Whoa! Stop the Jeep!

162
00:21:25,684 --> 00:21:28,676
Hey, what are you waving your hands for?
Blow the horn

163
00:21:29,721 --> 00:21:32,554
Hey, you there, you girl

164
00:21:34,993 --> 00:21:39,453
Not "you there", but Gauri,
that is my name

165
00:21:39,698 --> 00:21:43,134
Gauri, the beloved of the moon

166
00:21:44,503 --> 00:21:48,337
Gauri, Gauri, the beloved of the moon!

167
00:21:48,573 --> 00:21:52,236
Hey you, move aside

168
00:21:52,511 --> 00:21:53,842
Why, what for?

169
00:21:54,079 --> 00:21:56,104
Because you are sitting in the
middle of the road, that's why

170
00:21:56,381 --> 00:22:00,374
We are not sitting on the road,
the road has spread itself under us

171
00:22:00,619 --> 00:22:02,450
This girl looks mad to me

172
00:22:02,688 --> 00:22:06,215
What did you say? You called Gauri
mad? You called me mad?

173
00:22:06,525 --> 00:22:08,891
Just say that once again, say it,
I dare you

174
00:22:09,127 --> 00:22:10,560
You curved moustached man

175
00:22:11,163 --> 00:22:12,653
Moustached!

176
00:22:15,334 --> 00:22:19,100
What are you staring at me for, with
your wide open eyes you, Old Man?

177
00:22:19,338 --> 00:22:20,362
Old Man?

178
00:22:20,672 --> 00:22:23,971
He is not an old man, he is Rajaji

179
00:22:24,209 --> 00:22:26,302
Dadaji (grandfather)?

180
00:22:27,145 --> 00:22:30,410
Friends, come and greet our grandfather

181
00:22:30,649 --> 00:22:32,810
Namaste, dadaji, namaste!

182
00:22:33,885 --> 00:22:35,853
Gauri, hey, Gauri!

183
00:22:36,154 --> 00:22:38,452
You have made my life unbearable

184
00:22:38,690 --> 00:22:40,590
You are forever in trouble

185
00:22:40,859 --> 00:22:42,087
Come, come on home, come along

186
00:22:42,327 --> 00:22:43,817
Let me go, let go, please

187
00:22:44,596 --> 00:22:47,622
Ahh, what a sight for sore eyes!

188
00:22:47,866 --> 00:22:49,424
What a piece!

189
00:22:50,435 --> 00:22:52,369
You have also become naughty
with these children

190
00:22:52,604 --> 00:22:55,903
Hey, not what a piece, she`s a big piece

191
00:22:56,141 --> 00:22:57,972
She's more like a buffalow

192
00:22:58,243 --> 00:22:59,437
What?

193
00:22:59,911 --> 00:23:03,176
Her waist is the size of a barrel

194
00:23:03,448 --> 00:23:07,350
Dolt. I am not talking about
the big woman,

195
00:23:08,286 --> 00:23:10,550
I am talking about the little one

196
00:23:10,922 --> 00:23:14,187
Beautiful, beautiful!

197
00:23:14,793 --> 00:23:16,624
Why are you laughing?

198
00:23:17,229 --> 00:23:19,891
You have grown up but still
as playful as a child

199
00:23:20,132 --> 00:23:21,929
When will you get some
sense in your head?

200
00:23:22,167 --> 00:23:24,635
When I have not lost it, the question of
getting it back doesn't arise

201
00:23:24,870 --> 00:23:27,464
Your parents died without
leaving a penny...

202
00:23:27,706 --> 00:23:29,867
and saddled us with an orphan daughter

203
00:23:30,142 --> 00:23:32,576
And your brother too
just dumped you on my head...

204
00:23:32,844 --> 00:23:34,709
... while he enjoys himself in Dubai

205
00:23:34,980 --> 00:23:38,848
Listen, Auntie. Don't say one word
against him

206
00:23:39,551 --> 00:23:42,213
It's the money he sends every month
which runs this house

207
00:23:42,521 --> 00:23:44,113
Or we would have all starved

208
00:23:44,423 --> 00:23:48,018
Enough, now go get dressed,
we have to attend a wedding

209
00:23:48,260 --> 00:23:52,253
Raja Saheb! Welcome, Raja Saheb

210
00:23:54,099 --> 00:23:58,331
I didn't think you would remember
non entities like us

211
00:23:59,304 --> 00:24:02,899
You came as an Inspector
to this area, but

212
00:24:03,575 --> 00:24:05,702
retired as the
Deputy Inspector General of Police

213
00:24:05,977 --> 00:24:09,413
How can I forget such a big man?

214
00:24:10,015 --> 00:24:11,744
I was...!

215
00:24:16,822 --> 00:24:18,687
What a piece!

216
00:24:20,425 --> 00:24:23,952
Beautiful! Wonderful!

217
00:24:25,230 --> 00:24:30,224
O Raja Saheb. Times have changed
but you haven't!

218
00:24:30,735 --> 00:24:32,327
Greetings, D.I.G. Saheb

219
00:24:32,571 --> 00:24:33,196
To you too

220
00:24:33,438 --> 00:24:35,406
Felicitations on the marriage
of your daughter

221
00:24:35,640 --> 00:24:39,007
Many thanks, Mr. Jamuna for
gracing this occasion

222
00:24:39,244 --> 00:24:41,974
Now that your daughter is married

223
00:24:42,214 --> 00:24:45,843
do give some attention to
my niece's marriage too

224
00:24:46,518 --> 00:24:52,514
Your girl is matchless, shouldn't have
any problem with her marriage

225
00:24:55,160 --> 00:24:56,889
Congratulations!

226
00:24:57,128 --> 00:25:01,758
This means Raja Saheb has taken over the
responsibility of this marriage

227
00:25:02,000 --> 00:25:03,160
Raja Saheb?!

228
00:25:03,535 --> 00:25:06,834
After all, he is the Raja. He is, he is

229
00:25:07,339 --> 00:25:10,934
Raja Saheb, many, many thanks,
very many thanks

230
00:25:11,176 --> 00:25:12,268
Greetings, Raja Saheb

231
00:25:12,544 --> 00:25:14,978
Gauri, come pay your respects
to the Raja Saheb

232
00:25:15,247 --> 00:25:17,374
He has taken over the responsibility
for your marriage

233
00:25:17,616 --> 00:25:19,846
Bow to him, bow to him

234
00:25:26,458 --> 00:25:33,022
Raja Saheb, the girl has turned away,
it means things will work out!

235
00:25:47,112 --> 00:25:48,670
Gauri?

236
00:25:50,782 --> 00:25:52,545
Gauri

237
00:25:54,920 --> 00:25:57,787
Gauri called me. I'm coming

238
00:25:58,023 --> 00:26:01,891
Wait, Gauri, wait, I am coming.

239
00:26:02,561 --> 00:26:03,425
Gauri

240
00:26:03,662 --> 00:26:05,186
Raja Saheb

241
00:26:06,197 --> 00:26:07,687
Gauri

242
00:26:12,904 --> 00:26:14,599
What is going on?

243
00:26:14,839 --> 00:26:19,173
Going on? It is you who were going,
I caught you

244
00:26:21,613 --> 00:26:23,376
Get up

245
00:26:25,550 --> 00:26:29,418
Take my hand. Oh, my back is giving away

246
00:26:32,023 --> 00:26:36,255
Your pulse is throbbing like a water pump!

247
00:26:36,995 --> 00:26:40,226
This is all due to Gauri

248
00:26:41,099 --> 00:26:48,631
At the thought of her not just the pulse
but everything starts throbbing

249
00:26:49,507 --> 00:26:51,270
Everything?

250
00:26:51,710 --> 00:26:56,340
That lass has bewitched me

251
00:26:57,215 --> 00:27:01,311
Wherever I look, it is her I see

252
00:27:01,620 --> 00:27:06,819
Raja Saheb, just don't see her
at the window

253
00:27:07,859 --> 00:27:10,157
or you are sure to lose your limbs

254
00:27:10,395 --> 00:27:12,625
Don't force this marriage on me, Auntie

255
00:27:12,864 --> 00:27:14,491
I will not marry someone
I have not seen or known

256
00:27:14,733 --> 00:27:18,100
Friends, can I marry without
seeing the boy?

257
00:27:18,336 --> 00:27:19,997
No, no, never

258
00:27:20,405 --> 00:27:23,704
See!
Quiet, you devils. Go away, scram

259
00:27:24,075 --> 00:27:29,206
We are like your parents
We only have your welfare at heart

260
00:27:29,481 --> 00:27:33,212
And, after all, he is a very big man

261
00:27:33,518 --> 00:27:35,042
But...
He is very rich

262
00:27:35,353 --> 00:27:36,650
It will be a life of luxury

263
00:27:36,888 --> 00:27:38,753
You will live like a queen,
you wretched girl!

264
00:27:38,990 --> 00:27:41,584
Damn! Queen or empress

265
00:27:41,826 --> 00:27:45,523
I will not agree until I have
seen the boy's face

266
00:27:46,231 --> 00:27:50,565
God, what a fix! Raja Saheb's face
isn't worth looking at!

267
00:27:51,302 --> 00:27:52,860
Gopal!

268
00:27:54,572 --> 00:27:57,097
Bring over the horse if it is ready

269
00:28:04,749 --> 00:28:06,717
What are you staring at?

270
00:28:07,052 --> 00:28:09,919
Are you not dumb?

271
00:28:10,455 --> 00:28:13,424
He who thinks me dumb is a bloody fool

272
00:28:13,725 --> 00:28:18,389
But when did you start talking?

273
00:28:18,630 --> 00:28:21,258
About 15 to 20 years ago

274
00:28:21,733 --> 00:28:23,496
You mean all these years you

275
00:28:23,735 --> 00:28:26,761
Learned your secrets by
pretending to be dumb

276
00:28:27,205 --> 00:28:30,402
You thought a mute would not be able to
reveal your secrets!

277
00:28:30,642 --> 00:28:35,409
I will tell Raja Saheb all the things
you have said about him

278
00:28:35,647 --> 00:28:39,276
No brother, please, I beg you
please forgive me

279
00:28:39,584 --> 00:28:43,486
Otherwise I will lose my life
along with my job

280
00:28:43,755 --> 00:28:47,418
Whatever happens, tell him I must

281
00:28:47,659 --> 00:28:49,923
No brother, please, no
Forgive me, this once

282
00:28:50,161 --> 00:28:52,721
Hey you lily-livered pigeon, you crazy mare,

283
00:28:52,964 --> 00:28:56,456
Shankar was only moving his lips,
it was me who was doing the talking

284
00:28:56,701 --> 00:29:00,296
Is that so?
Stop sweating all over

285
00:29:00,672 --> 00:29:02,230
Check this out

286
00:29:02,474 --> 00:29:03,907
He was only moving his lips

287
00:29:04,142 --> 00:29:07,600
We were just doing what we used to
practice in childhood

288
00:29:08,146 --> 00:29:11,673
You mean you two conspired to
make a fool of me?

289
00:29:12,250 --> 00:29:16,744
These days everyone is trying to make a
fool of the other

290
00:29:18,690 --> 00:29:20,123
Like it just happened to you

291
00:29:20,391 --> 00:29:22,552
What is it? Shall I punch you!

292
00:29:23,027 --> 00:29:25,359
Raja Saheb, Raja Saheb!

293
00:29:27,565 --> 00:29:28,463
What?

294
00:29:28,700 --> 00:29:30,429
Good news, good news!

295
00:29:30,668 --> 00:29:32,431
Auntie has agreed to the marriage

296
00:29:32,670 --> 00:29:33,602
Really?

297
00:29:33,938 --> 00:29:35,701
And so has Uncle

298
00:29:36,407 --> 00:29:37,271
And Gauri?

299
00:29:37,509 --> 00:29:38,771
She has not

300
00:29:39,310 --> 00:29:43,838
She has not? Why? What am I lacking?

301
00:29:44,482 --> 00:29:47,451
The mirror never lies. Look!

302
00:29:52,457 --> 00:29:57,451
Oh, Raja Saheb, I have a
remedy for every ill

303
00:29:58,196 --> 00:29:59,959
Why are you dejected?

304
00:30:00,198 --> 00:30:01,995
Take a look at this

305
00:30:02,233 --> 00:30:04,599
But eating this potion won't help me

306
00:30:04,836 --> 00:30:07,964
Not eating, for applying on your head!

307
00:30:08,473 --> 00:30:12,204
Black hair will definitely make a
difference to your appearance

308
00:30:12,744 --> 00:30:17,704
Maybe I can dye my hair, but what can I
do about this wrinkled face?

309
00:30:17,982 --> 00:30:20,177
How will I change this?

310
00:30:23,988 --> 00:30:33,056
Got it! I will send a
photograph instead!

311
00:30:49,180 --> 00:30:50,078
What is all this?

312
00:30:50,348 --> 00:30:52,976
We have agreed to your marriage

313
00:30:53,284 --> 00:30:54,148
Without asking me?

314
00:30:54,485 --> 00:30:56,646
Daughter, great good fortune has
come our way

315
00:30:56,955 --> 00:30:58,820
Oh, what a jewel of a man he is!

316
00:30:59,057 --> 00:31:01,719
Auntie, I have told you this earlier,
and I repeat

317
00:31:01,960 --> 00:31:05,919
I will not marry anyone without first
seeing the boy

318
00:31:06,898 --> 00:31:08,195
Look at his photograph

319
00:31:08,433 --> 00:31:11,027
If you don't like him
all these gifts will be returned

320
00:31:11,269 --> 00:31:12,361
Show me

321
00:31:12,704 --> 00:31:16,231
Here. Look, look at this photograph

322
00:31:20,278 --> 00:31:24,578
He looks like a film hero.
How handsome he is, isn't he?

323
00:31:25,183 --> 00:31:27,083
Yes, what a nice looking brother-in-law!

324
00:31:28,953 --> 00:31:31,251
Hey! She didn't even see the photo

325
00:31:31,756 --> 00:31:36,420
Gauri, where is the photograph?
Gauri, where is it?

326
00:31:45,570 --> 00:31:48,095
Brother-in-law looks like a hero

327
00:31:48,640 --> 00:31:51,905
He is good looking, eh!

328
00:32:19,070 --> 00:32:21,334
Why are you staring at me?

329
00:32:23,474 --> 00:32:25,738
You can talk?

330
00:32:26,577 --> 00:32:29,569
Yes, I can also see you

331
00:32:31,950 --> 00:32:36,887
You are only a photograph,
and photographs don't see or talk

332
00:32:37,255 --> 00:32:39,621
If you wish, I can also touch you

333
00:32:39,857 --> 00:32:42,758
Oh, really? Let's see you touch me then

334
00:39:24,929 --> 00:39:31,095
I will dance at the Raja's Wedding!

335
00:39:31,335 --> 00:39:32,927
Father!

336
00:39:33,537 --> 00:39:36,938
Raja is getting married, but
you are rejoicing!

337
00:39:37,441 --> 00:39:40,376
Hey, why are you ruining my mood?

338
00:39:40,644 --> 00:39:42,703
I am telling the truth

339
00:39:42,980 --> 00:39:44,470
Are you sure you are telling the truth?

340
00:39:44,749 --> 00:39:49,743
OK, so tell me why I am dying my hair

341
00:39:50,287 --> 00:39:52,755
To match it with your black heart!

342
00:39:53,057 --> 00:39:54,456
Wrong

343
00:39:54,925 --> 00:39:58,861
Its because I am thinking about marriage

344
00:39:59,096 --> 00:40:02,759
So, you're thinking about marriage?

345
00:40:03,000 --> 00:40:05,628
I am also going crazy thinking about it

346
00:40:05,870 --> 00:40:06,666
Right, isn't it?

347
00:40:06,904 --> 00:40:08,633
I will have to get married

348
00:40:08,873 --> 00:40:10,704
Go ahead, its high time

349
00:40:10,941 --> 00:40:13,102
Oh, consider it done already!

350
00:40:13,377 --> 00:40:15,345
Done, but with whom?

351
00:40:15,613 --> 00:40:19,982
With the one who comes to this
house every day

352
00:40:21,552 --> 00:40:26,046
The one who comes to cook every day?

353
00:40:27,091 --> 00:40:28,319
Yes, the same one

354
00:40:28,926 --> 00:40:31,451
The one who does all our housework

355
00:40:32,530 --> 00:40:38,093
Are you marrying me off to Rasili?

356
00:40:38,335 --> 00:40:40,530
Yes. What?

357
00:40:41,071 --> 00:40:45,565
Rasili is going to be my wife,
and your step mother

358
00:40:45,843 --> 00:40:50,041
No, she is going to be my wife and
your daughter-in-law

359
00:40:50,281 --> 00:40:51,543
No, she is mine

360
00:40:51,782 --> 00:40:53,272
She is mine                                                 She is mine

361
00:40:53,617 --> 00:40:54,743
She is mine

362
00:40:55,052 --> 00:40:56,076
Rasili!

363
00:40:58,756 --> 00:41:01,623
Both... Both have called together?

364
00:41:01,926 --> 00:41:02,950
Yes

365
00:41:03,994 --> 00:41:04,756
Oh, my God!

366
00:41:05,062 --> 00:41:08,259
Rasili, Rasili, you tell us
whom do you love?

367
00:41:08,499 --> 00:41:11,059
Is it the son or the son's father?

368
00:41:11,502 --> 00:41:14,198
Don't be shy, Rasili
Its time to open up

369
00:41:14,438 --> 00:41:18,238
Yes, Rasili, be as brazen as you want to

370
00:41:18,609 --> 00:41:21,635
Tell us, whom do you love?

371
00:41:22,713 --> 00:41:24,044
Please speak out                                                   Well?

372
00:41:29,353 --> 00:41:31,321
I love both!

373
00:41:40,631 --> 00:41:42,861
Please stand up for the ceremony

374
00:41:43,300 --> 00:41:46,064
The bride goes first

375
00:41:54,512 --> 00:41:56,036
Father, what is this?                                 What?

376
00:41:56,313 --> 00:41:58,611
Raja Saheb is changing the
whole marriage system

377
00:41:58,849 --> 00:41:59,474
Why?

378
00:41:59,750 --> 00:42:02,651
Like a bridegroom he was going around
his courtyard on a horse

379
00:42:02,953 --> 00:42:05,854
And now, he is also doing the
marriage ceremony himself!

380
00:42:06,090 --> 00:42:07,614
He's turned everything topsy-turvy

381
00:42:07,892 --> 00:42:12,386
Shut up! He is the Raja Saheb
Whatever he does is right

382
00:42:12,630 --> 00:42:13,995
My foot!

383
00:42:57,041 --> 00:43:00,238
Priest, continue with your chants,
this is the last round

384
00:43:00,477 --> 00:43:02,741
I will take care of her
But...!

385
00:43:04,882 --> 00:43:07,180
Keep reciting your chants

386
00:43:19,597 --> 00:43:21,656
The rounds are completed

387
00:43:21,899 --> 00:43:24,424
Now bless them

388
00:44:08,245 --> 00:44:10,236
You! I...!

389
00:44:10,514 --> 00:44:11,947
How did I come here?

390
00:44:12,249 --> 00:44:14,217
I am your husband

391
00:44:14,852 --> 00:44:17,480
I have completed the marriage ceremony

392
00:44:18,055 --> 00:44:20,990
No, no, that was no marriage ceremony

393
00:44:21,291 --> 00:44:23,156
I do not believe that ceremony

394
00:44:23,761 --> 00:44:25,854
This marriage is not acceptable to me

395
00:44:26,096 --> 00:44:29,395
You have cheated me, cheated me

396
00:44:29,767 --> 00:44:34,170
Listen sweetheart, cheating or not,

397
00:44:35,039 --> 00:44:37,473
I have won the game

398
00:44:38,075 --> 00:44:42,512
Today I will fulfill my heart's desire

399
00:44:44,048 --> 00:44:48,985
I have married you.  Marriage!

400
00:44:49,953 --> 00:44:53,116
If you come near me, I will scream

401
00:44:53,357 --> 00:44:57,088
All brides scream on wedding nights

402
00:44:58,028 --> 00:44:59,859
Go ahead and scream

403
00:45:00,097 --> 00:45:03,066
You can never have me

404
00:45:05,769 --> 00:45:07,760
Help!

405
00:45:15,045 --> 00:45:18,173
Will you kill me?

406
00:45:19,049 --> 00:45:20,812
I will kill myself!

407
00:45:21,719 --> 00:45:25,815
Gauri will never be yours, never

408
00:45:26,790 --> 00:45:28,621
I will never accept you as my husband

409
00:45:28,859 --> 00:45:31,953
I would rather be dead than accept you

410
00:45:40,838 --> 00:45:43,864
Your life is my property now

411
00:45:44,108 --> 00:45:45,837
No, never

412
00:45:46,076 --> 00:45:49,910
I have control over your life and death

413
00:45:50,447 --> 00:45:55,180
Everything is in my hands. Understand?

414
00:45:56,019 --> 00:46:00,718
If I wish I can rape you right now

415
00:46:01,925 --> 00:46:04,325
But I will not do that

416
00:46:05,662 --> 00:46:11,623
Because I want to play the game of
husband and wife with you

417
00:46:11,869 --> 00:46:13,097
Never!

418
00:46:13,370 --> 00:46:15,895
That is why I have married you

419
00:46:16,373 --> 00:46:20,833
But now I have decided that

420
00:46:21,745 --> 00:46:26,808
When I take you, it will be
with your consent

421
00:46:27,484 --> 00:46:31,716
I will wait for that day to dawn

422
00:46:32,656 --> 00:46:36,353
I will wait

423
00:46:44,034 --> 00:46:47,663
No! Never!

424
00:47:11,829 --> 00:47:17,165
You smile and put salt on my wounds

425
00:47:17,601 --> 00:47:21,332
I see, and am surprised

426
00:47:22,105 --> 00:47:27,270
You've got yourself a flower
more beautiful than me

427
00:47:28,278 --> 00:47:30,508
But its fragrance...

428
00:47:31,682 --> 00:47:35,209
you could not smell it's fragrance!

429
00:47:42,793 --> 00:47:44,124
Bindiya

430
00:47:44,494 --> 00:47:49,397
I have heard that women understand
one another

431
00:47:50,133 --> 00:47:53,330
Do something with this girl

432
00:47:53,570 --> 00:47:57,097
So that she falls madly in love with me

433
00:47:57,341 --> 00:47:58,330
Raja Saheb

434
00:47:59,543 --> 00:48:04,810
Don't argue. I will give you a fortune

435
00:48:06,049 --> 00:48:08,210
It's your job to bring that girl to
tomorrow's function, dressed as a bride

436
00:55:14,444 --> 00:55:17,538
This bullet could have
gone through you, but...

437
00:55:17,814 --> 00:55:20,442
My brother is besotted with you

438
00:55:21,017 --> 00:55:26,011
Brother loves you, and I love Brother

439
00:55:26,956 --> 00:55:30,016
Love has thwarted death

440
00:55:32,729 --> 00:55:38,190
Bloody Fool, I have lost to your resolve

441
00:55:38,902 --> 00:55:41,769
At the party, I put Bindiya
in your place

442
00:55:42,339 --> 00:55:45,570
Just to save the honour of this house

443
00:55:45,809 --> 00:55:50,576
And you tried to destroy my good name
by running away

444
00:55:51,314 --> 00:55:53,680
I will now show you

445
00:55:54,484 --> 00:55:56,679
my true colours

446
00:55:58,188 --> 00:56:00,122
I have been very patient

447
00:56:00,790 --> 00:56:03,486
You will now witness my hatred

448
00:56:04,160 --> 00:56:10,895
When you are made to starve,
you will learn to obey Raja's wishes

449
00:56:21,277 --> 00:56:24,872
Shankar, are you thinking what I am?

450
00:56:25,782 --> 00:56:29,309
It looks like the girl is
being mistreated

451
00:56:30,086 --> 00:56:32,884
I had heard that saying about
"Something being fishy"

452
00:56:33,123 --> 00:56:35,114
But this looks like the
whole blasted fish market!

453
00:56:35,425 --> 00:56:38,792
All are rogues, the buyers
and the sellers

454
00:56:39,396 --> 00:56:44,493
That is why I feel like
digging up the facts

455
00:56:47,670 --> 00:56:49,535
You talking about my father?

456
00:56:51,841 --> 00:56:54,571
Chewing tobacco? Who... Me?

457
00:56:54,844 --> 00:56:56,209
You are chewing tobacco?

458
00:56:56,880 --> 00:56:57,904
Spitting it out?

459
00:56:59,549 --> 00:57:01,540
If you chew then you are bound to spit

460
00:57:02,318 --> 00:57:06,186
Are you throwing up? Vomit...

461
00:57:09,159 --> 00:57:10,387
I get it!

462
00:57:10,627 --> 00:57:14,620
You are talking about getting my father
to spit out the secret

463
00:57:19,102 --> 00:57:21,730
Here, down another one

464
00:57:22,272 --> 00:57:25,298
Down another, down another, you say,
and make me drink...

465
00:57:25,542 --> 00:57:30,172
like they water a camel before
taking it into the desert

466
00:57:30,680 --> 00:57:33,376
Am I a camel? Am I?

467
00:57:34,517 --> 00:57:38,920
Look, my dear... you called me
and I have come

468
00:57:39,189 --> 00:57:41,851
You asked me for a drink,
and I gave it to you

469
00:57:42,091 --> 00:57:45,219
You told me to feed you, I fed you

470
00:57:46,262 --> 00:57:50,824
But why have you not quenched
my thirst so far?

471
00:57:53,369 --> 00:57:58,705
Come my lass, I'll quench your thirst

472
00:58:13,723 --> 00:58:16,157
1, 2, 3, 4, 5...!

473
00:58:16,459 --> 00:58:19,326
Hey, where did this fifth hand
come from?!

474
00:58:19,562 --> 00:58:22,725
Silly, but there are only four hands,
not five

475
00:58:22,966 --> 00:58:24,456
Count, count, count

476
00:58:24,834 --> 00:58:29,294
1, 2, 3, 4

477
00:58:30,106 --> 00:58:32,631
Eh. There are only four hands...

478
00:58:33,243 --> 00:58:35,108
Why did I see five?

479
00:58:35,378 --> 00:58:37,778
You are drunk, that's why

480
00:58:38,381 --> 00:58:40,872
Okay. I am drunk, that's why

481
00:58:56,232 --> 00:58:58,166
What happened, my love?

482
00:58:58,968 --> 00:59:02,131
Who just gave a fake pill to your love?

483
00:59:02,572 --> 00:59:05,507
The fifth hand is there
Is definitely exists!

484
00:59:06,376 --> 00:59:09,937
Five hands? Look, two mine
and two yours

485
00:59:10,380 --> 00:59:13,747
See, that's the fifth hand,
the one on your shoulder

486
00:59:14,050 --> 00:59:15,210
But this is your hand

487
00:59:15,518 --> 00:59:16,450
My hand?

488
00:59:16,753 --> 00:59:18,311
It's you who has held me all along

489
00:59:18,621 --> 00:59:23,115
How can it be my hand?
1, 2, 3, 4

490
00:59:27,230 --> 00:59:29,494
Caught it! Caught the fifth hand!

491
00:59:29,732 --> 00:59:33,361
This is not the fifth hand,
it is the hand of the Law

492
00:59:37,340 --> 00:59:41,470
He who loses courage,
falls into the hands of the Law

493
00:59:41,978 --> 00:59:45,277
But why is the law after me?

494
00:59:45,515 --> 00:59:48,973
You could've done some hanky-panky

495
00:59:49,586 --> 00:59:51,281
The whole village is talking about it

496
00:59:51,588 --> 00:59:53,988
You gave Raja Saheb such a pill that...

497
00:59:54,257 --> 00:59:57,158
all night he remained like a rusted gun

498
00:59:57,393 --> 01:00:01,227
No trigger pulled, no shots fired,
no consummation of his marriage even

499
01:00:01,464 --> 01:00:05,332
You have grossly cheated Raja Saheb

500
01:00:05,568 --> 01:00:11,131
I have cheated him?
It is he who has cheated Gauri

501
01:00:12,175 --> 01:00:13,802
What cheating are you talking about?

502
01:00:16,379 --> 01:00:19,041
Hey speak up! Where's your voice?

503
01:00:19,282 --> 01:00:22,718
How can I raise my voice,
even the winds can carry tales

504
01:00:22,986 --> 01:00:26,353
If Raja Saheb gets the wind of the
tale I've been telling you

505
01:00:26,623 --> 01:00:28,056
then he will...!

506
01:00:28,358 --> 01:00:30,622
Go on! Whisper into my ear!

507
01:00:30,860 --> 01:00:33,420
Even the wind will not hear anything

508
01:00:33,663 --> 01:00:35,358
Go on, tell me, tell me

509
01:00:50,880 --> 01:00:54,748
Shankar, that innocent girl
is suffering

510
01:00:55,084 --> 01:00:57,245
Just wait and see, their big manion will
crumble into dust

511
01:00:57,553 --> 01:00:58,850
Because God has said,

512
01:00:59,088 --> 01:01:02,251
that the tears of innocents
give birth to flames

513
01:01:02,692 --> 01:01:06,059
How disgusting, that my father is a
part of this dirty game

514
01:01:06,329 --> 01:01:08,354
And that poor girl...!

515
01:01:09,198 --> 01:01:12,929
Shankar, see what she is doing!

516
01:01:31,587 --> 01:01:32,713
You!

517
01:01:35,958 --> 01:01:39,951
You helped Raja Saheb to
bring me to this state

518
01:01:41,597 --> 01:01:45,158
You have pushed me into the
flames of this hell!

519
01:01:45,968 --> 01:01:49,028
For a handful of coin from your master,

520
01:01:49,272 --> 01:01:52,435
you have ruined my entire life!

521
01:01:53,476 --> 01:01:57,845
What a game of deception you have
played with the life of a girl!

522
01:01:58,114 --> 01:01:59,672
Such a great fraud!

523
01:02:00,049 --> 01:02:04,952
If you were not marrying me,
why did you send your photograph?

524
01:02:07,056 --> 01:02:09,923
Why did you send this photograph?

525
01:02:11,627 --> 01:02:13,254
When I saw this photograph

526
01:02:13,496 --> 01:02:16,954
I started dreaming of a life with you

527
01:02:17,834 --> 01:02:20,667
I accepted you as my honoured husband

528
01:02:20,903 --> 01:02:23,736
Made you a part of my life

529
01:02:24,507 --> 01:02:26,031
But you...

530
01:02:26,676 --> 01:02:29,076
You have ruined my life

531
01:02:29,545 --> 01:02:33,072
The photograph that was given to me
was a fraud

532
01:02:33,816 --> 01:02:37,343
and my marriage ceremony too was a fraud

533
01:02:37,653 --> 01:02:39,086
You are the root cause of all this

534
01:02:39,355 --> 01:02:40,845
Tell me, why did you do it?

535
01:02:41,157 --> 01:02:42,852
Why did you, why did you?

536
01:02:43,092 --> 01:02:45,219
Why did you do this to me?

537
01:02:46,763 --> 01:02:49,857
Why are you treating me so?

538
01:02:51,467 --> 01:02:55,494
When I wish to die, you don't let me

539
01:02:56,272 --> 01:02:59,400
What is my fault, tell me!

540
01:03:00,276 --> 01:03:04,144
Can you tell me what is my fault?

541
01:03:06,883 --> 01:03:09,181
Whom are you asking for an answer?

542
01:03:09,852 --> 01:03:11,217
Whom are you asking?

543
01:03:11,554 --> 01:03:13,613
He cannot answer any of your questions

544
01:03:13,923 --> 01:03:16,915
Perhaps you do not know that
this poor man is dumb

545
01:03:17,493 --> 01:03:19,256
Dumb, he is dumb

546
01:03:21,230 --> 01:03:24,358
In any case, whether they have a
voice or not

547
01:03:24,600 --> 01:03:27,364
the poor are always losers
in the world of the rich

548
01:03:27,837 --> 01:03:30,567
Since childhood this poor guy has been
brought up on a diet of

549
01:03:30,807 --> 01:03:32,672
Raja Saheb's ill treatment

550
01:03:32,909 --> 01:03:36,276
But he is not involved in his cruelties

551
01:03:36,879 --> 01:03:42,442
Shankar is completely innocent of
whatever has happened or is happening

552
01:03:44,720 --> 01:03:46,551
I'm...

553
01:04:11,547 --> 01:04:14,345
Raja Saheb, you have again had too much

554
01:04:14,584 --> 01:04:16,575
Yes, yes, I have drunk

555
01:04:17,220 --> 01:04:21,213
My friend has a party for my wedding

556
01:04:21,524 --> 01:04:23,389
But me, I am alone!

557
01:04:23,893 --> 01:04:24,791
No wife!

558
01:04:25,361 --> 01:04:29,320
I will break her. I will crush her pride

559
01:04:30,099 --> 01:04:34,900
My wife, she will... at my foot!

560
01:04:35,872 --> 01:04:38,966
Bloody Fool, Bloody Fool

561
01:04:47,250 --> 01:04:53,189
No, I will not be humiliated today

562
01:04:54,624 --> 01:04:59,357
I will stay awake and keep you awake too

563
01:05:00,496 --> 01:05:07,868
Look, I've just washed my face
with cold water

564
01:05:09,071 --> 01:05:13,940
I am sitting with my eyes wide open

565
01:05:14,810 --> 01:05:17,973
Take off your clothes, quickly

566
01:05:31,594 --> 01:05:35,325
Raja Saheb, I am ready

567
01:05:37,867 --> 01:05:39,357
Raja Saheb

568
01:05:40,269 --> 01:05:42,066
Raja Saheb!

569
01:05:54,717 --> 01:05:59,279
Shankar. It is the thirsty man
who goes to the spring

570
01:05:59,588 --> 01:06:04,719
But today the spring is asking you to
quench its thirst!

571
01:06:08,864 --> 01:06:10,889
Quench my thirst, Shankar

572
01:06:11,133 --> 01:06:12,395
Quench my thirst

573
01:06:13,002 --> 01:06:14,094
Shankar

574
01:06:15,404 --> 01:06:18,100
I will, I will

575
01:06:24,580 --> 01:06:25,137
You!

576
01:06:25,414 --> 01:06:27,905
You, the thirsty spring

577
01:06:29,418 --> 01:06:32,285
And I am the whirlpool of youth

578
01:06:33,723 --> 01:06:37,625
Come, drown in my depths

579
01:06:37,893 --> 01:06:39,884
Quench it, quench it

580
01:06:40,129 --> 01:06:42,154
Quench your thirst

581
01:06:43,699 --> 01:06:46,429
No, stop it!

582
01:06:46,669 --> 01:06:50,230
Nobody can help you now

583
01:06:53,342 --> 01:06:55,037
Stop!

584
01:07:01,150 --> 01:07:02,742
Shankar!

585
01:07:22,571 --> 01:07:24,664
Shankar, help!

586
01:07:24,907 --> 01:07:25,931
No!

587
01:07:26,909 --> 01:07:28,900
Shankar!

588
01:07:32,615 --> 01:07:34,207
Help me!

589
01:07:50,332 --> 01:07:51,492
Shankar!

590
01:08:23,799 --> 01:08:25,699
Want to beat me?

591
01:08:26,836 --> 01:08:28,064
Go on

592
01:08:30,406 --> 01:08:32,135
Hit me, will you?

593
01:08:33,342 --> 01:08:34,673
Hit me?

594
01:08:37,213 --> 01:08:39,477
You laid hands on Birjwa

595
01:08:41,283 --> 01:08:44,252
This is your place, under my shoe

596
01:08:44,520 --> 01:08:46,010
Worthless slave

597
01:08:48,491 --> 01:08:51,756
No, Birjwa, leave him

598
01:08:52,361 --> 01:08:54,488
You interfered in my matters

599
01:08:56,432 --> 01:08:58,024
No Birjwa, no!

600
01:08:58,300 --> 01:08:59,358
How dare you!

601
01:08:59,602 --> 01:09:00,466
Don't hit him

602
01:09:03,105 --> 01:09:04,129
Birjwa

603
01:09:04,540 --> 01:09:05,905
Bloody bastard!

604
01:09:08,077 --> 01:09:10,705
Hey, Birjwa, what's happened?

605
01:09:10,980 --> 01:09:12,675
Why are you beating Shankar?

606
01:09:12,915 --> 01:09:13,882
Ask him

607
01:09:14,283 --> 01:09:18,720
How he enjoys himself with Bindiya
when you fall asleep

608
01:09:19,188 --> 01:09:22,385
I've caught them red-handed today

609
01:09:47,449 --> 01:09:50,145
No, no, don't hit him

610
01:09:50,719 --> 01:09:52,550
It was me who went to him

611
01:09:52,788 --> 01:09:54,779
I am at fault, don't beat him

612
01:09:55,090 --> 01:09:59,618
Wretch, you cheated me

613
01:10:00,930 --> 01:10:03,194
You went to my servant?

614
01:10:06,569 --> 01:10:14,374
I will teach you a lesson you will not
forget all your life

615
01:10:29,525 --> 01:10:35,259
Chanda Bai, this fake jewel of my mansion

616
01:10:35,497 --> 01:10:38,830
is fit to be sold every night

617
01:10:39,301 --> 01:10:41,235
She doesn't belong to my mansion anymore

618
01:10:43,038 --> 01:10:45,472
but to your Salon

619
01:10:45,841 --> 01:10:47,399
Bloody Fool!

620
01:11:34,456 --> 01:11:39,689
Forgive me, Shankar. I misunderstood you.

621
01:13:16,658 --> 01:13:19,024
Daughter, a woman's husband is her god;

622
01:13:19,261 --> 01:13:21,821
it is her prime duty to serve him

623
01:13:22,064 --> 01:13:26,694
All her life is for her husband

624
01:13:27,369 --> 01:13:29,701
Hold his image in your mind and say

625
01:13:29,938 --> 01:13:34,034
Say it with me: "My husband is my god"

626
01:13:36,145 --> 01:13:39,342
See his image in your heart

627
01:13:39,581 --> 01:13:41,412
Only his image

628
01:13:45,754 --> 01:13:48,746
Repeat after me: "My husband is my god"

629
01:13:49,057 --> 01:13:52,254
"It is my duty to obey him."

630
01:13:55,998 --> 01:13:59,729
Sai it, dear: "My husband is my god."

631
01:14:14,883 --> 01:14:16,578
Say it, daughter. Say it.

632
01:21:32,821 --> 01:21:34,846
Ashok brother is here,
brother Ashok is here!

633
01:21:35,156 --> 01:21:36,316
Hey, you all are very naughty

634
01:21:36,558 --> 01:21:38,719
What is in common?

635
01:21:38,960 --> 01:21:40,484
Brother Ashok has come

636
01:21:40,729 --> 01:21:42,458
Brother Ashok has come

637
01:21:42,697 --> 01:21:43,561
Ashok!

638
01:21:44,065 --> 01:21:46,966
Look, Ashok has come!

639
01:21:47,202 --> 01:21:48,066
Here, take this

640
01:21:49,704 --> 01:21:51,228
Have you come then?
But why didn't you write?

641
01:21:51,473 --> 01:21:52,337
Bless you, son, bless you

642
01:21:52,574 --> 01:21:53,541
We have been missing you so much

643
01:21:54,409 --> 01:21:56,036
We are seeing you after so long!

644
01:21:56,311 --> 01:21:58,302
What did you bring for uns from Dubai?

645
01:21:58,947 --> 01:21:59,777
Where is Gauri?

646
01:22:00,015 --> 01:22:01,277
Sister Gauri has gone

647
01:22:03,585 --> 01:22:04,779
Daughters don't stay in their
parental homes forever

648
01:22:05,086 --> 01:22:06,986
Why? Didn't you get the wedding card?

649
01:22:07,622 --> 01:22:09,487
What? Wedding?

650
01:22:09,724 --> 01:22:12,625
You people have married off my sister?

651
01:22:12,861 --> 01:22:14,488
Without consulting me?

652
01:22:14,729 --> 01:22:16,196
Where? To whom?

653
01:22:16,431 --> 01:22:19,332
Son, she is living like a
queen in the mansion

654
01:22:19,567 --> 01:22:20,932
I just cannot tell you how

655
01:22:21,169 --> 01:22:22,761
Very fortunate she is, my son

656
01:22:23,071 --> 01:22:26,404
and he is a real king, not in name only

657
01:22:27,976 --> 01:22:29,341
Raja!

658
01:22:37,752 --> 01:22:39,777
Here's a telegram from your brother

659
01:22:40,555 --> 01:22:42,386
He is coming to meet you

660
01:22:42,958 --> 01:22:49,261
If you become emotional and
talk about our family matter

661
01:22:50,565 --> 01:22:54,194
then, in front of you
your brother will be

662
01:22:59,074 --> 01:23:00,200
Where is Raja Saheb?

663
01:23:00,375 --> 01:23:02,935
Here I am, brother-in-law

664
01:23:09,951 --> 01:23:10,679
You?!

665
01:23:10,986 --> 01:23:15,889
Yes, I am her life partner

666
01:23:17,192 --> 01:23:18,386
Yes, brother

667
01:23:18,626 --> 01:23:20,821
He is your brother-in-law

668
01:23:25,233 --> 01:23:28,100
Brother!

669
01:23:30,972 --> 01:23:32,667
Why are you crying?

670
01:23:33,341 --> 01:23:36,208
Why didn't you come to my wedding?
Gauri!

671
01:23:36,845 --> 01:23:39,575
I wish you were there to send me off

672
01:23:39,814 --> 01:23:42,374
I only found out on coming here

673
01:23:42,684 --> 01:23:44,379
that you had got married

674
01:23:44,919 --> 01:23:48,650
Brother, if only you had come
just as suddenly at my wedding

675
01:23:48,890 --> 01:23:51,882
then I would have had
no cause for regret

676
01:23:54,662 --> 01:23:57,529
Gauri, aren't you happy?

677
01:23:59,234 --> 01:24:01,600
But I am happy, brother

678
01:24:01,836 --> 01:24:03,963
No brother. I am happy. Very happy.

679
01:24:04,539 --> 01:24:08,873
I doubt any other woman has
so much happiness as I do

680
01:24:09,778 --> 01:24:13,714
I had never dreamt that
I could be so happy

681
01:24:14,682 --> 01:24:17,378
See all this, brother

682
01:24:18,086 --> 01:24:19,849
This grand mansion

683
01:24:20,121 --> 01:24:22,919
and my position here

684
01:24:24,325 --> 01:24:27,988
Gauri, I had some doubts
before coming here

685
01:24:28,229 --> 01:24:32,461
but seeing how happy you are
has relieved me

686
01:24:33,101 --> 01:24:35,535
Now I can go back with a light heart

687
01:24:36,071 --> 01:24:37,333
Raja Saheb,

688
01:24:37,572 --> 01:24:40,336
I will remain forever grateful to you

689
01:24:40,575 --> 01:24:44,511
You have crowned our poverty
with your wealth

690
01:24:45,080 --> 01:24:47,048
I will take your leave now

691
01:24:47,615 --> 01:24:51,312
Oh, wait a while
Have a rest, some refreshment

692
01:24:51,619 --> 01:24:53,052
You have just arrived

693
01:24:53,455 --> 01:24:58,085
Many thanks, but it is
against our culture to take

694
01:24:58,326 --> 01:25:01,693
food or drink from a
younger sister's home

695
01:25:01,930 --> 01:25:04,194
Yes, there you are right

696
01:25:05,733 --> 01:25:07,064
Very well

697
01:25:07,836 --> 01:25:10,828
How can I go against your customs?

698
01:25:11,072 --> 01:25:12,767
You may go

699
01:25:14,509 --> 01:25:16,670
Farewell

700
01:25:45,373 --> 01:25:48,001
Please stop the carriage for a minute

701
01:25:51,913 --> 01:25:53,574
What's the matter?

702
01:25:58,586 --> 01:26:00,383
What are you saying?

703
01:26:05,994 --> 01:26:08,019
I don't follow you

704
01:26:23,344 --> 01:26:25,539
Your sister's marriage is a fraud

705
01:26:25,813 --> 01:26:27,872
Take her away from here

706
01:26:30,084 --> 01:26:30,948
No

707
01:26:31,352 --> 01:26:32,683
Seeing you this way has made me mad!

708
01:26:36,491 --> 01:26:37,924
The demon inside me is unleashed!

709
01:26:39,561 --> 01:26:43,019
I will not spare you today

710
01:26:51,973 --> 01:26:53,065
Gauri!

711
01:26:53,575 --> 01:26:56,567
Your life has been destroyed

712
01:26:57,445 --> 01:27:00,471
But you remained silent

713
01:27:01,182 --> 01:27:03,013
Please go away from here, brother

714
01:27:03,318 --> 01:27:06,651
You don't know how dangerous
these people are

715
01:27:08,523 --> 01:27:14,359
You have heaped injustice on my
innocent sister

716
01:27:15,029 --> 01:27:19,625
In the name of marriage you have
perpetrated a fraud on my sister

717
01:27:20,969 --> 01:27:25,736
My sister will not spend
another minute in this hell

718
01:27:25,974 --> 01:27:27,134
Come on, sister

719
01:27:27,675 --> 01:27:28,767
Brother!

720
01:27:33,448 --> 01:27:39,148
You think you can take my wife away?

721
01:27:39,921 --> 01:27:44,324
This mansion is a cage

722
01:27:45,260 --> 01:27:48,991
and death is hovering at all its doors

723
01:27:49,697 --> 01:27:52,029
You have entered the jaws of death

724
01:27:52,267 --> 01:27:53,859
Brother!

725
01:27:56,471 --> 01:27:57,768
Brother!

726
01:28:01,309 --> 01:28:02,571
Brother

727
01:28:06,114 --> 01:28:07,581
Brother

728
01:28:17,959 --> 01:28:20,484
Let my brother go
