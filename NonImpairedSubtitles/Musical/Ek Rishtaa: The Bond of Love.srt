1
00:02:25,472 --> 00:02:28,339
Famed industrialist Vijay Kapoor's
companies and factories...

2
00:02:28,541 --> 00:02:33,240
are already mortgaged. Now the court
has ordered the auctions

3
00:02:33,713 --> 00:02:38,047
We tried to find out
Vijay Kapoor's reactions

4
00:02:38,318 --> 00:02:40,582
But he isn't talking
to the press or the media

5
00:03:15,488 --> 00:03:24,658
Medicines cure these ailments. But
for wounds, there are no cures...

6
00:03:26,533 --> 00:03:29,093
not for those inflicted upon you
by ones who are your own

7
00:03:32,038 --> 00:03:37,499
Relationships... I heard
they fraught fraternities, Pratima

8
00:03:38,611 --> 00:03:45,449
Mine... oh they have broken me
so completely

9
00:05:06,332 --> 00:05:08,425
"The king..."

10
00:05:08,735 --> 00:05:11,033
"the queen..."

11
00:05:11,571 --> 00:05:16,634
"oh, they are young,
and they are rich"

12
00:05:16,943 --> 00:05:31,722
"What's left to ask for?
This is all Destiny's doing"

13
00:05:31,958 --> 00:05:36,395
"It's what your love
has done for us"

14
00:05:36,763 --> 00:05:46,502
"What's left for asking?"

15
00:06:07,060 --> 00:06:12,054
"My home is my temple
you are my God"

16
00:06:12,398 --> 00:06:17,062
"You are my prayer answered"

17
00:06:17,370 --> 00:06:22,034
"Who else would love me so much?"

18
00:06:22,275 --> 00:06:26,735
"Who else would give me
so much happiness?"

19
00:06:28,948 --> 00:06:34,147
"At your feet, I wish to stay"

20
00:06:34,354 --> 00:06:39,257
"In your arms, I want lifetime"

21
00:06:39,525 --> 00:06:48,923
"What else is left for asking?"

22
00:07:39,018 --> 00:07:43,455
"Like blossoms,
that gift of nature..."

23
00:07:43,790 --> 00:07:48,818
"are our parents to us"

24
00:07:49,095 --> 00:07:53,794
"Every day I have prayed for you"

25
00:07:54,033 --> 00:07:59,300
"And every dream of mine
comes true, at last"

26
00:07:59,572 --> 00:08:04,339
"These relationships
are to be nurtured"

27
00:08:04,610 --> 00:08:09,445
"And once my prayers are answered..."

28
00:08:09,715 --> 00:08:19,181
"what more will be left to seek
out of life?"

29
00:08:19,392 --> 00:08:24,227
"There is a king,
there is a queen"

30
00:08:24,430 --> 00:08:29,094
"They are mementos
of your love"

31
00:08:29,469 --> 00:08:34,372
"This is all Destiny's doing"

32
00:08:34,540 --> 00:08:39,443
"It's all His doing; everywhere,
His blessings abound"

33
00:08:39,645 --> 00:08:59,863
"What more is left
to seek of life?"

34
00:09:01,400 --> 00:09:06,804
Three imperatives for the successful
management of any enterprise

35
00:09:07,440 --> 00:09:12,571
The ownership, the management,
the worker

36
00:09:14,881 --> 00:09:21,286
Workers are known to have
grouses against companies

37
00:09:22,288 --> 00:09:27,351
There are owner-worker problems,
management's and workforce don't gel

38
00:09:28,094 --> 00:09:34,329
But it is the ownership which is
responsible and answerable

39
00:09:34,834 --> 00:09:39,533
In situations like these,
once a month...

40
00:09:39,772 --> 00:09:44,436
if owners were to make the workers
and the management's meet...

41
00:09:44,744 --> 00:09:52,116
to talk out things, then
a relationship is struck...

42
00:09:52,351 --> 00:09:55,878
between ownership, management
and workers. That is when...

43
00:09:56,122 --> 00:10:00,422
the entire establishment is organized,
woven into a strong family

44
00:10:02,595 --> 00:10:08,329
And as far as I know, no family in
the world has ever suffered a strike

45
00:10:08,734 --> 00:10:12,261
Therefore I am confident
when I say this...

46
00:10:12,505 --> 00:10:19,934
The legacy of strikes, this problem
of sick industries...

47
00:10:20,112 --> 00:10:23,275
will be rooted out
once and for all

48
00:10:38,464 --> 00:10:42,628
You were in there, weren't you?
- Yes sir

49
00:10:42,902 --> 00:10:49,967
You didn't like what I said?
- While the others listened...

50
00:10:50,242 --> 00:10:54,508
I was entranced by what you said.
By the time I came around...

51
00:10:54,747 --> 00:10:57,773
the round of applause was over

52
00:11:01,053 --> 00:11:05,387
All my life I had seen you only
in the pictures. I keep collecting...

53
00:11:05,625 --> 00:11:09,561
your articles, your interviews.
Do take a look, please

54
00:11:15,935 --> 00:11:21,032
What's your name?
- Rajesh Purohit

55
00:11:21,507 --> 00:11:25,102
I have an MBA from
Allahabad University

56
00:11:25,444 --> 00:11:30,507
Yes! Same university as yours

57
00:11:30,983 --> 00:11:35,443
What have you been doing of late?
- I'd rather tell you...

58
00:11:35,755 --> 00:11:39,987
what I wish to achieve. From you,
the one who propelled...

59
00:11:40,092 --> 00:11:47,726
Kapoor Industries to such heights,
if I could learn something...

60
00:11:48,067 --> 00:11:53,300
about achieving, then I will consider
myself a very successful man, sir

61
00:11:57,443 --> 00:12:04,246
Why not see me in my office tomorrow?
- Yes sir! Thank you sir

62
00:12:13,359 --> 00:12:16,328
Sir, you wanted the list
of textile mills

63
00:12:17,596 --> 00:12:22,761
Papa, I'm stuck at the crosswords!
- My child, I'm at the office

64
00:12:23,002 --> 00:12:26,870
The clue is "Commerce, business".
The answer is in four letters

65
00:12:27,106 --> 00:12:31,770
Four letters?
"Ro-z-ga-r" (Wage)

66
00:12:31,977 --> 00:12:33,342
"Ro-z-ga-r" (Wage)

67
00:12:36,582 --> 00:12:43,146
Papa, I could browse whole
dictionaries, but this one...

68
00:12:43,355 --> 00:12:46,916
I'd never find. You want the clue?
"Greens, out of farm"

69
00:12:47,126 --> 00:12:53,361
Four letters, this one.
- Five...?

70
00:12:53,666 --> 00:12:55,497
"Tar-o-ta-za"
(Fresh)

71
00:12:55,701 --> 00:12:57,191
"Tar-o-ta-za"
(Fresh)

72
00:12:57,336 --> 00:13:00,897
Yes, "Tar-o-ta-za"
(Fresh)

73
00:13:02,041 --> 00:13:04,475
One minute, Preeti!
- No please! Last, last

74
00:13:04,710 --> 00:13:07,076
Rajesh, why don't you go over and
help Preeti solve her crossword?

75
00:13:07,313 --> 00:13:08,473
Give me the file

76
00:13:15,921 --> 00:13:21,655
Come on in. Papa sends you?

77
00:13:21,861 --> 00:13:23,988
Yes.
- Come on, sit

78
00:13:24,296 --> 00:13:32,226
Rajesh, you want to solve crosswords?
All right, let's test you

79
00:13:32,505 --> 00:13:36,839
Five empties to fill

80
00:13:37,109 --> 00:13:41,170
The first, is two letters

81
00:13:41,514 --> 00:13:42,913
The second, three

82
00:13:43,015 --> 00:13:43,777
Third, four

83
00:13:43,949 --> 00:13:45,109
Fourth, five

84
00:13:45,217 --> 00:13:46,184
Fifth, six

85
00:13:46,585 --> 00:13:50,487
Each ends with "Ri"

86
00:13:50,790 --> 00:13:52,815
Start?
- Yes

87
00:13:53,159 --> 00:13:56,788
First clue, "Woman"
- "Na-ri"

88
00:13:58,430 --> 00:14:02,799
Second, "Small vessel"
- "Ga-ga-ri"

89
00:14:04,570 --> 00:14:10,338
"Government-related"
- "Sa-r-ka-ri"

90
00:14:12,444 --> 00:14:16,676
"Small-time trading"...?
- "Du-ka-n-da-ri"

91
00:14:19,185 --> 00:14:27,684
Last word. "Lawless city"
- "An-dh-er Na-g-ri"

92
00:14:32,898 --> 00:14:38,666
All the answers, pat! And I thought
no one in the world...

93
00:14:38,871 --> 00:14:44,935
is smarter, more intelligent than Dad!
You seem to be even more brilliant

94
00:14:45,311 --> 00:14:50,408
No Ms Preeti, answering 5 crosswords
doesn't make a Vijay Kapoor

95
00:14:50,716 --> 00:14:54,550
And what a magnetic personality

96
00:14:55,054 --> 00:14:58,023
Hear him, and you want to meet him.
See him and you're drawn to him

97
00:14:58,357 --> 00:15:07,891
The truth is, I worship your Daddy

98
00:15:10,502 --> 00:15:18,466
When you aren't, I pine.
When you are with me, I'm restless

99
00:15:18,844 --> 00:15:23,975
I have decided. I want to marry you.
- No! I'm not worthy enough...

100
00:15:24,316 --> 00:15:30,312
to even consider this! Mr. Kapoor
has done me a great favor

101
00:15:30,623 --> 00:15:36,152
Am I to repay him like this?
And let him berate me?

102
00:15:36,462 --> 00:15:40,091
What are you saying Rajesh...?
- To me, he is an ideal

103
00:15:40,399 --> 00:15:44,392
I can never do anything
that might hurt him

104
00:15:44,803 --> 00:15:52,141
He will have my resignation tomorrow.
I should be leaving

105
00:16:05,991 --> 00:16:11,861
Mr. Vijay, are you expecting a guest?
- Someday, one's daughter leaves

106
00:16:13,265 --> 00:16:17,531
The boy is coming today.
- To meet our Preeti

107
00:16:17,870 --> 00:16:24,332
Just watch this, dear brother-in-law.
Wedding's happening in no time

108
00:16:24,643 --> 00:16:28,773
But which family? Who's the boy?

109
00:16:38,223 --> 00:16:44,184
This is my home, not office, Rajesh.
A guest invited to dinner...

110
00:16:44,430 --> 00:16:46,398
isn't expected to ask for permission
to come in

111
00:16:52,004 --> 00:16:55,735
Papa! How did you get to know...?

112
00:17:02,448 --> 00:17:05,246
It's your happiness I cherish

113
00:17:06,118 --> 00:17:07,449
Be seated, Rajesh

114
00:17:08,220 --> 00:17:14,955
Your parents... your family... why
is no one else here from your side?

115
00:17:15,594 --> 00:17:19,394
I'm an orphan, sir.
I'm the only family I have

116
00:17:19,732 --> 00:17:22,758
So what? When Pratima and I
got married, all we had...

117
00:17:22,935 --> 00:17:25,495
were a pair of dresses each.
And by and by...

118
00:17:25,671 --> 00:17:27,866
by dint of my efforts,
I built this empire

119
00:17:28,173 --> 00:17:33,941
And throughout this journey,
all I had were Pratima and God

120
00:17:34,213 --> 00:17:36,408
One bad decision.

121
00:17:36,615 --> 00:17:39,140
Hey, you're getting married!
- Such is the jet age

122
00:17:39,418 --> 00:17:42,683
Discussions aren't under way yet,
and here's a wedding on the cards

123
00:17:42,821 --> 00:17:46,917
But this wedding isn't happening
without Ajay

124
00:17:47,126 --> 00:17:52,291
Rajesh, Ajay is my son. He's away
vacationing after his final semester

125
00:17:52,531 --> 00:17:55,659
As soon as he's back, we'll just
pack the two of you off

126
00:18:19,291 --> 00:18:32,796
"My wild heart
is looking for a beauty"

127
00:18:33,405 --> 00:18:38,069
"But who she is..."

128
00:18:38,277 --> 00:18:41,440
"I don't even know"

129
00:19:20,285 --> 00:19:23,652
"Someday she will come to me..."

130
00:19:23,922 --> 00:19:27,358
"someday, she will bring love"

131
00:19:27,659 --> 00:19:31,095
"I will kiss her"

132
00:19:31,463 --> 00:19:35,092
"I will embrace her"

133
00:19:35,434 --> 00:19:39,564
"I'm the pretty dream in her eyes"

134
00:19:39,771 --> 00:19:50,375
"Oh, I'm so eager to see her"

135
00:19:50,782 --> 00:19:56,516
"My wild heart
is looking for a beauty"

136
00:19:58,357 --> 00:20:01,724
"But who she is..."

137
00:20:02,094 --> 00:20:04,221
"I don't even know"

138
00:20:04,496 --> 00:20:12,870
"My wild heart
is looking for a beauty"

139
00:20:36,662 --> 00:20:39,893
"But how do I describe him?"

140
00:20:40,332 --> 00:20:43,733
"Oh, he's a wild one"

141
00:20:44,069 --> 00:20:51,237
"He's one-in-a-million,
he's my lover"

142
00:20:51,677 --> 00:20:56,205
"In my dreams he flirts with me"

143
00:20:56,481 --> 00:20:59,314
"Oh what a darling"

144
00:20:59,518 --> 00:21:06,617
"Someday, I'll surely get him"

145
00:21:07,059 --> 00:21:10,426
"But who she is..."

146
00:21:10,629 --> 00:21:14,224
"I don't even know"

147
00:21:14,499 --> 00:21:21,132
"My wild heart
is looking for a handsome man"

148
00:21:22,441 --> 00:21:28,937
"My wild heart
is looking for a handsome man"

149
00:21:44,930 --> 00:21:48,388
"Hey beauty, what's your name?"

150
00:21:48,600 --> 00:21:51,967
"None of your business"

151
00:21:52,304 --> 00:21:56,001
"Hey, you're stuck-up. Slow down"

152
00:21:56,208 --> 00:21:59,939
"You're insolent. Get lost"

153
00:22:00,178 --> 00:22:03,511
"Don't you show me your temper.
- Don't you try to flirt"

154
00:22:03,782 --> 00:22:07,343
"You won't give in so easily?
- I know your type"

155
00:22:07,653 --> 00:22:13,614
"You're drunk!
- But I think..."

156
00:22:13,859 --> 00:22:22,665
"you're quite helpless.
Who are you...?"

157
00:22:22,934 --> 00:22:26,836
"Who you are, I don't even know"

158
00:22:46,058 --> 00:22:47,992
Hey, I'm still single, I swear

159
00:22:51,263 --> 00:22:55,597
My dark little, darling sister

160
00:23:07,913 --> 00:23:10,677
How's my son?
- I'm fine

161
00:23:14,386 --> 00:23:21,189
Look at her! Time so soon for
my little blossom to get married?

162
00:23:23,695 --> 00:23:28,223
Looking so pretty... and the henna
on your hands too?

163
00:23:28,533 --> 00:23:32,697
May God bestow upon these hands
all the happiness, forever

164
00:23:33,038 --> 00:23:35,404
Where's Papa?

165
00:23:35,640 --> 00:23:37,835
I'll find him.
Stay put

166
00:23:38,076 --> 00:23:45,073
No sir, please! This apartment,
this car, servants...

167
00:23:45,283 --> 00:23:51,745
this sudden payhike, for no reason,
oh please don't be so kind to me

168
00:23:55,994 --> 00:24:00,954
I promise, I'll make Preeti
very happy, I'll pamper her

169
00:24:01,266 --> 00:24:08,001
But I want to be a self-made man.
I don't want to compromise my ideals

170
00:24:10,175 --> 00:24:18,549
Look Rajesh, had Preety married into
a big family, I would've liked them...

171
00:24:18,784 --> 00:24:30,889
to care for her like a daughter. Not
as a son-in-law, more like a son...

172
00:24:32,164 --> 00:24:34,724
can you not live in our house?
Like a member of our family?

173
00:24:34,933 --> 00:24:37,925
Come, share our joys, our sorrows

174
00:24:50,749 --> 00:24:52,944
Why is God sending so much happiness
an orphan's way?

175
00:24:54,853 --> 00:24:56,912
Parents, brothers, sisters,
relationships...

176
00:24:57,155 --> 00:25:02,957
for me, they were mere words.
Meanings, I never even knew

177
00:25:03,295 --> 00:25:10,792
All this for me, in this very
lifetime? I can't believe this!

178
00:25:18,643 --> 00:25:21,339
Couldn't be a better man for Preeti,
not in this world

179
00:25:21,480 --> 00:25:27,441
And you, Mummy-Papa's choice,
Preeti's paramour...

180
00:25:27,686 --> 00:25:28,914
are my friend

181
00:25:31,456 --> 00:25:32,548
Welcome...

182
00:25:32,757 --> 00:25:34,281
oh hello...

183
00:25:34,459 --> 00:25:35,585
hi lady... welcome

184
00:25:35,727 --> 00:25:38,696
Welcome... welcome...

185
00:25:38,930 --> 00:25:42,832
this smile is giving me a jaw-ache.
This was one offer I couldn't refuse

186
00:25:50,709 --> 00:25:55,476
How about a kiss?
Don't make me pine

187
00:25:55,714 --> 00:25:57,409
What...?
- You're my heartthrob

188
00:25:57,716 --> 00:26:03,245
My heart goes out to you.
- You lazy laggard

189
00:26:03,455 --> 00:26:07,915
Roadside Romeo! Savage!
Beast! Blackheart

190
00:26:08,293 --> 00:26:14,129
O'heartless one, your every torment
I shall bear. But I swear by you...

191
00:26:14,332 --> 00:26:18,462
you I have given my heart to!
- Uneducated loafer!

192
00:26:18,737 --> 00:26:24,369
You're insane! While you wait,
someone will whisk me away

193
00:26:24,543 --> 00:26:25,510
No!

194
00:26:25,710 --> 00:26:26,972
This no filmi plot

195
00:26:27,379 --> 00:26:29,347
And I'm not insane

196
00:26:29,581 --> 00:26:31,708
This is no love triangle

197
00:26:32,050 --> 00:26:40,617
Just a simple straight love story.
A tale of twosomes...

198
00:26:40,792 --> 00:26:46,321
like Romeo and Juliet,
Laddoo and Sweety

199
00:26:46,932 --> 00:26:51,028
Moron! The legendary lovers
never married in the end

200
00:26:51,303 --> 00:26:55,000
The committed suicide, or they were
killed. Spare me, I don't want to die

201
00:26:55,240 --> 00:26:56,730
Something is stirring in my heart.
- And then...?

202
00:26:56,875 --> 00:26:58,308
I'm in love
- And then...?

203
00:26:58,543 --> 00:27:00,067
Love is never defeated.
- And then...?

204
00:27:00,245 --> 00:27:01,644
I'm no less a man!
- And then...?

205
00:27:01,813 --> 00:27:03,974
I'm your prince charming!
- And then...?

206
00:27:04,215 --> 00:27:06,649
The lover will carry his bride away!
- And then...?

207
00:27:06,885 --> 00:27:08,785
Still stuck at "then"...?

208
00:27:08,987 --> 00:27:10,887
All superhits films, no?
- So...?

209
00:27:11,156 --> 00:27:16,389
Coming for a long drive?
- First get me a drink

210
00:27:16,661 --> 00:27:23,123
For attending my daughter's wedding,
for receiving my guests...

211
00:27:23,401 --> 00:27:32,901
I don't want to thank you. Because
your debts I can never pay off...

212
00:27:33,178 --> 00:27:39,014
with thanks.
- Sir, why embarrass us?

213
00:27:39,351 --> 00:27:43,117
Can we ever forget your debt?
- What a thing to say

214
00:27:43,455 --> 00:27:50,623
At weddings, we fathers have only
given our daughters away

215
00:27:50,929 --> 00:27:55,332
The rest of it, you have
always shouldered

216
00:27:55,634 --> 00:28:00,435
The one who is getting married today
is our daughter. Let us do our bit

217
00:28:00,705 --> 00:28:02,969
I'm thankful.
- Farewell

218
00:28:28,199 --> 00:28:32,295
Best wishes.
- Thanks a lot

219
00:28:32,537 --> 00:28:33,731
I've just concluded
a major responsibility

220
00:28:33,905 --> 00:28:36,203
But you still have
your responsibilities

221
00:28:39,611 --> 00:28:47,245
You have always had my best wishes.
One word of friendly advice

222
00:28:47,452 --> 00:28:52,685
Tell me.
- This is a grand wedding

223
00:28:52,991 --> 00:28:57,758
But you know the business community,
more enemies, than friends

224
00:28:58,430 --> 00:29:03,390
Your competition might be enthused.
- At chess, they can't checkmate me

225
00:29:03,768 --> 00:29:11,197
Can they checkmate me in business?

226
00:29:46,211 --> 00:29:48,509
You...!
- You...?

227
00:29:48,747 --> 00:29:51,511
What are you doing here?
- That's what I want to know

228
00:29:51,716 --> 00:29:58,212
It's my best friend's sister's wedding.
- Both, my sisters

229
00:29:58,656 --> 00:30:03,491
A savage? In such a good family?
- Such God willed

230
00:30:03,828 --> 00:30:10,461
Talking about savages, ever taken
a look at yourself? At your flaws?

231
00:30:10,735 --> 00:30:12,396
None that I see

232
00:30:12,570 --> 00:30:19,999
First, you're stubborn.
Second, you have a temper

233
00:30:22,080 --> 00:30:29,418
Third, you're brainless. Fourth,
you love to flaunt your Dad's money

234
00:30:30,155 --> 00:30:36,185
Five, you haven't a dressing sense.
- And you? Ever considered yourself?

235
00:30:36,494 --> 00:30:39,691
Flaws are all you'll see.
- Can you count out a couple?

236
00:30:39,964 --> 00:30:41,329
Count.
- Go on

237
00:30:41,599 --> 00:30:45,660
One, you think you're oversmart.
- Because I'm intelligent, brilliant

238
00:30:46,004 --> 00:30:53,843
Besides, fools think I'm oversmart.
- You don't have manners!

239
00:30:54,045 --> 00:30:59,210
Let's have that announced. I you
can find anyone else who says that...

240
00:30:59,417 --> 00:31:02,181
I won't ever talk to a girl
ever again, I swear

241
00:31:02,554 --> 00:31:07,048
You're too tall.
- Inherited that

242
00:31:09,060 --> 00:31:14,464
Not to get worked up.
- Wait, I'll tell you

243
00:31:14,732 --> 00:31:15,824
Give me some time

244
00:31:22,607 --> 00:31:26,202
What does he think of himself?
Not a flaw?

245
00:31:26,611 --> 00:31:28,602
Which I am

246
00:31:34,719 --> 00:31:37,210
What's come over you?
- Your brother...

247
00:31:37,455 --> 00:31:39,889
what does he think of himself?
- Why, what happened?

248
00:31:40,158 --> 00:31:43,594
He's out of his mind.
Says, I have a temper

249
00:31:43,962 --> 00:31:47,796
Which you are.
- You...

250
00:31:47,999 --> 00:31:53,335
You have this temper, don't you?
- I'm stubborn, I flaunt my Dad's money

251
00:31:53,805 --> 00:31:58,606
I'm brainless! And no dressing sense!
- He said that?

252
00:32:00,578 --> 00:32:03,638
Those words!
- What a wonder...

253
00:32:04,048 --> 00:32:12,752
That's why I'm telling you. The flaws
I never noticed in all these years...

254
00:32:13,157 --> 00:32:16,024
Ajay makes out, he even tells you!

255
00:32:36,514 --> 00:32:38,812
Now that the education is over,
what about the future?

256
00:32:39,150 --> 00:32:44,315
I've picked up an IT major with MBA.
Maybe I'll get into IT business

257
00:32:44,555 --> 00:32:47,046
The government is promoting it too

258
00:32:47,392 --> 00:32:51,726
What are the Big Three discussing?

259
00:32:51,896 --> 00:32:58,665
Dad makes it a Big Four.
- We were discussing IT

260
00:32:59,037 --> 00:33:00,664
Ajay want to get into IT business

261
00:33:01,172 --> 00:33:04,733
Business is a fine thing
Ajay has just...

262
00:33:05,043 --> 00:33:09,844
finished studying about IT. He doesn't
have any business experience

263
00:33:10,214 --> 00:33:18,349
What did you say about experience?
- Look son, without experience...

264
00:33:18,556 --> 00:33:23,994
one stands to lose.
I'm not against business

265
00:33:24,262 --> 00:33:30,167
But I will always oppose
an amateur effort

266
00:33:30,401 --> 00:33:35,202
In IT, experience isn't necessary.
And how does one gain experience...

267
00:33:35,373 --> 00:33:38,274
without working?
- Experience is what you need...

268
00:33:38,543 --> 00:33:42,479
while taking decisions.
A successful businessman...

269
00:33:42,680 --> 00:33:46,582
is one who has the guts
to take decisions

270
00:33:47,018 --> 00:33:50,454
Books don't contain experience.
Books tell you about experience

271
00:33:50,688 --> 00:33:55,523
Ajay isn't out of his knickers.
You want him to don a suit?

272
00:33:58,596 --> 00:34:02,862
Preeti, you don't know a thing.
Ajay is a big player

273
00:34:05,503 --> 00:34:10,736
Tell me, what's your game?
I'm fixing all your matches

274
00:34:10,942 --> 00:34:16,903
Not match-fixing, this is about
girl-fixing

275
00:34:17,749 --> 00:34:24,518
Is our Ajay in love?
- All that I don't know.

276
00:34:24,856 --> 00:34:28,223
But nowadays...
- Clam up

277
00:34:28,426 --> 00:34:30,792
He's adept in finding flaws in girls!
- Hush!

278
00:34:31,095 --> 00:34:35,828
Ajay found all of five flaws
in this friend of mine, Nisha

279
00:34:36,100 --> 00:34:40,230
This is too bad! You ought
to flatter pretty girls

280
00:34:40,605 --> 00:34:45,907
I only wanted to make her presentable,
to help her understand...

281
00:34:46,110 --> 00:34:47,975
how to conduct herself
before her elders...

282
00:34:52,350 --> 00:34:55,513
You think he's joking?
- He sounds serious

283
00:34:55,853 --> 00:35:02,019
Papa! Nice opportunity to get him
married. Talk to Mr. Thapar

284
00:35:02,226 --> 00:35:04,160
No way!

285
00:35:04,529 --> 00:35:09,091
The girl's father comes asking
for an alliance

286
00:35:09,467 --> 00:35:15,463
You talk of alliances after she
and I have a nice relationship going

287
00:35:15,840 --> 00:35:19,332
And as far as rituals
are concerned...

288
00:35:19,644 --> 00:35:22,579
I have my family right here
with me

289
00:35:23,047 --> 00:35:28,713
That's Vijay Kapoor's son

290
00:35:40,798 --> 00:35:42,231
Welcome son

291
00:35:44,202 --> 00:35:45,931
That's your chair

292
00:35:46,704 --> 00:35:48,501
A father's dreams

293
00:35:51,008 --> 00:35:58,676
By dint of your hard work, you will
prove yourself worthy of that chair

294
00:35:58,983 --> 00:36:02,282
Two premises to the argument.
If you want...

295
00:36:02,520 --> 00:36:07,651
you can just walk over and sit there.
But I would like you to make it...

296
00:36:07,859 --> 00:36:09,793
by dint of hard work
and your own capabilities

297
00:36:10,161 --> 00:36:17,033
Son, the tree that has struck its
roots deep, isn't swayed by storms

298
00:36:17,335 --> 00:36:27,210
I'd rather you applied yourself
to work, and climb step by step...

299
00:36:27,478 --> 00:36:29,571
till you get there

300
00:36:30,715 --> 00:36:36,676
If you want a business of your own, by
all means, yes. But your prime duty...

301
00:36:37,021 --> 00:36:44,894
is to manage this company.
- Yes, Papa. Where do I begin?

302
00:36:52,837 --> 00:36:58,036
What are you upto? I told you
to go and get me a beer. Go on

303
00:36:58,276 --> 00:37:00,574
But Mr. Harry Singh, my machine
is running. How can I leave it?

304
00:37:01,045 --> 00:37:07,951
Machine stopped? Go, get me a beer.
Go on, what are you staring at?

305
00:37:09,120 --> 00:37:11,020
Chilled beer

306
00:37:23,201 --> 00:37:26,068
Your magic is working.
- Why what happened?

307
00:37:26,404 --> 00:37:31,774
Nisha is completely changed!
She doesn't know what a temper is

308
00:37:32,243 --> 00:37:40,082
What's being stubborn? She doesn't
even know! She's so demure

309
00:37:40,418 --> 00:37:44,218
She has even changed
the way she dresses

310
00:37:44,555 --> 00:37:49,424
Only traditional Indian clothing

311
00:37:49,727 --> 00:37:55,529
The churidar-kurta,
the salwar-kameez

312
00:37:56,500 --> 00:38:04,032
She looks great!
- Lovely little sister... sit

313
00:38:04,609 --> 00:38:11,640
How about doing something for me?
- Want to meet Nisha? Say it

314
00:38:16,254 --> 00:38:19,519
When is she going to come?

315
00:38:23,194 --> 00:38:25,253
Hi Nisha! Come, sit

316
00:38:28,699 --> 00:38:31,964
You're looking great

317
00:38:32,503 --> 00:38:35,597
All credits to you

318
00:38:37,241 --> 00:38:41,644
At least I've had an effect on you!
Even the same-same colour

319
00:38:42,179 --> 00:38:46,912
I'd like to come to the point.
Nisha, I want to marry you

320
00:38:47,451 --> 00:38:53,151
I've changed. I don't want
to let my past shadow my future

321
00:38:53,424 --> 00:38:58,054
Great! Past is best forgotten.
- That's what I want to tell you

322
00:38:58,696 --> 00:39:04,498
You belong to my past. So I'd like
to forget things like you

323
00:39:05,036 --> 00:39:08,494
I'm no "thing".
- Oh Ajay! You don't understand

324
00:39:12,310 --> 00:39:14,744
Now I can find a better boy
for myself

325
00:39:20,751 --> 00:39:23,618
What if I find someone else?
- Willing to lose anything

326
00:39:27,091 --> 00:39:28,490
Him

327
00:39:30,294 --> 00:39:31,454
Him...?

328
00:39:31,962 --> 00:39:35,898
He won't even talk to you!
The girls are all over him

329
00:39:41,672 --> 00:39:43,731
See...?
- Right over here...?

330
00:39:49,246 --> 00:39:50,838
Shall we be friends?

331
00:39:55,152 --> 00:39:59,282
Has she gone mad?

332
00:40:00,825 --> 00:40:07,025
Ajay takes girl out, speaks his mind.
Girl goes out with Ajay...

333
00:40:07,331 --> 00:40:11,563
talks her heart to someone else,
and makes a jilted lover out of him

334
00:40:12,670 --> 00:40:17,073
Can't woo a girl! How can he manage
such a big company?

335
00:40:17,308 --> 00:40:21,642
Does my son know
what experience means?

336
00:40:21,946 --> 00:40:26,440
Takes time to grow that hair.
- Then you find it has greyed already!

337
00:40:27,084 --> 00:40:32,078
A perfect solution! Just set up
an "Institute for Reforming Girls"

338
00:40:32,390 --> 00:40:36,451
Girls will come to be reformed. Then
they will walk away with someone else

339
00:40:37,528 --> 00:40:41,931
Enough of jokes at my expense

340
00:40:42,299 --> 00:40:46,326
Ajay Kapoor knows only how to win

341
00:40:47,104 --> 00:40:53,600
Priya, do you have her numbers?
- She has! They keep chatting

342
00:40:53,944 --> 00:40:56,174
Rani, don't interfere

343
00:40:56,514 --> 00:41:03,044
I have her number. Let me dial her up.
- Fast

344
00:41:03,387 --> 00:41:05,150
But you got to do your talking

345
00:41:09,860 --> 00:41:12,294
Go on Ajay.
- I'd like to see you

346
00:41:12,563 --> 00:41:16,556
Consider this urgent.
- No time tomorrow

347
00:41:16,867 --> 00:41:21,463
I'm out picnicking with Sunil.
- Any place in particular?

348
00:41:21,839 --> 00:41:25,434
I'll tell you, provided
you don't disturb me

349
00:41:31,816 --> 00:41:33,841
What happened?

350
00:41:34,318 --> 00:41:36,946
She's going to dreamworld
with some actor, Sunil

351
00:41:41,392 --> 00:41:44,828
But I'm going there.
- To do what? Guess...?

352
00:41:45,129 --> 00:41:46,824
What...?
- He'll play marbles

353
00:41:47,198 --> 00:41:54,661
I can woo girls, I can run companies.
I'll prove that to you

354
00:41:54,939 --> 00:41:58,670
Bravo son! But I'm coming too.
- What will you do there, Ma?

355
00:41:58,909 --> 00:42:04,211
No picnic without me!
- If you go, I go too

356
00:42:04,448 --> 00:42:08,475
Me too!
- Me too

357
00:42:09,620 --> 00:42:12,418
No one is going anywhere

358
00:42:14,925 --> 00:42:17,860
All of us are going for a picnic

359
00:42:20,130 --> 00:42:25,534
Here we are, Dreamworld.
Now declare your war for love

360
00:42:25,836 --> 00:42:31,399
You're looking the wrong way.
Look, how your dove is necking away

361
00:42:35,045 --> 00:42:41,917
Sally forth, like a brave!
Slap him twice, take his place

362
00:42:46,924 --> 00:42:50,018
I'd like to talk to Nisha

363
00:42:50,327 --> 00:42:54,354
Yes go on Ajay.
- So you see Nisha...

364
00:42:54,632 --> 00:42:58,363
even the hues of our lives match!
What I mean to say is...

365
00:42:58,602 --> 00:43:02,197
you won't find anyone better than me.
- Such vanity...?

366
00:43:02,573 --> 00:43:07,101
Please marry me.
- Stubborn too

367
00:43:07,378 --> 00:43:12,111
Nisha, try to understand!
- Has a temper too

368
00:43:12,383 --> 00:43:17,411
What am I lacking in? I've everything!
Houses, cars, money! Everything

369
00:43:17,721 --> 00:43:24,923
Flaunts his Dad's money?
- Ajay, all my bad habits!

370
00:43:26,730 --> 00:43:29,062
You've inculcated all of them.
Please change yourself

371
00:43:29,333 --> 00:43:30,595
Else, no girl is ever
going to like you

372
00:43:35,706 --> 00:43:37,503
We're having a small picnic

373
00:43:40,911 --> 00:43:44,472
This is going to be real fun!

374
00:43:45,316 --> 00:43:52,552
This Vijay! My son has a heartburn!
And he's bringing her right over!

375
00:43:53,090 --> 00:43:59,654
Ajay must win Nisha's heart. Else,
her heart will stay with that Sunil...

376
00:43:59,897 --> 00:44:01,956
even after she has married Ajay!
- Shut up

377
00:44:02,266 --> 00:44:05,633
What use such a marriage?
You'd rather weep and get over it now

378
00:44:13,777 --> 00:44:18,874
You think my nephew can't live without
her? No way! Come, let's square her

379
00:44:19,750 --> 00:44:26,087
How much more am I to eat?
I'm bursting at my seams

380
00:44:28,892 --> 00:44:34,296
Listen, we're playing a game.
- Funtastic! Cricket, football

381
00:44:38,969 --> 00:44:45,033
Gentlemen here will flatter
the women they love

382
00:44:45,275 --> 00:44:49,644
Yes, we're always finding faults with
our ladies. Who ever flatters them?

383
00:44:49,847 --> 00:44:54,250
Token of appreciation
from the lady will be a kiss

384
00:44:57,087 --> 00:44:59,180
Silence, silence! Let's play.
- I begin

385
00:44:59,356 --> 00:45:05,818
Tresses as black as a buffalo's!
- Shut up, Laddoo. Mr. Vijay first

386
00:45:12,569 --> 00:45:16,403
I behold in her poetry personified

387
00:45:16,707 --> 00:45:20,609
She's flirtatious, whimsical,
she enlivens

388
00:45:20,978 --> 00:45:23,913
Without her, my evening are empty

389
00:45:27,785 --> 00:45:32,449
She is my life, my hope, my desires

390
00:45:32,723 --> 00:45:35,954
The keeper of my secrets,
she is my very heartbeat

391
00:45:36,160 --> 00:45:38,993
She is the smile on my lips,
a mother, a lover...

392
00:45:39,263 --> 00:45:43,199
from her flows forth
every relationship...

393
00:45:43,400 --> 00:45:46,062
she is the fountainhead

394
00:45:48,972 --> 00:45:52,203
The lady ought to give a kiss

395
00:45:58,415 --> 00:46:00,178
All right

396
00:46:13,363 --> 00:46:18,460
I flatter you and the mirror gets
the kiss? What do I do with that?

397
00:46:18,869 --> 00:46:22,066
Please, my turn now. My turn!
- Go ahead

398
00:46:22,306 --> 00:46:25,002
First I'll flatter Sweety. In return,
she will give me a sweet, sweet...

399
00:46:25,242 --> 00:46:29,645
Flattery first.
- To that bracelet on your arm...

400
00:46:29,813 --> 00:46:33,579
my heart is stuck.
- To her bracelet? Brilliant

401
00:46:33,917 --> 00:46:36,283
Don't shake that arm,
it'll break my heart

402
00:46:37,755 --> 00:46:43,125
Watch that heart, wear my bracelet.
- Give me a kiss

403
00:46:43,494 --> 00:46:46,691
Why should I? You were flattering
the bracelet

404
00:46:46,964 --> 00:46:51,765
Lucky for you, you didn't
flatter her slippers

405
00:46:53,670 --> 00:46:59,040
Mr. Sunil, whom will you flatter?
- Nisha

406
00:46:59,877 --> 00:47:02,846
And Ajay, you...?
- Of course, Nisha

407
00:47:05,849 --> 00:47:08,716
Winner takes my heart

408
00:47:09,253 --> 00:47:10,982
Get started. Let's decide right away

409
00:47:14,758 --> 00:47:17,022
"Your eyes, like lakes"

410
00:47:17,294 --> 00:47:19,762
"In you, the magic of fountains"

411
00:47:20,063 --> 00:47:21,860
"One look at you..."

412
00:47:22,065 --> 00:47:24,829
"and I am restless"

413
00:47:25,402 --> 00:47:29,839
"There are those who talk of
lakes, fountains and love"

414
00:47:30,107 --> 00:47:32,575
"I call you my goddess of love"

415
00:47:33,043 --> 00:47:35,534
"Gods will bow before this beauty"

416
00:47:36,013 --> 00:47:41,041
"Before my love, no one can stand"

417
00:47:46,323 --> 00:47:51,022
"This is no love"

418
00:47:51,662 --> 00:47:54,426
"The fellow-traveller
isn't the lover"

419
00:47:54,865 --> 00:48:00,804
"Those in love tread upon thorns
and brave the fires"

420
00:48:01,238 --> 00:48:06,301
"Oh why do you not trust my love?
Were it not for true love..."

421
00:48:06,577 --> 00:48:11,105
"this world would never be"

422
00:48:11,815 --> 00:48:16,684
This is too bad Nisha

423
00:48:20,657 --> 00:48:23,990
The contest isn't over yet.
If Ajay can do what I can...

424
00:48:24,127 --> 00:48:29,292
he wins.
- I can do whatever you do

425
00:48:29,399 --> 00:48:32,732
You want me to show you?
- Go on

426
00:48:37,207 --> 00:48:41,507
Think it over.
- Done

427
00:48:53,891 --> 00:48:57,088
Nice act

428
00:49:13,877 --> 00:49:18,280
"The winds, the clouds are saying
what a wonderful sight this is"

429
00:49:18,582 --> 00:49:23,485
"But only a heart will ever know
what a heart has to say"

430
00:49:23,720 --> 00:49:28,180
"The winds, the clouds are saying
what a wonderful sight this is"

431
00:49:28,458 --> 00:49:32,554
"But only a heart will ever know
what a heart has to say"

432
00:49:32,763 --> 00:49:52,674
"Love calls out to love,
oh so lovingly"

433
00:49:53,550 --> 00:49:58,419
"When my eyes met loving eyes,
I fell in love"

434
00:49:58,522 --> 00:50:02,515
"But only a heart will ever know
what a heart has to say"

435
00:50:02,693 --> 00:50:13,365
"When my eyes met loving eyes,
I fell in love"

436
00:50:23,580 --> 00:50:32,420
"When I saw the pining,
I wished I'd die for love"

437
00:50:33,523 --> 00:50:37,892
"In my lover's arms,
my love will be requited"

438
00:50:38,128 --> 00:50:42,428
"In love's embrace,
even love loses itself"

439
00:50:42,833 --> 00:50:44,960
"My love..."

440
00:50:45,268 --> 00:50:52,697
"you are the one I aspire for"

441
00:50:53,210 --> 00:50:57,772
"Your youthfulness has swept me
off my feet"

442
00:50:58,015 --> 00:51:02,008
"Oh how I've spent all these moments
without you"

443
00:51:02,352 --> 00:51:11,988
"Love calls out for love,
oh so lovingly"

444
00:51:44,861 --> 00:51:49,321
"With love, let me etch my name
in your heart. It's Love"

445
00:51:49,966 --> 00:51:54,335
"Nothing's greater than love,
all I want to do is make love"

446
00:51:54,905 --> 00:51:59,035
"Look at love, ask for love,
with love"

447
00:51:59,843 --> 00:52:04,303
"If love ever deserts me,
speak to me of love"

448
00:52:04,581 --> 00:52:10,884
"This promise,
let never be broken..."

449
00:52:11,321 --> 00:52:14,154
"let us never part"

450
00:52:14,758 --> 00:52:19,286
"Your love I treasure
more than my life"

451
00:52:19,529 --> 00:52:23,693
"You, I hold in my heart"

452
00:52:23,967 --> 00:52:44,082
"Love calls out for love,
oh so lovingly"

453
00:52:44,554 --> 00:52:49,014
"The winds, the clouds are saying
what a wonderful sight this is"

454
00:52:49,459 --> 00:52:53,623
"But only a heart will ever know
what a heart has to say"

455
00:52:53,864 --> 00:52:56,094
"Love calls out..."

456
00:52:56,299 --> 00:52:58,699
"To love...

457
00:52:58,869 --> 00:53:01,201
"oh so lovingly"

458
00:53:01,304 --> 00:53:05,001
"With love"

459
00:54:13,877 --> 00:54:18,780
Pack up.
- Hey who are you to order us around?

460
00:54:18,982 --> 00:54:22,145
Cut out the informality.
- You bloody...

461
00:54:22,285 --> 00:54:26,517
Hari Singh! One minute!
Ajay, please! Let me talk

462
00:54:27,190 --> 00:54:30,284
Hari Singh, what's this attitude?
He's the boss' son

463
00:54:30,460 --> 00:54:34,157
At home, maybe. Here, he's a worker.
And I'm his senior

464
00:54:34,464 --> 00:54:38,992
True, but the sight of gambling in
the premises can rouse tempers, no?

465
00:54:39,202 --> 00:54:44,572
Let him complain to the supervisor.
I'll do what my supervisor tells me

466
00:54:45,008 --> 00:54:48,774
Times when we'd bow like slaves before
the King-in-waiting are gone

467
00:54:48,878 --> 00:54:53,611
No, that's not the case...
- Idler! I'll break your face

468
00:54:53,683 --> 00:54:57,312
You don't know who I am!
- What are you waiting for?

469
00:54:57,554 --> 00:54:59,215
Come on, break my face!
- One minute! Ajay please

470
00:54:59,389 --> 00:55:05,021
Hari Singh, just forget this.
- This isn't going to be forgotten

471
00:55:05,595 --> 00:55:08,564
This is going to be decided.
Here and now! And you stay out

472
00:55:09,099 --> 00:55:13,035
You stay out! Get that?
- I won't budge an inch

473
00:55:13,270 --> 00:55:16,967
Because you're the union leader, you
expect everyone to lick your boots?

474
00:55:17,107 --> 00:55:20,668
Hey son-in-law-about-the-house!
You think you own this factory?

475
00:55:39,195 --> 00:55:42,392
Let go of him!
You're going to kill him

476
00:55:42,599 --> 00:55:45,830
Ajay! Stop! Please!

477
00:56:07,190 --> 00:56:10,887
No getting away with this!
- Ajay, listen to me

478
00:56:52,836 --> 00:56:56,567
I'll put an end to this leadership!
Booze and gambling!

479
00:56:56,773 --> 00:57:00,436
You're going to kill him!
- It's over! Once and for all! Let go

480
00:57:00,577 --> 00:57:02,442
He won't ever touch anyone

481
00:57:02,612 --> 00:57:05,877
What does he think of himself?
He can do whatever he wants?

482
00:57:07,784 --> 00:57:11,652
I sent you to the factory to learn.
Not to teach anyone

483
00:57:12,222 --> 00:57:17,159
Workers are paid to work,
not to gamble

484
00:57:17,394 --> 00:57:21,763
Your principle, maybe. But you
have no right to impose yourself

485
00:57:22,432 --> 00:57:26,232
Then why just four of them?
Tell all the workers to gamble

486
00:57:37,514 --> 00:57:43,646
Those four hold 4000 at ransom.
Workers are brainwashed into...

487
00:57:43,853 --> 00:57:48,722
thinking that if anyone
is concerned with or capable of...

488
00:57:48,925 --> 00:57:52,656
ensuring their welfare, it's the only
the unionists. But the truth is...

489
00:57:52,862 --> 00:57:58,323
these unions have contributed to
nothing but poverty, hunger, larceny

490
00:58:00,303 --> 00:58:10,008
Ever seen the sheep being herded
by four dogs?

491
00:58:10,947 --> 00:58:17,113
They Mr. Ajay Kapoor, are our ones

492
00:58:17,353 --> 00:58:24,452
Meaning, you knew everything?
- Yes. And though I'm in the know...

493
00:58:24,627 --> 00:58:28,063
I have to pretend ignorance

494
00:58:29,866 --> 00:58:33,461
Not in 25 years, have workers ever
gone on strike in this factory

495
00:58:33,670 --> 00:58:37,197
Reason wherefor is the way
I use the union

496
00:58:38,475 --> 00:58:43,208
Hari Singh assaulted Rajesh,
but he didn't retaliate

497
00:58:43,379 --> 00:58:47,907
Because he knows it's not in the
interests of the factory. But you?

498
00:58:48,117 --> 00:58:51,450
The vigour of your youth
makes you oblivious?

499
00:58:59,362 --> 00:59:01,830
Look Ajay...

500
00:59:02,298 --> 00:59:08,635
I don't wish to be a subject of
ridicule for the business community

501
00:59:08,771 --> 00:59:14,607
I want you to apologise
to that union leader right now

502
00:59:21,551 --> 00:59:22,643
Okay, Papa

503
00:59:24,053 --> 00:59:27,318
For the sake of the workers,
Hari Singh can take a beating

504
00:59:27,423 --> 00:59:30,358
But betray the workers,
I never will

505
00:59:31,628 --> 00:59:34,096
We aren't slaves, are we?

506
00:59:38,902 --> 00:59:43,839
He said something in English?
But English, I don't know

507
00:59:43,973 --> 00:59:47,238
Had I known English, would I be
a worker? I'd be a manager

508
00:59:47,911 --> 00:59:54,942
For our sakes, let's hear you speak
in Hindi whatever you said in English

509
00:59:55,151 --> 00:59:58,643
Go on, are you shy?

510
00:59:58,788 --> 01:00:01,723
Forgive me

511
01:00:02,258 --> 01:00:05,785
What did he say?
Anyone heard that?

512
01:00:06,563 --> 01:00:11,262
But only yesterday, you ripped
the shirt off my back in public

513
01:00:11,534 --> 01:00:19,339
You stripped me. Now King-in-waiting
speaks in hushed tones? Speak up

514
01:00:19,542 --> 01:00:23,740
Come on, say it. In public

515
01:00:24,147 --> 01:00:29,016
Yesterday...

516
01:00:30,186 --> 01:00:33,019
I assaulted him

517
01:00:34,290 --> 01:00:38,056
It was my mistake

518
01:00:39,095 --> 01:00:48,561
Therefore, I beg his forgiveness

519
01:00:50,673 --> 01:01:00,378
For the first time in my life, I've
bowed before a man who has wronged

520
01:01:02,085 --> 01:01:07,148
Because you told me.
- You shouldn't regret apologising...

521
01:01:07,290 --> 01:01:13,593
for what was your mistake.
- But I can't bring myself...

522
01:01:13,730 --> 01:01:17,757
to bear the pain I am suffering
...the rage within. Accepted...

523
01:01:21,371 --> 01:01:26,502
your experience count more than mine.
But the way you think differs...

524
01:01:26,843 --> 01:01:32,406
entirely from the way I perceive
things. A difference of a generation

525
01:01:34,450 --> 01:01:40,821
So I have decided to start up
the IT business on my own

526
01:01:41,591 --> 01:01:50,932
The business I want to get into, needs
no experience. Education is enough

527
01:02:02,445 --> 01:02:07,883
Do you have the capability
of managing a company?

528
01:02:08,117 --> 01:02:13,851
Look son... you don't learn swimming
sitting ashore

529
01:02:14,090 --> 01:02:17,218
Without knowledge of good and bad,
rights, wrongs in business context...

530
01:02:17,560 --> 01:02:21,326
you can't get into business.
You'll end up ruining your company

531
01:02:21,497 --> 01:02:25,900
In the IT business,
you don't need packdogs

532
01:02:27,170 --> 01:02:31,197
It takes educated, capable people.
- Do you imply that...

533
01:02:31,407 --> 01:02:34,808
ones who are educated, capable,
do not deal with unions?

534
01:02:34,977 --> 01:02:39,846
Big-time politicians are involved!
- The American solution is hire-n-fire

535
01:02:40,016 --> 01:02:44,953
No, that'd be oppressing your workers.
- What about what I was forced to do?

536
01:02:45,354 --> 01:02:56,060
You do not see that? Papa, you want
to use the union to control workers

537
01:02:56,232 --> 01:03:02,660
I want the remote control in my hands.
Between you and I...

538
01:03:02,905 --> 01:03:08,673
maybe, therein lies the difference.
- Not differences, son

539
01:03:08,845 --> 01:03:16,013
Differing points of view. I think
experience is more necessary

540
01:03:16,185 --> 01:03:21,213
For you, education is more important.
These views aren't reconcilable

541
01:03:21,824 --> 01:03:27,922
They never were, they never will be.
- Meaning whereby...

542
01:03:28,064 --> 01:03:32,398
that I cannot expect you
to support my venture?

543
01:03:41,778 --> 01:03:44,474
Brother-in-law! Where are you?

544
01:03:44,914 --> 01:03:51,717
We've been disgraced! Ruined!
- He's very busy

545
01:03:51,921 --> 01:03:54,981
What is the matter? Tell me.
- Ajay has disgraced us

546
01:03:55,491 --> 01:03:58,483
Read this paper! Everyone in
the market is laughing at us

547
01:03:58,628 --> 01:04:04,931
Don't let him hear this.
- What's this hue-and-cry?

548
01:04:05,134 --> 01:04:07,159
For the sake of the family!
- What is the matter?

549
01:04:07,303 --> 01:04:11,603
What's left to be said?
Read this

550
01:04:11,774 --> 01:04:14,572
Look at what Ajay has done

551
01:04:22,518 --> 01:04:29,356
Borrowing from the market?

552
01:04:37,400 --> 01:04:47,071
What's all this? How much do you need?
Ten million? 20...? 50...? 1 00...?

553
01:04:47,510 --> 01:04:51,139
More? Want a billion?
Just fill in this cheque

554
01:04:52,381 --> 01:04:55,248
But never again make the mistake
of borrowing from the market

555
01:04:55,418 --> 01:05:00,754
You're financing me to protect
your reputation on the markets

556
01:05:02,058 --> 01:05:10,227
More than your son, you care for your
prestige? That's what you care more

557
01:05:13,769 --> 01:05:25,510
I'll never accept what's given
in contempt. Take that cheque back

558
01:05:35,558 --> 01:05:43,988
Your father's name, you have already
maligned. Go, pawn my name if you will

559
01:05:52,642 --> 01:05:57,511
Ajay, he's hurt very deeply.
I'm telling you all this...

560
01:05:57,680 --> 01:06:01,582
because I'm your elder in years.
Take what he's giving you, please

561
01:06:12,828 --> 01:06:20,928
Just let me liquidate your loans.
What's wrong with us investing?

562
01:06:24,073 --> 01:06:32,538
This investment is free of interest.
You bring home all your profits

563
01:06:32,782 --> 01:06:36,912
And outsiders don't have a say.
- Rajesh, enough

564
01:06:37,086 --> 01:06:39,213
Leave me alone

565
01:06:39,422 --> 01:06:43,188
Ajay, I'm not leaving you all alone.
Just listen to your father

566
01:06:48,531 --> 01:06:52,092
Go away

567
01:07:03,813 --> 01:07:11,219
What's up? Going somewhere?
- We're leaving this house

568
01:07:13,622 --> 01:07:15,522
Why...?

569
01:07:16,592 --> 01:07:21,962
I don't wish to be a burden on ones
who have no respect for my husband

570
01:07:23,599 --> 01:07:28,901
I'll make do with whatever
my husband can provide for me

571
01:07:29,171 --> 01:07:37,408
I prefer hardship to life lived
in disgrace. Your teachings, no?

572
01:07:37,847 --> 01:07:42,409
But who misbehaved with your husband?
- Preeti, say no more

573
01:07:42,752 --> 01:07:47,280
You must tell me the truth!
What's going on?

574
01:07:49,959 --> 01:07:53,053
Ajay has ordered him
out of the house

575
01:08:03,472 --> 01:08:07,101
What happened?
- Today, no one interferes

576
01:08:07,977 --> 01:08:14,007
I'm still alive, Ajay. I still breathe!
Who gave you the right...

577
01:08:14,183 --> 01:08:17,880
to tell Rajesh to leave this house?
- I didn't ask him to leave

578
01:08:18,154 --> 01:08:24,753
I only asked him to leave me alone.
- You should have the guts to own up

579
01:08:24,960 --> 01:08:27,451
It's fear of your father
that makes you lie

580
01:08:27,963 --> 01:08:31,729
Papa, I revere you.
I'm not afraid of you

581
01:08:32,068 --> 01:08:36,903
Yes, I see that you have begun
to suspect my truths

582
01:08:37,373 --> 01:08:44,302
Are you so frustrated that you try
to make a lie sound like the truth?

583
01:08:44,547 --> 01:08:49,484
And because you cannot take it out
on me, you unleash yourself on Rajesh?

584
01:08:49,652 --> 01:08:53,281
If you think I'm frustrated with life,
you are completely mistaken, Papa

585
01:08:54,690 --> 01:09:00,560
I'm educated, I can seek solutions to
every problem. Frustrated, I won't be

586
01:09:00,696 --> 01:09:03,256
Trust me.
- This confidence in yourself...

587
01:09:03,499 --> 01:09:09,563
is misplaced. You think these loans
you raise were given to you...

588
01:09:09,738 --> 01:09:16,041
because of your capabilities? Wrong!
In the market...

589
01:09:16,245 --> 01:09:20,579
not even the unknown beggar is given
alms. And you are known to be...

590
01:09:20,749 --> 01:09:27,814
Vijay Kapoor's son. Because of this
singular virtue the markets lend you...

591
01:09:29,625 --> 01:09:33,994
knowing, that even if you cannot
pay interests...

592
01:09:34,230 --> 01:09:38,997
Vijay Kapoor will go to the extent of
selling himself to pay back every cent

593
01:09:42,004 --> 01:09:50,139
Papa, why are you so arrogant?
What makes you think that...

594
01:09:50,312 --> 01:09:53,770
even the air I breathe
is thanks only to you?

595
01:09:55,918 --> 01:09:58,113
Look son...

596
01:10:00,689 --> 01:10:07,094
once the son has grown up, he takes
his father's pride to be vanity

597
01:10:09,365 --> 01:10:11,765
And the father...

598
01:10:14,170 --> 01:10:18,129
the father pities his son
for his inexperience

599
01:10:20,776 --> 01:10:26,715
I don't need certificates from
my family to prove my knowledge

600
01:10:29,018 --> 01:10:33,955
Once differences in perceptions have
cropped up between the generations...

601
01:10:34,190 --> 01:10:39,753
the two should go their separate ways.
- You tread your path at your own risk

602
01:10:40,162 --> 01:10:44,929
I shall... I shall leave.
I surely will

603
01:10:45,201 --> 01:10:50,036
Ajay, I'm the root cause of all
the trouble. Please, say no more

604
01:10:50,206 --> 01:10:54,267
Let him speak, Rajesh.
He has forgotten decorum

605
01:10:54,710 --> 01:11:00,148
You force me to speak.
- As I forced you to borrow?

606
01:11:00,716 --> 01:11:06,882
After you refused me, I had no way out.
Maybe you doubt my capabilities

607
01:11:08,424 --> 01:11:14,056
In that case, would I have sent
you abroad for studies?

608
01:11:15,197 --> 01:11:21,261
Would I have given you this lifestyle?
Would I have left the company...

609
01:11:21,503 --> 01:11:29,740
in your hands? And you tell me, that
I doubt your capabilities? Ingrate

610
01:11:32,081 --> 01:11:37,678
Papa, are you reminding me
of all you have done for me?

611
01:11:48,831 --> 01:11:56,499
How could you think... a father would
remind his son what he did for him?

612
01:12:02,645 --> 01:12:05,808
Sir, you mean...?
- Ajay, please say no more!

613
01:12:14,990 --> 01:12:18,585
Rajesh, I didn't mean to push you

614
01:12:19,094 --> 01:12:21,562
Listen...

615
01:12:22,498 --> 01:12:32,134
Please, don't get worked up.
All this was unintentional

616
01:12:32,608 --> 01:12:38,945
Ajay didn't push purposely.
I know my son very well

617
01:12:39,948 --> 01:12:43,907
Such a mistake, he'd never do

618
01:12:46,021 --> 01:12:56,124
Pratima, that shove was meant for me,
not for Rajesh. Directed at me

619
01:12:58,100 --> 01:13:05,165
This house is mine. In this house,
my every spoken word is the law

620
01:13:05,974 --> 01:13:10,172
I am ordering Ajay
to leave this house

621
01:13:23,258 --> 01:13:26,785
Ajay, what are you doing?

622
01:13:26,995 --> 01:13:32,865
Must you take to heart your
father's word spoken in anger?

623
01:13:34,303 --> 01:13:43,211
Didn't you hear what Papa said?
Here in this house of his...

624
01:13:43,379 --> 01:13:50,581
his spoken word is the law.
The law-breaker is a criminal

625
01:13:51,620 --> 01:13:55,283
In your eyes, a criminal I will not be.
- Don't go away

626
01:13:55,424 --> 01:13:57,551
Nor will I be my father's criminal

627
01:13:57,793 --> 01:14:00,318
Please! Don't go away

628
01:14:00,596 --> 01:14:03,963
Ajay, please! Stop

629
01:14:04,233 --> 01:14:09,865
Let him go. Father and son are like
water-drops separated this moment...

630
01:14:10,072 --> 01:14:14,304
flowing together tomorrow

631
01:14:27,623 --> 01:14:33,755
You I have loved, not your status,
nor your family

632
01:14:34,863 --> 01:14:38,993
Come with me. Take a word of advice
from my Daddy

633
01:14:43,205 --> 01:14:48,302
No, I can never let my daughter
marry a man who has been...

634
01:14:48,544 --> 01:14:54,744
disowned by his family.
- Disowned I may be

635
01:14:54,983 --> 01:14:59,010
But I will leave nothing wanting
for the family I will raise

636
01:14:59,221 --> 01:15:05,888
No! I'll have nothing to do with you,
nor will I let my daughter marry you

637
01:15:06,094 --> 01:15:08,358
You may leave

638
01:15:24,346 --> 01:15:29,147
Your every decision I have respected
and abided by. When I took...

639
01:15:29,384 --> 01:15:37,553
the most important decision of my life,
I expected your acquiescence. But...

640
01:15:37,793 --> 01:15:43,390
you've insulted the man I love.
And this I cannot tolerate

641
01:15:45,934 --> 01:15:57,539
I shall never forgive you
for not giving me away

642
01:16:08,257 --> 01:16:17,131
"Shattered I am, but
I will always love you..."

643
01:16:17,766 --> 01:16:26,196
"and leave you, never"

644
01:16:27,543 --> 01:16:33,106
"I swear by my love"

645
01:16:36,518 --> 01:16:43,481
"I will fulfill my vows"

646
01:16:44,159 --> 01:16:51,793
"The eyes that look up at you
with love..."

647
01:16:52,000 --> 01:17:03,309
"the heart that warms to you..."

648
01:17:03,445 --> 01:17:15,380
"is filled with love"

649
01:17:17,459 --> 01:17:25,093
"The eyes that look up at you
with love..."

650
01:17:25,300 --> 01:17:28,963
"the heart that warms to you..."

651
01:17:29,137 --> 01:17:36,441
"is filled with love"

652
01:17:39,414 --> 01:17:50,257
"It's my heart"

653
01:18:13,215 --> 01:18:18,482
"For your sake, I have left
everything behind"

654
01:18:18,720 --> 01:18:24,090
"I have broken all bonds,
every tradition"

655
01:18:24,326 --> 01:18:29,263
"Let me open my eyes only
to gaze at this beauty"

656
01:18:29,698 --> 01:18:34,795
"Let breathe only
to feel her breath"

657
01:18:34,970 --> 01:18:40,340
"The one who has drowned
in your love..."

658
01:18:40,509 --> 01:18:44,969
"the one who seeks you within..."

659
01:18:46,014 --> 01:18:55,821
"is a heart"

660
01:18:56,758 --> 01:19:07,100
"It's my heart"

661
01:19:31,059 --> 01:19:35,996
"I'll reach out to the stars for you"

662
01:19:36,198 --> 01:19:41,636
"My wild lover, all my life,
I will be yours"

663
01:19:41,837 --> 01:19:46,900
"In your arms,
I have forgotten all else"

664
01:19:47,109 --> 01:19:52,376
"In your love,
I have found everything"

665
01:19:52,547 --> 01:19:57,246
"The one in your dreams..."

666
01:19:57,486 --> 01:20:02,617
"yours for a lifetime..."

667
01:20:04,092 --> 01:20:13,194
"is a heart"

668
01:20:14,302 --> 01:20:23,233
"It's my heart"

669
01:20:25,413 --> 01:20:32,842
"The eyes that look up at you
with love..."

670
01:20:33,155 --> 01:20:37,057
"The heart that warms to you..."

671
01:20:37,159 --> 01:20:45,089
"Is filled with love"

672
01:20:47,536 --> 01:20:58,435
"It's my heart"

673
01:21:17,399 --> 01:21:23,065
You haven't been to the office
for quite sometime now

674
01:21:23,305 --> 01:21:28,572
A lot of work is pending. So I brought
the papers for your signature

675
01:21:30,111 --> 01:21:35,481
Rajesh, I haven't been keeping
too well

676
01:21:36,785 --> 01:21:43,850
Priya's wedding is coming up shortly,
got to take care of the wedding too

677
01:21:48,029 --> 01:21:55,800
Sir, you need strong shoulders
for support...

678
01:21:58,139 --> 01:22:02,439
why don't you ask Ajay
to come back?

679
01:22:17,726 --> 01:22:22,425
Priya's wedding has been finalised?
- Yes Ajay. Just come home

680
01:22:22,731 --> 01:22:25,962
Everything will be all right.
So momentous a decision...

681
01:22:26,167 --> 01:22:30,501
and folks at home
never even informed me

682
01:22:31,139 --> 01:22:35,542
Am I so estranged...? You tell me,
am I a stranger?

683
01:22:35,710 --> 01:22:37,940
No Ajay, actually everything
happened so fast

684
01:22:38,380 --> 01:22:43,249
Just come home, and everything will be
all right. Don't take this to heart

685
01:22:43,418 --> 01:22:47,616
Here's the wedding invitation.
Do take a look

686
01:22:55,830 --> 01:23:00,460
Papa hasn't even mentioned
my name on the invitation!

687
01:24:13,408 --> 01:24:15,376
Stop

688
01:24:25,186 --> 01:24:27,620
Brother

689
01:24:34,095 --> 01:24:38,225
My little...

690
01:24:39,701 --> 01:24:44,263
darling

691
01:25:33,555 --> 01:25:35,614
One request, sir

692
01:25:36,157 --> 01:25:39,285
Ever since we married, I have
never taken Preeti for a vacation

693
01:25:39,494 --> 01:25:42,861
She would be happy if I did

694
01:25:45,166 --> 01:25:49,728
Why not, Rajesh? Just let me know
your programme

695
01:25:50,138 --> 01:25:53,699
Actually, we wanted
to leave this evening

696
01:25:53,875 --> 01:25:56,537
But there's a very important
business meeting tomorrow

697
01:25:56,678 --> 01:26:00,808
I you could take of the meeting
that'd be fine

698
01:26:00,882 --> 01:26:04,045
Very well, Rajesh. Go on.
I'll take care of everything

699
01:26:04,652 --> 01:26:09,316
Mr. Kapoor, granted that in Rajesh
you have a very responsible hand...

700
01:26:09,557 --> 01:26:15,757
taking care of your businesses.
But I would rather that...

701
01:26:16,030 --> 01:26:19,625
you sank your differences
and called Ajay back

702
01:26:21,136 --> 01:26:23,001
They are here

703
01:26:35,316 --> 01:26:41,277
Yes, Rajesh was told me about
this business meeting

704
01:26:47,428 --> 01:26:50,329
What's this...?
- A notice, Mr. Kapoor

705
01:26:50,532 --> 01:26:56,368
We're here to collect the 500 million
you borrowed by raising mortgages

706
01:26:56,638 --> 01:27:01,166
You are overdrawn. Worse, your
cheques bouncing one after another...

707
01:27:01,309 --> 01:27:05,712
jeopardises our reputation too.
- Your factories and residences...

708
01:27:05,880 --> 01:27:12,217
are all pledged. Those are the papers.
Liquidation is the only way out now

1
01:27:13,401 --> 01:27:19,001
Such a big deception?
The financial markets are in a tumult

2
01:27:42,034 --> 01:27:44,867
Rajesh

3
01:27:46,639 --> 01:27:51,269
Only aim in my life
was to make it rich

4
01:27:51,478 --> 01:27:54,311
No matter how much I earned,
all I could've afforded...

5
01:27:54,514 --> 01:27:59,076
was a middle-lass existence like
millions others. So I think it over

6
01:27:59,319 --> 01:28:05,918
And I target Mr. Vijay Kapoor.
I win him over, get myself employed

7
01:28:06,159 --> 01:28:11,563
There I come to know that his biggest
weakness is his daughter Preeti

8
01:28:11,764 --> 01:28:15,666
I present myself to Preeti so as to
make her fall in love with me...

9
01:28:15,935 --> 01:28:21,373
the path that leads right into
his home. Mr. Vijay Kapoor wanted...

10
01:28:21,541 --> 01:28:26,478
to give me a car, an apartment,
everything. But I wasn't begging

11
01:28:26,713 --> 01:28:31,707
He takes it for a sacrifice,
and takes me in, like a son

12
01:28:32,318 --> 01:28:36,118
My first victory.
- Now the biggest hurdle in my way...

13
01:28:36,322 --> 01:28:41,658
was Vijay Kapoor's son Ajay. I hear
father and son conversing...

14
01:28:41,861 --> 01:28:46,230
and I realise that their approaches
to life are entirely different

15
01:28:46,666 --> 01:28:53,401
When Vijay Kapoor sent his son to
the factory to learn the ropes...

16
01:28:53,606 --> 01:28:56,200
I played my next card. Hari Singh,
what man will stand by and watch...

17
01:28:56,409 --> 01:28:59,003
his brother-in-law getting bashed up?
- No one

18
01:28:59,179 --> 01:29:02,171
Ajay loses his temper, he beats up
Hari Singh. And this rascal...

19
01:29:02,348 --> 01:29:06,409
he takes it without a whimper.
Then he calls for a strike...

20
01:29:06,619 --> 01:29:14,583
which unsettles Vijay Kapoor so much
that he forces his son to apologise

21
01:29:14,727 --> 01:29:21,860
And the way I did it to him!
It was like a lashing in public

22
01:29:22,936 --> 01:29:27,600
Then what happens? Holy war
between father and son begins

23
01:29:28,041 --> 01:29:32,478
Ajay asks his father to finance
his business, he refuses

24
01:29:32,845 --> 01:29:38,408
In the heat of the moment, Ajay
borrows money on personal bonds

25
01:29:38,651 --> 01:29:42,519
And I publish the news in my paper.
- Mr. Khanna, your news was like...

26
01:29:42,722 --> 01:29:47,682
adding fuel to fire. Yes, Vijay Kapoor
is infuriated, he offers his son...

27
01:29:47,927 --> 01:29:57,268
to name his price to buy him out.
I rub the salt into his wounds

28
01:29:57,537 --> 01:30:04,534
I incite him upto the point when
he asks me to leave him alone

29
01:30:05,245 --> 01:30:11,115
I confront Preeti with the analogy
that I'm no better than a dog...

30
01:30:11,351 --> 01:30:16,755
in her brother's home, in her father's
home. Son is son, dog is dog

31
01:30:17,090 --> 01:30:21,993
I incite Preeti till she decides
to walk out that moment

32
01:30:22,328 --> 01:30:27,994
Mr. Vijay Kapoor was raging already
like a wounded lion. Our departure...

33
01:30:28,268 --> 01:30:34,571
was like a stab in his wound. For one
last time, father and son quarrelled

34
01:30:34,841 --> 01:30:39,403
And unwittingly, Ajay pushes me.
I pretend to stagger and fall

35
01:30:41,614 --> 01:30:49,646
That provokes Vijay Kapoor to throw
his son out. My second victory

36
01:30:49,922 --> 01:30:55,087
Now I wanted to ensure that
father and son re-unite, never

37
01:30:55,428 --> 01:31:01,367
Opportunity arises in Priya's wedding.
I had one wedding invitation printed

38
01:31:01,668 --> 01:31:06,571
One sans Ajay's name.
Then, I seize opportunity when...

39
01:31:06,773 --> 01:31:13,406
Vijay Kapoor is moping over his son.
I got him to sign in my favor...

40
01:31:13,546 --> 01:31:18,882
a power of attorney.
The beginning of ruination

41
01:31:19,185 --> 01:31:23,918
I mortgaged all his factories
and all his estates

42
01:31:24,123 --> 01:31:30,995
For half the market price. Papers
were drawn up for full market value

43
01:31:31,264 --> 01:31:36,361
A relationship made a pauper out of
Vijay Kapoor. And I have used...

44
01:31:36,602 --> 01:31:41,972
my relationship to emerge
a successful businessman

45
01:31:51,150 --> 01:31:56,213
That's my success story

46
01:32:17,610 --> 01:32:19,976
This court hereby permits
Dalal Financiers...

47
01:32:20,179 --> 01:32:28,848
to auction off Mr. Vijay Kapoor's
estates to recover their dues

48
01:32:38,164 --> 01:32:44,467
"Yesterday's truths
are today's legends"

49
01:32:44,637 --> 01:32:51,201
"Homes plundered
brick by brick"

50
01:32:51,711 --> 01:32:57,445
"In moments, friends
become strangers"

51
01:32:58,251 --> 01:33:04,190
"Memories are so dear"

52
01:33:07,693 --> 01:33:16,362
"Ruination, long shadows of sorrow
are all that remain"

53
01:33:16,536 --> 01:33:21,906
"And empty, tearful eyes"

54
01:33:22,341 --> 01:33:27,506
"What's left of life?"

55
01:33:27,713 --> 01:33:35,313
"Oh, what's left of life?"

56
01:34:08,921 --> 01:34:15,520
What will happen now, Ma?

57
01:35:31,704 --> 01:35:38,667
This isn't just a house.
This is Papa's honour

58
01:35:40,913 --> 01:35:45,646
I won't let it go under
the hammer. Never

59
01:36:27,526 --> 01:36:33,897
"Don't punish me for loving you"

60
01:36:34,400 --> 01:36:40,805
"Don't betray my love"

61
01:36:41,407 --> 01:36:44,808
"I'm yours, you're mine"

62
01:36:45,011 --> 01:36:48,276
"You are lost in my eyes"

63
01:36:49,015 --> 01:36:52,542
"Trust me"

64
01:36:53,219 --> 01:36:57,053
"I'm madly in love"

65
01:36:57,256 --> 01:37:08,690
"Madly in love with you"

66
01:37:52,078 --> 01:37:55,309
"I pray for you"

67
01:37:55,614 --> 01:37:58,947
"I desire you"

68
01:37:59,151 --> 01:38:02,746
"I'm in love with you"

69
01:38:02,922 --> 01:38:09,088
"Don't ever stop loving me"

70
01:38:09,929 --> 01:38:13,558
"Promise me"

71
01:38:21,474 --> 01:38:27,344
"Don't make me cry"

72
01:38:28,147 --> 01:38:34,814
"Don't punish me for loving you"

73
01:39:38,851 --> 01:39:42,287
"My heart beats for you"

74
01:39:42,488 --> 01:39:45,252
"My lips speak your name"

75
01:39:45,624 --> 01:39:49,253
"You, I thirst for"

76
01:39:49,528 --> 01:39:56,024
"I don't want to be taken away
from you"

77
01:39:56,669 --> 01:40:00,127
"You are my hope"

78
01:40:08,147 --> 01:40:13,676
"Don't destroy my world"

79
01:40:14,954 --> 01:40:22,156
"Don't punish me for loving you"

80
01:41:12,878 --> 01:41:18,510
Why are you so late Ajay?
I've been worried

81
01:41:18,951 --> 01:41:21,215
I had been home

82
01:41:22,054 --> 01:41:24,989
What home...?
- My home

83
01:41:25,157 --> 01:41:27,523
To Mummy-Papa

84
01:41:31,263 --> 01:41:39,432
And I...? You took such a big
decision all by yourself?

85
01:41:39,939 --> 01:41:46,469
I need no one's permission
to go home

86
01:41:47,079 --> 01:41:53,109
Where were they, when you
were being thrown out?

87
01:41:54,019 --> 01:41:57,955
Where were they, when you
were devastated deep down inside...

88
01:41:58,190 --> 01:42:03,890
when you needed someone to take care
of you? Tell me Ajay. Then...

89
01:42:04,129 --> 01:42:09,396
no one came by to even care! What is
this sudden surge of sentiment?

90
01:42:11,303 --> 01:42:19,733
They are worse off than I am.
My Papa is sick

91
01:42:20,479 --> 01:42:26,543
His factories, his residence
is going under the hammer

92
01:42:27,052 --> 01:42:35,824
In that state, I can never desert him.
That's my religion, that's my duty

93
01:42:36,562 --> 01:42:43,730
Your every loyalty begins and ends
with me. When they deserted you...

94
01:42:44,103 --> 01:42:49,666
I was the only one who stood by you.
I too had my Daddy

95
01:42:50,142 --> 01:42:56,513
Towards him, I had my loyalties too.
But for love's sake...

96
01:42:56,815 --> 01:43:06,053
I spurned everything, to be with you.
And today, in this condition...

97
01:43:06,358 --> 01:43:14,493
when it's you whom I need the most,
you want to leave me?

98
01:43:14,933 --> 01:43:21,031
Who wants to leave you? I have never
stayed away from you. Nor can I ever

99
01:43:21,874 --> 01:43:27,642
You are a part of our family

100
01:43:28,947 --> 01:43:34,408
They will love you. They never
dismissed you as a stranger

101
01:43:34,586 --> 01:43:43,016
Why should you estrange yourself?
- With you, I've vowed to stand...

102
01:43:43,295 --> 01:43:48,028
in joy and in sorrow. But partaking
only a portion of your love...

103
01:43:48,200 --> 01:43:52,398
is not acceptable to me

104
01:44:12,958 --> 01:44:15,756
Where are you going?

105
01:44:19,364 --> 01:44:24,825
Listen... listen to me Ajay!
Don't leave me today

106
01:44:25,037 --> 01:44:27,562
I must go

107
01:44:31,043 --> 01:44:34,479
If that's the imperative,
then at this moment...

108
01:44:34,746 --> 01:44:40,946
you will decide whether to cast
your lot with your parents or with me

109
01:44:45,157 --> 01:44:50,390
For the sake of our relationship,
you want to break other relationships?

110
01:44:54,933 --> 01:45:04,604
Nisha, it's your wish. To stand by me,
or not, the decision is in your hands

111
01:45:13,752 --> 01:45:22,717
Daddy, take me away from here

112
01:45:27,366 --> 01:45:30,824
Ma, how are you?

113
01:45:42,381 --> 01:45:44,406
Where's Nisha? You didn't
bring her along?

114
01:45:44,583 --> 01:45:49,111
Ma, you're about to become a grandma.
So I left her in her father's care

115
01:45:50,155 --> 01:45:55,559
Such good news!
And you didn't inform us...?

116
01:45:59,398 --> 01:46:02,492
Pratima, I need no one's sympathy,
no one's charity

117
01:46:02,668 --> 01:46:05,000
Vijay Kapoor is down but not out

118
01:46:05,170 --> 01:46:09,732
I still have the strength enough
to fight my battles... to win

119
01:46:09,908 --> 01:46:13,139
Papa, listen to me...
- Tell him I wish to speak to no one

120
01:46:22,988 --> 01:46:30,952
Your Papa hasn't been keeping well
of late. He has become irritable

121
01:46:31,930 --> 01:46:36,867
Don't mind him, son.
- No Ma, not his fault at all

122
01:46:38,170 --> 01:46:42,630
It's all my fault

123
01:46:43,342 --> 01:46:49,144
Ma, I still remember crawling
quietly onto Papa's lap...

124
01:46:49,348 --> 01:46:56,277
whenever he was angry with me.
He'd scold me at first. Then...

125
01:46:56,521 --> 01:47:08,865
he'd shower me with love. I don't
even remember the awakening of my ego

126
01:47:10,402 --> 01:47:20,175
He told me to leave, and I left.
Had I only embraced him...

127
01:47:20,379 --> 01:47:24,941
would he not have forgiven me?
He would, wouldn't he, Ma...?

128
01:47:25,083 --> 01:47:27,813
Yes

129
01:47:28,220 --> 01:47:34,523
My ego has ruined this house,
destroyed everything that was mine

130
01:47:36,428 --> 01:47:40,990
I have made everyone so unhappy,
made you unhappy too, Ma...?

131
01:47:41,233 --> 01:47:45,966
No...
- Forgive me, Ma

132
01:47:49,775 --> 01:47:58,911
I could cope with you growing up.
But you've become magnanimous...

133
01:48:00,152 --> 01:48:04,111
I see for the first time

134
01:48:43,762 --> 01:48:46,253
Papa

135
01:49:28,206 --> 01:49:35,669
Anger, pride, leads man on
the path of self-destruction

136
01:49:36,515 --> 01:49:44,286
And often one misunderstands
the one's own benefactor

137
01:49:45,924 --> 01:49:52,625
That error committed,
one loses his benefactor

138
01:49:52,931 --> 01:49:57,698
Vijay, you are committing
that very mistake

139
01:49:58,236 --> 01:50:02,297
By the time you realise, regret...

140
01:50:02,507 --> 01:50:07,877
I fear it may be too late...

141
01:50:08,113 --> 01:50:14,541
to repent. This is the only reason
why I'm stopping you

142
01:50:14,786 --> 01:50:21,692
Don't misbehave with him

143
01:50:21,960 --> 01:50:30,493
Give him your love, be gentle.
Don't give him a prize, if you won't

144
01:50:31,770 --> 01:50:39,575
But at least, don't insult him

145
01:50:44,749 --> 01:50:50,915
Who is it?

146
01:51:05,170 --> 01:51:07,434
Why don't you speak?

147
01:51:07,639 --> 01:51:10,233
What kind of a joke is this?

148
01:51:10,375 --> 01:51:13,105
Who is this?

149
01:51:23,722 --> 01:51:26,589
Who's speaking?
- Ankit Dalal of Dalal Financiers

150
01:51:26,758 --> 01:51:29,750
Yes go on, I'm his son Ajay.
- Mr. Ajay, by now...

151
01:51:29,995 --> 01:51:33,931
you should've arrived at a decision
whether to you pay me or not. Else...

152
01:51:34,199 --> 01:51:37,259
I shall proceed with the auctioning.
- We won't let it be auctioned

153
01:51:37,435 --> 01:51:42,099
Nor will I tolerate men
of your ilk calling up

154
01:51:42,474 --> 01:51:47,104
Mr. Dalal, stay within your limits.
- Why take it out on me?

155
01:51:47,312 --> 01:51:51,339
I'm just a businessman. You ought
to talk to your brother-in-law

156
01:51:51,583 --> 01:51:54,245
He is the one who pawned your house

157
01:52:01,593 --> 01:52:10,467
Ajay, would you like a cup of tea?
- I'm not here, your guest. Tell me...

158
01:52:10,669 --> 01:52:18,337
did Papa make a mistake in giving
you a job? He gave you a new life

159
01:52:18,577 --> 01:52:25,983
Was that his mistake? He loved you,
gave you respect. Was that his crime?

160
01:52:27,919 --> 01:52:31,286
Why did you deceive my Papa?

161
01:52:34,693 --> 01:52:43,965
You have ruined my home, robbed us
of our peace, our happiness. Why?

162
01:52:46,004 --> 01:52:52,068
Ajay, you want justice? Go to court.
Levelling allegations against me...

163
01:52:52,277 --> 01:52:59,308
won't make me a wrongdoer. I cheated
no one, deceived none. I used my brains

164
01:52:59,551 --> 01:53:04,318
I did business with a family of
weeping fools. And I made my money

165
01:53:05,457 --> 01:53:12,556
The relationship ties my hands.
Else, you'd weep tears of blood

166
01:53:12,797 --> 01:53:15,766
And you'd come walking home to us
to return our money

167
01:53:15,934 --> 01:53:23,431
Old adage, Ajay. The sister's husband
is more precious than most by far

168
01:53:23,708 --> 01:53:29,578
I can be charitable. A five, a ten,
twenty, fifty, hundred...?

169
01:53:29,748 --> 01:53:38,281
Not in millions. Units.
Proffer that hand, supplicate

170
01:53:39,557 --> 01:53:51,765
Never have I stood in supplication.
If ever, that'd be a slip on my part

171
01:53:51,936 --> 01:53:55,303
But it will cost you dearly.
- You will raise your hands...

172
01:53:55,573 --> 01:54:00,943
on your brother-in-law? Ajay, I won't
tolerate fools and madmen for long

173
01:54:16,094 --> 01:54:18,562
Open the door

174
01:54:18,897 --> 01:54:21,422
Open up

175
01:54:21,633 --> 01:54:25,535
Police station? There's an arsonist
in my house! He's wreaking havoc

176
01:54:25,770 --> 01:54:28,933
Hurry up and come over.
Yes, write down my address

177
01:55:18,890 --> 01:55:20,858
Ajay! Stop

178
01:55:22,527 --> 01:55:26,019
Leave him!
- Preeti, he has ruined us

179
01:55:26,131 --> 01:55:27,996
He mustn't be spared.
He ought to be...

180
01:55:28,166 --> 01:55:31,567
Ajay! For my sake

181
01:55:31,936 --> 01:55:35,303
Are you all right?
- Where's the goon?

182
01:55:35,573 --> 01:55:37,131
Mr. Rajesh, where's the goon?

183
01:55:37,275 --> 01:55:40,642
Arrest him

184
01:55:40,812 --> 01:55:43,508
He's the arsonist!

185
01:55:43,681 --> 01:55:48,243
Give me a medical examination.
Frame him! Make sure...

186
01:55:48,419 --> 01:55:52,253
he doesn't even get bail.
- You...

187
01:55:52,357 --> 01:55:54,757
Hey you goon!
- You saw that?

188
01:55:54,926 --> 01:55:57,588
He accosts me in your presence!
- What's your name?

189
01:55:57,796 --> 01:56:01,926
Behave yourself. I'm Ajay Kapoor,
Vijay Kapoor's son, get that?

190
01:56:02,100 --> 01:56:05,968
You're Vijay Kapoor's son?
- Yes

191
01:56:06,171 --> 01:56:10,631
Son, why all this? You end up in the
cophouse. He has a case against you

192
01:56:10,875 --> 01:56:14,038
Stop eyeballing me

193
01:56:15,013 --> 01:56:17,413
Get lost.
- Where are you taking him?

194
01:56:17,615 --> 01:56:19,913
What's all this going on?
- You end up in the lock-up

195
01:56:20,084 --> 01:56:22,348
What are you up to?

196
01:56:24,823 --> 01:56:27,018
Sign this

197
01:56:28,560 --> 01:56:32,394
Show him out. Let decent folks be

198
01:56:32,564 --> 01:56:35,124
Come on out

199
01:56:44,175 --> 01:56:49,670
Never in my life have I ever been to
a police station. All because of you...

200
01:56:49,881 --> 01:56:56,218
I was forced to sit in that hell
for hours. Of this violence...

201
01:56:56,421 --> 01:57:01,688
what can be the outcome?
Come on, tell me. God forbid...

202
01:57:01,893 --> 01:57:06,557
if something happened to Rajesh,
you would've made Preeti a widow

203
01:57:07,332 --> 01:57:11,393
All your life you'd be in jail,
and we'd be the worse off for it

204
01:57:15,139 --> 01:57:25,344
D'you think violence will solve
your problems? Don't you forget...

205
01:57:25,550 --> 01:57:29,748
Rajesh is my son-in-law.
If he is as much as touched...

206
01:57:30,054 --> 01:57:39,361
it's our Preeti who will suffer.
Easy task that was for me

207
01:57:39,597 --> 01:57:49,404
The worst of goons in town, kiss
my doorstep. In minutes, it'd be done

208
01:57:55,380 --> 01:58:01,444
Preeti is trying to reason with Rajesh.
She's trying to change him

209
01:58:01,653 --> 01:58:04,019
A miracle might happen

210
01:58:04,455 --> 01:58:08,824
Rajesh, you are my husband.
It's my duty to tell you

211
01:58:09,160 --> 01:58:17,795
It's not too late. Return Papa's money.
Apologise to him. You have my word...

212
01:58:18,002 --> 01:58:25,408
Papa will respect you even more.
- As long as the money is mine...

213
01:58:25,576 --> 01:58:32,641
my clout I have. I needn't go seeking.
- But the money isn't yours, Rajesh

214
01:58:32,884 --> 01:58:39,221
My family has never wished you ill.
Instead, they embraced you

215
01:58:39,791 --> 01:58:44,728
Believe me, had you asked Papa for the
money, he would've given it to you...

216
01:58:44,963 --> 01:58:47,955
with a smile.
- As in alms?

217
01:58:49,033 --> 01:58:57,202
You wanted me to beg of your father?
- Instead, you deceive him, rob him?

218
01:58:58,109 --> 01:59:04,537
I deceived no one! I did business,
I used my brains

219
01:59:05,950 --> 01:59:14,380
Had I sourced it from elsewhere,
you would've had a splash, enjoyed it

220
01:59:15,927 --> 01:59:21,866
But you sermonise me, because
I made it off your father?

221
01:59:22,900 --> 01:59:27,428
I'll-gotten gains, be it from
anywhere, I would never touch

222
01:59:29,140 --> 01:59:34,077
Rajesh, money made this way
lasts all of a very short while

223
01:59:34,445 --> 01:59:37,243
And the rest of your life
will be a punishment

224
01:59:37,515 --> 01:59:43,579
Please Rajesh, return
these wages of sin

225
01:59:45,023 --> 01:59:48,982
Preeti, you have no right
to disabuse my efforts as sin

226
01:59:51,195 --> 01:59:56,394
And don't you think that because
I love you and I respect you...

227
01:59:56,601 --> 01:59:59,434
I will go on listening to whatever
you have to say

228
02:00:01,139 --> 02:00:04,631
Don't meddle with my business

229
02:00:10,882 --> 02:00:16,946
Our laws are fabricated
around loopholes

230
02:00:17,822 --> 02:00:22,350
Isn't there any way
to prevent this auction?

231
02:00:22,493 --> 02:00:24,620
Mr. Malhotra, can't we procure
a stay order...

232
02:00:24,762 --> 02:00:27,526
so as to give us at least
some time to think...?

233
02:00:27,765 --> 02:00:31,997
Consider the stay order granted.
I will get hearings postponed...

234
02:00:32,136 --> 02:00:35,401
by four, maybe six months.
The appeal will be filed tomorrow

235
02:00:42,180 --> 02:00:46,378
Look at that.
- The car's turn to con us

236
02:00:48,986 --> 02:00:53,286
Make yourself comfortable on the bench.
Let me look for a mechanic

237
02:00:53,458 --> 02:00:55,983
Back in five minutes

238
02:01:06,838 --> 02:01:20,047
Sahib! You don't recognise me?
I'm Rameshwar... sandwich-man

239
02:01:21,085 --> 02:01:24,213
I used to vend sandwiches
outside your factory

240
02:01:24,355 --> 02:01:27,222
What a business I had!
Roaring, rip-roaring

241
02:01:27,625 --> 02:01:34,622
What evil eye was it?
Factory closed down...

242
02:01:34,832 --> 02:01:47,677
Sahib, I hear talk of the factory
being pulled down for highrises...?

243
02:01:48,946 --> 02:01:55,977
Sahib, the poor workers worship you.
For them, you are the breadwinner

244
02:01:57,221 --> 02:02:01,658
They have faith, the Sahib won't
let them starve

245
02:02:03,361 --> 02:02:09,322
Your faith, your prayers will
surely help us save the factory

246
02:02:12,503 --> 02:02:20,535
Sahib, one request. Before you leave,
do eat one of my sandwiches

247
02:02:21,879 --> 02:02:25,406
No, let it be.
- Go on Papa, have one

248
02:02:25,550 --> 02:02:29,714
You've never broken anyone's heart.
Don't break his

249
02:02:31,956 --> 02:02:35,858
Make us a sandwich.
Lots of peppers

250
02:02:36,060 --> 02:02:40,554
Coming right up, sahib.
- Make it fast. I'm hungry

251
02:02:42,433 --> 02:02:45,925
Thanks

252
02:02:48,372 --> 02:02:51,432
Have a bite, Papa.
- No, go on

253
02:02:51,642 --> 02:02:54,543
Have one piece, Papa.
- I want nothing

254
02:03:42,927 --> 02:03:46,055
Since when did you start eating
so much peppers?

255
02:03:46,264 --> 02:03:52,260
You remember feeding me on your lap
when I was a baby? It was so bland

256
02:03:52,870 --> 02:03:58,536
Not even a dash of pepper. And you'd
eat that bland stuff with me. But...

257
02:03:58,809 --> 02:04:03,576
you loved eating peppers,
pepper was your weakness

258
02:04:03,748 --> 02:04:10,586
So I had this sandwich spiced up,
to enjoy your kind of taste

259
02:04:45,790 --> 02:04:56,462
Papa, ever since my childhood,
whenever I stumbled, whenever I fell...

260
02:04:57,268 --> 02:05:04,674
it was you who has been helping me
up on my feet. Today...

261
02:05:04,909 --> 02:05:14,682
when you falter before a storm,
can I not support you?

262
02:05:17,722 --> 02:05:23,354
Why will you not
let me hold your hand...

263
02:05:23,561 --> 02:05:26,530
Papa...?

264
02:06:24,722 --> 02:06:29,455
Am I the one on your mind?
Every moment, I've been missing you

265
02:06:31,262 --> 02:06:35,096
Let's put an end to
this missing each other

266
02:06:35,299 --> 02:06:42,330
Ajay, it was my mistake!
I fought with you for no reason

267
02:06:44,108 --> 02:06:49,944
Forgive me, forgive me Ajay!
Without you, I can't live

268
02:06:51,248 --> 02:06:54,217
Without you, I can't live

269
02:06:57,555 --> 02:07:02,049
Knowingly, unknowingly, if I ever
committed any mistake, forgive me

270
02:07:12,536 --> 02:07:17,235
I love you so much

271
02:07:35,793 --> 02:07:39,251
All dressed up and going where?

272
02:07:40,030 --> 02:07:43,864
Today's Brothers' Day. I'm going...
- You aren't going anywhere

273
02:07:44,068 --> 02:07:47,333
You aren't feting any brother

274
02:07:49,373 --> 02:07:53,070
For all you're worth,
try stopping me today

275
02:07:54,411 --> 02:08:01,749
To our relationship, I've given in.
But not to slavery

276
02:08:02,920 --> 02:08:05,821
You cannot force me not
to fete my brothers

277
02:08:06,023 --> 02:08:10,517
What brother? Don't forget,
that brother raised his hand...

278
02:08:10,694 --> 02:08:13,128
against your husband.
- Not against my husband

279
02:08:13,430 --> 02:08:19,062
He raised his hand against a traitor,
a thief, a fraud who looted my father

280
02:08:35,386 --> 02:08:43,851
I, a thief? A fraud? Rather than let
you go to see that scum...

281
02:08:44,061 --> 02:08:49,124
I'd tie a lodestone around your neck
and throw you into the sea to drown

282
02:09:00,778 --> 02:09:03,576
Don't you try to force your way
into my house

283
02:10:11,115 --> 02:10:17,611
Who broke down this door?
- He! Once again. Arrest him

284
02:10:18,155 --> 02:10:25,493
Today's Brothers' Day. And he
wouldn't let me see my sister

285
02:10:25,729 --> 02:10:32,225
Now I get everything!
Listen here...

286
02:10:32,503 --> 02:10:39,033
what are you, man? No power on earth
can keep a brother from seeing...

287
02:10:39,276 --> 02:10:46,705
his sister on Brother's Day. And till
date, no law's for holding a brother...

288
02:10:46,917 --> 02:10:53,186
because he wants to see his sister
on Brothers' Day... hey, are you mad?

289
02:10:53,624 --> 02:10:59,460
Ajay, this day every year, a sister has
the right to ask her brother for a gift

290
02:10:59,830 --> 02:11:07,532
Tell me Sister, what do you want?
- The vow of protecting your sister

291
02:11:07,738 --> 02:11:13,904
Today, I ask you to protect me.
Take me home

292
02:11:14,044 --> 02:11:20,381
Take me away from here, forever

293
02:11:20,784 --> 02:11:24,811
Take me home

294
02:11:28,892 --> 02:11:33,920
Fool, who saves your day now?

295
02:11:36,066 --> 02:11:43,199
As long as she lived in your house,
she shielded you. Now she's gone

296
02:11:43,373 --> 02:11:50,006
Now brother, who saves you?
God help you

297
02:11:50,547 --> 02:12:01,185
Forgive me! The entire family
is paying for one mistake of mine

298
02:12:01,358 --> 02:12:04,953
Paying...? What do you mean?
Look at me

299
02:12:05,129 --> 02:12:09,395
It's just happenstance. You aren't
the only one who was mistaken...

300
02:12:09,633 --> 02:12:13,034
about Rajesh. I was mistaken,
your mother was mistaken...

301
02:12:13,237 --> 02:12:20,075
others in the family went wrong too.
You know how man differs from God?

302
02:12:20,844 --> 02:12:26,476
It's human to err in the judgement
of men. God doesn't. Thus He's God

303
02:12:26,683 --> 02:12:31,950
As far as relationships are concerned,
yes men are deceived at times

304
02:12:32,923 --> 02:12:36,154
One who breaks off, loses everything

305
02:12:36,393 --> 02:12:39,385
Ones who conjoin, thrive forever

306
02:12:43,400 --> 02:12:50,636
For parents, the greatest happiness
is the joy of their children

307
02:12:52,609 --> 02:12:56,705
Today, the entire family
has again come together

308
02:12:56,947 --> 02:13:02,351
Who could be as lucky
a mother as I am?

309
02:13:03,821 --> 02:13:06,813
Now let's celebrate Brothers' Day

310
02:13:08,959 --> 02:13:15,922
Ma, aren't we missing someone? Nisha?
- Yes, Nisha

311
02:13:16,600 --> 02:13:24,132
Ajay, why don't you bring Nisha home?
- Tonight you bring her home

312
02:13:24,408 --> 02:13:27,639
Must have a look-see at my friend,
now that she's my sister-in-law

313
02:13:27,878 --> 02:13:33,180
Priya is at her father's. Let her rest.
- No more Ajay. We'll see to it...

314
02:13:33,450 --> 02:13:37,682
that she gets more comforts
than she has at her father's home

315
02:13:37,955 --> 02:13:44,258
Wonderful! If a useless fellow like me
lives off the lay of the land...

316
02:13:44,494 --> 02:13:49,329
why can't the bride?
- And we have yet to give her...

317
02:13:49,533 --> 02:13:54,971
her fertility rites.
- Our prime duty is to protect our turf

318
02:13:55,172 --> 02:14:00,109
Fertility rites can wait.
- Why? We might be going...

319
02:14:00,377 --> 02:14:06,043
through trying times.
But her ritual we will give her

320
02:14:06,283 --> 02:14:10,014
Even the poorest who can't afford it,
will put a lamp at their doorstep...

321
02:14:10,220 --> 02:14:17,251
to celebrate the Festival of Lights.
- Not another word. Bring her home

322
02:14:17,461 --> 02:14:20,328
We'll start preparing
for her fertility rites

323
02:14:22,833 --> 02:14:33,141
You can take Nisha with you,
provided you sign these papers

324
02:14:50,661 --> 02:14:56,964
Very well sir, let me take her home

325
02:14:58,702 --> 02:15:04,197
I'll have these papers
sent back with Nisha

326
02:15:04,374 --> 02:15:11,246
Nisha, I have a request. Please don't
let my folks get to know...

327
02:15:11,481 --> 02:15:15,247
how things are between us

328
02:15:52,189 --> 02:16:01,928
"Your coming lights up my home"

329
02:16:02,132 --> 02:16:10,096
"Blessed is my home,
I adore you"

330
02:16:11,108 --> 02:16:33,761
"Oh, we're all so happy"

331
02:17:05,128 --> 02:17:13,058
"My nights were so stark
So stark my days were"

332
02:17:13,837 --> 02:17:21,767
"How do I tell you, how I lived
through the separation"

333
02:17:23,513 --> 02:17:33,013
"You're back,
and my home is all lit up"

334
02:17:33,323 --> 02:17:42,630
"Blessed is my home,
I adore you"

335
02:17:42,799 --> 02:17:57,339
"Oh, we're all so happy"

336
02:18:28,245 --> 02:18:32,306
"You called out to me,
and here I am"

337
02:18:32,516 --> 02:18:36,885
"My lost life,
I've found again"

338
02:18:37,053 --> 02:18:45,483
"In you, I have found
my every happiness"

339
02:18:46,463 --> 02:18:57,772
"The chasm is bridged,
our home is all lit up"

340
02:18:57,974 --> 02:19:04,937
"Blessed is my home,
I adore you"

341
02:19:05,148 --> 02:19:22,362
"Oh, we're all so happy"

342
02:19:42,152 --> 02:19:50,423
"Tears of joy fill my eyes,
I cannot hold my tears back"

343
02:19:51,061 --> 02:19:59,400
"What else have I to say?
My tears have said it all"

344
02:20:00,270 --> 02:20:09,338
"Look, how smiles bring cheer"

345
02:20:10,113 --> 02:20:19,146
"Blessed is my home,
I adore you"

346
02:20:19,389 --> 02:20:26,989
"Your coming lights up my home"

347
02:20:27,764 --> 02:20:35,500
"Blessed is my home,
I adore you"

348
02:20:37,173 --> 02:21:12,603
"Oh, we're all so happy"

349
02:21:17,580 --> 02:21:21,983
I will make do with whatever we have,
every sorrow I shall bear

350
02:21:22,185 --> 02:21:26,281
But I don't want to leave you Ajay.
I don't want to go away

351
02:21:26,456 --> 02:21:29,482
I want to be here. With you.

352
02:21:29,626 --> 02:21:34,120
Once we held hands, we swore
to be together for a lifetime

353
02:21:34,297 --> 02:21:38,597
But today, you're about
to leave me forever

354
02:21:38,802 --> 02:21:46,732
Ajay, I want something from you.
- I know. Here you are

355
02:21:48,211 --> 02:21:55,640
What's this?
- Divorce papers

356
02:21:56,720 --> 02:21:58,915
Divorce...?

357
02:21:59,089 --> 02:22:02,684
Your father is waiting for you.
Come downstairs

358
02:22:18,541 --> 02:22:33,047
Daddy! Take me home Daddy.
- Yes my child

359
02:22:59,115 --> 02:23:01,413
What did he have to say
about the stay order?

360
02:23:02,552 --> 02:23:05,680
It has been dismissed

361
02:23:09,359 --> 02:23:15,355
Not to worry. Today or tomorrow,
Brij is arriving from London

362
02:23:15,532 --> 02:23:18,763
I'll have the money once he's here.
Find out when he's expected

363
02:23:19,936 --> 02:23:32,576
What if he doesn't arrive in time?
- Then you and I are going somewhere

364
02:23:41,991 --> 02:23:50,194
Friends, I come before you to plead.
All that was in my power...

365
02:23:50,400 --> 02:24:01,174
to save the factory, I have done.
But I don't think I will be able...

366
02:24:01,311 --> 02:24:12,745
to save the factory. The relationship
we shared, I wanted to nurture...

367
02:24:12,889 --> 02:24:20,887
as long as I lived.
For this lapse...

368
02:24:21,030 --> 02:24:25,967
if you can, forgive me

369
02:24:35,178 --> 02:24:40,047
What did Uncle Brij have to say?
- He's right here, in town

370
02:24:40,116 --> 02:24:42,914
But for our family,
he's away in London

371
02:24:43,086 --> 02:24:49,184
Papa made friends with a businessman,
but his friendship was a trade-off

372
02:24:49,959 --> 02:24:56,091
It's best for Papa not to know this.
He was Papa's last hope

373
02:24:56,299 --> 02:25:00,827
He won't live through the shock of it.
- Oh, what is to happen now?

374
02:25:01,804 --> 02:25:06,173
Get a hold on yourself. I still have
faith, everything's going to be fine

375
02:25:15,518 --> 02:25:18,248
Stop! What's going on?

376
02:25:18,888 --> 02:25:22,619
Let go of him, I say

377
02:25:22,892 --> 02:25:24,951
Are you out of your mind?

378
02:25:29,232 --> 02:25:32,497
For 2 months the factory has been shut!
- We're starving to death

379
02:25:32,635 --> 02:25:36,071
We have no future left!
And he's enjoying himself

380
02:25:36,239 --> 02:25:38,833
He's living it up!
Drinking everyday!

381
02:25:39,008 --> 02:25:44,241
Having girls... having fun!
No sparing him! Burn him alive

382
02:25:44,380 --> 02:25:54,255
This is wrong! He had no hand
in closing down the factory

383
02:26:06,202 --> 02:26:14,166
Go, and try to share with them
their sorrows

384
02:26:16,346 --> 02:26:19,645
Share a joy, and joy abounds

385
02:26:19,816 --> 02:26:27,916
Share a grief, and its burden
is lessened. Take care of them

386
02:26:31,928 --> 02:26:47,834
You saved my life... why?
Why this mercy, unasked for?

387
02:26:49,145 --> 02:26:57,052
Why mercy to a criminal?
Why make the workers feel for me?

388
02:26:57,220 --> 02:27:02,351
You don't know! I took you on
at the factory for a purpose

389
02:27:02,558 --> 02:27:06,050
I disgraced you by forcing you
to apologise to me

390
02:27:08,531 --> 02:27:18,566
But I wasn't like this always.
Time was when I'd die for my employer

391
02:27:18,775 --> 02:27:28,480
What my employer has done for us,
I knew. Food, clothing, housing

392
02:27:28,751 --> 02:27:33,814
He even built a school
for our children

393
02:27:34,090 --> 02:27:38,925
But for just a little money,
I forgot it all

394
02:27:39,362 --> 02:27:44,925
I even forgot that unless the machines
work in the factory...

395
02:27:45,134 --> 02:27:55,009
our kitchen fires will not be lit.
My employer I have betrayed

396
02:27:56,479 --> 02:28:03,544
After this day, no employer
will ever trust his employee

397
02:28:03,786 --> 02:28:09,554
Never will workers
trust their leaders

398
02:28:09,959 --> 02:28:14,055
A beating, they might forgive

399
02:28:14,297 --> 02:28:20,930
But I have deprived them
of their livelihood

400
02:28:22,572 --> 02:28:25,666
For the grave crime
that I've committed...

401
02:28:25,875 --> 02:28:35,250
their families are paying. I forgot!
No worker can ever prosper...

402
02:28:35,384 --> 02:28:47,785
once his employer is ruined.
Sahib, my loyalties lie nowhere

403
02:28:47,964 --> 02:28:51,923
Not with my employer,
not with my fellow-workers

404
02:28:52,401 --> 02:29:00,103
My loyalties lie nowhere!
Kill me, hack me to pieces

405
02:29:00,276 --> 02:29:04,679
I have no right to live

406
02:29:04,881 --> 02:29:08,339
No Hari Singh, get a hold
on yourself

407
02:29:08,518 --> 02:29:12,545
You have repented,
and that is enough

408
02:29:12,789 --> 02:29:17,158
No! I shall atone

409
02:29:17,293 --> 02:29:19,523
I shall

410
02:29:19,695 --> 02:29:25,634
Come, let's stake our lives!
Don't let our employers come to harm

411
02:29:25,935 --> 02:29:32,067
One fight we have lost,
but this war we shall win

412
02:29:33,009 --> 02:29:36,137
Too late Hari Singh

413
02:29:36,813 --> 02:29:39,111
Too late now

414
02:29:39,749 --> 02:29:44,516
We haven't the time
to put together so much money

415
02:29:44,854 --> 02:29:50,486
We've lost our home, our factory

416
02:29:50,893 --> 02:29:55,330
I'm his wife, and a married woman will
never take off her wedding necklace...

417
02:29:55,531 --> 02:30:02,095
till her husband is alive. This is the
mark of the woman's faith in her man

418
02:30:02,238 --> 02:30:08,802
It's in faith that I entrust you
with this. Keep it

419
02:30:15,918 --> 02:30:22,482
This can never be! I appreciate
your feelings. But the truth is...

420
02:30:22,692 --> 02:30:30,326
this won't be enough to pool the money.
- It'll be done. It will be done

421
02:30:30,466 --> 02:30:34,425
Our homes... they are yours

422
02:30:35,071 --> 02:30:37,631
These four thousand homes, for you

423
02:30:37,940 --> 02:30:45,711
Mortgage these. But save your house,
save our factory

424
02:30:47,183 --> 02:30:54,612
Our dreams, our tomorrows, our future
are all tied to you

425
02:30:56,893 --> 02:30:59,794
Say, we're with you

426
02:31:00,363 --> 02:31:04,527
We're with you

427
02:31:06,002 --> 02:31:12,703
If I have your prayers,
your blessings, your sacrifices...

428
02:31:12,909 --> 02:31:15,935
then this war we'll surely win

429
02:31:16,612 --> 02:31:22,050
Begging from beggars to buy back
the house and the factory?

430
02:31:25,154 --> 02:31:29,352
Mr. Khanna, you will bid for me when
the bungalow is being auctioned

431
02:31:29,558 --> 02:31:33,961
The factory we'll buy out
at cost-plus

432
02:31:40,403 --> 02:31:42,735
Did you have to pay in
the earnest money...

433
02:31:42,872 --> 02:31:48,071
for the bidding without
as much as a thought?

434
02:31:48,744 --> 02:31:53,408
You expect Rajesh to leave anything
to chance? And where comes...

435
02:31:53,582 --> 02:32:00,488
the rest of the money from?
- No matter how much Rakesh bids...

436
02:32:00,656 --> 02:32:07,027
but we'll save this house from falling.
Uncle will bid for us

437
02:32:07,129 --> 02:32:13,534
This mansion was mortgaged
for 500 million

438
02:32:13,703 --> 02:32:18,367
Not a cent in my pocket,
and here I am, bidding

439
02:32:18,975 --> 02:32:22,672
I will go on raising the bid.
But do you have the money?

440
02:32:22,878 --> 02:32:27,611
Just keep upping the stake

441
02:32:29,752 --> 02:32:32,243
Businessmen and the workers
are both bidding

442
02:32:32,355 --> 02:32:36,917
The floor price is 500 million

443
02:32:37,693 --> 02:32:38,955
51 0 million

444
02:32:43,366 --> 02:32:44,799
600 million

445
02:32:44,967 --> 02:32:47,128
61 0 million

446
02:32:50,506 --> 02:32:51,837
700 million

447
02:32:51,974 --> 02:32:53,965
71 0 million

448
02:32:54,110 --> 02:32:55,668
800 million

449
02:32:55,811 --> 02:32:58,371
Come on gentlemen, bid

450
02:33:02,885 --> 02:33:04,978
81 0 million

451
02:33:13,362 --> 02:33:16,126
Bid 900 million

452
02:33:17,466 --> 02:33:19,559
900 million

453
02:33:20,870 --> 02:33:23,566
91 0 million

454
02:33:29,545 --> 02:33:31,570
1 billion

455
02:33:31,781 --> 02:33:33,578
1 billion

456
02:33:33,749 --> 02:33:36,582
1 billion from Mr. Khanna

457
02:33:38,788 --> 02:33:42,121
Look like no one is going
to cross a billion

458
02:33:42,324 --> 02:33:46,283
No more voices?

459
02:33:46,462 --> 02:33:49,659
The bidding seems to be over

460
02:33:52,968 --> 02:33:56,426
1 billion... one... two...

461
02:33:58,074 --> 02:34:02,511
1.25 billion

462
02:34:06,082 --> 02:34:11,315
Back out

463
02:34:14,990 --> 02:34:18,357
Anyone bidding more?

464
02:34:19,662 --> 02:34:29,902
1.25 billion... one... two...

465
02:34:30,039 --> 02:34:33,998
Three. Sold

466
02:34:49,925 --> 02:34:52,257
Do you realise what papers
you have just signed?

467
02:34:52,394 --> 02:34:56,990
The transfer deed?
- No. Undertaking to the government

468
02:34:57,133 --> 02:35:02,093
Unless you deposit 1.25 billion in
2 days, you've lost your earnest money

469
02:35:05,107 --> 02:35:10,477
This moment's victory is meaningless.
This is a far worse insult

470
02:35:10,679 --> 02:35:14,012
When the court attaches
the earnest money...

471
02:35:14,150 --> 02:35:17,916
the world will laugh at us.
- Trust me. I'll organise everything

472
02:35:18,053 --> 02:35:23,252
The money isn't exactly raining.
Nor have you found a treasure

473
02:35:23,492 --> 02:35:33,163
Where will you find so much?
- We're going to have it

474
02:36:09,238 --> 02:36:12,605
"I'm new in town.
Give me a hug"

475
02:36:12,942 --> 02:36:16,173
"And slake your thirst"

476
02:36:16,779 --> 02:36:20,772
"Look at me, my wild ones"

477
02:36:20,950 --> 02:36:25,148
"Such beauty you will never find"

478
02:36:25,621 --> 02:36:32,026
"Come and look me up"

479
02:36:33,362 --> 02:36:48,767
"For that which comes to mind"

480
02:37:22,411 --> 02:37:26,211
"Don't give me that light flutter
in my heart, it makes me pine"

481
02:37:26,382 --> 02:37:29,874
"Don't desert me,
after those promises"

482
02:37:30,119 --> 02:37:33,520
"Don't let the wait
rob the opportunity"

483
02:37:33,756 --> 02:37:37,658
"Just make love to me, once"

484
02:37:39,995 --> 02:37:43,192
"Ask me out, wherever you want"

485
02:37:43,465 --> 02:37:48,095
"Drown your sorrows,
come to me"

486
02:37:48,270 --> 02:37:50,898
"Look at me, my wild ones"

487
02:37:51,140 --> 02:37:54,667
"Such beauty you will never find"

488
02:37:55,944 --> 02:38:04,352
"Come and look me up"

489
02:38:04,520 --> 02:38:09,981
"Talk your hearts out"

490
02:38:49,164 --> 02:38:52,258
"Give me thirst in my eyes, the colour
to my cheeks, the welt on my lips"

491
02:38:52,701 --> 02:38:56,193
"Take from me the colour of my tresses,
my blush, the throb in me"

492
02:38:56,638 --> 02:38:59,869
"Let me have the first taste Spring"

493
02:39:00,275 --> 02:39:04,041
"Snatches of a night together,
but give me all the fun"

494
02:39:06,348 --> 02:39:09,613
"I'm more tender than a blossom
Take me in your arms"

495
02:39:09,852 --> 02:39:13,413
"Hold my fragrance
under your breath"

496
02:39:13,756 --> 02:39:17,214
"Hey wild ones..."

497
02:39:17,459 --> 02:39:22,226
"Such beauty you will never find"

498
02:39:22,398 --> 02:39:30,464
"Come and look me up"

499
02:39:30,606 --> 02:39:37,978
"For that which comes to mind"

500
02:40:48,016 --> 02:40:51,543
There's an arsonist in my house

501
02:40:51,787 --> 02:40:55,655
Can't hear... louder

502
02:40:57,359 --> 02:41:00,453
Bad line

503
02:41:01,096 --> 02:41:04,588
This one is a really bad sort

504
02:41:04,833 --> 02:41:08,428
Don't take the call if the phone rings

505
02:41:08,604 --> 02:41:11,232
Let the folks tear him apart

506
02:41:15,277 --> 02:41:23,184
No! Ajay, forgive me!

507
02:41:23,552 --> 02:41:27,488
For Preeti's sake!
Forgive me

508
02:41:34,129 --> 02:41:37,121
From Hinduja Hospital

509
02:41:37,533 --> 02:41:41,594
You've fathered a son

510
02:42:12,734 --> 02:42:17,865
What are you doing? Put my baby down!
He's crying

511
02:42:18,073 --> 02:42:28,472
You hear him crying, but you couldn't
hear me weep for my parents?

512
02:42:28,650 --> 02:42:31,448
I don't want to hear
that malicious crap

513
02:42:31,853 --> 02:42:37,348
You have ruined my life,
taken away my happiness

514
02:42:38,093 --> 02:42:42,553
You have no right to that baby!
You have divorced me

515
02:42:43,098 --> 02:42:45,589
Because that was what you wanted

516
02:42:45,767 --> 02:42:48,668
Lies... lies

517
02:42:48,804 --> 02:42:54,265
Lies? Ask your Daddy.
Divorce was the condition...

518
02:42:54,443 --> 02:43:00,245
he laid down for letting me
take you home for the ritual

519
02:43:00,549 --> 02:43:06,385
Daddy would never do anything as evil!
- Ask your Dad

520
02:43:06,622 --> 02:43:14,393
And if you weren't part of it,
you can come home whenever you want

521
02:43:15,597 --> 02:43:21,399
I'm taking my son.
- Where are you taking my son?

522
02:43:22,838 --> 02:43:24,738
Don't take my baby away

523
02:43:27,042 --> 02:43:29,203
He's taking my son away

524
02:43:29,344 --> 02:43:31,869
Why doesn't someone stop him?

525
02:43:37,719 --> 02:43:40,688
Taking a child away from
its mother is a grave sin

526
02:43:40,889 --> 02:43:47,158
I beg of you! Ajay, don't take
my baby away from me. For my sake

527
02:43:47,562 --> 02:43:52,829
Don't take my baby away. I won't
live for a moment without him

528
02:43:53,235 --> 02:43:55,533
I'm going to die

529
02:43:59,741 --> 02:44:05,043
You'll die? You'll kill yourself?

530
02:44:05,247 --> 02:44:12,847
For this child one-day-old child?
What about the son...

531
02:44:13,055 --> 02:44:25,058
you wanted to take away from parents
who reared him for 25 years?

532
02:44:25,267 --> 02:44:34,642
For them, he is their hope.
Wouldn't that separation...

533
02:44:34,776 --> 02:44:40,612
from their son, kill them?

534
02:44:52,227 --> 02:44:57,164
Sir! Save my life, sir!

535
02:44:57,265 --> 02:44:59,256
They're going to kill me!

536
02:44:59,401 --> 02:45:01,494
At a word from you,
they will turn away

537
02:45:01,603 --> 02:45:04,731
I beg you for my life!
I'm your son-in-law

538
02:45:04,906 --> 02:45:08,103
I married your daughter, sir!

539
02:45:08,977 --> 02:45:12,606
You need not tell me what
your relationship is with me

540
02:45:14,683 --> 02:45:18,483
This house you did not enter
seeking a relationship

541
02:45:19,755 --> 02:45:23,020
You came here to do business

542
02:45:26,962 --> 02:45:30,557
You know what makes a businessman?

543
02:45:30,999 --> 02:45:41,807
A businessman is applies himself,
his skill, his time diligently...

544
02:45:41,977 --> 02:45:46,573
this is what he trades,
in recompense wherefor...

545
02:45:46,848 --> 02:45:49,544
he earns

546
02:45:49,718 --> 02:45:56,715
You are n businessman.
You are merely an opportunist...

547
02:45:57,025 --> 02:46:05,023
who cunningly shrouded his ambitions
in the cloak of a relationship...

548
02:46:05,200 --> 02:46:12,402
to deceive people.
You are a cheat

549
02:46:18,780 --> 02:46:23,774
And you could con me only because
I trusted you

550
02:46:24,085 --> 02:46:29,489
And you poisoned my trust

551
02:46:31,893 --> 02:46:39,095
Even snakes sometimes
spare their prey

552
02:46:39,334 --> 02:46:45,569
But snake in the grass, that
you are, you spared no one

553
02:46:46,341 --> 02:46:50,141
You engaged me in a game
of snakes and ladders

554
02:46:50,278 --> 02:46:55,875
At every opportunity,
you climbed a ladder

555
02:46:56,785 --> 02:47:02,382
You ruined the very ones
who reposed their trust in you

556
02:47:05,126 --> 02:47:13,591
Then you forgot all about
the snake at 99...

557
02:47:13,768 --> 02:47:19,297
that takes the player
all the way down...

558
02:47:19,541 --> 02:47:26,572
to where there's no chance
of a climb again

559
02:47:28,149 --> 02:47:32,415
Where did you take your education?
Where were you taught...

560
02:47:32,587 --> 02:47:40,426
this triumph of the evil?
Not one story tells you that

561
02:47:41,296 --> 02:47:46,859
How then, did you expect the outcome
of this story to be different?

562
02:47:47,702 --> 02:47:51,502
Did you expect to pen a new novel?

563
02:47:54,175 --> 02:47:57,576
How could you imagine that?

564
02:48:08,290 --> 02:48:12,750
Now I'll teach you
how to do business

565
02:48:16,331 --> 02:48:24,966
Now you will say in your own words,
what price that life of yours?

566
02:48:26,675 --> 02:48:34,946
1 00,000, 1 million,
1 0 million, 50 million?

567
02:48:35,150 --> 02:48:46,425
You have time till the workers
break down that door and barge in

568
02:48:50,865 --> 02:48:54,357
No hurry

569
02:48:54,669 --> 02:48:59,436
Here I sir, relaxed

570
02:48:59,607 --> 02:49:05,807
But the price to your life,
you will have to name

571
02:49:14,622 --> 02:49:17,750
Come out

572
02:49:20,795 --> 02:49:22,786
Out

573
02:49:32,407 --> 02:49:37,777
Kill him

574
02:50:31,866 --> 02:50:37,168
I'll return everything!
Everything, sir!

575
02:50:37,272 --> 02:50:42,505
All of it

576
02:50:46,247 --> 02:50:49,148
Sign it

577
02:51:15,043 --> 02:51:22,449
I grew up a motherless child.
I was never told that once married...

578
02:51:22,684 --> 02:51:27,712
a woman makes her husband's home
her only home. Forgive me...

579
02:51:27,889 --> 02:51:30,551
as you'd forgive your daughter

580
02:51:41,936 --> 02:51:50,571
You see son, in cases of certain
relationships, one has to forgive

581
02:51:51,946 --> 02:51:59,682
And I think, the others in this family
will forgive you too

582
02:52:13,501 --> 02:52:19,633
Where's Preeti?
- This is for you

583
02:52:27,348 --> 02:52:31,307
Rajesh, members of my family
might have forgiven you

584
02:52:31,519 --> 02:52:35,216
But I will never forgive you.
Because of you...

585
02:52:35,390 --> 02:52:43,525
my family has suffered. If ever any
daughter forgives a husband like you...

586
02:52:43,698 --> 02:52:47,293
that day, come back to me

587
02:52:55,210 --> 02:52:57,440
One minute... wait

588
02:53:27,008 --> 02:53:34,779
Life is all about relationships.
Those who break away...

589
02:53:35,083 --> 02:53:41,283
Iose those dearest to them.
Those who conjoin...

590
02:53:41,623 --> 02:53:46,390
will even reach
