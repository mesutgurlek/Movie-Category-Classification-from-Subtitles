Nandu, 3 special teas.

00:00:56,956 --> 00:00:57,888

lt seems they have left for here.

00:01:02,062 --> 00:01:03,495
Who will serve water?

00:01:03,897 --> 00:01:04,727

9

00:02:19,606 --> 00:02:20,504
No need to pay me.

18
00:02:20,707 --> 00:02:21,173

19
00:02:21,374 --> 00:02:22,966
He's pestering since morning.

20
00:02:23,176 --> 00:02:25,406
He's asking for work.

21
00:02:25,612 --> 00:02:27,876
You clear out boy...

Please ask him to hire me.

24
00:02:35,922 --> 00:02:37,856
Where did you work earlier?
- Suryapet.

25
00:02:46,065 --> 00:02:46,690
Nandu.

26
00:02:48,334 --> 00:02:49,494
Yesterday he bumped off Suri.

27
00:02:49,869 --> 00:02:50,494
Suri?

28
00:02:50,737 --> 00:02:51,465
Vanka Suri.

29
00:02:51,704 --> 00:02:52,398
Vanka Suri?

30
00:02:52,605 --> 00:02:54,129
He's a big mafia don
in Vijayawada West.

31
00:02:54,340 --> 00:02:56,103
People stop drinking water
on hearing his name.

32
00:02:56,609 --> 00:02:57,871
May be water problem?

33
00:03:01,881 --> 00:03:02,848
First time?

34
00:03:05,785 --> 00:03:06,615
Good start!

35
00:03:07,053 --> 00:03:07,849
Shall l take him into our fold?

36
00:03:09,389 --> 00:03:10,356
First feed him.

37
00:03:10,557 --> 00:03:16,723
Lakshmivilas Bank...the bank Sadhu
is planning to rob...night 1 :42 am...

38
00:03:27,640 --> 00:03:29,904
Malli...you stay here.
Nandu, you come with me.

39
00:03:30,109 --> 00:03:30,905
Move...move...

40
00:03:40,286 --> 00:03:41,014
Move..move..

41
00:03:45,525 --> 00:03:46,651
Chanti, you watch the back.

42
00:03:47,427 --> 00:03:48,655
Where's the gelatin, Manik?

43
00:04:00,840 --> 00:04:01,807
Join the two wires.

44
00:04:02,709 --> 00:04:03,539
Come out fast.

45
00:04:06,546 --> 00:04:07,205
Open it now.

46
00:04:23,029 --> 00:04:24,963
Nandu, faster...faster...

47
00:04:27,100 --> 00:04:28,863
Come on move...move...

48
00:04:30,236 --> 00:04:30,930
Start the vehicle.

49
00:04:58,364 --> 00:05:00,559
Had a nice journey, Sadhu?

50
00:05:09,175 --> 00:05:11,666
Your man Narsing,
changed sides, that's all!.

51
00:05:17,784 --> 00:05:20,719
Looks like someone's hard
earned money, it's smelling sweat.

52
00:05:21,487 --> 00:05:23,216
That's for you and
this is for me, now clear out.

53
00:05:29,429 --> 00:05:31,897
No problem...can withstand
another round also.

54
00:05:32,432 --> 00:05:34,195
Hey, Order teas!

55
00:05:55,822 --> 00:05:58,848
Where are the candles?

56
00:06:22,682 --> 00:06:27,142
That S.l. will definitely kill me.

57
00:06:28,721 --> 00:06:30,484
lf you stay with me,
he'll kill you also.

58
00:06:31,224 --> 00:06:33,658
Go...go away.

59
00:06:35,194 --> 00:06:37,924
He'll not come boss.
l've killed him.

60
00:06:41,234 --> 00:06:51,200
i Dream.

61
00:07:19,839 --> 00:07:23,969
He's a one man army.

62
00:07:24,444 --> 00:07:28,676
He's the new sun to
rise in the dark world.

63
00:07:43,663 --> 00:07:47,724
He's an unchallenged hero.

64
00:07:48,167 --> 00:07:52,570
He's the fiery hero to give
jitters to the tsunami.

65
00:08:57,303 --> 00:09:01,865
lf time chases me,
l'll attack it.

66
00:09:02,074 --> 00:09:06,773
it chooses war,
l'll win over it.

67
00:09:16,222 --> 00:09:18,213
l'm a thunder...

68
00:09:18,424 --> 00:09:20,654
l'm a lightning...

69
00:09:20,893 --> 00:09:23,054
l'm the fire...

70
00:09:23,262 --> 00:09:27,062
l'm cool rain...

71
00:10:08,574 --> 00:10:13,068
He's the ray of light
in pitch darkness.

72
00:10:13,212 --> 00:10:18,377
He's the shore to withstand
the fury of waves.

73
00:10:27,593 --> 00:10:32,326
Mustering courage from self,
overcoming all the hurdles...

74
00:10:32,531 --> 00:10:34,658
...fighting it out everyday of life...

75
00:10:34,867 --> 00:10:38,564
...he's the man of hour.

76
00:10:50,249 --> 00:10:55,744
A road in the Old City...
Second Namaz is in progress...

77
00:11:12,672 --> 00:11:13,297
Has he come?

78
00:11:14,006 --> 00:11:16,907
Watching...matinee show...

79
00:11:18,344 --> 00:11:19,333
Where will you be?

80
00:11:20,613 --> 00:11:22,604
Next street...Red colour Ford.

81
00:11:23,983 --> 00:11:24,711
Be ready.

82
00:11:25,584 --> 00:11:26,346
l'll come immediately
after finishing the job.

83
00:11:26,552 --> 00:11:27,416
Don't delay.

84
00:11:43,436 --> 00:11:44,368
Buy whatever you want.

85
00:11:52,912 --> 00:11:54,345
Kill the bastard, got it?

86
00:11:55,181 --> 00:11:55,943
Don't play with me.

87
00:11:56,148 --> 00:11:56,842
How about these?

88
00:11:57,316 --> 00:11:58,374
Okay...

89
00:12:00,086 --> 00:12:01,485
Okay...be careful.

90
00:12:03,856 --> 00:12:05,187
l want it to be done in 2 days.

91
00:12:05,725 --> 00:12:07,693
lf it is not done...beware...

92
00:12:08,427 --> 00:12:09,052
What else??

93
00:12:19,839 --> 00:12:22,899
Check all over the place.
Bloody killer shouldn't escape!

94
00:12:56,008 --> 00:12:58,135
Look, he's going there.

95
00:13:42,254 --> 00:13:43,516
Bloody! Move man!

96
00:13:43,722 --> 00:13:45,656
No way l'll not move.

97
00:14:39,278 --> 00:14:40,575
Won't they get tired!

98
00:14:41,113 --> 00:14:41,670
They can't jump.

99
00:15:23,722 --> 00:15:24,654
Greetings sir.

100
00:15:25,024 --> 00:15:26,218
Did l made you wait for long?

101
00:15:26,425 --> 00:15:28,120
l've been waiting for
10 years to become CM,

102
00:15:28,327 --> 00:15:29,954
10 minutes isn't a
big thing, sit down.

103
00:15:32,197 --> 00:15:33,061
CM is here.

104
00:15:38,938 --> 00:15:40,735
Opinion polls say
he'll make it again.

105
00:15:41,240 --> 00:15:42,002
He shouldn't.

106
00:15:44,576 --> 00:15:48,672
Powerless politician
is like a widow.- Yes sir.

107
00:15:49,181 --> 00:15:50,512
Every man whistles at you.

108
00:15:53,953 --> 00:15:54,715
No value.

109
00:15:55,955 --> 00:15:58,753
Even people like you make them wait.
- No sir...

110
00:15:58,958 --> 00:15:59,856
Just for an example.

111
00:16:00,459 --> 00:16:03,656
This time we must do it,
otherwise no use.

112
00:16:04,430 --> 00:16:06,125
Already press has
forgotten me,

113
00:16:06,632 --> 00:16:07,621
it'll be very difficult
if people too forget me.

114
00:16:07,833 --> 00:16:08,925
Don't get dejected sir.

115
00:16:09,468 --> 00:16:10,435
Let's buy the votes
at Rs. 1000 a vote,

116
00:16:10,636 --> 00:16:12,501
still if we can't make it,
let's supply liquor freely.

117
00:16:12,705 --> 00:16:15,071
They will doze off having your drinks
and not come to vote for you.

118
00:16:15,274 --> 00:16:17,572
That will be better, we can cast
bogus votes ourselves.

119
00:16:17,776 --> 00:16:19,869
lf we as opposition can
rig the polls,

120
00:16:20,145 --> 00:16:23,512
think about what he can do
with the govt. under his control?

121
00:16:24,984 --> 00:16:26,042
Shall we bump him off?

122
00:16:26,251 --> 00:16:29,743
His wife will become CM
in the sympathy wave.

123
00:16:31,256 --> 00:16:32,223
What should we do then?

124
00:16:36,261 --> 00:16:37,489
Kill me!

125
00:16:42,034 --> 00:16:44,298
lf a boy comes home after
failing the tenth class,

126
00:16:44,603 --> 00:16:45,865
everyone at home will scold him.

127
00:16:46,472 --> 00:16:49,964
After seeing the result
if he attempts suicide,

128
00:16:50,242 --> 00:16:52,642
if public bring home
saving his life,

129
00:16:52,845 --> 00:16:54,312
everyone at home
will console him.

130
00:16:55,514 --> 00:16:58,415
ln the first case, people will be
angry on him for failing.

131
00:16:59,018 --> 00:16:59,985
ln the second case,

132
00:17:00,386 --> 00:17:02,411
there will be sympathy for
surviving the suicide attempt.

133
00:17:02,755 --> 00:17:03,915
l want that.

134
00:17:04,289 --> 00:17:05,119
Sympathy!

135
00:17:05,958 --> 00:17:07,983
So, there should be
an attempt on my life.

136
00:17:08,427 --> 00:17:09,519
But l must survive it.

137
00:17:10,696 --> 00:17:15,030
Farooq, our party election
campaign starts on the 10th.

138
00:17:15,467 --> 00:17:17,435
Stage manage an attempt
on my life the same day.

139
00:17:17,636 --> 00:17:19,263
l'll be admitted into a hospital,

140
00:17:19,705 --> 00:17:21,172
TV Channels will cover the news,

141
00:17:23,308 --> 00:17:26,971
few of my supporters will
immolate themselves.

142
00:17:27,946 --> 00:17:30,244
l'll campaign from
my hospital bed.

143
00:17:30,983 --> 00:17:32,780
l'll give an interview
sleeping on the stretcher.

144
00:17:33,352 --> 00:17:34,842
l'll cast my vote going
in a wheelchair.

145
00:17:35,054 --> 00:17:37,921
Excellent! Wheelchair to CM's chair!

146
00:17:38,824 --> 00:17:40,291
lt will cost you heavily sir.

147
00:17:40,492 --> 00:17:41,186
Why?

148
00:17:42,327 --> 00:17:44,727
There are people to kill
for Rs. 1 1 16 also,

149
00:17:45,230 --> 00:17:47,221
they will come from Bihar
to kill and then vanish.

150
00:17:47,900 --> 00:17:49,492
But if you want to survive the attack,

151
00:17:50,936 --> 00:17:52,096
we need professionals.

152
00:17:52,304 --> 00:17:53,669
Don't worry about money,

153
00:17:54,273 --> 00:17:55,399
get the best professional
in the market.

154
00:17:55,607 --> 00:17:58,201
No need to search for him,
he's here only.

155
00:17:58,877 --> 00:18:01,505
Yes sir, Hyderabad has
developed very much.

156
00:18:01,713 --> 00:18:03,180
We get anything we need here.

157
00:18:04,383 --> 00:18:05,407
Who is he?

158
00:18:25,037 --> 00:18:27,096
Not that...- He's here.

159
00:18:28,240 --> 00:18:29,502
What?
- For you sir!

160
00:18:32,277 --> 00:18:34,108
Hello...who is that?

161
00:18:34,313 --> 00:18:35,837
Farooq asked me to contact you.

162
00:18:36,748 --> 00:18:39,046
One minute...talk to him.

163
00:18:40,152 --> 00:18:43,315
Hello...l'm Baji Reddy...go ahead.

164
00:18:43,522 --> 00:18:44,546
Give the phone to Siva Reddy.

165
00:18:44,756 --> 00:18:46,383
We both are one and same.

166
00:18:46,725 --> 00:18:48,283
ls it okay if l kill you
instead of him?

167
00:18:50,562 --> 00:18:51,688
Good joke.

168
00:18:51,897 --> 00:18:53,023
l can shoot well too.

169
00:18:54,900 --> 00:18:56,367
Yes, that is what we want.

170
00:18:57,469 --> 00:18:59,198
Farooq must have told
you everything.

171
00:18:59,471 --> 00:19:02,531
You must make the kill
but the victim must not die.

172
00:19:03,075 --> 00:19:03,700
1 .5

173
00:19:03,909 --> 00:19:05,877
How much?- 1 .5 crores.

174
00:19:06,078 --> 00:19:09,878
Too much. Any concession?

175
00:19:10,082 --> 00:19:11,879
Shall l kill you as a concession?

176
00:19:13,085 --> 00:19:14,882
Oh no! Thank you.

177
00:19:15,254 --> 00:19:17,722
75 lakhs in advance & 75 lakhs
after finishing the job.

178
00:19:17,923 --> 00:19:19,220
lf l get caught after
finishing the job...?

179
00:19:19,424 --> 00:19:21,051
What if you cheat me...?

180
00:19:21,293 --> 00:19:23,887
l know only to kill
not to cheat.

181
00:19:24,096 --> 00:19:27,395
Okay. l'll give it in one shot.

182
00:19:28,100 --> 00:19:32,400
But it is a formality for us
to meet before the payment.

183
00:19:32,604 --> 00:19:33,571
Not necessary.

184
00:19:33,772 --> 00:19:36,070
lt is necessary for us.
We're giving you 1 .5 crores.

185
00:19:36,608 --> 00:19:38,735
Can't we atleast see your face?

186
00:19:38,944 --> 00:19:41,071
lf you want to see the gun,
nothing wrong.

187
00:19:41,647 --> 00:19:44,741
Want to see the bullet?
You'll be dead.

188
00:19:46,118 --> 00:19:48,416
The payment should be
in the denomination of 1000.

189
00:19:48,954 --> 00:19:52,583
Seal it in a plastic cover and
put it in a red color bag.

190
00:19:52,958 --> 00:19:56,917
Ask your man to take the
Begumpet local train by 9 pm.

191
00:19:57,129 --> 00:20:00,098
Tell him to keep the bag
below the seat & leave.

192
00:20:00,532 --> 00:20:02,261
Did he get down?- No sir.

193
00:20:02,968 --> 00:20:03,935
Keep watching.

194
00:20:04,536 --> 00:20:06,265
He'll get down with
our red color bag.

195
00:20:06,471 --> 00:20:09,269
Follow him, know his whereabouts
and inform me.- Okay sir.

196
00:20:11,476 --> 00:20:12,602
Sorry.- lts okay.

197
00:20:13,312 --> 00:20:15,280
What okay?- Nothing sir.

198
00:20:15,480 --> 00:20:16,447
l said okay to him.

199
00:20:16,815 --> 00:20:18,783
Saw him?- He is not the one.

200
00:20:19,151 --> 00:20:21,779
lf it is not him,
it must be someone else.

201
00:20:22,654 --> 00:20:26,784
You idiot! lt is 1 .5 crores.

202
00:20:26,992 --> 00:20:27,959
lt took me a day to count.

203
00:20:28,660 --> 00:20:29,627
Sir, the train is moving.

204
00:20:29,828 --> 00:20:32,126
Keep watching & it will go away.

205
00:20:32,331 --> 00:20:32,956
Yes sir.- Get into the train.

206
00:20:34,833 --> 00:20:39,793
ls the bag still there?
- Yes sir. But no money.

207
00:20:40,839 --> 00:20:44,639
He must have sat behind me
so that l won't be able to see him.

208
00:20:44,843 --> 00:20:45,810
He has taken the money.

209
00:21:00,058 --> 00:21:01,150
Were you reading a newspaper?

210
00:21:01,360 --> 00:21:02,327
How did you know that?

211
00:21:02,527 --> 00:21:03,323
Nothing new about it.

212
00:21:03,528 --> 00:21:04,825
You were reading the paper and
he walked away with the money.

213
00:21:05,063 --> 00:21:05,995
What do you want me to do now?

214
00:21:06,198 --> 00:21:08,166
Catch a train & finish reading
the remaining newspaper.

215
00:21:08,400 --> 00:21:10,334
Sir...- What?

216
00:21:11,737 --> 00:21:12,999
The bag is torn.

217
00:21:14,706 --> 00:21:16,333
No tension boy.

218
00:21:16,541 --> 00:21:18,168
Bring it here.
We'll get it stitched.

219
00:21:18,377 --> 00:21:24,009
Place of Siva Reddy's assassination...
night...time... (watch isn't working)

220
00:21:32,557 --> 00:21:34,525
l'll be in that building.
9th floor.

221
00:21:35,060 --> 00:21:37,187
Rent a car from some
unknown person.

222
00:21:38,230 --> 00:21:40,027
Look out for a new travel company.
- l need the license.

223
00:21:40,399 --> 00:21:41,525
Advance Rs. 10000.

224
00:21:51,243 --> 00:21:53,211
The meeting starts at 10:30 am
day after tomorrow.

225
00:21:53,412 --> 00:21:55,380
Wait on the road next
to the building.

226
00:22:19,604 --> 00:22:24,906
To crowd thronging the place,
my brothers and sisters,

227
00:22:25,110 --> 00:22:39,423
party men, district leaders, media
and police, thank you very much.

228
00:22:44,129 --> 00:22:50,261
We very well know how unhappy
you are with the present government.

229
00:22:50,469 --> 00:22:53,438
You paid interest for the
money borrowed by them.

230
00:22:53,638 --> 00:22:56,106
You paid taxes for their wrong doings.

231
00:23:03,148 --> 00:23:14,787
Hail Siva Reddy!

232
00:23:14,993 --> 00:23:19,794
l'm happy to say that Mr.Siva Reddy
will address you shortly.

233
00:23:28,507 --> 00:23:33,968
He is the glimmer of hope
for the minority community.

234
00:23:42,687 --> 00:24:00,368
Hail Siva Reddy!

235
00:24:21,560 --> 00:24:22,857
What will you do for my father?

236
00:24:23,395 --> 00:24:25,693
We'll make him our CM.

237
00:24:25,897 --> 00:24:27,694
Louder please.
Assembly must hear that!

238
00:24:27,899 --> 00:24:29,196
We'll make him our CM.

239
00:24:30,902 --> 00:24:32,870
Now father will address you.

240
00:24:39,244 --> 00:24:43,704
Today l see 2 Hussain Sagars here.

241
00:24:43,915 --> 00:24:45,883
One is flowing under
the tank bunk,

242
00:24:46,151 --> 00:24:48,051
l see the other one flowing here.

243
00:24:50,922 --> 00:24:53,550
When you whistle,
heroes are born.

244
00:24:53,758 --> 00:24:55,885
When you cast vote,
leaders are born.

245
00:24:57,929 --> 00:24:59,226
lf you support one
he becomes a Minister.

246
00:24:59,965 --> 00:25:01,057
Otherwise a wastrel.

247
00:25:03,435 --> 00:25:05,903
When you bless,
leaders live.

248
00:25:06,605 --> 00:25:08,402
When they become despots,
you crush them.

249
00:25:08,773 --> 00:25:11,742
You are the people but
in real mass upheaval.

250
00:25:16,615 --> 00:25:26,923
When you are with me,
no one can dare touch me.

251
00:25:27,325 --> 00:25:34,254
As long as you are with me,
no one can dare touch me.

252
00:25:46,811 --> 00:25:48,108
What happened?- Move.

253
00:25:52,817 --> 00:25:53,784
Call the doctor.

254
00:25:56,154 --> 00:25:57,451
Who killed my father?

255
00:26:22,847 --> 00:26:24,474
Calling control room.

256
00:26:24,583 --> 00:26:25,845
We need more force.

257
00:26:25,951 --> 00:26:26,576
Send it immediately.

258
00:26:26,785 --> 00:26:28,252
Come on, seal the North Block.

259
00:27:39,758 --> 00:27:41,385
250 policemen surrounding the building.

260
00:27:41,593 --> 00:27:43,891
Millions in the ground behind.

261
00:27:45,130 --> 00:27:46,563
So, you're left with only 2 options.

262
00:27:47,599 --> 00:27:50,227
Surrender or death.

263
00:27:51,803 --> 00:27:52,565
Which one do you prefer?

264
00:29:10,281 --> 00:29:12,249
Have it.- No thanks.

265
00:29:12,784 --> 00:29:13,910
lts alright, have it.
Tastes good.

266
00:29:18,456 --> 00:29:19,753
Where are you going?

267
00:29:21,292 --> 00:29:22,088
Where are you going?

268
00:29:26,798 --> 00:29:27,765
Undrajavaram.

269
00:29:28,800 --> 00:29:31,268
l'm going to Basarlapudi,
very famous village.

270
00:29:31,469 --> 00:29:32,265
But you wouldn't have known that.

271
00:29:37,509 --> 00:29:38,601
Do you think l saw that poster
and told you about that village?

272
00:29:40,512 --> 00:29:41,604
That poster is for me.

273
00:29:44,983 --> 00:29:45,779
Don't believe me?

274
00:29:46,651 --> 00:29:47,447
Just a minute...l'll show you.

275
00:29:58,396 --> 00:29:59,124
Pardhu...

276
00:29:59,998 --> 00:30:02,125
Sathyanarayana Murthy
is my grandfather.

277
00:30:02,667 --> 00:30:05,795
The great Basarlapudi, my village.

278
00:30:13,344 --> 00:30:16,802
l took this photo in our
village festival 12 years back.

279
00:30:19,184 --> 00:30:20,310
Forget it.

280
00:30:20,852 --> 00:30:22,319
That's how my fate runs.

281
00:30:22,520 --> 00:30:23,646
l always lose whatever l like.

282
00:30:24,189 --> 00:30:26,157
My parents died when l was a kid.

283
00:30:26,858 --> 00:30:29,326
l left from my grandfather
12 years back.

284
00:30:30,862 --> 00:30:31,829
That's why l'm returning home.

285
00:30:34,432 --> 00:30:39,335
All these 12 years, l was working
for a contractor in Gujarat.

286
00:30:40,538 --> 00:30:42,665
When l came to Hyderabad,
l saw these posters here.

287
00:30:42,907 --> 00:30:43,999
l was surprised.

288
00:30:44,709 --> 00:30:46,836
They are searching me
for the past 12 years,

289
00:30:47,545 --> 00:30:48,842
it means they still remember me.

290
00:30:49,547 --> 00:30:53,847
l felt bad for making them
suffer all these years.

291
00:30:55,053 --> 00:30:57,681
So, l sent a telegram saying
that l'm coming.

292
00:30:58,723 --> 00:31:00,520
By now, everyone must
be eager to see me.

293
00:31:05,396 --> 00:31:07,694
For the first time, l thought flight to
my village would be very good.

294
00:31:07,899 --> 00:31:09,366
l could go reach faster.

295
00:31:14,572 --> 00:31:19,874
Gudivada...Narsapur Express
running 20 minutes late...

296
00:31:22,747 --> 00:31:24,374
Boy, which station is this?
- Railway station.

297
00:31:25,083 --> 00:31:25,549
Gudivada.

298
00:31:27,252 --> 00:31:29,379
People say, you won't get
sleep if you drink coffee.

299
00:31:29,587 --> 00:31:31,555
But l fall asleep as
soon as l've a coffee.

300
00:31:31,756 --> 00:31:32,552
Would you like to have coffee?

301
00:31:32,757 --> 00:31:33,724
l think you're joking.

302
00:31:35,627 --> 00:31:37,720
2 coffees please.

303
00:31:39,964 --> 00:31:41,397
Don't disturb the passengers.

304
00:31:46,304 --> 00:31:48,067
lt's him. The brown jacket.

305
00:31:59,784 --> 00:32:00,751
l've biscuits in my bag.

306
00:32:00,952 --> 00:32:02,078
They would taste great with coffee.

307
00:32:06,624 --> 00:32:07,750
Shit! l missed.

308
00:32:08,459 --> 00:32:11,257
Quick! Round up the compartment.
He mustn't escape!

309
00:32:25,310 --> 00:32:26,106
Calling all stations.

310
00:32:26,411 --> 00:32:27,435
The killer has escaped.

311
00:32:27,645 --> 00:32:29,442
Alert all stations.

312
00:32:48,833 --> 00:32:49,629
Careful dad.

313
00:32:50,835 --> 00:32:51,631
Wow!

314
00:32:53,004 --> 00:32:53,800
You put it?

315
00:32:54,839 --> 00:32:56,466
You won't even add salt to food.

316
00:32:56,708 --> 00:32:57,970
But you've decorated
the street with Rangoli.

317
00:32:58,176 --> 00:33:00,303
My fiance Pardhu is coming.

318
00:33:03,848 --> 00:33:04,974
WELCOME should be
on the other side.

319
00:33:06,017 --> 00:33:06,984
Yes dad.

320
00:33:08,386 --> 00:33:10,149
She has written WELCOME
in the opposite direction.

321
00:33:10,855 --> 00:33:11,822
lts alright.

322
00:33:12,023 --> 00:33:12,990
lf it is written in that
direction, it means,

323
00:33:13,191 --> 00:33:14,818
''we feel happy on your arrival''.

324
00:33:15,193 --> 00:33:16,160
lf it is in this direction, it means,

325
00:33:16,361 --> 00:33:18,329
''we feel very happy
for your departure''.

326
00:33:18,863 --> 00:33:19,329
lsn't it?

327
00:33:19,697 --> 00:33:21,995
lnstead of writing WELCOME,
BYE would do, huh?

328
00:33:23,201 --> 00:33:24,998
Your father hasn't understood
this concept yet?

329
00:33:25,870 --> 00:33:26,837
Where are you going?

330
00:33:27,038 --> 00:33:28,665
To receive Pardhu.

331
00:33:29,040 --> 00:33:29,665
How will you recognize him?

332
00:33:29,874 --> 00:33:30,841
He would be a young man now.

333
00:33:31,042 --> 00:33:32,839
She's right.
- He will recognize us. Let's go.

334
00:33:33,044 --> 00:33:34,511
But you've grown old.

335
00:33:35,213 --> 00:33:37,841
Oh god! You gave me a Question bank
instead of a daughter.

336
00:33:38,716 --> 00:33:39,182
Come.

337
00:34:21,793 --> 00:34:25,729
You...Pardhu?

338
00:34:27,765 --> 00:34:29,892
Mom, brother-in-law has come.

339
00:34:30,435 --> 00:34:31,402
Mom...

340
00:34:32,270 --> 00:34:33,567
Why are you shouting?

341
00:34:33,771 --> 00:34:34,738
Pardhu has come.

342
00:34:34,939 --> 00:34:37,066
Mom, my fiance has come.

343
00:34:37,442 --> 00:34:39,239
Lalitha, hold this. Careful.

344
00:34:39,444 --> 00:34:40,570
He is very tall.

345
00:34:40,945 --> 00:34:42,572
He is taller than me.

346
00:34:45,450 --> 00:34:46,246
Your aunt.

347
00:34:46,451 --> 00:34:47,076
Didn't recognize her?

348
00:34:51,956 --> 00:34:54,925
Pardhu, where were you
all these days?

349
00:34:57,295 --> 00:34:58,421
He is like his father.

350
00:34:59,630 --> 00:35:02,758
Did you ever wanted to see
us all these years?

351
00:35:02,967 --> 00:35:04,594
We were eagerly waiting for you.

352
00:35:06,971 --> 00:35:07,938
We are very happy now.

353
00:35:08,306 --> 00:35:10,103
Thank god you've come back.

354
00:35:10,808 --> 00:35:11,775
Why don't you say something?

355
00:35:12,310 --> 00:35:13,709
Come Pardhu.

356
00:35:19,617 --> 00:35:22,085
Ward off evil eyes.
- Give it to me.

357
00:35:30,528 --> 00:35:31,790
Why are you standing there?

358
00:35:31,996 --> 00:35:34,123
Come...come here.

359
00:35:35,166 --> 00:35:36,292
She is very shy.

360
00:35:38,336 --> 00:35:39,963
Can't you recognize her? Poori.

361
00:35:40,505 --> 00:35:42,632
Throw it outside.

362
00:35:42,874 --> 00:35:43,636
Come.

363
00:35:50,181 --> 00:35:52,649
l meant the threshold
not the kitchen.

364
00:36:02,527 --> 00:36:04,995
Your mom brought this idol of Rama
from her parents' home.

365
00:36:06,030 --> 00:36:09,158
Happiness or sorrows,
she shared them with him.

366
00:36:09,534 --> 00:36:12,992
She says Lord Rama will
listen to her prayers.

367
00:36:13,538 --> 00:36:16,166
Now that she is in heaven
with Lord Rama,

368
00:36:17,041 --> 00:36:20,010
anything we say to Lord Rama
is saying to your mother.

369
00:36:20,711 --> 00:36:23,509
That's why l brought you here.

370
00:36:26,384 --> 00:36:28,352
Sister-in-law, your Pardhu has come.

371
00:37:01,919 --> 00:37:02,715
Father...

372
00:37:04,822 --> 00:37:05,379
Pardhu...

373
00:37:56,641 --> 00:37:59,269
He has come back home
after so many years.

374
00:37:59,477 --> 00:38:00,944
But you haven't spoken a word.

375
00:38:01,479 --> 00:38:03,947
l've been waiting for him
for the past 12 years.

376
00:38:05,149 --> 00:38:09,449
Can't he wait 10 more
minutes for me to talk?

377
00:38:10,821 --> 00:38:11,947
May be he is hungry.

378
00:38:12,490 --> 00:38:15,288
Give him something to eat. Go.

379
00:38:29,674 --> 00:38:31,301
Couldn't you bring better bananas?

380
00:38:31,509 --> 00:38:33,477
What are they coming for?
To see the girl or bananas?

381
00:38:33,678 --> 00:38:35,145
You talk too much.

382
00:38:38,516 --> 00:38:40,643
Greetings. - Greetings.

383
00:38:42,520 --> 00:38:43,646
Greetings.- Greetings.

384
00:38:43,854 --> 00:38:45,651
Why did you get up?
Please sit down.

385
00:38:45,856 --> 00:38:47,983
We are bride's people,
we've to respect the groom's people.

386
00:38:48,192 --> 00:38:49,318
lt's impossible to talk to him.

387
00:38:54,198 --> 00:38:55,825
Bujji, go & get betel leaves.- Okay.

388
00:38:56,033 --> 00:38:57,159
Want to ask her anything?

389
00:39:01,872 --> 00:39:03,169
Tell your girl to ask
him something.

390
00:39:04,375 --> 00:39:06,172
She is very innocent girl.

391
00:39:07,044 --> 00:39:10,343
Send her to our house and
we'll teach her everything.

392
00:39:20,224 --> 00:39:21,191
lt's alright sit.

393
00:39:24,061 --> 00:39:25,028
Why have you come here?

394
00:39:25,730 --> 00:39:26,856
Bride seeing ceremony is over there.

395
00:39:27,064 --> 00:39:27,689
So...?

396
00:39:28,065 --> 00:39:29,532
Grow up Pardhu.

397
00:39:30,234 --> 00:39:31,861
l didn't mean growing taller.

398
00:39:32,069 --> 00:39:33,866
l meant the mental growth.

399
00:39:39,577 --> 00:39:40,544
Take it.

400
00:39:44,648 --> 00:39:45,876
Considers herself a princess!

401
00:39:46,250 --> 00:39:49,879
Consider you go to buy
an Ambassador Car.

402
00:39:50,421 --> 00:39:51,547
There is a Benz car next to it.

403
00:39:51,789 --> 00:39:52,551
Which one will you buy?

404
00:39:57,094 --> 00:39:58,391
Consider you go to
buy a portable TV.

405
00:39:58,929 --> 00:40:03,229
There is a big....- Plasma.

406
00:40:04,435 --> 00:40:05,402
There is a plasma TV next to it.

407
00:40:06,270 --> 00:40:06,895
Which one will you buy?

408
00:40:10,274 --> 00:40:11,241
My sister is an Ambassador.

409
00:40:11,942 --> 00:40:12,909
l'm the Benz car.

410
00:40:13,778 --> 00:40:15,075
She is portable TV.

411
00:40:16,280 --> 00:40:17,577
l'm a plasma TV.

412
00:40:18,949 --> 00:40:20,075
She is a Lifebouy soap.

413
00:40:20,818 --> 00:40:21,910
l'm a Lux soap.

414
00:40:24,922 --> 00:40:28,085
My beauty shouldn't
hamper her chances.

415
00:40:28,292 --> 00:40:29,418
That's why l came here.

416
00:40:31,796 --> 00:40:33,593
Once she gets married,

417
00:40:34,298 --> 00:40:39,429
l will get a Hritik Roshan
or a Abhishek Bachchan.

418
00:40:41,972 --> 00:40:44,941
Even you're unable to
turn your eyes off me.

419
00:40:49,480 --> 00:40:53,280
Oh god! Why did you make
me so beautiful?

420
00:41:00,491 --> 00:41:01,458
Don't worry Poori.

421
00:41:02,326 --> 00:41:04,453
Your parents are
worried unnecessarily.

422
00:41:05,496 --> 00:41:06,622
You're not so beautiful.

423
00:41:10,167 --> 00:41:11,634
Your eyes aren't so big.

424
00:41:12,670 --> 00:41:16,128
Your nose is dented
as if punched by someone.

425
00:41:17,341 --> 00:41:18,638
You're not so fair.

426
00:41:19,844 --> 00:41:20,640
Then, why should they worry?

427
00:41:20,845 --> 00:41:21,971
You mean, l'm not beautiful.

428
00:41:22,513 --> 00:41:24,981
You think you look beautiful,
because they say so.

429
00:41:31,522 --> 00:41:35,481
Everyone will say Benz is beautiful
but people buy only Ambassador.

430
00:41:37,695 --> 00:41:38,821
Believe me.

431
00:41:39,196 --> 00:41:40,493
Just go down happily.

432
00:41:41,031 --> 00:41:42,328
Let me see who says
you're beautiful.

433
00:41:42,700 --> 00:41:45,328
Pardhu, take a look again and say...

434
00:41:51,542 --> 00:41:53,009
Someone broke it with a ball.

435
00:42:02,219 --> 00:42:03,015
What happened?

436
00:42:05,389 --> 00:42:06,014
What is it?

437
00:42:08,225 --> 00:42:11,524
She says ldly is good but
the chutney is horrible.

438
00:42:13,898 --> 00:42:15,024
l see.

439
00:42:15,399 --> 00:42:17,697
She says chilly powder would do.

440
00:42:18,736 --> 00:42:19,532
No...?

441
00:42:19,737 --> 00:42:20,362
Keep quiet.

442
00:42:20,604 --> 00:42:23,539
lt is not about ldlies or chutney.
Am l right?

443
00:42:24,808 --> 00:42:25,706
ln the upstairs...

444
00:42:26,911 --> 00:42:28,538
l'll tell them.

445
00:42:29,079 --> 00:42:31,047
The power went off when she
was watching TV upstairs.

446
00:42:31,248 --> 00:42:32,215
''When you can conduct
such big functions,

447
00:42:32,416 --> 00:42:34,543
can't you afford to rent
a generator'', she says.

448
00:42:35,920 --> 00:42:36,716
l ate.

449
00:42:36,921 --> 00:42:39,048
Oh my god! - Headache?

450
00:42:39,757 --> 00:42:40,382
What happened?

451
00:42:41,425 --> 00:42:42,392
Ear pain?

452
00:42:42,593 --> 00:42:43,389
What happened?

453
00:42:43,928 --> 00:42:45,054
Neck pain.

454
00:42:46,263 --> 00:42:46,786
No...?

455
00:42:47,264 --> 00:42:48,060
What happened?

456
00:42:48,265 --> 00:42:48,890
l'll tell you.

457
00:42:50,100 --> 00:42:52,227
Pardhu said she is not beautiful.

458
00:42:52,436 --> 00:42:54,734
ls Poori not beautiful?

459
00:42:58,275 --> 00:43:01,244
Don't worry brother.
l'll handle the matter.

460
00:43:07,618 --> 00:43:08,744
ls Poori not beautiful?

461
00:43:09,320 --> 00:43:10,412
ls her mother beautiful?

462
00:43:10,621 --> 00:43:11,417
ls her aunt beautiful?

463
00:43:11,956 --> 00:43:12,923
Aren't we living with them?

464
00:43:13,457 --> 00:43:14,082
And you...?

465
00:43:18,963 --> 00:43:19,759
What does he say?

466
00:43:20,464 --> 00:43:21,931
He wants to know our demands.

467
00:43:24,301 --> 00:43:25,598
Ask him to apologize to her.

468
00:43:44,488 --> 00:43:45,455
What's your problem?

469
00:43:45,656 --> 00:43:46,953
Everyone says she is beautiful.

470
00:43:47,157 --> 00:43:47,623
But you say she is not.

471
00:43:47,825 --> 00:43:48,792
Who is wrong, you or her?

472
00:43:48,993 --> 00:43:50,187
Us.- Shut up.

473
00:43:51,662 --> 00:43:52,788
Apologize my boy.

474
00:43:53,397 --> 00:43:56,127
We are not going to give up.
- Let me talk to him.

475
00:43:56,333 --> 00:43:59,894
What will you talk?
- They are talking as they like.

476
00:44:00,104 --> 00:44:04,063
Stop it....stop it.
Why are you shouting?

477
00:44:04,274 --> 00:44:05,366
He is a brilliant boy,

478
00:44:05,576 --> 00:44:08,477
even before marriage, he understood
that girls are not beautiful.

479
00:44:08,846 --> 00:44:10,313
What l mean to say is,

480
00:44:10,514 --> 00:44:12,141
this is not just Poori's problem.

481
00:44:12,349 --> 00:44:13,475
lt is a problem to
the womanhood.

482
00:44:13,784 --> 00:44:18,221
Neither boy Pardhu nor
a scholar like me can solve it.

483
00:44:18,422 --> 00:44:20,982
So, l'm leaving it to god.
- What?

484
00:44:21,191 --> 00:44:24,490
l'll count to 3.
When l say 3,

485
00:44:24,695 --> 00:44:28,153
if it rains, it means
women are beautiful.

486
00:44:29,033 --> 00:44:30,159
lf it does not rain...?

487
00:44:31,268 --> 00:44:32,599
This is cheating.
- What?

488
00:44:32,803 --> 00:44:33,827
We won't agree.
- Why?

489
00:44:34,038 --> 00:44:36,336
The rain must come from the sky.
Counting 3 is very short.

490
00:44:36,540 --> 00:44:38,007
Do you want me to
count to 3 million?

491
00:44:38,208 --> 00:44:39,675
l'm very poor in maths.

492
00:44:39,877 --> 00:44:41,208
l can't count more than that.

493
00:44:44,748 --> 00:44:54,714
i Dream.

494
00:45:09,306 --> 00:45:12,867
Gentle mischievous breeze
pinched the maiden's body...

495
00:45:13,077 --> 00:45:15,238
Black clouds are thundering...

496
00:45:24,354 --> 00:45:28,381
And chase with angry lightning...

497
00:45:29,026 --> 00:45:32,393
The shores have melted...

498
00:45:32,763 --> 00:45:35,960
Flowed in spate...

499
00:45:36,166 --> 00:45:39,727
ln our village...
in our courtyards...

500
00:45:40,304 --> 00:45:43,273
A thousand myriad hues...

501
00:45:43,507 --> 00:45:45,668
The beautiful gentle rain...

502
00:45:45,876 --> 00:45:50,040
Falling at the time
of happy moments...

503
00:45:50,581 --> 00:45:57,817
Even the moon of the sky will
descend here to be part of it...

504
00:46:49,406 --> 00:46:56,312
To reveal the secrets
behind the silence...

505
00:46:56,580 --> 00:46:59,447
Calling you with affection...

506
00:46:59,817 --> 00:47:02,047
With a bang in your heart...

507
00:47:02,252 --> 00:47:06,416
lt's a rollicking foot tapping music...

508
00:47:24,908 --> 00:47:28,344
Turning the bliss into
moments of wonder...

509
00:47:28,579 --> 00:47:31,639
Won't it melt away the time?

510
00:47:32,216 --> 00:47:35,583
ln the lap of the
magical moments...

511
00:47:35,819 --> 00:47:39,050
Won't it make you forget years?

512
00:47:39,256 --> 00:47:42,851
Festoon of stars will
light our home...

513
00:47:43,060 --> 00:47:46,359
Shining bright like
a pearl chain...

514
00:47:46,563 --> 00:47:48,588
Spreading the fragrance
of sandalwood...

515
00:47:48,899 --> 00:47:52,926
Turning our courtyard into
a garden of flowers...

516
00:48:44,021 --> 00:48:47,354
Tune of happiness in
the rhythm of smiles...

517
00:48:47,557 --> 00:48:50,924
Speed of light in the flowers...

518
00:48:51,128 --> 00:48:54,256
Where was it all these years?

519
00:48:54,464 --> 00:48:56,796
This choral music...

520
00:48:57,000 --> 00:49:01,096
Spread it's charm now only...

521
00:49:19,589 --> 00:49:26,427
Happiness spread around
as fun and frolic...

522
00:49:26,697 --> 00:49:33,796
New tunes of bliss are playing
here like fresh first rains...

523
00:49:34,004 --> 00:49:40,967
The fun and frolic is
touching the sky...

524
00:49:41,178 --> 00:49:47,913
lt's music of love and
affection all over here...

525
00:50:05,869 --> 00:50:09,498
CBl Office...Hyderabad.
....Old man's room...

526
00:50:09,706 --> 00:50:12,004
Why watch movies early
morning instead of studying?

527
00:50:12,209 --> 00:50:14,507
Okay, l'll find out.

528
00:50:16,046 --> 00:50:17,013
How many films...?

529
00:50:17,214 --> 00:50:18,841
l'm trying to find out the answer.

530
00:50:19,383 --> 00:50:21,010
How many films did Krishna act?

531
00:50:23,220 --> 00:50:27,020
Krishnarjuna Yudham,
Krishna thulabaram,...

532
00:50:27,391 --> 00:50:30,792
The question is not how many films
NTR played Lord Krishna's role.

533
00:50:31,628 --> 00:50:34,461
How many films did
Super star Krishna act?

534
00:50:36,066 --> 00:50:37,294
Around 300 films.

535
00:50:37,501 --> 00:50:39,366
l want the exact figure.

536
00:50:41,405 --> 00:50:42,030
Why?

537
00:50:42,305 --> 00:50:43,863
What bothers you?

538
00:50:44,241 --> 00:50:46,038
My grand daughter is
answering a TV quiz.

539
00:50:48,311 --> 00:50:50,871
l'll find it from some
intelligent person.

540
00:50:51,915 --> 00:50:54,543
Can't you know such simple things?

541
00:50:54,918 --> 00:50:55,714
Why have you come here?

542
00:50:56,586 --> 00:50:57,883
He said you called for me.

543
00:50:58,422 --> 00:51:01,391
Siva Reddy murder case has
been entrusted to us.

544
00:51:03,427 --> 00:51:04,894
Must be dealt very carefully.

545
00:51:06,763 --> 00:51:09,732
Would 2 or 3 days be enough
for you to investigate?

546
00:51:14,271 --> 00:51:15,966
l need 4 or 5 days to read this.

547
00:51:17,007 --> 00:51:18,975
lf you need 4 or 5 days to read this,

548
00:51:19,443 --> 00:51:21,843
how many days will you need
to understand what you read,

549
00:51:22,045 --> 00:51:24,912
how many days will you need to
investigate what you understood,

550
00:51:25,115 --> 00:51:28,642
and how many years will you need
to prepare the investigation report?

551
00:51:29,286 --> 00:51:30,753
l'm not trying to confuse you.

552
00:51:35,692 --> 00:51:36,659
l'll do it.

553
00:51:44,801 --> 00:51:45,529
What is it dear?

554
00:51:46,303 --> 00:51:48,362
Kamal Hasan's first wife's name?

555
00:51:48,638 --> 00:51:50,765
l'm sending 2 men.
They'll tell you.

556
00:51:51,475 --> 00:51:53,443
Your general knowledge is zero. Go.

557
00:51:57,914 --> 00:51:59,438
Hello, it's me.

558
00:51:59,816 --> 00:52:02,114
Find out which TV channel
my grand daughter is watching,

559
00:52:02,486 --> 00:52:04,283
file a case against the
channel & close it down.

560
00:52:04,488 --> 00:52:06,115
Silly questions? ldiot.

561
00:52:08,992 --> 00:52:11,426
Hi Pardhu! How are you?
- lt has been very long since we met.

562
00:52:11,628 --> 00:52:13,858
When did you arrive?
- l saw you when you were a kid.

563
00:52:14,064 --> 00:52:15,793
You've grown very tall.
- l knew you will come.

564
00:52:15,999 --> 00:52:18,160
l've informed all and he too
and brought him here.

565
00:52:21,404 --> 00:52:29,641
l still know your tastes.
Fish curry. Mutton curry.

566
00:52:35,185 --> 00:52:37,153
You finish it off.
Till then l'll wait outside.

567
00:52:37,354 --> 00:52:37,820
No thanks.

568
00:52:38,021 --> 00:52:39,648
You talk. l'll stand outside.

569
00:52:39,856 --> 00:52:41,483
You told me about his arrival.

570
00:52:41,691 --> 00:52:42,817
So, you talk.- No thanks.

571
00:52:43,026 --> 00:52:44,994
lt was Giri who told me
about your arrival.

572
00:52:45,362 --> 00:52:48,160
l'm not in a hurry.
Talk to him first. l'll go out.

573
00:52:48,431 --> 00:52:50,922
Giri stop.
- He is a big nonsense.

574
00:52:51,134 --> 00:52:52,829
You can't stop him
once he starts.

575
00:52:53,870 --> 00:52:54,666
Atleast you tell him.

576
00:52:56,206 --> 00:53:01,838
Wow! He remembers our names.
-You are right.

577
00:53:02,045 --> 00:53:04,843
That's friendship.
You're fit for nothing.

578
00:53:05,715 --> 00:53:09,515
Pardhu, you haven't changed.
- He grew little taller.

579
00:53:12,389 --> 00:53:14,186
You finish.- No, you talk.

580
00:53:15,058 --> 00:53:20,519
After you left the village,
l stopped eating dinner.

581
00:53:20,730 --> 00:53:23,528
Didn't doctor advice you to skip
dinner to reduce your weight?

582
00:53:25,735 --> 00:53:27,532
Just pour your feelings.
l'll stand outside.

583
00:53:27,737 --> 00:53:29,705
Okay. l won't talk. Happy?

584
00:53:30,807 --> 00:53:33,776
So, what's hot, Pardhu?
-You tell me.

585
00:53:34,578 --> 00:53:36,705
Our villagers have got
settled in different places.

586
00:53:37,247 --> 00:53:40,045
Good in studies have become teachers
and others started new schools.

587
00:53:40,250 --> 00:53:41,717
lntelligent are doing
finance business.

588
00:53:41,918 --> 00:53:43,647
Foolish are paying interest
to do agriculture.

589
00:53:44,421 --> 00:53:46,446
Let's go out to have
a smoke and tea.

590
00:53:46,923 --> 00:53:48,220
Just a minute. l'll inform my aunt.

591
00:53:48,425 --> 00:53:51,053
Cigarettes for her? Not necessary.

592
00:53:51,428 --> 00:53:52,725
l'll atleast inform her
about having coffee.

593
00:53:52,963 --> 00:53:53,895
Okay then.

594
00:54:06,776 --> 00:54:08,073
Sambar is tasteless.

595
00:54:09,613 --> 00:54:10,580
Hey boy, change the glass.

596
00:54:10,780 --> 00:54:12,247
He has mistaken water
for sambar.

597
00:54:13,850 --> 00:54:15,078
lt's been very long since we came here.

598
00:54:15,285 --> 00:54:16,081
Do you owe money
to this shopkeeper?

599
00:54:25,295 --> 00:54:29,755
Have you ever felt sad about Shekar?

600
00:54:30,800 --> 00:54:34,258
But l felt many times that
we committed a grave mistake.

601
00:54:34,537 --> 00:54:35,435
Why dig the past?

602
00:54:35,639 --> 00:54:37,266
What he did was wrong?

603
00:54:37,474 --> 00:54:38,270
You could've advised him then.

604
00:54:38,475 --> 00:54:40,943
l was only 10 then.
- He was also 10.

605
00:54:41,478 --> 00:54:44,447
Whatever it is, what you did was wrong.

606
00:54:44,648 --> 00:54:45,444
What did he do?

607
00:54:48,652 --> 00:54:52,110
Waging life...at the age of 10.
ls it right?

608
00:54:52,322 --> 00:54:55,291
Whose life? Who waged?
Who was 10 years old?

609
00:54:55,492 --> 00:54:56,959
l'm not giving you any information.

610
00:54:57,160 --> 00:54:57,956
l'm talking about my feeling.

611
00:54:58,161 --> 00:54:59,128
Why do you feel?

612
00:54:59,329 --> 00:55:01,297
Because it is an incident to feel.

613
00:55:01,498 --> 00:55:02,123
What was the incident?

614
00:55:02,999 --> 00:55:04,967
Why are you scratching old wounds?

615
00:55:05,835 --> 00:55:07,632
Who scratched? What wound?

616
00:55:07,837 --> 00:55:09,964
lt happened 12 years ago.

617
00:55:10,173 --> 00:55:11,800
What happened?

618
00:55:12,008 --> 00:55:13,976
lt's an unforgivable sin.

619
00:55:14,177 --> 00:55:14,643
Hey...

620
00:55:15,712 --> 00:55:17,304
Then, why did you talk about it then?

621
00:55:17,514 --> 00:55:19,812
When l was busy eating
the burnt stuff,

622
00:55:20,016 --> 00:55:24,851
who tortured me like a belly dancer
showing little and covering little?

623
00:55:26,856 --> 00:55:27,823
Tell me what happened?

624
00:55:28,191 --> 00:55:29,158
Tell me what is happening?

625
00:55:29,359 --> 00:55:30,485
Tell me what will happen?

626
00:55:31,194 --> 00:55:32,320
l want to know that now.

627
00:55:33,196 --> 00:55:35,323
l must know.
l must know about it.

628
00:55:35,699 --> 00:55:36,495
Tell him.

629
00:55:38,868 --> 00:55:39,334
No.

630
00:55:39,869 --> 00:55:41,166
He'll say his version
like a lawyer.

631
00:55:41,371 --> 00:55:42,838
l'll say like a judge
acceptable to all.

632
00:55:43,039 --> 00:55:44,666
Whatever it is,
tell it on my face.

633
00:55:46,042 --> 00:55:47,009
12 years back,

634
00:55:47,377 --> 00:55:48,503
in this village,

635
00:55:48,712 --> 00:55:52,512
myself, Pardhu, Giri & priest's son
Shekar were studying 5th std.

636
00:55:52,882 --> 00:55:56,340
One day Pardhu teased
Shekar as coward.

637
00:55:56,619 --> 00:55:57,847
Shekar objected to it.

638
00:55:58,054 --> 00:56:00,022
So, Pardhu challenged
him to a bet.

639
00:56:00,223 --> 00:56:02,691
Visit cemetery at 12 midnight,

640
00:56:02,892 --> 00:56:03,358
l will agree that you're
not a coward.

641
00:56:03,560 --> 00:56:04,686
l will go. l'm not scared.

642
00:56:04,894 --> 00:56:08,352
Okay. We'll keep 4 lemons
on Peer Sahib's grave in the afternoon.

643
00:56:08,565 --> 00:56:09,532
You must bring them
back at night.

644
00:56:09,733 --> 00:56:10,529
Okay sure.

645
00:56:10,734 --> 00:56:12,201
We insisted not to go.

646
00:56:12,402 --> 00:56:15,371
But Pardhu went to Shekar's
house & woke him up.

647
00:56:15,772 --> 00:56:19,367
Shekar alone went to
the cemetery in the night.

648
00:56:19,576 --> 00:56:24,036
He took 3 out of 4 lemons
which we had kept there.

649
00:56:24,781 --> 00:56:26,373
While taking the 4th one,

650
00:56:26,916 --> 00:56:29,043
he felt like someone
pulling him from behind.

651
00:56:29,252 --> 00:56:32,551
He thought it was a ghost.
And his heart stopped beating.

652
00:56:32,922 --> 00:56:34,549
Next morning we saw
it was branch of a tree.

653
00:56:35,992 --> 00:56:37,550
Fear is worse than ghost.

654
00:56:37,927 --> 00:56:38,552
Where is Pardhu?

655
00:56:41,931 --> 00:56:43,899
Sharma hasn't come
out of the shock yet.

656
00:56:44,100 --> 00:56:46,227
You know Shailaja, right?
Shekar's sister.

657
00:56:46,436 --> 00:56:48,404
She was taken to hospital
recently finding difficult to breath.

658
00:56:48,605 --> 00:56:49,731
Doctors said she has
a hole in the heart.

659
00:56:49,939 --> 00:56:52,066
Operation would cost 2 lakhs.

660
00:56:52,275 --> 00:56:54,573
Sharma trusts his god
for everything.

661
00:56:55,111 --> 00:56:59,241
How will god help him
when he's dependent on priest?

662
00:56:59,783 --> 00:57:01,580
Would you like to eat? No.

663
00:57:01,785 --> 00:57:05,585
People come to this
temple to offer prayers,

664
00:57:05,789 --> 00:57:07,586
but never offer anything to god.
Worst fellows.

665
00:57:12,295 --> 00:57:13,421
Shall we go to his house once?

666
00:57:19,469 --> 00:57:20,265
Excuse me sir...

667
00:57:21,304 --> 00:57:22,601
Who is that?

668
00:57:24,974 --> 00:57:26,271
We were on the way to Rajamundry

669
00:57:26,476 --> 00:57:27,943
We had a flat tyre.

670
00:57:28,144 --> 00:57:30,112
Oh no! There is no shop around.

671
00:57:30,647 --> 00:57:32,274
lt's alright.
We will go pushing the car.

672
00:57:34,184 --> 00:57:37,449
Could you please give some water?
- Just a minute.

673
00:57:37,654 --> 00:57:39,952
Also bring something to eat.

674
00:57:45,328 --> 00:57:47,626
We came here to help & not to eat.

675
00:57:47,831 --> 00:57:49,958
Then, tell them that you're Pardhu.

676
00:57:50,166 --> 00:57:51,463
Why lie to them?

677
00:57:51,668 --> 00:57:53,465
l want to help them rather
than telling them the truth.

678
00:57:54,170 --> 00:57:56,968
Help? lt is no child's play?

679
00:57:57,173 --> 00:57:58,640
lt is a heart surgery.- l know.

680
00:57:59,509 --> 00:58:01,807
Do trees in your house bear
money instead of fruits?

681
00:58:02,011 --> 00:58:03,478
ls it not enough if trees in
this house bears money?

682
00:58:08,852 --> 00:58:09,978
What is that?- Money.

683
00:58:10,687 --> 00:58:12,154
Money? How much?

684
00:58:12,355 --> 00:58:14,323
3 lakhs. - 3 lakhs...!?

685
00:58:15,191 --> 00:58:15,987
lsn't that enough?

686
00:58:16,192 --> 00:58:17,159
Have you got it like that?

687
00:58:19,195 --> 00:58:20,662
You threw 3 lakhs
for a hibiscus plant.

688
00:58:20,864 --> 00:58:21,990
Had it been a banana tree,
would you've thrown 5 lakhs?

689
00:58:23,867 --> 00:58:25,334
There is nothing inside.

690
00:58:25,768 --> 00:58:28,168
Just some sweetmeat
offered to the god.

691
00:58:28,371 --> 00:58:31,829
Do you've to feel so bad to say that?
l like it very much.

692
00:58:33,109 --> 00:58:35,168
lt would be handy on
our way back.

693
00:58:35,378 --> 00:58:36,345
lt's alright take it.

694
00:58:37,714 --> 00:58:38,681
Okay.

695
00:58:39,215 --> 00:58:40,842
Let's go.- Just a minute.

696
00:58:41,885 --> 00:58:46,845
lf you don't mistake me,
let me tell you something.

697
00:58:47,056 --> 00:58:48,023
Please.

698
00:58:48,224 --> 00:58:50,749
Ask Aunty to offer prayers
everyday to the Holy Basil plant.

699
00:58:50,960 --> 00:58:51,892
She offers prayers everyday.

700
00:58:52,095 --> 00:58:54,825
Not just prayers, tell her to
offer Hibiscus flowers too.

701
00:58:55,031 --> 00:58:56,692
lt'll give boons...- Come.

702
00:58:57,066 --> 00:58:59,660
Okay.- Tell her to
clean the place too.

703
00:58:59,869 --> 00:59:03,703
There's lot of....dust...

704
00:59:04,240 --> 00:59:06,834
Don't forget to clean it.

705
00:59:16,019 --> 00:59:16,917
Where is he?

706
00:59:26,029 --> 00:59:30,591
Do you know Lord Rama & Hanuman
visited priest's home last night?

707
00:59:30,967 --> 00:59:34,801
Surprised? lt's you the Rama sans
Seetha and l the Hanuman sans tail.

708
00:59:35,138 --> 00:59:38,596
l know that we can gamble & drink
for 6 months if we've Rs.3 lakhs.

709
00:59:38,775 --> 00:59:41,471
Now l know we can take Lord Rama
to priest Sharma's home.

710
00:59:42,045 --> 00:59:43,034
Why are you silent?

711
00:59:43,513 --> 00:59:44,673
God shouldn't be dull.

712
00:59:46,449 --> 00:59:47,381
l'm not a god.

713
00:59:49,519 --> 00:59:51,282
l'm not even an ordinary
human like you.

714
00:59:52,388 --> 00:59:54,117
Thank god didn't say
you weren't Pardhu.

715
00:59:55,291 --> 00:59:58,021
Yes...l'm not Pardhu.

716
01:00:00,463 --> 01:00:01,191
What?

717
01:00:27,657 --> 01:00:30,285
lf you weren't Pardhu,
why did you give money to Sharma?

718
01:00:30,526 --> 01:00:33,256
Because Pardhu was
responsible for their misery.

719
01:00:35,598 --> 01:00:38,431
lf you weren't Murthy's grandson,
why did you come to this village?

720
01:00:40,069 --> 01:00:42,594
l was responsible
for Pardhu's death.

721
01:00:43,473 --> 01:00:47,409
Little confusing but
l've understood it.

722
01:00:50,980 --> 01:00:55,007
One last question.

723
01:00:55,251 --> 01:00:58,015
lf you didn't kill Siva Reddy,
why don't you find who killed him?

724
01:00:58,221 --> 01:00:59,153
Who should l ask?

725
01:00:59,355 --> 01:01:02,518
Siva Reddy is dead,
so you've to ask Baji Reddy.

726
01:01:03,059 --> 01:01:05,357
He's no kid to tell me
on asking him.

727
01:01:05,561 --> 01:01:08,052
You can't leave it,
put police pressure on him.

728
01:01:09,532 --> 01:01:11,659
Police are combing for me.

729
01:01:11,868 --> 01:01:15,702
Oh! Then it's good for you
to be underground.

730
01:01:15,905 --> 01:01:17,236
That's what l'm doing now.

731
01:01:17,440 --> 01:01:18,031
Yes indeed!

732
01:01:18,708 --> 01:01:21,802
You revealed your secrets to me.

733
01:01:22,011 --> 01:01:23,501
What if l tell it to everyone here?

734
01:01:23,846 --> 01:01:25,473
l didn't tell you on asking me,

735
01:01:25,815 --> 01:01:27,009
l told you because l trust you.

736
01:01:27,216 --> 01:01:28,080
Not that...

737
01:01:28,551 --> 01:01:29,711
l trust you because...

738
01:01:30,219 --> 01:01:32,847
...there's no one more trustworthy
like Hanuman to Rama.

739
01:01:38,227 --> 01:01:42,357
Siva Reddy's place of assassination...
Killer's place of operation.

740
01:01:43,599 --> 01:01:46,193
A man slated to become
next CM and one lakh crowd...

741
01:01:46,402 --> 01:01:48,495
20 TV news channels...
Z category security...

742
01:01:48,705 --> 01:01:50,866
20 inches gun and
two kilogram head.

743
01:01:51,074 --> 01:01:52,632
Pull the trigger and gone.
