1
00:01:31,691 --> 00:01:33,959
My name is Maurice.

2
00:01:33,961 --> 00:01:35,494
I'm French.

3
00:01:35,895 --> 00:01:39,198
I haven't been here
in New York for long.

4
00:01:39,200 --> 00:01:41,066
In Brooklyn.

5
00:01:41,068 --> 00:01:45,304
I left France, but if I
talk to you in English,

6
00:01:45,306 --> 00:01:48,006
it's because the
director asked me to.

7
00:01:48,975 --> 00:01:50,943
I don't really talk much.

8
00:01:52,078 --> 00:01:53,812
I won't talk much.

9
00:02:51,938 --> 00:02:54,239
My name is Maurice.

10
00:02:54,241 --> 00:02:56,475
I don't really exist.

11
00:02:56,477 --> 00:02:58,644
I'm just an image on the screen.

12
00:03:13,826 --> 00:03:15,027
People don't like that.

13
00:03:15,029 --> 00:03:16,628
They don't like it.

14
00:06:07,500 --> 00:06:08,867
Is it ok for you?

15
00:06:08,869 --> 00:06:10,969
Yeah, sure it's huge.

16
00:06:10,971 --> 00:06:13,972
Yeah, do you like the wall?

17
00:06:14,941 --> 00:06:16,975
It's interesting.

18
00:06:16,977 --> 00:06:18,410
I just put it in.

19
00:06:18,412 --> 00:06:20,679
I'm not quite sure about
it, but I think I like it.

20
00:06:22,181 --> 00:06:24,015
But make yourself at home.

21
00:06:24,017 --> 00:06:27,619
Come on, coat off,
hat off, relax.

22
00:06:28,388 --> 00:06:31,790
Lie on the bed, take a
nap, light your candles.

23
00:06:32,425 --> 00:06:34,359
If you need anything
I'll be in the kitchen.

24
00:06:34,361 --> 00:06:35,327
Ok.

25
00:06:35,329 --> 00:06:36,194
See you in a little bit.

26
00:06:36,196 --> 00:06:37,696
Thank you.

27
00:06:48,341 --> 00:06:51,710
So if I give you a room,
and maybe you can help

28
00:06:51,712 --> 00:06:56,214
do dishes, or help clean just
a little bit around the house,

29
00:06:56,216 --> 00:06:57,949
or even downstairs in the bar.

30
00:06:57,951 --> 00:06:59,885
Do you think you could do that?

31
00:07:00,353 --> 00:07:01,319
Yeah sure.

32
00:07:01,321 --> 00:07:02,721
Yeah?

33
00:07:03,756 --> 00:07:05,023
Hello darling.

34
00:07:05,025 --> 00:07:05,791
Hey.

35
00:07:05,793 --> 00:07:07,125
This is Maurice.

36
00:07:07,127 --> 00:07:08,427
New baby.

37
00:07:08,429 --> 00:07:09,461
Nice find.

38
00:07:09,463 --> 00:07:11,096
Thanks.

39
00:07:13,433 --> 00:07:15,667
All right babe, we
gotta talk about John.

40
00:07:15,669 --> 00:07:18,236
You know, I love him, I
know he's your friend,

41
00:07:18,238 --> 00:07:19,938
but he's pocketing money.

42
00:07:19,940 --> 00:07:21,840
I don't trust him.

43
00:07:21,842 --> 00:07:23,742
He's gotta go, ok?

44
00:07:24,377 --> 00:07:26,678
So I'm gonna have to do it.

45
00:07:36,823 --> 00:07:37,823
What's your name again?

46
00:07:37,825 --> 00:07:38,657
Maurice.

47
00:07:38,659 --> 00:07:39,858
Here.

48
00:07:39,860 --> 00:07:41,059
What is this?

49
00:07:41,061 --> 00:07:42,227
Candles.

50
00:07:42,229 --> 00:07:45,096
Come on, let's
deal with John, fuck.

51
00:07:45,098 --> 00:07:48,500
All right, all right,
come on, we gotta go.

52
00:07:48,502 --> 00:07:50,135
We gotta go talk to him.

53
00:07:55,074 --> 00:07:57,242
I'll show you
the bar and what to do.

54
00:07:57,844 --> 00:07:59,244
Ok.

55
00:07:59,246 --> 00:08:00,178
You can meet the
people who work there.

56
00:08:00,180 --> 00:08:02,147
They're nice, they'll like you.

57
00:08:41,220 --> 00:08:43,455
Go ahead and grab a mop
from the closet over there,

58
00:08:43,457 --> 00:08:47,125
and give the floor
a good once-over,

59
00:08:47,127 --> 00:08:49,828
and then after that you can
help me take down the rest

60
00:08:49,830 --> 00:08:53,899
of these chairs, and after that
you can probably go see Kim

61
00:08:53,901 --> 00:08:55,967
downstairs in the basement.

62
00:08:55,969 --> 00:08:58,937
She's probably gonna have a lot
of work for you tonight too.

63
00:08:58,939 --> 00:09:02,040
It's Tuesday so it's probably
not gonna be that busy,

64
00:09:02,042 --> 00:09:05,043
you know, I mean it's
gonna be pretty quiet,

65
00:09:05,045 --> 00:09:10,115
but the main thing is to just
make sure everything's tidy,

66
00:09:10,216 --> 00:09:13,285
clean, make sure everybody's
drinks are refilled,

67
00:09:13,287 --> 00:09:17,322
their waters, and make sure
you wipe down the tables.

68
00:09:17,324 --> 00:09:18,523
Right?

69
00:09:18,525 --> 00:09:19,991
That's important.

70
00:09:28,134 --> 00:09:30,235
Welcome to bushwick burlesque,

71
00:09:30,237 --> 00:09:33,138
scary bear's bawdy
birthday ball,

72
00:09:33,140 --> 00:09:34,506
is that what it said
on the Internet?

73
00:09:34,508 --> 00:09:35,507
I think
so, something like that.

74
00:09:35,509 --> 00:09:36,841
Exuberance both.

75
00:09:36,843 --> 00:09:39,210
Exuberance both.

76
00:09:39,212 --> 00:09:43,448
We are celebrating the
birthday of our own peddler

77
00:09:43,450 --> 00:09:44,649
of exuberant both...

78
00:09:44,651 --> 00:09:45,550
that's me.

79
00:09:45,552 --> 00:09:46,818
Mr scary bear.

80
00:09:46,820 --> 00:09:50,388
Thanks friends,
family, whores, sluts,

81
00:09:51,324 --> 00:09:54,192
general acquaintances,
and people off the street.

82
00:09:54,194 --> 00:09:56,094
Thank you so much for coming.

83
00:10:23,222 --> 00:10:25,991
Baby, you gonna
come say, "goodnight?"

84
00:10:37,103 --> 00:10:38,336
- Betty.
- - Hi.

85
00:10:39,605 --> 00:10:41,306
Goodnight.

86
00:10:43,175 --> 00:10:44,109
Night.

87
00:10:44,111 --> 00:10:46,011
How's your room?

88
00:10:46,013 --> 00:10:46,878
It'll do fine.

89
00:10:46,880 --> 00:10:47,646
- Good?
- Yeah.

90
00:10:47,648 --> 00:10:48,747
All right.

91
00:10:48,749 --> 00:10:49,748
Sleep well.

92
00:10:49,750 --> 00:10:50,749
See you.

93
00:10:50,751 --> 00:10:51,850
Bye.

94
00:10:53,986 --> 00:10:56,154
They're stuck.

95
00:10:56,156 --> 00:10:57,055
The eggs?

96
00:10:57,057 --> 00:10:58,356
Mmhmm.

97
00:10:58,358 --> 00:10:59,958
They're stuck in the pack.

98
00:10:59,960 --> 00:11:01,526
Look.

99
00:11:04,630 --> 00:11:05,897
It's true.

100
00:11:05,899 --> 00:11:07,499
You could
just pour it in there.

101
00:11:11,604 --> 00:11:12,771
Do you need me to do anything?

102
00:11:12,773 --> 00:11:14,072
I feel bad just sitting.

103
00:11:14,074 --> 00:11:15,607
No, it's fine.

104
00:11:18,177 --> 00:11:20,045
You're so good to us.

105
00:11:20,047 --> 00:11:21,680
Hello!

106
00:11:21,682 --> 00:11:23,214
How are you?

107
00:11:23,216 --> 00:11:26,785
Good good good, I brought
croissants for the French boy.

108
00:11:26,787 --> 00:11:28,520
Wow, special treatment.

109
00:11:28,522 --> 00:11:30,221
So help yourself.

110
00:11:30,223 --> 00:11:31,489
Hi babe how are you?

111
00:11:31,491 --> 00:11:32,791
Oh good, how are you?

112
00:11:32,793 --> 00:11:34,092
What are you making?

113
00:11:35,428 --> 00:11:36,861
- Good to see you.
- You too.

114
00:11:36,863 --> 00:11:38,430
So I got a couple of chocolate,

115
00:11:38,432 --> 00:11:41,433
and a couple of I think almond.

116
00:11:41,435 --> 00:11:44,335
Ooh, for you.

117
00:11:44,570 --> 00:11:46,237
Do you have a mug?

118
00:11:46,972 --> 00:11:48,339
Mmm, do you want?

119
00:11:48,341 --> 00:11:50,341
How was it last night?

120
00:11:50,343 --> 00:11:51,443
I didn't work last night,

121
00:11:51,445 --> 00:11:52,644
but I heard it's pretty shitty.

122
00:11:52,646 --> 00:11:54,512
Who played last night?

123
00:11:55,614 --> 00:11:57,348
It was a dj, I think it
was David or something,

124
00:11:57,350 --> 00:11:58,616
I don't remember.

125
00:11:58,618 --> 00:11:59,884
New?

126
00:11:59,886 --> 00:12:02,087
No an old one we used but...

127
00:12:02,089 --> 00:12:03,354
we haven't used him
in a while though.

128
00:12:03,356 --> 00:12:04,856
We should start using him more.

129
00:12:04,858 --> 00:12:06,157
Why did we stop?

130
00:12:06,159 --> 00:12:09,227
It just gets expensive
after a while, you know?

131
00:12:09,229 --> 00:12:11,830
If they're not gonna
bring people, it's like,

132
00:12:11,832 --> 00:12:13,932
why spend that much
money, you know?

133
00:12:13,934 --> 00:12:15,533
And you, how was your night?

134
00:12:15,535 --> 00:12:17,035
It was good, good, yeah.

135
00:12:17,037 --> 00:12:18,269
How are your eggs?

136
00:12:18,271 --> 00:12:20,572
Oh, um, they're good, yeah.

137
00:12:20,574 --> 00:12:21,406
They're good?

138
00:12:21,408 --> 00:12:22,107
They're what?

139
00:12:22,109 --> 00:12:23,408
Good or cold?

140
00:12:24,744 --> 00:12:26,177
Yeah tell us
more about yourself.

141
00:12:26,179 --> 00:12:27,345
Yeah when's your birthday?

142
00:12:27,347 --> 00:12:28,279
We need to know everything.

143
00:12:28,281 --> 00:12:29,481
Yeah, are you a virgin?

144
00:12:29,483 --> 00:12:30,782
Did you run away?

145
00:12:30,784 --> 00:12:32,584
Like your parents?

146
00:12:34,754 --> 00:12:36,154
I don't know.

147
00:12:36,156 --> 00:12:37,422
Who do you like
more, your mom or your dad?

148
00:12:37,424 --> 00:12:39,524
- Mom.
- - Mom?

149
00:12:39,526 --> 00:12:40,892
Makes sense.

150
00:12:41,060 --> 00:12:42,594
You look
really pretty like this.

151
00:12:42,596 --> 00:12:44,262
And I'm not usually?

152
00:12:46,031 --> 00:12:47,732
You're an asshole.

153
00:13:29,175 --> 00:13:31,376
This job's kind of stupid.

154
00:13:32,578 --> 00:13:35,613
But we make a lot
of fucking money.

155
00:15:07,406 --> 00:15:08,806
So how was your first day?

156
00:15:08,808 --> 00:15:09,741
Hmm?

157
00:15:09,743 --> 00:15:11,442
How was your first day?

158
00:15:11,944 --> 00:15:16,047
Washing dishes, what about you?

159
00:15:17,149 --> 00:15:18,716
It's good, I'm tired.

160
00:15:18,718 --> 00:15:20,285
Oh I see.

161
00:15:22,121 --> 00:15:23,922
You see the show at all?

162
00:15:23,924 --> 00:15:25,890
Yeah, yeah I did.

163
00:15:25,892 --> 00:15:28,960
It was cool, well it's
strange, but cool.

164
00:15:28,962 --> 00:15:30,461
Yeah?

165
00:15:32,097 --> 00:15:33,798
Did you do all these?

166
00:15:35,901 --> 00:15:37,669
Yeah I did.

167
00:15:38,570 --> 00:15:40,438
Ok, well I'll see you tomorrow.

168
00:15:40,440 --> 00:15:41,773
See you.

169
00:15:41,775 --> 00:15:43,975
You did very
well today at the bar.

170
00:15:43,977 --> 00:15:44,943
Well thank you.

171
00:15:44,945 --> 00:15:46,511
No thank you.

172
00:15:46,513 --> 00:15:47,445
You see him?

173
00:15:47,447 --> 00:15:48,613
Yeah he did all right.

174
00:15:48,615 --> 00:15:49,747
She gives you no love.

175
00:15:49,749 --> 00:15:51,249
You did very well.

176
00:15:51,251 --> 00:15:52,250
Thanks.

177
00:15:52,252 --> 00:15:53,451
- Yes?
- Yes.

178
00:15:53,453 --> 00:15:54,719
Would you
keep us company tonight?

179
00:15:54,721 --> 00:15:56,554
- Oh, yeah.
- - Yeah?

180
00:15:56,556 --> 00:15:58,623
- Yeah.
- I think that's a good idea.

181
00:15:58,625 --> 00:16:00,224
You have to take your
underwear off though.

182
00:16:00,226 --> 00:16:01,993
Really?

183
00:16:01,995 --> 00:16:03,895
- It's the rule.
- Ok.

184
00:16:03,897 --> 00:16:04,862
Those are the rules.

185
00:16:04,864 --> 00:16:06,564
Ok.

186
00:16:07,066 --> 00:16:08,633
So shy all the time, why?

187
00:16:08,635 --> 00:16:10,034
I know, so nervous.

188
00:16:10,036 --> 00:16:11,769
Is it something
to do with that?

189
00:16:11,771 --> 00:16:13,604
Yes it totally is that.

190
00:16:13,606 --> 00:16:16,240
Wow, I'm impressed baby.

191
00:16:16,242 --> 00:16:18,476
I choose wow, come on Kim.

192
00:16:18,478 --> 00:16:19,844
You should behave.

193
00:16:19,846 --> 00:16:21,326
You should
know me better than that.

194
00:16:21,613 --> 00:16:23,815
You have to behave, we're
not having sex with you.

195
00:16:23,817 --> 00:16:25,483
- All right.
- So you know.

196
00:16:27,019 --> 00:16:30,755
Again, she's rough,
more mature, but come on.

197
00:16:37,563 --> 00:16:39,864
- Good night baby.
- Night.

198
00:17:18,737 --> 00:17:20,805
You know this is the
only bathroom here right?

199
00:17:20,807 --> 00:17:22,774
Ah yeah, sorry.

200
00:17:26,578 --> 00:17:28,079
That's the problem
with you teenagers,

201
00:17:28,081 --> 00:17:31,115
you're either dirty or you
take showers for an hour.

202
00:20:55,420 --> 00:20:56,887
Is it filming?

203
00:20:56,889 --> 00:20:59,590
Yeah it's filming man,
of course it's filming.

204
00:20:59,592 --> 00:21:01,158
Look at my baby.

205
00:21:01,160 --> 00:21:03,261
Look at the baby.

206
00:21:03,263 --> 00:21:07,131
Baby needs to get clean,
takes an hour long shower.

207
00:21:09,601 --> 00:21:12,303
Baby's gotta get clean.

208
00:21:13,338 --> 00:21:15,273
Good job mommy.

209
00:21:15,275 --> 00:21:16,641
Of course.

210
00:21:18,043 --> 00:21:20,111
Drop the soap.

211
00:21:20,113 --> 00:21:23,080
Just for fun purposes.

212
00:21:25,317 --> 00:21:28,486
Oh fuck girl, it's
all getting wet no?

213
00:21:28,920 --> 00:21:30,855
No this thing
can go under the water.

214
00:21:30,857 --> 00:21:33,090
No fuck you,
you're gonna break my phone.

215
00:21:33,092 --> 00:21:35,126
No it can go under the water.

216
00:21:35,128 --> 00:21:37,461
Fuck you, it's
going black, it's gonna...

217
00:21:40,666 --> 00:21:42,099
oh fuck!

218
00:21:42,101 --> 00:21:43,968
You fucking broke my phone.

219
00:21:43,970 --> 00:21:45,770
Oh, you can get a new one.

220
00:21:45,772 --> 00:21:47,905
You broke it, what the hell?

221
00:21:47,907 --> 00:21:49,073
You know what, it's the case.

222
00:21:49,075 --> 00:21:50,441
No, that is not ok!

223
00:21:50,443 --> 00:21:54,378
Ok, that's the
reception is over here.

224
00:21:54,913 --> 00:21:59,884
Ok, this is the clothes for
sale for people came to the gym.

225
00:22:01,553 --> 00:22:04,989
This is the punching
bag over here,

226
00:22:04,991 --> 00:22:08,426
and those weights you
can have here every day,

227
00:22:08,428 --> 00:22:10,661
and lift weight for the gym.

228
00:22:20,339 --> 00:22:22,139
- One, two, three.
- Ok.

229
00:22:22,141 --> 00:22:24,342
One, two, three, yes?

230
00:22:25,911 --> 00:22:27,211
One, two, three.

231
00:22:27,213 --> 00:22:28,579
One, two, three.

232
00:22:28,581 --> 00:22:30,481
One, two, three.

233
00:22:30,483 --> 00:22:31,982
Uppercut, yes.

234
00:22:31,984 --> 00:22:34,285
One, two, three, yes very good.

235
00:22:34,287 --> 00:22:37,355
Very good, very good, yes.

236
00:22:37,357 --> 00:22:39,623
Ok, one, two, yes.

237
00:22:42,027 --> 00:22:44,328
And left, right.

238
00:22:44,596 --> 00:22:46,597
- Don't use too much power.
- - Ok.

239
00:22:46,599 --> 00:22:48,065
Don't use too much power.

240
00:22:48,067 --> 00:22:50,134
Yes, left, right, uppercut, yes.

241
00:22:50,136 --> 00:22:53,571
Left, right, uppercut.

242
00:24:54,025 --> 00:24:56,660
- Is that a bed?
- - Yep.

243
00:24:58,563 --> 00:25:01,866
Oh man, why you
wanna sleep here?

244
00:25:02,501 --> 00:25:03,834
I don't want to sleep here,

245
00:25:03,836 --> 00:25:06,670
but I left my keys
at my apartment,

246
00:25:06,672 --> 00:25:07,972
and my roommate's mad at me,

247
00:25:07,974 --> 00:25:09,840
so this is kinda
the only choice.

248
00:25:09,842 --> 00:25:11,075
So bad.

249
00:25:11,077 --> 00:25:13,611
It's not so bad,
I've done it before.

250
00:25:14,546 --> 00:25:16,580
Actually pretty comfortable.

251
00:25:16,582 --> 00:25:18,015
- You sure about that?
- Yeah.

252
00:25:18,017 --> 00:25:20,017
- This?
- Yeah.

253
00:25:20,019 --> 00:25:22,553
Oh man, I would
not sleep on this.

254
00:25:23,788 --> 00:25:25,823
Well I don't
really have a choice.

255
00:25:27,893 --> 00:25:31,762
Maybe if you want, you
could spend a night upstairs.

256
00:25:32,631 --> 00:25:33,864
Where?

257
00:25:33,866 --> 00:25:35,833
My room.

258
00:25:37,636 --> 00:25:38,969
In your room?

259
00:25:38,971 --> 00:25:40,871
Only for a night.

260
00:25:41,506 --> 00:25:42,473
Ok.

261
00:25:55,487 --> 00:25:58,622
Your ceiling's falling down.

262
00:25:58,624 --> 00:26:00,624
Yep.

263
00:26:00,626 --> 00:26:02,726
Doesn't matter.

264
00:26:05,630 --> 00:26:06,830
Night.

265
00:26:08,733 --> 00:26:10,134
Goodnight.

266
00:26:20,545 --> 00:26:22,413
No, I understand
what you're saying,

267
00:26:22,415 --> 00:26:24,348
I understand why
you're doing it,

268
00:26:24,350 --> 00:26:27,651
I'm just really would
appreciate a week.

269
00:26:27,653 --> 00:26:29,853
Just give me a week, two weeks?

270
00:26:29,855 --> 00:26:31,555
Two weeks, you'll
give me two weeks?

271
00:26:31,557 --> 00:26:33,824
We have things
coming up I promise.

272
00:26:34,359 --> 00:26:37,628
No I'm, come on, you know me.

273
00:26:37,630 --> 00:26:39,964
You know me, yeah?

274
00:26:40,565 --> 00:26:42,132
Can you?

275
00:26:44,703 --> 00:26:47,705
Ok, yes, no I hear
you, I hear you.

276
00:26:48,740 --> 00:26:50,975
So a week, you'll
give me one week?

277
00:26:51,643 --> 00:26:53,544
Ok? Ok.

278
00:26:53,546 --> 00:26:55,245
Thank you, I appreciate it.

279
00:26:55,247 --> 00:26:56,547
Bye.

280
00:27:00,151 --> 00:27:01,552
Fuck.

281
00:27:10,462 --> 00:27:11,695
Good morning.

282
00:27:11,697 --> 00:27:13,464
- Morning.
- Morning.

283
00:27:13,466 --> 00:27:15,366
You two sleeping together now,

284
00:27:15,368 --> 00:27:16,533
and burning my toast?

285
00:27:16,535 --> 00:27:18,902
Yeah I burnt your toast, sorry.

286
00:27:18,904 --> 00:27:21,038
Strictly platonic
I can assure you.

287
00:27:21,040 --> 00:27:23,874
Sleeping
together, burning my toast.

288
00:27:23,876 --> 00:27:25,509
I'm sorry.

289
00:27:25,511 --> 00:27:26,510
He's burnt
like four pieces now.

290
00:27:26,512 --> 00:27:28,078
No, only two.

291
00:27:28,080 --> 00:27:29,313
You ate the other two.

292
00:27:29,315 --> 00:27:31,181
No I didn't.

293
00:27:33,785 --> 00:27:36,987
I'm fucking
tired, didn't sleep at all.

294
00:27:36,989 --> 00:27:38,722
Wine for breakfast?

295
00:27:39,991 --> 00:27:41,992
It's better than burnt toast.

296
00:27:54,072 --> 00:27:55,239
I'm Luka.

297
00:27:55,241 --> 00:27:57,274
Of course, nice to meet you.

298
00:27:57,276 --> 00:27:59,009
Nice to meet you.

299
00:28:45,757 --> 00:28:49,393
Doesn't it bother
you watching us working

300
00:28:49,395 --> 00:28:51,895
while doing nothing?

301
00:28:51,897 --> 00:28:55,199
- You call that working?
- Fuck you!

302
00:29:20,959 --> 00:29:23,727
This is my bed, you
wanna sleep downstairs?

303
00:29:23,729 --> 00:29:25,529
No, no, no.

304
00:29:33,104 --> 00:29:36,340
French boy, full of mystery huh?

305
00:29:40,712 --> 00:29:42,312
That's fine.

306
00:29:48,686 --> 00:29:51,755
I don't know, I just feel,

307
00:29:54,559 --> 00:29:56,727
I feel like I could
tell you anything right?

308
00:30:05,804 --> 00:30:10,874
I haven't really been able
to trust people very often

309
00:30:12,944 --> 00:30:16,613
but you're easy to
talk to you know?

310
00:30:20,418 --> 00:30:22,452
I feel like you're listening.

311
00:30:24,355 --> 00:30:25,989
You're listening.

312
00:30:27,826 --> 00:30:29,760
I feel like you care.

313
00:30:34,299 --> 00:30:37,334
We're not so different you know?

314
00:30:56,788 --> 00:31:02,860
Um, when I first saw
you, I thought you were

315
00:31:03,928 --> 00:31:08,999
just some asshole
kid but I don't know,

316
00:31:12,136 --> 00:31:14,371
there's just
something about you.

317
00:31:36,761 --> 00:31:38,962
I think I love you.

318
00:32:36,087 --> 00:32:37,654
You're a good guy.

319
00:36:00,558 --> 00:36:02,959
You wanna make
sure the audience can see it.

320
00:36:02,961 --> 00:36:06,429
Ok and I want you to
give me your best shot,

321
00:36:06,431 --> 00:36:08,965
into here ok?

322
00:36:09,133 --> 00:36:11,401
What are you gonna
do a straight punch?

323
00:36:11,602 --> 00:36:13,136
- Yep.
- Awesome.

324
00:36:13,138 --> 00:36:14,471
Here we go, thank you Johnny.

325
00:36:14,473 --> 00:36:15,605
Here we go.

326
00:36:15,607 --> 00:36:17,407
Ready, you're gonna
give me the eye.

327
00:36:17,409 --> 00:36:19,376
I'm ready, ok.

328
00:36:23,681 --> 00:36:25,849
Take a step back.

329
00:36:26,918 --> 00:36:28,885
Right, one more, and
really really pound

330
00:36:28,887 --> 00:36:31,454
that shit into my fuckin' gut.

331
00:36:31,756 --> 00:36:33,256
Hit me!

332
00:36:41,966 --> 00:36:45,502
Oh fuck, gawd, I hate you
so much fucking racism.

333
00:36:55,012 --> 00:36:57,881
Homophobia.

334
00:37:04,155 --> 00:37:05,422
Hold it down.

335
00:37:05,424 --> 00:37:09,392
I'm gonna beat
homophobia into the past.

336
00:37:09,894 --> 00:37:12,362
Argh, I hate you homophobia!

337
00:39:51,055 --> 00:39:53,089
Come on, it's the beach.

338
00:39:57,395 --> 00:39:59,329
Oh, get off, I'm wet!

339
00:39:59,331 --> 00:40:01,097
Stop, stop.

340
00:40:06,670 --> 00:40:08,371
So where's France?

341
00:40:09,607 --> 00:40:10,507
Is it there?

342
00:40:10,509 --> 00:40:11,875
Man, I don't know.

343
00:40:11,877 --> 00:40:13,309
Is it over there?

344
00:40:13,311 --> 00:40:14,811
Is it over there?

345
00:40:14,813 --> 00:40:16,379
No.

346
00:40:16,981 --> 00:40:18,515
I don't know where it is.

347
00:40:18,517 --> 00:40:20,183
It's straight through.

348
00:40:20,185 --> 00:40:22,118
I don't care.

349
00:40:23,721 --> 00:40:26,523
- Do you miss it?
- No.

350
00:40:49,847 --> 00:40:54,584
Well I'll move my
knight from here to here.

351
00:40:55,820 --> 00:40:57,420
- Ok.
- Your turn.

352
00:40:57,422 --> 00:41:00,056
I'll move my pawn here.

353
00:41:01,826 --> 00:41:06,896
Mmm, and my knight here.

354
00:41:10,067 --> 00:41:12,101
I'll move my pawn here.

355
00:41:12,603 --> 00:41:14,070
My knight here.

356
00:41:14,405 --> 00:41:15,872
I ate your pawn.

357
00:41:16,307 --> 00:41:19,008
- You ate it?
- Yep.

358
00:41:19,010 --> 00:41:21,544
- You ate my pawn?
- Yep.

359
00:41:21,546 --> 00:41:23,680
- You captured my pawn.
- No I ate it.

360
00:41:23,682 --> 00:41:25,882
You didn't eat it.

361
00:41:25,884 --> 00:41:30,820
Ok, all right, well I'll
move my knight here.

362
00:41:32,423 --> 00:41:37,393
Hmm, I move my bishop...

363
00:41:40,631 --> 00:41:42,198
Freddy.

364
00:41:42,200 --> 00:41:43,833
- How are you?
- How are you?

365
00:41:43,835 --> 00:41:45,935
I'm good, I'm good,
what are you doing here?

366
00:41:45,937 --> 00:41:47,637
- I live here.
- - You live here?

367
00:41:47,639 --> 00:41:48,771
Yeah, like down the block.

368
00:41:48,773 --> 00:41:51,074
Oh my god, um this is Maurice.

369
00:41:51,076 --> 00:41:53,510
Hi, how are you, I'm Freddy.

370
00:41:53,512 --> 00:41:55,011
Yeah what are
you up to tonight?

371
00:41:55,013 --> 00:41:56,413
Nothing, what are
you doing tonight?

372
00:41:56,414 --> 00:41:58,681
Well, you know, sittin'.

373
00:41:58,683 --> 00:42:00,884
- So nothing?
- Yep.

374
00:42:00,886 --> 00:42:02,919
We're playing chess.

375
00:42:02,921 --> 00:42:04,721
- Who's winning?
- - I am.

376
00:42:08,292 --> 00:42:09,526
It's your turn,

377
00:42:09,528 --> 00:42:13,863
I'll take my unicorn
from here to maybe here.

378
00:42:14,398 --> 00:42:15,932
That's cool, sounds good.

379
00:42:15,934 --> 00:42:17,333
- I think that wins.
- - Yeah.

380
00:42:17,335 --> 00:42:18,668
I think unicorns win.

381
00:42:18,670 --> 00:42:20,069
There's no
fighting with a unicorn.

382
00:42:20,071 --> 00:42:21,971
- No.
- - Checkmate.

383
00:42:21,973 --> 00:42:24,274
Good game, good job.

384
00:42:24,276 --> 00:42:26,109
Thank you, thank you.

385
00:42:52,736 --> 00:42:54,003
Come on ladies.

386
00:42:54,005 --> 00:42:55,838
- Excusé moi.
- Excuse me.

387
00:42:55,840 --> 00:42:58,474
Ladies? Thank you.

388
00:46:03,627 --> 00:46:05,628
Hey Luka you can go babe.

389
00:46:05,630 --> 00:46:06,596
Are you sure?

390
00:46:06,598 --> 00:46:08,431
Mmhmm, we got it.

391
00:46:08,433 --> 00:46:10,233
Ok.

392
00:46:12,503 --> 00:46:14,270
Betty what the
fuck are you doing?

393
00:46:14,272 --> 00:46:16,405
Having a drink.

394
00:46:16,407 --> 00:46:18,040
You're not supposed
to drink when you work,

395
00:46:18,042 --> 00:46:18,975
you know that.

396
00:46:18,977 --> 00:46:21,144
No one's here right now.

397
00:46:22,679 --> 00:46:24,547
No one's here right now.

398
00:46:24,549 --> 00:46:26,983
You've been drinking
all fucking night.

399
00:46:26,985 --> 00:46:28,684
People were
there and they wanted

400
00:46:28,686 --> 00:46:30,219
me to drink with them.

401
00:46:30,221 --> 00:46:32,355
This isn't a fucking party,
this is a business to be run.

402
00:46:32,357 --> 00:46:33,523
Do you understand that?

403
00:46:33,525 --> 00:46:35,024
Yes.

404
00:46:35,026 --> 00:46:36,058
Yes, you
understand that that's why

405
00:46:36,060 --> 00:46:37,460
you're fucked up right now?

406
00:46:37,462 --> 00:46:39,228
How much did we make tonight?

407
00:46:39,230 --> 00:46:40,596
Let me see.

408
00:46:42,232 --> 00:46:44,367
Are you fucking kidding me?

409
00:46:44,369 --> 00:46:46,502
This is how much we have?

410
00:46:46,504 --> 00:46:47,970
I'm sorry.

411
00:46:47,972 --> 00:46:49,472
You're sorry.

412
00:46:49,474 --> 00:46:52,475
You know earlier tonight we
had 200 more dollars in there?

413
00:46:52,477 --> 00:46:54,610
- You know that?
- No.

414
00:46:54,612 --> 00:46:55,711
You know we're losing this bar

415
00:46:55,713 --> 00:46:57,713
every fucking
dollar it's making?

416
00:46:57,715 --> 00:46:59,982
I don't care about the
bar, I'm worried about you.

417
00:46:59,984 --> 00:47:01,450
No get away from me.

418
00:47:01,452 --> 00:47:02,618
Get away from me.

419
00:47:02,620 --> 00:47:04,387
Everything's not ok right now.

420
00:47:04,389 --> 00:47:06,556
You need to go
upstairs and go to bed.

421
00:47:07,090 --> 00:47:08,391
Now.

422
00:47:08,992 --> 00:47:10,693
Now!

423
00:47:11,495 --> 00:47:14,230
Fine, I'm going, I'm going.

424
00:47:14,232 --> 00:47:15,698
Will you come with me?

425
00:47:15,700 --> 00:47:18,968
Just fucking go, I'm
not fucking coming with you.

426
00:47:20,103 --> 00:47:23,306
- Go!
- I'm going, I'm going.

427
00:47:55,038 --> 00:47:57,707
Come on, give me one.

428
00:47:57,709 --> 00:47:59,475
Give me one right on
the chin, come on.

429
00:47:59,477 --> 00:48:01,477
Come on, come on.

430
00:48:01,479 --> 00:48:02,645
Talking dirty.

431
00:48:02,647 --> 00:48:04,680
Come on you bitch,
come on, come on.

432
00:48:04,682 --> 00:48:06,716
Come on, come on bitch.

433
00:48:21,465 --> 00:48:22,932
Come in harder.

434
00:48:22,934 --> 00:48:24,500
You going light on me?

435
00:48:24,502 --> 00:48:25,768
You sleeping on me?

436
00:48:25,770 --> 00:48:27,503
Come on you guys.

437
00:48:30,073 --> 00:48:31,507
You're fucking taller than me.

438
00:48:31,509 --> 00:48:34,277
All right, if anything bad
happens have you got him?

439
00:48:34,279 --> 00:48:36,078
Yeah.

440
00:49:09,246 --> 00:49:11,414
I can give you a free
lesson if you want.

441
00:49:11,416 --> 00:49:13,616
- Really?
- Yeah.

442
00:49:13,618 --> 00:49:16,953
- Ok.
- Come by next week.

443
00:49:16,955 --> 00:49:18,788
I've trained a couple of people.

444
00:49:18,790 --> 00:49:20,523
- Ok.
- Just my friends though.

445
00:49:20,525 --> 00:49:21,791
Just friends?

446
00:49:21,793 --> 00:49:23,426
So it's special,
you should feel special.

447
00:49:23,428 --> 00:49:25,861
Oh ok, I do feel special.

448
00:49:26,563 --> 00:49:29,298
Why don't you come
boxing pretty boy?

449
00:49:29,300 --> 00:49:31,934
I'd be eaten alive.

450
00:49:32,602 --> 00:49:35,671
They don't like my
kind over there.

451
00:49:35,673 --> 00:49:37,406
They'll get used to you.

452
00:49:38,775 --> 00:49:39,775
He's laughing at you.

453
00:49:39,777 --> 00:49:42,178
Yeah he is, fuck you.

454
00:49:42,813 --> 00:49:45,147
I think you need a
couple more lessons.

455
00:50:28,625 --> 00:50:31,460
- So you work here?
- I do.

456
00:50:31,462 --> 00:50:33,496
Why are you here
on your day off?

457
00:50:33,498 --> 00:50:35,965
I live upstairs too.

458
00:50:35,967 --> 00:50:38,067
- Makes sense.
- Yeah.

459
00:50:39,202 --> 00:50:41,404
- Cool.
- I like it.

460
00:50:41,406 --> 00:50:43,839
They're really
nice, Kim and Betty.

461
00:50:45,609 --> 00:50:48,244
They own the bar.

462
00:50:48,246 --> 00:50:50,880
I don't know them,
I just know Maurice.

463
00:50:50,882 --> 00:50:52,882
Oh.

464
00:50:52,884 --> 00:50:55,217
Got it from boxing,
we share towels.

465
00:50:55,219 --> 00:50:57,586
Oh do you?

466
00:50:58,422 --> 00:50:59,922
I bet.

467
00:50:59,924 --> 00:51:02,124
Are you even gay?

468
00:51:02,859 --> 00:51:07,530
No, not at all.

469
00:51:15,772 --> 00:51:17,073
Ok.

470
00:51:20,143 --> 00:51:23,179
I like girls, and
you look like a girl.

471
00:51:23,713 --> 00:51:25,281
Thank you.

472
00:51:27,184 --> 00:51:29,785
So you'll just do anything
that looks like a girl?

473
00:51:30,954 --> 00:51:33,956
I'll do anything that moves.

474
00:51:33,958 --> 00:51:35,958
I move.

475
00:52:25,675 --> 00:52:27,109
Luka.

476
00:52:42,993 --> 00:52:44,360
All right.

477
00:52:46,630 --> 00:52:48,864
This is my bedroom.

478
00:52:49,766 --> 00:52:51,433
This is my bed.

479
00:52:53,837 --> 00:52:55,804
Is that what you want?

480
00:53:16,626 --> 00:53:18,527
What the fuck
is wrong with you?

481
00:53:20,564 --> 00:53:21,830
Huh?

482
00:53:22,832 --> 00:53:24,900
Fine, don't say anything.

483
00:53:24,902 --> 00:53:27,002
This is what you wanted right?

484
00:53:28,572 --> 00:53:30,039
Huh?

485
00:53:31,107 --> 00:53:34,009
So I slept with
Charlie, big deal.

486
00:53:34,377 --> 00:53:36,912
Can you leave?

487
00:53:36,914 --> 00:53:38,881
Shut the fuck up.

488
00:53:41,685 --> 00:53:44,153
It was your idea
to begin with you know.

489
00:53:44,354 --> 00:53:46,589
You said you just
wanna be friends.

490
00:53:47,724 --> 00:53:50,259
Can you please leave?

491
00:53:59,536 --> 00:54:00,936
Happy?

492
00:54:03,006 --> 00:54:05,374
Can you tell me what you want?

493
00:54:05,775 --> 00:54:07,776
Anything, say anything!

494
00:54:14,284 --> 00:54:19,321
You know, I really
thought, never mind.

495
00:54:22,759 --> 00:54:24,360
Whatever.

496
00:54:40,076 --> 00:54:42,111
- Who are you?
- Charlie

497
00:54:43,580 --> 00:54:45,981
- oh Maurice's friend, sorry.
- - Ok.

498
00:54:46,549 --> 00:54:47,216
Who are you?

499
00:54:47,218 --> 00:54:49,018
Kim, the owner.

500
00:54:49,020 --> 00:54:50,986
Kim the owner.

501
00:54:50,988 --> 00:54:52,755
You don't have any jobs do you?

502
00:54:52,757 --> 00:54:54,990
No not right now.

503
00:54:54,992 --> 00:54:56,592
All right.

504
00:54:58,561 --> 00:54:59,795
You know, you can
leave your number

505
00:54:59,797 --> 00:55:01,430
at the bar though if you want.

506
00:55:01,432 --> 00:55:03,899
- Ok.
- What's your name again?

507
00:55:03,901 --> 00:55:07,002
- Charlie.
- Charlie, ok.

508
00:55:07,004 --> 00:55:09,138
- Thanks Kim.
- Yeah.

509
00:57:13,730 --> 00:57:15,431
What is this?

510
00:57:16,166 --> 00:57:17,900
It's a tattoo.

511
00:57:18,868 --> 00:57:22,304
I see, but, "j'ai douleur."

512
00:57:23,473 --> 00:57:26,241
This is not French.

513
00:57:26,243 --> 00:57:27,342
What do you mean?

514
00:57:27,344 --> 00:57:30,512
I mean, this is wrong.

515
00:57:30,514 --> 00:57:33,982
In French you will never
say, "j'ai douleur."

516
00:57:35,285 --> 00:57:37,486
You will say, don't know,

517
00:57:38,855 --> 00:57:41,457
j'ai mal, je souffre,

518
00:57:41,459 --> 00:57:44,226
but never, "j'ai douleur."

519
00:57:46,830 --> 00:57:50,132
- Great.
- - Why?

520
00:57:52,068 --> 00:57:53,368
Why what?

521
00:57:53,370 --> 00:57:55,604
Why, "j'ai douleur?"

522
00:57:56,940 --> 00:58:00,008
- Why did I get it?
- Yeah, what happened?

523
00:58:08,451 --> 00:58:10,953
Back when I lived in Florida,

524
00:58:10,955 --> 00:58:14,790
I dated this guy
for about four years

525
00:58:16,659 --> 00:58:19,828
and then I found out
that he had been sleeping

526
00:58:19,830 --> 00:58:23,432
with my best friend
for about two years,

527
00:58:24,801 --> 00:58:29,771
so I got the tattoo and
packed up all my things,

528
00:58:30,540 --> 00:58:33,442
and I just moved to New York.

529
00:58:40,149 --> 00:58:41,783
Stupid right?

530
00:58:42,352 --> 00:58:46,355
No, it's full of sense.

531
00:58:48,925 --> 00:58:50,993
Full of mystery.

532
00:58:59,068 --> 00:59:00,903
It's ok right now.

533
00:59:01,905 --> 00:59:03,372
Je ne pas douleur.

534
00:59:05,975 --> 00:59:07,809
Je ne pas douleur.

535
00:59:10,680 --> 00:59:12,748
Everybody's got, "douleur."

536
00:59:12,750 --> 00:59:15,183
- Douleur.
- Douleur.

537
00:59:20,023 --> 00:59:21,857
Yeah you're right.

538
00:59:47,483 --> 00:59:50,018
You're a big freakin'
kid you know that?

539
00:59:50,787 --> 00:59:52,654
Just a big child.

540
00:59:55,592 --> 00:59:57,326
It's all right.

541
01:00:02,198 --> 01:00:04,633
Give me your hand.

542
01:00:05,401 --> 01:00:07,202
The other one.

543
01:00:09,205 --> 01:00:11,573
Put it down on the stage.

544
01:00:15,645 --> 01:00:17,479
Like this.

545
01:00:31,561 --> 01:00:34,396
Do you carry that knife
around with you everywhere?

546
01:00:46,909 --> 01:00:48,810
Do you trust me?

547
01:00:50,346 --> 01:00:52,314
I hardly know you.

548
01:01:27,216 --> 01:01:29,151
Turn yourself.

549
01:01:43,032 --> 01:01:45,667
Starting now, you
can't look at my face

550
01:01:45,669 --> 01:01:48,036
during the night anymore.

551
01:02:25,141 --> 01:02:27,542
Community chest, all right.

552
01:02:27,910 --> 01:02:29,311
Go to jail.

553
01:02:29,313 --> 01:02:31,480
That's great.

554
01:02:31,681 --> 01:02:33,615
I'll sell it to you for 500.

555
01:02:33,617 --> 01:02:36,885
No, I'm not buying your,
"get out of jail free card."

556
01:02:36,887 --> 01:02:38,453
I'm gonna get out my own way.

557
01:02:38,455 --> 01:02:40,222
Oh, sexy like this.

558
01:02:40,490 --> 01:02:42,257
Ah, move please, we're
playing "monopoly,"

559
01:02:42,259 --> 01:02:43,959
this is serious.

560
01:02:44,193 --> 01:02:46,495
How do you live
with yourself Charlie?

561
01:02:48,297 --> 01:02:51,700
Oh, you're disgusting,
fuck you, move!

562
01:02:52,168 --> 01:02:53,969
Don't touch me.

563
01:02:55,671 --> 01:02:57,372
Move!

564
01:02:57,573 --> 01:02:59,474
Charlie, we're trying to play.

565
01:02:59,675 --> 01:03:01,610
One, two, three,
four, five, six.

566
01:03:01,612 --> 01:03:03,945
Shh, do you hear that?

567
01:03:06,549 --> 01:03:07,883
- Subway.
- Shh.

568
01:03:07,885 --> 01:03:10,619
It's Luka's asshole
screaming my name.

569
01:03:13,990 --> 01:03:15,724
I'm not interested.

570
01:03:15,726 --> 01:03:17,359
By the way, with two houses.

571
01:03:17,361 --> 01:03:19,828
- 400, what?
- You owe me $450.

572
01:03:19,830 --> 01:03:22,297
You guys are fuckin' boring.

573
01:03:22,299 --> 01:03:24,366
I'm gonna go fuck.

574
01:03:24,567 --> 01:03:26,902
Do what you do best.

575
01:03:27,370 --> 01:03:28,904
Six, seven, eight.

576
01:03:28,906 --> 01:03:31,373
Oh, I think I own that.

577
01:03:31,375 --> 01:03:35,377
Ah, no, no no no,
I was right here, on chance.

578
01:03:35,912 --> 01:03:38,814
Do you even
stop fucking things?

579
01:03:41,918 --> 01:03:43,785
Go, go again.

580
01:03:45,121 --> 01:03:46,788
Oh, "get out of jail free."

581
01:03:46,790 --> 01:03:48,190
It's nice.

582
01:03:48,424 --> 01:03:49,524
Save it.

583
01:03:49,526 --> 01:03:51,293
- Your turn.
- - Ok.

584
01:03:52,328 --> 01:03:54,963
Never Luka, never.

585
01:03:55,765 --> 01:03:56,932
This guy's crazy.

586
01:03:56,934 --> 01:03:58,433
You're a fucking pig Charlie.

587
01:03:58,435 --> 01:03:59,701
I never stop Luka.

588
01:03:59,703 --> 01:04:01,736
One, two, three, four.

589
01:04:12,114 --> 01:04:15,016
Hi you guys, how you doing?

590
01:04:15,585 --> 01:04:17,185
Good, ok cool.

591
01:04:17,187 --> 01:04:21,356
I have a little special
performance for you guys tonight.

592
01:04:21,358 --> 01:04:23,258
A little song, a little ditty,

593
01:04:23,260 --> 01:04:26,228
an old jazz standard
called, "smile."

594
01:04:26,230 --> 01:04:30,498
So I hope you enjoy it.

595
01:07:14,430 --> 01:07:15,430
Thank you.

596
01:07:19,136 --> 01:07:22,404
Thank you so much.

597
01:07:29,245 --> 01:07:30,478
Oh my god, thank you.

598
01:07:30,480 --> 01:07:31,813
No.

599
01:07:35,151 --> 01:07:36,684
Ok.

600
01:07:39,321 --> 01:07:42,424
Not looking, not looking.

601
01:11:00,055 --> 01:11:01,623
Nightmare.

602
01:11:05,394 --> 01:11:06,894
You Kim?

603
01:11:07,930 --> 01:11:09,831
Guess the same thing.

604
01:11:13,202 --> 01:11:14,836
What's going on?

605
01:11:18,007 --> 01:11:19,874
The bar's closing.

606
01:11:21,310 --> 01:11:23,478
We can't afford
the rent any more.

607
01:11:24,546 --> 01:11:27,282
Be turned into fucking
condos or something.

608
01:11:30,019 --> 01:11:32,687
Be gone in a couple of
weeks, a month maybe.

609
01:11:34,623 --> 01:11:36,758
Nobody knows.

610
01:11:55,744 --> 01:11:57,378
It's ok.

611
01:19:23,158 --> 01:19:26,093
Stop, what's wrong?

612
01:19:26,528 --> 01:19:29,163
Tell me what's wrong.

613
01:19:29,865 --> 01:19:32,133
Look at me, look at me!

614
01:19:33,468 --> 01:19:35,136
What is it?

615
01:19:41,643 --> 01:19:43,778
Talk to me.

616
01:19:44,780 --> 01:19:46,380
Please.

617
01:20:08,703 --> 01:20:10,004
Give me the knife.

618
01:20:10,006 --> 01:20:12,673
Hey baby it's ok.

619
01:20:12,675 --> 01:20:14,108
Give me the knife.

620
01:20:14,110 --> 01:20:15,209
Hey you guys I think
he needs to be left alone.

621
01:20:15,211 --> 01:20:16,744
Let go.

622
01:20:17,646 --> 01:20:19,246
Come on, look at us.

623
01:20:19,248 --> 01:20:21,816
Hey, look at me.

624
01:20:23,084 --> 01:20:25,186
It'll be fine all right.

625
01:20:26,188 --> 01:20:27,154
All right?

626
01:20:27,156 --> 01:20:29,523
Hey, you're gonna be fine.

627
01:20:30,592 --> 01:20:32,226
There's nothing out there.

628
01:20:32,228 --> 01:20:34,094
No-one's gonna hurt you.

629
01:20:34,896 --> 01:20:36,497
Thank you.

630
01:20:41,436 --> 01:20:42,703
Come on,
you're a fuckin' boxer,

631
01:20:42,705 --> 01:20:44,171
you're all right, come on.

632
01:20:46,508 --> 01:20:47,675
Charlie he's freaked out.

633
01:20:47,677 --> 01:20:48,943
I know.

634
01:20:53,215 --> 01:20:55,316
Give him some space.

635
01:21:30,318 --> 01:21:33,254
Merde! Merde, I knew it!

636
01:21:37,125 --> 01:21:38,859
You fucked up!

637
01:21:42,330 --> 01:21:43,130
What are you looking for?

638
01:21:43,132 --> 01:21:44,231
Where is it?

639
01:21:44,233 --> 01:21:45,366
I don't know.

640
01:21:45,368 --> 01:21:46,734
What knife?

641
01:21:46,736 --> 01:21:47,935
That little black one
you've been carrying around?

642
01:21:47,937 --> 01:21:49,536
I need my fucking knife!

643
01:21:50,138 --> 01:21:52,539
- What are you doing?
- Have you seen his knife?

644
01:21:52,541 --> 01:21:54,041
No I haven't, honey
calm down, it's ok.

645
01:21:54,043 --> 01:21:54,975
Who knows, who knows?

646
01:21:54,977 --> 01:21:56,143
I need it, where is it?

647
01:21:56,145 --> 01:21:57,578
You do not need a knife.

648
01:21:57,580 --> 01:22:00,247
You took it,
you took it, who took it?

649
01:22:00,249 --> 01:22:02,416
No seriously,
seriously, it's ok.

650
01:22:02,418 --> 01:22:03,684
Where is it?

651
01:22:03,686 --> 01:22:05,953
Look at me, it's ok,
we love you it's fine.

652
01:22:05,955 --> 01:22:06,887
I need my knife.

653
01:22:06,889 --> 01:22:08,455
You don't need a knife.

654
01:22:09,057 --> 01:22:10,424
- It's gonna be fine.
- - Calm down.

655
01:22:10,426 --> 01:22:11,592
I need it, I need it!

656
01:22:11,594 --> 01:22:12,594
You don't need a knife.

657
01:22:12,595 --> 01:22:13,961
I need the knife, I need it.

658
01:22:13,963 --> 01:22:15,062
Does he need a knife?

659
01:22:15,064 --> 01:22:15,863
You don't need a knife.

660
01:22:15,865 --> 01:22:17,064
I've got a reason to.

661
01:22:17,066 --> 01:22:18,232
You don't need
a knife, calm down.

662
01:22:18,234 --> 01:22:20,534
All right, just
chill, all right.

663
01:22:20,536 --> 01:22:22,236
It's ok baby.

664
01:22:24,172 --> 01:22:26,941
We told you there's
nothing wrong, all right.

665
01:22:27,309 --> 01:22:29,810
There is something wrong.

666
01:22:33,548 --> 01:22:35,082
You're fine ok.

667
01:25:07,635 --> 01:25:09,670
Please stop.

668
01:25:19,848 --> 01:25:24,118
Stop, stop it, stop it, stop.

669
01:27:21,469 --> 01:27:24,738
Don't worry, tomorrow
I'll get a car.

670
01:27:25,740 --> 01:27:28,542
I know a place where no
one will ever find him.

671
01:27:59,240 --> 01:28:02,576
- Luka.
- Yeah?

672
01:28:05,513 --> 01:28:10,150
Tonight can look at my face.

673
01:28:37,845 --> 01:28:40,213
I love you, you know that?

674
01:31:45,600 --> 01:31:48,034
My name is Maurice.

675
01:31:49,303 --> 01:31:51,738
I know I don't really exist.

676
01:31:52,440 --> 01:31:54,908
I met people who love me.

677
01:31:54,910 --> 01:31:57,344
I met people I loved.

678
01:31:57,346 --> 01:32:00,347
But I was only here for a while.

679
01:32:00,349 --> 01:32:02,849
Just for a little while.
