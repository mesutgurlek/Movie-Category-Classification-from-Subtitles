1
00:01:11,892 --> 00:01:16,409
- Ah, how's business?
- Swell. It's Garbo.

2
00:01:16,410 --> 00:01:20,917
It'll be even better next week
when you play my new Schnarzan picture.

3
00:01:20,918 --> 00:01:23,975
Ah, what a star! What a star!

4
00:01:24,010 --> 00:01:27,033
Oh, has the trailer gone on yet?

5
00:01:27,034 --> 00:01:28,910
You'll just about catch it.

6
00:01:28,911 --> 00:01:30,748
Good.

7
00:01:48,504 --> 00:01:52,224
Coming to this theatre soon

8
00:01:52,225 --> 00:01:55,400
The mighty monarch of the mudlands...

9
00:01:55,401 --> 00:01:58,603
SCHNARZAN THE CONQUEROR!

10
00:02:22,776 --> 00:02:25,493
Jungle beasts knew his call...

11
00:02:25,494 --> 00:02:30,680
The hidden terrors of the jungle
held no fear for...

12
00:02:30,681 --> 00:02:33,350
SCHNARZAN THE CONQUEROR!

13
00:03:01,118 --> 00:03:04,030
How exhilaratin'!

14
00:03:04,031 --> 00:03:10,988
Untamed, untouched, untrammeled
by civilization.

15
00:03:14,389 --> 00:03:19,244
Nature's forgotten man
who couldn't forget the call of nature.

16
00:03:20,143 --> 00:03:21,694
Can't you see jungle woman?

17
00:03:21,729 --> 00:03:24,868
I'm human even if I've got a touch
of the King Kong.

18
00:03:24,869 --> 00:03:27,622
Human? Hah! You make me laugh.

19
00:03:27,623 --> 00:03:30,896
Giving them the royal razz.

20
00:03:30,897 --> 00:03:35,470
OK, but underneath this lion's skin
beats a heart seething with sentiment.

21
00:03:35,471 --> 00:03:38,528
Oh, I bet you say that to every animal.
Go on.

22
00:03:38,529 --> 00:03:40,547
No.

23
00:03:40,548 --> 00:03:42,894
I don't.

24
00:03:42,895 --> 00:03:45,023
Listen to me, jungle woman.

25
00:03:45,024 --> 00:03:51,982
Don't miss it if you can.

26
00:03:58,183 --> 00:03:59,713
SCHNARZAN THE CONQUEROR!

27
00:03:59,878 --> 00:04:01,717
SCHNARZAN THE DANGEROUS

28
00:04:01,718 --> 00:04:06,014
Coming to this theatre soon

29
00:04:10,419 --> 00:04:11,559
Well, there's one thing certain.

30
00:04:11,560 --> 00:04:14,869
I'm not coming to this theater next week
to see that cluck Scharzan.

31
00:04:14,870 --> 00:04:17,668
You can't call my star a cluck.

32
00:04:17,669 --> 00:04:19,736
Cluck, cluck.

33
00:04:20,378 --> 00:04:22,240
There ought to be a law.

34
00:04:22,241 --> 00:04:24,982
You shouldn't allow your patrons
to say things like that.

35
00:04:24,983 --> 00:04:28,344
Well, to tell you the truth, Mr. Knapp,
Schnarzan is slipping.

36
00:04:28,345 --> 00:04:33,501
The public's fed up with those mangy, toothless,
moth-eaten lions that he's been fighting with.

37
00:04:33,502 --> 00:04:35,386
You're right. You're right.

38
00:04:35,387 --> 00:04:37,053
You'll flop with Scharzan.

39
00:04:37,054 --> 00:04:40,318
But the week after
you'll mop up with my star.

40
00:04:40,319 --> 00:04:43,357
The one and only Liondora.

41
00:04:43,358 --> 00:04:44,544
Liondora...

42
00:04:44,545 --> 00:04:47,231
That cheap imitation of the great Schnarzan.

43
00:04:47,232 --> 00:04:49,368
What are you talking about?
Schnarzan is a has-been.

44
00:04:49,369 --> 00:04:53,564
Stop arguing, Mr. Goldfarb.
Liondora is a bust too.

45
00:04:53,565 --> 00:04:56,286
He doesn't even use real lions.

46
00:04:56,287 --> 00:04:59,646
I know because one of my relatives
played the hind legs.

47
00:04:59,647 --> 00:05:03,185
But if I were you, boys,
I'd go and buy some real,

48
00:05:03,186 --> 00:05:05,450
honest to goodness, man-eaters.

49
00:05:05,451 --> 00:05:06,732
Killers!

50
00:05:06,733 --> 00:05:08,268
Give the public a thrill.

51
00:05:08,269 --> 00:05:11,546
That's the only way
you'll ever make any money.

52
00:05:16,021 --> 00:05:18,341
Real man-eaters...

53
00:05:18,826 --> 00:05:20,666
Killers...

54
00:05:20,667 --> 00:05:22,824
That's an idea.

55
00:05:22,859 --> 00:05:26,573
The little dream nest in...
THE HOLLOWS

56
00:05:38,194 --> 00:05:40,098
What a game! What a game!

57
00:05:40,099 --> 00:05:41,370
I trust you scored, sir.

58
00:05:41,371 --> 00:05:45,633
You're darn trustin' I scored.
I hit four goals and three players.

59
00:05:50,181 --> 00:05:51,564
Fetch me my slippers!

60
00:05:51,565 --> 00:05:54,338
Hiya, Knapp. What a day!

61
00:05:55,597 --> 00:05:57,525
Jimmy, this is getting serious.

62
00:05:57,526 --> 00:05:59,461
Your public is turning away from you.

63
00:05:59,462 --> 00:06:03,580
They say your lions are moth-eaten,
toothless and half of them have the mange.

64
00:06:03,581 --> 00:06:07,501
The mange, hah?
Well, they didn't get it from me.

65
00:06:08,055 --> 00:06:11,584
But look. Something's gotta be done on it.
Look at that.

66
00:06:12,901 --> 00:06:15,367
Right on the front page.

67
00:06:16,782 --> 00:06:19,050
What does it say?

68
00:06:19,532 --> 00:06:25,075
Baron Munchausen arrives in Hollywood tomorrow,
with a cargo of wild jungle beasts.

69
00:06:25,076 --> 00:06:30,194
Jimmy, this Baron has
the greatest bunch of lions in captivity.

70
00:06:30,554 --> 00:06:32,954
Well, why not get in touch with him
and use his lions?

71
00:06:32,955 --> 00:06:34,797
That's what I'm leading up to.

72
00:06:34,798 --> 00:06:39,197
Buddy Goldfarb may have
the same idea about Liondora.

73
00:06:39,198 --> 00:06:41,342
Liondora...

74
00:06:43,773 --> 00:06:45,636
My hated rival.

75
00:06:45,637 --> 00:06:48,534
Why not beat Goldfarb and Liondora to it?

76
00:06:48,535 --> 00:06:51,568
We've got to get those lions
before they do.

77
00:06:51,569 --> 00:06:53,851
Now...
When the Baron arrives...

78
00:06:53,852 --> 00:06:58,926
entertain him the same way
you did Bernard Shaw and Professor Einstein.

79
00:06:58,927 --> 00:07:01,085
You mean make the crumb my house-guest?

80
00:07:01,086 --> 00:07:02,236
Exactly!

81
00:07:02,237 --> 00:07:05,119
And don't forget...
The Baron arrives tomorrow.

82
00:07:05,120 --> 00:07:07,467
Then we'll have to work fast.

83
00:07:07,468 --> 00:07:10,883
I'll get a flock of beautiful girls
and give him a real African welcome.

84
00:07:10,884 --> 00:07:14,247
Then we'll throw the biggest affair
since the "Boston Tea Party".

85
00:07:14,248 --> 00:07:16,395
Jimmy, you're a genius!

86
00:07:16,396 --> 00:07:18,934
You took the words
right out'a my mouth.

87
00:07:18,969 --> 00:07:20,846
The great Schnarzan invites you
to a Hollywood party

88
00:07:20,881 --> 00:07:22,723
in honor of celebrating
Baron Munchausen and his lions.

89
00:07:22,724 --> 00:07:24,411
Don't be silly. Gotta date.
Gotta go to Scharzan's party.

90
00:07:24,412 --> 00:07:26,838
Have to let the bridge game wait.
Gotta go to Scharzan's party.

91
00:07:26,839 --> 00:07:28,189
It's going to be a swell affair.

92
00:07:28,190 --> 00:07:29,271
You'll be the belle of it.

93
00:07:29,272 --> 00:07:31,517
Baron's lions will be there.
The rest is really irrelevant.

94
00:07:31,518 --> 00:07:32,582
Tonight's the night.

95
00:07:32,583 --> 00:07:33,910
Tomorrow... What a headache.

96
00:07:33,911 --> 00:07:35,029
That's the hell of it.

97
00:07:35,030 --> 00:07:38,197
- Gotta go to Scharzan's.
- Gotta go to Scharzan's.

98
00:07:38,605 --> 00:07:43,257
Oh, is that you my little white dovey-dovey?
How are ya?

99
00:07:43,258 --> 00:07:46,861
Now listen to me you dirty,
big, black, snake in the bush.

100
00:07:46,862 --> 00:07:50,252
What's the idea of giving a party
and not inviting me? Heh?

101
00:07:50,253 --> 00:07:52,696
- Answer me that!
- Wait a minute. Wait a minute.

102
00:07:52,731 --> 00:07:56,117
You don't have to get sore just because
I kicked you out of my last picture!

103
00:07:56,118 --> 00:07:58,001
You don't belong to these parties!

104
00:07:58,002 --> 00:08:01,042
You get too rough! Too involved!

105
00:08:02,958 --> 00:08:04,375
That's remindin' her.

106
00:08:04,376 --> 00:08:06,044
Now let me tell you somethin'.

107
00:08:06,045 --> 00:08:10,522
The day I don't play in your pictures any more
Schnarzan will be terrible.

108
00:08:10,523 --> 00:08:13,527
What do you think of that?

109
00:08:15,324 --> 00:08:17,684
You know what I think of you?
You know what you are?

110
00:08:17,685 --> 00:08:21,373
Un stupido animale brutto...

111
00:08:23,120 --> 00:08:27,740
What's that?
You can't talk to me like that!

112
00:08:27,987 --> 00:08:30,967
And that ends another chapter in my love life.

113
00:08:50,346 --> 00:08:53,752
Hello. Here's Joan Crawford, Mr. Durante.

114
00:08:53,753 --> 00:08:55,095
Not so loud, please. No answer.

115
00:08:55,130 --> 00:08:56,890
Oh, that Hollywood party...

116
00:08:56,891 --> 00:08:58,701
Yes, Mr. Durante.
Here's Miss Jessup.

117
00:08:58,702 --> 00:09:04,848
Hello. I can't hear you.
Hello. Hello. Hello. Hello!

118
00:09:05,379 --> 00:09:07,390
Phone's busy
We're dizzy

119
00:09:07,391 --> 00:09:09,323
It's that affair

120
00:09:09,324 --> 00:09:11,901
He's going
She's going

121
00:09:11,936 --> 00:09:14,265
They're going there

122
00:09:14,266 --> 00:09:18,593
Put on your bib and tucker
Put on your soup and fish

123
00:09:18,594 --> 00:09:21,207
I'm going
You're going

124
00:09:21,208 --> 00:09:23,229
This is our dish

125
00:09:23,230 --> 00:09:25,370
Hollywood party

126
00:09:25,371 --> 00:09:27,426
Get up! Get out!
Get in there!

127
00:09:27,427 --> 00:09:29,805
Hollywood party

128
00:09:29,806 --> 00:09:32,070
Oh, nobody sleeps tonight

129
00:09:32,071 --> 00:09:34,039
Bring along your girl

130
00:09:34,040 --> 00:09:36,286
Go home with someone else's

131
00:09:36,287 --> 00:09:38,695
Forget about your girl

132
00:09:38,696 --> 00:09:40,672
Cause she's gonna do alright

133
00:09:40,673 --> 00:09:43,160
We'll be kicking our heels up

134
00:09:43,161 --> 00:09:45,400
Til the rooster is crowing

135
00:09:45,401 --> 00:09:47,609
Bring the automobiles up

136
00:09:47,610 --> 00:09:49,949
Everybody is going

137
00:09:49,950 --> 00:09:52,075
Hollywood party

138
00:09:52,076 --> 00:09:54,269
Going a mile a minute

139
00:09:54,270 --> 00:09:56,413
Hollywood party

140
00:09:56,414 --> 00:09:58,898
Nobody sleeps tonight

141
00:09:58,899 --> 00:10:00,883
Hollywood party

142
00:10:00,884 --> 00:10:03,231
Get up! Get out!
Get in there!

143
00:10:03,232 --> 00:10:05,265
Hollywood party

144
00:10:05,266 --> 00:10:07,629
Nobody sleeps tonight

145
00:10:07,630 --> 00:10:09,677
Bring along your girl

146
00:10:09,678 --> 00:10:12,043
Go home with someone else's

147
00:10:12,044 --> 00:10:14,059
What about your girl?

148
00:10:14,060 --> 00:10:16,577
She's gonna do alright

149
00:10:16,578 --> 00:10:18,689
We'll be kicking our heels up

150
00:10:18,690 --> 00:10:20,835
Til the rooster is crowing

151
00:10:20,836 --> 00:10:23,151
Bring the automobiles up

152
00:10:23,152 --> 00:10:25,144
Everybody is going

153
00:10:25,145 --> 00:10:27,380
Hollywood party

154
00:10:27,381 --> 00:10:29,562
Going a mile a minute

155
00:10:29,563 --> 00:10:31,894
Hollywood party

156
00:10:31,895 --> 00:10:34,138
Nobody sleeps tonight

157
00:10:34,139 --> 00:10:35,964
Come and wear your white tie

158
00:10:35,965 --> 00:10:37,221
It's the right tie

159
00:10:37,222 --> 00:10:39,646
For tonight I meet you

160
00:10:39,647 --> 00:10:44,223
At that noisy girlsy and boysy
Hollywood party

161
00:10:44,224 --> 00:10:47,084
All the minks and sables
Wines with labels

162
00:10:47,085 --> 00:10:48,263
Garbos-Gables

163
00:10:48,264 --> 00:10:49,471
Greet you

164
00:10:49,472 --> 00:10:54,026
Taxis send us To tremendous
Hollywood Party

165
00:10:54,027 --> 00:10:57,488
All the girls wear ermine coats
They got from men

166
00:10:57,489 --> 00:11:00,945
But tomorrow, oh...
They've gotta give them back again

167
00:11:00,946 --> 00:11:03,221
So let the laughter spring out

168
00:11:03,222 --> 00:11:04,478
Music ring out

169
00:11:04,479 --> 00:11:06,980
Satan sing out
Yeah, man

170
00:11:06,981 --> 00:11:11,188
At that crashing, furniture-smashing
Hollywood Party

171
00:11:11,189 --> 00:11:13,188
Get out. Get out.
Get any!

172
00:11:13,189 --> 00:11:15,077
Hollywood party

173
00:11:15,078 --> 00:11:17,741
Nobody sleeps tonight

174
00:11:27,970 --> 00:11:29,917
Oh, auntie,
I hear it's going to be a wonderful party.

175
00:11:29,918 --> 00:11:31,362
I'm awfully glad we came to Hollywood.

176
00:11:31,397 --> 00:11:32,422
Think of it, Harvey.

177
00:11:32,423 --> 00:11:35,896
If you hadn't known Scharzan when he was poor,
we wouldn't have been invited.

178
00:11:35,897 --> 00:11:39,125
I knew him when he didn't have
a kettle to cook in.

179
00:11:58,595 --> 00:12:00,763
Oh, I beg your pardon.

180
00:12:17,187 --> 00:12:19,693
You're right.
He does look a little nutty.

181
00:12:19,694 --> 00:12:22,493
Lobby!

182
00:12:24,657 --> 00:12:27,581
Oh, I want to thank you
for a very nice trip.

183
00:12:27,582 --> 00:12:28,924
Oh... Thank you very much.

184
00:12:28,925 --> 00:12:30,839
Not at all.

185
00:12:30,874 --> 00:12:32,698
I'd love to pick up things for you.

186
00:12:32,699 --> 00:12:35,216
Why didn't you take off your hat?

187
00:12:35,217 --> 00:12:39,459
Oh, I was afraid I couldn't get it back on
with that same air of abandon.

188
00:12:40,567 --> 00:12:41,712
Well, where did you go?

189
00:12:41,713 --> 00:12:45,033
Auntie, I... I lost my purse.

190
00:12:45,348 --> 00:12:46,650
This is Mr...

191
00:12:46,651 --> 00:12:50,448
Harvey,
we can't afford to mix with strangers.

192
00:12:50,449 --> 00:12:52,902
If we only went with our friends
we'd be pretty lonesome.

193
00:12:52,903 --> 00:12:57,983
Come, Harvey. Come, Linda.
Schnarzan will be furious.

194
00:12:59,895 --> 00:13:01,786
It's gonna be a great party.

195
00:13:01,787 --> 00:13:03,456
Come on.

196
00:13:03,915 --> 00:13:06,476
- You know why Scharzan is giving this party?
- No

197
00:13:06,477 --> 00:13:08,046
To get those lions from the Baron.

198
00:13:08,047 --> 00:13:10,814
If he gets them, Liondora,
you're through in pictures.

199
00:13:10,815 --> 00:13:12,682
Then I've got to get in that party.

200
00:13:12,683 --> 00:13:14,630
Beat Schnarzan to the punch.

201
00:13:14,631 --> 00:13:17,757
What are we gonna use for money?

202
00:13:18,515 --> 00:13:20,514
- I want a taxi.
- A yellow, sir?

203
00:13:20,515 --> 00:13:23,713
Haven't you any colors beside yellow?
How about a green or a blue?

204
00:13:23,714 --> 00:13:25,480
Oh, I just love blue.

205
00:13:25,481 --> 00:13:27,620
She looks much better in blue.

206
00:13:27,621 --> 00:13:29,360
I wonder who they are.

207
00:13:29,361 --> 00:13:31,859
Oklahoma oil doing Hollywood.

208
00:13:31,860 --> 00:13:36,348
Slug-nutty about royalty, movie stars,
titles and that sort of thing.

209
00:13:36,349 --> 00:13:38,587
Pardon me, but do you know
where the great Schnarzan lives?

210
00:13:38,588 --> 00:13:39,588
Yes, sir.

211
00:13:39,589 --> 00:13:41,673
I'm sorry, old man,
but I didn't get your name.

212
00:13:41,674 --> 00:13:42,674
Jake.

213
00:13:42,675 --> 00:13:47,132
My name is Harvey Clemp. I'm the millionaire
oil king from Clemp City, Oklahoma.

214
00:13:47,133 --> 00:13:49,830
This is my wife, Henrietta,
the Oil Queen.

215
00:13:49,831 --> 00:13:51,582
Henrietta, this is Jake.

216
00:13:51,583 --> 00:13:53,761
How do you do.

217
00:13:53,762 --> 00:13:56,381
That gives me an idea.

218
00:13:56,382 --> 00:14:01,964
Don't worry, Mr. Goldfarb.
I'll crash Schnarzan's party, all right.

219
00:14:01,965 --> 00:14:06,115
My husband is the
multi-est millionaire in Oklahoma.

220
00:14:06,116 --> 00:14:08,613
Show the man, Harvey.

221
00:14:08,614 --> 00:14:11,234
A thousand dollar bill.

222
00:14:12,333 --> 00:14:14,642
You can't do that
unless you're a millionarie.

223
00:14:14,643 --> 00:14:17,774
They'll recognize you at the party.
Everybody knows Liondora.

224
00:14:17,775 --> 00:14:20,501
Ah, but I will not be Liondora.

225
00:14:20,502 --> 00:14:25,969
I will be the Grand Royal Duke
Spiros Dimitros Nikolaus Forfoltu-Varenikos

226
00:14:25,970 --> 00:14:30,908
from southern part Europe.
Good old Peloponniesus.

227
00:14:41,561 --> 00:14:44,174
And now I'll ask one of Schnarzan's guests
to say a few words.

228
00:14:44,175 --> 00:14:46,603
Ladies and gentlemen...
Robert Young.

229
00:14:46,604 --> 00:14:49,569
Greetings, ladies and gentlemen.
Is this a party?

230
00:14:49,570 --> 00:14:52,780
You should see them pouring in
with that goofy look in their big blue eyes.

231
00:14:52,781 --> 00:14:54,239
Gorgeous girls...

232
00:14:54,240 --> 00:14:57,613
Brunettes... who once were blondes.
Blondes who were once brunettes.

233
00:14:57,648 --> 00:14:58,829
Hello.

234
00:14:58,830 --> 00:15:00,552
And here comes a little platinum.

235
00:15:00,553 --> 00:15:01,553
Hello, Pansy.

236
00:15:01,554 --> 00:15:03,094
That was a girl, not a man.

237
00:15:03,095 --> 00:15:04,630
Hello, Joan.

238
00:15:04,631 --> 00:15:07,111
Oh, is she a dream
and you should see that dream walking.

239
00:15:07,112 --> 00:15:09,455
I'm sorry.
I don't know where it is.

240
00:15:09,893 --> 00:15:11,560
And, now ladies and gentlemen,
as I was telling...

241
00:15:11,561 --> 00:15:13,993
Said... I don't know where it is.

242
00:15:13,994 --> 00:15:15,618
Lad... Oh, butler...

243
00:15:15,619 --> 00:15:17,173
Would you show this gentlemen
the swimming pool?

244
00:15:17,174 --> 00:15:18,893
- He wants to dive in.
- Yes, sir.

245
00:15:18,894 --> 00:15:21,149
- And be sure it's empty.
- Yes, sir.

246
00:15:21,150 --> 00:15:24,424
And now here's to beauty,
laughter, romance, music.

247
00:15:24,425 --> 00:15:27,278
On with the biggest party
ever given in Hollywood.

248
00:15:54,665 --> 00:15:58,481
Feelin' high

249
00:15:58,482 --> 00:16:02,912
Well, what's the use
Of feelin' low

250
00:16:02,913 --> 00:16:07,007
Now there's a reason
If you want to know why

251
00:16:07,008 --> 00:16:11,838
I'm in love
And feelin' high

252
00:16:19,632 --> 00:16:23,498
There's a reason
If you want to know why

253
00:16:23,499 --> 00:16:27,951
I'm in love
And feelin' high

254
00:16:27,952 --> 00:16:30,179
Feelin' high

255
00:16:31,797 --> 00:16:35,962
What's the use
Of feelin' low

256
00:16:35,963 --> 00:16:40,109
Off that wagon
On the town

257
00:16:40,110 --> 00:16:44,608
Gonna be up
Never down

258
00:16:52,681 --> 00:16:56,650
There's a reason
If you want to know why

259
00:16:56,651 --> 00:17:01,989
I'm in love
And feelin' high

260
00:17:03,944 --> 00:17:08,105
My friends,
I welcome you to my humble domicile.

261
00:17:08,106 --> 00:17:11,715
Tonight, let us throw
all transgression to the winds

262
00:17:11,716 --> 00:17:17,044
and enjoy ourselves
with absolute infernity.

263
00:17:36,442 --> 00:17:40,687
This may be madness to you, Harvey Clemp,
but it's baloney to me.

264
00:17:40,688 --> 00:17:42,113
Henrietta, you astound me.

265
00:17:42,114 --> 00:17:46,399
The place is littered with movie stars
and that makes some litter.

266
00:17:50,691 --> 00:17:52,615
Very artistic.

267
00:17:52,616 --> 00:17:55,837
Oh, it's wonderful.
What did you expect, auntie?

268
00:17:55,838 --> 00:18:00,747
Nobility running around.
A duke. An earl. A marquis.

269
00:18:00,748 --> 00:18:02,604
I want to hobnob with mi'luds.

270
00:18:02,605 --> 00:18:04,740
I want to rub shoulders with royalty.

271
00:18:04,741 --> 00:18:06,170
I want a title.

272
00:18:06,171 --> 00:18:09,012
How about "Came the Dawn"?

273
00:18:09,796 --> 00:18:11,533
Madame...

274
00:18:11,534 --> 00:18:13,358
Oh, this is too too divine.

275
00:18:13,359 --> 00:18:15,210
How too too distingue...

276
00:18:15,211 --> 00:18:17,145
How too too risque.

277
00:18:17,146 --> 00:18:18,783
Sorry, but I didn't catch the name.

278
00:18:18,784 --> 00:18:23,451
I am the Grand Royal Duke
Spiros Dimitros Nikolaus Forfoltu-Varenikos.

279
00:18:23,452 --> 00:18:25,474
Beg pardon,
but I still didn't get the name.

280
00:18:25,475 --> 00:18:27,553
Oh, is very easy.
Is most simplicity.

281
00:18:27,554 --> 00:18:31,937
I am the Grand Royal Duke
Spiros Dimitros Nikolaus Forfoltu-Varenikos.

282
00:18:31,938 --> 00:18:33,051
Oh, well... Let it go.

283
00:18:33,052 --> 00:18:37,580
A Grand Royal Duke?
This is the happiest moment of my life.

284
00:18:37,581 --> 00:18:39,100
This is my niece, Linda.

285
00:18:39,101 --> 00:18:42,330
This pleasure is met with for
to suffer with happiness.

286
00:18:42,331 --> 00:18:45,640
This is my millionaire husband,
Harvey Clemp.

287
00:18:45,982 --> 00:18:47,824
- Pleased to meet your...
- Grace.

288
00:18:47,859 --> 00:18:50,114
Grace? A big strapping fella like that?

289
00:18:50,115 --> 00:18:52,363
You care to honor me
with this dance?

290
00:18:52,364 --> 00:18:54,847
Oh, no honor at all.

291
00:18:54,848 --> 00:18:58,136
Harvey, don't forget to invite the Duke
to the hotel for cocktails.

292
00:18:58,137 --> 00:18:59,205
By all means.

293
00:18:59,206 --> 00:19:03,765
Oh, is be great pleasure to go to hotel
for cocktails and dinner.

294
00:19:06,758 --> 00:19:09,656
Did I say dinner?

295
00:19:12,328 --> 00:19:14,096
May I have this dance?

296
00:19:14,097 --> 00:19:16,067
Well, you'll have to ask my uncle.

297
00:19:16,068 --> 00:19:17,495
May I have this dance?

298
00:19:17,496 --> 00:19:21,489
Well, I'm a bad one to lead,
but I can follow.

299
00:19:24,238 --> 00:19:27,012
I guess I'll just drink this one out.

300
00:19:36,665 --> 00:19:39,381
- It's the Baron.
- It's the Baron.

301
00:19:39,416 --> 00:19:42,009
That's what I just said.

302
00:19:46,208 --> 00:19:48,454
Look at them wagons.

303
00:19:48,455 --> 00:19:50,755
That must be the lions.

304
00:19:50,756 --> 00:19:52,823
They all can't be the Baron.

305
00:19:52,824 --> 00:19:57,887
Remember!
I want to give him a royal welcome.

306
00:19:58,321 --> 00:20:01,193
The Baron is to get the Champagne Suite.

307
00:20:01,923 --> 00:20:06,380
You take charge of the left wing.
You take the right wing.

308
00:20:06,969 --> 00:20:09,456
I'll take the dark meat.

309
00:20:15,143 --> 00:20:17,031
This is a holiday

310
00:20:17,032 --> 00:20:18,928
No melancholy day

311
00:20:18,929 --> 00:20:20,751
This is a jolly way

312
00:20:20,752 --> 00:20:22,679
To welcome the Baron

313
00:20:22,680 --> 00:20:26,236
Who came from the Congo today

314
00:20:29,709 --> 00:20:31,819
Wait a minute! Wait a minute!

315
00:20:31,820 --> 00:20:34,597
- The Baron's coming to say hello.
- Hello!

316
00:20:34,598 --> 00:20:35,834
Yes, hello!

317
00:20:35,835 --> 00:20:37,443
Hello! Hello! Hello!

318
00:20:37,444 --> 00:20:40,256
Not hello, hello, hello
But halloo.

319
00:20:40,257 --> 00:20:41,257
Halloo!

320
00:20:41,258 --> 00:20:44,964
Say how-de-do
Mit me favor. How are you

321
00:20:44,965 --> 00:20:48,224
Press the flesh old thing or Cheerio

322
00:20:48,225 --> 00:20:51,633
Or say how's tricks or there a hi-de-ho

323
00:20:51,634 --> 00:20:54,184
Wie geitz, my friend

324
00:20:54,185 --> 00:20:56,664
Bon jour or any high hat stuff

325
00:20:56,665 --> 00:20:59,170
What a linguist! What a linguist!

326
00:20:59,171 --> 00:21:05,057
By now you outta know
The Baron's gonna say hello!

327
00:21:10,141 --> 00:21:14,172
A gunna gunna
A great ahorta

328
00:21:14,173 --> 00:21:18,003
Good afternoona
Or is it morna?

329
00:21:18,004 --> 00:21:23,592
Give the Baron an Afrikaans hello

330
00:21:25,900 --> 00:21:29,476
What's he gonna say?
What's he gonna say?

331
00:21:29,477 --> 00:21:32,255
He's coming here to say hello

332
00:21:32,256 --> 00:21:33,256
Oh, no!

333
00:21:33,257 --> 00:21:36,983
That rootin' tootin' son
Of a gun from Africa

334
00:21:36,984 --> 00:21:40,633
That prevaricating, second to none
From Africa

335
00:21:40,634 --> 00:21:42,521
He's gonna say...

336
00:21:42,979 --> 00:21:45,464
He's gonna say...

337
00:21:47,121 --> 00:21:50,195
I'm going to say...

338
00:21:50,196 --> 00:21:52,473
And so we're here.

339
00:21:52,474 --> 00:21:56,205
It has been a long walk but we here.

340
00:21:56,206 --> 00:22:02,514
Schnarzan, I bring you the most ferocious ape
ever captured in the middle of Africa.

341
00:22:02,515 --> 00:22:05,868
He is the son of King Kong.

342
00:22:05,869 --> 00:22:07,839
His name is Ping Pong.

343
00:22:07,840 --> 00:22:09,923
And look... Let papa down.

344
00:22:11,740 --> 00:22:14,440
Pingy, go to Schnarzan.

345
00:22:18,203 --> 00:22:21,386
A chimpanzee!

346
00:22:23,394 --> 00:22:26,440
Is that etiquette?

347
00:22:28,775 --> 00:22:33,656
I'm going to say... I'm going to...

348
00:22:33,657 --> 00:22:35,742
It's an honor to our nation

349
00:22:35,743 --> 00:22:37,502
To hear your salutation

350
00:22:37,503 --> 00:22:39,207
We have our celebration

351
00:22:39,208 --> 00:22:41,905
In great anticipation

352
00:22:41,906 --> 00:22:47,685
I want to say... I want to say...

353
00:22:47,686 --> 00:22:50,372
No lions made him shiver
No tigers made him quiver

354
00:22:50,373 --> 00:22:54,590
Down by the Niger river.
Where lions eat your liver

355
00:22:54,591 --> 00:23:00,571
I want to say...
I want to say...

356
00:23:05,326 --> 00:23:08,871
It really is a sensation

357
00:23:08,872 --> 00:23:12,280
A most magnificent ovation

358
00:23:12,281 --> 00:23:16,003
There's been nothing like it before

359
00:23:16,004 --> 00:23:19,532
But I really expected much more

360
00:23:20,191 --> 00:23:22,196
Please...

361
00:23:22,197 --> 00:23:25,658
I only want to say...

362
00:23:25,659 --> 00:23:28,112
He only wants to say...

363
00:23:28,113 --> 00:23:30,082
Then let me say it!

364
00:23:30,083 --> 00:23:34,672
I only want to say...

365
00:23:36,157 --> 00:23:37,907
Hello!
I fooled you!

366
00:23:37,942 --> 00:23:42,464
Oh, hello!
Hello! Hello! Hello!

367
00:23:42,465 --> 00:23:45,954
We are very glad to meet you
And we greet you with hello

368
00:23:45,955 --> 00:23:49,835
Hello! Hello! Hello!

369
00:23:50,159 --> 00:23:55,255
Greetings and salutations, Baron.
Welcome to my poor house.

370
00:23:55,256 --> 00:23:58,365
Well...
Who wants to live in a poorhouse?

371
00:23:58,366 --> 00:24:01,677
Hello, forever

372
00:24:02,037 --> 00:24:05,943
Hello, forever

373
00:24:05,944 --> 00:24:11,449
Hello! Hello! Hello!

374
00:24:16,376 --> 00:24:19,472
I never knew you cared.

375
00:24:19,473 --> 00:24:23,728
Hello!

376
00:24:33,026 --> 00:24:34,359
Look!

377
00:24:34,360 --> 00:24:36,338
Imagine coming to a party
with wild animals.

378
00:24:36,339 --> 00:24:38,673
Oh, it's thrilling.

379
00:24:40,308 --> 00:24:42,602
It's like being at the zoo.

380
00:24:42,603 --> 00:24:44,299
- Knapp!
- Jimmy!

381
00:24:44,300 --> 00:24:47,490
Everything is going to be OK.
I gave the Baron the Royal Suite.

382
00:24:47,525 --> 00:24:48,613
That's the idea.

383
00:24:48,614 --> 00:24:51,584
Treat him right, you get the lions
and your future's insured.

384
00:24:53,739 --> 00:24:55,599
Now that's what I mean.

385
00:24:55,600 --> 00:24:59,251
Imagine the kick your public will get when
they see you fighting a lion like that.

386
00:24:59,252 --> 00:25:01,788
Teeth that can bite.
Claws that can rip.

387
00:25:01,789 --> 00:25:07,043
What a kick when they see you
with your head right in his very jaws.

388
00:25:07,044 --> 00:25:09,516
He might break my neck.

389
00:25:09,517 --> 00:25:10,697
There's the thrill of it.

390
00:25:10,698 --> 00:25:14,058
I'm willing to take any risk
to make a big picture.

391
00:25:14,059 --> 00:25:16,190
You'll be the season's sensation.

392
00:25:16,191 --> 00:25:19,060
Every newspaper will print your name.

393
00:25:19,061 --> 00:25:23,845
Yeah, in the obituary column.
Let's stroll.

394
00:25:26,901 --> 00:25:30,029
Fixing a cocktail?

395
00:25:30,030 --> 00:25:32,725
You picked a nice night for it.

396
00:25:38,839 --> 00:25:42,203
Careful.
You'll scratch your face.

397
00:25:57,002 --> 00:25:58,832
Rather an informal entrance, isn't it?

398
00:25:58,833 --> 00:25:59,833
That Schnarzan...

399
00:25:59,834 --> 00:26:01,856
He thinks he can keep me away
from his party, eh?

400
00:26:01,857 --> 00:26:05,321
That dirty such and such
and so and so and this and that...

401
00:26:06,181 --> 00:26:07,752
Those are strong words, stranger.

402
00:26:07,753 --> 00:26:09,403
Wait til I get a hold of him.

403
00:26:09,404 --> 00:26:11,452
I show him how strong I am.

404
00:26:11,453 --> 00:26:14,362
I get a hold of his throat like this.

405
00:26:15,951 --> 00:26:18,923
I'd hate to be in his shoes.

406
00:26:20,331 --> 00:26:25,495
Hey! I kinda like you.
Come here.

407
00:26:33,773 --> 00:26:37,384
Oh, is beautiful... Is wonderful.

408
00:26:37,385 --> 00:26:40,420
What a night! What a night!

409
00:26:40,421 --> 00:26:45,118
Oh, the moon is so musk mellow
in the fragrance of your head.

410
00:26:45,119 --> 00:26:49,001
Oh, your Grace...
I guess I was just made for love.

411
00:26:49,002 --> 00:26:50,927
Oh, you sweet honey bunch donuts...

412
00:26:50,928 --> 00:26:54,846
You can't be for to hide your feelings
when soul is respond to soul.

413
00:26:54,847 --> 00:26:58,789
You have heart. You have fire.
You make me for to burn.

414
00:26:58,790 --> 00:26:59,790
Oh, Grace...

415
00:26:59,791 --> 00:27:03,734
Don't call me Grace.
To you I am just plain Nikolaus.

416
00:27:03,735 --> 00:27:05,408
Nikolaus...

417
00:27:05,409 --> 00:27:08,960
From souther part Europe.
Good old Peloponneisus.

418
00:27:08,961 --> 00:27:12,249
Peloponneisus?
What a beautiful name.

419
00:27:12,250 --> 00:27:14,789
How lovely... How romantic...

420
00:27:14,790 --> 00:27:16,282
Oh, Henrietta!

421
00:27:16,283 --> 00:27:18,824
You mustn't, Grace.
You mustn't. No. No.

422
00:27:18,825 --> 00:27:21,863
You mustn't call me Grace.
Call me... Call me Nikolaus.

423
00:27:21,864 --> 00:27:24,471
No... I like Peloponneisus better.

424
00:27:25,242 --> 00:27:27,280
Oh, let me for to grab your lipsky.

425
00:27:27,281 --> 00:27:30,642
No. No. Oh, no.

426
00:27:31,619 --> 00:27:33,130
I... I mustn't.

427
00:27:33,131 --> 00:27:34,782
You could just call me HC.

428
00:27:34,783 --> 00:27:38,888
Well, don't you know
any other games but the oil game?

429
00:27:38,889 --> 00:27:41,556
Yes, but I like the old oil game best.

430
00:27:41,557 --> 00:27:43,743
Mr. Clemp, come with me.
I want to show you something.

431
00:27:43,744 --> 00:27:44,947
Yes, my boy. What is it?

432
00:27:44,982 --> 00:27:46,135
It's your wife.

433
00:27:46,136 --> 00:27:48,243
Well, I've seen my wife.
In fact, I married her.

434
00:27:48,244 --> 00:27:50,694
But, Mr. Clemp...
This is important.

435
00:27:50,695 --> 00:27:53,014
Hey, HC... You're not going
to leave me here all alone?

436
00:27:53,015 --> 00:27:56,135
Don't go away. I'll be right back.
Read a book or something.

437
00:27:56,716 --> 00:27:59,032
You gorgeous crab, you.

438
00:27:59,033 --> 00:28:03,051
Always filled the cup of happiness
for all the people for to drink that.

439
00:28:03,052 --> 00:28:04,381
Yes, that's me.

440
00:28:04,382 --> 00:28:07,458
I can dish it out,
but I can't take it.

441
00:28:08,130 --> 00:28:10,913
Oh, Grace. Grace!

442
00:28:14,535 --> 00:28:16,436
That's what I wanted to show you.

443
00:28:16,437 --> 00:28:19,215
Hey, this is going to be good.

444
00:28:20,801 --> 00:28:22,877
He bit her.

445
00:28:28,410 --> 00:28:31,542
We're in a very good position.
I can see everything.

446
00:28:31,757 --> 00:28:33,544
- He kissed her.
- No!

447
00:28:33,545 --> 00:28:36,792
She responds fairly well.

448
00:28:43,420 --> 00:28:45,023
Interesting technique.

449
00:28:45,058 --> 00:28:46,281
Oh, your Grace.

450
00:28:46,282 --> 00:28:48,234
- But that's your wife.
- Oh, yes!

451
00:28:48,235 --> 00:28:50,523
That's Henrietta.
Always improving her mind.

452
00:28:51,508 --> 00:28:56,139
Never before I'm feel such terrifical
vibrations as I am feel now.

453
00:28:56,140 --> 00:29:00,934
So top tip, my delirious ducky wucky.

454
00:29:00,935 --> 00:29:04,166
I wonder how I'd do with those tactics.

455
00:29:04,167 --> 00:29:06,241
Oh, Grace.

456
00:29:13,167 --> 00:29:14,632
Oh, so you're back, eh?

457
00:29:14,667 --> 00:29:15,784
Oh what a night...

458
00:29:15,785 --> 00:29:19,530
The moon is so mellow
and the fragrance of your hair...

459
00:29:20,338 --> 00:29:23,242
Let me give you what is commonly
known as "the works".

460
00:29:23,243 --> 00:29:25,362
What's the matter with you?
Are you going crazy?

461
00:29:25,363 --> 00:29:27,793
I don't seem to have the right purchase.

462
00:29:37,978 --> 00:29:40,856
Still like the old oil game best.

463
00:29:54,812 --> 00:29:56,756
What's your name?

464
00:29:57,682 --> 00:29:59,468
You know,
there's something about you I like.

465
00:29:59,469 --> 00:30:01,495
Sure it isn't yourself?

466
00:30:01,496 --> 00:30:02,581
Oh... You got me.

467
00:30:02,582 --> 00:30:04,153
Oh, I think you'll recover.

468
00:30:04,154 --> 00:30:06,376
If you'll nurse me back to life.

469
00:30:06,377 --> 00:30:09,105
Plenty of fresh air and sunshine.

470
00:30:09,509 --> 00:30:11,943
And moonshine.

471
00:30:11,944 --> 00:30:16,140
When the moon begins to rise
My heart begins to beat

472
00:30:16,141 --> 00:30:20,543
Flowery lanes and starry skies
Have made me indiscreet

473
00:30:20,544 --> 00:30:25,047
Love affairs that come and go
Have thrilled me in the past

474
00:30:25,048 --> 00:30:31,787
But though you're not my first love
I'm sure that you're the last

475
00:30:33,361 --> 00:30:39,360
I've had my moments
I will confess

476
00:30:39,361 --> 00:30:45,137
My fleeting moments
Of tenderness

477
00:30:45,138 --> 00:30:51,292
I sang of true love
I played guitars

478
00:30:51,293 --> 00:30:56,492
Then found a new love
'neath tropical stars

479
00:30:57,372 --> 00:31:02,893
This time's the last time
This time it's new

480
00:31:02,894 --> 00:31:09,076
Love as a pastime
For me is through

481
00:31:09,077 --> 00:31:14,990
I've had my moments
My big bad moments

482
00:31:14,991 --> 00:31:19,308
But now my one big moment is you

483
00:31:21,187 --> 00:31:27,086
You've had your moments
I've had some too

484
00:31:27,087 --> 00:31:33,106
In moonlit gardens
On waters blue

485
00:31:33,107 --> 00:31:39,272
I was a siren
At seventeen

486
00:31:39,273 --> 00:31:44,834
A ball of fire
You know what I mean?

487
00:31:45,341 --> 00:31:51,275
But now I've found you
I know that's true

488
00:31:51,276 --> 00:31:57,236
I'll search around you
I'll stick like glue

489
00:31:57,237 --> 00:32:03,435
I've had my moments
My big bad moments

490
00:32:03,436 --> 00:32:07,980
But now my one big moment is you

491
00:33:13,172 --> 00:33:17,007
But now my one big moment is...

492
00:33:17,095 --> 00:33:19,242
- Me?
- You!

493
00:33:19,243 --> 00:33:22,498
I've had my moments

494
00:33:25,349 --> 00:33:28,219
My fleeting moments

495
00:33:31,271 --> 00:33:37,021
- I sang of true love
- I played guitars

496
00:33:37,022 --> 00:33:42,507
Then found a new love

497
00:33:43,672 --> 00:33:46,824
This time's the last time

498
00:33:56,116 --> 00:34:02,270
- I've had my moments
- My big bad moments

499
00:34:02,271 --> 00:34:06,907
But now my one big moment is you

500
00:34:20,676 --> 00:34:26,875
- I've had my moments
- I've had my moments

501
00:34:33,008 --> 00:34:38,969
I've had my moments
I will confess

502
00:34:38,970 --> 00:34:45,102
My fleeting moments
Of tenderness

503
00:34:45,103 --> 00:34:51,158
I sang of true love
I played guitars

504
00:34:51,159 --> 00:34:57,183
Then found a new love
'neath tropical stars

505
00:34:57,218 --> 00:35:03,208
This time's the last time
This time it's new

506
00:35:03,243 --> 00:35:09,196
Love as a pastime
For me is through

507
00:35:09,231 --> 00:35:14,631
I've had my moments

508
00:35:14,632 --> 00:35:21,630
My big bad moments

509
00:35:23,242 --> 00:35:26,626
But now my one big moment is you

510
00:35:26,627 --> 00:35:31,351
- You.
- You.

511
00:35:33,662 --> 00:35:35,304
- He'll sign it without...
- Hiya, fellas.

512
00:35:35,305 --> 00:35:36,643
- Oh, hi.
- What kept you?

513
00:35:36,644 --> 00:35:38,107
I had to work overtime.
How ya doing?

514
00:35:38,108 --> 00:35:39,108
- Swell!
- Oh, great!

515
00:35:39,109 --> 00:35:41,016
- Got the autographs yet?
- Yeah, I got a book full.

516
00:35:41,017 --> 00:35:43,189
- And you?
- If I get another one, I'll have two.

517
00:35:43,190 --> 00:35:45,482
Well, don't worry about it.
We'll have plenty before the night's over.

518
00:35:45,483 --> 00:35:47,146
Oh, this is going to be a big night.

519
00:35:47,147 --> 00:35:48,147
Well, I've got a big book.

520
00:35:49,734 --> 00:35:51,813
- Any celebrities show up?
- Sure.

521
00:35:51,814 --> 00:35:53,803
- What are you? Autograph hounds?
- Yeah!

522
00:35:53,804 --> 00:35:55,657
- Did you get any?
- Yep, I got some.

523
00:35:55,658 --> 00:35:56,658
Let me see.

524
00:35:56,659 --> 00:35:59,868
I got a whole book full. Look at this.
Will you look at this. Look at that. Look at that.

525
00:35:59,903 --> 00:36:01,915
- The stars write fast, don't they?
- Yeah!

526
00:36:01,916 --> 00:36:03,771
- You collectin' autographs?
- No...

527
00:36:03,772 --> 00:36:07,367
Collecting photographs.
No, not of you crumbs.

528
00:36:08,374 --> 00:36:10,095
- Hey, there's somebody.
- Come on.

529
00:36:10,856 --> 00:36:11,906
No, no, no, Professor.

530
00:36:11,907 --> 00:36:15,969
Your dissertation refutes
every scientific theory.

531
00:36:15,970 --> 00:36:20,794
But, Doctor, please reflect
on the profound aspects

532
00:36:20,829 --> 00:36:23,877
of the matter and consider
the vital points of my thesis.

533
00:36:23,878 --> 00:36:28,249
But, gentlemen.
Your theories are distinctly contradictory.

534
00:36:28,250 --> 00:36:29,971
Are you guys actors or hillbillies?

535
00:36:29,972 --> 00:36:32,628
Come out from under the spinach, Gable.
We know you.

536
00:36:32,629 --> 00:36:38,176
Out of the way, moron.
We are of the scientific world not thespists.

537
00:36:39,881 --> 00:36:43,404
Look, look. This proves my point.

538
00:36:43,405 --> 00:36:46,166
A perfect specimen of the Neanderthal Man.

539
00:36:46,167 --> 00:36:49,945
What? That? Oh no.
Look at the measurements.

540
00:36:49,946 --> 00:36:53,667
Look at that. Look at that.
That's the androgynous type.

541
00:36:53,668 --> 00:36:55,209
I can prove it.

542
00:36:55,210 --> 00:37:00,050
The androgynous cranium is always hollow.
Now listen.

543
00:37:00,051 --> 00:37:05,248
No, no no, Professor, you're wrong.
That is the skull of the Anthropedia.

544
00:37:05,249 --> 00:37:09,351
No, that's more like the Anthropedia.
Now, listen.

545
00:37:12,856 --> 00:37:15,844
Ah, the obvious Neanderthal type.

546
00:37:16,960 --> 00:37:19,440
Now...

547
00:37:19,776 --> 00:37:21,210
Now, just note the difference.

548
00:37:21,211 --> 00:37:22,869
Neanderthal!

549
00:37:23,369 --> 00:37:25,252
Anthropedia!

550
00:37:25,599 --> 00:37:27,416
Androgynous!

551
00:37:27,775 --> 00:37:29,494
Well, there you are!

552
00:37:30,500 --> 00:37:32,360
Hey, fellas!
Hey, fellas!

553
00:37:32,395 --> 00:37:34,620
See any prominent people?
There's a lot of prominent people here.

554
00:37:34,621 --> 00:37:36,817
Yeah, Neanderthal!

555
00:37:36,818 --> 00:37:37,818
Who?

556
00:37:37,819 --> 00:37:38,819
Androphobia!

557
00:37:38,820 --> 00:37:39,820
What?

558
00:37:39,821 --> 00:37:41,445
Androgynous!

559
00:37:41,480 --> 00:37:43,008
What, are you kidding?

560
00:37:43,009 --> 00:37:44,009
Hold it!

561
00:37:44,010 --> 00:37:45,010
Okay!

562
00:37:47,192 --> 00:37:48,847
I'll skip this joint.

563
00:37:50,399 --> 00:37:53,119
Mr. Durante is in conference.
He's not to be disturbed.

564
00:37:53,120 --> 00:37:55,332
Well, listen here.
I want to see that pelican face.

565
00:37:55,333 --> 00:37:57,000
See? And, I'm gonna disturb him.

566
00:37:57,001 --> 00:37:58,335
The scientific gentlemen are with him.

567
00:37:58,336 --> 00:38:00,495
They're having
their usual Wednesday night discussion.

568
00:38:00,496 --> 00:38:03,252
Get out of my way,
you big telegraph pole.

569
00:38:03,253 --> 00:38:05,580
I've very sorry but the door is locked.

570
00:38:05,581 --> 00:38:11,286
Is that so? Well, you keep it locked, see,
until I get a few more drinks under my belt

571
00:38:11,287 --> 00:38:15,045
and when I come back
Schnarzan's goose will be cooked.

572
00:38:15,688 --> 00:38:17,031
What about Mendelism?

573
00:38:17,032 --> 00:38:22,166
But from the Neanderthal man to the
Cardiff Giant it has been an absolute theory.

574
00:38:22,167 --> 00:38:25,105
- You are speaking pragmatically?
- Peripatetically.

575
00:38:25,106 --> 00:38:29,563
In spite of all that, you still insist
that Huxley's theory is authentic?

576
00:38:29,564 --> 00:38:31,357
Most emphatically, I do.

577
00:38:33,563 --> 00:38:35,259
I differ!

578
00:38:35,649 --> 00:38:39,065
Doing some research work
for the Smithsonian Institute,

579
00:38:39,066 --> 00:38:42,386
I was called in consultation
by Professor Eberworth.

580
00:38:42,387 --> 00:38:47,055
That emminent philuntrist who had heard
what I did for Einstein and his relatives.

581
00:38:47,056 --> 00:38:49,723
Professor Eberworth says...
Jimmy, I need you.

582
00:38:49,724 --> 00:38:54,688
I want to consult with you about a subject
which has baffled all the scientists of the world.

583
00:38:54,689 --> 00:38:57,020
Namely, reincarnation.

584
00:38:57,021 --> 00:39:00,975
Not the carnation that I am wearing
to my buttonhole. No...

585
00:39:00,976 --> 00:39:04,504
Not the carnation of a king,
but reincarnation.

586
00:39:04,505 --> 00:39:07,025
A ponderous question.

587
00:39:07,026 --> 00:39:11,016
Professor Eberworth and me being
the only two guys who knows the low-down.

588
00:39:11,017 --> 00:39:16,997
What is reincarnation you mugs, you earthworms,
you nincompoops, you chuckleheads?

589
00:39:17,461 --> 00:39:23,538
Last night with my head on my lacy pillow
I was a man dreaming I was a butterfly.

590
00:39:23,539 --> 00:39:27,697
Sipping the sap from flower to flower
just like a little butterfly.

591
00:39:27,698 --> 00:39:33,296
I had butterfly words. Butterfly desires.
Just a man dreaming I was a butterfly.

592
00:39:33,297 --> 00:39:37,835
And how do I know now that I'm not a butterfly
dreaming that I'm a man?

593
00:39:37,836 --> 00:39:40,815
Wait a minute!
I can see myself now.

594
00:39:40,816 --> 00:39:45,757
I go way back to Adam.
Adam and his madam.

595
00:39:45,758 --> 00:39:49,515
Boys, I was Adam!

596
00:39:49,550 --> 00:39:53,272
GARDEN OF EDEN

597
00:40:06,063 --> 00:40:10,956
One, two, three, four, five.
There's a rib missing.

598
00:40:11,462 --> 00:40:13,972
They promised me a woman for that rib.

599
00:40:13,973 --> 00:40:16,205
There's something screwy around here.

600
00:40:16,206 --> 00:40:19,537
Where's that beautiful baby doll?

601
00:40:21,592 --> 00:40:24,052
Oh, daddy...

602
00:40:26,397 --> 00:40:30,456
A carbon copy! I've been ribbed!

603
00:40:30,457 --> 00:40:34,295
Reincarnation works in wonderous ways.

604
00:40:34,296 --> 00:40:38,806
Like in the American Revolutionary days
in 1775.

605
00:40:38,807 --> 00:40:43,218
Hardly a man is now alive.
Not even you, old buzzards.

606
00:40:43,219 --> 00:40:47,068
I was! I was...

607
00:40:48,049 --> 00:40:53,190
Paul Revere! Paul Revere!

608
00:41:00,876 --> 00:41:07,083
Good old horse. How many more miles
have you got in your system?

609
00:41:09,502 --> 00:41:12,133
I gotta million of them.

610
00:41:17,257 --> 00:41:24,169
Put that underneath your hatta
A man has more lives than a catta

611
00:41:24,527 --> 00:41:30,129
Those episodes in my career are just
A demonstration of three little words

612
00:41:30,130 --> 00:41:33,315
Re - Ink - Carnation

613
00:41:38,102 --> 00:41:42,284
Mr. Clemp,
if you make for to get those lions

614
00:41:42,285 --> 00:41:47,283
is being terrifical pleasure for
to let you produce pictures with me.

615
00:41:47,284 --> 00:41:48,643
Come, come, Peloponnesius.

616
00:41:48,644 --> 00:41:51,913
You don't mean that you'll let me invest
some of my money in your screen offerings?

617
00:41:51,914 --> 00:41:57,105
I do better is that.
I let you invest for all money.

618
00:41:57,106 --> 00:41:59,693
Sounds like a good opportunity.

619
00:42:00,131 --> 00:42:04,170
There is the Baron now.
Make him an offer.

620
00:42:05,844 --> 00:42:07,177
Well, Baron...

621
00:42:07,178 --> 00:42:10,604
I'm prepared to offer you
50.000 dollars for your lions.

622
00:42:10,605 --> 00:42:13,910
- Will you take it?
- I take 50.000 for anything.

623
00:42:15,504 --> 00:42:16,924
Beg your pardon, but we haven't met.

624
00:42:16,925 --> 00:42:18,782
I'm Harvey Clemp, the oil king.

625
00:42:18,783 --> 00:42:21,838
Look...
A thousand dollar bill.

626
00:42:22,404 --> 00:42:24,230
You can't do that
unless you're a multi-millionarire.

627
00:42:24,231 --> 00:42:25,446
A millionaire!

628
00:42:25,447 --> 00:42:27,339
Somebody give him a slipper.
Quick.

629
00:42:27,340 --> 00:42:28,802
Gracie, move over.
Sit down, will you please.

630
00:42:28,803 --> 00:42:30,256
Some champagne in a glass.

631
00:42:30,257 --> 00:42:32,768
Now, Baron,
don't forget our deal is on.

632
00:42:32,769 --> 00:42:36,596
Deliver the lions to the studio in the morning
and get our check for fifty grand.

633
00:42:36,597 --> 00:42:37,597
I will. Thank you.

634
00:42:37,598 --> 00:42:39,314
I'll give sixty.

635
00:42:39,315 --> 00:42:40,732
- I'll make it seventy.
- Eighty.

636
00:42:40,733 --> 00:42:41,885
- Ninety.
- A hundred.

637
00:42:41,886 --> 00:42:43,248
- A hundred and ten.
- A hundred and thirty.

638
00:42:43,249 --> 00:42:44,773
Wait!
You skipped a hundred and twenty.

639
00:42:44,774 --> 00:42:46,423
- A hundred and twenty.
- A hundred and ten.

640
00:42:46,424 --> 00:42:47,424
- A hundred.
- Ninety.

641
00:42:47,425 --> 00:42:48,425
- Eighty.
- Seventy.

642
00:42:48,426 --> 00:42:50,219
Wait, gentlemen.
You're going backward.

643
00:42:50,220 --> 00:42:52,366
We were up to a hundred thirty thousand.

644
00:42:52,367 --> 00:42:54,058
So we were.
I'll make it a hundred and forty.

645
00:42:54,059 --> 00:42:56,707
I'll make it a hundred and fifty
and that's all we can afford.

646
00:42:56,708 --> 00:43:00,800
Could I hear a hundred sixty?
A hundred fifty-five?

647
00:43:01,592 --> 00:43:02,735
Waiting.

648
00:43:04,153 --> 00:43:07,042
Could I, please, hear hundred fifty-five?

649
00:43:08,842 --> 00:43:10,360
I'd rather make it a hundred seventy-five.

650
00:43:10,361 --> 00:43:14,958
Sold! Sold to the gentleman on my right
for one hundred seventy-five thousand dollars.

651
00:43:16,084 --> 00:43:19,311
I want to congratulate you, Baron.
I think you made a mighty good sale there.

652
00:43:21,037 --> 00:43:23,237
A mouse!

653
00:43:26,829 --> 00:43:28,672
There it is!

654
00:43:28,932 --> 00:43:32,916
Mousey, mousey, mousey.
Nice mousey, mousey, mousey.

655
00:43:35,337 --> 00:43:39,691
- It's Mickey Mouse!
- Oh, Mickey Mouse!

656
00:43:39,692 --> 00:43:43,010
Hey, you! Let go of my tail!

657
00:43:53,745 --> 00:43:56,683
An impostor! Stealin' my stuff!

658
00:43:56,684 --> 00:43:59,498
How mortifyin'! How mortifyin'!

659
00:43:59,499 --> 00:44:03,143
He ain't get the feeling
and a guest in my own domicile.

660
00:44:05,009 --> 00:44:06,325
Fightin' words...

661
00:44:06,326 --> 00:44:09,060
My mansion ain't big enough
for the both of us.

662
00:44:09,061 --> 00:44:12,275
Okay, pal.
You wouldn't throw me out, would you?

663
00:44:12,276 --> 00:44:14,391
I wouldn't, hah? Watch me!

664
00:44:28,865 --> 00:44:31,894
- Do something, Mickey!
- Yeah!

665
00:44:55,955 --> 00:45:01,468
Hey, Mickey! Cut out the adagios
and play something to the level of these mugs.

666
00:45:01,503 --> 00:45:03,720
THE HOT CHOC-LATE SOLDIERS

667
00:45:41,256 --> 00:45:45,533
Look at the brave hot chocolate soldiers
Marching away to war

668
00:45:45,534 --> 00:45:49,326
Followed by more hot chocolate soldiers
Fresh from the candy store

669
00:45:49,327 --> 00:45:53,330
Look at the band that's going with them
Look at the drums they've got

670
00:45:53,331 --> 00:45:57,130
Marching in syncopated rhythm
Rhythm that makes it hot

671
00:45:57,131 --> 00:46:01,338
Here they come. Here they come
With a candy fife and a chocolate drum

672
00:46:01,339 --> 00:46:05,067
Here they come. Here they come
With their tummies full of rum

673
00:46:05,528 --> 00:46:09,329
Look at those lovely chocolate ladies
Giving a parting sigh

674
00:46:09,330 --> 00:46:13,329
Tillies and Flo's and Kates and Sadies
Throwing a kiss goodbye

675
00:46:13,330 --> 00:46:17,498
Listen to me, hot chocolate soldier
Hide from the blazing sun

676
00:46:17,499 --> 00:46:21,583
Don't get too hot, hot chocolate soldier
Til the battle's won

677
00:46:27,543 --> 00:46:33,129
They're off to fight
The battle of vanilla-roma

678
00:46:33,130 --> 00:46:35,165
Over there

679
00:46:35,240 --> 00:46:39,221
They crossed the springs and mountain tops
And through the fields of lollipops

680
00:46:39,222 --> 00:46:43,240
It's war! It's war!
The popguns roar

681
00:46:43,241 --> 00:46:47,191
From planes to strand
And candy hight

682
00:46:47,192 --> 00:46:51,411
They'll bomb the foe
With cracker-jack

683
00:46:51,412 --> 00:46:55,394
They're off to fight
Those great big gingerbread men

684
00:46:55,395 --> 00:46:58,975
And they'll come marching home

685
00:49:20,719 --> 00:49:24,639
Look at the brave hot chocolate soldiers
Marching away from war

686
00:49:24,640 --> 00:49:28,409
Followed by more hot chocolate soldiers
Back to the candy store

687
00:49:28,410 --> 00:49:32,565
Look at the band that's coming with them
Look at the drums they've got

688
00:49:32,566 --> 00:49:36,422
Marching in syncopated rhythm
Rhythm that makes it hot

689
00:49:36,423 --> 00:49:40,438
Here they come. Here they come
With a candy fife and a chocolate drum

690
00:49:40,439 --> 00:49:44,603
Here they come. Here they come
With their tummies full of rum

691
00:49:44,604 --> 00:49:48,468
Look at those lovely chocolate ladies
Waving to greet their men

692
00:49:48,469 --> 00:49:52,578
Tillies and Flo's and Kates and Sadies
Happy as brides again

693
00:49:52,579 --> 00:49:56,528
Listen to me, hot chocolate soldier
Hide from the blazing sun

694
00:49:56,529 --> 00:50:01,226
Don't get too hot, hot chocolate soldier
Now the battle's won

695
00:50:28,759 --> 00:50:31,148
Jimmy... We're in trouble.

696
00:50:31,149 --> 00:50:33,845
Harvey Clemp bought those lions
from the Baron.

697
00:50:33,846 --> 00:50:35,472
He outbid me.

698
00:50:35,473 --> 00:50:38,146
Liondora had a hand in this.
The rat!

699
00:50:38,147 --> 00:50:40,523
We've got to get those lion back.

700
00:50:45,799 --> 00:50:49,292
My big bad moments

701
00:50:58,863 --> 00:51:00,706
That's Clemp's wife.

702
00:51:00,707 --> 00:51:02,294
Poor Clemp.

703
00:51:02,295 --> 00:51:05,893
Here's where you come in.
Get busy with Mrs. Clemp. Do your stuff.

704
00:51:05,894 --> 00:51:07,924
You mean Don Juan?

705
00:51:07,925 --> 00:51:09,977
You're better than Don Juan.

706
00:51:09,978 --> 00:51:12,336
I'm Don Two.

707
00:51:12,337 --> 00:51:15,009
I got my work cut out for me.

708
00:51:17,308 --> 00:51:19,005
I wonder who it is.

709
00:51:19,006 --> 00:51:20,693
Maybe the Barrymores.

710
00:51:20,694 --> 00:51:22,326
Perhaps it's Garbo.

711
00:51:42,818 --> 00:51:44,042
What do you want?

712
00:51:44,043 --> 00:51:47,454
We'd like to see the Baron.
Baron Munchausen.

713
00:51:47,455 --> 00:51:48,586
What's your business?

714
00:51:48,587 --> 00:51:50,051
Well, you see, sir...
It goes like this.

715
00:51:50,052 --> 00:51:54,233
He bought some lions from us.
And paid us with a check.

716
00:51:54,234 --> 00:51:57,977
Yes and we've been all over town
trying to cash it.

717
00:52:12,707 --> 00:52:15,419
Fifty thousand tiddly-winks?

718
00:52:15,420 --> 00:52:20,268
Yes, sir. The Baron told us that a tiddly-wink
was worth a dollar and a half in his country.

719
00:52:20,269 --> 00:52:23,893
That is, you understand,
at the present rate of exchange.

720
00:52:25,022 --> 00:52:27,656
You guys are screwy!

721
00:52:40,561 --> 00:52:41,874
Now, listen...

722
00:52:41,875 --> 00:52:48,213
If you guys ring that bell again, I'll break
your arm off and stuff it down your throat.

723
00:53:09,560 --> 00:53:11,761
Who rang the bell?

724
00:53:12,645 --> 00:53:14,675
I did.

725
00:53:24,600 --> 00:53:27,913
- Are you going to stand for that?
- I should say not!

726
00:53:27,914 --> 00:53:29,309
He can't bluff me.

727
00:53:29,310 --> 00:53:32,463
I'm going to see the Baron
if I have to stay here all night.

728
00:53:32,464 --> 00:53:35,726
I'll give him his check
and take back our lions.

729
00:53:35,727 --> 00:53:39,909
That's a good idea.
We can get along without his old piddly-winks.

730
00:53:39,910 --> 00:53:41,319
Certainly.

731
00:53:41,320 --> 00:53:42,711
We don't want...

732
00:53:42,712 --> 00:53:47,385
Not piddly-winks...
Tiddly-winks.

733
00:53:47,991 --> 00:53:50,152
Piddly-winks...

734
00:54:10,433 --> 00:54:12,468
Now, if you come ba...

735
00:54:36,830 --> 00:54:39,472
Oh, Baron!

736
00:54:40,014 --> 00:54:42,449
Baron Munchausen!

737
00:54:45,142 --> 00:54:47,515
Don't be rude.

738
00:54:54,117 --> 00:54:56,583
Oh, Baron!

739
00:54:58,029 --> 00:55:02,167
Oh, Baron!

740
00:55:07,881 --> 00:55:10,394
Pardon us, folks.

741
00:55:12,905 --> 00:55:17,648
I've had my moments

742
00:56:08,619 --> 00:56:13,430
I've had my moments

743
00:56:13,431 --> 00:56:16,221
I will confess

744
00:56:17,422 --> 00:56:23,921
My fleeting moments
Of tenderness

745
00:56:25,552 --> 00:56:30,190
I sang of true love

746
00:56:31,194 --> 00:56:34,620
I played guitars

747
00:56:36,976 --> 00:56:40,587
Then found a new love

748
00:56:40,588 --> 00:56:45,334
'neath tropical stars

749
00:56:46,630 --> 00:56:48,736
An infant prodigy.

750
00:56:48,737 --> 00:56:52,637
This time's the last time

751
00:56:53,159 --> 00:56:56,614
This time it's new

752
00:56:57,115 --> 00:57:01,095
Love as a pastime

753
00:57:01,096 --> 00:57:03,713
For me is through

754
00:57:03,714 --> 00:57:05,676
Your stomach notes are beautiful.

755
00:57:05,677 --> 00:57:09,548
I've had my moments

756
00:57:10,762 --> 00:57:15,335
My big bad moments

757
00:57:17,125 --> 00:57:19,744
Rubenstein's melody intact.

758
00:57:19,745 --> 00:57:26,741
But now my one big moment is you

759
00:57:26,742 --> 00:57:28,384
You've got me under your spell.

760
00:57:28,385 --> 00:57:31,076
Please continue but in a lighter vein.

761
00:57:38,869 --> 00:57:41,511
A new style of singing.

762
00:57:47,114 --> 00:57:49,756
What stirrin' words...

763
00:57:50,696 --> 00:57:52,578
What diction...

764
00:58:10,899 --> 00:58:13,520
For posterity.

765
00:58:21,059 --> 00:58:24,938
I've had my moments

766
00:58:25,489 --> 00:58:27,527
I'm convinced.

767
00:58:27,528 --> 00:58:31,811
My big bad moments

768
00:58:31,812 --> 00:58:34,605
You're the biggest thing since Canera.

769
00:58:34,606 --> 00:58:41,561
But now my one big moment is you

770
00:58:46,215 --> 00:58:49,669
I'm gonna take you under my wing.
And develop you.

771
00:58:49,704 --> 00:58:53,045
Do you think my personality and figure
will appeal to the public?

772
00:58:53,046 --> 00:58:56,643
You'll know them for a gool I tell you.
You'll be a double feature.

773
00:58:56,644 --> 00:59:01,511
Won't Clemp City be amazed!
Maybe I'll be America's Sweetheart.

774
00:59:01,512 --> 00:59:05,890
You'll be everybody's sweetheart.
Your picture will be on every ash can.

775
00:59:06,681 --> 00:59:10,130
My dream producer...

776
00:59:11,841 --> 00:59:15,458
Ah... Pardon me.
Have you seen Baron Munchausen?

777
00:59:15,459 --> 00:59:17,397
Oh yes. Many times.

778
00:59:17,744 --> 00:59:19,179
I want some service.

779
00:59:19,180 --> 00:59:23,765
Mr. Durante says, Miss Velez, that if you came to
this party you weren't to have anything to drink.

780
00:59:23,766 --> 00:59:26,363
I don't care whatever he say!
I want service!

781
00:59:26,364 --> 00:59:27,545
I know, but he said no more tonight.

782
00:59:27,546 --> 00:59:29,050
I don't care!

783
00:59:45,347 --> 00:59:47,481
You keep out of this.

784
00:59:56,507 --> 00:59:58,643
Oh, so you want to strike me?

785
01:02:46,837 --> 01:02:48,725
Sit down. I wanna talk to you.

786
01:02:48,726 --> 01:02:51,102
Alright, but make it snappy.

787
01:03:33,511 --> 01:03:35,683
There they are.

788
01:04:03,558 --> 01:04:08,859
How can I ever repay you?
If I've got anything you want, just ask for it.

789
01:04:08,860 --> 01:04:10,843
- Anything?
- Anything.

790
01:04:10,844 --> 01:04:14,618
Then get your husband to give me those lions.
I've gotta get some lions to fight with.

791
01:04:14,619 --> 01:04:18,362
It's my career.
I must find a lion to replace Anatole.

792
01:04:18,363 --> 01:04:19,579
Anatole?

793
01:04:19,580 --> 01:04:21,767
That's Anatole.

794
01:04:21,768 --> 01:04:23,735
I owe my success to him.

795
01:04:23,736 --> 01:04:27,048
He was the first lion I ever conquered
with my bare fist.

796
01:04:27,049 --> 01:04:29,023
I beat him to a rug.

797
01:04:29,024 --> 01:04:31,967
Anatole came charging me
from behind a tree.

798
01:04:31,968 --> 01:04:35,465
I gave the famous Schnarzan call,
and then...

799
01:04:35,466 --> 01:04:36,956
And then, I leaped.

800
01:04:36,957 --> 01:04:38,464
I got him by the throat.

801
01:04:38,465 --> 01:04:40,259
It was me or the lion.

802
01:04:40,260 --> 01:04:45,828
I gave him the jungle jai-jitsi...
And then Anatole was a dead cat.

803
01:04:46,632 --> 01:04:49,433
It was another Schnarzan triumph.

804
01:04:49,434 --> 01:04:52,186
Just another chapter in my memory book.

805
01:04:52,187 --> 01:04:54,931
I have no fear of man,
woman or beast.

806
01:04:54,932 --> 01:04:56,684
Just the way of the Durantes.

807
01:04:56,685 --> 01:04:59,550
And after you conquered Anatole,
what did you do?

808
01:04:59,551 --> 01:05:03,388
I gave him a chance to rest
and then I pounced on him again.

809
01:05:05,339 --> 01:05:08,994
He got immune!
I'm double crossed. Oh...

810
01:05:11,918 --> 01:05:13,538
You, big brute!

811
01:05:15,537 --> 01:05:17,647
I like it on top.

812
01:05:18,203 --> 01:05:21,407
I'll mangle you...
from bone to bone.

813
01:05:24,989 --> 01:05:27,396
There's no room for both of us.

814
01:05:43,223 --> 01:05:45,416
Hollywood Party!
Hollywood Party! Hollywood Party!

815
01:05:45,417 --> 01:05:47,861
Hollywood Party!

816
01:05:49,487 --> 01:05:51,679
Going a mile a minute

817
01:05:51,680 --> 01:05:53,597
Hollywood Party

818
01:05:53,598 --> 01:05:56,116
Nobody sleeps tonight

819
01:05:56,117 --> 01:05:58,130
Hollywood Party

820
01:05:58,131 --> 01:06:00,443
Get up! Get out!
Get in there!

821
01:06:00,444 --> 01:06:02,392
Hollywood Party

822
01:06:02,588 --> 01:06:04,980
Nobody sleeps tonight

823
01:06:38,417 --> 01:06:42,280
But now my one big moment is...

824
01:06:42,281 --> 01:06:44,542
- Me?
- You!

825
01:07:02,534 --> 01:07:07,024
Hollywood Party
Hollywood Party

826
01:07:17,983 --> 01:07:20,294
Jimmy!

827
01:07:21,720 --> 01:07:23,252
Jimmy, wake up!

828
01:07:23,253 --> 01:07:25,593
Oh...
Who is it?

829
01:07:26,765 --> 01:07:28,052
Oh, it's you.

830
01:07:28,053 --> 01:07:29,360
What's the matter?

831
01:07:29,361 --> 01:07:32,249
You frightened me, honey.
I was just dreamin'.

832
01:07:32,250 --> 01:07:36,124
You've been sleeping an hour.
Come on. We'll be late for Lupe's party.

833
01:07:36,125 --> 01:07:38,137
- Come on, dear.
- Jean...

834
01:07:40,549 --> 01:07:43,588
Tell me...
Do I look like a horse's head?

835
01:07:43,589 --> 01:07:46,894
No, Jimmy.
Not like a horse's head.

836
01:07:46,895 --> 01:07:49,460
Come on, toots.

837
01:07:58,934 --> 01:08:05,873
THE END
