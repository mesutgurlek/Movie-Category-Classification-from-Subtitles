--Terkel in Trouble--

3
00:01:25,910 --> 00:01:27,023
Hi children!
Are you comfortable?

4
00:01:27,126 --> 00:01:32,763
My name is Arne and I'm going to tell you
a story about a boy I know called Terkel

5
00:01:39,041 --> 00:01:42,359
Terkel is a healthy boy, except from
when he is sick of course

6
00:01:42,453 --> 00:01:45,723
But he's a good kid
and he's got bones in the nose

7
00:01:46,334 --> 00:01:49,211
Now you might think:
"bones in the nose? That hurts?"

8
00:01:49,461 --> 00:01:52,560
but that's just somthing you say about
a person who is intelligent

9
00:01:53,255 --> 00:01:55,765
or about people who sneezes while
they're eating fish

10
00:01:56,242 --> 00:01:57,297
Anyways...

11
00:01:57,542 --> 00:02:02,832
Terkel lived in a small town in a red house
together with his mom Beate and his dad Leon

12
00:02:03,310 --> 00:02:05,829
Beate and Leon were pretty fair parents

13
00:02:06,201 --> 00:02:09,340
they just had a tiny bit of a problem
agreeing about stuff

14
00:02:09,765 --> 00:02:10,720
..and that's the way it is!

15
00:02:10,787 --> 00:02:11,312
No

16
00:02:11,342 --> 00:02:12,060
Yes it is

17
00:02:12,083 --> 00:02:12,590
No

18
00:02:12,522 --> 00:02:13,466
Yes!

19
00:02:13,524 --> 00:02:14,051
No!

20
00:02:14,049 --> 00:02:16,762
Mom and dad, can't you stop
discussing all the time?

21
00:02:16,841 --> 00:02:19,340
Terkel we're not discussing,
we're quarreling, right?

22
00:02:19,610 --> 00:02:20,530
No...
Yes we are!

23
00:02:20,778 --> 00:02:22,093
No!
Yes we most certainly are!

24
00:02:22,166 --> 00:02:29,003
...

25
00:02:29,272 --> 00:02:30,065
Yeeeees...!

26
00:02:30,754 --> 00:02:32,543
Terkel also had a little sister

27
00:02:32,700 --> 00:02:33,744
Hey Terkel...

28
00:02:35,288 --> 00:02:38,321
Her name was Rita.
Not now Rita, I'm busy

29
00:02:38,889 --> 00:02:41,061
Weren't we supposed to go to
school together?

30
00:02:41,390 --> 00:02:43,641
Yes... we were NOT supposed to
go together

31
00:02:49,572 --> 00:02:52,984
Terkel was in 6th grade at
Kastanjevangen School

32
00:02:53,243 --> 00:02:55,005
His best friend is Jason

33
00:02:55,224 --> 00:02:55,924
Hey what's up Terkel...!

34
00:03:04,254 --> 00:03:06,481
How's it hanging, dude?
Are you "fresh"?

35
00:03:06,468 --> 00:03:09,080
Yeah... I just haven't made my
arithmetic homework

36
00:03:09,365 --> 00:03:10,242
Ah nasty shit...

37
00:03:10,542 --> 00:03:11,776
but on the other side...
Fuck it!

38
00:03:12,662 --> 00:03:14,582
Jason came from Albertslund
(rough neighborhood)

39
00:03:14,602 --> 00:03:16,919
That's why he talked a bit
differently

40
00:03:17,170 --> 00:03:20,302
And that's also why he always
carried an iron pipe in his pocket

41
00:03:28,044 --> 00:03:30,241
Ah bummer! There's Johanna

42
00:03:32,363 --> 00:03:34,374
Haha, she's allready seen you Jason

43
00:03:35,104 --> 00:03:35,881
Hey Jason

44
00:03:36,492 --> 00:03:37,532
What's up Johanna?

45
00:03:39,868 --> 00:03:41,136
How... how's it going?

46
00:03:41,824 --> 00:03:43,543
"how's it going?" ?!

47
00:03:44,410 --> 00:03:47,825
Ermm...
Bye bye...

48
00:03:47,942 --> 00:03:49,328
But Jason...
Goodbye Johanna

49
00:03:50,085 --> 00:03:52,146
She's completely in to you
Yeah, I know

50
00:03:52,781 --> 00:03:57,249
It's just that she talks so weird
that it makes me trip - easy there

51
00:03:57,400 --> 00:04:01,679
There were also 2 really mean boys
in Terkel and Jason's class

52
00:04:01,928 --> 00:04:03,699
They were called Sten and Saki

53
00:04:03,830 --> 00:04:08,824
They used most of their recess' on
bullying a chubby girl named Dorit

54
00:04:09,747 --> 00:04:10,351
Cool Sten

55
00:04:12,317 --> 00:04:15,484
What's up Porky Pig... you fat today?
Again today!

56
00:04:15,981 --> 00:04:17,921
I swear, chubby Dorit is always fat,
haha

57
00:04:21,425 --> 00:04:27,307
Friday morning's program was music with
the class' favourite teacher Arne Nougatbranch

58
00:04:27,573 --> 00:04:29,903
Hehe, believe it or not, that's me!

59
00:04:30,048 --> 00:04:33,988
So you'll have to excuse me
while I attend my job

60
00:04:35,952 --> 00:04:37,971
Hello kids!
It's time for music class

61
00:04:38,744 --> 00:04:39,347
Err, are you ready?
Yeah...!

62
00:04:42,088 --> 00:04:44,602
Good, now listen ... err Silas?

63
00:04:45,294 --> 00:04:49,729
I studied my grandfather's
Encyclopedia of Music this weekend

64
00:04:50,026 --> 00:04:53,778
and there I saw the expression "funky"

65
00:04:53,845 --> 00:04:55,948
What does it mean?

66
00:04:56,026 --> 00:05:00,370
Listen up kids... music isn't
supposed to be read or analysed

67
00:05:00,642 --> 00:05:02,642
Music is supposed to be tasted and felt,

68
00:05:02,650 --> 00:05:06,123
to be listened and danced to.
There's music in everything

69
00:05:06,760 --> 00:05:08,622
For instance Jason's iron pipe

70
00:05:09,011 --> 00:05:12,591
Or in Solveigh's cellular phone
that rings in class

71
00:05:12,687 --> 00:05:17,001
Well kids! Let's get some
instruments and fire it up

72
00:05:18,672 --> 00:05:20,910
That's the way Jason
That's a good beat

73
00:05:22,082 --> 00:05:23,529
...the guitar is mine!

74
00:05:25,307 --> 00:05:26,870
2, 3, 4...

75
00:05:29,061 --> 00:05:31,195
Birte a bit more groovy please

76
00:05:35,020 --> 00:05:36,039
We're rolling..!

77
00:05:36,119 --> 00:05:40,001
"The name is Arne"
"And I like music"

78
00:05:40,338 --> 00:05:44,669
"I teach 6A in rhythmics"

79
00:05:45,282 --> 00:05:49,183
"The whole class is pumping"
"And everybody's in"

80
00:05:49,847 --> 00:05:53,748
"And when the beat is on"
"I'll go fetch my bass"

81
00:05:53,883 --> 00:05:58,764
"Suddenly we're all sent away"
"And all the kids sing along"

82
00:05:59,076 --> 00:06:01,532
"Arne is way cool!"

83
00:06:02,038 --> 00:06:03,168
Thanks children

84
00:06:03,561 --> 00:06:06,127
"Arne is way cool!"

85
00:06:06,496 --> 00:06:08,140
"I'm too coool!"

86
00:06:10,326 --> 00:06:12,624
Casper remember to empty the
saliva valve

87
00:06:17,012 --> 00:06:21,217
"When you look at me"
"You'll know what to expect"

88
00:06:21,446 --> 00:06:25,857
"The man with wide velvetpants"
"And with beatles hair"

89
00:06:26,207 --> 00:06:30,192
"The women want me"
"And they can't get enough"

90
00:06:30,608 --> 00:06:34,622
"When I pass by them"
"They all go crazy"

91
00:06:35,453 --> 00:06:39,842
"I'm doing lots of beautyful chicks"
"They rip my cloths off and cry:"

92
00:06:40,115 --> 00:06:42,881
"Arne he's too cool!"

93
00:06:43,126 --> 00:06:44,529
"Way cool!"

94
00:06:44,700 --> 00:06:47,051
"Arne is way cool!"

95
00:06:47,403 --> 00:06:49,827
"Uhoho coool!"

96
00:06:51,930 --> 00:06:53,242
"Super cool"

97
00:06:58,148 --> 00:07:01,044
"Arne he's too cool!"

98
00:07:05,216 --> 00:07:08,568
"I'm too cool for myself"

99
00:07:12,652 --> 00:07:13,866
That's music!

100
00:07:14,441 --> 00:07:15,602
Thanks a lot kids

101
00:07:16,246 --> 00:07:18,160
Have a nice...
Silas, thank you!

102
00:07:19,352 --> 00:07:20,219
It swings

103
00:07:20,201 --> 00:07:21,210
Silas...!

104
00:07:21,687 --> 00:07:22,227
Thank you!

105
00:07:52,101 --> 00:07:54,577
You wont beat my record, will you?
Hang on for 2 seconds...

106
00:07:55,102 --> 00:07:55,886
Fuck!

107
00:07:56,490 --> 00:07:57,800
Are you... grrrr

108
00:08:03,262 --> 00:08:04,434
Hi there kids

109
00:08:06,999 --> 00:08:08,791
What's up?
Hello there

110
00:08:09,082 --> 00:08:11,185
Actually you're sitting on a spider

111
00:08:11,533 --> 00:08:13,306
Am I...?
Yeah, look!

112
00:08:13,665 --> 00:08:14,268
Where?

113
00:08:14,615 --> 00:08:15,988
Right there
It's totally squashed

114
00:08:16,364 --> 00:08:18,505
Don't worry. It's just pants

115
00:08:19,336 --> 00:08:22,804
They can be washed.
Tell me boys, what class are you in?

116
00:08:23,179 --> 00:08:26,480
6A... in your face
Hmm I see

117
00:08:26,924 --> 00:08:29,505
It's because I'm a new substitute
teacher here in the school

118
00:08:29,799 --> 00:08:33,806
My name is Gunnar and I'm supposed
to teach 7B so...

119
00:08:34,277 --> 00:08:35,053
Okay...

120
00:08:37,067 --> 00:08:38,920
What are your names boys?

121
00:08:39,389 --> 00:08:41,429
My name is Terkel
And I'm Jason, dude

122
00:08:41,595 --> 00:08:45,540
Terkel and Jason, greetings kids.
I have to go, take care

123
00:08:45,830 --> 00:08:47,243
Yeah, 100%, dude

124
00:08:48,249 --> 00:08:50,531
He was pretty fucked up

125
00:08:50,609 --> 00:08:53,487
Yeah, a bit weird but kind of nice,
right?

126
00:08:53,805 --> 00:08:55,186
What's up fuckface?

127
00:08:55,564 --> 00:08:57,960
I just have to pee.
Fair enough.

128
00:09:00,152 --> 00:09:02,940
"Dick!" (on the wall)

129
00:09:07,099 --> 00:09:08,466
"Shit!" (on the wall)

130
00:09:12,967 --> 00:09:13,890
"Smelly Cunt!" (on the door)

131
00:09:25,141 --> 00:09:28,189
Hello... anybody there?

132
00:09:36,383 --> 00:09:37,458
Oh, no...

133
00:09:50,259 --> 00:09:51,387
Hey, what's up Terkel

134
00:09:51,687 --> 00:09:54,222
Please don't...
Have you pissed in your pants?

135
00:09:54,464 --> 00:09:57,162
Haha, you've pissed in your pants
Haha, funny...

136
00:09:57,591 --> 00:09:58,520
Come on Sten...

137
00:10:00,540 --> 00:10:04,743
Hey Terkel listen, if this was an army
gun we would've shot your balls off

138
00:10:05,061 --> 00:10:07,242
In Vietnam...
Look Sten! That's chubby Dorit

139
00:10:07,511 --> 00:10:08,493
Get her!

140
00:10:08,890 --> 00:10:11,820
If you get her bag then I'll pull her hair
Deal!

141
00:10:12,493 --> 00:10:14,879
Fat Dorrit, you're so fucking nasty...

142
00:10:21,913 --> 00:10:25,439
It was the end of the schoolday and the
final subject of the day was "Danish"

143
00:10:25,582 --> 00:10:29,554
But instead of their ordinary teacher
Yvonne a stranger arrived

144
00:10:30,189 --> 00:10:32,260
Look Jason, it's that weird guy

145
00:10:32,481 --> 00:10:36,113
Ah Gunnar, dude. Check that sweater,
really faggot looking

146
00:10:36,241 --> 00:10:40,536
Hey kids! Please sit down quietly
on your bottoms

147
00:10:42,580 --> 00:10:46,846
I'm Gunnar and err... do you
have any chalk?

148
00:10:47,282 --> 00:10:54,622
Excuse me Gunnar, I'm Silas and I would
like to volunteer to go get some chalk

149
00:10:54,748 --> 00:10:56,519
Well, thanks Silas

150
00:10:57,430 --> 00:11:00,497
As I said before, I'm Gunnar and I...
Here is the chalk!

151
00:11:00,775 --> 00:11:03,537
Wow
Ordinary and coloured chalk

152
00:11:03,616 --> 00:11:05,808
Great, listen up

153
00:11:05,861 --> 00:11:12,142
My name is Gunnar Bjerre and this
is my African opossum Liselotte

154
00:11:18,021 --> 00:11:24,270
Normally your teacher would be Yvonne
but unfortunately she had an accident

155
00:11:24,451 --> 00:11:27,360
Yvonne tripped all the way down the
stairs and...

156
00:11:27,868 --> 00:11:30,999
...rolled on to the big and dangerous
traffic filled road

157
00:11:31,207 --> 00:11:33,380
which you should never cross
without an adult

158
00:11:33,776 --> 00:11:37,884
Out on the road, the cars just didn't
have time to stop before it was too late

159
00:11:38,720 --> 00:11:43,143
Kids, Yvonne... she didn't make it

160
00:11:43,901 --> 00:11:45,481
She's not comming back ever again

161
00:11:53,107 --> 00:11:56,068
As I said, I'm Gunnar

162
00:11:56,367 --> 00:11:58,505
and I'm a newly appointed
substitute on this school

163
00:11:58,683 --> 00:12:02,728
Before this job I was a teacher at a "Rudolf
Steiner School". If you know what that is?

164
00:12:02,999 --> 00:12:05,361
It's a... yes Silas?

165
00:12:05,445 --> 00:12:07,101
I know what it is

166
00:12:07,429 --> 00:12:10,697
The children already knew about
these "Rudolf Steiner Schools"

167
00:12:10,906 --> 00:12:15,246
which in short terms are schools that
believe toys should be boring to play with

168
00:12:15,584 --> 00:12:18,608
Preferrably a stupid wooden
doll with no face

169
00:12:18,848 --> 00:12:21,229
That's something the kids have
to imagine for themselves

170
00:12:21,869 --> 00:12:23,505
I once had i grildfriend like this

171
00:12:24,484 --> 00:12:28,098
She wasn't made out of wood
though... unfortunately

172
00:12:28,523 --> 00:12:31,222
Anyways... back to the class

173
00:12:31,259 --> 00:12:33,472
Yes, thank you Silas for the
explanation

174
00:12:33,592 --> 00:12:36,713
Well kids, we better get to know
each other better

175
00:12:36,824 --> 00:12:40,026
I've brought along a peasack which
we can throw to each other

176
00:12:40,126 --> 00:12:41,473
while we state our names

177
00:12:41,550 --> 00:12:43,606
I can start, I'm Gunnar

178
00:12:45,062 --> 00:12:48,603
and err.. how about we just take
the rest of the day off?

179
00:12:51,029 --> 00:12:51,439
Cool!

180
00:12:53,927 --> 00:12:56,741
Won't you be our big brother Gunnar?
What?

181
00:12:56,990 --> 00:13:00,572
You can be our big brother because
you have such a nice necklace

182
00:13:01,792 --> 00:13:03,930
Totally cute rat
Opossum!

183
00:13:04,130 --> 00:13:04,975
Yeah, I knew that

184
00:13:05,053 --> 00:13:07,281
Gunnar can we put make-up on
you just like on a girl?

185
00:13:07,442 --> 00:13:10,249
No girls, you must be
missing a few screws

186
00:13:12,104 --> 00:13:15,293
See you tomorrow girls
Bye bye big brother

187
00:13:17,499 --> 00:13:19,851
"Win a new wife - Lottery" (on the sign)

188
00:13:26,771 --> 00:13:27,521
Oh no!

189
00:13:29,366 --> 00:13:30,449
Terkel...?

190
00:13:30,903 --> 00:13:32,081
What?

191
00:13:32,108 --> 00:13:34,694
Can you walk me home, Terkel?

192
00:13:34,972 --> 00:13:36,502
God dammit, you can walk
home yourself!

193
00:13:36,619 --> 00:13:38,065
It's because I forgot my key

194
00:13:38,565 --> 00:13:40,201
Then use the spare key!

195
00:13:40,576 --> 00:13:42,285
But I can't remember where it is

196
00:13:43,364 --> 00:13:45,977
In the shed under the flowerpots!

197
00:13:46,240 --> 00:13:51,549
But Terkel it's just that...
Leave us be, ghees!

198
00:13:51,605 --> 00:13:53,680
Are we crashing your place Terkel?

199
00:13:53,929 --> 00:13:57,426
No we can't today... My parents
are planning the wedding

200
00:13:58,047 --> 00:14:01,644
the whole house is filled
with marzipan etc.

201
00:14:02,709 --> 00:14:05,587
Terkel's parent were to be
married the comming saturday

202
00:14:06,359 --> 00:14:07,121
Hey boys

203
00:14:08,065 --> 00:14:09,210
Hey Gunnar

204
00:14:09,212 --> 00:14:12,604
Are you out buying sweets?
Yeah, we've bought sniffsticks

205
00:14:13,173 --> 00:14:15,491
Well, see you on Monday, bye

206
00:14:16,041 --> 00:14:17,801
Yeah
Whatever...

207
00:14:24,424 --> 00:14:28,673
Can't we be at your place today?
Today ain't really a good day...

208
00:14:28,709 --> 00:14:30,645
Why?
Yeah, that's why!

209
00:14:32,592 --> 00:14:35,841
But Jason we're never at your place
No...

210
00:14:35,943 --> 00:14:40,336
I haven't even seen how you live
Listen, I just can't cope with it today

211
00:14:40,802 --> 00:14:42,959
I'm totally wasted
Crap!

212
00:14:43,048 --> 00:14:45,360
Why do you always that stick
in your pocket?

213
00:14:45,385 --> 00:14:49,652
Don't shit me, you never know when
an iron pipe can come in handy

214
00:15:00,830 --> 00:15:03,002
I'm home...
No

215
00:15:03,317 --> 00:15:05,133
Hello dad
No!

216
00:15:05,360 --> 00:15:07,887
Err, have you had a good day?
No...

217
00:15:09,134 --> 00:15:11,654
Ready for the wedding tomorrow?
err... no!

218
00:15:12,149 --> 00:15:14,783
You'll probably get ready in time
No

219
00:15:14,843 --> 00:15:16,350
Is mom home?
No

220
00:15:17,868 --> 00:15:18,834
No!

221
00:15:18,980 --> 00:15:20,785
I'm out here in the kitchen, Terkel

222
00:15:27,314 --> 00:15:30,999
Hello dear
Had a good day?

223
00:15:31,406 --> 00:15:33,324
Yes, we've got a new teacher

224
00:15:34,399 --> 00:15:38,682
Miss Yvonne is dead
Terkel please wipe this

225
00:15:40,752 --> 00:15:42,251
Sounds like you had great fun, eh?

226
00:15:43,680 --> 00:15:46,225
Mom, can I go to the ramp
after we've had dinner?

227
00:15:46,459 --> 00:15:51,210
No Terkel, not tonight. All of us
have to get up early in the morning

228
00:15:51,256 --> 00:15:52,765
What if I come home early?

229
00:15:53,062 --> 00:15:56,382
Terkel, we're having a big party tomorrow
and it's important that you get your sleep

230
00:15:56,650 --> 00:15:58,968
If you don't get 8 hours of sleep
you could end up getting anthrax

231
00:15:59,023 --> 00:16:02,301
and shrink to the size of a matchbox
Err mom...

232
00:16:02,667 --> 00:16:04,461
That wouldn't be the first time
something like that happened

233
00:16:49,814 --> 00:16:51,586
Hey Terkel, open the window, dude

234
00:16:52,823 --> 00:16:55,248
Jason what in the name of the
lord are you doing here?

235
00:16:55,566 --> 00:16:57,842
"What in the name of the lord are you doing?"
Try speaking a language I can understand

236
00:16:57,924 --> 00:17:01,240
It's 2am
So? Don't be a crybaby

237
00:17:01,788 --> 00:17:03,644
Wake up, we have a flick to watch!

238
00:17:15,000 --> 00:17:21,441
Terkel wasn't really into horror movies but
you can't really say that to your best friend

239
00:17:21,893 --> 00:17:25,507
So instead he said: Wow man, got
his arm chopped off...

240
00:17:25,680 --> 00:17:26,335
Yeah, shut up

241
00:17:27,707 --> 00:17:30,822
...and the head!
Haha, eat shit and die!

242
00:17:41,002 --> 00:17:45,879
I therefore ask you
Vera Gungadin Mogensen

243
00:17:45,917 --> 00:17:50,661
will you take Beate Happerkuk Stenstrøm
to be your lawfully wedded wife?

244
00:17:52,052 --> 00:17:52,783
No!

245
00:17:54,919 --> 00:17:57,512
Here they come...
Congratulations!

246
00:17:59,811 --> 00:18:02,368
Come on Rita, you have to
throw rice at mom and dad

247
00:18:02,568 --> 00:18:03,962
No that's not nice

248
00:18:04,099 --> 00:18:06,933
That's the way it's done Rita
That way they can get fertile

249
00:18:07,119 --> 00:18:08,169
Fertile?

250
00:18:08,535 --> 00:18:12,863
Yes, so they can have kids and stuff
But they have us Terkel?

251
00:18:13,162 --> 00:18:15,183
Yes, but you'd like a
little brother, right?

252
00:18:16,459 --> 00:18:18,161
Ouch honey! Don't throw that hard

253
00:18:18,731 --> 00:18:21,270
Ouch Rita! Not that kind of throw,
you can end up deaf from those

254
00:18:31,402 --> 00:18:36,082
So grandmother, I don't see you eating
anything? Can't chew it? A spin in the blender?

255
00:18:36,411 --> 00:18:42,729
You can also get a toast. Do you want a toast?
With cheese and ham. It's hard getting old, eh?

256
00:18:54,937 --> 00:18:58,750
Well they've asked me NOT to give any
speeches... Yeah!

257
00:18:59,611 --> 00:19:03,898
...Particularly because of the situation
at the last family reunion

258
00:19:04,204 --> 00:19:08,186
But what the hell, it's not everyday
that your little niece gets married

259
00:19:09,843 --> 00:19:14,830
Terkel! Your mom has a formidable ass!
Haha, just joking

260
00:19:15,388 --> 00:19:16,802
You'll get over it...
No.

261
00:19:16,807 --> 00:19:18,612
Take it easy, I'll buy you a whore later

262
00:19:18,606 --> 00:19:22,043
Sit your ass down Leon! I don't want
to punch you on your wedding day.

263
00:19:22,113 --> 00:19:22,647
No

264
00:19:23,330 --> 00:19:26,493
And then I think we should make a
toast to the bride and groom

265
00:19:26,860 --> 00:19:32,479
...or at least say, "Yes sir!"
Cheers!

266
00:19:33,227 --> 00:19:36,267
And you don't get off without a song
Fireman, hit it!

267
00:19:37,694 --> 00:19:40,149
Now just listen to me
Everybody sit down

268
00:19:41,703 --> 00:19:46,200
"Beate and Leon today we party"

269
00:19:47,022 --> 00:19:50,417
"Because you're going to
be spliced tomorrow"

270
00:19:50,862 --> 00:19:54,644
Actually it's today but I wrote
this shit last night

271
00:19:55,170 --> 00:19:57,639
"It's lovely to be..."

272
00:20:00,054 --> 00:20:04,200
What's up Terkel?
Just someone from my class, I'll be right back

273
00:20:04,277 --> 00:20:06,440
I want to go with you
No Rita stay here

274
00:20:11,884 --> 00:20:14,300
Sten? Saki?

275
00:20:18,932 --> 00:20:19,479
Sten...?

276
00:20:22,374 --> 00:20:23,199
Saki...?

277
00:20:25,491 --> 00:20:28,095
Take it easy man
Damn you look frightened

278
00:20:28,134 --> 00:20:30,063
It's just us
I knew that

279
00:20:30,092 --> 00:20:31,282
Wanna get shot?

280
00:20:32,080 --> 00:20:32,361
Hehe, no

281
00:20:33,774 --> 00:20:35,641
What's up Terkel?
What's happening?

282
00:20:36,092 --> 00:20:38,391
Not really anything
Having a party?

283
00:20:38,945 --> 00:20:40,811
Just my parents, who got married

284
00:20:41,639 --> 00:20:42,764
What are you guys doing?

285
00:20:42,822 --> 00:20:44,640
We're going to get battered.
Show it to him, Sten

286
00:20:45,448 --> 00:20:48,162
It's "extra dry"
Okay...

287
00:20:48,450 --> 00:20:52,204
He stole it from his dad
No, he said that i could take it

288
00:20:52,243 --> 00:20:54,322
Yeah, sure he did, smartass

289
00:20:54,502 --> 00:20:56,269
Can we get anything to drink
from the party?

290
00:20:57,005 --> 00:21:00,018
Nah, don't think so
Can't you get a beer for us?

291
00:21:00,258 --> 00:21:02,261
No, that's not a good idea

292
00:21:03,044 --> 00:21:05,312
Err, it won't be a big one then

293
00:21:06,083 --> 00:21:10,992
Maybe I can get 1 ... or 2,3 beers

294
00:21:12,330 --> 00:21:14,559
I think there's a whole crate of
beers out in the back

295
00:21:14,588 --> 00:21:18,191
"...brawn and figs and roasted herrings in pickle"

296
00:21:18,682 --> 00:21:23,629
"And bread and buuuutter..."

297
00:21:23,627 --> 00:21:27,326
Err, Stewart what about toast?
Sit your ass down or I'll fuck you up!

298
00:21:27,831 --> 00:21:32,480
"At last I will lift my glass..."

299
00:21:33,491 --> 00:21:37,606
"...And say congratulations"

300
00:21:38,050 --> 00:21:42,033
"And then I will sit down on my seat"

301
00:21:43,170 --> 00:21:47,182
"And put a fillet of fish in my mouth"

302
00:21:47,343 --> 00:21:56,161
"And liver pâté and chicken and turkey"
"And ham and roast pork"

303
00:21:56,491 --> 00:21:57,210
"And..."

304
00:22:00,458 --> 00:22:04,470
What the hell?! Are you trying to steal
the adults' lemonade? You little bastard!

305
00:22:04,788 --> 00:22:07,045
It was Sten and Saki who made me do it

306
00:22:07,046 --> 00:22:11,606
What?! Are you talking shit to your uncle?
It's true!

307
00:22:11,623 --> 00:22:14,603
They're outside, and they had guns and stuff

308
00:22:14,912 --> 00:22:17,206
No uncle Stewart don't do it!

309
00:22:17,735 --> 00:22:18,604
What the hell!

310
00:22:19,042 --> 00:22:21,578
Surprise filthy little swines
Who the hell is he?

311
00:22:21,737 --> 00:22:22,910
It's my uncle

312
00:22:23,089 --> 00:22:27,671
So, you're trying to steal from old uncle Stewart?
What the fuck are you talking about?

313
00:22:27,731 --> 00:22:31,345
Little Terkel here has just told
me how you wall-eyed sons-of-bitches...

314
00:22:31,484 --> 00:22:34,748
...have made him steal beer from me
That's a lie!

315
00:22:36,007 --> 00:22:38,841
What the fuck?
So you're calling me a liar?

316
00:22:39,129 --> 00:22:42,127
Fuck, you can't just hit him!
So you want some with the ring too?

317
00:22:43,520 --> 00:22:45,811
Don't be impudent Sonny-boy
or I'll make you eat dirt

318
00:22:46,091 --> 00:22:49,293
But he's much smaller than you!
What are you going to do about it, crybaby?

319
00:22:49,540 --> 00:22:51,262
Take that!

320
00:22:53,773 --> 00:22:55,021
Don't stand on his head!

321
00:22:58,676 --> 00:22:59,660
Quick action

322
00:23:00,902 --> 00:23:03,288
And stay out fuck-faces!

323
00:23:03,305 --> 00:23:06,113
What are you doing uncle Stewart?
Who me?

324
00:23:06,361 --> 00:23:08,816
I'm the one who'll get all the
trouble on monday

325
00:23:09,252 --> 00:23:13,382
Don't take it so hard kid
Come, let's go in and beat up your dad

326
00:23:29,058 --> 00:23:35,630
No I don't want to be your fucking boyfriend
Get it, you ugly sack of slime

327
00:23:41,128 --> 00:23:43,833
Ouch, damn that shit!
Hey Jason

328
00:23:44,694 --> 00:23:48,139
Hey Terkel
Did you just hear that?! Boyfriend?!

329
00:23:48,445 --> 00:23:51,025
If she said that she wanted
to be my bitch or ho...

330
00:23:51,975 --> 00:23:54,810
She talks so fucked up that
it gets on my nerves

331
00:23:56,317 --> 00:23:58,737
Why are you only turning up now?

332
00:23:59,568 --> 00:24:02,613
It's just because...
Hey what's wrong with Sten and Saki?

333
00:24:03,030 --> 00:24:06,602
What do you mean?
Fair enough, they just seem pretty pissed at you

334
00:24:06,900 --> 00:24:09,345
They're in the class talking about
how big a jerk you are

335
00:24:09,545 --> 00:24:10,684
I knew it...

336
00:24:10,963 --> 00:24:11,831
Knew what?

337
00:24:11,965 --> 00:24:15,525
And then Terkel told everything
that happened Saturday night

338
00:24:15,606 --> 00:24:21,229
Haha, get the fuck out of here. Awesome
I would've liked to see that

339
00:24:21,297 --> 00:24:24,359
Funny haha. I'm the one who will
get all the trouble

340
00:24:27,417 --> 00:24:28,920
Do you think it's that bad?

341
00:24:30,128 --> 00:24:35,520
I got i message from the Gorilla Club
which I'm a member... hey boys!

342
00:24:35,622 --> 00:24:36,407
What's up!

343
00:24:43,145 --> 00:24:47,064
My mom has written in my
contact-book why I was late

344
00:24:47,132 --> 00:24:48,960
Yes? Let's see...

345
00:24:50,177 --> 00:24:54,043
"Terkel has got milk allergies
so he was allowed to sleep late...

346
00:24:54,373 --> 00:24:57,960
...There's no reason for the kid
getting cirrhosis of the liver...

347
00:24:58,182 --> 00:25:00,028
...Yours faithfully, Beate"

348
00:25:00,845 --> 00:25:06,942
Yes... you're allowed to sit down

349
00:25:07,699 --> 00:25:10,461
Damn informer pig!
Damn army whore!

350
00:25:12,092 --> 00:25:14,285
"You are doomed Terkel!!"

351
00:25:15,094 --> 00:25:18,487
Well as I said before, I've received a
message from the Gorilla Club

352
00:25:18,824 --> 00:25:26,933
They wrote that the piebald
salamander was seen 3 days ago...

353
00:25:27,428 --> 00:25:32,465
...just out in the Degne moor.
So I have arranged a camping trip

354
00:25:35,400 --> 00:25:39,182
Easy now... that's it

355
00:25:39,540 --> 00:25:44,641
We're leaving Wednesday morning so
I need your mom or dad's signature...

356
00:25:44,895 --> 00:25:47,130
...stating that it's okay that
you sleep out at the moor

357
00:25:47,330 --> 00:25:49,292
Excuse me Gunnar?! Yes... Silas?

358
00:25:49,550 --> 00:25:57,669
What's the difference between a piebald
salamander and an ordinary salamander?

359
00:26:03,549 --> 00:26:10,387
Fucking nasty rotten crap shit project!
Sour herb and bad gift, man!

360
00:26:10,424 --> 00:26:12,585
Jason it could be fun.

361
00:26:12,677 --> 00:26:17,463
Yeah jumping around in some plague infested
moor, trying to catch some shitty salamanders?!

362
00:26:17,622 --> 00:26:22,313
But we're going to sleep in a tent, the 2 of
us togehter, that's going to be fun

363
00:26:22,421 --> 00:26:25,171
It's just that... argh that crap pipe!

364
00:26:25,464 --> 00:26:30,139
Throw that damn pipe out Jason.
Are you crazy? Don't wanna discuss it

365
00:26:30,535 --> 00:26:33,096
You never know when you need an iron pipe

366
00:26:37,760 --> 00:26:39,984
Think it's gonna be great

367
00:26:40,371 --> 00:26:44,323
You think so sissy-boy?
Looking forward to catch salamanders?

368
00:26:44,350 --> 00:26:46,659
Are you cruel toward animals?
Haha, cruel towards animals

369
00:26:46,977 --> 00:26:48,632
What?! Cruel towards animals?!

370
00:26:48,720 --> 00:26:55,202
Yeah, you don't have to repeat or are you a mimic?
Yeah, you don't have to repeat... or are you a mimic... err

371
00:26:55,461 --> 00:26:57,987
Whimp! Animal tormentor! Mimic!

372
00:26:58,024 --> 00:26:59,347
Leave me alone!

373
00:27:02,285 --> 00:27:04,651
"I love G____R" (on the blackboard)
Then we said that you were a member...

374
00:27:04,890 --> 00:27:07,411
...of our club, right big brother?
Yeah, and then you have to write letters

375
00:27:07,570 --> 00:27:08,762
Yeah, because we're pen pals

376
00:27:08,991 --> 00:27:11,984
Would you be my pen pal?
And can we cut your hair?

377
00:27:12,233 --> 00:27:14,937
Ghees, you're completely nuts

378
00:27:15,430 --> 00:27:17,570
Gunnar, can I have a word with you?

379
00:27:19,161 --> 00:27:22,386
Of course Terkel
Let go of me girls...

380
00:27:23,751 --> 00:27:25,478
This way Terkel

381
00:27:27,251 --> 00:27:31,020
...it's just Sten and Saki, they won't stop teasing me
Are they teasing you?!

382
00:27:31,145 --> 00:27:38,269
Yeah, they call me a sissy, animal tormentor and a mimic
I think that sounds awful, Terkel

383
00:27:38,308 --> 00:27:41,200
Actually I think that you should strike back
But how?

384
00:27:41,732 --> 00:27:45,705
Which of them is the boss?
Sten, I think...

385
00:27:45,882 --> 00:27:50,148
Then I think you should confront Sten
One should always go after the boss,

386
00:27:50,506 --> 00:27:52,361
then the others will automatically
get out of your way

387
00:27:53,015 --> 00:27:56,729
I think that you should go over to
Sten and say: Hey dude, what about yourself?

388
00:27:56,928 --> 00:27:58,236
"What about yourself?"...

389
00:27:59,002 --> 00:28:03,520
"What about yourself?"!
Then they'll see how wrong they've been

390
00:28:04,280 --> 00:28:05,373
Okay, thanks Gunnar

391
00:28:19,025 --> 00:28:20,986
Look, here comes the animal tormentor

392
00:28:21,539 --> 00:28:23,094
And what about yourself?

393
00:28:23,984 --> 00:28:24,830
Huh?

394
00:28:25,022 --> 00:28:26,867
Yeah Sten, what about yourself?

395
00:28:26,935 --> 00:28:29,106
What the hell is he babbling about?
Yeah, what do you mean?

396
00:28:29,404 --> 00:28:32,043
I say, "What about yourself?"!

397
00:28:37,329 --> 00:28:38,612
"What about yourself" (gold letters)

398
00:28:46,657 --> 00:28:49,041
"What about yourself?!"
"You're just a loser"

399
00:28:49,249 --> 00:28:52,043
"You call me a cruelty, sissy and a mimic"

400
00:28:52,401 --> 00:28:56,941
"You're a goof and totaly disgusting"
"Come on! Are you a wuzz?"

401
00:28:57,014 --> 00:29:02,566
"You long sock!"
"'Cause your pants flutters when I'm beating you"

402
00:29:02,944 --> 00:29:04,264
"A shoe right in the ass"

403
00:29:04,671 --> 00:29:07,494
"I'll kick your mom in her cunt"
"screaming everybody get the fuck out"

404
00:29:07,901 --> 00:29:10,178
"You can step on the one ones lying on the ground"
"And those who whisper are lying"

405
00:29:10,348 --> 00:29:11,436
"Unless they whisper that I'm cool!"

406
00:29:11,726 --> 00:29:15,056
"My mouth will not be silent"
"Dickheads better watchout"

407
00:29:15,356 --> 00:29:17,462
"If there's more trouble with you"
"I'll squeal on you"

408
00:29:18,037 --> 00:29:19,483
"'Cause what you say is what you are"

409
00:29:19,842 --> 00:29:22,763
"It's in the news"
"That you're a toffee"

410
00:29:23,161 --> 00:29:25,391
"You're it, punkass"
"Give me five!"

411
00:29:25,700 --> 00:29:27,748
"Fat Fart"
"and you can't sing it back"

412
00:29:28,200 --> 00:29:29,818
"'Cause what you say is what you are"

413
00:29:30,082 --> 00:29:33,144
"It's in the news"
"That you're a toffee"

414
00:29:33,352 --> 00:29:35,536
"You're it, punkass"
"Give me five!"

415
00:29:35,880 --> 00:29:37,751
"Fat Fart"
"and you can't sing it back"

416
00:29:37,902 --> 00:29:38,854
"What about yourself?!"

417
00:29:39,125 --> 00:29:41,536
"Yeah I got it"
"Your mother humps everything"

418
00:29:41,557 --> 00:29:45,519
"And your daddy consists of 10 different men"
"And my dad can kick everyone of their asses"

419
00:29:45,653 --> 00:29:48,341
"And if you think you found a save spot"
"You better run home to momma"

420
00:29:48,526 --> 00:29:50,063
"You act like a mirror when I'm fucking with ya"

421
00:29:50,321 --> 00:29:53,678
"But I'm hooked on slapping you with 10 mirrors"
"with your ugly face on"

422
00:29:53,729 --> 00:29:55,532
"I got you 1... 2... 3... times"

423
00:29:55,661 --> 00:29:57,277
"You're a dickhead motherfucker"

424
00:29:57,425 --> 00:29:58,630
"And a square asshole"

425
00:29:58,805 --> 00:30:01,129
"You're the one who started this"
"But I'm the one who finishes it"

426
00:30:01,309 --> 00:30:03,879
"I'll throw around like the pussy you are"

427
00:30:04,043 --> 00:30:08,923
"You picked the fight, but got screwed over"
"But from this point on, you'll shut your fucking face"

428
00:30:08,984 --> 00:30:09,429
"And if not... "

429
00:30:09,471 --> 00:30:14,247
"I'm going to motherfucking tell the grown ups"
"Biatch"

430
00:30:20,646 --> 00:30:21,486
Sissy boy!

431
00:30:21,804 --> 00:30:25,283
Yeah, totally a sissy.. and a mimic

432
00:30:31,210 --> 00:30:36,946
It probably won't come as a surprise to you
that adults don't know what goes on in kids heads

433
00:30:37,343 --> 00:30:40,682
And least of all how to avoid getting bullied

434
00:30:43,517 --> 00:30:46,138
What's up crybaby? chickenshit?

435
00:30:47,690 --> 00:30:49,494
What the fuck is wrong with you?

436
00:30:50,364 --> 00:30:53,009
Nothing. I'm just tired.

437
00:30:55,747 --> 00:30:57,572
Terkel speaking.

438
00:30:57,620 --> 00:31:01,991
Terkel, you're not at the ramp again, are you?
But normally I'm allowed to..

439
00:31:02,102 --> 00:31:06,179
Listen here. It's gonna rain any sec now
and you know how wet tree spreads SARS

440
00:31:06,443 --> 00:31:11,261
We've allready talked about that
Ok, I'm coming home now.

441
00:31:11,383 --> 00:31:15,143
It's for your own sake.
We wouldn't want your knees to calque

442
00:31:15,252 --> 00:31:15,940
Huh?

443
00:31:45,110 --> 00:31:47,075
Did it hurt?
Hey sissyboy!

444
00:31:47,396 --> 00:31:49,942
We're going to kill you.
You little animal tormentor.

445
00:31:50,760 --> 00:31:52,421
Want a piece of my new gun?

446
00:31:52,880 --> 00:31:54,918
No please, I don't want to die

447
00:31:59,366 --> 00:32:02,649
We'll catch you.
You can't hide. We'll kill you.

448
00:33:34,642 --> 00:33:37,709
Welcome to the Hotline for Kids
Stewart speaking.

449
00:33:37,908 --> 00:33:42,574
Hey Stewart, it's Terkel
Hi Terkel. I'm working right now

450
00:33:42,843 --> 00:33:45,657
I know...
You have to call later...

451
00:33:46,299 --> 00:33:48,829
I have to be ready to take care
of the children's problems

452
00:33:49,040 --> 00:33:52,327
But I do have problems
Is that a fact.

453
00:33:52,506 --> 00:33:54,983
That's why I'm calling
Fair enough, go on sailor

454
00:33:55,172 --> 00:34:00,839
I'm getting bullied at school...
So, what's the problem?

455
00:34:01,059 --> 00:34:06,670
They say I'm an animal tormentor, a mime...
Yeah, I have to say that's not bloody original!

456
00:34:07,641 --> 00:34:10,681
What about super analdripping creep?
But..?

457
00:34:10,862 --> 00:34:17,984
Or eskimo drugwhore son-of-a-bitch?
Hey, here's a good one. Flabby gazelle cockhead

458
00:34:18,134 --> 00:34:23,030
Stewart..?
Gross bitch-of-a-nasty-fucking-leatherface

459
00:34:23,319 --> 00:34:28,522
But Stewart you have to help me!
Ofcourse my son, that's why I'm here

460
00:34:29,482 --> 00:34:31,761
Problems are here to be solved, you know

461
00:34:32,827 --> 00:34:35,641
Sometimes you just have to acknowledge
that you can't solve them yourself

462
00:34:36,305 --> 00:34:38,497
And never be afraid to cry out for help

463
00:34:38,761 --> 00:34:41,522
Now I'm going to tell you an
advice that my dad gave me

464
00:34:41,747 --> 00:34:45,457
"Ask for help"
"If you are in doubt"

465
00:34:45,901 --> 00:34:49,390
"Ask for help 'cause it's near"
"And it can save lives"

466
00:34:49,668 --> 00:34:53,167
"One can't manage all problems by oneself"

467
00:34:53,426 --> 00:34:57,093
"You can count on Stewart"
"Just ask for help"

468
00:34:57,431 --> 00:35:01,045
I have personally helped out
a few kids myself, listen:

469
00:35:01,320 --> 00:35:06,769
"Yesterday I met a boy who weeped"
"He couldn't find his way back home"

470
00:35:06,979 --> 00:35:08,697
"And he was afraid of the dark"

471
00:35:08,919 --> 00:35:12,330
"The kiddo said: dear Stewart can you help me?"

472
00:35:12,601 --> 00:35:16,330
"I took out my knife and yelled BOOH!"
"And suddenly he found his way home"

473
00:35:16,682 --> 00:35:20,175
"And then I remember Viktor "
"His dad really cruel"

474
00:35:20,375 --> 00:35:24,050
"He beat the kid yellow and blue"
"Whenever he had the time"

475
00:35:24,261 --> 00:35:27,832
"Victor called me up one day"
"and complained about his situation"

476
00:35:28,032 --> 00:35:31,655
"Unfortunately I was busy that day"
"So now Viktor is dead"

477
00:35:32,103 --> 00:35:35,405
"Ask for help if you need answers"

478
00:35:35,689 --> 00:35:37,536
"You can call night and day"

479
00:35:37,704 --> 00:35:39,424
"This captain is ready"

480
00:35:39,603 --> 00:35:43,001
"Push the 8 digits if you are feeling down"

481
00:35:43,361 --> 00:35:46,822
"And if I'm out drinking you can leave a message!"

482
00:35:48,499 --> 00:35:53,488
Can't I just get some help...?
That's right Terkel

483
00:35:53,648 --> 00:35:56,430
That's what you have to say,
if one day the shit hits the fan

484
00:35:56,580 --> 00:36:01,930
Take care and tell your dad that I'm popping
by to hand out some beatdown one of these days

485
00:36:29,651 --> 00:36:31,096
"Death to the animal tormentor"

486
00:36:33,213 --> 00:36:35,488
No!
Please I don't want to die!

487
00:36:36,283 --> 00:36:39,589
What is going on here?
Have you seen this mess, Leon?

488
00:36:40,776 --> 00:36:41,379
No

489
00:36:42,290 --> 00:36:43,788
What is it you're playing in here?

490
00:36:44,334 --> 00:36:48,621
A stone came through the window
It didn't just come through the window by itself.

491
00:36:48,897 --> 00:36:51,242
Maybe this will teach you not to
play with fire another time

492
00:36:57,081 --> 00:37:00,720
Terkel kept some distance to
Sten and Saki in the schoolyard

493
00:37:00,967 --> 00:37:08,097
If they were capable of throwning
bricks through a window

494
00:37:08,377 --> 00:37:10,652
Then who knew what they could be up to
Oh oh...!

495
00:37:11,192 --> 00:37:14,402
Hey look, there he is, the tormentor
Hey mime!

496
00:37:14,946 --> 00:37:15,981
A damn army whore

497
00:37:17,242 --> 00:37:21,588
Trying to hide, are you, huh?
Won't you just please leave me be?

498
00:37:21,842 --> 00:37:25,103
Now now there sissyboy, don't cry
You little animal tormentor

499
00:37:25,277 --> 00:37:28,160
Blinking your eyes, huh?
Afraid of your mom and dad?

500
00:37:40,071 --> 00:37:46,372
Terkel was wondering what to do,
when the class' fat girl Dorit came over

501
00:37:47,762 --> 00:37:52,319
You know what Terkel? Don't mind them.
They're just jealous

502
00:37:53,459 --> 00:37:56,752
Dorit?
Terkel had never talked to Dorit before

503
00:37:57,269 --> 00:38:00,439
He had actually never really noticed her
She was just a part of class

504
00:38:03,540 --> 00:38:04,422
What is it?

505
00:38:04,968 --> 00:38:08,481
It's just a letter,
but you don't have to read it now.

506
00:38:09,479 --> 00:38:14,774
Look! Chubby Dorit and the sissy are lovers
See, Terkel has cried

507
00:38:15,245 --> 00:38:18,332
Then it's good thing that he has
his girlfriend Chubby Dorit

508
00:38:18,357 --> 00:38:21,367
Yeah, they are lovers
And what if we are?!

509
00:38:21,416 --> 00:38:25,346
You're just damn jealous
Fat porky

510
00:38:25,802 --> 00:38:27,800
Hey Terkel, are you really in
love with Dorit?

511
00:38:28,184 --> 00:38:31,386
Terkel felt like talking back
and help Dorit

512
00:38:31,388 --> 00:38:33,200
just as she had tried to help him

513
00:38:33,205 --> 00:38:37,741
But instead Terkel did what one would
do with the back against the wall

514
00:38:38,351 --> 00:38:39,961
He passed the ball...

515
00:38:40,138 --> 00:38:44,415
Ermm, no I'm not in love with a
fat fucking cow like her

516
00:38:44,734 --> 00:38:49,229
That was all that was needed for Sten and Saki
to forget all about Terkel...

517
00:38:49,386 --> 00:38:51,281
...and jump all over the poor Dorit

518
00:38:51,414 --> 00:38:55,649
Haha, fat cow. Chubby whalefish.
Beached Whale, John Goodman

519
00:38:56,080 --> 00:38:59,247
Where are you going Chubby Dorit?
Stay here you fat cow

520
00:39:10,678 --> 00:39:14,756
Wow, that went pretty quick, huh?
Terkel was paralysed by horror

521
00:39:15,338 --> 00:39:22,773
Even though he could hear himself say:
Let's hope no one got hit by the fat cow

522
00:39:22,953 --> 00:39:27,441
Cool said Terkel
It looked really awesome

523
00:39:28,600 --> 00:39:29,666
Hurray for Terkel

524
00:39:34,911 --> 00:39:39,537
Imagine someone can bleed so much
That's obvious if you're a fat cow, right Terkel?

525
00:39:42,463 --> 00:39:44,683
Terkel? Wait a sec...

526
00:39:45,622 --> 00:39:48,000
Tell me, what really happened up in the class?

527
00:39:48,817 --> 00:39:53,628
Erhm, she jumped out of the window
Fair play, okay then...

528
00:39:54,786 --> 00:39:58,200
Luckily no one was hit by that fat cow

529
00:40:15,864 --> 00:40:16,743
The letter?!

530
00:40:23,157 --> 00:40:25,880
"Dear Terkel...
"I love you"

531
00:40:26,161 --> 00:40:28,542
"You're the only good thing in my life"

532
00:40:28,899 --> 00:40:32,860
"I get bullied everyday"
"And I can barely take it"

533
00:40:33,732 --> 00:40:39,629
"It's because of you that I'm still alive"
"Forever Yours, Dorit"

534
00:40:46,680 --> 00:40:47,846
One more sausage, Leon?

535
00:40:48,121 --> 00:40:49,192
No...
Yes you do

536
00:40:49,451 --> 00:40:51,520
No..!
That's the way it is!

537
00:40:52,685 --> 00:40:53,941
So Terkel...

538
00:40:55,987 --> 00:40:58,011
What have you been doing in school today?

539
00:40:59,406 --> 00:41:04,201
Today I got bullied so much that
I chose to bully Chubby Dorit

540
00:41:04,764 --> 00:41:08,526
Finally she got so upset that she jumped
out of the window from the 3rd floor

541
00:41:08,610 --> 00:41:12,782
Well, then you must've had your hands full.
Mom, she actually died!

542
00:41:12,810 --> 00:41:16,751
Rita, if you want the Toothfairy to come this year
then you surely don't want to chew so noisely

543
00:41:38,694 --> 00:41:41,334
Hi Terkel.
Stay out Rita

544
00:41:41,779 --> 00:41:45,413
Don't you want to play with my cut-out dolls?
I don't "play"!

545
00:41:46,527 --> 00:41:50,335
But you play with Jason?
We don't play, we're just together

546
00:41:50,570 --> 00:41:53,961
Don't you want to be together with
me and my dolls then?

547
00:41:54,047 --> 00:41:54,750
Keep out!

548
00:42:29,084 --> 00:42:30,967
"Psychopath on the loose" (Frontpage)

549
00:42:31,894 --> 00:42:34,115
Dad, I need to talk to you

550
00:42:34,665 --> 00:42:38,611
I have some problems in school and
there's no one who wants to help me

551
00:42:39,136 --> 00:42:44,361
So won't you please hear me out?
Noooo!

552
00:42:45,271 --> 00:42:46,569
Mom...?

553
00:42:49,023 --> 00:42:50,743
What is it Terkel?

554
00:42:56,423 --> 00:43:02,321
Want to play? Forever and ever?

555
00:43:03,820 --> 00:43:06,381
Nooooo
Come over here Terkel

556
00:43:06,901 --> 00:43:13,359
Where are you going?
Watch out that you don't rust Terkel

557
00:43:14,605 --> 00:43:16,788
"I'm comming, I'm comming"
"I'm comming to get ya"

558
00:43:16,960 --> 00:43:19,402
"I'm comming, I'm comming"
"I'm comming to touch you"

559
00:43:19,514 --> 00:43:21,538
"I'll shread what you think is safe"

560
00:43:24,228 --> 00:43:26,682
"I'm the shadow behind the curtain"
"I'm the branch on your window"

561
00:43:26,926 --> 00:43:29,202
"I'm a sound from your closet"
"I'm a voice inside your head"

562
00:43:29,399 --> 00:43:31,781
"I'm the tormented souls"
"The distorted cries"

563
00:43:31,912 --> 00:43:34,337
"From those in the computer
games that burned to death"

564
00:43:34,489 --> 00:43:36,985
"As your mom and dad who only
believe what they can see"

565
00:43:37,135 --> 00:43:39,506
"They say I don't exist.
What do they know?"

566
00:43:39,665 --> 00:43:42,070
"They are asleep when I haunt,
when I give you my thrill"

567
00:43:42,183 --> 00:43:44,490
"It's not them I'm visiting,
when I give you my scare"

568
00:43:44,604 --> 00:43:45,425
"I'm saying:"

569
00:43:45,576 --> 00:43:47,561
"I'm comming, I'm comming"
"I'm comming to get ya"

570
00:43:47,659 --> 00:43:50,030
"I'm comming, I'm comming"
"I'm comming to touch you"

571
00:43:50,180 --> 00:43:54,732
"I'll shread what you think is safe"
"Paranoia so loud it makes you go insane"

572
00:43:54,839 --> 00:43:55,332
"I'm saying:"

573
00:43:55,443 --> 00:43:58,017
"I'm comming, I'm comming"
"I'm comming to get ya"

574
00:43:58,095 --> 00:44:00,399
"I'm comming, I'm comming"
"I'm comming to touch you"

575
00:44:00,505 --> 00:44:02,686
"I'll shread what you think is safe"

576
00:44:30,983 --> 00:44:32,865
"You're a deadman Terkel"

577
00:44:37,083 --> 00:44:38,560
Who had wrote it?

578
00:44:39,084 --> 00:44:45,059
Was it Sten and Saki who had put salt
in his erm... bad conscience?

579
00:44:45,743 --> 00:44:47,261
It just had to be

580
00:44:51,148 --> 00:44:53,126
Terkel have you seen the spare key?

581
00:44:53,765 --> 00:44:56,589
What?
It's not in its usual place out in the shed

582
00:44:57,688 --> 00:45:00,606
I haven't seen it
Here, I've packed your suitcase

583
00:45:02,420 --> 00:45:05,879
Mom, are you throwing me out because
the extra key has gone missing?!

584
00:45:06,332 --> 00:45:08,590
Silly you, it's Wednesday

585
00:45:08,927 --> 00:45:12,240
What?
The Salamandertrip...

586
00:45:12,315 --> 00:45:13,818
Did you forget about that?

587
00:45:14,581 --> 00:45:19,899
Mom, can I please stay home?
Nonsense, you're going to sleep in tent with Jason

588
00:45:20,080 --> 00:45:22,967
out in the dark and dangerous forrest.
It's going to be fun

589
00:45:23,070 --> 00:45:26,414
I don't feel well.
That's probably just some hepatitis

590
00:45:26,460 --> 00:45:27,799
You just have to walk until it goes away

591
00:45:27,940 --> 00:45:30,016
Please let me stay at home?!

592
00:45:30,186 --> 00:45:32,947
Then you have to ask your dad first

593
00:45:35,023 --> 00:45:36,000
Dad...?

594
00:45:38,469 --> 00:45:39,577
No

595
00:45:46,735 --> 00:45:49,080
Sten we're taking the back seat
Definately

596
00:45:50,538 --> 00:45:52,510
Good morning Terkel
Good to see you

597
00:45:53,005 --> 00:45:56,875
Do you have a note from your parents?
Yes, here's my contactbook

598
00:45:57,719 --> 00:46:01,243
Would you be so sweet as to deliver all
your luggage to the busdriver over there?

599
00:46:07,090 --> 00:46:11,015
Is this some kind of joke Terkel?
If so I don't think it's funny

600
00:46:13,430 --> 00:46:16,003
"You're going to die!" (written)
You're going to die?

601
00:46:16,083 --> 00:46:19,640
Yeah, I can read it perfectly well myself.
But I don't think it's funny

602
00:46:21,315 --> 00:46:23,960
Ready to go kids
Terkel are you coming?

603
00:46:31,745 --> 00:46:34,575
Hey fuckface, come over here and sit
your ass down before I make you

604
00:46:35,270 --> 00:46:36,147
Hey Jason...

605
00:46:37,150 --> 00:46:38,880
Hey Terkel.
Cool bag

606
00:46:39,530 --> 00:46:42,426
Yeah totally cool bag
Is it army?

607
00:46:43,664 --> 00:46:49,488
Is it a bag from the army?
No, it's just an Eastpack

608
00:46:49,983 --> 00:46:52,050
Totally cool
Yeah

609
00:46:52,924 --> 00:46:55,832
What was it you called that Dorit?

610
00:46:58,275 --> 00:47:00,125
Fat cow?
Ah yes

611
00:47:00,400 --> 00:47:05,587
Fat cow, way cool
Terkel.. won't you sit next to me and Saki?

612
00:47:06,172 --> 00:47:08,818
Ermm, okay
cool

613
00:47:13,945 --> 00:47:15,381
What the fuck...

614
00:47:17,925 --> 00:47:20,923
Is anybody sitting here?
Actually someone is!

615
00:47:21,590 --> 00:47:23,282
I can't see anyone

616
00:47:23,335 --> 00:47:25,065
Well look closer then, you bum

617
00:47:25,361 --> 00:47:28,894
Bloody hell! Now I dropped my pipe
You bring bad luck

618
00:47:56,026 --> 00:47:57,820
Calm down for a sec?

619
00:47:58,053 --> 00:48:00,920
You silly little mischiefs
Okay Gunnar

620
00:48:01,027 --> 00:48:05,540
I feel like playing a song for you guys
If you would like to hear one?

621
00:48:06,763 --> 00:48:10,703
Oh dear, you're absolutely uncontrollable

622
00:48:10,909 --> 00:48:14,040
Hey Gunnar, can't you sing a song about
why we have to do so much homework?

623
00:48:14,426 --> 00:48:18,229
Listen up kids, you're all being spoiled

624
00:48:18,409 --> 00:48:21,338
There's actually a lot of children in
the world who are worse off than you.

625
00:48:21,617 --> 00:48:24,789
Nah, I don't believe that
Just pay attention:

626
00:48:25,936 --> 00:48:30,340
"Here's a story about a boy named Quang"

627
00:48:31,073 --> 00:48:33,192
"He's 7 years old and lives in Thailand"

628
00:48:33,530 --> 00:48:36,111
"And his workday is long"

629
00:48:36,231 --> 00:48:41,361
"He gets up early in the morning"
"And goes to bed very late"

630
00:48:42,040 --> 00:48:46,342
"'Cause Quang has a lot to do"
"Though he's just a boy"

631
00:48:49,049 --> 00:48:53,568
"Every morning at 4.45am"
"Quang takes off"

632
00:48:54,439 --> 00:48:59,264
"Through hawthorns and thistles"
"To a boat at the riverside"

633
00:48:59,661 --> 00:49:04,538
"The water is dark and cold"
"But the family ows money"

634
00:49:04,759 --> 00:49:09,539
"So he dives for pearls"
"But mostly without any luck"

635
00:49:10,981 --> 00:49:16,042
"So what the hell makes you think
that i want to listen to you grumble?"

636
00:49:16,748 --> 00:49:21,256
"That you don't like your spinach
and don't get enough allowance"

637
00:49:21,480 --> 00:49:26,184
"You have fast food and Nintendo"
"You have time to sillyness and play"

638
00:49:26,400 --> 00:49:32,122
"There's 1000 kids in the world
wanting to swap places with you"

639
00:49:33,528 --> 00:49:35,840
"Quang he's the oldest one"

640
00:49:35,977 --> 00:49:38,337
"Of a family of 10"

641
00:49:38,577 --> 00:49:43,431
"He's the one doing the cooking"
"When the day is over"

642
00:49:43,622 --> 00:49:49,082
"There are enough mouths to feed"
"Often it can be difficult"

643
00:49:49,253 --> 00:49:54,377
"So Quang has bought a tube of glue"
"That they can sniff for desert"

644
00:49:55,939 --> 00:50:00,731
"When Quang has put the small ones to bed"
"He is dead tired"

645
00:50:00,952 --> 00:50:05,891
"But he has to go to the village again"
"Eventhough it's night"

646
00:50:06,120 --> 00:50:11,070
"'Cause he has a date"
"that he arranged yesterday"

647
00:50:11,220 --> 00:50:17,056
"With his boyfriend Heinrich Schultze"
"Who is 45 years old"

648
00:50:19,578 --> 00:50:24,424
"So how the hell can you be telling me
that you life really sucks"

649
00:50:25,041 --> 00:50:29,200
"Would you please try and see it
in a larger perspective"

650
00:50:29,814 --> 00:50:34,290
"Think about others than yourself"
"Learn from my song"

651
00:50:34,460 --> 00:50:39,020
"Remember that you have a good life"
"if you don't live like Quang"

652
00:50:39,743 --> 00:50:46,229
"Remember that you have a good life"
"if you don't live like Quang"

653
00:50:48,640 --> 00:50:53,412
Gunnar, I just want to tell you that it's a real
shame about Quang ... I'm like, "what the fuck?"

654
00:50:53,652 --> 00:50:59,697
If it was oneself, one wouldn't think it very funny
And then I'm like "Hey stupid", we have to do something

655
00:51:00,588 --> 00:51:02,070
Yeah, and you can

656
00:51:02,241 --> 00:51:05,081
I have what you call a sponsorchild from
Vietnam whom I transfer money to

657
00:51:05,273 --> 00:51:07,139
It costs DKR 140 ($23) per month

658
00:51:07,400 --> 00:51:14,011
If you guys give me DKR 5 each you can all
help me support the little Philip Jongongong

659
00:51:14,880 --> 00:51:17,004
Is he called Philip Jongongong?

660
00:51:17,164 --> 00:51:21,001
Well Terkel it's a girl
But Philip is a boy's name?

661
00:51:21,162 --> 00:51:23,907
Yeah, but down there you can
be named whatever you like

662
00:51:44,043 --> 00:51:47,561
Yes, kids listen up!

663
00:51:47,921 --> 00:51:50,775
When you have raised your tents you
can go and explore the forrest

664
00:51:50,984 --> 00:51:54,419
You can also go down to the lake as long
as you keep a safe distance to the water

665
00:51:54,652 --> 00:51:56,577
And then we're going to bed early

666
00:51:57,291 --> 00:52:01,134
We have to go to bed at 10pm as we have to
get up at 5am to study the salamanders

667
00:52:02,905 --> 00:52:07,759
Yes Silas?
What if one would like to go to bed at 9.30pm?

668
00:52:07,833 --> 00:52:09,282
Shut your freaking ass Silas!

669
00:52:14,541 --> 00:52:16,586
Terkel was in a better mood

670
00:52:17,043 --> 00:52:19,399
Actually he had forgotten all
about the horrible messages

671
00:52:26,849 --> 00:52:27,579
Hi Jason

672
00:52:28,372 --> 00:52:30,607
What's up wannabe?
Take it easy...

673
00:52:30,726 --> 00:52:33,577
What's wrong with your head?!
They have been on your back for 2 days

674
00:52:33,737 --> 00:52:36,751
And then all of a sudden you're eating from
their palms. It makes no bloody sense

675
00:52:37,553 --> 00:52:40,650
They aren't bullying me anymore.
They're actually very nice

676
00:52:40,862 --> 00:52:43,347
Yeah, they're totally cool because they
aren't bullying you, right?

677
00:52:43,679 --> 00:52:45,563
That's why you're a brownnose, or?!

678
00:52:45,581 --> 00:52:49,000
Am not
Nonsense, fucking sellout!

679
00:52:49,100 --> 00:52:51,452
Come on...
I guess you're also sleeping in their tent?

680
00:52:51,721 --> 00:52:52,841
No...
Hey Terkel!

681
00:52:52,902 --> 00:52:55,000
Don't you want to sleep in
tent with me and Sten?

682
00:52:55,201 --> 00:52:56,267
What did I just say?

683
00:52:56,892 --> 00:52:58,620
Ermm, allright

684
00:53:00,805 --> 00:53:04,958
Is that okay Jason?
That's your fucking decision, loser

685
00:53:06,841 --> 00:53:08,244
Come on Terkel!

686
00:53:11,501 --> 00:53:13,804
Do you really think that we can
fit all 3 in that tent?

687
00:53:14,277 --> 00:53:18,360
Yeah sure, it's an army tent
Come on, you bought it at Macy's

688
00:53:18,602 --> 00:53:23,295
So what?! They probably also, erhm,
have Macy's in the army or...

689
00:53:23,416 --> 00:53:24,723
Take it easy, I know that

690
00:53:33,861 --> 00:53:38,883
Fucking false little fat shitty fucking...

691
00:53:48,167 --> 00:53:57,657
Yo Johanna. I just wanted to say
that I've been really mean to you

692
00:53:58,349 --> 00:54:08,200
I'm sorry... That's life, nobody
acts cool towards anyone anymore

693
00:54:09,648 --> 00:54:14,177
But I hope it's okay
Fuck off!

694
00:54:14,426 --> 00:54:17,333
'cause you're too ugly for me
and your mom's a skank ho

695
00:54:19,783 --> 00:54:21,658
What the fuck...?

696
00:54:22,199 --> 00:54:24,588
Jason had never experienced
Johanna that way

697
00:54:24,925 --> 00:54:27,719
What a temper. What use of language

698
00:54:28,381 --> 00:54:31,070
Imagine that a girl could talk that foul

699
00:54:32,285 --> 00:54:33,983
So unbelievable foul

700
00:54:39,416 --> 00:54:44,311
"How can one be so blind"
"I just didn't get it"

701
00:54:44,620 --> 00:54:47,970
"It's just now that really I see you"

702
00:54:49,604 --> 00:54:54,751
"'Cause you're a super hot fox"
"I've found the meaning with my life"

703
00:54:55,080 --> 00:54:58,862
"As a lightning from the sky,
what the hell is going on"

704
00:55:00,255 --> 00:55:05,164
"I haven't been able to see it before today"

705
00:55:06,015 --> 00:55:09,135
"that you suddenly looked at me and said:"

706
00:55:10,588 --> 00:55:11,892
"Fuck off!"

707
00:55:12,161 --> 00:55:16,626
"'Cause you're too ugly for me
and your mom's a skank ho"

708
00:55:16,800 --> 00:55:19,119
"You told me without a smile"

709
00:55:21,110 --> 00:55:23,241
"What do you want?"

710
00:55:23,450 --> 00:55:27,148
"I would do anything as long as you
say that you would be my girlfriend"

711
00:55:27,280 --> 00:55:29,644
"I love your style"

712
00:55:31,232 --> 00:55:36,782
"Damn girl you're so crazy"
"All that time I've wasted"

713
00:55:37,011 --> 00:55:40,934
"Before I understood that you're so hot"

714
00:55:42,186 --> 00:55:47,321
"And suddenly I'm standing here"
"Seeing how beautiful you are"

715
00:55:47,544 --> 00:55:51,021
"I'll feel down if you're not available"

716
00:55:53,216 --> 00:55:57,577
"I can only hope that you'll be my girl"

717
00:55:58,003 --> 00:56:02,911
"If you're motherfucking fresh with
that then let me hear you say:"

718
00:56:03,229 --> 00:56:04,749
"Fuck off!"

719
00:56:05,043 --> 00:56:09,084
"'Cause you're too ugly for me
and your mom's a skank ho"

720
00:56:09,242 --> 00:56:12,571
"You told me without a smile"

721
00:56:13,333 --> 00:56:15,494
"What do you want?"

722
00:56:15,684 --> 00:56:19,320
"I would do anything as long as you
say that you would be my girlfriend"

723
00:56:19,545 --> 00:56:21,920
"I love your style"

724
00:56:24,112 --> 00:56:25,904
"Fuck off!"

725
00:56:26,124 --> 00:56:29,761
"'Cause you're too ugly for me
and your mom's a skank ho"

726
00:56:29,985 --> 00:56:32,524
"You told me without a smile"

727
00:56:34,604 --> 00:56:36,445
"What do you want?"

728
00:56:36,585 --> 00:56:40,303
"I would do anything as long as you
say that you would be my girlfriend"

729
00:56:40,799 --> 00:56:43,540
"I love your style"

730
00:56:46,902 --> 00:56:49,841
Sten, what kind of sheet is that?
It's nothing!

731
00:56:50,691 --> 00:56:53,084
It's just that it looks like
something my baby sister...

732
00:56:53,293 --> 00:56:53,928
Well it's not!

733
00:56:54,226 --> 00:56:56,723
Sten!
What's up?

734
00:56:57,061 --> 00:56:59,707
It's just him Jason, he's gone mental

735
00:56:59,896 --> 00:57:01,509
What's up with Jason, Saki?

736
00:57:01,521 --> 00:57:04,495
I passed his tent and saw him
making out with Johanna

737
00:57:05,151 --> 00:57:10,814
I swear and then i went by and said "buhhhh",
I swear man it was just for giggles

738
00:57:10,925 --> 00:57:14,142
Then he freaked out
and slapped me in the face

739
00:57:14,145 --> 00:57:14,748
You're saying Jason hit you?

740
00:57:14,768 --> 00:57:17,935
Do you think I'm lying,
look I'm totally red on the cheek

741
00:57:18,096 --> 00:57:21,466
He's totally sick in his head
I bet it has something to do with his sister

742
00:57:22,141 --> 00:57:26,241
Sister?
Yeah, his sister is dead

743
00:57:26,444 --> 00:57:30,220
Hold on, does Jason have a sister?!
Yeah Dorit

744
00:57:30,608 --> 00:57:33,560
Chubby Dorit, the fat cow is his sister.
Or were.

745
00:57:33,688 --> 00:57:34,575
You didn't know?

746
00:57:36,144 --> 00:57:37,762
Dorit?
Yeah.

747
00:57:37,952 --> 00:57:41,659
Where did you guys hear this?
I went to kindergarten with him

748
00:57:41,843 --> 00:57:44,408
He just always pretended
not to know her in school

749
00:57:44,579 --> 00:57:45,531
It's true Terkel

750
00:57:46,631 --> 00:57:50,848
Terkel was speechless
Was Dorit really Jason's sister?

751
00:57:50,969 --> 00:57:56,109
And without Terkel knowing anything about it
Of course Terkel had never been home at Jason's

752
00:57:57,058 --> 00:58:00,293
It was as if Jason always
came up with an apology

753
00:58:01,105 --> 00:58:05,918
As if he didn't want Terkel to come
home and... find out

754
00:58:06,058 --> 00:58:10,492
...that HE was Dorit's brother!
Was it tied together that way?

755
00:58:10,607 --> 00:58:12,241
You really didn't know, Terkel?

756
00:58:12,807 --> 00:58:15,736
No
I thought that you were best friends?

757
00:58:22,447 --> 00:58:24,145
Sten can I borrow your...
Ahhh

758
00:58:24,403 --> 00:58:26,122
What's happening?
What is it?

759
00:58:26,283 --> 00:58:27,096
I don't know

760
00:58:27,319 --> 00:58:31,477
Take a look and see
Yeah, come on, it's your sleeping bag

761
00:58:34,440 --> 00:58:38,132
Holy fucking shit that is gross
Is it a cat or something?

762
00:58:38,211 --> 00:58:39,131
Where did it come from?

763
00:58:39,166 --> 00:58:40,123
It's HIM!

764
00:58:40,441 --> 00:58:41,256
Who!

765
00:58:41,337 --> 00:58:44,962
And then Terkel told about
all those creepy messages

766
00:58:45,237 --> 00:58:47,624
..and then in my contactbook it
said that he wanted to kill me

767
00:58:48,168 --> 00:58:50,920
you know, there isn't a lot of people
who know where that spare key lies

768
00:58:51,344 --> 00:58:53,684
Crazy shit
It's definately Jason

769
00:58:53,963 --> 00:58:56,632
I just don't understand it,
He's my best friend

770
00:58:56,887 --> 00:59:00,425
He's of course angry at you because
you made Dorit jump out the window

771
00:59:00,320 --> 00:59:03,160
Because I made...?
You guys were there too

772
00:59:03,300 --> 00:59:07,228
What if he's also planning to kill us, Sten?
I haven't recieved any threatening letters

773
00:59:07,405 --> 00:59:10,336
Me neither, and the dead cat
was only in your sleeping bag

774
00:59:11,307 --> 00:59:13,020
Yeah, that's true

775
00:59:17,201 --> 00:59:18,058
Terkel!

776
00:59:18,319 --> 00:59:20,025
Yes?!
Do you have some chewing gum?

777
00:59:22,653 --> 00:59:24,241
Thanks
Can I also get one?

778
00:59:25,907 --> 00:59:27,549
Did you hear that?
What?

779
00:59:28,156 --> 00:59:31,095
Probably just the wind
Night Terkel, night Terkel

780
00:59:31,609 --> 00:59:33,485
Yeah, goodnight

781
00:59:47,294 --> 00:59:49,110
What are you doing Terkel?

782
00:59:50,242 --> 00:59:53,176
What are you up to?
I've got an sms

783
00:59:53,193 --> 00:59:55,048
Who the fuck would message you this late?

784
00:59:55,240 --> 00:59:58,030
It's from Jason.
What does it say?

785
00:59:58,170 --> 01:00:03,098
It says that he will come and kill me now
Seriously?! Let me see

786
01:00:03,320 --> 01:00:06,624
Oh what the fuck!
You have to run over and tell it to Gunnar

787
01:00:06,701 --> 01:00:08,009
Yeah, you have to do that.

788
01:00:10,979 --> 01:00:12,266
Aren't you guys coming along?

789
01:00:12,447 --> 01:00:15,604
Erhm don't think it's a good idea...
right now

790
01:00:15,765 --> 01:00:17,569
We'll keep watch, Terkel

791
01:00:18,012 --> 01:00:19,000
Hurry up

792
01:00:21,129 --> 01:00:24,081
Take care of the flashlight, it's from the army

793
01:00:31,782 --> 01:00:32,776
Hey Terkel!

794
01:00:38,933 --> 01:00:40,572
Terkel stop!

795
01:00:42,465 --> 01:00:43,851
Terkel I swear...

796
01:00:52,936 --> 01:00:55,969
Gunnar, Gunnar, Gunnar!

797
01:00:56,212 --> 01:00:59,921
Terkel? What's this about?
You have to help me Gunnar

798
01:01:00,114 --> 01:01:02,769
It's Jason, he want's to kill me

799
01:01:03,009 --> 01:01:04,161
What?
It's true

800
01:01:05,160 --> 01:01:06,266
Nah
He's gone mental

801
01:01:06,494 --> 01:01:10,055
You have tell it to me from the beginning
Not here, We have to go

802
01:01:10,185 --> 01:01:12,105
Go? Where to?
He's just behind us

803
01:01:12,334 --> 01:01:15,695
Who's after us?
Can't we just go for a short walk? Just a short?

804
01:01:17,952 --> 01:01:22,579
I bullied Dorit so she jumped, but that was
because I didn't want to be bullied by Sten and Saki

805
01:01:22,887 --> 01:01:27,291
and then Dorit was Jason's sister
but I didn't know anything about that

806
01:01:46,261 --> 01:01:48,215
What's up fuckfaces? You can't sleep either?

807
01:01:48,602 --> 01:01:49,933
Jason!
Don't kill us!

808
01:01:50,210 --> 01:01:53,549
What the fuck are are you talking about?
Have you been eating mushrooms with Terkel?

809
01:01:54,282 --> 01:01:56,221
Mushrooms?
Did you kill Terkel?

810
01:01:56,530 --> 01:01:59,000
Get the fuck out of here, what
the fuck are you talking about?

811
01:01:59,096 --> 01:02:01,625
But you've sent him an sms saying
that you're coming to kill him

812
01:02:01,805 --> 01:02:04,807
Say what?!
It was your name on the display

813
01:02:05,195 --> 01:02:10,290
But... fuck I've lent my phone to...
God damn!

814
01:02:11,117 --> 01:02:15,817
Hey Jason, where're you going?
Hey Sten, why is your sleeping bag wet?

815
01:02:16,398 --> 01:02:19,760
...in the meantime I had recieved some scary
messages, and there's the dead cat

816
01:02:19,933 --> 01:02:26,209
and then Saki said that Jason hit him.
And he then sent an sms, Jason that is,

817
01:02:26,329 --> 01:02:30,426
that he wanted to kill me, Terkel that is
and now look at the display it says Jason

818
01:02:30,537 --> 01:02:32,149
"I'm coming to kill you"

819
01:02:33,799 --> 01:02:36,537
Woah Terkel, that was quite a swallow

820
01:02:37,002 --> 01:02:39,893
Yeah.
Know what? I'll give him a call

821
01:02:40,093 --> 01:02:43,054
I'm going to call him on this mobile
Then I'll tell him that I've told you

822
01:02:43,242 --> 01:02:47,941
And then he can't do anything
Terkel hang on just a moment

823
01:02:48,082 --> 01:02:50,044
No it has to be done now!
Terkel wait

824
01:02:50,160 --> 01:02:51,210
It's ringing...

825
01:03:01,041 --> 01:03:04,150
Terkel come to me.
Stay away

826
01:03:04,336 --> 01:03:07,641
Terkel you're confused.
Come to me.

827
01:03:08,140 --> 01:03:10,938
If I'm confused then how come
you've got a knife?

828
01:03:10,994 --> 01:03:14,465
We're just going to have some fun
I don't think it's funny

829
01:03:14,681 --> 01:03:19,489
Nah, but do you think the poor little spider
thought it funny when you sat down upon it...

830
01:03:19,684 --> 01:03:21,994
With your pretty jeans, eh?

831
01:03:24,233 --> 01:03:29,643
What?! That's what this is all about?
You thought you would go unpunished...

832
01:03:29,697 --> 01:03:33,366
from slaying a tiny animal?
You've planned this right from the start?

833
01:03:34,465 --> 01:03:36,032
Correctomundo

834
01:03:36,235 --> 01:03:41,042
Right from when you committed your crime,
I've done everything in my power to get revenge

835
01:03:41,311 --> 01:03:45,703
Unfortunately I had to push your teacher down
the stairs and drive over her a few times...

836
01:03:45,761 --> 01:03:48,144
...before I could become your teacher.
But that's life sometimes.

837
01:03:48,294 --> 01:03:50,573
Did you kill Yvonne?
Yes!

838
01:03:50,711 --> 01:03:54,377
Your insane!
Yes, but luckily I'm not an animal tormentor

839
01:03:55,031 --> 01:04:00,991
You can't just kill me because of a spider
No I won't JUST kill you

840
01:04:01,494 --> 01:04:05,921
I will cut you out in 8 equally large pieces
And burry the pieces all over the forrest

841
01:04:06,080 --> 01:04:10,086
so it can be absorbed by the earth and in that
way pay your debt to nature by manuring the earth

842
01:04:16,024 --> 01:04:17,164
You're not going anywhere Terkel!

843
01:04:35,365 --> 01:04:36,453
Come on...

844
01:04:41,588 --> 01:04:43,612
Mom...?
No!

845
01:04:43,970 --> 01:04:45,600
Oh, hey dad
No

846
01:04:45,893 --> 01:04:47,160
Dad you have to help me
No

847
01:04:47,388 --> 01:04:49,306
I'm out in the forrest
No

848
01:04:49,565 --> 01:04:51,350
Our new teacher is after me
No

849
01:04:51,500 --> 01:04:52,734
He has a knife
No

850
01:04:52,879 --> 01:04:54,730
But he wants to kill me
No!

851
01:04:55,215 --> 01:04:56,903
Dad give me mom
No

852
01:04:57,162 --> 01:04:58,428
Dad I'm serious
No

853
01:04:58,736 --> 01:05:02,023
Dad please!
No

854
01:05:02,222 --> 01:05:03,793
Give me the phone Leon
No

855
01:05:06,484 --> 01:05:09,211
Is that you Terkel?
No.. I mean yes!

856
01:05:09,404 --> 01:05:12,680
Why are you calling this late? Where are you?
I'm out in the forrest

857
01:05:12,789 --> 01:05:15,012
In the forrest? Then don't go further
out than to your belly button, ok?

858
01:05:15,142 --> 01:05:17,493
We don't want you to loose your feet
Mom I'm scared!

859
01:05:17,614 --> 01:05:21,840
Lucky you, then you're granted one wish. But you
can't say it aloud, otherwise your teeth'll fall out

860
01:05:22,042 --> 01:05:24,050
Bye now.
But mom!

861
01:05:24,182 --> 01:05:25,100
Bye bye

862
01:05:29,170 --> 01:05:30,440
Where are you Terkel?!

863
01:05:30,824 --> 01:05:34,481
You can't hide
I'll get you

864
01:05:35,246 --> 01:05:37,054
Animal tormentor!

865
01:06:19,437 --> 01:06:23,709
Uncle Stewart!
What the devil.. are you allowed out this late?

866
01:06:23,888 --> 01:06:27,218
We're camping with the class...
Yes yes, that's fine.

867
01:06:27,367 --> 01:06:31,285
I'm camping down at the pond due south
The problem is...

868
01:06:31,386 --> 01:06:35,746
Then I ran out of Vernerbranka. One can't
fish after eels without Vernerbranka

869
01:06:35,927 --> 01:06:39,437
You have to help me Stewart!
That's why I'm here sailor

870
01:06:39,644 --> 01:06:44,909
Can I ride with you into town?
Sorry, the milk box is in the way

871
01:06:45,100 --> 01:06:46,641
Can't you just take the milk box off?

872
01:06:46,869 --> 01:06:50,893
Are you utterly and completely mad?!
Then I can't transport my Vernerbranka

873
01:06:51,883 --> 01:06:55,322
Can't you drag the moped
'cause then we could go together...

874
01:06:55,361 --> 01:06:58,652
Nah, then the shop will close, chief
But my teacher wants to kill me

875
01:06:58,801 --> 01:07:03,522
Yeah, you have to remember to do your homework
Bye now, make sure there's wind in the sails

876
01:07:04,933 --> 01:07:08,747
"I cought an eel today but it needed
a drop of Vernerbranka..."

877
01:07:18,950 --> 01:07:22,251
Mom?
Do you miss your mom, huh?

878
01:07:22,691 --> 01:07:24,039
You fucked up little psycho

879
01:07:41,704 --> 01:07:44,999
I got you now you little bastard

880
01:07:49,241 --> 01:07:56,124
Not only do you kill small animals like a barbarian
You also pollute the forrest with your phone

881
01:07:56,541 --> 01:08:00,480
'Cause you don't care about everybody else
It's you it's all about, right Terkel?

882
01:08:00,569 --> 01:08:07,500
The whole world is your personal playground
But now it's over Terkel!

883
01:08:20,714 --> 01:08:25,164
Are you done you fucking asswipe?!
Jason!

884
01:08:25,827 --> 01:08:29,525
I told you Terkel, one never knows
when an iron pipe might come in handy

885
01:08:30,209 --> 01:08:33,411
You biffed him
That'll fucking teach him

886
01:08:33,936 --> 01:08:40,107
You saved my life, Jason
Hell yeah, you're buying the beer in the airport

887
01:08:40,323 --> 01:08:43,583
What?
That's just something my dad always say

888
01:08:46,117 --> 01:08:48,188
Look, you sat on an opossum

889
01:08:49,286 --> 01:08:53,804
No worries, it's just jeans.
I can wash them.

890
01:08:55,660 --> 01:09:00,097
And I who thought that...
Jason what about your sister?

891
01:09:00,684 --> 01:09:07,162
What about her?
Well, I made her jump out of the window?

892
01:09:07,296 --> 01:09:10,425
Fair enough, then I'm buying
the beers in the airport.

893
01:09:11,505 --> 01:09:14,144
What a crack.
Let's get out of this crappy wood.

894
01:09:17,707 --> 01:09:18,689
Jason!

895
01:09:20,015 --> 01:09:22,933
Here, catch this!
Grab it Terkel!

896
01:09:51,044 --> 01:09:53,074
Help me Terkel!

897
01:09:58,804 --> 01:10:01,172
Take the pipe God dammit.

898
01:10:07,224 --> 01:10:11,454
Take the iron pipe, idiot!
Terkel, now!

899
01:10:16,004 --> 01:10:20,860
Terkel, take the pipe Terkel
But...

900
01:10:22,412 --> 01:10:24,230
Little bastard...

901
01:10:28,561 --> 01:10:29,540
Freeze!

902
01:10:58,065 --> 01:11:00,841
Check that handle. He looks like a
fucking popsticle icecream

903
01:11:01,304 --> 01:11:04,150
Don't you want your pipe back?
Nah, it ain't that important.

904
01:11:09,604 --> 01:11:12,202
Sorry that I didn't kept
my part of the agreement

905
01:11:12,290 --> 01:11:15,521
I'll survive.
Now we're together again.

906
01:11:15,679 --> 01:11:17,124
Just the 2 of us

907
01:11:17,469 --> 01:11:20,671
Erhm. Actually we're 3 now
3?

908
01:11:22,944 --> 01:11:29,225
You know... Johanna
I guess that's fine by me

909
01:11:37,656 --> 01:11:39,626
Did you see the look on their faces?

910
01:11:41,181 --> 01:11:44,899
The morale of the story is of course that real
friends should err..

911
01:11:45,321 --> 01:11:50,602
have 20 minutes in the oven at 250 degrees Celcius
That's a bunch a nonsense

912
01:11:50,605 --> 01:11:56,787
Yes I've got it, if you bully someone then you'll
have to adjust to idea that you might get killed

913
01:11:56,871 --> 01:11:58,024
Nonsense again

914
01:11:58,269 --> 01:12:03,966
Erm.. if you have some friends then you'll
have to watch out that they do not get sick

915
01:12:04,241 --> 01:12:09,889
No, that not fucking it either.
Don't go, I have on my tip of my tongue

916
01:12:10,367 --> 01:12:16,033
You reep how you sail in a pond...
Wait err, I'll call you

917
01:12:16,933 --> 01:12:17,557
bye bye

918
01:12:25,302 --> 01:12:26,421
Action!

919
01:12:26,862 --> 01:12:30,791
I'm home
Yes.. or no no no I'm sorry

920
01:12:30,807 --> 01:12:31,925
Cut!

921
01:12:33,491 --> 01:12:34,141
Action!

922
01:12:34,647 --> 01:12:36,082
I'm home
Yes.. no dammit

923
01:12:37,722 --> 01:12:38,989
Sorry I can do it now

924
01:12:40,555 --> 01:12:41,248
Action!

925
01:12:41,639 --> 01:12:42,269
I'm home

926
01:12:43,996 --> 01:12:48,140
Err, Yes?
Dammit not again!

927
01:12:48,363 --> 01:12:50,366
I just have to check the manuscript

928
01:12:51,122 --> 01:12:53,084
Here Leon (sign: NO)

929
01:12:53,654 --> 01:12:54,510
Okay, I've got it now

930
01:12:55,260 --> 01:12:56,110
Action!

931
01:12:56,199 --> 01:12:57,693
I'm home

932
01:12:58,181 --> 01:13:01,142
Maybe
For fucks sake!

933
01:13:02,289 --> 01:13:04,506
If he can't learn a fucking word then kick him out!

934
01:13:06,302 --> 01:13:09,553
Leon you have to pull yourself together
For Terkel's sake

935
01:13:09,617 --> 01:13:11,810
Sorry Arne
Think you're ready Leon?

936
01:13:12,000 --> 01:13:13,256
No
That's good

937
01:13:18,185 --> 01:13:21,830
No no...

938
01:13:21,981 --> 01:13:23,723
Think you're ready Leon?

939
01:13:23,909 --> 01:13:25,765
Yes
Aaargh!

940
01:13:38,200 --> 01:13:43,107
And Cut. Excellent work everybody
Super realistic

941
01:13:43,692 --> 01:13:44,517
Fantastic

942
01:13:45,057 --> 01:13:48,532
We need a volunteer to dry up all the
theater blood and remove the doll?

943
01:13:48,850 --> 01:13:51,853
Then we'll take one more shot.
The doll is ready Arne.

944
01:13:52,542 --> 01:13:55,550
Err the doll?! But who is that then?

945
01:13:56,415 --> 01:14:01,261
Oh shit!
Ah no worries, it was just a fat cow

946
01:14:03,014 --> 01:14:08,090
Later on I starred in the film "National Lampoon's
Boring Vacation". My first really political engagement

947
01:14:08,479 --> 01:14:14,597
It was showed really minimalistic on Ko413.
I don't hope that this will be a commercial success...

948
01:14:14,733 --> 01:14:19,641
...that will rob me my political dignity,
and ruin my career in the long term

949
01:14:19,864 --> 01:14:27,151
Yeah, fuck that. That would be the most psycopathic
insane fucked up trip. A totally plague infested anus.

950
01:14:31,643 --> 01:14:36,025
You can't just hit him?!
Don't be impudent sailor or you'll be squashed

951
01:14:36,363 --> 01:14:38,186
You're insane?
That's it!

952
01:14:42,061 --> 01:14:44,126
Cut!
Take that you shitty brat!

953
01:14:44,390 --> 01:14:46,214
Cut!

954
01:14:46,662 --> 01:14:50,020
Stewart!
Let go of them

955
01:14:50,221 --> 01:14:52,894
What the fuck, do you wanna dance ballet you little fag

956
01:14:55,704 --> 01:14:57,747
Any security on the set?!

957
01:15:32,103 --> 01:15:34,211
Hey stop!

958
01:15:35,033 --> 01:15:35,510
Cut!

959
01:15:35,346 --> 01:15:37,211
Listen up.
What's up Terkel?

960
01:15:37,211 --> 01:15:41,087
I can't concentrate when somebody
is always making noise

961
01:15:41,247 --> 01:15:42,776
Who made the noise?
I'm sorry that was me.

962
01:15:42,897 --> 01:15:47,089
My leg felt asleep so I had to move the camera
How about I just go home?

963
01:15:48,603 --> 01:15:51,406
Get me a mineral water.
Yeah, mineral water for Terkel.

964
01:15:55,564 --> 01:15:56,762
Here you go Terkel

965
01:15:58,773 --> 01:16:00,240
No Rita not that plug

966
01:16:01,693 --> 01:16:05,255
Now listen Terkel, you're our star.
You are the movie.

967
01:16:05,780 --> 01:16:10,531
What the hell, this is with lemon. How
many times have I said that I hate lemon

968
01:16:11,109 --> 01:16:13,767
I don't wanna do this anymore. It's over!

969
01:16:14,522 --> 01:16:17,522
No!
Hurray there it was

970
01:16:17,647 --> 01:16:18,746
Okay now it's rolling

971
01:16:20,268 --> 01:16:22,218
"This movie is based on the radio program
'Arne Tells - Terkel in Trouble' by Anders Matthesen"

972
01:16:22,969 --> 01:16:25,929
Subtitles by Midas and Ghesus.

973
01:16:26,493 --> 01:16:31,529
Greets fly out to the ppl at Fileheaven.
And pretty much everyone else...
