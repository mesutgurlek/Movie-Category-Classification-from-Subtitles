3
00:02:29,196 --> 00:02:30,860
You almost have it, Kelly.

4
00:02:31,052 --> 00:02:33,037
Here. Let me show you.

5
00:02:51,199 --> 00:02:53,855
I'm never going to get all
these steps right, Barbie.

6
00:02:57,217 --> 00:02:59,902
If you keep practicing, you will.

7
00:03:03,423 --> 00:03:06,986
But what if I freeze out
there? In front of everybody?

8
00:03:07,543 --> 00:03:10,481
You've just got to
find the courage to try.

9
00:03:11,825 --> 00:03:15,426
- Like Clara!
- Clara? From the ballet?

10
00:03:15,579 --> 00:03:20,252
Uh-huh. You see, Clara lost her
parents when she was very young.

11
00:03:20,572 --> 00:03:25,173
She, and her little brother Tommy
were being raised by their Grandfather Drosselmayer.

12
00:03:25,225 --> 00:03:28,503
He loved them, but he was very stern.

13
00:03:38,794 --> 00:03:42,304
Candles! We need more candles!

14
00:03:47,841 --> 00:03:50,057
Clara, please, no more daydreaming.

15
00:03:50,078 --> 00:03:52,927
We have to finish decorating
before our guests arrive.

16
00:03:53,286 --> 00:03:55,411
Yes, Grandfather.

17
00:03:57,760 --> 00:04:01,741
22 minutes early. Such bad manners.

18
00:04:12,101 --> 00:04:14,118
It's beautiful, Miss!

19
00:04:14,555 --> 00:04:19,863
Mother gave this to me the
Christmas I saw my first ballet.

20
00:04:26,121 --> 00:04:31,847
Oh dear! The mice have found
their way into the Christmas boxes.

21
00:04:38,798 --> 00:04:42,034
You haven't seen Tommy, have you?

22
00:04:48,497 --> 00:04:49,749
Hey!

23
00:04:50,361 --> 00:04:52,777
Mystery solved.

24
00:04:56,598 --> 00:05:00,628
You might want to wash off that frosting
before the mice take a bite out of you.

25
00:05:00,739 --> 00:05:02,357
You can't tell me what to do!

26
00:05:02,517 --> 00:05:07,518
No. But I'm sure Grandfather
will insist on a bath.

27
00:05:14,522 --> 00:05:16,000
Clara!

28
00:05:17,592 --> 00:05:19,092
Aunt Drosselmayer!

29
00:05:19,195 --> 00:05:21,530
You're at least a head taller.

30
00:05:21,882 --> 00:05:23,548
I thought you weren't coming this year!

31
00:05:23,708 --> 00:05:28,222
And miss a chance to
visit you and vex my uncle?

32
00:05:28,942 --> 00:05:31,878
You're already conspiring against me.

33
00:05:31,950 --> 00:05:37,544
Don't worry! I'll wait until your party's
over before I perform any mischief.

34
00:05:39,233 --> 00:05:43,907
- Where did you go this time?
I want to hear all about it.
- Well, let's see.

35
00:05:44,426 --> 00:05:47,554
I met an Emperor, I sailed on a junk,

36
00:05:47,555 --> 00:05:53,955
I had my first rickshaw ride, and
I hiked the Great Wall of China.

37
00:05:54,025 --> 00:05:59,026
I'd appreciate it, Elizabeth, if you'd
stop filling Clara's head with your stories.

38
00:05:59,027 --> 00:06:03,827
Just because you go traipsing all over the globe
rather than stay put like a sensible person.

39
00:06:04,012 --> 00:06:09,167
There's a world full of wonders out there,
Uncle, and Clara deserves to experience them.

40
00:06:13,359 --> 00:06:14,896
Your guests are waiting.

41
00:06:19,749 --> 00:06:25,223
Some people never change.
But we can always hope.

42
00:06:35,755 --> 00:06:38,844
Then he bowed and asked me to dance.

43
00:06:39,116 --> 00:06:42,966
- Did you?
- I couldn't say no to the king!

44
00:06:43,318 --> 00:06:45,710
You must have felt like a princess.

45
00:06:45,754 --> 00:06:48,154
I wish I could've been there.

46
00:06:50,155 --> 00:06:53,285
Maybe next time you can come with me.

47
00:06:53,736 --> 00:06:55,523
Grandfather would never allow it.

48
00:06:56,824 --> 00:06:59,724
Well, surely he won't object to these.

49
00:07:04,024 --> 00:07:04,824
Tommy.

50
00:07:06,585 --> 00:07:09,614
And for you, my dear.

51
00:07:11,439 --> 00:07:16,441
Wow! A Grenadier guard and
a Bengal lancer! Thanks!

52
00:07:18,128 --> 00:07:20,465
A Nutcracker!

53
00:07:25,779 --> 00:07:30,312
He's wonderful! Thank
you, Aunt Elizabeth!

54
00:07:31,778 --> 00:07:35,206
- He sure is ugly.
- Tommy!

55
00:07:35,479 --> 00:07:39,980
Well on the outside, maybe.
But inside beats the heart of a Prince.

56
00:07:41,433 --> 00:07:43,420
Then I'll use him to command my army!

57
00:07:49,615 --> 00:07:51,051
Sorry.

58
00:07:52,495 --> 00:07:55,152
You're... impossible!

59
00:07:57,941 --> 00:08:01,098
Please don't be too angry with Tommy.

60
00:08:03,134 --> 00:08:04,945
I'm sure he didn't mean to hurt you.

61
00:08:25,930 --> 00:08:27,966
It's time to wake her.

62
00:08:28,086 --> 00:08:32,120
And spoil a beautiful dream?
No, let her sleep.

63
00:08:32,440 --> 00:08:37,113
Clara's not a child anymore. She
deserves the chance to follow her dreams.

64
00:08:37,486 --> 00:08:41,114
A young girl needs to be
responsible and practical.

65
00:08:41,467 --> 00:08:45,416
Clara is responsible. You've
raised her well, Uncle.

66
00:08:45,628 --> 00:08:48,970
It's time you trusted her to
grow up and make her own choices.

67
00:08:51,062 --> 00:08:54,291
It's late. I'll see you in the morning.

68
00:11:09,996 --> 00:11:11,980
Insolent mice!

69
00:11:25,329 --> 00:11:27,965
Get away from there.
Shoo! Shoo!

70
00:11:30,274 --> 00:11:33,611
Back... off... you... traitors!

71
00:11:34,502 --> 00:11:36,592
I must be dreaming.

72
00:11:53,842 --> 00:11:58,515
Even as a Nutcracker,
you're a thorn in my side.

73
00:11:58,935 --> 00:12:02,296
And a thorn to you I shall remain!

74
00:12:38,460 --> 00:12:43,033
It's time I turned you
into something more useful.

75
00:12:43,616 --> 00:12:45,016
Like kindling.

76
00:12:45,797 --> 00:12:47,827
Not in my house.

77
00:12:50,728 --> 00:12:56,774
"Meddling human, towering tall,
let my scepter shrink you small!"

78
00:12:57,446 --> 00:12:58,603
Look out!

79
00:13:07,321 --> 00:13:09,277
This is not good.

80
00:13:10,822 --> 00:13:13,851
Not so fierce now, hmm?

81
00:13:30,961 --> 00:13:32,497
Can you make it up to the mantle?

82
00:13:33,318 --> 00:13:35,506
There is no way...

83
00:13:37,291 --> 00:13:40,180
I'm staying down here.

84
00:14:14,999 --> 00:14:18,387
You've got nowhere to run, Nutcracker.

85
00:14:28,034 --> 00:14:34,116
You're not going to get away from me this time.
Unless you'd like to feed the fire.

86
00:14:40,390 --> 00:14:42,328
Nutcracker!

87
00:15:09,617 --> 00:15:12,305
Hey, up here!

88
00:15:36,394 --> 00:15:38,457
Come on.

89
00:15:38,458 --> 00:15:39,458
Uh-oh.

90
00:15:40,314 --> 00:15:43,004
Look out!

91
00:15:48,797 --> 00:15:52,394
Thank you for saving my life.

92
00:15:52,395 --> 00:15:55,295
And for your superior nursing skills.

93
00:15:55,559 --> 00:15:57,696
Uh, you're welcome.

94
00:15:59,788 --> 00:16:04,282
- This has to be a dream
- I'm afraid it's all too real.

95
00:16:05,026 --> 00:16:07,684
And I've got to return home to
Parthenia while I have the chance.

96
00:16:08,708 --> 00:16:11,963
Well then, would you mind
changing me back before you go?

97
00:16:12,037 --> 00:16:15,045
Remember? I used to be taller.

98
00:16:15,365 --> 00:16:19,326
I'm afraid only the Sugarplum Princess
can reverse the Mouse King's spell.

99
00:16:19,366 --> 00:16:21,904
The Sugarplum Princess?

100
00:16:22,256 --> 00:16:27,077
Yes. I've been trying to find her since
the Mouse King turned me into a nutcracker.

101
00:16:27,429 --> 00:16:29,067
You mean, you used to be...

102
00:16:29,087 --> 00:16:31,403
Not a nutcracker.

103
00:16:37,569 --> 00:16:40,577
Perhaps I can help.

104
00:16:43,758 --> 00:16:49,745
You will find the Sugarplum Princess
on an island, across the Sea of Storms.

105
00:16:50,097 --> 00:16:52,981
But it's impossible to
cross the Sea of Storms.

106
00:16:53,034 --> 00:16:56,462
It's dangerous, yes, but not impossible.

107
00:17:06,582 --> 00:17:14,185
- Well, are you coming?
- Me? With you? In there? I don't think so.

108
00:17:14,457 --> 00:17:19,558
Surely you don't want to spend the
rest of your life the size of a mouse?

109
00:17:20,975 --> 00:17:23,812
But how would I get back?

110
00:17:32,378 --> 00:17:35,417
Once you've found the Sugarplum Princess,

111
00:17:35,418 --> 00:17:39,418
open the locket, and you will
return home your normal size.

112
00:17:39,437 --> 00:17:40,972
But...

113
00:17:57,190 --> 00:18:00,168
- Ready?
- This is crazy.

114
00:18:00,520 --> 00:18:02,856
But, yes.

115
00:18:43,129 --> 00:18:48,866
- Where are we?
- Must've taken a wrong turn back there.

116
00:18:49,912 --> 00:18:55,613
- Where did my sword go?
- Here, let me give you a hand.

117
00:18:58,567 --> 00:19:02,603
- Uh...
- Sorry. That happens a lot.

118
00:19:09,326 --> 00:19:13,951
- A firefly?
- No. A Snow Fairy.

119
00:19:37,319 --> 00:19:42,141
Well I'm sorry, but you
should've ben more careful.

120
00:19:42,842 --> 00:19:46,442
Here. We'll fix this right up.

121
00:19:54,296 --> 00:19:56,654
Hmm, not so much as a thank you.

122
00:19:57,225 --> 00:20:00,014
Now, to find a way out of here.

123
00:20:06,479 --> 00:20:09,489
These walls are solid ice.

124
00:21:40,763 --> 00:21:43,199
Oh, no I...

125
00:22:57,223 --> 00:22:59,559
I guess that was their thank you.

126
00:23:00,132 --> 00:23:04,234
- Where'd they go?
- Probably off to make a blizzard somewhere.

127
00:23:18,614 --> 00:23:21,391
Welcome to Parthenia.

128
00:23:22,063 --> 00:23:25,171
It's so beautiful.

129
00:23:28,272 --> 00:23:30,689
The snow isn't even cold.

130
00:23:33,527 --> 00:23:39,413
The trees smell like peppermint.
And I've never seen a sky so blue.

131
00:23:40,414 --> 00:23:44,014
Soon it'll all be a memory
if the Mouse King has his way.

132
00:23:45,975 --> 00:23:49,383
And you're sure the
Sugarplum Princess can help?

133
00:23:49,456 --> 00:23:52,634
She's our only hope of defeating him.

134
00:23:54,298 --> 00:23:57,659
Hm! Interesting.

135
00:24:22,811 --> 00:24:25,699
Well? What news do you bring?

136
00:24:26,019 --> 00:24:32,358
I wish I could remember, but I'm
so hungry. I feel weak, no faint...

137
00:24:33,703 --> 00:24:38,647
You insolent little bat! I should
turn you into a ceiling fan!

138
00:24:39,721 --> 00:24:45,706
That would be a shame. Then I couldn't tell
you the juicy bit of gossip I overheard.

139
00:24:54,380 --> 00:25:01,743
Thank you very much, Your Most Royal Majesty.
May I say you're looking specially
regal this evening, Sire.

140
00:25:03,973 --> 00:25:07,928
Er, right. Well for starters, Nutcracker's back.

141
00:25:08,081 --> 00:25:10,166
What? Here?

142
00:25:10,738 --> 00:25:15,520
And he's got some girl with him.
Don't know where she came from.

143
00:25:15,540 --> 00:25:17,076
I do.

144
00:25:17,748 --> 00:25:20,295
Now here comes the good part.

145
00:25:20,296 --> 00:25:28,396
They're looking for a Sugarplum Princess
who can, supposedly, defeat... you.

146
00:25:29,432 --> 00:25:31,770
Err... according to the Nutcracker.

147
00:25:32,121 --> 00:25:34,458
Sugarplum Princess?

148
00:25:35,098 --> 00:25:38,779
I've never heard of a Sugarplum Princess.

149
00:25:40,372 --> 00:25:48,277
Bring me the royal registery.
And bring me the Nutcracker.

150
00:26:01,153 --> 00:26:03,492
It's what's left of the Gingerbread Village.

151
00:26:03,812 --> 00:26:06,521
Mouse King's work, no doubt.

152
00:26:08,922 --> 00:26:12,222
I didn't know things
had gotten this bad.

153
00:26:31,852 --> 00:26:35,834
Steady! We won't hurt you.

154
00:26:41,200 --> 00:26:43,535
It's an ambush! Take cover!

155
00:26:52,210 --> 00:26:56,100
It's alright. They're just children.

156
00:26:56,601 --> 00:26:59,601
With very good aim.

157
00:27:01,911 --> 00:27:06,512
Wait! We found this. Is she yours?

158
00:27:07,224 --> 00:27:08,567
Patty!

159
00:27:25,897 --> 00:27:27,663
What happened here?

160
00:27:27,782 --> 00:27:30,792
We went out with Marzipan
to gather candle berries.

161
00:27:30,944 --> 00:27:35,616
- We came back and everything...
- ...and everyone...
- ...were gone!

162
00:27:35,837 --> 00:27:37,953
It was the Mouse King's Army.

163
00:27:38,274 --> 00:27:40,610
This is all Prince Eric's fault.

164
00:27:41,129 --> 00:27:43,398
Who's Prince Eric?

165
00:27:43,420 --> 00:27:46,476
The son of the King who ruled
before the Mouse took over.

166
00:27:46,528 --> 00:27:48,813
Yeah, but he wasn't much of a Prince.

167
00:27:48,965 --> 00:27:52,294
The King left his throne and the
golden scepter to his Royal Advisor.

168
00:27:52,315 --> 00:27:53,758
The Mouse.

169
00:27:53,910 --> 00:27:56,456
Until the Price could
prove himself worthy.

170
00:27:56,547 --> 00:27:59,976
Let me guess. The Mouse
decided he liked being King.

171
00:28:00,097 --> 00:28:02,833
But what happened
to Prince Eric?

172
00:28:02,985 --> 00:28:06,734
- Don't know, don't care.
- We're better off without him.

173
00:28:07,260 --> 00:28:12,033
It's dangerous here. We'll travel
together until we can find you a safe home.

174
00:28:31,346 --> 00:28:34,356
The Mouse King's Army.

175
00:28:35,420 --> 00:28:38,856
Carrying what's left of our village.

176
00:28:44,694 --> 00:28:46,412
There they are!

177
00:28:48,401 --> 00:28:49,037
Come on!

178
00:28:50,709 --> 00:28:52,546
Come on, into the woods!

179
00:29:07,551 --> 00:29:09,051
They're getting closer!

180
00:29:09,203 --> 00:29:10,303
Up here!

181
00:29:10,465 --> 00:29:11,465
Get 'em!

182
00:29:22,644 --> 00:29:25,179
Is everyone alright?

183
00:29:25,652 --> 00:29:27,669
I'm not really sure.

184
00:29:27,889 --> 00:29:30,425
Well, what have we here?

185
00:29:30,677 --> 00:29:34,679
A wooden spy? Some new
kind of Mouse King trap?

186
00:29:35,592 --> 00:29:40,344
- Kidnappers, as well.
- No! They helped us!

187
00:29:40,637 --> 00:29:46,218
If you have nothing to hide, you
won't mind answering a few questions.

188
00:29:47,035 --> 00:29:51,037
Come, children. Masha
will take care of you.

189
00:30:04,306 --> 00:30:08,866
Let's start with who you are
and what you're doing here.

190
00:30:09,018 --> 00:30:14,052
I'm Nutcracker. This is Clara. We're
both victims of the Mouse King's magic.

191
00:30:14,212 --> 00:30:18,053
We're trying to find the only one who
can defeat him: the Sugarplum Princess.

192
00:30:18,212 --> 00:30:20,549
The Sugarplum Princess?

193
00:30:20,903 --> 00:30:24,390
I've never heard such a ridiculous story!

194
00:30:24,583 --> 00:30:27,752
It's the truth. Told to
me by Prince Eric himself.

195
00:30:28,071 --> 00:30:32,791
Ha! Prince Eric! He's the
reason we're in the mess.

196
00:30:32,792 --> 00:30:38,392
If it weren't for that reckless boy, the Mouse
King wouldn't be turning everyone into knick-knacks.

197
00:30:38,411 --> 00:30:40,748
You make the Prince sound pretty awful.

198
00:30:40,941 --> 00:30:47,278
Awful? That's a compliment. He was
useless, lazy, and irresponsible...

199
00:30:47,438 --> 00:30:50,927
Major Mint, you're forgetting
that Prince Eric was my friend.

200
00:30:51,279 --> 00:30:56,785
Captain Candy, you're forgetting
that I am your superior.

201
00:30:57,950 --> 00:31:02,451
I had high hopes for that boy.
Oh, no matter.

202
00:31:02,471 --> 00:31:04,761
I've got more important
things to think about, like...

203
00:31:04,821 --> 00:31:09,621
keeping what's left of our
subjects safe from the Mouse King!

204
00:31:09,622 --> 00:31:12,570
Then perhaps you should be
looking for the Princess too.

205
00:31:12,631 --> 00:31:17,976
I don't have time to search for
some "Sugarpie"... well whatever.

206
00:31:18,188 --> 00:31:22,117
- Sugarplum.
- Imaginary Princess.

207
00:31:22,137 --> 00:31:25,147
Wait, Major!
They may be telling the truth.

208
00:31:25,199 --> 00:31:30,099
I once overheard the King telling
Prince Eric about this powerful Princess.

209
00:31:30,100 --> 00:31:32,777
The King Himself believed in her magic.

210
00:31:32,749 --> 00:31:37,149
And we've tried everything
else to defeat the Mouse.

211
00:31:37,150 --> 00:31:39,487
Do you know where she is?

212
00:31:39,678 --> 00:31:43,008
We've learned she's on an
island, across the Sea of Storms.

213
00:31:46,669 --> 00:31:54,440
Oh, very well. We'll all go looking for the Sugarplum
Princess. But I'll be in charge of the expedition!

214
00:31:55,205 --> 00:31:56,869
Of course.

215
00:31:58,853 --> 00:32:05,372
- Do you know what became of Prince Eric?
- The Mouse King destroyed him.

216
00:32:10,282 --> 00:32:17,001
So, you're telling me that the
Nutcracker, a wooden utensil,

217
00:32:17,002 --> 00:32:22,902
managed to escape a well-armed
fighting squadron unharmed?

218
00:32:23,565 --> 00:32:30,575
And instead of fleeing into the hills, you chose
to return to me and report your incompetence.

219
00:32:30,576 --> 00:32:33,876
Yeah-huh.
(Gulp)

220
00:32:34,897 --> 00:32:38,578
Why don't you just blast
'em with your scepter, Sire?

221
00:32:39,250 --> 00:32:41,587
I suppose I could.

222
00:32:46,933 --> 00:32:53,279
But I find its power to transform the
incompetent much more gratifying.

223
00:32:53,391 --> 00:32:57,553
The trick is: making you useful.

224
00:32:57,554 --> 00:32:58,554
Pimm.

225
00:32:58,937 --> 00:33:06,619
- How are we doing with statuary?
- Eh, full up, your Lordiness.

226
00:33:06,939 --> 00:33:12,957
- Lawn ornaments?
- Too much ornament, not enough lawn.

227
00:33:14,302 --> 00:33:18,304
- Paperweights?
- Covered.

228
00:33:19,296 --> 00:33:23,297
What does one create for the
palace that has everything?

229
00:33:23,969 --> 00:33:29,986
- How 'bout bookends since there's two of 'em.
- Wonderful idea, Pimm.

230
00:33:30,068 --> 00:33:33,668
I do believe I'm starting
to rub off on you.

231
00:33:33,669 --> 00:33:41,319
"Since other tasks posed a challenge to thee,
you shall be bookends for eternity!"

232
00:33:57,548 --> 00:34:05,197
Here it is. "The Sugarplum
Princess: Kind, clever, and brave."!

233
00:34:06,898 --> 00:34:08,598
That's it?!

234
00:34:11,376 --> 00:34:13,199
Where is she?

235
00:34:19,019 --> 00:34:25,045
I suppose I'll just have to reduce the Nutcracker
to a pile of splinters before he can find her.

236
00:34:26,068 --> 00:34:33,719
"Rock that will walk, destroy whom I seek,
carnage and havoc will be yours to wreak!"

237
00:34:57,599 --> 00:35:02,111
Find the wooden man and crush him!

238
00:35:11,832 --> 00:35:18,790
Follow him, Pimm. He's a bit rough around
the edges and may need some guidance.

239
00:35:19,010 --> 00:35:22,519
You want me to babysit a rock?

240
00:35:24,135 --> 00:35:27,865
Alright, alright! Better than being a rock.

241
00:35:37,391 --> 00:35:39,791
What about Marzipan?

242
00:35:39,992 --> 00:35:44,559
I'm sure she'll be fine. And you'll be
staying here with Masha until we get back.

243
00:35:45,011 --> 00:35:48,174
- Okay?
- Okay.

244
00:35:49,187 --> 00:35:52,549
- Goodnight.
- Goodnight, Clara!

245
00:35:59,247 --> 00:36:00,971
Can't sleep?

246
00:36:01,023 --> 00:36:05,372
I'm a nutcracker. Sleep
seems kind of pointless.

247
00:36:05,844 --> 00:36:09,685
You're more than a nutcracker, Prince Eric.

248
00:36:11,191 --> 00:36:13,526
Why haven't you told anyone?

249
00:36:13,799 --> 00:36:20,166
I-I didn't want to be the price when I
had the chance. Now I don't deserve to be.

250
00:36:20,557 --> 00:36:24,483
That's not true! You're risking
your life to save your kingdom.

251
00:36:24,504 --> 00:36:26,874
Isn't that what Princes do?

252
00:36:26,875 --> 00:36:30,064
But my subjects think less of
me than they do the Mouse King.

253
00:36:30,203 --> 00:36:35,551
My only hope is to find the Sugarplum Princess
so she can help me restore my peoples' happiness.

254
00:36:35,852 --> 00:36:37,652
I owe them that.

255
00:36:53,572 --> 00:36:56,262
Aha! There's our bridge.

256
00:36:57,054 --> 00:37:00,684
Perhaps we should find a safer place to cross.

257
00:37:00,934 --> 00:37:05,256
Perhaps you should remember who's
in charge of this expedition.

258
00:37:16,192 --> 00:37:21,294
Heh heh! Right-o. No problem
at all. Heh heh, come along.

259
00:37:40,499 --> 00:37:41,799
Tricky.

260
00:37:48,982 --> 00:37:50,999
Help!

261
00:37:55,673 --> 00:37:57,657
Please, hurry!

262
00:38:08,458 --> 00:38:10,758
I'll be gobstrack.

263
00:38:11,350 --> 00:38:13,866
Hurry!

264
00:38:20,153 --> 00:38:23,560
Sorry. Didn't have any rope.

265
00:38:42,007 --> 00:38:48,753
- Are you sure you're alright to travel?
- I'm fine. Please, don't worry about me.

266
00:38:48,906 --> 00:38:54,140
Bad luck about your knapsack. Now
we'll be needing more supplies!

267
00:38:54,411 --> 00:38:58,412
Supplies? Thanks to you, I
almost fell into the ravine!

268
00:38:59,085 --> 00:39:04,750
Don't blame me for your sloppy
footwork, General Clumsiness.

269
00:39:05,103 --> 00:39:07,439
Clumsy? I'm clumsy?

270
00:39:10,186 --> 00:39:15,486
- You're the bundling clod-hopper!
- Who was dangling from a branch?

271
00:39:15,487 --> 00:39:18,887
Whose leadership skills put me there?

272
00:39:18,983 --> 00:39:25,189
- That was very noble of you.
- Least I could do for an old friend.

273
00:39:35,600 --> 00:39:41,646
The Captain and I will make a boat sea
worthy, while you two gather supplies.

274
00:39:45,627 --> 00:39:48,476
Clara, come with me.

275
00:39:54,142 --> 00:39:55,751
The well used to be over there.

276
00:40:08,374 --> 00:40:11,679
Here it is. Well, somebody must've capped it.

277
00:40:29,095 --> 00:40:31,211
You're welcome.

278
00:40:32,453 --> 00:40:37,456
The Mouse King's Army destroyed this
valley and trapped them in the well.

279
00:40:45,903 --> 00:40:47,215
What?

280
00:40:47,688 --> 00:40:50,577
They say you're beautiful.

281
00:41:33,461 --> 00:41:35,864
Supplies!

282
00:42:48,325 --> 00:42:49,228
Run!

283
00:43:02,114 --> 00:43:04,214
Major! Captain!

284
00:43:04,315 --> 00:43:10,498
What's she carrying on about now?
Probably saw a snake or a spider or a...

285
00:43:10,531 --> 00:43:11,902
Rock giant!

286
00:43:14,341 --> 00:43:17,110
Great googly!

287
00:43:17,943 --> 00:43:23,347
There he is! Right there! Blimey, I'm blind
as a bat and even I can see him!

288
00:43:24,055 --> 00:43:26,925
Major, Captain, over here!

289
00:43:37,578 --> 00:43:42,753
I worked on that sail a good
half hour! You cheeky blighter!

290
00:43:43,422 --> 00:43:47,194
Why don't you invite him over for
tea and cakes while you're at it!

291
00:44:04,292 --> 00:44:05,794
Look!

292
00:44:25,963 --> 00:44:27,633
It's Marzipan!

293
00:44:27,867 --> 00:44:30,306
Come on, before the Snow Fairies disappear!

294
00:45:00,699 --> 00:45:04,499
Ah, he'll break right through that ice!

295
00:45:06,900 --> 00:45:10,900
It seems the Snow Fairies
did their job too well.

296
00:45:21,699 --> 00:45:24,899
A sword's not going to do you any good, lad.

297
00:45:25,800 --> 00:45:28,239
You'll be pulverized!

298
00:45:28,440 --> 00:45:35,752
- Be careful!
- Don't worry, wood floats...
rock doesn't!

299
00:45:37,756 --> 00:45:41,393
- Hurry! Hurry!
- Put some zing in it!

300
00:46:02,699 --> 00:46:06,538
If this fog doesn't lift, we'll
never find the Princess's island.

301
00:46:06,571 --> 00:46:09,871
And if we don't? You battled the Mouse Army,

302
00:46:09,872 --> 00:46:14,158
rescued Captain Candy, and saved
us from a vicious pile of rock!

303
00:46:14,159 --> 00:46:17,159
All without the Sugarplum Princess.

304
00:46:18,427 --> 00:46:21,498
The Mouse King is too
powerful to take on alone.

305
00:46:21,632 --> 00:46:25,771
Besides, we've gotta find the Princess
if you're to return home your true size.

306
00:46:26,307 --> 00:46:30,849
- That is what you want, isn't it?
- Of course.

307
00:46:43,204 --> 00:46:45,875
Nutcracker destroyed rock?

308
00:46:46,077 --> 00:46:49,077
And sent him to the bottom of the sea.

309
00:46:49,178 --> 00:46:53,756
Of course he had some help. Major
Mint and Captain Candy have joined up.

310
00:46:53,891 --> 00:46:57,061
Proving they're gullible idiots.

311
00:46:57,430 --> 00:47:02,278
I've combed through every page of
every book in the Royal Library,

312
00:47:02,445 --> 00:47:06,945
and there's no other mention
of a Sugarplum Princess.

313
00:47:06,946 --> 00:47:11,253
I don't know. They were pretty
keen on finding her island.

314
00:47:11,654 --> 00:47:14,154
She's a fantasy!

315
00:47:14,155 --> 00:47:24,155
But if Nutcracker wants to believe in fairy tales,
he's about to find out this one doesn't
have a happy ending.

316
00:47:33,892 --> 00:47:38,332
Weather's getting worse.
I say we turn about.

317
00:47:39,302 --> 00:47:40,137
Wait!

318
00:47:40,171 --> 00:47:44,952
It's too dangerous! There's been
no sign of this mysterious island.

319
00:47:44,953 --> 00:47:48,253
Not to mention what's going to
happen when this ice starts to melt.

320
00:47:48,353 --> 00:47:54,195
Marzipan saw something.
I'm sure of it.

321
00:48:10,224 --> 00:48:14,698
No time to enjoy the scenery.
Let's find this Princess.

322
00:48:14,732 --> 00:48:19,070
I believe the Nutcracker has
earned the right to lead us.

323
00:48:19,238 --> 00:48:21,376
But-but... he's wood!

324
00:48:21,409 --> 00:48:24,115
And the reason we've made it this far.

325
00:48:24,216 --> 00:48:26,253
I'm only half the reason.

326
00:48:30,660 --> 00:48:37,404
Handing the reigns to a-a stump!
I never heard of such a thing!

327
00:49:08,292 --> 00:49:11,732
- Are you coming?
- Oh, yes.

328
00:49:44,790 --> 00:49:49,463
- Gotcha mates! Off to the palace!
- No!

329
00:49:53,406 --> 00:49:57,110
Wait a minute. Where's the girl?

330
00:49:58,811 --> 00:50:03,811
Don't matter. No way off this island.
Unless she's part mermaid.

331
00:50:21,086 --> 00:50:27,931
I should never have come. What was I thinking?
That I was going to find a magical Princess?

332
00:50:28,666 --> 00:50:35,676
I could always go back home. I'm sure
I've got some doll clothes that would fit.

333
00:50:37,114 --> 00:50:41,990
What am I saying? I can't leave.
I'm their only hope.

334
00:50:42,492 --> 00:50:46,231
If I could just get off this island.

335
00:50:46,932 --> 00:50:48,370
Hello!

336
00:51:06,666 --> 00:51:09,153
Are you sure about this?

337
00:51:13,854 --> 00:51:17,454
Okay then. Let's go-ooo!

338
00:51:48,105 --> 00:51:49,675
Thank you.

339
00:52:14,151 --> 00:52:18,124
They're right. It's time
we stood up to the Mouse.

340
00:52:32,985 --> 00:52:38,828
More wood. I want this to
be an unforgettable show.

341
00:52:59,899 --> 00:53:08,379
Pimm, all is right with the world.
I got the Nutcracker and soon my
worries will be over.

342
00:53:08,613 --> 00:53:13,369
Well, that ain't really so true, Sire.

343
00:53:13,370 --> 00:53:15,270
Oh?

344
00:53:16,170 --> 00:53:22,470
- It seems your subjects are
planning an uh... uprising.
- What?!

345
00:53:22,903 --> 00:53:31,954
I want every last villager, fairy, and general
trouble-maker rounded up to witness
this display of my absolute power!

346
00:53:31,987 --> 00:53:34,760
I'll get right on it, Sire.

347
00:53:37,665 --> 00:53:41,605
Ah, Sire? I can't feel my toes.

348
00:54:00,137 --> 00:54:04,560
Oh, there you are! The King needs
you right away in the courtyard.

349
00:54:04,561 --> 00:54:10,661
And he said if you didn't hurry, you'd
spend the rest of your lives as houseflies.

350
00:54:10,662 --> 00:54:13,562
Or was it horseflies?

351
00:54:33,831 --> 00:54:35,434
Clara!

352
00:54:39,673 --> 00:54:44,514
- What's wrong with the girl?
- We can see her, but she can't see us.

353
00:54:45,016 --> 00:54:47,853
Or hear us, apparently.

354
00:54:48,255 --> 00:54:52,862
Why would the Mouse King post
guards on an empty room?

355
00:54:53,432 --> 00:54:55,168
Clara.

356
00:55:24,887 --> 00:55:29,160
We've got to get out of here.
The Mouse King's building a bonfire.

357
00:55:29,194 --> 00:55:32,265
I doubt it's to warm up the palace.

358
00:55:49,597 --> 00:55:54,971
Sugarplum Princess or no Sugarplum
Princess, that rat's got to be stopped!

359
00:55:57,243 --> 00:56:04,320
- Is this any way to run a Kingdom, Mouse?
- Ahh. You're just in time for your party.

360
00:56:15,741 --> 00:56:19,347
There's more to being a
King than having a crown!

361
00:56:20,351 --> 00:56:23,388
Suddenly you're an expert.

362
00:56:23,655 --> 00:56:27,896
You'll never gain their loyalty
until you've earned their respect!

363
00:56:27,930 --> 00:56:32,704
I don't need their loyalty.
I don't even need them.

364
00:56:33,640 --> 00:56:39,716
"Those peasants who do challenge me,
living statuary be!"

365
00:56:42,586 --> 00:56:43,786
Clara!

366
00:56:59,617 --> 00:57:06,017
Scrappy little Nutcracker. I'm
afraid I've underestimated you.

367
00:57:06,097 --> 00:57:13,776
"With the brawn of twenty and six
I'll smash my enemy into sticks."

368
00:57:29,238 --> 00:57:30,807
Nutcracker!

369
00:57:31,041 --> 00:57:37,586
I'll give you a choice, Nutcracker,
dismemberment or barbeque.

370
00:57:37,919 --> 00:57:43,294
No! You're nothing but a coward,
hiding behind a magic wand!

371
00:57:43,528 --> 00:57:49,539
I obviously didn't shrink you small
enough. Your mouth is still much too big.

372
00:57:49,573 --> 00:57:53,179
But that is about to change.

373
00:57:53,281 --> 00:57:59,123
"To the one who vexes me,
smaller, smaller you will be!"

374
00:57:59,124 --> 00:58:00,524
Nooo!

375
00:58:05,125 --> 00:58:06,925
What? Ahh!

376
00:58:21,895 --> 00:58:25,769
Back to where he belongs -
The sewer!

377
00:58:26,370 --> 00:58:29,843
Oh! My poor Nutcracker.

378
00:58:29,911 --> 00:58:35,586
Don't worry, Clara, I'm just wood.
Remember?

379
00:58:35,654 --> 00:58:42,098
You and I know you're
much more than that. Prince Eric.

380
00:58:54,921 --> 00:58:58,960
- It's Prince Eric!
- The Prince?!

381
00:58:59,899 --> 00:59:00,599
The Prince.

382
00:59:22,237 --> 00:59:28,046
- Of course. The Princess has
been with us all along!
- What?

383
00:59:28,113 --> 00:59:35,057
- Clara, it's you! You are the Sugarplum Princess!
- Me? I couldn't be.

384
00:59:35,191 --> 00:59:39,344
It all makes sense. You saved me
from the Mouse King in your parlor.

385
00:59:39,345 --> 00:59:43,145
You rescued us from his dungeon,
your bravery led to his defeat,

386
00:59:43,146 --> 00:59:45,746
and your kiss has broken his spell.

387
00:59:45,778 --> 00:59:51,188
- You are the Sugarplum Princess!
- Look!

388
01:00:16,231 --> 01:00:20,070
You've broken all the Mouse
King's evil enchantments.

389
01:00:20,106 --> 01:00:24,048
And now you're free to take
your rightful place as King.

390
01:00:24,049 --> 01:00:26,649
Well, that's for the people to decide.

391
01:00:27,518 --> 01:00:35,322
- Three cheers for Prince Eric!
- Hip hip, hurray! Hip hip, hurray!
Hip hip, hurray!

392
01:05:24,337 --> 01:05:26,037
Thank you, friends.

393
01:05:26,038 --> 01:05:31,315
As your King, I will let the wise
leadership of my Father be my guide.

394
01:05:35,724 --> 01:05:42,103
None of this would've been possible
without you, Clara. Will you stay...
and be my Queen?

395
01:05:42,936 --> 01:05:48,616
This locket was supposed to take me home,
but in my heart, I feel I'm already there.

396
01:06:01,770 --> 01:06:07,312
I absolutely despise happy endings!

397
01:06:12,289 --> 01:06:13,825
- No!
- No!

398
01:06:13,859 --> 01:06:16,829
He's not gonna get away with that!

399
01:06:19,702 --> 01:06:21,702
Pimm!

400
01:06:21,903 --> 01:06:24,776
Flap, you fool!

401
01:06:30,522 --> 01:06:35,499
- Clara! No!
- Eric!
-Clara!

402
01:06:39,169 --> 01:06:41,871
I love you!

403
01:06:59,204 --> 01:07:01,240
Nutcracker?

404
01:07:13,630 --> 01:07:16,033
It's about time you got up.

405
01:07:16,167 --> 01:07:18,809
I see the mice had a party
of their own last night.

406
01:07:18,837 --> 01:07:21,751
It wasn't a party.
It was a war.

407
01:07:21,752 --> 01:07:26,152
The Nutcracker was fighting the Mouse
King, who shrunk me with his golden scepter.

408
01:07:26,185 --> 01:07:29,289
I've never heard such a story,
even from your Aunt!

409
01:07:29,324 --> 01:07:31,995
It's not a story! 
It really happened!

410
01:07:32,029 --> 01:07:37,203
- Time to open presents!
- Tommy, did you take my Nutcracker?

411
01:07:37,238 --> 01:07:40,709
- Why would I want him?
He's just a hunck of wood.
- You're wrong!

412
01:07:41,042 --> 01:07:45,350
He's really a King. An evil
mouse was ruling his land.

413
01:07:45,384 --> 01:07:48,954
- The mouse had a bat.
- What's all this foolishness?

414
01:07:48,988 --> 01:07:52,496
Perhaps I should send for a doctor.

415
01:07:52,798 --> 01:07:54,969
And this is where I grew up.

416
01:07:55,003 --> 01:08:00,310
Aunt Elizabeth, have you seen my...
Nutcracker?

417
01:08:00,344 --> 01:08:04,785
Look who I ran into while I
was taking my morning stroll.

418
01:08:04,819 --> 01:08:13,165
Uncle Drosselmayer, Clara, Tommy.
This is Eric, the son of a dear friend of mine.

419
01:08:14,035 --> 01:08:17,709
I'm very happy to... meet you.

420
01:08:20,313 --> 01:08:24,082
Such familiarity!
In my day we would never have...

421
01:08:24,087 --> 01:08:28,426
I've taken the liberty of asking
Eric to stay for Christmas dinner.

422
01:08:28,560 --> 01:08:29,830
But this is a most...

423
01:08:29,833 --> 01:08:32,701
wonderful idea.

424
01:08:35,640 --> 01:08:40,113
I suppose it wouldn't hurt to
have the young man stay for supper.

425
01:08:44,488 --> 01:08:46,692
But what about the presents?

426
01:08:57,579 --> 01:09:00,729
May I have this dance?

427
01:09:03,930 --> 01:09:07,530
I couldn't say no to the King.

428
01:09:46,363 --> 01:09:52,507
So, if Clara hadn't been brave, she never
would've found out she was a Princess.

429
01:09:52,640 --> 01:09:54,511
That's right.

430
01:09:56,282 --> 01:10:00,221
Can you help me practice until
I know all the steps?

431
01:10:00,354 --> 01:10:02,426
Of course.

432
01:11:50,916 --> 01:11:55,457
- I did it!
- I always knew you could.

433
01:12:08,228 --> 01:12:10,328
