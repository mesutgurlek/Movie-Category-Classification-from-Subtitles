1
00:01:11,430 --> 00:01:15,218
THE UMBRELLAS
OF CHERBOURG

2
00:02:32,910 --> 00:02:36,823
FIRST PART: THE DEPARTURE

3
00:03:00,270 --> 00:03:01,942
Is it finished?

4
00:03:04,230 --> 00:03:07,666
The engine still knocks
when it´s cold, but that´s normal.

5
00:03:33,830 --> 00:03:34,785
Foucher!

6
00:03:36,390 --> 00:03:38,824
Can you stay an extra hour?

7
00:03:39,910 --> 00:03:42,060
Tonight, it´s a problem.

8
00:03:42,230 --> 00:03:44,380
But I think Pierre is free.

9
00:03:44,550 --> 00:03:48,020
Pierre, can you stay tonight?

10
00:03:49,670 --> 00:03:53,663
Check the ignition
on the gentleman´s Mercedes.

11
00:04:01,310 --> 00:04:03,301
Are you coming to the game?

12
00:04:03,470 --> 00:04:04,983
No, I can´t.

13
00:04:05,470 --> 00:04:06,949
Are you going?

14
00:04:07,310 --> 00:04:08,743
Sure.

15
00:04:14,150 --> 00:04:17,745
Aubin asked me
to stay overtime... No way!

16
00:04:17,990 --> 00:04:20,663
Tonight is special!
I´m going to the theater.

17
00:04:20,830 --> 00:04:22,661
What are they playing?

18
00:04:22,830 --> 00:04:24,468
Carmen!

19
00:04:29,630 --> 00:04:33,100
I don´t like operas.
Movies are better.

20
00:04:34,790 --> 00:04:37,429
I´m going dancing tonight.

21
00:04:39,430 --> 00:04:40,783
Give me a smoke.

22
00:04:42,190 --> 00:04:45,182
All that singing
gives me a pain.

23
00:04:46,550 --> 00:04:48,029
I like movies better.

24
00:04:48,190 --> 00:04:50,101
You´ve said so already.

25
00:04:56,630 --> 00:04:59,190
See you tomorrow.

26
00:05:34,630 --> 00:05:38,179
My love...
Oh my love.

27
00:05:38,550 --> 00:05:41,542
Geneviéve,
my little Geneviéve.

28
00:05:41,710 --> 00:05:43,940
Guy, I love you.

29
00:05:45,430 --> 00:05:47,466
You smell of gasoline.

30
00:05:49,030 --> 00:05:52,102
It´s just another perfume.

31
00:05:52,270 --> 00:05:56,104
Guy, I love you...
Oh Guy, I love you.

32
00:05:56,950 --> 00:05:59,259
A customer, I must run.

33
00:05:59,430 --> 00:06:02,342
See you at 8
in front of the theater.

34
00:06:09,430 --> 00:06:12,547
I´ve thought of you all day!

35
00:06:12,710 --> 00:06:16,180
Would you like
to go dancing later?

36
00:06:16,350 --> 00:06:18,261
If you wish.

37
00:06:25,950 --> 00:06:27,269
Can I help you?

38
00:06:27,430 --> 00:06:28,943
An umbrella.

39
00:06:32,710 --> 00:06:33,984
Where were you?

40
00:06:34,710 --> 00:06:37,019
Just across the street.

41
00:06:38,870 --> 00:06:44,263
Have you decided
which kind you would like?

42
00:06:45,790 --> 00:06:48,702
An umbrella.
A black umbrella.

43
00:06:48,870 --> 00:06:52,465
Geneviéve, show the gentleman
the umbrellas.

44
00:07:13,270 --> 00:07:14,544
Is that you, Guy?

45
00:07:15,190 --> 00:07:17,181
Good evening, Aunt Elise.

46
00:07:18,030 --> 00:07:20,544
Good evening, my boy.

47
00:07:29,790 --> 00:07:31,860
How are your legs?

48
00:07:32,270 --> 00:07:34,864
Fine, my boy.

49
00:07:35,790 --> 00:07:37,860
What are you up to?

50
00:07:38,870 --> 00:07:40,383
I´m hungry.

51
00:07:41,710 --> 00:07:44,099
You´ll spoil your appetite.

52
00:07:44,350 --> 00:07:46,545
I do what I please.

53
00:07:49,430 --> 00:07:53,343
Calm down and talk to me.

54
00:07:54,350 --> 00:07:56,625
I haven´t much time.

55
00:07:59,710 --> 00:08:02,622
You seem very nervous.

56
00:08:03,030 --> 00:08:04,622
I´m going out.

57
00:08:04,790 --> 00:08:05,939
Alone?

58
00:08:06,110 --> 00:08:08,943
None of your business.

59
00:08:10,030 --> 00:08:11,258
I think it is.

60
00:08:11,430 --> 00:08:13,102
With a girl.

61
00:08:13,270 --> 00:08:14,783
Do you love her?

62
00:08:14,950 --> 00:08:16,099
It could be.

63
00:08:16,270 --> 00:08:17,623
Tell me the truth.

64
00:08:17,870 --> 00:08:19,269
Yes, I love her.

65
00:08:19,430 --> 00:08:21,068
What´s the matter?
You´re crying!

66
00:08:21,230 --> 00:08:22,219
No, I´m not.

67
00:08:22,390 --> 00:08:24,301
I can see that you are.

68
00:08:25,510 --> 00:08:27,660
Is it because you are lonely?

69
00:08:28,670 --> 00:08:31,503
I am not lonely.
I have my books.

70
00:08:31,750 --> 00:08:34,139
Madeleine will give me my shot.

71
00:08:34,750 --> 00:08:36,661
She will keep me company.

72
00:08:36,830 --> 00:08:38,058
What then?

73
00:08:38,230 --> 00:08:41,745
Maybe happiness
makes me sad.

74
00:08:42,070 --> 00:08:43,469
That´s silly.

75
00:08:44,470 --> 00:08:47,030
You big brute,
you´re messing up my hair.

76
00:08:51,590 --> 00:08:53,865
Good evening, Guy.

77
00:08:54,030 --> 00:08:55,429
Good evening, Madeleine.

78
00:08:57,870 --> 00:08:59,019
You are sad.

79
00:09:00,390 --> 00:09:03,700
You seem happy.

80
00:09:05,990 --> 00:09:07,423
Does it show?

81
00:09:27,150 --> 00:09:28,424
I had a terrible time...

82
00:09:28,590 --> 00:09:29,579
Why?

83
00:09:30,430 --> 00:09:33,661
Persuading Mother.
It was getting late,

84
00:09:33,830 --> 00:09:36,503
and the seamstress was late.

85
00:09:37,510 --> 00:09:38,659
Look.

86
00:09:39,630 --> 00:09:44,465
Careful,
it is still full of pins.

87
00:10:44,470 --> 00:10:45,869
You know,

88
00:10:46,230 --> 00:10:48,983
I think
she suspects something.

89
00:10:49,910 --> 00:10:50,820
Who?

90
00:10:51,470 --> 00:10:52,619
Mother.

91
00:10:52,790 --> 00:10:56,624
When I said I was going
to the theater with Cécile,

92
00:10:58,430 --> 00:11:02,105
she gave me
a funny look.

93
00:11:02,350 --> 00:11:03,783
What kind of a look?

94
00:11:03,950 --> 00:11:05,019
Like that.

95
00:11:05,190 --> 00:11:08,500
She knows quite well
that Cécile hates shows,

96
00:11:08,710 --> 00:11:10,541
and as I am a very bad liar...

97
00:11:10,790 --> 00:11:12,348
That´s what you say!

98
00:11:12,510 --> 00:11:15,627
I assure you, I´m very awkward.

99
00:11:15,790 --> 00:11:18,304
I stammered, I blushed...

100
00:11:18,470 --> 00:11:21,189
I immediately
changed the subject.

101
00:11:25,910 --> 00:11:27,548
Something squeezed.

102
00:11:28,230 --> 00:11:29,743
Something?

103
00:11:30,150 --> 00:11:31,742
Lemon.

104
00:11:31,910 --> 00:11:33,389
The same.

105
00:11:45,270 --> 00:11:46,703
Do you love me?

106
00:11:49,190 --> 00:11:50,942
A mambo, let´s go!

107
00:11:53,350 --> 00:11:55,102
I should have changed shoes.

108
00:12:10,910 --> 00:12:13,378
We will have children.

109
00:12:13,750 --> 00:12:16,742
I will call my daughter
Françoise.

110
00:12:16,910 --> 00:12:18,309
And if it´s a boy?

111
00:12:18,470 --> 00:12:20,222
It will be a girl.

112
00:12:20,390 --> 00:12:23,905
We´ve always had girls
in the family.

113
00:12:30,910 --> 00:12:31,899
One o´clock.

114
00:12:32,070 --> 00:12:37,827
If Mother is not asleep,
what a scene there will be.

115
00:12:38,150 --> 00:12:41,381
I should wear make-up,
don´t you think ?

116
00:12:42,310 --> 00:12:45,143
You´re lovely as you are.

117
00:12:45,910 --> 00:12:47,582
A little bit here.

118
00:12:47,750 --> 00:12:48,580
Where?

119
00:12:48,750 --> 00:12:49,626
There.

120
00:12:56,750 --> 00:12:59,548
We will sell umbrellas.

121
00:13:00,070 --> 00:13:02,664
No, not umbrellas.

122
00:13:03,230 --> 00:13:04,902
We will sell the shop.

123
00:13:05,070 --> 00:13:08,380
We will buy a gas station.

124
00:13:08,550 --> 00:13:10,302
Why? What an idea!

125
00:13:11,230 --> 00:13:14,825
All white, with an office,
you will see.

126
00:13:15,150 --> 00:13:18,460
You´ll smell of gas all day.

127
00:13:18,670 --> 00:13:19,989
What happiness...

128
00:13:21,630 --> 00:13:23,746
We will be very happy...

129
00:13:24,510 --> 00:13:27,502
And we will stay in love...

130
00:13:37,750 --> 00:13:39,263
You haven´t told your mother?

131
00:13:39,430 --> 00:13:40,658
Not yet.

132
00:13:40,830 --> 00:13:42,821
Why? You´re a coward.

133
00:13:43,910 --> 00:13:46,982
You must not get mad.

134
00:13:47,150 --> 00:13:49,983
I know what she will say.

135
00:13:50,310 --> 00:13:51,663
What?

136
00:13:52,230 --> 00:13:56,064
„My little girl, you´re crazy.
Thinking of marriage at your age!“

137
00:13:57,550 --> 00:13:59,984
My little girl, you´re crazy.
Thinking of marriage at 16!

138
00:14:00,150 --> 00:14:00,787
17.

139
00:14:00,950 --> 00:14:01,905
In love!

140
00:14:02,070 --> 00:14:03,662
Am I too ugly or too stupid?

141
00:14:03,830 --> 00:14:06,583
No, you´re not ugly.
You´re not the fairest of them all,

142
00:14:06,750 --> 00:14:08,820
but you´re neither ugly nor dumb.

143
00:14:08,990 --> 00:14:11,060
The thing is,
you have plenty of time.

144
00:14:11,230 --> 00:14:13,221
You think you are in love.

145
00:14:13,750 --> 00:14:16,583
But love is something different.

146
00:14:17,270 --> 00:14:19,943
You do not just fall

147
00:14:20,390 --> 00:14:23,666
in love with a face

148
00:14:23,910 --> 00:14:26,663
that you´ve seen in the street.

149
00:14:28,670 --> 00:14:33,664
He is a young man
whom I´ve met several times

150
00:14:33,830 --> 00:14:36,469
and he loves me.

151
00:14:37,590 --> 00:14:40,309
We want to get married.

152
00:14:41,830 --> 00:14:43,821
You do not answer?

153
00:14:45,390 --> 00:14:47,460
I am flabbergasted.

154
00:14:47,630 --> 00:14:51,942
I went with him
to the theater last night.

155
00:14:52,110 --> 00:14:55,102
Great!
So you lied to me and...

156
00:14:55,270 --> 00:14:58,421
you admit it
without any shame.

157
00:14:58,710 --> 00:15:02,259
There is no shame
in wanting to get married.

158
00:15:02,830 --> 00:15:05,902
At your age, there is...
well, no...

159
00:15:08,310 --> 00:15:11,222
You are a little girl,
very littIe.

160
00:15:12,470 --> 00:15:15,382
You know nothing.

161
00:15:17,310 --> 00:15:21,383
It´s not with what you taught me
that I can manage.

162
00:15:21,550 --> 00:15:23,984
When I married your Dad,
I knew nothing.

163
00:15:24,150 --> 00:15:26,027
That´s not something
to brag about.

164
00:15:26,190 --> 00:15:27,543
The paint shop, please?

165
00:15:27,710 --> 00:15:28,984
Next door.

166
00:15:29,870 --> 00:15:31,269
How old is he?

167
00:15:31,430 --> 00:15:32,863
20.

168
00:15:33,030 --> 00:15:37,103
Obviously,
he hasn´t been in the army.

169
00:15:41,190 --> 00:15:43,988
He lives with his godmother,

170
00:15:44,350 --> 00:15:48,025
the lady who raised him.

171
00:15:49,390 --> 00:15:51,108
He only has me,

172
00:15:51,310 --> 00:15:53,141
and you will see,

173
00:15:53,390 --> 00:15:56,143
he is very handsome.

174
00:15:57,390 --> 00:15:59,301
I will see nothing at all.

175
00:15:59,470 --> 00:16:00,619
But Mother...

176
00:16:01,070 --> 00:16:03,061
Go upstairs to the apartment.

177
00:16:03,310 --> 00:16:08,145
It is time to fix lunch.

178
00:16:29,990 --> 00:16:30,945
Geneviéve!

179
00:16:32,270 --> 00:16:33,339
We are ruined!

180
00:16:34,110 --> 00:16:35,862
You always exaggerate.

181
00:16:36,310 --> 00:16:39,939
80 000 francs I have to pay
before the 15th. Is that funny?

182
00:16:40,430 --> 00:16:42,182
And if you don´t pay?

183
00:16:42,550 --> 00:16:44,222
They will seize our property.

184
00:16:44,390 --> 00:16:45,584
I will get a job.

185
00:16:45,750 --> 00:16:46,739
What sort of a job?

186
00:16:46,910 --> 00:16:48,468
Anything.

187
00:16:48,750 --> 00:16:50,661
Post Office or City Hall?

188
00:16:50,830 --> 00:16:52,309
Why not?

189
00:16:56,990 --> 00:17:00,983
You understand,
if I get married,

190
00:17:01,150 --> 00:17:05,063
Guy and I will work,
and we will help you.

191
00:17:05,310 --> 00:17:07,062
But, my littIe girl,

192
00:17:07,310 --> 00:17:10,347
it is out of the question
for you to marry.

193
00:17:10,510 --> 00:17:13,070
Take that away.
You´re in my way.

194
00:17:15,550 --> 00:17:17,586
Anyway,
what can he do?

195
00:17:17,750 --> 00:17:21,060
Can he support you?
Raise children?

196
00:17:21,790 --> 00:17:24,782
He´s not rich.
We will live modestly,

197
00:17:24,950 --> 00:17:28,022
and we won´t have
children right away.

198
00:17:28,910 --> 00:17:30,662
No, but one at least.

199
00:17:31,990 --> 00:17:35,221
He is not the one
who will pay my taxes.

200
00:17:35,390 --> 00:17:38,063
There isn´t a penny left
in the till.

201
00:17:38,230 --> 00:17:39,982
Sell your jewels.

202
00:17:40,150 --> 00:17:41,060
My jewels, never!

203
00:17:41,230 --> 00:17:43,346
What good are they?
You don´t even look at them.

204
00:17:43,510 --> 00:17:45,580
What if there´s
an emergency?

205
00:17:46,150 --> 00:17:49,745
What is happening,
isn´t it an emergency?

206
00:17:50,310 --> 00:17:53,905
Impossible! If I´d sell
my jewels, I´d feel...

207
00:17:54,310 --> 00:17:57,780
stripped and naked.

208
00:17:58,190 --> 00:17:59,703
Find something else.

209
00:17:59,870 --> 00:18:02,020
Something else?
We have nothing.

210
00:18:02,310 --> 00:18:04,346
Then, sell the shop.

211
00:18:04,510 --> 00:18:06,660
Stupid!
What will we live on?

212
00:18:06,830 --> 00:18:09,583
After all, a jewel is just a jewel.

213
00:18:14,430 --> 00:18:15,863
Should I change
my hair style?

214
00:18:18,470 --> 00:18:20,142
My engagement ring...

215
00:18:22,550 --> 00:18:24,142
It´s atrocious.

216
00:18:26,630 --> 00:18:27,983
This bracelet...

217
00:18:30,510 --> 00:18:32,421
I could never wear it.

218
00:18:35,070 --> 00:18:36,981
Nobody will want that.

219
00:18:38,510 --> 00:18:40,182
And your necklace?

220
00:18:40,350 --> 00:18:41,942
My necklace, you think?

221
00:18:42,350 --> 00:18:45,547
That´d be a crime.
No, I´ll never part with it.

222
00:18:46,310 --> 00:18:48,665
Anyway, it´s probably fake.

223
00:18:48,830 --> 00:18:52,664
Come on! After all,
it´s not that pretty.

224
00:18:54,390 --> 00:18:57,985
This afternoon,
we will go to Mr. Dubourg.

225
00:18:58,150 --> 00:19:01,460
Then I´ll have my hair done.

226
00:19:15,110 --> 00:19:16,987
How beautiful!

227
00:19:17,710 --> 00:19:19,701
Truly marvelous.

228
00:19:19,950 --> 00:19:21,099
Isn´t it?

229
00:19:21,510 --> 00:19:24,183
This is a mighty stone...

230
00:19:25,510 --> 00:19:27,705
if I may say so...

231
00:19:31,030 --> 00:19:32,748
Here are

232
00:19:33,470 --> 00:19:36,906
rubies, sapphires, emeralds.

233
00:19:37,430 --> 00:19:39,864
Ali Baba´s cave.

234
00:19:41,350 --> 00:19:43,705
The jewels...

235
00:19:43,870 --> 00:19:46,942
of Sleeping Beauty.

236
00:19:47,670 --> 00:19:51,265
Hello, Mrs. Emery.
Hello, Miss Geneviéve.

237
00:19:53,190 --> 00:19:56,102
Hello, Mr. Dubourg.

238
00:19:56,630 --> 00:19:57,858
Allow me...

239
00:19:58,030 --> 00:19:59,702
Please.

240
00:20:00,590 --> 00:20:03,229
The young miss...

241
00:20:04,710 --> 00:20:07,941
has become very pretty.

242
00:20:08,830 --> 00:20:10,821
It´s been such a long time...

243
00:20:12,590 --> 00:20:15,024
since I had the pleasure...

244
00:20:15,950 --> 00:20:18,783
But what can I do for you?

245
00:20:19,750 --> 00:20:22,947
You may speak frankly.

246
00:20:23,830 --> 00:20:27,664
We are in
an embarrassing situation.

247
00:20:28,150 --> 00:20:31,142
Geneviéve helps me
as much as she can.

248
00:20:31,750 --> 00:20:33,308
It has nothing to do with her.

249
00:20:33,750 --> 00:20:36,059
But I have heavy expenses
and I thought...

250
00:20:36,470 --> 00:20:39,303
Well...
I have a payment to meet

251
00:20:39,470 --> 00:20:42,621
and if I don´t,
consequences will be dire.

252
00:20:42,830 --> 00:20:46,061
So I come to you
as to my savior...

253
00:20:48,830 --> 00:20:51,390
I hesitated a long time,
and Geneviéve,

254
00:20:51,550 --> 00:20:54,064
who is the voice
of wisdom and reason,

255
00:20:54,390 --> 00:20:55,823
persuaded me...

256
00:20:56,630 --> 00:20:58,143
It breaks my heart

257
00:20:58,310 --> 00:21:01,302
to be forced to give up

258
00:21:01,470 --> 00:21:04,462
this jewel, which to me
represents...

259
00:21:07,630 --> 00:21:09,666
I understand, dear Madame,

260
00:21:09,830 --> 00:21:12,060
but my business is risky

261
00:21:12,230 --> 00:21:14,061
and I take many risks...

262
00:21:14,230 --> 00:21:17,381
At best, I can put
your necklace up for sale,

263
00:21:17,550 --> 00:21:22,544
but for much less
than its real worth.

264
00:21:24,270 --> 00:21:27,626
I cannot buy it myself.

265
00:21:28,430 --> 00:21:31,502
Couldn´t you at least
give me an advance?

266
00:21:31,710 --> 00:21:35,020
Nothing, I told you.
We can do nothing.

267
00:21:43,510 --> 00:21:45,228
Don´t insist, Mother.

268
00:21:47,190 --> 00:21:48,862
This is a disaster.

269
00:21:50,590 --> 00:21:55,505
Excuse me, I am interested.
I will buy this jewel.

270
00:21:56,270 --> 00:21:58,784
I can save you
from your predicament.

271
00:21:59,430 --> 00:22:01,705
Allow me to introduce myself.

272
00:22:01,950 --> 00:22:05,943
Roland Cassard,
diamond dealer.

273
00:22:06,110 --> 00:22:07,259
But, Sir...

274
00:22:07,430 --> 00:22:09,261
Do not worry, Madame,

275
00:22:10,710 --> 00:22:13,178
I am not a philanthropist.

276
00:22:14,310 --> 00:22:17,746
I´ll easily sell this necklace

277
00:22:18,070 --> 00:22:21,221
in Paris or London,

278
00:22:21,390 --> 00:22:24,143
where I often go on business.

279
00:22:25,070 --> 00:22:27,823
I don´t know if I shouId...

280
00:22:28,830 --> 00:22:30,741
Take me seriously.

281
00:22:32,310 --> 00:22:35,746
I am ashamed,
as well as delighted.

282
00:22:35,990 --> 00:22:38,743
I do not have enough cash with me.

283
00:22:39,550 --> 00:22:41,302
I can give you a check.

284
00:22:41,470 --> 00:22:42,903
There´s no hurry.

285
00:22:43,070 --> 00:22:45,220
Could you come tomorrow

286
00:22:45,870 --> 00:22:48,589
to my shop,

287
00:22:49,190 --> 00:22:52,262
„The Umbrellas of Cherbourg“...

288
00:22:53,270 --> 00:22:56,182
I´m always there.

289
00:22:57,430 --> 00:22:59,500
See you tomorrow.

290
00:23:16,270 --> 00:23:17,942
What time is it?

291
00:23:18,630 --> 00:23:20,222
6:15.

292
00:23:20,550 --> 00:23:23,542
How come he isn´t here yet?

293
00:23:23,750 --> 00:23:25,627
He might be a crook.

294
00:23:26,230 --> 00:23:28,061
He could have been leading you on.

295
00:23:28,630 --> 00:23:29,983
Don´t imagine things.

296
00:23:30,150 --> 00:23:31,902
What´s the matter with you?

297
00:23:32,070 --> 00:23:33,549
Nothing, Mother.

298
00:23:33,990 --> 00:23:35,742
Then, be quiet.

299
00:23:37,910 --> 00:23:39,707
I´m going to see Guy.

300
00:23:40,070 --> 00:23:43,745
I forbid you to see that boy.
Stay here.

301
00:23:43,910 --> 00:23:46,549
I wouldn´t want
to show you disrespect.

302
00:23:47,150 --> 00:23:48,742
Well, that´s good!

303
00:23:48,910 --> 00:23:49,865
But I´ll go.

304
00:23:50,030 --> 00:23:51,224
You´ll stay here.

305
00:23:54,990 --> 00:23:57,584
Anyway, Mr. Cassard
will be here soon,

306
00:23:57,750 --> 00:24:00,310
and I want you to be present.

307
00:24:00,470 --> 00:24:01,266
Why?

308
00:24:01,430 --> 00:24:02,499
Because!

309
00:24:02,910 --> 00:24:07,301
If he´s a crook, as you said,
we´d better face him together.

310
00:24:07,470 --> 00:24:10,223
You think we´ll be smart enough?

311
00:24:10,750 --> 00:24:12,980
I don´t know, but stay here.

312
00:24:13,150 --> 00:24:14,663
I cannot.

313
00:24:14,830 --> 00:24:18,948
Don´t leave. I don´t want you
to leave. Geneviéve!

314
00:24:34,950 --> 00:24:36,542
I had given up waiting for you.

315
00:24:36,710 --> 00:24:37,984
Are you crying?

316
00:24:38,150 --> 00:24:41,665
It´s nothing. Sometimes
I don´t have the courage

317
00:24:41,830 --> 00:24:45,106
to deal with my troubles,
with my debts.

318
00:24:45,710 --> 00:24:48,019
Am I not here to help you?

319
00:24:48,590 --> 00:24:50,342
It´s most kind of you.

320
00:24:51,550 --> 00:24:54,462
I´ve just seen Miss Geneviéve...

321
00:24:54,910 --> 00:24:56,229
I would have liked...

322
00:24:56,630 --> 00:24:57,949
She´s gone out.

323
00:24:58,110 --> 00:25:01,944
The life we lead
is so sad for a young girl...

324
00:25:02,110 --> 00:25:03,862
This dreary shop...

325
00:25:05,430 --> 00:25:07,307
I no longer amuse her...

326
00:25:07,470 --> 00:25:11,099
and I fear
she´ll become depressed.

327
00:25:11,270 --> 00:25:13,067
You see, she is bored.

328
00:25:16,750 --> 00:25:18,422
Would you like some tea?

329
00:25:19,190 --> 00:25:20,589
With pleasure.

330
00:25:24,350 --> 00:25:27,103
We´ve just had a terrible fight
about you.

331
00:25:27,270 --> 00:25:28,498
About me?

332
00:25:28,790 --> 00:25:31,099
She wanted to go out,
I didn´t want her to.

333
00:25:31,270 --> 00:25:35,502
We had a row. We are so lonely
since my husband died.

334
00:25:35,670 --> 00:25:37,103
Maybe you should...

335
00:25:37,870 --> 00:25:40,464
I don´t know...
take her to a show.

336
00:25:40,790 --> 00:25:41,939
Maybe.

337
00:25:48,630 --> 00:25:50,586
Will you come to dinner tomorrow?

338
00:25:51,110 --> 00:25:53,544
Geneviéve would be happy
to see you.

339
00:25:54,710 --> 00:25:58,020
Impossible, I must leave tonight.

340
00:25:59,430 --> 00:26:03,105
I´m going back to Paris,
and tomorrow I´m off to London.

341
00:26:03,870 --> 00:26:06,623
Here´s the money I promised you.

342
00:26:07,590 --> 00:26:10,946
Give Geneviéve my best regards,

343
00:26:11,350 --> 00:26:13,784
and I shall not fail

344
00:26:14,710 --> 00:26:17,429
to visit you

345
00:26:18,710 --> 00:26:22,305
on my next trip.

346
00:26:46,110 --> 00:26:49,102
I was so afraid
I wouldn´t find you.

347
00:26:49,510 --> 00:26:52,707
I am so happy to be with you!

348
00:26:53,870 --> 00:26:57,021
Now I´m laughing
because I realize

349
00:26:57,350 --> 00:27:00,865
how foolish I am
when I am alone.

350
00:27:02,110 --> 00:27:05,261
I talked to Mother
about our marriage.

351
00:27:06,110 --> 00:27:08,783
Of course, she said I´m crazy.

352
00:27:08,950 --> 00:27:13,262
And, tonight,
she forbade me to see you.

353
00:27:14,550 --> 00:27:17,906
You see, I was so afraid...

354
00:27:20,070 --> 00:27:24,541
I´d go anywhere,
I´d never see Mother again,

355
00:27:25,390 --> 00:27:27,460
rather than lose you.

356
00:27:32,310 --> 00:27:35,746
We´ll marry secretly.

357
00:27:37,750 --> 00:27:41,220
Now it does not matter
anymore.

358
00:27:41,390 --> 00:27:44,063
We have plenty of time.

359
00:27:45,470 --> 00:27:49,304
This morning,
I received my draft notice,

360
00:27:49,630 --> 00:27:52,747
and I will be away
for two years.

361
00:27:55,150 --> 00:27:58,586
So the marriage,
we´ll talk about it later...

362
00:27:59,550 --> 00:28:02,986
With the war in Algeria,

363
00:28:03,750 --> 00:28:07,902
it will be a long time
before I can come back.

364
00:28:13,670 --> 00:28:18,107
But I´ll never be able

365
00:28:18,310 --> 00:28:20,983
to live without you.

366
00:28:21,550 --> 00:28:24,622
I won´t be able to.

367
00:28:24,990 --> 00:28:28,300
Don´t go.
I will die.

368
00:28:28,830 --> 00:28:31,583
I will hide you...

369
00:28:32,310 --> 00:28:35,746
and I will have you,

370
00:28:36,310 --> 00:28:41,304
but, my love,
do not leave me.

371
00:28:44,430 --> 00:28:49,823
You know it is not possible.

372
00:28:49,990 --> 00:28:53,665
I will not leave you.

373
00:28:54,310 --> 00:28:58,622
My love,
I have to go.

374
00:28:59,390 --> 00:29:02,462
I want you to know

375
00:29:02,910 --> 00:29:06,300
that I think only of you.

376
00:29:06,990 --> 00:29:12,064
And I know
that you will wait for me.

377
00:29:16,470 --> 00:29:21,305
Two years...
Two years of our life!

378
00:29:24,670 --> 00:29:28,424
Don´t cry,
I beg you.

379
00:29:32,150 --> 00:29:36,143
Two years...
No, I can´t face it.

380
00:29:37,350 --> 00:29:40,148
Calm down,
we have so little time left.

381
00:29:41,030 --> 00:29:44,340
So little time, my love,
we mustn´t waste it.

382
00:29:48,510 --> 00:29:51,980
We must try to be happy.

383
00:29:52,590 --> 00:29:57,744
Of our last moments
we must keep a memory

384
00:29:57,950 --> 00:29:59,747
more beautiful
than anything.

385
00:30:00,470 --> 00:30:05,385
A memory which will help us
to live.

386
00:30:05,910 --> 00:30:11,507
I am so afraid
when I am alone.

387
00:30:11,910 --> 00:30:15,061
We´ll be together again
and we´ll be stronger.

388
00:30:16,190 --> 00:30:18,545
You will meet other women...

389
00:30:18,830 --> 00:30:21,583
you´ll forget me.

390
00:30:22,150 --> 00:30:24,584
I will love you

391
00:30:25,150 --> 00:30:29,382
until the end of my life.

392
00:30:30,750 --> 00:30:32,661
Guy, I love you.

393
00:30:32,830 --> 00:30:35,902
Do not leave me.

394
00:30:45,510 --> 00:30:49,503
My love, do not leave me.

395
00:30:56,990 --> 00:31:01,620
Come, my love, my love.

396
00:31:26,870 --> 00:31:28,269
Is that you, Guy?

397
00:31:29,590 --> 00:31:33,060
Good evening, Aunt Elise.
Are you in bed?

398
00:31:35,470 --> 00:31:37,700
I don´t feel too well.

399
00:31:45,510 --> 00:31:47,705
Is there anything you want?

400
00:31:48,590 --> 00:31:53,027
Nothing.
I just need to rest.

401
00:31:54,990 --> 00:31:58,187
Good night, my little one.

402
00:32:14,910 --> 00:32:16,389
I am afraid...

403
00:32:21,590 --> 00:32:22,818
I love you.

404
00:32:42,590 --> 00:32:43,943
Where were you?

405
00:32:44,790 --> 00:32:46,018
With Guy.

406
00:32:51,030 --> 00:32:52,258
What did you do?

407
00:33:05,310 --> 00:33:09,223
He is leaving.
He´ll be away two years.

408
00:33:10,230 --> 00:33:14,542
I can´t live without him.
I will die.

409
00:33:15,190 --> 00:33:19,024
Stop crying.
Look at me.

410
00:33:19,950 --> 00:33:22,703
People only die of love
in movies.

411
00:33:22,950 --> 00:33:25,783
It´s too cruel...

412
00:33:30,350 --> 00:33:33,706
Separation is cruel,
that´s true.

413
00:33:34,710 --> 00:33:38,703
But time fixes a lot of things.

414
00:33:39,510 --> 00:33:43,503
You talk about love,
what do you know of love?

415
00:33:44,510 --> 00:33:48,105
Are you sure of your feelings?

416
00:33:49,230 --> 00:33:53,906
Mother, can´t you see
how unhappy I am?

417
00:33:56,590 --> 00:33:59,423
I know, darling, I know.

418
00:33:59,750 --> 00:34:02,867
I have also
loved, fought...

419
00:34:03,830 --> 00:34:06,549
and I have suffered.
You should listen to me.

420
00:34:06,710 --> 00:34:07,984
I do listen to you.

421
00:34:08,150 --> 00:34:11,062
Isn´t it better to wait?

422
00:34:12,310 --> 00:34:17,464
Two years from now, perhaps
you will have forgotten Guy.

423
00:34:18,830 --> 00:34:23,620
Never... will I forget him.

424
00:34:24,150 --> 00:34:27,825
If you still love him
when he returns, you´ll see.

425
00:34:28,470 --> 00:34:32,145
You must believe me.
You must calm down

426
00:34:32,990 --> 00:34:35,629
and get this affair
out of your mind.

427
00:34:38,550 --> 00:34:40,063
Have you had dinner?

428
00:34:40,750 --> 00:34:42,069
Yes, Mother.

429
00:34:44,150 --> 00:34:45,708
Eat a fruit.

430
00:34:47,910 --> 00:34:51,869
You need distraction.
Go out and live a little.

431
00:34:52,110 --> 00:34:54,385
It is not difficult.

432
00:35:01,230 --> 00:35:04,666
You are young, pretty and witty...

433
00:35:05,070 --> 00:35:08,904
You will make friends
your age, or oIder.

434
00:35:09,070 --> 00:35:12,665
Mr. Cassard
came this evening.

435
00:35:13,070 --> 00:35:15,630
He was sorry he missed you.

436
00:35:15,910 --> 00:35:19,459
I am certain he could give you
good advice.

437
00:35:20,150 --> 00:35:23,984
I can do without his advice.

438
00:35:24,310 --> 00:35:27,825
You are wrong!
For me, he is the kind of man...

439
00:35:27,990 --> 00:35:30,140
Don´t bore me with his kind!

440
00:35:32,470 --> 00:35:34,540
You look terrible.

441
00:35:35,230 --> 00:35:36,982
Leave me alone, Mother.

442
00:35:37,310 --> 00:35:41,622
Give me a kiss at least.
Have faith. You will see.

443
00:35:57,470 --> 00:36:00,826
Look at me, my boy.

444
00:36:01,390 --> 00:36:04,621
When you return,
I do not know

445
00:36:04,790 --> 00:36:08,783
if I shall still be alive.

446
00:36:09,030 --> 00:36:11,544
But, Elise!...

447
00:36:11,710 --> 00:36:15,180
Do not say „but“.
I´ve had a good life,

448
00:36:15,350 --> 00:36:18,865
and I can leave it
without regrets.

449
00:36:19,230 --> 00:36:22,142
Nonsense!
Right, Madeleine?

450
00:36:23,390 --> 00:36:26,621
Of course!
She´s better already.

451
00:36:26,830 --> 00:36:30,539
I´ll meet death before you do.

452
00:36:31,790 --> 00:36:34,907
It´s the army,
not the war.

453
00:36:35,830 --> 00:36:39,220
Before you go,
I want you to know

454
00:36:39,390 --> 00:36:42,860
that everything I have
will be yours.

455
00:36:43,270 --> 00:36:45,943
Don´t ever forget me.

456
00:36:46,110 --> 00:36:49,705
Write me from time to time.

457
00:36:50,190 --> 00:36:53,944
MadeIeine will keep you informed.

458
00:36:54,870 --> 00:36:57,942
Farewell, my little one.

459
00:37:53,870 --> 00:37:58,785
My love,
I will wait for you,

460
00:37:59,070 --> 00:38:02,221
all my life.

461
00:38:02,390 --> 00:38:04,585
I will think only of you.

462
00:38:04,750 --> 00:38:07,184
Stay, do not go,

463
00:38:07,350 --> 00:38:10,308
I beg you.

464
00:38:11,030 --> 00:38:14,818
Stay, my love.

465
00:38:15,230 --> 00:38:19,303
It is not time yet.

466
00:38:19,470 --> 00:38:22,746
I am going away from you,

467
00:38:22,910 --> 00:38:26,539
do not look at me.

468
00:38:36,470 --> 00:38:38,700
I cannot.

469
00:38:40,230 --> 00:38:42,107
I cannot.

470
00:40:05,390 --> 00:40:10,145
SECOND PART: THE ABSENCE

471
00:40:30,150 --> 00:40:31,185
So?

472
00:40:31,510 --> 00:40:32,659
So, what?

473
00:40:33,390 --> 00:40:35,142
You are so pale.

474
00:40:39,590 --> 00:40:41,820
What did the doctor say?

475
00:40:42,830 --> 00:40:47,585
Almost nothing...
I need a rest.

476
00:40:49,390 --> 00:40:53,099
You didn´t need
to see a doctor for that.

477
00:40:53,270 --> 00:40:57,866
I could have told you myself.
What else?

478
00:40:58,150 --> 00:41:01,062
He gave me a prescription.

479
00:41:01,390 --> 00:41:04,188
Sedatives, tonics, things.

480
00:41:04,950 --> 00:41:09,102
Things!
Then it can´t be very serious.

481
00:41:09,270 --> 00:41:12,228
You see, Geneviéve,
if the shop was doing better,

482
00:41:12,390 --> 00:41:15,268
I would be the happiest woman.

483
00:41:18,190 --> 00:41:20,340
It´s freezing.

484
00:41:22,670 --> 00:41:26,345
Do you know
whom I met in town?

485
00:41:26,710 --> 00:41:29,588
You´ll never guess.
Roland Cassard!

486
00:41:29,790 --> 00:41:31,109
What do you say?

487
00:41:31,270 --> 00:41:33,864
What do you want me to say?

488
00:41:34,030 --> 00:41:36,021
He is incredibly nice.

489
00:41:36,190 --> 00:41:39,182
We talked for more than an hour
this morning.

490
00:41:39,350 --> 00:41:42,342
He´s back from the U.S.A.
What a man!

491
00:41:42,550 --> 00:41:46,668
He told me a thousand stories.
I invited him to dinner.

492
00:41:54,030 --> 00:41:55,588
What´s the matter, Geneviéve?

493
00:41:55,750 --> 00:41:58,503
Nothing, I´m just tired.

494
00:42:00,110 --> 00:42:03,261
That´s no reason
for sulking like that.

495
00:42:03,430 --> 00:42:06,228
You may be weary,
but you´re not dying.

496
00:42:06,390 --> 00:42:10,861
It´s not my weariness
that saddens me, it´s his silence.

497
00:42:11,030 --> 00:42:13,988
Guy left two months ago.

498
00:42:14,150 --> 00:42:15,947
He only wrote me once.

499
00:42:16,110 --> 00:42:18,499
Don´t start that again!

500
00:42:18,990 --> 00:42:22,426
If I knew where he was
I could write him.

501
00:42:23,790 --> 00:42:27,749
They´ve sent him, I´m sure,
to a dangerous place

502
00:42:27,910 --> 00:42:29,582
where he´s risking his life.

503
00:42:29,870 --> 00:42:31,189
It´s more simple.

504
00:42:31,350 --> 00:42:32,863
More simple than what?

505
00:42:33,070 --> 00:42:34,219
He´s forgotten you.

506
00:42:34,390 --> 00:42:36,142
You don´t know
what you´re saying!

507
00:42:36,470 --> 00:42:39,223
He doesn´t think about you.
If he did, he would write.

508
00:42:39,510 --> 00:42:42,661
One can write,
however far one is.

509
00:42:48,630 --> 00:42:53,863
It´s nothing.
I was so scared.

510
00:42:54,030 --> 00:42:55,668
I suddenly saw Guy

511
00:42:55,830 --> 00:42:59,027
laughing with another woman.

512
00:43:01,230 --> 00:43:06,304
Sit down.
I´ll close the shop.

513
00:43:14,470 --> 00:43:16,426
You´re hiding something.

514
00:43:16,790 --> 00:43:18,109
I´m not.

515
00:43:19,590 --> 00:43:22,388
It is serious, isn´t it?

516
00:43:25,430 --> 00:43:29,343
I´m pregnant, Mother.

517
00:43:29,510 --> 00:43:32,786
This is horrible,
pregnant by Guy?

518
00:43:33,350 --> 00:43:35,545
How is it possible?

519
00:43:35,710 --> 00:43:39,100
WeII, just like everybody.

520
00:43:39,270 --> 00:43:41,909
Don´t joke about it,
it is serious.

521
00:43:42,230 --> 00:43:44,186
What are we going to do?

522
00:43:44,550 --> 00:43:46,745
What do you mean?

523
00:43:47,830 --> 00:43:49,024
With the child?

524
00:43:49,190 --> 00:43:50,259
Bring it up.

525
00:43:50,510 --> 00:43:51,659
What shall we say?

526
00:43:51,830 --> 00:43:53,388
To whom?

527
00:43:53,550 --> 00:43:56,508
I don´t know...
our neighbors, our friends!

528
00:43:56,670 --> 00:43:59,025
We have no friends.

529
00:43:59,190 --> 00:44:02,500
And the neighbors,
you never speak to them.

530
00:44:03,790 --> 00:44:06,384
Roland Cassard
is coming to dinner.

531
00:44:07,030 --> 00:44:10,625
We´ll have to treat him well.
We´ll have to put up a good front.

532
00:44:10,790 --> 00:44:13,748
The way you look...
pregnant...

533
00:44:13,910 --> 00:44:15,946
You don´t need to tell him.

534
00:44:16,110 --> 00:44:19,147
Shut up.
It makes me...

535
00:44:20,030 --> 00:44:22,703
shiver
just to think of it.

536
00:44:23,150 --> 00:44:26,426
Go upstairs and lie down.

537
00:44:28,590 --> 00:44:31,184
I feel very well.

538
00:44:32,110 --> 00:44:35,147
Don´t argue. Obey me.

539
00:44:39,870 --> 00:44:44,546
I will cook dinner myseIf.
Do not worry...

540
00:45:13,310 --> 00:45:16,939
Maybe you need some rest...

541
00:45:17,110 --> 00:45:21,103
Geneviéve has been
overdoing it somewhat

542
00:45:21,550 --> 00:45:22,619
lateIy.

543
00:45:22,990 --> 00:45:24,582
She´s a bit pale.

544
00:45:25,230 --> 00:45:28,984
Why wouldn´t you go
live in the country?

545
00:45:29,870 --> 00:45:34,341
The situation in which
we find ourselves

546
00:45:34,510 --> 00:45:38,025
is such that we cannot,
for the time being,

547
00:45:38,190 --> 00:45:40,750
take any rest.

548
00:45:41,070 --> 00:45:43,982
Geneviéve wouldn´t go alone,

549
00:45:44,150 --> 00:45:48,746
and I cannot leave the shop.

550
00:45:49,470 --> 00:45:51,188
There´s no way out of it.

551
00:45:51,430 --> 00:45:55,628
So you can´t be separated?

552
00:45:56,350 --> 00:46:00,946
We´ve practically never
been parted...

553
00:46:02,630 --> 00:46:05,144
I haven´t found the bean.

554
00:46:05,310 --> 00:46:07,744
I have it.

555
00:46:08,070 --> 00:46:13,269
You must pick a king
and make a wish.

556
00:46:13,430 --> 00:46:15,785
I have no choice.

557
00:46:17,270 --> 00:46:19,420
You are my king.

558
00:46:19,670 --> 00:46:21,262
Thank you, Geneviéve.

559
00:46:21,430 --> 00:46:23,944
Put this crown on.

560
00:46:25,270 --> 00:46:29,229
Put it on, Geneviéve,
since you´re asked to.

561
00:46:41,390 --> 00:46:43,858
You look like

562
00:46:44,030 --> 00:46:47,909
a „Virgin with child“
I saw in Antwerp.

563
00:46:51,830 --> 00:46:54,503
My cheeks are burning.

564
00:46:54,670 --> 00:46:58,140
How amusing!
I think I drank too much.

565
00:47:03,790 --> 00:47:07,863
I´ll leave you now.
I´m not feeIing too well.

566
00:47:08,070 --> 00:47:10,220
Then I´ll go.

567
00:47:10,390 --> 00:47:15,623
Please.
Let´s chat a little more.

568
00:47:22,350 --> 00:47:25,308
Goodnight, my darling.

569
00:47:37,110 --> 00:47:40,466
I´m really worried.
Geneviéve is sad,

570
00:47:40,630 --> 00:47:42,541
secretive, independent.

571
00:47:42,710 --> 00:47:46,703
And I admit I may not be adroit
and understanding enough.

572
00:47:46,870 --> 00:47:49,430
I´m always afraid
to hurt her.

573
00:47:49,590 --> 00:47:52,343
I wouldn´t want
to sound ridiculous,

574
00:47:52,510 --> 00:47:56,549
and my feelings
could seem insincere,

575
00:47:56,990 --> 00:47:58,105
however...

576
00:47:58,430 --> 00:48:02,218
although I am taking this step,
I wouldn´t want

577
00:48:02,390 --> 00:48:04,267
to give the wrong impression.

578
00:48:04,430 --> 00:48:09,743
My only desire
is to give happiness...

579
00:48:11,470 --> 00:48:14,064
Am I making myself clear?

580
00:48:14,230 --> 00:48:17,620
In fact, not really.

581
00:48:26,750 --> 00:48:29,139
Since the beginning of dinner,

582
00:48:29,310 --> 00:48:33,189
I have tried to broach a subject
which preoccupies me

583
00:48:33,350 --> 00:48:37,263
but I am as moved as I am shy.

584
00:48:37,950 --> 00:48:41,101
I came to ask you to give me
Geneviéve´s hand.

585
00:48:41,950 --> 00:48:44,145
I am quite awkward, I know.

586
00:48:44,310 --> 00:48:47,905
You are not,
but this is quite unexpected.

587
00:48:48,470 --> 00:48:51,621
Geneviéve for me
is still a child...

588
00:48:51,870 --> 00:48:55,909
and your abrupt request
is somewhat unsettling.

589
00:48:56,910 --> 00:49:01,426
You see, I don´t know
Geneviéve´s feelings for you...

590
00:49:02,430 --> 00:49:06,184
She only talked about you
as a friend.

591
00:49:06,710 --> 00:49:11,738
I wouldn´t want, in any way,
to put pressure on her.

592
00:49:12,830 --> 00:49:17,824
We know nothing about you...

593
00:49:21,110 --> 00:49:26,343
Long ago,
I loved a woman.

594
00:49:27,790 --> 00:49:30,543
She didn´t love me.

595
00:49:31,630 --> 00:49:33,780
Her name was Lola.

596
00:49:33,950 --> 00:49:36,418
Long ago.

597
00:49:37,430 --> 00:49:41,582
Disappointed,
I tried to forget her.

598
00:49:42,990 --> 00:49:46,027
So, I left France...

599
00:49:46,750 --> 00:49:51,505
I went to the end of the world...

600
00:49:54,550 --> 00:49:57,940
I had no more taste for life.

601
00:49:58,550 --> 00:50:01,701
Then, by chance,

602
00:50:02,190 --> 00:50:05,705
our paths crossed.

603
00:50:09,870 --> 00:50:13,180
As soon as I saw Geneviéve,

604
00:50:13,710 --> 00:50:16,668
I knew that I had been
waiting for her.

605
00:50:17,550 --> 00:50:23,864
Since I met her,
life has a new meaning.

606
00:50:25,030 --> 00:50:28,420
All the time,
she´s in front of my eyes.

607
00:50:28,990 --> 00:50:32,744
I live only for her...

608
00:50:32,910 --> 00:50:35,902
I think only of her...

609
00:50:36,070 --> 00:50:39,107
I had to

610
00:50:40,470 --> 00:50:44,224
speak to you frankly.

611
00:50:44,550 --> 00:50:47,542
Don´t be offended.

612
00:50:48,310 --> 00:50:51,143
Of course, I wouldn´t think

613
00:50:51,310 --> 00:50:54,859
of influencing Geneviéve.

614
00:50:55,230 --> 00:51:00,827
Geneviéve is free.

615
00:51:11,990 --> 00:51:15,744
Tomorrow, I go back
to Amsterdam for three months.

616
00:51:15,910 --> 00:51:21,143
When I return,
Geneviéve will give me her answer.

617
00:51:21,630 --> 00:51:24,781
I don´t know what to say.

618
00:51:25,230 --> 00:51:27,664
Do not say anything...

619
00:51:27,830 --> 00:51:31,869
Geneviéve will decide herself.

620
00:51:54,390 --> 00:51:55,345
You´re not sleeping?

621
00:51:55,510 --> 00:51:57,182
You can see that.

622
00:51:58,270 --> 00:52:01,660
Roland Cassard
asked me for your hand.

623
00:52:02,990 --> 00:52:05,504
I was listening.

624
00:52:05,990 --> 00:52:09,539
You didn´t tell him
that I´m pregnant?

625
00:52:09,910 --> 00:52:13,300
I did not dare tell him...

626
00:52:55,270 --> 00:52:57,943
<i>I am ver prood of you.</i>

627
00:52:58,110 --> 00:53:01,864
<i>François is a pretty name</i>
<i>for a boy...</i>

628
00:53:02,030 --> 00:53:03,941
<i>TIme passes slowly here.</i>

629
00:53:04,110 --> 00:53:07,147
<i>Forloghs have been sospended.</i>

630
00:53:07,310 --> 00:53:10,222
<i>And I don´t know</i>

631
00:53:10,750 --> 00:53:14,709
<i>whether I´ll come back</i>
<i>to France before long.</i>

632
00:53:14,990 --> 00:53:18,141
<i>My love,</i>
<i>I know you are waiting for me.</i>

633
00:53:19,950 --> 00:53:25,866
<i>Last night, one of our patrols</i>
<i>fell ino an ambosh.</i>

634
00:53:26,150 --> 00:53:28,061
<i>Three soldiers were killed.</i>

635
00:53:28,230 --> 00:53:30,425
<i>All the same,</i>
<i>I don´t think</i>

636
00:53:30,590 --> 00:53:34,105
<i>that there´s great danger here.</i>

637
00:53:35,150 --> 00:53:39,701
<i>Bot it is strange how</i>
<i>son and death</i>

638
00:53:40,190 --> 00:53:43,865
<i>travel together.</i>

639
00:53:48,750 --> 00:53:51,389
Geneviéve,
come to dinner, darling!

640
00:54:16,270 --> 00:54:18,420
<i>Dear Mr. Cassard,</i>

641
00:54:18,590 --> 00:54:21,980
<i>we greatly appreciated</i>
<i>your postcard,</i>

642
00:54:22,150 --> 00:54:24,789
<i>Mother and I.</i>

643
00:55:27,310 --> 00:55:29,699
I find these people ridiculous.

644
00:55:29,870 --> 00:55:31,747
I hate the carnival.

645
00:55:31,910 --> 00:55:34,344
Don´t be bitter, my darling.

646
00:55:36,030 --> 00:55:38,498
Incredible, how big you are!

647
00:55:38,910 --> 00:55:42,744
You are carrying in front,
it will be a boy, or twins.

648
00:55:43,030 --> 00:55:45,339
No, everything is normal.

649
00:55:45,790 --> 00:55:47,621
I am feeling wonderful.

650
00:55:47,790 --> 00:55:50,827
You´re like me.
I was delighted, never sick...

651
00:55:50,990 --> 00:55:54,107
the day before your birth,
I was up on a ladder,

652
00:55:54,270 --> 00:55:56,989
changing the wallpaper
in the shop.

653
00:55:59,190 --> 00:56:01,465
Has the postman come?

654
00:56:01,950 --> 00:56:04,544
There were only bills

655
00:56:05,070 --> 00:56:07,584
and some advertising.

656
00:56:07,950 --> 00:56:10,783
Why? Are you still waiting?

657
00:56:15,590 --> 00:56:17,865
In his last letter, he wrote

658
00:56:18,030 --> 00:56:21,545
that he was sad because
he wouldn´t see me pregnant.

659
00:56:22,310 --> 00:56:24,619
And perhaps it´s just as well.

660
00:56:24,790 --> 00:56:25,859
I Iook awful.

661
00:56:26,030 --> 00:56:27,258
A pregnant woman

662
00:56:27,430 --> 00:56:29,785
is always beautiful,
my darling.

663
00:56:32,670 --> 00:56:34,228
That´s true.

664
00:56:35,470 --> 00:56:36,823
Look at that.

665
00:56:37,350 --> 00:56:41,389
A vest. And I saw pretty rompers
at the department store.

666
00:56:41,950 --> 00:56:43,781
Admit that you are pleased.

667
00:56:43,950 --> 00:56:47,067
I´d be more pleased
if that child had a father,

668
00:56:47,230 --> 00:56:49,380
and if you had a husband.

669
00:56:50,390 --> 00:56:52,620
Guy will return.

670
00:56:54,110 --> 00:56:56,624
Guy or someone else...

671
00:56:58,150 --> 00:57:00,983
Absence is a funny thing...

672
00:57:02,990 --> 00:57:06,824
I feel that Guy left
years ago...

673
00:57:07,910 --> 00:57:09,502
I look at this photograph,

674
00:57:09,670 --> 00:57:12,503
and I forget
what he really looks like...

675
00:57:12,670 --> 00:57:16,185
And when I think of him,
it´s this photo that I see.

676
00:57:16,870 --> 00:57:20,704
It´s all that I´ve got left of him.

677
00:57:30,270 --> 00:57:32,704
Do not smoke.
Be reasonable.

678
00:57:42,670 --> 00:57:43,989
What´s that?

679
00:57:44,150 --> 00:57:46,027
A postcard from Hamburg.

680
00:57:46,190 --> 00:57:48,067
It´s from Roland Cassard.

681
00:57:48,230 --> 00:57:48,980
For me?

682
00:57:49,150 --> 00:57:51,141
For us. You can read it.

683
00:57:51,910 --> 00:57:54,504
He says he´ll be back soon.

684
00:57:55,150 --> 00:57:58,062
He asks
if you have thought it over.

685
00:57:58,430 --> 00:58:01,342
I feel that there´s no hurry.

686
00:58:01,750 --> 00:58:04,742
No, but you must think it over.

687
00:58:05,190 --> 00:58:07,624
I am thinking it over,
Mother, I am...

688
00:58:07,790 --> 00:58:10,782
Here´s a man,
rich, refined,

689
00:58:10,950 --> 00:58:13,305
and enamored of you,
and I think...

690
00:58:15,070 --> 00:58:16,822
What are you doing?

691
00:58:17,270 --> 00:58:19,022
You´re not feeling well?

692
00:58:19,190 --> 00:58:20,942
I´m all right, Mother.

693
00:58:21,110 --> 00:58:21,860
You are eating.

694
00:58:22,030 --> 00:58:24,464
I can´t help it,
I´m always hungry.

695
00:58:25,350 --> 00:58:29,229
He´s not a womanizer,
a smooth taIker on the prowl,

696
00:58:29,510 --> 00:58:33,389
but a man who has lived
and suffered.

697
00:58:34,190 --> 00:58:37,546
I know, Mother,
but don´t give me a sales talk.

698
00:58:37,870 --> 00:58:41,385
You praise him
as you praise your umbrellas.

699
00:58:41,830 --> 00:58:44,105
He´II protect you, Geneviéve.

700
00:58:44,270 --> 00:58:45,066
Very funny!

701
00:58:45,230 --> 00:58:48,745
If you can´t stand humor,
you are lost!

702
00:58:50,510 --> 00:58:53,900
Guy might have been
your ideal...

703
00:58:54,070 --> 00:58:56,345
but what future
did he offer you?

704
00:58:57,430 --> 00:59:00,581
You know, me too,
I was once wooed

705
00:59:00,750 --> 00:59:03,583
by a young man
who was not your father.

706
00:59:03,750 --> 00:59:06,503
You´d have done better
to marry him.

707
00:59:06,870 --> 00:59:08,542
You are right.

708
00:59:08,710 --> 00:59:11,668
But understand
that I want you to be happy,

709
00:59:11,830 --> 00:59:15,345
and not to ruin your life
as I ruined mine.

710
00:59:15,510 --> 00:59:18,502
Don´t worry about my life, Mother.

711
00:59:18,870 --> 00:59:22,226
I have no intention
whatsoever

712
00:59:22,430 --> 00:59:24,466
to waste my life.

713
00:59:26,750 --> 00:59:30,060
Do you think Cassard
will want to marry me

714
00:59:30,230 --> 00:59:32,790
when he sees that I have been
knocked up?

715
00:59:32,950 --> 00:59:34,349
Watch your language !

716
00:59:34,510 --> 00:59:36,068
Deformed! Bloated!

717
00:59:36,230 --> 00:59:39,506
Since neither you nor me
had the courage

718
00:59:39,670 --> 00:59:42,628
to confess the truth to him...

719
00:59:43,030 --> 00:59:46,102
Now, at Ieast, it will show!

720
00:59:50,550 --> 00:59:53,383
Do you beIieve
he´II take me Iike this?

721
00:59:53,550 --> 00:59:55,620
If he refuses me as I am,

722
00:59:55,790 --> 00:59:57,906
it means that he doesn´t have

723
00:59:58,070 --> 01:00:00,061
deep feeIings for me.

724
01:00:00,230 --> 01:00:03,427
If, by some unlikely chance,
he accepts me,

725
01:00:03,590 --> 01:00:06,502
I will have no reason
to doubt him,

726
01:00:06,670 --> 01:00:09,707
and I would be a fool
to reject him.

727
01:00:10,310 --> 01:00:13,063
So, you see,
I´m thinking it over.

728
01:00:13,230 --> 01:00:16,540
But all this is so difficult...

729
01:00:23,750 --> 01:00:28,540
Why is absence

730
01:00:28,750 --> 01:00:32,584
so heavy to bear?

731
01:00:35,590 --> 01:00:37,501
Why is Guy

732
01:00:37,670 --> 01:00:40,901
fading away from me?

733
01:00:43,350 --> 01:00:47,548
I would have died

734
01:00:48,110 --> 01:00:49,748
for him.

735
01:00:51,470 --> 01:00:56,942
Why am I not dead?

736
01:01:16,550 --> 01:01:17,426
Look!

737
01:01:17,630 --> 01:01:19,268
What is it?

738
01:01:19,430 --> 01:01:21,068
It´s for you.

739
01:01:21,750 --> 01:01:24,139
Roland sent it to you.

740
01:01:24,590 --> 01:01:27,423
I cannot accept it.

741
01:01:29,550 --> 01:01:31,666
Do as you like.

742
01:01:49,750 --> 01:01:53,345
We´ll bring up
this child together.

743
01:01:53,790 --> 01:01:56,748
He will be our child.

744
01:01:57,270 --> 01:01:59,909
Please agree to it,

745
01:02:00,630 --> 01:02:03,508
Geneviéve.

746
01:02:04,790 --> 01:02:07,588
I don´t want all this

747
01:02:08,710 --> 01:02:12,066
to upset you in the least.

748
01:02:13,030 --> 01:02:15,464
I love you,

749
01:02:16,030 --> 01:02:18,942
Geneviéve.

750
01:02:29,550 --> 01:02:31,108
She agrees,

751
01:02:31,270 --> 01:02:33,261
since the condition

752
01:02:33,470 --> 01:02:37,349
she´s in
does not frighten you.

753
01:02:37,510 --> 01:02:39,501
But don´t rush her.

754
01:02:39,670 --> 01:02:41,820
She is so fragile

755
01:02:42,030 --> 01:02:44,066
that the slightest mistake

756
01:02:44,270 --> 01:02:47,068
might compromise everything.

757
01:04:00,870 --> 01:04:05,660
THIRD PART: THE RETURN

758
01:04:54,230 --> 01:04:56,346
<i>New Owner</i>

759
01:04:59,350 --> 01:05:02,023
Madeleine told me everything.

760
01:05:02,470 --> 01:05:04,426
Why didn´t you say anything?

761
01:05:04,590 --> 01:05:06,148
I didn´t want to.

762
01:05:06,310 --> 01:05:08,983
I thought you knew.

763
01:05:09,790 --> 01:05:11,906
You didn´t suspect anything?

764
01:05:12,070 --> 01:05:14,982
Of course,
over the last few months,

765
01:05:16,070 --> 01:05:18,743
her letters were not the same.

766
01:05:19,350 --> 01:05:22,342
She did not answer my questions.

767
01:05:23,230 --> 01:05:25,824
She was writing
without conviction.

768
01:05:26,270 --> 01:05:29,865
But between that
and marrying another man!

769
01:05:30,630 --> 01:05:32,905
I thought she was mad at me,

770
01:05:33,070 --> 01:05:34,389
but I didn´t know what about.

771
01:05:34,550 --> 01:05:37,269
Then there was the hospital

772
01:05:37,950 --> 01:05:40,464
and my letters
unanswered.

773
01:05:44,310 --> 01:05:46,744
Here, nothing has changed.

774
01:05:46,990 --> 01:05:48,469
I have.

775
01:05:48,750 --> 01:05:51,218
I can let myseIf go

776
01:05:52,310 --> 01:05:53,868
now that you´re here.

777
01:05:54,030 --> 01:05:58,421
I would have been unhappy
not to see you again.

778
01:05:59,630 --> 01:06:01,541
Don´t talk nonsense.

779
01:06:01,790 --> 01:06:04,702
Come on, make yourself useful,
my boy.

780
01:06:05,430 --> 01:06:08,183
Give me some herb tea.

781
01:06:09,470 --> 01:06:11,188
Everything´s ready

782
01:06:11,510 --> 01:06:12,989
in the kitchen.

783
01:06:13,150 --> 01:06:16,426
There´s water
in the kettle.

784
01:06:18,510 --> 01:06:20,660
Does your leg hurt?

785
01:06:20,830 --> 01:06:23,424
You see, I limp a little.

786
01:06:27,470 --> 01:06:29,142
It´s like having

787
01:06:29,310 --> 01:06:32,188
a barometer in the knee...

788
01:06:32,870 --> 01:06:34,667
Especially when it rains.

789
01:06:34,830 --> 01:06:38,140
It was in the hospital
that I suffered the most.

790
01:06:38,950 --> 01:06:41,305
But how did it happen?

791
01:06:41,830 --> 01:06:45,186
Returning
one night from maneuvers.

792
01:06:45,390 --> 01:06:46,948
We were attacked...

793
01:06:47,550 --> 01:06:50,348
Hand grenades...
It happened often.

794
01:06:53,910 --> 01:06:55,104
And Madeleine?

795
01:06:55,270 --> 01:06:57,340
She´s coming.

796
01:06:57,510 --> 01:07:00,422
She´s been very good to me.

797
01:07:01,310 --> 01:07:04,063
She´s not married yet?

798
01:07:05,070 --> 01:07:07,425
You know how well-behaved she is.

799
01:07:12,070 --> 01:07:13,469
Put it over there,

800
01:07:13,630 --> 01:07:15,541
on the table.

801
01:07:19,670 --> 01:07:22,343
What will you do now?

802
01:07:24,030 --> 01:07:26,703
Work.
Or maybe live

803
01:07:27,350 --> 01:07:28,942
off of my pension.

804
01:07:29,110 --> 01:07:33,422
Aubin promised to take you back.

805
01:07:34,230 --> 01:07:36,027
You liked his gas station?

806
01:07:36,830 --> 01:07:39,663
That one or another one...

807
01:07:39,950 --> 01:07:43,181
We´ll see. I have time.
There´s no hurry.

808
01:07:48,310 --> 01:07:51,188
The child she was expecting...

809
01:07:51,750 --> 01:07:53,103
do you know anything about it?

810
01:07:53,350 --> 01:07:57,423
No. Geneviéve left
just after the wedding.

811
01:07:58,630 --> 01:08:00,985
Mrs Emery stayed

812
01:08:01,430 --> 01:08:04,263
in Cherbourg
a month or two...

813
01:08:05,230 --> 01:08:08,188
Then she sold the shop.

814
01:08:09,630 --> 01:08:12,542
I think they are in Paris.

815
01:08:24,150 --> 01:08:26,948
You haven´t changed.

816
01:08:27,350 --> 01:08:29,500
I´m happy

817
01:08:29,710 --> 01:08:33,419
that you have returned.

818
01:09:17,390 --> 01:09:18,709
Foucher!

819
01:09:21,150 --> 01:09:22,265
The boss wants you.

820
01:09:24,830 --> 01:09:25,580
Shit!

821
01:09:34,430 --> 01:09:36,819
Did you service
this gentIeman´s car?

822
01:09:38,510 --> 01:09:41,183
Complete check-up on the 26th,
right, sir?

823
01:09:42,870 --> 01:09:46,021
Two thrown rods this morning.
The engine is dead.

824
01:09:46,190 --> 01:09:48,067
A brand new engine.
Not one drop of oil!

825
01:09:48,830 --> 01:09:52,027
I´m not blaming anyone,
but that´s it. I´m real sorry.

826
01:09:52,270 --> 01:09:54,101
Did you check the oil gauge?

827
01:09:54,270 --> 01:09:55,146
Of course.

828
01:09:55,310 --> 01:09:56,868
You forgot to screw the cap on.

829
01:09:57,030 --> 01:09:58,258
I know my job.

830
01:09:58,470 --> 01:10:00,347
Don´t talk to me like that!

831
01:10:00,510 --> 01:10:02,023
And apologize to the gentleman.

832
01:10:02,510 --> 01:10:04,466
I don´t have to.
It´s not my fault.

833
01:10:04,790 --> 01:10:06,667
You don´t give a damn
about your work.

834
01:10:06,830 --> 01:10:10,618
Why don´t you buy new overalls,
and shave to come to work!

835
01:10:10,910 --> 01:10:13,549
I´ve had enough.
I´ll find another job.

836
01:10:17,110 --> 01:10:19,101
That stupid ass,
since he left the army,

837
01:10:19,270 --> 01:10:21,465
he acts like a hoodlum.

838
01:10:25,670 --> 01:10:27,581
What´s happening?

839
01:10:27,750 --> 01:10:28,978
I´m quitting.

840
01:10:29,870 --> 01:10:32,942
I had a row with Aubin.
I didn´t wait to be fired.

841
01:10:33,110 --> 01:10:34,145
What will you do?

842
01:10:34,310 --> 01:10:36,266
Live off my pension.

843
01:11:11,150 --> 01:11:12,902
A dry white wine.

844
01:11:20,830 --> 01:11:22,468
Another one.

845
01:11:27,190 --> 01:11:28,748
Help yourseIf.

846
01:11:30,310 --> 01:11:31,629
You have no change?

847
01:11:32,870 --> 01:11:36,021
You´re all the same,
with your big banknotes.

848
01:11:36,390 --> 01:11:37,869
What about you, you bum!

849
01:11:38,030 --> 01:11:39,827
Do your job
and lay off of us!

850
01:11:41,590 --> 01:11:43,308
Drop it.

851
01:12:15,990 --> 01:12:17,503
What are you looking for?

852
01:12:17,670 --> 01:12:18,546
Nothing.

853
01:12:18,710 --> 01:12:20,428
Move your ass.

854
01:12:20,790 --> 01:12:22,860
You´re in the way.

855
01:12:58,150 --> 01:12:59,947
Cognac.

856
01:13:09,270 --> 01:13:11,147
Want to dance?

857
01:13:13,790 --> 01:13:15,746
Leave me alone.

858
01:13:33,590 --> 01:13:35,706
Something wrong, baby?

859
01:13:40,710 --> 01:13:43,429
Come with me, if you want.

860
01:13:45,030 --> 01:13:47,180
You´re really

861
01:13:47,430 --> 01:13:49,898
a sweet girl.

862
01:13:53,790 --> 01:13:55,940
Evening, Madame Germaine.

863
01:13:58,470 --> 01:13:59,983
Evening, Jenny.

864
01:14:28,790 --> 01:14:31,429
You can call me Geneviéve

865
01:14:31,590 --> 01:14:32,989
if you want.

866
01:14:37,910 --> 01:14:41,585
You´re going to say
that I remind you of someone.

867
01:14:44,950 --> 01:14:47,066
Goodbye, Jenny.

868
01:14:48,150 --> 01:14:50,505
Come back again.

869
01:15:08,630 --> 01:15:10,746
Sorry, Madeleine,

870
01:15:12,150 --> 01:15:14,220
I didn´t have my key.

871
01:15:17,270 --> 01:15:19,067
What´s the matter?

872
01:15:19,230 --> 01:15:21,824
Elise died

873
01:15:22,070 --> 01:15:24,026
last night.

874
01:15:50,030 --> 01:15:54,785
I cannot stay any longer

875
01:15:55,630 --> 01:15:58,144
in this apartment.

876
01:15:58,350 --> 01:16:00,181
I am too unhappy.

877
01:16:00,470 --> 01:16:03,701
I want to leave soon.

878
01:16:03,910 --> 01:16:06,470
But where will you go?

879
01:16:06,630 --> 01:16:08,302
I don´t know.

880
01:16:08,470 --> 01:16:10,984
You have no family.

881
01:16:11,150 --> 01:16:14,460
Don´t you want to stay here?

882
01:16:14,710 --> 01:16:15,984
What will I do?

883
01:16:16,150 --> 01:16:17,788
You´ll help me.

884
01:16:17,950 --> 01:16:21,260
I will be lonely.

885
01:16:22,750 --> 01:16:25,708
You don´t need anyone.

886
01:16:26,350 --> 01:16:29,547
I need you, Madeleine.

887
01:16:31,430 --> 01:16:34,263
Why don´t you just say
you don´t like

888
01:16:34,430 --> 01:16:36,580
being alone?

889
01:16:38,750 --> 01:16:42,629
I don´t see
what I could do for you...

890
01:16:42,990 --> 01:16:46,665
I have no influence over you.

891
01:16:48,230 --> 01:16:50,903
That´s not true.

892
01:16:55,470 --> 01:16:58,860
I don´t like
what you´ve become.

893
01:17:00,190 --> 01:17:03,102
You hang about
with nothing to do.

894
01:17:03,270 --> 01:17:06,342
You´re sad and bitter.

895
01:17:06,790 --> 01:17:09,668
You have changed a lot.

896
01:17:09,830 --> 01:17:13,266
It´s not my fault.
Since I came back,

897
01:17:13,430 --> 01:17:16,581
things don´t make sense any more.

898
01:17:16,790 --> 01:17:19,987
I don´t believe I can help you.

899
01:17:20,790 --> 01:17:23,702
You are too far away from me.

900
01:17:23,870 --> 01:17:27,988
If I asked you to try,

901
01:17:28,150 --> 01:17:29,981
despite everything?

902
01:17:30,150 --> 01:17:34,223
I would not hesitate to stay.

903
01:17:35,230 --> 01:17:38,028
I am asking you.

904
01:17:38,310 --> 01:17:41,825
Then I will try.

905
01:18:27,750 --> 01:18:29,900
I am a bit late.

906
01:18:30,750 --> 01:18:33,469
The lawyer was taking for ever.

907
01:18:33,630 --> 01:18:36,190
And I went to the garage.

908
01:18:36,950 --> 01:18:39,828
Now everything is settled.

909
01:18:40,190 --> 01:18:42,146
Poor Elise,

910
01:18:42,550 --> 01:18:45,303
nothing will be left of her.

911
01:18:45,470 --> 01:18:48,382
It´s the opposite.

912
01:18:48,950 --> 01:18:51,623
She will be part of all we do.

913
01:18:55,190 --> 01:18:56,339
Are you happy?

914
01:18:56,510 --> 01:18:58,102
Very happy.

915
01:18:58,390 --> 01:19:01,063
And it is thanks to you.

916
01:19:01,790 --> 01:19:04,179
Yes, Madeleine, you know it.

917
01:19:07,790 --> 01:19:10,748
And you, are you happy?

918
01:19:11,750 --> 01:19:14,708
I am not unhappy.

919
01:19:16,870 --> 01:19:18,508
I wanted to tell you...

920
01:19:18,670 --> 01:19:21,787
well, I´ve been thinking
that if you wanted

921
01:19:21,950 --> 01:19:24,180
to share my life...

922
01:19:24,670 --> 01:19:28,504
if I weren´t
too much of a burden...

923
01:19:29,430 --> 01:19:30,419
and that...

924
01:19:30,590 --> 01:19:31,545
Are you crying?

925
01:19:31,750 --> 01:19:33,422
No.

926
01:19:35,830 --> 01:19:37,946
Did I say the wrong thing?

927
01:19:38,630 --> 01:19:40,188
Not at all...

928
01:19:40,350 --> 01:19:43,387
but it makes me so happy,

929
01:19:43,870 --> 01:19:46,259
and at the same time,
it scares me.

930
01:19:46,430 --> 01:19:48,421
You´re scared of me?

931
01:19:48,590 --> 01:19:51,024
No... a little... well...

932
01:19:51,230 --> 01:19:53,266
you understand...

933
01:19:54,830 --> 01:19:58,220
Have you given up
thinking about Geneviéve?

934
01:19:58,830 --> 01:20:01,742
Are you sure you really love me?

935
01:20:01,910 --> 01:20:04,788
I am not scared
but I wonder

936
01:20:04,950 --> 01:20:08,545
if you´re not acting
out of despair.

937
01:20:09,390 --> 01:20:11,187
You are quite wrong.

938
01:20:11,830 --> 01:20:14,822
I don´t want to think
about Geneviéve any more.

939
01:20:15,110 --> 01:20:18,022
I assure you,
I have forgotten everything.

940
01:20:18,310 --> 01:20:21,541
I want to be happy with you,

941
01:20:21,950 --> 01:20:24,544
Madeleine,
Madeleine, do not cry.

942
01:20:25,030 --> 01:20:27,669
I don´t have much ambition, but...

943
01:20:27,990 --> 01:20:31,744
if I could
make this dream come true:

944
01:20:32,950 --> 01:20:37,182
to be happy with a woman...

945
01:20:37,430 --> 01:20:41,981
in a life
which we would have chosen

946
01:20:42,670 --> 01:20:45,389
together...

947
01:21:05,230 --> 01:21:06,948
I have finished.

948
01:21:08,110 --> 01:21:09,384
It´s very beautiful.

949
01:21:09,550 --> 01:21:10,949
You think so?

950
01:21:17,790 --> 01:21:19,826
Your hands are cold.

951
01:21:23,910 --> 01:21:26,299
I will go out now.

952
01:21:27,270 --> 01:21:28,988
If you want.

953
01:21:30,070 --> 01:21:33,858
The boy would like to see
the toys in the store windows...

954
01:21:34,030 --> 01:21:36,863
He´s been talking about it
for the whole week...

955
01:21:37,630 --> 01:21:41,259
I´ll take him there
until dinner.

956
01:21:42,670 --> 01:21:43,659
Stop that, will you?

957
01:21:43,990 --> 01:21:47,062
François, you´re deafening us.

958
01:21:50,070 --> 01:21:53,779
I got you a lovely
Christmas present.

959
01:21:53,950 --> 01:21:55,178
What is it?

960
01:21:55,350 --> 01:21:58,262
It´s a surprise.
You´ll see.

961
01:22:04,630 --> 01:22:06,746
Cover yourself up.

962
01:22:07,670 --> 01:22:10,025
I love you, Guy.

963
01:22:16,990 --> 01:22:19,458
François!
Come and put your coat on!

964
01:22:26,310 --> 01:22:29,780
Say hello to Santa Claus for me.

965
01:23:00,030 --> 01:23:02,419
Françoise, be quiet.

966
01:23:05,070 --> 01:23:07,630
The horn is not a toy.

967
01:23:23,070 --> 01:23:25,026
It is cold.

968
01:23:25,230 --> 01:23:27,698
Come into the office.

969
01:23:53,390 --> 01:23:56,427
It´s warmer here.

970
01:24:05,470 --> 01:24:09,509
This is the first time
I am back in Cherbourg

971
01:24:10,070 --> 01:24:12,789
since I got married.

972
01:24:14,270 --> 01:24:17,023
I went to pick up my daughter

973
01:24:17,190 --> 01:24:20,182
at my mother-in-law´s
in Anjou.

974
01:24:25,030 --> 01:24:27,180
On the way back to Paris,

975
01:24:27,550 --> 01:24:30,269
I decided to make a detour...

976
01:24:31,510 --> 01:24:34,263
I never thought I´d meet you...

977
01:24:35,430 --> 01:24:38,183
It is pure chance.

978
01:24:40,030 --> 01:24:42,385
Madame wants me to fill up?

979
01:24:42,550 --> 01:24:44,142
Geneviéve...

980
01:24:44,710 --> 01:24:45,938
Yes... Fill it up.

981
01:24:46,110 --> 01:24:47,828
Super or regular?

982
01:24:47,990 --> 01:24:49,867
It doesn´t matter.

983
01:24:50,710 --> 01:24:53,543
Which one do you want?
Super?

984
01:25:00,150 --> 01:25:01,868
This is a pretty tree.

985
01:25:02,030 --> 01:25:04,305
Did you decorate it?

986
01:25:04,470 --> 01:25:08,304
My wife did...
It´s mainly for the kid.

987
01:25:11,910 --> 01:25:13,548
Of course...

988
01:25:15,630 --> 01:25:17,063
Are you in mourning?

989
01:25:17,230 --> 01:25:20,347
Mother died last autumn.

990
01:25:28,150 --> 01:25:30,744
What name did you give her?

991
01:25:30,910 --> 01:25:32,821
Françoise...

992
01:25:33,190 --> 01:25:36,102
She´s very much like you...

993
01:25:36,950 --> 01:25:39,384
Do you want to see her?

994
01:25:44,550 --> 01:25:47,223
I think you can go.

995
01:25:55,910 --> 01:25:58,185
Are you all right?

996
01:25:59,150 --> 01:26:01,505
