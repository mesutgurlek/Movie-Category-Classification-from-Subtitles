1
00:03:15,041 --> 00:03:20,502
Bengaluru

2
00:03:37,163 --> 00:03:40,860
Why are you coming alone, Priya?
Where is Shiva?

3
00:03:41,468 --> 00:03:45,131
He's too much, says he won't
board a standing bus.

4
00:03:45,472 --> 00:03:46,131
He has become big boast.

5
00:03:46,473 --> 00:03:48,839
Can't tolerate his antics anymore?

6
00:03:49,009 --> 00:03:51,603
Look how an idle brain thinks!

7
00:03:51,778 --> 00:03:55,270
We've come leaving our jobs for him
and he's refusing to board the bus.

8
00:03:55,815 --> 00:03:57,146
Where is he?

9
00:04:36,957 --> 00:04:39,221
Does he know where we are going?

10
00:04:39,559 --> 00:04:41,959
Why would he be
bothered to know it?

11
00:04:42,529 --> 00:04:44,121
Look, where he's sitting?

12
00:04:51,237 --> 00:04:53,330
His phone is ringing, tell him.

13
00:04:53,740 --> 00:04:57,267
Your phone is ringing,
should anyone tell you that also?

14
00:05:00,180 --> 00:05:02,944
Hey, call from father.

15
00:05:04,718 --> 00:05:06,208

16
00:05:06,553 --> 00:05:08,111

17
00:05:08,288 --> 00:05:10,552
Couldn't you tell it was your father?

18
00:05:12,325 --> 00:05:14,054
Shiva's father.

19
00:05:16,730 --> 00:05:19,198

We are going to meet our madam.

00:05:27,140 --> 00:05:29,734
Yes, interview is on Monday.

24
00:05:29,909 --> 00:05:32,377
l'm sure he'll get it this time.
- No problem, right?

25
00:05:32,712 --> 00:05:34,043
No, no problem.

26
00:05:34,214 --> 00:05:36,842
Where is he?
- He's here only.

27
00:05:37,317 --> 00:05:39,751
No, l'll talk to him later.
- Okay bye, uncle.

28
00:05:47,594 --> 00:05:48,390
Come.

29
00:05:49,663 --> 00:05:53,099
You won't board a standing bus,
won't you get down also? Come.

30
00:05:54,734 --> 00:05:56,861
Come fast, guys.

31
00:06:37,744 --> 00:06:42,147
What are you looking at?
Don't you want to come? Come.

32
00:06:42,649 --> 00:06:44,810
Come.

33
00:06:51,324 --> 00:06:54,384
Try this one.

34
00:06:55,895 --> 00:06:57,863
This will not work out, Priya.

35
00:06:58,031 --> 00:07:00,124
Do you've atleast one formal dress?

36
00:07:00,300 --> 00:07:02,860
This is best dress to
attend the interview. Go.

37
00:07:03,036 --> 00:07:04,230
This will not be good, Priya.

38
00:07:04,404 --> 00:07:08,841
Don't worry about good or bad,
you need a job now. Go.

39
00:07:19,853 --> 00:07:22,117
You look very handsome.

40
00:07:23,123 --> 00:07:25,023
Shut up, you may turn me
into a mannequin.

41
00:07:25,191 --> 00:07:27,682
Don't compare yourself
with a respectable mannequin.

42
00:07:27,861 --> 00:07:30,091
lt has a job.

43
00:08:14,841 --> 00:08:17,366
Hey what's the matter?
Hey, talking to you only.

44
00:08:17,544 --> 00:08:19,341
Where did you go?
- You won't believe it.

45
00:08:19,512 --> 00:08:21,742
First tell us, then we'll believe it.

46
00:08:22,215 --> 00:08:25,844
A replica of me,
l went to see again but vanished.

47
00:08:26,019 --> 00:08:27,077
Then?

48
00:08:27,253 --> 00:08:31,121
We can't bear one man like you,
how can we tolerate another?

49
00:08:31,291 --> 00:08:33,259
No way! Come.

50
00:08:43,269 --> 00:08:45,829
Where is Shiva?
- Don't know why?

51
00:08:46,005 --> 00:08:48,473
Tomorrow is interview and
he's like possessed.

52
00:08:48,808 --> 00:08:50,935
He's on the terrace.

53
00:09:04,390 --> 00:09:08,554
What happened?
Tensed about the interview?

54
00:09:09,963 --> 00:09:14,332
Keep that in mind.
Only then you'll succeed. Okay?

55
00:09:14,500 --> 00:09:16,468
Meet in the morning.

56
00:09:23,810 --> 00:09:25,437
No need Priya.
- Keep quiet.

57
00:09:25,612 --> 00:09:27,512
lt's problem to me
if l button up the top one.

58
00:09:27,847 --> 00:09:29,212
lt's like holding me by my collar.

59
00:09:29,382 --> 00:09:31,850
This will not work out.
- This will work out.

60
00:09:32,018 --> 00:09:33,883
You could've come clean
shaven atleast today.

61
00:09:34,053 --> 00:09:37,318
l'll miss glamour.

62
00:10:02,482 --> 00:10:04,347
One minute...one minute...

63
00:10:17,363 --> 00:10:19,263
Hey why did you come out?
- What happened, Shiva?

64
00:10:19,432 --> 00:10:21,127
Finished? ls your interview over?
- You've come out so quickly.

65
00:10:21,301 --> 00:10:23,030
Tell me, what happened?

66
00:10:23,536 --> 00:10:25,595
Missed again.
- What? Missed?

67
00:10:26,072 --> 00:10:29,235
We had everything in place,
you say you missed?

68
00:10:29,409 --> 00:10:31,206
l was going in and
she was going out.

69
00:10:31,377 --> 00:10:33,937
Who?
- That girl.

70
00:10:34,113 --> 00:10:36,377
What? Girl?

71
00:10:37,116 --> 00:10:38,174
This is outrageous.

72
00:10:38,351 --> 00:10:41,377
We took two days off from work
to meet madam and fix a job.

73
00:10:41,554 --> 00:10:43,545
He's after a girl, this is not fair.

74
00:10:43,890 --> 00:10:47,326
Wait, if you've a job,
everything will come to you.

75
00:10:47,493 --> 00:10:49,893
lf you settle in life, thousands
of girls will come after you.

76
00:10:50,063 --> 00:10:54,898
ls it fair to lose a job for a girl?
ls it right? You tell me.

77
00:10:55,001 --> 00:10:56,525
Don't try to pacify me.

78
00:11:00,506 --> 00:11:01,564
What were you looking at?

79
00:11:02,408 --> 00:11:03,568
lt was like her.

80
00:11:03,910 --> 00:11:05,400
This is atrocious.

81
00:11:05,578 --> 00:11:09,412
No use talking to you. l'm leaving Priya.
- Wait.

82
00:11:10,950 --> 00:11:14,113
Who is that girl?
- Who knows?

83
00:11:14,287 --> 00:11:16,585
Where is she?
- l've to find it.

84
00:11:17,924 --> 00:11:19,186
Do you know atleast her name?

85
00:11:19,359 --> 00:11:21,259
Call her the name l like the most.

86
00:11:21,928 --> 00:11:26,024
He has become too smart,
let him do his job.

87
00:11:26,199 --> 00:11:28,929
Let's do our job.
Come, let's go.

88
00:12:04,601 --> 00:12:13,942
She came like rain drop...
And vanished into thin air...

89
00:12:14,277 --> 00:12:16,575
You're the love arrow...

90
00:12:16,746 --> 00:12:19,044
You're love symbol...

91
00:12:19,382 --> 00:12:24,012
When you smiled,
my life soared into sky...

92
00:12:24,354 --> 00:12:28,984
My heart tells me to befriend you...

93
00:12:29,325 --> 00:12:34,388
My legs are moving
towards you involuntarily...

94
00:12:34,564 --> 00:12:39,763
You stole my heart away...

95
00:13:09,466 --> 00:13:13,334
Angel...she's an angel...

96
00:13:13,503 --> 00:13:19,339
ls my life enough to see
her beautiful face?

97
00:13:19,509 --> 00:13:23,411
Air is filled with her fragrance...

98
00:13:23,580 --> 00:13:29,348
Will flowers bloom without
seeking her advice?

99
00:13:29,519 --> 00:13:35,856
A strand of hair on her forehead
creates lightning in my heart...

100
00:13:36,025 --> 00:13:39,461
l'm charmed...

101
00:13:39,629 --> 00:13:49,698
l wish to caress her soft cheeks...

102
00:13:49,873 --> 00:13:55,004
My heart wishes to be
anklets on her feet...

103
00:14:34,751 --> 00:14:38,585
As her companion...
without leaving her a second too...

104
00:14:38,755 --> 00:14:44,523
May l be with her always...
she's my inspiration...

105
00:14:44,694 --> 00:14:54,660
l'll rush to hold her shadow too...
And carry it on my heart...

106
00:14:54,838 --> 00:14:58,672
She arrested me at first sight...

107
00:14:58,842 --> 00:15:01,106
She cut me up without any injury...

108
00:15:01,444 --> 00:15:04,607
She has taken my heart...

109
00:15:04,781 --> 00:15:11,118
When l speak to myself...
She eavesdropped there also...

110
00:15:11,454 --> 00:15:15,413
She loves me sweetly...

111
00:16:11,900 --> 00:16:15,427
Priya, don't always have Red Bull,
try this sometimes.

112
00:16:15,604 --> 00:16:16,571
lt'll be super.
- Tell me.

113
00:16:16,738 --> 00:16:18,467
Where are you guys?

114
00:16:18,640 --> 00:16:21,040
You said going in my car will not work
out as sentiment and went by bus.

115
00:16:21,376 --> 00:16:23,071
Did it work out or fizzled?

116
00:16:23,412 --> 00:16:24,709
We are pouring.

117
00:16:24,880 --> 00:16:28,077
Don't drink in car, it'll stink.

118
00:16:30,719 --> 00:16:33,847
Go...go...
- We are quite far from the car.

119
00:16:34,022 --> 00:16:34,852
What's this?

120
00:16:35,023 --> 00:16:37,924
Anyone of you please come to
the railway station to pick us up.

121
00:16:38,093 --> 00:16:40,561
Okay.
- Bye.

122
00:16:41,730 --> 00:16:45,826
Car owner is asking, someone has
to go to station to pick him up.

123
00:16:46,001 --> 00:16:51,735
We are using his car always.
We must send when he needs, right?

124
00:16:52,908 --> 00:16:54,307
Who is going?

125
00:17:10,559 --> 00:17:13,858
lt's me! Where are you?
- At station.- Okay.

126

Senseless!
Where did you lose it?

127
00:17:16,565 --> 00:17:17,497
lt was all because of you.

128
00:17:17,666 --> 00:17:19,930
We must reach Nellore now,
how are we going to reach?

129
00:17:20,102 --> 00:17:24,129
Hello madam, we are on the way.
The girl lost the tickets.

130

He's also refusing.

Do we've to stand here

154
00:18:36,044 --> 00:18:40,174
You're running a travel agency

155
00:18:40,515 --> 00:18:42,847
Give her to me.

00:18:56,431 --> 00:18:58,092
How are you coming?
- We are coming in car.

162
00:18:58,433 --> 00:18:59,092
You arrange everything.

163
00:18:59,434 --> 00:19:02,767
l'll do that,
when will you reach here?

164
00:19:03,138 --> 00:19:05,936
Can we be there by 4 pm?
- We can.

165
00:19:06,108 --> 00:19:08,440
Yes madam, we'll be there by 4 pm.

166
00:19:08,610 --> 00:19:10,805
This girl spoilt everything.
- Okay.

167
00:19:10,979 --> 00:19:14,005
You come to the registrar's office.
We'll be there, okay madam.

168
00:19:14,182 --> 00:19:15,979
l'll cut now.
- Okay.

169
00:19:16,151 --> 00:19:17,618
Go fast.

170
00:19:17,786 --> 00:19:19,720
We must reach by 4 pm, right?
l'll take care of it.

171
00:19:19,888 --> 00:19:22,550
Do you've any sense?
Look, how we are getting late.

172
00:19:22,724 --> 00:19:25,249
l've to reply because of you.

173
00:19:31,466 --> 00:19:35,459
No other way?
Why did you get into the jam?

174
00:19:35,637 --> 00:19:39,095
Do we expect these things?
We've to go by this road only.

175
00:19:39,641 --> 00:19:43,077
Gone! l don't think this
will end now.

176
00:19:43,578 --> 00:19:45,102
Are you happy now?
You must be very happy now.

177
00:19:46,281 --> 00:19:47,976
We are caught up here.

178
00:19:53,221 --> 00:19:55,655
Where are you going, man?

179
00:19:56,792 --> 00:19:58,020
What will do there?

180
00:19:58,193 --> 00:19:59,785
Why are you creating
a scene on the road?

181
00:19:59,961 --> 00:20:02,156
Take your vehicle.
- First ask him to take his vehicle.

182
00:20:02,497 --> 00:20:07,264
Beat him, he hit the auto and not
giving way for over half an hour.

183
00:20:07,736 --> 00:20:08,668
Take your vehicle.

184
00:20:10,205 --> 00:20:11,194
Go!

185
00:20:17,946 --> 00:20:21,882
Creating a scene for silly problem,
only thrashing will speak to them.

186
00:20:22,050 --> 00:20:23,312
That's why l slapped him.

187
00:20:38,133 --> 00:20:42,126
Hello...madam...
we are on the way...

188
00:20:42,671 --> 00:20:47,973
Ban... madam, we are coming.

189
00:20:48,143 --> 00:20:51,044
We've left Bangalore.
Okay madam.

190
00:20:57,219 --> 00:20:59,084
You go...go...

191
00:21:07,662 --> 00:21:09,721
How much sir?
- Fill it for Rs.1000.

192
00:21:21,910 --> 00:21:24,071
5 betel leaves.
- 120?

193
00:21:29,618 --> 00:21:31,108
Hello, one minute.

194
00:21:31,953 --> 00:21:33,580
Can you take the car?
- What?

195
00:21:33,755 --> 00:21:35,086
Please start the car.

196
00:21:35,690 --> 00:21:36,349
He must come, right?

197
00:21:36,691 --> 00:21:38,124
He needn't come, please listen to me.

198
00:21:38,293 --> 00:21:39,851
Please take the car.

199
00:21:48,870 --> 00:21:53,933
Hey stop the car...
- Go fast.

200
00:21:54,943 --> 00:21:56,205
Faster!

201
00:22:00,682 --> 00:22:02,343
Tell me.
- Madam, it's me.

202
00:22:02,684 --> 00:22:04,379
The girl left with the driver.

203
00:22:04,719 --> 00:22:08,951
What happened to me today?
Why my heart is excited?

204
00:22:09,124 --> 00:22:10,318
Will you please lower the volume?

205
00:22:10,659 --> 00:22:13,423
l didn't switch it on,
it started on its own.

206
00:22:14,629 --> 00:22:18,121
What's the problem?
- Will you drive quietly?

207
00:22:20,101 --> 00:22:21,363
Where do you want to go?
- Go to the airport.

208
00:22:25,440 --> 00:22:29,001
That guy's phone is ringing.
- Pick it.

209
00:22:31,913 --> 00:22:35,246
l didn't mean to answer the call.
l said to pick it up.

210
00:22:55,670 --> 00:22:57,399
Take.

211
00:23:08,717 --> 00:23:11,914
Where are you?
He's shouting on us over phone.

212
00:23:12,087 --> 00:23:14,214
l'm in airport.
- Airport?

213
00:23:14,389 --> 00:23:18,189
l'm dazed...that girl.
She got into the car.

214
00:23:18,360 --> 00:23:20,692
She was with me till now.
- With you?

215
00:23:20,862 --> 00:23:23,422
Just now l dropped her at airport.

216
00:23:24,199 --> 00:23:27,362
Do you know she was
in Bangalore till now?

217
00:23:27,869 --> 00:23:30,235
Pouring rain...one umbrella...

218
00:23:30,405 --> 00:23:32,236
How will it be if two go
without getting wet?

219
00:23:32,407 --> 00:23:33,237
lt's like that.

220
00:23:33,408 --> 00:23:35,171
Rain in Bangalore?

221
00:23:35,343 --> 00:23:37,470
Just for an assumption.

222
00:23:38,446 --> 00:23:40,880
Just now, she left.

223
00:23:41,883 --> 00:23:44,374
She flew away.
- Did she fly away?

224
00:23:44,719 --> 00:23:45,981
ln a flight?
- Yes.

225
00:23:46,154 --> 00:23:48,054
l didn't expect this in my life.

226
00:23:48,990 --> 00:23:50,389
l missed my flight.

227
00:23:52,927 --> 00:23:55,896
Please take the car.
- Let's go, sit in.

228
00:23:57,332 --> 00:23:59,095
l'll call you later.

229
00:24:10,745 --> 00:24:13,908
Where do you want to go now?
- Railway station.

230
00:24:14,315 --> 00:24:15,942
You came from there just now.

231
00:24:16,117 --> 00:24:18,085
Will you please go without
asking questions?

232
00:24:18,553 --> 00:24:22,080
l can see you're tensed
but don't know what it is.

233
00:24:35,003 --> 00:24:38,131
Keep this.
- No need.

234
00:24:38,306 --> 00:24:39,933
No, please keep it.
- You've already paid me.

235
00:24:54,789 --> 00:24:56,552
lt's me!

236
00:25:14,476 --> 00:25:16,910
l asked her but got no reply...

237
00:25:17,912 --> 00:25:19,345
Start the car immediately.
- Get in.

238
00:25:27,522 --> 00:25:29,922
Missed the train too?

239
00:25:30,091 --> 00:25:31,615
Will you please drive quietly?

240
00:25:36,197 --> 00:25:39,291
l can go only if l know
the destination, right?

241
00:25:39,467 --> 00:25:41,162
Go somewhere.

242
00:25:42,203 --> 00:25:46,003
Stop at some high altitude.
l'll jump down to my death.

243
00:26:07,495 --> 00:26:09,019
Please come out.

244
00:26:09,597 --> 00:26:12,361
This is the highest place l know.
Please come.

245
00:26:13,668 --> 00:26:17,195
l said just like that,
will you bring me the place really?

246
00:26:17,372 --> 00:26:19,306
Looks like you may even
push me down.

247
00:26:19,474 --> 00:26:21,032
l'll tell you, please come.

248
00:26:34,422 --> 00:26:36,549
Look, how big the city is!

249
00:26:36,891 --> 00:26:38,688
lt looks like a dot from here, right?

250
00:26:38,927 --> 00:26:40,326
Our problems too are like that only.

251
00:26:40,495 --> 00:26:42,087
When you see it closer, it's very big,

252
00:26:42,263 --> 00:26:44,163
when you see it from far, it's small.

253
00:26:44,332 --> 00:26:46,960
Did you see how many ups and
downs were there on the way?

254
00:26:47,135 --> 00:26:48,568
Life too is like that.

255
00:26:48,903 --> 00:26:51,394
How can you talk about suicide?

256
00:26:53,308 --> 00:26:56,903
l can sense you're in trouble.
But l don't know what it is.

257
00:26:57,345 --> 00:27:00,075
lf you need any help from me,
ask, l'll do it.

258
00:27:03,117 --> 00:27:04,414
lf you trust me.

259
00:27:11,626 --> 00:27:14,322
Didn't feel like trusting me?

260
00:27:15,129 --> 00:27:18,428
Can you take me to Bombay?
- Bombay?

261
00:27:45,792 --> 00:27:51,526
She came like a flower...

262
00:27:53,533 --> 00:27:58,971
She filled happiness in my life...

263
00:27:59,873 --> 00:28:06,676
Fragrant breezes whizzing
past my heart...

264
00:28:07,581 --> 00:28:14,885
Her eyes are shining with
vibrant colours of youth...

265
00:28:16,223 --> 00:28:19,852
There's so much in heart but
not word comes out...

266
00:28:20,193 --> 00:28:24,562
There are no more dreams
to my eyes...

267
00:28:27,901 --> 00:28:29,698
Don't beat me mother.
- What's this childishness on road?

268
00:28:29,870 --> 00:28:32,839
Had you fallen under the car?
- He wouldn't get hurt so much.

269
00:28:39,946 --> 00:28:42,813
You've taken his car,
don't show up for 3 days.

270
00:28:42,983 --> 00:28:43,745
He'll kill you.

271
00:28:43,917 --> 00:28:46,477
Not 3 days, l'll not show up in
6 days, l'm going to Bombay.

272
00:28:46,653 --> 00:28:47,915
What? Bombay?

273
00:28:48,255 --> 00:28:50,723
Yes, she requested me to drop
her there, l'm going with her.

274
00:28:50,891 --> 00:28:52,688
l may need money on the way,
deposit in my account.

275
00:28:52,859 --> 00:28:54,724
Deposit money?

276
00:29:00,367 --> 00:29:03,029
You can tell me atleast now,
what's your problem?

277
00:29:03,370 --> 00:29:04,997
Please don't ask me.

278
00:29:05,839 --> 00:29:09,673
When silence rules heart...

279
00:29:09,843 --> 00:29:13,506
Getting enchanted by desire...

280
00:29:13,680 --> 00:29:21,587
First sight of her was like
lightning striking my heart...

281
00:29:21,755 --> 00:29:29,526
Adjusting the rear view mirror to
see with eyes filled with adoration...

282
00:29:29,696 --> 00:29:37,432
O girl, l've got drenched
in love before you...

283
00:29:37,604 --> 00:29:40,971
Like hovering cloud...

284
00:29:41,308 --> 00:29:44,835
You're the star of my life...

285
00:29:45,011 --> 00:29:53,077
Running like wild stream of love,
l forgot about myself...

286
00:30:10,804 --> 00:30:12,465
Hey, it's Shiva.
- Switch on the speaker.

287
00:30:12,639 --> 00:30:14,698
How do l drive the car?

288
00:30:14,875 --> 00:30:16,809
Have l ever given way
to any vehicle?

289
00:30:16,977 --> 00:30:21,038
Now, everything is different.
l'm flying in air.

290
00:30:21,381 --> 00:30:24,350
Someone brushed my car and
l wasn't getting angry too.

291
00:30:24,518 --> 00:30:26,577
Why is it like that?
- Because it's my car.

292
00:30:26,753 --> 00:30:28,653
How can you get angry?

293
00:30:30,323 --> 00:30:31,915
He cut the line as usual.

294
00:30:38,565 --> 00:30:41,056
Enough...stop it.
- Sir asked to fill the tank.

295
00:30:41,401 --> 00:30:42,766
No, don't have much money.

296
00:30:42,936 --> 00:30:44,426
No madam,
sir asked me to fill the tank.

297
00:30:44,604 --> 00:30:45,536
What's the problem?

298
00:30:45,705 --> 00:30:47,605
You asked to fill the tank
and madam wants to stop.

299
00:30:47,774 --> 00:30:49,503
l told him to stop earlier itself.

300
00:30:49,676 --> 00:30:52,406
Now running short by Rs. 100,
what to do?

301
00:30:52,746 --> 00:30:53,906
You fill the tank.

302
00:30:54,080 --> 00:30:55,707
l've this much only.

303
00:30:55,882 --> 00:30:58,749
We can't reach Bombay for
the money you have.

304
00:30:58,919 --> 00:31:00,113
Keep it with you.

305
00:31:02,456 --> 00:31:07,416
Keep the account,
l'll pay after reaching Bombay.

306
00:31:07,594 --> 00:31:09,858
l'm very weak in maths.

307
00:31:11,097 --> 00:31:12,860
Then, l'll keep the account.

308
00:31:15,001 --> 00:31:18,732
She sweeps away like a wave...

309
00:31:18,905 --> 00:31:22,568
Her name spreads fragrance...

310
00:31:22,742 --> 00:31:30,706
l'm enchanted by the
dream coming true...

311
00:31:30,951 --> 00:31:38,585
l'm hearing old tales of
love and promises...

312
00:31:38,758 --> 00:31:45,061
l'm standing like the
light of the highway...

313
00:31:45,398 --> 00:31:46,160
Get down and offer prayers.

314
00:31:46,533 --> 00:31:50,060
The songs that are ringing in my heart...

315
00:31:50,403 --> 00:31:53,930
l'm happy that it's all about you only...

316
00:31:54,107 --> 00:32:02,173
lf you come as my companion,
the distance will get shorter...

317
00:33:00,327 --> 00:33:03,262
Brother, this is the number,
they filled the petrol here only.

318
00:33:03,664 --> 00:33:07,100
Madam, they filled in this
petrol bunk only.

319
00:33:07,268 --> 00:33:09,759
We are following them.
We can surely catch them.

320
00:33:16,177 --> 00:33:19,510
Nobody would want to betray
my innocent mother.

321
00:33:20,448 --> 00:33:24,282
She wouldn't have expected
dad will do like this.

322
00:33:24,718 --> 00:33:26,845
Moreover theirs was
a love marriage.

323
00:33:29,123 --> 00:33:32,388
But dad never behaved properly
for mother's honest nature.

324
00:33:32,560 --> 00:33:39,295
Dad started as small builder in Hyderabad
and started growing big.

325
00:33:40,868 --> 00:33:44,497
Another girl came into
my dad's life.

326
00:33:44,672 --> 00:33:49,735
Mother hid everything.
That was mother's biggest mistake.

327
00:33:49,910 --> 00:33:53,311
Dad took advantage of it
and went overboard.

328
00:33:53,948 --> 00:33:59,545
One day dad came home and said
that girl's brother is my groom.

329
00:33:59,720 --> 00:34:01,688
Mother didn't like it.
There was a big fight.

330
00:34:01,856 --> 00:34:03,289
Dad beat my mother.

331
00:34:03,457 --> 00:34:07,826
She slept that night
never to wake up again.

332
00:34:11,165 --> 00:34:16,330
After mom's death,
they tried to force things on me.

333
00:34:18,405 --> 00:34:21,340
Then l decided to leave the place.

334
00:34:21,809 --> 00:34:26,337
l left home to find a job
and a place of my own.

335
00:34:26,680 --> 00:34:29,581
l stayed in Bangalore
to find a job.

336
00:34:29,750 --> 00:34:32,548
Jayaraman came there
and found me.

337
00:34:33,554 --> 00:34:35,283
He's dad's partner.

338
00:34:35,523 --> 00:34:39,459
He said there won't be any problem
if l transfer property to them.

339
00:34:39,627 --> 00:34:40,685
l too believed him and went.

340
00:34:40,861 --> 00:34:45,855
On the way l came to know he wasn't
taking me to register the property,

341
00:34:46,200 --> 00:34:47,565
but for marriage registration.

342
00:34:47,735 --> 00:34:50,465
l got a chance to escape
from him in the petrol bunk,

343
00:34:50,638 --> 00:34:52,731
that's why l came with you.

344
00:34:54,808 --> 00:34:57,709
l'm now going to my grandma's
place in Bombay.

345
00:35:03,651 --> 00:35:07,280
Hey, tell me.
- Are you in office?

346
00:35:07,454 --> 00:35:10,946
lmportant matter.
She told me her story,

347
00:35:11,292 --> 00:35:14,989
she told me of many problems.
l didn't hear much.

348
00:35:15,663 --> 00:35:19,963
She said lastly about running away
from a marriage forced on her.

349
00:35:20,467 --> 00:35:21,934
l was very happy to hear it.

350
00:35:22,269 --> 00:35:23,566
l feel the route is clear to me.

351
00:35:23,737 --> 00:35:27,002
Don't celebrate so quickly,
she came running away from a marriage,

352
00:35:27,341 --> 00:35:30,572
she may have a lover,
just inquire with her.

353
00:35:32,947 --> 00:35:34,778
You'll never let anyone be happy.

354
00:35:34,949 --> 00:35:36,746
Can't you ever say something good?

355
00:35:36,917 --> 00:35:38,407
Cut the line, l'll call you later.

356
00:35:38,652 --> 00:35:39,778
Shall we go?

357
00:35:48,462 --> 00:35:51,693
You didn't like the marriage...
anything like...

358
00:35:51,865 --> 00:35:55,266
What?
- Love...anything like that?

359
00:35:55,436 --> 00:35:57,597
No, nothing like that.

360
00:36:10,017 --> 00:36:16,445
l've a dream about the qualities
the man should have.

361
00:36:16,924 --> 00:36:18,084
How should he be?

362
00:36:19,660 --> 00:36:21,560
First is job,

363
00:36:28,669 --> 00:36:32,469
second is...l can judge on seeing.

364
00:36:33,040 --> 00:36:36,737
Too much! How can you judge on seeing?
- l can.

365
00:36:36,910 --> 00:36:39,708
The dress he wears,
the way he talks,

366
00:36:39,880 --> 00:36:42,110
the way he sees,
everything will tell about him.

367
00:36:42,449 --> 00:36:44,076
About the man's character.

368
00:36:45,653 --> 00:36:48,747
To say simply, ring tone too will
tell about his character.

369
00:36:48,922 --> 00:36:50,651
What sort of a character we are.

370
00:36:55,496 --> 00:36:58,829
Why did you cut the call?
No problem, answer the call.

371
00:37:00,067 --> 00:37:01,864
There's nothing to speak.

372
00:37:15,683 --> 00:37:18,811
Come, let's eat something.
- No, l'm not hungry.

373
00:37:18,986 --> 00:37:21,853
lf you're not hungry,
give me company.

374
00:37:26,627 --> 00:37:28,060
What would you like to have sir?
- One butter dosa.

375
00:37:28,395 --> 00:37:29,453
Okay sir.

376
00:37:29,897 --> 00:37:32,627
Butter dosa doesn't mean
you should stuff with it,

377
00:37:32,800 --> 00:37:36,361
roast dosa to golden brown,
add little butter, that's enough.

378
00:37:36,537 --> 00:37:38,698
Most important,
don't turn the dosa.

379
00:37:38,872 --> 00:37:40,806
Let it fry on one side only.

380
00:37:41,508 --> 00:37:43,373
Do you've mini idly?
- We do sir.

381
00:37:44,378 --> 00:37:46,846
Why are you going away?

382
00:37:47,014 --> 00:37:48,879
You've curd vada?
- Yes sir.

383
00:37:49,383 --> 00:37:51,544
Anything else sir?
- That's all.

384
00:37:53,487 --> 00:37:55,717
One mineral water bottle.

385
00:38:02,830 --> 00:38:10,202
Curd vada, mini idly,
okay...ghee roast.

386
00:38:13,407 --> 00:38:18,208
l said no just for namesake.
Won't you ask me again?

387
00:38:19,012 --> 00:38:22,914
l've ordered this for you only,
have it.

388
00:38:24,051 --> 00:38:28,579
l could see in your eyes that your
lips were lying about hunger.

389
00:38:28,989 --> 00:38:29,921
Have it.

390
00:38:30,657 --> 00:38:33,751
Thank you very much.
- No need of that, please have it.

391
00:38:37,097 --> 00:38:38,155
Slowly...

392
00:38:41,635 --> 00:38:43,068
You could've ordered
something for you also.

393
00:38:43,237 --> 00:38:44,932
You carry on, l'll order.

394
00:38:45,672 --> 00:38:48,004
Hello, a plain dosa.
- Anything else sir?

395
00:38:48,175 --> 00:38:49,233
That's all.

396
00:38:56,450 --> 00:38:57,974
You're eating so much
without feeling hungry,

397
00:38:58,152 --> 00:38:59,983
just thinking how much would
you eat if you were hungry.

398
00:39:00,154 --> 00:39:03,954
Don't cast evil eye.
Keep it in account.

399
00:39:10,664 --> 00:39:11,995
Sorry...for you?

400
00:39:12,166 --> 00:39:13,463
No problem, you have it,
l'll order another one.

401
00:39:13,634 --> 00:39:15,795
No, you have it.
- Sure?

402
00:39:26,980 --> 00:39:29,210
Hello, your man is sitting there.

403
00:39:31,485 --> 00:39:32,247
My man?

404
00:39:32,586 --> 00:39:37,922
You said about your dream man,
l thought he could be like him.

405
00:39:38,091 --> 00:39:39,080
Am l right?

406
00:39:50,170 --> 00:39:52,502
Hello, your man is blocking the way.

407
00:39:58,679 --> 00:40:02,513
Hi! My car has broke down.
My office is on the highway.

408
00:40:02,683 --> 00:40:04,617
Can you give me a lift?

409
00:40:04,785 --> 00:40:05,979
Didn't get you?

410
00:40:06,153 --> 00:40:08,986
He's asking if you could
drop him on the way.

411
00:40:09,156 --> 00:40:11,021
His car broke down.

412
00:40:15,128 --> 00:40:16,220
Front!

413
00:40:29,776 --> 00:40:31,334
Charu...Charulatha.

414
00:40:48,896 --> 00:40:51,057
He's talking too much.

415
00:41:57,331 --> 00:41:58,889
Dog crossed the road.

416
00:42:04,438 --> 00:42:07,134
Why are you driving rash?
Drive smoothly.

417
00:42:14,014 --> 00:42:17,313
Have we reached your place?
l thought of dumping you out.

418
00:42:25,092 --> 00:42:26,821
Take it.

419
00:42:59,259 --> 00:43:00,886
He's doing too much.

420
00:43:01,061 --> 00:43:02,858
Looks like he'll fix marriage too.

421
00:43:03,063 --> 00:43:04,462
l'll take him to task.

422
00:43:08,368 --> 00:43:11,201
What happened?
- Who knows? l must check.

423
00:43:25,752 --> 00:43:28,516
Bloody sticky guy!

424
00:43:42,936 --> 00:43:48,238
Enough of it, come.
Come...You're too much!

425
00:43:52,379 --> 00:43:54,779
This is the perfect vehicle
for you....come.

426
00:43:54,948 --> 00:43:56,381
How dare you trouble me!

427
00:43:56,883 --> 00:43:58,544
Dump him somewhere on the way.

428
00:44:08,995 --> 00:44:13,557
Hello...you said it'll take half day.
How did it start now?

429
00:44:14,234 --> 00:44:17,032
Don't know why, the moment he got
down, the car ignited instantly.

430
00:44:17,204 --> 00:44:22,107
You didn't like him, did you?
- l didn't understand him.

431
00:45:26,303 --> 00:45:28,328
You know what's Charu doing now?

432
00:45:28,505 --> 00:45:29,494
She's sleeping.

433
00:45:29,673 --> 00:45:33,370
Entire country is sleeping,
is it news if Charu too sleeps?

434
00:45:33,544 --> 00:45:37,503
You're calling at 2 am to tell Charu is
sleeping, what do you mean by it?

435
00:45:37,681 --> 00:45:40,548
What? ls it 2 am now?
- Yes.

436
00:45:40,718 --> 00:45:42,413
l came to know after you told me.

437
00:45:42,586 --> 00:45:47,683
The moment she got into the car,
l'm beyond time.

438
00:45:48,225 --> 00:45:50,250
l'm totally confused.

439
00:45:50,594 --> 00:45:54,257
Only few look beautiful
while sleeping and crying.

440
00:45:54,698 --> 00:45:57,895
Charu is one of them.
You know how she is?

441
00:45:58,469 --> 00:45:59,436
You won't believe me,

442
00:45:59,603 --> 00:46:01,594
l came to know her name
was Charu just now.

443
00:46:01,772 --> 00:46:03,603
But l would've chanted her name
more than 100 times.

444
00:46:03,774 --> 00:46:08,643
How's it possible when the person you like
is near everything around appears like them?

445
00:46:08,812 --> 00:46:09,870
Will you believe this?

446
00:46:10,214 --> 00:46:13,115
l've started admiring moon also.

447
00:46:16,353 --> 00:46:18,548
Look, how many times he has
called all the night.

448
00:46:18,722 --> 00:46:20,349
64 missed calls to
all four of us.

449
00:46:20,524 --> 00:46:22,287
He's a big torture.

450
00:46:23,360 --> 00:46:25,294
He's calling again.

451
00:46:26,730 --> 00:46:29,130
You know what is Charu doing now?

452
00:46:29,299 --> 00:46:32,132
What would she be doing morning?
Brushing her teeth.

453
00:46:41,345 --> 00:46:43,472
How do they find all these things?

454
00:46:44,848 --> 00:46:45,815
He cut the call.

455
00:46:46,150 --> 00:46:49,950
He's torturing us with his calls, right?
You call him now.

456
00:46:52,156 --> 00:46:52,952
What?

457
00:46:53,323 --> 00:46:55,723
Why are you cutting the call?
Tell me.

458
00:46:55,893 --> 00:46:59,329
Though you're in hearing mood,
l'm not in telling mood, hang it up.

459
00:47:04,401 --> 00:47:05,299
What?

460
00:47:05,469 --> 00:47:06,731
Why are you cutting my call?
- Why are you teasing him?

461
00:47:06,904 --> 00:47:08,337
Don't you've any work today?
- Give it to me.

462
00:47:10,774 --> 00:47:13,208
What? You're calling all the night
to disturb our sleep.

463
00:47:13,377 --> 00:47:15,971
Torture? Who said that?

464
00:47:16,780 --> 00:47:20,841
That's okay, how far it has come?
- About 500 kms?

465
00:47:21,552 --> 00:47:25,283
Not that, how far it has come
between you both?

466
00:47:25,456 --> 00:47:27,185
Oh that one!

467
00:47:28,192 --> 00:47:30,888
You've told me everything,
have you told her anything about this?

468
00:47:31,228 --> 00:47:33,856
She shouldn't know it from me,
she must feel it.

469
00:47:34,198 --> 00:47:35,222
What? Feel?

470
00:47:35,399 --> 00:47:38,197
This moment, this second
l'm very happy.

471
00:47:38,368 --> 00:47:41,735
l like travelling with her.
l'm enjoying it.

472
00:47:41,905 --> 00:47:44,669
You're enjoying, it's okay,
how will she know it?

473
00:47:44,842 --> 00:47:49,745
Whether it's ice or fire if it's brought
near our back, we can feel it.

474
00:47:49,913 --> 00:47:51,210
Like wise, she'll also feel it.

475
00:47:51,381 --> 00:47:53,212
lt shouldn't be expressed.

476
00:47:53,383 --> 00:47:57,410
What's this boys? He's talking
philosophy citing ice and fire.

477
00:47:57,588 --> 00:47:59,021
Give me the phone.

478
00:48:00,224 --> 00:48:02,215
Buddy, l'll give you few tips.

479
00:48:02,392 --> 00:48:07,022
Don't go on travel, on the way
stop at any roadside eatery.

480
00:48:07,364 --> 00:48:13,462
Same room, dim light, night,
mood of girls is different then,

481
00:48:13,637 --> 00:48:17,801
girls seen in day time are different at
nights, decency will to go to dogs,

482
00:48:18,275 --> 00:48:21,733
it will bloom then, slowly...
if you brush her leg with yours...

483
00:48:21,912 --> 00:48:24,972
Don't talk rotten things.
Are girls so cheap to you?

484
00:48:26,950 --> 00:48:30,511
Priya, give the phone to him.
- He wants to talk to you.

485
00:48:30,687 --> 00:48:32,416
Has my idea worked?

486
00:48:36,426 --> 00:48:39,793
What is he saying?
- He said super.

487
00:48:39,963 --> 00:48:43,421
Don't try to manage,
drizzle is falling here also. Wipe it.

488
00:48:55,279 --> 00:48:56,337
Get down.

489
00:48:57,281 --> 00:48:58,270
Get your papers.

490
00:48:58,448 --> 00:48:59,540
Show your RC book,
driving license.

491
00:48:59,716 --> 00:49:01,013
Looks like l've to manage him now.
- Come on show me.

492
00:49:01,351 --> 00:49:03,080
No sir.
- Don't you've?

493
00:49:03,887 --> 00:49:04,819
Come here sir.
- Where are you taking me?

494
00:49:04,988 --> 00:49:07,616
Come, let's talk it out.
- Where?

495
00:49:09,293 --> 00:49:10,783
You go...go...

496
00:49:14,698 --> 00:49:18,361
Why did you pay him?
Why didn't you show your license?

497
00:49:18,535 --> 00:49:20,025
l don't have all that.

498
00:49:20,370 --> 00:49:22,736
You're a driver,
won't you keep papers?

499
00:49:22,906 --> 00:49:27,707
Hello...l'm not a driver.
- Not a driver?- Yes.

500
00:49:28,645 --> 00:49:33,639
Oh God! Sorry...l talked bad about you
without knowing you're the owner.

501
00:49:34,051 --> 00:49:36,485
Hello, l'm not the owner too.

502
00:49:36,653 --> 00:49:37,745
Not the owner too?

503
00:49:37,921 --> 00:49:40,981
Friend's car, l came to the
station to pick him up,

504
00:49:41,325 --> 00:49:43,384
suddenly he came asked
if l can ply to Nellore,

505
00:49:43,560 --> 00:49:46,825
you were next to him,
you were tensed,

506
00:49:46,997 --> 00:49:50,489
l felt you were in trouble
so l came with you,

507
00:49:50,968 --> 00:49:53,664
but l didn't expect
l'll be travelling to Bombay.

508
00:49:55,572 --> 00:49:57,096
Thank you very much.

509
00:50:01,478 --> 00:50:02,570
What did you say now?

510
00:50:03,046 --> 00:50:04,513
Thank you very much.

511
00:50:06,516 --> 00:50:07,847
No problem, forget it.

512
00:50:23,600 --> 00:50:24,862
Open the boot.

513
00:50:32,676 --> 00:50:34,541
Okay sir.
- Wash full body.

514
00:51:45,916 --> 00:51:47,076
Madam!
- What happened?

515
00:51:47,250 --> 00:51:48,547
Not yet seen her.

516
00:51:48,719 --> 00:51:50,448
l'll call you immediately
on seeing her.

517
00:52:16,646 --> 00:52:17,510
Who is that?

518
00:52:17,681 --> 00:52:19,239
Are you blind? Get down, bloody

519
00:52:19,583 --> 00:52:20,743
Sir...sir...no sir...

520
00:52:20,917 --> 00:52:26,753
Sir, please don't hurt him.
- Sir...sir...

521
00:52:26,923 --> 00:52:29,289
Who is that beating our man?

522
00:52:43,740 --> 00:52:44,536
What happened, Shiva?

523
00:52:44,708 --> 00:52:47,677
Some trouble.
Good, we left the place.

524
00:53:04,761 --> 00:53:06,956
Not a place around to stop by.

525
00:53:08,632 --> 00:53:10,327
Can't hold on any more.

526
00:53:28,084 --> 00:53:31,713
Super! l thought and you stopped.
- You too?

527
00:53:32,122 --> 00:53:35,717
l thought of stopping you,
but you stopped on your own.

528
00:54:05,689 --> 00:54:09,386
Shiva! See what a big waterfalls here!

529
00:54:09,893 --> 00:54:11,087
What? There too?

530
00:54:11,261 --> 00:54:13,752
Come here.
- Coming.

531
00:54:21,071 --> 00:54:23,062
Why are you standing here?

532
00:54:23,240 --> 00:54:27,074
lsn't it nice, Shiva?
- Super!

533
00:54:27,244 --> 00:54:29,269
How did you feel like stopping here?

534
00:54:30,614 --> 00:54:33,014
How can l go on without stopping?
- Tell me.

535
00:54:33,416 --> 00:54:37,284
l felt it, humid air, gushing water
sound in a distance.

536
00:54:37,621 --> 00:54:38,280
l felt it.

537
00:54:38,622 --> 00:54:40,783
Did you hear this sound inside?

538
00:54:41,091 --> 00:54:43,116
l did hear.
Didn't you hear it?

539
00:54:44,628 --> 00:54:45,856
What's this?

540
00:54:46,029 --> 00:54:48,793
Now l know why you're so happy.

541
00:54:49,032 --> 00:54:51,000
You love nature?

542
00:54:51,167 --> 00:54:52,395
Don't ask me that.

543
00:54:52,736 --> 00:54:54,931
When l see such places,
it'll overflow.

544
00:54:55,105 --> 00:54:57,437
Extempore poetry.

545
00:55:00,844 --> 00:55:02,971
lt's going to rain,
let's get into the car. Come.

546
00:55:03,146 --> 00:55:05,114
You love nature but
running away from rain.

547
00:55:05,282 --> 00:55:07,147
Don't you like rain?

548
00:55:12,889 --> 00:55:16,154
Why not?...l must go away
at the first drop falling,

549
00:55:16,326 --> 00:55:18,760
if not l'll not go even if rain stops.

550
00:55:18,929 --> 00:55:21,295
l'll get wet totally.

551
00:55:21,464 --> 00:55:24,956
Please understand me, come.
Let's go.

552
00:55:25,135 --> 00:55:26,932
Why should we postpone
things we love?

553
00:55:27,103 --> 00:55:28,764
lf you love rain, get wet.

554
00:55:28,939 --> 00:55:32,466
Nothing to achieve there.
Enjoy the rain.

555
00:56:40,543 --> 00:56:44,035
lt's heavily pouring down...

556
00:56:44,380 --> 00:56:48,146
lf she smiles beautifully,
it's flowery rain...

557
00:56:55,858 --> 00:56:59,191
lt's raining continuously and
l'm holding umbrella in my heart...

558
00:56:59,528 --> 00:57:03,396
Thirst increases...
distance shortens...

559
00:57:03,566 --> 00:57:06,865
Don't know what's happening...
something has happened...

560
00:57:07,036 --> 00:57:10,733
When she dances in rain
like the peacock...

561
00:57:10,906 --> 00:57:14,842
Love is taking over my heart...

562
00:58:05,094 --> 00:58:09,724
Song which was never sung...

563
00:58:09,899 --> 00:58:13,528
Singing beautifully
the unheard song...

564
00:58:13,702 --> 00:58:17,229
My salutations to rain for
uniting you with me...

565
00:58:17,573 --> 00:58:20,974
l've lost myself,
search in your heart...

566
00:58:21,143 --> 00:58:24,738
lt's like mantra and
a new tantra...

567
00:58:24,914 --> 00:58:28,645
Strangely a battle is going in my heart...

568
00:58:28,817 --> 00:58:36,815
Where is my angel?
She's dancing happily here...

569
00:59:11,527 --> 00:59:14,985
No one is better you in this world...

570
00:59:15,164 --> 00:59:18,861
You can't get a better man than me...

571
00:59:19,034 --> 00:59:22,697
He sent me with two small eyes...

572
00:59:22,871 --> 00:59:26,204
Though my eyes are closed...
l stand by what l said...

573
00:59:26,542 --> 00:59:30,034
On this enchanting day, kiss me...

574
00:59:30,212 --> 00:59:34,012
Behind it, my dear says
to keep distance...

575
00:59:34,183 --> 00:59:41,851
My heart is thrilled...
as she showers her beauty...

576
00:59:42,024 --> 00:59:57,236
lf l smile beautifully,
it's a rain of fire...

577
00:59:57,573 --> 01:00:00,872
The life of life will
not come back...

578
01:00:01,043 --> 01:00:04,911
Sky has come down...
earth is flooding...

579
01:00:05,080 --> 01:00:08,641
This chill weather is
warming our hearts...

580
01:00:08,817 --> 01:00:12,253
Don't hold umbrella
and stop the rain...

581
01:00:12,588 --> 01:00:16,388
Don't try to impound my heart
with a dam...

582
01:00:16,725 --> 01:00:21,094
Have a blast...
enjoy the rain...

583
01:00:48,355 --> 01:00:52,018
Look at the car!
Back door is open.

584
01:00:53,059 --> 01:00:56,859
Go fast, let's tell them.
May be wife and kids are sitting back.

585
01:00:57,030 --> 01:00:59,692
Yes madam...yes...

586
01:01:00,533 --> 01:01:03,366
Go fast, why are you watching
my face? Go!

587
01:01:29,696 --> 01:01:32,062
What happened?
- Stop the car.

588
01:01:36,870 --> 01:01:38,895
Brother! That girl!

589
01:01:49,983 --> 01:01:50,915
Watch out!

590
01:02:24,884 --> 01:02:27,045
Why are you laughing now?

591
01:02:28,988 --> 01:02:31,957
You went to tell your tormentor
to close the door.

592
01:02:32,125 --> 01:02:34,218
They would've closed us forever.

593
01:02:34,694 --> 01:02:38,130
You're laughing,
they'll not spare us.

594
01:02:38,465 --> 01:02:39,989
l'm scared.

595
01:02:40,166 --> 01:02:42,157
Why are you getting scared?
l'm there for you.

596
01:02:42,502 --> 01:02:44,129
What will you do?

597
01:02:47,774 --> 01:02:48,968
Change the route.

598
01:02:55,248 --> 01:02:59,082
lt's me! Just now l saw...

599
01:03:35,955 --> 01:03:39,186
Shiva, look behind.
l think we've company.

600
01:03:39,793 --> 01:03:41,021
What?
- Yes Shiva.

601
01:03:41,194 --> 01:03:42,684
Go fast!

602
01:03:48,601 --> 01:03:49,863
Shiva, go fast.

603
01:03:50,036 --> 01:03:50,934
Go fast!

604
01:03:52,205 --> 01:03:54,696
Go...go...
- They have neared us.

605
01:03:56,176 --> 01:03:57,871
Go faster!

606
01:04:03,016 --> 01:04:06,281
Go...go...you go...
you go to the front...

607
01:04:07,787 --> 01:04:09,345
Go fast.
- Keep quiet please.

608
01:04:11,224 --> 01:04:13,283
This is not yours, this is my trouble.

609
01:04:13,960 --> 01:04:16,224
They are not after you,
they are after me.

610
01:04:25,171 --> 01:04:27,230
Go, don't spare him.

611
01:04:29,776 --> 01:04:31,243
Go...go fast...

612
01:04:50,063 --> 01:04:52,361
Push him with the car...
push him...

613
01:04:59,672 --> 01:05:03,267
Get down the road,
don't spare him today. Chase him.

614
01:06:01,701 --> 01:06:03,168
Catch him!

615
01:07:18,077 --> 01:07:20,409
Let anything may happen,
don't get down from the car.

616
01:08:23,142 --> 01:08:25,872
You bloody!
You put a mark on my face.

617
01:08:26,045 --> 01:08:28,570
Watch out! How many marks
l'll put on your face!

618
01:08:28,915 --> 01:08:29,973
You can't even count them.

619
01:08:30,149 --> 01:08:33,209
Let me see how you will
escape from me today.

620
01:10:22,728 --> 01:10:26,095
Go...stop the game with this.

621
01:10:26,365 --> 01:10:31,428
Next time if l see you again,
l'll not leave you half dead like this.

622
01:11:13,613 --> 01:11:16,343
Who are they?

623
01:11:17,283 --> 01:11:18,773
Why are they after you?

624
01:11:19,352 --> 01:11:24,312
You said you've relatives in Bombay,
l've enemies there.

625
01:11:25,625 --> 01:11:26,990
l didn't get you.

626
01:11:27,293 --> 01:11:28,988
You will get to know slowly.

627
01:11:48,347 --> 01:11:52,215
What's the problem?
Why are they after you?

628
01:11:52,385 --> 01:11:53,682
Who are they?

629
01:11:58,024 --> 01:12:02,188
l thought people were after me,
why are they after you also?

630
01:12:04,130 --> 01:12:07,531
Nothing big as you think,
just a small problem.

631
01:12:07,800 --> 01:12:09,358
Problem?

632
01:12:09,735 --> 01:12:11,362
l went to Bombay to
attend an interview.

633
01:12:27,404 --> 01:12:29,599
Just now came, waiting for the car.

634
01:12:30,006 --> 01:12:33,601
What are you doing?
You think l'm weak, l'll punch you...

635
01:12:33,777 --> 01:12:34,937
Go...go...
- Go?

636
01:12:35,278 --> 01:12:39,009
My friend is coming if not
l'll take you to task. You go man.

637
01:12:39,349 --> 01:12:41,817
Why are you staring at me?

638
01:12:41,985 --> 01:12:45,284
lf l get you, you're finished.
Looking at me...hey...

639
01:12:46,456 --> 01:12:49,721
How are you?
- l'm fine...l'm fine.

640
01:12:49,893 --> 01:12:54,296
You're raising a hell.
- lf not people will not listen, get in.

641
01:12:58,835 --> 01:13:00,462
What's the problem there?

642
01:13:00,637 --> 01:13:03,435
A man hit my car from wrong
side and created problem,

643
01:13:03,607 --> 01:13:04,539
thank God, you came.

644
01:13:04,708 --> 01:13:06,471
He escaped if not he would be dead.

645
01:13:06,643 --> 01:13:08,702
lf we get scared of them,
we can't live here.

646
01:13:08,879 --> 01:13:11,347
Bombay people dread people of Hyderabad.

647
01:13:11,514 --> 01:13:15,041
Last week too had problem,
l just gave a punch.

648
01:13:15,385 --> 01:13:17,853
Ours must be the
first punch in Bombay.

649
01:13:18,021 --> 01:13:19,989
Only then they will listen to us.

650
01:13:21,992 --> 01:13:27,862
Why are you putting up
shop on road? Bloody idiot!

651
01:13:28,031 --> 01:13:32,832
Buddy! My name is a terror
in this area.

652
01:13:36,673 --> 01:13:39,540
How is my area?
- Okay, no problem.

653
01:13:39,709 --> 01:13:42,507
This is best place and
you say just okay.

654
01:13:42,679 --> 01:13:44,340
Look at that aunt selling fruits.

655
01:13:44,514 --> 01:13:47,415
Where's your husband? ln jail?

656
01:13:47,584 --> 01:13:49,882
Matunga police station?
l'll take care of him.

657
01:13:50,053 --> 01:13:50,678
What?

658
01:13:50,854 --> 01:13:53,550
You're speaking about police case.
- Lots of issues.

659
01:13:53,723 --> 01:13:57,056
She has been crying for four days,
police took her second husband.

660
01:13:57,394 --> 01:13:58,383
l took up the matter.

661
01:13:58,561 --> 01:14:01,553
Just one word and
Sl saluted me and sent a man.

662
01:14:01,731 --> 01:14:06,031
He fell on my feet to save his life.

663
01:14:06,369 --> 01:14:09,736
You're lucky to see me free today.

664
01:14:09,906 --> 01:14:12,397
Generally, l'm very busy.

665
01:14:12,575 --> 01:14:15,476
Okay, when is your interview?
- Tomorrow morning 9 am.

666
01:14:15,645 --> 01:14:20,844
No problem, you get everything from
vegetarian to non-vegetarian food.

667
01:14:21,017 --> 01:14:23,110
You have food and take rest.
Okay?

668
01:14:25,689 --> 01:14:29,125
Why are you calling me
so many times?

669
01:14:29,459 --> 01:14:31,086
A small problem,
l'll settle it and come.

670
01:14:31,428 --> 01:14:35,057
What's this nonsense?
l'm coming...

671
01:15:00,123 --> 01:15:03,923
l'm in an important meeting.
Call me later.

672
01:15:04,594 --> 01:15:08,690
You've killed two people outside,
l'll look after the cases.

673
01:15:08,865 --> 01:15:11,766
But it's difficult to hit the man inside.

674
01:15:11,935 --> 01:15:13,960
Everybody is watching me.

675
01:15:14,137 --> 01:15:16,628
l can't help you in this matter.

676
01:15:16,806 --> 01:15:19,775
Press, media glare is on this case.

677
01:15:19,943 --> 01:15:23,777
lf l do anything,
it may go against you.

678
01:15:25,015 --> 01:15:27,540
Very happy to hear your words.

679
01:15:27,717 --> 01:15:29,207
You're right.

680
01:15:29,552 --> 01:15:32,680
Look! How those birds flew
for a small sound.

681
01:15:32,856 --> 01:15:35,654
You want me also to
fly away like birds.

682
01:15:35,825 --> 01:15:38,191
He has been working with me
for 12 long years,

683
01:15:38,528 --> 01:15:39,927
he knows everything about me,

684
01:15:40,096 --> 01:15:43,793
if he opens up against me
even once, that's it!

685
01:15:44,734 --> 01:15:45,962
Are you happy?

686
01:15:46,569 --> 01:15:49,163
What are you saying man?
We engaged you for that purpose only.

687
01:15:49,506 --> 01:15:51,201
You say can't do, impossible,
how can you say it?

688
01:15:51,541 --> 01:15:54,135
Let me finish it,
there's only one way out.

689
01:15:54,477 --> 01:15:57,241
Tell anyone of your men
to hurt someone in public,

690
01:15:57,580 --> 01:15:59,673
and go to jail in that case,

691
01:15:59,849 --> 01:16:02,215
tell him to finish him in jail
and walk out.

692
01:16:02,552 --> 01:16:04,144
Nobody will suspect anything.

693
01:16:04,487 --> 01:16:06,978
Have you understood his plan?

694
01:16:08,758 --> 01:16:13,661
Why did you beat around the bush
instead of telling this straight?

695
01:16:14,230 --> 01:16:16,994
Good! Everything will be alright.

696
01:19:00,997 --> 01:19:04,660
ls it him?
- No. Go and see there.

697
01:19:06,402 --> 01:19:08,427
l didn't see anything sir.

698
01:19:10,106 --> 01:19:11,334
l don't know.
l don't know sir.

699
01:19:11,674 --> 01:19:14,165
l didn't see anything sir.

700
01:19:14,744 --> 01:19:16,268
Do you know? Tell me.

701
01:19:18,681 --> 01:19:22,344
Go...stop...stop the car...

702
01:19:22,685 --> 01:19:24,209
Come out.
- Brother...

703
01:19:24,387 --> 01:19:28,847
My house is there.
- Go...go..

704
01:19:33,763 --> 01:19:35,424
What's the problem?
- Bali's goons.

705
01:19:36,499 --> 01:19:37,989
lt's a battle going on outside.

706
01:19:38,167 --> 01:19:41,762
lt seems someone had
beaten up Bali's men.

707
01:19:41,938 --> 01:19:45,237
Today he's finished.
Combing the area.

708
01:19:45,408 --> 01:19:47,774
Kill him on finding him.

709
01:19:47,944 --> 01:19:49,172
Don't know who beat them.

710
01:19:49,345 --> 01:19:52,746
lt was none other than me.

711
01:19:52,915 --> 01:19:54,883
No jokes please.

712
01:19:55,051 --> 01:19:56,951
You too have started talking like me.

713
01:19:57,120 --> 01:19:59,054
Just a minute.
- What?

714
01:19:59,222 --> 01:20:00,780
Don't open that door.

715
01:20:01,057 --> 01:20:03,150
Someone followed me, l beat him up.

716
01:20:03,326 --> 01:20:07,729
Enough man!
Big boast!

717
01:20:12,935 --> 01:20:14,994
What's this?

718
01:20:15,171 --> 01:20:17,196
Did you really beat him?
Why did you fight with them?

719
01:20:17,373 --> 01:20:19,500
You told me ours must be
first punch in Bombay.

720
01:20:19,842 --> 01:20:23,334
l said it for fun only.
Will you follow it as rule?

721
01:20:23,513 --> 01:20:26,880
City is on fire outside,
you're sitting calmly here.

722
01:20:27,050 --> 01:20:29,951
Get out from here fast,
if they see you, you're finished.

723
01:20:30,119 --> 01:20:31,484
Where is your bag?

724
01:20:32,255 --> 01:20:35,554
Why are you shivering?
- What are you saying man?

725
01:20:35,892 --> 01:20:36,916
Do you know who is Bali?

726
01:20:37,093 --> 01:20:39,186
Do you know his power in Bombay?
Can't you understand if l tell?

727
01:20:39,362 --> 01:20:40,294
Wait.

728
01:20:40,463 --> 01:20:45,332
Come...come...get going...
- Why are you rushing?

729
01:20:45,501 --> 01:20:49,437
Come quietly. Not this side,
let's go from back.

730
01:20:50,623 --> 01:20:53,183
l was out for just few hours
and you've done so much.

731
01:20:53,359 --> 01:20:55,850
Come...get into the car fast.

732
01:20:59,899 --> 01:21:02,265
Bend down, somebody may see you.

733
01:21:06,272 --> 01:21:09,605
Don't spare anyone,
take him to boss.

734
01:21:10,276 --> 01:21:11,800
Thrash the bastard!

735
01:21:19,218 --> 01:21:20,549
They are taking someone else
mistaking him for me.

736
01:21:20,719 --> 01:21:22,687
Problem is solved, leave it.

737
01:21:22,855 --> 01:21:24,755
Why should he get
caught unnecessarily?

738
01:21:24,924 --> 01:21:26,755
Shut up, don't talk about justice
like Mahatma Gandhi.

739
01:21:26,926 --> 01:21:28,223
Stop the car.

740
01:21:28,394 --> 01:21:29,759
Bring him...bring him.

741
01:21:29,929 --> 01:21:33,228
Boss, we caught him,
he's the guy.

742
01:21:33,399 --> 01:21:35,890
Don't leave him, boss.

743
01:21:36,235 --> 01:21:37,725
Stop the car l say.

744
01:21:37,903 --> 01:21:39,894
Stop it.

745
01:21:42,942 --> 01:21:45,672
l saw him beating our men.

746
01:21:45,844 --> 01:21:48,574
Boss, don't spare him.
Bury him alive, boss.

747
01:21:48,747 --> 01:21:52,581
Don't spare him alive, boss.

748
01:21:52,751 --> 01:21:53,911
Hello, one minute.

749
01:21:55,588 --> 01:21:58,614
He didn't beat your men,
he's not connected with it.

750
01:21:59,758 --> 01:22:00,782
l beat your men.

751
01:22:00,960 --> 01:22:05,920
He's not that man...
he's not that man, boss.

752
01:22:06,265 --> 01:22:09,826
He's the man, don't think, kill him.

753
01:22:10,002 --> 01:22:11,435
Boss...

754
01:22:16,742 --> 01:22:20,007
Trying to become a hero.
How dare!

755
01:22:20,546 --> 01:22:25,609
You accept in public that
you beat my men.

756
01:22:25,784 --> 01:22:27,445
You know who l am?

757
01:22:28,420 --> 01:22:29,910
Where are you coming from?

758
01:22:31,023 --> 01:22:33,014
Tell him, who l am.

759
01:22:33,359 --> 01:22:36,021
Who so ever you may be,
that's not a problem to me.

760
01:22:36,362 --> 01:22:38,557
Your man beat me,
unnecessarily attacked me.

761
01:22:38,731 --> 01:22:40,028
So l retaliated.

762
01:22:42,334 --> 01:22:45,531
Will you retaliate if he touches you?
Will you?

763
01:22:45,704 --> 01:22:47,069
l'll touch you now.

764
01:22:47,406 --> 01:22:51,570
He's innocent, forgive him.
- Come on beat me.

765
01:22:51,744 --> 01:22:54,508
Sir, he has come to attend
an interview.

766
01:22:54,680 --> 01:22:56,671
Please forgive him.
- Will you beat me also?

767
01:22:56,849 --> 01:22:59,977
Please forgive him sir...
- Come on beat me.

768
01:23:00,319 --> 01:23:02,879
Come on beat me; you bloody.
- Forgive him Bali sir.

769
01:23:03,055 --> 01:23:04,818
Beat me!

770
01:23:30,082 --> 01:23:31,845
Come, Shiva!

771
01:25:39,912 --> 01:25:42,972
Come...come...

772
01:25:43,148 --> 01:25:44,206
Come.

773
01:26:12,110 --> 01:26:15,170
Have you gone mad?
Created a big problem in one day.

774
01:26:15,514 --> 01:26:20,144
l'm confused, Oh God!
You've finished me here.

775
01:26:20,319 --> 01:26:22,048
No use in feeling now, forget it.

776
01:26:22,221 --> 01:26:24,246
lf l return without attending interview,
father will shout at me.

777
01:26:24,590 --> 01:26:27,150
Look at him! ls attending
interview more important?

778
01:26:27,326 --> 01:26:29,624
We are running for lives and
you want to attend interview.

779
01:26:29,795 --> 01:26:33,060
Never again come to Bombay,
stay away from it all your life.

780
01:26:33,232 --> 01:26:34,722
l would've lost my life too.

781
01:26:34,900 --> 01:26:36,333
No, l don't want to have
anything with you.

782
01:26:50,282 --> 01:26:54,218
Why did you come with me
if you've a problem here?

783
01:26:54,720 --> 01:26:58,281
Have you forgotten it?
You were in tears while asking me.

784
01:26:58,624 --> 01:27:00,216
lf l could drop you in Bombay.

785
01:27:00,826 --> 01:27:02,817
What can a man do in
such situation?

786
01:27:03,262 --> 01:27:04,854
l didn't think about
my personal problem.

787
01:27:05,030 --> 01:27:09,091
You go back from here, if they see
you again, we'll be in trouble.

788
01:27:09,268 --> 01:27:13,728
You go back. l'll catch
some other vehicle to Bombay.

789
01:27:13,906 --> 01:27:15,567
l can't leave you midway.

790
01:27:15,741 --> 01:27:18,767
Not like that...
- Don't you trust me?

791
01:27:18,944 --> 01:27:21,742
Trust...
- Scared?

792
01:27:23,282 --> 01:27:24,909
Not scared...

793
01:27:25,083 --> 01:27:27,074
Then, come and sit in car.

794
01:28:13,173 --> 01:28:14,333
What happened?

795
01:28:15,876 --> 01:28:17,173
Look there!

796
01:28:22,916 --> 01:28:25,942
What are you going to do now?

797
01:28:27,888 --> 01:28:30,584
Give your hand bag.
Please give me.

798
01:28:30,891 --> 01:28:31,823
Why?

799
01:29:11,832 --> 01:29:13,026
Drive the car.

800
01:29:13,667 --> 01:29:15,692
They only know me.
They don't know you.

801
01:29:15,869 --> 01:29:17,393
l'll walk down, you come.

802
01:29:52,072 --> 01:29:57,442
He looks similar,
but if l tell l may get slapped. No way.

803
01:30:08,422 --> 01:30:11,016
Check every car thoroughly.

804
01:30:29,910 --> 01:30:30,968
What happened?

805
01:30:32,479 --> 01:30:33,810
Look there!

806
01:31:36,376 --> 01:31:38,776
Hey that girl!

807
01:31:39,379 --> 01:31:40,107
Come!

808
01:31:41,381 --> 01:31:42,871
Come on boys!

809
01:31:43,116 --> 01:31:45,141
Shiva, they've seen me. Go fast.

810
01:31:45,852 --> 01:31:49,015
Hey stop!

811
01:32:04,137 --> 01:32:05,570
They have come closer.

812
01:34:09,196 --> 01:34:10,788
They are gone.
- Keep quiet.

813
01:34:23,243 --> 01:34:25,734
He's not here, get the vehicle.

814
01:34:25,912 --> 01:34:28,039
Hey, get the vehicles.

815
01:34:56,877 --> 01:34:59,072
We've reached Bombay.

816
01:34:59,312 --> 01:35:00,745
Where do you want to go?

817
01:35:01,148 --> 01:35:02,740
GP Rajan road.

818
01:35:05,085 --> 01:35:05,983
What?

819
01:35:06,153 --> 01:35:08,383
GP Rajan road?
- Go straight and turn left.

820
01:35:18,865 --> 01:35:22,323
Oh this is it?
Have you come here before?

821
01:35:22,669 --> 01:35:24,398
No, this is my first visit.

01:35:27,174 --> 01:35:30,632
Do you've number?
- No, let's inquire.

824
01:35:30,811 --> 01:35:34,076
How can we inquire in such a big city
without phone or door number?

825
01:35:34,247 --> 01:35:36,374
Mother told me if you ask
anyone they'll guide us.

826
01:35:36,716 --> 01:35:39,810
This is childishness.
- No, not as you think.

827
01:35:39,986 --> 01:35:43,114
GPR is my grandpa,
this road is named after him.

830
01:35:53,667 --> 01:35:56,101
l saw a bhel puri push cart
with GP Rajan's name.

831
01:35:56,269 --> 01:35:59,363
Road is on his name, he won't have
come down to so low level.

832
01:35:59,706 --> 01:36:00,900
Certainly not.

833
01:36:05,178 --> 01:36:07,408
Definitely not.

834

Let's ask him.

835

Not him, let's ask in the
shop next to him.- Okay.

836
01:36:12,786 --> 01:36:14,720
Brother, GP Rajan

837
01:36:14,888 --> 01:36:17,448
Raju bhai...someone's here for you.

838
01:36:17,791 --> 01:36:19,884
l was asking about the owner of
GP Rajan group of companies.

839
01:36:20,060 --> 01:36:21,857
One minute.
Take this.

840

Go and ask in that building.
You will know it.

842
01:36:30,270 --> 01:36:33,671

Oh no! lt's not me!

849
01:38:01,331 --> 01:38:02,992
Brother, a soda please.

850
01:38:12,575 --> 01:38:14,634
Why did you come to Bombay?

851
01:38:14,811 --> 01:38:17,473
About a small job.
- Job again?

852
01:38:17,647 --> 01:38:18,773
Not for me.

853
01:38:21,451 --> 01:38:23,783
What's this new set up?

Original?
When did you grow so much hair?

855
01:38:26,356 --> 01:38:29,052
From the day you created
trouble for me here.

856
01:38:29,392 --> 01:38:33,522
l'm on streets changing my style
and with my broken Hindi.

857
01:38:33,696 --> 01:38:35,755
Whatever it is, let's go home
and discuss, brother.

858
01:38:35,932 --> 01:38:39,459
We'll be in trouble if anyone
of the group sees on road.

859
01:38:39,636 --> 01:38:41,968
Two groups?
- Why are you asking newly?

860
01:38:42,305 --> 01:38:43,670
Andhra group that is after me,

861
01:38:43,840 --> 01:38:45,307
Bombay group which
is after him already.

862
01:38:45,475 --> 01:38:47,340
lt makes two, right?

863
01:38:47,510 --> 01:38:49,307
Good development.

864
01:38:49,479 --> 01:38:51,003
Are you creating more
troubles in different states?

865
01:38:51,347 --> 01:38:53,042
Take this, l'm going.

866
01:38:53,383 --> 01:38:54,315
Why are you leaving me on road?

867
01:38:54,484 --> 01:38:55,712
Where did you leave me earlier?

868
01:38:55,885 --> 01:38:57,512
Did you leave me in a star hotel room?

869
01:38:57,687 --> 01:38:58,676
Don't play, let's go home.

870
01:38:58,855 --> 01:39:01,983
No...no...l sleep here, bath there.

871
01:39:02,325 --> 01:39:04,759
No home, no ration card.
Care of platform.

872
01:39:04,928 --> 01:39:07,488
Brother, need keys to keep
water inside.

873
01:39:08,331 --> 01:39:09,730
Give me the keys fast.

874
01:39:10,900 --> 01:39:12,834
He's asking keys at the right time.

875
01:39:13,803 --> 01:39:17,864
Brother, he's calling you,
he wants keys to keep water inside.

876
01:39:18,041 --> 01:39:21,477
Do you know Hindi too, sister?
- That's Marathi not Hindi.

877
01:39:21,644 --> 01:39:23,134
l think she watches all the channels.

878
01:39:23,479 --> 01:39:25,845
ls your home here only?

879
01:39:26,015 --> 01:39:28,677
l thought we may have to go around,
but he has brought us to home only.

880
01:39:28,852 --> 01:39:32,049
He's always playful from childhood.
Take it.

881
01:39:32,388 --> 01:39:33,514
Come, let's go up.

882
01:39:33,890 --> 01:39:34,720
Pay for it.

883
01:39:34,891 --> 01:39:37,018
Where are you going?
- Come fast.

884
01:39:37,994 --> 01:39:39,894
He told about water and
showed my home.

885
01:39:40,063 --> 01:39:43,032
l'm feeling giddy already.
Don't know what's going to happen?

886
01:39:43,366 --> 01:39:46,858
Why did you come home straight
going all around? Why?

887
01:39:47,036 --> 01:39:49,368
Come quickly with the keys.

888
01:39:50,840 --> 01:39:54,037
Don't drop it down,
guitar may break.

889
01:39:58,047 --> 01:40:00,413
That's guitar bag not a carry bag.

890
01:40:00,583 --> 01:40:03,450
Fridge isn't cooling.
- That's not a fridge at all.

891
01:40:03,620 --> 01:40:06,384
Don't beat around the bush, straight to
the point, why are you here?

892
01:40:06,556 --> 01:40:07,989
Nothing buddy...

893
01:40:09,025 --> 01:40:10,549
Just have to find an address, that's all.

894
01:40:10,727 --> 01:40:11,819
What's the address?

895
01:40:11,995 --> 01:40:13,986
lt's not detailed.

896
01:40:14,464 --> 01:40:16,125
Even if it's not, tell me.

897
01:40:16,466 --> 01:40:21,733

That's it.

01:40:31,881 --> 01:40:33,746
No, tell me the address again.

903
01:40:33,917 --> 01:40:36,078
Rajan Group of Companies, Bombay.

904
01:40:36,452 --> 01:40:39,080
Rajan Group of Companies, Bombay.
There are so many details.

905
01:40:39,422 --> 01:40:40,719

906
01:40:40,890 --> 01:40:43,051
Didn't l tell you? He's my friend,
he'll give life for me.

907
01:40:43,226 --> 01:40:46,923
lf he's stays for two days,
he'll take life also.

908
01:40:53,154 --> 01:40:54,621
Why are you after him?

909
01:40:54,922 --> 01:40:58,187
Not the guy, we want that girl.
- Why?

910
01:40:58,359 --> 01:41:00,657
She was about to marry,
she ran away, bloody bitch.

911
01:41:00,828 --> 01:41:07,461
Okay, you take the girl,
but we'll kill that guy.

912
01:41:12,373 --> 01:41:13,533
What's that mark?

913
01:41:18,145 --> 01:41:21,637
How did it happen?
- That...l fell down.- How?

914
01:41:23,417 --> 01:41:24,782
l slipped in bathroom.

915
01:41:32,493 --> 01:41:34,654
Priya! We've reached Bombay.

916
01:41:34,829 --> 01:41:37,593
Couldn't find the address,
staying with a friend.

917
01:41:37,765 --> 01:41:39,630
He has gone out to find the address.

918
01:41:39,800 --> 01:41:43,167
Don't know how long will l be with her?
But l'm very happy.

919
01:41:43,337 --> 01:41:45,305
l think...
- What's it?

920
01:41:45,473 --> 01:41:50,376
She'll say don't find that address,
l like you, l'll come with you.

921
01:41:50,544 --> 01:41:51,374
Really?

922
01:41:51,545 --> 01:41:57,506
Will your friend find the address?

923
01:42:19,638 --> 01:42:23,665
l don't want a place in your heart...

924
01:42:23,842 --> 01:42:27,869
Don't seek a place in my heart...

925
01:42:28,314 --> 01:42:31,215
Don't give place to love in our hearts...

926
01:42:31,383 --> 01:42:36,753
These words are not from heart...

927
01:42:37,156 --> 01:42:41,354
l don't wish to be your shadow...

928
01:42:41,527 --> 01:42:45,691
l don't yearn to be your partner...

929
01:42:45,864 --> 01:42:48,697
Let my love go away with you...

930
01:42:48,867 --> 01:42:52,359
l can't lie like this...

931
01:42:52,538 --> 01:43:01,207
Your companionship has made
my summers into rainy season...

932
01:43:01,380 --> 01:43:11,517
ln your dreams, my love will
reach it's shore...

933
01:43:59,872 --> 01:44:07,574
My heart rocks for your
talk and gestures...

934
01:44:08,580 --> 01:44:16,988
My soul is charmed by
your sweet song...

935
01:44:17,790 --> 01:44:21,920
Once love hit my eyes...

936
01:44:22,261 --> 01:44:25,458
lt has started seeing stealthily...

937
01:44:25,631 --> 01:44:29,795
Little drama...little reality...

938
01:44:29,968 --> 01:44:33,426
This love game is exciting...

939
01:44:33,605 --> 01:44:37,735
When you spread the net...

940
01:44:37,910 --> 01:44:42,074
My heart fell into it and
my life changed...

941
01:44:42,414 --> 01:44:46,475
This is new feeling of hurt...

942
01:44:46,652 --> 01:44:52,284
As it grows, it's your friendship...

943
01:45:10,008 --> 01:45:18,473
Look at me for a second silently...
it'll become a eon...

944
01:45:18,884 --> 01:45:27,087
lmprison me in your eyes...
l'll be happy in it...

945
01:45:28,026 --> 01:45:35,797
When l see you...a thousand
desires melt away...

946
01:45:35,968 --> 01:45:43,704
Like a child my eyes are
jumping on seeing you...

947
01:45:43,876 --> 01:45:52,409
The morning horizon's red
is your vermillion...

948
01:45:52,584 --> 01:46:02,016
The dusk red sky is the hibiscus
in your tresses...

949
01:46:45,656 --> 01:46:47,123
Still in home?

950
01:46:47,291 --> 01:46:48,519
We are waiting for you only.

951
01:46:48,693 --> 01:46:50,558
l'm waiting for you to leave.

952
01:46:50,728 --> 01:46:51,660
Why are you saying like this?

953
01:46:51,829 --> 01:46:52,591
l'm like that only.

954
01:46:52,764 --> 01:46:54,732
l can see everything happening
in my home,

955
01:46:55,066 --> 01:46:56,556
if you come out, l'll walk in.

956
01:46:56,734 --> 01:46:59,532
Whatever it is cell to cell,
phone to phone only.

957
01:47:01,239 --> 01:47:02,206
Okay.

958
01:47:02,707 --> 01:47:03,696
Let's go.

959
01:47:14,552 --> 01:47:15,746
Do you've entry pass?

960
01:47:16,087 --> 01:47:18,715
Stop...stop... Stop that car.

961
01:47:20,758 --> 01:47:22,225
Why are you barging in?

962
01:47:22,393 --> 01:47:24,588
You were stopped there, right?
Why did you come in?

963
01:47:24,762 --> 01:47:26,059
l'm their relative.
- Whose relative?

964
01:47:26,230 --> 01:47:27,094
l'm here to meet them.

965
01:47:27,265 --> 01:47:29,563
Okay, pull over the this side.
Pull over to the side.

966
01:47:32,270 --> 01:47:33,396
Stop here.

967
01:47:37,241 --> 01:47:39,869
Go ahead.
- She's from their family.

968
01:47:40,511 --> 01:47:42,103
She's Saradamma's grand daughter.

969
01:47:42,280 --> 01:47:43,542
Can't understand what he's saying?
- You tell him

970
01:47:43,714 --> 01:47:45,875
l'm coming from Chennai.
l'm Saradamma's grand daughter.

971
01:47:46,217 --> 01:47:48,344
l want to meet her, so l'm here.

972
01:47:48,519 --> 01:47:50,077
Okay, l'll inform and come.

973
01:47:50,254 --> 01:47:53,781
But you must know
how you barged in.- Okay go.

974
01:47:54,125 --> 01:47:56,593
Keep an eye. l'm going in.
- Okay sir.

975
01:48:03,167 --> 01:48:03,861
Two people have come
from Andhra,

976
01:48:04,202 --> 01:48:06,295
one of them says she's
madam's grand daughter.

977
01:48:06,470 --> 01:48:09,837
lf you permit me l'll bring them.
- l'll inform madam. Wait here.

978
01:48:18,115 --> 01:48:20,276
Looks like a wedding.

979
01:48:21,652 --> 01:48:23,415
The skinhead is coming.
- l told you wait outside.

980
01:48:23,588 --> 01:48:24,486
He's asking something,
manage him.

981
01:48:24,655 --> 01:48:27,556
We should waited outside.
- We've already come in, leave it.

982
01:48:27,725 --> 01:48:29,693
l'm asking you,
why are you not answering me?

983
01:48:29,861 --> 01:48:32,853
Go out...go...get out.
- Let them in.

984
01:48:55,519 --> 01:48:57,749
lsn't she just like my Janu?

985
01:49:00,858 --> 01:49:02,325
Come in dear.

986
01:50:38,022 --> 01:50:40,422
l came here fearing.

987
01:50:42,426 --> 01:50:45,327
l didn't expect this.
They are showering love on me.

988
01:50:45,496 --> 01:50:47,589
l must thank you for everything.

989
01:50:47,832 --> 01:50:50,062
No need of that, please take this.

990
01:50:53,637 --> 01:50:56,697
Then...?
- Then...

991
01:50:56,974 --> 01:51:00,432
Charu, grandma is calling you.
- Coming.

992
01:51:01,645 --> 01:51:03,772
Wait, l'll be back in a sec.

993
01:51:18,329 --> 01:51:18,795
Raj, come here!

994
01:51:24,582 --> 01:51:28,245
A calamity invited me...

995
01:51:28,419 --> 01:51:32,116
Dreams walked out off the eyes...

996
01:51:32,289 --> 01:51:35,952
lf everything around me
turns into a play...

997
01:51:36,127 --> 01:51:39,927
lf l leave the stage without
knowing to act...

998
01:51:40,097 --> 01:51:47,435
Time moves leaving me behind...
ls it going away with you?

999
01:51:47,605 --> 01:51:55,171
As dawn breaks, moonbeam
will leave the sky...

1000
01:51:55,346 --> 01:52:02,684
You gave new life to my heart
with your memories...

1001
01:52:03,020 --> 01:52:11,951
l'm going away from you
leaving my heart behind...

1002
01:52:25,476 --> 01:52:33,178
l've turned myself into you...
now l'm left without an identity...

1003
01:52:33,350 --> 01:52:36,751
Without knowing where to go
and what to do...

1004
01:52:37,088 --> 01:52:40,319
l'm waiting for you...

1005
01:52:40,491 --> 01:52:48,091
Your entry had made my days
forget about nights...

1006
01:52:48,265 --> 01:52:56,036
Without you living or dead
is same to me...

1007
01:52:56,207 --> 01:53:03,704
Future without you
can't stop my tears, O my love...

1008
01:53:04,048 --> 01:53:12,183
You've just become a memory....
is that all you to me?

1009
01:54:33,168 --> 01:54:36,433
Where are you, Shiva?
- On road.

1010
01:54:36,605 --> 01:54:38,470
She?
- Her home.

1011
01:54:38,640 --> 01:54:43,373
What happened?
- lt's all over. Curtains down.

1012
01:54:43,545 --> 01:54:46,446
Found the address,
she went to her people.

1013
01:54:46,615 --> 01:54:49,015
Did you tell her?
What was her reaction?

1014
01:54:49,184 --> 01:54:51,482
She thanked profoundly for everything.

1015
01:54:51,653 --> 01:54:52,984
Didn't she tell anything else?

1016
01:54:53,155 --> 01:54:56,249
What else can she say?
That's all she told.

1017
01:54:56,491 --> 01:55:00,120
On the whole they were very happy.

1018
01:55:00,762 --> 01:55:03,230
l don't know why was
l standing there.

1019
01:55:03,498 --> 01:55:07,366
l felt my job there is over.
That's why l left.

1020
01:55:09,671 --> 01:55:13,698
l drove from Bangalore to Bombay,
l never felt the distance.

1021
01:55:14,309 --> 01:55:16,641
But now l've just reached the road
leaving her at home,

1022
01:55:16,979 --> 01:55:18,776
this seems very long, Priya.

1023
01:55:19,381 --> 01:55:21,144
Tears in my eyes.

1024
01:55:21,683 --> 01:55:25,619
Nothing will happen as you think.
Be brave.

1025
01:55:27,556 --> 01:55:31,151
He's saying something,
please talk to him.

1026
01:55:31,326 --> 01:55:33,988
Shiva, it's me, Anand.
What happened?

1027
01:55:34,262 --> 01:55:38,392
l'm in traffic, will call you later.

1028
01:56:33,221 --> 01:56:37,521
Haven't you gone yet?
Still roaming in Bombay?

1029
01:56:37,692 --> 01:56:39,057
ls your problem solved?

1030
01:56:39,227 --> 01:56:42,492
Do you want any help from my uncle?

1031
01:56:44,366 --> 01:56:47,267
Purchase...entire family is up there.

1032
01:56:47,436 --> 01:56:48,403
Suddenly they brought me here.

1033
01:56:48,570 --> 01:56:52,097
Everyone is choosing things for me.
l was getting suffocated.

1034
01:56:52,274 --> 01:56:54,834
You saw me there, right?
How they welcomed me!

1035
01:56:55,177 --> 01:57:00,740
Won't we feel shy to select
so many things at a time?

1036
01:57:01,750 --> 01:57:03,877
That's why l'm standing here.

1037
01:57:05,487 --> 01:57:08,820
Nice car, you know?
Not a little jerk too. Really!

1038
01:57:09,157 --> 01:57:13,787
They quote high rate while purchasing,
they offer low rates when we sell.

1039
01:57:14,129 --> 01:57:16,120
Got this much only for
your bangles.

1040
01:57:16,298 --> 01:57:18,425
Keep it with you, it's for you only.

1041
01:57:19,101 --> 01:57:24,664
l've a new life, he's a watchman.
l gave him my old bangles.

1042
01:57:24,840 --> 01:57:26,808
He sold them off and
giving me the money.

1043
01:57:27,142 --> 01:57:29,633
You said you don't have money
for train and bus ticket.

1044
01:57:29,811 --> 01:57:31,779
And my sought my help
to sell these bangles.

1045
01:57:32,114 --> 01:57:34,207
l don't want your money, take it.

1046
01:57:34,382 --> 01:57:37,112
Hard earned money is
not helping me...

1047
01:57:48,163 --> 01:57:49,460
Did it come all of a sudden?

1048
01:57:49,631 --> 01:57:51,189
You all are so affectionate on her.

1049
01:57:51,366 --> 01:57:52,765
Runaway girl's runaway daughter.

1050
01:57:52,934 --> 01:57:54,663
Her mother walked out on us.

1051
01:57:54,836 --> 01:57:56,463
lt appears like had happened just now.

1052
01:57:56,638 --> 01:57:57,764
Just now able to raise the head.

1053
01:57:57,939 --> 01:57:59,600
Shouldn't we ever raise our heads?

1054
01:57:59,774 --> 01:58:02,470
She has come all the way from there
to spoil our peace and happiness.

1055
01:58:02,644 --> 01:58:03,838
Same running away tendencies.

1056
01:58:04,179 --> 01:58:06,306
Her mother ditched all of us.

1057
01:58:06,481 --> 01:58:08,915
Today she has come refusing the
marriage arranged by her father.

1058
01:58:09,251 --> 01:58:11,310
Our curses have brought her
to this condition.

1059
01:58:11,486 --> 01:58:14,512
Please listen to me, don't shout,
she may hear you.

1060
01:58:14,689 --> 01:58:16,623
Let her hear,
l'm shouting for that only.

1061
01:58:16,791 --> 01:58:18,224
She has no place in this family.

1062
01:58:18,393 --> 01:58:21,157
lf you want to help her,
keep her away and do it.

1063
01:58:21,329 --> 01:58:22,694
lf you consider her
more than us, leave us.

1064
01:58:22,864 --> 01:58:25,662
lf not we'll go out.
Decide it now.

1065
01:58:32,307 --> 01:58:36,539
They threw me out of the house.
They didn't like me.

1066
01:58:38,813 --> 01:58:40,804
They talked bad about my mother.

1067
01:58:41,183 --> 01:58:44,949
So l couldn't stay there.
That's why l left them.

1068
01:58:47,956 --> 01:58:52,188
Mother told there's a road with
grandpa's name in Bombay.

1069
01:58:52,727 --> 01:58:56,527
But didn't expect l'll be
on the road.

1070
01:58:57,699 --> 01:59:00,361
You spent three hard days
to bring me here,

1071
01:59:00,802 --> 01:59:04,704
l didn't want you to know this.
So tried to manage it.

1072
01:59:06,942 --> 01:59:10,708
But the old man spilled
all the beans.

1073
01:59:42,097 --> 01:59:44,395
You made me to bleed that day.

1074
01:59:44,566 --> 01:59:48,627
You made me eat stinking food
in jail for 6 months.

1075
02:00:33,748 --> 02:00:34,578
Give that to me.

1076
02:00:36,050 --> 02:00:39,349
You don't have anything
to do with him.

1077
02:00:39,521 --> 02:00:40,351
He's my enemy.

1078
02:00:40,522 --> 02:00:46,518
You wanted the girl, take her.
Go...go...

1079
02:00:47,462 --> 02:00:48,793
Bloody!

1080
02:01:00,275 --> 02:01:04,211
Drive the car slowly,
let's watch him getting beaten up.

1081
02:01:41,182 --> 02:01:43,241
Drive fast!

1082
02:05:30,445 --> 02:05:32,970
Anyone still there? Come!

1083
02:05:38,753 --> 02:05:41,654
lf you come after me
or that girl...

1084
02:05:50,331 --> 02:05:52,822
Come, let me see who will
dare come after us.

1085
02:06:05,580 --> 02:06:06,512
Get in.

1086
02:06:13,955 --> 02:06:16,014
Nobody will come now,
don't get scared.

1087
02:06:16,357 --> 02:06:17,517
l'll take care of everything.

1088
02:06:37,745 --> 02:06:39,042
What happened, Shiva?

1089
02:06:39,981 --> 02:06:41,141
Look there!

1090
02:06:54,595 --> 02:06:56,961
You never told us that
you're coming with her.

1091
02:06:57,131 --> 02:06:59,895
Couldn't tolerate his torture.
He tortured us.

1092
02:07:00,067 --> 02:07:03,059
He saw you in a bus in Bangalore,
and since then we are finished.

1093
02:07:03,404 --> 02:07:05,929
ln a Bangalore bus...
Saw me in a Bangalore bus?

1094
02:07:06,107 --> 02:07:09,565
He missed his interview
because of you.

1095
02:07:10,778 --> 02:07:11,574
lnterview?

1096
02:07:11,746 --> 02:07:15,147
Every time anything happened,
he called us to spoil our work.

1097
02:07:15,683 --> 02:07:17,981
He cried a lot after leaving you
in your grandma's home.

1098
02:07:18,152 --> 02:07:20,677

1099
02:07:22,023 --> 02:07:23,888
He loves you so much.

1100
02:07:24,058 --> 02:07:28,825
l told him to express his feelings but
he insisted you must come forth first.

02:07:28,996 --> 02:07:32,591
He would've chanted your name
atleast 1000 times a day.

1102
02:07:49,183 --> 02:07:50,241
That is...

1103
02:07:52,486 --> 02:07:56,889
They are making fun...
Nothing of that sort...

1104
02:07:57,091 --> 02:08:01,255
Why are you playing truant?
