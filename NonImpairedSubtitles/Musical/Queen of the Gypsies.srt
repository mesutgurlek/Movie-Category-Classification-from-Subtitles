1
00:01:48,800 --> 00:01:51,520
You can feel in the air
a moisture like in the grave.

2
00:01:52,800 --> 00:01:54,800
Smells like this from six months.

3
00:01:56,320 --> 00:02:00,760
Ciudra!
Why did you left the family?

4
00:02:03,480 --> 00:02:08,600
Gipsies are not like they used to be...
Now they trade their horses for gold.

5
00:02:13,200 --> 00:02:14,320
And their soul...

6
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:19,200
Who knows more??
The dumb or the wise?

7
00:02:20,800 --> 00:02:25,080
The dumb. The wise
is not suer about anything.

8
00:02:25,200 --> 00:02:26,800
It's better to be dumb.

9
00:02:30,400 --> 00:02:33,560
Too much thinking
brings lots of trouble.

10
00:02:34,080 --> 00:02:36,800
What advice can you give me
if we won't meet again?

11
00:02:37,040 --> 00:02:39,200
Don't love money.
Money dissapoint you.

12
00:02:41,200 --> 00:02:44,200
Don't love women too.
They will trade you.

13
00:02:45,800 --> 00:02:49,960
From all the drinks,
freedom is the sweetest.

14
00:02:51,760 --> 00:02:58,800
Wake up in the morning and don't forget:
life ends when you don't expect.

15
00:03:00,680 --> 00:03:06,000
I wish you a long life.
And die when the right time comes.

16
00:03:08,320 --> 00:03:12,000
THE GIPSY HERD

00:03:12,400 --> 00:03:14,400

Four kings.

22
00:05:31,680 --> 00:05:34,600
Let's drink, gentlemen,
for the new 20th century!

23
00:05:35,320 --> 00:05:36,000
Happy new year!

24
00:05:36,400 --> 00:05:38,200
- Schwob!
- Yes, mr locotnent!

25
00:05:38,400 --> 00:05:41,120
- do you know how to waltz?
- No, mr locotnent.

26
00:05:41,760 --> 00:05:43,760
Put your right hand on my left arm.

27
00:05:43,960 --> 00:05:45,960
Yes sir!

28
00:06:31,200 --> 00:06:33,000
How is going to be the 20th century?

29
00:06:33,200 --> 00:06:38,400
The zodiac signs announce
the end of the world after 16 years.

30
00:07:23,720 --> 00:07:25,800
Look, mr Balint!

31
00:07:28,640 --> 00:07:29,680
Couldn't you
wait until tomorrow?

32
00:07:29,800 --> 00:07:33,200
No. I wanted to try my luck
now, to know how this year will be.

33
00:07:33,440 --> 00:07:36,400
Now I know it will be wonderful!
Look!

34
00:07:38,200 --> 00:07:42,000
You don't find horses like this
on these lands

35
00:07:45,000 --> 00:07:45,600
Make some light!

36
00:07:49,000 --> 00:07:49,800
More!

37
00:07:52,720 --> 00:07:53,440
I don't buy horses
stolen from officers.

38
00:07:53,600 --> 00:07:57,040
- What about the others?
- I said I don't want this kind of horses.

39
00:07:57,600 --> 00:08:04,320
Don't take it! Tomorrow, at the
market, will sell them on gold.

40
00:08:05,400 --> 00:08:08,400
Wait! We have some unfinished
business. What about that?

41
00:08:09,600 --> 00:08:13,200
This is your problem.
You don't let me breathe.

42
00:08:13,400 --> 00:08:18,600
- I want fair trading.
- Fair? With stolen horses?

43
00:08:41,600 --> 00:08:46,400
I want to say to your guests and to
your family a Happy New Year.

44
00:08:46,960 --> 00:08:47,800
Thank you very much.

45
00:08:49,000 --> 00:08:51,200
It's not good to start a
new year with old owes.

46
00:09:08,080 --> 00:09:10,080
Let's go!

47
00:09:10,800 --> 00:09:12,800
Forgive me!

48
00:09:14,760 --> 00:09:16,760
Wait for me here!

49
00:09:32,400 --> 00:09:34,800
- Do you like this?
- Not really.

50
00:09:43,600 --> 00:09:46,400
- I'll give you the rest until Easter.
- Fine.

51
00:09:47,800 --> 00:09:52,400
I left you some good
stallions. Happy New Year!

52
00:12:21,920 --> 00:12:22,600
Get off the horses!

53
00:12:26,600 --> 00:12:29,600
Come on! Come on!

54
00:12:43,640 --> 00:12:45,640
Zobar! Go left!

55
00:13:02,320 --> 00:13:04,280
Surround'em!

56
00:13:04,280 --> 00:13:08,160
Catch them alive!
I want them alive!

57
00:13:09,760 --> 00:13:11,760
Confuse them!

58
00:13:13,080 --> 00:13:15,080
Make them dizzy!

59
00:13:22,280 --> 00:13:26,200
Leave those darn horses!
They will catch us and hang us!

60
00:13:27,640 --> 00:13:30,400
COme on, who is closer!
Take me, come on!

61
00:13:34,720 --> 00:13:36,720
We will hang in ropes.

62
00:13:39,920 --> 00:13:44,800
Leave the horses, Zobar!
Let's cross river Tisa.

63
00:13:49,040 --> 00:13:50,400
Shut up!

64
00:13:50,800 --> 00:13:54,200
Don't kill the horses! You're not
sorry for them either, darn gipsies!

65
00:13:54,360 --> 00:13:58,600
Crows will take away
my blue eyes.

66
00:14:01,120 --> 00:14:05,080
I will hang you!
From your legs!

67
00:14:08,400 --> 00:14:09,600
Confuse them, confuse them!

68
00:14:15,200 --> 00:14:16,400
Let's go!

69
00:14:16,040 --> 00:14:18,400
Dog!

70
00:14:18,600 --> 00:14:19,200
Run!

71
00:14:26,720 --> 00:14:28,720
After them!

72
00:14:29,520 --> 00:14:31,520
Save me, hawk!

73
00:14:42,360 --> 00:14:44,360
Oh! They killed me!

74
00:16:42,720 --> 00:16:44,720
Who are you?

75
00:16:46,360 --> 00:16:51,760
They call me Zobar.

76
00:16:58,640 --> 00:17:00,440
What is that?

77
00:17:00,440 --> 00:17:02,440
Turn around!

78
00:17:04,600 --> 00:17:05,400
Grass of the moon.

79
00:17:05,760 --> 00:17:09,320
I drank water from the grass moon
for the bullett not to touch me.

80
00:17:10,200 --> 00:17:11,000
I can see that!

81
00:17:34,800 --> 00:17:38,400
Leave your left hand down,
so that evil go to the ground!

82
00:17:40,920 --> 00:17:44,800
- Where do you come from?
- From Galitia.

83
00:17:44,440 --> 00:17:49,720
It's snow on Carpatian Mountains,
but here, on Tisa, it's summer.

84
00:18:00,000 --> 00:18:01,400
You will get better.

85
00:18:14,120 --> 00:18:16,120
Where are you?

86
00:18:18,880 --> 00:18:20,880
Where are you?

87
00:18:41,000 --> 00:18:43,000
Zobar!

88
00:18:46,000 --> 00:18:50,200
Wondering the world...
You forgot us!

89
00:18:56,680 --> 00:18:58,680
Welcome, Zobar!

90
00:19:04,760 --> 00:19:09,200
Rusalina, wake up!
Zobar came, with gifts.

91
00:19:16,720 --> 00:19:18,720
Luicu!

92
00:19:32,520 --> 00:19:37,600
- Am I beautiful now?
- More beautiful than the moment of death.

93
00:19:49,520 --> 00:19:52,400
Was our mother beautiful?

94
00:19:53,600 --> 00:19:57,600
So beautiful that other women
from the village were banishing her.

95
00:19:58,600 --> 00:20:01,600
That's what they were doing
when they were seeing her.

96
00:20:03,000 --> 00:20:05,400
Yes, she was the most beautiful
from the gipsy race.

97
00:20:06,120 --> 00:20:08,920
- So I am beautiful too.
- Why do you say this?

98
00:20:09,600 --> 00:20:12,600
People say I look just like my mother.

99
00:20:14,280 --> 00:20:18,000
I will look for an artist
to make your mother's face.

100
00:20:18,440 --> 00:20:20,440
A small one...

101
00:20:22,080 --> 00:20:24,080
Hello father!

102
00:20:29,080 --> 00:20:32,000
People are saying you studied a lot.

103
00:20:33,520 --> 00:20:38,240
You know how to read in
russian, german, polish and romanian.

104
00:20:38,280 --> 00:20:42,800
-You know many things...
- That's right, father. Sto je istina, istina je.

105
00:20:44,240 --> 00:20:50,800
I read people's faces.
Do you think this is easyer?

106
00:20:52,040 --> 00:20:57,400
No father, Your knowledge
is more useful.

107
00:20:59,080 --> 00:21:02,200
I can see the shadow of death on your face.

108
00:21:02,920 --> 00:21:08,400
- Put it away!
- If i could...

109
00:21:10,320 --> 00:21:13,280
- How many horses did they killed on you?
- Three.

110
00:21:13,760 --> 00:21:17,400
I gave up after the second.
You should give up!

111
00:21:17,640 --> 00:21:19,640
I can't, father!

112
00:21:52,280 --> 00:21:57,600
- How come you don't miss a single drop?
- I pour the wine using my ear.

113
00:21:58,000 --> 00:22:00,800
I recognise your horse after its gallop.

114
00:22:10,160 --> 00:22:14,160
- In your honor!
- Yours too!

115
00:22:35,400 --> 00:22:38,800
Please take!
I give you from my heart.

116
00:22:40,440 --> 00:22:42,440
I bow before you!

117
00:22:45,120 --> 00:22:47,120
You throw with money...

118
00:22:50,800 --> 00:22:53,200
Haralambie!
Put your face against the wall!

119
00:22:57,800 --> 00:23:02,080
SIng a love song
for Iliusca to fall asleep!

120
00:23:02,360 --> 00:23:06,400
- You don't have shame!
- Yes, Iliusca!

121
00:23:06,720 --> 00:23:10,320
Lust doesn't know about shame.

122
00:23:45,800 --> 00:23:52,400
I am like grass for you.
You come, you cut it and you leave.

123
00:23:54,840 --> 00:23:59,000
- What's wrong? You're burning. Are you sick?
- No.

124
00:23:59,280 --> 00:24:01,280
I will bring some cold water.

125
00:26:15,320 --> 00:26:16,760
Swiss watches.

126
00:26:16,760 --> 00:26:20,320
Take, mr gipsy!
See how nice it sounds!

127
00:26:34,680 --> 00:26:36,680
It takes your eyes away.

128
00:26:36,720 --> 00:26:39,840
Swiss watches!
For you, lady!

129
00:26:40,800 --> 00:26:44,400
Or for the mister...
Swiss watches!

130
00:27:12,360 --> 00:27:15,600
- Do me too!
- Me too!

131
00:27:17,080 --> 00:27:20,600
How wonderful!

132
00:27:23,360 --> 00:27:26,000
I am good at many things,
but not at this.

133
00:27:52,160 --> 00:27:55,800
- When will you give back what you owe me?
- Don't worry. That time will come!.

134
00:28:10,120 --> 00:28:14,800
Hey, beautiful, i can guess for you!
Tell you everything...

135
00:28:15,000 --> 00:28:18,000
- Good horse!
- Arabian stallion.

136
00:28:18,800 --> 00:28:19,600
I see...

137
00:28:22,000 --> 00:28:25,600
Last year I bought
a hores from you.

138
00:28:26,000 --> 00:28:26,800
From me?

139
00:28:30,360 --> 00:28:34,280
You painted it with ink,
bastard!

140
00:28:39,160 --> 00:28:41,600
I was looking since last year after you!

141
00:28:44,000 --> 00:28:46,000
Come here!

142
00:28:52,600 --> 00:28:53,800
Come!

143
00:29:06,000 --> 00:29:08,000
I will kill you!

144
00:29:14,120 --> 00:29:17,600
Don't kill each other!
We are already a few.

145
00:29:20,400 --> 00:29:22,400
Relax!

146
00:29:22,800 --> 00:29:24,400
Take off your coat!

147
00:29:23,120 --> 00:29:25,800
I can't.
I will feel cold.

148
00:29:26,600 --> 00:29:31,320
Take this bandit away from us! spasite nas!

149
00:29:31,480 --> 00:29:33,400
We will show him.

150
00:29:33,560 --> 00:29:36,800
Please!
Don't touch him!

151
00:29:41,280 --> 00:29:43,280
My dear!

152
00:29:43,440 --> 00:29:47,200
I would like to kick his ass!
Am I right?

153
00:29:47,400 --> 00:29:49,240
Yes, dear!

154
00:29:51,600 --> 00:29:55,000
I don't care about money.
Let him go!

155
00:29:55,000 --> 00:29:57,400
I know my job...
We'll be OK.

156
00:29:57,600 --> 00:29:59,400
He's not better too.
He should be whipped.

157
00:30:01,400 --> 00:30:07,600
- They're all dust in the wind.
- Who wants to whip me? You?

158
00:30:12,080 --> 00:30:17,800
If we don't steal nothing,
how could a gipsy live?

159
00:30:18,240 --> 00:30:22,000
I don't want to catch
you around! Get lost!

160
00:30:23,000 --> 00:30:25,000
I won't forget this all my live.
Thank you very much!

161
00:30:25,120 --> 00:30:28,520
- Where did you come from?
- I am from Galitia.

162
00:30:31,960 --> 00:30:33,400
Why have you done this?

163
00:30:34,000 --> 00:30:37,600
- Stop stealing chickens!
- Steal what?

164
00:30:38,040 --> 00:30:41,200
Virgins and horses.
Learn how to work!

165
00:30:42,640 --> 00:30:45,480
Do I have a face for that?

166
00:30:45,800 --> 00:30:48,160
- What's your name?
- Bucea.

167
00:30:48,600 --> 00:30:50,800
- And the name of your boss?
- Nur.

168
00:30:51,040 --> 00:30:53,840
- Is still Nur?
- I wish he was dead!

169
00:30:54,920 --> 00:30:56,920
And who are you?

170
00:30:57,080 --> 00:31:00,000
I am Zobar.
Never heard of me?

171
00:31:02,000 --> 00:31:04,000
Luicu Zobar?

172
00:31:06,520 --> 00:31:11,280
I wish you live a thousand years,
you fearless hawk!

173
00:31:11,440 --> 00:31:17,600
Zobar? In flesh and bones?
REally, I can't believe this!

174
00:31:18,760 --> 00:31:23,600
Come to us! The family
camped on the shore of Tisa.

175
00:31:25,200 --> 00:31:30,800
You will like our gipsies.
I am the only crazy one.

176
00:31:33,200 --> 00:31:34,000
From my soul!

177
00:31:36,000 --> 00:31:36,800
From my heart!

178
00:31:40,120 --> 00:31:43,480
You should see our girls!
Living icons!

179
00:33:09,120 --> 00:33:11,120
Get away from the road!

180
00:33:11,960 --> 00:33:13,960
Darn you!

181
00:33:19,680 --> 00:33:21,680
Come back!

182
00:33:51,680 --> 00:33:53,680
So that's what you do!

183
00:33:55,480 --> 00:33:57,480
Howdy, young ladies!

184
00:33:58,920 --> 00:34:04,000
You may be smart,
but your driver is a moron.

185
00:34:04,400 --> 00:34:06,400
Forgive us both!

186
00:34:06,880 --> 00:34:09,800
Look at my hand...
Can you guess for me?

187
00:34:10,160 --> 00:34:14,800
- I can guess your name.
- Say it!

188
00:34:18,040 --> 00:34:22,400
Mister! I can see it all...
Antal is your name.

189
00:34:24,920 --> 00:34:28,000
You will have a long life,
but don't get mad because I tell you this...

190
00:34:28,200 --> 00:34:30,000
Your life will be sad...

191
00:34:30,800 --> 00:34:34,800
You are a weak man,
baked from soft mixture.

192
00:34:36,000 --> 00:34:38,000
Anything good to tell me?

193
00:34:41,280 --> 00:34:43,280
Let me drive the horses!

194
00:34:48,120 --> 00:34:53,000
- Mister, I told you! You're soft!
- Apolodor! Give her the whip!

195
00:34:56,160 --> 00:34:58,160
Go to the tavern!

196
00:34:58,520 --> 00:35:02,400
- There you go, young ladies!
- Come up, girls!

197
00:36:04,720 --> 00:36:06,720
Come to my land!

198
00:36:08,200 --> 00:36:10,200
- To be your servant?
- No, no way!

199
00:36:11,000 --> 00:36:13,000
Fly like the wind!

200
00:36:43,600 --> 00:36:48,800
Your heiness! We received
new models from Paris.

201
00:36:49,400 --> 00:36:53,320
Latest fashion hit.
Come! Come and see!

202
00:36:57,360 --> 00:36:59,360
Come, your heiness!

203
00:38:34,200 --> 00:38:36,000
Look what a guest
has arrived!

204
00:38:36,200 --> 00:38:38,200
A fine one!

205
00:39:09,320 --> 00:39:12,800
When we see you
it's celebation for us.

206
00:39:17,920 --> 00:39:21,000
Our family is stronger now.
Ciudra is back.

207
00:39:21,400 --> 00:39:27,600
Danilo returned back!
A soldier who fought many battles

208
00:39:28,480 --> 00:39:31,200
He also brought his daughter, Radu.

209
00:39:32,000 --> 00:39:36,000
The sky enlightened
above our family.

210
00:39:38,920 --> 00:39:45,800
Does your heart tells you
to leave or to stay?

211
00:41:36,960 --> 00:41:39,800
Let it go!
This will destroy you!

212
00:41:40,200 --> 00:41:42,600
Nobody will be able to save you.
Not even me!

213
00:41:43,520 --> 00:41:47,400
Stay away from her!
She's a whitch.

214
00:43:01,160 --> 00:43:03,600
- Do you remember me?
- No.

215
00:43:04,400 --> 00:43:08,600
- It was you! You had four pony-tails.
- No!

216
00:43:08,800 --> 00:43:10,320
You healed me with the grass of the moon.

217
00:43:30,800 --> 00:43:31,800
It's her!

218
00:43:39,280 --> 00:43:41,280
Let go! Come on!

219
00:44:08,760 --> 00:44:10,760
I am made from stone.

220
00:44:13,520 --> 00:44:16,000
- Good!
- What is good?

221
00:44:15,680 --> 00:44:18,400
You speak beautiful,
but you lie ugly.

222
00:44:27,760 --> 00:44:29,760
What an ugly horse!

223
00:44:29,840 --> 00:44:34,400
I will get you a white mare,
crazy like you.

224
00:44:38,280 --> 00:44:42,800
You will die because of me!

225
00:44:56,040 --> 00:44:59,640
I take the mare. You take the rest.

226
00:45:00,040 --> 00:45:04,400
Took away your thinking,
you deviless.

227
00:45:07,600 --> 00:45:09,200
Those women!

228
00:46:18,640 --> 00:46:19,760
Where is Zobar?

229
00:46:22,800 --> 00:46:24,800
We will get them
and we will hang him!

230
00:46:25,600 --> 00:46:29,880
Tomorrow! But today,
you can work for money!

231
00:46:32,480 --> 00:46:36,000
100 gold coins
for whom catches Zobar alive.

232
00:46:39,160 --> 00:46:43,600
Don't lay your hands on
the great emperor Franz Iosef!

233
00:46:45,200 --> 00:46:46,400
Don't touch him!

234
00:46:46,600 --> 00:46:49,600
WHere's Luicu Zobar?
Where's Zobar?

235
00:46:50,880 --> 00:46:53,600
Who knows where he is?

236
00:46:54,440 --> 00:46:57,600
We will kill your bears and horses!

237
00:46:58,800 --> 00:47:01,440
Did you hear that, gipsies?
Where is he?

238
00:47:02,400 --> 00:47:04,400
Give him to us, and get
100 gold coins for him.

239
00:47:05,120 --> 00:47:09,200
- Let go of the wheel!
- I will teach you!
