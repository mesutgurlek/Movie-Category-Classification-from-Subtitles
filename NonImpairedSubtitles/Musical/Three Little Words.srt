1
00:01:48,024 --> 00:01:51,585
<i>Where did you get that girl?</i>
<i>Oh, you lucky devil</i>

2
00:01:51,761 --> 00:01:55,288
<i>Where did you get that girl?</i>
<i>Tell me on the level</i>

3
00:01:55,465 --> 00:01:59,026
<i>Have you ever kissed her?</i>
<i>If she has a sister</i>

4
00:01:59,202 --> 00:02:02,968
<i>Lead me, lead me</i>
<i>Lead me to her mister</i>

5
00:02:03,139 --> 00:02:06,472
<i>Gee, I wish that I had a girl</i>

6
00:02:06,643 --> 00:02:10,477
<i>I'd love her, I'd love her</i>
<i>Oh, goodness, how I'd love her</i>

7
00:02:10,647 --> 00:02:14,242
<i>If you can find another</i>
<i>I'll take her home to Mother</i>

8
00:02:14,417 --> 00:02:18,877
<i>Where? Where?</i>
<i>Where did you get that girl?</i>

9
00:03:51,314 --> 00:03:54,283
Five bows and an encore.
Not bad for a Tuesday night, huh?

10
00:03:54,450 --> 00:03:56,384
They loved you, Jess.

11
00:03:56,552 --> 00:03:58,713
Come on, I'll buy you a steak.

12
00:03:58,888 --> 00:04:01,049
Hey, wait. I wanna watch
Mendoza's opening trick.

13
00:04:01,224 --> 00:04:02,953
- What, again?
- Hi, Jess.

14
00:04:03,126 --> 00:04:05,890
Bert, big news.
I just closed the deal for you.

15
00:04:06,062 --> 00:04:08,189
Eighty weeks solid
on the Orpheum time.

16
00:04:08,364 --> 00:04:10,559
Two seasons straight.
How do you like that?

17
00:04:10,733 --> 00:04:12,098
Watch this. It's terrific.

18
00:04:24,380 --> 00:04:26,678
Here's your new song.
Hot off the presses.

19
00:04:26,849 --> 00:04:29,784
"'Where Did You Get That Girl? '
Words by Bert Kalmar...

20
00:04:29,953 --> 00:04:32,615
...co-author of 'Hello, Hawaii,'
'Oh! What a Pal Was Mary."'

21
00:04:32,789 --> 00:04:34,552
- Am I an agent?
- Yeah, yeah. Now, look.

22
00:04:34,757 --> 00:04:38,523
- Hey, what's going on?
- Magic is going on.

23
00:04:48,304 --> 00:04:49,737
Come in.

24
00:04:50,473 --> 00:04:53,408
- Oh, I thought you'd be dressed by now.
- Jess, listen. Come here.

25
00:04:53,576 --> 00:04:56,374
I've got a great idea,
an opening for the new act.

26
00:04:56,546 --> 00:04:58,980
I come out in one, see?
I'm a magician.

27
00:04:59,148 --> 00:05:00,376
- Oh, a magician.
- Yeah.

28
00:05:00,550 --> 00:05:02,609
I'm in a full dress suit,
medals on my chest...

29
00:05:02,785 --> 00:05:05,720
...maybe a mustache
and a little goatee.

30
00:05:05,888 --> 00:05:07,515
Yes, I adore little goatees.

31
00:05:07,690 --> 00:05:09,658
And you come on as my assistant.

32
00:05:09,826 --> 00:05:11,919
I hand you my gloves...

33
00:05:12,795 --> 00:05:14,285
Hey, wait a minute.

34
00:05:14,464 --> 00:05:17,365
- You're not walking out on me, are you?
- Not yet.

35
00:05:17,533 --> 00:05:21,230
- What you open the door for?
- Because I'm a nice girl, Mr. Kalmar.

36
00:05:21,404 --> 00:05:23,998
And a nice girl
always leaves the door open.

37
00:05:24,173 --> 00:05:27,404
You know, we could fix all that
so you won't have to worry about doors.

38
00:05:27,577 --> 00:05:29,067
We could get married.

39
00:05:29,579 --> 00:05:31,513
I'd like that.

40
00:05:31,681 --> 00:05:33,706
Maybe someday
when you're not so rushed, Bert.

41
00:05:33,883 --> 00:05:36,477
So you don't have to propose
in short pants.

42
00:05:38,454 --> 00:05:40,183
Listen, Jess, I'm not kidding.

43
00:05:41,257 --> 00:05:43,122
Neither am I.

44
00:05:43,359 --> 00:05:44,656
You're too busy, Bert.

45
00:05:44,827 --> 00:05:47,660
A big headliner, important songwriter.

46
00:05:48,231 --> 00:05:50,199
A magician.

47
00:05:50,533 --> 00:05:52,125
Now you're writing a play.

48
00:05:52,301 --> 00:05:54,826
You want to be everything
in show business all at once.

49
00:05:55,304 --> 00:05:57,795
And I just want to be a wife.

50
00:05:59,175 --> 00:06:01,837
You couldn't light in one spot
long enough for the ceremony.

51
00:06:03,179 --> 00:06:04,771
Okay, Jess.

52
00:06:04,947 --> 00:06:08,974
But if you ever do decide to marry me,
you'll speak right up, won't you?

53
00:06:09,552 --> 00:06:11,452
You'll be the first to know.

54
00:06:11,954 --> 00:06:13,512
Thanks, Jess.

55
00:06:13,689 --> 00:06:16,453
Well, what about that magic idea?

56
00:06:18,361 --> 00:06:19,589
Well, what's the matter?

57
00:06:19,762 --> 00:06:23,459
- Just a couple of tricks for an opening?
- And for a finish, you saw me in half.

58
00:06:23,633 --> 00:06:25,692
Next thing you know,
you'll be doing a single.

59
00:06:25,868 --> 00:06:27,961
"Kalmar The Magnificent."

60
00:06:30,373 --> 00:06:32,432
Maybe you think I couldn't.

61
00:06:32,775 --> 00:06:35,972
- Maybe I'll surprise you.
- Nothing you did would surprise me.

62
00:06:36,145 --> 00:06:39,114
You know, sometimes I think
you'd rather be a bad magician...

63
00:06:39,282 --> 00:06:40,544
...than a good actor.

64
00:06:43,319 --> 00:06:45,753
- How do I look?
- Beautiful.

65
00:06:45,922 --> 00:06:47,787
- Do I need a flower?
- What for?

66
00:06:47,957 --> 00:06:50,050
I think I need a flower.

67
00:06:51,427 --> 00:06:54,919
- Pretty fancy, huh?
- Just wonderful.

68
00:06:55,098 --> 00:06:57,498
- Telephone, Mr. Kalmar.
- Okay.

69
00:06:57,667 --> 00:06:59,066
Be right back.

70
00:07:20,990 --> 00:07:23,925
Clanahan's Paradise,
the best beer on the island.

71
00:07:24,093 --> 00:07:27,221
See Kendall The Great,
miracles and marvels of magic.

72
00:07:27,396 --> 00:07:31,389
And appearing on the stage right now,
The Four Little Boys in Gray.

73
00:07:31,567 --> 00:07:34,195
Fifteen acts of...

74
00:07:34,804 --> 00:07:38,035
<i>Jimmy O'Leary said I've got a theory</i>

75
00:07:38,207 --> 00:07:41,734
<i>She's different from all of your girls</i>

76
00:07:41,911 --> 00:07:44,971
<i>She's not a queen</i>
<i>Like you see on the screen</i>

77
00:07:45,148 --> 00:07:48,413
<i>And she ain't got</i>
<i>No diamonds or pearls</i>

78
00:07:48,584 --> 00:07:53,385
<i>But she's mine, all mine</i>

79
00:07:53,556 --> 00:07:56,116
Giants 4, Philadelphia 2.
End of the seventh.

80
00:07:56,292 --> 00:07:59,693
<i>I told her I worked in a glue factory</i>

81
00:07:59,862 --> 00:08:03,298
<i>And that's how she happened</i>
<i>To get stuck on me</i>

82
00:08:03,466 --> 00:08:05,058
- I'll take over.
- Thanks.

83
00:08:05,234 --> 00:08:06,861
<i>And she's mine, all mine</i>

84
00:08:12,141 --> 00:08:13,972
- Hey, Ruby.
- Yes, sir?

85
00:08:14,143 --> 00:08:16,168
- Where you going?
- This is my supper hour.

86
00:08:16,345 --> 00:08:17,812
I thought I'd go out for a catch.

87
00:08:17,980 --> 00:08:20,505
Yeah? Well, take it on the hop
to dressing room four.

88
00:08:20,683 --> 00:08:22,981
Kendall The Great needs an assistant.

89
00:08:24,053 --> 00:08:26,180
Say, Mr. Clanahan, would you mind...

90
00:08:26,355 --> 00:08:28,915
...if I asked one of the acts
to sing a song that I wrote?

91
00:08:29,091 --> 00:08:31,821
It's called "On the Shores of Araby."
It goes like this:

92
00:08:31,994 --> 00:08:35,987
<i>I can't forget the night we met</i>
<i>On the shores of Araby</i>

93
00:08:36,165 --> 00:08:40,226
<i>The moon lit up the sky</i>
<i>And love lit up your eyes</i>

94
00:08:40,403 --> 00:08:42,803
<i>I kissed you once</i>
<i>I kissed you twice</i>

95
00:08:42,972 --> 00:08:44,667
<i>As I held you gently</i>

96
00:08:44,840 --> 00:08:49,004
<i>That night upon the shores of Araby</i>

97
00:08:49,178 --> 00:08:51,271
- <i>I never</i>...
- You wrote that?

98
00:08:51,447 --> 00:08:53,381
Yes, sir. Words and music both.

99
00:08:53,549 --> 00:08:55,608
Well, take it on the hop
to dressing room four.

100
00:08:55,785 --> 00:08:57,946
Kendall The Great needs an assistant.

101
00:08:58,120 --> 00:08:59,610
Yes, sir.

102
00:09:05,061 --> 00:09:06,585
Come in.

103
00:09:07,163 --> 00:09:08,892
Mr. Kendall?

104
00:09:10,833 --> 00:09:12,562
Ebbetts Field is that way.

105
00:09:12,735 --> 00:09:15,966
No, I'm your assistant.
Mr. Clanahan said.

106
00:09:16,138 --> 00:09:19,574
Okay. Take those boxes backstage
and pile them up behind the drapes.

107
00:09:19,742 --> 00:09:20,970
Yes, sir.

108
00:09:21,143 --> 00:09:23,611
Now, when I'm on,
I'll give you signal like this:

109
00:09:23,779 --> 00:09:25,770
Whenever you hear that
you take the top box...

110
00:09:25,948 --> 00:09:29,941
...shove an animal through the hole in the
drapes and into the back of the table. Got it?

111
00:09:30,119 --> 00:09:31,313
Animals, huh?

112
00:09:31,487 --> 00:09:33,648
- I want them in just that order.
- Yeah.

113
00:09:33,823 --> 00:09:35,950
Don't fool around with that goose.
He's vicious.

114
00:09:36,125 --> 00:09:37,956
Well, they usually are.

115
00:09:38,728 --> 00:09:40,662
Ladies and gentlemen,
since time began...

116
00:09:40,830 --> 00:09:43,196
...man has placed his trust
in the witch doctor...

117
00:09:43,366 --> 00:09:45,357
...the sorcerer and the voodoo.

118
00:09:45,534 --> 00:09:47,468
Who dares to call them frauds?

119
00:09:47,637 --> 00:09:50,299
Watch carefully, please.

120
00:09:50,473 --> 00:09:53,408
Is this trickery or magic?

121
00:09:56,212 --> 00:09:58,680
Now, I have here
a gentleman's ordinary silk hat.

122
00:09:58,848 --> 00:10:00,076
As you can plainly see...

123
00:10:00,249 --> 00:10:04,413
...there are no secret pockets
and no hidden springs.

124
00:10:04,954 --> 00:10:07,354
I place the hat on the table.

125
00:10:09,191 --> 00:10:11,785
Go on, get in there.
Go on, what are you waiting for?

126
00:10:18,434 --> 00:10:21,301
And now, ladies and gentlemen,
the identical hat.

127
00:10:21,470 --> 00:10:23,631
I'll fill it from this pitcher of water.

128
00:10:23,806 --> 00:10:25,467
Like this.

129
00:10:33,916 --> 00:10:35,781
Is this trickery or magic?

130
00:10:38,254 --> 00:10:41,246
- Oh, look, a goose.
- Now, but don't go near him. He's vicious.

131
00:10:41,424 --> 00:10:42,652
Look.

132
00:10:52,802 --> 00:10:55,737
I would like your attention, please.

133
00:11:03,012 --> 00:11:04,377
Watch carefully.

134
00:11:08,918 --> 00:11:11,250
Now think of a card.
Any card in the deck.

135
00:11:11,420 --> 00:11:14,253
A scientific exhibition
of mind over matter.

136
00:11:29,405 --> 00:11:32,841
For my next deception,
I have here a little handkerchief...

137
00:11:39,415 --> 00:11:41,645
What's going on...?

138
00:11:42,118 --> 00:11:44,712
I'll be right back, Mr. Clanahan.

139
00:11:52,995 --> 00:11:56,954
- You see a goose go by here?
- I saw a lot of them down there.

140
00:12:02,538 --> 00:12:04,768
Watch carefully, please.

141
00:12:14,483 --> 00:12:17,384
Ordinary hat. Ordinary drinking water.

142
00:12:17,553 --> 00:12:19,919
I pour it in the hat like this:

143
00:12:20,990 --> 00:12:23,857
Place it on my head like that.

144
00:12:34,370 --> 00:12:36,429
- Where is he? Where is he?
- Just a minute, you.

145
00:12:36,605 --> 00:12:39,039
That baseball player,
if I ever lay my hands on him...

146
00:12:39,208 --> 00:12:41,699
Get out of my theater
and don't ever come back.

147
00:12:41,877 --> 00:12:43,674
I ought to sue you
for that performance.

148
00:12:43,846 --> 00:12:46,815
I ought to take you to court,
you small-time swami.

149
00:12:46,982 --> 00:12:48,950
Oh, shut up.

150
00:12:50,619 --> 00:12:52,814
- Hello.
- What are you doing here?

151
00:12:52,988 --> 00:12:56,480
Charlie traced you for me.
Nice comedy routine, Bert.

152
00:12:56,659 --> 00:12:59,753
That maniac in a baseball hat.
I was going great until then.

153
00:12:59,929 --> 00:13:02,454
- I had them right there, I was killing them.
- Listen to him.

154
00:13:02,631 --> 00:13:05,429
Every theater in the country
is waiting for Kalmar and Brown...

155
00:13:05,601 --> 00:13:08,968
...but Kendall The Great is killing them
in Coney Island at 5 bucks a night.

156
00:13:09,138 --> 00:13:12,301
What were you trying to prove?
That we ought to use magic in the act?

157
00:13:12,608 --> 00:13:14,906
Not necessarily.
You know what magic is to me.

158
00:13:15,077 --> 00:13:18,945
- It's a hobby. It relaxes me.
- You look relaxed.

159
00:13:19,114 --> 00:13:20,706
Come in.

160
00:13:21,984 --> 00:13:25,476
- Say, a couple of them got away.
- Get out of here!

161
00:13:29,291 --> 00:13:31,282
Bert Kalmar.

162
00:13:31,460 --> 00:13:34,361
That's Bert Kalmar, the songwriter.

163
00:13:35,698 --> 00:13:37,393
Say, Mr. Clanahan, that's Bert Kalmar.

164
00:13:37,566 --> 00:13:40,262
- I saw him at the Palace.
- Yeah. I heard you tell the rabbit.

165
00:13:40,436 --> 00:13:42,131
I recognized him without his mustache.

166
00:13:42,304 --> 00:13:45,171
Sure, sure. Here, son.

167
00:13:45,341 --> 00:13:47,809
And don't look
for another job right away.

168
00:13:47,977 --> 00:13:51,208
Just take a nice, long rest.

169
00:14:13,469 --> 00:14:14,697
Thank you. Thank you.

170
00:14:14,870 --> 00:14:17,896
Now, with your kind indulgence
we'd like to show you what happens...

171
00:14:18,073 --> 00:14:19,540
...when two dancers get married.

172
00:14:19,708 --> 00:14:22,506
Mr. and Mrs. Hoofer at home.
Thank you.

173
00:18:47,743 --> 00:18:50,075
They loved you, Jess.
See them applaud?

174
00:18:50,245 --> 00:18:53,009
- Bert, I was so nervous.
- So was I. You know...

175
00:18:53,182 --> 00:18:56,310
- Sorry, Mr. Kalmar.
- My fault.

176
00:18:56,485 --> 00:18:57,782
Flowers for you.

177
00:18:57,953 --> 00:19:00,012
Oh, they're beautiful.
Who are they from?

178
00:19:00,189 --> 00:19:02,453
The president and I. We chipped in.

179
00:19:02,624 --> 00:19:05,457
- Bert, what is it?
- I don't know.

180
00:19:07,262 --> 00:19:10,231
"Kalmar and Brown, who opened
their new act to bravos last month...

181
00:19:10,399 --> 00:19:13,232
...have been cancelled
following an accident backstage.

182
00:19:13,402 --> 00:19:15,597
Doctors say Kalmar
will not be able to dance...

183
00:19:15,771 --> 00:19:18,968
...for at least a year, possibly two."

184
00:19:19,975 --> 00:19:22,375
I couldn't think of a tougher break.

185
00:19:22,578 --> 00:19:24,136
It's Jessie I'm thinking about.

186
00:19:24,313 --> 00:19:26,042
She can't just sit around waiting.

187
00:19:26,215 --> 00:19:28,706
When you lay off too long,
they think you're through.

188
00:19:28,884 --> 00:19:30,852
And I'm not gonna let that
happen to her.

189
00:19:31,019 --> 00:19:34,352
Now, why can't she just pick up another
partner and take out the same act?

190
00:19:34,523 --> 00:19:37,219
Bert, I told you,
the act needs your name.

191
00:19:37,593 --> 00:19:40,061
She wouldn't make the expenses.

192
00:19:41,196 --> 00:19:45,860
- You sunk a lot of dough into it, huh?
- Not much. Just everything I own.

193
00:19:49,171 --> 00:19:50,934
- Hello.
- Hi, Jess.

194
00:19:51,106 --> 00:19:52,869
- Hello.
- I've ordered breakfast.

195
00:19:53,041 --> 00:19:54,269
- How are you, Charlie?
- Good.

196
00:19:54,443 --> 00:19:56,035
- Hey, doughnuts?
- Sure.

197
00:19:56,211 --> 00:19:58,338
Why did you have to go shopping?
No room service?

198
00:19:58,513 --> 00:20:00,208
I figured we'd save the tip.

199
00:20:00,382 --> 00:20:03,146
That wolf at the door
might get pretty hungry.

200
00:20:03,318 --> 00:20:05,946
I've got to catch a rehearsal
down at Loew's.

201
00:20:06,121 --> 00:20:08,112
- I'll see you, Jess. Bert.
- Bye, Charlie.

202
00:20:08,290 --> 00:20:11,282
See you later.
Come here, honey.

203
00:20:14,196 --> 00:20:17,927
Now, listen. That crack about
the wolf at the door, that's out, see?

204
00:20:18,100 --> 00:20:20,261
- You won't be around to meet him.
- No?

205
00:20:20,435 --> 00:20:21,925
I've been talking to Charlie.

206
00:20:22,104 --> 00:20:25,198
We figured you ought to go out as a single.
I can write a new routine.

207
00:20:25,374 --> 00:20:27,569
Charlie guarantees the booking,
says it's a cinch.

208
00:20:27,743 --> 00:20:29,768
You boys have been
wasting your time.

209
00:20:29,945 --> 00:20:32,243
My plans are all set.

210
00:20:32,414 --> 00:20:35,042
I always told you
if ever I changed my mind...

211
00:20:35,217 --> 00:20:37,583
...you'd be the first to know.

212
00:20:38,687 --> 00:20:43,522
Of course, it took a broken kneecap
to make you stop bouncing long enough.

213
00:20:43,692 --> 00:20:47,059
But I'm satisfied.

214
00:20:49,131 --> 00:20:52,157
Say, maybe you didn't hear me.

215
00:20:52,334 --> 00:20:54,666
I just accepted your proposal.

216
00:20:54,836 --> 00:20:56,736
Look, Jess...

217
00:20:57,239 --> 00:20:59,434
I won't be bouncing
for a long time yet.

218
00:20:59,608 --> 00:21:03,374
And a fellow with a wife to support
has to get around pretty fast, you know.

219
00:21:03,545 --> 00:21:06,412
Well, I'm not a girl
that needs a new sable every winter.

220
00:21:06,581 --> 00:21:10,608
What about your writing, Bert?
Your play, your songs?

221
00:21:10,786 --> 00:21:13,619
You don't have to click your heels
in the air to write a lyric.

222
00:21:13,789 --> 00:21:15,017
Now, wait a minute.

223
00:21:15,190 --> 00:21:17,750
I'd like to write a great play, sure.
Who wouldn't?

224
00:21:17,926 --> 00:21:20,986
And those songs,
they're just a sideline for fun.

225
00:21:21,163 --> 00:21:23,961
I never tried to make a living at it.
I'm not even sure I can.

226
00:21:25,133 --> 00:21:26,361
Until I find out, l...

227
00:21:26,535 --> 00:21:29,299
You don't want me
hanging around your neck.

228
00:21:29,471 --> 00:21:30,836
Is that it?

229
00:21:31,006 --> 00:21:33,338
I didn't say that.

230
00:21:38,513 --> 00:21:40,811
Now, don't be sore at me, huh?

231
00:21:41,383 --> 00:21:44,352
I'm not sore.

232
00:21:44,519 --> 00:21:50,719
But it isn't every day
that a girl gets turned down.

233
00:21:52,794 --> 00:21:55,456
Jessie, listen. Listen. Jessie!

234
00:21:55,630 --> 00:21:57,257
Jessie!

235
00:22:18,552 --> 00:22:20,486
Wish you could write
another song like that.

236
00:22:20,654 --> 00:22:23,020
- I could sure use it.
- I'll tell you a secret, Al.

237
00:22:23,190 --> 00:22:25,420
- So could I.
- Well, what's the matter?

238
00:22:25,592 --> 00:22:27,719
Oh, I don't know.
I just haven't hit on anything.

239
00:22:27,895 --> 00:22:30,227
- I can't seem to get started.
- Oh, you will.

240
00:22:30,397 --> 00:22:32,422
What do you hear from Jessie?

241
00:22:32,599 --> 00:22:35,693
Oh, she framed a new act. Doing fine.

242
00:22:36,970 --> 00:22:38,961
Say, what is that?
One of your new ones?

243
00:22:39,139 --> 00:22:40,766
That?

244
00:22:40,941 --> 00:22:43,375
Some Arabian song
one of our pluggers wrote.

245
00:22:43,544 --> 00:22:46,240
Plays it all day long,
drives me nuts.

246
00:22:46,413 --> 00:22:47,778
Get me Harry Ruby.

247
00:22:47,948 --> 00:22:49,540
I think I'll throw him out of here.

248
00:22:49,716 --> 00:22:51,877
Arabian song, huh?

249
00:22:52,319 --> 00:22:54,150
Not a bad tune.

250
00:22:54,922 --> 00:22:56,685
Yeah, it is kind of catchy.

251
00:22:56,857 --> 00:23:00,156
Hello, Ruby, come in here, son.

252
00:23:00,727 --> 00:23:01,955
Let you talk to him.

253
00:23:02,129 --> 00:23:05,326
You know, an Araby song
might be just the thing right now.

254
00:23:05,833 --> 00:23:07,698
- Yes, chief?
- Oh, come in, Ruby.

255
00:23:07,868 --> 00:23:09,859
Bert, this is Harry Ruby.

256
00:23:10,037 --> 00:23:11,504
- Bert Kalmar.
- Hi.

257
00:23:11,672 --> 00:23:14,766
Ruby, Mr. Kalmar wants to hear
that Arabian song of yours.

258
00:23:14,942 --> 00:23:17,274
Yes. You bet. Yes, sir.

259
00:23:19,680 --> 00:23:22,114
It's called
"On the Shores of Araby That Night..."

260
00:23:22,282 --> 00:23:24,182
"That Night With You."

261
00:23:25,119 --> 00:23:28,555
<i>I can't forget the night we met</i>

262
00:23:28,722 --> 00:23:31,885
<i>On the shores of Araby</i>

263
00:23:32,326 --> 00:23:35,591
<i>The moon lit up the sky</i>

264
00:23:35,762 --> 00:23:38,697
<i>And love lit up your eye</i>

265
00:23:38,866 --> 00:23:40,629
- Hold it, wait a minute.
- Yeah, hold it.

266
00:23:40,801 --> 00:23:43,395
- Who wrote that lyric?
- Well, I did.

267
00:23:43,570 --> 00:23:45,094
Words and music both.

268
00:23:46,406 --> 00:23:48,806
Well, you know, you haven't got
an Arabian song there.

269
00:23:48,976 --> 00:23:50,341
- You don't think so?
- No.

270
00:23:50,511 --> 00:23:52,741
- Play it again, will you?
- Sure.

271
00:23:56,550 --> 00:23:58,984
No, no. It's more like Dixie.
A Dixie tune.

272
00:23:59,153 --> 00:24:02,884
Maybe Mississippi, Alabama, Tennessee.

273
00:24:03,123 --> 00:24:04,420
Sure. Look.

274
00:24:04,591 --> 00:24:07,458
<i>Da-da-da-da in Tennessee</i>

275
00:24:09,329 --> 00:24:12,457
Gee, that's swell, Mr. Kalmar.
Tennessee.

276
00:24:12,633 --> 00:24:14,658
Well, you boys go right ahead.

277
00:24:14,835 --> 00:24:17,429
- Take all day if you want.
- Okay, Al. Great.

278
00:24:17,604 --> 00:24:18,866
Let me see.

279
00:24:19,473 --> 00:24:22,408
<i>Da-da-da-da in Tennessee</i>

280
00:24:29,283 --> 00:24:30,807
Say, don't I know you?

281
00:24:31,485 --> 00:24:33,476
Well, I don't think so, Mr. Kalmar.

282
00:24:36,390 --> 00:24:39,257
<i>Da-da-da-da in Tennessee</i>

283
00:24:39,426 --> 00:24:41,121
<i>Down among</i>...

284
00:24:43,497 --> 00:24:44,794
You worked here long?

285
00:24:45,365 --> 00:24:47,799
Oh, for a couple of months,
Mr. Kalmar.

286
00:24:49,770 --> 00:24:53,137
- Have a cigar.
- Oh, gee, thanks.

287
00:24:53,974 --> 00:24:57,603
<i>I wanna be in Tennessee</i>

288
00:24:57,778 --> 00:25:00,838
That's it. Try it.

00:25:04,051 --> 00:25:07,316
<i>I wanna be in Tennessee</i>

290
00:25:15,095 --> 00:25:18,462
That ought to do it.
Here, take it from the top.

291
00:25:22,703 --> 00:25:25,604
<i>I wanna be in Tennessee</i>

297
00:25:40,988 --> 00:25:46,858

299
00:25:50,030 --> 00:25:52,965

Gosh, that's wonderful, Mr. Kendall.

307
00:26:15,822 --> 00:26:17,289
Thanks.

308
00:26:19,660 --> 00:26:22,185
Kendall? Oh, I remember now.

309
00:26:22,362 --> 00:26:25,160
The pigeons, the rabbits.
Oh, I remember you!

00:26:25,332 --> 00:26:27,129
Please, Mr. Kendall...
I mean, Mr. Kalmar.

311
00:26:27,301 --> 00:26:30,464
You pin-headed baseball player.
Do you realize what you did that night?

312
00:26:30,637 --> 00:26:32,036
- It was the goose.
- Goose?

313
00:26:32,205 --> 00:26:34,298
Goose? Five hundred people
out front and...

314
00:26:34,474 --> 00:26:36,806
You don't know that goose.
He was the meanest thing...

315
00:26:36,977 --> 00:26:40,208
I knew I remembered that face.
I got a bad feeling the second I saw you.

316
00:26:40,380 --> 00:26:43,110
You're a menace. Run away and hide
before you do real damage.

317
00:26:43,283 --> 00:26:44,477
Let bygones be bygones.

318
00:26:44,651 --> 00:26:47,381
Get away from me. I should
write a song with a jinx like you.

319
00:26:47,554 --> 00:26:50,489
Here. As far as I'm concerned,
it never left Araby.

320
00:26:50,657 --> 00:26:52,352
Goose.

321
00:27:36,837 --> 00:27:38,702
Oh, hello, Mr. Kalmar.
I got your message.

322
00:27:38,872 --> 00:27:40,134
You write this ad?

323
00:27:40,307 --> 00:27:43,208
"The nation's number one song hit,
'My Sunny Tennessee'...

324
00:27:43,377 --> 00:27:47,404
...by that sensational new writing team,
Bert Kalmar and Harry Ruby."

325
00:27:47,581 --> 00:27:50,982
- Well, yeah, you see, l...
- Who made you my partner?

326
00:27:51,151 --> 00:27:52,880
- Well, nobody, but...
- Now, listen, kid.

327
00:27:53,053 --> 00:27:55,180
You might as well understand
something right now.

328
00:27:55,355 --> 00:27:57,755
Because I wrote one song with you
doesn't make us roommates.

329
00:27:57,924 --> 00:27:59,357
I'm not teaming up with anybody.

330
00:27:59,526 --> 00:28:01,721
Soon as I can swing this leg again,
I'd be back in vaudeville.

331
00:28:01,895 --> 00:28:04,864
Until then, I'll write with anyone
who happens to have a good tune.

332
00:28:05,031 --> 00:28:07,591
- Now, is that clear?
- Sure, that's very clear, Mr. Kalmar.

333
00:28:07,768 --> 00:28:10,396
Okay.
Where are the doughnuts?

334
00:28:10,670 --> 00:28:12,501
Thanks, Johnnie.

335
00:28:13,874 --> 00:28:16,434
Well, got any new tunes?

336
00:28:17,077 --> 00:28:20,808
As a matter of fact, I've got a tune
but I haven't thought of words for it yet.

337
00:28:20,981 --> 00:28:22,505
Good.

338
00:28:23,784 --> 00:28:26,719
My spikes. Al Schacht gave me those.

339
00:28:26,887 --> 00:28:29,151
Al Schacht.
He's a pitcher in the big league.

340
00:28:29,489 --> 00:28:32,356
Maybe you've heard of him?
Al Schacht?

341
00:28:32,526 --> 00:28:35,962
- Play the tune.
- Sure.

342
00:28:47,607 --> 00:28:49,905
Hey, have you got any
with chocolate on top?

343
00:28:50,076 --> 00:28:51,805
Coming up.

344
00:28:53,180 --> 00:28:54,807
You don't like it, huh?

345
00:28:54,981 --> 00:28:56,710
Sure, sure. It's a nice little tune.

346
00:28:56,983 --> 00:28:59,008
You ought to do something
with it sometime.

347
00:28:59,186 --> 00:29:01,416
You ought to do something
with that shirt too.

348
00:29:02,189 --> 00:29:04,657
Real silk, $4.

349
00:29:05,292 --> 00:29:06,782
You got any other tunes?

350
00:29:06,960 --> 00:29:09,690
Well... Let's see, I...

351
00:29:11,431 --> 00:29:13,865
Well, don't pull a ligament.
You know...

352
00:29:14,034 --> 00:29:16,696
...there hasn't been a good
Japanese song for quite a while.

353
00:29:16,870 --> 00:29:19,202
Got something here
I thought might work out.

354
00:29:19,372 --> 00:29:21,431
I call it "So Long, Oo-long."

355
00:29:21,608 --> 00:29:23,667
I figured the rhythm
is something like this:

356
00:29:23,844 --> 00:29:28,304
<i>So long, Oo-long</i>
<i>How long you gonna be gone?</i>

357
00:29:29,082 --> 00:29:30,549
You got something to fit that?

358
00:29:31,518 --> 00:29:33,850
Well, let's see.

359
00:29:34,154 --> 00:29:35,781
How about this?

360
00:29:45,232 --> 00:29:47,462
Wait a minute. Try that again, will you?

361
00:29:47,801 --> 00:29:50,827
<i>So long, Oo-long</i>

362
00:29:51,304 --> 00:29:56,105
<i>How long you gonna be gone?</i>

363
00:29:56,476 --> 00:29:59,001
Now, wait a minute.
That's the same tune you just played.

364
00:29:59,179 --> 00:30:00,441
Well, I know it.

365
00:30:00,614 --> 00:30:02,479
Are you trying to put something
over on me?

366
00:30:02,649 --> 00:30:05,174
- Well, no, I thought it would fit.
- Well, it doesn't fit.

367
00:30:05,352 --> 00:30:07,582
What's the matter with you,
you only got one tune?

368
00:30:07,754 --> 00:30:11,155
- I got plenty of tunes in me.
- Well, I've only heard one tune.

369
00:30:11,324 --> 00:30:14,919
Yeah, I know.
Right now, all I got is one rotten tune.

370
00:30:23,036 --> 00:30:24,867
Take it easy, kid.
Now, don't get excited.

371
00:30:25,038 --> 00:30:27,905
- Don't get excited.
- Who's excited? I'm not excited.

372
00:30:28,074 --> 00:30:29,473
I'll tell you what I'll do.

373
00:30:29,643 --> 00:30:32,737
I'll leave this lyric. If you come up
with something, give me a ring.

374
00:30:32,913 --> 00:30:35,507
If you don't, well, don't worry.

375
00:30:35,682 --> 00:30:37,377
See you around.

376
00:31:04,911 --> 00:31:08,403
<i>So long, Oo-long</i>
<i>How long you gonna be gone?</i>

377
00:31:08,748 --> 00:31:11,376
<i>Your little Japanee</i>

378
00:31:11,551 --> 00:31:14,384
<i>Will be waiting</i>
<i>Underneath the bamboo tree</i>

379
00:31:14,554 --> 00:31:19,890
<i>So don't be too long, Oo-long</i>
<i>I'll long while you're away</i>

380
00:31:20,160 --> 00:31:25,223
<i>Waiting for the day</i>
<i>When you come back to me</i>

381
00:31:25,865 --> 00:31:28,299
<i>I'll sit and sigh</i>

382
00:31:28,468 --> 00:31:31,335
<i>'Neath the oriental sky</i>

383
00:31:31,605 --> 00:31:36,599
<i>Each day that I</i>
<i>Am left alone</i>

384
00:31:36,776 --> 00:31:38,107
<i>In Nagasaki</i>

385
00:31:38,278 --> 00:31:42,305
<i>So long, Oo-long</i>
<i>How long you gonna roam?</i>

386
00:31:42,882 --> 00:31:46,113
<i>Please don't be too long</i>
<i>Oo-long, so long</i>

387
00:31:46,286 --> 00:31:48,720
<i>Hurry back home</i>

388
00:31:49,723 --> 00:31:52,385
<i>Ming Toy</i>
<i>Loved a boy</i>

389
00:31:52,559 --> 00:31:55,153
<i>Happy little Japanee</i>

390
00:31:55,328 --> 00:31:57,762
<i>Oo-long was his name</i>

391
00:31:58,164 --> 00:32:00,724
<i>Set her heart aflame</i>

392
00:32:01,001 --> 00:32:06,371
- <i>One day, he say</i>
- <i>Soon I got to go away</i>

393
00:32:06,539 --> 00:32:09,201
- <i>When he leave</i>
- <i>Ming Toy grieve</i>

394
00:32:09,376 --> 00:32:11,037
<i>Everybody hear her say</i>

395
00:32:11,211 --> 00:32:13,771
<i>I'll sit and sigh</i>

396
00:32:13,947 --> 00:32:16,677
<i>'Neath the oriental sky</i>

397
00:32:16,850 --> 00:32:22,220
<i>Each day that I</i>
<i>Am left alone</i>

398
00:32:22,389 --> 00:32:23,583
<i>In Nagasaki</i>

00:32:23,757 --> 00:32:27,989
<i>So long, Oo-long</i>
<i>How long you going to roam?</i>

400
00:32:28,161 --> 00:32:31,324
<i>Please don't be too long</i>
<i>Oo-long, so long</i>

401
00:32:31,498 --> 00:32:34,865
<i>Hurry back home</i>

402
00:32:35,035 --> 00:32:37,060
- Hi, boys.
- Yes, sir, 10 cents.

403
00:32:37,237 --> 00:32:39,797
Right. We have...
No, no, no. The Palace tonight.

404
00:32:40,073 --> 00:32:42,371
I fixed it with Mrs. Carter DeHaven
to hear your song.

405
00:32:42,542 --> 00:32:43,873
- Well...
- Not that, the new one.

406
00:32:44,044 --> 00:32:46,103
If she likes it,
she'll introduce it next week.

407
00:32:46,279 --> 00:32:50,443
<i>Who's sorry now?</i>

408
00:32:52,085 --> 00:32:55,145
<i>Who's sorry now?</i>

409
00:32:57,023 --> 00:33:00,550
<i>Whose heart is aching</i>

410
00:33:00,727 --> 00:33:06,757
<i>For breaking each vow?</i>

411
00:33:06,933 --> 00:33:11,893
<i>Who's sad and blue?</i>

412
00:33:12,072 --> 00:33:16,168
<i>Who's crying too?</i>

413
00:33:16,342 --> 00:33:24,113
<i>Just like I cried over you</i>

414
00:33:27,087 --> 00:33:32,184
<i>Right to the end</i>

415
00:33:32,525 --> 00:33:36,962
<i>Just like a friend</i>

416
00:33:37,130 --> 00:33:41,260
<i>I tried to warn you</i>

417
00:33:41,434 --> 00:33:44,665
<i>Somehow</i>

418
00:33:46,806 --> 00:33:52,369
<i>You had your way</i>

419
00:33:52,545 --> 00:33:57,448
<i>Now you must pay</i>

420
00:33:57,617 --> 00:34:05,114
<i>I'm glad that you're sorry now</i>

421
00:34:08,061 --> 00:34:13,363
<i>Right to the end</i>

422
00:34:13,533 --> 00:34:18,527
<i>Just like a friend</i>

423
00:34:18,705 --> 00:34:22,402
<i>I tried to warn you</i>

424
00:34:22,575 --> 00:34:26,875
<i>Somehow</i>

425
00:34:27,680 --> 00:34:33,243
<i>You had your way</i>

426
00:34:33,920 --> 00:34:39,324
<i>Now you must pay</i>

427
00:34:39,492 --> 00:34:41,983
<i>I'm glad</i>

428
00:34:42,162 --> 00:34:51,002
<i>That you're sorry now</i>

429
00:34:51,771 --> 00:34:52,999
Oh, that's great.

430
00:34:53,173 --> 00:34:55,539
Looks like another hit.
You're making a habit of it.

431
00:34:55,708 --> 00:34:57,642
- Thank you.
- We'll introduce it next week.

432
00:34:57,811 --> 00:35:00,803
- Oh, good, thanks.
- Oh, Bert, how is your knee?

433
00:35:00,980 --> 00:35:04,347
- Oh, better, better. Thank you.
- Wonderful. I'm glad. Excuse me.

434
00:35:04,517 --> 00:35:06,781
- Boys, it was just great, that's all.
- Bert, swell.

435
00:35:06,953 --> 00:35:11,014
Bert, I want a copy to send on to Jessie.
Can't you hear her sing it?

436
00:35:11,224 --> 00:35:14,421
- Yeah, sure.
- It was like it was written for her.

437
00:35:14,594 --> 00:35:17,188
Oh, I suppose
you haven't heard the news.

438
00:35:17,463 --> 00:35:19,260
- No.
- Well, it's not settled yet.

439
00:35:19,432 --> 00:35:21,957
But she may team up
with Bill Courtney next season.

440
00:35:22,135 --> 00:35:24,603
They'll do an act
like she used to do with you.

441
00:35:26,372 --> 00:35:29,808
Well, it's not definite yet.

442
00:35:30,043 --> 00:35:32,511
They ought to do all right.
He's a very talented guy.

443
00:35:32,679 --> 00:35:34,010
- Yeah.
- See you later, Charlie.

444
00:35:34,180 --> 00:35:36,045
Yeah, yeah. Good night.

445
00:35:36,916 --> 00:35:39,976
Oh, me and my big mouth.

446
00:35:40,153 --> 00:35:43,247
Yeah, he doesn't talk about her
very much anymore.

447
00:35:44,390 --> 00:35:46,051
Hey, where is she playing next week?

448
00:35:46,226 --> 00:35:47,750
- Jessie?
- Yeah.

449
00:35:47,927 --> 00:35:51,192
Montreal, at Queen's Theatre. Why?

450
00:35:51,397 --> 00:35:53,388
I'll see you later.

451
00:37:48,781 --> 00:37:52,273
<i>Where did you get that girl?</i>
<i>Oh, you lucky devil</i>

452
00:38:25,852 --> 00:38:28,446
What's the matter?
Can't a fella dance if he feels like it?

453
00:38:28,621 --> 00:38:31,089
- Well, I didn't say anything.
- What are you gaping at?

454
00:38:31,257 --> 00:38:33,817
I'm not gaping.
I always look this way.

455
00:38:33,993 --> 00:38:36,325
- You hurt your leg again, Bert?
- No. It's all right.

456
00:38:36,496 --> 00:38:39,727
- I just gotta cut out those knee drops.
- Yeah.

457
00:38:39,899 --> 00:38:42,993
You know what I think?
We ought to take a little vacation.

458
00:38:43,169 --> 00:38:45,262
I mean it.
We've been working too hard.

459
00:38:45,438 --> 00:38:47,668
We're tired.
It would do us good.

460
00:38:47,840 --> 00:38:54,245
We could go to Miami Beach
or New Orleans, Hot Springs or Montreal.

461
00:38:55,815 --> 00:38:57,180
Why Montreal?

462
00:38:57,350 --> 00:38:59,818
Oh, no reason. Nice little town.

463
00:38:59,986 --> 00:39:03,149
Might be a nice place to work on
that play you're always talking about.

464
00:39:03,322 --> 00:39:05,256
Besides, I got
some relatives up there...

465
00:39:05,425 --> 00:39:07,518
...and we could get
a good home-cooked meal.

466
00:39:09,195 --> 00:39:11,356
Hey, Harry, I gave you a bum steer.

467
00:39:11,531 --> 00:39:14,159
Jessie is not in Montreal next week,
it's Buffalo.

468
00:39:14,333 --> 00:39:16,028
Oh, thanks.

469
00:39:18,571 --> 00:39:22,029
Well, I got relatives in Buffalo too.

470

<i>Come on, papa</i>
<i>Hop in the motorcar</i>

477
00:40:07,720 --> 00:40:11,884
<i>Sit by mama</i>
<i>And hold the hand</i>

<i>What they call the deuce</i>

<i>I pooh-pooh you</i>

488
00:40:49,662 --> 00:40:52,426
<i>But when you're in the car</i>
<i>Don't go too far</i>

Thank you.

493
00:42:01,767 --> 00:42:04,133
And for my next number...

494
00:42:10,243 --> 00:42:11,710
Ladies and gentlemen...

495
00:42:11,877 --> 00:42:15,108
...we have two very well-known
songwriters with us tonight.

496
00:42:15,281 --> 00:42:19,615
Mr. Bert Kalmar and Mr. Harry Ruby.

497
00:42:23,322 --> 00:42:26,485
Would you like to hear them
sing one of their numbers?

498
00:42:32,832 --> 00:42:34,823
- Hello, Jess.
- Hello, Bert.

499
00:42:35,001 --> 00:42:36,628
- Hi, Harry.
- Hi, Jessie.

500
00:42:36,802 --> 00:42:39,362
Well, what shall we do?
"Nevertheless"?

501
00:42:39,538 --> 00:42:41,028

516
00:44:22,375 --> 00:44:23,865
Yeah.

517
00:45:01,480 --> 00:45:02,879
Hold it, Harry!

518
00:45:03,048 --> 00:45:05,039
- Harry, wait!
- Wait!

519
00:45:06,185 --> 00:45:08,847
Early riser, huh?
Ducked out without saying goodbye.

520
00:45:09,021 --> 00:45:10,750
Guys, you both
shouldn't have done this.

521
00:45:10,923 --> 00:45:12,982
- You're on your honeymoon.
- Here's some candy.

522
00:45:13,159 --> 00:45:14,922
- Oh, thanks, Bert.
- And a little fruit.

523
00:45:15,094 --> 00:45:18,552
Oh, well, that will come in handy.
I like a little fruit once in a while.

524
00:45:18,731 --> 00:45:21,131
Do you mind if I kiss the bride?

525
00:45:22,234 --> 00:45:24,134
Bye, Harry.
And thanks for everything.

526
00:45:24,303 --> 00:45:25,736
You know what I mean.

527
00:45:25,905 --> 00:45:27,338
Oh, here, from me to you.

528
00:45:27,506 --> 00:45:29,633
Well, now, thanks.
You shouldn't have done that.

529
00:45:29,809 --> 00:45:33,108
- I wanted to.
- Oh, here's some newspapers.

530
00:45:33,279 --> 00:45:35,747
And read a book sometime.
It might improve your brain.

531
00:45:35,915 --> 00:45:38,611
All aboard!

532
00:45:38,784 --> 00:45:40,217
Well...

533
00:45:40,753 --> 00:45:43,244
We wrote a lot of good songs together,
didn't we, Bert?

534
00:45:43,422 --> 00:45:45,856
- We sure did, Harry.
- Well, bye, Jessie.

535
00:45:46,025 --> 00:45:47,253
- Bye, Harry.
- Bert.

536
00:45:47,426 --> 00:45:48,825
Bye, kid.

537
00:45:49,462 --> 00:45:51,191
And good luck to both of you.

538
00:45:51,363 --> 00:45:53,422
- Good luck to you, kid.
- Don't forget to write.

539
00:45:53,599 --> 00:45:56,796
Yeah, I'll keep in touch
with your bookings through <i>Variety</i>.

540
00:45:57,203 --> 00:45:59,728
- So long.
- Bye-bye.

541
00:46:26,499 --> 00:46:29,024
Not so very hungry this morning, sir?

542
00:46:29,201 --> 00:46:32,932
- No, I'll just have some more coffee.
- And a couple of doughnuts.

543
00:46:33,105 --> 00:46:36,404
- Yeah, a couple of doughnuts.
- Yes, sir.

544
00:46:38,344 --> 00:46:40,642
- Harry.
- You alone? Why don't you join us?

545
00:46:40,813 --> 00:46:42,371
Well, you're in Buffalo.

546
00:46:42,548 --> 00:46:45,312
We canceled Buffalo, we're going
on a honeymoon. Toast, Bert?

547
00:46:45,484 --> 00:46:49,352
Thanks. We've also canceled Syracuse and
Rochester and 40 weeks next season.

548
00:46:49,522 --> 00:46:52,116
That's a long honeymoon.
Where are you going, up the Congo?

549
00:46:52,291 --> 00:46:55,021
We might buy a little house
somewhere and settle down.

550
00:46:55,194 --> 00:46:58,322
- How about Pelham, Bert?
- Pelham's nice. Coffee, dear?

551
00:46:58,497 --> 00:47:01,261
- Yes, warm it.
- Well, what about the team?

552
00:47:01,433 --> 00:47:02,798
Yeah, what about the team?

553
00:47:03,135 --> 00:47:05,695
I don't know. Do you think
it should be Kalmar and Ruby...

554
00:47:05,871 --> 00:47:07,236
...or Ruby and Kalmar?

555
00:47:07,706 --> 00:47:08,934
Either way.

556
00:47:09,108 --> 00:47:11,167
First billing doesn't mean
much to songwriters.

557
00:47:11,343 --> 00:47:14,278
- Cream, dear?
- Yeah, just a little.

558
00:47:14,680 --> 00:47:20,346
You mean you're not gonna do the act,
that the team's Bert and me?

559
00:47:23,689 --> 00:47:26,715
Oh, Jessie, you're wonderful.

560
00:47:27,293 --> 00:47:29,056
Look, it's okay to admire my wife.

561
00:47:29,228 --> 00:47:32,061
Would you mind taking your elbow
out of my butter?

562
00:47:32,898 --> 00:47:34,593
Oh, I'm sorry, Bert.

563

00:50:38,851 --> 00:50:45,154
<i>Wouldn't be lonely</i>
<i>If I were only all alone</i>

615
00:50:45,924 --> 00:50:52,420
<i>With you</i>

616
00:50:59,138 --> 00:51:00,662
- Hello, honey.
- How are you, dear?

617
00:51:00,839 --> 00:51:03,637
- Miss Lordel, Mr. and Mrs. Kalmar.
- Hello.

618
00:51:03,809 --> 00:51:05,640
- Jessie, Bert, Terry.
- How do you do?

619
00:51:05,811 --> 00:51:07,938
- Hello, Terry.
- I'm glad to know all of you.

620
00:51:08,113 --> 00:51:11,446
Mr. Kalmar, I wanna tell you about
that number of yours, it's just terrif.

621
00:51:11,617 --> 00:51:13,847
- It's sensashe.
- Thanks. You certainly sang it.

622
00:51:14,019 --> 00:51:17,250
Oh, thank you.
Of course, Snooky rehearsed me in it.

623
00:51:17,422 --> 00:51:18,980
- Snooky?
- Snooky.

624
00:51:19,158 --> 00:51:21,456
This is Snooky.

625
00:51:21,660 --> 00:51:25,653
- Hi, Snooky.
- Oh, she calls me Snooky.

626
00:51:25,831 --> 00:51:29,892
Isn't he sweet?
Oh, I could just eat him up.

627
00:51:31,837 --> 00:51:33,498
- Light me, please?
- I beg your pardon?

628
00:51:33,672 --> 00:51:38,200
- Light me?
- Oh, yeah, of course. Sure.

629
00:51:42,548 --> 00:51:44,982
Oh, that's terrif.
Do you know any more tricks?

630
00:51:45,150 --> 00:51:46,378
Yeah. l...

631
00:51:46,552 --> 00:51:49,248
I understand congratulations
are in order, Miss Lordel.

632
00:51:49,421 --> 00:51:51,981
Oh, well, thank you,
but I haven't got the part yet.

633
00:51:52,157 --> 00:51:54,853
She's trying out for a part
in the <i>Follies</i>.

634
00:51:55,027 --> 00:51:58,394
- Well, I really meant about you and Harry.
- Oh, Harry.

635
00:51:58,564 --> 00:52:00,623
I thought you weren't
gonna tell anybody yet.

636
00:52:00,799 --> 00:52:03,734
They're my best friends,
I've got to tell them.

637
00:52:04,136 --> 00:52:06,866
Oh, that music.
Oh, I've simply got to dance.

638
00:52:07,072 --> 00:52:09,063
- Will you?
- Sure.

639
00:52:09,241 --> 00:52:11,573
Oh, I can't dance in this.
Look, I've got to change.

640
00:52:11,743 --> 00:52:14,644
Now, you be sitting right there
when I get back.

641
00:52:14,813 --> 00:52:16,303
You hear?

642
00:52:17,549 --> 00:52:19,244
Bye.

643
00:52:20,152 --> 00:52:21,881
What do you think of her?

644
00:52:22,054 --> 00:52:24,249
Well, she's very peppy, isn't she?

645
00:52:24,423 --> 00:52:26,891
Yeah, she's got a lot of life.

646
00:52:27,426 --> 00:52:30,361
Boys. That's Phil Goodman
I'm sitting with...

647
00:52:30,529 --> 00:52:32,087
...the big theatrical producer.

648
00:52:32,264 --> 00:52:34,596
He loved your song
and he wants it for his new show.

649
00:52:34,766 --> 00:52:36,097
- Yeah?
- And that's not all.

650
00:52:36,268 --> 00:52:37,997
He wants you
to write the whole score.

651
00:52:38,270 --> 00:52:39,635
- A Broadway show?
- Sure.

652
00:52:39,805 --> 00:52:41,773
Words and music by Kalmar and Ruby.

653
00:52:41,940 --> 00:52:43,430
Who did it, huh? Who did it?

654
00:52:43,609 --> 00:52:46,578
- Let me shake the hand of the man...
- Terry. Terry singing our song.

655
00:52:46,745 --> 00:52:48,645
That's who did it.

656
00:52:54,586 --> 00:52:56,213
Oh, Bert.

657
00:52:58,156 --> 00:53:02,889
<i>You're here with me</i>
<i>I'm here with you</i>

658
00:53:03,061 --> 00:53:06,963
<i>We need no secret rendezvous</i>

659
00:53:07,132 --> 00:53:11,296
<i>We'll find romance</i>
<i>Where e'er we chance</i>

660
00:53:11,470 --> 00:53:13,768
<i>To be</i>

661
00:53:14,706 --> 00:53:19,075
<i>The sweetest theme</i>
<i>Runs through my dream</i>

662
00:53:19,244 --> 00:53:23,340
<i>Each night I seem to see</i>

663
00:53:23,882 --> 00:53:29,718
<i>A home for two</i>
<i>In view for you</i>

664
00:53:29,922 --> 00:53:35,019
<i>And me</i>

665
00:53:35,260 --> 00:53:38,821
- She could do the Phyllis part.
- Yeah.

666
00:53:38,997 --> 00:53:40,862
What is your name again?

667
00:53:41,033 --> 00:53:43,797
- Eileen Percy.
- Any experience, Miss Percy?

668
00:53:43,969 --> 00:53:47,302
- Stock mostly, two seasons.
- I'd like you to read something for us.

669
00:53:47,472 --> 00:53:49,872
If you can handle lines,
I'd say the part's yours.

670
00:53:50,042 --> 00:53:51,373
- Thank you.
- Mr. Goodman!

671
00:53:51,543 --> 00:53:53,477
Mr. Goodman, boy, are we in luck.

672
00:53:53,645 --> 00:53:56,011
I just found out
that Terry Lordel is available.

673
00:53:56,181 --> 00:53:57,739
Terry Lordel?

674
00:53:57,916 --> 00:53:59,884
Yeah, that girl at the club
the other night.

675
00:54:00,052 --> 00:54:01,314
She's just a singer.

676
00:54:01,486 --> 00:54:03,681
She can sing. She can act.
She can do anything.

677
00:54:03,855 --> 00:54:06,415
She'd be great for the Phyllis part.
Wouldn't she, Bert?

678
00:54:06,591 --> 00:54:09,992
- I don't know, Harry.
- Let her read the part, that's all I ask.

679
00:54:10,162 --> 00:54:14,121
- When could you get her in?
- Anytime. Hey, Terry!

680
00:54:17,102 --> 00:54:18,763
Come in here!

681
00:54:26,044 --> 00:54:30,981
<i>All alone Monday</i>
<i>Singing the blues</i>

682
00:54:31,183 --> 00:54:35,517
<i>All alone Tuesday</i>
<i>Reading the news</i>

683
00:54:35,687 --> 00:54:40,750
<i>Staring and blinking</i>
<i>Sitting there thinking</i>

684
00:54:40,926 --> 00:54:44,418
<i>All alone</i>

685
00:54:45,464 --> 00:54:49,992
<i>On the shelf Wednesday</i>
<i>Till the dawn comes</i>

686
00:54:50,202 --> 00:54:54,730
<i>By myself Thursday</i>
<i>Twirling my thumbs</i>

687
00:54:54,940 --> 00:54:57,408
<i>Friday is my day</i>

688
00:54:57,576 --> 00:55:02,377
<i>So I spend Friday all alone</i>

689
00:55:02,581 --> 00:55:05,846
<i>On Saturday I</i>

690
00:55:06,018 --> 00:55:11,923
<i>Dread the coming of Sunday</i>

691
00:55:13,492 --> 00:55:19,988
<i>Monday the week starts anew</i>

692
00:55:20,999 --> 00:55:27,427
<i>I'm certain I could endure</i>
<i>The week to the end</i>

693
00:55:27,606 --> 00:55:31,940
<i>And I am sure</i>
<i>The days that I spend</i>

694
00:55:32,110 --> 00:55:38,606
<i>Wouldn't be lonely</i>
<i>If I were only all alone</i>

695
00:55:38,984 --> 00:55:41,578
<i>With you</i>

696
00:55:41,753 --> 00:55:43,618
You're the understudy, huh?

697
00:55:43,789 --> 00:55:47,486
It must be a pretty tough job.
You're so anxious to get out there.

698
00:55:47,659 --> 00:55:50,093
I wouldn't worry,
you'll get your chance.

699
00:55:50,262 --> 00:55:53,288
- Well, I've already had my chance.
- How's that?

700
00:55:53,465 --> 00:55:56,901
Well, I almost had a good part once,
but they gave it to someone else.

701
00:55:57,069 --> 00:55:59,230
Oh, that's a shame.

702
00:55:59,471 --> 00:56:02,531
I wouldn't worry about it.
Somebody's bound to get sick some night.

703
00:56:02,707 --> 00:56:06,370
- Not her.
- No, not Terry. She's plenty healthy.

704
00:56:07,212 --> 00:56:09,840
Besides, I won't be here much longer.

705
00:56:10,015 --> 00:56:11,676
I'm going out to Hollywood.

706
00:56:11,850 --> 00:56:13,545
Well, movies, huh?

707
00:56:13,718 --> 00:56:16,050
Well, I wish you all the luck
in the world.

708
00:56:16,254 --> 00:56:17,619
Thanks.

709
00:56:17,789 --> 00:56:20,223
Ever anything I can do,
let me know.

710
00:56:23,728 --> 00:56:25,992
That's very nice of you, Mr. Ruby.
Good night.

711
00:56:26,198 --> 00:56:27,756
Good night.

712
00:56:40,812 --> 00:56:44,213
- Nice going, Terry.
- Oh, thank you, Mr. Kalmar.

713
00:56:57,696 --> 00:56:59,288
Snooky.

714
00:57:03,535 --> 00:57:05,264
Oh, fine.

715
00:57:15,046 --> 00:57:18,209
- How's the third act coming?
- It isn't.

716
00:57:18,383 --> 00:57:21,784
- I'm worried about him.
- Who, Snooky?

717
00:57:21,953 --> 00:57:25,252
That girl is all wrong for him.
She'll ruin his life.

718
00:57:25,423 --> 00:57:27,891
He's pretty crazy about her.

719
00:57:29,094 --> 00:57:30,959
He's not responsible.

720
00:57:31,129 --> 00:57:33,689
He ought to be chained up someplace.

721
00:57:33,999 --> 00:57:37,230
You know, if Harry left town for a while
that girl would be engaged...

722
00:57:37,402 --> 00:57:39,233
...to four different fellas
within a week.

723
00:57:39,404 --> 00:57:41,895
Maybe we could get him out of town.

724
00:57:42,073 --> 00:57:44,200
How?
Ship him off to boarding school?

725
00:57:44,376 --> 00:57:47,243
He's a big boy now.
Wears long pants.

726
00:57:47,579 --> 00:57:49,638
Could Al Schacht help?

727
00:57:49,948 --> 00:57:51,176
Al Schacht?

728
00:57:51,349 --> 00:57:53,442
That friend of Harry's,
the big-league pitcher.

729
00:57:53,852 --> 00:57:55,820
Al Schacht is down in Florida
with the team.

730
00:57:55,987 --> 00:57:57,716
How could he help?

731
00:57:59,524 --> 00:58:02,493
- Well, he could ask Harry...
- Wait a minute.

732
00:58:03,428 --> 00:58:06,864
I'll get Al to invite Harry down to Florida
to work out with the Senators.

733
00:58:07,065 --> 00:58:10,728
- Bert, that's exactly what I was saying...
- Say, that's an inspiration.

734
00:58:13,538 --> 00:58:17,065
Western Union, please.
Why didn't I think of it before?

735
00:58:18,476 --> 00:58:20,967
I really wouldn't know.

736
00:58:26,251 --> 00:58:29,812
- Hey, Al, get a load of this.
- Let's see it.

737
00:58:31,489 --> 00:58:34,219
Hey, Ruby, take it easy, will you?

738
00:58:35,727 --> 00:58:37,922
Come on, Al. Throw a fast one.

739
00:58:45,971 --> 00:58:48,269
Well, throw a slow one.

740
00:59:03,722 --> 00:59:05,087
- Hey, Harry!
- What's the matter?

741
00:59:05,257 --> 00:59:06,690
- You all right, huh?
- Hey, Harry.

742
00:59:06,858 --> 00:59:08,223
- You all right?
- Yeah, I'm okay.

743
00:59:08,393 --> 00:59:09,985
- You all right, Harry?
- I feel fine.

744
00:59:10,161 --> 00:59:12,322
- How are you feeling there?
- Hey.

745
00:59:13,131 --> 00:59:16,123
- Come on, I'll get it.
- Play ball. Play ball.

746
00:59:19,938 --> 00:59:21,235
Hit it!

747
00:59:21,406 --> 00:59:23,465
Nice going.

748
00:59:25,744 --> 00:59:27,678
Come on, Ruby!

749
00:59:35,420 --> 00:59:37,081
You moved it.

750
00:59:43,328 --> 00:59:45,387
Lay out. I'll take this one.

751
00:59:53,838 --> 00:59:55,430
- You all right?
- Yeah, I'm fine.

752
00:59:55,607 --> 00:59:57,632
Sure you're okay?

753
01:00:00,045 --> 01:00:02,309
Harry, want to try it again?

754
01:00:04,849 --> 01:00:07,716
- Harry!
- Bert. How are you?

755
01:00:07,886 --> 01:00:09,444
- You look great.
- I feel great.

756
01:00:09,621 --> 01:00:12,454
- Had a good time, huh?
- A little charley horse there.

757
01:00:12,657 --> 01:00:14,454
Where's Terry?
Didn't she get my wire?

758
01:00:14,626 --> 01:00:16,184
Come here, I got news for you.

759
01:00:16,361 --> 01:00:18,522
- She isn't sick?
- No.

760
01:00:18,697 --> 01:00:21,393
- She's married.
- Well, that's good.

761
01:00:22,500 --> 01:00:24,092
Married?

762
01:00:25,804 --> 01:00:28,398
- When?
- Saturday night after the show.

763
01:00:28,573 --> 01:00:31,474
Went to Greenwich
with a saxophone player.

764
01:00:31,943 --> 01:00:36,073
- I guess I shouldn't have left town.
- You made a wrong move, son.

765
01:00:36,247 --> 01:00:38,238
- Want a drink?
- Yeah.

766
01:00:38,416 --> 01:00:40,577
- What will it be?
- Grape juice, please.

767
01:00:40,752 --> 01:00:42,447
Make it two.

768
01:00:42,821 --> 01:00:44,345
Not to change the subject...

769
01:00:44,522 --> 01:00:46,717
...but I've been kind of busy
while you were away.

770
01:00:46,891 --> 01:00:49,883
- Saturday night, huh?
- Yeah. Look.

771
01:00:50,061 --> 01:00:53,258
- What's this?
- Play. My play. I finished it.

772
01:00:53,431 --> 01:00:55,729
Oh, swell, Bert.

773
01:00:55,934 --> 01:00:59,461
- They went to Greenwich, huh?
- Yeah. I want you to read it, Harry.

774
01:00:59,637 --> 01:01:01,104
- I'd like your opinion.
- Sure.

775
01:01:01,272 --> 01:01:03,968
I'm gonna produce it myself.
I'm putting up part of the cash.

776
01:01:04,142 --> 01:01:06,440
I got a broker from Wall Street
putting up the rest.

777
01:01:06,611 --> 01:01:09,273
A saxophone player, huh?

778
01:01:09,581 --> 01:01:11,515
You're not gonna let
this thing throw you.

779
01:01:11,683 --> 01:01:14,174
Because if you are,
I'm gonna feel terrible.

780
01:01:14,352 --> 01:01:16,286
Oh, why should you feel terrible, Bert?

781
01:01:16,454 --> 01:01:18,684
You had nothing to do with it.

782
01:01:28,433 --> 01:01:29,866
A saxophone player.

783
01:01:32,604 --> 01:01:34,970
I haven't slept a wink
since I read it.

784
01:01:35,140 --> 01:01:37,404
Look, Charlie,
I don't know anything about plays...

785
01:01:37,575 --> 01:01:40,043
...but do you think Bert
ought to produce this himself?

786
01:01:40,211 --> 01:01:42,270
- Nobody else will handle it.
- What do you mean?

787
01:01:42,447 --> 01:01:44,415
- This script been around to regular producers?
- Sure.

788
01:01:44,582 --> 01:01:46,174
- What do they say?
- Nothing much.

789
01:01:46,351 --> 01:01:48,819
A couple of them say
it will be a sure-fire flop.

790
01:01:48,987 --> 01:01:50,511
Well, did you tell Bert?

791
01:01:50,688 --> 01:01:53,919
- You tell him.
- Oh, fine. That's all I'd have to do.

792
01:01:54,092 --> 01:01:56,322
Look, I'm not worried
about the dough he'll lose.

793
01:01:56,494 --> 01:01:58,052
I'm thinking of Bert, his pride.

794
01:01:58,229 --> 01:02:02,529
He's higher than a kite on this thing,
and if it flops, he'll never get over it.

795
01:02:02,700 --> 01:02:05,692
- Well, what do you want from me?
- I...

796
01:02:05,870 --> 01:02:08,338
Look, can Bert handle this
without that Wall Street guy?

797
01:02:08,506 --> 01:02:10,599
- Not a chance.
- Well, then, call him off.

798
01:02:10,775 --> 01:02:12,970
Tell him the play is no good.
Get him to pull out.

799
01:02:13,144 --> 01:02:14,839
Harry, I can't.

800
01:02:15,013 --> 01:02:17,846
If Bert is gonna fall on his face,
maybe we just better let him.

801
01:02:18,016 --> 01:02:20,712
He wouldn't let it happen to me.

802
01:02:21,119 --> 01:02:24,520
Look, get that broker on the phone.
I'll talk to him myself.

803
01:02:31,062 --> 01:02:32,620
What do you mean, he pulled out?

804
01:02:32,797 --> 01:02:34,822
- Why would he pull out now?
- Bert, please.

805
01:02:34,999 --> 01:02:37,661
All I know is that he's out,
he doesn't want any part of it.

806
01:02:37,836 --> 01:02:39,531
Well, I'm still asking you why.

807
01:02:39,704 --> 01:02:42,935
Maybe Mr. Miller just decided
he didn't like the play anymore.

808
01:02:43,141 --> 01:02:45,234
- Was that it, Charlie?
- Yeah, just about.

809
01:02:45,510 --> 01:02:47,501
He's a broker.
What does he know about plays?

810
01:02:47,679 --> 01:02:49,613
Listen, I spent a lot of time
on that thing.

811
01:02:49,781 --> 01:02:52,341
It's not the first play I've written.
I've done six plays.

812
01:02:52,517 --> 01:02:54,712
I tore them up because
they weren't what I wanted.

813
01:02:54,886 --> 01:02:58,219
Now I've got something, I know it.
And a broker says it's no good.

814
01:02:58,389 --> 01:03:00,789
Oh, I thought
it was your first play, Bert.

815
01:03:01,559 --> 01:03:05,461
He hasn't talked much about it,
but he's worked very hard.

816
01:03:07,065 --> 01:03:09,829
Well, I'm no broker, but...

817
01:03:10,068 --> 01:03:12,798
Well, anything I've got,
you're welcome to, you know that.

818
01:03:12,971 --> 01:03:15,337
No, no, no. It's all right, forget it.

819
01:03:15,507 --> 01:03:18,271
I gotta go along.
I've gotta catch an act at the Fordham.

820
01:03:18,443 --> 01:03:20,274
- So long, Bert.
- So long, Charlie.

821
01:03:20,445 --> 01:03:22,777
- Harry.
- I'll see you later, Charlie.

822
01:03:24,949 --> 01:03:28,214
Oh, look, Bert. Now, you're not gonna let
this thing lick you, are you?

823
01:03:28,386 --> 01:03:30,854
Because if you do,
it's gonna lick me too.

824
01:03:31,055 --> 01:03:32,545
I'd feel awful.

825
01:03:33,558 --> 01:03:35,116
Why should you feel awful?

826
01:03:35,293 --> 01:03:38,285
Is it your fault a broker doesn't know
a good play when he sees it?

827
01:03:43,268 --> 01:03:44,496
Try it this way:

828
01:03:47,739 --> 01:03:51,038
- That ought to fix it.
- I don't think so.

829
01:03:54,779 --> 01:03:57,145
- Too many notes.
- It's not too many notes. Look...

830
01:03:57,315 --> 01:04:01,217
Hey, fellas, can we borrow
your piano just a minute?

831
01:04:01,452 --> 01:04:03,283
Well, listen.

832
01:04:05,056 --> 01:04:07,786
<i>I wanna be loved by you</i>

833
01:04:07,959 --> 01:04:12,589
<i>Just you and nobody else but you</i>

834
01:04:12,764 --> 01:04:17,758
<i>I wanna be loved by you alone</i>

835
01:04:23,875 --> 01:04:26,571
<i>I wanna be kissed by you</i>

836
01:04:26,744 --> 01:04:31,272
<i>Just you and nobody else but you</i>

837
01:04:31,449 --> 01:04:36,546
<i>I wanna be kissed by you alone</i>

838
01:04:45,196 --> 01:04:47,426
Yeah. Come on. Come with us.

839
01:04:52,670 --> 01:04:55,298
<i>I wanna be loved by you</i>

840
01:04:55,473 --> 01:05:00,001
<i>Just you and nobody else but you</i>

841
01:05:00,178 --> 01:05:05,377
<i>I wanna be loved by you alone</i>

842
01:05:07,986 --> 01:05:10,648
<i>I wanna be kissed by you</i>

843
01:05:10,822 --> 01:05:15,418
<i>Just you and nobody else but you</i>

844
01:05:15,593 --> 01:05:21,463
<i>Oh, I wanna be kissed by you alone</i>

845
01:05:21,666 --> 01:05:25,033
<i>I couldn't aspire</i>

846
01:05:25,203 --> 01:05:29,037
<i>To anything higher</i>

847
01:05:29,207 --> 01:05:31,767
<i>Than fill a desire</i>

848
01:05:31,943 --> 01:05:34,878
<i>To make you my own</i>

849
01:05:38,616 --> 01:05:41,346
<i>I wanna be loved by you</i>

850
01:05:41,519 --> 01:05:46,115
<i>Just you and nobody else but you</i>

851
01:05:46,290 --> 01:05:51,660
<i>Oh, I wanna be loved by you alone</i>

852
01:05:52,363 --> 01:05:56,129
<i>I couldn't aspire</i>

853
01:05:56,334 --> 01:06:00,100
<i>To anything higher</i>

854
01:06:00,304 --> 01:06:02,898
<i>Than fill a desire</i>

855
01:06:03,074 --> 01:06:07,135
<i>To make you my own</i>

856
01:06:09,681 --> 01:06:12,514
<i>I wanna be loved by you</i>

857
01:06:12,717 --> 01:06:17,347
<i>Just you and nobody else but you</i>

858
01:06:17,522 --> 01:06:21,515
<i>I wanna be loved by you</i>

859
01:06:34,405 --> 01:06:38,205
<i>Don't know the time</i>
<i>Day or the season</i>

860
01:06:38,376 --> 01:06:42,403
<i>I just know that I'm</i>
<i>Losin' my reason</i>

861
01:06:42,580 --> 01:06:44,775
<i>By fallin' in love</i>

862
01:06:50,822 --> 01:06:54,656
<i>Don't know the time</i>
<i>Day or the season</i>

863
01:06:54,826 --> 01:06:58,762
<i>I just know that I'm</i>
<i>Losin' my reason</i>

864
01:06:58,930 --> 01:07:02,764
<i>By fallin' in love</i>
<i>And since I'm in love</i>

865
01:07:02,934 --> 01:07:06,233
<i>I'm up in the clouds</i>

866
01:07:12,276 --> 01:07:15,336
- Harry, what is it?
- Hey. What's the matter?

867
01:07:15,513 --> 01:07:17,105
Steward said you wanted to see me.

868
01:07:17,281 --> 01:07:18,908
- You all right?
- Sure, I'm fine.

869
01:07:19,117 --> 01:07:21,051
Remember those lyrics
you wrote for Jessie?

870
01:07:21,219 --> 01:07:23,210
I think I got a tune for them.

871
01:07:23,554 --> 01:07:25,613
"Thinking of You."

872
01:07:26,224 --> 01:07:29,022
- You wrote it for me, Bert?
- Yeah. Yeah.

873
01:07:29,227 --> 01:07:31,787
I wanted to surprise you,
but not at 2:00 in the morning.

874
01:07:32,196 --> 01:07:35,893
I thought you'd be interested.
Go ahead, Jessie, sing it.

875
01:07:36,367 --> 01:07:42,863
<i>Why is it I spend the day</i>

876
01:07:43,841 --> 01:07:48,301
<i>Wake up and end the day</i>

877
01:07:48,479 --> 01:07:52,313
<i>Thinking of you?</i>

878
01:07:53,251 --> 01:07:59,588
<i>Oh, why does it do this</i>

879
01:07:59,757 --> 01:08:01,748
<i>To me?</i>

880
01:08:01,926 --> 01:08:05,828
<i>Is it such bliss</i>
<i>To be</i>

881
01:08:06,464 --> 01:08:09,797
<i>Thinking of you?</i>

882
01:08:11,469 --> 01:08:15,769
<i>And when I fall asleep at night</i>

883
01:08:15,940 --> 01:08:20,240
<i>It seems</i>

884
01:08:20,411 --> 01:08:23,005
<i>You just tiptoe</i>

885
01:08:23,181 --> 01:08:28,585
<i>Into all my dreams</i>

886
01:08:28,753 --> 01:08:33,053
<i>So I</i>

887
01:08:33,224 --> 01:08:38,287
<i>Think of no other one</i>

888
01:08:38,462 --> 01:08:43,297
<i>Ever since I've begun</i>

889
01:08:43,534 --> 01:08:49,962
<i>Thinking of you</i>

890
01:08:50,942 --> 01:08:53,342
Oh, Bert.

891
01:11:13,784 --> 01:11:17,242
- Nice tune, Harry.
- Oh, Harry, it's wonderful.

892
01:11:17,421 --> 01:11:18,945
Thanks.

893
01:11:39,610 --> 01:11:42,477
Thank you for the song, Bert.
It's beautiful.

894
01:11:42,646 --> 01:11:45,274
You know, Harry never wrote
a melody like that before.

895
01:11:45,449 --> 01:11:47,280
He must be in love or something.

896
01:11:47,451 --> 01:11:50,113
Why does he have to be in love?
Songwriting is a business.

897
01:11:50,287 --> 01:11:52,084
You could write a love song
in a subway train.

898
01:11:52,256 --> 01:11:55,350
Not a love song like that.
You have to feel it.

899
01:11:55,526 --> 01:11:57,323
Didn't you?

900
01:11:57,661 --> 01:12:00,027
Oh, I think of you once in a while.

901
01:12:00,331 --> 01:12:01,730
Thank you, darling.

902
01:12:01,899 --> 01:12:04,333
All the same,
I still think Harry's in love.

903
01:12:04,502 --> 01:12:07,062
Don't be silly. Just because
he writes a romantic tune...

904
01:12:07,238 --> 01:12:11,231
...that doesn't mean he has to be
Beethoven. Any good songwriter can...

905
01:12:12,076 --> 01:12:14,271
Don't look now,
but here comes Beethoven.

906
01:12:14,712 --> 01:12:17,203
And Capri was impossible.

907
01:12:17,381 --> 01:12:20,179
Actually impossible.

908
01:12:20,351 --> 01:12:23,878
Pepi, dear, be a good little sweetheart
and run along.

909
01:12:31,562 --> 01:12:33,325
Al Schacht.

910
01:12:34,031 --> 01:12:35,828
Go on home.

911
01:12:36,200 --> 01:12:38,031
Back to third.

912
01:12:38,202 --> 01:12:39,829
Go on home.

913
01:12:40,004 --> 01:12:41,995
Back to third.
Go on home.

914
01:12:42,173 --> 01:12:44,038
Back to third.

915
01:12:46,477 --> 01:12:48,104
Al.

916
01:12:49,747 --> 01:12:51,612
Get her up there, Al.

917
01:12:51,882 --> 01:12:53,213
Higher.

918
01:12:53,384 --> 01:12:54,976
Thank you.

919
01:12:55,152 --> 01:12:56,813
- What about you, Harry?
- Me?

920
01:12:56,987 --> 01:12:58,648
- Yeah.
- Give me the ball.

921
01:12:58,823 --> 01:13:01,087
All right. Lift her up.

922
01:13:02,660 --> 01:13:04,059
Higher.

923
01:13:04,228 --> 01:13:05,661
Higher!

924
01:13:05,830 --> 01:13:08,492
- Thank you!
- Oh, wait a minute.

925
01:13:16,874 --> 01:13:18,569
You all right?

926
01:13:19,343 --> 01:13:22,506
Yes. Okay.

927
01:13:45,703 --> 01:13:48,968
- Ball took a bad hop.
- A bad hop. A bad hop.

928
01:13:49,140 --> 01:13:51,734
We go to rehearsal in two weeks.
What do I tell Sam Harris?

929
01:13:51,909 --> 01:13:53,843
The ball took a bad hop?
He'll be delighted.

930
01:13:54,011 --> 01:13:57,242
You and your baseball. Every time
I turn around, you're playing baseball.

931
01:13:57,414 --> 01:14:01,214
- That's for kids. Kid stuff!
- Well, I suppose magic's for grownups.

932
01:14:01,385 --> 01:14:04,377
- What's magic got to do with it?
- Here, pick a card. Pick a card.

933
01:14:04,555 --> 01:14:07,490
Don't let me see which one you take.
Ace of clubs? Right? Correct.

934
01:14:07,658 --> 01:14:09,489
Hooray!

935
01:14:09,927 --> 01:14:12,862
It's not the same thing at all.
We have no regular partnership.

936
01:14:13,030 --> 01:14:16,761
- lf one of us breaks this up, it's okay.
- It's all right with me too.

937
01:14:16,934 --> 01:14:18,526
- Then that's understood!
- Okay!

938
01:14:18,702 --> 01:14:20,829
Okay, okay!

939
01:14:27,678 --> 01:14:29,669
Now, play this thing again.

940
01:14:32,116 --> 01:14:34,084
No, don't play it. Sing it.

941
01:14:34,251 --> 01:14:37,015
<i>Hooray for Captain Spalding</i>
<i>The African explorer</i>

942
01:14:37,188 --> 01:14:38,553
<i>Did someone call me schnorrer?</i>

943
01:14:38,722 --> 01:14:41,486
- <i>Hooray! Hooray! Hooray!</i>
- <i>Hooray! Hooray! Hooray!</i>

944
01:14:51,402 --> 01:14:53,563
How do you think it's going, Bert?

945
01:14:53,871 --> 01:14:55,202
Pretty good so far.

946
01:14:55,372 --> 01:14:58,500
- Walk around. See what they're saying.
- Okay.

947
01:15:11,055 --> 01:15:13,922
- Wonderful first act, Mr. Ruby.
- Thank you.

948
01:15:14,091 --> 01:15:16,423
Oh, hello. Hello there.

949
01:15:16,594 --> 01:15:18,459
You don't remember me, do you?

950
01:15:18,629 --> 01:15:21,063
Sure. You...

951
01:15:21,966 --> 01:15:24,935
- The understudy in <i>The Ramblers.</i>
- That's right.

952
01:15:25,102 --> 01:15:27,832
Last time we met,
you were on your way to Hollywood.

953
01:15:28,005 --> 01:15:29,597
How did you make out? All right?

954
01:15:29,773 --> 01:15:31,206
- Pretty well.
- All right. Good.

955
01:15:31,375 --> 01:15:34,902
Bert and I are thinking about going out...
Bert, you remember Miss...

956
01:15:35,079 --> 01:15:37,343
- How do you do?
- Yes. How are you, Mr. Kalmar?

957
01:15:37,514 --> 01:15:40,347
They're figuring on making a movie
out of <i>The Ramblers.</i>

958
01:15:40,517 --> 01:15:43,577
That's wonderful.
You must look me up.

959
01:15:43,754 --> 01:15:45,483
We sure will.

960
01:15:46,190 --> 01:15:48,124
- They're taking our picture.
- Yes.

961
01:15:48,292 --> 01:15:49,520
One more, please.

962
01:15:50,227 --> 01:15:51,455
Thank you.

963
01:15:51,629 --> 01:15:53,824
The show must be okay,
they're taking our picture.

964
01:15:53,998 --> 01:15:56,023
- Well, good night.
- Good night.

965
01:15:56,200 --> 01:15:57,827
- Good night.
- Good night.

966
01:15:58,002 --> 01:15:59,731
What do you mean,
taking our picture?

967
01:15:59,903 --> 01:16:02,701
- I don't suppose you know who that is.
- Don't you remember her?

968
01:16:02,873 --> 01:16:05,341
She was the understudy
in <i>The Ramblers.</i> Nice kid.

969
01:16:05,509 --> 01:16:08,205
- You ought to see more movies.
- Why?

970
01:16:08,379 --> 01:16:10,040
Come here, son.

971
01:16:12,549 --> 01:16:15,313
See that sign?
There's your understudy.

972
01:16:22,826 --> 01:16:24,919
She's a movie star?

973
01:16:25,562 --> 01:16:28,292
Oh, she must think I'm crazy.

974
01:16:28,465 --> 01:16:30,126
Wait a minute.

975
01:16:32,136 --> 01:16:34,400
Now, how could anyone
possibly think you're crazy?

976
01:16:34,571 --> 01:16:37,165
Oh, come on.

977
01:16:43,781 --> 01:16:45,976
<i>I love you so much</i>

978
01:16:47,017 --> 01:16:49,542

979
01:16:50,120 --> 01:16:52,418
<i>I love you so much</i>

980
01:16:52,589 --> 01:16:56,116
<i>It's a wonder you don't feel it</i>

981
01:16:56,694 --> 01:16:58,628
Yeah, it's all right. It's all right.

982
01:16:58,796 --> 01:17:01,697
- You got any other tunes?
- Let me see.

983
01:17:01,865 --> 01:17:03,765
I got something that'll fit.

984
01:17:03,934 --> 01:17:07,426
Of course, you have to take off one word
to make it "I love you so."

985
01:17:07,604 --> 01:17:09,128
Let's hear it.

986
01:17:10,274 --> 01:17:12,504
<i>I love you so</i>

987
01:17:12,676 --> 01:17:14,576
<i>I can't conceal it</i>

988
01:17:14,745 --> 01:17:18,909
<i>It's a wonder that you don't feel it</i>
<i>I love</i>...

989
01:17:19,083 --> 01:17:23,247
Harry, cut it out, will you? For the last time,
I'm telling you, lay off that tune.

990
01:17:23,420 --> 01:17:24,614
What's the matter with it?

991
01:17:24,788 --> 01:17:27,484
He's been trying to sell it to me
once a week since we met.

992
01:17:27,658 --> 01:17:30,525
I can't help it, Bert.
I can't think of a title.

993
01:17:30,694 --> 01:17:34,323
How can anybody ever think of a title
for that thing?

994
01:17:35,899 --> 01:17:38,459
- Oh, that's a nice title.
- What else can you say?

995
01:17:38,635 --> 01:17:40,500
- Play that other thing.
- You don't like it.

996
01:17:40,671 --> 01:17:42,901
I love it, I'm crazy about it.
Play it, will you?

997
01:17:43,073 --> 01:17:44,904
Who do you think's gonna
be in our picture?

998
01:17:45,075 --> 01:17:48,010
- Who?
- That understudy.

999
01:17:56,854 --> 01:18:00,153

- Thanks.

1036

Don't you ever get tired
of watching this?

1037
01:20:08,886 --> 01:20:10,353
Not the way you do it.

1038
01:20:10,521 --> 01:20:12,853
You should've been the star
in the Broadway version.

1039
01:20:13,023 --> 01:20:14,718
- Oh, I don't know.
- Yes.

1040
01:20:14,892 --> 01:20:17,486
- You really think so?
- Sure. She'd have been great.

1041
01:20:17,661 --> 01:20:19,652
Why don't you go out
and get a cup of coffee?

1042
01:20:19,830 --> 01:20:22,697
- Who wants coffee?
- Coffee's good for you sometimes.

1043
01:20:22,866 --> 01:20:24,891
My crazy friend Kendall The Great.

1044
01:20:25,068 --> 01:20:27,127
I mean it. How did we happen
to pass you by?

1045
01:20:28,005 --> 01:20:30,701
- Well, it's a long story.
- I'm interested.

1046
01:20:30,874 --> 01:20:32,341
He's interested.

1047
01:20:32,509 --> 01:20:36,946
Well, I tried out for the part.
It was practically all set.

1048
01:20:37,114 --> 01:20:40,447
And a fellow brought in another girl.
A very pretty girl.

1049
01:20:40,884 --> 01:20:42,852
- He was a songwriter.
- Named Snooky?

1050
01:20:43,020 --> 01:20:44,612
- That's right.
- Snooky?

1051
01:20:44,788 --> 01:20:47,256
Whoever heard
of a songwriter named...

1052
01:20:47,925 --> 01:20:49,187
Snoo... Me?

1053
01:20:50,060 --> 01:20:53,427
Oh, you mean that girl l...

1054
01:20:54,865 --> 01:20:57,891
You're a magician.
Make me disappear.

1055

<i>I can't forget</i>
<i>The night we met</i>

1056
01:21:04,741 --> 01:21:06,766
- It looks lovely, Lennie.
- Thank you.

1057
01:21:06,944 --> 01:21:09,208
I'll let you know when to light it
and bring it in.

<i>The moon lit up the sky</i>

01:21:16,320 --> 01:21:19,881
<i>I kissed you once</i>
<i>I kissed you twice</i>

1061
01:21:20,057 --> 01:21:23,151

1062
01:21:23,493 --> 01:21:29,989
<i>That night upon</i>
<i>The shores of Araby</i>

1063
01:21:32,002 --> 01:21:35,961
- All right, so I wrote a lyric once.
- Oh, no, you didn't.

1064
01:21:36,406 --> 01:21:39,273
"My Sunny Tennessee"
was a great song.

1065
01:21:39,443 --> 01:21:43,174
This is a very happy,
happy anniversary.

1066
01:21:43,447 --> 01:21:44,880
Happy days.

1067
01:21:45,048 --> 01:21:49,144
- Get our boy here.
- I'm celebrating with my friends.

1068
01:21:49,319 --> 01:21:53,312
You know, this is the third time
in my life I've had more than one drink.

1069
01:21:53,890 --> 01:21:57,792
- Very interesting.
- Yes, it is. Come here, Charlie.

1070
01:21:59,363 --> 01:22:00,830
Very interesting.

1071
01:22:01,498 --> 01:22:04,558
- I didn't say anything wrong.
- No, you said nothing at all.

1072
01:22:04,735 --> 01:22:07,795
Well, it's a great privilege
to be with you boys tonight.

1073
01:22:07,971 --> 01:22:09,302
And I mean that.

1074
01:22:09,473 --> 01:22:12,931
- And I can say it in this room.
- It's a nice room.

1075
01:22:13,510 --> 01:22:16,741
You fellows have written
lots of songs together.

1076
01:22:16,913 --> 01:22:19,973
But more than that,
you've been friends.

1077
01:22:20,150 --> 01:22:22,778
That's the most important thing
in the world, are friends.

1078
01:22:22,953 --> 01:22:25,945
- Shall I put some bicarbonate in this?
- It wouldn't hurt.

1079
01:22:26,123 --> 01:22:29,581
You know, you've got a friend,
and you've got a friend.

1080
01:22:29,760 --> 01:22:32,991
And that's what I'd like to see.
Friends.

1081
01:22:33,764 --> 01:22:35,994
Very funny.
We'll spot it in our next picture.

1082
01:22:36,166 --> 01:22:40,034
- Here.
- Hey, look at that, huh?

1083
01:22:40,671 --> 01:22:43,265
Here, drink this.

1084
01:22:43,740 --> 01:22:45,765
Hey, I was just thinking.

1085
01:22:45,942 --> 01:22:48,911
The time Harry called Tony Miller.

1086
01:22:49,079 --> 01:22:52,310
You said, "Mr. Miller,
if you back that play...

1087
01:22:52,482 --> 01:22:55,940
...you're gonna be the brokest broker
that ever stepped on Broadway."

1088
01:22:56,119 --> 01:22:57,950
- Remember?
- Yeah.

1089
01:23:01,491 --> 01:23:03,686
What play was that?

1090
01:23:04,695 --> 01:23:07,289
Your play. You wrote it.

1091
01:23:07,464 --> 01:23:09,591
And your friend got you out of it.

1092
01:23:09,766 --> 01:23:12,735
And we went up to see him.
And when we told you...

1093
01:23:12,903 --> 01:23:16,066
...I will never forget
the expression on your face...

1094
01:23:16,239 --> 01:23:19,231
...as long as I live.
Believe me, I'll never forget it.

1095
01:23:21,912 --> 01:23:25,245
Oh, hey, Bert,
that was a long time ago.

1096
01:23:27,517 --> 01:23:30,509
I think I better get some coffee.

1097
01:23:35,158 --> 01:23:37,217
Charlie's got the talkers.

1098
01:23:37,661 --> 01:23:38,889
Just kidding, huh?

1099
01:23:39,062 --> 01:23:41,223
No, I always meant
to tell you about it, Bert...

1100
01:23:41,398 --> 01:23:43,889
...but I just never got around to it.

1101
01:23:46,369 --> 01:23:48,667
I can understand that.

1102
01:23:52,342 --> 01:23:55,277
What was on your mind, Harry,
when you crabbed that deal for me?

1103
01:23:55,445 --> 01:23:57,640
- What do you think?
- I'm asking.

1104
01:23:57,814 --> 01:24:01,443
Well, I didn't want you to flop.
That play wasn't too good, Bert.

1105
01:24:01,618 --> 01:24:03,347
You decided that.

1106
01:24:03,520 --> 01:24:05,112
Oh, why not? You're an expert.

1107
01:24:05,288 --> 01:24:08,951
Now, wait a minute. You're not gonna
pull a peeve after all these years.

1108
01:24:09,126 --> 01:24:12,391
- What do you expect me to do?
- All right, I was wrong.

1109
01:24:12,562 --> 01:24:14,928
I just didn't want you to get hurt.

1110
01:24:15,098 --> 01:24:16,963
That's very touching.

1111
01:24:17,601 --> 01:24:19,796
Well, why else would I do it?

1112
01:24:19,970 --> 01:24:23,064
Whatever the reason,
you had a sweet nerve.

1113
01:24:23,907 --> 01:24:25,898
What do you mean,
"whatever the reason"?

1114
01:24:26,243 --> 01:24:28,734
All I know is I wanted something
very much.

1115
01:24:28,912 --> 01:24:31,312
And now I find out
my partner did me out of it.

1116
01:24:31,481 --> 01:24:34,416
Well, I told you why, I was worried.

1117
01:24:34,584 --> 01:24:36,882
About me or yourself?

1118
01:24:38,455 --> 01:24:41,720
Oh, sure. Now I get it.

1119
01:24:41,992 --> 01:24:44,256
You think I didn't want you
to have that play.

1120
01:24:44,427 --> 01:24:47,760
I was scared the play might click
and bust up our partnership...

1121
01:24:47,931 --> 01:24:49,762
...and I couldn't lean on you anymore.

1122
01:24:50,300 --> 01:24:51,597
Is that what you meant?

1123
01:24:51,768 --> 01:24:54,896
If I believed that,
I couldn't be any sorer than I am now.

1124
01:24:55,071 --> 01:24:57,335
But you do believe it.

1125
01:24:58,508 --> 01:25:00,840
You must think I needed you
pretty badly.

1126
01:25:01,778 --> 01:25:03,939
You must have thought so.

1127
01:25:04,347 --> 01:25:05,780
Not that badly.

1128
01:25:06,550 --> 01:25:08,643
Look, I'm not forgetting anything.

1129
01:25:08,819 --> 01:25:11,344
I know what I was
when I ran into you:

1130
01:25:11,521 --> 01:25:13,648
A song-plugger.

1131
01:25:13,824 --> 01:25:16,691
But even without you,
I might have gotten somewhere.

1132
01:25:16,860 --> 01:25:19,090
It's just possible.

1133
01:25:19,429 --> 01:25:20,760
All by myself.

1134
01:25:21,565 --> 01:25:24,033
It's not too late to try.

1135
01:25:28,238 --> 01:25:31,799
Harry. Bert. Come on,
it's time to cut the cake.

1136
01:25:31,975 --> 01:25:35,638
Come on. Everybody's waiting.

1137
01:25:43,320 --> 01:25:44,981
Harry. Bert.

1138
01:25:45,155 --> 01:25:46,383
- Come on.
- Make a wish.

1139
01:25:46,556 --> 01:25:48,956
- Make a wish.
- Make a wish, come on.

1140
01:25:54,497 --> 01:25:57,432
Hello, hello. Bert? Marty.

1141
01:25:57,601 --> 01:26:00,593
Say, some of the boys down here
got ahold of a screwy item...

1142
01:26:00,770 --> 01:26:02,601
...for tomorrow's issue. Listen:

1143
01:26:02,772 --> 01:26:04,637
"Kalmar and Ruby split.

1144
01:26:04,808 --> 01:26:09,404
Songwriting team are calling it quits
after a long and successful partnership.

1145
01:26:09,579 --> 01:26:14,573
Understood Kalmar will devote his time
to stories and screenplay writing."

1146
01:26:14,751 --> 01:26:17,481
Say, will you tell the boys
they're crazy?

1147
01:26:20,624 --> 01:26:22,615
Okay, Bert.

1148
01:26:22,792 --> 01:26:24,384
Sorry.

1149
01:26:26,263 --> 01:26:27,696
Print it.

1150
01:26:34,204 --> 01:26:36,172
Nice tune.

1151
01:26:36,339 --> 01:26:39,274
- Have you got any lyrics for it?
- No.

1152
01:26:39,442 --> 01:26:40,841
No words.

1153
01:26:43,480 --> 01:26:45,641
Ever hear from Bert?

1154
01:26:47,417 --> 01:26:49,715
No. He's writing those scripts.

1155
01:26:49,886 --> 01:26:51,945
Doing real well, they tell me.

1156
01:26:52,122 --> 01:26:54,613
You know,
Bert's really a smart fella.

1157
01:26:57,894 --> 01:27:00,124
Oh, that's nice too.

1158
01:27:29,793 --> 01:27:33,285
That's one of the nicest
melodies you've ever written, Harry.

1159
01:27:33,730 --> 01:27:36,028
It's always been my favorite.

1160
01:27:44,841 --> 01:27:47,969
<i>It seems</i>

1161
01:27:49,112 --> 01:27:51,273
<i>You just tiptoe</i>

1162
01:27:51,448 --> 01:27:56,715
<i>Into all my dreams</i>

1163
01:27:57,854 --> 01:28:01,051
<i>So I</i>

1164
01:28:01,224 --> 01:28:06,025
<i>Think of no other one</i>

1165
01:28:06,196 --> 01:28:11,133
<i>Ever since I've begun</i>

1166
01:28:11,301 --> 01:28:17,604
<i>Thinking of you</i>

1167
01:28:19,342 --> 01:28:21,401
It's different from the rest.

1168
01:28:23,079 --> 01:28:26,640
You must've been very much in love
when you wrote this one.

1169
01:28:27,884 --> 01:28:29,511
Well...

1170
01:28:31,121 --> 01:28:32,645
You wanna know something?

1171
01:28:32,822 --> 01:28:35,256
I think I wrote it too soon.

1172
01:28:44,734 --> 01:28:47,430
- Morning.
- Morning, Jess.

1173
01:28:47,604 --> 01:28:50,300
- Been working all night?
- Most of it.

1174
01:28:50,473 --> 01:28:52,373
There's a review
of your picture in here.

1175
01:28:52,542 --> 01:28:55,909
- Oh, what did they say?
- You're a big man this morning.

1176
01:28:56,079 --> 01:28:59,207
"The story by Bert Kalmar
is thoroughly enjoyable.

1177
01:28:59,382 --> 01:29:02,215
The dialogue neat and deftly turned."

1178
01:29:02,385 --> 01:29:06,048
- How's that?
- Let me see it. I love good notices.

1179
01:29:07,157 --> 01:29:08,556
Hey, did you see this?

1180
01:29:17,267 --> 01:29:19,758
They flew to Yuma last night.

1181
01:29:21,137 --> 01:29:23,105
She's a very nice girl, Bert.

1182
01:29:25,141 --> 01:29:26,665
Yeah.

1183
01:29:30,647 --> 01:29:35,209
Well, we didn't have to wire
Al Schacht this time, did we?

1184
01:29:41,558 --> 01:29:43,856
You didn't eat a thing.

1185
01:29:44,094 --> 01:29:45,561
I wasn't hungry.

1186
01:29:45,728 --> 01:29:49,027
- Just tired, huh?
- Oh, a little bit.

1187
01:30:15,391 --> 01:30:21,057
<i>You are my lucky star</i>

1188
01:30:21,598 --> 01:30:27,161
<i>I saw you from afar</i>

1189
01:30:27,337 --> 01:30:28,702
And so, ladies and gentlemen...

1190
01:30:28,872 --> 01:30:31,841
...we bring to a close another issue
of <i>The Songwriters' Parade.</i>

1191
01:30:32,008 --> 01:30:35,705
<i>Tonight's honored guests were</i>
<i>Arthur Freed and Nacio Herb Brown.</i>

1192
01:30:35,879 --> 01:30:39,212
<i>We'll be back again next week</i>
<i>to pay tribute once again...</i>

1193
01:30:39,382 --> 01:30:41,373
<i>... to the men</i>
<i>who write America's songs.</i>

1194
01:30:41,551 --> 01:30:44,645
<i>At that time we'll be happy to present</i>
<i>as our guests...</i>

1195
01:30:44,821 --> 01:30:48,348
<i>... Bert Kalmar and Harry Ruby.</i>

1196
01:30:51,227 --> 01:30:53,491
Is that Phil Regan out of his mind
or something?

1197
01:30:53,663 --> 01:30:55,563
I don't know.

1198
01:30:56,466 --> 01:30:58,593
Whoever told him
to announce a thing like that?

1199
01:30:58,768 --> 01:31:00,167
A personal appearance.

1200
01:31:00,336 --> 01:31:03,100
- There's nothing so terrible about it.
- Nothing so terrible?

1201
01:31:03,273 --> 01:31:05,867
A radio show with two people
who don't talk to each other?

1202
01:31:06,042 --> 01:31:09,500
- I wanna get that Regan on the phone.
- No. You can't do that.

1203
01:31:09,679 --> 01:31:11,840
- Why not?
- Because...

1204
01:31:12,015 --> 01:31:14,609
If Phil Regan was nice enough
to think of you...

1205
01:31:14,784 --> 01:31:16,877
...the least you can do is to be there.

1206
01:31:17,053 --> 01:31:18,918
I'll take that.

1207
01:31:19,088 --> 01:31:20,282
He ought to know better...

1208
01:31:20,456 --> 01:31:23,152
...than to announce a thing like that
without checking first.

1209
01:31:23,326 --> 01:31:25,726
What kind of a business is this?

1210
01:31:25,895 --> 01:31:27,658
- Kalmar and Ruby, he said.
- Hello?

1211
01:31:27,830 --> 01:31:29,661
- Kalmar and Ruby.
- Oh, hello, Eileen.

1212
01:31:29,832 --> 01:31:31,390
Like we were brothers or something.

1213
01:31:31,568 --> 01:31:34,765
- Well, I don't know.
- That doesn't mean I have to go.

1214
01:31:34,938 --> 01:31:37,566
- He ought to stop thinking...
- How's it going at your house?

1215
01:31:38,007 --> 01:31:40,475
- Well, hold on.
- This will be a great show. Great.

1216
01:31:40,643 --> 01:31:43,737
How can they do a thing like this?
I didn't okay it.

1217
01:31:43,913 --> 01:31:46,643
Tell him to get another voice
because I'm not gonna be there.

1218
01:31:46,816 --> 01:31:49,478
Bert won't be there either.
What do they expect me to do...

1219
01:31:49,652 --> 01:31:52,314
...play the piano while Bert makes
a microphone disappear?

1220
01:31:52,522 --> 01:31:54,353
It's a little early to tell yet, Jessie.

1221
01:31:54,691 --> 01:31:57,421
I know what you mean.
Keep your fingers crossed.

1222
01:31:57,594 --> 01:32:00,028
Who told them to do it?
Who put them up to it?

1223
01:32:00,196 --> 01:32:04,132
- lf they ever find out that we did this...
- What kind of routine are we supposed to do?

1224
01:32:04,300 --> 01:32:05,892
An argument for the benefit
of our audience?

1225
01:32:06,069 --> 01:32:07,798
Look, Eileen, I'll call you back later.

1226
01:32:07,971 --> 01:32:10,633
We're on the air, boys, shake hands.
Come out fighting.

1227
01:32:11,207 --> 01:32:13,505
Oh, come on, Harry.

1228
01:32:13,676 --> 01:32:16,839
Ah, this whole thing's silly.
I don't like it, Eileen.

1229
01:32:17,013 --> 01:32:19,641
Oh, I know.
In a way it is embarrassing.

1230
01:32:19,816 --> 01:32:22,250
But after all, Regan
was nice enough to think of you.

1231
01:32:22,418 --> 01:32:24,909
The very least you can do
is be there.

1232
01:32:26,789 --> 01:32:29,986
- Eileen, Harry!
- Jessie, how are you?

1233
01:32:30,159 --> 01:32:33,959
How are you, Eileen?
You look wonderful. I'll take your hat.

1234
01:32:35,298 --> 01:32:38,324
- Hello, Bert.
- Hello, Eileen.

1235
01:32:38,501 --> 01:32:40,833
- Hi.
- Hi.

1236
01:32:48,544 --> 01:32:51,308
- Pull up a stool.
- Oh, thanks.

1237
01:32:54,284 --> 01:32:56,445
Well, it looks like
we're stuck with this thing.

1238
01:32:56,619 --> 01:32:58,382
I guess so.

1239
01:32:58,855 --> 01:33:01,380
Got any ideas what we might do?

1240
01:33:04,060 --> 01:33:06,119
I found one of the old routines.

1241
01:33:06,296 --> 01:33:08,196
It might be okay.

1242
01:33:08,364 --> 01:33:10,298
That thing we did
at the Friars, remember?

1243
01:33:10,466 --> 01:33:11,899
Sure.

1244
01:33:12,402 --> 01:33:15,200
Oh, sure. Sure. This is okay.

1245
01:33:15,738 --> 01:33:17,433
Want to rehearse?

1246
01:33:17,974 --> 01:33:20,966
Oh, I know the music.
You know the words?

1247
01:33:21,144 --> 01:33:22,839
Yeah, I know the words.

1248
01:33:23,713 --> 01:33:25,613
Well, I guess
we don't have to rehearse.

1249
01:33:27,083 --> 01:33:28,675
I guess not.

1250
01:33:52,175 --> 01:33:53,836
Well, I'll see you tomorrow night,
I guess.

1251
01:33:54,010 --> 01:33:55,238
I guess so.

1252
01:33:55,411 --> 01:33:57,242
Oh, say...

1253
01:33:57,747 --> 01:34:01,183
I caught your picture the other night.
Nice job.

1254
01:34:01,351 --> 01:34:02,841
It's all right, I guess.

1255
01:34:03,019 --> 01:34:05,214
I hear you've been knocking out
good tunes lately.

1256
01:34:05,388 --> 01:34:07,413
Oh, I've been kicking it
around a little.

1257
01:34:07,590 --> 01:34:10,320
You got anything?

1258
01:34:10,493 --> 01:34:14,429
Sure. Sure, I've got one little tune
I've been working on.

1259
01:34:15,131 --> 01:34:16,530
Of course, you won't like it.

1260
01:34:16,699 --> 01:34:18,997
- What won't I like?
- What I got.

1261
01:34:19,168 --> 01:34:22,865
- I haven't heard it yet.
- Okay.

1262
01:34:26,008 --> 01:34:28,909
- Sounds vaguely familiar.
- Well, I told you you wouldn't like it.

1263
01:34:29,078 --> 01:34:32,377
I never said that. It's a nice tune,
a very nice tune.

1264
01:34:32,548 --> 01:34:34,675
You never got a title for it, huh?

1265
01:34:34,851 --> 01:34:37,012
No, in fact, never did.

1266
01:34:37,186 --> 01:34:41,623
There was "La-Da-Dee-Da"
and "Beep-Beep-A-Deep."

1267
01:34:41,791 --> 01:34:43,452
That's about all we got.

1268
01:34:43,626 --> 01:34:46,720
Let's see. We ought to get something
for a tune like that.

1269
01:34:46,896 --> 01:34:49,160
Play that first part, will you?

1270
01:34:52,101 --> 01:34:53,728
<i>Oh me, oh my</i>

1271
01:34:53,903 --> 01:34:55,734
No. That's no good.

1272
01:34:55,905 --> 01:34:57,463
You know, that's not a bad tune.

1273
01:34:57,640 --> 01:35:01,337
- I could've been wrong about it.
- Well, you usually weren't.

1274
01:35:02,779 --> 01:35:04,007
Well, let me see.

1275
01:35:05,982 --> 01:35:07,813
<i>I love you so</i>

1276
01:35:07,984 --> 01:35:09,849
No, that's that thing we had before.

1277
01:35:10,019 --> 01:35:11,748
We'll get it. We'll get something.

1278
01:35:11,921 --> 01:35:13,786
Yeah, we'll get it.

1279
01:35:13,956 --> 01:35:15,583
Do you want to work on it?

1280
01:35:15,758 --> 01:35:18,090
We could knock it off this afternoon.

1281
01:35:18,561 --> 01:35:20,392
- Okay. Let's knock it off.
- All right.

1282
01:35:20,563 --> 01:35:24,329
I can't this afternoon. I just remembered
there's a double-header at Wrigley Field.

1283
01:35:24,500 --> 01:35:26,968
It's not that I wanna go.
You see, I promised a fella...

1284
01:35:27,136 --> 01:35:31,072
- I see. Baseball is more important.
- No. No, I'll work with you tonight.

1285
01:35:31,240 --> 01:35:32,605
All night if you want to.

1286
01:35:32,775 --> 01:35:34,242
All right, if you want to.

1287
01:35:34,410 --> 01:35:36,002
No, wait a minute, I can't.

1288
01:35:36,179 --> 01:35:38,613
I've got a meeting tonight.
The magician's club.

1289
01:35:38,781 --> 01:35:40,578
The magician's club?

1290
01:35:40,750 --> 01:35:42,513
- Yeah.
- You've gotta do tricks, huh?

1291
01:35:42,685 --> 01:35:45,916
- No, I don't gotta do tricks.
- Yeah, you gotta make rabbits disappear.

1292
01:35:46,088 --> 01:35:48,852
No, I don't have to make rabbits
disappear. I'm the president.

1293
01:35:49,025 --> 01:35:51,789
- Well, hooray!
- Yeah, hooray.

1294
01:35:51,961 --> 01:35:54,361
You should talk.
The nation's number one baseball fan.

1295
01:35:54,530 --> 01:35:57,226
- "Take him out. Take him out."
- Now it's my fault.

1296
01:35:57,400 --> 01:35:59,561
- I was willing to work.
- You don't want to work.

1297
01:35:59,735 --> 01:36:01,862
- You never wanted to work.
- What do you mean?

1298
01:36:02,038 --> 01:36:04,472
Every time I wanna do something,
you're catching flies.

1299
01:36:04,640 --> 01:36:06,540
- Don't talk about me.
- I'll talk about you.

1300
01:36:06,709 --> 01:36:08,540
What about you,
that sleight-of-hand stuff?

1301
01:36:08,711 --> 01:36:12,306
That dangling ropes in the air,
pulling cigars out of your ears?

1302
01:36:12,482 --> 01:36:14,916
- Yeah?
- That's important for kids.

1303
01:36:15,084 --> 01:36:17,348
- For kids?
- Yeah, for kids!

1304
01:36:17,787 --> 01:36:19,084
I better get him out of here.

1305
01:36:19,288 --> 01:36:21,552
This is what I've been waiting for.
Come, sit down.

1306
01:36:21,724 --> 01:36:23,419
Keep your voice down.

1307
01:36:23,593 --> 01:36:25,720
I didn't wanna work, he says.
What about you?

1308
01:36:25,895 --> 01:36:28,056
I wouldn't write that song
if you begged me.

1309
01:36:28,231 --> 01:36:31,723
- Begged you? I didn't even ask you.
- I guess you just can't help it, Harry.

1310
01:36:31,901 --> 01:36:33,129
I feel sorry for you.

1311
01:36:33,302 --> 01:36:35,497
You feel sorry for me?
You must think I'm just...

1312
01:36:35,671 --> 01:36:38,196
I can tell you what I think of you
in three little words:

1313
01:36:38,374 --> 01:36:40,342
You're a dope!

1314
01:36:51,053 --> 01:36:53,021
"You're a dope."

1315
01:36:53,756 --> 01:36:57,783
Bert called me
three little words, "You're a dope."

1316
01:37:00,763 --> 01:37:03,527
<i>You are a dope</i>

1317
01:37:05,401 --> 01:37:08,598
<i>Three little words</i>

1318
01:37:10,940 --> 01:37:13,602
<i>Three little words</i>

1319
01:37:16,145 --> 01:37:18,739
It fits. Hey, Bert! Bert!

1320
01:37:20,816 --> 01:37:22,647
This is my house.
Why should I walk out?

1321
01:37:22,818 --> 01:37:24,945
- You got it, Bert, the title of the song.
- What?

1322
01:37:25,121 --> 01:37:26,645
"Three Little Words." You got it.

1323
01:37:26,822 --> 01:37:29,450
You better hurry.
You might miss the baseball game.

1324
01:37:35,131 --> 01:37:38,328
Oh, anytime you're ready to go,
Eileen. I'm ready.

1325
01:37:41,971 --> 01:37:43,495
- Bye, Jessie.
- Bye, Harry.

1326
01:37:43,673 --> 01:37:45,504
- Bye, Eileen.
- Bye, Jessie.

1327
01:37:47,410 --> 01:37:51,312
Good evening. We're here tonight to pay
tribute to two great pals of mine.

1328
01:37:51,480 --> 01:37:53,812
I know they've turned out many,
many hits together.

1329
01:37:53,983 --> 01:37:56,884
I'm sure you've whistled their tunes
and danced to their tunes...

1330
01:37:57,053 --> 01:38:00,614
...but I know you're gonna get a big kick
out of meeting them in person tonight.

1331
01:38:00,790 --> 01:38:03,657
None other than Bert Kalmar and...

1332
01:38:08,998 --> 01:38:10,966
And Harry Ruby.

1333
01:38:15,571 --> 01:38:18,005
- Hello, Harry. Bert, how are you?
- How are you, Phil?

1334
01:38:18,174 --> 01:38:22,201
Here they are, ladies and gentlemen,
going to sing a medley of their hit tunes.

1335
01:38:24,547 --> 01:38:27,539
<i>I wanna be in Tennessee</i>

1336
01:38:27,717 --> 01:38:30,345
<i>In my Dixie paradise</i>

1337
01:38:30,519 --> 01:38:33,454
<i>An angel's voice I hear</i>

1338
01:38:33,623 --> 01:38:36,717
<i>I mean my mammy dear</i>

1339
01:38:36,892 --> 01:38:38,723
And then we wrote...

1340
01:38:39,829 --> 01:38:42,696
- <i>Who's sorry now?</i>
- <i>Who's sorry now?</i>

1341
01:38:42,865 --> 01:38:45,459
- <i>Who's sorry now?</i>
- <i>Who's sorry?</i>

1342
01:38:45,635 --> 01:38:50,163
- <i>I tried to warn you somehow</i>
- <i>I tried to warn you somehow</i>

1343
01:38:50,339 --> 01:38:51,601
And then came...

1344
01:38:51,774 --> 01:38:57,474
<i>I wanna be loved by you</i>
<i>Just you and nobody else but you</i>

1345
01:38:57,647 --> 01:39:02,516
<i>I wanna be loved by you alone</i>

1346
01:39:05,021 --> 01:39:07,285
And then we sat down and wrote...

1347
01:39:08,391 --> 01:39:13,761
<i>Why is it I spend the day</i>

1348
01:39:13,929 --> 01:39:19,765
<i>Wake up and end the day</i>
<i>Thinking of you?</i>

1349
01:39:19,935 --> 01:39:22,369
And then we stood up and wrote...

1350
01:39:22,538 --> 01:39:27,441
<i>So long, Oo-long</i>
<i>How long you going to roam?</i>

1351
01:39:27,610 --> 01:39:30,977
<i>Please don't be too long</i>
<i>Oo-long, so long</i>

1352
01:39:31,147 --> 01:39:33,843
<i>Hurry back home</i>

1353
01:39:35,518 --> 01:39:39,113
<i>Maybe I'm right</i>
<i>And maybe I'm wrong</i>

1354
01:39:39,288 --> 01:39:42,951
<i>And maybe I'm weak</i>
<i>And maybe I'm strong</i>

1355
01:39:43,125 --> 01:39:46,424
<i>But nevertheless</i>
<i>I'm in love with you</i>

1356
01:39:49,765 --> 01:39:53,166
<i>Maybe I'll win</i>
<i>And maybe I'll</i>...

1357
01:39:53,335 --> 01:39:55,599
Oh, that's enough of that.

1358
01:39:55,771 --> 01:39:57,796
How would you like
to hear a brand-new song?

1359
01:40:02,078 --> 01:40:03,568
One we just wrote yesterday.

1360
01:40:03,746 --> 01:40:05,008
Well, not exactly yesterday.

1361
01:40:05,181 --> 01:40:07,809
As a matter of fact,
it took us about 10 years.

1362
01:40:07,983 --> 01:40:10,281
Phil, if you please?

1363
01:40:13,422 --> 01:40:16,050
<i>Three little words</i>

1364
01:40:16,225 --> 01:40:21,356
<i>Oh, what I'd give for</i>
<i>That wonderful phrase</i>

1365
01:40:21,530 --> 01:40:25,990
<i>To hear those</i>
<i>Three little words</i>

1366
01:40:26,168 --> 01:40:31,128
<i>That's all I'd live for</i>
<i>The rest of my days</i>

1367
01:40:31,507 --> 01:40:34,806
<i>And what I feel in my heart</i>

1368
01:40:34,977 --> 01:40:38,606
<i>They tell sincerely</i>

1369
01:40:38,781 --> 01:40:43,650
<i>No other words</i>
<i>Can tell it half so clearly</i>

1370
01:40:43,819 --> 01:40:48,119
<i>Three little words</i>
<i>Eight little letters</i>

1371
01:40:48,290 --> 01:40:53,887
<i>Which simply mean</i>
<i>I love you</i>

1372
01:40:54,396 --> 01:40:58,355
Wonderful, Bert, wonderful.
Thank you, Harry. Wonderful. Very good.

1373
01:40:58,534 --> 01:41:02,265
And now, we'll leave you
with three little words: let's all dance.

1374
01:41:03,572 --> 01:41:06,302
<i>Three little words</i>

1375
01:41:06,475 --> 01:41:11,970
<i>Oh, what I'd give for</i>
<i>That wonderful phrase</i>

1376
01:41:12,148 --> 01:41:16,346
<i>To hear those</i>
<i>Three little words</i>

1377
01:41:16,519 --> 01:41:19,010
- Sorry.
- Darling.

1378
01:41:19,188 --> 01:41:22,248
- It was just wonderful.
- Bert, it was wonderful.

1379
01:41:22,424 --> 01:41:25,291
Harry, I always knew
that was a great tune.

1380
01:41:29,999 --> 01:41:33,696
<i>No other words</i>
<i>Can tell it half so clearly</i>

1381
01:41:35,271 --> 01:41:40,800
<i>Three little words</i>
<i>Eight little letters</i>

1382
01:41:40,976 --> 01:41:47,848
<i>Which simply mean</i>
<i>I love you</i>

1383
01:42:16,579 --> 01:42:18,570
