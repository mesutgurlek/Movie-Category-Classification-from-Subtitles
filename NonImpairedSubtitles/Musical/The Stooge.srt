1
00:01:25,198 --> 00:01:28,224
Lackawanna 8-799.

2
00:01:36,443 --> 00:01:38,377
<i>Hello. Hello. </i>

3
00:01:38,545 --> 00:01:42,879
<i>I'm so afraid to close my eyes</i>

4
00:01:43,049 --> 00:01:44,346
<i>Afraid that I'll find</i>

5
00:01:47,053 --> 00:01:49,613
- That was mighty pretty, honey.
- <i>Oh, hello. </i>

6
00:01:50,323 --> 00:01:53,952
Say, are you doing anything
tomorrow after the matinee?

7
00:01:54,127 --> 00:01:56,618
- <i>No. </i>
- How would you like to get married?

8
00:01:56,797 --> 00:02:00,198
- Well, you got someone in mind?
- <i>Yes. Me. </i>

9
00:02:00,367 --> 00:02:03,700
Well, best offer I had today.
Suppose I think it over?

10
00:02:03,870 --> 00:02:06,134
All right, you take your time.
I'll hold on.

11
00:02:06,306 --> 00:02:08,035
OK.

12
00:02:08,208 --> 00:02:14,511
<i>This lovely thrill is just a silly illusion</i>

13
00:02:15,449 --> 00:02:20,079
<i>With my eyes wide open</i>

14
00:02:23,990 --> 00:02:27,858
<i>Do I deserve such a break? </i>

15
00:02:34,034 --> 00:02:35,501
You know, I think I can make it.

16
00:02:35,669 --> 00:02:39,469
Good. Oh, by the way,
what was that name again?

17
00:02:39,639 --> 00:02:42,233
- <i>Miller. Bill Miller. </i>
- Oh, how nice.

18
00:02:42,409 --> 00:02:44,741
- Well, good night, Mr. Miller.
- <i>Now, one minute. </i>

19
00:02:45,345 --> 00:02:48,246
- Who are you?
- Well, I'm Mary Turner.

20
00:02:49,082 --> 00:02:51,915
Good night, darling.
See you in church.

21
00:02:52,085 --> 00:02:54,076
<i>See you in church. </i>

22
00:03:07,267 --> 00:03:09,497
Mighty pretty. Mighty pretty.

23
00:03:09,669 --> 00:03:11,694
Thank you, sir.

24
00:03:13,106 --> 00:03:15,506
The agent's slice, Leo.
The usual ten percent.

25
00:03:15,675 --> 00:03:18,439
Looks like a small cut to me.

26
00:03:18,612 --> 00:03:20,671
- Hello, Mary.
- Hi, honey.

27
00:03:20,981 --> 00:03:25,042
And to you and Mary, the best of luck,
forever and a day.

28
00:03:25,218 --> 00:03:27,686
- I'll miss you, Bill.
- I'm gonna miss you too, Ben.

29
00:03:27,854 --> 00:03:29,344
You've been swell.
We had great years.

30
00:03:29,523 --> 00:03:32,458
Why the gloom, boys?
This is a wedding, not a wake.

31
00:03:32,626 --> 00:03:35,993
For the act, it's a wake. Bill's leaving.

32
00:03:36,630 --> 00:03:39,326
Well, I want to play the big time
on my own, as a single.

33
00:03:39,499 --> 00:03:41,126
Oh, is that so?

34
00:03:41,301 --> 00:03:44,793
I tell you, you're out of your head,
quitting a great comic like Ben Bailey.

35
00:03:44,971 --> 00:03:46,666
I did a single before.

36
00:03:46,840 --> 00:03:48,501
I know a lot more now.
I've learned from Ben.

37
00:03:48,675 --> 00:03:49,972
Listen, Bill,

38
00:03:50,143 --> 00:03:53,135
when I found you in Scranton,
you were making a fast 60.

39
00:03:53,313 --> 00:03:56,043
You had those flashy two-pants
suits and ragged underwear.

40
00:03:56,216 --> 00:03:58,116
Who got you to play
that chest piano?

41
00:03:58,285 --> 00:04:00,651
Who built you up to 1250?

42
00:04:00,820 --> 00:04:02,947
Who bought you your first tuxedo?

43
00:04:03,123 --> 00:04:05,057
- I did!
- Bill,

44
00:04:05,225 --> 00:04:07,386
the trick in show business
is to be a hit.

45
00:04:07,561 --> 00:04:11,053
With another guy, with a girl,
with a kangaroo, anything.

46
00:04:11,231 --> 00:04:13,995
Look, you're my friend,
but I don't think you can make it alone.

47
00:04:14,167 --> 00:04:17,159
Now, don't try to talk me out of it, boys.
I'm gonna start again in Scranton.

48
00:04:17,337 --> 00:04:21,239
Alone. If I have anything,
I'll be back here again, alone.

49
00:04:21,408 --> 00:04:23,308
My name will be on top, alone.

50
00:04:23,476 --> 00:04:25,808
Maybe you should have
got married, alone.

51
00:04:25,979 --> 00:04:29,176
I don't think you can stand two
talented people in the same family.

52
00:04:29,349 --> 00:04:31,283
I'm sorry, fellas. I'm doing a single.

53
00:04:31,451 --> 00:04:33,442
A singing, dancing, talking comedian.

54
00:04:33,620 --> 00:04:36,589
I love you, Leo, but since an hour ago,
I have a wife to take care of.

55
00:04:37,057 --> 00:04:38,547
I gotta start sometime.

56
00:04:38,725 --> 00:04:40,625
OK. Start.

57
00:04:40,794 --> 00:04:44,286
Well, what do you say, Leo,
do I make any sense?

58
00:04:44,531 --> 00:04:47,694
If you really mean what you just said,
you make sense.

59
00:04:47,867 --> 00:04:50,631
I think any man has a right
to do what he wants to...

60
00:04:50,804 --> 00:04:53,398
...providing he doesn't hurt anyone.

61
00:04:53,573 --> 00:04:55,939
But you've got to
have material, jokes.

62
00:04:56,109 --> 00:04:59,010
Well, I have Al Borden writing
an act for me right now.

63
00:04:59,179 --> 00:05:01,204
He's the greatest gagman
in America.

64
00:05:01,381 --> 00:05:03,246
- You think so?
- I do.

65
00:05:03,416 --> 00:05:05,680
That makes two of you. You and Al.

66
00:05:05,852 --> 00:05:07,979
Now, look, Leo,
will you leave that to me?

67
00:05:08,154 --> 00:05:12,215
All I want you to do is get the bookings
and you can start now.

68
00:05:14,894 --> 00:05:16,919
Oh, there you are.
Say, isn't there something

69
00:05:17,097 --> 00:05:19,565
about the groom dancing with
the bride on their wedding day?

70
00:05:19,733 --> 00:05:23,692
I'll bet you made that up.
Will you excuse us, Leo?

71
00:05:29,309 --> 00:05:31,300
- Well, Al Borden!
- Congratulations.

72
00:05:31,478 --> 00:05:34,038
Glad you came.
Excuse me, will you, honey?

73
00:05:34,214 --> 00:05:36,375
Say, are you serious?
You just got married.

74
00:05:36,549 --> 00:05:39,848
Thank you, Mr. Borden,
for my first wedding present.

75
00:05:40,220 --> 00:05:41,881
Leo.

76
00:05:42,055 --> 00:05:45,684
- Mary needs a partner.
- Mary isn't the only one.

77
00:05:46,393 --> 00:05:48,293
Al, listen...

78
00:05:50,664 --> 00:05:52,564
You don't think he's doing
the right thing, do you?

79
00:05:52,732 --> 00:05:54,359
You mean quitting Ben?

80
00:05:54,534 --> 00:05:56,764
As an agent, no.

81
00:05:57,303 --> 00:05:59,362
As a friend...

82
00:05:59,572 --> 00:06:02,871
And what about me
leaving Sutherland?

83
00:06:03,276 --> 00:06:04,743
Mary...

84
00:06:04,911 --> 00:06:08,540
...you leaving Sutherland after
all your hard work? And mine?

85
00:06:08,715 --> 00:06:11,206
Bill doesn't want me
to work anymore.

86
00:06:13,520 --> 00:06:16,785
Love, he can handle, but I wish he'd
leave the business end of it to me.

87
00:06:16,956 --> 00:06:19,891
You'll keep on looking out for him,
won't you, Leo?

88
00:06:20,126 --> 00:06:22,959
For ten percent, I'd look after
my own mother-in-law.

89
00:06:28,968 --> 00:06:31,869
Well, I wouldn't say she had buckteeth,
but she was the only girl I knew

90
00:06:32,038 --> 00:06:34,700
that could eat an apple
through a picket fence.

91
00:06:35,575 --> 00:06:37,475
That was funny.

92
00:06:39,212 --> 00:06:40,702
And so I said to the fellow,

93
00:06:40,880 --> 00:06:44,372
"If that's your wife, buddy,
you're in a lot of trouble."

94
00:06:45,118 --> 00:06:46,380
That was funny, wasn't it?

95
00:06:46,553 --> 00:06:49,647
- Yeah, that was funny 20 years ago.
- Well, don't worry.

96
00:06:49,823 --> 00:06:53,281
Once Bill starts to warm them up,
the audience will really go.

97
00:06:53,460 --> 00:06:56,952
They're going now.
Out of the theater.

98
00:06:57,664 --> 00:06:59,154
"Short, short story.

99
00:06:59,332 --> 00:07:01,698
"Ben Bailey broke in new partner,

100
00:07:01,868 --> 00:07:04,860
"socko Baltimore, ditto Boston,
ditto Washington."

101
00:07:05,038 --> 00:07:06,938
Here's the important part:

102
00:07:07,373 --> 00:07:09,841
"Bill Miller, single, 12 minutes.

103
00:07:10,009 --> 00:07:12,341
"Lays egg in Newark,

104
00:07:12,512 --> 00:07:15,379
"ditto Camden, ditto Wilkes-Barre,
ditto Scranton."

105
00:07:15,548 --> 00:07:17,812
- That wiseacre! I'll call those guys...
- Shut up!

106
00:07:17,984 --> 00:07:19,884
- What?
- I said, shut up.

107
00:07:20,053 --> 00:07:23,181
You've got yourself in a spot
because you got a swellhead.

108
00:07:23,356 --> 00:07:25,085
Some fairy godmother
must have whispered to you

109
00:07:25,258 --> 00:07:27,954
and told you that you
don't need nobody.

110
00:07:28,128 --> 00:07:30,858
Well, you better stop listening
to pixies and listen to your agent.

111
00:07:31,030 --> 00:07:33,362
You're not a single,
you never will be.

112
00:07:33,533 --> 00:07:35,865
You're a nice guy, and you got talent,
and you got a nice wife,

113
00:07:36,102 --> 00:07:38,730
but you're gonna blow them all off
if you don't start listening!

114
00:07:39,506 --> 00:07:41,497
Want to hear what's wrong
with your act?

115
00:07:41,674 --> 00:07:44,142
Well, sit down,
because I'm gonna tell you.

116
00:07:44,310 --> 00:07:47,939
You think that you can come out
and sing and be cute.

117
00:07:48,114 --> 00:07:49,581
Well, cute songs
are a nickel a dozen.

118
00:07:49,749 --> 00:07:53,276
You need a new opening.
A comedy song and two funny stories.

119
00:07:53,453 --> 00:07:56,251
Not those broken-down jokes
from Al Borden.

120
00:07:56,422 --> 00:07:58,822
And a finish.
Did you ever hear about that?

121
00:07:58,992 --> 00:08:00,857
A "San Francisco" finish.

122
00:08:01,027 --> 00:08:03,587
Cohan did it with a flag.
It's the most important thing of all!

123
00:08:03,763 --> 00:08:08,029
- Well, it's easy to tell me about it.
- Yeah? Well, here's how you do it.

124
00:08:08,668 --> 00:08:10,863
You go down to any
music publishing house,

125
00:08:11,037 --> 00:08:12,766
and you get one of those
schnook song pluggers.

126
00:08:12,939 --> 00:08:15,271
You put him out in the audience,
then you introduce him.

127
00:08:15,441 --> 00:08:17,909
- But I don't want any...
- Yes, there you go again!

128
00:08:18,077 --> 00:08:20,978
He's not your partner, he's a stooge!

129
00:08:21,514 --> 00:08:22,981
All you have to say is,

130
00:08:23,149 --> 00:08:25,515
"Ladies and gentlemen, we're very
lucky to have in the audience

131
00:08:25,685 --> 00:08:29,086
"this afternoon a Mr. Sam Jones
or Mr. Bruce Anybody,

132
00:08:29,255 --> 00:08:32,486
"the author of that big song hit,
'Your Father's Mustache'

133
00:08:32,659 --> 00:08:33,990
"or 'Your Uncle's Pistol'."

134
00:08:34,160 --> 00:08:37,755
Then you roust the guy around.
The audience laughs. It's sock.

135
00:08:37,931 --> 00:08:39,296
You think that'll be good?

136
00:08:39,465 --> 00:08:41,865
What do you want,
a sworn affidavit?

137
00:08:42,302 --> 00:08:45,237
I'll call Sam Robertson
and get you a guy.

138
00:08:45,638 --> 00:08:47,572
Now, get out of here, I'm busy.

139
00:08:50,710 --> 00:08:52,268
Hello?

140
00:08:52,445 --> 00:08:54,606
Hello, Leo.

141
00:08:54,781 --> 00:08:56,578
Yeah. Song plugger?

142
00:08:56,749 --> 00:08:59,445
Oh, no, Leo, I need all I've got.

143
00:09:04,190 --> 00:09:06,886
Wait a minute, Leo, wait a minute.

144
00:09:07,060 --> 00:09:09,494
I think I've got just the boy for you.

145
00:09:09,796 --> 00:09:13,027
Yes. Oh, you'll love this kid.

146
00:09:13,199 --> 00:09:16,828
Sure, you can pay him
what I pay him, 15 dollars a week.

147
00:09:17,070 --> 00:09:20,904
Yeah, he loves to sing
and he's smart as a whip.

148
00:09:21,074 --> 00:09:22,439
That's right.

149
00:09:22,609 --> 00:09:25,510
OK, Leo. Goodbye.

150
00:09:27,146 --> 00:09:28,670
Miss Reagan,

151
00:09:28,848 --> 00:09:30,941
what did that idiot do this time?

152
00:09:31,117 --> 00:09:32,516
He dropped a stack of records.

153
00:09:32,685 --> 00:09:34,812
- Is he bleeding?
- No, I don't think so.

154
00:09:34,988 --> 00:09:36,455
Oh, too bad.

155
00:09:36,623 --> 00:09:39,490
Well, anyway, I think
we're going to lose him.

156
00:09:39,993 --> 00:09:41,722
You mean they're gonna come
and take him away?

157
00:09:41,895 --> 00:09:45,228
No, but I've just put over the biggest
business deal of my career.

158
00:09:45,832 --> 00:09:47,925
- Where is he?
- He's on his lunch hour.

159
00:09:48,101 --> 00:09:50,069
He's allowed 30 minutes.

160
00:09:50,236 --> 00:09:53,433
Well, take his head out of the feedbag
and tell him I want to see him.

161
00:09:53,606 --> 00:09:55,972
He's very insistent
on that full half-hour.

162
00:09:56,142 --> 00:09:58,440
He puts great stress
on proper nourishment.

163
00:09:58,611 --> 00:10:00,579
You tell him I want
to see him right away!

164
00:10:00,747 --> 00:10:02,408
- Yes, sir.
- Miss Reagan.

165
00:10:02,582 --> 00:10:05,346
Tell me the truth.
Do you honestly think he's human?

166
00:10:06,019 --> 00:10:08,613
I've heard people bet both ways.

167
00:10:23,803 --> 00:10:25,703
Stick around, mister.
There'll be a spot in just a minute.

168
00:10:25,872 --> 00:10:27,237
Never mind.

169
00:10:27,573 --> 00:10:29,473
I would like to have...

170
00:10:32,946 --> 00:10:34,641
Could I...?

171
00:10:37,317 --> 00:10:39,285
Could I get a...?

172
00:10:39,686 --> 00:10:42,849
I would like to have a... A glass...

173
00:10:44,490 --> 00:10:46,321
What'll it be, bud?

174
00:10:46,492 --> 00:10:48,483
Oh, I'd like a glass
of hot water, please.

175
00:10:49,495 --> 00:10:51,929
- Hot water.
- Yeah.

176
00:11:05,778 --> 00:11:07,075
Thank you.

177
00:11:07,246 --> 00:11:09,544
- What'll you have with it?
- Oh, that's all.

178
00:11:09,716 --> 00:11:11,240
That's all?

179
00:11:11,417 --> 00:11:15,217
- Just hot water?
- Yeah, I want it for my tea.

180
00:11:26,799 --> 00:11:29,165
You've got a nerve.

181
00:11:29,335 --> 00:11:32,463
Driving away my customers
and making your own tea!

182
00:11:32,638 --> 00:11:34,629
Now, get out here! Beat it!

183
00:11:34,807 --> 00:11:38,299
You take your hands off me! I'll pay
you for the hot water, here's a nickel.

184
00:11:38,578 --> 00:11:40,546
Now, get out of here
and quit taking up space!

185
00:11:40,713 --> 00:11:42,908
Don't you put your hands on me!
I'll call a policeman!

186
00:11:43,082 --> 00:11:45,141
I paid for the hot water
and this a public restaurant

187
00:11:45,318 --> 00:11:48,310
and I've got a perfect right to sit here.
That's the law.

188
00:11:48,488 --> 00:11:49,887
- The law?
- You heard me.

189
00:11:50,056 --> 00:11:52,684
Look it up yourself in the code book
of the City of New York!

190
00:11:52,859 --> 00:11:55,453
Article nine, paragraph six, revised.

191
00:11:55,628 --> 00:11:59,564
And I got friends on the force.
Don't you give me no trouble.

192
00:12:01,534 --> 00:12:03,331
Excuse me.

193
00:12:14,080 --> 00:12:15,980
Well...

194
00:12:16,382 --> 00:12:18,043
...you got everything.

195
00:12:18,217 --> 00:12:21,050
That saves me a lot of trouble.

196
00:12:23,122 --> 00:12:24,783
Yeah, my mother makes
my lunch every morning,

197
00:12:24,957 --> 00:12:27,221
so I don't ruin my stomach
in these sloppy hash houses.

198
00:12:27,393 --> 00:12:30,760
Don't you touch me,
I got friends on the force!

199
00:12:45,311 --> 00:12:47,040
Thank you.

200
00:12:51,084 --> 00:12:53,018
I don't use pepper.

201
00:12:58,424 --> 00:12:59,823
Sugar?

202
00:12:59,992 --> 00:13:02,722
Oh, thank you. I beg your pardon.

203
00:13:07,033 --> 00:13:08,898
Cream or lemon?

204
00:13:09,068 --> 00:13:10,535
Oh, I always use cream.

205
00:13:10,703 --> 00:13:13,035
- Cream.
- But don't bother. I brung my own.

206
00:14:00,419 --> 00:14:02,717
I'm just trying to be helpful.

207
00:14:02,955 --> 00:14:05,822
- Thank you.
- You're welcome.

208
00:14:07,894 --> 00:14:09,657
That sandwich.

209
00:14:09,929 --> 00:14:12,898
Wouldn't you like me
to toast it for you?

210
00:14:13,065 --> 00:14:14,965
Oh, would you?

211
00:14:18,004 --> 00:14:19,995
That's it!

212
00:14:29,415 --> 00:14:32,043
Oh, you broke the whole hand!
You deformed me!

213
00:14:32,218 --> 00:14:34,618
Now, I won't be able to play
with the other children!

214
00:14:34,787 --> 00:14:38,052
What are you yapping about?
You still got four fingers left.

215
00:14:38,291 --> 00:14:41,317
Yeah, but when I grow up,
I might want to play the piano, maybe.

216
00:14:41,494 --> 00:14:43,428
You're running a very
unsanitary establishment.

217
00:14:43,596 --> 00:14:46,190
You can rest assured, I'm going to
report you to the Board of Health!

218
00:14:46,365 --> 00:14:48,390
Ted! I've been looking
all over for you!

219
00:14:48,568 --> 00:14:50,468
Mr. Robertson wants to see you
right away. Come on.

220
00:14:50,636 --> 00:14:51,898
Why didn't you find me sooner?

221
00:14:52,071 --> 00:14:55,632
I'm never coming back here again!
You just lost a customer!

222
00:14:58,311 --> 00:15:01,610
Oh, Ted, here's that
phonograph handle you wanted.

223
00:15:01,781 --> 00:15:05,581
Oh, thanks, Duzik. I'll give you the
money for it on payday. Miss Reagan...

224
00:15:05,751 --> 00:15:08,845
Hurry up. You're three minutes
past your half-hour.

225
00:15:09,021 --> 00:15:10,545
- Yeah, but Miss Reagan...
- Ted!

226
00:15:24,203 --> 00:15:28,139
I'm sorry, Mr. Robertson.
I'll give you the money for it on payday.

227
00:15:28,307 --> 00:15:33,074
Careful, Ted, don't cut
your throat on my time.

228
00:15:33,879 --> 00:15:36,040
Mr. Robertson, it was an accident!
I didn't mean to do it.

229
00:15:36,215 --> 00:15:37,876
I had Duzik's phonograph handle

230
00:15:38,050 --> 00:15:39,950
and I was just gonna knock
on the door, that's all.

231
00:15:40,119 --> 00:15:41,780
- Come in, boy.
- Don't pick on a little guy.

232
00:15:41,954 --> 00:15:43,751
It's all right, don't get excited.

233
00:15:43,923 --> 00:15:46,118
Sit down, son.

234
00:15:46,792 --> 00:15:49,659
- Me?
- Yes, sit down.

235
00:15:49,996 --> 00:15:53,090
Well, Bill, there's your man.

236
00:15:53,266 --> 00:15:55,826
Hit where there's padding.
Hit where there's padding!

237
00:15:56,002 --> 00:15:57,401
- Come on, kid.
- What do I do?

238
00:15:57,570 --> 00:15:59,401
Just go right ahead with him,
that's all.

239
00:15:59,572 --> 00:16:02,097
- Oh, I'm sorry, sir.
- Grab those, huh, kid?

240
00:16:02,275 --> 00:16:06,473
- You want I should go with him?
- More than anything in the world.

241
00:16:08,080 --> 00:16:12,779
I'm sorry, Mr. Robertson.
I'll pay you for that on payday.

242
00:16:15,721 --> 00:16:18,155
He sings too, huh?

243
00:16:21,861 --> 00:16:24,159
Good luck, Mr. Miller.

244
00:16:38,477 --> 00:16:40,468
Hello, sweetie.

245
00:16:40,980 --> 00:16:43,141
Myrtle Theatre, Brooklyn.

246
00:16:51,657 --> 00:16:52,919
How are you, sweetheart?

247
00:16:53,092 --> 00:16:55,322
You wouldn't mind telling me
where you were the last hour?

248
00:16:55,494 --> 00:16:57,359
I was working, doll.
I was getting some new jokes.

249
00:16:57,530 --> 00:16:59,259
- I'll bet.
- From Al Borden.

250
00:16:59,432 --> 00:17:00,956
Why don't you marry him?

251
00:17:01,133 --> 00:17:04,591
- That's not funny.
- Neither are his jokes.

252
00:17:09,442 --> 00:17:12,775
Mary. Mary...

253
00:17:13,813 --> 00:17:16,509
...l'm sorry.
- That's very nice of you.

254
00:17:16,682 --> 00:17:18,775
Well, I am. You know how
important this is to me.

255
00:17:18,951 --> 00:17:20,248
Well, I'm pretty fed up.

256
00:17:20,419 --> 00:17:22,819
Ever since the day we were married,
all I've heard is Al Borden

257
00:17:22,988 --> 00:17:25,115
and his jokes and the act.

258
00:17:25,291 --> 00:17:28,226
That's a fine way to talk.
You know I'm trying to make good.

259
00:17:28,394 --> 00:17:31,386
All right, then, let's not talk.

260
00:17:36,602 --> 00:17:38,126
Mary!

261
00:17:39,105 --> 00:17:40,402
Hey!

262
00:17:40,573 --> 00:17:44,168
Oh, take care of this, will you, kid, and
I'll see you in the dressing room. Mary!

263
00:17:44,343 --> 00:17:46,243
Six dollars, buster.

264
00:17:46,412 --> 00:17:48,403
Oh, that's very reasonable
for such a nice cab.

265
00:17:48,581 --> 00:17:50,674
Now, hold it.
That's the fare, birdbrain.

266
00:17:50,850 --> 00:17:53,648
Now, pay me or
I'll charge you for waiting.

267
00:18:07,566 --> 00:18:11,366
You don't believe in keeping
all your eggs in one basket, do you?

268
00:18:12,772 --> 00:18:16,367
Wait a minute, that's only five.
I said six, didn't I?

269
00:18:28,287 --> 00:18:30,687
- Could I have some back?
- What?

270
00:18:30,856 --> 00:18:33,654
Well, then could I just have a nickel
for carfare or a cup of coffee?

271
00:18:33,826 --> 00:18:36,761
You panhandler.

272
00:18:45,438 --> 00:18:47,030
Hey!

273
00:18:48,307 --> 00:18:51,538
<i>Lover, when I'm near you</i>

274
00:18:51,710 --> 00:18:56,374
<i>And I hear you speak my name</i>

275
00:18:56,549 --> 00:18:57,948
<i>Softly... </i>

276
00:18:58,117 --> 00:18:59,675
Quiet!

277
00:19:00,352 --> 00:19:03,788
Oh, please get out of the way.
Our cue is on.

278
00:19:04,523 --> 00:19:08,357
<i>Lover, when we're dancing</i>

279
00:19:08,527 --> 00:19:10,188
- Quiet.
- Quiet, schmiet.

280
00:19:10,362 --> 00:19:11,829
You try and be quiet.

281
00:19:11,997 --> 00:19:15,398
You try and be quiet,
carrying these bags.

282
00:19:15,568 --> 00:19:19,368
<i>... entrancing music dies</i>

283
00:19:21,340 --> 00:19:22,773
Still mad?

284
00:19:22,942 --> 00:19:24,807
No, how can I stay angry with you?

285
00:19:24,977 --> 00:19:27,411
I'm sorry about last night,
but it's like I told you, honey.

286
00:19:27,580 --> 00:19:29,514
I want to get up there
where you'll be proud of me.

287
00:19:29,682 --> 00:19:32,242
And sometimes I'm in such a hurry,
I just get carried away.

288
00:19:35,020 --> 00:19:37,215
- Oh, come on in, kid.
- I'm sorry, Mr. Miller,

289
00:19:37,389 --> 00:19:41,018
- But if you won't need me anymore...
- Put the big one up there.

290
00:19:43,162 --> 00:19:45,653
Watch that. Easy!

291
00:19:48,334 --> 00:19:50,063
- Yes?
- Five minutes, Mr. Miller.

292
00:19:50,236 --> 00:19:51,897
OK.

293
00:19:52,071 --> 00:19:54,039
Mr. Miller, would you like
me to put this away?

294
00:19:54,206 --> 00:19:55,901
Yeah.

295
00:19:56,942 --> 00:19:59,103
Come on, let's go, Mary.

296
00:20:00,980 --> 00:20:02,914
Come on, kid!

297
00:20:03,516 --> 00:20:07,646
Mr. Miller, I better be getting back.
Mr. Robertson's gonna miss me.

298
00:20:07,820 --> 00:20:09,651
- See that box?
- Yeah.

299
00:20:09,822 --> 00:20:11,687
- You go on up there.
- Oh, to see the show?

300
00:20:11,857 --> 00:20:14,223
Thanks, Mr. Miller.

301
00:20:15,127 --> 00:20:17,425
- For free?
- Yeah. Go right through there.

302
00:20:17,596 --> 00:20:18,858
Good luck, darling.

303
00:20:22,201 --> 00:20:23,463
And good luck to you too.

304
00:20:28,741 --> 00:20:30,333
You're on.

305
00:20:45,384 --> 00:20:47,909
Oh, I'm sorry, lady!

306
00:20:48,254 --> 00:20:50,188
Oh, that's all right.

307
00:20:50,356 --> 00:20:52,551
<i>Ask the sky above</i>

308
00:20:52,725 --> 00:20:55,285
<i>And ask the earth below</i>

309
00:20:55,461 --> 00:21:00,455
<i>Why I'm so in love</i>
<i>And why I love you so</i>

310
00:21:00,766 --> 00:21:04,793
<i>Couldn't tell you though I try, dear</i>

311
00:21:04,970 --> 00:21:09,532
<i>Just why, dear, I'm yours</i>

312
00:21:10,309 --> 00:21:12,300
<i>When you went away</i>

313
00:21:12,478 --> 00:21:15,276
<i>You left a glowing spark</i>

314
00:21:15,448 --> 00:21:20,215
<i>Trying to be gay</i>
<i>Is whistling in the dark</i>

315
00:21:20,386 --> 00:21:24,516
<i>I am only what you make me</i>

316
00:21:24,690 --> 00:21:26,885
<i>Come take me</i>

317
00:21:27,059 --> 00:21:28,321
<i>I'm yours</i>

318
00:21:28,494 --> 00:21:29,825
<i>How happy</i>

319
00:21:30,396 --> 00:21:33,763
<i>I would be to beg and borrow</i>

320
00:21:33,933 --> 00:21:37,528
<i>Or sorrow with you</i>

321
00:21:37,703 --> 00:21:41,002
<i>Even though I knew tomorrow</i>

322
00:21:41,173 --> 00:21:45,507
<i>You'd say we were through</i>

323
00:21:47,246 --> 00:21:49,646
<i>If we drift apart</i>

324
00:21:49,815 --> 00:21:52,306
<i>Then I'll be lost alone</i>

325
00:21:52,485 --> 00:21:57,388
<i>Though you use my heart</i>
<i>For just a stepping stone</i>

326
00:21:57,556 --> 00:22:02,653
<i>How can I help dreaming of you</i>

327
00:22:02,962 --> 00:22:05,795
<i>I love you</i>

328
00:22:05,965 --> 00:22:10,527
<i>I'm yours</i>

329
00:22:14,707 --> 00:22:16,504
You brought me out for this?

330
00:22:16,675 --> 00:22:17,937
Take it easy, Frank.

331
00:22:21,347 --> 00:22:22,905
Thank you. And now, ladies...

332
00:22:23,082 --> 00:22:26,210
Thank you. All right, all right.

333
00:22:26,385 --> 00:22:27,943
Thank you very much,
ladies and gentlemen.

334
00:22:28,120 --> 00:22:30,611
Now I have a treat for you.
Something you're getting for nothing.

335
00:22:30,789 --> 00:22:32,984
Did you ever hear of a fellow
named Jimmy Lyons?

336
00:22:33,158 --> 00:22:35,023
For your information,
Jimmy Lyons is the fellow

337
00:22:35,194 --> 00:22:37,253
that wrote one of the
greatest hits around today.

338
00:22:37,429 --> 00:22:38,919
A song called "For You".

339
00:22:39,098 --> 00:22:41,225
- Is he kidding?
- Give him a chance.

340
00:22:41,400 --> 00:22:43,994
And it just so happens we have
Jimmy Lyons in our audience today.

341
00:22:44,169 --> 00:22:47,764
Let's have him take a bow.
House lights!

342
00:22:53,646 --> 00:22:56,206
- No, you!
- Me?

343
00:22:56,382 --> 00:22:58,475
Come on, stand up,
take a bow. Don't be shy.

344
00:22:58,651 --> 00:23:00,619
Get up. Come on.

345
00:23:03,656 --> 00:23:05,920
Oh, lady! Lady!

346
00:23:06,091 --> 00:23:09,254
Lady! Lady! Oh, lady!

347
00:23:09,428 --> 00:23:11,396
Mr. Miller!

348
00:23:26,245 --> 00:23:30,113
- Gee, you're strong.
- You're cute.

349
00:23:30,649 --> 00:23:33,243
- I'm getting out of here!
- Oh, no!

350
00:23:33,419 --> 00:23:36,217
Come on, let's get him to sing, huh?
Come on, applaud.

351
00:23:39,391 --> 00:23:43,384
Go on. Don't be stuck up. Sing.

352
00:23:44,563 --> 00:23:46,224
All right.

353
00:23:48,000 --> 00:23:49,433
Nothing came out.

354
00:23:49,635 --> 00:23:51,364
Hit it.

355
00:23:56,308 --> 00:23:58,970
<i>Ask the sky above</i>

356
00:23:59,144 --> 00:24:01,612
<i>And ask the earth below</i>

357
00:24:02,681 --> 00:24:05,172
<i>Why I'm so in love</i>

358
00:24:05,351 --> 00:24:07,683
<i>And why I love you so</i>

359
00:24:08,988 --> 00:24:13,448
<i>Couldn't tell you though I try, dear</i>

360
00:24:13,626 --> 00:24:15,890
<i>Just why, dear</i>

361
00:24:16,362 --> 00:24:19,798
<i>I'm yours</i>

362
00:24:19,965 --> 00:24:22,365
<i>When you went away</i>

363
00:24:22,534 --> 00:24:25,264
<i>You left a glowing spark</i>

364
00:24:25,437 --> 00:24:27,871
<i>Trying to be gay</i>

365
00:24:28,073 --> 00:24:31,167
<i>Is like whistling in the dark</i>

366
00:24:31,343 --> 00:24:36,406
<i>I am only what you make me</i>

367
00:24:38,317 --> 00:24:39,841
What are you laughing at?

368
00:24:40,019 --> 00:24:42,078
Say, what kind of a voice
do you have?

369
00:24:42,254 --> 00:24:44,779
Until I was 18, I was a soprano.

370
00:24:44,957 --> 00:24:46,788
Soprano?

371
00:24:46,959 --> 00:24:49,792
Yeah, but then my mother
told me I was born a boy.

372
00:24:49,962 --> 00:24:51,395
Don't tell me you were born.

373
00:24:52,231 --> 00:24:54,199
What do you think,
I came from an egg?

374
00:24:54,366 --> 00:24:55,799
No, the chicken would have buried it.

375
00:24:55,968 --> 00:24:57,663
Ha-ha. Well, my mother loves me.

376
00:24:57,836 --> 00:25:00,236
I'll bet she was disappointed,
I'll bet she wanted a child.

377
00:25:01,006 --> 00:25:05,033
She got one! Look up the records.
I was born at the Mercy Hospital.

378
00:25:05,210 --> 00:25:08,941
- What's the matter, were you sick?
- No, I wanted to be near my mother.

379
00:25:09,348 --> 00:25:11,680
Mercy Hospital.
That's in Brooklyn, isn't it?

380
00:25:11,850 --> 00:25:13,647
What's wrong with Brooklyn?

381
00:25:13,819 --> 00:25:16,344
Any big men born in Brooklyn?

382
00:25:16,522 --> 00:25:18,422
No, just babies.

383
00:25:19,758 --> 00:25:21,282
How about "For You"?

384
00:25:21,660 --> 00:25:24,891
- For you? How about for me?
- No, what about it?

385
00:25:25,064 --> 00:25:26,361
How about what?

386
00:25:26,532 --> 00:25:28,295
"For You".

387
00:25:28,767 --> 00:25:31,327
- You said that!
- I know it.

388
00:25:31,503 --> 00:25:32,902
What about it?

389
00:25:33,072 --> 00:25:35,632
- Sing it.
- Sing what?

390
00:25:35,874 --> 00:25:39,002
- "For You".
- I don't know it!

391
00:25:39,178 --> 00:25:40,645
Well, "Who's Your Little Whozis?"

392
00:25:40,813 --> 00:25:42,110
None of your business!

393
00:25:42,281 --> 00:25:43,908
No, I mean, sing it!

394
00:25:44,083 --> 00:25:46,313
All right, but stop hollering.

395
00:25:46,652 --> 00:25:49,143
- I'll start it.
- Go ahead.

396
00:25:50,622 --> 00:25:52,214
Hit it.

397
00:25:54,860 --> 00:25:56,555
<i>Who's your little whozis? </i>

398
00:25:56,729 --> 00:25:58,219
<i>Who's your little whozis? </i>

399
00:25:58,397 --> 00:26:00,024
<i>Who's your turtledove? </i>

400
00:26:00,199 --> 00:26:01,689
<i>Who's your turtledove? </i>

401
00:26:01,867 --> 00:26:03,664
<i>Who's your little whozis? </i>

402
00:26:04,303 --> 00:26:06,362
- <i>Who do you</i>
- <i>Who do you</i>

403
00:26:06,538 --> 00:26:08,631
You don't wanna help me?

404
00:26:08,807 --> 00:26:10,274
<i>Who's your little whatzis? </i>

405
00:26:10,442 --> 00:26:11,932
<i>Who's your little whatzis? </i>

406
00:26:12,111 --> 00:26:13,772
<i>That you're dreaming of</i>

407
00:26:13,946 --> 00:26:15,470
<i>That you're dreaming of</i>

408
00:26:15,647 --> 00:26:17,945
<i>Who's your little whozis? </i>

409
00:26:18,117 --> 00:26:19,709
<i>Who do you love? </i>

410
00:26:19,885 --> 00:26:21,648
<i>Who do you love? </i>

411
00:26:21,820 --> 00:26:25,517
<i>Tell me who has you aflutter</i>

412
00:26:25,691 --> 00:26:28,922
<i>Whenever they're passing by? </i>

413
00:26:29,094 --> 00:26:31,927
<i>Melts your heart like butter</i>

414
00:26:32,097 --> 00:26:35,726
<i>Oh, me! Oh, my! Say</i>

415
00:26:35,901 --> 00:26:39,234
- <i>When you get the blueses</i>
- <i>When you get the blueses</i>

416
00:26:39,404 --> 00:26:40,928
<i>Who you thinking of? </i>

417
00:26:41,106 --> 00:26:42,835
<i>Who you thinking of? </i>

418
00:26:43,008 --> 00:26:46,705
<i>Who's your little whozis? </i>

419
00:26:46,879 --> 00:26:49,347
<i>Who do you... </i>

420
00:26:50,015 --> 00:26:52,609
<i>Who do you... </i>

421
00:26:52,785 --> 00:26:55,549
- <i>Who do you... </i>
- Love, love!

422
00:26:55,721 --> 00:26:58,189
Oh. <i>Love</i>

423
00:27:02,528 --> 00:27:04,758
Gee, you're cute!
Where you gonna play next week?

424
00:27:04,930 --> 00:27:06,989
What are you, a wise guy?

425
00:27:12,404 --> 00:27:15,100
- Just listen to them!
- Don't you think you should have...?

426
00:27:15,274 --> 00:27:17,071
- The fellow take a bow?
- Who?

427
00:27:17,242 --> 00:27:20,006
- The fellow in the box.
- Oh, sure.

428
00:27:24,550 --> 00:27:26,279
See what I mean.
If you just keep punching...

429
00:27:26,451 --> 00:27:27,884
Darling...

430
00:27:28,053 --> 00:27:30,817
I don't know whether
I'll let you book him now.

431
00:27:34,827 --> 00:27:35,953
Come in.

432
00:27:36,128 --> 00:27:37,288
- Hello, Mary.
- Hello, Leo.

433
00:27:37,462 --> 00:27:39,453
That's more like it.
Congratulations, Bill.

434
00:27:39,631 --> 00:27:41,895
- You know Frank Darling here.
- Oh, hi, Frank.

435
00:27:42,067 --> 00:27:43,694
- Mrs. Miller.
- Mrs. Miller, how do you do?

436
00:27:43,869 --> 00:27:45,996
Well, Frank here wants to book you
on the Orpheum Circuit

437
00:27:46,171 --> 00:27:47,195
for about ten or 12 weeks.

438
00:27:47,372 --> 00:27:49,738
- What did I tell you, Mary?
- That's right.

439
00:27:49,908 --> 00:27:51,535
You and what's-his-name.

440
00:27:52,311 --> 00:27:55,474
- Who?
- The stooge in the box.

441
00:27:55,747 --> 00:27:58,181
That's right. Where is he?

442
00:28:02,287 --> 00:28:04,016
- Did you see him, Mary?
- No, dear.

443
00:28:04,189 --> 00:28:06,248
- By the way, what's his name?
- What?

444
00:28:06,425 --> 00:28:08,325
- What's his name?
- What's his name?

445
00:28:08,493 --> 00:28:10,723
Well, no one told me.
I never saw him before.

446
00:28:10,896 --> 00:28:12,727
That's fine. Leo...

447
00:28:12,898 --> 00:28:14,889
How should I know,
I've never seen him before either.

448
00:28:15,067 --> 00:28:17,160
- Somebody better find him.
- You're not kidding.

449
00:28:18,303 --> 00:28:19,895
And when you do,
put a ring through his nose.

450
00:28:23,542 --> 00:28:25,908
Gee, Ma, I didn't know
he was gonna ask me to sing.

451
00:28:26,078 --> 00:28:27,739
And everybody laughed at me.

452
00:28:27,913 --> 00:28:31,542
Now, don't worry. It's all over.

453
00:28:33,785 --> 00:28:35,275
I ran all the way home.

454
00:28:35,454 --> 00:28:37,422
It's a wonder I didn't get
runned over.

455
00:28:37,589 --> 00:28:41,457
Theodore, it's done with.
Don't make a big thing of it.

456
00:28:41,627 --> 00:28:44,721
Big thing of it.
You should see this guy, Ma!

457
00:28:44,897 --> 00:28:48,162
Boy, if he ever got his hands on me,
he'd probably choke me to death.

458
00:28:55,274 --> 00:28:57,367
Ma! Ma! The man. The man's coming!

459
00:28:57,542 --> 00:28:59,066
Who's coming?
What are you talking about?

460
00:28:59,244 --> 00:29:01,906
- The guy! Ma, the guy with the act!
- Theodore!

461
00:29:02,080 --> 00:29:04,844
Oh, Ma, I gotta get out of here!

462
00:29:06,151 --> 00:29:08,881
Ma. Ma, don't say nothing. Ma.

463
00:29:09,054 --> 00:29:10,612
Theodore. What are you doing?

464
00:29:10,789 --> 00:29:13,053
Don't say a word.
Give me your glasses, Ma.

465
00:29:13,225 --> 00:29:15,056
He won't know me.

466
00:29:15,394 --> 00:29:16,520
Theodore!

467
00:29:17,963 --> 00:29:21,421
- Coming!
- Theodore, where are you?

468
00:29:22,768 --> 00:29:25,168
Wrong apartment.

469
00:29:29,541 --> 00:29:32,669
- Does Ted Rogers live here?
- Ted Rogers?

470
00:29:32,844 --> 00:29:36,280
Mother, didn't Ted say he was going
to South America this afternoon?

471
00:29:36,448 --> 00:29:38,882
Oh, who do we know there?

472
00:29:39,051 --> 00:29:41,076
Yes, that's right.
Yes, he left this afternoon.

473
00:29:41,253 --> 00:29:44,154
Fine boy, fine boy, that Ted.
Smart as a whip.

474
00:29:44,323 --> 00:29:45,585
Hey, what are you trying to do?

475
00:29:45,757 --> 00:29:48,123
You wouldn't hit a man wearing
his mother's glasses, would you?

476
00:29:48,293 --> 00:29:49,521
Now, look...

477
00:29:51,229 --> 00:29:54,494
Why, Uncle Sholum,
how did you get here?

478
00:29:54,666 --> 00:29:59,296
- No, Ma, it's me, Theodore!
- Oh.

479
00:30:00,305 --> 00:30:03,331
Now, look here, mister, it wasn't my
fault those people laughed at me.

480
00:30:03,508 --> 00:30:05,032
You should never have
got me to stand up

481
00:30:05,210 --> 00:30:07,235
and you shouldn't have had them
put that light on me.

482
00:30:07,412 --> 00:30:09,073
I didn't mean to...

483
00:30:09,247 --> 00:30:11,681
- Well, I apologize.
- You apologize?

484
00:30:11,850 --> 00:30:14,148
And you don't have to give me
the $6 for the cab back, even.

485
00:30:14,319 --> 00:30:16,879
Oh, I nearly forgot. I brought it
over for you. There you are.

486
00:30:17,055 --> 00:30:19,819
- Oh, thank you.
- And here's your cap.

487
00:30:21,426 --> 00:30:23,417
No, look, I had the orchestra
play the song up high

488
00:30:23,595 --> 00:30:26,223
so the people would laugh at you.
I had it planned that way.

489
00:30:26,398 --> 00:30:29,299
- You wanted they should laugh at me?
- Sure.

490
00:30:29,468 --> 00:30:32,198
You hear that, Ma?
I was supposed to be funny.

491
00:30:38,076 --> 00:30:40,135
Look, how much does
Mr. Robertson pay you a week?

492
00:30:40,312 --> 00:30:41,939
Oh, 15 dollars a week.

493
00:30:42,114 --> 00:30:44,241
But I owe him for the glass
in the office,

494
00:30:44,416 --> 00:30:46,611
and I owe him for the glass
in the bookcase,

495
00:30:46,785 --> 00:30:49,948
and this week, I think
for three stacks of records.

496
00:30:50,856 --> 00:30:55,350
Mom, take a look at a
$40-a-week man, all expenses paid.

497
00:30:55,527 --> 00:30:57,392
- What?
- That's right.

498
00:30:57,562 --> 00:31:01,396
I'm paying you 40 dollars a week
and expenses. You're working for me.

499
00:31:01,633 --> 00:31:04,500
Now, look here, sir, I am not
going to do anything dishonest,

500
00:31:04,669 --> 00:31:05,931
even for that kind of money!

501
00:31:06,104 --> 00:31:08,436
No, you do exactly
what you did today.

502
00:31:08,607 --> 00:31:11,075
- Sit in the box and say those things?
- Right.

503
00:31:11,243 --> 00:31:13,905
- Do I get to sing?
- You bet.

504
00:31:14,079 --> 00:31:18,072
- Even if I sing, I still get paid?
- Well, sure.

505
00:31:18,483 --> 00:31:20,144
Ma...

506
00:31:28,660 --> 00:31:30,719
I'll ask him.

507
00:31:36,468 --> 00:31:38,868
Mister, my mother and I
would like to know something.

508
00:31:39,037 --> 00:31:41,870
- Yes?
- Are you for real?

509
00:31:42,040 --> 00:31:45,908
Yeah, I'm for real.
We got a deal, kid?

510
00:31:49,448 --> 00:31:51,348
- We got a deal.
- OK.

511
00:31:51,516 --> 00:31:54,781
Here, save the gags for the act.

512
00:31:55,287 --> 00:31:58,552
Well, I guess the only thing that
can come between us is dough.

513
00:32:13,672 --> 00:32:15,902
Hey, how many of those carrots
you eat before going to bed?

514
00:32:16,074 --> 00:32:18,440
Oh, lots of them.
They're very good for your eyes.

515
00:32:18,610 --> 00:32:20,202
Good for your eyes?

516
00:32:20,378 --> 00:32:23,347
Sure. Did you ever see
a rabbit with glasses?

517
00:32:23,582 --> 00:32:26,813
- Oh, you want one?
- No, thank you.

518
00:32:29,721 --> 00:32:31,780
I've never been away
from home before.

519
00:32:34,092 --> 00:32:36,458
I don't know whether my mother
was crying because she was happy

520
00:32:36,628 --> 00:32:38,926
or because she was upset.

521
00:32:40,432 --> 00:32:42,229
You know, you have
a wonderful wife, Mr. Miller.

522
00:32:42,400 --> 00:32:45,460
She's so beautiful and so nice.

523
00:32:46,171 --> 00:32:48,366
Aren't you gonna brush your teeth
before you go to bed?

524
00:32:48,540 --> 00:32:50,633
Well, of course.

525
00:33:02,087 --> 00:33:05,181
Mr. Miller, there's crooks
on the train!

526
00:33:05,357 --> 00:33:07,382
- What do you mean?
- Well, somebody stole the sink!

527
00:33:07,559 --> 00:33:10,255
I better go tell the conductor.
They'll make us pay for it.

528
00:33:10,428 --> 00:33:15,229
Take it easy. All you do is press the
button, pull the handle and it's there.

529
00:34:23,368 --> 00:34:27,702
Oh, Mr. Miller! Mr. Miller!

530
00:34:30,275 --> 00:34:32,869
Mr. Miller!

531
00:34:33,044 --> 00:34:35,945
Oh, Mr. Miller!

532
00:34:40,885 --> 00:34:44,844
You'd better get to bed
before you drown yourself.

533
00:35:24,763 --> 00:35:26,424
Good night, Mr. Miller.

534
00:35:26,598 --> 00:35:29,328
You, go up there.

535
00:35:30,669 --> 00:35:32,933
You, up there.

536
00:35:47,052 --> 00:35:48,679
Well, how am I supposed
to get up there?

537
00:35:48,853 --> 00:35:52,050
Use the steps. Use the steps.

538
00:35:54,592 --> 00:35:56,924
Put this up there.

539
00:36:20,585 --> 00:36:22,644
- Mr. Miller?
- Yes?

540
00:36:22,821 --> 00:36:25,346
How do you put these lights out?

541
00:36:25,523 --> 00:36:27,616
There's a switch up there, kid.
Use it.

542
00:37:19,010 --> 00:37:21,444
- Mr. Miller.
- What?

543
00:37:21,613 --> 00:37:23,274
How far are we from New York?

544
00:37:23,615 --> 00:37:26,641
Oh, I don't know. About 200 miles.

545
00:37:26,985 --> 00:37:29,954
- Gee, I'm homesick.
- No, that's just the carrots.

546
00:37:30,789 --> 00:37:35,283
No. From carrots, I get nauseous.
I'm just lonely.

547
00:37:36,494 --> 00:37:38,291
Mr. Miller, my mother sings
me to sleep.

548
00:37:38,596 --> 00:37:40,496
I am not your mother.

549
00:37:41,666 --> 00:37:43,497
Isn't that silly?
I know you're not my mother

550
00:37:43,668 --> 00:37:45,192
because my mother's a woman,

551
00:37:45,370 --> 00:37:47,235
and you don't look
anything like my mother.

552
00:37:47,405 --> 00:37:49,498
Besides, my mother
isn't married to Mary.

553
00:37:49,674 --> 00:37:52,006
That's the most ridiculous thing
I ever heard, Mr. Miller.

554
00:37:52,177 --> 00:37:53,576
You could no more be
my mother than...

555
00:37:53,745 --> 00:37:56,805
All right, go to sleep. I'll sing to you.

556
00:37:57,015 --> 00:37:58,949
Gee, thanks.

557
00:38:06,991 --> 00:38:11,519
<i>With my eyes wide open</i>

558
00:38:11,696 --> 00:38:14,096
<i>I'm dreaming</i>

559
00:38:15,533 --> 00:38:19,264
<i>Can it be true</i>
<i>I'm holding you</i>

560
00:38:19,437 --> 00:38:22,429
<i>Close to my heart? </i>

561
00:38:24,242 --> 00:38:28,303
<i>With my eyes wide open</i>

562
00:38:28,880 --> 00:38:31,144
<i>I'm dreaming</i>

563
00:38:32,417 --> 00:38:36,547
<i>You're with me now</i>
<i>Sharing a vow</i>

564
00:38:36,988 --> 00:38:39,786
<i>Never to part</i>

565
00:38:42,327 --> 00:38:45,785
<i>I'm so afraid to close my eyes</i>

566
00:38:45,964 --> 00:38:48,694
<i>Afraid that I'll find</i>

567
00:38:49,767 --> 00:38:53,567
<i>This lovely thrill is just</i>

568
00:38:53,738 --> 00:38:56,332
<i>A silly illusion</i>

569
00:38:58,209 --> 00:39:02,339
<i>With my eyes wide open</i>

570
00:39:02,847 --> 00:39:05,509
<i>I'm dreaming</i>

571
00:39:07,252 --> 00:39:10,881
<i>Do I deserve such a break? </i>

572
00:39:11,656 --> 00:39:15,114
<i>Pinch me to prove I'm awake</i>

573
00:39:15,927 --> 00:39:21,456
<i>I can't believe that you're really</i>

574
00:39:23,968 --> 00:39:26,698
<i>Mine</i>

575
00:39:48,020 --> 00:39:52,184
<i>I feel a song coming on</i>

576
00:39:52,558 --> 00:39:58,428
<i>And I'm warning you, it's a victorious</i>
<i>Happy and glorious strain</i>

577
00:40:12,611 --> 00:40:17,275
<i>I feel a song coming on</i>

578
00:40:17,449 --> 00:40:22,887
<i>It's a melody full of the laughter</i>
<i>Of children out after the rain</i>

579
00:40:37,836 --> 00:40:39,736
- <i>And now</i>
- <i>And now</i>

580
00:40:39,905 --> 00:40:42,635
- <i>That our troubles are gone</i>
- <i>That our troubles are gone</i>

581
00:40:42,808 --> 00:40:46,209
<i>Let those heavenly drums</i>
<i>Go on drumming</i>

582
00:40:46,378 --> 00:40:52,078
<i>'Cause I feel a song coming on</i>

583
00:41:01,860 --> 00:41:04,328
Now, you'll be all right.

584
00:41:04,596 --> 00:41:06,086
There.

585
00:41:08,533 --> 00:41:11,434
Hi, Pop. Did Mr. Miller get back
from the party yet?

586
00:41:11,603 --> 00:41:13,571
He sure did.

587
00:41:13,739 --> 00:41:16,731
Bill. I got him.

588
00:41:16,909 --> 00:41:20,470
- There you are.
- Take your hands off of me.

589
00:41:20,646 --> 00:41:22,580
I'll take care of him, Pop.
How much time we got?

590
00:41:22,748 --> 00:41:24,682
About six minutes. Heinz is on now.

591
00:41:24,850 --> 00:41:26,477
We don't have much time.
We gotta work fast.

592
00:41:26,652 --> 00:41:28,552
- Let go of me...
- I'll get some black coffee.

593
00:41:28,720 --> 00:41:30,153
OK.

594
00:41:30,956 --> 00:41:35,086
Come on, stop. I know it,
I gotta get dressed and I gotta go on.

595
00:41:35,260 --> 00:41:37,455
Don't "shush" me.
What, are you taking over?

596
00:41:37,629 --> 00:41:39,028
What, are you head man
or something?

597
00:41:39,197 --> 00:41:41,290
Bill, take it easy, Bill, will you?
Snap out of it.

598
00:41:41,466 --> 00:41:43,991
- We're going on in five minutes.
- I'm ready right now.

599
00:41:44,169 --> 00:41:46,160
Here, I'll help you.

600
00:41:50,208 --> 00:41:52,403
I'll help you dress, Bill.

601
00:41:52,577 --> 00:41:54,704
- Here's the coffee.
- Oh, thank you.

602
00:41:56,081 --> 00:41:58,481
- Coffee, Mr. Winston?
- No. Fine.

603
00:41:58,650 --> 00:42:01,744
- Stewed to the gills.
- Oh, no, sir. He's just tired.

604
00:42:01,920 --> 00:42:05,321
Tired? He's paralyzed.
Tell Heinz to stall. Hurry up.

605
00:42:05,490 --> 00:42:07,754
- Come on, snap out of it, Bill.
- Rogers, he'll never make it.

606
00:42:07,926 --> 00:42:09,689
You'll have to go out there alone
and do something.

607
00:42:09,861 --> 00:42:12,295
Me, alone? I can't. What'll I do?

608
00:42:12,464 --> 00:42:13,988
Do anything.
You're an actor, aren't you?

609
00:42:14,166 --> 00:42:16,157
I am?

610
00:42:17,202 --> 00:42:18,464
What're you gonna do with that?

611
00:42:18,637 --> 00:42:20,969
Well, in case anyone throws anything,
I can hide behind it.

612
00:42:21,139 --> 00:42:24,074
Gee, Mr. Winston, I'm sorry about
Mr. Miller. He's never...

613
00:42:24,242 --> 00:42:25,869
- What is it?
- Heinz stole three more bows.

614
00:42:26,044 --> 00:42:29,275
- He can't stall any longer.
- Come on, boy.

615
00:42:29,448 --> 00:42:31,712
He's never done that before.

616
00:42:41,960 --> 00:42:43,484
I don't think you know
what you're doing.

617
00:42:43,662 --> 00:42:45,186
Never mind. Get out there.

618
00:42:50,669 --> 00:42:52,762
Hello.

619
00:42:53,405 --> 00:42:56,704
Hello, ladies and gentlemen.
I call you ladies and gentlemen.

620
00:42:56,875 --> 00:42:59,571
You know what you are.

621
00:43:00,912 --> 00:43:04,370
I know you're out there.
I can hear you breathing.

622
00:43:04,549 --> 00:43:05,914
Stop that!

623
00:43:06,084 --> 00:43:10,885
You're not supposed to laugh at me.
I'm not Bill Miller. He sings like a bird.

624
00:43:11,056 --> 00:43:13,581
I sing like a bird too, a vulture.

625
00:43:13,759 --> 00:43:16,159
I said, stop it.
You're not supposed to laugh at me.

626
00:43:16,328 --> 00:43:18,523
I only came out here to tell you
what Bill Miller does.

627
00:43:18,697 --> 00:43:19,959
He tells a lot of funny jokes,

628
00:43:20,132 --> 00:43:23,397
like the one about living over at
the hotel. He has a beautiful room.

629
00:43:23,568 --> 00:43:25,832
I have one too,
that overlooks the park.

630
00:43:26,004 --> 00:43:28,268
As a matter of fact,
it overlooks it completely.

631
00:43:31,143 --> 00:43:34,510
It's a lot like from where
I come from, in Brooklyn.

632
00:43:34,679 --> 00:43:36,738
I come from a very tough
neighborhood in Brooklyn.

633
00:43:36,915 --> 00:43:38,815
I was sort of head of the block.

634
00:43:38,984 --> 00:43:41,043
Yeah, they all called me "Blockhead".

635
00:43:45,023 --> 00:43:48,459
Would you like to hear me
sing a song?

636
00:43:50,662 --> 00:43:53,722
Would you please play
some music for me?

637
00:43:57,536 --> 00:43:58,798
Wait a minute.

638
00:44:00,072 --> 00:44:03,667
Hey, you. Where do you think
you're going, mister? Sit down, there.

639
00:44:03,842 --> 00:44:05,639
- You can't walk out of here.
- But I have...

640
00:44:05,811 --> 00:44:08,974
No, you can't walk out on Bill Miller's
act, even when he isn't acting.

641
00:44:09,147 --> 00:44:11,138
What do you want to do,
give us a bad name? Sit down.

642
00:44:11,316 --> 00:44:15,309
- But I have to...
- Oh, I don't care. You sit down there.

643
00:44:18,457 --> 00:44:20,152
There too. Now, you stay there,

644
00:44:20,325 --> 00:44:24,091
and nobody else try and walk out of
the theater, while I sing for Bill Miller.

645
00:44:24,262 --> 00:44:25,752
Where's my accordion?

646
00:44:25,931 --> 00:44:28,798
Don't shush, quiet me.
I've got to go on there.

647
00:44:28,967 --> 00:44:31,299
You're on now, and doing great.

648
00:44:31,903 --> 00:44:33,666
What?

649
00:44:35,874 --> 00:44:40,777
<i>Every little breeze</i>
<i>Seems to whisper "Louise"</i>

650
00:44:40,946 --> 00:44:45,645
<i>Birds in the trees seem</i>
<i>To twitter "Louise"</i>

651
00:44:45,817 --> 00:44:50,151
<i>Each little rose</i>
<i>Tells me it knows</i>

652
00:44:50,322 --> 00:44:52,790
<i>I love you</i>

653
00:44:53,992 --> 00:44:55,960
<i>Love you</i>

654
00:44:56,128 --> 00:45:00,724
<i>Every little beat</i>
<i>That I feel in my heart</i>

655
00:45:00,899 --> 00:45:06,166
<i>Seems to repeat</i>
<i>What I felt from the start</i>

656
00:45:06,338 --> 00:45:08,306
<i>Each little sigh</i>

657
00:45:08,473 --> 00:45:11,033
<i>Tells me that I</i>

658
00:45:11,209 --> 00:45:15,236
<i>Adore you, Louise</i>

659
00:45:16,014 --> 00:45:20,110
<i>Just to see and hear you</i>

660
00:45:20,285 --> 00:45:23,948
<i>Brings joy I never knew</i>

661
00:45:28,393 --> 00:45:33,023
<i>But to be so near you</i>

662
00:45:33,331 --> 00:45:37,563
<i>Thrills me through and through</i>

663
00:45:38,336 --> 00:45:43,330
<i>Anyone can see</i>
<i>Why I wanted your kiss</i>

664
00:45:43,508 --> 00:45:45,999
<i>It had to be</i>

665
00:45:46,178 --> 00:45:49,579
<i>But the wonder is this</i>

666
00:45:49,948 --> 00:45:52,610
<i>Can it be true</i>

667
00:45:52,951 --> 00:45:56,216
<i>Someone like you</i>

668
00:45:56,388 --> 00:46:01,587
<i>Someone like you</i>
<i>Could love me</i>

669
00:46:02,127 --> 00:46:04,687
<i>Louise? </i>

670
00:46:04,863 --> 00:46:07,957
<i>Louise! </i>

671
00:46:13,738 --> 00:46:15,467
- Where's Bill?
- Bill's OK.

672
00:46:16,841 --> 00:46:19,435
- Smoke?
- No, thanks. They make me cough

673
00:46:19,611 --> 00:46:22,409
- Even when I look at them.
- Say, you're a pretty funny fellow.

674
00:46:22,581 --> 00:46:24,515
- What's your name?
- Rogers. Ted Rogers.

675
00:46:24,683 --> 00:46:26,674
I've been wondering.
I didn't see you billed anywhere.

676
00:46:26,851 --> 00:46:28,978
- Oh, I don't care.
- You make the act.

677
00:46:29,154 --> 00:46:31,384
- How much does he pay you a week?
- Enough.

678
00:46:31,556 --> 00:46:33,751
Does he get plastered
like this very often?

679
00:46:33,925 --> 00:46:36,860
He never gets plastered,
and he ain't plastered now.

680
00:46:37,028 --> 00:46:40,464
Boy, you sure are touchy.
I'm just trying to pay you a compliment.

681
00:46:40,632 --> 00:46:44,261
I figured that sometime if you ever get
tired of no dough and no billing,

682
00:46:44,436 --> 00:46:45,903
- You can always...
- Now, wait a minute, Mr. Heinz,

683
00:46:46,071 --> 00:46:47,663
you can't say anything
against Bill Miller.

684
00:46:47,839 --> 00:46:51,297
He took me out of a stockroom, see?
I was only getting $15 a week, see?

685
00:46:51,476 --> 00:46:54,445
- But I'm only trying to...
- And now I'm getting $40, see?

686
00:46:57,949 --> 00:47:00,543
- How are you, Bill?
- Get your hands away from me.

687
00:47:00,719 --> 00:47:03,313
You know where you're going?
You're going back to Brooklyn.

688
00:47:03,488 --> 00:47:06,616
That's where you're going.
Back to Brooklyn.

689
00:47:07,559 --> 00:47:09,959
- Take it easy, Bill.
- Get your hands away from me.

690
00:47:10,128 --> 00:47:12,255
I know what I'm doing.

691
00:47:13,431 --> 00:47:15,331
Take it easy.

692
00:47:25,777 --> 00:47:27,642
He's resting.

693
00:47:28,013 --> 00:47:29,844
Boy, can he use it.

694
00:47:30,749 --> 00:47:33,411
Do you think we should call
a doctor or something?

695
00:47:33,585 --> 00:47:36,816
Why not use a blotter? I'll call a cab.

696
00:47:36,988 --> 00:47:39,582
Thanks. Mr. Winston...

697
00:47:39,924 --> 00:47:42,518
...you won't tell anybody...

698
00:47:42,994 --> 00:47:44,484
...that he was sick, will you?

699
00:47:44,663 --> 00:47:47,359
Don't worry, I've had actors
getting sick on me before.

700
00:47:47,532 --> 00:47:48,897
- Thanks.
- Thank you.

701
00:47:49,067 --> 00:47:51,126
Good thing you went out there.

702
00:47:51,303 --> 00:47:54,170
You sure you never did
a single before?

703
00:47:54,939 --> 00:47:57,464
I never did nothing before...

704
00:47:58,043 --> 00:48:00,511
...and I'm never gonna
do nothing again.

705
00:48:11,423 --> 00:48:14,017
Just a minute.
Just a minute, buddy.

706
00:48:14,192 --> 00:48:16,888
What do you think you're doing?

707
00:48:23,268 --> 00:48:27,329
Just a second, buddy.
What do you think you're doing...?

708
00:48:30,709 --> 00:48:33,735
Well, shut up.
I'm having enough trouble.

709
00:48:34,245 --> 00:48:36,907
Hello. Hello. Who?

710
00:48:37,082 --> 00:48:42,315
- <i>I feel like a feather in the breeze</i>
- No, he isn't in. Wait just a minute.

711
00:48:46,491 --> 00:48:49,051
Hello? Mary?

712
00:48:49,227 --> 00:48:51,320
Hello, how are you?

713
00:48:52,097 --> 00:48:55,328
Just a minute. Just a minute.

714
00:49:04,442 --> 00:49:07,275
Hello, Mary, how are you?
This is Ted.

715
00:49:07,445 --> 00:49:10,414
Hello, Ted. Fine, thanks.
Say, I've bean reading about you.

716
00:49:10,582 --> 00:49:12,880
Oh, yeah.

717
00:49:13,051 --> 00:49:16,612
- Is Bill there?
- Bill? Oh, he's fine.

718
00:49:16,988 --> 00:49:19,821
- Is he out?
- Is he out?

719
00:49:21,960 --> 00:49:24,155
Yeah, he's out.

720
00:49:24,329 --> 00:49:30,029
Oh, I mean, he's out playing a benefit,
Mary, for some society.

721
00:49:30,268 --> 00:49:32,259
Yeah, he's fine.

722
00:49:33,004 --> 00:49:34,869
All right, I'll tell him.

723
00:49:35,039 --> 00:49:39,271
All right, Mary. Bye.
Good night.

724
00:49:59,464 --> 00:50:03,264
"Sensational. Bill Miller,
exclusive management, Leo Lyman."

725
00:50:03,435 --> 00:50:08,099
That's a beautiful ad,
and the picture looks just like you.

726
00:50:10,375 --> 00:50:12,502
What did Mary say last night?

727
00:50:12,844 --> 00:50:16,405
Oh, nothing. I mean, she just wanted
to know how you were,

728
00:50:16,581 --> 00:50:18,606
et cetera, and so forth.

729
00:50:18,783 --> 00:50:21,183
- What did you say?
- I said that you hadn't come in yet,

730
00:50:21,352 --> 00:50:23,479
that you were playing a benefit.

731
00:50:23,655 --> 00:50:26,089
Oh, you mean you covered for me?

732
00:50:27,459 --> 00:50:30,087
I hope I didn't say the wrong thing.

733
00:50:30,261 --> 00:50:33,355
- Wrong thing?
- You're not mad?

734
00:50:33,531 --> 00:50:37,262
- No, I'm not mad. Thanks.
- We're friends?

735
00:50:37,435 --> 00:50:39,903
We're friends.

736
00:50:41,473 --> 00:50:44,033
- Get that, will you, kid?
- Yeah.

737
00:50:44,209 --> 00:50:47,975
- What happened?
- My leg fell asleep.

738
00:50:50,515 --> 00:50:52,415
- Hello.
- Surprise.

739
00:50:52,584 --> 00:50:53,881
Well, Leo, what's the good word?

740
00:50:54,052 --> 00:50:55,644
I was gonna send you a wire
but I figured it would be better

741
00:50:55,820 --> 00:50:58,254
if I came down myself to Pittsburgh
to tell you the good news.

742
00:50:58,423 --> 00:51:00,152
You know, you're not the only
one that's a ham.

743
00:51:00,325 --> 00:51:02,088
The Palace, New York.

744
00:51:02,260 --> 00:51:04,194
That's right. Next Thursday.

745
00:51:04,362 --> 00:51:07,354
Oh, boy, now my mother can come
and see me for free.

746
00:51:08,733 --> 00:51:11,065
Oh, yes, there's another thing,
in case you're forgetting it.

747
00:51:11,236 --> 00:51:15,536
- Thursday is also Mary's birthday.
- That's right.

748
00:51:15,707 --> 00:51:18,039
What other agent could arrange
for things like that?

749
00:51:18,343 --> 00:51:20,903
How did you arrange to have
Mary born on Thursday?

750
00:51:25,350 --> 00:51:26,977
Give me the coat.

751
00:51:27,151 --> 00:51:29,984
- Let go. Let go.
- I'm not touching it.

752
00:51:30,154 --> 00:51:32,213
Are you crazy?
You sewed it to the jacket.

753
00:51:32,390 --> 00:51:34,881
I'm sorry, Mr. Miller.
It'll only take a second.

754
00:51:36,160 --> 00:51:38,924
I'm sure glad you reminded me
of Mary's birthday.

755
00:51:39,097 --> 00:51:40,496
Yeah.

756
00:51:41,966 --> 00:51:46,369
Listen, kid, when you get that button
straight, send this off to Mary.

757
00:51:47,105 --> 00:51:49,938
- And send some roses too.
- Yes, sir.

758
00:51:50,808 --> 00:51:54,369
Leo, let's get some coffee
and talk money.

759
00:51:54,546 --> 00:51:57,640
How could you find a subject
so close to my heart?

760
00:52:02,253 --> 00:52:06,656
"Mrs. Bill Miller, 115 East 54th Street,
New York, New York.

761
00:52:06,824 --> 00:52:12,091
"Home for your birthday.
Big surprise. Bill."

762
00:52:19,337 --> 00:52:22,795
"Darling Mary.

763
00:52:23,041 --> 00:52:26,602
"Home for your birthday.
Big surprise.

764
00:52:26,911 --> 00:52:30,438
"I love you. Bill.

765
00:52:32,717 --> 00:52:34,651
"P.S.

766
00:52:35,353 --> 00:52:38,516
"Love from the kid."

767
00:52:45,330 --> 00:52:47,696
All right, open your eyes.
Happy birthday.

768
00:52:47,865 --> 00:52:51,130
Oh, Bill, what a wonderful present.
You're playing the Palace.

769
00:52:51,302 --> 00:52:53,930
- I'm so proud of you.
- And they said I couldn't do a single.

770
00:52:54,105 --> 00:52:56,630
Well, there you are.
Oh, by the way, honey,

771
00:52:56,808 --> 00:52:58,799
I want you to have
a big birthday party tonight.

772
00:52:58,977 --> 00:53:02,469
Invite all the guys that said I couldn't
make it, and some of your friends.

773
00:53:03,147 --> 00:53:05,809
- How about that?
- That's fine, just fine.

774
00:53:05,984 --> 00:53:10,250
Oh, and I have something else, Mary.
I wrote a song for you on the train.

775
00:53:10,622 --> 00:53:12,715
I wrote the words.
Bill wrote the music.

776
00:53:13,558 --> 00:53:17,426
"A Girl Named Mary".
Why, thank you, Ted. I know I'll love it.

777
00:53:17,595 --> 00:53:19,586
Come on, let's go, Mary.

778
00:53:20,365 --> 00:53:23,334
- Oh, yes.
- Come on, kid.

779
00:53:23,501 --> 00:53:24,490
- William.
- Well, Ben.

780
00:53:24,669 --> 00:53:25,829
- Hello, Mary.
- Hello, Ben.

781
00:53:26,004 --> 00:53:27,995
- What are you doing here?
- Here's where I lost you.

782
00:53:28,172 --> 00:53:30,470
Here's where I pick you up again.
Hello, Ted.

783
00:53:30,642 --> 00:53:33,270
You've developed into
quite an actor.

784
00:53:33,911 --> 00:53:36,641
Look, Mary, I'm going back to take
a look at my dressing room.

785
00:53:36,814 --> 00:53:38,406
- Now, you stay here with Ben.
- All right.

786
00:53:38,583 --> 00:53:41,552
When I come back, I'll buy you lunch.
Come on, kid.

787
00:53:44,756 --> 00:53:46,451
Wanna tell Uncle Ben?

788
00:53:46,624 --> 00:53:50,458
Well, don't you think he should have
Ted's name around here somewhere?

789
00:53:50,628 --> 00:53:53,825
Well, you know, I've got a sneaking
feeling he's saving that grand gesture

790
00:53:53,998 --> 00:53:55,465
until he's a big hit
here at the Palace.

791
00:53:55,633 --> 00:53:58,261
- You really think so?
- Sure.

792
00:54:01,039 --> 00:54:03,803
Yeah, this looks all right.
Put the stuff here.

793
00:54:03,975 --> 00:54:05,772
Now, get some lunch
and I'll see you later, kid.

794
00:54:05,943 --> 00:54:07,501
Thank you.

795
00:54:13,985 --> 00:54:15,247
Come in.

796
00:54:19,323 --> 00:54:21,985
- Oh...
- Hello, handsome.

797
00:54:22,160 --> 00:54:24,185
Gee, I'm glad you made good.

798
00:54:24,362 --> 00:54:28,526
- Is that so?
- Sure. I've been following your tour.

799
00:54:30,334 --> 00:54:34,464
- What for?
- Because I think you're cute.

800
00:54:35,440 --> 00:54:38,136
Why isn't your picture in the lobby?

801
00:54:39,410 --> 00:54:42,743
You're pretty fresh, ain't you?
How did you get in here?

802
00:54:42,914 --> 00:54:45,348
I told the doorman I was your girl.

803
00:54:45,516 --> 00:54:48,144
My girl. What are you trying to do,
ruin me? You get out of here.

804
00:54:48,319 --> 00:54:50,787
It ain't right for you to be
in my dressing room.

805
00:54:50,955 --> 00:54:53,321
I mean, Mr. Miller's dressing room.

806
00:54:53,558 --> 00:54:55,685
OK, I'm going.

807
00:54:56,227 --> 00:55:00,755
But when you start thinking about girls,
I want you to think about me.

808
00:55:00,932 --> 00:55:03,958
- I ain't gonna think about girls.
- You shave, don't you?

809
00:55:04,135 --> 00:55:05,830
Yeah, I started to shave.

810
00:55:06,003 --> 00:55:08,130
You'll be thinking about them.

811
00:55:08,306 --> 00:55:09,967
So long.

812
00:55:17,448 --> 00:55:21,714
<i>Hello, handsome. Hello, handsome. </i>

813
00:55:21,886 --> 00:55:26,323
<i>Hello, handsome. Hello, handsome. </i>

814
00:56:17,708 --> 00:56:20,438
Come with me to the Casbah.

815
00:56:22,513 --> 00:56:25,778
Come with me to the Casbah.

816
00:56:39,964 --> 00:56:43,730
"Hi, cutie, in case you want to return
this handbag,

817

- Hey, wait a minute!
- What is it?

827
00:57:36,387 --> 00:57:37,820
Don't you want your soda?

828
00:57:37,989 --> 00:57:40,457
This is a very funny way for a lady
to try and meet a fellow,

829
00:57:40,625 --> 00:57:42,616
leave her purse on the seat
and then come next door...

830
00:57:42,793 --> 00:57:45,023
Well, I just wanted to meet you.

831
00:57:45,196 --> 00:57:48,165
Well, why don't you get
yourself introduced?

832
00:57:48,399 --> 00:57:49,627
Oh, excuse me.

833
00:57:49,967 --> 00:57:52,458
My name's Jennie Tait
and this fellow's name is...

834
00:57:52,637 --> 00:57:54,229
What did you say your name was?

835
00:57:54,405 --> 00:57:55,702
Ted Rogers.

836
00:57:55,873 --> 00:57:58,364
Would you please introduce us?

837
00:58:00,544 --> 00:58:02,774
- Mr. Rogers?
- Yeah?

838
00:58:02,980 --> 00:58:05,608
May I present Miss Genevieve Tait.

839
00:58:05,816 --> 00:58:07,750
Pleased to meet you.

840
00:58:08,119 --> 00:58:10,451
Now, will you have your soda?

841
00:58:14,725 --> 00:58:17,057
How did you know I like chocolate?

842
00:58:18,930 --> 00:58:22,229
Did anyone ever tell you
you're adorable?

843
00:58:22,733 --> 00:58:24,223
No.

844
00:58:24,402 --> 00:58:26,302
Well, you are.

845
00:58:27,405 --> 00:58:30,966
You might not believe this,
but I was a very ugly child.

846
00:58:55,633 --> 00:58:59,467
Stop looking at the watch, Mary.
He'll be here.

847
00:59:03,040 --> 00:59:04,302
Look at the kid.

848
00:59:13,250 --> 00:59:15,616
Oh, Frecklehead... I mean, Miss Tait,

849
00:59:15,786 --> 00:59:18,254
this is Mrs. Miller
and this is Mr. Lyman.

850
00:59:18,422 --> 00:59:19,787
Hello.

851
00:59:19,957 --> 00:59:21,822
- Did I do it all right?
- You certainly did.

852
00:59:21,993 --> 00:59:24,223
- Happy to know you, Miss Tait.
- Hello.

853
00:59:24,395 --> 00:59:25,885
Her name is really Genevieve,

854
00:59:26,063 --> 00:59:28,361
but I think it best we all call her
Frecklehead.

855
00:59:28,532 --> 00:59:29,931
- OK, Frecklehead.
- Frecklehead.

856
00:59:30,101 --> 00:59:31,898
Is it all right that I brought her
to the party?

857
00:59:32,069 --> 00:59:33,661
Of course. I'm delighted to have her.

858
00:59:33,838 --> 00:59:37,274
I'm glad of that, Mrs. Miller.
Congratulations on your birthday.

859
00:59:37,441 --> 00:59:39,375
Why, thank you. Have a nice time.

860
00:59:39,543 --> 00:59:41,511
Thank you, we will.

861
00:59:42,480 --> 00:59:45,745
Genevieve... Frecklehead.

862
00:59:47,251 --> 00:59:50,345
- Gee, she's nice.
- And pretty.

863
00:59:50,521 --> 00:59:52,421
You're pretty too.

864
00:59:52,623 --> 00:59:56,525
- Did you always have freckles?
- Yes, and I hate them.

865
00:59:56,827 --> 00:59:58,818
I think they're very becoming.

866
00:59:59,030 --> 01:00:01,658
It just goes to show what you know.

867
01:00:01,932 --> 01:00:04,366
What do you wanna do,
start something?

868
01:00:10,074 --> 01:00:12,133
I'm sorry, Leo.

869
01:00:16,080 --> 01:00:18,241
You know he wouldn't stay away
unless it was someone

870
01:00:18,416 --> 01:00:20,611
or something very important, Mary.

871
01:00:20,785 --> 01:00:23,811
It's always someone or something.

872
01:00:23,988 --> 01:00:28,823
Leo, you've known him for so long.
Why is he so thoughtless of everyone?

873
01:00:29,126 --> 01:00:30,889
He's just going through
a stage now, Mary.

874
01:00:31,062 --> 01:00:32,757
He just hit "OI' Man River" success,

875
01:00:32,930 --> 01:00:34,955
and maybe the water's a little bit
too deep for him.

876
01:00:35,132 --> 01:00:37,259
But don't worry.
They all come ashore.

877
01:00:37,768 --> 01:00:40,669
I know this is just ambition.

878
01:00:40,838 --> 01:00:44,774
Down deep inside,
there's a wonderful, sweet guy.

879
01:00:44,975 --> 01:00:48,968
I found it once
and I'll bring it out again.

880
01:00:49,146 --> 01:00:51,637
Oh, I'm sorry. Let's have a drink.

881
01:00:52,783 --> 01:00:54,080
To Mary and Bill.

882
01:00:55,286 --> 01:00:57,277
He wouldn't like the billing.

883
01:01:02,960 --> 01:01:05,053
This is where I live.

884
01:01:15,306 --> 01:01:17,001
Well...

885
01:01:17,775 --> 01:01:19,743
...good night.

886
01:01:20,444 --> 01:01:23,311
I had a wonderful time.

887
01:01:23,481 --> 01:01:26,473
Well, good night. I'll see you.

888
01:01:26,650 --> 01:01:28,015
I hope so.

889
01:01:28,185 --> 01:01:30,210
Thanks for everything.

890
01:01:30,387 --> 01:01:32,287
That's all right.

891
01:01:32,857 --> 01:01:35,826
Frecklehead, you know I...

892
01:01:36,060 --> 01:01:38,153
- I wonder...
- Yes?

893
01:01:39,196 --> 01:01:41,562
Well, I never kissed
a girl before, and...

894
01:01:42,032 --> 01:01:44,227
- Well...
- You never what?

895
01:01:45,402 --> 01:01:48,200
You heard me. I never kissed a girl
before in my whole life.

896
01:01:48,372 --> 01:01:51,773
- You're sure?
- Sure, I'm sure.

897
01:01:52,576 --> 01:01:54,976
- Never mind.
- Just a minute.

898
01:02:03,754 --> 01:02:07,781
- I'm never gonna do that again.
- Did it do something to you?

899
01:02:07,958 --> 01:02:11,325
It had no effect on me whatsoever.

900
01:02:36,215 --> 01:02:37,773
Mary.

901
01:02:39,051 --> 01:02:40,541
Mary.

902
01:02:40,920 --> 01:02:43,411
I'm sorry I missed the party, honey,
but I couldn't help it.

903
01:02:46,359 --> 01:02:48,452
Oh, Mary, please don't cry.

904
01:02:48,627 --> 01:02:51,528
I love you, honey. Honest, I do.

905
01:02:51,697 --> 01:02:55,098
But I was so excited. I want to tell you
about Sutherland and everything.

906
01:02:55,267 --> 01:02:58,862
I don't care about you
or Sutherland or anyone.

907
01:02:59,038 --> 01:03:03,441
But he wants me in the revue, honey.
He gave me a contract to look over.

908
01:03:03,743 --> 01:03:06,576
Here, look under the door.
I'll show it to you.

909
01:03:14,687 --> 01:03:17,520
- OK.
- What's the matter?

910
01:03:17,723 --> 01:03:19,122
She locked me out.

911
01:03:19,291 --> 01:03:21,782
Really? Is that legal?

912
01:03:21,961 --> 01:03:25,226
I'm sorry. You don't have to get sore.
I was just asking.

913
01:03:26,899 --> 01:03:29,595
You know, you may not think that
in this head anything can happen,

914
01:03:29,769 --> 01:03:32,795
but it can. I got an idea. Listen.

915
01:03:37,810 --> 01:03:39,675
- You got it?
- Yeah.

916
01:03:42,848 --> 01:03:44,543
I'm sorry.

917
01:03:46,752 --> 01:03:48,014
And now, ladies and gentlemen,

918
01:03:48,187 --> 01:03:50,280
a new song written by
two very talented boys,

919
01:03:50,456 --> 01:03:53,653
especially for the birthday
of Mrs. Bill Miller.

920
01:03:57,196 --> 01:04:01,223
<i>The world looks rosy</i>

01:04:01,400 --> 01:04:04,597
<i>Up on Sweetheart Hill</i>

922
01:04:06,105 --> 01:04:09,836
<i>For a girl named Mary</i>

01:04:10,876 --> 01:04:13,367
<i>And a boy named Bill</i>

<i>And a boy named Bill</i>

928
01:04:33,065 --> 01:04:38,526
<i>Where there's a sky</i>
<i>That's full of moonlight</i>

929
01:04:38,704 --> 01:04:42,435
<i>And a Mary full of charms</i>

930
01:04:43,175 --> 01:04:47,805
<i>There ought to be a William</i>

931
01:04:48,481 --> 01:04:50,847
<i>Snuggled in her arms</i>

932
01:04:51,016 --> 01:04:54,110
<i>So if I kiss you</i>

933
01:04:55,421 --> 01:04:58,652
<i>And I think I will</i>

934
01:05:00,192 --> 01:05:04,788
<i>Believe me, it's the only thing</i>

935
01:05:05,764 --> 01:05:08,198
<i>To do</i>

936
01:05:09,034 --> 01:05:13,061
<i>For you're my Mary</i>

937
01:05:13,706 --> 01:05:16,402
<i>And I'm your Bill</i>

938
01:05:18,310 --> 01:05:22,269
<i>And it's wonderful</i>

939
01:05:22,448 --> 01:05:28,785
<i>To be in love with you</i>

940
01:05:41,400 --> 01:05:43,334
Oh, Bill.

941
01:05:43,536 --> 01:05:45,561
Mrs. Miller, we're going out
and celebrating.

942
01:05:45,738 --> 01:05:47,933
- At this hour?
- Sure. I'll find a club open

943
01:05:48,107 --> 01:05:49,938
- Or I'll open one.
- Now, what would people say?

944
01:05:50,109 --> 01:05:53,306
A big star seen out in public
with his own wife. It's too normal.

945
01:05:53,479 --> 01:05:56,141
We'll take Ted along
as a chaperone.

946
01:06:03,689 --> 01:06:06,783
Oh, I can't help it, it's so romantic.

947
01:06:16,435 --> 01:06:18,232
Waiter, some more
champagne, please.

948
01:06:18,404 --> 01:06:19,666
Yes, sir.

949
01:06:20,606 --> 01:06:22,301
Excuse me.

950
01:06:22,508 --> 01:06:25,841
- Don't you think Ted's had enough?
- He's all right.

951
01:06:26,045 --> 01:06:29,481
- Are you whispering about me?
- Oh, no. What gives you that idea?

952
01:06:29,648 --> 01:06:33,345
I don't know.
Am I being very extraordinary?

953
01:06:33,519 --> 01:06:36,511
"Hextraordinary", that's a funny one.

954
01:06:37,089 --> 01:06:38,249
How do you feel?

955
01:06:40,960 --> 01:06:42,894
I feel very...

956
01:06:43,162 --> 01:06:45,027
...glingglong, thank you.

957
01:06:45,197 --> 01:06:46,221
Glingglong?

958
01:06:50,903 --> 01:06:53,599
Thank you, thank you very much.
Good evening, ladies and gentlemen.

959
01:06:54,240 --> 01:06:55,298
We don't usually do this,

960
01:06:55,474 --> 01:06:58,034
but there's a young man
here I'd like to have you meet.

961
01:06:58,210 --> 01:07:01,702
He's just scored a terrific hit
at the Palace Theatre. Mr. Bill Miller!

962
01:07:03,415 --> 01:07:06,282
Thank you.
Excuse me, will you, honey?

963
01:07:08,821 --> 01:07:10,049
Thank you, Tommy.

964
01:07:10,222 --> 01:07:13,316
Ladies and gentlemen, thank you,
but this isn't my night at all.

965
01:07:13,492 --> 01:07:16,689
We have a young lady in the audience
who's celebrating her birthday.

966
01:07:16,996 --> 01:07:18,964
And by a very strange coincidence,

967
01:07:19,131 --> 01:07:21,497
I have written a new song,
especially for her.

968
01:07:21,700 --> 01:07:24,032
And maybe we can get her up here
to sing this song.

969
01:07:25,404 --> 01:07:27,929
She happens to be my wife,
and also the great

970
01:07:28,107 --> 01:07:31,702
Sutherland Revue star,
Miss Mary Turner.

971
01:07:34,947 --> 01:07:38,508
- Hiya, Big Shot.
- Hiya, Heinz.

972
01:07:38,684 --> 01:07:40,413
Pardon me.

973
01:07:44,990 --> 01:07:47,618
Mary, you say something sensational
to the people

974
01:07:47,793 --> 01:07:49,852
and I'll talk with the piano player.

975
01:07:50,296 --> 01:07:52,958
Thank you. It's very gracious
of my husband

976
01:07:53,132 --> 01:07:58,069
to ask me to sing a song, particularly
this song, "A Girl Named Mary".

977
01:07:58,237 --> 01:08:03,197
Music by Bill Miller,
words by Ted Rogers.

978
01:08:08,647 --> 01:08:12,413

985
01:08:31,870 --> 01:08:35,636

- <i>My, what a most peculiar sky</i>

986
01:08:35,808 --> 01:08:39,403
- <i>And a boy named Bill</i>
- <i>Pardon me, did you drop a sigh? </i>

987
01:08:39,578 --> 01:08:44,106
<i>Where there's a sky</i>
<i>That's full of moonlight</i>

<i>There really ought to be a William</i>

- <i>Right! </i>
- <i>Snuggled in her arms</i>

991
01:08:55,094 --> 01:08:58,530
- <i>So if I kiss you</i>
- <i>What makes you think you won't? </i>

992
01:08:58,764 --> 01:09:02,495
- <i>And I think that I will</i>
- <i>You're crazy if you don't</i>

993
01:09:02,701 --> 01:09:08,401
<i>Believe me, it's the only thing to do</i>

994
01:09:08,574 --> 01:09:10,667
<i>So true</i>

995
01:09:10,843 --> 01:09:13,937
<i>For you're my Mary</i>

996
01:09:14,113 --> 01:09:16,308
<i>And you're my Bill</i>

997
01:09:16,482 --> 01:09:18,245
<i>Your Bill</i>

998
01:09:18,417 --> 01:09:24,356
<i>And it's wonderful</i>
<i>To be in love with you</i>

999
01:09:32,264 --> 01:09:34,391
Hello, Heinz.

1000
01:09:34,566 --> 01:09:37,296
Oh, you'd better not drink any more.

1001
01:09:37,770 --> 01:09:42,935
If I want to celebrate for my pal Bill,
I can celebrate.

1002
01:09:43,375 --> 01:09:45,240
This is for your own good.

1003
01:09:45,411 --> 01:09:49,074
Come over here with me.
I want to tell you something, alone.

1004
01:09:49,248 --> 01:09:51,773
Come on, come on, come on.

1005

<i>Believe me, it's the only thing do</i>

- <i>Mary, yes</i>

01:10:04,663 --> 01:10:07,723
<i>And you're my Bill</i>

1008
01:10:17,309 --> 01:10:23,475
<i>And it's wonderful</i>

<i>With you</i>

1011
01:10:40,866 --> 01:10:42,595
- Where's Ted?
- I don't know.

1012
01:10:44,436 --> 01:10:46,461
Look, get smart, will you, kid?

1013
01:10:46,638 --> 01:10:50,267
If anything happens to you, your pal
Bill, he's gonna starve to death.

1014
01:10:50,442 --> 01:10:54,139
Why, he's nothing but a third-rate,
broken-down ham.

1015
01:10:59,318 --> 01:11:01,286
Hey, what happened?

1016
01:11:07,426 --> 01:11:09,087
Are you all right, kid?

1017
01:11:09,261 --> 01:11:11,695
- Yeah.
- You sure?

1018
01:11:11,897 --> 01:11:13,922
He never touched me.

1019
01:11:22,407 --> 01:11:26,104
I took care of him pretty good.

1020
01:11:26,278 --> 01:11:27,973
You were wonderful.

1021
01:11:28,146 --> 01:11:31,877
Yeah, but I had to hold back a little.
I didn't want to hurt him too bad.

1022
01:11:32,050 --> 01:11:34,245
- Sure, sure.
- Here, off with the coat.

1023
01:11:34,419 --> 01:11:35,784
- Come on.
- Off with the coat.

1024

<i>A girl named Mary</i>
<i>Is not contrary</i>

1025
01:11:40,392 --> 01:11:43,054
- I'll turn the covers down.
- She'll turn the covers down.

1026
01:11:43,228 --> 01:11:48,131
- You'll go right to bed.
- Bed? What's playing there?

1027
01:11:50,435 --> 01:11:52,926
You think I'm drunk.

1028
01:11:53,605 --> 01:11:56,631
Well, as they say in the Klondike,

1029
01:11:56,909 --> 01:12:00,606
- "Fara-a-lito-garn-a-lendo."
- Garn-a-lendo.

1030
01:12:00,779 --> 01:12:02,838
You know what that means?

1031
01:12:03,949 --> 01:12:05,917
"Stinking drunk."

1032
01:12:07,619 --> 01:12:11,111
- So let's have a little drink.
- Oh, no, oh, no. You're going to bed.

1033
01:12:11,290 --> 01:12:12,917
- Going to bed?
- Sure, you're going to bed.

1034
01:12:13,091 --> 01:12:14,149
I don't know anybody in bed.

1035
01:12:14,326 --> 01:12:16,089
- Here we go.
- Here we go.

- Here we go.
- Here we go.

1038
01:12:21,633 --> 01:12:24,568
- That's a wonderful song.
- Oh, a beautiful song.

1039
01:12:24,736 --> 01:12:27,296
<i>A boy named Mary</i>

Mary love Bill?

1045
01:12:43,822 --> 01:12:47,314
That's right.
Because I love the both of you.

1046
01:12:49,328 --> 01:12:51,353
Don't you believe me?

1047
01:12:51,530 --> 01:12:52,997
- Yeah.
- Yes.

1048
01:12:55,834 --> 01:12:57,995
Bill, you're the luckiest fellow
in the whole world

1049
01:12:58,170 --> 01:12:59,797
- Because Mary loves you.
- Yeah, I'm lucky.

1050
01:12:59,972 --> 01:13:02,873
If Mary loved me,
I wouldn't ever leave her.

1051

- I wouldn't either.
- Never leave her.

I'll never leave her.

1053

Even if I was on the stage,
I wouldn't ever leave her.

1054
01:13:10,282 --> 01:13:11,715
And I know that.

1055
01:13:11,883 --> 01:13:14,716
Because Mary's wonderful, Bill.

- Thank you, Ted.

01:14:22,020 --> 01:14:23,851
- No, here we go.
- Here we go.

1073
01:14:24,022 --> 01:14:26,456
- Come on, here we go. Wake up.
- Come on, here we go.

1074
01:14:26,625 --> 01:14:28,957
- Come on. Here we go.
- Here we go.

1075
01:14:29,127 --> 01:14:31,152
- All right, now, are you OK?
- Here we go.

1076
01:14:31,329 --> 01:14:34,821
OK. Ted. Here we go.
Come on, now.

1077
01:14:35,634 --> 01:14:37,067
- What's the matter?
- What's that?

1078
01:14:37,302 --> 01:14:39,270
Oh, that's your head. That's OK.

1079
01:14:39,438 --> 01:14:41,668
Now, stay right there. Hold it.

1080
01:14:41,840 --> 01:14:44,502
Here's some coffee. It'll fix you up.

1081
01:14:44,676 --> 01:14:47,076
Ted! Here we go, now! Come on, up.

1082
01:14:47,245 --> 01:14:51,011
- Upsy-daisy, here we go.
- Oh, my head!

1083
01:14:51,183 --> 01:14:52,775
That's mine.

1084
01:14:52,951 --> 01:14:55,249
Now, come on. I gotta see Sutherland
and I'm late now.

1085
01:14:55,420 --> 01:14:56,717
- Oh, who?
- Sutherland.

1086
01:14:56,922 --> 01:14:58,822
- Now, come on, let's go.
- All right.

1087
01:14:58,990 --> 01:15:01,390
- Are you all right? OK!
- OK.

1088
01:15:01,560 --> 01:15:03,551
- You sure you're all right?
- I'm sure I'm all right.

1089
01:15:03,729 --> 01:15:05,094
- You feel fine?
- I feel fine.

1090
01:15:05,263 --> 01:15:06,855
- You feel OK?
- I feel OK.

1091
01:15:07,032 --> 01:15:11,230
- All right.
- All right. I'm OK. I'm OK!

1092
01:15:20,879 --> 01:15:22,608
Sorry, gentlemen.

1093
01:15:22,814 --> 01:15:25,339
- Excuse me.
- Oh, excuse me, Mr. Sutherland.

1094
01:15:25,517 --> 01:15:26,848
It looks OK to me, Bill.

1095
01:15:27,018 --> 01:15:28,508
- OK?
- Yeah.

1096
01:15:34,092 --> 01:15:36,720
- Where do I sign?
- Right here.

1097
01:15:37,062 --> 01:15:39,690
Don't you want to read it first?
Check on your salary?

1098
01:15:39,865 --> 01:15:43,665
There'll be no checks.
I want all my money in cash.

1099
01:15:49,541 --> 01:15:51,475
I'm nervous.

1100
01:15:52,477 --> 01:15:55,275
- What's my name?
- Ted Rogers.

1101
01:15:55,447 --> 01:15:57,278
I forgot.

1102
01:16:00,318 --> 01:16:02,809
Excuse me, Mr. Sutherland,
but could I use your phone, please?

1103
01:16:02,988 --> 01:16:04,216
Certainly.

1104
01:16:04,389 --> 01:16:06,653
Thank you. Here.

1105
01:16:07,659 --> 01:16:08,648
Thanks.

1106
01:16:08,827 --> 01:16:14,231
Hello, operator, would you be good
enough to get me Greenpoint 7-99 70?

1107
01:16:16,034 --> 01:16:21,336
Hello, Ma! Hey, Ma, look at me.
I'm in Mr. Sutherland's Revue.

1108
01:16:21,840 --> 01:16:26,504
No! No, Ma, I'll keep my clothes on.

1109
01:16:30,482 --> 01:16:33,417
<i>And a boy named Bill</i>

1110
01:16:34,186 --> 01:16:36,746
- Well, hi.
- Hi. What's all the excitement?

1111
01:16:36,922 --> 01:16:40,449
Oh, I... What are you hiding?
What is that?

1112
01:16:40,625 --> 01:16:43,856
Oh, it's just a telegram
from C.B. Cochran in London.

1113
01:16:44,029 --> 01:16:45,621
He wants me to star
in his new revue,

1114
01:16:45,797 --> 01:16:47,628
just in case you think
I'm an old has-been.

1115
01:16:47,799 --> 01:16:50,791
Well, you tell Mr. Cochran
to go peddle his papers.

1116
01:16:50,969 --> 01:16:53,529
Happy day-after-your-birthday.

1117
01:16:56,007 --> 01:16:58,976
Oh, Bill!
This must have cost a fortune!

1118
01:16:59,144 --> 01:17:00,441
Well, you know
what everybody says:

1119
01:17:00,612 --> 01:17:03,581
"Money isn't everything,
and I'm the guy that keeps proving it."

1120
01:17:03,815 --> 01:17:06,079
You know something?
You've got your arms around a guy

1121
01:17:06,251 --> 01:17:07,878
who's gonna star
in Sutherland's Revue.

1122
01:17:08,053 --> 01:17:09,042
Really?

1123
01:17:09,221 --> 01:17:10,950
Signed, sealed and delivered
this afternoon.

1124
01:17:11,122 --> 01:17:12,248
- Ted too?
- Well, sure.

1125
01:17:12,424 --> 01:17:14,221
Everywhere I go, Ted goes too.

1126
01:17:14,392 --> 01:17:17,122
- I hope so.
- What do you mean, "I hope so"?

1127
01:17:17,329 --> 01:17:18,591
Well, I...

1128
01:17:18,797 --> 01:17:20,662
I thought after you opened
at the Palace

1129
01:17:20,832 --> 01:17:23,630
it would've been nice if you'd
given him some kind of recognition.

1130
01:17:23,802 --> 01:17:26,930
Look, honey, will you leave the kid
to me? I know how to handle him.

1131
01:17:27,105 --> 01:17:30,734
He's happy, I'm happy, you're happy.
We're a big hit.

1132
01:17:30,942 --> 01:17:33,308
I guarantee I'll always take care
of the kid.

1133
01:17:33,478 --> 01:17:36,538
You promise?
You won't ever treat him like a...

1134
01:17:36,715 --> 01:17:38,945
- Like a what?
- You know...

1135
01:17:39,517 --> 01:17:42,008
Like a nobody. A stooge.

1136
01:17:42,187 --> 01:17:43,882
I promise.

1137
01:17:45,156 --> 01:17:49,058
<i>A boy named Mary</i>
<i>And a girl named Bill</i>

1138
01:17:49,227 --> 01:17:50,558
- Hello.
- Hi.

1139
01:17:50,729 --> 01:17:51,753
Hello, Ted.

1140
01:17:51,930 --> 01:17:53,727
Listen, I wanted to
ask you something.

1141
01:17:53,899 --> 01:17:56,424
Since the both of you are practically
my mother and my father

1142
01:17:56,601 --> 01:17:58,626
and I wouldn't do a thing
without consulting you,

1143
01:17:58,803 --> 01:18:01,101
and after we open
and we're a big hit...

1144
01:18:01,273 --> 01:18:03,901
After we open and we're a big hit,
and after I'm married,

1145
01:18:04,075 --> 01:18:06,600
what should I do,
buy a house or rent an apartment?

1146
01:18:06,878 --> 01:18:08,869
Well, whom are you going to marry?

1147
01:18:09,781 --> 01:18:11,715
Whom am I going to marry?

1148
01:18:11,883 --> 01:18:14,374
I am going to marry
Miss Genevieve Tait.

1149
01:18:14,552 --> 01:18:16,782
Frecklehead, that's whom.

1150
01:18:16,955 --> 01:18:18,820
Well, I suggest you ask
Miss Frecklehead

1151
01:18:18,990 --> 01:18:21,390
whether she'd rather live
in a house or an apartment.

1152
01:18:21,559 --> 01:18:23,618
Oh, no, I have to disagree
with you there, Mary,

1153
01:18:23,795 --> 01:18:26,389
because I feel it is
the husband's place to decide.

1154
01:18:26,564 --> 01:18:28,464
She's gonna live there with you.

1155
01:18:28,967 --> 01:18:30,798
She is? I mean, she is.

1156
01:18:30,969 --> 01:18:32,266
- That's right.
- Yeah.

1157
01:18:32,637 --> 01:18:34,764
- Would you do me a favor, Mary?
- If I can.

1158
01:18:34,940 --> 01:18:36,407
The next time you see Frecklehead,

1159
01:18:36,574 --> 01:18:40,806
will you ask her to ask me
to ask her to marry her?

1160
01:18:40,979 --> 01:18:43,174
Because I'm gonna ask her.

1161
01:18:44,449 --> 01:18:47,543
- Well, I'll do my best.
- Gee, thanks, Mary. Bye.

1162
01:18:47,719 --> 01:18:49,516
My best too.

1163
01:18:57,562 --> 01:18:59,120
Freckle...

1164
01:18:59,564 --> 01:19:02,124
- Frecklehead?
- Yes?

1165
01:19:03,435 --> 01:19:06,836
- I wanted to ask you...
- Yes?

1166
01:19:07,005 --> 01:19:09,633
Well, I thought that maybe
you and me could...

1167
01:19:09,808 --> 01:19:11,366
Yes?

1168
01:19:11,943 --> 01:19:16,039
- I mean, if the two of us were...
- Yes?

1169
01:19:18,416 --> 01:19:19,940
Here.

1170
01:19:23,421 --> 01:19:24,854
How about it?

1171
01:19:25,023 --> 01:19:26,650
Not until you ask me.

1172
01:19:28,326 --> 01:19:31,295
Would you consider marrying
a fellow who sits up in a box?

1173
01:19:36,868 --> 01:19:39,598
Well, what are you bawling about?

1174
01:19:40,939 --> 01:19:42,998
Try it on.

1175
01:19:44,009 --> 01:19:45,306
Go ahead, try it on.

1176
01:19:45,477 --> 01:19:48,241
I'd love to marry you...

1177
01:19:48,813 --> 01:19:50,542
...but I gotta tell you something first.

1178
01:19:51,282 --> 01:19:53,307
Can't you tell me
after we're married?

1179
01:19:53,485 --> 01:19:56,045
No, it's very important.

1180
01:19:57,122 --> 01:19:58,555
I think you're a big dope

1181
01:19:58,757 --> 01:20:00,952
because you're letting Bill Miller
make a fool of you.

1182
01:20:01,126 --> 01:20:03,253
- Wait a minute!
- I won't wait a minute!

1183
01:20:03,428 --> 01:20:04,952
He's making a fool of you!

1184
01:20:05,130 --> 01:20:08,395
Frecklehead, Bill Miller is my friend.

1185
01:20:08,566 --> 01:20:11,296
And besides, whatever we do
is no business of yours!

1186
01:20:11,469 --> 01:20:13,869
If I'm gonna marry you,
it's a lot of my business!

1187
01:20:14,039 --> 01:20:16,234
Well, wait until
after we're married, then!

1188
01:20:17,475 --> 01:20:18,965
OK!

1189
01:20:19,978 --> 01:20:22,037
OK!

1190
01:20:36,260 --> 01:20:39,457
- Curtain going up.
- First aisle to the right.

1191
01:20:39,730 --> 01:20:41,823
- Curtain going up.
- Straight ahead, please.

1192
01:20:43,467 --> 01:20:45,298
First aisle to the right.

1193
01:20:45,937 --> 01:20:50,135
<i>Well, I'm happy, so happy</i>
<i>When you're near</i>

1194
01:20:50,308 --> 01:20:53,038
<i>My troubles just disappear</i>

1195
01:20:53,210 --> 01:20:56,873
<i>As soon as you're by my side</i>
<i>Well, I'm satisfied</i>

1196
01:20:57,048 --> 01:21:01,678
<i>I feel like a feather in the breeze</i>
<i>Having my fun, kissing the sun</i>

1197
01:21:01,852 --> 01:21:04,377
<i>And it's because you're the one</i>

1198
01:21:04,722 --> 01:21:07,589
<i>So I'm singing</i>
<i>Like the birdies in the trees</i>

01:21:07,758 --> 01:21:10,727
<i>And feeling like a feather</i>
<i>Feeling like a feather</i>

<i>Feeling like a feather in the breeze</i>

1201
01:21:22,106 --> 01:21:24,131
Thank you, ladies and gentlemen.
If there's any song you'd like to hear,

1202
01:21:24,308 --> 01:21:26,173
just call it out and I'd be glad
to do it for you.

1203
01:21:26,344 --> 01:21:28,471
- "Just One More Chance".
- What?

1204
01:21:28,646 --> 01:21:31,615
"Just One More Chance", and I'd like
to hear you play it on that zither.

1205
01:21:31,782 --> 01:21:34,478
"Thither"? This isn't a zither.

1206
01:21:34,652 --> 01:21:37,348
- No? Then what ith it?
- What ith it?

1207
01:21:37,755 --> 01:21:41,122
- Well, thith ithn't a thither.
- Yeth, what ith it?

1208
01:21:41,292 --> 01:21:44,557
Thith ith a... Thith ith...
Now he's got me doing it.

1209
01:21:44,795 --> 01:21:47,525
This is an Italian lavaliere.
This is a burden around my neck.

1210
01:21:47,698 --> 01:21:49,063
You know what a burden is,
don't you?

1211
01:21:49,533 --> 01:21:53,060
Sure. A bird in the hand
is worth two in the bush.

1212
01:21:53,704 --> 01:21:55,501
Ladies and gentlemen,
I'd like to sing a song...

1213
01:21:55,673 --> 01:21:57,163
- Thanks for the warning.
- Hear, hear.

1214
01:21:57,341 --> 01:22:00,936
I'll have you know that my aunt gave
me $10,000 to cultivate my voice.

1215
01:22:01,112 --> 01:22:02,409
Really?

1216
01:22:02,913 --> 01:22:07,350
- <i>Just one more chance</i>
- Hey. Hey. Hey!

1217
01:22:08,019 --> 01:22:09,611
- <i>To... </i>
- Hey!

1218
01:22:09,787 --> 01:22:11,721
- What is it?
- You said your aunt gave you $10,000

1219
01:22:11,889 --> 01:22:13,652
- To cultivate your voice?
- That's right.

1220
01:22:13,824 --> 01:22:15,155
What did you do with the money?

1221
01:22:19,530 --> 01:22:21,157
You still wanna hear
"Just One More Chance"?

1222
01:22:21,365 --> 01:22:23,162
Yeah, and I'd like to hear it today.

1223
01:22:27,304 --> 01:22:29,704
- You like my playing?
- Sure, cut the cards.

1224
01:22:29,940 --> 01:22:31,532
I mean, do you like the music?

1225
01:22:31,776 --> 01:22:35,143
Oh, it's fine. All you need now
is a monkey and a tin cup.

1226
01:22:35,312 --> 01:22:37,177
Come around tomorrow,
I have the tin cup.

1227
01:22:40,051 --> 01:22:42,110
Look, you keep this up
and I'm gonna have you evicted.

1228
01:22:44,789 --> 01:22:47,223
- What's the matter?
- You said a dirty word!

1229
01:22:47,391 --> 01:22:48,551
I only said "evicted".

1230
01:22:50,628 --> 01:22:51,959
You said it again!

1231
01:22:52,129 --> 01:22:54,597
- You keep this up and I'm gonna...
- Don't you say that word again!

1232
01:22:54,765 --> 01:22:56,790
It only means "ejected".

1233
01:22:57,902 --> 01:22:59,369
That's dirtier than the other one!

1234
01:23:02,006 --> 01:23:03,564
That does it. Usher!

1235
01:23:03,741 --> 01:23:05,834
- Get him out of here...
- You're not gonna let me sing?

1236
01:23:06,010 --> 01:23:08,740
Why don't you stop it? If you have
any talent, come on down here.

1237
01:23:08,913 --> 01:23:12,815
OK. It's easier looking
at the audience than at you.

1238
01:23:21,859 --> 01:23:23,383
Get off the stage.

1239
01:23:23,594 --> 01:23:25,653
I hope you're satisfied with the way
you embarrassed me

1240
01:23:25,830 --> 01:23:26,922
in front of everybody.

1241
01:23:27,131 --> 01:23:29,258
Lookit, the whole audience
is staring at me.

1242
01:23:29,433 --> 01:23:31,298
Stare back at them.

1243
01:23:31,469 --> 01:23:33,130
No, better they stare at you.

1244
01:23:33,304 --> 01:23:36,034
Go on, get off the stage,
and take this with you.

1245
01:23:36,807 --> 01:23:38,035
- All right, I'll go.
- Get off.

1246
01:23:38,209 --> 01:23:39,403
- But you'll be sorry.
- Get off!

1247
01:23:39,577 --> 01:23:41,306
- I'll get even with you.
- Get off the stage!

1248
01:23:41,479 --> 01:23:43,071
I don't know how or when,
but I will, boy.

1249

<i>Just one more chance</i>

<i>I've learned the meaning</i>

<i>Just one more word</i>

1259
01:24:32,096 --> 01:24:35,293
<i>I said that I was glad</i>

Mr. Miller! Mr. Miller! Mr. Miller,

1263
01:24:59,857 --> 01:25:03,349
Mr. Miller! Mr. Miller!

1264
01:25:41,365 --> 01:25:45,028
- <i>Just one more chance</i>

<i>To prove it's you alone I care for</i>

1266
01:25:48,239 --> 01:25:49,763
I picked it just for you
out of my garden

1267

<i>Each night I say a little prayer for</i>

1268
01:25:52,776 --> 01:25:54,573

<i>Just one more chance</i>

<i>To taste the kisses that enchant me</i>

1272
01:26:04,154 --> 01:26:08,386
- <i>I'd want no others if you'd grant me</i>
- What?

1273
01:26:08,559 --> 01:26:11,995
<i>Just one more chance</i>

1274
01:26:12,897 --> 01:26:15,559
<i>I've learned the meaning</i>
<i>Of repentance</i>

1275
01:26:15,733 --> 01:26:17,758
I'm glad because I spoke
to the fellows last year

1276
01:26:17,935 --> 01:26:19,095
and how they felt...

1277
01:26:19,270 --> 01:26:23,707
- <i>Now, you're the jury at my trial</i>
- Your Honor, this man had a murder...

1278
01:26:23,874 --> 01:26:26,672
<i>I know that I should serve</i>
<i>My sentence</i>

1279
01:26:26,844 --> 01:26:29,574
It's gonna be all right, Rockie.
You gotta have faith in your attorney

1280
01:26:29,747 --> 01:26:32,511
I spoke to Fred Sunday and he said
if he can get you out...

1281
01:26:32,683 --> 01:26:36,585
<i>Still I'm hoping all the while</i>
<i>You'll give me</i>

1282
01:26:36,787 --> 01:26:38,687
What, what?

1283
01:26:38,856 --> 01:26:41,654
- <i>Just one more word</i>
- Word.

1284
01:26:41,825 --> 01:26:44,555
W-O-R-D.
Spelled backwards, "Drow".

1285
01:26:44,728 --> 01:26:47,253
Spelled backwards, "Drow".

1286
01:26:48,532 --> 01:26:51,968
<i>I said that I was glad</i>
<i>To start out</i>

1287
01:26:52,136 --> 01:26:54,502
- What made you come back?
- Well, Mother said if I came back,

1288
01:26:54,672 --> 01:26:56,469
she'd give me the car, so I...

1289
01:26:56,640 --> 01:26:59,666
<i>But now I'm back</i>
<i>To cry my heart out</i>

1290
01:26:59,843 --> 01:27:01,140
I know how you feel. Don't cry,

1291
01:27:01,312 --> 01:27:04,713
because it's those feelings
of a man who certainly...

1292
01:27:05,349 --> 01:27:08,284
<i>Oh, just one more chance</i>

1293
01:27:08,452 --> 01:27:10,750
<i>I hear you talking, babe</i>

1294
01:27:10,921 --> 01:27:14,084
<i>Say just one more chance</i>

1295
01:27:21,598 --> 01:27:21,932
I'm sorry.

1296
01:27:21,932 --> 01:27:23,490
I'm sorry.

1297
01:27:24,568 --> 01:27:26,365
Excuse me.

1298
01:27:28,272 --> 01:27:30,900
- How are they?
- How are they, how are they?

1299
01:27:31,075 --> 01:27:33,942
Wait till you see
what they said about me.

1300
01:27:35,446 --> 01:27:38,574
Look at this.
"New Revue Smash Hit."

1301
01:27:39,149 --> 01:27:42,118
Here. "One of the highlights
of the evening was the box act

1302
01:27:42,286 --> 01:27:44,481
"of Bill Miller and Ted Rogers.

1303
01:27:44,655 --> 01:27:47,351
"It's a long time since Broadway
has seen a fellow

1304
01:27:47,524 --> 01:27:49,151
"as funny as the man in the box.

1305
01:27:50,160 --> 01:27:52,185
"And, incidentally,
though he wasn't billed anywhere

1306
01:27:52,363 --> 01:27:54,831
"in the theater last night,
his name is Ted Rogers.

1307
01:27:54,999 --> 01:27:57,024
"Make a note, everybody:
Ted Rogers."

1308
01:27:57,201 --> 01:27:58,862
Well, how about a drink, everybody?

1309
01:27:59,036 --> 01:28:01,834
That's a good idea.
Go ahead, Bill, you make the toast.

1310
01:28:02,473 --> 01:28:05,738
I'd like to propose a toast
to a wonderful guy:

1311
01:28:06,043 --> 01:28:07,840
Mr. Sutherland.

1312
01:28:11,615 --> 01:28:14,083
Well, anyone like to dance
with an agent?

1313
01:28:14,251 --> 01:28:16,276
Yes, I'd love to.

1314
01:28:23,427 --> 01:28:26,260
Hello, Mary. Sit down.

1315
01:28:29,867 --> 01:28:31,630
What's on your mind?

1316
01:28:32,036 --> 01:28:34,231
Leo, do you think Bill
has any intention

1317
01:28:34,405 --> 01:28:37,863
of putting Ted's name up
and recognizing him as a partner?

1318
01:28:40,744 --> 01:28:42,336
I don't either.

1319
01:28:42,513 --> 01:28:45,482
Never found that sweet, wonderful
guy underneath, after all, huh, Mary?

1320
01:28:45,649 --> 01:28:49,517
Maybe there is a nice guy underneath,
but I'm tired of digging.

1321
01:28:51,455 --> 01:28:53,013
Yes?

1322
01:28:54,091 --> 01:28:56,685
- It's Bill. He's outside.
- I don't want him to know I'm here.

1323
01:28:56,860 --> 01:29:00,023
Just a minute. Come in here.

1324
01:29:06,804 --> 01:29:08,772
All right, send him in.

1325
01:29:10,607 --> 01:29:14,703
Well, Leo, looks like I hit the jackpot.
You ever read such reviews?

1326
01:29:14,878 --> 01:29:16,539
Tell you what I want, Leo:

1327
01:29:17,214 --> 01:29:19,239
Full page ads, back page.

1328
01:29:19,416 --> 01:29:23,682
<i>Variety</i>, <i>Billboard</i>, all the trade papers
in the country. Shoot the works.

1329
01:29:23,854 --> 01:29:25,082
Full-page picture of me...

1330
01:29:25,255 --> 01:29:27,348
- What about the kid?
- What about him?

1331
01:29:27,524 --> 01:29:29,856
I think you ought to have his picture
and his name on the ads,

1332
01:29:30,027 --> 01:29:32,427
- Right alongside of yours.
- Well, I don't.

1333
01:29:32,596 --> 01:29:37,056
Everybody else does: critics,
all your friends, even your wife.

1334
01:29:37,234 --> 01:29:39,998
Look, Leo, no critic's gonna tell me
how to run my business.

1335
01:29:40,170 --> 01:29:41,694
Neither are my friends or my wife.

1336
01:29:42,005 --> 01:29:44,200
This is my act. Bill Miller, single-O.

1337
01:29:44,942 --> 01:29:47,410
The kid's all right.
Nobody likes him better than I do.

1338
01:29:48,078 --> 01:29:50,239
There's something you wise guys
don't understand.

1339
01:29:50,414 --> 01:29:53,383
Once that kid's name is mentioned,
then he's no more part of the audience.

1340
01:29:53,550 --> 01:29:55,415
And when that happens,
he stops being funny.

1341
01:29:55,886 --> 01:29:57,683
You're right, and I'd agree with you
100 percent

1342
01:29:57,855 --> 01:30:00,289
if the kid was an ordinary stooge.
But he's not.

1343
01:30:00,457 --> 01:30:01,617
He's half your act.

1344
01:30:01,792 --> 01:30:03,020
Sure, and he's gone over that way

1345
01:30:03,193 --> 01:30:05,491
because he's still a member
of the audience. Unknown.

1346
01:30:05,662 --> 01:30:07,254
Look, Bill, you're a phenomenon.

1347
01:30:08,465 --> 01:30:12,196
I've handled hundreds of actors
in my time but you take all the prizes.

1348
01:30:12,703 --> 01:30:15,103
You're a ham with a double M.

1349
01:30:16,640 --> 01:30:18,471
- What's that?
- It's our contract.

1350
01:30:18,976 --> 01:30:20,841
- Are you serious?
- Yep.

1351
01:30:22,079 --> 01:30:24,070
I woke up this morning
and it suddenly occurred to me,

1352
01:30:24,248 --> 01:30:26,079
you have to let the other fellow live.

1353
01:30:26,283 --> 01:30:29,275
Unless you do,
the whole thing is nothing.

1354
01:30:29,586 --> 01:30:34,182
All my life, I've wanted to do one thing
as a matter of principle.

1355
01:30:34,525 --> 01:30:37,358
Well, today, I am a man.

1356
01:30:39,663 --> 01:30:41,756
That was a mighty pretty speech
you just made.

1357
01:30:41,932 --> 01:30:44,332
- What's going on here?
- But yours wasn't.

1358
01:30:44,501 --> 01:30:46,935
Your little speech was petty
and kind of cheap.

1359
01:30:47,104 --> 01:30:49,538
I'm surprised you didn't cancel him
a long time ago, Leo.

1360
01:30:49,740 --> 01:30:51,708
Well, if that's the way he feels,
I don't need him.

1361
01:30:51,875 --> 01:30:53,934
You're right, Bill.
You don't need him, either.

1362
01:30:54,111 --> 01:30:56,011
And every day it'll be someone else
you don't need.

1363
01:30:56,180 --> 01:30:58,512
And one night, you'll be
sitting around all by yourself

1364
01:30:58,682 --> 01:31:00,513
in front of a pile
of your own photographs.

1365
01:31:00,851 --> 01:31:03,843
Well, from now on, you may consider
our contract at an end.

1366
01:31:04,388 --> 01:31:06,856
Mary, you don't mean that.

1367
01:31:34,017 --> 01:31:36,315
Well, what's the matter with you?

1368
01:31:36,887 --> 01:31:40,755
- Oh, nothing.
- Come on. What is it?

1369
01:31:42,693 --> 01:31:45,423
- I don't know if I should say it.
- Go ahead and say it.

1370
01:31:50,067 --> 01:31:51,728
What are you gonna do
about Mary, Bill?

1371
01:31:51,902 --> 01:31:55,463
- You got any ideas?
- No.

1372
01:31:55,939 --> 01:31:58,100
Except I don't think you ought to
let her go away.

1373
01:31:58,275 --> 01:32:01,938
- It's a free country, isn't it?
- Sure, Bill.

1374
01:32:02,112 --> 01:32:04,512
But she loves you,
and if there's something wrong,

1375
01:32:04,681 --> 01:32:08,481
I think you ought to go to her
and try and straighten it out.

1376
01:32:09,820 --> 01:32:11,447
Maybe it's none
of my business, but...

1377
01:32:11,622 --> 01:32:15,149
That's right.
It's none of your business.

1378
01:32:17,427 --> 01:32:20,885
- Yeah, maybe it's not.
- So shut up.

1379
01:32:24,835 --> 01:32:28,999
You know, I think you had
a lot to do with Mary leaving me.

1380
01:32:29,172 --> 01:32:30,400
Oh, don't say that, Bill.

1381
01:32:30,574 --> 01:32:35,011
All that stuff about
anything I do is OK with you.

1382
01:32:35,512 --> 01:32:38,811
I knock my brains out trying
to make something of myself.

1383
01:32:38,982 --> 01:32:42,816
And you, you with
your checkered suit.

1384
01:32:43,053 --> 01:32:44,452
What do I get for it?

1385
01:32:44,621 --> 01:32:47,317
You're talking crazy, Bill.
You shouldn't be thinking that way.

1386
01:32:47,491 --> 01:32:50,016
- I don't like to hear it.
- You don't like it?

1387
01:32:50,227 --> 01:32:52,923
Well, that's tough. I don't like it.

1388
01:32:53,096 --> 01:32:55,724
I'm sick and tired
of looking at you anyway.

1389
01:32:58,935 --> 01:33:00,869
You really mean that?

1390
01:33:04,441 --> 01:33:06,341
OK, Bill.

1391
01:33:10,113 --> 01:33:11,876
I'll move out of
the apartment tonight.

1392
01:33:12,049 --> 01:33:14,449
That makes two of us.

1393
01:33:16,153 --> 01:33:17,848
Bye, Bill.

1394
01:33:19,122 --> 01:33:20,953
Don't drink too much.

1395
01:33:21,124 --> 01:33:23,752
Remember, you've got
a show to do tonight.

1396
01:33:28,198 --> 01:33:31,565
You bet I've got a show to do.
I'll show everybody.

1397
01:33:35,172 --> 01:33:37,470
Gee, Mary, I wish you weren't
going to Europe.

1398
01:33:37,641 --> 01:33:41,372
Thanks, Frecklehead,
but it'll be good for me to get away.

1399
01:33:41,545 --> 01:33:44,673
Doctors say
nothing like an ocean voyage...

1400
01:33:45,882 --> 01:33:49,147
- Answer it, please.
- Sure.

1401
01:33:52,222 --> 01:33:53,780
Hello?

1402
01:33:54,257 --> 01:33:57,158
Oh, just a minute, Mr. Sutherland.
It's Sutherland.

1403
01:33:57,327 --> 01:33:58,919
I'll take it.

1404
01:34:00,297 --> 01:34:01,628
Hello, Mr. Sutherland.

1405
01:34:01,798 --> 01:34:05,598
Mary, I hate to bother you,
but we've quite a problem.

1406
01:34:05,769 --> 01:34:08,829
Bill's insisting upon going on,
but there's no Ted.

1407
01:34:09,005 --> 01:34:12,065
He and the kid have broken up.
I can't find him anywhere.

1408
01:34:12,275 --> 01:34:13,833
And Bill wants to do a single.

1409
01:34:14,010 --> 01:34:16,535
Bill's all right. He's just been trying
to prove something

1410
01:34:16,713 --> 01:34:18,772
since the day he was born.

1411
01:34:19,349 --> 01:34:22,477
Mr. Sutherland,
would you do me one big favor?

1412
01:34:22,753 --> 01:34:24,311
Let Bill do his single.

1413
01:34:24,488 --> 01:34:26,319
But, Mary, that's too risky.

1414
01:34:27,057 --> 01:34:30,584
One act would never make or break
the Sutherland Revue,

1415
01:34:30,761 --> 01:34:33,628
but it might make or break
a great guy.

1416
01:34:33,830 --> 01:34:36,298
Please, Mr. Sutherland. For me?

1417
01:34:36,500 --> 01:34:39,992
For his sake? Let him go on.

1418
01:34:40,570 --> 01:34:42,765
So this panhandler walked
over to me and said,

1419
01:34:42,939 --> 01:34:45,965
"I haven't had a bite in three days."
So I bit him.

1420
01:34:46,877 --> 01:34:49,710
Which reminds me, I was standing
in front of the Hotel Astor...

1421
01:34:49,880 --> 01:34:52,713
That's where I live,
in front of the Hotel Astor...

1422
01:34:53,383 --> 01:34:54,611
When my wife came up
to see me.

1423
01:34:54,785 --> 01:34:56,616
You know, my wife and I
were gonna get a divorce,

1424
01:34:56,787 --> 01:34:59,278
but we couldn't figure out who got
the custody of her mother.

1425
01:35:01,191 --> 01:35:03,421
Which reminds me, I took my
mother-in-law to the beach,

1426
01:35:03,593 --> 01:35:05,618
but the only thing that got sunburned
was her tongue.

1427
01:35:21,445 --> 01:35:24,573
Ladies and gentlemen,
I want to apologize.

1428
01:35:25,348 --> 01:35:29,409
This is the Sutherland Revue...

1429
01:35:29,719 --> 01:35:31,880
...which is supposed to bring you
the finest entertainment

1430
01:35:32,055 --> 01:35:33,750
that can be offered.

1431
01:35:34,424 --> 01:35:36,654
You've heard of an act, Bill Miller.

1432
01:35:36,827 --> 01:35:38,852
And Bill Miller is me.

1433
01:35:39,329 --> 01:35:40,956
But I'm only half an act.

1434
01:35:41,832 --> 01:35:45,996
The fellow that made the act work
is a little guy by the name of...

1435
01:35:46,269 --> 01:35:48,134
...Ted Rogers.

1436
01:35:48,371 --> 01:35:50,601
And he isn't here tonight.

1437
01:35:51,374 --> 01:35:54,901
I can play an accordion
and sing a song.

1438
01:35:55,345 --> 01:35:58,576
But I need that spark,
that something...

1439
01:35:58,748 --> 01:36:02,275
...the chemistry that makes two men
a successful team.

1440
01:36:03,620 --> 01:36:07,750
I've bored you,
and I've imposed upon you.

1441
01:36:08,758 --> 01:36:11,488
I've done an injustice
to an audience.

1442
01:36:12,529 --> 01:36:15,623
This is the biggest sin
in show business.

1443
01:36:15,799 --> 01:36:17,630
To be a ham.

1444
01:36:18,635 --> 01:36:21,035
I humbly apologize.

1445
01:36:22,572 --> 01:36:26,099
- Who's your little whozis?
- None of your business...

1446
01:36:29,946 --> 01:36:32,107
Who's your turtledove?

1447
01:36:38,522 --> 01:36:40,990
Who's your turtledove?

1448
01:36:43,727 --> 01:36:48,187
- <i>Who's your turtledove? </i>
- <i>Who's your turtledove? </i>

1449
01:36:48,365 --> 01:36:53,462
<i>Who's your little whozis? </i>
<i>Who do you love? </i>

1450
01:36:53,637 --> 01:36:55,434
You mean you finally learned
the words?

1451
01:36:55,605 --> 01:36:56,663
Listen to this.

1452
01:36:56,907 --> 01:36:59,398
<i>Who's your little whatzis? </i>

1453
01:36:59,576 --> 01:37:01,168
Not bad, huh?

1454
01:37:01,344 --> 01:37:03,437
<i>That you're dreaming of</i>

1455
01:37:03,613 --> 01:37:05,547
I've been paying attention too.

1456
01:37:05,715 --> 01:37:11,210
<i>Who's your little whozis? </i>
<i>Who do you love? </i>

1457
01:37:11,388 --> 01:37:13,413
- Take it, boy.
- No, you take it.

1458
01:37:13,590 --> 01:37:18,459
<i>Tell me who has you aflutter</i>

1459
01:37:18,628 --> 01:37:22,860
<i>Whenever they're passing by</i>

1460
01:37:25,135 --> 01:37:28,866
<i>Melts your heart like butter</i>

1461
01:37:29,039 --> 01:37:32,998
<i>Oh, me, oh, my</i>

1462
01:37:33,176 --> 01:37:36,111
<i>Say, when you get the blueses</i>

1463
01:37:36,279 --> 01:37:38,440
<i>When you get the blueses</i>

1464
01:37:38,615 --> 01:37:42,813
- <i>Who you thinking of? </i>
- <i>Who you thinking of? </i>

1465
01:37:42,986 --> 01:37:45,887
- <i>Who's your little whozis? </i>
- <i>Who's your little whozis? </i>

1466
01:37:46,056 --> 01:37:48,923
<i>Who do you love? </i>

1467
01:38:34,971 --> 01:38:37,735
<i>Who's your little whozis? </i>

1468
01:38:37,907 --> 01:38:40,967
<i>A girl named Mary</i>

1469
01:38:42,078 --> 01:38:45,514
<i>And a boy named Bill</i>

1470
01:38:46,816 --> 01:38:49,683
<i>Who's your turtledove? </i>

1471
01:38:51,755 --> 01:38:55,748
- <i>It's so wonderful</i>
- <i>It's so wonderful</i>

1472
01:38:55,925 --> 01:38:59,588
- <i>To be in love</i>
- <i>To be in love</i>

1473
01:38:59,763 --> 01:39:04,097
- <i>With you</i>
- <i>With you</i>
