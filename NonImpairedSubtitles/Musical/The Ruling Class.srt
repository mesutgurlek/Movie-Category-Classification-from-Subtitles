1
00:01:28,887 --> 00:01:32,345
My lords, gentlemen,

2
00:01:32,424 --> 00:01:37,361
pray silence for Ralph Douglas
Christopher Alexander Gurney,

3
00:01:37,429 --> 00:01:40,227
the 13th earl of Gurney.

4
00:01:42,901 --> 00:01:44,869
Thank you.

5
00:01:47,172 --> 00:01:50,198
The aim of the
Society of St. George...

6
00:01:50,275 --> 00:01:53,870
is to keep green
the memory of England.

7
00:01:53,945 --> 00:01:58,712
We were once the rulers...

8
00:01:58,784 --> 00:02:02,083
of the greatest empire
the world has ever known!

9
00:02:02,154 --> 00:02:07,057
<i>- Hear, hear!
- Ruled not by superior force or skill,</i>

10
00:02:07,125 --> 00:02:11,528
but by sheer presence.

11
00:02:11,596 --> 00:02:14,087
Hear, hear!

12
00:02:14,166 --> 00:02:17,829
So I give you England.

13
00:02:17,903 --> 00:02:22,067
This teeming womb of privilege.

14
00:02:22,140 --> 00:02:24,404
This feudal state...

15
00:02:24,476 --> 00:02:30,073
whose shores beat back
the turbulent sea of foreign anarchy.

16
00:02:30,148 --> 00:02:32,742
This ancient fortress,

17
00:02:32,818 --> 00:02:36,413
still commanded by the noblest
of our royal blood.

18
00:02:36,488 --> 00:02:38,422
Hear, hear!

19
00:02:38,490 --> 00:02:41,323
This ancient land of ritual.

20
00:02:41,393 --> 00:02:43,953
This precious stone...

21
00:02:44,029 --> 00:02:46,554
set in the silver sea.

22
00:02:46,631 --> 00:02:50,567
The toast is "England.
This precious stone...

23
00:02:50,635 --> 00:02:53,297
set in the silver sea."

24
00:02:58,243 --> 00:03:02,407
England. Set in the silver sea.

25
00:03:09,287 --> 00:03:15,226
<i># God save our gracious Queen #</i>

26
00:03:15,293 --> 00:03:21,459
<i>#Scatter Her enemies #</i>

27
00:03:21,533 --> 00:03:27,028
<i>#And make them fall #</i>

28
00:03:34,512 --> 00:03:40,815
<i># Confound their politics #</i>

29
00:03:40,886 --> 00:03:47,348
<i>#Frustrate their knavish tricks #</i>

30
00:03:47,425 --> 00:03:54,490
<i># On Thee our hopes we fix #</i>

31
00:03:54,566 --> 00:04:01,301
<i># God save the Queen ##</i>

32
00:04:06,444 --> 00:04:08,537
Ah, thank you, Tuck.

33
00:04:09,915 --> 00:04:12,110
How was your speech, my lord?

34
00:04:12,183 --> 00:04:14,117
Went well, Tuck.

35
00:04:14,185 --> 00:04:18,121
Englishmen like to hear
the truth about themselves.

36
00:04:18,189 --> 00:04:20,680
He's back, Claire.

37
00:04:20,759 --> 00:04:24,855
Claire!
I said, Ralph is back.

38
00:04:24,930 --> 00:04:29,993
Thank you, Charles.
I'll have a vodka and tonic.

39
00:04:30,068 --> 00:04:33,697
I say, guv'nor, the guv'nor is back.

40
00:04:33,772 --> 00:04:36,832
Mummy, I was just telling the guv'nor
that the guv'nor is back.

41
00:04:36,908 --> 00:04:39,308
Charles! With ice.

42
00:04:39,377 --> 00:04:42,904
I'm repeating myself,
calling the guv'nor the guv'nor
and Daddy the guv'nor as well.

43
00:04:42,981 --> 00:04:46,178
- Tucker, I'm getting married again.
- Very good, my lord.

44
00:04:46,251 --> 00:04:48,947
Miss Grace Shelley.
Charles is right.

45
00:04:49,020 --> 00:04:51,716
Been putting it off.
Sake of the family.

46
00:04:51,790 --> 00:04:53,724
OnlyJack left.

47
00:04:53,792 --> 00:04:58,024
This house... used to be
full of mischief.

48
00:04:58,096 --> 00:05:01,361
Four young devils.

49
00:05:01,433 --> 00:05:04,266
Thought I was safe enough.

50
00:05:04,336 --> 00:05:07,203
Master Paul would have been
the 14th earl.

51
00:05:07,272 --> 00:05:09,638
District officer at 21.

52
00:05:09,708 --> 00:05:12,438
Dead at 23. Beriberi.

53
00:05:12,510 --> 00:05:16,674
Picked it up off some scruffy
fuzzy-wuzzy in dressing gown.

54
00:05:16,748 --> 00:05:19,046
Shouldn't wonder, eh?

55
00:05:19,117 --> 00:05:22,018
Master Richard
used to play the xylophone.

56
00:05:22,087 --> 00:05:25,113
And young Raymond,
killed in Malaya.

57
00:05:25,190 --> 00:05:28,387
Not one of them buried in England.

58
00:05:28,460 --> 00:05:30,621
Never seen their graves.

59
00:05:30,695 --> 00:05:32,720
You could do that
on your honeymoon, my lord.

60
00:05:35,667 --> 00:05:39,899
Hmm, there's stillJack.

61
00:05:48,179 --> 00:05:51,876
It's all based on land, Tuck.

62
00:05:51,950 --> 00:05:55,852
Can't have those knaves
from Whitehall moving in.

63
00:05:55,920 --> 00:05:58,286
So it's Miss Grace Shelley.

64
00:05:59,791 --> 00:06:01,918
Is she anyone, my lord?

65
00:06:01,993 --> 00:06:06,430
No one. But Charles recommends her
as good breeding stock.

66
00:06:06,498 --> 00:06:09,865
Family foals well.
Sires, mostly.

67
00:06:09,934 --> 00:06:13,802
There's always room at the top for
brains, money or a good pair of titties.

68
00:06:15,874 --> 00:06:18,399
Miss Shelley seems
well endowed, my lord.

69
00:06:18,476 --> 00:06:21,968
<i>Hmm.</i>

70
00:06:22,047 --> 00:06:25,448
Oh, the guv'nor loved this bed.

71
00:06:25,517 --> 00:06:28,680
Took it all over
the world with him.

72
00:06:28,753 --> 00:06:32,689
Devilish great man,
the guv'nor. Superb shot.

73
00:06:32,757 --> 00:06:35,248
Did wonderful needlework too.

74
00:06:35,326 --> 00:06:37,988
What do you got there, hmm?

75
00:06:39,064 --> 00:06:41,055
Huh.

76
00:06:43,001 --> 00:06:45,936
Oh, yes. Why not?

77
00:06:46,004 --> 00:06:50,703
Hard day. Need to relax.

78
00:06:50,775 --> 00:06:53,243
Might I suggest
the silk tonight, sir?

79
00:06:53,311 --> 00:06:55,779
Good idea, Tuck.

80
00:06:55,847 --> 00:06:58,941
For St. George, eh?

81
00:07:02,087 --> 00:07:05,682
<i>Ah, Tuck, there's no end to duty.</i>

82
00:07:05,757 --> 00:07:08,692
<i>The law has been my life, Tuck.</i>

83
00:07:08,760 --> 00:07:11,786
<i>Ajudge can't be unreasonable...</i>

84
00:07:11,863 --> 00:07:14,263
so how can he be a lover, eh?

85
00:07:15,500 --> 00:07:18,435
Ours is a damned dry world, Tuck.

86
00:07:18,503 --> 00:07:22,940
A long life
and a gray one, my lord.

87
00:07:23,007 --> 00:07:25,771
The power of life and death.

88
00:07:25,844 --> 00:07:29,575
Ajudge has no need for other vices.

89
00:07:29,647 --> 00:07:34,448
<i>Once you put on a black cap,
everything else tastes like wax fruit.</i>

90
00:07:34,519 --> 00:07:37,920
Uh, noose a bit high, Tuck.
Bring it down half an inch.

91
00:07:37,989 --> 00:07:40,184
<i>That's it.</i>

92
00:07:40,258 --> 00:07:42,283
Will that be all, my lord?

93
00:07:42,360 --> 00:07:45,659
A whiskey and soda
in about five minutes, as usual.

94
00:07:45,730 --> 00:07:48,722
Oh, Tuck,
I shan't be dining tonight.

95
00:07:48,800 --> 00:07:51,325
Tell cook the trial ends tomorrow,

96
00:07:51,402 --> 00:07:54,769
so I shall be wanting one of her
extra-large breakfasts in the morning.

97
00:07:54,839 --> 00:07:57,933
She knows I don't like passing
sentence on an empty stomach.

98
00:07:58,009 --> 00:08:00,910
- Very good, my lord.
- Thank you, Tuck.

99
00:08:08,119 --> 00:08:12,146
Nothing like a good English breakfast.

100
00:08:12,223 --> 00:08:14,885
<i>Big meal of the day for the guv'nor.</i>

101
00:08:14,959 --> 00:08:17,587
<i>Always read The Times through first...</i>

102
00:08:17,662 --> 00:08:20,654
in case there was anything
too disturbing in it.

103
00:08:20,732 --> 00:08:25,533
Mother never knew what the word
"socialist" meant till she was past 50.

104
00:08:28,840 --> 00:08:32,003
Remember standing
at the foot of the bed there...

105
00:08:32,076 --> 00:08:34,772
telling them
I wanted to be a painter.

106
00:08:34,846 --> 00:08:38,373
"The Gurneys have never
been slackers," he said.

107
00:08:38,449 --> 00:08:42,044
"Earned their privileges."

108
00:08:42,120 --> 00:08:45,283
Great concession
letting me study law.

109
00:08:45,356 --> 00:08:48,951
Not the Gurney tradition, no.
Always the army.

110
00:08:49,027 --> 00:08:53,225
# Feet, feet, feet
The boys are marching #

111
00:08:53,298 --> 00:08:55,459
A little more grapeshot,
Captain Bragg.

112
00:08:55,533 --> 00:08:58,900
Give 'em a touch
of the cold steel, boys.

113
00:09:33,905 --> 00:09:36,567
Close. It's getting close.

114
00:09:36,641 --> 00:09:39,906
I can feel her hot breath.
Wonderful, wonderful.

115
00:09:39,978 --> 00:09:43,379
One slip. Wonderful.
The worms have the best of it.

116
00:09:43,448 --> 00:09:47,942
They dine off the tenderest joints.
Juicy breasts, white thighs.

117
00:09:53,791 --> 00:09:57,921
'Tis a far, far better thing
I do now than I've ever done.

118
00:10:11,909 --> 00:10:15,345
No, sir, no bandage.
Die, my dear doctor?

119
00:10:15,413 --> 00:10:18,814
Oh, that is the last thing
I shall do.

120
00:10:21,419 --> 00:10:25,617
Is that you, my love?
Come to me.

121
00:10:25,690 --> 00:10:27,988
Come!

122
00:10:40,972 --> 00:10:44,533
Touched him. Saw her.

123
00:10:44,609 --> 00:10:47,407
Towers of death and silence.

124
00:10:47,478 --> 00:10:52,074
Angels of fire and ice.
Saw Alexander...

125
00:10:52,150 --> 00:10:55,916
covered with honey
and beeswax in his tomb.

126
00:10:55,987 --> 00:10:59,582
Felt the flowers growing over me.

127
00:10:59,657 --> 00:11:03,024
Oh, a man must have vision.

128
00:11:03,094 --> 00:11:07,155
How else could an English judge,
and peer of the realm...

129
00:11:07,231 --> 00:11:11,565
take moonlit trips
to Marrakesh and Ponders End?

130
00:11:11,636 --> 00:11:15,402
See six vestal virgins
smoking cigars?

131
00:11:15,473 --> 00:11:17,566
Moses in bedroom slippers?

132
00:11:17,642 --> 00:11:21,408
Naked bosoms floating past Formosa?

133
00:11:23,381 --> 00:11:25,815
Just time for a quick one.

134
00:11:25,883 --> 00:11:29,284
Be of good cheer, Master Ridley,

135
00:11:29,354 --> 00:11:31,322
and play the man.

136
00:11:31,389 --> 00:11:34,324
There's plenty of time
to win this game...

137
00:11:34,392 --> 00:11:36,860
and beat the Spaniards too.

138
00:11:36,928 --> 00:11:39,089
Form squares, men!

139
00:11:39,163 --> 00:11:43,099
Smash the Mahdi...
and Binnie Barnes!

140
00:11:51,843 --> 00:11:55,472
<i>- Are you ready,
Your Lordship?</i>

141
00:12:05,223 --> 00:12:07,316
Bleeding bloody hell.

142
00:12:53,404 --> 00:12:57,773
<i>"I am the resurrection
and the life, "sayeth the Lord.</i>

143
00:12:57,842 --> 00:13:00,242
"He that believeth in me...

144
00:13:00,311 --> 00:13:04,077
though he were dead,
yet shall he live.

145
00:13:04,148 --> 00:13:08,482
And whomsoever liveth
and believeth in me...

146
00:13:08,553 --> 00:13:11,113
shall never die.

147
00:13:12,323 --> 00:13:17,124
Gilead is mine
and Manasses is mine.

148
00:13:17,195 --> 00:13:21,894
Ephraim also
is the strength of my head.

149
00:13:21,966 --> 00:13:24,992
Judah is my lawgiver...

150
00:13:25,069 --> 00:13:28,368
and Moab is my washpot.

151
00:13:28,439 --> 00:13:32,637
Over Edom will I cast out
my shoe...

152
00:13:32,710 --> 00:13:36,806
and upon Philistria
will I triumph.

153
00:13:36,881 --> 00:13:41,250
Who will lead me
into the strong city...

154
00:13:41,319 --> 00:13:46,814
and who will bring me
into Edom?"

155
00:13:57,735 --> 00:14:02,035
#All things
bright and beautiful #

156
00:14:02,106 --> 00:14:07,043
#All creatures great and small #

157
00:14:07,111 --> 00:14:11,673
#All things wise and wonderful #

158
00:14:11,749 --> 00:14:17,278
#The Lord God made them all ##

159
00:14:22,527 --> 00:14:25,928
An excellent service, Bertie.
Created exactly the right impression.

160
00:14:25,997 --> 00:14:28,591
Damned if I could understand
a word of it.

161
00:14:28,666 --> 00:14:30,964
I hardly expected you to, my boy.

162
00:14:31,035 --> 00:14:32,969
Charles, I must
have a word with you.

163
00:14:33,037 --> 00:14:35,301
Charles, you see,
this was a service...

164
00:14:35,373 --> 00:14:38,604
which I could not have conducted
for someone who may have laid...

165
00:14:38,676 --> 00:14:40,837
vi-violent hands upon himself.

166
00:14:40,912 --> 00:14:43,972
Wait, Charles.
A disturbing rumor has reached me.

167
00:14:44,048 --> 00:14:46,812
Tell me, did Ralph commit suicide?

168
00:14:46,884 --> 00:14:49,910
Suicide? Tucker found Ralph
hanging in his bedroom...

169
00:14:49,987 --> 00:14:52,717
wearing a cocked hat,
underpants and a ballet skirt.

170
00:14:52,790 --> 00:14:56,817
- Does that sound like suicide?
- Oh, no, no, it does not.

171
00:14:56,894 --> 00:14:59,886
But l-l-I had to be sure,
Charles. After all, he...

172
00:14:59,964 --> 00:15:02,831
well, he is buried
in consecrated ground.

173
00:15:02,900 --> 00:15:05,664
I must say, it's damned
odd to find Uncle Ralph...

174
00:15:05,736 --> 00:15:08,068
hanging around like that
in a ballet skirt.

175
00:15:08,139 --> 00:15:12,007
Charles, didn't you say Ralph
was always rather... artistic?

176
00:15:12,076 --> 00:15:15,011
He was willful, stubborn,
and this time he went too far.

177
00:15:15,079 --> 00:15:18,048
But he was my brother.
Well, half brother.

178
00:15:18,115 --> 00:15:21,175
I will not have you
calling him artistic.

179
00:15:21,252 --> 00:15:24,380
Cocked hat. Cocked hat.
You said cocked hat, Charles.

180
00:15:24,455 --> 00:15:26,616
Wh-Why was Ralph
wearing a cocked hat?

181
00:15:26,691 --> 00:15:28,852
Trying it on for size, obviously.

182
00:15:28,926 --> 00:15:31,326
I told him
not to remain a widower.

183
00:15:31,395 --> 00:15:33,863
The guv'nor didn't have
to start breeding again.

184
00:15:33,931 --> 00:15:36,092
It was not pleasant
for a man of Ralph's age,

185
00:15:36,167 --> 00:15:38,567
but that was something
he had to get on top of.

186
00:15:38,636 --> 00:15:42,504
Underpants. Wh-Why was...

187
00:15:42,573 --> 00:15:46,669
Why was he... Why was he...
Why was he in his underpants, Charles?

188
00:15:46,744 --> 00:15:49,110
Well, he was in his
bedroom, wasn't he?

189
00:15:49,180 --> 00:15:51,614
I thought all our troubles
would be over...

190
00:15:51,682 --> 00:15:54,116
when he took a fancy
to young Grace Shelley.

191
00:15:54,185 --> 00:15:56,881
- That would have solved everything.
- Yes, wouldn't it just?

192
00:15:56,954 --> 00:15:59,218
I do not know
what all the bother is about.

193
00:15:59,290 --> 00:16:02,350
Uncle Ralph has got an heir:
Jack, the 14th earl.

194
00:16:02,426 --> 00:16:04,553
Yes, there's always Jack.

195
00:16:04,629 --> 00:16:08,565
Yes, it's gonna be awkward.
Damned awkward.

196
00:16:08,633 --> 00:16:12,034
Well, Ralph knew the situation.
I'm sure he's made proper arrangements.

197
00:16:12,103 --> 00:16:16,039
It's simply a matter of finding out who
he's made legal guardian of the estate.

198
00:16:16,107 --> 00:16:18,905
Ballet skirt!

199
00:16:18,976 --> 00:16:23,777
What on earth was he doing in a ballet
skirt, Charles? Answer me that.

200
00:16:25,249 --> 00:16:27,774
A Mr. Matthew Peake
to see you, Sir Charles.

201
00:16:27,852 --> 00:16:31,413
Thank you, Tucker.
Come on in, Peake.

202
00:16:31,489 --> 00:16:33,582
I believe you know everyone here.

203
00:16:33,658 --> 00:16:35,489
I have that honor, Sir Charles.

204
00:16:35,559 --> 00:16:37,754
All right, that's all, Tucker.
We're not to be disturbed.

205
00:16:37,828 --> 00:16:41,992
Uh, might I suggest,
Sir Charles, that Tucker stays?

206
00:16:42,066 --> 00:16:44,091
What?

207
00:16:44,168 --> 00:16:46,102
Hmm, quite.

208
00:16:46,170 --> 00:16:48,730
Well, Tucker, it seems you're going
to hear something to your advantage.

209
00:16:48,806 --> 00:16:51,240
- Yes.
- Do sit down, Tucker.

210
00:16:51,308 --> 00:16:53,242
Thank you, madame.

211
00:16:53,310 --> 00:16:55,938
<i>May I take this opportunity
to express my condolences?</i>

212
00:16:56,013 --> 00:16:58,072
<i>Yes, yes, but do get on with it.</i>

213
00:16:58,149 --> 00:17:00,379
But, Sir Charles,
shouldn't we wait?

214
00:17:00,451 --> 00:17:02,919
- I mean, His Lordship's heir.
- He's been notified.

215
00:17:02,987 --> 00:17:05,717
Wasn't able to get away for the funeral,
so he's not likely to come now.

216
00:17:05,790 --> 00:17:09,055
Very well.
I will inform him later.

217
00:17:18,869 --> 00:17:21,497
"I, Ralph Douglas
Christopher Alexander Gurney...

218
00:17:21,572 --> 00:17:23,972
of Gurney House
in the county of Bedfordshire,

219
00:17:24,041 --> 00:17:27,272
hereby revoke all former wills
and codicils and declare this to be
my last will.

220
00:17:27,344 --> 00:17:30,973
I appoint Mr. Matthew Peake
of 17 Brownlow Gardens, Bedfordshire,

221
00:17:31,048 --> 00:17:33,516
to be the sole executor of my will.

222
00:17:34,919 --> 00:17:38,150
I give and bequeath
unto my manservant, Daniel Tucker...

223
00:17:38,222 --> 00:17:41,191
the sum of £30,000 free of duty."

224
00:17:41,258 --> 00:17:44,022
<i>- What?
- Thirty thousand?</i>

225
00:17:44,095 --> 00:17:47,258
<i>There follow a number
of bequests to various charities.</i>

226
00:17:47,331 --> 00:17:49,458
<i>I'll run through them briefly.</i>

227
00:17:49,533 --> 00:17:55,267
I bequeath the sum of £5,000 to the
Tail Wavers Registered National Charity,

228
00:17:55,339 --> 00:17:59,070
£3,000 to the Bankers
Benificent Society, Limited...

229
00:17:59,143 --> 00:18:02,874
Thirty-thousand smackers!
Yippee!

230
00:18:02,947 --> 00:18:06,883
# I'm Gilbert the Filbert
The Knut with a "K" #

231
00:18:06,951 --> 00:18:10,318
#The pride of Piccadilly
The blase roue #

232
00:18:10,387 --> 00:18:13,914
# Oh, Hades, the ladies
who leave their wooden hats #

233
00:18:13,991 --> 00:18:17,950
# For Gilbert the Filbert
The colonel of the Knuts ##

234
00:18:18,028 --> 00:18:21,191
<i>I say, Tucker seems a bit hit up.</i>

235
00:18:21,265 --> 00:18:24,428
So are the ways of everyone,
my boy, who is greedy of gain.

236
00:18:24,502 --> 00:18:27,471
Now then, Peake,
what about the Zambezi Mission?

237
00:18:27,538 --> 00:18:30,371
And what about
the Overseas Bishoprics Fund?

238
00:18:30,441 --> 00:18:33,604
- Oh, never mind about them, Bertie!
- Charles, the Zambezi...

239
00:18:33,677 --> 00:18:35,770
<i>What about the estate?</i>

240
00:18:35,846 --> 00:18:39,179
"I devise and bequeath the remainder
of my estate, both real and personal,

241
00:18:39,250 --> 00:18:42,014
<i>whatsoever and wheresoever
to which I might be entitled...</i>

242
00:18:42,086 --> 00:18:45,021
<i>or over which I have any disposing
at the time of my death...</i>

243
00:18:45,089 --> 00:18:50,652
to my beloved son,
Jack Arnold Alexander Tancred Gurney...

244
00:18:50,728 --> 00:18:54,926
<i>the 14th earl of Gurney,
for his own use absolutely. "</i>

245
00:18:54,999 --> 00:18:57,365
For his own use absolutely?

246
00:18:57,434 --> 00:18:59,925
Well, who's been appointed
legal guardian?

247
00:19:00,004 --> 00:19:02,996
No one.

248
00:19:03,073 --> 00:19:06,907
By the rivers of Babylon,
there we sat down. Yea, we wept...

249
00:19:06,977 --> 00:19:10,310
You mean Jack's free to run
the estate and everything?

250
00:19:10,381 --> 00:19:12,747
Jack'll cheer up
the House of Lords.

251
00:19:12,817 --> 00:19:16,275
Oh, Ralph obviously
let his personal feelings
come before his duty to his family.

252
00:19:16,353 --> 00:19:18,583
Well, we'll just
have to fight. Awkward.

253
00:19:18,656 --> 00:19:21,420
There's bound to be a scandal,
but there's no choice.

254
00:19:21,492 --> 00:19:24,290
"If this will be contested
in any way,

255
00:19:24,361 --> 00:19:27,023
the whole of my estate,
both real and personal,

256
00:19:27,097 --> 00:19:30,362
is bequeathed to the charities herewith:
The Earl Haig Fund..."

257
00:19:30,434 --> 00:19:34,302
- It's disgraceful!
- May God forgive him.

258
00:19:34,371 --> 00:19:36,771
How bizarre.
What a macabre sense of humor.

259
00:19:36,841 --> 00:19:40,140
- But, Father, I don't understand.
- You ask him to explain
before he explodes.

260
00:19:40,211 --> 00:19:43,078
Blast you, there's land at stake here,
Gurney land!

261
00:19:43,147 --> 00:19:45,581
- I'm completely in the fog.
- When were you not?

262
00:19:45,649 --> 00:19:47,947
I don't understand what...

263
00:19:50,855 --> 00:19:55,155
Ladies and gentlemen, the queen's
right trusty and well-beloved cousin,

264
00:19:55,226 --> 00:20:00,129
Jack Arnold
Alexander Tancred Gurney,

265
00:20:00,197 --> 00:20:03,064
14th earl of Gurney.

266
00:20:32,930 --> 00:20:34,830
Hello.

267
00:20:37,568 --> 00:20:41,436
I'm sorry I wasn't here before.
I received the news only yesterday.

268
00:20:41,505 --> 00:20:44,474
I'm afraid our little community
is somewhat cut off.

269
00:20:44,541 --> 00:20:47,635
I hope you'll forgive me.
I know he will.

270
00:20:47,711 --> 00:20:50,179
I've just been to his grave.

271
00:20:50,247 --> 00:20:53,444
Thank you, Uncle Charles,
for making all the arrangements.

272
00:20:56,921 --> 00:20:59,355
<i>Aunt Claire, you haven't changed.</i>

273
00:20:59,423 --> 00:21:01,516
Nor you.

274
00:21:01,592 --> 00:21:03,526
<i>You must be Dinsdale.</i>

275
00:21:03,594 --> 00:21:07,030
Yes, I suppose I must be.
How do you do?

276
00:21:07,097 --> 00:21:11,431
<i>Are you still angry
with me, Bishop?</i>

277
00:21:14,538 --> 00:21:17,200
Let me put your minds at rest.

278
00:21:17,274 --> 00:21:21,301
I'm coming back to take
my place in the world.

279
00:21:21,378 --> 00:21:25,041
The monastic ideal isn't easy.
I've had many broken nights.

280
00:21:25,115 --> 00:21:29,882
But I'm coming back refreshed,
though hardly equipped for society.

281
00:21:29,954 --> 00:21:32,889
I shall need your help, Charles.

282
00:21:32,957 --> 00:21:37,758
Come. We're all one family.
Let's wash away the old sores.

283
00:21:37,828 --> 00:21:40,763
If the bishop doesn't mind,
I think we should pray.

284
00:21:40,831 --> 00:21:44,892
- Pray?
- For love and understanding.

285
00:21:44,969 --> 00:21:47,733
Surely you pray
for love and understanding?

286
00:21:47,805 --> 00:21:50,535
Every night... without success.

287
00:21:53,477 --> 00:21:57,413
- You too, my son.
- I'm a Methodist.

288
00:21:57,481 --> 00:22:00,712
I'm sure you're
still a Christian. Come.

289
00:22:00,784 --> 00:22:03,412
<i>For me.</i>

290
00:22:03,487 --> 00:22:05,478
Yes, my lord.

291
00:22:21,839 --> 00:22:24,740
A prayer should rise up
like incense.

292
00:22:26,210 --> 00:22:29,839
A prayer is an act
of faith and union.

293
00:22:29,913 --> 00:22:33,713
To pray means to ask,
to beg, to plead.

294
00:22:33,784 --> 00:22:37,880
A prayer is a message to heaven.
You are talking directly to God.

295
00:22:37,955 --> 00:22:41,186
Express your desires freely.
Don't be afraid.

296
00:22:41,258 --> 00:22:43,726
I know them already.

297
00:22:43,794 --> 00:22:48,060
For I am the creator
and ruler of the universe.

298
00:22:48,132 --> 00:22:53,729
Khoda, the one supreme being
and infinite personal being.

299
00:22:53,804 --> 00:22:57,069
Yaweh, Shangri-Ti and EI,

300
00:22:57,141 --> 00:23:00,474
the First Immoveable Mover, yea,

301
00:23:00,544 --> 00:23:05,413
I am the Absolute, Unknowable,
Righteous, Eternal,

302
00:23:05,482 --> 00:23:10,283
the Lord of Hosts,
King of Kings, Lord of Lords,

303
00:23:10,354 --> 00:23:13,482
the Father, Son and Holy Ghost,

304
00:23:13,557 --> 00:23:17,015
the One True God,
the God of love,

305
00:23:17,094 --> 00:23:19,028
the Christ!

306
00:23:19,096 --> 00:23:22,623
His Lordship
is a paranoid schizophrenic.

307
00:23:22,699 --> 00:23:26,430
Paranoid schizophrenic?
But he's a Gurney.

308
00:23:26,503 --> 00:23:30,769
Then he's a paranoid schizophrenic
Gurney who believes he's God.

309
00:23:30,841 --> 00:23:33,002
But we've always been
Church of England.

310
00:23:33,077 --> 00:23:35,637
His idea of the world
we live in...

311
00:23:35,712 --> 00:23:38,408
is determined
solely by his feelings.

312
00:23:38,482 --> 00:23:40,609
What he feels is, is.

313
00:23:40,684 --> 00:23:44,211
If my nephew is bonkers, why
the blazes did you let him out?

314
00:23:44,288 --> 00:23:48,122
He's a voluntary patient in a private
clinic, free to go whenever he chooses.

315
00:23:48,192 --> 00:23:51,286
His father insisted on
no official certification.

316
00:23:51,361 --> 00:23:55,297
If you want him detained here
permanently, you must bring him
before the Board of Control...

317
00:23:55,365 --> 00:23:58,459
or get a master in lunacy
to sign an order.

318
00:23:58,535 --> 00:24:01,368
<i>Later, after we've
got a few things settled.</i>

319
00:24:01,438 --> 00:24:03,372
<i>From a medical point of view,</i>

320
00:24:03,440 --> 00:24:06,136
<i>a plunge into the working world
won't do the earl any harm.</i>

321
00:24:06,210 --> 00:24:09,304
Won't do him any harm?
What about the rest of us?

322
00:24:09,379 --> 00:24:12,041
<i>He's not dangerous.
Besides, I shall be on hand.</i>

323
00:24:12,116 --> 00:24:14,277
<i>It'll be an interesting
experiment.</i>

324
00:24:14,351 --> 00:24:17,548
A harsh dose of reality
can help towards a cure.

325
00:24:17,621 --> 00:24:20,920
Cure! You've had him here
for seven years. Look at him.

326
00:24:20,991 --> 00:24:23,391
What have you been doing?

327
00:24:23,460 --> 00:24:26,691
Exercising patience
and understanding,

328
00:24:26,763 --> 00:24:28,890
something he'll need
from his family.

329
00:24:28,966 --> 00:24:31,560
Yes, but why haven't you
used the knife?

330
00:24:31,635 --> 00:24:35,036
Because lobotomy is irrelevant
and dangerous in this case.

331
00:24:38,976 --> 00:24:43,037
<i>He can't forget being rejected by
his mother and father at the age of 11.</i>

332
00:24:43,113 --> 00:24:45,445
They sent him away, alone...

333
00:24:45,516 --> 00:24:49,577
into a primitive community of
licensed bullies and pederasts.

334
00:24:49,653 --> 00:24:53,419
- You mean he went to public school?
- Exactly.

335
00:24:53,490 --> 00:24:56,618
I'm aware of psychotherapy's
messy inadequacies,

336
00:24:56,693 --> 00:24:59,753
but I hope that my current
research will put it all...

337
00:24:59,830 --> 00:25:01,957
on a more scientific basis.

338
00:25:02,032 --> 00:25:04,592
But it depends on my getting
a Guldenheim grant.

339
00:25:04,668 --> 00:25:07,364
Well, never mind about that.
What aboutJack?

340
00:25:07,437 --> 00:25:11,066
Remember he's suffering
from delusions of grandeur.

341
00:25:11,141 --> 00:25:13,439
In reality, he's an earl,
an English aristocrat,

342
00:25:13,510 --> 00:25:15,444
a member of the ruling class.

343
00:25:15,512 --> 00:25:19,676
<i>Naturally he's come to believe there's
only one person grander than that:</i>

344
00:25:19,750 --> 00:25:21,741
The Lord God Almighty Himself.

345
00:25:21,818 --> 00:25:24,480
- Are you English?
- No.

346
00:25:24,555 --> 00:25:26,750
Ahhh.

347
00:25:30,894 --> 00:25:33,021
What's all this, then?

348
00:25:33,096 --> 00:25:36,293
It's His Lordship's effects.
Sign here, please.

349
00:25:38,902 --> 00:25:40,494
Christ.

350
00:25:40,571 --> 00:25:45,133
If I saw a man eating grass,
I'd say he was hungry.

351
00:25:45,209 --> 00:25:47,336
They'd have him certified.

352
00:25:47,411 --> 00:25:51,142
They claim that snow is only
precipitation and not candied dew.

353
00:25:51,215 --> 00:25:53,376
Whroom!
I'm always thinking so fast.

354
00:25:53,450 --> 00:25:56,715
Whroom! Space and time exist
only within the walls of my brain.

355
00:25:56,787 --> 00:25:58,982
Whroom!
What I'm trying to say...

356
00:25:59,056 --> 00:26:01,149
is if the words sound queer
or funny to your ear,

357
00:26:01,225 --> 00:26:03,159
a little bit jumbled up
and jivey,

358
00:26:03,227 --> 00:26:05,161
sing mares eat oats and does eat oats
and little lambs eat ivy.

359
00:26:05,229 --> 00:26:07,789
Ivy, ivy? Who's Ivy?
I've... I, l...

360
00:26:07,864 --> 00:26:11,061
For I'm the Lord Jesus
come again in my own body...

361
00:26:11,134 --> 00:26:14,797
to heal the sick,
the troubled and the ignorant.

362
00:26:14,871 --> 00:26:18,705
I am he that liveth, and behold,
I am alive for everyone.

363
00:26:18,775 --> 00:26:21,835
Is everybody happy?
Now hear this.

364
00:26:21,912 --> 00:26:24,710
I come to proclaim
the new dispensation.

365
00:26:24,781 --> 00:26:27,511
The gospel dispensation promised
only salvation to the soul.

366
00:26:27,584 --> 00:26:30,212
The new dispensation
gives it to the body as well.

367
00:26:30,287 --> 00:26:32,687
Jesus Christ... Mark l...
suffered to redeem the spirit...

368
00:26:32,756 --> 00:26:34,747
to let the body
separate it from God.

369
00:26:34,825 --> 00:26:38,022
So Satan found the place in man
and formed in him a false love,
a love of self.

370
00:26:38,095 --> 00:26:41,189
Explode! Only feel.

371
00:26:41,265 --> 00:26:43,699
Love can sin no more.

372
00:26:43,767 --> 00:26:48,397
Most anything you touch,
see and feel glorifies my love.

373
00:26:48,472 --> 00:26:53,205
Top hat is my miter,
and the walking stick my rod.

374
00:26:55,145 --> 00:26:57,170
Oh, dear.

375
00:26:58,749 --> 00:27:02,048
Once I get started, it's...
it's terribly difficult to stop.

376
00:27:02,119 --> 00:27:04,212
<i>- I'm so sorry.
- No, no, no, no.</i>

377
00:27:04,288 --> 00:27:07,485
It's fascinating.
How do you know you're God?

378
00:27:07,557 --> 00:27:11,152
Simple. When I pray to Him,
I find I'm talking to myself.

379
00:27:11,228 --> 00:27:13,423
I see. Well,
how did it happen?

380
00:27:13,497 --> 00:27:16,227
How did you come
to be in this state of grace?

381
00:27:16,300 --> 00:27:20,031
Like every prophet, I saw
visions, heard voices, I ran.

382
00:27:20,103 --> 00:27:23,539
The voices of St. Francis, Socrates,
General Gordon and Timothy O'Leary...

383
00:27:23,607 --> 00:27:25,541
all told me I was God.

384
00:27:25,609 --> 00:27:28,669
It was Sunday,
August 25, at 3:32.

385
00:27:28,745 --> 00:27:31,680
I heard a terrible thunderclap
and saw a body of light...

386
00:27:31,748 --> 00:27:34,808
like the light from the sun
and red as fire.

387
00:27:34,885 --> 00:27:38,286
I cried, "Hallelujah, Lord.
What will You do?"

388
00:27:38,355 --> 00:27:40,346
And the light vanished.

389
00:27:40,424 --> 00:27:43,450
Blackness and darkness...

390
00:27:43,527 --> 00:27:47,861
until a great brush dipped
in light swept across the sky,

391
00:27:47,931 --> 00:27:50,832
and I saw the diversity,
distinction and variety...

392
00:27:50,901 --> 00:27:54,166
all clearly rolled up
into the unity...

393
00:27:54,237 --> 00:27:56,364
of universal love.

394
00:27:56,440 --> 00:28:00,467
- Where did all this happen?
- East Acton, outside the public urinal.

395
00:28:02,679 --> 00:28:05,648
What does it feel like to be God?

396
00:28:05,716 --> 00:28:07,946
Like a river flowing everywhere.

397
00:28:08,018 --> 00:28:10,111
I pick up a newspaper,
and I'm everywhere...

398
00:28:10,187 --> 00:28:13,554
conducting a summit conference,
dying of hunger in a Peruvian gutter,

399
00:28:13,623 --> 00:28:16,615
accepting the Nobel Prize
for literature, raping a nun in Sumatra.

400
00:28:16,693 --> 00:28:21,027
Under this protective outer shell...

401
00:28:21,098 --> 00:28:23,566
I'm God-filled.

402
00:28:26,970 --> 00:28:29,461
Your Lordship, Sir Cha...
One moment.

403
00:28:29,539 --> 00:28:31,734
- What the...
- I haven't finished yet.

404
00:28:31,808 --> 00:28:33,742
Sir Charles Gurney, my lord.

405
00:28:33,810 --> 00:28:38,144
- Insolent clown.
- I heard that, Sir Charles.

406
00:28:38,215 --> 00:28:40,979
The world's gone mad.
He'll have to go.

407
00:28:41,051 --> 00:28:44,316
Hadn't we better wait? Somebody new
mightn't understand the situation.

408
00:28:44,388 --> 00:28:46,686
Why is he hanging on
with 30,000 in the bank?

409
00:28:46,757 --> 00:28:50,318
- Out of love.
- Love? Tucker? Rot.

410
00:28:50,394 --> 00:28:53,158
There are certain matters to do
with the estate that need clearing up.

411
00:28:53,230 --> 00:28:55,494
Nothing important.
Just need your signature.

412
00:28:55,565 --> 00:28:58,329
- Gives me power to handle odd things.
- Of course, Uncle.

413
00:28:58,402 --> 00:29:00,529
There's no need to read it.
Just take my word.

414
00:29:00,604 --> 00:29:03,038
I take your word. I put on
my glasses because I feel cold.

415
00:29:03,106 --> 00:29:05,267
- Where do I sign?
- Just there.

416
00:29:07,344 --> 00:29:09,869
Excellent, excellent.
Easily done, eh?

417
00:29:09,946 --> 00:29:13,143
"I, the undersigned,
Mycroft Holmes"?

418
00:29:13,216 --> 00:29:15,116
Who's Mycroft Holmes?

419
00:29:15,185 --> 00:29:17,653
Brother of Sherlock Holmes,
you illiterate oaf.

420
00:29:17,721 --> 00:29:20,554
- But your name's Jack.
- Never call me that!

421
00:29:20,624 --> 00:29:24,025
Jack's a word
I reject absolutely.

422
00:29:24,094 --> 00:29:26,688
It's a word I put into
my galvanized pressure cooker.

423
00:29:26,763 --> 00:29:28,788
Whreeep! Jack's dead.

424
00:29:28,865 --> 00:29:33,029
All right, all right.
What should we call you then?

425
00:29:33,103 --> 00:29:35,731
Any of the nine billion
names of God...

426
00:29:35,806 --> 00:29:39,298
Your Lordship will do, orJ.C.,
Eric, Bert, Barney Entwistle.

427
00:29:39,376 --> 00:29:41,401
I know exactly who I am.

428
00:29:41,478 --> 00:29:44,470
- You asked for these, my lord.
- Burn them, Mr. Tucker, burn them.

429
00:29:44,548 --> 00:29:47,574
<i>But great Scott, man.
These are your coronation robes.</i>

430
00:29:47,651 --> 00:29:49,585
A lot of tradition here, my lord.

431
00:29:49,653 --> 00:29:52,383
The axe must be laid
to the root, Uncle Charles.

432
00:29:52,456 --> 00:29:56,051
Pride and riches, pomp and property,
all must be locked off.

433
00:29:56,126 --> 00:29:58,788
Love makes all men equal.

434
00:29:58,862 --> 00:30:01,387
I love you dearly, Uncle Charles.

435
00:30:02,666 --> 00:30:05,464
Keep them,
if you feel so lost.

436
00:30:05,535 --> 00:30:08,732
Join me in a constitutional
before lunch, Mr. Tucker?

437
00:30:12,142 --> 00:30:16,203
Enjoy yourselves while I'm gone.
Relax. Have sex.

438
00:30:18,615 --> 00:30:21,413
My God!

439
00:30:21,485 --> 00:30:23,419
Yes?

440
00:30:23,487 --> 00:30:25,580
No, no, no. Nothing.

441
00:30:27,858 --> 00:30:31,419
Well? You heard
what he said, Charles.

442
00:30:31,495 --> 00:30:33,429
I did.

443
00:30:33,497 --> 00:30:35,590
Destroying property.
All men are equal.

444
00:30:35,665 --> 00:30:37,929
Do you know what
this means, Claire?

445
00:30:38,001 --> 00:30:40,469
He's not only mad, he's Bolshie!

446
00:30:42,405 --> 00:30:46,774
Smell the soul dust from
the lawns and hedgerows.

447
00:30:46,843 --> 00:30:49,971
Oh, what a beautiful day I've made.

448
00:30:50,046 --> 00:30:53,447
Look. Soft thistle and nigella.

449
00:30:53,517 --> 00:30:56,452
What?

450
00:30:56,520 --> 00:30:59,114
No water in days? Sorry.

451
00:30:59,189 --> 00:31:01,555
Can't think of everything.
I'll see to it.

452
00:31:05,529 --> 00:31:09,465
Remember the Sunday
picnics, Mr. Tucker?

453
00:31:09,533 --> 00:31:13,526
The world was all top hats
and white lace.

454
00:31:13,603 --> 00:31:16,538
And the best heavy silverware.

455
00:31:16,606 --> 00:31:20,599
- A snort, Your Lordship?
- Thank you.

456
00:31:20,677 --> 00:31:23,874
If only I knew then who I was now.

457
00:31:25,882 --> 00:31:28,146
Mmm, Mr. Grasshopper.

458
00:31:28,218 --> 00:31:30,413
Of course I bless you, you cherub,

459
00:31:30,487 --> 00:31:33,183
along with J. Edgar Hoover.

460
00:31:33,256 --> 00:31:38,193
This is the first chance I've had
of speaking to you alone.

461
00:31:38,261 --> 00:31:42,288
- Be on your guard, sir.
- You puzzle me, Mr. Tucker.

462
00:31:42,365 --> 00:31:45,698
The family...
I've seen them at work before.

463
00:31:45,769 --> 00:31:49,398
They got the power.
They make the rules.

464
00:31:49,472 --> 00:31:52,441
Back there, they're plotting
against you like mad.

465
00:31:52,509 --> 00:31:56,001
Love cannot doubt
nor faith the mustard seed.

466
00:31:56,079 --> 00:31:59,105
"Plotting" is a word I put into
my galvanized pressure cooker.

467
00:31:59,182 --> 00:32:01,173
Vroooom! It's gone.

468
00:32:02,786 --> 00:32:07,120
Feeling persecuted is one of the signs
of paranoid schizophrenia.

469
00:32:07,190 --> 00:32:10,956
Many poor wretches in Dr. Herder's
dancing academy suffered from same.

470
00:32:11,027 --> 00:32:15,862
"I am being watched," they said.
"Everybody is against me," they cried.

471
00:32:15,932 --> 00:32:19,595
You've set up profound negative
reactions with your Kremlin plots.

472
00:32:19,669 --> 00:32:21,603
I'm leaving you.

473
00:32:23,139 --> 00:32:27,098
Resist it, Mr. Tucker.
That way madness lies.

474
00:32:29,446 --> 00:32:33,746
<i>That's the thanks you get.
He's the same as all the rest.</i>

475
00:32:33,817 --> 00:32:36,786
<i>What he doesn't want to be so
just isn't so.</i>

476
00:32:36,853 --> 00:32:40,220
<i>No skin off my nose.
My 30,000's safe.</i>

477
00:32:40,290 --> 00:32:42,690
<i>And I deserve
every last penny of it.</i>

478
00:32:42,759 --> 00:32:45,159
<i>And more, and more and more!</i>

479
00:32:45,228 --> 00:32:49,665
<i>What's keeping you then, Dan?
Be honest now, Daniel.</i>

480
00:32:49,733 --> 00:32:52,566
<i>Fear. Fear and habit.</i>

481
00:32:52,636 --> 00:32:54,900
<i>You get into the habit of serving.</i>

482
00:32:54,971 --> 00:32:57,132
<i>Born a servant, see.
Son of a servant.</i>

483
00:32:57,207 --> 00:32:59,732
<i>Family of servants.
From a nation of servants!</i>

484
00:32:59,809 --> 00:33:03,973
<i>The first thing an Englishman does,
straight from his mother's womb,
is touch his forelock.</i>

485
00:33:04,047 --> 00:33:07,039
<i>That's how they can tell
the wrinkled little bastard's English.</i>

486
00:33:07,117 --> 00:33:09,051
<i>They don't know about me.</i>

487
00:33:09,119 --> 00:33:11,815
<i>A lot they don't know
about Daniel Tucker.</i>

488
00:33:11,888 --> 00:33:14,880
<i>Just old faithful Tucker.
Give doggie boney.</i>

489
00:33:14,958 --> 00:33:18,917
<i>You know who I really am?
Alexei Kronstadt.</i>

490
00:33:18,995 --> 00:33:23,193
<i>Anarchist, Trotskyist, Communist,
revolutionary. I'm a cell!</i>

491
00:33:23,266 --> 00:33:26,360
For years I've been working
for the revolution.

492
00:33:26,436 --> 00:33:29,269
Spitting in the ox soup.

493
00:33:29,339 --> 00:33:31,773
Peeing on the Wedgewood plates.

494
00:33:33,610 --> 00:33:38,104
# So raise the scarlet banner high #

495
00:33:38,181 --> 00:33:42,550
# Beneath its shade we live and die ##

496
00:33:45,055 --> 00:33:46,989
J.C.!

497
00:33:47,057 --> 00:33:49,787
Bert!

498
00:33:49,859 --> 00:33:51,793
My lord!

499
00:33:51,861 --> 00:33:54,091
<i>Barney Entwistle.</i>

500
00:33:54,164 --> 00:33:57,793
- Tea, madame?
- Oh, uh, yes.

501
00:33:57,867 --> 00:34:01,633
Tucker, what was that song
you were singing last night?

502
00:34:03,273 --> 00:34:05,969
An old German hymn, madame.

503
00:34:06,042 --> 00:34:07,976
"Tannenbaum."

504
00:34:09,279 --> 00:34:11,247
Milk or lemon?

505
00:34:11,314 --> 00:34:13,248
Lemon.

506
00:34:13,316 --> 00:34:17,184
I say, where is the guv'nor?
Ah, is that tea, Tucker? Just the job.

507
00:34:17,253 --> 00:34:20,120
He's in town, trying to find
a way around this mess.

508
00:34:20,190 --> 00:34:22,317
- When's he back?
- Oh, any time now...

509
00:34:22,392 --> 00:34:24,656
if he doesn't drop in
on his mistress first.

510
00:34:24,728 --> 00:34:28,164
Hope he gets things sorted out soon.
It's getting damned awkward
in the village.

511
00:34:28,231 --> 00:34:31,166
- Awkward?
- Well, they expect us Gurneys
to be in everything.

512
00:34:31,234 --> 00:34:34,328
Mrs. Piggot-Jones and Mrs. Treadwell
and all the other old girls,

513
00:34:34,404 --> 00:34:38,704
they thought it would be
a splendid idea if the new earl
was to open the fete on Sunday.

514
00:34:38,775 --> 00:34:42,541
I hardly dare ask, but naturally
you told them it would be impossible?

515
00:34:42,612 --> 00:34:45,581
<i>- Milk or lemon?
- Lemon, please, Tucker.</i>

516
00:34:45,648 --> 00:34:49,175
Yes, but, you see,
I am the prospective parliamentary
candidate for the division,

517
00:34:49,252 --> 00:34:51,243
and I have to watch
my step with them.

518
00:34:51,321 --> 00:34:54,722
I couldn't very well say that
he was "non-compis," could I?

519
00:34:54,791 --> 00:34:58,192
- Well, where is he now?
- Up there.

520
00:34:58,261 --> 00:35:01,697
Look what you've done.

521
00:35:01,765 --> 00:35:05,360
Never get tea stains out.
Show some consideration.

522
00:35:05,435 --> 00:35:09,633
- He... It's yogi, isn't it?
- Tea, my lord?

523
00:35:09,706 --> 00:35:13,198
It's no use, Tucker. I've tried.
He's asleep. Dead to the world.

524
00:35:13,276 --> 00:35:17,372
His body sleeps, but his
divinity is always watching.

525
00:35:17,447 --> 00:35:19,540
Milk, please.
Any toasted muffin?

526
00:35:19,616 --> 00:35:21,550
Yes.

527
00:35:21,618 --> 00:35:24,052
- Shall I bring 'em up?
- No, I'll be right down.

528
00:35:24,120 --> 00:35:26,554
It is yogi, isn't it?
Or a form of yogi?

529
00:35:26,623 --> 00:35:29,057
Don't give me another
headache, Dinsdale.

530
00:35:29,125 --> 00:35:32,026
You look ill, Mr. Tucker.

531
00:35:32,095 --> 00:35:35,292
Bed, Mr. Tucker, right now.

532
00:35:35,365 --> 00:35:37,560
Thank you, my lord.

533
00:35:39,302 --> 00:35:41,862
Welcome, Dinsdale.

534
00:35:41,938 --> 00:35:45,874
Yes. I mean, how are you?

535
00:35:45,942 --> 00:35:50,572
Sometimes my spirits sink below
the high water mark in Palestine,

536
00:35:50,647 --> 00:35:52,740
but I'm adjusting gradually.

537
00:35:52,816 --> 00:35:57,219
For what I am about to receive,
may I make myself truly thankful.

538
00:35:59,055 --> 00:36:01,023
Soon I must be moving on.

539
00:36:01,090 --> 00:36:05,823
Sail away, Lalaha, New Jersey,
Port Said and Crewe.

540
00:36:05,895 --> 00:36:09,353
First, I shall command the Pope
to consecrate a planeload
of contraceptives...

541
00:36:09,432 --> 00:36:11,366
for the priest-ridden Irish.

542
00:36:16,105 --> 00:36:20,166
Arise, shine,
for my light is come...

543
00:36:20,243 --> 00:36:23,804
and the glory of the Lord
is risen upon thee.

544
00:36:23,880 --> 00:36:26,906
# Here is the rag
See how it goes #

545
00:36:26,983 --> 00:36:29,451
# Down on your heels
Up on your toes #

546
00:36:29,519 --> 00:36:32,920
#That's the way to do
the varsity drag #

547
00:36:34,123 --> 00:36:37,024
Piggot-Jones and Mrs. Treadwell.

548
00:36:37,093 --> 00:36:41,792
#You can pass many a class
whether you're dumb or wise #

549
00:36:41,865 --> 00:36:46,029
# If you all answer the call
when your professor cries #

550
00:36:46,102 --> 00:36:49,367
- Everybody!
- # Down on the heels, up on the toes #

551
00:36:49,439 --> 00:36:51,999
# Stay after school
Learn how it goes #

552
00:36:52,075 --> 00:36:54,543
# Everybody do the varsity #

553
00:36:54,611 --> 00:36:56,841
# Everybody do the varsity
Everybody do the varsity #

554
00:36:56,913 --> 00:37:00,849
# Everybody do the varsity drag ##

555
00:37:00,917 --> 00:37:03,977
Welcome, ladies.
I'm the new lord.

556
00:37:04,053 --> 00:37:08,513
- You know Lady Claire
and my cousin Dinsdale.

557
00:37:08,591 --> 00:37:10,786
Oh, ladies, this is a surprise.

558
00:37:10,860 --> 00:37:13,727
But delightful,
really delightful.

559
00:37:13,796 --> 00:37:16,526
Dear Sir Dinsdale,
do forgive us for dropping in.

560
00:37:16,599 --> 00:37:20,558
We thought we'd just take a stroll
out to the manor. It's only six miles.

561
00:37:20,637 --> 00:37:25,199
We've come to try to persuade His
Lordship to open our little church fete.

562
00:37:25,275 --> 00:37:27,209
<i>Do say yes, my lord.</i>

563
00:37:27,277 --> 00:37:29,370
I always say yes,
whatever question.

564
00:37:29,445 --> 00:37:31,072
How splendid!

565
00:37:31,147 --> 00:37:33,741
If you'll excuse us,
we have a lot to do.

566
00:37:33,816 --> 00:37:36,250
Stay to tea.
You be mother.

567
00:37:38,855 --> 00:37:41,449
Go and see if your father's back.

568
00:37:41,524 --> 00:37:44,459
Tell me, ladies, what do I do
at this gala opening of yours?

569
00:37:44,527 --> 00:37:48,224
Do I charm bracelets, swing
lead, break wind, pass water?

570
00:37:48,298 --> 00:37:50,528
Yes... No!

571
00:37:50,600 --> 00:37:53,160
You'll make a speech.

572
00:37:53,236 --> 00:37:55,534
On what text, Mother Superior?

573
00:37:55,605 --> 00:37:58,369
Oh, we leave that to the speaker.

574
00:37:58,441 --> 00:38:01,035
It can be any topic
of current interest:

575
00:38:01,110 --> 00:38:04,307
Hanging, immigration
or the stranglehold of the unions.

576
00:38:04,380 --> 00:38:08,578
But I've always felt the speeches should
be about Britain and our way of life.

577
00:38:08,651 --> 00:38:10,585
- Britain?
- Mm-hmm.

578
00:38:10,653 --> 00:38:13,144
A fly-blown speck in the North Sea.

579
00:38:13,222 --> 00:38:17,556
You can't kick the natives
in the back streets of Calcutta anymore.

580
00:38:17,627 --> 00:38:22,223
Oh, he's joking again.
Aren't you, my lord?

581
00:38:22,298 --> 00:38:25,893
I'm not laughing, Pamela,
and we can't stay here, Lady Claire.

582
00:38:25,969 --> 00:38:28,802
- Then for Christ's sake, go.
- Oh, don't go for my sake.

583
00:38:28,871 --> 00:38:32,102
Oh. Delicious. Homegrown?

584
00:38:32,175 --> 00:38:34,405
No, I bought them.
I mean, they go with...

585
00:38:34,477 --> 00:38:38,573
Ladies, I've decided to begin
my second ministry at your gathering.

586
00:38:38,648 --> 00:38:43,108
Last time I preached the Word in holy
Galilee, I spoke in parables. Mistake!

587
00:38:43,186 --> 00:38:45,620
Now I must speak plain.
God is love.

588
00:38:45,688 --> 00:38:47,053
<i>- Love?
- Love.</i>

589
00:38:47,123 --> 00:38:49,057
As water is wet, as jade is hard,

590
00:38:49,125 --> 00:38:51,753
as bread is life, so God is love.

591
00:38:51,828 --> 00:38:54,422
Mrs. Pamela Treadwell, can you love?

592
00:38:54,497 --> 00:38:57,898
<i>Can your blood bubble, flesh melt,
thighs twitch, heart burst for love?</i>

593
00:38:57,967 --> 00:38:59,491
Your Lordship, I'm a married woman...

594
00:38:59,569 --> 00:39:02,629
Remember the commandment I gave you:
"Love one another as I love you."

595
00:39:02,705 --> 00:39:06,300
Stay back. My husband
is a master of hounds.

596
00:39:06,376 --> 00:39:10,710
Fill your hearts! Let your souls
dance, your eyes sparkle!

597
00:39:10,780 --> 00:39:13,078
Be bird happy!

598
00:39:13,149 --> 00:39:16,414
<i>- Oh, what is it?
- A Watusi walking stick.</i>

599
00:39:16,486 --> 00:39:19,387
Big people, the Watusi.

600
00:39:19,455 --> 00:39:22,822
Ladies, come back.
I'll fill your bodies.

601
00:39:22,892 --> 00:39:26,953
- Oh, I'm awfully sorry.
Have you seen my father?

602
00:39:27,030 --> 00:39:30,363
I am and the resurrection
and the light!

603
00:39:32,668 --> 00:39:34,795
Will you kindly stop?

604
00:39:44,147 --> 00:39:48,174
What are those two doing here?
Who's the idiot responsible?

605
00:39:48,251 --> 00:39:50,879
Oh, Dinsdale, of course.
Who else?

606
00:39:50,953 --> 00:39:53,478
You'll have to do something
about that boy.

607
00:39:53,556 --> 00:39:55,490
Well, he'll soon be off our hands.

608
00:39:55,558 --> 00:39:58,584
Old Barrington-Cochran's on his last
legs. That'll mean a by-election.

609
00:39:58,661 --> 00:40:01,323
Well, what about Mrs. Piggot-Jones?
Mrs. Treadwell?

610
00:40:01,397 --> 00:40:05,299
Oh, they'll say the new earl's
eccentric or something.
Better still, heavy drinker.

611
00:40:05,368 --> 00:40:07,928
Be not afraid! It is I!

612
00:40:08,004 --> 00:40:10,495
But,J.C., look,
I know who you are.

613
00:40:10,573 --> 00:40:15,010
But maybe they don't.
And we... I mean, that is, us...

614
00:40:15,078 --> 00:40:17,478
Oh, let's go and have
a glass of sherry.

615
00:40:19,715 --> 00:40:22,513
Well?
What did Sir Humphrey say?

616
00:40:22,585 --> 00:40:25,349
Oh, he gave me a lot of expensive
legal "fal-de-roll."

617
00:40:25,421 --> 00:40:28,185
But as things stand,
there's no way of breaking the will.

618
00:40:28,257 --> 00:40:31,317
- So?
- There's only one possible solution.

619
00:40:31,394 --> 00:40:34,056
<i>- A male heir.
- A what!</i>

620
00:40:34,130 --> 00:40:38,066
Well, ifJack had a son, Sir Humphrey
says we could easily get him certified.

621
00:40:38,134 --> 00:40:40,659
Because then, everything
would pass to the heir.

622
00:40:40,736 --> 00:40:43,637
We could manage the estate
till the boy came of age,

623
00:40:43,706 --> 00:40:45,697
and that way everything
would remain in the family.

624
00:40:45,775 --> 00:40:48,209
Oh, brilliant.
A small point.

625
00:40:48,277 --> 00:40:51,713
But before he can have an heir,
our lunatic nephew has to be married.

626
00:40:51,781 --> 00:40:54,579
Exactly.
And the sooner the better.

627
00:40:56,819 --> 00:41:01,756
Yes, but don't you understand
that these two ladies
are extremely important to me?

628
00:41:01,824 --> 00:41:05,225
Well, I sincerely hope, Jack, that
when they next come down to the manor,

629
00:41:05,294 --> 00:41:07,228
you'll be a trifle more courteous.

630
00:41:07,296 --> 00:41:10,891
- Now, be subtle.
- Oh, right.

631
00:41:13,803 --> 00:41:16,704
<i>Ah, we were just talking
about you and marriage.</i>

632
00:41:16,772 --> 00:41:19,798
<i>- We think you should take a wife.
- Who from?</i>

633
00:41:19,876 --> 00:41:22,868
I'm sure we can find you
a suitable young goddess.

634
00:41:22,945 --> 00:41:25,880
What?
Oh, most appropriate, eh?

635
00:41:25,948 --> 00:41:28,974
- I can't marry a second time.
- You're already married?

636
00:41:29,051 --> 00:41:32,487
August 28th
in the year of me, 1964.

637
00:41:32,555 --> 00:41:35,251
This wife of yours...
What's her name?

638
00:41:35,324 --> 00:41:37,986
<i>- Marguerite Gauthier.
- French?</i>

639
00:41:38,060 --> 00:41:40,824
- Yes.
- Gauthier. Marguerite Gauthier.

640
00:41:40,897 --> 00:41:42,831
Isn't that
"The Lady of the Camellias"?

641
00:41:42,899 --> 00:41:44,958
You knew her too?
Wonderful.

642
00:41:45,034 --> 00:41:47,264
And that's the tune, isn't it?

643
00:41:50,806 --> 00:41:53,969
Naturally I came as soon as I could.

644
00:41:54,043 --> 00:41:56,102
We do appreciate it.

645
00:42:01,317 --> 00:42:04,286
<i>Your nephew is not married
to the Lady of the Camellias.</i>

646
00:42:04,353 --> 00:42:08,016
He has no wife. But he believes
he has, which is the same thing.

647
00:42:08,090 --> 00:42:10,684
Why did he pick on
Marguerite Gauthier?

648
00:42:10,760 --> 00:42:12,694
Another martyr for love.

649
00:42:21,370 --> 00:42:23,770
His delusions are all of a piece.

650
00:42:23,839 --> 00:42:26,171
Marguerite is the only
person he trusts.

651
00:42:27,910 --> 00:42:30,606
Why does he keep on about love?

652
00:42:32,915 --> 00:42:35,645
Because he wants us
all to love goodness.

653
00:42:35,718 --> 00:42:37,811
To love goodness is to love God.

654
00:42:37,887 --> 00:42:40,879
To love God is to love
the 14th Earl of Gurney.

655
00:42:40,957 --> 00:42:44,154
That's very clever,
but is it the truth?

656
00:42:44,227 --> 00:42:48,061
Ah, don't come to me
for the truth, only explanations.

657
00:42:48,130 --> 00:42:50,121
Can I ask you one more question?

658
00:42:51,901 --> 00:42:53,892
If it's as revealing as the others.

659
00:42:55,938 --> 00:42:58,372
Why does he hate being called Jack?

660
00:42:58,441 --> 00:43:00,466
Because it's his real name.

661
00:43:00,543 --> 00:43:03,171
Naturally he rejects it violently.

662
00:43:03,246 --> 00:43:06,181
If ever he answers
to the name ofJack,

663
00:43:06,249 --> 00:43:09,241
then you know he's
on the road to sanity.

664
00:43:17,593 --> 00:43:20,892
Doctor, how are my questions
revealing?

665
00:43:20,963 --> 00:43:23,830
The first one you asked me
was about love.

666
00:43:30,906 --> 00:43:35,070
<i>This is our Tucker, Dr. Herder.
He's been with the family for 40 years.</i>

667
00:43:35,144 --> 00:43:37,704
Man and sniveling boy, sir.

668
00:43:37,780 --> 00:43:40,374
How do you find
the new earl, Tucker?

669
00:43:40,449 --> 00:43:43,509
By sniffing. He's a Gurney.

670
00:43:43,586 --> 00:43:45,554
A real Gurney.

671
00:43:45,621 --> 00:43:48,385
You don't find him odd?

672
00:43:48,457 --> 00:43:50,391
Odd?

673
00:43:51,460 --> 00:43:53,951
- Soda?
- Yes.

674
00:43:54,030 --> 00:43:57,158
Yes, odd, peculiar.

675
00:43:57,233 --> 00:44:00,168
Oh, you mean nutty?

676
00:44:00,236 --> 00:44:02,636
Yes, he's a nutcase.

677
00:44:02,705 --> 00:44:05,469
Most of these titled fleabags are.

678
00:44:05,541 --> 00:44:08,908
Rich nobs and priveleged arseholes
can afford to be bonkers.

679
00:44:08,978 --> 00:44:11,310
They're living in a dreamworld,
aren't they, sir?

680
00:44:11,380 --> 00:44:13,439
Life's made too easy for 'em.

681
00:44:13,516 --> 00:44:17,680
They don't have to earn a livin',
so they do just what they want to.

682
00:44:17,753 --> 00:44:22,952
We'd all be pretty crackers
if we went around doing just
what we wanted to, wouldn't we?

683
00:44:23,025 --> 00:44:24,959
- Eh?
- Yes.

684
00:44:26,095 --> 00:44:28,029
Yes, I suppose...

685
00:44:28,097 --> 00:44:31,066
The late earl
left Tucker £30,000.

686
00:44:31,133 --> 00:44:34,762
Since then, he's been very outspoken.

687
00:44:34,837 --> 00:44:36,771
Lady?

688
00:44:36,839 --> 00:44:39,273
No, thank you.

689
00:44:39,342 --> 00:44:41,833
Waste not, want not.

690
00:44:46,182 --> 00:44:48,946
Mind having a look at my back, Doctor?

691
00:44:49,018 --> 00:44:51,248
Lumbago acting up again.

692
00:44:51,320 --> 00:44:54,778
<i>Lady of the Camellias
by Alexandre Dumas.</i>

693
00:44:54,857 --> 00:44:56,984
<i>Camille.</i>

694
00:44:57,059 --> 00:44:59,857
<i>It's La Traviata,
the opera by Verdi.</i>

695
00:44:59,929 --> 00:45:03,888
It's all the same woman: Marguerite
Gauthier, a figure of romance.

696
00:45:03,966 --> 00:45:08,403
My dear chap, you've proved my point
ipso facto. A divine figure of romance.

697
00:45:08,471 --> 00:45:10,405
Yeah.

698
00:45:10,473 --> 00:45:13,636
- Well, what a pleasant surprise.
- How are you?

699
00:45:13,709 --> 00:45:16,803
In the middle of a debate
on the existence of my wife, Marguerite.

700
00:45:16,879 --> 00:45:19,973
- Pray continue, Dinsdale Gurney.
- I give up.

701
00:45:20,049 --> 00:45:23,212
You did say it'd be impossible
to convince him, Doctor.

702
00:45:23,285 --> 00:45:26,277
<i>Do you see? It's a play.
The Lady of the Camellias.</i>

703
00:45:26,355 --> 00:45:29,290
- It's fiction.
- It's a biography of my Marguerite,

704
00:45:29,358 --> 00:45:31,690
<i>affectionately known
as La Dame aux Camellias.</i>

705
00:45:31,761 --> 00:45:34,025
You aren't married.
The woman doesn't exist.

706
00:45:34,096 --> 00:45:38,294
Oh, come on! You'll be saying I'm not
God, Christ and the Holy Ghost next!

707
00:45:38,367 --> 00:45:42,497
Well, you're not. I mean, God
wouldn't be so ridiculous waving
his arms around like a maniac,

708
00:45:42,571 --> 00:45:45,597
dressed in a white suit
and a red carnation.

709
00:45:45,674 --> 00:45:50,611
The prophet Ezekiel lay 300 days on his
left side and 40 days on his right.

710
00:45:50,679 --> 00:45:54,308
He cut his hair and divided it in three
parts. The first part he burnt,

711
00:45:54,383 --> 00:45:58,251
the second he chopped into pieces,
the third he scattered to the wind.

712
00:45:58,320 --> 00:46:00,788
It was all a sign
of something more important.

713
00:46:00,856 --> 00:46:04,223
All right, if you're God,
reveal your godhead.

714
00:46:04,293 --> 00:46:06,227
No, no, no, no.

715
00:46:06,295 --> 00:46:08,593
A miracle.
Show us a miracle.

716
00:46:08,664 --> 00:46:11,132
- Here's a miracle.
- What?

717
00:46:11,200 --> 00:46:13,760
This hand...

718
00:46:13,836 --> 00:46:16,999
this city network of tissues,
nerves, muscles, ligaments,

719
00:46:17,072 --> 00:46:19,666
carpals and metacarpals,
phalanges.

720
00:46:19,742 --> 00:46:21,937
And what about
the hairy-nosed wombat?

721
00:46:22,011 --> 00:46:23,945
I don't mean
that sort of miracle.

722
00:46:24,013 --> 00:46:26,880
I mean a proper miracle
like the loaves and the fishes.

723
00:46:26,949 --> 00:46:28,883
Oh, those.

724
00:46:28,951 --> 00:46:32,512
You see ten billion million
miracles a day,

725
00:46:32,588 --> 00:46:35,921
yet you want your conjuring tricks,
your pretty flimflams.

726
00:46:35,991 --> 00:46:38,824
Well, I can't raise Lazarus again.
He's decomposed.

727
00:46:38,894 --> 00:46:42,022
- So bring me that table.
- What are you going to do?

728
00:46:42,097 --> 00:46:45,260
A grade-one Galilee miracle.

729
00:46:50,139 --> 00:46:54,735
Now, instead of raising Lazarus,

730
00:46:54,810 --> 00:46:56,869
I'll raise you a table.

731
00:46:56,946 --> 00:46:59,744
- What? That table?
- Ten feet.

732
00:46:59,815 --> 00:47:04,411
Not with the aid of mirrors or
crippled midgets behind black curtains,

733
00:47:04,487 --> 00:47:06,580
but by the power of love.

734
00:47:06,655 --> 00:47:08,748
- Just love?
- It moves mountains...

735
00:47:08,824 --> 00:47:12,225
and makes the puny weed
split the rock.

736
00:47:17,833 --> 00:47:20,233
Believe in me.

737
00:47:20,302 --> 00:47:22,600
In loving goodness.

738
00:47:23,839 --> 00:47:25,898
Raise yourself up.

739
00:47:33,115 --> 00:47:35,948
Rise up.

740
00:47:36,018 --> 00:47:39,977
Slowly... slowly...

741
00:47:40,055 --> 00:47:41,989
rise up.

742
00:47:43,592 --> 00:47:47,426
One foot... two...

743
00:47:47,496 --> 00:47:51,398
three... four.

744
00:47:51,467 --> 00:47:55,198
Slowly... slowly.

745
00:47:55,271 --> 00:47:58,866
Five... six...

746
00:47:58,941 --> 00:48:02,377
<i>seven... eight...</i>

747
00:48:02,444 --> 00:48:04,878
<i>nine, ten!</i>

748
00:48:04,947 --> 00:48:10,112
<i>There! The table floats
ten feet in space!</i>

749
00:48:10,185 --> 00:48:13,621
I see it!
It's a bloody miracle!

750
00:48:13,689 --> 00:48:15,987
- Drunken lout!
- It didn't rise. There it is.

751
00:48:17,760 --> 00:48:20,092
Tucker saw, believed!

752
00:48:20,162 --> 00:48:22,255
- Did you see it, Doctor?
- No.

753
00:48:22,331 --> 00:48:24,891
Into my galvanized
pressure cooker.

754
00:48:24,967 --> 00:48:28,164
There's no miracle.
There's no wife. She doesn't exist.

755
00:48:28,237 --> 00:48:30,501
<i>She's fiction. Part of a play,
part of an opera.</i>

756
00:48:30,573 --> 00:48:33,337
<i>She's not flesh and blood.
She's not real.</i>

757
00:49:05,774 --> 00:49:07,366
Marguerite.

758
00:50:30,492 --> 00:50:32,892
How dare you bring that woman here!

759
00:50:32,961 --> 00:50:35,828
- You should be very grateful
to Miss Shelley.
- Grace Shelley is your mistress.

760
00:50:35,898 --> 00:50:38,628
- Miss Shelley
is just a hardworking girl.
- On her back.

761
00:50:38,701 --> 00:50:41,568
First you try and pawn her
off on your own brother.

762
00:50:41,637 --> 00:50:45,630
Ralph needed a wife.
He took a fancy to young Miss Shelley.

763
00:50:45,708 --> 00:50:49,804
Well, that didn't work, so you tried
her with the son. It's incestuous.

764
00:50:49,878 --> 00:50:53,439
Don't talk about incest, madam.
I remember yourJeremy Gore.

765
00:50:53,515 --> 00:50:56,848
You went to school with the father,
but you went ahead and seduced the son.

766
00:50:56,919 --> 00:50:59,945
- That is incest, madam.
- Ohhh.

767
00:51:00,022 --> 00:51:02,855
Well, why the hell
didn't you warn us?

768
00:51:02,925 --> 00:51:05,826
No time. After what
that "trick cyclist" told me,

769
00:51:05,894 --> 00:51:09,990
I knew we'd never
convinceJack he wasn't married
or that Marguerite didn't exist.

770
00:51:10,065 --> 00:51:12,329
So I telephoned Grace
and explained the position.

771
00:51:12,401 --> 00:51:15,165
She got hold of theatrical togs
and came down here.

772
00:51:15,237 --> 00:51:17,967
She put up
a first-rate show, I thought.

773
00:51:18,040 --> 00:51:19,974
Well, it had impact.

774
00:51:20,042 --> 00:51:22,670
Anyway, Jack believed
that she was Marguerite.

775
00:51:22,745 --> 00:51:26,408
All she has to do now is convince him
he has to marry her again.

776
00:51:26,482 --> 00:51:29,076
Dr. Herder is furious.

777
00:51:29,151 --> 00:51:32,814
Furious? He's got no right
to be furious. He's not family.

778
00:51:32,888 --> 00:51:37,382
He could make things difficult
by having Jack declared insane
before he's produced an heir.

779
00:51:37,459 --> 00:51:40,553
Damned Kraut. You'll have to keep
your eye on him, my dear.

780
00:51:40,629 --> 00:51:43,894
I'm gonna have me hands full
getting Grace married and pregnant.

781
00:51:43,966 --> 00:51:46,901
What an entrance!
Beautiful, but beautiful!

782
00:51:46,969 --> 00:51:49,233
The looks on your faces!

783
00:51:49,304 --> 00:51:52,705
<i>I should have stuck to the classics.
Always said I had the voice.</i>

784
00:51:52,775 --> 00:51:56,836
Oh, this dress is tight.
I feel constipated.

785
00:51:56,912 --> 00:51:59,847
Your flower is wilting, dear.

786
00:51:59,915 --> 00:52:02,008
Can't be. It's wax.

787
00:52:02,084 --> 00:52:04,951
Careful your husband-to-be
doesn't eat it for breakfast.

788
00:52:09,792 --> 00:52:13,057
You're right, Charlie boy.
She is an ice-cold biddy.

789
00:52:13,128 --> 00:52:15,596
Oh, she's too clever
by half, that woman.

790
00:52:15,664 --> 00:52:18,929
But I get things done my way.
She doesn't know what she wants.

791
00:52:19,001 --> 00:52:21,663
Oh, but I do, Charlie boy.

792
00:52:21,737 --> 00:52:25,434
Lady Grace.
Lady Grace Gurney,

793
00:52:25,507 --> 00:52:27,441
the countess of Gurney.

794
00:52:27,509 --> 00:52:30,273
Now, look here, Grace,
you mustn't call me Charlie boy.

795
00:52:30,345 --> 00:52:32,745
- We've gotta be careful.
- Oh, if that's what you want.

796
00:52:32,815 --> 00:52:35,443
Oh, it's not what I want.
It's what it has to be.

797
00:52:35,517 --> 00:52:37,781
Oh, I'm very fond of you, my dear.

798
00:52:37,853 --> 00:52:40,481
Yeah, well, you've a damned
funny way of showing it.

799
00:52:40,556 --> 00:52:43,184
First you push me into the arms
of your half-dead half brother,

800
00:52:43,258 --> 00:52:45,192
and then onto his loony son.

801
00:52:45,260 --> 00:52:48,127
Well, I'd make any sacrifice
for the sake of the family.

802
00:52:48,197 --> 00:52:50,597
Now, are you sure
you can handle the situation?

803
00:52:50,666 --> 00:52:53,897
Tricky and all, marrying
a man who thinks he's God.

804
00:52:53,969 --> 00:52:56,403
Happens all the time.

805
00:52:56,471 --> 00:53:00,464
Look, there he is.

806
00:53:00,542 --> 00:53:04,137
<i>Well, better get
the show on the road.</i>

807
00:53:04,213 --> 00:53:06,477
Oh, where's me lousy camellia?

808
00:53:12,387 --> 00:53:15,117
Oh, I'll be glad
to get out of this clobber.

809
00:53:15,190 --> 00:53:18,125
Oh! No wonder
she was dying of consumption.

810
00:53:21,663 --> 00:53:23,688
Now, be careful.

811
00:53:23,765 --> 00:53:27,098
Oh, don't worry, Charlie bo...
Charles.

812
00:53:27,169 --> 00:53:29,899
I've got too much at stake
to blow it.

813
00:53:37,079 --> 00:53:39,604
Damned plucky filly.

814
00:53:41,617 --> 00:53:43,983
I say, Father,
Mother's just told me...

815
00:53:44,052 --> 00:53:46,680
that this Lady of the Camellia
woman is just a fake.

816
00:53:46,755 --> 00:53:49,155
Well, I mean, I know thatJ.C.
Is as batty as a moorhen,

817
00:53:49,224 --> 00:53:51,385
but this just isn't
playing the game, sir.

818
00:53:51,460 --> 00:53:53,394
Game? What game?

819
00:53:53,462 --> 00:53:55,862
This is no game, sir.
This is real!

820
00:54:04,573 --> 00:54:07,337
My dream's made flesh.

821
00:54:16,618 --> 00:54:19,178
Sorry.
I don't speak French.

822
00:54:19,254 --> 00:54:22,621
Oh. German?
Italian? Yiddish?

823
00:54:22,691 --> 00:54:24,625
No. English.

824
00:54:24,693 --> 00:54:26,888
English?
Should have said so before.

825
00:54:26,962 --> 00:54:30,090
Nothing to be ashamed of.
Hard language to master.

826
00:54:30,165 --> 00:54:33,464
But we can't play this
love scene with mere words.

827
00:54:33,535 --> 00:54:35,969
Love scene? What, now?

828
00:54:36,038 --> 00:54:38,768
Love isn't just for one season.

829
00:54:38,840 --> 00:54:42,674
Tweet. Tweet.

830
00:54:42,744 --> 00:54:44,712
Tweet?

831
00:55:02,664 --> 00:55:04,598
Cuckoo.

832
00:55:49,011 --> 00:55:51,707
Anything you care for?
The Grand Canyon?

833
00:55:51,780 --> 00:55:54,305
A disused banana factory?
Absolution?

834
00:55:54,383 --> 00:55:56,613
- A white wedding.
- Will Tuesday suit you?

835
00:55:56,685 --> 00:55:59,483
- You deserve a big kiss.
- Not here in the garden.

836
00:55:59,554 --> 00:56:03,285
Last time I was kissed in a garden,
it turned out rather awkward.

837
00:56:03,358 --> 00:56:05,417
Oh, butJudas was a man.

838
00:56:05,494 --> 00:56:08,657
Yes. Strange business.

839
00:56:10,732 --> 00:56:13,667
- Who are you?
- A woman.

840
00:56:13,735 --> 00:56:15,760
Descended from Eve?

841
00:56:15,837 --> 00:56:18,135
No. Doorstep.
I'm an orphan.

842
00:56:18,206 --> 00:56:20,572
We'll be orphans
together, Marguerite.

843
00:56:20,642 --> 00:56:22,974
Call me Grace,
as I don't speak French.

844
00:56:23,045 --> 00:56:25,673
Grace. A good name.
It means "the gift of faith."

845
00:56:25,747 --> 00:56:28,648
And that's what I have in you.
I'm holding you to that wedding.

846
00:56:28,717 --> 00:56:31,652
Hold hard.
You'll be my queen of queens.

847
00:56:31,720 --> 00:56:34,655
I'll be satisfied with
"Lady Grace Gurney."

848
00:56:34,723 --> 00:56:38,921
And I say unto you, thou
shalt love the Lord thy God...

849
00:56:38,994 --> 00:56:43,397
with all thy heart and
all thy soul and all thy mind.

850
00:56:45,267 --> 00:56:47,201
I do.

851
00:56:48,403 --> 00:56:52,669
Oh, I'm happy.
I'm the sunshine man,

852
00:56:52,741 --> 00:56:55,039
the driver of the gravy train.

853
00:56:55,110 --> 00:56:57,374
Choo, choo, choo.

854
00:56:57,446 --> 00:56:59,539
It's so simple for me.

855
00:56:59,614 --> 00:57:01,980
Paradise is just a smiling face.

856
00:57:02,050 --> 00:57:05,349
- What's it for you?
- For me? Paradise?

857
00:57:05,420 --> 00:57:07,684
A fireplace, a cozy room.

858
00:57:07,756 --> 00:57:09,724
- A little nest.
- That nestles.

859
00:57:09,791 --> 00:57:13,352
#Where the roses bloom #

860
00:57:13,428 --> 00:57:16,261
# Sweet Gracey and me #

861
00:57:16,331 --> 00:57:18,891
#And baby makes three #

862
00:57:18,967 --> 00:57:21,401
#We're going to our #

863
00:57:21,470 --> 00:57:24,337
# Blue heaven #

864
00:57:24,406 --> 00:57:26,966
#When whippoorwills call #

865
00:57:27,042 --> 00:57:29,670
#And evening is nigh #

866
00:57:29,744 --> 00:57:34,681
#We hurry to our blue heaven #

867
00:57:34,749 --> 00:57:37,616
#A turn to the right #

868
00:57:37,686 --> 00:57:40,382
#A little white light #

869
00:57:40,455 --> 00:57:42,821
#Will lead you to our #

870
00:57:42,891 --> 00:57:45,655
# Blue heaven #

871
00:57:45,727 --> 00:57:49,595
#You'll see a smiling face
a fireplace #

872
00:57:49,664 --> 00:57:52,132
#A cozy room #

873
00:57:52,200 --> 00:57:57,035
#A little nest that nestles
where the roses bloom #

874
00:57:57,105 --> 00:58:00,006
# Sweet Gracey and me #

875
00:58:00,075 --> 00:58:02,703
#And baby makes three #

876
00:58:02,777 --> 00:58:08,181
#We're going to our blue heaven #

877
00:58:32,007 --> 00:58:34,601
What are you looking at?

878
00:58:34,676 --> 00:58:38,168
- Beauty?
- Oh?

879
00:58:43,518 --> 00:58:46,646
Yes, butJack...
I mean J. C... I mean Bert...

880
00:58:46,721 --> 00:58:48,712
Oh, hang it.
You're still a Gurney.

881
00:58:48,790 --> 00:58:52,556
Now, listen, that camellia woman
is called Grace Shelley.

882
00:58:52,627 --> 00:58:56,256
Close friend of my father's. He put her
onto it, made her dress like that.

883
00:58:56,331 --> 00:59:00,995
It's absolutely ridiculous.
He wants to marry you off.

884
00:59:01,069 --> 00:59:03,037
Well, Mother's in it too.

885
00:59:03,104 --> 00:59:05,629
And I expect old Tuck
knows all about it.

886
00:59:05,707 --> 00:59:07,698
<i>- Everybody except me.
- Stop!</i>

887
00:59:07,776 --> 00:59:12,543
You're making me a stunted dwarf,
a deformed midget, a crippled newt!

888
00:59:12,614 --> 00:59:15,811
- What are you doing down there?
- It's your negative "insinuendos."

889
00:59:15,884 --> 00:59:19,149
- Insinuendo?
- Insinuendo is insinuation
towards innuendo...

890
00:59:19,221 --> 00:59:21,155
brought on by increased
negativism...

891
00:59:21,223 --> 00:59:23,157
out of a negative reaction
to your father's positivism.

892
00:59:23,225 --> 00:59:25,625
I don't know what the devil you're going
on about, but I resent your attitude.

893
00:59:25,694 --> 00:59:27,992
I'm only telling you
about Grace Shelley.

894
00:59:28,063 --> 00:59:30,998
She's my righteous,
ideal, planned wife!

895
00:59:31,066 --> 00:59:34,627
Don't forget. Apart from being God,
Christ and the Holy Ghost,

896
00:59:34,703 --> 00:59:37,103
I'm also an L.O.B.,
D.F.C. And A.D.C.

897
00:59:37,172 --> 00:59:39,367
You're dealing with the big one!

898
00:59:39,441 --> 00:59:41,568
I've told aged Tucker!

899
00:59:41,643 --> 00:59:44,111
Who... Same thing!

900
00:59:44,179 --> 00:59:48,377
Injecting me with his Kremlin
plots, negative microbes!

901
00:59:48,450 --> 00:59:50,645
I said verbatim,

902
00:59:50,719 --> 00:59:54,587
being persecuted
is paranoid schizophrenia!

903
00:59:54,656 --> 00:59:57,625
Wretched Dr. H. Suffered from same!

904
00:59:59,427 --> 01:00:01,361
I watched.

905
01:00:02,864 --> 01:00:06,027
They fight against me.

906
01:00:07,936 --> 01:00:09,870
Where are the signs...

907
01:00:11,973 --> 01:00:14,840
aiming for...

908
01:00:14,909 --> 01:00:19,608
Herder's dancing academy?

909
01:00:19,681 --> 01:00:26,553
I am being everybody but Christ.

910
01:00:43,738 --> 01:00:48,471
No, no, no, Charles.
I will not solemnize any marriage,

911
01:00:48,543 --> 01:00:52,536
even of my own nephew, during
the period from Advent Sunday...

912
01:00:52,614 --> 01:00:55,913
till eight days after Epiphany.

913
01:00:55,984 --> 01:00:59,852
So, Charles,
it must be Tuesday the 12th,

914
01:00:59,921 --> 01:01:04,881
8:00 a.m., private chapel,
o- ordinary license...

915
01:01:04,959 --> 01:01:09,487
Charles, Charles, I have
grave misgivings, grave misgivings.

916
01:01:09,564 --> 01:01:11,498
- Misgivings? AboutJack?
- Mmm.

917
01:01:11,566 --> 01:01:16,026
No, no, no.
About the bride, Miss Shelley!

918
01:01:16,104 --> 01:01:19,301
Charles,
who is she, hmm, hmm?

919
01:01:19,374 --> 01:01:22,036
What is she?

920
01:01:22,110 --> 01:01:25,307
Ch-Charles, look, I fear, I fear
that she may be using this marriage...

921
01:01:25,380 --> 01:01:28,349
merely to enhance
her social position.

922
01:01:28,416 --> 01:01:31,442
I hear that she says she's
some sort of an entertainer.

923
01:01:31,519 --> 01:01:33,987
I will vouch for Grace Shelley.

924
01:01:34,055 --> 01:01:36,114
- Mmm?
- Mmm!

925
01:01:36,191 --> 01:01:39,024
My husband's an idiot.

926
01:01:39,094 --> 01:01:41,028
That's not my concern.

927
01:01:41,096 --> 01:01:43,257
The Earl is no longer under my care.

928
01:01:43,331 --> 01:01:46,494
That charade with Miss Shelley
made me feel an absolute fool.

929
01:01:46,568 --> 01:01:49,264
And I don't care
to underestimate myself.

930
01:01:49,337 --> 01:01:52,272
I apologize,
but Charles had some idea...

931
01:01:52,340 --> 01:01:55,901
thatJack might accept her if she
dressed up as the Lady of the Camellias.

932
01:01:55,977 --> 01:01:58,002
Sometimes it's very easy to forget...

933
01:01:58,079 --> 01:02:01,412
Sir Charles occupies a position
of responsibility and power.

934
01:02:01,483 --> 01:02:04,452
You know he's on the board
of the Guldenheim Research Foundation?

935
01:02:04,519 --> 01:02:07,545
Yes, he mentioned
you were asking for a grant.

936
01:02:07,622 --> 01:02:10,921
It's only a nominal
£130,000 for a study...

937
01:02:10,992 --> 01:02:13,085
of paranoid,
schizophrenic rats.

938
01:02:14,195 --> 01:02:18,063
Charles, need we be so hasty?

939
01:02:18,133 --> 01:02:20,431
Charles,
God, in His infinite mercy,

940
01:02:20,502 --> 01:02:23,232
has seen fit
to cloud our nervous senses.

941
01:02:23,304 --> 01:02:25,499
But he will recover.
He will recover, Charles.

942
01:02:25,573 --> 01:02:28,701
God is merciful.
Yes, you must believe that, Charles!

943
01:02:28,777 --> 01:02:31,746
God is merciful
in spite of all appearances.

944
01:02:31,813 --> 01:02:34,407
We cannot wait
upon God's mercy, Bertie!

945
01:02:34,482 --> 01:02:37,940
Everything is going to pot.
Dr. Herder at least.

946
01:02:38,019 --> 01:02:40,954
- Herder?
- Herder.

947
01:02:41,022 --> 01:02:44,253
- Is he English?
- No.

948
01:02:44,325 --> 01:02:46,520
Oh. Hmm!

949
01:02:46,594 --> 01:02:51,531
We insert fine silver wires
into the rat's midbrain.

950
01:02:51,599 --> 01:02:56,093
- That rat's behavior
is then controlled...

951
01:02:56,171 --> 01:02:59,106
by the strength of the current
passing through them.

952
01:02:59,174 --> 01:03:03,440
<i>By pressing above them and stimulating
one area of the midbrain,</i>

953
01:03:03,511 --> 01:03:05,877
<i>the rat is made to feel threatened.</i>

954
01:03:05,947 --> 01:03:07,972
<i>It attacks any rat in sight.</i>

955
01:03:08,049 --> 01:03:09,983
<i>There's really no threat,</i>

956
01:03:10,051 --> 01:03:12,281
<i>- but the midbrain
can't tell the difference.</i>

957
01:03:12,353 --> 01:03:15,754
Roughly the same thing happens
with human paranoids.

958
01:03:15,824 --> 01:03:18,418
But an unknown area
of the brain stimulated,

959
01:03:18,493 --> 01:03:21,462
and they feel threatened
without cause.

960
01:03:21,529 --> 01:03:24,555
Naturally, men aren't rats.

961
01:03:24,632 --> 01:03:26,793
Only a man would say so.

962
01:03:31,673 --> 01:03:34,335
Our next step is to conduct
similar experiments...

963
01:03:34,409 --> 01:03:36,343
on humans' brains.

964
01:03:36,411 --> 01:03:40,575
I see. Today, rats;
tomorrow, the world.

965
01:03:40,648 --> 01:03:42,673
Who will you wire for vision?

966
01:03:42,750 --> 01:03:45,344
First of all, myself, naturally.

967
01:03:45,420 --> 01:03:47,354
I see.

968
01:03:47,422 --> 01:03:52,155
And if I press a button,
you'll feel fear... love?

969
01:03:52,227 --> 01:03:54,889
Love? No.

970
01:03:54,963 --> 01:03:57,693
Desire. Yes.

971
01:03:57,765 --> 01:04:01,633
What, by pressing a little button?

972
01:04:03,171 --> 01:04:05,935
Oh.

973
01:04:06,007 --> 01:04:07,941
Think of the risk, Doctor.

974
01:04:08,009 --> 01:04:12,571
Oh, there is only one commandment
a doctor need ever worry about:

975
01:04:12,647 --> 01:04:16,640
Thou shalt not... advertise.

976
01:04:51,786 --> 01:04:54,516
My heart...

977
01:04:54,589 --> 01:04:57,023
rises with the sun.

978
01:05:00,562 --> 01:05:04,931
I'm purged of doubts
and negative innuendos.

979
01:05:06,434 --> 01:05:09,733
Today,
I want to bless everything.

980
01:05:10,939 --> 01:05:14,636
Bless the crawfish
with its scuttling walk.

981
01:05:14,709 --> 01:05:18,736
Bless the trout,
pilchard and periwinkle.

982
01:05:18,813 --> 01:05:24,115
Bless Ted Smoothey
of 22 East Hackney Road.

983
01:05:24,185 --> 01:05:26,119
Bless the mealy redpoll,

984
01:05:26,187 --> 01:05:29,054
the black-gloved wallaby
and W.C. Fields...

985
01:05:29,123 --> 01:05:31,683
who's dead but lives on.

986
01:05:31,759 --> 01:05:34,660
Bless the snotty-nosed giraffe.

987
01:05:34,729 --> 01:05:36,856
Bless the buffalo.

988
01:05:36,931 --> 01:05:40,594
Bless the Society of Women Engineers.

989
01:05:40,668 --> 01:05:43,364
Bless the pygmy hippos.

990
01:05:43,438 --> 01:05:46,305
Bless the mighty cockroach.

991
01:05:46,374 --> 01:05:48,308
Bless me!

992
01:05:48,376 --> 01:05:51,436
Today's my wedding day!

993
01:06:14,102 --> 01:06:16,400
Wake up, Bertie!

994
01:06:33,488 --> 01:06:35,649
Come, Bertie.
Get on with it.

995
01:06:35,723 --> 01:06:37,657
D- D-Dearly beloved,

996
01:06:37,725 --> 01:06:41,627
we are gathered here together,
in the sight of God...

997
01:06:46,000 --> 01:06:49,492
Get on with it, Bertie!

998
01:06:49,570 --> 01:06:52,937
A- A-A-And in the face
of this company,

999
01:06:53,007 --> 01:06:55,999
t- t-t-t-to join together
this man and this woman...

1000
01:06:56,077 --> 01:06:59,706
in holy matrimony,
which is an honorable estate...

1001
01:06:59,781 --> 01:07:03,012
Instituted by me
in the time of man's innocence.

1002
01:07:05,153 --> 01:07:08,054
<i>- Get on, Bertie!
- Therefore,</i>

1003
01:07:08,122 --> 01:07:13,617
if there be any in this company
who can show just cause...

1004
01:07:13,695 --> 01:07:17,358
<i>why these two
may not be joined together,</i>

1005
01:07:17,432 --> 01:07:21,801
let him speak now
or forever hold his peace.

1006
01:07:21,869 --> 01:07:26,897
Load of British jelly-meat whiskers!
Piddling, half-dead helots.

1007
01:07:26,974 --> 01:07:28,965
Quiet, man!
Show some respect!

1008
01:07:29,043 --> 01:07:31,876
I always show respect, sir.

1009
01:07:31,946 --> 01:07:35,040
That's what I'm paid for.

1010
01:07:35,116 --> 01:07:37,710
No one can say
I don't show respect.

1011
01:07:39,220 --> 01:07:41,188
Now come on, Bertie.

1012
01:07:42,857 --> 01:07:45,826
Now I require and ch...

1013
01:07:45,893 --> 01:07:48,157
I require and charge you both...

1014
01:07:48,229 --> 01:07:51,130
that if either of you
know of any impediment...

1015
01:07:51,199 --> 01:07:55,465
why ye may not lawfully
be joined together,

1016
01:07:55,536 --> 01:07:59,939
that you "de" now...
you "de"...

1017
01:08:00,007 --> 01:08:02,942
Ye do now confess it.

1018
01:08:03,010 --> 01:08:06,070
Yes, I'm afraid
I do know an impediment.

1019
01:08:06,147 --> 01:08:09,446
But it's only a rhetorical
question, like all the others
in the wedding service.

1020
01:08:09,517 --> 01:08:11,576
Oh, 'tis no good
glossing o'er the fact...

1021
01:08:11,652 --> 01:08:16,749
certain Roman Catholic knackers think
I'm already married to the Virgin Mary.

1022
01:08:16,824 --> 01:08:18,951
We're not concerned
with what other people think,

1023
01:08:19,026 --> 01:08:21,586
especially Roman Catholics.

1024
01:08:21,662 --> 01:08:23,857
Get on with it, Bertie. Come on now.

1025
01:08:23,931 --> 01:08:27,924
Wilt thou, wilt thou take
this woman to thy wedded wife,

1026
01:08:28,002 --> 01:08:32,336
to live together i-i-in holy wedlock
under God's ordinance?

1027
01:08:32,406 --> 01:08:34,374
W- W-Wilt thou love her?

1028
01:08:34,442 --> 01:08:37,775
From the bottom of my soul
to the tip of my penis,

1029
01:08:37,845 --> 01:08:40,746
like the sun in its brightness,
the moon in its glory,

1030
01:08:40,815 --> 01:08:43,375
no breeze stirs
that doesn't bear my love.

1031
01:08:48,489 --> 01:08:51,287
- Come on, Bertie! Come on!
- Charles, blasphemy.

1032
01:08:51,359 --> 01:08:53,850
- But will you love me?
- I will.

1033
01:08:55,530 --> 01:09:01,196
<i>Wilt thou take this man to thy...
- I will.</i>

1034
01:09:01,269 --> 01:09:04,238
- To live together in holy matrimony...
- I will!

1035
01:09:04,305 --> 01:09:08,401
- Who giveth his...
- I do!

1036
01:09:08,476 --> 01:09:11,411
- Oh, you.
- Come on, Bertie.

1037
01:09:11,479 --> 01:09:15,279
<i>- Get a move on!
- R-R-Repeat after me.</i>

1038
01:09:15,349 --> 01:09:18,443
I, l...

1039
01:09:18,519 --> 01:09:21,511
J.C., take thee, Grace Shelley,

1040
01:09:21,589 --> 01:09:23,523
<i>to my wedded wife.</i>

1041
01:09:23,591 --> 01:09:26,788
I,J.C., the holy,
flying roller, the morning star,

1042
01:09:26,861 --> 01:09:32,163
take thee Marguerite,
called Grace Shelley, because she
doesn't speak French, to my wedded wife.

1043
01:09:33,668 --> 01:09:35,636
Where are you going, Bertie?

1044
01:09:39,207 --> 01:09:41,368
<i>- Repeat after me.
- Oh, I know the lines.</i>

1045
01:09:41,442 --> 01:09:44,377
I, Grace Shelley, take theeJ.C.
To my wedded husband...

1046
01:09:44,445 --> 01:09:48,541
better, worse, richer, poorer,
this day, sickness, health,
I plight thee my troth.

1047
01:09:48,616 --> 01:09:51,414
Plight thee my troth, yes.

1048
01:09:51,485 --> 01:09:55,785
Well, inasmuch as you
are now bound in holy wedlock,

1049
01:09:55,857 --> 01:10:00,487
l- l-I now pro-pronounce thee
man and wife!

1050
01:10:00,561 --> 01:10:05,055
God join together, no man,
no man put asunder,

1051
01:10:05,132 --> 01:10:07,430
in the name of the Father, the Son...

1052
01:10:07,501 --> 01:10:10,561
and Holy, the Holy, the Holy Ghost.

1053
01:10:10,638 --> 01:10:12,572
God have mercy on me.

1054
01:10:47,775 --> 01:10:49,709
<i>A bit tatty, Jeeves.</i>

1055
01:10:49,777 --> 01:10:53,269
No guests, no reception,
two plates of curled up sandwiches...

1056
01:10:53,347 --> 01:10:55,542
and a deformed wedding cake.

1057
01:10:55,616 --> 01:10:58,141
It's not my fault, Your Ladyship.

1058
01:10:58,219 --> 01:11:00,847
"Your Ladyship." That's better.

1059
01:11:00,922 --> 01:11:03,390
I'll watch 'em creep
and crawl at Harrods.

1060
01:11:03,457 --> 01:11:05,891
We thought you'd like
a nice, quiet affair.

1061
01:11:05,960 --> 01:11:09,623
Huh! Quiet's right! And what about
a toast to the newlyweds or something?

1062
01:11:09,697 --> 01:11:13,098
- You know.
- All right.

1063
01:11:13,167 --> 01:11:16,500
Here's to long life and happiness
for the bride and groom.

1064
01:11:16,570 --> 01:11:19,004
- To the bride and groom!
- Thank you.

1065
01:11:19,073 --> 01:11:22,338
In reply, I name this ship
"Loving Kindness."

1066
01:11:22,410 --> 01:11:25,072
May I keep her
and all who sail in her.

1067
01:11:32,053 --> 01:11:37,685
Ah, you should have seen
the late earl's wedding, m'lady.

1068
01:11:37,758 --> 01:11:42,786
Five hundred guests,
the creme de menthe.

1069
01:11:42,863 --> 01:11:46,264
Wastrels all.
May their carbonized bones rot in hell!
