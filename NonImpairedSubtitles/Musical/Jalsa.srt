1
00:00:46,112 --> 00:00:49,411
In our nation, one in
a lakh people owns a bungalow.

2
00:00:49,849 --> 00:00:52,010
One in a thousand owns a car.

3
00:00:52,318 --> 00:00:54,616
One in a hundred owns a computer.

4
00:00:54,721 --> 00:00:58,555
But ever one of tow has
a gun or a sickle.

5
00:00:59,392 --> 00:01:02,623
There are more opportunities
to die than live.

6
00:01:02,729 --> 00:01:04,162
My friend told so

7
00:01:04,264 --> 00:01:07,756
I can never forget
what he told his student..

8
00:01:07,867 --> 00:01:09,425
...who had come
to learn Kung Fu at him.

9
00:01:09,803 --> 00:01:13,239
Not always it requires to kill
the opponent to win the battle..

10
00:01:14,340 --> 00:01:16,433
It'll be nice if he
completes this sentence.

11
00:01:16,609 --> 00:01:19,237
His name is Sanjay Sahu.

12
00:01:29,089 --> 00:01:32,058
Come on, let's enjoy it!

13
00:01:34,360 --> 00:01:37,921
JALSA
[Enjoyment]

14
00:01:38,431 --> 00:01:40,729
He consumes liquor
ever Saturday and Sunday.

15
00:01:41,101 --> 00:01:44,593
He drinks it on Monday with scare that
he shouldn't drink for remaining 5 days.

16
00:01:44,771 --> 00:01:47,399
He drinks on Tuesday that it has passed.

17
00:01:47,507 --> 00:01:50,476
He drinks on Wednesday, in
the agony of that Saturday hasn't come..

18
00:01:50,577 --> 00:01:52,545
He drinks on Thursday and Friday..

19
00:01:52,645 --> 00:01:55,273
...out of shame that
he boozes daily.

20
00:01:55,381 --> 00:01:58,214
- So, he drinks liquor whole week.
- Sir! The glass has broken.

21
00:01:58,318 --> 00:02:01,082
Henceforth keep steel glass.
It won't break.

22
00:02:08,328 --> 00:02:11,024
He has a bad habit along with drinking.

23
00:02:11,464 --> 00:02:12,556
It's studying.

24
00:02:12,999 --> 00:02:15,490
- He has done 3 Post Graduations
already. -Greetings sir!

25
00:02:15,602 --> 00:02:17,570
Present he is doing 4th PG.

26
00:02:20,340 --> 00:02:21,830
What you are thinking is right.

27
00:02:21,941 --> 00:02:25,900
- They both are in love.
- Stop it.

28
00:02:47,167 --> 00:02:48,998
- Are you sleeping?
- No.

29
00:02:49,102 --> 00:02:50,797
How could you sleep
in this tension?

30
00:02:50,904 --> 00:02:52,394
I didn't sleep.

31
00:02:52,639 --> 00:02:55,335
Look! I am sending my all forces
on your father closing my eyes.

32
00:02:56,376 --> 00:02:58,469
- Come out.
- Ok.

33
00:02:58,778 --> 00:03:00,939
- The door is stuck.
- What? Get down.

34
00:03:01,047 --> 00:03:03,072
- The door lock is locked.
- Do it, no problem.

35
00:03:14,327 --> 00:03:15,817
Get down.
No problem.

36
00:03:20,867 --> 00:03:22,164
Don't talk too much.

37
00:03:22,268 --> 00:03:23,565
- Ok.
- He thinks you are an innocent.

38
00:03:23,670 --> 00:03:26,161
- I won't open my mouth.
- He thinks that you're arrogant.

39
00:03:26,739 --> 00:03:27,637
Ok.

40
00:03:29,008 --> 00:03:32,637
Indhu! You had it earlier.
But now I am facing it.

41
00:03:32,745 --> 00:03:35,111
- What?
- Approving the groom.

42
00:03:41,821 --> 00:03:43,049
Gosh! Is it him?

43
00:03:43,423 --> 00:03:44,583
Hey..

44
00:03:46,492 --> 00:03:47,390
Come.

45
00:03:50,763 --> 00:03:55,325
- Can I sit here? -You don't lack
in all these dignified talk.

46
00:03:55,435 --> 00:03:57,198
But you don't ask me
to approve your love.

47
00:03:57,303 --> 00:04:00,136
- It'll be disgusting if I ask you.
- What?

48
00:04:00,306 --> 00:04:04,072
How can I ask you to permit to
love your daughter or elope with her?

49
00:04:04,177 --> 00:04:07,669
- Don't tr to talk smart.
- It'll be disgusting sir.

50
00:04:07,780 --> 00:04:09,407
What qualification do you have
to marr with my daughter?

51
00:04:09,515 --> 00:04:10,812
Wealth or fame?

52
00:04:10,917 --> 00:04:12,544
You have curly hair alone.

53
00:04:12,652 --> 00:04:14,142
If you want,
I'll change my hair style.

54
00:04:14,254 --> 00:04:18,623
Even if you change your life style,
I won't let my daughter marr you.

55
00:04:20,059 --> 00:04:21,549
It's injustice sir.

56
00:04:23,329 --> 00:04:24,694
Are you taking out the revolver?

57
00:04:24,931 --> 00:04:27,024
Will you kill this innocent
because we fell in love?

58
00:04:27,200 --> 00:04:29,361
You said you will elope my daughter.
How will you be an innocent?

59
00:04:29,469 --> 00:04:31,096
Look at it!

60
00:04:33,339 --> 00:04:34,431
Who is he, sir?

61
00:04:34,607 --> 00:04:35,574
He is going to become my son-in-law.

62
00:04:35,675 --> 00:04:37,233
What do I lack?

63
00:04:37,610 --> 00:04:38,440
Your height.

64
00:04:38,544 --> 00:04:40,239
Your colour.
And your education.

65
00:04:40,346 --> 00:04:41,973
Money is important than everything.

66
00:04:42,081 --> 00:04:43,912
Money is important to live.

67
00:04:44,017 --> 00:04:46,247
But it's wrong that
money only is important.

68
00:04:48,488 --> 00:04:51,855
- A house and a car are
also required. -You..

69
00:04:51,958 --> 00:04:54,791
- How much stipend you get for a month?
- From Rs.3,500 to 4,000.

70
00:04:54,894 --> 00:04:56,862
Is it a bus to go from here to there?

71
00:04:56,963 --> 00:04:58,794
Tell correctly.
Rs. 3,500 or 4,000?

72
00:04:58,898 --> 00:05:00,388
- 3,500 rupees.
- What?

73
00:05:00,500 --> 00:05:01,728
3,500 rupees.

74
00:05:01,901 --> 00:05:03,266
Do you know how much he gets?

75
00:05:03,369 --> 00:05:04,336
One lakh and fifty thousand rupees.

76
00:05:04,437 --> 00:05:06,667
- For an year?
- For a month!

77
00:05:07,040 --> 00:05:09,008
Is he doing a job or
black mailing the owner?

78
00:05:09,108 --> 00:05:10,735
He is a software engineer.

79
00:05:11,244 --> 00:05:13,075
I am giving 1 crore rupee as dowry.

80
00:05:13,246 --> 00:05:14,213
If you give me that 1 crore rupees..

81
00:05:14,314 --> 00:05:16,282
...I'll lend it out get you
Rs.3 lakh interest for a month.

82
00:05:17,383 --> 00:05:18,748
Are you taking out another photo?

83
00:05:21,054 --> 00:05:22,487
He looks very handsome, sir!

84
00:05:22,588 --> 00:05:24,283
- Really?
- Yes sir.

85
00:05:25,058 --> 00:05:27,891
- No doubt, he is first class.
- Don't feel shy to tell.

86
00:05:27,994 --> 00:05:30,360
There's no doubt.
Fix this alliance.

87
00:05:35,134 --> 00:05:36,499
What did my dad say?

88
00:05:40,206 --> 00:05:41,503
What did you say?

89
00:05:45,078 --> 00:05:46,238
What should we do now?

90
00:05:52,018 --> 00:05:53,781
You idiot!

91
00:05:58,891 --> 00:05:59,789
Don't cr!

92
00:05:59,892 --> 00:06:02,520
If anyone sees you, they think
that you are crying for the bride.

93
00:06:08,501 --> 00:06:09,593
Greetings sir!

94
00:06:16,042 --> 00:06:17,134
Why have you come here?

95
00:06:17,510 --> 00:06:19,944
We heard outside that
food is good here.

96
00:06:20,113 --> 00:06:22,343
That's why, my friends asked me..

97
00:06:23,916 --> 00:06:25,611
...-To bring here.
- Who is he uncle?

98
00:06:26,185 --> 00:06:28,881
Didn't I tell you that a guy loved Indhu?
He is that guy.

99
00:06:29,055 --> 00:06:30,283
Have you told everything?

100
00:06:30,456 --> 00:06:31,821
I have a doubt on you.

101
00:06:31,924 --> 00:06:34,085
You may blackmail her..

102
00:06:34,193 --> 00:06:36,559
...when you need money.

103
00:06:36,662 --> 00:06:37,686
Is it me?

104
00:06:38,064 --> 00:06:41,090
If I want I'll ask her and take it.
Why should I blackmail her?

105
00:06:41,200 --> 00:06:43,293
Dear! Reddy sir told that
he brings his children..

106
00:06:45,605 --> 00:06:48,039
- You know him already, isn't it?
Yes. -I too know her.

107
00:06:48,808 --> 00:06:52,175
- Take us a photo. -Thulasi dear!
Bring the garland. -Coming aunty.

108
00:06:52,278 --> 00:06:53,643
Thulasi madam! I'll take it.

109
00:07:06,092 --> 00:07:08,185
Please be seated.
I'll come.

110
00:07:09,028 --> 00:07:11,588
A little more.

111
00:07:15,501 --> 00:07:20,461
After 52 weeks this love story got failed
a girl entered his life.

112
00:07:33,453 --> 00:07:35,284
Girls never come alone.

113
00:07:35,521 --> 00:07:37,079
Like sweat in summer..

114
00:07:37,323 --> 00:07:38,881
Mud in Rainy season..

115
00:07:39,058 --> 00:07:40,753
Mosquitoes in winter..

116
00:07:41,127 --> 00:07:44,619
Girls and rowdies come
as undivided package.

117
00:07:50,002 --> 00:07:53,028
What is this?
Hefty ladies are coming.

118
00:07:53,739 --> 00:07:55,707
Why do they come to gym
if they are slim?

119
00:07:55,875 --> 00:07:57,365
They'll tr into the movies.

120
00:07:57,610 --> 00:07:59,703
Let us see who's comes out
in next 5 minutes.

121
00:07:59,812 --> 00:08:02,508
If it's a slim girl she's mine.
Yours, if it's otherwise.

122
00:08:59,272 --> 00:09:00,364
Let's go for a drive.

123
00:09:02,141 --> 00:09:05,304
Let's do it in the car.
Tell me.

124
00:09:19,292 --> 00:09:20,190
Stop.

125
00:09:28,768 --> 00:09:30,668
it's not hot,

126
00:09:30,770 --> 00:09:33,864
Road means it's not a road,

127
00:09:34,040 --> 00:09:36,941
it's full of ups and downs,

128
00:09:37,243 --> 00:09:39,734
They are teasing us, sir.

129
00:09:40,246 --> 00:09:43,340
Ask them not to disturb our song.

130
00:09:45,184 --> 00:09:46,276
Are they your friends?

131
00:09:46,385 --> 00:09:47,409
Talk them and come fast.

132
00:09:47,520 --> 00:09:50,489
I'll sit there and recollect my lyrics.

133
00:09:54,794 --> 00:09:57,558
You may join with us after we finish.

134
00:10:00,733 --> 00:10:04,169
Will we have the mood to rape them
after we kill him?

135
00:10:08,474 --> 00:10:09,441
Run away.

136
00:10:23,489 --> 00:10:25,855
Catch him.
Don't leave him.

137
00:10:38,304 --> 00:10:39,635
I feel giddy.

138
00:10:40,272 --> 00:10:42,433
All the liquor spilled out
because of you.

139
00:10:48,447 --> 00:10:52,008
Hey Chotu!

140
00:10:52,184 --> 00:10:54,812
For how many years
you have been learning from me?

141
00:10:54,920 --> 00:10:57,013
- For how many years..
- For 5 years.

142
00:10:57,123 --> 00:10:59,489
5 years, isn't it?
What did I say you?

143
00:10:59,592 --> 00:11:04,620
Didn't I tell you the guy
whom you slap shouldn't get up?

144
00:11:04,864 --> 00:11:07,025
- Did I tell you or not?
- You told.

145
00:11:07,133 --> 00:11:09,693
Then why are you
fighting like a child's play?

146
00:11:12,471 --> 00:11:14,439
Hey fatso, come!

147
00:11:16,676 --> 00:11:19,440
You come and show me
how you hit him just now.

148
00:11:19,945 --> 00:11:21,310
No problem, show me.

149
00:11:23,949 --> 00:11:26,179
There is a good communication
among you. Hit me.

150
00:11:46,572 --> 00:11:49,541
Not only the songs,
even the fights are also romantic.

151
00:11:57,983 --> 00:11:59,883
Remember only one thing.

152
00:11:59,985 --> 00:12:03,546
We get like this rod rarely like
getting tickets for Chiranjeevi cinema.

153
00:12:03,656 --> 00:12:06,887
We shouldn't fight empty-handed
because they're empty handed.

154
00:12:06,992 --> 00:12:08,357
Only one concentration.

155
00:12:08,461 --> 00:12:10,361
We have a rod in our hand
and his head is there.

156
00:12:10,463 --> 00:12:12,294
Our rod,
his head.

157
00:12:12,398 --> 00:12:14,764
If we hit them their head
should break into pieces.

158
00:13:20,332 --> 00:13:22,300
Do you know the use of the rain?

159
00:13:22,468 --> 00:13:26,097
He and I only know that he pissed.

160
00:13:27,339 --> 00:13:29,569
Do you know it?
Take me to the house.

161
00:13:30,543 --> 00:13:33,239
In the windstorm,

162
00:13:34,280 --> 00:13:35,645
He looks handsome, isn't it?

163
00:13:46,158 --> 00:13:47,386
Girls look good in pharmacy.

164
00:13:47,493 --> 00:13:48,790
Boys look good in physics.

165
00:13:48,894 --> 00:13:50,725
Lecturers look good in maths.

166
00:14:02,541 --> 00:14:04,509
You have come so far in half an hour..

167
00:14:04,710 --> 00:14:07,076
...So it'll easy to you to count
till the wall in 3 hours.

168
00:14:07,913 --> 00:14:09,005
Is there a wall?

169
00:14:09,915 --> 00:14:12,941
It won't be a difference whether the wall
is there or not after you count to 1 lakh.

170
00:14:27,266 --> 00:14:29,564
- What is your name?
- Saroja.

171
00:14:29,668 --> 00:14:31,033
Did you give 'sir' to your husband?

172
00:14:31,470 --> 00:14:34,462
- I am not married yet, sir.
- Will you marr me?

173
00:14:35,941 --> 00:14:39,308
Are you angry or grateful?
You don't worry.

174
00:14:39,612 --> 00:14:40,977
I won't give you hard works like them.

175
00:14:41,080 --> 00:14:43,048
You seemed a slim girl.
It's very easy.

176
00:14:43,349 --> 00:14:45,112
Come and kiss me on
my cheeks and go straight..

177
00:14:45,217 --> 00:14:46,241
...there will be your classroom
at right side.

178
00:14:46,352 --> 00:14:48,320
- Study well.
- Kiss?

179
00:14:48,420 --> 00:14:50,684
Don't you want?
Ok, we'll do it so easily.

180
00:14:51,457 --> 00:14:53,118
I'll come and kiss on your lips..

181
00:14:53,359 --> 00:14:55,054
...If you go straight, there will be
your classroom at right side.

182
00:14:55,160 --> 00:14:56,127
Study well.

183
00:15:03,235 --> 00:15:06,136
Who is he? He looks like
slim Chiranjeevi. How can he help us?

184
00:15:17,249 --> 00:15:18,739
Seems he is in a romantic mood.

185
00:15:19,118 --> 00:15:19,914
Where is he?

186
00:15:23,923 --> 00:15:25,083
Girls! Who is the guy from..

187
00:15:25,190 --> 00:15:28,956
Look dear! You mind your
business of your department.

188
00:15:29,328 --> 00:15:30,454
It's our problem.

189
00:15:30,562 --> 00:15:32,689
We'll rag for fun,
and rape seriously.

190
00:15:32,932 --> 00:15:33,762
Why do you bother?

191
00:15:34,266 --> 00:15:35,096
- Oh gosh!
- Why should I bother?

192
00:15:39,605 --> 00:15:42,039
If girls get ragged
they call me for help.

193
00:15:42,341 --> 00:15:43,706
Who is he in between?

194
00:15:44,543 --> 00:15:45,601
Call the guy who ragged them.

195
00:15:45,744 --> 00:15:47,109
- It is him only.
- Is it him?

196
00:15:48,614 --> 00:15:52,516
Call me again when he gets up,
I'll come and hit him again.

197
00:15:54,353 --> 00:15:56,548
Look darling!
You don't worry.

198
00:15:57,356 --> 00:16:01,690
Keep your romantic eyes up and
go straight jumping with your feet..

199
00:16:01,794 --> 00:16:04,991
...and turn right side,
your classroom is there.

200
00:16:05,764 --> 00:16:07,732
You'll get a degree
if you study in leisure time.

201
00:16:08,033 --> 00:16:11,525
He'll get a headache
when he sees you.

202
00:16:45,204 --> 00:16:49,163
Live the life happily.

203
00:16:49,341 --> 00:16:53,300
Should swim against the tide
if you jump into a river.

204
00:16:53,612 --> 00:16:57,571
Did Hiroshima stop its growing,
after the atom bomb explosion?

205
00:16:57,750 --> 00:17:01,709
Cheer up, we'll live only a few days,

206
00:17:01,954 --> 00:17:05,822
No worries, mingle joyfully,

207
00:17:06,091 --> 00:17:10,152
Let's go for a variety look
moving the mirror aside

208
00:17:10,362 --> 00:17:14,298
if we say in Telugu,
don't worry be happy,

209
00:17:14,500 --> 00:17:17,799
Let's change into another version
mixing a new look,

210
00:17:17,903 --> 00:17:21,669
Let's cheer up saying,
you and I, let's go high,

211
00:17:22,041 --> 00:17:26,000
Life is like Saturday night,
Let's cheer up,

212
00:18:04,216 --> 00:18:08,312
The colourful life is inviting you,

213
00:18:08,420 --> 00:18:11,651
Throw your doubts away,

214
00:18:12,691 --> 00:18:16,684
if you have the belief,
tears taste like ambrosia,

215
00:18:16,829 --> 00:18:19,992
Pain looks like a wonder, isn't it?

216
00:18:25,838 --> 00:18:29,535
In botanical language they are petals,

217
00:18:29,908 --> 00:18:33,708
In material science
they are dreams in the brain,

218
00:18:34,079 --> 00:18:37,879
In mechanical breathing they are thoughts,

219
00:18:38,317 --> 00:18:41,480
In heart's language
they are sweet stories,

220
00:19:30,235 --> 00:19:34,069
To get the victory,
fight is compulsory,

221
00:19:34,439 --> 00:19:37,499
Don't bother about the risk, buddy!

222
00:19:38,577 --> 00:19:42,604
If you want to climb Himalayas,
no need to worry about anything,

223
00:19:42,714 --> 00:19:46,150
Engraving your name in
the history is your aim,

224
00:19:51,657 --> 00:19:55,491
Let's move here and there
in the thoughts of Utopia,

225
00:19:55,727 --> 00:19:59,663
Let's rise up and dance
to the tunes of Euphoria.

226
00:20:00,065 --> 00:20:03,831
The world is a magic
in the eyes of Philosophy,

227
00:20:04,203 --> 00:20:07,366
We won't find any of us
in the anatomy lab,

228
00:20:36,134 --> 00:20:38,364
Take a deep breath!
Stop it.

229
00:20:38,737 --> 00:20:39,567
Exhale it out when I tell you.

230
00:20:42,407 --> 00:20:43,772
If you want to know Yoga,
you can come to me.

231
00:20:43,875 --> 00:20:45,308
If you want to know it well,
you can go to him.

232
00:20:45,544 --> 00:20:47,171
- If we want to meet Sanju..
- Go inside!

233
00:20:49,948 --> 00:20:51,210
You idiot!

234
00:20:52,618 --> 00:20:54,711
What is this?
He fell down like that.

235
00:20:58,624 --> 00:20:59,420
Is he gone?

236
00:20:59,558 --> 00:21:00,616
He should have told me
when he wanted to breathe.

237
00:21:00,759 --> 00:21:01,657
Why did he feel shy for that?

238
00:21:11,169 --> 00:21:12,397
Who is it?

239
00:21:14,373 --> 00:21:15,169
It's an hangover.

240
00:21:15,974 --> 00:21:17,874
It feels like a hammer hit
even if a small pin falls over.

241
00:21:18,510 --> 00:21:19,442
- Night..
- Flowers.

242
00:21:23,782 --> 00:21:26,273
Hangover will vanish if
the last night leftover beer is consumed.

243
00:21:28,720 --> 00:21:29,880
Your house is nice.

244
00:21:31,056 --> 00:21:32,956
It's not my home.
It's his uncle's.

245
00:21:34,926 --> 00:21:36,450
Your taste is seen in the furniture.

246
00:21:36,995 --> 00:21:38,963
The cost is visible but not the taste.

247
00:21:39,398 --> 00:21:41,298
Because it's not mine,
it's his.

248
00:21:44,670 --> 00:21:47,639
- Tell me the matter.
- Say thanks.

249
00:22:04,690 --> 00:22:05,520
You wait here.

250
00:22:06,591 --> 00:22:08,354
I'll send them out, lock the door
and come back.

251
00:22:08,760 --> 00:22:10,387
We'll do it.

252
00:22:12,230 --> 00:22:13,026
What do we do?

253
00:22:13,899 --> 00:22:17,198
Not this and that, let's do it directly.

254
00:22:17,903 --> 00:22:20,133
I didn't say you
I love you in that thought.

255
00:22:20,238 --> 00:22:21,364
In which thought you said it?

256
00:22:22,107 --> 00:22:22,903
Shall I tell you?

257
00:22:23,241 --> 00:22:25,141
If you say me I love you,
I should say 'Me too'.

258
00:22:25,577 --> 00:22:26,976
Will you keep quiet after telling it...?

259
00:22:27,245 --> 00:22:28,712
We should marr in 3 or 4 years.

260
00:22:29,047 --> 00:22:30,446
Will you keep quiet
after getting married...?

261
00:22:30,716 --> 00:22:34,174
Movies, shopping, saris and blouses..

262
00:22:34,586 --> 00:22:36,053
...otherwise crying or yelling.

263
00:22:36,455 --> 00:22:38,218
If we slap you to control..

264
00:22:38,590 --> 00:22:41,753
...domestic violence, torture in house,
women organizations and TV 9.

265
00:22:41,927 --> 00:22:44,760
Gathering all of them you'll tie
us like a dog to the window.

266
00:22:45,464 --> 00:22:48,228
To bear all these..

267
00:22:51,203 --> 00:22:52,227
Don't you like me?

268
00:22:53,405 --> 00:22:54,599
200 percent I don't like you.

269
00:22:55,807 --> 00:22:56,705
Say only one reason.

270
00:22:57,642 --> 00:22:59,234
Do you have any problem
if I say you 3 reasons?

271
00:23:00,078 --> 00:23:02,740
One is your pony tail.

272
00:23:05,217 --> 00:23:07,048
Second one is your high heels.

273
00:23:08,487 --> 00:23:12,924
Third one is your brilliance.
I don't like it.

274
00:23:16,228 --> 00:23:17,058
Is that all?

275
00:23:17,496 --> 00:23:18,554
Not only that, there is another thing.

276
00:23:18,663 --> 00:23:21,325
When you go out lock the door lightly,
I want to go to bed.

277
00:23:27,906 --> 00:23:28,770
Why are you here?

278
00:23:31,243 --> 00:23:32,073
Is she your friend?

279
00:23:33,245 --> 00:23:34,803
Why've you let you hair loose
like a ghost?

280
00:23:36,114 --> 00:23:37,809
Why are you holding your slippers?
Yuck!

281
00:23:40,652 --> 00:23:42,279
You said that you don't like it.

282
00:23:43,455 --> 00:23:45,582
It doesn't suit for her.
It'll suit for you.

283
00:23:50,796 --> 00:23:51,660
Will you come once?

284
00:23:51,863 --> 00:23:53,626
- Is it urgent or important?
- It's serious.

285
00:23:53,799 --> 00:23:54,891
Serious! Come.

286
00:23:58,336 --> 00:24:01,430
I tried a Yoga step.
I don't now how to remove it.

287
00:24:04,876 --> 00:24:07,037
- How did you do it?
- It happened like that.

288
00:24:07,479 --> 00:24:09,037
We should get all of
his parts into a position.

289
00:24:09,681 --> 00:24:11,842
Instead of that, it's enough
if you turn his head only.

290
00:24:13,752 --> 00:24:16,778
- Joining both of you will kill him.
- That is..

291
00:24:17,823 --> 00:24:19,518
- Is your father rich?
- Yes.

292
00:24:21,493 --> 00:24:22,357
He should be.

293
00:24:22,594 --> 00:24:25,062
If you want to get a degree with
this brain, he should be a millionaire.

294
00:25:01,500 --> 00:25:03,024
Koka Peta
Site settlement.

295
00:25:04,469 --> 00:25:05,367
Greetings sir!

296
00:25:06,905 --> 00:25:09,032
They both bought 10 acres in Koka Peta.

297
00:25:09,541 --> 00:25:10,803
But the owner of the site
hasn't sold it yet.

298
00:25:11,576 --> 00:25:14,306
They say that they've given
him 5 crores advance.

299
00:25:15,480 --> 00:25:18,643
But some Lala from Pune
has come in the middle.

300
00:25:19,284 --> 00:25:21,445
He bought that site giving
50 crores more than them.

301
00:25:21,887 --> 00:25:23,047
They are digging a bore, sir!

302
00:25:23,154 --> 00:25:24,519
They told more enough.

303
00:25:24,823 --> 00:25:27,383
He is a wicked guy and
eats mutton biriyani.

304
00:25:27,492 --> 00:25:29,653
They are good people
and eat curd rice only.

305
00:25:29,961 --> 00:25:31,656
He will build a bar here.

306
00:25:32,097 --> 00:25:34,657
But they will build a temple.

307
00:25:35,100 --> 00:25:36,465
Saying like this...

308
00:25:36,768 --> 00:25:39,896
To make me crazy like this
problems come to my settlement.

309
00:25:51,983 --> 00:25:53,473
Do you feel like laughing at me?

310
00:25:54,786 --> 00:25:56,845
This should come.

311
00:25:59,057 --> 00:26:03,016
Getting 10,000 rupees salary for a month,
if you guard me recklessly..

312
00:26:05,030 --> 00:26:06,998
...someone will come and shoot me.

313
00:26:08,033 --> 00:26:10,900
Something has run
from here to there, isn't it?

314
00:26:11,536 --> 00:26:13,436
- What is it?
- Fear!

315
00:26:14,873 --> 00:26:15,703
You should have that.

316
00:26:16,808 --> 00:26:18,708
Otherwise it'll come out like this.

317
00:26:22,747 --> 00:26:24,112
If he is alive,
take him to the hospital.

318
00:26:28,420 --> 00:26:29,910
I am not interested in it.
Go away.

319
00:26:31,222 --> 00:26:32,917
We'll give you 25 crore rupees.

320
00:26:39,631 --> 00:26:41,997
I need the money.
That's all.

321
00:26:43,435 --> 00:26:44,299
But I am not fond of it.

322
00:26:59,317 --> 00:27:01,615
Shall I settle the deal
if they offer 30 crore rupees?

323
00:27:02,587 --> 00:27:03,952
Tell them I'll do it
if they offer 40 crore rupees.

324
00:27:08,393 --> 00:27:09,621
You idiot! Drink milk.

325
00:27:11,596 --> 00:27:12,790
What you are seeing is right.

326
00:27:13,131 --> 00:27:13,995
This is a jail.

327
00:27:14,265 --> 00:27:16,028
They will do all settlements from here.

328
00:27:16,401 --> 00:27:20,804
If you think how it possible
read paper daily or watch news.

329
00:27:21,206 --> 00:27:22,173
You won't get that doubt.

330
00:27:30,015 --> 00:27:31,107
Why do you get tense Bagi?

331
00:27:31,349 --> 00:27:32,577
He said no to Jo, didn't he?

332
00:27:35,420 --> 00:27:37,251
I am also happy that he scolded her.

333
00:27:37,956 --> 00:27:38,752
Then what?

334
00:27:39,357 --> 00:27:41,120
She is glamorous than me.

335
00:27:41,726 --> 00:27:42,852
He hated her.

336
00:27:43,228 --> 00:27:44,661
Will he consider me?

337
00:27:48,366 --> 00:27:50,800
I should have told it early
that he is mine.

338
00:27:51,369 --> 00:27:52,461
I a always 10 seconds late.

339
00:27:54,039 --> 00:27:54,869
What did you say?

340
00:27:56,574 --> 00:27:57,370
In the end!

341
00:27:58,510 --> 00:28:00,205
- How long?
- 10 seconds.

342
00:28:00,779 --> 00:28:02,542
Exactly mine is also same timing sister!

343
00:28:03,048 --> 00:28:03,946
My name is bunk Seenu.

344
00:28:04,349 --> 00:28:05,976
Last year when I was
going out from my bunk..

345
00:28:06,184 --> 00:28:08,709
...I threw the cigarette to my back 10 secs
earlier thinking that I crossed it.

346
00:28:08,853 --> 00:28:10,320
- What happened?
- What will happen?

347
00:28:10,422 --> 00:28:11,548
I lost my bunk
and I remained as Seenu.

348
00:28:12,791 --> 00:28:14,281
She is 10 seconds late like money order.

349
00:28:14,426 --> 00:28:15,893
I am 10 seconds fast like telegram.

350
00:28:16,061 --> 00:28:18,029
If we both join together, we'll reach
in time like the courier.

351
00:28:18,263 --> 00:28:21,892
- Who is he?
- Basically I am very fast..

352
00:28:22,067 --> 00:28:23,432
...10 seconds early for everything..

353
00:28:23,535 --> 00:28:25,628
That's why my life swings here and there.

354
00:28:34,713 --> 00:28:36,806
- After seeing all your reports..
- Tumor? -No.

355
00:28:36,948 --> 00:28:38,973
- Cancer? -No man.
Then what else doctor?

356
00:28:39,217 --> 00:28:41,412
Has Dengue come
getting mixing Malaria and Filariasis?

357
00:28:41,753 --> 00:28:43,584
Has Typhoid come
getting mixing TB and Thyroid?

358
00:28:44,089 --> 00:28:45,989
Will heart attack come
growing BP and Sugar?

359
00:28:46,424 --> 00:28:48,255
Has AIDS come because of
a hole in condoms?

360
00:28:50,495 --> 00:28:52,963
You've a dangerous disease than all these.

361
00:28:54,365 --> 00:28:55,263
Hastiness!

362
00:28:56,234 --> 00:28:59,533
I'll collect my fees 25 thousand rupees
if I treat anyone? That's truth.

363
00:29:00,305 --> 00:29:03,604
I'll collect my fees 50 thousand rupees,
if I treat getting so hard like this.

364
00:29:04,375 --> 00:29:05,535
- Look!
- My name is Seenu.

365
00:29:06,411 --> 00:29:10,472
Look Seenu! First you listen to others.
Then you talk, ok?

366
00:29:10,982 --> 00:29:14,076
It is said that the guy who comes late,
has no discipline.

367
00:29:14,385 --> 00:29:18,344
You idiot! It is said that the guy
who comes early, has no work.

368
00:29:19,257 --> 00:29:20,121
Any doubts?

369
00:29:22,193 --> 00:29:23,217
What is the meaning of idiot?

370
00:29:24,596 --> 00:29:26,962
The person who listens
like this unnecessary things..

371
00:29:27,198 --> 00:29:31,362
...leaving important things
has been called idiot!

372
00:29:31,536 --> 00:29:32,332
Open your mouth.

373
00:29:33,004 --> 00:29:34,062
What did he tell you finally?

374
00:29:34,239 --> 00:29:36,571
He asked me to count to 10
before I start any work.

375
00:29:36,708 --> 00:29:37,504
If count?

376
00:29:37,809 --> 00:29:39,709
10 seconds gets over
if you count till 10.

377
00:29:40,678 --> 00:29:42,168
Then you'll do any work in correct time.

378
00:29:42,280 --> 00:29:43,770
He collected 50 thousand rupees
as fees for this.

379
00:29:43,882 --> 00:29:46,442
- It is right that you went to the doctor.
- What correct?

380
00:29:46,818 --> 00:29:48,843
I am speed so he asked me to count
10 numbers before I start the work.

381
00:29:49,020 --> 00:29:51,011
She is late, so he'll ask her to count
10 numbers after she finishes the work.

382
00:29:51,156 --> 00:29:53,386
She has to offer him 25 thousand
rupees as his fees. It's a waste.

383
00:29:53,892 --> 00:29:55,587
- What shall we do then?
- It's very simple sister.

384
00:29:55,693 --> 00:29:58,127
If you give me 10 thousand rupees,
I'll make a call to him.

385
00:29:58,229 --> 00:30:00,322
He'll give me an idea
and I'll tell it to you.

386
00:30:00,632 --> 00:30:02,463
You can save 15 thousand rupees
from the fees..

387
00:30:02,567 --> 00:30:03,932
...and I'll cover 10 thousand
rupees in my loss.

388
00:30:06,171 --> 00:30:08,264
Oh gosh! Here 1,000 rupees
also resemble like 10,000 rupees.

389
00:30:08,373 --> 00:30:09,271
I'll take it later from you.

390
00:30:18,183 --> 00:30:21,346
- Sir! It's me, Seenu!
- Tell me.

391
00:30:21,786 --> 00:30:25,517
- Sir! A girl of my friend is
in love problem. -Look ahead.

392
00:30:26,324 --> 00:30:28,349
Ok sir! I'll call you
after seeing the boy.

393
00:30:29,327 --> 00:30:30,487
He isn't yet cured.

394
00:30:31,563 --> 00:30:32,427
Where can I see him?

395
00:30:41,739 --> 00:30:45,300
Don't know why girls are loving
and whom they are loving.

396
00:30:45,944 --> 00:30:47,707
It's ok. What is the use
of thinking it now?

397
00:30:51,149 --> 00:30:54,846
Sister! This time not like you,
go early 10 seconds like me.

398
00:30:55,019 --> 00:30:57,317
You go I'll tell you.
Go and flatter him.

399
00:31:07,699 --> 00:31:09,724
- He was enquiring about you.
- Why?

400
00:31:10,368 --> 00:31:12,233
I was asking him why
he rejected your friend Jo.

401
00:31:12,503 --> 00:31:13,333
Why?

402
00:31:13,638 --> 00:31:14,434
Give me your hand.

403
00:31:16,040 --> 00:31:17,064
Earth revolves around the Sun..

404
00:31:17,375 --> 00:31:18,342
...The Moon revolves around the Earth..

405
00:31:18,443 --> 00:31:20,741
...Poets and people like me
revolve around the Moon.

406
00:31:20,879 --> 00:31:21,743
That is science.

407
00:31:22,046 --> 00:31:24,071
If boys roam around the girls,
it's romance.

408
00:31:24,449 --> 00:31:27,680
If girls roam around the boys,
it is nonsense.

409
00:31:29,087 --> 00:31:31,555
Girls shouldn't be like hills.

410
00:31:31,656 --> 00:31:32,748
Everyone will come there.

411
00:31:33,591 --> 00:31:34,580
They should be like peaks.

412
00:31:35,260 --> 00:31:37,091
Remember one thing.

413
00:31:37,595 --> 00:31:39,358
Some guys meet on Friday..
go to pub on Saturday..

414
00:31:39,530 --> 00:31:41,964
Do a party on Sunday..
and part on Monday.

415
00:31:42,400 --> 00:31:44,630
That's why you should be tight.

416
00:31:47,405 --> 00:31:48,963
- She tightened herself.
- Has she?

417
00:31:51,409 --> 00:31:52,706
I have some thesis on this topic..

418
00:31:52,810 --> 00:31:54,243
Whenever you get the leisure
time in the evening..

419
00:31:54,345 --> 00:31:55,141
...come, I'll teach you.

420
00:31:56,214 --> 00:31:58,705
If you want to see how
he pays the bill after losing it..

421
00:31:58,883 --> 00:32:01,181
...keep watching your news channel TV9.

422
00:32:01,419 --> 00:32:03,114
Hey Sanjay
Stop there!

423
00:32:03,821 --> 00:32:05,789
It is the bail petition of A1 accused
Chegunta Damodhar Reddy..

424
00:32:05,957 --> 00:32:09,085
...belonging to the murder
which happened in Kalwakurthi dam.

425
00:32:14,098 --> 00:32:15,326
It is third time your
bail petition is getting rejected..

426
00:32:15,500 --> 00:32:17,491
What is your comment on this?

427
00:32:17,635 --> 00:32:19,728
Your opponents are telling you're
also the one among 4 people..

428
00:32:20,038 --> 00:32:21,403
...who has a criminal
history in Rayalaseema.

429
00:32:21,572 --> 00:32:23,938
Is the court going to prove it?
Zoom it.

430
00:32:27,111 --> 00:32:31,810
If I would be the rude criminal,
would you dare to ask this question..

431
00:32:32,116 --> 00:32:33,208
...or can you go home
safely after asking it?

432
00:32:41,392 --> 00:32:43,553
- Haven't you got the bail?
- No.

433
00:32:43,728 --> 00:32:45,252
That lawyer is a waste fellow.
Let's kill him.

434
00:32:48,266 --> 00:32:49,324
It's enough to transfer him.

435
00:32:49,934 --> 00:32:52,095
We should seek higher
officials help to transfer him.

436
00:32:52,337 --> 00:32:53,770
It's enough to hold a knife to kill him.

437
00:32:54,739 --> 00:32:56,434
- Think for a while.
- Ok.

438
00:32:56,641 --> 00:32:57,437
Are you going to the jail...?

439
00:32:57,809 --> 00:32:59,299
I have some work on the way.
I'll see it and come there.

440
00:32:59,544 --> 00:33:00,977
- What is this sir?
- I'll take care of it.

441
00:33:11,689 --> 00:33:13,452
You don't get tense.
I'll talk to the boss.

442
00:33:49,127 --> 00:33:50,822
Sir!
He is our Reddy sir!

443
00:33:51,396 --> 00:33:52,226
Stop it.

444
00:33:56,067 --> 00:34:00,629
- We have come..
- I didn't stop to listen to you.

445
00:34:01,706 --> 00:34:04,937
It is for you to listen to what I say.

446
00:34:07,478 --> 00:34:10,345
He says that he won't listen to us
and we should listen to him.

447
00:34:10,481 --> 00:34:11,573
That's why he stopped it.

448
00:34:13,451 --> 00:34:15,612
I paid the right price to buy this land.

449
00:34:16,621 --> 00:34:18,851
Don't tr to show your strength to me.

450
00:34:20,291 --> 00:34:24,591
If you show you're a rowdy,
I'll show I am a don.

451
00:34:25,496 --> 00:34:27,361
Then your plight will become miserable.

452
00:34:33,237 --> 00:34:34,226
He says that it won't work out.

453
00:34:35,106 --> 00:34:36,869
Is that all what he has told so far?

454
00:34:38,509 --> 00:34:40,943
It'll be the meaning of his total words.

455
00:34:41,112 --> 00:34:42,807
Ok, tell me what he has told in Hindi.

456
00:34:42,980 --> 00:34:44,038
Don't tell me whatever Hindi you know.

457
00:34:46,584 --> 00:34:49,052
We're just local rowdies
and he is a mafia don.

458
00:34:49,253 --> 00:34:52,711
If we tr to show him our muscles,
he knows what to show us.

459
00:34:52,790 --> 00:34:54,587
Then he showed the gun
from the window.

460
00:34:54,659 --> 00:34:58,356
I've to talk to him.
He wants to talk to you.

461
00:34:59,664 --> 00:35:01,564
- Tell him do the work.
- Do the work.

462
00:35:08,272 --> 00:35:09,398
Why isn't sir talking?

463
00:35:09,540 --> 00:35:10,905
He seems not to listen to sir.

464
00:35:11,676 --> 00:35:13,769
He came and he left too.

465
00:36:41,365 --> 00:36:42,229
Wait!

466
00:36:45,436 --> 00:36:48,200
I didn't stop it to listen to you.

467
00:36:48,839 --> 00:36:50,363
To make you listen to me.

468
00:36:50,641 --> 00:36:53,075
We didn't stop it to listen to you.

469
00:36:53,444 --> 00:36:54,570
To make you listen to him.

470
00:37:02,286 --> 00:37:08,088
If you want to do business here, learn to
get scared along with buying and building.

471
00:37:11,896 --> 00:37:13,557
No need for language for threaten.

472
00:37:14,565 --> 00:37:15,657
He'll understand.

473
00:37:27,311 --> 00:37:31,008
Wipe both that blood, his name
and write your name there.

474
00:37:34,318 --> 00:37:35,478
- Hey man!
- Sami!

475
00:37:36,520 --> 00:37:42,083
If you have a leisure time, ask him
to seek pardon from me in Telugu.

476
00:37:43,394 --> 00:37:44,452
His voice is very good.

477
00:37:57,742 --> 00:37:58,572
I am coming.

478
00:38:05,483 --> 00:38:06,279
Where is the door?

479
00:38:09,020 --> 00:38:12,251
It means we shouldn't lose our prestige
and he should become crazy to you.

480
00:38:12,556 --> 00:38:13,386
Is it?

481
00:38:15,760 --> 00:38:18,991
It looks like learning cycling
without getting hurt.

482
00:38:20,298 --> 00:38:21,424
Why should we break our heads?

483
00:38:21,632 --> 00:38:23,497
We have paid him, isn't it?
Let's ask him.

484
00:38:24,068 --> 00:38:24,898
She is my daughter, sir.

485
00:38:25,836 --> 00:38:27,667
Nowadays she is behaving differently.

486
00:38:27,772 --> 00:38:28,796
To show you..

487
00:38:57,601 --> 00:39:00,161
That sir! She is behaving
a little hot like this.

488
00:39:00,338 --> 00:39:02,636
She isn't behaving
a little hot, Subba Rao?

489
00:39:02,940 --> 00:39:05,636
- It's craziness.
- What should I do now?

490
00:39:10,614 --> 00:39:14,311
- Guruji! It's me Seenu.
- What?

491
00:39:14,752 --> 00:39:17,243
As you said I saw that boy.
He looks very handsome.

492
00:39:18,155 --> 00:39:20,851
- Did I tell you?
- Don't crack jokes in this matters.

493
00:39:20,958 --> 00:39:22,391
The girl likes him very much.

494
00:39:22,560 --> 00:39:24,994
- Whose girl?
- I don't know her father's name.

495
00:39:26,497 --> 00:39:29,193
Why do you call me?
What wrong have I done to you?

496
00:39:29,500 --> 00:39:30,694
You can scold sir.

497
00:39:30,835 --> 00:39:32,097
You are senior
so you can scold me..

498
00:39:32,236 --> 00:39:33,396
I am junior, so I'll bear it.

499
00:39:33,504 --> 00:39:35,972
- What should she do now?
- What should I do sir?

500
00:39:37,174 --> 00:39:38,198
What to do now?

501
00:39:38,376 --> 00:39:40,071
It'll be better if met regularly.

502
00:39:40,244 --> 00:39:42,542
Should she meet him?
This hint is enough, sir.

503
00:39:42,646 --> 00:39:44,011
I'll perform her marriage in 10 days.

504
00:39:46,717 --> 00:39:48,685
When will you learn
how to talk on the phone?

505
00:39:48,786 --> 00:39:50,754
Why do you consider
the answer to them as yours?

506
00:39:51,322 --> 00:39:52,346
Damn marriage!

507
00:39:52,456 --> 00:39:54,424
Is there any use performing her marriage?

508
00:39:54,658 --> 00:39:55,522
Why not?

509
00:39:55,793 --> 00:39:57,488
You can bring her here 2 days in a week.

510
00:39:57,661 --> 00:39:59,094
Your son-in-law will bring
her in another 2 days.

511
00:39:59,663 --> 00:40:01,756
You should meet
him regularly, that's all.

512
00:40:03,534 --> 00:40:04,660
How can I meet him without any work?

513
00:40:04,769 --> 00:40:06,498
Normal people wait for reasons.

514
00:40:06,670 --> 00:40:09,605
But lovers like you
create reasons.

515
00:40:09,874 --> 00:40:11,171
What did he tell you yesterday?

516
00:40:11,475 --> 00:40:12,965
Meeting on Friday..

517
00:40:17,148 --> 00:40:18,376
I have a thesis on this topic.

518
00:40:18,482 --> 00:40:20,609
Whenever you get the leisure time
in the evening, come I'll teach you.

519
00:40:21,952 --> 00:40:23,920
Isn't it enough to make
the things turn in our favour?

520
00:40:24,021 --> 00:40:25,852
So you are going
to meet him today evening.

521
00:40:25,956 --> 00:40:27,719
You don't worry.
I am with you. Do it well.

522
00:40:27,825 --> 00:40:29,122
If you get any doubts,
call me..

523
00:40:44,508 --> 00:40:47,671
Why didn't you tell me
that it's a dog van?

524
00:40:48,179 --> 00:40:49,476
Before I could tell you..

525
00:40:53,784 --> 00:40:54,876
Did they bite you very hard?

526
00:40:59,857 --> 00:41:01,825
Seems dogs are using Colgate paste.

527
00:41:01,926 --> 00:41:04,486
Their teeth are very strong.

528
00:41:16,273 --> 00:41:17,103
What are you doing here?

529
00:41:17,675 --> 00:41:21,441
You told me that if I meet you,
you'll tell me about girls nature

530
00:41:22,413 --> 00:41:24,210
I told it generally.
Did you take it seriously?

531
00:41:24,882 --> 00:41:27,510
Look Bagi! Nowadays girls
are roaming around boys.

532
00:41:27,751 --> 00:41:28,809
But in the olden days it wasn't like that.

533
00:41:28,886 --> 00:41:30,979
Even they don't even look at men.

534
00:41:31,222 --> 00:41:35,716
Moreover, when Rama was fighting
over the bridge with demons..

535
00:41:35,826 --> 00:41:37,589
...Sita just laid down under the tree.

536
00:41:37,828 --> 00:41:41,457
But she didn't climb the tree and
looked at Rama how he was. No.

537
00:41:41,832 --> 00:41:45,268
Devadas drank bottles
of liquor for Parvathi..

538
00:41:45,369 --> 00:41:49,931
...did Parvathi drink a peg
of liquor for Devadas? -No.

539
00:41:50,174 --> 00:41:52,142
So, what do you understand from this?

540
00:41:52,710 --> 00:41:55,008
You flattering us and
we getting flattered, both are normal.

541
00:41:56,647 --> 00:41:57,477
How is it?

542
00:41:57,715 --> 00:41:59,740
A guy is coming from the way.

543
00:42:00,317 --> 00:42:01,716
Let him come.
Don't look at him.

544
00:42:01,986 --> 00:42:04,580
He will be going..
let him go but don't look at him.

545
00:42:04,755 --> 00:42:06,985
More..
A little more..

546
00:42:07,391 --> 00:42:11,350
When almost he is going away,
throw your glance at him.

547
00:42:12,596 --> 00:42:14,757
Not directly,
in a side angle..

548
00:42:15,266 --> 00:42:16,358
How is it?

549
00:42:16,667 --> 00:42:18,897
How do I say an English girl like you?

550
00:42:19,203 --> 00:42:21,296
- Like diagonally!
- Diagonally!

551
00:42:22,406 --> 00:42:25,239
At that time he'll look at you,
you smile at him.

552
00:42:25,876 --> 00:42:28,310
Smile with your eyes
but not with your teeth.

553
00:42:28,546 --> 00:42:29,774
How can you smile with eyes?

554
00:42:29,880 --> 00:42:32,872
Now.. not that..
Keep your smile from here..

555
00:42:33,217 --> 00:42:36,186
...take it like that..
you close here..

556
00:42:36,453 --> 00:42:37,317
There will come
a glow in your eyes..

557
00:42:37,888 --> 00:42:39,651
He'll ruin with that glow..

558
00:42:45,296 --> 00:42:46,194
Now the theory is completed.

559
00:42:46,297 --> 00:42:49,061
We need a first class idiot
to do it practically. Found one.

560
00:42:50,301 --> 00:42:51,233
Look! He is coming there.

561
00:42:52,836 --> 00:42:54,929
He is coming with the stripes shirt.
He is looking at you.

562
00:42:55,039 --> 00:42:56,063
Let's make him fall down.

563
00:42:56,373 --> 00:43:00,400
Don't look!
Let him go.

564
00:43:00,644 --> 00:43:03,272
Keep your eyes down.
Now look at him.

565
00:43:06,116 --> 00:43:08,812
Throw a smile with your eyes.

566
00:43:20,197 --> 00:43:22,290
How did he know that
I saw him from my behind?

567
00:43:22,399 --> 00:43:25,266
If anyone wants us to look at them
our glance will pierce their back.

568
00:43:27,671 --> 00:43:30,640
Girl! I am giving you all my power.
Use it as you like.

569
00:43:30,874 --> 00:43:31,738
Thank you Swami!

570
00:43:32,810 --> 00:43:35,301
Meanwhile I'll go shopping.
You enjoy it.

571
00:43:36,013 --> 00:43:36,809
Shall I come with you?

572
00:43:37,948 --> 00:43:39,381
I want to buy briefs for me.
Will you come?

573
00:43:39,483 --> 00:43:41,041
- No.
- No. Then go.

574
00:43:54,031 --> 00:43:55,589
Isn't it ladies hostel?

575
00:43:57,568 --> 00:43:58,364
What is all this?

576
00:44:01,839 --> 00:44:04,330
Boys are not allowed
inside the compound.

577
00:44:04,508 --> 00:44:05,532
The warden won't keep quiet.

578
00:44:08,045 --> 00:44:10,275
They don't bother if they run a family
outside the compound, isn't it?

579
00:44:12,983 --> 00:44:15,178
It's good.

580
00:44:22,126 --> 00:44:23,024
Come here.

581
00:44:26,864 --> 00:44:28,491
The situation is very dangerous here.

582
00:44:28,599 --> 00:44:31,625
As soon as possible
find a room outside and shift.

583
00:44:31,935 --> 00:44:33,300
Tr to understand
why I am telling to you!

584
00:44:46,750 --> 00:44:47,580
Have you called me?

585
00:45:21,952 --> 00:45:27,982
My heart is beating in some
strange manner, know it,

586
00:45:29,026 --> 00:45:35,022
My heart is moving aimlessly
Don't know how long to wait,

587
00:45:36,166 --> 00:45:43,004
My lips are not uttering
the word which is in the heart,

588
00:45:43,240 --> 00:45:48,576
it'll be found out
when searched in the eyes,

589
00:45:49,113 --> 00:45:52,276
Tea spoon is visible
as a long one in front of eyes,

590
00:45:52,783 --> 00:45:55,809
The fool Moon is making me agitate,

591
00:45:56,320 --> 00:45:59,483
Cloud nine has come under the foot,

592
00:45:59,790 --> 00:46:04,250
Land mine blasts in the heart,

593
00:46:43,033 --> 00:46:49,597
Has any storm attacked you suddenly?

594
00:46:50,174 --> 00:46:56,579
Has it sunk the heart into
the elation which hasn't before?

595
00:46:57,181 --> 00:47:00,446
The burden of the breath
won't rise up unnecessarily.

596
00:47:00,551 --> 00:47:03,679
Your appearance is in
the whole of my body.

597
00:47:04,188 --> 00:47:07,419
Let the thoughts make you
to roam here and there.

598
00:47:07,624 --> 00:47:11,492
Are you alone trying to extinguish
the feelings with the pillow?

599
00:47:12,329 --> 00:47:19,235
When the cell gets your message
it'll be like the stun gun firing,

600
00:47:19,603 --> 00:47:27,510
When ceiling fan blows,
it'll be like a touch of the cyclone,

601
00:47:49,099 --> 00:47:51,124
Has he come in terms?
Tell me.

602
00:47:51,768 --> 00:47:52,666
He is coming into my dreams.

603
00:47:53,837 --> 00:47:55,202
Don't be satisfied that
he is coming into your dreams.

604
00:47:55,305 --> 00:47:56,431
I'll make him lay on your lap.

605
00:47:58,041 --> 00:47:59,474
- Sir!
What is the matter?

606
00:47:59,843 --> 00:48:02,368
- My two brother-in-laws are crazy.
- What is the wonder in that?

607
00:48:02,512 --> 00:48:04,537
- The elder one beats everyone.
- Like you.

608
00:48:04,848 --> 00:48:06,941
The second one takes tablets
wherever he sees one.

609
00:48:07,784 --> 00:48:09,809
Sir! It's me, Seenu.

610
00:48:10,053 --> 00:48:11,611
Didn't we setup
a love affair last time?

611
00:48:11,722 --> 00:48:13,690
- It's my fate.
- What should they do now?

612
00:48:13,924 --> 00:48:15,357
What should they both do?

613
00:48:16,393 --> 00:48:17,223
Wait a minute.

614
00:48:17,728 --> 00:48:19,025
Ask them to stay in one place.

615
00:48:19,730 --> 00:48:23,166
- It's extraordinary, sir.
- He won't come good.

616
00:48:23,634 --> 00:48:25,829
You are not telling at all
how our guys can get cured.

617
00:48:26,203 --> 00:48:27,568
The elder one beats the younger one..

618
00:48:27,804 --> 00:48:29,431
The younger one takes tablets
for that beats..

619
00:48:29,606 --> 00:48:30,903
I'll be happy.

620
00:48:31,208 --> 00:48:32,971
He is asking both of you
should stay in one place.

621
00:48:33,810 --> 00:48:34,936
There is a penthouse in his house.

622
00:48:35,279 --> 00:48:37,406
- How can I go there suddenly?
- By the car.

623
00:48:40,350 --> 00:48:42,350
What did he tell
you day before yesterday?

624
00:48:47,291 --> 00:48:50,192
As soon as possible find a room
outside and shift.

625
00:48:51,228 --> 00:48:52,195
That's why you are going.

626
00:48:59,636 --> 00:49:01,069
What are you doing here?
Aren't you going to your place?

627
00:49:01,305 --> 00:49:03,466
Is it you who is going
to shift into the first floor?

628
00:49:04,908 --> 00:49:05,738
What about the hostel?

629
00:49:06,843 --> 00:49:08,333
You told me not to stay there.

630
00:49:08,445 --> 00:49:10,345
What is she? I told it generally,
but she took it seriously.

631
00:49:10,580 --> 00:49:11,478
It's very good man.

632
00:49:15,852 --> 00:49:16,682
I'll send it.
You go.

633
00:49:17,454 --> 00:49:18,614
You go happily.

634
00:49:21,591 --> 00:49:24,091
She would've taken it herself.
Why do you bother?

635
00:49:24,127 --> 00:49:25,287
I didn't say that I'll carr these.

636
00:49:25,595 --> 00:49:28,155
I said that I'll send it.
Don't stare. Carr it.

637
00:50:06,303 --> 00:50:12,867
I don't know myself
how would I behave,

638
00:50:13,410 --> 00:50:19,781
My respect grows every time
when I converse with you,

639
00:50:20,250 --> 00:50:23,651
My feet makes me
roam around you,

640
00:50:23,854 --> 00:50:26,948
The lust of tune is
growing inside the heart,

641
00:50:27,391 --> 00:50:30,724
The dreams are calling
the heart softly,

642
00:50:30,927 --> 00:50:34,886
The joy is making me
move forward anxiously,

643
00:50:35,799 --> 00:50:42,602
The freedom is
welcoming to fly in the air,

644
00:50:43,040 --> 00:50:50,879
My life moves as a
heart pierced by an arrow,

645
00:51:40,397 --> 00:51:42,092
Sir! Look!
It is him.

646
00:51:44,935 --> 00:51:46,800
- Be careful Sami!
Be careful sir!

647
00:51:47,537 --> 00:51:50,506
- Be careful sir!
- Take the vehicle to the left.

648
00:51:55,545 --> 00:51:59,379
Be careful, sir!

649
00:52:03,286 --> 00:52:04,981
Sir! Our boss is going.

650
00:53:10,020 --> 00:53:12,113
- Sir! -Leave me.
- Listen to me.

651
00:53:12,355 --> 00:53:13,253
Now we have to go to jail.

652
00:53:13,423 --> 00:53:15,584
- Before that he should go
to the graveyard. -Sir!

653
00:53:16,960 --> 00:53:21,192
Search for the guy who roams on
AP-09 AP 7475 bike in this whole city.

654
00:53:21,531 --> 00:53:24,261
I want to know all his
history in 24 hours.

655
00:54:42,979 --> 00:54:43,877
Ask him to come back.

656
00:54:44,047 --> 00:54:45,537
They have struggled for 2 days.

657
00:54:45,649 --> 00:54:48,550
He is in the right position
it's enough to press trigger..

658
00:54:48,985 --> 00:54:55,788
He feels that a 4m. red iron
rod piercing into his forehead.

659
00:54:55,959 --> 00:54:57,654
He'll die before he gets the pain.

660
00:54:58,395 --> 00:55:00,420
Like doing operation
with chloroform injection..

661
00:55:02,399 --> 00:55:05,163
...are we doctors to kill him
without giving pain?

662
00:55:06,569 --> 00:55:09,902
He should yell out
when he dies, should cr and..

663
00:55:10,740 --> 00:55:14,232
...should beg at our feet to leave him.

664
00:55:15,211 --> 00:55:19,341
Without that fun if you kill him,
what joy will be there?

665
00:55:22,619 --> 00:55:25,247
- Sami asks you to come back.
- Why?

666
00:55:25,722 --> 00:55:28,247
This is not like questioning me but him.

667
00:55:29,225 --> 00:55:30,055
Want you ask him?

668
00:55:54,084 --> 00:55:55,551
- I put red coin down.
- Hit the follow coin.

669
00:55:55,952 --> 00:55:56,816
Who is it?

670
00:56:01,791 --> 00:56:02,883
Why have you called now?

671
00:56:04,260 --> 00:56:05,352
Have you remembered me?
Is it?

672
00:56:05,795 --> 00:56:07,729
Truly? Tell it to kids.

673
00:56:08,131 --> 00:56:09,758
There are no phone calls for 10 days.

674
00:56:10,166 --> 00:56:10,962
You are saying that
you remembered me?

675
00:56:11,067 --> 00:56:12,967
I think it's his lover.
He is talking so affectionately.

676
00:56:13,737 --> 00:56:14,635
It is your girlfriend.

677
00:56:15,338 --> 00:56:17,704
Is it my lover?
Give me the phone.

678
00:56:18,842 --> 00:56:20,776
How many times I told you
not to call me at this time?

679
00:56:20,944 --> 00:56:21,774
Put it down.

680
00:56:22,479 --> 00:56:23,503
He isn't a ordinary person
who lifted the phone.

681
00:56:23,613 --> 00:56:24,477
He is a smart guy.

682
00:56:24,614 --> 00:56:25,512
Tr to understand
why I am saying it.

683
00:56:26,416 --> 00:56:28,976
- What?
- My car got repaired.

684
00:56:29,085 --> 00:56:31,986
- Then! -There is
a reception of my friend's.

685
00:56:32,222 --> 00:56:33,052
Then!

686
00:56:34,357 --> 00:56:36,086
- I want to go to the parlour.
- Go.

687
00:56:36,359 --> 00:56:38,350
- Will you come with me?
- He'll come.

688
00:56:39,429 --> 00:56:42,125
- Abi! Take her to the beauty parlour.
- Yes sir.

689
00:56:42,365 --> 00:56:43,889
- Decorate her well..
- Yes sir.

690
00:56:44,100 --> 00:56:46,068
Take her to the reception, make her eat
the food and take her to the house.

691
00:56:47,036 --> 00:56:49,163
I've not enough time to do the labour work
Find some other guy.

692
00:56:49,272 --> 00:56:50,136
What labour work?

693
00:56:50,240 --> 00:56:51,400
Do you know what will happen
if you don't go with her?

694
00:56:51,508 --> 00:56:52,304
What will happen?

695
00:57:12,462 --> 00:57:13,861
You controlled him very well.

696
00:57:16,800 --> 00:57:17,664
This is the right time.

697
00:57:17,867 --> 00:57:21,359
If you give him that too,
he'll roam around you like a puppy.

698
00:57:24,541 --> 00:57:26,099
You are like my sister,
I can't tell you more than this.

699
00:57:29,679 --> 00:57:31,510
- Is it you? -Yes sir.
How is your health?

700
00:57:31,614 --> 00:57:34,242
- I am fine sir.
- Who is it?

701
00:57:34,751 --> 00:57:36,480
Didn't I tell you on the phone?
It is her.

702
00:57:37,620 --> 00:57:40,248
She looks amorous.
She looks pretty.

703
00:57:40,690 --> 00:57:41,850
Lights and plates are good.

704
00:57:42,091 --> 00:57:43,183
But food isn't good.

705
00:57:50,300 --> 00:57:52,928
- You.. -I brought her here
when her car got repaired.

706
00:57:54,037 --> 00:57:56,801
- Is it that car?
- That only.

707
00:57:57,507 --> 00:58:00,476
The car looks good, isn't it?

708
00:58:01,911 --> 00:58:04,675
Did she prepare well going to the parlour
by telling the car got repaired?

709
00:58:06,716 --> 00:58:09,344
When I told her that I am going to Sagar
she gave me her car at once.

710
00:58:09,719 --> 00:58:10,811
I got a little doubt then.

711
00:58:11,721 --> 00:58:14,019
That's why I cancelled my programme
and came here.

712
00:58:19,696 --> 00:58:21,596
He rejected you
when you proposed to him.

713
00:58:21,798 --> 00:58:23,629
He thought like that
but I didn't think like that.

714
00:58:25,134 --> 00:58:27,068
Don't anyone of you bother here
to know what I am thinking?

715
00:58:27,403 --> 00:58:28,199
What are you thinking?

716
00:58:29,339 --> 00:58:31,500
Are you thinking that
she is a beauty? Look!

717
00:58:31,674 --> 00:58:33,505
We can't see her
when she isn't in her make-up.

718
00:58:33,610 --> 00:58:35,237
She can't see properly
without her spectacles.

719
00:58:43,419 --> 00:58:45,011
Spectacles!

720
00:58:46,556 --> 00:58:47,989
Do you need a spectacles for your face?

721
00:58:48,758 --> 00:58:50,248
You didn't tell
that you wear spectacles.

722
00:58:50,760 --> 00:58:51,727
You are a big liar.

723
00:58:52,495 --> 00:58:53,894
Doing all the mischief..

724
00:58:54,097 --> 00:58:55,792
Like she is a police and
I am the thief..

725
00:58:57,901 --> 00:58:58,731
Are you trying to kill me?

726
00:59:02,171 --> 00:59:03,661
Stop it.
No sorry.

727
00:59:03,773 --> 00:59:05,400
It's enough what you did.
Stop it.

728
00:59:12,115 --> 00:59:15,175
- She is crying, sir.
- I can't get it.

729
00:59:15,518 --> 00:59:16,815
She hit him.
Then why is she crying?

730
00:59:16,920 --> 00:59:18,410
Give an idea, sir.

731
00:59:18,521 --> 00:59:20,216
Else he'll go on the bike
and she'll go in the car.

732
00:59:20,390 --> 00:59:22,255
- Please tell me something.
- Draw air from it.

733
00:59:23,893 --> 00:59:24,917
You united a couple.

734
00:59:26,596 --> 00:59:27,426
He won't come good.

735
00:59:45,815 --> 00:59:47,180
My car tire got flat.

736
00:59:48,351 --> 00:59:49,716
Really, I didn't do anything.

737
00:59:50,520 --> 00:59:51,987
I don't know how it happened

738
00:59:53,890 --> 00:59:57,451
I lost my lenses and
couldn't find glasses.

739
00:59:58,494 --> 00:59:59,722
It is raining.

740
01:00:01,097 --> 01:00:02,325
I don't know anyone around here.

741
01:00:04,300 --> 01:00:05,198
I feel very cold.

742
01:00:26,589 --> 01:00:28,147
If you cr I'll pierce into your neck.
Stop it.

743
01:00:28,725 --> 01:00:30,283
You did everything and crying now.

744
01:00:32,195 --> 01:00:33,162
Why are you crying again?

745
01:00:45,608 --> 01:00:47,337
You don't lack in these formalities.

746
01:00:49,812 --> 01:00:50,744
Come here.

747
01:00:53,616 --> 01:00:54,583
Come near.
I won't eat you.

748
01:00:58,287 --> 01:01:00,983
Look Bagi! Beauty means
you should be your own.

749
01:01:01,758 --> 01:01:04,659
But not to be like to others.
Understood?

750
01:01:24,447 --> 01:01:27,075
Brother Sanjay! Send a little one here.

751
01:01:29,585 --> 01:01:33,214
He is a good person.
When I ask he does it.

752
01:01:39,328 --> 01:01:40,226
It's over.

753
01:01:45,068 --> 01:01:46,160
You should have done it before.

754
01:01:49,605 --> 01:01:51,470
Doctor advised you not
to drink too much alcohol.

755
01:01:51,574 --> 01:01:53,235
But you are having it.
You'll die early.

756
01:01:53,342 --> 01:01:54,172
I won't die so soon.

757
01:01:54,343 --> 01:01:56,004
I'll take you along with me when I go.

758
01:02:01,984 --> 01:02:03,747
- To where?
- Upstairs.

759
01:02:03,820 --> 01:02:05,913
- Why? -Ice is over.
I want to go and get it.

760
01:02:15,698 --> 01:02:16,528
Did I disturb you?

761
01:02:19,435 --> 01:02:20,527
Is it Malleshwari?

762
01:02:22,572 --> 01:02:25,166
- Have you stopped to cr?
- Yes.

763
01:02:25,842 --> 01:02:28,208
- Can I get ice here?
- Sit down.

764
01:02:29,112 --> 01:02:32,013
- Why are you calling me
with respect? -Sit.

765
01:02:47,663 --> 01:02:49,961
- Do you know it is my favourite song?
- I know it.

766
01:02:53,269 --> 01:02:54,497
Banumathi madam gives
good face expressions!

767
01:02:57,073 --> 01:03:00,839
- What?
- First wear the spectacles.

768
01:03:01,811 --> 01:03:03,039
Who asked you to remove it?

769
01:03:04,080 --> 01:03:05,513
You don't look pretty without it either.

770
01:03:07,884 --> 01:03:09,784
Sorry Bagi, I said it in a flow.

771
01:03:14,824 --> 01:03:16,792
- Do you want more?
- Do you have?

772
01:03:19,629 --> 01:03:20,994
Do you have the stock in the house?

773
01:03:30,973 --> 01:03:31,940
Are you also drinking this brand?

774
01:03:32,642 --> 01:03:34,405
- I don't drink.
- Then?

775
01:03:35,244 --> 01:03:36,142
I thought you'll come..

776
01:03:38,314 --> 01:03:39,611
Did you guess that
I would come here?

777
01:03:44,720 --> 01:03:45,584
Say one thing.

778
01:03:46,055 --> 01:03:47,545
Didn't you come here wantonly?

779
01:03:51,194 --> 01:03:56,154
I made old tenants vacate
by offering 25 thousand rupees bribe.

780
01:03:56,732 --> 01:03:59,758
You thief!
Bribe?

781
01:04:01,604 --> 01:04:04,539
Meeting you at the shopping
complex that day..

782
01:04:06,943 --> 01:04:08,877
...when I offered a full bottle
to Abi, he told it.

783
01:04:09,212 --> 01:04:11,442
Did you give a full bottle to Abi?

784
01:04:13,015 --> 01:04:14,380
All these crimes took
place in my kingdom.

785
01:04:14,617 --> 01:04:16,676
Did he take bribe from you?

786
01:04:18,487 --> 01:04:19,715
I can't get it.

787
01:04:20,356 --> 01:04:23,325
What do both of us lack?
We are being like friends.

788
01:04:23,693 --> 01:04:24,625
We often meet in university.

789
01:04:24,727 --> 01:04:25,955
And I am staying in downstairs,
you are in upstairs.

790
01:04:26,229 --> 01:04:27,491
What else do you want than this?

791
01:04:30,233 --> 01:04:33,031
Is this a drink that you want more?

792
01:04:34,770 --> 01:04:36,863
I want you totally.

793
01:04:37,440 --> 01:04:39,533
Totally?
Am I a thing?

794
01:04:40,576 --> 01:04:42,203
Are you a girl?

795
01:04:44,113 --> 01:04:44,909
Indeed you are a girl.

796
01:04:47,183 --> 01:04:49,014
Look at me once!
Lift your head up and see.

797
01:04:50,319 --> 01:04:51,752
Have you learnt shyness?

798
01:04:52,855 --> 01:04:55,824
I am not looking handsome.
Listen to me.

799
01:04:56,459 --> 01:04:59,155
You'll get a husband with
trim body as brandy. Go with him.

800
01:05:04,800 --> 01:05:07,394
Listen to me Bagi!
Wait once!

801
01:05:10,907 --> 01:05:12,238
Why don't you listen to me?

802
01:05:13,209 --> 01:05:14,506
I am not a match for you.

803
01:05:18,948 --> 01:05:21,041
- You can't bear me.
- I can bear you.

804
01:05:22,218 --> 01:05:25,654
What can you bear?
Damn it!

805
01:05:25,888 --> 01:05:27,515
Haven't you seen how I behaved
staying half an hour in your room?

806
01:05:27,623 --> 01:05:28,612
I behaved too much.

807
01:05:28,824 --> 01:05:30,189
No problem. I can adjust it.

808
01:05:30,960 --> 01:05:33,121
- I'll scold when I booze.
- I'll listen to it.

809
01:05:33,829 --> 01:05:35,990
- I'll hit also.
- I can bear it.

810
01:05:36,766 --> 01:05:38,734
Oh God! How can I make
this girl understand?

811
01:05:45,908 --> 01:05:46,806
What did you say?

812
01:06:09,665 --> 01:06:11,599
- I can't breathe properly.
- You said that you'll bear it.

813
01:06:12,201 --> 01:06:12,997
Bear it.

814
01:06:58,748 --> 01:07:02,582
Feel like flying in the air,
as a blasting heart,

815
01:07:02,785 --> 01:07:06,721
And feel like hitting the
honey thread with a stone,

816
01:07:10,826 --> 01:07:14,660
Feel like the body shaking,
smoking a fag,

817
01:07:14,764 --> 01:07:18,700
And feel like boozing a full bottle,

818
01:07:23,305 --> 01:07:30,677
Who are you to my eyes?
An angel or a demon or a lover?

819
01:07:31,380 --> 01:07:38,616
Who are you to my mind?
A breath or a dream or swing?

820
01:08:11,287 --> 01:08:15,246
Dreams are coming in the sleep
and call is coming through the lips,

821
01:08:15,357 --> 01:08:18,520
the heart is rising up
inside beyond my control,

822
01:08:19,395 --> 01:08:23,195
My youth is coming out and
my cheeks are becoming red,

823
01:08:23,432 --> 01:08:27,198
and I myself rising up
at your thoughts,

824
01:08:27,436 --> 01:08:34,808
Who are you to my desire?
Colours or wings or directions?

825
01:08:35,578 --> 01:08:43,041
Who are you to my youth?
A bee or a naughty or hastiness?

826
01:09:47,550 --> 01:09:51,452
Desire is coming into the thoughts
and affection is coming into the shyness,

827
01:09:51,587 --> 01:09:54,613
and the youth is coming out into me,

828
01:09:55,658 --> 01:09:59,424
Eyes gain prominence,
feet feel like running,

829
01:09:59,595 --> 01:10:03,497
and joy goes out of limits
at your naughty smile,

830
01:10:03,599 --> 01:10:11,165
Who are you to my sky?
An east or a dawn or a Sun?

831
01:10:11,607 --> 01:10:19,241
Who are you to my night?
A Moon or Moonlight or a Star?

832
01:11:07,863 --> 01:11:09,421
- Are you sleeping?
- No. -Come on.

833
01:11:10,266 --> 01:11:11,062
I am opening it.

834
01:11:11,200 --> 01:11:12,565
- What happened to the door?
- What happened?

835
01:11:13,135 --> 01:11:15,160
- You open it from outside.
- It isn't opening.

836
01:11:15,537 --> 01:11:17,232
Kick it.
No problem.

837
01:11:17,940 --> 01:11:19,032
- Shall I kick it?
- Kick it.

838
01:11:23,479 --> 01:11:26,312
Don't kick it in a hurry.
There is something wrong.

839
01:11:27,216 --> 01:11:28,649
Seems I am watching a replay.

840
01:11:52,241 --> 01:11:53,435
Bring coffee for me also.

841
01:11:55,577 --> 01:11:56,475
What is the news sir?

842
01:11:57,780 --> 01:11:58,610
It has been long time since I saw you.

843
01:11:58,714 --> 01:11:59,681
Tell me the matter.

844
01:12:00,115 --> 01:12:02,015
Last time you did as you wished.

845
01:12:02,184 --> 01:12:03,082
I didn't say a word against it.

846
01:12:03,786 --> 01:12:05,276
This time my word should win.

847
01:12:05,387 --> 01:12:06,615
You have to perform my marriage with Bagi.

848
01:12:06,989 --> 01:12:10,948
My situation is like I begot daughters
to supply you as girlfriends

849
01:12:11,794 --> 01:12:13,056
I am asking it without knowingly.

850
01:12:13,462 --> 01:12:16,431
Aren't you ashamed that you loved
her sister, but want to marr her?

851
01:12:16,532 --> 01:12:18,159
Not ashamed sir.
There is no information.

852
01:12:18,267 --> 01:12:19,825
If I had known
why would I do all these?

853
01:12:20,269 --> 01:12:21,293
Without the information..

854
01:12:21,670 --> 01:12:24,161
This wouldn't be happened
if she had come to her sister's marriage.

855
01:12:24,273 --> 01:12:26,764
- Then she was in America.
- That is it.

856
01:12:27,276 --> 01:12:29,107
You wanted to save 1 lakh rupees
by keeping her off that marriage.

857
01:12:29,211 --> 01:12:30,075
Now see!

858
01:12:31,213 --> 01:12:33,181
Listen to me and
allow me to marr Bagi.

859
01:12:33,349 --> 01:12:35,249
I'll stay in your house before you
like a parrot and a myna..

860
01:12:35,351 --> 01:12:39,412
You are not a Myna.
You belong to the vulture and owl race

861
01:12:39,621 --> 01:12:43,113
God! Give me patience not to harm him.

862
01:12:43,425 --> 01:12:45,188
How can God reduce your BP?

863
01:12:45,327 --> 01:12:48,524
- Consult a good doctor.
- I'll beg at your feet.

864
01:12:48,897 --> 01:12:50,023
You are an elder person.
Don't fall at my feet.

865
01:12:50,165 --> 01:12:52,929
- If you want you can greet me.
- I'll..

866
01:12:55,838 --> 01:12:56,862
What about the marriage matter?

867
01:12:57,239 --> 01:12:58,934
Look sir! I don't want one crore rupee
like your elder son-in-law..

868
01:12:59,041 --> 01:13:00,474
...arrange 60 or 70 lakh rupees for me..

869
01:13:00,576 --> 01:13:01,804
I'll give you for 5 minutes.

870
01:13:02,511 --> 01:13:06,345
If you still stay in this club
and in my daughter's life..

871
01:13:06,582 --> 01:13:07,412
If stayed...?

872
01:13:07,850 --> 01:13:10,410
I am telling you in
the witness of five directions..

873
01:13:14,056 --> 01:13:16,490
Hey stop there!
What are those five directions?

874
01:13:17,126 --> 01:13:20,027
I thought to challenge you
with that five directions..

875
01:13:20,129 --> 01:13:21,357
I thought that
it'll be a routine dialogue..

876
01:13:21,463 --> 01:13:24,296
Bye uncle.

877
01:13:29,605 --> 01:13:31,800
- What did my dad tell you?
- Greetings!

878
01:13:32,608 --> 01:13:34,838
I met Bagi's father today.

879
01:13:35,077 --> 01:13:37,511
And I told him our love affair.

880
01:13:37,613 --> 01:13:41,640
He also heard our total
love affair with patience

881
01:13:42,017 --> 01:13:44,099
I hope, he'll take a
good decision on this..

882
01:13:44,100 --> 01:13:46,181
We are waiting for his comment.

883
01:13:46,488 --> 01:13:48,422
I am taking leave
and 'Victor to India'.

884
01:13:49,091 --> 01:13:51,321
What did you say?
It means yes or no?

885
01:13:53,495 --> 01:13:55,929
How can a child like me
answer for this big question?

886
01:13:56,899 --> 01:13:59,993
Go and ask your dad!
See you.

887
01:14:02,171 --> 01:14:06,801
- The sheep has got trapped.
- Play Bulli Reddy.

888
01:14:16,251 --> 01:14:17,377
Come let's go to the canteen.

889
01:14:26,128 --> 01:14:27,026
Brother!

890
01:14:32,901 --> 01:14:33,731
Damn it!

891
01:14:34,736 --> 01:14:35,600
Come let's get the vehicle.

892
01:14:36,205 --> 01:14:37,297
Have you written your exams well?

893
01:14:37,406 --> 01:14:38,430
Don't toil hard.

894
01:14:38,941 --> 01:14:39,771
No problem however it is.

895
01:14:39,875 --> 01:14:41,274
I am not going to eat it.
It's him.

896
01:14:41,910 --> 01:14:45,311
- Do you only want best quality?
- Have it, it'll be good for your health.

897
01:14:48,150 --> 01:14:51,051
- Put it there.
- Have it.

898
01:14:53,755 --> 01:14:54,653
Is this a tea?

899
01:14:55,090 --> 01:14:56,921
If the tea isn't good,
order for another one.

900
01:14:57,092 --> 01:14:57,922
Why do you make fuss?

901
01:15:00,362 --> 01:15:01,989
- Who are you idiot?
- How dare you call me like that?

902
01:15:02,231 --> 01:15:03,129
You idiot!

903
01:15:03,966 --> 01:15:06,594
Don't hit him.
I am telling you.

904
01:15:06,768 --> 01:15:07,598
Hey Chotu! Bring a tea for him.

905
01:15:07,769 --> 01:15:09,464
You sit boss.
You come.

906
01:15:12,841 --> 01:15:14,399
If I shout loudly,
you'll urinate..

907
01:15:14,576 --> 01:15:19,513
- What urinate...!
- I'll hack you

908
01:15:19,715 --> 01:15:21,205
I'll take care of him.
Abi come.

909
01:15:21,383 --> 01:15:24,477
- Go with him.
- How dare he...?

910
01:15:24,920 --> 01:15:26,080
Don't act smart.

911
01:15:26,188 --> 01:15:28,679
- Go away. -Get on the bike.
- He is giving pose coming to our campus.

912
01:15:29,191 --> 01:15:30,021
Get on the bike.

913
01:15:31,793 --> 01:15:33,158
I'll kill you today..

914
01:15:37,266 --> 01:15:38,096
Leave him.

915
01:15:39,601 --> 01:15:41,068
Stop the vehicle.

916
01:15:46,742 --> 01:15:47,640
Stop the vehicle.

917
01:15:53,882 --> 01:15:59,115
His head will break like a watermelon.
Come man.

918
01:16:14,436 --> 01:16:15,733
Stop the vehicle.

919
01:16:22,978 --> 01:16:26,106
Come man.
Are you got tired?

920
01:16:39,461 --> 01:16:40,894
Stop the vehicle.

921
01:17:28,243 --> 01:17:29,835
Hey Dhoni! Hit it well!

922
01:18:39,314 --> 01:18:41,407
He is hitting rudely.
I won't be with you.

923
01:18:41,583 --> 01:18:44,211
Here is your advance.
I am leaving the place.

924
01:19:55,190 --> 01:19:57,658
Don't come forward.

925
01:19:59,227 --> 01:20:01,024
I'll kill him.

926
01:20:01,463 --> 01:20:02,430
I'll stab him if you come forward.

927
01:20:02,531 --> 01:20:03,657
- Don't come.
- Stab him.

928
01:20:03,799 --> 01:20:05,027
Don't be foolish.

929
01:20:05,667 --> 01:20:06,759
I'll stab him if you come forward.

930
01:20:07,068 --> 01:20:09,093
- I am telling you only.
- I am telling you, stab him.

931
01:20:09,538 --> 01:20:11,768
- Don't come forward.
- Stab him.

932
01:20:12,641 --> 01:20:15,371
- Don't come.
- Stab him.

933
01:20:15,610 --> 01:20:16,634
I'll stab him truly.

934
01:20:17,012 --> 01:20:19,446
- Whether you'll kill him or not,
I'll kill you. -Are you mad?

935
01:20:19,548 --> 01:20:22,176
You'll get satisfied that you
killed a person before your die.

936
01:20:48,176 --> 01:20:51,441
Come and lift him.
Careful.

937
01:20:54,983 --> 01:20:57,474
Leave him.
He'll die.

938
01:20:59,955 --> 01:21:01,718
- Listen to me, he'll die.
- Stop it.

939
01:21:03,458 --> 01:21:06,222
If he dies their people
will remember us and kill us.

940
01:21:06,461 --> 01:21:08,258
You won't care.
You don't have a permanent place.

941
01:21:08,530 --> 01:21:09,497
You can live anyhow.

942
01:21:10,065 --> 01:21:11,225
But we should live here.

943
01:21:11,800 --> 01:21:13,267
What do you know about our problems?

944
01:21:13,735 --> 01:21:15,293
- Problems?
- What do you know?

945
01:21:16,071 --> 01:21:17,936
Problems? What did you say?
Are they problems?

946
01:21:18,206 --> 01:21:19,696
You roam in imported bikes,
live in A/C rooms..

947
01:21:19,875 --> 01:21:23,402
...wear designer dress and
spend a thousand rupee for a day.

948
01:21:23,545 --> 01:21:25,103
You don't have the rights
to talk about the problems.

949
01:21:25,947 --> 01:21:29,439
I'll tell you about the real problems
in life, you listen it today.

950
01:21:31,086 --> 01:21:36,183
If I've to go to school daily,
I should walk up to 8 km. You know that?

951
01:21:37,158 --> 01:21:37,988
I know it.

952
01:21:38,360 --> 01:21:40,988
You know that they eat ragi food daily
and eat rice once for six months..

953
01:21:41,162 --> 01:21:43,392
Only for the festival
we cook rice

954
01:21:44,633 --> 01:21:45,463
I know it.

955
01:21:45,967 --> 01:21:47,935
Do you know the children
are dying without getting..

956
01:21:48,103 --> 01:21:49,730
...proper treatment at their young age?

957
01:21:51,239 --> 01:21:53,332
The people when they feel
thirsty they look at the sky..

958
01:21:53,441 --> 01:21:54,965
...and when they feel hungry
they look at the earth..

959
01:21:55,343 --> 01:21:56,742
There are also such people
who are living in the society.

960
01:21:56,845 --> 01:21:57,675
You know that?

961
01:21:58,980 --> 01:22:02,313
A mother died within 6 hours
after the father died.

962
01:22:02,484 --> 01:22:04,145
Have you ever experienced such a pain?

963
01:22:05,120 --> 01:22:06,018
I've experienced it.

964
01:22:06,721 --> 01:22:12,091
Have you ever felt some
strange force pressing you into the earth?

965
01:22:13,728 --> 01:22:16,026
Have you ever felt the pain of stretching
your shoulders when you were young?

966
01:22:16,464 --> 01:22:19,058
Have you ever experienced it?

967
01:22:19,367 --> 01:22:24,964
To live in this society our name,
occupation and strength isn't enough.

968
01:22:25,106 --> 01:22:28,075
Have you ever felt like
running way from the people?

969
01:22:30,412 --> 01:22:32,277
Has ever the forest appeared
to you as a mother?

970
01:22:32,681 --> 01:22:35,081
Have you ever felt only a gun
can make you feel secured?

971
01:22:35,216 --> 01:22:39,175
Have you ever felt that we can't live
without killing another one?

972
01:22:39,287 --> 01:22:40,185
I've experienced it.

973
01:22:40,488 --> 01:22:43,184
I held the gun and went into the forest.
I have become a naxalite

974
01:22:43,358 --> 01:22:45,986
I have become a naxalite

975
01:22:50,632 --> 01:22:55,262
I only have the right
to talk about the problem.

976
01:22:55,837 --> 01:22:58,931
You don't have it.
Definitely you don't have it.

977
01:23:05,947 --> 01:23:14,184
Move forward,

978
01:23:29,804 --> 01:23:31,101
I'll tell him.

979
01:23:31,606 --> 01:23:32,903
He is still in ICU.

980
01:23:35,944 --> 01:23:37,309
The doctor is examining.

981
01:23:37,412 --> 01:23:39,039
After knowing the matter..

982
01:23:40,081 --> 01:23:41,048
I'll call you.

983
01:23:42,684 --> 01:23:44,709
- How is he, sir?
- There is no major problem.

984
01:23:45,086 --> 01:23:46,986
It'll take 7 or 10 days to get recovered.

985
01:23:47,288 --> 01:23:48,778
You don't need to get tense.

986
01:23:53,094 --> 01:23:53,992
Out of danger buddy!

987
01:23:55,830 --> 01:23:58,264
Till then I know his height
and weight only.

988
01:23:58,500 --> 01:24:01,264
At first time I saw his deep that day.

989
01:24:03,104 --> 01:24:04,264
He was born in a peasant's family..

990
01:24:04,372 --> 01:24:07,205
...at Booma Reddy village
in Kareem Nagar district.

991
01:24:07,308 --> 01:24:09,276
His father name is Janardhan Sahu.

992
01:24:09,377 --> 01:24:11,140
His mother, Sumitra Sahu.

993
01:24:11,246 --> 01:24:13,476
His brother, Govind Sahu.

994
01:24:13,581 --> 01:24:16,141
According to WHO accounts,
his family was living..

995
01:24:16,251 --> 01:24:18,685
...4 km far for water..

996
01:24:18,787 --> 01:24:21,153
...8 km far for government hospital..

997
01:24:21,256 --> 01:24:23,417
...10 km far for the school..

998
01:24:23,525 --> 01:24:26,085
...and very close to misfortune.

999
01:24:26,528 --> 01:24:27,620
Brother!

1000
01:24:28,997 --> 01:24:32,433
What happened brother?

1001
01:24:35,804 --> 01:24:37,772
Nothing. There is a hole in the heart.

1002
01:24:38,606 --> 01:24:41,166
We have to take him to Hyderabad
and take some tests.

1003
01:24:42,010 --> 01:24:43,637
It's very expensive.

1004
01:24:43,945 --> 01:24:48,109
- Five is.. -No need of 5 lakh rupees.
One lakh rupee is enough.

1005
01:24:49,751 --> 01:24:52,117
There is no enough time.
That is the problem.

1006
01:24:54,289 --> 01:24:56,120
How many days are
there to make it?

1007
01:24:56,558 --> 01:24:58,719
Maximum, a month.
That's all.

1008
01:25:01,563 --> 01:25:02,723
What did he say?

1009
01:25:09,704 --> 01:25:11,535
He fell down because of weakness.

1010
01:25:13,908 --> 01:25:15,876
He said he'll be cured
if he takes this tonic.

1011
01:25:20,982 --> 01:25:22,882
The boy was very active.

1012
01:25:23,451 --> 01:25:26,545
That's why he died 10 days earlier
than the doctor said.

1013
01:25:34,662 --> 01:25:37,631
First time he saw the graveyard
when he was 8.

1014
01:25:37,732 --> 01:25:40,701
After that he didn't run for so long.

1015
01:25:44,005 --> 01:25:47,372
After some years,
Janardhan Sahu's crop had insects.

1016
01:25:47,475 --> 01:25:50,171
By pledging his farmland and house,
he bought chemicals and used it.

1017
01:25:50,812 --> 01:25:52,040
It didn't work out.

1018
01:25:52,213 --> 01:25:53,703
He got angry.

1019
01:25:53,948 --> 01:25:55,643
He himself drank that toxin.

1020
01:25:55,884 --> 01:25:56,851
It worked out.

1021
01:26:01,089 --> 01:26:02,056
Dad!

1022
01:26:05,026 --> 01:26:07,586
Dad!

1023
01:26:18,239 --> 01:26:19,797
Careful!

1024
01:26:26,714 --> 01:26:28,204
You stay with your mom.

1025
01:26:28,383 --> 01:26:30,214
You both didn't eat anything
since yesterday.

1026
01:26:30,652 --> 01:26:31,812
I'll go and get the tiff in.

1027
01:26:41,196 --> 01:26:42,823
Why are you sitting here?

1028
01:26:43,331 --> 01:26:44,491
Where is aunt?

1029
01:26:45,400 --> 01:26:47,960
Aunt!

1030
01:26:49,003 --> 01:26:50,903
We have to go to the graveyard again.

1031
01:27:03,351 --> 01:27:05,319
Have you got your leg hurt?

1032
01:27:07,021 --> 01:27:08,716
What happened?

1033
01:27:09,490 --> 01:27:11,458
- Damn stone!
- Go!

1034
01:27:14,429 --> 01:27:17,660
- Stop it!
- Go away.

1035
01:27:19,167 --> 01:27:20,657
Sanjay, Stop it.

1036
01:27:21,436 --> 01:27:23,666
Sanjay, Stop it.

1037
01:27:36,517 --> 01:27:38,007
Do you know whose stone is this?

1038
01:27:39,254 --> 01:27:41,279
It is the border stone
of the sir's farmland.

1039
01:27:41,656 --> 01:27:44,090
1000 acres of land which is
visible belonging to him.

1040
01:27:44,926 --> 01:27:47,895
How dare you touched his border stone?

1041
01:27:50,265 --> 01:27:51,823
Will you pluck that stone out?

1042
01:27:53,668 --> 01:27:55,761
Will you hit me?

1043
01:28:01,009 --> 01:28:02,772
How many people are there
in your sir's family?

1044
01:28:03,278 --> 01:28:06,111
How many people are there
in your sir's family?

1045
01:28:06,214 --> 01:28:09,115
- How many people are there
in your sir's family? -2 people.

1046
01:28:09,217 --> 01:28:10,514
Why do just 2 of them
need 1000 acres?

1047
01:28:10,618 --> 01:28:12,245
As per the rule how much
they should have?

1048
01:28:12,353 --> 01:28:13,911
Tell me how much they should have.

1049
01:28:14,088 --> 01:28:16,318
- Tell me. -Do you know
he is a king to this place?

1050
01:28:16,424 --> 01:28:20,724
Your sir may be the king of this place
but I am not his slave.

1051
01:28:20,828 --> 01:28:23,456
Is it the border line?
Is it your sir's land?

1052
01:28:23,564 --> 01:28:28,866
Is it a border stone?
Is it your sir's land?

1053
01:28:29,637 --> 01:28:32,197
Come here.
Doing rowdyism!

1054
01:28:32,373 --> 01:28:34,068
You'll bur the stones on the farmland.

1055
01:28:34,175 --> 01:28:37,804
You'll sell the drinking water.

1056
01:28:39,113 --> 01:28:41,274
You'll spoil the air
by building factories.

1057
01:28:41,382 --> 01:28:43,543
Don't humans inhale fresh air?

1058
01:28:44,319 --> 01:28:48,756
You will stock the
Kerosene oil and gas cylinders..

1059
01:28:48,856 --> 01:28:51,017
...sell them in the black market?

1060
01:28:51,125 --> 01:28:54,617
Come here.
Sit down.

1061
01:28:55,063 --> 01:28:59,898
What would we do
if you divide the sky also?

1062
01:29:00,001 --> 01:29:01,229
Don't we have to live in the earth?

1063
01:29:01,336 --> 01:29:03,304
Don't we have the right
to live here or not?

1064
01:29:04,539 --> 01:29:07,906
The earth, water, fire, air and
the sky belong to everyone.

1065
01:29:08,009 --> 01:29:10,170
It's not your dad's property
and your sir dad's property.

1066
01:29:10,278 --> 01:29:11,643
Understood?

1067
01:29:11,813 --> 01:29:13,110
Tell him as my word.

1068
01:29:13,214 --> 01:29:14,909
Your sir only don't
have 1000 acres of land.

1069
01:29:15,016 --> 01:29:16,711
Tell him as my word
to give his extra land.

1070
01:29:16,818 --> 01:29:18,979
- Tell him as my word.
Do you know my name? -No!

1071
01:29:19,087 --> 01:29:23,387
Tell him that Sanjay Sahu told it.

1072
01:29:30,164 --> 01:29:32,928
They will die.
Stop it.

1073
01:29:34,168 --> 01:29:34,998
Stop it.

1074
01:29:37,171 --> 01:29:38,138
Stop it.

1075
01:30:00,161 --> 01:30:05,155
The anger which you got is not only
on the stone which hurt you..

1076
01:30:05,500 --> 01:30:07,468
...or on the sir who buried that stone..

1077
01:30:07,568 --> 01:30:12,267
...or on the people who came to fight you..

1078
01:30:12,640 --> 01:30:14,471
Yet it depends in so many things..

1079
01:30:15,777 --> 01:30:19,269
...and the situations which
you are bearing for 25 years.

1080
01:30:20,381 --> 01:30:26,616
The people like you
have the same anger..

1081
01:30:26,721 --> 01:30:29,815
...are staying in that forest.

1082
01:30:30,858 --> 01:30:33,292
Will you work with them?

1083
01:30:34,862 --> 01:30:35,886
Will you come?

1084
01:30:37,064 --> 01:30:38,759
Has anybody buried the stones there also?

1085
01:30:38,866 --> 01:30:40,163
Come let's pluck it out.

1086
01:30:50,011 --> 01:30:54,311
Move forward,

1087
01:30:54,615 --> 01:30:56,446
Move forward,

1088
01:30:56,551 --> 01:30:58,178
The anger of a man..

1089
01:30:58,286 --> 01:31:00,516
Only then he found out
a person's anger as a group..

1090
01:31:00,621 --> 01:31:02,111
...would tend to perseverance.

1091
01:31:02,223 --> 01:31:04,384
He started his life as a courier boy,
became a cadre..

1092
01:31:04,492 --> 01:31:08,326
...and within a short time
he became the leader.

1093
01:31:12,900 --> 01:31:14,333
For whom is this gift?

1094
01:31:14,502 --> 01:31:16,402
Next week a minister
would go through the way.

1095
01:31:17,238 --> 01:31:19,001
How do you say that
his car alone would get blasted?

1096
01:31:19,106 --> 01:31:20,596
There will be a dozen convoy cars.

1097
01:31:20,708 --> 01:31:22,005
Other cars will also get blasted.

1098
01:31:22,376 --> 01:31:23,866
He will die if his car gets blasted.

1099
01:31:23,978 --> 01:31:25,605
He'll get scared
if his behind car gets blasted.

1100
01:31:25,713 --> 01:31:26,941
Anything is better?

1101
01:31:27,782 --> 01:31:30,273
It is wrong to kill innocent people
for his sake.

1102
01:31:31,719 --> 01:31:32,686
We are fighting a battle.

1103
01:31:32,787 --> 01:31:33,947
It can't have norms.

1104
01:31:34,055 --> 01:31:35,488
Only a victor or a defeat
will be the result.

1105
01:31:35,656 --> 01:31:38,352
If innocent people die in our fight
for innocent people,

1106
01:31:38,526 --> 01:31:40,426
What is the meaning of our fight?

1107
01:31:47,668 --> 01:31:48,760
This order has come from our seniors..

1108
01:31:48,936 --> 01:31:50,096
It's only important to me.

1109
01:31:50,204 --> 01:31:53,173
- Not your opinion.
- It's not an opinion. It's a truth.

1110
01:31:53,341 --> 01:31:56,105
He wanted
to tell that but he didn't.

1111
01:31:56,210 --> 01:32:00,647
When he was in the confusion
whether his fight was right or wrong..

1112
01:32:00,748 --> 01:32:01,715
One day..

1113
01:32:12,560 --> 01:32:13,993
Hey police are attacking.

1114
01:32:46,260 --> 01:32:47,557
Don't go forward.
You'll die.

1115
01:32:48,396 --> 01:32:51,627
- How many people are there?
- 5 or 6 people.

1116
01:32:54,802 --> 01:32:56,565
- Do you feel cold?
- No, sinus.

1117
01:32:57,939 --> 01:32:58,837
Why don't you use medicines?

1118
01:32:58,940 --> 01:33:00,237
- What?
- Don't you use the medicines?

1119
01:33:00,341 --> 01:33:01,706
It won't go until I die.

1120
01:33:01,809 --> 01:33:04,437
Then do one thing. Go ahead a little.
It'll happen.

1121
01:33:16,223 --> 01:33:17,713
Put your gun down.

1122
01:33:18,826 --> 01:33:20,259
You..

1123
01:33:43,718 --> 01:33:45,549
- Is it a scorpion?
- No, it's an ant.

1124
01:33:46,053 --> 01:33:48,487
- Are scaring of an ant..
- Why are you laughing?

1125
01:33:48,589 --> 01:33:51,490
- Nothing. -You think that
it'll be good if I die, isn't it?

1126
01:33:53,594 --> 01:33:56,358
You tied my hands.
How could I?

1127
01:33:57,932 --> 01:33:59,695
Do you know all this happened
because of you only?

1128
01:34:00,267 --> 01:34:02,030
Encounters and combings..

1129
01:34:03,004 --> 01:34:04,904
I was very happy in Hyderabad.

1130
01:34:05,072 --> 01:34:07,563
I am roaming in this forest without
having proper food since 2 years.

1131
01:34:08,743 --> 01:34:12,110
Will you blast government offices,
buses and everything?

1132
01:34:12,213 --> 01:34:14,044
Are you thinking they are Diwali things?

1133
01:34:14,815 --> 01:34:16,715
Not too far with my department..

1134
01:34:17,151 --> 01:34:19,517
...you can't remove
at least my shirt button.

1135
01:34:20,354 --> 01:34:22,584
- Are all mistakes ours?
Don't you have? -It's all yours

1136
01:34:22,690 --> 01:34:24,248
I am telling it
because you are doing it.

1137
01:34:25,226 --> 01:34:26,921
- Nothing.
- What nothing?

1138
01:34:27,028 --> 01:34:29,929
- The mistake is not ours.
- Accept all the mistake is yours.

1139
01:34:30,031 --> 01:34:31,123
- I won't accept.
- Accept it.

1140
01:34:31,232 --> 01:34:32,722
- The mistake is not ours.
- Accept it.

1141
01:34:32,833 --> 01:34:35,802
- Why should I accept it?
- Because I have the gun, accept it.

1142
01:34:35,903 --> 01:34:38,394
Ok, the mistake is ours.

1143
01:34:38,506 --> 01:34:39,871
Remove it. It'll get fired.

1144
01:34:39,974 --> 01:34:41,601
Didn't I accept that the mistake
is ours. Remove it.

1145
01:34:48,983 --> 01:34:50,143
I'll make all of them..

1146
01:34:52,787 --> 01:34:55,813
- What is this?
- It's a mire.

1147
01:34:55,923 --> 01:34:58,551
- Did you arrange it?
- I haven't much technology.

1148
01:34:58,659 --> 01:35:01,025
Save me
or else I'll kill you.

1149
01:35:01,128 --> 01:35:03,289
Save me
or else I'll kill you.

1150
01:35:03,397 --> 01:35:04,364
- A small correction.
- What?

1151
01:35:04,465 --> 01:35:06,228
Say that pull me out
or else I'll die.

1152
01:35:06,333 --> 01:35:08,301
Why do you use the grammar at this time?

1153
01:35:08,402 --> 01:35:09,892
Save me.

1154
01:35:10,004 --> 01:35:11,972
- Wait a minute.
- Come.

1155
01:35:15,743 --> 01:35:16,641
- Come!
- Give me that gun.

1156
01:35:16,744 --> 01:35:17,836
- I am coming.
- Hold it.

1157
01:35:17,945 --> 01:35:19,105
- Give me that gun.
- Pull me!

1158
01:35:20,281 --> 01:35:22,579
- Pull me.
- Be careful.

1159
01:35:33,227 --> 01:35:36,663
What dear?
What did you say just now?

1160
01:35:36,831 --> 01:35:38,059
Are we doing the troubles?

1161
01:35:38,432 --> 01:35:41,128
What you are doing?
Social service?

1162
01:35:42,503 --> 01:35:45,404
Why do the people like us fight
if you don't make the mistakes?

1163
01:35:45,506 --> 01:35:46,530
The mistake is yours.

1164
01:35:46,640 --> 01:35:49,336
If the mistake had ours,
I would have killed you then.

1165
01:35:49,777 --> 01:35:52,143
Don't argue madly.
Accept the mistake is yours.

1166
01:35:52,246 --> 01:35:55,215
- Why should I accept it?
- Because I have the gun.

1167
01:35:55,316 --> 01:35:57,079
Accept that the mistake is yours.

1168
01:35:58,586 --> 01:36:00,213
- Ok!
- What ok?

1169
01:36:00,454 --> 01:36:02,422
The mistake is ours.

1170
01:36:02,523 --> 01:36:04,081
It's not hearing,
tell correctly.

1171
01:36:04,191 --> 01:36:06,091
The mistake is ours, ok?

1172
01:36:08,662 --> 01:36:11,028
You put it in your neck.
Just now you made me to carr. Get up!

1173
01:36:12,867 --> 01:36:13,663
Get up!

1174
01:36:31,752 --> 01:36:40,785
Hey move forward,

1175
01:36:40,961 --> 01:36:45,523
You should know the journey of yours,

1176
01:36:45,633 --> 01:36:50,127
First, decide with whom to fight,

1177
01:36:54,441 --> 01:36:59,003
You can't live without killing
and kill for your livelihood,

1178
01:36:59,113 --> 01:37:04,016
when you learn it from the forest,
what's the use seeking a good path?

1179
01:37:08,322 --> 01:37:12,952
Killing is a nature and
challenging is a dream,

1180
01:37:13,060 --> 01:37:17,759
will the intelligence
know itself is a enemy?

1181
01:37:22,403 --> 01:37:26,965
Mother's lap is same for brave
and pitiable people,

1182
01:37:27,074 --> 01:37:31,704
The tears are same
for courageous and cowardice.

1183
01:37:36,016 --> 01:37:40,510
Then we was uncivilized
and now we are civilized,

1184
01:37:40,621 --> 01:37:45,456
but we didn't achieve
a growth than animals.

1185
01:37:49,830 --> 01:37:54,324
Becoming like Lord Ram
we can fight demons,

1186
01:37:54,435 --> 01:37:59,395
but we already forgot our own faces
by covering all the disguise.

1187
01:38:10,451 --> 01:38:13,750
By starting a journey
as a naxalite and police..

1188
01:38:13,854 --> 01:38:17,346
...became like two people after 8 hours.

1189
01:38:19,927 --> 01:38:21,554
NARASAPUR

1190
01:38:21,662 --> 01:38:23,027
Seems some vehicle is coming.

1191
01:38:25,799 --> 01:38:27,494
It would be a police jeep.

1192
01:38:28,002 --> 01:38:29,435
Give me the gun.

1193
01:38:29,737 --> 01:38:31,170
I won't tell them
that you are a naxalite here.

1194
01:38:31,272 --> 01:38:34,036
I'll go to the police station, call
the press and make to live in the society.

1195
01:38:34,408 --> 01:38:35,705
May be Naxalites are coming..

1196
01:38:35,809 --> 01:38:37,299
I'll keep the gun with me.

1197
01:38:37,478 --> 01:38:38,706
You go and hide in that bush.

1198
01:38:38,812 --> 01:38:40,973
After I go, you go to
the nearby police station here.

1199
01:38:42,616 --> 01:38:44,174
What if it would be a public bus..

1200
01:38:45,753 --> 01:38:46,981
Let's throw the gun into the bush..

1201
01:38:47,087 --> 01:38:49,180
Let's board the bus, get down in village
and will go in their respective ways.

1202
01:38:59,033 --> 01:39:00,193
What is it?
Why many cars are coming?

1203
01:39:00,301 --> 01:39:01,529
It's home minister's car.

1204
01:39:07,041 --> 01:39:09,669
- What? -Don't go there.
There is a land mine.

1205
01:39:11,979 --> 01:39:13,537
How do you know
that there is a land mine?

1206
01:39:13,647 --> 01:39:15,274
I was one of the members
in the team that buried it.

1207
01:39:16,250 --> 01:39:19,344
- How much is its capacity?
- Half the cars would be blasted.

1208
01:39:19,787 --> 01:39:21,277
How? They are coming.

1209
01:39:21,455 --> 01:39:24,151
- Stop it. -How should
I stop it? -Shout loudly.

1210
01:39:24,258 --> 01:39:25,486
They can't hear
if I shout loudly.

1211
01:39:25,592 --> 01:39:27,219
Remove your shirt and wave.
Stop it.

1212
01:39:27,328 --> 01:39:29,558
Give me your shirt.

1213
01:39:29,663 --> 01:39:30,891
- Give me.
- I won't give you. -Why?

1214
01:39:31,999 --> 01:39:34,024
Why? If they ask
whose shirt saved the car..

1215
01:39:34,134 --> 01:39:35,965
...If you tell it's mine,
who will get that credit, you or I?

1216
01:39:36,070 --> 01:39:37,264
You should get that credit.

1217
01:39:38,872 --> 01:39:40,840
- Oh gosh!
- Be careful.

1218
01:39:59,293 --> 01:40:02,592
There is a land mine.
Stop it.

1219
01:40:04,231 --> 01:40:07,064
Where is the minister?
Be careful, the land mine is there.

1220
01:40:13,374 --> 01:40:14,671
You saved my life.

1221
01:40:17,711 --> 01:40:19,542
It's I who waved the shirt.

1222
01:40:19,646 --> 01:40:22,080
You waved it for a lift.

1223
01:40:22,182 --> 01:40:24,207
Look at that guy!
He waved red cloth.

1224
01:40:24,318 --> 01:40:25,683
It's the stopping signal.

1225
01:40:25,786 --> 01:40:28,084
Why do you expose?
Wear the shirt.

1226
01:40:28,322 --> 01:40:31,018
- Who is he? -He asked you
for a Hyderabad transfer

1227
01:40:34,728 --> 01:40:36,355
I am coming.
I am on the way.

1228
01:40:36,463 --> 01:40:40,422
Keeping red cloth with you,
why did you make me remove my shirt?

1229
01:40:41,869 --> 01:40:43,962
Forget the department..

1230
01:40:44,071 --> 01:40:46,562
...you can't remove even
my shirt buttons.

1231
01:40:47,741 --> 01:40:51,177
- I said it generally.
- But I took it seriously.

1232
01:40:51,612 --> 01:40:52,909
Hey..

1233
01:40:53,013 --> 01:40:56,176
I'll kill you.

1234
01:41:13,634 --> 01:41:15,602
I tested it whether it'll
get blasted or not..

1235
01:41:17,971 --> 01:41:20,269
- Is it you who asked for a
Hyderabad transfer? -Yes sir!

1236
01:41:20,374 --> 01:41:22,274
I'll be in this posting for 3 years.

1237
01:41:22,376 --> 01:41:26,278
You can see not only the road but
at least a deserted area in this 3 years

1238
01:41:26,380 --> 01:41:28,473
I am dedicating you to this forest.

1239
01:41:36,256 --> 01:41:40,488
3 years in Chitha Palli forest..

1240
01:41:42,129 --> 01:41:43,221
What is it?

1241
01:41:43,464 --> 01:41:45,432
I said it in barbaric language
that I was roaming.

1242
01:41:47,734 --> 01:41:51,966
He got society life
and I got exile.

1243
01:41:55,876 --> 01:41:57,173
POLICE STATION
KOTHULA VALASA.

1244
01:41:57,277 --> 01:41:58,904
He was dancing in Hyderabad disco.

1245
01:42:03,617 --> 01:42:05,244
I was dancing in Kothula Valasa.

1246
01:42:10,090 --> 01:42:11,990
He was eating burgers and pizzas..

1247
01:42:15,295 --> 01:42:16,990
I was eating roots and vegetables.

1248
01:42:24,638 --> 01:42:26,663
I said it in barbaric language
that he showed me the hell.

1249
01:42:26,773 --> 01:42:27,865
Don't ask that.
I am used to it.

1250
01:42:27,975 --> 01:42:30,205
If I had been there for some days,
I would've forgotten Telugu.

1251
01:42:30,310 --> 01:42:32,870
He may not be a great person..

1252
01:42:33,180 --> 01:42:34,010
But he is a good person.

1253
01:42:34,114 --> 01:42:35,877
What good?

1254
01:42:41,455 --> 01:42:43,821
He came to marr your sister
one and half year ago.

1255
01:42:43,924 --> 01:42:45,084
Now he says that he is loving with you.

1256
01:42:45,192 --> 01:42:46,682
Are you supporting him?

1257
01:42:58,872 --> 01:43:00,169
What about me?

1258
01:43:00,274 --> 01:43:01,764
Use sister's books.

1259
01:43:04,811 --> 01:43:06,574
A new bike for you to go to the college.

1260
01:43:08,415 --> 01:43:10,849
- What about me?
- Use sister's cycle.

1261
01:43:18,959 --> 01:43:21,189
- You got a good husband.
- Then what about me?

1262
01:43:22,563 --> 01:43:24,929
Here is your sister's boyfriend.

1263
01:43:36,977 --> 01:43:38,672
I'll listen to you dad.

1264
01:43:42,049 --> 01:43:43,346
I know it Bagi.

1265
01:43:45,252 --> 01:43:46,947
I'll also come with you.

1266
01:43:47,588 --> 01:43:48,612
Why should you?

1267
01:43:48,855 --> 01:43:50,618
Why should you run way
for no mistake of yours?

1268
01:43:50,791 --> 01:43:52,759
Your exams will be
completed in 2 months. Then come.

1269
01:43:52,859 --> 01:43:53,951
No dad, if I stay here,
he will..

1270
01:43:54,061 --> 01:43:56,222
He can't harm you.

1271
01:43:56,663 --> 01:44:00,963
I selected a sharp guy for your security.

1272
01:44:20,020 --> 01:44:21,851
- You have remembered
what I told, isn't it? -Yes sir.

1273
01:44:21,955 --> 01:44:23,923
If he acts over smart..

1274
01:44:24,024 --> 01:44:25,855
Is there any problem
to you if I kill him?

1275
01:44:36,503 --> 01:44:37,527
Not that Sami!

1276
01:44:37,638 --> 01:44:39,003
They are city guys.

1277
01:44:39,506 --> 01:44:41,269
They tried for some plans..

1278
01:44:41,908 --> 01:44:44,741
He didn't know that.
He hit them black and blue.

1279
01:44:44,978 --> 01:44:46,673
If it would be our guys..

1280
01:44:47,247 --> 01:44:50,341
...they will make a plan
after killing him.

1281
01:44:50,450 --> 01:44:52,680
How to vanish the corpse?

1282
01:44:55,455 --> 01:44:56,547
Shall I call them?

1283
01:44:57,924 --> 01:45:01,485
If wants to switch off the light,
no need to blast the transformer.

1284
01:45:02,062 --> 01:45:04,292
It's enough to make switch off

1285
01:45:05,599 --> 01:45:09,433
I am thinking where his switch is.

1286
01:45:29,289 --> 01:45:31,849
You made your father to accept.

1287
01:45:32,959 --> 01:45:33,857
You are not an ordinary person.

1288
01:45:33,960 --> 01:45:35,655
If you get 10 days time,
you'll convince Pakistan..

1289
01:45:35,762 --> 01:45:37,127
...and make them tell
that they don't want Kashmir.

1290
01:45:39,766 --> 01:45:40,926
What happened Bagi?

1291
01:45:42,969 --> 01:45:44,459
I hate liars.

1292
01:45:44,571 --> 01:45:47,540
Have you gone mad? When did I
lie to you? I can't get it. Tell me.

1293
01:45:47,641 --> 01:45:49,131
See how he is asking..

1294
01:45:49,242 --> 01:45:50,869
Like Kamalhasan in Swathimuthiam movie..

1295
01:45:50,977 --> 01:45:52,877
Why didn't you tell me
that you were a Naxalite?

1296
01:45:53,046 --> 01:45:55,139
Was I a Naxalite?

1297
01:45:55,248 --> 01:45:56,875
It's a small matter.

1298
01:45:57,117 --> 01:45:59,483
If you laugh,
I'll slap you.

1299
01:46:00,120 --> 01:46:01,883
Why didn't you tell me
that you were a Naxalite?

1300
01:46:02,189 --> 01:46:03,884
Did you tell me
that your father was a SP?

1301
01:46:03,990 --> 01:46:06,015
Did you tell me
that your father was a SP?

1302
01:46:06,126 --> 01:46:08,617
- You didn't tell me.
- I hate you.

1303
01:46:08,795 --> 01:46:11,286
I don't care even if you were
a Naxalite or Veerappan..

1304
01:46:11,398 --> 01:46:13,832
Should I settle with
secondhand things all my life?

1305
01:46:13,934 --> 01:46:16,767
Like books, cycle
and at last love also.

1306
01:46:16,937 --> 01:46:18,564
Am I a secondhand taker?

1307
01:46:18,672 --> 01:46:20,572
You didn't tell me that
you had an affair with my sister..

1308
01:46:20,674 --> 01:46:22,369
...when you were coming out from my dad.

1309
01:46:22,476 --> 01:46:24,774
Leave me. You didn't tell me
that you had a sister.

1310
01:46:24,878 --> 01:46:25,776
You didn't.

1311
01:46:27,814 --> 01:46:29,042
GO AWAY.

1312
01:46:29,149 --> 01:46:30,173
What did you tell?

1313
01:46:30,283 --> 01:46:31,443
Did you tell anything about your family?

1314
01:46:31,551 --> 01:46:35,317
You didn't tell me about
your mother, father and everyone

1315
01:46:35,555 --> 01:46:37,716
I hid 2 things from you.
It's a simple matter..

1316
01:46:37,824 --> 01:46:39,917
...that I was a Naxalite
and I loved your sister.

1317
01:46:40,026 --> 01:46:41,186
Did I love her after knowing
she was your sister?

1318
01:46:41,294 --> 01:46:43,387
I didn't. But it happened.
Did we plan it before?

1319
01:46:43,497 --> 01:46:46,660
Did I know that I'll
fall in love with both of you?

1320
01:46:46,767 --> 01:46:48,200
I didn't know anything.
It happened like that.

1321
01:46:48,301 --> 01:46:49,598
Why do you make fuss for this?

1322
01:46:49,703 --> 01:46:52,536
What do I know
except your brandy and whisky?

1323
01:46:52,706 --> 01:46:53,730
I would have told you
if you had asked it.

1324
01:46:53,840 --> 01:46:55,933
I don't have to ask and find out.

1325
01:46:56,109 --> 01:46:58,134
I too don't have the habit
to tell it without getting asked.

1326
01:47:01,181 --> 01:47:04,480
Shall I give you autobiography
ever since I was born? Is it enough?

1327
01:47:04,785 --> 01:47:07,151
No need! It's not manners to know
about strangers details.

1328
01:47:07,254 --> 01:47:08,414
Am I a stranger?

1329
01:47:08,522 --> 01:47:09,546
Am I a stranger?

1330
01:47:13,393 --> 01:47:14,417
Oh god!

1331
01:47:18,999 --> 01:47:22,435
Let's put our relationship into
the cupboard and live our own freshly.

1332
01:47:23,003 --> 01:47:26,632
- Bagi! You are.. -Not like this emotional,
let's behave like matured guys

1333
01:47:31,745 --> 01:47:32,769
I have a sister..

1334
01:47:33,079 --> 01:47:35,445
...and have a puppy since 1 year.

1335
01:47:35,549 --> 01:47:36,516
What about you?

1336
01:47:41,221 --> 01:47:44,190
- What you do?
- I'll keep off mad guys.

1337
01:47:52,566 --> 01:47:54,534
Damn fresh!

1338
01:47:55,635 --> 01:47:57,193
Who are you?
Are you a watchman?

1339
01:47:57,304 --> 01:47:58,464
Who I am.

1340
01:48:00,240 --> 01:48:02,140
- Moreover who are you?
- Who am I?

1341
01:48:02,242 --> 01:48:04,870
Telling her and you who I am..
I'll tell.

1342
01:48:04,978 --> 01:48:07,208
My name is Sanjay Sahu.

1343
01:48:07,380 --> 01:48:08,938
I am doing MA Economics
in Osmania university..

1344
01:48:09,049 --> 01:48:10,414
...I'll make aerobics with guys..

1345
01:48:10,517 --> 01:48:12,815
...and go with girls to watch
movies in Multiplexes.

1346
01:48:13,987 --> 01:48:15,011
Turn your head.

1347
01:48:15,322 --> 01:48:16,949
Never ask me who I am.

1348
01:48:29,703 --> 01:48:35,903
You are for yours and we are for ours,

1349
01:48:40,146 --> 01:48:41,511
Let's hold it.

1350
01:48:45,552 --> 01:48:49,044
- Those also.
- These too!

1351
01:48:52,359 --> 01:48:53,917
- Do you have a bowl?
- No.

1352
01:48:54,561 --> 01:48:55,994
- Then stretch your hands?
- Why?

1353
01:48:56,162 --> 01:48:57,390
Do you want the answer or milk?

1354
01:48:57,497 --> 01:48:59,522
- I want milk only.
- Stretch your hands.

1355
01:48:59,966 --> 01:49:01,524
- Stretch your hands, sir.
- Hands.

1356
01:49:08,975 --> 01:49:10,875
Half milk for you and
half milk for me..

1357
01:49:11,177 --> 01:49:12,201
When there was 2 pockets..

1358
01:49:12,312 --> 01:49:14,678
...you might took one pocket and
you would give me another pocket.

1359
01:49:14,848 --> 01:49:16,941
Oh god! I didn't get the idea.

1360
01:49:20,186 --> 01:49:21,744
How can you think these ideas?

1361
01:49:21,855 --> 01:49:23,482
Have you heard what he told?

1362
01:49:23,590 --> 01:49:25,080
Amn't I an unlucky guy
that's why I can think.

1363
01:49:29,062 --> 01:49:31,553
- What is it?
- Sleeping tablets.

1364
01:49:31,665 --> 01:49:34,293
- Why? -When we mix it in
Bagi's drinking milk tonight..

1365
01:49:34,401 --> 01:49:36,164
...she'll drink and go to a deep sleep.

1366
01:49:36,403 --> 01:49:38,428
She won't bother
if we celebrate a festival..

1367
01:49:38,738 --> 01:49:40,035
...and she won't resist even if I rape her.

1368
01:49:40,140 --> 01:49:42,438
You sinners! What an atrocity?

1369
01:49:42,542 --> 01:49:44,840
- Pranav sir!
- The glass may break.

1370
01:49:44,945 --> 01:49:48,574
- That is..
- Is there no glass?

1371
01:49:48,682 --> 01:49:49,512
I thought it would be there.

1372
01:49:49,616 --> 01:49:52,642
- Pranav sir!
- You dare to steal ladies chastity..

1373
01:49:52,752 --> 01:49:53,844
It's not so difficult
for you to remove the glass.

1374
01:49:53,954 --> 01:49:55,319
- No sir.
- You idiots!

1375
01:49:55,422 --> 01:49:57,583
It's just for fun, sir.

1376
01:49:58,425 --> 01:49:59,392
Just listen to me sir.

1377
01:49:59,492 --> 01:50:00,322
Don't tell this to Bagi.

1378
01:50:00,427 --> 01:50:02,452
How dare you point your finger at me?

1379
01:50:02,562 --> 01:50:03,722
I'll cut your hand.

1380
01:50:03,830 --> 01:50:04,660
What do you think of me?

1381
01:50:08,501 --> 01:50:10,332
- Shut up.
- Don't spoil my life.

1382
01:50:10,437 --> 01:50:12,462
- What do you think of me?
- Don't spoil my life.

1383
01:50:13,440 --> 01:50:16,603
- Don't dare to me.
- What happened?

1384
01:50:17,177 --> 01:50:19,737
- What happened to your cheek?
- I scratched the wall.

1385
01:50:19,913 --> 01:50:22,143
How could you scratch on your left side
when the wall is on right side?

1386
01:50:22,248 --> 01:50:24,148
I scratched the wall when
I was getting down.

1387
01:50:24,718 --> 01:50:26,151
Why did your eye turn into red?

1388
01:50:26,252 --> 01:50:27,719
Why do you ask
all the questions now?

1389
01:50:27,821 --> 01:50:29,618
...like a class teacher.

1390
01:50:31,992 --> 01:50:35,359
- Where are you going again?
- I'll get mad if I stay here

1391
01:50:35,462 --> 01:50:37,020
I'll go outside, roam and come back.

1392
01:50:40,200 --> 01:50:43,636
No, why do I go?
I don't go.

1393
01:50:43,870 --> 01:50:45,303
You said that you'll go outside.

1394
01:50:45,605 --> 01:50:47,038
If I said that I'll go,
should I?

1395
01:50:47,140 --> 01:50:49,233
I don't go.
I'll stay in the house.

1396
01:51:04,758 --> 01:51:06,055
What is it Pranav?

1397
01:51:06,760 --> 01:51:08,785
How it is if you talk
disappointing words?

1398
01:51:09,295 --> 01:51:12,662
Do you know what will happen
if you disappoint me?

1399
01:51:12,966 --> 01:51:15,799
After seeing it you should
take a decision yourself.

1400
01:51:31,851 --> 01:51:33,751
God is there for everything.

1401
01:51:41,795 --> 01:51:42,887
Did you give her?

1402
01:51:43,930 --> 01:51:44,828
Did she drink?

1403
01:51:46,266 --> 01:51:48,700
Why are you lying?

1404
01:51:49,002 --> 01:51:51,903
Seeing milk on your moustache I can say
that you have drunken the milk.

1405
01:51:52,005 --> 01:51:54,098
A little got remained in the last..

1406
01:51:54,808 --> 01:51:57,242
My idea is you should drink the milk..

1407
01:51:57,477 --> 01:51:59,445
What joy will be there raping a girl
while she is in sleep?

1408
01:51:59,546 --> 01:52:01,241
...should do it with running girl..

1409
01:52:01,681 --> 01:52:04,445
Now you should go to bed and she'll run.

1410
01:52:04,951 --> 01:52:06,714
She'll shout and cr..

1411
01:52:08,555 --> 01:52:10,318
Save my chastity.

1412
01:52:11,091 --> 01:52:12,388
Then I..

1413
01:52:15,428 --> 01:52:18,795
It is the days of Sanjay Sahu
to tr to forget Bagumathi.

1414
01:52:19,032 --> 01:52:23,662
Similarly it is the days of Damodhar Reddy
not to tr to forget Sanjay Sahu.

1415
01:52:25,638 --> 01:52:27,799
It is the bus stop you're
looking for last 15 minutes.

1416
01:52:28,441 --> 01:52:30,466
Go and enjoy.

1417
01:52:30,643 --> 01:52:32,873
Can I reach Jubilee Hills
if get into 16B bus?

1418
01:52:35,181 --> 01:52:38,673
Look brother! It's in
our hands to get into 16B..

1419
01:52:38,785 --> 01:52:41,413
...will it reach Jubilee hills or reach
Apollo hospitals by an accident..

1420
01:52:41,521 --> 01:52:43,079
...Is in driver's hands.

1421
01:52:50,597 --> 01:52:52,360
Don't worry too much.
Take it lightly.

1422
01:52:53,399 --> 01:52:54,297
Who is it?

1423
01:52:55,068 --> 01:52:56,831
What is that bag?

1424
01:52:56,936 --> 01:53:00,303
Adhi, come here! Are you seeing
a guy walking with pyjama?

1425
01:53:00,406 --> 01:53:03,375
- Go and give the bag to him.
- Seems he forgot it. -Ok sir.

1426
01:53:07,280 --> 01:53:09,441
It's you.

1427
01:54:30,763 --> 01:54:32,458
It'll take a week to bur the pit.

1428
01:54:33,166 --> 01:54:34,997
Will need 10 days to build the bunk..

1429
01:54:35,902 --> 01:54:37,870
Will need a month
to this child to get cured.

1430
01:54:38,571 --> 01:54:41,005
Don't know how many years
will he take to laugh like past?

1431
01:54:47,580 --> 01:54:50,947
Stop. She is studying inside.

1432
01:54:51,251 --> 01:54:52,479
Is she studying?

1433
01:54:53,119 --> 01:54:55,952
She may study it later.
You go.

1434
01:54:56,723 --> 01:54:57,883
Go.

1435
01:54:59,459 --> 01:55:01,017
Why do you bother?

1436
01:55:06,399 --> 01:55:07,559
Have you got scared?

1437
01:55:08,334 --> 01:55:10,894
Nothing Bagi.
I want to tell you something.

1438
01:55:11,004 --> 01:55:12,596
- What?
- About Jo!

1439
01:55:13,573 --> 01:55:16,098
I am feeling shy.

1440
01:55:16,542 --> 01:55:17,634
She looks very sexy, isn't it?

1441
01:55:17,744 --> 01:55:19,905
- Will you give me her number?
- For what?

1442
01:55:20,546 --> 01:55:22,912
The people who are matured
don't ask like this questions.

1443
01:55:32,558 --> 01:55:33,388
You helped me a good one.

1444
01:55:33,493 --> 01:55:37,259
In your Economics, a guy always
wear a check shirt, looks tall and fair.

1445
01:55:37,363 --> 01:55:39,923
- He is Sekhar and I know him.
- He looks handsome.

1446
01:55:40,033 --> 01:55:41,933
- Do you have his number?
- I have.

1447
01:55:42,035 --> 01:55:44,595
- Will you give me once?
- I won't. -Why?

1448
01:55:44,704 --> 01:55:46,001
I am not matured like you.

1449
01:55:58,117 --> 01:55:59,243
What a speed!

1450
01:55:59,585 --> 01:56:01,553
When he called her,
she has come at once.

1451
01:56:11,331 --> 01:56:14,232
I want full details of
what they are talking and doing.

1452
01:56:18,137 --> 01:56:19,832
That day I talked in inebriation..

1453
01:56:20,707 --> 01:56:22,174
He may notice me if I stay here.

1454
01:56:29,849 --> 01:56:31,714
I am busy.
I'll call you.

1455
01:56:31,851 --> 01:56:32,875
I'll talk you.

1456
01:56:33,119 --> 01:56:35,246
- Sami have this fruit!
- Wait.

1457
01:56:35,688 --> 01:56:36,552
Dear!

1458
01:56:37,991 --> 01:56:39,720
Don't be in a hurry!
Wash it and eat.

1459
01:56:40,426 --> 01:56:42,724
Sami! I want money.

1460
01:56:42,996 --> 01:56:45,726
Ask like peace and delight
But don't ask money.

1461
01:56:45,832 --> 01:56:48,392
I don't want that.
I want 5 thousand rupees urgently.

1462
01:56:48,501 --> 01:56:50,298
- It's a waste expense.
- You..

1463
01:56:50,403 --> 01:56:52,132
Sami! Don't use abuse words.

1464
01:56:52,939 --> 01:56:53,906
There is a cupboard in the corner.

1465
01:56:54,007 --> 01:56:55,702
A shirt with 5,000 rupees are inside it.

1466
01:56:55,808 --> 01:56:56,604
Take it and go.

1467
01:56:59,479 --> 01:57:01,572
Is it that shirt?
Where is the money?

1468
01:57:07,253 --> 01:57:08,049
He pulled it.

1469
01:57:11,624 --> 01:57:12,784
I want a shirt.

1470
01:57:12,959 --> 01:57:14,426
- Full hands or half hands?
- Half hands.

1471
01:57:14,694 --> 01:57:16,389
It is in the cup board.
Take it and go.

1472
01:57:18,898 --> 01:57:19,922
I've to change the shirt.

1473
01:57:21,601 --> 01:57:23,432
It's fine that he didn't ask for a brief.

1474
01:57:25,271 --> 01:57:26,101
He pulled the door.

1475
01:57:27,306 --> 01:57:29,297
I gave you a ring.
Where is it?

1476
01:57:29,642 --> 01:57:31,007
It is in the cupboard.
Take it and go.

1477
01:57:32,445 --> 01:57:33,969
Has he eyed this ring too?

1478
01:57:34,881 --> 01:57:35,779
There is no use.

1479
01:57:36,983 --> 01:57:37,813
You wait.

1480
01:57:38,017 --> 01:57:39,075
What is there in the cupboard?

1481
01:57:39,218 --> 01:57:40,617
You are sending them
to the cupboard for everything.

1482
01:57:40,820 --> 01:57:43,584
There is a dirty shirt
and a hole for that.

1483
01:57:43,823 --> 01:57:46,121
They took my shirt and money.

1484
01:57:46,292 --> 01:57:48,852
Is this a celestial bowl
to get rings and diamonds?

1485
01:57:48,995 --> 01:57:51,725
- Damn it. -Who is he?
He is using abuse words.

1486
01:57:51,831 --> 01:57:53,321
Jo, you don't bother about it.
He is an insane.

1487
01:57:53,466 --> 01:57:54,797
- Is it me?
- You are only..

1488
01:57:54,901 --> 01:57:55,993
- Insane?
- Yes.

1489
01:57:56,169 --> 01:57:57,466
You are crazy for women.

1490
01:57:57,603 --> 01:57:59,594
- He spoiled my mood.
- You go madam.

1491
01:58:00,039 --> 01:58:02,735
- I'll kill you.
- That devil would have sent him here.

1492
01:58:02,842 --> 01:58:04,434
She is an angel but not a devil.

1493
01:58:04,544 --> 01:58:05,977
- She sent me to save you.
- Don't trust him.

1494
01:58:06,079 --> 01:58:08,946
- Come to the party in the evening.
- Jo, I'll be there in time.

1495
01:58:09,048 --> 01:58:11,346
You go.
Put the gear..

1496
01:58:11,451 --> 01:58:13,646
- He is a demon who wore a t-shirt.
- Go madam.

1497
01:58:15,588 --> 01:58:17,681
What Pranav?
Is anything looking differently?

1498
01:58:17,790 --> 01:58:22,420
- Nothing is like that. -Don't you think
that there is a small difference?

1499
01:58:22,528 --> 01:58:24,792
- I don't feel so.
- Don't you feel cold?

1500
01:58:24,897 --> 01:58:28,890
Some type of cold is..
Oh gosh!

1501
01:58:30,036 --> 01:58:32,834
Gosh! My dhoti got stripped.

1502
01:58:33,239 --> 01:58:34,501
- What did you tell just now?
- I told something.

1503
01:58:34,607 --> 01:58:36,165
Do you tell her about my real identity?

1504
01:58:36,542 --> 01:58:39,306
I'll show your nudity
to all the colony people.

1505
01:58:40,680 --> 01:58:43,547
Can you tell what
this naughty Sanjay will do?

1506
01:58:43,749 --> 01:58:46,684
- You'll switch off the fountain.
- Abi, you got 10 percent mark.

1507
01:58:52,892 --> 01:58:54,359
Now I can go to the party peacefully.

1508
01:59:25,725 --> 01:59:30,628
This beauty looks like
a Jenifer Lopez sketch!

1509
01:59:35,801 --> 01:59:41,296
This Cadbury looks like
a replica of Britney Spears,

1510
01:59:45,811 --> 01:59:50,976
Her hip is like Shakeera,
with a lucky touch,

1511
01:59:51,083 --> 01:59:56,646
Her walking is like Bayonet,
her laugh can make holes,

1512
01:59:58,558 --> 02:00:03,586
Don't kill me with your wink
wearing jeans pant like James bond.

1513
02:00:03,696 --> 02:00:08,861
Don't play with nonchalk
as wearing a belt like Jackie Chan,

1514
02:00:43,069 --> 02:00:45,765
Are you the laser of deer eyes?

1515
02:00:46,205 --> 02:00:48,366
Are you the Paradise flavor?

1516
02:00:48,741 --> 02:00:51,107
Are you the oxidized lady bomb?

1517
02:00:51,210 --> 02:00:53,371
Are you the bend of Saxophone?

1518
02:00:53,679 --> 02:00:55,704
Are you the best friend of the volcano?

1519
02:00:56,148 --> 02:00:58,241
Are you 1000 volts electricity?

1520
02:00:58,684 --> 02:01:01,175
Are you the youth
falling on a tornado?

1521
02:01:01,287 --> 02:01:03,255
Are you the earthquake?

1522
02:01:03,422 --> 02:01:05,856
Are your both eyes radium bubbles?

1523
02:01:05,958 --> 02:01:08,392
Are your lips platinum flowers?

1524
02:01:08,494 --> 02:01:10,860
Is there romance if you say hello?

1525
02:01:10,963 --> 02:01:14,194
Is your silence a violence?

1526
02:01:15,901 --> 02:01:21,203
Monalisa will get angry hearing that
you are the part 2 of Titanic heroine,

1527
02:01:21,307 --> 02:01:25,869
Won't all the Sumo's greet you
that you have the looks of playboy?

1528
02:02:02,548 --> 02:02:04,573
Are you the DTS ring tone?

1529
02:02:05,084 --> 02:02:07,177
Are you the heart shape Moon?

1530
02:02:07,620 --> 02:02:10,054
Are you the beauty of CD-Rom software?

1531
02:02:10,156 --> 02:02:12,056
Are you chloroform anesthesia?

1532
02:02:12,625 --> 02:02:14,786
Are you the clone of Romeo?

1533
02:02:15,094 --> 02:02:17,062
Are the twin of Rainbow?

1534
02:02:17,563 --> 02:02:19,724
Are you the dean of dream university?

1535
02:02:19,832 --> 02:02:22,198
Are you my zodiac sign?

1536
02:02:22,301 --> 02:02:27,603
Are you 24 carat vanilla
or Hot Mexican tequila?

1537
02:02:27,707 --> 02:02:33,009
With fully loaded riffle
you raid me as Rambo,

1538
02:02:34,847 --> 02:02:40,080
Hey French model! You increased the pulse
rate as making Madonna as a ball,

1539
02:02:40,186 --> 02:02:44,816
Don't give me flying kiss
like how Maradona put a goal,

1540
02:03:04,477 --> 02:03:06,502
I've found a good alliance for you.

1541
02:03:08,080 --> 02:03:09,513
I saw a guy yesterday.

1542
02:03:09,882 --> 02:03:10,712
He is very handsome.

1543
02:03:10,816 --> 02:03:11,840
I don't want dad.

1544
02:03:15,554 --> 02:03:17,044
I can't hear just now.

1545
02:03:17,156 --> 02:03:18,248
I'll switch on speaker.

1546
02:03:19,492 --> 02:03:22,325
- Come again. -I saw that guy yesterday.
He is very handsome.

1547
02:03:22,428 --> 02:03:23,793
He is in Hyderabad.

1548
02:03:23,896 --> 02:03:25,386
He has a good job in TCS.

1549
02:03:25,498 --> 02:03:28,331
Let's see it later.
First tell me this. Is he fair?

1550
02:03:28,901 --> 02:03:32,200
He looks very white like an egg.

1551
02:03:32,304 --> 02:03:34,738
He will look red like a Tomato
when he feels shy.

1552
02:03:36,375 --> 02:03:38,605
If you see him you'll say
that he looks like Aravind Sami.

1553
02:03:38,711 --> 02:03:39,939
Shall I arrange your meeting
at his house?

1554
02:03:40,579 --> 02:03:42,137
It'll look cheap,
if we go like that.

1555
02:03:42,248 --> 02:03:45,046
Girls shouldn't be like hills..

1556
02:03:45,184 --> 02:03:46,208
They should be like mountains.

1557
02:03:46,318 --> 02:03:47,342
Only then there is dignity.

1558
02:03:47,453 --> 02:03:48,477
Ask him to come for lunch at Taj.

1559
02:03:50,723 --> 02:03:52,554
Originality should be in romance..

1560
02:03:53,125 --> 02:03:54,422
Copying other's ideas like..

1561
02:03:54,527 --> 02:03:57,291
It's a big sin as distributing British
company chocolates on August 15th.

1562
02:04:00,332 --> 02:04:03,563
- You Raasi! -What does it mean?
- A demon.

1563
02:04:03,736 --> 02:04:05,294
Short form is enough for you.

1564
02:04:06,071 --> 02:04:07,698
My name is Raghu Ram.

1565
02:04:08,874 --> 02:04:11,308
I am working as project leader in TCS.

1566
02:04:12,344 --> 02:04:14,904
Take home up to 70 thousand rupees.

1567
02:04:15,881 --> 02:04:18,645
Recently I bought a car.

1568
02:04:20,286 --> 02:04:23,312
I have almost all bank credit cards.

1569
02:04:25,624 --> 02:04:27,319
My parents also..

1570
02:04:30,830 --> 02:04:33,526
My work will get finished
in one hour in the morning.

1571
02:04:33,632 --> 02:04:36,260
After that I'll sit in internet.

1572
02:04:36,569 --> 02:04:38,264
I'll come early in the evenings.

1573
02:04:48,714 --> 02:04:50,147
Do you have food allergy?

1574
02:04:50,249 --> 02:04:51,876
I don't like snake-guard.

1575
02:04:53,319 --> 02:04:56,288
Now what you are
eating is snake-guard.

1576
02:04:59,191 --> 02:05:01,625
- Why money? -It's difficult
to happen his marriage.

1577
02:05:01,727 --> 02:05:03,752
I'll hit and kill you with the paper.

1578
02:05:03,863 --> 02:05:05,763
Hey Pranav! Come here.

1579
02:05:05,865 --> 02:05:08,231
- Calling me in singular?
- Who is it? Is it that idiot?

1580
02:05:08,334 --> 02:05:10,564
You can't bear it when
I call you in plural. You'll die.

1581
02:05:10,669 --> 02:05:13,035
Where are you going
wearing the coat?

1582
02:05:13,138 --> 02:05:15,971
- To get eggs.
- Eggs! To whom?

1583
02:05:16,075 --> 02:05:18,100
- For madam.
- For madam?

1584
02:05:18,410 --> 02:05:20,708
- What will you do with it?
- I'll make omelets.

1585
02:05:21,347 --> 02:05:22,974
It's enough that.
Come here.

1586
02:05:23,082 --> 02:05:25,243
- What? -There is
some work with you.

1587
02:05:25,618 --> 02:05:27,313
- Sit.
- No thanks.

1588
02:05:28,220 --> 02:05:29,312
Unnecessary trouble!

1589
02:05:29,889 --> 02:05:31,857
- Take this thousand rupee note..
- Is it a thousand rupee note?

1590
02:05:32,625 --> 02:05:34,252
Buy full bottle.

1591
02:05:36,095 --> 02:05:38,325
Not that sir, he gave me 10 rupees
and saying it is a thousand rupee note..

1592
02:05:39,298 --> 02:05:40,788
Go away.

1593
02:05:41,300 --> 02:05:42,733
- Hey Pranav!
- Sir!

1594
02:05:43,636 --> 02:05:45,934
- Chicken is over. So, 2 plates of chicken.
- I want prawns.

1595
02:05:46,038 --> 02:05:48,802
2 plates prawns for him.
And a fish for him.

1596
02:05:49,441 --> 02:05:51,466
- Get it all these.
- In this thousand rupees..

1597
02:05:51,577 --> 02:05:54,011
Yes, don't cr.
Keep the change with you.

1598
02:05:54,647 --> 02:05:56,740
- Are you telling me to keep the change
if it remains? -Yes man!

1599
02:05:56,849 --> 02:05:58,476
Can't you get it?
Go.

1600
02:06:02,855 --> 02:06:03,822
Who is he?

1601
02:06:03,989 --> 02:06:05,547
This house isn't looking like
where respected people stay.

1602
02:06:05,658 --> 02:06:07,285
Strangers are coming here as their wish.

1603
02:06:08,193 --> 02:06:11,959
Hey snake-guard! Stop there.
Respected people are living in this house.

1604
02:06:16,535 --> 02:06:19,035
She won't get up if we
don't ring the bell like that.

1605
02:06:24,209 --> 02:06:25,836
What Raghu? You have come here.

1606
02:06:27,012 --> 02:06:28,240
That is..

1607
02:06:31,417 --> 02:06:33,248
We want to talk.

1608
02:06:34,019 --> 02:06:34,986
Talk.

1609
02:06:35,154 --> 02:06:36,314
Tell me what the news is.

1610
02:06:39,758 --> 02:06:42,921
We want to talk personally.

1611
02:06:43,762 --> 02:06:45,457
What personal talk at midnight?

1612
02:06:45,564 --> 02:06:47,395
Are you thinking that
this is a whore house?

1613
02:06:47,700 --> 02:06:49,258
- What?
- I didn't mean it sir.

1614
02:06:49,368 --> 02:06:52,860
- What? -I got
discharged in the evening.

1615
02:06:53,038 --> 02:06:55,336
She would be worrying thinking of me.

1616
02:06:55,841 --> 02:06:56,808
Is it she?

1617
02:07:06,518 --> 02:07:10,614
She loved me for an year but now she isn't
caring of me when I consume raw alcohol.

1618
02:07:10,723 --> 02:07:14,352
You got introduced just 2 days back
Will she care of you?

1619
02:07:18,597 --> 02:07:19,825
We want some privacy.

1620
02:07:19,932 --> 02:07:21,832
I too want Aiswariya Rai
but it won't happen.

1621
02:07:21,934 --> 02:07:24,164
If you make trouble here
I'll call Pranav.

1622
02:07:24,336 --> 02:07:25,894
Pranav?

1623
02:07:26,872 --> 02:07:30,638
Is he Arnold Schwarzenegger?
You expect him to save you.

1624
02:07:31,143 --> 02:07:33,043
I'll do her whatever I wish.

1625
02:07:33,145 --> 02:07:36,512
Let me see what will
that Pranav do.

1626
02:07:36,615 --> 02:07:40,449
Don't get emotional for me.

1627
02:07:42,154 --> 02:07:43,121
Have you got it?

1628
02:07:43,822 --> 02:07:45,653
Go down and
make the pegs ready. Go.

1629
02:07:45,758 --> 02:07:47,055
I don't know sir.

1630
02:07:48,694 --> 02:07:52,061
- You crazy Pranav! Will everything
come along the birth? -Then how?

1631
02:07:52,164 --> 02:07:54,064
You'll mix 2 or 3 pegs wrongly.

1632
02:07:54,633 --> 02:07:56,999
- I'll hit you hard.
- Is it me?

1633
02:07:57,503 --> 02:07:58,731
Then you'll know it automatically.

1634
02:07:58,837 --> 02:08:02,671
Go and make it ready.
Go away.

1635
02:08:02,775 --> 02:08:04,402
Seems he'll kill me.

1636
02:08:04,510 --> 02:08:06,944
- Damn steps also there!
- Where is the balance money?

1637
02:08:07,846 --> 02:08:08,870
Balance money?

1638
02:08:10,449 --> 02:08:13,418
When I give you thousand rupees, won't you
tell me the accounts? -Thousand rupees?

1639
02:08:14,186 --> 02:08:15,483
You asked me to keep the change.

1640
02:08:15,587 --> 02:08:18,021
I said like that?
It's my kind heart.

1641
02:08:18,257 --> 02:08:20,225
But you should give it.
It's your manners.

1642
02:08:20,325 --> 02:08:22,225
When he is scolding you
why do you listen it?

1643
02:08:22,327 --> 02:08:23,487
They are hitting me, madam.

1644
02:08:24,530 --> 02:08:27,556
- Is he hitting you?
- They are hitting me without a reason.

1645
02:08:27,800 --> 02:08:29,290
- Are your complaints over?
- Isn't it truth, sir?

1646
02:08:29,401 --> 02:08:30,561
Go down, I'll see to you.

1647
02:08:30,669 --> 02:08:32,830
- Go down. -I'll go.
I've to get down on steps again.

1648
02:08:34,339 --> 02:08:35,306
- Baggi?
- You..

1649
02:08:35,407 --> 02:08:36,840
What is it? You are calling her
as your own wife.

1650
02:08:36,942 --> 02:08:38,910
I have stopped to call
you like that, isn't it Baggi?

1651
02:08:39,945 --> 02:08:40,969
I'll take it.
You can go.

1652
02:08:43,615 --> 02:08:44,980
He is going.
Let him go.

1653
02:08:54,159 --> 02:08:55,524
He is doing nuisance.

1654
02:08:55,761 --> 02:08:57,854
Why should he bother
when I talk to Raghu?

1655
02:08:57,963 --> 02:09:00,591
At last he is hitting Pranav also.

1656
02:09:01,567 --> 02:09:03,467
Why are you staring?
Speak something.

1657
02:09:04,970 --> 02:09:07,063
How can he tell it than this
that he is loving you?

1658
02:09:08,240 --> 02:09:09,935
Some people write letters.

1659
02:09:10,175 --> 02:09:11,870
Some people give flowers.

1660
02:09:11,977 --> 02:09:13,274
You do lie.

1661
02:09:13,645 --> 02:09:15,408
He shouts and beats.

1662
02:09:15,714 --> 02:09:17,011
It's his expression.

1663
02:09:19,118 --> 02:09:21,086
When our dad rejected
our marriage proposal..

1664
02:09:21,253 --> 02:09:22,948
...He didn't convince him.

1665
02:09:23,188 --> 02:09:25,622
Do you know what he told
when I ask him the reason?

1666
02:09:25,858 --> 02:09:29,817
I'm not a sales man to convince you..

1667
02:09:29,928 --> 02:09:31,020
...that your life will be nice
if you marr me.

1668
02:09:41,340 --> 02:09:43,171
You can get freedom at Sanju.

1669
02:09:43,675 --> 02:09:47,167
To tell it in a simple manner..
Raghu is like a park.

1670
02:09:47,546 --> 02:09:49,104
After going for a week,..

1671
02:09:49,214 --> 02:09:52,240
...there won't be new things to know.

1672
02:09:53,018 --> 02:09:54,110
Sanju is like a forest..

1673
02:09:54,620 --> 02:09:58,112
He daily gives a surprise,
till the death.

1674
02:10:00,225 --> 02:10:03,922
He is loving you more than I.

1675
02:10:12,905 --> 02:10:13,929
Have it.

1676
02:10:14,439 --> 02:10:17,602
What wrong I did?
I got so many problems.

1677
02:10:17,976 --> 02:10:20,342
When I was enjoying my life
besides studying degree..

1678
02:10:20,579 --> 02:10:24,606
She came into my life, exposes..

1679
02:10:24,716 --> 02:10:27,947
...wearing saris and flattered me.

1680
02:10:28,187 --> 02:10:30,280
Will you leave me in
the middle of the road?

1681
02:10:30,589 --> 02:10:33,683
Lord Anjaneya! Tomorrow
I'll come to your temple..

1682
02:10:33,792 --> 02:10:36,693
...I'll definitely come,
make me to forget her.

1683
02:10:37,196 --> 02:10:38,220
Oh god!

1684
02:10:39,198 --> 02:10:40,631
Why did you hit me now sir?

1685
02:10:41,066 --> 02:10:44,627
If you tell to anyone that I am crying..

1686
02:10:46,071 --> 02:10:48,767
Are you waiting that..

1687
02:10:48,874 --> 02:10:49,898
...I didn't complete the dialogue?

1688
02:10:50,008 --> 02:10:51,703
- Yes! -I didn't.
- Oh gosh!

1689
02:10:51,810 --> 02:10:52,970
- It's my wish.
- Oh god!

1690
02:10:53,078 --> 02:10:55,569
Tell it wherever you want.

1691
02:10:55,681 --> 02:10:57,911
If we tell him respectively
he won't listen to us.

1692
02:10:58,016 --> 02:11:00,712
- Let's slap him and tell it.
- Till now you are slapping me, isn't it?

1693
02:11:00,819 --> 02:11:02,980
You lay down.

1694
02:11:09,761 --> 02:11:12,594
Seems Sanjay Sahu and
Bagumathi are joined.

1695
02:11:12,698 --> 02:11:15,189
He couldn't get a plate meals
easily in his life.

1696
02:11:15,300 --> 02:11:16,995
Then how can he get his fiancée.

1697
02:11:17,102 --> 02:11:19,002
He couldn't get anything easily.

1698
02:11:19,104 --> 02:11:21,538
...he should get hurt for that.

1699
02:11:21,640 --> 02:11:24,666
The problem which has come
now is Damodhar Reddy.

1700
02:11:30,249 --> 02:11:31,614
How do you know that I am here?

1701
02:11:33,118 --> 02:11:34,085
Tell me what the matter is.

1702
02:11:34,186 --> 02:11:35,346
Look there!

1703
02:11:37,122 --> 02:11:39,682
Tell me what the matter is.

1704
02:11:42,728 --> 02:11:44,093
What a timing of yours!

1705
02:11:48,333 --> 02:11:52,167
Brothers! You wait here.
I'll come back sending sister-in-law.

1706
02:11:52,271 --> 02:11:53,169
Come.

1707
02:12:01,413 --> 02:12:04,314
I'll call you and tell it.
You go.

1708
02:12:16,228 --> 02:12:18,458
Why did you come with applying dots?

1709
02:12:18,764 --> 02:12:19,731
To kill me!

1710
02:13:04,743 --> 02:13:06,108
You'll get a hard kick.

1711
02:13:14,419 --> 02:13:18,446
When we are fighting seriously
why he is standing idle?

1712
02:13:18,824 --> 02:13:20,121
I didn't like his action.

1713
02:13:20,359 --> 02:13:21,986
That's why there is
a small change in the fight.

1714
02:13:22,094 --> 02:13:23,721
But the remaining fight
will be done as it is.

1715
02:13:42,047 --> 02:13:43,537
Stop you bull!

1716
02:13:57,529 --> 02:13:59,360
Didn't I tell you that
you'll get a hard kick?

1717
02:14:14,079 --> 02:14:15,774
Bright smile!
I didn't expect it.

1718
02:14:17,349 --> 02:14:18,782
Dear!

1719
02:14:21,420 --> 02:14:22,785
Who has sent you to here?

1720
02:14:24,022 --> 02:14:25,046
Tell me.

1721
02:14:25,157 --> 02:14:26,317
What to do?

1722
02:14:26,892 --> 02:14:28,792
I should find it out in
a hard manner like Chiranjeevi.

1723
02:14:36,435 --> 02:14:37,993
God! The coconut broke well.

1724
02:14:38,103 --> 02:14:39,866
Similarly Munna's head will break like it.

1725
02:14:42,507 --> 02:14:44,737
He didn't take it much care..

1726
02:14:44,843 --> 02:14:48,006
...when bombs are blasting
and his friend getting stabbed.

1727
02:14:48,113 --> 02:14:52,550
But he got hurt for making trouble
while a girl is telling him I Love You.

1728
02:14:52,984 --> 02:14:56,420
It is the moment, he noticed
Damodhar Reddy seriously.

1729
02:14:56,922 --> 02:15:00,358
It is the same moment, the death
is looking for Damodhar Reddy.

1730
02:15:06,665 --> 02:15:09,634
Munna! I am coming.

1731
02:15:19,744 --> 02:15:21,507
Let's enjoy!

1732
02:15:25,617 --> 02:15:26,481
Enjoy it,

1733
02:15:44,236 --> 02:15:49,139
- Let's enjoy,
- Enjoy it,

1734
02:16:03,255 --> 02:16:06,747
Do anyone know how will tsunami
look when it comes in front?

1735
02:16:07,325 --> 02:16:11,318
Ever!
Can we know ever?

1736
02:16:11,730 --> 02:16:14,961
Do anyone know how the sound will be
when a cyclone knocks at the door?

1737
02:16:15,400 --> 02:16:19,029
If you don't know, look at him!
He is the human tsunami,

1738
02:16:19,404 --> 02:16:23,431
He's a real danger,
you've got to believe me,

1739
02:16:50,035 --> 02:16:58,135
He will become Mount Everest,
if you want to measure his height,

1740
02:16:58,243 --> 02:17:06,343
if you think how can he fight,
he'll put you in a stretcher

1741
02:17:06,518 --> 02:17:10,420
if you think he's grass pile that
can be cut, he'll chew you,

1742
02:17:10,855 --> 02:17:14,757
Giving a pin if you ask him
to make a garland, he'll dig the mound

1743
02:17:57,969 --> 02:18:01,735
if you think he is your friend,

1744
02:18:02,107 --> 02:18:06,009
becoming a flight,
he'll take you on his shoulders,

1745
02:18:06,111 --> 02:18:10,013
if you think he is your enemy,

1746
02:18:10,448 --> 02:18:14,282
becoming a danger,
he'll make you a corpse in seconds,

1747
02:18:14,719 --> 02:18:18,348
When I ask him some flowers,
he gets baskets of flowers,

1748
02:18:18,523 --> 02:18:22,550
if the death rope hangs to his neck,
he'll make a swing of it,

1749
02:18:54,626 --> 02:18:57,060
Greetings! They were not allowed
parking outside.

1750
02:18:57,195 --> 02:18:58,093
So here is..

1751
02:19:09,040 --> 02:19:10,268
I too joined in Margadarsi.

1752
02:19:11,242 --> 02:19:12,675
And bought a gun.

1753
02:19:16,514 --> 02:19:18,414
- Who is he?
- Damodhar Reddy.

1754
02:19:18,783 --> 02:19:19,613
Where does he stay?

1755
02:19:40,538 --> 02:19:41,937
Our Munna told me about you.

1756
02:19:42,540 --> 02:19:44,098
Uncle! I can't get a thing..

1757
02:19:44,409 --> 02:19:45,569
There're people to do murder for..

1758
02:19:45,677 --> 02:19:47,907
...the happiness in brother-in-law's eyes
and anger in sister's eyes

1759
02:19:48,146 --> 02:19:49,977
I don't have any connection with you..

1760
02:19:50,949 --> 02:19:51,973
What is this all?

1761
02:19:52,350 --> 02:19:53,510
Is there no connection?

1762
02:19:55,487 --> 02:19:56,647
Why are you staring like that?

1763
02:19:57,021 --> 02:19:59,581
Are we your fans to follow you?

1764
02:20:01,760 --> 02:20:03,660
6 years ago you hit my men

1765
02:20:04,362 --> 02:20:06,387
I left you as you were in
the agony of your father's death.

1766
02:20:08,233 --> 02:20:10,258
5 years ago you robbed my wealth

1767
02:20:10,568 --> 02:20:13,002
I kept quiet that you were
in the fast in perseverance.

1768
02:20:13,304 --> 02:20:16,330
You arranged meetings in my place
and buried flags in my land.

1769
02:20:16,641 --> 02:20:17,869
You made me lose my kingdom
and coming to the city..

1770
02:20:17,976 --> 02:20:20,536
...do settlements for livelihood.

1771
02:20:21,045 --> 02:20:22,273
I thought my time wasn't good.

1772
02:20:22,981 --> 02:20:24,676
You hit on my influence.

1773
02:20:25,850 --> 02:20:27,147
I thought that I didn't have God's grace.

1774
02:20:27,452 --> 02:20:29,943
But, 8 years ago you hit on my chest.

1775
02:20:30,054 --> 02:20:30,952
Don't you remember it?

1776
02:20:52,544 --> 02:20:53,442
Do you know who he is?

1777
02:20:56,014 --> 02:20:59,973
My son.
He is younger son to me.

1778
02:21:02,420 --> 02:21:03,853
He should be roaming like a tiger..

1779
02:21:07,425 --> 02:21:11,657
...but he is lying in Vikram hospital
as a coma patient.

1780
02:21:13,765 --> 02:21:15,323
Since 8 years..

1781
02:21:15,700 --> 02:21:16,860
If it comes to us,
it'll be a problem.

1782
02:21:17,569 --> 02:21:23,030
If it comes to our relatives,
it'll be the hell.

1783
02:21:28,446 --> 02:21:29,674
To show you, all these happened.

1784
02:21:30,448 --> 02:21:32,075
Rowdies who kidnapped your friends.

1785
02:21:32,517 --> 02:21:34,348
Made to run madly after the car..

1786
02:21:34,652 --> 02:21:36,085
The bombs which blasted
in front of your eyes..

1787
02:21:36,254 --> 02:21:40,190
These all are like onion to kill the rat.

1788
02:21:41,526 --> 02:21:42,891
Do you know why I did all these?

1789
02:21:43,461 --> 02:21:45,156
You shouldn't be scared to die.

1790
02:21:46,865 --> 02:21:48,298
You should be scared to live.

1791
02:21:50,602 --> 02:21:52,627
Fear! I don't know how it is.

1792
02:21:52,804 --> 02:21:56,240
But I feel good watching it
on opponent's eyes.

1793
02:21:57,141 --> 02:22:03,137
Mostly it'll be glad to me
seeing it in your eyes.

1794
02:22:10,021 --> 02:22:13,115
After hearing what you said,
I thought one thing.

1795
02:22:13,758 --> 02:22:18,286
The money, name, position, influence
and the land. You have everything.

1796
02:22:19,163 --> 02:22:20,255
Except fear!

1797
02:22:22,166 --> 02:22:25,397
Except you watching the fear in your
opponent eyes you never did fear, isn't it?

1798
02:22:26,571 --> 02:22:27,799
This is not a big issue.

1799
02:22:28,373 --> 02:22:30,398
With in short time,
you will get scared

1800
02:22:30,508 --> 02:22:31,406
I'll make it happen.

1801
02:22:32,176 --> 02:22:35,077
Bulli Reddy! Tell uncle
that I stand on my words.

1802
02:22:38,316 --> 02:22:40,944
It's my responsibility
to make you piss in fear.

1803
02:22:42,453 --> 02:22:46,355
You idiot! What do you
think of yourself?

1804
02:22:46,524 --> 02:22:49,891
Leave my hand.
Go away.

1805
02:22:51,329 --> 02:22:52,489
You..

1806
02:22:54,332 --> 02:22:58,428
Lord Krishna! You are my protector,

1807
02:22:58,603 --> 02:22:59,968
After I stopped using abuse words,
then why do you..

1808
02:23:07,011 --> 02:23:08,342
Why should we've trouble between us?

1809
02:23:08,980 --> 02:23:11,380
Let us work as a team.
What?

1810
02:23:12,951 --> 02:23:14,509
Didn't I tell you?
Your work will be finished.

1811
02:23:14,619 --> 02:23:18,180
Definitely I'll give you.
Not in grams and kilos.

1812
02:23:20,558 --> 02:23:21,786
I'll give you in tonnes..

1813
02:23:22,961 --> 02:23:28,024
Fear!

1814
02:23:46,184 --> 02:23:47,378
Let's meet after the marriage.

1815
02:23:51,255 --> 02:23:52,313
She doesn't like it dad!

1816
02:23:52,991 --> 02:23:54,424
Did I conduct your
marriage with your willing?

1817
02:24:00,932 --> 02:24:03,264
Have you seen her face?
With crying face.

1818
02:24:03,801 --> 02:24:05,428
You may tell to your dad
that she doesn't like it.

1819
02:24:05,670 --> 02:24:08,036
- I already told. He's taking
out my love story. Oh gosh!

1820
02:24:08,139 --> 02:24:09,106
No need of all that.

1821
02:24:12,744 --> 02:24:14,234
Exchange your rings.

1822
02:24:32,497 --> 02:24:33,589
Has the betrothal finished?

1823
02:24:35,967 --> 02:24:39,994
What Bulli Reddy? Which one has
become slow, we or the time?

1824
02:24:40,905 --> 02:24:43,271
They did in a hurry.
No problem.

1825
02:24:43,841 --> 02:24:48,073
Give the ring to him and
give your daughter to his elder son.

1826
02:24:53,184 --> 02:24:54,151
Don't scare.

1827
02:24:55,653 --> 02:24:57,348
He isn't a rowdy like my second son.

1828
02:24:58,456 --> 02:24:59,889
He'll take care your daughter very well.

1829
02:25:01,959 --> 02:25:03,085
No need of dowr.

1830
02:25:04,862 --> 02:25:07,558
Charge sheets can have
rowdies and goons names..

1831
02:25:08,032 --> 02:25:09,226
...but not the invitation.

1832
02:25:09,867 --> 02:25:11,596
I have 1000 crores of wealth.

1833
02:25:12,103 --> 02:25:13,434
There are 100 cases on you.

1834
02:25:13,871 --> 02:25:14,838
Why do I need that?

1835
02:25:15,673 --> 02:25:17,163
If you can vacate the place,
I've so many work to do.

1836
02:25:20,144 --> 02:25:21,975
You told to tell him
the truth before the betrothal.

1837
02:25:22,480 --> 02:25:24,038
Have you seen what happened
before we told it?

1838
02:25:24,482 --> 02:25:26,382
That's why your father has come
after you got the ring.

1839
02:25:34,826 --> 02:25:35,656
He is our boy.

1840
02:25:35,827 --> 02:25:38,261
You won't give him your daughter
if you know that his father got arrested.

1841
02:25:38,362 --> 02:25:40,262
We made him tell a small lie
that his father is dead.

1842
02:25:42,300 --> 02:25:43,927
Your girl's horoscope is nice.

1843
02:25:44,035 --> 02:25:46,367
The muhurtham has been fixed here
and he got the bail there.

1844
02:25:46,571 --> 02:25:48,129
We have come straight from the jail.

1845
02:25:48,573 --> 02:25:50,268
We are waiting in the car outside
for half an hour..

1846
02:25:50,641 --> 02:25:51,801
...to come here after
finishing exchanging the rings.

1847
02:25:52,443 --> 02:25:54,604
I didn't do this marriage
out of anger on you.

1848
02:25:55,313 --> 02:25:58,282
- Your daughter's..
- Her lover!

1849
02:26:00,585 --> 02:26:02,416
I am doing this with anger on him

1850
02:26:05,857 --> 02:26:09,884
I heard a good muhurtham
is there in tomorrow morning 10.20.

1851
02:26:10,728 --> 02:26:14,220
He'll conduct their
marriage at that time.

1852
02:26:15,199 --> 02:26:16,359
You both are invited.

1853
02:26:18,136 --> 02:26:21,537
You go and sit inside the car.
You too.

1854
02:26:23,608 --> 02:26:25,041
I am a police officer.

1855
02:26:26,010 --> 02:26:27,307
This threats are not new to me.

1856
02:26:28,479 --> 02:26:30,071
I can also behave as a rowdy at present.

1857
02:26:31,482 --> 02:26:33,450
Don't make me behave like that.

1858
02:26:47,565 --> 02:26:50,659
If I start to enter,
it's beginning only.

1859
02:26:51,235 --> 02:26:53,795
You yourself think
how worst the ending will be.

1860
02:26:55,973 --> 02:27:00,569
- You go dear!
Go. -Dear!

1861
02:27:01,646 --> 02:27:03,944
Look sir! If you come
as daughter's father..

1862
02:27:04,148 --> 02:27:06,480
...you may stand in the marriage hall,
it'll be respectful to you.

1863
02:27:06,584 --> 02:27:08,017
Or else, Home minister
will come to the marriage..

1864
02:27:08,119 --> 02:27:09,677
...you will have to guard in the entrance.

1865
02:27:09,921 --> 02:27:11,081
But it is sure that
the marriage will happen.

1866
02:27:11,255 --> 02:27:13,416
Madam! You tell your husband.

1867
02:27:23,467 --> 02:27:25,697
I too offered a light
to this dark world..

1868
02:27:25,803 --> 02:27:27,964
Wow! It's very excellent.

1869
02:27:28,339 --> 02:27:30,500
It is very wonderful and original.

1870
02:27:35,847 --> 02:27:37,576
Did Damodhar Reddy come yesterday
after the engagement got over?

1871
02:27:39,250 --> 02:27:41,081
He came.
Why not?

1872
02:27:41,853 --> 02:27:43,480
The guy who is going to become your
future son-in-law is already his son..

1873
02:27:43,721 --> 02:27:45,814
He threatened you and took Bagi with them
The marriage is tomorrow's morning.

1874
02:27:47,658 --> 02:27:49,319
He kept Bagi in his house.

1875
02:27:50,461 --> 02:27:52,554
Goons and rowdies are guarding
the house with weapons.

1876
02:27:52,864 --> 02:27:54,422
Damn goons and weapons!

1877
02:27:54,799 --> 02:27:57,495
- 40 or 50 dogs are also there.
- Dogs?

1878
02:27:59,136 --> 02:28:01,161
If dogs are there,
I can't do it.

1879
02:28:01,606 --> 02:28:03,096
I can manage with goons..

1880
02:28:03,207 --> 02:28:04,640
...but there is a language
problem between the dogs and me.

1881
02:28:05,610 --> 02:28:07,703
If we tr to escape,
they have 4 legs and I have 2 legs!

1882
02:28:08,613 --> 02:28:10,513
If any situations come that
they catch my calf..

1883
02:28:11,215 --> 02:28:12,239
...I don't have enough calf.

1884
02:28:12,350 --> 02:28:14,113
And if it catches my neck,
dog death will happen.

1885
02:28:15,419 --> 02:28:16,977
Dog death means
we are not killing the dog..

1886
02:28:17,088 --> 02:28:19,454
...we'll die by the dog.
It is called dog death.

1887
02:28:19,724 --> 02:28:22,784
Ok, don't worry somehow
I'll stop her marriage..

1888
02:28:29,700 --> 02:28:32,066
Are you thinking how I've come here?
That is wonder.

1889
02:28:32,570 --> 02:28:33,468
You should believe it.

1890
02:28:33,971 --> 02:28:35,063
You'll be happy if you believe it.

1891
02:28:35,706 --> 02:28:37,867
Have a tea, go home and sleep well..

1892
02:28:37,975 --> 02:28:39,840
...wake up and go to the marriage
by wearing the suit which you like.

1893
02:28:40,111 --> 02:28:41,601
After what will happen..

1894
02:28:42,246 --> 02:28:44,806
I don't say uncle,
I feel shy. Watch on the screen.

1895
02:28:45,316 --> 02:28:46,214
See you uncle.

1896
02:28:56,060 --> 02:28:57,220
Greetings! Are you fine?

1897
02:28:58,663 --> 02:28:59,823
- Have meals and go.
- Sure.

1898
02:29:01,732 --> 02:29:02,630
Move aside.

1899
02:29:03,734 --> 02:29:06,294
- Greetings!
- What is this dress?

1900
02:29:07,471 --> 02:29:09,769
- Didn't you tell him?
- What should I tell him?

1901
02:29:10,074 --> 02:29:11,234
Look! How the bride looks like..

1902
02:29:11,409 --> 02:29:12,842
She isn't looking like to marr..

1903
02:29:13,744 --> 02:29:15,041
...she looks like
to enter into the movies.

1904
02:29:16,147 --> 02:29:17,171
Bring the dhoti!

1905
02:29:27,959 --> 02:29:30,086
- Give phone to sir?
- Wait a minute.

1906
02:29:30,761 --> 02:29:31,887
Sir! A call for you..

1907
02:29:33,564 --> 02:29:35,122
Sir! I am Sidhu speaking..

1908
02:29:35,299 --> 02:29:36,197
Your second son is missing.

1909
02:29:36,300 --> 02:29:38,530
We searched whole hospital
and called everyone of our guys.

1910
02:29:49,447 --> 02:29:52,280
Come, they have gone.

1911
02:29:52,717 --> 02:29:56,016
- Come, they have gone.
- What about me?

1912
02:30:09,066 --> 02:30:10,294
I want to learn Kung fu from you..

1913
02:30:10,668 --> 02:30:11,760
Do you want to learn Kung fu?

1914
02:30:12,203 --> 02:30:13,101
No problem, learn it.

1915
02:30:13,270 --> 02:30:14,965
- I'll join you today itself.
- Will you join today itself?

1916
02:30:15,139 --> 02:30:16,231
You are very interested in it.

1917
02:30:16,741 --> 02:30:18,766
Look! We should do warm ups
before learning Kung fu.

1918
02:30:18,943 --> 02:30:20,308
- Do you know how to warm up?
- I don't know sir.

1919
02:30:21,812 --> 02:30:23,302
You have to make your body loosely.

1920
02:30:23,414 --> 02:30:24,642
If you loose our body..

1921
02:30:25,950 --> 02:30:27,941
And again we do warm up
before going to fight.

1922
02:30:31,222 --> 02:30:32,120
Don't worry at all.

1923
02:30:32,423 --> 02:30:35,153
I'll call a batch like this
to teach Kung fu a guy like you.

1924
02:30:35,826 --> 02:30:37,987
I'll teach you practically
with this batch.

1925
02:30:38,162 --> 02:30:39,459
- See carefully and learn it.
- Ok sir.

1926
02:30:39,563 --> 02:30:40,860
It's like a small trial part.

1927
02:31:07,324 --> 02:31:08,416
You play! Why do you scare of them?

1928
02:32:34,545 --> 02:32:36,843
Why are you all coming
like for freedom fight?

1929
02:32:39,950 --> 02:32:43,283
So far I haven't killed anyone
and I hit very carefully.

1930
02:32:43,888 --> 02:32:45,981
After seeing you all I lost my patience.

1931
02:32:46,090 --> 02:32:50,083
Come forward.
I don't know what will happen to you.

1932
02:32:53,964 --> 02:32:54,931
You idiot!

1933
02:32:56,767 --> 02:33:00,203
Come forward whoever has
affection for your boss.

1934
02:33:00,571 --> 02:33:04,530
If you had come here for liquor
and biriyani packets.. go back.

1935
02:33:05,509 --> 02:33:07,340
I am telling you.
Run away.

1936
02:33:55,626 --> 02:33:57,457
Don't build up muscles
for your body only..

1937
02:33:58,629 --> 02:34:01,120
...learn to build up for fingers too.

1938
02:34:11,375 --> 02:34:14,071
I can't see your defeat.

1939
02:36:22,506 --> 02:36:23,495
This is the fear of sign.

1940
02:36:25,442 --> 02:36:28,275
Even having the food when
you don't eat it, it's fasting.

1941
02:36:28,579 --> 02:36:31,480
Even having the cot when you
don't go to bed, it's guarding.

1942
02:36:32,116 --> 02:36:33,674
Having the sword in hands
when get the anger..

1943
02:36:34,718 --> 02:36:37,619
...and having the person to kill,
leaving him is humanity

1944
02:36:38,322 --> 02:36:39,311
I have it.

1945
02:36:40,891 --> 02:36:43,519
Do you have it?

1946
02:36:49,800 --> 02:36:52,291
Shall I tell you a top secret?

1947
02:36:52,403 --> 02:36:54,701
You know who stopped this marriage.
It is you only.

1948
02:36:55,072 --> 02:36:56,039
How?

1949
02:37:06,950 --> 02:37:08,247
He should be roaming like a tiger..

1950
02:37:09,753 --> 02:37:12,119
...but he is in Vikram hospitals
bed as a patient in coma.

1951
02:37:13,557 --> 02:37:14,990
I went to Vikram hospital straightly.

1952
02:37:15,959 --> 02:37:17,187
I gave 4 thousand rupees to the nurse.

1953
02:37:18,095 --> 02:37:19,585
I gave a thousand rupees
to the watchman..

1954
02:37:19,696 --> 02:37:21,527
They allowed me
to take whole hospital.

1955
02:37:21,698 --> 02:37:23,791
I said I don't want it, I kidnapped
your son and brought him out.

1956
02:37:24,168 --> 02:37:25,863
After kidnapping where should I hide him?

1957
02:37:29,239 --> 02:37:30,729
Sanjay Sahu got a brilliant idea.

1958
02:37:30,908 --> 02:37:32,341
What the brilliant idea was..

1959
02:37:32,709 --> 02:37:33,869
Excuse me where is the Urvasi bar?

1960
02:37:34,111 --> 02:37:36,944
Urvasi bar? Go straight,
there comes a junction..

1961
02:37:37,047 --> 02:37:38,605
...-If you ask anyone there,
they'll tell you. -Is it there?

1962
02:37:38,982 --> 02:37:39,949
Come on guys.

1963
02:37:43,587 --> 02:37:44,952
4 guys have come
and 3 guys have left.

1964
02:37:45,122 --> 02:37:46,089
What happened to the another guy?

1965
02:37:47,124 --> 02:37:50,753
I hid him into the car dicky
which you decorated for the marriage.

1966
02:37:58,402 --> 02:37:59,892
Have you seen my humanity, uncle?

1967
02:38:00,404 --> 02:38:02,167
We arranged carefully oxygen
and glucose without missing him..

1968
02:38:02,539 --> 02:38:03,563
...even you did bad to me.

1969
02:38:04,475 --> 02:38:05,635
Do you have any sense?

1970
02:38:06,543 --> 02:38:08,511
You wasted 8 months to catch me.

1971
02:38:08,745 --> 02:38:10,440
Instead of that if you had took care
of him since he was in 8..

1972
02:38:10,614 --> 02:38:12,377
...now he would have become
a great person like Abdul Kalam.

1973
02:38:13,484 --> 02:38:15,179
Don't enter into others
personal matters.

1974
02:38:15,686 --> 02:38:19,349
Uncle! You don't do studying like us,
attending interviews..

1975
02:38:19,490 --> 02:38:21,321
...going for jobs and paying taxes.

1976
02:38:21,492 --> 02:38:22,982
I am asking you to live happily.

1977
02:38:23,227 --> 02:38:24,194
What should I do more than this?

1978
02:38:24,495 --> 02:38:25,519
Should I die?

1979
02:38:25,629 --> 02:38:27,790
That's why I tell you,
let's live as our wish.

1980
02:38:27,898 --> 02:38:29,593
You go in the car doing rowdyism

1981
02:38:29,700 --> 02:38:31,258
I'll go along without knowing anything.

1982
02:38:31,568 --> 02:38:33,502
If you get down wherever you want..

1983
02:38:33,871 --> 02:38:34,997
...the situation will be like this.

1984
02:38:35,906 --> 02:38:37,874
Nowadays the guys are very dangerous.

1985
02:38:39,109 --> 02:38:40,906
If you quarrel them,
they'll kill you as comedy.

1986
02:38:42,246 --> 02:38:44,009
If you don't convince
even I've told so far..

1987
02:38:44,448 --> 02:38:47,315
...bring a fresh batch tomorrow
but not like these people.

1988
02:38:48,318 --> 02:38:52,880
For fighting, scolding, killing
and at last for warm talking..

1989
02:38:53,123 --> 02:38:56,957
...I always wait for 24 hours
C\o Osmania canteen, Hyderabad..

1990
02:38:57,127 --> 02:38:58,890
...I am very hot buddy!

1991
02:39:04,067 --> 02:39:05,398
When I kicked slowly,
why did it cut down like that?

1992
02:39:07,271 --> 02:39:10,434
CM sir! What we have to
understand seeing this?

1993
02:39:10,741 --> 02:39:13,369
If the sword cut down into the road
when a slim guy like me kicked..

1994
02:39:13,944 --> 02:39:15,571
What we have to understand seeing this..

1995
02:39:15,679 --> 02:39:17,704
...the contractors are swindling
government money.

1996
02:39:18,015 --> 02:39:19,778
Anyhow with an immediate effect
you've to stop this..

1997
02:39:20,150 --> 02:39:22,584
...I wish that you'll do it
and I am leaving from here.

1998
02:39:28,425 --> 02:39:30,256
- What again? -Why did you
leave him alive without killing?

1999
02:39:35,499 --> 02:39:38,127
To win in the battle field,
we don't kill the opponent..

2000
02:39:39,036 --> 02:39:40,333
...and make him to defeat the opponent.

2001
02:39:41,371 --> 02:39:42,804
- What did I tell you?
- To make him defeat.

2002
02:39:42,906 --> 02:39:43,804
To make him defeat..

2003
02:39:44,975 --> 02:39:46,806
The aim of the battle is
to make to defeat

2004
02:39:47,644 --> 02:39:48,611
...but not to killing.

2005
02:39:56,453 --> 02:39:57,420
What happened to my father?

2006
02:39:57,588 --> 02:39:59,283
I didn't kill him. But if he dies,
I won't be the responsible.

2007
02:39:59,389 --> 02:40:00,879
- It's enough you gave
me that gap. -Go.

2008
02:40:01,658 --> 02:40:02,886
All of you close your eyes.

2009
02:40:06,129 --> 02:40:07,494
Why did they become like that?

2010
02:40:12,669 --> 02:40:15,229
Don't know the reason but Damodhar Reddy
don't speak to anyone after that.

2011
02:40:15,806 --> 02:40:17,899
With the shame of that he got
defeat before their men..

2012
02:40:18,342 --> 02:40:20,037
...or in the agony of Bulli Reddy died.

2013
02:40:20,611 --> 02:40:21,908
He stopped talking.

2014
02:40:22,613 --> 02:40:24,103
What the sad news was..

2015
02:40:24,481 --> 02:40:28,315
He was admitted in the hospital
the same day when his son got discharged.

2016
02:40:29,019 --> 02:40:32,250
Daily in the evenings
they took him to the same park.

2017
02:40:32,756 --> 02:40:35,418
He was watching the knife stick
which was on the middle of the road.

2018
02:40:35,959 --> 02:40:38,189
How the people of India
don't bother about the things..

2019
02:40:38,862 --> 02:40:41,387
...similarly they don't bother
about that knife stick.

2020
02:40:42,165 --> 02:40:43,655
2 people only could tell what it was..

2021
02:40:44,167 --> 02:40:46,135
One is the guy who came to learn Kung fu.

2022
02:40:46,236 --> 02:40:47,328
Second one is Damodhar Reddy.

2023
02:40:47,804 --> 02:40:50,204
No one would ask him
and this one won't speak out.

2024
02:40:50,907 --> 02:40:52,397
After 6 months on a fine day..

2025
02:40:52,909 --> 02:40:54,274
Have you stopped drinking
because of Bagi?

2026
02:40:54,845 --> 02:40:56,335
Do one thing.
Leave Bagi.

2027
02:40:56,446 --> 02:40:57,572
- You can drink daily.
- It's better.

2028
02:40:58,115 --> 02:40:59,343
See! Your cell phone is ringing.

2029
02:40:59,449 --> 02:41:00,416
May be it is your fiancée.

2030
02:41:01,184 --> 02:41:02,014
It's like that
if marriage happens..

2031
02:41:02,185 --> 02:41:04,153
- Look at these roamers!
- Yes.

2032
02:41:10,527 --> 02:41:11,824
What is this stick?
Why is it on the middle of the road?

2033
02:41:14,665 --> 02:41:17,964
- Sir! What happened?
- Hey bring the car!

2034
02:41:19,202 --> 02:41:21,636
The sword which was the reason to kill..

2035
02:41:21,805 --> 02:41:26,242
...a great faction leader
by this ordinary Sanjay Sahu..

2036
02:41:26,943 --> 02:41:28,240
...has remained under the road.

2037
02:41:28,812 --> 02:41:31,042
Another road was put on
that after a few years.

2038
02:41:31,548 --> 02:41:33,072
This time the contractor
was a good person..

2039
02:41:33,617 --> 02:41:35,585
...with that the knife
never been disclosed.

2040
02:41:57,574 --> 02:42:00,008
What is it? You don't
get tense. I'll take care of it.

2041
02:42:00,110 --> 02:42:01,202
Do something.

2042
02:42:06,249 --> 02:42:07,614
- It's me Seenu.
- Tell me Seenu.

2043
02:42:08,118 --> 02:42:10,552
A small problem has come to the girl
for whom we helped for marriage.

2044
02:42:11,188 --> 02:42:12,155
Wait a minute.

2045
02:42:12,923 --> 02:42:15,016
You contact some lawyer.
Why do you ask me?

2046
02:42:15,125 --> 02:42:16,752
- Ok sir, I'll contact a lawyer, bye.
- Listen Seenu!

2047
02:42:18,862 --> 02:42:19,760
He won't come to good.

2048
02:42:21,331 --> 02:42:22,958
What about the party?

2049
02:42:26,470 --> 02:42:28,097
Take this thousand rupees
and get a full bottle.

2050
02:42:29,940 --> 02:42:32,841
- Is it a thousand rupees note?
- Do you want a loan? -Yes sir.

2051
02:42:33,143 --> 02:42:34,041
What purpose?

2052
02:42:34,411 --> 02:42:36,641
- A friend of mine got married.
- So what?

2053
02:42:37,414 --> 02:42:38,904
He gave a wedding party.

2054
02:42:39,950 --> 02:42:41,918
- Did you pay the bill?
- He only paid.

2055
02:42:42,219 --> 02:42:45,450
- Then why do you need money?
- He is a unique guy.

2056
02:42:45,922 --> 02:42:47,583
He gives 10 rupees
but says it is 1000 rupees.

2057
02:42:48,759 --> 02:42:50,056
And he asks for the balance money also.

2058
02:42:51,895 --> 02:42:53,795
It is difficult to tell you in detail.

2059
02:42:54,765 --> 02:42:56,460
Give me 3 lakh rupees loan.

2060
02:42:56,900 --> 02:43:00,063
If I go to them empty-handed,
they'll hit me.
