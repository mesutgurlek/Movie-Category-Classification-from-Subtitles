1
00:02:42,506 --> 00:02:44,474
Goa 1958.

2
00:02:47,511 --> 00:02:51,208
India attained freedom in 1947.

3
00:02:51,916 --> 00:02:55,477
But Goa was under
Portuguese rule till 1961.

4
00:02:58,522 --> 00:03:00,490
This is a city of Goa, Vasco.

5
00:03:07,932 --> 00:03:10,492
And this is Alberto Vasco.

6
00:03:10,801 --> 00:03:12,996
He owns the maximum land here.

7
00:03:13,537 --> 00:03:16,005
In a way, he is the king.

8
00:03:16,540 --> 00:03:20,101
That is why this city
is named after him.

9
00:03:22,546 --> 00:03:26,175
And his statue is put up
in the central square.

10
00:03:27,551 --> 00:03:30,452
Before him, nobody had
been honored thus.

11
00:03:32,156 --> 00:03:34,124
That day, the scene was festive.

12
00:03:34,992 --> 00:03:36,459
All the town sfolk had gathered.

13
00:03:37,494 --> 00:03:39,223
Everyone was cheerful.

14
00:03:39,496 --> 00:03:42,124
They were congratulating him
with heart felt wishes.

15
00:03:43,500 --> 00:03:44,967
Except for one woman.

16
00:03:49,506 --> 00:03:50,871
You pig!!

17
00:03:53,911 --> 00:03:57,745
What do you think of yourself?
May worms feed on your body!

18
00:04:01,518 --> 00:04:05,147
Nobody will give you a sip
of water when you die!

19
00:05:18,529 --> 00:05:21,089
Forget it. We are not
to go into that area!

20
00:05:24,535 --> 00:05:25,900
I'll see you!

21
00:05:33,477 --> 00:05:37,174
This is the statue of Alberto
Vasco, the biggest land owner.

22
00:05:38,482 --> 00:05:40,450
He owned more than half the city.

23
00:05:40,884 --> 00:05:42,784
That is how this city
was named Vasco.

24
00:05:43,487 --> 00:05:46,115
When the Portuguese
left Goa 20 years ago...

25
00:05:46,490 --> 00:05:49,459
These big landlords left
their property behind.

26
00:05:51,495 --> 00:05:55,124
They grabbed everything,
but it's good for us.

27
00:05:55,499 --> 00:05:59,128
You'll get the kind
of place you want.

28
00:05:59,503 --> 00:06:01,130
Because there's no real owner.

29
00:06:01,839 --> 00:06:03,067
Driver, stop the car.

30
00:06:06,176 --> 00:06:07,473
I want that house.

31
00:06:08,512 --> 00:06:12,243
- For the company guesthouse.
- Sure. You'll get it.

32
00:06:17,521 --> 00:06:20,490
Bihari, stop these hoodlums!
Why are they breaking my house?

33
00:06:21,025 --> 00:06:22,822
Does the house become yours
if you encroach on it?

34
00:06:23,527 --> 00:06:28,931
You are the tenant. Sign here and
you'll get 5000 or you get nothing.

35
00:06:33,470 --> 00:06:35,836
All right.

36
00:06:39,476 --> 00:06:41,103
I'll meet you at the shop.

37
00:06:41,478 --> 00:06:42,843
Your stool, uncle.

38
00:06:46,483 --> 00:06:49,043
He went there to steal and
the Eagles beat him up!

39
00:06:50,487 --> 00:06:53,047
Idiot! Come on.

40
00:07:10,841 --> 00:07:12,468
Jojo! Run!

41
00:08:06,897 --> 00:08:08,296
The Bichhus(Scorpions)
Have come to thrash us!

42
00:08:08,499 --> 00:08:09,966
Come on, Michael.

43
00:08:54,545 --> 00:08:56,012
Hey you dog!

44
00:08:57,548 --> 00:09:01,507
Didn't I say, you guys
must not step into our area?

45
00:09:08,959 --> 00:09:12,520
A dozen of you have ensconced
yourselves here for 2 years.

46
00:09:14,565 --> 00:09:17,193
Since then Vasco has
had problems.

47
00:09:18,569 --> 00:09:21,538
Before that, you Christians
did the ball dance here!

48
00:09:24,575 --> 00:09:27,203
Hey pig, have you forgotten
last time's thrashing?

49
00:09:28,512 --> 00:09:30,207
You escaped because
Father Jacob intervened.

50
00:09:30,514 --> 00:09:31,981
Remember what I said then?

51
00:09:32,916 --> 00:09:35,976
This side of the ground is ours
and that side is yours.

52
00:09:36,520 --> 00:09:38,818
Now you must live there, and die there.

53
00:09:39,523 --> 00:09:40,888
Get the buildings and
homes on that side vacated.

54
00:09:41,525 --> 00:09:42,992
Or I'll break your legs
and place them on your hands!

55
00:09:44,528 --> 00:09:45,893
Do you think I'm easy meat?

56
00:09:46,530 --> 00:09:48,498
Does your father own Vasco?

57
00:09:51,034 --> 00:09:52,501
Why? Didn't your mother tell you?

58
00:10:15,959 --> 00:10:17,517
We are in our spirits

59
00:10:20,564 --> 00:10:22,122
Sobe in your senses

60
00:10:29,506 --> 00:10:31,474
Don't you glare at us

61
00:10:37,814 --> 00:10:39,475
Let'shear that again

62
00:10:48,859 --> 00:10:50,486
We're in the spirits too

63
00:10:53,530 --> 00:10:55,088
You had better be
in your senses

64
00:11:02,205 --> 00:11:04,901
Don't you give us
those dirty looks...

65
00:11:10,047 --> 00:11:12,174
What did you say?
...come again

66
00:11:56,493 --> 00:11:59,485
I've come across
several guys like you

67
00:11:59,863 --> 00:12:02,889
Just tell us what
you're getting at

68
00:12:04,935 --> 00:12:11,898
Go away; don't come here.
And don't mess with us

69
00:12:31,194 --> 00:12:35,255
Go on, get lost...
Stop fibbing... we're not scared

70
00:12:35,499 --> 00:12:37,467
You're ignorant.
If you have the guts...

71
00:12:37,667 --> 00:12:39,464
Come and face me...
- You have a fight!

72
00:12:40,170 --> 00:12:41,865
What do you take me for?

73
00:12:51,515 --> 00:12:53,483
What did you say...?
Come again

74
00:13:51,007 --> 00:13:57,879
Beware... careful!
You had better be careful of us

75
00:13:59,282 --> 00:14:06,882
Lay off! Keep away...
they're all scared of us

76
00:14:25,542 --> 00:14:29,444
Stop making a noise. Come out
in the open, if you want a fight

77
00:14:29,746 --> 00:14:31,611
- I'm alert...
- And ready

78
00:14:31,882 --> 00:14:35,841
What are you worth...?
Who the hell are you?

79
00:14:49,966 --> 00:14:51,797
We are in the spirits...

80
00:14:54,304 --> 00:14:55,965
Talk sense

81
00:14:58,508 --> 00:15:01,875
We are in the spirits...
- So talk sense

82
00:15:02,979 --> 00:15:05,470
Don't you glare at us

83
00:15:08,518 --> 00:15:10,884
What did you say...?
Come again

84
00:15:39,482 --> 00:15:40,847
Arrest all these boys!

85
00:15:41,084 --> 00:15:44,110
Sir, what have I done?
I was just arm wrestling with brother.

86
00:15:44,888 --> 00:15:48,449
Sir, I said I'd drop him to
Calan gute on my mobike, isn't it?

87
00:15:50,160 --> 00:15:53,459
Yes Sir, and I said I'd drop him
in my Mercedes tempo.

88
00:15:53,997 --> 00:15:55,464
So... coming pal?

89
00:15:55,899 --> 00:15:58,459
That is why we thought
we'd wrestle arms to decide.

90
00:16:01,504 --> 00:16:05,873
See that, D'costa? Sometimes
they fight, sometimes they love...

91
00:16:06,509 --> 00:16:08,739
They should have been married!

92
00:16:13,516 --> 00:16:15,313
The mention of marriage
makes you laugh, huh?

93
00:16:16,519 --> 00:16:19,147
Bichhu married to an Eagle. Where?

94
00:16:20,523 --> 00:16:21,888
In prison!

95
00:16:23,526 --> 00:16:25,494
Did these children fight again?

96
00:16:26,529 --> 00:16:28,759
Children...?
These children?

97
00:16:29,466 --> 00:16:32,833
Last week they broke 4 street
lights, the entire vegetable market...

98
00:16:33,470 --> 00:16:35,768
And Rodriques' new car.

99
00:16:40,477 --> 00:16:43,275
I would handcuff
them even in jail!

100
00:16:46,483 --> 00:16:50,351
Why do you fight? Want to
show your strength to each other?

101
00:16:52,489 --> 00:16:54,787
I know you are young,
full of spirit.

102
00:16:55,492 --> 00:16:59,451
Instead of breaking each others'
bones, make something of yourselves.

103
00:17:00,497 --> 00:17:01,794
Live together like brothers.

104
00:17:02,499 --> 00:17:05,263
Remember my words,
life is very precious.

105
00:17:06,503 --> 00:17:09,199
Once this time is lost,
it will never return.

106
00:17:11,508 --> 00:17:12,941
Remember my words.

107
00:17:16,513 --> 00:17:18,481
Spare them this time.
They are immature.

108
00:17:19,516 --> 00:17:22,076
- They won't repeat this.
- You're making a mistake.

109
00:17:22,519 --> 00:17:24,487
They are dangerous, not immature!

110
00:17:25,021 --> 00:17:26,488
Yet I spare them for your sake.

111
00:17:29,459 --> 00:17:32,428
Even if you pluck a leaf
from a tree, watch it!

112
00:17:34,464 --> 00:17:36,432
Come on. Move!

113
00:17:39,135 --> 00:17:40,432
Now all of you go away.

114
00:17:41,471 --> 00:17:42,768
Get on with your jobs.

115
00:17:50,480 --> 00:17:52,948
- You got into a fight again?
- No father, they started it!

116
00:17:53,483 --> 00:17:54,950
The dogs...!

117
00:17:56,486 --> 00:17:58,454
But if they start a fight,
we can't keep quiet...

118
00:18:03,493 --> 00:18:05,791
This blood shed will not help.

119
00:18:05,895 --> 00:18:08,455
But they started it.
We were just...

120
00:18:08,665 --> 00:18:10,292
I want to see you in church.

121
00:18:11,501 --> 00:18:13,469
- This Sunday?
- Every Sunday.

122
00:19:02,952 --> 00:19:05,921
You come in last, yet
want to leave first.

123
00:19:08,558 --> 00:19:12,858
It's Max' fault. It takes so long
to wake him up! He's still sleeping!

124
00:19:39,856 --> 00:19:43,155
- There's a jam session in
college on Saturday. - So...?

125
00:19:44,527 --> 00:19:48,486
- Why? - The Purple Riot
Band has come from Bombay.

126
00:20:01,544 --> 00:20:02,909
What happened?

127
00:20:05,548 --> 00:20:07,015
Look at her hand!

128
00:20:13,223 --> 00:20:14,520
May I read your palm?

129
00:20:17,560 --> 00:20:18,925
You have a terrific lifeline!

130
00:20:19,963 --> 00:20:21,521
And take a look at this love line...

131
00:20:28,504 --> 00:20:30,472
Never seen one like this!

132
00:20:31,507 --> 00:20:33,475
Solid...!

133
00:20:36,512 --> 00:20:37,809
What's his name?

134
00:20:43,519 --> 00:20:46,977
Okay, I'll answer that.
Does his name begin with T?

135
00:20:52,528 --> 00:20:56,157
- Dog! Want one?
- No!

136
00:20:56,532 --> 00:20:58,500
No? Of course you'll want one!

137
00:20:58,868 --> 00:21:00,495
- Yes!
- Then why did you say no?

138
00:21:01,537 --> 00:21:05,496
Next time you flirt with my
sister, you'll get thrashed!

139
00:21:18,554 --> 00:21:20,522
It's going to be twelve.
Let's meet the strike.

140
00:21:21,557 --> 00:21:24,526
We must reach home
before the twelve gongs.

141
00:21:25,561 --> 00:21:28,052
But you must only count the
gong. Don't tell me to turn.

142
00:21:35,505 --> 00:21:38,474
- Careful!
- What are you doing?

143
00:21:59,529 --> 00:22:02,498
- Look ahead!
- Aunt, give way!

144
00:22:12,875 --> 00:22:14,502
No problems now!

145
00:22:18,548 --> 00:22:20,846
Leave her and turn right!

146
00:22:50,279 --> 00:22:51,473
But why did you scream?

147
00:22:53,516 --> 00:22:55,143
Who screamed? I...

148
00:23:01,524 --> 00:23:03,253
- You tell him...
- No, you!

149
00:23:05,528 --> 00:23:06,995
The brakes had failed.

150
00:23:12,535 --> 00:23:14,002
But you didn't make it.

151
00:23:15,538 --> 00:23:17,506
I'll go get my bike serviced.

152
00:23:18,541 --> 00:23:20,008
The bike is fine.
It was your mistake.

153
00:23:20,543 --> 00:23:22,511
Why did you get involved
with Rose Anne?

154
00:23:23,546 --> 00:23:27,346
- Today is not a good day.
- Rubbish! It's very special.

155
00:23:27,550 --> 00:23:29,177
What's special about today?

156
00:23:37,493 --> 00:23:38,858
I'm sorry, I forgot.

157
00:23:40,496 --> 00:23:42,862
What little sister? We were born
on the same day at the same time...

158
00:23:42,999 --> 00:23:44,466
But I was born 15 seconds early.

159
00:24:07,523 --> 00:24:08,820
Do you like it?

160
00:24:11,527 --> 00:24:12,824
You made it yourself?

161
00:24:18,534 --> 00:24:21,002
- It's not for this!
- But this fits best in it.

162
00:24:23,539 --> 00:24:24,904
For me?

163
00:24:31,481 --> 00:24:34,279
Whether Max remembers your
birthday or not, I will.

164
00:24:37,487 --> 00:24:41,287
You remember it only because I too
was born on the same day, same time.

165
00:25:09,519 --> 00:25:12,488
...5,6,7,8,9, 10.

166
00:25:13,523 --> 00:25:14,990
One thousand and one.

167
00:25:16,526 --> 00:25:18,494
Your fees for getting
the house evacuated.

168
00:25:20,530 --> 00:25:22,157
You may keep the one buck.

169
00:25:24,534 --> 00:25:27,162
Bihari, you are great!

170
00:25:27,537 --> 00:25:28,936
It looks absolutely real!

171
00:25:30,473 --> 00:25:34,432
Here's your share of
...10, 10 and 5.25000.

172
00:25:36,879 --> 00:25:38,847
We do the threatening and breaking.

173
00:25:39,482 --> 00:25:41,450
And this scoundrel,
Bihari reaps the rewards

174
00:25:43,986 --> 00:25:45,453
I say to hell with Bihari.

175
00:25:46,489 --> 00:25:48,457
Why don't we do direct
dealing with Chaudhary?

176
00:25:49,492 --> 00:25:54,452
The idea is good but Bihari
forges the property papers.

177
00:25:55,498 --> 00:25:57,125
Who will do the writing for us?

178
00:26:03,506 --> 00:26:04,973
Little guy!

179
00:26:05,508 --> 00:26:06,975
My brother!

180
00:26:08,511 --> 00:26:11,480
You rogue! You've turned
stylish! Like a Bombayite!

181
00:26:12,515 --> 00:26:14,813
But you are just the same.

182
00:26:15,518 --> 00:26:18,316
Come on, Vasco is that way.

183
00:26:22,525 --> 00:26:26,154
Mother! Come downstairs!
Rahul has come back!

184
00:26:31,801 --> 00:26:33,769
Chottu, get the bagsout.

185
00:26:44,480 --> 00:26:46,448
He looks terrific!

186
00:26:46,983 --> 00:26:48,450
Then what? Whose brother is he?

187
00:26:50,486 --> 00:26:52,454
I've thought of a great plan for us.

188
00:26:52,888 --> 00:26:54,446
- Me too.
- You say first.

189
00:26:54,890 --> 00:26:56,858
We all will live in Bombay.

190
00:26:58,494 --> 00:27:00,860
Life is great there.

191
00:27:01,497 --> 00:27:03,465
Man's luck changes in a minute.

192
00:27:04,500 --> 00:27:08,129
What is left in Vasco? Will
mother agree to come to Bombay?

193
00:27:09,505 --> 00:27:11,473
The guys selling the caftan
made a fool out of you.

194
00:27:13,509 --> 00:27:14,976
There's a hole in this.

195
00:27:15,511 --> 00:27:18,810
Give it back to Rahul. He'll
return it. He's going back.

196
00:27:19,515 --> 00:27:22,882
- You're going back?
- Not alone. All of us will go.

197
00:27:23,519 --> 00:27:25,749
I'll open a big fast food restaurant.

198
00:27:26,022 --> 00:27:27,751
Indian, foreign every style.

199
00:27:28,457 --> 00:27:31,255
Mr. Shetty will put up the
capital and my training.

200
00:27:31,794 --> 00:27:34,422
In a year, I'll take you
to the skies, mother!

201
00:27:34,964 --> 00:27:37,091
I don't want to reach anywhere.
I will stay here.

202
00:27:37,466 --> 00:27:39,434
- But mother, over there...
- You may go.

203
00:27:41,470 --> 00:27:43,438
- Leave tomorrow itself.
- No, mother.

204
00:27:43,739 --> 00:27:47,436
- I'm here for a month.
- Why are you wasting time?

205
00:27:47,810 --> 00:27:50,108
You've seen the place.
You've fixed everything.

206
00:27:50,479 --> 00:27:53,778
Why did you come here?
You could have written.

207
00:27:55,484 --> 00:27:59,853
Pack this in his bag. Invest what
you get on returning it in your hotel.

208
00:28:00,489 --> 00:28:03,788
Mother! Did you have
to tell her right now?

209
00:28:04,493 --> 00:28:06,256
I'd have explained to her.
Now she is angry with me.

210
00:28:06,762 --> 00:28:08,730
So? She saw you after two years.

211
00:28:09,498 --> 00:28:12,194
You've been home for barely 5 hours
and you're talking of returning!

212
00:28:12,501 --> 00:28:14,469
Pinhead, see Vasco.

213
00:28:14,904 --> 00:28:17,134
I am confident you won't leave it.

214
00:28:24,513 --> 00:28:28,210
Rest tonight. I'll show you
the sights of Vasco tomorrow.

215
00:28:47,536 --> 00:28:50,334
Come here. Sorry, I'm late.
Some important work cropped up.

216
00:28:50,873 --> 00:28:52,500
This is my brother, Rahul.

217
00:28:53,542 --> 00:28:57,501
He's very educated, a chef.
That means an English cook.

218
00:28:57,947 --> 00:29:01,110
And these are my pals.
That is Lafdu. Chandu.

219
00:29:04,553 --> 00:29:07,522
That is Chottu and Dasan.

220
00:29:08,557 --> 00:29:11,253
And he's special, Bheja Fry.

221
00:29:14,563 --> 00:29:16,531
Those two are the
newcomers, Devand Pepsi.

222
00:29:18,567 --> 00:29:22,264
Why are you smiling? Show
Rahul the sights of Vasco.

223
00:29:26,575 --> 00:29:28,475
So Prakash is the boss
of the Bichhu gang?

224
00:29:29,011 --> 00:29:31,878
Do you know from dogs and cats
to important men, salute him?

225
00:29:33,916 --> 00:29:35,315
We saw Maria's house on the way?

226
00:29:35,785 --> 00:29:39,482
He pays expenses to the guys who
forcibly live there, to evacuate it.

227
00:29:40,523 --> 00:29:42,491
He'll thrash them...

228
00:29:44,527 --> 00:29:46,495
so this is the businessof Bicchu gang

229
00:29:49,031 --> 00:29:51,499
In a while, everyone
will salute you too.

230
00:29:53,936 --> 00:29:55,494
Don't call me a hood!

231
00:29:56,539 --> 00:29:58,507
And there's no need to be my guide.

232
00:29:59,208 --> 00:30:00,505
I'll see the place myself.

233
00:30:09,552 --> 00:30:11,520
- Rahul!
- Sir!

234
00:30:12,555 --> 00:30:14,523
- Don't go ahead.
- Why?

235
00:30:14,824 --> 00:30:16,257
We're standing on the borderline!

236
00:30:16,559 --> 00:30:20,017
- What border? - That side of
the ground belongs to the eagles!

237
00:30:23,566 --> 00:30:25,864
Eagle gang is the sworn
enemy of the Bichhu gang!

238
00:30:26,569 --> 00:30:29,470
Nobody from that gang
can come to our area.

239
00:30:30,005 --> 00:30:31,973
And our boys can't go there!

240
00:30:32,508 --> 00:30:33,805
Not even by mistake!

241
00:30:34,510 --> 00:30:37,809
Not by mistake.
But he can go on purpose.

242
00:30:41,517 --> 00:30:42,984
You must not go ahead!

243
00:32:11,206 --> 00:32:16,166
You are the princess
of my dreams...

244
00:32:17,947 --> 00:32:20,916
You put everything around
to shade

245
00:32:21,050 --> 00:32:23,917
So come and take my hand

246
00:32:24,720 --> 00:32:29,453
You put everything
around to shade...

247
00:33:17,373 --> 00:33:21,503
Here she comes...
bathed in roses

248
00:33:24,046 --> 00:33:28,449
She brings the
fragrance with her

249
00:33:43,899 --> 00:33:48,859
It's your eyes...
they're intoxicating

250
00:33:50,806 --> 00:33:55,869
Your beauty, I behold

251
00:33:57,513 --> 00:34:03,884
You are the Princess
of my dreams...

252
00:34:04,720 --> 00:34:07,883
You have put everything
around to shade

253
00:34:08,023 --> 00:34:10,491
Come and take my hand

254
00:34:58,674 --> 00:35:02,872
It'smagic...
you have cast a spell

255
00:35:05,514 --> 00:35:09,883
I can't control
my heart anymore

256
00:35:27,269 --> 00:35:32,434
Tell me at least so much,
Oh celestial beauty...

257
00:35:33,976 --> 00:35:38,845
Where do you live?
And what is your name?

258
00:35:41,049 --> 00:35:46,851
O Princess of my dreams...

259
00:35:47,456 --> 00:35:50,857
You have put everything around
to shade

260
00:35:51,360 --> 00:35:53,851
So take my hand

261
00:36:20,522 --> 00:36:24,322
I don't know you but
I felt like talking to you.

262
00:36:31,466 --> 00:36:34,435
- Are you new to this place?
- Yes. I came on Friday.

263
00:36:36,471 --> 00:36:40,430
My family is here for 2 years
but I was studying in Bombay.

264
00:36:42,477 --> 00:36:44,445
This is the first time
I've come to Goa.

265
00:36:45,480 --> 00:36:46,777
It's a beautiful place.

266
00:36:54,156 --> 00:36:55,453
Just a minute.

267
00:36:58,493 --> 00:37:02,452
I thought it would be great
if somebody could show me around.

268
00:37:07,502 --> 00:37:09,868
- My name is...
- What have you seen in Vasco?

269
00:37:12,507 --> 00:37:15,476
The ground, the beach and the old fort

270
00:37:18,247 --> 00:37:19,805
Have you seen Max?

271
00:37:21,516 --> 00:37:22,983
What is that?

272
00:37:24,519 --> 00:37:27,750
You must meet him.
He'll show you everything.

273
00:37:28,457 --> 00:37:30,425
Lights at night, stars in the day...

274
00:37:33,462 --> 00:37:34,827
You too will like him a lot.

275
00:37:46,475 --> 00:37:48,272
He's a first rate scoundrel!

276
00:37:50,879 --> 00:37:53,279
Why should we talk of that hood, Max?

277
00:37:56,885 --> 00:37:59,945
Do you know why I've called you here?

278
00:38:00,489 --> 00:38:01,786
For lunch.

279
00:38:03,492 --> 00:38:08,452
- Then...? - For many days
I've been wanting to say something.

280
00:38:09,498 --> 00:38:14,458
Each time I see you,
my heart says something.

281
00:38:18,507 --> 00:38:20,737
- What did you say?
- Not to you. There...

282
00:38:22,010 --> 00:38:25,138
- There's nobody there.
- There isn't?

283
00:38:27,516 --> 00:38:29,984
Do you know I met your Daddy?

284
00:38:30,519 --> 00:38:32,214
- When?
- Two days ago.

285
00:38:32,521 --> 00:38:33,988
He was buying brandy.

286
00:38:37,526 --> 00:38:39,494
He was fighting for 3 bucks.

287
00:38:40,028 --> 00:38:42,223
I looked at him and said...

288
00:38:43,532 --> 00:38:45,500
You scoundrel! You've come here too!

289
00:38:46,535 --> 00:38:48,901
- I didn't mean you.
- You meant my Daddy!

290
00:38:49,037 --> 00:38:50,504
Not even your Daddy!

291
00:38:51,540 --> 00:38:52,905
These hoods have come here!

292
00:38:56,545 --> 00:38:59,844
- May I sit here?
- No, we're having a private lunch.

293
00:39:03,218 --> 00:39:04,515
What have you ordered?

294
00:39:06,555 --> 00:39:09,023
- Why are you abusing me?
- It's the name of the dish.

295
00:39:09,558 --> 00:39:12,527
Then say so. What is added to it?

296
00:39:13,562 --> 00:39:16,861
- What? - It's a Chinese dish.
It will have cockroaches.

297
00:39:18,066 --> 00:39:20,534
No, I'll tell you its' ingredients.

298
00:39:21,903 --> 00:39:23,530
It's got noodles and chicken.

299
00:39:24,573 --> 00:39:26,939
Prawns and a few carrots.

300
00:39:27,576 --> 00:39:29,305
Capsicum and mushrooms...

301
00:39:29,511 --> 00:39:30,978
But no cockroaches.

302
00:39:31,513 --> 00:39:33,208
How does one eat it?

303
00:39:33,515 --> 00:39:34,880
Chew it with your teeth.

304
00:39:36,018 --> 00:39:38,213
- And how is the taste?
- Spicy.

305
00:39:38,520 --> 00:39:40,488
A little sweet; a little spicy.

306
00:39:42,024 --> 00:39:44,219
Must be a delicious, sweet feeling.

307
00:39:44,526 --> 00:39:46,824
- Take it away and eat it!
- That's what I think.

308
00:39:48,030 --> 00:39:49,998
- This...
- I thought you meant Rose.

309
00:39:50,532 --> 00:39:51,829
I can't eat your lunch.

310
00:39:53,535 --> 00:39:55,230
These days we're dieting.

311
00:39:55,537 --> 00:39:58,005
- Yes. - You eat it.
- I don't want it.

312
00:39:58,206 --> 00:39:59,503
- Eat it.
- I don't want it!

313
00:40:01,543 --> 00:40:02,908
We're leaving.

314
00:40:10,552 --> 00:40:16,923
Were you not here, I'd have beaten,
cut him and made Manchurian of him!

315
00:40:18,560 --> 00:40:19,925
Eat quietly now.

316
00:40:20,562 --> 00:40:25,864
How can I eat? I wanted to
tell you something special.

317
00:40:26,568 --> 00:40:30,470
You are the largest part of my life...

318
00:40:32,507 --> 00:40:34,134
Cockroach!

319
00:40:51,526 --> 00:40:54,984
Hooligan! Max! Why are you after me?

320
00:40:59,534 --> 00:41:01,001
Don't you know?

321
00:41:12,547 --> 00:41:15,516
Rose Anne humiliated you
in front of Savio once again.

322
00:41:16,551 --> 00:41:19,850
She loves me a lot but her
style of flirting is different.

323
00:41:23,558 --> 00:41:27,961
I was in church and this boy
came and sat right next to me.

324
00:41:28,497 --> 00:41:30,192
Right under Father's nose.

325
00:41:32,167 --> 00:41:34,965
And said, this is the
first time I've come to Goa.

326
00:41:35,504 --> 00:41:37,472
I wish somebody would take me
around Vasco town, etc, etc...

327
00:41:40,008 --> 00:41:41,873
- Who was he?
- I don't know.

328
00:41:42,177 --> 00:41:43,474
He was openly flirting.

329
00:41:44,513 --> 00:41:46,481
Next time you see him, tell me.

330
00:41:57,926 --> 00:42:00,486
Wow! So many potato chips?

331
00:42:00,929 --> 00:42:03,489
I'll give you two box fulls.
Take them to Bombay.

332
00:42:04,032 --> 00:42:05,499
And think of your mother there!

333
00:42:07,536 --> 00:42:09,504
How about if I eat all
these chips right here?

334
00:42:10,539 --> 00:42:11,836
What do you mean?

335
00:42:12,541 --> 00:42:14,008
I mean, I have made a decision.

336
00:42:14,209 --> 00:42:15,506
I won't go to Bombay.

337
00:42:17,546 --> 00:42:21,505
- Really?
- Yes, I'll stay here. With you.

338
00:42:22,551 --> 00:42:25,179
- I'll open a small shop here.
- That's great!

339
00:42:25,554 --> 00:42:28,455
Are you happy, mother?
Don't worry about the shop.

340
00:42:28,890 --> 00:42:30,858
I'll fix everything
tomorrow. Little guy!

341
00:42:33,495 --> 00:42:35,793
You've won the jackpot, uncle!

342
00:42:36,498 --> 00:42:39,865
My brother adores your
shop that's lying vacant.

343
00:42:40,101 --> 00:42:42,797
I'll take it on rent.
I'll pay 500 a month.

344
00:42:44,005 --> 00:42:46,473
Okay, I'll pay 600 but paint it.

345
00:42:47,509 --> 00:42:48,976
I want 25000 as deposit.

346
00:42:49,511 --> 00:42:52,480
And 5000 rent per month.
Talk if it's acceptable.

347
00:42:52,847 --> 00:42:54,144
Are you giving the Taj?

348
00:42:55,016 --> 00:42:56,483
Why are you interrupting?

349
00:42:56,851 --> 00:42:59,979
- Give it happily or...
- Let me talk.

350
00:43:02,190 --> 00:43:03,487
What do you want to say?

351
00:43:04,025 --> 00:43:07,483
I'm just beginning.
I need your co-operation.

352
00:43:08,530 --> 00:43:11,499
- If you...
- I see, I see everything!

353
00:43:11,933 --> 00:43:14,299
He's threatening me from
there! Hooligan! Ruffian!

354
00:43:14,936 --> 00:43:16,904
Old man! You think we're crazy?

355
00:43:17,205 --> 00:43:19,332
Even pigeons don't lay eggs
in that ruin of yours!

356
00:43:21,543 --> 00:43:23,511
If I don't go what will you do,
you land grabbing swindler?

357
00:43:25,213 --> 00:43:27,010
He took the land when
his landlord died.

358
00:43:27,549 --> 00:43:29,449
He's asking for 5000 when he
doesn't pay the rent himself!

359
00:43:30,485 --> 00:43:32,043
You bald...!

360
00:43:32,487 --> 00:43:35,183
Call a midi or a bell-bottom!

361
00:43:35,490 --> 00:43:37,287
- Call anybody...
- Brother, let go!

362
00:43:38,493 --> 00:43:39,960
I'll see who comes to your help!

363
00:43:58,013 --> 00:43:59,480
Let go of uncle.

364
00:44:00,515 --> 00:44:02,483
Should I hold you?

365
00:44:22,537 --> 00:44:24,505
Let go or I'll chop you right here!

366
00:44:30,478 --> 00:44:32,946
I say, leave him! Let go!

367
00:44:40,488 --> 00:44:44,117
Why did you interfere?
I'd have dealt with Max!

368
00:44:45,493 --> 00:44:47,461
Mother is right, you are out of hand!

369
00:44:47,829 --> 00:44:49,126
The shop is our of our hands.

370
00:44:49,497 --> 00:44:51,192
Would your fisticuffs
have got it for us?

371
00:44:51,499 --> 00:44:53,967
- Of course! - That is how
we have to set tenants right.

372
00:44:54,502 --> 00:44:56,299
You being a gentleman won't
work in this business.

373
00:44:56,504 --> 00:44:58,472
Then what will work?
Bichhu's gang hooliganism?

374
00:45:01,776 --> 00:45:05,143
That's not true. We deal
with business like business.

375
00:45:05,513 --> 00:45:06,878
We never create fights for no reason.

376
00:45:12,520 --> 00:45:16,479
- They came to talk of marriage...
- Your brother is like that...

377
00:45:17,525 --> 00:45:20,494
- I'm scared of him.
- You dog! Cad!

378
00:45:20,695 --> 00:45:22,322
- Flirting in my area!
- Help!

379
00:45:22,530 --> 00:45:24,498
Teasing girls in our area!

380
00:45:26,534 --> 00:45:27,831
You rotten Eagle!

381
00:45:39,481 --> 00:45:41,949
Prakash! Let go!

382
00:45:44,152 --> 00:45:45,449
Leave him!

383
00:45:46,488 --> 00:45:48,456
That bastard Eagle was flirting
with one of our girls!

384
00:45:48,757 --> 00:45:50,122
Stop it! I don't
want to hear anything!

385
00:46:10,011 --> 00:46:11,740
Prakash has sent us.

386
00:46:12,514 --> 00:46:13,811
He apologizes.

387
00:46:16,518 --> 00:46:19,487
Why are you quiet?
You should apologize.

388
00:46:20,522 --> 00:46:22,490
You cut the noses of Bichhu
gang in front of the Eagles!

389
00:46:23,525 --> 00:46:25,993
Look, you are new here.

390
00:46:26,528 --> 00:46:28,086
You don't know the problems here.

391
00:46:29,464 --> 00:46:31,091
It's good he thrashed that Eagle.

392
00:46:31,466 --> 00:46:33,832
Had I been there, I'd
have castrated him!

393
00:46:37,872 --> 00:46:42,104
If anyone even looks at Max's
sister, Shirley, he blinds him!

394
00:46:43,478 --> 00:46:45,446
Is Shirley, Max' sister?

395
00:46:45,880 --> 00:46:47,939
Twin! She's his twin sister!

396
00:46:48,483 --> 00:46:51,111
How can we spare anyone who
takes a girl from our area out?

397
00:46:54,155 --> 00:46:56,783
We've come here because Prakash
is the leader of Bichhu gang.

398
00:46:57,492 --> 00:46:59,050
He's standing there.

399
00:47:03,498 --> 00:47:04,965
Go and meet him.

400
00:47:07,502 --> 00:47:09,129
He may be your boss.

401
00:47:09,504 --> 00:47:12,803
He's my brother. Don't
teach me what I must do!

402
00:47:16,511 --> 00:47:20,140
- She's coming!
- Butterfly, where are you going?

403
00:47:24,519 --> 00:47:27,488
My rain cloud. Shower on me!

404
00:47:30,458 --> 00:47:32,426
Spare me a glance...

405
00:47:36,197 --> 00:47:38,427
Rent of 1000 bucks
and zero deposit.

406
00:47:40,468 --> 00:47:42,436
A job can be done
without spending money.

407
00:47:46,875 --> 00:47:51,107
I give up, man! You're really
smart! Lafdu, take this.

408
00:47:56,484 --> 00:47:58,111
Do you forgive me?

409
00:47:58,486 --> 00:48:00,454
On one condition.

410
00:48:01,990 --> 00:48:06,950
Only if you give up fighting
and help me in setting my shop.

411
00:48:07,896 --> 00:48:10,456
Is that all? Then listen...

412
00:48:13,501 --> 00:48:14,866
You're with Rahul from today.

413
00:48:15,503 --> 00:48:18,131
- And you?
- I am with you.

414
00:48:18,506 --> 00:48:19,871
What guys?

415
00:48:23,511 --> 00:48:25,138
Will you do it or not?

416
00:48:29,517 --> 00:48:31,485
You've said it.
Assume it done.

417
00:48:56,945 --> 00:48:59,175
Having a fancy name won't
make the cakes sweeter?

418
00:49:32,513 --> 00:49:34,481
Look at that Bichhu entering
our area unflinchingly!

419
00:49:34,916 --> 00:49:36,884
Yes, Prakash's brother. Come on!

420
00:49:43,524 --> 00:49:47,324
You Bichhu's don't get
visa to come to our area.

421
00:49:47,528 --> 00:49:50,827
- Don't you know?
- Answer him!

422
00:49:52,533 --> 00:49:55,161
He forgot the answer and the road.

423
00:49:59,540 --> 00:50:02,236
I have to deliver this cake
there. Make way for me.

424
00:50:02,877 --> 00:50:08,509
Else what will you do? Beat us?
Show us some punch, fair villager!

425
00:50:09,550 --> 00:50:12,781
This Captain Cook can only show
examples of cake and pastries.

426
00:50:13,054 --> 00:50:17,252
The baboon! Just watch
how the coward will flee!

427
00:50:19,560 --> 00:50:21,289
Those who run away are cowards.

428
00:50:22,563 --> 00:50:24,531
But those fighting for no
reason are not valiant.

429
00:50:25,066 --> 00:50:26,397
They are fools.

430
00:50:30,505 --> 00:50:31,870
What man...?

431
00:50:33,508 --> 00:50:35,874
Do you have to deliver
the cake with your own hands?

432
00:50:38,913 --> 00:50:41,473
But if you don't have hands...?

433
00:50:43,518 --> 00:50:47,477
Now get out fast or your hands and
legs will be here and the body there.

434
00:50:48,523 --> 00:50:50,991
What border? I don't see any border.

435
00:50:51,526 --> 00:50:56,828
You'll see it. You will
see it before you go blind!

436
00:50:58,533 --> 00:51:01,502
What is this?
Sold just one biscuit all day?

437
00:51:03,538 --> 00:51:08,840
Keep this on your nose and draw a
borderline pushing it to the ground.

438
00:51:09,544 --> 00:51:10,909
There...

439
00:51:12,547 --> 00:51:15,516
Come on! You cookboy!

440
00:51:46,848 --> 00:51:49,476
I'd kept it for a beggar.

441
00:51:51,519 --> 00:51:52,884
You may each take 5 paise.

442
00:51:53,521 --> 00:51:54,818
You dog#$@!

443
00:51:58,926 --> 00:52:00,484
What a collar!

444
00:52:01,529 --> 00:52:03,497
Not a sign of dirt.

445
00:52:03,931 --> 00:52:05,489
Do you get an imported
washer man to wash it?

446
00:52:07,535 --> 00:52:09,162
What is going on?

447
00:52:10,538 --> 00:52:13,098
We were discussing laundering.

448
00:52:13,541 --> 00:52:15,839
Laundering shirts or him?

449
00:52:16,878 --> 00:52:18,175
What were they telling you?

450
00:52:20,548 --> 00:52:23,016
- Showing me the way.
- Then?

451
00:52:24,552 --> 00:52:27,020
The wrong path. I was going right.

452
00:52:30,158 --> 00:52:31,455
Get on with your work.

453
00:52:32,493 --> 00:52:34,188
Come with me.

454
00:52:35,496 --> 00:52:37,794
We were doing our work.
You came and spoilt matters.

455
00:52:38,499 --> 00:52:42,458
Come on guys.
What was the score?

456
00:52:54,515 --> 00:52:56,483
Do you like my new car?

457
00:52:56,918 --> 00:52:58,476
It's nice but look ahead and drive.

458
00:53:12,533 --> 00:53:13,898
Quiet...

459
00:53:18,539 --> 00:53:20,905
My bike is  new. Pinch me.

460
00:53:22,543 --> 00:53:24,909
- Get lost!
- Give you a shove?

461
00:53:26,881 --> 00:53:28,439
My car is new.

462
00:53:29,483 --> 00:53:31,280
Much faster than your bullock cart!

463
00:53:33,487 --> 00:53:34,852
Savio is throwing you a challenge.

464
00:53:36,891 --> 00:53:38,290
No, it's not fair.

465
00:53:38,492 --> 00:53:40,460
My bike, his jalopy.

466
00:53:41,495 --> 00:53:42,860
I'm a man and Savio...

467
00:53:50,504 --> 00:53:52,131
We'll have a race.

468
00:53:53,507 --> 00:53:55,975
Forget it. If you race
I'll get off here.

469
00:53:56,510 --> 00:53:57,875
It's a matter of my honor!

470
00:53:58,512 --> 00:53:59,911
...which I'm going to plunder.

471
00:54:30,478 --> 00:54:34,175
Don't you just love
to fool simple people?

472
00:54:35,483 --> 00:54:36,780
You too fool him.

473
00:54:37,485 --> 00:54:40,113
You love me but go out with him.

474
00:54:41,489 --> 00:54:42,956
Someday God will punish you!

475
00:54:43,824 --> 00:54:45,121
What happened?

476
00:54:46,494 --> 00:54:47,961
God turned into an ant and bit me!

477
00:54:51,499 --> 00:54:54,127
Come with me. Why are
you playing hard to get?

478
00:54:55,503 --> 00:54:57,198
To how many girls have you said this?

479
00:54:57,505 --> 00:54:58,870
Only you, Sandra.

480
00:55:04,512 --> 00:55:07,072
Only to you, Rose Anne, My love.

481
00:55:30,204 --> 00:55:32,434
I said, you are my Juliet

482
00:55:32,740 --> 00:55:35,436
And she said...
you're fibbing!

483
00:55:35,876 --> 00:55:40,108
Why does she think I'm lying
whenever I speak the truth?!

484
00:55:40,414 --> 00:55:45,852
That must be her style...
she must be consenting at heart

485
00:55:51,625 --> 00:55:55,789
She'll soon say she loves you...
why are you worried?

486
00:56:35,269 --> 00:56:39,433
I suggest, you invite her...
and treat her to lunch in a hotel

487
00:56:40,541 --> 00:56:44,944
Take her to the sea-shore
and just pop the question

488
00:56:45,646 --> 00:56:49,844
I did invite her...
and treated her to the sour-soup

489
00:56:50,785 --> 00:56:54,846
I found an opportunity and went
for it... I told her everything

490
00:56:55,723 --> 00:56:57,452
What did you tell her?

491
00:56:57,892 --> 00:57:02,852
I said, you're my Juliet. And she...
- She said you're lying

492
00:57:03,964 --> 00:57:08,264
Why does she think I'm lying
whenever I speak the truth?

493
00:57:09,136 --> 00:57:13,869
That must be her style...
She must be willing at heart

494
00:57:19,513 --> 00:57:23,779
She'll come around one of these
days... why are you worried?

495
00:58:05,493 --> 00:58:09,862
I've dealt with so many problems...
yours is different

496
00:58:10,498 --> 00:58:14,867
You're through with everything...
yet, where's the hitch?

497
00:58:18,806 --> 00:58:23,869
Elope with her...
if she knows what you want

498
00:58:24,011 --> 00:58:28,880
I went to elope with her
in the middle of the night

499
00:58:29,350 --> 00:58:30,977
Was that really set up?

500
00:59:12,059 --> 00:59:14,527
So that was your Eagle brother, Max.

501
00:59:15,563 --> 00:59:17,030
Quite a specimen.

502
00:59:17,565 --> 00:59:19,260
Did you like him?

503
00:59:19,967 --> 00:59:22,527
Why don't you join him for tea?

504
00:59:25,573 --> 00:59:28,064
Do you cycle to college daily?

505
00:59:28,842 --> 00:59:30,742
No, I go with Max on his bike.

506
00:59:32,513 --> 00:59:35,880
Why don't you come
with us, triple seat?

507
00:59:36,517 --> 00:59:38,815
Do you think I fear Max?

508
00:59:40,521 --> 00:59:42,318
Why should I fear him?

509
00:59:43,524 --> 00:59:44,821
Because he wears a leather jacket?

510
00:59:46,527 --> 00:59:47,824
And rings in his ears?

511
00:59:48,529 --> 00:59:50,827
Rides a bike and considers
himself the local thug?

512
00:59:51,532 --> 00:59:53,500
That's stupidity not bravery.

513
00:59:54,535 --> 00:59:56,503
Maybe he scares kids not me.

514
01:00:03,544 --> 01:00:05,239
What do you study?

515
01:00:11,552 --> 01:00:13,520
I've done a course
in Hotel Management.

516
01:00:17,558 --> 01:00:20,527
Why don't you come to my shop?
I make wonderful cakes.

517
01:00:38,846 --> 01:00:41,815
Why would I fear Maxi?
I am this and that...

518
01:00:42,516 --> 01:00:45,144
If you're so brave,
meet me in front of Maxi.

519
01:00:45,519 --> 01:00:47,487
All right. Want to bet?

520
01:00:50,190 --> 01:00:54,320
But if I win, you have to kiss me.

521
01:00:57,531 --> 01:00:59,499
If you have a face left.

522
01:05:04,845 --> 01:05:06,210
So I win!

523
01:05:08,515 --> 01:05:09,982
When will I get my prize?

524
01:05:11,852 --> 01:05:13,752
Will you help me shop?

525
01:05:17,524 --> 01:05:20,084
Give me two melons.

526
01:05:23,530 --> 01:05:26,897
I must admit, you were great that day.

527
01:05:27,534 --> 01:05:29,934
- You're very brave!
- I told you so.

528
01:05:30,137 --> 01:05:32,435
- I'm not scared of Max.
- But I was scared.

529
01:05:32,873 --> 01:05:36,104
When Max looked at you,
for a second, I...

530
01:05:36,810 --> 01:05:38,107
I was really scared!

531
01:05:39,479 --> 01:05:41,447
- For me?
- Are you okay?

532
01:05:42,482 --> 01:05:43,949
Scared for me?

533
01:05:45,485 --> 01:05:48,852
I don't know why...
I never felt like this before.

534
01:05:49,489 --> 01:05:50,786
What did you feel?
 
535
01:05:56,496 --> 01:05:59,954
I have to make fruit salad today.

536
01:06:02,502 --> 01:06:04,868
You said you never
felt like this before.

537
01:06:05,505 --> 01:06:09,134
- What did you feel?
- Yes, that's it.

538
01:06:10,510 --> 01:06:14,879
Possibly... I felt...

539
01:06:16,516 --> 01:06:17,813
As if...

540
01:06:19,519 --> 01:06:20,884
As if...?

541
01:06:28,462 --> 01:06:30,020
We're home.

542
01:06:31,965 --> 01:06:33,432
And my prize?

543
01:06:33,800 --> 01:06:36,098
Won't you come in?

544
01:06:38,472 --> 01:06:39,769
Maxi is not home.

545
01:06:45,979 --> 01:06:47,446
What a beautiful house!

546
01:06:53,487 --> 01:06:57,446
Now I'll give you your prize.

547
01:06:58,492 --> 01:07:01,723
Now it's not just the prize.
Much more than that.

548
01:07:03,497 --> 01:07:06,466
This is proof that you love me.

549
01:07:23,517 --> 01:07:25,144
That's the prize for cheaters!

550
01:07:27,521 --> 01:07:29,751
Anyone can wear a mask and win a bet.

551
01:07:30,457 --> 01:07:31,924
Sorry, you lose.

552
01:07:35,462 --> 01:07:37,259
Thanks for carrying
so many fruits for me.

553
01:07:41,468 --> 01:07:43,026
Where are you going?

554
01:07:46,473 --> 01:07:49,442
Maxi will soon be home.
Looks like you want to get beaten!

555
01:07:50,477 --> 01:07:53,776
- No, I want to feed him.
- What?

556
01:07:56,883 --> 01:08:00,114
He'll make a fruit salad
out of you, Romeo!

557
01:08:00,487 --> 01:08:03,183
- And you'll enjoy it.
- Sure.

558
01:08:03,890 --> 01:08:05,448
So enjoy it. Do you have lime?

559
01:08:06,493 --> 01:08:08,461
No but we have a
first aid box. Want it?

560
01:08:12,899 --> 01:08:16,062
You'll know when he breaks your bones.

561
01:08:16,503 --> 01:08:19,802
- Then don't tell me.
- I won't.

562
01:08:40,527 --> 01:08:42,495
I say... Maxi is here...

563
01:09:27,574 --> 01:09:29,474
- What?
- What...?

564
01:09:31,011 --> 01:09:33,479
What, what? My bike...

565
01:09:36,516 --> 01:09:37,983
I just got it painted.

566
01:09:45,525 --> 01:09:47,152
Looks like such a beauty!

567
01:09:47,527 --> 01:09:49,757
I'll take you for a ride. Let's go.

568
01:09:50,530 --> 01:09:52,498
- Not now...
- Why not? Come on.

569
01:09:52,933 --> 01:09:54,491
- I have lots of work.
- Forget it, come on!

570
01:09:54,701 --> 01:09:56,896
- I don't want to come!
- Don't want to come?

571
01:10:05,545 --> 01:10:07,012
Don't take it to heart.

572
01:10:13,553 --> 01:10:15,180
I'll come with you tomorrow.

573
01:10:19,559 --> 01:10:22,357
I made it, specially for you.

574
01:10:23,563 --> 01:10:25,258
Like it?

575
01:10:33,506 --> 01:10:34,803
What was that sound?

576
01:10:35,175 --> 01:10:36,802
Sound...? No.

577
01:10:37,010 --> 01:10:38,477
There was. Where...?

578
01:10:38,845 --> 01:10:40,142
Outside...

579
01:10:42,515 --> 01:10:43,982
No, in here.

580
01:11:05,538 --> 01:11:07,506
Who locked you in? Shirley?

581
01:11:11,544 --> 01:11:14,012
You don't want to come?
I'll take Maggie.

582
01:11:44,511 --> 01:11:47,480
It will be great fun
when Max returns!

583
01:12:07,534 --> 01:12:09,092
The pastry is no good today.

584
01:12:10,537 --> 01:12:12,903
Then go to the shop in front!
Why do you come here?

585
01:12:13,873 --> 01:12:15,170
Where is aunt?

586
01:12:15,542 --> 01:12:17,339
Go to Treat House.

587
01:12:19,546 --> 01:12:22,174
Hurry up! We have a big contract.

588
01:12:22,882 --> 01:12:25,180
Henceforth this contract
will always come to us.

589
01:12:27,554 --> 01:12:30,785
He takes away my contract
and then gloats over it!

590
01:12:31,491 --> 01:12:33,459
- What's the matter?
- I know everything!

591
01:12:33,827 --> 01:12:35,454
This is that rascal
Prakash' trick!

592
01:12:35,895 --> 01:12:38,455
He grabbed the Goa Liberation
Day contract under threats.

593
01:12:39,499 --> 01:12:42,059
But one mustn't use force.

594
01:12:43,503 --> 01:12:47,462
You just tell me, I'll break the
cad's legs and hang them in your shop!

595
01:12:47,907 --> 01:12:50,967
What will I do with his leg?
I want the contract!

596
01:12:51,511 --> 01:12:53,479
I'm a God fearing man.

597
01:13:13,533 --> 01:13:15,501
Shall I get my tempo tomorrow?

598
01:13:16,536 --> 01:13:18,333
No, Mr. Mascarenhas will
collect his order personally.

599
01:13:18,538 --> 01:13:19,835
Need anything else?

600
01:13:20,540 --> 01:13:22,235
Nothing. Carry on.

601
01:13:48,501 --> 01:13:51,129
I want to place a special order.

602
01:14:00,013 --> 01:14:01,878
It should have 7 colors.

603
01:14:03,516 --> 01:14:06,485
Red, blue, pink.

604
01:14:07,520 --> 01:14:10,489
Green, black and white.

605
01:14:12,525 --> 01:14:14,891
There should be no yellow.

606
01:14:15,261 --> 01:14:16,489
There should be no yellow.

607
01:14:29,476 --> 01:14:30,773
...should be there.

608
01:14:31,478 --> 01:14:33,105
Should be there.

609
01:14:36,483 --> 01:14:38,280
Write on that...

610
01:14:46,493 --> 01:14:47,858
And keep in mind...

611
01:15:06,513 --> 01:15:09,482
Have we stopped
accepting advance?

612
01:15:09,916 --> 01:15:13,750
One has to adjust
depending on the customer.

613
01:15:14,521 --> 01:15:15,988
Come on, we have enough work.

614
01:15:20,527 --> 01:15:22,222
8 o'clock tomorrow.

615
01:15:49,489 --> 01:15:51,457
I hope the chloroform wasn't too much.

616
01:15:51,824 --> 01:15:53,451
Or they'll sleep till morning.

617
01:15:56,496 --> 01:15:57,963
This is the job of an expert.

618
01:16:55,822 --> 01:16:57,119
But why did you change the name?

619
01:17:08,501 --> 01:17:09,798
Come in, sir.

620
01:18:25,511 --> 01:18:27,138
Please listen tome.

621
01:18:27,513 --> 01:18:28,810
What a tiny shop!

622
01:18:30,516 --> 01:18:31,983
Full of rats!

623
01:18:32,518 --> 01:18:36,147
- You cheated me!
- Sir, listen to me.

624
01:18:36,522 --> 01:18:39,082
- What to listen?
- I'll do something. -What?

625
01:18:39,192 --> 01:18:40,489
What's wrong?

626
01:18:43,029 --> 01:18:45,497
I'll lose my job thanks to this idiot!

627
01:18:46,866 --> 01:18:48,163
What was the order?

628
01:18:52,538 --> 01:18:55,336
I'll give it to you.
Take them from my shop.

629
01:19:06,552 --> 01:19:08,918
You saved my job.

630
01:19:09,555 --> 01:19:11,853
I'll pay you 20/. Extra.

631
01:19:13,559 --> 01:19:15,254
Rats running all over the place!

632
01:19:40,019 --> 01:19:42,988
I don't understand how
so many rats got in.

633
01:19:43,523 --> 01:19:45,821
- Maybe a window was open.
- Which window?

634
01:19:46,526 --> 01:19:47,993
I don't know.

635
01:19:49,529 --> 01:19:51,497
Did anyone come to the shop?

636
01:19:53,533 --> 01:19:56,502
- No.
- You are very innocent.

637
01:19:57,537 --> 01:19:59,334
I know it's those Catholics at fault!

638
01:19:59,539 --> 01:20:01,507
You blame the Eagle
gang for everything!

639
01:20:02,542 --> 01:20:04,339
Can't a rat get in by chance?

640
01:20:04,877 --> 01:20:08,506
And by chance Pascal had a thousand
sandwiches and pastries ready that day

641
01:20:09,549 --> 01:20:13,508
Should I ready Francis' order?
I'd asked you to get 4 dozen breads.

642
01:20:15,555 --> 01:20:17,523
I'll get it. Come on.

643
01:20:31,504 --> 01:20:33,267
Another order?

644
01:20:34,507 --> 01:20:37,806
- How much for the first order?
- Only 200 rupees.

645
01:20:43,182 --> 01:20:44,479
The cake was very good.

646
01:20:59,532 --> 01:21:01,295
You're forgetting something.

647
01:21:22,555 --> 01:21:24,523
Do something. It makes such a racket.

648
01:21:24,957 --> 01:21:27,357
When I go to pick her up,
the old man comes down before her.

649
01:21:28,494 --> 01:21:29,961
The old man is her father.

650
01:21:30,162 --> 01:21:31,459
The silencer is worn out.

651
01:21:32,498 --> 01:21:34,295
Put in a new one. It's urgent.

652
01:21:34,901 --> 01:21:36,960
We don't have it. You'll
only get it there, in Hell.

653
01:21:37,503 --> 01:21:38,800
Hell... what do you mean?

654
01:21:39,505 --> 01:21:42,201
In their area. Who will go there?

655
01:21:45,011 --> 01:21:46,808
I'll go. Tonight.

656
01:21:58,524 --> 01:22:01,493
- Come on.
- I won't come in.

657
01:22:03,529 --> 01:22:05,997
Sit near the bikes.
Michael, come on.

658
01:22:23,549 --> 01:22:25,847
Look at this. Will it fit?

659
01:22:26,052 --> 01:22:27,781
Put it on the bike.
I'll find another.

660
01:22:59,518 --> 01:23:01,213
Setting rats out?

661
01:23:02,521 --> 01:23:05,081
Let's beat this louse into a rat! 

662
01:23:10,529 --> 01:23:12,156
Catch him!

663
01:24:32,144 --> 01:24:33,441
Fight by yourself
if you have the guts

664
01:24:40,486 --> 01:24:42,784
Brought his complete rural gang!

665
01:24:43,489 --> 01:24:44,854
And asks me to fight alone.

666
01:24:46,492 --> 01:24:49,461
Know what? He ruined my bike.

667
01:24:51,497 --> 01:24:53,863
But who will save his shop?

668
01:24:54,500 --> 01:24:55,967
I'll save his shop!

669
01:26:08,507 --> 01:26:12,466
Come on! Prakash and
Maxi are having a brawl!

670
01:26:55,487 --> 01:26:56,954
Kill him!

671
01:27:06,498 --> 01:27:07,863
Prakash! Stop!

672
01:27:08,500 --> 01:27:10,468
Stop them! This is madness!

673
01:27:10,836 --> 01:27:13,505
- They'll kill each other!
- This is a man's game.

674
01:27:13,505 --> 01:27:15,063
You get the hell out of here.

675
01:27:16,508 --> 01:27:17,873
Hit him, Prakash!

676
01:28:00,486 --> 01:28:02,113
Let go of my brother!

677
01:28:33,018 --> 01:28:34,485
Let go of him, Maxi!

678
01:28:35,521 --> 01:28:37,489
He will die!

679
01:29:27,573 --> 01:29:28,972
Are you all right?

680
01:29:32,511 --> 01:29:36,140
What happened to you? Why did you
have to intervene in the fight?

681
01:29:36,515 --> 01:29:40,474
- I was frightened.
- Why? You've seen fights earlier. 

682
01:29:41,520 --> 01:29:43,317
What if you'd been hurt?

683
01:29:44,023 --> 01:29:47,151
What would happen to me? Yes?

684
01:29:47,526 --> 01:29:49,289
And if he'd died?

685
01:29:49,528 --> 01:29:50,825
Who? That cook?

686
01:29:51,530 --> 01:29:54,090
There'd be one Bichhu less.

687
01:29:58,537 --> 01:30:00,505
Nothing will happen to me.

688
01:30:01,540 --> 01:30:03,007
But the funeral of
two guys is definite.

689
01:30:03,542 --> 01:30:06,773
That rascal Prakash
and his brother, Rahul.

690
01:30:11,550 --> 01:30:13,518
I'll always be with you.

691
01:30:14,553 --> 01:30:16,180
To look after you.

692
01:30:17,556 --> 01:30:18,921
Nothing will happen.

693
01:30:20,559 --> 01:30:22,288
Nothing will happen, Maxi?
