1
00:00:18,101 --> 00:00:21,730
<i># Summer magic</i>

2
00:00:22,605 --> 00:00:27,338
<i># That wonderful magic</i>

3
00:02:52,055 --> 00:02:55,821
- Who's it from?
- Oh, nobody you'd know.

4
00:03:27,357 --> 00:03:30,554
Gilly, pry yourself away
from that piano. There's work to do.

5
00:03:30,626 --> 00:03:33,060
I don't see why Mother had to sell it.

6
00:03:33,129 --> 00:03:36,724
Because it's the most valuable thing
we own and we need the money.

7
00:03:36,799 --> 00:03:40,394
How am I going to be a composer
with only a guitar to compose on?

8
00:03:42,038 --> 00:03:44,131
Hey! My fish!

9
00:03:45,341 --> 00:03:48,504
I got to thinking about him
the other day. Where was he?

10
00:03:48,578 --> 00:03:51,172
Oh, Gilly, you can't take everything.

11
00:03:51,247 --> 00:03:54,011
There's not gonna be room
in our horrid new house.

12
00:03:54,083 --> 00:03:56,813
And we can't afford
to pay storage on junk.

13
00:03:56,886 --> 00:04:00,049
Look at his poor eye.

14
00:04:00,123 --> 00:04:05,151
Why is my stuff always junk
and your stuff always priceless?

15
00:04:05,228 --> 00:04:09,255
- Here, you can have him, Peter.
- Thanks! I'll put him with my junk.

16
00:04:09,332 --> 00:04:11,766
Well, that did a lot of good.

17
00:04:11,834 --> 00:04:13,392
Their poor mother.

18
00:04:13,469 --> 00:04:17,599
One minute a happy wife,
and then the fates strike a cruel blow

19
00:04:17,673 --> 00:04:21,165
and she's changed
to a poor widow woman.

20
00:04:22,278 --> 00:04:25,645
- Watch the teacup, miss.
- Yes, ma'am.

21
00:04:25,715 --> 00:04:29,378
This family is going to be lost
without you, Mary.

22
00:04:29,452 --> 00:04:32,285
You too, Ellen.

23
00:04:37,994 --> 00:04:43,398
In a book I was reading,
<i>True Blue</i> was the name of it, <i>True Blue,</i>

24
00:04:43,466 --> 00:04:47,334
they had this family, Lord and Lady
Darcy, and their beloved children.

25
00:04:47,403 --> 00:04:51,772
- They lived in a magnificent castle.
- Aye, I do love them castle stories!

26
00:04:51,841 --> 00:04:54,935
- The tray, Miss.
- Yes, ma'am.

27
00:04:55,011 --> 00:04:58,606
Well, everybody worshipped everybody,

28
00:04:58,681 --> 00:05:02,139
so of course it was all terribly happy.

29
00:05:03,486 --> 00:05:07,183
Then one day they lost all their riches.

30
00:05:07,256 --> 00:05:09,247
Lord save us.

31
00:05:09,926 --> 00:05:13,953
And they were driven from the castle
and they were forced to live in a hovel.

32
00:05:14,030 --> 00:05:17,261
It was not in a nice neighborhood.

33
00:05:17,333 --> 00:05:21,599
But they had this loyal old
family servant,

34
00:05:21,671 --> 00:05:26,267
and the faithful creature
followed them from castle to hovel.

35
00:05:26,342 --> 00:05:28,970
And she not only brought
her own life savings,

36
00:05:29,045 --> 00:05:31,138
wrapped in a pitiful handkerchief,

37
00:05:31,214 --> 00:05:33,444
to her beloved mistress,

38
00:05:33,516 --> 00:05:39,284
but she remained with them
to serve them for years without wages.

39
00:05:39,355 --> 00:05:43,587
'Tis a beautiful tale.
And a lesson to the greedy.

40
00:05:43,659 --> 00:05:46,822
It is that. And you, Miss Nancy,

41
00:05:46,896 --> 00:05:50,332
being all so interested
in the welfare of the deserving,

42
00:05:50,399 --> 00:05:52,526
will be happy to know
that Ellen and myself

43
00:05:52,602 --> 00:05:55,127
have found a nice situation in Salem.

44
00:05:55,204 --> 00:05:57,297
At five dollars more a month.

45
00:05:57,373 --> 00:06:01,207
Oh. I'm happy for you both.

46
00:06:01,277 --> 00:06:03,040
Really.

47
00:06:07,416 --> 00:06:10,647
- Finish the story, Nancy.
- I reached the end.

48
00:06:10,720 --> 00:06:14,212
- End is right.
- Miss Nancy!

49
00:06:14,290 --> 00:06:17,123
'Tis the men come for the piano.

50
00:06:19,562 --> 00:06:21,689
Oh, Gilly.

51
00:06:31,474 --> 00:06:33,465
Is this the instrument?

52
00:06:36,245 --> 00:06:37,644
Pad.

53
00:06:38,714 --> 00:06:40,545
Son. Pad.

54
00:06:48,190 --> 00:06:50,055
Strap.

55
00:06:55,765 --> 00:06:58,256
Mallet.

56
00:07:03,873 --> 00:07:06,341
Dolly.

57
00:07:06,409 --> 00:07:09,970
- Careful!
- It's just saying goodbye, Gilly.

58
00:07:29,131 --> 00:07:32,726
Oh, 'tis a black day for the Careys.

59
00:07:32,802 --> 00:07:36,135
- Back to your packing, miss.
- Yes, ma'am.

60
00:07:37,673 --> 00:07:42,667
We've lost a friend, Gilly.
Sold for a mess of pottage.

61
00:07:42,745 --> 00:07:46,738
Nancy, can't you ever keep quiet?

62
00:07:46,816 --> 00:07:50,684
- Do you always have to make...
- Nancy! Gilly! Come quick!

63
00:07:50,753 --> 00:07:53,813
- They got a thing! Come quick!
- A what?

64
00:07:54,590 --> 00:07:58,583
A thing! Here she comes! Here she comes!

65
00:07:58,661 --> 00:08:01,653
Oh, my! Look at that! Ooh!

66
00:08:06,302 --> 00:08:09,829
- It's a player piano!
- Oh, I've heard one of them.

67
00:08:09,905 --> 00:08:12,465
You don't need no hands.

68
00:08:12,541 --> 00:08:14,532
Son.

69
00:08:22,918 --> 00:08:25,182
Put it right there.

70
00:08:28,424 --> 00:08:32,190
Suppose there's some horrible mistake.
Are you sure it's for us?

71
00:08:32,261 --> 00:08:36,322
A Mrs. Carey sold
the instrument we just removed

72
00:08:36,399 --> 00:08:39,129
for $150 cash and a swap.

73
00:08:39,902 --> 00:08:41,699
This instrument is the swap.

74
00:08:43,406 --> 00:08:45,397
Rolls in here.

75
00:08:46,375 --> 00:08:50,505
Here's one we always put on
when folks are moving.

76
00:09:02,725 --> 00:09:05,091
Son.

77
00:09:07,430 --> 00:09:10,490
- Let me play! Let me play!
- When you learn how.

78
00:09:19,909 --> 00:09:22,309
Slow it down!

79
00:09:29,585 --> 00:09:31,143
Here come the words now.

80
00:09:31,220 --> 00:09:33,950
<i> # It's time for flittering</i>

81
00:09:34,023 --> 00:09:37,356
<i># Dusting off the trunk</i>
<i>and flittering far</i>

82
00:09:37,426 --> 00:09:39,121
<i># Where the grass is greener</i>

83
00:09:39,195 --> 00:09:44,326
<i># Now and then comes the time again</i>
<i>for flittering</i>

84
00:09:44,400 --> 00:09:47,267
<i># We'll soon be packing up</i>

85
00:09:47,336 --> 00:09:52,433
<i># Stacking up our dreams and bric-a-brac</i>
<i>for some new destination</i>

86
00:09:52,508 --> 00:09:55,568
<i># Don't know where but we're going there</i>

87
00:09:55,644 --> 00:09:58,204
<i># We're flittering again</i>

88
00:09:59,381 --> 00:10:02,782
<i># New places, new faces</i>

89
00:10:02,852 --> 00:10:05,047
<i># New friendships will start</i>

90
00:10:05,121 --> 00:10:09,717
<i># While old places, old faces</i>

91
00:10:09,792 --> 00:10:11,453
<i># Stay dear to our heart</i>

92
00:10:11,527 --> 00:10:15,987
<i># As we go flittering,</i>
<i>following a rainbow</i>

93
00:10:16,065 --> 00:10:19,228
<i># Flittering bright over the horizon</i>

94
00:10:19,301 --> 00:10:21,792
<i># Maybe then and maybe there</i>

95
00:10:21,871 --> 00:10:25,432
<i># We'll settle down and never care</i>

96
00:10:25,508 --> 00:10:31,174
<i># For flittering, flittering,</i>
<i>flittering, again #</i>

97
00:10:31,247 --> 00:10:33,181
- Mother!
- Hello, sweetheart.

98
00:10:33,249 --> 00:10:36,116
- Feel better now?
- You bet. Sure glad you made the swap.

99
00:10:36,185 --> 00:10:39,780
- Oh, it's wonderful, Mother!
- Let me tell her! Let me tell her!

100
00:10:39,855 --> 00:10:41,288
Tell me.

101
00:10:41,357 --> 00:10:44,884
Well, this one you don't need any hands!
You play with feet!

102
00:10:44,960 --> 00:10:49,158
There's little rolls in with holes
that make the keys go up and down.

103
00:10:49,231 --> 00:10:51,392
- No!
- And guess what.

104
00:10:51,467 --> 00:10:54,732
- What?
- I played. I played with this leg.

105
00:10:54,804 --> 00:10:56,795
Nobody showed me how.

106
00:10:57,740 --> 00:10:59,731
That's your smartest leg.

107
00:11:03,445 --> 00:11:06,312
- You have almost everything done.
- Mm-hm.

108
00:11:07,650 --> 00:11:10,619
Children, come over here.

109
00:11:13,522 --> 00:11:17,458
- I've just come from the lawyers.
- Oh, what happened, Mother?

110
00:11:17,526 --> 00:11:21,223
Oh, it's nothing that can't be solved.

111
00:11:21,297 --> 00:11:23,162
We'll make out somehow.

112
00:11:23,232 --> 00:11:27,498
It's just that I've learned we haven't
quite as much money as I thought we had.

113
00:11:27,570 --> 00:11:29,265
Go on, Mother.

114
00:11:30,840 --> 00:11:33,638
The real blow was those mining stocks
we'd counted on,

115
00:11:33,709 --> 00:11:36,143
the ones George Ferguson
got your father to buy.

116
00:11:36,212 --> 00:11:40,945
They're worthless. Not worth the paper
they're written on, Mr. Manson told me.

117
00:11:41,016 --> 00:11:43,576
Oh, well, that isn't so bad.

118
00:11:43,652 --> 00:11:46,553
We're just in reduced circumstances.

119
00:11:46,622 --> 00:11:49,022
I'll be very happy to beg.

120
00:11:49,091 --> 00:11:52,788
I saw a beggar once
and he had a tin cup full of money.

121
00:11:52,862 --> 00:11:55,695
Things won't be so very different.

122
00:11:55,764 --> 00:11:57,959
I'm afraid they will in a way.

123
00:11:58,033 --> 00:12:02,094
You see, counting everything,
we have exactly $50 a month to live on,

124
00:12:02,171 --> 00:12:06,403
so we can't even afford to move
to the little house we were going to.

125
00:12:06,475 --> 00:12:10,411
We can't afford
that horrible little house?

126
00:12:10,479 --> 00:12:13,175
Oh, Mother, that's wonderful!

127
00:12:13,249 --> 00:12:16,878
Oh, Gilly!

128
00:12:16,952 --> 00:12:18,613
What ails her?

129
00:12:18,687 --> 00:12:21,986
- Mother, this came today. This.
- What is it?

130
00:12:22,057 --> 00:12:25,515
Mother, you remember after father...

131
00:12:25,594 --> 00:12:28,927
That evening when we all tried
to make ourselves feel better

132
00:12:28,998 --> 00:12:31,159
by talking about things
that had been fun,

133
00:12:31,233 --> 00:12:34,430
and the best thing we thought of
was that time in Maine.

134
00:12:34,503 --> 00:12:37,199
- And we saw the yellow house in Beulah.
- Yes!

135
00:12:37,273 --> 00:12:40,572
And we peered in through the windows,
and wasn't it beautiful?

136
00:12:40,643 --> 00:12:43,578
- And nobody lived there.
- Hey, that was years ago.

137
00:12:43,646 --> 00:12:46,137
- You're wild.
- I remember it.

138
00:12:46,215 --> 00:12:49,241
- You weren't even born.
- Oh, stop interrupting.

139
00:12:49,318 --> 00:12:52,651
- Your entire lives are about to change.
- Go on, Nancy.

140
00:12:52,721 --> 00:12:54,450
Well, Mother, a couple of weeks ago,

141
00:12:54,523 --> 00:12:57,754
I decided that I'd try to find out
about that house.

142
00:12:57,826 --> 00:13:01,091
So I wrote to the postmaster in Beulah,
and he answered.

143
00:13:01,163 --> 00:13:04,462
His name is Ossian Popham.
Isn't it a beautiful name?

144
00:13:04,533 --> 00:13:08,162
Anyway, he's the agent for Mr. Hamilton,
who owns the house,

145
00:13:08,237 --> 00:13:10,398
who's miles away in China or somewhere.

146
00:13:10,472 --> 00:13:13,771
Probably an old missionary
or remittance man in disgrace or...

147
00:13:13,842 --> 00:13:17,107
- Could I see Mr. Popham's letter?
- It's all right, Mother. I...

148
00:13:17,179 --> 00:13:19,443
- Nancy...
- Well...

149
00:13:21,784 --> 00:13:24,912
"The pitiful plight of your good self
and your little ones..."

150
00:13:24,987 --> 00:13:27,717
Oh, Mother, read the last page.

151
00:13:27,790 --> 00:13:32,227
"Beulah is brimming over
with fresh milk for your baby boy..."

152
00:13:32,294 --> 00:13:33,727
Who's a baby?

153
00:13:33,796 --> 00:13:37,664
"...so there's no need for him
to be blue with rickets." Nancy!

154
00:13:37,733 --> 00:13:40,167
The important part's
on the last page. Look.

155
00:13:40,235 --> 00:13:42,465
It says the yellow house is vacant

156
00:13:42,538 --> 00:13:46,998
and Mr. Hamilton would be glad to rent
it to a deserving family like ours

157
00:13:47,076 --> 00:13:49,567
for a mere $60 a year.

158
00:13:49,645 --> 00:13:53,672
And he has the right to decide,
'cause he's not only the postmaster,

159
00:13:53,749 --> 00:13:57,446
but Mr. Hamilton's trusted friend,
his factotum, power attorney.

160
00:13:57,519 --> 00:14:00,454
- Slow down, Nancy.
- Oh, think of living in the country.

161
00:14:00,522 --> 00:14:04,424
No storage bills. All our things
will fit into the yellow house.

162
00:14:04,493 --> 00:14:08,054
We'll be self-supporting.
Chickens. Fresh eggs.

163
00:14:08,130 --> 00:14:11,725
Vegetables from the garden. Air. Space.

164
00:14:11,800 --> 00:14:13,791
Honest toil!

165
00:14:16,472 --> 00:14:19,532
- Can we, Mother? Can we?
- Oh, please, Mother.

166
00:14:19,742 --> 00:14:23,041
But, Mother,
my school's here and my friends.

167
00:14:24,680 --> 00:14:28,309
- Beulah's a hick town.
- Abraham Lincoln came from a hick town.

168
00:14:30,052 --> 00:14:32,145
Mother?

169
00:14:32,221 --> 00:14:36,123
Your father loved you so,
and he wanted so much for you.

170
00:14:36,191 --> 00:14:38,386
It was his dream to live in the country.

171
00:14:38,460 --> 00:14:43,329
So maybe he'd like to know we were
together in the yellow house in Beulah.

172
00:14:43,399 --> 00:14:47,859
Oh, Mother, I knew it, I knew it!
I wished it!

173
00:14:47,936 --> 00:14:52,202
Gilly, get to the piano.
Mother, sit down there.

174
00:14:52,274 --> 00:14:57,735
There. In anticipation of this glorious
decisión, I've written a glorification.

175
00:14:57,813 --> 00:15:00,543
But first, an introduction
straight from the Bible.

176
00:15:00,616 --> 00:15:03,016
Church chords, please, Gilly.

177
00:15:04,586 --> 00:15:07,146
Thou shalt no more be termed forsaken,

178
00:15:07,222 --> 00:15:11,056
neither shall thy land
any more be termed desolate,

179
00:15:11,126 --> 00:15:12,889
but it shall be called Beulah,

180
00:15:12,961 --> 00:15:15,725
for the Lord delighteth in thee. Amen.

181
00:15:15,798 --> 00:15:17,993
Right. Now, <i>Railroad Rag.</i>

182
00:15:18,067 --> 00:15:20,467
- What?
- You were just playing it.

183
00:15:25,407 --> 00:15:29,503
<i># Land of promise, bounteous</i>

184
00:15:30,179 --> 00:15:33,273
<i># This is beautiful,</i>
<i>this is beautiful Beulah</i>

185
00:15:33,348 --> 00:15:37,079
- <i># In the rocky state of Maine</i>
- <i># Land of plenty</i>

186
00:15:37,152 --> 00:15:39,313
<i># Meant for us</i>

187
00:15:39,388 --> 00:15:42,687
<i># This is beautiful,</i>
<i>this is beautiful Beulah</i>

188
00:15:44,493 --> 00:15:46,518
<i># Within our reach is there</i>

189
00:15:46,595 --> 00:15:48,756
<i># Grapes big as peaches there</i>

190
00:15:48,831 --> 00:15:50,890
<i># The cows and bees are busy</i>

191
00:15:50,966 --> 00:15:54,231
<i># Who needs any money</i>
<i>in the land of milk and honey?</i>

192
00:15:54,303 --> 00:15:58,103
<i># Sweet apple trees abound,</i>
<i>wild cherries all around</i>

193
00:15:58,173 --> 00:16:00,403
<i># Berries on the vine,</i>

194
00:16:00,476 --> 00:16:02,706
<i># They're so nice, it's a paradise</i>

195
00:16:02,778 --> 00:16:06,976
<i># Beulah land, so beautiful</i>

196
00:16:07,049 --> 00:16:09,916

197
00:16:09,985 --> 00:16:12,010
<i># Chug-a-choo, chug-a-choo</i>

198
00:16:12,087 --> 00:16:16,524
<i># To beautiful Beulah land,</i>
<i>beautiful Beulah, Maine</i>

199
00:16:16,592 --> 00:16:21,757
<i># To beautiful Beulah land,</i>
<i>beautiful Beulah, Maine #</i>

200
00:16:21,830 --> 00:16:24,594
Choo-chug-a-choo, chug-a-choo,
whoo-whoo!

201
00:16:51,360 --> 00:16:54,124
So this is Beulah.

202
00:16:54,196 --> 00:16:56,721
Yeah, you're right
in the heart of the city now.

203
00:16:56,798 --> 00:17:00,029
The town, the whole thing, is wonderful.

204
00:17:00,102 --> 00:17:02,935
How can we thank your father
for all he's done for us?

205
00:17:03,005 --> 00:17:07,465
The name Ossian Popham should flame
across the sky with letters of fire.

206
00:17:07,543 --> 00:17:11,946
Pa's just glad somebody's
gonna be living in the old yellow house.

207
00:17:12,748 --> 00:17:16,309
The Hamilton's haven't used it
since uh... I can recollect.

208
00:17:16,385 --> 00:17:18,512
What's the matter with it? Haunted?

209
00:17:18,587 --> 00:17:22,250
No. Pa says it's just too fancy
for these parts.

210
00:17:22,324 --> 00:17:25,293
The way the Hamiltons
fixed up the barn for dancing,

211
00:17:25,360 --> 00:17:27,988
Pa says it'd darn near overpower a cow.

212
00:17:29,164 --> 00:17:32,133
Your father didn't write much
about his family.

213
00:17:32,201 --> 00:17:33,862
Are you an only child, Digby?

214
00:17:34,636 --> 00:17:37,764
Well, you might say so, ma'am.
I just have a sister.

215
00:17:40,409 --> 00:17:42,707
Mother, look. The church.

216
00:17:42,778 --> 00:17:45,144
How lovely and quaint.

217
00:17:45,214 --> 00:17:47,079
Heavenly.

218
00:17:47,883 --> 00:17:51,182
Yeah, and uh... believe it or not,

219
00:17:51,253 --> 00:17:54,916
we have a minister named uh... Mr. Lord.

220
00:17:55,824 --> 00:17:58,918
- Is he any relation to...
- No, Peter.

221
00:18:00,929 --> 00:18:03,454
Well, hold tight.

222
00:18:14,276 --> 00:18:17,040
Country! Real country!

223
00:18:17,112 --> 00:18:20,047
- We're out in the sticks, all right.
- Gilly.

224
00:18:20,115 --> 00:18:22,913
Sticks?! It's the loveliest!

225
00:18:22,985 --> 00:18:25,715
Land of promise. Land of opportunity.

226
00:18:26,388 --> 00:18:28,356
Opportunity for what?

227
00:18:29,224 --> 00:18:31,055
Well, you've got something there.

228
00:18:31,126 --> 00:18:35,119
You're the first family to move
into Beulah in more than five years.

229
00:18:35,197 --> 00:18:37,961
Most people move away to the city.

230
00:18:38,800 --> 00:18:41,667
That's where I'm aiming to get
just as soon as I can.

231
00:18:41,737 --> 00:18:44,365
See some of them bright lights.
Make a little money.

232
00:18:44,439 --> 00:18:48,432
Money? The heavenly thing about
the country is you don't need money.

233
00:18:50,145 --> 00:18:52,204
You have the soil! The soil!

234
00:18:53,181 --> 00:18:56,150
- What's soil?
- Mud.

235
00:19:57,646 --> 00:20:00,308
We're here! We're home!

236
00:20:00,382 --> 00:20:02,350
Oh, Gilly, come on!

237
00:20:06,321 --> 00:20:08,312
The piano's here!

238
00:20:18,400 --> 00:20:20,391
Mother! A quaint old pump!

239
00:20:32,547 --> 00:20:36,176
You folks the Careys?
I heard you way up in the attic.

240
00:20:36,251 --> 00:20:37,946
Yes.

241
00:20:38,019 --> 00:20:41,147
You mean to tell me
that you're the Careys?

242
00:20:43,725 --> 00:20:47,661
- You must be Ossian Popham.
- Yes.

243
00:20:47,729 --> 00:20:51,995
- At your service, ma'am.
- First dibs for bedrooms, Gilly!

244
00:20:52,067 --> 00:20:53,830
Nancy!

245
00:20:57,305 --> 00:20:59,705
Is this your treasured daughter, ma'am?

246
00:21:01,710 --> 00:21:04,235
Well, let's just say my daughter.

247
00:21:04,312 --> 00:21:07,577
Nancy, this is Mr. Popham.

248
00:21:08,650 --> 00:21:10,618
Oh, my goodness. Um...

249
00:21:10,685 --> 00:21:13,518
- Mr. Popham...
- No, you don't. No, you don't.

250
00:21:18,260 --> 00:21:21,752
That must have been the invalid boy.

251
00:21:23,865 --> 00:21:26,857
Mr. Popham, about that first letter.
I wrote it.

252
00:21:26,935 --> 00:21:31,634
No need to go on. What you've done
has come to me like a blinding flash.

253
00:21:31,706 --> 00:21:33,697
Pa.

254
00:21:34,709 --> 00:21:37,405
Pa, there's a boy up here.

255
00:21:37,479 --> 00:21:41,006
It's the Carey boy.
Come on down, Lallie Joy.

256
00:21:42,818 --> 00:21:46,584
That's my daughter, Lallie Joy.
She's awful shy.

257
00:21:46,655 --> 00:21:49,488
She'd be more like me
only her ma won't let her.

258
00:21:49,558 --> 00:21:51,992
Look at me, Mother! Look at me!

259
00:21:52,060 --> 00:21:54,654
- Wee!
- Peter? Where are you?

260
00:21:54,729 --> 00:21:57,391
Look at me!

261
00:21:57,466 --> 00:22:01,459
Wee! Wee! Look at me!

262
00:22:01,536 --> 00:22:04,232
That must be the rickety baby.

263
00:22:08,343 --> 00:22:11,835
Mr. Popham, I think it's time
I told you everything.

264
00:22:11,913 --> 00:22:14,905
Oh, may I tell him, Mother, please?

265
00:22:14,983 --> 00:22:20,250
You see, Mr. Popham,
I wrote that letter and we all...

266
00:22:20,322 --> 00:22:22,586
Oh, I don't know how to begin.

267
00:22:47,048 --> 00:22:49,710
Gee, I'm sorry.

268
00:22:51,586 --> 00:22:54,077
They're too heavy for a girl.

269
00:22:55,490 --> 00:22:57,481
Allow me.

270
00:23:02,163 --> 00:23:05,530
You don't have to be nice or nothing.
She's my sister.

271
00:23:09,871 --> 00:23:12,032
And that's the way it was.

272
00:23:14,042 --> 00:23:18,445
Well, Nancy, the way I figure it,
this worid's the only worid we've got.

273
00:23:18,513 --> 00:23:20,674
That is, until we move on
to the next one.

274
00:23:21,216 --> 00:23:24,515
And there ain't nothing like a story
that's a mite off'n the truth

275
00:23:24,586 --> 00:23:26,577
for making things interesting.

276
00:23:26,655 --> 00:23:28,816
Like a painter improving on nature.

277
00:23:28,890 --> 00:23:31,450
Yes. It ain't nothing like
an out-and-out lie.

278
00:23:31,526 --> 00:23:35,656
Of course not! Just a small white one,
only colored a little.

279
00:23:35,730 --> 00:23:38,528
You see, Mother,
Mr. Popham understands.

280
00:23:38,600 --> 00:23:41,501
Now the first thing we must do
is fix up this house.

281
00:23:42,137 --> 00:23:44,037
Now, where to begin?

282
00:23:45,907 --> 00:23:49,900
Well, standing before you is the best
painter, carpenter, bricklayer in Maine.

283
00:23:49,978 --> 00:23:51,969
You're wonderful!

284
00:23:52,981 --> 00:23:56,075
Mr. Popham,
one part of Nancy's letter was true.

285
00:23:56,151 --> 00:23:58,745
- We don't have much money.
- Oh, money.

286
00:23:58,820 --> 00:24:02,950
Forget about the money. When
it's all done, we can figure that out.

287
00:24:03,024 --> 00:24:07,017
I work cheap when I can take my time
and get into some conversing.

288
00:24:11,232 --> 00:24:13,291
Well, I ain't one to hurry.

289
00:24:14,703 --> 00:24:17,263
We got one hurrier in the family
and that's enough.

290
00:24:17,339 --> 00:24:19,933
Mrs. Popham does everything
right on the dot.

291
00:24:20,008 --> 00:24:22,909
Sometimes I get terrible sick
of seeing that dot.

292
00:24:22,978 --> 00:24:26,505
Which reminds me,
it's getting along toward noon time.

293
00:24:26,581 --> 00:24:28,640
I'd better be digging for home.

294
00:24:28,717 --> 00:24:31,481
Mariah sits
and looks at the clock from 11:00 on.

295
00:24:31,553 --> 00:24:34,522
Then she'll get a meal
of cold pork and greens,

296
00:24:34,589 --> 00:24:39,993
cold string beans, ginger bread
and custard pie on the table.

297
00:24:40,061 --> 00:24:42,427
Then she'll holler, "Hurry up, Ossian!"

298
00:24:42,497 --> 00:24:46,695
"It struck 12:00 more than two minutes
ago and everything's getting overdone!"

299
00:24:46,768 --> 00:24:50,329
- Well, so long, folks.
- Goodbye! Thank you.

300
00:24:58,913 --> 00:25:01,711
Thanks for letting me
crank her up, Digby.

301
00:25:12,794 --> 00:25:15,058
Pa, I've been doing some thinking.

302
00:25:15,130 --> 00:25:17,792
Good. Thinking never hurt anybody.

303
00:25:19,000 --> 00:25:23,164
Pa, do you realize the farthest I've
ever been from Beulah is Four Corners

304
00:25:23,238 --> 00:25:25,399
and I was too young to even remember?

305
00:25:26,541 --> 00:25:28,099
What are you getting at, Son?

306
00:25:28,176 --> 00:25:32,545
Pa, do you realize I ain't never
seen nothing or done nothing?

307
00:25:34,115 --> 00:25:36,982
- Go on.
- You yourself said, Pa,

308
00:25:37,052 --> 00:25:39,748
a man never gets anywhere
standing in one place.

309
00:25:40,655 --> 00:25:43,522
How much am I paying you, Digby?

310
00:25:43,591 --> 00:25:47,789
Three dollars a week. But a fella
can make that in one day in the city.

311
00:25:49,931 --> 00:25:52,229
You gonna put a stop to it, Pa?

312
00:25:54,302 --> 00:25:57,738
Nope. Might as well
get it out of your system.

313
00:25:59,708 --> 00:26:02,302
Might be coming
about the right time, too.

314
00:26:03,545 --> 00:26:09,006
The boy, Gilbert. He ought to be able to
take on the job of driving this truck.

315
00:26:10,552 --> 00:26:13,749
That Gilly boy. He's awful nice, Pa.

316
00:26:16,191 --> 00:26:20,992
I got a feeling the money
might come in handy for the Careys, too.

317
00:26:21,062 --> 00:26:25,260
They're wonderful folks.
Even if they ain't got the rickets.

318
00:26:42,050 --> 00:26:44,541
Oh, smell it, Mother.

319
00:26:51,025 --> 00:26:53,323
Listen.

320
00:26:56,498 --> 00:26:59,228
I feel sorry for city people tonight.

321
00:27:02,137 --> 00:27:09,134
<i># Summer magic</i>

322
00:27:09,210 --> 00:27:17,140

Whoa! Whoa!

344
00:29:56,210 --> 00:29:59,907
- Slow it down!
- Look out with that fool contraption!

345
00:29:59,981 --> 00:30:02,245
- Slow it down!
- I can't!

346
00:30:03,184 --> 00:30:04,776
Watch out!

347
00:30:17,432 --> 00:30:20,765
Oh, gosh, I'm sorry, Digby.

348
00:30:20,835 --> 00:30:25,238
Forget it. She was about to blow anyway.
Lallie Joy, another tire to fix.

349
00:30:25,306 --> 00:30:28,332
- It was my fault. Let me fix it.
- Oh, no.

350
00:30:28,409 --> 00:30:30,673
Digby always lets me fix the flat tires.

351
00:30:32,080 --> 00:30:34,742
But if I'm gonna take over your job
I'd better learn how

352
00:30:34,816 --> 00:30:37,216
in case one blows when she's not around.

353
00:30:38,219 --> 00:30:39,914
Might.

354
00:30:39,988 --> 00:30:42,320
Uh... you can watch.

355
00:30:43,958 --> 00:30:46,518
Mrs. Popham,
I've just been longing to meet you.

356
00:30:46,594 --> 00:30:51,657
I suppose your husband's been too modest
to tell you we all think he's a saint.

357
00:30:52,834 --> 00:30:55,132
Nope. Never dared mention it.

358
00:30:55,203 --> 00:30:58,229
I'm afraid he hides his light
under a bushel.

359
00:30:58,306 --> 00:31:00,968
He hides more than his light
under that bushel.

360
00:31:01,042 --> 00:31:06,070
- There's a whole mess of things...
- What a glorious, quaint little store.

361
00:31:06,147 --> 00:31:09,082
You must just adore working in it.

362
00:31:09,150 --> 00:31:14,588
There's all those things for the house.
Wallpaper, brushes. Paint.

363
00:31:15,390 --> 00:31:19,121
Maybe we shouldn't splash things all
over without Mr. Hamilton's approval.

364
00:31:19,193 --> 00:31:21,718
No need to get permissión
for such puny things.

365
00:31:21,796 --> 00:31:24,822
I told you, he's got deep-seated faith
in my judgment.

366
00:31:25,466 --> 00:31:28,924
Nancy, you'd better give Mrs. Popham
your mother's grocery list.

367
00:31:29,003 --> 00:31:31,062
Take her mind off'n what it's on.

368
00:31:33,174 --> 00:31:35,472
Just a saint.

369
00:31:35,543 --> 00:31:40,173
Now, we know we need
wallpaper and brushes.

370
00:31:40,248 --> 00:31:43,911
And you know those little tools
that you use to scrape off...

371
00:31:43,985 --> 00:31:48,046
I'm the king!
I'm the king! I'm the king!

372
00:31:48,122 --> 00:31:50,113
Can I play?

373
00:31:51,392 --> 00:31:55,123
- We don't play with giris.
- I'm not a girl.

374
00:31:55,196 --> 00:31:59,155
- You got sissy hair.
- It's not sissy in Boston.

375
00:31:59,233 --> 00:32:02,760
Sissy hair! Sissy hair! Sissy hair!

376
00:32:02,837 --> 00:32:08,241
- You wanna fight?
- We don't fight with giris. Beat it!

377
00:32:11,112 --> 00:32:12,602
Ooh! She's mad!

378
00:32:12,680 --> 00:32:15,672
She'll pull your hair!

379
00:32:20,888 --> 00:32:24,324
Hey, let's go swimming!
Last one in's a sissy from Boston!

380
00:32:24,392 --> 00:32:27,452
Fraidy cats!
Come back and fight! Cowards!

381
00:32:29,831 --> 00:32:32,732
Hank. Haircuts for the lot.
Be back to pick 'em up later.

382
00:32:32,800 --> 00:32:34,563
Get down, boys.

383
00:32:48,416 --> 00:32:52,318
Now you're taking over,
here you are, Barney Oldfield.

384
00:32:52,386 --> 00:32:56,482
- Say, thanks.
- Osh, I forgot to buy a stepladder.

385
00:32:56,557 --> 00:32:59,025
Now you're talking like city folk.

386
00:33:00,361 --> 00:33:03,489
Country folks don't buy stepladders.

387
00:33:03,564 --> 00:33:06,328
- They borrow them.
- Oh.

388
00:33:18,012 --> 00:33:21,971
- We forgot Peter!
- I'll see that he gets home all right.

389
00:33:30,591 --> 00:33:36,154
Mr. Popham. Now that you've a spare
minute thrust upon you, I'd like a word.

390
00:33:36,230 --> 00:33:40,929
Mariah, why don't you get back to them
strawberry preserves you're fixing?

391
00:33:41,002 --> 00:33:43,232
Mr. Popham.

392
00:33:44,172 --> 00:33:46,970
Just answer me yes or no.

393
00:33:47,041 --> 00:33:49,601
Have you written to Mr. Hamilton

394
00:33:49,677 --> 00:33:53,704
advising him that you took it on
yourself to rent the yellow house?

395
00:33:53,781 --> 00:33:56,181
I told you I have written to him.

396
00:33:56,250 --> 00:33:58,343
Has he written you?

397
00:33:59,620 --> 00:34:02,612
Mm, no. He's a busy man.

398
00:34:03,791 --> 00:34:06,954
No news is good news.

399
00:34:07,028 --> 00:34:11,397
Besides, he's off in them foreign parts.
Heathens might have ate him.

400
00:34:12,266 --> 00:34:15,235
And you're letting them Careys
tear his house apart.

401
00:34:15,303 --> 00:34:20,400
Redoing, planting.
Young 'uns running all over the place.

402
00:34:20,474 --> 00:34:23,102
Selling 'em wallpaper
for less than it cost you.

403
00:34:23,177 --> 00:34:25,611
That lot never did move.

404
00:34:25,680 --> 00:34:28,979
They got you bewitched and I know why.

405
00:34:29,050 --> 00:34:31,814
You wore out in the people in this town
with your stories

406
00:34:31,886 --> 00:34:34,047
and now you got new ears
to listen to you.

407
00:34:34,121 --> 00:34:35,986
But you'll be bewitcheder

408
00:34:36,057 --> 00:34:40,153
when Mr. Hamilton lands back in Beulah
some fine day and wants his house back.

409
00:34:40,228 --> 00:34:42,389
I'm warning you, Mr. Popham.

410
00:34:42,463 --> 00:34:44,727
If you don't get a letter from him soon,

411
00:34:44,799 --> 00:34:47,393
I'm gonna take matters
into my own hands.

412
00:34:48,269 --> 00:34:51,238
Mariah, your pot's boiling over.

413
00:34:51,305 --> 00:34:52,897
Oh!

414
00:34:56,644 --> 00:34:59,112
What do you mean, I owe you $1.25?

415
00:34:59,180 --> 00:35:01,808
All I know is, I cut five heads.

416
00:35:01,882 --> 00:35:04,248
All I know is, I got four kids.

417
00:35:04,318 --> 00:35:07,947
One, two, three, four.

418
00:35:08,022 --> 00:35:10,923
Maybe so, but I cut five heads.

419
00:35:10,992 --> 00:35:13,790
You trying to tell me
one of my son's got two heads?

420
00:35:17,898 --> 00:35:21,129
I seen and cut five.

421
00:35:21,202 --> 00:35:25,161
Maybe you better get yourself
a pair of spectacles.

422
00:35:25,239 --> 00:35:28,208
I sent four in, and I'm picking up four.

423
00:35:30,711 --> 00:35:34,841
- All right. Forget it.
- Into the wagon, boys.

424
00:35:43,224 --> 00:35:46,819
- How many heads did he cut, Peter?
- Five.

425
00:35:46,894 --> 00:35:50,990
How am I going to get a job in this town
if people think I'm a girl?

426
00:35:51,899 --> 00:35:54,129
Oh, so you're going to look for work.

427
00:35:54,201 --> 00:35:57,068
I'm the only boy in the family
that's not working.

428
00:35:58,806 --> 00:36:01,900
That puts
a different complexion on things.

429
00:36:02,910 --> 00:36:06,676
You see,
you got on a handsome city outfit.

430
00:36:06,747 --> 00:36:09,443
It's too good to work in.

431
00:36:09,517 --> 00:36:14,580
A man hiring you might get the idea
that maybe you wouldn't buckle down.

432
00:36:14,655 --> 00:36:18,523
- Oh, I'll buckle down.
- Why, of course you will.

433
00:36:18,592 --> 00:36:23,029
So... maybe we ought to arrange
for a little swap.

434
00:36:23,097 --> 00:36:27,591
I've been looking for a Buster Brown
suit just about that size.

435
00:36:27,668 --> 00:36:31,729
So if you'd consider swapping it
for a pair of overalls to work in...

436
00:36:31,806 --> 00:36:37,540
- With patches on it?
- Of course with patches. And a shirt.

437
00:36:38,446 --> 00:36:41,904
That's a very, very fine piece of goods.

438
00:36:41,982 --> 00:36:44,849
So, I won't take advantage of you.

439
00:36:46,087 --> 00:36:50,490
Now, suppose that I...
that I give you...

440
00:36:50,558 --> 00:36:52,651
two bits to boot.

441
00:36:52,727 --> 00:36:57,426
- A quarter?
- That's a lot of money.

442
00:36:57,498 --> 00:37:02,834
Hank Champlin has to cut a whole head
of hair before he makes that much.

443
00:37:02,903 --> 00:37:06,339
And he's got six mouths to feed
at his house, too.

444
00:37:06,407 --> 00:37:11,003
Osh, with the two bits to boot,
I can pay him for my fifth head.

445
00:37:12,279 --> 00:37:14,577
Be right back.

446
00:37:20,921 --> 00:37:24,755
Just one ladder in the house. We'll
find something for you to stand on.

447
00:37:24,825 --> 00:37:27,157
Oh, that's all right, Mrs Carey.

448
00:37:27,228 --> 00:37:30,686
Oh, Mother,
if we make the house so beautiful,

449
00:37:30,765 --> 00:37:33,097
suppose Mr. Hamilton
will want it for himself?

450
00:37:34,568 --> 00:37:38,504
Well, the way it looks now,
I don't think he would.

451
00:37:39,940 --> 00:37:42,170
He could suddenly descend upon us.

452
00:37:42,243 --> 00:37:45,337
He could swoop down
like the Yellow Peril.

453
00:37:52,787 --> 00:37:55,085
- Now, do be careful.
- Oh, it's all right.

454
00:37:55,156 --> 00:37:58,853
Ooh... just get it up here.

455
00:38:01,128 --> 00:38:04,097
Don't you think you ought
to have someone to help you?

456
00:38:04,165 --> 00:38:06,690
Mother, any idiot can hang wallpaper.

457
00:38:08,035 --> 00:38:10,094
Oh!

458
00:38:10,171 --> 00:38:14,972
Mother! Mother, come here!
I want to show you something!

459
00:38:15,042 --> 00:38:16,737
Oh!

460
00:38:22,450 --> 00:38:25,578
- Get him out!
- He won't bite! His name's Sam!

461
00:38:29,690 --> 00:38:32,056
Come here, Sam!
I want you to meet Mother!

462
00:38:32,126 --> 00:38:34,890
- Get out!
- Here, Sam!

463
00:38:34,962 --> 00:38:36,896
Ooh! Get him out!

464
00:38:36,964 --> 00:38:39,660
- Here, Sam!
- Oh, my paper!

465
00:38:39,733 --> 00:38:41,826
Don't just stand there!
Try to catch him!

466
00:38:45,239 --> 00:38:48,299
Here, Sam! Come on! Here!

467
00:38:49,376 --> 00:38:51,844
Don't hurt him! Don't hurt my dog!

468
00:38:51,912 --> 00:38:54,472
- Get him out!
- Catch him!

469
00:38:57,852 --> 00:39:00,343
- Stop him!
- Catch him! Catch him!

470
00:39:00,421 --> 00:39:04,323
- Oh, Sam!
- Come here!

471
00:39:05,426 --> 00:39:09,556
Come here, boy!
I'll get him! He minds me!

472
00:39:18,506 --> 00:39:22,840
- See? He loves you, Mother.
- I want that dog out of here.

473
00:39:22,910 --> 00:39:25,845
- His name's Sam.
- Outside.

474
00:39:25,913 --> 00:39:28,279
But I promised this man I'd keep him.

475
00:39:28,349 --> 00:39:30,943
- What man?
- A rich man.

476
00:39:31,018 --> 00:39:33,145
I told him I'd board Sam.

477
00:39:33,220 --> 00:39:36,849
Why, Peter, an enormous thing like that
would eat us out of house and home.

478
00:39:36,924 --> 00:39:38,915
But we're getting paid.

479
00:39:39,894 --> 00:39:44,558
You explained about everybody doing
their share, and Sam's my share.

480
00:39:44,632 --> 00:39:48,625
- I'm getting paid 25 cents.
- A meal?

481
00:39:48,702 --> 00:39:51,034
- A week.
- Oh, no.

482
00:39:51,105 --> 00:39:54,438
I'm sorry, Peter. We can't do it.
You'll have to take him back.

483
00:39:54,508 --> 00:39:56,999
But I can't.
The man's already left town.

484
00:39:57,077 --> 00:39:58,669
Oh, my goodness.

485
00:39:58,746 --> 00:40:01,874
The man's gonna pay me
the next time he sees me.

486
00:40:01,949 --> 00:40:04,417
You mean you didn't get it?

487
00:40:10,658 --> 00:40:13,388
- What happened to your hair?
- I got it cut.

488
00:40:13,460 --> 00:40:16,429
And your eye. You've been in a fight.

489
00:40:16,497 --> 00:40:19,557
- They called me a sissy.
- And where did you get those rags?

490
00:40:19,633 --> 00:40:22,500
These aren't rags.
These are my working clothes.

491
00:40:22,570 --> 00:40:26,529
- Working clothes?
- Ahem. Not to change the subject,

492
00:40:26,607 --> 00:40:30,099
but here's a special delivery letter
for you, Mrs. Carey.

493
00:40:30,177 --> 00:40:32,441
Special delivery?

494
00:40:33,380 --> 00:40:35,075
Thank you.

495
00:40:35,149 --> 00:40:39,347
- Hey, you ought to see me...
- Shh! Special delivery.

496
00:40:39,420 --> 00:40:41,445
Oh.

497
00:40:42,990 --> 00:40:45,015
What is it?

498
00:40:46,193 --> 00:40:48,457
What does it say, Mother?

499
00:40:48,529 --> 00:40:52,192
Julia.
She's coming to stay with us next week.

500
00:40:52,266 --> 00:40:55,963
- Oh, no!
- Oh, please! Not Julia!

501
00:41:03,177 --> 00:41:04,872
Oh!

502
00:41:08,182 --> 00:41:11,777
Best leave these folks to their grief.
Come along, Lallie Joy.

503
00:41:11,852 --> 00:41:15,948
Do I have to have to, Pa?
It's been real interesting here.

504
00:41:16,023 --> 00:41:19,424
Yes, come along.
See you tomorrow.

505
00:41:19,493 --> 00:41:23,486
Goodbye, Osh.
And thanks for everything.

506
00:41:26,166 --> 00:41:30,830
And I want you two
out of those dying gladiator attitudes.

507
00:41:30,904 --> 00:41:35,637
Julia is your cousin, and a Carey. And
I don't want you to forget that, ever.

508
00:41:35,709 --> 00:41:38,041
- Forget it?
- Nancy.

509
00:41:38,112 --> 00:41:42,173
Try to realize that Julia's story
is rather a sad one.

510
00:41:42,249 --> 00:41:44,444
She never even knew her mother.

511
00:41:44,518 --> 00:41:46,315
And after her dear father died,

512
00:41:46,387 --> 00:41:49,447
the Fergusons very kindly took her in
and raised her.

513
00:41:49,523 --> 00:41:53,550
Kindly took her in?
George Ferguson had a guilty conscience.

514
00:41:53,627 --> 00:41:57,290
He knew those stocks he sold her father
were as worthless as ours.

515
00:41:57,364 --> 00:42:01,061
She's the Fergusons' responsibility.
Why dump her on us?

516
00:42:01,135 --> 00:42:04,104
Because now George writes
he can't keep her.

517
00:42:04,171 --> 00:42:06,935
Another unfortunate investment.

518
00:42:07,007 --> 00:42:08,702
Mm.

519
00:42:08,776 --> 00:42:12,610
But there is one thing we're going
to do. We're going to welcome her.

520
00:42:12,680 --> 00:42:14,580
Really welcome her.

521
00:42:14,648 --> 00:42:18,175
As a cousin, and as a young girl
who has no other home to go to.

522
00:42:18,252 --> 00:42:21,050
Well, we didn't really have a home
for a while either.

523
00:42:21,121 --> 00:42:24,784
But we didn't go around begging
all our old relatives to take us in.

524
00:42:30,931 --> 00:42:33,365
Have you both forgotten?

525
00:42:33,434 --> 00:42:35,561
We had each other.

526
00:42:40,708 --> 00:42:45,077
Julia doesn't know any of this
and it would kill her if she found out.

527
00:42:45,145 --> 00:42:47,705
So not one word out of either of you.

528
00:42:47,781 --> 00:42:50,249
All right, Mother.
The more the hungrier.

529
00:42:53,387 --> 00:42:57,483
- Find some place for that dog to sleep.
- There's room on my bed.

530
00:42:57,558 --> 00:42:59,822
Outside.

531
00:43:02,663 --> 00:43:04,392
Julia!

532
00:43:05,332 --> 00:43:09,632
Well, I'll be nice to her
for Mother's sake, but Julia's a pill.

533
00:43:09,703 --> 00:43:11,568
Complete.

534
00:43:13,107 --> 00:43:16,201
And she does think
she's the pink of perfection.

535
00:43:29,223 --> 00:43:32,488
<i># She's the pink of perfection</i>

536
00:43:32,559 --> 00:43:38,088
<i># From her prissy pink nose</i>
<i>to her custard complexion</i>

537
00:43:38,165 --> 00:43:40,861
<i># And eleven pink toes</i>

538
00:43:40,934 --> 00:43:44,335
<i># With a chin like a prune</i>

539
00:43:44,404 --> 00:43:48,932
<i># She's a dainty baboon</i>

540
00:43:49,009 --> 00:43:54,470
<i># And she thinks</i>
<i>she's the pink of perfection</i>

541
00:43:55,582 --> 00:43:58,278
<i># She's the pink of perfection</i>

542
00:43:58,352 --> 00:44:00,820
<i># Made of skimmed milk and rice</i>

543
00:44:00,888 --> 00:44:03,721
<i># She's a witch's confection</i>

544
00:44:03,791 --> 00:44:06,191
<i># Makes your blood turn to ice</i>

545
00:44:06,260 --> 00:44:09,593
<i># Like a stale Charlotte Russe</i>

546
00:44:09,663 --> 00:44:13,759
<i># With the charm of a moose</i>

547
00:44:13,834 --> 00:44:19,500
<i># And she thinks</i>
<i>she's the pink of perfection</i>

548
00:44:20,808 --> 00:44:24,335
<i># Never walked there a creature</i>

549
00:44:24,411 --> 00:44:27,869
<i># With features so fair</i>

550
00:44:27,948 --> 00:44:31,179
<i># Like a Lillian Russell...</i>

551
00:44:31,852 --> 00:44:36,414
<i># Without any hair</i>

552
00:44:37,491 --> 00:44:43,191
<i># She's a princess presiding</i>
<i>in diaphanous gowns</i>

553
00:44:43,263 --> 00:44:49,031
<i># With a face and a figure</i>
<i>that's the envy of clowns</i>

554
00:44:49,102 --> 00:44:52,799
<i># She's a knock-kneed gazelle</i>

555
00:44:52,873 --> 00:44:57,139
<i># With a voice like a bell</i>

556
00:45:00,013 --> 00:45:06,077
<i># And she thinks</i>
<i>she's the pink of perfection #</i>

557
00:45:07,821 --> 00:45:10,551
Gee, I can't wait to see her.

558
00:45:31,245 --> 00:45:34,146
Here, Sam. Come on, boy. Come on.

559
00:45:35,883 --> 00:45:38,909
Come on, boy. Come on. Come on, boy.

560
00:45:42,256 --> 00:45:44,918
Here, Sam. Come on, boy.

561
00:45:50,931 --> 00:45:54,298
Quiet, boy! Quiet!
You're not supposed to be in here.

562
00:45:54,368 --> 00:45:56,427
But if you get out early in the morning

563
00:45:56,503 --> 00:45:59,097
and don't come in nights
till my light goes out,

564
00:45:59,172 --> 00:46:01,572
you can always sleep with me.

565
00:46:01,642 --> 00:46:03,633
Go to sleep now.

566
00:46:09,316 --> 00:46:12,285
What a charming place, I don't think.

567
00:46:12,352 --> 00:46:15,048
- What's wrong with it?
- Why, everything!

568
00:46:15,122 --> 00:46:18,148
If one must have Maine,
why not Bar Harbor?

569
00:46:18,225 --> 00:46:20,557
This place is truly primitive.

570
00:46:20,627 --> 00:46:23,653
- Sure is.
- Practically unsettled.

571
00:46:24,998 --> 00:46:28,024
Of course, we don't see
too many Indians nowadays.

572
00:46:28,101 --> 00:46:30,035
But there's plenty of wildlife.

573
00:46:31,271 --> 00:46:33,796
What kind of wildlife?

574
00:46:33,874 --> 00:46:38,538
Oh, the usual.
Not too many moose. Some wild cats.

575
00:46:38,612 --> 00:46:42,104
- Lots of bears.
- And the ordinary small stuff.

576
00:46:42,182 --> 00:46:45,447
A wolf or two. Fox. Skunks.

577
00:46:46,586 --> 00:46:49,077
- Snakes?
- Oh, naturally.

578
00:46:49,156 --> 00:46:51,249
But only about one out of ten
is poisonous.

579
00:46:51,325 --> 00:46:53,657
So when we get bit we just have whiskey.

580
00:46:53,727 --> 00:46:55,991
Even Peter.

581
00:47:08,875 --> 00:47:13,471
Goodness, don't they even fix the roads
in this backwoods place?

582
00:47:13,547 --> 00:47:16,175
These aren't roads.
Just wilderness trails.

583
00:47:17,117 --> 00:47:20,416
Rapids ahead! Hold tight!
Maybe we'll make it!

584
00:47:37,371 --> 00:47:40,966
Hello, Peter. Let me out of this thing.

585
00:47:50,384 --> 00:47:53,148
- She's not knock-kneed, Nancy.
- Shh!

586
00:47:55,622 --> 00:47:57,852
Julia!

587
00:47:57,924 --> 00:48:00,552
- Oh, dear.
- Aunt Margaret.

588
00:48:00,627 --> 00:48:03,562
- Well. Welcome to the yellow house.
- Why, thank you.

589
00:48:03,630 --> 00:48:06,292
- Did you have a pleasant trip?
- It was a nightmare!

590
00:48:06,366 --> 00:48:09,893
No parlor car on the train.
And this wilderness!

591
00:48:09,970 --> 00:48:11,597
When I think of last summer,

592
00:48:11,671 --> 00:48:15,266
the glorious time Gladys Ferguson and I
had in Easthampton.

593
00:48:16,743 --> 00:48:18,233
Come along.

594
00:48:18,311 --> 00:48:22,645
But I must remember the last thing
that dear Mrs. Ferguson said to me.

595
00:48:22,716 --> 00:48:25,344
"Don't let poverty
drag you down, Julia."

596
00:48:25,419 --> 00:48:27,046
"Keep high thoughts

597
00:48:27,120 --> 00:48:30,146
and don't let them get soiled
by the grime of daily living."

598
00:48:33,293 --> 00:48:38,663
Oh, lovely. Especially the part
about the grime of daily living.

599
00:48:38,732 --> 00:48:42,498
- A pill.
- Complete. Utter.

600
00:48:42,569 --> 00:48:44,696
I think she's pretty.

601
00:48:44,771 --> 00:48:47,763
- Well, you go play with Sam. Vanish.
- Huh?

602
00:48:47,841 --> 00:48:49,866
Scat!

603
00:48:52,679 --> 00:48:56,638
Naturally, we dressed
for dinner every night.

604
00:48:56,716 --> 00:48:59,947
Gladys Ferguson's French maid
laid out our dresses for us.

605
00:49:00,020 --> 00:49:02,545
Really! We didn't have to turn a hand.

606
00:49:02,622 --> 00:49:06,285
Aunt Margaret, I do wish
you could see Gladys's wardrobe.

607
00:49:06,359 --> 00:49:08,520
All her things are exquisite.

608
00:49:08,595 --> 00:49:12,622
Nothing machine-stitched
has ever touched her skin.

609
00:49:12,699 --> 00:49:16,430
Everything hand sewn
by dear little nuns in Switzerland.

610
00:49:17,504 --> 00:49:20,234
Oh, and the dances, Nancy!

611
00:49:20,307 --> 00:49:24,869
Did I tell you that Gladys doesn't
know one boy that doesn't go to Harvard?

612
00:49:24,945 --> 00:49:26,242
Yes, you did.

613
00:49:26,313 --> 00:49:30,044
If you'll excuse me, Julia,
I have to get our boy to bed.

614
00:49:30,117 --> 00:49:34,986
Come along, Peter. You're going to sleep
with me tonight. Won't that be nice?

615
00:49:35,055 --> 00:49:36,386
Oh, no, I can't!

616
00:49:36,456 --> 00:49:39,823
Julia has to sleep in your room
until we get another bed in Nancy's.

617
00:49:39,893 --> 00:49:42,657
- Please! You don't know!
- Not another word.

618
00:49:42,729 --> 00:49:45,459
Good night, Julia. Breakfast at 7:00.

619
00:49:45,532 --> 00:49:47,500
- Good night, children.
- Night.

620
00:49:47,567 --> 00:49:50,229
- 7:00 in the morning?
- Mm.

621
00:49:50,303 --> 00:49:52,396
Good night, Aunt Margaret.

622
00:49:52,472 --> 00:49:55,805
- But, Mother, you don't...
- Run along, Peter.

623
00:49:56,476 --> 00:49:59,343
- Now, where was I?
- Ah, just a minute, Julia.

624
00:49:59,412 --> 00:50:02,506
- Everything locked up tight, Gilly?
- Oh, sure.

625
00:50:07,487 --> 00:50:10,354
- Ooh, dark tonight, isn't it?
- Inky.

626
00:50:15,362 --> 00:50:19,298
- Wouldn't like to be out alone.
- Uh-uh.

627
00:50:19,366 --> 00:50:22,699
- I remember when...
- Shh!

628
00:50:22,769 --> 00:50:24,464
What was that noise?

629
00:50:24,538 --> 00:50:29,168
- Sure you've got the bear locks on?
- Wouldn't dare forget them.

630
00:50:29,242 --> 00:50:31,676
Oh, well, I guess we're safe enough.

631
00:50:32,512 --> 00:50:34,002
Safe from what?

632
00:50:34,080 --> 00:50:37,948
Oh, nothing, nothing.
But this is the wilderness.

633
00:50:39,653 --> 00:50:42,713
Oh, well, I should think out here,
nobody would...

634
00:50:42,789 --> 00:50:44,780
Oh, nobody would.

635
00:50:45,625 --> 00:50:48,458
- They're just after honey.
- Who is?

636
00:50:50,630 --> 00:50:53,827
Well, I guess we've done
all that's humanly possible.

637
00:50:53,900 --> 00:50:56,368
Humanly.

638
00:50:56,436 --> 00:51:01,169
Are you ready for bed? Or would you
rather sit here alone and read a book?

639
00:51:01,241 --> 00:51:03,402
Oh, no, I think I'll go up with you.

640
00:51:05,545 --> 00:51:09,379
Hey, check the back door again, Gil.
Better be safe than sorry.

641
00:51:09,449 --> 00:51:11,440
Right.

642
00:51:12,118 --> 00:51:14,109
After you, Julia.

643
00:51:54,194 --> 00:51:55,821
Who's there?

644
00:52:02,235 --> 00:52:04,863
I tried to tell you!
I tried to tell you!

645
00:52:04,938 --> 00:52:07,600
Julia! Julia!

646
00:52:08,808 --> 00:52:10,901
Julia! Oh!

647
00:52:16,750 --> 00:52:18,877
Julia!

648
00:52:32,599 --> 00:52:34,829
Try to stop crying, dear.

649
00:52:35,669 --> 00:52:37,933
You'll make yourself sick.

650
00:52:38,004 --> 00:52:42,532
It was deliberately planned.
On purpose!

651
00:52:42,609 --> 00:52:47,546
- They're all against me!
- Nobody's against you in this house.

652
00:52:47,614 --> 00:52:50,242
We want you to be part of the family.

653
00:52:50,317 --> 00:52:54,310
But we have a little boy
and that little boy has a great big dog.

654
00:52:54,387 --> 00:52:58,118
Nobody cares what happens to me.

655
00:52:59,192 --> 00:53:02,184
- Julia?
- Oh!

656
00:53:03,763 --> 00:53:06,357
I heated some milk.

657
00:53:06,433 --> 00:53:08,458
I'll take it, dear.

658
00:53:09,436 --> 00:53:13,429
See that Peter sleeps in his bed.
I'm keeping Julia here with me.

659
00:53:13,506 --> 00:53:15,440
Yes, Mother.

660
00:53:16,576 --> 00:53:18,703
Julia?

661
00:53:22,282 --> 00:53:24,648
Good night, Mother.

662
00:53:24,718 --> 00:53:26,743
Good night, dear.

663
00:53:34,327 --> 00:53:36,318
How do you like that?

664
00:53:36,396 --> 00:53:40,389
Pink of Perfection raises the roof
and lands in a bed of roses.

665
00:53:42,369 --> 00:53:44,269
Where's Peter?

666
00:53:44,337 --> 00:53:46,965
I don't know. He's not in his room.

667
00:53:48,541 --> 00:53:50,702
Peter?

668
00:53:58,151 --> 00:54:00,210
Peter?

669
00:54:03,456 --> 00:54:07,153
Come on. Bed, Peter.
You can sleep in your own room tonight.

670
00:54:07,227 --> 00:54:09,695
- Sam too?
- No.

671
00:54:09,763 --> 00:54:13,631
But if Sam can't sleep with me,
can I sleep with Sam?

672
00:54:13,700 --> 00:54:17,261
- He's had a terrible scare.
- Come on to bed now, Peter.

673
00:54:17,337 --> 00:54:19,703
Nancy, Sam's upset!

674
00:54:20,373 --> 00:54:22,102
I know.

675
00:54:24,811 --> 00:54:26,802
Bye, Sam.

676
00:54:37,223 --> 00:54:40,317
Very good. Very good.

677
00:54:40,393 --> 00:54:42,657
You're gonna be a real carpenter.

678
00:55:00,113 --> 00:55:02,138
Osh!

679
00:55:02,215 --> 00:55:04,683
Look, Osh!

680
00:55:08,555 --> 00:55:10,580
Hm.

681
00:55:12,192 --> 00:55:15,025
He climbed up there all by himself.
He likes me.

682
00:55:17,063 --> 00:55:19,429
Mm, that's a mighty handsome critter.

683
00:55:20,733 --> 00:55:23,099
He has a very ugly face.

684
00:55:23,169 --> 00:55:26,297
Maybe he's thinking
the same thing about you!

685
00:55:27,740 --> 00:55:33,110
You know, the little critters of nature,
they don't know that they're ugly.

686
00:55:33,179 --> 00:55:36,580
- They don't?
- Except one.

687
00:55:36,649 --> 00:55:40,176
<i># Once a lonely caterpillar</i>

722
00:58:30,757 --> 00:58:34,488
Osh. Mother wants you.

723
00:58:40,967 --> 00:58:43,868
Not too hot, Lallie Joy.
Test it with your elbow.

724
00:58:43,936 --> 00:58:46,131
Julia, you can't take a bath in here.

725
00:58:46,205 --> 00:58:50,107
I'm tired of lugging
kettles of hot water upstairs.

726
00:58:50,910 --> 00:58:55,244
At the Fergusons', Gladys and I had
our own bath, right next to our room,

727
00:58:55,314 --> 00:58:57,680
with plenty of hot running water.

728
00:58:57,750 --> 00:59:00,685
This isn't the Fergusons'.
This is the Careys'.

729
00:59:01,387 --> 00:59:04,720
Well, it seems to me that
if the Careys are silly enough

730
00:59:04,791 --> 00:59:06,816
to spend money on a house
they don't own,

731
00:59:06,893 --> 00:59:08,884
the first thing they should have done

732
00:59:08,961 --> 00:59:13,193
was to install civilized plumbing
in this primitive place.

733
00:59:14,000 --> 00:59:15,797
Well, really!

734
00:59:17,670 --> 00:59:20,867
- Where is your ma?
- In the sewing room.

735
00:59:24,277 --> 00:59:29,010
Primitive or not, the Careys
are just as clean as the Fergusons.

736
00:59:29,082 --> 00:59:33,382
- Close the door, please.
- Lallie Joy, you're not her maid.

737
00:59:33,453 --> 00:59:35,444
Oh, I don't mind.

738
00:59:41,094 --> 00:59:44,029
- Did you want me for something?
- Yes, Osh.

739
00:59:44,097 --> 00:59:47,089
I've been figuring. Facing facts.

740
00:59:47,166 --> 00:59:49,225
I hate facts.

741
00:59:49,302 --> 00:59:53,432
Well, there's one very unpleasant one.
We haven't enough money.

742
00:59:53,506 --> 00:59:58,170
And if we want to stay in this house,
we won't be able to go on fixing it.

743
00:59:58,244 --> 01:00:01,042
But, Mother, we haven't even
started on the outside yet.

744
01:00:01,114 --> 01:00:04,106
We'll have to live in it the way it is.

745
01:00:04,183 --> 01:00:06,310
Oh, no!

746
01:00:08,087 --> 01:00:12,353
There's no hurry about paying me.
We'll figure that out some day.

747
01:00:12,425 --> 01:00:17,385
It won't do, Osh.
You're too kind. We can't accept it.

748
01:00:17,463 --> 01:00:20,455
There's the second rent payment
due Mr. Hamilton.

749
01:00:20,533 --> 01:00:24,162
Mr. Hamilton. Rent money.
I clean forgot.

750
01:00:24,237 --> 01:00:28,640
I got a letter. It's in my pocket.
No, I must have left it in my coat.

751
01:00:28,708 --> 01:00:30,903
Did he get my letter
about the improvements?

752
01:00:30,977 --> 01:00:33,445
Oh, yes, sir. Yes, sir.

753
01:00:33,513 --> 01:00:36,880
I put yours in with the one I wrote him
about that time.

754
01:00:36,949 --> 01:00:40,851
He was so darned overjoyed about
what you were doing to the old house,

755
01:00:40,920 --> 01:00:43,889
you know, adding to its value,

756
01:00:43,956 --> 01:00:46,754
that he wouldn't even consider
taking any rent money.

757
01:00:46,826 --> 01:00:49,727
No rent money?!

758
01:00:50,596 --> 01:00:55,158
- Mother! Won't that make a difference?
- We can't accept it.

759
01:00:55,234 --> 01:00:59,170
- Mr. Hamilton is very...
- Hold your horses there, Mrs. Carey.

760
01:00:59,238 --> 01:01:01,103
He wants a favor in return.

761
01:01:01,174 --> 01:01:03,938
- A favor? From us?
- Yes.

762
01:01:04,010 --> 01:01:08,913
He wants you to find a suitable place
for his dear mother's picture.

763
01:01:09,916 --> 01:01:13,079
- His mother's picture?
- Of course!

764
01:01:13,152 --> 01:01:16,019
Dear old soul. Portrait of a lady.

765
01:01:16,088 --> 01:01:19,819
- Where is she, Osh?
- Well... well, he hid her.

766
01:01:19,892 --> 01:01:22,360
He hid her away some place safe.

767
01:01:22,428 --> 01:01:26,125
He wrote it down real clear,
but it's just gone right out of my head.

768
01:01:26,199 --> 01:01:30,067
If you'll bring the letter, we'll follow
the instructions to the last detail.

769
01:01:30,136 --> 01:01:33,003
- She'll have a place of honor.
- That's the idea.

770
01:01:33,072 --> 01:01:38,271
He wrote something about a simple
little vase of flowers. On her birthday.

771
01:01:38,344 --> 01:01:40,278
Of course. Her birthday. When is it?

772
01:01:40,346 --> 01:01:41,870
Well, he...

773
01:01:41,948 --> 01:01:46,647
Well, it seems like he said
it was along the fall of the year.

774
01:01:46,719 --> 01:01:49,449
- Halloween.
- Halloween?

775
01:01:50,556 --> 01:01:54,492
- People are born on Halloween.
- It works out perfectly, Mother.

776
01:01:54,560 --> 01:01:57,791
It'll tie in with our housewarming.
We could have a ceremony.

777
01:01:57,864 --> 01:02:01,800
You know, candles, a simple bouquet,
her lovely painting above.

778
01:02:01,868 --> 01:02:05,895
- Probably by Sargent. Maybe Whistler.
- Sounds too good to be true.

779
01:02:05,972 --> 01:02:07,735
There's Gilly now.

780
01:02:09,375 --> 01:02:12,572
You see, Mother?
We were fated to live here!

781
01:02:20,887 --> 01:02:24,084
- Mariah, I was uh...
- Don't try to stop me, Mr. Popham.

782
01:02:24,223 --> 01:02:27,818
Well, of course not.
You making a social call?

783
01:02:27,894 --> 01:02:31,022
I ain't feeling social, Mr. Popham.

784
01:02:31,097 --> 01:02:34,692
I'm here to talk gospel truth
to Mrs. Carey.

785
01:02:34,767 --> 01:02:40,000
I searched the store for a letter
from Mr. Hamilton and I didn't find one.

786
01:02:40,072 --> 01:02:42,006
This whole thing's gone far enough.

787
01:02:42,074 --> 01:02:45,271
Uh... Well, what are you
going to tell the Careys, Mariah?

788
01:02:45,344 --> 01:02:47,335
My suspicions.

789
01:02:57,757 --> 01:02:59,725
Maybe it's why
I look on the dark side,

790
01:02:59,792 --> 01:03:02,693
living with Mr. Popham
and him so hopeful.

791
01:03:02,762 --> 01:03:05,356
Well, he certainly keeps our spirits up.

792
01:03:05,431 --> 01:03:09,197
That's 'cause you don't get him steady.
Hopefulness at meals.

793
01:03:09,268 --> 01:03:12,362
Hopefulness days. Hopefulness nights.

794
01:03:12,438 --> 01:03:15,339
One everlasting stream of hopefulness.

795
01:03:16,943 --> 01:03:19,878
Even as a boy, Mr. Popham
always looked on the bright side,

796
01:03:19,946 --> 01:03:22,244
whether there was any or not.

797
01:03:22,315 --> 01:03:24,875
His mother and father
got terrible sick of it.

798
01:03:25,017 --> 01:03:29,283
It's a wonderful faculty,
seeing the bright side of everything.

799
01:03:29,355 --> 01:03:35,123
Wonderful tiresome. I like to believe
in a cloud that's a first-class cloud.

800
01:03:35,194 --> 01:03:37,628
Thick and black clean through.

801
01:03:38,664 --> 01:03:41,724
I get tired to death
of Mr. Popham's silver linings.

802
01:03:41,801 --> 01:03:45,498
We all believe in silver linings
and rainbows. And...

803
01:03:45,571 --> 01:03:50,565
Well, I don't. I always expect the worst
and I ain't ever been disappointed.

804
01:03:51,644 --> 01:03:55,944
- It's why I came today, Mrs. Carey.
- Is something wrong, Mrs. Popham?

805
01:03:58,584 --> 01:04:00,415
My goodness.

806
01:04:03,255 --> 01:04:05,553
Osh!

807
01:04:05,624 --> 01:04:07,717
Osh!

808
01:04:09,195 --> 01:04:10,992
- Papa!
- Mr. Popham!

809
01:04:13,132 --> 01:04:16,363
- Oh, he's unconscious!
- Oh, speak to me, Papa.

810
01:04:16,435 --> 01:04:18,801
Ossian, can you hear me?

811
01:04:21,807 --> 01:04:24,037
Mariah.

812
01:04:24,110 --> 01:04:26,271
Julia, go tell Gilly to get the doctor.

813
01:04:26,345 --> 01:04:28,643
No, no, no! No, I'll be all right.

814
01:04:28,714 --> 01:04:30,648
I'll be all right.

815
01:04:30,716 --> 01:04:36,382
Just take me home, Mariah. It's my leg.

816
01:04:42,795 --> 01:04:44,729
Crank her up, Lallie Joy.

817
01:04:44,797 --> 01:04:47,129
This is for his head.

818
01:04:47,199 --> 01:04:49,599
I'll be all right once I get home.

819
01:04:49,668 --> 01:04:52,637
Oh! Be careful, Osh.

820
01:05:00,312 --> 01:05:02,212
For his head.

821
01:05:04,550 --> 01:05:06,609
That's it.

822
01:05:11,424 --> 01:05:13,824
- Hold on.
- Take care!

823
01:05:35,781 --> 01:05:37,908
- Good morning, Mrs. Carey.
- Good morning.

824
01:05:37,983 --> 01:05:41,077
This is Charles Bryant.
He's to be our new school teacher.

825
01:05:41,153 --> 01:05:44,680
- Mrs. Carey.
- We've been expecting you, Mr. Bryant.

826
01:05:44,757 --> 01:05:47,954
You seem very young
to be undertaking such a chore.

827
01:05:48,027 --> 01:05:51,963
- He's just out of college.
- Oh, I love his name.

828
01:05:52,031 --> 01:05:56,400
Charles Bryant. So dignified!

829
01:05:56,469 --> 01:06:00,599
- He looks young to be a teacher.
- Isn't he handsome?

830
01:06:00,673 --> 01:06:05,235
Aren't you sorry now you finished
that elegant finishing school?

831
01:06:07,046 --> 01:06:11,312
It might be the gracious thing to do
if we asked him to tea some time.

832
01:06:11,383 --> 01:06:16,184
Julia, that's an inspiration! How about
today for refreshments on the lawn?

833
01:06:16,255 --> 01:06:19,224
- Well, maybe a small affair.
- Yes.

834
01:06:19,291 --> 01:06:22,488
Oh, we'd better ask some others
so it's not too obvious.

835
01:06:22,561 --> 01:06:24,188
But we'll start with him.

836
01:06:24,263 --> 01:06:27,664
We needed new faces.
New ideas. And laughter.

837
01:06:27,733 --> 01:06:30,759
Mr. Lord forgets
what Beulah has given the Careys.

838
01:06:30,836 --> 01:06:32,963
- A new life.
- Oh, thank you.

839
01:06:33,772 --> 01:06:35,899
Oh...

840
01:06:35,975 --> 01:06:40,173
Here are two more Careys. Young ladies,
I'd like you to meet Mr. Bryant.

841
01:06:40,246 --> 01:06:42,214
He'll be your new teacher this fall.

842
01:06:42,281 --> 01:06:45,307
- How do you do?
- Oh, Mr. Lord, you've forgotten.

843
01:06:45,384 --> 01:06:47,409
I finished at Miss Somerville's.

844
01:06:47,486 --> 01:06:51,422
Then, Charles,
may I present Miss Nancy Carey

845
01:06:51,490 --> 01:06:54,084
and dear old Miss Julia Carey.

846
01:06:55,027 --> 01:06:58,087
- My pleasure, young ladies.
- Excuse me.

847
01:07:00,232 --> 01:07:02,325
Oh...

848
01:07:03,169 --> 01:07:07,128
Mr. Bryant, my cousin Julia and I
are having a little afternoon thing.

849
01:07:07,206 --> 01:07:09,640
- Affair.
- Affair today.

850
01:07:09,708 --> 01:07:12,108
- We do hope you'll be able to show up.
- Attend.

851
01:07:12,178 --> 01:07:15,545
Attend.
And get acquainted with everybody.

852
01:07:15,614 --> 01:07:18,310
- The thing's spur of the moment...
- Impromptu.

853
01:07:18,384 --> 01:07:20,249
Impromptu thing. Affair.

854
01:07:20,319 --> 01:07:22,685
And we do hope you'll be able to come.

855
01:07:22,755 --> 01:07:25,724
Of course we hope
that everyone will be able to come.

856
01:07:25,791 --> 01:07:27,622
But first, will you?

857
01:07:27,693 --> 01:07:31,220
- Oh, yes. I'd be delighted.
- Oh!

858
01:07:32,865 --> 01:07:34,833
Oh. Julia.

859
01:07:39,238 --> 01:07:44,039
Is it all right if Julia and I invite a
few friends to the house this afternoon?

860
01:07:44,109 --> 01:07:46,976
Why, I don't see why not, dear.

861
01:07:47,046 --> 01:07:50,812
Oh, good. We'd have died if you said no
'cause we've already invited him.

862
01:07:50,883 --> 01:07:53,181
Him?

863
01:07:56,522 --> 01:08:00,481
Nancy and Julia have invited friends
for a lawn party this afternoon.

864
01:08:00,559 --> 01:08:02,686
- Will you be sure to come?
- Be happy to.

865
01:08:02,761 --> 01:08:04,092
Good.

866
01:08:07,233 --> 01:08:10,225
Now. Let's see which one of you ladies

867
01:08:10,302 --> 01:08:14,068
is going to be old Mrs. Hamilton.

868
01:08:30,656 --> 01:08:35,025
Now, I've seen you some place before.

869
01:09:01,754 --> 01:09:05,656
Ossian, dinner's on the table
and it's getting colder by the minute.

870
01:09:07,660 --> 01:09:12,597
Oh! Mr. Popham, what are you doing
with them women? It's the Sabbath!

871
01:09:12,665 --> 01:09:16,761
Well, looking for a work of art
to take over to the Careys'.

872
01:09:21,273 --> 01:09:25,004
They've got a lot of wall space there.

873
01:09:27,913 --> 01:09:29,972
Hand me that old apron.

874
01:09:30,049 --> 01:09:32,449
Can't take any of that junk.

875
01:09:35,788 --> 01:09:38,086
She's got a kind face.

876
01:09:38,157 --> 01:09:40,682
It's a pity she's got printing on her.

877
01:09:41,994 --> 01:09:44,724
There's only one that's fit to hang.

878
01:09:45,564 --> 01:09:47,691
Mrs. Griswold.

879
01:09:47,766 --> 01:09:51,202
She wasn't much to look at,
but she was a good woman.

880
01:09:51,270 --> 01:09:53,966
Spent her life on the opposing side.

881
01:09:54,039 --> 01:09:58,066
And if she hadn't went down
in the wreck off Nantucket Light,

882
01:09:58,143 --> 01:10:01,544
the demon rum would have been
chased off the New England coast.

883
01:10:02,881 --> 01:10:04,906
A real martyr.

884
01:10:04,983 --> 01:10:07,008
Insisted on going down with the ship.

885
01:10:07,853 --> 01:10:11,949
Everybody else was saved.
Crew and captain.

886
01:10:12,024 --> 01:10:13,651
Hm.

887
01:10:13,726 --> 01:10:16,889
That's a mighty inspiring story.

888
01:10:20,065 --> 01:10:25,799
Mariah. Relax and enjoy yourself
today at the Careys', will you?

889
01:10:25,871 --> 01:10:30,171
This is no time to go upsetting them
with cold facts.

890
01:10:30,242 --> 01:10:35,475
Very well, Mr. Popham. But the town
constable will come in here one day,

891
01:10:35,547 --> 01:10:39,745
catch you up on your sins, and
you'll spend your life in state prison.

892
01:10:39,818 --> 01:10:44,881
Ain't you forgetting the town constable
is named Ossian Popham?

893
01:11:02,207 --> 01:11:04,937
Where's the cake knife?
Where are all the napkins?

894
01:11:05,010 --> 01:11:09,504
- And where's Julia?
- Upstairs in her room. Primping.

895
01:11:09,581 --> 01:11:14,245
Oh, charming. "We'll give
a little social affair. We'll invite..."

896
01:11:14,319 --> 01:11:16,287
Oh! Here he comes!

897
01:11:21,593 --> 01:11:23,652
- Mr. Bryant!
- Oh! Miss Nancy!

898
01:11:23,729 --> 01:11:26,562
You must be exhausted,
peddling all the way from town.

899
01:11:26,632 --> 01:11:28,361
Oh, it keeps me in condition.

900
01:11:28,434 --> 01:11:31,528
All the same, I think you could use
a nice glass of lemonade.

901
01:11:31,603 --> 01:11:33,764
Oh, that sounds great.

902
01:11:35,274 --> 01:11:38,300
I couldn't help noticing
your Phi Beta Kappa key.

903
01:11:38,377 --> 01:11:40,470
You must be terribly proud of it.

904
01:11:40,546 --> 01:11:42,776
Oh, well, they're really quite common.

905
01:11:42,848 --> 01:11:45,043
They're unique in Beulah.

906
01:11:47,519 --> 01:11:51,421
I do hope you don't find yourself in
an intellectual desert here, Mr. Bryant.

907
01:11:51,490 --> 01:11:54,982
Ice cream, Gilly. Without anyone
really to talk to, I mean.

908
01:11:55,060 --> 01:11:58,052
- What did you major in, Mr Bryant?
- English Lit, but I...

909
01:11:58,130 --> 01:12:01,031
Oh, literature! I love it! Poetry.

910
01:12:01,099 --> 01:12:05,468
"This is the forest primeval,
the murmuring pines and the hemlocks..."

911
01:12:05,537 --> 01:12:08,005
- Here.
- Two scoops.

912
01:12:08,073 --> 01:12:10,837
Ah... Oh. No napkins. I'll get them.

913
01:12:12,878 --> 01:12:16,314
- Mr. Bryant?
- Oh. Thank you.

914
01:12:29,294 --> 01:12:33,025
You're rather late arriving
at the little affair we are giving.

915
01:12:33,098 --> 01:12:36,033
Dear Nancy,
you look so hot and exhausted.

916
01:12:36,101 --> 01:12:38,797
Bathe your face
and run a comb through your hair.

917
01:12:38,871 --> 01:12:41,669
- I've been working.
- That's what I mean.

918
01:12:41,740 --> 01:12:43,731
You look it.

919
01:12:52,484 --> 01:12:56,511
Oh, Mr. Bryant, you shouldn't
be standing out here in this hot sun.

920
01:13:00,726 --> 01:13:03,593
I think we can find some shade.

921
01:13:03,662 --> 01:13:05,755
Shade sounds great.

922
01:13:08,934 --> 01:13:10,731
Oh!

923
01:13:16,808 --> 01:13:18,833
- Oh, Nancy.
- Osh.

924
01:13:18,911 --> 01:13:22,244
I've just remembered where
old Mrs. Hamilton's picture was hid.

925
01:13:22,314 --> 01:13:26,546
- Oh, where is she?
- Since I mislaid Mr. Hamilton's letter,

926
01:13:26,618 --> 01:13:28,882
I ain't been able to sleep nights.

927
01:13:28,954 --> 01:13:31,855
Then driving over here,
it came to me like a ray of light.

928
01:13:33,325 --> 01:13:35,384
She's in there!

929
01:13:35,460 --> 01:13:38,987
- In the Dutch oven?
- Just like the letter said.

930
01:13:39,998 --> 01:13:45,129
- Funny place to put your mother.
- The Dutch oven is cool and dry.

931
01:13:45,203 --> 01:13:49,230
Wouldn't have harmed the old lady
if she'd been put in there alive.

932
01:13:49,308 --> 01:13:51,503
You'll be out soon!

933
01:13:53,512 --> 01:13:56,481
A dear little gold football.

934
01:13:57,816 --> 01:14:00,284
And to think that you won it!

935
01:14:01,520 --> 01:14:03,852
Please tell me all about it.

936
01:14:05,123 --> 01:14:08,251
Oh, that was the game
when Dartmouth fumbled on our...

937
01:14:08,327 --> 01:14:10,659
Well, I wondered where everybody was.

938
01:14:10,729 --> 01:14:14,688
What do you have there, Julia?
A football!

939
01:14:15,400 --> 01:14:20,838
"Brown University. Charles Bryant."
Brown...

940
01:14:23,375 --> 01:14:27,368
You must be Bandy Bryant!
I've seen you play!

941
01:14:27,446 --> 01:14:31,075
You retrieved the ball
on the five-yard line, ran 90...

942
01:14:31,149 --> 01:14:33,617
He knows what he did, Nancy.

943
01:14:33,685 --> 01:14:38,748
I like to relive it. It was a glorious
moment in the great American scene.

944
01:14:41,293 --> 01:14:44,729
- Mr. Bryant...
- Here we have a renowned athlete

945
01:14:44,796 --> 01:14:46,161
sitting under a tree!

946
01:14:46,231 --> 01:14:48,893
You're probably dying to be
batting at something.

947
01:14:48,967 --> 01:14:52,095
- Oh, well, I...
- I don't play football

948
01:14:52,170 --> 01:14:55,003
but how about a game of croquet?

949
01:14:56,541 --> 01:14:58,168
Fine.

950
01:15:03,515 --> 01:15:05,710
I can't wait till school begins.

951
01:15:05,784 --> 01:15:08,617
I shall be taking literature.

952
01:15:12,824 --> 01:15:15,384
- I have another turn now, Mr. Bryant?
- Yes.

953
01:15:16,928 --> 01:15:19,192
I think I'll try for Julia.

954
01:15:31,143 --> 01:15:33,771
- Your turn, Miss Julia.
- Oh...

955
01:15:35,547 --> 01:15:39,381
Oh, dear. Nancy's so athletic.

956
01:15:43,422 --> 01:15:45,890
- What am I doing wrong?
- May I?

957
01:15:48,560 --> 01:15:50,926
Put that hand there. That one there.

958
01:15:50,996 --> 01:15:54,523
Now you have a good chance
to knock me away from the wicket.

959
01:15:54,599 --> 01:15:56,863
Oh, I couldn't do that!

960
01:15:56,935 --> 01:16:00,166
It's part of the game. Hit him!

961
01:16:02,774 --> 01:16:04,867
No, no.

962
01:16:04,943 --> 01:16:06,774
Like this.

963
01:16:06,845 --> 01:16:08,540
That's right.

964
01:16:10,348 --> 01:16:13,579
Oh, I really can't hit you, Mr. Bryant.

965
01:16:13,652 --> 01:16:16,917
Oh, for the love of Pete,
it's part of the game.

966
01:16:16,988 --> 01:16:18,956
Is it?

967
01:16:27,833 --> 01:16:31,360
Nice shot, Miss Julia...
if a little out of bounds.

968
01:17:33,665 --> 01:17:35,496
I won!

969
01:17:38,670 --> 01:17:40,069
I won?

970
01:17:47,746 --> 01:17:52,206
<i># Three creaky wooden stairs</i>

971

Well, after all the time
she took primping!

1009
01:21:16,621 --> 01:21:20,421
She could have at least
hung up her clothes.

1010
01:21:20,492 --> 01:21:24,451
What does she think she is?
A guest in this house or something?

1011
01:21:26,931 --> 01:21:31,834
<i># Hold your hand</i>

1012
01:21:32,570 --> 01:21:34,902
Oh, I thought you'd be in bed.

1013
01:21:37,475 --> 01:21:39,670
With your stuff piled all over it?

1014
01:21:40,745 --> 01:21:43,942
- You left this place like a pigsty.
- Did I?

1015
01:21:45,316 --> 01:21:48,444
Oh, you know,
there's nothing like a college man.

1016
01:21:50,588 --> 01:21:53,386
Oh, I do hope you and your mother
will scrape and save

1017
01:21:53,458 --> 01:21:55,653
to get Gilly into a good college.

1018
01:21:55,727 --> 01:21:59,026
Give one member of this family
a chance to amount to something.

1019
01:22:01,132 --> 01:22:03,532
- What did you say?
- I said...

1020
01:22:03,601 --> 01:22:05,068
I heard you.

1021
01:22:05,136 --> 01:22:07,969
I want you to know, Julia Carey,
you make me sick.

1022
01:22:08,039 --> 01:22:13,534
I'm sick of Gladys Ferguson's clothes
and her French maid and her lace and...

1023
01:22:13,611 --> 01:22:16,842
I'm just sick of all that blah blah blah
about the Fergusons.

1024
01:22:16,915 --> 01:22:20,282
Oh, that's right. Tear my dress.
Pull the buttons right off.

1025
01:22:20,351 --> 01:22:22,342
It's only imported.

1026
01:22:23,054 --> 01:22:25,318
Oh, you're very imported.

1027
01:22:25,390 --> 01:22:28,416
But I'm tired of doing your share
and picking up after you.

1028
01:22:28,493 --> 01:22:31,394
- Don't pick up after me.
- I won't.

1029
01:22:39,070 --> 01:22:44,940
Imported chemise. French silk.
Handmade shirt waist. English Lisle.

1030
01:22:45,009 --> 01:22:49,639
Crepe de Chine drawers. No, they weren't
over there, they were over there.

1031
01:22:49,714 --> 01:22:52,444
Oh, I know what's wrong with you.
You're jealous.

1032
01:22:53,151 --> 01:22:56,746
Jealous? Me, jealous? Oh!

1033
01:22:56,821 --> 01:22:58,482
Why yes, because of Charles.

1034
01:22:59,824 --> 01:23:02,258
Oh, so it's "Charles" now, is it?

1035
01:23:09,134 --> 01:23:12,865
"Oh, Mr. Bryant.
I couldn't hit your croquet ball."

1036
01:23:12,937 --> 01:23:14,802
"I'm too weak and dainty."

1037
01:23:14,873 --> 01:23:20,209
"But I might take a weensy push
at Big Jim Jeffries-Nancy Carey's ball."

1038
01:23:20,879 --> 01:23:21,868
Whack!

1039
01:23:21,946 --> 01:23:26,645
"Mercy! I only sent her 100 yards,
but I couldn't hit you."

1040
01:23:26,718 --> 01:23:27,844
Hilarious.

1041
01:23:27,919 --> 01:23:30,581
If you knew how you look
pretending to be dumb.

1042
01:23:30,655 --> 01:23:32,589
- I am dumb.
- Oh, no, you're not.

1043
01:23:32,657 --> 01:23:34,818
- I am so.
- Ha, ha.

1044
01:23:34,893 --> 01:23:37,123
Oh, I can see it's no use
trying to talk to you.

1045
01:23:37,195 --> 01:23:41,188
You're a child, a jealous child,
growing up like a hoodlum.

1046
01:23:41,266 --> 01:23:43,496
The Fergusons
might make a lady of you.

1047
01:23:43,568 --> 01:23:46,696
- My mother hasn't?
- She hasn't succeeded.

1048
01:23:46,771 --> 01:23:50,673
Why don't you go back to the Fergusons?
They're so wonderful.

1049
01:23:50,742 --> 01:23:54,234
Oh, sure. They dumped you here with us.
They didn't care.

1050
01:23:54,312 --> 01:23:56,371
George Ferguson only raised you

1051
01:23:56,447 --> 01:24:00,383
'cause he felt guilty
when he lost all your father's money.

1052
01:24:00,451 --> 01:24:03,943
If he hadn't lost my father's money,
my mother might have a French maid

1053
01:24:04,022 --> 01:24:07,321
and I could have imported dresses
and Gilly go to college.

1054
01:24:07,392 --> 01:24:11,055
- I don't believe you.
- Oh, Julia!

1055
01:24:12,163 --> 01:24:13,994
I'm sorry. I...

1056
01:24:20,438 --> 01:24:24,431
Aunt Margaret!
Is what Nancy told me true?

1057
01:24:24,509 --> 01:24:27,637
- What's the matter?
- Mother, I've done a terrible thing.

1058
01:24:27,712 --> 01:24:29,976
I was mad at her
and it just slipped out.

1059
01:24:30,048 --> 01:24:32,039
Tell her what you said.

1060
01:24:34,219 --> 01:24:36,744
Oh, Mother, you know what I said.

1061
01:24:36,821 --> 01:24:39,585
Nancy, how could you?

1062
01:24:40,391 --> 01:24:41,619
Julia, really, I...

1063
01:24:41,693 --> 01:24:44,890
No matter what Nancy says,
the Fergusons love me.

1064
01:24:44,963 --> 01:24:47,431
Of course they do.

1065
01:24:48,099 --> 01:24:50,533
And we love you too, Julia.

1066
01:24:53,104 --> 01:24:56,835
And, dear,
I've had a letter from George Ferguson.

1067
01:24:57,475 --> 01:25:00,308
He writes that his affairs
are looking brighter now,

1068
01:25:00,378 --> 01:25:02,812
and they're ready to take you back.

1069
01:25:06,117 --> 01:25:07,709
Take me back?

1070
01:25:07,785 --> 01:25:09,776
I've put off telling you

1071
01:25:09,854 --> 01:25:14,882
because I hoped you'd care for us
as much as we care for you.

1072
01:25:15,526 --> 01:25:17,517
But it has to be your choice.

1073
01:25:17,595 --> 01:25:19,961
Oh, please choose us, Julia.

1074
01:25:24,702 --> 01:25:26,761
I do.

1075
01:25:26,838 --> 01:25:28,829
Oh, Aunt Margaret.

1076
01:25:30,074 --> 01:25:33,510
I don't want to go back! I'm happy here.

1077
01:25:33,578 --> 01:25:36,877
- Please let me stay.
- Please, Mother.

1078
01:25:37,582 --> 01:25:39,311
Oh, of course.

1079
01:25:43,421 --> 01:25:46,322
- Oh, Nancy!
- Julia.

1080
01:25:46,391 --> 01:25:47,790
It's all been my fault.

1081
01:25:47,859 --> 01:25:51,818
I'll do my share and I'll never mention
the Fergusons again.

1082
01:25:51,896 --> 01:25:55,992
Oh, and my dresses. They
weren't imported. I made them myself.

1083
01:25:56,067 --> 01:25:57,500
You did?

1084
01:25:57,568 --> 01:26:02,631
If I do all the dishes, will you help me
with my dress for the housewarming?

1085
01:26:02,707 --> 01:26:05,642
When it comes to sewing, I'm all thumbs.

1086
01:26:05,710 --> 01:26:09,305
I have the most wonderful
book of patterns. Gladys Fer...

1087
01:26:09,380 --> 01:26:12,474
I mean, it's from Paris.
The latest styles.

1088
01:26:12,550 --> 01:26:14,677
Really? A Paris gown!

1089
01:26:17,255 --> 01:26:19,883
Good night... sisters.

1090
01:26:22,360 --> 01:26:25,158
That's the best one you've done.

1091
01:26:27,398 --> 01:26:30,231
Who are you bringing
to the dance tonight, Dig?

1092
01:26:30,301 --> 01:26:35,170
- Opal.
- Opal? I never heard of her.

1093
01:26:35,239 --> 01:26:40,472
- Must be one of your city giris.
- She lives on the other side of Beulah.

1094
01:26:40,545 --> 01:26:44,538
I've known her since
about the first grade.

1095
01:26:44,615 --> 01:26:48,346
Funny thing. I always used to think
she was kinda clunky.

1096
01:26:48,419 --> 01:26:52,014
Till I met some of those city giris.
You can have 'em.

1097
01:26:56,494 --> 01:26:59,952
Gee, Dig.
You liked the city, didn't you?

1098
01:27:00,031 --> 01:27:04,695
Well, it's like Pa always says.
The city is all right for city folks.

1099
01:27:04,769 --> 01:27:08,227
Second night I was there,
I wished I was back in Beulah.

1100
01:27:09,440 --> 01:27:11,340
Why?

1101
01:27:11,409 --> 01:27:13,843
I was walking along the streets

1102
01:27:13,911 --> 01:27:16,744
and all these people were rushing by me.

1103
01:27:16,814 --> 01:27:20,045
And they looked like... like ants.

1104
01:27:20,118 --> 01:27:25,420
I could no more talk to one of them
than I could talk to an ant.

1105
01:27:27,425 --> 01:27:29,450
Well, it's great you're home.

1106
01:27:31,129 --> 01:27:34,565
I guess you'll be wanting your job back,
driving the truck.

1107
01:27:35,500 --> 01:27:39,129
No, I got a good offer to work
down at the sawmill.

1108
01:27:39,203 --> 01:27:41,797
So the job's still yours.

1109
01:27:41,873 --> 01:27:43,864
Gee, thanks!

1110
01:27:44,742 --> 01:27:48,143
Well, we'd better be getting
the rest of that stuff up here.

1111
01:27:50,248 --> 01:27:53,046
I remember, the night before I left...

1112
01:27:54,252 --> 01:27:59,849
I was talking to Pa about wanting to see
city lights and the gals and all.

1113
01:27:59,924 --> 01:28:02,017
You know what he said to me?

1114
01:28:04,495 --> 01:28:09,330
Pa said, "'Mid pleasures and palaces,

1115
01:28:09,400 --> 01:28:11,493
wherever you may roam,

1116
01:28:11,569 --> 01:28:15,061
be it ever so humble,
there's no place like home."

1117
01:28:15,740 --> 01:28:18,903
- He sang it?
- No, he said it.

1118
01:28:19,677 --> 01:28:21,975
He made it right up.

1119
01:28:23,347 --> 01:28:28,478
You know, Gil, if Pa had felt like it,
he would have made a great poet.

1120
01:28:29,821 --> 01:28:31,618
Yeah.

1121
01:28:41,199 --> 01:28:43,224
Peter! No!

1122
01:28:44,802 --> 01:28:47,498
I was just trying to see
what Mrs. Hamilton looks like.

1123
01:28:47,572 --> 01:28:51,531
Not till tonight at the ceremony,
as we promised Osh.

1124
01:28:51,609 --> 01:28:55,705
Where are those giris? Don't they
realize we have a million things to do?

1125
01:28:55,780 --> 01:28:58,112
You go back and carve your pumpkin.

1126
01:29:00,218 --> 01:29:02,652
I wish I was dead!

1127
01:29:02,720 --> 01:29:05,416
Lallie Joy,
why do you wish you were dead?

1128
01:29:06,924 --> 01:29:10,018
- Look at it!
- Oh, my goodness!

1129
01:29:10,094 --> 01:29:13,495
- Lallie Joy!
- Where did you dig that up?

1130
01:29:14,532 --> 01:29:18,366
Ma made it. I'll just die
if I have to wear it to the party.

1131
01:29:18,436 --> 01:29:23,339
Oh, it's not so bad. We'll just make
a few changes and it'll be all right.

1132
01:29:23,407 --> 01:29:26,808
- Sure.
- You don't need this.

1133
01:29:26,878 --> 01:29:29,278
Right. Get rid of these.

1134
01:29:29,347 --> 01:29:32,612
- That's all too...
- Oh! My chest shows!

1135
01:29:32,683 --> 01:29:35,117
Too bunchy here.

1136
01:29:35,186 --> 01:29:38,053
- All right. Out of it.
- Oh, there's nothing to it.

1137
01:29:38,122 --> 01:29:41,182
We'll just have to start all over again,
that's all.

1138
01:29:41,259 --> 01:29:44,285
Oh, my dress! What will Ma say?

1139
01:29:44,362 --> 01:29:48,458
Oh, don't worry about the dress.
It's what's inside that counts.

Oh, Gilly, why don't you
look where you're going?

01:31:39,777 --> 01:31:42,405
I'm sorry.
I suppose I should have been looking.

01:31:42,480 --> 01:31:44,505
Oh, I thought you were
my brother, Gilly.

I hope I'm not intruding on anything.

Oh, no. No.

1174
01:31:48,986 --> 01:31:52,183
You see, we're having a party
tonight in the barn.

1175
01:31:52,256 --> 01:31:55,020
Paying a tribute
to Mr. Hamilton's dear old mother.

1176
01:31:55,092 --> 01:31:56,559
Oh.

1177
01:31:56,627 --> 01:31:59,289
It's the least we could do.
He owns the place.

1178
01:31:59,363 --> 01:32:01,456
Oh, he does?

1179
01:32:01,532 --> 01:32:04,365
Mm. Not that he ever cared much
about it.

1180
01:32:04,435 --> 01:32:07,962
You should have seen the mess it was in
before we took over.

1181
01:32:08,039 --> 01:32:11,065
- Took over?
- From Mr. Hamilton.

1182
01:32:11,142 --> 01:32:14,703
He gave us carte blanche,
so this is a housewarming.

1183
01:32:14,779 --> 01:32:18,476
- A huge affair. Everyone's coming.
- Nancy!

1184
01:32:18,549 --> 01:32:22,110
- Right there, Mother.
- Well, I mustn't keep you.

1185
01:32:24,055 --> 01:32:26,615
I don't suppose
you're stopping over in Beulah.

1186
01:32:26,691 --> 01:32:30,320
- Well, I hadn't...
- I guess not. It's just a little town.

1187
01:32:30,394 --> 01:32:33,363
- Nancy.
- I think someone's calling you.

1188
01:32:33,431 --> 01:32:35,422
Careful of the wheel.

1189
01:32:42,707 --> 01:32:44,902
About this thing tonight.
It's open house.

1190
01:32:44,975 --> 01:32:47,443
Terribly open.
To anyone who wants to come.

1191
01:32:47,511 --> 01:32:49,911
Friends, acquaintances, total strangers.

1192
01:32:49,980 --> 01:32:52,540
It should be a very interesting party.
Have fun.

1193
01:32:52,616 --> 01:32:54,345
- Bye.
- Bye.

1194
01:33:03,461 --> 01:33:07,795
Nancy! For the last time,
we're waiting for all those things.

1195
01:33:32,890 --> 01:33:35,381
- Ahem.
- Be with you in a minute.

1196
01:33:35,459 --> 01:33:37,586
Quite all right. Thank you.

1197
01:33:37,661 --> 01:33:40,095
Important letter to a friend of mine.

1198
01:33:41,599 --> 01:33:43,590
Rich property owner here.

1199
01:33:44,735 --> 01:33:46,794
He lives in China.

1200
01:33:48,205 --> 01:33:51,800
Leaves me in complete charge
of his affairs.

1201
01:33:51,876 --> 01:33:53,867
Big responsibility.

1202
01:33:55,012 --> 01:33:57,537
I've got to get this here off
to Mr. Hamilton.

1203
01:33:58,783 --> 01:34:00,774
Then I'll take it.

1204
01:34:03,487 --> 01:34:07,184
Tom Hamilton?
Well, I didn't know you for a minute.

1205
01:34:10,828 --> 01:34:15,026
Well. Didn't know you was coming back.
You gave me quite a shock.

1206
01:34:15,766 --> 01:34:19,293
Thank you.
Um... I just drove by the yellow house.

1207
01:34:19,370 --> 01:34:21,702
There's some people out there.

1208
01:34:21,772 --> 01:34:24,741
Yes. Lovely folks by the name of Carey
has been living there.

1209
01:34:24,809 --> 01:34:27,437
I see. How long
have they been living there, Osh?

1210
01:34:27,511 --> 01:34:30,173
Well, not long, as you figure time.

1211
01:34:30,247 --> 01:34:32,374
Wonderful folks, the Careys.

1212
01:34:32,449 --> 01:34:35,111
They put in a new chain pump
for that old wooden one.

1213
01:34:35,186 --> 01:34:37,950
Who gave them permissión
to live there?

1214
01:34:38,022 --> 01:34:40,820
- You did.
- I did?

1215
01:34:40,891 --> 01:34:43,621
I've never even heard of them.
Nobody asked me.

1216
01:34:43,694 --> 01:34:46,254
- Why didn't you write?
- Well, I did.

1217
01:34:48,833 --> 01:34:51,097
Yes, sir. I did.

1218
01:34:51,168 --> 01:34:52,635
I wrote you every week

1219
01:34:52,703 --> 01:34:56,161
and kept you abreast
of everything that was happening.

1220
01:34:56,240 --> 01:34:59,107
- I didn't get any letters.
- That's right.

1221
01:34:59,176 --> 01:35:02,236
You see, I didn't mail them.

1222
01:35:02,313 --> 01:35:04,213
Popham, what's going on?

1223
01:35:04,281 --> 01:35:06,476
Now just wait. Just hear me out.

1224
01:35:06,550 --> 01:35:09,917
You see, I didn't know
how you'd take the situation

1225
01:35:09,987 --> 01:35:13,514
and here was these nice folks
that needed a house

1226
01:35:13,591 --> 01:35:18,995
and they fell plum in love with yours
and I let them have it.

1227
01:35:19,063 --> 01:35:21,497
I wrote you all about it.

1228
01:35:22,600 --> 01:35:26,866
Put 'em up here,
where Mariah wasn't likely to look.

1229
01:35:27,938 --> 01:35:31,465
Here they are. The lot of them.

1230
01:35:31,542 --> 01:35:36,502
The ones I wrote and the ones that
Nancy Carey wrote you. Hers are on top.

1231
01:35:36,580 --> 01:35:41,313
I wrote you because Mariah
was nagging me to get your permissión.

1232
01:35:41,385 --> 01:35:44,718
Nancy wrote hers
from a grateful young heart.

1233
01:35:46,056 --> 01:35:50,550
I hope you read hers before you
make up your mind what you've got to do.

1234
01:36:13,117 --> 01:36:15,108
Who's that, Mr. Popham?

1235
01:36:16,320 --> 01:36:20,814
Mariah, for once in your life,
pray for a silver lining.

1236
01:36:30,734 --> 01:36:33,032
Mother, must I?

1237
01:36:33,103 --> 01:36:35,003
Yes, Gilly, you must.

1238
01:36:35,072 --> 01:36:36,767
Osh has been our true friend

1239
01:36:36,840 --> 01:36:41,436
and he was pleased when he learned
you'd be Lallie Joy's partner tonight.

1240
01:36:41,512 --> 01:36:44,242
Lallie Joy, Gilly's waiting.

1241
01:36:47,017 --> 01:36:50,418
- Remember now. Walk feminine.
- Talk feminine.

1242
01:36:51,889 --> 01:36:53,186
Go on!

1243
01:37:24,755 --> 01:37:26,814
Good evening, Gilly.

1244
01:37:34,598 --> 01:37:36,793
- Good evening, Mr. Bryant.
- Lallie Joy.

1245
01:37:39,770 --> 01:37:41,704
- Good evening, Charles.
- Mrs. Carey.

1246
01:37:41,772 --> 01:37:44,969
- Won't you come in?
- Charles! How's my hair?

1247
01:37:45,042 --> 01:37:47,135
- Fine.
- Well, how do I look?

1248
01:37:47,211 --> 01:37:49,611
Fine. But you said
you should keep a man waiting.

1249
01:37:49,680 --> 01:37:55,050
Oh, did I say that?
Nancy, dear, you'll understand some day.

1250
01:37:55,119 --> 01:37:57,383
You've got plenty of time.

1251
01:38:07,331 --> 01:38:12,098
- I didn't think you'd even be ready.
- I'll never keep you waiting, Charles.

1252
01:38:27,751 --> 01:38:32,882
- Hi, Julia. Opal, this is Julia.
- How do you do, Julia?

1253
01:38:32,956 --> 01:38:35,254
Hello, Mr. Bryant.

1254
01:38:35,325 --> 01:38:39,125
No use standing around out here.
Party's inside.

1255
01:38:47,037 --> 01:38:50,905
Nancy? Nancy?
Everyone's over at the barn.

1256
01:38:50,974 --> 01:38:54,307
These slippers, Mother.
I told you they'd be too big.

1257
01:38:55,212 --> 01:38:57,578
Well, I'd hoped you'd grow into them.

1258
01:38:57,648 --> 01:39:00,139
Oh, Mother,
you still think of me as a child.

1259
01:39:01,085 --> 01:39:03,610
I suppose I do.

1260
01:39:03,687 --> 01:39:06,019
Anyway, your guests are waiting.

1261
01:39:06,090 --> 01:39:07,990
A fine little fixer I am.

1262
01:39:08,058 --> 01:39:11,926
Everybody has somebody.
Not me, though.

1263
01:39:11,995 --> 01:39:14,429
Not me. Uh... not I.

1264
01:39:14,765 --> 01:39:17,359
There are plenty of young people.
You can join them.

1265
01:39:17,434 --> 01:39:19,299
Join?

1266
01:39:19,369 --> 01:39:21,803
It isn't the same thing, Mother.

1267
01:39:21,872 --> 01:39:24,966
I wouldn't have minded a year ago.
Even a month.

1268
01:39:26,043 --> 01:39:28,534
But... I don't know.

1269
01:39:28,612 --> 01:39:32,571
Somehow, I just have
a different feeling, that's all.

1270
01:39:32,649 --> 01:39:36,449
Well, if you don't want to go in alone,
I'll send Gilly over.

1271
01:39:36,520 --> 01:39:39,717
Mother! Gilly's a relative.

1272
01:39:39,790 --> 01:39:42,953
I couldn't go into the ballroom
with a relative.

1273
01:39:43,026 --> 01:39:47,588
No, I must go alone. I must do it alone.

1274
01:39:47,664 --> 01:39:49,791
Well, if you're sure.

1275
01:39:49,867 --> 01:39:52,097
Florence Nightingale. The Crimea.

1276
01:39:52,169 --> 01:39:54,865
Joan of Arc. Maid of Orleans.

1277
01:39:54,938 --> 01:39:57,099
Mrs. Pankhurst. Votes for women.

1278
01:39:58,108 --> 01:40:01,305
Don't take too long
deciding which one you want to be.

1279
01:40:05,549 --> 01:40:07,676
Chin up.

1280
01:40:07,751 --> 01:40:09,742
Smiling, the boy fell dead.

1281
01:40:09,820 --> 01:40:13,278
Boy?! Oh, no, never!

1282
01:40:13,357 --> 01:40:15,757
I'd much rather...

1283
01:40:15,826 --> 01:40:18,852
<i># Walk feminine, talk feminine</i>

1284
01:40:18,929 --> 01:40:22,729
<i># Smile and beguile feminine... #</i>

1285
01:40:52,396 --> 01:40:54,626
Oh, allow me, please.

1286
01:41:01,071 --> 01:41:03,266
I brought along a friend of mine, Nancy.

1287
01:41:03,340 --> 01:41:05,831
- I don't think you know Tom...
- Oh, we've met.

1288
01:41:08,078 --> 01:41:11,275
I decided I couldn't afford
to miss this party.

1289
01:41:11,348 --> 01:41:14,749
Should be a very um...
interesting evening.

1290
01:41:17,921 --> 01:41:23,052
Well, to think that you know Osh Popham,
the most remarkable human being.

1291
01:41:23,126 --> 01:41:24,753
Fairy godfather.

1292
01:41:24,828 --> 01:41:27,991
If it hadn't been for him,
we wouldn't be in this lovely house.

1293
01:41:28,065 --> 01:41:30,863
I don't think Mr. Popham told me
the whole story.

1294
01:41:30,934 --> 01:41:34,062
Oh, I know. He's so modest.
Self-effacing.

1295
01:41:34,137 --> 01:41:36,401
So I'll start at the beginning.

1296
01:41:38,208 --> 01:41:40,142
Where was I? Oh, yes, I remember.

1297
01:41:41,745 --> 01:41:44,543
Well, it was Osh, Osh, Osh,
from the very start.

1298
01:41:44,615 --> 01:41:47,516
From the first moment we arrived...

1299
01:42:16,113 --> 01:42:19,048
- Evening, Clove.
- Well, evening, cousin.

1300
01:42:20,350 --> 01:42:24,616
Say, you're looking worse
than I ever seen you.

1301
01:42:24,688 --> 01:42:26,952
I am worse. I'm horrible.

1302
01:42:27,024 --> 01:42:31,120
Well, that's not a fit mood
for you to be in for a party.

1303
01:42:31,194 --> 01:42:34,789
I've got some nice applejack here.

1304
01:42:34,865 --> 01:42:36,890
This will fix you up fine.

1305
01:42:38,201 --> 01:42:42,160
There now. Take a swig of this.

1306
01:42:43,707 --> 01:42:48,406
Pull you right out of yourself.
Here's to the state of Maine.

1307
01:42:52,482 --> 01:42:55,451
Good evening. How are you?

1308
01:42:55,519 --> 01:43:00,422
Nice to have you with us.
Digby. Lallie Joy.

1309
01:43:00,490 --> 01:43:03,653
Oh, there's dear Osh.

1310
01:43:03,727 --> 01:43:05,718
- Who's that?
- I never saw him before.

1311
01:43:05,796 --> 01:43:07,764
City fella.

1312
01:43:10,233 --> 01:43:13,828
Osh. You two stay together. It's time
for Mother to start the ceremonies.

1313
01:43:15,739 --> 01:43:18,173
Oh, yes. The ceremonies.

1314
01:43:18,241 --> 01:43:20,709
It won't amount to much.
It'll be kind of dull.

1315
01:43:21,411 --> 01:43:23,504
- Like to go out for a smoke?
- No.

1316
01:43:24,948 --> 01:43:26,973
I'm sure that I'll enjoy them.

1317
01:43:33,190 --> 01:43:35,624
Will you gather closer, please?

1318
01:43:41,498 --> 01:43:43,989
Friends and neighbors.

1319
01:43:44,067 --> 01:43:47,969
As you know, the Carey family
would not be living in the yellow house

1320
01:43:48,038 --> 01:43:52,202
if it were not for the generosity
of Mr. Thomas Hamilton.

1321
01:43:52,876 --> 01:43:55,743
He has made but one modest request,

1322
01:43:55,812 --> 01:43:58,576
that we hang the portrait
of his beloved mother

1323
01:43:58,648 --> 01:44:00,309
in a place of honor.

1324
01:44:05,389 --> 01:44:09,257
- Mr. Popham!
- Mariah. Don't say it.

1325
01:44:09,326 --> 01:44:14,662
- You look near to apoplexy.
- Mr. Popham!

1326
01:44:14,731 --> 01:44:18,792
Calm yourself. Here. Drink this.
And then I'll listen to you.

1327
01:44:27,611 --> 01:44:31,445
And now may I present
my daughter, Nancy,

1328
01:44:31,515 --> 01:44:34,951
who will unveil this lovely portrait.

1329
01:44:36,753 --> 01:44:39,313
- Where's Peter?
- I won't!

1330
01:44:41,691 --> 01:44:44,683
I won't! I won't do it!

1331
01:44:44,761 --> 01:44:46,695
I won't!

1332
01:44:50,467 --> 01:44:54,426
Mr. Hamilton,
wherever you may be,

1333
01:44:54,504 --> 01:44:58,770
ankle-deep in fetid rice paddies
or splendid in a gay rickshaw,

1334
01:44:58,842 --> 01:45:03,336
delirious with fever,
or sated with oriental dances,

1335
01:45:03,413 --> 01:45:06,109
we know your heart is with us tonight.

1336
01:45:06,183 --> 01:45:08,344
Amen.

1337
01:45:12,122 --> 01:45:15,216
Tonight, we're unveiling your mother,
as per your request.

1338
01:45:15,292 --> 01:45:19,592
We have taken her from the oven where
she's been hidden for so many years...

1339
01:45:19,663 --> 01:45:23,224
- Funny place, the oven.
- His mother?

1340
01:45:23,300 --> 01:45:26,599
Of course we're not going to
keep her hanging in the barn.

1341
01:45:26,670 --> 01:45:28,695
No, we're gonna find a permanent place

1342
01:45:28,772 --> 01:45:32,435
where she'll always be enshrined
in our hearts.

1343
01:45:32,509 --> 01:45:36,775
No doubt some of you have heard me
kidding about old Mr. Hamilton,

1344
01:45:36,847 --> 01:45:39,315
calling him the Yellow Peril...

1345
01:45:41,485 --> 01:45:45,114
Well, that was only because
I thought that maybe the old gentleman

1346
01:45:45,188 --> 01:45:50,023
might suddenly return, and snatch
the yellow house right away from us.

1347
01:45:51,828 --> 01:45:53,853
Peter?

1348
01:45:57,133 --> 01:46:02,366
To light these candles, I give you
a twig of rosemary... for remembrance.

1349
01:46:09,913 --> 01:46:12,245
This is a very special mother.

1350
01:46:12,315 --> 01:46:16,945
Ladies and gentlemen, dear friends...
Mr. Hamilton's mother.

1351
01:46:28,932 --> 01:46:31,196
She was a good woman.

1352
01:46:47,384 --> 01:46:50,876
Just where did you dig up that thing?

1353
01:46:50,954 --> 01:46:53,650
Reminds me, I forgot to ask.
How is your mother?

1354
01:46:53,723 --> 01:46:55,816
She's fine.
Having a whirl on the Riviera.

1355
01:46:55,892 --> 01:46:58,326
She wouldn't live in Beulah
if you gave it to her.

1356
01:46:58,395 --> 01:47:00,886
That's why Father
left the yellow house to me.

1357
01:47:06,536 --> 01:47:08,504
What are you going to do?

1358
01:47:08,572 --> 01:47:10,733
Oh, I'll see you later.

1359
01:47:19,182 --> 01:47:21,275
There you are.
Did you enjoy the ceremony?

1360
01:47:21,351 --> 01:47:24,218
- Well, sort of.
- I must admit her face was a shock.

1361
01:47:24,287 --> 01:47:27,222
Yes, it was a bit of a shock to me, too.

1362
01:47:27,857 --> 01:47:30,553
But I'm sure she has a heart of gold,
don't you, Mr...

1363
01:47:30,627 --> 01:47:33,960
- I'm sure.
- I don't think Osh told me your name.

1364
01:47:34,030 --> 01:47:36,362
Hamilton. Tom Hamilton.

1365
01:47:36,433 --> 01:47:38,901
Hamilton.

1366
01:47:38,969 --> 01:47:41,802
That's a familiar sounding name.

1367
01:47:42,872 --> 01:47:46,569
- Tom Hamilton.
- Tom Hamilton.

1368
01:47:47,644 --> 01:47:50,044
Any relation to...

1369
01:47:51,615 --> 01:47:54,516
- Close?
- Very close.

1370
01:47:55,986 --> 01:47:58,250
Not our Mr. Hamilton?

1371
01:47:58,321 --> 01:48:00,289
Not the Yellow Peril Hamilton?

1372
01:48:00,357 --> 01:48:03,884
Well, I think you look
more like a Yellow Peril.

1373
01:48:03,960 --> 01:48:06,292
Uh... what are you going to do to me?

1374
01:48:06,363 --> 01:48:09,924
Right now? Dance with you.

01:48:13,870 --> 01:48:16,361
- And don't talk.
- Wasn't going to.

1376
01:48:22,245 --> 01:48:26,841
Well, Mariah, looks like
that black cloud has a silver lining.

1377
01:48:28,051 --> 01:48:32,511
Didn't I tell you? Everything
always turns out all right in the end.
