<i>I've something to sing about now</i>

3
00:02:03,102 --> 00:02:07,502
<i>and I want the world to know
just why the moon's aglow</i>

4
00:02:07,503 --> 00:02:11,203
<i>...why stars are winking up above.</i>

5
00:02:11,204 --> 00:02:14,504
<i>I'm in love.</i>

6
00:02:16,205 --> 00:02:19,805
<i>I've something to sing about now.</i>

7
00:02:20,506 --> 00:02:25,206
<i>My heart is so full of song,
just couldn't hold it long</i>

8
00:02:25,207 --> 00:02:28,407
<i>I want to brag a little love.</i>

9
00:02:28,408 --> 00:02:31,008
<i> I'm in love.</i>

10
00:02:33,109 --> 00:02:37,009
<i>I never knew why the robin spent hours</i>

11
00:02:37,010 --> 00:02:41,810
<i>singing sweet little ditties to the flowers.</i>

12
00:02:41,811 --> 00:02:46,411
<i> I thought he sang just because it was spring
la di da...</i>

13
00:02:46,412 --> 00:02:51,012
<i>but now I know it was love
for I have felt the same thing.</i>

14
00:02:51,013 --> 00:02:55,703
<i>I've something to sing about love.</i>

15
00:02:55,704 --> 00:03:00,304
<i>And someday I'm gonna try singing a lullaby</i>

16
00:03:00,305 --> 00:03:04,205
<i>Who said that heaven's up above?</i>

17
00:03:04,206 --> 00:03:10,106
<i>I'm in love.</i>

18
00:03:18,507 --> 00:03:22,207
And that was Tina Wyatt, featured vocalist
with Terry Rooney and his orchestra.

19
00:03:22,208 --> 00:03:24,808
And now it's time to say goodbye
to our old friend Terry.

20
00:03:24,809 --> 00:03:28,209
In a few hours Terry will be
on his way to Hollywood to make a picture.

21
00:03:28,310 --> 00:03:31,100
Good luck, Terry,
and success to you as a movie star.

22
00:03:34,801 --> 00:03:36,701
Goodbye, Terry.
Goodbye, Charlie.

23
00:03:36,702 --> 00:03:39,202
Goodbye, Terry. Gee, I'm sorry to see you go.

24
00:03:39,203 --> 00:03:41,603
What's the use of my sticking around here
when he won't give you a night off?

25
00:03:41,604 --> 00:03:44,104
I'm glad to see you go.
But I'll be back.

26
00:03:44,105 --> 00:03:47,105
Bye, Terry and all kinds of good luck to you.
Goodbye, Joe.

27
00:03:51,206 --> 00:03:53,606
Are we off the air, Mac?
Yep, it's all yours, Terry.

28
00:03:54,507 --> 00:03:56,407
Thanks, friends, for a wonderful send-off.

29
00:03:56,408 --> 00:03:59,708
As you probably know, Hollywood calls.

30
00:03:59,709 --> 00:04:03,109
And I'm about to trade close-ups
with Montgomery and Taylor...

31
00:04:03,110 --> 00:04:04,410
and uh...

32
00:04:04,411 --> 00:04:06,711
that other big good-looking fellow,
you know, er... I mean...

33
00:04:07,212 --> 00:04:08,712
uh, Gable.

34
00:04:08,213 --> 00:04:12,013
and, uh, may the best profile win.

35
00:04:14,414 --> 00:04:16,214
And now, by way of saying goodbye...

36
00:04:17,615 --> 00:04:19,015
Hit it, you cats!

37
00:06:32,616 --> 00:06:34,416
All I know is Terry told us to wait for him.

38
00:06:34,417 --> 00:06:36,717
Any of you guys see the cover to this doodad?

39
00:06:37,318 --> 00:06:39,518
You'd think that I might have been playing a fiddle.

40
00:06:39,519 --> 00:06:41,319
What are you squawking about, Happy?

41
00:06:41,320 --> 00:06:43,820
Suppose you had to carry a dog house
around all your life?

42
00:06:47,021 --> 00:06:48,321
Here we are, boys, here we go!

43
00:06:48,322 --> 00:06:50,322
Gather around, gentlemen, and why!

44
00:06:50,323 --> 00:06:52,123
Here we are.

45
00:06:53,324 --> 00:06:55,624
Champagne, champagne and more champagne.

46
00:06:55,625 --> 00:06:59,725
Let's get some chairs, and the trays
and some glasses down there.

47
00:06:59,726 --> 00:07:01,726
Come on, wrap yourselves around
some of this champagne.

48
00:07:01,727 --> 00:07:04,027
Champagne
Wow, what is all this?

49
00:07:04,028 --> 00:07:08,128
One last drink before I go, boys.
Ah, success, success, success.

50
00:07:08,129 --> 00:07:11,929
Let's get all our goodbyes done here.
Boy, this is goodbye in anybody's language.

51
00:07:11,930 --> 00:07:14,600
We'll call it auf wiedersehen.
Now, look.

52
00:07:14,601 --> 00:07:16,201
I don't want anybody to come to the train with me.

53
00:07:16,202 --> 00:07:19,402
Oh, now, wait a minute, Terry.
No, no, no. I get embarrassed.

54
00:07:19,403 --> 00:07:22,503
Standing around saying goodbye, goodbye, goodbye
for a half hour.

55
00:07:22,504 --> 00:07:24,104
Makes me self-conscious.

56
00:07:24,105 --> 00:07:25,905
Anyway, I'll be back in a couple of weeks.

57
00:07:25,906 --> 00:07:30,006
I don't know, if they get you out there in Hollywood
and make one of those movie heroes out of you.

58
00:07:30,007 --> 00:07:31,797
You mean I'm a cinch, can't miss?
I ain't kidding.

59
00:07:31,798 --> 00:07:33,508
You wouldn't toy with me?
Hm-hmm.

60
00:07:33,509 --> 00:07:35,109
Don't worry, I'll be back.

61
00:07:35,110 --> 00:07:37,210
And meanwhile you're all set.
I've seen to that.

62
00:07:37,211 --> 00:07:39,411
Anyway, I'm leaving Rita with you.

63
00:07:39,412 --> 00:07:40,812
Where is Rita?

64
00:07:40,813 --> 00:07:42,813
Rita! Rita!
I'll call her.

65
00:07:42,814 --> 00:07:44,414
Call her, will you?
Hey, Rita.

66
00:07:44,415 --> 00:07:46,515
Rita, Terry wants to see you.

67
00:07:49,016 --> 00:07:50,916
Come on, canary, get your nose wet.

68
00:07:51,317 --> 00:07:54,317
And, uh... You don't think I'm gonna leave
my baby for long, do you?

69
00:07:54,318 --> 00:07:55,618
Yeah, sweet, all for you.

70
00:07:55,619 --> 00:07:58,219
For now, auf wieder all.

71
00:07:58,220 --> 00:08:00,320
Good night all.
Here we go.

72
00:08:01,621 --> 00:08:03,321
Hal, I've got a job for you.
Yeah?

73
00:08:03,322 --> 00:08:05,822
Yeah, dig out the Wedding March in Lohengrin.
The Wedding March?

74
00:08:05,823 --> 00:08:07,923
Still a good tune.
We'll give it a shot in New York.

75
00:08:07,924 --> 00:08:10,204
You make a nice arrangement,
something sweet and hot.

76
00:08:10,205 --> 00:08:12,105
What do you wanna do with that old tomato?

77
00:08:12,106 --> 00:08:14,806
Come on, geek.
What do you need, a blueprint?

78
00:08:16,607 --> 00:08:20,307
Oh, I know what you mean.
You mean something like this.

79
00:10:23,108 --> 00:10:26,008
That must be Rooney.
Come on, kids.

80
00:10:28,409 --> 00:10:29,709
Terry Rooney?
Yeah.

81
00:10:29,710 --> 00:10:31,910
I'm Hank Meyers, Publicity Department,
Galor Studio.

82
00:10:31,911 --> 00:10:34,301
Glad to meet you.
How are you, Terry? Come on, kids, okay.

83
00:10:34,302 --> 00:10:36,602
This is Jan, Joan, Eleanor and Dora.

84
00:10:36,603 --> 00:10:37,603
How do you do?

85
00:10:37,604 --> 00:10:39,604
Out of your clothes, kids.
Come on, we got work to do here.

86
00:10:39,605 --> 00:10:41,605
Straight up, that's better.

87
00:10:41,606 --> 00:10:44,606
We shoot from right down there, Eddie.
There you go, girls. Light it up.

88
00:10:46,307 --> 00:10:47,807
Give me that smile now.

89
00:10:47,908 --> 00:10:49,908
Hold it!
That's good.

90
00:10:49,909 --> 00:10:51,109
Next.

91
00:10:52,610 --> 00:10:53,710
Hold that.

92
00:10:53,711 --> 00:10:55,411
That's good. Next.

93
00:10:56,312 --> 00:10:58,012
That's the one. Hold that now.

94
00:10:58,013 --> 00:10:59,113
Good!

95
00:10:59,114 --> 00:11:02,614
There we are, That's enough, kids.
Into the coats.

96
00:11:02,906 --> 00:11:05,406
I'm sorry.
All right. The cars are outside.

97
00:11:05,407 --> 00:11:08,707
Okay, Terry.
A car for you, too. Come on.

98
00:11:16,908 --> 00:11:18,108
Hi, Toots.

99
00:11:18,109 --> 00:11:19,609
How do you do?
Good morning, honey.

100
00:11:20,611 --> 00:11:22,111
The name's Rooney.

101
00:11:23,512 --> 00:11:26,602
Mr. Regan?
Oh, Mr. Regan...

102
00:11:30,503 --> 00:11:31,603
Yes?

103
00:11:31,604 --> 00:11:35,104
Mr. Regan, Mr. Hank
and Mr. Rooney are here.

104
00:11:36,005 --> 00:11:37,205
Yes, sir.

105
00:11:37,206 --> 00:11:39,706
Go right in.
Thank you very much.

106
00:11:39,707 --> 00:11:40,707
Thank you.

107
00:11:42,408 --> 00:11:44,808
How do you do, Mr. Regan, I'm happy to see you.

108
00:11:44,809 --> 00:11:48,409
No, that's not Regan. That's his secretary, Eddie Burns.
Well, hello, anyway.

109
00:11:48,410 --> 00:11:50,810
Hi, Mr. Burns. How are you?
Mr. Regan is expecting you.

110
00:11:50,811 --> 00:11:51,911
Thank you so much.
Thank you.

111
00:11:55,012 --> 00:11:58,312
Hi, B.O. Here's your new leading man
for any old for "Any Old Love".

112
00:11:58,313 --> 00:11:59,713
Name's Terry Rooney.

113
00:11:59,714 --> 00:12:03,114
Hi, Mr. Regan. I'm very happy to be here.

114
00:12:08,015 --> 00:12:11,315
Oh, so you're happy to be here, are you?

115
00:12:11,316 --> 00:12:15,116
You're happy to be here.
Of course you are.

116
00:12:15,317 --> 00:12:18,617
Hollywood is the natural goal
of any actor's ambition.

117
00:12:18,618 --> 00:12:21,218
You're wrong, B.O.,
he's not an actor.

118
00:12:21,219 --> 00:12:24,319
He's a hoofer.
Hollywood is the natural goal of any hoofer.

119
00:12:24,320 --> 00:12:27,820
And Bennett O. Regan will try
to make you an actor.

120
00:12:27,821 --> 00:12:30,021
Thanks, Mr. Regan, thanks very much.

121
00:12:30,022 --> 00:12:33,492
Come over here.
Yes, Mr. Regan... Oh, I'm sorry.

122
00:12:34,493 --> 00:12:36,293
Come over here at once.

123
00:12:38,094 --> 00:12:39,994
Come to my office immediately.

124
00:12:41,495 --> 00:12:44,595
In Hollywood, Mr. er...
Rooney, Rooney.

125
00:12:44,596 --> 00:12:47,496
Yes, thank you...
In Hollywood, Mr. Rooney, we create.

126
00:12:47,497 --> 00:12:51,297
We create not only pictures
but actors and actresses as well.

127
00:12:51,298 --> 00:12:54,608
We create and mold them.

128
00:12:54,609 --> 00:12:59,109
We even try to mold hoofers.
Soon you'll find that out, Rooney.

129
00:12:59,110 --> 00:13:02,990
Please, please don't turn away.
I'm speaking.

130
00:13:02,991 --> 00:13:03,901
I'm so sorry.

131
00:13:04,502 --> 00:13:07,602
The hair.
Do you always comb it that way?

132
00:13:08,103 --> 00:13:11,703
I er...
Yes, yes I do, but er...

133
00:13:12,604 --> 00:13:14,504
I can change it if it's important.

134
00:13:14,505 --> 00:13:16,805
Important? Imp...

135
00:13:19,806 --> 00:13:21,606
Important...

136
00:13:24,707 --> 00:13:26,997
Here they are. Grief, trouble and worry.

137
00:13:26,998 --> 00:13:28,998
Gentlemen.
Good evening, Mr. Regan.

138
00:13:28,999 --> 00:13:30,499
This is Mr. Terry Rooney,

139
00:13:30,500 --> 00:13:32,900
who's to play the male lead in "Any Old Love!

140
00:13:32,901 --> 00:13:34,999
Mr. Eastman, from the makeup department.

141
00:13:40,100 --> 00:13:42,600
The hairline!
Gracious!

142
00:13:42,601 --> 00:13:45,801
It belongs on an entirely different face, Mr. Regan.

143
00:13:45,802 --> 00:13:47,402
Well, fix it!

144
00:13:47,999 --> 00:13:49,999
So easily said.

145
00:13:50,000 --> 00:13:52,100
Mr. Daviani, our wardrobe expert.

146
00:13:55,401 --> 00:13:59,001
The clothes. Gentlemen don't wear clothes like that.

147
00:13:59,002 --> 00:14:01,602
Of course, of course.
That's why I brought you in here.

148
00:14:01,603 --> 00:14:04,303
Mr. Farney, our dialogue director.

149
00:14:10,304 --> 00:14:11,904
Speak to me.

150
00:14:12,405 --> 00:14:14,305
Why, it's er...

151
00:14:14,306 --> 00:14:16,306
It's rather hard to think of anything to say.

152
00:14:16,999 --> 00:14:19,607
Would you mind to repeat this once more?

153
00:14:19,608 --> 00:14:23,008
I said it was rather hard to think
of anything to say.

154
00:14:23,709 --> 00:14:26,009
Once more, please.

155
00:14:27,210 --> 00:14:31,610
I just said it was rather hard to think
of anything to say.

156
00:14:32,011 --> 00:14:33,311
Thank you.

157
00:14:33,312 --> 00:14:38,512
Impossible. The diction. Those "rs".
It will take months.

158
00:14:38,513 --> 00:14:40,913
And the voice is not in the mask.

159
00:14:40,914 --> 00:14:42,614
I place him in your hands.

160
00:14:42,615 --> 00:14:44,215
Gentlemen!
Yes, Mr. Regan.

161
00:14:44,216 --> 00:14:46,416
You have work to do.
I want to shoot him in two weeks.

162
00:14:46,417 --> 00:14:47,817
Yes, Mr. Regan.

163
00:14:53,518 --> 00:14:57,618
You see what I mean?
In breathing you must remember the diaphragm.

164
00:14:57,619 --> 00:14:59,999
Very important. Like this.

165
00:15:02,100 --> 00:15:04,300
Why, I thought I knew how to breathe.

166
00:15:04,301 --> 00:15:05,701
I've been doing it a long time, you know?

167
00:15:05,702 --> 00:15:08,702
Please. Now once more for the diction.

168
00:15:09,103 --> 00:15:10,303
See?

169
00:15:12,504 --> 00:15:16,004
The duke blew on the hunting horn

170
00:15:16,005 --> 00:15:20,105
and he laughed, ha-ha,
when the hounds came running.

171
00:15:20,506 --> 00:15:22,706
Like that?
Yes, exactly.

172
00:15:24,207 --> 00:15:25,407
Here we go.

173
00:15:29,608 --> 00:15:32,408
The duke blew on the hunting horn

174
00:15:32,409 --> 00:15:36,009
and laughed, ha-ha,
when the hounds came running.

175
00:15:36,010 --> 00:15:39,410
Please, don't do as I say.
Say as I do.

176
00:15:39,911 --> 00:15:43,211
A bit lower, lower.
Yes.

177
00:15:44,012 --> 00:15:46,512
The duke blew on his hunting horn
and laughed when the hounds came running.

178
00:15:47,213 --> 00:15:51,000
Please, not, "dook", "duke".
I said "duke".

179
00:15:51,001 --> 00:15:53,801
Not "laft", "laughed".
I said "laughed".

180
00:15:53,802 --> 00:15:54,902
"Laughed"!

181
00:15:55,503 --> 00:15:59,103
I want to hear those pear-shaped vowels.

182
00:15:59,104 --> 00:16:02,999
Pear-shaped.
Which end of the pear?

183
00:16:03,905 --> 00:16:08,105
The duke blew on his hunting horn
and laughed when the hounds came running.

184
00:16:08,106 --> 00:16:12,406
The duke blew on his hunting horn... Lower.
The duke blew his hunting horn... A little higher, please.

185
00:16:12,407 --> 00:16:15,507
The duke on blew the hunting horn
and laughed when the hounds came running.

186
00:16:15,508 --> 00:16:18,608
The duke blew on the hunting horn
and laughed ahhh!

187
00:16:18,609 --> 00:16:23,409
Mr. Rooney, please!
Now, look. I'm a quiet, peaceful kind of a fellow

188
00:16:23,410 --> 00:16:25,610
and I'm willing to stand here all day
and let you stick pins in me.

189
00:16:25,611 --> 00:16:27,211
But one more tickle

190
00:16:27,212 --> 00:16:29,312
and I'm gonna break off a leg
and wrap it around your neck for a scarf.

191
00:16:29,312 --> 00:16:32,112
I'm sorry, but the coat must be perfect.

192
00:16:32,113 --> 00:16:33,303
Hm-hmm.

193
00:16:36,504 --> 00:16:39,604
The duke blew on his hunting horn
and laughed when the...

194
00:16:40,205 --> 00:16:43,305
Would you mind pulling your coat
down just a trifle?

195
00:16:43,306 --> 00:16:44,706
You pull it down.

196
00:16:48,207 --> 00:16:49,407
Thank you.

197
00:16:50,208 --> 00:16:52,308
The duke blew on his hunting horn...

198
00:16:54,509 --> 00:16:57,309
and laughed when the hounds came running.

199
00:16:57,310 --> 00:16:59,999
Mr. Rooney, if you don't mind.

200
00:17:00,000 --> 00:17:02,000
You distract me.

201
00:17:02,601 --> 00:17:04,701
The duke blew on his hunting horn...

202
00:17:06,202 --> 00:17:08,002
Was that pear-shaped enough?

203
00:17:08,903 --> 00:17:12,503
You're just aggravating me.
Oh, who said?

204
00:17:12,504 --> 00:17:15,004
I'm just whipping up a batch
of pear-shaped vowels.

205
00:17:16,005 --> 00:17:19,505
When I look at that hairline I could almost cry.

206
00:17:20,206 --> 00:17:21,606
Wait a minute.

207
00:17:21,607 --> 00:17:23,307
Just a minute. I want you to see this.

208
00:17:23,308 --> 00:17:25,298
Now, it will help,
you can take my word for it.

209
00:17:25,299 --> 00:17:27,499
It'll help.
Now there.

210
00:17:27,500 --> 00:17:29,500
The Robert Taylor...
Now look.

211
00:17:29,501 --> 00:17:31,801
I've heard all I want to hear
about Robert Taylor.

212
00:17:33,002 --> 00:17:35,702
This pan of mine may not be anything
to boast about

213
00:17:35,703 --> 00:17:38,003
but I'm not going to wear a widow's peak.

214
00:17:38,004 --> 00:17:39,104
But I...

215
00:17:39,105 --> 00:17:42,205
I've worn this face of mine a long time.
I've washed it, I've shaved it...

216
00:17:42,206 --> 00:17:44,606
I've sung with it, and more than once
I've fallen on it.

217
00:17:44,607 --> 00:17:47,707
And if Regan doesn't like it, I'm gonna take it
right back where it came from.

218
00:17:47,708 --> 00:17:49,908
But I will not wear a widow's peak.

219
00:17:49,909 --> 00:17:50,909
Savvy?

220
00:17:52,710 --> 00:17:56,410
Oh, Academy Award, eh?
Yes, the Academy Award.

221
00:17:56,411 --> 00:17:59,011
Ah, how nice.
For which picture did you win it?

222
00:17:59,012 --> 00:18:01,382
Well, we haven't won it for a picture yet

223
00:18:01,383 --> 00:18:04,583
but I thought it'd be nice
to have it around to get used to it.

224
00:18:05,584 --> 00:18:08,304
One gets used to so much in Hollywood.

225
00:18:08,605 --> 00:18:09,905
Yes.

226
00:18:09,906 --> 00:18:11,406
Never mind.

227
00:18:11,407 --> 00:18:15,687
Steffie, did you see the rushes
of Terry Rooney today?

228
00:18:15,688 --> 00:18:20,388
Oh, yes, I saw the rushes of him.
He's all right, I suppose.

229
00:18:20,389 --> 00:18:21,789
But, um...
All right!

230
00:18:21,790 --> 00:18:24,790
But I am not interested in your baby stars.

231
00:18:24,791 --> 00:18:27,091
No?
No, no, no, no.

232
00:18:27,092 --> 00:18:30,192
For my leading man I must have an actor.

233
00:18:30,193 --> 00:18:34,693
Well, of course, Steffie, I know that you have
the privilege of choosing your leading men

234
00:18:34,694 --> 00:18:38,394
for your pictures, but in this case
I think you're making a mistake.

235
00:18:38,395 --> 00:18:41,695
But I am not running a school for acting.

236
00:18:41,696 --> 00:18:43,896
No, Steffie, you certainly are not.

237
00:18:43,897 --> 00:18:48,197
I demand a supporting cast at least
worthy of my talents.

238
00:18:48,198 --> 00:18:50,398
Well, Steffie, we'll think about it.

239
00:18:53,399 --> 00:18:55,709
Goodbye, dear.
Au revoir.

240
00:18:55,710 --> 00:18:57,310
Hm? Oh...

241
00:18:59,011 --> 00:19:01,011
The egotistical little mink coat!

242
00:19:01,012 --> 00:19:03,412
What does she think she's doing.
Who does she think she is?

243
00:19:03,413 --> 00:19:04,900
Take a letter.
Yes, sir.

244
00:19:04,901 --> 00:19:08,901
Miss Stephanie Hajos, Galor Studios.
Dear Madam.

245
00:19:09,802 --> 00:19:13,702
Where's Blaine?
On the set rehearsing Terry Rooney.

246
00:19:13,703 --> 00:19:14,903
I gotta see him.

247
00:19:15,904 --> 00:19:17,404
That sound ready?
Ready.

248
00:19:17,405 --> 00:19:18,405
All right.

249
00:19:20,006 --> 00:19:21,706
How about you, Terry?

250
00:19:21,707 --> 00:19:24,107
Have you got the lines or do you want
to run through them again?

251
00:19:24,108 --> 00:19:26,008
I think I know them now.
We can make a shot if you like.

252
00:19:26,009 --> 00:19:27,709
All right. Let's make a take.

253
00:19:27,710 --> 00:19:29,110
Come on, come on, boys.

254
00:19:31,411 --> 00:19:33,211
Hurry up.
Oh, that's all right...

255
00:19:35,512 --> 00:19:39,012
Remember, pear-shaped.
Pear-shaped.

256
00:19:39,013 --> 00:19:41,113
Come on, come on, let's go.

257
00:19:41,114 --> 00:19:42,714
Very important.
Okay.

258
00:19:42,714 --> 00:19:45,514
Oh, now, go away and let me alone.
Come on, let's go.

259
00:19:45,515 --> 00:19:48,515
Will you get this thing out of the way, please?

260
00:19:48,516 --> 00:19:51,416
Come on, now.
Quiet, please! Roll 'em.

261
00:19:52,417 --> 00:19:53,617
Speed!

262
00:19:54,018 --> 00:19:55,318
Action.

263
00:19:56,219 --> 00:19:59,709
Oh, Holly. Miss Emily was supposed to be here
at 8 o'clock, wasn't she?

264
00:19:59,710 --> 00:20:01,999
Blaine. Mr. Blaine...

265
00:20:02,000 --> 00:20:03,200
Cut!

266
00:20:03,601 --> 00:20:06,401
All right, relax, everybody.

267
00:20:11,402 --> 00:20:14,402
I saw the rushes this morning
and the boy is great.

268
00:20:14,403 --> 00:20:18,003
He's got it, Blaine.
He certainly surprised me.

269
00:20:18,504 --> 00:20:20,704
But I don't want him to know it.

270
00:20:20,705 --> 00:20:23,705
You've all spoiled Stephanie Hajos
by telling her how good she was.

271
00:20:23,706 --> 00:20:25,806
Now tell him he's no good.

272
00:20:25,807 --> 00:20:28,457
How can you expect me to get
a performance out of him

273
00:20:28,458 --> 00:20:30,458
if I continually tell him he's no good?

274
00:20:30,459 --> 00:20:33,459
Well, tell him it'll take him five years
to make an actor out of him.

275
00:20:33,460 --> 00:20:35,500
But don't let him see the rushes.

276
00:20:35,501 --> 00:20:38,501
And I'll fire anybody who tells him
he's any good.

277
00:20:39,302 --> 00:20:41,302
If I'm bad as they say in this picture as I am

278
00:20:42,103 --> 00:20:45,003
I'm gonna do the sensational nose dive of the century.

279
00:20:45,004 --> 00:20:49,104
It makes honorable master very happy
to joke with humble servant.

280
00:20:49,105 --> 00:20:50,605
It's no joke, Ito.

281
00:20:50,606 --> 00:20:52,206
At least the director doesn't think so.

282
00:20:52,207 --> 00:20:53,507
Yes, please.

283
00:20:53,908 --> 00:20:57,408
Honorable master would like
humble servant bring dinner?

284
00:20:57,409 --> 00:21:01,309
No, thanks.
I'm sick and tired of eating in this joint.

285
00:21:01,310 --> 00:21:02,510
Yes, please.

286
00:21:03,811 --> 00:21:05,311
You know, Ito....

287
00:21:05,712 --> 00:21:09,212
you're the only one around this studio
who'll even deign to talk to me.

288
00:21:09,213 --> 00:21:12,313
And all you can say is "Yes, please".

289
00:21:13,014 --> 00:21:16,014
Would you rather that I spoke ordinary English, sir?

290
00:21:17,815 --> 00:21:19,315
Was that you?
Yes, sir.

291
00:21:19,316 --> 00:21:23,616
My former employers felt that the accent
lent a certain dignity.

292
00:21:25,617 --> 00:21:27,017
Now look here.

293
00:21:28,118 --> 00:21:32,018
You're not gonna stand there in all this heat
and tell me this Japanese lingo is an act.

294
00:21:32,019 --> 00:21:34,419
Oh, very much so.

295
00:21:34,420 --> 00:21:35,999
Pull up a chair.

296
00:21:37,200 --> 00:21:38,400
Sit down.

297
00:21:40,401 --> 00:21:42,001
I want to hear about this.

298
00:21:42,002 --> 00:21:43,402
Tell me about yourself.

299
00:21:43,403 --> 00:21:45,903
I came here aspiring to be an actor.

300
00:21:45,904 --> 00:21:49,404
And they couldn't mold you, huh?
They didn't even try.

301
00:21:49,405 --> 00:21:50,795
Tell me,

302
00:21:50,796 --> 00:21:53,776
how do you like being a gentleman's gentleman?
Oh, very much.

303
00:21:53,896 --> 00:21:56,596
As an actor, it was a long time between meals.

304
00:21:58,197 --> 00:21:59,907
What are you doing for dinner?

305
00:21:59,908 --> 00:22:04,000
I know a place on Hollywood Boulevard
where they serve wonderful wiener schnitzel.

306
00:22:04,001 --> 00:22:05,901
Swell. May I come along?

307
00:22:06,202 --> 00:22:08,802
It's rather embarrassing, but...

308
00:22:08,803 --> 00:22:10,593
there was a young lady that I had to...

309
00:22:10,594 --> 00:22:12,904
Oh, I'm sorry. I shouldn't even have mentioned it.
Forgive me, will you?

310
00:22:12,905 --> 00:22:16,195
Well, uh... You're probably late for your date now.
You better go on.

311
00:22:16,196 --> 00:22:19,296
Oh, thank you, please.
Come on, Ito. Stop kidding me, will you?

312
00:22:19,297 --> 00:22:22,797
Thank you. Thank you, please.
Will you go on. Go home.

313
00:22:29,098 --> 00:22:31,498
The topper and the payoff.

314
00:22:36,799 --> 00:22:39,299
A Japanese who speaks English better than I do...

315
00:22:39,800 --> 00:22:42,000
with a weakness for wiener schnitzel.

316
00:22:44,001 --> 00:22:45,801
It's too much for me in my weakened condition.

317
00:22:47,202 --> 00:22:51,502
Hello? I want to put in a person-to-person call
to New York City.

318
00:22:51,703 --> 00:22:53,303
Yes, please.

319
00:23:06,904 --> 00:23:08,694
The phone's ringing! Hold it!

320
00:23:08,695 --> 00:23:10,895
Rita! Hollywood's calling!

321
00:23:12,096 --> 00:23:14,896
Hey, shut up, will you?
Let her talk on the phone.

322
00:23:14,897 --> 00:23:16,797
Oh, hello, darling.

323
00:23:16,798 --> 00:23:18,498
How are you, canary?

324
00:23:18,499 --> 00:23:21,499
Darling! How are you?

325
00:23:21,500 --> 00:23:24,400
Oh, lower than a whale's foot.

326
00:23:24,401 --> 00:23:26,401
Silly. A whale doesn't have feet.

327
00:23:28,002 --> 00:23:29,702
Did you ever see a whale's foot?

328
00:23:30,403 --> 00:23:32,103
You'd be amazed.

329
00:23:32,304 --> 00:23:33,404
Hm?

330
00:23:33,405 --> 00:23:36,305
Oh, it was funny when I first got in.
I thought I could handle it but...

331
00:23:36,999 --> 00:23:40,606
Kinda getting under my skin now.
Let's not talk about that...

332
00:23:40,607 --> 00:23:41,807
I wanna forget it.

333
00:23:41,808 --> 00:23:43,108
How are things with you?

334
00:23:43,109 --> 00:23:44,909
We've written a new song.

335
00:23:44,910 --> 00:23:46,310
You have?

336
00:23:46,811 --> 00:23:48,511
Come on, sweetheart, sing it to me.

337
00:23:50,012 --> 00:23:52,812
I don't care if it costs a million.
Go on. Shoot.

338
00:23:52,913 --> 00:23:54,513
Wait a minute.
Wait till I get comfortable.

339
00:23:59,714 --> 00:24:03,999
Okay, darling. Go on, render your song down.
Tear me apart. Go on.

340
00:24:04,000 --> 00:24:06,200
It's costing him money. Hurry.

341
00:24:08,101 --> 00:24:09,301
Ready?

342
00:24:28,902 --> 00:24:33,102
<i>Stop to ask the why or wherefore.</i>

343
00:24:34,003 --> 00:24:38,703
<i>Wouldn't help me any if I would.</i>

344
00:24:41,504 --> 00:24:47,404
<i>Only know that you're the one I care for.</i>

345
00:24:48,005 --> 00:24:54,905
<i>Trying to reason wouldn't do no good.</i>

346
00:25:01,106 --> 00:25:05,206
<i> Right or wrong.</i>

347
00:25:05,207 --> 00:25:08,307
<i>This I know.</i>

348
00:25:08,308 --> 00:25:15,208
<i>Love is just like a strong undertow</i>

349
00:25:16,109 --> 00:25:21,709
<i>that takes me wherever you go.</i>

350
00:25:21,710 --> 00:25:24,310
Marvelous, marvelous.

351
00:25:25,311 --> 00:25:28,311
<i>Right or wrong.</i>

352
00:25:28,312 --> 00:25:32,312
<i>Right or wrong.</i>

353
00:25:32,313 --> 00:25:36,113
<i>Your commands</i>

354
00:25:36,114 --> 00:25:42,914
<i>are all that my heart understands.</i>

355
00:25:42,915 --> 00:25:49,515
<i>I'm only a slave in your hands.</i>

356
00:25:52,316 --> 00:25:55,316
<i>Right or wrong</i>

357
00:25:55,317 --> 00:25:59,317
<i>When you're near</i>

358
00:25:59,318 --> 00:26:02,718
<i>All my fears,</i>

359
00:26:02,719 --> 00:26:09,219
<i>every doubt that I have disappears.</i>

360
00:26:09,520 --> 00:26:12,700
<i>But sweetheart</i>

361
00:26:12,701 --> 00:26:16,301
<i>when we part</i>

362
00:26:16,302 --> 00:26:22,802
<i>the thoughts of my longing you start</i>

363
00:26:22,803 --> 00:26:26,703
<i>Right or wrong.</i>

364
00:26:26,704 --> 00:26:30,204
<i>Who can tell?</i>

365
00:26:30,205 --> 00:26:36,405
<i>When each beat of my heart knows so well.</i>

366
00:26:36,406 --> 00:26:43,106
<i>For life may be heaven or hell</i>

367
00:26:43,107 --> 00:26:46,507
<i>I'll string along</i>

368
00:26:46,508 --> 00:26:54,108
<i>Right or wrong.</i>

369
00:26:55,209 --> 00:26:58,809
Hang up, will you?
Listen, you're breaking my heart.

370
00:26:59,210 --> 00:27:01,410
Any more of this and I'll cut my throat.

371
00:27:02,111 --> 00:27:04,111
I'm that homesick now.

372
00:27:04,612 --> 00:27:05,912
Will you please hang up?

373
00:27:05,913 --> 00:27:07,413
No, don't make me hang up.
You do it.

374
00:27:11,614 --> 00:27:13,214
All right. Boys!

375
00:27:13,215 --> 00:27:15,715
Boys on this camera,
listen to me just a minute.

376
00:27:15,716 --> 00:27:17,816
I want you to take this boom up
as far as it'll go

377
00:27:17,817 --> 00:27:20,117
and give me a shot of the complete set.
Got that?

378
00:27:20,118 --> 00:27:22,018
All right, take your boom up
whenever you're ready.

379
00:27:22,919 --> 00:27:25,619
Hold the lights. Are we all set?
All set, Mr. Blaine.

380
00:27:28,820 --> 00:27:31,520
Now listen, boys.
Everybody, please.

381
00:27:31,721 --> 00:27:33,621
Hey, Rooney, don't play with the props,
will you?

382
00:27:33,622 --> 00:27:36,322
Andy, Andy!
Yes, Mr. Blaine.

383
00:27:36,323 --> 00:27:40,303
Let's get to work. This is the last shot
in the picture and let's get it right.

384
00:27:40,504 --> 00:27:43,804
I don't want much of a fight here,
but I do want it to be good.

385
00:27:43,805 --> 00:27:45,305
You understand?

386
00:27:45,306 --> 00:27:47,106
All right. Everybody on your toes now.

387
00:27:47,107 --> 00:27:48,407
By the way, Terry, come here.

388
00:27:52,008 --> 00:27:54,598
You've never staged a fight before, have you?
No, never have.

389
00:27:54,599 --> 00:27:56,399
No fight, eh?
No.

390
00:27:56,400 --> 00:27:59,900
Well, don't let it worry you.
It's perfectly simple.

391
00:27:59,901 --> 00:28:01,999
Hm-hmm.
It's all a matter of camera angles.

392
00:28:02,000 --> 00:28:06,200
You see, we'll get in an angle so that
when he makes a pass at you

393
00:28:06,501 --> 00:28:07,501
it'll be like this...

394
00:28:07,502 --> 00:28:11,000
Take it, let your head go back with it.

395
00:28:11,001 --> 00:28:12,401
Do it again, huh?
All right.

396
00:28:12,402 --> 00:28:14,302
Ready? Here we go.

397
00:28:14,903 --> 00:28:16,800
That's it!
Simple as that, huh?

398
00:28:16,801 --> 00:28:18,401
Simple as that.
Well, uh...

399
00:28:18,402 --> 00:28:21,302
Tell me, do those other boys
know how to do it just as well as you do?

400
00:28:21,303 --> 00:28:24,003
Oh, yes, don't worry about that.
They've been doing it for years.

401
00:28:25,304 --> 00:28:28,104
By the way, you're not afraid,
are you, Terry?

402
00:28:28,105 --> 00:28:29,205
Oh, no, no.

403
00:28:29,206 --> 00:28:32,400
I don't care how hard they sock him.
I didn't make a thing he has on.

404
00:28:32,401 --> 00:28:35,101
I hope somebody at last will knock
a pear-shaped vowel out of him.

405
00:28:35,102 --> 00:28:36,102
I hope so.

406
00:28:36,103 --> 00:28:38,502
I haven't socked a green horn actor
in months.

407
00:28:38,503 --> 00:28:39,703
Get a load of this.

408
00:28:41,704 --> 00:28:43,304
I heard you remark, son.

409
00:28:43,305 --> 00:28:44,855
You're not afraid of us, are you?

410
00:28:46,456 --> 00:28:48,056
Hey, would you do that again?
Sure.

411
00:28:49,057 --> 00:28:50,757
It's all right.
You try one.

412
00:28:51,158 --> 00:28:52,358
You want me to try it?
Yeah.

413
00:28:52,759 --> 00:28:54,459
Close?
That's right.

414
00:28:57,360 --> 00:28:58,700
Yeah, you'll do it.
Good enough?

415
00:28:58,701 --> 00:29:00,300
You're okay.
Thanks.

416
00:29:00,801 --> 00:29:02,101
Thanks very much.

417
00:29:05,002 --> 00:29:08,102
Oh, too bad, too bad, too bad.

418
00:29:08,103 --> 00:29:10,903
All right, come on, everybody. On your toes.
Let's quite down now.

419
00:29:10,904 --> 00:29:12,704
Make this scene right.

420
00:29:12,705 --> 00:29:15,905
Come on, boys, I want to explain this scene
once more to you before we start to shoot.

421
00:29:15,906 --> 00:29:20,106
Now, Terry, on camera
you're coming down the stairway, you understand?

422
00:29:20,108 --> 00:29:22,908
Joe and Eddy are hiding back there.

423
00:29:22,909 --> 00:29:26,809
Oh, no like this.

424
00:29:28,410 --> 00:29:31,010
I just itch to take a poke at that chin.

425
00:29:31,011 --> 00:29:33,411
You should land, well, I should say about here.

426
00:29:33,412 --> 00:29:34,912
Right about there?
Right about here.

427
00:29:34,913 --> 00:29:38,013
Fine.
Okay? Fine, let's make a take.

428
00:29:38,014 --> 00:29:40,294
Cameras ready?
Sound ready?

429
00:29:40,295 --> 00:29:41,595
All right. Quiet, please.

430
00:29:41,596 --> 00:29:42,896
Johnny, got your number?

431
00:29:45,397 --> 00:29:47,797
I land right about there.
That's it.

432
00:29:47,798 --> 00:29:49,498
That's fine, thanks.

433
00:29:50,999 --> 00:29:52,399
Take your places now.

434
00:29:52,800 --> 00:29:54,100
On camera.

435
00:29:55,001 --> 00:29:56,101
Turn them over.

436
00:29:56,102 --> 00:29:57,302
Speed!

437
00:29:59,803 --> 00:30:01,203
Camera.

438
00:30:21,204 --> 00:30:22,204
Cut!

439
00:30:22,205 --> 00:30:23,705
Fine! Great!

440
00:30:23,706 --> 00:30:25,306
Cut my foot.

441
00:30:32,207 --> 00:30:34,407
Keep that traveler running.
Close that up.

442
00:30:34,408 --> 00:30:37,008
Keep it going.
Up on high there. Get all this.

443
00:30:43,509 --> 00:30:45,409
OK! Kill 'em!

444
00:30:51,010 --> 00:30:52,610
Sock 'em!

445
00:30:54,511 --> 00:30:56,311
Good for honorable master.

446
00:30:56,312 --> 00:30:58,012
Good for honorable master.

447
00:31:14,213 --> 00:31:15,513
Get this in your camera!

448
00:31:34,214 --> 00:31:35,914
Hey, what's going on here?

449
00:31:37,615 --> 00:31:39,015
I'll see you later.

450
00:31:42,616 --> 00:31:44,716
One, two...

451
00:31:45,817 --> 00:31:48,617
three, four...

452
00:31:49,218 --> 00:31:51,918
five, six.

453
00:31:51,919 --> 00:31:53,319
That does it.

454
00:31:53,320 --> 00:31:54,420
Yeah, please.

455
00:31:57,721 --> 00:31:59,421
Hello?
Hello, darling.

456
00:31:59,422 --> 00:32:00,922
Well, I'm through.

457
00:32:00,923 --> 00:32:03,923
Terry! Are you all right?

458
00:32:03,924 --> 00:32:07,124
Now look, sweets, pop yourself
on the first plane from San Francisco.

459
00:32:07,125 --> 00:32:08,525
I'll meet you at the airport.

460
00:32:08,526 --> 00:32:10,126
Oh, I'd love it.

461
00:32:10,827 --> 00:32:12,527
Where are we going?

462
00:32:12,528 --> 00:32:14,028
I don't know where we're going

463
00:32:14,029 --> 00:32:16,669
but it'll be far away
from where they make motion pictures.

464
00:32:16,670 --> 00:32:18,690
All right.
I love you, darling.

465
00:32:18,691 --> 00:32:21,000
I'll be waiting.
Bye-bye, darling.

466
00:32:21,001 --> 00:32:22,001
Bye.

467
00:32:24,202 --> 00:32:26,902
<i>I've something to sing about now</i>

468
00:32:26,903 --> 00:32:30,503
<i>And someday I'm gonna try singing a lullaby</i>

469
00:32:30,504 --> 00:32:33,104
<i>Who said that heaven's up above?</i>

470
00:32:33,105 --> 00:32:36,505
<i> I'm in love!</i>

471
00:32:42,406 --> 00:32:44,706
I didn't know anyone can be as happy as I am.

472
00:32:44,707 --> 00:32:46,407
Where are we going now?

473
00:32:46,408 --> 00:32:47,908
To the City Hall for a license.

474
00:32:47,909 --> 00:32:51,109
Oh, sweet, I've got a  confession to make.

475
00:32:51,110 --> 00:32:53,410
Well, if it's about another girl,
I don't want to hear...

476
00:32:53,411 --> 00:32:54,911
No, no, it isn't that.

477
00:32:54,912 --> 00:32:57,212
I've got to tell you that my name
is not Terry Rooney.

478
00:32:57,213 --> 00:32:59,713
I'll break the real one to you very, very gently.

479
00:32:59,714 --> 00:33:02,814
It's uh... It's McGillicuddy.
What?

480
00:33:02,815 --> 00:33:04,415
McGillicuddy.

481
00:33:04,416 --> 00:33:05,916
McGillicuddy?
Hm-hmm.

482
00:33:05,917 --> 00:33:09,517
But that isn't the worst.
The first name is Thaddeus.

483
00:33:10,718 --> 00:33:12,918
Mrs. Thaddeus McGillicuddy.

484
00:33:12,919 --> 00:33:13,719
Can you stand it?

485
00:33:15,520 --> 00:33:18,320
I've always wanted to be Mrs. Thaddeus McGillicuddy.

486
00:33:19,621 --> 00:33:23,221
And where are the McGillicuddies going
on their honeymoon?

487
00:33:23,222 --> 00:33:25,702
South Seas, we sail this afternoon.
And what's more?

488
00:33:25,703 --> 00:33:29,203
We're going on a very exclusive,
a very exclusive...

489
00:33:29,204 --> 00:33:30,504
tramp steamer.

490
00:33:30,505 --> 00:33:33,305
Tramp steamer?
We're the only passengers.

491
00:33:33,306 --> 00:33:36,106
That's wonderful.

492
00:33:40,507 --> 00:33:41,607
There it is. How do you like it?

493
00:33:41,608 --> 00:33:43,608
It's the most beautiful boat I ever saw.

494
00:33:43,609 --> 00:33:45,909
How are you, lad?
Mrs. McGillicuddy.

495
00:33:45,910 --> 00:33:46,910
How do you do?

496
00:33:46,911 --> 00:33:48,211
Come this way.

497
00:34:04,212 --> 00:34:08,412
Now listen Blaine, I want that Terry Rooney picture
ready for preview and I want it immediately

498
00:34:08,413 --> 00:34:12,313
But Mr. Regan, we're doing all we can.
We're working 24 hours a day.

499
00:34:12,314 --> 00:34:16,314
Well, work 25 hours a day if necessary.
Now when do I get the picture?

500
00:34:16,315 --> 00:34:18,605
In about three weeks.

501
00:34:18,606 --> 00:34:19,999
Well make it two.

502
00:34:27,200 --> 00:34:29,900
Cutting room.
When will the Rooney picture be ready for preview?

503
00:34:29,901 --> 00:34:31,901
It'll take us at least two weeks, Mr. Regan.

504
00:34:32,602 --> 00:34:33,802
One?

505
00:34:41,303 --> 00:34:44,003
Hey, Harry, where's that close-up
with Rooney in the fight sequence?

506
00:34:44,004 --> 00:34:45,804
Look in the tin can.

507
00:35:25,705 --> 00:35:29,405
<i>Any old love,
any hugs today...</i>

508
00:35:29,406 --> 00:35:33,306
<i>Any old kisses
that you want your way, say</i>

509
00:35:33,307 --> 00:35:35,707
<i>I'm just the fellow to see.</i>

510
00:35:36,508 --> 00:35:40,788
<i>A bona fide collector of anything to do with love</i>

511
00:35:40,789 --> 00:35:43,489
<i>and if you should find
a moon up in the sky</i>

512
00:35:43,490 --> 00:35:45,790
<i>and love on your mind</i>

513
00:35:45,791 --> 00:35:47,791
<i>babies, don't you cry.</i>

514
00:35:47,792 --> 00:35:50,202
<i>Just say this till I come your way.</i>

515
00:35:50,203 --> 00:35:53,403
<i>Hm?
Any old love today?</i>

516
00:35:57,804 --> 00:36:00,104
<i>Oh, mister...</i>

517
00:36:00,605 --> 00:36:03,605
<i>how about tonight?</i>

518
00:36:21,306 --> 00:36:25,606
Good, marvelous... I predicted that boy
would be a star the minute I saw him.

519
00:36:25,607 --> 00:36:28,207
Do you still want me to go on telling him
he's no good?

520
00:36:28,208 --> 00:36:31,608
By the way, Rooney ought to be here
right now to sign his contract.

521
00:36:32,309 --> 00:36:33,709
Is Terry Rooney up there?

522
00:36:33,710 --> 00:36:36,600
He's not here, Mr. Regan.
Well, find him.

523
00:36:36,601 --> 00:36:37,601
I'm waiting for him.

524
00:36:38,502 --> 00:36:41,502
Good, good...
I'm getting tired of saying "good".

525
00:36:41,503 --> 00:36:44,203
Oh, Hank, a terrible thing has happened.
We can't find him.

526
00:36:44,204 --> 00:36:46,304
Terry Rooney.
He's disappeared.

527
00:36:46,305 --> 00:36:48,105
He's gone.
We can't find him.

528
00:36:48,106 --> 00:36:50,006
He's vanished.
Oh, I see.

529
00:36:51,407 --> 00:36:53,207
And you're all afraid to tell Regan.

530
00:36:53,208 --> 00:36:54,808
Now don't quarrel, boys.

531
00:36:54,809 --> 00:36:56,009
Let me tell him.

532
00:36:56,010 --> 00:37:00,110
Disappeared?
I hope the poor boy didn't commit suicide.

533
00:37:00,111 --> 00:37:01,311
That's ridiculous!

534
00:37:01,312 --> 00:37:04,112
Yeah? He got some pretty rough treatment
around here.

535
00:37:04,113 --> 00:37:07,113
I make a star out of him
and you call it rough treatment.

536
00:37:07,114 --> 00:37:09,114
Get on the telephone. Call his orchestra.
Call New York.

537
00:37:09,115 --> 00:37:10,705
Hank, we've got to find that boy.

538
00:37:10,706 --> 00:37:13,406
First, I'll have the harbor dragged.
Hank...

539
00:37:13,407 --> 00:37:17,097
Hank, please, stop!
Hank, dear old boy, dear old pal...

540
00:37:17,098 --> 00:37:19,798
I'm depending on you now
more than I've ever depended on you before.

541
00:37:19,799 --> 00:37:22,699
Hire detectives. Do anything.
But find Rooney and bring him here...

542
00:37:22,700 --> 00:37:25,800
before he knows he's a success.
Now hurry, hurry!

543
00:37:25,801 --> 00:37:27,701
Maybe we best start with the morgue.

544
00:37:32,602 --> 00:37:35,702
Good, good, excellent.

545
00:37:35,703 --> 00:37:39,203
Good, good...
Hello! Hello!

546
00:37:49,904 --> 00:37:51,204
Any news?

547
00:37:51,805 --> 00:37:52,805
Oh.

548
00:37:54,106 --> 00:37:55,606
Not a thing.

549
00:37:55,607 --> 00:38:00,707
Hours of working, waiting, wondering.
And for what?

550
00:38:00,808 --> 00:38:01,908
Nothing.

551
00:38:01,909 --> 00:38:05,209
We're no nearer to finding Terry Rooney now
than we were when we started.

552
00:38:05,210 --> 00:38:08,310
Why do I have to be crucified like this?

553
00:38:09,811 --> 00:38:11,911
Any news?
Plenty of news.

554
00:38:11,912 --> 00:38:13,612
But it's all bad.

555
00:38:13,613 --> 00:38:17,713
Nothing but mystery.
But I can't get the idea of suicide out of my mind.

556
00:38:17,714 --> 00:38:20,704
Torture me with that word once more
and you're through with Galor Pictures.

557
00:38:20,705 --> 00:38:22,805
Oh, I'm just as anxious to find him as you are.

558
00:38:22,806 --> 00:38:25,306
He borrowed 5 bucks from me the other day
in the lunch room.

559
00:38:26,007 --> 00:38:27,707
Five bucks.
Yeah.

560
00:38:27,708 --> 00:38:30,608
Five dollars and I'm talking in millions.

561
00:38:30,609 --> 00:38:32,700
Five dollars means a lot to me on my salary.

562
00:38:32,701 --> 00:38:36,201
Hank, find him and I'll double your salary.
Agreed. He's found.

563
00:38:36,202 --> 00:38:38,202
I mean, I'll find him.
Just a minute.

564
00:38:38,203 --> 00:38:40,803
Is this some foul scheme of yours?

565
00:38:40,804 --> 00:38:43,804
Are you holding out on me?
Oh, B.O. ...

566
00:38:43,805 --> 00:38:45,405
I wouldn't do that.

567
00:38:50,306 --> 00:38:53,206
Terry Rooney, where are you?

568
00:38:53,907 --> 00:38:55,507
My Terry!

569
00:39:01,708 --> 00:39:03,308
...change of bites, he bites left...

570
00:39:03,309 --> 00:39:04,409
brown boy against the ropes...

571
00:39:04,410 --> 00:39:06,110
right white boy...

572
00:39:10,111 --> 00:39:12,711
Come on, white boy, that's it.

573
00:39:12,712 --> 00:39:15,612
Oh, right...
Right, left, right and left...

574
00:39:18,613 --> 00:39:20,413
Brown boy's down!

575
00:39:22,414 --> 00:39:26,014
Eight, nine, ten, he's out!

576
00:39:26,715 --> 00:39:29,115
Ladies and gentlemen,
you've missed the most terrific fight in years.

577
00:39:29,116 --> 00:39:30,916
Pandemonium, we're facing an uproar!

578
00:41:52,717 --> 00:41:54,317
Man overboard!

579
00:42:01,318 --> 00:42:03,118
Goodbye, McGillicuddy.

580
00:42:03,119 --> 00:42:05,419
When you get to Chicago look us up, will you?

581
00:42:05,420 --> 00:42:08,620
You bet!
Take good care of our little sweetheart.

582
00:42:08,621 --> 00:42:09,621
I will.

583
00:42:11,522 --> 00:42:13,322
See you in the next trip, Mac.

584
00:42:17,523 --> 00:42:20,623
Isn't this a terribly expensive suite?
Yep.

585
00:42:20,624 --> 00:42:22,724
Can we afford it?
No.

586
00:42:24,025 --> 00:42:26,125
Do you care?
No.

587
00:42:27,426 --> 00:42:29,026
Wait a minute, leave that on.

588
00:42:29,027 --> 00:42:31,827
We're going out take a nice long walk
so we can get our land legs.

589
00:42:31,828 --> 00:42:34,999
Good?
Oh, you have such lovely ideas, Thaddeus.

590
00:42:35,000 --> 00:42:36,800
Oh, Mrs. McGillicuddy. I strive to please.

591
00:42:36,801 --> 00:42:39,601
In fact, I strive to please Mrs. McGillicuddy.

592
00:42:42,402 --> 00:42:43,502
How do you feel now?

593
00:42:43,503 --> 00:42:44,903
Oh, I feel much better.

594
00:42:44,904 --> 00:42:46,444
Got your land legs yet?
Yes.

595
00:42:46,445 --> 00:42:47,405
That's Terry Rooney.

596
00:42:47,406 --> 00:42:49,106
Both of them?
Yes.

597
00:42:50,007 --> 00:42:51,807
Hey, is there something strange about me?

598
00:42:51,808 --> 00:42:53,708
People seem to be staring at me.
What is it?

599
00:42:53,709 --> 00:42:55,909
Oh, it's because you're so beautiful, darling.

600
00:42:55,910 --> 00:42:57,310
You think that's it?
Yes.

601
00:42:57,311 --> 00:42:59,311
Well, it has been said.

602
00:42:59,312 --> 00:43:00,912
Look what we have here.

603
00:43:00,913 --> 00:43:02,913
One of those movie palaces.

604
00:43:02,914 --> 00:43:07,214
Do you know that in places like these people
actually earn a living making faces?

605
00:43:07,215 --> 00:43:09,315
Really?
Absolutely. I know a man who did it.

606
00:43:09,316 --> 00:43:11,116
For example, they do things like this, uh...

607
00:43:11,117 --> 00:43:12,417
the double take,

608
00:43:13,318 --> 00:43:17,118
And then there would be the triple take
which was, uh...

609
00:43:17,119 --> 00:43:19,519
And the triple take with a slow burn...

610
00:43:19,520 --> 00:43:21,420
with a one-eye fade away, which was this.

611
00:43:28,021 --> 00:43:29,421
And uh..
Do another one.

612
00:43:29,422 --> 00:43:32,022
Another one? Well, there was the Charlie Murray,
who always did this.

613
00:43:43,223 --> 00:43:45,723
Now you see what a motion picture
career can do for you?

614
00:43:45,724 --> 00:43:47,124
That woman thinks I'm crazy.

615
00:43:47,125 --> 00:43:50,225
Come on, make some more faces.
Not on your life. I'm through for the evening.

616
00:43:53,726 --> 00:43:55,726
Is it my imagination or...

617
00:43:57,027 --> 00:43:58,327
or am I hearing my voice?

618
00:43:58,328 --> 00:44:00,778
There's nothing strange at that.
You're talking.

619
00:44:00,779 --> 00:44:02,279
That isn't what I mean.

620
00:44:03,180 --> 00:44:04,780
I'm singing someplace.

621
00:44:04,781 --> 00:44:06,981
Now, Terry.
No...

622
00:44:08,382 --> 00:44:09,882
It's "Any Old Love" from the picture.

623
00:44:09,883 --> 00:44:12,483
Ahhh, Mr. Terry Rooney.

624
00:44:12,884 --> 00:44:14,684
Please, take this flower

625
00:44:14,685 --> 00:44:17,785
Thank you so much.
Thank you.

626
00:44:19,786 --> 00:44:21,186
It's coming from over there.

627
00:44:27,387 --> 00:44:31,187
Why, look. They have pictures of you
plastered all over the place.

628
00:44:31,188 --> 00:44:34,388
Yes, darling. Things have been happening
while we've been away.

629
00:44:34,889 --> 00:44:37,389
But you didn't tell me they made
any records of you.

630
00:44:37,390 --> 00:44:39,490
They didn't. They probably took them
from the soundtrack.

631
00:44:43,791 --> 00:44:46,491
Hello, Mr. Rooney.
Your performance was lovely.

632
00:44:46,492 --> 00:44:49,492
Thank you.
Very fine performance, Mr. Rooney.

633
00:44:49,493 --> 00:44:51,093
Thank you.
Very glad you're back again.

634
00:44:52,694 --> 00:44:55,394
Please, Mr. Rooney, may I have your autograph?
Yes.

635
00:44:56,795 --> 00:44:59,195
May I have your autograph, Mr. Rooney, please?

636
00:45:28,696 --> 00:45:30,596
Rita! Rita, where are you?

637
00:45:32,497 --> 00:45:35,297
What's going on out there?
A fire, a riot or what?

638
00:45:35,298 --> 00:45:37,098
Terry Rooney's out there.
Terry Rooney?

639
00:45:37,099 --> 00:45:38,899
Yeah. Come on,
let's get him and bring him in.

640
00:45:40,000 --> 00:45:41,800
Mr. Rooney said that he'd meet you at the hotel.

641
00:45:41,801 --> 00:45:43,601
Thank you.
Guess you know what that means.

642
00:46:00,402 --> 00:46:03,102
Terry Rooney!
Get them out of the lobby.

643
00:46:03,103 --> 00:46:05,403
Get me the Galor Studios in Hollywood right away.

644
00:46:05,404 --> 00:46:07,704
Say, what is this all about?
It's about you.

645
00:46:07,705 --> 00:46:11,205
Can you tell me where on earth you've been?
Yes, certainly, the South Seas. Why?

646
00:46:11,206 --> 00:46:13,806
Why, he asks me why.
Give me that phone quick.

647
00:46:16,507 --> 00:46:17,907
Hello?

648
00:46:17,908 --> 00:46:20,708
Hello, this is the manager of the Belvedere Theater
in San Francisco.

649
00:46:20,709 --> 00:46:22,999
I've got Terry Rooney here in my office.

650
00:46:23,900 --> 00:46:26,700
What... who...Hold the phone!

651
00:46:28,501 --> 00:46:30,999
Rooney! Found him.

652
00:46:31,000 --> 00:46:33,390
San Francisco.
Telephone.

653
00:46:33,391 --> 00:46:34,701
What?
Yes.

654
00:46:38,592 --> 00:46:40,602
Mr. Regan! Mr. Regan!

655
00:46:40,603 --> 00:46:43,003
They found Terry Rooney. San Francisco.

656
00:46:43,004 --> 00:46:44,204
Telephone.

657
00:46:44,205 --> 00:46:46,905
Hello! Hello!
Give me that call for Mr. Regan.

658
00:46:46,906 --> 00:46:50,606
Call the airport and have the fastest plane
standing by for San Francisco.

659
00:46:50,607 --> 00:46:53,307
Give me the phone, boss.

660
00:46:53,308 --> 00:46:54,608
Nr Regan wants to talk to you.

661
00:46:54,609 --> 00:46:56,709
Regan?
Yeah.

662
00:46:56,710 --> 00:46:58,110
Hello, B.O.

663
00:46:58,111 --> 00:47:00,311
Huh? What are you saying...

664
00:47:00,912 --> 00:47:02,612
Oh, hello, Hank.

665
00:47:02,613 --> 00:47:05,303
Where are you staying?
Have you talked to any reporters?

666
00:47:05,304 --> 00:47:07,504
No, I haven't talked to anybody.
Nobody.

667
00:47:07,505 --> 00:47:10,105
Well, nobody but a crazy manager,
if that means anything.

668
00:47:10,106 --> 00:47:12,706
Swell, don't talk to him. Don't talk to anyone.

669
00:47:12,707 --> 00:47:15,107
Don't even talk to yourself.
All right, but...

670
00:47:15,108 --> 00:47:17,008
you ought to see what they did to my hat.

671
00:47:17,009 --> 00:47:19,999
B.O. and I are leaving right away by plane.
Yeah, right away.

672
00:47:20,000 --> 00:47:21,900
Just as soon as we can get to the airport.

673
00:47:21,901 --> 00:47:24,101
Now for the love of Mike
don't talk to anybody, will you?

674
00:47:24,102 --> 00:47:27,002
Hide in the closet till we get there.
Here we come. Goodbye, kid.

675
00:47:27,003 --> 00:47:29,003
Come on, B.O., let's get out of here.

676
00:47:29,504 --> 00:47:30,999
The contract!

677
00:47:31,999 --> 00:47:33,800
Thanks a lot!
Thanks for what?

678
00:47:33,801 --> 00:47:37,001
For all the publicity I'll get out of this.
Gosh, Mr. Rooney, you don't realize...

679
00:47:37,702 --> 00:47:39,502
I guess they must have liked the picture, huh?

680
00:47:39,503 --> 00:47:41,503
Liked it? Liked it?

681
00:47:48,604 --> 00:47:50,304
Hey, canary!
Yes?

682
00:47:51,405 --> 00:47:54,205
Can you see it from there?
Yes, I can see it from here.

683
00:47:54,206 --> 00:47:56,006
You can see from both of these.

684
00:47:58,207 --> 00:48:01,807
Oh, darling. I'm so proud of you
I don't know what to do.

685
00:48:04,008 --> 00:48:06,398
To think I married a celebrity
and didn't even know it.

686
00:48:06,399 --> 00:48:09,299
Oh, 'twas nothing at all.

687
00:48:10,100 --> 00:48:12,500
Anybody in my place would have done the same.

688
00:48:12,501 --> 00:48:16,801
You're not having a slight attack of swell head, are you?

689
00:48:16,802 --> 00:48:18,602
Yes, darling, I'm afraid so.

690
00:48:19,303 --> 00:48:21,603
I've got that good old feeling coming over me now.

691
00:48:23,004 --> 00:48:26,404
You now owe me 129 million dollars.

692
00:48:26,405 --> 00:48:28,305
Hm-hmm. Give me a bag-o-tail.

693
00:48:28,306 --> 00:48:30,706
I'll settle for a box of candies.

694
00:48:30,707 --> 00:48:32,507
You'll take chewing gum and like it.

695
00:48:36,308 --> 00:48:38,108
Probably Hank and the National Guard.

696
00:48:38,109 --> 00:48:41,209
I have to fix my hair. It's a mess.
You go get yourself fixed up...

697
00:48:41,210 --> 00:48:43,010
I won't say anything about you.
You stage a surprise entrance.

698
00:48:43,011 --> 00:48:46,611
Fix the door so I can hear a bit.
All right. Don't miss a word.

699
00:48:49,012 --> 00:48:51,012
Who's there?
Mr. Regan to see you.

700
00:48:51,013 --> 00:48:53,413
Regan?
Step right this way, sir.

701
00:48:53,414 --> 00:48:56,300
Terry, my boy!
Hey, kid.

702
00:48:56,301 --> 00:48:58,101
Hi, Terry.
Hank, I'm glad to see you.

703
00:48:58,102 --> 00:49:00,802
Baby, when I say I'm glad to see
I'm just beginning to talk.

704
00:49:00,803 --> 00:49:03,603
Say, Hank, I want you to forgive me for putting
the slug on you the last time I saw you, but you know...

705
00:49:03,604 --> 00:49:05,404
Forget that. I had it coming to me.
Where have you been?

706
00:49:05,405 --> 00:49:07,005
I've been running myself bald looking for you.

707
00:49:07,006 --> 00:49:09,706
Terry, here's the contract all ready for you to sign.

708
00:49:09,707 --> 00:49:11,707
Now look, B.O., let's get our hellos over with

709
00:49:11,708 --> 00:49:14,308
have a little drink or something
and then we talk about the contract later, huh?

710
00:49:14,309 --> 00:49:17,109
While you're talking you just take a look
at that money.

711
00:49:17,110 --> 00:49:19,210
Better take a peek, Terry.

712
00:49:23,011 --> 00:49:24,711
Did you read this?
Every word of it.

713
00:49:24,712 --> 00:49:26,212
See those figures?

714
00:49:26,213 --> 00:49:28,513
And you're worth every penny.
Do you know what that picture's doing across the street?

715
00:49:28,514 --> 00:49:30,404
It's doing very well.
Very well? It's terrific!

716
00:49:30,405 --> 00:49:32,505
Wait a minute, wait a minute...

717
00:49:34,306 --> 00:49:36,206
I can't sign this.
What's wrong?

718
00:49:37,207 --> 00:49:39,107
I just can't sign it.
Why?

719
00:49:39,108 --> 00:49:42,808
Pardon me, I...
Oh, this is Mrs. McGillicuddy.

720
00:49:42,809 --> 00:49:45,309
This is Hank.
Nobody knows his last name anymore.

721
00:49:45,310 --> 00:49:47,010
And this is Mr. Regan,
How do you do?

722
00:49:47,011 --> 00:49:49,111
But why can't you sign the contract?

723
00:49:49,112 --> 00:49:50,612
The reason herself.

724
00:49:50,613 --> 00:49:53,513
What has Mrs. McGillicuddy got to do
with the contract?

725
00:49:53,514 --> 00:49:56,014
Of course we don't know what arrangements
you have with her, Terry

726
00:49:56,015 --> 00:49:58,295
but this is a...
Now, look, pulp head, you don't understand.

727
00:49:58,296 --> 00:50:01,596
Rita is my wife.
My real name is McGillicuddy.

728
00:50:01,597 --> 00:50:04,797
And it says in the contract
that I must remain single.

729
00:50:04,798 --> 00:50:07,398
Your wife? But you can't.
You can't have a wife.

730
00:50:07,399 --> 00:50:08,809
But I have and I'm going to keep her.

731
00:50:08,810 --> 00:50:11,010
Look at that thing, darling,
that top clause there... it's silly!

732
00:50:12,411 --> 00:50:16,411
Well, darling, if this is for just one picture
we could go on keeping it a secret.

733
00:50:16,412 --> 00:50:19,112
One picture, it's for seven years.

734
00:50:19,113 --> 00:50:20,813
And look at the dough.

735
00:50:21,314 --> 00:50:22,904
But I have an idea.

736
00:50:22,905 --> 00:50:25,105
This is for so much money,

737
00:50:25,106 --> 00:50:27,406
why couldn't we take less and still be married?

738
00:50:28,607 --> 00:50:30,307
Hang on to yourself, sweetheart.

739
00:50:30,308 --> 00:50:32,408
Now listen, tell me.
What is this all about anyway?

740
00:50:32,409 --> 00:50:34,509
Don't they have married people in Hollywood?

741
00:50:34,510 --> 00:50:36,110
Why a silly clause like that?

742
00:50:36,111 --> 00:50:39,811
Don't you understand? You're the potential
heart interest of every woman in America.

743
00:50:39,812 --> 00:50:41,912
It's your stock-in-trade.
Yes.

744
00:50:41,913 --> 00:50:43,553
Isn't that charming.
You think I can handle it?

745
00:50:43,554 --> 00:50:45,354
Oh, Terry.
Look.

746
00:50:45,355 --> 00:50:49,855
If you think I'm gonna give up this gal
for any movie contract, you are crazy.

747
00:50:49,856 --> 00:50:52,356
You two are very nice and I thank you.

748
00:50:52,357 --> 00:50:55,257
But we are going back where we belong
with the band.

749
00:50:56,759 --> 00:50:58,559
That's very sweet of you, darling.

750
00:50:59,160 --> 00:51:01,360
But this is too important to decide that bet.

751
00:51:03,761 --> 00:51:06,161
Why couldn't I go to Hollywood as just a visitor?

752
00:51:06,162 --> 00:51:09,462
As Mrs. Thaddeus McGillicuddy.

753
00:51:12,163 --> 00:51:15,063
What a moniker. Thaddeus McGillicuddy.

754
00:51:15,064 --> 00:51:16,464
We like it.

755
00:51:16,465 --> 00:51:20,565
Are you kidding, Terry?
No, absolutely on the level.

756
00:51:20,566 --> 00:51:23,566
I'm sorry, Hank,
but it was given to me while I was asleep.

757
00:51:23,567 --> 00:51:26,067
Well, I'm glad you woke up in time to change it.

758
00:51:26,068 --> 00:51:28,468
Well, couldn't I?
Couldn't you what?

759
00:51:28,469 --> 00:51:31,669
Wait a minute.
I think I got it. Come here, B.O. Listen to this.

760
00:51:31,670 --> 00:51:33,170
Come here, Terry.

761
00:51:33,671 --> 00:51:35,671
Would you be willing to go down to Hollywood
and go to work?

762
00:51:35,672 --> 00:51:37,772
I mean, take a job, a cover-up job?

763
00:51:37,773 --> 00:51:39,873
Why, certainly.
That's swell.

764
00:51:39,874 --> 00:51:41,874
Now we have nothing to worry about.
Here's what you do.

765
00:51:41,875 --> 00:51:44,475
You come down to Hollywood as Terry's
confidential secretary.

766
00:51:44,476 --> 00:51:47,376
Take care of all his personal affairs,
fan mail and all that stuff, huh?

767
00:51:47,777 --> 00:51:48,977
Hank...
Would you do that?

768
00:51:48,978 --> 00:51:50,908
Of course, darling.
I think it's marvelous.

769
00:51:50,909 --> 00:51:55,209
You're a genius sometimes.
Sometimes I think I deserve more dough.

770
00:51:55,210 --> 00:51:57,310
All right, come on. Give me the contract.

771
00:51:57,311 --> 00:51:58,211
Here you are, Terry.

772
00:52:11,512 --> 00:52:14,512
Amateur! That nobody!

773
00:52:18,213 --> 00:52:19,713
Hi, Daisy.
How do you do, Mr. Hank?

774
00:52:19,714 --> 00:52:21,214
Glad to see you.

775
00:52:21,215 --> 00:52:23,615
Well, good morning.

776
00:52:23,616 --> 00:52:26,306
How's everything, Snooks?
Don't Snooks me.

777
00:52:26,307 --> 00:52:28,707
What, I ask you, what is that?

778
00:52:28,708 --> 00:52:33,208
What? Why, it's a bungalow.
Yes, I know. But whose?

779
00:52:33,209 --> 00:52:37,509
Whose, why, I don't know. Let me see.
Don't stall with me. You know.

780
00:52:37,510 --> 00:52:39,310
Do I?
It's Terry Rooney's.

781
00:52:39,311 --> 00:52:41,711
Is it?
You know darned well it is.

782
00:52:41,712 --> 00:52:43,812
Five rooms and three baths.

783
00:52:43,813 --> 00:52:46,413
What, I ask you, is he going to do
with three baths?

784
00:52:46,414 --> 00:52:48,114
He's not running a laundry.

785
00:52:48,115 --> 00:52:49,615
Although he should be.

786
00:53:01,116 --> 00:53:03,316
Who lives here?
Mrs. McGillicuddy.

787
00:53:03,317 --> 00:53:07,117
And this is her hideaway.
You remember Mrs. McGillicuddy?

788
00:53:07,118 --> 00:53:08,918
Yes, I have a vague recollection.

789
00:53:08,919 --> 00:53:11,819
And you come to see her.
Oh, do I?

790
00:53:11,820 --> 00:53:14,420
Every night?
No, not every night.

791
00:53:14,421 --> 00:53:16,021
The neighbors might talk.

792
00:53:16,022 --> 00:53:17,622
Who?
The neighbors.

793
00:53:17,623 --> 00:53:19,423
The neighbors.
Hm-hmm.

794
00:53:23,624 --> 00:53:25,224
Who cares for the neighbors?
Shhh!

795
00:53:25,225 --> 00:53:27,805
That'll take care of them.

796
00:53:27,806 --> 00:53:31,606
Why don't you get some lights on in here?
Well, why don't you take off your glasses?

797
00:53:31,607 --> 00:53:34,687
Oh, never thought of that.
You look silly in them anyway.

798
00:53:34,688 --> 00:53:36,388
I suppose I gotta go on wearing these.

799
00:53:36,389 --> 00:53:38,989
Well, Hank thinks it's a good idea.
I see.

800
00:53:40,590 --> 00:53:42,950
Oh, and here's the stairway.

801
00:53:42,951 --> 00:53:45,651
It leads to two of the cutest bedrooms
you ever saw.

802
00:53:45,652 --> 00:53:47,402
How many?
Two.

803
00:53:47,403 --> 00:53:49,703
We can rule out the other one.

804
00:53:50,604 --> 00:53:54,404
So you think I should carry him along, eh?

805
00:53:54,405 --> 00:53:57,405
Help build him up?
Now listen, darling.

806
00:53:57,406 --> 00:53:58,706
You come in with me on this...

807
00:53:58,707 --> 00:54:02,107
and I'll team you with Rooney for more publicity
than you've seen in a year.

808
00:54:02,108 --> 00:54:05,258
Get this. Hollywood's newest  love interest!
Do you like it?

809
00:54:05,259 --> 00:54:07,159
Hm-hmm.
Why, they'll eat it up.

810
00:54:07,160 --> 00:54:09,160
I adore it.
Good!

811
00:54:09,161 --> 00:54:12,361
For Galor.
Good again. I'll get started with the story.

812
00:54:12,362 --> 00:54:15,062
Leave it to me, honey.
Lots of publicity and a good story.

813
00:54:15,063 --> 00:54:16,763
Just leave the whole thing to me.
All for me!

814
00:54:19,764 --> 00:54:21,864
Cut! Cut! Cut!

815
00:54:21,865 --> 00:54:25,065
Steffie, darling, what is the matter?

816
00:54:25,366 --> 00:54:29,766
You're not giving me anything.
Can I make a love scene with a icicle?

817
00:54:29,767 --> 00:54:32,367
He doesn't give me anything. Nothing!

818
00:54:33,968 --> 00:54:36,468
Terry...
Oh, I know, I know it's bad.

819
00:54:36,469 --> 00:54:40,269
Listen, I can give you the scene
if you just get these people off the set.

820
00:54:40,270 --> 00:54:44,370
Imagine that guy getting to have a medal.
Doesn't take long for their heads to start swelling.

821
00:54:44,371 --> 00:54:48,271
That's not so.
Oh, you too, eh?

822
00:54:49,172 --> 00:54:51,772
Listen, don't you go going gaga over that guy.

823
00:54:51,773 --> 00:54:55,373
You're not in his class.
He only goes for stars.

824
00:54:55,374 --> 00:54:57,074
Like Stephanie.

825
00:54:57,075 --> 00:54:59,275
Oh, is that so?

826
00:54:59,276 --> 00:55:00,676
Yes, that's so.

827
00:55:01,577 --> 00:55:04,377
That was no tempering, Blaine.
Something upset me on the set.

828
00:55:04,378 --> 00:55:06,478
I think I can give you the scene now.

829
00:55:06,479 --> 00:55:07,679
All right, Terry, but look.

830
00:55:07,780 --> 00:55:10,480
Warm up to Steffi a little bit.
She needs it.

831
00:55:10,481 --> 00:55:11,481
All right, sure.

832
00:55:13,082 --> 00:55:14,882
Uh, Steffie.
Yes?

833
00:55:14,883 --> 00:55:17,183
Please forgive me for blowing up.

834
00:55:17,184 --> 00:55:20,904
You see, you're such a very great actress
and I'm actually no actor at all.

835
00:55:20,905 --> 00:55:23,505
I never even expected to be on the same set with you.

836
00:55:24,106 --> 00:55:26,806
I guess I'm a little bit scared.

837
00:55:26,807 --> 00:55:29,999
It's so sweet of you to say
those things to me.

838
00:55:30,000 --> 00:55:31,700
Will you go through it once again with me?

839
00:55:32,101 --> 00:55:33,601
I will.

840
00:55:37,002 --> 00:55:38,702
All right. Let's do it once again now.

841
00:55:38,703 --> 00:55:39,803
Come on.

842
00:55:39,804 --> 00:55:41,204
Action!

843
00:55:41,205 --> 00:55:43,305
But I can't give you up like this, darling.

844
00:55:43,306 --> 00:55:47,000
But it is so difficult with things as they are now.

845
00:55:47,001 --> 00:55:49,401
I can't give up hope. It's all I have.

846
00:55:49,402 --> 00:55:53,202
Maybe someday in some faraway place.

847
00:55:53,203 --> 00:55:56,103
No, no. No faraway place, darling.

848
00:55:56,104 --> 00:55:57,804
No faraway place.

849
00:55:57,805 --> 00:55:59,305
Here and now.

850
00:55:59,306 --> 00:56:01,406
Here and now!

851
00:56:10,007 --> 00:56:11,707
Is that what you mean?
Perfect!

852
00:56:12,708 --> 00:56:15,008
The boy has talent.

853
00:56:39,209 --> 00:56:41,209
Sorry, canary, I had to do that to you.

854
00:56:41,210 --> 00:56:42,710
But I had to.

855
00:56:42,711 --> 00:56:47,311
But the only reason I came on the set
is because I haven't seen you for two or three days.

856
00:56:47,312 --> 00:56:48,712
Yeah, I know.

857
00:56:48,713 --> 00:56:52,013
I couldn't play that love scene when I knew
you were there standing watching me.

858
00:56:58,814 --> 00:57:01,304
I had an impulse to drop her
and rush over to you.

859
00:57:07,305 --> 00:57:09,505
Now I want to play a love scene with you.

860
00:57:14,206 --> 00:57:15,496
Now, Terry...

861
00:57:15,497 --> 00:57:16,817
You're not gonna try and run away from me,
are you?

862
00:57:16,818 --> 00:57:19,118
No, but I...
It won't do any good, all the doors are locked.

863
00:57:19,119 --> 00:57:22,559
Someone may look in the window.
The windows can take care of themselves.

864
00:57:22,560 --> 00:57:24,860
But Ito...
Ito's too smart.

865
00:57:29,261 --> 00:57:32,961
Hi, Terry.
Don't you ever knock, chump.

866
00:57:32,962 --> 00:57:36,162
I see you're rehearsing the little scene
you told me about. Looks good too.

867
00:57:36,163 --> 00:57:38,963
A critic, huh?
Well, I'm glad you like it.

868
00:57:38,964 --> 00:57:42,294
Thanks, it certainly does look good.
I'd like to have you know Miss Robbins.

869
00:57:42,295 --> 00:57:43,795
How do you do, Mr. Rooney?

870
00:57:44,596 --> 00:57:47,796
Oh, how do you do, Miss Robbins?
How do you do, I'm very happy to meet you.

871
00:57:49,697 --> 00:57:51,697
We were just going over the fan mail situation.

872
00:57:51,698 --> 00:57:54,098
Oh, I thought it was a rehearsing.

873
00:57:54,099 --> 00:57:55,499
Well, yes and no, you see.

874
00:57:55,500 --> 00:57:58,400
Sometimes they rehearse
while they're running through the fan mail.

875
00:57:58,401 --> 00:58:00,401
Oh, I see.
Yes, I'm glad you do.

876
00:58:00,402 --> 00:58:02,903
Mrs. McGillicuddy, will you run and see if the mail
is ready to sign, please.

877
00:58:02,904 --> 00:58:04,204
Right away. Pardon me.
Thanks.

878
00:58:04,905 --> 00:58:06,605
She's my confidential secretary.

879
00:58:06,606 --> 00:58:08,806
Very confidential, I expect.

880
00:58:08,807 --> 00:58:10,607
You'd be surprised.

881
00:58:10,608 --> 00:58:13,308
And very pretty too.
Yeah, we think so, don't we, Terry?

882
00:58:13,309 --> 00:58:15,509
Well, for a secretary.
But then again the...

883
00:58:15,510 --> 00:58:18,410
average run of girls around here
have very high standards of looks, you know.

884
00:58:18,511 --> 00:58:22,311
If you'll excuse me, I'll run inside
and get out of this collar...

885
00:58:22,312 --> 00:58:25,112
before it cuts my throat.
Go right ahead. Take your time, Terry.

886
00:58:25,113 --> 00:58:29,113
Wait a minute. What are you up to now?
Just a little blind item for my column.

887
00:58:30,214 --> 00:58:34,494
What rising young star was caught
making love to his pretty secretary?

888
00:58:34,495 --> 00:58:37,505
Now listen. If you print that story,
you're going to ruin two lives.

889
00:58:37,506 --> 00:58:39,596
What lives?
Yours and mine.

890
00:58:39,597 --> 00:58:40,197
Oh...

891
00:58:40,198 --> 00:58:42,198
First of all, if you print it,
I'm gonna sock you on the nose.

892
00:58:42,199 --> 00:58:43,000
Oh...

893
00:58:43,001 --> 00:58:45,401
And if I sock you on the nose,
I'm gonna lose my job so figure it out.

894
00:58:44,799 --> 00:58:47,099
But it's a story.

895
00:58:47,100 --> 00:58:49,550
Yeah? Well there's a bigger story
than that around here...

896
00:58:49,551 --> 00:58:51,900
if somebody was bright enough to spot it.
What?

897
00:58:53,601 --> 00:58:54,501
Listen...

898
00:58:54,502 --> 00:58:58,102
do you think Terry Rooney would be fooling around
with a funny little secretary

899
00:58:58,103 --> 00:59:01,503
with a glamorous dame like Stephanie Hajos
here in the studio?

900
00:59:02,504 --> 00:59:07,004
Oh, Hank!
Yeah, you better sharpen your pencil.

901
00:59:09,905 --> 00:59:12,005
That's very interesting.

902
00:59:12,006 --> 00:59:15,606
Now. There's one thing I'm sure
all our readers will want to know.

903
00:59:15,607 --> 00:59:19,907
What is your ideal of feminine beauty?
Well, I er...

904
00:59:19,908 --> 00:59:22,008
That's a funny thing you should ask him
a question like that.

905
00:59:22,009 --> 00:59:24,309
You know, Terry was saying to me only this morning

906
00:59:24,310 --> 00:59:27,710
that his idea of feminine beauty is Stephanie Hajos.

907
00:59:27,711 --> 00:59:31,711
A little less statuesque then Venus de Milo, perhaps.

908
00:59:31,712 --> 00:59:34,712
More delicate, possibly. More flaming.

909
00:59:34,713 --> 00:59:36,913
Am I right, Terrence?
Exactly my words.

910
00:59:36,914 --> 00:59:39,804
In fact, practically verbatim.
How lovely!

911
00:59:39,805 --> 00:59:41,105
Now, Mr. Rooney...

912
00:59:41,106 --> 00:59:44,956
won't you tell me what was your first,
your childhood love?

913
00:59:44,957 --> 00:59:46,107
Well, you see, what Terry...

914
00:59:46,108 --> 00:59:49,508
Oh, Hank, may I handle this one, please?

915
00:59:49,610 --> 00:59:52,999
Well, my first, my childhood love...

916
00:59:53,700 --> 00:59:56,200
That goes way back, way back...

917
00:59:56,201 --> 01:00:00,201
In fact, she was the dog catcher's daughter
in my home town.

918
01:00:00,202 --> 01:00:03,102
And every time my pooch was snatched...
Your what?

919
01:00:03,103 --> 01:00:04,903
Every time they snatched my pooch...

920
01:00:04,904 --> 01:00:07,204
Oh...
She'd get it back to me by hook or by crook.

921
01:00:07,205 --> 01:00:10,705
In fact it happened so often that her old man
began to think my dog was quintuplets.

922
01:00:11,906 --> 01:00:15,106
One of the characteristic things about Terry
is his love for animals.

923
01:00:15,107 --> 01:00:16,707
Particularly dogs.

924
01:00:16,708 --> 01:00:19,999
Please, honorable master,
excuse humble servant.

925
01:00:20,000 --> 01:00:22,000
Oh, they want me on the set?
Thank you, please.

926
01:00:22,001 --> 01:00:24,101
Well, I'm awfully sorry to break up
this luncheon this way

927
01:00:24,102 --> 01:00:26,002
It's was awfully pleasant.
It's been delightful.

928
01:00:26,003 --> 01:00:28,003
You will come again, will you?
Oh, yes, thank you so much.

929
01:00:28,004 --> 01:00:31,004
I've enjoyed it. And anything you want
just call Ito, he's here.

930
01:00:31,005 --> 01:00:33,005
Hank, thanks so much.

931
01:00:34,406 --> 01:00:36,406
What a quaint servant. What's his name?

932
01:00:36,407 --> 01:00:38,007
Uh, Ito.
Ito.

933
01:00:38,008 --> 01:00:39,808
Oh, he adores Terry.

934
01:00:39,809 --> 01:00:43,409
Why, when Terry disappeared we had trouble
restraining Ito from committing Charlie Cary.

935
01:00:43,410 --> 01:00:45,010
Or a Harry Carryl.

936
01:00:45,011 --> 01:00:49,111
Nice interview, huh?
Did you get everything you wanted?

937
01:00:49,112 --> 01:00:50,412
Plenty.

938
01:00:53,413 --> 01:00:56,513
Having Hog's tea?
Hi, Terry boy, how are you feeling?

939
01:00:56,514 --> 01:00:58,414
Oh, fine.
Good. Here's your tickets.

940
01:00:59,015 --> 01:01:00,115
Tickets for what?

941
01:01:00,116 --> 01:01:02,716
Tickets for the opening of part you're playing tonight.
You're taking Stephanie.

942
01:01:02,717 --> 01:01:05,817
Oh, yes?
I'm not going to any opening tonight.

943
01:01:05,818 --> 01:01:07,518
What do you mean you're not going
to any opening?

944
01:01:07,519 --> 01:01:10,119
I am not going to any opening tonight.

945
01:01:10,120 --> 01:01:11,620
I've been working for a week on this.

946
01:01:11,621 --> 01:01:14,321
The reporters, the photographers,
they're all gonna be there. It's important to me!

947
01:01:14,322 --> 01:01:18,122
Now look, you can save yourself all that.
I am not going to any opening.

948
01:01:18,123 --> 01:01:21,623
Oh, stay and let me talk to you,
why do you want to act like this for?

949
01:01:21,624 --> 01:01:22,924
Wait a minute, what about Stephanie?

950
01:01:22,925 --> 01:01:25,125
You can take her and put her
back in the woodwork.

951
01:01:25,126 --> 01:01:28,526
Don't be so unreasonable.
When I say a thing is important it's important.

952
01:01:28,527 --> 01:01:29,727
I can't just stand...
Now look!

953
01:01:29,728 --> 01:01:33,028
I've got a wife and I like her.
And I'm gonna see her once in a while.

954
01:01:33,029 --> 01:01:34,729
Cut out that wife stuff, will you?

955
01:01:35,830 --> 01:01:37,730
I am not going to any opening!

956
01:01:37,731 --> 01:01:41,031
Come here and listen to me, will you?
What do you want to be such a bull head?

957
01:01:44,732 --> 01:01:47,032
Billy, call Mr. Regan on the phone

958
01:01:47,033 --> 01:01:49,083
and tell him to go right over to Rooney's bungalow.
Yes, sir.

959
01:01:49,084 --> 01:01:51,684
That boy's going nuts again.
Get me Mr. Regan's office.

960
01:01:51,685 --> 01:01:53,085
Quick! Certainly it's important.

961
01:01:53,086 --> 01:01:56,386
Now, Terry, why don't you do this for me?
You know what I do for you.

962
01:01:56,387 --> 01:01:59,287
Why, I've worked my head to the bone
to put you on top.

963
01:01:59,288 --> 01:02:02,788
And I'd cut my arm off to...
off to here to keep you there.

964
01:02:02,789 --> 01:02:06,589
Having me run around every night with
Stephanie Hajos is keeping me on top, huh?

965
01:02:06,590 --> 01:02:09,190
Say, what am I, an actor or a stooge?
I'm supposed to be an actor.

966
01:02:09,191 --> 01:02:10,391
Well, at least that's the rumor.

967
01:02:10,392 --> 01:02:12,492
Well, if I'm not good enough,
I can always go back with the band.

968
01:02:12,493 --> 01:02:14,993
And something tells me
I'd be a whole lot happier if I did.

969
01:02:14,994 --> 01:02:18,294
But Terry, you've got a duty to the...
I've got a duty to myself and my wife.

970
01:02:18,295 --> 01:02:21,595
And that fine elaborate scheme you worked up
in San Francisco isn't gonna work either.

971
01:02:21,696 --> 01:02:23,506
It's got me and Rita absolutely insane.

972
01:02:23,507 --> 01:02:28,207
While I'm out to previews, and openings
and cocktail parties and testimonial dinners,

973
01:02:28,208 --> 01:02:29,999
all for the glory of your dear old Galor,

974
01:02:30,009 --> 01:02:31,609
she sits up in the hill swirling her thumbs.

975
01:02:31,610 --> 01:02:34,510
She isn't yelling, is she?
No, she's too good a sport for that,

976
01:02:34,511 --> 01:02:36,811
But I know how she feels and I don't blame her.

977
01:02:37,612 --> 01:02:39,012
He's right, B.O.

978
01:02:41,213 --> 01:02:42,703
Of course he is.

979
01:02:42,704 --> 01:02:45,204
We've been entirely unfair to Rita.

980
01:02:45,205 --> 01:02:48,405
I can see now the whole situation
has been a terrific strain on her.

981
01:02:48,406 --> 01:02:51,306
Terry, will you let me do something?

982
01:02:51,307 --> 01:02:53,007
With your permission, may I?

983
01:02:53,008 --> 01:02:55,108
Hank, get a drawing room to New York.

984
01:02:55,109 --> 01:02:57,509
Wire the office there and get a reservation
to the best hotel

985
01:02:57,510 --> 01:02:59,710
and get tickets for every theater in town.
Right.

986
01:02:59,711 --> 01:03:01,311
For Rita.

987
01:03:02,312 --> 01:03:04,452
Now what kind of a solution is that?
Wait a minute.

988
01:03:04,453 --> 01:03:06,153
That's only half the plan.

989
01:03:06,154 --> 01:03:09,154
Terry, when you finish this picture
I'm going to a four weeks' vacation.

990
01:03:09,155 --> 01:03:11,255
To go to New York and be with Rita.

991
01:03:11,256 --> 01:03:12,956
That's great, B.O.

992
01:03:12,957 --> 01:03:15,257
There you are, Terry.
That solves the problem.

993
01:03:15,258 --> 01:03:16,758
Wait a minute, wait a minute.

994
01:03:17,259 --> 01:03:19,059
Let me understand this.

995
01:03:19,860 --> 01:03:24,000
You promise me four weeks off
after I finish this picture?

996
01:03:24,001 --> 01:03:25,701
Yes.
Four weeks?

997
01:03:26,502 --> 01:03:27,902
Successively?

998
01:03:27,903 --> 01:03:29,703
Successively and positively.

999
01:03:29,704 --> 01:03:31,904
If you go to the opening tonight.

1000
01:03:45,405 --> 01:03:47,105
All right.
That's great.

1001
01:03:51,706 --> 01:03:53,306
Fine, Terry.

1002
01:03:55,607 --> 01:03:57,507
That's swell of you, B.O.

1003
01:03:57,508 --> 01:04:01,208
See what a grand time those two kids
are gonna have on those four weeks.

1004
01:04:02,309 --> 01:04:04,309
What four weeks?

1005
01:04:11,010 --> 01:04:13,010
Every time I put this vest on I think of Regan.

1006
01:04:13,011 --> 01:04:14,811
All front and no back.

1007
01:04:16,612 --> 01:04:18,702
What time do you think you'll be home?

1008
01:04:18,703 --> 01:04:20,803
Oh, I don't know, darling.
You know how these things are.

1009
01:04:21,804 --> 01:04:24,904
I may have to stay in town if I expect
to be on the set at nine in the morning.

1010
01:04:25,605 --> 01:04:27,605
Do you have to go?

1011
01:04:27,606 --> 01:04:29,906
Well, you know, practically a command performance.

1012
01:04:29,907 --> 01:04:32,507
Darling, listen to me.

1013
01:04:32,508 --> 01:04:35,208
This isn't going to work out trying to live this way.

1014
01:04:35,209 --> 01:04:36,409
I know that.

1015
01:04:36,410 --> 01:04:38,610
It's a dog's life for you and...

1016
01:04:38,611 --> 01:04:41,211
I don't mind telling you
that it's getting the best of me.

1017
01:04:41,912 --> 01:04:44,712
It's driving me crazy.
Look, darling. We've got an idea.

1018
01:04:45,313 --> 01:04:46,803
How would you like to go East and visit your mother

1019
01:04:46,804 --> 01:04:48,804
and see the boys while I finish the picture?

1020
01:04:48,805 --> 01:04:51,105
I could join you in, say, three or four weeks

1021
01:04:51,106 --> 01:04:54,006
and then we could go someplace together
where nobody ever heard of pictures.

1022
01:04:55,407 --> 01:04:57,427
All right, if you want me to.
No, wait...

1023
01:04:57,428 --> 01:04:59,828
I didn't say I wanted you to.
I just thought it might be a good idea.

1024
01:04:59,829 --> 01:05:01,529
That's what I mean.

1025
01:05:13,830 --> 01:05:15,390
What are you doing?
I'm not going.

1026
01:05:15,391 --> 01:05:16,891
Oh, yes, you've got to go.

1027
01:05:16,892 --> 01:05:18,792
I am not going!
But you made a promise...

1028
01:05:18,793 --> 01:05:20,293
and you mustn't break it.

1029
01:05:20,294 --> 01:05:21,694
Here, get into this.

1030
01:05:31,195 --> 01:05:32,405
Sure you understand?

1031
01:05:32,806 --> 01:05:34,306
Perfectly.

1032
01:05:48,007 --> 01:05:49,707
I've hurt you, haven't I?

1033
01:05:49,708 --> 01:05:50,708
No.

1034
01:05:50,999 --> 01:05:53,409
Well, you don't like the idea of going East.

1035
01:05:53,410 --> 01:05:56,810
I really haven't given it much thought.
You said you wanted me to go...

1036
01:05:56,811 --> 01:05:58,611
I did not say I wanted you to go.

1037
01:05:58,612 --> 01:06:00,212
Oh, I must have misunderstood.

1038
01:06:00,213 --> 01:06:02,803
All I meant to say was that Regan promised
if I went to the opening tonight,

1039
01:06:02,804 --> 01:06:05,904
you could go East and I could possibly
join you later. That's all!

1040
01:06:05,905 --> 01:06:08,305
Well, then, by all means go!

1041
01:06:09,006 --> 01:06:11,106
What is the matter with us?
Here we are standing here arguing

1042
01:06:11,107 --> 01:06:12,907
like a couple of children over nothing at all.

1043
01:06:12,908 --> 01:06:16,408
No, nothing. You've arranged
for me to go East, that's all.

1044
01:06:16,409 --> 01:06:17,609
And I'm going.

1045
01:06:17,910 --> 01:06:23,610
I did not arrange for you to go East!
Oh, put on your coat and go to your opening.

1046
01:06:23,611 --> 01:06:27,011
I have a lot of packing to do anyway,
and you'd only be in the way if you stayed.

1047
01:06:27,012 --> 01:06:28,412
I probably would.

1048
01:07:07,013 --> 01:07:08,413
Hi, canary.

1049
01:07:26,214 --> 01:07:29,514
Well, Rita, hello, how have you been?
Where have you been?

1050
01:07:29,515 --> 01:07:31,815
Oh, just a little trip to California.

1051
01:07:31,816 --> 01:07:33,916
I see the boys are still here.

1052
01:07:33,917 --> 01:07:36,217
Yes, they're still here.

1053
01:07:36,218 --> 01:07:38,218
Why I don't know. Look at this business.

1054
01:07:39,419 --> 01:07:41,619
Do you mind if I go up and say hello to them?

1055
01:07:41,620 --> 01:07:43,620
No, no, go right ahead.

1056
01:07:43,621 --> 01:07:47,021
Rita, stop in my office and see me
before you go, will you?

1057
01:07:47,022 --> 01:07:48,322
Thank you.

1058
01:08:23,723 --> 01:08:26,023
Who's doing that?
Somebody's singing.

1059
01:08:26,024 --> 01:08:28,124
Sounds like Rita's voice.

1060
01:08:32,325 --> 01:08:35,525
<i>I want to croon</i>

1061
01:08:35,526 --> 01:08:43,825
???

1062
01:08:43,826 --> 01:08:50,126
<i>Then I found you</i>

1063
01:08:50,525 --> 01:08:53,825
<i>it was love from the start</i>

1064
01:08:53,826 --> 01:08:58,026
<i>and I traded my heart</i>

1065
01:08:58,027 --> 01:09:02,527
<i>for an angel</i>

1066
01:09:02,528 --> 01:09:12,428
<i>from out of the blue.</i>

1067
01:09:17,025 --> 01:09:20,225
Rita, when did you get back?
So glad to see you!

1068
01:09:21,826 --> 01:09:24,526
Mr. Richards, can we have five minutes, please?

1069
01:09:24,527 --> 01:09:26,727
Can you have five minutes?
You're taking it, aren't you?

1070
01:09:26,728 --> 01:09:28,128
Go on back and get your hellos over.

1071
01:09:29,129 --> 01:09:32,029
Baby, when I heard that voice
I knew who it was right away.

1072
01:09:32,030 --> 01:09:33,230
Boy, am I happy.

1073
01:09:36,031 --> 01:09:38,131
Is she coming back to sing with the band?

1074
01:09:38,132 --> 01:09:39,732
We ought to ask her to.

1075
01:09:39,733 --> 01:09:42,533
Yes, I saw Terry in Hollywood.

1076
01:09:42,534 --> 01:09:44,934
Everything is coming along beautifully for him

1077
01:09:44,935 --> 01:09:46,935
and he's coming East in about four weeks.

1078
01:09:46,936 --> 01:09:50,436
Is there any truth to the stories the paper
about him and that Hajos dame?

1079
01:09:50,437 --> 01:09:52,837
Just a lot of press agent drool.

1080
01:09:52,838 --> 01:09:55,838
You're sure?
Well, I know the press agent.

1081
01:09:55,839 --> 01:09:59,239
Boy, I'm sure glad to hear that. We were all
beginning to get worried, weren't we?

1082
01:09:59,240 --> 01:10:02,940
Yeah, we thought... well, you know what he said
when he left the band.

1083
01:10:02,941 --> 01:10:05,741
About you being on the West Coast and everything...

1084
01:10:05,742 --> 01:10:07,742
Stop kicking me, will you?

1085
01:10:07,743 --> 01:10:12,243
Well, I guess I'd better go in
and get the piano warmed up...

1086
01:10:16,544 --> 01:10:18,244
Telling her isn't going to be easy, you know.

1087
01:10:18,245 --> 01:10:20,445
But you must.

1088
01:10:22,246 --> 01:10:24,046
I can't stand the idea of hurting her.

1089
01:10:24,047 --> 01:10:28,547
We have reached the point where you and I
are the only things that matter.

1090
01:10:30,248 --> 01:10:32,948
That's the way I feel, you know that, don't you?

1091
01:10:32,949 --> 01:10:33,949
Hm?

1092
01:10:43,550 --> 01:10:44,850
Cut!

1093
01:10:44,851 --> 01:10:47,251
That's swell.
Print that!

1094
01:10:47,252 --> 01:10:49,552
Can that pair play a love scene?

1095
01:10:49,553 --> 01:10:50,953
Why not?

1096
01:10:53,254 --> 01:10:56,804
Terry, I'm proud of you.
Those pear-shaped vowels were perfect.

1097
01:10:56,805 --> 01:10:59,005
Bless your hearts, children,
I could kiss you both.

1098
01:10:59,006 --> 01:11:01,156
Don't you kiss me.
I'll let Steffi do it for me.

1099
01:11:01,157 --> 01:11:02,657
Why, gladly.

1100
01:11:02,658 --> 01:11:04,958
I think we are wonderful.
No doubt about it.

1101
01:11:04,959 --> 01:11:07,159
Come on, let's go in and say hello to Terry.

1102
01:11:07,160 --> 01:11:08,660
Hello, Mr. Rooney.
Hello.

1103
01:11:08,661 --> 01:11:11,261
Amy, darling!
Hello, Steffi.

1104
01:11:11,262 --> 01:11:13,762
That last scene was a knockout.

1105
01:11:13,763 --> 01:11:15,263
You liked it?

1106
01:11:15,264 --> 01:11:17,564
Terry, you know Miss Robbins, of course.
Yes, sure.

1107
01:11:17,565 --> 01:11:19,165
We'll book for an interview Sunday.

1108
01:11:19,166 --> 01:11:22,666
Sunday?
Oh, yes, that's right. Sunday it is.

1109
01:11:22,667 --> 01:11:25,367
We'll have a good long gab this time.
Very happy to see you.

1110
01:11:25,368 --> 01:11:27,568
If you'll excuse me, I gotta go change my tie.

1111
01:11:27,569 --> 01:11:28,569
Bye-bye.

1112
01:11:29,970 --> 01:11:32,390
Miss Robbins, wouldn't you like to sit down?
How's the play coming?

1113
01:11:32,391 --> 01:11:35,571
Excuse me, Mr. Blaine,
I'm going to steal Amy from you.

1114
01:11:35,572 --> 01:11:36,672
Oh, yes, of course.

1115
01:11:36,673 --> 01:11:39,073
Amy, will you come with me
while I fix my makeup?

1116
01:11:39,074 --> 01:11:41,474
You have an interview with me today.

1117
01:11:41,475 --> 01:11:45,775
I have something most exciting to tell you.
Why, Steffi!

1118
01:11:45,776 --> 01:11:48,376
Something about Terry and me.

1119
01:12:06,678 --> 01:12:08,178
Where does it go from here?

1120
01:12:08,179 --> 01:12:11,579
Fine bunch of musicians.
Have a girl run your band.

1121
01:12:11,680 --> 01:12:14,780
Oh, I guess we missed her.
We miss Terry too, of course, but...

1122
01:12:14,781 --> 01:12:18,381
Terry? You can kiss him goodbye.
He's cooked.

1123
01:12:18,382 --> 01:12:20,382
What do you mean?
Haven't you seen the paper?

1124
01:12:20,383 --> 01:12:21,383
No.

1125
01:12:21,384 --> 01:12:22,904
What's the matter? Is he hurt?

1126
01:12:26,105 --> 01:12:29,005
Stephanie Hajos reveals engagement to Rooney.

1127
01:12:29,006 --> 01:12:33,306
Sensational dancing star and exotic actress
plan to make their real romance real...

1128
01:12:33,307 --> 01:12:34,907
when their current picture ends.

1129
01:12:34,908 --> 01:12:37,408
I thought something terrible had happened.

1130
01:12:37,409 --> 01:12:39,009
This is just more silly stuff.

1131
01:12:39,010 --> 01:12:41,010
Doesn't look like silly stuff there.

1132
01:12:41,011 --> 01:12:45,211
Don't be ridiculous. Besides, it's impossible
for him to be engaged to Steffi.

1133
01:12:45,212 --> 01:12:46,712
Why is it impossible?

1134
01:12:46,713 --> 01:12:47,999
Because we...

1135
01:12:49,000 --> 01:12:52,100
Well, we hadn't intended telling you
until he came East but...

1136
01:12:53,001 --> 01:12:54,401
we're married.

1137
01:12:54,402 --> 01:12:56,402
Married? Why didn't you tell us?

1138
01:12:56,403 --> 01:12:59,003
We thought you were working out there.

1139
01:12:59,004 --> 01:13:03,004
Hey, wait a minute. How can they print
about him being engaged to her...

1140
01:13:03,005 --> 01:13:04,605
when all the time he's married to you?

1141
01:13:04,606 --> 01:13:07,306
That's what I've been trying to tell you.

1142
01:13:11,907 --> 01:13:12,807
Give me that!

1143
01:13:13,508 --> 01:13:15,708
All right, take your places, girls, please.

1144
01:13:15,709 --> 01:13:16,809
Come on.

1145
01:13:16,810 --> 01:13:18,710
Oh, come on, girls, please.

1146
01:13:18,711 --> 01:13:21,501
Blaine.
Just a minute, Hank, please.

1147
01:13:21,502 --> 01:13:23,502
I wanna talk to you, Blaine.

1148
01:13:23,503 --> 01:13:26,003
All right, what is it?
Relax, girls.

1149
01:13:26,004 --> 01:13:27,804
You've seen this, haven't you?
What?

1150
01:13:31,305 --> 01:13:34,205
Well, she certainly laid it on thick.

1151
01:13:34,206 --> 01:13:35,606
Yeah, but you can read that later.
Now, listen.

1152
01:13:35,607 --> 01:13:38,607
Nobody has got to Terry with this yet
and nobody's gonna get to him.

1153
01:13:38,608 --> 01:13:40,308
I've got both doors guarded.

1154
01:13:40,309 --> 01:13:43,009
That boy'll kill me if he sees this story.
Why should he kill you?

1155
01:13:43,010 --> 01:13:44,810
As a publicity gag it's all right.

1156
01:13:44,811 --> 01:13:47,211
Yeah, but there's a lot more than you can see,
you can take my word for that.

1157
01:13:47,212 --> 01:13:49,802
Murder is the least he'll do to me.
Where's Stephanie?

1158
01:13:49,803 --> 01:13:51,103
I don't know. she's not working today.

1159
01:13:51,104 --> 01:13:52,804
I know that.
Did she happen to say where she's gone?

1160
01:13:52,805 --> 01:13:53,705
No.

1161
01:13:53,706 --> 01:13:56,206
Well, she's not home and I've paged
every beauty shop in Hollywood.

1162
01:13:56,207 --> 01:13:58,607
The girls already in waiting?
Oh, yes, please.

1163
01:14:00,708 --> 01:14:03,408
Well, well.
Very cute.

1164
01:14:03,809 --> 01:14:07,009
Very cute.
Oh, do you like it?

1165
01:14:07,510 --> 01:14:09,110
Oh, Mr. Blaine.
Hm?

1166
01:14:09,111 --> 01:14:12,311
Is this the one I'm supposed to marry?
Oh, no!

1167
01:14:13,612 --> 01:14:14,902
My luck.

1168
01:14:14,903 --> 01:14:16,103
Hi, kid, how goes it?

1169
01:14:16,104 --> 01:14:18,504
Well, what dirty press agent trick
are you up to now?

1170
01:14:18,505 --> 01:14:21,405
No, you're wrong.
I'm working on a high spiritual plane.

1171
01:14:21,406 --> 01:14:23,496
I'm praying, my boy.
Praying, huh?

1172
01:14:23,497 --> 01:14:25,407
You'll never know how hard I'm praying.
How nice for you.

1173
01:14:25,408 --> 01:14:27,108
Well, what's doing?
Who's murdering who today?

1174
01:14:27,109 --> 01:14:30,409
Oh, nobody murdered anybody. Gimme that.
I'm doing a crossword puzzle.

1175
01:14:30,410 --> 01:14:32,300
I'll get you another one.
You ain't mad, are you?

1176
01:14:32,301 --> 01:14:33,451
No.
All right.

1177
01:14:33,452 --> 01:14:35,252
I'm ready whenever you are.
All right, Terry.

1178
01:14:35,253 --> 01:14:37,853
My dear Terry, I want to be the first
to congratulate you.

1179
01:14:37,854 --> 01:14:39,354
On what?
On what?!

1180
01:14:39,355 --> 01:14:40,655
Get out of here!

1181
01:14:40,656 --> 01:14:41,756
What is this?

1182
01:14:41,757 --> 01:14:44,097
It's B.O.'s orders that you're not
to be disturbed while you're working.

1183
01:14:44,098 --> 01:14:45,698
He oughta know better than that.

1184
01:14:45,699 --> 01:14:47,499
Congratulations, Terry, my boy!

1185
01:14:49,000 --> 01:14:50,400
Say, what is the matter with you?

1186
01:14:50,401 --> 01:14:52,701
There's nothing the matter with me.
It's an old superstition...

1187
01:14:52,702 --> 01:14:55,502
that an actor can't be congratulated
until his picture is finished.

1188
01:14:55,503 --> 01:14:57,503
He oughta know that.
Mr. Rooney...

1189
01:14:57,504 --> 01:14:59,004
He's out?
Yeah, he's out cold.

1190
01:14:59,005 --> 01:15:01,075
Take him outside and give him a little air.
That's all he needs.

1191
01:15:01,076 --> 01:15:03,676
I brought it for your scrap book...

1192
01:15:03,677 --> 01:15:04,877
Wait a...

1193
01:15:06,078 --> 01:15:07,578
So this is what you've been doing.

1194
01:15:07,579 --> 01:15:10,679
You're trying to keep this from me.
I'm not trying to keep anything from you, Terry.

1195
01:15:10,680 --> 01:15:12,780
My word of honor.
I've nothing to do with this.

1196
01:15:12,781 --> 01:15:15,281
Your idea of publicity.
My idea of nothing.

1197
01:15:15,282 --> 01:15:17,682
Take my word for it, Terry.
I have nothing to do with it.

1198
01:15:18,583 --> 01:15:21,883
Nothing to do with it.
And I thought you were my friend.

1199
01:15:21,884 --> 01:15:23,704
I am your friend.
Let me explain a thing to you.

1200
01:15:23,705 --> 01:15:25,805
I haven't anything to do with that,
you gotta believe me.

1201
01:15:25,806 --> 01:15:27,206
Let me explain it to you!

1202
01:15:27,207 --> 01:15:28,807
Will you go away?

1203
01:15:34,008 --> 01:15:35,208
Where's Ito?

1204
01:15:35,410 --> 01:15:36,710
Ito!

1205
01:15:36,711 --> 01:15:37,711
Ito...

1206
01:15:37,712 --> 01:15:41,312
Follow Mr. Rooney to his bungalow
and beg him to stay there till I come, will you?

1207
01:15:41,313 --> 01:15:42,313
Yes, sir.

1208
01:15:42,314 --> 01:15:44,514
What a day and what a life!

1209
01:15:45,515 --> 01:15:47,115
Mr. Hank, Mr. Hank!

1210
01:15:47,116 --> 01:15:49,999
Miss Hajos just drove up to her bungalow.
Miss Hajos?

1211
01:15:50,000 --> 01:15:51,900
That lets me out.
Hold everything!

1212
01:15:54,501 --> 01:15:56,301
See you later, Daisy, you're excused.

1213
01:15:56,302 --> 01:15:59,102
I don't know whether to kill you for that story or...

1214
01:15:59,403 --> 01:16:01,303
kiss you for showing up.
How dare you!

1215
01:16:00,404 --> 01:16:04,304
Oh, don't give me that
how dare you stuff today, Steffie.

1216
01:16:04,305 --> 01:16:08,005
You got me in a jam.
I only did what you told me to do.

1217
01:16:08,006 --> 01:16:11,306
I got Galor Studio a million dollars' worth of publicity.

1218
01:16:11,307 --> 01:16:13,607
I certainly didn't tell you to say
you were engaged.

1219
01:16:13,608 --> 01:16:18,708
Do you mean to tell me that he objects
to being engaged to me for a few weeks?

1220
01:16:18,709 --> 01:16:21,509
Objects? He does nothing but object!

1221
01:16:21,510 --> 01:16:25,610
I, Stephanie Hajos, the great star,

1222
01:16:25,611 --> 01:16:29,511
condescends to link my name with this hoofer?

1223
01:16:29,512 --> 01:16:32,102
And he objects? He objects?

1224
01:16:32,103 --> 01:16:35,003
I won't speak to him again.
I won't even finish the picture.

1225
01:16:35,004 --> 01:16:37,704
Tell him in public I am through.
Oh, you're through all right.

1226
01:16:37,705 --> 01:16:39,605
Unless you go with me to Terry Rooney's house

1227
01:16:39,606 --> 01:16:41,906
and tell him you're responsible for this.

1228
01:16:41,907 --> 01:16:44,807
You'll go if I have to drag you by the hair of the head.

1229
01:16:44,808 --> 01:16:46,608
You can't talk to me like this.

1230
01:16:46,609 --> 01:16:48,509
I never wanted to smack a woman, but...

1231
01:16:48,610 --> 01:16:50,310
I'm awful close to it right now.

1232
01:16:50,311 --> 01:16:52,311
Go ahead and strike me, you woman striker.

1233
01:16:53,612 --> 01:16:57,512
Oh, Steffie, I didn't want to have to tell you this,
but I suppose I'll have to.

1234
01:16:57,513 --> 01:16:59,613
The boy is married.

1235
01:17:01,414 --> 01:17:07,214
But why don't you tell me things like this?
Because we were trying to keep it a secret.

1236
01:17:07,215 --> 01:17:10,515
Trying? It seems to me you have succeeded.

1237
01:17:10,516 --> 01:17:13,216
Now, you don't want to hurt
Terry and his wife, do you?

1238
01:17:13,217 --> 01:17:16,717
I don't want to hurt anyone.
I've been hurt so many many times.

1239
01:17:16,718 --> 01:17:19,218
I know what it is to be hurt.

1240
01:17:19,219 --> 01:17:21,309
I will go with you.

1241
01:17:21,310 --> 01:17:23,010
But please...

1242
01:17:23,011 --> 01:17:26,311
Please don't scold me anymore.

1243
01:17:26,312 --> 01:17:29,012
Oh, darling, you're a haywire dame.

1244
01:17:29,013 --> 01:17:30,913
But I love you.

1245
01:17:30,914 --> 01:17:33,114
Come on, let's get out of here.

1246
01:17:36,015 --> 01:17:37,895
Come on, Steffie.
We want Mr. Rooney.

1247
01:17:37,896 --> 01:17:39,696
Terry!
Terry Rooney!

1248
01:17:39,697 --> 01:17:42,197
Where is he?
Honorable master, he no home.

1249
01:17:42,198 --> 01:17:44,398
Cut off the honorable master stuff.
He's no home, huh?

1250
01:17:44,399 --> 01:17:45,899
Any idea where he went?

1251
01:17:45,900 --> 01:17:47,800
No, sir, please.
Did you phone the studio?

1252
01:17:47,801 --> 01:17:49,101
No, sir, please.

1253
01:17:50,202 --> 01:17:52,702
What good are you around here?
No, sir, please.

1254
01:17:52,703 --> 01:17:53,903
No, sir...

1255
01:17:54,304 --> 01:17:55,904
Hello, give me the gate.

1256
01:17:55,905 --> 01:17:57,605
Why didn't you follow him
when he left the stage?

1257
01:17:57,606 --> 01:17:59,206
No, sir, please.
No, sir...

1258
01:17:59,207 --> 01:18:01,007
Has Terry Rooney come back to the lot?

1259
01:18:02,908 --> 01:18:05,008
What don't you do something?
No, sir, please.

1260
01:18:05,009 --> 01:18:08,009
Why don't you beat it?
I resent your tone.

1261
01:18:08,010 --> 01:18:11,210
I came out to Hollywood to be an actor,
not a servant.

1262
01:18:11,311 --> 01:18:15,011
I shall go. In your own vulgarism,
I shall beat it and I shall not come back.

1263
01:18:15,012 --> 01:18:16,512
I bid you good day.

1264
01:18:16,513 --> 01:18:20,213
Did you....
I bid you good day.

1265
01:18:21,314 --> 01:18:23,714
Oh, grand pappy's cracking up under the strain.

1266
01:18:23,715 --> 01:18:26,415
I fear poor old grand pappy's going nuts.

1267
01:18:26,416 --> 01:18:29,616
Get on the wire, Rita, will you?
Rita, will you please call him?

1268
01:18:29,617 --> 01:18:33,017
All right. If it'll make you fellas any happier.

1269
01:18:34,418 --> 01:18:37,318
You'd think he was your husband instead of mine.

1270
01:18:37,319 --> 01:18:39,719
Am I worried?
No, I'm not worried, but you're...

1271
01:18:39,720 --> 01:18:45,420
Hello, I want to put in a person-to-person call
to Terry Rooney at the Galor Studios in Hollywood.

1272
01:18:45,601 --> 01:18:46,921
Yes.

1273
01:18:46,922 --> 01:18:49,922
You're going to see how ridiculous all this is.

1274
01:18:49,923 --> 01:18:51,523
Imagine doubting Terry.

1275
01:18:51,524 --> 01:18:53,704
I thought he was gonna get us in his second picture.

1276
01:18:53,705 --> 01:18:56,405
Oh, but Candy, it wasn't that kind of a picture.

1277
01:18:56,406 --> 01:18:59,999
There wasn't a band in it.
Every picture's got a band in it.

1278
01:19:00,000 --> 01:19:01,500
A least a fiddle.

1279
01:19:01,999 --> 01:19:02,999
No?

1280
01:19:03,800 --> 01:19:08,200
Well then, try Hollywood 12521.

1281
01:19:08,501 --> 01:19:09,701
Yes.

1282
01:19:09,702 --> 01:19:13,702
That's our hideaway.
It's the cutest little house.

1283
01:19:24,703 --> 01:19:25,803
Hello?

1284
01:19:25,804 --> 01:19:28,804
Hello? Is Mr. Terry Rooney there?

1285
01:19:32,405 --> 01:19:36,105
Who is this speaking?
This is a friend of his.

1286
01:19:41,306 --> 01:19:42,706
Hello?

1287
01:19:43,307 --> 01:19:44,707
What's the matter, Rita?

1288
01:19:45,308 --> 01:19:46,808
You win.

1289
01:19:46,809 --> 01:19:49,009
That was Stephanie Hajos at the house.

1290
01:19:49,910 --> 01:19:51,410
Gee, I'm sorry, chicken.

1291
01:19:51,411 --> 01:19:54,811
Don't be.
I can't stand people being sorry for me.

1292
01:19:57,112 --> 01:19:58,912
At our hideaway.

1293
01:20:00,413 --> 01:20:02,513
He took her to our house.

1294
01:20:04,014 --> 01:20:05,514
Our house.

1295
01:20:06,815 --> 01:20:09,515
It's like the old saying.
As you sow...

1296
01:20:09,516 --> 01:20:10,916
So what?

1297
01:20:12,317 --> 01:20:13,517
I'll get it.

1298
01:20:14,718 --> 01:20:17,318
Hello, Mr. Richards.
Well, how are you boys?

1299
01:20:17,319 --> 01:20:20,219
Would you really like to know?
Yes, and how's the little lady?

1300
01:20:20,220 --> 01:20:22,320
Oh, swell, she's fine.

1301
01:20:23,121 --> 01:20:25,801
Well, hello there. I'm glad to see you.

1302
01:20:25,802 --> 01:20:27,402
We finally got the break at last.

1303
01:20:27,403 --> 01:20:29,803
It's on the front page of every newspaper in town

1304
01:20:29,804 --> 01:20:32,804
that Mrs. Terry Rooney is singing at the Palomino Roof.

1305
01:20:33,005 --> 01:20:35,205
How did you know I was Mrs. Terry Rooney?

1306
01:20:35,206 --> 01:20:38,006
Well, I overheard you telling the boys
on the stage and uh...

1307
01:20:38,007 --> 01:20:43,007
while I was standing in the bar a newspaper man,
a friend of mine, overheard me mention it.

1308
01:20:43,008 --> 01:20:46,108
Well, Mrs. Terry Rooney is not singing
at the Palomino Roof.

1309
01:20:46,109 --> 01:20:49,209
Oh, now listen, girlie...
And don't call me girlie.

1310
01:20:49,610 --> 01:20:53,410
If you think you can use us just because
you overheard what I was telling the boys,

1311
01:20:53,411 --> 01:20:55,111
you're wrong.
Now listen.

1312
01:20:55,112 --> 01:20:57,712
For one night only. Just for tonight.

1313
01:20:57,713 --> 01:20:59,813
I'll give you a thousand dollars.

1314
01:20:59,814 --> 01:21:03,814
Every table has been reserved by telephone.
We sold out before we opened.

1315
01:21:03,815 --> 01:21:06,115
There'll be a riot if Mrs. Terry Rooney doesn't appear.

1316
01:21:07,116 --> 01:21:09,016
Get out.
Oh, now, listen...

1317
01:21:09,017 --> 01:21:12,507
She said out.
And, brother, she don't mean in.

1318
01:21:13,208 --> 01:21:15,408
Oh, so that's the way it is, huh?

1319
01:21:15,409 --> 01:21:18,209
Well, now let me tell you fellows something.

1320
01:21:18,210 --> 01:21:21,610
You get down there and get those instruments
before they hit the ash can.

1321
01:21:22,711 --> 01:21:24,511
Boys, you'd better go with him.

1322
01:21:24,512 --> 01:21:27,702
Will you be all right?
Just sit tight, chicken. Everything's gonna be all right.

1323
01:21:27,703 --> 01:21:29,503
I'm gonna get my flute...

1324
01:21:37,904 --> 01:21:40,404
Mr. Rooney, may I congratulate you?

1325
01:21:40,405 --> 01:21:42,505
I hope you'll have a lot of happiness.

1326
01:21:45,106 --> 01:21:46,506
Is something the matter?

1327
01:21:46,807 --> 01:21:49,207
Is there anything I can do for you?

1328
01:21:49,508 --> 01:21:53,108
No, thank you.
I can't think of anything that would help.

1329
01:21:53,409 --> 01:21:54,509
Oh.

1330
01:21:59,610 --> 01:22:01,610
Well, do you still want us?

1331
01:22:01,611 --> 01:22:04,711
Do I still...
It'll cost you 2 thousand bucks for the night

1332
01:22:04,712 --> 01:22:07,412
and we knock off at 12:30.
Oh, listen to reason.

1333
01:22:07,413 --> 01:22:09,213
Give us a quick yes or no.

1334
01:22:10,014 --> 01:22:11,999
Yes.
And in advance.

1335
01:22:12,000 --> 01:22:15,400
Boys, you can trust me.
And in advance too.

1336
01:22:15,401 --> 01:22:17,901
Okay, Maurice!
Maurice, hurry up.

1337
01:22:17,902 --> 01:22:20,202
Get those waiters ready.
Get some more tables and the flowers.

1338
01:22:20,203 --> 01:22:22,803
Let's see. You want eight uppers,
eight lowers and a compartment, right?

1339
01:22:22,804 --> 01:22:25,104
No compartment. I'll take a lower.

1340
01:22:25,105 --> 01:22:27,205
All right. Go on, boys. Get ready.

1341
01:22:45,706 --> 01:22:48,406
Ladies and gentlemen,
may I have your attention, please?

1342
01:22:48,807 --> 01:22:52,507
I take great pleasure in personally introducing to you

1343
01:22:52,508 --> 01:22:54,308
Mrs. Terry Rooney.

1344
01:23:14,309 --> 01:23:18,509
<i>Right or wrong</i>

1345
01:23:18,510 --> 01:23:21,999
<i>this I know.</i>

1346
01:23:22,000 --> 01:23:29,311
<i>love is just like a strong undertow</i>

1347
01:23:29,912 --> 01:23:36,212
<i>that takes me wherever you go.</i>

1348
01:23:40,913 --> 01:23:43,313
<i>right or wrong.</i>

1349
01:23:43,314 --> 01:23:49,814
<i>I've never seen the moon</i>

1350
01:23:49,815 --> 01:23:54,715
<i>out shining in the sky.</i>

1351
01:23:54,716 --> 01:23:59,516
<i>But why do I want to cry?</i>

1352
01:23:59,517 --> 01:24:05,117
<i>I guess it's just 'cause I</i>

1353
01:24:05,118 --> 01:24:06,918
<i>can't convince...</i>

1354
01:24:06,919 --> 01:24:11,019
All these are going to car 43 down at the station.
The trunks are down there already.

1355
01:24:11,020 --> 01:24:13,320
All right. I'll get a couple of men to help me.

1356
01:24:14,521 --> 01:24:21,021
<i>that's what loving you is for me.</i>

1357
01:24:21,022 --> 01:24:28,222
<i>I love you, I do.</i>

1358
01:24:28,223 --> 01:24:33,723
<i>My whole life is yours.</i>

1359
01:24:33,724 --> 01:24:38,824
<i>The reason for my smile,</i>

1360
01:24:38,825 --> 01:24:45,025
<i>for loving all the while.</i>

1361
01:24:46,526 --> 01:24:47,526
All right.

1362
01:24:47,527 --> 01:24:50,427
Hello, Holly. Who's doing all the travelling?

1363
01:24:50,428 --> 01:24:51,928
We all are. We're getting out of here.

1364
01:24:51,929 --> 01:24:54,229
Where's Rita?
She's on, doing her number.

1365
01:24:54,999 --> 01:24:56,950
She's going along with us.

1366
01:24:56,951 --> 01:24:59,351
Wait a minute, Terry, I wouldn't interfere.
She's made up her mind.

1367
01:24:59,352 --> 01:25:01,202
Made her mind on what?
About getting out of here.

1368
01:25:01,203 --> 01:25:04,203
Now look, you go in there
and tell the boys to start my music.

1369
01:25:04,204 --> 01:25:07,704
I can't do that, Terry. She told me...
Get in there and tell the boys to star my music!

1370
01:25:07,705 --> 01:25:08,705
Come on!

1371
01:25:12,006 --> 01:25:21,606
<i>I've learned it from your own lips.</i>

1372

<i>Though life may be heaven or hell</i>

1373
01:25:26,208 --> 01:25:29,208
<i>I'll string along</i>

01:25:29,209 --> 01:25:34,809

1375
01:26:27,310 --> 01:26:29,110
Hit it, you cats.

1376
01:26:40,611 --> 01:26:42,411
Come on, canary, get into your cage.
