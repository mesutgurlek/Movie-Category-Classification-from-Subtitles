1
00:00:02,518 --> 00:00:05,122
Are you sure about this, Scootaloo?

2
00:00:05,463 --> 00:00:08,582
I've never even heard
of a pony zip lining before.

3
00:00:09,142 --> 00:00:12,187
Neither have I, but Spike told me it was awesome!

4
00:00:29,086 --> 00:00:30,483
See anything?

5
00:00:33,362 --> 00:00:36,754
Tree sap and pine needles, but no cutie mark.

6
00:00:37,206 --> 00:00:38,520
Plan B?

7
00:00:39,388 --> 00:00:42,965
Yeah. You know where we can find
a cannon at this hour?

8
00:00:45,803 --> 00:00:47,075
It's no use!

9
00:00:47,076 --> 00:00:50,516
No matter what we try, we always
end up without our cutie marks.

10
00:00:51,016 --> 00:00:54,097
And surprisingly often covered in tree sap.

11
00:00:54,266 --> 00:00:56,547
Maybe we should do something less dangerous.

12
00:00:56,548 --> 00:00:57,891
Like pillow testing.

13
00:00:57,892 --> 00:00:59,360
Or flower sniffing.

14
00:01:01,584 --> 00:01:04,235
This town is full of ponies,
who have their cutie marks.

15
00:01:04,236 --> 00:01:06,109
Why don't we ask them how they did it?

16
00:01:06,502 --> 00:01:08,767
That's a great *safe* idea.

17
00:01:09,603 --> 00:01:12,697
Yeah! And we can start with
the coolest pony in Ponyville.

18
00:01:13,189 --> 00:01:14,970
-Applejack!
-Rarity!

19
00:01:14,982 --> 00:01:17,287
Come on, guys, I said "cool"!

20
00:01:17,288 --> 00:01:18,705
You know who I'm talking about.

21
00:01:18,706 --> 00:01:20,913
She's fast. She's tough.

22
00:01:21,141 --> 00:01:23,009
She's not afraid of anything!

23
00:01:23,894 --> 00:01:25,216
Pinkie Pie?

24
00:01:25,717 --> 00:01:29,051
No! The greatest flyer ever
to come out of Cloudsdale.

25
00:01:29,440 --> 00:01:30,697
Fluttershy?

26
00:01:30,832 --> 00:01:33,012
No! Rainbow Dash!

27
00:01:33,480 --> 00:01:36,110
Oh! Yeah, that makes much more sense.

28
00:01:36,111 --> 00:01:37,095
Of course!

29
00:01:37,227 --> 00:01:40,539
Let's do it. Let's find how
Rainbow Dash earned her cutie mark!

30
00:01:40,540 --> 00:01:41,466
YEAH!

31
00:02:31,896 --> 00:02:34,102
Get back here, you thievin' vermins!

32
00:02:34,550 --> 00:02:35,645
Thievin' what now?

33
00:02:39,667 --> 00:02:40,766
Apple Bloom?

34
00:02:42,508 --> 00:02:44,875
Hey sis! How'd you get your cutie mark?

35
00:02:46,097 --> 00:02:47,741
I never told you that story?

36
00:02:48,343 --> 00:02:50,718
Hey! I thought we were gonna ask Rainbow Dash.

37
00:02:50,750 --> 00:02:52,516
We need all the help we can get.

38
00:02:53,287 --> 00:02:54,180
Fine.

39
00:02:55,472 --> 00:02:56,515
Why, shoot.

40
00:02:56,732 --> 00:02:58,373
I was just a little filly.

41
00:02:58,414 --> 00:03:00,167
Even littler than y'all.

42
00:03:01,112 --> 00:03:03,660
I didn't want to spend my life
at a muddy old apple farm.

43
00:03:05,006 --> 00:03:07,013
I wanted to live the sophisticated life.

44
00:03:07,063 --> 00:03:08,792
Like my Aunt n' Uncle Orange.

45
00:03:13,945 --> 00:03:16,581
So I set out to try my luck in a big city.

46
00:03:16,683 --> 00:03:17,937
Manehattan!

47
00:03:18,258 --> 00:03:21,035
The most cosmopolitan city in all of Equestria.

48
00:03:21,620 --> 00:03:23,585
Ey! Outta the way, you ???!

49
00:03:23,988 --> 00:03:27,418
I knew I'd find out who I was
meant to be in Manehattan.

50
00:03:33,628 --> 00:03:35,631
Aunt Orange! Uncle Orange!

51
00:03:35,632 --> 00:03:38,145
Thank y'all so much for lettin' me stay!

52
00:03:38,496 --> 00:03:41,998
"Y'all". Ahahaha...
Isn't she just the living end?

53
00:03:42,067 --> 00:03:43,528
How quaint.

54
00:03:43,757 --> 00:03:47,908
Don't worry. We'll have you acting
like a true Manehattanite in no time.

55
00:03:53,316 --> 00:03:56,255
And how are you finding good old Manehattan?

56
00:03:56,427 --> 00:03:58,335
Oh, it's simply divine.

57
00:03:58,760 --> 00:04:00,398
Very well said, my dear.

58
00:04:00,909 --> 00:04:04,251
Although, I must admit the city noise
took some getting used to.

59
00:04:04,378 --> 00:04:06,753
Where I'm from, nights are so quiet...

60
00:04:06,754 --> 00:04:09,466
...you seldom hear a peep
until the roosters wake you.

61
00:04:09,474 --> 00:04:10,761
The... what?

62
00:04:10,961 --> 00:04:14,482
I say, my dear(?),
what in the world is a "rooster"?

63
00:04:14,668 --> 00:04:16,003
What's he talking about?

64
00:04:16,197 --> 00:04:17,259
What do I say?

65
00:04:17,359 --> 00:04:19,005
I don't wanna look like a fool.

66
00:04:19,540 --> 00:04:21,176
Dinner is served.

67
00:04:24,436 --> 00:04:27,963
Thank goodness. Being a city pony's hard work.

68
00:04:27,964 --> 00:04:29,595
I'm so hungry I could eat a...

69
00:04:39,398 --> 00:04:41,662
Cock-a-doodle-doo...

70
00:04:41,663 --> 00:04:45,136
Oh, I wonder what Granny Smith
and Big Macintosh are up to.

71
00:04:45,744 --> 00:04:49,277
I bet they're applebuckin' their way
through the Red Delicious trees.

72
00:04:49,772 --> 00:04:52,620
Oh, what I wouldn't give for just one bite...

73
00:04:52,775 --> 00:04:56,143
I never felt so homesick in all my days
as I did right then.

74
00:04:59,536 --> 00:05:00,657
It was amazin'!

75
00:05:00,658 --> 00:05:04,020
A rainbow pointin' right back to... home.

76
00:05:04,220 --> 00:05:06,737
In that moment, it all became clear.

77
00:05:06,942 --> 00:05:09,492
I knew right then just who I was supposed to be.

78
00:05:16,257 --> 00:05:17,823
That's when this here appeared.

79
00:05:18,291 --> 00:05:20,573
I've been happily workin' in the farm ever since.

80
00:05:23,548 --> 00:05:26,796
There they are!
Get back here, ya thievin' vermins!

81
00:05:28,008 --> 00:05:29,779
That was such a sweet story!

82
00:05:30,242 --> 00:05:32,177
Sweet? Try sappy.

83
00:05:33,525 --> 00:05:37,396
Come on! We've got to find Rainbow Dash
and hear the cool way to get a cutie mark.

84
00:05:47,381 --> 00:05:50,470
All right, little ones. This way. This way.

85
00:05:52,281 --> 00:05:54,175
You really should be more careful.

86
00:05:54,176 --> 00:05:55,746
Somepony could get hurt.

87
00:05:55,846 --> 00:05:57,837
Why you in such a hurry anyway?

88
00:05:58,102 --> 00:06:01,434
We're trying to find Rainbow Dash, so we
can hear how she earned her cutie mark.

89
00:06:01,561 --> 00:06:03,624
Oh, that would be interesting.

90
00:06:03,625 --> 00:06:07,017
You know, I wouldn't have gotten
my cutie mark if it weren't for her.

91
00:06:07,253 --> 00:06:09,392
Rainbow Dash?! Really?!

92
00:06:09,393 --> 00:06:13,168
Oh yes. It all started at Summer Flight Camp.

93
00:06:13,528 --> 00:06:17,775
You'd never guess, but when
I was little I was very shy.

94
00:06:18,017 --> 00:06:20,088
And a very weak flyer.

95
00:06:39,496 --> 00:06:41,720
Nice going, "Cluttershy"!

96
00:06:41,721 --> 00:06:43,686
They'll ground you permanently.

97
00:06:43,930 --> 00:06:46,745
HA! My baby brother can fly better than you!

98
00:06:46,746 --> 00:06:50,198
It was the most humiliating moment of my life.

99
00:06:50,199 --> 00:06:51,725
And then, out of nowhere...

100
00:06:56,934 --> 00:06:58,230
Leave her alone!

101
00:06:58,231 --> 00:07:01,438
Ooh, what are you gonna do, "Rainbow Crash"?

102
00:07:02,007 --> 00:07:04,094
Keep making fun of her and we'll find out!

103
00:07:04,262 --> 00:07:07,242
You think you're such a big shot?
Why don't you prove it?

104
00:07:07,442 --> 00:07:09,066
Whaddya have in mind?

105
00:07:12,935 --> 00:07:16,162
-You're going down!
-In history, maybe.

106
00:07:16,163 --> 00:07:18,330
See you boys at the finish line!

107
00:07:43,043 --> 00:07:46,263
I've never seen such beautiful creatures.

108
00:07:46,433 --> 00:07:48,957
Butterflies don't fly as high as my cloud home.

109
00:07:48,958 --> 00:07:51,142
And I've never been near the ground before.

110
00:07:53,557 --> 00:07:58,162
<i>What is this place
Filled with so many wonders</i>

111
00:07:58,163 --> 00:08:02,697
<i>Casting its spell
That I am now under</i>

112
00:08:02,698 --> 00:08:07,223
<i>Squirrels in the trees
And the cute little bunnies</i>

113
00:08:07,224 --> 00:08:12,190
<i>Birds flying free
And bees with their honey</i>

114
00:08:12,191 --> 00:08:17,300
<i>Honeeey!</i>

115
00:08:18,176 --> 00:08:23,954
<i>Oh, what a magical place
And I owe it all to the pegasus race</i>

116
00:08:23,955 --> 00:08:30,110
<i>If I knew the ground had so much up its sleeve
I'd have come here sooner and never leave!</i>

117
00:08:30,111 --> 00:08:33,111
<i>Yes, I love everything!</i>

118
00:08:53,230 --> 00:08:54,522
Shhh...

119
00:08:54,752 --> 00:08:55,875
It's okay.

120
00:08:59,788 --> 00:09:01,294
You can come out.

121
00:09:05,159 --> 00:09:06,950
Everything's okay.

122
00:09:07,542 --> 00:09:09,696
There's nothing to be afraid of.

123
00:09:13,809 --> 00:09:18,470
Somehow I had the ability to communicate
with the animals on a different level.

124
00:09:20,844 --> 00:09:23,006
Wait, wait, wait. What happened to Rainbow Dash?

125
00:09:23,007 --> 00:09:24,441
What about the race?

126
00:09:24,442 --> 00:09:28,139
Oh. Well, I wasn't there so
I don't really know what happened.

127
00:09:28,276 --> 00:09:30,625
Come one, Crusaders. We've gotta find her.

128
00:09:30,626 --> 00:09:33,383
Besides, I can't take any more singing.

129
00:09:33,384 --> 00:09:35,507
Maybe my sister knows where she is?

130
00:09:36,464 --> 00:09:37,677
Bye, Fluttershy!

131
00:09:37,850 --> 00:09:39,043
Bye, girls!

132
00:09:43,263 --> 00:09:45,379
How do we get roped into this?

133
00:09:45,380 --> 00:09:48,948
Oh, we'll never hear Rainbow Dash's story.

134
00:09:49,117 --> 00:09:52,131
Are you girls still obsessing
over your cutie marks?

135
00:09:52,132 --> 00:09:56,308
Of course! Most other fillies
at school already have theirs.

136
00:09:56,567 --> 00:09:58,316
Mmm, I know how you feel.

137
00:09:58,317 --> 00:10:01,827
For the longest time I couldn't
figure out why I didn't have mine.

138
00:10:10,139 --> 00:10:13,331
Well done, Rarity. Your costumes are very nice.

139
00:10:13,484 --> 00:10:16,595
Nice? They need to be spectacular!

140
00:10:16,596 --> 00:10:18,803
And the performance is tomorrow!

141
00:10:20,219 --> 00:10:24,044
I tried every trick I could think of,
but nothing seemed to work.

142
00:10:24,045 --> 00:10:25,696
The costumes just weren't right.

143
00:10:25,697 --> 00:10:27,950
And the play opened that night!

144
00:10:27,951 --> 00:10:31,341
Maybe I'm not meant to be
a fashionista after all.

145
00:10:34,949 --> 00:10:36,121
What's going on?!

146
00:10:38,050 --> 00:10:40,723
I had no idea where my horn was taking me.

147
00:10:40,724 --> 00:10:43,422
But unicorn magic doesn't
happen without a reason.

148
00:10:43,590 --> 00:10:45,970
I knew this had to do with my love of fashion...

149
00:10:45,971 --> 00:10:47,887
...and maybe even my cutie mark!

150
00:10:48,757 --> 00:10:50,468
I knew that this was...

151
00:10:50,676 --> 00:10:52,476
MY DESTINY!

152
00:10:55,036 --> 00:10:56,344
A ROCK?!

153
00:10:56,345 --> 00:10:58,096
That's my destiny?!

154
00:10:58,097 --> 00:10:59,693
What is your problem, horn?

155
00:10:59,793 --> 00:11:02,684
I followed you all the way out here for a rock?!

156
00:11:03,883 --> 00:11:05,130
Dumb rock!

157
00:11:33,730 --> 00:11:34,427
Ugh!

158
00:11:34,428 --> 00:11:38,262
These namby-pamby stories aren't getting us
any closer to our cutie marks!

159
00:11:38,263 --> 00:11:42,214
They're all about finding who you really are
and boring stuff like that.

160
00:11:42,215 --> 00:11:44,187
Yes, Scootaloo, that's exactly...

161
00:11:44,188 --> 00:11:48,310
Come on, girls! We need action!
We need Rainbow Dash!

162
00:11:49,081 --> 00:11:53,617
As a young filly in Canterlot, I always
wanted to go to the Summer Sun Celebration...

163
00:11:53,618 --> 00:11:55,918
...where Princess Celestia raises the sun.

164
00:11:55,919 --> 00:11:59,631
And I saw the most amazing,
most wonderful thing I've ever seen.

165
00:12:28,754 --> 00:12:31,871
I poured myself into learning
everything I could about magic.

166
00:12:46,667 --> 00:12:51,280
My parents decided to enroll me in
Princess Celestia's School for Gifted Unicorns.

167
00:12:51,974 --> 00:12:53,566
It was a dream come true!

168
00:12:53,905 --> 00:12:55,703
Except for one thing...

169
00:12:55,704 --> 00:12:58,152
I had to pass an entrance exam!

170
00:13:08,706 --> 00:13:10,218
Well, Miss Sparkle?

171
00:13:21,183 --> 00:13:22,502
Well, Miss Sparkle?

172
00:13:38,450 --> 00:13:39,948
We don't have all day.

173
00:13:40,216 --> 00:13:42,649
I knew this was the most
important day of my life...

174
00:13:42,650 --> 00:13:46,716
...that my entire future would be affected
by the outcome of this day...

175
00:13:47,668 --> 00:13:49,593
...and I was about to blow it!

176
00:13:54,006 --> 00:13:56,307
I'm sorry I wasted your time.

177
00:14:39,121 --> 00:14:40,589
Twilight Sparkle.

178
00:14:40,738 --> 00:14:42,252
Oh, I'm so sorry. I didn't mean...

179
00:14:42,253 --> 00:14:44,264
You have a very special gift.

180
00:14:44,265 --> 00:14:48,036
I don't think I've ever come across
a unicorn with your raw abilities.

181
00:14:48,037 --> 00:14:48,957
Huh?

182
00:14:48,958 --> 00:14:51,613
But you need to learn to tame
these abilities through focus study.

183
00:14:52,022 --> 00:14:52,659
Huh?!

184
00:14:53,059 --> 00:14:57,317
Twilight Sparkle, I'd like to make you
my own personal protege here at the school.

185
00:14:57,736 --> 00:14:58,587
HUH?!

186
00:14:59,235 --> 00:15:00,061
Well?

187
00:15:02,013 --> 00:15:03,287
YES!!!

188
00:15:03,288 --> 00:15:04,848
One other thing, Twilight.

189
00:15:05,116 --> 00:15:06,115
More?

190
00:15:10,523 --> 00:15:11,691
My cutie mark!

191
00:15:11,791 --> 00:15:15,824
Yesyesyesyesyesyesyesyesyes
yesyesyesyesyesyesyesyes...

192
00:15:15,825 --> 00:15:18,685
-Okay, okay.
-We're happy for you, Twilight.

193
00:15:19,241 --> 00:15:22,192
Yeah, thrilled. Let's get out of here
while we still can.

194
00:15:22,578 --> 00:15:24,985
...yesyes, YEEEES!

195
00:15:30,116 --> 00:15:31,533
Are you okay?

196
00:15:32,846 --> 00:15:35,079
Um... yes.

197
00:15:39,169 --> 00:15:42,763
Aaargh, why don't ever smash into Rainbow Dash?!

198
00:15:42,796 --> 00:15:44,259
You're looking for Rainbow Dash?

199
00:15:45,205 --> 00:15:47,499
If I was her, I'd be at Sugarcube Corner.

200
00:15:47,500 --> 00:15:49,958
Of course, if I was anyone,
I'd be at Sugarcube Corner.

201
00:15:50,276 --> 00:15:52,040
Hey! I have an idea!

202
00:15:52,041 --> 00:15:53,498
Wanna go to Sugarcube Corner?

203
00:15:54,885 --> 00:15:58,984
Well, we're sort of looking for Rainbow Dash,
so we can hear how she got her cutie mark.

204
00:15:58,985 --> 00:16:01,598
Cutie mark? Come with me
and I'll tell you how I got mine!

205
00:16:03,366 --> 00:16:04,512
Why not?

206
00:16:04,727 --> 00:16:06,236
Awright!

207
00:16:06,342 --> 00:16:09,686
My sisters and I were raised
on a rock farm outside of Ponyville.

208
00:16:09,721 --> 00:16:11,942
We spent our days working the fields.

209
00:16:11,943 --> 00:16:14,271
There was no talking. There was no smiling.

210
00:16:15,529 --> 00:16:17,345
There were only rocks.

211
00:16:19,802 --> 00:16:23,025
We were in the south field, preparing to
rotate rocks to the east field.

212
00:16:23,175 --> 00:16:24,480
Then all of a sudden...

213
00:16:34,639 --> 00:16:37,146
I've never felt joy like that before.

214
00:16:37,147 --> 00:16:40,887
It felt so good I just
wanted to keep smiling forever.

215
00:16:40,888 --> 00:16:43,100
And I wanted everyone I knew to smile too...

216
00:16:43,101 --> 00:16:45,214
...but rainbows don't come along that often.

217
00:16:45,614 --> 00:16:48,452
I wondered, how else could I create some smiles?

218
00:16:54,013 --> 00:16:57,089
We better harvest the rocks from the south field.

219
00:16:59,385 --> 00:17:01,565
Pinkamena Diane Pie! Is that you?

220
00:17:02,043 --> 00:17:05,380
Mom! I need you and dad
and the sisters to come in. Quick!

221
00:17:13,811 --> 00:17:14,911
Surprise!

222
00:17:14,912 --> 00:17:16,314
You like it? It's called...

223
00:17:16,315 --> 00:17:17,677
...a party!

224
00:17:29,013 --> 00:17:31,043
Oh. You don't like it.

225
00:17:37,335 --> 00:17:38,536
You like it!

226
00:17:38,842 --> 00:17:40,738
I'm so happy!

227
00:17:44,062 --> 00:17:46,778
And that's how Equestria was made.

228
00:17:47,862 --> 00:17:48,744
Wha... huh?

229
00:17:48,745 --> 00:17:50,138
Look! We're here!

230
00:17:50,438 --> 00:17:53,491
Maybe on the way home I can tell you
the story of how I got my cutie mark.

231
00:17:53,492 --> 00:17:54,612
It's a gem!

232
00:17:56,189 --> 00:17:59,216
Oh, come on. She's just being Pinkie Pie.

233
00:18:04,476 --> 00:18:06,340
Rainbow Dash! You're here!

234
00:18:07,057 --> 00:18:10,008
I hear *you're* looking for my cutie mark story.

235
00:18:10,914 --> 00:18:15,342
You have no idea what I've been through
today to hear that story.

236
00:18:16,836 --> 00:18:19,089
It all happened during the race at Flight Camp...

237
00:18:19,189 --> 00:18:23,684
...where I stood alone against all odds
to defend Fluttershy's honor.

238
00:18:48,685 --> 00:18:50,658
I've never flown like THAT before.

239
00:18:50,858 --> 00:18:53,927
That freedom was unlike anything I've ever felt.

240
00:18:53,928 --> 00:18:56,781
The speed, the adrenaline, the wind in my mane...

241
00:18:56,826 --> 00:18:58,208
I liked it!

242
00:18:58,625 --> 00:19:00,383
A lot.

243
00:19:02,673 --> 00:19:04,813
Later, "Rainbow Crash"!

244
00:19:05,848 --> 00:19:06,801
Hey!

245
00:19:07,264 --> 00:19:10,425
Turns out the only thing
I liked more than flying fast...

246
00:19:11,997 --> 00:19:13,413
...was winning!

247
00:19:19,923 --> 00:19:23,289
Most people thought that the sonic rainboom
was just an old mare's tale.

248
00:19:23,489 --> 00:19:26,343
But that day... The day I discovered racing...

249
00:19:26,344 --> 00:19:28,834
...I proved that the legends were true.

250
00:19:29,155 --> 00:19:31,803
I made the impossible happen!

251
00:19:43,001 --> 00:19:46,945
That that, little ones,
is how you earn a cutie mark.

252
00:19:46,946 --> 00:19:48,683
Wooooow...

253
00:19:48,684 --> 00:19:49,843
Wait a second.

254
00:19:50,348 --> 00:19:53,456
I heard that explosion.
And I saw the rainbow too.

255
00:19:53,537 --> 00:19:55,753
Rainbow Dash, if you hadn't scared the animals...

256
00:19:55,754 --> 00:19:59,010
...I never would have learned I could
communicate with them and gotten my cutie mark.

257
00:19:59,011 --> 00:20:02,972
I heard that boom! And right afterwards there was
amazing rainbow that taught me to smile.

258
00:20:03,059 --> 00:20:04,413
When I got my cutie mark...

259
00:20:04,513 --> 00:20:06,909
...I saw a rainbow that pointed me home.

260
00:20:07,409 --> 00:20:09,729
I bet it was your sonic rainboom!

261
00:20:09,730 --> 00:20:13,345
There an explosion I could never explain,
when I got my cutie mark.

262
00:20:13,445 --> 00:20:14,900
This is uncanny!

263
00:20:15,000 --> 00:20:17,246
If that explosion didn't happen when it did...

264
00:20:17,247 --> 00:20:19,060
...I would have blown my entrance exam.

265
00:20:19,061 --> 00:20:22,769
Rainbow Dash, I think you helped me
earn my cutie mark too!

266
00:20:24,461 --> 00:20:27,133
We all owe our cutie marks to you!

267
00:20:27,253 --> 00:20:29,389
Do you realize what this means?

268
00:20:29,469 --> 00:20:32,519
All of us had a special connection
before we even met.

269
00:20:32,520 --> 00:20:36,319
We've been BFFs forever
and we didn't even know it!

270
00:20:36,419 --> 00:20:37,798
Come here, y'all.

271
00:20:45,269 --> 00:20:46,483
Gimme a break.

272
00:20:46,484 --> 00:20:49,884
Come on, Crusaders!
Maybe we just need to try zip lining again.

273
00:20:52,689 --> 00:20:54,857
Hey. How about a song?

274
00:20:57,008 --> 00:21:00,437
NOOOOO!

275
00:21:00,907 --> 00:21:02,666
"Dear Princess Celestia."

276
00:21:02,667 --> 00:21:04,574
"Today I learned something amazing."

277
00:21:04,575 --> 00:21:08,671
"Everypony everywhere has a special
magical connection with her friends..."

278
00:21:08,672 --> 00:21:10,711
"...maybe even before she's met them."

279
00:21:10,712 --> 00:21:14,204
"If you're feeling lonely and you're
still searching for your true friends..."

280
00:21:14,205 --> 00:21:15,983
"...just look up in the sky."

281
00:21:15,984 --> 00:21:21,275
"Who knows? Maybe you and your future
best friends are all looking at the same rainbow."

282
00:21:22,238 --> 00:21:23,330
Gross!

283
00:21:23,530 --> 00:21:25,317
When did you get so cheesy?

284
00:21:25,599 --> 00:21:27,135
Just write it, Spike.

285
00:21:30,032 --> 00:21:33,532
