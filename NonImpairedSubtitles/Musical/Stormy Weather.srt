1
00:01:08,735 --> 00:01:14,197
Oh, the rang, tang, tang.

2
00:01:14,274 --> 00:01:16,265
Yeah, the rang, tang, tang.

3
00:01:16,342 --> 00:01:20,005
Oh, the rang, tang, tang.
Oh, the rang, tang, tang.

4
00:01:36,996 --> 00:01:39,191
Uncle Bill!

5
00:01:39,265 --> 00:01:41,733
<i>Uncle Bill! Uncle Bill!</i>

6
00:01:41,801 --> 00:01:44,031
- Here's your picture.
- That's it, Uncle Bill.

7
00:01:44,104 --> 00:01:46,732
- Well, what do you know?
- Read us about it, Uncle Bill.

8
00:01:46,806 --> 00:01:49,434
- Well, look at this.
- Read it, Uncle Bill.

9
00:01:49,509 --> 00:01:53,138
What does it say, Uncle Bill?

10
00:01:53,213 --> 00:01:55,272
Why, it say, " Dear Bill:

11
00:01:55,348 --> 00:01:57,873
Jim Europe would have been
proud of you."

12
00:01:57,951 --> 00:02:00,715
Signed, " Ex-Drum Major,
Noble Sissle."

13
00:02:00,787 --> 00:02:02,778
Who's Jim Europe, Uncle Bill?

14
00:02:02,856 --> 00:02:05,723
Jim Europe? Why he had
the greatest band in the world-

15
00:02:05,792 --> 00:02:07,987
Attached to the 15th Regiment.
Didn't I never tell you that?

16
00:02:08,061 --> 00:02:10,086
No, Uncle Bill!

17
00:02:10,163 --> 00:02:12,996
Why, we was under fire
for 191 days straight.

18
00:02:13,066 --> 00:02:16,763
Yes, sir! And our regiment was decorated
with the Croix de Guerre.

19
00:02:16,836 --> 00:02:18,827
You don't say, Uncle Bill.

20
00:02:18,905 --> 00:02:22,602
Why, children, I remember when
we come back from France in 1918...

21
00:02:22,675 --> 00:02:26,475
the flags was flying,
people were cheering.

22
00:02:55,608 --> 00:02:58,304
- Boy, I'm looking out for us.
- What you got there?

23
00:02:58,378 --> 00:03:00,778
Book of telephone numbers
I won from Joe.

24
00:03:00,847 --> 00:03:03,645
Boy, I'm gonna promote us
a couple of gals...

25
00:03:03,716 --> 00:03:05,980
<i>- for the ball tonight.
- How do you spell "us"?</i>

26
00:03:06,052 --> 00:03:09,647
<i>- "U.S."
- You leave off the "S" and worry about you.</i>

27
00:03:09,722 --> 00:03:12,316
Every time you start to promoting,
that spells trouble.

28
00:03:12,392 --> 00:03:16,192
<i>Here we go again.</i>

29
00:03:16,262 --> 00:03:19,322
- Did you go to the ball that night?
- We sure did.

30
00:03:19,399 --> 00:03:22,664
- And did Gabe promote you a girl, Uncle Bill?
- No, he didn't...

31
00:03:22,735 --> 00:03:24,726
but he promoted everything else-

32
00:03:24,804 --> 00:03:28,171
a girl for himself,
a big limousine and a chauffeur.

33
00:03:28,241 --> 00:03:30,334
We sure went there in style.

34
00:03:30,410 --> 00:03:31,509
<i>This must be General Pershing coming.</i>

35
00:03:31,544 --> 00:03:34,342
<i>This must be General Pershing coming.</i>

36
00:03:34,414 --> 00:03:38,043
Can't be, because
General Pershing's a blond.

37
00:03:38,117 --> 00:03:41,416
Well, boy, here we are,
and I'm gonna Lindy Hop down.

38
00:03:41,487 --> 00:03:45,321
Boy, I'm gonna carry on. Come on, honey.

39
00:03:45,391 --> 00:03:47,484
Come back at 12:00, my man.

40
00:03:47,560 --> 00:03:50,051
Come on, honey.

41
00:03:50,129 --> 00:03:52,222
Yes, you.

42
00:03:52,298 --> 00:03:54,391
Cousin Jake,
what you want this time?

43
00:03:54,467 --> 00:03:56,560
What you keep on calling me for?

44
00:03:56,636 --> 00:03:58,729
I'm sorry, Gabe.
I can't come back and get you.

45
00:03:58,805 --> 00:04:01,433
- Why?
- The boss wants to use the car at 7:00.

46
00:04:01,507 --> 00:04:03,532
But, Cousin Jake,
how we gonna get home?

47
00:04:03,610 --> 00:04:05,840
How'd you get uptown
from the ship this morning?

48
00:04:05,912 --> 00:04:08,813
- Walked.
- Right there's your answer.

49
00:04:16,956 --> 00:04:19,390
- I'm going to the powder room.
- All right.

50
00:04:19,459 --> 00:04:22,724
- Daddy, can I have a dollar for the maid?
- Huh? Oh, sure.

51
00:04:22,795 --> 00:04:25,025
Sure, sure, honey.
Here you are. Here you are.

52
00:04:25,098 --> 00:04:28,625
Right here.
Go ahead.

53
00:04:28,701 --> 00:04:31,135
Man, you gonna brag yourself
into the poor house yet.

54
00:04:31,204 --> 00:04:33,229
Well, I ain't got far to go.

55
00:04:33,306 --> 00:04:36,275
That just leaves $4.30
twixt me and it.

56
00:04:56,429 --> 00:04:59,227
I should have called one of them
numbers in Joe's book for you.

57
00:04:59,299 --> 00:05:02,564
You see, the trouble with you is-
What I mean is-

58
00:05:02,635 --> 00:05:07,231
when it comes to women,
you just don't know, or else-

59
00:05:07,307 --> 00:05:09,400
Man, you're ramblin'.
What hit you?

60
00:05:09,475 --> 00:05:12,137
Look at that gal
standing over there.

61
00:05:12,211 --> 00:05:14,736
There's nothing like that
in that book you was talking about.

62
00:05:17,050 --> 00:05:19,450
Better not be.

63
00:05:31,364 --> 00:05:33,628
Lieutenant Europe?

64
00:05:33,700 --> 00:05:35,725
Well, well. Selina Rogers.

65
00:05:35,802 --> 00:05:37,793
Hello, Jim.
It's nice to see you back.

66
00:05:37,870 --> 00:05:40,703
I'm mighty happy to see you, honey.
And how you've grown up.

67
00:05:40,773 --> 00:05:43,640
Say, Jim, I'm looking for Clem's buddy,
Bill Williamson.

68
00:05:43,710 --> 00:05:46,144
- Can you point him out to me?
- I'm sure I can.

69
00:05:46,212 --> 00:05:49,272
He's bound to be around here somewhere.
Come on. We'll find him.

70
00:05:49,349 --> 00:05:51,340
- Okay.
- I hear that you're a big star now.

71
00:05:51,417 --> 00:05:53,442
Yes, I'm doing nicely, thank you.

72
00:05:53,519 --> 00:05:55,510
I used to tell you you'd
get there someday. Remember?

73
00:05:55,588 --> 00:05:58,648
You taught me my first song.
I'm still singing it too.

74
00:05:58,725 --> 00:06:01,660
There's Bill Williamson now.
Private Williamson!

75
00:06:01,728 --> 00:06:03,855
<i>- Attention!
- Who, me?</i>

76
00:06:03,930 --> 00:06:07,832
My ears hear something,
but my feet don't believe it.

77
00:06:07,900 --> 00:06:10,027
Bill, this is Selina Rogers...

78
00:06:10,103 --> 00:06:12,128
<i>- Clem's little sister.
- Who's sister?</i>

79
00:06:12,205 --> 00:06:14,298
<i>- Clem's.
- You don't mean Clem Rogers?</i>

80
00:06:14,374 --> 00:06:16,365
<i>- Yes.
- My!</i>

81
00:06:16,442 --> 00:06:20,879
<i>- I didn't expect Clem's
little sister to be so big.</i>

82
00:06:20,947 --> 00:06:22,972
You two get together.
I've got to get on back to work.

83
00:06:23,049 --> 00:06:25,540
- Okay, Jim.
- I'll see you kids later.

84
00:06:25,618 --> 00:06:29,520
I'm glad to meet you, Bill.
Clem wrote me a lot about you.

85
00:06:29,589 --> 00:06:31,819
He told me a lot about you too.

86
00:06:31,891 --> 00:06:33,882
You know,
I was gonna look you up.

87
00:06:33,960 --> 00:06:37,225
Here's something
that he wanted you to have.

88
00:06:37,296 --> 00:06:41,062
It's the Croix de Guerre for bravery.

89
00:06:41,134 --> 00:06:43,227
Here I am, Daddy.

90
00:06:43,302 --> 00:06:45,327
My, what a big cigar.

91
00:06:45,405 --> 00:06:48,465
Yes, and a big man
is smoking it too, honey.

92
00:06:50,476 --> 00:06:52,569
Honey, I does everything
in a big way.

93
00:06:52,645 --> 00:06:54,738
It must have cost you
a lot of money to keep...

94
00:06:54,814 --> 00:06:56,839
that car and chauffeur
while you were at war.

95
00:06:56,916 --> 00:06:58,907
Chicken feed, honey,
just chicken feed.

96
00:06:58,985 --> 00:07:03,081
- You must be powerful rich.
- Oh, I got a little. I got a little.

97
00:07:03,156 --> 00:07:06,592
- Gardenias. Twenty-five cents.
- Yes, indeed.

98
00:07:06,659 --> 00:07:08,684
Nothing too good for the little lady.

99
00:07:08,761 --> 00:07:11,855
Yes. My daddy does
everything in a big way.

100
00:07:11,931 --> 00:07:13,922
- Give me all of them.
- All of them?

101
00:07:14,000 --> 00:07:16,366
I sure go for a guy
that's free with his money.

102
00:07:16,436 --> 00:07:18,734
Do you, honey?

103
00:07:18,805 --> 00:07:20,898
- That'll be $3.00.
- Huh?

104
00:07:20,973 --> 00:07:24,136
It was very nice of you
to tell me all this about Clem.

105
00:07:24,210 --> 00:07:26,440
Oh, that's all right.

106
00:07:26,512 --> 00:07:29,709
- You want to dance, Selina?
- I'd love to, soldier.

107
00:07:31,651 --> 00:07:34,984
Ooh, I never expected to have
so many flowers till I was dead.

108
00:07:35,054 --> 00:07:37,079
Let's dance, Daddy.

109
00:07:37,156 --> 00:07:39,989
No, come on, let's sit down.
Waiter, table for two.

110
00:07:40,059 --> 00:07:42,084
I've been marching all day.

111
00:07:42,161 --> 00:07:44,391
Anyway, there ain't
no point in dancing.

112
00:07:44,464 --> 00:07:46,455
- What are you gonna drink?
- What you got?

113
00:07:46,532 --> 00:07:48,557
- Just ginger ale and root beer.
- What?

114
00:07:48,634 --> 00:07:51,262
You positive you ain't got nothing
but ginger ale and root beer?

115
00:07:51,337 --> 00:07:53,771
- That's all we got.
- This is gonna spoil my whole evening...

116
00:07:53,840 --> 00:07:56,274
'cause back in Paris, I didn't
drink nothin' but champagne-

117
00:07:56,342 --> 00:07:58,333
the best of champagne.

118
00:07:58,411 --> 00:08:01,278
Well, now, maybe I'd be able
to fix you up with a bottle of that.

119
00:08:01,347 --> 00:08:03,338
I got a friend on the outside.

120
00:08:03,416 --> 00:08:05,441
- But it'll cost you plenty of money.
- Oh, that's all right.

121
00:08:05,518 --> 00:08:09,614
- Money's no object to us. Is it, Daddy?
- Well, no.

122
00:08:09,689 --> 00:08:12,954
- I'll see what I can do.
- Uh, yeah, here, boy. Come here. Come here.

123
00:08:13,025 --> 00:08:16,290
- Don't knock yourself out. It ain't that important.
- Oh, he don't mind.

124
00:08:16,362 --> 00:08:18,353
I always wanted to taste that stuff.

125
00:08:18,431 --> 00:08:20,661
Well, honey, if you never tasted it,
it might make you dizzy.

126
00:08:20,733 --> 00:08:22,758
- That's what it's for, ain't it?
- I'll do my best.

127
00:08:22,835 --> 00:08:24,826
But-

128
00:08:24,904 --> 00:08:27,099
I sure hope I'll be able to walk
out of here without any trouble.

129
00:08:27,173 --> 00:08:29,164
Me too.

130
00:09:09,115 --> 00:09:11,743
- Aw, that was swell.
- I want you to meet Gabe.

131
00:09:11,817 --> 00:09:15,082
- Who's Gabe?
- Why, he was Clem's other buddy.

132
00:09:15,154 --> 00:09:17,384
There he is, right there.
Come on over.

133
00:09:17,456 --> 00:09:20,721
You know, they called us
the Three Musketeers of the A.E.F.

134
00:09:20,793 --> 00:09:23,853
Meet Selina Rogers, Clem's sister.

135
00:09:23,930 --> 00:09:27,195
I'm mighty proud.
This is Miss Cynthenetta Webb.

136
00:09:27,266 --> 00:09:29,666
Say, this buddy of yours
is a sharp dancer.

137
00:09:29,735 --> 00:09:31,726
He ought to be on the stage.

138
00:09:31,804 --> 00:09:33,863
Ought to be on the stage?

139
00:09:33,940 --> 00:09:37,205
Oh, by the way, Bill. I had the booking
office on the phone this afternoon.

140
00:09:37,276 --> 00:09:39,904
Looks like you gonna play the Palace
week after next, boy.

141
00:09:39,979 --> 00:09:42,174
- Then you are on the stage.
- Why-

142
00:09:42,248 --> 00:09:45,411
Yes, and he's his manager.
He's gonna put me on the stage too.

143
00:09:45,484 --> 00:09:48,248
- Really?
- Well, I don't usually bother with amateurs...

144
00:09:48,321 --> 00:09:51,586
- but in this case-
- Oh, Gabe, why don't you come up for air?

145
00:09:51,657 --> 00:09:54,922
Now listen to him, the most
modest man in the whole world.

146
00:09:54,994 --> 00:09:58,259
Oh, let him go on, Bill.
I'd like to hear more about you.

147
00:09:58,331 --> 00:10:00,356
You only got to ask
anybody in show business.

148
00:10:00,433 --> 00:10:02,867
Take Bud Williams-
He's crazy about Bill and me.

149
00:10:02,935 --> 00:10:05,733
Oh! Then you must know
Chick Bailey.

150
00:10:05,805 --> 00:10:07,796
Chick Bailey!
Do we know Chick Bailey?

151
00:10:07,873 --> 00:10:09,898
Why, we put him in show business.

152
00:10:09,976 --> 00:10:12,001
We're just like brothers,
ain't we, Bill?

153
00:10:12,078 --> 00:10:15,741
Sure.

154
00:10:15,815 --> 00:10:17,908
Ladies and gentlemen.

155
00:10:17,984 --> 00:10:21,010
Presenting Miss Selina Rogers...

156
00:10:21,087 --> 00:10:23,954
one of our newest stars.

157
00:10:24,023 --> 00:10:28,050
- Well, here's where we break in the new song, Selina.
- Okay.

158
00:10:28,127 --> 00:10:30,118
Miss Webb, Bill Williamson...

159
00:10:30,196 --> 00:10:32,221
- this is my partner, Chick Bailey.
- How do you do?

160
00:10:32,298 --> 00:10:35,324
- You know Gabe, of course.
- Gabe?

161
00:10:35,401 --> 00:10:37,426
- Come on.
- Who'd she say?

162
00:10:37,503 --> 00:10:39,494
He heard her- Chick Bailey.

163
00:10:39,572 --> 00:10:41,836
The guy he put in show business-
his brother.

164
00:10:41,907 --> 00:10:44,205
- But, honey, I can explain everything.
- Don't explain nothing to me.

165
00:10:44,276 --> 00:10:46,267
- I can see through it. The nerve.
- But, baby-

166
00:10:46,345 --> 00:10:48,472
- Trying to pull a trick like that.
- Well, honey, I was only-

167
00:10:48,547 --> 00:10:50,572
And after all you've done for him.

168
00:10:50,650 --> 00:10:52,743
<i>Why, the ingratitude.</i>

169
00:10:52,818 --> 00:10:55,116
Trying to make out like
he didn't even recognize you.

170
00:10:55,187 --> 00:10:57,280
Hmph!

171
00:11:00,493 --> 00:11:03,758
<i>I may not be so very smart</i>

172
00:11:03,829 --> 00:11:07,094
<i>As far as books are concerned</i>

173
00:11:07,166 --> 00:11:12,035
<i>Where I leave off most people start</i>

174
00:11:12,104 --> 00:11:17,440
<i>But here's what I've just learned</i>

175
00:11:19,512 --> 00:11:25,348
<i>There's no two ways about love</i>

176
00:11:25,418 --> 00:11:30,981
<i>It's true what they say about love</i>

177
00:11:31,057 --> 00:11:35,460
<i>Come what may, it's just that way</i>

178
00:11:35,528 --> 00:11:40,261
<i>There's no two ways about love</i>

179
00:11:40,332 --> 00:11:45,702
<i>When fate appears on the scene</i>

180
00:11:45,771 --> 00:11:50,868
<i>There's no betwixt and between</i>

181
00:11:50,943 --> 00:11:56,176
<i>There's no doubt
You're in or out</i>

182
00:11:56,248 --> 00:12:00,241
<i>There's no two ways about love</i>

183
00:12:00,319 --> 00:12:04,016
<i>It comes right out of the blue</i>

184
00:12:04,090 --> 00:12:06,490
<i>Like a cyclone</i>

185
00:12:06,559 --> 00:12:11,929
<i>Sweeps you right off your feet</i>

186
00:12:11,997 --> 00:12:17,162
<i>Don't try to cut any corners</i>

187
00:12:17,236 --> 00:12:22,572
<i>You're heaven bound
on a one-way street</i>

188
00:12:22,641 --> 00:12:27,578
<i>The schemes that you're dreamin' of</i>

189
00:12:27,646 --> 00:12:33,016
<i>Fit into your world like a glove</i>

190
00:12:33,085 --> 00:12:38,022
<i>Once you're hooked
your goose is cooked</i>

191
00:12:38,090 --> 00:12:42,049
<i>There's no two ways about love</i>

192
00:12:42,128 --> 00:12:46,360
<i>It comes right out of the blue</i>

193
00:12:46,432 --> 00:12:49,265
<i>Like a cyclone</i>

194
00:12:49,335 --> 00:12:54,272
<i>Sweeps you right off your feet</i>

195
00:12:54,340 --> 00:12:59,243
<i>Don't try to cut any corners</i>

196
00:12:59,311 --> 00:13:05,307
<i>You're heaven bound
on a one-way street</i>

197
00:13:05,384 --> 00:13:10,117
<i>The schemes you're dreamin' of</i>

198
00:13:10,189 --> 00:13:15,559
<i>Fit into your world like a glove</i>

199
00:13:15,628 --> 00:13:20,565
<i>Once you're hooked
your goose is cooked</i>

200
00:13:20,633 --> 00:13:25,002
<i>There's no two ways about love</i>

201
00:13:26,672 --> 00:13:32,804
<i>There's no two ways about love</i>

202
00:13:34,380 --> 00:13:36,814
What's the matter, sister?
Don't you like music?

203
00:13:36,882 --> 00:13:39,112
Sure.
But I like this better.

204
00:13:39,185 --> 00:13:42,279
Hmph. Here comes
that Mr. Chick Bailey again.

205
00:13:42,354 --> 00:13:45,152
- Gee, Selina, you were swell.
- Thank you.

206
00:13:45,224 --> 00:13:48,284
Say, waiter.
Same thing all around.

207
00:13:48,360 --> 00:13:51,818
- And the party's on me, so see that I get the check.
- Oh, yes, sir.

208
00:13:51,897 --> 00:13:53,990
Oh, I wouldn't want you to do that.

209
00:13:54,066 --> 00:13:56,091
Oh, that's nothing.
It's a pleasure.

210
00:13:56,168 --> 00:13:58,500
Well, I wouldn't argue over trivialities.

211
00:13:58,571 --> 00:14:00,596
How long you gonna stay
in New York, Bill?

212
00:14:00,673 --> 00:14:03,233
- I gotta leave town tonight.
- That's an excellent idea.

213
00:14:03,309 --> 00:14:06,642
You see, I've got my old job
waiting for me down in Memphis.

214
00:14:06,712 --> 00:14:09,772
Oh, but with the talent you've got,
you should be a dancer.

215
00:14:09,849 --> 00:14:12,477
Oh, I only know a few steps
I picked up myself.

216
00:14:12,551 --> 00:14:15,782
Yes, but you could work at it and learn.
Couldn't he, Chick?

217
00:14:15,855 --> 00:14:16,879
Sure. They even teach elephants to dance.

218
00:14:18,791 --> 00:14:20,816
Ladies and gentlemen.

219
00:14:20,893 --> 00:14:24,795
<i>The Cake Walk.</i>

220
00:15:32,461 --> 00:15:34,929
Everybody join in!

221
00:15:34,997 --> 00:15:37,090
Come on, Selina.
Let's try and win this cake.

222
00:15:37,165 --> 00:15:40,532
- But this is our dance.
- Tonight's the army's night, Chick.

223
00:15:44,740 --> 00:15:47,436
Wait a minute, waiter.
Come on, let's dance, honey.

224
00:15:47,509 --> 00:15:50,808
- But you said there was no point in dancing.
- But there is now, baby.

225
00:15:50,879 --> 00:15:53,871
Why, you big blow-off.
Trying to show my daddy up!

226
00:15:53,949 --> 00:15:56,383
But you ain't foolin' nobody.
Hmph!

227
00:15:56,451 --> 00:15:59,648
- We got your number.
- Your check, sir.

228
00:16:19,541 --> 00:16:22,032
Clem never told me
you could sing like that, Selina.

229
00:16:22,110 --> 00:16:24,340
I couldn't when Clem went away...

230
00:16:24,413 --> 00:16:27,007
but I practiced, and I studied.

231
00:16:27,082 --> 00:16:29,141
I've always been ambitious.
Haven't you, Bill?

232
00:16:29,217 --> 00:16:33,210
Never have been, except to get
three square meals a day, regular.

233
00:16:33,288 --> 00:16:37,224
But I'm beginning
to see things different now.

234
00:16:55,177 --> 00:16:57,270
Sorry you're going away, Bill.

235
00:16:57,346 --> 00:16:59,371
- Oh, I'll be back.
- When?

236
00:16:59,448 --> 00:17:01,746
Oh, when I get to be somebody.

237
00:17:12,928 --> 00:17:15,226
Man, there ain't nobody
in the world...

238
00:17:15,297 --> 00:17:18,562
can get me on my feet again
until we hit Memphis-

239
00:17:18,633 --> 00:17:22,535
- unless this boat sinks.
- I'm tired too.

240
00:17:22,604 --> 00:17:25,869
And if I never see
a bale of cotton no more in life...

241
00:17:25,941 --> 00:17:28,432
that'll be too soon.

242
00:17:35,417 --> 00:17:38,978
<i>What's that?</i>

243
00:17:39,054 --> 00:17:42,751
Must be them traveling
minstrel boys got on in New Orleans.

244
00:17:42,824 --> 00:17:44,883
Hee, hee!

245
00:17:47,195 --> 00:17:49,629
<i>Oh, has you seen Miss Linda Brown</i>

246
00:17:49,698 --> 00:17:52,428
<i>She's the finest gal in town
Turns all Memphis upside down</i>

247
00:17:52,501 --> 00:17:54,628
<i>- Yeah, man, yeah, man
- She's a dark-eyed Dixie queen</i>

248
00:17:54,703 --> 00:17:56,728
<i>Boy, she got it and she got it mean</i>

249
00:17:56,805 --> 00:17:59,000
<i>- "Struttingest" gal I ever seen
- Yeah, man, yeah, man</i>

250
00:17:59,074 --> 00:18:01,508
<i>Now you should see her
when she gets goin'</i>

251
00:18:01,576 --> 00:18:04,943
<i>- Reminds you of the Mississippi flowin'
- Aw, you dog!</i>

252
00:18:05,013 --> 00:18:07,948
<i>- Think you boys is hot enough
- Yes, us boys is hot enough</i>

253
00:18:08,016 --> 00:18:11,008
<i>- Well, come on boys, let's play the stuff
- Yeah, man, yeah, man</i>

254
00:18:11,086 --> 00:18:13,179
<i>- I do a
- You can't do no</i>

255
00:18:13,255 --> 00:18:17,919
- Yes I can
- Yeah, man, yeah, man

256
00:18:37,879 --> 00:18:40,712
<i>- I can take a chorus too
- You can't take no chorus too</i>

257
00:18:40,782 --> 00:18:43,774
<i>- Yes I can take a chorus too
- Yeah, man, yeah, man</i>

258
00:19:05,607 --> 00:19:09,065
<i>- I can do some shufflin' too
- Look out man, what you gonna do?</i>

259
00:19:09,144 --> 00:19:13,240
<i>- Look out, boys, he's comin' through
- Yeah, man, yeah, man</i>

260
00:19:17,452 --> 00:19:19,511
<i>Boy, he got educated feet.</i>

261
00:19:19,588 --> 00:19:21,579
Boy, I practice all the time.

262
00:19:21,656 --> 00:19:24,022
Here's what I sit up
all night trying to do.

263
00:19:26,661 --> 00:19:28,754
Get this.

264
00:19:32,868 --> 00:19:37,703
When the boat docks in Memphis, you should
get yourself a job in one of them Beale St. cafés.

265
00:19:37,772 --> 00:19:39,763
Boy, you been readin' my mind.

266
00:19:39,841 --> 00:19:42,002
Watch me go to Beale St.

267
00:19:42,077 --> 00:19:44,238
Hee, hee!

268
00:19:56,925 --> 00:20:00,588
<i>Oh, sand, oh, sand</i>

269
00:20:00,662 --> 00:20:02,823
<i>Yeah, sand</i>

270
00:20:55,517 --> 00:20:57,508
Ada, the boys want another round.

271
00:20:57,586 --> 00:21:01,078
Give 'em the joint.
It's on its last leg anyway.

272
00:21:01,156 --> 00:21:03,215
Two up, boy.

273
00:21:06,361 --> 00:21:08,989
<i>Baby, baby</i>

274
00:21:09,064 --> 00:21:13,125
<i>What is the matter with you</i>

275
00:21:13,201 --> 00:21:16,898
Ain't nothin' wrong
with me, babes. Nothin' at all.

276
00:21:18,173 --> 00:21:21,301
<i>Baby, baby</i>

277
00:21:21,376 --> 00:21:25,938
<i>What is the matter with you</i>

278
00:21:26,014 --> 00:21:29,074
<i>One never knows, do one?</i>

279
00:21:29,150 --> 00:21:31,948
<i>You got the world in a jar</i>

280
00:21:32,020 --> 00:21:34,011
Yeah, but where's the stopper?

281
00:21:34,089 --> 00:21:36,956
<i>And you've got nothin' to do</i>

282
00:21:37,025 --> 00:21:42,156
Do you hear that mess?
She's always layin' it on me.

283
00:21:42,230 --> 00:21:45,393
<i>- You know I always told ya
- Mmm.</i>

284
00:21:45,467 --> 00:21:47,992
<i>- You'd be the death of me
- Mm.</i>

285
00:21:48,069 --> 00:21:50,902
<i>And when I'm always with you</i>

286
00:21:50,972 --> 00:21:53,634
<i>I get the third degree</i>

287
00:21:53,708 --> 00:21:58,202
<i>- That ain't right
- Aw, tell these fools anything, but tell me the truth.</i>

288
00:21:58,280 --> 00:22:01,477
<i>Oh, that ain't right at all</i>

289
00:22:01,549 --> 00:22:05,508
What's wrong with it?
What's wrong with it?

290
00:22:05,587 --> 00:22:09,683
<i>Yes, you're takin' all my money</i>

291
00:22:09,758 --> 00:22:13,216
<i>And goin' out havin' yourself a ball</i>

292
00:22:13,295 --> 00:22:17,288
Baby, I was born ballin',
and I'm gonna ball the rest of my life.

293
00:22:17,365 --> 00:22:21,165
<i>I took you to a nightclub</i>

294
00:22:21,236 --> 00:22:24,262
<i>- I bought you pink champagne
- That's right.</i>

295
00:22:24,339 --> 00:22:26,773
<i>You rode home in a taxi</i>

296
00:22:26,841 --> 00:22:29,537
<i>While I caught that subway train</i>

297
00:22:29,611 --> 00:22:31,602
Hey, hey!

298
00:22:31,680 --> 00:22:33,875
<i>- That ain't right
- Oh, that's all right, baby.</i>

299
00:22:33,948 --> 00:22:37,213
- That's just a slight-
- Oh, that ain't right at all

300
00:22:37,285 --> 00:22:39,981
Oh, that's all right, baby.
That's all right with me, in fact.

301
00:22:42,090 --> 00:22:46,186
<i>That you're takin' all my money</i>

302
00:22:46,261 --> 00:22:49,287
<i>And goin' out havin' yourself a ball</i>

303
00:22:49,364 --> 00:22:51,594
Aw, beef to me, mama, beef to me.

304
00:22:51,666 --> 00:22:54,430
I don't like pork no how.

305
00:22:54,502 --> 00:22:57,232
<i>- I went to a fortune-teller
- Yeah?</i>

306
00:22:57,305 --> 00:23:00,570
<i>- And had my fortune told
- What'd she say?</i>

307
00:23:00,642 --> 00:23:03,076
<i>She said you didn't love me</i>

308
00:23:03,144 --> 00:23:06,773
<i>- All you wanted was my gold
- She was right.</i>

309
00:23:06,848 --> 00:23:10,579
- How'd she know?
- That ain't right

310
00:23:10,652 --> 00:23:13,485
<i>Oh, oh, oh, ain't right at all</i>

311
00:23:13,555 --> 00:23:16,353
Everybody wants some gold, baby.

312
00:23:17,859 --> 00:23:22,455
<i>Yes, you're takin' all my money</i>

313
00:23:22,530 --> 00:23:27,058
<i>And goin' out havin' yourself a ball</i>

314
00:23:27,135 --> 00:23:29,399
Suffer, excess baggage, suffer.

315
00:23:29,471 --> 00:23:31,530
Yeah.

316
00:23:36,311 --> 00:23:39,576
- Just saw Chick Bailey.
- Chick Bailey from Chicago?

317
00:23:39,647 --> 00:23:41,638
Yes. Been playin' in New Orleans.

318
00:23:41,716 --> 00:23:43,741
Just stopped on his way through.

319
00:23:43,818 --> 00:23:45,809
Comin' down Beale St. with a big party.

320
00:23:45,887 --> 00:23:48,754
Says he wants to put Fats
for his new show at the Pickens Theater.

321
00:23:48,823 --> 00:23:52,691
Fats, you's now on your way
to fame and fortune.

322
00:23:52,761 --> 00:23:57,095
Boys, smarten up.
Let's put the best-lookin' one in front.

323
00:23:57,165 --> 00:23:59,156
- That's me.
- All right.

324
00:23:59,234 --> 00:24:01,327
So we can see the lighting effect
in the drum.

325
00:24:01,403 --> 00:24:03,769
Hey, Ada, do I look better
with the hat on or with it off?

326
00:24:03,838 --> 00:24:06,671
With or without, man,
you leave me cold.

327
00:24:06,741 --> 00:24:08,766
<i>- Bill!
- Yeah?</i>

328
00:24:08,843 --> 00:24:11,676
Those tables- push them together.
Here they come.

329
00:24:11,746 --> 00:24:14,476
I wish somebody would
book me someplace.

330
00:24:14,549 --> 00:24:16,642
- Hey, Chick Bailey.
- Hello, Ada.

331
00:24:19,487 --> 00:24:22,115
Nice table right here for you.

332
00:24:22,190 --> 00:24:25,455
Round of drinks,
and the best in the house.

333
00:24:25,527 --> 00:24:27,518
Well, Ada, let's
hear that band of yours.

334
00:24:27,595 --> 00:24:29,620
All right, Fats, go to work.

335
00:24:29,697 --> 00:24:32,461
Well, all right then, boys,
latch on! Come on.

336
00:24:42,410 --> 00:24:44,640
<i>No one to talk with</i>

337
00:24:44,712 --> 00:24:47,146
<i>All by myself</i>

338
00:24:47,215 --> 00:24:49,206
<i>No one to walk with</i>

339
00:24:49,284 --> 00:24:52,344
<i>But I might be on the shelf</i>

340
00:24:52,420 --> 00:24:55,048
<i>Ain't misbehavin'</i>

341
00:24:55,123 --> 00:24:57,751
<i>Savin' my love for you</i>

342
00:24:57,826 --> 00:25:02,388
<i>For you, for you, for you</i>

343
00:25:02,464 --> 00:25:04,864
<i>I know for certain</i>

344
00:25:04,933 --> 00:25:07,367
<i>The one I love</i>

345
00:25:07,435 --> 00:25:09,426
<i>I'm through with flirtin'</i>

346
00:25:09,504 --> 00:25:12,530
<i>It's you that I'm thinkin' of</i>

347
00:25:12,607 --> 00:25:15,075
<i>Ain't misbehavin'</i>

348
00:25:15,143 --> 00:25:19,603
<i>Savin' my love for you</i>

349
00:25:23,084 --> 00:25:27,817
<i>Like Jack Horner in the corner</i>

350
00:25:27,889 --> 00:25:33,225
<i>Don't go nowhere
What do I care</i>

351
00:25:33,294 --> 00:25:35,421
<i>Your kisses</i>

352
00:25:35,497 --> 00:25:39,228
<i>A re worth waiting for</i>

353
00:25:39,300 --> 00:25:41,768
<i>Believe me</i>

354
00:25:41,836 --> 00:25:44,896
<i>- I don't stay out late
- Well, uh-</i>

355
00:25:44,973 --> 00:25:48,238
- Thank you.
- No place to go

356
00:25:48,309 --> 00:25:52,803
<i>I'm home about 8:00
just me and my radio</i>

357
00:25:52,881 --> 00:25:55,782
<i>Ain't misbehavin'</i>

358
00:25:55,850 --> 00:25:58,375
<i>Savin' all my love for you</i>

359
00:26:22,544 --> 00:26:25,308
- Hey! Whoo!
- Come back here.

360
00:26:56,711 --> 00:26:58,941
<i>I don't stay out late</i>

361
00:26:59,013 --> 00:27:01,447
<i>Got no place to go</i>

362
00:27:01,516 --> 00:27:06,453
<i>I'm home about 8:00
just me and my radio</i>

363
00:27:06,521 --> 00:27:09,354
<i>Ain't misbehavin'</i>

364
00:27:09,424 --> 00:27:14,157
<i>Savin' my love for you</i>

365
00:27:20,468 --> 00:27:23,733
Ada, I sure hate
to steal your band away.

366
00:27:23,805 --> 00:27:27,297
Oh, that's all right.
You're taking a liability off my hands.

367
00:27:27,375 --> 00:27:29,468
Why don't you fold up this joint?

368
00:27:29,544 --> 00:27:31,637
You know, I could use you
in the show too.

369
00:27:31,713 --> 00:27:33,806
- You could?
- Sure could.

370
00:27:33,881 --> 00:27:38,545
Oh, boy! This joint is folding
as of Saturday night.

371
00:27:38,620 --> 00:27:43,284
- What?
- Guess you're out of employment again.

372
00:27:43,358 --> 00:27:46,293
<i>You're high and outside.</i>

373
00:27:46,361 --> 00:27:49,194
- I'm going to tell Fats.
- Aren't you Bill Williamson?

374
00:27:49,263 --> 00:27:51,254
- Huh?
- Sure you are.

375
00:27:51,332 --> 00:27:53,357
- Hello, Selina.
- Gee, I'm glad to see you.

376
00:27:53,434 --> 00:27:55,425
- What are you doing down here?
- Dancing.

377
00:27:55,503 --> 00:27:57,528
But on account
of the bartender being sick...

378
00:27:57,605 --> 00:27:59,596
the cook had to take
the bartender's place...

379
00:27:59,674 --> 00:28:01,699
the waiter took the cook's place...

380
00:28:01,776 --> 00:28:03,767
and I had to take the waiter's place.

381
00:28:03,845 --> 00:28:05,870
- Gee, I'd love to see your act, Bill.
- Oh, waiter.

382
00:28:05,947 --> 00:28:07,938
Bring me another pack
of cigarettes, will ya?

383
00:28:08,016 --> 00:28:10,678
- Yes, sir, boss.
- Say, Chick.

384
00:28:10,752 --> 00:28:13,585
I want you to do me a favor.
I want you to put Bill in the show.

385
00:28:13,655 --> 00:28:16,283
- Doing what?
- He's a terrific dancer.

386
00:28:16,357 --> 00:28:18,382
But, Selina,
dancers are a nickel a dozen.

387
00:28:18,459 --> 00:28:20,689
Maybe so, but he was Clem's buddy.

388
00:28:20,762 --> 00:28:23,196
I want to help him if I can.

389
00:28:23,264 --> 00:28:26,825
- All right, Selina. He's in.
- Aw, thanks, Chick.

390
00:28:26,901 --> 00:28:29,426
Bill, how soon can you leave for Chicago?

391
00:28:29,504 --> 00:28:31,938
I'm on the outskirts of Peoria right now.

392
00:28:32,006 --> 00:28:34,668
- Chick's gonna put you in the show.
- Sure enough?

393
00:28:34,742 --> 00:28:37,142
Yep. I've got just the spot for you.

394
00:28:37,211 --> 00:28:40,476
I'm gonna put you right on top.

395
00:28:40,548 --> 00:28:43,415
And did he put you on top,
Uncle Bill, like he said?

396
00:28:43,484 --> 00:28:46,112
Mm-hmm.
He put me on top, all right.

397
00:28:48,489 --> 00:28:50,218
<i>Hey, you, get your wig on.</i>

398
00:29:03,905 --> 00:29:08,239
<i>There's a spot
I know a place they call Samoa by the Sea</i>

399
00:29:08,309 --> 00:29:10,504
<i>Talkin' there's not the most</i>

400
00:29:10,578 --> 00:29:12,808
<i>They palaver on the coast</i>

401
00:29:12,880 --> 00:29:16,782
<i>They command each other
understand each other perfectly</i>

402
00:29:16,851 --> 00:29:19,285
<i>If you're feeling fancy-free</i>

403
00:29:19,353 --> 00:29:21,344
<i>If you don't give 'em repartee</i>

404
00:29:21,422 --> 00:29:23,447
<i>To win a tropical maiden</i>

405
00:29:23,524 --> 00:29:25,754
<i>Doesn't need topical talk</i>

406
00:29:25,827 --> 00:29:27,818
<i>You maneuver
and if you approve her</i>

407
00:29:27,895 --> 00:29:30,125
<i>You can win her love in a walk</i>

408
00:29:30,198 --> 00:29:34,760
<i>Zulu man is feelin' blue
Hear his heart beat a little tattoo</i>

409
00:29:34,836 --> 00:29:38,670
<i>Diga diga doo, diga doo doo
Diga diga doo, diga doo</i>

410
00:29:38,740 --> 00:29:43,611
<i>You love me and I love you
The idea's old but the method is new</i>

411
00:29:43,744 --> 00:29:47,703
<i>Diga diga doo, diga doo doo
Diga diga doo, diga doo</i>

412
00:29:47,781 --> 00:29:51,877
<i>I'm so very diga diga doo by nature</i>

413
00:29:51,952 --> 00:29:56,719
<i>If you don't say diga diga to your mate
you're gonna lose a papa</i>

414
00:29:56,790 --> 00:30:00,749
<i>So if you want to be in style
way down on that tropical isle</i>

415
00:30:00,828 --> 00:30:02,921
<i>Say diga diga doo diga doo doo</i>

416
00:30:02,997 --> 00:30:05,431
<i>Diga diga doo, diga doo</i>

417
00:31:14,735 --> 00:31:16,760
Gee, Selina,
you were wonderful.

418
00:31:16,837 --> 00:31:19,670
- How about a sandwich after the show?
- That sounds swell to me, Bill.

419
00:31:19,740 --> 00:31:23,198
- I'd love to.
- Okay. I'll see you later.

420
00:31:23,277 --> 00:31:25,302
- It's a date.
- But you can't, Selina.

421
00:31:25,379 --> 00:31:27,609
I don't want her seen
around those cheap lunchrooms.

422
00:31:27,681 --> 00:31:29,672
- Don't be like that, Chick.
- But it isn't good for the show...

423
00:31:29,750 --> 00:31:31,775
and I'm running the show.

424
00:31:31,852 --> 00:31:34,685
Yes, but after the show is over,
I do as I please.

425
00:31:34,755 --> 00:31:36,780
We'll see about that.

426
00:31:36,857 --> 00:31:39,291
If you're thinking
what's good for the show...

427
00:31:39,360 --> 00:31:41,555
why don't you let me
go out and do my dance?

428
00:31:41,629 --> 00:31:44,689
What? Let you do your cheap hoofing
in a classy show like this?

429
00:31:44,765 --> 00:31:46,995
Why, they'd walk out on you.

430
00:31:47,067 --> 00:31:49,058
Listen, Mr. Big Shot.

431
00:31:49,136 --> 00:31:51,161
The only reason they ain't
walking out on you...

432
00:31:51,238 --> 00:31:53,229
is because it's raining out.

433
00:31:53,307 --> 00:31:55,332
Yeah? Well, if you want
to stay in this show...

434
00:31:55,409 --> 00:31:57,639
just do your stuff
on the drums, that's all.

435
00:31:57,711 --> 00:32:00,771
Just do your stuff on the drums.

436
00:32:03,117 --> 00:32:05,142
That's just what I'm gonna do.

437
00:32:08,555 --> 00:32:11,752
<i>Fire</i>

438
00:32:15,429 --> 00:32:21,265
<i>The low beating of the tom-toms</i>

439
00:32:23,137 --> 00:32:28,973
<i>The slow beating of the tom-toms</i>

440
00:32:31,679 --> 00:32:35,171
<i>Low, slow</i>

<i>Whirls softly</i>

<i>Slowly</i>

<i>And the tom-toms beat</i>

454
00:33:26,767 --> 00:33:28,962
- What's he doing?
- What's he doing?

455
00:33:29,036 --> 00:33:31,664
He's fixin' to tie
the show up in knots.

456
00:33:31,739 --> 00:33:33,764
Look at 'em out there.
They love it.

457
00:33:33,841 --> 00:33:36,071
Bill, you's out
of employment again.

458
00:33:36,143 --> 00:33:39,044
And look at Chick.
He's thinks he's wowing them.

459
00:33:39,113 --> 00:33:41,104
<i>Stirs</i>

460
00:33:41,181 --> 00:33:43,172
<i>Your</i>

461
00:33:43,250 --> 00:33:46,913
<i>Blood</i>

462
00:33:56,029 --> 00:33:58,361
<i>The tom-toms beat</i>

463
00:33:58,432 --> 00:34:01,094
<i>And the tom-toms beat</i>

464
00:34:01,168 --> 00:34:03,796
<i>And the low beating
of the tom-toms</i>

465
00:34:03,871 --> 00:34:07,170
<i>Stirs your</i>

466
00:34:07,241 --> 00:34:12,144
<i>Blood</i>

467
00:34:14,515 --> 00:34:16,506
Boy, I've never known
that number to go better.

468
00:34:16,583 --> 00:34:18,778
That's right.
You were terrific.

469
00:34:34,935 --> 00:34:37,165
<i>Come in.</i>

470
00:34:37,237 --> 00:34:39,467
<i>- Well, he fired me.
- Yes, I know.</i>

471
00:34:39,540 --> 00:34:42,168
But I don't care.
You know, I just had to do it, Selina.

472
00:34:42,242 --> 00:34:44,233
Well, I don't blame you, Bill.

473
00:34:44,311 --> 00:34:46,336
If it wasn't for making
trouble for you...

474
00:34:46,413 --> 00:34:49,246
I'd hang a sign on that guy's eye-
"closed for the season."

475
00:34:49,316 --> 00:34:53,013
Well, don't let me stop you.
Does that invitation to a sandwich still go?

476
00:34:53,086 --> 00:34:55,077
It sure does. The lunchroom?

477
00:34:55,155 --> 00:34:57,385
Ah, that sounds like a great place to me.

478
00:34:57,458 --> 00:34:59,653
<i>Come in.</i>

479
00:35:01,228 --> 00:35:03,219
Say, didn't I tell you
to get out of my theater?

480
00:35:03,297 --> 00:35:05,857
And didn't I tell you I'd get out
when I get good and ready?

481
00:35:05,933 --> 00:35:08,731
- Well, you're ready now.
- That's right.

482
00:35:08,802 --> 00:35:10,895
Ready, willing and able.

483
00:35:10,971 --> 00:35:13,064
Come on, Selina.

484
00:35:18,312 --> 00:35:21,748
One never knows, do one?

485
00:35:25,953 --> 00:35:29,081
That's just like Chick.
He ain't changed a bit.

486
00:35:29,156 --> 00:35:31,181
What happened after
you socked him, Uncle Bill?

487
00:35:31,258 --> 00:35:33,249
Oh, we had our ups and downs-

488
00:35:33,327 --> 00:35:35,420
more downs than ups at first.

489
00:35:35,496 --> 00:35:38,693
- Did you keep on dancing?
- Sure. That's when I invented that Bill Williamson step.

490
00:35:38,765 --> 00:35:41,393
- You remember that, don't you, honey?
- Yes.

491
00:35:41,468 --> 00:35:44,301
Come on, let me see
if you can do it. You ready? Go.

492
00:35:53,780 --> 00:35:56,613
Why, you haven't forgotten it.
You did that fine.

493
00:35:56,683 --> 00:35:59,743
- What's this?
- Well, well. Look at this.

494
00:36:01,889 --> 00:36:04,323
It looks like Gabe
is still out of money.

495
00:36:04,391 --> 00:36:07,053
Just like my old man.

496
00:36:07,127 --> 00:36:09,118
What happened to Gabe,
Uncle Bill?

497
00:36:09,196 --> 00:36:11,221
Oh, we kind of lost track
of him for a few years.

498
00:36:11,298 --> 00:36:13,732
- Did he quit promotin'?
- Well, he did and he didn't.

499
00:36:13,800 --> 00:36:16,428
You see, I was trying
to open a show in New York...

500
00:36:16,503 --> 00:36:19,336
and having a peck of a lot
of trouble about money.

501
00:36:19,406 --> 00:36:22,671
I was walking down the street
in Harlem that day.

502
00:36:28,181 --> 00:36:30,809
- No, it ain't.
- Yes, it is.

503
00:36:30,884 --> 00:36:32,909
- Well, I'll be doggone.
- How you doin'?

504
00:36:32,986 --> 00:36:34,977
Ain't doin' so bad.
Thank you.

505
00:36:35,055 --> 00:36:37,114
Imagine me comin'
here for a shine and finding you.

506
00:36:37,190 --> 00:36:39,590
Get right on up there,
'cause this one's on the house.

507
00:36:39,660 --> 00:36:42,094
- Lord, I been reading about you.
- Yeah?

508
00:36:42,162 --> 00:36:44,756
Yeah. Funny thing, I was coming down
to catch the show tonight...

509
00:36:44,831 --> 00:36:46,822
and comin' back and ask for you.

510
00:36:46,900 --> 00:36:49,164
- Oh, man, it don't look like there's gonna be no show.
- How come?

511
00:36:49,236 --> 00:36:51,295
All the chorus girls
ganged up and refused to work...

512
00:36:51,371 --> 00:36:53,771
- unless they get paid for last week's rehearsal.
- What?

513
00:36:53,840 --> 00:36:56,468
But if I could get open tonight,
I'd be out in front.

514
00:36:56,543 --> 00:37:00,206
- Well, how much money do you need?
- I need exactly $560.

515
00:37:00,280 --> 00:37:02,305
Ain't you got that much
in the box office?

516
00:37:02,382 --> 00:37:04,782
No, that's been attached
for the costumes and scenery.

517
00:37:04,851 --> 00:37:08,548
Well, buddy, if that's all that's
worrying you, your worries is over.

518
00:37:08,622 --> 00:37:10,647
You got yourself a new agent.

519
00:37:10,724 --> 00:37:13,352
You mean to tell me you got $560?

520
00:37:13,427 --> 00:37:17,124
No, I ain't got 560 cents,
but I got an idea.

521
00:37:17,197 --> 00:37:20,496
I got ideas too,
but what I need is money.

522
00:37:20,567 --> 00:37:22,660
Now, you listen to me.

523
00:37:22,736 --> 00:37:25,034
If you look prosperous
and sweet-talk them gals...

524
00:37:25,105 --> 00:37:29,201
they'll be so busy figuring out how to
make you spend what they think you got...

525
00:37:29,276 --> 00:37:32,302
that they ain't got no time to worry
about how much money you ain't got.

526
00:37:32,379 --> 00:37:34,404
Look here, Gabe,
what are you driving at?

527
00:37:34,481 --> 00:37:36,506
Just leave that to me.
Leave it to me.

528
00:37:36,583 --> 00:37:38,574
You just go on back down
to that theater...

529
00:37:38,652 --> 00:37:40,882
and tell them gals
that Gabriel the angel is coming.

530
00:37:40,954 --> 00:37:43,184
You ain't gonna have no trouble
stalling them gals, is you?

531
00:37:43,256 --> 00:37:46,089
- Oh, no. I'll see you.
- All right, buddy. I'll be out-

532
00:37:46,159 --> 00:37:49,856
<i>- My rent is due!
- I need cash money.</i>

533
00:37:49,930 --> 00:37:52,364
All you keep doing
is flapping your big mouth.

534
00:37:52,432 --> 00:37:54,866
- You say too much and you do too little.
- Girls, girls, girls.

535
00:37:54,935 --> 00:37:58,564
Listen. The angel is on his way,
and he'll be here any minute.

536
00:37:58,639 --> 00:38:02,166
<i>Oh, we've heard that before.</i>

537
00:38:02,242 --> 00:38:04,938
I guess that's old Gabriel
blowing his horn now.

538
00:38:05,012 --> 00:38:07,105
Might be.

539
00:38:14,080 --> 00:38:16,014
- Gabe!
- Evening, William!

540
00:38:16,082 --> 00:38:18,243
- Shake hands with Mr. Miller.
- Mr. Miller.

541
00:38:18,318 --> 00:38:20,980
Girls, this is your new boss,
Mr. Gabriel Tucker.

542
00:38:21,054 --> 00:38:24,319
- He's even got an angel's name.
- But he doesn't look the part.

543
00:38:24,391 --> 00:38:27,758
- All right, everybody, inside. This way, Gabe.
- Okay, Willie.

544
00:38:27,828 --> 00:38:29,819
- Wait a minute.
- Where's the money?

545
00:38:29,896 --> 00:38:32,922
Ladies, after all. Let's do this
in a businesslike manner.

546
00:38:32,999 --> 00:38:37,299
- Let's proceed, William.
- How do you like that?

547
00:38:41,775 --> 00:38:45,336
- He looks like ready money.
- Well, let's take a chance. We ain't got nothin' to lose.

548
00:38:45,412 --> 00:38:47,573
<i>Okay.</i>

549
00:38:47,647 --> 00:38:49,740
Come on, girls.

550
00:38:49,816 --> 00:38:53,274
I've seen that guy
somewhere before.

551
00:38:53,353 --> 00:38:55,378
Yeah?

552
00:38:57,190 --> 00:39:00,387
Come on, girls. Mr. Tucker
has something to say to you.

553
00:39:00,460 --> 00:39:03,122
Ladies, I understand that there's
a little matter of back salaries...

554
00:39:03,196 --> 00:39:05,221
which I am here to clear up.

555
00:39:05,298 --> 00:39:07,789
- That's right.
- Providing, of course-

556
00:39:07,868 --> 00:39:11,463
If I can see a little sample
of what I'm putting my money into.

557
00:39:11,538 --> 00:39:14,234
Maybe I could give you an idea.

558
00:39:14,307 --> 00:39:17,902
Vamp me, Professor. Vamp me.

559
00:39:17,978 --> 00:39:18,476
All right.

560
00:39:18,511 --> 00:39:21,275
All right.

561
00:39:25,218 --> 00:39:28,153
<i>Salt Lake City haunts me</i>

562
00:39:28,221 --> 00:39:31,713
<i>How that city taunts me</i>

563
00:39:31,791 --> 00:39:34,624
<i>Night and day I pine</i>

564
00:39:34,694 --> 00:39:39,859
<i>Salt Lake City on my mind</i>

565
00:39:41,635 --> 00:39:47,904
<i>Oh, I lost my sugar
in Salt Lake City</i>

566
00:39:47,974 --> 00:39:51,842
<i>Oh, why did I go there</i>

567
00:39:51,912 --> 00:39:57,851
<i>I should have stayed
down in New Orleans</i>

568
00:39:57,918 --> 00:40:01,877
<i>Never, never gone nowhere</i>

569
00:40:01,955 --> 00:40:05,413
<i>A gal with sweet talk</i>

570
00:40:05,492 --> 00:40:08,154
<i>From Kansas City</i>

571
00:40:08,228 --> 00:40:13,097
<i>Her words were sweet like wine</i>

572
00:40:13,166 --> 00:40:17,967
<i>She bought him diamonds
and limousines</i>

573
00:40:18,038 --> 00:40:23,874
<i>Stole that man of mine</i>

574
00:40:23,944 --> 00:40:27,436
<i>When night comes creepin'</i>

575
00:40:27,514 --> 00:40:31,382
<i>For me, there's no sleepin'</i>

576
00:40:31,451 --> 00:40:36,650
<i>What he sows he'll be reapin'</i>

577
00:40:36,723 --> 00:40:41,888
<i>For he done me wrong</i>

578
00:40:41,962 --> 00:40:48,197
<i>Oh, how I cried my heart out
in Salt Lake City</i>

579
00:40:48,268 --> 00:40:52,295
<i>The day I heard the news</i>

580
00:40:52,372 --> 00:40:56,900
<i>He left me deep in my solitude</i>

581
00:40:56,977 --> 00:41:00,071
<i>With the Salt Lake</i>

582
00:41:00,146 --> 00:41:06,984
<i>The Salt Lake City blues</i>

583
00:42:12,819 --> 00:42:14,912
Ladies of the ensemble...

584
00:42:14,988 --> 00:42:18,754
I have decided to personally guarantee
the money that's coming to you all.

585
00:42:20,894 --> 00:42:24,990
You will find your pay envelope
at the stage door as you pass out tonight.

586
00:42:27,434 --> 00:42:32,838
And henceforth, you will
all receive a five-dollar raise.

587
00:42:37,577 --> 00:42:40,410
Why, it's Gabe, isn't it?
Hello, Gabe.

588
00:42:40,480 --> 00:42:43,108
- Oh, Selina, oh.
- Selina, come here a minute, honey.

589
00:42:43,183 --> 00:42:45,208
I got something
to tell you confidentially.

590
00:42:45,285 --> 00:42:47,480
Just a minute, Bill. I hardly
recognized you in those clothes.

591
00:42:47,554 --> 00:42:50,148
- Yeah, it's been a long time.
- Oh, I should say it has.

592
00:42:50,223 --> 00:42:54,592
Not since the night of the ball in New York,
when you pretended you knew Chick Bailey!

593
00:42:57,063 --> 00:42:59,361
Yeah, that was funny,
but don't let me detain you.

594
00:42:59,432 --> 00:43:01,457
Come on, honey.
You got to get dressed.

595
00:43:01,534 --> 00:43:03,968
Oh, and that
big limousine, remember?

596
00:43:04,037 --> 00:43:07,029
Bill and I've laughed about it
a hundred times.

597
00:43:07,107 --> 00:43:10,338
<i>- Haven't we, Bill?
- Yeah. Yeah.</i>

598
00:43:13,012 --> 00:43:17,176
- Boy, call a half-hour.
- But Mr. Williamson, we've got an hour yet.

599
00:43:17,250 --> 00:43:20,185
Listen, call a half-hour now,
and call it loud.

600
00:43:20,253 --> 00:43:22,244
All right.

601
00:43:22,322 --> 00:43:25,723
Bill always said if you didn't have
a nickel to your name, you'd still-

602
00:43:25,792 --> 00:43:29,319
- Half-hour! Half-hour.
- Come on, Selina. It's half-hour.

603
00:43:29,395 --> 00:43:31,420
- But my watch must be slow!
- It sure is!

604
00:43:35,735 --> 00:43:39,831
- I know I've "seed" that guy someplace before.
- Yeah? Where?

605
00:43:39,906 --> 00:43:43,137
I don't know.
The face is familiar...

606
00:43:43,209 --> 00:43:45,700
but I can't recollect
the surroundings I "seed" it in.

607
00:43:45,778 --> 00:43:47,769
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

608
00:43:49,249 --> 00:43:52,741
Was it a pool room?

609
00:43:52,819 --> 00:43:56,277
- No, no.
- I thought it might give you a cue.

610
00:43:57,323 --> 00:44:00,053
A barber shop?

611
00:44:00,126 --> 00:44:02,185
No, no.

612
00:44:02,262 --> 00:44:05,322
- Say, Cousin Jake. Do me a favor, please.
- Well, what?

613
00:44:05,398 --> 00:44:07,525
- Run outside and get me a box of candy.
- Candy?

614
00:44:07,600 --> 00:44:10,763
- You know, somethin' big and fancy.
- Well, how big and how fancy?

615
00:44:10,837 --> 00:44:13,067
Well, do the best you can
with three bucks, hear?

616
00:44:13,139 --> 00:44:15,505
Uh, okay, okay, okay.

617
00:44:25,952 --> 00:44:28,546
Clear outta here!

618
00:44:28,621 --> 00:44:31,112
- What's wrong with it?
- I d-

619
00:44:32,792 --> 00:44:35,556
- Where'd you have it fixed?
- I just had it worked on!

620
00:44:35,628 --> 00:44:38,563
- Who worked on it?
- The man that's got the garage-

621
00:44:38,631 --> 00:44:41,395
Well, he ain't no good.
The man you want is the man-

622
00:44:41,467 --> 00:44:44,163
I had him!
He's the one that ruined it!

623
00:44:47,707 --> 00:44:50,608
Well, I see you got plenty water,
but is you outta gas?

624
00:44:50,677 --> 00:44:56,707
<i>No, t'ain't that. I think maybe it's-</i>

625
00:44:56,783 --> 00:45:00,378
<i>- Oh, it couldn't be that.
- Well, there ain't much wrong with it.</i>

626
00:45:00,453 --> 00:45:02,614
What you need is some
of them new gadgets.

627
00:45:02,689 --> 00:45:04,953
You know,
the kind that you buy-

628
00:45:05,024 --> 00:45:07,458
- I just bought some.
- Oh, not them.

629
00:45:07,527 --> 00:45:10,428
I mean the kind what fastens
where they fits.

630
00:45:10,496 --> 00:45:13,829
- A whole dozen'll cost about-
- That's too much money.

631
00:45:13,900 --> 00:45:17,063
I can't afford it. I got to get
some that don't cost no more-

632
00:45:17,136 --> 00:45:19,127
You can't get 'em that cheap.

633
00:45:19,205 --> 00:45:23,471
Well, we can get the car
fixed up good maybe for around-

634
00:45:24,644 --> 00:45:28,239
No, what you need...

635
00:45:28,314 --> 00:45:30,305
- is a new car.
- Yeah.

636
00:45:30,383 --> 00:45:34,479
- The kind like my uncle had. He made a trip out-
- Did he go out there?

637
00:45:34,554 --> 00:45:37,523
- Sure!
- I thought all the time he was gonna go-

638
00:45:37,590 --> 00:45:40,923
- He did, but not that time.
- Well, what's he doin' now?

639
00:45:40,994 --> 00:45:44,452
Since he been back, he's been very busy
gettin' ready for what he thinks-

640
00:45:44,530 --> 00:45:46,760
- Is that so?
- Sure.

641
00:45:46,833 --> 00:45:50,166
- Well, I guess like all bachelors, he's-
- No, no. Not him.

642
00:45:50,236 --> 00:45:52,261
- He gonna get married.
- He is?

643
00:45:52,338 --> 00:45:54,829
Yeah, he's gonna marry the widow
whose husband used to be-

644
00:45:54,907 --> 00:45:56,932
- She's a fine lady!
- Mm-hmm.

645
00:45:57,010 --> 00:45:59,001
But listen-

646
00:45:59,078 --> 00:46:02,946
- I heard that one time she-
- That was her daughter!

647
00:46:03,016 --> 00:46:05,507
- Oh.
- You see, I'm keeping company with her.

648
00:46:05,585 --> 00:46:08,713
- You is?
- Yeah, I been engaged to her ever since the time-

649
00:46:08,788 --> 00:46:11,382
- I didn't know you knowed her that long.
- Sure!

650
00:46:11,457 --> 00:46:16,190
I worked with her brother. And one day
on the job, the first thing I know-

651
00:46:16,262 --> 00:46:20,289
That was your fault.
Now, what you should have done was-

652
00:46:20,366 --> 00:46:22,357
- I did!
- You see that?

653
00:46:22,435 --> 00:46:24,494
- Now that why I like talk to you.
- Yeah.

654
00:46:24,570 --> 00:46:26,629
'Cause me and you can
agree with one another.

655
00:46:26,706 --> 00:46:28,697
Sure!

656
00:46:28,775 --> 00:46:30,834
You know one thing.
When I get the car fixed up...

657
00:46:30,910 --> 00:46:33,208
I'm gonna take you and your girl
out for a ride sometime.

658
00:46:33,279 --> 00:46:36,715
- That'll be great! Can you make it-
- I'll be busy then.

659
00:46:36,783 --> 00:46:39,718
- When can you make it?
- Let's see. The best day for me will-

660
00:46:39,786 --> 00:46:41,811
That'll suits me.
What hour?

661
00:46:41,888 --> 00:46:44,254
- Anytime between-
- That's a little early, but we'll be there.

662
00:46:44,324 --> 00:46:46,485
- All right, I'll be seein' ya.
- Later, bye-bye.

663
00:46:46,559 --> 00:46:48,754
Bon voy-

664
00:46:53,666 --> 00:46:57,830
That was awful nice of you,
honey, to promise us a raise in salary.

665
00:46:57,904 --> 00:46:59,895
Oh, that's trivial, honey, trivial.

666
00:46:59,972 --> 00:47:03,203
- I might even split my profits with you.
- Oh, really?

667
00:47:03,276 --> 00:47:05,267
<i>Wonderful.</i>

668
00:47:05,345 --> 00:47:07,404
Oh, that's my man.
Now, don't go away.

669
00:47:07,480 --> 00:47:09,573
I'll be right back in a second.

670
00:47:09,649 --> 00:47:12,948
Oh, that's swell. What-
All of this for three bucks?

671
00:47:13,019 --> 00:47:15,886
Uh, the candy may be
a little stale, but it's a nice box.

672
00:47:15,955 --> 00:47:17,946
Thank you.
Thank you, Cousin Jake.

673
00:47:18,024 --> 00:47:22,484
- Isn't he wonderful?
- Edna Mae, I believe you've taken a shine to that angel.

674
00:47:22,562 --> 00:47:25,463
- Shine? Did you say shine?
- Yes.

675
00:47:25,531 --> 00:47:27,556
Doggone it.
I know I saw him somewhere.

676
00:47:27,633 --> 00:47:29,624
- He's a bootblack.
- Who?

677
00:47:29,702 --> 00:47:32,728
That angel. He ain't no angel.
He's got a shinin' stand in Harlem.

678
00:47:32,805 --> 00:47:36,866
- He shined my shoes a thousand times.
- What? A bootblack?

679
00:47:36,943 --> 00:47:40,879
- Come on, kids.
- I'm so mad, I don't know what to do.

680
00:47:41,948 --> 00:47:44,041
Listen, girls!

681
00:47:50,656 --> 00:47:52,886
This is me, kiddies, Gabe.

682
00:47:52,959 --> 00:47:54,984
I've got a surprise for you.

683
00:47:55,061 --> 00:47:58,326
<i>Come in, deary.
We've got a surprise for you too.</i>

684
00:47:58,398 --> 00:48:00,958
All right, honey.
Now, here is somethin' for you.

685
00:48:01,033 --> 00:48:05,129
Now, this is-

686
00:48:07,507 --> 00:48:09,634
- What's the matter? What's wrong?
- I don't know.

687
00:48:09,709 --> 00:48:13,770
Girls! Girls! Just a minute!
What are you all trying to do?

688
00:48:13,846 --> 00:48:15,973
What's the trouble in here?
They can hear you out front.

689
00:48:16,048 --> 00:48:19,484
There's plenty of trouble.
We're not going on till we get our money!

690
00:48:19,552 --> 00:48:21,577
But, girls, you've got to finish the show.

691
00:48:21,654 --> 00:48:24,623
If I have to give the people their
money back tonight, I will be ruined.

692
00:48:24,690 --> 00:48:27,090
- I'm ruined now.
- He reminds me of-

693
00:48:27,160 --> 00:48:29,424
No. He looks worse than that.

694
00:48:29,495 --> 00:48:33,192
If it's money you all are worried about,
I think I have the solution to your problem.

695
00:48:33,266 --> 00:48:35,291
Cousin Jake, where did you get
all that money?

696
00:48:35,368 --> 00:48:38,303
Uh, I drove my boss
to Belmont Park today.

697
00:48:38,371 --> 00:48:41,602
- You mean, there was a coincident?
- What you mean?

698
00:48:41,674 --> 00:48:44,165
That the right horse
came in at the right time...

699
00:48:44,243 --> 00:48:46,438
and on the right track
at the right odds?

700
00:48:46,512 --> 00:48:48,639
- Uh, yeah!
- As we live and breathe!

701
00:49:05,298 --> 00:49:12,466
<i>I can't give you anything but love</i>

702
00:49:12,538 --> 00:49:15,405
<i>Baby</i>

703

00:49:21,547 --> 00:49:23,538

706
00:49:28,888 --> 00:49:33,348
<i>We're sure to find</i>

707
00:49:33,426 --> 00:49:37,522
<i>Happiness and I guess</i>

708
00:49:37,597 --> 00:49:42,091
<i>All those things you've always pined for</i>

709
00:49:42,168 --> 00:49:47,902
<i>Gee, I like to see you looking swell</i>

710
00:49:47,974 --> 00:49:49,965
<i>Baby</i>

711
00:49:51,644 --> 00:49:57,446
<i>Diamond bracelets
Woolworth doesn't sell</i>

712
00:49:57,517 --> 00:49:59,883
<i>Baby</i>

713
00:49:59,952 --> 00:50:05,151

00:50:08,594 --> 00:50:13,964
<i>I can't give you anything but love</i>

716
00:50:16,636 --> 00:50:20,538
<i>- Can't give you anything but love
- Love</i>

717
00:50:20,606 --> 00:50:22,938
<i>I left you love, baby</i>

718
00:50:23,009 --> 00:50:29,642
<i>That's the only thing I've plenty of, baby</i>

719
00:50:29,715 --> 00:50:33,481

00:50:43,563 --> 00:50:47,294
<i>- Baby, you're lookin' swell

724
00:50:47,366 --> 00:50:49,994
<i>Baby</i>

725
00:50:50,069 --> 00:50:53,402
<i>Diamond and rings and jivin' things</i>

726
00:50:53,472 --> 00:50:56,134
<i>Woolworth doesn't sell them, baby</i>

727
00:50:56,208 --> 00:51:01,669

00:51:30,376 --> 00:51:34,142

<i>Anything but love</i>

732
00:51:50,429 --> 00:51:53,057
When did you go
to Hollywood, Uncle Bill?

733
00:51:53,132 --> 00:51:56,124
Honey, the first time
I went to Hollywood was 1936.

734
00:51:56,202 --> 00:51:58,898
- Did Miss Selina go with you?
- No, she didn't go.

735
00:51:58,971 --> 00:52:03,874
- How come?
- When two people can't seem the same thing the same way...

736
00:52:03,943 --> 00:52:06,639
life just gets powerful complicated.

737
00:52:06,712 --> 00:52:08,703
You see, honey,
this is the living room...

738
00:52:08,781 --> 00:52:12,376
here's your room,
and this is the nursery.

739
00:52:12,451 --> 00:52:16,979
Oh, that's swell, Bill. That's about
the prettiest little house I ever saw.

740
00:52:17,056 --> 00:52:19,684
- But not for us.
- Why not for us?

741
00:52:19,759 --> 00:52:24,423
You know why not for us. We're show
people, on the road day in and day out.

742
00:52:24,497 --> 00:52:27,091
We don't have time
to live in a house like that.

743
00:52:27,166 --> 00:52:29,896
Sure, that's the way it's been
up until now, honey. But-

744
00:52:29,969 --> 00:52:32,665
Oh, but Bill, we've been
over this a thousand times.

745
00:52:32,738 --> 00:52:36,435
I know, but since I've got that Hollywood
contract, we'll have plenty of money.

746
00:52:36,509 --> 00:52:39,889
- You won't have to go on workin'. You can quit.
- Quit?

747
00:52:40,022 --> 00:52:43,958
Sure. You worked long enough.
It's time that you settled down.

748
00:52:44,026 --> 00:52:46,017
And we have a home and-

749
00:52:46,095 --> 00:52:48,120
But, Bill, I don't wanna quit.

750
00:52:48,197 --> 00:52:52,190
I wouldn't be happy unless
I went on with my work, just like you.

751
00:52:52,268 --> 00:52:55,795
Singing's in my blood.

752
00:52:55,871 --> 00:53:01,468
I'm sorry, Selina. I just thought
maybe you'd see it different now.

753
00:53:01,544 --> 00:53:04,479
Bill, I'm afraid I'll never
see it differently.

754
00:53:04,547 --> 00:53:06,538
Never.

755
00:53:08,551 --> 00:53:10,917
I'm sorry too.

756
00:53:24,967 --> 00:53:28,403
Selina, then she went to Paris
and got to be a big star over there.

757
00:53:28,470 --> 00:53:30,631
Didn't Miss Selina ever
come back, Uncle Bill?

758
00:53:30,706 --> 00:53:33,675
<i>Not yet.</i>

759
00:53:41,550 --> 00:53:45,384
- Cab Calloway!
- Hi-de-hi-de-ho

760
00:53:45,454 --> 00:53:47,479
Hi-de-hi-de-ho

761
00:53:47,556 --> 00:53:50,650
<i>- Ho-de-ho
- Ho-de-ho</i>

762
00:53:52,528 --> 00:53:54,723
<i>Hello, Cab!</i>

763
00:53:54,797 --> 00:53:58,324
Hello, Pops. What's all of this?
You never told me 'bout this jive.

764
00:53:58,400 --> 00:54:01,858
I wish they were mine. The neighbor's
kids, just trying to show 'em a few steps.

765
00:54:01,937 --> 00:54:05,737
Run along, kids. See you later.

766
00:54:05,808 --> 00:54:09,574
- Come over and sit down.
- Bill, I guess you ain't as lonesome out here as I thought.

767
00:54:09,645 --> 00:54:12,045
Yes, it's lonesome all right.

768
00:54:12,114 --> 00:54:16,073
But I hate to give up the place in case Selina
ever change her mind and wanna come back.

769
00:54:16,151 --> 00:54:18,176
- But what are you doin' out here?
- Oh!

770
00:54:18,253 --> 00:54:21,381
Tonight we givin' a big party
at the Downtown Club for the soldiers.

771
00:54:21,457 --> 00:54:25,587
- For the soldiers?
- Sure! A big blow-out before they go overseas.

772
00:54:25,661 --> 00:54:29,859
- Bill, I want you to be there.
- You bet I'll be there. Anything for the soldiers.

773
00:55:23,385 --> 00:55:29,119
<i>Way down in Charleston
lives old Geechy Joe</i>

774
00:55:32,161 --> 00:55:37,189
<i>Going way down to Charleston</i>

775
00:55:37,266 --> 00:55:39,996
<i>To dig old Geechy Joe</i>

776
00:55:42,538 --> 00:55:45,632
<i>Got a good old geechy urge</i>

777
00:55:45,708 --> 00:55:50,543
<i>Can't do nothin' else but go</i>

778
00:55:52,748 --> 00:55:55,683
<i>Got misery</i>

779
00:55:55,751 --> 00:55:59,778
<i>Misery I can't lose</i>

780
00:56:02,091 --> 00:56:05,185
<i>Got misery</i>

781
00:56:05,260 --> 00:56:08,593
<i>Nothin' but bad news</i>

782
00:56:11,834 --> 00:56:14,166
<i>Then I dig old Geechy Joe</i>

783
00:56:14,236 --> 00:56:18,866
<i>So he can voodoo
those lonesome blues</i>

784
00:56:21,610 --> 00:56:24,078
<i>Gotta get back to Charleston</i>

785
00:56:24,146 --> 00:56:28,606
<i>If I have to walk down
that railroad track</i>

786
00:56:30,753 --> 00:56:36,020
<i>Rub a hand on a lodestone</i>

787
00:56:36,091 --> 00:56:38,992
<i>Blue is black</i>

788
00:56:40,629 --> 00:56:43,427
<i>If old Geechy Joe can get it</i>

789
00:56:43,499 --> 00:56:45,831
<i>I'm never, never, never,
never, never, never, never</i>

790
00:56:45,901 --> 00:56:49,132
<i>Coming back</i>

791
00:56:51,907 --> 00:56:56,640
<i>Whoa</i>

792
00:56:56,712 --> 00:57:01,843
<i>Yeah</i>

793
00:57:01,917 --> 00:57:05,785
<i>Whoa</i>

00:57:05,854 --> 00:57:09,187
<i>Comin' home</i>

<i>Coming home</i>

797
00:57:28,477 --> 00:57:31,002
Be like old times.

798
00:57:32,881 --> 00:57:36,282
- Why, t'ain't Gabe.
- Well, if this ain't a solid send out.

799
00:57:36,351 --> 00:57:38,581
What do you know, Pop?
Gimme some skin.

800
00:57:38,654 --> 00:57:40,918
Mellow. Now lay your racket, jack.

801
00:57:40,989 --> 00:57:44,254
Say, this cat ain't hep to the jive.
Stop beatin' up your chops to him.

802
00:57:44,326 --> 00:57:47,227
Now, ain't that a bring-down.
That's a wrong riff, jack.

803
00:57:47,296 --> 00:57:49,491
Say, what the devil
you two fools talkin' about?

804
00:57:49,565 --> 00:57:53,626
We're talkin' jive. He says he's glad
to see you, and he wants to shake your hand.

805
00:57:53,702 --> 00:57:56,000
- Solid. -
Righteous. - Crazy.

806
00:57:56,071 --> 00:57:58,471
<i>- Go along, Cab.
- Okay.</i>

807
00:57:58,540 --> 00:58:01,941
Say, Bill. Come on. I want you to come
out front and catch this next number.

808
00:58:02,010 --> 00:58:06,003
- I'm quite sure that you'll get a great big kick out of it.
- Really?

809
00:58:06,081 --> 00:58:08,174
- Go ahead.
- I'll see you.

810
00:58:39,715 --> 00:58:45,153
<i>Don't know why</i>

811
00:58:45,220 --> 00:58:48,621
<i>There's no sun up in the sky</i>

812
00:58:48,690 --> 00:58:52,490
<i>Stormy weather</i>

813
00:58:52,561 --> 00:58:59,899
<i>Since my man and I ain't together</i>

814

<i>Keeps rainin' all the time</i>

815
00:59:09,778 --> 00:59:13,145
<i>Life is bare</i>

816
00:59:13,215 --> 00:59:17,914
<i>Gloom and misery everywhere</i>

817
00:59:17,986 --> 00:59:20,887
<i>Stormy weather</i>

818
00:59:20,956 --> 00:59:28,727
<i>Just can't get my poor self together</i>

819
00:59:28,797 --> 00:59:35,430
<i>I'm weary all the time</i>

820
00:59:35,504 --> 00:59:39,838
<i>The time</i>

821
00:59:39,908 --> 00:59:45,540
<i>So weary all the time</i>

822
00:59:45,614 --> 00:59:49,050
<i>Since he went away</i>

823
00:59:49,117 --> 00:59:52,280
<i>The blues walked in and met me</i>

824
00:59:52,354 --> 00:59:55,016
<i>If he stays away</i>

825
00:59:55,090 --> 00:59:59,584
<i>Old rockin' chair will get me</i>

826
00:59:59,661 --> 01:00:06,567
<i>All I do is pray
the lord above will let me</i>

827
01:00:06,635 --> 01:00:12,096
<i>Walk in the sun once more</i>

828
01:00:12,174 --> 01:00:17,134
<i>Can't go on</i>

829
01:00:17,212 --> 01:00:20,613
<i>Everything I had is gone</i>

833
01:00:37,799 --> 01:00:44,136
<i>Keeps rainin' all the time</i>

834
01:00:45,707 --> 01:00:51,907
<i>I'll walk around heavyhearted and sad</i>

835
01:00:51,980 --> 01:00:58,249
<i>Night comes around
and I'm still feeling bad</i>

836
01:00:58,320 --> 01:01:01,414
<i>Rain pourin' down</i>

837
01:01:01,490 --> 01:01:04,948
<i>Blindin' every hope I had</i>

838
01:01:05,027 --> 01:01:08,690
<i>This pitterin', patterin'
beatin' and scatterin'</i>

839
01:01:08,764 --> 01:01:11,358
<i>Drives me mad</i>

840
01:01:11,433 --> 01:01:18,498
<i>Love, love, love, love</i>

841
01:01:18,573 --> 01:01:22,009
<i>This misery</i>

842
01:01:22,077 --> 01:01:28,243
<i>Is just too much for me</i>

843
01:01:29,284 --> 01:01:34,483
<i>Can't go on</i>

01:01:48,737 --> 01:01:55,404
<i>Keeps rainin' all the time</i>

848
01:01:55,477 --> 01:02:01,416
<i>Keeps rainin' all</i>

849
01:02:01,483 --> 01:02:07,217
<i>The time</i>

850
01:05:18,833 --> 01:05:20,858
<i>Ooh</i>

851
01:05:20,935 --> 01:05:25,702
<i>Keeps rainin' all the time</i>

852
01:05:25,774 --> 01:05:27,867
<i>Keeps rainin' all the time</i>

01:05:27,942 --> 01:05:34,040
<i>- Keeps rainin' all the time

01:06:26,701 --> 01:06:29,431
- So you're goin' over, huh?
- Yes, sir!

862
01:06:29,504 --> 01:06:33,804
- And I hope to be with him soon.
- Oh, I envy your dad. I wished I had a boy like you.

863
01:06:33,875 --> 01:06:35,900
And so do I.

864
01:06:35,977 --> 01:06:38,673
<i>Hello, Bill.</i>

865
01:06:38,746 --> 01:06:41,909
Why, hello, Selina.
Did I hear you say something?

866
01:06:41,983 --> 01:06:43,974
- Yes, and I meant it too.
- But you always-

867
01:06:44,052 --> 01:06:46,612
<i>But a woman can change her mind.</i>

868
01:06:46,688 --> 01:06:49,782
You hear that?
"We want Williamson."

869
01:06:49,858 --> 01:06:53,988
<i>- Honey, you got him!
- We want Williamson.</i>

870
01:06:54,062 --> 01:06:56,189
And Williamson is the guy.

871
01:07:08,176 --> 01:07:10,542
<i>Where you goin' there, Mr. Bill</i>

872
01:07:10,612 --> 01:07:13,046
<i>I've got a date up on the hill</i>

873
01:07:13,114 --> 01:07:15,446
<i>You don't mean that pretty chick</i>

874
01:07:15,517 --> 01:07:18,008
<i>That's the one
I got to get there quick</i>

875
01:07:38,873 --> 01:07:41,398
<i>What's the matter, Bill
Go ahead</i>

876
01:07:41,476 --> 01:07:43,842
<i>I'm a fool who fears to tread</i>

877
01:07:43,912 --> 01:07:46,210
<i>Looks to me like you're in love</i>

878
01:07:46,281 --> 01:07:48,977
Come on, Cab, gimme a shove

879
01:08:19,414 --> 01:08:25,842
<i>It comes right out of the blue</i>

880
01:08:25,920 --> 01:08:28,718
<i>Like a cyclone</i>

881
01:08:28,790 --> 01:08:33,523
<i>Sweeps you right off your feet</i>

882
01:08:33,595 --> 01:08:35,586
<i>Right off</i>

883
01:08:35,663 --> 01:08:41,863
<i>Don't try to cut any corners</i>

884
01:08:41,936 --> 01:08:49,900
<i>You're heaven bound
on a one-way street</i>

885
01:08:49,978 --> 01:08:53,812
<i>The schemes you're dreamin' of</i>

886
01:08:55,283 --> 01:09:00,016
<i>Fit into your world like a glove</i>

887
01:09:02,056 --> 01:09:08,154
<i>Once you're hooked
your goose is cooked</i>

888
01:09:08,229 --> 01:09:14,293
<i>There's no two ways about love</i>

889
01:09:14,369 --> 01:09:23,641
<i>There's no two ways</i>

890
01:09:23,711 --> 01:09:27,408
<i>About love</i>

891
01:09:27,482 --> 01:09:31,851
<i>Mmm</i>

892
01:09:31,919 --> 01:09:35,582
<i>My, my. Ain't that somethin'?</i>

893
01:09:35,657 --> 01:09:37,955
You ain't seen nothin' yet.

894
01:09:38,026 --> 01:09:40,392
<i>Talk about a treat.</i>

895
01:09:40,461 --> 01:09:44,124
You should see that chick and me-

896
01:09:44,198 --> 01:09:46,291
<i>Struttin' down the street</i>

897
01:09:46,367 --> 01:09:49,768
<i>My, my
Ain't that something</i>

898
01:09:49,837 --> 01:09:52,169
Hear me shout

899
01:09:52,240 --> 01:09:54,765
<i>Mm-mm
Ain't that something</i>

900
01:09:54,842 --> 01:09:57,174
<i>Ain't that something
to shout about</i>

901
01:11:48,055 --> 01:11:50,148
<i>- Boy
- Whatcha gonna say there, gate</i>

902
01:11:50,224 --> 01:11:52,886
<i>- Oh, boy
- Whatcha gonna say there, gate</i>

903
01:11:52,960 --> 01:11:55,428
