1
00:03:28,341 --> 00:03:31,538
The water canal has reached
our village, Mother.

2
00:03:31,978 --> 00:03:34,708
The villagers want you
to inaugurate it.

3
00:03:36,149 --> 00:03:40,313
She refuses! You are our mother,
the mother of the whole village!

4
00:03:40,653 --> 00:03:43,383
Either you inaugurate it
or it will remain untouched!

5
00:03:44,824 --> 00:03:46,348
Mother, please...

6
00:08:43,823 --> 00:08:45,814
I speak the truth.

7
00:08:46,025 --> 00:08:50,325
The wedding was so grand that
everybody is talking about it.

8
00:08:50,730 --> 00:08:54,461
Of course. God has blessed
me with just one son.

9
00:08:57,003 --> 00:09:01,064
Nobody in our village holds
a torch to the bride in beauty.

10
00:09:01,707 --> 00:09:05,302
Of what use is mere beauty?
She should be talented, too.

11
00:09:05,578 --> 00:09:08,775
If God desires, she will be.

12
00:09:09,015 --> 00:09:13,418
I've heard something...
The villagers would say...

13
00:09:13,519 --> 00:09:15,953
Why have you stopped? Go on.

14
00:09:16,188 --> 00:09:19,248
Aunt, please don't feel offended.

15
00:09:19,725 --> 00:09:24,924
People say that you have mortgaged
your land for the wedding.

16
00:09:25,298 --> 00:09:28,665
Mortgaged my land!

17
00:09:28,935 --> 00:09:32,371
Let them say that in front of me!
I'll knock their teeth out!

18
00:09:32,572 --> 00:09:36,770
What hasn't God given me?
Don't I possess land?

19
00:09:36,976 --> 00:09:39,638
Plow? Bullocks?

20
00:09:39,845 --> 00:09:45,408
I've mortgaged land!

21
00:09:45,985 --> 00:09:50,081
Why are the villagers jealous?!

22
00:09:50,256 --> 00:09:52,816
My foot!

23
00:09:56,929 --> 00:09:59,955
I have mortgaged the land.

24
00:10:00,132 --> 00:10:04,125
If I wouldn't, how could
I celebrate the marriage?

25
00:10:04,303 --> 00:10:07,704
Who doesn't do it?

26
00:10:08,874 --> 00:10:13,140
If the bride is fortunate enough,
we'll get it released, too.

27
00:10:13,346 --> 00:10:16,406
She does look lucky.

28
00:10:52,118 --> 00:10:54,109
Let me do something.

29
00:10:54,654 --> 00:10:57,555
Fine. You do it.

30
00:11:07,733 --> 00:11:10,930
What have you done? A new bride
and you've removed your jewelry!

31
00:11:11,771 --> 00:11:14,467
Think of me, if not yourself.

32
00:11:14,840 --> 00:11:17,400
I haven't yet seen you properly.

33
00:11:17,610 --> 00:11:20,044
- Wear them.
- Sell them.

34
00:11:20,179 --> 00:11:23,580
- Are you mad?
- It will lighten the burden.

35
00:11:24,583 --> 00:11:26,312
What burden?

36
00:11:26,819 --> 00:11:28,844
Mother has mortgaged the land.

37
00:11:28,988 --> 00:11:31,650
That's a pack of lies!
The villagers make up stories!

38
00:11:31,824 --> 00:11:35,726
And even if she has, I'll throw the
money in the lender's face very soon!

39
00:11:37,263 --> 00:11:40,391
Somebody will see!
Mother might come. Let go.

40
00:11:40,566 --> 00:11:42,261
- So what?
- Won't you feel shy?

41
00:11:42,401 --> 00:11:44,266
Dump the shame in your basket!

42
00:11:46,505 --> 00:11:49,338
- I wish mother comes.
- Let her.

43
00:11:55,081 --> 00:12:00,280
I swear... they look good on you.

44
00:12:02,054 --> 00:12:07,924
I pray that they always remain
in my hands for you to see.

45
00:12:08,327 --> 00:12:10,591
Why won't they when I'm around?

46
00:12:10,763 --> 00:12:12,788
Then I'll take them off everyday.

47
00:12:14,433 --> 00:12:18,426
So you can put them on.

48
00:12:25,044 --> 00:12:29,071
Shameless man!

49
00:12:29,281 --> 00:12:33,684
Are you the only man in the
village to have got married?

50
00:12:33,886 --> 00:12:36,855
Anybody who sees this
will spit at you!

51
00:12:43,529 --> 00:12:46,327
And you too, daughter-in-law!
What can I say...

52
00:12:46,565 --> 00:12:50,023
Why should I blame you?
His father too was like him.

53
00:12:51,604 --> 00:12:56,735
Look at this! Light the fire first.

54
00:12:57,476 --> 00:13:00,172
What are you cooking? Your head?

55
00:13:03,783 --> 00:13:07,014
Don't drop it.

56
00:13:17,062 --> 00:13:18,962
Listen...

57
00:13:19,565 --> 00:13:21,499
Don't let him come too close.

58
00:13:21,967 --> 00:13:23,901
Stop it.

59
00:13:24,103 --> 00:13:26,071
He'll become worthless.

60
00:13:38,617 --> 00:13:43,486
Dear Kamla, walk carefully
lest your foot slips.

61
00:13:44,123 --> 00:13:48,890
- This is a woman's foot
not a man's. - Let's go.

62
00:13:49,428 --> 00:13:53,091
You are offended. I meant the pot.

63
00:13:53,365 --> 00:13:55,833
It's an earthen pot. Might break.

64
00:13:56,035 --> 00:14:00,404
With you alive, who can have
a copper pot on their heads?

65
00:14:00,706 --> 00:14:05,143
I want you to have pots
made of gold on your heads.

66
00:14:05,344 --> 00:14:08,438
But nobody cares. What times!

67
00:14:08,814 --> 00:14:11,112
Why are you arguing
with him? Let's go.

68
00:14:11,250 --> 00:14:13,912
Go and rinse your mouth.
It stinks!

69
00:14:14,119 --> 00:14:17,452
- Who is he?
- The village grocer.

70
00:14:17,690 --> 00:14:21,456
But he has a wicked heart.
We'll go together with lunch.

71
00:14:34,673 --> 00:14:36,937
You've come. Shamu's Radha has come

72
00:14:37,109 --> 00:14:39,475
You really take very long!

73
00:14:40,012 --> 00:14:41,707
Sit down.

74
00:14:45,684 --> 00:14:49,780
I think you should come here
with me in the morning itself.

75
00:14:49,989 --> 00:14:52,457
- And lunch?
- Don't worry about food.

76
00:14:52,858 --> 00:14:55,759
You are all I need.

77
00:14:57,396 --> 00:14:59,261
Delicious!

78
00:14:59,465 --> 00:15:03,162
- You cook very well.
- Is the salt okay?

79
00:15:03,335 --> 00:15:05,462
Don't talk about salt.

80
00:15:05,638 --> 00:15:09,404
You must only touch food.

81
00:15:10,209 --> 00:15:14,509
Everything will turn salty. You
don't know how salty your hands are!

82
00:15:15,247 --> 00:15:17,545
Where? See...

83
00:15:24,857 --> 00:15:28,850
The salt of the entire
village is in your hands!

84
00:15:29,128 --> 00:15:35,761
I swear. Let me see...
In two days your henna has faded.

85
00:15:36,068 --> 00:15:40,698
- So what?
- Nothing? You don't understand.

86
00:15:40,973 --> 00:15:46,138
A new bride shouldn't work
so hard. I feel hurt.

87
00:15:46,378 --> 00:15:50,075
New bride? It's 2 days
since we got married.

88
00:15:50,282 --> 00:15:54,776
It's not a few years!
Remain spruced for 2 months.

89
00:15:55,087 --> 00:15:58,853
This time won't return.
Let the other brides be jealous.

90
00:15:59,224 --> 00:16:01,124
Keep away. Somebody might watch us.

91
00:16:01,327 --> 00:16:03,921
- Nobody will see us.
- Let me go.

92
00:16:04,763 --> 00:16:07,027
This is a big problem!

93
00:16:07,299 --> 00:16:10,029
At home, you're scared of mother;
And here, the world! Are we sinning?

94
00:16:10,569 --> 00:16:12,594
Then the kids will come by!

95
00:16:16,709 --> 00:16:19,405
You're already counting the kids?

96
00:16:19,912 --> 00:16:23,143
- When God gives us the day...
- Gives? Of course He will.

97
00:16:24,783 --> 00:16:27,343
When we have children...

98
00:16:29,121 --> 00:16:31,885
A couple won't do. I need
4 healthy sons for the plow.

99
00:16:32,091 --> 00:16:34,025
One for each corner.

100
00:16:37,529 --> 00:16:41,226
Shambhu? Just wait!

101
00:20:20,886 --> 00:20:22,877
What's the matter?

102
00:20:45,077 --> 00:20:47,136
Shameless!

103
00:21:06,598 --> 00:21:09,066
Come and take some grains.
I'm very happy today.

104
00:21:09,434 --> 00:21:12,597
You also come and take some.

105
00:21:16,208 --> 00:21:19,439
What are you doing?

106
00:21:19,778 --> 00:21:22,542
You also take some.

107
00:21:22,714 --> 00:21:25,308
Be a little patient.

108
00:21:25,517 --> 00:21:29,954
You're not the only one to
become a father. Hold back.

109
00:21:30,789 --> 00:21:34,885
What do you know of the
joy of the birth of a son?

110
00:21:35,193 --> 00:21:37,661
You also take some.

111
00:21:38,230 --> 00:21:40,596
Aunt!

112
00:21:42,134 --> 00:21:45,729
Your voice sounds as it were
coming from a torn drum!

113
00:21:47,072 --> 00:21:49,438
- First congratulate us.
- You're worried about wishes?

114
00:21:49,641 --> 00:21:53,008
And your son is ruining me!
He's destroying the crop!

115
00:21:53,278 --> 00:21:55,940
If he must, let him
distribute his own share.

116
00:21:56,181 --> 00:21:57,671
Why is he touching my share?

117
00:21:58,050 --> 00:22:01,542
- Three fourths is our share.
- You keep forgetting.

118
00:22:01,787 --> 00:22:04,483
- Three parts are mine.
- What? - Of course.

119
00:22:04,690 --> 00:22:06,487
- Three are mine!
- No, mine.

120
00:22:06,658 --> 00:22:08,717
This is cheating.

121
00:22:10,395 --> 00:22:13,523
Get us to put our
thumb-impression on anything!

122
00:22:13,732 --> 00:22:16,064
I'll complain to the Panchayat!

123
00:22:18,236 --> 00:22:20,796
Think and decide, brothers.

124
00:22:21,039 --> 00:22:23,303
I help you in times of need.

125
00:22:25,777 --> 00:22:30,646
Till the principal amount
of rupees 500 is not paid...

126
00:22:30,849 --> 00:22:35,513
...3 parts of my crop of jowar
and pulses will go to...

127
00:22:35,654 --> 00:22:38,953
...the moneylender as interest.
- Hear that?

128
00:22:39,157 --> 00:22:41,057
And here is her thumb impression.

129
00:22:41,259 --> 00:22:45,286
Now tell the Village Council that
this is not your thumb-impression!

130
00:22:45,597 --> 00:22:47,861
God knows what nonsense you write!

131
00:22:48,066 --> 00:22:50,728
Talk of what we spoke.
I believe in spoken words.

132
00:22:50,936 --> 00:22:55,270
Didn't you say that one part of the
crop will be yours and 3 ours?

133
00:22:56,308 --> 00:23:00,472
Giving her due respect for
her age, I was being lenient.

134
00:23:00,679 --> 00:23:04,615
I gave her the money.
I couldn't even lift the bag.

135
00:23:04,950 --> 00:23:08,511
If you'll hang me for this,
I'll go straight to court!

136
00:23:08,787 --> 00:23:11,017
Who is afraid of courts?

137
00:23:11,556 --> 00:23:15,253
The courts are fair.
You'll be jailed instead!

138
00:23:15,527 --> 00:23:19,896
Listen to him!
He'll have me jailed!

139
00:23:20,365 --> 00:23:25,234
If I don't get the police and
claim the land, I'm not man enough!

140
00:23:26,738 --> 00:23:29,707
No, the police should
never enter our village!

141
00:23:30,375 --> 00:23:32,172
- Decide the issue here and now.
- What do you say?

142
00:23:32,411 --> 00:23:34,003
The police mustn't come here.

143
00:23:35,347 --> 00:23:38,043
Then you decide this.

144
00:23:38,483 --> 00:23:41,213
What do you decide?

145
00:23:41,420 --> 00:23:45,481
If it's the written word,
then you have to give it.

146
00:23:46,057 --> 00:23:49,686
Make Shamu also put his
thumb impression on this.

147
00:23:50,061 --> 00:23:53,553
One can't trust this old lady.
She's alive today. She may die soon.

148
00:23:53,865 --> 00:23:55,890
You'll die with your family!

149
00:23:56,234 --> 00:23:58,464
I'll go only after you're dead!

150
00:23:59,004 --> 00:24:01,837
You bullied the Council
into deciding in your favor!

151
00:24:02,174 --> 00:24:05,974
You're cheating my kids!
I pray to God to punish you!

152
00:24:06,445 --> 00:24:10,347
As long as I live, my son won't put
his thumb impression! Let's go.

153
00:27:31,449 --> 00:27:33,349
- Don't give him.
- Why?

154
00:27:33,585 --> 00:27:37,715
- He hasn't made me a catapult.
- I'll make it. Don't be angry.

155
00:27:40,392 --> 00:27:43,293
What is going on?

156
00:27:43,528 --> 00:27:47,020
Whom did you think this
belongs to? Beggars!

157
00:27:47,298 --> 00:27:49,596
- Put it back!
- He won't.

158
00:27:50,635 --> 00:27:54,628
The son is one step ahead
of his father!

159
00:27:55,607 --> 00:27:59,566
Now, my boy...
This has my share, too.

160
00:27:59,778 --> 00:28:01,769
You didn't plow the field.

161
00:28:02,013 --> 00:28:07,349
I've plowed 500 bucks
in your father's life.

162
00:28:07,585 --> 00:28:10,713
- Come here.
- What is it?

163
00:28:11,256 --> 00:28:12,985
You're a thief!

164
00:28:13,191 --> 00:28:14,920
- A thief?
- Yes.

165
00:28:15,093 --> 00:28:20,030
- Yes. You are a thief!
- Stay away!

166
00:28:20,532 --> 00:28:23,296
If I get angry, you've had it!

167
00:28:24,202 --> 00:28:26,102
Go and stop him.

168
00:28:26,304 --> 00:28:28,499
Doesn't matter. Let him be.

169
00:28:31,543 --> 00:28:33,511
My umbrella costing 5.50!

170
00:28:34,279 --> 00:28:39,216
I swear I'll add this money also
to your account! Remember that!

171
00:28:39,551 --> 00:28:42,247
He's ruined my umbrella!

172
00:28:46,591 --> 00:28:50,960
- Give it to him.
- My umbrella!

173
00:28:51,162 --> 00:28:53,528
Return it.

174
00:28:53,832 --> 00:28:56,926
Throwing it away? I've added
5.50 to your account!

175
00:29:02,373 --> 00:29:06,469
Your son would have
thrashed that man today.

176
00:29:06,711 --> 00:29:09,805
Grandma is a liar!

177
00:29:10,081 --> 00:29:12,743
- I was going to beat Ramu.
- But why?

178
00:29:12,984 --> 00:29:17,284
- He asked me to steal jaggery.
- He stole it, not me!

179
00:29:17,555 --> 00:29:20,956
- Why...
- Sit down!

180
00:29:22,160 --> 00:29:24,560
He's a devil!

181
00:29:24,796 --> 00:29:27,993
Don't call me a devil.
I'll fight back.

182
00:29:44,482 --> 00:29:47,383
- Mother, I'll eat with you.
- Me, too.

183
00:30:27,592 --> 00:30:30,356
Tell us a story!

184
00:30:30,762 --> 00:30:35,426
All right. Once upon a time,
there used to be a mouse.

185
00:30:35,633 --> 00:30:38,659
- He had four tails.
- Don't tell lies!

186
00:30:38,837 --> 00:30:43,206
A mouse does not have 4 tails.
It has just one.

187
00:30:43,474 --> 00:30:46,034
I'll tell you a story
about a lion.

188
00:30:47,679 --> 00:30:51,274
I strangled its neck...

189
00:30:51,482 --> 00:30:58,115
He started limping.
Then I sat astride the horse.

190
00:30:58,289 --> 00:31:00,723
And I escaped...

191
00:31:00,892 --> 00:31:09,061
And I find a lion. I pick
it up and carry it home.

192
00:31:09,300 --> 00:31:12,963
And I pet it gently.

193
00:31:13,471 --> 00:31:16,736
Then he dies.

194
00:31:17,108 --> 00:31:23,911
Then I bring another lion
and keep it in another house.

195
00:31:24,148 --> 00:31:28,175
Then a mouse comes slowly...

196
00:31:28,353 --> 00:31:31,220
And I kill it.

197
00:31:33,424 --> 00:31:35,756
Don't stop. Learn it fast.

198
00:31:36,094 --> 00:31:38,654
- Sir.
- Greetings.

199
00:31:39,264 --> 00:31:42,131
You've brought the younger one too.

200
00:31:42,367 --> 00:31:44,358
That's very nice.

201
00:31:44,569 --> 00:31:49,404
People say education
makes a man soft hearted.

202
00:31:49,874 --> 00:31:54,038
They just say it.
Am I soft hearted?

203
00:31:54,479 --> 00:31:59,178
Teach him carefully or
he'll teach you some things.

204
00:31:59,450 --> 00:32:05,184
Don't you worry. I have
set many rascals right.

205
00:32:05,924 --> 00:32:08,916
Teach him that much...

206
00:32:09,093 --> 00:32:14,531
...that he is able to read
all the money lender's books.

207
00:32:14,732 --> 00:32:18,668
Even the English
can't read his books.

208
00:32:18,937 --> 00:32:21,872
- I'll read them!
- Go and sit in your place.

209
00:32:23,341 --> 00:32:27,300
Don't punish my child.

210
00:32:27,478 --> 00:32:31,778
Without that, one can't
gain any knowledge.

211
00:32:32,150 --> 00:32:34,983
I must have been punished
at least 250 times.

212
00:32:35,153 --> 00:32:37,246
Only then have I learnt a little.

213
00:32:37,488 --> 00:32:41,356
It's essential to be punished.

214
00:32:41,693 --> 00:32:46,153
Thank God we are not educated
or he would have punished us too!

215
00:32:49,701 --> 00:32:53,694
Look at him!

216
00:32:53,972 --> 00:32:56,202
Get up! Why are you bent over?

217
00:32:56,474 --> 00:33:00,137
What are you doing here?
Go and sit in your seat.

218
00:33:00,979 --> 00:33:03,709
- I know everything!
- What do you know?

219
00:33:08,653 --> 00:33:10,416
Go to your place!

220
00:33:11,656 --> 00:33:13,487
Why are you beating my brother?

221
00:33:13,725 --> 00:33:16,023
Standing up for his brother!
First you bend over!

222
00:33:16,661 --> 00:33:20,028
Bend like a chicken!

223
00:33:23,601 --> 00:33:25,193
Put away the catapult!

224
00:33:25,370 --> 00:33:29,033
You're punishing my brother!
I won't spare you!

225
00:33:31,843 --> 00:33:34,744
Remain bound till morning.

226
00:33:35,747 --> 00:33:39,615
If you give him dinner,
I'll be really angry with you!

227
00:33:39,817 --> 00:33:41,910
Beats somebody!
Throws somebody's turban!

228
00:33:42,153 --> 00:33:43,984
Throws stones! What is this?

229
00:33:44,155 --> 00:33:47,886
The moon sits faraway
and eats in a plate.

230
00:33:48,159 --> 00:33:52,118
Grandma dies.

231
00:33:52,663 --> 00:33:55,689
Father got scared.

232
00:33:56,534 --> 00:33:59,059
Grandma will die!

233
00:34:03,508 --> 00:34:06,841
- You'll sleep hungry tonight.
- Mother will give me dinner.

234
00:34:07,211 --> 00:34:10,078
Give you dinner! Daughter-in-law...

235
00:34:10,281 --> 00:34:14,240
If you feed him, I'll tie you
up in his place. Be warned!

236
00:34:42,313 --> 00:34:45,373
She's gone to sleep.
Get my dinner.

237
00:35:01,666 --> 00:35:04,692
No dear. Leave my legs.

238
00:35:05,203 --> 00:35:07,637
- Go and untie him.
- Whom?

239
00:35:07,839 --> 00:35:11,570
- Your son.
- Let him be.

240
00:35:11,776 --> 00:35:16,213
It's so late. Go and untie him
and give him something to eat.

241
00:35:16,547 --> 00:35:19,072
What's the hurry? I'll give it.

242
00:35:19,350 --> 00:35:24,310
What a mother you are! In your
place I'd have fed him hours ago.

243
00:35:25,056 --> 00:35:27,616
- He's eating.
- Eating?

244
00:35:27,892 --> 00:35:29,951
You gave him food without asking me!

245
00:35:30,161 --> 00:35:33,255
- Am I dead?
- Grandma is dead!

246
00:36:01,526 --> 00:36:04,552
- What are you eating?
- Grams with jaggery.

247
00:36:07,732 --> 00:36:09,563
What's your name?

248
00:36:11,302 --> 00:36:14,135
Get lost! That's a boy's name.

249
00:36:14,372 --> 00:36:19,071
Should I tell you the truth?
My name is Rupa.

250
00:36:28,553 --> 00:36:31,613
What madness is this?

251
00:36:32,256 --> 00:36:34,520
He's just a child.

252
00:36:34,759 --> 00:36:37,887
He's stealing the grams from
the girl's hands! Robbery!

253
00:36:38,563 --> 00:36:40,428
Give it back to her.

254
00:36:41,165 --> 00:36:45,067
I want to talk to you.
Give him some jaggery.

255
00:36:45,803 --> 00:36:47,794
Here. Come in.

256
00:36:50,641 --> 00:36:54,634
There's a month or so before
the crop can be harvested.

257
00:36:54,879 --> 00:36:58,713
I wanted a quintal of jowar.
There's nothing to eat at home.

258
00:36:58,883 --> 00:37:01,044
So you eat me.

259
00:37:01,786 --> 00:37:04,186
I swear I'm fed up
of giving you loans.

260
00:37:04,422 --> 00:37:06,890
No sign of paying back
what you've already taken.

261
00:37:07,058 --> 00:37:09,049
Don't you take 3 parts of our crop?

262
00:37:09,227 --> 00:37:13,129
That's the interest.
The principal is as it is.

263
00:37:13,831 --> 00:37:15,992
Should our kids starve to death?

264
00:37:16,400 --> 00:37:20,962
Let not the kids starve.
What have you brought to pawn?

265
00:37:21,639 --> 00:37:25,302
To pawn? Don't you trust me?

266
00:37:25,810 --> 00:37:31,749
It's not that. If you ask for
a kilo or so I won't think twice.

267
00:37:32,183 --> 00:37:36,813
But a quintal! Don't feel hurt
but I'm sitting here for business.

268
00:37:37,188 --> 00:37:39,918
I have a motherless child to rear.

269
00:37:40,157 --> 00:37:42,489
I have to collect money for her.

270
00:37:42,727 --> 00:37:45,594
If nothing else, your
daughter-in-law has ornaments.

271
00:37:45,830 --> 00:37:48,458
- Don't you dare talk of her!
- All right. I won't.

272
00:37:49,033 --> 00:37:51,433
You have some copper
and bronze vessels?

273
00:37:51,669 --> 00:37:55,127
- Yes!
- Then get them.

274
00:37:55,373 --> 00:37:58,035
Tell your mother
to give the vessels.

275
00:37:58,276 --> 00:38:00,403
To throw at his face!

276
00:38:01,912 --> 00:38:04,710
I won't give them! He's a thief!

277
00:38:04,882 --> 00:38:07,510
I won't give them! He's a thief!

278
00:38:12,023 --> 00:38:14,958
In what will we cook?
And store water?

279
00:38:16,727 --> 00:38:22,597
He says he'll give the grain
only if we give our vessels.

280
00:38:22,867 --> 00:38:25,927
- Give it.
- I don't want his grain!

281
00:38:26,370 --> 00:38:28,930
- Give it son.
- I won't! It's my plate!

282
00:38:31,242 --> 00:38:35,372
If you don't give this plate,
your father will sleep hungry.

283
00:38:36,681 --> 00:38:38,979
Ramu will be hungry.

284
00:38:40,251 --> 00:38:42,446
Your grandma will be hungry.

285
00:38:49,760 --> 00:38:53,127
My mother will also starve.

286
00:38:53,931 --> 00:38:58,425
Will you also starve?

287
00:39:00,638 --> 00:39:03,630
I don't want it.

288
00:39:38,642 --> 00:39:40,610
Come down and have lunch.

289
00:39:40,678 --> 00:39:43,340
- I don't want it. You eat.
- Got a little late.

290
00:39:43,547 --> 00:39:44,707
The fire wouldn't light.

291
00:39:44,882 --> 00:39:48,283
- Begged for grain?
- No, don't say that.

292
00:39:48,753 --> 00:39:51,688
Why not? I say you shouldn't
have brought food today!

293
00:39:52,490 --> 00:39:55,687
- You would have been hungry.
- So what? God would feel ashamed.

294
00:39:56,060 --> 00:39:58,255
Gives us birth but doesn't feed us!

295
00:39:58,496 --> 00:40:00,896
Eat something.

296
00:40:02,433 --> 00:40:05,300
So the vessels have
reached the money lender!

297
00:40:06,370 --> 00:40:10,238
I have thought of a plan.
We have 5 acres of land...

298
00:40:10,474 --> 00:40:13,102
It's lying barren with only grass.

299
00:40:13,310 --> 00:40:16,541
We'll cultivate it.
The money lender doesn't own it.

300
00:40:16,714 --> 00:40:18,511
Is it easy to break that land?

301
00:40:18,716 --> 00:40:21,583
Half the land is full of stones
and the other half with thick roots!

302
00:40:21,919 --> 00:40:24,149
My oxen will die in 2 days.

303
00:40:24,688 --> 00:40:28,419
The oxen will die later.
First the moneylender will kill us.

304
00:40:28,592 --> 00:40:31,390
I'll start breaking the land
right from tomorrow.

305
00:41:12,002 --> 00:41:15,529
I had told you this land
is only full of boulders!

306
00:42:12,496 --> 00:42:14,623
You are so broken hearted
just because an ox died?

307
00:42:14,798 --> 00:42:18,199
I'm not dead. I can
always lend you 100 bucks.

308
00:42:18,402 --> 00:42:24,272
I believe if man can't help
another, I'd rather shoot him!

309
00:42:25,543 --> 00:42:27,340
- Aunt!
- You be quiet mother!

310
00:42:27,545 --> 00:42:31,538
- If you don't leave, you've had it.
- What crime have I committed?

311
00:42:31,749 --> 00:42:33,717
Am I a thief? A dacoit?

312
00:42:35,553 --> 00:42:37,418
Leave him!

313
00:42:37,621 --> 00:42:40,886
- He will die!
- Let him!

314
00:42:41,692 --> 00:42:44,456
Let him go!

315
00:42:48,966 --> 00:42:50,831
He's killed me!

316
00:42:51,302 --> 00:42:53,668
Thank God nobody saw.

317
00:42:55,239 --> 00:42:59,141
Be prepared for tomorrow. I'll
confiscate your field, house, ox...

318
00:43:00,377 --> 00:43:02,971
Then call me a sweeper
not a money lender!

319
00:43:03,180 --> 00:43:05,614
I'll strip the clothes
off your back!

320
00:43:05,916 --> 00:43:08,714
- Give me my turban!
- Your father is a rat!

321
00:43:11,755 --> 00:43:13,655
Return my turban! You rat!

322
00:43:13,857 --> 00:43:15,586
- Give it back!
- You rat!

323
00:43:19,229 --> 00:43:22,528
- Return it.
- I won't!

324
00:43:26,937 --> 00:43:30,839
Doesn't matter. Are you watching?

325
00:43:32,476 --> 00:43:35,502
I'm taking this as a remembrance.

326
00:43:36,046 --> 00:43:38,378
I say, murderer!

327
00:43:38,549 --> 00:43:42,110
If you treat him like this,
how will we survive?

328
00:43:42,319 --> 00:43:44,753
- He's no God!
- Not God?

329
00:43:44,955 --> 00:43:47,719
Then ask your God for another ox.

330
00:43:48,459 --> 00:43:50,484
With what face can I
now ask him for money?

331
00:43:50,894 --> 00:43:54,921
Why do you need to beg for money?
Let everyone die like the ox died!

332
00:43:55,399 --> 00:43:58,562
Let everyone die!
You are very arrogant!

333
00:43:58,869 --> 00:44:01,736
- We eat thanks to him!
- I'll burn such food!

334
00:44:02,106 --> 00:44:04,233
- No!
- Move aside!

335
00:44:06,110 --> 00:44:07,975
- Leave it!
- My kids are hungry!

336
00:44:11,215 --> 00:44:13,206
My children are hungry!

337
00:45:30,227 --> 00:45:32,889
Get an ox with this.

338
00:46:38,195 --> 00:46:39,685
Well done.

339
00:46:39,863 --> 00:46:45,733
Good Radha. Almost done.

340
00:46:54,611 --> 00:46:57,205
A little more.

341
00:47:00,317 --> 00:47:03,514
Shambhu! Uncle!

342
00:47:03,687 --> 00:47:06,451
Help! Uncle!

343
00:47:09,359 --> 00:47:12,851
Anybody there?

344
00:47:56,540 --> 00:47:58,940
It would have been
better if I had died!

345
00:47:59,443 --> 00:48:02,606
- God forbid!
- I should've died!

346
00:48:04,414 --> 00:48:08,077
What's the point in such a life?

347
00:48:09,253 --> 00:48:13,713
I will tolerate the harshest
sunlight in your shadow.

348
00:48:14,157 --> 00:48:16,990
For God's sake don't say that!

349
00:48:23,767 --> 00:48:25,564
Smoke mine father.

350
00:48:32,509 --> 00:48:37,378
Smoking? Kids don't smoke.

351
00:48:37,614 --> 00:48:41,550
- You must not smoke.
- I'll never smoke Dad.

352
00:48:42,386 --> 00:48:46,755
Here you smoke.

353
00:48:47,591 --> 00:48:49,821
I'll roll joints for you.

354
00:48:50,060 --> 00:48:52,460
And you smoke. No problem.

355
00:48:52,696 --> 00:48:56,063
- Daughter-in-law!
- Wait. I'm coming.

356
00:48:56,800 --> 00:48:59,132
- Call your mother.
- Mother!

357
00:48:59,303 --> 00:49:01,498
Mother, I'll help you...

358
00:49:10,080 --> 00:49:12,605
Mother!

359
00:49:29,032 --> 00:49:31,330
Good God!

360
00:49:31,568 --> 00:49:35,265
Why are you giving the oxen
this dirty water to drink?

361
00:49:35,739 --> 00:49:37,866
Take the oxen to our well.

362
00:49:39,443 --> 00:49:42,537
No. Don't do this.

363
00:49:43,046 --> 00:49:45,037
Why not?

364
00:49:45,615 --> 00:49:48,083
What will you do with them?

365
00:49:48,285 --> 00:49:50,549
You'll have to sell them.

366
00:49:50,988 --> 00:49:54,583
Was my money worthless...?

367
00:49:56,393 --> 00:50:00,159
You'll never be happy.

368
00:50:00,697 --> 00:50:03,723
Don't take curses from my kids.

369
00:50:03,934 --> 00:50:05,663
I have no arms.

370
00:50:08,171 --> 00:50:10,833
No hands and no shame!

371
00:50:11,074 --> 00:50:14,942
Kids are starving and
you live off your wife!

372
00:50:16,713 --> 00:50:20,342
Shameless! Darken your face and
sit on the village outskirts.

373
00:50:20,550 --> 00:50:24,008
Live off charity like a stray dog!

374
00:50:24,354 --> 00:50:26,914
Take the oxen!

375
00:50:27,524 --> 00:50:32,018
I won't let you take them! No!

376
00:50:34,231 --> 00:50:36,529
Tie a bell round my neck!

377
00:50:36,800 --> 00:50:40,634
And turn me into an ox.
Oh! I forgot...

378
00:50:40,837 --> 00:50:43,032
Tie this in his neck.

379
00:51:07,097 --> 00:51:10,225
Give this too to the money lender.

380
00:51:51,441 --> 00:51:54,569
You have no hands and no shame.

381
00:51:54,778 --> 00:51:58,475
The kids are starving and
you live off your wife!

382
00:52:01,985 --> 00:52:07,013
If you must live, live on charity.

383
00:54:03,139 --> 00:54:06,040
Mother!

384
00:54:07,310 --> 00:54:09,437
I knew it!

385
00:54:09,646 --> 00:54:13,377
- What did you know?
- I knew he wouldn't take it.

386
00:54:13,650 --> 00:54:17,017
I knew it! I knew it would happen!

387
00:54:17,220 --> 00:54:19,552
Daughter-in-law!

388
00:54:20,423 --> 00:54:23,290
Your vermilion!

389
00:54:24,361 --> 00:54:27,091
No mother!

390
00:54:46,182 --> 00:54:48,275
Mother!

391
00:54:48,718 --> 00:54:51,687
Mother!

392
00:55:37,801 --> 00:55:45,264
Mother what's wrong?
Didn't find Dad?

393
00:55:47,644 --> 00:55:50,670
Where has Dad gone?

394
00:55:51,281 --> 00:55:53,613
He got angry with me and left.

395
00:55:53,783 --> 00:55:56,684
Why? Got angry and left?

396
00:55:56,853 --> 00:56:00,721
But why are you crying?

397
00:56:02,559 --> 00:56:04,584
Shall I tell you something?

398
00:56:06,129 --> 00:56:10,725
He has no hands.
Who will feed him?

399
00:56:11,234 --> 00:56:16,331
- That's why I'm crying.
- You're crying.

400
00:56:19,709 --> 00:56:22,906
Let's go home.

401
00:59:54,357 --> 00:59:57,053
Grandma! Grandma!

402
00:59:57,794 --> 01:00:02,561
Grandma! Get up!

403
01:00:03,199 --> 01:00:04,757
Get up grandma!

404
01:00:04,934 --> 01:00:06,526
Or I'll get water!

405
01:00:06,736 --> 01:00:10,137
Okay I'll get water!

406
01:00:10,406 --> 01:00:13,898
I'll throw water at you.

407
01:00:23,553 --> 01:00:28,115
- Let her be.
- I'll call mother.

408
01:00:28,791 --> 01:00:31,726
Mother, grandma is sleeping tight.

409
01:00:48,111 --> 01:00:51,239
Mother, you're feeding others
with sweets and starving us!

410
01:00:52,782 --> 01:00:55,683
Feed the dead and
starve the living to death!

411
01:00:56,285 --> 01:00:58,446
This is life.

412
01:01:00,189 --> 01:01:01,781
Open the door!

413
01:01:02,025 --> 01:01:03,617
Open the door!

414
01:01:03,960 --> 01:01:08,124
Mother open the door!

415
01:01:30,420 --> 01:01:33,947
Dear Radha!

416
01:01:34,123 --> 01:01:38,685
Shame on you! You took
20 acres of land, the oxen!

417
01:01:38,761 --> 01:01:40,752
Now have you come for the corpses?

418
01:01:41,030 --> 01:01:43,590
You have your eyes set
on the 5 acres that remain!

419
01:01:43,866 --> 01:01:47,393
You'll die a dog's death!

420
01:01:47,704 --> 01:01:52,073
Doesn't matter. Even the
dog is a creation of God.

421
01:01:52,842 --> 01:01:54,707
- What do you want?
- Money.

422
01:01:54,977 --> 01:01:58,378
- She has no money to die!
- I'm ready to look after them all.

423
01:01:58,781 --> 01:02:01,011
Try to understand me.

424
01:02:02,985 --> 01:02:07,649
Explain to her that her
husband ditched her and left.

425
01:02:07,957 --> 01:02:11,757
I'm still alive
I'll look after everything.

426
01:02:12,128 --> 01:02:17,498
Take back the land, the oxen.
And we'll see about the loan too.

427
01:02:19,969 --> 01:02:22,369
Mother, my ox has returned!

428
01:02:26,676 --> 01:02:28,200
Will you leave me and go?

429
01:02:28,411 --> 01:02:32,905
Now if you go, I won't
talk to you ever!

430
01:02:33,316 --> 01:02:34,977
I'll never speak to you!

431
01:02:35,518 --> 01:02:37,850
You won't go.

432
01:02:38,621 --> 01:02:42,921
I won't talk if you go.

433
01:02:43,392 --> 01:02:45,326
Come here.

434
01:02:45,495 --> 01:02:52,628
- I won't.
- Son, take the ox out.

435
01:02:59,976 --> 01:03:05,778
Fine. Just as you have returned
the oxen, return the loan too.

436
01:03:06,182 --> 01:03:09,083
If you don't like my deal,
forget it.

437
01:03:16,259 --> 01:03:21,663
Radha is not for sale.
She'll die but not sell herself.

438
01:03:24,567 --> 01:03:28,799
She can be sold only for her kids.

439
01:03:29,505 --> 01:03:32,030
Take your share when
the crop is harvested.

440
01:03:32,208 --> 01:03:34,233
Now go away.

441
01:07:50,499 --> 01:07:52,990
God! Now what will happen?

442
01:07:53,202 --> 01:07:56,797
The crop is almost ready. If it
rains now, there'll be a famine.

443
01:08:16,292 --> 01:08:18,920
God! We don't want water!

444
01:08:28,404 --> 01:08:30,804
Hold me!

445
01:08:31,073 --> 01:08:34,236
Help!

446
01:09:38,240 --> 01:09:41,676
Mother! A snake!

447
01:09:51,754 --> 01:09:54,188
Throw it Birju!

448
01:09:58,961 --> 01:10:01,623
Go away from my mother!

449
01:10:06,569 --> 01:10:08,935
Mother I'm very hungry.

450
01:10:09,138 --> 01:10:11,902
- Give me some food.
- In a minute.

451
01:10:12,107 --> 01:10:14,302
I'll light a blazing fire.

452
01:10:18,280 --> 01:10:23,513
Mother, baby is not getting up.

453
01:10:38,334 --> 01:10:41,201
Radha my queen.

454
01:10:41,470 --> 01:10:46,703
You had called me over.
So I've come for my share.

455
01:10:46,976 --> 01:10:51,174
If I wouldn't come now,
you'd say I didn't come.

456
01:10:54,049 --> 01:10:57,815
Lord! Killed him finally?

457
01:11:01,056 --> 01:11:04,617
Swear by God, I feel very sorry.

458
01:11:04,927 --> 01:11:06,861
Son will you have some grams?

459
01:11:07,062 --> 01:11:10,896
I won't have that.
I'll eat what mother is cooking.

460
01:11:17,039 --> 01:11:19,473
Mother, I'm starving.

461
01:11:19,908 --> 01:11:22,399
Very hungry.

462
01:11:26,482 --> 01:11:28,109
There's nothing in this.

463
01:11:28,317 --> 01:11:30,342
The food is cooked son.

464
01:11:31,053 --> 01:11:35,683
Lord! Why are you doing this?

465
01:11:36,392 --> 01:11:39,555
What to do? I'm so soft
I can't bear to see this!

466
01:11:39,795 --> 01:11:42,263
Eat this son.

467
01:11:44,033 --> 01:11:48,595
Throw it away. Throw it!

468
01:11:48,771 --> 01:11:51,262
What kind of mother are you?

469
01:11:52,074 --> 01:11:53,974
Eat it son.

470
01:11:54,910 --> 01:11:57,140
In that hand too.

471
01:11:59,815 --> 01:12:04,980
Throw it. Throw it!

472
01:12:06,789 --> 01:12:11,283
Do you want me or the grams?

473
01:12:21,537 --> 01:12:25,974
Mother and son, just the same!

474
01:12:27,643 --> 01:12:30,441
By morning you'll come
to your senses.

475
01:12:33,182 --> 01:12:37,846
I'm a very patient man.

476
01:12:38,087 --> 01:12:45,425
When your anger cools down,
think over my proposal again.

477
01:12:52,334 --> 01:12:56,168
Son! Birju!

478
01:13:22,831 --> 01:13:26,426
Look at me!

479
01:13:31,407 --> 01:13:34,001
Nothing will happen to my son.

480
01:13:34,176 --> 01:13:35,837
Mother!

481
01:13:35,978 --> 01:13:39,709
Yes, I'll give you the grams.

482
01:13:47,055 --> 01:13:51,788
Hungry... grams...

483
01:14:06,775 --> 01:14:09,175
I'll get them for you.

484
01:14:13,382 --> 01:14:20,720
Mother, hungry... grams...

485
01:14:25,761 --> 01:14:28,252
Bless you lady.

486
01:14:28,464 --> 01:14:31,058
Radha the queen at my step?

487
01:14:31,300 --> 01:14:34,599
I am blessed. Come in.

488
01:14:34,770 --> 01:14:37,330
Come in.

489
01:14:48,884 --> 01:14:50,579
My children are starving.

490
01:14:50,686 --> 01:14:52,483
Give me food.

491
01:14:52,654 --> 01:14:59,492
Give me food. My kids are hungry.

492
01:14:59,728 --> 01:15:02,253
Understood.

493
01:15:09,137 --> 01:15:12,629
I'll cover my queen in gold.

494
01:15:15,310 --> 01:15:20,111
Don't worry my queen. Who holds the
generous man's hand will be happy.

495
01:15:20,782 --> 01:15:26,379
Even if I keep a dog,
it will wear a gold chain.

496
01:15:28,790 --> 01:15:33,022
Swear by God, you look
like the goddess of wealth.

497
01:15:34,329 --> 01:15:39,460
- Come.
- I'll look like a goddess?

498
01:15:41,236 --> 01:15:44,865
Didn't you feel ashamed
to come in this form?

499
01:15:45,073 --> 01:15:49,009
If you've come in my form,
keep your image intact.

500
01:15:49,878 --> 01:15:52,574
Don't laugh.

501
01:15:55,250 --> 01:15:59,277
The goddess who carries
the burden of the world.

502
01:15:59,521 --> 01:16:02,115
You won't be able to carry
the burden of motherhood.

503
01:16:02,357 --> 01:16:07,454
Try and become a mother.
You'll give up in 2 steps

504
01:16:08,163 --> 01:16:10,427
- She won't go from here.
- Don't you dare!

505
01:16:11,667 --> 01:16:13,726
- Let go of her.
- Don't touch it!

506
01:16:13,936 --> 01:16:17,463
She has given you wealth and
brought me here in poverty.

507
01:16:18,373 --> 01:16:22,901
I want to show her
it's easy to preach

508
01:16:23,178 --> 01:16:25,373
But very difficult to follow.

509
01:16:25,881 --> 01:16:28,213
It's easy to watch the fun.

510
01:16:28,784 --> 01:16:32,083
But very difficult to
lead life as in a play.

511
01:16:32,988 --> 01:16:34,956
Very difficult.

512
01:16:35,524 --> 01:16:41,827
See what a helpless mother
can do for her children!

513
01:16:42,297 --> 01:16:44,595
To what depths she can sink!

514
01:16:47,302 --> 01:16:50,499
She cannot give strength.

515
01:16:50,973 --> 01:16:54,101
Then take away my shame!

516
01:16:54,576 --> 01:16:59,206
I can't sacrifice my children!

517
01:17:18,767 --> 01:17:22,601
He will return. He is alive.

518
01:17:22,804 --> 01:17:24,863
This won't remain.

519
01:17:26,608 --> 01:17:29,543
A woman's duty is motherhood.

520
01:17:31,480 --> 01:17:34,381
Thank God you came to me.

521
01:17:34,583 --> 01:17:37,017
Otherwise your sweet kids
would die.

522
01:17:37,219 --> 01:17:41,451
- Come.
- Let go!

523
01:17:43,258 --> 01:17:50,528
The goddess has returned my husband
She will also return my children.

524
01:17:51,466 --> 01:17:55,493
- She will.
- Yes she will.

525
01:17:55,837 --> 01:17:58,328
She'll return your husband and kids.

526
01:17:58,540 --> 01:18:00,303
But at my hands!

527
01:18:22,698 --> 01:18:25,633
Help me!

528
01:18:58,767 --> 01:19:02,259
Won't you leave?
The entire village is going.

529
01:19:02,471 --> 01:19:05,531
- I won't go.
- You want to starve here?

530
01:19:06,274 --> 01:19:08,538
Nothing can be done in
this field for 2 years.

531
01:26:44,265 --> 01:26:47,894
You've changed the
face of the village

532
01:26:48,403 --> 01:26:53,466
Honestly I've neither seen
nor heard of such a crop!

533
01:26:53,708 --> 01:26:59,146
Feels as if the crop has
fallen from heaven not earth.

534
01:26:59,781 --> 01:27:03,683
Don't worry. Your share of
3 parts has been kept aside.

535
01:27:04,052 --> 01:27:05,713
Go and take it.

536
01:27:07,388 --> 01:27:09,652
- Yes master?
- Fill the carts.

537
01:27:14,796 --> 01:27:17,492
How are you my son?

538
01:27:18,466 --> 01:27:21,663
Get up son. This is my share.

539
01:27:22,170 --> 01:27:28,075
First show me the account.
Then look at my crop.

540
01:27:29,043 --> 01:27:34,071
So you want to see the account?

541
01:27:34,515 --> 01:27:38,474
Have I fallen on such times
that I have to show you accounts?

542
01:27:39,487 --> 01:27:43,617
Hear! He wants to see my books.

543
01:27:44,592 --> 01:27:49,359
Your father never looked at
my books, what will you do?

544
01:27:50,398 --> 01:27:53,561
The son will see
the father's account

545
01:27:53,768 --> 01:27:57,204
Show him the account.

546
01:27:58,539 --> 01:28:01,064
Move away.

547
01:28:07,081 --> 01:28:09,345
What are you doing?
Aren't you ashamed?

548
01:28:09,550 --> 01:28:11,415
I've grown old filling your house!

549
01:28:11,753 --> 01:28:14,449
And for this grain, you're
aiming a gun at my son!

550
01:28:15,223 --> 01:28:17,783
10 such crops sacrificed
for my son!

551
01:28:18,293 --> 01:28:20,158
Take it away! We don't want it!

552
01:28:20,528 --> 01:28:23,986
Did I ask you to shoot?
Join an army if you want to shoot!

553
01:28:24,632 --> 01:28:28,159
Why do you need guns?
I asked to show the account.

554
01:28:29,437 --> 01:28:32,099
Take the grain. You don't do
the job you've come for! Shooting!

555
01:28:32,740 --> 01:28:34,571
What are you waiting for?

556
01:28:36,811 --> 01:28:40,247
I won't let him take one grain!

557
01:28:43,084 --> 01:28:45,450
We'll have to give it if it's due.

558
01:28:46,921 --> 01:28:50,152
- Take your share!
- Live long son.

559
01:28:50,325 --> 01:28:53,624
Don't just stare. Lift it!

560
01:28:58,566 --> 01:29:03,469
- Drop this!
- Mother!

561
01:29:04,305 --> 01:29:07,035
I won't let him take the crop.

562
01:29:08,176 --> 01:29:10,736
We've plowed the land like oxen.

563
01:29:10,912 --> 01:29:14,541
It contains our sweat.
We stayed hungry for it

564
01:29:15,683 --> 01:29:20,177
If this grain won't feed us,
I'll burn it up!

565
01:29:22,192 --> 01:29:26,219
Then ask him to show me the account.

566
01:29:26,463 --> 01:29:29,330
You want to see the books.
Here have a look.

567
01:29:30,935 --> 01:29:33,768
Here study it.

568
01:29:35,139 --> 01:29:37,903
Read it my son.

569
01:29:45,482 --> 01:29:47,712
You read it mother.

570
01:29:54,024 --> 01:29:57,425
Ask somebody else to read it.

571
01:30:00,197 --> 01:30:04,497
- You read it!
- Read it. Don't feel shy.

572
01:30:04,768 --> 01:30:07,601
He can't understand accounts.
You read and explain it to him.

573
01:30:07,771 --> 01:30:11,070
- You read it uncle.
- This is knowledge.

574
01:30:11,275 --> 01:30:14,403
If we could read,
we wouldn't see this day.

575
01:30:15,479 --> 01:30:17,709
Then you signed it without reading?

576
01:30:18,148 --> 01:30:20,548
Your grandma signed it!
