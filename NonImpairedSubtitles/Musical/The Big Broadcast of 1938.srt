my fault!

734
00:58:59,027 --> 00:59:00,961
Oh, boy!

735
00:59:02,865 --> 00:59:06,232
Ah, here's where
we make a couple of
very dear friendships.

736
00:59:06,301 --> 00:59:08,997
That is glass.
Ah, it's too clean.

737
00:59:09,071 --> 00:59:11,005
Be very careful of that--
[ Cane Banging ]

738
00:59:11,073 --> 00:59:13,940
Look out.
How do you do.
Garcon!

739
00:59:14,009 --> 00:59:16,876
<i>[ Waiter ]</i>
<i>Yes, sir?</i>
Bring us two whiskey sodas.

740
00:59:16,945 --> 00:59:19,311
<i>Yes, sir.</i>
Spoke to him
in his native tongue.

741
00:59:19,381 --> 00:59:22,077
Move over, dear.
That's all right.
I like that.

742
00:59:22,150 --> 00:59:26,018
Oh, do you? That's fine.
Make it four whiskey sodas.

743
00:59:26,088 --> 00:59:28,113
Don't put your hat
on the table.

744
00:59:28,190 --> 00:59:30,124
As I was saying,
Yes?

745
00:59:30,192 --> 00:59:33,320
I was married to him
for eight months. I gave him
the best years of my life.

746
00:59:33,395 --> 00:59:35,829
Best years of her life.
I only wanted
a million dollars.

747
00:59:35,898 --> 00:59:37,991
Only a million.
He wouldn't
give me a penny.

748
00:59:38,066 --> 00:59:40,091
Where was your mother?

749
00:59:40,168 --> 00:59:43,035
Couldn't come that day,
I suppose.
But he'll pay,

750
00:59:43,105 --> 00:59:46,199
and he'll pay
through his nose.
Ha ha! Good.

751
00:59:46,275 --> 00:59:48,835
They seem
a bit snooty.
Very silly little girls.

752
00:59:48,911 --> 00:59:51,106
They let it slip
right through their fingers.

753
00:59:51,179 --> 00:59:54,376
Well, we'll be going.
We'll see you later.

754
00:59:54,449 --> 00:59:58,112
Is that a tomato he's eating,
or is that his nose?

755
00:59:58,186 --> 01:00:00,211
Evidently,
they're insulted.

756
01:00:00,289 --> 01:00:03,622
- You say anything to them?
- I never opened my mouth.

757
01:00:03,692 --> 01:00:06,923
I've lost my hat.
There it is, up there.

758
01:00:06,995 --> 01:00:09,259
Where? Ah.

759
01:00:09,331 --> 01:00:11,697
I told you
I lost it. Oh.

760
01:00:12,668 --> 01:00:15,228
Good-bye!
Good-bye, dear.

761
01:00:15,304 --> 01:00:19,240
There it goes.
Here, give me that.
You got a hat of your own.

762
01:00:22,344 --> 01:00:24,403
What's the matter,
darling?

763
01:00:24,479 --> 01:00:28,381
Hello, Cleo.
What's the matter?

764
01:00:28,450 --> 01:00:31,977
Little man had
a busy day?
This is no time
for wisecracks,

765
01:00:32,054 --> 01:00:33,954
from you
or anyone else.

766
01:00:34,022 --> 01:00:38,356
$50,000.
<i>Well, what's</i>
<i>$50,000?</i>

767
01:00:38,427 --> 01:00:43,262
Ahh, I'm goin' out
and eat worms, with
salt and pepper and stuff.

768
01:00:43,332 --> 01:00:46,096
Oh, wait a minute.
Thank you.

769
01:00:46,168 --> 01:00:49,262
<i>Say, keep them coming,</i>
<i>and give her the cherries,</i>
<i>will you?</i>

770
01:00:49,338 --> 01:00:54,275
Thanks for remembering.
Say, make that extra big
so I can catch up with him.

771
01:00:54,343 --> 01:00:57,369
You know, Buzz,
I cleaned up
an old trunk yesterday,

772
01:00:57,446 --> 01:01:01,075
and I found
that green tie of yours,
the one with the stripes.

773
01:01:01,149 --> 01:01:04,346
Really?
<i>Uh-huh.</i>

774
01:01:04,419 --> 01:01:07,411
You know something, Buzz?
<i>What, dear?</i>

775
01:01:08,824 --> 01:01:11,884
I kind of miss
your singing in the bathtub.

776
01:01:11,960 --> 01:01:15,418
Mm, good old bathtub.

777
01:01:15,497 --> 01:01:17,431
Good old singing.

778
01:01:23,071 --> 01:01:28,600
Thanks for the memory
of rainy afternoons

779
01:01:28,677 --> 01:01:31,111
Swingy Harlem tunes

780
01:01:31,179 --> 01:01:35,741
Motor trips and burning lips
and burning toast and prunes

781
01:01:35,817 --> 01:01:38,581
How lovely it was

782
01:01:40,522 --> 01:01:44,219
Thanks for the memory

783
01:01:44,292 --> 01:01:48,592
Of candlelight and wine
castles on the Rhine

784
01:01:48,663 --> 01:01:54,067
The Parthenon
And moments on
the Hudson River line

785
01:01:54,136 --> 01:01:56,570
How lovely it was

786
01:01:58,473 --> 01:02:02,000
Many's the time
that we feasted

787
01:02:02,077 --> 01:02:05,569
And many's the time
that we fasted

788
01:02:07,349 --> 01:02:10,113
Oh well it was swell
while it lasted

789
01:02:11,820 --> 01:02:15,779
We did have fun
and no harm done

790
01:02:18,160 --> 01:02:23,996
<i>So thanks for the memory</i>
<i>of crap games on the floor</i>

791
01:02:24,066 --> 01:02:26,591
Nights in Singapore

792
01:02:26,668 --> 01:02:30,195
You might've been a headache
but you never were a bore

793
01:02:31,673 --> 01:02:34,141
I thank you so much

794
01:02:36,044 --> 01:02:41,949
Thanks for the memory
of China's funny wall

795
01:02:42,017 --> 01:02:44,212
Transatlantic calls

796
01:02:44,286 --> 01:02:48,620
That weekend at Niagara
when we hardly saw the falls

797
01:02:51,093 --> 01:02:53,584
- How lovely that was.
- Thank you.

798
01:02:55,297 --> 01:03:00,360
Thanks for the memory
of lunch from 1 2:00 to 4:00

799
01:03:00,435 --> 01:03:03,029
Sunburn at the shore

800
01:03:03,105 --> 01:03:07,064
That pair of gay pajamas that
you bought and never wore

801
01:03:08,410 --> 01:03:11,243
Say, by the way,
what did happen
to those pajamas?

802
01:03:11,313 --> 01:03:13,781
<i>Huh?</i>

803
01:03:13,849 --> 01:03:16,818
Letters with
sweet little secrets

804
01:03:16,885 --> 01:03:21,652
That couldn't be put
in a day wire

805
01:03:21,723 --> 01:03:24,920
Too bad it all
had to go haywire

806
01:03:26,461 --> 01:03:28,429
That's life, I guess

807
01:03:28,497 --> 01:03:31,591
I love...
your dress

808
01:03:32,734 --> 01:03:34,668
Do you?
It's pretty.

809
01:03:34,736 --> 01:03:37,136
Thanks...
For the memory

810
01:03:37,205 --> 01:03:42,040
Of faults that you forgave
Rainbows on a wave

811
01:03:42,110 --> 01:03:46,843
And stockings in the basin
when a fellow needs a shave

812
01:03:47,916 --> 01:03:50,043
I thank you
so much

813
01:03:52,320 --> 01:03:55,517
Thanks for the memory

814
01:03:55,590 --> 01:03:58,491
Of gardens at Versailles

815
01:03:58,560 --> 01:04:00,653
And beef and kidney pie

816
01:04:00,729 --> 01:04:05,632
The night you worked
and then came home with
lipstick on your tie

817
01:04:07,736 --> 01:04:10,364
How lovely that was.
Huh?

818
01:04:12,140 --> 01:04:16,577
For the memory
of lingerie with lace

819
01:04:16,645 --> 01:04:19,443
Yes and pilsner
by the case

820
01:04:19,514 --> 01:04:23,746
And how I jumped
the day you trumped
my one and only ace

821
01:04:24,886 --> 01:04:27,582
How lou--
lovely that was

822
01:04:30,125 --> 01:04:32,992
We said good-bye
with a highball

823
01:04:33,061 --> 01:04:36,963
Then I got as high
as a steeple

824
01:04:37,032 --> 01:04:41,230
Did you?
But we were
intelligent people

825
01:04:42,804 --> 01:04:44,772
No tears, no fuss

826
01:04:46,441 --> 01:04:48,568
Hurray for us

827
01:04:54,816 --> 01:04:58,684
Strictly <i>entre-nous</i>
Darling, how are you?

828
01:04:58,753 --> 01:05:04,055
And how are all
the little dreams that
never did come true

829
01:05:05,660 --> 01:05:07,594
Awfully glad I met you

830
01:05:09,030 --> 01:05:11,225
Cheerio and toodle-oo

831
01:05:14,903 --> 01:05:16,837
Thank you.

832
01:05:18,406 --> 01:05:20,340
Thank you.

833
01:05:21,810 --> 01:05:23,869
Oh, Buzz! Buzz!

834
01:05:23,945 --> 01:05:26,709
Darling.
I know.

835
01:05:26,781 --> 01:05:28,715
I know, dear.

836
01:05:34,456 --> 01:05:38,324
Now what does that mean?
That means Robert Hayes'
invention's a failure.

837
01:05:38,393 --> 01:05:42,124
Oh, I wish I could be
of some help.
Stumped by a short circuit.

838
01:05:42,197 --> 01:05:45,826
Come on, Bob, it isn't
hopeless, is it?
No, no, it's not hopeless.

839
01:05:45,900 --> 01:05:47,834
But that'll take
a month to find.

840
01:05:47,902 --> 01:05:51,702
By that time, the trip
will be over and so will what
I laughingly call my career.

841
01:05:51,773 --> 01:05:55,300
Poor Bob.
Oh, excuse me. I thought
I was someplace else.

842
01:05:55,377 --> 01:05:59,313
Well, so long.
Just remember
where you left off.

843
01:05:59,381 --> 01:06:01,611
<i>Hey! Hey, come back here!</i>

844
01:06:01,683 --> 01:06:04,675
Come on!
There you go.

845
01:06:04,753 --> 01:06:07,449
Do you mind if I
sort of pass through?

846
01:06:07,522 --> 01:06:12,323
I thought this was
a thing that went around
the whole thing up there,

847
01:06:12,394 --> 01:06:14,589
and it came--
I just wan-- ooh!

848
01:06:14,663 --> 01:06:17,632
I, I guess I must've
busted somethin', huh?

849
01:06:17,699 --> 01:06:21,260
Well, how much will it cost
to have fixed?
My dream girl! Eureka!

850
01:06:21,336 --> 01:06:24,032
Hey, I resent that.
My dream princess!

851
01:06:24,105 --> 01:06:26,437
Whoo! Your nose is cold.

852
01:06:26,508 --> 01:06:28,442
What is it?
The tip of
Bellows' umbrella.

853
01:06:28,510 --> 01:06:31,479
- The short circuit I couldn't locate.
- What's all the kissin' about?

854
01:06:31,546 --> 01:06:33,980
<i>Don't you understand? You</i>
<i>found the tip of the umbrella.</i>

855
01:06:34,049 --> 01:06:37,780
I, I-- Whoo!
I'll be right back.
<i>Where you going?</i>

856
01:06:37,852 --> 01:06:40,821
I'm gonna get
more umbrellas.
Boy, oh boy!

857
01:06:42,757 --> 01:06:44,884
Hey!
<i>[ Martha ]</i>
<i>I'll be right back.</i>

858
01:06:44,959 --> 01:06:49,521
You think it'll
start now?
I don't know.
We can try.

859
01:06:52,233 --> 01:06:55,259
Cross your fingers.

860
01:06:55,337 --> 01:06:57,999
<i>[ Hayes ]</i>
<i>Oh, that's great!</i>
<i>[ Dorothy ] Oh, Bob!</i>

861
01:07:07,415 --> 01:07:10,578
Although I am a veritable
tyro at the game,

862
01:07:10,652 --> 01:07:13,519
I will make an exception
in your case and make
a small wager.

863
01:07:13,588 --> 01:07:16,682
Right, sir.
Any amount?
Ah, that's a bet.

864
01:07:16,758 --> 01:07:21,491
Yes, but, uh, how much?
Shall we say a pound?
Make it a ton.

865
01:07:23,698 --> 01:07:27,600
Ah, there's too much
loft on that cue.
Go ahead. You shoot.

866
01:07:29,471 --> 01:07:32,838
Imagine a man wearing
a roller towel for a hat.

867
01:07:32,907 --> 01:07:35,034
Got a little soap
in your pocket?

868
01:07:35,110 --> 01:07:37,078
Maybe you don't... use soap.

869
01:07:37,145 --> 01:07:39,113
It's all right.
Go ahead. Shoot.

870
01:07:39,180 --> 01:07:42,206
Ah, ah, ah, ah!
Ah, ah, ah, ah!

871
01:07:42,283 --> 01:07:46,310
Look here. I think
we ought to toss for it.
Oh, very well.

872
01:07:46,388 --> 01:07:48,322
Head or tail?
Um, head.

873
01:07:48,390 --> 01:07:50,858
Tail. Your break.
But I didn't see it.

874
01:07:50,925 --> 01:07:55,760
Oh, I beg your pardon.
There.
Oh, yes, yes.

875
01:07:55,830 --> 01:07:57,855
Well, you win.
Yeah.

876
01:07:59,167 --> 01:08:01,965
Uh, just hold my coat
a minute, will ya?

877
01:08:02,036 --> 01:08:05,597
Thank you.
It's my next shot.
Thanks. Go ahead.

878
01:08:05,673 --> 01:08:08,608
Don't put it down.
Got some valuable papers
in the pocket.

879
01:08:08,676 --> 01:08:10,974
Go ahead. Shoot.

880
01:08:11,045 --> 01:08:13,377
Very difficult for me.
Yeah. Ah!
