1
00:01:26,299 --> 00:01:33,296
This dance is dancing.

2
00:01:37,310 --> 00:01:47,652
It's nothing if it's
not for dance.

3
00:01:48,221 --> 00:01:56,424
What is its relation with breath?

4
00:01:59,499 --> 00:02:09,602
In fact, this is breath.

5
00:02:30,297 --> 00:02:34,131
It's in the drifting heart.

6
00:02:34,301 --> 00:02:36,462
Indeed, it's dance!

7
00:02:37,471 --> 00:02:39,132
It's in the whole life.

8
00:02:39,206 --> 00:02:41,140
It's in the rhythm of the tunes.

9
00:02:41,208 --> 00:02:43,142
Indeed, it's dance!

10
00:02:45,212 --> 00:02:46,736
I've achieved it.

11
00:02:46,813 --> 00:02:48,303
It's my shadow.

12
00:02:48,482 --> 00:02:50,313
I've achieved it.

13
00:02:50,383 --> 00:02:52,146
It's my shadow.

14
00:02:52,219 --> 00:02:55,484
It's in all my veins.

15
00:02:55,555 --> 00:02:57,648
It's in every particle of my body.

16
00:02:57,724 --> 00:02:59,157
Dance.

17
00:03:55,215 --> 00:03:57,479
It's in the flash
of the eye-lashes.

18
00:03:57,551 --> 00:03:59,143
It's in the thumping of the hand.

19
00:03:59,219 --> 00:04:01,084
Indeed, it's dance!

20
00:04:02,155 --> 00:04:04,089
It's in my passions.

21
00:04:04,157 --> 00:04:06,091
It's in the yearning
of the spirit.

22
00:04:06,159 --> 00:04:08,093
Indeed, it's dance!

23
00:04:10,163 --> 00:04:11,255
It's compassion.

24
00:04:11,331 --> 00:04:13,492
It's the material desire.

25
00:04:13,567 --> 00:04:15,091
It's compassion.

26
00:04:15,168 --> 00:04:17,261
It's the material desire.

27
00:04:17,337 --> 00:04:20,101
It's a dream and it's a reality.

28
00:04:20,173 --> 00:04:22,368
Verily, it's the need as well.

29
00:04:22,442 --> 00:04:24,103
Indeed, it's dance.

30
00:04:48,401 --> 00:04:50,631
Dance!

31
00:08:42,702 --> 00:08:44,101
So, what can i do?

32
00:08:51,311 --> 00:08:53,108
Thank you.

33
00:08:57,283 --> 00:09:01,447
Have you directed in
any film? - Not yet so far.

34
00:09:01,588 --> 00:09:05,217
Any experience? Any training under
some established dance director?

35
00:09:06,392 --> 00:09:08,223
Sir, i don't feel that any
training is needed...

36
00:09:08,294 --> 00:09:09,556
...to become a choreographer.

37
00:09:11,130 --> 00:09:12,222
Why is that so?

38
00:09:12,398 --> 00:09:13,456
Sir, i know dance.

39
00:09:14,467 --> 00:09:16,401
You can take my audition
if you want to.

40
00:09:17,470 --> 00:09:20,530
Look, whoever comes here
is no doubt talented.

41
00:09:22,342 --> 00:09:25,243
Anyway, take this song cd.

42
00:09:25,478 --> 00:09:28,345
And, you know, compose something
and show it to me. - Fine.

43
00:09:29,249 --> 00:09:32,241
Look, i won't promise you,
but if i like your work...

44
00:09:32,318 --> 00:09:35,253
...then, maybe, we can move ahead.

45
00:09:35,421 --> 00:09:37,355
Is that clear?
- Okay, sir.

46
00:09:37,423 --> 00:09:38,481
Thank you, sir.

47
00:09:38,558 --> 00:09:39,616
Who is it?

48
00:09:42,262 --> 00:09:45,254
My world is by you.

49
00:09:45,565 --> 00:09:47,089
And, my life is by you.

50
00:09:47,166 --> 00:09:50,158
And, what more should i seek?

51
00:09:50,436 --> 00:09:53,098
As, all the bliss is mine.

52
00:09:53,273 --> 00:09:57,607
I've become the colour
that you created.

53
00:10:00,580 --> 00:10:02,104
Hi.

54
00:10:02,515 --> 00:10:04,779
I think i saw you in the office
of shaan productions.

55
00:10:06,286 --> 00:10:07,446
Do you work there?

56
00:10:09,389 --> 00:10:11,118
No.

57
00:10:12,625 --> 00:10:15,185
I'm an actor. But, haven't
acted as yet.

58
00:10:19,299 --> 00:10:20,732
I went for that film.

59
00:10:21,401 --> 00:10:23,460
But, they wanted a dancer hero...

60
00:10:23,536 --> 00:10:26,471
...and, i don't know how to dance.

61
00:10:27,640 --> 00:10:29,130
You?

62
00:10:30,209 --> 00:10:31,301
I'm a dance director.

63
00:10:33,746 --> 00:10:35,475
But, haven't directed
any dance as yet.

64
00:10:37,317 --> 00:10:38,477
Superb!

65
00:10:38,751 --> 00:10:40,150
Great!

66
00:10:40,420 --> 00:10:42,149
Fantastic!

67
00:10:53,733 --> 00:10:55,496
If there's a demand
in the industry...

68
00:10:55,568 --> 00:10:57,160
...for an actor to be a dancer...

69
00:10:57,236 --> 00:10:58,760
...then who am i to say
anything about it?

70
00:11:01,174 --> 00:11:02,573
And, i still find all
this a bit silly.

71
00:11:02,642 --> 00:11:04,109
One, two three, you know?

72
00:11:05,678 --> 00:11:08,272
Sorry. I didn't mean
to degrade dance.

73
00:11:11,451 --> 00:11:14,386
By the way, which institute
did you learn it from?

74
00:11:15,588 --> 00:11:18,284
I never learnt it from any
institute. - You mean?

75
00:11:36,609 --> 00:11:38,474
After hearing you out, it's
for the first time...

76
00:11:38,544 --> 00:11:40,671
...that an interest for dance
is developing in me.

77
00:11:48,154 --> 00:11:50,145
Can you teach me?

78
00:11:53,493 --> 00:11:54,551
I don't teach.

79
00:11:56,496 --> 00:11:57,554
Why?

80
00:12:01,601 --> 00:12:03,432
Don't you feel that; if
you have something...

81
00:12:03,503 --> 00:12:06,267
...that is worth teaching then
you should teach it!

82
00:12:17,850 --> 00:12:19,112
Nice meeting you.

83
00:12:20,453 --> 00:12:21,511
Abhi.

84
00:12:21,587 --> 00:12:23,111
Abhinav.

85
00:12:23,189 --> 00:12:25,123
Reva.

86
00:12:29,462 --> 00:12:30,520
Who are you?

87
00:12:33,466 --> 00:12:35,297
My world is by you.

88
00:12:36,135 --> 00:12:38,467
And, my life is by you.

89
00:12:38,538 --> 00:12:40,563
And, what more should i seek?

90
00:12:41,307 --> 00:12:43,298
As, all the bliss is mine.

91
00:12:46,312 --> 00:12:48,473
The memories have wiped out.

92
00:12:48,548 --> 00:12:50,209
And, i've recoiled as such.

93
00:12:50,483 --> 00:12:55,648
Now, your way is my way.

94
00:12:59,492 --> 00:13:01,084
It's in your love that i...

95
00:13:33,459 --> 00:13:35,120
i think you're perfect.

96
00:13:47,473 --> 00:13:50,306
I'll do a screen test of yours
and show it to my producer.

97
00:13:53,312 --> 00:13:55,473
Hanif-samar! They have done
50 super-hit films!

98
00:13:55,548 --> 00:13:56,606
And, you...

99
00:13:56,682 --> 00:13:58,616
you want to say that you need
some changes in their music?

100
00:13:58,718 --> 00:14:00,151
Sir, i didn't mean to...

101
00:14:01,687 --> 00:14:03,086
...and what do you think of yourself?

102
00:14:03,356 --> 00:14:06,553
If you want to dance, then you wll
do it on this music itself!

103
00:14:09,428 --> 00:14:11,589
Sir, then i won't be
able to do this song.

104
00:14:13,266 --> 00:14:15,097
Sorry for wasting your time.

105
00:14:32,652 --> 00:14:34,119
The producer saw your screen test?

106
00:14:36,689 --> 00:14:38,122
And?

107
00:14:40,660 --> 00:14:42,127
What?

108
00:14:44,463 --> 00:14:46,294
He went crazy at your screen test.

109
00:14:52,305 --> 00:14:54,136
I'm damn happy for you and...

110
00:14:55,708 --> 00:14:57,141
i'm happy for myself.

111
00:14:58,544 --> 00:15:00,136
Great! Superb!

112
00:15:00,346 --> 00:15:01,472
Fantastic!

113
00:15:03,416 --> 00:15:05,077
You know to dance, isn't it?

114
00:15:13,259 --> 00:15:15,090
I'm out of practice.

115
00:15:15,428 --> 00:15:17,089
Give me two weeks.

116
00:15:26,505 --> 00:15:28,097
Reva...

117
00:15:29,375 --> 00:15:31,434
reva, i don't feel
nice to say that...

118
00:15:31,510 --> 00:15:32,602
...but, the rent of two months
is still pending.

119
00:15:33,713 --> 00:15:35,510
Sorry. What should i do?

120
00:15:35,648 --> 00:15:38,276
Why do you say sorry? It's my fault.

121
00:15:40,519 --> 00:15:42,646
If you can give me two more weeks...

122
00:15:55,735 --> 00:15:57,293
hello?
- Hello, reva?

123
00:15:57,470 --> 00:16:00,132
Hi, abhinav here. The bus guy.

124
00:16:00,473 --> 00:16:01,667
I got your number from
shaan productions.

125
00:16:01,741 --> 00:16:04,141
Look, there's a new director
called sandesh.

126
00:16:04,243 --> 00:16:06,404
I've got a break in his film.
It's very big film.

127
00:16:06,545 --> 00:16:09,571
And, yes, yes, yes. I've
to know how to dance.

128
00:16:09,682 --> 00:16:11,411
And, i've decided
that i'll learn it.

129
00:16:11,584 --> 00:16:13,245
And, i'll learn it only from you.

130
00:16:13,419 --> 00:16:15,250
So, please, don't say no! Okay?

131
00:16:16,422 --> 00:16:18,413
And, yeah! It's not that
i'll learn it for free.

132
00:16:18,557 --> 00:16:21,424
I'll give you the fees. But,
i won't be giving much.

133
00:16:22,261 --> 00:16:25,162
So, please agree! Please,
reva, please!

134
00:16:26,432 --> 00:16:29,265
I've achieved it.

135
00:16:30,269 --> 00:16:32,260
It's my shadow.

136
00:16:33,706 --> 00:16:37,267
It's in all my veins.

137
00:16:38,511 --> 00:16:41,503
It's in every particle of my body.

138
00:18:12,605 --> 00:18:14,072
Don't stop.

139
00:18:16,475 --> 00:18:20,411
It's just, that i feel
like keep watching.

140
00:18:42,501 --> 00:18:44,093
One thing is for sure.

141
00:18:44,503 --> 00:18:46,437
After watching you dance,
i feel like...

142
00:18:46,505 --> 00:18:48,268
...i can never even reach
till the 'd' of dance.

143
00:18:49,275 --> 00:18:50,606
I won't be able to do this.
It won't happen.

144
00:18:51,377 --> 00:18:53,436
I don't like that word.
- Which?

145
00:18:59,385 --> 00:19:00,374
'No.'

146
00:19:03,322 --> 00:19:04,448
Okay.

147
00:19:05,391 --> 00:19:07,052
Point noted.

148
00:19:11,597 --> 00:19:13,064
Where's the music?

149
00:19:13,532 --> 00:19:15,261
Music isn't needed to learn dance.

150
00:19:16,402 --> 00:19:17,460
What?

151
00:19:17,570 --> 00:19:19,060
Raise your hands.

152
00:19:24,510 --> 00:19:26,410
Now?
- Keep standing like that.

153
00:19:44,263 --> 00:19:47,426
Can i lower my hands, now?
- Why?

154
00:19:49,268 --> 00:19:50,428
Is it paining?

155
00:19:51,270 --> 00:19:52,430
No.

156
00:19:52,505 --> 00:19:54,097
I'm looking like a fool.

157
00:19:57,443 --> 00:19:58,705
Do you feel that i'm
making you do that...

158
00:19:58,777 --> 00:20:00,108
...so that you should
look like a fool?

159
00:20:02,448 --> 00:20:03,506
No.

160
00:20:04,783 --> 00:20:06,614
Do you trust me?

161
00:20:09,788 --> 00:20:11,517
What else can be the reason
for me to stand here?

162
00:21:17,389 --> 00:21:19,118
Who are you?
- What?

163
00:21:20,459 --> 00:21:23,622
Did you fall from the sky?
- Goa.

164
00:21:24,296 --> 00:21:25,456
And?

165
00:21:26,599 --> 00:21:28,464
The thing, that i want to do...

166
00:21:28,534 --> 00:21:31,298
mama and papa were least
interested in that.

167
00:21:33,606 --> 00:21:36,404
So, i left the house.
And, came here.

168
00:21:40,479 --> 00:21:42,140
I know that you won't be asking,
so i'll tell it myself.

169
00:21:43,649 --> 00:21:45,139
My parents have expired.

170
00:21:45,484 --> 00:21:47,315
And, i've one sister,
who stays in nainital.

171
00:21:49,321 --> 00:21:51,755
But, there was no question
of staying with her.

172
00:21:52,491 --> 00:21:53,753
Because, i had already
decided that...

173
00:21:53,826 --> 00:21:55,487
...i would be coming to mumbai and...

174
00:21:55,561 --> 00:21:57,153
...would be ruling over
this film industry.

175
00:22:03,268 --> 00:22:05,099
I've got a job in nfd computers.

176
00:22:05,270 --> 00:22:06,430
Part-time.

177
00:22:06,572 --> 00:22:08,096
From 4:00 to 7:30.

178
00:22:09,174 --> 00:22:10,266
Job?

179
00:22:11,710 --> 00:22:13,109
I'll get some money.

180
00:22:13,612 --> 00:22:16,274
Whatever i brought with
me; is almost spent.

181
00:22:18,517 --> 00:22:20,109
I can't do a full time job.

182
00:22:22,187 --> 00:22:24,121
As i need time for my dance as well.

183
00:22:32,631 --> 00:22:34,121
Dance!

184
00:23:41,400 --> 00:23:43,129
Want to see a movie?

185
00:23:45,471 --> 00:23:47,132
How did you find the film?

186
00:23:47,673 --> 00:23:49,470
Great! Superb!

187
00:23:49,641 --> 00:23:51,131
Fantastic!

188
00:23:52,411 --> 00:23:55,312
Action, comedy, romance, tears;
everything was there in it.

189
00:23:55,547 --> 00:23:56,673
That's why, it's a super-hit.

190
00:23:59,551 --> 00:24:01,075
That wasn't the reply
to my question.

191
00:24:03,422 --> 00:24:07,483
Reva, i want to become an actor...

192
00:24:07,659 --> 00:24:09,354
...because, i want to
earn loads of fame.

193
00:24:10,496 --> 00:24:12,088
And, money as well.

194
00:24:12,564 --> 00:24:15,260
So, it's in my best interests
that i should quickly learn...

195
00:24:15,334 --> 00:24:18,633
...whatever that is usually
needed over here.

196
00:24:26,512 --> 00:24:28,104
The film was just rubbish.

197
00:24:56,475 --> 00:24:57,533
Are you mad?

198
00:24:57,876 --> 00:24:59,741
You won't be getting such
a big offer too often.

199
00:25:01,613 --> 00:25:03,410
Reva, please take my word
and say yes to it.

200
00:25:05,584 --> 00:25:07,415
Do you have any idea as
to how far will you go...

201
00:25:07,486 --> 00:25:09,078
...by associating with this company.

202
00:25:09,254 --> 00:25:11,085
You can obtain work from
the whole of the world.

203
00:25:11,156 --> 00:25:12,555
Abhi, you know it
that i don't work...

204
00:25:12,624 --> 00:25:14,091
...just for the sake
of obtaining work.

205
00:25:15,427 --> 00:25:17,361
I haven't come here to
earn money or fame.

206
00:25:18,564 --> 00:25:20,088
And, dance...

207
00:25:20,632 --> 00:25:22,429
had i just wanted to dance, then...

208
00:25:22,501 --> 00:25:24,264
...i could have done
it in goa as well.

209
00:25:26,505 --> 00:25:27,563
Abhi...

210
00:25:27,639 --> 00:25:29,436
the form in which i want
to perceive dance...

211
00:25:29,508 --> 00:25:31,772
...is only possible in films.

212
00:25:33,445 --> 00:25:35,606
Lights, sets, set-designs,
costumes, camera...

213
00:25:36,448 --> 00:25:38,643
i want to perceive dance in
my own way through all this.

214
00:25:39,585 --> 00:25:41,109
I want to show it.

215
00:25:43,589 --> 00:25:47,116
And, had i come here just for the
sake of living a routine life...

216
00:25:47,192 --> 00:25:50,628
...then, whatever you said;
might very well apply.

217
00:25:51,663 --> 00:25:53,790
To give what the industry wants.

218
00:25:55,200 --> 00:25:57,134
And, walk off after taking my money.

219
00:25:58,403 --> 00:26:00,234
But, abhi, that is not my objective.

220
00:26:02,541 --> 00:26:04,065
Do you know this industry?

221
00:26:06,411 --> 00:26:09,244
Do you feel that these people
need your innovation?

222
00:26:14,620 --> 00:26:16,485
Abhi, it's not that
they don't want it.

223
00:26:19,424 --> 00:26:22,257
It's just, that they are unable
to see it through my eyes.

224
00:26:24,363 --> 00:26:27,696
And, to show them and explain
them; is my responsibility.

225
00:26:30,302 --> 00:26:33,100
Abhi, do you feel that
whatever i want...

226
00:26:33,171 --> 00:26:36,265
can i be able to do it ever?

227
00:26:36,675 --> 00:26:38,108
Seriously?

228
00:26:41,580 --> 00:26:43,104
No.

229
00:26:51,590 --> 00:26:53,114
Reva...

230
00:26:53,659 --> 00:26:55,286
the day you get what you want...

231
00:26:56,595 --> 00:26:58,119
i'll be happier than you.

232
00:26:59,298 --> 00:27:00,390
I know.

233
00:28:24,483 --> 00:28:26,075
I like your style.

234
00:28:29,621 --> 00:28:31,748
Have you ever done a film before?
- No.

235
00:28:33,692 --> 00:28:35,091
Very original.

236
00:28:38,563 --> 00:28:40,360
Actually, i want to do something
similar in my film.

237
00:28:41,366 --> 00:28:43,266
I've got a song recorded
for my film.

238
00:28:43,502 --> 00:28:45,094
I'll send the cd along with abhi.

239
00:28:46,438 --> 00:28:48,099
Let's see, what you can do.

240
00:29:09,394 --> 00:29:11,658
I've the passion in me, so i'll
face whatever comes ahead.

241
00:29:12,064 --> 00:29:14,658
Whoever comes to face me,
can never be like me.

242
00:29:15,133 --> 00:29:17,658
And, at my feet lies
the whole world.

243
00:29:17,736 --> 00:29:20,466
The whole. The whole.
The whole.

244
00:29:21,239 --> 00:29:23,673
I've the passion in me, so i'll
face whatever comes ahead.

245
00:29:24,242 --> 00:29:26,733
Whoever comes to face me,
can never be like me.

246
00:29:27,245 --> 00:29:29,611
And, at my feet lies
the whole world.

247
00:29:29,681 --> 00:29:32,616
The whole. The whole.
The whole.

248
00:29:35,253 --> 00:29:36,345
I love it.

249
00:29:36,421 --> 00:29:37,479
Yes!

250
00:31:52,757 --> 00:31:54,156
I love you.

251
00:32:04,269 --> 00:32:06,100
I love your eyes.

252
00:32:07,439 --> 00:32:09,703
I love your lips. I love your ears.

253
00:32:11,643 --> 00:32:13,110
I love your hair.

254
00:32:15,280 --> 00:32:17,111
I love your coffee.

255
00:32:17,649 --> 00:32:19,116
I love your voice.

256
00:32:20,852 --> 00:32:22,114
I love your ear-rings.

257
00:32:23,388 --> 00:32:25,117
I'm not wearing ear-ring.

258
00:32:26,524 --> 00:32:28,287
I know.

259
00:32:28,460 --> 00:32:30,121
But...

260
00:32:30,195 --> 00:32:32,186
when you do, i'm sure
i'll love them.

261
00:32:37,469 --> 00:32:39,130
And, what else?

262
00:32:42,540 --> 00:32:44,132
I love it that you're short.

263
00:32:46,478 --> 00:32:48,605
I love you because you're
very boring.

264
00:32:58,323 --> 00:33:00,154
I love that.

265
00:33:00,759 --> 00:33:02,090
Whatever it is.

266
00:33:06,431 --> 00:33:08,092
I love the way you never smile.

267
00:33:40,298 --> 00:33:41,390
So...

268
00:33:42,467 --> 00:33:44,128
here's your house.

269
00:33:44,302 --> 00:33:46,463
You're safe, sound and dry.

270
00:33:47,739 --> 00:33:50,469
And, i'm out of here. Good night.

271
00:33:50,675 --> 00:33:52,142
Want some coffee?

272
00:34:00,752 --> 00:34:02,083
Abhi...

273
00:38:06,230 --> 00:38:14,399
life is uniting with
someone as such.

274
00:38:17,609 --> 00:38:26,244
Life is uniting with
someone as such.

275
00:38:28,419 --> 00:38:30,250
No, no.

276
00:38:31,422 --> 00:38:33,253
No, no.

277
00:38:34,258 --> 00:38:36,249
Never ever.

278
00:38:37,095 --> 00:38:40,292
Never ever i deemed it this way.

279
00:38:46,437 --> 00:38:54,503
Life is uniting with
someone as such.

280
00:38:58,116 --> 00:39:06,216
Life is uniting with
someone as such.

281
00:39:08,393 --> 00:39:10,452
No, no.

282
00:39:11,462 --> 00:39:13,555
No, no.

283
00:39:14,399 --> 00:39:16,264
Never ever.

284
00:39:17,402 --> 00:39:20,394
Never ever i deemed it this way.

285
00:39:22,240 --> 00:39:24,071
Hey, dance.

286
00:39:26,244 --> 00:39:29,236
Hey, dance.

287
00:39:31,482 --> 00:39:35,248
Hey, dance.

288
00:39:55,106 --> 00:39:58,439
The foot.

289
00:40:00,278 --> 00:40:02,109
When i keep it.

290
00:40:03,448 --> 00:40:10,183
I find that i'm waiting for him.

291
00:40:12,457 --> 00:40:15,620
The foot.

292
00:40:17,462 --> 00:40:19,123
When i keep it.

293
00:40:20,698 --> 00:40:27,297
I find that i'm waiting for him.

294
00:40:29,307 --> 00:40:31,537
Do it and don't stop.

295
00:40:32,410 --> 00:40:35,641
And, life will be all set to move.

296
00:40:41,552 --> 00:40:50,153
Life gets united with
someone as such.

297
00:40:53,331 --> 00:41:01,636
Life gets united with
someone as such.

298
00:41:03,641 --> 00:41:06,109
Sometimes, here.

299
00:41:06,511 --> 00:41:09,105
Sometimes, there.

300
00:41:09,514 --> 00:41:12,506
Sometimes, somewhere else.

301
00:41:13,451 --> 00:41:15,715
It gets united.

302
00:41:16,287 --> 00:41:18,653
Hey, dance.

303
00:41:21,459 --> 00:41:24,394
Hey, dance.

304
00:41:27,298 --> 00:41:30,290
Hey, dance.

305
00:41:33,471 --> 00:41:36,304
Hey, dance.

306
00:42:47,478 --> 00:42:49,139
Camera...

307
00:42:49,480 --> 00:42:51,812
...is gradually zooming
into your face.

308
00:42:54,552 --> 00:42:58,488
And, your gaze is fixed
far away on the traffic.

309
00:43:00,424 --> 00:43:02,085
Suddenly, the camera
is swish-panned!

310
00:43:05,429 --> 00:43:08,489
Great. - It is to be seen with
sound and music.

311
00:43:10,635 --> 00:43:13,103
You have to give a trial of
the costume too. Don't forget.

312
00:43:13,604 --> 00:43:15,094
And we have to remove
the instances...

313
00:43:15,273 --> 00:43:16,433
prasad will look after everything.

314
00:43:16,607 --> 00:43:17,699
And yes...

315
00:43:17,775 --> 00:43:21,108
tell that girl that she cannot
do this film. - Which girl?

316
00:43:21,512 --> 00:43:24,709
That... that choreographer of yours.
- But...

317
00:43:26,651 --> 00:43:28,516
but why?

318
00:43:30,388 --> 00:43:31,616
Because the heroine ayesha wants...

319
00:43:31,689 --> 00:43:33,179
...to work with the dance
director shaheen.

320
00:44:17,702 --> 00:44:19,260
Do you want to see sandesh's song?

321
00:44:31,582 --> 00:44:34,107
According to your character in...

322
00:44:35,619 --> 00:44:37,109
...the film you shouldn't
dance at all.

323
00:44:41,292 --> 00:44:43,123
The way i am seeing it...

324
00:44:45,463 --> 00:44:48,125
think that there is such a set.

325
00:45:07,351 --> 00:45:09,080
The world is at your feet.

326
00:45:45,723 --> 00:45:47,122
In senses...

327
00:45:48,459 --> 00:45:50,188
who will be?

328
00:45:50,661 --> 00:45:54,859
Like me...

329
00:46:21,625 --> 00:46:23,092
there is fire in the senses.

330
00:46:23,160 --> 00:46:24,422
It is to be seen...
whatever will be.

331
00:46:24,495 --> 00:46:27,430
There will be nobody like
me who will face me.

332
00:46:27,498 --> 00:46:30,433
The whole world is at my feet.

333
00:46:30,568 --> 00:46:33,162
The whole...

334
00:46:33,671 --> 00:46:35,104
there is fire in the senses.

335
00:46:35,172 --> 00:46:36,434
It is to be seen...
whatever will be.

336
00:46:36,574 --> 00:46:39,270
There will be nobody like
me who will face me.

337
00:46:39,443 --> 00:46:42,378
The whole world is at my feet.

338
00:46:42,513 --> 00:46:45,277
The whole...

339
00:46:58,195 --> 00:46:59,457
you have such a colour
and attitude...

340
00:46:59,530 --> 00:47:00,554
we haven't heard or seen it ever.

341
00:47:00,664 --> 00:47:03,599
The one who is with you...
will bloom.

342
00:47:04,135 --> 00:47:06,603
Your colour is such...
it falls on everyone.

343
00:47:07,071 --> 00:47:09,665
Yours...

344
00:47:10,074 --> 00:47:11,405
you have such a colour
and attitude...

345
00:47:11,475 --> 00:47:12,669
we haven't heard or seen it ever.

346
00:47:13,144 --> 00:47:15,578
The one who is with you...
will bloom.

347
00:47:16,247 --> 00:47:18,681
Your colour is such...
it falls on everyone.

348
00:47:19,150 --> 00:47:21,482
Yours...

349
00:47:37,601 --> 00:47:40,092
i don't want anything incomplete.

350
00:47:40,437 --> 00:47:43,167
I want everything.

351
00:47:43,574 --> 00:47:46,099
Whatever is the best is here...

352
00:47:46,443 --> 00:47:48,104
here...

353
00:47:49,613 --> 00:47:52,275
i don't want anything incomplete.

354
00:47:52,516 --> 00:47:55,280
I want everything.

355
00:47:55,553 --> 00:47:58,283
Whatever is the best is here...

356
00:47:58,455 --> 00:48:01,049
here...

357
00:48:01,592 --> 00:48:04,322
how much ever strength
anyone has...

358
00:48:04,395 --> 00:48:07,387
the person gets more.

359
00:48:07,531 --> 00:48:10,329
Who will live on today,
tomorrow and day after?

360
00:48:10,501 --> 00:48:13,402
Never...

361
00:48:13,604 --> 00:48:16,402
how much ever strength
anyone has...

362
00:48:16,540 --> 00:48:19,407
the person gets more.

363
00:48:19,543 --> 00:48:22,341
Who will live on today,
tomorrow and day after?

364
00:48:22,479 --> 00:48:25,243
Never...

365
00:48:46,270 --> 00:48:47,430
just once...

366
00:48:47,838 --> 00:48:49,567
see what she has done just once.

367
00:48:53,577 --> 00:48:55,602
It must be fantastic.
- It is.

368
00:48:57,514 --> 00:48:59,448
Abhi... you understand this.

369
00:49:01,385 --> 00:49:03,046
The industry doesn't
work just on talent.

370
00:49:05,322 --> 00:49:07,051
The choreographer shaheen khan.

371
00:49:07,591 --> 00:49:09,058
He is very ordinary.

372
00:49:10,461 --> 00:49:12,053
But his networking is very strong.

373
00:49:13,397 --> 00:49:15,058
The right parties...

374
00:49:16,467 --> 00:49:18,059
page three.

375
00:49:18,569 --> 00:49:20,230
You know what i am talking
about? Zee... screen.

376
00:49:20,404 --> 00:49:22,065
He has got two filmfare awards.

377
00:49:23,807 --> 00:49:25,399
The producers think
that the value of...

378
00:49:25,476 --> 00:49:27,410
...the movie increases
due to his being in it.

379
00:49:31,482 --> 00:49:33,245
And... he is a good friend
of the superstar ayesha.

380
00:49:35,352 --> 00:49:40,688
And i have got this first
break due to all these.

381
00:49:46,664 --> 00:49:48,097
It was my mistake.

382
00:49:49,600 --> 00:49:51,568
I was excited looking at her dance.
And i committed to her.

383
00:50:04,782 --> 00:50:06,113
Why are you so quiet?

384
00:50:09,119 --> 00:50:11,110
You are quiet since evening.

385
00:50:11,522 --> 00:50:13,114
Is something wrong?

386
00:50:17,461 --> 00:50:21,727
What happened, abhi? What's wrong?

387
00:50:24,468 --> 00:50:27,460
They have taken some other
dancer in your place.

388
00:50:46,490 --> 00:50:48,651
Not because sandesh didn't
like your place.

389
00:50:50,561 --> 00:50:52,324
But ayesha...
- i don't want to hear.

390
00:50:56,633 --> 00:50:59,568
If they don't want me.
They don't want me.

391
00:51:02,573 --> 00:51:05,440
I am not concerned with
their problems.

392
00:51:17,654 --> 00:51:20,122
I tried to convince sandesh...
- abhi, i...

393
00:51:23,594 --> 00:51:25,118
we will not speak about this.

394
00:51:26,296 --> 00:51:28,127
As far as i am concerned.

395
00:51:28,665 --> 00:51:30,132
This topic is over.

396
00:51:46,583 --> 00:51:48,141
Even i will leave this film.

397
00:51:52,489 --> 00:51:54,150
Don't talk nonsense. Abhi.

398
00:51:54,825 --> 00:51:57,658
Our work and we are different.

399
00:51:58,629 --> 00:52:00,153
Don't mix the two.

400
00:52:31,462 --> 00:52:33,123
I want to be alone for a while.

401
00:52:44,741 --> 00:52:46,140
Dance...

402
00:52:50,547 --> 00:52:52,139
dance...

403
00:52:56,420 --> 00:52:58,149
dance...

404
00:53:01,758 --> 00:53:03,589
dance...

405
00:53:31,722 --> 00:53:35,715
you wanted to be alone.
So i left you.

406
00:53:39,796 --> 00:53:41,457
Now i want to be with you.

407
00:53:55,679 --> 00:54:01,481
It has started relating
with someone like this...

408
00:54:02,819 --> 00:54:04,081
this life.

409
00:54:07,090 --> 00:54:12,687
It has started relating
with someone like this...

410
00:54:14,531 --> 00:54:16,089
this life.

411
00:54:16,500 --> 00:54:17,558
Should i bring more vegetable?

412
00:54:17,634 --> 00:54:19,431
No... no...

413
00:54:20,437 --> 00:54:22,428
no... no...

414
00:54:23,440 --> 00:54:25,374
never... never...

415
00:54:26,376 --> 00:54:29,607
i had never thought about it.

416
00:54:31,782 --> 00:54:33,113
Dance...

417
00:54:37,588 --> 00:54:39,112
dance...

418
00:54:43,594 --> 00:54:45,118
dance...

419
00:54:49,299 --> 00:54:51,130
dance...

420
00:55:17,160 --> 00:55:18,422
there is fire in the senses.

421
00:55:18,495 --> 00:55:20,087
It is to be seen...
whatever will be.

422
00:55:20,263 --> 00:55:24,097
There will be nobody like
me who will face me.

423
00:55:24,267 --> 00:55:27,100
The whole world is at my feet.

424
00:55:27,371 --> 00:55:29,601
The whole...

425
00:55:30,440 --> 00:55:31,600
there is fire in the senses.

426
00:55:31,675 --> 00:55:33,108
It is to be seen...
whatever will be.

427
00:55:33,276 --> 00:55:35,836
There will be nobody like
me who will face me.

428
00:55:36,313 --> 00:55:39,111
The whole world is at my feet.

429
00:55:39,282 --> 00:55:42,274
The whole...

430
00:55:44,655 --> 00:55:46,122
it looks like a circus.

431
00:55:46,657 --> 00:55:49,626
Sir. The public will
like it. Guaranteed.

432
00:55:50,394 --> 00:55:51,520
Sir...

433
00:55:51,595 --> 00:55:53,290
there was a similar song
in kal raho na no.

434
00:55:53,397 --> 00:55:55,126
It had worked for just fifty weeks.

435
00:55:57,401 --> 00:55:58,459
It is bad...

436
00:56:00,570 --> 00:56:02,060
but it is business.

437
00:56:04,341 --> 00:56:07,071
The whole...

438
00:56:13,617 --> 00:56:16,347
cut it. Yes. That was
a very nice shot, yes.

439
00:56:16,586 --> 00:56:18,076
Not now. Get out.

440
00:56:18,422 --> 00:56:19,480
This was nice. We will take the...

441
00:56:19,556 --> 00:56:21,148
...next shot from up there.

442
00:57:14,678 --> 00:57:16,077
Yes...
- autograph please.

443
00:57:19,750 --> 00:57:22,480
He is so cute.
- I know.

444
00:57:50,447 --> 00:57:52,506
Abhi... is it so important for you?
- What?

445
00:57:53,183 --> 00:57:54,275
That everyone should know you.

446
00:57:54,384 --> 00:57:56,113
And that everyone should
appreciate you?

447
00:57:57,788 --> 00:58:00,655
See. Everyone doesn't want
to become like you.

448
00:58:01,224 --> 00:58:03,215
I am a normal man. I don't
want to become god.

449
00:58:03,593 --> 00:58:06,061
I want many fans that come
and take my autograph.

450
00:58:06,396 --> 00:58:09,388
I want many awards and i want
a lot of money. Okay?

451
00:58:09,466 --> 00:58:10,524
Don't say things that
you don't mean.

452
00:58:10,600 --> 00:58:13,535
No. I mean it. - You don't.
- I do. - you don't. - i do.

453
00:58:14,237 --> 00:58:15,397
You don't.
- Yes, i do.

454
00:58:16,406 --> 00:58:19,239
You don't.
- No, i don't.

455
00:58:40,363 --> 00:58:43,423
Hey... hey... move...

456
00:58:52,442 --> 00:58:57,106

457
00:59:01,585 --> 00:59:03,052

458
00:59:48,632 --> 00:59:50,099
hello?

459
00:59:51,101 --> 00:59:52,363
Yes. I am reva here.

460
00:59:56,606 --> 00:59:58,437
Reva...
- i got a call from a producer.

461
00:59:58,508 --> 01:00:00,100
He is very excited
looking at my work.

462
01:00:00,644 --> 01:00:02,168
Wow... excited?

463
01:00:02,279 --> 01:00:03,507
Of course i am excited.

464
01:00:03,647 --> 01:00:04,705
Congrats...

465
01:00:04,781 --> 01:00:06,646
excuse me, sir?
- Yes? - the shot is ready.

466
01:00:07,651 --> 01:00:09,448
Anyway. See. My shot is ready.

467
01:00:10,287 --> 01:00:12,118
I will meet you later, okay? Bye.

468
01:00:13,623 --> 01:00:15,113
Please... please reva have a seat.

469
01:00:15,191 --> 01:00:17,125
I am rakesh.
- Thank you, sir. - yes. - please.

470
01:00:19,296 --> 01:00:21,127
Anyways.

471
01:00:21,298 --> 01:00:23,198
You must not have heard about me.

472
01:00:25,468 --> 01:00:27,299
Because i haven't made
a film till today.

473
01:00:27,604 --> 01:00:29,469
But i want to make a film.
A different film.

474
01:00:29,539 --> 01:00:31,734
A film which stands out.

475
01:00:33,810 --> 01:00:35,801
What will you have? Tea,
coffee or cold drink?

476
01:00:36,146 --> 01:00:37,306
No, nothing. Thank you.

477
01:00:37,380 --> 01:00:39,314
No. You will have to take
something. Coffee?

478
01:00:39,482 --> 01:00:40,540
Good.

479
01:00:41,718 --> 01:00:43,151
Yes, send two coffees.

480
01:00:48,491 --> 01:00:51,426
I have seen your cd. I have
seen your show reel.

481
01:00:51,628 --> 01:00:53,619
Superb. Original. Believe me.

482
01:00:53,697 --> 01:00:55,688
Mind blowing, it was.
- Thank you, sir.

483
01:00:56,433 --> 01:00:59,493
Even we have recorded excellent
songs for our film.

484
01:01:00,503 --> 01:01:02,437
The poet sameer is doing the music.
- Okay.

485
01:01:03,106 --> 01:01:05,370
And we want the newest style.

486
01:01:05,642 --> 01:01:07,269
And you will be giving it to us.

487
01:01:09,612 --> 01:01:11,603
This is the script. This is the cd.

488
01:01:12,515 --> 01:01:14,278
Once you understand the script.

489
01:01:14,684 --> 01:01:17,619
You will be able to put more
motion into your dances.

490
01:01:18,288 --> 01:01:19,380
Yes!

491
01:01:19,522 --> 01:01:22,286
The kind of style
that i saw in you...

492
01:01:22,359 --> 01:01:25,851
reva... think that you were
made for this film.

493
01:01:28,465 --> 01:01:30,524
Okay, sir. I will listen
to the songs.

494
01:01:30,667 --> 01:01:32,532
And i will get something
ready and meet you then.

495
01:01:32,736 --> 01:01:36,137
I will call you, sir.
- Reva... i have ordered coffee.

496
01:01:36,539 --> 01:01:40,475
Here. The coffee has come. Have
it and go. - Okay, sir.

497
01:01:51,488 --> 01:01:53,149
Reva...

498
01:01:54,324 --> 01:01:55,484
abhi...

499
01:01:55,558 --> 01:01:57,321
i have heard that you
know abhi very well.

500
01:01:58,495 --> 01:01:59,553
Yes. Sir.

501
01:01:59,629 --> 01:02:01,096
Yes.

502
01:02:01,431 --> 01:02:03,092
The hero has a strong
role in this script.

503
01:02:03,366 --> 01:02:05,425
Very... it means... it is
a fit role for abhi.

504
01:02:06,703 --> 01:02:08,261
Sir. Is abhi working in your film?

505
01:02:08,571 --> 01:02:10,095
That is what i want too.

506
01:02:10,540 --> 01:02:13,100
But reva, you know. Abhi
is so busy nowadays.

507
01:02:13,276 --> 01:02:15,437
It is very difficult to meet him.
Therefore... i was thinking.

508
01:02:15,578 --> 01:02:18,445
If you tell abhi to read
our script once, maybe...

509
01:02:23,386 --> 01:02:25,650
sir... it isn't my work to lead
the actor to the script.

510
01:02:26,389 --> 01:02:28,289
You are misunderstanding me.
It isn't anything like that.

511
01:02:29,526 --> 01:02:32,120
Please don't misunderstand
me. It is like this.

512
01:02:32,295 --> 01:02:34,126
If a star like abhi works
in our film once...

513
01:02:34,197 --> 01:02:36,131
...four people will invest
money in the project.

514
01:02:36,466 --> 01:02:38,457
What after that? The
film will be made.

515
01:02:40,303 --> 01:02:41,463
Just once...

516
01:02:41,671 --> 01:02:43,298
you make abhi say 'yes'.

517
01:02:44,808 --> 01:02:46,673
Your work will done and
ours will be done too.

518
01:02:51,481 --> 01:02:53,142
What do you say, reva?

519
01:02:53,216 --> 01:02:55,150
Will you speak to abhi?

520
01:03:01,591 --> 01:03:03,081
No, sir.

521
01:03:04,427 --> 01:03:06,088
Thank you very much for your time.

522
01:03:15,438 --> 01:03:19,499
Everything makes a difference.

523
01:03:19,576 --> 01:03:22,704
I guess you don't know who i am.

524
01:04:06,422 --> 01:04:13,419
From today... your feet won't
be on the floor ever. - What?

525
01:04:16,599 --> 01:04:19,432
Because your prince with
the blue horse has come.

526
01:04:29,512 --> 01:04:31,104
A car.

527
01:04:33,449 --> 01:04:35,508
A brand new car is waiting
by your door.

528
01:04:35,652 --> 01:04:37,620
And it is waiting
for you restlessly.

529
01:04:39,289 --> 01:04:41,382
So go quickly and change. We
are going for a drive.

530
01:04:41,457 --> 01:04:43,118
Come on.

531
01:04:45,795 --> 01:04:48,855
Hello, mr. Abhinav.
Hi! I saw your film.

532
01:04:49,132 --> 01:04:51,293
It was very good.
- Thank you.

533
01:04:51,734 --> 01:04:54,532
Reva... your three month's
rent is pending.

534
01:04:54,637 --> 01:04:56,468
Even the last month you...
- if you could give me...

535
01:04:56,539 --> 01:04:58,473
...a couple of weeks
more. I thought...

536
01:04:58,541 --> 01:05:00,236
...that the money would come in.

537
01:05:01,477 --> 01:05:03,240
How much is it?
- Nine thousand.

538
01:05:05,415 --> 01:05:07,076
Abhi...
- relax.

539
01:05:07,617 --> 01:05:12,350
Here it is. Take the rent
from me from now on.

540
01:05:12,422 --> 01:05:14,413
Okay? Come on. Come on!

541
01:05:21,631 --> 01:05:24,259
Here is your car and
this is your husband.

542
01:05:24,334 --> 01:05:26,268
I mean... your chauffer. Come on.

543
01:05:26,769 --> 01:05:28,259
You shouldn't have done like this.

544
01:05:28,638 --> 01:05:32,096
Oh! Shut up! Come on! Come on!

545
01:05:34,110 --> 01:05:36,442
Did you see the pickup? Oh!
That's a great car.

546
01:05:38,448 --> 01:05:40,609
And the suspension. The
road is butter, butter.

547
01:05:43,453 --> 01:05:44,511
Power steering.

548
01:05:44,621 --> 01:05:46,282
I can move the car with one finger.

549
01:05:53,463 --> 01:05:55,454
What happened?
Why are you so silent?

550
01:05:56,699 --> 01:05:58,132
Nothing.

551
01:05:59,469 --> 01:06:01,460
Now don't tell me you are
still thinking about the rent.

552
01:06:14,817 --> 01:06:16,250
Okay, so what should i have done?

553
01:06:16,486 --> 01:06:18,078
I should have seen the
drama standing there?

554
01:06:19,088 --> 01:06:20,350
Abhi... why don't you
try to understand?

555
01:06:20,423 --> 01:06:22,084
Reva... you try to understand.

556
01:06:23,426 --> 01:06:26,259
We love each other. We're together.

557
01:06:27,430 --> 01:06:30,263
Why do you make an issue of
all these small things?

558
01:06:30,366 --> 01:06:32,095
Why?

559
01:06:38,641 --> 01:06:40,108
Fine.

560
01:06:40,610 --> 01:06:42,100
I am sorry.

561
01:06:43,379 --> 01:06:47,645
Can we forget all this right
now, please? - Yes.

562
01:06:47,717 --> 01:06:49,116
Thank you.

563
01:06:51,187 --> 01:06:54,384
Okay... what happened about that...
- who?

564
01:06:55,391 --> 01:06:57,120
That producer. Who wanted
to see your show reel.

565
01:06:58,127 --> 01:06:59,458
They didn't want me.
They wanted you.

566
01:07:06,569 --> 01:07:08,059
What do you mean?

567
01:07:09,339 --> 01:07:10,601
They came to know from somewhere...

568
01:07:10,673 --> 01:07:12,402
...that i knew you. So they wanted...

569
01:07:12,475 --> 01:07:13,669
...that i bring you into the film...

570
01:07:13,743 --> 01:07:15,574
then they would give me the work.

571
01:07:24,687 --> 01:07:26,086
Okay.

572
01:07:26,255 --> 01:07:28,086
I will meet them.

573
01:07:29,092 --> 01:07:30,252
Why?

574
01:07:32,595 --> 01:07:34,620
I don't know. Maybe they
have a nice story.

575
01:07:34,697 --> 01:07:36,358
Tell them that i will meet them.

576
01:07:37,367 --> 01:07:39,096
You tell them yourself.
You call them yourself.

577
01:07:58,621 --> 01:08:00,111
Why are you so difficult, reva?

578
01:08:02,458 --> 01:08:04,551
What is the problem?
Can't we help each other?

579
01:08:07,330 --> 01:08:09,059
Abhi. I don't need anyone's help.

580
01:08:12,402 --> 01:08:14,393
I am telling this once.
I won't repeat it.

581
01:08:17,407 --> 01:08:20,069
I won't sign any film
which is based...

582
01:08:20,143 --> 01:08:22,134
...on your recommendations
or contacts.

583
01:08:23,546 --> 01:08:25,070
Not now. Not ever.

584
01:08:26,682 --> 01:08:28,616
Abhi those people don't understand...

585
01:08:28,684 --> 01:08:31,482
...my work and my ideas. Not at all.

586
01:08:32,588 --> 01:08:34,078
I cannot work with these people.

587
01:08:34,524 --> 01:08:36,082
And i thought that you
understood all this.

588
01:08:36,259 --> 01:08:38,750
Yes, i understand all this. But...

589
01:08:39,095 --> 01:08:40,585
...there is a limit to
your adamancy too.

590
01:08:40,696 --> 01:08:43,096
What do think? The industry
works just like this?

591
01:08:44,600 --> 01:08:46,830
People invest lakhs and
crores into a movie.

592
01:08:49,105 --> 01:08:51,096
Even they have to see their
commercial interest.

593
01:08:51,507 --> 01:08:52,565
They have to...

594
01:08:52,642 --> 01:08:54,303
they have to bow to the
audience's tastes.

595
01:08:54,377 --> 01:08:56,277
They cannot survive like you.
On thin air.

596
01:08:56,779 --> 01:08:58,269
She has come

597
01:08:58,781 --> 01:09:00,214
forget all this drama, reva.

598
01:09:00,383 --> 01:09:01,543
And look at reality.

599
01:09:02,452 --> 01:09:04,545
Abhi, forget it. You
never understood.

600
01:09:05,321 --> 01:09:06,583
What do you mean to say now?

601
01:09:07,223 --> 01:09:10,590
That you are the only real artiste,
bathed in milk?

602
01:09:11,661 --> 01:09:14,562
And the rest are useless
and good for nothing.

603
01:09:16,065 --> 01:09:18,056
I am talking about myself.
Not about others.

604
01:09:23,339 --> 01:09:24,397
Who are you?

605
01:09:26,409 --> 01:09:28,070
What do you think about yourself?

606
01:09:28,478 --> 01:09:31,242
That people will move
around you with work...

607
01:09:31,314 --> 01:09:33,680
...and you will kick them for
your great principles?

608
01:09:33,749 --> 01:09:35,239
Please, don't be ridiculous.

609
01:09:36,085 --> 01:09:38,076
Just forget it.

610
01:09:41,491 --> 01:09:43,083
We are very different. Abhi.

611
01:09:44,660 --> 01:09:46,093
We are very different.

612
01:09:53,269 --> 01:09:55,601
I am successful today because
i am not a fool like you.

613
01:09:58,641 --> 01:10:00,108
And...

614
01:10:00,510 --> 01:10:04,446
because of my principles,
i don't want to starve.

615
01:10:05,281 --> 01:10:08,273
On the contrary, i am
famous and rich today.

616
01:10:13,456 --> 01:10:14,514
What do you think?

617
01:10:14,657 --> 01:10:17,285
By making me away from yourself...

618
01:10:17,360 --> 01:10:19,624
...and relating me to the world,
you will hurt me? Is it?

619
01:10:21,631 --> 01:10:23,121
No way.

620
01:10:23,199 --> 01:10:24,291
Not with me.

621
01:10:24,667 --> 01:10:26,396
I have reached here
with my hard work.

622
01:10:26,669 --> 01:10:29,297
And no one can take it away from me.

623
01:10:29,472 --> 01:10:32,464
Not even you, with this
great talent of yours.

624
01:10:50,226 --> 01:10:52,160
Reva...

625
01:10:56,165 --> 01:10:58,156
reva...

626
01:10:58,701 --> 01:11:01,499
dance...

627
01:11:04,273 --> 01:11:06,104
dance...

628
01:11:11,647 --> 01:11:12,705
sir... it will take twenty minutes...

629
01:11:12,782 --> 01:11:14,443
...for the shot to be ready, okay?

630
01:13:52,641 --> 01:13:55,405
Excuse me... sir. Excuse me... sir.

631
01:13:56,479 --> 01:13:59,744
Sir, my name is lakshmi. I am
waiting for you since the last 2 hrs.

632
01:14:00,416 --> 01:14:03,613
Oh. Come in. Come in.
- No, sir. I am really...

633
01:14:03,686 --> 01:14:05,415
just come in, i am really...
- just come in. It's raining.

634
01:14:06,422 --> 01:14:07,480
Thank you, sir.

635
01:14:08,090 --> 01:14:10,251
I am so sorry, sir. I am
a costume designer sir.

636
01:14:10,426 --> 01:14:12,621
I can make anything. Sir.
Anything you want.

637
01:14:13,162 --> 01:14:16,256
Just... try... sir... you...
please help me, sir.

638
01:14:20,436 --> 01:14:22,267
Abhi. I don't want anyone's help.

639
01:14:24,440 --> 01:14:26,431
I will not sign any film which...

640
01:14:26,509 --> 01:14:29,103
...is based on your contacts
and recommendations.

641
01:14:33,649 --> 01:14:36,447
If i help you... will it be wrong?

642
01:14:37,386 --> 01:14:39,445
Wrong? No sir, why?

643
01:14:40,289 --> 01:14:43,281
Everyone wants someone's
help, isn't it, sir?

644
01:14:47,296 --> 01:14:48,456
Why doesn't she understand this?

645
01:14:49,298 --> 01:14:51,459
What, sir? I am sorry.

646
01:14:56,205 --> 01:14:57,399
Lakshmi. Meet me tomorrow.

647
01:14:57,606 --> 01:14:58,732
We will work something out.

648
01:14:59,475 --> 01:15:01,067
Really, sir?
- Yes.

649
01:15:01,510 --> 01:15:03,535
Thank you, sir. Thank
you so much sir.

650
01:15:03,612 --> 01:15:05,239
Bye, good night.

651
01:15:09,752 --> 01:15:11,083
Bye, sir.

652
01:15:11,487 --> 01:15:12,545
Hello, sir.

653
01:15:12,621 --> 01:15:13,679
Sir, my name is reva. I had...

654
01:15:13,756 --> 01:15:15,246
...talked to you over the
phone today morning.

655
01:15:16,425 --> 01:15:19,758
Reva...
- yes. - sit down. - thank you.

656
01:15:22,097 --> 01:15:24,258
What did i say after i heard
her voice on the phone?

657
01:15:24,433 --> 01:15:29,302
Yes? - What did i say?
- Yes sir. Yes. Sir.

658
01:15:29,371 --> 01:15:32,602
When her voice is so good,
now beautiful will she be?

659
01:15:34,443 --> 01:15:36,638
If the voice is good,
the girl is good too.

660
01:15:37,713 --> 01:15:39,578
Have you brought the photographs?
- No, sir.

661
01:15:39,648 --> 01:15:41,115
- Sir. I am a choreographer.

662
01:15:43,519 --> 01:15:45,384
You are star heroine material.

663
01:15:47,389 --> 01:15:52,292
Don't be so innocent
too. I can make.

664
01:15:55,664 --> 01:15:58,132
Heroine.
- Yes. Sir. Yes, sir.

665
01:16:00,469 --> 01:16:02,061
Cent percent.

666
01:16:08,244 --> 01:16:10,075
Sir, phone.
- I will talk later.

667
01:16:11,747 --> 01:16:13,237
Hey...

668
01:16:15,417 --> 01:16:17,351
how did that rajesh look when
he came the first time?

669
01:16:19,255 --> 01:16:21,086
Raju...

670
01:16:24,426 --> 01:16:26,087
body...

671
01:16:27,429 --> 01:16:29,090
you have a nice body.

672
01:16:31,267 --> 01:16:33,633
Have you learnt acting?

673
01:16:35,271 --> 01:16:38,263
I don't want to act.
I am a choreographer.

674
01:16:38,374 --> 01:16:41,104
I have heard that your film
needs a choreographer.

675
01:16:41,277 --> 01:16:43,268
I had talked to you
in the morning and...

676
01:16:43,379 --> 01:16:45,279
what are you talking about?
You are a heroine material.

677
01:16:45,347 --> 01:16:47,372
Why are you wasting yourself?

678
01:16:47,583 --> 01:16:53,283
There is no hurry. We will
know each other nicely.

679
01:16:53,389 --> 01:16:59,794
I have an office. Come there.
In the night.

680
01:17:00,529 --> 01:17:02,463
There is a room there.
There is an ac there.

681
01:17:02,598 --> 01:17:08,059
We will sit there
and speak... openly.

682
01:17:09,738 --> 01:17:11,069
You understand, don't you?

683
01:17:12,241 --> 01:17:14,072
Excuse me.

684
01:17:22,151 --> 01:17:25,484
Call kamla.
- Yes. Sir.

685
01:17:31,493 --> 01:17:33,085
Hey, is the shot ready?

686
01:17:34,163 --> 01:17:37,690
This is a balloon of blood.

687
01:17:40,502 --> 01:17:43,596
This is a balloon of blood.

688
01:17:46,842 --> 01:17:50,278
It wanders around day and night.

689
01:18:00,456 --> 01:18:03,220
This is a balloon of blood.

690
01:18:06,528 --> 01:18:11,397
It wanders around day and night.

691
01:18:13,635 --> 01:18:15,068
It wanders!

692
01:18:19,608 --> 01:18:23,237
People have called
it a vagabond.

693
01:18:26,515 --> 01:18:29,416
People with a heart have called
it a vagrant.

694
01:18:29,485 --> 01:18:35,287
Yet others have
called it an ember.

695
01:18:39,561 --> 01:18:42,496
People have called
it a vagabond.

696
01:18:42,631 --> 01:18:46,590
While the happy go lucky
have termed it as an ember.

697
01:18:49,605 --> 01:18:51,266
You and i have drunk.

698
01:18:52,574 --> 01:18:54,599
Drunk in happiness and sorrow.

699
01:18:58,280 --> 01:19:00,373
Friend... it is...

700
01:19:01,583 --> 01:19:06,213
a fountain!

701
01:19:09,224 --> 01:19:11,055
Dance...

702
01:19:12,061 --> 01:19:14,052
show us your dance.

703
01:19:15,330 --> 01:19:17,059
Beauty... dance...

704
01:19:18,600 --> 01:19:20,227
aroma... dance...

705
01:19:21,670 --> 01:19:23,069
dance... thunder...

706
01:19:25,240 --> 01:19:28,232
dance the dance of seduction.

707
01:19:29,578 --> 01:19:31,409
The poisonous dance.

708
01:19:32,581 --> 01:19:34,071
Dance...

709
01:19:37,419 --> 01:19:40,684
this is a balloon of blood.

710
01:19:52,434 --> 01:19:56,598
It sets afire to half the body.

711
01:19:59,174 --> 01:20:02,837
It makes the incomplete
mind insane.

712
01:20:05,647 --> 01:20:10,778
In the veins of breath,
it breaks it's life.

713
01:20:16,725 --> 01:20:23,130
In your heart, it disappears
my reflection.

714
01:20:31,673 --> 01:20:33,140
Dance.

715
01:20:34,309 --> 01:20:36,140
Dance unconscious.

716
01:20:37,546 --> 01:20:39,138
Dance restless.

717
01:20:40,816 --> 01:20:42,477
Dance without sadness.

718
01:20:43,752 --> 01:20:45,310
Dance exquisitely.

719
01:20:47,556 --> 01:20:52,493
Dance without customs.

720
01:20:53,662 --> 01:20:55,323
Poisonous dance.

721
01:20:57,566 --> 01:21:01,263
We are lost in your love.

722
01:21:02,504 --> 01:21:06,702
We are lost in your love.

723
01:21:08,443 --> 01:21:12,379
God made you. We are yours.

724
01:21:13,448 --> 01:21:17,509
We are lost in your love.

725
01:21:18,654 --> 01:21:22,715
We are lost in your love.

726
01:21:24,459 --> 01:21:28,395
God made you. We are yours.

727
01:21:29,398 --> 01:21:34,461
We are lost in your love.
- You look very handsome.

728
01:21:34,670 --> 01:21:39,300
We are lost in your love.

729
01:21:41,310 --> 01:21:43,141
Thanks.

730
01:21:46,315 --> 01:21:48,146
And how do i seem?

731
01:21:54,423 --> 01:21:56,152
Great.

732
01:21:56,692 --> 01:22:01,493
Fantastic. Superb.
You look anarkali's mother.

733
01:22:02,097 --> 01:22:06,090
Do i seem old?

734
01:22:06,268 --> 01:22:07,428
Sorry.

735
01:22:07,502 --> 01:22:09,094
You seem very beautiful.

736
01:22:09,771 --> 01:22:12,262
Okay, payal is throwing
a party today.

737
01:22:12,441 --> 01:22:13,567
Will you come with me?

738
01:22:14,443 --> 01:22:15,501
Payal, who?

739
01:22:15,577 --> 01:22:16,635
Payal... that socialite.

740
01:22:16,712 --> 01:22:18,509
I have heard, sir, richard
gere is coming there too.

741
01:22:18,647 --> 01:22:22,845
It will be fun. Promise.
Let's go. Please.

742
01:22:23,518 --> 01:22:25,110
Please... please... please...

743
01:22:35,731 --> 01:22:38,131
hello? - Hello, reva. Reva,
this is sandesh.

744
01:22:39,635 --> 01:22:41,125
Reva, i have a friend, diwakar.

745
01:22:42,204 --> 01:22:44,729
Shaan music industries?
The owner's son.

746
01:22:46,541 --> 01:22:48,475
He is a very intelligent man.

747
01:22:49,678 --> 01:22:51,475
He met me and he told me that...

748
01:22:51,546 --> 01:22:54,310
...he wants to make a music video.

749
01:22:54,683 --> 01:22:58,312
On the theme of dance.
I remembered you.

750
01:22:59,187 --> 01:23:02,679
Yes. I told him about you.
He wants to meet you.

751
01:23:26,648 --> 01:23:28,115
What is the meaning of doing...

752
01:23:28,183 --> 01:23:30,117
...something different
to seem different?

753
01:23:31,620 --> 01:23:33,611
I don't say that one
should be different.

754
01:23:34,122 --> 01:23:36,113
I am saying that one
should be right.

755
01:23:36,658 --> 01:23:38,717
Every song has its own tempo.

756
01:23:39,394 --> 01:23:41,123
Every dance has its own reason.

757
01:23:41,463 --> 01:23:43,522
We do not set this reason and tempo.

758
01:23:43,732 --> 01:23:46,132
The song itself decides
it and makes an identity.

759
01:23:46,301 --> 01:23:47,393
Just like that.

760
01:23:47,469 --> 01:23:49,130
Even your music video should...

761
01:23:49,204 --> 01:23:51,468
...have an identity too.
- What?

762
01:23:52,474 --> 01:23:54,874
To know this, we should know
the reason of the song first.

763
01:23:59,414 --> 01:24:02,247
Your thoughts... the
people will like it.

764
01:24:03,418 --> 01:24:05,079
What guarantee can you
give me about that?

765
01:24:10,092 --> 01:24:12,083
There is no guarantee for that.

766
01:24:22,604 --> 01:24:24,094
Your thoughts are very different.

767
01:24:36,284 --> 01:24:37,444
And ahead too.

768
01:24:39,654 --> 01:24:41,121
It is very ahead.

769
01:24:46,795 --> 01:24:48,456
I can't say that i understood...

770
01:24:48,530 --> 01:24:50,122
...fully what you are trying to say.

771
01:24:51,533 --> 01:24:53,524
But i can say...

772
01:24:53,602 --> 01:24:56,127
...that your thoughts and
respect for dance...

773
01:24:56,204 --> 01:25:00,800
...your understanding
is much more than me.

774
01:25:06,815 --> 01:25:08,077
Okay. Reva.

775
01:25:08,483 --> 01:25:10,075
Whatever you want to do...

776
01:25:10,152 --> 01:25:12,347
...however you want to
do it. Let's do it.

777
01:25:12,421 --> 01:25:15,618
The recording of the songs.
Music. Sets.

778
01:25:16,091 --> 01:25:18,082
Everything will be done
like how you want it.

779
01:25:18,260 --> 01:25:21,491
We will have rehearsals
and then shoot. Okay?

780
01:25:25,667 --> 01:25:27,100
Thank you.

781
01:26:28,830 --> 01:26:31,355
Reva, it is impossible for any
other girl than you to do this.

782
01:26:31,433 --> 01:26:33,264
I don't understand.
Means?

783
01:26:34,369 --> 01:26:36,428
I mean... you will have to
act in this music video.

784
01:26:36,605 --> 01:26:38,436
Absolutely. The expressions
that you are showing...

785
01:26:38,507 --> 01:26:40,441
...the type of dance
that you are doing...

786
01:26:40,509 --> 01:26:42,101
...from where will we bring all this?

787
01:26:42,277 --> 01:26:44,108
Whom will we bring to do all this?

788
01:26:45,447 --> 01:26:47,108
As it is, what is your problem?

789
01:26:47,649 --> 01:26:49,116
You wish that this music video...

790
01:26:49,184 --> 01:26:51,175
...should be just like
how you want it?

791
01:26:52,454 --> 01:26:56,288
That will be done when you
do it yourself. That's it.

792
01:27:29,484 --> 01:27:32,419
Dance and shake the world.

793
01:27:33,555 --> 01:27:37,753
Since so many years...
the whole world seems so still.

794
01:27:42,030 --> 01:27:46,091
Since so many years...
the whole world seems so still.

795
01:27:48,503 --> 01:27:52,439
There was thunder and lightning.
...from one thought so you...

796
01:27:56,511 --> 01:27:59,446
dance and shake the world.

797
01:28:00,849 --> 01:28:03,443
Dance and shake the world.

798
01:28:21,736 --> 01:28:23,397
Love... love...

799
01:28:23,471 --> 01:28:30,070
i have made you wear
the costume of love.

800
01:28:32,480 --> 01:28:33,811
It is fire. It is water.

801
01:28:33,882 --> 01:28:40,412
Whoever feels like...
can make it bow.

802
01:28:42,824 --> 01:28:44,416
Lift it with ambition.

803
01:28:44,492 --> 01:28:46,756
Bow the highest of storms.

804
01:28:46,828 --> 01:28:48,955
Lift it with ambition.

805
01:28:49,030 --> 01:28:52,431
Bow the highest of storms. You...

806
01:28:55,503 --> 01:28:57,767
dance and shake the world.

807
01:29:20,462 --> 01:29:24,398
All the directions
will start speaking.

808
01:29:24,799 --> 01:29:27,393
There will be a new sun rising.

809
01:29:35,010 --> 01:29:38,741
All the directions
will start speaking.

810
01:29:39,481 --> 01:29:41,813
There will be a new sun rising.

811
01:29:43,485 --> 01:29:45,419
There is a fire in these eyes.

812
01:29:45,487 --> 01:29:47,751
The one who touches them
will be set afire.

813
01:29:47,822 --> 01:29:49,414
There is a fire in these eyes.

814
01:29:49,491 --> 01:29:51,755
The one who touches them
will be set afire.

815
01:29:51,893 --> 01:29:53,952
There will be a word then.

816
01:29:54,029 --> 01:29:56,088
Melt the stone with the gaze.

817
01:29:56,498 --> 01:29:59,433
You... '

818
01:30:00,502 --> 01:30:02,436
dance and shake the world.

819
01:30:02,504 --> 01:30:04,438
Dance and shake the world.

820
01:30:04,839 --> 01:30:06,431
Show what your ambition is.

821
01:30:06,508 --> 01:30:08,772
Do something and show us.

822
01:30:08,843 --> 01:30:10,902
Which has been heard or seen.

823
01:30:10,979 --> 01:30:12,708
But it is different from
everything else.

824
01:30:12,781 --> 01:30:14,408
Just work your strength.

825
01:30:14,482 --> 01:30:16,712
Write a new history.

826
01:30:16,785 --> 01:30:19,379
Just work your strength.

827
01:30:19,454 --> 01:30:23,049
Write a new history. You.

828
01:30:25,460 --> 01:30:27,724
Dance and shake the world.

829
01:30:27,796 --> 01:30:29,388
Dance and shake the world.

830
01:30:29,464 --> 01:30:31,398
Dance and shake the world.

831
01:30:31,466 --> 01:30:33,730
Dance and shake the world.

832
01:30:33,802 --> 01:30:35,394
Raise the heads of ambition.

833
01:30:35,470 --> 01:30:37,802
Dance and shake the world.

834
01:30:37,872 --> 01:30:39,396
Bow the highest of storms.

835
01:30:39,474 --> 01:30:42,409
Dance and shake the world.

836
01:30:42,477 --> 01:30:44,411
Melt the stone with your eyes.

837
01:30:44,479 --> 01:30:46,413
Dance and shake the world.

838
01:30:46,481 --> 01:30:48,415
Show what your ambition is.

839
01:30:48,483 --> 01:30:50,417
Dance and shake the world.

840
01:30:50,485 --> 01:30:52,419
Show what your ambition is.

841
01:30:52,487 --> 01:30:54,751
Dance and shake the world.

842
01:30:56,825 --> 01:31:00,955
There was a fog and storm
from this thought.

843
01:31:01,029 --> 01:31:04,089
You...

844
01:31:07,502 --> 01:31:09,697
Iove and shake the world.

845
01:31:11,439 --> 01:31:13,703
Love and shake the world.

846
01:31:30,458 --> 01:31:31,789
Umeed singh says...

847
01:31:31,860 --> 01:31:35,057
if you are not mine, you
cannot be anyone's.

848
01:31:35,463 --> 01:31:38,728
He has tears in his eyes
and a gun in his hands.

849
01:31:38,800 --> 01:31:41,394
Focus in from his point of view.

850
01:31:41,469 --> 01:31:44,063
Nisha is standing in front
of him. With moist eyes.

851
01:31:44,472 --> 01:31:46,406
There is no way out.

852
01:31:48,476 --> 01:31:50,410
Superb.

853
01:31:51,479 --> 01:31:55,074
Sir... sir... sir... how
did you like it.

854
01:31:59,487 --> 01:32:01,421
I am sorry. I wasn't
hearing it properly.

855
01:32:03,491 --> 01:32:05,425
I was seeing the video, sorry.

856
01:32:05,493 --> 01:32:07,427
People make anything nowadays.

857
01:32:08,029 --> 01:32:09,428
Making something different...

858
01:32:11,833 --> 01:32:15,030
but i have heard that this
song is a super hit.

859
01:32:15,436 --> 01:32:17,370
The shaan music company was ruined.

860
01:32:17,438 --> 01:32:19,372
This song has done such business...

861
01:32:19,440 --> 01:32:21,840
...that their three year's
business is done.

862
01:32:23,444 --> 01:32:25,776
The music industry people
say anything.

863
01:32:26,447 --> 01:32:27,778
One song...

864
01:32:27,916 --> 01:32:31,374
if one song is hit... a
whole industry... no.

865
01:32:34,789 --> 01:32:37,383
Sir... will you please tell
me your scene once again?

866
01:32:37,458 --> 01:32:40,052
Okay. Umeed singh says...

867
01:32:40,461 --> 01:32:43,055
...if you cannot be mine,
you will be nobody's.

868
01:32:43,464 --> 01:32:46,058
His eyes are teary. And he
has a gun in his hands.

869
01:32:46,467 --> 01:32:48,731
A focus in with his point of view.

870
01:32:48,803 --> 01:32:51,067
Nisha is standing in his presence.
With moist eyes.

871
01:32:51,472 --> 01:32:54,407
There is no way out now. Music.

872
01:32:55,476 --> 01:32:57,808
A nice concept. A lot of hard work.

873
01:32:57,879 --> 01:33:00,404
And a lot of love for
music and dance.

874
01:33:00,481 --> 01:33:02,745
All this is seen in dance.

875
01:33:02,817 --> 01:33:04,876
This video has taken that leap...

876
01:33:04,953 --> 01:33:06,750
...of success that the
rest are all stunned.

877
01:33:06,821 --> 01:33:08,948
Many music videos have
achieved success...

878
01:33:09,023 --> 01:33:10,684
...but dance is something different.

879
01:33:10,758 --> 01:33:13,886
Choreographer reva
has become a star.

880
01:33:13,962 --> 01:33:17,363
Her fashion and style has taken
over the world overnight.

881
01:33:17,432 --> 01:33:19,696
Her dance 'naach naach ke duniya hila
de (dance and shake the world)'...

882
01:33:19,767 --> 01:33:22,099
...has actually made the world shake.

883
01:33:22,437 --> 01:33:26,373
We will see one scene.
Dance and shake the world.

884
01:33:28,443 --> 01:33:32,379
Since so many years...
the whole world seems so still.

885
01:33:43,791 --> 01:33:45,383
Hello?
- Hi, handsome.

886
01:33:45,727 --> 01:33:48,389
Hi, mamta. What are you doing?
- Nothing.

887
01:33:49,464 --> 01:33:51,728
Then, shall we do something? What?

888
01:33:52,467 --> 01:33:54,401
Anything. Like...

889
01:33:55,470 --> 01:33:56,801
we will go to dinner.

890
01:33:56,871 --> 01:33:59,066
Why? Is it something
special tonight? Hey.

891
01:33:59,474 --> 01:34:03,740
Super star abhinav... and the
super super star mamta...

892
01:34:04,812 --> 01:34:08,077
they are going for dinner. What
can be more special than this?

893
01:34:09,884 --> 01:34:13,342
Okay. People think that putting
four songs make a musical.

894
01:34:15,423 --> 01:34:16,549
But we haven't been able to make...

895
01:34:16,624 --> 01:34:18,353
...a musical in the true
sense of the word.

896
01:34:19,427 --> 01:34:21,361
And looking at our
video's response...

897
01:34:22,430 --> 01:34:25,888
...i think that the audience
is ready for such a musical.

898
01:34:27,435 --> 01:34:31,030
Ya. And a special actor is
needed for such a film.

899
01:34:33,441 --> 01:34:35,909
Behind the lecture, what
i want to say is...

900
01:34:36,778 --> 01:34:38,370
i want to make a musical.

901
01:34:40,448 --> 01:34:42,382
With you.

902
01:34:43,451 --> 01:34:45,385
Hey... diwakar...

903
01:34:46,454 --> 01:34:48,388
hi, abhi.

904
01:34:59,467 --> 01:35:01,401
I saw your video.

905
01:35:02,804 --> 01:35:04,396
What should i say?

906
01:35:09,877 --> 01:35:12,345
It was very nice.
- Thanks.

907
01:35:12,413 --> 01:35:15,678
Abhi... why don't you join us?

908
01:35:24,425 --> 01:35:26,359
We have a booking in an
italian restaurant.

909
01:35:26,761 --> 01:35:28,353
We should get going.

910
01:35:30,431 --> 01:35:32,365
Enjoy your meal.

911
01:35:38,773 --> 01:35:42,368
Really nice guy.
- Yes.

912
01:35:42,710 --> 01:35:45,838
Abhi... what does she think she is?

913
01:35:45,913 --> 01:35:49,041
A song has gone a hit
and she is flying.

914
01:35:56,991 --> 01:35:59,391
Mamta... i want to go. What?

915
01:36:00,461 --> 01:36:02,395
You are joking.

916
01:36:02,797 --> 01:36:04,389
And dinner?

917
01:36:06,467 --> 01:36:08,401
No. I am going.

918
01:36:09,404 --> 01:36:13,670
For god's sake, abhi. Abhi! Abhi!

919
01:37:06,994 --> 01:37:08,393
Reva...

920
01:37:08,796 --> 01:37:10,388
you are very special.

921
01:37:15,470 --> 01:37:17,404
If you weren't there... this...

922
01:37:17,472 --> 01:37:19,406
can't we stop these formalities?

923
01:37:22,810 --> 01:37:25,074
Okay. If you weren't there...

924
01:37:26,881 --> 01:37:29,076
come on. We will stop
praising each other.

925
01:37:30,017 --> 01:37:34,078
Seriously, reva. Thank you.

926
01:37:37,825 --> 01:37:39,417
For being reva.

927
01:37:40,895 --> 01:37:43,090
Good night.
- Good night.

928
01:37:59,514 --> 01:38:01,914
Hi. Hi.

929
01:38:05,052 --> 01:38:06,451
Can i come inside?

930
01:38:29,477 --> 01:38:31,411
Nice place.

931
01:38:32,813 --> 01:38:34,405
Want some coffee?

932
01:38:50,031 --> 01:38:52,761
Congrats. For what?

933
01:38:55,903 --> 01:38:58,098
The people have liked your video.

934
01:38:59,507 --> 01:39:01,441
And...

935
01:39:02,510 --> 01:39:04,774
you have done all this
in your own way.

936
01:39:04,845 --> 01:39:10,044
Like how you were saying.
Yes. Congrats.

937
01:39:13,454 --> 01:39:15,388
You have said it.

938
01:39:16,457 --> 01:39:18,391
I know... i...

939
01:39:19,860 --> 01:39:21,384
i wanted to say it once
again. That's all.

940
01:39:34,008 --> 01:39:35,407
Reva... i love you.

941
01:39:44,018 --> 01:39:46,077
I committed a mistake that day.

942
01:39:48,956 --> 01:39:53,086
Can't we just forget whatever
happened that day?

943
01:40:01,502 --> 01:40:03,902
Hello, diwakar. Hi, reva!

944
01:40:04,505 --> 01:40:06,439
That writer is coming
to the office...

945
01:40:06,507 --> 01:40:08,441
...at eleven in the morning,
to tell the story.

946
01:40:08,909 --> 01:40:10,376
Yes, okay. I will reach there.

947
01:40:10,444 --> 01:40:11,911
Is that okay? Sure.

948
01:40:11,979 --> 01:40:14,038
Okay. I will see you tomorrow.
- Bye.

949
01:40:27,461 --> 01:40:29,395
Reva... i...

950
01:40:38,739 --> 01:40:40,400
go, abhi.

951
01:40:43,477 --> 01:40:45,411
I think you should leave.

952
01:41:43,804 --> 01:41:45,396
Sir, phone.

953
01:41:53,481 --> 01:41:55,745
Hello? What do you think
you are, abhi?

954
01:41:56,817 --> 01:41:58,409
How could you do like this?

955
01:41:58,486 --> 01:42:00,886
Mamta, not right now. What do
you mean by not right now?

956
01:42:01,489 --> 01:42:05,755
If you act like this...
- what? - then... we...

957
01:42:06,494 --> 01:42:07,825
we?

958
01:42:08,829 --> 01:42:14,028
Mamta... we were working
on a film together.

959
01:42:15,436 --> 01:42:18,371
That film is over now.
There is no we.

960
01:42:20,441 --> 01:42:22,841
If we get a chance to work
together again, we'll see.

961
01:42:23,911 --> 01:42:25,378
Okay?

962
01:42:25,980 --> 01:42:27,379
I hate you.

963
01:42:29,450 --> 01:42:31,384
I am sorry.

964
01:42:42,463 --> 01:42:44,397
As an answer, shekhar looks at her.

965
01:42:44,465 --> 01:42:46,399
But he doesn't say anything.

966
01:42:46,467 --> 01:42:49,868
Even shweta looks at him.
Just looks at him.

967
01:42:50,471 --> 01:42:53,872
And then she too walks away
not saying anything. Than end.

968
01:42:59,747 --> 01:43:01,408
It's fantastic.

969
01:43:04,485 --> 01:43:06,419
Who is doing the role of shekhar?

970
01:43:08,889 --> 01:43:12,017
I think that abhi will be
perfect for this role.

971
01:43:14,895 --> 01:43:16,362
Perfect choice.

972
01:43:24,705 --> 01:43:26,832
Do you think that i will
be able to do this role?

973
01:43:30,444 --> 01:43:32,378
What else can my coming here means?

974
01:43:45,459 --> 01:43:49,054
And... what about the rest
of your team? - Team?

975
01:43:52,466 --> 01:43:54,400
Yes.

976
01:43:55,803 --> 01:43:58,067
Your cameraman. Writer.

977
01:44:00,741 --> 01:44:02,402
Reva and the others.

978
01:44:03,744 --> 01:44:06,406
All of them think that you
are good for this role.

979
01:44:07,481 --> 01:44:09,415
And reva thinks that there isn't
anyone better for this role than you.

980
01:44:15,890 --> 01:44:17,357
Professional.

981
01:44:17,424 --> 01:44:19,358
There should be intoxication.

982
01:44:19,426 --> 01:44:21,360
There should be intoxication.

983
01:44:25,432 --> 01:44:28,697
There should be fun.
There should be fun.

984
01:44:28,769 --> 01:44:32,762
There should be breeze.
There should be breeze.

985
01:44:32,840 --> 01:44:36,037
There should be smoke.
There should be smoke.

986
01:44:40,781 --> 01:44:43,375
This life is colourless.

987
01:44:51,926 --> 01:44:55,384
This life is colourless,
i want a companion.

988
01:44:55,462 --> 01:44:59,398
This life is so slow,
a speed is needed.

989
01:44:59,466 --> 01:45:03,732
I want to become crazy, live
and die in this love.

990
01:45:03,804 --> 01:45:07,399
I want to become crazy, live
and die in this love.

991
01:45:07,474 --> 01:45:12,002
I just want love and music.
Colourless.

992
01:45:18,819 --> 01:45:22,346
This life is colourless,
i want a companion.

993
01:45:22,690 --> 01:45:26,353
This life is so slow,
it needs a pace.

994
01:45:26,427 --> 01:45:30,363
I want to go crazy, live
and die in this love.

995
01:45:30,431 --> 01:45:34,367
I want to go crazy, the
desire of some heart.

996
01:45:34,435 --> 01:45:37,370
Everyone should stop and stare.
I just want a beloved like that.

997
01:45:37,905 --> 01:45:39,372
Colourless.

998
01:46:07,468 --> 01:46:09,663
Life... life is not life...

999
01:46:10,871 --> 01:46:13,999
the one that doesn't have love.

1000

Life... life is not life...

1001

the one that doesn't have love.

1002

'Let the heart love, let the
heartbeat come closer.

1003
01:46:29,423 --> 01:46:31,357
The one that doesn't have love.

1004
01:46:31,425 --> 01:46:33,757
'Let the heart love, let the
heartbeat come closer.

1005
01:46:33,827 --> 01:46:37,024
There is silence, i need
rhythm in this silence.

1006
01:46:37,431 --> 01:46:39,365
Colurless.

1007
01:46:41,435 --> 01:46:44,700
This life is colourless,
i want a companion.

1008
01:46:45,439 --> 01:46:48,704
This life is so slow,
a speed is needed.

1009
01:47:12,800 --> 01:47:15,394
The breaths are going on but...

1010
01:47:16,470 --> 01:47:19,405
where am i living here?

1011
01:47:23,744 --> 01:47:26,406
The breaths are going on but...

1012
01:47:27,614 --> 01:47:30,412
where am i living here?

1013

Let me have fun, let
the heart become hard.

Let me have fun, let
the heart become hard.

This life is so slow,
a speed is needed.

1020
01:47:58,045 --> 01:48:02,038
I want to become crazy, the
ambition of some heart.

1021

I want to become crazy, live
and die in this love.

'Colourless.

1024

You are very good.

1025
01:48:40,487 --> 01:48:42,421
And i was very bad.

1026
01:48:42,756 --> 01:48:45,418
That's not true. You were good too.

1027
01:48:49,830 --> 01:48:52,094
Reva, don't you think
that abhi worked well?

1028
01:48:52,766 --> 01:48:54,427
You were good, abhi.

1029
01:48:56,503 --> 01:48:58,437
In fact, you were very good.

1030
01:49:02,509 --> 01:49:04,443
And you too.

1031
01:49:05,846 --> 01:49:08,440
Mahesh must be waiting in
the office. We will go.

1032
01:49:13,453 --> 01:49:15,387
Bye. Abhi.

1033
01:49:40,013 --> 01:49:42,072
I haven't seen a talent
like reva before this.

1034
01:49:42,482 --> 01:49:47,749
And... as a director i feel
lucky that reva is with me.

1035
01:49:53,493 --> 01:49:55,427
Mr. Diwakar had faith me.

1036
01:49:56,830 --> 01:49:59,094
Is anything else needed to be said?

1037
01:50:11,778 --> 01:50:13,370
Diwakar. Abhi...

1038
01:50:13,981 --> 01:50:16,711
i was thinking about the goa song...

1039
01:50:16,783 --> 01:50:18,375
i was seeing you on television now.

1040
01:50:20,787 --> 01:50:23,915
You... were speaking about reva.

1041
01:50:23,991 --> 01:50:25,720
Oh, that!

1042
01:50:26,460 --> 01:50:27,791
That is the truth, abhi.

1043
01:50:27,928 --> 01:50:30,396
An artiste like reva doesn't
come everyday in life.

1044
01:50:31,465 --> 01:50:33,399
I know that.

1045
01:50:34,468 --> 01:50:36,732
As i was saying... when we
will go for that song...

1046
01:50:36,803 --> 01:50:40,398
...there will be a lot of people
and a lot of things...

1047
01:50:40,474 --> 01:50:41,805
diwakar...

1048
01:50:41,875 --> 01:50:45,072
we will take later, i am busy. Okay?

1049
01:51:05,499 --> 01:51:07,763
Hi. Hey, bring the chair. No.

1050
01:51:10,904 --> 01:51:12,701
I'm sorry.
- Why?

1051
01:51:13,774 --> 01:51:16,038
Because, i was rude on
the phone yesterday.

1052
01:51:16,977 --> 01:51:19,377
That's okay. Perhaps, you were busy.

1053
01:51:22,916 --> 01:51:27,046
Yes, i was. Still, i shouldn't
have done that.

1054
01:51:35,462 --> 01:51:37,396
Hi.
- Hello.

1055
01:51:40,934 --> 01:51:43,061
Anyway, sorry to disturb.

1056
01:51:54,014 --> 01:51:57,074
Is there something between
both of... - nothing.

1057
01:51:57,484 --> 01:51:59,952
Sir, there is this rumour in the
market regarding your price.

1058
01:52:00,821 --> 01:52:02,413
So, what would you like
to say about it?

1059
01:52:03,824 --> 01:52:05,951
What shall i say?
It's just a rumour.

1060
01:52:06,026 --> 01:52:07,425
But, the rumour is same, sir.

1061
01:52:09,496 --> 01:52:11,691
You asked a question
and i replied to it.

1062
01:52:11,765 --> 01:52:13,357
Sir, look, we journalists
very well know...

1063
01:52:13,433 --> 01:52:16,698
...as to how much is the
reality behind a rumour.

1064
01:52:17,437 --> 01:52:20,702
Forget it. Who's the
heroine in this film?

1065
01:52:25,779 --> 01:52:28,043
Reva. Reva!?

1066
01:52:28,715 --> 01:52:30,376
Is she the same video album girl?

1067
01:52:31,451 --> 01:52:33,385
She dances quite good, sir.

1068
01:52:34,988 --> 01:52:38,048
But, sir, what do you feel? Will
she able to act the same way?

1069
01:52:39,459 --> 01:52:40,721
Why are you asking this to me?

1070
01:52:40,794 --> 01:52:42,386
Better ask the director
and the producer.

1071
01:52:42,462 --> 01:52:44,396
As they are the ones who
signed her, and not me.

1072
01:52:44,731 --> 01:52:46,392
You said it right, sir.

1073
01:52:47,734 --> 01:52:50,066
I'll find out about
reva from diwakar.

1074
01:52:51,805 --> 01:52:53,397
You know, sir...

1075
01:52:54,474 --> 01:52:56,408
reva's affair with diwakar...

1076
01:52:57,477 --> 01:52:59,411
in a way it's a rumour, sir.
- What?

1077
01:52:59,479 --> 01:53:01,743
You know... there's this
rumour in the market...

1078
01:53:03,483 --> 01:53:05,417
you might be aware of it, sir.

1079
01:53:05,485 --> 01:53:07,419
What are you doing? You're
hitting a journalist!

1080
01:53:07,487 --> 01:53:08,749
Do you know what it means?
- What did you say?

1081
01:53:08,822 --> 01:53:11,017
I'll sue you in the court. Abhi!
Abhi! I won't leave you! - Get out!

1082
01:53:11,425 --> 01:53:13,359
You're hitting, right?
- Get out!

1083
01:53:13,427 --> 01:53:14,689
Abhi, just stop it!

1084
01:53:14,761 --> 01:53:16,353
Abhi, is this the way to handle it?

1085
01:53:17,431 --> 01:53:19,365
You don't know anything!
So, don't intervene!

1086
01:53:27,441 --> 01:53:28,908
Abhi! I'll see you!

1087
01:53:28,975 --> 01:53:30,704
Just watch tomorrow's paper!

1088
01:53:30,777 --> 01:53:33,371
You freak out like a big star!
Just watch tomorrow's paper!

1089
01:54:27,434 --> 01:54:28,696
Where is mr. Diwakar?

1090
01:54:28,768 --> 01:54:30,360
He's inside. In the make-up van.

1091
01:54:30,437 --> 01:54:32,371
Along with miss reva.

1092
01:54:40,447 --> 01:54:42,381
Give this to him.

1093
01:54:42,449 --> 01:54:44,383
Okay, sir.

1094
01:55:05,472 --> 01:55:08,407
It's the heat of love!

1095
01:55:12,812 --> 01:55:17,010
Life gets heated up if it
feels the heat of love.

1096
01:55:20,420 --> 01:55:24,686
The colour of love is bright; so
the eyes turn bright as well.

1097
01:55:25,959 --> 01:55:29,690
The craze hits so as.
The heart clinks like an anklet.

1098
01:55:29,763 --> 01:55:32,357
And, the drive goes all haywire.

1099
01:55:33,767 --> 01:55:38,033
Life gets heated up if it
feels the heat of love.

1100

01:55:54,454 --> 01:55:56,388
It's the heat of love!

1104
01:55:58,458 --> 01:56:02,394
Life gets heated up if it
feels the heat of love.

1105
01:56:38,431 --> 01:56:41,366
Love! Love! Love!
Is all that we've got to do.

1106
01:56:42,435 --> 01:56:45,370
Love is fire.
And, we've to go through.

1107
01:56:49,776 --> 01:56:53,041
Love! Love! Love!
Is all that we've got to do.

1108
01:56:53,446 --> 01:56:56,381
There's no limit.
And, we've to go through.

1109
01:56:56,783 --> 01:56:59,377
Even if there are blues in life.

1110
01:57:00,453 --> 01:57:04,719
And, hence it turns all crusty.

1111
01:57:07,927 --> 01:57:09,724
It's the heat of love!

Life gets heated up if it
feels the heat of love.

1116
01:58:10,924 --> 01:58:13,722
The gaze writhes and gets
locked as it's affected.

1117
01:58:14,794 --> 01:58:17,388
And, there's no idea; when
or where might it get locked.

1118
01:58:22,469 --> 01:58:25,404
The gaze writhes and gets

01:59:30,804 --> 01:59:33,068
Mahesh, tell abhi that
the shot is ready.

1132
01:59:33,473 --> 01:59:35,407
Sir, he went away.

1133
01:59:35,475 --> 01:59:36,737
Went away? Where?

1134
01:59:36,810 --> 01:59:38,402
The production guys say that
he has gone to mumbai.

1135
01:59:40,480 --> 01:59:42,414
Mumbai?

1136
01:59:59,032 --> 02:00:01,762
Sir... diwakar-ji has
come to meet you.

1137
02:00:18,785 --> 02:00:20,377
Hi, abhi.

1138
02:00:30,463 --> 02:00:32,397
How are you?

1139
02:00:38,805 --> 02:00:41,069
Abhi, i don't even know as to
what's happening between us.

1140
02:00:43,476 --> 02:00:44,807
If there's some misunderstanding,
then...

1141
02:00:44,878 --> 02:00:47,073
diwakar, i don't want
to do your film.

1142
02:00:53,486 --> 02:00:56,421
Don't ask me the reason.
I won't do the film.

1143
02:01:00,960 --> 02:01:04,418
And, whatever your losses are...

1144
02:01:04,497 --> 02:01:06,431
...tell them to me,
and i'll reimburse.

1145
02:02:36,789 --> 02:02:39,053
How can you be this unprofessional,
abhi?

1146
02:02:47,734 --> 02:02:49,395
Abhi, i did tell you before.

1147
02:02:49,535 --> 02:02:52,402
That our profession is on one hand.
And, we're on the other.

1148
02:02:52,472 --> 02:02:54,406
So, don't mix them up.

1149
02:02:54,807 --> 02:02:59,801
And, i also told you, reva,
that i'm not great like you.

1150
02:02:59,879 --> 02:03:01,403
Abhi, don't ridicule me!

1151
02:03:01,481 --> 02:03:03,415
I'm not ridiculing.

1152
02:03:05,485 --> 02:03:07,749
Do you want to know, why i
don't want to do your film?

1153
02:03:09,956 --> 02:03:12,015
I love reva very much.

1154
02:03:14,560 --> 02:03:16,357
Since, always.

1155
02:03:21,701 --> 02:03:23,362
She was everything to me.

1156
02:03:25,438 --> 02:03:27,372
And, one day i lost her.

1157
02:03:30,443 --> 02:03:34,379
In the beginning i used
to think; so what?

1158
02:03:36,783 --> 02:03:38,375
I can live without reva.

1159
02:03:40,453 --> 02:03:42,387
But, i was wrong.

1160
02:03:50,463 --> 02:03:52,397
You were right.

1161
02:03:57,470 --> 02:03:59,404
It was my fault and...

1162
02:03:59,472 --> 02:04:01,406
now, i've to bear for it.

1163
02:04:04,010 --> 02:04:06,069
I cannot live without you, reva.

1164
02:04:15,421 --> 02:04:17,355
But, i can understand this.

1165
02:04:24,430 --> 02:04:26,364
Diwakar is the right person for you.

1166
02:04:26,966 --> 02:04:29,628
He understands you. And,
he has supported you.

1167
02:04:31,971 --> 02:04:35,031
But, this understanding
means nothing to me.

1168
02:04:38,711 --> 02:04:41,373
Because, i don't find
a solution for myself.

1169
02:04:51,457 --> 02:04:52,719
The space that i've
for you in my heart...

1170
02:04:52,792 --> 02:04:54,384
...what should i do with that?

1171
02:04:58,464 --> 02:05:00,398
I can do nothing.

1172
02:05:05,872 --> 02:05:09,399
I'm getting insane day by day
as i see you both together.

1173
02:05:11,410 --> 02:05:13,344
I'm unable to bear it!

1174
02:05:17,416 --> 02:05:19,350
And, this has an effect
on my profession.

1175
02:05:19,418 --> 02:05:21,352
I'm unable to do anything right!

1176
02:05:22,421 --> 02:05:23,683
I know...

1177
02:05:23,756 --> 02:05:26,350
i know, reva, that this film
will ruin because of me!

1178
02:05:29,428 --> 02:05:31,692
So, before it is too late,
i've decided that...

1179
02:05:31,764 --> 02:05:33,356
...i'm opting out of this film.

1180
02:05:34,967 --> 02:05:37,697
Do you know, diwakar, that i...

1181
02:05:37,770 --> 02:05:41,035
...always told reva that i want
loads of money and fame.

1182
02:05:44,977 --> 02:05:47,036
I've earned everything
and i'm not happy.

1183
02:05:59,458 --> 02:06:01,392
And, that is because...

1184
02:06:03,462 --> 02:06:05,396
...my happiness lies in you, reva.

1185
02:06:08,467 --> 02:06:10,332
And, you're not near to me.

1186
02:06:20,413 --> 02:06:22,347
Now, i don't want anything.

1187
02:06:23,416 --> 02:06:26,749
Neither film nor money. Nothing.

1188
02:06:26,819 --> 02:06:28,343
I just want to go back.

1189
02:06:29,422 --> 02:06:31,356
I want to go back.

1190
02:06:43,769 --> 02:06:45,361
That's it.

1191
02:06:46,772 --> 02:06:48,364
And, i'm very sorry.

1192
02:06:57,850 --> 02:07:01,047
Abhi, when we met...

1193
02:07:04,924 --> 02:07:09,054
...you were able to
see me the way i'm.

1194
02:07:12,465 --> 02:07:14,399
And, this was the very reason
for your love with me.

1195
02:07:16,802 --> 02:07:19,066
And i love you because.

1196
02:07:21,741 --> 02:07:24,403
And, you were able to understand...

1197
02:07:24,477 --> 02:07:28,937
...everything about me, that
others were unable to.

1198
02:07:31,951 --> 02:07:33,418
But, that day...

1199
02:07:33,819 --> 02:07:36,413
...that day, in your car...

1200
02:07:40,493 --> 02:07:42,427
that day, it was your success
that was doing the talking.

1201
02:07:44,830 --> 02:07:48,823
And then the other day, when
you came home to wish...

1202
02:07:48,901 --> 02:07:52,098
...that day as well your success
did all the talking.

1203
02:07:54,774 --> 02:07:57,436
Whatever you said that day,
it was because...

1204
02:07:57,510 --> 02:08:01,776
...you were successful in
the eyes of the people.

1205
02:08:03,516 --> 02:08:05,450
But, today...

1206
02:08:09,455 --> 02:08:11,719
today, i can see the
same abhi, who...

1207
02:08:16,796 --> 02:08:19,060
...saw me in the bus that day.

1208
02:08:23,469 --> 02:08:25,403
Diwakar...

1209
02:08:25,471 --> 02:08:28,736
diwakar wants to work with
me because of my talent.

1210
02:08:29,475 --> 02:08:31,409
And, there's nothing between
us other than that.

1211
02:08:40,486 --> 02:08:42,420
In fact, i was just waiting
for you, abhi.

1212
02:08:45,024 --> 02:08:50,758
And, if you had gone away
without saying all this...

1213
02:08:50,830 --> 02:08:55,096
...then too, i would have
only waited for you.

1214
02:08:56,502 --> 02:08:58,436
Forever.

1215
02:09:05,845 --> 02:09:07,437
Do you want to say that...

1216
02:09:07,980 --> 02:09:10,039
...you still love me?

1217
02:09:12,451 --> 02:09:14,385
What else?

1218
02:09:29,468 --> 02:09:31,402
I'm... i'm sorry.

1219
02:09:33,472 --> 02:09:35,406
I misunderstood you.

1220
02:09:35,474 --> 02:09:37,408
Oh, i'm stupid!

1221
02:09:40,012 --> 02:09:42,071
You didn't misunderstand
me entirely.

1222
02:09:44,950 --> 02:09:48,408
It's true that i'm working
with her because of talent.

1223
02:09:50,756 --> 02:09:54,419
But, it's true as well
that i love you.

1224
02:09:56,762 --> 02:09:58,957
It's just that i was looking
for a chance to express...

1225
02:09:59,498 --> 02:10:01,432
and, now...

1226
02:10:03,502 --> 02:10:05,766
abhi, if i say that
i'm happy for you...

1227
02:10:06,505 --> 02:10:08,439
...then, i would be a liar.

1228
02:10:08,507 --> 02:10:09,701
Yes.

1229
02:10:09,842 --> 02:10:13,039
But, i'm very much happy for reva.

1230
02:10:13,779 --> 02:10:17,044
Because, reva should get
that all she longs for.

1231
02:10:21,053 --> 02:10:22,384
And, she longs for you.

1232
02:10:29,795 --> 02:10:31,387
Congrats, reva.

1233
02:10:32,865 --> 02:10:35,390
And, abhi, we'll meet
tomorrow on the shoot.

1234
02:10:37,470 --> 02:10:39,404
See you tomorrow. Bye.

1235
02:10:46,479 --> 02:10:48,413
Diwakar...

1236
02:10:49,081 --> 02:10:50,412
reva?

1237
02:10:53,486 --> 02:10:55,420
I never felt the need to say.

1238
02:10:57,957 --> 02:10:59,424
Thank you.

1239
02:11:02,495 --> 02:11:04,429
Thank you too.

1240
02:11:30,456 --> 02:11:32,390
You okay?

1241
02:11:35,461 --> 02:11:37,395
Great.

1242
02:11:37,463 --> 02:11:39,931
Fantastic. Superb.
