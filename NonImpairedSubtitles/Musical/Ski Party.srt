what's that?

484
00:22:38,657 --> 00:22:40,192
Sounded like
girls laughing.

485
00:22:40,225 --> 00:22:42,627
We must be near
the swiss border.

486
00:22:42,661 --> 00:22:45,630
Now we are going to learn how to do the snowplow.

487
00:22:45,664 --> 00:22:47,599
First we pick up
our poles this way

488
00:22:47,632 --> 00:22:49,201
and we bend
our knees

489
00:22:49,234 --> 00:22:51,470
and point our inner edges in,
this way.

490
00:22:51,503 --> 00:22:53,805
Bend your knees
and bob up and down.

[Girls laughing]

ah.

493
00:23:00,645 --> 00:23:02,547
This must be
the place.

494
00:23:02,581 --> 00:23:03,715
Yeah, slope 6.

495
00:23:03,749 --> 00:23:04,883
[Todd]
oh, boy.

496
00:23:04,916 --> 00:23:07,652
Craig, now that's the
way to learn how to ski.

497
00:23:07,686 --> 00:23:09,654
Nice and easy
and slow.

498
00:23:09,955 --> 00:23:12,591
Yeah. Yeah, it's too
bad we're not girls.

499
00:23:12,624 --> 00:23:16,061
You know, a few lessons here,
in the basic fundamentals

500
00:23:16,094 --> 00:23:18,497
and we'd be able to clobber freddie,
like that!

501
00:23:18,530 --> 00:23:20,265
You really think we could catch on that fast?

502
00:23:20,298 --> 00:23:21,500
Are you
kidding?

503
00:23:21,533 --> 00:23:22,734
We're
natural athletes.

504
00:23:22,768 --> 00:23:23,802
We are?

505
00:23:23,835 --> 00:23:25,303
I've got a
great idea.

506
00:23:25,337 --> 00:23:26,304
Just a second.

507
00:23:26,338 --> 00:23:27,672
What're you
gonna do now?

508
00:23:27,706 --> 00:23:29,007
I'll spell "help"
in the snow.

513
00:23:51,797 --> 00:23:53,865
I can't. I
just had lunch.

514
00:24:01,206 --> 00:24:02,607
All right,
now, look.

515
00:24:02,641 --> 00:24:04,342
If we don't
disguise our voices,

516
00:24:04,376 --> 00:24:05,977
we'll never pull
it off, old girl.

the girl's ski class is on slope 6.

we're girls--

00:37:40,958 --> 00:37:43,928
i was straightening out 2 english
girls about american boys.

806
00:37:43,961 --> 00:37:45,329
You were?

807
00:37:45,363 --> 00:37:46,931
Yeah, i was going
to tell them more

808
00:37:46,964 --> 00:37:48,466
as soon as we get back to the lodge.

809
00:37:48,499 --> 00:37:50,368
I see. Then you'll
probably give them

810
00:37:50,401 --> 00:37:52,003
the rest of the
scoop tomorrow, huh?

811
00:37:52,036 --> 00:37:53,871
Well, actually,
i was going to invite them

812
00:37:53,904 --> 00:37:55,306
up to our
room for cocoa

813
00:37:55,339 --> 00:37:56,340
after the
sleigh ride,

814
00:37:56,374 --> 00:37:58,376
but i don't know
where they live.

815
00:37:58,409 --> 00:38:00,378
Oh, well, uh,
if i see them,

816
00:38:00,411 --> 00:38:01,946
i'll, uh,
i'll tell them to drop over.

817
00:38:01,979 --> 00:38:04,515
Oh, great. They were
really lots of fun.

818
00:38:05,383 --> 00:38:07,418
More than
craig and me?

819
00:38:09,553 --> 00:38:11,422
In a different way.

836
00:38:53,631 --> 00:38:56,667
we never want
to let 'em go

837
00:38:56,701 --> 00:38:59,403

00:39:05,543 --> 00:39:07,878
maybe we should
forget about 'em

843
00:39:08,412 --> 00:39:10,881
maybe we should
say goodbye

844
00:39:10,915 --> 00:39:14,385
what would we
ever do without 'em?

845

Hot cocoa,

Oh, just what i need
on a cold night.

Me, too.
I'm freezing.

You look warm.

883
00:40:43,541 --> 00:40:45,943
Sure you wouldn't be more
comfortable with that bathrobe off?

884
00:40:45,976 --> 00:40:47,511
Yes, why don't
you take it off?

885

No! No! No, i'm just fine.
Thank you.

Hey, listen,
speaking of dumb boys,

887
00:40:53,751 --> 00:40:56,554
did i tell you about the time i
taught craig gamble a lesson

888
00:40:56,587 --> 00:40:58,789
for arriving late
on our first date?

889
00:40:58,823 --> 00:41:02,626
No, but we're just dying to hear,
aren't we, nora?

00:41:02,660 --> 00:41:03,727
Just dying.

891
00:41:04,995 --> 00:41:08,132
Well, we were parked up on mulholland drive,
in the dark

892
00:41:08,165 --> 00:41:10,568
and he decided
he had to kiss me.

893
00:41:10,601 --> 00:41:11,569
What did
you say?

894
00:41:11,602 --> 00:41:13,804
[Barbara]
i said no, naturally.

895
00:41:13,838 --> 00:41:15,573
Boy, that kinsey
was some liar.

896
00:41:16,006 --> 00:41:17,541
What happened?

897
00:41:17,575 --> 00:41:20,077
Well, first of all,
he locked all the car doors

898
00:41:20,110 --> 00:41:21,879
and then he
tried to tie my arms

899
00:41:21,912 --> 00:41:24,014
behind my back
with my hair ribbon.

900
00:41:25,049 --> 00:41:26,750
So, i
fixed him.

901
00:41:26,784 --> 00:41:27,818
I let him
kiss me.

902
00:41:27,852 --> 00:41:29,587
That's
getting even?

903
00:41:29,620 --> 00:41:32,022
I had a cigarette in my mouth at the time.

904
00:41:32,056 --> 00:41:33,591
[Laughing]

905
00:41:34,792 --> 00:41:37,628
and his nose and his chin,
and his eyebrows

906
00:41:39,597 --> 00:41:42,733
so, it turned out to be a very passionate kiss.

907
00:41:43,801 --> 00:41:45,769
Oh, you know, boys
are all right.

908
00:41:45,803 --> 00:41:48,572
You just have to watch them every minute.
That's all.

909
00:41:48,606 --> 00:41:51,876
Why, just tonight,
todd tried to put his arm around me.

910
00:41:52,710 --> 00:41:54,545
What happened?

911
00:41:54,578 --> 00:41:57,748

nice-looking boy with only one arm?

913

[Janet]
is he all right now?

915
00:42:04,788 --> 00:42:07,791
Oh, yes,
he's coming back to school next semester

that is,
if his parole comes through in time.

including me,

1288
01:00:01,297 --> 01:00:03,466
has seen you for
the past 24 hours

1289
01:00:03,499 --> 01:00:07,804
and 7 people saw nora go in and
out of your room 4 times today.

1290
01:00:07,837 --> 01:00:08,838
No--

1291
01:00:08,871 --> 01:00:12,008
oh, oh, the little,
uh, english girl.

1292
01:00:12,041 --> 01:00:14,477
She's there right now,
isn't she, in your room?

1293
01:00:14,510 --> 01:00:16,646
And she went
in at 4:15.

1294
01:00:16,679 --> 01:00:19,649
Look, can i help it if todd and i dig european women?

1295
01:00:19,983 --> 01:00:22,719
And linda and i
were so nice to them.

1296
01:00:25,755 --> 01:00:27,657
Well, what are you
so happy about?

1297
01:00:27,690 --> 01:00:29,525
Are you kidding?
You heard barbara.

1298
01:00:29,559 --> 01:00:31,494
I'm having a big
scene with myself.

1299
01:00:31,527 --> 01:00:32,495
What?

1300
01:00:32,528 --> 01:00:33,496
Never mind.

1301
01:00:38,401 --> 01:00:39,802
You know,

1302
01:00:39,836 --> 01:00:40,870
i don't know
why you 2 guys

1303
01:00:40,903 --> 01:00:43,373
even bothered to come up here in the first place.

1304
01:00:43,406 --> 01:00:45,742
2 days,
and neither of you has even had the guts

1305
01:00:45,775 --> 01:00:46,743
to try on a
pair of skis.

1306
01:00:46,776 --> 01:00:47,777
Gin.

1307
01:00:48,344 --> 01:00:50,747
We were thinking of going up tomorrow, freddie.

1308
01:00:50,780 --> 01:00:53,716
Mmm-hmm.
Well, tomorrow's the club ski-jump championship.

1309
01:00:53,750 --> 01:00:56,019
Oh, too bad. Maybe
the day after, then.

1310
01:00:56,886 --> 01:00:58,921
We're going back
the day after.

1311
01:00:58,955 --> 01:01:00,990
Well, as the dodgers
always say,

1312
01:01:01,024 --> 01:01:02,358
"wait till next year."

1313
01:01:03,426 --> 01:01:04,927
Chicken.

1314
01:01:04,961 --> 01:01:06,763
"Sticks and
stones will"--

1315
01:01:06,796 --> 01:01:08,898
you could win tomorrow if you wanted to.

1316
01:01:08,931 --> 01:01:10,700
Of course,
i could.

1317
01:01:10,733 --> 01:01:12,068
I like
winners.

1318
01:01:12,101 --> 01:01:15,538
He's never jumped in
his life. He's afraid to.

1319
01:01:15,571 --> 01:01:16,939
That is true?

1320
01:01:16,973 --> 01:01:18,574
You're afraid?

1321
01:01:18,608 --> 01:01:19,942
Such a waste
of energy.

1322
01:01:20,777 --> 01:01:21,944
[Nita]
you jump for me.

1323
01:01:21,978 --> 01:01:23,579
[Todd]
but--but--but i...

1324
01:01:23,613 --> 01:01:25,948
you win the
championship tomorrow.

1325
01:01:25,982 --> 01:01:29,018
You want me to risk my life for a little gold cup?

1326
01:01:29,052 --> 01:01:31,754
No, todd, you win
more than the gold cup.

1327
01:01:32,055 --> 01:01:35,958
If you win tomorrow,
we play the american game.

1328
01:01:35,992 --> 01:01:37,894
Spin the bottle.

1329
01:01:38,895 --> 01:01:40,363
Well, what
did you expect?

1330
01:01:40,396 --> 01:01:41,798
This is an
american picture.

1331
01:01:41,831 --> 01:01:44,033
All right,
i'll jump.

1332
01:01:44,067 --> 01:01:45,868
Todd!

1333
01:01:45,902 --> 01:01:47,937
That voice sounds
vaguely familiar.

1334
01:01:47,970 --> 01:01:49,605
I hate you.

1335
01:01:54,143 --> 01:01:55,978
I do hope you win.

1336
01:01:58,815 --> 01:02:00,049
Perfect
feminine logic.

1337
01:02:00,083 --> 01:02:03,052
"I hate you. I
do hope you win."

1338
01:02:03,086 --> 01:02:04,420
That's logical.

1339
01:02:05,588 --> 01:02:08,825
We, who are about to watch you die,
salute you.

1340
01:02:12,862 --> 01:02:14,831
Until tomorrow.

1341
01:02:28,111 --> 01:02:29,579
Well, what choice
did i have?

1342
01:02:29,612 --> 01:02:32,615
I don't know.
We could have stayed home and done pushups.

1343
01:02:53,870 --> 01:02:54,904
[Todd]
come on in.

1344
01:03:04,347 --> 01:03:05,548
I got it.

1345
01:03:06,082 --> 01:03:08,518
It's lucky i remembered the morning weather balloon.

1346
01:03:08,551 --> 01:03:09,886
I never knew
helium was so heavy.

1347
01:03:09,919 --> 01:03:11,854
Here, bring
it over here.

1348
01:03:11,888 --> 01:03:13,856
Let's see. I
got everything?

1349
01:03:13,890 --> 01:03:15,124
Mmm-hmm.

1350
01:03:15,158 --> 01:03:17,860
This goes in here.

1351
01:03:19,095 --> 01:03:20,129
Ok?

1352
01:03:20,163 --> 01:03:22,064
Now, let's strap this on with a couple of my belts,

1353
01:03:22,098 --> 01:03:23,332
and we'll be
ready to go.

1354
01:03:23,366 --> 01:03:24,967
Do you think
it'll work?

1355
01:03:25,001 --> 01:03:25,902
Why not? It
works in movies.

1767
01:28:01,909 --> 01:28:03,344
Nora, you
idiot.

1768
01:28:03,378 --> 01:28:06,114
Oh, uh, uh,
can you take it, old man?

1769
01:28:06,147 --> 01:28:07,882
Hurry up and tell me before i flip out!

1770
01:28:07,915 --> 01:28:09,183
Where is she?

1771
01:28:09,217 --> 01:28:10,351
Let's have
a talk.

1772
01:28:10,385 --> 01:28:12,320
Excuse me for
a second, honey.

1773
01:28:12,353 --> 01:28:13,888
Just for
a second.

1774
01:28:13,921 --> 01:28:15,356
Come on.

1775
01:28:17,358 --> 01:28:19,160
You still haven't
told me a thing.

1776
01:28:19,193 --> 01:28:20,728
Why are we
stopping here?

1777
01:28:21,829 --> 01:28:23,665
Do these
look familiar?

1778
01:28:24,432 --> 01:28:25,366
Nora!

1779
01:28:26,601 --> 01:28:28,202
They're nora's.
Where?

1780
01:28:28,569 --> 01:28:30,038
Out there
somewhere.

1781
01:28:30,071 --> 01:28:31,973
You see,
when she heard you were coming,

1782
01:28:32,006 --> 01:28:34,208
she started swimming in that direction.

1783
01:28:34,242 --> 01:28:35,977
Right now,
i'd say she was somewhere

1784
01:28:36,010 --> 01:28:37,645
between here
and japan.

1785
01:28:37,679 --> 01:28:39,580
That's about as
close as i can get.

1786
01:28:39,614 --> 01:28:41,349
Oh, no. Nora!

1787
01:28:42,417 --> 01:28:44,185
Nora! I'm
coming, darling!

1788
01:28:45,753 --> 01:28:47,355
Nora!

1789
01:28:47,388 --> 01:28:49,724
Remember, float on
your back, darling,

1790
01:28:49,757 --> 01:28:51,492
if you get tired.

1791
01:28:51,526 --> 01:28:54,395
If you hurry,
you might catch her somewhere near guam.

1792
01:28:54,429 --> 01:28:57,031
Nora, i'm coming, darling!

1793
01:28:57,565 --> 01:28:59,434
Pretty mean
thing to do, huh?

1794
01:28:59,467 --> 01:29:02,770
Well, don't worry.
We'll tell him the truth tomorrow...

1795
01:29:03,471 --> 01:29:05,606
if he comes back.

1796
01:29:05,640 --> 01:29:07,408
Dear doctor lansdorf,

1797
01:29:07,442 --> 01:29:10,611
i--i really feel that
i am getting better.

1798
01:29:11,779 --> 01:29:16,384
Except, doctor,
there are some very strange things happening

1799
01:29:16,417 --> 01:29:18,019
like all of a
sudden, the--

1800
01:29:18,052 --> 01:29:20,254
the skis have
gotten much fatter.

1801
01:29:20,288 --> 01:29:22,457
<i>The d.j.'s are saying that</i>
<i>the snow reports are good</i>

1802
01:29:22,490 --> 01:29:25,393

1803
