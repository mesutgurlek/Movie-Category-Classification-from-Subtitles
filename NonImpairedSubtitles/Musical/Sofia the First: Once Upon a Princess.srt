1
00:00:08,388 --> 00:00:09,389
Oh.

2
00:00:10,891 --> 00:00:12,734
Once upon a time...

3
00:00:12,793 --> 00:00:15,330
- Oh, I want to tell it!
- Me, too!

4
00:00:15,395 --> 00:00:17,500
Okay. We'll all tell it.

5
00:00:17,564 --> 00:00:19,441
- Wonderful!
- Mmm-hmm.

6
00:00:19,499 --> 00:00:21,001
You start.

7
00:00:25,072 --> 00:00:29,282
Once upon a time,
in the magical kingdom of Enchancia,

8
00:00:29,343 --> 00:00:32,847
there lived a young girl named Sofia.

9
00:00:32,913 --> 00:00:35,120
Sofia led a simple life,

10
00:00:35,182 --> 00:00:38,857
working at the village shoe shop
with her mother, Miranda.

11
00:00:38,985 --> 00:00:43,593
One fateful day, they were
summoned by King Roland II,

12
00:00:43,657 --> 00:00:46,536
who needed a new pair
of royal slippers.

13
00:00:46,593 --> 00:00:48,266
Oh, I hope they're blue!

14
00:00:48,328 --> 00:00:49,398
No, red!

15
00:00:49,463 --> 00:00:50,771
We'll see.

16
00:00:50,831 --> 00:00:53,505
Sofia and her mother
arrived at the castle.

17
00:00:53,567 --> 00:00:56,480
Sofia was very excited to meet the King.

18
00:00:56,536 --> 00:00:59,483
Miranda placed
a slipper on the King's foot.

19
00:00:59,606 --> 00:01:03,076
It was a perfect fit. And so were they!

20
00:01:03,243 --> 00:01:06,247
King Roland and Miranda
were soon married.

21
00:01:06,446 --> 00:01:09,188
And what seemed like
a storybook ending...

22
00:01:09,316 --> 00:01:13,196
...was really a storybook beginning.

23
00:01:13,353 --> 00:01:16,664
Sofia! It's time to go! Come on, honey.

24
00:01:16,723 --> 00:01:18,066
The coach is waiting.

25
00:01:18,125 --> 00:01:19,433
Coming!

26
00:01:24,731 --> 00:01:27,735
- Good luck, Sofia!
- Don't forget about us!

27
00:01:27,801 --> 00:01:29,974
Bye, Jade! Bye, Ruby!

28
00:01:30,036 --> 00:01:31,879
Bye, Sofia!

29
00:01:33,240 --> 00:01:34,844
Bye!

30
00:01:53,560 --> 00:01:57,269
Mom! We're almost there!
I wonder what our room will look like.

31
00:01:57,330 --> 00:02:02,177
Sofia, now that we're living in the castle,
you're going to have your own bedroom.

32
00:02:02,302 --> 00:02:03,474
Yes!

33
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:20,000

Uh-oh.

36
00:02:47,113 --> 00:02:50,094
Looks like someone's not going to be
the fairest in the land anymore.

37
00:02:50,150 --> 00:02:55,600
Amber, James, I trust you'll do your best
to make your new sister feel welcome.

38
00:02:55,655 --> 00:02:56,690
Of course, Father.

39
00:02:56,756 --> 00:02:59,134
Your Majesty.

40
00:02:59,192 --> 00:03:01,103
King Roland II.

41
00:03:01,161 --> 00:03:02,663
Queen Miranda.

42
00:03:06,700 --> 00:03:08,941
- Hey there!
- Good morrow, Sofia.

43
00:03:09,002 --> 00:03:11,039
Great morrow, Prince James!

44
00:03:11,104 --> 00:03:14,517
Princess Amber,
I'm so excited we're sisters!

45
00:03:14,574 --> 00:03:15,712
Stepsisters.

46
00:03:15,775 --> 00:03:17,220
Amber, James,

47
00:03:17,277 --> 00:03:21,089
I know there aren't many fairy tales
about kind and loving stepmothers.

48
00:03:21,147 --> 00:03:23,149
But I hope to change that.

49
00:03:23,216 --> 00:03:25,890
These are for you. I sewed them myself.

50
00:03:26,586 --> 00:03:27,929
It's our family crest.

51
00:03:27,988 --> 00:03:29,399
That's right, James.

52
00:03:29,456 --> 00:03:32,300
Because that is what
all this is really about,

53
00:03:32,359 --> 00:03:34,236
becoming a new family.

54
00:03:34,294 --> 00:03:36,900
Sofia, welcome to the family.

55
00:03:37,264 --> 00:03:41,041
All hail Queen Miranda
and Princess Sofia!

56
00:03:43,503 --> 00:03:46,143
Grow ye, flora!

57
00:03:52,012 --> 00:03:55,050
Cedric. I said flowers, not showers.

58
00:03:55,415 --> 00:03:59,158
Oh. Excuse me, Your Highness.
I'm still breaking in my new wand.

59
00:03:59,252 --> 00:04:01,698
That's Cedric, our royal sorcerer.

60
00:04:01,755 --> 00:04:04,429
He comes from along line
of royal sorcerers.

61
00:04:04,491 --> 00:04:06,129
So, we're stuck with him.

62
00:04:06,192 --> 00:04:07,193
Mmm. Ooh!

63
00:04:10,030 --> 00:04:11,976
-- Ooh.

64
00:04:12,032 --> 00:04:13,705
Rose petals.

65
00:04:17,837 --> 00:04:19,316
Should I wave?

66
00:04:19,372 --> 00:04:21,648
Yes. You should wave.

67
00:04:21,708 --> 00:04:25,622
Right. Hi! Hello!

68
00:04:35,455 --> 00:04:38,026
We don't have to curtsey
unless they're royalty.

69
00:04:38,091 --> 00:04:41,334
I think it's going to take me a while
to get the hang of things around here.

70
00:04:41,394 --> 00:04:43,704
Just follow my lead and you'll be okay.

71
00:04:43,763 --> 00:04:44,935
Great.

72
00:04:44,998 --> 00:04:47,501
That means I lead. You follow.

73
00:04:47,567 --> 00:04:50,047
Oh. Okay. Following.

74
00:04:52,906 --> 00:04:56,752
Oh, be careful, mate.
That's the new princess' throne.

75
00:05:03,550 --> 00:05:06,258
Child! Watch where you're dawdling.

76
00:05:06,319 --> 00:05:08,731
Mr. Ceedric!

77
00:05:08,788 --> 00:05:10,062
It's Cedric.

78
00:05:10,123 --> 00:05:12,535
It's so great to meet a real live sorcerer.

79
00:05:12,592 --> 00:05:14,868
That flower trick was amazing.

80
00:05:14,928 --> 00:05:18,375
If by amazing, you mean
a complete waste of my talents,

81
00:05:18,431 --> 00:05:19,535
then, yes, thank you.

82
00:05:19,599 --> 00:05:22,375
I should be out slaying dragons,
battling ogres.

83
00:05:22,469 --> 00:05:23,812
But, no!

84
00:05:23,870 --> 00:05:27,875
King Roland has me doing parlor tricks
when I should be...

85
00:05:29,376 --> 00:05:31,253
- Mr. Ceedric?

86
00:05:31,311 --> 00:05:33,518
I am Baileywick. The castle steward.

87
00:05:33,580 --> 00:05:35,491
It is my responsibility to make sure

88
00:05:35,548 --> 00:05:37,994
everything in the castle
is where it should be,

89
00:05:38,051 --> 00:05:39,189
when it should be,

90
00:05:39,252 --> 00:05:42,461
and you, my dear, should be
in the banquet hall, 30 seconds ago.

91
00:05:42,522 --> 00:05:44,661
- Oh, right.
- Off you go.

92
00:05:44,724 --> 00:05:46,169
Going.

93
00:05:50,263 --> 00:05:51,571
Hmm.

94
00:05:52,766 --> 00:05:53,836
Mmm.

95
00:05:53,900 --> 00:05:55,743
- Sofia.

96
00:05:56,169 --> 00:05:58,206
Yes, Your Majesty?

97
00:05:58,271 --> 00:06:01,343
Call me Roland.
Or, "You with the crown."

98
00:06:01,408 --> 00:06:02,944
Or Dad.

99
00:06:03,009 --> 00:06:05,455
It's a tradition to provide
an official welcome

100
00:06:05,512 --> 00:06:07,549
to every new member
of the royal family.

101
00:06:07,614 --> 00:06:09,890
For your mother, it was the wedding.

102
00:06:09,949 --> 00:06:14,091
But for you, we will be throwing
a royal ball in your honor at week's end.

103
00:06:14,220 --> 00:06:16,427
- Brilliant!
- James, manners.

104
00:06:16,556 --> 00:06:17,626
Sorry.

105
00:06:17,691 --> 00:06:19,728
A ball? Just for me?

106
00:06:19,793 --> 00:06:21,773
Father, why didn't I get a ball?

107
00:06:21,828 --> 00:06:24,707
You did, Amber.
When you and your brother were born.

108
00:06:24,764 --> 00:06:26,107
You don't remember?

109
00:06:26,166 --> 00:06:29,170
Sofia, it will be your royal debut.

110
00:06:29,235 --> 00:06:31,078
And you and I
shall dance the first waltz.

111
00:06:31,137 --> 00:06:33,743
Oh, Rollie. You're so sweet.

112
00:06:33,807 --> 00:06:35,184
I have to dance?

113
00:06:35,241 --> 00:06:38,745
Why, what better way to let everyone
in the tri-kingdom area know

114
00:06:38,812 --> 00:06:41,190
that Princess Sofia has arrived!

115
00:06:48,988 --> 00:06:50,695
This is my room?

116
00:06:50,757 --> 00:06:53,897
No, sweetie. This is your room.

117
00:07:02,736 --> 00:07:04,909
It's so huge.

118
00:07:04,971 --> 00:07:07,508
Looks like the standard princess suite
to me.

119
00:07:07,574 --> 00:07:09,315
You've got your canopy bed,

120
00:07:09,375 --> 00:07:13,323
window seat, playing area,
reading nook.

121
00:07:13,413 --> 00:07:17,919
And in here, you'll find all your gowns
and royal accessories.

122
00:07:18,551 --> 00:07:19,586
Wow.

123
00:07:19,652 --> 00:07:22,223
Now, if you need anything at all,
any time of day,

124
00:07:22,288 --> 00:07:24,393
all you have to do is ring this bell.

125
00:07:26,593 --> 00:07:28,163
Yes, mum. You rang?

126
00:07:28,228 --> 00:07:29,434
Do you need anything?

127
00:07:29,496 --> 00:07:30,941
I don't know. Do I?

128
00:07:30,997 --> 00:07:35,002
Well, when you know what you need,
you know what to do.

129
00:07:36,870 --> 00:07:39,009
Good evening, Princess Sofia.

130
00:07:40,440 --> 00:07:41,646
'Night.

131
00:07:53,987 --> 00:07:56,558
<i>Everything seems crazy big</i>

132
00:07:56,623 --> 00:07:59,604
<i>And I'm feeling unsteady</i>

133
00:07:59,659 --> 00:08:02,401
<i>Mom says I'll be just fine</i>

134
00:08:02,462 --> 00:08:05,102
<i>But I don't think I'm ready</i>

135
00:08:05,165 --> 00:08:08,146
<i>New school, new friends, new family</i>

136
00:08:08,201 --> 00:08:11,512
<i>And a ball
where they want me to dance</i>

137
00:08:11,571 --> 00:08:15,678
<i>I'm just a little girl
from a small, small town</i>

138
00:08:15,809 --> 00:08:21,191
<i>In this world I don't stand a chance</i>

139
00:08:22,315 --> 00:08:26,821
<i>I'm not ready to be a princess</i>

140
00:08:26,886 --> 00:08:29,423
<i>I don't have what it takes</i>

141
00:08:29,489 --> 00:08:32,868
<i>I'm too short for gowns
I look bad in crowns</i>

142
00:08:32,926 --> 00:08:35,668
<i>And I'm gonna make
a bajillion mistakes</i>

143
00:08:35,728 --> 00:08:38,607
<i>I'm too average to be a princess</i>

144
00:08:38,665 --> 00:08:41,305
<i>I respectfully refuse</i>

145
00:08:41,601 --> 00:08:44,548
<i>I don't know the rules
I don't want the jewels</i>

146
00:08:44,604 --> 00:08:47,983
<i>And these feet were made
for comfortable shoes</i>

147
00:08:49,542 --> 00:08:54,616
<i>Shelves bursting with trinkets
that I'm afraid to touch</i>

148
00:08:54,814 --> 00:09:00,958
<i>Fancy toys and ginormous pillows
It's all much too much</i>

149
00:09:01,020 --> 00:09:03,296
<i>Too much</i>

150
00:09:03,423 --> 00:09:07,200
<i>I'm not ready to be a princess</i>

151
00:09:07,260 --> 00:09:10,139
<i>One look and that seems clear</i>

152
00:09:10,196 --> 00:09:13,040
<i>Cancel my debut
Keep your royal crew</i>

153
00:09:13,099 --> 00:09:15,511
<i>And if I ever find Mom's room</i>

154
00:09:15,568 --> 00:09:17,605
<i>I'm outta here</i>

155
00:09:19,172 --> 00:09:24,622
<i>Sofia, not a noble name</i>

156
00:09:25,011 --> 00:09:31,656
<i>Sofia, even my wave is lame</i>

157
00:09:31,718 --> 00:09:35,495
<i>I'm not ready</i>

158
00:09:35,555 --> 00:09:42,268
<i>To be a princess</i>

159
00:09:43,563 --> 00:09:45,133
Sofia?

160
00:09:45,198 --> 00:09:46,643
Oh, Mom!

161
00:09:50,270 --> 00:09:51,943
What's the matter, sweetheart?

162
00:09:52,005 --> 00:09:53,643
I don't want a royal ball.

163
00:09:53,706 --> 00:09:57,119
Oh, Sofia. I've never known you
to turn down a party,

164
00:09:57,176 --> 00:09:58,917
especially one thrown just for you.

165
00:09:58,978 --> 00:10:02,084
But I don't know anything
about being a princess.

166
00:10:02,448 --> 00:10:04,359
And I don't know how to dance.

167
00:10:04,417 --> 00:10:07,523
I'm going to trip
and everyone's going to laugh at me.

168
00:10:07,587 --> 00:10:09,032
You'll do fine.

169
00:10:09,088 --> 00:10:11,568
And besides,
no one ever laughs at a princess.

170
00:10:11,624 --> 00:10:13,194
Says who?

171
00:10:13,259 --> 00:10:15,000
Come here, Sofia.

172
00:10:15,061 --> 00:10:16,540
Just try the best you can.

173
00:10:16,596 --> 00:10:20,442
And if it's not good enough for all those
stuffy dukes and duchesses,

174
00:10:20,500 --> 00:10:22,673
then that's their problem. Mmm-hmm?

175
00:10:22,869 --> 00:10:24,974
Sofia, I have something for you.

176
00:10:25,038 --> 00:10:27,177
Consider it a welcome gift.

177
00:10:32,078 --> 00:10:34,080
It's beautiful.

178
00:10:34,147 --> 00:10:38,618
It's a very special amulet,
so you must promise to never take it off.

179
00:10:41,387 --> 00:10:43,264
That way you'll never lose it.

180
00:10:44,223 --> 00:10:45,702
I promise.

181
00:10:47,660 --> 00:10:49,537
Now, you best run off to bed.

182
00:10:49,595 --> 00:10:51,370
You have princess school
in the morning.

183
00:10:51,431 --> 00:10:53,069
- Princess school?
- Royal Prep.

184
00:10:53,132 --> 00:10:55,703
Where all the princes and princesses
from every kingdom

185
00:10:55,768 --> 00:10:57,611
go to learn our royal ways,

186
00:10:57,670 --> 00:11:01,345
including everything you'd need
to know for the royal ball,

187
00:11:01,407 --> 00:11:03,751
which I'm very much looking forward to.

188
00:11:03,943 --> 00:11:06,014
Me, too. Thank you.

189
00:11:06,579 --> 00:11:07,819
Good night, Sofia.

190
00:11:07,880 --> 00:11:09,188
'Night.

191
00:11:09,415 --> 00:11:12,396
Everything's going to be just fine.

192
00:11:19,659 --> 00:11:20,660
-- Ooh.

193
00:11:20,760 --> 00:11:22,068
Sorry, Mr. Ceedric.

194
00:11:22,128 --> 00:11:26,235
Cedric. Why can't you... Your amulet.

195
00:11:26,299 --> 00:11:29,303
Isn't it lovely? The King gave it to me.

196
00:11:29,369 --> 00:11:30,905
Well, good night!

197
00:11:33,573 --> 00:11:36,986
She has the Amulet of Avalor!

198
00:11:37,043 --> 00:11:40,115
But not for long.

199
00:11:43,750 --> 00:11:45,320
Oh, how could I have missed it?

200
00:11:45,385 --> 00:11:46,955
After all these years,

201
00:11:47,020 --> 00:11:51,469
I can't believe the Amulet of Avalor
was right under my nose.

202
00:11:52,158 --> 00:11:57,039
Yes. Now, all I have to do
is pry it from the princess

203
00:11:57,130 --> 00:12:01,704
and I'll finally have the power
to take over the kingdom!

204
00:12:13,880 --> 00:12:16,121
Maybe I am ready to be a princess.

205
00:12:30,000 --> 00:12:40,000

00:13:19,712 --> 00:13:21,350
What is going on in here?

207
00:13:21,414 --> 00:13:23,257
This is a castle, not a farm.

208
00:13:23,316 --> 00:13:25,523
Out! Out, out! Shoo! Shoo! Shoo!

209
00:13:25,651 --> 00:13:28,825
-- Out! Out, out! Go on!

210
00:13:29,589 --> 00:13:33,298
Breakfast will be ready in five minutes.
And then it's off to school.

211
00:13:35,761 --> 00:13:37,365
Whoa! Steady now.

212
00:13:37,430 --> 00:13:38,841
-- Wow.

213
00:13:41,200 --> 00:13:42,440
Hey, Sofia.

214
00:13:42,502 --> 00:13:44,539
Hi! Wait for me.

215
00:13:47,840 --> 00:13:49,513
Why do the horses have...

216
00:13:51,777 --> 00:13:52,812
Whoo-hoo!

217
00:13:52,879 --> 00:13:53,949
Yeah!

218
00:14:01,954 --> 00:14:03,661
Amazing.

219
00:14:24,010 --> 00:14:26,047
Princess Sofia.

220
00:14:26,112 --> 00:14:27,318
Up here, dear.

221
00:14:27,380 --> 00:14:30,759
Welcome to
the Royal Preparatory Academy.

222
00:14:30,816 --> 00:14:34,059
I'm Flora.
And this is Fauna and this is...

223
00:14:34,120 --> 00:14:36,464
Merryweather.
We' re the head mistresses

224
00:14:36,522 --> 00:14:37,694
...of Royal Prep.

225
00:14:37,757 --> 00:14:39,498
We're so excited you're here.

226
00:14:39,592 --> 00:14:43,768
We're always looking
for a few good princesses.

227
00:14:43,996 --> 00:14:47,273
That's great because I need to learn
to act like one by Friday.

228
00:14:47,333 --> 00:14:49,006
- Oh! Oh my!

229
00:14:52,171 --> 00:14:55,516
I'm afraid it will take a little longer
than a few days

230
00:14:55,575 --> 00:14:57,646
to learn how to be a princess.

231
00:14:57,710 --> 00:14:59,383
You see...

232
00:14:59,445 --> 00:15:03,757
<i>When someone new enrolls here
at good ol' Royal Prep</i>

233
00:15:03,816 --> 00:15:05,853
<i>They're at that great beginning</i>

234
00:15:05,918 --> 00:15:08,489
<i>They're taking that first step</i>

235
00:15:08,955 --> 00:15:13,904
<i>Your lessons will commence here
once you pass through this door</i>

236
00:15:14,026 --> 00:15:15,664
<i>So why not come and join us</i>

237
00:15:15,761 --> 00:15:17,798
<i>And see what lies in store?</i>

238
00:15:17,863 --> 00:15:19,240
<i>You'll learn the art of manners</i>

239
00:15:19,332 --> 00:15:21,505
<i>- Of royal protocol
- That's right</i>

240
00:15:21,567 --> 00:15:24,776
<i>And when to bow and curtsey
for functions big and small</i>

241
00:15:24,837 --> 00:15:26,874
<i>You'll read books of fact and fiction</i>

242
00:15:26,939 --> 00:15:28,680
<i>Of poetry and prose</i>

243
00:15:28,741 --> 00:15:32,052
<i>You'll learn to give a royal speech
while perfectly composed</i>

244
00:15:32,111 --> 00:15:35,615
<i>At Royal Prep, step-by-step
You'll gain wisdom and pep</i>

245
00:15:35,681 --> 00:15:39,151
<i>So heed the call
Come be all you can be</i>

246
00:15:39,218 --> 00:15:43,030
<i>- Every task, every test
- Just give it your best</i>

247
00:15:43,089 --> 00:15:46,593
<i>- And we'll do the rest

248
00:15:46,659 --> 00:15:50,106

249
00:15:50,162 --> 00:15:54,042
<i>"Rule over others as you'd have them
rule over you"</i>

250
00:15:54,133 --> 00:15:58,377
<i>You're taking your first step
at Royal Prep</i>

251
00:16:01,107 --> 00:16:05,078
<i>We'll explore enchanted objects
Each creature, every charm</i>

252
00:16:05,144 --> 00:16:08,489
<i>So spells of evil magic
will never do you harm</i>

253
00:16:08,614 --> 00:16:12,084
<i>In arts and crafts, you'll draw and paint
Or maybe work with wood</i>

254
00:16:12,218 --> 00:16:15,893
<i>You'll learn to fence as well as dance
For footwork both are good</i>

255
00:16:15,955 --> 00:16:18,993
<i>At Royal Prep, step-by-step

261
00:16:37,910 --> 00:16:41,483

262
00:16:41,547 --> 00:16:45,222

264
00:16:51,257 --> 00:16:57,503
<i>At Royal Prep</i>

265
00:17:05,938 --> 00:17:08,145
Time for your first class, dear.

266
00:17:08,207 --> 00:17:09,618
Good luck.

267
00:17:11,544 --> 00:17:14,024
Class, we have a new student.

268
00:17:14,080 --> 00:17:15,821
How should we greet her?

269
00:17:16,615 --> 00:17:18,492
- Good morning.
- Good morning.

270
00:17:18,551 --> 00:17:20,155
- Good morning.
- Good morning.

271
00:17:20,920 --> 00:17:23,161
- Good morning. Ooh!
- Oh, dear.

272
00:17:26,726 --> 00:17:28,797
- Let me help you with that.
- Here's your book.

273
00:17:35,668 --> 00:17:38,478
And then she dropped her forks
all over the floor.

274
00:17:38,537 --> 00:17:41,381
Hi! I'm Sofia. Amber's sister.

275
00:17:41,440 --> 00:17:42,646
Stepsister.

276
00:17:43,242 --> 00:17:45,085
- Wow. Nice amulet.
- Thank you.

277
00:17:45,144 --> 00:17:47,522
- Are you going to wear it to your ball?
- We're all going.

278
00:17:47,580 --> 00:17:48,854
We can't wait.

279
00:17:52,718 --> 00:17:54,129
- Whoo!
- Oh!

280
00:17:55,921 --> 00:17:57,594
Hey, Amber. What's going on?

281
00:17:57,656 --> 00:18:00,899
I think it's time Sofia took a ride
on the magic swing.

282
00:18:03,396 --> 00:18:04,739
I don't know, Amber.

283
00:18:04,797 --> 00:18:06,299
Father asked us
to make her feel welcome.

284
00:18:06,365 --> 00:18:08,868
Isn't that how you welcome
all the new students?

285
00:18:09,335 --> 00:18:12,475
Well, all right.

286
00:18:13,906 --> 00:18:15,146
Hey, Sofia.

287
00:18:15,207 --> 00:18:17,244
Oh, hi, James. What's going on?

288
00:18:17,309 --> 00:18:19,084
Have you tried
the enchanted swing set?

289
00:18:19,145 --> 00:18:21,125
You don't have to kick. It swings itself.

290
00:18:21,180 --> 00:18:22,853
Go on. Try it.

291
00:18:24,417 --> 00:18:27,660
Swings itself.
Never heard of that before.

292
00:18:29,822 --> 00:18:30,926
Hmm.

293
00:18:41,834 --> 00:18:42,835
Oh.

294
00:18:43,436 --> 00:18:44,437
Uh...

295
00:18:44,537 --> 00:18:45,743
Oh, no.

296
00:18:46,372 --> 00:18:47,715
Here we go.

297
00:18:48,941 --> 00:18:50,113
Whoa.

298
00:18:50,676 --> 00:18:51,814
Whoa!

299
00:18:52,611 --> 00:18:53,817
Whoa!

300
00:18:59,819 --> 00:19:02,129
Good one, James. You got me.

301
00:19:02,188 --> 00:19:03,189
Oh.

302
00:19:03,255 --> 00:19:05,531
Don't worry.
The first day is always the hardest.

303
00:19:05,591 --> 00:19:07,127
He played the same prank on me.

304
00:19:07,193 --> 00:19:10,333
I better go dry off before the next class.

305
00:19:10,729 --> 00:19:12,470
Sofia, wait!

306
00:19:12,765 --> 00:19:14,836
I thought you said she was your sister.

307
00:19:14,900 --> 00:19:16,470
She is.

308
00:19:26,045 --> 00:19:27,456
What's that sound?

309
00:19:43,863 --> 00:19:46,309
Oh, look. A baby bird.

310
00:19:51,670 --> 00:19:53,411
It's all right. I can help.

311
00:19:57,443 --> 00:19:59,047
There you go.

312
00:19:59,111 --> 00:20:00,613
Just the two of you.

313
00:20:01,981 --> 00:20:03,790
The way it should be.

314
00:20:05,651 --> 00:20:06,652
Huh?

315
00:20:12,825 --> 00:20:15,237
I guess I gotta go back.

316
00:20:16,161 --> 00:20:17,663
Bye.

317
00:20:17,897 --> 00:20:19,205
Thank you!

318
00:20:20,699 --> 00:20:22,042
Thank you.

319
00:20:22,134 --> 00:20:23,204
Huh?

320
00:20:39,818 --> 00:20:43,288
We shouldn't have played that prank.
Sofia, wait!

321
00:20:49,728 --> 00:20:50,968
Princess Sofia!

322
00:20:51,030 --> 00:20:54,409
Oh, how was your first day of school,
my dear?

323
00:20:54,466 --> 00:20:56,241
Tougher than I thought it would be.

324
00:20:56,302 --> 00:20:58,680
Oh, poor thing.

325
00:20:59,204 --> 00:21:04,654
Well, then, how would you like
a private tour of my lair?

326
00:21:04,944 --> 00:21:06,787
I... I mean, workshop.

327
00:21:06,845 --> 00:21:11,487
You know, not even the King himself
has seen it.

328
00:21:11,550 --> 00:21:12,551
Hmm?

329
00:21:14,453 --> 00:21:16,694
Just up the stairs. Come along.

330
00:21:29,435 --> 00:21:34,316
And this, my dear,
is where the magic happens.

331
00:21:39,078 --> 00:21:41,752
Oh, that's just Wormwood, my raven.

332
00:21:41,814 --> 00:21:44,795
Now, you stop it, Wormie!
You're scaring the princess.

333
00:21:45,217 --> 00:21:49,359
Now, I make all the royal potions
right here.

334
00:21:49,455 --> 00:21:52,561
Wow! This is really neat, Mr. Ceedric.

335
00:21:53,025 --> 00:21:55,767
Hey, that looks just like my amulet.

336
00:21:55,861 --> 00:22:00,367
Well, I'll be a dragon's uncle,
you're right.

337
00:22:00,432 --> 00:22:02,912
Oh, but if you had the Amulet of Avalor,

338
00:22:02,968 --> 00:22:06,347
you'd know,
for it contains powerful magic.

339
00:22:06,405 --> 00:22:09,352
With each deed performed,
for better or worse,

340
00:22:09,441 --> 00:22:12,888
a power is granted, a blessing or curse.

341
00:22:13,112 --> 00:22:15,023
- Really?
- Well, yeah, you know,

342
00:22:15,080 --> 00:22:16,525
if it's the real amulet.

343
00:22:16,582 --> 00:22:20,530
But only a certified sorcerer,
such as myself, could tell for sure.

344
00:22:20,586 --> 00:22:24,625
If you like, I can take a quick look at it.

345
00:22:24,690 --> 00:22:25,794
I don't know.

346
00:22:25,858 --> 00:22:29,203
Oh, I'll give it right back. I promise.

347
00:22:29,294 --> 00:22:31,399
But I promised never to take it off.

348
00:22:31,463 --> 00:22:35,878
And my mother says, "A broken promise
can never be glued back together."

349
00:22:36,168 --> 00:22:39,047
How irritatingly charming.

350
00:22:39,104 --> 00:22:42,017
Oh, well, look at the time.
Hope you enjoyed the tour.

351
00:22:42,074 --> 00:22:45,214
I know how hard it can be
adjusting to royal life.

352
00:22:45,277 --> 00:22:50,192
So, if you ever need any help,
my door is always open.

353
00:22:50,683 --> 00:22:53,926
Ooh! I'll get that amulet.

354
00:23:08,500 --> 00:23:10,138
Well, should we wake her up?

355
00:23:10,202 --> 00:23:13,843
Are you kidding? The girl screamed
like a banshee yesterday.

356
00:23:13,906 --> 00:23:15,180
And I got sensitive ears.

357
00:23:16,475 --> 00:23:18,751
- I'm not going to scream.
- That's a relief.

358
00:23:20,079 --> 00:23:22,252
- You can hear us?
- You can talk?

359
00:23:22,715 --> 00:23:24,786
"Can he stop talking?"
is a better question.

360
00:23:24,917 --> 00:23:26,954
Hey!
So, what are we dealing with here?

361
00:23:27,019 --> 00:23:29,932
Some kind of a magic spell
or something?

362
00:23:30,255 --> 00:23:31,290
Hmm.

363
00:23:31,356 --> 00:23:35,202
"With each deed performed,
for better or worse,

364
00:23:35,260 --> 00:23:38,901
"a power is granted,
a blessing or curse."

365
00:23:39,164 --> 00:23:41,735
I helped a baby bird yesterday

366
00:23:41,800 --> 00:23:45,441
and I think the amulet gave
me the power to talk to animals!

367
00:23:45,637 --> 00:23:47,241
Oh.

368
00:23:47,306 --> 00:23:50,617
That is great, kid,
'cause there's a few things that

369
00:23:50,676 --> 00:23:52,917
I've been meaning to talk
to you princesses about.

370
00:23:52,978 --> 00:23:55,857
Clover, not now.
She needs to get dressed for school.

371
00:23:55,914 --> 00:23:58,258
It's okay, Clover. Tell me.

372
00:23:58,317 --> 00:24:00,923
Whoa, whoa, whoa. You ever heard of
personal space, momma? Put me down.

373
00:24:00,986 --> 00:24:04,433
Oh, sorry. You're just so cute
and cuddly I couldn't help it.

374
00:24:04,490 --> 00:24:06,993
- Yeah, well, please, help it.

375
00:24:07,059 --> 00:24:09,869
Okay. Now, why do you think
us woodland creatures

376
00:24:09,928 --> 00:24:13,273
have been helping you princesses
for all these years?

377
00:24:13,332 --> 00:24:14,470
I don't know.

378
00:24:14,767 --> 00:24:15,802
Tell me.

379
00:24:15,868 --> 00:24:17,779
'Cause we gotta eat.

380
00:24:18,036 --> 00:24:19,379
And you got the food.

381
00:24:20,105 --> 00:24:23,609
<i>We've helped princesses
for many eons</i>

382
00:24:23,675 --> 00:24:27,452
<i>But you treat us all like furry peons</i>

383
00:24:27,513 --> 00:24:31,359
<i>We make your bed
Clean up your messes</i>

384
00:24:31,416 --> 00:24:35,455
<i>Wake you up
And put on all your dresses</i>

385
00:24:35,554 --> 00:24:39,730
<i>And what's our reward?
What thanks do we get?</i>

386
00:24:40,225 --> 00:24:47,006
<i>Not a crumb, not a morsel
No brie, no baguette</i>

387
00:24:47,833 --> 00:24:52,509
<i>Did you really think
after all these years</i>

388
00:24:52,571 --> 00:24:57,611
<i>When we did your chores
we were volunteers?</i>

389
00:24:57,676 --> 00:25:02,250
<i>A little bit of food is all that we seek</i>

390
00:25:02,314 --> 00:25:04,157
<i>A little bit to eat</i>

391
00:25:04,216 --> 00:25:06,856
<i>- Fill our tummy
Wet our beak</i>

392
00:25:06,919 --> 00:25:09,160
<i>A little bit to munch</i>

393
00:25:09,221 --> 00:25:10,859
<i>- Like breakfast
- Dinner</i>

394
00:25:10,923 --> 00:25:11,924
<i>Lunch</i>

395
00:25:11,990 --> 00:25:15,904
<i>A nut, a seed, a bean
or just some rice</i>

396
00:25:15,961 --> 00:25:19,932
<i>'Cause a little bit of food
would sure be nice</i>

397
00:25:20,799 --> 00:25:25,077
<i>It really isn't much
Not too much for us to ask</i>

398
00:25:25,137 --> 00:25:29,608
<i>After helping you daily
with each little task</i>

399
00:25:29,708 --> 00:25:34,020
<i>Just a bite or two
Such a modest fee</i>

400
00:25:34,079 --> 00:25:39,995
<i>Even little songbirds
Shouldn't sing for free</i>

401
00:25:41,553 --> 00:25:43,089
Well, if food is what you want...

402
00:25:43,155 --> 00:25:44,463
<i>Just a little bit</i>

403
00:25:44,523 --> 00:25:47,970
...- you've come to the right castle.
- Follow me.

404
00:25:48,660 --> 00:25:53,006
<i>A little bit to munch
And there's nothing quite like brunch</i>

405
00:25:53,065 --> 00:25:57,309
<i>So, deliver just a sliver or a slice</i>

406
00:25:57,536 --> 00:26:02,349
<i>Of whatever tasty treat
all the royal people eat</i>

407
00:26:02,407 --> 00:26:06,913
<i>We'd be glad to make some room
for a lentil or legume</i>

408
00:26:06,979 --> 00:26:11,189
<i>If you want some first-class service
there 's a price</i>

409
00:26:11,283 --> 00:26:15,891
<i>And a little bit of food</i>

410
00:26:16,021 --> 00:26:17,364
<i>Would sure be nice</i>

411
00:26:17,422 --> 00:26:20,232
<i>- Oh, a little bit of food
A little bit of food</i>

412
00:26:20,292 --> 00:26:23,466
<i>- Just a little bit of food
Just a little bit of food</i>

413
00:26:27,366 --> 00:26:28,640
Nice.

414
00:26:32,738 --> 00:26:34,445
Time for school.

415
00:26:34,640 --> 00:26:35,675
Mmm-hmm.

416
00:26:35,908 --> 00:26:38,479
Don't worry about the other kids, Sofia.

417
00:26:38,543 --> 00:26:40,750
You gotta keep your eye on the ball.

418
00:26:40,812 --> 00:26:43,224
And I'm talking about
your royal ball, honey.

419
00:26:43,282 --> 00:26:44,659
You're right, Clover.

420
00:26:44,716 --> 00:26:47,993
I'm going to learn
how to be the best princess ever.

421
00:26:48,053 --> 00:26:49,327
That'll show 'em.

422
00:26:49,388 --> 00:26:51,732
Yo! You go, princess.

423
00:27:00,000 --> 00:27:07,000
Hmun dang zawng aia tlawma
Air Tickets la duh tan

426
00:27:33,598 --> 00:27:36,135
Take the horses in back.
Give them something to eat.

427
00:27:38,170 --> 00:27:40,582
I want the gold-ware, not the silverware.

428
00:27:40,639 --> 00:27:41,879
Coming through to the kitchen.

429
00:27:41,940 --> 00:27:43,613
This is a royal occasion, not a picnic.

430
00:27:43,675 --> 00:27:44,676
Sorry, sir.

431
00:27:44,743 --> 00:27:46,051
Make it work, everyone.

432
00:27:46,111 --> 00:27:48,955
Sofia, how was school?

433
00:27:50,248 --> 00:27:52,353
I thought being a princess
would be easy.

434
00:27:52,417 --> 00:27:55,057
- But it's really hard.
- Hmm.

435
00:27:55,120 --> 00:27:56,599
I know just what you need.

436
00:27:58,623 --> 00:28:00,330
Jade! Ruby!

437
00:28:00,392 --> 00:28:02,633
I thought you could use
some familiar faces.

438
00:28:02,694 --> 00:28:03,729
Thanks, Mom!

439
00:28:03,795 --> 00:28:07,004
Jade! Ruby! I'm so glad to see you.

440
00:28:07,065 --> 00:28:08,772
Hi, Sofia!

441
00:28:09,001 --> 00:28:11,504
- How many gowns do you have?
- Uh... Lots.

442
00:28:11,570 --> 00:28:14,278
- We've really missed you, Sofia.
- I've missed you, too.

443
00:28:14,339 --> 00:28:15,613
Oh, how many tiaras?

444
00:28:15,674 --> 00:28:17,676
Five. No, six.

445
00:28:18,710 --> 00:28:19,882
Oh.

446
00:28:19,945 --> 00:28:21,754
Here. Let me help you with that.

447
00:28:21,813 --> 00:28:24,089
Prince James.

448
00:28:24,182 --> 00:28:25,684
What are you doing here?

449
00:28:25,784 --> 00:28:28,287
I'm sorry. I've been a royal dunce.

450
00:28:28,353 --> 00:28:30,333
- But I want to make it up to you.
- How?

451
00:28:30,389 --> 00:28:34,895
Well, by teaching you all the royal stuff
you need to know for the ball.

452
00:28:34,960 --> 00:28:37,964
We can start with how to pour
the perfect cup of tea.

453
00:28:44,469 --> 00:28:47,177
Prince James poured me tea!

454
00:28:50,175 --> 00:28:52,086
Best curtsey I've seen all year.

455
00:28:52,210 --> 00:28:53,689
You're all set for the ball now.

456
00:28:53,745 --> 00:28:55,554
My work here is done.

457
00:28:55,614 --> 00:28:58,390
- There is one more thing.
- What?

458
00:28:58,617 --> 00:29:00,028
I can't dance.

459
00:29:00,085 --> 00:29:01,894
Is that all? No problem.

460
00:29:01,953 --> 00:29:04,229
We have dance class
with Professor Popov tomorrow.

461
00:29:04,322 --> 00:29:06,063
But the ball is tomorrow night.

462
00:29:06,124 --> 00:29:09,697
One class with Popov and you'll be
dancing circles around all of us.

463
00:29:09,761 --> 00:29:12,071
Trust me. Okay?

464
00:29:12,130 --> 00:29:13,609
Okay.

465
00:29:27,112 --> 00:29:30,650
Sofia, don't even think about touching
those stinky shoes.

466
00:29:30,715 --> 00:29:33,059
I brought an extra pair just for you.

467
00:29:33,118 --> 00:29:35,029
Thanks, Amber.

468
00:29:35,087 --> 00:29:38,899
You're very welcome.
Now, hurry up and get ready.

469
00:29:44,963 --> 00:29:47,170
Children, gather round.

470
00:29:48,133 --> 00:29:52,343
So you think you can waltz, eh?

471
00:29:55,807 --> 00:29:59,016
We shall see about that.

472
00:29:59,077 --> 00:30:01,057
I need volunteer!

473
00:30:01,880 --> 00:30:02,881
Mmm.

474
00:30:03,048 --> 00:30:05,119
New girl. Excellent. Pop-pop-pop.

475
00:30:05,183 --> 00:30:08,187
Follow my lead. If you dare.

476
00:30:23,101 --> 00:30:24,102
Mmm.

477
00:30:26,304 --> 00:30:27,977
Oh!

478
00:30:33,512 --> 00:30:37,358
What's going on?

479
00:30:38,083 --> 00:30:39,221
Whoa!

480
00:31:11,416 --> 00:31:13,362
Oh.

481
00:31:15,487 --> 00:31:16,488
Uh.

482
00:31:28,500 --> 00:31:33,279
Oh, Sofia. I must have grabbed a pair of
Cedric's trick shoes by mistake.

483
00:31:33,338 --> 00:31:36,251
He's always leaving his stuff
lying around the castle.

484
00:31:36,308 --> 00:31:38,049
Sorry about that.

485
00:31:38,109 --> 00:31:39,747
Coachman, can we get going?

486
00:31:39,811 --> 00:31:41,256
The ball starts in four hours.

487
00:31:41,313 --> 00:31:43,554
I'll barely have enough time
to get dressed.

488
00:31:54,826 --> 00:31:56,464
Ah. Princess Sofia.

489
00:31:56,528 --> 00:31:58,974
The ballroom is almost ready.

490
00:32:10,809 --> 00:32:12,720
It's beautiful.

491
00:32:12,777 --> 00:32:15,348
There's only one thing missing.

492
00:32:15,413 --> 00:32:16,915
A princess.

493
00:32:16,982 --> 00:32:19,258
It's your time to shine, Sofia.

494
00:32:19,317 --> 00:32:22,560
And I can't wait to see your first waltz.

495
00:32:24,422 --> 00:32:27,869
<i>I know. Mr. Ceedric.</i>

496
00:32:36,134 --> 00:32:38,114
- Hmm?
- Oh, Mr. Ceedric?

497
00:32:38,169 --> 00:32:40,775
- Hi!
- It's Cedric.

498
00:32:40,839 --> 00:32:43,410
- May I come in?
- Must you?

499
00:32:44,943 --> 00:32:46,513
What is it?

500
00:32:46,578 --> 00:32:50,151
Remember how you said
if I ever needed any help?

501
00:32:50,215 --> 00:32:52,195
Of course I remember.
I was the one who said it.

502
00:32:52,250 --> 00:32:54,526
Well, I was wondering,

503
00:32:54,586 --> 00:32:57,089
do you have a spell that
can make me a good dancer?

504
00:32:57,155 --> 00:32:58,793
It's for the ball tonight.

505
00:32:58,857 --> 00:33:01,565
I don't want to look silly
in front of everyone.

506
00:33:01,860 --> 00:33:02,895
Mmm?

507
00:33:03,628 --> 00:33:04,663
Mmm.

508
00:33:04,729 --> 00:33:08,472
Yes. Everyone will be there.

509
00:33:08,767 --> 00:33:11,543
I have just the spell for you.

510
00:33:18,243 --> 00:33:19,654
Yes, I do.

511
00:33:19,711 --> 00:33:21,952
And here we are.

512
00:33:23,181 --> 00:33:25,320
No, no, no. Not now!

513
00:33:25,383 --> 00:33:27,590
You must wait until the waltz begins.

514
00:33:27,652 --> 00:33:30,326
Then just say those three magic words

515
00:33:30,388 --> 00:33:33,801
and you'll become the best dancer
in the kingdom.

516
00:33:33,858 --> 00:33:35,428
Thanks, Mr. Ceedric.

517
00:33:35,493 --> 00:33:37,336
I don't know what I'd do without you.

518
00:33:38,697 --> 00:33:40,267
That makes two of us.

519
00:33:42,133 --> 00:33:43,271
Oh, come on.

520
00:33:43,335 --> 00:33:46,782
You didn't really think
I gave her a dancing spell, did you?

521
00:33:47,639 --> 00:33:50,415
When she utters the magic words
I gave her,

522
00:33:50,475 --> 00:33:53,456
everyone in the ballroom
will fall into a deep sleep,

523
00:33:53,511 --> 00:33:55,991
even her dear old mom and dad.

524
00:33:56,047 --> 00:34:00,052
And I'll only wake them up
if she hands over the amulet.

525
00:34:00,118 --> 00:34:05,158
And then the kingdom will be mine!

526
00:34:15,200 --> 00:34:16,543
You look lovely, Miss Amber.

527
00:34:16,634 --> 00:34:18,341
Perfect as usual.

528
00:34:18,903 --> 00:34:21,144
I need to talk to my sister. Alone.

529
00:34:21,406 --> 00:34:22,544
Mmm-hmm.

530
00:34:24,609 --> 00:34:25,644
How do I look?

531
00:34:25,710 --> 00:34:27,917
You gave Sofia the trick shoes
on purpose.

532
00:34:27,979 --> 00:34:30,926
If I recall,
you played a prank on her, too.

533
00:34:30,982 --> 00:34:34,054
What you did wasn't a prank.
She needed those dance lessons.

534
00:34:34,119 --> 00:34:36,690
You're trying to ruin her ball.
And I know why.

535
00:34:36,755 --> 00:34:38,359
Because she doesn't belong here?

536
00:34:38,423 --> 00:34:40,926
No. Because everyone likes her
more than you.

537
00:34:40,992 --> 00:34:43,165
And after what you did today, so do I.

538
00:34:43,228 --> 00:34:46,368
- You don't mean that.
- Yes, I do.

539
00:34:49,734 --> 00:34:52,510
Wait. James! Come back!

540
00:34:54,105 --> 00:34:55,106
Oh.

541
00:34:56,274 --> 00:34:58,049
MY gown!

542
00:34:58,109 --> 00:35:00,589
Suzette! Marcie!

543
00:35:03,481 --> 00:35:06,189
Look at you, Princess Sofia.

544
00:35:06,251 --> 00:35:07,662
Pretty, pretty, pretty.

545
00:35:07,719 --> 00:35:10,723
- Sofia! You look beautiful!
- You look gorgeous.

546
00:35:10,789 --> 00:35:13,065
Prettiest princess in the palace.

547
00:35:25,170 --> 00:35:27,912
All hail Princess Sofia.

548
00:35:54,499 --> 00:35:56,570
- Sofia.
- Your Majesty.

549
00:36:03,341 --> 00:36:06,550
It's almost sleepy time!

550
00:36:16,321 --> 00:36:17,493
Shall we dance?

551
00:36:18,656 --> 00:36:21,136
Somnibus Populi Cella.

552
00:36:31,469 --> 00:36:32,539
What?

553
00:36:41,112 --> 00:36:42,420
It's working.

554
00:36:42,480 --> 00:36:46,485
Soon everyone in the ballroom
will be asleep.

555
00:36:46,551 --> 00:36:48,224
Oh, no!

556
00:36:54,392 --> 00:36:58,135
Mom? Mom? I must have said it wrong.

557
00:36:58,196 --> 00:36:59,698
Please wake up.

558
00:37:00,198 --> 00:37:05,113
Help! Help! Help! Someone. Anyone.

559
00:37:05,169 --> 00:37:06,944
Mr. Ceedric?

560
00:37:08,439 --> 00:37:12,888
Guards? Suzette? Marcie? Help!

561
00:37:13,878 --> 00:37:15,687
What have I done?

562
00:37:25,223 --> 00:37:28,227
Cinderella? What are you doing here?

563
00:37:28,293 --> 00:37:30,170
Your amulet brought me here.

564
00:37:30,228 --> 00:37:33,209
It links all the princesses that ever were.

565
00:37:33,264 --> 00:37:36,643
And when one of us is in trouble,
another will come to help.

566
00:37:36,701 --> 00:37:38,977
Why are you so sad, Sofia?

567
00:37:39,037 --> 00:37:43,315
I tried to use a magic spell
to make myself a good dancer,

568
00:37:43,374 --> 00:37:45,911
but it put everyone to sleep.

569
00:37:46,044 --> 00:37:48,456
I should have just let them laugh at me.

570
00:37:49,013 --> 00:37:50,390
Can you undo the spell?

571
00:37:51,082 --> 00:37:53,119
Only you can do that.

572
00:37:53,184 --> 00:37:56,597
But I think I can help you find your way.

573
00:37:59,390 --> 00:38:05,136
<i>Everyone's heard about the day
that true love came for me</i>

574
00:38:05,363 --> 00:38:11,109
<i>He carried me off and far away
from my stepfamily</i>

575
00:38:11,269 --> 00:38:17,151
<i>But ever since I wed the prince
and left my hurt behind</i>

576
00:38:17,208 --> 00:38:24,183
<i>There's one regret! won't forget
that weighs upon my mind</i>

577
00:38:26,317 --> 00:38:32,131
<i>My stepsisters let their jealousy
harden their heart</i>

578
00:38:32,390 --> 00:38:38,033
<i>But when they ruined my ball gown
that's not all they tore apart</i>

579
00:38:38,096 --> 00:38:44,240
<i>If only we had tried to see
a way to start anew</i>

580
00:38:44,302 --> 00:38:47,374
<i>We may have found
that this time 'round</i>

581
00:38:47,438 --> 00:38:52,387
<i>Our friendship only grew</i>

582
00:38:52,543 --> 00:38:56,150
<i>We could have been true sisters</i>

583
00:38:56,214 --> 00:38:59,525
<i>If we only made amends</i>

584
00:38:59,584 --> 00:39:02,690
<i>True, true sisters</i>

585
00:39:03,788 --> 00:39:10,763
<i>And ever after friends</i>

586
00:39:12,830 --> 00:39:18,371
<i>You suddenly feel that all is lost
Frightened and alone</i>

587
00:39:18,670 --> 00:39:24,780
<i>But maybe yours isn't the only heart
That's sinking like a stone</i>

588
00:39:24,876 --> 00:39:30,758
<i>Though many of the ones you love are
frozen in a trance</i>

589
00:39:30,815 --> 00:39:37,323
<i>Someone who's a lot like you
never made it to the dance</i>

590
00:39:39,524 --> 00:39:41,526
But Amber's been so mean to me.

591
00:39:41,592 --> 00:39:45,233
Perhaps all she needs
is a second chance.

592
00:39:45,296 --> 00:39:49,142
<i>- You could be true sisters
- Sisters</i>

593
00:39:49,200 --> 00:39:52,079
<i>If you only make amends</i>

594
00:39:52,136 --> 00:39:56,551
<i>True, true sisters</i>

595
00:39:56,607 --> 00:39:59,281
<i>Sisters</i>

596
00:39:59,343 --> 00:40:06,261
<i>And ever after</i>

597
00:40:06,317 --> 00:40:13,292
<i>Friends</i>

598
00:40:34,679 --> 00:40:36,056
What do you want?

599
00:40:36,114 --> 00:40:38,287
I've done something terrible.

600
00:40:38,349 --> 00:40:40,761
Come on, I'll show you.

601
00:40:45,323 --> 00:40:48,099
A dancing spell put everyone to sleep?

602
00:40:48,159 --> 00:40:51,572
I must have said it wrong.
It's all my fault.

603
00:40:53,264 --> 00:40:54,368
No, Sofia.

604
00:40:54,432 --> 00:40:57,777
You wouldn't have needed the spell
if I didn't give you those trick shoes.

605
00:40:57,835 --> 00:41:01,942
I was just jealous because
everyone likes you more than me.

606
00:41:02,240 --> 00:41:03,583
Even my own brother.

607
00:41:03,641 --> 00:41:07,714
That's not true. You're the most
popular princess at Royal Prep.

608
00:41:07,779 --> 00:41:09,816
You have no idea how happy I was

609
00:41:09,881 --> 00:41:12,691
when I found out
we were going to be stepsisters.

610
00:41:14,152 --> 00:41:17,258
Sofia, we're sisters.

611
00:41:23,528 --> 00:41:25,337
How are we gonna wake them up?

612
00:41:25,396 --> 00:41:26,397
Hmm.

613
00:41:26,464 --> 00:41:29,536
Oh, I bet Cedric has a counter-spell
in one of his books.

614
00:41:29,901 --> 00:41:32,177
Oh. But his workshop is always locked.

615
00:41:32,236 --> 00:41:34,216
Not if you have the key.

616
00:41:38,576 --> 00:41:40,021
Give me a boost.

617
00:41:44,415 --> 00:41:45,951
Got it.

618
00:41:52,523 --> 00:41:53,558
Whoa!

619
00:41:53,624 --> 00:41:55,228
I forgot about Wormwood.

620
00:41:55,293 --> 00:41:57,466
He won't let us get near the spell book.

621
00:41:57,528 --> 00:41:58,768
We'll need more help.

622
00:41:58,830 --> 00:42:00,741
From who? Everyone's asleep.

623
00:42:00,798 --> 00:42:02,709
Not everyone.

624
00:42:03,134 --> 00:42:05,580
- Just follow the plan.
- We have a plan?

625
00:42:07,238 --> 00:42:10,048
Hey. Those are the animals
that used to help me clean my room.

626
00:42:10,107 --> 00:42:11,950
I wondered what happened to them.

627
00:42:20,585 --> 00:42:21,859
Get his beak!

628
00:42:22,486 --> 00:42:23,794
Got it.

629
00:42:28,392 --> 00:42:30,394
Oh, you little...

630
00:42:30,695 --> 00:42:31,833
Ow! Ow! Ow!

631
00:42:31,896 --> 00:42:33,432
Take that, birdbrain!

632
00:42:33,497 --> 00:42:34,498
Stop it.

633
00:42:34,565 --> 00:42:36,567
- Get the spell book!
- Got it.

634
00:42:36,834 --> 00:42:37,904
Oh.

635
00:42:41,005 --> 00:42:43,144
Claws off my sister!

636
00:42:43,207 --> 00:42:46,711
Eye peck away. Get it.

637
00:42:47,979 --> 00:42:50,391
- Stop that!
- Amber, over here!

638
00:42:52,583 --> 00:42:54,062
Got him!

639
00:42:54,485 --> 00:42:56,021
All right, sports fans,

640
00:42:56,087 --> 00:42:58,567
that may be the first time
Amber's picked up a broom,

641
00:42:58,623 --> 00:43:01,297
but she sure knows how to use it.

642
00:43:01,792 --> 00:43:03,567
Let's find that counter-spell.

643
00:43:04,662 --> 00:43:06,505
Oh! Where is it?

644
00:43:06,564 --> 00:43:07,838
I don't know.

645
00:43:07,965 --> 00:43:09,774
Yo, Wormwood! Why so quiet?

646
00:43:09,834 --> 00:43:12,178
Worried we'll tell the other ravens
you got outsmarted by a rabbit?

647
00:43:12,236 --> 00:43:14,944
Hardly!
We'll see who has the last laugh.

648
00:43:15,006 --> 00:43:17,782
They'll never find the counter-spell.

649
00:43:17,842 --> 00:43:20,516
Oh, they've got your master's
spell book, birdbrain.

650
00:43:20,578 --> 00:43:24,890
But the counter-spell book is hidden
behind the painting.

651
00:43:24,949 --> 00:43:27,190
So the joke's on them.

652
00:43:27,985 --> 00:43:29,259
Thanks, Wormwood!

653
00:43:29,854 --> 00:43:32,130
She heard what I said? No!

654
00:43:32,189 --> 00:43:34,032
Found it. Let's go.

655
00:43:42,133 --> 00:43:44,977
- What's wrong?
- I can't go in there looking like this.

656
00:43:45,036 --> 00:43:47,607
- You go on.
- Not without you.

657
00:43:47,672 --> 00:43:48,878
Come on.

658
00:43:50,408 --> 00:43:52,979
I've been fixing my dolls' dresses
for years.

659
00:43:54,045 --> 00:43:56,321
There you go. Good as new.

660
00:43:59,216 --> 00:44:00,991
Thank you, Sofia.

661
00:44:01,519 --> 00:44:03,863
Guess I gotta go try to waltz now.

662
00:44:04,422 --> 00:44:07,460
Wait. There's something I can fix, too.

663
00:44:07,525 --> 00:44:09,300
I owe you a dance lesson.

664
00:44:09,794 --> 00:44:10,864
Oh.

665
00:44:13,164 --> 00:44:15,701
One, two, three. One, two, three.

666
00:44:15,766 --> 00:44:19,509
One, two, three. One, two, three.
One, two, three. One...

667
00:44:34,185 --> 00:44:36,859
Populi Cella Excitate.

668
00:44:41,258 --> 00:44:42,737
Amber, it's working.

669
00:44:47,965 --> 00:44:50,172
Sofia, are you ready?

670
00:44:50,468 --> 00:44:51,845
I am.

671
00:45:04,749 --> 00:45:06,990
Merlin's mushrooms!

672
00:45:11,055 --> 00:45:12,090
Ow!

673
00:45:12,156 --> 00:45:15,501
Sorry.
I'm afraid I'm not a very good dancer.

674
00:45:15,559 --> 00:45:18,301
I never paid much attention
in Popov's class.

675
00:45:18,362 --> 00:45:21,366
But you certainly did.
You dance wonderfully.

676
00:45:21,432 --> 00:45:22,934
Thank you, Your Majesty.

677
00:45:23,000 --> 00:45:25,002
I mean, Dad.

678
00:45:26,103 --> 00:45:28,083
I had a little extra help from Amber.

679
00:45:28,139 --> 00:45:31,018
- I taught her everything she knows.
- Huh?

680
00:45:34,578 --> 00:45:36,353
Mom, would you like to dance?

681
00:45:36,414 --> 00:45:37,984
Of course, James.

682
00:45:38,049 --> 00:45:39,050
Ooh.

683
00:45:40,451 --> 00:45:43,591
I've been wondering, why do they
call you "Roland the Second"?

684
00:45:43,654 --> 00:45:47,192
Because my father, the former king,
was also named Roland.

685
00:45:47,958 --> 00:45:51,462
So I guess that makes me
Sofia the First.

686
00:45:51,695 --> 00:45:53,868
I guess it does.

687
00:46:05,209 --> 00:46:06,415
Oh.
