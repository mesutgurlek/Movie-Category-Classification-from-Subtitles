1
00:01:44,950 --> 00:01:47,180
~~ Life is a tombola.
Tom tom tombola, ~~

2
00:01:47,252 --> 00:01:49,720
~~ Life is a tombola.
Tom tom tombola, ~~

3
00:01:49,788 --> 00:01:54,384
~~ of color and of light,
of color and of light. ~~

4
00:01:54,460 --> 00:01:56,655
~~ And every one in the tombola,
tom tom tombola. ~~

5
00:01:56,729 --> 00:01:59,289
~~ And every one in the tombola,
tom tom tombola, ~~

6
00:01:59,365 --> 00:02:02,129
~~ finds someone they can love. ~~

7
00:02:02,201 --> 00:02:03,031
~~ Tombola! ~~

8
00:02:04,503 --> 00:02:06,562
~~ In the tombola of the world, ~~

9
00:02:06,639 --> 00:02:09,039
~~ I've been very lucky. ~~

10
00:02:09,108 --> 00:02:13,545
~~ I bet all my affection on your
number. ~~

11
00:02:13,612 --> 00:02:18,242
~~ I dreamed of your name,
I was waiting to meet you... ~~

12
00:02:18,317 --> 00:02:23,118
~~ and the tombola of the world
rewarded me with your love. ~~

13
00:02:23,188 --> 00:02:25,156
~~ Life is a tombola.
Tom tom tombola, ~~

14
00:02:25,224 --> 00:02:27,658
~~ Life is a tombola.
Tom tom tombola, ~~

15
00:02:27,726 --> 00:02:32,493
~~ of color and of light,
of color and of light. ~~

16
00:02:32,564 --> 00:02:34,725
~~ And the rhythm of the
tombola, tom tom tombola, ~~

17
00:02:34,800 --> 00:02:37,268
~~ And the rhythm of the
tombola, tom tom tombola, ~~

18
00:02:37,336 --> 00:02:39,964
~~ carries me to your love. ~~

19
00:02:40,039 --> 00:02:41,131
~~ Tombola! ~~

20
00:02:47,312 --> 00:02:52,147
~~ In a forest in China, the little 
Chinese girl was lost. ~~

21
00:02:52,217 --> 00:02:57,245
~~ I was lost there too, and so each 
other we did find. ~~

22
00:03:04,430 --> 00:03:10,562
~~ Young lady, young lady,
yesterday you were just a child. ~~

23
00:03:10,636 --> 00:03:17,508
~~ And no matter what they say
you're all that a woman has to be. ~~

24
00:03:17,576 --> 00:03:24,607
~~ Young lady, young lady,
you started to show off. ~~

25
00:03:24,683 --> 00:03:29,848
~~ If you dress up and paint
up it's for me, and me, ~~

26
00:03:29,922 --> 00:03:31,514
~~ and me alone. ~~

27
00:03:31,590 --> 00:03:38,496
~~ That little girl is grown up
now and she wears stiletto heels. ~~

28
00:03:38,564 --> 00:03:42,694
~~ And when she crosses the city
the boys sing her song... ~~

29
00:03:42,768 --> 00:03:45,703
~~ as they pass her by. ~~

30
00:03:47,706 --> 00:03:55,010
~~ Young lady that I love,
young lady that I love. ~~

31
00:04:01,386 --> 00:04:08,315
~~ Young lady, young lady,
yesterday you were just a child. ~~

32
00:04:08,393 --> 00:04:16,027
~~ Like a gift from life, you're
a flower, you're the sun. ~~

33
00:04:16,101 --> 00:04:19,366
~~ and you're all that woman has to be. ~~

34
00:04:19,438 --> 00:04:22,498
~~ You're all that woman has to be. ~~

35
00:04:22,574 --> 00:04:26,203
~~ Young lady, you're all that a 
woman has to be. ~~

36
00:04:26,278 --> 00:04:30,146
~~ Young lady, you're all that a 
woman has to be. ~~

37
00:04:30,215 --> 00:04:32,149
~~ Young lady... ~~

38
00:04:32,217 --> 00:04:34,208
~~ I am all... ~~

39
00:04:42,895 --> 00:04:43,884
Tombola.

40
00:05:14,526 --> 00:05:19,964
~~ I want the moon that illuminates... ~~

41
00:05:22,201 --> 00:05:26,763
~~ your silhouette as you walk. ~~

42
00:05:29,942 --> 00:05:35,005
~~ With a ballerina's steps... ~~

43
00:05:37,816 --> 00:05:42,446
~~ you follow it, never looking. ~~

44
00:05:45,257 --> 00:05:51,196
~~ I want you to come full of love... ~~

45
00:05:53,198 --> 00:05:57,794
~~ and embrace me when you arrive. ~~

46
00:05:58,537 --> 00:06:05,101
"20 CENTIMETERS"

47
00:06:06,478 --> 00:06:13,281
~~ When you feel so lucky and
you laugh as you kiss. ~~

48
00:06:14,086 --> 00:06:15,610
Fucking hell!

49
00:06:16,855 --> 00:06:21,986
~~ I want the calm of the evening... ~~

50
00:06:24,563 --> 00:06:29,500
~~ when night begins to fall. ~~

51
00:06:32,304 --> 00:06:37,332
~~ It's the twilight that burns... ~~

52
00:06:39,811 --> 00:06:44,942
~~ as my love burns for you. ~~

53
00:06:47,753 --> 00:06:52,816
~~ I want your hand to guide me. ~~

54
00:06:53,458 --> 00:06:54,584
Thanks, love.

55
00:06:55,794 --> 00:07:01,255
~~ If I'm in the dark... ~~

56
00:07:22,187 --> 00:07:23,381
What's up?

57
00:07:23,455 --> 00:07:25,150
What's this, Tomas?

58
00:07:25,223 --> 00:07:28,215
It fell on top of me, I thought it 
was a coffin.

59
00:07:28,727 --> 00:07:30,217
It's bad luck!

60
00:07:33,231 --> 00:07:34,493
It's a cello, Marieta.

61
00:07:35,033 --> 00:07:37,194
- A what?
- A cello.

62
00:07:39,404 --> 00:07:41,429
I inherited it.

63
00:07:41,506 --> 00:07:43,565
Inherited it, peewee?

64
00:07:43,642 --> 00:07:45,507
You kept that quiet.

65
00:07:47,012 --> 00:07:48,809
My aunt Rafalita.

66
00:07:48,880 --> 00:07:52,008
She was very fond of me and she 
died suddenly.

67
00:07:52,084 --> 00:07:53,108
Rafalita?

68
00:07:56,188 --> 00:07:58,588
I think you invent your family as you 
go along...

69
00:07:58,657 --> 00:08:01,387
so that I can't argue back.

70
00:08:03,528 --> 00:08:05,860
The coffee's on, I'm going to the bank.

71
00:08:08,066 --> 00:08:10,000
My ass hurts, Tomas.

72
00:08:10,068 --> 00:08:14,402
I fell asleep again and I woke up out 
in the country.

73
00:08:14,473 --> 00:08:16,805
I felt like a bag of cement.

74
00:08:16,875 --> 00:08:18,672
It's pathetic.

75
00:08:18,744 --> 00:08:22,145
He saw I was out cold so he gave it 
to me up the ass.

76
00:08:22,214 --> 00:08:23,408
That costs more.

77
00:08:23,482 --> 00:08:28,078
Recently, there are more
clients asking you to play dead.

78
00:08:28,153 --> 00:08:29,711
The other girls told me.

79
00:08:45,637 --> 00:08:47,366
What'll you do with something so big?

80
00:08:48,707 --> 00:08:50,004
Learn to play it.

81
00:08:50,075 --> 00:08:52,873
You know how much a class for that 
guitar would cost?

82
00:08:52,944 --> 00:08:54,536
Do you?

83
00:08:56,348 --> 00:08:57,815
Not talking?

84
00:08:57,883 --> 00:09:00,010
You're keeping very quiet.

85
00:09:00,085 --> 00:09:02,610
It'd cost an arm and a leg.

86
00:09:02,687 --> 00:09:03,449
My arm and leg.

87
00:09:08,427 --> 00:09:12,830
So, things were bad enough and 
aunt Rafalita didn't help.

88
00:09:17,836 --> 00:09:19,201
A kilo of carrots.

89
00:09:19,271 --> 00:09:22,138
A bunch of grapes for white gazpacho,

90
00:09:22,207 --> 00:09:24,937
and I need some garlic too.

91
00:09:25,010 --> 00:09:28,969
Hey, kiddo, you look very pretty.

92
00:09:29,047 --> 00:09:30,947
She looks like a slut.

93
00:09:32,751 --> 00:09:34,309
You gotta look good.

94
00:09:34,386 --> 00:09:35,978
Did you want zucchini?

95
00:09:36,054 --> 00:09:39,717
She says a director'll pass by one day 
and put her in a movie.

96
00:09:40,992 --> 00:09:42,721
You like these two?

97
00:09:42,794 --> 00:09:44,352
Lovely, aren't they?

98
00:09:45,664 --> 00:09:48,565
Our mother, God rest her, always said:

99
00:09:48,633 --> 00:09:50,999
Garlic every day keeps troubles away.

100
00:09:51,069 --> 00:09:54,630
And look at you now, a spinster with 
bad breath.

101
00:09:56,074 --> 00:10:01,137
My grandma peeled them and used
them as suppositories for worms.

102
00:10:01,213 --> 00:10:03,272
Yeah, for everything.

103
00:10:03,348 --> 00:10:06,374
If you mash them in a poultice they 
cure bunions.

104
00:10:06,451 --> 00:10:08,681
- And grapes?
- A bunch.

105
00:10:08,753 --> 00:10:10,277
These customers are a pain in the ass.

106
00:10:10,355 --> 00:10:13,119
You've just got a hangover.
Know what time she came home?

107
00:10:13,191 --> 00:10:14,453
At no time.

108
00:10:14,526 --> 00:10:17,689
She came straight here, didn't even 
get changed.

109
00:10:17,762 --> 00:10:19,662
She stinks to high heaven.

110
00:10:19,731 --> 00:10:23,565
Hey, how was the concert?
Tell me about it.

111
00:10:23,635 --> 00:10:26,900
Well... it was no big deal.

112
00:10:28,240 --> 00:10:30,140
Like a bride's first night.

113
00:10:32,978 --> 00:10:35,606
Rebecca, have you got almonds?

114
00:10:40,385 --> 00:10:42,012
A-S-S.

115
00:10:51,696 --> 00:10:52,958
Look at his ass!

116
00:10:53,031 --> 00:10:54,931
It's like a peach.

117
00:11:12,951 --> 00:11:16,318
Rebecca, that's everything.
What do I owe you?

118
00:11:17,589 --> 00:11:18,613
What did you want, ma'am?

119
00:11:23,395 --> 00:11:25,363
- I'm off, ladies.
- So long, Marieta.

120
00:11:46,484 --> 00:11:47,542
Marieta!

121
00:11:54,759 --> 00:11:55,691
Marieta!

122
00:12:03,935 --> 00:12:05,732
Brazil!

123
00:12:05,804 --> 00:12:08,238
It's all love and sex down there.

124
00:12:08,306 --> 00:12:09,864
That's why the place is thriving.

125
00:12:09,941 --> 00:12:12,603
- What do you want?
- The usual, love.

126
00:12:12,677 --> 00:12:14,611
I'm on night shift and Paulito will 
only stay...

127
00:12:14,679 --> 00:12:16,306
with his aunt Marieta.

128
00:12:17,716 --> 00:12:19,240
How are you, Pili?

129
00:12:19,317 --> 00:12:20,750
It's hot up here.

130
00:12:20,819 --> 00:12:23,720
Don't lean out too far, you'll fall 
down the shaft.

131
00:12:23,788 --> 00:12:25,312
Don't worry, love.

132
00:12:25,390 --> 00:12:27,984
- Any word of a wedding?
- Yeah, any day!

133
00:12:30,595 --> 00:12:33,063
Brazil's the place for weddings.

134
00:12:33,131 --> 00:12:35,326
There's everything there.

135
00:12:35,400 --> 00:12:37,265
And plenty of men.

136
00:12:37,335 --> 00:12:38,825
We'd have 4 or 5 each.

137
00:12:42,474 --> 00:12:44,635
It's true, I'm not joking.

138
00:12:44,709 --> 00:12:47,337
The best beaches, the best cocks,

139
00:12:47,412 --> 00:12:50,313
the best doctors for you, to cut off 
your whatsit.

140
00:12:50,382 --> 00:12:52,509
The rich get operated there.

141
00:12:52,584 --> 00:12:54,609
Don't give me any crazy ideas,

142
00:12:54,686 --> 00:12:56,210
or I'll start getting flaky.

143
00:12:57,589 --> 00:12:59,853
Down there, even we'd be rich.

144
00:12:59,924 --> 00:13:01,858
This sandwich is great.

145
00:13:01,926 --> 00:13:04,724
It's got the best salami.

146
00:13:04,796 --> 00:13:06,093
Hey!

147
00:13:06,164 --> 00:13:08,029
Don't hang your washing now!

148
00:13:08,099 --> 00:13:09,999
We won't even see the sky!

149
00:13:10,068 --> 00:13:12,127
What do you want me to do?

150
00:13:12,203 --> 00:13:13,761
I have to dry it somewhere.

151
00:13:13,838 --> 00:13:15,703
Your sister took in those clothes 
this morning,

152
00:13:15,774 --> 00:13:16,968
I saw her!

153
00:13:17,042 --> 00:13:18,771
You're just being nosey!

154
00:13:18,843 --> 00:13:21,539
What's it to you, you fat, ugly, old hag!

155
00:13:21,613 --> 00:13:24,047
Every time you and your sister stick 
your heads out,

156
00:13:24,115 --> 00:13:26,379
you're like Punch and Judy.

157
00:13:26,451 --> 00:13:29,249
Go fuck yourself,
because no one else will!

158
00:13:29,321 --> 00:13:30,720
Fleabag!

159
00:13:30,789 --> 00:13:32,916
You're always bitching at us.

160
00:13:32,991 --> 00:13:34,652
We'll come down and...

161
00:13:34,726 --> 00:13:36,785
Stop it, Berta, you're needling them.

162
00:13:36,861 --> 00:13:38,351
It cheers me up.

163
00:13:38,430 --> 00:13:40,125
Naturally big!

164
00:13:41,199 --> 00:13:42,723
And your son is always wandering...

165
00:13:42,801 --> 00:13:43,961
Shut up, you whores!

166
00:13:44,035 --> 00:13:46,401
I don't inject gasoline in my ass!

167
00:13:46,838 --> 00:13:47,862
We're so sick of you.

168
00:13:48,273 --> 00:13:51,299
My sister and I are going to beat 
the shit out of you.

169
00:13:51,376 --> 00:13:53,435
There's another one.

170
00:13:53,511 --> 00:13:54,978
Bitch, what was that?

171
00:13:55,046 --> 00:13:57,207
Was it your cat's piss?

172
00:13:57,282 --> 00:14:00,877
We're going to strangle your dog 
and hang it on your door.

173
00:14:00,952 --> 00:14:01,782
Berta.

174
00:14:01,853 --> 00:14:02,717
You old hag.

175
00:14:03,421 --> 00:14:04,285
I'm off.

176
00:14:04,356 --> 00:14:06,654
Come on, insult Candelaria a bit.

177
00:14:06,725 --> 00:14:07,783
She won't feel so lonely.

178
00:14:10,462 --> 00:14:12,953
You're the slut, Candelaria!

179
00:14:13,031 --> 00:14:14,828
Your mother was a whore!

180
00:14:14,899 --> 00:14:16,958
She nursed you on sour milk!

181
00:14:17,035 --> 00:14:22,302
We're going to burn you out and 
you'll rot on the street.

182
00:14:22,374 --> 00:14:22,897
Sluts.

183
00:14:23,541 --> 00:14:24,371
Old rat bag.

184
00:14:29,080 --> 00:14:30,377
I'll bring the kid down.

185
00:14:36,721 --> 00:14:39,053
It's a lot of money.

186
00:14:39,124 --> 00:14:40,682
But it's a dead certificate.

187
00:14:40,759 --> 00:14:43,250
That's why the initial investment 
is high.

188
00:14:43,328 --> 00:14:45,796
I'd have to postpone my operation,

189
00:14:45,864 --> 00:14:48,594
and I'd planned 
it for a year from now, at most.

190
00:14:49,567 --> 00:14:52,434
No, because during the opera
season we'll get our money back...

191
00:14:52,504 --> 00:14:54,369
three times over.

192
00:14:57,709 --> 00:14:58,835
Let's see.

193
00:14:58,910 --> 00:15:01,845
How are you going to get the tickets, 
the boxes,

194
00:15:01,913 --> 00:15:04,780
those season tickets?

195
00:15:04,849 --> 00:15:07,044
That's all controlled.

196
00:15:07,118 --> 00:15:08,847
It's taken care of.

197
00:15:08,920 --> 00:15:12,287
All we need is the money so
I can start selling them.

198
00:15:12,357 --> 00:15:14,348
Scalping is very tricky.

199
00:15:16,561 --> 00:15:17,994
What's up, love?

200
00:15:18,062 --> 00:15:18,994
Don't you like "rosbife"?

201
00:15:20,565 --> 00:15:21,998
It's delicious.

202
00:15:22,066 --> 00:15:24,227
Ass licker!
It tastes like rubber!

203
00:15:24,302 --> 00:15:26,361
You were late and I had to reheat it!

204
00:15:28,807 --> 00:15:33,176
The game is half over.
I'm going to get ready.

205
00:15:33,244 --> 00:15:33,972
Mari...

206
00:15:34,045 --> 00:15:35,740
Don't give me a hard time.

207
00:15:35,814 --> 00:15:36,906
I have to think about it.

208
00:16:31,336 --> 00:16:35,170
It's strange, I don't
know what's wrong with me,

209
00:16:35,240 --> 00:16:38,471
I'm seeing you as if it were the 
first time.

210
00:16:38,543 --> 00:16:44,743
~~ Words again, always words, 
the same old words. ~~

211
00:16:44,816 --> 00:16:45,942
I don't know how to tell you.

212
00:16:46,017 --> 00:16:49,885
~~ Only words. ~~

213
00:16:49,954 --> 00:16:53,185
But you're the beautiful
love story I'll never stop reading.

214
00:16:53,258 --> 00:16:59,356
~~ Easy words, pleasing words.
It was all too lovely, ~~

215
00:16:59,430 --> 00:17:01,295
You're my yesterday and tomorrow.

216
00:17:01,366 --> 00:17:05,268
~~... by far too lovely. ~~

217
00:17:05,336 --> 00:17:08,430
forever my only truth.

218
00:17:08,506 --> 00:17:13,307
~~ But the time for dreams is over. ~~

219
00:17:13,378 --> 00:17:19,908
~~ Memories wither too when they're 
forgotten. ~~

220
00:17:19,984 --> 00:17:23,351
You're like the wind that makes the 
violins sing...

221
00:17:23,421 --> 00:17:25,685
and carries the scent of roses far away.

222
00:17:26,324 --> 00:17:30,761
~~ Candy bars, sweets and chocolate. ~~

223
00:17:30,828 --> 00:17:33,023
At times I don't understand you.

224
00:17:33,097 --> 00:17:39,593
~~ Thanks, but not for me, you
can give them to another... ~~

225
00:17:39,671 --> 00:17:43,937
~~ who likes the wind, the scent 
of roses. ~~

226
00:17:44,008 --> 00:17:53,315
~~ Gentle, honeyed words stay in
my mouth, never in my heart. ~~

227
00:17:53,384 --> 00:17:55,249
One more word.

228
00:17:55,320 --> 00:17:58,778
~~ Words, words, words. ~~

229
00:17:58,856 --> 00:17:59,652
Listen to me.

230
00:17:59,724 --> 00:18:02,090
~~ Words, words, words. ~~

231
00:18:02,160 --> 00:18:03,252
I beg you.

232
00:18:03,328 --> 00:18:06,456
~~ Words, words, words. ~~

233
00:18:06,531 --> 00:18:16,839
~~ Words, words, words, more words
that you throw to the wind. ~~

234
00:18:25,116 --> 00:18:28,381
This is my fate, to talk to you.

235
00:18:28,453 --> 00:18:30,011
To talk to you like the first time.

236
00:18:31,322 --> 00:18:37,227
~~ More words, always words, 
the same words. ~~

237
00:18:37,295 --> 00:18:38,990
If only you could understand.

238
00:18:39,063 --> 00:18:42,863
~~ Only words. ~~

239
00:18:42,934 --> 00:18:44,595
If only you'd listen, at least once.

240
00:18:46,904 --> 00:18:52,433
~~ Magical words, tactical words, 
that sound false. ~~

241
00:18:52,510 --> 00:18:54,444
You're my forbidden dream.

242
00:18:54,512 --> 00:18:58,744
~~ Yes, so false. ~~

243
00:18:58,816 --> 00:19:00,909
My only torment and my only hope.

244
00:19:02,120 --> 00:19:06,489
~~ Nothing stops you when you start. ~~

245
00:19:06,557 --> 00:19:14,089
~~ If you knew how much I need a 
bit of silence. ~~

246
00:19:14,165 --> 00:19:17,566
For me, you're the only music that 
makes the stars...

247
00:19:17,635 --> 00:19:19,432
dance above the dunes.

248
00:19:19,504 --> 00:19:24,339
~~ Candy bars, sweets and chocolate. ~~

249
00:19:24,409 --> 00:19:26,741
If you didn't exist, I'd invent you.

250
00:19:26,811 --> 00:19:32,681
~~ Thanks, but not for me, you
can give them to another ~~

251
00:19:32,750 --> 00:19:37,278
~~ who likes stars above the dunes. ~~

252
00:19:37,355 --> 00:19:46,457
~~ Gentle, honeyed words stay in
my mouth, never in my heart. ~~

253
00:19:46,531 --> 00:19:48,658
Another word, just one.

254
00:19:48,733 --> 00:19:51,668
~~ Words, words, words. ~~

255
00:19:51,736 --> 00:19:52,634
Listen to me.

256
00:19:52,704 --> 00:19:55,332
~~ Words, words, words. ~~

257
00:19:55,406 --> 00:19:56,464
I beg you.

258
00:19:56,541 --> 00:19:59,135
~~ Words, words, words. ~~

259
00:19:59,210 --> 00:20:00,199
I swear.

260
00:20:00,278 --> 00:20:09,585
~~ Words, words, words, more words
that you throw to the wind. ~~

261
00:20:09,654 --> 00:20:11,417
You're so lovely!

262
00:20:11,489 --> 00:20:14,515
~~ Words, words, words. ~~

263
00:20:14,592 --> 00:20:15,718
You're so lovely!

264
00:20:15,793 --> 00:20:18,318
~~ Words, words, words. ~~

265
00:20:18,396 --> 00:20:19,488
You're so lovely!

266
00:20:19,564 --> 00:20:22,192
~~ Words, words, words. ~~

267
00:20:22,266 --> 00:20:23,290
You're so lovely!

268
00:20:23,367 --> 00:20:26,996
~~ Words, words, words. ~~

269
00:20:27,071 --> 00:20:34,978
~~ More words that you throw to 
the wind. ~~

270
00:21:09,547 --> 00:21:10,479
That's Marieta.

271
00:21:34,438 --> 00:21:35,962
You scared me!

272
00:21:36,040 --> 00:21:39,066
You were lying there like a stiff.

273
00:21:39,143 --> 00:21:41,043
What time is it?

274
00:21:41,112 --> 00:21:42,977
4:30.

275
00:21:43,047 --> 00:21:45,515
Aw, shit!

276
00:21:45,583 --> 00:21:48,484
I fell asleep again and
missed the fucking rush hour.

277
00:21:48,553 --> 00:21:50,453
What rush hour?

278
00:21:50,521 --> 00:21:55,891
When they get out of the soccer
game they're all horny as hell.

279
00:21:55,960 --> 00:21:59,088
- I bet you cleaned up.
- You'd better believe it.

280
00:21:59,163 --> 00:22:01,461
Three leg-overs and three pairs 
of blow jobs.

281
00:22:01,532 --> 00:22:02,396
Look.

282
00:22:04,001 --> 00:22:05,730
You had time for all that?

283
00:22:05,803 --> 00:22:07,065
You're a killer.

284
00:22:07,138 --> 00:22:07,763
At your age!

285
00:22:07,839 --> 00:22:09,397
I had five from
Real Madrid in one car,

286
00:22:09,473 --> 00:22:10,770
and sucked them all off.

287
00:22:11,742 --> 00:22:13,175
That means they won.

288
00:22:13,244 --> 00:22:14,643
They were really happy.

289
00:22:14,712 --> 00:22:16,043
High as kites.

290
00:22:16,113 --> 00:22:19,605
I gave them a special price and did 
it all in one car.

291
00:22:20,585 --> 00:22:23,076
This narcolepsy is shit.

292
00:22:23,154 --> 00:22:25,884
I just fucking pass out anywhere.

293
00:22:25,957 --> 00:22:27,356
What is it?

294
00:22:27,425 --> 00:22:29,757
A very rare disease.

295
00:22:29,827 --> 00:22:33,695
I get sleepy and then I pass out 
wherever I am.

296
00:22:33,764 --> 00:22:34,992
That's venereal.

297
00:22:35,066 --> 00:22:38,558
They said I should always have 
someone with me.

298
00:22:38,636 --> 00:22:41,799
Shit, I've always been so independent.

299
00:22:41,873 --> 00:22:44,103
I was leaving but...

300
00:22:44,175 --> 00:22:46,507
if you want I'll stay a while.

301
00:22:46,577 --> 00:22:48,374
I don't want you getting wobbly.

302
00:23:04,795 --> 00:23:05,762
There's Bunny.

303
00:23:11,903 --> 00:23:15,066
She says she makes good money 
with that routine.

304
00:23:15,139 --> 00:23:16,299
Like it?

305
00:23:16,374 --> 00:23:19,207
Yeah, I know you all do.

306
00:23:19,277 --> 00:23:20,471
Wait, I'll get in.

307
00:23:20,544 --> 00:23:22,774
Sure, you like to look, then what?

308
00:23:22,847 --> 00:23:24,974
She thinks turning tricks is like being 
in a play.

309
00:23:32,089 --> 00:23:35,422
Hey, you know 
I'm having my operation next year?

310
00:23:35,493 --> 00:23:36,517
God willing.

311
00:23:36,594 --> 00:23:39,222
Why? Your pecker is what earns 
the money.

312
00:23:39,297 --> 00:23:41,026
Because after the operation
I'm quitting the game,

313
00:23:41,098 --> 00:23:42,429
that's why.

314
00:23:42,500 --> 00:23:45,560
I said that ten years ago when I got 
rid of Puppy.

315
00:23:45,636 --> 00:23:47,900
Yeah, but you're illiterate.

316
00:23:49,006 --> 00:23:50,405
Who's Puppy?

317
00:23:50,474 --> 00:23:51,441
My pecker, Puppy.

318
00:23:52,877 --> 00:23:55,141
Come on, calling it Puppy...

319
00:23:55,212 --> 00:23:57,305
What about Carla?

320
00:23:57,381 --> 00:24:00,009
She called it "Pinch", like a pinch 
of salt.

321
00:24:01,953 --> 00:24:04,046
What did Charete call it?

322
00:24:04,121 --> 00:24:07,454
"Cochombo", like that private
detective, "Cochombo".

323
00:24:08,659 --> 00:24:11,127
Yeah, but mine runs in the family.

324
00:24:11,195 --> 00:24:14,062
The Carpantas have very thick, long, 
hard dicks.

325
00:24:21,739 --> 00:24:22,228
What's so funny?

326
00:24:25,977 --> 00:24:28,343
What did you have?
A little worm?

327
00:24:28,412 --> 00:24:30,880
- Something ridiculous?
- A button.

328
00:24:32,883 --> 00:24:34,248
It was horrible.

329
00:24:34,318 --> 00:24:35,785
Disgusting and embarrassing.

330
00:24:41,926 --> 00:24:44,417
Since my operation ten years ago,

331
00:24:44,495 --> 00:24:47,658
I feel nothing down there.

332
00:24:47,732 --> 00:24:49,893
Neither good nor bad.

333
00:24:49,967 --> 00:24:50,865
Nothing.

334
00:24:52,903 --> 00:24:56,031
But you had your operation in the 
Stone Age.

335
00:24:56,107 --> 00:24:57,802
Things have changed a lot.

336
00:24:57,875 --> 00:25:00,708
No one recovers from having their 
dangler cut off.

337
00:25:00,778 --> 00:25:03,542
The ones who say they feel like a 
woman say it so...

338
00:25:03,614 --> 00:25:05,878
as not to look stupid.

339
00:25:05,950 --> 00:25:07,781
But it's a lie.

340
00:25:17,261 --> 00:25:18,956
No more tricks tonight.

341
00:25:19,030 --> 00:25:20,292
Sweetheart!

342
00:25:20,364 --> 00:25:22,491
Are you getting wobbly again?

343
00:25:22,566 --> 00:25:23,965
Are you upset?

344
00:25:25,669 --> 00:25:27,728
Is it because of Puppy?

345
00:25:27,805 --> 00:25:30,296
Did I scare you?

346
00:25:30,374 --> 00:25:32,069
Come on!

347
00:25:32,143 --> 00:25:35,840
Don't you know I'm an awful liar?

348
00:25:35,913 --> 00:25:40,213
I'm illiterate, I don't know much, 
so I make things up.

349
00:25:40,284 --> 00:25:41,649
But I mean no harm.

350
00:25:46,390 --> 00:25:47,448
What's wrong?

351
00:25:47,525 --> 00:25:50,392
Having the same name as my father
and having a dick...

352
00:25:50,461 --> 00:25:52,361
as big as his gives me the creeps.

353
00:25:52,430 --> 00:25:54,421
What'll you do when you have a pussy?

354
00:25:54,498 --> 00:25:55,931
You're an idiot.

355
00:25:56,000 --> 00:25:57,934
What do you think I'll do?

356
00:25:58,002 --> 00:26:00,630
Work somewhere respectable,
like a real woman.

357
00:26:02,640 --> 00:26:04,835
I'd love to read the news on TV.

358
00:26:04,909 --> 00:26:06,809
You have to study for that.

359
00:26:06,877 --> 00:26:08,435
Then I'll study, I'm still young.

360
00:26:15,820 --> 00:26:18,584
I'll take either of you, I've just 
been paid.

361
00:26:18,656 --> 00:26:21,648
One of us has a surprise between 
her legs.

362
00:26:21,725 --> 00:26:22,953
I don't care.

363
00:26:23,027 --> 00:26:25,655
You go, I'm burned out.

364
00:26:25,729 --> 00:26:26,957
I'm going for a coffee.

365
00:26:28,432 --> 00:26:29,865
Take care, Marieta.

366
00:26:29,934 --> 00:26:32,732
And don't worry, it'll all work out.

367
00:26:36,240 --> 00:26:38,970
I wish every night was like this.

368
00:26:56,527 --> 00:27:00,224
Hello, this is a message
for Adolfo Carpanta Orozco.

369
00:27:00,297 --> 00:27:03,232
This is the Temp Agency.

370
00:27:03,300 --> 00:27:06,463
Come by on Monday morning,
there may be a job for you.

371
00:27:06,537 --> 00:27:07,799
Goodbye and thank you.

372
00:27:18,949 --> 00:27:20,974
I need the money for the opera tickets.

373
00:27:22,820 --> 00:27:25,948
What's the opera about?

374
00:27:27,892 --> 00:27:31,760
It begins with a queen who beheads 
her suitors...

375
00:27:31,829 --> 00:27:34,923
but there's a happy ending.

376
00:27:36,267 --> 00:27:37,928
That's odd.

377
00:27:38,002 --> 00:27:41,369
If she beheads people, how can it 
end happily?

378
00:27:41,438 --> 00:27:43,497
I need it tomorrow.

379
00:27:43,574 --> 00:27:46,407
Will you lend it to me?

380
00:27:46,477 --> 00:27:48,104
Of course I will.

381
00:27:50,614 --> 00:27:52,775
It's great, Tomas!

382
00:27:52,850 --> 00:27:54,750
Things are looking up!

383
00:28:16,240 --> 00:28:18,731
Putting up with this every day.

384
00:28:18,809 --> 00:28:20,902
They're all useless.

385
00:28:20,978 --> 00:28:22,775
That blonde over there...

386
00:28:22,846 --> 00:28:24,814
She needs a good fuck.

387
00:28:25,516 --> 00:28:27,245
Nobody needs a bad one.

388
00:28:27,318 --> 00:28:29,616
She's a real nasty bitch.

389
00:28:29,687 --> 00:28:32,053
Forget one form and she has you 
shitting bricks.

390
00:28:33,357 --> 00:28:35,382
- She can't be that bad.
- Oh, no?

391
00:28:35,459 --> 00:28:37,791
If you get her, you'll soon find out.

392
00:28:37,861 --> 00:28:38,759
Next.

393
00:28:38,829 --> 00:28:40,888
It's your lucky day.

394
00:28:40,965 --> 00:28:42,398
Sir!
Sir, I forgot!

395
00:28:42,466 --> 00:28:44,058
Get back in line, please.

396
00:28:44,134 --> 00:28:45,192
Next.

397
00:28:45,269 --> 00:28:46,395
You're screwed.

398
00:28:50,007 --> 00:28:51,065
Sit down.

399
00:28:51,141 --> 00:28:52,301
Not there.

400
00:28:52,376 --> 00:28:52,808
There.

401
00:28:56,046 --> 00:28:57,035
I.D. please.

402
00:29:01,819 --> 00:29:04,344
- I'm here for...
- The computer will tell me.

403
00:29:08,459 --> 00:29:09,949
Let's see.

404
00:29:10,027 --> 00:29:12,427
Cleaning service, night shift.

405
00:29:12,496 --> 00:29:15,226
Adolfo Carpanta Orozco.

406
00:29:24,308 --> 00:29:28,074
I'm sorry, 
as the database says "Adolfo"...

407
00:29:28,145 --> 00:29:33,048
they've assigned you a 
job for an Adolfo, that is, for a man.

408
00:29:33,117 --> 00:29:34,175
And?

409
00:29:34,251 --> 00:29:38,210
And... your name doesn't
correspond with your appearance.

410
00:29:38,289 --> 00:29:40,917
And would you be kind enough to 
offer it to me?

411
00:29:42,393 --> 00:29:46,261
Because, 
officially, miss, I'm still Adolfo.

412
00:29:51,602 --> 00:29:52,728
Just a moment.

413
00:30:22,900 --> 00:30:24,731
I'll check it out now.

414
00:30:54,898 --> 00:30:55,728
Adolfo?

415
00:30:57,301 --> 00:30:57,995
Adolfo?

416
00:30:59,203 --> 00:31:00,192
Adolfo!

417
00:31:01,105 --> 00:31:01,833
Adolfo!

418
00:31:03,907 --> 00:31:05,602
You'll have to wear a
uniform that corresponds...

419
00:31:05,676 --> 00:31:08,440
to the sex that appears on your I.D.

420
00:31:08,846 --> 00:31:14,682
~~ You want to change and you 
can do it. ~~

421
00:31:14,752 --> 00:31:18,381
~~ You're going to change. ~~

422
00:31:19,857 --> 00:31:22,451
DISAPPOINTMENT STREET

423
00:31:23,227 --> 00:31:26,321
~~ You can change. ~~

424
00:31:29,867 --> 00:31:33,325
~~ You want to. ~~

425
00:31:36,106 --> 00:31:38,267
Hold it without fear.

426
00:31:38,342 --> 00:31:42,005
Like you'd hold the body of
a woman you were making love to.

427
00:31:42,079 --> 00:31:44,604
Look, 
Tomas, music comes from sex.

428
00:31:44,681 --> 00:31:47,081
But harmony also comes from sex.

429
00:31:47,151 --> 00:31:50,279
That's right, don't be scared.

430
00:31:50,354 --> 00:31:52,151
Seduce it.

431
00:31:52,222 --> 00:31:55,191
- I can't reach.
- That doesn't matter.

432
00:31:55,259 --> 00:31:57,193
Seduce it.

433
00:31:57,261 --> 00:31:59,058
Dominate it.

434
00:31:59,129 --> 00:32:01,290
Make it obey you.

435
00:32:02,666 --> 00:32:03,997
Hello, Marieta.

436
00:32:04,067 --> 00:32:05,159
Good morning.

437
00:32:07,671 --> 00:32:08,569
Who is this?

438
00:32:08,639 --> 00:32:10,698
I'm Tomas's private teacher.

439
00:32:10,774 --> 00:32:12,071
For the cello.

440
00:32:12,142 --> 00:32:14,337
And who's paying the teacher?

441
00:32:14,411 --> 00:32:17,437
I get a weekly class in exchange for 
a season ticket to the opera.

442
00:32:17,514 --> 00:32:18,981
So I'm paying her, right?

443
00:32:19,683 --> 00:32:22,379
Is she annoyed by my pedagogy?

444
00:32:22,453 --> 00:32:24,785
Don't talk as if I weren't here!

445
00:32:24,855 --> 00:32:26,049
- Don't get angry.

446
00:32:26,123 --> 00:32:30,116
I'm angry because I'm saving to get 
rid of a spare bit of flesh...

447
00:32:30,194 --> 00:32:33,994
and I'm not willing to pay for this 
dwarf's fancy ideas!

448
00:32:34,064 --> 00:32:35,088
So there!

449
00:32:44,007 --> 00:32:46,498
The teacher has gone.

450
00:32:46,577 --> 00:32:49,068
Don't be angry.

451
00:32:49,146 --> 00:32:50,238
She says I've got talent.

452
00:32:51,648 --> 00:32:54,082
We've all got talent, Tomas.

453
00:32:54,151 --> 00:32:57,120
What we don't have is money to 
develop it.

454
00:32:57,187 --> 00:32:58,814
What's up?

455
00:32:58,889 --> 00:33:00,686
Are you a bit upset?

456
00:33:00,757 --> 00:33:02,520
I need a cuddle.

457
00:33:03,694 --> 00:33:04,888
Give me a hug.

458
00:33:12,169 --> 00:33:14,137
I can't be angry with you.

459
00:33:14,204 --> 00:33:16,764
You can do anything with me.

460
00:33:16,840 --> 00:33:19,968
What if you fall in love with that teacher?

461
00:33:20,043 --> 00:33:22,807
You like older women.

462
00:33:22,880 --> 00:33:24,973
I don't trust her.

463
00:33:25,048 --> 00:33:26,515
She wants something.

464
00:33:28,018 --> 00:33:29,178
Listen, Mari.

465
00:33:30,787 --> 00:33:32,379
Don't worry.

466
00:33:32,456 --> 00:33:34,822
Opera is getting really popular.

467
00:33:34,892 --> 00:33:36,985
We'll make a lot of money.

468
00:33:37,060 --> 00:33:40,461
I'll make sure you don't go short.

469
00:33:40,531 --> 00:33:44,831
Whatever extra we earn is for your 
operation.

470
00:33:48,672 --> 00:33:52,506
I love it when you talk like the man 
of the house.

471
00:33:52,576 --> 00:33:54,237
It cheers me up.

472
00:33:59,316 --> 00:34:02,945
You have to call the guard every 
half hour on the interphone,

473
00:34:03,020 --> 00:34:04,214
so you don't fall asleep.

474
00:34:05,088 --> 00:34:05,884
A joint?

475
00:34:07,457 --> 00:34:09,823
But they do a round in the middle 
of the night.

476
00:34:09,893 --> 00:34:11,258
Got it all clear?

477
00:34:13,330 --> 00:34:14,194
Take the mop.

478
00:34:16,333 --> 00:34:17,095
No, the other way round.

479
00:34:18,135 --> 00:34:19,363
Don't touch the floor.

480
00:34:19,436 --> 00:34:20,425
Turn it round.

481
00:34:21,805 --> 00:34:23,272
Come on, keep going.

482
00:34:23,340 --> 00:34:24,898
Not you, the mop.

483
00:34:24,975 --> 00:34:26,374
This is...

484
00:34:26,443 --> 00:34:29,105
Watch out,
it's new, very expensive.

485
00:34:29,179 --> 00:34:31,204
You haven't used wax or anything.

486
00:34:31,281 --> 00:34:32,305
That's good.

487
00:34:32,382 --> 00:34:34,441
Make sure all the corners are clean.

488
00:34:34,518 --> 00:34:36,008
That's it.

489
00:34:36,086 --> 00:34:37,986
That's good.

490
00:34:38,055 --> 00:34:39,818
A general clean.

491
00:34:42,259 --> 00:34:44,784
Clenched fists, nervous person.

492
00:34:44,861 --> 00:34:47,352
Take it easy, man.
This job will relax you.

493
00:34:59,509 --> 00:35:02,171
I split up from my wife, a month ago.

494
00:35:03,413 --> 00:35:04,437
I don't care.

495
00:35:07,918 --> 00:35:09,078
I'm devastated.

496
00:35:36,713 --> 00:35:39,443
Hello!
I'm the new cleaning guy.

497
00:35:39,516 --> 00:35:40,983
- I'm calling to...
- OK.

498
00:35:44,721 --> 00:35:45,483
All right.

499
00:35:50,427 --> 00:35:54,386
Mop, mop, mop, 
mop, mop, mop...

500
00:36:14,017 --> 00:36:15,143
Hello!

501
00:36:19,056 --> 00:36:20,421
It's tremendous.

502
00:36:22,059 --> 00:36:23,993
The immensity.

503
00:36:27,364 --> 00:36:29,059
Berta!

504
00:36:29,132 --> 00:36:30,565
What is it?

505
00:36:30,634 --> 00:36:33,660
- Shall I take Pauli to school?
- Yes, come up.

506
00:36:34,171 --> 00:36:35,604
I'll fix breakfast for you.

507
00:36:39,209 --> 00:36:40,938
Is the price negotiable?

508
00:36:41,011 --> 00:36:43,138
No haggling, I'm not Moroccan.

509
00:36:43,213 --> 00:36:45,340
Well, I'll think about it.

510
00:36:46,183 --> 00:36:48,413
All right.
This way.

511
00:36:49,252 --> 00:36:51,345
- So long.
- So long, love.

512
00:36:56,359 --> 00:36:58,554
Why are you selling the furniture?

513
00:36:58,628 --> 00:37:00,152
I have to.

514
00:37:01,331 --> 00:37:02,662
Why?

515
00:37:02,733 --> 00:37:05,600
The bastards in 
the bank are repossessing the place.

516
00:37:07,237 --> 00:37:10,035
You think what I earn dusting 
off rubber dicks pays for the house...

517
00:37:10,107 --> 00:37:11,972
and Pauli's school?

518
00:37:13,710 --> 00:37:16,338
Find another job that pays you 
more money.

519
00:37:18,048 --> 00:37:21,916
Look, given that I'm fat and I won't 
see 30 again,

520
00:37:21,985 --> 00:37:25,682
all I can do 
here is what the Ecuadorians do.

521
00:37:25,756 --> 00:37:28,554
Clean up other people's shit for 
a pittance.

522
00:37:28,625 --> 00:37:30,354
This country has gone to hell.

523
00:37:33,697 --> 00:37:36,097
I've got a bit of money saved,

524
00:37:36,166 --> 00:37:38,532
but it's for the operation on my pecker.

525
00:37:38,602 --> 00:37:40,433
Don't talk rubbish.

526
00:37:46,343 --> 00:37:47,742
Maria's taking you to school today.

527
00:37:51,782 --> 00:37:53,682
My hands are wet.

528
00:37:53,750 --> 00:37:56,014
Come here 
and I'll dry them for you, love.

529
00:37:56,086 --> 00:37:58,418
Now the other hand.

530
00:37:59,122 --> 00:38:00,919
What are you doing today, Pauli?

531
00:38:00,991 --> 00:38:02,652
Marieta...

532
00:38:02,726 --> 00:38:04,250
What?

533
00:38:04,327 --> 00:38:07,785
Before I go to school, would
you show me your penis?

534
00:38:09,800 --> 00:38:12,064
He's studying the reproductive organs.

535
00:38:12,135 --> 00:38:14,660
The other kids have their fathers 
at home.

536
00:38:14,738 --> 00:38:16,399
We thought you could help us.

537
00:38:16,473 --> 00:38:18,031
Berta...

538
00:38:18,108 --> 00:38:19,905
Don't be so old fashioned.

539
00:38:28,552 --> 00:38:31,214
Rebecca, where's your sister?

540
00:38:31,288 --> 00:38:33,051
She can't come, she's sick.

541
00:38:33,690 --> 00:38:35,282
They're not rotten, are they?

542
00:38:35,358 --> 00:38:38,088
Back home, we give the rotten ones 
to the pigs.

543
00:38:38,161 --> 00:38:39,321
What's wrong with her?

544
00:38:39,396 --> 00:38:40,829
They're perfect.

545
00:38:40,897 --> 00:38:43,297
Nothing, women's trouble.

546
00:38:45,902 --> 00:38:47,961
A kilo of cherries.

547
00:38:48,038 --> 00:38:49,096
Anything else, Nicolasa?

548
00:38:51,007 --> 00:38:55,000
- Weigh them for me again.
- Have I ever cheated you?

549
00:38:55,078 --> 00:38:56,409
I can't see very well.

550
00:38:56,479 --> 00:38:57,810
Go on, love.

551
00:38:57,881 --> 00:38:59,348
See what they weigh.

552
00:38:59,416 --> 00:39:00,041
A kilo, grandma.

553
00:39:01,585 --> 00:39:02,313
Put it on my slate.

554
00:39:04,287 --> 00:39:06,380
They always cheat us.

555
00:39:06,456 --> 00:39:09,050
Yeah, and then I have to give 
her credit.

556
00:39:10,026 --> 00:39:11,152
What do you want?

557
00:39:11,228 --> 00:39:12,957
Vegetables for a stew.

558
00:39:14,898 --> 00:39:16,763
She isn't sick.

559
00:39:16,833 --> 00:39:18,664
Know where she is?

560
00:39:18,735 --> 00:39:22,398
She left home, 
with a man who could be her father.

561
00:39:22,472 --> 00:39:23,769
What am I saying?

562
00:39:23,840 --> 00:39:26,604
He could be her grandfather!
He says he's a TV producer.

563
00:39:27,344 --> 00:39:29,676
- You don't say!
- She can go to hell.

564
00:39:29,746 --> 00:39:32,909
You spend your life cultivating 
the girl,

565
00:39:32,983 --> 00:39:37,750
fertilizing her, so that she'll be shiny 
and colorful some day.

566
00:39:37,821 --> 00:39:39,755
And the next thing you know...

567
00:39:49,432 --> 00:39:52,492
...she gets plucked by the first creep 
that passes.

568
00:39:52,836 --> 00:39:53,996
Adolfo.

569
00:39:54,571 --> 00:39:55,230
Adolfo.

570
00:39:55,672 --> 00:39:56,366
Adolfo.

571
00:39:59,676 --> 00:40:01,337
Too much!

572
00:40:01,411 --> 00:40:04,710
That's you he's carrying over his 
shoulder.

573
00:40:04,781 --> 00:40:08,080
That's you he's carrying like a burden.

574
00:40:13,123 --> 00:40:15,216
You have to get ahead in life.

575
00:40:15,292 --> 00:40:16,281
You what?

576
00:40:20,630 --> 00:40:23,190
You have to get ahead, suck dicks.

577
00:40:23,266 --> 00:40:25,461
What?
What was that, bitch?

578
00:40:27,170 --> 00:40:28,728
Enjoy yourself while you can.

579
00:40:29,539 --> 00:40:31,336
You're a miserable faggot...

580
00:40:31,408 --> 00:40:33,467
and a pathetic transvestite!

581
00:40:47,924 --> 00:40:53,726
~~ May infinity be left without its stars... ~~

582
00:40:53,797 --> 00:41:00,361
~~ or may the ocean lose its immensity... ~~

583
00:41:00,437 --> 00:41:05,966
~~ but may the darkness of
your eyes never fade... ~~

584
00:41:06,042 --> 00:41:12,277
~~ and may your honey-colored skin 
remain the same. ~~

585
00:41:13,383 --> 00:41:18,013
~~ If the rainbow were to lose its beauty... ~~

586
00:41:18,088 --> 00:41:22,923
~~ and the flowers their colors and 
perfume, ~~

587
00:41:22,993 --> 00:41:27,589
~~ I wouldn't feel as sad as I would... ~~

588
00:41:27,664 --> 00:41:33,500
~~ if I were to lose your love. ~~

589
00:41:35,105 --> 00:41:41,305
~~ I care about you, and you,
and you, and only you, ~~

590
00:41:41,378 --> 00:41:43,972
~~ and you, and you. ~~

591
00:41:44,047 --> 00:41:47,039
~~ I care about you, and you, and you, ~~

592
00:41:47,117 --> 00:41:50,450
~~ and no one else but you. ~~

593
00:41:51,488 --> 00:41:56,949
~~ It's crazy but it's true,
I only want to be with you. ~~

594
00:41:57,761 --> 00:42:05,031
~~ Dark eyes, honey-colored skin
that drive me to despair. ~~

595
00:42:05,101 --> 00:42:09,003
~~ I care about you, and you, and you, ~~

596
00:42:09,072 --> 00:42:13,372
~~ and no one else but you, and you, 
and you. ~~

597
00:42:13,443 --> 00:42:16,537
~~ I care about you, and you, and you, ~~

598
00:42:16,613 --> 00:42:18,945
~~ and no one else but you. ~~

599
00:42:20,784 --> 00:42:26,586
~~ It's crazy but it's true,
I only want to be with you. ~~

600
00:42:27,957 --> 00:42:33,987
~~ You stopped and smiled at me
and asked if I'd care to dance. ~~

601
00:42:34,064 --> 00:42:37,056
~~ I fell into your open arms, ~~

602
00:42:37,133 --> 00:42:39,601
~~ and I didn't have a chance. ~~

603
00:42:39,669 --> 00:42:41,034
~~ Now listen honey... ~~

604
00:42:41,104 --> 00:42:43,732
~~ I care about you, and you, and you, ~~

605
00:42:43,807 --> 00:42:47,174
~~ and no one else but you, and you, 
and you. ~~

606
00:42:47,243 --> 00:42:50,838
~~ I care about you, and you, and you, ~~

607
00:42:50,914 --> 00:42:53,815
~~ and no one else but you. ~~

608
00:42:55,852 --> 00:42:59,083
~~ There are people who like 
pasteurized milk. ~~

609
00:42:59,155 --> 00:43:02,750
~~ There are people who like 
condensed milk. ~~

610
00:43:02,826 --> 00:43:06,353
~~ There are people who like milk 
in their coffee. ~~

611
00:43:06,429 --> 00:43:09,921
~~ And you, who the hell are you 
trying to milk? ~~

612
00:43:10,333 --> 00:43:12,961
~~ I care about you, and you, 
and you, ~~

613
00:43:13,036 --> 00:43:16,437
~~ and no one else but you, and you, 
and you. ~~

614
00:43:16,506 --> 00:43:19,907
~~ I care about you, and you, 
and you, ~~

615
00:43:19,976 --> 00:43:22,968
~~ and no one else but you. ~~

616
00:43:23,646 --> 00:43:26,581
~~ and no one else but you. ~~

617
00:43:27,117 --> 00:43:31,281
~~ and no one else but you. ~~

618
00:44:00,550 --> 00:44:01,380
Cinderella!

619
00:44:02,352 --> 00:44:03,512
So you've woken up!

620
00:44:04,387 --> 00:44:05,718
What a wallop!

621
00:44:06,990 --> 00:44:09,049
Are you back with us again?

622
00:44:09,125 --> 00:44:10,615
Let's see how you are.

623
00:44:10,693 --> 00:44:12,251
Do you feel all right?

624
00:44:12,395 --> 00:44:13,692
You were fast asleep!

625
00:44:13,763 --> 00:44:16,664
You were snoring so much all the 
patients complained.

626
00:44:16,733 --> 00:44:18,132
It's true.

627
00:44:18,201 --> 00:44:19,691
Now, take it easy...

628
00:44:21,404 --> 00:44:23,463
That's it, move slowly.

629
00:44:23,540 --> 00:44:24,734
You're not dizzy?

630
00:44:25,708 --> 00:44:26,640
Good.

631
00:44:28,244 --> 00:44:29,506
Let's see.

632
00:44:29,579 --> 00:44:32,377
Don't worry, we explained everything 
to your husband.

633
00:44:35,585 --> 00:44:37,348
I had to tell a few lies.

634
00:44:37,420 --> 00:44:40,412
I said I was your boyfriend so they'd 
let me in.

635
00:44:40,490 --> 00:44:42,958
But that wasn't enough.

636
00:44:43,026 --> 00:44:45,722
So I said we were married.

637
00:44:45,795 --> 00:44:48,286
They looked at me and they let me in.

638
00:44:55,905 --> 00:44:56,929
A pigeon.

639
00:44:58,908 --> 00:45:01,206
You fainted when I arrived with the 
strawberries.

640
00:45:01,277 --> 00:45:03,802
You hit your head on a crate of 
red peppers.

641
00:45:05,882 --> 00:45:07,543
You were out for five hours.

642
00:45:07,617 --> 00:45:09,278
But I didn't waste the time.

643
00:45:12,855 --> 00:45:14,288
Here.

644
00:45:14,357 --> 00:45:15,517
Hold this.

645
00:45:15,592 --> 00:45:16,490
A great tune!

646
00:45:30,506 --> 00:45:31,905
Mariana, look!

647
00:45:31,975 --> 00:45:33,602
That is one beautiful man.

648
00:45:38,081 --> 00:45:39,241
Keep the helmet.

649
00:45:39,983 --> 00:45:41,075
A gift.

650
00:45:44,420 --> 00:45:45,648
Tell me where you work.

651
00:45:52,562 --> 00:45:53,460
In a house.

652
00:45:55,398 --> 00:45:56,524
With a circle.

653
00:45:56,599 --> 00:45:59,363
A clock.
A church!

654
00:45:59,435 --> 00:46:02,461
No, not a church.
Trains, a station!

655
00:46:02,538 --> 00:46:04,836
You work in a station?
Which one?

656
00:46:04,907 --> 00:46:07,068
Nose.
Sneeze!

657
00:46:07,143 --> 00:46:08,576
A-tishoo.
Atocha!

658
00:46:09,979 --> 00:46:11,310
I love that game.

659
00:46:11,381 --> 00:46:13,144
I'm good, I play it with my mother.

660
00:46:13,216 --> 00:46:15,047
...convinced he loves her.

661
00:46:15,118 --> 00:46:16,483
I doubt it.

662
00:46:16,552 --> 00:46:18,417
That bike is the best ride she's ever had.

663
00:46:18,488 --> 00:46:20,888
Can I see you there some day?

664
00:46:22,892 --> 00:46:24,757
You work during the day.

665
00:46:24,827 --> 00:46:27,421
You work at night, in the station.

666
00:46:29,499 --> 00:46:31,057
Cleaning windows...

667
00:46:31,134 --> 00:46:32,829
and the floor.

668
00:46:32,902 --> 00:46:35,302
You work in Atocha all night
cleaning the whole station.

669
00:46:36,172 --> 00:46:37,935
But she's so ugly.

670
00:46:38,007 --> 00:46:40,373
And the guy is so cute.

671
00:46:40,443 --> 00:46:42,240
I'll drop by some night.

672
00:46:56,659 --> 00:46:58,320
- Don't look at her.
- I bet she's happy.

673
00:46:58,394 --> 00:47:00,123
Act like we haven't seen.

674
00:47:00,196 --> 00:47:01,458
Good afternoon.

675
00:47:29,425 --> 00:47:31,985
~~ Green, how I want you green. ~~

676
00:47:32,061 --> 00:47:34,529
~~ Green wind. Green branches. ~~

677
00:47:34,597 --> 00:47:36,895
~~ The ship out on the sea... ~~

678
00:47:36,966 --> 00:47:41,699
~~ and the horse on the mountain.
Green, how I want you green. ~~

679
00:47:47,777 --> 00:47:52,714
~~ With the shade upon her waist,
she dreams on her balcony. ~~

680
00:47:52,782 --> 00:47:55,342
~~ Green flesh, her hair green... ~~

681
00:47:55,418 --> 00:47:59,752
~~ with eyes of cold silver.
Green, how I want you green. ~~

682
00:48:00,790 --> 00:48:03,054
~~ Green, how I want you green. ~~

683
00:48:03,459 --> 00:48:05,222
~~ Green, how I want you green. ~~

684
00:48:08,097 --> 00:48:09,325
A fruit stocker.

685
00:48:09,399 --> 00:48:11,629
His name's Raul, like my cousin 
who jerked off...

686
00:48:11,701 --> 00:48:13,293
with me in grandma's shed.

687
00:48:13,369 --> 00:48:15,098
That's a sign.

688
00:48:15,171 --> 00:48:16,934
Let the man do his thing.

689
00:48:17,006 --> 00:48:19,497
Officially speaking, we're both men.

690
00:48:19,575 --> 00:48:22,669
Listen to me,
this knows what's what.

691
00:48:23,613 --> 00:48:25,342
Look, he's an innocent soul.

692
00:48:25,415 --> 00:48:26,712
He's very naive.

693
00:48:26,783 --> 00:48:29,513
And he gave me his motorbike 
helmet.

694
00:48:31,087 --> 00:48:33,248
And he's a musician.

695
00:48:33,322 --> 00:48:35,449
That means sensitivity.

696
00:48:35,525 --> 00:48:37,390
You know what?
It won't go anywhere.

697
00:48:37,460 --> 00:48:40,122
After the first date, men always get 
scared.

698
00:48:40,196 --> 00:48:41,720
Isn't that so?
Give me five!

699
00:48:41,798 --> 00:48:42,992
That's it!

700
00:48:45,601 --> 00:48:47,432
Maybe I imagined it all.

701
00:48:47,503 --> 00:48:49,403
I've got a lot of imagination, Gustavo.

702
00:48:49,472 --> 00:48:52,464
And I can see love under every stone.

703
00:48:52,542 --> 00:48:55,375
Look, if a man runs you home on 
his bike,

704
00:48:55,445 --> 00:48:57,106
he wants something.

705
00:48:57,180 --> 00:48:59,978
If he races his engine at you he wants 
to marry you.

706
00:49:02,418 --> 00:49:04,386
Now I'll be seeing myself dressed 
in white!

707
00:49:04,454 --> 00:49:05,443
Idiot!

708
00:49:31,147 --> 00:49:33,047
Hello, is Berta here?

709
00:49:33,115 --> 00:49:34,343
What Berta?

710
00:49:34,417 --> 00:49:36,248
A woman, kind of fat...

711
00:49:36,319 --> 00:49:38,344
- She owe you money?
- No.

712
00:49:38,421 --> 00:49:40,286
She left two or three weeks ago.

713
00:49:40,356 --> 00:49:44,258
She took money from the Hill and 
articles.

714
00:49:44,327 --> 00:49:45,851
Vibrators.

715
00:49:45,928 --> 00:49:47,190
Gosh!

716
00:49:47,263 --> 00:49:49,231
I haven't seen her either.

717
00:49:49,298 --> 00:49:51,592
People in Spain are very lazy and they 
steal a lot.

718
00:50:11,888 --> 00:50:16,222
Oh, fruit stocker, 
with an ass like a peach,

719
00:50:16,292 --> 00:50:18,260
come and see me, please.

720
00:50:25,067 --> 00:50:28,730
~~ High school girl, high school girl, ~~

721
00:50:28,804 --> 00:50:30,863
~~ I've fallen in love with the teacher. ~~

722
00:50:30,940 --> 00:50:32,567
~~ I can't help it. ~~

723
00:50:32,642 --> 00:50:34,701
~~ High school girl, high school girl. ~~

724
00:51:20,056 --> 00:51:22,115
Believe me, I'm in no mood for 
concerts.

725
00:51:26,295 --> 00:51:27,660
The pupil isn't in.

726
00:51:31,567 --> 00:51:35,333
Caress it as if it were a woman.

727
00:51:35,404 --> 00:51:37,395
But I like men.

728
00:51:37,473 --> 00:51:40,408
But don't you realize that the cello
is a man...

729
00:51:40,476 --> 00:51:42,444
with a woman's body?

730
00:51:42,511 --> 00:51:48,074
So place your head properly,
bring it close to your ear...

731
00:51:48,150 --> 00:51:50,141
and speak to it.

732
00:51:50,219 --> 00:51:53,814
And now imagine that the bow is 
your sex...

733
00:51:53,889 --> 00:51:56,687
and it's caressing his skin.

734
00:51:56,759 --> 00:51:58,989
Gently.

735
00:51:59,061 --> 00:52:01,256
Your head.

736
00:52:01,330 --> 00:52:02,422
Keep it like that.

737
00:52:03,699 --> 00:52:04,666
That's it.

738
00:52:11,407 --> 00:52:12,635
What is it?

739
00:52:17,780 --> 00:52:19,077
I look elegant.

740
00:52:32,128 --> 00:52:34,255
I'm no good at scalping.

741
00:52:34,330 --> 00:52:36,662
People don't trust me because 
I'm a dwarf.

742
00:52:36,732 --> 00:52:41,226
But we've spent a fortune buying 
boxes at the opera.

743
00:52:41,303 --> 00:52:43,897
You said you'd pay me back with interest.

744
00:52:45,207 --> 00:52:47,300
- I don't know.
- What don't you know?

745
00:52:47,376 --> 00:52:50,311
Tell me what we're going to do with 
all those tickets.

746
00:52:50,379 --> 00:52:50,970
I can't.

747
00:52:54,517 --> 00:52:56,883
Do it for me, for your Mari.

748
00:52:56,952 --> 00:52:59,443
She needs the money to get rid of 
her peenie.

749
00:53:00,656 --> 00:53:01,418
All right.

750
00:53:02,158 --> 00:53:02,988
What did you say?

751
00:53:03,059 --> 00:53:03,991
All right.

752
00:53:04,060 --> 00:53:05,823
My dwarf is a giant!

753
00:53:06,896 --> 00:53:08,090
Let me rinse your hair.

754
00:53:14,003 --> 00:53:16,528
Was the teacher angry I missed 
the class?

755
00:53:16,605 --> 00:53:19,267
The teacher?
You creep, I was angry.

756
00:53:19,341 --> 00:53:21,400
Where were you all night?

757
00:53:21,477 --> 00:53:23,240
- Around.
- No, not "around".

758
00:53:23,312 --> 00:53:24,472
Where?

759
00:53:26,615 --> 00:53:27,547
Where?

760
00:53:29,985 --> 00:53:31,680
Come with me to the nurse.

761
00:53:36,892 --> 00:53:38,154
Paquita?

762
00:53:38,227 --> 00:53:42,391
Some friends called me and I can't 
go now.

763
00:53:42,965 --> 00:53:45,525
I'm giving some injections to the 
transvestites.

764
00:53:45,601 --> 00:53:47,159
They're a real pain.

765
00:53:47,236 --> 00:53:48,498
They're wearing me out.

766
00:53:49,638 --> 00:53:53,301
Maybe one day I'll finish up and I 
can go with you.

767
00:53:53,375 --> 00:53:57,368
We'll go to Benidorm and have a 
great time on the beach.

768
00:53:59,181 --> 00:54:02,844
We'll get drunk and stuff ourselves.

769
00:54:03,986 --> 00:54:05,078
I miss you.

770
00:54:05,154 --> 00:54:05,916
Lots of love.

771
00:54:14,864 --> 00:54:16,331
What a racket!

772
00:54:18,901 --> 00:54:21,267
Hello, love.

773
00:54:24,173 --> 00:54:26,107
Where's she going?

774
00:54:26,909 --> 00:54:29,673
- Pili, who's first?
- You are.

775
00:54:29,745 --> 00:54:30,734
That's it!

776
00:54:30,813 --> 00:54:32,713
Shut up, my lovelies.

777
00:54:32,782 --> 00:54:34,010
Go suck!

778
00:54:36,519 --> 00:54:37,884
Be careful, Pili.

779
00:54:37,953 --> 00:54:40,114
The police'll come one day and close 
your business.

780
00:54:40,189 --> 00:54:43,317
All those evil transvestites.

781
00:54:43,392 --> 00:54:44,723
Take off your panties!

782
00:54:44,794 --> 00:54:45,761
Hello, Viuelo.

783
00:54:46,595 --> 00:54:49,086
Give me two today, I'm looking 
very macho.

784
00:54:49,165 --> 00:54:50,928
Too many hormones are bad for you.

785
00:54:55,604 --> 00:54:59,404
Pili, I love that photo of you with 
Ava Gardner.

786
00:54:59,475 --> 00:55:00,908
That was in the Chicote.

787
00:55:02,344 --> 00:55:03,811
Was she really elegant?

788
00:55:03,879 --> 00:55:06,507
No!
She was a randy bitch!

789
00:55:07,950 --> 00:55:09,144
A randy bitch!

790
00:55:14,190 --> 00:55:15,487
Here we go.

791
00:55:15,558 --> 00:55:17,185
I hate needles.

792
00:55:20,396 --> 00:55:22,796
Tomas, give me your hand.
I feel dizzy.

793
00:55:22,865 --> 00:55:24,264
You're such a coward.

794
00:55:26,402 --> 00:55:27,369
I can't find the spot.

795
00:55:27,436 --> 00:55:29,870
Find it, Pili.
Find it!

796
00:55:36,912 --> 00:55:40,871
~~ Put on the mask, the mask. ~~

797
00:55:43,352 --> 00:55:45,946
~~ Put on the mask, the mask. ~~

798
00:55:46,021 --> 00:55:48,785
~~ Because everyone is in disguise. ~~

799
00:55:48,858 --> 00:55:52,885
~~ Everything is fantastic, fantastic. ~~

800
00:55:55,431 --> 00:55:58,400
~~ Put on the mask, your mask. ~~

801
00:55:58,467 --> 00:56:00,833
~~ And it'll be your talisman. ~~

802
00:56:00,903 --> 00:56:11,302
~~ I'm asking you to love me and
to tell me nothing but the truth. ~~

803
00:56:11,380 --> 00:56:16,875
~~ But later, in life... ~~

804
00:56:16,952 --> 00:56:22,117
~~ don't see or hear or speak. ~~

805
00:56:22,191 --> 00:56:23,681
~~ And put on, put on, put on, put on, ~~

806
00:56:23,759 --> 00:56:28,560
~~ put on the mask so carefully. ~~

807
00:56:28,631 --> 00:56:35,059
~~ Put on the mask, the mask,
and you can be happy. ~~

808
00:56:35,137 --> 00:56:40,404
~~ Because everyone is in disguise
and all the year is carnival. ~~

809
00:56:40,476 --> 00:56:49,316
~~ Don't go out on the street without 
your mask, mask, mask... ~~

810
00:56:49,385 --> 00:56:56,882
~~ mask, mask, mask, mask, mask, 
mask... ~~

811
00:57:09,672 --> 00:57:11,264
Is she dead?

812
00:57:11,340 --> 00:57:13,433
No way, she's snoring.

813
00:57:27,389 --> 00:57:29,516
One tries to be decent.

814
00:57:29,591 --> 00:57:33,891
But you, 
Lord, aren't doing very much to help.

815
00:57:33,963 --> 00:57:38,423
Your father made a hell of mistake
giving me those extra 20 centimeters.

816
00:57:39,635 --> 00:57:44,197
Some guys would really brag if
they had that kind of...

817
00:57:44,273 --> 00:57:45,740
pecker.

818
00:57:49,778 --> 00:57:52,178
The word "pecker" makes me laugh.

819
00:57:52,247 --> 00:57:53,874
Miss, excuse me.

820
00:57:53,949 --> 00:57:56,110
Sorry, I'm talking out loud.

821
00:57:56,185 --> 00:57:58,153
No, it isn't that.

822
00:57:58,220 --> 00:57:59,915
The church stinks of fish.

823
00:57:59,989 --> 00:58:01,854
When people come in...

824
00:58:01,924 --> 00:58:03,619
It's a very big hake.

825
00:58:10,733 --> 00:58:11,597
So long.

826
00:58:17,806 --> 00:58:19,501
You're early.

827
00:58:19,575 --> 00:58:21,202
The kid isn't in bed yet.

828
00:58:22,678 --> 00:58:25,374
It's the time we arranged; 12:30.

829
00:58:25,447 --> 00:58:27,074
Come up.

830
00:58:31,854 --> 00:58:32,752
Berta?

831
00:58:33,422 --> 00:58:34,252
Yes?

832
00:58:34,323 --> 00:58:36,188
I knew you 
were mixed up in something bad.

833
00:58:36,258 --> 00:58:39,659
Send Pauli down to Tomas so he 
doesn't see anything.

834
00:58:39,728 --> 00:58:41,218
Berta, please!

835
00:58:41,296 --> 00:58:43,093
I can't talk now.

836
00:58:43,165 --> 00:58:44,598
I'll tell you tomorrow.

837
00:58:51,473 --> 00:58:52,269
Hey!

838
00:58:52,674 --> 00:58:53,732
Hey!

839
00:58:53,809 --> 00:58:57,301
You have to walk up, the elevator 
is broken!

840
00:59:43,525 --> 00:59:44,787
What do you want, love?

841
00:59:44,860 --> 00:59:46,452
You got a cock?

842
00:59:46,528 --> 00:59:49,463
I asked first, "bakaleti".

843
00:59:49,531 --> 00:59:53,558
I want you to suck me off and my pal 
wants it up the ass.

844
00:59:55,504 --> 00:59:58,132
Porky likes it Greek-style, does he?

845
00:59:59,041 --> 01:00:00,338
For sure!

846
01:00:00,409 --> 01:00:01,842
So, is there a cock?

847
01:00:03,011 --> 01:00:04,876
You want the magic words?

848
01:00:11,687 --> 01:00:13,985
20 centimeters!

849
01:00:14,056 --> 01:00:15,080
Cock!

850
01:00:15,157 --> 01:00:16,749
No condom!

851
01:00:16,825 --> 01:00:19,487
What do you think this is, the jungle?

852
01:00:19,561 --> 01:00:22,894
Then you go back to your
wives with some lousy disease.

853
01:00:22,965 --> 01:00:25,297
That's inconsiderate.

854
01:00:26,535 --> 01:00:28,435
Don't wank off, little guy.

855
01:00:28,504 --> 01:00:30,768
You're only allowed to come once.

856
01:00:32,374 --> 01:00:33,773
Quit jerking off!

857
01:00:33,842 --> 01:00:35,707
You'll come so fast, it's a waste 
of money.

858
01:00:36,945 --> 01:00:39,072
- Right.
- Take your time.

859
01:00:39,148 --> 01:00:40,706
I'm coming.

860
01:00:40,782 --> 01:00:42,249
Think of something else.

861
01:00:42,317 --> 01:00:43,341
No.

862
01:00:43,418 --> 01:00:45,648
Think of something else.
Think of your mother.

863
01:00:45,721 --> 01:00:47,586
- Yes!
- Think of your mother.

864
01:00:47,656 --> 01:00:49,123
My mother...
I'm coming!

865
01:00:49,191 --> 01:00:50,249
Someone's out there.

866
01:00:51,994 --> 01:00:53,962
The police!

867
01:00:54,029 --> 01:00:56,020
Like hell, they're whores.

868
01:01:10,445 --> 01:01:11,776
I want to be a saint.

869
01:01:39,474 --> 01:01:46,471
~~ I want to be canonized, whipped 
and flagellated. ~~

870
01:01:46,548 --> 01:01:50,075
~~ I want to levitate in the mornings... ~~

871
01:01:50,152 --> 01:01:53,781
~~ and have my body covered in sores. ~~

872
01:01:53,855 --> 01:02:00,818
~~ I want to be distressed, have
hallucinations and ecstasies. ~~

873
01:02:00,896 --> 01:02:08,325
~~ I want stigmata on my hands,
on my feet and in my side. ~~

874
01:02:08,403 --> 01:02:11,201
~~ I want to be a saint. ~~

875
01:02:11,807 --> 01:02:14,674
~~ I want to be blessed. ~~

876
01:02:15,410 --> 01:02:18,345
~~ I want to be a saint. ~~

877
01:02:18,981 --> 01:02:21,814
~~ I want to be blessed. ~~

878
01:02:31,727 --> 01:02:38,633
~~ I want to be martyred and to live 
cloistered. ~~

879
01:02:38,700 --> 01:02:45,663
~~ I want to be sanctified, to travel to 
Rome and see the Pope. ~~

880
01:02:45,741 --> 01:02:53,045
~~ I want that when I die my body 
stays incorrupt. ~~

881
01:02:53,115 --> 01:03:00,419
~~ I want everyone who sees me
to drop dead from fright. ~~

882
01:03:00,489 --> 01:03:03,322
~~ I want to be a saint. ~~

883
01:03:04,359 --> 01:03:06,759
~~ I want to be blessed. ~~

884
01:03:07,496 --> 01:03:10,329
~~ I want to be a saint. ~~

885
01:03:11,133 --> 01:03:14,625
~~ I want to be blessed. ~~

886
01:04:00,215 --> 01:04:01,512
What, Miguel?

887
01:04:02,984 --> 01:04:04,178
Fuck, man, no.

888
01:04:05,387 --> 01:04:07,446
There's only one room free.

889
01:04:17,666 --> 01:04:21,329
Marieta, 
darling, someone's looking for you.

890
01:04:21,403 --> 01:04:22,427
Who?

891
01:04:22,504 --> 01:04:24,802
I don't know.
"Coppercaillie" told me.

892
01:04:24,873 --> 01:04:27,899
It's Capercaillie, you dumb shit!

893
01:04:27,976 --> 01:04:28,806
Shut it!

894
01:04:30,445 --> 01:04:32,640
I'm going home.
Some other day!

895
01:04:37,652 --> 01:04:38,175
Marieta.

896
01:04:39,888 --> 01:04:41,321
Oh, Raul.

897
01:04:42,758 --> 01:04:43,690
Hello.

898
01:04:44,092 --> 01:04:45,024
What's up?

899
01:04:45,961 --> 01:04:47,428
Not a lot.

900
01:04:48,830 --> 01:04:50,957
- You're a liar.
- Why?

901
01:04:51,032 --> 01:04:53,364
You said you worked at Atocha 
and it's a lie.

902
01:04:53,435 --> 01:04:56,131
- You went there?
- Yesterday.

903
01:04:57,339 --> 01:04:59,204
I left, they didn't treat me well.

904
01:04:59,274 --> 01:05:01,970
Nobody there knew any Marieta.

905
01:05:03,912 --> 01:05:08,076
- They know me by my real name.
- What's that?

906
01:05:08,150 --> 01:05:10,015
- Ava.
- Ava?

907
01:05:11,853 --> 01:05:15,289
Like Ava Gardner, the actress.

908
01:05:15,357 --> 01:05:16,619
And Marieta?

909
01:05:16,691 --> 01:05:17,953
My stage name.

910
01:05:27,436 --> 01:05:30,667
After Atocha, I went to the door 
where I dropped you off.

911
01:05:30,739 --> 01:05:32,730
I asked on all the entry phones.

912
01:05:34,042 --> 01:05:36,636
They know you by your stage name.

913
01:05:36,711 --> 01:05:39,976
They mentioned a few places 
here and there.

914
01:05:40,048 --> 01:05:43,381
I drove around for a few nights 
until I found you.

915
01:05:47,322 --> 01:05:48,949
You did that for me?

916
01:05:49,958 --> 01:05:50,982
Yes.

917
01:05:52,427 --> 01:05:54,361
- Get that!
- What?

918
01:05:56,264 --> 01:05:59,131
- How intrepid.
- That's how I am.

919
01:06:07,008 --> 01:06:09,875
- Are you tired?
- A bit.

920
01:06:09,945 --> 01:06:12,106
Get on, I want to show you a place.

921
01:06:12,180 --> 01:06:14,740
- No, I'm going home.
- Get on.

922
01:06:14,816 --> 01:06:15,874
All right.

923
01:06:17,319 --> 01:06:19,651
Hey, sweetheart, this isn't your patch.

924
01:06:28,864 --> 01:06:29,990
What a pity.

925
01:06:39,007 --> 01:06:42,841
~~ True love, oh baby. True love, 
oh baby. ~~

926
01:06:42,911 --> 01:06:46,369
~~ True love, oh baby. True love. ~~

927
01:06:46,448 --> 01:06:48,916
~~ True love, baby. ~~

928
01:06:48,984 --> 01:06:54,388
~~ True love, oh baby.
True love, oh baby. True love. ~~

929
01:06:54,456 --> 01:06:56,924
~~ True love, baby. ~~

930
01:06:56,992 --> 01:07:02,487
~~ True love, oh baby.
True love, oh baby. True love. ~~

931
01:07:03,498 --> 01:07:10,734
~~ I've had other guys.
I've looked into their eyes. ~~

932
01:07:10,805 --> 01:07:18,610
~~ But I never knew love before
'til you walked through my door. ~~

933
01:07:18,680 --> 01:07:27,179
~~ I've had other lips.
I've sailed a thousand ships. ~~

934
01:07:27,255 --> 01:07:32,318
~~ But no matter where I go, you're the 
one for me, baby. ~~

935
01:07:32,394 --> 01:07:37,297
~~ This I know, 'cause it's true love. ~~

936
01:07:37,365 --> 01:07:41,301
~~ You're the one I'm dreaming of. ~~

937
01:07:41,369 --> 01:07:45,396
~~ Your heart fits me like a glove. ~~

938
01:07:45,473 --> 01:07:50,206
~~ And I'm gonna be true blue, baby, 
I love you. ~~

939
01:07:51,379 --> 01:07:58,842
~~ I've heard all the lines.
I've cried oh so many times. ~~

940
01:07:58,920 --> 01:08:02,822
~~ Those tear drops, they won't 
fall again. ~~

941
01:08:02,891 --> 01:08:06,554
~~ I'm so excited, you're my best friend. ~~

942
01:08:06,628 --> 01:08:14,899
~~ So if you should ever doubt,
wonder what love is all about. ~~

943
01:08:14,970 --> 01:08:18,872
~~ Just think back and remember, 
dear. ~~

944
01:08:18,940 --> 01:08:21,966
~~ Those words whispered in your ear. ~~

945
01:08:22,043 --> 01:08:25,308
~~ I said; true love. ~~

946
01:08:25,380 --> 01:08:29,214
~~ You're the one I'm dreaming of. ~~

947
01:08:29,284 --> 01:08:33,277
~~ Your heart fits me like a glove. ~~

948
01:08:33,355 --> 01:08:38,088
~~ I'm gonna be true blue, baby.
I love you. ~~

949
01:08:38,994 --> 01:08:42,794
~~ And now I know it's true love. ~~

950
01:08:42,864 --> 01:08:46,823
~~ You're the one I'm dreaming of. ~~

951
01:08:46,901 --> 01:08:50,769
~~ Your heart fits just like a glove. ~~

952
01:08:50,839 --> 01:08:54,434
~~ True blue, baby. I love you. ~~

953
01:08:55,076 --> 01:08:58,944
~~ No more sadness, I kiss it good-bye. ~~

954
01:08:59,014 --> 01:09:03,110
~~ The sun is bursting right out 
of the sky. ~~

955
01:09:03,184 --> 01:09:08,315
~~ I searched the whole world for 
someone like you. ~~

956
01:09:08,390 --> 01:09:12,986
~~ Don't you know, don't you know
that it's true love, oh baby. ~~

957
01:09:13,061 --> 01:09:19,125
~~ True love, oh baby.
True love, oh baby. True love. ~~

958
01:09:19,200 --> 01:09:23,068
~~ It's True love, oh baby.
True love, oh baby. ~~

959
01:09:23,138 --> 01:09:27,370
~~ True love, oh baby. True love. 
It's true. ~~

960
01:09:27,442 --> 01:09:34,974
~~ So if you should ever doubt.
Wonder what love is all about. ~~

961
01:09:35,050 --> 01:09:38,918
~~ Just think back and remember dear. ~~

962
01:09:38,987 --> 01:09:42,218
~~ Those words whispered in your ear. ~~

963
01:09:42,290 --> 01:09:47,159
~~ I said; No more sadness.
I kiss it good-bye. ~~

964
01:09:47,228 --> 01:09:51,130
~~ The sun is bursting right out 
of the sky. ~~

965
01:09:51,199 --> 01:09:56,159
~~ I searched the whole world
for someone like you. ~~

966
01:09:56,237 --> 01:10:01,334
~~ Don't you know, don't you
know that it's True love. ~~

967
01:10:01,409 --> 01:10:05,470
~~ You're the one I'm dreaming of. ~~

968
01:10:05,547 --> 01:10:09,483
~~ Your heart fits me like a glove. ~~

969
01:10:09,551 --> 01:10:14,284
~~ I'm gonna be true blue, baby.
I love you. ~~

970
01:10:15,256 --> 01:10:17,724
~~ True love. ~~

971
01:10:17,792 --> 01:10:21,523
~~ You're the one I'm dreaming of. ~~

972
01:10:21,596 --> 01:10:25,555
~~ Your heart fits me like a glove. ~~

973
01:10:25,633 --> 01:10:30,468
~~ I'm gonna be true blue, baby.
I love you. ~~

974
01:10:31,306 --> 01:10:33,467
~~ True love. ~~

975
01:10:33,541 --> 01:10:37,602
~~ You're the one I'm dreaming of. ~~

976
01:10:37,679 --> 01:10:41,615
~~ Your heart fits me like a glove. ~~

977
01:10:41,683 --> 01:10:46,586
~~ I'm gonna be true blue, baby.
I love you. ~~

978
01:10:54,829 --> 01:10:57,730
I dreamed it all.

979
01:11:05,507 --> 01:11:06,735
Good morning.

980
01:11:15,250 --> 01:11:17,445
You fell asleep, I brought you home.

981
01:11:18,486 --> 01:11:19,680
I don't understand you.

982
01:11:21,189 --> 01:11:22,679
Come here.

983
01:11:22,757 --> 01:11:24,190
Wait a minute.

984
01:11:24,259 --> 01:11:25,351
Come here.

985
01:11:25,426 --> 01:11:27,121
Get off.

986
01:11:34,869 --> 01:11:36,200
Go on.

987
01:11:39,240 --> 01:11:40,730
Go on.

988
01:11:44,979 --> 01:11:45,570
Do it now.

989
01:11:52,520 --> 01:11:53,509
What a dick!

990
01:11:54,022 --> 01:11:54,716
What a dick!

991
01:11:55,557 --> 01:11:58,583
- You like my cock!
- A lot, a lot.

992
01:12:00,495 --> 01:12:02,793
Stay there.
Stay down there.

993
01:12:09,704 --> 01:12:10,830
Let me get close!

994
01:12:10,905 --> 01:12:13,271
No, that's good, that's good.

995
01:12:13,341 --> 01:12:15,571
Stay up there.

996
01:12:15,643 --> 01:12:17,804
Give it to me harder!

997
01:12:37,565 --> 01:12:38,930
I had to sleep on the couch.

998
01:12:41,803 --> 01:12:43,828
Don't make noise when you chew.

999
01:12:46,040 --> 01:12:48,270
You promised not to bring clients here.

1000
01:12:48,343 --> 01:12:51,039
The home has to be respected.
That's what we said.

1001
01:12:52,247 --> 01:12:54,340
But he isn't a customer.

1002
01:12:54,415 --> 01:12:55,439
He's a...

1003
01:12:57,619 --> 01:12:59,553
special friend.

1004
01:13:00,154 --> 01:13:01,849
How long have you known this 
special friend?

1005
01:13:01,923 --> 01:13:04,084
We got to know each other bit by bit.

1006
01:13:04,158 --> 01:13:06,422
He's been a real gentleman.

1007
01:13:06,494 --> 01:13:08,689
He came to pick me up from work 
a few times.

1008
01:13:09,430 --> 01:13:11,125
What does that mean?

1009
01:13:11,199 --> 01:13:12,598
You'd better behave yourself.

1010
01:13:15,503 --> 01:13:17,528
I guess your roommate could lend 
me some shorts.

1011
01:13:18,873 --> 01:13:20,363
Raul, this is Tomas.

1012
01:13:22,176 --> 01:13:23,768
That's my towel.

1013
01:13:23,845 --> 01:13:24,869
Sorry.

1014
01:13:24,946 --> 01:13:27,540
There's a Chinese robe behind the door.

1015
01:13:27,615 --> 01:13:28,809
It's mine.

1016
01:13:32,687 --> 01:13:33,984
He's good looking.

1017
01:13:34,055 --> 01:13:34,680
Yeah.

1018
01:13:36,357 --> 01:13:38,291
And his dick is as big as yours.

1019
01:13:48,169 --> 01:13:51,605
- Hey, don't make noise.
- I eat really badly.

1020
01:13:54,709 --> 01:13:56,233
Raul is a stocker.

1021
01:13:57,211 --> 01:13:59,042
- On the Exchange?
- Hmm?

1022
01:13:59,681 --> 01:14:02,912
No, he's a stocker in the market.

1023
01:14:02,984 --> 01:14:05,544
- Fruit and vegetables.
- Right.

1024
01:14:05,620 --> 01:14:07,178
Right.

1025
01:14:07,255 --> 01:14:09,985
Tell him what you do, Tomas.

1026
01:14:10,058 --> 01:14:11,992
I'm in public relations.

1027
01:14:12,060 --> 01:14:14,722
Don't talk rubbish, you lying dwarf.

1028
01:14:14,796 --> 01:14:18,061
He wheels and deals,
he's a good businessman.

1029
01:14:18,132 --> 01:14:19,963
Scalping pays really well.

1030
01:14:20,034 --> 01:14:22,502
- Explain it, Tomas.
- No.

1031
01:14:22,570 --> 01:14:23,969
Why not?

1032
01:14:24,038 --> 01:14:26,233
I don't trust him, it's my idea.

1033
01:14:26,307 --> 01:14:28,104
But the money is mine, so tell him.

1034
01:14:31,579 --> 01:14:32,603
I don't believe this.

1035
01:14:33,214 --> 01:14:34,806
I'll get it, otherwise I'll hit you.

1036
01:14:35,950 --> 01:14:37,076
It's probably the teacher.

1037
01:14:40,154 --> 01:14:43,590
- Berta. Not now.
- Love...

1038
01:14:43,658 --> 01:14:44,989
Come up for a coffee.

1039
01:14:45,059 --> 01:14:47,425
I can't, I'm having breakfast.

1040
01:14:47,495 --> 01:14:48,894
And I'm not alone.

1041
01:14:53,334 --> 01:14:55,427
It's important, almost life or death.

1042
01:14:56,537 --> 01:14:57,595
Well, almost.

1043
01:14:59,774 --> 01:15:01,765
I need you to look after Paulito 
for a week.

1044
01:15:01,843 --> 01:15:04,277
I knew you were mixed up in 
something shady.

1045
01:15:04,345 --> 01:15:05,642
But you should go away.

1046
01:15:05,713 --> 01:15:07,943
If anything goes wrong, they'll come 
here first.

1047
01:15:08,016 --> 01:15:09,881
What the fuck is this?

1048
01:15:09,951 --> 01:15:12,886
It's best if you don't know,
for your own good.

1049
01:15:16,524 --> 01:15:19,584
You can't become a criminal overnight.

1050
01:15:19,660 --> 01:15:23,118
You have to think this over,
for Paulito's sake.

1051
01:15:23,197 --> 01:15:26,792
Look, if it works out,
there'll be no more scraping by.

1052
01:15:26,868 --> 01:15:27,994
That isn't living.

1053
01:15:34,442 --> 01:15:35,773
You're so right.

1054
01:15:38,479 --> 01:15:41,744
In any case, I can't look after him.

1055
01:15:41,816 --> 01:15:43,511
I'm due to have an operation.

1056
01:15:45,253 --> 01:15:47,278
And I'm starting a relationship.

1057
01:15:47,355 --> 01:15:50,449
Maria, in a week's time, Paulito,

1058
01:15:50,525 --> 01:15:52,288
you and I are going to Brazil.

1059
01:15:52,360 --> 01:15:54,726
We'll set up a business and live!

1060
01:16:01,269 --> 01:16:02,736
Who do you think you are?

1061
01:16:02,804 --> 01:16:04,499
Mother Theresa of Calcutta?

1062
01:16:04,572 --> 01:16:06,904
Why are you covering up for that 
fat slob?

1063
01:16:06,974 --> 01:16:08,635
She can't even look after her son.

1064
01:16:08,709 --> 01:16:10,574
She's a delinquent and a bad mother.

1065
01:16:10,645 --> 01:16:11,976
And what are you?

1066
01:16:12,046 --> 01:16:14,014
Just another delinquent.

1067
01:16:14,082 --> 01:16:16,744
And mind what you say, Paulito is 
very sensitive.

1068
01:16:19,053 --> 01:16:20,714
Pauli, go into the bedroom.

1069
01:16:24,992 --> 01:16:26,254
Well, I'm off.

1070
01:16:26,327 --> 01:16:28,591
Yeah, this is like a boarding house.

1071
01:16:28,663 --> 01:16:31,928
Well, be seeing you.

1072
01:16:39,974 --> 01:16:42,841
Did you think that guy would fall 
in love with you?

1073
01:16:42,910 --> 01:16:44,070
You're so naive.

1074
01:16:49,884 --> 01:16:51,408
Why are you so nasty?

1075
01:16:51,486 --> 01:16:54,546
Always out for yourself, and
when something new happens...

1076
01:16:54,622 --> 01:16:57,716
to me you have to interfere,
and fuck me up.

1077
01:16:57,792 --> 01:16:59,953
It's for your own good, idiot.

1078
01:17:00,027 --> 01:17:03,963
Did I tell you how stupid it is for 
you to play the cello?

1079
01:17:04,031 --> 01:17:06,465
No matter what the teacher says,

1080
01:17:06,534 --> 01:17:09,435
you can't play it well
because your arms don't reach.

1081
01:17:09,504 --> 01:17:11,995
Size is size.
You have to accept it.

1082
01:17:12,073 --> 01:17:13,506
You accept your extra 20 centimeters.

1083
01:17:13,574 --> 01:17:16,304
The ones you're lacking, in brain 
and height!

1084
01:17:17,078 --> 01:17:18,443
That's a low blow.

1085
01:17:18,513 --> 01:17:20,310
You're a dwarf.
What kind do you expect?

1086
01:17:23,351 --> 01:17:25,148
- You're crazy.
- Me, crazy?

1087
01:17:25,219 --> 01:17:27,881
About what?
You stupid, ugly dwarf!

1088
01:17:27,955 --> 01:17:30,253
You're a thug!
Who could love you?

1089
01:17:30,324 --> 01:17:33,350
Who could put up with you?
Nobody!

1090
01:17:33,427 --> 01:17:36,294
You're lazy, useless, ignorant!

1091
01:17:36,364 --> 01:17:38,924
You couldn't find your ass with 
both hands.

1092
01:17:39,967 --> 01:17:41,059
You know what?

1093
01:17:41,135 --> 01:17:43,126
I'm going out with Paulito and when 
I come back...

1094
01:17:43,204 --> 01:17:45,229
I don't want to see you or the guitar.

1095
01:17:45,306 --> 01:17:47,638
The guitar is where the ironing 
board used to be.

1096
01:17:47,708 --> 01:17:50,006
The ironing board
shouldn't be under the bed!

1097
01:17:52,079 --> 01:17:54,070
And the money I lent you for 
the tickets,

1098
01:17:54,148 --> 01:17:56,673
I want it back in my account.

1099
01:17:56,751 --> 01:18:00,118
And you can keep the profit for 
yourself, forever!

1100
01:18:00,188 --> 01:18:01,052
Understand?

1101
01:18:10,565 --> 01:18:11,395
Tomas?

1102
01:18:13,134 --> 01:18:14,123
Oh, no.

1103
01:18:15,503 --> 01:18:17,198
There are no more cello classes.

1104
01:18:18,773 --> 01:18:20,297
Because Tomas doesn't live here 
anymore.

1105
01:18:47,501 --> 01:18:49,332
Where's Gustavo?

1106
01:18:49,403 --> 01:18:51,735
He went shopping with the kid.

1107
01:18:53,708 --> 01:18:55,642
- Are you Gogo?
- Yes.

1108
01:18:55,710 --> 01:18:58,975
Are you all right?
Shall I make you some tea?

1109
01:18:59,046 --> 01:19:02,072
I'll make some tea and you'll feel 
much better.

1110
01:19:09,223 --> 01:19:10,349
Don't work today.

1111
01:19:10,891 --> 01:19:11,755
Let me see.

1112
01:19:18,532 --> 01:19:19,430
Ugly.

1113
01:19:33,314 --> 01:19:34,144
Marieta!

1114
01:19:34,849 --> 01:19:37,716
What's up? 
I haven't seen you around for ages.

1115
01:19:37,785 --> 01:19:40,845
I've been working.
Not on the street.

1116
01:19:40,921 --> 01:19:43,651
- Working.
- And... how's Tomas?

1117
01:19:43,724 --> 01:19:45,658
Why don't you tell him to call me?

1118
01:19:45,726 --> 01:19:48,718
- He's really busy, love.
- He's got a girl, right?

1119
01:19:48,796 --> 01:19:50,855
My Tomas doesn't want a girl.

1120
01:19:54,502 --> 01:19:55,264
Yeah.

1121
01:19:56,504 --> 01:19:58,062
What's he up to?

1122
01:19:59,640 --> 01:20:01,505
The usual stuff.
He's doing well.

1123
01:20:02,009 --> 01:20:02,771
Yeah.

1124
01:20:03,411 --> 01:20:04,537
He's very generous.

1125
01:20:12,286 --> 01:20:13,719
You look lovely.

1126
01:20:19,794 --> 01:20:22,422
You know they're going to set up 
a candy stall?

1127
01:20:22,496 --> 01:20:23,485
Where?

1128
01:20:25,266 --> 01:20:26,563
Watch out!

1129
01:20:30,037 --> 01:20:31,868
You'll smell of black smoke all night.

1130
01:20:33,274 --> 01:20:34,536
You hear the latest?

1131
01:20:34,608 --> 01:20:37,372
You know Trico, 
the one who cut her hair?

1132
01:20:37,445 --> 01:20:39,174
- Yeah.
- Well...

1133
01:20:39,246 --> 01:20:41,874
She's passed the exams to be a judge 
and she's only...

1134
01:20:41,949 --> 01:20:43,439
doing the street for pleasure.

1135
01:20:47,688 --> 01:20:51,920
This idea of doing an
imitation of the Playboy bunny.

1136
01:20:53,427 --> 01:20:56,294
- No.
- What are you talking about?

1137
01:20:56,364 --> 01:20:57,661
Imitation?

1138
01:20:57,732 --> 01:20:59,393
These are original.

1139
01:20:59,467 --> 01:21:01,662
A guy from America gave them to me.

1140
01:21:42,276 --> 01:21:43,300
Bunny!

1141
01:21:43,811 --> 01:21:45,506
Have you seen Ice Box around?

1142
01:21:46,414 --> 01:21:48,245
What's up?
Is she sick?

1143
01:21:54,255 --> 01:21:58,692
She was killed a month ago.
A truck driver beat her up.

1144
01:21:58,759 --> 01:22:02,388
He stole all the money she made 
that night.

1145
01:22:02,463 --> 01:22:05,432
And he dumped her outside the city.

1146
01:22:05,499 --> 01:22:07,364
Why didn't you tell me?

1147
01:22:18,446 --> 01:22:20,004
Did you know her well?

1148
01:22:23,584 --> 01:22:25,051
Just from around here.

1149
01:22:32,793 --> 01:22:34,556
It's a whore's life.

1150
01:22:38,132 --> 01:22:39,360
Fuck you, Bunny.

1151
01:23:11,799 --> 01:23:16,498
~~ I'm a pixie. I'm a paperdoll.
I'm a cartoon. ~~

1152
01:23:16,570 --> 01:23:20,904
~~ I'm a chipper, cheerful free for all
and I light up a room. ~~

1153
01:23:20,975 --> 01:23:25,969
~~ I'm the color-me-happy girl,
Miss Live And Let Live. ~~

1154
01:23:26,046 --> 01:23:32,007
~~ And when they're out for blood,
I always give. ~~

1155
01:23:39,960 --> 01:23:42,292
~~ The man behind the counter 
looks like... ~~

1156
01:23:42,363 --> 01:23:45,161
~~ he's got a half a dozen places 
he'd rather be. ~~

1157
01:23:45,232 --> 01:23:49,965
~~ And furthermore it looks like he's
prepared to take it all out on me. ~~

1158
01:23:50,037 --> 01:23:54,838
~~ Buddy, I don't really care what your
problem is, don't make it mine. ~~

1159
01:23:54,909 --> 01:23:59,471
~~ Come on kids, let's all hold hands
and pretend we're having a good time. ~~

1160
01:23:59,547 --> 01:24:03,847
~~ Boys, boys, boys,
I'm looking for a good time. ~~

1161
01:24:03,918 --> 01:24:08,617
~~ Boys, boys, boys,
I'm ready for your love. ~~

1162
01:24:14,395 --> 01:24:19,264
~~ Maybe you don't like your job.
Maybe you didn't get enough sleep. ~~

1163
01:24:19,333 --> 01:24:24,134
~~ Nobody likes their job.
Nobody got enough sleep. ~~

1164
01:24:24,204 --> 01:24:29,198
~~ You just had the worst day of 
your life. ~~

1165
01:24:29,276 --> 01:24:32,268
~~ There's no escape and there's no 
excuse... ~~

1166
01:24:32,346 --> 01:24:37,545
~~ so just suck up, suck up and 
be nice. ~~

1167
01:24:39,186 --> 01:24:42,178
~~ Suck up and be nice. ~~

1168
01:24:44,024 --> 01:24:47,016
~~ Suck up and be nice. ~~

1169
01:24:47,628 --> 01:24:52,258
~~ Suck up, suck up and be nice. ~~

1170
01:24:53,667 --> 01:24:57,000
~~ Suck up and be nice. ~~

1171
01:24:58,472 --> 01:25:01,771
~~ Suck up and be nice. ~~

1172
01:25:03,277 --> 01:25:06,508
~~ Suck up and be nice. ~~

1173
01:25:07,982 --> 01:25:11,543
~~ Suck up and be nice. ~~

1174
01:25:12,920 --> 01:25:16,253
~~ Suck up and be nice. ~~

1175
01:26:01,235 --> 01:26:02,930
That's lovely, Raul.

1176
01:26:03,003 --> 01:26:06,769
You're like a ghost, you appear and 
disappear at will.

1177
01:26:08,709 --> 01:26:11,837
- Climb on behind.
- Where are you taking me?

1178
01:26:41,475 --> 01:26:42,271
Hello.

1179
01:26:47,781 --> 01:26:48,406
Hey.

1180
01:26:55,556 --> 01:26:56,580
Mom.

1181
01:27:06,266 --> 01:27:08,131
The extractor, mother!

1182
01:27:08,202 --> 01:27:09,601
How are you?

1183
01:27:21,014 --> 01:27:22,948
I said you're staying for lunch.

1184
01:27:23,016 --> 01:27:24,643
She said there's meat and vegetables.

1185
01:27:27,921 --> 01:27:30,355
- Do you like that?
- Yes, very much.

1186
01:27:42,836 --> 01:27:44,064
Good afternoon.

1187
01:28:17,871 --> 01:28:19,668
The walls are like paper.

1188
01:28:39,760 --> 01:28:40,317
Go on.

1189
01:28:42,729 --> 01:28:43,787
Stick it in.

1190
01:28:44,364 --> 01:28:45,296
Go on.

1191
01:28:51,505 --> 01:28:52,836
Come on.

1192
01:28:52,906 --> 01:28:55,033
All right, but then you do it to me.

1193
01:28:55,108 --> 01:28:56,507
Yeah, yeah.

1194
01:28:56,577 --> 01:28:58,704
- Give me a condom.
- There.

1195
01:28:59,446 --> 01:29:00,242
Come on.

1196
01:29:04,151 --> 01:29:05,311
Come on.

1197
01:29:06,086 --> 01:29:07,417
Give it to me.

1198
01:29:11,592 --> 01:29:12,286
Come on.

1199
01:29:13,193 --> 01:29:13,818
Come on.

1200
01:29:14,595 --> 01:29:15,027
Come on.

1201
01:29:22,402 --> 01:29:23,164
It's three.

1202
01:29:31,111 --> 01:29:32,976
That's it.
Give it to me.

1203
01:29:35,816 --> 01:29:39,877
...and now the series number for 
300,000 euros.

1204
01:29:40,520 --> 01:29:42,613
The series number is 45.

1205
01:29:49,663 --> 01:29:52,154
- Fucking hell, Raul.
- What?

1206
01:29:52,232 --> 01:29:54,632
The nosy bitch!

1207
01:29:55,602 --> 01:29:57,536
Your neighbor...

1208
01:29:57,604 --> 01:29:59,868
Don't stop.
Lower the blind.

1209
01:29:59,940 --> 01:30:01,202
It doesn't matter.

1210
01:30:01,275 --> 01:30:03,106
I don't believe it!

1211
01:30:03,877 --> 01:30:05,242
That's it, I'm coming!

1212
01:30:14,521 --> 01:30:17,012
Come on Sunday, it's my birthday.

1213
01:30:17,090 --> 01:30:18,580
My mother's cooking tripe.

1214
01:30:18,659 --> 01:30:20,183
I'll be working.

1215
01:30:20,260 --> 01:30:21,625
Not on a Sunday.

1216
01:30:41,348 --> 01:30:44,408
After lunch, you must have a siesta.

1217
01:30:44,484 --> 01:30:46,076
No, no!

1218
01:30:46,153 --> 01:30:47,916
I've got so much to do.

1219
01:30:50,857 --> 01:30:52,347
You look like Hedy Lamarr.

1220
01:31:03,737 --> 01:31:04,704
I'm serious.

1221
01:31:06,006 --> 01:31:09,305
Loading tomatoes and peaches has 
paid for the motorbike.

1222
01:31:11,011 --> 01:31:13,741
And I can pay the deposit on an 
apartment I've seen.

1223
01:31:13,814 --> 01:31:16,874
It's here, on the fourth floor.

1224
01:31:16,950 --> 01:31:19,475
A really nice apartment for a couple.

1225
01:31:21,288 --> 01:31:22,380
A bargain.

1226
01:31:28,996 --> 01:31:30,429
Do you like my dick?

1227
01:31:32,099 --> 01:31:32,997
Yes.

1228
01:31:35,702 --> 01:31:39,433
Do you like it a lot?
Tell me.

1229
01:31:39,506 --> 01:31:40,530
Mm-hmm.

1230
01:31:42,776 --> 01:31:44,243
Don't you think it's strange?

1231
01:31:46,079 --> 01:31:48,411
What?

1232
01:31:48,482 --> 01:31:52,111
That we're a couple and we've both 
got big dicks.

1233
01:31:55,822 --> 01:31:56,914
Look at fags.

1234
01:31:59,559 --> 01:32:03,017
Yeah, but I want to be a woman.

1235
01:32:03,096 --> 01:32:05,826
Since I was little, 
I've always wanted a huge pussy.

1236
01:32:08,935 --> 01:32:10,300
But you are a woman.

1237
01:32:12,606 --> 01:32:17,270
How can I be a woman...
with a dick like this?

1238
01:32:20,914 --> 01:32:22,142
I like it.

1239
01:32:26,987 --> 01:32:29,182
Will you like me with a pussy?

1240
01:32:29,256 --> 01:32:31,315
I don't know.

1241
01:32:31,391 --> 01:32:32,585
I don't see you as very active.

1242
01:33:17,637 --> 01:33:19,832
Mom didn't come to pick me up.

1243
01:33:21,208 --> 01:33:22,106
Come here.

1244
01:33:28,014 --> 01:33:29,504
Do you like the bird?

1245
01:33:29,583 --> 01:33:31,676
No, it's ugly.

1246
01:33:46,566 --> 01:33:47,328
Who is it?

1247
01:33:48,001 --> 01:33:51,129
Maria, it's me, Berta.

1248
01:33:51,204 --> 01:33:54,173
- I'm back.
- Shit, I'd forgotten!

1249
01:33:54,708 --> 01:33:57,973
- Everything all right?
- Perfect, we're rich, Marieta.

1250
01:33:58,845 --> 01:34:03,475
Listen, bring Paulito to the bus
station tonight at midnight.

1251
01:34:03,550 --> 01:34:04,847
- I'll wait in the washroom.
- OK.

1252
01:34:04,918 --> 01:34:06,510
- Did you hear?
- Yes.

1253
01:34:06,586 --> 01:34:08,781
I heard the dwarf was arrested.

1254
01:34:08,855 --> 01:34:09,913
What happened?

1255
01:34:09,990 --> 01:34:10,786
Tomas?

1256
01:34:12,225 --> 01:34:15,092
He tried to 
hold up the local Chinese store.

1257
01:34:15,162 --> 01:34:18,029
He did it the old way, 
with his finger under his sweater...

1258
01:34:18,098 --> 01:34:19,759
Like it was a gun.

1259
01:34:19,833 --> 01:34:21,027
For God's sake!

1260
01:34:24,437 --> 01:34:25,335
He's at the far end.

1261
01:34:25,906 --> 01:34:27,533
Just five minutes.

1262
01:34:27,607 --> 01:34:29,768
- Thanks, pet.
- See you later.

1263
01:34:38,852 --> 01:34:39,978
What did they do?

1264
01:34:42,022 --> 01:34:43,250
You look terrible.

1265
01:34:44,591 --> 01:34:48,186
Why rob the Chinese store on your 
own street?

1266
01:34:49,496 --> 01:34:50,656
They know you.

1267
01:34:51,665 --> 01:34:53,223
I wore a balaclava.

1268
01:34:53,300 --> 01:34:54,824
You're a dwarf, Tomas.

1269
01:34:54,901 --> 01:34:56,664
How many dwarves live in the area?

1270
01:34:58,138 --> 01:34:59,366
Did they hit you?

1271
01:34:59,439 --> 01:35:02,272
Tell me... 
even if they told you to say nothing.

1272
01:35:04,244 --> 01:35:06,212
They beat you up.

1273
01:35:06,279 --> 01:35:07,974
It was the Chinese woman.

1274
01:35:08,048 --> 01:35:10,710
She had a bat behind the counter 
and she hit me here,

1275
01:35:10,784 --> 01:35:12,251
on the side.

1276
01:35:12,319 --> 01:35:13,718
She clobbered me.

1277
01:35:15,088 --> 01:35:16,749
You can't trust the Chinese.

1278
01:35:17,624 --> 01:35:21,116
They eat cats, 
and cats are treacherous.

1279
01:35:21,194 --> 01:35:22,627
Get me out of here.

1280
01:35:22,696 --> 01:35:25,130
Tomas, you men are so difficult.

1281
01:35:26,366 --> 01:35:28,197
Why were you stealing?

1282
01:35:28,268 --> 01:35:29,735
Have you ever gone short?

1283
01:35:29,803 --> 01:35:33,204
Tell me, 
because I don't understand.

1284
01:35:33,273 --> 01:35:35,298
I couldn't sell the tickets.

1285
01:35:35,375 --> 01:35:36,842
For the opera.

1286
01:35:36,910 --> 01:35:40,209
I only sold one season ticket to
one of my teacher's friends.

1287
01:35:40,280 --> 01:35:42,771
I owed you that money.

1288
01:35:42,849 --> 01:35:45,044
Why do you take me so seriously?

1289
01:35:45,118 --> 01:35:46,608
Really!

1290
01:35:46,686 --> 01:35:48,449
For the operation on your pecker.

1291
01:35:56,429 --> 01:35:58,363
Look after him until I get back.

1292
01:35:58,431 --> 01:36:00,558
- For the good times.
- There were quite a few.

1293
01:36:02,602 --> 01:36:05,162
I'll give you a fling later, my treat.

1294
01:36:05,238 --> 01:36:07,103
You know what I like.

1295
01:36:07,173 --> 01:36:08,333
It's a deal!

1296
01:36:16,650 --> 01:36:18,515
We're going!

1297
01:36:18,585 --> 01:36:20,212
Paulito, get your stuff.

1298
01:36:20,287 --> 01:36:21,879
Gustavo, bring the car around.

1299
01:36:21,955 --> 01:36:23,013
What's up?

1300
01:36:23,089 --> 01:36:24,681
I'll explain later.

1301
01:36:24,758 --> 01:36:26,851
And you, love, lend me some clothes.

1302
01:36:26,926 --> 01:36:29,360
- Sure.
- Thank you.

1303
01:36:30,063 --> 01:36:33,521
- Go left, go left, darling.
- Don't make him nervous.

1304
01:36:33,600 --> 01:36:38,560
- Keep quiet in the back.
- Don't make me anxious.

1305
01:36:38,638 --> 01:36:41,664
No, no, no, relax a bit.

1306
01:36:42,342 --> 01:36:46,335
~~ High school girl, high school girl. ~~

1307
01:36:46,413 --> 01:36:48,438
~~ I've fallen in love with the teacher. ~~

1308
01:36:48,515 --> 01:36:50,380
~~ I can't help it. ~~

1309
01:36:50,450 --> 01:36:53,010
~~ High school girl, high school girl. ~~

1310
01:36:54,154 --> 01:36:55,678
TOILETS

1311
01:36:58,825 --> 01:36:59,655
Berta!

1312
01:37:00,560 --> 01:37:01,754
Berta!

1313
01:37:02,195 --> 01:37:03,890
Are you here?

1314
01:37:03,963 --> 01:37:04,987
Mommy?

1315
01:37:05,065 --> 01:37:06,623
I'm in the last stall.

1316
01:37:12,172 --> 01:37:13,161
Come in!

1317
01:37:15,041 --> 01:37:16,099
Hey.

1318
01:37:16,176 --> 01:37:17,837
Hello, Mommy!

1319
01:37:19,012 --> 01:37:21,845
Darling!
I can hardly see you!

1320
01:37:23,850 --> 01:37:24,612
What?

1321
01:37:25,852 --> 01:37:27,547
Berta, I've got a plan.

1322
01:37:27,620 --> 01:37:29,747
No, it's OK.
It all worked out.

1323
01:37:29,823 --> 01:37:30,949
Oh?

1324
01:37:31,024 --> 01:37:32,355
No one's looking for us.

1325
01:37:34,461 --> 01:37:36,656
We're going to my parents for a week.

1326
01:37:36,730 --> 01:37:38,755
Then I'm taking Paulito to see Brazil.

1327
01:37:38,832 --> 01:37:40,800
- Yes!
- Yes, love.

1328
01:37:40,867 --> 01:37:42,198
I'm delighted.

1329
01:37:42,268 --> 01:37:43,633
Look, just take what's essential.

1330
01:37:43,703 --> 01:37:45,136
I'll sort out the tickets.

1331
01:37:50,176 --> 01:37:51,006
I can't.

1332
01:38:00,620 --> 01:38:02,713
Here.
A gift from Paulito and me.

1333
01:38:05,358 --> 01:38:06,723
No, really.

1334
01:38:06,793 --> 01:38:08,454
I can afford it.

1335
01:38:08,528 --> 01:38:10,189
Go on, take it.

1336
01:38:10,263 --> 01:38:16,065
~~ Imagining what isn't there. ~~

1337
01:38:16,136 --> 01:38:18,366
Don't cry, Maria, that's what men do.

1338
01:38:18,438 --> 01:38:28,575
~~ You pretend to be dead...
in your own song. ~~

1339
01:38:28,648 --> 01:38:35,383
~~ And you know you will fall
without a safety net. ~~

1340
01:38:36,356 --> 01:38:42,955
~~ You will go up in the trapeze of 
champagne. ~~

1341
01:38:43,029 --> 01:38:45,463
~~ And under your feet... ~~

1342
01:38:45,532 --> 01:38:49,559
- How much was the bail?
- Nothing, not much.

1343
01:38:49,636 --> 01:38:51,467
Want breakfast?

1344
01:38:51,538 --> 01:39:00,742
~~ Tears twirl around in your head. ~~

1345
01:39:00,814 --> 01:39:05,911
~~ There is no more wire,
there is nothing... ~~

1346
01:39:13,259 --> 01:39:15,625
Go on up, Tomas.
I won't be long.

1347
01:39:15,695 --> 01:39:17,287
All right, but hurry up.

1348
01:39:31,611 --> 01:39:32,873
It's my brother's birthday.

1349
01:39:35,348 --> 01:39:36,645
Mom made tripe for you.

1350
01:39:39,219 --> 01:39:41,710
I've had a tough night, pet.

1351
01:39:41,788 --> 01:39:44,621
I don't think I'm going to your parents 
for lunch.

1352
01:39:47,827 --> 01:39:48,919
All right.

1353
01:39:52,799 --> 01:39:54,960
And I don't think we're staying 
together.

1354
01:39:56,169 --> 01:39:57,227
You and me.

1355
01:40:03,309 --> 01:40:04,503
You're leaving me?

1356
01:40:05,912 --> 01:40:07,174
How can you leave me?

1357
01:40:08,982 --> 01:40:12,042
If you think you've got more right, 
you leave me.

1358
01:40:22,529 --> 01:40:24,827
Don't you see we've got a problem?

1359
01:40:26,165 --> 01:40:27,189
What is it?

1360
01:40:28,601 --> 01:40:30,831
I want a pussy, you idiot.

1361
01:40:30,904 --> 01:40:33,099
And you're crazy about my dick.

1362
01:40:36,042 --> 01:40:37,407
That's a little problem.

1363
01:40:42,515 --> 01:40:44,710
A twenty centimeter problem.

1364
01:42:41,100 --> 01:42:43,295
~~ I want to break free. ~~

1365
01:42:45,171 --> 01:42:47,867
~~ I want to break free. ~~

1366
01:42:49,409 --> 01:42:52,139
~~ I want to break free from your lies. ~~

1367
01:42:52,211 --> 01:42:57,581
~~ You're so self satisfied,
I don't need you. ~~

1368
01:42:57,650 --> 01:43:00,278
~~ I've got to break free. ~~

1369
01:43:02,755 --> 01:43:08,990
~~ God knows,
God knows I want to break free. ~~

1370
01:43:10,463 --> 01:43:13,762
~~ I've fallen in love. ~~

1371
01:43:13,833 --> 01:43:18,202
~~ I've fallen in love for the first time. ~~

1372
01:43:18,271 --> 01:43:22,867
~~ And this time, I know it's for real. ~~

1373
01:43:22,942 --> 01:43:26,969
~~ I've fallen in love, yeah. ~~

1374
01:43:27,046 --> 01:43:33,178
~~ God knows,
God knows I've fallen in love. ~~

1375
01:43:36,756 --> 01:43:39,919
~~ It's strange but it's true. ~~

1376
01:43:39,992 --> 01:43:41,084
~~ Yeah! ~~

1377
01:43:41,160 --> 01:43:44,789
~~ I can't get over the way you love 
me like you do. ~~

1378
01:43:44,864 --> 01:43:49,597
~~ But I have to be sure when I walk 
out that door. ~~

1379
01:43:49,669 --> 01:43:53,696
~~ Oh how I want to be free, baby. ~~

1380
01:43:53,773 --> 01:43:57,641
~~ Oh how I want to be free. ~~

1381
01:43:57,710 --> 01:44:01,840
~~ Oh how I want to break free. ~~

1382
01:44:36,449 --> 01:44:38,679
~~ But life still goes on. ~~

1383
01:44:40,386 --> 01:44:43,253
~~ I can't get used to
living without living without... ~~

1384
01:44:43,322 --> 01:44:48,316
~~ living without you by my side. ~~

1385
01:44:48,394 --> 01:44:53,388
~~ I don't want to live alone, hey! ~~

1386
01:44:53,466 --> 01:44:59,928
~~ God knows, 
got to make it on my own. ~~

1387
01:45:01,574 --> 01:45:08,707
~~ So baby can't you see
I've got to break free? ~~

1388
01:45:09,749 --> 01:45:20,751
~~ I've got to break free.
I want to break free, yeah. ~~

1389
01:45:23,996 --> 01:45:35,373
~~ I want, I want, I want,
I want to break free. ~~

1390
01:46:10,042 --> 01:46:15,378
~~ I want the moon that illuminates... ~~

1391
01:46:17,884 --> 01:46:22,378
~~ your silhouette as you walk. ~~

1392
01:46:25,625 --> 01:46:30,585
~~ with a ballerina's steps. ~~

1393
01:46:33,566 --> 01:46:38,060
~~ You follow her, never looking. ~~

1394
01:46:41,107 --> 01:46:46,807
~~ I want you to come full of love... ~~

1395
01:46:48,948 --> 01:46:53,851
~~ and embrace me when you arrive. ~~

1396
01:46:56,789 --> 01:47:01,749
~~ When you feel so lucky... ~~

1397
01:47:04,430 --> 01:47:09,424
~~ and you laugh as you kiss. ~~

1398
01:47:12,538 --> 01:47:17,566
~~ I want the calm of the evening... ~~

1399
01:47:20,313 --> 01:47:25,114
~~ when night begins to fall. ~~

1400
01:47:28,054 --> 01:47:33,082
~~ It's the twilight that burns... ~~

1401
01:47:35,761 --> 01:47:40,425
~~ as my love burns for you. ~~

1402
01:47:43,436 --> 01:47:49,136
~~ I want your hand to guide me... ~~

1403
01:47:51,210 --> 01:47:55,977
~~ if I'm in the dark. ~~

1404
01:47:59,218 --> 01:48:04,315
~~ And my heart will smile... ~~

1405
01:48:06,959 --> 01:48:11,453
~~ full of happiness. ~~

1406
01:48:14,800 --> 01:48:19,999
~~ I want your mist-colored eyes... ~~

1407
01:48:22,541 --> 01:48:27,376
~~ that I see at times in dreams. ~~

1408
01:48:30,349 --> 01:48:35,548
~~ They're like a cloak of sweetness... ~~

1409
01:48:38,391 --> 01:48:45,354
~~ that comes to waken me. ~~
