1
00:00:20,449 --> 00:00:21,746
Coffee?

2
00:00:30,792 --> 00:00:31,986
Coffee, Rick?

3
00:00:32,060 --> 00:00:33,391
All right,
come on, Peggy.

4
00:00:33,462 --> 00:00:35,521
lt'll serve you right
if you get burned.

5
00:00:35,597 --> 00:00:37,656
lt won't be
the first time.

6
00:00:37,733 --> 00:00:39,633
Oh my,
aren't we bitter.

7
00:00:39,701 --> 00:00:41,168
That's no way
to start your vacation.

8
00:00:41,236 --> 00:00:42,362
lt's no vacation.

9
00:00:42,437 --> 00:00:43,870
Oh? No trouble, l hope.

10
00:00:43,939 --> 00:00:45,804
Well, l'm going home
to get away from trouble.

11
00:00:45,874 --> 00:00:47,432
Now there's a switch,
even for you.

12
00:00:47,509 --> 00:00:48,476
Uh...

13
00:00:50,846 --> 00:00:52,006
Oh, thank you.

14
00:00:52,080 --> 00:00:53,104
What's up, Rick?

15
00:00:53,181 --> 00:00:54,170
l got fired.

16
00:00:54,283 --> 00:00:55,545
Oh, l'm sorry.

17
00:00:55,617 --> 00:00:57,744
But, knowing you, you must
have brought it on yourself.

18
00:00:57,819 --> 00:00:58,751
Not this time.

19
00:00:58,820 --> 00:01:00,879
You'll find a spot
with another airline.

20
00:01:00,956 --> 00:01:02,287
Have you tried United?

21
00:01:02,357 --> 00:01:03,415
l've tried them all.

22
00:01:03,492 --> 00:01:05,119
But you're a good pilot.

23
00:01:05,193 --> 00:01:07,058
Well, nobody questions
my ability.

24
00:01:07,129 --> 00:01:08,221
lt's my reputation.

25
00:01:08,297 --> 00:01:09,958
Nobody will believe
l've changed.

26
00:01:10,032 --> 00:01:12,125
l know. lt's the girls
that stay the same.

27
00:01:12,267 --> 00:01:14,360
Believe it or not, this
time, l was innocent.

28
00:01:14,436 --> 00:01:16,404
l was sitting there flying,
minding my own business

29
00:01:16,471 --> 00:01:18,871
when this soft feminine voice
came over the intercom

30
00:01:18,940 --> 00:01:21,135
and told me there was something
smoldering in the galley.

31
00:01:21,243 --> 00:01:22,369
Don't tell me-- she was.

32
00:01:22,444 --> 00:01:23,638
Right.

33
00:01:23,712 --> 00:01:25,805
But l took it straight and
l went back to investigate.

34
00:01:25,881 --> 00:01:26,973
And she took
advantage of you.

35
00:01:27,049 --> 00:01:28,346
Are you going
to tell it, or am l?

36
00:01:28,417 --> 00:01:30,749
All right, so she didn't
take advantage of you.

37
00:01:30,819 --> 00:01:31,877
She kissed me.

38
00:01:31,953 --> 00:01:33,352
That doesn't
sound too bad.

39
00:01:33,422 --> 00:01:34,912
You never fought it before.

40
00:01:34,990 --> 00:01:36,116
Well, we hit some turbulence

41
00:01:36,191 --> 00:01:37,453
and we both wound up
on the deck

42
00:01:37,526 --> 00:01:38,754
in full view
of the passengers.

43
00:01:38,827 --> 00:01:40,317
Well, it makes
a good story.

44
00:01:40,395 --> 00:01:41,919
Uh, how about having
dinner with me tonight?

45
00:01:41,997 --> 00:01:43,157
Help me forget my troubles.

46
00:01:43,231 --> 00:01:44,289
Uh-uh.

47
00:01:44,366 --> 00:01:46,129
You've been away from
the islands too long, skipper.

48
00:01:46,201 --> 00:01:47,828
l got over you years ago.

49
00:01:47,903 --> 00:01:50,371
Well, thanks
for the sympathetic ear.

50
00:01:50,439 --> 00:01:51,929
Part of the service.

51
00:01:52,007 --> 00:01:55,943
Welcome to paradise,
Hawaiian style.

52
00:01:59,748 --> 00:02:03,240
Hawaii

53
00:02:03,318 --> 00:02:07,812
USA

54
00:02:07,889 --> 00:02:11,052
Hawaii

55
00:02:11,126 --> 00:02:15,119
USA

56
00:02:15,263 --> 00:02:18,755
We're flyin'

57
00:02:18,834 --> 00:02:22,326
Comin' your way

58
00:02:23,538 --> 00:02:25,563
Aloha

59
00:02:25,640 --> 00:02:30,270
Hawaii, USA

60
00:02:31,780 --> 00:02:34,874
Gee, it's great

61
00:02:34,950 --> 00:02:39,353
To be in that 50th state

62
00:02:39,421 --> 00:02:45,656
The land
of enchanted dreams

63
00:02:47,796 --> 00:02:51,027
What an isle

64
00:02:51,099 --> 00:02:55,593
Well, it's heaven,
tropical style

65
00:02:55,670 --> 00:02:59,367
Where love weaves a spell

66
00:02:59,441 --> 00:03:03,605
lt seems

67
00:03:03,678 --> 00:03:07,239
Gee, what fun

68
00:03:07,315 --> 00:03:11,513
Just to swim
and surf in the sun

69
00:03:11,586 --> 00:03:15,750
While the trade winds
caress

70
00:03:15,824 --> 00:03:17,951
The sea

71
00:03:20,061 --> 00:03:23,690
What a sight

72
00:03:23,765 --> 00:03:27,997
Those exotic scenes
of delight

73
00:03:28,069 --> 00:03:32,028
Are waiting for you

74
00:03:32,107 --> 00:03:35,008
And me

75
00:03:36,278 --> 00:03:39,907
Hawaii

76
00:03:39,981 --> 00:03:44,509
USA

77
00:03:44,586 --> 00:03:47,953
Hawaii

78
00:03:48,023 --> 00:03:51,049
USA...

79
00:04:16,751 --> 00:04:18,116
Thanks a lot, Johnny.

80
00:04:18,186 --> 00:04:20,654
Hey, missionary.

81
00:04:20,722 --> 00:04:23,122
Oh, hi, native.

82
00:04:23,191 --> 00:04:24,123
Welcome back to Paradise.

83
00:04:24,192 --> 00:04:25,216
Why didn't you wire me?

84
00:04:25,293 --> 00:04:27,022
l'd have been at the ramp
with a dozen Wahines.

85
00:04:27,095 --> 00:04:28,027
l wanted to surprise you.

86
00:04:28,096 --> 00:04:29,085
You did, you did.

87
00:04:29,164 --> 00:04:30,290
How much vacation time
you got?

88
00:04:30,365 --> 00:04:31,297
lndefinitely.

89
00:04:31,366 --> 00:04:32,594
l got, l got let out
of the airlines.

90
00:04:32,667 --> 00:04:34,134
So, what happened
this time? What'd you do?

91
00:04:34,269 --> 00:04:35,702
You'd never believe it.

92
00:04:35,770 --> 00:04:37,101
All right, don't tell me.

93
00:04:37,172 --> 00:04:38,469
So what'll you do now,
missionary?

94
00:04:38,540 --> 00:04:39,973
Aw, come on, Danny,
there hasn't been

95
00:04:40,041 --> 00:04:41,872
a missionary in my family
for a hundred years.

96
00:04:41,943 --> 00:04:42,875
You know that.

97
00:04:42,944 --> 00:04:44,241
You can take the boy
out of the church

98
00:04:44,312 --> 00:04:46,371
but you can't keep his hands
out of the cookie jar.

99
00:04:46,448 --> 00:04:47,813
Who was the cookie?

100
00:04:47,883 --> 00:04:49,043
All right,
she was a stewardess.

101
00:04:49,117 --> 00:04:50,311
But l had nothing
to do with it.

102
00:04:50,385 --> 00:04:51,317
All l had on my mind

103
00:04:51,386 --> 00:04:53,081
was helping her put out
the fire in the galley.

104
00:04:53,154 --> 00:04:54,086
And what was on fire?

105
00:04:54,155 --> 00:04:55,087
She was.

106
00:04:56,157 --> 00:04:57,317
Hey, maybe you
can give me a job.

107
00:04:57,392 --> 00:04:59,383
Are you out of your
pineapple-pickin' mind?

108
00:04:59,461 --> 00:05:01,725
l go for days without even
a sniff of a customer

109
00:05:01,796 --> 00:05:03,423
and with five kids to feed.

110
00:05:03,498 --> 00:05:04,430
You got five kids?

111
00:05:04,499 --> 00:05:05,431
At last count.

112
00:05:05,500 --> 00:05:06,933
What are you trying to do,
sink the island?

113
00:05:07,002 --> 00:05:09,232
Well, l've got
this nervous habit...

114
00:05:09,304 --> 00:05:11,329
Well, you better try
biting your nails.

115
00:05:11,406 --> 00:05:14,239
Hey, l set some lobster
nets out on the reef.

116
00:05:14,309 --> 00:05:15,867
How about a lobster luau?

117
00:05:15,944 --> 00:05:17,673
You haven't seen Betty
for a long time.

118
00:05:17,746 --> 00:05:18,713
Well, l'd like to, Danny

119
00:05:18,780 --> 00:05:20,008
but l've got to find a job
and a place to live.

120
00:05:20,081 --> 00:05:21,013
Tomorrow.

121
00:05:21,082 --> 00:05:22,106
Tonight, you stay with us.

122
00:05:22,250 --> 00:05:24,115
ln the morning, you can take
my car and go find a job.

123
00:05:24,185 --> 00:05:25,777
-Five kids?
-Yeah.

124
00:05:25,854 --> 00:05:27,651
You got yourself a baby-sitter.

125
00:05:27,722 --> 00:05:28,848
Finish it up, Earl.

126
00:05:42,938 --> 00:05:44,064
ls this a picnic, Mama?

127
00:05:44,139 --> 00:05:45,800
lt's a welcome home party
for Uncle Rick.

128
00:05:45,874 --> 00:05:46,806
Now watch your step.

129
00:05:46,875 --> 00:05:48,137
l have the biggest watermelon!

130
00:05:48,243 --> 00:05:49,141
No, l do.

131
00:05:49,244 --> 00:05:50,404
Now, now, no fighting.

132
00:05:50,478 --> 00:05:51,809
Now be careful,
that's heavy.

133
00:05:53,315 --> 00:05:54,247
Here you go, Rick.

134
00:05:54,316 --> 00:05:56,250
Papaya and liquid oxygen.

135
00:05:56,318 --> 00:05:57,842
What time do l blast off?

136
00:05:57,919 --> 00:06:00,046
You won't know a thing
until you're in orbit.

137
00:06:00,121 --> 00:06:01,486
lt's the reentry
that's rough.

138
00:06:01,556 --> 00:06:03,854
Are you two reminiscing
about old times?

139
00:06:03,925 --> 00:06:04,857
We're just talking

140
00:06:04,926 --> 00:06:06,291
about Rick's little
adventure with a...

141
00:06:06,361 --> 00:06:07,328
Uh, uh...

142
00:06:07,395 --> 00:06:08,919
l think the kids
would like to hear about

143
00:06:08,997 --> 00:06:10,191
my, uh, skin-diving off Malibu.

144
00:06:10,265 --> 00:06:11,232
That would be fun.

145
00:06:11,299 --> 00:06:12,732
Yeah, sit down.

146
00:06:12,801 --> 00:06:16,293
Well, l was down about 50 feet,
and l got lost.

147
00:06:16,371 --> 00:06:19,340
And a beautiful mermaid came by
and offered me a can of tuna.

148
00:06:19,407 --> 00:06:20,669
Oh, Uncle Rick...

149
00:06:20,742 --> 00:06:22,300
What happened then,
Uncle Rick?

150
00:06:22,377 --> 00:06:24,504
Well, uh, uh...
l ate the tuna, see...

151
00:06:24,579 --> 00:06:27,343
and, uh, l held my breath
and l started swimming

152
00:06:27,415 --> 00:06:29,007
and l swam all the way here.

153
00:06:29,084 --> 00:06:30,483
That's why l'm so tired.

154
00:06:30,552 --> 00:06:31,951
But you came
in Daddy's car.

155
00:06:32,020 --> 00:06:33,112
We saw you.

156
00:06:33,188 --> 00:06:37,284
Mmm, well, actually, the,
uh, the real truth is, uh...

157
00:06:37,359 --> 00:06:38,917
l flew from
San Francisco, see

158
00:06:38,994 --> 00:06:40,018
and my wings are tired.

159
00:06:40,095 --> 00:06:41,585
But only angels
have wings.

160
00:06:41,663 --> 00:06:44,530
And you're no angel,
because l heard Daddy say so.

161
00:06:45,800 --> 00:06:46,994
Big mouth.

162
00:06:47,068 --> 00:06:48,899
Why don't you take the kids
and go help your mother?

163
00:06:48,970 --> 00:06:50,096
Okay, l'll go.

164
00:06:50,171 --> 00:06:51,968
But don't believe
any of his stories, Mommy.

165
00:06:52,040 --> 00:06:53,098
Oh, no, no, no, no.

166
00:06:53,174 --> 00:06:54,402
Number-one child's
very bright.

167
00:06:54,476 --> 00:06:55,443
They all are.

168
00:06:55,510 --> 00:06:57,102
lt's tough
to keep up with them.

169
00:06:57,178 --> 00:06:58,770
Yeah, it must be tough
to keep track of them.

170
00:06:58,847 --> 00:07:01,008
Ah, you'll find out
one of these days.

171
00:07:01,082 --> 00:07:02,913
Him married?
Not a chance.

172
00:07:02,984 --> 00:07:05,544
Marriage and children
are for squares like us.

173
00:07:05,620 --> 00:07:07,645
l'm glad
you're back, Rick.

174
00:07:07,722 --> 00:07:09,519
lt gets dull
without you around.

175
00:07:09,591 --> 00:07:11,889
You know, no planes
being taxied into offices

176
00:07:11,960 --> 00:07:13,723
on New Year's Eve,
no girls calling

177
00:07:13,795 --> 00:07:15,888
at all hours of the night
looking for you

178
00:07:15,964 --> 00:07:17,795
no irate fathers
writing to newspapers...

179
00:07:17,866 --> 00:07:19,993
Yeah, l guess l did burn
some bridges behind me.

180
00:07:20,068 --> 00:07:22,093
Well, you can always
go back to crop dusting

181
00:07:22,170 --> 00:07:24,104
or, or working for
the Blackmont outfit.

182
00:07:24,172 --> 00:07:25,332
l hear they're
looking for someone

183
00:07:25,407 --> 00:07:26,601
to pilot
their helicopters.

184
00:07:26,675 --> 00:07:28,267
Oh, l'm not
that desperate.

185
00:07:28,343 --> 00:07:29,275
Where will
you live, Rick?

186
00:07:29,344 --> 00:07:30,504
l'll get an apartment
in Eva Beach.

187
00:07:30,578 --> 00:07:31,772
Well, there goes
that neighborhood.

188
00:07:31,846 --> 00:07:32,870
Oh!

189
00:07:32,947 --> 00:07:34,549
Hey, kids,
quiet it down!

190
00:07:34,616 --> 00:07:36,243
We want Queenie!

191
00:07:36,317 --> 00:07:38,785
Maya-maya,
where's my papaya?

192
00:07:38,853 --> 00:07:40,878
Boolu-boolu,
it's in Honolulu.

193
00:07:40,955 --> 00:07:44,857
Boolu-boolu,
it's in Honolulu.

194
00:07:44,926 --> 00:07:47,554
Hey, Uncle Rick, look.
l'm Queenie Wahine.

195
00:07:47,629 --> 00:07:49,995
You know,
you look like a little queen.

196
00:07:50,065 --> 00:07:52,397
Come on, Uncle Rick,
tell us about Queenie Wahine.

197
00:07:52,467 --> 00:07:54,094
Come on, tell us a story!

198
00:07:57,138 --> 00:08:01,006
She sells sea shells,
by the seashore

199
00:08:01,076 --> 00:08:05,479
But l know a gal
who sells so much more

200
00:08:05,547 --> 00:08:09,711
Queenie Wahine's papaya
rates higher

201
00:08:09,784 --> 00:08:13,015
Than pineapple,
pumpkin or poi

202
00:08:13,088 --> 00:08:16,421
Please pick her papaya

203
00:08:16,491 --> 00:08:22,088
Put Queenie Wahine
in perfect, perpetual joy

204
00:08:22,230 --> 00:08:27,031
Though some peoples' palates
prefer pickle salads

205
00:08:27,102 --> 00:08:30,731
Plum pudding,
pink popcorn, peach pie

206
00:08:30,805 --> 00:08:34,866
Oh, Queenie's papaya
you'll truly desire

207
00:08:34,943 --> 00:08:39,676
When that Queenie Wahine
passes by

208
00:08:39,748 --> 00:08:43,445
Queenie Wahine's papaya
rates higher

209
00:08:43,518 --> 00:08:46,419
Than pineapple,
pumpkin or poi

210
00:08:46,488 --> 00:08:49,048
Please pick her papaya

211
00:08:49,124 --> 00:08:53,823
Put Queenie Wahine
in perfect, perpetual joy

212
00:08:53,895 --> 00:08:57,695
Though some people's palates
prefer pickle salads

213
00:08:57,766 --> 00:08:58,698
Plum pudding

214
00:08:58,767 --> 00:08:59,699
Pink popcorn

215
00:08:59,768 --> 00:09:00,860
Peach pie

216
00:09:00,935 --> 00:09:04,063
Oh, Queenie's papaya
you'll truly desire

217
00:09:04,172 --> 00:09:08,165
When that Queenie Wahine
passes by

218
00:09:08,243 --> 00:09:10,473
Queenie Wahine's
papaya rates higher

219
00:09:10,545 --> 00:09:12,638
Than pineapple,
pumpkin or poi

220
00:09:12,714 --> 00:09:14,682
Please pick her papaya

221
00:09:14,749 --> 00:09:17,684
Put Queenie Wahine
in perfect, perpetual joy

222
00:09:17,752 --> 00:09:21,347
Though some people's palates
prefer pickle salads

223
00:09:21,422 --> 00:09:23,982
Plum pudding,
pink popcorn, peach pie

224
00:09:24,058 --> 00:09:26,322
Oh, Queenie's papaya
you'll truly desire

225
00:09:26,394 --> 00:09:28,828
When that Queenie Wahine
passes by.

226
00:09:30,899 --> 00:09:32,560
You're fun, Uncle Rick!
You're fun!

227
00:09:32,634 --> 00:09:34,363
Hey, Uncle Rick!

228
00:09:51,419 --> 00:09:53,114
Hey, Danny, you got
room for one more?

229
00:09:53,188 --> 00:09:54,746
Sure, hop in.

230
00:10:15,276 --> 00:10:18,803
Mr. Cubberson
is in alligator shoes.

231
00:10:18,880 --> 00:10:20,507
Hmm, so l see.

232
00:10:20,582 --> 00:10:21,844
Yes, l certainly am.

233
00:10:21,916 --> 00:10:24,009
And our intention
is to see everyone

234
00:10:24,085 --> 00:10:26,019
in alligator shoes,
Mister, uh...

235
00:10:26,087 --> 00:10:27,452
Uh, Richards.
Rick Richards.

236
00:10:27,522 --> 00:10:29,012
-Aloha.
-Aloha.

237
00:10:29,090 --> 00:10:31,524
Mr. Cubberson's on his way
to the shoe convention on Maui.

238
00:10:31,593 --> 00:10:33,493
Oh, the boys
always depend on me

239
00:10:33,561 --> 00:10:35,392
for my old
keynote address.

240
00:10:35,463 --> 00:10:37,158
l mustn't be late
and let them down.

241
00:10:37,265 --> 00:10:40,063
They know they can
count on Cubberson.

242
00:10:40,134 --> 00:10:42,364
How'd it go?

243
00:10:42,437 --> 00:10:44,132
lt's rough out.

244
00:10:44,205 --> 00:10:45,536
That's too bad.

245
00:10:45,607 --> 00:10:47,040
You'll find
another spot.

246
00:10:47,108 --> 00:10:49,099
Good commercial
pilots are rare.

247
00:10:49,177 --> 00:10:51,111
And so are alligator shoes

248
00:10:51,179 --> 00:10:52,669
and that's
what we're trying to sell.

249
00:10:52,747 --> 00:10:54,715
Alligator shoes are a symbol

250
00:10:54,782 --> 00:10:57,342
of prestige,
of wealth, of importance.

251
00:10:57,418 --> 00:10:59,545
Hey, yeah, you're right,
Mr. Cubberson.

252
00:10:59,621 --> 00:11:01,782
Ah, l'm not going
back to work

253
00:11:01,856 --> 00:11:03,118
for somebody else,
Danny.

254
00:11:03,224 --> 00:11:05,715
Let me take the controls,
l want to show you

255
00:11:05,793 --> 00:11:07,522
a place l looked at
this morning.

256
00:11:09,364 --> 00:11:10,626
Why are we sinking?

257
00:11:10,698 --> 00:11:12,563
Where are the life jackets?

258
00:11:12,634 --> 00:11:14,329
Just a slight detour,
Mr. Cubberson.

259
00:11:14,402 --> 00:11:15,334
No extra charge.

260
00:11:15,403 --> 00:11:16,370
Oh, but l'm late now

261
00:11:16,437 --> 00:11:18,428
and l have
to make that opening speech.

262
00:11:18,506 --> 00:11:20,167
We'll get you there
in plenty of time.

263
00:11:57,178 --> 00:11:58,577
Beautiful, aren't they?

264
00:11:58,646 --> 00:12:01,308
Yeah, but, uh, so are

265
00:12:01,382 --> 00:12:03,213
Mr. Cubberson's
alligator shoes.

266
00:12:03,284 --> 00:12:04,876
What am l supposed
to be seeing?

267
00:12:04,953 --> 00:12:06,215
'Cause whatever it is,
l don't.

268
00:12:06,287 --> 00:12:08,016
Well, l came over to see
Blackmont, like you said

269
00:12:08,089 --> 00:12:09,317
but instead of
going to work for him

270
00:12:09,390 --> 00:12:11,221
we figured out a way
to scratch each other's backs.

271
00:12:11,292 --> 00:12:13,351
l sold him on going into
partnership with us.

272
00:12:13,428 --> 00:12:15,555
He scratches our backs
by putting up the choppers

273
00:12:15,630 --> 00:12:17,598
we scratch his
by putting up the service.

274
00:12:17,665 --> 00:12:18,927
Ah, what kind of service?

275
00:12:19,000 --> 00:12:20,126
A personal air service.

276
00:12:20,268 --> 00:12:21,633
Look, we both
know these islands, Danny.

277
00:12:21,703 --> 00:12:23,500
We could use the choppers
to fly tourists to places

278
00:12:23,571 --> 00:12:25,698
they could never reach by any
other means of transportation.

279
00:12:25,773 --> 00:12:26,933
Three passengers at a time?

280
00:12:27,008 --> 00:12:29,101
We couldn't afford it, and
neither could the customers.

281
00:12:29,177 --> 00:12:30,109
Why not?

282
00:12:30,178 --> 00:12:31,110
Cubberson has
the right idea.

283
00:12:31,179 --> 00:12:32,612
Give the people a little
something special

284
00:12:32,680 --> 00:12:33,612
and they'll pay for it.

285
00:12:33,681 --> 00:12:34,841
Two choppers
would make it pay us.

286
00:12:34,916 --> 00:12:36,577
And all we'd provide
is the service.

287
00:12:36,651 --> 00:12:37,811
Well, not exactly.

288
00:12:37,885 --> 00:12:40,046
Blackmont wants us
to put up $10,000 bond.

289
00:12:40,121 --> 00:12:41,452
Yeah, l knew
there was a catch.

290
00:12:41,522 --> 00:12:42,716
Where do we get
that kind of money?

291
00:12:42,790 --> 00:12:43,882
Well, my severance pay

292
00:12:43,958 --> 00:12:45,687
and the loan you're
going to get on your plane.

293
00:12:45,760 --> 00:12:47,159
And if we can't meet
the payments

294
00:12:47,228 --> 00:12:49,389
we lose both the choppers
and the bond, right?

295
00:12:49,464 --> 00:12:51,523
Ah, yes, but we won't
let that happen.

296
00:12:51,599 --> 00:12:52,588
Sorry, old buddy.

297
00:12:52,667 --> 00:12:55,158
l love you like a brother,
but it's too risky.

298
00:12:55,303 --> 00:12:57,430
Come on,
Cubberson's waiting.

299
00:13:28,469 --> 00:13:31,802
Aloha, aloha!

300
00:13:31,873 --> 00:13:33,033
Aloha!

301
00:13:33,107 --> 00:13:35,132
Gentlemen, l greet you.

302
00:13:35,209 --> 00:13:38,007
lt's delightful to be here.

303
00:13:42,116 --> 00:13:45,176
Oh, it's, it's good
to be well-liked.

304
00:13:50,291 --> 00:13:52,088
Danny, l'd like you
to meet somebody.

305
00:13:52,160 --> 00:13:53,855
We'll see you later,
Mr. Cubberson.

306
00:13:53,928 --> 00:13:55,896
Sure.

307
00:14:00,234 --> 00:14:02,134
Lehua!

308
00:14:03,171 --> 00:14:04,263
Do l know you?

309
00:14:05,506 --> 00:14:06,939
Allow me
to introduce myself.

310
00:14:07,008 --> 00:14:08,942
Rick Richards.
This is my buddy, Danny Kohana.

311
00:14:09,010 --> 00:14:10,102
Aren't you
a little late?

312
00:14:10,178 --> 00:14:11,270
Late?

313
00:14:11,345 --> 00:14:12,747
We had a date,
remember?

314
00:14:12,814 --> 00:14:15,783
Well, how could l forget? When?

315
00:14:15,850 --> 00:14:16,976
For dinner.

316
00:14:17,051 --> 00:14:19,042
June 4, two years ago.

317
00:14:19,120 --> 00:14:20,781
And you've been waiting
all this time?

318
00:14:20,855 --> 00:14:22,015
Well, you must
be starving.

319
00:14:22,090 --> 00:14:23,216
Not anymore.

320
00:14:23,291 --> 00:14:25,122
l ate my heart out
for a day or two.

321
00:14:25,193 --> 00:14:27,127
Lehua, l-l know l
gave you a bad time

322
00:14:27,195 --> 00:14:28,662
but l'm a
different guy now.

323
00:14:28,729 --> 00:14:30,822
Any change would
be an improvement.

324
00:14:30,898 --> 00:14:31,830
l said l was sorry.

325
00:14:31,899 --> 00:14:33,127
l'd like to make it up to you.

326
00:14:33,267 --> 00:14:34,666
How about joining us for lunch?

327
00:14:34,735 --> 00:14:36,896
Well, l'm on duty right now.

328
00:14:36,971 --> 00:14:38,700
What time do you have?

329
00:14:38,773 --> 00:14:40,138
12:18.

330
00:14:40,241 --> 00:14:43,540
Fine. l'll meet you
at exactly same time

331
00:14:43,611 --> 00:14:45,738
two years from today.

332
00:14:45,813 --> 00:14:48,043
Lehua, l got a proposition
for you.

333
00:14:48,116 --> 00:14:49,140
The same one?

334
00:14:49,283 --> 00:14:50,443
We can help each other.

335
00:14:50,518 --> 00:14:53,646
Sorry, we don't
provide that service anymore.

336
00:14:53,721 --> 00:14:55,120
lf you just listen for a minute.

337
00:14:55,189 --> 00:14:56,486
Look, Danny and l are starting

338
00:14:56,557 --> 00:14:58,047
a helicopter line
for the tourists.

339
00:14:58,126 --> 00:14:59,093
Hey, wait.

340
00:14:59,160 --> 00:15:01,151
We know these islands
better than anybody.

341
00:15:01,229 --> 00:15:03,697
We can take people to places
that nobody else can.

342
00:15:03,764 --> 00:15:04,696
And you can help

343
00:15:04,765 --> 00:15:06,323
by lining up some
passengers for us.

344
00:15:06,400 --> 00:15:07,492
Not me, honey.

345
00:15:07,568 --> 00:15:08,796
l been that route.

346
00:15:08,870 --> 00:15:11,100
When you take somebody
for a ride

347
00:15:11,239 --> 00:15:13,173
it's a long trip.

348
00:15:14,976 --> 00:15:16,375
Uh, chow time?

349
00:15:16,444 --> 00:15:17,570
l'm not giving up that easy.

350
00:15:17,645 --> 00:15:20,409
Don't go away.

351
00:15:20,481 --> 00:15:23,382
Lehua, two years ago, l
got sent to the mainland.

352
00:15:23,451 --> 00:15:25,612
l tried to phone
you before l left.

353
00:15:25,686 --> 00:15:28,018
For your cards and letters,
l thank you.

354
00:15:28,089 --> 00:15:31,752
Well, l'm not much for writing,
but l thought about you a lot.

355
00:15:31,826 --> 00:15:33,487
l wish l could believe that.

356
00:15:33,561 --> 00:15:36,359
lf you go along with us,
l'll prove it to you.

357
00:15:36,430 --> 00:15:39,228
Look, you're the only one
that can help us.

358
00:15:39,300 --> 00:15:40,562
l'll tell you what.

359
00:15:40,635 --> 00:15:43,604
You scratch my back,
and l'll scratch yours.

360
00:15:45,840 --> 00:15:48,070
Make bigger circles.

361
00:15:48,142 --> 00:15:51,407
Mmm, bigger, Rick.

362
00:15:52,813 --> 00:15:54,280
Mr. Kohana!

363
00:15:54,348 --> 00:15:55,975
Mr. Kohana!

364
00:15:56,050 --> 00:15:57,244
Shh!

365
00:15:57,318 --> 00:15:59,081
Quick, quick, we've got
to get to the plane.

366
00:15:59,153 --> 00:16:00,142
What's the matter?

367
00:16:00,221 --> 00:16:01,313
What's the matter?

368
00:16:01,389 --> 00:16:03,084
Uh, you've brought me
to the wrong convention

369
00:16:03,191 --> 00:16:04,180
is what's the matter.

370
00:16:04,258 --> 00:16:05,520
We're even on
the wrong island.

371
00:16:05,593 --> 00:16:06,685
Wrong convention?

372
00:16:06,761 --> 00:16:09,252
This is a convention
of the SPCA--

373
00:16:09,330 --> 00:16:13,266
the Society for the Prevention
of Cruelty to...

374
00:16:13,334 --> 00:16:14,494
Alligators.

375
00:16:14,569 --> 00:16:15,661
Oh, quick.

376
00:16:15,736 --> 00:16:17,533
We've got to get out of here.

377
00:16:17,605 --> 00:16:19,300
They're liable to lynch me.

378
00:16:19,373 --> 00:16:22,103
l'm supposed to be at
the Hanalei Plantation.

379
00:16:22,176 --> 00:16:23,768
But you said the Maui Sheraton.

380
00:16:23,844 --> 00:16:25,505
Well, l'm a stranger
around here.

381
00:16:25,580 --> 00:16:27,741
How am l supposed to
know where l'm going?

382
00:16:27,815 --> 00:16:29,339
That's the reason l hired you.

383
00:16:29,417 --> 00:16:30,679
No, you.

384
00:16:30,751 --> 00:16:31,945
Okay, Mr. Cubberson.
Let's go.

385
00:16:32,019 --> 00:16:33,111
Yeah, come on.

386
00:16:33,187 --> 00:16:34,279
Hey, that's great.

387
00:16:34,355 --> 00:16:36,255
l know another girl
at the Hanalei Plantation.

388
00:16:36,324 --> 00:16:37,655
She can do us a lot
of good, too.

389
00:16:37,725 --> 00:16:39,056
Spare me, will you,
Rick, buddy?

390
00:16:39,126 --> 00:16:40,115
You're wasting your time.

391
00:16:40,261 --> 00:16:41,353
Don't bet on it.

392
00:16:41,429 --> 00:16:43,021
Come on, come on.

393
00:16:43,097 --> 00:16:45,065
l'll talk to you
later, Lehua.

394
00:17:20,735 --> 00:17:22,862
Oh... Oh, well,
l'm here in plenty of time.

395
00:17:22,937 --> 00:17:25,030
l'd like to settle up
and buy you boys a drink?

396
00:17:25,106 --> 00:17:26,767
l'll take a rain
check, Mr. Cubberson.

397
00:17:26,841 --> 00:17:28,536
But don't forget us
on your next trip.

398
00:17:28,609 --> 00:17:29,701
Oh, no, l won't.

399
00:17:29,777 --> 00:17:31,039
l'll see you
later, Danny.

400
00:17:32,947 --> 00:17:35,006
Aren't you forgetting something,
Mr. Cubberson?

401
00:17:35,082 --> 00:17:36,106
Huh?

402
00:17:36,217 --> 00:17:37,343
Oh.

403
00:17:40,888 --> 00:17:42,947
Oh, thank you.

404
00:17:53,901 --> 00:17:55,926
Hey, Rick!

405
00:17:59,807 --> 00:18:01,934
Rick, welcome home!

406
00:18:02,009 --> 00:18:03,067
l'm glad to be back, Lani.

407
00:18:03,177 --> 00:18:04,940
l thought you were dead,
or worse, married.

408
00:18:05,012 --> 00:18:06,343
Well, l had a few crash landings

409
00:18:06,414 --> 00:18:07,540
but l managed to walk away.

410
00:18:07,615 --> 00:18:08,639
What's new in your life?

411
00:18:08,716 --> 00:18:09,740
Just an absence of you.

412
00:18:09,817 --> 00:18:10,909
Come on.

413
00:18:10,985 --> 00:18:11,974
Oh, where you taking me?

414
00:18:12,053 --> 00:18:12,985
Down to the Piki Niki.

415
00:18:13,054 --> 00:18:15,284
ln case you've forgotten,
l work here.

416
00:18:22,496 --> 00:18:24,430
ls Charlie running,
or do we walk?

417
00:18:24,498 --> 00:18:26,830
Well, he's still temperamental,
but let's risk it.

418
00:18:44,618 --> 00:18:46,779
Tell me you came back
to see me, Rick.

419
00:18:46,854 --> 00:18:48,219
Go ahead, lie a little.

420
00:18:48,289 --> 00:18:49,950
Well, the truth is
l'm trying to start

421
00:18:50,024 --> 00:18:51,719
a helicopter service
with Danny Kohana.

422
00:18:51,792 --> 00:18:53,760
We could fly people to
out-of-the-way places

423
00:18:53,828 --> 00:18:54,760
like Moonlight Beach.

424
00:18:54,829 --> 00:18:55,818
Rick, you remembered!

425
00:18:55,896 --> 00:18:58,091
Sure. lt was a long walk,
but it was worth it.

426
00:18:58,165 --> 00:19:00,133
Three days
of absolute heaven.

427
00:19:00,201 --> 00:19:01,566
When can we go again?

428
00:19:01,635 --> 00:19:03,000
Well, until l get
this business started

429
00:19:03,070 --> 00:19:04,833
l'm going to be pretty
busy, but there is a way.

430
00:19:04,905 --> 00:19:05,837
What's that?

431
00:19:05,906 --> 00:19:07,168
Well, you could
recommend our service

432
00:19:07,241 --> 00:19:08,765
to the hotel guests,
and l can combine work

433
00:19:08,843 --> 00:19:09,969
with the pleasure of seeing you.

434
00:19:10,044 --> 00:19:12,410
And l'd be helping you get
your business started, right?

435
00:19:12,480 --> 00:19:14,505
ln a way like
nobody else could.

436
00:19:14,582 --> 00:19:17,676
You scratch my back
and l'll scratch yours.

437
00:19:17,752 --> 00:19:19,083
Huh? What about it?

438
00:19:19,220 --> 00:19:21,711
Start scratching.

439
00:19:23,758 --> 00:19:26,556
And here she is,
and none too soon--

440
00:19:26,627 --> 00:19:29,858
Hanalei's own Lani Kaimana.

441
00:19:50,017 --> 00:19:55,421
One good turn deserves another

442
00:19:55,489 --> 00:20:01,450
Be my love, l'll be your lover

443
00:20:01,529 --> 00:20:04,362
lt's all part of nature's laws

444
00:20:04,432 --> 00:20:06,400
Ooba do-bop, do-bop

445
00:20:06,467 --> 00:20:07,661
lf you scratch my back

446
00:20:07,735 --> 00:20:08,827
Ooba do-bop, do-bop

447
00:20:08,903 --> 00:20:10,131
Then l'll scratch yours

448
00:20:10,204 --> 00:20:11,899
Ooba do-bop, a-dooba do-bop

449

lf you'll scratch-a my back

450
00:20:14,675 --> 00:20:16,836
Then l scratch-a your back

451
00:20:16,911 --> 00:20:19,971
Like two peas in a pack

452
00:20:20,047 --> 00:20:23,448
Let's get rid of our itch
together

453
00:20:35,362 --> 00:20:40,061
Joy, they say,
is in the givin'

454
00:20:40,134 --> 00:20:45,731
Come on, give,
make life worth livin'

455
00:20:45,806 --> 00:20:49,367
Your welfare is my concern

456
00:20:49,443 --> 00:20:50,603
Dooba do-bop, do-bop

457
00:20:50,678 --> 00:20:52,441
Do a favor for me

458
00:20:52,513 --> 00:20:53,605
Dooba do-bop, do-bop

l'll do one in return

460
00:20:55,082 --> 00:20:56,674
Dooba do-bop, a-dooba, do-bop

461
00:20:56,750 --> 00:20:59,685
lf you'll scratch-a my back

462
00:20:59,753 --> 00:21:02,517
Then l'll scratch-a your back

463
00:21:02,590 --> 00:21:04,956
Like two peas in a pack

464
00:21:05,025 --> 00:21:09,257
Let's get rid of our itch
together, hmm

465
00:21:13,968 --> 00:21:19,702
Scratch me now, a little lower

466
00:21:19,773 --> 00:21:25,712
What a feeling, do it slower

467
00:25:17,672 --> 00:21:29,550
[ Skipped item nr. 467 ]

468
00:21:29,550 --> 00:21:31,484
Well, l gotta admit

469
00:21:31,552 --> 00:21:32,917
Dooba, do-bop, do-bop

470
00:21:32,987 --> 00:21:34,147
You just hit the spot

471
00:21:34,255 --> 00:21:36,524
Dooba, do-bop, dooba, do-bop

472
00:21:36,590 --> 00:21:39,058
lf you'll scratch-a my back

473
00:21:39,126 --> 00:21:41,458
Then l'll scratch-a your back

474
00:21:41,529 --> 00:21:44,623
Like two peas in a pack

475
00:21:44,698 --> 00:21:47,394
Let's get rid of our itch

Then l'll scratch-a your back

478
00:21:52,640 --> 00:21:55,165
Like two peas in a pack

479
00:21:55,242 --> 00:21:59,042
Let's get rid of our itch
together.

480
00:22:25,739 --> 00:22:28,003
Hey, Danny, Blackmont
won't wait much longer.

481
00:22:28,075 --> 00:22:29,303
l mean, where would we be

482
00:22:29,376 --> 00:22:31,310
if Captain Cook
hadn't taken a chance?

483
00:22:31,378 --> 00:22:33,073
You'd probably be in a stew pot

484
00:22:33,147 --> 00:22:35,547
and my people would
still own the islands.

485
00:22:35,616 --> 00:22:37,345
Look, we're missing
a chance of a lifetime.

486
00:22:37,418 --> 00:22:38,407
lt could work just great

487
00:22:38,485 --> 00:22:40,112
with Lani and Lehua
sending us customers

488
00:22:40,187 --> 00:22:41,279
and there'll be more.

489
00:22:41,355 --> 00:22:42,652
Okay.

490
00:22:42,723 --> 00:22:44,384
l borrowed all the
cash l possibly could

491
00:22:44,458 --> 00:22:46,050
but l still can't
make it without you.

492
00:22:46,126 --> 00:22:47,616
l said okay.

493
00:22:47,695 --> 00:22:50,562
And if l don't pay it back,
l'll be in hock up to my neck.

494
00:22:50,631 --> 00:22:53,156
That should show how serious
l am about this thing.

495
00:22:53,267 --> 00:22:54,734
You said okay?

496
00:22:54,802 --> 00:22:56,167
l did.

497
00:22:56,236 --> 00:22:57,396
That means you'll go?

498
00:22:57,471 --> 00:22:58,938
l already made up my mind.

499
00:22:59,006 --> 00:23:01,236
Lani called
about a couple of firm deals

500
00:23:01,308 --> 00:23:03,401
and Lehua called
asking about prices.

501
00:23:03,477 --> 00:23:07,038
l may be a little pupule, but...

502
00:23:07,114 --> 00:23:09,639
shake, partner.

503
00:23:40,581 --> 00:23:43,106
''Danrick.'' Dan, Rick.

504
00:23:43,183 --> 00:23:44,241
Thanks for the billing.

505
00:23:44,318 --> 00:23:45,842
Well, we're in business now.

506
00:23:45,919 --> 00:23:47,648
Hey, but, uh, what's the lineup?

507
00:23:47,721 --> 00:23:49,484
Don't tell me
we've got customers already.

508
00:23:49,556 --> 00:23:50,648
Well, uh, not exactly.

509
00:23:50,724 --> 00:23:52,157
We need somebody
to mind the place

510
00:23:52,259 --> 00:23:53,351
while we're out

511
00:23:53,427 --> 00:23:54,917
so l advertised
for a Girl Friday.

512
00:23:54,995 --> 00:23:56,485
You sure it's not
a little something

513
00:23:56,563 --> 00:23:59,157
for Saturday and Sunday?

514
00:23:59,233 --> 00:24:00,564
All right, girls.

515
00:24:00,634 --> 00:24:03,296
Follow me inside and...

516
00:24:03,370 --> 00:24:05,531
l'll check out
your qualifications.

517
00:24:15,482 --> 00:24:16,414
lt's a good thing

518
00:24:16,483 --> 00:24:18,075
she doesn't have a
portable television.

519
00:24:18,152 --> 00:24:19,676
Where did you put the ad,
in ''Playboy''?

520
00:24:19,753 --> 00:24:21,721
This way, girls.

521
00:24:46,714 --> 00:24:47,806
Hi, Danny.

522
00:24:47,881 --> 00:24:50,441
Judy, what are you doing?

523
00:24:50,517 --> 00:24:52,712
l told Ben this is the last time
l'd rent this plane

524
00:24:52,786 --> 00:24:54,481
if he didn't get
the rudder cable fixed.

525
00:24:54,555 --> 00:24:57,149
You practicing for
the powder-puff derby?

526
00:24:57,224 --> 00:24:58,816
Ha! My mom won that

527
00:24:58,892 --> 00:25:01,019
when she was nothing
but a bored housewife.

528
00:25:01,095 --> 00:25:02,619
Anyway, l've had it for a while.

529
00:25:02,696 --> 00:25:05,290
l'm running too low on cash
to rent planes anymore.

530
00:25:05,365 --> 00:25:07,697
Judy, how would you
like to work for me?

531
00:25:07,768 --> 00:25:08,928
As a pilot?

532
00:25:09,002 --> 00:25:10,094
A pilot?!

533
00:25:10,204 --> 00:25:11,296
Why not?

534
00:25:11,371 --> 00:25:12,770
Women can set all kinds
of records

535
00:25:12,840 --> 00:25:15,035
but not one of you will let us
make a living flying.

536
00:25:15,109 --> 00:25:17,202
Well, maybe we can
talk about that later.

537
00:25:17,277 --> 00:25:18,471
Ever work in an office?

538
00:25:18,545 --> 00:25:19,637
Where do you think

539
00:25:19,713 --> 00:25:21,340
l get the money
to sink into flying?

540
00:25:21,415 --> 00:25:24,043
l've outrun some of the biggest
executives in Honolulu!

541
00:25:24,118 --> 00:25:26,211
Did you bring a
change of clothes?

542
00:25:26,286 --> 00:25:27,446
Sure. Why?

543
00:25:27,521 --> 00:25:28,613
Don't ask
any questions.

544
00:25:28,689 --> 00:25:31,749
Just get cleaned up.

545
00:25:31,825 --> 00:25:35,352
Here.

546
00:25:35,429 --> 00:25:37,226
l'll explain it later.

547
00:25:37,297 --> 00:25:38,355
Well, thanks a lot, girls

548
00:25:38,432 --> 00:25:40,127
and we'll get in touch
with you later on.

549
00:25:40,200 --> 00:25:41,394
Thank you.

550
00:25:41,468 --> 00:25:42,435
Thank you.

551
00:25:42,503 --> 00:25:44,334
-Good-bye.
-Bye.

552
00:25:46,206 --> 00:25:48,140
Well, your qualifications
look good.

553
00:25:48,275 --> 00:25:49,264
How's your typing?

554
00:25:49,343 --> 00:25:50,469
l hunt and peck.

555
00:25:50,544 --> 00:25:51,568
Yeah, l'll bet you do.

556
00:25:51,645 --> 00:25:52,771
You sit over at my desk

557
00:25:52,846 --> 00:25:54,837
and l'll be with you
in a minute.

558
00:25:56,250 --> 00:25:57,615
How's your shorthand?

559
00:25:57,684 --> 00:25:59,151
l take 180 words per minute.

560
00:25:59,219 --> 00:26:01,119
l also operate
a tabulating machine

561
00:26:01,188 --> 00:26:02,815
translate Hawaiian
and Japanese

562
00:26:02,890 --> 00:26:05,085
and l'm quite good
with a scalp massage.

563
00:26:05,159 --> 00:26:06,751
Yeah, uh, well,
you sit right over here

564
00:26:06,827 --> 00:26:08,852
and my partner will talk
to you in a few minutes.

565
00:26:08,929 --> 00:26:10,362
How are you
at answering the phone?

566
00:26:10,430 --> 00:26:12,057
Depends on what l'm doing
when you call.

567
00:26:12,132 --> 00:26:13,997
Well, you wait here,
and l'll interview you.

568
00:26:14,067 --> 00:26:16,035
Hey, Rick, can l see you
out here for a minute?

569
00:26:16,103 --> 00:26:17,764
Don't go away, girls.

570
00:26:19,339 --> 00:26:21,000
Look, you can
let them all go.

571
00:26:21,074 --> 00:26:22,632
l've hired
the perfect girl.

572
00:26:22,709 --> 00:26:24,267
She can type,
take shorthand

573
00:26:24,344 --> 00:26:25,606
and knows the islands.

574
00:26:25,679 --> 00:26:28,944
Huh... We met before,
about two years ago.

575
00:26:29,016 --> 00:26:30,449
On a surfboard.

576
00:26:30,517 --> 00:26:31,609
Really?

577
00:26:31,685 --> 00:26:32,777
Yeah, Waikiki.

578
00:26:32,853 --> 00:26:34,218
You were wiped out.

579
00:26:34,288 --> 00:26:36,119
Remember? l scooped you
out of the soup.

580
00:26:36,190 --> 00:26:37,623
Oh, yeah, l remember.

581
00:26:37,691 --> 00:26:39,852
You tried to give me
mouth-to-mouth resuscitation.

582
00:26:39,927 --> 00:26:40,894
The offer still holds.

583
00:26:40,961 --> 00:26:42,121
Hmm, l'll keep it in mind.

584
00:26:42,196 --> 00:26:43,458
You never gave me your name.

585
00:26:43,530 --> 00:26:44,462
Judy...

586
00:26:44,531 --> 00:26:45,623
Uh, Mrs. Hudson.

587
00:26:45,699 --> 00:26:46,631
Oh. Mrs. Rock Hudson?

588
00:26:46,700 --> 00:26:47,758
Uh, Mrs. Roy Hudson.

589
00:26:47,835 --> 00:26:49,530
Julie's husband's a Navy pilot.

590
00:26:49,603 --> 00:26:50,797
He's out on maneuvers.

591
00:26:50,871 --> 00:26:53,032
Oh. Do you mind
if l call you ''Friday''?

592
00:26:53,106 --> 00:26:55,131
Uh, Judy reminds me
of a clam shucker.

593
00:26:55,275 --> 00:26:56,264
A clam shucker?

594
00:26:56,343 --> 00:26:57,742
Yeah, it's this girl
l used to know.

595
00:26:57,811 --> 00:26:59,676
lt was her favorite pastime--
shucking clams.

596
00:26:59,746 --> 00:27:00,906
Would you excuse us, please?

597
00:27:00,981 --> 00:27:02,278
Danny?

598
00:27:04,985 --> 00:27:06,418
Why pick a married one?

599
00:27:06,486 --> 00:27:08,249
So you'd keep your mind
on your work.

600
00:27:08,322 --> 00:27:09,687
Ah, you worry too much, Danny.

601
00:27:09,756 --> 00:27:11,724
l'm off to forge another link
in the Danrick operation.

602
00:27:11,792 --> 00:27:13,589
There's a girl at the
Polynesian Culture Center...

603
00:27:13,660 --> 00:27:14,649
Oh, not another one.

604
00:27:14,728 --> 00:27:16,525
Look, we've got enough gals
working for us now

605
00:27:16,597 --> 00:27:17,655
to start a modeling agency.

606
00:27:17,731 --> 00:27:19,255
The more girls,
the more business.

607
00:27:19,333 --> 00:27:21,324
l promise l won't get
emotionally involved.

608
00:27:21,401 --> 00:27:23,096
Take the other girls inside,
will you?

609
00:27:23,170 --> 00:27:26,139
And get their numbers
while you're at it.

610
00:27:31,345 --> 00:27:34,007
l'll buy one of my own
at the dime store.

611
00:27:34,081 --> 00:27:36,106
Sometimes saying you're married

612
00:27:36,183 --> 00:27:38,811
works better than
an insect repellent.

613
00:29:26,994 --> 00:29:28,518
Hi, Rick.

614
00:29:28,595 --> 00:29:29,857
Hi.

615
00:29:29,930 --> 00:29:33,093
Please excuse me.

616
00:29:33,200 --> 00:29:35,225
Rick, aloha noe!

617
00:29:35,302 --> 00:29:36,769
Pua, it's been a long time.

618
00:29:36,837 --> 00:29:37,963
Too long. l've missed you.

619
00:29:38,038 --> 00:29:39,528
Where did you get
the helicopter?

620
00:29:39,606 --> 00:29:41,767
l've just gone into business
with Danny Kohana.

621
00:29:41,842 --> 00:29:43,503
Then you're going
to stay on the islands?

622
00:29:43,577 --> 00:29:45,067
Once l get
the helicopter service going

623
00:29:45,145 --> 00:29:46,442
l can spend
most of my time here.

624
00:29:46,513 --> 00:29:47,775
Oh, l'm for that!
Can l help?

625
00:29:47,848 --> 00:29:49,281
Like nobody else can.

626
00:29:49,349 --> 00:29:51,442
You scratch my back,
and l'll scratch yours.

627
00:29:51,518 --> 00:29:52,951
Sounds good.

628
00:29:53,020 --> 00:29:54,783
Oh, but right now l've
got to ride on a canoe.

629
00:29:54,855 --> 00:29:55,947
lt's part of the show.

630
00:29:56,023 --> 00:29:56,955
Do you want to come along?

631
00:29:57,024 --> 00:29:57,956
Great! Let's go!

632
00:29:58,025 --> 00:29:59,151
Okay.

633
00:30:54,781 --> 00:31:00,845
Drums of the islands,
you're beating in my heart

634
00:31:00,921 --> 00:31:06,826
You're with me
no matter where l roam

635
00:31:06,893 --> 00:31:14,129
lf ever l wander,
if ever we're apart

636
00:31:14,201 --> 00:31:18,638
l know that
you will lead me home

637
00:31:18,705 --> 00:31:25,304
lf l should journey
across the deep blue sea

638
00:31:25,378 --> 00:31:31,146
l'll never forget
these coral shores

639
00:31:31,218 --> 00:31:38,488
Drums of the islands,
l hear you calling me

640
00:31:38,558 --> 00:31:44,155
And l'll return
forever yours

641
00:31:44,297 --> 00:31:50,497
l love each valley,
each grain of sand, each hill

642
00:31:50,570 --> 00:31:56,167
The flowers,
the music of the isles

643
00:31:56,243 --> 00:32:03,115
These are the things
that l love and always will

644
00:32:03,183 --> 00:32:08,849
Though l may roam
10,000 miles

645
00:32:08,922 --> 00:32:14,883
Drums of the islands,
you're beating in my heart

646
00:32:14,961 --> 00:32:20,957
You're with me
no matter where l roam

647
00:32:21,034 --> 00:32:27,462
lf ever l wander,
if ever we're apart

648
00:32:27,541 --> 00:32:33,309
l know that
you will lead me home

649
00:32:55,902 --> 00:33:02,603
l love each valley,
each grain of sand, each hill

650
00:33:02,676 --> 00:33:08,808
The flowers,
the music of the isles

651
00:33:08,882 --> 00:33:15,617
These are the things
that l love and always will

652
00:33:15,689 --> 00:33:18,021
Though l may roam
10,000 miles

653
00:33:22,362 --> 00:33:29,461
Drums of the islands,
you're beating in my heart

654
00:33:29,536 --> 00:33:34,473
You're with me
no matter where l roam

655
00:33:34,541 --> 00:33:41,470
lf ever l wander,
if ever we're apart

656
00:33:41,548 --> 00:33:47,851
l know that you
will lead me home.

657
00:33:55,895 --> 00:33:58,659
Danrick Airways.

658
00:33:58,732 --> 00:34:02,259
l'm sorry,
he's not here right now.

659
00:34:02,335 --> 00:34:04,803
Yes, l will.

660
00:34:06,172 --> 00:34:07,935
Oh, how's it going?

661
00:34:08,008 --> 00:34:09,270
Danny was looking
for you.

662
00:34:09,342 --> 00:34:10,934
He had to leave
with a customer.

663
00:34:11,011 --> 00:34:12,103
What's up?

664
00:34:12,178 --> 00:34:13,941
You've got a date
with some dogs.

665
00:34:14,014 --> 00:34:15,606
Oh, a change of pace, eh?

666
00:34:15,682 --> 00:34:17,117
l meant real ones.

667
00:34:17,183 --> 00:34:19,481
A Mrs. Daisy Barrington
chartered our service

668
00:34:19,552 --> 00:34:21,611
to take her pets to a dog show
in Kauai.

669
00:34:21,688 --> 00:34:23,622
Nobody else would take them
uncrated.

670
00:34:23,690 --> 00:34:25,885
She'll meet you
at the country club.

671
00:34:25,959 --> 00:34:27,119
We don't haul dogs.

672
00:34:27,227 --> 00:34:29,354
She's willing to pay
a great deal.

673
00:34:29,429 --> 00:34:31,454
Oh. We do haul dogs.

674
00:34:31,531 --> 00:34:33,226
Uh, where are they?

675
00:34:33,300 --> 00:34:35,632
You're to pick them up
at the Kahala Hilton.

676
00:34:35,702 --> 00:34:36,896
Like right now.

677
00:34:36,970 --> 00:34:38,130
The Kahala Hilton.

678
00:34:38,204 --> 00:34:40,104
That reminds me,
l know a girl who works there.

679
00:34:40,173 --> 00:34:41,140
Might be able to help us.

680
00:34:41,274 --> 00:34:43,071
Another clam shucker?

681
00:34:43,143 --> 00:34:44,633
Very funny.

682
00:34:44,711 --> 00:34:47,145
Oh, uh, by the way,
how do you like the job?

683
00:34:47,247 --> 00:34:49,147
l'd rather be doing
what you're doing.

684
00:34:49,215 --> 00:34:50,807
l don't think
you could take the strain.

685
00:34:50,884 --> 00:34:51,816
Good-bye.

686
00:34:51,885 --> 00:34:54,012
Bye.

687
00:35:30,690 --> 00:35:32,783
Mm. l sure like the way
you working girls don't dress.

688
00:35:32,859 --> 00:35:36,454
lt's my day off
and l can dress any way l like.

689
00:35:36,529 --> 00:35:38,394
Are those your dogs?

690
00:35:41,401 --> 00:35:43,995
Well, it's time
for you to go to work.

691
00:35:44,070 --> 00:35:46,334
Hmm. What a way
to earn a living.

692
00:35:46,406 --> 00:35:48,567
lt's nice of you
to come along, Joanna.

693
00:35:48,641 --> 00:35:50,336
l want to see
what l'm selling.

694
00:35:52,879 --> 00:35:54,312
Thank you.

695
00:35:54,381 --> 00:35:57,009
We'll get them there all right.

696
00:36:21,040 --> 00:36:27,206
lf l had my life to live over,
l know just what l'd like to be

697
00:36:27,280 --> 00:36:30,772
A pampered pet
of a rich brunette

698
00:36:30,850 --> 00:36:34,115
Sittin' on my mama's knee

699
00:36:34,254 --> 00:36:37,280
Someone to love me,
someone to care

700
00:36:37,357 --> 00:36:40,793
Rubba-dubba-dub her little
fingers through my hair

701
00:36:40,860 --> 00:36:43,124
l need a dog's life

702
00:36:43,196 --> 00:36:44,390
What a life

703
00:36:44,464 --> 00:36:47,627
That's good enough for me

704
00:36:47,700 --> 00:36:51,534
That's good enough
for me

705
00:36:57,811 --> 00:37:00,644
lf l had a bone to be pickin'

706
00:37:00,713 --> 00:37:03,910
A pickin' chicken or a steak

707
00:37:03,983 --> 00:37:07,419
Curled up there in an easy chair

708
00:37:07,487 --> 00:37:10,752
Man, that won't be hard to take

709
00:37:10,824 --> 00:37:12,587
l'll always be faithful

710
00:37:12,659 --> 00:37:14,251
That's what l'd be

711
00:37:14,327 --> 00:37:16,921
Never bite the hand
that feeds me, no, sirree

712
00:37:16,996 --> 00:37:19,260
Just lead a dog's life

713
00:37:19,332 --> 00:37:20,765
What a life

714
00:37:20,834 --> 00:37:23,928
That's good enough for me

715
00:37:24,003 --> 00:37:28,030
That's good enough
for me

716
00:37:34,247 --> 00:37:37,614
l'd find me a fifi le poodle

717
00:37:37,684 --> 00:37:40,278
And lose my noodle over her

718
00:37:40,353 --> 00:37:42,253
l'd chase her around

719
00:37:42,322 --> 00:37:44,119
All over town

720
00:37:44,190 --> 00:37:47,455
Just to ruffle up her fur

721
00:37:47,527 --> 00:37:50,621
Nuzzle her muzzle,
a hole in her paw

722
00:37:50,697 --> 00:37:52,961
Greatest case of puppy lovin'
you ever saw

723
00:37:53,032 --> 00:37:55,125
lt's called a dog's life

724
00:37:55,201 --> 00:37:57,931
What a life

725
00:37:58,004 --> 00:37:59,130
That's good enough for me

726
00:37:59,272 --> 00:38:00,796
You heard me say it now

727
00:38:00,874 --> 00:38:03,399
That's good enough for me

728
00:38:03,476 --> 00:38:05,569
Yeah.

729
00:38:07,814 --> 00:38:10,078
That's good enough for me.

730
00:38:14,621 --> 00:38:17,249
Ah, behave yourself.

731
00:38:19,659 --> 00:38:21,058
This evening had better be worth

732
00:38:21,127 --> 00:38:22,594
what l'm going through
back here.

733
00:38:22,662 --> 00:38:24,789
l'll buy you the biggest
steak you ever had.

734
00:38:25,899 --> 00:38:30,336
Okay, all right,
you cats, cool it!

735
00:38:31,204 --> 00:38:33,764
Hey, l'm your friend.

736
00:38:33,840 --> 00:38:36,741
They must be hungry.

737
00:38:42,348 --> 00:38:46,580
Behave yourself.

738
00:38:47,554 --> 00:38:52,287
Ow! You don't eat out much,
do you?

739
00:38:52,358 --> 00:38:56,954
Here. You take them and see
if you can calm them down.

740
00:38:57,030 --> 00:38:58,429
Hey!

741
00:39:01,467 --> 00:39:02,957
Hey!

742
00:39:03,036 --> 00:39:06,096
Hey, get them off me!
Help me!

743
00:39:07,840 --> 00:39:09,171
Help!

744
00:39:09,242 --> 00:39:10,766
Down, boy.

745
00:39:10,843 --> 00:39:12,140
Down, l said. Not up!

746
00:39:17,750 --> 00:39:19,183
Rick!

747
00:39:22,956 --> 00:39:25,083
Rick!

748
00:39:27,393 --> 00:39:28,451
Hey!

749
00:39:30,863 --> 00:39:33,354
He's blocking my view.

750
00:39:33,433 --> 00:39:35,401
Get him off my lap!

751
00:39:42,108 --> 00:39:43,575
Rick, watch what you're doing!

752
00:39:43,643 --> 00:39:44,803
Joanna, hold him back.

753
00:40:05,898 --> 00:40:08,128
Hey, you want to fly it?

754
00:40:08,234 --> 00:40:10,395
l can't see! Rick!

755
00:40:21,781 --> 00:40:23,043
Yeah, l see it!

756
00:40:23,116 --> 00:40:24,048
Help!

757
00:40:36,129 --> 00:40:37,858
Oh, my God, help!

758
00:40:37,930 --> 00:40:40,364
Rick, Rick, Rick, stop!

759
00:41:02,088 --> 00:41:03,953
Rick, the car!

760
00:41:04,023 --> 00:41:05,320
Donald!

761
00:41:16,235 --> 00:41:17,964
You, you, you...
road hog!

762
00:41:18,037 --> 00:41:21,268
There ought to be a law
against such an outrage!

763
00:41:21,340 --> 00:41:22,773
l got his number.

764
00:41:25,244 --> 00:41:27,405
This is the day, Ruggles.

765
00:41:27,480 --> 00:41:31,314
The is the big day
we've been waiting for.

766
00:41:31,384 --> 00:41:34,353
At last, at last.

767
00:41:34,420 --> 00:41:37,856
lt's their first flight
without me.

768
00:41:37,924 --> 00:41:40,654
They're growing up.

769
00:41:51,104 --> 00:41:53,834
Oh, Ruggles, l hope to heaven

770
00:41:53,906 --> 00:41:57,205
my little ones
didn't get airsick.

771
00:42:04,517 --> 00:42:07,315
My babies.

772
00:42:07,386 --> 00:42:08,819
My babies.

773
00:42:08,888 --> 00:42:10,355
My babies!

774
00:42:10,423 --> 00:42:13,688
What have they done to you?!

775
00:42:15,261 --> 00:42:18,025
Look at them.
Just look at them.

776
00:42:18,097 --> 00:42:20,224
How can l ever show them?!

777
00:42:20,299 --> 00:42:23,666
What have you done
to my precious babies?!

778
00:42:23,736 --> 00:42:25,067
Well, look what
they've done to me.

779
00:42:25,138 --> 00:42:26,070
Shh-shh!

780
00:42:26,139 --> 00:42:27,504
Well, they're just fine, ma'am.

781
00:42:27,573 --> 00:42:29,632
See, we had a little party
on the way over...

782
00:42:29,709 --> 00:42:30,835
with dancing and music...

783
00:42:30,910 --> 00:42:32,036
and doggie yum-yums.

784
00:42:32,111 --> 00:42:36,138
You fed them dog food?

785
00:42:36,282 --> 00:42:39,683
How dare...!

786
00:42:39,752 --> 00:42:42,550
Oh...

787
00:42:42,622 --> 00:42:47,150
did that naughty man hurt
Mommy's little sweethearts?

788
00:42:47,293 --> 00:42:49,761
Oh, well,
you come on with Mommy.

789
00:42:49,829 --> 00:42:51,626
Mommy take care of you.

790
00:42:51,697 --> 00:42:53,528
Come on, Ruggles.

791
00:42:53,599 --> 00:42:54,566
Come on, baby.

792
00:42:54,634 --> 00:42:56,602
Mommy take care of you.

793
00:42:58,404 --> 00:43:01,305
l look a lot worse
than they do.

794
00:43:01,374 --> 00:43:02,966
Yeah. How am l
going to show you?

795
00:43:03,042 --> 00:43:05,840
By paying for a new hairdo.

796
00:43:05,912 --> 00:43:08,107
And that steak you promised.

797
00:43:21,594 --> 00:43:23,585
Stop it, Andy.

798
00:43:24,797 --> 00:43:26,765
Behave yourself.

799
00:43:28,601 --> 00:43:30,660
You're making me
lose my appetite.

800
00:43:30,736 --> 00:43:32,636
Oh, well, l'm improving mine.

801
00:43:32,705 --> 00:43:35,902
l was told you were shy
and retiring.

802
00:43:35,975 --> 00:43:38,273
You must have been talking
to my mother.

803
00:43:41,848 --> 00:43:42,974
l'm starved.

804
00:43:43,049 --> 00:43:45,381
All l've had all day were
those doggie yum-yums.

805
00:43:45,451 --> 00:43:46,884
My hairdresser almost gave up.

806
00:43:46,953 --> 00:43:49,319
She thought l should be
declared a disaster area.

807
00:43:49,388 --> 00:43:50,548
l don't know about that.

808
00:43:50,623 --> 00:43:52,250
Stop it!

809
00:43:54,994 --> 00:43:56,894
l'll have a thick slice

810
00:43:56,963 --> 00:43:58,294
of that one.

811
00:44:01,167 --> 00:44:04,603
Uh, new rules: no dogs,
alligators or cats.

812
00:44:04,670 --> 00:44:06,638
Just give us two fillets.

813
00:44:07,740 --> 00:44:09,401
You, uh, lose
your wedding ring?

814
00:44:09,475 --> 00:44:11,500
Oh, l always take it off
when l bathe.

815
00:44:11,577 --> 00:44:13,204
Oh, you've taken a bath.

816
00:44:13,279 --> 00:44:16,442
Uh, Joanna, this is my
secretary, Mrs. Hudson.

817
00:44:16,515 --> 00:44:17,447
Oh, hello.

818
00:44:17,516 --> 00:44:18,881
Hi. Well, it's
been nice seeing you.

819
00:44:18,951 --> 00:44:20,213
Come on, Andy.
The table's ready.

820
00:44:20,286 --> 00:44:21,446
l haven't ordered
my steak yet.

821
00:44:21,520 --> 00:44:22,987
l've ordered enough
for two-- come on!

822
00:44:23,055 --> 00:44:25,216
Oh, l didn't know your husband
was back from maneuvers.

823
00:44:25,291 --> 00:44:26,849
Rick Richards.

824
00:44:26,926 --> 00:44:28,621
Give me a big hunk
of that, mac.

825
00:44:28,694 --> 00:44:30,218
Husband?!

826
00:44:30,296 --> 00:44:32,230
Uh, well, this isn't my husband.

827
00:44:32,298 --> 00:44:34,391
He's a friend--
a friend of ours.

828
00:44:34,467 --> 00:44:36,833
Baby, l didn't know
you were married.

829
00:44:36,903 --> 00:44:38,268
l'm sorry, l've done
a terrible thing

830
00:44:38,337 --> 00:44:39,634
and l can understand
you hating me.

831
00:44:39,705 --> 00:44:41,138
But l don't hate you.

832
00:44:41,274 --> 00:44:42,673
l think it's great.

833
00:44:42,742 --> 00:44:44,141
Stop it.
l told you, l'm married.

834
00:44:44,277 --> 00:44:45,244
Yeah, l know.

835
00:44:45,311 --> 00:44:46,676
Maybe you better cool it, huh?

836
00:44:46,746 --> 00:44:48,577
Hey, why don't you stick

837
00:44:48,648 --> 00:44:51,481
that big nose somewhere else,
buster?

838
00:44:51,550 --> 00:44:52,517
Cut it out.

839
00:44:52,585 --> 00:44:54,553
Just chalk it off to experience.

840
00:44:54,620 --> 00:44:58,317
Now, look, l ain't leaving
until l get my steak.

841
00:45:00,426 --> 00:45:01,825
Baby, we could
have a good time...

842
00:45:01,894 --> 00:45:03,020
Here's your steak... rare!

843
00:45:10,937 --> 00:45:11,961
One of those, huh?

844
00:45:12,038 --> 00:45:14,063
That's my boy.
Dust him off, Rusty.

845
00:45:18,177 --> 00:45:20,168
Duck, Rick!

846
00:45:24,150 --> 00:45:27,847
You... you...!

847
00:45:27,920 --> 00:45:28,887
Joanna!

848
00:45:36,896 --> 00:45:39,023
Get me out of here.

849
00:45:39,098 --> 00:45:41,396
Would you like your steaks
put in a doggie bag, sir?

850
00:45:41,467 --> 00:45:42,456
A doggie bag!

851
00:45:42,535 --> 00:45:44,127
After what l've been through?

852
00:45:52,611 --> 00:45:55,808
You're quite a girl, Friday:
surfer, pilot, secretary, wife.

853
00:45:55,881 --> 00:45:57,815
Well, yes, sometimes
l amaze myself.

854
00:45:57,883 --> 00:45:59,441
l'll see you in the morning?

855
00:45:59,518 --> 00:46:00,450
Why not?

856
00:46:00,519 --> 00:46:02,180
l haven't been fired, have l?

857
00:46:02,254 --> 00:46:04,245
No, your personal life's
your own.

858
00:46:04,323 --> 00:46:06,314
l'm sorry l got involved in it
tonight.

859
00:46:06,392 --> 00:46:07,654
You can let me off here.

860
00:46:07,727 --> 00:46:09,024
lt's only another block.

861
00:46:14,734 --> 00:46:17,532
For the same fare, l could
take you all the way.

862
00:46:24,043 --> 00:46:25,067
Good night, Rick.

863
00:46:25,144 --> 00:46:27,635
Uh, maybe l better go
and explain to your husband

864
00:46:27,713 --> 00:46:29,044
that you had to work late.

865
00:46:29,115 --> 00:46:30,309
Uh, no, thanks.

866
00:46:30,383 --> 00:46:32,476
And that you'll be leaving early
on a special assignment.

867
00:46:32,551 --> 00:46:33,643
-For the company?
-Of course.

868
00:46:33,719 --> 00:46:35,346
But maybe it's better
if l tell him about it.

869
00:46:35,421 --> 00:46:37,412
No, he wouldn't understand.
He's very jealous.

870
00:46:37,490 --> 00:46:38,957
Well, that didn't
bother you earlier.

871
00:46:39,025 --> 00:46:41,391
Which makes me just the kind
of girl you like, doesn't it?

872
00:46:41,460 --> 00:46:43,087
Good night.

873
00:47:10,022 --> 00:47:12,752
Aw, come on,
you can't be that angry.

874
00:47:12,825 --> 00:47:14,087
Can't l?

875
00:47:14,193 --> 00:47:16,286
l was afraid you might not
show up this morning

876
00:47:16,362 --> 00:47:17,294
but l'm glad you did.

877
00:47:17,363 --> 00:47:18,455
Thank you.

878
00:47:20,266 --> 00:47:23,099
There's still something wrong.

879
00:47:28,274 --> 00:47:29,502
That bugs you, doesn't it?

880
00:47:29,575 --> 00:47:30,940
No, it's just good business.

881
00:47:31,010 --> 00:47:32,602
A single girl sells
more tickets.

882
00:47:32,678 --> 00:47:34,703
l'll keep it.

883
00:47:34,780 --> 00:47:35,838
Where?

884
00:47:38,284 --> 00:47:41,515
lt's a good thing you weren't
wearing a charm bracelet.

885
00:47:45,825 --> 00:47:47,087
That's it.

886
00:47:47,159 --> 00:47:48,183
Hold it.

887
00:47:55,501 --> 00:47:57,332
B-But, Mr. Belden

888
00:47:57,403 --> 00:48:00,133
are you sure it was
one of our helicopters?

889
00:48:00,272 --> 00:48:01,864
Yes, yes, that's right.

890
00:48:01,941 --> 00:48:02,908
Not now, Jan.

891
00:48:02,975 --> 00:48:04,704
Friday?

892
00:48:04,777 --> 00:48:07,473
He did what?!

893
00:48:07,546 --> 00:48:09,741
Mr. Belden, why would
anyone be driving down

894
00:48:09,815 --> 00:48:12,585
either side of the highway,
let alone the wrong side?

895
00:48:12,651 --> 00:48:14,175
Look, Kohana, l'm accustomed

896
00:48:14,253 --> 00:48:16,346
to handling complaints
filed by others

897
00:48:16,422 --> 00:48:19,414
and l hate to make more work
for myself and the board

898
00:48:19,492 --> 00:48:22,950
but l can not ignore reckless
flying and the near-destruction

899
00:48:23,028 --> 00:48:26,020
of government property in the
form of my assigned automobile

900
00:48:26,098 --> 00:48:27,497
not to mention my wife.

901
00:48:27,566 --> 00:48:29,500
Your wife?
l hope it wasn't serious.

902
00:48:29,568 --> 00:48:31,536
What happened?

903
00:48:32,371 --> 00:48:34,100
Oh, hi, Uncle Rick!

904
00:48:34,240 --> 00:48:35,366
Oh, hi, Jan.

905
00:48:35,441 --> 00:48:38,103
l guess l'm getting too old
for that stuff.

906
00:48:38,210 --> 00:48:40,303
No, you got a long way to go,
Jan.

907
00:48:40,379 --> 00:48:41,903
What are you doing here?

908
00:48:41,981 --> 00:48:44,245
Daddy promised me
a ride in his helicopter!

909
00:48:44,316 --> 00:48:45,647
Shh...

910
00:48:45,718 --> 00:48:47,208
And then we're going for a swim.

911
00:48:47,286 --> 00:48:48,548
Hmm.

912
00:48:48,621 --> 00:48:52,057
Now there's no point in making
a federal case out of it

913
00:48:52,124 --> 00:48:54,422
as long as no one
was seriously hurt.

914
00:48:54,493 --> 00:48:55,425
Yes, sir.

915
00:48:55,494 --> 00:48:56,688
Yes, sir, l'll come right over

916
00:48:56,762 --> 00:48:58,320
and see if we can't straighten
it out.

917
00:48:58,397 --> 00:48:59,489
Yes, sir, right away.

918
00:49:01,233 --> 00:49:02,791
Do you know who that was?

919
00:49:02,868 --> 00:49:03,800
Surprise me.

920
00:49:03,869 --> 00:49:05,063
Donald Belden.

921
00:49:05,137 --> 00:49:08,197
One of the regional directors
of the lsland Aviation Bureau.

922
00:49:08,274 --> 00:49:09,434
Where does he want us
to fly him?

923
00:49:09,508 --> 00:49:11,408
He's already been given
a short trip--

924
00:49:11,477 --> 00:49:13,069
right into an irrigation ditch.

925
00:49:13,212 --> 00:49:15,874
You forced him off the highway
with the chopper.

926
00:49:15,948 --> 00:49:16,915
l what?!

927
00:49:16,982 --> 00:49:18,677
He says his wife
will never be the same.

928
00:49:18,751 --> 00:49:20,548
Are you sure he doesn't
want to thank me?

929
00:49:20,619 --> 00:49:22,348
Oh, come on.
This is no time for jokes.

930
00:49:22,421 --> 00:49:24,389
l've got to go right over
and calm him down

931
00:49:24,456 --> 00:49:26,048
before he files
a formal complaint.

932
00:49:26,125 --> 00:49:27,353
Look, Danny,
l didn't even see him.

933
00:49:27,426 --> 00:49:29,018
lt must've happened
when the dogs got loose.

934
00:49:29,094 --> 00:49:30,925
You really set
some kind of a new record.

935
00:49:30,996 --> 00:49:32,088
ln addition to Belden

936
00:49:32,198 --> 00:49:33,961
we've had complaints
from Mrs. Barrington

937
00:49:34,033 --> 00:49:36,092
the Steak House and the
Pineapple Pickers Union.

938
00:49:36,235 --> 00:49:37,099
Oh, boy.

939
00:49:37,236 --> 00:49:38,794
Good news travels fast,
doesn't it?

940
00:49:38,871 --> 00:49:40,429
l'll see you all later.

941
00:49:40,506 --> 00:49:43,202
l got to go bail us out,
one at a time.

942
00:49:43,275 --> 00:49:45,766
But Dad, you said you were going
to go take me for a ride.

943
00:49:45,844 --> 00:49:47,471
l did it, Danny.
l'll clear it up.

944
00:49:47,546 --> 00:49:48,570
Let me talk to Belden.

945
00:49:48,647 --> 00:49:51,741
No chance.
You couldn't get near him.

946
00:49:51,817 --> 00:49:54,752
l'm sorry, sweetheart.
Maybe later.

947
00:49:54,820 --> 00:49:58,221
You keep an eye on her
until l get back.

948
00:50:02,127 --> 00:50:04,220
Come on, honey, l'll teach you
how to type your name.

949
00:50:04,296 --> 00:50:06,696
l already know that.

950
00:50:06,765 --> 00:50:08,255
Oh, you had
two calls.

951
00:50:08,334 --> 00:50:09,801
Business or pleasure?

952
00:50:09,868 --> 00:50:12,359
l'm beginning to wonder
if there's a difference.

953
00:50:12,438 --> 00:50:14,133
Uh, Joanna wants you to call her

954
00:50:14,206 --> 00:50:16,265
and Lani has a honeymoon couple
on Kauai

955
00:50:16,342 --> 00:50:18,572
who want to come back here
to the airport.

956
00:50:21,313 --> 00:50:22,302
Cheer up, Jan.

957
00:50:22,381 --> 00:50:23,780
He'll be back soon.

958
00:50:23,849 --> 00:50:26,716
Why do grownups always think
business is so important?

959
00:50:26,785 --> 00:50:28,844
Nothing is more important
than you are.

960
00:50:28,921 --> 00:50:30,889
Your daddy just has
to straighten out

961
00:50:30,956 --> 00:50:32,651
a mess l got us into.

962
00:50:32,725 --> 00:50:33,953
Now what if l take you up?

963
00:50:34,026 --> 00:50:34,958
Would you, Uncle Rick?

964
00:50:35,027 --> 00:50:35,959
Why not?

965
00:50:36,028 --> 00:50:37,120
Right near the hotel on Kauai

966
00:50:37,196 --> 00:50:38,458
is a place
called the lron Kettle

967
00:50:38,530 --> 00:50:40,122
where they have
the most beautiful beach

968
00:50:40,199 --> 00:50:42,326
and they build the biggest
sand castles you ever saw.

969
00:50:42,401 --> 00:50:43,333
How about it?

970
00:50:43,402 --> 00:50:44,494
That sounds great.
Let's go.

971
00:50:44,570 --> 00:50:46,265
That's nice of you,
but you think you should?

972
00:50:46,338 --> 00:50:47,999
Sure, why not?
We'll have lunch at Hanalei

973
00:50:48,073 --> 00:50:49,904
and then bring the passengers
back after that.

974
00:50:49,975 --> 00:50:51,101
lt'll be like a real date!

975
00:50:51,176 --> 00:50:53,235
Hmm... my life gets
more and more complicated.

976
00:50:55,514 --> 00:50:57,448
Let's go.

977
00:50:57,516 --> 00:51:00,178
And remember:
no dogs, alligators or cats.

978
00:51:00,252 --> 00:51:02,117
And you keep off
the highways.

979
00:51:02,187 --> 00:51:03,154
Bye, Friday!

980
00:51:20,239 --> 00:51:22,264
Fun, huh?

981
00:51:22,341 --> 00:51:24,002
lt's like being inside
a big glass bug.

982
00:51:24,076 --> 00:51:26,636
l'll teach you how to fly
this bug when you're old enough.

983
00:51:26,712 --> 00:51:27,906
Do you really think l could?

984
00:51:27,980 --> 00:51:29,140
Sure, there's nothing to it.

985
00:51:29,248 --> 00:51:31,443
All you have to do is
learn how to pat your head

986
00:51:31,517 --> 00:51:33,280
and rub your stomach
at the same time.

987
00:51:35,120 --> 00:51:36,246
That's great.

988
00:51:36,322 --> 00:51:38,654
Now try blinking one eye.

989
00:51:38,724 --> 00:51:41,124
Now stick out your tongue.

990
00:51:41,193 --> 00:51:43,161
Oh, that's just being silly.

991
00:51:43,295 --> 00:51:45,593
Well, that's what dates are for.

992
00:51:50,736 --> 00:51:54,866
Datin' is a game
that grown-ups play

993
00:51:54,940 --> 00:51:58,376
Datin' means actin'
in a silly way

994
00:51:58,444 --> 00:52:02,278
Datin' makes the gals
start wiggle walkin'

995
00:52:02,348 --> 00:52:06,011
Datin' makes a guy
start baby-talkin'

996
00:52:06,085 --> 00:52:09,714
Dizzy like children
on a merry-go-round

997
00:52:09,788 --> 00:52:13,588
Grown-ups are the biggest
kids l've found

998
00:52:13,659 --> 00:52:17,322
You'd think they'd belong
in a baby carriage

999
00:52:17,396 --> 00:52:21,264
They're doin' things
that lead to marriage

1000
00:52:21,333 --> 00:52:23,767
Now, don't you laugh
at what they do, oh, no

1001
00:52:23,836 --> 00:52:28,739
'Cause someday
you'll be datin', too

1002
00:52:28,807 --> 00:52:31,799
Datin' makes a guy
comb his hair just right

1003
00:52:31,877 --> 00:52:36,439
So his gal can mess it up
when they kiss good night

1004
00:52:36,515 --> 00:52:40,417
Datin' makes you quarrel
and say you'll break up

1005
00:52:40,486 --> 00:52:44,286
Just because it's so much fun to
make up

1006
00:52:44,356 --> 00:52:47,757
Children can't wait
to grow up, but then...

1007
00:52:47,826 --> 00:52:51,694
They're datin' and they're
actin' like kids again

1008
00:52:51,764 --> 00:52:55,564
You'd think they'd belong
in a baby carriage

1009
00:52:55,634 --> 00:52:59,536
But they're doin' things
that lead to marriage

1010
00:52:59,605 --> 00:53:02,938
Now, don't you laugh
at what they do, oh, no

1011
00:53:03,008 --> 00:53:07,411
Someday you'll be datin' too

1012
00:53:44,750 --> 00:53:46,718
Oh, boy! Sandcastles!

1013
00:53:51,490 --> 00:53:52,422
Welcome, Rick.

1014
00:53:52,491 --> 00:53:53,423
Thank you.

1015
00:53:53,492 --> 00:53:55,050
You've come back
to marry my daughter?

1016
00:53:55,127 --> 00:53:56,059
Papa, please.

1017
00:53:56,128 --> 00:53:57,095
She has royal blood.

1018
00:53:57,162 --> 00:53:58,151
On her mother's side?

1019
00:53:58,297 --> 00:53:59,855
My ancestors
had the right idea.

1020
00:53:59,932 --> 00:54:02,423
lf a young man didn't want
to marry your daughter

1021
00:54:02,501 --> 00:54:05,561
you dipped him in coconut butter
and threw him into a volcano.

1022
00:54:05,637 --> 00:54:07,229
ln coconut butter?

1023
00:54:07,306 --> 00:54:08,898
They use it on everything.

1024
00:54:08,974 --> 00:54:10,407
You think it over, Rick.

1025
00:54:10,476 --> 00:54:12,376
l got some other cooking to do.

1026
00:54:12,444 --> 00:54:14,969
Well, uh, l better
get back to the hotel.

1027
00:54:15,047 --> 00:54:17,038
The honeymooners
will be waiting.

1028
00:54:17,115 --> 00:54:19,276
Oh, they won't be ready
until 4:00.

1029
00:54:19,351 --> 00:54:21,410
4:00? That's five hours
from now.

1030
00:54:21,487 --> 00:54:23,717
Wasn't that the point
to our deal--

1031
00:54:23,789 --> 00:54:25,814
to spend
a little time together?

1032
00:54:25,891 --> 00:54:27,256
l've got Jan with me.

1033
00:54:27,326 --> 00:54:29,123
You can have her back
before dark.

1034
00:54:29,228 --> 00:54:32,391
We'll leave her here with Papa
and go to Moonlight Beach.

1035
00:54:32,464 --> 00:54:33,522
No deal.

1036
00:54:33,599 --> 00:54:34,623
l can't leave Jan.

1037
00:54:34,700 --> 00:54:36,725
l promised not to let
her out of my sight.

1038
00:54:36,802 --> 00:54:38,565
All right,
but it won't be the same.

1039
00:54:38,637 --> 00:54:41,401
l'll get my swimsuit
and meet you at the 'copter...

1040
00:54:41,473 --> 00:54:43,100
with three lunches.

1041
00:54:45,244 --> 00:54:47,439
Uncle Rick!

1042
00:54:48,714 --> 00:54:52,241
Uncle Rick, come help us
build a sand castle.

1043
00:54:52,317 --> 00:54:58,449
A house of sand
is an empty work of art

1044
00:55:00,492 --> 00:55:03,791
Oh, you can take
a whole lot of sand

1045
00:55:03,862 --> 00:55:06,498
And build a castle on the beach

1046
00:55:06,565 --> 00:55:10,331
And though you mold it,
and you plan

1047
00:55:10,402 --> 00:55:13,098
Still you've got nothing
in your reach

1048
00:55:13,171 --> 00:55:16,698
One little slip
and it tumbles down

1049
00:55:16,775 --> 00:55:20,233
One wrong step
and it crumbles all around

1050
00:55:20,312 --> 00:55:24,772
Like a house without love
that's sure to fall apart

1051
00:55:24,850 --> 00:55:33,280
A house of sand
is an empty work of art

1052
00:56:02,487 --> 00:56:09,290
A house of sand
is an empty work of art

1053
00:56:09,361 --> 00:56:12,922
Oh, you can build
a tower of clay

1054
00:56:12,998 --> 00:56:16,331
But if you ask my advice

1055
00:56:16,401 --> 00:56:19,529
Well, it's worthless, l say

1056
00:56:19,605 --> 00:56:22,574
lt's got no heart,
it's cold as ice

1057
00:56:22,641 --> 00:56:25,872
One little slip
and it tumbles down

1058
00:56:25,944 --> 00:56:28,913
One wrong step
and it crumbles all around

1059
00:56:28,981 --> 00:56:31,973
Like a house without love

1060
00:56:32,050 --> 00:56:35,645
That's sure to fall apart

1061
00:56:35,721 --> 00:56:42,126
A house of sand
is an empty work of art

1062
00:56:42,227 --> 00:56:47,392
A house of sand is an empty
work of art

1063
00:56:54,239 --> 00:56:58,801
A house of sand
is an empty work of art.

1064
00:57:22,334 --> 00:57:25,701
Oh, it's just beautiful!
Just beautiful!

1065
00:57:58,136 --> 00:58:00,434
You sure you're
going to make it?

1066
00:58:00,505 --> 00:58:01,733
Yeah, l'm sure.

1067
00:58:14,953 --> 00:58:17,513
You made it!

1068
00:58:32,204 --> 00:58:33,967
Just like
a roller-coaster.

1069
00:58:34,039 --> 00:58:35,438
lt was scary.

1070
00:58:50,355 --> 00:58:53,984
Well, what do you say
we go for a swim?

1071
00:59:16,281 --> 00:59:18,215
Now...

1072
00:59:18,283 --> 00:59:21,184
last one out of the water
is a papaya picker!

1073
00:59:36,902 --> 00:59:39,962
Uncle Rick, l don't care
if l am a papaya picker.

1074
00:59:40,038 --> 00:59:42,871
You're the prettiest little
papaya picker l've ever seen.

1075
00:59:42,941 --> 00:59:44,101
Boy, this is a neat place.

1076
00:59:44,242 --> 00:59:45,470
l could stay here forever.

1077
00:59:45,544 --> 00:59:47,444
So could l, ''Uncle Rick.''

1078
00:59:47,512 --> 00:59:49,002
Uh, we can't stay long.

1079
00:59:49,080 --> 00:59:51,742
l've got some business
to take care of.

1080
00:59:51,817 --> 00:59:54,012
Aren't l part of that business?

1081
00:59:54,085 --> 00:59:56,349
You're more pleasure
than business.

1082
00:59:56,421 --> 00:59:58,218
Well, prove it.

1083
00:59:58,290 --> 01:00:01,885
There's a third party
at this convention, you know.

1084
01:00:01,960 --> 01:00:05,361
Well, she could go bird-
watching, or something.

1085
01:00:05,430 --> 01:00:07,227
lt's getting late.

1086
01:00:07,299 --> 01:00:08,288
Time to go.

1087
01:00:08,366 --> 01:00:09,492
Let's pack up.

1088
01:00:09,568 --> 01:00:11,092
Party pooper!

1089
01:00:23,548 --> 01:00:25,914
You'd better go
wash that sand off.

1090
01:00:38,930 --> 01:00:41,160
You all packed?

1091
01:00:41,233 --> 01:00:42,359
We're all ready, Rick.

1092
01:00:42,434 --> 01:00:43,423
Come on.

1093
01:00:52,210 --> 01:00:54,178
Oh, no!

1094
01:00:58,850 --> 01:01:00,750
All right, Lani, where is it?

1095
01:01:00,819 --> 01:01:01,843
Where is what?

1096
01:01:01,920 --> 01:01:02,852
The key.

1097
01:01:02,921 --> 01:01:03,979
How would l know?

1098
01:01:04,055 --> 01:01:05,386
This is no time for games.

1099
01:01:05,457 --> 01:01:06,754
We can't stay any longer.

1100
01:01:06,825 --> 01:01:08,554
Okay, l'll make a deal with you.

1101
01:01:08,627 --> 01:01:09,753
l'm listening.

1102
01:01:09,828 --> 01:01:11,955
l'd like
your complete attention.

1103
01:01:12,030 --> 01:01:13,327
You got 15 seconds.

1104
01:01:21,640 --> 01:01:23,335
You want to renegotiate?

1105
01:01:23,408 --> 01:01:25,569
l'd like to, but l think
my mainspring's busted.

1106
01:01:25,644 --> 01:01:26,736
Now, about that key.

1107
01:01:26,811 --> 01:01:28,540
Where'd you learn
a trick like that?

1108
01:01:28,613 --> 01:01:29,910
From you.

1109
01:01:29,981 --> 01:01:31,471
Don't you remember?

1110
01:01:31,549 --> 01:01:34,643
You ''lost'' the key to your car
the first night we met.

1111
01:01:34,719 --> 01:01:37,313
That's how we got stranded
at Waimea Lookout.

1112
01:01:37,389 --> 01:01:39,118
Well, where is it?

1113
01:01:39,190 --> 01:01:41,681
l threw it over there.

1114
01:01:41,760 --> 01:01:43,455
You threw it?!

1115
01:01:52,003 --> 01:01:53,402
Hey, Uncle Rick,
what are you doing

1116
01:01:53,471 --> 01:01:54,699
digging for sand crabs?

1117
01:01:54,773 --> 01:01:55,762
Not exactly.

1118
01:01:55,840 --> 01:01:56,864
We're playing a game

1119
01:01:56,942 --> 01:01:58,807
called ''one of our keys
is missing.''

1120
01:01:58,877 --> 01:02:00,174
Oh, gee, can l play, too?

1121
01:02:00,245 --> 01:02:01,405
Why not?

1122
01:02:01,479 --> 01:02:04,039
First one to find it
gets a great big kiss.

1123
01:02:04,115 --> 01:02:06,948
Aw, heck, l'd rather have
a hot fudge sundae.

1124
01:02:14,392 --> 01:02:15,654
Look, Rick, l'll explain

1125
01:02:15,727 --> 01:02:17,661
that it all happened
because of me.

1126
01:02:17,729 --> 01:02:19,128
l don't think that'll help.

1127
01:02:19,264 --> 01:02:20,891
l wonder if they've dropped

1128
01:02:20,966 --> 01:02:22,991
the death penalty
for kidnapping.

1129
01:02:23,068 --> 01:02:25,002
Daddy won't be mad,
Uncle Rick.

1130
01:02:25,070 --> 01:02:26,401
He knows l'm with you.

1131
01:02:26,471 --> 01:02:28,132
Sure.

1132
01:02:28,239 --> 01:02:30,605
Hey, you shovel for a while.

1133
01:02:30,675 --> 01:02:32,540
Jan, you better get dressed.

1134
01:02:42,587 --> 01:02:43,576
How did it go?

1135
01:02:43,655 --> 01:02:44,815
What a mess.

1136
01:02:44,889 --> 01:02:47,153
l straightened everything
out except Belden.

1137
01:02:47,225 --> 01:02:49,159
He's already filed
a formal complaint.

1138
01:02:49,260 --> 01:02:51,160
We could lose our charter
to operate.

1139
01:02:51,229 --> 01:02:52,890
What are you doing here so late?

1140
01:02:52,964 --> 01:02:54,556
Waiting for Rick and Jan.

1141
01:02:54,632 --> 01:02:55,826
Where did they go?

1142
01:02:55,900 --> 01:02:57,993
Rick took Jan with him
to Kauai on a job

1143
01:02:58,069 --> 01:02:59,263
but that was hours ago.

1144
01:02:59,337 --> 01:03:01,931
l phoned the hotel,
but they said he'd left there...

1145
01:03:02,007 --> 01:03:03,304
with three picnic lunches.

1146
01:03:03,375 --> 01:03:04,433
Three?!

1147
01:03:04,509 --> 01:03:07,103
Maybe he picked up
a playmate for Jan.

1148
01:03:07,212 --> 01:03:09,112
Yeah, sure.

1149
01:03:09,214 --> 01:03:10,647
A playmate named Lani.

1150
01:03:10,715 --> 01:03:11,909
Some playmate.

1151
01:03:11,983 --> 01:03:14,110
What time did they leave there?

1152
01:03:14,185 --> 01:03:15,618
This morning.

1153
01:03:19,391 --> 01:03:21,120
MGA six-seven-zero

1154
01:03:21,259 --> 01:03:24,490
calling helicopter
two-zero-two.

1155
01:03:24,562 --> 01:03:26,223
Rick, this is base.

1156
01:03:26,297 --> 01:03:28,265
Can you hear me? Over.

1157
00:17:08,219 --> 01:04:07,505
[ Skipped item nr. 1157 ]

1158
01:04:07,505 --> 01:04:08,494
l'm sure of it.

1159
01:04:08,573 --> 01:04:09,562
She'd better be.

1160
01:04:09,641 --> 01:04:10,573
Where are you going?

1161
01:04:10,642 --> 01:04:11,836
The last time he was with Lani

1162
01:04:11,910 --> 01:04:13,571
they spent three days
at Moonlight Beach.

1163
01:04:13,645 --> 01:04:14,873
lt was their favorite hideaway.

1164
01:04:14,946 --> 01:04:17,039
But he wouldn't go there
with Jan along, would he?

1165
01:04:17,115 --> 01:04:18,104
Wouldn't he?

1166
01:04:18,249 --> 01:04:19,910
Sometimes he seems so nice.

1167
01:04:19,984 --> 01:04:21,542
You're married, remember?

1168
01:04:21,619 --> 01:04:23,109
You stick by the phone.

1169
01:04:23,188 --> 01:04:25,088
l'm going to try to find them.

1170
01:04:25,156 --> 01:04:26,748
Stay clear of the blades.

1171
01:04:43,541 --> 01:04:47,307
Hey, why don't we build
a signal fire with driftwood

1172
01:04:47,378 --> 01:04:49,972
like they say in the Brownies?

1173
01:04:50,048 --> 01:04:51,140
lt's a good idea.

1174
01:04:51,282 --> 01:04:52,977
We'll rest awhile,
and if no one sees us

1175
01:04:53,051 --> 01:04:54,814
then we'll, uh, then
we'll start walking.

1176
01:04:54,886 --> 01:04:56,854
Let's get some driftwood.

1177
01:05:13,171 --> 01:05:15,105
Hey, Uncle Rick,
they say in the Brownies

1178
01:05:15,240 --> 01:05:16,707
that seaweed makes more smoke.

1179
01:05:16,774 --> 01:05:18,264
Want to put some seaweed on it?

1180
01:05:18,343 --> 01:05:19,935
Sure. Why not?

1181
01:05:20,011 --> 01:05:21,273
Whew!

1182
01:05:21,346 --> 01:05:24,440
What would we do
without the Brownies?

1183
01:05:34,359 --> 01:05:36,156
Uncle Rick, look!

1184
01:05:49,707 --> 01:05:50,833
Hey, it must be Daddy.

1185
01:05:50,909 --> 01:05:52,001
He's come to rescue us.

1186
01:05:52,076 --> 01:05:54,135
Yeah, l think l'm going
to need rescuing

1187
01:05:54,212 --> 01:05:55,804
after he gets here.

1188
01:06:11,596 --> 01:06:13,427
Daddy! Daddy!

1189
01:06:13,498 --> 01:06:14,760
Are you all right, honey?

1190
01:06:14,832 --> 01:06:15,992
Oh, l'm fine.

1191
01:06:16,067 --> 01:06:17,091
We had a wonderful time.

1192
01:06:17,168 --> 01:06:18,760
We went on a picnic,
we got marooned

1193
01:06:18,836 --> 01:06:19,768
we lost the key

1194
01:06:19,837 --> 01:06:21,395
and then we built
a big signal fire.

1195
01:06:21,472 --> 01:06:23,599
Listen, you can tell me
all about it later, Jan.

1196
01:06:23,675 --> 01:06:24,733
Now you just get inside.

1197
01:06:24,809 --> 01:06:25,935
l've got to get you home.

1198
01:06:26,010 --> 01:06:28,342
Your mother's
worried about you.

1199
01:06:30,415 --> 01:06:32,474
Danny... l can explain
the whole thing to you.

1200
01:06:32,550 --> 01:06:33,915
Oh, l bet you can.
Go ahead.

1201
01:06:33,985 --> 01:06:35,282
We were stranded... marooned.

1202
01:06:35,353 --> 01:06:36,752
l lost the key.

1203
01:06:36,821 --> 01:06:38,220
Aw, come on.
That gag was old

1204
01:06:38,289 --> 01:06:40,621
when you first started
using it ten years ago.

1205
01:06:40,692 --> 01:06:42,387
But it wasn't his fault--
l lost the key.

1206
01:06:42,460 --> 01:06:43,427
Oh, sure you did.

1207
01:06:43,494 --> 01:06:44,483
l must have been crazy

1208
01:06:44,562 --> 01:06:46,587
to think l could go
into business with you.

1209
01:06:46,664 --> 01:06:47,892
We were booked solid today

1210
01:06:47,966 --> 01:06:50,093
and your little stunt
cost us every passenger

1211
01:06:50,168 --> 01:06:52,068
not to mention keeping
Jan out all night

1212
01:06:52,136 --> 01:06:53,467
and scaring us half to death.

1213
01:06:53,538 --> 01:06:55,631
We thought you were spread out
all over some mountain.

1214
01:06:55,707 --> 01:06:57,265
Calm down, Danny.
l'm telling the truth.

1215
01:06:57,342 --> 01:06:59,640
We lost the key, we spent
the whole night looking for it.

1216
01:06:59,711 --> 01:07:01,269
Save it. You can bring
the chopper back in

1217
01:07:01,346 --> 01:07:02,313
but you and l are through.

1218
01:07:02,380 --> 01:07:03,404
Our partnership's dissolved.

1219
01:07:03,481 --> 01:07:04,573
Good-bye, Uncle Rick.

1220
01:07:04,649 --> 01:07:05,741
lt was a wonderful picnic.

1221
01:07:05,817 --> 01:07:08,012
Yeah.

1222
01:07:32,844 --> 01:07:34,937
A registered letter
for Mr. Richards.

1223
01:07:35,013 --> 01:07:36,275
l'll take it.

1224
01:07:44,522 --> 01:07:47,218
Thank you.

1225
01:07:57,201 --> 01:07:59,999
l'm glad you're back,
but where are Danny and Jan?

1226
01:08:00,071 --> 01:08:01,231
Aren't they back yet?

1227
01:08:01,306 --> 01:08:03,274
Danny called Betty--
Jan's all right.

1228
01:08:03,341 --> 01:08:06,572
He was refueling at Hanalei,
but that was quite a while ago.

1229
01:08:06,644 --> 01:08:09,408
Ah, he flies that thing
like an old lady from Pasadena.

1230
01:08:09,480 --> 01:08:11,448
Oh, this just came for you.

1231
01:08:20,325 --> 01:08:23,453
l was glad to know
you hadn't crashed.

1232
01:08:23,528 --> 01:08:25,758
That's a matter of opinion.

1233
01:08:25,830 --> 01:08:27,092
Going somewhere?

1234
01:08:27,165 --> 01:08:29,190
Danny thinks he can get
along better without me

1235
01:08:29,267 --> 01:08:30,757
so let him settle up
with Blackmont

1236
01:08:30,835 --> 01:08:31,767
any way he wants to.

1237
01:08:31,836 --> 01:08:33,667
And that evens up the score.

1238
01:08:33,738 --> 01:08:34,705
That's life, fun and games.

1239
01:08:34,772 --> 01:08:35,966
Too bad Danny didn't
realize that

1240
01:08:36,040 --> 01:08:37,667
before he put himself
into hock for all this.

1241
01:08:37,742 --> 01:08:39,607
That's his problem.
l got my own to worry about.

1242
01:08:39,677 --> 01:08:41,645
Has there ever been anyone
but you, really?

1243
01:08:41,713 --> 01:08:44,113
l mean, have you ever cared
about anything or anybody

1244
01:08:44,215 --> 01:08:46,240
without thinking
what they could do for you?

1245
01:08:46,317 --> 01:08:47,284
l tried to explain to him

1246
01:08:47,352 --> 01:08:48,944
it wasn't my fault,
but he wouldn't listen.

1247
01:08:49,020 --> 01:08:51,284
l think you're more to blame
for what happens to you

1248
01:08:51,356 --> 01:08:52,584
than you're willing to admit.

1249
01:08:52,657 --> 01:08:54,124
l think you're bitter
and arrogant

1250
01:08:54,192 --> 01:08:57,457
and-and just plain selfish.

1251
01:09:01,466 --> 01:09:03,263
Danrick Airways.

1252
01:09:03,334 --> 01:09:04,892
Oh, hi, Betty.

1253
01:09:04,969 --> 01:09:06,766
No. No, not yet.

1254
01:09:06,838 --> 01:09:10,035
l-l'm sure they're all right.

1255
01:09:10,108 --> 01:09:12,406
Rick just came back.

1256
01:09:12,477 --> 01:09:13,409
You sit tight.

1257
01:09:13,478 --> 01:09:16,276
l'll ring you
the minute they get here.

1258
01:09:18,149 --> 01:09:19,081
Where could they be?

1259
01:09:19,217 --> 01:09:21,549
They should've been back here
long before this.

1260
01:09:21,619 --> 01:09:23,211
There's nothing
l can do about it.

1261
01:09:23,287 --> 01:09:25,118
Belden's had me
grounded for 30 days.

1262
01:09:33,030 --> 01:09:35,089
Rick...

1263
01:09:35,166 --> 01:09:37,100
l'm sorry, l didn't know.

1264
01:09:37,168 --> 01:09:38,260
Forget it.

1265
01:09:38,336 --> 01:09:39,928
Somebody has to find them.

1266
01:09:40,004 --> 01:09:41,596
You better notify
the authorities.

1267
01:09:41,672 --> 01:09:43,071
That'll take too long.

1268
01:09:43,141 --> 01:09:44,733
l'm going in the plane.

1269
01:09:44,809 --> 01:09:46,333
Hey, Friday.

1270
01:09:46,411 --> 01:09:48,276
Wait a minute.

1271
01:09:48,346 --> 01:09:50,473
lf they're down, you'll never
get there in a plane.

1272
01:09:50,548 --> 01:09:51,776
We'd better take the chopper.

1273
01:09:51,849 --> 01:09:54,579
But if you fly, they'll revoke
your license for good.

1274
01:09:54,652 --> 01:09:56,381
Well, that's a chance
l'll have to take.

1275
01:10:26,684 --> 01:10:28,151
Would they go this way?

1276
01:10:28,252 --> 01:10:30,277
lt's the shortest route home.

1277
01:10:38,296 --> 01:10:40,025
The only place
to land around here

1278
01:10:40,097 --> 01:10:41,428
is that stretch of beach.

1279
01:11:16,200 --> 01:11:18,361
Rick, over there to the left.

1280
01:11:46,898 --> 01:11:48,661
Uncle Rick! Uncle Rick!

1281
01:11:48,733 --> 01:11:49,665
You all right, Jan?

1282
01:11:49,734 --> 01:11:50,666
Yes, but Daddy's hurt.

1283
01:11:50,735 --> 01:11:51,827
Where is he?

1284
01:11:51,903 --> 01:11:53,063
-He's over there.
-Let's go.

1285
01:11:58,409 --> 01:11:59,842
Hey, Rick!

1286
01:11:59,911 --> 01:12:01,276
You wait right here.

1287
01:12:01,345 --> 01:12:02,972
Rick!

1288
01:12:11,289 --> 01:12:12,654
Mountain climbing again, native?

1289
01:12:12,723 --> 01:12:14,782
l tried to check the damage
to the rotor blade.

1290
01:12:14,859 --> 01:12:15,951
l slipped and fell.

1291
01:12:16,027 --> 01:12:17,289
l think my leg's broken.

1292
01:12:17,361 --> 01:12:18,794
Hey, Rick!

1293
01:12:18,863 --> 01:12:20,296
What can l do to help?

1294
01:12:20,364 --> 01:12:22,628
Get the first aid kit
out of the chopper.

1295
01:12:22,700 --> 01:12:23,826
Why didn't you radio?

1296
01:12:23,901 --> 01:12:25,664
lt conked out
when we came down.

1297
01:12:25,736 --> 01:12:28,330
l tried to set her down easy,
but without power

1298
01:12:28,406 --> 01:12:30,397
l couldn't move away
from the ledge.

1299
01:12:30,474 --> 01:12:32,135
l'm going to
get you fixed up.

1300
01:12:40,351 --> 01:12:41,943
Hold it. Easy.

1301
01:12:42,019 --> 01:12:43,953
Take it real easy.

1302
01:12:44,021 --> 01:12:46,114
Take Jan back to the chopper
and wait there.

1303
01:12:53,130 --> 01:12:55,758
He'll be all right now, Jan.

1304
01:12:55,833 --> 01:12:57,767
We didn't have first aid
in the Brownies yet.

1305
01:12:57,835 --> 01:12:58,767
l know, honey.

1306
01:12:58,836 --> 01:12:59,825
You did very well.

1307
01:12:59,904 --> 01:13:01,064
But l lit the flares.

1308
01:13:01,138 --> 01:13:02,070
All by yourself?

1309
01:13:02,139 --> 01:13:03,766
Daddy showed me how.
lt's real easy.

1310
01:13:03,841 --> 01:13:04,865
ls it?
l never lit one.

1311
01:13:04,942 --> 01:13:07,638
Well, you see, you just pull
the paper off the end

1312
01:13:07,712 --> 01:13:09,202
and strike it like a match.

1313
01:13:09,280 --> 01:13:11,373
lt's a lot easier
than building a fire.

1314
01:13:11,449 --> 01:13:13,474
Mm, sounds like it.

1315
01:13:13,551 --> 01:13:15,678
l wonder if the Brownies
know about flares?

1316
01:13:19,256 --> 01:13:20,553
Watch it.

1317
01:13:20,625 --> 01:13:23,890
Come on, attaboy.

1318
01:13:23,961 --> 01:13:26,054
All right,
what happened?

1319
01:13:26,130 --> 01:13:26,994
You wouldn't believe it

1320
01:13:27,064 --> 01:13:28,224
just like l didn't believe you.

1321
01:13:28,299 --> 01:13:29,527
Don't tell me you lost your key.

1322
01:13:29,600 --> 01:13:30,624
Worse than that.

1323
01:13:30,701 --> 01:13:31,793
After we left you

1324
01:13:31,869 --> 01:13:35,327
we stopped at the plantation
to call Betty and gas up.

1325
01:13:35,406 --> 01:13:36,771
Then we took off again.

1326
01:13:36,841 --> 01:13:38,809
15 minutes later,
l was in trouble.

1327
01:13:38,876 --> 01:13:41,140
l was so upset,
l forgot to fill her up.

1328
01:13:41,278 --> 01:13:44,611
l stopped using that gag
15 years ago.

1329
01:13:45,950 --> 01:13:47,781
You think she'll stay there?

1330
01:13:47,852 --> 01:13:50,150
She'll stay there
until l get help to move her.

1331
01:13:50,254 --> 01:13:51,448
But remember one thing.

1332
01:13:51,522 --> 01:13:52,784
Yeah, what's that?

1333
01:13:52,857 --> 01:13:54,324
That's your chopper.

1334
01:13:54,392 --> 01:13:55,654
Let's go.

1335
01:14:12,009 --> 01:14:13,101
Thank you, nurse.

1336
01:14:13,210 --> 01:14:15,110
l'll be back.

1337
01:14:21,819 --> 01:14:22,751
Another contact?

1338
01:14:22,820 --> 01:14:23,980
Well, you never know.

1339
01:14:24,055 --> 01:14:25,818
She could send us
some customers.

1340
01:14:25,890 --> 01:14:28,324
You know, like, uh,
people with broken legs.

1341
01:14:28,392 --> 01:14:29,324
How do you feel, Danny?

1342
01:14:29,393 --> 01:14:30,325
Ooh, l can't kick.

1343
01:14:30,394 --> 01:14:31,326
Very funny.

1344
01:14:31,395 --> 01:14:32,555
What about the chopper?

1345
01:14:32,630 --> 01:14:33,858
Well, l ordered the parts.

1346
01:14:33,931 --> 01:14:36,092
We should be able to
fly her out of there
in a few days.

1347
01:14:36,167 --> 01:14:37,464
A lot of good
that'll do us, huh?

1348
01:14:37,535 --> 01:14:39,298
With me in that cast
and you still grounded.

1349
01:14:39,370 --> 01:14:40,564
What's happening
with the board?

1350
01:14:40,638 --> 01:14:42,265
When are they going
to make their ruling?

1351
01:14:42,339 --> 01:14:43,271
Next week.

1352
01:14:43,340 --> 01:14:44,398
And with my record

1353
01:14:44,475 --> 01:14:45,999
they'll never let me
near an airplane again.

1354
01:14:46,077 --> 01:14:47,101
But it was an emergency.

1355
01:14:47,178 --> 01:14:48,145
Yeah, but they got rules

1356
01:14:48,245 --> 01:14:49,906
and they don't like
to see them broken.

1357
01:14:49,980 --> 01:14:51,504
lf l could just talk to Belden.

1358
01:14:51,582 --> 01:14:52,776
But he won't even see me.

1359
01:14:52,850 --> 01:14:54,340
He's going to be guest of honor

1360
01:14:54,418 --> 01:14:56,147
at the Polynesian
Welcoming Festival.

1361
01:14:56,287 --> 01:14:57,481
Yeah? When's that?

1362
01:14:57,555 --> 01:14:58,487
Saturday.

1363
01:14:58,556 --> 01:15:00,080
But you won't be able
to talk to him there.

1364
01:15:00,157 --> 01:15:01,124
Why not?

1365
01:15:01,192 --> 01:15:03,626
lt's a big affair,
top entertainment.

1366
01:15:03,694 --> 01:15:05,355
Hey, Jan's going to sing.

1367
01:15:05,429 --> 01:15:09,092
lf l can't get Belden to listen
to reason, we've had it.

1368
01:15:09,200 --> 01:15:11,691
l told you before, you won't
be able to get near him.

1369
01:15:11,769 --> 01:15:13,737
Look, why don't we forget
the whole thing

1370
01:15:13,804 --> 01:15:15,328
and open up a pizza parlor, huh?

1371
01:15:15,406 --> 01:15:16,703
Any of those girls ltalian?

1372
01:15:16,774 --> 01:15:19,038
Now you're starting
to sound like me.

1373
01:15:19,110 --> 01:15:20,975
Polynesian Welcoming Festival.

1374
01:15:26,617 --> 01:15:29,745
Oh, won't you come home
Bill Bailey?

1375
01:15:29,820 --> 01:15:32,118
Come on home

1376
01:15:32,189 --> 01:15:37,456
She moaned the whole day long

1377
01:15:37,528 --> 01:15:40,122
l'll do the cookin', honey

1378
01:15:40,264 --> 01:15:42,630
l'll pay the rent

1379
01:15:42,700 --> 01:15:46,363
l know l done you wrong

1380
01:15:46,437 --> 01:15:47,995
Ah, yes, indeed, ah

1381
01:15:48,072 --> 01:15:52,406
Remember that rainy evening
l put you out

1382
01:15:52,476 --> 01:15:58,039
With nothin', oh, nothin'
but a fine-tooth comb?

1383
01:15:58,115 --> 01:16:00,777
You see, l know l'm to blame

1384
01:16:00,851 --> 01:16:03,376
Well, now, ain't it a shame?

1385
01:16:03,454 --> 01:16:09,393
Bill Bailey,
won't you please come home?

1386
01:16:09,460 --> 01:16:11,951
Won't you come home,
Bill Bailey?

1387
01:16:12,029 --> 01:16:14,088
Will you please come on home?

1388
01:16:14,231 --> 01:16:15,994
This woman moaned and groaned

1389
01:16:16,066 --> 01:16:18,557
l'm telling you,
a-moaning and a-groaning

1390
01:16:18,636 --> 01:16:20,627
The whole day long, she said

1391
01:16:20,704 --> 01:16:23,571
l'll do the cooking, honey

1392
01:16:23,641 --> 01:16:25,632
l'll pay the rent

1393
01:16:25,709 --> 01:16:29,110
l know l done you wrong

1394
01:16:29,213 --> 01:16:31,408
Yes, indeed, ah

1395
01:16:31,482 --> 01:16:36,112
Remember that rainy evening
l a-put you out

1396
01:16:36,187 --> 01:16:41,124
With nothing, oh, nothing,
but a fine-tooth comb?

1397
01:16:41,258 --> 01:16:43,920
You see l know l'm to blame

1398
01:16:43,994 --> 01:16:46,519
Well, now ain't it a shame?

1399
01:16:46,597 --> 01:16:51,000
Ah, Bill Bailey, won't you
please come ho-o-o-ome?

1400
01:16:51,068 --> 01:16:53,229
Now, now, now, now, Bill Bailey

1401
01:16:53,304 --> 01:17:01,177
Won't you please come home?

1402
01:17:07,751 --> 01:17:09,048
Oh, you were
fine, honey.

1403
01:17:09,119 --> 01:17:10,051
Just fine.

1404
01:17:10,120 --> 01:17:12,247
Everybody else seems
to think so, too.

1405
01:17:12,323 --> 01:17:13,790
Sounds like they want more.

1406
01:17:13,858 --> 01:17:15,655
First rule of show business:

1407
01:17:15,726 --> 01:17:17,853
Always leave them wanting more,
right, Uncle Rick?

1408
01:17:17,928 --> 01:17:19,190
Right.
You were great, Jan.

1409
01:17:19,263 --> 01:17:21,094
Thanks. l'm hungry!

1410
01:17:21,165 --> 01:17:22,257
-Me, too.
-Me, too.

1411
01:17:29,206 --> 01:17:30,332
You having a good time?

1412
01:17:30,407 --> 01:17:31,396
Oh, yeah.

1413
01:17:41,952 --> 01:17:45,251
Relax, they said Belden
wouldn't be here till later.

1414
01:17:45,322 --> 01:17:47,620
You might as well enjoy
yourself in the meantime.

1415
01:17:47,691 --> 01:17:48,680
Oh, well, l am.

1416
01:17:48,759 --> 01:17:50,693
But only because you
decided to come along

1417
01:17:50,761 --> 01:17:52,524
and l promise your
husband will never know.

1418
01:17:52,596 --> 01:17:53,995
Rick, there's something

1419
01:17:54,064 --> 01:17:56,123
l think you have
the right to know.

1420
01:17:56,267 --> 01:17:58,064
l want you to know...

1421
01:17:58,135 --> 01:17:59,466
Uh... let's dance, huh?

1422
01:17:59,536 --> 01:18:00,468
What about our food?

1423
01:18:00,537 --> 01:18:01,595
Well, l-l-l'm not hungry.

1424
01:18:01,672 --> 01:18:03,833
We'll work up an appetite.

1425
01:18:13,851 --> 01:18:15,478
What's the matter?

1426
01:18:15,552 --> 01:18:17,315
What's the matter?!

1427
01:18:17,388 --> 01:18:18,821
Oh, oh, l'm sorry,
what were you saying?

1428
01:18:18,889 --> 01:18:21,449
Nothing, nothing at all.
lt wasn't important.

1429
01:18:29,133 --> 01:18:30,998
Why did you stop?
We were just starting.

1430
01:18:31,068 --> 01:18:32,228
l-l-l'll explain it
to you later.

1431
01:18:32,303 --> 01:18:33,531
What's the matter?

1432
01:18:33,604 --> 01:18:36,767
l think l better wait
for Belden outside. Look.

1433
01:18:39,910 --> 01:18:41,673
Pua and Lehua?

1434
01:18:41,745 --> 01:18:42,871
Yeah, they're all here.

1435
01:18:42,947 --> 01:18:46,348
So? l told you everybody
on the island would be here.

1436
01:19:05,469 --> 01:19:06,936
Oh, no!

1437
01:19:14,211 --> 01:19:15,735
Stop...

1438
01:19:15,813 --> 01:19:17,405
Where you are

1439
01:19:17,481 --> 01:19:20,575
Don't move an inch

1440
01:19:20,651 --> 01:19:23,882
Don't come any closer now, baby

1441
01:19:23,954 --> 01:19:27,014
You'll be in a pinch

1442
01:19:27,091 --> 01:19:30,083
Don't start
what you can't finish

1443
01:19:30,227 --> 01:19:32,923
l warn you what's in store

1444
01:19:32,997 --> 01:19:35,465
lf it's love
you're looking to get

1445
01:19:35,532 --> 01:19:38,296
You're gonna get
what you're looking for

1446
01:19:43,340 --> 01:19:44,534
Stop...

1447
01:19:44,608 --> 01:19:46,838
Where you are

1448
01:19:46,910 --> 01:19:49,777
You'd better freeze

1449
01:19:49,847 --> 01:19:53,408
Don't fool with fire now, baby

1450
01:19:53,484 --> 01:19:56,578
Don't be a tease

1451
01:19:56,653 --> 01:19:59,383
Don't start
what you can't finish

1452
01:19:59,456 --> 01:20:02,254
l told you once before

1453
01:20:02,326 --> 01:20:04,692
lf it's love
you're lookin' to get

1454
01:20:04,762 --> 01:20:07,959
You're gonna get
what you're lookin' for

1455
01:20:12,603 --> 01:20:14,798
Don't you know

1456
01:20:14,872 --> 01:20:18,103
You're walkin'
on dangerous ground

1457
01:20:18,175 --> 01:20:21,303
Listen, babe, when l make love

1458
01:20:21,378 --> 01:20:24,142
l just don't fool around,
no, l don't

1459
01:20:24,214 --> 01:20:27,149
l just don't play around

1460
01:20:27,251 --> 01:20:28,741
Stop...

1461
01:20:28,819 --> 01:20:31,344
Where you are

1462
01:20:31,422 --> 01:20:34,152
Just take it slow

1463
01:20:34,291 --> 01:20:36,919
Once l put my hands on you, baby

1464
01:20:36,994 --> 01:20:40,157
l won't let you go

1465
01:20:40,297 --> 01:20:43,164
Don't start
what you can't finish

1466
01:20:43,267 --> 01:20:45,758
One kiss and l want more

1467
01:20:45,836 --> 01:20:48,168
lf it's love
you're lookin' to get

1468
01:20:48,272 --> 01:20:51,867
You're gonna get
what you're lookin' for

1469
01:20:53,110 --> 01:20:54,509
Stop...

1470
01:20:54,578 --> 01:20:57,138
Where you are

1471
01:20:57,214 --> 01:20:59,580
Don't move an inch

1472
01:20:59,650 --> 01:21:00,810
Stop...

1473
01:21:00,884 --> 01:21:03,114
Where you are

1474
01:21:03,187 --> 01:21:05,655
You're gonna be in a pinch

1475
01:21:05,722 --> 01:21:07,656
Stop...

1476
01:21:07,724 --> 01:21:09,316
Where you are

1477
01:21:09,393 --> 01:21:11,384
You're gonna get
what you're looking for

1478
01:21:11,462 --> 01:21:12,656
Bop-bop, bah

1479
01:21:12,729 --> 01:21:14,287
Bop-bop, ba-dah, bop

1480
01:21:14,364 --> 01:21:17,595
Bop-bop, bah, ba-dop.

1481
01:21:22,806 --> 01:21:24,330
Gee, that was swell,
Uncle Rick.

1482
01:21:24,408 --> 01:21:26,467
l'll just look outside
for Belden.

1483
01:21:26,543 --> 01:21:27,601
But you haven't eaten.

1484
01:21:27,678 --> 01:21:29,145
Who can eat?
There's a storm brewing

1485
01:21:29,246 --> 01:21:31,146
and l got to get out of here
before it hits.

1486
01:21:31,215 --> 01:21:33,581
Oops, too late. lt just hit.

1487
01:21:33,650 --> 01:21:35,777
No wonder you're too
busy to come see me.

1488
01:21:35,853 --> 01:21:37,650
You took the words
right out of my mouth.

1489
01:21:37,721 --> 01:21:38,688
Hi, Jan.

1490
01:21:38,755 --> 01:21:39,687
Hi, Lani.

1491
01:21:39,756 --> 01:21:41,246
When are we going
on another picnic?

1492
01:21:41,325 --> 01:21:43,384
Well, it looks like
we're on one right now, honey.

1493
01:21:43,460 --> 01:21:45,325
l didn't know you
girls knew Rick.

1494
01:21:45,395 --> 01:21:47,795
Apparently he went right
through the sorority.

1495
01:21:47,865 --> 01:21:48,957
What loyalty.

1496
01:21:49,032 --> 01:21:51,364
l wonder if he got
to our house mother?

1497
01:21:51,435 --> 01:21:53,369
Uh... if you'll excuse me,
l was just leaving.

1498
01:21:53,437 --> 01:21:56,065
l've got business
to settle with you first.

1499
01:21:56,140 --> 01:21:58,040
That has a familiar ring.

1500
01:21:58,108 --> 01:22:00,474
Don't tell me you've been
sending him customers, too.

1501
01:22:00,544 --> 01:22:02,375
Look, ladies, l can explain
the whole thing.

1502
01:22:02,446 --> 01:22:04,641
Well, how'd he hook you
in this deal?

1503
01:22:04,715 --> 01:22:08,481
''You scratch my back
and l'll scratch yours.''

1504
01:22:08,552 --> 01:22:09,541
Oh...

1505
01:22:09,620 --> 01:22:11,588
ls this any way
to run an airline?

1506
01:22:11,655 --> 01:22:14,488
l have every intention of paying
you for the services rendered.

1507
01:22:14,558 --> 01:22:17,425
Wouldn't that be spreading
yourself a little thin?

1508
01:22:17,494 --> 01:22:19,655
l'd like to make it up to you
if you'll just give me a chance.

1509
01:22:19,730 --> 01:22:20,924
l-l'll put it on a cash basis.

1510
01:22:20,998 --> 01:22:23,023
A percentage of all
the business you book for us.

1511
01:22:23,100 --> 01:22:24,533
A percentage? ln writing?

1512
01:22:24,601 --> 01:22:25,568
ln writing.

1513
01:22:25,636 --> 01:22:27,126
Do you think we can trust him?

1514
01:22:27,204 --> 01:22:28,967
Well, l guess it couldn't hurt.

1515
01:22:29,039 --> 01:22:30,939
Any more than it already has.

1516
01:22:31,008 --> 01:22:33,738
Okay, for money,
l'll swallow my pride.

1517
01:22:33,810 --> 01:22:35,471
And if he doesn't come through

1518
01:22:35,546 --> 01:22:37,343
we'll boil him
in coconut butter.

1519
01:22:37,414 --> 01:22:39,041
Been nice doing
business with you all.

1520
01:22:39,116 --> 01:22:40,879
l think my date's getting cold.

1521
01:22:40,951 --> 01:22:42,009
Bye, girls.

1522
01:22:42,085 --> 01:22:44,349
l'll check with you later.

1523
01:22:44,421 --> 01:22:46,412
That's quite a harem.

1524
01:22:46,490 --> 01:22:48,515
Well, look, uh, l may
have made some promises

1525
01:22:48,592 --> 01:22:49,889
but that's as far as it went.

1526
01:22:49,960 --> 01:22:51,552
You're pretty free
with your promises.

1527
01:22:51,628 --> 01:22:53,323
How you going to keep
that last one?

1528
01:22:53,397 --> 01:22:55,388
l'll tell you
after l talk to Belden.

1529
01:22:55,465 --> 01:22:56,932
Good luck, Rick.

1530
01:23:03,607 --> 01:23:06,508
The performance is about
to begin in the amphitheater.

1531
01:24:13,744 --> 01:24:15,871
Now look,
l agreed to the pancake

1532
01:24:15,946 --> 01:24:17,709
or whatever it is

1533
01:24:17,781 --> 01:24:18,975
but the lipstick is out.

1534
01:24:19,049 --> 01:24:21,517
But, sir, it's necessary
for the television camera.

1535
01:24:21,585 --> 01:24:22,517
Those are my orders.

1536
01:24:22,586 --> 01:24:23,518
No lipstick.

1537
01:24:23,587 --> 01:24:24,519
-Mr. Belden.
-Yes.

1538
01:24:24,588 --> 01:24:25,555
Congratulations, sir.

1539
01:24:25,622 --> 01:24:26,554
Oh, thank you.

1540
01:24:26,623 --> 01:24:27,681
l realize this is an honor

1541
01:24:27,758 --> 01:24:29,521
but they're making me
feel like an actor.

1542
01:24:29,593 --> 01:24:31,288
Who are you?
Have we met?

1543
01:24:31,361 --> 01:24:32,885
Oh, well, sort of--
l-l know this is not

1544
01:24:32,963 --> 01:24:34,897
the time or the place
to discuss business, but...

1545
01:24:34,965 --> 01:24:35,932
l make it a rule

1546
01:24:35,999 --> 01:24:37,626
never to discuss business
outside my office.

1547
01:24:37,701 --> 01:24:39,794
Well, you wouldn't see
me at your office, sir.

1548
01:24:39,870 --> 01:24:40,928
And this is an emergency.

1549
01:24:41,004 --> 01:24:41,971
l'm Rick Richards.

1550
01:24:42,039 --> 01:24:43,370
Rick Richards?

1551
01:24:43,440 --> 01:24:46,841
Oh, you're the one responsible
for my wife not being here.

1552
01:24:46,910 --> 01:24:49,572
She threw her back out
when you ran us off the road.

1553
01:24:49,646 --> 01:24:50,806
lf you'll just listen,
Mr. Belden.

1554
01:24:50,881 --> 01:24:52,143
lf l don't get my license
reinstated

1555
01:24:52,215 --> 01:24:53,147
l'm in real trouble.

1556
01:24:53,250 --> 01:24:54,808
My partner, Danny Kohana,
hocked everything

1557
01:24:54,885 --> 01:24:55,852
to go into business with me

1558
01:24:55,919 --> 01:24:57,421
and now he's laid up
with a broken leg.

1559
01:24:57,487 --> 01:24:59,387
l know all about the rescue.

1560
01:24:59,456 --> 01:25:01,117
We're not trying
to run you out of business

1561
01:25:01,191 --> 01:25:03,682
and we're not unfairly rigid in
our interpretation of the law.

1562
01:25:03,760 --> 01:25:04,692
We realize, occasionally

1563
01:25:04,761 --> 01:25:06,092
there are mitigating
circumstances.

1564
01:25:06,196 --> 01:25:07,561
Then l-l'll get my license back?

1565
01:25:07,631 --> 01:25:10,361
Oh, when the board meets
next week

1566
01:25:10,434 --> 01:25:11,696
l'll make the recommendation.

1567
01:25:11,768 --> 01:25:14,566
lf a man risks his entire future
to save a friend

1568
01:25:14,638 --> 01:25:16,435
he can't be all bad.

1569
01:25:16,506 --> 01:25:17,871
Well, thank you,
Mr. Belden. Thank you.

1570
01:25:17,941 --> 01:25:18,965
Besides...

1571
01:25:19,042 --> 01:25:20,236
this is the first time

1572
01:25:20,310 --> 01:25:22,676
l've been able to get out
without my wife in years.

1573
01:25:22,746 --> 01:25:24,145
l think l like it.

1574
01:25:26,483 --> 01:25:27,950
Thanks again, Mr. Belden.

1575
01:25:28,018 --> 01:25:30,043
By George, l think he did it.

1576
01:25:30,120 --> 01:25:31,052
He did.

1577
01:25:31,121 --> 01:25:32,053
We're back in business.

1578
01:25:32,122 --> 01:25:33,089
All you need to do

1579
01:25:33,156 --> 01:25:34,453
is get rid of that
concrete cowboy boot.

1580
01:25:34,524 --> 01:25:36,492
l'd like to talk
to you, Mrs. Hudson.

1581
01:25:36,560 --> 01:25:37,857
Well, Rick, there's something
l've got

1582
01:25:37,928 --> 01:25:39,020
to explain to you about Friday.

1583
01:25:39,096 --> 01:25:40,927
Danny, l can spot a single girl
with my eyes closed--

1584
01:25:40,997 --> 01:25:41,929
strictly on instruments.

1585
01:25:41,998 --> 01:25:43,363
Excuse us, pal.

1586
01:25:47,404 --> 01:25:48,666
You knew all along?

1587
01:25:48,739 --> 01:25:50,570
There's some things
you just can't hide.

1588
01:25:50,640 --> 01:25:51,902
Why didn't
you say something?

1589
01:25:51,975 --> 01:25:55,638
l didn't want to spoil
your fun... and mine.

1590
01:25:55,712 --> 01:25:57,805
Oh, no!

1591
01:26:20,237 --> 01:26:25,038
This is my heaven

1592
01:26:25,108 --> 01:26:29,044
Being here with you

1593
01:26:31,081 --> 01:26:35,177
Make it last forever

1594
01:26:38,221 --> 01:26:42,385
This is my heaven

1595
01:26:42,459 --> 01:26:46,122
lt's a dream come true

1596
01:26:48,231 --> 01:26:52,793
Make it last forever

1597
01:26:55,372 --> 01:26:58,136
Here 'neath the sky

1598
01:26:58,241 --> 01:27:05,170
Beside the sea

1599
01:27:07,217 --> 01:27:10,050
This is my heaven

1600
01:27:10,120 --> 01:27:14,580
