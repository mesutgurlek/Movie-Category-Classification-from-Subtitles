1
00:01:04,589 --> 00:01:06,674
"Tell your children..."

2
00:01:06,841 --> 00:01:10,428
"Marijuana,
America's new drug menace."

3
00:01:10,845 --> 00:01:13,765
"A trained medical technician
will be in attendance."

4
00:01:13,931 --> 00:01:17,351
"As certain scenes, may cause undue
excitement in the faint of heart."

5
00:01:20,089 --> 00:01:22,050
This had better not be
a stag film.

6
00:01:28,507 --> 00:01:31,135
"Trained medical technician"
What's in this movie?

7
00:01:30,988 --> 00:01:33,365
I asked the fellow to let me
watch it ahead of time,

8
00:01:33,532 --> 00:01:35,595
But he said it would spoil
the emotional impact.

9
00:01:35,433 --> 00:01:36,559
A real showman, that one.

10
00:01:36,726 --> 00:01:38,185
You haven't seen it?!

11
00:01:38,352 --> 00:01:39,929
Well -
You're the principal, short!

12
00:01:39,977 --> 00:01:41,687
You're showing the doggone thing
in your school.

13
00:01:41,845 --> 00:01:43,795
What if he turns out
to be some kind of huckster?

14
00:01:43,795 --> 00:01:45,589
Oh, no, mr. Mayor.
This guy's on the up-And-Up.

15
00:01:46,225 --> 00:01:47,560
He works with some
federal agency.

16
00:01:47,938 --> 00:01:49,398
He had a letter and everything.

17
00:01:49,857 --> 00:01:51,441
Federal, huh?

18
00:01:51,817 --> 00:01:53,652
I guess it's okay, then.

19
00:01:53,766 --> 00:01:55,157
E- Exactly what I thought.

20
00:02:09,602 --> 00:02:11,771
Mah-Ree-Jew-Ee-Nah.

21
00:02:13,163 --> 00:02:14,331
Mah-Ree-Jew...

22
00:02:15,420 --> 00:02:17,547
Jew?

23
00:02:17,548 --> 00:02:19,035
Mah-Ree - Oh!

24
00:02:19,358 --> 00:02:21,027
Mah-Ree-Jew-A...

25
00:02:21,194 --> 00:02:22,862
Excuse me, do you know
how to say this word?

26
00:02:23,029 --> 00:02:25,156
I don't speak mexican.

27
00:02:25,323 --> 00:02:27,366
Mary-Jew...

28
00:02:38,411 --> 00:02:40,663
Good evening.

29
00:02:40,830 --> 00:02:43,791
Good evening. Good evening.

30
00:02:51,475 --> 00:02:53,981
I want to thank you all
for braving the weather.

31
00:02:53,981 --> 00:02:56,233
And coming out tonight.

32
00:02:58,575 --> 00:03:02,872
Over the years, your
Benjamin Harrison High School...

33
00:03:02,873 --> 00:03:04,351
Has hosted numerous functions.

34
00:03:04,869 --> 00:03:06,297
Graduations, for example...

35
00:03:07,305 --> 00:03:09,683
Your annual
christmas pageants...

36
00:03:09,849 --> 00:03:12,614
The drama club's recent and,
so I'm told,

37
00:03:12,614 --> 00:03:17,889
Highly-lauded presentation
of "Green Grow the Lilacs."

38
00:03:25,373 --> 00:03:29,292
But no purpose this room
has ever served

39
00:03:29,293 --> 00:03:33,337
is more important
than that which brings myself

40
00:03:33,340 --> 00:03:35,008
and my able assistant,
mr. Blumsack,

41
00:03:35,508 --> 00:03:36,551
To your community tonight.

42
00:03:38,742 --> 00:03:41,279
I assume worthy parents
like yourselves

43
00:03:41,293 --> 00:03:44,386
have photos of your kids
in your wallets, right?

44
00:03:46,681 --> 00:03:50,309
Can you take them out now
and look at them?

45
00:03:59,522 --> 00:04:01,983
Fine-Looking young lad.

46
00:04:02,150 --> 00:04:05,111
My, she's the spitting image,
isn't she?

47
00:04:08,505 --> 00:04:09,603
You all looking carefully?

48
00:04:10,541 --> 00:04:11,314
Good...

49
00:04:12,492 --> 00:04:14,052
For those pictures before you

50
00:04:14,052 --> 00:04:16,972
are the designated targets
of a deadly assassin.

51
00:04:18,455 --> 00:04:20,878
An assassin of youth,

52
00:04:20,878 --> 00:04:23,015
A new drug menace

53
00:04:23,015 --> 00:04:27,102
destroying our children in
alarmingly increasing numbers.

54
00:04:27,269 --> 00:04:29,396
Marijuana is that drug.

55
00:04:30,564 --> 00:04:34,771
A vile narcotic,
an unspeakable scourge,

56
00:04:34,771 --> 00:04:39,432
The real public enemy
number-One.

57
00:04:42,400 --> 00:04:47,663
<i>Creeping like a communist,
it's knocking at our doors</i>

58
00:04:47,663 --> 00:04:53,134
<i>Turning all our children
into hooligans and whores</i>

59
00:04:53,134 --> 00:04:58,827
<i>Voraciously devouring
the way things are today</i>

60
00:04:58,827 --> 00:05:04,929
<i>Savagely deflowering
the good old USA</i>

61
00:05:06,049 --> 00:05:08,987
<i>It's reefer madness</i>

62
00:05:08,987 --> 00:05:11,406
<i>Reefer madness</i>

63
00:05:16,475 --> 00:05:19,728
<i>Reefer madness,
reefer madness</i>

64
00:05:20,646 --> 00:05:23,750
<i>Oh, so mad</i>

65
00:05:24,179 --> 00:05:25,947
<i>See the kids</i>

66
00:05:25,947 --> 00:05:27,990
<i>Precious kids</i>

67
00:05:28,197 --> 00:05:29,990
<i>Yes, their heads
are on the chopping block</i>

68
00:05:30,157 --> 00:05:32,743
<i>And someone's got to dare
to take a stand</i>

69
00:05:36,360 --> 00:05:37,979
<i>Can't ignore anymore</i>

70
00:05:37,979 --> 00:05:39,709
<i>It could be
your son or daughter</i>

71
00:05:39,709 --> 00:05:43,488
<i>With a deadly stick of reefer
in the hand</i>

72
00:05:44,332 --> 00:05:46,334
<i>They're heading straight for</i>

73
00:05:46,501 --> 00:05:51,153
<i>Reefer madness,
reefer madness</i>

74
00:05:51,154 --> 00:05:53,343
<i>Save our kids</i>

75
00:05:53,379 --> 00:05:58,583
<i>Stealthy as a socialist,
it slithers up our shores</i>

76
00:05:58,584 --> 00:06:03,630
<i>Turning all our children
into hooligans and whores</i>

77
00:06:03,659 --> 00:06:05,623
<i>This smoking bowl of evil</i>

78
00:06:05,623 --> 00:06:08,321
<i>Bears the choking stench
of sin</i>

79
00:06:08,721 --> 00:06:13,429
<i>It burrows like a weevil
under tender christian skin</i>

80
00:06:13,429 --> 00:06:14,432
<i>This</i>

81
00:06:14,432 --> 00:06:19,203
<i>Reefer madness,
reefer madness</i>

82
00:06:19,315 --> 00:06:21,860
<i>Oh, so mad</i>

83
00:06:21,861 --> 00:06:25,229
<i>Pull the wool
from your eyes</i>

84
00:06:25,229 --> 00:06:27,201
<i>We're in need
of righteous soldiers</i>

85
00:06:27,201 --> 00:06:30,741
<i>For this merry wonder
has to be destroyed</i>

86
00:06:32,683 --> 00:06:34,753
<i>Fight the urge
of this scourge</i>

87
00:06:34,753 --> 00:06:36,755
<i>It's destructive
but seductive</i>

88
00:06:36,922 --> 00:06:41,335
<i>So some drastic measures
have to be employed</i>

89
00:06:41,364 --> 00:06:42,702
<i>To put an end to</i>

90
00:06:43,206 --> 00:06:47,953
<i>Reefer madness,
reefer madness</i>

91
00:06:47,953 --> 00:06:49,412
<i>Oh, so mad</i>

92
00:06:50,163 --> 00:06:55,283
<i>Deadly as the democrats
that empty out our stores</i>

93
00:06:55,335 --> 00:07:00,317
<i>Turning all our children
into hooligans and whores</i>

94
00:07:00,533 --> 00:07:04,889
<i>Teenagers across the land
are glazed and oversexed</i>

95
00:07:05,389 --> 00:07:10,208
<i>If you fail to draw the line,
your babies will be next</i>

96
00:07:10,208 --> 00:07:11,953
<i>Oh</i>

97
00:07:11,953 --> 00:07:15,456
<i>Reefer madness,
reefer madness</i>

98
00:07:15,623 --> 00:07:18,584
<i>Oh, so mad</i>

99
00:07:18,635 --> 00:07:19,772
<i>Tell your children!</i>

100
00:07:19,772 --> 00:07:21,113
<i>Reefer madness</i>

101
00:07:21,113 --> 00:07:22,357
<i>Fight the menace!</i>

102
00:07:22,357 --> 00:07:23,765
<i>Reefer madness</i>

103
00:07:23,765 --> 00:07:25,095
<i>Kill the Devil!</i>

104
00:07:25,095 --> 00:07:26,285
<i>Reefer madness</i>

105
00:07:26,285 --> 00:07:27,539
<i>Save the country!</i>

106
00:07:27,539 --> 00:07:28,806
<i>Reefer madness</i>

107
00:07:29,016 --> 00:07:31,351
<i>Madness, madness,
madness, madness</i>

108
00:07:31,518 --> 00:07:33,955
<i>Reefers made us
crazy, barking</i>

109
00:07:35,082 --> 00:07:39,715
<i>Mad!</i>

110
00:07:42,569 --> 00:07:44,787
Some of you may think
I'm overreacting.

111
00:07:44,787 --> 00:07:45,668
I'll say.

112
00:07:45,668 --> 00:07:47,795
I think you've come
to the wrong town, pal.

113
00:07:48,809 --> 00:07:50,933
That kind of thing
isn't a problem around here.

114
00:07:50,933 --> 00:07:52,389
You don't know our kids.

115
00:07:52,860 --> 00:07:55,279
You'd be surprised
how often I hear that

116
00:07:56,579 --> 00:07:59,857
What makes this particular drug
so dangerous.

117
00:07:59,857 --> 00:08:04,469
Is that there are no forbidding
needles or snorting powders.

118
00:08:04,967 --> 00:08:08,380
Children smoke a reefer stick,

119
00:08:08,256 --> 00:08:12,652
Thinking it to be an ordinary,
perfectly harmless cigarette.

120
00:08:12,652 --> 00:08:16,948
The kind we all used to enjoy
as teenagers.

121
00:08:16,948 --> 00:08:19,769
And before you can say
"Jack Robinson,"

122
00:08:20,223 --> 00:08:21,974
They are enslaved!

123
00:08:24,975 --> 00:08:26,953
But don't take my word for it.

124
00:08:26,953 --> 00:08:30,383
Here are the shocking,
sordid facts.

125
00:08:30,383 --> 00:08:32,884
And judge for yourselves.

126
00:08:32,884 --> 00:08:35,942
The filmed presentation
you are about to witness.

127
00:08:35,942 --> 00:08:38,739
Chronicles the harper affair,

128
00:08:38,739 --> 00:08:41,866
A true story
exhaustively documented.

129
00:08:41,866 --> 00:08:45,325
In the fine newspapers
of Mr. William Randolph Hearst.

130
00:08:47,925 --> 00:08:49,906
A true story.

131
00:08:49,957 --> 00:08:53,585
That took place in a town
very much like your own.

132
00:08:56,846 --> 00:08:57,881
Meet Jimmy Harper,

133
00:08:57,881 --> 00:09:02,243
An upstanding young lad
of some 16 summers...

134
00:09:02,243 --> 00:09:04,073
Well-Mannered, hard-Working,

135
00:09:04,073 --> 00:09:06,909
An all-Around credit
to the community.

136
00:09:09,786 --> 00:09:11,973
Right now,
jimmy's hurrying to school,

137
00:09:11,973 --> 00:09:15,552
Hoping to run into
a very special young lady...

138
00:09:15,552 --> 00:09:17,816
Mary Lane.

139
00:09:23,298 --> 00:09:26,009
Mary was a healthy young miss of
good, american breeding stock,

140
00:09:26,538 --> 00:09:31,366
God-Fearing, civic-Minded,
and very much in love.

141
00:09:46,148 --> 00:09:47,506
Just a harmless old turtle.

142
00:09:47,506 --> 00:09:48,364
See?

143
00:09:50,912 --> 00:09:53,284
Off you go.

144
00:09:53,284 --> 00:09:54,156
I thought it was a rat.

145
00:09:54,156 --> 00:09:56,901
Can I carry your books? Thanks.

146
00:09:56,901 --> 00:09:58,619
Yes, Mary and Jimmy.

147
00:09:58,619 --> 00:10:02,046
Were destined to share a love
that would last a lifetime.

148
00:10:03,368 --> 00:10:06,480
Tragically, it would be
the brief lifetime.

149
00:10:07,452 --> 00:10:09,150
Of a fruit fly.

150
00:10:13,364 --> 00:10:17,094
It's sweet of you to help me
study "Romeo and Juliet," Jimmy.

151
00:10:17,094 --> 00:10:19,332
Without your help,
come exam time,

152
00:10:19,332 --> 00:10:20,934
I would have been
on a trip for biscuits.

153
00:10:21,798 --> 00:10:23,208
Well, it's my pleasure.

154
00:10:23,208 --> 00:10:24,773
Where would you like to start?

155
00:10:24,773 --> 00:10:26,590
Probably the "proo-Low-Gwee."

156
00:10:26,590 --> 00:10:28,404
Proo-Low-Gwee?

157
00:10:28,404 --> 00:10:30,468
Oh, I think you mean
"prologue."

158
00:10:30,468 --> 00:10:33,420
I keep getting that confused
with "mon-Tay-Gwee."

159
00:10:33,420 --> 00:10:34,892
That's not even a real word.

160
00:10:34,892 --> 00:10:36,482
I looked it up in two different
dictionaries.

161
00:10:36,482 --> 00:10:39,470
Montague...
It's Romeo's last name.

162
00:10:39,912 --> 00:10:41,672
You are so smart.

163
00:10:41,672 --> 00:10:44,984
My mother says you're a boy
who's going places.

164
00:10:44,984 --> 00:10:49,160
Uh... you don't talk about me
to your mother, do you?

165
00:10:49,160 --> 00:10:51,528
I talk about you to everybody.

166
00:10:55,478 --> 00:10:57,335
Forsooth, fair Juliet,

167
00:10:57,335 --> 00:11:00,342
Would'st thou likest
yon hot chocolate?

168
00:11:00,342 --> 00:11:04,594
Oh, Jimmy, wherever did you
learn to speak like that?

169
00:11:04,594 --> 00:11:08,114
It's fancy talk
from "Romeo and Juliet,"

170
00:11:08,114 --> 00:11:11,920
'Cause when a guy
wants to woo a girl,

171
00:11:11,920 --> 00:11:14,903
He needs, you know,
the right language.

172
00:11:14,903 --> 00:11:17,850
Are you trying to woo me,
Jimmy Harper?

173
00:11:21,741 --> 00:11:24,980
<i>I need words to tell you
about my pounding heart</i>

174
00:11:24,980 --> 00:11:28,601
<i>$4 words that make a guy
sound smart</i>

175
00:11:28,601 --> 00:11:32,727
<i>Well, I guess that's why
they invented Shakespeare</i>

176
00:11:32,727 --> 00:11:36,822
<i>His articulations of a lover's
palpitations are so keen</i>

177
00:11:39,634 --> 00:11:42,989
<i>My bounty is as boundless
as the sea</i>

178
00:11:42,989 --> 00:11:46,867
<i>My love as deep,
the more I give to thee</i>

179
00:11:46,867 --> 00:11:50,696
<i>Oh, you sound so dreamy
when you talk like Shakespeare</i>

180
00:11:50,696 --> 00:11:52,263
<i>A big vocabulary</i>

181
00:11:52,263 --> 00:11:57,484
<i>Should be customary
when you fall in love</i>

182
00:11:57,484 --> 00:12:01,184
<i>La la la la la la la,
you're a snowy dove</i>

183
00:12:01,184 --> 00:12:04,753
<i>La la la
prodigious birth of love</i>

184
00:12:04,753 --> 00:12:08,632
<i>La la la la la
hip, hooray for Shakespeare</i>

185
00:12:08,632 --> 00:12:10,230
<i>Sure as I am breathing</i>

186
00:12:10,230 --> 00:12:15,648
<i>You can make
elizabethan language fun</i>

187
00:12:19,757 --> 00:12:23,246
<i>We are just like
Romeo and Juliet</i>

188
00:12:23,246 --> 00:12:26,674
<i>We're happy, young,
and bubbling with love</i>

189
00:12:26,674 --> 00:12:29,725
<i>I can't wait
to read the ending</i>

190
00:12:29,725 --> 00:12:33,845
<i>I can't, either, but I'm sure
it turns out real swell</i>

191
00:12:33,845 --> 00:12:37,006
<i>I bet Romeo</i>

192
00:12:37,006 --> 00:12:40,458
<i>Marries his Juliet</i>

193
00:12:40,458 --> 00:12:41,986
<i>They have a baby</i>

194
00:12:41,986 --> 00:12:43,915
<i>and make lots of friends</i>

195
00:12:43,915 --> 00:12:49,200
<i>That's probably the way
the play ends</i>

196
00:12:51,996 --> 00:12:55,290
<i>You dot'h teach the torches
how to burn real bright</i>

197
00:12:55,290 --> 00:12:58,758
<i>Hanging like a jewel
upon the cheek of night</i>

198
00:12:58,758 --> 00:13:02,888
<i>Hark, what light through
yonder window breaks here?</i>

199
00:13:02,888 --> 00:13:04,411
<i>We'll be future spouses</i>

200
00:13:04,411 --> 00:13:09,206
<i>Put a plague on both
our houses if we're wrong</i>

201
00:13:09,206 --> 00:13:10,375
<i>Shakespeare!</i>

202
00:13:20,635 --> 00:13:23,576
The sad truth is
that if our schools

203
00:13:23,576 --> 00:13:27,184
spent less time indoctrinating
our children in the works of...

204
00:13:27,184 --> 00:13:29,217
Bill Shakespeare...

205
00:13:29,279 --> 00:13:33,389
And focused instead on the
work of a far superior author...

206
00:13:33,389 --> 00:13:37,176
Well, things might have
turned out differently.

207
00:13:37,176 --> 00:13:39,990
And the delicate heart
of young love.

208
00:13:39,990 --> 00:13:41,199
Might not have been stabbed.

209
00:13:42,410 --> 00:13:47,781
Stabbed and pinned
to the shameful corkboard of...

210
00:13:48,708 --> 00:13:50,554
The reefer den!

211
00:14:12,019 --> 00:14:12,728
Come on, Mae.

212
00:14:13,812 --> 00:14:15,234
Get up off your duff.

213
00:14:15,234 --> 00:14:16,612
What time is it, Jack?

214
00:14:16,612 --> 00:14:18,684
Time to give this place
a going-Over.

215
00:14:18,684 --> 00:14:21,168
It looks like the marines
have landed.

216
00:14:21,168 --> 00:14:22,965
That bunch last night
was high enough

217
00:14:22,965 --> 00:14:24,518
To take over the marines
and the navy.

218
00:14:27,523 --> 00:14:28,727
Party's over, Sally.

219
00:14:31,906 --> 00:14:33,437
What a night...

220
00:14:33,437 --> 00:14:36,027
I was in more laps
than a napkin.

221
00:14:38,440 --> 00:14:40,396
Great,
now the damn baby's awake.

222
00:14:41,802 --> 00:14:43,345
Hold your water!

223
00:14:45,262 --> 00:14:49,650
Hold your water!

224
00:14:50,794 --> 00:14:51,966
Mama's coming.

225
00:14:51,966 --> 00:14:53,701
Hold your wa- Ooh!

226
00:14:53,701 --> 00:14:55,977
Oh... oh...

227
00:14:55,977 --> 00:14:57,561
Damn stairs.

228
00:15:00,983 --> 00:15:01,636
Oh!

229
00:15:03,110 --> 00:15:06,739
Yeah!

230
00:15:10,554 --> 00:15:12,305
Look at all this weed!

231
00:15:12,678 --> 00:15:15,515
Pastures of plenty!

232
00:15:22,017 --> 00:15:24,493
Keep your ham hooks
off my product.

233
00:15:24,493 --> 00:15:26,369
Just checking for bugs.

234
00:15:27,204 --> 00:15:28,914
Aah! Aah!

235
00:15:39,498 --> 00:15:41,894
Need a better class
of clientele.

236
00:15:41,894 --> 00:15:43,883
At least they're old enough
to know what they're doing...

237
00:15:43,883 --> 00:15:46,803
Not like some of those
young kids you bring up here.

238
00:15:47,907 --> 00:15:49,974
Ah, stop squawking at me.

239
00:15:49,974 --> 00:15:52,386
You got more static
than the radio.

240
00:15:53,423 --> 00:15:55,672
I'm gonna press bricks
over to the five-And-Dime,

241
00:15:55,672 --> 00:15:57,299
Bring back a couple more kids.

242
00:15:58,914 --> 00:16:00,477
You got a problem with that?

243
00:16:01,263 --> 00:16:03,724
Well, maybe I do.

244
00:16:12,934 --> 00:16:14,936
You better tune me in
and get my signal right.

245
00:16:16,266 --> 00:16:19,978
Around here, I call the shots.

246
00:16:22,194 --> 00:16:23,388
Jack...

247
00:16:24,754 --> 00:16:25,678
Oh, that's right...

248
00:16:25,678 --> 00:16:27,346
Almost forgot.

249
00:16:27,559 --> 00:16:29,312
You can't get through
the morning.

250
00:16:29,312 --> 00:16:31,290
Without a little toot, can you?

251
00:16:37,520 --> 00:16:38,882
See you in the funny papers.

252
00:17:05,811 --> 00:17:07,396
<i>I ought to leave him</i>

253
00:17:08,783 --> 00:17:12,106
<i>But something makes me stay</i>

254
00:17:12,857 --> 00:17:14,610
<i>It's the stuff</i>

255
00:17:17,882 --> 00:17:20,593
<i>I'd try to kill him</i>

256
00:17:20,760 --> 00:17:24,608
<i>But my guy gives me love</i>

257
00:17:24,608 --> 00:17:27,688
<i>And the stuff</i>

258
00:17:27,688 --> 00:17:30,156
<i>Sometimes he's rough</i>

259
00:17:30,156 --> 00:17:34,086
<i>He throws me down the stairs</i>

260
00:17:34,086 --> 00:17:37,348
<i>But deep inside he cares</i>

261
00:17:37,348 --> 00:17:40,683
<i>He buys me lingerie</i>

262
00:17:42,622 --> 00:17:44,374
<i>And the stuff</i>

263
00:17:45,163 --> 00:17:46,998
<i>Oh, oh, oh</i>

264
00:17:51,560 --> 00:17:53,693
<i>Oh, oh, oh</i>

265
00:17:54,602 --> 00:17:57,136
<i>I was a student</i>

266
00:17:57,136 --> 00:18:00,943
<i>Good grades and so naive</i>

267
00:18:00,943 --> 00:18:03,821
<i>'Till the stuff</i>

268
00:18:07,302 --> 00:18:09,388
<i>A handsome stranger</i>

269
00:18:09,554 --> 00:18:13,475
<i>Some empty promises</i>

270
00:18:13,642 --> 00:18:16,103
<i>Lots of stuff</i>

271
00:18:16,654 --> 00:18:17,947
<i>But I don't get hooked</i>

272
00:18:18,823 --> 00:18:22,804
<i>I'm not addicted, no</i>

273
00:18:22,804 --> 00:18:26,258
<i>I just enjoy the glow</i>

274
00:18:26,258 --> 00:18:28,594
<i>I like to have my fun</i>

275
00:18:28,761 --> 00:18:32,868
<i>No harm to anyone</i>

276
00:18:32,868 --> 00:18:36,580
<i>Though the fun
sometimes escapes me</i>

277
00:18:36,580 --> 00:18:41,280
<i>When Jack gets stoned
and rapes me</i>

278
00:18:47,524 --> 00:18:57,258
<i>Nothing numbs me better
than the stuff</i>

279
00:18:57,259 --> 00:18:59,282
<i>Oh, oh, oh</i>

280
00:18:59,282 --> 00:19:05,463
<i>Than the stuff</i>

281
00:19:14,410 --> 00:19:17,158
<i>In the latest issue
of Scientific American,</i>

282
00:19:17,158 --> 00:19:21,300
The Federal Bureau of Narcotics
tells us that marijuana

283
00:19:21,300 --> 00:19:26,560
possesses an addictive power beyond
even that of heroin or cocaine.

284
00:19:28,060 --> 00:19:28,794
Yes?

285
00:19:29,686 --> 00:19:31,754
Are you sure
about your facts there?

286
00:19:31,754 --> 00:19:33,589
No, no.

287
00:19:33,756 --> 00:19:36,328
Why do you ask, mr...

288
00:19:36,328 --> 00:19:37,684
Kochinski.

289
00:19:38,832 --> 00:19:42,232
My wife's cousin had himself
a problem with the heroin,

290
00:19:42,232 --> 00:19:45,006
And I done some reading,
and let me tell you,

291
00:19:45,006 --> 00:19:47,154
There's nothing more addictive
than that stuff.

292
00:19:47,154 --> 00:19:48,274
Kochinski...

293
00:19:51,134 --> 00:19:52,635
Russian name...

294
00:19:54,317 --> 00:19:55,164
Isn't it?

295
00:19:56,147 --> 00:19:57,620
It was polish.

296
00:19:57,620 --> 00:19:59,220
Actually, it's polish.

297
00:19:59,220 --> 00:20:00,176
Of course.

298
00:20:01,222 --> 00:20:02,690
I certainly applaud

299
00:20:02,690 --> 00:20:05,534
Your brave unwillingness
to believe something

300
00:20:05,534 --> 00:20:08,480
Simply because it's printed
in a silly magazine

301
00:20:08,480 --> 00:20:10,759
With the word "American"
in the title.

302
00:20:10,759 --> 00:20:14,212
You stand as a shining example
to your comrades...

303
00:20:15,358 --> 00:20:16,712
And the rest of us.

304
00:20:19,503 --> 00:20:21,501
Well, my wife might have
mixed up the story.

305
00:20:23,414 --> 00:20:27,074
I- I think it was marijuana
that her cousin was hooked on.

306
00:20:27,074 --> 00:20:30,737
It's bad - It's bad stuff.

307
00:20:31,740 --> 00:20:33,180
Bad stuff, indeed.

308
00:20:33,700 --> 00:20:36,356
Would that it had been
mere heroin...

309
00:20:39,062 --> 00:20:40,474
For, ladies and gentlemen,

310
00:20:41,278 --> 00:20:44,218
Marijuana
is an insidious master.

311
00:20:44,218 --> 00:20:48,424
Seeking slaves not in
the dark jungles of Africa,

312
00:20:50,046 --> 00:20:53,925
But right here
in each of our 48 states.

313
00:21:01,037 --> 00:21:03,594
<i>After school has let out
we just like to get out</i>

314
00:21:03,594 --> 00:21:05,680
<i>To the place where
Jitterbugging's always in style</i>

315

<i>Satchmo is a-Singing,

<i>Come and stretch

318

319
00:21:16,094 --> 00:21:18,784
<i>When your toes are tapping,

<i>Dancing, dancing</i>

322
00:21:23,639 --> 00:21:28,640
<i>Razzmatazz that always
has you sashaying, swaying</i>

323
00:21:28,640 --> 00:21:32,379
<i>Buy your gal some jujubes,
she'll be swooning</i>

324
00:21:32,379 --> 00:21:36,181
<i>Spooning down at the old
Five-And-Dime</i>

325
00:21:36,181 --> 00:21:38,818
<i>If you're feeling gloomy,
glide on over to me</i>

326
00:21:38,818 --> 00:21:41,339
<i>Try the finest cherry fizz
in all of the land</i>

327
00:21:44,308 --> 00:21:46,477
<i>My After-School oasis
gets the hopeless cases</i>

328
00:21:46,477 --> 00:21:48,980
<i>Hopping and a-Bopping
to the Five-And-Dime band</i>

329
00:21:51,883 --> 00:21:54,071
<i>You can buy yourself
a pack of smokes</i>

330
00:21:54,071 --> 00:21:56,458
<i>Laugh at all my corny
knock-Knock jokes</i>

331
00:21:56,458 --> 00:21:59,204
<i>Gotta take the gang out
to the local hangout</i>

332
00:21:59,204 --> 00:22:00,538
<i>Where Benny Goodman is king</i>

333
00:22:02,906 --> 00:22:04,895
So, you really gonna give her
your school ring?

334
00:22:04,895 --> 00:22:06,207
And how!

335
00:22:06,712 --> 00:22:09,784
Boy, that Mary Lane is one
slinky piece of homework,

336
00:22:09,784 --> 00:22:10,986
An e-Flat dillinger,

337
00:22:10,986 --> 00:22:13,055
A hop and a skip to Tastytown!

338
00:22:13,055 --> 00:22:16,230
I sure wouldn't mind taking
a bite out of that tomato!

339
00:22:16,230 --> 00:22:18,777
- Hands off, Mickey!
- I'm hep.

340
00:22:20,437 --> 00:22:21,702
Here goes nothing.

341
00:22:21,702 --> 00:22:24,094
<i>Dancing, dancing</i>

342
00:22:24,094 --> 00:22:26,651
<i>Then enjoy some funny books</i>

343
00:22:26,651 --> 00:22:29,108
<i>We get frisky, risky</i>

344
00:22:29,108 --> 00:22:31,729
<i>Cool off with a malted milk</i>

345
00:22:31,729 --> 00:22:34,192
<i>We're all bumping,
come jump in</i>

346
00:22:34,192 --> 00:22:37,692
<i>Down at the old
Five-And-Dime</i>

347
00:22:37,692 --> 00:22:39,245
Mary, I got something
to ask you.

348
00:22:39,245 --> 00:22:41,203
Did you hear the announcement
at school today?

349
00:22:41,203 --> 00:22:43,611
Next week, President Roosevelt
is coming to town.

350
00:22:43,611 --> 00:22:45,760
Wow! You know, my pop says.

351
00:22:45,760 --> 00:22:48,368
He's a labor-Appeasing,
supreme-Court packing bolshevik.

352
00:22:48,368 --> 00:22:51,237
Well, I don't know
about all that boy stuff.

353
00:22:51,237 --> 00:22:53,078
But the important thing is
there's going to be

354
00:22:53,078 --> 00:22:54,803
a big dance contest in his honor.

355
00:22:54,803 --> 00:22:56,367
And I want you
to be my partner.

356
00:22:56,367 --> 00:22:58,149
Dance contest?

357
00:22:58,149 --> 00:22:59,540
Jeez, I don't know.

358
00:22:59,540 --> 00:23:00,257
What's to know?

359
00:23:00,257 --> 00:23:01,723
I've been working
on our routine.

360
00:23:01,723 --> 00:23:02,891
Feast your peepers on this.

361
00:23:12,372 --> 00:23:14,699
<i>Feel the crazy rhythm
in your feet</i>

362
00:23:14,699 --> 00:23:17,265
<i>Everybody keep it
"reet petite"</i>

363
00:23:17,265 --> 00:23:19,956
<i>Blazing bright as neon,
maybe we could be on</i>

364
00:23:19,956 --> 00:23:21,958
<i>"Major Bbwes' amateur hour"</i>

365
00:23:23,762 --> 00:23:24,929
What's the wait, Nate?

366
00:23:24,929 --> 00:23:26,961
I got two left feet,
and they're on backwards.

367
00:23:26,961 --> 00:23:29,097
If Mary sees me dancing,
I'll lose her!

368
00:23:29,097 --> 00:23:30,585
Oh, yeah.

369
00:23:30,585 --> 00:23:31,308
Mickey!

370
00:23:31,308 --> 00:23:32,653
I'm hep.

371
00:23:33,391 --> 00:23:36,597
Well, I have to change into my
coveralls for 4-H Club tonight.

372
00:23:36,597 --> 00:23:37,507
I'll see you there.

373
00:23:41,567 --> 00:23:43,557
Hey, kid, I'm Jack.

374
00:23:44,421 --> 00:23:46,397
I'm Jimmy. Pleased to meet you.

375
00:23:46,397 --> 00:23:48,700
<i>Sometimes
men would come to call</i>

376
00:23:48,700 --> 00:23:51,196
<i>Who stank of sin
and barbasol</i>

377
00:23:51,196 --> 00:23:53,766
<i>They'd ask kids
if they felt at all</i>

378
00:23:53,766 --> 00:23:56,154
<i>Like having themselves
a few kicks</i>

379
00:23:56,786 --> 00:23:59,291
Jimmy - As in Jimmy Cagney?

380
00:24:00,098 --> 00:24:02,132
Don't I wish.

381
00:24:04,141 --> 00:24:05,543
Girl trouble, huh?

382
00:24:05,543 --> 00:24:08,069
Yeah, I got just the cure.

383
00:24:08,069 --> 00:24:10,425
What say you and I
blow this Popsicle stand

384
00:24:10,425 --> 00:24:12,475
and find ourselves
a real party?

385
00:24:12,746 --> 00:24:14,414
Gee, that's awfully nice,
Mr. Jack,

386
00:24:14,414 --> 00:24:16,859
But I'm meeting my girlfriend
at 4-H Club later.

387
00:24:16,859 --> 00:24:18,663
Come on,
we'll have some laughs...

388
00:24:18,663 --> 00:24:20,279
Half-Hour, tops.

389
00:24:20,279 --> 00:24:21,508
Gee...

390
00:24:23,130 --> 00:24:24,217
I don't know.

391
00:24:26,705 --> 00:24:28,000
Suit yourself.

392
00:24:30,130 --> 00:24:32,897
Guess you're not the hep cat
I took you for.

393
00:24:32,897 --> 00:24:34,233
Oh!

394
00:26:18,022 --> 00:26:19,048
Wow!

395
00:26:19,048 --> 00:26:21,481
You sure shake a wicked calf.

396
00:26:21,481 --> 00:26:22,958
Can you teach me
how to dance like that?

397
00:26:22,958 --> 00:26:23,851
By the time I get through,

398
00:26:23,851 --> 00:26:26,416
You'll make Fred Astaire
look like Barney Google.

399
00:26:27,000 --> 00:26:27,559
Come on.

400
00:26:27,847 --> 00:26:29,851
Well, if you're sure
it'll only be a Half-Hour.

401
00:26:29,851 --> 00:26:32,869
Kid, that's a promise
from me to you.

402
00:26:37,171 --> 00:26:39,434
<i>Dancing, dancing</i>

403
00:26:39,434 --> 00:26:41,706
<i>Charleston
till your tootsies ache</i>

404
00:26:41,706 --> 00:26:44,365
<i>We'll be grinning, spinning</i>

405
00:26:44,365 --> 00:26:46,881
<i>Romping to the savoy stomp</i>

406
00:26:46,881 --> 00:26:49,368
<i>We're rug-cutting, strutting</i>

407
00:26:49,368 --> 00:26:51,935
<i>Then as a coda
we drink Ice-Cream Soda</i>

408
00:26:51,935 --> 00:26:54,647
<i>Here down at the old
Five-And-Dime, yeah!</i>

409
00:26:57,255 --> 00:27:00,258
Do your children enjoy
Jazz Music?

410
00:27:01,947 --> 00:27:04,722
For I am here to tell you
that Cab Calloway,

411
00:27:04,722 --> 00:27:07,647
Dizzy Gillespie,
Duke Ellington,

412
00:27:07,647 --> 00:27:10,929
And the whole Weed-Blowing,
Ginger-Colored Lot

413
00:27:10,929 --> 00:27:13,481
are merely masquerading
as musicians.

414
00:27:13,481 --> 00:27:16,139
And are, in fact,
agents of evil.

415
00:27:17,682 --> 00:27:20,312
Reefer slows down
the smoker's sense of time,

416
00:27:20,312 --> 00:27:24,542
Allowing him to squeeze in
unnecessary grace notes,

417
00:27:24,542 --> 00:27:28,481
Giving this voodoo music the power
to hypnotize white women.

418
00:27:28,481 --> 00:27:31,549
Into indulging in acts
of unspeakable degradation.

419
00:27:31,549 --> 00:27:32,398
Oh!

420
00:27:34,353 --> 00:27:37,661
You will find
this profane music

421
00:27:37,661 --> 00:27:39,761
Wherever you find marijuana.

422
00:27:40,421 --> 00:27:41,224
Hear that?

423
00:27:41,729 --> 00:27:44,241
It's the national anthem
of Sodom and Gomorrah!

424
00:27:44,241 --> 00:27:47,219
Faster, Sally! Faster!

425
00:27:47,219 --> 00:27:48,397
One of them...

426
00:27:50,287 --> 00:27:52,836
That's it, Sally! That's it!

427
00:27:58,006 --> 00:27:58,490
Ooh!

428
00:28:19,838 --> 00:28:21,500
Man, I'm starving.

429
00:28:22,618 --> 00:28:23,886
We got any eats?

430
00:28:42,381 --> 00:28:43,891
Everybody, take it on the heel!

431
00:28:43,891 --> 00:28:45,768
Come on, get the lead
out of your shorts!

432
00:28:45,988 --> 00:28:47,833
Am-Scray, am-Scray!

433
00:28:47,889 --> 00:28:49,611
Damn cowbell.

434
00:28:50,958 --> 00:28:52,418
Damn baby.

435
00:28:55,093 --> 00:28:57,331
Damn... stuff.

436
00:29:17,771 --> 00:29:19,085
Come in, kid.

437
00:29:19,085 --> 00:29:20,340
Make yourself cozy.

438
00:29:22,387 --> 00:29:23,740
Who's that?

439
00:29:23,740 --> 00:29:26,352
Ralph - he was used
to be a college boy.

440
00:29:28,255 --> 00:29:30,727
Mae, this is Jimmy Harper.

441
00:29:30,727 --> 00:29:32,161
He's okay.

442
00:29:32,605 --> 00:29:35,619
Aw, Jack, this kid can't be
more than 15.

443
00:29:35,619 --> 00:29:37,253
Oh, 16, madam.

444
00:29:37,253 --> 00:29:38,372
The name's Mae...

445
00:29:38,372 --> 00:29:40,555
And a madam runs a different
kind of house.

446
00:29:48,035 --> 00:29:49,009
Shut up!

447
00:29:56,512 --> 00:29:57,541
Good baby.

448
00:30:07,346 --> 00:30:08,973
Oh, god.

449
00:30:10,995 --> 00:30:14,063
Say, who's the new fish?

450
00:30:14,063 --> 00:30:18,161
Oh, I'm J-J-Jmmy.

451
00:30:18,633 --> 00:30:21,827
Sally, why don't you
and J-J-Jimmy

452
00:30:21,827 --> 00:30:23,390
Get better acquainted?

453
00:30:25,552 --> 00:30:26,987
Give him the usual.

454
00:30:26,987 --> 00:30:30,905
If I can't turn him on,
he ain't got switches.

455
00:30:36,563 --> 00:30:38,176
How tall are you, anyway?

456
00:30:38,176 --> 00:30:40,208
Uh, 5'9 inches...

457
00:30:40,208 --> 00:30:44,151
Let's forget the 5 feet and
concentrate on the 9 inches.

458
00:30:52,887 --> 00:30:54,014
Whoopsie.

459
00:31:05,047 --> 00:31:08,585
No harm done... hero.

460
00:31:08,585 --> 00:31:09,420
Ow!

461
00:31:14,739 --> 00:31:17,717
I'm telling you, I want
that Jimmy kid out of here.

462
00:31:17,717 --> 00:31:20,049
He's too young!
I got hooked at that age,

463
00:31:20,049 --> 00:31:21,613
And I'm not doing it
to anybody else.

464
00:31:21,613 --> 00:31:25,387
Do I have water in my ear,
or you giving me guff?

465
00:31:25,387 --> 00:31:27,989
This is my house,
and I say he goes!

466
00:31:49,729 --> 00:31:50,851
Is everything okay?

467
00:31:50,851 --> 00:31:53,543
Just fell, that's all.

468
00:31:58,340 --> 00:32:01,341
Oh, let me light your cigarette
for you, there, Sally.

469
00:32:02,287 --> 00:32:03,820
This isn't a cigarette.

470
00:32:03,820 --> 00:32:05,841
It's a real smoke...

471
00:32:06,552 --> 00:32:07,805
Reefer.

472
00:32:08,607 --> 00:32:09,814
Let's share it.

473
00:32:10,589 --> 00:32:12,680
Oh, no, I shouldn't.

474
00:32:12,680 --> 00:32:15,998
Um... it's been great
meeting you folks,

475
00:32:15,998 --> 00:32:18,801
But I ought to head over
to 4-H Club.

476
00:32:18,901 --> 00:32:22,222
I'm teaching some of the newbies
how to make a potato clock.

477
00:32:22,222 --> 00:32:25,467
I didn't think you were
such a moldy fig.

478
00:32:25,467 --> 00:32:29,079
Or maybe you're scared.

479
00:32:29,293 --> 00:32:31,313
I'm not either!

480
00:32:31,982 --> 00:32:32,957
Prove it.

481
00:32:34,604 --> 00:32:36,282
<i>Come on, Jimmy,
come on, Jimmy</i>

482
00:32:36,282 --> 00:32:37,607
<i>Suck it down for Sally</i>

483
00:32:37,607 --> 00:32:39,230
<i>Come on, Jimmy,
come on, Jimmy</i>

484
00:32:39,230 --> 00:32:40,504
<i>Suck it down for Sally</i>

485
00:32:41,145 --> 00:32:41,831
Thank you, Sally,

486
00:32:41,831 --> 00:32:44,887
But I honestly don't think
it's such a good idea.

487
00:32:46,231 --> 00:32:47,883
<i>Come on, Jimmy,
come on, Jimmy</i>

488
00:32:47,883 --> 00:32:49,482
<i>Suck it down for Sally</i>

489
00:32:49,482 --> 00:32:50,873
<i>Come on, Jimmy,
come on, Jimmy</i>

490
00:32:50,873 --> 00:32:52,306
<i>Suck it down for Sally</i>

491
00:32:52,989 --> 00:32:54,117
I gotta get out of here.

492
00:32:54,117 --> 00:32:56,389
You've gotten me all confused.

493
00:32:58,494 --> 00:33:04,130
<i>Take a toke of tea stick,
take a toke of tea stick</i>

494
00:33:04,130 --> 00:33:09,981
<i>Smoke it, you may choke at
first, but then the worst is over</i>

495
00:33:09,981 --> 00:33:15,635
<i>Don't be a chicken</i>

496
00:33:15,635 --> 00:33:26,683
<i>Don't, Jimmy, don't do it,
don't be a fool</i>

497
00:33:26,783 --> 00:33:29,545
No!

498
00:34:32,493 --> 00:34:35,626
<i>Smoke the marijuana</i>

499
00:34:35,626 --> 00:34:39,624
<i>Sail the sea of sin</i>

500
00:34:39,624 --> 00:34:43,755
<i>Reach a hot nirvana</i>

501
00:34:43,755 --> 00:34:47,155
<i>Tremble from within</i>

502
00:34:47,155 --> 00:34:51,393
<i>Serve your appetite</i>

503
00:34:51,393 --> 00:34:54,850
<i>Plan to stay the night</i>

504
00:34:54,850 --> 00:34:57,943
<i>I am standing</i>

505
00:34:57,943 --> 00:35:02,373
<i>At temptation's door</i>

506
00:35:02,373 --> 00:35:05,381
<i>I have never</i>

507
00:35:05,381 --> 00:35:10,114
<i>felt this way before</i>

508
00:35:10,114 --> 00:35:13,917
<i>Join the wonder dance</i>

509
00:35:13,917 --> 00:35:16,465
<i>Lose the underpants</i>

510
00:35:16,465 --> 00:35:17,571
No!

511
00:35:17,571 --> 00:35:20,620
<i>Someone save me</i>

512
00:35:20,620 --> 00:35:24,928
<i>There's no place to hide</i>

513
00:35:24,928 --> 00:35:28,034
<i>From this hellacious</i>

514
00:35:28,034 --> 00:35:32,393
<i>Magic-Carpet ride</i>

515
00:35:32,393 --> 00:35:36,121
<i>Open up your mind,
let your body soar</i>

516
00:35:36,121 --> 00:35:39,744
<i>Arms and legs entwined,
cry, "More, more, more!"</i>

517
00:35:39,744 --> 00:35:43,263
<i>If a year goes by,
it might seem a day</i>

518
00:35:43,263 --> 00:35:47,045
<i>If a day goes by,
it could take a year</i>

519
00:35:47,045 --> 00:35:48,906
<i>Space recedes
at blinding speeds</i>

520
00:35:48,906 --> 00:35:55,149
<i>Your lust is on the rise</i>

521
00:36:10,028 --> 00:36:16,732
<i>Moloch!</i>

522
00:36:32,763 --> 00:36:35,667
<i>Tender virgin</i>

523
00:36:35,667 --> 00:36:39,941
<i>Fresh as morning dew</i>

524
00:36:39,941 --> 00:36:46,935
<i>I've been eagerly
expecting you</i>

525
00:36:47,785 --> 00:36:51,489
<i>Live the greater life</i>

526
00:36:51,489 --> 00:36:57,451
<i>Live the satyr life</i>

527
00:37:05,077 --> 00:37:07,539
<i>Eros beckons</i>

528
00:37:07,539 --> 00:37:12,053
<i>Feel the need increase</i>

529
00:37:12,053 --> 00:37:15,039
<i>Every fiber</i>

530
00:37:15,039 --> 00:37:19,440
<i>Burns for sweet release</i>

531
00:37:19,440 --> 00:37:20,912
<i>Llive a little dream</i>

532
00:37:20,912 --> 00:37:22,897
<i>Leave a little mess</i>

533
00:37:22,897 --> 00:37:24,724
<i>Everybody scream</i>

534
00:37:24,724 --> 00:37:26,700
<i>"Yes, yes, yes!"</i>

535
00:37:26,700 --> 00:37:30,606
<i>Can't you feel the flush
of pulsing pagan fire?</i>

536
00:37:30,606 --> 00:37:32,346
<i>Come and feel the rush</i>

537
00:37:32,346 --> 00:37:34,422
<i>Fly higher and higher</i>

538
00:37:34,422 --> 00:37:36,438
<i>Dancing naked
as the sinful Adam</i>

539
00:37:36,438 --> 00:37:37,721
<i>Voodoo jungle drums</i>

540
00:37:37,721 --> 00:37:41,498
<i>Coupled with a wicked madam
'Till the morning comes</i>

541
00:37:41,498 --> 00:37:43,527
<i>Yes, we're waiting
for your business</i>

542
00:37:43,527 --> 00:37:45,297
<i>In this carnal carnivale</i>

543
00:37:45,297 --> 00:37:49,680
<i>Take a one-way ticket
to the bacchanal</i>

544
00:37:49,680 --> 00:37:57,119
<i>So come on, Jimmy, come on,
give me reefer love</i>

545
00:38:35,088 --> 00:38:38,260
<i>Smoke the marijuana</i>

546
00:38:38,260 --> 00:38:41,990
<i>Sail the sea of sin</i>

547
00:38:41,990 --> 00:38:46,179
<i>And reach a hot nirvana</i>

548
00:38:46,179 --> 00:38:49,103
<i>Tremble from within</i>

549
00:38:49,103 --> 00:38:51,145
<i>Yes, we're waiting
for your business</i>

550
00:38:51,145 --> 00:38:52,824
<i>In this carnal carnivale</i>

551
00:38:52,824 --> 00:38:57,081
<i>Take a one-way ticket
to the bacchanal</i>

552
00:38:57,081 --> 00:39:06,665
<i>So come on, Jimmy, come on,
give me reefer love</i>

553
00:39:17,917 --> 00:39:18,873
Knock, knock.

554
00:39:20,329 --> 00:39:23,012
Oh, therefore art thou, Romeo.

555
00:39:23,712 --> 00:39:25,307
I've been looking for you
everywhere.

556
00:39:25,449 --> 00:39:28,438
<i>Well, I haven't been
everywhere!</i>

557
00:39:29,709 --> 00:39:32,494
Well, what a thing to say.

558
00:39:33,193 --> 00:39:35,720
I was wondering if we
could practice our steps.

559
00:39:35,720 --> 00:39:36,929
For the presidential dance.

560
00:39:36,929 --> 00:39:38,589
It's only a few days away,

561
00:39:38,589 --> 00:39:41,674
And with you being so
mysteriously busy all the time,

562
00:39:41,674 --> 00:39:43,777
I wanted to make sure we could
get in enough rehearsal.

563
00:39:47,009 --> 00:39:48,789
Jimmy, is something wrong?

564
00:39:49,178 --> 00:39:50,429
Why?

565
00:39:51,384 --> 00:39:52,761
Should something be wrong?

566
00:39:53,681 --> 00:39:55,611
Stop hounding me.

567
00:39:55,611 --> 00:39:58,203
Stop. Hounding. Me!

568
00:40:00,199 --> 00:40:01,975
I didn't think I was. I...

569
00:40:03,691 --> 00:40:04,403
Oh.

570
00:40:07,230 --> 00:40:08,461
It's me, isn't it?

571
00:40:09,626 --> 00:40:11,597
You don't love me anymore.

572
00:40:11,597 --> 00:40:14,959
You haven't even tried to kiss
me in almost a week.

573
00:40:15,312 --> 00:40:16,196
Kiss?

574
00:40:16,196 --> 00:40:18,280
Is that what you want?

575
00:40:19,177 --> 00:40:21,248
Let me show you
a few new moves!

576
00:40:22,830 --> 00:40:23,514
Aah!

577
00:40:29,712 --> 00:40:31,387
That was your tongue!

578
00:40:32,434 --> 00:40:35,235
Jimmy Harper,
what's come over you?

579
00:40:52,329 --> 00:40:56,247
Mercifully, Mary had no idea
what had come over Jimmy.

580
00:40:56,247 --> 00:40:58,815
But she feared the worst.

581
00:41:02,154 --> 00:41:05,391
<i>The sermon today
was really exciting</i>

582
00:41:06,434 --> 00:41:10,013
<i>Yahweh was mad
and did plenty of smiting</i>

583
00:41:10,013 --> 00:41:12,962
<i>With locusts and plagues
and little green froggies</i>

584
00:41:13,983 --> 00:41:16,955
<i>All that and more
thundered down from the sky</i>

585
00:41:16,955 --> 00:41:20,796
<i>I reached for your hand
like I always do</i>

586
00:41:20,796 --> 00:41:28,554
<i>But beside me was just
an empty wooden pew</i>

587
00:41:29,388 --> 00:41:34,878
<i>There's hymnals
and a rosary</i>

588
00:41:34,878 --> 00:41:39,715
<i>But they don't
keep me company</i>

589
00:41:39,715 --> 00:41:44,646
<i>The wafers now
don't taste so great</i>

590
00:41:44,646 --> 00:41:50,027
<i>They won't transubstantiate</i>

591
00:41:50,027 --> 00:41:52,633
<i>Without you near</i>

592
00:41:52,633 --> 00:41:57,500
<i>The gospel choir
sounds askew</i>

593
00:41:58,244 --> 00:41:59,955
<i>Jimmy, come back</i>

594
00:41:59,955 --> 00:42:08,893
<i>and fill my lonely pew</i>

595
00:42:09,657 --> 00:42:14,629
<i>A gloomy church
that you're not in</i>

596
00:42:14,629 --> 00:42:19,707
<i>Can lead a girl
to mortal sin</i>

597
00:42:19,707 --> 00:42:24,641
<i>A lady asked,
"Is this seat taken?"</i>

598
00:42:24,641 --> 00:42:25,995
<i>I lied, I guess</i>

599
00:42:28,433 --> 00:42:30,963
<i>I told her "Yes"</i>

600
00:42:33,996 --> 00:42:38,354
<i>I pray a holy shining star</i>

601
00:42:38,354 --> 00:42:43,432
<i>- Shining, twinkling star
- Will lead you home from where you are?</i>

602
00:42:43,475 --> 00:42:48,199
<i>- Where, oh, where you are?
- In a fog or lost at sea</i>

603
00:42:48,199 --> 00:42:53,211
<i>Or could it be
you're tired of me?</i>

604
00:42:54,379 --> 00:42:58,076
<i>It's a line of thought</i>

605
00:42:58,076 --> 00:43:01,427
<i>I'd rather not pursue</i>

606
00:43:01,427 --> 00:43:05,369
<i>Rather not pursue, Mm-Ooh</i>

607
00:43:05,369 --> 00:43:07,451
<i>Jimmy, come back</i>

608
00:43:07,620 --> 00:43:13,843
<i>And fill my lonely</i>

609
00:43:15,665 --> 00:43:22,365
<i>Pew</i>

610
00:43:28,698 --> 00:43:30,558
I've got the window open.
Give me a boost!

611
00:43:30,558 --> 00:43:31,705
- Shh!
- Ow!

612
00:43:37,645 --> 00:43:39,281
Shh!

613
00:43:52,671 --> 00:43:54,816
How much you think is in there?

614
00:43:54,816 --> 00:43:57,527
If Jack don't get his green,
we don't get ours!

615
00:43:57,787 --> 00:43:58,844
Cool your jets!

616
00:43:59,300 --> 00:44:02,541
Hear that? We got more scratch
than a sandpaper factory.

617
00:44:02,541 --> 00:44:04,714
This'll keep us in the straw
for at least a week!

618
00:44:04,737 --> 00:44:06,900
That's good! That's good!

619
00:44:08,731 --> 00:44:10,521
Frankincense - Wow!

620
00:44:24,973 --> 00:44:26,425
Reefer...

621
00:44:31,561 --> 00:44:34,996
Madness...

622
00:45:06,073 --> 00:45:09,501
Welcome to Club Celestial!

623
00:45:09,501 --> 00:45:12,289
I am your host, Joan of Arc.

624
00:45:16,057 --> 00:45:19,999
No Christian Martyr
works it harder.

625
00:45:21,252 --> 00:45:24,747
The many voices in my head
tell me that we have

626
00:45:24,747 --> 00:45:30,693
A special guest in the house tonight,
James Fenimore Harper!

627
00:45:34,062 --> 00:45:38,303
Tonight Jimmy will be taught
the error of his ways.

628
00:45:38,303 --> 00:45:40,873
By the brightest star
in our heavenly firmament...

629
00:45:41,425 --> 00:45:45,519
The Lord of Hosts,
the Stranger from the Manger,

630
00:45:45,519 --> 00:45:48,666
The Hardest-Working man
in the Afterlife,

631
00:45:50,013 --> 00:45:52,640
Give it up for Jesus!

632
00:46:17,263 --> 00:46:18,649
Aw, Jesus...

633
00:46:18,649 --> 00:46:20,511
I got a great high
cooking here.

634
00:46:20,511 --> 00:46:21,427
Don't bring me down.

635
00:46:22,315 --> 00:46:23,808
On the contrary, Jimmy...

636
00:46:23,808 --> 00:46:26,475
I'm here to bring you up with dope.

637
00:46:26,995 --> 00:46:28,564
No, not your brand of dope,

638
00:46:28,564 --> 00:46:29,609
But the straight dope.

639
00:46:30,638 --> 00:46:32,315
You think those reefer fiends
are cool?

640
00:46:33,323 --> 00:46:37,558
I don't think you realize
how cool God can be.

641
00:46:38,290 --> 00:46:40,965
<i>I floated down from Heaven</i>

642
00:46:40,965 --> 00:46:42,899
<i>When I heard a lamb had strayed</i>

643
00:46:42,899 --> 00:46:44,202
<i>Look at you here</i>

644
00:46:44,202 --> 00:46:47,102
<i>Your brain has turned
to marmalade</i>

645
00:46:47,743 --> 00:46:49,498
<i>I'm here to help you, Jimmy</i>

646
00:46:49,498 --> 00:46:51,737
<i>And return you to the fold</i>

647
00:46:51,737 --> 00:46:53,944
<i>Try filling your lungs with God</i>

648
00:46:53,944 --> 00:46:55,445
<i>And not jamaican gold</i>

649
00:46:56,649 --> 00:46:58,356
<i>Satan's bold</i>

650
00:46:58,356 --> 00:47:00,654
<i>Loves to lie</i>

651
00:47:00,654 --> 00:47:02,819
<i>Don't reply</i>

652
00:47:02,819 --> 00:47:08,103
<i>Do you want to make
the angels cry?</i>

653
00:47:08,103 --> 00:47:10,176
<i>Cry-y-y?</i>

654
00:47:10,176 --> 00:47:11,845
<i>Listen to Jesus, Jimmy</i>

655
00:47:11,845 --> 00:47:14,452
<i>Just say "no" to the marijuana</i>

656
00:47:14,452 --> 00:47:16,431
<i>Listen to Jesus, Jimmy</i>

657
00:47:16,431 --> 00:47:18,911
<i>This comes straight
from the Madonna</i>

658
00:47:18,911 --> 00:47:20,986
<i>Listen to Jesus, Jimmy</i>

659
00:47:20,986 --> 00:47:23,403
<i>I'm the face
on the shroud of turin</i>

660
00:47:23,403 --> 00:47:25,419
<i>Llisten to Jesus, Jimmy</i>

661
00:47:25,419 --> 00:47:27,936
<i>Do I need to test your urine?</i>

662
00:47:30,371 --> 00:47:33,698
<i>Satan went and conned you</i>

663
00:47:33,698 --> 00:47:35,278
<i>He conned you, Jimmy</i>

664
00:47:35,378 --> 00:47:39,287
<i>Ustn't touch his evil ganja</i>

665
00:47:39,287 --> 00:47:45,391
<i>Jimmy, don't turn your back on God</i>

666
00:47:45,391 --> 00:47:49,003
<i>Dona eis requiem</i>

667
00:47:49,003 --> 00:47:53,104
<i>Numquam fumes cannabis</i>

668
00:47:53,104 --> 00:47:58,275
<i>Aut incendes ibi inferno</i>

669
00:47:58,429 --> 00:48:01,646
<i>You'll burn in Hell</i>

670
00:48:01,646 --> 00:48:03,525
<i>I've cured a lot of lepers</i>

671
00:48:03,525 --> 00:48:06,098
<i>And I've risen from the dead?
- How you doing?</i>

672
00:48:06,098 --> 00:48:09,883
<i>Is that what it's gonna take
to get this through your head?</i>

673
00:48:09,883 --> 00:48:10,541
You can touch.

674
00:48:10,541 --> 00:48:14,898
<i>If you insist on smoking
to indulge those teenage kicks</i>

675
00:48:14,898 --> 00:48:19,235
<i>Soon you'll be floating naked
in the river Styx</i>

676
00:48:19,235 --> 00:48:21,536
<i>What a fix</i>

677
00:48:21,536 --> 00:48:23,982
<i>Sulfur pools</i>

678
00:48:23,982 --> 00:48:25,911
<i>Torture tools</i>

679
00:48:25,911 --> 00:48:30,757
<i>Separation from your
family jewels</i>

680
00:48:30,757 --> 00:48:33,101
<i>Rama-Lama, they're gonna
cut your dingdong</i>

681
00:48:33,101 --> 00:48:35,150
<i>Listen to Jesus, Jimmy</i>

682
00:48:35,150 --> 00:48:37,603
<i>Gotta give it up for lent, boy</i>

683
00:48:37,603 --> 00:48:39,596
<i>Listen to Jesus, Jimmy</i>

684
00:48:39,596 --> 00:48:42,065
<i>Or wind up as Satan's Rent-Boy</i>

685
00:48:42,065 --> 00:48:43,915
<i>Listen to Jesus, Jimmy</i>

686
00:48:43,915 --> 00:48:46,405
<i>Don't let reefer get your keister</i>

687
00:48:46,405 --> 00:48:48,412
<i>Llisten to Jesus, Jimmy</i>

688
00:48:48,412 --> 00:48:50,938
<i>I'm the poster boy for easter</i>

689
00:48:53,543 --> 00:48:57,143
<i>Jimmy, let me see you</i>

690
00:48:57,143 --> 00:48:58,223
<i>Want to see you, Jimmy</i>

691
00:48:58,223 --> 00:49:02,667
<i>Kick the sin and sinsemilla</i>

692
00:49:02,667 --> 00:49:08,437
<i>Jimmy, don't turn
your back on God</i>

693
00:49:08,437 --> 00:49:11,360
<i>For the Lord God Omnipotent</i>

694
00:49:11,360 --> 00:49:15,415
<i>Hateth marijuana, marijuana</i>

695
00:49:15,976 --> 00:49:17,473
<i>Listen to Jesus, Jimmy</i>

696
00:49:17,473 --> 00:49:20,034
<i>Thou shalt heed this holy omen</i>

697
00:49:20,034 --> 00:49:22,167
<i>Listen to Jesus, Jimmy</i>

698
00:49:22,167 --> 00:49:24,633
<i>Stop indulging like a roman</i>

699
00:49:24,633 --> 00:49:26,509
<i>Listen to Jesus, Jimmy</i>

700
00:49:26,509 --> 00:49:28,979
<i>All the cherubim say you gotta</i>

701
00:49:28,979 --> 00:49:31,090
<i>You gotta listen to Jesus, Jimmy</i>

702
00:49:31,090 --> 00:49:33,787
<i>Trust the man with the stigmata</i>

703
00:49:33,787 --> 00:49:39,839
<i>Jimmy, don't you turn
your back on God</i>

704
00:49:39,839 --> 00:49:44,117
<i>On God!</i>

705
00:49:49,484 --> 00:49:50,813
You rock, Jesus!

706
00:49:54,991 --> 00:49:55,647
Jimmy...

707
00:49:58,797 --> 00:50:00,814
Take a hit of God instead.

708
00:50:00,814 --> 00:50:03,345
You think you can handle the high?

709
00:50:08,540 --> 00:50:10,543
I got a new god now.

710
00:50:10,543 --> 00:50:14,591
Ooh...

711
00:50:32,426 --> 00:50:34,295
Hey! That's my Mary Jane!

712
00:50:34,693 --> 00:50:35,442
Think so?

713
00:50:35,442 --> 00:50:37,019
You don't own the Mary Jane.

714
00:50:37,019 --> 00:50:38,832
The Mary Jane owns you.

715
00:50:38,832 --> 00:50:40,800
Listen up, kid,
and listen good.

716
00:50:40,800 --> 00:50:42,727
Get out now
and don't look back.

717
00:50:42,727 --> 00:50:45,075
It's too late for us, but you...

718
00:50:45,075 --> 00:50:46,557
You're young.

719
00:50:46,557 --> 00:50:48,409
You still got a chance.

720
00:50:48,409 --> 00:50:50,973
Why do you got
a steak on your eye?

721
00:50:51,636 --> 00:50:53,133
Just fell, that's all.

722
00:50:53,622 --> 00:50:54,629
I'm serious, Jimmy.

723
00:50:55,648 --> 00:50:56,717
It's dangerous here.

724
00:50:57,200 --> 00:51:01,173
These days,
I got me a taste for danger!

725
00:51:03,315 --> 00:51:05,335
Back off!
You're heaped to the gills!

726
00:51:06,078 --> 00:51:07,354
And you - Zip it!

727
00:51:07,354 --> 00:51:08,631
You'll wake Sally's baby.

728
00:51:08,911 --> 00:51:11,435
That's okay, Mae.
Don't worry about it.

729
00:51:11,435 --> 00:51:15,087
Sally, how come I haven't heard
your baby crying tonight?

730
00:51:19,745 --> 00:51:20,296
Huh...

731
00:51:22,129 --> 00:51:23,842
I don't know.

732
00:51:33,525 --> 00:51:35,349
It is a matter of public record.

733
00:51:35,349 --> 00:51:37,535
That the addict
will sell anything,

734
00:51:37,729 --> 00:51:39,178
Anything at all,

735
00:51:39,178 --> 00:51:43,503
To obtain the decadent rush
of that next fix.

736
00:51:44,712 --> 00:51:46,667
You'll take good care of him,
right?

737
00:51:46,667 --> 00:51:49,247
I mean, it's not true
what they say.

738
00:51:49,247 --> 00:51:51,350
About you people
eating babies, is it?

739
00:51:51,669 --> 00:51:54,352
Care to stay for dinner?

740
00:52:05,122 --> 00:52:06,111
You're just kidding, right?

741
00:52:06,952 --> 00:52:09,273
You didn't sell your baby
for reefer money, did you?

742
00:52:09,559 --> 00:52:10,532
It's okay.

743
00:52:10,532 --> 00:52:12,080
I got another one on the way.

744
00:52:12,080 --> 00:52:13,212
Light?

745
00:52:17,218 --> 00:52:19,349
'Cause that kind of joke ain't...

746
00:52:26,978 --> 00:52:28,534
So where'd you get
this packard?

747
00:52:28,534 --> 00:52:30,376
Oh, I boosted it
from my girlfriend.

748
00:52:30,376 --> 00:52:31,207
Girlfriend?

749
00:52:31,404 --> 00:52:34,533
You expect me to believe some
Bobby-Soxer's got what it takes

750
00:52:34,533 --> 00:52:35,633
To chop your suey?

751
00:52:35,633 --> 00:52:38,668
Sally, you're getting me
steamed up like a pants presser!

752
00:52:38,668 --> 00:52:39,823
That's the idea, baby.

753
00:52:39,823 --> 00:52:42,535
Tonight, you and me are gonna
break out like the measles!

754
00:52:43,586 --> 00:52:44,454
Sally?

755
00:52:44,532 --> 00:52:46,519
Sally! Sally!

756
00:52:46,519 --> 00:52:48,381
Keep your eyes
on the road, Sally!

757
00:52:59,940 --> 00:53:02,233
Serves him right for trying to
jump over the car like that.

758
00:53:02,749 --> 00:53:05,089
Hey, mister, are you okay?

759
00:53:05,089 --> 00:53:06,294
We didn't see you there.

760
00:53:06,294 --> 00:53:07,762
I... I...

761
00:53:11,635 --> 00:53:12,693
I think he's dead.

762
00:53:17,649 --> 00:53:18,967
I was never here.

763
00:53:20,360 --> 00:53:20,943
Okay.

764
00:53:26,898 --> 00:53:28,767
Damn lamppost.

765
00:53:33,187 --> 00:53:34,439
I'm so sorry.

766
00:53:35,940 --> 00:53:37,867
I'm so sorry...

767
00:53:41,544 --> 00:53:44,123
<i>There's blood on my hands
and mud on my name</i>

768
00:53:44,123 --> 00:53:47,318
<i>My id threw a party,
and everyone came</i>

769
00:53:47,318 --> 00:53:50,403
<i>My innocence ravaged,
my virtue devoured</i>

770
00:53:50,403 --> 00:53:53,526
<i>I can't count the strangers
with whom I have showered</i>

771
00:53:59,159 --> 00:54:02,167
<i>I've taken a life</i>

772
00:54:02,167 --> 00:54:05,262
<i>Been stripped to my essence</i>

773
00:54:05,816 --> 00:54:11,660
<i>And to think all I wanted
was Swing-Dance lessons</i>

774
00:54:12,217 --> 00:54:13,095
Police! Freeze!

775
00:54:26,387 --> 00:54:29,164
<i>Local police are on the lookout
for a late model packard</i>

776
00:54:29,164 --> 00:54:31,849
<i>Spotted leaving the scene
of a Hit-And-Run homicide!</i>

777
00:54:33,723 --> 00:54:35,343
Mae was right
about the Mary Jane.

778
00:54:36,003 --> 00:54:36,887
It owns me.

779
00:54:38,337 --> 00:54:41,586
<i>Mary Jane, oh, Mary Jane</i>

780
00:54:41,586 --> 00:54:45,589
<i>You crumpled me like cellophane</i>

781
00:54:45,589 --> 00:54:49,520
<i>You stir me up like beef chow mein</i>

782
00:54:49,520 --> 00:54:53,137
<i>You wreck me, Mary Jane</i>

783
00:54:54,035 --> 00:54:57,534
<i>Mary Jane, oh, Mary Jane</i>

784
00:54:57,534 --> 00:55:01,491
<i>You've conquered me like charlemagne</i>

785
00:55:01,491 --> 00:55:05,366
<i>Pleasure intertwined with pain</i>

786
00:55:05,366 --> 00:55:09,407
<i>You wreck me, Mary Jane</i>

787
00:55:10,164 --> 00:55:14,250
<i>Your toxic kisses make my heart race</i>

788
00:55:14,250 --> 00:55:17,619
<i>faster than a cheetah</i>

789
00:55:17,619 --> 00:55:19,741
<i>I've been stapled and spindled</i>

790
00:55:19,741 --> 00:55:21,935
<i>My willpower's dwindled</i>

791
00:55:21,935 --> 00:55:26,293
<i>You melt resistance down like hot velveeta</i>

792
00:55:28,204 --> 00:55:31,501
<i>Mary Jane, oh, Mary Jane</i>

793
00:55:31,501 --> 00:55:35,484
<i>You flushed my future
down the drain</i>

794
00:55:35,484 --> 00:55:39,465
<i>Smeared me like
a ketchup stain</i>

795
00:55:39,465 --> 00:55:41,615
<i>But I need you</i>

796
00:55:41,615 --> 00:55:43,597
<i>I love you</i>

797
00:55:43,597 --> 00:55:45,965
<i>And I'm loved by Mary</i>

798
00:55:48,122 --> 00:55:55,587
<i>Loved by Mary, loved
by Mary, Loved by Mary Lane</i>

799
00:55:55,936 --> 00:56:03,669
<i>Loved by Mary, loved
by Mary, Loved by Mary Lane</i>

800
00:56:03,939 --> 00:56:11,215
<i>Loved by Mary, loved
by Mary, I'm loved by Mary Lane</i>

801
00:56:12,153 --> 00:56:14,676
There's only room for one Mary
in my life...

802
00:56:14,676 --> 00:56:18,615
Mary Lane!
With an "L", for "Love."

803
00:56:18,615 --> 00:56:20,348
I love Mary Lane!

804
00:56:20,541 --> 00:56:28,034
<i>Loved by Mary, loved
by Mary, Loved by Mary Lane</i>

805
00:56:28,113 --> 00:56:30,939
Jimmy, what are you doing here
in the middle of the night?

806
00:56:31,320 --> 00:56:33,060
It's almost 9:00 p.m.

807
00:56:34,189 --> 00:56:37,774
<i>Mary Lane, oh, Mary Lane</i>

808
00:56:37,774 --> 00:56:41,485
<i>Two words that fall like gentle rain</i>

809
00:56:41,485 --> 00:56:42,317
Did you take my car?

810
00:56:42,317 --> 00:56:45,597
<i>You touch my hand
and kill my pain</i>

811
00:56:45,597 --> 00:56:48,052
<i>I love you, Mary Lane</i>

812
00:56:48,052 --> 00:56:50,153
Jimmy, I'm in my nightgown.

813
00:56:50,153 --> 00:56:57,764
<i>You flood my world with all the
colors of the sunday funnies</i>

814
00:56:57,902 --> 00:57:02,079
<i>The innocent splendor
of kisses so tender</i>

815
00:57:02,079 --> 00:57:06,499
<i>Softer than a pillow stuffed with bunnies</i>

816
00:57:06,499 --> 00:57:07,647
Bunnies?!

817
00:57:07,647 --> 00:57:09,445
I don't know
what you're talking about,

818
00:57:09,445 --> 00:57:11,339
But I like the sound of it!

819
00:57:14,248 --> 00:57:17,883
<i>Mary Lane, oh, Mary Lane</i>

820
00:57:17,883 --> 00:57:21,928
<i>Will help you sing a new refrain</i>

821
00:57:21,928 --> 00:57:25,643
<i>With you beside, we'll start again</i>

822
00:57:25,643 --> 00:57:27,999
<i>Just me and Mary</i>

823
00:57:27,999 --> 00:57:33,982
<i>- You and Mary
- Me and Mary Lane</i>

824
00:57:33,982 --> 00:57:36,943
<i>When life becomes a rollercoaster</i>

825
00:57:36,943 --> 00:57:41,845
<i>And I can't keep my footing</i>

826
00:57:41,845 --> 00:57:43,921
<i>I'll love you completely</i>

827
00:57:43,921 --> 00:57:46,100
<i>Steady me sweetly</i>

828
00:57:46,100 --> 00:57:50,113
<i>You're sweet as Shirley Temple
dipped in pudding</i>

829
00:57:50,113 --> 00:57:53,924
<i>- Sweet as Shirley Temple pudding<i>
- Yeah, yeah, <i>Mary Lane<i> Yeah, yeah!

830
00:57:53,924 --> 00:57:57,828
<i>- Mary Lane
- Oh! Mary Lane</i>

831
00:57:57,828 --> 00:58:01,665
<i>Our hearts pound
like a diesel train</i>

832
00:58:01,665 --> 00:58:05,871
<i>The world may crumble,
we'll remain</i>

833
00:58:05,871 --> 00:58:09,986
<i>- Just me and Mary
- You and Mary</i>

834
00:58:09,986 --> 00:58:19,274
<i>- Loved by Mary
- Loved by Mary, Loved by Mary Lane</i>

835
00:58:20,209 --> 00:58:27,537
<i>Loved by Mary, loved
by Mary, Loved by Mary Lane</i>

836
00:58:27,841 --> 00:58:35,170
<i>Loved by Mary, loved
by Mary, Loved by Mary Lane</i>

837
00:58:36,229 --> 00:58:43,357
<i>- Loved by Mary, noodled Mary
- Love Mary Magdalene by Lane</i>

838
00:58:44,067 --> 00:58:51,587
<i>- Loved by Mary, loved by Mary
- Mary Lane lai moi wooo</i>

839
00:58:52,131 --> 00:58:59,677
<i>Loved by Mary, loved
by Mary, Loved by Mary Lane</i>

840
00:58:59,677 --> 00:59:02,345
<i>- Loved by Mary
- Yeah, I love you</i>

841
00:59:02,345 --> 00:59:09,500
<i>- Loved by Mary
- You got to, got to, got to love me</i>

842
00:59:09,500 --> 00:59:12,276
<i>- Loved by Mary</i>
- Hoo!

843
00:59:12,276 --> 00:59:15,592
<i>- Loved by Mary Lane
- I love you, Jimmy, yeah</i>

844
00:59:16,092 --> 00:59:26,405
<i>Loved by Mary, loved
by Mary, Loved by Mary Laaaaaane</i>

845
00:59:26,464 --> 00:59:30,701
<i>We'll sing to the rafters
of happily afters</i>

846
00:59:30,701 --> 00:59:32,509
<i>I love you</i>

847
00:59:32,509 --> 00:59:34,487
<i>You're loved by</i>

848
00:59:34,487 --> 00:59:41,876
<i>Mary Laaaaaaaaaane</i>

849
00:59:45,065 --> 00:59:47,677
Who can name for me the one,
All-Abiding,

850
00:59:47,677 --> 00:59:50,740
All-Powerful force
in the world?

851
00:59:51,655 --> 00:59:52,691
Hmm?

852
00:59:55,047 --> 00:59:56,209
Principal Short?

853
00:59:58,870 --> 01:00:01,851
What is the human condition
so powerful.

854
01:00:01,851 --> 01:00:05,408
It can stave off all
that is black and evil

855
01:00:05,408 --> 01:00:07,668
In these confusing times?

856
01:00:11,938 --> 01:00:12,904
Love?

857
01:00:13,583 --> 01:00:14,536
Oh!

858
01:00:18,608 --> 01:00:22,153
In a time in which our children
are subjected.

859
01:00:22,198 --> 01:00:25,141
To a daily diet of depravity

860
01:00:25,141 --> 01:00:26,999
in their film
and popular music?

861
01:00:27,909 --> 01:00:28,955
Ha ha!

862
01:00:29,309 --> 01:00:32,936
In a time in which
the entire world

863
01:00:32,936 --> 01:00:36,370
is aligned against
the American Way of Life,

864
01:00:36,388 --> 01:00:40,649
A time when our economy is
in a state of total collapse.

865
01:00:40,649 --> 01:00:43,517
And a reckless lunatic sits
in the White House,

866
01:00:43,517 --> 01:00:45,076
I am relieved to hear.

867
01:00:45,076 --> 01:00:48,162
Our fatuous friend
is so confident

868
01:00:48,189 --> 01:00:51,463
that love will carry the day...

869
01:00:57,493 --> 01:01:01,035
The correct answer is,
of course, "Vigilance."

870
01:01:04,999 --> 01:01:05,974
Sirens.

871
01:01:06,673 --> 01:01:08,861
There's been something
I've been meaning to give you,

872
01:01:08,861 --> 01:01:09,726
And I may not get
another chance.

873
01:01:10,157 --> 01:01:12,749
Oh, Jimmy! Your school ring?

874
01:01:14,256 --> 01:01:15,590
Is your finger swollen?

875
01:01:16,599 --> 01:01:18,140
Are you putting on weight?

876
01:01:18,140 --> 01:01:18,971
Maybe.

877
01:01:19,540 --> 01:01:21,449
Lately, I seem to be hungry
all the time.

878
01:01:21,449 --> 01:01:23,821
A moment on the lips,
forever on the hips.

879
01:01:25,004 --> 01:01:25,729
Wait.

880
01:01:25,729 --> 01:01:28,136
What you do mean,
you may not get another chance?

881
01:01:28,136 --> 01:01:30,359
I have to run away - Far away.

882
01:01:30,359 --> 01:01:32,032
- Well, then, I'm coming with you.
- No!

883
01:01:32,174 --> 01:01:35,183
It'll only ruin your life.
You have no idea what I've done.

884
01:01:35,183 --> 01:01:36,685
It doesn't matter.

885
01:01:36,685 --> 01:01:39,170
I'm wearing
your school ring now...

886
01:01:39,170 --> 01:01:41,825
Or at least I will be, as soon
as you get it off your finger.

887
01:01:41,825 --> 01:01:44,577
And if Romeo has to run away,
then so does Juliet.

888
01:01:45,490 --> 01:01:46,321
Okay.

889
01:01:46,321 --> 01:01:48,580
Go put on some clothes,
pack a bag - I'll wait.

890
01:01:48,580 --> 01:01:49,538
That's more like it.

891
01:01:49,538 --> 01:01:51,423
I believe in you, Jimmy Harper!

892
01:01:53,434 --> 01:01:55,473
Even if you do have
pudgy fingers.

893
01:02:01,255 --> 01:02:05,119
Goodbye, Mary.
You deserve better.

894
01:02:08,563 --> 01:02:09,388
Hey, kid.

895
01:02:11,940 --> 01:02:13,279
How's tricks?

896
01:02:14,017 --> 01:02:14,979
How'd you find me?

897
01:02:17,323 --> 01:02:18,829
It's all over the radio.

898
01:02:20,408 --> 01:02:22,109
Cops are looking for you
and the packard.

899
01:02:22,109 --> 01:02:23,954
I drove around your
neighborhood, 'till I found it.

900
01:02:26,985 --> 01:02:28,661
I can't have you telling
the cops

901
01:02:28,661 --> 01:02:30,296
where you get
your stagger-Leaf.

902
01:02:31,322 --> 01:02:33,181
So, what's say we head
back to Mae's,

903
01:02:33,181 --> 01:02:35,610
Where it's safe and cozy?

904
01:02:37,107 --> 01:02:38,808
This will calm you down
for the ride.

905
01:02:39,272 --> 01:02:40,735
You're talkin' on a dead phone.

906
01:02:40,735 --> 01:02:43,614
I'm through with reefer,
and I'm through with you.

907
01:02:43,879 --> 01:02:46,518
Don't think you can pull any
tricks, 'cause it won't work.

908
01:02:49,566 --> 01:02:50,354
I see.

909
01:02:51,511 --> 01:02:54,219
Well, then, I guess there's
only one thing left to do.

910
01:02:57,447 --> 01:02:59,060
You like brownies?

911
01:02:59,853 --> 01:03:01,372
Baked them myself.

912
01:03:03,229 --> 01:03:05,286
Well, I am kind of hungry.

913
01:03:11,367 --> 01:03:12,029
Thank you.

914
01:03:21,230 --> 01:03:23,795
<i>This brownie is yummy</i>

915
01:03:23,795 --> 01:03:27,215
<i>It's the greatest brownie
known to man</i>

916
01:03:27,215 --> 01:03:29,551
<i>It's chewy, it's nutty</i>

917
01:03:29,551 --> 01:03:32,650
<i>This brownie's really good</i>

918
01:03:32,650 --> 01:03:35,853
<i>Don't offer me a macaroon</i>

919
01:03:35,853 --> 01:03:38,869
<i>My brownie suits me fine</i>

920
01:03:38,869 --> 01:03:40,198
<i>There's frosting on the top</i>

921
01:03:40,198 --> 01:03:42,331
<i>And, best of all, it's mine</i>

922
01:03:42,331 --> 01:03:47,581
<i>Eat the brownie, bro-brownie
Eat the brownie, bro-brownie</i>

923
01:03:47,662 --> 01:03:49,772
Let's go home.

924
01:03:49,772 --> 01:03:50,399
Okay.

925
01:03:50,433 --> 01:03:53,053
<i>I shimmer electric</i>

926
01:03:53,053 --> 01:03:56,103
<i>I'm a one-man marching
brownie band</i>

927
01:03:56,103 --> 01:03:58,881
<i>I love it
My brownie</i>

928
01:03:58,881 --> 01:04:01,871
<i>And my brownie loves me too</i>

929
01:04:01,871 --> 01:04:04,823
<i>It's smooth, it's sweet,
it's chocolaty</i>

930
01:04:04,823 --> 01:04:07,334
<i>It forms a perfect square</i>

931
01:04:07,334 --> 01:04:09,380
<i>And the bestest part of all</i>

932
01:04:09,380 --> 01:04:11,413
<i>is I don't have to share</i>

933
01:04:11,413 --> 01:04:18,403
<i>Doesn't have to share! And the bestest
part of all is I don't have to share</i>

934
01:04:18,473 --> 01:04:23,771
<i>Eat the brownie, eat the brownie
Eat the brownie, eat the brownie</i>

935
01:04:23,854 --> 01:04:26,362
<i>Yeah!</i>

936
01:04:27,430 --> 01:04:29,540
Come on, kid. Get in the car.

937
01:04:29,540 --> 01:04:30,702
Where we're going, Jack?

938
01:04:30,702 --> 01:04:32,339
Back where you belong.

939
01:04:32,339 --> 01:04:34,331
You're one of us now.

940
01:04:34,331 --> 01:04:35,578
That's nice.

941
01:04:35,578 --> 01:04:36,548
Jimmy...

942
01:04:37,988 --> 01:04:39,029
Wait.

943
01:04:46,956 --> 01:04:48,479
Careful, Jimmy. Not too fast.

944
01:04:48,479 --> 01:04:50,616
Oh, yeah. Yeah!

945
01:04:50,616 --> 01:04:52,827
This weed is a triple scream
and one big yell.

946
01:04:52,907 --> 01:04:53,731
Aaah!

947
01:04:53,731 --> 01:04:55,230
I need more, I tell you. More!

948
01:04:56,034 --> 01:04:58,230
Always happy to oblige
a customer.

949
01:04:59,272 --> 01:05:00,026
Whoa!

950
01:05:00,961 --> 01:05:03,929
Make that a paying customer.
Pony up, kid.

951
01:05:03,929 --> 01:05:07,085
I'm busted flat, Jack.
You bled me dry.

952
01:05:08,772 --> 01:05:10,131
Not quite.

953
01:05:10,131 --> 01:05:12,414
It doesn't come off,
so don't waste your - Ow!

954
01:05:13,606 --> 01:05:15,620
I was saving that ring for Mary!

955
01:05:17,071 --> 01:05:18,728
Where else you gonna get
your fix...

956
01:05:20,155 --> 01:05:22,328
From the coloreds
down the jazz quarter?

957
01:05:22,737 --> 01:05:24,939
Those Chow-Chows
over at Madame Ling's?

958
01:05:24,939 --> 01:05:27,360
They'd bounce you
like a lead dime.

959
01:05:30,931 --> 01:05:32,721
Real gold.

960
01:05:35,701 --> 01:05:37,546
Smoke up, Pip-Squeak.

961
01:05:38,529 --> 01:05:40,893
This will get you
through the entire weekend.

962
01:05:42,231 --> 01:05:43,950
See you in the funny papers.

963
01:05:47,071 --> 01:05:49,643
He's really a nice guy,
once you get to know him.

964
01:06:16,660 --> 01:06:17,644
Oh, Jimmy.

965
01:06:18,589 --> 01:06:20,703
What have you gotten
yourself into?

966
01:06:31,468 --> 01:06:33,648
Good boy. Ha-Tcha!

967
01:06:34,870 --> 01:06:38,769
Oh, yeah. Oh, yeah.

968
01:06:42,194 --> 01:06:42,878
Oh, yeah.

969
01:06:52,255 --> 01:06:56,328
Hey, Diddle-Diddle,
a cat for my fiddle.

970
01:06:56,328 --> 01:06:59,590
One moment, please.

971
01:06:59,590 --> 01:07:01,184
I need the room!

972
01:07:04,102 --> 01:07:07,034
I got company.
You mind taking it upstairs?

973
01:07:07,758 --> 01:07:10,201
Don't mind taking it anywhere.

974
01:07:13,917 --> 01:07:15,704
Oh, yes. Oh, yeah.

975
01:07:29,350 --> 01:07:31,222
Hey, there. I'm Ralph.

976
01:07:31,222 --> 01:07:33,036
Hello. My name's Mary Lane.

977
01:07:33,036 --> 01:07:35,905
I followed my boyfriend here -
Jimmy Harper.

978
01:07:35,905 --> 01:07:36,884
Have you seen him?

979
01:07:37,353 --> 01:07:39,928
Huh, well,
he just stepped out...

980
01:07:39,928 --> 01:07:44,128
...to, uh, pick up some bibles
for our prayer breakfast.

981
01:07:44,128 --> 01:07:45,498
That's my Jimmy.

982
01:07:47,022 --> 01:07:49,306
Say, is this
a fraternity sweater?

983
01:07:51,019 --> 01:07:53,242
Is Jimmy hanging out
with college boys?

984
01:07:53,887 --> 01:07:54,821
Why, yes.

985
01:07:54,821 --> 01:07:57,049
Yes, he is.

986
01:07:57,049 --> 01:08:00,363
We at Phi-Beta...Cannabis.

987
01:08:00,363 --> 01:08:01,847
Were so taken with Jimmy.

988
01:08:01,847 --> 01:08:04,721
That we decided
to pledge him early,

989
01:08:04,721 --> 01:08:06,369
While he's still
in high school...

990
01:08:06,369 --> 01:08:07,899
Avoid the rush.

991
01:08:07,899 --> 01:08:09,528
That's the bee's knees.

992
01:08:09,528 --> 01:08:11,641
Wait 'till that Susie Mayberry
hears about this.

993
01:08:11,641 --> 01:08:15,024
Let's celebrate...
with a smoke.

994
01:08:15,024 --> 01:08:15,688
Hold on.

995
01:08:16,666 --> 01:08:20,177
This isn't that reefer
I've read about, is it?

996
01:08:20,177 --> 01:08:23,296
Oh, no. Of course not.

997
01:08:23,296 --> 01:08:25,728
This is a special cigarette,

998
01:08:25,728 --> 01:08:29,706
All the rage
with the college girls...

999
01:08:30,795 --> 01:08:31,712
In Paris.

1000
01:08:33,166 --> 01:08:34,706
P- Paris?

1001
01:08:35,351 --> 01:08:37,587
Oh, yes.

1002
01:08:37,952 --> 01:08:38,993
Well...

1003
01:08:39,820 --> 01:08:44,464
If I'm going to be dating
a fraternity man...

I'm sorry, Mr. Kochinski,

Do you have something to share

Huh, no.

1071

We're very interested to hear
what you have to say.

1072
01:12:19,103 --> 01:12:20,475
Look, it's just...

1073
01:12:21,369 --> 01:12:23,552
One puff,
and the girl goes wacky?

1074
01:12:24,175 --> 01:12:26,339
It's kind of Far-Fetched.
That's all I'm saying.

1075
01:12:26,339 --> 01:12:29,767
Not according to
Mr. William Randolph Hearst.

1076
01:12:33,184 --> 01:12:36,350
A recent edition of
his San Francisco Examiner

1077
01:12:36,350 --> 01:12:40,520
Tells us that "3/4
of the crimes of violence

1078
01:12:40,520 --> 01:12:43,541
in this country today
are committed by dope slaves."

1079
01:12:43,541 --> 01:12:46,023
That is a matter
of cold record.

1080
01:12:46,023 --> 01:12:47,939
Well, you can't believe
everything you read.

1081
01:12:47,939 --> 01:12:49,812
And that don't make me
a commie!

1082
01:12:49,812 --> 01:12:51,308
Mr. Hearst is
a very wealthy man

1083
01:12:51,308 --> 01:12:52,688
who attended
Harvard Uuniversity.

1084
01:12:52,688 --> 01:12:54,060
Where did you matriculate?

1085
01:12:56,027 --> 01:12:58,296
"Ma-tric-u-late"?

1086
01:13:00,257 --> 01:13:03,436
It means,
where did you go to college?

1087
01:13:07,962 --> 01:13:08,752
I didn't.

1088
01:13:12,389 --> 01:13:12,906
I see.

1089
01:13:14,979 --> 01:13:17,808
Well, regardless, Mr. Kochinski,

1090
01:13:17,808 --> 01:13:19,853
I'm sure everyone here
takes your opinions.

1091
01:13:19,853 --> 01:13:20,910
Very seriously.

1092
01:13:20,910 --> 01:13:22,998
Given the extremity
of your views,

1093
01:13:22,998 --> 01:13:25,353
It would be unpatriotic not to.

1094
01:13:33,643 --> 01:13:34,567
Mary?!

1095
01:13:35,112 --> 01:13:35,993

1099
01:14:04,611 --> 01:14:05,468
Billy, don't go.

1100
01:14:06,014 --> 01:14:07,500
Don't you want to learn
to dance?

1101
01:14:08,354 --> 01:14:11,665
Ah, eh, ah, oh!

1102

He's... killing... me!

1103

Oh!

Is everybody okay?!

1106
01:14:34,906 --> 01:14:38,282
I think I've been shot.

1107
01:14:42,103 --> 01:14:43,435
She fell down!

1108
01:14:45,750 --> 01:14:48,797
Mae, get me
some smelling salts.

1109
01:14:53,005 --> 01:14:55,600
All right, you two blow.
Don't talk to nobody.

1110
01:14:55,600 --> 01:14:56,719
I will handle this.

1111
01:14:58,588 --> 01:14:59,324
Go!

1112
01:15:07,590 --> 01:15:08,892
Give me that.

1113
01:15:35,545 --> 01:15:36,476
Mary?

1114
01:15:38,666 --> 01:15:39,527
Mary.

1115
01:15:40,816 --> 01:15:41,818
What - What happened?

1116
01:15:41,818 --> 01:15:43,524
You shot her dead, kid.

1117
01:15:43,524 --> 01:15:44,394
Jack, no.

1118
01:15:46,093 --> 01:15:48,741
Jimmy, I don't feel so good.

1119
01:15:49,425 --> 01:15:52,048
Shh. It's - It's gonna be okay.

1120
01:15:52,282 --> 01:15:53,045
I promise.

1121
01:15:53,159 --> 01:15:55,822
I feel so cold.

1122
01:16:01,960 --> 01:16:02,870
Give me the ring!

1123
01:16:03,528 --> 01:16:05,098
Well, looky here.

1124
01:16:05,822 --> 01:16:08,922
Casper Milky-Toast
is givin' me orders.

1125
01:16:09,487 --> 01:16:10,444
I shot Mary.

1126
01:16:10,911 --> 01:16:12,566
What makes you think
I won't shoot you?

1127
01:16:30,875 --> 01:16:33,961
Oh, Jimmy...your school ring...

1128
01:16:33,961 --> 01:16:37,810
Oh, it glitters, like a star.

1129
01:16:41,746 --> 01:16:47,775
<i>We are just like
Romeo and Juliet</i>

1130
01:16:47,775 --> 01:16:51,218
<i>We're happy, young, and...</i>

1131
01:16:55,110 --> 01:16:58,282
<i>Hemorrhaging blood</i>

1132
01:16:58,282 --> 01:17:02,546
<i>Did you get to read the ending?</i>

1133
01:17:02,546 --> 01:17:04,622
<i>Was it perfect?</i>

1134
01:17:04,622 --> 01:17:09,742
<i>Did they love until they got old?</i>

1135
01:17:18,253 --> 01:17:19,106
It was beautiful.

1136
01:17:19,106 --> 01:17:20,868
They grew up,

1137
01:17:20,868 --> 01:17:23,063
And everyone they knew
came to the wedding.

1138
01:17:24,119 --> 01:17:25,816
Did they have babies?

1139
01:17:25,816 --> 01:17:28,885
Yeah... six of them.

1140
01:17:28,957 --> 01:17:30,084
That's good.

1141
01:17:30,084 --> 01:17:32,240
I love babies.

1142
01:17:40,056 --> 01:17:42,136
<i>It makes me happy</i>

1143
01:17:42,136 --> 01:17:46,602
<i>Knowing that we loved
like Romeo and...</i>

1144
01:17:53,413 --> 01:17:54,628
Juliet.

1145
01:17:56,676 --> 01:18:00,323
Mary,
how could I have shot you?

1146
01:18:09,038 --> 01:18:09,854
Coppers.

1147
01:18:10,540 --> 01:18:13,382
Jimmy, out the back. Hurry!

1148
01:18:13,406 --> 01:18:15,621
No, Mae, I pulled the trigger.

1149
01:18:15,621 --> 01:18:16,533
I have to face my punishment.

1150
01:18:16,533 --> 01:18:19,516
Don't you get it?
Jack was holding the gun.

1151
01:18:19,516 --> 01:18:21,284
He's planning to frame you.

1152
01:18:22,631 --> 01:18:23,910
Nobody move!

1153
01:18:23,910 --> 01:18:25,698
Officer, thank god.

1154
01:18:25,698 --> 01:18:27,864
This kid burst in here
with a gun.

1155
01:18:27,864 --> 01:18:30,488
And started shooting -
Shooting and laughing!

1156
01:18:30,488 --> 01:18:33,930
I think he might have been
smoking that... reefer!

1157
01:18:33,930 --> 01:18:36,343
Just like you read about
in the papers.

1158
01:18:38,980 --> 01:18:41,408
No, that's a lie!

1159
01:18:41,408 --> 01:18:43,490
Tell them what
really happened, Mae.

1160
01:18:45,208 --> 01:18:46,380
Ma'am, do you have anything
to say?

1161
01:18:47,556 --> 01:18:48,236
Well, I...

1162
01:18:50,088 --> 01:18:51,150
Jimmy, I...

1163
01:18:52,528 --> 01:18:52,981
Oh.

1164
01:18:54,188 --> 01:18:54,968
Officer, I...

1165
01:18:55,797 --> 01:18:57,054
Mae, please!

1166
01:19:06,966 --> 01:19:07,654
No.

1167
01:19:10,243 --> 01:19:11,836
The kid burst in shooting...

1168
01:19:12,505 --> 01:19:15,039
Just like the man said.

1169
01:19:16,954 --> 01:19:20,797
Mae... no!

1170
01:19:20,978 --> 01:19:22,391
Kid's gonna burn for this.

1171
01:19:23,560 --> 01:19:25,786
Pity - Attractive girl.

1172
01:19:46,111 --> 01:19:48,114
After a swift trial,

1173
01:19:48,114 --> 01:19:51,158
James Fenimore Harper
was found guilty

1174
01:19:51,158 --> 01:19:53,180
of the murder of Mary Lane.

1175
01:19:53,276 --> 01:19:55,103
And sentenced to death row.

1176
01:19:55,417 --> 01:19:56,977
In his thought-Provoking book,

1177
01:19:56,977 --> 01:19:59,525
"Marijuana, Weed of Madness,"

1178
01:19:59,525 --> 01:20:03,298
Earle Albert Rowell explains
How marijuana causes prison inmates.

1179
01:20:03,298 --> 01:20:05,703
"To fall desperately in love
with each other...

1180
01:20:05,703 --> 01:20:09,660
Just as they would with women
outside prison walls."

1181
01:20:21,704 --> 01:20:24,110
<i>Hello, Mr. and Mrs. America
and all the ships at sea.</i>

1182
01:20:24,110 --> 01:20:25,345
<i>Let's go to press. Flash!</i>

1183
01:20:25,618 --> 01:20:27,577
<i>Tonight, Jimmy
"The Cannabis Killer" Harper</i>

1184
01:20:27,577 --> 01:20:29,360
<i>walks the last mile
to the electric chair,</i>

1185
01:20:29,360 --> 01:20:31,290
<i>Convicted of murder
while under the influence</i>

1186
01:20:31,290 --> 01:20:33,432
<i>of the new drug menace,
Marijuana.</i>

1187
01:20:34,905 --> 01:20:37,091
Shut up. Shut up!

1188
01:20:37,091 --> 01:20:38,964
We can't just let Jimmy die.

1189
01:20:38,964 --> 01:20:40,863
Shut up! Shut up!

1190
01:20:40,863 --> 01:20:42,576
Look, the kid's
yesterday's headlines,

1191
01:20:42,576 --> 01:20:44,032
And there's nothing
we can do about it.

1192
01:20:44,032 --> 01:20:46,331
When's Jack bringing
some new boys home?

1193
01:20:46,331 --> 01:20:48,934
Shut up! Shut up!

1194
01:20:48,934 --> 01:20:51,962
You shut up!
What are you, nuts?

1195
01:20:51,962 --> 01:20:56,780
I'm... fine.

1196
01:20:59,646 --> 01:21:02,379
Perfectly in control.

1197
01:21:13,385 --> 01:21:16,105
<i>Remember me, Ralph?
I'm about to fry</i>

1198
01:21:16,105 --> 01:21:16,861
Shut up!

1199
01:21:16,861 --> 01:21:18,762
<i>While you and your friends
stand idly by</i>

1200
01:21:18,762 --> 01:21:21,676
<i>- My life is now a ticking bomb</i>
- Shut up!

1201
01:21:21,692 --> 01:21:24,087
<i>I'm gonna miss
my senior prom</i>

1202
01:21:24,087 --> 01:21:25,266
Shut up! Shut up!

1203
01:21:25,266 --> 01:21:27,387
<i>You murdered me, Ralph</i>

1204
01:21:27,387 --> 01:21:28,092
Shut up!

1205
01:21:28,092 --> 01:21:29,592
<i>- Murdered me
- Murdered you</i>

1206
01:21:29,592 --> 01:21:30,933
<i>- Murdered me
- Murdered him</i>

1207
01:21:32,506 --> 01:21:33,848
Everything okay up there?

1208
01:21:33,848 --> 01:21:36,550
It's the kid!
He's in the toilet!

1209
01:21:36,550 --> 01:21:38,187
Just flush him, Ralph.

1210
01:21:40,371 --> 01:21:42,136
Aaah!

1211
01:21:44,602 --> 01:21:45,640
Whoa.

1212
01:21:47,968 --> 01:21:49,938
You better cool off
on the muggles, there.

1213
01:21:49,938 --> 01:21:51,941
Just a little hungry.
That's all.

1214
01:22:00,390 --> 01:22:03,218
<i>Remember me, Ralph
I've been sent to Hell</i>

1215
01:22:03,218 --> 01:22:06,133
<i>A pubescent edition of Jezebel</i>

1216
01:22:06,133 --> 01:22:08,721
<i>It hurts a lot to bend</i>

1217
01:22:08,721 --> 01:22:11,160
<i>But at least
I've made a friend</i>

1218
01:22:11,160 --> 01:22:11,954
Shut up!

1219
01:22:11,954 --> 01:22:14,710
<i>You murdered her, Ralph</i>

1220
01:22:14,710 --> 01:22:15,598
<i>Murdered me</i>

1221
01:22:15,598 --> 01:22:17,333
<i>- Murdered you
- Murdered me</i>

1222
01:22:17,333 --> 01:22:18,287
<i>Murdered them</i>

1223
01:22:22,830 --> 01:22:23,486
What's eating him?

1224
01:22:24,307 --> 01:22:27,066
Jack, I saw Satan! And the kid!

1225
01:22:27,066 --> 01:22:29,077
And Satan! And the girl!
And Satan!

1226
01:22:29,077 --> 01:22:30,970
That mug's wound up
like an 8-Day clock.

1227
01:22:30,970 --> 01:22:32,409
One too many giggle sticks.

1228
01:22:32,409 --> 01:22:34,380
You'd better put your flaps down
before you take off.

1229
01:22:34,380 --> 01:22:35,150
Go get some air.

1230
01:22:35,150 --> 01:22:38,149
No, Jack! Not out there, Jack!

1231
01:22:38,149 --> 01:22:39,976
No! No!

1232
01:22:39,976 --> 01:22:43,639
Jack! Jack!

1233
01:22:52,572 --> 01:22:54,679
Just a little too much weed.
That's all.

1234
01:22:54,679 --> 01:22:55,879
Aaaah!

1235
01:22:58,872 --> 01:23:00,708
Just an ordinary scarecrow.

1236
01:23:07,082 --> 01:23:08,768
Aaaah!

1237
01:23:11,852 --> 01:23:12,905
Aaah!

1238
01:23:13,615 --> 01:23:14,344
Aaah!

1239
01:23:16,724 --> 01:23:18,952
<i>Open the gate
and abandon hope</i>

1240
01:23:18,952 --> 01:23:21,849
<i>With the ghosts of the kids
that got hooked on dope</i>

1241
01:23:21,849 --> 01:23:24,680
<i>Way down where it's hot</i>

1242
01:23:24,680 --> 01:23:27,639
<i>They are saving us a spot</i>

1243
01:23:27,639 --> 01:23:30,850
<i>You murdered them, Ralph</i>

1244
01:23:30,850 --> 01:23:33,719
<i>Murdered them,
murdered them</i>

1245
01:23:34,030 --> 01:23:38,433
Bad zombies! Shoo! Yah! Yah!

1246
01:23:39,108 --> 01:23:40,384
<i>He's losing it, Jack</i>

1247
01:23:40,384 --> 01:23:42,126
<i>Gee, you don't suppose</i>

1248
01:23:42,126 --> 01:23:45,021
<i>He's liable to crack
and spill all he knows</i>

1249
01:23:45,021 --> 01:23:48,044
<i>- He's really
- Acting weird?</i>

1250
01:23:48,044 --> 01:23:50,863
<i>Perhaps it's time he disappeared</i>

1251
01:23:50,863 --> 01:23:53,291
<i>He'd never be missed</i>

1252
01:23:53,291 --> 01:23:54,152
<i>I could</i>

1253
01:23:54,152 --> 01:23:56,867
<i>Murder him, murder him</i>

1254
01:23:56,867 --> 01:23:58,852
Jack, no! You fire
that bean-shooter,

1255
01:23:58,852 --> 01:24:00,238
You'll have the police
right back here.

1256
01:24:00,238 --> 01:24:03,492
All right, we'll play it
your way... for now.

1257
01:24:04,092 --> 01:24:04,921
Aah!

1258
01:24:04,921 --> 01:24:06,116
He bit me!

1259
01:24:06,116 --> 01:24:10,477
Jack, I got me
the munchies real bad.

1260
01:24:10,477 --> 01:24:13,290
He's giving me
the creepin' Heebie-Jeebies!

1261
01:24:13,290 --> 01:24:15,734
Come on, let's go
get Ralph a bite.

1262
01:24:15,734 --> 01:24:18,479
He's liable to wake the
neighbors with that racket.

1263
01:24:18,479 --> 01:24:21,368
You stay. Keep an eye on him.

1264
01:24:23,723 --> 01:24:25,930
I don't like the way
he's looking at me.

1265
01:24:29,029 --> 01:24:30,733
Shake a leg with that grub!

1266
01:24:30,733 --> 01:24:34,758
Leg... grub...

1267
01:24:34,758 --> 01:24:42,243
Aaaah!
Aaaaaaaaah!

1268
01:24:51,170 --> 01:24:52,406
Yoo-Hoo, Ralph!

1269
01:24:52,406 --> 01:24:54,484
We have Take-Away
from Dim Foo's!

1270
01:24:54,484 --> 01:24:56,624
Sally? Ralph?

1271
01:24:56,624 --> 01:24:57,857
Where'd they go?

1272
01:24:58,216 --> 01:25:00,029
They'd best not
have skipped town.

1273
01:25:00,029 --> 01:25:01,773
Sally! Ralph!

1274
01:25:06,731 --> 01:25:08,237
Yah!

1275
01:25:08,237 --> 01:25:11,057
Aah! Aaah!

1276
01:25:18,588 --> 01:25:19,149
Blumsack.

1277
01:25:26,166 --> 01:25:27,666
Aww.

1278
01:25:42,389 --> 01:25:44,957
<i>I found me a snack,
it was nice and fresh</i>

1279
01:25:45,025 --> 01:25:47,893
<i>The weed made him hungry
for human flesh</i>

1280
01:25:47,961 --> 01:25:49,995
<i>Step away, you mug</i>

1281
01:25:50,030 --> 01:25:53,566
<i>'Cause that's a brand-new
persian rug</i>

1282
01:25:53,633 --> 01:25:56,602
<i>He's not gonna stop</i>

1283
01:25:56,669 --> 01:25:59,405
<i>Murder him, murder him
murder him, murder him</i>

1284
01:25:59,473 --> 01:26:00,973
Hah!

1285
01:26:16,390 --> 01:26:18,090
Yah!

1286
01:26:18,158 --> 01:26:19,492
Oh!

1287
01:26:48,855 --> 01:26:52,090
Ralph...

1288
01:27:29,506 --> 01:27:32,582
Ha ha!

1289
01:27:37,137 --> 01:27:41,540
Oh, God. Oh, God.

1290
01:27:41,608 --> 01:27:44,676
Mae! Don't get queer
on me, now.

1291
01:27:54,120 --> 01:27:55,087
Ow.

1292
01:27:56,498 --> 01:27:58,566
Damn body.

1293
01:28:08,591 --> 01:28:11,016
<i>Open the gate
and abandon hope</i>

1294
01:28:11,016 --> 01:28:13,861
<i>With the ghosts of the kids
that got hooked on dope</i>

1295
01:28:14,007 --> 01:28:16,275
<i>Now I see them, Jack</i>

1296
01:28:16,342 --> 01:28:19,312
<i>And they all want
their childhoods back</i>

1297
01:28:19,379 --> 01:28:22,581
<i>We murdered them, Jack</i>

1298
01:28:22,649 --> 01:28:26,385
<i>Murdered them,
murdered them</i>

1299
01:28:26,453 --> 01:28:28,854
<i>Open the gate
and abandon hope</i>

1300
01:28:28,921 --> 01:28:32,325
<i>With the ghosts of the kids that
got hooked on dope</i> - Pull it together!

1301
01:28:32,392 --> 01:28:34,193
<i>- Now I see them, Jack?
- Don't flip your skirt</i>

1302
01:28:34,261 --> 01:28:36,562
<i>- You do the things you gotta do</i>

1303
01:28:36,629 --> 01:28:39,999
<i>- In this dog-Eat-Dog-Eat-Dog world
- They all want their childhoods back</i>

1304
01:28:40,066 --> 01:28:43,703
<i>We murdered them, Jack!</i>

1305
01:28:43,770 --> 01:28:45,438
<i>- So you murder them
- Survival of the fittest!</i>

1306
01:28:45,505 --> 01:28:47,840
<i>- Before they murder you
- Murdered them</i>

1307
01:28:47,907 --> 01:28:49,775
<i>- Murder, murder, murder
-  Murdered them! The winner is</i>

1308
01:28:49,842 --> 01:28:52,244
<i>- Murder, murder, murder
- The last one left</i>

1309
01:28:52,312 --> 01:28:58,884
<i>- Aahhhhh
- Aliiiiiiiiiiiiive!</i>

1310
01:29:16,278 --> 01:29:19,179
Well, on the bright side,

1311
01:29:19,247 --> 01:29:23,150
It looks like we finally got
the place to ourselves.

1312
01:29:26,422 --> 01:29:28,657
Ralph and Sally.

1313
01:29:28,724 --> 01:29:32,160
And little... What's-Her-Name
are dead!

1314
01:29:32,228 --> 01:29:34,162
Jimmy's on his way
to the electric chair,

1315
01:29:34,230 --> 01:29:36,064
And you couldn't care less!

1316
01:29:36,958 --> 01:29:39,552
I may be a monster,
but you, Jack...

1317
01:29:40,445 --> 01:29:42,079
You're the devil!

1318
01:29:44,306 --> 01:29:47,975
So long as I'm
the number-one guy.

1319
01:29:50,245 --> 01:29:52,080
<i>The kid's a goner</i>

1320
01:29:52,148 --> 01:29:56,253
<i>They're gonna make him pay</i>

1321
01:29:56,253 --> 01:29:57,924
<i>For the stuff</i>

1322
01:29:57,924 --> 01:30:01,059
Here. Simmer down, will ya?

1323
01:30:01,557 --> 01:30:04,625
<i>I've seen my honor</i>

1324
01:30:04,693 --> 01:30:08,329
<i>Rolled up and burnt away</i>

1325
01:30:08,397 --> 01:30:10,965
<i>With the stuff</i>

1326
01:30:11,033 --> 01:30:13,301
<i>Well, it's gotta stop</i>

1327
01:30:13,369 --> 01:30:15,370
Let go of me!

1328
01:30:15,438 --> 01:30:16,938
What? I'm trying
to comfort you here.

1329
01:30:17,006 --> 01:30:19,674
I said, let go!

1330
01:30:19,741 --> 01:30:23,110
<i>I should show him the door</i>

1331
01:30:23,178 --> 01:30:25,947
<i>He treats me like a whore</i>

1332
01:30:26,015 --> 01:30:29,117
<i>I don't need Jack no more</i>

1333
01:30:29,184 --> 01:30:32,687
<i>Or the stuff</i>

1334
01:30:36,158 --> 01:30:37,602
You dumb slut!

1335
01:30:37,602 --> 01:30:40,578
That was half a jay of good
mooter you just wasted.

1336
01:30:41,143 --> 01:30:43,476
I know.

1337
01:30:48,282 --> 01:30:51,231
Hey, what do you think
you're doing

1338
01:30:51,231 --> 01:30:52,343
With that garden hoe?

1339
01:30:52,920 --> 01:30:58,357
Taking care of a big, fat weed.

1340
01:30:59,559 --> 01:31:01,594
Oh, that's it.

1341
01:31:03,563 --> 01:31:05,064
Say "Goodnight," Gracie.

1342
01:31:11,071 --> 01:31:13,473
Goodnight, Gracie.

1343
01:31:15,643 --> 01:31:16,309
Oh!

1344
01:31:16,376 --> 01:31:18,177
<i>So, this is it, Jack</i>

1345
01:31:18,245 --> 01:31:21,681
<i>Last night of Ballyhoo</i>

1346
01:31:21,749 --> 01:31:22,916
<i>For the stuff</i>

1347
01:31:22,983 --> 01:31:25,385
Get away from me,
you crazy skirt!

1348
01:31:25,452 --> 01:31:28,238
<i>This one's for Ralph, Jack</i>

1349
01:31:28,273 --> 01:31:31,024
<i>Here's one for Sally, too</i>

1350
01:31:31,091 --> 01:31:32,225
<i>Had enough?</i>

1351
01:31:32,293 --> 01:31:34,628
<i>Yeah, you're not so tough</i>

1352
01:31:42,270 --> 01:31:45,138
<i>You once had all the brains</i>

1353
01:31:45,205 --> 01:31:48,842
<i>Now they're just carpet stains</i>

1354
01:31:48,909 --> 01:31:53,713
<i>You're in no shape to fight</i>

1355
01:31:53,780 --> 01:31:59,085
<i>My bid to make things right</i>

1356
01:31:59,486 --> 01:32:02,589
<i>'Cause there's blood upon your necktie</i>

1357
01:32:02,657 --> 01:32:04,790
<i>Your corpus is delecti</i>

1358
01:32:04,858 --> 01:32:09,863
<i>And I have been delivered</i>

1359
01:32:09,930 --> 01:32:21,827
<i>From the stuuuuuuuff</i>

1360
01:32:28,382 --> 01:32:30,116
Ohh.

1361
01:32:30,184 --> 01:32:32,785
Good lord, man.
You've sent Thelma into shock!

1362
01:32:32,853 --> 01:32:34,354
Your wife's lack of fortitude.

1363
01:32:34,421 --> 01:32:36,056
Is no fault
of this presentation.

1364
01:32:36,123 --> 01:32:38,391
I daresay our hardy
pioneer women.

1365
01:32:38,458 --> 01:32:40,760
Would have shared a good laugh
at her expense.

1366
01:32:40,828 --> 01:32:43,136
So, what of Mae Coleman?

1367
01:32:46,806 --> 01:32:48,007
With jack out of the picture,

1368
01:32:48,007 --> 01:32:51,677
Mae was determined to rescue
the seemingly doomed Jimmy.

1369
01:32:51,745 --> 01:32:56,248
But fate was about to intervene
in a most dramatic fashion.

1370
01:33:26,746 --> 01:33:28,146
<i>And from my vantage point,</i>

1371
01:33:28,181 --> 01:33:29,949
<i>I see the
presidential motorcade</i>

1372
01:33:30,017 --> 01:33:31,383
<i>Turning onto Halford Street.</i>

1373
01:33:31,451 --> 01:33:32,784
<i>The crowd is going wild!</i>

1374
01:33:34,254 --> 01:33:37,056
Mr. President! Mr. President!

1375
01:33:37,123 --> 01:33:38,991
Mr. President!

1376
01:33:39,059 --> 01:33:40,292
I need to talk with you.

1377
01:33:40,360 --> 01:33:41,627
Step back, ma'am.

1378
01:33:41,694 --> 01:33:43,095
But... But...

1379
01:33:46,166 --> 01:33:47,098
Hyah!

1380
01:33:47,166 --> 01:33:49,334
It is a known scientific fact.

1381
01:33:49,402 --> 01:33:51,637
That when under the influence
of marijuana,

1382
01:33:51,705 --> 01:33:53,973
The user becomes
insatiably violent.

1383
01:33:54,040 --> 01:33:57,276
And capable of staggering feats
of strength.

1384
01:33:57,344 --> 01:33:59,645
Unfortunately for Mae Coleman...

1385
01:34:01,847 --> 01:34:05,284
She was no longer
under the influence.

1386
01:34:05,352 --> 01:34:06,418
Ugh!

1387
01:34:06,486 --> 01:34:09,554
Oop! Aah. Mmmph.

1388
01:34:09,622 --> 01:34:12,224
Oh.

1389
01:34:14,679 --> 01:34:18,182
I'm... so terribly sorry.

1390
01:34:16,730 --> 01:34:18,897
I don't know what came over me.

1391
01:34:18,965 --> 01:34:20,298
Please, help me up.

1392
01:34:21,367 --> 01:34:21,968
Hyah!

1393
01:34:23,336 --> 01:34:24,636
Mr. President!

1394
01:34:24,704 --> 01:34:27,039
An innocent boy
is about to be executed!

1395
01:34:27,107 --> 01:34:29,342
Listen to me, please!

1396
01:34:34,025 --> 01:34:35,746
Hold on, boys!

1397
01:34:35,746 --> 01:34:37,981
I, for one, would like to hear

1398
01:34:37,984 --> 01:34:40,719
What the blood-spattered
young lady has to say.

1399
01:34:53,400 --> 01:34:55,867
James Fenimore Harper,

1400
01:34:55,935 --> 01:35:00,773
You have been convicted
of the murder of Mary Lane.

1401
01:35:00,840 --> 01:35:04,910
And sentenced to death
by electrocution.

1402
01:35:04,977 --> 01:35:10,382
In accordance with the laws
of this great state.

1403
01:35:10,450 --> 01:35:12,151
Any last words?

1404
01:35:12,219 --> 01:35:14,053
Huh...

1405
01:35:14,121 --> 01:35:15,053
Well-Put.

1406
01:35:15,121 --> 01:35:16,288
Pull the switch.

1407
01:35:23,497 --> 01:35:25,664
Stop the execution!

1408
01:35:26,566 --> 01:35:29,001
We have a presidential pardon!

1409
01:35:32,472 --> 01:35:35,774
Mae, am I ever glad to see you!

1410
01:35:35,842 --> 01:35:37,275
And you, too, Mr. President.

1411
01:35:37,343 --> 01:35:38,543
Ha ha ha!

1412
01:35:38,611 --> 01:35:41,179
I knew you wouldn't let me die!

1413
01:35:41,247 --> 01:35:42,581
Though I was kind of hoping.

1414
01:35:42,649 --> 01:35:44,516
You wouldn't cut it
quite so close.

1415
01:35:44,584 --> 01:35:46,251
I'm sorry, kid.

1416
01:35:46,319 --> 01:35:49,021
But now we're gonna be okay!

1417
01:35:49,089 --> 01:35:52,191
So, Jimmy,
I've heard a lot about you.

1418
01:35:52,258 --> 01:35:55,060
Oh, and we've read about you
in school, Mr. President.

1419
01:35:55,128 --> 01:35:57,462
Thank you so much for coming!

1420
01:35:57,530 --> 01:36:01,667
I promise never to touch
the reefer again.

1421
01:36:01,735 --> 01:36:04,703
Oh, that is simply grand.

1422
01:36:04,771 --> 01:36:08,473
You know, a little orphan girl
once told me

1423
01:36:08,541 --> 01:36:11,297
That the sun would come out
tomorrow.

1424
01:36:11,297 --> 01:36:14,546
Her adopted father was
a powerful billionaire,

1425
01:36:14,546 --> 01:36:17,610
So I suppressed the urge
to laugh in her face.

1426
01:36:17,610 --> 01:36:21,714
But now, I think she might have
been on to something!

1427
01:36:29,148 --> 01:36:33,028
<i>The tragic victim of drug abuse</i>

1428
01:36:33,028 --> 01:36:37,682
<i>Has now been spared for a higher use</i>

1429
01:36:37,682 --> 01:36:41,526
<i>They were ready to cook my goose</i>

1430
01:36:41,526 --> 01:36:45,787
<i>But God had other plans</i>

1431
01:36:45,787 --> 01:36:47,996
He works in mysterious ways, Jimmy.

1432
01:36:48,695 --> 01:36:52,458
<i>I feel like something inside has stirred</i>

1433
01:36:52,758 --> 01:36:57,788
<i>At long, long last may the truth be heard</i>

1434
01:36:57,788 --> 01:37:01,350
Go forth, Jimmy, and spread the word!

1435
01:37:01,350 --> 01:37:07,471
<i>- From sea to shining sea</i>
- You have been set free
