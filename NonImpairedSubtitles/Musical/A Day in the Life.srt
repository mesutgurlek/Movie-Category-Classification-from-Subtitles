00:00:32,040 --> 00:00:34,191
Yo, cuz, open that door.

2
00:00:34,240 --> 00:00:36,152
I got to get some sleep.

3
00:00:36,200 --> 00:00:39,079
Oh, shit. Yo, son, it's the fucking police.

4
00:00:39,120 --> 00:00:41,191
- Fuck you talkin' about?
- They're here, right outside of the house.

5
00:00:41,240 --> 00:00:44,119
All right, all right, all right, chill.
Put that 1 up under the couch.

6
00:00:44,160 --> 00:00:45,150
You want to hear 'em say "Police,"  bitch?

7
00:00:45,200 --> 00:00:47,078
- Put that weed out.
- All right.

8
00:00:47,080 --> 00:00:49,037
Fucking hard-head bitch,

9
00:00:49,080 --> 00:00:50,116
- We should get the fuck out.
- Yo, chill.

10
00:00:50,160 --> 00:00:51,196
- It's probably nothing.
- Then why they came?

11
00:00:51,240 --> 00:00:53,232
Like I said, it's probably nothing
but a noise complaint.

12
00:00:54,040 --> 00:00:56,236
Bitch here blasting music
like she ain't got no senses.

13
00:00:56,240 --> 00:00:57,993
Fuck you, nigga.

How can I help you brothers out?

18
00:01:04,160 --> 00:01:06,152
Yeah, we need to speak

19
00:01:06,160 --> 00:01:08,197
Oh, yeah, that's me, what's up?

36
00:01:40,240 --> 00:01:42,072
We ain't got nothin'

Yo, yo, yo, run to the closet, man,

You think there's enough time for me

00:01:59,160 --> 00:02:02,039
What? No, man, run outside,

You should've killed me, cuz

49
00:04:07,240 --> 00:04:09,038
Remember when I first met you?

50
00:04:09,080 --> 00:04:10,196
You ain't even holla back

51
00:04:10,200 --> 00:04:11,998
Because you was trying to impress me

52
00:04:12,080 --> 00:04:13,116
With your dollar stacks

53
00:04:13,160 --> 00:04:15,072
Talk about you buy me
Gucci this and Prada that

54
00:04:15,120 --> 00:04:18,079
Anything it take to get you up out of that

55
00:04:18,080 --> 00:04:20,151
See, I knew it, you was
just in it for the sex

56
00:04:20,200 --> 00:04:22,192
Can you blame me?
Damn, girl, you know you the best

57
00:04:22,240 --> 00:04:23,230
- Whatever

58
00:04:23,240 --> 00:04:25,152
I just want to hit from the start

59
00:04:25,200 --> 00:04:27,112
But when I got to know you,
fell in love, you stole my heart

60
00:04:27,120 --> 00:04:30,033
When I look at you,
you know what I see?

61
00:04:30,080 --> 00:04:32,117
It's crazy, you're sort of
like the female me

62
00:04:32,160 --> 00:04:34,231
I think I'm lovesick,
and that can't be healthy

63
00:04:35,040 --> 00:04:37,157
Oh, my God, somebody
please help me

64
00:04:37,200 --> 00:04:39,237
Now, I'm serious, ma, I live for you

65
00:04:40,040 --> 00:04:42,077
We'll get married one day,
have a kid or two

66
00:04:42,080 --> 00:04:44,072
But I don't know if
I can live in the same crib with you

67
00:04:44,120 --> 00:04:45,110
What you talkin' about?

68
00:04:45,160 --> 00:04:47,072
No, I'm just kidding with you

69
00:04:47,120 --> 00:04:49,191
You know I need you by my side
in everything that I do

70
00:04:49,240 --> 00:04:52,074
Who else on this whole planet

71
00:04:52,080 --> 00:04:54,151
If you doubt me, ma,
you better believe it's true

72
00:04:54,200 --> 00:04:57,034
Let's move to another country,

73
00:05:36,200 --> 00:05:39,079

00:05:49,040 --> 00:05:51,077
This bitch had the best
pussy that I ever had

81
00:05:51,120 --> 00:05:53,999
I mean, the shit was so wet, son,

82
00:05:54,040 --> 00:05:56,032
- Say, word

83
00:05:56,080 --> 00:05:58,037
She was feelin' me,

84
00:05:58,040 --> 00:05:59,076
I think I'm in love

85
00:05:59,120 --> 00:06:00,236
- Yo, don't even say no more
- What?

86
00:06:01,040 --> 00:06:03,032
You're sayin' the same old shit

00:06:03,040 --> 00:06:05,236
Nah, nah, son, trust me,

00:06:06,000 --> 00:06:08,993
The pussy don't even got

89
00:06:09,040 --> 00:06:10,030
Oh, oh, you ate that bitch?

00:06:10,080 --> 00:06:12,037

00:06:13,240 --> 00:06:15,118
Don't be calling my bitch no bitch

93
00:06:15,120 --> 00:06:17,077
Nigga, reach in the ashtray
and get that clip

94
00:06:17,120 --> 00:06:18,110
You ain't no pimp

95
00:06:18,160 --> 00:06:20,072
Nigga, I'm a pimp, but I like that bitch

96
00:06:20,080 --> 00:06:22,072
You just ran a light,

97
00:06:22,120 --> 00:06:24,191
Nah, they suspending my shit,

But fuck it, it ain't a crime
unless you get caught

99
00:06:27,120 --> 00:06:29,157
I feel you, nigga, that's what I'm sayin'

100
00:06:29,200 --> 00:06:31,192
Shorty bad, but you really ate her, son?

106
00:06:43,000 --> 00:06:45,117
The whole hood's sayin'

107
00:06:45,200 --> 00:06:47,157
Can't believe this can happen

108
00:06:47,200 --> 00:06:50,079
So I keep it in the head for these

You ain't get those fucking messages

00:07:15,160 --> 00:07:17,117
No, the cell battery dead,

00:07:17,160 --> 00:07:18,196
Why, what happened, nigga?

We was at the club
and niggas started clapping

00:07:20,200 --> 00:07:22,192
The same bitch-ass niggas

His name is Papa Shit

133
00:07:40,040 --> 00:07:42,077
Police and the bouncers

134
00:07:42,080 --> 00:07:43,196

Well, where y'all at?

All over the place

139

You think the fucking cops

Yo, this ain't your cousin no more

227
00:11:30,240 --> 00:11:32,152
- Just put down your gun

228
00:11:32,160 --> 00:11:34,117
- You put down your gun

229
00:11:34,160 --> 00:11:35,230

All right, that's your life, nigga,

236
00:11:48,200 --> 00:11:50,078
We finished trying to kill each other?

237
00:11:50,120 --> 00:11:51,998
Could we drop that shit
and put some focus

238
00:11:52,040 --> 00:11:53,156
On these niggas
that robbed our shit?

239
00:11:53,160 --> 00:11:56,039
Hey, yo, I know where they be,

240
00:11:56,080 --> 00:11:58,197
If we leave now, we can hit 'em up
in broad day

241
00:11:58,240 --> 00:12:01,074
All right, but first we got to plan it out,

242
00:12:01,120 --> 00:12:04,113
Do this shit right, niggas won't even

243
00:12:14,080 --> 00:12:15,230
Right out there, right out there.

244
00:12:18,200 --> 00:12:19,236

Fuck! Shit!

There they go right there,

00:13:17,040 --> 00:13:19,077
Better be, know they

252
00:13:19,120 --> 00:13:21,032
We ain't walking away,

253
00:13:21,080 --> 00:13:22,196
Fuck that, pull in the street

00:13:22,200 --> 00:13:24,078
Let's start the show, my heart racing

00:13:24,120 --> 00:13:25,156
Way to get it poppin', yo

Hey, yo, what up, nigga?
We got a message for you

257
00:13:28,160 --> 00:13:29,150
Hey, you know them niggas?

00:13:29,200 --> 00:13:30,190
You got that thing on you?

00:13:30,200 --> 00:13:31,190
Just a four-fifth

260

That's an automatic, dawg, fuck

264
00:13:37,200 --> 00:13:40,034
I got a Tec and a pump
if we can get to my trunk

265
00:13:40,120 --> 00:13:43,033
We'd be shred to bits
trying to make the keys fit

266
00:13:43,040 --> 00:13:45,032
I saywe hop in the car
and make a break for it

267
00:13:45,080 --> 00:13:46,230
I'm telling you,

268
00:13:46,240 --> 00:13:48,072
No, it's just too dangerous

269
00:13:48,120 --> 00:13:50,112
Let's make a dash

270
00:13:50,160 --> 00:13:52,231
Got 'em where we want 'em,
only one of 'em got a gun

271
00:13:53,040 --> 00:13:56,033
Get in the truck, nigga follow them,

- All right.

274
00:14:00,200 --> 00:14:03,113
Yo, son, watch out

275
00:14:03,160 --> 00:14:05,994
You crazy? You just

276
00:14:06,040 --> 00:14:07,190
I don't care,

277
00:14:07,240 --> 00:14:09,197
Shit come in three, homie,

278
00:14:09,200 --> 00:14:12,159
Jesus Christ, oh, my God, nigga,

279
00:14:12,200 --> 00:14:14,999

281
00:14:17,200 --> 00:14:19,112
I got an idea, we've

282
00:14:19,160 --> 00:14:20,150
What the fuck these cats up to?

283
00:14:20,200 --> 00:14:22,032
What the fuck are they doing?

284
00:14:22,080 --> 00:14:23,036
They headed for the train tracks

285
00:14:23,080 --> 00:14:24,196
So you better not lose them

286

- Man, you got it?

291
00:14:33,200 --> 00:14:36,034
Yeah, they're going

292
00:15:17,040 --> 00:15:19,157
Bad news, boss,

You're not gonna believe

One of them tried to holla at me
so I gave him the digits

303
00:15:42,040 --> 00:15:44,236
He called, I came to kick it
one night at his spot

304
00:15:45,000 --> 00:15:47,151
Checking him out, seemed
like theywere setting up shop

305
00:15:47,200 --> 00:15:49,157
Theywas moving weight
through a fake record company

306
00:15:49,200 --> 00:15:51,999
Selling guns, coke,
Ecstasy, whatever you need

307
00:15:52,040 --> 00:15:53,110
So theywas selling raw

308
00:15:53,160 --> 00:15:55,072
How you know it was them for sure?

309
00:15:55,080 --> 00:15:57,151
B- B-Boss, me not done
talking, there's more

310
00:15:57,200 --> 00:16:00,113
I thought he stood me up 'cause last time
I ain't give him no ass

311
00:16:00,160 --> 00:16:01,150
And he called today and said

312
00:16:01,200 --> 00:16:03,032
Two of his boys got blast

313
00:16:03,040 --> 00:16:05,111
Now they out for revenge,
somebody stole their cheddar

314
00:16:05,160 --> 00:16:07,994
When you brought it up,
I put and together

315
00:16:08,040 --> 00:16:10,191
Who the fuck do these little niggas
think they is?

316
00:16:10,240 --> 00:16:13,074
They can kill my men
and take my shit?

317
00:16:13,120 --> 00:16:15,157
No problem, boss,
tomorrow we gun them down

318
00:16:15,160 --> 00:16:18,119
No, I want them dead
before the sun goes down

319
00:16:28,080 --> 00:16:30,151
It's one of Black's boys,
said he want to holla at Stick

320
00:16:30,200 --> 00:16:34,080
What? Give me the phone,
let me holla at this kid

321
00:16:34,120 --> 00:16:36,077
Yo, what's poppin'?

322
00:16:36,120 --> 00:16:38,237
My boss don't want a war,
I'm offerin' to resolve the conflict

323
00:16:38,240 --> 00:16:41,119
So meet me on the I-4
behind the projects

324
00:16:41,160 --> 00:16:43,994
Get the beef, I'll make a deal,
and both make a profit

325
00:16:44,080 --> 00:16:45,116
What happened, what'd he say?

326
00:16:45,120 --> 00:16:46,156
I guess he came to his senses

327
00:16:46,200 --> 00:16:49,193
He heard about the scene,
now he want to do business

328
00:16:49,240 --> 00:16:51,197
Word? Want me to call that nigga Stick?

329
00:16:51,200 --> 00:16:53,192
Nah, he with his bitch,
yo, let's handle this shit

330
00:16:53,240 --> 00:16:56,039
- All right.
- Come on.

331
00:17:07,040 --> 00:17:08,076
- There he go
- Where?

332
00:17:08,160 --> 00:17:10,117
- There's that bastard now
- Oh, I see him

333
00:17:10,160 --> 00:17:12,197
Bet he know who did them
drug hits that went down

334
00:17:12,240 --> 00:17:14,994
But how do you know he's gonna
turn a snitch and rat them out?

335
00:17:15,040 --> 00:17:17,157
nigga, let me worry about that shit,
you just back him down

336
00:17:17,200 --> 00:17:19,032
- Wait, wait, wait
- What?

337
00:17:19,040 --> 00:17:20,190
- Let me get a little closer
- Relax, dude

338
00:17:20,240 --> 00:17:23,039
Because if he run, I'm gonna run
his black ass over

339
00:17:23,080 --> 00:17:24,116
I ain't playing with these punks

340
00:17:24,160 --> 00:17:25,196
Don't you think that's kind of harsh?

341
00:17:25,240 --> 00:17:28,119
Man, cuz, lucky his ass ain't behind bars

342
00:17:28,200 --> 00:17:30,112
Hey, hey, homie, don't run

343
00:17:30,160 --> 00:17:32,072
You ain't that fast, trust me, nigga

344
00:17:32,080 --> 00:17:33,196
I'll shoot you in your motherfucking ass

345
00:17:33,240 --> 00:17:36,153
What you want from me, man?
I ain't do nothin'

346
00:17:36,160 --> 00:17:37,150
Aw, shut up, nigga

347
00:17:37,200 --> 00:17:38,998
Before I take you in for nothin'

348
00:17:39,040 --> 00:17:40,156
Now listen, I need some answers

349
00:17:40,200 --> 00:17:42,032
- And I know you got 'em
- What?

350
00:17:42,080 --> 00:17:44,037
About that hit that
took place up at Sunset Plaza

351
00:17:44,080 --> 00:17:45,116
I don't know about that shit

352
00:17:45,160 --> 00:17:47,117
There were several other hits
all drug related

353
00:17:47,160 --> 00:17:49,038
- Connection is-
- They used the same guns in all the cases

354
00:17:49,080 --> 00:17:50,150
I told you, I don't know nothing

355
00:17:50,200 --> 00:17:52,112
Damn, man, let go of my head

356
00:17:52,200 --> 00:17:54,192
I swear, I been clean
since I got out of the fed's

357
00:17:54,200 --> 00:17:57,159
- Oh, yeah? Tell that shit to somebody else
- What?

358
00:17:57,200 --> 00:18:00,034
Give me a name, give me a name, cuz,
or you back in the cell

359
00:18:00,040 --> 00:18:01,997
Man, fuck you, pig,
you ain't got nothing on me

360
00:18:02,080 --> 00:18:03,070
You know you fucked up, right?

361
00:18:03,120 --> 00:18:05,112
Take me in,
put the cuffs on me, nigga

362
00:18:05,160 --> 00:18:08,039
Okay, but when I take you
down to the station

363
00:18:08,080 --> 00:18:09,070
This gun with your fingerprints

364
00:18:09,120 --> 00:18:11,032
Violates your probation

365
00:18:11,080 --> 00:18:12,196
What? You planted that shit, nigga

366
00:18:12,240 --> 00:18:14,232
- Yeah, and the drugs
- Yo, you can't do this, man

367
00:18:14,240 --> 00:18:16,152
Well, tell it to the judge

368
00:18:16,200 --> 00:18:19,113
Okay, okay, let me go, and I swear

369
00:18:19,200 --> 00:18:22,079
- I'll tell you everything I know
- I'm listening

370
00:18:42,120 --> 00:18:44,999
Man, you almost broke that guy's arm
right outside in the street

371
00:18:45,040 --> 00:18:47,999
We can do what the fuck we want to do,
nigga, we the fucking police

372
00:18:48,040 --> 00:18:50,077
I don't know, man,
what if there's an eyewitness?

373
00:18:50,120 --> 00:18:52,999
Look, nigga, you got to show these niggas
you mean business

374
00:18:53,040 --> 00:18:54,110
Can you stop saying that word?

375
00:18:54,160 --> 00:18:56,152
- nigga, what word?
- The N word

376
00:18:56,200 --> 00:18:57,998
The N - what, nigga?

377
00:18:58,040 --> 00:19:00,999
- Yes
- Oh, my nigga, my bad

378
00:19:01,040 --> 00:19:03,157
I just figured, you know,
you know, you my nigga

379
00:19:03,200 --> 00:19:05,078
Look, man, I told you

380
00:19:05,080 --> 00:19:06,150
And I'm not gonna
tell you no more

381
00:19:06,200 --> 00:19:08,192
All right, nigga, look,
let's just get in the car

382
00:19:08,240 --> 00:19:11,039
Follow this lead,
and give this nigga Sticky a call

383
00:19:11,080 --> 00:19:13,197
Hey, yo, yo, seriously,
stop saying that shit

384
00:19:13,240 --> 00:19:15,038
All right, nigga, why you trippin'?

385
00:19:30,040 --> 00:19:32,157
How you go and get up
and let me sleep like that?

386
00:19:32,200 --> 00:19:34,157
You got my note?
See, I told you, I'll be right back

387
00:19:34,160 --> 00:19:36,117
But you ain't even say goodbye

388
00:19:36,160 --> 00:19:38,152
- Yeah, but I kissed you
- That's right

389
00:19:38,200 --> 00:19:40,078
You're back now, I missed you

390
00:19:40,120 --> 00:19:41,156
I missed you, too

391
00:19:41,200 --> 00:19:42,236
Especially your eyes

392
00:19:42,240 --> 00:19:44,038
Now close them, and don't peek

393
00:19:44,080 --> 00:19:45,116
I got you a surprise

394
00:19:45,160 --> 00:19:46,150
Okay

395
00:19:46,160 --> 00:19:47,196
Now open your mouth

396
00:19:47,240 --> 00:19:49,038
That's a good girl

397
00:19:49,080 --> 00:19:51,151
Now stick your tongue out

398
00:19:51,200 --> 00:19:52,236
Tell me, what do you taste?

399
00:19:54,080 --> 00:19:56,037
Taste like grapes

400
00:19:56,080 --> 00:19:58,993
Damn, you so extraordinary

401
00:19:59,040 --> 00:20:01,077
- What's that?
- Strawberry?

402
00:20:01,120 --> 00:20:02,156
You want some more?

403
00:20:04,000 --> 00:20:04,990
What's the magic word?

404
00:20:05,040 --> 00:20:07,032
Please?

405
00:20:07,120 --> 00:20:08,156
What is this?

406
00:20:10,000 --> 00:20:12,037
Cheese

407
00:20:13,160 --> 00:20:14,196
Something ain't right

408
00:20:14,240 --> 00:20:16,038
Something feels strange

409
00:20:16,080 --> 00:20:18,197
Excuse me, one of you
got some spare change?

410
00:20:18,200 --> 00:20:20,237
Get the fuck out of here,
man, I ain't got nothing for you

411
00:20:21,000 --> 00:20:23,196
God damn, my nigga,
just trying to get some food

412
00:20:23,240 --> 00:20:26,039
I said get the fuck out of here,
you fucking retarded?

413
00:20:26,040 --> 00:20:28,157
All right, all right,
I ain't trying to get you started

414
00:20:28,200 --> 00:20:29,236
Yo, nigga, what's up with you

415
00:20:29,240 --> 00:20:30,993
Fucking with these bums and shit?

416
00:20:31,040 --> 00:20:32,156
Hey, yo, pussy

417
00:20:32,200 --> 00:20:34,032
Black's up for sucking dick

418
00:20:34,080 --> 00:20:36,117
- Oh, shit
- Shit, fuck, yo, I'm hit

419
00:20:36,160 --> 00:20:39,153
But the boywas dead
if you taste Black shit

420
00:20:39,200 --> 00:20:43,080
If I'm leaving this bitch,
I ain't leaving empty

421
00:20:43,120 --> 00:20:45,112
You're going to hell with me

422
00:20:45,160 --> 00:20:46,196
You like that shit?

423
00:20:46,200 --> 00:20:47,156
Yeah, baby

424
00:20:49,200 --> 00:20:50,236
- Don't stop
- Okay

425
00:20:50,240 --> 00:20:53,039
Wrap your arms around my neck

426
00:20:53,080 --> 00:20:54,992
Let me lift you up, that's right

427
00:20:55,040 --> 00:20:56,997
Throw it on me, mommy,
throw that shit

428
00:20:58,160 --> 00:20:59,150
That's it

429
00:20:59,200 --> 00:21:00,236
You feel that?

430
00:21:00,240 --> 00:21:03,074
I feel it in my stomach, don't stop

431
00:21:03,160 --> 00:21:05,038
I'm coming

432
00:21:09,200 --> 00:21:12,193
Hey, hey, what's up? It ain't over

433
00:21:12,240 --> 00:21:14,232
Aah, shit, caught me

434
00:21:14,240 --> 00:21:17,074
That's right, bitch,

435
00:21:17,120 --> 00:21:20,079
Where you goin, nigga?
Come back and play

436
00:21:20,120 --> 00:21:21,190
Faster, harder

437
00:21:21,240 --> 00:21:24,199
Fuck me, slap my ass

438
00:21:24,240 --> 00:21:29,076
- Say you want it
- I want it

439
00:21:29,120 --> 00:21:31,112
Hold the fuck on,
I'm fucking coming

440
00:21:42,040 --> 00:21:45,238
I got your bitch, nigga

441
00:21:45,240 --> 00:21:48,074
Yeah, who's the bitch, nigga?

442
00:21:48,160 --> 00:21:50,197
I got your bitch, nigga

443
00:21:50,200 --> 00:21:52,112
What?

444
00:22:00,040 --> 00:22:03,078
You gonna be okay, as God is mywitness

445
00:22:03,120 --> 00:22:05,157
Just tell me who, son,
tell me who did this

446
00:22:05,200 --> 00:22:08,034
Talk to me, nigga,
come on, man, I'm right here

447
00:22:08,080 --> 00:22:10,037
I'm sorry, sir,
only doctors are allowed back here

448
00:22:10,080 --> 00:22:12,151
What? Fuck that, my cousin's shot up
and about to die

449
00:22:12,200 --> 00:22:15,113
You're gonna have to calm down, sir,
or go outside

450
00:22:15,160 --> 00:22:17,231
I ain't fucking going nowhere
till they examine him

451
00:22:18,040 --> 00:22:20,111
Sir, please, they're doing
everything they can for him

452
00:22:20,160 --> 00:22:22,152
- I know you're upset
- You'd be too, if you was me

453
00:22:22,200 --> 00:22:23,998
You want to help

454
00:22:24,040 --> 00:22:26,032
The best thing
you can do is take a seat

455
00:22:26,080 --> 00:22:27,992
Fuck, I don't believe this shit

456
00:22:28,040 --> 00:22:30,157
It's all right, I'll cool him down,
ma, you can split

457
00:22:30,240 --> 00:22:33,119
Son, I swear, everything's sacred

458
00:22:33,120 --> 00:22:35,999
nigga's gonna die
if my nigga don't make it

459
00:22:36,040 --> 00:22:38,032
Fuck that, niggas dying
even if he do make it

460
00:22:38,080 --> 00:22:39,230
Word.

461
00:22:49,160 --> 00:22:51,152
- How is he, doc?
- A bullet dislocated his shoulder

462
00:22:51,160 --> 00:22:53,072
- But it went right through
- Word?

463
00:22:53,120 --> 00:22:55,077
One shattered his lung,
which we just removed

464
00:22:55,120 --> 00:22:58,033
If you didn't get him here so quick,
he might not have survived

465
00:22:58,080 --> 00:23:00,197
So many arteries got hit,
he's lucky to be alive

466
00:23:00,240 --> 00:23:03,074
It's major internal bleeding
from a wound by his navel

467
00:23:03,080 --> 00:23:05,072
He's in critical condition,
but for now he's stable

468
00:23:05,080 --> 00:23:06,116
Is he conscious?
Could we see him?

469
00:23:06,160 --> 00:23:08,072
- Yeah, but no conversation
- All right

470
00:23:08,120 --> 00:23:10,077
His heart rate is low
and under heavy observation

471
00:23:10,080 --> 00:23:12,037
All right

472
00:23:12,080 --> 00:23:13,070
Aw, shit, man

473
00:23:15,040 --> 00:23:17,999
Damn, so why you in the streets
without the clique?

474
00:23:18,040 --> 00:23:20,111
Knowin' this drama,
knowing we at war and shit

475
00:23:20,160 --> 00:23:23,039
I know you hear me, who did this?
Give me a sign

476
00:23:23,080 --> 00:23:25,151
All this sitting around waiting,
fucking losing my mind

477
00:23:25,200 --> 00:23:28,034
We got to get back at them

478
00:23:28,080 --> 00:23:30,151
You ain't gotta tell me,
I know that it was Black and them

479
00:23:30,160 --> 00:23:31,992
niggas is dead, man

480
00:23:32,040 --> 00:23:34,032
niggas is fucking dead, man

481
00:23:55,040 --> 00:23:56,190
Come on, girl,
answer the damn phone

482
00:23:56,240 --> 00:23:57,230
Hello?

483
00:23:57,240 --> 00:23:59,118
Hello, Heaven?

484
00:23:59,160 --> 00:24:01,072
Stick, is that you?

485
00:24:01,120 --> 00:24:03,077
Yeah, yeah, it's me

486
00:24:03,160 --> 00:24:04,230
Baby, are you okay?

487
00:24:05,000 --> 00:24:06,195
You had me worried,
the way you ran out the door

488
00:24:07,000 --> 00:24:08,070
Yeah, yeah, I'm fine

489
00:24:08,120 --> 00:24:10,077
Are you sure?

490
00:24:10,160 --> 00:24:12,197
Yeah, it's just lately,
I've been through a lot

491
00:24:12,200 --> 00:24:14,032
I'm at the hospital right now

492
00:24:14,080 --> 00:24:17,073
- My cousin got shot
- Oh, my God, is he okay?

493
00:24:17,080 --> 00:24:19,197
He was critical, now he's stable,
but it's hard to say

494
00:24:19,240 --> 00:24:22,074
I'm so sorry, where are you?
I'm on myway

495
00:24:22,120 --> 00:24:24,237
No, don't, there's more
things I got to handle today

496
00:24:25,000 --> 00:24:26,070
I could be there in a hot second

497
00:24:26,120 --> 00:24:28,112
- I'm already out the door
- No, don't

498
00:24:28,160 --> 00:24:30,072
- You sure?
- Yeah, yeah, I'm sure

499
00:24:30,080 --> 00:24:32,197
Baby, promise me right now
you'll leave it up to the law

500
00:24:32,240 --> 00:24:34,232
And won't go out looking for blood,
trying to even the score

501
00:24:34,240 --> 00:24:37,199
Look, my cousin will lose everything
without my help

502
00:24:37,240 --> 00:24:40,039
There's a lot of things
I ain't tell you about myself

503
00:24:40,080 --> 00:24:42,151
I don't care, I just want you to
come back in one piece

504
00:24:42,160 --> 00:24:45,073
- I want to pack up all our bags and leave
- Listen

505
00:25:05,120 --> 00:25:07,032
What I'm supposed to do
you end up a dead man?

506
00:25:07,120 --> 00:25:08,236
I'm not gonna end up a dead man

507
00:25:08,240 --> 00:25:11,039
I was gonna wait to tell you,
but, Stick, I'm pregnant

508
00:25:11,080 --> 00:25:13,117
What? You're pregnant?

509
00:25:13,120 --> 00:25:15,237
Yeah, I swear on my holy father in heaven

510
00:25:16,040 --> 00:25:17,190
Well, when did you find out, girl?

511
00:25:17,200 --> 00:25:18,190
Why you ain't tell me?

512
00:25:18,240 --> 00:25:20,197
I just had a check-up yesterday

513
00:25:20,240 --> 00:25:22,152
- It's growing, it's healthy
- Oh, shit

514
00:25:22,200 --> 00:25:24,157
- So I'm gonna be a father?
- Yeah

515
00:25:24,200 --> 00:25:27,034
All right, all right, all right,
I got to work smarter

516
00:25:27,040 --> 00:25:29,032
- I think you right, we should burst tonight
- Yeah?

517
00:25:29,080 --> 00:25:31,072
I'll come over, we get us passports,
reserve some flights

518
00:25:31,120 --> 00:25:33,237
Are you for real? I'll be the happiest
woman on earth

519
00:25:33,240 --> 00:25:36,119
I'm dead serious, got to take care
of one thing first

520
00:25:36,160 --> 00:25:39,039
No, don't do it, please,
I got a bad feeling

521
00:25:39,080 --> 00:25:41,117
But I got to, if I don't,
I could lose all we built

522
00:25:41,120 --> 00:25:43,999
I just want peace,
I'm not into all the crazy drama

523
00:25:44,040 --> 00:25:45,997
- I know, ma
- I'm not trying to raise a kid alone

524
00:25:46,040 --> 00:25:47,110
- I'll be a baby mama
- I know

525
00:26:30,160 --> 00:26:31,992
What happened
to the 5:30 reservation?

526
00:26:32,040 --> 00:26:33,110
I don't know, I guess they're late

527
00:26:33,160 --> 00:26:35,231
What up with table number 5
yo, you taking their plate?

528
00:26:36,000 --> 00:26:38,117
It's not ready, still waiting
for the patties to bake

529
00:26:38,160 --> 00:26:41,039
Well, I don't like you standing around,
just not doing nothin'

530
00:26:41,080 --> 00:26:42,150
I pay you to work, boy

531
00:26:42,200 --> 00:26:43,236
Go do something

532
00:26:43,240 --> 00:26:46,039
Oh, shit, is that
my nigga Stick coming?

533
00:26:46,080 --> 00:26:48,231
That's a Hummer, though,
what happened to the 600?

534
00:26:49,000 --> 00:26:51,037
Hey, yo, what up, dawg?
It's been a minute

535
00:26:51,080 --> 00:26:52,150
Well, what you want me to do?

536
00:26:52,200 --> 00:26:53,236
I don't know, go do the dishes

537
00:26:53,240 --> 00:26:56,039
Kids, try to teach 'em,
but they never listen

538
00:26:56,120 --> 00:26:59,192
Let's go out to the front,
puff one, kick it

539
00:27:01,040 --> 00:27:03,236
Excuse me, can you tell me
where's the restroom?

540
00:27:03,240 --> 00:27:06,074
Yeah, it's right over there,
you enjoying your food?

541
00:27:06,120 --> 00:27:07,190
Yes, thank you, it's wonderful

542
00:27:07,240 --> 00:27:09,197
Good, good

543
00:27:09,240 --> 00:27:11,994
Yo, yo, bring us some drinks

544
00:27:15,120 --> 00:27:16,998
So what up with you, dawg?

545
00:27:17,040 --> 00:27:19,111
It ain't nothing, I'm chillin'

546
00:27:19,160 --> 00:27:21,072
That's not what I heard,
I heard you was illin'

547
00:27:21,120 --> 00:27:23,032
I heard you was mashing them out,
blasting them out

548
00:27:23,080 --> 00:27:26,073
I like the way you move,
homie, y'all casting a towel

549
00:27:26,120 --> 00:27:27,156
Their ass is out

550
00:27:27,200 --> 00:27:28,190
Like how you handle the biz

551
00:27:28,240 --> 00:27:30,038
Got to know when to cash out

552
00:27:30,080 --> 00:27:32,037
We're gambling, kid,
what up with your girl?

553
00:27:32,040 --> 00:27:33,235
- My girl told me y'all was expecting
- Yeah.

554
00:27:33,240 --> 00:27:36,039
You don't want to give birth to them
when you're dead

555
00:27:36,080 --> 00:27:38,072
Man, fuck you, who the fuck
is you to critique?

556
00:27:38,080 --> 00:27:40,197
I know you double-OG,
but I ain't new to these streets

557
00:27:40,240 --> 00:27:41,993
I'm not saying you are

558
00:27:42,040 --> 00:27:43,190
It's just the way
you playing your cards

559
00:27:43,240 --> 00:27:45,197
How you swimming with the sharks
but ain't weighing the odds?

560
00:27:45,200 --> 00:27:47,032
That's what I'm sayin', it's hard

561
00:27:47,080 --> 00:27:48,150
They the ones that came at us first

562
00:27:48,200 --> 00:27:50,157
I had to clap back, man,
you know how the streets work

563
00:27:50,200 --> 00:27:51,998
They forced my hand

564
00:27:52,040 --> 00:27:53,190
Thinkin' they could clap on my cuz

565
00:27:53,240 --> 00:27:55,038
Then they ran up in a spot

566
00:27:55,040 --> 00:27:56,110
And took the cash and the drugs

567
00:27:56,160 --> 00:27:57,150
Now we at war

568
00:27:57,160 --> 00:27:58,196
Dawg, I need some advice

569
00:27:59,000 --> 00:28:01,071
Dawg, listen to wifey,
take heed for her life, see?

570
00:28:01,120 --> 00:28:03,077
See, I'm knowin' your pain,
it's all in the game

571
00:28:03,120 --> 00:28:05,032
You don't deserve to be stressed out

572
00:28:05,080 --> 00:28:07,037
Callin' your name,
but that's where it leads

573
00:28:07,040 --> 00:28:08,235
- niggas bleed for dastardly deeds
- I know.

574
00:28:09,000 --> 00:28:09,990
You got the chance to be the father

575
00:28:10,080 --> 00:28:11,070
To the bastard in me

576
00:28:11,120 --> 00:28:12,156
I hear you, nigga

577
00:28:12,200 --> 00:28:13,998
Believe me, I feel you, nigga

578
00:28:14,040 --> 00:28:15,235
But before I leave town,
I got to kill these niggas

579
00:28:16,000 --> 00:28:18,117
Dawg, you needed your dreams,
Why, when you were here to the scheme?

580
00:28:18,160 --> 00:28:21,073
- 'Cause my
- Preach crime, your feelings is beamed

581
00:28:21,120 --> 00:28:23,191
And make it and die,
couldn't see with the nakedest eye

582
00:28:24,000 --> 00:28:25,036
Everybody's pride is the same

583
00:28:25,080 --> 00:28:26,116
What difference is mine?

584
00:28:26,120 --> 00:28:28,237
You got a point there, homie, it's true

585
00:28:29,000 --> 00:28:30,150
That nigga's claiming
they the realest be the phoniest dude

586
00:28:30,240 --> 00:28:32,038
That goes for your clique

587
00:28:32,040 --> 00:28:33,110
Pussy niggas holding their dick

588
00:28:33,160 --> 00:28:34,992
Type that'd feed your mom poison

589
00:28:35,040 --> 00:28:36,156
When they knowin' you're sick

590
00:28:36,160 --> 00:28:38,117
It is what it is, man,
It's the life that we chose

591
00:28:38,200 --> 00:28:40,032
Dawg, you caught up in the cycle

592
00:28:40,080 --> 00:28:41,992
Though in spite of the dough
and rightfully so

593
00:28:42,040 --> 00:28:43,156
Shit, you used to be on the block

594
00:28:43,200 --> 00:28:45,032
Before you turned your life around

595
00:28:45,040 --> 00:28:46,076
How many people you shot?

596
00:28:46,120 --> 00:28:47,110
Believe it or not

597
00:28:47,160 --> 00:28:48,992
I still can't sleep in the night

598
00:28:49,040 --> 00:28:50,190
In my dreams, I'm surrounded
by the demons, all right?

599
00:28:50,240 --> 00:28:52,072
And you don't want that, nigga

600
00:28:52,120 --> 00:28:53,236
Trust me when I tell you

601
00:28:54,040 --> 00:28:55,076
Nothing burns like the thought

602
00:28:55,120 --> 00:28:56,156
Of burning in hell, dude

603
00:28:56,160 --> 00:28:58,117
Follow your own heart,
nigga, you know the best

604
00:28:58,160 --> 00:28:59,992
You know the code-
hold your lane

605
00:29:00,040 --> 00:29:01,076
Yeah, but haters still test

606
00:29:01,120 --> 00:29:02,110
They supposed to

607
00:29:02,160 --> 00:29:04,072
See, my nigga,
now you the boss now

608
00:29:04,080 --> 00:29:05,070
You got to pay the cost

609
00:29:05,120 --> 00:29:06,156
When the torch gets tossed down

610
00:29:06,200 --> 00:29:08,192
Yeah, I know, I know,
you reap what you sow

611
00:29:08,240 --> 00:29:11,199
When you're high profile,
you got to keep on the low

612
00:29:11,240 --> 00:29:13,232
I'm trying to drop a jewel on you

613
00:29:13,240 --> 00:29:15,118
No doubt, my nigga, I needed that

614
00:29:15,200 --> 00:29:16,190
Got to warn you

615
00:29:16,240 --> 00:29:17,230
What's up?

616
00:29:37,120 --> 00:29:38,156
Damn, that's fucked up

617
00:29:38,160 --> 00:29:39,196
- They shot my nigga Phya
- Yep

618
00:29:39,240 --> 00:29:41,232
Yo, you need me, dawg, just holler

619
00:29:42,040 --> 00:29:43,190
- I'm a ridah
- I'm good, dawg, Good lookin', my nigga

620
00:29:43,200 --> 00:29:45,078
Most definitely

621
00:29:45,120 --> 00:29:47,999
What I do need is some
heavyweapons for luck

622
00:29:48,040 --> 00:29:49,190
I got this Mac here
straight out of the box

623
00:29:49,240 --> 00:29:52,233
- All right
- Smell it, it ain't never even been shot

624
00:29:53,000 --> 00:29:55,037
Yeah, I'll take two, These shits hot

625
00:29:55,080 --> 00:29:58,039
But I need some bigger shit
that'll clear out the block

626
00:29:58,120 --> 00:30:00,999
Oh, oh, okay, okay,
let me see what I got

627
00:30:01,040 --> 00:30:01,996
Hey, homes

628
00:30:02,040 --> 00:30:03,110
Yo, check it, hand me that box

629
00:30:04,200 --> 00:30:07,159
Wait till you see this shit, all right

630
00:30:07,160 --> 00:30:08,196
My nigga, look, look

631
00:30:08,240 --> 00:30:10,038
This shit right here

632
00:30:10,080 --> 00:30:11,196
This is the cousin of death

633
00:30:11,200 --> 00:30:12,998
And for spots, for a shotgun

634
00:30:13,040 --> 00:30:14,110
I only got four left

635
00:30:14,120 --> 00:30:15,110
This is military issue

636
00:30:15,160 --> 00:30:16,196
- Damn.
- The whole nine rounds

637
00:30:16,240 --> 00:30:18,038
This shit's a beast

638
00:30:18,040 --> 00:30:19,076
That could fucking lay a elephant down

639
00:30:19,160 --> 00:30:20,230
Damn, this shit crazy

640
00:30:20,240 --> 00:30:22,197
You only got four of them?

641
00:30:22,240 --> 00:30:24,232
All right, fuck it, I'll take all of them

642
00:30:25,000 --> 00:30:25,239
What else you got?

643
00:30:26,040 --> 00:30:27,110
You trying to start a war?

644
00:30:27,120 --> 00:30:29,237
No, just givin' niggas
what they askin' for

645
00:30:30,000 --> 00:30:32,037
Well, look, this is a.
assassin rifle with a scope

646
00:30:32,120 --> 00:30:35,113
So you can lay a nigga down
without getting too close

647
00:30:35,120 --> 00:30:36,156
- You hear me?
- That shit is tight

648
00:30:36,200 --> 00:30:38,112
I take three of those, too

649
00:30:38,160 --> 00:30:40,117
But I want to get up close and personal

650
00:30:40,160 --> 00:30:41,150
You know what I'm saying?

651
00:30:41,200 --> 00:30:42,236
Check it, nigga, whatever you need

652
00:30:42,240 --> 00:30:43,196
You know it's all good, nigga

653
00:30:43,240 --> 00:30:45,072
My heat is your heat

654
00:30:45,080 --> 00:30:46,230
My hood is your hood, nigga

655
00:30:47,040 --> 00:30:49,077
Good lookin', my nigga,
you know it's all fam, yo

656
00:30:49,120 --> 00:30:52,113
I'm laying them down
'cause I don't give a damn, yo

657
00:30:52,120 --> 00:30:53,190
Wait till you see this shit, kid

658
00:30:53,240 --> 00:30:55,038
It's a monster M16

659
00:30:55,080 --> 00:30:56,196
With a MO3 grenade launcher

660
00:30:56,240 --> 00:31:00,029
Select fire, semi-matic, or full auto

661
00:31:00,080 --> 00:31:02,117
Hit a nigga with this,
and there ain't no tomorrow

662
00:31:02,120 --> 00:31:04,157
God damn, how many bullets
they hold in them?

663
00:31:04,200 --> 00:31:07,238
Either 30 rounds,
or I got 100 round drum

664
00:31:08,000 --> 00:31:10,117
I'll kill anything within 500 meters

665
00:31:10,160 --> 00:31:11,116
You want to spill blood?

666
00:31:11,160 --> 00:31:13,152
This shit could do it by the liter

667
00:31:13,200 --> 00:31:15,157
- You see this?
- Yeah, that be sick

668
00:31:15,200 --> 00:31:16,998
Yo, I'll take it

669
00:31:17,040 --> 00:31:18,030
You ain't got no more of these shits?

670
00:31:18,080 --> 00:31:19,150
Not here, nigga

671
00:31:19,200 --> 00:31:20,190
You know we got to ship
by the crates

672
00:31:20,240 --> 00:31:22,072
Now let me show you
some more shit

673
00:31:22,120 --> 00:31:24,157
That'll set your ass straight

674
00:31:24,200 --> 00:31:26,078
Now, now, now, this a HK-93

675
00:31:26,120 --> 00:31:28,191
3 calibers like the M16

676
00:31:28,240 --> 00:31:30,152
Reliable, shoots smooth

677
00:31:30,200 --> 00:31:32,078
And it's exceptionally accurate

678
00:31:32,120 --> 00:31:34,191
Say no more, dawg,
You know I got to have that shit

679
00:31:34,200 --> 00:31:36,078
Hey, yo, Stick,
what you know about this?

680
00:31:36,120 --> 00:31:38,157
- What's that?
- This motherfucker come apart

681
00:31:38,200 --> 00:31:39,998
Easy and quick

682
00:31:40,040 --> 00:31:41,110
It's designed to fit in your briefcase

683
00:31:41,120 --> 00:31:42,156
And all that shit

684
00:31:42,200 --> 00:31:44,032
So when you go see
them CEOs, nigga

685
00:31:44,080 --> 00:31:45,150
Take your shit, fuck 'em

686
00:31:45,160 --> 00:31:46,150
That's shit's ill

687
00:31:46,240 --> 00:31:48,118
Take three of those, too

688
00:31:48,120 --> 00:31:50,237
All right, my nigga,
how much I owe you?

689
00:31:51,040 --> 00:31:52,235
This time, nigga,
these ones on the house

690
00:31:52,240 --> 00:31:56,075
Just take these shits
and blow Black in the mouth

691
00:31:56,160 --> 00:31:58,994
Just do that for me,
my nigga, all right?

692
00:31:59,040 --> 00:32:01,032
Take that, you don't owe me shit

693
00:32:26,160 --> 00:32:28,072
All right, settle down, settle down

694
00:32:28,120 --> 00:32:29,156
Listen up, y'all

695
00:32:29,200 --> 00:32:31,192
Captain's on my ass
about this goddamn war

696
00:32:31,240 --> 00:32:33,038
There was a blood bath

697
00:32:33,080 --> 00:32:34,070
And apparently a lot of people got killed

698
00:32:34,080 --> 00:32:35,070
Out in West Hollywood

699
00:32:35,120 --> 00:32:36,156
Somewhere up in the hills

700
00:32:36,200 --> 00:32:39,034
We have Task 4 to get us
insight in the case

701
00:32:39,080 --> 00:32:40,196
So pay attention,
you might learn something

702
00:32:40,200 --> 00:32:42,032
From what they have to say

703
00:32:42,080 --> 00:32:43,036
Our sources tell us what we have

704
00:32:43,080 --> 00:32:44,150
Is two families at war

705
00:32:44,200 --> 00:32:46,999
If I could please direct
your attention to the wall

706
00:32:47,040 --> 00:32:49,032
We been following both
families for quite some time

707
00:32:49,080 --> 00:32:51,151
Even lucky enough to get
intel from the inside

708
00:32:51,200 --> 00:32:54,034
What we have here is a chart
outlining the whole thing

709
00:32:54,080 --> 00:32:56,197
From the bottom to the top
of the food chain

710
00:32:56,240 --> 00:32:57,230
This here is Ike Smith

711
00:32:58,040 --> 00:32:59,076
In the streets they call him Black

712
00:32:59,120 --> 00:33:00,190
There's only one person above him

713
00:33:00,200 --> 00:33:01,190
Oh, yeah? Who's that?

714
00:33:01,200 --> 00:33:02,190
We don't know yet

715
00:33:02,240 --> 00:33:03,196
But it's just a matter of time

716
00:33:03,240 --> 00:33:05,038
We have the pressure on

717
00:33:05,080 --> 00:33:06,150
Somebody out there's
bound to drop a dime

718
00:33:06,200 --> 00:33:07,998
They're involved in everything

719
00:33:08,040 --> 00:33:09,110
From extortion to drug traffic

720
00:33:09,160 --> 00:33:10,150
We know they had a hand

721
00:33:10,200 --> 00:33:12,112
In everything that's been happening

722
00:33:12,120 --> 00:33:14,157
You got proof? Why don't we
just apprehend and convict?

723
00:33:14,200 --> 00:33:16,192
We want to get 'em on murder
so the charges will stick

724
00:33:36,240 --> 00:33:39,074
So who are those guys? And how come
they've all got bald heads?

725
00:33:39,120 --> 00:33:40,110
They're from New York

726
00:33:40,160 --> 00:33:41,150
A few of them did time in the fed

727
00:33:41,200 --> 00:33:43,032
What's their story?

728
00:33:43,080 --> 00:33:44,116
They don't seem to have any leader

729
00:33:44,120 --> 00:33:45,156
But if somebody gives the orders

730
00:33:45,200 --> 00:33:46,998
I would say that he does

731
00:33:47,040 --> 00:33:49,077
Anybody even know
why the war came to pass?

732
00:33:49,120 --> 00:33:51,191
Not sure, we think
a drug deal gone bad

733
00:33:51,200 --> 00:33:52,998
We're gettin' heat from the mayor

734
00:33:53,040 --> 00:33:54,076
To pick up the pace

735
00:33:54,120 --> 00:33:55,110
Sergeant, any idea

736
00:33:55,120 --> 00:33:56,156
Who'd be best for the case?

737
00:33:56,200 --> 00:33:59,079
Yeah, Grant and Lou,
what about you two?

738
00:34:00,120 --> 00:34:02,157
Where in the hell is Grant and Lou?

739
00:34:02,200 --> 00:34:04,032
Sergeant, I don't think
they showed up today.

740
00:34:04,080 --> 00:34:05,070
Well, you find them

741
00:34:05,120 --> 00:34:06,236
and tell them to get
their ass on the case.

742
00:34:44,200 --> 00:34:46,112
Stick got beef,
but the niggas is gone

743
00:34:46,160 --> 00:34:48,117
You see a lot of shit
he picked up from armor?

744
00:34:48,160 --> 00:34:50,038
Yeah, nigga got max
with wipes and Ilamas

745
00:34:50,080 --> 00:34:51,150
You niggas out here
talkin' about my drama?

746
00:34:51,160 --> 00:34:52,230
Shit, motherfucker,
you got enough guns

747
00:34:53,000 --> 00:34:54,070
Whoever you going to kill
you can only kill once

748
00:34:54,160 --> 00:34:56,072
Why are you gonna waste
all them shells on them chumps?

749
00:34:56,080 --> 00:34:57,150
Shit, you can't lead by a uncle's nuts

750
00:34:57,200 --> 00:34:59,112
All right, nigga, just
keep your hands clean

751
00:34:59,160 --> 00:35:00,992
Before your Allah, just keep the scene

752
00:35:01,040 --> 00:35:02,235
You know, if you need help,
I can get the team

753
00:35:02,240 --> 00:35:04,072
Nothin' to make
a phone call to Q!ueens

754
00:35:04,120 --> 00:35:05,236
Good lookin', my nigga,
appreciate the help

755
00:35:05,240 --> 00:35:07,118
But this is personal,
I want to do it myself

756
00:35:07,160 --> 00:35:09,072
Before I make
these niggas feel what I felt

757
00:35:09,080 --> 00:35:10,116
They're pushing everywhere,
but I'm gon' take them down

758
00:35:10,200 --> 00:35:12,157
Yeah, no doubt, do your thing

759
00:35:12,160 --> 00:35:14,038
Problems, give us a ring

760
00:35:14,120 --> 00:35:16,032
What you ain't got, we'll bring

761
00:35:16,040 --> 00:35:17,076
Also pull some strings

762
00:35:17,120 --> 00:35:19,032
I got that M16

763
00:35:19,080 --> 00:35:20,230
With that infra beam

764
00:35:21,000 --> 00:35:22,036
So either I'm gonna way

765
00:35:22,080 --> 00:35:24,037
End up dead or in the bing

766
00:35:40,240 --> 00:35:42,072
This better be the right house

767
00:35:42,120 --> 00:35:43,236
Or your ass is dead, you feel me?

768
00:35:44,040 --> 00:35:45,190
Empty this whole clip in your head

769
00:35:45,240 --> 00:35:47,232
Yeah, do it. Matter of fact,
let me pop this punk.

770
00:35:48,000 --> 00:35:48,239
- No, not yet
- Why?

771
00:35:49,000 --> 00:35:50,070
We might need him.
Lock the trunk

772
00:35:50,120 --> 00:35:51,156
All right

773
00:35:53,200 --> 00:35:55,112
All right, so what's the plan of attack?

774
00:35:55,160 --> 00:35:56,230
We kill the head, the body falls

775
00:35:57,000 --> 00:35:57,194
So we're after Black

776
00:35:57,280 --> 00:35:59,033
Y'all, go in the front

777
00:35:59,080 --> 00:36:00,070
And I'll come in through the back

778
00:36:00,120 --> 00:36:01,156
All right, but be careful, nigga

779
00:36:01,200 --> 00:36:02,236
'Cause it might be a trap

780
00:36:03,040 --> 00:36:03,996
All right.

781
00:36:19,160 --> 00:36:21,152
This is too easy, man,
sure we in the right crib?

782
00:36:21,200 --> 00:36:24,159
Would have thought they had
more security than this

783
00:36:24,160 --> 00:36:25,196
Yo, Kye

784
00:36:25,280 --> 00:36:27,112
Kye, watch your back

785
00:36:27,120 --> 00:36:28,236
Oh, shit, I didn't even see that cat

786
00:36:29,000 --> 00:36:30,116
That's 'cause you're falling off, nigga

787
00:36:30,160 --> 00:36:31,150
I told you you was slipping

788
00:36:31,200 --> 00:36:32,236
You heard that?

789
00:36:33,000 --> 00:36:34,036
Hold up. Let me listen, nigga

790
00:36:34,080 --> 00:36:36,197
Sound like it's coming from the kitchen

791
00:36:36,240 --> 00:36:39,153
Let's go check it out
because my fingers is itchin'

792
00:36:44,200 --> 00:36:46,157
Shut the fuck up, bitch.

793
00:36:55,240 --> 00:36:58,074
Oh, Black, come out, you fat fuck

794
00:36:58,120 --> 00:37:00,191

00:37:00,200 --> 00:37:01,190

00:37:01,240 --> 00:37:04,039

00:37:21,040 --> 00:37:24,033
I ain't scared
of you clown motherfuckers

804
00:37:24,080 --> 00:37:25,196
Hold up, hold up, son

805
00:37:25,240 --> 00:37:26,230
Before you air him out

806
00:37:26,240 --> 00:37:29,039
Let me find if he know
Black whereabouts

807
00:37:29,040 --> 00:37:31,157
I done tried that shit,
nigga acting like a bitch

808
00:37:31,200 --> 00:37:34,034
Kye beat the shit out of him,

809
00:37:34,080 --> 00:37:36,117
Listen, you better tell me
where that fat bastard is

810
00:37:36,160 --> 00:37:38,117
Fuck y'all niggas,
I ain't telling you shit

811
00:37:38,160 --> 00:37:39,116
See what I mean?

812
00:37:39,160 --> 00:37:41,072
You want to die slow,
or you want to die quick?

813
00:37:41,080 --> 00:37:43,151
I don't give a fuck, nigga, kill me,
you can suck my dick

814
00:37:43,240 --> 00:37:46,039
Young niggas, no respect and shit

815
00:37:46,040 --> 00:37:48,111
Go ahead, nigga, pop his wig

816
00:37:48,160 --> 00:37:50,038
Fuck-

817
00:37:50,040 --> 00:37:51,030
Lights out

818
00:37:51,080 --> 00:37:52,116
Let's get the fuck out of here

819
00:37:52,160 --> 00:37:53,150
Nice house

820
00:38:13,200 --> 00:38:14,236
So what it looking like here

821
00:38:14,280 --> 00:38:16,078
Looks like the perps
made an entrance

822
00:38:16,120 --> 00:38:17,110
Through the front and the side

823
00:38:17,120 --> 00:38:18,156
They scrubbed the house clean

824
00:38:18,200 --> 00:38:19,156
Killed everybody in sight

825
00:38:19,200 --> 00:38:21,032
We got a guy taped up

826
00:38:21,040 --> 00:38:22,076
- With a hole in his brain
- Damn.

827
00:38:22,120 --> 00:38:23,156
It was fuckin' brutal

828
00:38:23,200 --> 00:38:24,236
They even killed the maid

829
00:38:25,000 --> 00:38:26,036
Damn, they meant business, huh?

830
00:38:26,080 --> 00:38:27,116
Well, they left over 00 shell cases

831
00:38:27,160 --> 00:38:28,150
Will we at least find out

832
00:38:28,160 --> 00:38:29,150
Where the owner of the place is?

833
00:38:29,240 --> 00:38:30,196
No, but his worker's right there

834
00:38:30,240 --> 00:38:31,230
With the cigar in his mouth

835
00:38:32,040 --> 00:38:33,030
Excuse me, sir

836
00:38:33,040 --> 00:38:34,110
Do you work for
the owner of the house?

837
00:38:34,160 --> 00:38:35,150
Yeah, he's on the phone

838
00:38:35,240 --> 00:38:37,072
Visiting family in the hospital

839
00:38:37,080 --> 00:38:38,070
He asks who are you

840
00:38:38,120 --> 00:38:39,110
And did you find
the man responsible

841
00:38:39,160 --> 00:38:40,150
He Detective Grant

842
00:38:40,160 --> 00:38:42,038
And I'm Detective Lou

843
00:38:42,120 --> 00:38:43,110
We ain't made any arrests

844
00:38:43,120 --> 00:38:44,076
We're doing the best that we can do

845
00:38:44,120 --> 00:38:45,110
But if you have a clue

846
00:38:45,160 --> 00:38:46,992
That could be essential to the case

847
00:38:47,040 --> 00:38:48,190
Please speak, help us lock
these animals in a cage

848
00:38:49,000 --> 00:38:50,992
Man, put me on speaker,
let 'em talk to me

849
00:38:51,040 --> 00:38:52,030
- Okay
- Made any new friends?

850
00:38:52,080 --> 00:38:53,116
- No
- Or new enemies?

851
00:38:53,160 --> 00:38:55,038
- Hell, no
- Come on, nigga, give me something

852
00:38:55,080 --> 00:38:56,196
- I can't think of none at all
- He got my card

853
00:38:56,240 --> 00:38:58,118
If you think of something,
give me a call

854
00:38:58,160 --> 00:38:59,150
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah

855
00:38:59,200 --> 00:39:00,998
All right. I be in touch

856
00:39:01,040 --> 00:39:02,076
You got somewhere
that you can stay

857
00:39:02,080 --> 00:39:03,070
While they clean this place up?

858
00:39:03,120 --> 00:39:04,110
What?

859
00:39:04,160 --> 00:39:05,230
Yeah, in Honolulu
I got some real estate

860
00:39:05,280 --> 00:39:07,033
nigga, till this investigation ends

861
00:39:07,040 --> 00:39:08,030
You can't leave the state

862
00:39:08,080 --> 00:39:10,151
What? Fuck that scene,
now I'm upset

863
00:39:10,160 --> 00:39:12,197
Don't hassle me to tell me
I'm the suspect

864
00:39:12,240 --> 00:39:14,038
- That's what it look like
- Bullshit

865
00:39:14,080 --> 00:39:15,116
Pull up the car right now

866
00:39:15,160 --> 00:39:18,073
And, Afteeka, meet me
at the cigar lounge

867
00:39:21,120 --> 00:39:22,998
I'm gonna have to kill 'em now!

868
00:39:32,120 --> 00:39:33,156
Yo, Stick getting really near

869
00:39:33,200 --> 00:39:34,236
Word to mother

870
00:39:34,240 --> 00:39:37,074
Yo, boss, think we should
call your brother?

871
00:39:37,120 --> 00:39:38,190
Listen to me, nigga

872
00:39:38,200 --> 00:39:40,078
Word get out about this shit

873
00:39:40,120 --> 00:39:41,190
You might as well
just slit your wrists

874
00:39:41,240 --> 00:39:43,072
All right, all right, all right, man

875
00:39:43,120 --> 00:39:44,156
God damn it, I don't believe this shit

876
00:39:44,240 --> 00:39:45,196
They killed my girl

877
00:39:45,240 --> 00:39:47,072
Got to light that bunch

878
00:39:47,120 --> 00:39:50,113
Them niggas got to die for that shit

879
00:39:50,120 --> 00:39:52,077
It's war, that's it

880
00:39:53,120 --> 00:39:54,998
Now get the fuck up!

881
00:39:55,040 --> 00:39:56,997
Let's go!

882
00:39:57,280 --> 00:39:59,112
Move, bitch!

883
00:40:20,040 --> 00:40:21,156
The hit man you called is here.

884
00:40:21,160 --> 00:40:22,196
All right, show him in.

885
00:40:22,240 --> 00:40:24,118
- And I'll be downstairs.
- All right.

886
00:40:28,280 --> 00:40:30,033
Hello, Mr. Black

887
00:40:30,040 --> 00:40:31,997
I'm King Khi, pleased to meet you

888
00:40:32,040 --> 00:40:34,111
What I understand, you having
complications with some people

889
00:40:34,120 --> 00:40:36,191
Yeah, that's right, I want those fuckers
shot in the brains

890
00:40:36,240 --> 00:40:37,196
I don't care what it cost

891
00:40:37,240 --> 00:40:39,072
See, money ain't a thing

892
00:40:39,120 --> 00:40:42,033
- Hey, Kim, what's on the menu today?
- Chicken

893
00:40:42,040 --> 00:40:43,190
You hungry? You want this bitch
to fix you a plate?

894
00:40:43,280 --> 00:40:46,114
I'd like to conclude
our business, if that's okay

895
00:40:46,120 --> 00:40:47,998
Oh, you get right down to it, huh?

896
00:40:48,040 --> 00:40:49,076
You don't play

897
00:40:49,120 --> 00:40:51,157
What happens if you fail,
or if you miss a target?

898
00:40:51,200 --> 00:40:52,236
No, I always get my man

899
00:40:53,000 --> 00:40:54,116
I'm afraid failure's not an option

900
00:40:54,160 --> 00:40:56,152
I would think my referrals would
speak for themselves

901
00:40:56,200 --> 00:40:58,999
I never missed a mark
in the ten years I worked in this field

902
00:40:59,040 --> 00:41:00,156
If it's human, can bleed and die

903
00:41:00,240 --> 00:41:01,151
And givin' you problems,
I could solve 'em

904
00:41:01,160 --> 00:41:02,196
I'll need half now

905
00:41:03,000 --> 00:41:04,150
The other half when the job's done

906
00:41:04,240 --> 00:41:06,118
Send 'em back, you'll get the rest

907
00:41:06,120 --> 00:41:08,032
When you kill these motherfuckers

908
00:41:08,080 --> 00:41:09,116
And show me proof of death

909
00:41:09,160 --> 00:41:11,994
As soon as it's done,
I want you to call here

910
00:41:12,040 --> 00:41:14,077
You wanna count it, nigga,
make sure it's all there?

911
00:41:14,080 --> 00:41:15,196
No, that won't be necessary

912
00:41:15,240 --> 00:41:16,230
Killing game is legendary

913
00:41:17,040 --> 00:41:18,030
This time tomorrow, yo

914
00:41:18,080 --> 00:41:19,150
You'll find him in the mortuary

915
00:41:19,200 --> 00:41:20,190
Two days later, dawg

916
00:41:20,280 --> 00:41:22,158
You'll find him in the cemetery

917
00:41:22,160 --> 00:41:24,197
Mom's cryin' sins buried, Pa,
no need to worry

918
00:41:24,240 --> 00:41:26,118
Here go his files,
with all his specifics

919
00:41:26,160 --> 00:41:27,992
I don't see why you need it

920
00:41:28,040 --> 00:41:29,030
Just hit him with the business

921
00:41:29,080 --> 00:41:30,150
To be optimum effective

922
00:41:30,200 --> 00:41:32,032
I need the logistics

923
00:41:32,080 --> 00:41:34,151
No fingerprint shit,
no clues for forensics

924
00:41:34,160 --> 00:41:37,039
No evidence and no breathing witness

925
00:41:37,040 --> 00:41:40,078
It's what I do, bro, business is business

926
00:41:41,120 --> 00:41:42,190
Hey, you want Kim to walk you out?

927
00:41:42,200 --> 00:41:43,190
No, man. I found myway in.

928
00:41:43,240 --> 00:41:45,038
I can find myway out.

929
00:42:41,120 --> 00:42:43,157
That's an awful nice watch,
it must cost a pretty penny

930
00:42:43,160 --> 00:42:44,150
Can I get you somethin'?

931
00:42:44,200 --> 00:42:46,192
Yeah, let me get a double shot of Henny

932
00:42:46,240 --> 00:42:48,118
Looks like somebody's
having a hell of a day

933
00:42:48,160 --> 00:42:51,073
But I'm telling you,
you can't drink them demons away

934
00:42:51,120 --> 00:42:53,237
If experience is the best teacher,
then listen here

935
00:42:54,000 --> 00:42:56,037
I know, I've been
trying it for 15 years

936
00:42:56,120 --> 00:42:58,157
- What's your name?
- They call me Sticky, and you?

937
00:42:58,160 --> 00:42:59,150
I'm Sam, have a seat

938
00:42:59,200 --> 00:43:01,112
Get some free advice
from an old man

939
00:43:01,120 --> 00:43:04,033
- So what's up?
- Nothing, my life's a mess

940
00:43:04,080 --> 00:43:06,197
Life or death, I'm drownin',
tryin' to fight for breath

941
00:43:06,240 --> 00:43:09,199
Wanna get out, but end up back
right in the mess

942
00:43:09,240 --> 00:43:11,277
Just confused,
don't know my right from left

943
00:43:12,040 --> 00:43:14,191
Well, here's my advice,
I say fuck the world

944
00:43:14,200 --> 00:43:17,113
What's her name?
If there's trouble, it's gotta be a girl

945
00:43:17,160 --> 00:43:19,197
Well, she ain't involved,
but her name is Heaven

946
00:43:19,240 --> 00:43:21,072
Tryin' to get her out this hell hole

947
00:43:21,120 --> 00:43:22,110
Just found out she's pregnant

948
00:43:22,160 --> 00:43:24,038
You caught up in that love shit

949
00:43:24,040 --> 00:43:25,156
No wonder you're trippin'

950
00:43:25,200 --> 00:43:27,157
Don't you know
everybody in love got conditions?

951
00:43:27,200 --> 00:43:30,034
They only love you
if you do this, you do that

952
00:43:30,040 --> 00:43:32,077
Only love you if you're
like this or like that

953
00:43:32,160 --> 00:43:34,072
- Right.
- Never trust friends

954
00:43:34,080 --> 00:43:35,150
Learn to use your other sense

955
00:43:35,240 --> 00:43:38,039
And seal the intentions
and say less then necessary

956
00:43:38,040 --> 00:43:39,030
Every living creature's

957
00:43:39,120 --> 00:43:40,236
First law of life is survival

958
00:43:40,240 --> 00:43:42,038
A man might kill a few

959
00:43:42,080 --> 00:43:43,150
But he won't die for you

960
00:43:43,200 --> 00:43:45,032
The only one that ever did that

961
00:43:45,040 --> 00:43:46,110
Name's in the Bible

962
00:43:46,160 --> 00:43:48,152
And they even usin'
your religion to divide you

963
00:43:48,160 --> 00:43:50,117
Listen, this whole country's a prison

964
00:43:50,160 --> 00:43:52,197
But it's so damn big,
you don't know you're in it

965
00:43:52,240 --> 00:43:54,152
- Damn.
- They got apartments and cars

966
00:43:54,200 --> 00:43:55,236
And planes and supermarkets

967
00:43:56,040 --> 00:43:57,997
Jobs, businesses makin' big profits

968
00:43:58,040 --> 00:43:59,997
But try to leave without a passport

969
00:44:00,040 --> 00:44:03,078
And you'll see,
just how much in jail you are

970
00:44:03,080 --> 00:44:04,150
Don't playwith your life

971
00:44:04,200 --> 00:44:06,112
You might not get another one

972
00:44:06,160 --> 00:44:08,152
The hell with everybody,
look out for number 1

973
00:44:08,200 --> 00:44:11,159
I hear you, brother,
but livin' like that just seem wrong

974
00:44:11,200 --> 00:44:13,032
When you're dead
and you're gone, son

975
00:44:13,040 --> 00:44:14,110
The world still go on

976
00:45:19,240 --> 00:45:21,232
Hey, yo. Come here.

977
00:45:21,240 --> 00:45:23,197
- Yo, let us talk to you for a second.
- Come here, nigga.

978
00:45:23,240 --> 00:45:25,118
I didn't know it was illegal

979
00:45:25,160 --> 00:45:27,038
- To cross the intersection
- Nah, it's not

980
00:45:27,080 --> 00:45:28,230
Just wanna ask you some questions

981
00:45:29,000 --> 00:45:30,036
Mind if we search you, nigga?

982
00:45:30,080 --> 00:45:31,070
You got anyweapons?

983
00:45:31,120 --> 00:45:32,110
Wait, wait, hold up, man

984
00:45:32,160 --> 00:45:34,072
I ain't breakin' no laws

985
00:45:34,120 --> 00:45:36,077
- What's the problem?
- Don't you need probable cause?

986
00:45:36,120 --> 00:45:37,156
Fuck that, I know my rights

987
00:45:37,160 --> 00:45:38,992
Hell no, you can't search me

988
00:45:39,040 --> 00:45:40,030
What's up with your partner?

989
00:45:40,080 --> 00:45:41,150
What's wrong, you wanna hurt me?

990
00:45:41,200 --> 00:45:43,237
If we wasn't in public,
I'd make you beg for mercy

991
00:45:44,040 --> 00:45:46,111
Crooked-ass cops,
man, all ya niggas dirty

992
00:45:46,160 --> 00:45:47,150
No, you listen to me, punk

993
00:45:47,200 --> 00:45:48,998
Don't you ever disrespect me

994
00:45:49,040 --> 00:45:50,076
No, you ain't that big, homie

995
00:45:50,120 --> 00:45:51,110
Trust me, you ain't ready

996
00:45:51,160 --> 00:45:52,196
I'll kill you, motherfucker

997
00:45:52,240 --> 00:45:54,232
You think you tough, huh?
Huh, motherfucker?

998
00:45:54,240 --> 00:45:56,118
All right, all right, that's enough

999
00:45:56,160 --> 00:45:58,994
We got word you got
a war goin' on with Black Mike

1000
00:45:59,040 --> 00:46:00,076
Well whoever's your informant

1001
00:46:00,120 --> 00:46:01,190
They hitting the crack pipe

1002
00:46:01,240 --> 00:46:03,994
If I'm under arrest,
then put the cuffs on me

1003
00:46:04,040 --> 00:46:06,111
I'm legitimate,
I own a record company

1004
00:46:06,160 --> 00:46:08,038
The record company you own

1005
00:46:08,080 --> 00:46:09,196
Is how you're cleaning the dough

1006
00:46:09,240 --> 00:46:11,152
And the money came from selling
Ecstasy and the blow

1007
00:46:11,200 --> 00:46:12,236
Well, if you need a fix

1008
00:46:13,000 --> 00:46:14,070
Then come see me, then

1009
00:46:14,120 --> 00:46:16,157
Oh, shit, you's a comedian

1010
00:46:16,160 --> 00:46:17,196
Yeah.

1011
00:46:17,240 --> 00:46:19,072
Except I'm not that funny

1012
00:46:19,120 --> 00:46:21,112
I ain't jokin, I got Johnnie Cochran money

1013
00:46:21,160 --> 00:46:22,196
Oh, so you's a rich nigga

1014
00:46:22,240 --> 00:46:24,038
Me, homeboy, knock ya bloody

1015
00:46:24,080 --> 00:46:25,116
Don't think 'cause you a cop

1016
00:46:25,160 --> 00:46:26,196
It might not get ugly

1017
00:46:26,240 --> 00:46:28,072
Don't think 'cause I'm a cop

1018
00:46:28,080 --> 00:46:30,072
And you got some money,
I won't take

1019
00:46:30,120 --> 00:46:31,236
This badge off now,
and beat you bloody

1020
00:46:31,240 --> 00:46:33,118
So what's up, nigga?
Let's do this.

1021
00:46:33,160 --> 00:46:35,117
- I'll call your bluff.
- Lieutenant.

1022
00:46:35,120 --> 00:46:36,998
Come on, Lieutenant.
That's enough.

1023
00:46:37,040 --> 00:46:38,190
- You lucky, motherfucker.
- You lucky.

1024
00:46:38,240 --> 00:46:40,038
I'm gonna see you next time.

1025
00:46:40,080 --> 00:46:42,037
- Yo, let's just get in the ride.
- Shut the fuck up, nigga.

1026
00:47:07,240 --> 00:47:10,119
Look at this fuckin'
nigga right here.

1027
00:47:10,120 --> 00:47:11,156
What up, nigga, man?

1028
00:47:11,200 --> 00:47:12,236
Yo, what up Stick.
What's poppin', my nigga?

1029
00:47:12,240 --> 00:47:15,153
You a wild boy, son.
You really popped two cops?

1030
00:47:15,200 --> 00:47:18,079
Yeah, fuck them pigs,
they deserve what they got

1031
00:47:18,080 --> 00:47:20,037
But how Phya holdin' up
in the hospital?

1032
00:47:20,080 --> 00:47:21,150
- Man, he be all right
- Yeah?

1033
00:47:21,200 --> 00:47:23,112
- You know that nigga's strong as a bull
- Right.

1034
00:47:23,160 --> 00:47:25,117
But look, dawg, right now,
you need to chill

1035
00:47:25,160 --> 00:47:26,196
- What?
- Too much heat on you

1036
00:47:26,240 --> 00:47:28,152
We just put up a million for bail

1037
00:47:28,160 --> 00:47:29,150
I want that nigga Black dead

1038
00:47:29,160 --> 00:47:31,038
Just as bad as you

1039
00:47:31,120 --> 00:47:33,077
- We raided his house, nigga
- But what did that do?

1040
00:47:33,120 --> 00:47:35,077
He's still alive, still breathing

1041
00:47:35,120 --> 00:47:36,190
Still walking, still talking

1042
00:47:36,200 --> 00:47:38,112
I won't be satisfied until he's still

1043
00:47:38,160 --> 00:47:40,231
- In a coffin, dawg
- I can't talk to this nigga, man

1044
00:47:41,000 --> 00:47:42,116
You wanna be a hot head, you see?

1045
00:47:42,160 --> 00:47:44,117
niggas never learn
'til they get shot dead

1046
00:47:44,160 --> 00:47:46,197
But Stick, they killed
our niggas and took our cake

1047
00:47:46,200 --> 00:47:49,159
They had it in for us soon as we
stepped foot in this state, man

1048
00:47:49,240 --> 00:47:51,232
But goin' to war
with Black will be a big mistake

1049
00:47:51,240 --> 00:47:53,072
That nigga gotta die

1050
00:47:53,120 --> 00:47:54,156
And I don't care what you say

1051
00:48:15,240 --> 00:48:18,039
Yo, why you actin'
like you scared and shit?

1052
00:48:18,120 --> 00:48:19,156
Yo, look, nigga, don't come at me

1053
00:48:19,200 --> 00:48:20,998
With no scared business, okay?

1054
00:48:21,040 --> 00:48:22,235
I'll put a hole in the nigga
quicker than you

1055
00:48:23,040 --> 00:48:24,190
No argument there, with guns

1056
00:48:24,200 --> 00:48:26,032
Nobody's sicker than you

1057
00:48:26,080 --> 00:48:28,072
That's right, nigga,
don't you ever forget that fact

1058
00:48:28,120 --> 00:48:29,190
- So then what's up, dawg?
- What's up?

1059
00:48:29,240 --> 00:48:31,072
Whywe can't get at Black?

1060
00:48:31,120 --> 00:48:32,110
We done bothered his house

1061
00:48:32,160 --> 00:48:33,196
They be waitin' for the attack

1062
00:48:33,240 --> 00:48:35,038
And walkin' right into a trap?

1063
00:48:35,080 --> 00:48:36,116
Gotta be smarter than that

1064
00:48:36,160 --> 00:48:38,038
It's his town, his advantage

1065
00:48:38,040 --> 00:48:40,157
He holdin' the weight,
even police workin' for him

1066
00:48:40,200 --> 00:48:41,236
They rolled on me today

1067
00:48:41,240 --> 00:48:42,993
See, he a dumb nigga

1068
00:48:43,040 --> 00:48:44,190
He don't hear nothing I say

1069
00:48:44,240 --> 00:48:47,039
nigga won't be satisfied
until he's slumped in the grave

1070
00:48:47,080 --> 00:48:48,116
You ain't learn from the club

1071
00:48:48,160 --> 00:48:50,117
And the police shit? Who this?

1072
00:48:50,160 --> 00:48:52,117
Your brother flossing in his new whip

1073
00:48:52,120 --> 00:48:54,157
nigga, when you get back in town?

1074
00:48:54,160 --> 00:48:57,119
Just now, heard about
the bullshit that went down

1075
00:48:57,160 --> 00:48:59,231
What's up, nigga?
Come here, gimme a pound

1076
00:49:00,000 --> 00:49:01,070
- You all right?
- Yeah, man

1077
00:49:01,160 --> 00:49:03,197
- Just sick of these clowns
- Come on, relax, man

1078
00:49:03,200 --> 00:49:05,112
I'm here, let's have some fun

1079
00:49:05,160 --> 00:49:07,197
Jump in the whip,
come with me to make this run

1080
00:49:47,120 --> 00:49:49,077
- Man.
- What's up?

1081
00:49:49,120 --> 00:49:50,156
They some dumb ass niggas, yo

1082
00:49:50,160 --> 00:49:51,992
They don't fuckin' listen, bro

1083
00:49:52,040 --> 00:49:53,076
I'm tellin' you, they gon' fuck around

1084
00:49:53,120 --> 00:49:54,190
And get us all caught up

1085
00:49:55,000 --> 00:49:56,150
But niggas did come at us first

1086
00:49:56,200 --> 00:49:58,078
And? A tooth for some teeth

1087
00:49:58,080 --> 00:49:59,992
We can't let it worse, man

1088
00:50:00,040 --> 00:50:02,032
I hear you, I ain't tryin'
to fight with you

1089
00:50:02,040 --> 00:50:03,997
But, brother, I know
when somethin' ain't right

1090
00:50:04,040 --> 00:50:05,110
Who'd you talk to?
What's wrong?

1091
00:50:05,160 --> 00:50:07,038
You ain't yourself, the Stick I know

1092
00:50:07,080 --> 00:50:09,072
Woulda been ready
to give these other niggas hell

1093
00:50:09,120 --> 00:50:10,156
And he wouldn't of stopped

1094
00:50:10,160 --> 00:50:12,072
'Til them niggas
was dead, what's up

1095
00:50:12,120 --> 00:50:14,032
Lil' bro, what's
going on in your head?

1096
00:50:14,080 --> 00:50:15,992
Papered up,
thinking about changing it up

1097
00:50:16,040 --> 00:50:19,033
Mywhole lifestyle,
thinkin' about hanging it up

1098
00:50:19,080 --> 00:50:20,116
Had a lot on my mind

1099
00:50:20,160 --> 00:50:21,230
That's why I never said shit

1100
00:50:21,240 --> 00:50:24,153
- And I just found out my girl pregnant
- Damn.

1101
00:50:24,200 --> 00:50:26,112
I want out, son, I got enough green

1102
00:50:26,120 --> 00:50:29,079
As a man, gotta put
my seed before my team

1103
00:50:29,120 --> 00:50:31,237
I just think that a nigga gettin' older

1104
00:50:31,240 --> 00:50:34,074
And gettin' sick
of lookin' over my shoulder

1105
00:50:34,120 --> 00:50:36,191
My heart just get
colder and colder

1106
00:50:36,240 --> 00:50:39,039
Till it's over, I live like a soldier

1107
00:50:39,040 --> 00:50:41,111
When we was comin' up,
'member what I told ya?

1108
00:50:41,160 --> 00:50:43,994
You gon' always have to
look over your shoulder

1109
00:50:44,040 --> 00:50:46,157
The game make your heart
colder and colder

1110
00:50:46,200 --> 00:50:48,999
Till it's over, live like a soldier

1111
00:50:49,040 --> 00:50:51,077
I mean, damn, what can I say?

1112
00:50:51,080 --> 00:50:53,231
You made up your mind,
look like the decision is made

1113
00:50:54,040 --> 00:50:56,077
Yeah, I'm gonna do it,
I'm leaving today

1114
00:50:56,120 --> 00:50:57,156
Just gotta pick up my girl

1115
00:50:57,160 --> 00:50:58,196
Then I'm out on a plane, but

1116
00:50:58,240 --> 00:51:01,119
Brother to brother,
gotta ask you a question

1117
00:51:01,120 --> 00:51:03,112
When I go, do I at least
have your blessings?

1118
00:51:03,200 --> 00:51:05,032
Man, what you talking about?

1119
00:51:05,080 --> 00:51:07,037
- What kinda question is that?
- Just sayin', man.

1120
00:51:07,080 --> 00:51:08,150
Oh, shit, You got your strap?

1121
00:51:09,200 --> 00:51:10,190
Get down!

1122
00:51:13,040 --> 00:51:14,190
Shit, nigga I told you you missed

1123
00:51:14,240 --> 00:51:16,152
The motherfuckers ain't dead

1124
00:51:16,200 --> 00:51:18,157
- Should we bounce?
- Hell no, Black will have our heads

1125
00:51:18,200 --> 00:51:20,032
- Yo, you hit?
- No, I'm good, son

1126
00:51:20,080 --> 00:51:21,196
- What about you?
- No, I'm good

1127
00:51:21,240 --> 00:51:23,197
Here, take this, on the count of two

1128
00:51:23,240 --> 00:51:25,152
Yo, fuck that, I need this reward,
let's get this bread

1129
00:51:25,200 --> 00:51:28,113
I got enough lead to tear both them
niggas to shreds

1130
00:51:28,160 --> 00:51:30,038
Yeah, yeah, you right, on the wall

1131
00:51:30,040 --> 00:51:31,190
Let's get this dough

1132
00:51:31,240 --> 00:51:33,118
Oh, shit, where the fuck did they go?

1133
00:51:33,160 --> 00:51:35,117
- Right here, motherfucker.
- Oh, shit.

1134
00:51:40,120 --> 00:51:42,157
What's up now, motherfucker?

1135
00:52:23,000 --> 00:52:26,072
Dear God, my nigga,
you gotta help me

1136
00:52:26,120 --> 00:52:28,157
I know I said I quit the game
when I was wealthy

1137
00:52:28,200 --> 00:52:31,079
The times was hard,
the moneywas easy

1138
00:52:31,080 --> 00:52:33,117
I meant no harm,
you gotta believe me

1139
00:52:33,160 --> 00:52:35,994
Fuck I do now? No turnin' back

1140
00:52:36,040 --> 00:52:36,996
Too much money at stake

1141
00:52:37,040 --> 00:52:38,110
Too many niggas got clapped

1142
00:52:38,160 --> 00:52:40,994
I'm goin' to hell with
the rest of the planet

1143
00:52:41,040 --> 00:52:43,111
I know it, I broke
all your Commandments

1144
00:52:43,160 --> 00:52:45,994
You don't know what
this world do to you

1145
00:52:46,040 --> 00:52:48,111
The last time I been
to church was a funeral

1146
00:52:48,160 --> 00:52:50,197
You can't hear me, why fool myself?

1147
00:52:50,240 --> 00:52:53,119
I'm alone in this world
talkin' to myself

1148
00:52:53,160 --> 00:52:54,116
Believe me, my brotha

1149
00:52:54,160 --> 00:52:55,992
He hears every syllable

1150
00:52:56,040 --> 00:52:58,111
You look troubled,
like there's something killing you

1151
00:52:58,160 --> 00:52:59,230
I'm knowing your pain

1152
00:53:00,000 --> 00:53:01,116
- Without even knowing you
- How you know my pain?

1153
00:53:01,160 --> 00:53:03,152
I been there, I know exactly
what you're going through

1154
00:53:03,200 --> 00:53:05,999
These streets, they can eat you alive

1155
00:53:06,040 --> 00:53:07,235
It's a shame what you gotta do
just to survive

1156
00:53:08,000 --> 00:53:09,150
First you gotta
know about the hood

1157
00:53:09,200 --> 00:53:11,078
To be my teacher

1158
00:53:11,120 --> 00:53:13,112
- Well, son, I wasn't always a preacher
- Yeah?

1159
00:53:13,160 --> 00:53:16,039
- I been in the game, I been in the prisons
- Word?

1160
00:53:16,080 --> 00:53:18,151
- I was living in pain with an addiction
- Damn.

1161
00:53:18,200 --> 00:53:21,034
- I did a few things when people was missing
- Word?

1162
00:53:21,080 --> 00:53:23,151
It's never in vain,
just talk and he'll listen

1163
00:53:43,000 --> 00:53:44,150
Just tryin' to live my life better

1164
00:53:44,200 --> 00:53:46,032
Man, with God as mywitness

1165
00:53:46,080 --> 00:53:48,151
Then drop to your knees,
ask for forgiveness

1166
00:53:48,160 --> 00:53:50,197
Get outta the dark,
come be in the light

1167
00:53:50,240 --> 00:53:53,039
It's not that easy,
I done did some things in my life

1168
00:53:53,080 --> 00:53:54,196
Until you make peace with the Lord

1169
00:53:54,240 --> 00:53:56,232
Nothing go right,
you must walk by faith-

1170
00:53:57,040 --> 00:53:58,076
I know, and not by sight

1171
00:53:58,080 --> 00:53:59,116
But a nigga just ain't gonna catch

1172
00:53:59,160 --> 00:54:00,196
The Holy Ghost overnight

1173
00:54:00,240 --> 00:54:03,119
With temptation,
it's always a constant fight

1174
00:54:03,160 --> 00:54:05,994
I feel you, but cats
out here ruthless

1175
00:54:06,040 --> 00:54:07,076
Pop you, throw you in the trunk

1176
00:54:07,120 --> 00:54:08,156
Couldn't give two shits

1177
00:54:08,200 --> 00:54:09,156
I'll be lucky to live

1178
00:54:09,200 --> 00:54:10,236
Through the end of the night

1179
00:54:10,240 --> 00:54:12,118
See, that right there
should tell you something

1180
00:54:12,160 --> 00:54:13,992
You probably not living right

1181
00:54:14,040 --> 00:54:15,997
You need to surround
yourself with love

1182
00:54:16,040 --> 00:54:18,077
I'm just a pastor, only God can judge

1183
00:54:18,120 --> 00:54:19,110
But you right, though

1184
00:54:19,160 --> 00:54:20,230
I know enough is enough

1185
00:54:21,000 --> 00:54:21,990
I guess I'm looking
for a blessing

1186
00:54:22,080 --> 00:54:23,116
From the man up above

1187
00:54:48,040 --> 00:54:49,235
Yo, niggas is trying to kill you

1188
00:54:50,000 --> 00:54:50,990
Cops is, too, you fronting

1189
00:54:51,040 --> 00:54:52,076
I'm good, just go the hospital

1190
00:54:52,120 --> 00:54:53,190
- And visit your cousin
- All right.

1191
00:54:53,240 --> 00:54:55,152
- All right, man. One.
- One.

1192
00:55:13,200 --> 00:55:14,998
Yo, what up, ma?

1193
00:55:15,040 --> 00:55:16,997
My bad for showin' unexpectedly

1194
00:55:17,040 --> 00:55:19,191
But I need to holla
at you for a second, P

1195
00:55:19,240 --> 00:55:21,038
Yo, yo, yo, back up, dude

1196
00:55:21,040 --> 00:55:23,157
Motherfucker,
how 'bout I back up you?

1197
00:55:23,200 --> 00:55:24,236
Oh, shit.

1198
00:55:25,040 --> 00:55:26,076
nigga, you want some, too?

1199
00:55:26,080 --> 00:55:29,039
Sticky, what's wrong with you

1200
00:55:29,080 --> 00:55:30,116
Ain't nothing wrong with me

1201
00:55:30,120 --> 00:55:31,998
I'm perfectly sane, I just came

1202
00:55:32,080 --> 00:55:34,072
To tell you that I'm
gettin' outta the game

1203
00:55:34,080 --> 00:55:36,117
That's not what it
looks like from my side

1204
00:55:36,160 --> 00:55:38,197
Looks like you're about
to catch a double homicide

1205
00:55:40,160 --> 00:55:42,994
My bad, it's just motherfuckers now

1206
00:55:43,040 --> 00:55:44,076
They be makin' me mad

1207
00:55:44,120 --> 00:55:46,077
Come here, come here, let's talk

1208
00:55:46,080 --> 00:55:47,196
- Yo, you all right?
- It's all right, boys

1209
00:55:47,240 --> 00:55:49,994
- You can all go take a walk
- Okay.

1210
00:55:50,040 --> 00:55:51,156
I'm glad you came

1211
00:55:51,200 --> 00:55:54,113
So what's this talk about
you getting out of the game?

1212
00:55:54,160 --> 00:55:56,197
Yeah, yeah that's it for me

1213
00:55:56,200 --> 00:55:59,034
I'm all done, no more
movin' bricks for me

1214
00:55:59,080 --> 00:56:01,993
And it ain't 'cause
the police is hip to me

1215
00:56:02,040 --> 00:56:04,032
Or 'cause that nigga
Black put a hit on me

1216
00:56:04,080 --> 00:56:06,197
I'm just tired of
all the death drivin' me wild

1217
00:56:06,240 --> 00:56:09,074
I'm about to have a child,
move, start a new lifestyle

1218
00:56:09,120 --> 00:56:12,033
So, from now on,
you can deal with Tye and Phya

1219
00:56:12,080 --> 00:56:14,197
Hangin' up my guns,
I'm out, I retire

1220
00:56:14,200 --> 00:56:16,237
You think it's that easy?
Just like that?

1221
00:56:17,000 --> 00:56:18,116
Like I'm some bitch
that you fucked

1222
00:56:18,160 --> 00:56:19,230
And never called back?

1223
00:56:20,000 --> 00:56:21,195
- Yo, look, P-
- No, no, don't look, P me

1224
00:56:21,240 --> 00:56:24,039
I have a shipment coming in, 350 ki's

1225
00:56:24,080 --> 00:56:25,070
My boys'll make the pickup

1226
00:56:25,120 --> 00:56:27,032
And you'll get your bread

1227
00:56:27,080 --> 00:56:29,117
One's a trigger-happy cop-killer,
and one's a coke head

1228
00:56:29,160 --> 00:56:31,994
Now, you tell me,
what am I supposed to do?

1229
00:56:32,040 --> 00:56:34,236
Depend on those idiots
in your so-called crew?

1230
00:56:35,000 --> 00:56:37,071
P, I know you got a shipment,
I'm just tryin' to help you

1231
00:56:37,120 --> 00:56:38,190
But I'm out, that's it

1232
00:56:38,240 --> 00:56:40,152
I don't know what to tell you

1233
00:56:40,200 --> 00:56:43,034
Yo, you walk away
from me, you're dead

1234
00:56:43,080 --> 00:56:45,151
You hear me? You're dead!

1235
00:57:04,240 --> 00:57:06,072
Hey, yo, what up, dawg?

1236
00:57:06,120 --> 00:57:08,112
Holdin' my head
as much as possible

1237
00:57:08,120 --> 00:57:10,191
- How Phya doin'?
- Doin' good, still in the hospital

1238
00:57:10,240 --> 00:57:13,039
- Sure you ready?
- For my seed? Do what I gots to

1239
00:57:13,080 --> 00:57:16,039
- All right, be safe
- Man, I'm shootin' through these obstacles

1240
00:57:16,080 --> 00:57:18,151
Listen, first we got
passports, all in new names

1241
00:57:18,200 --> 00:57:21,113
So, you shouldn't have
no problem boardin' a plane

1242
00:57:21,120 --> 00:57:23,157
Got a private jet waiting
that can leave when you're ready

1243
00:57:23,200 --> 00:57:26,193
Can take you to a major
port 00 miles from the city

1244
00:57:26,240 --> 00:57:28,994
Got a man on the inside
if you feel you in trouble

1245
00:57:29,040 --> 00:57:31,191
'Cause knowin' you,
you got a few mil in a duffle

1246
00:57:31,240 --> 00:57:34,074
Parachutes in the duffle
if you really in trouble

1247
00:57:34,120 --> 00:57:35,190
- Yo, you serious?
- Yeah, dawg

1248
00:57:35,200 --> 00:57:36,998
I'm feelin' your struggle

1249
00:57:37,040 --> 00:57:39,111
See, that's why I fuck
with you, O, for real

1250
00:57:39,160 --> 00:57:41,994
When it come down to it,

1251
00:57:42,040 --> 00:57:43,190
I owe you big over this one

1252
00:57:43,200 --> 00:57:45,999
Spades, in fact, it might
take a little while

1253
00:57:46,040 --> 00:57:48,077
- But I'm gonna pay that back
- My nigga, no worries here

1254
00:57:48,120 --> 00:57:49,236
I don't give to receive

1255
00:57:49,240 --> 00:57:52,074
My gift is you being present
when they deliver your seed

1256
00:57:52,120 --> 00:57:55,033
See, that's what I mean,
we like family, yo

1257
00:57:55,080 --> 00:57:57,151
Only a nigga like you
could understand me, yo

1258
00:57:57,200 --> 00:57:58,236
Ay, yo, good lookin', nigga

1259
00:57:58,240 --> 00:58:00,152
Come on, dawg,
you know I got your back

1260
00:58:00,200 --> 00:58:03,079
- I owe you one
- Knock it off, you don't owe me jack

1261
00:58:03,080 --> 00:58:05,197
- Hold it down
- You know me, I ain't got a choice

1262
00:58:05,240 --> 00:58:08,119
- I'm still bad
- Yeah, I know, I hear it in your voice

1263
00:58:08,160 --> 00:58:10,231
Yo, I heard some shit,
on the wire, this killer

1264
00:58:10,240 --> 00:58:12,038
This chick name Sheila

1265
00:58:12,080 --> 00:58:14,072
- Told me Black is a squealer
- What? Who?

1266
00:58:14,120 --> 00:58:16,077
Sheila, I know her from D.C.

1267
00:58:16,120 --> 00:58:17,190
Was a cop on one of my blocks

1268
00:58:17,200 --> 00:58:19,032
Now she a D.T.

1269
00:58:19,080 --> 00:58:21,072
Said Black been workin'
with the Feds for a minute

1270
00:58:21,080 --> 00:58:24,039
That motherfucker
need to be shot dead on the premises

1271
00:58:24,080 --> 00:58:25,116
Yo, hold up, man, I'm sayin'

1272
00:58:25,160 --> 00:58:26,196
Is this source reliable?

1273
00:58:26,200 --> 00:58:29,079
Of course, dawg, besides,
did I ever lie to you?

1274
00:58:29,120 --> 00:58:31,112
Nah, man, but this
some unthinkable shit

1275
00:58:31,160 --> 00:58:32,196
If what you say is true

1276
00:58:32,240 --> 00:58:34,152
- Then I'm on a sinking ship
- I know.

1277
00:58:34,200 --> 00:58:36,157
Me and dude's in
the middle of an all-out war

1278
00:58:36,200 --> 00:58:37,236
And what for?

1279
00:58:37,240 --> 00:58:39,118
So he could call me out to the law?

1280
00:58:39,160 --> 00:58:42,039
That's the same motherfuckin' reason
that I told you for

1281
00:58:42,080 --> 00:58:45,039
You can't be sleeping
on the streets, nigga, dozing off

1282
00:58:45,040 --> 00:58:46,110
You know I got your back, homeboy

1283
00:58:46,160 --> 00:58:48,152
You's my man, now
get your ass on the plane

1284
00:58:48,240 --> 00:58:50,994
- And hit me up when you land
- Ay, yo, good lookin', nigga.

1285
00:58:51,040 --> 00:58:52,235
Come on, dawg,
you know I got your back

1286
00:58:53,000 --> 00:58:55,117
- Man, I owe you one
- Knock if off, you don't owe me jack

1287
00:58:55,160 --> 00:58:58,039
- Hold it down
- You know me, I ain't got a choice

1288
00:58:58,080 --> 00:59:01,152
- I'm still bad
- Yeah, I know, I hear it in your voice

1289
00:59:31,240 --> 00:59:33,118
- Hello
- How are you?

1290
00:59:33,120 --> 00:59:34,998
- I'm good, and you?
- Fine

1291
00:59:35,040 --> 00:59:37,032
- What floor you goin' to?
- Can you press number 5?

1292
00:59:37,080 --> 00:59:40,039
- We having some nice weather, huh?
- Yeah, it's nice

1293
00:59:40,040 --> 00:59:42,157
- You need some help with your bags?
- Oh, that's all right

1294
00:59:44,080 --> 00:59:46,197
- Okay, now, bye
- You have a nice day

1295
00:59:46,240 --> 00:59:48,072
- You, too
- I'll try

1296
00:59:52,240 --> 00:59:54,197
- Are you okay, can I help you?
- Yeah, sweetie

1297
00:59:54,240 --> 00:59:55,993
Everything's fine

1298
00:59:56,040 --> 00:59:58,077
We just makin' a delivery at room 39

1299
00:59:58,120 --> 00:59:59,110
Oh, it's right there

1300
00:59:59,120 --> 01:00:00,156
The 5th door on the left side

1301
01:00:00,200 --> 01:00:02,078
Okay, thank you

1302
01:00:02,080 --> 01:00:03,116
Oh, don't mention it, anytime

1303
01:00:24,120 --> 01:00:25,998
What kinda gangsta is you

1304
01:00:26,040 --> 01:00:28,032
In the hospital hidin' out?

1305
01:00:28,080 --> 01:00:30,197
Well, it's time to put the fire out

1306
01:00:32,000 --> 01:00:33,036
What the fuck is this?

1307
01:00:34,160 --> 01:00:35,196
Ain't that a bitch?

1308
01:00:35,240 --> 01:00:38,119
If you move, dead, nigga, drop the gun

1309
01:00:38,120 --> 01:00:40,157
Who sent you? I know
that it was Black and them

1310
01:00:40,200 --> 01:00:42,078
You fightin' a war you can't win

1311
01:00:42,120 --> 01:00:43,110
You know that shit

1312
01:00:43,160 --> 01:00:44,230
If you gonna kill me, nigga, do it

1313
01:00:45,000 --> 01:00:45,990
Get it over with

1314
01:00:46,040 --> 01:00:47,076
Oh, yeah, you think you Biggie?

1315
01:00:47,120 --> 01:00:48,110
You ready to die?

1316
01:00:48,160 --> 01:00:49,992
- Do it, nigga
- Goodbye, bitch

1317
01:00:50,040 --> 01:00:51,190
Tell God I said hi

1318
01:01:15,040 --> 01:01:15,996
There's someone at the hospital.

1319
01:01:16,040 --> 01:01:17,110
Someone, help, please.

1320
01:01:17,160 --> 01:01:18,196
No, they're shooting.

1321
01:01:38,080 --> 01:01:39,230
Oh, my God, Sticky

1322
01:01:40,040 --> 01:01:42,032
What's wrong with you?
I left a thousand messages

1323
01:01:42,080 --> 01:01:43,992
I've been calling you, calling you

1324
01:01:44,040 --> 01:01:45,190
I had a bad feeling
ever since you left

1325
01:01:45,240 --> 01:01:47,072
Don't ever do that to me again

1326
01:01:47,120 --> 01:01:48,156
You had me scared to death

1327
01:01:48,200 --> 01:01:50,078
Baby, baby, calm down

1328
01:01:50,080 --> 01:01:52,072
- Everything is all right
- Okay, you okay?

1329
01:01:52,120 --> 01:01:54,112
- Yeah, I'm all right
- Thank God

1330
01:01:54,120 --> 01:01:56,077
I almost had a heart attack because of you

1331
01:01:56,120 --> 01:01:58,237
I just wanted to tell you, baby,
that I love you

1332
01:01:59,040 --> 01:02:01,111
I love you, too, ma, I love you more

1333
01:02:01,120 --> 01:02:03,191
Now, listen to me carefully,
our time runnin' short

1334
01:02:03,240 --> 01:02:06,074
Pack one bag light enough
to go on board

1335
01:02:06,120 --> 01:02:08,077
I'm picking you up,
and we headed to the airport

1336
01:02:08,160 --> 01:02:10,072
- What did you do?
- Nothing

1337
01:02:10,120 --> 01:02:11,236
- Promise me
- I promise

1338
01:02:11,240 --> 01:02:13,232
I ain't do nothing,
what, you don't trust me?

1339
01:02:14,040 --> 01:02:15,235
I trust you, I love you, you are my heart

1340
01:02:16,000 --> 01:02:18,196
I just don't wanna
see you get ripped apart

1341
01:02:38,240 --> 01:02:41,074
Before I met you, Heaven,
swear I was livin' in hell

1342
01:02:41,120 --> 01:02:43,112
And If I hurt you girl,
don't think I could forgive myself

1343
01:02:43,160 --> 01:02:45,117
It's not that, I know you wouldn't

1344
01:02:45,160 --> 01:02:46,992
Hurt me intentionally,
just don't wanna

1345
01:02:47,040 --> 01:02:48,997
See you end up dead
or in a penitentiary

1346
01:02:49,040 --> 01:02:51,077
Promise when we leave,
you gon' start livin' right

1347
01:02:51,120 --> 01:02:52,156
I won't live a double life

1348
01:02:52,160 --> 01:02:54,072
- Like my brother Isaiah
- Who?

1349
01:02:54,120 --> 01:02:56,077
My brother Isaiah,
well, my stepbrother

1350
01:02:56,120 --> 01:02:58,157
He always in trouble,
if it's not one thing, it's another

1351
01:02:58,160 --> 01:03:01,119
I can't lie, ma, yeah, I got caught up
in the game

1352
01:03:01,160 --> 01:03:03,152
But, I put it all behind me when we
step on that plane

1353
01:03:03,200 --> 01:03:04,190
I hope so.

1354
01:03:25,240 --> 01:03:27,152
Luckywe showed up
when we did, boy

1355
01:03:27,200 --> 01:03:29,192
- Them niggas tried to dead you
- Yeah, yeah, yeah.

1356
01:03:29,200 --> 01:03:30,998
Now what you want, a medal?

1357
01:03:31,080 --> 01:03:33,072
I know this surgeon
that works this crib

1358
01:03:33,080 --> 01:03:34,196
Forget the doctors, you always said

1359
01:03:34,240 --> 01:03:36,152
It's worse than it is-

1360
01:03:36,200 --> 01:03:37,190
- You ain't Supernigga
- Damn!

1361
01:03:37,240 --> 01:03:39,038
You need medical attention

1362
01:03:39,080 --> 01:03:40,230
Phya, don't be stupid

1363
01:03:41,000 --> 01:03:42,150
When you start hitting the blow?

1364
01:03:42,200 --> 01:03:44,078
Don't worry about it, cousin

1365
01:03:44,120 --> 01:03:45,190
Why you wanna know?

1366
01:03:46,000 --> 01:03:47,150
Ever since y'all left New York

1367
01:03:47,200 --> 01:03:49,192
It seems like the whole family
been falling apart

1368
01:03:49,200 --> 01:03:52,079
I mean, when's the last time
we had a heart to heart?

1369
01:03:52,160 --> 01:03:53,992
I ain't with that sentimental shit

1370
01:03:54,040 --> 01:03:55,156
nigga, don't start-!

1371
01:03:55,200 --> 01:03:57,032
Oh, you need a doctor, quick

1372
01:03:57,040 --> 01:03:58,076
I don't feel pain

1373
01:03:58,160 --> 01:03:59,196
It's like I never got hit

1374
01:03:59,240 --> 01:04:01,232
You hard-headed,
you don't listen to shit

1375
01:04:02,040 --> 01:04:04,236
You know Stick gettin' out the game
and havin' a kid?

1376
01:04:04,240 --> 01:04:07,153
- What? Who told you that?
- He told me

1377
01:04:07,200 --> 01:04:09,112
When niggas tried
to kill us on the Ave

1378
01:04:09,160 --> 01:04:11,197
Shit got ill, we turned guerilla fast

1379
01:04:11,240 --> 01:04:13,994
And your boy, Killer Mike,
was running niggas into mass

1380
01:04:14,040 --> 01:04:15,156
Just gimme my gat

1381
01:04:16,200 --> 01:04:17,190
He good, man

1382
01:04:17,200 --> 01:04:19,032
With my own life I vouch for him

1383
01:04:19,080 --> 01:04:21,037
That's your life, nigga,
I'm gonna hold you to that

1384
01:04:24,240 --> 01:04:25,993
What the fuck you doing?

1385
01:04:26,040 --> 01:04:28,032
What the fuck did you just do?

1386
01:04:28,080 --> 01:04:31,198
Are you crazy?

1387
01:04:31,240 --> 01:04:33,152
God damn.

1388
01:04:33,200 --> 01:04:35,157
Yo, what up? This is Phya,
what's good?

1389
01:04:36,240 --> 01:04:39,039
- Tell me, what's really hood?
- Yo.

1390
01:04:39,040 --> 01:04:40,156
Yeah, son, I'm out the hospital

1391
01:04:40,200 --> 01:04:42,999
- Start thinkin', man
- Had the blaze, had to pop, too

1392
01:04:44,120 --> 01:04:46,077
You can't be serious

1393
01:04:46,080 --> 01:04:48,117
Word? You can't be serious

1394
01:04:48,160 --> 01:04:50,038
Aw, man, where they headed?

1395
01:04:50,040 --> 01:04:52,111
I'm coked out, wilin' out niggas
'bout to get deaded

1396
01:04:52,160 --> 01:04:54,197
What happened now?
Come on, hit me with it

1397
01:04:54,240 --> 01:04:57,039
- Holla back
- Go ahead, nigga, hit me with it

1398
01:04:57,080 --> 01:04:59,151
Damn, I ain't even see this shit

1399
01:04:59,160 --> 01:05:01,152
To the airport,
damn, I can't believe this shit

1400
01:09:11,240 --> 01:09:13,118
There was a shootout at the hospital

1401
01:09:13,160 --> 01:09:15,117
We have units in route, but get this

1402
01:09:15,160 --> 01:09:17,038
Guess who was registered to the room

1403
01:09:17,120 --> 01:09:18,156
Don't tell me

1404
01:09:18,200 --> 01:09:20,112
Stick's first cousin Phya

1405
01:09:20,160 --> 01:09:22,117
Ever since he came here,
the death toll got higher

1406
01:09:22,120 --> 01:09:23,190
Yeah, I could imagine

1407
01:09:23,240 --> 01:09:25,038
But wait, it gets worse

1408
01:09:25,040 --> 01:09:27,032
We have a positive I.D. from a nurse

1409
01:09:27,120 --> 01:09:28,236
She said Stick's brother BamBam

1410
01:09:29,000 --> 01:09:30,070
Came in like a mad man

1411
01:09:30,120 --> 01:09:33,079
- Killed three people
- Took Phya and ran

1412
01:09:33,120 --> 01:09:36,079
If you ask me, their operation's
about to nose dive

1413
01:09:36,120 --> 01:09:37,998
Turns out Killer Mike
was playing both sides

1414
01:09:38,040 --> 01:09:40,077
Okay, where's Grant and Lou?

1415
01:09:40,120 --> 01:09:41,156
I think they're runnin' surveillance

1416
01:09:41,160 --> 01:09:43,117
On Stick and his crew

1417
01:10:10,160 --> 01:10:12,117
Listen here, fuck the bullshit

1418
01:10:12,160 --> 01:10:14,072
I ain't trying to be
standin' at the lobby, yo

1419
01:10:14,120 --> 01:10:17,033
You sure you spoke to
my contact at the Bellagio?

1420
01:10:17,080 --> 01:10:18,116
Do they know I'm comin'?

1421
01:10:18,120 --> 01:10:19,156
Yeah, boss, everybody know

1422
01:10:19,200 --> 01:10:20,236
The fight is sold out

1423
01:10:20,240 --> 01:10:22,072
But you got seats
right beside the rope

1424
01:10:22,120 --> 01:10:25,033
Good, good, call up Bobby Joe

1425
01:10:25,080 --> 01:10:26,070
At the escort service

1426
01:10:26,120 --> 01:10:27,156
Tell him I need a party ho

1427
01:10:27,200 --> 01:10:29,157
I already did,
he's sending that bitch

1428
01:10:29,200 --> 01:10:31,032
- From the Ferrari show
- What?

1429
01:10:31,080 --> 01:10:33,072
Get another bitch,
fuck that retarded ho

1430
01:10:33,080 --> 01:10:34,070
All right, whatever you want

1431
01:10:34,120 --> 01:10:36,032
You know I'm on that, shit

1432
01:10:36,120 --> 01:10:38,112
You the boss, you the one
that's signing the checks

1433
01:10:38,160 --> 01:10:39,150
- Damn right.
- Hello?

1434
01:10:42,080 --> 01:10:43,150
Aw, shit.

1435
01:10:43,200 --> 01:10:45,112
Hey, boss, it's your big brother

1436
01:10:45,120 --> 01:10:46,156
I think he found out what happened

1437
01:10:46,200 --> 01:10:48,032
He on the phone, he wanna talk

1438
01:10:48,080 --> 01:10:49,150
And he don't sound happy

1439
01:10:51,040 --> 01:10:53,077
Jesus Christ,
did you say something?

1440
01:10:53,080 --> 01:10:54,992
Hell, no. I like my life

1441
01:10:55,080 --> 01:10:56,070
- What's up big bro?
- What?

1442
01:10:56,120 --> 01:10:58,032
Don't what's up me, nigga

1443
01:10:58,040 --> 01:11:00,077
Is you just playing dumb
and you tryin' to fuck me, nigga?

1444
01:11:00,120 --> 01:11:03,033
You say them New York niggas
ain't pose no threat

1445
01:11:03,080 --> 01:11:04,150
But we losin' money, niggas are dyin'

1446
01:11:04,200 --> 01:11:05,236
The Feds breathin' down my neck

1447
01:11:05,240 --> 01:11:07,038
Whoa, whoa, wait a minute, bro

1448
01:11:07,080 --> 01:11:08,070
Ain't no need to get upset

1449
01:11:08,120 --> 01:11:09,110
I can handle it

1450
01:11:09,160 --> 01:11:10,230
Then why the shit ain't handled yet?

1451
01:11:11,040 --> 01:11:12,110
Just give me one week

1452
01:11:12,120 --> 01:11:13,236
I swear I'll have the shit and smack

1453
01:11:13,240 --> 01:11:15,038
You got one day

1454
01:11:15,080 --> 01:11:17,072
Or I'm gonna put a bullet
in your ass, nigga

1455
01:11:38,160 --> 01:11:39,992
So, what's up, bossolini?

1456
01:11:40,040 --> 01:11:41,110
What you want me to do?

1457
01:11:41,120 --> 01:11:44,079
You wanna head to LV
or tally up the crew?

1458
01:11:44,120 --> 01:11:46,157
What? I ain't paying
that nigga no mind

1459
01:11:46,200 --> 01:11:47,998
We going to Vegas, see the fight

1460
01:11:48,040 --> 01:11:49,997
Make sure we on time

1461
01:11:50,040 --> 01:11:51,997
Okay, whatever you say

1462
01:11:52,080 --> 01:11:53,116
Man, what the hell is you doing?

1463
01:11:53,120 --> 01:11:54,156
Put that gun away

1464
01:11:54,200 --> 01:11:56,112
Besides, you can't bring no gun

1465
01:11:56,160 --> 01:11:59,039
- On no goddamn plane
- Relax, I know the security team

1466
01:11:59,080 --> 01:12:00,150
We could bring anything

1467
01:12:10,160 --> 01:12:12,197
Man, this nigga here must be
the goofiest nigga alive

1468
01:12:13,000 --> 01:12:15,037
Rollin' around here with drug money
and guns up in his ride

1469
01:12:15,080 --> 01:12:17,197
You would think they'd know
they're under investigation

1470
01:12:17,240 --> 01:12:19,232
Man, I can't wait to get this nigga
here down to the station

1471
01:12:20,040 --> 01:12:22,032
- Look, he's pullin' off
- Follow him, nigga

1472
01:12:22,040 --> 01:12:23,190
- See where he lead us
- Okay

1473
01:12:23,240 --> 01:12:25,232
But stay back a few cars,
nigga, so they don't see us

1474
01:12:34,240 --> 01:12:36,152
I'm gonna call in for backup

1475
01:12:36,200 --> 01:12:38,078
- No, don't call for no backup yet
- Why?

1476
01:12:38,120 --> 01:12:40,077
Just stay on his tail,
he might take us to his connect

1477
01:12:40,120 --> 01:12:41,236
- I don't know, man.
- Look, white boy,

1478
01:12:41,240 --> 01:12:43,038
just do what I say, all right?

1479
01:12:43,080 --> 01:12:45,037
Know how much press we'll get
if we crack this case?

1480
01:12:45,040 --> 01:12:46,156
Is that all you care about?

1481
01:12:46,200 --> 01:12:48,078
Seeing your name in the paper?

1482
01:12:48,160 --> 01:12:50,197
I thought being a cop was being
about making it safer

1483
01:12:50,200 --> 01:12:52,157
- Okay?
- Follow him, nigga

1484
01:13:28,040 --> 01:13:31,112
Hey, boss, you said you'd go and kill
that nigga Stick when you catch him

1485
01:13:31,160 --> 01:13:33,117
Well, there he go,
right there, walking with Heaven

1486
01:13:33,120 --> 01:13:35,999
Whoever bring me his head
is a hundred grand richer

1487
01:13:37,080 --> 01:13:38,992
And get my sister

1488
01:13:39,040 --> 01:13:40,156
Heaven, get moving, girl,
we gotta run for cover

1489
01:13:40,200 --> 01:13:42,032
Wait, I don't understand

1490
01:13:42,080 --> 01:13:44,037
- Come on
- That's my stepbrother

1491
01:13:44,080 --> 01:13:45,230
- What? Stepbrother?
- Yeah

1492
01:13:45,240 --> 01:13:48,039
That ugly motherfucker your stepbrother?

1493
01:13:48,080 --> 01:13:49,230
His father's my mother's husband

1494
01:13:49,240 --> 01:13:50,230
What's going on?

1495
01:13:51,040 --> 01:13:52,110
Why they shooting?
Whywe running?

1496
01:13:52,160 --> 01:13:54,197
How could you do this?
I loved you, you set me up

1497
01:13:54,240 --> 01:13:57,039
You ain't tell me that your brother
was that fat fuck

1498
01:13:57,080 --> 01:13:58,070
What? No

1499
01:13:58,080 --> 01:13:59,150
What are you talking about?

1500
01:13:59,200 --> 01:14:01,237
I told you about Isaiah
when you called my house

1501
01:14:01,240 --> 01:14:03,197
Yeah, about Black Ike,
Who the fuck is Isaiah?

1502
01:14:03,240 --> 01:14:06,039
They the same person-
Ike is short for Isaiah

1503
01:14:06,080 --> 01:14:08,117
- Ain't that Black's main ride?
- Yeah, that's Stick's GT

1504
01:14:08,160 --> 01:14:09,150
Hope we ain't too late

1505
01:14:09,200 --> 01:14:11,032
You ready? Cock your heat

1506
01:14:15,120 --> 01:14:16,156
We gotta do something

1507
01:14:16,200 --> 01:14:18,078
Aren't we supposed to be the police?

1508
01:14:18,120 --> 01:14:19,998
Man, them low-life niggas
ain't gonna bust on me

1509
01:14:20,040 --> 01:14:22,077
So we just sit here
and watch it unfold while you eat?

1510
01:14:22,080 --> 01:14:23,196
Man, think about it like it's the movies

1511
01:14:23,240 --> 01:14:25,118
We got front row seats

1512
01:14:29,160 --> 01:14:31,117
- Where did they go?
- I don't know

1513
01:14:31,120 --> 01:14:32,156
They couldn't went far, but go outside

1514
01:14:32,200 --> 01:14:33,998
In case they double back to the car

1515
01:14:34,080 --> 01:14:36,037
Are you insane?
You was gonna take a gun on the plane?

1516
01:14:36,080 --> 01:14:38,117
But you promised me
you would leave behind the game

1517
01:14:38,160 --> 01:14:41,119
And I will, as soon as we get in the air

1518
01:14:41,120 --> 01:14:43,112
But I'm keeping the gun
till I know that we're in the clear

1519
01:14:44,160 --> 01:14:46,038
You heard that?

1520
01:14:46,080 --> 01:14:47,116
That motherfucker
around here somewhere

1521
01:14:47,160 --> 01:14:49,072
- Give me that gat
- Should I speak to him?

1522
01:14:49,120 --> 01:14:51,032
I might could talk
some sense in his head

1523
01:14:51,080 --> 01:14:52,230
Nah, we way past that,
too much blood been shed

1524
01:14:52,240 --> 01:14:54,118
- Now quiet
- Okay

1525
01:14:54,200 --> 01:14:56,157
Follow me this way,
we'll be out this hell hole

1526
01:14:56,200 --> 01:14:58,157
- If we could make it to the plane
- You outgunned

1527
01:14:58,200 --> 01:15:00,032
- Oh, shit
- Two to one

1528
01:15:00,040 --> 01:15:01,076
Come here, baby girl

1529
01:15:01,080 --> 01:15:02,116
You drop your gun

1530
01:15:02,160 --> 01:15:03,992
No, you drop your gun right now

1531
01:15:04,040 --> 01:15:05,110
- Or I'm gonna blaze you
- Sis.

1532
01:15:05,200 --> 01:15:07,112
I'm not going
anywhere with you, I hate you

1533
01:15:07,160 --> 01:15:09,117
What lies did you tell her
to turn her against me?

1534
01:15:09,160 --> 01:15:11,072
I'm not gonna rest until you're 6 feet deep

1535
01:15:11,120 --> 01:15:13,112
I think you're scared,
that's why you're in the car so long

1536
01:15:13,160 --> 01:15:15,072
We're city officials, punk,
we enforce the law

1537
01:15:15,120 --> 01:15:18,033
Punk? Look, why go in there
and get shot to hell

1538
01:15:18,080 --> 01:15:20,231
When we can just play clean-up, man,
and let them kill theyself?

1539
01:15:20,240 --> 01:15:22,152
Drop the gun right now,
or I'm gonna kill your wife

1540
01:15:22,200 --> 01:15:24,112
You're gonna kill your own sister, nigga?

1541
01:15:24,160 --> 01:15:26,197
- Fuck that bitch, I never liked her
- Hey, yo, Stick

1542
01:15:26,240 --> 01:15:28,038
- Phya
- Watch out, son

1543
01:15:28,080 --> 01:15:29,070
Oh, shit

1544
01:15:29,080 --> 01:15:30,116
Where'd they come from?

1545
01:16:33,160 --> 01:16:35,117
No. No! No!

1546
01:17:43,120 --> 01:17:45,112
Heaven? I thought I got killed

1547
01:17:45,160 --> 01:17:48,198
I just had the craziest dream,
and it felt so real

1548
01:17:48,240 --> 01:17:51,074
Dreamt you was the sister
of myworst enemy

1549
01:17:51,080 --> 01:17:53,197
He tried to kill my brother,
my cousin, my peoples and me

1550
01:17:53,240 --> 01:17:56,153
Everybodywas dying,
there was no one left

1551
01:17:56,200 --> 01:17:59,159
I remember trying to escape,
it was life or death

1552
01:17:59,200 --> 01:18:01,032
They had police trying to kill me

1553
01:18:01,080 --> 01:18:02,070
We was on the run

1554
01:18:02,120 --> 01:18:05,033
And you, you was pregnant,
having my son

1555
01:18:05,040 --> 01:18:07,191
Even O was in my dream,
he tried to help us get away

1556
01:18:08,000 --> 01:18:10,151
At least I think it was him,
I can't remember his face

1557
01:18:10,200 --> 01:18:13,113
He gave us fake passports
to get us out of the States

1558
01:18:13,160 --> 01:18:16,198
But there was a shoot-out
at the airport inside the gate

1559
01:18:16,240 --> 01:18:19,039
I thought I'd probably get popped
'cause of the price on my head

1560
01:18:19,080 --> 01:18:21,993
Or end up getting locked
and doing life in the fed

1561
01:18:22,040 --> 01:18:25,158
Then I woke up just as I was dying

1562
01:18:25,200 --> 01:18:28,238
What's the matter, Ma?
Why you crying?

1563
01:18:29,000 --> 01:18:30,150
It wasn't a dream

1564
01:18:30,240 --> 01:18:32,072
What? What do you mean?

1565
01:18:32,080 --> 01:18:34,037
- Of course it was a dream
- No

1566
01:18:34,080 --> 01:18:35,992
I got hit point-blank
with a sawed-off in the chest

1567
01:18:36,040 --> 01:18:39,158
- Baby
- Either I be dead or I be bleeding to death

1568
01:18:39,160 --> 01:18:42,073
Look

1569
01:18:44,120 --> 01:18:46,112
Oh, my God.

1570
01:18:46,120 --> 01:18:49,079
Oh, my God!

1571
01:19:03,120 --> 01:19:05,157
Somebody help!

1572
01:19:06,240 --> 01:19:08,994
Oh, God.

1573
01:19:11,200 --> 01:19:12,190
I'm right here, baby.

1574
01:19:21,040 --> 01:19:23,157
No.

1575
01:19:28,240 --> 01:19:30,038
No!

1576
01:19:46,160 --> 01:19:49,995
Oh, God. Oh, my God.

1577
01:19:53,160 --> 01:19:57,200
I'm right here, baby.

1578
01:19:57,200 --> 01:19:58,156
Stick.

1579
01:20:02,040 --> 01:20:03,030
No!
