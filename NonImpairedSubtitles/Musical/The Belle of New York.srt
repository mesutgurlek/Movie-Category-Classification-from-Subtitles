1
00:01:19,817 --> 00:01:24,696
And your heart bobs around like a cork

2
00:01:24,862 --> 00:01:36,664
When you're out
With the belle of Mew Yorh

3
00:01:39,208 --> 00:01:42,133
- There she is.
- Well, what are you all doing here?

4
00:01:42,168 --> 00:01:45,129
- Don't be loitering. Get moving.
- What is the word, men?

5
00:01:45,164 --> 00:01:47,381
- Fight.
- Right.

6
00:01:55,346 --> 00:01:58,515
Oh, Mrs. Hill, I thought you were
in Washington, I didn't know...

7
00:01:58,550 --> 00:02:01,723
- Hello, Angela.
- I finished my work a day earlier.

8
00:02:01,758 --> 00:02:04,896
How was Washington?
Did you see our congressman?

9
00:02:04,931 --> 00:02:07,857
Oh, yes.
And Angela, he was so handsome.

10
00:02:07,940 --> 00:02:09,900
Did you get his consent?

11
00:02:10,067 --> 00:02:12,611
The belle of New York.

12
00:02:13,903 --> 00:02:16,579
A fine title
for somebody in our type of work.

13
00:02:16,614 --> 00:02:21,076
Oh, it's only their way of showing
their love for our welfare house.

14
00:02:21,111 --> 00:02:25,538
Amazing how they've grown to love
our welfare house since you've grown.

15
00:02:25,573 --> 00:02:27,039
Miss Wilkins.

16
00:02:27,164 --> 00:02:29,958
Well, the important thing
is they do come here.

17
00:02:29,993 --> 00:02:32,043
But that look in their eyes.

18
00:02:32,210 --> 00:02:35,671
Not exactly the right kind of look
for men who are seeking guidance...

19
00:02:35,706 --> 00:02:37,482
...you know what I mean?

20
00:02:37,517 --> 00:02:39,223
Yes, I know what you mean.

21
00:02:39,258 --> 00:02:42,344
If it weren't for your parents
who built this welfare house...

22
00:02:42,385 --> 00:02:46,555
...I'd advise you
to choose some other type of career.

23
00:02:46,590 --> 00:02:50,726
Oh, but, Mrs. Hill
this has been my home. 'my life.

24
00:02:50,892 --> 00:02:55,354
And I've tried so hard to equip myself
for this kind of work.

25
00:02:55,563 --> 00:02:58,899
If you ask me, it's your equipment
that's causing all the...

26
00:02:58,934 --> 00:03:01,443
Miss Wilkins.

27
00:03:04,279 --> 00:03:06,656
Something has to be done.

28
00:03:06,822 --> 00:03:10,409
For the time being, I think it'd be
better if Ms. Wilkins sang the solo.

29
00:03:10,444 --> 00:03:12,410
The solo?

30
00:03:12,577 --> 00:03:14,120
But, Mrs. Hill...

31
00:03:14,287 --> 00:03:17,957
Oh, it's not your fault, Angela.

32
00:03:18,123 --> 00:03:20,584
If you were only a little plainer.

33
00:03:20,667 --> 00:03:23,878
- If you don't look so...
- So...?

34
00:03:24,045 --> 00:03:28,757
Well, if you only would look
a little more so-so than so.

35
00:03:33,386 --> 00:03:35,972
- Miss Wilkins, Miss Wilkins.
- Yes, Mrs. Hill?

36
00:03:36,007 --> 00:03:37,938
- Save your song for the meeting.
- Yes.

37
00:03:37,973 --> 00:03:40,851
- You do know the song, don't you?
- Oh, indeed.

38
00:03:40,886 --> 00:03:42,609
And, Mrs. Hill, don't worry.

39
00:03:42,644 --> 00:03:45,146
While I'm singing.
I'll try to look real plain.

40
00:03:45,181 --> 00:03:46,856
Yes, dear.

41
00:03:56,197 --> 00:03:57,823
Angela.

42
00:03:57,990 --> 00:04:01,159
- Angela, Angela, I haven't seen you since...
- Gilfred, please.

43
00:04:01,194 --> 00:04:04,329
Gilfred, you're getting that
moo-cow quality in your voice again.

44
00:04:04,364 --> 00:04:08,249
And that's exactly the thing
I'm trying to discourage.

45
00:04:11,751 --> 00:04:15,004
Good afternoon, gentlemen. Please.

46
00:04:15,171 --> 00:04:20,259
Now, those of you seeking true guidance
may quietly enter.

47
00:04:22,010 --> 00:04:25,013
Flowers for the fairest
flower of them all.

48
00:04:30,475 --> 00:04:35,146
Friends, it's most gratifying
to see so many of you here tonight.

49
00:04:36,355 --> 00:04:39,525
The fact that you have chosen
to spend your time here...

50
00:04:39,560 --> 00:04:41,359
...in these surroundings...

51
00:04:41,485 --> 00:04:46,447
...is proof that you have forsaken
your former hangouts...

52
00:04:46,614 --> 00:04:51,076
...those environments of sin
and temptation.

53
00:04:52,035 --> 00:04:55,121
We are proud
of the great number of you...

54
00:04:55,204 --> 00:05:00,417
...who have deserted the evil
of wine, women and song...

55
00:05:00,584 --> 00:05:06,214
...to embrace the virtues of
clean living and hard work.

56
00:05:08,132 --> 00:05:11,802
Yes, men, this is the life.

57
00:05:13,011 --> 00:05:16,764
This is the life.
Friends, it is most gratifying...

58
00:05:16,931 --> 00:05:19,725
...to see many of you here tonight
at my bachelor dinner.

59
00:05:19,760 --> 00:05:22,786
And even though
I'm getting married tomorrow...

60
00:05:22,821 --> 00:05:25,813
...I'll always remember
this old gang of mine.

61
00:05:26,731 --> 00:05:28,816
To you, my best pals.

62
00:05:28,982 --> 00:05:32,694
- Oh, Charlie.
- To you!

63
00:05:35,113 --> 00:05:37,698
- And now, to the bride.
- Oh, yes.

64
00:05:39,033 --> 00:05:41,166
To Dixie "Dead Shot" McCoy.
the bride-to-be.

65
00:05:41,201 --> 00:05:47,164
May she not be left waiting at the church
like the other five who tried to be.

66
00:05:49,708 --> 00:05:52,919
Charlie, how do you get all the women
to fall in love with you?

67
00:05:52,954 --> 00:05:54,625
Yes, Charlie, how do you do it?

68
00:05:54,660 --> 00:05:56,262
Well, it's nothing, really.

69
00:05:56,297 --> 00:05:59,049
I just wait at the stage door
with a bag of peanuts.

70
00:05:59,084 --> 00:06:00,884
Peanuts? What kind?

71
00:06:01,051 --> 00:06:04,220
Just peanuts. Then I present them
to the young lady and I say:

72
00:06:04,255 --> 00:06:07,389
"Here, they're for you.
I only wish they were diamonds. "

73
00:06:07,424 --> 00:06:09,933
Next thing I know, I'm engaged.

74
00:06:10,100 --> 00:06:12,644
- How cute.
- How adorable.

75
00:06:12,811 --> 00:06:15,063
- How nauseating.
- Max.

76
00:06:15,271 --> 00:06:16,862
Charles, I wanna talk to you.

77
00:06:16,897 --> 00:06:20,087
- Oh, no. Don't go.
- Not tonight, Charlie.

78
00:06:20,122 --> 00:06:23,278
- Now, listen, I'm your lawyer, right?
- Right.

79
00:06:23,445 --> 00:06:25,995
- You're my biggest client.
- I'm your only client.

80
00:06:26,030 --> 00:06:29,345
Right. Now, as your lawyer.
let me ask you one question.

81
00:06:29,380 --> 00:06:32,661
When your dear aunt finds out
about your blushing bride...

82
00:06:32,696 --> 00:06:34,871
...this human shooting gallery...

83
00:06:34,996 --> 00:06:36,831
...what do you suppose she will say?

84
00:06:36,866 --> 00:06:38,214
For a while, nothing.

85
00:06:38,249 --> 00:06:40,799
And her silence
will be positively profane.

86
00:06:40,834 --> 00:06:44,649
- She'll kick me out without a penny.
- And I'll starve to death.

87
00:06:44,684 --> 00:06:48,465
Well, Charlie, I've got to help you.
I mean, you're my best friend.

88
00:06:48,500 --> 00:06:50,349
- I'm your only friend.
- Well, exactly.

89
00:06:50,384 --> 00:06:53,761
I can't afford to let you do something
I'll be sorry for, now, can I?

90
00:06:53,796 --> 00:06:56,972
- Oh, we want a speech. Come on.
- Yes, dear.

91
00:07:00,017 --> 00:07:03,937
Well, there's nothing I can say
except goodbye...

92
00:07:04,062 --> 00:07:06,897
...and farewell to my bachelor days.

93
00:07:07,064 --> 00:07:09,066
So...

94
00:07:10,067 --> 00:07:13,445
Who wants to kiss the bridegroom

95
00:07:13,820 --> 00:07:16,197
On his last night out?

96
00:07:17,073 --> 00:07:20,325
Next time they bring champagne on

97
00:07:20,742 --> 00:07:24,037
I'll have the ball and chain on

98
00:07:24,204 --> 00:07:27,498
Yes, ladies, I must leave you

99
00:07:27,665 --> 00:07:30,042
I regret to say

100
00:07:30,167 --> 00:07:31,751
I've bought the ring

101
00:07:31,918 --> 00:07:33,461
This little fling

102
00:07:33,628 --> 00:07:36,964
Will have to be our last soiree

103
00:07:37,131 --> 00:07:40,425
Because they're putting me away

104
00:07:40,592 --> 00:07:44,178
And tomorrow is the happy day

105
00:07:44,721 --> 00:07:48,057
I'll be the starry-eyed groom

106
00:07:48,224 --> 00:07:50,684
By high noon, no doubt

107
00:07:51,184 --> 00:07:54,854
So who wants to kiss the bridegroom

108
00:07:55,271 --> 00:07:57,565
On his last night out?

109
00:07:58,565 --> 00:08:01,651
Who wants to kiss the bridegroom

110
00:08:01,818 --> 00:08:04,737
On his last night out?

111
00:08:05,279 --> 00:08:08,616
Next time they bring champagne on

112
00:08:08,782 --> 00:08:12,160
He'll have the ball and chain on

113
00:08:12,327 --> 00:08:15,413
Yes, ladies, I must leave you

114
00:08:15,872 --> 00:08:18,207
I regret to say

115
00:08:18,374 --> 00:08:19,917
I've bought the ring

116
00:08:20,083 --> 00:08:21,501
This little fling

117
00:08:21,668 --> 00:08:25,004
Will have to be our last soiree

118
00:08:25,171 --> 00:08:28,507
Because they're putting me away

119
00:08:28,632 --> 00:08:32,093
And tomorrow is the happy day

120
00:08:32,260 --> 00:08:35,888
Oh, he'll be a starry-eyed groom

121
00:08:36,055 --> 00:08:38,932
By high noon, no doubt

122
00:08:39,099 --> 00:08:42,894
So who wants to kiss the bridegroom

123
00:08:43,228 --> 00:08:45,980
On his last night out?

124
00:09:43,945 --> 00:09:46,072
Oh, Charles.

125
00:09:46,239 --> 00:09:48,199
Stop this. Stop it at once.

126
00:09:48,240 --> 00:09:52,452
Get down off that table.
All of you. And get out of here!

127
00:09:52,535 --> 00:09:57,456
Go on, shoo. Get out of my house.
Go on, shoo. Get out of my house.

128
00:09:58,040 --> 00:09:59,875
Charles!

129
00:10:01,001 --> 00:10:02,981
What's the meaning of this?

130
00:10:03,016 --> 00:10:04,962
Who is that unclad creature?

131
00:10:05,129 --> 00:10:07,638
And what are those obscene remarks
she's making?

132
00:10:07,673 --> 00:10:10,932
- It's not obscene, it's French.
- French is obscene.

133
00:10:10,967 --> 00:10:14,262
- What is the meaning of this. "obscene"?
- That means you better go.

134
00:10:14,297 --> 00:10:18,057
- Very well, then, I obscene.
- Oh, the very id...

135
00:10:18,307 --> 00:10:19,808
What's that?

136
00:10:20,142 --> 00:10:23,728
Oh, that, It's a kind of a girl.

137
00:10:23,895 --> 00:10:26,404
That much is obvious.
Why is she hung up here?

138
00:10:26,439 --> 00:10:31,610
Well, she was sort of a guest of honor.
You see, she's getting married tomorrow.

139
00:10:31,645 --> 00:10:34,279
And just how does that affect you?

140
00:10:34,445 --> 00:10:38,449
Well, she's going to marry
a very good friend of mine.

141
00:10:38,616 --> 00:10:41,910
Marriage to a woman like that
ought to be prohibited by law.

142
00:10:41,945 --> 00:10:45,555
- You're so right.
- Charles, what am I gonna do about you?

143
00:10:45,590 --> 00:10:49,166
You've been a problem
from the day you learned how to whistle.

144
00:10:49,201 --> 00:10:51,216
- Aunt Letty, I can explain.
- Oh, not now.

145
00:10:51,251 --> 00:10:54,796
I've had a long trip and I'm tired.
We'll discuss this in the morning.

146
00:10:54,831 --> 00:10:56,179
Good night, Aunt Letty.

147
00:10:56,214 --> 00:11:00,300
And when you leave.
take Buffalo Bill with you.

148
00:11:11,518 --> 00:11:15,354
- The back of your neck, she look so sad.
- Yeah.

149
00:11:15,521 --> 00:11:19,191
And your face.
it doesn't want to get married.

150
00:11:19,316 --> 00:11:22,986
No, In fact, none of me does.

151
00:11:26,197 --> 00:11:28,657
Charlie, if you feel like this
about marriage...

152
00:11:28,692 --> 00:11:31,249
...why so many times you get engaged?

153
00:11:31,284 --> 00:11:34,412
Well, I'm sincere when I ask them
and then something happens.

154
00:11:34,447 --> 00:11:36,629
- What happens?
- Oh, I don't know.

155
00:11:36,664 --> 00:11:40,834
I guess I just seem to lose interest in
any girl who'd marry a fellow like me.

156
00:11:40,869 --> 00:11:44,837
If there is love,
happiness will find you

157
00:11:45,004 --> 00:11:49,091
And cloudy days soon will be behind you

158
00:11:49,258 --> 00:11:52,344
If there is love in your life

159
00:11:52,510 --> 00:11:54,310
Harrison, why are we stopping here?

160
00:11:54,345 --> 00:11:57,431
There's a trash wagon ahead, sir.
and they won't let us through.

161
00:11:57,466 --> 00:12:01,810
If there is joy, you can banish sorrow

162
00:12:01,977 --> 00:12:04,103
Give old Lucifer a shove

163
00:12:04,270 --> 00:12:06,279
You can light your way above

164
00:12:06,314 --> 00:12:09,525
If you let a little love in your life

165
00:12:09,691 --> 00:12:11,068
Come in and

166
00:12:11,234 --> 00:12:13,319
Let a little love
Let a little love

167
00:12:13,354 --> 00:12:15,442
- Let a little love come in
_Come in!

168
00:12:15,477 --> 00:12:17,400
Let a little love
Let a little love

169
00:12:17,435 --> 00:12:19,289
- Let a little love come in
_Come in!

170
00:12:19,324 --> 00:12:21,993
We're losing them, Angela.
You'll have to take over.

171
00:12:22,028 --> 00:12:23,787
- Should I?
- Oh, sure.

172
00:12:23,953 --> 00:12:26,330
Give a little shove
Light your way above

173
00:12:26,365 --> 00:12:29,875
Let a little love come in

174
00:12:30,542 --> 00:12:32,127
What?

175
00:12:32,460 --> 00:12:38,257
Let there be love in your life

176
00:12:38,424 --> 00:12:43,928
If there is love,
happiness will find you

177
00:12:44,095 --> 00:12:48,932
And cloudy days soon will be behind you

178
00:12:49,099 --> 00:12:51,893
Charlie, Charlie.

179
00:12:52,811 --> 00:12:56,439
- To home, please.
- Aren't you going to wait for him, ma'am?

180
00:12:56,474 --> 00:12:59,775
I pity the woman who waits for him.

181
00:13:00,525 --> 00:13:06,405
If there is joy, you can banish sorrow

182
00:13:06,572 --> 00:13:09,074
Give old Lucifer a shove

183
00:13:09,241 --> 00:13:11,910
You can light your way above

184
00:13:12,077 --> 00:13:17,206
If you let a little love in your life

185
00:13:22,294 --> 00:13:26,262
Miss Bonfils will now distribute some
copies of our magazine, free of charge.

186
00:13:26,297 --> 00:13:32,260
It would be very nice to hear the generous
jingle of a few coins in the tambourine.

187
00:13:33,303 --> 00:13:35,812
- Angela.
- I'll have a magazine, please.

188
00:13:35,847 --> 00:13:39,058
I'll treasure this all my life.
I'll sleep with it under my pillow.

189
00:13:39,093 --> 00:13:41,893
- Would do you more good if you read it.
- I'll take one.

190
00:13:41,928 --> 00:13:43,228
I'll take one.

191
00:13:43,395 --> 00:13:44,854
Bless you, brother.

192
00:13:46,230 --> 00:13:48,544
I'll have a magazine, please.

193
00:13:48,579 --> 00:13:50,859
But you've already... Here.

194
00:13:51,026 --> 00:13:52,777
- I'll take one, please.
- One for me.

195
00:13:52,812 --> 00:13:54,487
- Bless you, brother.
- And me.

196
00:13:54,522 --> 00:13:56,572
I'd like one, please.

197
00:13:56,739 --> 00:13:58,122
What are you trying to do?

198
00:13:58,157 --> 00:14:00,784
I wanna be saved by you and for you.

199
00:14:00,951 --> 00:14:04,996
- You ought to be ashamed of yourself.
- I am, I am an awful sinner.

200
00:14:05,031 --> 00:14:07,748
Coming down here in your fancy clothes.

201
00:14:07,790 --> 00:14:11,334
Why don't you go back where you belong
and stop bothering us?

202
00:14:11,369 --> 00:14:13,461
Bless you, brother.

203
00:14:14,295 --> 00:14:15,970
- Beat it.
- Oh, wait, don't go.

204
00:14:16,005 --> 00:14:18,194
- Let him have it.
- She ain't going. You are.

205
00:14:18,229 --> 00:14:20,307
- Go back where you belong.
- Uptown swell.

206
00:14:20,342 --> 00:14:22,865
- Beat it.
- Now, wait a minute, fellows.

207
00:14:22,900 --> 00:14:25,388
- Now, wait a minute.
- Come on, let's go.

208
00:14:45,113 --> 00:14:47,073
Are you hurt?

209
00:14:48,699 --> 00:14:49,950
I'm numb.

210
00:14:50,117 --> 00:14:52,202
Can you stand up?

211
00:14:53,036 --> 00:14:55,371
I seem to be weak in the knees.

212
00:14:55,538 --> 00:14:57,415
Oh, dear.

213
00:14:57,748 --> 00:15:00,542
Your eyes are dazed and hazy.

214
00:15:00,709 --> 00:15:03,086
- And blue.
- And blu...

215
00:15:03,795 --> 00:15:06,047
There's nothing wrong with you.

216
00:15:07,006 --> 00:15:09,133
Yes, there is, I'm in love.

217
00:15:10,008 --> 00:15:11,343
Love?

218
00:15:11,510 --> 00:15:13,935
You probably don't know about love.

219
00:15:13,970 --> 00:15:17,640
Well, I certainly know it isn't
being numb, weak in the knees.

220
00:15:17,675 --> 00:15:18,891
What is it?

221
00:15:19,058 --> 00:15:24,771
Well, love is an emotion that's alive...

222
00:15:24,937 --> 00:15:27,690
...exciting, vibrant.

223
00:15:29,691 --> 00:15:34,404
You feel like a billowy cloud.

224
00:15:34,904 --> 00:15:37,239
And you walk on air.

225
00:15:40,284 --> 00:15:42,035
And good night.

226
00:15:45,329 --> 00:15:47,790
And you walk on air.

227
00:15:48,290 --> 00:15:50,417
And you walk on air.

228
00:15:51,376 --> 00:15:53,003
And you walk on air.

229
00:16:25,154 --> 00:16:28,240
Seeing's believing

230
00:16:28,365 --> 00:16:31,493
And when I see you

231
00:16:31,660 --> 00:16:37,540
I reali2e what an angel I found

232
00:16:37,873 --> 00:16:41,376
I never thought I would see the day

233
00:16:41,543 --> 00:16:43,753
When miracles occurred

234
00:16:43,920 --> 00:16:47,590
And though the best of authorities

235
00:16:47,756 --> 00:16:50,967
May not believe a word

236
00:16:51,134 --> 00:16:54,345
Kissing's believing

237
00:16:54,470 --> 00:16:57,390
And when I kiss you

238
00:16:57,556 --> 00:17:03,353
I feel as though
We were miles off the ground

239
00:17:04,229 --> 00:17:08,440
Never knew that dreams came true

240
00:17:08,607 --> 00:17:11,651
But miraculously they do

241
00:17:11,777 --> 00:17:19,116
Seeing's believing with you

242
00:17:19,825 --> 00:17:23,411
Seeing's believing

243
00:17:23,578 --> 00:17:26,372
And when I see you

244
00:17:26,539 --> 00:17:32,460
I reali2e what an angel I found

245
00:17:32,627 --> 00:17:36,297
I never thought I would see the day

246
00:17:36,464 --> 00:17:39,133
When miracles occurred

247
00:20:53,795 --> 00:20:56,088
- Dixie, would I lie to you?
- Ring that bell.

248
00:20:56,123 --> 00:20:57,631
There's nobody at home.

249
00:20:57,666 --> 00:20:59,800
I'll find out.

250
00:21:02,886 --> 00:21:05,388
Nobody at home, huh?

251
00:21:05,847 --> 00:21:10,350
- Did you shoot, mum?
- The shooting's just beginning around here.

252
00:21:10,767 --> 00:21:13,436
My nephew is not here, Miss McCoy.

253
00:21:13,603 --> 00:21:16,737
- Oh, you know me then, huh?
- From your picture.

254
00:21:16,772 --> 00:21:19,941
- Last night you were hanging on the wall.
- Mrs. Hill...

255
00:21:19,976 --> 00:21:23,111
Now put that gun away
or you'll be hanging my trophy room.

256
00:21:23,146 --> 00:21:24,362
Come back here.

257
00:21:24,529 --> 00:21:28,324
Well, you'd be upset, too.
if your heart was broken.

258
00:21:29,533 --> 00:21:33,334
Oh, Charles, how could you hurt
and humiliate me so when...

259
00:21:33,369 --> 00:21:38,290
Then expect me to just up and forget it
with a little old big-cash settlement.

260
00:21:38,332 --> 00:21:39,958
Oh, Charles.

261
00:21:40,125 --> 00:21:41,960
This isn't gonna be easy.

262
00:21:43,336 --> 00:21:44,712
That I guarantee.

263
00:21:45,380 --> 00:21:49,383
In which case, I will plaster the name of
Hill in every newspaper in this country.

264
00:21:49,418 --> 00:21:52,886
I'll tell my story from the hippodrome
twice daily.

265
00:21:52,921 --> 00:21:54,095
How much?

266
00:21:54,596 --> 00:21:56,180
Ten thousand dollars.

267
00:21:56,347 --> 00:21:57,723
Blackmail.

268
00:21:59,266 --> 00:22:02,727
Maybe this will teach your nephew
not to toy with my little old heart.

269
00:22:02,762 --> 00:22:05,497
When I get my hands
on that young man...

270
00:22:05,532 --> 00:22:08,232
...I'm gonna toy with
his little old head.

271
00:22:08,607 --> 00:22:11,234
- Female bandit. Here.
- Thank you.

272
00:22:11,401 --> 00:22:13,660
I'll bet this is more
than the others collected.

273
00:22:13,695 --> 00:22:16,322
- I better go and see that she gets a cab.
- You stay!

274
00:22:16,357 --> 00:22:19,279
- Others? What others?
- I'll go and ask her.

275
00:22:19,314 --> 00:22:22,202
One moment, you worm.
I might have known.

276
00:22:22,369 --> 00:22:25,121
All these checks I've written
to Charles, five of them.

277
00:22:25,156 --> 00:22:27,373
Supposedly for his pet charities.

278
00:22:27,456 --> 00:22:30,626
Well, I'm through being charitable
to everyone he pets.

279
00:22:30,661 --> 00:22:33,795
You find him
or I'll never give him another cent.

280
00:22:33,830 --> 00:22:35,880
Not another cent?
Why, you'll ruin me.

281
00:22:35,915 --> 00:22:38,382
Oh, get out. Go on, get out!

282
00:22:38,757 --> 00:22:40,515
And for you, young man...

283
00:22:40,550 --> 00:22:43,428
...you can just wipe that smile
off your face.

284
00:22:43,463 --> 00:22:45,218
Let a little love come in

285
00:22:45,253 --> 00:22:46,973
Oh, let a little love

286
00:22:47,139 --> 00:22:48,314
Let a little love

287
00:22:48,349 --> 00:22:50,184
Let a little love come in

288
00:22:54,229 --> 00:22:56,022
Bless you, brother.

289
00:22:56,606 --> 00:22:59,358
Say, aren't you...? Say, wait a minute.

290
00:23:12,661 --> 00:23:14,704
Hello, beautiful.

291
00:23:15,079 --> 00:23:16,831
Oh, I'm sorry.

292
00:23:17,123 --> 00:23:18,874
He's sorry.

293
00:23:19,041 --> 00:23:21,710
- What can I do for you?
- I'm looking for Miss Bonfils.

294
00:23:21,745 --> 00:23:23,593
- She's upstairs.
- Thank you.

295
00:23:23,628 --> 00:23:25,803
Wait a minute, aren't you the fella...?

296
00:23:25,838 --> 00:23:28,465
And you, you're the young lady
who was singing.

297
00:23:28,507 --> 00:23:31,051
- Yes.
- Divine.

298
00:23:31,218 --> 00:23:33,178
Divine?

299
00:23:38,641 --> 00:23:39,850
Come in.

300
00:23:44,646 --> 00:23:47,648
- Good morning, Miss Bonfils.
- Good morning.

301
00:23:53,445 --> 00:23:55,947
What on earth are you doing up there?

302
00:23:55,982 --> 00:23:58,449
I can't help it. You affect me this way.

303
00:23:58,866 --> 00:24:01,076
- Me?
- You know, what you said.

304
00:24:01,243 --> 00:24:03,286
This is it, I'm in love.

305
00:24:04,954 --> 00:24:06,831
Oh, but that's ridiculous.

306
00:24:06,956 --> 00:24:09,208
You're only supposed to feel that way.

307
00:24:09,243 --> 00:24:11,293
You don't actually...

308
00:24:11,501 --> 00:24:14,045
When I go, I go all the way.

309
00:24:15,004 --> 00:24:18,882
Well, if there's one thing I despise.
it's a showoff.

310
00:24:22,052 --> 00:24:23,803
Well, what did you want?

311
00:24:24,929 --> 00:24:26,681
I want to reform.

312
00:24:26,847 --> 00:24:28,766
Turn over a new leaf.

313
00:24:28,932 --> 00:24:31,852
- I doubt whether I can help.
- Oh, but you can.

314
00:24:31,887 --> 00:24:34,395
You've influenced my life already.

315
00:24:35,021 --> 00:24:37,690
Why, do you know
what I did this morning?

316
00:24:37,725 --> 00:24:40,022
Don't tell me you went to church.

317
00:24:40,057 --> 00:24:42,319
Oh, no, I stayed away from one.

318
00:24:42,777 --> 00:24:46,530
Well, it's certainly not my intention
to influence people in that manner.

319
00:24:46,565 --> 00:24:48,741
I'll explain the whole thing...

320
00:24:48,907 --> 00:24:52,077
...when we get to know each other better.

321
00:24:52,244 --> 00:24:56,622
And I have no intention
of influencing you like that, either.

322
00:24:58,332 --> 00:24:59,666
Yes, Elsie?

323
00:25:00,375 --> 00:25:03,420
- Angela... Oh, hello.
- Hello.

324
00:25:03,586 --> 00:25:06,047
Oh, Angela, I finished the posters.

325
00:25:06,214 --> 00:25:08,716
Oh, and here's the list, Elsie.

326
00:25:10,884 --> 00:25:12,469
Well...

327
00:25:19,266 --> 00:25:20,976
Now, I have work to do.

328
00:25:21,143 --> 00:25:24,395
And I'll appreciate it
if you will kindly leave the premises.

329
00:25:24,430 --> 00:25:25,730
But I belong here.

330
00:25:25,897 --> 00:25:28,607
I'm one of your stray lambs.
A little lost sheep.

331
00:25:28,642 --> 00:25:30,942
"Little lost sheep. "

332
00:25:32,068 --> 00:25:34,195
Oh, please. You can't turn me away.

333
00:25:34,230 --> 00:25:36,110
Why, everyone deserves a chance.

334
00:25:36,145 --> 00:25:38,068
How do you know I'm not sincere?

335
00:25:38,103 --> 00:25:39,957
People can be wrong sometimes.

336
00:25:39,992 --> 00:25:42,417
You mustn't be biased or prejudiced.
Miss Bonfils.

337
00:25:42,452 --> 00:25:45,246
Just because a man is more "uptrodden"
than downtrodden...

338
00:25:45,281 --> 00:25:47,213
...is no reason to suspect his motives.

339
00:25:47,248 --> 00:25:50,354
Frankly, it's the uptrodden
who need the saving these days.

340
00:25:50,389 --> 00:25:53,461
- You've got a point there.
- Then you'll give me a chance?

341
00:25:53,496 --> 00:25:55,296
You'll never regret it.

342
00:25:56,088 --> 00:25:58,465
- I wonder.
- Oh, come on.

343
00:25:58,632 --> 00:26:00,634
Where do we start?

344
00:26:00,801 --> 00:26:02,927
Who will I save first?

345
00:26:03,094 --> 00:26:05,430
- You.
- Me?

346
00:26:07,431 --> 00:26:11,726
Couldn't we start with something easier
and work down to me?

347
00:26:11,810 --> 00:26:14,229
Here's the address
of an employment agency.

348
00:26:14,264 --> 00:26:15,813
What for?

349
00:26:16,147 --> 00:26:18,197
If you really want to join our group...

350
00:26:18,232 --> 00:26:22,235
...let's first see
if you can do an honest day's work.

351
00:26:27,531 --> 00:26:30,325
Well, one day can't be so bad.

352
00:26:31,785 --> 00:26:36,622
All right, I'll do it for you because...

353
00:26:36,789 --> 00:26:40,500
To say I'm fond of you
Would merely be an attitude

354
00:26:40,667 --> 00:26:44,754
To say you're wonderful
Would be a platitude

355
00:26:44,921 --> 00:26:49,383
And so to Santa Claus
I owe eternal gratitude

356
00:26:49,550 --> 00:26:55,054
for leaving you
Beneath my Christmas tree

357
00:26:57,556 --> 00:27:01,226
Baby doll

358
00:27:01,351 --> 00:27:05,980
You beautiful baby doll

359
00:27:06,147 --> 00:27:09,733
Let's go home and tell your mother

360
00:27:10,400 --> 00:27:13,945
That you found a baby brother

361
00:27:14,112 --> 00:27:17,448
I'm takin' you off the shelf

362
00:27:18,157 --> 00:27:21,910
And showin' you off myself

363
00:27:22,577 --> 00:27:24,704
Oh, can't you see it now?

364
00:27:24,871 --> 00:27:27,331
I'm tahing you walhing

365
00:27:27,498 --> 00:27:30,459
Holding your parasol

366
00:27:30,626 --> 00:27:34,462
Oh, honey, there's no use talhing

367
00:27:34,587 --> 00:27:39,258
You're a beautiful baby doll

368
00:27:39,425 --> 00:27:42,802
Baby doll

369
00:27:42,969 --> 00:27:46,931
You beautiful baby doll

370
00:30:01,418 --> 00:30:03,253
Let a little love
Let a little love

371
00:30:03,288 --> 00:30:05,088
Let a little love come in

372
00:30:05,463 --> 00:30:08,090
Let a little love
Let a little love

373
00:30:12,344 --> 00:30:14,095
Watch it.

374
00:30:32,068 --> 00:30:33,653
Look out!

375
00:31:16,814 --> 00:31:18,774
Angela.

376
00:32:00,475 --> 00:32:02,561
Streetcar, miss?

377
00:32:04,479 --> 00:32:05,688
Oh, it's you.

378
00:32:05,855 --> 00:32:09,149
The New York Transit offers
speed, comfort and economy.

379
00:32:09,184 --> 00:32:10,359
No, thank you.

380
00:32:10,525 --> 00:32:13,695
And you better tend to your business
or you'll lose this job too.

381
00:32:13,730 --> 00:32:15,661
I will if I don't get any customers.

382
00:32:15,696 --> 00:32:20,242
I don't mind so much about myself, but
I'd hate to see old Jiggs here lose his job.

383
00:32:20,277 --> 00:32:22,250
He can't afford it at a time like this.

384
00:32:22,285 --> 00:32:24,662
- You see, he's planning to get married.
- Yes?

385
00:32:24,697 --> 00:32:27,004
Yeah, they've already picked out
the stable.

386
00:32:27,039 --> 00:32:30,792
And I'm giving them one of my shoes
to hang over their door for luck.

387
00:32:30,827 --> 00:32:32,676
I'll hope they'll be very happy.

388
00:32:32,711 --> 00:32:35,213
How can they be happy
if we haven't any customers?

389
00:32:35,248 --> 00:32:36,679
What do you say, customer?

390
00:32:36,714 --> 00:32:39,550
- Well, I really shouldn't, but I...
- Oh, you'll like it.

391
00:32:39,585 --> 00:32:40,974
You're gonna love this trip.

392
00:32:41,009 --> 00:32:45,013
Up the Bowery, across Cherry into Grand.
down Rivington through Mulberry.

393
00:32:45,048 --> 00:32:49,516
I've made it eight times today
and I'm still not tired of it.

394
00:32:50,809 --> 00:32:52,686
Hello there.

395
00:32:53,311 --> 00:32:56,355
Everybody's so friendly.
They keep waving at me all day.

396
00:32:56,390 --> 00:32:59,274
- They wanted to get on.
- I know.

397
00:33:21,043 --> 00:33:22,836
Oh, here. Peanuts.

398
00:33:23,003 --> 00:33:24,677
I only wish they were diamonds.

399
00:33:24,712 --> 00:33:28,507
- That's silly, you can't eat diamonds.
- But diamonds can buy a lot of peanuts.

400
00:33:28,542 --> 00:33:30,550
I've got a lot of peanuts.

401
00:33:31,009 --> 00:33:34,345
You know. Jiggs here has been suggesting
a double wedding.

402
00:33:34,380 --> 00:33:37,646
He wants to give us one of his shoes
to hang over our door.

403
00:33:37,681 --> 00:33:42,394
- I think that's very presumptuous.
- You can't argue with a horse.

404
00:33:42,811 --> 00:33:46,522
- Honestly, you're insane.
- Insane?

405
00:33:47,273 --> 00:33:51,777
I should say I am.
From the moment I saw you.

406
00:33:51,985 --> 00:33:54,445
Oops, my heart went oops

407
00:33:54,612 --> 00:33:56,197
The moment that we met

408
00:33:56,239 --> 00:33:57,740
My heart went whoops

409
00:33:57,907 --> 00:33:59,366
I never will forget

410
00:33:59,533 --> 00:34:01,284
My heart turned hoops

411
00:34:01,451 --> 00:34:04,287
The moment that I met you

412
00:34:05,746 --> 00:34:07,998
Oops, my feet went oops

413
00:34:08,165 --> 00:34:09,708
I nearly tooh a spill

414
00:34:09,750 --> 00:34:11,293
My hnees went oops

415
00:34:11,460 --> 00:34:13,086
They shook a bit until

416
00:34:13,169 --> 00:34:14,671
My head went oops

417
00:34:14,837 --> 00:34:17,882
You mustn't let it get you

418
00:34:18,591 --> 00:34:20,259
I was going for a very

419
00:34:20,425 --> 00:34:24,429
What you'd call a
solitary sort of stroll

420
00:34:25,263 --> 00:34:27,139
Just a-twiddling my thumbs

421
00:34:27,181 --> 00:34:30,309
When I heard a lot of drums
Begin to pound

422
00:34:30,434 --> 00:34:33,311
And roll
And oops

423
00:34:33,478 --> 00:34:34,979
My heart went oops

424
00:34:35,146 --> 00:34:36,647
It went into a spin

425
00:34:36,814 --> 00:34:38,357
Of loop-the-loops

426
00:34:38,524 --> 00:34:40,275
You must have thought me kin

427
00:34:40,310 --> 00:34:41,610
To nincompoops

428
00:34:41,777 --> 00:34:44,988
The silly way I acted

429
00:34:45,154 --> 00:34:46,989
Of course, you couldn't hnow

430
00:34:47,024 --> 00:34:48,616
That you were so aglow

431
00:34:48,782 --> 00:34:52,118
And I was so attracted

432
00:34:52,577 --> 00:34:55,455
But, baby, take a bow

433
00:34:55,580 --> 00:34:59,124
My heart is going oops right now

434
00:34:59,291 --> 00:35:00,500
Woo!

435
00:38:49,942 --> 00:38:52,527
I'll be right back.
I'll just be a minute.

436
00:38:52,562 --> 00:38:54,619
I have to put old Jiggs to bed.

437
00:38:54,654 --> 00:38:57,239
And then we can...
We'll go and have a bite of supper.

438
00:38:57,274 --> 00:38:58,866
I know just the place.

439
00:38:58,907 --> 00:39:02,869
Good music and good food.
What do you say?

440
00:39:04,037 --> 00:39:05,705
Angela?

441
00:39:06,414 --> 00:39:08,082
Angela.

442
00:39:09,958 --> 00:39:14,337
- Where are you?
- I'm up here.

443
00:39:18,215 --> 00:39:21,468
You too? Darling.

444
00:39:29,892 --> 00:39:32,526
I might have known
I couldn't trust a nitwit like you.

445
00:39:32,561 --> 00:39:36,001
- I've been all over town, I couldn't find him.
- That settles it.

446
00:39:36,036 --> 00:39:39,441
From now on, as far as I'm concerned.
he's a complete stranger.

447
00:39:39,476 --> 00:39:41,568
- Hello, stranger.
- Hello, Charles.

448
00:39:41,603 --> 00:39:43,111
Charles!

449
00:39:43,278 --> 00:39:46,072
- Charles!
- Where have you been?

450
00:39:46,781 --> 00:39:49,616
- On a streetcar, mostly.
- Streetcar?

451
00:39:49,741 --> 00:39:52,535
- Finally run out of money.
- No, I was driving it.

452
00:39:52,570 --> 00:39:55,413
- Drinking?
- No, Aunt Letty, I was working.

453
00:39:55,448 --> 00:39:57,081
- Working?
- Working?

454
00:39:57,248 --> 00:40:00,667
Did you say you were
driving a streetcar?

455
00:40:00,834 --> 00:40:04,504
And did you maybe ride a bicycle?

456
00:40:04,671 --> 00:40:07,298
And were you pushing one of those...?

457
00:40:08,507 --> 00:40:11,058
Oh, what a relief.
I thought for a moment, I was:

458
00:40:11,093 --> 00:40:14,352
Well, aren't you? Now, sit down.
Tell me what this is all about.

459
00:40:14,387 --> 00:40:18,682
Well, Aunt Letty, I've reformed. And
I want you to meet the girl who did it.

460
00:40:18,717 --> 00:40:19,815
- Girl?
- Girl?

461
00:40:19,850 --> 00:40:21,351
- She's here.
- In this house?

462
00:40:21,386 --> 00:40:22,484
Oh, no.

463
00:40:22,519 --> 00:40:24,979
- This time I'm serious.
- This time I'm serious.

464
00:40:25,014 --> 00:40:26,946
The last mess I'm getting you out off.

465
00:40:26,981 --> 00:40:28,948
- Now, look here...
- Bring in this female.

466
00:40:28,983 --> 00:40:31,777
- This girl doesn't want my money.
- No, none of them do.

467
00:40:31,812 --> 00:40:33,910
Unfortunately, it's always my money.

468
00:40:33,945 --> 00:40:38,199
- Oh, here she is.
- Young woman, if you think you...

469
00:40:40,075 --> 00:40:41,701
You?

470
00:40:42,827 --> 00:40:44,579
You.

471
00:40:44,746 --> 00:40:47,665
You mean, you...

472
00:40:47,832 --> 00:40:49,500
...and he?

473
00:40:49,666 --> 00:40:51,460
Isn't it wonderful?

474
00:40:51,626 --> 00:40:53,711
It's fantastic!

475
00:40:53,878 --> 00:40:56,714
Angela, how did a sweet.
lovely child like you...

476
00:40:56,749 --> 00:40:59,014
...ever meet a man like my nephew?

477
00:40:59,049 --> 00:41:02,823
- I guess it was fate.
- But how did you meet?

478
00:41:02,858 --> 00:41:06,597
Did he go where you go
or did you go where...?

479
00:41:06,764 --> 00:41:09,683
- Oh, no.
- I hope you'll approve of me.

480
00:41:09,850 --> 00:41:12,686
Angela, I can understand
your being attracted to Charles.

481
00:41:12,721 --> 00:41:15,188
His personality and charm.

482
00:41:15,313 --> 00:41:20,234
But it's only fair to warn you, honey.
You see, Charles has one trait...

483
00:41:20,269 --> 00:41:23,570
...a characteristic inherited
from his uncle's side of the family.

484
00:41:23,605 --> 00:41:24,702
What's that?

485
00:41:24,737 --> 00:41:26,739
- He's no good.
- What?

486
00:41:26,906 --> 00:41:29,283
I'm sure Charles would be
the first to admit it.

487
00:41:29,318 --> 00:41:31,416
I wouldn't.
I must have some good in me...

488
00:41:31,451 --> 00:41:33,953
...even if it comes from
your side of the family.

489
00:41:33,988 --> 00:41:35,830
Of course he has.

490
00:41:35,997 --> 00:41:40,375
Goodness knows Charles needs help and
he couldn't find a better little helper.

491
00:41:40,410 --> 00:41:41,967
Then you'll give your consent?

492
00:41:42,002 --> 00:41:45,171
I'll take care of everything.
The wedding, your bridal gown...

493
00:41:45,206 --> 00:41:47,774
...and from now on.
my home will be your home.

494
00:41:47,809 --> 00:41:50,342
That's the one thing I've missed
all these years.

495
00:41:50,377 --> 00:41:53,553
A family.
But now I'll have the two of you.

496
00:41:54,095 --> 00:41:56,681
And pretty soon, there may be three.

497
00:41:56,889 --> 00:42:00,517
Well, I have to live someplace.

498
00:42:07,023 --> 00:42:09,337
Perhaps you'd be interested in our park.

499
00:42:09,372 --> 00:42:11,742
Most young engaged couples like summer.

500
00:42:11,777 --> 00:42:14,008
Oh, I've never liked
summer, It's too hot.

501
00:42:14,043 --> 00:42:16,239
- Oh, summer's too hot.
- Summer's too hot.

502
00:42:16,274 --> 00:42:19,116
- Well, what about winter?
- Winter?

503
00:42:19,491 --> 00:42:20,826
Too cold.

504
00:42:20,993 --> 00:42:22,827
- Too cold.
- Yes, winter's too cold.

505
00:42:22,862 --> 00:42:25,246
How about something in between?

506
00:42:25,413 --> 00:42:27,915
- I've always liked autumn.
- Autumn.

507
00:42:27,950 --> 00:42:30,125
- Autumn.
- Autumn.

508
00:42:30,292 --> 00:42:32,842
- Now, isn't that just lovely?
- Oh, yes.

509
00:42:32,877 --> 00:42:36,464
- You sit right here.
- Don't you like that? I've always liked fall.

510
00:42:36,499 --> 00:42:39,299
- Right here, there we are.
- And look at these.

511
00:42:39,334 --> 00:42:42,093
- Like this?
- Now, right here like this?

512
00:42:43,386 --> 00:42:46,013
- Beautiful, beautiful.
- Lovely, lovely.

513
00:42:46,055 --> 00:42:51,184
If you'll hold it, please.
What a lovely couple.

514
00:42:52,978 --> 00:42:58,023
We're posing for a picture

515
00:42:58,149 --> 00:43:02,194
By Currier and Ives

516
00:43:02,360 --> 00:43:05,988
And I can't wait

517
00:43:06,155 --> 00:43:10,951
Till the great day arrives

518
00:43:11,118 --> 00:43:14,912
For you'll be so attractive

519
00:43:15,079 --> 00:43:19,041
And I'll be so in love

520
00:43:19,208 --> 00:43:27,089
That years from now when I'm madame

521
00:43:27,256 --> 00:43:31,259
And everybody calls you sir

522
00:43:31,385 --> 00:43:35,555
We still can see

523
00:43:35,680 --> 00:43:42,269
The boy and girl we were

524
00:43:43,186 --> 00:43:48,649
For grooms turn into husbands

525
00:43:48,816 --> 00:43:53,236
And brides turn into wives

526
00:43:53,403 --> 00:43:57,198
And there we'll be

527
00:43:57,365 --> 00:44:03,203
For the rest of our lives

528
00:44:04,454 --> 00:44:09,208
So thank you, Mr. Currier

529
00:44:10,250 --> 00:44:18,924
And thank you, Mr, Ives

530
00:50:32,652 --> 00:50:33,785
Over here?

531
00:50:33,820 --> 00:50:36,176
- Get out of the way, will you?
- Miss Elsie.

532
00:50:36,211 --> 00:50:38,532
- Oh, good morning, boys.
- Miss Elsie, look.

533
00:50:38,567 --> 00:50:41,326
Look what we've got for the newlyweds.

534
00:50:41,493 --> 00:50:43,620
- Oh, that's beautiful.
- Yeah.

535
00:50:43,787 --> 00:50:45,753
- Where'd you get it?
- Where'd we get it?

536
00:50:45,788 --> 00:50:48,415
- Why, we bought it.
- Where do you think? We bought it.

537
00:50:48,450 --> 00:50:51,335
- Good morning, Miss Elsie.
- Good morning.

538
00:50:51,626 --> 00:50:55,588
- It's beautiful, it's beautiful.
- Thank you. We're gonna rehearse now.

539
00:50:55,623 --> 00:50:58,299
- Fine.
- Gilfred, we're gonna rehearse.

540
00:51:02,886 --> 00:51:06,222
Gilfred, that's much too slow.
Now, again.

541
00:51:08,641 --> 00:51:10,976
Gilfred, your heart isn't in it.

542
00:51:11,059 --> 00:51:13,311
Well, how could it be?

543
00:51:14,187 --> 00:51:18,440
Now, they're gonna be walking like this.
Now, you watch me.

544
00:51:22,611 --> 00:51:24,619
Come on. Officer Clancy.
you be the groom.

545
00:51:24,654 --> 00:51:27,406
- Oh, Miss Elsie, I'll feel silly.
- No, you won't.

546
00:51:27,441 --> 00:51:29,283
- Come on.
- Oh, all right.

547
00:51:54,637 --> 00:51:56,389
I do.

548
00:52:00,184 --> 00:52:03,353
Remember, now, you boys line up here
and kiss the bride.

549
00:52:03,388 --> 00:52:05,229
First the groom.

550
00:52:10,442 --> 00:52:11,943
Angela.

551
00:52:12,110 --> 00:52:15,154
- Hello, Gilfred.
- Angela, you look lovely.

552
00:52:15,321 --> 00:52:17,406
Well, thank you.

553
00:52:17,531 --> 00:52:19,533
You're very sweet.

554
00:52:19,700 --> 00:52:22,702
Well, apparently not sweet enough.

555
00:52:24,078 --> 00:52:25,211
Gilfred, you mustn't...

556
00:52:25,246 --> 00:52:29,124
Perhaps it will be best if someone else
played the "Wedding March. "

557
00:52:29,159 --> 00:52:32,085
- But you play so beautifully.
- Please.

558
00:52:32,252 --> 00:52:34,587
I'm not made of wood.

559
00:52:36,339 --> 00:52:37,930
- All right.
- Oh, Angela.

560
00:52:37,965 --> 00:52:43,803
If you should change your mind.
you'll find me a very forgiving man.

561
00:52:53,728 --> 00:52:55,875
- You sure you don't want one?
- No, thanks.

562
00:52:55,910 --> 00:52:58,023
- Well, I thought maybe...
- No, thank you.

563
00:52:58,058 --> 00:53:00,442
All right, all right.

564
00:53:03,486 --> 00:53:05,405
- A game of cribbage?
- Not for me.

565
00:53:05,440 --> 00:53:06,614
Oh, sure.

566
00:53:06,781 --> 00:53:09,575
It might be a good idea
to lay off those cards.

567
00:53:09,610 --> 00:53:12,369
You know.
the gambling fool is the devil's tool.

568
00:53:12,404 --> 00:53:14,204
Thank you.

569
00:53:14,370 --> 00:53:17,456
Look, I know that this wedding tomorrow
is important to you.

570
00:53:17,491 --> 00:53:19,298
I know you wanna take it easy.

571
00:53:19,333 --> 00:53:23,086
But this is your last night.
You can't just sit here and read.

572
00:53:23,121 --> 00:53:25,463
No, as a matter of fact.
I think I'll turn in.

573
00:53:25,498 --> 00:53:27,381
Turn in? It's 9:OO.

574
00:53:27,548 --> 00:53:30,821
Don't you know that every hour of sleep
you get before midnight...

575
00:53:30,856 --> 00:53:34,095
...does you more good
than all the hours you sleep after that?

576
00:53:34,130 --> 00:53:36,437
- No, I do not.
- Well, you should.

577
00:53:36,472 --> 00:53:38,703
Just fine.
your wanting to turn a new leaf...

578
00:53:38,738 --> 00:53:40,899
...but you can't be
this good all at once.

579
00:53:40,934 --> 00:53:44,145
It's too much of a shock
to your nervous system. And mine.

580
00:53:44,180 --> 00:53:46,189
See you in the morning, Max.

581
00:53:46,689 --> 00:53:48,531
Now, who could that be at this hour?

582
00:53:48,566 --> 00:53:51,151
Probably a little man.
a white coat with a net.

583
00:53:51,186 --> 00:53:53,945
- Better say I've retired.
- Hey.

584
00:53:56,072 --> 00:53:58,157
It's a policeman.

585
00:53:58,324 --> 00:54:00,117
A policeman?

586
00:54:04,912 --> 00:54:06,956
- It's you. Officer Clancy.
- Good evening.

587
00:54:06,991 --> 00:54:08,308
- Mr. Ferris.
- How do you do?

588
00:54:08,343 --> 00:54:09,590
- Good evening.
- Sit down.

589
00:54:09,625 --> 00:54:13,545
Thank you, I wanted to say that on behalf
of me and the boys in the precinct...

590
00:54:13,580 --> 00:54:15,380
That's Precinct 99.

591
00:54:15,546 --> 00:54:19,008
We.., I wanna congratulate you
on the coming nuptials.

592
00:54:19,043 --> 00:54:20,724
Oh, thank you, thank you.

593
00:54:20,759 --> 00:54:23,476
At first, a lot of the boys thought
you were no good.

594
00:54:23,511 --> 00:54:26,389
- But I convinced them otherwise.
- That's very kind of you.

595
00:54:26,424 --> 00:54:28,439
They don't come any
better than Mr. Hill.

596
00:54:28,474 --> 00:54:30,830
- Please.
- Well, how about a toast to the bride.

597
00:54:30,865 --> 00:54:33,186
- No, I don't think we'd better.
- Oh, I'm off duty.

598
00:54:33,221 --> 00:54:34,646
No, I mean me.

599
00:54:35,438 --> 00:54:37,238
You won't drink to the bride?

600
00:54:37,273 --> 00:54:39,198
- Well, really, I...
- To Angela?

601
00:54:39,233 --> 00:54:42,444
And you won't drink to her?
Well, I'll see that something's done...

602
00:54:42,479 --> 00:54:45,029
Now, wait a minute.
You're right, absolutely right.

603
00:54:45,064 --> 00:54:46,572
Well, I was wondering.

604
00:54:46,656 --> 00:54:48,991
I didn't mean
that I wouldn't drink to her.

605
00:54:49,026 --> 00:54:51,326
- Don't get me wrong.
- A little bit of ice.

606
00:54:51,361 --> 00:54:53,585
A very short one. A wonderful girl.

607
00:54:53,620 --> 00:54:55,621
- Mr. Hill live here?
- Oh, come right in.

608
00:54:55,656 --> 00:54:57,081
Thank you very much.

609
00:54:57,248 --> 00:54:59,625
All right. Good evening, Mr. Hill.

610
00:55:01,001 --> 00:55:02,961
- Well, hello there.
- How are you?

611
00:55:02,996 --> 00:55:04,834
- You know Mr. Ferris?
- How do you do?

612
00:55:04,869 --> 00:55:06,672
- You boys know each other?
- Yeah.

613
00:55:06,707 --> 00:55:08,055
- Sit down.
- No, thanks.

614
00:55:08,090 --> 00:55:10,551
I just came to congratulate you
on your coming...

615
00:55:10,586 --> 00:55:12,184
- Nuptials.
- Thank you very much.

616
00:55:12,219 --> 00:55:14,644
- Thanks a lot. Thank you.
- I ain't much on words.

617
00:55:14,679 --> 00:55:17,681
- Why don't we just toast the bride?
- No, I don't think I will.

618
00:55:17,716 --> 00:55:20,017
- Ain't gonna toast the bride?
- Well, really, I...

619
00:55:20,052 --> 00:55:21,274
You love her, don't you?

620
00:55:21,309 --> 00:55:24,485
- Let's toast the bride.
- Good idea, good idea.

621
00:55:24,520 --> 00:55:27,106
- Would you like a little soda?
- No, straight, please.

622
00:55:27,141 --> 00:55:29,500
- I'll have a double this time.
- A double.

623
00:55:29,535 --> 00:55:31,860
- How old is this whiskey?
- It's probably 40.

624
00:55:31,895 --> 00:55:33,695
- Mr. Hill's apartment?
- Oh, yes.

625
00:55:33,730 --> 00:55:35,234
- Come right in.
- To Angela.

626
00:55:35,269 --> 00:55:36,704
- To Angela.
- To Angela.

627
00:55:36,739 --> 00:55:40,284
- The sweetest girl in the whole world.
- You bet.

628
00:55:40,450 --> 00:55:42,764
- Good evening, Mr. Hill.
- Why, hello there.

629
00:55:42,799 --> 00:55:45,044
Mr. Hill
I came here to congiatulate you...

630
00:55:45,079 --> 00:55:47,581
...and to tell you
that in spite of our rivalry...

631
00:55:47,616 --> 00:55:50,083
...I've consented to play
the "Wedding March. "

632
00:55:50,118 --> 00:55:52,002
- Oh, I'm honored.
- Please.

633
00:55:52,127 --> 00:55:55,338
- You're quite welcome.
- Gilfred, ain't you gonna toast the bride?

634
00:55:55,380 --> 00:55:59,299
- Well, I usually don't indulge.
- Come on, pour him a drink.

635
00:55:59,334 --> 00:56:02,010
- How would you like yours?
- I'll take mine straight.

636
00:56:02,045 --> 00:56:04,762
- Just straight.
- A tall one this time.

637
00:56:04,929 --> 00:56:07,556
- There you are.
- Fill mine to the top.

638
00:56:07,591 --> 00:56:10,149
- Here we go. To the bride.
- To the bride.

639
00:56:10,184 --> 00:56:13,436
- No question about it, sir.
- You can have it with us.

640
00:56:13,471 --> 00:56:15,772
I always say.., I always say...

641
00:56:16,355 --> 00:56:21,651
- Howdy, Mr. Hill.
- Congratulations, Mr. Hill. Congratulations.

642
00:56:30,242 --> 00:56:32,953
Charlie, wake up.

643
00:56:33,119 --> 00:56:35,455
- Wake up.
- I am awake.

644
00:56:35,621 --> 00:56:37,039
Wide awake.

645
00:56:37,206 --> 00:56:42,752
- Max, how'd we get here?
- You insisted on a last toast with Jiggs.

646
00:56:43,336 --> 00:56:47,256
Quite a celebration for something
that didn't come off.

647
00:56:47,882 --> 00:56:49,800
What time is it?

648
00:56:50,676 --> 00:56:52,219
One-thirty.

649
00:56:52,385 --> 00:56:54,762
The wedding was at noon.

650
00:56:55,221 --> 00:56:56,389
Yeah.

651
00:56:56,514 --> 00:56:59,683
What are we doing here?
Let's get this thing straightened out.

652
00:56:59,718 --> 00:57:01,601
It is straightened out.

653
00:57:02,269 --> 00:57:06,439
Max, I love Angela more than anything
in this world.

654
00:57:06,606 --> 00:57:08,155
But look what I've done to her.

655
00:57:08,190 --> 00:57:10,901
Look what happens
when my intentions are good.

656
00:57:10,936 --> 00:57:13,069
But this wasn't even your fault.

657
00:57:13,104 --> 00:57:14,654
Sure it was.

658
00:57:15,279 --> 00:57:16,864
We gotta do something.

659
00:57:17,031 --> 00:57:20,117
We can at least convince her
you're not a heel.

660
00:57:20,152 --> 00:57:22,452
You couldn't even convince me.

661
00:57:35,421 --> 00:57:36,964
Angela.

662
00:57:39,675 --> 00:57:42,260
The janitor let me in.

663
00:57:43,428 --> 00:57:45,680
He called me Mrs. Hill.

664
00:57:47,014 --> 00:57:50,684
He probably thought we were...

665
00:57:53,561 --> 00:57:55,229
You look so lovely.

666
00:57:56,522 --> 00:57:58,691
I'd have made a lovely bride.

667
00:58:01,234 --> 00:58:05,530
Must have been embarrassing.

668
00:58:05,696 --> 00:58:08,699
Yes, it was.

669
00:58:08,866 --> 00:58:10,492
Sure.

670
00:58:10,659 --> 00:58:12,327
Charles.

671
00:58:13,453 --> 00:58:15,246
It's not too late.

672
00:58:17,415 --> 00:58:20,250
It's no use, Angela, It won't work.

673
00:58:20,417 --> 00:58:22,217
Can't you see what I've done?

674
00:58:22,252 --> 00:58:26,130
- I'm unreliable and selfish.
- You were all of those things this morning.

675
00:58:26,165 --> 00:58:28,340
Exactly, but I just realized it.

676
00:58:28,375 --> 00:58:29,883
That's nonsense.

677
00:58:30,050 --> 00:58:34,887
This is my wedding day
and I want to get married.

678
00:58:35,638 --> 00:58:40,058
But you don't marry a fellow just
because you happen to be dressed for it.

679
00:58:40,093 --> 00:58:41,983
Darling, you need someone dependable.

680
00:58:42,018 --> 00:58:45,688
- A man with both feet on the ground.
- No, Charles.

681
00:58:45,855 --> 00:58:50,192
I want a man who walks on air.

682
00:58:53,028 --> 00:58:54,445
Please marry me.

683
00:59:09,541 --> 00:59:11,084
Angela.

684
00:59:27,223 --> 00:59:31,935
Angela? You know.
I think you play beautifully.

685
00:59:33,770 --> 00:59:35,355
Thank you.

686
00:59:37,857 --> 00:59:43,486
You know, I don't think there's anything
prettier than a drum and a tambourine.

687
00:59:43,737 --> 00:59:45,822
Don't you agree?

688
01:00:00,500 --> 01:00:02,752
Elsie, where's Angela?

689
01:00:02,919 --> 01:00:06,172
- She's not with us anymore.
- She hasn't left the group?

690
01:00:06,207 --> 01:00:09,425
Oh, yes. We cried the night
she turned in her tambourine.

691
01:00:09,466 --> 01:00:12,302
- Oh, she's changed so.
- Changed?

692
01:00:12,427 --> 01:00:18,015
Yes, she said something about
being so tired of being too good.

693
01:00:18,182 --> 01:00:20,267
She was awful good, you know.

694
01:00:20,350 --> 01:00:22,561
Haven't you any idea where
I could find her?

695
01:00:22,596 --> 01:00:25,063
Well, let me see.

696
01:00:25,229 --> 01:00:27,023
You might try...

697
01:00:27,231 --> 01:00:30,067
You might try the gayer places.

698
01:00:30,234 --> 01:00:31,568
Cabarets.

699
01:00:31,735 --> 01:00:35,196
Elsie, if you have any word from her
at all, call me at Webber's Casino.

700
01:00:35,231 --> 01:00:37,031
I'm there every night.

701
01:00:37,198 --> 01:00:38,907
All right.

702
01:00:43,995 --> 01:00:46,170
- Elsie, how could...?
- I had to say something.

703
01:00:46,205 --> 01:00:49,208
- What will he think of me?
- At least he'll be thinking of you.

704
01:00:49,243 --> 01:00:52,377
And I think that tonight
we'll go to Webber's Casino.

705
01:00:52,412 --> 01:00:53,628
- What?
- Yes.

706
01:00:53,795 --> 01:00:57,673
Now, that you're a disillusioned woman
we'll give Charlie a chance to reform you.

707
01:00:57,708 --> 01:01:00,224
How could I act like a frivolous woman?

708
01:01:00,259 --> 01:01:03,178
- You've got every part to play it with.
- It's impossible.

709
01:01:03,213 --> 01:01:05,304
- I could never do like that.
- Yes, you can.

710
01:01:05,339 --> 01:01:07,355
You've been moaning around for months.

711
01:01:07,390 --> 01:01:10,100
- You're going, I don't care what you say.
- I couldn't.

712
01:01:10,135 --> 01:01:12,745
- Oh, Elsie, look at this.
- Oh, it's beautiful.

713
01:01:12,780 --> 01:01:15,256
- I'll get my things together.
- It does feel soft.

714
01:01:15,291 --> 01:01:17,697
Don't take any of my things.
Where's my corset?

715
01:01:17,732 --> 01:01:20,567
- These are your gloves.
- You have it. This is my necklace.

716
01:01:20,602 --> 01:01:23,153
- These are my earrings.
- What was this? I forgot...

717
01:01:23,188 --> 01:01:26,113
- Elsie, Garters.
- Oh, the garters.

718
01:01:26,239 --> 01:01:28,038
But do you think we can be this bad?

719
01:01:28,073 --> 01:01:30,124
You're not being bad.
just little naughty.

720
01:01:30,159 --> 01:01:32,702
- Well, I don't know.
- Now, hurry up and get dressed.

721
01:01:32,737 --> 01:01:35,747
Oh, I can't wait, I can't wait.

722
01:02:40,968 --> 01:02:43,636
Wanna be naughty

723
01:02:44,804 --> 01:02:47,390
Maughty but nice

724
01:02:48,849 --> 01:02:51,268
See if I'm made of

725
01:02:52,811 --> 01:02:55,855
Sugar and spice

726
01:02:56,689 --> 01:02:59,566
To all convention

727
01:02:59,733 --> 01:03:04,195
I call out, "Gangway"

728
01:03:04,362 --> 01:03:08,532
I confess that I wanna care less

729
01:03:09,074 --> 01:03:12,619
Than Eva Tanguay

730
01:03:13,745 --> 01:03:17,039
Gladly I'd chance the

731
01:03:17,748 --> 01:03:21,543
Stares of a few

732
01:03:22,419 --> 01:03:25,838
If I could dance the

733
01:03:26,672 --> 01:03:29,466
Bunny hug too

734
01:03:30,551 --> 01:03:33,345
Suppose a stranger

735
01:03:33,511 --> 01:03:37,473
Should arrange a tte--tte

736
01:03:38,224 --> 01:03:40,767
While he becomes pleasant

737
01:03:40,934 --> 01:03:43,103
Across a hot pheasant

738
01:03:43,269 --> 01:03:48,482
I'll put the whole thing on ice

739
01:03:49,691 --> 01:03:54,028
That's if I'm naughty

740
01:03:54,862 --> 01:03:58,949
Mot really naughty

741
01:04:00,075 --> 01:04:04,913
Just sort of naughty

742
01:04:05,413 --> 01:04:06,998
But nice

743
01:06:20,859 --> 01:06:22,861
Wanna be naughty

Oh, Elsie, you look lovely.

765
01:08:10,798 --> 01:08:12,994
- Are you ready?
- Ready.

766
01:08:26,214 --> 01:08:29,800
Baby doll

767
01:08:29,967 --> 01:08:34,762
You beautiful baby doll

768
01:08:35,179 --> 01:08:36,931
Can't you see it now?

769
01:08:37,098 --> 01:08:39,475
I'm tahing you walhing

770
01:08:39,641 --> 01:08:43,395
Holding your parasol

771
01:08:43,561 --> 01:08:47,606
Oh, honey, there's no use talhing

772
01:08:47,732 --> 01:08:57,281
You're a beautiful baby doll

773
01:09:16,464 --> 01:09:18,340
Good evening, ladies.

774
01:09:50,325 --> 01:09:51,993
- Look.
- What?

775
01:09:52,160 --> 01:09:53,995
He's a waiter.

776
01:09:56,414 --> 01:09:58,666
- He's working.
- Yeah.

777
01:09:58,832 --> 01:10:01,897
- Do you think he's seen us yet?
- I don't know.

778
01:10:01,932 --> 01:10:04,963
He's turning around.
Quick, look sophisticated.

779
01:10:09,842 --> 01:10:11,718
He's turning around again.

780
01:10:11,843 --> 01:10:14,512
He's looking this way.

781
01:10:17,014 --> 01:10:18,807
He's seen us.

782
01:10:21,810 --> 01:10:23,395
Oh, mercy.

783
01:10:24,687 --> 01:10:26,606
Here he comes.

784
01:10:26,939 --> 01:10:29,316
- Angela, Elsie.
- Well.

785
01:10:29,483 --> 01:10:31,443
- Oh, it's you.
- This is terrible.

786
01:10:31,485 --> 01:10:34,425
Well, what's the matter?
Isn't my halo on straight?

787
01:10:34,460 --> 01:10:37,365
Two nice girls like you.
out in a caf unescorted.

788
01:10:37,400 --> 01:10:39,783
Oh, don't worry.

789
01:10:39,950 --> 01:10:41,208
You've got to leave.

790
01:10:41,243 --> 01:10:43,495
Are we going to have to send
for another waiter?

791
01:10:43,530 --> 01:10:45,712
You girls don't belong
in a place like this.

792
01:10:45,747 --> 01:10:49,583
Thank goodness we didn't have trouble
with the waiters in those other places.

793
01:10:49,618 --> 01:10:51,251
What other places?

794
01:10:51,418 --> 01:10:55,046
Well, with all we've had to drink.
it's hard to remember.

795
01:10:55,081 --> 01:10:56,547
What?

796
01:10:58,007 --> 01:11:01,009
Let's order something
before it wears off.

797
01:11:01,051 --> 01:11:03,226
Yes, just take our order, waiter.

798
01:11:03,261 --> 01:11:06,889
- But what'll it be, Elsie?
- The same. Champagne.

799
01:11:07,056 --> 01:11:09,224
- Champagne?
- Champagne.

800
01:11:09,391 --> 01:11:12,060
- Angela.
- And hurry.

801
01:11:15,980 --> 01:11:18,315
It's working. He's worried.

802
01:11:18,482 --> 01:11:21,026
Well, he should be.

803
01:11:22,819 --> 01:11:24,786
Give me a bottle of sparkling soda.

804
01:11:24,821 --> 01:11:27,573
- Sparkling soda.
- Two champagne glasses.

805
01:11:27,615 --> 01:11:29,450
Champagne glasses for soda?

806
01:11:29,491 --> 01:11:32,452
- That's what I said.
- That's a new one.

807
01:11:33,995 --> 01:11:35,413
Thank you.

808
01:11:35,872 --> 01:11:37,998
Champagne.

809
01:11:41,960 --> 01:11:44,045
I hate to see you do this.

810
01:11:44,712 --> 01:11:47,214
Oh, we wanted two bottles.

811
01:11:47,381 --> 01:11:49,508
We only serve one at a time.

812
01:11:49,675 --> 01:11:52,677
Unless you were planning
to drink it out of the bottle.

813
01:11:52,712 --> 01:11:55,555
- Don't be rude, waiter.
- Anything else?

814
01:11:55,722 --> 01:11:57,890
No, that'll be all.

815
01:12:02,185 --> 01:12:04,395
Elsie, I'm frightened.

816
01:12:04,562 --> 01:12:06,063
Why?

817
01:12:06,230 --> 01:12:08,566
- I like it.
- Me too.

818
01:12:08,732 --> 01:12:11,276
But I don't feel anything.

819
01:12:11,443 --> 01:12:15,113
- Neither do I.
- Maybe it hits you all at once.

820
01:12:15,279 --> 01:12:20,951
- Well, I hope I'm sitting down when it does.
- If you're not, you will be.

821
01:12:22,536 --> 01:12:25,705
And now, ladies and gents.
Webber's Casino presents...

822
01:12:25,740 --> 01:12:28,082
...one of our own
famous singing waiters.

823
01:12:28,117 --> 01:12:30,542
Waiter Number 7, Charlie Hill.

824
01:12:56,480 --> 01:13:01,276
I wanna be a dancin' man

825
01:13:01,485 --> 01:13:02,944
While I can

826
01:13:03,653 --> 01:13:09,325
Gonna leave my footsteps
On the sands of time

827
01:13:10,200 --> 01:13:12,994
If I never leave a dime

828
01:13:14,454 --> 01:13:17,331
Never be a millionaire

829
01:13:17,832 --> 01:13:19,750
I don't care

830
01:13:19,917 --> 01:13:25,797
I'll be rich as old King Midas
Might have been

831
01:13:26,547 --> 01:13:29,341
Least until the tide comes in

832
01:13:31,093 --> 01:13:36,013
Let other men build mighty nations

833
01:13:36,639 --> 01:13:39,767
And buildings to the sky

834
01:13:41,226 --> 01:13:44,270
I'll leave a few creations

835
01:13:44,729 --> 01:13:47,148
To show that I was dancing by

836
01:13:47,315 --> 01:13:50,526
I wanna be

837
01:13:50,901 --> 01:13:54,362
free as any bird can be

838
01:13:54,487 --> 01:13:56,405
Yes sirree

839
01:13:56,572 --> 01:14:02,702
Gonna leave my footsteps
On the sands of time

840
01:14:03,286 --> 01:14:06,664
If I never leave a dime

841
01:14:07,456 --> 01:14:09,166
A dancin' man

842
01:14:09,500 --> 01:14:12,836
With footsteps on the sands

843
01:14:13,044 --> 01:14:14,796
Of rhythm

844
01:14:16,547 --> 01:14:19,466
And rhyme

845
01:16:20,734 --> 01:16:22,277
A dancing man

846
01:16:22,569 --> 01:16:25,905
With footsteps on the sands

847
01:16:26,072 --> 01:16:27,740
Of rhythm

848
01:16:46,172 --> 01:16:47,888
- Very good, waiter.
- Thank you.

849
01:16:47,923 --> 01:16:51,134
- Here, would you deliver this note for me?
- Certainly, sir. To...?

850
01:16:51,169 --> 01:16:53,720
That blond number right over there.

851
01:16:56,764 --> 01:17:01,143
But, sir, a note from a stranger
might offend the young lady.

852
01:17:01,268 --> 01:17:04,229
- With her type, there are no strangers.
- That's right.

853
01:17:04,264 --> 01:17:06,772
Go on, hurry, hurry. Go on, go on.

854
01:17:10,526 --> 01:17:13,486
- Oh, Charles, you were just wonderful.
- Marvelous.

855
01:17:13,521 --> 01:17:16,572
- From an admirer.
- Oh, thank you.

856
01:17:24,204 --> 01:17:26,664
Elsie, I think we'd better leave.

857
01:17:26,872 --> 01:17:29,666
Why, this is one
of the most respectable saloo...

858
01:17:29,701 --> 01:17:32,502
- Restaurants in New York.
- Good evening.

859
01:17:34,963 --> 01:17:36,756
- Two, please.
- Sir.

860
01:17:38,716 --> 01:17:41,051
See? There's Charlie.

861
01:17:44,429 --> 01:17:46,764
It's a fight. Come on.

862
01:17:46,931 --> 01:17:48,724
Call the cops.

863
01:17:51,518 --> 01:17:52,811
Look out!

864
01:17:52,978 --> 01:17:55,021
- Watch out!
- Charlie!

865
01:17:58,941 --> 01:18:02,576
- What kind of place is this anyway?
- I didn't know that this sort of thing...

866
01:18:02,611 --> 01:18:08,699
- Where is...? I didn't expect this to happen.
- A fine lawyer you are, I could sue you.

867
01:18:09,033 --> 01:18:13,453
Oh, now, just listen.
I'm an innocent bystander.

868
01:18:14,287 --> 01:18:16,664
- Angela.
- Get out of my way.

869
01:18:16,831 --> 01:18:18,297
- Why, Angela?
- Mrs. Hill.

870
01:18:18,332 --> 01:18:19,923
- What are you doing here?
- Well...

871
01:18:19,958 --> 01:18:23,503
- Look at you. Absolutely disgusting.
- It didn't turn out like we thought.

872
01:18:23,538 --> 01:18:26,380
- Have you been drinking?
- No, Aunt Letty, just soda water.

873
01:18:26,415 --> 01:18:27,722
- Soda water?
- Soda water?

874
01:18:27,757 --> 01:18:31,051
You know very well, Angela.
that I'm not going to serve you any...

875
01:18:31,086 --> 01:18:34,429
- I wanna get out. Let go.
- Mrs. Phineas Hill.

876
01:18:34,596 --> 01:18:38,432
You know, I thought my champagne
tasted flat. Come on.

877
01:18:38,467 --> 01:18:40,475
- Angela.
- Let go of me. Don't touch me.

878
01:18:40,517 --> 01:18:44,395
- For heaven's sake, don't make a scene.
- Scene? Who's making a scene?

879
01:18:44,430 --> 01:18:46,981
- What about the scene you made?
- I was defending you.

880
01:18:47,016 --> 01:18:49,274
- You have no right to defend me.
- I have too.

881
01:18:49,309 --> 01:18:51,902
I love you and you love me.

882
01:18:52,068 --> 01:18:55,154
- I do not.
- Hey, here's your bird.

883
01:18:55,321 --> 01:18:57,281
I don't want it. Throw it away.

884
01:18:57,316 --> 01:18:58,866
Gladly.

885
01:18:59,908 --> 01:19:02,619
I don't wanna see it again.
I don't wanna see you again.

886
01:19:02,654 --> 01:19:03,752
That can be arranged.

887
01:19:03,787 --> 01:19:07,164
- I've never been treated so insufferably.
- You got what you deserved.

888
01:19:07,199 --> 01:19:08,541
- Is that so?
- Yes.

889
01:19:08,666 --> 01:19:12,877
I ordered champagne, I wanted champagne
and I expected to get champagne.

890
01:19:12,912 --> 01:19:14,837
And what did you bring me? Soda water.

891
01:19:14,872 --> 01:19:16,262
Angela, I was only...

892
01:19:16,297 --> 01:19:19,967
- You were only a conceited, egotistical...
- Then why did you wanna marry me?

893
01:19:20,002 --> 01:19:22,802
- Because you need me.
- Need you? Listen to who's talking.

894
01:19:22,837 --> 01:19:25,596
I was modest enough
to think you were too good for me.

895
01:19:25,631 --> 01:19:27,719
I even tried to make you hate me.

896
01:19:27,754 --> 01:19:29,773
Well, you've done a very good job.

897
01:19:29,808 --> 01:19:33,311
You don't know what a relief it is
to suddenly find that I despise you.

898
01:19:33,346 --> 01:19:35,772
I've developed a delightful dislike
for you too.

899
01:19:35,807 --> 01:19:38,857
- I also hate you.
- Ditto for me.

900
01:19:39,024 --> 01:19:41,735
- Why, you...
- Look out!

901
01:19:52,119 --> 01:19:55,204
Come down here.
Come down here this minute.

902
01:19:55,371 --> 01:19:56,998
You can't do that.

903
01:19:57,164 --> 01:19:59,833
Yes, they can. They're in love.

904
01:20:04,837 --> 01:20:10,384
When you're out
With the belle of Mew Yorh

905
01:20:10,551 --> 01:20:13,970
With the beautiful belle of Mew Yorh

906
01:20:14,137 --> 01:20:17,598
Ev'ry person you meet
Lihe the cop on the beat

907
01:20:17,807 --> 01:20:21,476
Leaves whatever he's doing
And crosses the street

908
01:20:21,643 --> 01:20:25,104
And your heart bobs around like a cork

909
01:20:25,271 --> 01:20:35,196
When you're out
With the belle of Mew Yorh
