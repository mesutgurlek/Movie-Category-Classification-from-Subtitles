1
00:01:27,070 --> 00:01:29,561
There it is, Herb.
One verse and two choruses.

2
00:01:29,739 --> 00:01:32,401
- Is this a good song, Eddie?
- It's a good song, Herb.

3
00:01:32,609 --> 00:01:35,009
- It's as good as the doll-dance number.
- All right.

4
00:01:53,663 --> 00:01:56,131
Skip the verse, do the chorus, tempo.

5
00:02:08,845 --> 00:02:10,073
Hot, eh?

6
00:02:15,652 --> 00:02:17,415
- Good morning.
- Hello, Jimmy.

7
00:02:17,587 --> 00:02:20,283
I've got the hottest song
you ever heard in your life.

8
00:02:20,456 --> 00:02:22,720
- Is that so?
- Yes, that's so.

9
00:02:22,892 --> 00:02:24,655
Got it? Have you got it?

10
00:02:25,395 --> 00:02:29,058
Jimmy, if you can get this crowd
to keep quiet, I'll sing it for you.

11
00:02:29,232 --> 00:02:31,462
- How about a little harmony?
- All right.

12
00:02:31,634 --> 00:02:33,761
Listen, let's go through it.
One and two.

13
00:02:33,937 --> 00:02:36,735
The second chorus,
a little jazz, a little pep.

14
00:02:36,906 --> 00:02:39,033
Come on, I'll vamp until ready.
Let's go.

15
00:02:39,209 --> 00:02:40,904
Go on, Herb.

16
00:02:41,077 --> 00:02:43,443
- That's it.
- The chorus in F-sharp.

17
00:04:09,599 --> 00:04:10,998
Hot dog!

18
00:04:13,636 --> 00:04:17,868
Listen, kid, if we can get that number,
we're a cinch for the Palace.

19
00:04:18,741 --> 00:04:20,470
- Hello, girls.
- Hello, Eddie.

20
00:04:20,643 --> 00:04:24,238
Listen, Eddie, we'll take that song
and smack it over for you.

21
00:04:24,414 --> 00:04:25,642
Sure!

22
00:04:25,815 --> 00:04:29,842
Oh, no. Not this song, babies.
Zanfield's bought it for his new revue.

23
00:04:30,019 --> 00:04:33,420
And the Mahoney Sisters are coming
from the West to put it over for me.

24
00:04:33,589 --> 00:04:37,320
Listen, Eddie, you're not gonna waste
a swell number like that...

25
00:04:37,493 --> 00:04:41,190
...on a smalltime sister act, are you?

26
00:04:41,364 --> 00:04:42,831
Nix cracking, Rosie.

27
00:04:42,999 --> 00:04:47,197
Half of that sister team is going to be
the future Mrs. Eddie Kearns.

28
00:04:47,370 --> 00:04:49,304
Wait a minute.
Wait a minute, Eddie.

29
00:04:49,472 --> 00:04:53,033
If you wanna be made overnight,
just give us a crack at that number.

30
00:04:53,209 --> 00:04:55,734
Oh, no. Oh, no.

31
00:04:55,912 --> 00:04:58,244
No, no. Positively not.

32
00:04:58,414 --> 00:05:01,474
I've gotta get back to the hotel.
The girls are waiting for me.

33
00:05:02,218 --> 00:05:04,709
Oh, but listen,
if you want a song...

34
00:05:04,887 --> 00:05:06,582
...see Georgie Cohan.

35
00:05:07,523 --> 00:05:09,991
He writes good music too.

36
00:05:12,195 --> 00:05:14,060
How about it, Jimmy?

37
00:05:20,103 --> 00:05:22,196
Oh, I'll take that, thank you.

38
00:05:23,606 --> 00:05:26,131
Gee, this is elegant, ain't it?

39
00:05:26,309 --> 00:05:28,869
Tell you better when
I get a peek at the beds.

40
00:05:34,017 --> 00:05:37,111
Quiet. I told you to pack
that cooking outfit in the trunk.

41
00:05:37,286 --> 00:05:39,720
Yeah? Well, I'm taking no chances.

42
00:05:39,889 --> 00:05:44,292
If we can't pay our bill and the hotel
holds the trunks, we still eat.

43
00:05:44,460 --> 00:05:47,486
And, baby, when you don't eat,
you lose a lot of calories.

44
00:05:47,663 --> 00:05:49,927
Calories? What are they?

45
00:05:50,099 --> 00:05:52,124
Oh, acrobats, you big sap.

46
00:05:52,301 --> 00:05:54,565
- Well, I never got fat on your cooking.
- No?

47
00:05:54,737 --> 00:05:57,137
You never got that complexion
from the Greeks.

48
00:05:57,306 --> 00:05:59,501
- Don't talk to me like...
- lxnay, ixnay.

49
00:05:59,675 --> 00:06:02,644
- Leave us plenty of towels too.
- I did.

50
00:06:02,812 --> 00:06:04,211
And I counted them.

51
00:06:04,380 --> 00:06:06,109
How high can you count?

52
00:06:06,282 --> 00:06:10,378
Well, everything's okay.
Will there be anything else?

53
00:06:10,553 --> 00:06:12,282
Yeah, food.

54
00:06:16,025 --> 00:06:20,018
I think he may stall for a tip. Get to the
window and give me the high sign.

55
00:06:20,196 --> 00:06:22,824
Hank, I don't wanna do that.
Don't be such a cheapskate.

56
00:06:22,999 --> 00:06:24,523
Screw.

57
00:06:29,072 --> 00:06:32,803
Say, did they run out of everything
but dollar signs on this thing?

58
00:06:36,679 --> 00:06:40,513
One coffee, one order of fried eggs.
There's two in an order, ain't they?

59
00:06:40,683 --> 00:06:43,117
- Yep.
- And one order of rolls.

60
00:06:43,586 --> 00:06:44,814
- Hank.
- Yes?

61
00:06:44,987 --> 00:06:46,614
Come look at the elegant view.

62
00:06:46,789 --> 00:06:49,417
Oh, that will be all, thank you.

63
00:06:51,994 --> 00:06:57,022
Cup of coffee, order of rolls,
a couple of eggs.

64
00:06:58,468 --> 00:06:59,935
It worked.

65
00:07:01,137 --> 00:07:02,832
Oh, Queenie, New York.

66
00:07:03,005 --> 00:07:05,405
The place we've dreamed
and talked about.

67
00:07:05,575 --> 00:07:08,271
- Ain't it swell?
- Yeah.

68
00:07:08,444 --> 00:07:11,174
But there's something about it
that scares me, Hank.

69
00:07:11,347 --> 00:07:14,748
Scares you?
Well, there's nothing to be afraid of.

70
00:07:16,385 --> 00:07:18,979
Well, it seems like we're taking
an awful chance.

71
00:07:19,155 --> 00:07:21,487
We were getting along so well out west.

72
00:07:21,657 --> 00:07:25,184
Plenty of work, small jumps,
a chance to save money.

73
00:07:25,361 --> 00:07:28,387
And the act always went over big.

74
00:07:28,564 --> 00:07:31,795
But here, nobody knows us.

75
00:07:31,968 --> 00:07:33,731
Oh, I'm afraid.

76
00:07:33,903 --> 00:07:35,803
Now don't lose your nerve, honey.

77
00:07:35,972 --> 00:07:38,406
But we haven't got much money.

78
00:07:38,574 --> 00:07:41,600
Oh, Hank, couldn't we go back,
just for one more year?

79
00:07:41,777 --> 00:07:44,405
Back to those opera houses
and town halls?

80
00:07:44,580 --> 00:07:48,846
Those cheap hotels
and their lobby comics?

81
00:07:51,521 --> 00:07:52,954
Cooking our own food...

82
00:07:53,122 --> 00:07:57,183
...washing our own clothes
and ironing them on mirrors.

83
00:07:57,360 --> 00:08:02,229
Riding in those smelly day-coaches.

84
00:08:02,398 --> 00:08:07,165
Going ragged all summer and then darn near
freezing in the winter. And why?

85
00:08:07,336 --> 00:08:11,136
Just to save money enough
to get to New York and show our act.

86
00:08:11,307 --> 00:08:12,638
Oh, honey.

87
00:08:12,808 --> 00:08:15,606
With your looks and my ability...

88
00:08:17,480 --> 00:08:19,778
I wouldn't steer you wrong.

89
00:08:21,517 --> 00:08:23,314
Now don't worry.

90
00:08:23,486 --> 00:08:26,011
You see that electric sign
of the fellow in BVDs?

91
00:08:26,189 --> 00:08:27,656
- Yeah.
- Well, right there...

92
00:08:27,823 --> 00:08:29,984
...they're gonna have
the Mahoney Sisters.

93
00:08:30,159 --> 00:08:32,719
- In BVDs?
- Yes, in BVD...

94
00:08:34,964 --> 00:08:37,990
Baby, they were plenty smart
when they made you beautiful.

95
00:08:38,167 --> 00:08:40,635
Come on, let's get cleaned up
before Eddie gets here.

96
00:08:40,803 --> 00:08:43,135
I'll run a tub for you.

97
00:08:48,578 --> 00:08:52,070
The Mahoney Sisters in BVDs.

98
00:09:08,364 --> 00:09:10,195
Hey, what are you singing?

99
00:09:10,366 --> 00:09:11,833
The bubble song from Lux.

100
00:09:12,001 --> 00:09:13,332
Will you join me?

101
00:09:13,502 --> 00:09:15,493
No use of us both getting wet.

102
00:09:15,671 --> 00:09:17,002
Will you wash mine?

103
00:09:17,173 --> 00:09:21,132
I might as well. You never wash
anything but your neck.

104
00:09:27,183 --> 00:09:29,481
I not only wash them.
I gotta pick them up.

105
00:09:29,652 --> 00:09:31,347
Oh, Hank, I didn't think.

106
00:09:31,520 --> 00:09:33,010
Oh, you never do.

107
00:09:33,189 --> 00:09:36,249
Oh, don't strain yourself.
I'll get them.

108
00:09:37,660 --> 00:09:40,288
Oh, boy, this is going to be good.

109
00:09:41,330 --> 00:09:42,957
Oh, I'll go.

110
00:09:47,403 --> 00:09:49,701
Can you imagine my embarrassment?

111
00:10:09,525 --> 00:10:10,992
Uncle Jed!

112
00:10:11,160 --> 00:10:13,424
Hello, honey. How are you?

113
00:10:13,596 --> 00:10:15,393
- Fine, and you?
- Great.

114
00:10:15,564 --> 00:10:19,330
- Gee, I'm glad to see you, Hank.
- Oh, Queenie, hurry up. It's Uncle Jed!

115
00:10:19,502 --> 00:10:20,833
Uncle Jed?

116
00:10:21,003 --> 00:10:22,265
I'll be right out.

117
00:10:22,438 --> 00:10:23,996
What a break for you.

118
00:10:24,173 --> 00:10:28,041
- I'll be with you in just a minute.
- All right, honey, but hurry.

119
00:10:32,481 --> 00:10:33,948
What do you know, Uncle Jed?

120
00:10:34,750 --> 00:10:38,516
I've got you booked for 30 weeks
over at the Manley Time.

121
00:10:39,055 --> 00:10:41,751
Nothing doing.
We're in New York to stay.

122
00:10:42,391 --> 00:10:44,256
Say, listen, girls...

123
00:10:44,427 --> 00:10:49,126
...you know, I know this town better
than you do. And there are more sisters...

124
00:10:49,298 --> 00:10:54,099
...doing their acts over the lunch counters
in New York than over the...

125
00:10:55,137 --> 00:10:56,832
Than in the theaters.

126
00:10:57,206 --> 00:10:59,401
You're just a crapehanger.

127
00:11:00,176 --> 00:11:04,010
Maybe, but let me tell you...

128
00:11:04,180 --> 00:11:07,946
...tell you, tell you, tell you...

129
00:11:08,117 --> 00:11:10,517
What's the name of that record
you're playing?

130
00:11:11,420 --> 00:11:13,251
Say, listen, girls...

131
00:11:14,890 --> 00:11:16,482
Yeah?

132
00:11:17,193 --> 00:11:18,956
Well, what is it?

133
00:11:20,796 --> 00:11:23,856
I love both you girls,
and I want to see you get along.

134
00:11:24,567 --> 00:11:26,865
Sure, Uncle Jed, we know that.

135
00:11:27,036 --> 00:11:32,064
But we aren't leaving this town till we
get a flash at Babe Ruth and Grant's Tomb.

136
00:11:33,743 --> 00:11:37,008
- Oh, will you get that, Uncle Jed?
- You bet.

137
00:11:46,155 --> 00:11:50,023
Oh, girls, your break... Your break...

138
00:11:50,192 --> 00:11:51,955
Your coffee's here.

139
00:11:56,332 --> 00:11:58,459
Bring the toothbrush glass
when you come.

140
00:11:58,634 --> 00:12:01,159
- All right.
- Will you have some coffee, Uncle Jed?

141
00:12:01,337 --> 00:12:04,829
No, thanks. I just had my breakf...
I just ate.

142
00:12:05,007 --> 00:12:06,304
- Yeah?
- Uncle Jed!

143
00:12:06,475 --> 00:12:07,999
Queenie!

144
00:12:08,177 --> 00:12:10,975
Gosh, what a big girl you are.

145
00:12:11,147 --> 00:12:14,742
- And so beautiful.
- Ain't she, though?

146
00:12:15,418 --> 00:12:18,080
Well, I suppose you've decided
to stay in New York.

147
00:12:18,254 --> 00:12:21,246
Yeah, we're all set.
But thanks for the offer, Uncle Jed.

148
00:12:21,424 --> 00:12:24,291
That's all right.
I'll keep it open for a few days.

149
00:12:24,460 --> 00:12:26,052
- All right.
- Goodbye.

150
00:12:27,763 --> 00:12:31,290
- Oh, goodbye, Uncle Jed.
- Lf you wanna see me, just call me up.

151
00:12:31,467 --> 00:12:33,628
Yeah, all right.
You're in the phone book?

152
00:12:33,803 --> 00:12:35,532
You bet.

153
00:12:40,576 --> 00:12:43,704
I think we're making an awful mistake
not to take that work.

154
00:12:43,879 --> 00:12:48,111
I know what I'm doing.
We stand as big a chance as anybody else.

155
00:12:48,717 --> 00:12:51,618
What did the Duncans have
when they hit Times Square?

156
00:12:51,821 --> 00:12:53,516
"My Patio."

157
00:12:54,323 --> 00:12:56,814
Say, we've got more than the Duncans
ever had.

158
00:12:56,992 --> 00:12:59,654
Well, the Duncans are pretty good too.

159
00:13:00,296 --> 00:13:02,696
Say, what'd we do to them
on the Gus Sun Time?

160
00:13:02,865 --> 00:13:05,959
We knocked them off their seats.
Come in.

161
00:13:07,970 --> 00:13:10,632
- Eddie!
- Hank!

162
00:13:13,742 --> 00:13:15,334
Oh, baby.

163
00:13:15,711 --> 00:13:17,611
Let me have a good look at you.

164
00:13:19,381 --> 00:13:24,785
- Gee, but it's good to see you.
- Oh, boy, is it good to see you! Oh, gee!

165
00:13:24,954 --> 00:13:26,717
That's my Queenie!

166
00:13:30,926 --> 00:13:34,862
- Queenie? You don't mean to tell me it's...
- Sure.

167
00:13:35,030 --> 00:13:37,328
Queenie, all grown up and everything.

168
00:13:37,500 --> 00:13:40,765
Ain't she? That sisterly kiss
won't be so hard to take now.

169
00:13:40,936 --> 00:13:42,301
I'll say it won't.

170
00:13:42,471 --> 00:13:44,837
- Take it big.
- I did.

171
00:13:45,274 --> 00:13:48,004
You were a funny-looking thing
the first time I saw you...

172
00:13:48,177 --> 00:13:50,771
...with those gangly legs and freckles.

173
00:13:51,480 --> 00:13:54,881
But you certainly turned out to be
a beautiful girl.

174
00:13:55,050 --> 00:13:57,177
Well, I'll go get some clothes on.

175
00:13:58,787 --> 00:14:02,587
I'm just crazy about her, Eddie.
She's so young and beautiful.

176
00:14:02,758 --> 00:14:04,521
Of course she is.

177
00:14:07,129 --> 00:14:10,690
Well, Hank, now that you're here,
when are we going to get married?

178
00:14:10,866 --> 00:14:14,461
Oh, not till we've put this act over.
I'm gonna give Queenie a break.

179
00:14:14,637 --> 00:14:17,765
Always doing something
for somebody else.

180
00:14:17,973 --> 00:14:20,271
No wonder I love you.

181
00:14:20,442 --> 00:14:23,809
- I kind of got a weakness for you too.
- Yeah?

182
00:14:23,979 --> 00:14:25,571
Mrs. Eddie Kearns?

183
00:14:25,748 --> 00:14:27,648
Sounds pretty good, doesn't it?

184
00:14:27,950 --> 00:14:29,315
Swell, Eddie.

185
00:14:29,485 --> 00:14:33,444
Yeah, and you can feature
that anytime in the electric lights.

186
00:14:34,890 --> 00:14:39,384
- Gee, still the same sweet kid, ain't you?
- Why, certainly.

187
00:14:40,195 --> 00:14:42,527
Hank, did you pack my new dress
in the trunk?

188
00:14:42,765 --> 00:14:44,733
I'll get it for you in a minute.

189
00:14:46,335 --> 00:14:48,030
Come here, Queenie.

190
00:14:50,039 --> 00:14:54,339
- Gee, I can't get over how she's changed.
- Well, you sure look elegant, Eddie.

191
00:14:54,510 --> 00:14:56,637
- Doesn't he, Hank?
- He's an eyeful.

192
00:14:56,812 --> 00:14:58,370
Three carats.

193
00:14:58,647 --> 00:14:59,909
Platinum.

194
00:15:00,082 --> 00:15:03,415
And here's the payoff.
Look, but don't laugh.

195
00:15:04,286 --> 00:15:05,810
Gold garters!

196
00:15:05,988 --> 00:15:08,218
Oh, Eddie, I always knew
you'd make good.

197
00:15:08,390 --> 00:15:12,952
Yeah, and I ain't forgetting that you're the
little girl that made me come to New York.

198
00:15:13,128 --> 00:15:16,154
Remember when I wanted to quit
and give the whole thing up...

199
00:15:16,332 --> 00:15:18,232
...and you made me stick it out?

200
00:15:18,400 --> 00:15:21,699
Well, now I'm gonna do
something for you.

201
00:15:21,870 --> 00:15:24,634
Zanfield's bought my new song,
"The Broadway Melody."

202
00:15:24,807 --> 00:15:26,672
And he's naming his revue after it.

203
00:15:26,842 --> 00:15:30,676
- But I've already spoken to him about you.
- You think we've got a chance?

204
00:15:30,846 --> 00:15:33,974
Chance? Don't be silly.
One word from me, and you're in.

205
00:15:34,149 --> 00:15:37,209
- Queenie, ain't that great?
- Sure, if it's true.

206
00:15:37,386 --> 00:15:40,082
True? You don't know
how I stand with Zanfield.

207
00:15:40,255 --> 00:15:42,951
- Lf we're in, what do we do?
- When do we start?

208
00:15:43,125 --> 00:15:44,615
And how much do we get?

209
00:15:44,793 --> 00:15:47,785
You're gonna sing
my "Broadway Melody" with me.

210
00:15:47,963 --> 00:15:50,363
The Mahoney Sisters and Eddie Kearns.

211
00:15:50,532 --> 00:15:53,399
Yeah, Eddie Kearns
and the Mahoney Sisters.

212
00:15:53,569 --> 00:15:55,867
Well, how does it go?

213
00:15:56,038 --> 00:15:59,804
How's it go? Now, listen, I sing a verse,
and you come in on the chorus.

214
00:15:59,975 --> 00:16:03,103
Then we do another chorus,
and then go into a little dance.

215
00:16:03,278 --> 00:16:06,179
- Give us an idea of the dance.
- I'll give you an idea.

216
00:16:55,330 --> 00:16:57,628
- Good?
- Swell, Eddie, do it again.

217
00:17:29,031 --> 00:17:32,330
Let's move back this table, kids.
We'll do our dance.

218
00:17:34,570 --> 00:17:35,798
All ready, girls?

219
00:17:35,971 --> 00:17:38,531
Come on, now, let's go.
There you are.

220
00:17:41,243 --> 00:17:43,609
Queenie, why don't you look at my feet?

221
00:17:44,346 --> 00:17:45,677
Look at her.

222
00:17:48,217 --> 00:17:50,082
Attagirl!

223
00:17:57,893 --> 00:17:59,520
You like that?

224
00:18:19,982 --> 00:18:21,609
Don't do that.

225
00:18:23,452 --> 00:18:25,352
Don't do that!

226
00:18:28,524 --> 00:18:31,584
Hey, wait a minute, wait a minute!

227
00:18:31,960 --> 00:18:35,054
- What's the matter with the left leg?
- I've got a headache.

228
00:18:35,230 --> 00:18:37,460
Go on, sit down,
take a load off your mind.

229
00:18:37,633 --> 00:18:42,366
- Don't talk to me like that. I don't feel well.
- Listen, don't answer me back, understand?

230
00:18:42,671 --> 00:18:44,468
Come here.

231
00:18:46,241 --> 00:18:48,436
There's Eddie. Hello, hey!

232
00:18:48,610 --> 00:18:51,374
Your rhythm is all wrong.
Nothing like I showed you.

233
00:18:51,547 --> 00:18:53,105
All right, now watch.

234
00:18:57,786 --> 00:18:59,845
- Hello, Eddie.
- Hello, how are you?

235
00:19:00,022 --> 00:19:02,957
We had a tough time getting in!
When do we show the act?

236
00:19:03,125 --> 00:19:04,717
In a few minutes.

237
00:19:05,027 --> 00:19:07,495
I haven't had a chance
to talk to Zanfield yet.

238
00:19:07,663 --> 00:19:09,494
- It's okay, ain't it?
- We're in?

239
00:19:09,665 --> 00:19:11,895
Sure, it's in the bank.

240
00:19:12,501 --> 00:19:14,935
- Whatever I say goes.
- Hey, Kearns!

241
00:19:15,671 --> 00:19:17,332
Yes, sir?

242
00:19:20,676 --> 00:19:23,338
We don't wanna take all afternoon
to set one dance.

243
00:19:23,512 --> 00:19:24,740
Yes, sir.

244
00:19:24,913 --> 00:19:27,143
Maybe we'd better get undressed.
Come on.

245
00:19:27,316 --> 00:19:29,045
All right, Sam, let it go.

246
00:19:33,088 --> 00:19:37,252
- Oh, George.
- Wait a minute, hold it there. Hold it, Sam.

247
00:19:37,426 --> 00:19:40,122
The sets are all ready
for your okay, Mr. Zanfield.

248
00:19:40,295 --> 00:19:42,855
That's just an idea
of what it's gonna be.

249
00:19:43,031 --> 00:19:45,795
I can see that. It's just an idea.

250
00:19:45,968 --> 00:19:47,799
Yes, sir. Yes, sir.

251
00:19:47,970 --> 00:19:50,200
But don't worry, I'll fix it.

252
00:19:51,440 --> 00:19:53,567
- Okay on those sets.
- Yes, sir.

253
00:19:53,742 --> 00:19:57,644
Remind me to see that rehearsal
in the morning. Make a note of that.

254
00:19:57,813 --> 00:19:59,872
I'm having lunch at the Knickerbocker.

255
00:20:00,048 --> 00:20:04,985
Oh, Mr. Zanfield, this material, I couldn't
get it in the gold design, only in the silver.

256
00:20:05,153 --> 00:20:08,850
- Isn't it lovely?
- It's fine. Get it in the gold.

257
00:20:09,024 --> 00:20:11,549
- Remember, I want that in the gold.
- Yes, sir.

258
00:20:11,727 --> 00:20:16,391
Oh, Mr. Zanfield, pardon me, will you take
a look at the Mahoney Sisters right now?

259
00:20:16,565 --> 00:20:19,295
- The Maloney Sisters?
- No, the Mahoney Sisters.

260
00:20:19,468 --> 00:20:23,461
- Who are they? I never heard of them.
- It's the sister act I told you about.

261
00:20:23,639 --> 00:20:26,437
- Where are they?
- Right over there, across stage.

262
00:20:45,661 --> 00:20:48,721
All right, wheel them in.

263
00:20:48,964 --> 00:20:52,866
- Tell George I'll take a look at the act.
- Thanks, Mr. Zanfield.

264
00:20:54,970 --> 00:20:57,495
Well, kids, you all set?
Got your music?

265
00:20:57,673 --> 00:21:00,233
Well, go over there and tell him
what you want.

266
00:21:00,776 --> 00:21:02,869
The Baloney Sisters.

267
00:21:06,481 --> 00:21:10,508
Give us the introduction pickup
and some choruses. And swell to the finish.

268
00:21:10,686 --> 00:21:12,483
- But you follow us.
- Yes, ma'am.

269
00:21:12,654 --> 00:21:15,987
Sam, looks like some carnival
lost a good act.

270
00:21:20,429 --> 00:21:22,920
I'm gonna lay that dame
like a roll of linoleum.

271
00:21:23,098 --> 00:21:27,125
- Hank, you can't pull that around here.
- Hank, don't start anything now.

272
00:21:27,302 --> 00:21:30,703
- Get her in the dressing room.
- Sure. Now, come on. Get together.

273
00:21:30,872 --> 00:21:33,136
- All set now?
- Oh, wait a minute.

274
00:21:33,542 --> 00:21:35,772
- Don't mind if I put this down?
- No, ma'am.

275
00:21:35,944 --> 00:21:39,812
I'll vamp till ready, and don't forget:
We do things intimately.

276
00:21:40,615 --> 00:21:43,982
- All set.
- All set, fine. Babies, smack it over big.

277
00:21:44,152 --> 00:21:47,918
You ain't got nothing to worry about.
You're as good as in now.

278
00:21:48,090 --> 00:21:50,888
- I'll go and see how the boss likes it.
- All right.

279
00:21:51,193 --> 00:21:52,922
Well, all right, shoot.

280
00:22:16,952 --> 00:22:19,682
- Play it, will you?
- Something wrong with the piano.

281
00:22:19,855 --> 00:22:23,256
- Do I have to come over and play it for you?
- Okay, go ahead.

282
00:22:35,971 --> 00:22:37,438
What's the matter with them?

283
00:22:37,606 --> 00:22:40,074
There's something wrong with the piano.

284
00:22:40,308 --> 00:22:43,835
- Say, are you trying to crab our act?
- No, I'm not.

285
00:22:44,012 --> 00:22:47,345
- Well, will you play it then, hot or cold?
- Well, go ahead then.

286
00:22:50,452 --> 00:22:52,443
All right. All right, girls.

287
00:22:52,621 --> 00:22:55,784
Mr. Zanfield's seen enough.
He'll let you know. Come in next Friday.

288
00:22:55,957 --> 00:23:00,587
- But he ain't seen the finish yet.
- Yes. I know, all right. Line up, girls.

289
00:23:00,762 --> 00:23:04,596
Oh, Mr. Zanfield, please give them a break.
You haven't seen their act.

290
00:23:04,766 --> 00:23:06,495
I saw enough.

291
00:23:07,235 --> 00:23:10,432
I can use the blond,
but that little cluck is out.

292
00:23:10,605 --> 00:23:14,006
But don't you know it's tough
to put comedy over on a bare stage?

293
00:23:14,176 --> 00:23:17,737
They'll be all right at the performance.
Give them another chance.

294
00:23:17,913 --> 00:23:19,244
I know, Eddie.

295
00:23:19,514 --> 00:23:24,611
Gee, kid, that's a tough break. Even if the
act is a louse, he should've seen the finish.

296
00:23:24,786 --> 00:23:26,617
It ain't a louse. It's a good act.

297
00:23:26,788 --> 00:23:29,916
We stopped the show
every performance we did for Jake Wells.

298
00:23:30,092 --> 00:23:32,754
Yeah, the one I saw would stop a tank.

299
00:23:32,928 --> 00:23:35,988
Say, you've been asking for trouble,
and now you're gonna get it.

300
00:23:36,164 --> 00:23:40,567
You great big peroxide-headed dizzy blond,
you! What do you think of this act?

301
00:23:43,138 --> 00:23:45,732
Hey, come here! Come here, girls!

302
00:23:46,174 --> 00:23:47,801
Come here!

303
00:23:51,279 --> 00:23:53,372
Let me at her, will you?
Let me at her!

304
00:23:53,582 --> 00:23:56,415
Next time I'll give you a facial
instead of a scalp treatment.

305
00:23:56,585 --> 00:23:59,577
- Yeah, and I'll fix you, you little peanut.
- Let go of me!

306
00:23:59,754 --> 00:24:03,349
- Oh, boy, I'll sock her...
- Stop it, Hank, you're crabbing everything.

307
00:24:03,525 --> 00:24:05,789
Go get your clothes on.
I'll fix everything.

308
00:24:05,961 --> 00:24:09,897
The big blond baboon! Why'd she pick
on me? I didn't start any fight with her.

309
00:24:10,065 --> 00:24:12,056
- Where's my music?
- Here's your music.

310
00:24:12,234 --> 00:24:15,829
- Well, where's my bag?
- Now, be quiet. Be quiet, Hank!

311
00:24:16,004 --> 00:24:19,963
Get in there. Straighten it out.
Let's get smart, Sam. Where are you?

312
00:24:20,142 --> 00:24:22,133
Don't let them throw you
up in the air.

313
00:24:22,310 --> 00:24:25,973
I'm not gonna waste all day at it.
Give me a pickup and two choruses.

314
00:24:26,148 --> 00:24:31,017
And let me tell you dames something:
If I get ahold of her, I'll rip her wide open.

315
00:24:33,822 --> 00:24:35,517
Flo, what was the trouble about?

316
00:24:35,690 --> 00:24:38,818
- I was beside the piano, not doing a thing...
- Wait a minute.

317
00:24:38,994 --> 00:24:41,690
- I can't stand for quarreling.
- I didn't start it.

318
00:24:41,863 --> 00:24:45,390
Never mind who started it. Now
run along and be a good little girl.

319
00:24:45,567 --> 00:24:48,400
- Oh, all right.
- And remember, no more quarreling.

320
00:24:51,640 --> 00:24:54,700
- Excuse me, Mr. Zanfield.
- Well?

321
00:24:55,644 --> 00:24:58,112
I heard what you said about me.

322
00:24:58,280 --> 00:25:01,772
Please, couldn't you use the both of us
at the same salary?

323
00:25:02,083 --> 00:25:05,746
I might.
I think I can slip her in somewhere.

324
00:25:05,921 --> 00:25:09,379
- Oh, thank you, Mr. Zanfield!
- All right.

325
00:25:13,562 --> 00:25:17,123
My sister is the business manager
of the act.

326
00:25:17,766 --> 00:25:21,293
You won't let on that it ain't
the both of us you want, will you?

327
00:25:21,469 --> 00:25:22,834
Of course not.

328
00:25:23,004 --> 00:25:26,531
- You send her over, and I'll talk to her.
- Oh, thank you!

329
00:25:27,342 --> 00:25:29,071
All right.

330
00:25:32,547 --> 00:25:34,344
Oh, Hank!

331
00:25:36,051 --> 00:25:39,680
He can take his old show and put it
where it'll do him the most good!

332
00:25:39,854 --> 00:25:43,085
Don't act like that, Hank.
He didn't see your act, that's all.

333
00:25:43,258 --> 00:25:45,283
- He's a very busy man.
- Oh, he's busy?

334
00:25:45,460 --> 00:25:48,020
Well, so am I busy,
with 30 weeks waiting for me.

335
00:25:48,196 --> 00:25:51,029
- Now, don't get so excited over nothing.
- Hank, quick!

336
00:25:51,199 --> 00:25:52,791
Mr. Zanfield wants to see you.

337
00:25:52,968 --> 00:25:55,095
- Oh, yeah?
- On the level?

338
00:25:55,270 --> 00:25:57,170
- Maybe we're in after all.
- Sure!

339
00:25:57,339 --> 00:26:01,901
Let me handle this. I can always take care
of these things better with nobody around.

340
00:26:02,077 --> 00:26:03,874
I'll talk to him.

341
00:26:04,045 --> 00:26:08,311
All right, girls, we'll take this right from
the beginning. Okay, Sam, let it go.

342
00:26:08,850 --> 00:26:11,250
I heard what you said to Zanny.

343
00:26:12,187 --> 00:26:16,624
- You won't let on to Hank, will you, Eddie?
- Of course not.

344
00:26:16,791 --> 00:26:19,726
Gee, that was wonderful of you,
Queenie.

345
00:26:21,363 --> 00:26:23,388
I could kiss you for that.

346
00:26:30,939 --> 00:26:33,567
You mustn't do that, Eddie.

347
00:26:34,309 --> 00:26:36,038
I guess I shouldn't.

348
00:26:36,645 --> 00:26:39,079
I never realized you were...

349
00:26:40,282 --> 00:26:43,774
Gee, you're the sweetest little girl
I ever knew.

350
00:26:45,587 --> 00:26:47,851
You mean next to Hank.

351
00:26:48,223 --> 00:26:50,987
Yeah, sure.

352
00:26:52,027 --> 00:26:56,020
You know, Hank's been everything
in the world to me.

353
00:26:56,197 --> 00:27:02,158
She's looked after me and worked for me,
and fought for me, protected me.

354
00:27:02,337 --> 00:27:07,001
I could never repay her
for all her love and care.

355
00:27:07,409 --> 00:27:09,468
Of course you love her, Queenie.

356
00:27:09,644 --> 00:27:12,579
And you're gonna be everything
that she wants you to be.

357
00:27:12,747 --> 00:27:15,181
And I don't blame her for loving you.

358
00:27:16,685 --> 00:27:19,552
Gee, but you're a cute kid.

359
00:27:20,622 --> 00:27:22,817
And she loves you, Eddie.

360
00:27:23,692 --> 00:27:27,253
I guess you and me are about all
she ever thinks of.

361
00:27:27,429 --> 00:27:32,765
Oh, I never wanna hurt her, Eddie.
And I want her to be happy with you.

362
00:27:33,335 --> 00:27:36,771
Why, Queenie, I'd rather lose my pipes
so I couldn't sing...

363
00:27:36,938 --> 00:27:41,341
...and go lame so I couldn't dance
than to hurt Hank.

364
00:27:41,509 --> 00:27:43,636
- Sure you would. So would I.
- Can you imagine?

365
00:27:43,812 --> 00:27:46,474
- We're in! Rehearsal in the morning!
- That's great!

366
00:27:46,648 --> 00:27:49,674
- I knew you'd put it over, Hank!
- Oh, just leave it to me!

367
00:27:49,851 --> 00:27:53,252
I ain't booked acts for 10 years
and not know how to handle them!

368
00:27:53,421 --> 00:27:55,855
- You bet you haven't!
- You're both swell kids!

369
00:27:56,024 --> 00:27:58,254
- And plenty smart!
- And how!

370
00:27:58,426 --> 00:28:01,520
- Gee, rehearsal in the morning! Ain't it great?
- Yeah!

371
00:28:01,696 --> 00:28:04,290
Come on.
I got a lot of washing and ironing to do.

372
00:28:04,466 --> 00:28:07,924
- You have?
- I want you to look your best, honey.

373
00:28:08,103 --> 00:28:11,436
But tell me, how did you put it over?
What did you say to him?

374
00:28:11,606 --> 00:28:16,043
I said to him, "Now, you listen here,
Mr. Zanfield, this is a sister team.

375
00:28:16,211 --> 00:28:18,145
And we splits up for nobody!"

376
00:28:18,313 --> 00:28:20,907
And with that,
he smiled as nice as you please...

377
00:28:21,082 --> 00:28:24,245
...and said, "That's all right, Miss Maloney."

378
00:28:24,419 --> 00:28:28,412
Can you imagine calling me Maloney?
And everybody knows our name's Mahoney.

379
00:28:28,590 --> 00:28:31,024
- Yeah, can you imagine that?
- Imagine that.

380
00:28:31,192 --> 00:28:32,682
"Maloney"!

381
00:28:53,014 --> 00:28:55,505
Hey, come on and get those
clothes on, will you?

382
00:28:55,683 --> 00:28:57,913
- Hurry up!
- Well, are we all set?

383
00:28:58,086 --> 00:29:00,953
Yes, sir, everything ready to go
when you say the word.

384
00:29:01,122 --> 00:29:02,749
All right.

385
00:29:03,091 --> 00:29:04,991
- Are you safe up there, Audrey?
- Okay.

386
00:29:05,160 --> 00:29:06,684
Yes, that's perfectly safe.

387
00:29:06,861 --> 00:29:09,352
- You get the orchestra in the pit.
- Yes, sir.

388
00:29:09,531 --> 00:29:11,431
- Oh, Hagerty.
- Yes?

389
00:29:12,333 --> 00:29:15,393
- That looks very good.
- I think it'll be very effective.

390
00:29:15,570 --> 00:29:18,061
- So do I.
- Yes, sir.

391
00:29:18,907 --> 00:29:23,241
Can you imagine? Putting on all this makeup
for just one show a day?

392
00:29:23,778 --> 00:29:26,679
Oh, dear! I'm just shaky all over.

393
00:29:27,449 --> 00:29:30,680
Queenie, will you stop?
You're getting me nervous now.

394
00:29:31,553 --> 00:29:34,249
It ain't a bit different
than it was in Reading, PA.

395
00:29:34,422 --> 00:29:36,413
And we're going over just as big.

396
00:29:36,591 --> 00:29:40,857
- Oh, Hank, do you think so?
- Why, it's cream in the can, baby.

397
00:29:41,896 --> 00:29:43,887
- Are you decent, girls?
- Yeah, come in.

398
00:29:44,065 --> 00:29:46,090
Oh, Hank, get a load of this.

399
00:29:46,434 --> 00:29:49,926
"Big mammoth appearance
of the Mahoney Sisters on Broadway.

400
00:29:50,305 --> 00:29:53,672
Zanfield saw them once,
and they were in.

401
00:29:53,842 --> 00:29:58,040
With appreciation and regards
to our agent, Uncle Jed."

402
00:29:58,213 --> 00:30:00,545
- Is that a pippin or not?
- You care for that?

403
00:30:00,715 --> 00:30:03,149
- Do I?
- Hank, will you get Eddie out of here?

404
00:30:03,318 --> 00:30:05,047
I'm nervous!

405
00:30:05,220 --> 00:30:06,881
What's eating her?

406
00:30:07,522 --> 00:30:10,821
Eddie, you gotta run along now.
We're nervous.

407
00:30:10,992 --> 00:30:12,391
I get you.

408
00:30:18,032 --> 00:30:20,296
Now, Queenie, don't be nervous.

409
00:30:20,468 --> 00:30:24,131
- Remember, this is your big opportunity.
- Will you get out of here?

410
00:30:24,305 --> 00:30:27,866
- Beat it, Eddie, will you?
- Now, don't forget, a lot depends on this.

411
00:30:28,042 --> 00:30:29,942
- Oh, get out!
- Get out!

412
00:30:36,317 --> 00:30:39,844
Stop, stop! Girls, girls!

413
00:30:40,021 --> 00:30:43,081
- Be careful of my hats!
- We gotta get down on the stage!

414
00:30:43,258 --> 00:30:45,590
I don't care!
I won't allow you to ruin them.

415
00:30:45,760 --> 00:30:48,456
I told you they were
too high and too wide.

416
00:30:48,630 --> 00:30:52,589
Well, big woman, I design
the costumes for the show...

417
00:30:52,767 --> 00:30:54,496
...not the doors for the theater.

418
00:30:54,669 --> 00:30:58,070
I know that. If you had,
they'd have been done in lavender.

419
00:31:10,552 --> 00:31:14,682
Pardon me, Mr. Zanfield, but the orchestra's
killing my "Broadway Melody" number.

420
00:31:14,856 --> 00:31:18,690
- Too much brass. They can't hear me.
- Kearns, tell them to keep it down.

421
00:31:18,860 --> 00:31:20,953
Thanks, Mr. Zanfield.

422
00:31:21,529 --> 00:31:24,259
- All right, boys, I think we can go.
- Yes, sir!

423
00:31:30,371 --> 00:31:31,599
Hey, you!

424
00:31:31,773 --> 00:31:35,436
When you get through with that noise,
try and play my number.

425
00:31:35,610 --> 00:31:38,875
Cut out the brass,
and keep it very piano.

426
00:31:39,047 --> 00:31:40,537
Are you back again?

427
00:31:40,715 --> 00:31:43,240
Yes, and I'm telling you
how I want my music played.

428
00:31:43,418 --> 00:31:46,080
I've conducted opera.
What do you know about music?

429
00:31:46,254 --> 00:31:49,849
- Nothing. I only wrote it, that's all.
- Then you have the best of me.

430
00:31:50,024 --> 00:31:51,389
You don't have to listen.

431
00:31:51,559 --> 00:31:54,084
I'll tell Zanny what a sap he was
for buying it.

432
00:31:54,262 --> 00:31:56,958
Maybe he'll get you
to write the music for the show.

433
00:31:57,131 --> 00:31:58,928
If I couldn't do better than this...

434
00:31:59,100 --> 00:32:01,694
If you could,
you wouldn't be waving a stick!

435
00:32:02,704 --> 00:32:06,140
Electrician!
A little more this way with that spotlight.

436
00:32:06,307 --> 00:32:09,105
What are you trying to do,
ruin my profile?

437
00:32:09,277 --> 00:32:11,677
Your profile was ruined the day
you were born.

438
00:32:11,846 --> 00:32:16,112
That's a smart crack.
Hit me with it and keep it here.

439
00:32:16,417 --> 00:32:19,443
Hey, put that spotlight
over here on this girl!

440
00:32:19,854 --> 00:32:23,085
- He wants it over there.
- But it goes over here.

441
00:32:23,257 --> 00:32:26,749
That spotlight goes here.
I can't sing without a spotlight.

442
00:32:26,928 --> 00:32:29,419
Say, you couldn't sing
if you had a searchlight.

443
00:32:29,664 --> 00:32:32,690
- Did you get everything you wanted?
- Pardon me, Mr. Zanfield.

444
00:32:32,867 --> 00:32:35,734
Would you okay this bill
for Miss William's second act?

445
00:32:35,903 --> 00:32:40,306
What's the idea? Two grand for a coat worn
for less than three minutes? I won't pay it!

446
00:32:40,475 --> 00:32:42,466
But you said ermine.

447
00:32:43,878 --> 00:32:46,403
You'll giggle yourself
right out of here one day.

448
00:32:46,581 --> 00:32:48,242
Yes, sir.

449
00:32:48,416 --> 00:32:52,011
- It's a gorgeous garment, isn't it?
- Isn't it gorgeous?

450
00:32:52,186 --> 00:32:57,021
In fact, it's the gorgeous-est thing
I have ever seen. You sweet little cutie!

451
00:32:57,191 --> 00:33:00,183
- There you are.
- Thank you, Mr. Zanfield.

452
00:33:00,361 --> 00:33:02,852
- Come here, Unconscious.
- Hello, boys.

453
00:33:03,031 --> 00:33:07,195
Say, Joe LeBlanc saw the rehearsal,
and he says there's a fortune in the show.

454
00:33:07,368 --> 00:33:11,065
- Yes, sir!
- We ought to know. We put it in.

455
00:33:11,239 --> 00:33:14,606
- You think it's a good show then, Zanny?
- It's just an oil well.

456
00:33:14,776 --> 00:33:17,301
- Let's see your gusher.
- Looks like a mine to me.

457
00:33:17,478 --> 00:33:19,742
From all the gold-diggers
you got in the troupe.

458
00:33:19,914 --> 00:33:25,284
Any old time one of them can pry a nugget
off of his ledge, they're going some!

459
00:33:25,453 --> 00:33:27,819
Come on, Unconscious, put the load down.

460
00:33:28,856 --> 00:33:31,723
Overture, girls.
This is the "Broadway Melody" number.

461
00:33:31,926 --> 00:33:34,394
Get out of here and hurry up.

462
00:33:34,562 --> 00:33:38,658
Come on. Come on. Get out of here.
Come on. Go on, get out.

463
00:33:39,067 --> 00:33:42,730
Oh, there's the overture.
Oh, where's my hat?

464
00:33:42,904 --> 00:33:44,565
Where's my hat?

465
00:33:45,206 --> 00:33:47,936
Where's my hat?
Oh, where's my hat?!

466
00:33:48,109 --> 00:33:49,440
- Over there!
- Over where?

467
00:33:49,610 --> 00:33:52,511
- On the floor, under the clothes.
- Oh, yes. The clothes carton.

468
00:33:52,680 --> 00:33:55,808
Why didn't you say so in the first place?
And make it snappy.

469
00:33:55,983 --> 00:33:57,678
- Are you ready?
- Yes.

470
00:33:57,852 --> 00:34:00,548
Now, honey, remember:
The dress rehearsal is tougher...

471
00:34:00,722 --> 00:34:03,247
...than a first-night performance.
So don't be nervous.

472
00:34:03,424 --> 00:34:05,255
- I'm not nervous.
- Neither am I.

473
00:34:08,062 --> 00:34:10,963
No, it's over that shoulder.
That's the idea.

474
00:34:11,132 --> 00:34:13,157
More. With those beads.

475
00:34:13,668 --> 00:34:16,762
That's it. That's better.
That's the idea. In this...

476
00:34:24,145 --> 00:34:26,705
All right! Out of the way.
Clear the way.

477
00:34:26,881 --> 00:34:28,712
Elgin, call a doctor.

478
00:34:28,883 --> 00:34:32,148
Elgin! Call a doctor! Elgin!

479
00:34:34,055 --> 00:34:36,319
What are we gonna do?

480
00:35:46,360 --> 00:35:49,921
Wait a minute. Wait a minute.
Hold it!

481
00:35:50,264 --> 00:35:52,732
That number's too slow.
Cut out the Maloney Sisters.

482
00:35:52,900 --> 00:35:54,731
- Cut out the whole first chorus?
- Yes.

483
00:35:54,969 --> 00:35:56,800
Why, has he cut us out altogether?

484
00:35:56,971 --> 00:36:00,372
Ain't it awful, the way
they cut out these big stars?

485
00:36:00,541 --> 00:36:02,509
I'll get to you in a minute.

486
00:36:02,677 --> 00:36:05,373
Listen here, Mr. Zanfield,
you can't cut us out like that.

487
00:36:05,546 --> 00:36:07,036
We've got equity contract.

488
00:36:07,215 --> 00:36:10,844
Kearns, go into the dance
on the first chorus and end it there.

489
00:36:11,018 --> 00:36:14,613
One more cut for you, dearie,
and you'll be holding a spear.

490
00:36:14,789 --> 00:36:18,281
And one more crack from you, bimbo,
and you'll be holding a lily.

491
00:36:18,459 --> 00:36:20,086
Listen to me, Mr. Zanfield, we...

492
00:36:20,261 --> 00:36:23,719
Keep quiet. Will you cut it out
and give me a chance to do my number?

493
00:36:23,898 --> 00:36:26,662
But he cut us out of the whole show.
He can't do that.

494
00:38:51,078 --> 00:38:54,241
Did you hear that, Mr. Zanfield?
They're trying to drown me out.

495
00:38:54,415 --> 00:38:58,010
- Are you trying to drown him out?
- We're doing our best.

496
00:38:58,586 --> 00:39:01,953
Mr. Zanfield, would you come backstage
a moment? It's very important.

497
00:39:02,123 --> 00:39:05,388
- All right.
- Yes, sir.

498
00:39:10,431 --> 00:39:11,557
What's the trouble now?

499
00:39:11,732 --> 00:39:14,223
The other dame flopped.
How about this one?

500
00:39:19,807 --> 00:39:21,069
No, sir.

501
00:39:21,242 --> 00:39:23,403
- Terrible.
- What are we gonna do about her?

502
00:39:23,577 --> 00:39:27,638
There he is now.
I'm gonna give that guy an earful.

503
00:39:27,815 --> 00:39:30,147
Where's that blond McGinty sister?
Use her.

504
00:39:30,317 --> 00:39:33,582
Mahoney's the name,
and let me tell you something...

505
00:39:33,754 --> 00:39:35,984
Excuse me, Mr. Zanfield.
I'll get her up there.

506
00:39:36,157 --> 00:39:39,558
You may not know it, but we've
played some of the very best...

507
00:39:40,094 --> 00:39:42,289
Listen, we want you
on the prow of that boat.

508
00:39:42,463 --> 00:39:44,590
Come on now.
Let's get your clothes off.

509
00:39:44,765 --> 00:39:47,097
But I don't want
to take my clothes off.

510
00:39:47,268 --> 00:39:48,792
No, that'll be all right.

511
00:39:48,969 --> 00:39:52,029
But listen to me. I've never taken
my clothes off in my life.

512
00:39:52,206 --> 00:39:53,764
I know all about that. Come on.

513
00:39:53,941 --> 00:39:56,842
- How've you got this thing hooked?
- I don't know.

514
00:39:57,011 --> 00:39:59,138
Over here.

515
00:39:59,413 --> 00:40:02,507
Say, do I get that spot, or don't I?

516
00:40:09,457 --> 00:40:11,186
That's tough. I missed him.

517
00:40:11,692 --> 00:40:15,526
- How's everything going, Zanny?
- Very smoothly. Very, very smoothly.

518
00:40:15,696 --> 00:40:17,425
- That's fine.
- Great.

519
00:40:17,598 --> 00:40:18,929
Sit down with us.

520
00:42:31,498 --> 00:42:33,466
Oh, Jules. Jules.

521
00:42:33,634 --> 00:42:36,899
I like that number.
That's a very good arrangement.

522
00:42:37,071 --> 00:42:39,198
How do you do it?
Where do you pick them?

523
00:42:39,373 --> 00:42:40,772
I guess it's just a gift.

524
00:42:40,941 --> 00:42:43,808
By the way, what's the name
of that little beauty on the boat?

525
00:42:43,978 --> 00:42:45,775
Ask her.
It'll give you something to do.

526
00:42:45,946 --> 00:42:48,414
- That's a great idea.
- Come on, Unconscious.

527
00:42:48,582 --> 00:42:50,311
Yes, sir.

528
00:42:50,884 --> 00:42:53,114
- You were great, Mahoney.
- I'll say you were.

529
00:42:53,287 --> 00:42:56,552
- You'll be in a Rolls-Royce by Thursday.
- Go on.

530
00:42:56,724 --> 00:42:59,420
What a flock of Johns will
be waiting at that stage door!

531
00:42:59,593 --> 00:43:02,118
- Go on. You can't kid me.
- I'm not kidding you.

532
00:43:02,296 --> 00:43:04,560
I may be there myself.

533
00:43:04,732 --> 00:43:07,758
- Oh, Queenie.
- Go in and change.

534
00:43:08,535 --> 00:43:11,095
Hank, did you see Queenie?

535
00:43:11,639 --> 00:43:14,665
What's the matter, Hank?
Aren't you happy?

536
00:43:14,842 --> 00:43:17,970
Wasn't Queenie great?
Aren't you proud of her?

537
00:43:18,145 --> 00:43:21,979
Of course, Eddie.
I'm glad to see her make good.

538
00:43:22,149 --> 00:43:26,586
Oh, but gee, we ain't never had
to get by on our legs before.

539
00:43:26,754 --> 00:43:28,813
Oh, that don't mean nothing, Hank.

540
00:43:28,989 --> 00:43:32,049
Those guys are not gonna pay 10 bucks
to look at your face.

541
00:43:32,226 --> 00:43:33,818
This is Broadway.

542
00:43:33,994 --> 00:43:37,122
Yeah. Broad's way.

543
00:43:37,931 --> 00:43:41,128
Now, run along and change.
I'll get Queenie.

544
00:43:41,302 --> 00:43:43,099
Attagirl.

545
00:43:45,506 --> 00:43:49,237
Queenie, everybody is raving about you.

546
00:43:49,410 --> 00:43:53,312
- Gee, but you're a beautiful kid.
- I'm glad you like me, Eddie.

547
00:43:53,480 --> 00:43:57,507
Like you? Oh, boy. When I got a peek
at you up there on that boat...

548
00:43:57,685 --> 00:44:01,121
- Isn't this the beautiful lady of the boat?
- Yes.

549
00:44:01,288 --> 00:44:04,655
- Kearns. They're waiting for you.
- Yes, sir.

550
00:44:06,427 --> 00:44:08,292
- I'm Jock Warriner.
- How do you do?

551
00:44:08,462 --> 00:44:11,454
- And this is Stew and Bay.
- How do you do?

552
00:44:11,632 --> 00:44:16,160
I bet them that the most beautiful girl
in New York will have supper with us.

553
00:44:16,337 --> 00:44:19,898
- You've got to help me win that bet.
- What have I got to do with that?

554
00:44:20,074 --> 00:44:24,477
- Well, you see, you're the girl.
- Oh, no, I'm not.

555
00:44:27,281 --> 00:44:30,842
- I guess we win that bet, Jock.
- Now, wait a minute. Not yet.

556
00:44:31,018 --> 00:44:34,476
- Hey, Unconscious, where you going?
- I'm gonna get on that boat.

557
00:44:34,655 --> 00:44:37,852
Come here, sap. You can't get on that.
That's not a real boat.

558
00:44:38,592 --> 00:44:42,494
Please.
Please, won't you change your mind?

559
00:44:42,963 --> 00:44:47,195
- I'm sorry, but really, I can't.
- Oh, come on. Please do.

560
00:44:47,368 --> 00:44:50,804
- No. Not tonight.
- No?

561
00:44:54,341 --> 00:44:59,040
- Come on. Slip us the 50.
- Wait a minute. I haven't lost yet.

562
00:44:59,213 --> 00:45:01,681
Oh, yeah...?
Come here, Unconscious, come here.

563
00:45:01,849 --> 00:45:05,808
You can't go up there, you'll get kicked out.
It's a ladies' dressing room.

564
00:45:05,986 --> 00:45:10,082
- Let's go on the boat.
- On the boat. Get out of here.

565
00:45:16,930 --> 00:45:19,524
Don't worry, Hank.
They only cut one number.

566
00:45:19,700 --> 00:45:21,827
We got a couple of others.

567
00:45:24,037 --> 00:45:27,097
"Zanny saw them once,
and they were in."

568
00:45:27,574 --> 00:45:29,439
Zanny saw me once, and I was out.

569
00:45:29,610 --> 00:45:32,170
Not altogether. And what of it?

570
00:45:32,346 --> 00:45:34,007
Yeah, I know.

571
00:45:35,215 --> 00:45:39,151
Do you think that's all I'll get to do,
go on without any clothes on?

572
00:45:39,319 --> 00:45:42,049
Not if I can help it.
But you don't need to worry.

573
00:45:42,222 --> 00:45:44,782
You got a lot more on
when you ain't got anything...

574
00:45:44,958 --> 00:45:47,358
...than most of the dames
I've seen around here.

575
00:45:49,229 --> 00:45:52,062
Well, I guess I'll go get
undressed again.

576
00:45:58,138 --> 00:45:59,833
Come in.

577
00:46:00,140 --> 00:46:02,700
- Hello, kids. Are you all ready?
- Yep. All ready.

578
00:46:02,876 --> 00:46:06,403
Well, listen. Zanny is giving
a big party at his apartment tonight.

579
00:46:06,580 --> 00:46:09,913
- Let's go over.
- Gee, that's great. Did he invite us?

580
00:46:10,083 --> 00:46:14,281
Not exactly, but what's the difference?
Ain't I the star of this troupe?

581
00:46:14,455 --> 00:46:16,548
That guy threw me out
of your song tonight.

582
00:46:16,723 --> 00:46:19,954
I ain't gonna give him a chance
to throw me out of a window.

583
00:46:20,127 --> 00:46:25,030
Let's get a bowl of chop suey,
and we'll rewrite the show.

584
00:46:25,199 --> 00:46:28,635
If it'll write me back in the show,
I'd go for a bowl of anything.

585
00:46:28,802 --> 00:46:32,135
Well, you can get most anything
out of a bowl of chop suey.

586
00:46:32,306 --> 00:46:33,796
Oh, cutie!

587
00:46:34,241 --> 00:46:36,106
Come on, Queenie.

588
00:46:37,110 --> 00:46:38,600
You two run along.

589
00:46:38,779 --> 00:46:42,510
I've got some things to do,
and I'll join you later.

590
00:46:43,183 --> 00:46:45,344
Why, what's the matter?

591
00:46:45,519 --> 00:46:49,478
Well, I've...
I've got an awful headache.

592
00:46:49,656 --> 00:46:52,591
I'm sorry, honey.
We'll go straight home if you'd rather.

593
00:46:52,759 --> 00:46:56,695
Oh, no, Hank. You two run along.
You'll have a lot of fun, anyway.

594
00:46:57,030 --> 00:47:00,591
Come on, Queenie.
We don't wanna go without you.

595
00:47:00,767 --> 00:47:03,531
Get your hat. You'll feel better
when you get out of here.

596
00:47:03,704 --> 00:47:05,569
Oh, sure, honey, come on.

597
00:47:06,473 --> 00:47:08,566
I can't go.

598
00:47:08,742 --> 00:47:13,270
- You got a date with somebody, huh?
- Of course not.

599
00:47:13,447 --> 00:47:17,577
- Who, Queenie? You're crazy.
- Crazy, am I?

600
00:47:17,751 --> 00:47:20,686
You've got a date
with that Jock Warriner, I'll bet.

601
00:47:20,921 --> 00:47:24,288
- Well, and what if I have?
- Well, I don't like it.

602
00:47:24,458 --> 00:47:26,892
Oh, you can't go out with that bird.

603
00:47:27,060 --> 00:47:30,223
I'll have to show you
whether I can or not.

604
00:47:32,533 --> 00:47:34,228
Come in.

605
00:47:35,202 --> 00:47:36,999
- Hello.
- Oh, hello.

606
00:47:37,170 --> 00:47:40,731
Well, here I am again.
You can't get rid of me.

607
00:47:40,908 --> 00:47:43,775
- I'll be right with you, Mr. Warriner.
- All right.

608
00:47:49,149 --> 00:47:52,607
Maybe you had better wait for me
just a few minutes down on the stage.

609
00:47:52,786 --> 00:47:54,720
- Shall I wait at the stage door?
- Please.

610
00:47:54,888 --> 00:47:56,583
- Now, don't be long.
- No, I won't.

611
00:47:56,757 --> 00:47:58,622
- Hurry.
- I will.

612
00:48:06,900 --> 00:48:09,494
Now, Queenie, don't act this way.

613
00:48:09,670 --> 00:48:12,867
He ain't the right kind of a guy
for you to go out with.

614
00:48:13,040 --> 00:48:15,941
What difference does it make
what kind of a guy he is?

615
00:48:16,109 --> 00:48:20,569
I'm going out with him because I...
Well, because I want to.

616
00:48:20,747 --> 00:48:23,272
- Oh, no, you're not.
- Oh, yes, I am.

617
00:48:23,450 --> 00:48:25,441
You're not! You're gonna listen to me.

618
00:48:25,619 --> 00:48:29,453
I can take care of myself. And you
can both mind your own business.

619
00:48:35,596 --> 00:48:38,588
Why don't you mind your sister?
She knows best.

620
00:48:38,765 --> 00:48:40,164
You keep out of this.

621
00:48:40,334 --> 00:48:43,599
I've got my own life to live,
and I'm gonna live it.

622
00:48:45,739 --> 00:48:50,438
I'm not gonna be the third wheel
to anybody's bicycle!

623
00:48:51,545 --> 00:48:53,274
Oh, Queenie!

624
00:48:56,083 --> 00:48:58,142
Oh, Eddie, what'll we do?

625
00:48:58,318 --> 00:49:00,946
Why, she's never gone
against my advice before.

626
00:49:01,121 --> 00:49:04,420
Don't worry, Hank. She's only a kid.
She'll snap out of it.

627
00:49:04,591 --> 00:49:07,560
I guess the bright lights
got under her skin.

628
00:49:07,728 --> 00:49:10,424
Come on, let's go
and get a bowl of chili.

629
00:49:31,251 --> 00:49:32,741
Queenie!

630
00:49:35,522 --> 00:49:39,652
- Oh, you didn't go. You didn't go!
- I couldn't, Hank.

631
00:49:39,826 --> 00:49:43,023
Oh, dear! I'm so glad.

632
00:49:56,943 --> 00:49:59,070
Oh, they're elegant.

633
00:49:59,245 --> 00:50:02,976
- Yeah. Where do I park them?
- Wait a minute. Put them over there.

634
00:50:36,282 --> 00:50:38,307
Good morning, beautiful lady.

635
00:50:38,484 --> 00:50:40,748
Oh, you frightened me.

636
00:50:40,920 --> 00:50:42,683
Good morning.

637
00:50:44,357 --> 00:50:48,521
- Oh, they're elegant. Thanks.
- Just a little birthday card.

638
00:50:48,695 --> 00:50:53,189
Yes, well, they're lovely.
You'll excuse me now?

639
00:50:57,203 --> 00:50:59,933
You have some place to go, haven't you?

640
00:51:00,440 --> 00:51:02,203
Are you putting me out?

641
00:51:02,375 --> 00:51:05,538
What's the matter?
Don't you like the flowers?

642
00:51:05,712 --> 00:51:10,809
- Oh, they're beautiful.
- They're not half so beautiful as you.

643
00:51:11,417 --> 00:51:14,250
Any girl that can look beautiful
so early in the morning...

644
00:51:14,420 --> 00:51:16,547
That sounds like you know
a lot about girls.

645
00:51:16,723 --> 00:51:18,418
I do. I'm an expert.

646
00:51:18,591 --> 00:51:21,025
- Much obliged for the compliment.
- You're welcome.

647
00:51:21,194 --> 00:51:22,627
Well, so long.

648
00:51:22,795 --> 00:51:25,593
- Must I go?
- Please do.

649
00:51:25,765 --> 00:51:30,725
- And thank you for being so nice to me.
- Not half so nice as I'd like to be.

650
00:51:30,903 --> 00:51:34,361
I'm arranging a little party tonight
for your birthday.

651
00:51:34,540 --> 00:51:36,167
- A party for me?
- Yes.

652
00:51:36,342 --> 00:51:38,003
Come in.
But you mustn't do that.

653
00:51:38,177 --> 00:51:40,270
- But why not?
- Because I don't want you to.

654
00:51:40,446 --> 00:51:42,880
That's silly. Everything's arranged.
You must come.

655
00:51:43,049 --> 00:51:45,074
Please don't.
Hello, Eddie.

656
00:51:45,251 --> 00:51:47,082
- Hello, Queenie.
- Oh, hello.

657
00:51:47,253 --> 00:51:50,620
- How are you? Where's Hank?
- She's out.

658
00:51:50,790 --> 00:51:53,850
Then I'm gonna wait right here
till she gets back.

659
00:51:57,597 --> 00:52:00,498
Well, it looks as if I'd better
take the air.

660
00:52:01,367 --> 00:52:03,631
I'll give you a ring a little later,
shall I?

661
00:52:03,803 --> 00:52:05,100
Fine.

662
00:52:16,449 --> 00:52:18,917
- Goodbye.
- Goodbye.

663
00:52:22,055 --> 00:52:25,115
And thank you again for the flowers.

664
00:52:25,725 --> 00:52:30,560
Well, I've got my suspicions about
any guy that kisses a girl's hand.

665
00:52:31,197 --> 00:52:35,099
- What do you mean?
- He'll give you a ring later.

666
00:52:35,268 --> 00:52:39,102
He'll give you a ring.
On the telephone, but not here.

667
00:52:39,272 --> 00:52:40,830
What are you burned up about?

668
00:52:41,007 --> 00:52:43,498
- He hasn't done anything to you.
- No.

669
00:52:43,676 --> 00:52:47,737
- And what's more, he ain't going to.
- Sit down and cool off.

670
00:52:47,914 --> 00:52:51,350
Hank'll be here in a minute,
and you can start raving to her.

671
00:52:53,352 --> 00:52:57,345
Oh, Eddie, don't be such a crab.

672
00:53:12,605 --> 00:53:16,097
Why do you let a guy like that
hang around you?

673
00:53:16,275 --> 00:53:20,974
Say, will you lay off him? I'm sick
of hearing you crab all the time.

674
00:53:22,582 --> 00:53:26,313
- I'll give him a sock in the nose.
- You and how many others?

675
00:53:26,486 --> 00:53:29,182
I don't need any others.
I can do it all by myself.

676
00:53:29,355 --> 00:53:31,380
What do you think of that?

677
00:53:32,458 --> 00:53:36,451
I know. But you haven't anything
to do in the show.

678
00:53:36,629 --> 00:53:41,157
I can team you up with this blond
and still book you as the Mahoney Sisters.

679
00:53:41,334 --> 00:53:44,462
Nope. I've gotta stick around
and keep an eye on Queenie.

680
00:53:44,637 --> 00:53:47,128
Queenie? What has she been doing?

681
00:53:47,306 --> 00:53:51,037
She's changed, Uncle Jed.
She don't tell me things anymore.

682
00:53:51,210 --> 00:53:54,202
Night after night,
she's out with Jock Warriner.

683
00:53:54,380 --> 00:53:58,749
If it wasn't for Queenie,
I'd be the happiest girl in the world.

684
00:53:58,918 --> 00:54:00,647
With Eddie?

685
00:54:04,390 --> 00:54:06,483
Now, now listen, Hank.

686
00:54:06,659 --> 00:54:10,686
Why don't you give Eddie a break
and marry him?

687
00:54:10,863 --> 00:54:13,764
- Maybe I will.
- Maybe.

688
00:54:13,933 --> 00:54:16,766
Maybe that's just what Queenie needs:

689
00:54:16,936 --> 00:54:20,599
- To see you and Eddie happy.
- Do you think so?

690
00:54:20,773 --> 00:54:25,267
It's exactly what
I've been trying to... Sure!

691
00:54:28,247 --> 00:54:32,081
Queenie, I didn't mean to get
all burned up about Jock Warriner.

692
00:54:39,292 --> 00:54:44,025
Queenie, I couldn't sleep
at all last night, thinking of you.

693
00:54:45,131 --> 00:54:46,860
On the level.

694
00:56:12,718 --> 00:56:13,980
Queenie.

695
00:56:16,722 --> 00:56:19,156
I wrote it for you.

696
00:56:23,329 --> 00:56:26,389
I wrote it about you.

697
00:56:27,600 --> 00:56:31,400
It's you. Don't you know what I mean?

698
00:56:31,570 --> 00:56:33,094
No, no. Hank.

699
00:56:33,272 --> 00:56:35,206
Aw, Queenie, l...

700
00:56:36,876 --> 00:56:40,039
You keep your thoughts to yourself
about Jock. I like him.

701
00:56:40,212 --> 00:56:42,146
Queenie, don't be so mean to Eddie.

702
00:56:42,315 --> 00:56:44,510
You two both better lay off me
from now on.

703
00:56:44,684 --> 00:56:47,278
I'm darn sick of being nagged.

704
00:56:53,159 --> 00:56:57,220
She's just the same with me, Eddie,
every time I mention his name.

705
00:56:57,396 --> 00:56:58,988
But look it.

706
00:57:02,835 --> 00:57:05,861
"Happy birthday, Queenie."
That's great, Hank.

707
00:57:06,038 --> 00:57:08,871
And wait till you see
what's coming up.

708
00:57:10,609 --> 00:57:13,772
It's my old ring.
I had it reset for her.

709
00:57:13,946 --> 00:57:18,007
She's always wanted a diamond,
and it's real platinum too.

710
00:57:18,184 --> 00:57:21,347
- That's pretty, Hank.
- I've invited the whole gang tonight.

711
00:57:21,520 --> 00:57:23,715
There's Uncle Jed
and the stage manager...

712
00:57:23,889 --> 00:57:26,449
...and Faye Fanchett
and the Flying Fools.

713
00:57:26,625 --> 00:57:30,152
I'm gonna give her
the swellest party she ever had.

714
00:57:30,529 --> 00:57:31,860
Oh, Eddie, I love her so.

715
00:57:35,267 --> 00:57:38,236
You sure are regular, Hank.

716
00:57:39,839 --> 00:57:41,500
Jock Warriner.

717
00:57:45,444 --> 00:57:48,106
I wanna talk to her alone, Eddie.

718
00:57:48,280 --> 00:57:50,714
I'll see you later
at the theater tonight.

719
00:57:50,883 --> 00:57:52,350
All right, Hank.

720
00:57:57,289 --> 00:57:58,813
Goodbye, Hank.

721
00:58:11,804 --> 00:58:13,465
Oh, Queenie.

722
00:58:22,615 --> 00:58:24,981
- You see, it's very simple.
- Rolling his own.

723
00:58:25,151 --> 00:58:28,143
That's it.
Now, watch this one.

724
00:58:36,729 --> 00:58:39,960
Boy, if you could do that
with my wife.

725
00:58:40,199 --> 00:58:43,134
Say, give us something good,
something new.

726
00:58:43,302 --> 00:58:46,430
Say, can you pull a rabbit from that?

727
00:58:50,609 --> 00:58:52,270
Hello, everybody.

728
00:58:54,313 --> 00:58:57,476
- I brought the radio with me.
- Joe, what have you got there?

729
00:58:57,650 --> 00:59:00,983
- Gee, I can get Chicago with that.
- Chicago? Why, that's nothing.

730
00:59:01,153 --> 00:59:04,554
- I got Scotland last night.
- How do you know you got Scotland?

731
00:59:04,723 --> 00:59:09,217
Why, I heard the guy singing
"The Best Things in Life Are Free."

732
00:59:13,399 --> 00:59:17,267
Take this cake in the other room,
and when you hear us yell "surprise"...

733
00:59:17,436 --> 00:59:20,166
...bring it back lighted.
Now, don't forget.

734
00:59:20,339 --> 00:59:24,275
Hey, give me a few of those things.
Give me a few of them.

735
00:59:25,978 --> 00:59:28,503
Someone's coming. Are you all set?

736
00:59:28,681 --> 00:59:30,512
Quiet, quiet.

737
00:59:31,917 --> 00:59:33,680
Surprise!

738
00:59:33,853 --> 00:59:36,413
Surprise! Surprise!

739
00:59:39,325 --> 00:59:42,351
- Well, where's Queenie?
- Yeah, where's Queenie?

740
00:59:42,528 --> 00:59:46,988
Why, there was another party,
and I forgot to tell her about this one.

741
00:59:47,166 --> 00:59:50,533
I thought she'd have more fun there.
I'm sorry.

742
00:59:54,740 --> 00:59:56,264
Jock Warriner, huh.

743
00:59:56,442 --> 00:59:58,740
Say, listen, I've got an idea.

744
00:59:58,911 --> 01:00:00,503
Let's give the party...

745
01:00:00,679 --> 01:00:03,113
Let's give the party...

746
01:00:03,382 --> 01:00:05,646
- For Hank.
- Great!

747
01:00:08,087 --> 01:00:10,555
Wait a minute, folks.
Just a second.

748
01:00:10,723 --> 01:00:13,783
Take all the things down to my room.
We'll hold our party there.

749
01:00:13,959 --> 01:00:15,449
Hank doesn't feel very well.

750
01:00:19,698 --> 01:00:22,360
Well, all right,
we'll go down to your room.

751
01:00:26,005 --> 01:00:28,200
Good night. I hope you feel better.

752
01:00:28,374 --> 01:00:30,638
Look, Hank, I'm awfully sorry.

753
01:00:31,510 --> 01:00:35,173
- I'm sorry, Hank.
- I left a present for you.

754
01:00:35,347 --> 01:00:39,147
- I hope you're feeling better, Hank.
- We'll see you tomorrow.

755
01:00:39,318 --> 01:00:42,014
You see what you're missing?

756
01:00:43,255 --> 01:00:47,248
Why don't you have a little drink?
It might buck you up.

757
01:00:50,563 --> 01:00:53,031
- Good night, Hankie.
- Good night, Uncle Jed.

758
01:00:53,198 --> 01:00:54,460
Good night, dear.

759
01:01:13,419 --> 01:01:16,183
Hey, Eddie.
Ain't you coming down?

760
01:01:16,355 --> 01:01:20,189
You run along, Jed.
I've got to tell Hank something.

761
01:01:20,359 --> 01:01:22,384
- I'll see you in a little while.
- Sure.

762
01:01:22,561 --> 01:01:27,021
But don't make it too long. You know
that bottle won't last very long.

763
01:01:36,408 --> 01:01:39,343
Queenie and me have always been
on the level.

764
01:01:39,511 --> 01:01:41,706
And now I'm fronting for her.

765
01:01:41,880 --> 01:01:46,442
Won't you please give her
all the best of the breaks?

766
01:01:48,787 --> 01:01:50,948
What's the matter, Hank?

767
01:01:56,195 --> 01:01:58,220
I lost something.

768
01:02:04,703 --> 01:02:08,161
Oh, Eddie.
At least I've still got you.

769
01:02:08,340 --> 01:02:10,365
That's one break.

770
01:02:20,552 --> 01:02:22,417
Goodbye, baby.

771
01:02:40,139 --> 01:02:42,437
Happy birthday.

772
01:03:28,487 --> 01:03:31,479
Queenie, aren't you
having a good time?

773
01:03:31,657 --> 01:03:34,057
I'm having a marvelous time,
Mr. Warriner.

774
01:03:34,226 --> 01:03:36,956
Now don't call me Mr. Warriner.

775
01:03:37,129 --> 01:03:40,565
Call me Jock, won't you?

776
01:03:40,733 --> 01:03:42,496
All right.

777
01:03:45,337 --> 01:03:47,669
Mr. Warriner.

778
01:05:56,435 --> 01:06:00,201
- Wait a minute, everybody. Queenie.
- Oh, I can't.

779
01:06:00,372 --> 01:06:03,899
I want you to stand up here
where everyone can see you.

780
01:06:04,910 --> 01:06:07,606
- A toast!
- A toast to Queenie!

781
01:06:07,779 --> 01:06:11,340
A happy birthday to Queenie,
the queen of New York's beautiful girls.

782
01:06:11,516 --> 01:06:15,282
- Many happy returns!
- Happy birthday!

783
01:06:17,823 --> 01:06:22,920
I can't say anything
but thanks, everybody. A lot.

784
01:06:23,095 --> 01:06:26,394
Oh, it's a lovely surprise... Jock.

785
01:06:26,565 --> 01:06:30,001
Oh, it's nothing at all.
Will you dance now?

786
01:06:53,292 --> 01:06:56,159
That cake is just elegant...

787
01:06:56,328 --> 01:06:58,353
...but I can't eat it all.

788
01:06:58,530 --> 01:07:02,489
Well, you eat as much as you can,
and we'll save the rest.

789
01:07:10,809 --> 01:07:13,471
Please, Mr. Warriner,
ask them to play something else.

790
01:07:13,645 --> 01:07:17,274
- I hate sentimental music.
- All right.

791
01:07:18,150 --> 01:07:20,118
"Broadway Melody."

792
01:07:21,653 --> 01:07:25,089
Don't wear a frown on old Broadway.

793
01:07:28,360 --> 01:07:29,827
Tell me...

794
01:07:29,995 --> 01:07:32,589
...why don't you like that song?

795
01:07:32,764 --> 01:07:34,994
I don't know.

796
01:07:35,801 --> 01:07:37,962
Well, what do you like?

797
01:07:38,203 --> 01:07:40,637
I like cake.

798
01:07:42,074 --> 01:07:45,475
Won't you tell me that you like me a little?

799
01:07:46,044 --> 01:07:47,602
Maybe.

800
01:07:49,314 --> 01:07:50,975
You mean it?

801
01:07:51,550 --> 01:07:53,177
Maybe.

802
01:07:54,019 --> 01:07:57,785
Will you tell me why you're so nice to me?

803
01:07:57,956 --> 01:07:59,583
Maybe.

804
01:08:01,226 --> 01:08:03,353
Please, I wanna dance.

805
01:08:03,528 --> 01:08:06,019
Oh, no, come on.
Let's sit this one out.

806
01:08:06,198 --> 01:08:11,295
But look, everybody's dancing,
and the music is playing and everything.

807
01:08:18,610 --> 01:08:21,841
Mr. Warriner.
You don't mean this for me?

808
01:08:22,014 --> 01:08:23,845
Why, of course.

809
01:08:24,016 --> 01:08:27,247
Diamonds should only
be worn by beautiful girls.

810
01:08:27,419 --> 01:08:29,649
Oh, it's just adorable.

811
01:08:29,821 --> 01:08:32,756
I'd like to do a lot of things
for you, Queenie.

812
01:08:33,058 --> 01:08:35,583
How would you like
an apartment all your own?

813
01:08:35,761 --> 01:08:37,888
Say, on Park Avenue.

814
01:08:38,063 --> 01:08:40,531
And a car all your own.

815
01:08:40,699 --> 01:08:45,261
Perhaps a Rolls-Royce.
Oh, and a lot of nice things.

816
01:08:46,838 --> 01:08:50,137
Well, I'd have to think about that.

817
01:08:50,642 --> 01:08:52,405
Say, where have you been?

818
01:08:52,577 --> 01:08:55,068
I've been looking
all over the place for you.

819
01:08:55,247 --> 01:08:57,511
You would come in at a time like this.

820
01:08:57,682 --> 01:09:00,674
Certainly. Come on, little love boat.

821
01:09:00,852 --> 01:09:03,218
Let's have this dance.

822
01:09:30,215 --> 01:09:32,979
- Were you asleep, Hank?
- No, honey.

823
01:09:33,151 --> 01:09:35,847
Well, that's swell,
because I wanna to tell you...

824
01:09:36,021 --> 01:09:39,320
...about the grandest party
that ever happened to me.

825
01:09:58,510 --> 01:10:03,914
Look at that. Look at that. Did you ever see
anything more beautiful in all your life?

826
01:10:04,349 --> 01:10:08,786
No, sirree. Because that's class, that is.

827
01:10:09,454 --> 01:10:12,548
And Eddie said he wouldn't
even give me a ring.

828
01:10:14,493 --> 01:10:17,189
What would I want with his ring?

829
01:10:18,563 --> 01:10:22,158
There's more diamonds in a bracelet,
ain't they? Ain't they?

830
01:10:23,235 --> 01:10:25,499
Honey, I don't know what
you're saying this for...

831
01:10:25,670 --> 01:10:29,504
...but I know you don't mean it.
You can't mean it.

832
01:10:29,674 --> 01:10:33,610
- It ain't in you to mean it.
- Sure I mean it.

833
01:10:34,880 --> 01:10:37,246
Why shouldn't I mean it?

834
01:10:38,583 --> 01:10:41,609
And that ain't all I'm gonna have, either.

835
01:10:42,854 --> 01:10:46,756
I'm gonna have a Rolls-Royce.

836
01:10:47,526 --> 01:10:51,860
And an apartment on Park Avenue.

837
01:10:53,298 --> 01:10:57,257
And everything that goes with it.
That's what I'm gonna have.

838
01:10:57,435 --> 01:10:59,903
Now, honey, listen to me.

839
01:11:00,605 --> 01:11:04,405
I know we ain't had the greatest break
in the world since we hit New York.

840
01:11:04,576 --> 01:11:06,908
But that's gonna change.

841
01:11:07,078 --> 01:11:09,012
That's got to.

842
01:11:09,414 --> 01:11:12,781
And you're gonna meet
somebody that's right.

843
01:11:12,951 --> 01:11:18,014
Somebody you can be proud of,
who'll just be crazy about you.

844
01:11:18,757 --> 01:11:21,817
Somebody who's really worthy of you.

845
01:11:23,228 --> 01:11:25,423
Somebody like Eddie.

846
01:11:26,531 --> 01:11:29,591
Yeah? Well, that's all right for you...

847
01:11:29,768 --> 01:11:32,202
...but I ain't craving any hall-rooms...

848
01:11:32,370 --> 01:11:35,271
...with some song-and-dance guy...

849
01:11:35,440 --> 01:11:38,238
...who expects me to cook
his meals over a gas-jet...

850
01:11:38,410 --> 01:11:43,404
...listen to a lot of smart
wisecracks and bum songs.

851
01:11:43,782 --> 01:11:47,240
- No, sir.
- Oh, Queenie.

852
01:12:08,807 --> 01:12:11,298
Move over.

853
01:12:23,955 --> 01:12:27,186
No more of these
kind of dumps for mine.

854
01:12:27,492 --> 01:12:31,724
I'm gonna have everything
in the world I want.

855
01:12:31,896 --> 01:12:34,023
That's me.

856
01:12:34,532 --> 01:12:38,798
And you're gonna have Eddie.

857
01:18:28,219 --> 01:18:30,744
Queenie, I don't want you
to answer me like that again.

858
01:18:30,922 --> 01:18:34,517
- Then keep your nose out of my business.
- Well, your business is my business.

859
01:18:34,692 --> 01:18:36,683
That package is from Warriner, ain't it?

860
01:18:36,861 --> 01:18:40,297
- What if it is?
- I won't let you keep it, that's all.

861
01:18:40,865 --> 01:18:42,765
How are you gonna stop me?

862
01:18:42,934 --> 01:18:47,098
Oh, Queenie, don't you see what
I'm doing is for your own good?

863
01:18:47,271 --> 01:18:49,933
And don't you see
what I'm doing is for your...

864
01:18:51,576 --> 01:18:54,807
Oh, what are you talking about?
Now you listen to me.

865
01:18:54,979 --> 01:18:57,140
You're not gonna go out
with that guy, hear me?

866
01:18:57,315 --> 01:19:00,079
I'll stop you if I have to
tie you up to do it. You hear me?

867
01:19:00,251 --> 01:19:03,311
Cut it out. Be quiet.
They can hear you out front.

868
01:19:03,488 --> 01:19:06,013
Well, you hear me. I'm
going out with whoever I want...

869
01:19:06,190 --> 01:19:08,351
...and I won't hear orders
from anyone about it.

870
01:19:08,526 --> 01:19:11,154
- Now get that and get it straight.
- Queenie!

871
01:19:11,963 --> 01:19:15,399
You ain't my boss. So mind your
own business and shut up.

872
01:19:15,566 --> 01:19:18,000
Oh, Queenie.

873
01:19:18,870 --> 01:19:21,168
I won't shut up.
And you're gonna listen to me.

874
01:19:21,339 --> 01:19:25,298
I won't listen to you any more than
I will to her. So you needn't get started.

875
01:19:25,476 --> 01:19:28,570
- Getting near you, Kearns.
- All right.

876
01:19:32,517 --> 01:19:35,111
Hank, you run along. I'll talk to her.

877
01:20:02,714 --> 01:20:06,013
Now, listen, Queenie. You're young yet,
and you don't know things.

878
01:20:06,184 --> 01:20:08,778
What Hank has been saying
to you is for your own good.

879
01:20:08,953 --> 01:20:12,389
Yeah, and I suppose what you're
saying is for my own good too.

880
01:20:12,557 --> 01:20:14,855
As far as that goes, yes, it is.

881
01:20:15,026 --> 01:20:19,759
Whether you believe me or not,
I'm saying this because l...

882
01:20:19,931 --> 01:20:23,367
- Hank finished that. Got nowhere with it.
- Well, I'm gonna get somewhere.

883
01:20:23,534 --> 01:20:26,970
And whether you like me or hate me,
you're gonna pay attention to me...

884
01:20:27,138 --> 01:20:29,436
...because I'm...
Well...

885
01:20:29,607 --> 01:20:32,735
Me and Hank won't let you
go out with that guy. He's no good.

886
01:20:32,910 --> 01:20:35,435
- He wants girls who...
- You never went out with girls...

887
01:20:35,613 --> 01:20:39,344
...like he does.
- Plenty, but none since I met you.

888
01:20:39,951 --> 01:20:41,714
You and Hank...

889
01:20:41,886 --> 01:20:45,413
Get me right, sweetie.
I'm being on the level with you.

890
01:20:45,590 --> 01:20:47,490
Here's your pants, sir.

891
01:20:52,997 --> 01:20:55,795
- Hurry up, Kearns.
- All right.

892
01:20:55,967 --> 01:20:59,528
Oh, can't I say nothing that will
make you see what I mean?

893
01:20:59,704 --> 01:21:03,105
You're wasting time talking against
Mr. Warriner, if that's what you mean.

894
01:21:03,274 --> 01:21:05,834
Mr. Warriner. Do you know
what they say about that guy?

895
01:21:06,010 --> 01:21:08,638
I don't care what they say.
They're jealous, that's all.

896
01:21:08,813 --> 01:21:10,838
- You and the rest.
- Me, jealous?

897
01:21:11,883 --> 01:21:13,350
What are you so interested for?

898
01:21:13,518 --> 01:21:16,453
What business is it of yours
where I go and who I go with?

899
01:21:16,621 --> 01:21:18,748
It's my business because...

900
01:21:18,923 --> 01:21:20,481
Well, because it is.

901
01:21:20,658 --> 01:21:23,058
Oh, you ought to know
why I'm doing this.

902
01:21:23,227 --> 01:21:26,253
- It's because l...
- No, no, Eddie. Don't say it.

903
01:21:26,430 --> 01:21:29,365
Oh, I gotta say it, Queenie.
I can't stop from saying it now.

904
01:21:29,534 --> 01:21:31,229
And you gotta hear it.

905
01:21:31,402 --> 01:21:33,302
I love you, Queenie.

906
01:21:33,471 --> 01:21:35,564
I love you, and you know it.

907
01:21:35,740 --> 01:21:38,106
I can't help it. I tried, but I can't.

908
01:21:38,276 --> 01:21:40,210
But it's easy to say now.

909
01:21:40,378 --> 01:21:42,505
I love you, dear.

910
01:21:42,680 --> 01:21:45,513
And I love you, Eddie. Never forget it.

911
01:21:45,683 --> 01:21:48,584
- No matter what happens.
- Do you, Queenie?

912
01:21:48,753 --> 01:21:50,584
Yes, Eddie.

913
01:21:51,989 --> 01:21:54,253
And that's why we can't...

914
01:21:55,092 --> 01:21:56,992
Oh, don't you see now why...

915
01:21:57,161 --> 01:21:58,856
Why what?

916
01:21:59,564 --> 01:22:02,226
- I'm going out with Jock Warriner...
- No, you're not.

917
01:22:02,400 --> 01:22:05,164
Don't try to stop me, Eddie.
It's the best way.

918
01:22:05,336 --> 01:22:06,564
Here's your coat, sir.

919
01:22:06,737 --> 01:22:09,797
- Lf you go out with that guy, I'll...
- There's a stage wait, Kearns.

920
01:22:09,974 --> 01:22:11,942
Let it wait.
Queenie, I gotta go on now.

921
01:22:12,109 --> 01:22:15,601
- Promise me you won't go out with him.
- Are you trying to ruin the show?

922
01:22:15,780 --> 01:22:18,271
- Promise me, Queenie.
- Oh, I can't promise.

923
01:22:18,449 --> 01:22:20,440
- Then you won't?
- Well, then I won't.

924
01:22:20,618 --> 01:22:24,384
I'll murder that guy. I'll tear him apart.
Go on out with him. Go ahead.

925
01:22:24,555 --> 01:22:26,113
Get on there, Kearns.

926
01:22:26,290 --> 01:22:29,885
Queenie, you better
be here when I get off.

927
01:22:34,332 --> 01:22:37,096
- Get up to your dressing room.
- All right.

928
01:22:56,787 --> 01:22:59,187
Oh, Queenie. You ain't got
no idea what you're doing.

929
01:22:59,357 --> 01:23:02,793
Oh, yes, I have. Can't I have a little fun
without you trying to stop me?

930
01:23:02,960 --> 01:23:05,394
Oh, I ain't trying
to stop you having fun...

931
01:23:05,563 --> 01:23:07,554
...but this thing will turn out bad.

932
01:23:07,732 --> 01:23:11,759
That guy don't mean to marry you.
His kind don't never marry.

933
01:23:11,936 --> 01:23:14,598
He ain't the type to take
a girl out and buy her drinks...

934
01:23:14,772 --> 01:23:19,903
...and let it go at that. You know that.
And you know what the finish will be.

935
01:23:20,511 --> 01:23:23,275
Now listen to me, Hank.
Get this straight, once and for all.

936
01:23:23,447 --> 01:23:25,711
I'm old enough to know
what I'm gonna do.

937
01:23:25,883 --> 01:23:29,649
And I don't want no more cracks from you
and Mr. Wise-Guy Kearns about it either.

938
01:23:29,820 --> 01:23:31,720
You can go your way, and I'll go mine.

939
01:23:31,889 --> 01:23:33,754
What I'm saying's for your own good.

940
01:23:33,925 --> 01:23:38,055
- Tell it to somebody you don't know.
- I ain't gonna let you get away with it.

941
01:23:38,229 --> 01:23:40,322
- Give me that. That's mine.
- It's not yours...

942
01:23:40,498 --> 01:23:43,763
- Well, it is mine, and you will give it...
- No, I won't.

943
01:23:44,101 --> 01:23:46,626
You will give it to me.

944
01:23:48,139 --> 01:23:49,868
Queenie.

945
01:23:51,042 --> 01:23:53,340
Queenie, you mustn't go.
Queenie, you can't go.

946
01:23:53,511 --> 01:23:55,308
Eddie, stop her.
Do something, will you?

947
01:23:55,479 --> 01:23:59,540
- Queenie, just a moment, Queenie.
- Get your hands off me.

948
01:24:00,117 --> 01:24:02,244
You're not gonna leave
except with me and Hank.

949
01:24:02,420 --> 01:24:04,911
- You get out of my way.
- You heard what I said.

950
01:24:05,089 --> 01:24:08,422
You can't get away with it.
I'll kill that guy just as sure as anything.

951
01:24:08,592 --> 01:24:10,924
I'll make him suffer the way
he's making me suffer.

952
01:24:11,095 --> 01:24:12,562
Shut up!

953
01:24:13,130 --> 01:24:15,098
- I'm going.
- You can't go, Queenie.

954
01:24:15,266 --> 01:24:16,961
Gonna stay right here. No.

955
01:24:17,134 --> 01:24:19,193
Let go of me.

956
01:24:19,370 --> 01:24:22,567
I've heard all I'm gonna hear from
either of you. You've said enough.

957
01:24:22,740 --> 01:24:24,731
- I'd like to see you kill anybody.
- Queenie.

958
01:24:24,909 --> 01:24:27,002
You dirty, cheap little songwriter, you.

959
01:24:27,178 --> 01:24:29,669
I hate you, I hate you, I hate you!

960
01:24:29,847 --> 01:24:32,611
Queenie, Queenie!

961
01:25:37,014 --> 01:25:40,108
- Say, what kind of a sap are you, anyway?
- What do you mean?

962
01:25:40,284 --> 01:25:44,721
You gonna let a john like that steal her from
you because he's got a little more jack?

963
01:25:45,589 --> 01:25:49,252
Well, if you do, all I can say
is you're a rotten quitter.

964
01:25:49,827 --> 01:25:52,125
You love her, don't you?

965
01:25:52,563 --> 01:25:54,758
Oh, don't lie to me. I know you do.

966
01:25:54,932 --> 01:25:57,093
Say, if I loved a girl
like you do Queenie...

967
01:25:57,268 --> 01:26:00,533
...l'd fight for her. What's the
matter with you? Where's your nerve?

968
01:26:00,704 --> 01:26:04,105
- But, Hank, you don't...
- Oh, don't pass the buck to me.

969
01:26:10,514 --> 01:26:14,416
What do you think I've been meaning all
along? I was on the level with this thing?

970
01:26:14,585 --> 01:26:17,986
That I was in love with you?
That's a hot one.

971
01:26:18,155 --> 01:26:21,249
I just been playing you for all
I could get out of you for the act.

972
01:26:21,425 --> 01:26:24,917
- You been kidding me all the time?
- Sure, I been kidding you.

973
01:26:25,096 --> 01:26:28,554
Say, I wouldn't marry you
if you was the last man on earth.

974
01:26:29,166 --> 01:26:31,930
And at that, I ain't so sure
you're the right guy for her.

975
01:26:32,103 --> 01:26:34,037
You're a coward.

976
01:26:34,205 --> 01:26:37,402
You're afraid of Jock Warriner,
or you'd go out and fight for her.

977
01:26:37,575 --> 01:26:39,702
- But you're just yellow.
- You think I'm yellow?

978
01:26:39,877 --> 01:26:42,675
- Sure, you're yellow.
- I'll show you how much I'm yellow.

979
01:26:42,847 --> 01:26:44,815
You're yellow. You hear me?
You're yellow.

980
01:26:44,982 --> 01:26:47,246
- I'm yellow?
- Yes, you are. You're yellow!

981
01:26:47,418 --> 01:26:49,818
You're yellow. Do you hear me?

982
01:26:56,060 --> 01:27:00,224
Oh, Eddie, you're not yellow.

983
01:27:00,731 --> 01:27:02,562
You're white.

984
01:28:17,775 --> 01:28:21,871
Murray Hill-8400. Yes, please.

985
01:28:28,719 --> 01:28:29,981
Hello.

986
01:28:31,155 --> 01:28:34,181
Hello, Uncle Jed?

987
01:28:34,358 --> 01:28:36,155
It's Hank.

988
01:28:36,393 --> 01:28:39,954
Say, I've decided
to take those 30 weeks.

989
01:28:40,130 --> 01:28:43,099
You can team me up with that blond.

990
01:29:15,866 --> 01:29:18,426
I'm breathless.

991
01:29:18,602 --> 01:29:22,094
Oh, I don't know what to say.
It's wonderful.

992
01:29:22,273 --> 01:29:24,241
Oh, I can't thank you enough.

993
01:29:24,408 --> 01:29:26,501
It's not half good enough for you.

994
01:29:26,677 --> 01:29:29,510
I want you to have
everything in the world.

995
01:29:29,680 --> 01:29:31,375
Thank you.

996
01:30:02,579 --> 01:30:04,274
- Hello, Eddie.
- Where's Queenie?

997
01:30:04,448 --> 01:30:07,212
I want you to meet my girlfriend.

998
01:30:10,254 --> 01:30:14,918
- Come on, let's go back to the party.
- Oh, Queenie, not yet.

999
01:30:15,192 --> 01:30:18,821
Why, I haven't had you
to myself for a moment tonight.

1000
01:30:19,630 --> 01:30:21,860
Oh, but I'd rather go back, please.

1001
01:30:22,032 --> 01:30:23,863
Wait, Queenie.

1002
01:30:25,102 --> 01:30:29,038
I have so many things
I want to tell you alone.

1003
01:30:30,341 --> 01:30:33,003
Oh, well, you can tell me out there.

1004
01:30:34,578 --> 01:30:36,671
Wait a minute, Queenie.

1005
01:30:36,847 --> 01:30:40,283
I've done all these things for you.
Aren't you going to be nice to me?

1006
01:30:40,451 --> 01:30:43,011
- Oh, Jock, let me go.
- Why should I let you go?

1007
01:30:43,187 --> 01:30:45,747
- Please let me go, please.
- No, I won't let you go.

1008
01:30:45,923 --> 01:30:47,891
You're going to stay right here with me.

1009
01:30:48,058 --> 01:30:50,549
- No, I'm not gonna stay here with you.
- Yes, you are.

1010
01:30:50,728 --> 01:30:52,559
- No, I'm not.
- I will keep you here.

1011
01:30:52,730 --> 01:30:55,392
You won't keep me here,
do you hear me? You won't.

1012
01:30:55,566 --> 01:30:57,431
- Let me go.
- I won't let you go.

1013
01:30:57,601 --> 01:30:59,466
I won't stay with you another minute.

1014
01:30:59,636 --> 01:31:02,070
- Let me go.
- I told you not to come here.

1015
01:31:02,239 --> 01:31:04,264
- Why did you come?
- Oh, Eddie, take me away.

1016
01:31:04,441 --> 01:31:06,341
What do you mean
coming in here? Get out.

1017
01:31:06,510 --> 01:31:09,707
- I won't before I'm finished with you.
- Oh, Eddie, let's go.

1018
01:31:09,880 --> 01:31:12,542
- I've been looking for you.
- Now that you've found me...

1019
01:31:12,716 --> 01:31:15,810
...what do you want?
- I'll show you what I want.

1020
01:31:18,822 --> 01:31:20,221
Oh, Eddie.

1021
01:31:20,391 --> 01:31:22,086
What's the matter?

1022
01:31:22,259 --> 01:31:24,227
Oh, darling, let me see you.

1023
01:31:24,395 --> 01:31:27,262
Oh, Eddie. Have they
hurt you, sweetheart?

1024
01:31:27,431 --> 01:31:29,023
Have they?

1025
01:31:29,633 --> 01:31:32,864
You just hit him again if you dare.
Just try it, that's all.

1026
01:31:33,036 --> 01:31:37,097
- Eddie, let me see you.
- Queenie, Queenie.

1027
01:31:37,875 --> 01:31:39,706
You don't realize what you're doing.

1028
01:31:39,877 --> 01:31:43,313
You let me go. And you can take
your jewelry and your presents...

1029
01:31:43,480 --> 01:31:46,415
...and everything. I don't want
anything to do with you.

1030
01:31:46,583 --> 01:31:48,107
Let me get a sock at that guy.

1031
01:31:48,285 --> 01:31:51,254
- No, Eddie don't...
- Let me get at him, just let me get at him.

1032
01:31:51,422 --> 01:31:53,788
- I wanna get at that guy.
- Throw him out.

1033
01:31:53,957 --> 01:31:56,289
- Out he goes.
- No, don't.

1034
01:31:57,594 --> 01:31:59,687
Don't let them. They're going to kill him.

1035
01:31:59,863 --> 01:32:02,127
Oh, Eddie. Don't you do that to him.

1036
01:32:03,233 --> 01:32:05,098
And stay out.

1037
01:32:05,269 --> 01:32:06,861
What do you know about that guy?

1038
01:32:07,037 --> 01:32:08,698
Got rid of that guy anyhow.

1039
01:32:08,872 --> 01:32:11,204
Oh, Eddie. Eddie, dear.

1040
01:32:11,375 --> 01:32:13,240
You dirty bums, you.

1041
01:32:13,410 --> 01:32:16,140
- Oh, Eddie, have they hurt you?
- What do you think?

1042
01:32:16,313 --> 01:32:18,873
- Oh, I'm sorry.
- I'll bet you are.

1043
01:32:19,049 --> 01:32:20,448
I am.

1044
01:32:20,617 --> 01:32:23,313
I don't know why you feel
sorry for anybody like me.

1045
01:32:23,487 --> 01:32:25,079
I'm no good.

1046
01:32:25,255 --> 01:32:27,052
I can't even scrap a little.

1047
01:32:27,224 --> 01:32:31,217
I let a heel like that take a sock
at me and get away with it.

1048
01:32:31,395 --> 01:32:33,625
Well, Eddie, he's bigger than you are.

1049
01:32:33,797 --> 01:32:37,324
- Yeah, a little bigger.
- And he's awfully strong.

1050
01:32:37,501 --> 01:32:39,935
I suppose you found
that out from his hugs.

1051
01:32:40,103 --> 01:32:42,663
Well, if you couldn't stop
them from throwing you out...

1052
01:32:42,840 --> 01:32:45,206
...how could I stop him from hugging me?

1053
01:32:45,375 --> 01:32:48,538
Well, there's something in that.
I guess you'd better go home.

1054
01:32:48,712 --> 01:32:51,203
Oh, Eddie, aren't you
gonna take me home?

1055
01:32:51,381 --> 01:32:54,976
- I'll take you home.
- Don't you like me anymore?

1056
01:32:55,152 --> 01:32:58,883
Like you? Why, Queenie, l...

1057
01:32:59,056 --> 01:33:01,422
Oh, what is it? They've
hurt you, I know they have.

1058
01:33:01,592 --> 01:33:03,822
Oh, I'm all right, Queenie.
Come on, let's go.

1059
01:33:03,994 --> 01:33:06,792
Now understand, it took
six of them to throw me out.

1060
01:33:06,964 --> 01:33:08,955
Yes, Eddie.

1061
01:33:09,600 --> 01:33:11,295
Oh, what is it?

1062
01:33:18,475 --> 01:33:20,602
Oh, they'll be here any minute.

1063
01:33:20,777 --> 01:33:24,269
What does it...? What does it...?
Read it.

1064
01:33:24,448 --> 01:33:27,508
"Arriving 2:30, wonderful honeymoon.
See you the minute we get in.

1065
01:33:27,684 --> 01:33:32,747
Love to our Hank, Queenie and Eddie."
Oh, I'm so excited. What time is it?

1066
01:33:34,725 --> 01:33:36,784
- 12:00 last night.
- It's what?

1067
01:33:36,960 --> 01:33:38,985
Well, what's the matter with this thing?

1068
01:33:39,162 --> 01:33:40,390
See who that is.

1069
01:33:43,433 --> 01:33:45,560
- Hello, Jed.
- Hank!

1070
01:33:51,308 --> 01:33:53,435
Oh, gee.

1071
01:33:55,846 --> 01:33:58,679
- Hello, Eddie.
- Hello, Hank.

1072
01:33:58,849 --> 01:34:01,113
Oh, come here.

1073
01:34:01,285 --> 01:34:04,721
Well, well, Queenie. Congratu...

1074
01:34:04,888 --> 01:34:07,652
- How are you?
- Oh, fine, Uncle Jed. How are you?

1075
01:34:07,824 --> 01:34:11,555
Oh, I'm great. What's it going to be
in the electric lights this time?

1076
01:34:11,728 --> 01:34:14,162
Queenie Kearns and Company?

1077
01:34:14,331 --> 01:34:16,060
No, sirree.

1078
01:34:16,233 --> 01:34:20,465
I'm only gonna be connected
with the stage by marriage.

1079
01:34:20,637 --> 01:34:24,266
Oh, Hank, we found the cutest
little home down on Long Island.

1080
01:34:24,441 --> 01:34:26,272
- Yeah?
- Where Eddie can work.

1081
01:34:26,443 --> 01:34:30,379
And say, when you're finished with
this tour, you're coming to live with us.

1082
01:34:30,547 --> 01:34:34,643
Oh, nothing doing. Hotels for mine,
where I can get service.

1083
01:34:34,818 --> 01:34:38,254
- I'd be all out of step in a real home.
- What do you mean?

1084
01:34:38,422 --> 01:34:42,984
- You're coming to live with us, all right.
- I should say she is.

1085
01:34:44,561 --> 01:34:48,895
Just like a trouper.
Troupers are all tramps.

1086
01:34:49,066 --> 01:34:51,899
Here today and gone tomorrow.

1087
01:34:52,069 --> 01:34:55,232
No home, no nothing.

1088
01:34:55,439 --> 01:34:59,876
Hank, you're just a born trouper.

1089
01:35:09,052 --> 01:35:14,217
Doggone this weather. It certainly
is tough on colds, isn't it?

1090
01:35:16,627 --> 01:35:20,154
Well, say, I want Queenie
and Eddie to see the act.

1091
01:35:20,330 --> 01:35:22,230
Say, where is that blond, anyway?

1092
01:35:22,399 --> 01:35:25,027
I don't know. She's always late.

1093
01:35:28,372 --> 01:35:30,533
Hank, you're a sight for sore eyes.

1094
01:35:30,707 --> 01:35:33,175
- Hello, Uncle Jed.
- Oh, hello, Flo.

1095
01:35:33,343 --> 01:35:36,540
- You know everybody, don't you?
- Hello, darling.

1096
01:35:36,713 --> 01:35:39,409
- Oh, Eddie.
- Hello, Flo.

1097
01:35:39,583 --> 01:35:43,849
Oh, Eddie, tell me, did you have
a good time on your honeymoon?

1098
01:35:46,423 --> 01:35:48,516
Yeah, great.

1099
01:35:48,692 --> 01:35:52,389
Oh, Eddie, when you
open your new show...

1100
01:35:52,562 --> 01:35:55,622
...gonna give me a job, aren't you?
- Why, certainly.

1101
01:35:55,799 --> 01:35:57,699
Oh, you're grand.

1102
01:35:57,868 --> 01:36:00,530
Say, come on, stupid.
Let's run through the act for them.

1103
01:36:00,704 --> 01:36:02,569
Okay.

1104
01:36:03,407 --> 01:36:05,841
But, say, you know something?
She's a born trouper.

1105
01:36:06,009 --> 01:36:08,637
We're gonna break in the act
and bring it to New York.

1106
01:36:08,812 --> 01:36:10,712
- That's great.
- Say, step on it, will you?

1107
01:36:10,881 --> 01:36:12,542
- I've got a matinee.
- Sure.

1108
01:36:12,716 --> 01:36:13,705
I want two choruses...

1109
01:36:13,884 --> 01:36:16,216
...and you follow us, not us you.
- Come on, Flo.

1110
01:36:16,486 --> 01:36:20,547
Say, listen. There's gonna be no part
in your show for that dame, get me?

1111
01:36:20,724 --> 01:36:23,420
Of course not, honey.

1112
01:37:02,099 --> 01:37:06,001
It's kind of rough yet, but don't
you say it's pretty good for an opening?

1113
01:37:07,404 --> 01:37:10,237
You know, if you don't hurry,
you're gonna miss that train.

1114
01:37:10,407 --> 01:37:12,898
- Oh, the train.
- Sure, the train.

1115
01:37:13,076 --> 01:37:15,374
Oh, Hank. Hank, can I help you?

1116
01:37:15,545 --> 01:37:19,948
Yes, you could hold my coat for me.
I forgot all about the thing.

1117
01:37:22,686 --> 01:37:24,745
Oh, Hank.

1118
01:37:31,595 --> 01:37:33,654
That's all right, Queenie.

1119
01:37:37,834 --> 01:37:41,861
- Goodbye, Eddie.
- Goodbye, Hank.

1120
01:37:51,448 --> 01:37:53,245
Oh, you'll write to me soon, won't you?

1121
01:37:53,416 --> 01:37:57,853
Yeah, I'll write you from Peoria.
Now, where's my hat? Where's my hat?

1122
01:37:58,021 --> 01:38:00,319
- Oh, where's my hat!
- Here's your hat.

1123
01:38:03,360 --> 01:38:06,158
Here. Here. Here's your valise.

1124
01:38:06,329 --> 01:38:09,423
- All right. Bring it, Uncle Jed. Come on.
- It's pretty heavy.

1125
01:38:09,599 --> 01:38:11,658
- Goodbye, Hank.
- Goodbye, Hank.

1126
01:38:11,835 --> 01:38:16,135
- Goodbye, Hank.
- Don't forget to write. Goodbye.

1127
01:38:26,283 --> 01:38:29,411
Oh, don't cry, dear.
Hank won't be gone long.

1128
01:38:29,586 --> 01:38:33,716
The season will be over before you
know it, and she'll be back here with us.

1129
01:38:33,890 --> 01:38:35,482
It ain't that, honey.

1130
01:38:35,659 --> 01:38:40,494
But it seems like Hank
ain't never had a real break.

1131
01:38:40,664 --> 01:38:44,930
And I guess I haven't done much
to make her any happier.

1132
01:38:45,101 --> 01:38:47,592
I wouldn't feel that way about it, dear.

1133
01:38:47,771 --> 01:38:51,229
Hank'll be much happier back on the road.
Why, she couldn't give it up.

1134
01:38:51,408 --> 01:38:55,174
It's her life.
She couldn't live without it.

1135
01:38:56,880 --> 01:39:00,247
And now that she knows
you're taken care of...

1136
01:39:01,718 --> 01:39:04,152
Don't cry, honey.

1137
01:39:04,454 --> 01:39:07,389
People can't help falling in love.

1138
01:39:07,791 --> 01:39:10,817
It comes to you no matter what you do.

1139
01:39:11,728 --> 01:39:13,753
And I love you, dear.

1140
01:39:13,930 --> 01:39:16,194
Oh, and I love you, Eddie.

1141
01:39:16,366 --> 01:39:19,494
You were just meant for me.

1142
01:39:25,308 --> 01:39:27,401
Opening in Peoria.

1143
01:39:27,577 --> 01:39:30,273
Four shows a day.

1144
01:39:30,447 --> 01:39:33,245
Zanny said he'd make me
a star in six months.

1145
01:39:33,683 --> 01:39:37,676
Say, listen, it's better to star in...

1146
01:39:39,689 --> 01:39:43,750
In Oshkosh than to starve on Broadway.

1147
01:39:43,927 --> 01:39:45,622
That's a bunk.

1148
01:39:45,795 --> 01:39:49,754
Say, now you listen to me,
stupid. I'll handle things.

1149
01:39:49,933 --> 01:39:54,461
Yes, and I'll have you back on Broadway
and in the Palace in less than six months.

1150
01:39:54,638 --> 01:39:57,801
- No fooling?
- Why, it's cream in the can, baby.

1151
01:39:57,974 --> 01:40:00,738
Sure, it's...

1152
01:40:01,845 --> 01:40:04,973
It's... It's in the can.

1153
01:40:16,192 --> 01:40:18,183
