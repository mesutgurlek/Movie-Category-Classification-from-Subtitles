1
00:00:40,320 --> 00:00:43,080
Underneath these stairs I hear the sneers and

2
00:00:43,080 --> 00:00:45,460
feel the glares of my cousin,

3
00:00:45,460 --> 00:00:48,010
my uncle, and my aunt

4
00:00:48,750 --> 00:00:51,450
I can't believe how cruel they are

5
00:00:51,450 --> 00:00:55,320
and it stings my lightning scar to know they'll never

6
00:00:55,320 --> 00:00:58,080
ever give me what I want

7
00:00:58,980 --> 00:01:01,520
I know I don't deserve these

8
00:01:01,520 --> 00:01:05,280
stupid rules made by the Dursleys here on

9
00:01:05,760 --> 00:01:08,520
Privet Drive

10
00:01:09,890 --> 00:01:12,440
I can't take all of these muggles

11
00:01:12,440 --> 00:01:15,090
but despite all of my struggles

12
00:01:16,250 --> 00:01:19,170
I'm still alive

13
00:01:20,230 --> 00:01:23,350
I'm sick of summer and this waiting around

14
00:01:23,350 --> 00:01:26,590
man it's September and I'm skipping this town

15
00:01:27,170 --> 00:01:28,590
Hey it's no mystery

16
00:01:28,600 --> 00:01:32,100
there's nothing here for me now

17
00:01:32,200 --> 00:01:35,650
I gotta get back to Hogwarts

18
00:01:35,650 --> 00:01:39,040
I gotta get back to school

19
00:01:39,040 --> 00:01:41,900
I gotta get myself to Hogwarts

20
00:01:41,900 --> 00:01:45,930
Where everybody knows I'm cool

21
00:01:46,560 --> 00:01:50,490
Back to witches and wizards and magical beasts

22
00:01:50,490 --> 00:01:53,720
to goblins and ghosts and to magical feasts

23
00:01:53,720 --> 00:01:57,430
It's all that I love and it's all that I need at

24
00:01:57,430 --> 00:01:59,430
Hogwarts, Hogwarts

25
00:01:59,430 --> 00:02:01,430
I think I'm going back

26
00:02:04,210 --> 00:02:07,660
I'll see my friends gonna laugh 'till we cry

27
00:02:07,660 --> 00:02:11,050
Take my Firebolt, gonna take to the sky

28
00:02:11,050 --> 00:02:14,390
No way this year anyone's gonna die

29
00:02:14,390 --> 00:02:17,620
and it's gonna be totally awesome

30
00:02:17,620 --> 00:02:21,170
I'll cast some spells with the flick of my wand

31
00:02:21,170 --> 00:02:24,510
Defeat the Dark Arts, yeah bring it on

32
00:02:24,510 --> 00:02:27,690
and do it all with my best friend Ron

33
00:02:27,690 --> 00:02:30,550
'cause together we're totally awesome

34
00:02:30,550 --> 00:02:34,310
Ron: Yeah, and it's gonna be totally awesome!

35
00:02:34,470 --> 00:02:36,540
Did somebody say Ron Weasley?

36
00:02:37,540 --> 00:02:38,550
Harry: What's up buddy?

37
00:02:38,550 --> 00:02:39,290
Ron: Hey, what's up?
Harry: What's up buddy?

38
00:02:39,290 --> 00:02:39,400
Hey, sorry it took me so long to get here
Harry: What's up buddy?

39
00:02:39,400 --> 00:02:41,290
Hey, sorry it took me so long to get here

40
00:02:41,290 --> 00:02:43,480
I had to go get some... Floo Powder

41
00:02:43,480 --> 00:02:45,970
but uh, we gotta get going- come on get your trunk let's go

42
00:02:45,970 --> 00:02:46,610
Where we going?

43
00:02:46,610 --> 00:02:47,880
To Diagon Alley of course!

44
00:02:47,880 --> 00:02:48,350
Harry: Cool!

45
00:02:48,350 --> 00:02:49,200
Ron: Come on!
Harry: Cool!

46
00:02:49,200 --> 00:02:49,730
Ron: Come on!

47
00:02:49,730 --> 00:02:53,870
Floo Powder power! Floo Powder power! Floo Powder power! Floo Powder power!

48
00:02:54,980 --> 00:02:58,160
It's been so long, but we're going back

49
00:02:58,160 --> 00:03:01,440
Don't go for work, don't go there for class

50
00:03:01,440 --> 00:03:04,940
As long as we're together, gonna kick some ass

51
00:03:04,940 --> 00:03:08,440
and it's gonna be totally awesome!

52
00:03:08,440 --> 00:03:11,670
This year we'll take everybody by storm

53
00:03:11,670 --> 00:03:14,960
stay up all night, sneak out of our dorm

54
00:03:14,960 --> 00:03:19,200
Hermione: But let's not forget that we need to perform well in class

55
00:03:19,200 --> 00:03:21,950
if we want to pass our O.W.L.s

56
00:03:21,950 --> 00:03:24,550
God Hermione, why do you have to be such a buzzkill?

57
00:03:24,550 --> 00:03:27,680
Because guys, school's not all about having fun

58
00:03:27,680 --> 00:03:30,910
We need to study hard if we want to be good witches and wizards

59
00:03:31,650 --> 00:03:35,040
I may be frumpy but I'm super smart

60
00:03:35,040 --> 00:03:38,330
Check out my grades, they're A's for a start!

61
00:03:38,330 --> 00:03:41,400
What I lack in looks well I make up in heart

62
00:03:41,400 --> 00:03:44,470
and well guys, yeah that's totally awesome!

63
00:03:44,470 --> 00:03:48,180
This year I plan to study a lot

64
00:03:48,180 --> 00:03:51,520
Ron: That would be cool if you were actually hot!

65
00:03:51,520 --> 00:03:54,700
Harry: Hey Ron, come on, we're the only friend's that she's got

66
00:03:54,700 --> 00:03:55,340
Harry: And that's cool

67
00:03:55,340 --> 00:03:57,460
Hermione: And that's totally awesome
Harry: And that's cool

68
00:03:57,460 --> 00:04:01,110
Yeah, it's so cool, and it's totally awesome!

69
00:04:02,920 --> 00:04:05,880
We're sick of summer and this waiting around

70
00:04:05,880 --> 00:04:09,280
it's like we're sitting in the lost and found

71
00:04:09,280 --> 00:04:14,630
Don't take no sorcery for anyone to see how

72
00:04:14,630 --> 00:04:18,120
We gotta get back to Hogwarts!

73
00:04:18,120 --> 00:04:21,360
We gotta get back to school

74
00:04:21,360 --> 00:04:24,910
We gotta get back to Hogwarts

75
00:04:24,910 --> 00:04:28,780
Where everything is magic-cooool

76
00:04:29,090 --> 00:04:32,750
Back to witches and wizards and magical beasts

77
00:04:32,750 --> 00:04:36,140
to goblins and ghosts and to magical feasts

78
00:04:36,140 --> 00:04:39,750
It's all that I love and it's all that I need at

79
00:04:39,750 --> 00:04:41,760
Hogwarts, Hogwarts

80
00:04:41,760 --> 00:04:43,760
I think we're going back

81
00:04:43,971 --> 00:04:45,741
Ginny: Ron...!

82
00:04:45,741 --> 00:04:50,131
You're supposed to take me to Madame Malkin's and use those sickles mom gave you for my robe fitting!

83
00:04:50,131 --> 00:04:51,241
Harry: Uh who's this?

84
00:04:51,241 --> 00:04:54,431
This is stupid little dumb sister Ginny. She's a freshmen.

85
00:04:54,431 --> 00:04:56,861
Ginny, this is Harry. Harry Potter

86
00:04:56,861 --> 00:04:57,931
This is Harry Potter

87
00:04:58,551 --> 00:05:01,251
You're Harry Potter... you're The Boy Who Lived

88
00:05:01,251 --> 00:05:02,341
Yeah, and you're Ginny

89
00:05:02,341 --> 00:05:03,681
It's Ginevra

90
00:05:03,771 --> 00:05:05,181
Cool... Ginny's fine

91
00:05:05,181 --> 00:05:06,881
Stupid sister!

92
00:05:06,921 --> 00:05:08,181
Don't crowd the famous friend

93
00:05:08,181 --> 00:05:10,591
Hermione: Hey, do you guys hear music or something?

94
00:05:10,591 --> 00:05:11,701
Harry: Music? What are you talking about?

95
00:05:11,701 --> 00:05:12,591
Ron: Yeah, someone's coming
Harry: Music? What are you talking about?

96
00:05:12,591 --> 00:05:12,661
Ron: Yeah, someone's coming

97
00:05:12,661 --> 00:05:13,811
Harry: Someone's coming...

98
00:05:15,541 --> 00:05:16,921
Cho Chang!

99
00:05:17,261 --> 00:05:20,161
Domo arigato. Cho Chang!

100
00:05:20,671 --> 00:05:23,471
Gung Hey Fat, Choy Chang

101
00:05:23,931 --> 00:05:25,771
Happy, happy New Year

102

Cho Chang!

103
00:05:29,501 --> 00:05:31,201
Ginny: Whoa... who's that?

104
00:05:31,741 --> 00:05:32,781
Harry: That's Cho Chang

105
00:05:32,781 --> 00:05:35,981
Ron: That's the girl Harry's totally been in love with since freshmen year

106
00:05:35,981 --> 00:05:37,791
Hermione: Yeah but he won't say anything to her

107
00:05:37,791 --> 00:05:41,011
Ron: Well yeah, you never tell a girl you like her it makes you look like an idiot

108
00:05:43,251 --> 00:05:45,231
Ginny: Konnichiwa Cho Chang

109
00:05:45,231 --> 00:05:49,041
It is good to meet you. I am Ginny Weasley

110
00:05:49,381 --> 00:05:51,041
Bitch I ain't Cho Chang!

111
00:05:52,131 --> 00:05:53,671
That's Lavender Brown!

112
00:05:53,921 --> 00:05:54,931
Racist sister!

113
00:05:54,931 --> 00:05:55,541
Harry: Racist, yeah that's racist
Racist sister!

114
00:05:55,541 --> 00:05:56,311
Harry: Racist, yeah that's racist

115
00:05:56,311 --> 00:05:57,401
Hey, it's alright!

116
00:05:57,401 --> 00:05:59,401
I'm Cho Chang y'all

117
00:06:00,171 --> 00:06:01,791
Harry: She is totally perfect!

118
00:06:01,791 --> 00:06:03,991
Ron: Yeah, too bad she's dating Cedric Diggory though, huh?

119
00:06:03,991 --> 00:06:05,991
What? Who the hell is Cedric Diggory?

120
00:06:05,991 --> 00:06:07,991
What is that? Who is that guy?

121
00:06:07,991 --> 00:06:10,491
Cedric: Cho Chang...

122
00:06:10,911 --> 00:06:14,921
I am so in love, with Cho Chang

123
00:06:14,921 --> 00:06:19,871
from Bangkok to Ding Dang

124
00:06:19,871 --> 00:06:25,881
I sing my love aloud for Cho Chang

125
00:06:26,921 --> 00:06:28,561
Harry: I hate that guy! I hate him!

126
00:06:28,561 --> 00:06:30,561
Ron: So are we gonna get those robes or not?

127
00:06:30,561 --> 00:06:31,311
Ginny: Okay alright I'm going!

128
00:06:31,311 --> 00:06:32,561
Ron: God sister!
Ginny: Okay alright I'm going!

129
00:06:32,561 --> 00:06:32,821
Ron: God sister!

130
00:06:37,941 --> 00:06:39,861
Goyle: Present your arm nerd!

131
00:06:39,861 --> 00:06:40,841
Neville: W-what what why?

132
00:06:40,841 --> 00:06:42,181
Goyle: Indian Burn Hex!

133
00:06:47,151 --> 00:06:48,491
Ron: Crabbe and Goyle...

134
00:06:48,491 --> 00:06:48,941
Harry: Hey, hey why don't you leave Neville Longbottom alone, huh?

135
00:06:48,941 --> 00:06:51,201
Ginny: Are you okay?
Harry: Hey, hey why don't you leave Neville Longbottom alone, huh?

136
00:06:51,201 --> 00:06:52,291
Harry: Hey, hey why don't you leave Neville Longbottom alone, huh?

137
00:06:52,291 --> 00:06:55,461
Goyle: Well, well, well if it isn't Harry Potter

138
00:06:55,461 --> 00:06:59,581
You think all because you're famous, you can boss everyone around!

139
00:06:59,581 --> 00:07:03,051
Harry: No I just don't think it's cool for guys of your size to be picking on guys like Neville, come on!

140
00:07:03,051 --> 00:07:04,371
Oh well you know what I think?

141
00:07:04,371 --> 00:07:07,101
I think glasses are for nerds!

142
00:07:07,531 --> 00:07:08,551
Break!

143
00:07:09,041 --> 00:07:10,081
We hate nerds!

144
00:07:10,081 --> 00:07:11,731
Crabbe: And girls!
We hate nerds!

145
00:07:11,811 --> 00:07:13,371
Ron: Well you asked for it

146
00:07:13,371 --> 00:07:16,611
You don't mess with Harry Potter, he beat the Dark Lord when he was a baby!

147
00:07:16,611 --> 00:07:18,611
Hermione: Alright, everyone just calm down

148
00:07:18,611 --> 00:07:20,381
Oculus Reparo!

149
00:07:20,381 --> 00:07:21,401
Whoa cool!

150
00:07:23,681 --> 00:07:26,941
Now let's leave these big baby childish jerks alone!

151
00:07:26,941 --> 00:07:32,081
Did someone say Draco Malfoy?

152
00:07:34,081 --> 00:07:35,381
Harry: What do you want, Draco?

153
00:07:35,381 --> 00:07:37,381
Draco: Crabbe, Goyle

154
00:07:37,381 --> 00:07:40,461
Be a pair of turtle doves so go pay for my robes will you?

155
00:07:40,841 --> 00:07:45,871
So... Potter! Back for another year of Hogwarts are you?

156
00:07:45,871 --> 00:07:49,901
Maybe this year you'll wise up and hang out with a higher caliber of wizard!

157
00:07:49,901 --> 00:07:50,751
Harry: Hey listen

158
00:07:51,861 --> 00:07:55,271
Ron and Hermione are my best friends in the whole world, I wouldn't trade them for anything

159
00:07:56,661 --> 00:07:58,411
Have it your way

160
00:07:58,431 --> 00:08:01,471
Wait... don't tell me!

161
00:08:01,501 --> 00:08:06,611
Red hair, hand-me-down clothes, and a stupid complexion...

162
00:08:06,631 --> 00:08:08,191
You must be a Weasley!

163
00:08:08,191 --> 00:08:12,031
Ron: Oh my God lay off Malfoy! She may be a pain in the ass, okay?

164
00:08:12,371 --> 00:08:14,031
but she's my pain in the ass

165
00:08:14,031 --> 00:08:16,031
Well isn't this cute?

166
00:08:16,031 --> 00:08:18,461
It's like a little loser family!

167
00:08:18,461 --> 00:08:21,451
Hogwarts has really gone to the dogs

168
00:08:21,451 --> 00:08:22,811
Luckily next year...

169
00:08:22,811 --> 00:08:25,601
I'll be transferred to Pigfarts!

170
00:08:26,501 --> 00:08:29,571
This year you bet, gonna get out of here

171
00:08:29,571 --> 00:08:32,811
The reign of Malfoy is drawing near

172
00:08:32,811 --> 00:08:35,941
I'll have the greatest wizard career

173
00:08:35,941 --> 00:08:38,561
It's gonna be totally awesome!

174
00:08:38,971 --> 00:08:41,891
Look out world for the dawn of the day

175
00:08:41,891 --> 00:08:43,891
when everyone will do

176
00:08:43,891 --> 00:08:45,231
Whatever I say!

177
00:08:45,231 --> 00:08:47,371
and Potter won't be in my way

178
00:08:47,371 --> 00:08:50,761
and then I'll be the one who is totally awesome!

179
00:08:50,761 --> 00:08:54,291
Goyle: Yeah you'll be the one who is totally awesome!

180
00:08:55,381 --> 00:08:57,581
Hermione: Guys come on we're gonna miss the train!

181
00:09:02,121 --> 00:09:05,081
Who knows how fast this year's gonna go?

182
00:09:05,081 --> 00:09:08,261
Hand me a glass, let the butterbeer flow

183
00:09:08,261 --> 00:09:11,241
Harry: Maybe at last, I'll talk to Cho!

184
00:09:11,241 --> 00:09:13,931
Ron: Oh no, that'd be way too awesome

185
00:09:14,291 --> 00:09:17,551
We're back to learn everything that we can

186
00:09:17,551 --> 00:09:20,621
It's great to come back to where we began

187
00:09:20,621 --> 00:09:23,561
and here we are- and Alakazam!

188
00:09:23,561 --> 00:09:26,481
Here we go, this is totally awesome!

189
00:09:29,631 --> 00:09:32,811
Come on and teach us everything you know

190
00:09:32,811 --> 00:09:35,961
The summer's over and we're itching to go

191
00:09:35,961 --> 00:09:37,861
Neville: I think we're ready for

192
00:09:37,861 --> 00:09:39,061
Albus Dumbledore!

193
00:09:43,601 --> 00:09:51,951
Dumbledore: Welcoooooome

194
00:09:51,951 --> 00:09:54,341
all of you to Hogwarts

195
00:09:54,911 --> 00:09:59,091
I welcome all of you to school

196
00:09:59,691 --> 00:10:02,821
Did you know that here at Hogwarts

197
00:10:03,271 --> 00:10:07,431
we've got a hidden swimming pool?

198
00:10:07,431 --> 00:10:11,091
Welcome, welcome, welcome Hogwarts

199
00:10:11,091 --> 00:10:15,121
Welcome hotties, nerds, and tools

200
00:10:15,121 --> 00:10:18,921
Now that I've got you here at Hogwarts

201
00:10:18,921 --> 00:10:22,131
I'd like to go over just a couple of rules

202
00:10:22,131 --> 00:10:25,331
My name is Albus Dumbledore and I am headmaster at Hogwarts

203
00:10:25,331 --> 00:10:28,041
You can all call me Dumbledore

204
00:10:28,041 --> 00:10:31,681
Of course you could always call me Albus if you wanted detention

205
00:10:31,681 --> 00:10:34,431
I'm just kidding, I'll expel you if you call me Albus

206
00:10:36,371 --> 00:10:39,951
Back to witches and wizards and magical beasts

207
00:10:39,951 --> 00:10:43,091
to goblins and ghosts and to magical feasts

208
00:10:43,091 --> 00:10:46,581
It's all that I love and it's all that I need at

209
00:10:46,581 --> 00:10:48,581
Hogwarts, Hogwarts

210
00:10:50,401 --> 00:10:53,961
Back to spells and enchantments, potions and friends

211
00:10:53,961 --> 00:10:56,281
To Griffindor! Hufflepuff! Ravenclaw!

212
00:10:56,281 --> 00:10:57,501
SLYTHERINS!

213
00:10:57,501 --> 00:11:00,541
Back to the place where our story begins at

214
00:11:00,541 --> 00:11:02,361
Hogwarts, Hogwarts

215
00:11:02,361 --> 00:11:03,741
Dumbledore: I'm sorry what's it's name?

216
00:11:03,741 --> 00:11:04,081
Hogwarts, Hogwarts
Dumbledore: I'm sorry what's it's name?

217
00:11:04,081 --> 00:11:05,421
Hogwarts, Hogwarts

218
00:11:05,421 --> 00:11:06,731
Dumbledore: I didn't hear you kids!

219
00:11:06,731 --> 00:11:08,581
Hogwarts, Hogwarts

220
00:11:08,581 --> 00:11:09,861
Harry: Man I'm glad I'm back

221
00:11:24,312 --> 00:11:28,192
Welcome to another magical year at Hogwarts

222
00:11:28,192 --> 00:11:31,432
and a very special welcome to my favorite student

223
00:11:31,432 --> 00:11:33,612
Mister Harry Potter

224
00:11:34,372 --> 00:11:37,362
He killed Voldemort when he was just a baby

225
00:11:37,362 --> 00:11:40,682
He's even got that little lightning scar on his forehead to prove it

226
00:11:41,962 --> 00:11:45,712
And another very special welcome to our newest addition to Griffindor,

227
00:11:45,712 --> 00:11:46,822
Mister Ginny-

228
00:11:46,822 --> 00:11:49,722
Excuse me, Misses Ginny Weasley

229
00:11:50,442 --> 00:11:53,432
Ginny: Yeah, I'm a girl... and um, also

230
00:11:53,432 --> 00:11:56,502
Aren't we supposed to be sorted by the Sorting Hat?

231
00:11:56,502 --> 00:11:59,102
Dumbledore: Well um, a funny thing happened to the Sorting Hat

232
00:11:59,102 --> 00:12:03,062
He actually got hitched with another piece of enchanted magical clothing

233
00:12:03,062 --> 00:12:06,662
So he and the Scarf of Sexual Preference

234
00:12:06,712 --> 00:12:09,142
aren't going to be back until next year

235
00:12:12,102 --> 00:12:15,832
Basically I've just been putting anybody who looks like a good guy into Gryffindor

236
00:12:15,832 --> 00:12:17,812
anybody who looks like a bad guy into Slytherin

237
00:12:17,832 --> 00:12:19,302
and the other two could just go wherever the hell they want

238
00:12:19,302 --> 00:12:20,392
I don't really care

239
00:12:22,402 --> 00:12:25,192
Cedric: Hufflepuffs are particularly good Finders!

240
00:12:25,192 --> 00:12:27,832
What the hell is a Hufflepuff?

241
00:12:32,442 --> 00:12:35,892
Anyway it's time for me to introduce my very good friend

242
00:12:35,892 --> 00:12:37,592
our own Potions professor,

243
00:12:37,592 --> 00:12:39,362
Mister Severus Snape

244
00:12:39,362 --> 00:12:40,512
Ron: Aw man

245
00:12:40,512 --> 00:12:42,392
That Snape, I'd hoped they'd fired that guy

246
00:12:42,392 --> 00:12:43,732
Ginny: Why? What's wrong with Professor Snape?

247
00:12:43,732 --> 00:12:45,332
Ron: Uh, nothing. He's just, uh

248
00:12:45,332 --> 00:12:46,142
the Devil

249
00:12:54,392 --> 00:12:56,272
Ron: He's Harry's nemesis, look at him

250
00:12:56,762 --> 00:12:59,612
Harry: Come on Ron, he's really not that bad. I don't know what you're talking about-

251
00:12:59,612 --> 00:13:01,612
Snape: Harry Potter...

252
00:13:02,922 --> 00:13:04,562
Detention

253
00:13:04,812 --> 00:13:05,602
What?

254
00:13:05,602 --> 00:13:07,602
For talking out of turn

255
00:13:09,312 --> 00:13:13,982
Now before we begin, I'm going to give you all your very, very first

256
00:13:13,982 --> 00:13:15,072
Pop quiz

257
00:13:15,082 --> 00:13:16,642
Hermione: Yesss...

258
00:13:16,642 --> 00:13:19,672
Can anyone tell me what a Portkey is?

259
00:13:19,672 --> 00:13:20,762
Ah yes, Miss Granger

260
00:13:20,762 --> 00:13:22,762
A Portkey is an enchanted object that when touched

261
00:13:22,762 --> 00:13:25,912
will transport the one or ones who touch it to anywhere in the globe decided upon by the enchanter

262
00:13:25,912 --> 00:13:27,712
Ah very good...

263
00:13:29,012 --> 00:13:31,782
Now can anyone tell me what foreshadowing is?

264
00:13:32,252 --> 00:13:33,722
Yes Miss Granger?

265
00:13:33,722 --> 00:13:36,272
Foreshadowing is a dramatic device in which an important plot point

266
00:13:36,272 --> 00:13:38,942
is mentioned earlier in the story to return later in a more significant way

267
00:13:41,792 --> 00:13:42,712
Perfect!

268
00:13:42,712 --> 00:13:44,712
So... What's a- what's a Portkey exactly?

269
00:13:45,122 --> 00:13:45,482
Hermione: Oh, a Portkey is something that when you touch it, it will transport you anywhere

270
00:13:45,482 --> 00:13:46,122
Ron: Not you-
Hermione: Oh, a Portkey is something that when you touch it, it will transport you anywhere

271
00:13:46,122 --> 00:13:47,952
Oh my God...
Hermione: Oh, a Portkey is something that when you touch it, it will transport you anywhere

272
00:13:47,952 --> 00:13:52,032
And remember a Portkey can be any sort of seemly harmless object like

273
00:13:52,392 --> 00:13:53,732
a football or...

274
00:13:54,032 --> 00:13:54,842
A dolphin

275
00:13:57,062 --> 00:13:58,362
Professor?

276
00:13:58,362 --> 00:13:59,762
Can like a person be a Portkey?

277
00:13:59,762 --> 00:14:01,062
No that's absurd

278
00:14:02,392 --> 00:14:06,072
Because then if a person were to touch themselves...

279
00:14:09,332 --> 00:14:12,772
They would constantly be transported into different places

280
00:14:13,452 --> 00:14:15,662
A person can however be a Horcrux

281
00:14:15,662 --> 00:14:17,142
What's a... what's a Horcrux?

282
00:14:17,142 --> 00:14:19,572
I'm not even going to tell you Harry, you'll find out soon enough

283
00:14:21,312 --> 00:14:22,952
Professor, what is the point of this quiz?

284
00:14:22,952 --> 00:14:25,512
Oh no, no no point in particular

285
00:14:25,702 --> 00:14:28,602
Just important information that everyone should know

286
00:14:29,822 --> 00:14:30,802
Especially you

287
00:14:32,182 --> 00:14:35,322
Now moving right along, we've got our four houses in all

288
00:14:35,322 --> 00:14:36,852
Gryffindor

289
00:14:36,872 --> 00:14:38,302
Ravenclaw

290
00:14:38,302 --> 00:14:39,202
Hufflepuff

291
00:14:39,202 --> 00:14:39,642
Cedric: Find!

292
00:14:39,642 --> 00:14:40,242
Snape: What?

293
00:14:43,652 --> 00:14:44,722
And Slytherin

294
00:14:46,382 --> 00:14:48,132
Now traditionally...

295
00:14:51,052 --> 00:14:55,012
Traditionally points are given for good behavior and deducted for rule breaking

296
00:14:55,442 --> 00:14:56,502
Example:

297
00:14:56,502 --> 00:14:58,382
Ten points from Gryffindor

298
00:14:59,452 --> 00:15:01,982
for Miss Granger's excessive baby fat

299
00:15:03,942 --> 00:15:05,262
Thanks Hermione

300
00:15:05,262 --> 00:15:09,342
Traditionally the house with the most points at the end of the year would win the House Cup

301
00:15:09,342 --> 00:15:11,892
however this year we're doing things a bit differently

302
00:15:12,302 --> 00:15:15,992
Here to introduce it is our new Professor of the Dark Arts

303
00:15:15,992 --> 00:15:17,072
Professor Quirrell

304
00:15:17,072 --> 00:15:17,882
Harry: Ow ow oww

305
00:15:17,882 --> 00:15:18,442
Hermione: Harry, what's wrong?
Harry: Ow ow oww

306
00:15:18,442 --> 00:15:18,692
Hermione: Harry, what's wrong?

307
00:15:37,542 --> 00:15:38,962
The House Cup

308
00:15:39,222 --> 00:15:41,612
a time honored tradition

309
00:15:41,612 --> 00:15:42,482
for centuries-

310
00:15:42,502 --> 00:15:44,362
Draco: Go home terrorist!

311
00:15:48,512 --> 00:15:51,632
For centuries... the four houses of Hogwarts

312
00:15:51,632 --> 00:15:55,592
have competed for the honor and glory of holding the title of House Champion

313
00:15:55,592 --> 00:15:59,852
But where does this competition come from and what are the roots of the tradition?

314
00:15:59,852 --> 00:16:02,672
The House Cup Tournament began with the first generation of Hogwarts students

315
00:16:03,352 --> 00:16:05,162
That was a rhetorical question

316
00:16:06,272 --> 00:16:09,382
Dumbledore: Granger, quit interrupting. Twenty points from Gryffindor

317
00:16:09,382 --> 00:16:10,982
Ron: Thanks Hermione

318
00:16:11,152 --> 00:16:12,512
Quirrell: As I was saying...

319
00:16:12,512 --> 00:16:16,692
When the tournament first originated it was one of a completely different sort

320
00:16:16,912 --> 00:16:22,152
One champion from each of the four houses would complete a series of dangerous tasks

321
00:16:22,602 --> 00:16:25,732
Challenges- the winner would not only win the cup

322
00:16:25,732 --> 00:16:27,732
He would also win eternal glory

323
00:16:27,732 --> 00:16:30,552
Hermione: Kind of like a House Cup- or no, a Triwizard Tournament!

324
00:16:31,252 --> 00:16:34,212
Quirrell: Yes. Sort of like the Triwizard Tournament

325
00:16:34,212 --> 00:16:36,732
except no, not like that at all

326
00:16:37,182 --> 00:16:38,432
There are four houses

327
00:16:38,432 --> 00:16:41,502
How can it be the Triwizard Tournament with four teams?

328
00:16:41,502 --> 00:16:43,382
Well uh Professor if I remember correctly

329
00:16:43,382 --> 00:16:46,262
the House Cup Tournament was disbanded after one semester

330
00:16:46,282 --> 00:16:48,862
when one of its students was killed during the first task

331
00:16:48,862 --> 00:16:50,862
Yes, it is very dangerous

332
00:16:50,862 --> 00:16:53,142
but the rewards far outweigh the risks

333
00:16:53,872 --> 00:16:56,152
I don't think you heard me. I just said somebody died!

334
00:16:56,152 --> 00:16:58,982
Dumbledore: Hermione Granger shut your ungodly, lopsided mouth

335
00:16:58,982 --> 00:17:00,622
and quit interrupting. Twenty more points!

336
00:17:00,882 --> 00:17:02,352
Ron: Thanks Hermione!

337
00:17:04,052 --> 00:17:04,762
God...

338
00:17:04,762 --> 00:17:07,762
For the cleverest witch of your age, you really can be a dumbass sometimes

339
00:17:10,492 --> 00:17:12,282
Ten points to Dumbledore

340
00:17:15,162 --> 00:17:17,572
Yes, yes well it will be very dangerous

341
00:17:17,572 --> 00:17:21,062
but the winner will be remembered as a hero for ages to come

342
00:17:21,322 --> 00:17:24,222
And as professor of Defense Against the Dark Arts

343
00:17:24,222 --> 00:17:29,682
I believe that this practical application is exactly what the curriculum needs to-

344
00:17:29,682 --> 00:17:30,682
ACHOO!

345
00:17:30,682 --> 00:17:32,002
Dumbledore: Gesundheit

346
00:17:36,282 --> 00:17:38,952
Did your turban just sneeze?

347
00:17:38,952 --> 00:17:40,722
W-what? N-no

348
00:17:40,722 --> 00:17:44,922
I could have sworn I heard a sneeze coming from your direction but your mouth wasn't moving

349
00:17:44,922 --> 00:17:46,192
No... that-

350
00:17:46,192 --> 00:17:48,582
That was simply a fart, excuse me

351
00:17:49,862 --> 00:17:50,592
ACHOO!

352
00:17:51,572 --> 00:17:54,062
Harry: Ow ow oww! Oww, oh...

353
00:17:54,062 --> 00:17:54,722
Jeez... oh my God oww

354
00:17:54,722 --> 00:17:56,532
Quirrell: I must be going
Jeez... oh my God oww

355
00:17:56,532 --> 00:17:56,552
Jeez... oh my God oww

356
00:17:58,772 --> 00:17:59,522
ACHOO!

357
00:17:59,522 --> 00:18:01,932
Quirrell: I've simply farted once more, excuse me.

358
00:18:03,372 --> 00:18:06,172
Dumbledore: In co-ordinance with the newly resurrected House Cup

359
00:18:06,172 --> 00:18:09,622
a champion from each house will be selected to compete

360
00:18:09,622 --> 00:18:11,942
So Snape, would you do us the honors please?

361
00:18:11,942 --> 00:18:13,952
Yes headmaster

362
00:18:15,012 --> 00:18:17,912
First, from the Ravenclaw house...

363
00:18:19,342 --> 00:18:20,752
Miss Cho Chang

364
00:18:20,752 --> 00:18:23,472
Oh my God I've won- I can't believe it, y'all!

365
00:18:25,522 --> 00:18:27,012
And next from Hufflepuff...

366
00:18:28,552 --> 00:18:30,702
a Mister Cedric Diggory

367
00:18:31,752 --> 00:18:33,792
Well I don't <i>find</i> this surprising at all

368
00:18:36,012 --> 00:18:37,162
Cho: I find it perfect

369
00:18:37,162 --> 00:18:39,912
now I can spend more time with my beloved boyfriend

370
00:18:39,912 --> 00:18:41,912
I'm glad as well my darling

371
00:18:42,042 --> 00:18:45,412
Snape: And next, from the Slytherin house...

372
00:18:46,392 --> 00:18:47,992
A Draco Malfoy

373
00:18:49,952 --> 00:18:52,172
I finally beat you didn't I, Potter?

374
00:18:52,172 --> 00:18:53,272
What do you think of that, huh?

375
00:18:53,272 --> 00:18:55,682
I'm the champion this time!

376
00:18:56,902 --> 00:18:58,942
Dumbledore: Draco would you sit down you little shit?

377
00:18:58,942 --> 00:19:00,392
Champion's just a title

378
00:19:03,892 --> 00:19:07,642
Snape: And finally from the Gryffindor house...

379
00:19:08,602 --> 00:19:10,302
Oh my

380
00:19:10,302 --> 00:19:11,972
Well isn't this curious?

381
00:19:11,972 --> 00:19:15,852
The one person in all of Hogwarts whom I have a well-known grudge against

382
00:19:15,852 --> 00:19:19,492
is suddenly in a tournament where he may very well lose his life

383
00:19:19,492 --> 00:19:23,542
Neville: If it's me, I'll apologize to my fellow Gryffindors right now for losing

384
00:19:23,562 --> 00:19:26,102
Sit down you inarticulate bumble

385
00:19:27,162 --> 00:19:28,192
It's Harry Potter

386
00:19:32,902 --> 00:19:35,822
Dumbledore: Well here they are folks, the four Hogwarts champions

387
00:19:35,822 --> 00:19:40,422
I want all of you to start preparing immediately because the first task is in two months

388
00:19:40,422 --> 00:19:42,432
and it could be anything

389
00:19:42,812 --> 00:19:44,172
So let's get to it!

390
00:19:46,032 --> 00:19:46,992
Cho Chang! Cho Chang! Cho Chang! Cho Chang!

391
00:19:46,992 --> 00:19:50,212
Draco: Malfoy! Malfoy! Mal- Mal...
Cho Chang! Cho Chang! Cho Chang! Cho Chang!

392
00:19:50,212 --> 00:19:50,952
Cho Chang! Cho Chang! Cho Chang! Cho Chang!

393
00:19:51,803 --> 00:19:52,653
Ron: Harry

394
00:19:52,653 --> 00:19:54,553
You got this tournament in the bag

395
00:19:54,553 --> 00:19:56,643
I don't know man... Cedric Diggory, he's pretty awesome-

396
00:19:56,643 --> 00:19:57,233
NOT!

397
00:19:57,233 --> 00:19:59,473
He sucks. We're totally gonna win, it's in the bag

398
00:20:01,283 --> 00:20:02,563
I don't know, Harry

399
00:20:02,563 --> 00:20:02,803
Ron: OH MY GOD
I don't know, Harry

400
00:20:02,803 --> 00:20:03,463
Ron: OH MY GOD

401
00:20:03,463 --> 00:20:04,693
Hermione, shut up.

402
00:20:06,613 --> 00:20:08,963
Why do you have you rain on everybody's parade?

403
00:20:08,963 --> 00:20:11,773
Because, Ron, this is dangerous!

404
00:20:11,773 --> 00:20:13,993
Dangerous? Oh come on Hermione, how dangerous can it be?

405
00:20:13,993 --> 00:20:14,953
Especially for me

406
00:20:14,953 --> 00:20:18,273
Well- you're not invincible, Harry. Somebody died in this tournament.

407
00:20:18,273 --> 00:20:19,913
Uh, I'm The Boy That Lived

408
00:20:19,913 --> 00:20:21,473
Not died. Duhh

409
00:20:22,003 --> 00:20:23,113
What's the worst that can happen?

410
00:20:23,113 --> 00:20:25,053
And I don't know about that Quirrell character

411
00:20:25,053 --> 00:20:27,883
You know, first he resurrects some horrible ancient tournament

412
00:20:27,883 --> 00:20:29,893
Then- then he bumps into you and your scar starts to hurt

413
00:20:29,893 --> 00:20:33,323
and you have to admit, there is something really funky about the back of his head

414
00:20:34,283 --> 00:20:35,283
Come on, think about it

415
00:20:35,283 --> 00:20:38,503
Professor Quirrell is a professor, and who hires the professors?

416
00:20:38,503 --> 00:20:39,423
Dumbledore

417
00:20:39,423 --> 00:20:41,423
The smartest, most awesomest

418
00:20:41,423 --> 00:20:42,533
Practical wizard

419
00:20:42,533 --> 00:20:43,323
Beautiful wizard

420
00:20:43,323 --> 00:20:44,253
in the whole world

421
00:20:44,253 --> 00:20:47,493
Why... why would he possibly hire somebody who's trying to hurt me?

422
00:20:47,493 --> 00:20:49,163
W-What about Snape?

423
00:20:49,163 --> 00:20:50,373
Yeah what about him?

424
00:20:50,373 --> 00:20:52,503
He's hated you for years

425
00:20:52,503 --> 00:20:55,443
and he's hated your parents too, Harry, everybody knows that

426
00:20:55,443 --> 00:20:59,793
and he just so happens to pick your name out of the House Cup, out of hundreds

427
00:20:59,793 --> 00:21:01,793
if not, five possible Gryffindors?

428
00:21:03,253 --> 00:21:05,023
Yeah... what a coincidence. We lucked out

429
00:21:05,023 --> 00:21:07,403
No- no Harry, I don't think it is a coincidence

430
00:21:07,403 --> 00:21:10,133
When you defeated Voldemort, you made a lot of enemies. Ones you may not even know about

431
00:21:10,133 --> 00:21:10,963
Harry: Okay
When you defeated Voldemort, you made a lot of enemies. Ones you may not even know about

432
00:21:10,963 --> 00:21:11,353
When you defeated Voldemort, you made a lot of enemies. Ones you may not even know about

433
00:21:11,353 --> 00:21:11,543
Harry: Alright cool, so let me get this straight
When you defeated Voldemort, you made a lot of enemies. Ones you may not even know about

434
00:21:11,543 --> 00:21:12,453
Harry: Alright cool, so let me get this straight

435
00:21:12,453 --> 00:21:16,043
So you're saying that this tournament, is just one big ploy to try and kill me

436
00:21:16,043 --> 00:21:18,173
Hermione: I mean, I don't know! Maybe?

437
00:21:18,703 --> 00:21:21,683
Anyway I just think it's dangerous and I don't think you should do it

438
00:21:22,523 --> 00:21:24,923
Alright Hermione if it means that much to you...

439
00:21:24,923 --> 00:21:25,883
I'll drop out

440
00:21:25,883 --> 00:21:27,183
Oh thank you Harry

441
00:21:27,183 --> 00:21:28,103
Ron: Wait, wait

442
00:21:28,233 --> 00:21:28,873
WHAT?

443
00:21:28,873 --> 00:21:30,343
The House Cup?

444
00:21:30,343 --> 00:21:32,493
What about all the eternal glory you'd win? Come on!

445
00:21:32,493 --> 00:21:34,493
Hey... eternal glory

446
00:21:34,883 --> 00:21:35,793
I've already got that

447
00:21:37,313 --> 00:21:38,613
Besides, Neville will be a great champion!

448
00:21:38,613 --> 00:21:38,993
Ron: No, no, no
Besides, Neville will be a great champion!

449
00:21:38,993 --> 00:21:39,933
Ron: No, no, no

450
00:21:39,933 --> 00:21:42,043
I do not want Schlongbottom to be my champion

451
00:21:43,233 --> 00:21:44,663
Okay all you have to do- Oh look

452
00:21:44,663 --> 00:21:47,713
There's Dumbledore. Why don't you just talk to him now and tell him that you're dropping out?

453
00:21:47,713 --> 00:21:50,403
Um... listen, listen Hermione

454
00:21:50,403 --> 00:21:52,803
Dumbledore and I are really, really cool. We're super tight

455
00:21:52,803 --> 00:21:55,723
and I don't want him to think that I'm being lazy or disrespectful or anything

456
00:21:55,723 --> 00:21:59,333
So can you just tell-? Why don't you tell him? Just tell him that I want to work on school or something

457
00:21:59,333 --> 00:22:00,463
Alright? Hey

458
00:22:00,463 --> 00:22:02,633
You got this one. You're the best

459
00:22:03,213 --> 00:22:03,783
Hermione: Alright... okay

460
00:22:03,783 --> 00:22:04,443
Harry: You got it
Hermione: Alright... okay

461
00:22:04,443 --> 00:22:04,443
Harry: Don't worry about it
Hermione: Alright... okay

462
00:22:04,443 --> 00:22:05,363
Hermione: Alright... okay

463
00:22:06,133 --> 00:22:06,853
Dumbledore?

464
00:22:06,853 --> 00:22:08,093
Yes Granger?

465
00:22:08,283 --> 00:22:11,903
I need to talk to you for a moment. It's about the House Cup tournament

466
00:22:11,903 --> 00:22:15,443
Um... well first of all, I think it's an awful idea, but um

467
00:22:15,443 --> 00:22:18,403
Second of all, I don't think Harry Potter should compete

468
00:22:18,403 --> 00:22:21,263
Granger why do you always gotta be such a big ol' stick in the mud, huh?

469
00:22:21,263 --> 00:22:23,263
Pray, tell me why Harry Potter should not compete

470
00:22:23,263 --> 00:22:26,103
Uh... because he- wants to study

471
00:22:26,423 --> 00:22:28,783
Granger, nobody studies at Hogwarts except for you

472
00:22:29,493 --> 00:22:32,113
Uh, okay well he- he wants to focus on the O.W.L.s

473
00:22:32,113 --> 00:22:36,313
Why couldn't Harry have told me this himself? He thinks I'm cool

474
00:22:36,313 --> 00:22:37,523
We're tight!

475
00:22:37,523 --> 00:22:39,313
Ahh... Profess-

476
00:22:39,403 --> 00:22:41,133
I'm a really bad liar, okay? I-

477
00:22:41,133 --> 00:22:43,173
I think it's a ruse. A set up

478
00:22:43,173 --> 00:22:46,073
And I even think Snape might be trying to kill Harry Potter

479
00:22:46,123 --> 00:22:48,883
Dumbledore: Severus Snape is one of the kindest, bravest, gentlest,

480
00:22:48,883 --> 00:22:50,763
sexiest men I have ever met

481
00:22:53,593 --> 00:22:57,563
Severus Snape is trying to kill Harry Potter just about as much as he's trying to kill me

482
00:22:57,643 --> 00:22:58,333
Huh?

483
00:22:58,333 --> 00:23:00,673
Snape: Oh why Professor Dumbledore...

484
00:23:01,103 --> 00:23:03,553
I just happened to be in the kitchen and I made you this

485
00:23:03,763 --> 00:23:05,193
delicious sandwich...

486
00:23:06,383 --> 00:23:10,673
Why thank you Severus! Do you see, Granger? How thoughtful

487
00:23:11,203 --> 00:23:12,083
Here you are Professor

488
00:23:12,823 --> 00:23:13,673
Bomb-appetit

489
00:23:13,673 --> 00:23:14,703
I mean-

490
00:23:14,933 --> 00:23:16,703
Bon appetit...

491
00:23:20,303 --> 00:23:22,673
Um... is that sandwich ticking?

492
00:23:22,673 --> 00:23:24,503
It looks like it's licking

493
00:23:24,503 --> 00:23:26,343
Finger-licking good

494
00:23:27,043 --> 00:23:28,893
Professor, I don't think you should eat that sandwich!

495
00:23:28,893 --> 00:23:30,733
Come on Granger, you gotta listen to Snape more often

496
00:23:30,733 --> 00:23:32,773
You might even get a sandwich out of it, I don't know

497
00:23:33,433 --> 00:23:34,463
Dumbledore: Granger, what the hell-?

498
00:23:34,993 --> 00:23:36,463
Granger, what are you doing!?

499
00:23:36,613 --> 00:23:38,533
You dog-gone exploded my sandwich!

500
00:23:38,533 --> 00:23:40,003
Hermione: I'm sorry Sir!

501
00:23:40,003 --> 00:23:42,473
Hey, even if I did believe that Harry Potter was in danger

502
00:23:42,473 --> 00:23:44,303
He has to compete! You see that cup?

503
00:23:44,303 --> 00:23:44,583
Hermione: Yes!

504
00:23:44,583 --> 00:23:45,693
It's enchanted

505
00:23:45,923 --> 00:23:49,533
Whoever's name comes out of the cup has to compete or the results would be bad

506
00:23:49,723 --> 00:23:50,723
What do you mean bad?

507
00:23:50,723 --> 00:23:54,583
Well, try to imagine your entire life stopping instantaneously

508
00:23:54,583 --> 00:23:57,733
and every molecule in your body exploding at the speed of light

509
00:23:57,733 --> 00:23:59,293
A total plutonic reversal!

510
00:23:59,293 --> 00:24:01,533
Yeah... so you see he has to compete

511
00:24:01,533 --> 00:24:03,853
then- Hermione if it makes you feel any better

512
00:24:03,853 --> 00:24:05,983
the last guy who died in the tournament was a Hufflepuff

513
00:24:05,983 --> 00:24:07,983
So um...

514
00:24:07,983 --> 00:24:11,423
I'll keep my eyes open, and nothing's gonna get past ol' Dumbledore

515
00:24:12,553 --> 00:24:13,253
Alright

516
00:24:14,023 --> 00:24:15,963
I gotta go make myself another sandwich

517
00:24:15,963 --> 00:24:18,153
although I don't know how it's gonna be as good as the last one

518
00:24:18,243 --> 00:24:19,623
The last one ticked!

519
00:24:20,373 --> 00:24:22,163
Because it was a bomb...

520
00:24:23,013 --> 00:24:24,743
Harry, I'm so sorry but-

521
00:24:24,743 --> 00:24:27,423
I-I think you're going to have to compete in the House Cup tournament

522
00:24:27,423 --> 00:24:31,283
But don't worry. I won't rest until I found out what the first task is gonna be

523
00:24:31,283 --> 00:24:34,293
And I'll sabotage all the other champions so you win by default

524
00:24:34,293 --> 00:24:36,063
Alright, awesome

525
00:24:39,513 --> 00:24:40,833
Draco: Well...

526
00:24:40,833 --> 00:24:42,983
Isn't this touching?

527
00:24:42,983 --> 00:24:45,163
Oh my God just butt out, Malfoy

528
00:24:50,813 --> 00:24:52,983
Goyle and I have a bet, you know

529
00:24:53,453 --> 00:24:55,993
He says you won't last five minutes in this tournament

530
00:24:56,753 --> 00:24:58,353
I disagree

531
00:25:00,313 --> 00:25:02,723
I say you won't last five minutes...

532
00:25:02,723 --> 00:25:04,263
at Pigfarts!

533
00:25:04,263 --> 00:25:05,863
What? Alright, Malfoy, what-

534
00:25:05,863 --> 00:25:07,503
What is Pigfarts?

535
00:25:07,863 --> 00:25:10,163
Oh! Never heard of it?

536
00:25:10,163 --> 00:25:12,163
Hah, figures...

537
00:25:12,313 --> 00:25:15,113
Famous Potter doesn't even know about Pigfarts

538
00:25:16,733 --> 00:25:18,713
Malfoy, don't act like you don't want to talk about it

539
00:25:18,713 --> 00:25:21,763
That's like the ninth time you've mentioned Pigfarts. What is Pigfarts?

540
00:25:22,183 --> 00:25:26,113
Pigfarts is only the greatest wizarding school in the galaxy

541
00:25:26,623 --> 00:25:28,683
It's where I'm being transferred next year

542
00:25:28,683 --> 00:25:30,793
Hermione: Malfoy, I've never heard of that

543
00:25:31,013 --> 00:25:33,393
Draco: That's because Pigfarts...

544
00:25:33,573 --> 00:25:35,593
is on Mars

545
00:25:36,833 --> 00:25:39,113
Harry: Malfoy, you know, we're trying to have a conversation here

546
00:25:39,113 --> 00:25:40,073
so you could just leave us alone

547
00:25:40,073 --> 00:25:42,073
Oh! No, I'm not even here

548
00:25:42,073 --> 00:25:45,293
So anyways, I think we could out what the first task from Dumbledore

549
00:25:45,293 --> 00:25:46,653
Draco: Dumbledore! Pfft!

550
00:25:46,743 --> 00:25:48,083
What an old coot!

551
00:25:48,083 --> 00:25:50,083
He's nothing like Rumbleroar!

552
00:25:50,083 --> 00:25:52,083
Goyle: RUMBLEROAR!

553
00:25:53,003 --> 00:25:54,083
Harry: Anyway, like I was saying-

554
00:25:54,083 --> 00:25:56,373
Draco: Rumbleroar is the headmaster at Pigfarts

555
00:25:57,423 --> 00:25:58,443
He's a lion...

556
00:25:58,443 --> 00:26:00,443
who can talk

557
00:26:01,423 --> 00:26:05,133
Malfoy, if you don't mind we're trying to have a conversation here

558
00:26:05,133 --> 00:26:07,133
it's not like- you're not even eating. Get out of here!

559
00:26:07,133 --> 00:26:11,273
Well I can't help it if we can hear everything you say. We're the only ones in here

560
00:26:11,273 --> 00:26:14,323
Well just- come on Malfoy. Just get out of here, please?

561
00:26:14,323 --> 00:26:16,323
Draco: Where are we supposed to go?

562
00:26:16,433 --> 00:26:18,583
Harry: Uh, I don't know, uh, Pigfarts

563
00:26:21,123 --> 00:26:22,743
Now you're just being cute

564
00:26:22,933 --> 00:26:25,233
I can't go to Pigfarts

565
00:26:25,573 --> 00:26:27,683
It's on Mars

566
00:26:28,203 --> 00:26:29,923
You need a rocketship

567
00:26:30,393 --> 00:26:32,353
Do you have a rocketship, Potter?

568
00:26:32,843 --> 00:26:34,353
Bet you do!

569
00:26:34,353 --> 00:26:36,233
You know not all of us inherited

570
00:26:36,233 --> 00:26:40,153
enough money to buy out NASA when our parents die

571
00:26:43,203 --> 00:26:45,873
Look at this! Look at this

572
00:26:45,873 --> 00:26:48,283
Look it- Rocketship Potter!

573
00:26:49,923 --> 00:26:51,623
Starkid Potter

574
00:26:51,623 --> 00:26:53,113
Moonshoes Potter

575
00:26:53,333 --> 00:26:57,873
Traversing the galaxy for intergalactic travels to Pigfarts

576
00:26:59,253 --> 00:27:02,243
Harry: Alright that's it. This is the most misguided way to try to make me feel jealous

577
00:27:02,243 --> 00:27:04,093
I don't care if you make fun of me

578
00:27:04,093 --> 00:27:06,093
but if you bring my parents into this, it's a whole other story

579
00:27:06,093 --> 00:27:07,353
Draco: Whoa! Not so fast- Potter!

580
00:27:07,353 --> 00:27:08,633
Oh Crabbe! Goyle!

581
00:27:08,633 --> 00:27:09,803
Harry: Oh sure just behind- just

582
00:27:09,803 --> 00:27:10,633
Goyle: BACK OFF NERD!
Harry: Oh sure just behind- just

583
00:27:10,633 --> 00:27:11,253
Goyle: BACK OFF NERD!

584
00:27:11,253 --> 00:27:13,253
Harry: Whoa! Scared, scared!

585
00:27:13,683 --> 00:27:15,733
Not so tough now, are you, Potter?

586
00:27:17,113 --> 00:27:20,143
Maybe you should hang out with someone better than that lollygagging Ginger

587
00:27:20,143 --> 00:27:22,143
and his stupid Mudblood girlfriend

588
00:27:22,363 --> 00:27:24,873
Hermione: Oh that is it, Malfoy!

589
00:27:24,873 --> 00:27:26,003
Jelly-legs Jinx!

590
00:27:26,003 --> 00:27:26,983
Draco: Oh come on

591
00:27:26,983 --> 00:27:29,503
Goyle: Hey no fair our legs are jelly!

592
00:27:31,573 --> 00:27:32,953
Take it back Malfoy!

593
00:27:32,953 --> 00:27:33,933
Draco: Take what back?

594
00:27:33,933 --> 00:27:36,623
Take back what you said about your stupid made-up space school

595
00:27:36,623 --> 00:27:38,543
Ron: Yeah and all that stuff about Hermione being my girlfriend

596
00:27:38,543 --> 00:27:40,093
that's not even a little bit true

597
00:27:41,523 --> 00:27:44,083
Hermione: And say you're sorry for calling me a you-know-what!

598
00:27:44,293 --> 00:27:44,993
Malfoy: I'm sorry!

599
00:27:44,993 --> 00:27:46,443
And you promise you'll never do it again?

600
00:27:46,553 --> 00:27:47,533
I promise!

601
00:27:47,533 --> 00:27:48,343
Hermione: Alright

602
00:27:48,773 --> 00:27:51,713
Now next time we tell you to leave us alone you better do it

603
00:27:52,313 --> 00:27:54,423
Come on Harry, Ron, let's get out of here

604
00:27:54,783 --> 00:27:57,003
Besides you... already ate all my lunch

605
00:27:57,003 --> 00:27:58,273
Harry: Wow, thanks Hermione

606
00:27:58,273 --> 00:27:58,873
Hermione: Yeah

607
00:27:58,873 --> 00:27:59,683
Unjellify!

608
00:28:01,153 --> 00:28:03,713
Ron: Wow that was like the most badass thing I've ever seen

609
00:28:03,713 --> 00:28:06,933
Too bad no one was here to see it though. It was like an outburst of pent-up aggression

610
00:28:06,933 --> 00:28:08,933
It was like ARGHH HERMIONE!

611
00:28:11,173 --> 00:28:11,983
Wow...

612
00:28:12,413 --> 00:28:14,773
That sucked royal Hippogriff!

613
00:28:16,313 --> 00:28:19,443
We got beat by a girl, who is a nerd

614
00:28:21,423 --> 00:28:23,303
Draco: I didn't mean what I said, you know

615
00:28:23,903 --> 00:28:25,203
Pigfarts is real

616
00:28:27,113 --> 00:28:28,903
Am I... am I bleeding?

617
00:28:31,333 --> 00:28:31,853
Goyle?

618
00:28:35,283 --> 00:28:36,133
No!

619
00:28:38,333 --> 00:28:40,293
I thought maybe it was

620
00:28:40,673 --> 00:28:42,293
m-maybe it was a little bit

621
00:28:47,923 --> 00:28:50,163
I've never been pushed down like that by a girl

622
00:28:51,563 --> 00:28:53,573
Maybe I shouldn't call her a Mud-

623
00:28:54,823 --> 00:28:55,443
Whatever

624
00:28:57,623 --> 00:29:01,883
I can't believe I couldn't figure out the counter-curse was just Unjellify

625
00:29:03,903 --> 00:29:06,483
Draco: Right, well I'm not surprised

626
00:29:06,803 --> 00:29:09,103
Come on let's go watch <i>Wizards of Waverly Place</i>

627
00:29:17,784 --> 00:29:18,854
Quirrell: Fools!

628
00:29:18,854 --> 00:29:20,454
They're all fools

629
00:29:20,454 --> 00:29:22,344
They think they're safe

630
00:29:22,344 --> 00:29:26,334
They think they're back for another fun year of learning shenanigans at Hogwarts

631
00:29:27,124 --> 00:29:30,784
Little do they know the danger that's lurking right under their noses

632
00:29:31,664 --> 00:29:34,074
Or should I say, on the back

633
00:29:34,074 --> 00:29:36,224
of their heads?

634
00:29:46,094 --> 00:29:49,164
Voldemort: I can't breathe in that damn turban!

635
00:29:49,164 --> 00:29:52,334
I'm sorry my Lord, it's a necessary precaution

636
00:29:52,334 --> 00:29:54,344
for if they knew that you lived

637
00:29:54,344 --> 00:29:56,964
That when Harry Potter destroyed you, your soul lived on

638
00:29:56,964 --> 00:30:02,104
Yes, that when my body was destroyed I was forced to live in the Forbidden Forest

639
00:30:02,104 --> 00:30:04,834
eating bugs and mushrooms and- ugh

640
00:30:04,834 --> 00:30:06,194
unicorn blood

641
00:30:06,194 --> 00:30:06,704
Quirrel: Until I found you and let you attach yourself to my soul
unicorn blood

642
00:30:06,704 --> 00:30:09,304
Quirrel: Until I found you and let you attach yourself to my soul

643
00:30:09,304 --> 00:30:12,164
Yes, nobody must know any of that

644
00:30:12,954 --> 00:30:14,164
Now...

645
00:30:14,694 --> 00:30:16,364
Quirrell!

646
00:30:16,444 --> 00:30:18,364
Get me some water!

647
00:30:22,584 --> 00:30:23,844
Now Quirrell!

648
00:30:24,504 --> 00:30:26,014
Pour it in my mouth!

649
00:30:39,104 --> 00:30:42,004
Your plan to infiltrate Hogwarts on the back of my head

650
00:30:42,044 --> 00:30:44,174
is going swimmingly, my liege

651
00:30:44,174 --> 00:30:46,174
Yes, yes, yes I'm done with the water!

652
00:30:53,134 --> 00:30:56,734
We must not have anymore foul ups like tonight in the Great Hall

653
00:30:56,924 --> 00:30:58,854
I'm sorry my Lord, you sneezed

654
00:30:58,894 --> 00:31:00,824
Voldemort: I know that!

655
00:31:01,084 --> 00:31:03,424
Get me some Nasonex, you swine!

656
00:31:13,804 --> 00:31:15,594
Wash that turban!

657
00:31:15,594 --> 00:31:17,624
It tickles my nose

658
00:31:17,624 --> 00:31:19,024
Quirrel: Yes my Dark King...

659
00:31:19,024 --> 00:31:20,094
Voldemort: Okay, just

660
00:31:20,094 --> 00:31:22,804
relax with the Dark King, okay? I...

661
00:31:22,804 --> 00:31:25,354
I watch you wipe your butt daily

662
00:31:26,164 --> 00:31:28,514
You can call me Voldemort, we're there

663
00:31:29,574 --> 00:31:31,564
We've reached that point

664
00:31:35,204 --> 00:31:36,524
Yes, yes my

665
00:31:36,614 --> 00:31:37,704
Voldemort

666
00:31:38,634 --> 00:31:40,134
Now Quirrell

667
00:31:40,624 --> 00:31:42,094
Get us ready for bed

668
00:31:43,474 --> 00:31:47,204
We must be well rested if we wish to kill Potter

669
00:31:48,654 --> 00:31:50,914
Tonight in the Great Hall

670
00:31:50,914 --> 00:31:52,664
He was so close

671
00:31:52,664 --> 00:31:54,664
I could have touched him

672
00:31:54,664 --> 00:31:57,034
Revenge is at my fingertips, Quirrell

673
00:31:57,284 --> 00:31:58,674
I can taste it

674
00:31:59,014 --> 00:32:00,674
It tastes like...

675
00:32:00,674 --> 00:32:01,854
Cool mint

676
00:32:01,854 --> 00:32:03,854
Quirrell: That's our Listerine, Voldemort

677
00:32:04,154 --> 00:32:06,494
Yes, excellent

678
00:32:07,564 --> 00:32:10,444
Well, er... goodnight Quirrell

679
00:32:13,914 --> 00:32:15,084
Quirrell: Goodnight

680
00:32:26,814 --> 00:32:28,664
Okay, okay, I can't do this

681
00:32:29,094 --> 00:32:30,374
You gotta roll over

682
00:32:30,374 --> 00:32:32,094
I can't sleep on my tummy

683
00:32:33,264 --> 00:32:35,894
Quirrell: I always sleep on my back, I have back troubles

684
00:32:35,894 --> 00:32:37,124
it's the only way I'm comfortable

685
00:32:37,124 --> 00:32:39,574
Voldemort: You roll over right now or I'll

686
00:32:39,964 --> 00:32:41,264
I'll eat your pillow!

687
00:32:41,394 --> 00:32:44,034
You'll be having a dream that you're eating a giant marshmallow

688
00:32:44,034 --> 00:32:47,824
but really you'll wake up, and your favorite goose feather pillow will be missing

689
00:32:49,384 --> 00:32:52,114
Quirrell: Fine, we'll compromise. We'll sleep on our sides

690
00:32:52,704 --> 00:32:54,714
Okay I guess I can do this

691
00:32:54,944 --> 00:32:56,714
Quirrell: Now goodnight

692
00:32:57,394 --> 00:32:58,504
Goodnight Quirrell

693
00:33:08,804 --> 00:33:09,974
Hey Quirrell

694
00:33:11,744 --> 00:33:14,534
How long have those robes been on that chair?

695
00:33:15,494 --> 00:33:18,644
Quirrell: I think they're from last night. I just put them there for now

696
00:33:20,094 --> 00:33:22,204
Well are you planning on putting them in a hamper?

697
00:33:22,204 --> 00:33:23,974
What's your plan for these?

698
00:33:24,914 --> 00:33:28,794
I figured I'd just leave them there for now and maybe put them away in the morning, okay?

699
00:33:30,244 --> 00:33:31,014
No!

700
00:33:31,014 --> 00:33:33,544
No, no that's not okay

701
00:33:33,544 --> 00:33:36,664
I can't go to sleep knowing that there are dirty clothes on that chair

702
00:33:37,124 --> 00:33:39,344
The chair's going to start to smell like dirty clothes

703
00:33:39,644 --> 00:33:42,014
Quirrell: Look, I promise I'll put them away in the morning

704
00:33:42,354 --> 00:33:45,374
You put them away right now!

705
00:33:45,824 --> 00:33:48,314
I command you to get up and

706
00:33:48,534 --> 00:33:50,314
fold them at least!

707
00:33:50,604 --> 00:33:52,564
Make it into a neat pile

708
00:33:54,244 --> 00:33:57,034
Look, if we're going to be in this situation for a while

709
00:33:57,034 --> 00:33:58,934
we're going to have to live with each other

710
00:33:59,194 --> 00:34:02,514
Now I've been single for all of my life and I have some habits

711
00:34:02,514 --> 00:34:04,644
and sometimes I leave laundry around

712
00:34:04,794 --> 00:34:07,954
Well I believe that everything has its place

713
00:34:08,464 --> 00:34:10,124
Muggles have their place

714
00:34:10,444 --> 00:34:13,104
Mudbloods have their place

715
00:34:13,104 --> 00:34:15,584
and so do your clothes!

716
00:34:16,024 --> 00:34:17,584
Namely, a dresser!

717
00:34:17,864 --> 00:34:18,604
Quirrel: Well

718
00:34:18,604 --> 00:34:20,274
Aren't we an odd couple?

719
00:34:23,404 --> 00:34:25,624
You won't sleep on your tummy

720
00:34:25,624 --> 00:34:27,854
You won't sleep on your back

721
00:34:28,204 --> 00:34:31,884
We're quite a kooky couple you'll agree

722
00:34:32,894 --> 00:34:35,724
We share some hands and fingers

723
00:34:36,084 --> 00:34:40,474
and yet the feeling lingers...

724
00:34:40,474 --> 00:34:48,454
We're just about as different as anyone can be

725
00:34:49,854 --> 00:34:52,434
You like planting a garden

726
00:34:53,014 --> 00:34:56,104
and I like plotting to kill

727
00:34:56,104 --> 00:34:59,024
You think that you should rule the world

728
00:34:59,404 --> 00:35:01,874
I think books are a thrill!

729
00:35:01,874 --> 00:35:04,844
Sipping tea by the fire is swell

730
00:35:04,844 --> 00:35:07,184
Voldemort: Pushing people in is fun as well!

731
00:35:07,974 --> 00:35:10,214
I like folding all of my ties

732
00:35:10,214 --> 00:35:12,774
And you have no friends. Hey! That's a surprise

733
00:35:13,344 --> 00:35:17,824
I guess it's plain to see, when you look at you and me

734
00:35:17,824 --> 00:35:21,684
We're different, different, as can be

735
00:35:23,964 --> 00:35:26,564
You're a sissy, a twat, a girl!

736
00:35:26,754 --> 00:35:29,464
I'm the darkest of lords

737
00:35:29,464 --> 00:35:32,144
Quirrell: I'm the brightest professor here

738
00:35:32,144 --> 00:35:34,574
I've won several awards!

739
00:35:34,704 --> 00:35:37,474
Voldemort: My new world's about to unfold

740
00:35:37,474 --> 00:35:39,904
You got beat by a two year old

741
00:35:40,094 --> 00:35:42,824
I'll kill him this time, through and through

742
00:35:42,824 --> 00:35:45,064
Quirrell: Or you might just give him another tattoo

743
00:35:45,364 --> 00:35:49,924
You really must agree, when you look at you and me

744
00:35:50,174 --> 00:35:53,264
We're different, different, as can-

745
00:35:53,264 --> 00:35:58,644
I'll rise again and I'll rule the world!

746
00:35:58,744 --> 00:36:03,014
but you must help me renew

747
00:36:04,164 --> 00:36:06,254
For when our plan succeeds

748
00:36:06,254 --> 00:36:07,444
Quirrell: Prevails!

749
00:36:07,444 --> 00:36:10,554
part of that world goes to you

750
00:36:10,554 --> 00:36:15,094
When I rule the world, I'll plant flowers

751
00:36:16,204 --> 00:36:19,014
When I rule the world, I'll have

752
00:36:19,014 --> 00:36:20,594
Snakes!

753
00:36:21,344 --> 00:36:24,284
Quirrel: And Jane Austin noooooovels!
Voldemort: And goblins, and werewolves, a fleet of dementors

754
00:36:24,284 --> 00:36:28,114
and giants, and thestrals, and all my Death Eaters!
Quirrel: And Jane Austin noooooovels!

755
00:36:28,394 --> 00:36:31,104
When I rule the

756
00:36:31,104 --> 00:36:35,684
World!

757
00:36:50,695 --> 00:36:54,155
Harry, don't you think you should try and figure out what the first task is going to be?

758
00:36:54,155 --> 00:36:57,135
You can actually die if you're not ready

759
00:36:57,545 --> 00:36:58,415
What?

760
00:36:59,245 --> 00:37:01,105
Come on...

761
00:37:01,635 --> 00:37:03,165
I mean, can't you just do it for me?

762
00:37:03,165 --> 00:37:05,935
Can't you just prepare all of my stuff for me? I mean- what are you doing right now?

763
00:37:06,045 --> 00:37:07,935
I'm writing your Potions essay

764
00:37:08,285 --> 00:37:10,775
Oh well do that first, 'cause that's due tomorrow so...

765
00:37:11,505 --> 00:37:13,185
But after that, after that can you

766
00:37:13,185 --> 00:37:14,655
prepare for the first task? Please?

767
00:37:14,655 --> 00:37:16,615
Thank you. You are the best

768
00:37:17,255 --> 00:37:18,615
You got it. Thanks Hermione

769
00:37:22,095 --> 00:37:23,925
Hey Ginny, come here. I wanna show you something

770
00:37:23,925 --> 00:37:24,715
Come here

771
00:37:25,335 --> 00:37:27,255
Hey, Harry Potter

772
00:37:29,255 --> 00:37:31,245
Listen, I wanna play this song that I'm working on

773
00:37:31,245 --> 00:37:35,295
I met this girl that I really, really like and I want to let her know that she's really special

774
00:37:35,925 --> 00:37:37,505
So- well I just wanna know what you think

775
00:37:37,505 --> 00:37:40,965
just for the purposes of now, 'cause I'm still working out the lyrics, I'll put your name

776
00:37:41,275 --> 00:37:42,495
where her name should be

777
00:37:42,495 --> 00:37:44,815
But I don't think it's really gonna work out

778
00:37:44,815 --> 00:37:46,485
because, well, just let me give it a shot

779
00:37:48,315 --> 00:37:51,835
You're tall and fun and pretty, you're really, really skinny

780
00:37:52,295 --> 00:37:53,475
Ginny

781
00:37:54,305 --> 00:37:57,755
I'm the Mickey to your Minnie, you're the Tigger to my Winnie

782
00:37:58,355 --> 00:37:59,695
Ginny

783
00:37:59,935 --> 00:38:01,695
I wanna take you to the city

784
00:38:01,695 --> 00:38:03,695
Gonna take you out to dinny

785
00:38:04,025 --> 00:38:05,695
Ginny

786
00:38:06,175 --> 00:38:08,265
You're cuter than a guinea pig

787
00:38:08,795 --> 00:38:10,655
Wanna take you up to Winnipeg

788
00:38:10,655 --> 00:38:12,655
That's in Canada!

789
00:38:14,215 --> 00:38:15,345
Ginny, Ginny, Ginny

790
00:38:15,345 --> 00:38:17,155
You know what? This doesn't work with your name at all

791
00:38:17,155 --> 00:38:17,985
Doesn't work

792
00:38:19,545 --> 00:38:20,285
But I don't know. Wh-

793
00:38:20,285 --> 00:38:22,285
How does that make you feel? Emotionally?

794
00:38:22,805 --> 00:38:24,165
Wow...

795
00:38:24,485 --> 00:38:26,835
Wowie, Harry Potter

796
00:38:26,835 --> 00:38:27,235
Don't you think it could uh, I don't know
Wowie, Harry Potter

797
00:38:27,235 --> 00:38:28,945
Don't you think it could uh, I don't know

798
00:38:28,945 --> 00:38:30,755
Make a girl fall in love with me?

799
00:38:30,755 --> 00:38:32,755
Aw I think it already has

800
00:38:33,695 --> 00:38:34,225
Awesome!

801
00:38:34,225 --> 00:38:36,225
'Cause it's for Cho Chang!

802
00:38:37,805 --> 00:38:38,915
Oh yeah...

803
00:38:39,575 --> 00:38:41,555
S-she's beautiful

804
00:38:41,555 --> 00:38:43,325
What are you, nuts? Beautiful? More like

805
00:38:43,325 --> 00:38:45,325
Supermegafoxyawesomehot

806
00:38:45,545 --> 00:38:48,635
She's the hottest girl I've ever met. She's far more attractive,

807
00:38:48,635 --> 00:38:49,575
far more appealing,

808
00:38:49,575 --> 00:38:51,725
far more interesting than any girl, that I know

809
00:38:51,725 --> 00:38:53,705
In my immediate group of- of friends

810
00:38:54,625 --> 00:38:56,565
She's a lot more better, and awesome

811
00:39:00,405 --> 00:39:01,465
Ron: Sup Neville?

812
00:39:02,385 --> 00:39:05,515
Move, move, move, move, move, move move

813
00:39:05,775 --> 00:39:06,515
Awesome

814
00:39:06,515 --> 00:39:09,265
Hey Harry what's up? So I was just offstage hanging out with Hagrid

815
00:39:09,395 --> 00:39:12,165
and I was, uh, I saw these delivery wizards

816
00:39:12,165 --> 00:39:15,105
Bringing giant cages into the dungeon

817
00:39:15,105 --> 00:39:15,965
I dunno what that's for

818
00:39:15,965 --> 00:39:17,965
Hermione: Giant cages?

819
00:39:18,115 --> 00:39:20,995
I bet that whatever is in those cages has something to do with the first task!

820
00:39:21,205 --> 00:39:22,935
Harry we have to find out what it is

821
00:39:23,105 --> 00:39:23,525
Hey

822
00:39:24,185 --> 00:39:26,155
Hey, guys, chill

823
00:39:26,155 --> 00:39:27,345
I'm busy

824
00:39:31,455 --> 00:39:34,995
Ron: Nooo! Nooo! Nooo!
Ginny: No! No! No! No! No! No! No!

825
00:39:34,995 --> 00:39:36,295
Ron: Whoa! Whoa!
Ginny: No! No! No! No! No! No! No!

826
00:39:38,425 --> 00:39:39,455
Hermione: Guys

827
00:39:39,555 --> 00:39:40,325
Now listen

828
00:39:40,325 --> 00:39:43,055
This could be a matter of life and death!

829
00:39:43,055 --> 00:39:46,035
Ron: Well it doesn't matter because it's after hours, okay?

830
00:39:46,105 --> 00:39:47,785
We can't leave Gryffindor house

831
00:39:48,045 --> 00:39:49,595
We'll probably get in trouble if we do

832
00:39:49,665 --> 00:39:50,645
And even if we do

833
00:39:50,645 --> 00:39:52,685
Schlongbottom over there will probably tell on us

834
00:39:52,775 --> 00:39:54,245
Hermione: Neville won't tell

835
00:39:54,245 --> 00:39:56,035
Neville: Oh yes I certainly will!

836
00:39:58,035 --> 00:39:59,505
Ron: Well what're we gonna do?

837
00:39:59,505 --> 00:40:00,915
Hermione: It's simple guys

838
00:40:00,915 --> 00:40:01,935
The cloak

839
00:40:01,935 --> 00:40:02,915
Of course

840
00:40:03,455 --> 00:40:04,625
The cloak

841
00:40:06,225 --> 00:40:06,995
Ginny: Wait what cloak?

842
00:40:06,995 --> 00:40:07,395
Shut up!

843
00:40:11,955 --> 00:40:13,535
Harry: I got a present- I got a present last year

844
00:40:13,535 --> 00:40:14,175
Oh bye Neville

845
00:40:14,175 --> 00:40:16,685
I got a present last year. First year of Hogwarts

846
00:40:16,685 --> 00:40:20,035
and uh... well, it was left to me by my dad

847
00:40:20,165 --> 00:40:21,805
The dad that's dead. My father is dead

848
00:40:21,805 --> 00:40:22,655
My dead father

849
00:40:24,855 --> 00:40:27,665
Used to solve mysteries and stuff. My Invisibility Cloak!

850
00:40:29,265 --> 00:40:30,205
Ginny: Wow!

851
00:40:30,205 --> 00:40:33,315
Oooh boy, wowie Harry Potter!

852
00:40:34,935 --> 00:40:36,175
A real Invisibility Cloak!

853
00:40:36,175 --> 00:40:37,495
Oh! Oh! Oh! Oh!

854
00:40:37,495 --> 00:40:40,285
Do you know what I would do if I had an Invisibility Cloak?

855
00:40:40,345 --> 00:40:41,815
Oh man I would- I would kick, uh

856
00:40:41,815 --> 00:40:42,565
I would kick wiener dogs

857
00:40:42,565 --> 00:40:45,485
And I would pretend to be a ghost and I would scare mean people

858
00:40:45,935 --> 00:40:48,965
I'd use it to avoid ever having to face my reflection in the mirror

859
00:40:51,835 --> 00:40:52,415
Harry: That's a bummer

860
00:40:52,415 --> 00:40:53,475
Ron: Jesus, what's wrong with you?

861
00:40:54,585 --> 00:40:57,575
Well, actually, I was gonna say that I would use it to

862
00:40:57,575 --> 00:41:00,365
fake my own death and watch people cry at the funeral

863
00:41:00,365 --> 00:41:03,245
Okay anyway, let's get out of here before Neville gets out of the bathroom

864
00:41:03,245 --> 00:41:04,435
Alright? Let's get out of here

865
00:41:04,605 --> 00:41:07,395
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa where do you think you're going?

866
00:41:07,395 --> 00:41:08,525
Ginny: Um... with you guys

867
00:41:08,525 --> 00:41:10,705
No, no, no way. No kid sisters allowed

868
00:41:10,705 --> 00:41:11,215
Okay?

869
00:41:13,575 --> 00:41:16,945
Besides, there's only enough room under this cloak for two people

870
00:41:16,945 --> 00:41:18,735
So uh...

871
00:41:18,735 --> 00:41:19,845
Come on Hermione, come on

872
00:41:28,305 --> 00:41:31,445
The way his hair falls in his eyes

873
00:41:31,915 --> 00:41:34,365
Makes me wonder if he'll...

874
00:41:34,975 --> 00:41:38,365
Ever see through my disguise

875
00:41:38,735 --> 00:41:41,285
And I'm under his spell

876
00:41:41,285 --> 00:41:46,515
Everything is falling, and I don't know where to land

877
00:41:46,665 --> 00:41:49,535
Everyone knows who he is

878
00:41:49,925 --> 00:41:54,125
But they don't know who I am

879
00:41:55,955 --> 00:42:00,115
Harry

880
00:42:02,755 --> 00:42:06,675
Harry

881
00:42:09,085 --> 00:42:14,025
Why can't you see?

882
00:42:15,625 --> 00:42:19,955
What you're doing to me?

883
00:42:21,855 --> 00:42:25,325
I've seen you conquer certain death

884
00:42:26,155 --> 00:42:29,525
Even when you're just standing there

885
00:42:29,525 --> 00:42:32,255
You take away my breath

886
00:42:33,085 --> 00:42:34,615
And maybe

887
00:42:34,615 --> 00:42:38,525
Someday you'll hear my song and understand

888
00:42:38,525 --> 00:42:40,075
That all along

889
00:42:40,075 --> 00:42:47,745
There's something more, that I'm trying to say!

890
00:42:48,555 --> 00:42:49,515
When I say

891
00:42:49,515 --> 00:42:53,995
Harry

892
00:42:56,045 --> 00:43:00,645
Harry

893
00:43:02,205 --> 00:43:06,995
Why can't you see?

894
00:43:08,805 --> 00:43:14,265
What you're doing to me?

895
00:43:16,485 --> 00:43:20,105
What you're doing

896
00:43:20,105 --> 00:43:23,045
to me?

897
00:43:27,106 --> 00:43:31,326
Quirrell: Master! Master! The shipments for the first task of the tournament have just arrived!

898
00:43:31,326 --> 00:43:32,756
Voldemort: Yes I know Quirrell

899
00:43:32,756 --> 00:43:35,436
I hear everything that you hear

900
00:43:37,336 --> 00:43:38,466
Isn't it wonderful now?

901
00:43:38,466 --> 00:43:42,686
Well we made sure Harry Potter's name was drawn from the cup and soon he will be ours

902
00:43:42,686 --> 00:43:43,856
Yes

903
00:43:44,686 --> 00:43:46,846
It's really happening, isn't it Quirrell?

904
00:43:47,526 --> 00:43:50,616
You know, with the plan going so well

905
00:43:50,616 --> 00:43:52,856
I feel maybe we should celebrate

906
00:43:53,536 --> 00:43:56,516
What do you say Quirrell? How's about we go out?

907
00:43:56,946 --> 00:43:59,486
I hear it's karaoke night down at the Hog's Head

908
00:44:00,936 --> 00:44:01,996
Uh I don't know

909
00:44:02,336 --> 00:44:05,086
I have all these papers to grade, and I've been giving so much

910
00:44:05,086 --> 00:44:07,796
attention to this revenge plan that I'm really behind

911
00:44:07,796 --> 00:44:09,886
Ah come on Quirrell!

912
00:44:10,206 --> 00:44:12,506
You've been working so hard all year

913
00:44:12,506 --> 00:44:14,296
You deserve a night off

914
00:44:14,386 --> 00:44:15,486
But the papers...

915
00:44:15,706 --> 00:44:18,266
Oh just give them all B minuses and be done with it

916
00:44:19,666 --> 00:44:20,526
Now that's evil

917
00:44:21,476 --> 00:44:23,756
Yeah, thanks, I am the Dark Lord

918
00:44:25,256 --> 00:44:28,576
Come on, just a few drinks

919
00:44:28,576 --> 00:44:30,586
Hey we'll try to pick up some chicks

920
00:44:31,026 --> 00:44:33,436
I wouldn't know what to say. I'm no good at that

921
00:44:33,436 --> 00:44:34,776
Come on, it'll be fun

922
00:44:34,776 --> 00:44:36,636
You just move your lips and I'll do the talking

923
00:44:38,856 --> 00:44:40,236
Quirrell

924
00:44:40,726 --> 00:44:42,236
Man!

925
00:44:42,236 --> 00:44:44,236
Listen

926
00:44:45,306 --> 00:44:48,316
I may just be a parasite on the back of your head

927
00:44:48,316 --> 00:44:51,366
that's literally devouring your soul any time you take a breath

928
00:44:51,596 --> 00:44:53,706
But I can see that

929
00:44:53,946 --> 00:44:58,526
You're too good a guy not to have a bit of fun once in a while

930
00:44:58,526 --> 00:45:00,636
You deserve this

931
00:45:01,446 --> 00:45:03,046
Well if you put it that way then

932
00:45:03,156 --> 00:45:04,836
Yeah let's just go wild tonight

933
00:45:05,536 --> 00:45:07,796
That's the spirit Quirrell!

934
00:45:08,376 --> 00:45:11,826
Put on a fresh pair of wizard shorts and grab your tunic

935
00:45:12,316 --> 00:45:14,706
Quirrell we are gonna get you laid

936
00:45:16,836 --> 00:45:19,416
Seriously man, back when I had a body

937
00:45:20,266 --> 00:45:22,736
I had mad game with the bitches

938
00:45:24,206 --> 00:45:26,086
Just ask Bellatrix Lestrange

939
00:45:32,976 --> 00:45:35,206
Ron: This cloak isn't as big as it used to be

940
00:45:35,206 --> 00:45:37,216
Hermione: Shh, someone's coming!

941
00:45:42,026 --> 00:45:43,546
Did you just hear something?

942
00:45:43,546 --> 00:45:44,416
Goyle: No

943
00:45:45,296 --> 00:45:46,416
Only quiet

944
00:45:48,166 --> 00:45:49,706
Maybe... one

945
00:45:49,916 --> 00:45:50,936
raindrop

946
00:45:53,586 --> 00:45:54,456
No matter

947
00:45:55,566 --> 00:45:56,656
Tell me, Goyle

948
00:45:57,906 --> 00:46:00,446
Who do you think is the ugliest girl in school?

949
00:46:00,856 --> 00:46:01,766
Uh...

950
00:46:03,086 --> 00:46:04,116
Oh, Buckbeak

951
00:46:04,176 --> 00:46:04,836
For sure

952
00:46:08,336 --> 00:46:08,866
Crabbe?

953
00:46:08,996 --> 00:46:10,866
Crabbe: Uh, Winky the house elf

954
00:46:11,936 --> 00:46:12,876
Good one

955
00:46:14,196 --> 00:46:15,516
Obscure

956
00:46:18,326 --> 00:46:20,886
You know who I think is the ugliest girl in school?

957
00:46:22,206 --> 00:46:24,216
That Hermione Granger

958
00:46:25,196 --> 00:46:28,136
You know what I'd give her, on a scale of one to ten?

959
00:46:28,136 --> 00:46:29,476
With one-

960
00:46:29,476 --> 00:46:32,826
One would be the ugliest and then ten the most pretty

961
00:46:32,936 --> 00:46:35,316
I would give her...

962
00:46:35,896 --> 00:46:36,746
An eight

963
00:46:45,076 --> 00:46:46,316
An eight point five

964
00:46:47,636 --> 00:46:48,806
Or a nine

965
00:46:49,366 --> 00:46:51,046
Not- not over

966
00:46:51,046 --> 00:46:51,946
A nine point eight

967
00:46:54,416 --> 00:46:56,676
Because there is always room for improvement

968
00:46:57,696 --> 00:46:59,956
Not everyone's perfect, like me

969
00:47:00,616 --> 00:47:02,776
That's why I am holding out for a ten

970
00:47:03,986 --> 00:47:05,526
Because I'm worth it

971
00:47:08,736 --> 00:47:09,976
Come on! Let's go

972
00:47:15,966 --> 00:47:17,376
Ron: Wow what a bunch of jerks

973
00:47:17,376 --> 00:47:18,336
Hermione: Alright, forget them now-

974
00:47:18,336 --> 00:47:20,766
Where did you say you saw those crates being delivered?

975
00:47:20,766 --> 00:47:23,066
Ron: Well I think they were being delivered to the auditorium

976
00:47:23,066 --> 00:47:25,406
So they should be at the end of this hallway and to the left

977
00:47:32,446 --> 00:47:33,146
Ron: Look!

978
00:47:33,146 --> 00:47:34,046
Hermione: A goat?

979
00:47:34,046 --> 00:47:35,086
Harry: A goat?

980
00:47:35,086 --> 00:47:37,836
Oh my God I have to fight a goat? I don't know if I could do that morally

981
00:47:39,666 --> 00:47:43,566
Snape: And the goats have all been sent for feeding time, headmaster

982
00:47:43,566 --> 00:47:46,196
Dumbledore: Oh feeding time? Dragons don't want to be fed

983
00:47:46,196 --> 00:47:47,066
They want to hunt!

984
00:47:47,066 --> 00:47:48,306
Harry: Did he just say dragons?

985
00:47:48,306 --> 00:47:50,536
Snape: Did you just say "did he just say dragons?"

986
00:47:51,266 --> 00:47:54,886
Dumbledore: I must have because anybody else hiding in this room

987
00:47:54,886 --> 00:47:56,886
would have known to shut up

988
00:47:56,886 --> 00:47:57,636
Potter

989
00:47:59,276 --> 00:48:03,136
Snape: Headmaster do you really think it's wise to have children fight dragons?

990
00:48:03,136 --> 00:48:05,436
No Snape I don't think it's wise to do anything anymore

991
00:48:05,436 --> 00:48:07,276
Like, here I am alive and well today

992
00:48:07,276 --> 00:48:09,616
and I could very well be killed by you, tomorrow

993
00:48:10,786 --> 00:48:11,966
Snape: Why that's absurd

994
00:48:13,966 --> 00:48:16,756
Dumbledore: First... let's go to bed

995
00:48:16,906 --> 00:48:18,396
Have you ever seen my room?

996
00:48:18,396 --> 00:48:20,616
I've got some pretty kickin' posters on my wall

997
00:48:24,216 --> 00:48:26,176
Snape: Well I am rather tired

998
00:48:29,506 --> 00:48:31,256
Harry: Aw man, I have to fight a dragon?

999
00:48:31,256 --> 00:48:32,236
This is bogus!

1000
00:48:32,236 --> 00:48:32,846
Hermione: Well...

1001
00:48:32,846 --> 00:48:34,836
Harry: How can I fight a dragon, I'm just a little kid!

1002
00:48:34,836 --> 00:48:36,986
Ron: Alright well, well maybe it won't be that bad, Harry

1003
00:48:36,986 --> 00:48:38,776
Maybe, maybe you'll just have to fight like

1004
00:48:38,776 --> 00:48:40,776
<i>Mushu</i> from <i>Mulan</i> or...

1005
00:48:42,506 --> 00:48:43,576
Ron: I dunno maybe

1006
00:48:43,786 --> 00:48:46,686
I dunno maybe like <i>Puff the Magic Dragon</i> or something...

1007
00:48:46,686 --> 00:48:48,686
Hermione: Ron, this is serious okay?

1008
00:48:48,686 --> 00:48:49,886
Harry could die!

1009
00:48:49,886 --> 00:48:53,036
Now look, there's still time, alright? We just need to figure out a plan

1010
00:48:53,186 --> 00:48:55,466
Harry: Okay well we should probably do that back in the common room

1011
00:48:55,466 --> 00:48:56,856
Where's- wait- where's the Invisibility Cloak?

1012
00:48:56,856 --> 00:48:59,146
Ron: Well I threw it over on that magical walking chair over the-

1013
00:48:59,146 --> 00:49:00,076
Oh crap

1014
00:49:00,076 --> 00:49:02,076
Harry: Oh that's... that's gonna be an issue

1015
00:49:02,076 --> 00:49:02,406
Ron: Yep

1016
00:49:11,227 --> 00:49:13,467
Quirrell: I thought walking home drunk was hard before

1017
00:49:15,387 --> 00:49:16,977
We should've realized that with

1018
00:49:17,087 --> 00:49:20,097
with both of us drinking into one belly we'd get

1019
00:49:20,097 --> 00:49:21,207
twice as drunk

1020
00:49:25,917 --> 00:49:27,217
Hey Quirrell

1021
00:49:28,447 --> 00:49:29,447
Quirrell

1022
00:49:29,557 --> 00:49:33,057
Quirrell, Quirrell, Quirrell, Quirrell

1023
00:49:33,057 --> 00:49:36,447
Quirrell, Quirrell, Quirrell you remember that girl you were talking to?

1024
00:49:36,807 --> 00:49:37,187
Yeah

1025
00:49:37,187 --> 00:49:40,987
You remember that girl we were talking to? Well I was talking to her sister

1026
00:49:40,987 --> 00:49:42,327
on my side

1027
00:49:43,437 --> 00:49:46,627
Oh so that's why she freaked out when we stood up!

1028
00:49:46,627 --> 00:49:48,657
Voldemort: Because they didn't know that we were the same person!

1029
00:49:48,657 --> 00:49:50,997
Quirrell: One person!
Voldemort: Because they didn't know that we were the same person!

1030
00:49:58,077 --> 00:50:00,507
You know I haven't had- I haven't had this much fun since

1031
00:50:00,507 --> 00:50:04,407
Nearly Headless Nick's Death Day party of '91

1032
00:50:05,747 --> 00:50:07,987
I haven't had this much fun since, ah

1033
00:50:08,497 --> 00:50:11,467
Yeah well shit I can't remember ever having this much fun

1034
00:50:13,937 --> 00:50:16,967
You never had fun... ever? Doing

1035
00:50:17,347 --> 00:50:18,857
doing anything?

1036
00:50:18,967 --> 00:50:20,867
Maybe that's why you're so evil

1037
00:50:21,647 --> 00:50:22,867
Yeah maybe

1038
00:50:24,997 --> 00:50:27,897
Definitely to do with the fact that Muggles and Mudbloods

1039
00:50:27,897 --> 00:50:30,687
make me sick to my stomach, but uh...

1040
00:50:32,177 --> 00:50:35,397
Yeah I guess you could be right. I guess, I mean

1041
00:50:36,847 --> 00:50:38,127
That's kind of funny

1042
00:50:41,837 --> 00:50:43,457
What is it, Voldemort?

1043
00:50:43,457 --> 00:50:45,457
Oh it's just that I never

1044
00:50:45,457 --> 00:50:47,457
I never ever really ever

1045
00:50:47,457 --> 00:50:49,457
ever really ever ever really

1046
00:50:49,457 --> 00:50:53,477
considered another reason for me being so evil, you know?

1047
00:50:53,477 --> 00:50:55,477
'Cause normally I just, uh

1048
00:50:55,967 --> 00:50:59,277
I just kill people that try to get me to open up, you know?

1049
00:51:01,677 --> 00:51:02,747
Oops...

1050
00:51:04,747 --> 00:51:07,607
But uh, it's- it's kind of nice to just, um

1051
00:51:07,837 --> 00:51:09,607
Kind of nice to just talk

1052
00:51:11,297 --> 00:51:12,697
You know, I have to admit

1053
00:51:12,897 --> 00:51:16,557
I was kind of nervous when you first demanded that you attached yourself to my soul

1054
00:51:17,027 --> 00:51:18,717
Yeah I could, I could sense that

1055
00:51:19,887 --> 00:51:21,957
But like, now I think it's

1056
00:51:22,297 --> 00:51:26,297
It's kind of cool, it's like having a really close roommate or

1057
00:51:26,297 --> 00:51:26,897
or even...

1058
00:51:26,897 --> 00:51:28,387
Yeah like a slave

1059
00:51:30,057 --> 00:51:31,587
Like a, like a Death Eater

1060
00:51:33,487 --> 00:51:34,567
No man

1061
00:51:34,567 --> 00:51:36,877
It's like... having a friend

1062
00:51:46,547 --> 00:51:48,317
I've never had a friend before

1063
00:51:49,857 --> 00:51:51,647
It looks like we've got one now

1064
00:51:59,237 --> 00:52:01,857
Who would've thought that at the beginning of this year

1065
00:52:02,127 --> 00:52:04,287
we'd feel like that for each other?

1066
00:52:05,797 --> 00:52:08,717
I guess everything is different between us now, huh?

1067
00:52:10,847 --> 00:52:13,407
I guess it's plain to see

1068
00:52:13,837 --> 00:52:18,187
When you look at you and me

1069
00:52:18,607 --> 00:52:20,787
We're... different

1070
00:52:21,507 --> 00:52:22,547
Different

1071
00:52:22,547 --> 00:52:24,637
As can be

1072
00:52:27,687 --> 00:52:33,447
We simply guarantee, when you look at you and me

1073
00:52:33,447 --> 00:52:36,257
We're different, different

1074
00:52:36,257 --> 00:52:39,587
As can be

1075
00:52:40,607 --> 00:52:43,037
It's a comedy of sorts

1076
00:52:43,037 --> 00:52:47,297
When you're bound to Voldemort

1077
00:52:48,317 --> 00:52:51,177
And I'm happy as a squirrel

1078
00:52:52,177 --> 00:52:57,487
Long as I'm with Mister Quirrell

1079
00:52:58,577 --> 00:53:02,177
We'll lead them to the slaughter and we'll murder Harry Potter

1080
00:53:02,177 --> 00:53:05,207
We're different

1081
00:53:05,207 --> 00:53:08,057
Different

1082
00:53:08,057 --> 00:53:11,397
Different, different as can be

1083
00:53:20,528 --> 00:53:24,368
The Hogwarts champions shall now enter the champion's tent

1084
00:53:24,368 --> 00:53:27,368
in preparation for the first task

1085
00:53:30,928 --> 00:53:34,238
Oh man, I can't believe I have to skip lunch period for this stupid task

1086
00:53:34,408 --> 00:53:36,388
Okay Harry, today's the day

1087
00:53:36,728 --> 00:53:39,988
The day you fight the dragon. Now, did you read those notes I wrote for you on dragons?

1088
00:53:40,178 --> 00:53:40,948
No

1089
00:53:41,628 --> 00:53:42,658
What? Why not?

1090
00:53:42,658 --> 00:53:44,188
You kidding me? They were so boring

1091
00:53:45,558 --> 00:53:48,898
So y-you didn't read them. You didn't prepare at all? You're not prepared at all?

1092
00:53:49,088 --> 00:53:50,908
Well no, at least I have my wand

1093
00:53:51,458 --> 00:53:52,588
Um...

1094
00:53:53,778 --> 00:53:54,358
Brought my-

1095
00:53:54,468 --> 00:53:55,638
Harry

1096
00:53:58,878 --> 00:53:59,938
You're the best

1097
00:54:01,088 --> 00:54:03,778
Harry just, please don't die today

1098
00:54:03,778 --> 00:54:06,468
I don't want to see my best friend getting eaten by a dragon

1099
00:54:06,468 --> 00:54:07,958
Relax okay?

1100
00:54:07,958 --> 00:54:09,978
Save the tears for my funeral

1101
00:54:11,538 --> 00:54:16,458
So tell me more about this Pigfarts. I find it to be very interesting

1102
00:54:17,168 --> 00:54:17,868
Well

1103
00:54:17,868 --> 00:54:20,698
While you're there you have to wear your spacesuit at all times

1104
00:54:20,698 --> 00:54:22,408
because there's no atmosphere on Mars

1105
00:54:22,408 --> 00:54:25,928
So if a single docking bay door opens you'll probably die

1106
00:54:26,588 --> 00:54:27,718
My, how dreadful

1107
00:54:27,968 --> 00:54:29,658
Well, but the good news is

1108
00:54:29,658 --> 00:54:33,938
If you're a good enough student, Rumbleroar lets you ride around on his back

1109
00:54:35,408 --> 00:54:37,538
And he's the headmaster lion?

1110
00:54:37,668 --> 00:54:39,058
Who can talk

1111
00:54:39,058 --> 00:54:40,188
Cool...

1112
00:54:40,738 --> 00:54:42,868
Well hello Harry. How are you feeling today?

1113
00:54:42,868 --> 00:54:44,338
Hey Cedric. Trying to-

1114
00:54:44,658 --> 00:54:46,068
Stay positive

1115
00:54:46,558 --> 00:54:47,308
Cedric: Well good

1116
00:54:47,308 --> 00:54:49,608
I'm having a fine time at the championships

1117
00:54:50,198 --> 00:54:51,188
Miss Granger?

1118
00:54:51,188 --> 00:54:52,268
Hello

1119
00:54:52,268 --> 00:54:53,568
Cho: Sugar pie!

1120
00:54:53,568 --> 00:54:55,568
My darling!

1121
00:54:57,128 --> 00:54:58,478
Was that a kiss for good luck?

1122
00:54:58,478 --> 00:55:01,308
No, that was for being so cotton-picking cute!

1123
00:55:01,308 --> 00:55:02,628
This one's for good luck

1124
00:55:04,078 --> 00:55:05,318
Harry: I hate that guy

1125
00:55:05,698 --> 00:55:07,598
Hermione: It's okay Harry, you're going to be great today

1126
00:55:07,598 --> 00:55:08,658
Dumbledore: Oh God!

1127
00:55:08,658 --> 00:55:11,578
Granger, I thought you were a boggart. I'm terrified of them

1128
00:55:13,328 --> 00:55:16,018
And what the hell are you doing in the champions' tent?

1129
00:55:16,018 --> 00:55:18,528
Get out of here. Ten more points

1130
00:55:18,528 --> 00:55:19,598
Thanks Hermione

1131
00:55:19,998 --> 00:55:25,028
Are you kids ready to fight a dragon?

1132
00:55:25,028 --> 00:55:27,378
Of course you are, you're just children. What the hell am I thinking?

1133
00:55:28,848 --> 00:55:32,198
Now outside of this tent are thousands upon thousands of screaming fans

1134
00:55:32,198 --> 00:55:34,388
They're either going to be cheering for you, or the dragon

1135
00:55:34,388 --> 00:55:36,568
but either way they're going to be making some kind of noise. So-

1136
00:55:36,818 --> 00:55:39,848
in order for this election process to be fair

1137
00:55:39,848 --> 00:55:43,858
I am going to randomly select a cardboard cutout size version

1138
00:55:43,858 --> 00:55:45,748
of the dragon you will be defeating

1139
00:55:47,138 --> 00:55:48,328
For you Cedric...

1140
00:55:48,688 --> 00:55:50,438
Puff the Magic Dragon

1141
00:55:52,978 --> 00:55:55,338
Figment the Imaginary Dragon

1142
00:55:57,028 --> 00:55:59,368
The Reluctant Dragon

1143
00:56:01,158 --> 00:56:02,718
And for you Potter...

1144
00:56:03,168 --> 00:56:04,358
The Hungarian Horntail

1145
00:56:04,358 --> 00:56:06,278
the most terrifying thing you'll ever see in your whole life!

1146
00:56:07,748 --> 00:56:09,708
Dumbledore: You've gotten all complete

1147
00:56:09,708 --> 00:56:10,288
Harry: W-wait hold on a second. Dumbledore, wait a second
Dumbledore: You've gotten all complete

1148
00:56:10,288 --> 00:56:12,198
I think I will-
Harry: W-wait hold on a second. Dumbledore, wait a second

1149
00:56:12,198 --> 00:56:13,438
T-this is terrifying

1150
00:56:13,438 --> 00:56:15,508
Those are the cutest things I've ever seen

1151
00:56:16,528 --> 00:56:18,578
This thing is horrifying

1152
00:56:18,748 --> 00:56:20,328
Just use your imagination

1153
00:56:20,838 --> 00:56:21,968
Disembrace

1154
00:56:24,458 --> 00:56:26,738
Oh my God this competition's gonna suck

1155
00:56:26,738 --> 00:56:27,828
all these dragon's are wimps

1156
00:56:27,828 --> 00:56:29,058
Accio doublestuff

1157
00:56:31,728 --> 00:56:32,838
Wow, look at that one

1158
00:56:32,838 --> 00:56:34,668
Oh my God monster!

1159
00:56:35,418 --> 00:56:36,208
Is that yours?

1160
00:56:36,208 --> 00:56:36,648
Yeah!

1161
00:56:36,648 --> 00:56:37,628
Oh my God it's awesome

1162
00:56:37,628 --> 00:56:38,758
Let me hold it

1163
00:56:39,978 --> 00:56:41,698
Oh my God this thing is terrifying

1164
00:56:41,698 --> 00:56:43,238
I hope the real thing is smaller

1165
00:56:45,428 --> 00:56:46,798
Ferocious. What're you gonna do?

1166
00:56:46,798 --> 00:56:49,098
I don't know, I'm not cut out for this kind of thing. It's gonna kill me

1167
00:56:49,118 --> 00:56:51,468
Hermione: Ron- Ron! You can't be in here this is the champions' tent!

1168
00:56:51,468 --> 00:56:52,618
Snape: Miss Granger

1169
00:56:52,828 --> 00:56:55,198
What the devil are you doing in the champions' tent?

1170
00:56:55,198 --> 00:56:56,838
Ten points from Gryffindor

1171
00:56:57,158 --> 00:56:57,708
Harry: Thanks Hermione

1172
00:56:57,708 --> 00:56:58,478
Thanks Hermione

1173
00:56:58,478 --> 00:56:59,888
Hey! Good luck buddy

1174
00:56:59,888 --> 00:57:00,398
Bye Snape!

1175
00:57:00,398 --> 00:57:01,188
Snape: Bye

1176
00:57:05,878 --> 00:57:07,278
Cedric Diggory

1177
00:57:07,518 --> 00:57:10,758
Now is your chance to face your dragon

1178
00:57:11,008 --> 00:57:12,758
Alright fellas wish me luck

1179
00:57:12,758 --> 00:57:14,358
I believe in you

1180
00:57:14,758 --> 00:57:17,168
That's all I needed to hear

1181
00:57:20,198 --> 00:57:21,608
Hey Malfoy, tell you what

1182
00:57:21,608 --> 00:57:23,028
I'll let you switch dragons with me

1183
00:57:23,028 --> 00:57:26,418
I'll give you the chance to switch dragons with me. I'll give you that opportunity

1184
00:57:26,418 --> 00:57:27,718
Tell you what, don't worry about it

1185
00:57:27,808 --> 00:57:28,638
Let me think abou-

1186
00:57:28,638 --> 00:57:29,198
No

1187
00:57:30,598 --> 00:57:32,458
I'll, uh, I'll give you my Gushers

1188
00:57:33,458 --> 00:57:35,138
Oh, no, no

1189
00:57:35,138 --> 00:57:36,358
I have a Fruit by the Foot

1190
00:57:36,358 --> 00:57:37,358
I don't want to

1191
00:57:39,428 --> 00:57:41,728
A Cho Chang?

1192
00:57:41,898 --> 00:57:44,008
Your dragon awaits

1193
00:57:44,008 --> 00:57:47,628
Well... I can't imagine this would be very hard

1194
00:57:47,628 --> 00:57:50,418
Then I... imagine it won't be

1195
00:57:56,068 --> 00:57:58,058
Malfoy, come on! Uh, tell you what

1196
00:57:58,058 --> 00:57:59,908
I'll throw in my Teddy Grahams, with the Gushers

1197
00:57:59,908 --> 00:58:02,128
You can make little Gusher Teddy Graham sandwiches

1198
00:58:02,888 --> 00:58:03,938
Alright

1199
00:58:04,488 --> 00:58:07,368
You throw in that pack of Bugles and you've got yourself a deal

1200
00:58:10,158 --> 00:58:11,098
Absolutely not

1201
00:58:13,148 --> 00:58:15,618
Draco Malfoy, your turn

1202
00:58:18,408 --> 00:58:21,548
Professor Snape is there any way that I could, I dunno, forfeit or switch dragons

1203
00:58:21,548 --> 00:58:22,888
Or maybe just take a day off

1204
00:58:22,888 --> 00:58:24,888
What- what're you, what're you. What're you doing? What is that?

1205
00:58:24,888 --> 00:58:26,528
I'm protecting you Potter

1206
00:58:26,528 --> 00:58:28,768
Welsh Greenbacks can't stand the taste of

1207
00:58:28,768 --> 00:58:30,048
Hunt's tomato ketchup

1208
00:58:32,198 --> 00:58:35,248
But I'm not fighting a Welsh Greenback, I'm fighting a Hungarian Horntail

1209
00:58:35,828 --> 00:58:37,738
Oho, well silly me

1210
00:58:37,978 --> 00:58:41,498
Hunt's tomato ketchup is what Hungarian Horntails love best of all

1211
00:58:42,518 --> 00:58:43,478
Good luck Potter

1212
00:58:43,478 --> 00:58:44,478
What? No!

1213
00:58:45,798 --> 00:58:49,528
Dumbledore: And now Harry Potter will battle the terrifying Hungarian Horntail

1214
00:58:49,528 --> 00:58:51,528
the most terrifying thing you'll ever see in your whole life

1215
00:58:51,538 --> 00:58:55,588
It should be noted that this particular dragon has not been fed

1216
00:58:55,588 --> 00:58:57,158
in two weeks

1217
00:58:57,158 --> 00:58:57,838
Hermione: Come on Harry

1218
00:58:57,838 --> 00:58:58,418
Go Harry!

1219
00:58:58,418 --> 00:58:59,078
You can do it Harry

1220
00:58:59,488 --> 00:59:00,038
Ron: You got it, yeah! You got this

1221
00:59:00,038 --> 00:59:01,078
Hermione: Just think positive. You can do it!
Ron: You got it, yeah! You got this

1222
00:59:01,078 --> 00:59:01,918
Hermione: Just think positive. You can do it!

1223
00:59:08,858 --> 00:59:09,888
Oh my God!

1224
00:59:11,168 --> 00:59:12,528
Accio guitar!

1225
00:59:21,078 --> 00:59:22,778
Hey dragon

1226
00:59:24,468 --> 00:59:26,638
You don't gotta do this

1227
00:59:28,538 --> 00:59:30,818
Let's reevaluate our options

1228
00:59:30,818 --> 00:59:32,818
Throw away our old assumptions

1229
00:59:32,818 --> 00:59:36,078
'Cause really, you don't gotta go through this

1230
00:59:36,808 --> 00:59:38,858
I'm really not that special

1231
00:59:38,858 --> 00:59:41,598
The Boy Who Lived is only flesh and bone

1232
00:59:44,398 --> 00:59:46,168
The truth is in the end

1233
00:59:46,168 --> 00:59:48,598
I'm pretty useless without friends

1234
00:59:49,408 --> 00:59:51,688
In fact I'm alone

1235
00:59:54,908 --> 00:59:56,718
I spend my time at school

1236
00:59:56,888 --> 00:59:59,618
Trying to be this cool guy

1237
01:00:00,718 --> 01:00:02,468
I never even asked for

1238
01:00:02,468 --> 01:00:04,368
I don't know any spells

1239
01:00:04,368 --> 01:00:06,288
Still manage to do well

1240
01:00:06,288 --> 01:00:09,928
But there's only so long that can last for

1241
01:00:10,468 --> 01:00:12,358
I'm living off the glory

1242
01:00:12,358 --> 01:00:15,108
Of a stupid children's story that I

1243
01:00:15,108 --> 01:00:17,538
have nothing to do with

1244
01:00:18,098 --> 01:00:19,758
I just sat there and got lucky

1245
01:00:19,908 --> 01:00:21,868
So level with me buddy

1246
01:00:22,788 --> 01:00:25,678
I can't defeat thee

1247
01:00:27,198 --> 01:00:29,308
So please don't eat me

1248
01:00:30,248 --> 01:00:32,738
And all I can do

1249
01:00:33,698 --> 01:00:36,108
is sing a song for you

1250
01:00:52,878 --> 01:00:54,798
You never asked to be a dragon!

1251
01:00:54,798 --> 01:00:56,698
I never asked to be a champion!

1252
01:00:56,698 --> 01:00:58,568
We both just jumped on this bandwagon

1253
01:00:58,568 --> 01:01:01,108
but all we need is guitar jammin'

1254
01:01:12,368 --> 01:01:13,958
Goodnight dragon

1255
01:01:25,148 --> 01:01:26,258
One, two, three!

1256
01:01:26,258 --> 01:01:27,368
I beat the dragon!

1257
01:01:41,019 --> 01:01:43,469
Attention all Hogwarts students

1258
01:01:43,789 --> 01:01:45,789
Tonight is our annual Yule Ball

1259
01:01:46,109 --> 01:01:48,919
So please remember to pick up your Yule Ball wreath

1260
01:01:49,069 --> 01:01:52,399
and give it to that special someone

1261
01:01:56,409 --> 01:01:57,579
Ah! Ginger!

1262
01:02:09,639 --> 01:02:11,989
Oh, hey. Harry Potter?

1263
01:02:11,989 --> 01:02:12,839
Oh hi Ginny

1264
01:02:12,839 --> 01:02:14,349
Fancy seeing you here huh?

1265
01:02:14,499 --> 01:02:16,849
Well it's the cafeteria so yeah

1266
01:02:18,719 --> 01:02:20,639
Um, so... um

1267
01:02:20,639 --> 01:02:22,219
The Yule Ball's coming up, huh?

1268
01:02:22,219 --> 01:02:24,219
Yeah I know it is. Very, very soon, yeah

1269
01:02:24,219 --> 01:02:26,799
Um, well were you thinking of going with anybody?

1270
01:02:26,969 --> 01:02:30,359
I was. I was actually just waiting for the right time to ask somebody and I think

1271
01:02:30,639 --> 01:02:32,619
I think that time's about now so if-

1272
01:02:33,199 --> 01:02:36,139
If you've got something to say just... get it out

1273
01:02:41,299 --> 01:02:42,469
Oh is this for me?

1274
01:02:43,209 --> 01:02:46,109
Ah Ginny how did you know I needed a wreath so I could ask Cho Chang?

1275
01:02:46,109 --> 01:02:47,439
You're the best!

1276
01:02:50,329 --> 01:02:52,679
Harry Potter... just- you

1277
01:02:52,929 --> 01:02:54,209
Forget it!

1278
01:02:55,679 --> 01:02:57,089
Alright I will!

1279
01:02:59,899 --> 01:03:00,989
Cool

1280
01:03:02,209 --> 01:03:02,779
Hey

1281
01:03:03,309 --> 01:03:04,739
Hey Cho Chang listen, um

1282
01:03:04,979 --> 01:03:07,749
I know the Yule Ball's coming up and I was wondering if

1283
01:03:08,049 --> 01:03:09,179
Maybe you wanted to go with me

1284
01:03:09,199 --> 01:03:12,219
But just in case you're kind of on the fence about it

1285
01:03:12,219 --> 01:03:13,759
You should know that I play guitar

1286
01:03:13,839 --> 01:03:16,379
and that I conquered that dragon's heart with it

1287
01:03:16,379 --> 01:03:18,379
So I think I could conquer yours

1288
01:03:18,509 --> 01:03:21,649
You're tall and fun and pretty, you're really, really skinny

1289
01:03:22,289 --> 01:03:23,929
Cho Chang

1290
01:03:24,589 --> 01:03:27,679
You're the Mickey to my Minnie, I'm the Tigger to your Winnie

1291
01:03:28,419 --> 01:03:30,129
Cho Chang

1292
01:03:30,729 --> 01:03:33,259
You're cuter than a guinea pig

1293
01:03:33,919 --> 01:03:35,439
I'll take you up to Winnipeg

1294
01:03:35,439 --> 01:03:37,439
That's in Canada!

1295
01:03:38,169 --> 01:03:41,809
Ooh Cho Chang. Ch-ch-ch-ch cha chadda chadda

1296
01:03:41,809 --> 01:03:43,069
Cho Chang

1297
01:03:43,069 --> 01:03:43,919
Whatever

1298
01:03:45,949 --> 01:03:47,949
Well Harry Potter

1299
01:03:48,399 --> 01:03:50,139
Bless your heart

1300
01:03:50,549 --> 01:03:51,419
Um, but

1301
01:03:51,419 --> 01:03:52,809
I'm gonna have to say no?

1302
01:03:53,359 --> 01:03:56,449
That young strapping boy Cedric Diggory

1303
01:03:56,449 --> 01:03:59,139
already asked me and I'm gonna go with him

1304
01:03:59,909 --> 01:04:00,839
Sorry

1305
01:04:01,609 --> 01:04:04,619
Come on girls, let's go show Moaning Myrtle our ball gowns

1306
01:04:04,619 --> 01:04:06,489
and make fun of her because she can't go

1307
01:04:06,489 --> 01:04:08,049
Yeah!

1308
01:04:16,359 --> 01:04:17,809
Hey there good buddy, how are you doing?

1309
01:04:18,409 --> 01:04:19,279
Okay

1310
01:04:19,279 --> 01:04:20,579
Is that a Yule Ball wreath?

1311
01:04:20,769 --> 01:04:21,499
Yeah

1312
01:04:21,499 --> 01:04:22,989
Who you gonna ask?

1313
01:04:24,969 --> 01:04:27,019
Well I asked Cho Chang but she turned me down

1314
01:04:27,019 --> 01:04:28,789
Cedric... Stuppery

1315
01:04:28,789 --> 01:04:30,709
Oh my God they're going together? That's so great

1316
01:04:30,709 --> 01:04:32,539
I love him so- they're so, cute

1317
01:04:32,539 --> 01:04:33,179
Harry: No, no
I love him so- they're so, cute

1318
01:04:33,179 --> 01:04:33,349
Harry: No, no

1319
01:04:33,349 --> 01:04:33,839
I hate him. I hate him so much
Harry: No, no

1320
01:04:33,839 --> 01:04:34,099
I hate him. I hate him so much

1321
01:04:34,099 --> 01:04:34,609
Harry: Yeah
I hate him. I hate him so much

1322
01:04:34,609 --> 01:04:35,419
I hate him. I hate him so much

1323
01:04:35,549 --> 01:04:37,379
Oh my God he pisses me off, wow

1324
01:04:38,419 --> 01:04:40,939
Aw man that sucks dude. I don't know why she'd turn you down

1325
01:04:40,939 --> 01:04:42,199
You're like the coolest guy in school

1326
01:04:42,199 --> 01:04:44,479
I don't know, I get it. I play guitar, I'm Harry Potter

1327
01:04:44,479 --> 01:04:45,179
I'm awesome

1328
01:04:45,439 --> 01:04:46,289
Reese's Pieces?

1329
01:04:46,289 --> 01:04:46,839
Yeah...

1330
01:04:47,969 --> 01:04:50,299
I don't get it man I mean I guess I'll just go stag, huh?

1331
01:04:50,469 --> 01:04:51,699
Yeah I'll probably go stag too

1332
01:04:51,789 --> 01:04:54,669
And the only two girls that I know that don't have dates already are Ginny

1333
01:04:55,619 --> 01:04:56,329
and Hermione

1334
01:04:56,329 --> 01:04:56,729
Oh my God

1335
01:04:58,669 --> 01:05:00,209
And I'm not going with my stupid sister

1336
01:05:00,339 --> 01:05:02,619
And I think of Hermione as a sister so that's out

1337
01:05:02,619 --> 01:05:04,339
We are in such a puzzle

1338
01:05:04,339 --> 01:05:05,539
Harry: What a conundrum

1339
01:05:06,429 --> 01:05:08,219
Neville: Hi, look at these strapping young men

1340
01:05:08,609 --> 01:05:09,289
Hey Neville

1341
01:05:10,519 --> 01:05:12,549
Hey Neville, you want this Yule Ball wreath?

1342
01:05:12,999 --> 01:05:15,229
Uh yeah, if you're willing to part with it then I will take this wreath

1343
01:05:15,679 --> 01:05:16,899
Hey Ron, let's go hang out with Hagrid

1344
01:05:16,899 --> 01:05:18,649
He can teach us how to dance so we could get in our dress robes

1345
01:05:19,309 --> 01:05:21,499
That can only lead to disaster and hilaree

1346
01:05:21,499 --> 01:05:22,159
Well let's go

1347
01:05:23,529 --> 01:05:26,019
I mean I just don't know about Hermione. I don't think anyone's asked her yet, you know

1348
01:05:26,019 --> 01:05:26,659
'cause she's just-

1349
01:05:26,659 --> 01:05:27,849
she's just so butt ugly

1350
01:05:27,849 --> 01:05:28,509
Harry: Hideous

1351
01:05:34,099 --> 01:05:35,419
Give that plant nerd!

1352
01:05:37,659 --> 01:05:39,619
Oh, Goyle rules!

1353
01:05:45,179 --> 01:05:46,329
Draco: Yeah so anyway

1354
01:05:46,399 --> 01:05:48,609
He was reluctant enough at first

1355
01:05:49,039 --> 01:05:52,899
but I lured it out of its cage with an upside down pig

1356
01:05:53,009 --> 01:05:54,919
and I sewed it with my Fruit by the Foot

1357
01:05:54,919 --> 01:05:57,869
and beheaded it with a quick slicing charm. Bloody fool...

1358
01:05:58,479 --> 01:05:59,869
Wh- Goyle?

1359
01:06:00,269 --> 01:06:01,419
What are you doing with that wreath?

1360
01:06:01,419 --> 01:06:03,279
What are you, going to ask someone to the Yule Ball?

1361
01:06:04,129 --> 01:06:04,839
...No

1362
01:06:05,149 --> 01:06:06,459
Dancing is for nerds

1363
01:06:06,459 --> 01:06:07,689
Crabbe: And pretty girls

1364
01:06:07,689 --> 01:06:08,819
That's right

1365
01:06:09,869 --> 01:06:13,169
You know who the last girl I'd have asked to the Yule Ball would be?

1366
01:06:14,169 --> 01:06:15,939
That Hermione Granger

1367
01:06:18,329 --> 01:06:21,229
Not even if we were the last two people on earth

1368
01:06:21,229 --> 01:06:23,869
and she looked absolutely stunning in her ball gown

1369
01:06:23,869 --> 01:06:26,529
so every time I'd looked at her I'd got butterflies in my tummy

1370
01:06:29,429 --> 01:06:30,519
Not even then

1371
01:06:32,479 --> 01:06:33,289
You know

1372
01:06:33,589 --> 01:06:35,489
They don't even have dances at Pigfarts

1373
01:06:36,319 --> 01:06:38,699
All of the noise would disturb Rumbleroar's slumbering cub

1374
01:06:42,629 --> 01:06:44,649
Dancing is for pansies

1375
01:06:44,649 --> 01:06:45,269
Right

1376
01:06:46,419 --> 01:06:47,829
Draco: Hey you there what's your name?

1377
01:06:48,039 --> 01:06:48,659
Pansy

1378
01:06:48,659 --> 01:06:49,359
Perfect!

1379
01:06:50,879 --> 01:06:52,499
You're going to the Yule Ball with me

1380
01:06:52,919 --> 01:06:53,949
Do you see that dragon?

1381
01:06:54,369 --> 01:06:55,969
Well it was reluctant enough at first

1382
01:06:55,969 --> 01:06:58,269
but I lured it out of its cage with an upside down...

1383
01:06:58,269 --> 01:06:58,909
Quirrell: Yule Ball decorating crew
but I lured it out of its cage with an upside down...

1384
01:06:58,909 --> 01:07:00,209
Quirrell: Yule Ball decorating crew

1385
01:07:00,299 --> 01:07:03,839
Just the Yule Ball decorating crew coming through

1386
01:07:03,979 --> 01:07:06,009
Last minute decorations

1387
01:07:12,979 --> 01:07:16,329
My Lord, the Yule Ball has finally arrived and I've brought the key!

1388
01:07:16,539 --> 01:07:17,799
Yes I know Quirrell

1389
01:07:17,799 --> 01:07:21,189
I hear everything you hear!

1390
01:07:22,289 --> 01:07:23,829
I'm sorry

1391
01:07:24,679 --> 01:07:27,769
No I'm sorry, I shouldn't have snapped

1392
01:07:29,309 --> 01:07:31,099
I'm just nervous that's all

1393
01:07:31,099 --> 01:07:31,869
Nervous?

1394
01:07:31,869 --> 01:07:32,419
No

1395
01:07:32,419 --> 01:07:32,949
Why?

1396
01:07:32,949 --> 01:07:34,059
I don't want to talk about it

1397
01:07:35,679 --> 01:07:37,319
Hey, it's just me

1398
01:07:37,709 --> 01:07:40,259
You can tell me anything, you know that

1399
01:07:41,709 --> 01:07:43,379
Yeah, yeah, you're right, you're right

1400
01:07:45,119 --> 01:07:48,129
I'm just nervous because we've been planning this night for so long

1401
01:07:48,129 --> 01:07:50,859
and I want everything to go perfectly, you know?

1402
01:07:50,899 --> 01:07:53,669
Don't worry. We've mapped out everything

1403
01:07:53,669 --> 01:07:56,849
We've anticipated every little problem and compensated for it

1404
01:07:57,249 --> 01:08:00,209
We've even prepared what you're going to say to Potter when you see him

1405
01:08:00,559 --> 01:08:01,749
So just cool down

1406
01:08:02,129 --> 01:08:03,069
Relax

1407
01:08:03,389 --> 01:08:06,519
By the end of the night you'll have your revenge and your body back

1408
01:08:06,739 --> 01:08:09,079
You're right, you're right I'm being... silly

1409
01:08:12,389 --> 01:08:13,509
And you know I-

1410
01:08:15,219 --> 01:08:16,949
Quirrell over the last year I've-

1411
01:08:17,179 --> 01:08:18,779
I've really grown attached to you

1412
01:08:20,439 --> 01:08:21,399
No pun intended

1413
01:08:22,379 --> 01:08:23,899
Yeah I know what you mean

1414
01:08:24,489 --> 01:08:26,179
But, hey, we'll still hang out

1415
01:08:26,429 --> 01:08:29,909
Just because we won't be attached doesn't mean we'll be two completely different people

1416
01:08:29,909 --> 01:08:30,779
No pun intended

1417
01:08:30,909 --> 01:08:33,249
No, no of course not, of course not

1418
01:08:35,279 --> 01:08:36,169
Hey Quirrell

1419
01:08:36,959 --> 01:08:38,109
We should make plans

1420
01:08:38,109 --> 01:08:39,009
Evil plans?

1421
01:08:39,009 --> 01:08:40,439
Oh uh...

1422
01:08:41,009 --> 01:08:41,689
No

1423
01:08:42,029 --> 01:08:43,379
Casual plans

1424
01:08:43,629 --> 01:08:44,909
Like um

1425
01:08:45,129 --> 01:08:48,019
We could go rollerblading on a Saturday and then uh

1426
01:08:48,019 --> 01:08:49,619
see a movie at night, huh?

1427
01:08:49,769 --> 01:08:50,369
Yeah

1428
01:08:50,689 --> 01:08:53,589
It'll be great because we'd both be able to watch it for a change

1429
01:08:53,589 --> 01:08:54,849
Yeah yeah...

1430
01:08:55,479 --> 01:08:58,149
I bet it'll be nice to sleep in our own beds

1431
01:08:58,639 --> 01:09:00,809
Not have someone behind you all the time

1432
01:09:02,539 --> 01:09:05,609
And have the privacy of my old life back again

1433
01:09:06,649 --> 01:09:07,589
The solitude

1434
01:09:13,389 --> 01:09:13,899
No

1435
01:09:15,859 --> 01:09:17,609
Whatever happens tonight man

1436
01:09:17,609 --> 01:09:18,189
It's-

1437
01:09:18,529 --> 01:09:20,189
It's been a blast

1438
01:09:20,679 --> 01:09:21,489
Yeah

1439
01:09:21,769 --> 01:09:22,999
One crazy year

1440
01:09:25,859 --> 01:09:26,499
Hey

1441
01:09:26,919 --> 01:09:29,179
Promise we'll go rollerblading and see that movie

1442
01:09:29,179 --> 01:09:30,119
Oh, man

1443
01:09:30,569 --> 01:09:31,779
I promise

1444
01:09:38,819 --> 01:09:39,609
Okay

1445
01:09:40,139 --> 01:09:40,909
Quirrell

1446
01:09:41,009 --> 01:09:43,469
Let's go plant that key and split

1447
01:09:43,699 --> 01:09:45,109
Pun intended!

1448
01:09:49,219 --> 01:09:50,579
Snape: Why Professor Quirrell

1449
01:09:52,399 --> 01:09:54,869
What on earth are you doing in the Great Dance Hall?

1450
01:09:54,869 --> 01:09:56,599
Just moments before the dance?

1451
01:09:58,829 --> 01:10:02,439
Just decorating for the Yule Ball. Last minute decorations

1452
01:10:02,439 --> 01:10:03,909
Just one final touch

1453
01:10:03,909 --> 01:10:05,009
A ladle?

1454
01:10:05,779 --> 01:10:08,399
A very special ladle for a very special night

1455
01:10:08,399 --> 01:10:10,129
For a very special punch

1456
01:10:10,339 --> 01:10:12,729
And what's so special about it?

1457
01:10:13,349 --> 01:10:15,859
Let's just say there's Squirt in it

1458
01:10:15,859 --> 01:10:16,589
Squirt?

1459
01:10:17,779 --> 01:10:20,399
Is that not the favorite drink of one Harry Potter?

1460
01:10:22,979 --> 01:10:25,649
Is it? I had no idea

1461
01:10:25,989 --> 01:10:27,609
Well, we better be going

1462
01:10:27,609 --> 01:10:28,119
We?

1463
01:10:28,669 --> 01:10:30,979
I... I better be going

1464
01:10:30,979 --> 01:10:32,979
Loud music hurts my ears

1465
01:10:33,109 --> 01:10:34,959
Okay well I'll see you later then

1466
01:10:35,319 --> 01:10:36,349
Or maybe you won't

1467
01:10:36,349 --> 01:10:37,709
Or maybe I will

1468
01:10:41,359 --> 01:10:43,489
Dumbledore: Excuse me, it was my fault

1469
01:10:43,599 --> 01:10:44,899
Hey Severus!

1470
01:10:44,899 --> 01:10:46,519
Oh, uh Headmaster

1471
01:10:46,519 --> 01:10:47,989
Dumbledore: What are you doing here? Getting some punch are you?

1472
01:10:47,989 --> 01:10:49,859
Oh no no there's Squirt in that

1473
01:10:49,859 --> 01:10:51,889
Oh only Harry Potter likes that hog's shit

1474
01:10:51,889 --> 01:10:54,059
I'll stick to my Red Bull thank you very much

1475
01:10:55,429 --> 01:10:57,149
Oh well goodnight Headmaster

1476
01:10:57,149 --> 01:10:57,979
Severus I-

1477
01:10:58,109 --> 01:11:00,009
I saved this last dance for you

1478
01:11:01,069 --> 01:11:02,779
Well I would Headmaster, but you see

1479
01:11:03,369 --> 01:11:06,039
Well an old friend is coming back into town tonight

1480
01:11:06,039 --> 01:11:06,679
Dumbledore: Oh

1481
01:11:28,830 --> 01:11:29,300
Hey Ron

1482
01:11:29,300 --> 01:11:30,280
Ron: Hey what's up dude how's it going?

1483
01:11:30,280 --> 01:11:31,310
Have you seen Hermione anywhere?

1484
01:11:31,310 --> 01:11:32,090
Harry: No I haven't

1485
01:11:32,860 --> 01:11:33,350
Harry: Why?

1486
01:11:34,270 --> 01:11:36,290
Nothing, nothing. It's just, you know I-

1487
01:11:37,300 --> 01:11:39,680
I heard Parvati Patil telling Padma Patil that

1488
01:11:39,680 --> 01:11:42,410
she had seen Hermione in the girl's locker room before just

1489
01:11:42,410 --> 01:11:44,390
crying her eyes out in the bathroom stall

1490
01:11:44,390 --> 01:11:45,230
Harry: Why? What happened?

1491
01:11:45,230 --> 01:11:47,230
I don't know isn't that like the saddest thing you've ever heard?

1492
01:11:47,230 --> 01:11:47,570
Harry: Yeah

1493
01:11:47,570 --> 01:11:48,780
I mean I don't know it's just

1494
01:11:48,980 --> 01:11:51,470
It was inevitable that one day Hermione would realize

1495
01:11:51,470 --> 01:11:53,690
that nobody would ever like her, you know?

1496
01:11:53,690 --> 01:11:56,460
Because of her obnoxious personality

1497
01:11:56,460 --> 01:11:57,910
and her ugly face

1498
01:11:57,910 --> 01:12:00,700
and misshapen body, but you know it's just

1499
01:12:00,700 --> 01:12:04,150
I don't know, I figured she'd get into at least one night of happiness

1500
01:12:04,150 --> 01:12:06,520
before she realize she was gonna be growing old alone, you know?

1501
01:12:06,520 --> 01:12:08,570
Draco: Hey you two over here talking about Granger?

1502
01:12:08,570 --> 01:12:09,930
Malfoy get out of here it's none of your business

1503
01:12:09,930 --> 01:12:11,680
Why don't you go dance with Pansy over there?

1504
01:12:12,680 --> 01:12:14,700
Hey, go get me some punch

1505
01:12:14,700 --> 01:12:15,580
Pansy: Okay

1506
01:12:16,170 --> 01:12:19,440
Wait, um, I should tell you there's Squirt in it

1507
01:12:19,440 --> 01:12:19,990
Harry: Oh nice

1508
01:12:19,990 --> 01:12:21,670
Squirt? Ugh
Harry: Oh nice

1509
01:12:21,670 --> 01:12:23,740
Never mind I'll stay dehydrated

1510
01:12:25,570 --> 01:12:27,860
Go, go powder your nose or something

1511
01:12:27,860 --> 01:12:30,860
But I just fixed my make up a little while ago

1512
01:12:31,160 --> 01:12:32,610
Ugh, trust me

1513
01:12:32,610 --> 01:12:33,820
You need more powder

1514
01:12:35,810 --> 01:12:37,260
Pain in the ass, right?

1515
01:12:39,390 --> 01:12:40,730
So anyway

1516
01:12:40,750 --> 01:12:42,560
Noticed Granger's not around here

1517
01:12:42,900 --> 01:12:44,560
Probably for the better too

1518
01:12:44,560 --> 01:12:46,780
No one would be able to keep their hummus and pita chips

1519
01:12:46,780 --> 01:12:48,870
down with that ugly mug of hers darting all about

1520
01:12:49,060 --> 01:12:51,130
Wow, why don't you just give her a break for once

1521
01:12:51,130 --> 01:12:52,370
Okay Malfoy?

1522
01:12:53,240 --> 01:12:55,310
Why defending her, Weasley?

1523
01:12:55,440 --> 01:12:56,690
Have a crush?

1524
01:12:56,690 --> 01:12:57,570
No!

1525
01:12:58,060 --> 01:13:00,380
No! Why all the insults Malfoy?

1526
01:13:00,380 --> 01:13:01,530
Covering up a crush?

1527
01:13:01,530 --> 01:13:01,680
Ron: Yeah? Yeah?

1528
01:13:01,680 --> 01:13:02,340
Oh... right, right
Ron: Yeah? Yeah?

1529
01:13:02,340 --> 01:13:03,430
Oh... right, right

1530
01:13:03,490 --> 01:13:05,560
Like I could ever have a crush on that stupid...

1531
01:13:05,560 --> 01:13:07,200
Cho: Oh my gosh!

1532
01:13:07,350 --> 01:13:08,310
Y'all!

1533
01:13:10,610 --> 01:13:12,770
Cho: She looks so beautiful! Bless her heart

1534
01:13:12,770 --> 01:13:13,810
She looks great!

1535
01:13:19,970 --> 01:13:23,150
Here I am, face to face, with a situation

1536
01:13:23,150 --> 01:13:26,880
I never thought I'd ever see

1537
01:13:26,880 --> 01:13:27,690
Strange

1538
01:13:27,710 --> 01:13:29,560
How a dress can take a mess

1539
01:13:29,560 --> 01:13:31,690
Make her nothing less than

1540
01:13:32,910 --> 01:13:34,890
Beautiful to me

1541
01:13:35,550 --> 01:13:39,450
It seems like my eyes have been transfigured

1542
01:13:39,450 --> 01:13:42,520
Something deep inside has changed

1543
01:13:43,500 --> 01:13:48,360
They've been open wide, but hold that trigger

1544
01:13:48,770 --> 01:13:50,430
This could mean

1545
01:13:52,310 --> 01:13:57,740
Danger

1546
01:13:57,870 --> 01:14:01,070
I'm falling in love, falling in love

1547
01:14:01,070 --> 01:14:03,500
Falling in love

1548
01:14:04,260 --> 01:14:07,700
I'm falling in love, falling in love

1549
01:14:07,700 --> 01:14:09,700
Falling in love

1550
01:14:10,210 --> 01:14:13,110
With Hermione Granger

1551
01:14:19,800 --> 01:14:20,800
What

1552
01:14:20,800 --> 01:14:21,980
What the hell is this?

1553
01:14:21,980 --> 01:14:25,150
You expect me to sing about her?

1554
01:14:25,150 --> 01:14:27,200
I don't care about her

1555
01:14:27,560 --> 01:14:30,910
It's just a little make up

1556
01:14:30,910 --> 01:14:32,910
Draco wake up!

1557
01:14:32,910 --> 01:14:35,110
I'm mistaken

1558
01:14:35,280 --> 01:14:36,810
She is the

1559
01:14:36,810 --> 01:14:38,860
hottest girl I've ever seen!

1560
01:14:39,050 --> 01:14:42,820
Now, because she's like a girl I've never seen

1561
01:14:42,930 --> 01:14:44,270
Don't know why

1562
01:14:44,380 --> 01:14:48,880
I'd ever be so mean

1563
01:14:48,880 --> 01:14:50,710
This could mean

1564
01:14:53,140 --> 01:14:57,680
Danger

1565
01:14:57,680 --> 01:15:01,010
I'm falling in love, falling in love

1566
01:15:01,010 --> 01:15:03,310
Falling in love

1567
01:15:03,540 --> 01:15:04,860
I could be

1568
01:15:04,860 --> 01:15:07,830
Falling in love, falling in love

1569
01:15:07,830 --> 01:15:10,230
Falling in love

1570
01:15:10,230 --> 01:15:14,370
With Hermione Granger

1571
01:15:15,950 --> 01:15:17,080
Ron: I want to let her know

1572
01:15:17,080 --> 01:15:19,360
Draco: I feel so queasy
Ron: I want to let her know

1573
01:15:19,740 --> 01:15:21,190
But I can't let it show

1574
01:15:21,190 --> 01:15:23,320
Ron: She'd laugh! Poor Weasley
But I can't let it show

1575
01:15:23,560 --> 01:15:24,350
Draco: Come on
Ron: Come on

1576
01:15:24,350 --> 01:15:25,090
Ron!

1577
01:15:25,090 --> 01:15:26,220
Draco!

1578
01:15:26,220 --> 01:15:29,840
Draco: You gotta let it go!
Ron: You gotta let it go!

1579
01:15:29,950 --> 01:15:35,070
You gotta let it go!

1580
01:15:35,340 --> 01:15:35,920
What?

1581
01:15:36,770 --> 01:15:37,820
THE HELL IS THIS?

1582
01:15:43,000 --> 01:15:45,060
Ron: How a dress can take a mess

1583
01:15:45,060 --> 01:15:45,360
Ron: Make her nothing less than

1584
01:15:45,360 --> 01:15:46,430
Granger!
Ron: Make her nothing less than

1585
01:15:46,430 --> 01:15:47,370
Wake up!
Ron: Make her nothing less than

1586
01:15:47,370 --> 01:15:47,810
Ron: Make her nothing less than

1587
01:15:47,810 --> 01:15:48,220
Draco: I've been mistaken!

1588
01:15:48,220 --> 01:15:50,330
Ron: Beautiful to me...
Draco: I've been mistaken!

1589
01:15:50,560 --> 01:15:50,930
Draco: She is the hottest girl I've ever seen!

1590
01:15:50,930 --> 01:15:54,440
Ron: It seems like my eyes have been transfigured
Draco: She is the hottest girl I've ever seen!

1591
01:15:54,440 --> 01:15:54,800
Now because she's like a girl I've never seen

1592
01:15:54,800 --> 01:15:58,110
Ron: Something deep inside has changed
Now because she's like a girl I've never seen

1593
01:15:58,110 --> 01:15:58,450
Draco: Don't know why

1594
01:15:58,450 --> 01:15:59,540
Ron: They've been open wide but hold that trigger
Draco: Don't know why

1595
01:15:59,540 --> 01:16:03,950
I'd ever be so mean
Ron: They've been open wide but hold that trigger

1596
01:16:04,140 --> 01:16:06,170
This could mean

1597
01:16:07,640 --> 01:16:12,790
Danger

1598
01:16:12,970 --> 01:16:16,100
I'm falling in love, falling in love

1599
01:16:16,100 --> 01:16:18,510
Falling in love

1600
01:16:18,660 --> 01:16:21,450
I could be falling in love

1601
01:16:21,450 --> 01:16:22,830
Falling in love

1602
01:16:22,960 --> 01:16:25,330
Falling in love

1603
01:16:25,330 --> 01:16:29,290
With Hermione Granger

1604
01:16:29,440 --> 01:16:32,750
With Hermione Granger

1605
01:16:32,870 --> 01:16:36,750
With Hermione Granger

1606
01:16:37,330 --> 01:16:42,190
Danger

1607
01:16:49,361 --> 01:16:50,321
Ron: Oh my God

1608
01:16:50,321 --> 01:16:51,541
Ah I can't believe it

1609
01:16:51,541 --> 01:16:52,071
What?

1610
01:16:52,071 --> 01:16:54,111
I just can't- I can't believe she is dancing with

1611
01:16:54,111 --> 01:16:55,841
every guy but me. That is so-

1612
01:16:55,841 --> 01:16:57,011
That is so stupid

1613
01:16:57,011 --> 01:16:58,851
That is stupid...

1614
01:16:58,851 --> 01:16:59,761
W-Why do you-

1615
01:16:59,761 --> 01:17:00,891
Why do you even care, man?

1616
01:17:00,891 --> 01:17:02,471
I don't! I-I don't care

1617
01:17:02,831 --> 01:17:05,201
I don't care and that's what I'm gonna go up and tell her

1618
01:17:05,201 --> 01:17:08,291
I'm gonna go and say "I don't care what you do"

1619
01:17:08,461 --> 01:17:11,511
And she's gonna feel so damn stupid

1620
01:17:11,571 --> 01:17:13,961
She is gonna feel like such an idiot

1621
01:17:13,961 --> 01:17:15,691
Listen Ron, you're acting like a real jerk

1622
01:17:15,691 --> 01:17:17,691
Maybe you should take it easy on the butterbeer

1623
01:17:17,691 --> 01:17:18,431
No

1624
01:17:19,821 --> 01:17:20,441
No

1625
01:17:20,441 --> 01:17:20,861
Hermione: Hey guys

1626
01:17:20,861 --> 01:17:22,741
Hey Hermione, hey you look great. You look wonderful

1627
01:17:22,741 --> 01:17:24,101
Oh thanks, yeah

1628
01:17:24,101 --> 01:17:26,661
You know I used to think looks weren't important and now

1629
01:17:26,661 --> 01:17:28,601
I think they're more important than anything

1630
01:17:31,251 --> 01:17:33,631
Oh it's just I'm having so much fun dancing with everyone

1631
01:17:33,631 --> 01:17:34,611
Ron: Wow- wow Hermione

1632
01:17:34,611 --> 01:17:35,931
When did you become so shallow?

1633
01:17:35,931 --> 01:17:36,471
When?

1634
01:17:38,021 --> 01:17:39,451
What is wrong with you, Ron?

1635
01:17:39,451 --> 01:17:40,181
Nothing

1636
01:17:40,521 --> 01:17:42,031
Nothing's wrong with me

1637
01:17:42,031 --> 01:17:44,551
But why don't you just go ask Schlongbottom to dance, huh?

1638
01:17:45,041 --> 01:17:45,741
Ron: Go do it

1639
01:17:45,741 --> 01:17:47,301
You know what? Maybe I will

1640
01:17:50,981 --> 01:17:53,241
I showed her. I showed her so good

1641
01:17:54,691 --> 01:17:55,481
Harry: Wait a second

1642
01:17:55,481 --> 01:17:56,671
Wait a hot second

1643
01:17:56,671 --> 01:17:58,081
I know what's going on here!

1644
01:18:02,241 --> 01:18:03,711
You've got a crush!

1645
01:18:05,011 --> 01:18:06,011
Alright, Ron

1646
01:18:06,011 --> 01:18:07,551
Listen, listen to me now

1647
01:18:07,551 --> 01:18:08,401
Just a little advice

1648
01:18:08,401 --> 01:18:10,981
Just call me crazy, but girls don't really like it

1649
01:18:10,981 --> 01:18:13,731
when you're angry at them, much less you shout at them

1650
01:18:13,731 --> 01:18:15,641
Now maybe what you should do is go over there

1651
01:18:15,641 --> 01:18:17,801
and tell her how much you care about her

1652
01:18:17,801 --> 01:18:18,271
Okay?

1653
01:18:18,271 --> 01:18:19,591
Maybe you should ask her to dance

1654
01:18:19,591 --> 01:18:20,611
What? No! No!

1655
01:18:20,611 --> 01:18:22,211
'Cause then she'd know that I liked her

1656
01:18:22,211 --> 01:18:24,381
And you always know that you don't tell a girl that you like her

1657
01:18:24,381 --> 01:18:25,811
because it makes you look like an idiot

1658
01:18:25,811 --> 01:18:26,861
I know you'll look like an idiot

1659
01:18:26,861 --> 01:18:28,731
Anytime you tell a girl you like her, it makes you look dumb

1660
01:18:28,731 --> 01:18:29,711
That's inevitable

1661
01:18:29,711 --> 01:18:31,631
But listen, it's something you have to do

1662
01:18:31,631 --> 01:18:34,211
Ron, you have to move forward so that everyone will like you back

1663
01:18:34,211 --> 01:18:35,531
Okay? And what have we got to lose?

1664
01:18:35,531 --> 01:18:38,281
We look like idiots anyway. We're here's one. Look at our robes

1665
01:18:39,011 --> 01:18:41,161
You know, if we dressed like this in the muggle world

1666
01:18:41,161 --> 01:18:42,461
We would get our asses kicked

1667
01:18:43,311 --> 01:18:45,081
You have nothing to lose. Absolutely nothing

1668
01:18:45,081 --> 01:18:46,131
I bet, you know

1669
01:18:46,131 --> 01:18:48,831
She probably wants to dance with you just as much as you want to dance with her

1670
01:18:48,831 --> 01:18:49,961
You just gotta

1671
01:18:52,071 --> 01:18:53,711
You just gotta, give it a

1672
01:18:54,461 --> 01:18:55,421
a chance

1673
01:18:55,671 --> 01:18:57,721
Maybe there's something that you didn't see before, you know

1674
01:18:57,721 --> 01:19:00,301
You just gotta go and maybe find something special and

1675
01:19:00,301 --> 01:19:02,841
through the whole time you just didn't really have the guts to

1676
01:19:03,431 --> 01:19:04,201
Say anything

1677
01:19:06,761 --> 01:19:07,891
Where are you going? Where are you going?

1678
01:19:07,891 --> 01:19:09,171
I'm still mad and sad

1679
01:19:09,171 --> 01:19:10,131
Hold on

1680
01:19:11,211 --> 01:19:13,261
HP's gonna take his own advice, pal

1681
01:19:18,291 --> 01:19:19,191
Hey Ginny

1682
01:19:19,191 --> 01:19:20,041
Oh

1683
01:19:20,611 --> 01:19:21,551
Hey, Harry

1684
01:19:21,551 --> 01:19:22,431
Can I sit down?

1685
01:19:22,431 --> 01:19:24,431
Um, yeah, sure

1686
01:19:25,411 --> 01:19:26,451
Sooo

1687
01:19:27,991 --> 01:19:29,271
How's Hogwarts?

1688
01:19:30,161 --> 01:19:31,211
You know, it's

1689
01:19:31,211 --> 01:19:32,101
It's okay

1690
01:19:32,101 --> 01:19:33,831
I- I was actually, I was

1691
01:19:33,831 --> 01:19:37,111
really excited to come here but now that I'm here I just

1692
01:19:37,751 --> 01:19:39,051
I just don't think I belong

1693
01:19:39,051 --> 01:19:41,031
Oh yeah I totally know what you mean

1694
01:19:41,351 --> 01:19:42,821
Um... no

1695
01:19:42,821 --> 01:19:43,571
You don't

1696
01:19:45,151 --> 01:19:46,341
You're Harry Potter

1697
01:19:46,341 --> 01:19:47,451
Yeah I know, like

1698
01:19:47,451 --> 01:19:50,391
For eleven years I was this dumb kid that got the crap kicked out of me

1699
01:19:50,391 --> 01:19:51,781
under a staircase, and all of a sudden like

1700
01:19:51,781 --> 01:19:52,461
You're a wizard!

1701
01:19:52,671 --> 01:19:53,631
You have all these powers!

1702
01:19:53,631 --> 01:19:55,231
And everybody thinks I'm cool all of a sudden

1703
01:19:55,231 --> 01:19:56,591
It's weird, it's kind of isolating

1704
01:19:56,591 --> 01:19:57,171
I- uh

1705
01:19:57,171 --> 01:19:57,891
Hey, I'm sorry

1706
01:19:57,891 --> 01:19:59,261
I'm sorry I'm complaining about being famous

1707
01:19:59,261 --> 01:20:00,171
I'm sorry

1708
01:20:00,711 --> 01:20:01,371
Oh no

1709
01:20:01,581 --> 01:20:02,371
I understand

1710
01:20:02,371 --> 01:20:04,631
It's like when you first got here

1711
01:20:04,631 --> 01:20:07,871
Nobody wanted to get to know you because they thought the knew you already

1712
01:20:07,871 --> 01:20:12,691
But, eventually you'll find people that'll want to get to know you for the real you

1713
01:20:13,011 --> 01:20:14,971
You know Ginny, I feel like I already have found this person

1714
01:20:14,971 --> 01:20:16,421
and I've taken them for granted so tell you what

1715
01:20:16,421 --> 01:20:17,101
Come on

1716
01:20:17,101 --> 01:20:18,761
You wanna dance? It's the whole point of the evening

1717
01:20:22,471 --> 01:20:24,881
Now I gotta warn you, I've learned all my best dance moves

1718
01:20:24,881 --> 01:20:26,221
from Hagrid... so

1719
01:20:26,671 --> 01:20:27,541
I'm not that great

1720
01:20:28,571 --> 01:20:30,361
I'm sure you'll be fine

1721
01:20:31,211 --> 01:20:32,251
Wow

1722
01:20:32,251 --> 01:20:33,621
Harry Potter

1723
01:20:33,621 --> 01:20:35,201
I don't care what anybody says

1724
01:20:35,201 --> 01:20:37,501
You're the best dancer that ever was

1725
01:20:37,501 --> 01:20:39,011
Well I've got a confession to make, Ginny

1726
01:20:39,011 --> 01:20:40,291
These shoes right here

1727
01:20:40,761 --> 01:20:42,781
are magical enchanted dancing shoes

1728
01:20:43,101 --> 01:20:45,601
Wowie! Harry Potter

1729
01:20:45,601 --> 01:20:46,881
I'm just messing with you

1730
01:20:48,131 --> 01:20:49,801
I'm just awesome at dancing

1731
01:20:51,591 --> 01:20:51,951
Ron: Yahh!

1732
01:20:51,951 --> 01:20:52,441
Hermione: Ow!
Ron: Yahh!

1733
01:20:52,441 --> 01:20:53,041
Neville: Hey!
Ron: Yahh!

1734
01:20:53,041 --> 01:20:53,931
Okay

1735
01:20:54,491 --> 01:20:55,151
Alright

1736
01:20:55,151 --> 01:20:56,811
Okay when you really dance with Neville

1737
01:20:56,811 --> 01:20:58,621
is when you cross the line, okay? Take this

1738
01:20:58,621 --> 01:20:59,621
Beat it. Get out of here

1739
01:20:59,961 --> 01:21:00,201
What is wrong with-

1740
01:21:00,201 --> 01:21:00,901
Ron: Come here. Come here!
What is wrong with-

1741
01:21:00,901 --> 01:21:01,141
Ron: Come here. Come here!

1742
01:21:01,141 --> 01:21:02,141
Ow! Ow!

1743
01:21:02,801 --> 01:21:03,691
Hermione: What is wrong with you?

1744
01:21:03,691 --> 01:21:04,801
Why are you being so mean to me?

1745
01:21:04,801 --> 01:21:05,141
I'm not being mean!
Why are you being so mean to me?

1746
01:21:05,141 --> 01:21:05,801
I'm not being mean!

1747
01:21:05,801 --> 01:21:06,681
Ow!

1748
01:21:06,681 --> 01:21:08,211
Yes you are!

1749
01:21:08,211 --> 01:21:09,431
You know everyday

1750
01:21:09,431 --> 01:21:11,221
Everyone is trying to put me down

1751
01:21:11,221 --> 01:21:13,521
And on the one day I actually feel like a person

1752
01:21:13,521 --> 01:21:14,501
You're trying to ruin it!

1753
01:21:14,501 --> 01:21:15,461
Holy shit

1754
01:21:16,651 --> 01:21:18,611
What is wrong with you, Ron?

1755
01:21:19,061 --> 01:21:20,341
Hermione: Come on

1756
01:21:20,341 --> 01:21:20,361
Draco: Weasley!
Hermione: Come on

1757
01:21:20,361 --> 01:21:21,341
Draco: Weasley!

1758
01:21:32,171 --> 01:21:33,981
The lady said no

1759
01:21:35,371 --> 01:21:37,071
Not you too

1760
01:21:37,071 --> 01:21:39,781
You know what? I am so sick of both of you

1761
01:21:39,781 --> 01:21:41,551
I hate you both!

1762
01:21:46,411 --> 01:21:48,141
What did you say to her?

1763
01:21:48,141 --> 01:21:49,121
Ron: Nothing!

1764
01:21:50,331 --> 01:21:51,101
I'm bleeding!

1765
01:21:51,101 --> 01:21:51,571
Ron: I'm bleeding
I'm bleeding!

1766
01:21:51,571 --> 01:21:52,101
Ron: I'm bleeding

1767
01:21:53,571 --> 01:21:54,551
Look at this

1768
01:21:55,851 --> 01:21:56,751
Try this

1769
01:21:56,751 --> 01:21:57,811
Ron: Look what she did to me

1770
01:22:04,191 --> 01:22:05,211
You know Ginny

1771
01:22:06,571 --> 01:22:08,191
Ginny I'm feeling kind of dizzy

1772
01:22:08,511 --> 01:22:10,191
Well maybe we should stop spinning

1773
01:22:11,141 --> 01:22:12,711
From all this spinning, huh?

1774
01:22:13,591 --> 01:22:14,911
We have stopped spinning

1775
01:22:22,621 --> 01:22:23,411
Wait! No!

1776
01:22:23,411 --> 01:22:24,241
No no no no

1777
01:22:24,391 --> 01:22:25,761
I can't- I can't do this. You're-

1778
01:22:26,421 --> 01:22:28,321
You're Ginny Weasley. You're my best friend's little sister

1779
01:22:28,321 --> 01:22:29,741
You're Ron Weasley's sister, I c-

1780
01:22:29,741 --> 01:22:31,131
I-I'm sorry Ginny I can't do this

1781
01:22:31,641 --> 01:22:32,411
I'm sorry

1782
01:22:38,181 --> 01:22:39,251
Hey Cho! Hey, hey

1783
01:22:39,251 --> 01:22:39,801
Come on dance with me

1784
01:22:39,801 --> 01:22:40,871
I'm Harry Potter. Let's go

1785
01:22:43,791 --> 01:22:46,821
Excuse me, I believe I was dancing with the lady

1786
01:22:46,821 --> 01:22:47,931
Yeah I know and I'm uh

1787
01:22:48,241 --> 01:22:49,931
I'm cutting in, so yeah

1788
01:22:50,671 --> 01:22:53,891
Well, I <i>find</i> that to be very rude

1789
01:22:54,361 --> 01:22:55,751
Alright Cedric well why don't we

1790
01:22:55,751 --> 01:22:56,791
<i>find</i>- out

1791
01:22:56,791 --> 01:22:57,601
what the lady has to say about it?

1792
01:22:57,601 --> 01:22:58,141
Cho: Oh, boys
what the lady has to say about it?

1793
01:22:58,141 --> 01:22:58,801
Cho: Oh, boys

1794
01:22:58,801 --> 01:23:01,161
There's no need to fight over little ol' me

1795
01:23:01,691 --> 01:23:05,641
But by the way, Cedric thinks that you cheated on the dragon's task

1796
01:23:05,641 --> 01:23:06,751
Harry: Cheated? Are you kidding me?

1797
01:23:06,751 --> 01:23:08,751
That thing was trying to eat me. I was in its mouth!

1798
01:23:08,901 --> 01:23:11,481
Exactly. What went on in there?

1799
01:23:11,951 --> 01:23:13,441
I'd like to <i>find</i> out

1800
01:23:13,441 --> 01:23:15,531
Alright, that is it Diggory. We are dueling

1801
01:23:15,531 --> 01:23:16,101
Let's go

1802
01:23:16,101 --> 01:23:17,681
Oh Godric's Hollow!

1803
01:23:17,681 --> 01:23:19,921
All this excitement is making me thirsty

1804
01:23:20,901 --> 01:23:22,161
Oh, Cho! I can get you something to drink

1805
01:23:22,161 --> 01:23:22,901
Let me get you some punch

1806
01:23:23,351 --> 01:23:25,121
No, I'll get the punch

1807
01:23:25,211 --> 01:23:26,701
No, I'll get the punch!

1808
01:23:27,081 --> 01:23:28,911
Fine! Have the punch

1809
01:23:31,051 --> 01:23:31,751
Cedric: I did it!

1810
01:23:31,751 --> 01:23:31,861
Cho: You did it!
Cedric: I did it!

1811
01:23:31,861 --> 01:23:32,561
Cho: You did it!

1812
01:23:34,241 --> 01:23:36,051
Cedric Diggory I'm gonna kill you!

1813
01:23:39,251 --> 01:23:41,621
Portkey! Portkey! Portkey!

1814
01:23:55,852 --> 01:23:58,152
Cedric: Uh, where are we?

1815
01:24:00,352 --> 01:24:02,612
I don't know Cedric, someone punched me in the face

1816
01:24:02,612 --> 01:24:04,552
and my sense of direction got a little goofed up!

1817
01:24:05,192 --> 01:24:08,832
Well it seems clear to me now that that punch ladle was a portkey

1818
01:24:09,202 --> 01:24:11,032
And now, thanks to you,

1819
01:24:11,032 --> 01:24:14,012
We've both been transported to some mystery location

1820
01:24:16,342 --> 01:24:17,872
Brilliant Cedric, well you're a Hufflepuff

1821
01:24:17,872 --> 01:24:20,682
Why don't you <i>find</i> a way out of this place, okay?

1822
01:24:20,942 --> 01:24:23,332
Harry, I think I found something!

1823
01:24:25,142 --> 01:24:27,192
It appears to be a headstone

1824
01:24:27,362 --> 01:24:29,402
We must be in some sort of graveyard

1825
01:24:30,302 --> 01:24:33,222
Tom Riddle, Mary Riddle, Thoms Riddle

1826
01:24:34,112 --> 01:24:35,602
Riddle me this, eh Potter?

1827
01:24:38,102 --> 01:24:40,272
Cedric, I don't know about this place. I think we gotta get out of here

1828
01:24:41,102 --> 01:24:43,622
Harry, you're a Gryffindor. Where's your sense of adventure?

1829
01:24:44,472 --> 01:24:45,032
God-

1830
01:24:45,352 --> 01:24:46,032
Cedric

1831
01:24:46,182 --> 01:24:48,032
You are so annoying, okay?

1832
01:24:48,222 --> 01:24:51,162
You're like this guy, that's just around all the time

1833
01:24:51,162 --> 01:24:53,002
when I don't need a guy around

1834
01:24:53,082 --> 01:24:55,002
You're this spare guy all the time

1835
01:24:55,002 --> 01:24:56,172
This spare dude

1836
01:24:56,172 --> 01:24:57,472
You're such a spare!

1837
01:24:57,472 --> 01:24:58,502
<i>Kill the spare!</i>

1838
01:24:58,502 --> 01:24:59,972
<i>Avada Kedavra!</i>

1839
01:25:02,292 --> 01:25:04,042
So many regrets

1840
01:25:04,402 --> 01:25:05,322
I dead!

1841
01:25:08,472 --> 01:25:10,092
Harry: Oh my wizard God!

1842
01:25:10,092 --> 01:25:12,372
Not so fast! Petrificus Totalus!

1843
01:25:13,142 --> 01:25:15,192
Harry: Professor Quirrell, you just killed Cedric!

1844
01:25:15,812 --> 01:25:16,982
Not I, Potter

1845
01:25:17,192 --> 01:25:19,412
But perhaps you'd like to see who did

1846
01:25:20,172 --> 01:25:22,632
He's dying to see you

1847
01:25:27,742 --> 01:25:32,202
Harry Potter, The Boy Who Lived

1848
01:25:32,642 --> 01:25:34,732
It's good to see you again

1849
01:25:34,822 --> 01:25:38,162
The cauldron is ready, my lord

1850
01:25:38,612 --> 01:25:40,272
Harry: Cauldron? What are you guys gonna do, eat me?

1851
01:25:40,272 --> 01:25:40,982
That's gross

1852
01:25:40,982 --> 01:25:44,452
Ah, as delicious a dish as I'd think you'd make, Potter

1853
01:25:44,672 --> 01:25:48,462
I'd need a stomach of my own to digest you

1854
01:25:48,932 --> 01:25:51,022
And I haven't got one of those

1855
01:25:51,192 --> 01:25:52,172
Yet...

1856
01:26:02,002 --> 01:26:05,112
Aaaahh!

1857
01:26:05,852 --> 01:26:08,502
Ooh

1858
01:26:08,502 --> 01:26:11,782
Aaaahaha

1859
01:26:11,822 --> 01:26:12,782
Wooho

1860
01:26:12,892 --> 01:26:15,472
Okay haaha

1861
01:26:22,142 --> 01:26:23,482
Stop struggling!

1862
01:26:23,482 --> 01:26:25,042
Detention, Potter!

1863
01:26:25,042 --> 01:26:26,172
Harry: Detention?

1864
01:26:26,382 --> 01:26:29,092
Jeez, this guy is almost as big of an asshole as Snape is

1865
01:26:35,892 --> 01:26:36,892
Quirrell: It worked!

1866
01:27:19,332 --> 01:27:22,142
When I was a boy...

1867
01:27:22,692 --> 01:27:26,322
An orphan boy

1868
01:27:26,422 --> 01:27:29,962
I'd love to move my feet

1869
01:27:30,712 --> 01:27:33,102
I'd hear a tune

1870
01:27:33,102 --> 01:27:35,552
And start to swoon

1871
01:27:36,172 --> 01:27:40,712
My life would seem complete

1872
01:27:41,542 --> 01:27:45,012
The other boys would laugh and jeer

1873
01:27:45,402 --> 01:27:49,682
But I'd catch 'em tapping their toes

1874
01:27:49,852 --> 01:27:53,602
And when I'd start to sway

1875
01:27:53,602 --> 01:27:57,932
They'd get carried away

1876
01:27:58,012 --> 01:28:04,602
And oh, how the feeling grows

1877
01:28:05,712 --> 01:28:10,362
I take my

1878
01:28:10,362 --> 01:28:13,742
Foot

1879
01:28:13,742 --> 01:28:18,452
My little foot

1880
01:28:19,122 --> 01:28:23,422
And with that foot

1881
01:28:24,042 --> 01:28:27,662
Oh how I'd start to shake

1882
01:28:27,662 --> 01:28:30,432
I take two feet

1883
01:28:30,432 --> 01:28:33,312
Two tiny feet

1884
01:28:33,312 --> 01:28:36,022
Hey look! That's neat!

1885
01:28:36,022 --> 01:28:39,242
It's coming true!

1886
01:28:39,242 --> 01:28:41,862
Oh boy I get to dance again

1887
01:28:41,862 --> 01:28:43,862
Woohoo!

1888
01:28:44,372 --> 01:28:47,512
To dance again

1889
01:28:47,512 --> 01:28:52,772
I've been waiting all these years to dance again

1890
01:28:52,772 --> 01:28:55,352
Now at once a chance appears

1891
01:28:55,352 --> 01:28:57,852
To hear the beat. So on your feet

1892
01:28:57,852 --> 01:29:01,832
It's time to dance again

1893
01:29:02,072 --> 01:29:03,622
Come on, Potter!

1894
01:29:03,622 --> 01:29:05,282
Imperio!

1895
01:29:05,282 --> 01:29:07,882
You take your foot

1896
01:29:07,882 --> 01:29:10,742
Your little foot

1897
01:29:10,742 --> 01:29:13,262
Hey look, your foot

1898
01:29:13,262 --> 01:29:15,812
See how it starts to shake

1899
01:29:15,812 --> 01:29:17,812
Quirrell: Ooh try his arms!

1900
01:29:18,562 --> 01:29:21,312
How 'bout a twirl?

1901
01:29:21,312 --> 01:29:23,312
He's like a girl!

1902
01:29:24,042 --> 01:29:27,152
Quirrell: How overdue

1903
01:29:27,152 --> 01:29:30,652
I get to finally dance again with you

1904
01:29:32,382 --> 01:29:35,362
To dance again

1905
01:29:35,362 --> 01:29:40,692
I've been waiting all these years to dance again

1906
01:29:40,692 --> 01:29:43,292
Now at once a chance appears

1907
01:29:43,292 --> 01:29:46,122
It's lovely swaying, the music's playing

1908
01:29:46,122 --> 01:29:49,262
Come on let's dance again

1909
01:29:50,372 --> 01:29:52,432
Everybody!

1910
01:29:53,672 --> 01:29:56,012
I take my foot

1911
01:29:56,012 --> 01:29:57,512
You take your foot!

1912
01:29:57,512 --> 01:29:59,772
My little foot

1913
01:29:59,772 --> 01:30:01,262
Take that little foot!

1914
01:30:01,262 --> 01:30:03,502
And oh my foot

1915
01:30:03,502 --> 01:30:05,072
Let me hear it now

1916
01:30:05,072 --> 01:30:07,952
Look how it starts to shake

1917
01:30:08,212 --> 01:30:10,132
Oh Voldy's back

1918
01:30:10,132 --> 01:30:11,772
Hello world!

1919
01:30:11,772 --> 01:30:13,542
For the attack

1920
01:30:13,542 --> 01:30:15,052
I'm gonna get ya!

1921
01:30:15,502 --> 01:30:18,892
He'll take over the world, it's true

1922
01:30:19,012 --> 01:30:22,962
But first there's something he's gotta do

1923
01:30:22,962 --> 01:30:27,562
I'll dance again

1924
01:30:27,562 --> 01:30:34,722
I've been waiting all these years to dance again

1925
01:30:34,722 --> 01:30:38,072
Now at once a chance appears

1926
01:30:38,072 --> 01:30:41,072
Everybody make way

1927
01:30:41,072 --> 01:30:44,002
For a pas de bourre

1928
01:30:44,002 --> 01:30:46,832
It's time to dance

1929
01:30:46,922 --> 01:30:49,662
It's time to dance

1930
01:30:49,772 --> 01:30:54,632
It's time to dance

1931
01:30:54,952 --> 01:31:01,072
Again!

1932
01:31:12,463 --> 01:31:13,563
Voldemort: Yes

1933
01:31:13,563 --> 01:31:15,293
Bellatrix: My Dark Lord...

1934
01:31:15,293 --> 01:31:17,293
You look fabulous

1935
01:31:17,293 --> 01:31:19,723
Bellatrix Lestrange

1936
01:31:19,723 --> 01:31:21,003
Bellatrix: Oh, my liege!

1937
01:31:21,003 --> 01:31:22,563
Tell me it's going to be like the old days

1938
01:31:22,563 --> 01:31:24,883
when we do nothing but torture, murder,

1939
01:31:24,883 --> 01:31:26,883
and make love?

1940
01:31:27,913 --> 01:31:30,153
Ah, the old days are back, baby!

1941
01:31:33,093 --> 01:31:35,053
I can't tell you what it was like without you

1942
01:31:35,053 --> 01:31:36,903
Well I'm never going again

1943
01:31:37,463 --> 01:31:38,993
'Cause I've conquered death

1944
01:31:39,503 --> 01:31:43,773
and my first pleasure will be to kill Harry Potter

1945
01:31:44,493 --> 01:31:45,713
And next

1946
01:31:45,863 --> 01:31:48,143
to take over the Ministry of Magic

1947
01:31:48,183 --> 01:31:50,143
And rule the world

1948
01:31:50,143 --> 01:31:52,533
For all time!

1949
01:31:53,103 --> 01:31:55,323
And you will my Lord, but not yet

1950
01:31:55,583 --> 01:31:57,283
For now we must stick to the plan

1951
01:31:57,563 --> 01:31:59,883
We blame Potter's murder on Quirrell

1952
01:32:00,013 --> 01:32:02,503
So that your return may remain a secret

1953
01:32:02,653 --> 01:32:05,963
The Death Eaters aren't prepared to take on the entire Ministry of Magic

1954
01:32:05,963 --> 01:32:08,753
much less Dumbledore, and the Order of the Phoenix

1955
01:32:09,223 --> 01:32:10,453
Quirrell: I'm sorry

1956
01:32:10,673 --> 01:32:13,653
What was that about me going to Azkaban for Potter's murder?

1957
01:32:13,653 --> 01:32:15,873
Ohoho, you shall refer to him as

1958
01:32:15,873 --> 01:32:18,213
My Lord, my liege, or my Dark Lord only!

1959
01:32:18,213 --> 01:32:20,413
No no no Bellatrix, it's a- it's cool

1960
01:32:22,803 --> 01:32:25,233
Quirrell's cool, Quirrell's cool, he's...

1961
01:32:25,233 --> 01:32:28,933
Over the last year he's proven himself to be a very good fr-

1962
01:32:34,563 --> 01:32:37,423
A very good servant to the will of the Dark Lord

1963
01:32:38,723 --> 01:32:39,853
Quirrell: Oh I see, so-

1964
01:32:40,003 --> 01:32:43,323
So you're Thomas Jefferson and I'm your Sally Hemings, is that right?

1965
01:32:43,323 --> 01:32:44,753
No

1966
01:32:45,073 --> 01:32:46,673
No, Quirrell, that-

1967
01:32:47,123 --> 01:32:48,373
That came out wrong

1968
01:32:48,373 --> 01:32:50,373
It's not like that

1969
01:32:50,513 --> 01:32:51,363
Isn't it?

1970
01:32:51,363 --> 01:32:52,793
Ugh, silence slave

1971
01:32:52,793 --> 01:32:54,043
Crucio!

1972
01:32:55,393 --> 01:32:56,603
Voldemort: It's alright, it's

1973
01:32:58,563 --> 01:33:00,143
What's the matter?

1974
01:33:00,143 --> 01:33:03,103
He is your pawn! You are his queen

1975
01:33:06,263 --> 01:33:10,333
It is an honor to serve the Dark Lord, no matter what the task!

1976
01:33:15,763 --> 01:33:17,853
Are you all right?

1977
01:33:21,013 --> 01:33:23,403
Did you really know the whole time, you'd-

1978
01:33:23,483 --> 01:33:25,463
blame Potter's murder on me?

1979
01:33:26,493 --> 01:33:28,893
Yes... yes I

1980
01:33:29,363 --> 01:33:30,893
I knew

1981
01:33:31,413 --> 01:33:34,203
But things have changed over the last year, I feel different now-

1982
01:33:34,203 --> 01:33:36,203
Don't touch me

1983
01:33:38,063 --> 01:33:40,193
How do I explain this? It's-

1984
01:33:41,003 --> 01:33:43,523
It's like that movie <i>She's All That</i>

1985
01:33:43,523 --> 01:33:46,103
You remember? We watched that together

1986
01:33:47,723 --> 01:33:51,873
You remember how at the end Freddie Prinze Jr. turns out to be good?

1987
01:33:52,533 --> 01:33:53,883
Quirrell: No

1988
01:33:53,883 --> 01:33:56,993
I didn't see the end because you were watching it

1989
01:33:56,993 --> 01:33:58,843
while you were on the back of my head

1990
01:33:58,843 --> 01:34:01,553
sucking my soul!

1991
01:34:02,303 --> 01:34:04,513
Well I wish there was another way

1992
01:34:05,583 --> 01:34:07,603
But I've got to take over the world

1993
01:34:07,603 --> 01:34:09,333
Quirrell: Well there is

1994
01:34:11,613 --> 01:34:13,533
I'll let you know now but it's gonna be

1995
01:34:13,873 --> 01:34:17,023
pretty hard to make that rollerblading date from Azkaban

1996
01:34:17,303 --> 01:34:20,113
Bellatrix: Death Eaters, take him away

1997
01:34:23,933 --> 01:34:27,083
And now you have what you've waited for for so long

1998
01:34:28,413 --> 01:34:29,283
What?

1999
01:34:30,153 --> 01:34:32,393
Your chance to kill Harry Potter

2000
01:34:33,863 --> 01:34:35,333
Yes

2001
01:34:35,743 --> 01:34:37,253
Kill Potter!

2002
01:34:37,253 --> 01:34:38,623
Ha- whoa, where'd he go?

2003
01:34:39,723 --> 01:34:41,813
Harry: You're not killing me today Voldemort, but I'll tell you what

2004
01:34:41,923 --> 01:34:43,813
I'll get you some punch!

2005
01:34:44,443 --> 01:34:49,323
Portkey! Portkey! Portkey! Portkey!

2006
01:34:56,243 --> 01:34:57,633
Ginny: Oh my Rowling

2007
01:34:57,633 --> 01:34:59,463
What happened Harry Potter?

2008
01:34:59,463 --> 01:35:01,793
You... Harry what the hell are you doing over here?

2009
01:35:01,793 --> 01:35:02,983
You missed the raffle

2010
01:35:02,983 --> 01:35:05,753
Snape: What happened to the graveyard?

2011
01:35:05,753 --> 01:35:07,733
It's- it's Voldemort!

2012
01:35:07,733 --> 01:35:10,743
It's Voldemort! He's back!

2013
01:35:24,724 --> 01:35:27,864
Extra! Extra! Read all about it

2014

Harry Potter, the boy who beat Voldemort

2015
01:35:30,654 --> 01:35:32,654
now says he's back!

2016
01:35:32,654 --> 01:35:36,234
Daily Prophet! Get your Daily Prophet here!

2017
01:35:36,234 --> 01:35:39,264
Harry Potter versus Voldemort, round two!

2018
01:35:39,564 --> 01:35:43,394
Minister of Magic Cornelius Fudge makes a statement

2019
01:35:43,804 --> 01:35:49,284
Cornelius: I've heard these Voldemort rumors and I for one simply don't believe it

2020
01:35:49,754 --> 01:35:53,754
Voldemort talks about it on his new FlooTube channel!

2021
01:35:56,594 --> 01:35:59,724
I'm gonna find Harry Potter and I'm gonna *** in his ***!

2022
01:36:03,774 --> 01:36:06,524
Also does reviews of "17 Again"

2023
01:36:06,524 --> 01:36:09,084
Well it was a little slow in the beginning, but

2024
01:36:09,484 --> 01:36:10,964
Come on, Zac Efron

2025
01:36:10,964 --> 01:36:12,964
Zefron! Enough said

2026
01:36:13,534 --> 01:36:18,504
I've seen these so-called posts and I still don't believe it

2027
01:36:18,504 --> 01:36:20,504
This is a ruse

2028
01:36:20,504 --> 01:36:23,494
You all have been hoodwinked!

2029
01:36:23,834 --> 01:36:28,434
Professor Quirrell confesses to murder of Hogwarts student Cedric Diggory

2030
01:36:28,434 --> 01:36:30,784
Receives life in Azkaban

2031
01:36:30,784 --> 01:36:36,194
Extra! Extra! Read all about it! Extra!

2032
01:36:48,814 --> 01:36:51,054
Harry: Man...

2033
01:36:53,934 --> 01:36:55,824
Ron, this totally sucks man. This-

2034
01:36:55,824 --> 01:36:58,474
Ron: This is horrible

2035
01:37:00,264 --> 01:37:01,644
Yeah I know I mean, look at this

2036
01:37:01,644 --> 01:37:03,544
This is... it's terrible

2037
01:37:03,544 --> 01:37:05,524
<i>Harry Potter versus Voldemort: The Fight of the Century</i>

2038
01:37:05,524 --> 01:37:05,954
Ron: No it's not that
<i>Harry Potter versus Voldemort: The Fight of the Century</i>

2039
01:37:05,954 --> 01:37:06,764
Ron: No it's not that

2040
01:37:06,764 --> 01:37:08,764
It's Hermione

2041
01:37:09,444 --> 01:37:11,534
It's just like

2042
01:37:11,554 --> 01:37:14,094
I can't get her out of my head, and everytime I look at her

2043
01:37:14,094 --> 01:37:17,844
I have these pains in my chest, and I just know it's her fault

2044
01:37:17,844 --> 01:37:19,594
That bitch

2045
01:37:23,814 --> 01:37:25,794
I'm just not cut out for this, Harry. I'm not

2046
01:37:25,794 --> 01:37:26,774
Yeah man I know what you mean

2047
01:37:26,774 --> 01:37:29,144
It's like when you're trying to save the world, and the whole world is just against you

2048
01:37:29,144 --> 01:37:31,934
No, no, no, no, no!

2049
01:37:31,934 --> 01:37:33,534
This isn't about you

2050
01:37:34,554 --> 01:37:37,884
Why does every conversation we have to have have to turn into Potter talk?

2051
01:37:37,884 --> 01:37:38,454
It's not Potter talk-

2052
01:37:38,454 --> 01:37:41,934
No! No! I'm miserable

2053
01:37:42,084 --> 01:37:45,494
And all you can do is talk about yourself

2054
01:37:45,574 --> 01:37:48,114
You're the like the self absorbed guy I know. If you were miserable,

2055
01:37:48,114 --> 01:37:51,354
I'd be there for you, but you won't even listen to me and I'm sick of it

2056
01:37:52,764 --> 01:37:56,704
So- so, so good luck with whatever you were talking about

2057
01:37:56,744 --> 01:37:59,814
And I hope that you and Voldemort live happily ever after

2058
01:37:59,814 --> 01:38:00,984
'Cause me

2059
01:38:00,984 --> 01:38:03,544
I am never going to be happy again

2060
01:38:05,844 --> 01:38:10,384
So I'm just gonna go curl up in my sock drawer and sleep for days

2061
01:38:11,754 --> 01:38:12,114
Harry: Ron...

2062
01:38:12,114 --> 01:38:13,524
Hermione: Were you just talking to Ron?

2063
01:38:13,524 --> 01:38:14,434
Yeah I was trying to tell him about Voldemort

2064
01:38:14,434 --> 01:38:15,184
Hermione: Well did he say anything about me?
Yeah I was trying to tell him about Voldemort

2065
01:38:15,184 --> 01:38:16,544
Hermione: Well did he say anything about me?

2066
01:38:16,544 --> 01:38:18,584
Harry: Uh, yeah, he said that someone told me

2067
01:38:18,594 --> 01:38:22,364
Well, was one of them an apology for how he treated me at the Yule Ball?

2068
01:38:22,534 --> 01:38:23,964
Um, yeah I heard about that

2069
01:38:23,964 --> 01:38:26,204
Listen, I was wondering maybe if you heard about a little something

2070
01:38:26,204 --> 01:38:27,994
I don't know, that uh, Voldemort is back!

2071
01:38:27,994 --> 01:38:29,554
Uh, Cedric Diggory is dead!

2072
01:38:29,554 --> 01:38:29,574
Professor Quirrell was crazy,

2073
01:38:29,574 --> 01:38:31,044
Cho: Oh!
Professor Quirrell was crazy,

2074
01:38:31,044 --> 01:38:32,834
And now I have to save the world. Did you hear that Hermione?

2075
01:38:32,834 --> 01:38:35,944
Um, actually I have heard those things, Harry, about a thousand times

2076
01:38:35,944 --> 01:38:39,054
but never had they been told to me with so much sass

2077
01:38:39,634 --> 01:38:41,724
Drop the attitude Harry Potter

2078
01:38:42,744 --> 01:38:45,304
You are acting like Garfield on a Monday

2079
01:38:49,354 --> 01:38:52,184
Well don't you think I have a right to be a little stressed out?

2080
01:38:52,424 --> 01:38:54,614
Wh- no. No I don't

2081
01:38:54,614 --> 01:38:56,724
You know what, this is just like with the dragon, okay?

2082
01:38:56,724 --> 01:38:58,964
I stressed out, I told you to prepare

2083
01:38:58,964 --> 01:39:01,354
and yet you didn't do anything, and you were fine

2084
01:39:01,354 --> 01:39:02,974
You know you just played your little guitar

2085
01:39:02,974 --> 01:39:05,164
I mean, and I don't know what you're crying about, Harry

2086
01:39:05,164 --> 01:39:09,114
This is just like when you defeated Voldemort and you were a baby

2087
01:39:09,114 --> 01:39:09,944
Hermione, come on

2088
01:39:09,944 --> 01:39:12,054
You're the friend that's supposed to tell me to go to the library

2089
01:39:12,054 --> 01:39:12,904
and try to figure this stuff out-

2090
01:39:12,904 --> 01:39:14,014
Well you know what, Harry?

2091
01:39:14,124 --> 01:39:15,204
I don't do that anymore

2092
01:39:18,254 --> 01:39:21,044
Draco: Read it and weep, Potter!

2093
01:39:21,924 --> 01:39:23,924
I heard Voldemort's back

2094
01:39:29,704 --> 01:39:33,624
And he's trying to kill you. What do you think about that, Moonshoes?

2095
01:39:34,664 --> 01:39:38,034
Malfoy, I honestly see- I don't see why you're so happy about this

2096
01:39:38,034 --> 01:39:40,044
If Voldemort is back, which he is,

2097
01:39:40,044 --> 01:39:41,514
You might as well kiss Hogwarts goodbye

2098
01:39:41,514 --> 01:39:43,514
You might as well kiss the whole planet goodbye

2099
01:39:43,944 --> 01:39:46,304
Kiss the planet goodbye?

2100
01:39:46,524 --> 01:39:49,974
Having second thoughts about Pigfarts, are you?

2101
01:39:51,294 --> 01:39:54,044
Malfoy you're the last person I want to talk to now, okay?

2102
01:39:54,044 --> 01:39:54,984
You know what?

2103
01:39:55,644 --> 01:39:57,224
As soon as you're out of the way

2104
01:39:57,434 --> 01:39:59,484
I'll be the coolest kid in school

2105
01:39:59,584 --> 01:40:02,574
Hermione: Malfoy, that will never happen. Everybody hates you

2106
01:40:02,574 --> 01:40:05,614
Oh right, okay, this coming from Hermione Stranger

2107
01:40:06,344 --> 01:40:08,454
Pansy: She's right, Malfoy. She's cooler than you

2108
01:40:08,454 --> 01:40:10,694
Cho: Yeah, even Moaning Myrtle is cooler than you

2109
01:40:10,694 --> 01:40:11,244
Neville: Take this!

2110
01:40:11,244 --> 01:40:12,244
Expelliarmus!

2111
01:40:14,874 --> 01:40:15,484
No!

2112
01:40:15,804 --> 01:40:17,484
Ignore it! Ignore it

2113
01:40:17,664 --> 01:40:18,604
Don't say anything!

2114
01:40:18,944 --> 01:40:19,664
Stop it!

2115
01:40:21,074 --> 01:40:23,864
Snape: What the devil is going on here?

2116
01:40:25,764 --> 01:40:28,934
Draco Malfoy pull those trousers up at once

2117
01:40:29,874 --> 01:40:30,944
Professor I just-

2118
01:40:30,944 --> 01:40:32,344
I don't want to hear it

2119
01:40:32,454 --> 01:40:34,484
I need to see you in my office

2120
01:40:34,924 --> 01:40:36,184
Now

2121
01:40:39,654 --> 01:40:41,894
This is all your fault, Potter!

2122
01:40:42,024 --> 01:40:43,244
You'll pay for this

2123
01:40:43,514 --> 01:40:45,264
You'll all pay!

2124
01:40:47,484 --> 01:40:49,104
Harry: Nice. you're the man

2125
01:40:50,144 --> 01:40:51,684
Cho: That made me feel better

2126
01:40:59,164 --> 01:41:00,104
Harry: Hey Ginny what's up-

2127
01:41:00,104 --> 01:41:02,044
Hey, I hope you have something to say about Voldemort

2128
01:41:02,894 --> 01:41:03,614
Ginny: Who?

2129
01:41:04,854 --> 01:41:05,724
Harry: Whatever

2130
01:41:08,034 --> 01:41:09,154
No, I'm fine

2131
01:41:10,584 --> 01:41:11,484
Um

2132
01:41:11,694 --> 01:41:13,384
Hey, Harry?

2133
01:41:13,874 --> 01:41:14,614
Yeah?

2134
01:41:14,614 --> 01:41:16,624
Um, so

2135
01:41:17,004 --> 01:41:18,604
We kissed

2136
01:41:18,604 --> 01:41:20,224
at the Yule Ball?

2137
01:41:20,494 --> 01:41:23,544
And, well, I thought we were gonna be together forever

2138
01:41:25,084 --> 01:41:26,274
but we're not

2139
01:41:28,234 --> 01:41:29,924
Yeah, that uh

2140
01:41:29,924 --> 01:41:31,624
pretty much sums it up

2141
01:41:33,624 --> 01:41:35,954
Hey, what's going on?

2142
01:41:36,654 --> 01:41:39,444
Ginny, this is what's going on. Don't you get it?

2143
01:41:40,724 --> 01:41:42,774
Everyone is in danger who's near to me

2144
01:41:42,774 --> 01:41:44,354
We can't be together because

2145
01:41:44,394 --> 01:41:46,784
Well Voldemort is back, which he is, then

2146
01:41:46,784 --> 01:41:48,404
You're in mortal peril. Don't you get it?

2147
01:41:48,404 --> 01:41:50,424
It's just like the Spiderman movie. Haven't you seen that?

2148
01:41:50,424 --> 01:41:52,794
MJ and Peter Parker can't be together

2149
01:41:53,044 --> 01:41:54,794
But the whole point of Spiderman 2

2150
01:41:54,794 --> 01:41:56,864
was that MJ and Peter Parker could be together and

2151
01:41:56,864 --> 01:41:59,054
Yeah I know, but the point of Spiderman 3

2152
01:41:59,054 --> 01:42:01,614
is that everything sucks and that falls to shit!

2153
01:42:02,594 --> 01:42:04,474
Ginny, what I'm trying to say is

2154
01:42:04,574 --> 01:42:06,754
I don't want my life to be like Spiderman 3

2155
01:42:06,754 --> 01:42:08,224
I hated that movie

2156
01:42:10,524 --> 01:42:12,234
Ugh, I'm sorry. It's just

2157
01:42:12,294 --> 01:42:14,274
That's my little way of saying, well

2158
01:42:14,644 --> 01:42:16,234
We can't be together

2159
01:42:17,584 --> 01:42:18,774
I'm sorry Ginny

2160
01:42:19,924 --> 01:42:21,994
I'm such an idiot

2161
01:42:28,924 --> 01:42:30,344
Ugh, I need a-

2162
01:42:30,344 --> 01:42:31,694
I need a butterbeer

2163
01:42:32,184 --> 01:42:34,334
Hey! Psst, Potter!

2164
01:42:34,504 --> 01:42:36,044
Hey! It's me

2165
01:42:36,044 --> 01:42:37,064
Harry: Who're you?

2166
01:42:37,294 --> 01:42:38,194
It's Dumbledore

2167
01:42:38,194 --> 01:42:38,834
Harry: Oh

2168
01:42:39,064 --> 01:42:42,114
Listen, listen Harry I've got some very important things I gotta tell you

2169
01:42:42,114 --> 01:42:43,034
What? Oh about Voldemort?

2170
01:42:43,034 --> 01:42:45,184
Yes! Things that that are absolutely crucial for you to know

2171
01:42:45,184 --> 01:42:46,784
but I can't get into it right now

2172
01:42:46,784 --> 01:42:50,404
I need you to meet in my inner office at 10 o'clock and come by yourself

2173
01:42:50,404 --> 01:42:52,624
Bring that uh, Invisibility Cloak of yours

2174
01:42:52,624 --> 01:42:55,184
and don't go blabbing your mouth about this to anybody

2175
01:42:55,184 --> 01:42:58,844
Voldemort has spies that can be anywhere. Even inside of Hogwarts

2176
01:42:59,994 --> 01:43:03,084
From now on the only person you can trust Harry, is me

2177
01:43:03,134 --> 01:43:04,894
and Severus Snape

2178
01:43:06,584 --> 01:43:09,034
Listen, Dumbledore, I know you don't want to hear this, but

2179
01:43:09,034 --> 01:43:11,724
I am not so sure about Snape

2180
01:43:11,724 --> 01:43:14,024
I think, I think- You know I'm pretty sure he's working for Voldemort

2181
01:43:14,024 --> 01:43:15,874
What? That's stupid. You're stupid!

2182
01:43:15,874 --> 01:43:17,964
No, no, no I'm actually- I'm positive

2183
01:43:17,964 --> 01:43:20,464
That night in the graveyard some Death Eater cuts off his hand

2184
01:43:20,464 --> 01:43:21,464
and Snape shows up without a hand

2185
01:43:21,464 --> 01:43:22,764
Dumbledore: Oh cockamamie!

2186
01:43:22,764 --> 01:43:27,284
Snape has assured me that he lost his hand in an entirely unrelated incident

2187
01:43:27,604 --> 01:43:29,664
Dumbledore, why do you trust Snape so much?

2188
01:43:29,664 --> 01:43:31,034
Because I love him

2189
01:43:32,584 --> 01:43:33,204
Professor, I-

2190
01:43:33,204 --> 01:43:34,974
Hey, I don't want to hear anything else about it

2191
01:43:34,974 --> 01:43:38,554
There is no way that Severus Snape is, was, or ever shall be

2192
01:43:38,554 --> 01:43:40,684
A servant of Voldemort's

2193
01:43:42,685 --> 01:43:45,235
All hail Voldemort!

2194
01:43:47,045 --> 01:43:49,285
Severus Snape, what are you doing here?

2195
01:43:49,545 --> 01:43:52,015
Got tired of being on Dumbledore's lap?

2196
01:43:52,765 --> 01:43:55,345
I ought to Jelly-legs Jinx you right now, traitor

2197
01:43:55,345 --> 01:43:57,305
Don't be goofy with me

2198
01:43:57,305 --> 01:43:59,345
I need to see Voldemort

2199
01:43:59,475 --> 01:44:02,865
How do we know this isn't some Order of the Phoenix practical joke?

2200
01:44:03,015 --> 01:44:06,405
I thought you deserted the Death Eaters when the Dark Lord lost his body

2201
01:44:06,405 --> 01:44:10,265
Or were you always a spy for Dumblebore?

2202
01:44:10,365 --> 01:44:12,285
Slumbersnore

2203
01:44:12,285 --> 01:44:13,455
Bumblesore!

2204
01:44:14,485 --> 01:44:17,485
I heard you had your Dark Mark laser surgically removed

2205
01:44:18,045 --> 01:44:22,735
Oh, well if you two know so much about me, you should write a biography

2206
01:44:23,285 --> 01:44:26,375
Snape: The Double Agent

2207
01:44:27,465 --> 01:44:28,845
That's right

2208
01:44:29,065 --> 01:44:31,515
I've always been a servant of Voldemort

2209
01:44:31,515 --> 01:44:35,175
I've simply been working undercover, finding out valuable information such as

2210
01:44:35,285 --> 01:44:37,375
The inner workings of Hogwarts

2211
01:44:37,505 --> 01:44:39,915
The roster of the Order of the Phoenix

2212
01:44:40,255 --> 01:44:43,005
and finding out what a true Hufflepuff is anyway

2213
01:44:44,045 --> 01:44:46,685
I've seen things no Slytherin should see

2214
01:44:46,885 --> 01:44:50,245
So if you're done putting each other's feet in each other's mouths

2215
01:44:50,315 --> 01:44:52,355
I would like to see my master

2216
01:44:52,955 --> 01:44:54,535
Of course. Right away, Severus

2217
01:44:54,535 --> 01:44:55,175
Good!

2218
01:44:55,425 --> 01:44:57,385
I'll be in the drawing room

2219
01:44:57,755 --> 01:45:00,395
Painting a picture of the stupid looks on your faces

2220
01:45:03,255 --> 01:45:05,895
Then, after sneaking into the Department of Mysteries

2221
01:45:05,895 --> 01:45:06,615
We'll enchant the-

2222
01:45:06,615 --> 01:45:07,045
Excuse me

2223
01:45:07,045 --> 01:45:08,815
Whoa! Whoa

2224
01:45:09,395 --> 01:45:11,475
Whoa-ho-ho, excuse me

2225
01:45:11,905 --> 01:45:13,475
I was in the middle of plotting

2226
01:45:14,655 --> 01:45:15,825
Where was I?

2227
01:45:17,485 --> 01:45:20,965
The statues will occupy the guards in the main lobby while you and I

2228
01:45:20,965 --> 01:45:22,495
sneak into the Minister's office

2229
01:45:22,495 --> 01:45:25,055
where you will be one Killing Curse away

2230
01:45:25,055 --> 01:45:28,615
from complete control of the entire Wizarding world!

2231
01:45:28,615 --> 01:45:30,705
How does that sound, my Lord?

2232
01:45:31,665 --> 01:45:32,705
My Lord?

2233
01:45:33,605 --> 01:45:34,455
Voldemort?

2234
01:45:42,235 --> 01:45:43,945
Ahh yeah!

2235
01:45:45,345 --> 01:45:47,715
Gringotts, that's great

2236
01:45:47,715 --> 01:45:48,375
that's great

2237
01:45:48,375 --> 01:45:50,725
Polyjuice potion, always very classy

2238
01:45:53,745 --> 01:45:55,555
I'm sorry what are we talking about?

2239
01:45:56,665 --> 01:45:58,945
Did you hear anything of my evil plan?

2240
01:45:59,525 --> 01:46:00,955
Well um

2241
01:46:01,595 --> 01:46:04,085
The details are a little fuzzy, but uh

2242
01:46:04,085 --> 01:46:06,325
but you did have a very evil tone

2243
01:46:06,325 --> 01:46:07,645
He's all yours

2244
01:46:07,815 --> 01:46:10,015
Wh- no, what abo- but Bellatrix, come back

2245
01:46:10,015 --> 01:46:11,995
No it's! Aw, co- don't be like this

2246
01:46:11,995 --> 01:46:13,995
Aww...

2247
01:46:14,825 --> 01:46:18,285
Now two people are mad at me

2248
01:46:26,215 --> 01:46:27,805
What?

2249
01:46:28,875 --> 01:46:32,475
Sir, Severus Snape is at the door and importunes access to you

2250
01:46:32,475 --> 01:46:34,035
Severus Snape?

2251
01:46:35,295 --> 01:46:36,615
See him in

2252
01:46:41,085 --> 01:46:45,075
Is that a new body, my Lord? You look absolutely ravishing

2253
01:46:46,485 --> 01:46:47,845
Severus

2254
01:46:49,355 --> 01:46:53,895
For such a super secret spy, you're a terrible liar

2255
01:46:54,605 --> 01:46:57,015
I'm a wreck

2256
01:46:58,995 --> 01:47:01,505
Better have some good news

2257
01:47:02,405 --> 01:47:05,705
My Lord, you know how for years we've been trying to get Death Eaters

2258
01:47:05,705 --> 01:47:07,285
into the grounds at Hogwarts?

2259
01:47:10,285 --> 01:47:13,915
For years we've been trying to sneak Death Eaters onto the grounds of Hogwarts

2260
01:47:14,275 --> 01:47:16,965
Well I think I've finally discovered a way how

2261
01:47:17,755 --> 01:47:19,715
Well by all means, Snape, tell me

2262
01:47:19,715 --> 01:47:21,715
I can't

2263
01:47:21,865 --> 01:47:22,995
Can't?

2264
01:47:23,275 --> 01:47:24,575
Tease!

2265
01:47:24,575 --> 01:47:25,575
Why not?

2266
01:47:27,255 --> 01:47:30,665
I made an Unbreakable Vow not to let any Death Eaters in

2267
01:47:30,665 --> 01:47:32,435
Unbreakable Vows, I hate those

2268
01:47:32,435 --> 01:47:36,525
I know, but I had to do it in order to convince Dumbledore of my loyalty

2269
01:47:37,255 --> 01:47:40,065
Yes Snape, I understand

2270
01:47:40,685 --> 01:47:43,395
Well if you can't help me, what do you propose we do?

2271
01:47:43,475 --> 01:47:45,395
Well I can't tell you

2272
01:47:45,655 --> 01:47:48,555
but I've brought along someone who can

2273
01:47:50,295 --> 01:47:52,325
Draco: All hail Lord Voldemort

2274
01:48:00,235 --> 01:48:02,615
Lucius Malloy's boy?

2275
01:48:02,615 --> 01:48:02,785
Voldemort: Are you serious?

2276
01:48:02,785 --> 01:48:03,895
Draco: Malfoy
Voldemort: Are you serious?

2277
01:48:03,895 --> 01:48:04,065
Voldemort: Are you serious?

2278
01:48:04,065 --> 01:48:04,775
Malfoy
Voldemort: Are you serious?

2279
01:48:06,515 --> 01:48:09,865
Help from a child, you've got to be kidding me

2280
01:48:10,445 --> 01:48:11,675
Don't make me laugh

2281
01:48:11,675 --> 01:48:12,955
I'm pissing

2282
01:48:18,865 --> 01:48:21,715
If this homemade Dark Mark won't convince you

2283
01:48:25,315 --> 01:48:27,005
Then at least hear me out

2284
01:48:31,095 --> 01:48:31,735
Okay

2285
01:48:32,525 --> 01:48:33,375
Okay

2286
01:48:33,825 --> 01:48:36,165
Okay, how do you propose

2287
01:48:36,165 --> 01:48:39,795
you get my Death Eaters into your little daycare center

2288
01:48:39,795 --> 01:48:43,415
And don't- and don't suggest a giant slide

2289
01:48:43,415 --> 01:48:45,565
or a trampoline

2290
01:48:45,565 --> 01:48:47,655
because we've already tried those

2291
01:48:52,325 --> 01:48:53,585
The vents

2292
01:48:53,865 --> 01:48:58,295
Your Death Eaters shall enter through the ventilation system of Hogwarts

2293
01:48:59,045 --> 01:49:01,405
Duh! The vents!

2294
01:49:03,815 --> 01:49:05,885
How do we find these vents?

2295
01:49:06,225 --> 01:49:08,185
Oh I'll tell you how to get to the vents

2296
01:49:09,075 --> 01:49:10,145
But first

2297
01:49:16,685 --> 01:49:19,285
We discuss the subject of payment

2298
01:49:19,285 --> 01:49:21,285
Ah, the catch

2299
01:49:21,465 --> 01:49:23,575
There's always a catch

2300
01:49:24,195 --> 01:49:27,705
There's nothing in this world so cruel and demanding

2301
01:49:28,225 --> 01:49:31,335
as the soul of a child

2302
01:49:33,445 --> 01:49:34,895
What do you want, Malloy?

2303
01:49:36,745 --> 01:49:37,665
I want

2304
01:49:37,665 --> 01:49:41,715
a galaxy traversing rocketship with enough fuel to get me to Mars

2305
01:49:43,715 --> 01:49:45,425
What do you want with a rocketship?

2306
01:49:45,745 --> 01:49:47,915
What business do you have on Mars?

2307
01:49:48,175 --> 01:49:50,475
Well, let's just say

2308
01:49:50,945 --> 01:49:54,415
Pigfarts, Pigfarts, here I come

2309
01:49:54,775 --> 01:49:57,655
Pigfarts, Pigfarts, yum yum yum

2310
01:49:57,655 --> 01:50:00,705
No no no no with all my respect, my Lord

2311
01:50:00,965 --> 01:50:04,285
There's one tiny flaw in that flawless plan

2312
01:50:06,115 --> 01:50:07,695
Albus Dumbledore

2313
01:50:08,575 --> 01:50:10,215
You're right, Snape

2314
01:50:13,945 --> 01:50:16,965
Normally I'd say, "I'll kill him," but I

2315
01:50:17,655 --> 01:50:20,465
I haven't been feeling so evil lately

2316
01:50:27,715 --> 01:50:31,245
So here's how it's gonna break down, Milfoy

2317
01:50:31,995 --> 01:50:34,275
I need your guarantee

2318
01:50:34,345 --> 01:50:37,685
That you'll lead my Death Eaters into Hogwarts

2319
01:50:37,895 --> 01:50:41,655
I will simultaneously be attacking the Ministry of Magic

2320
01:50:43,055 --> 01:50:45,275
Now I need you to promise

2321
01:50:45,505 --> 01:50:48,085
that by the end of the siege of Hogwarts

2322
01:50:48,195 --> 01:50:50,135
Dumbledore will be dead

2323
01:50:50,135 --> 01:50:52,135
Leave Harry Potter for me

2324
01:50:52,755 --> 01:50:55,745
But Dumbledore... must die

2325
01:50:57,535 --> 01:50:58,665
Do we have a deal?

2326
01:51:00,065 --> 01:51:01,535
We shall shake on it

2327
01:51:05,415 --> 01:51:07,105
An Unbreakable Vow

2328
01:51:16,335 --> 01:51:17,245
I don't-

2329
01:51:21,915 --> 01:51:25,245
By the end of tomorrow night, Albus Dumbledore will be dead?

2330
01:51:25,515 --> 01:51:26,435
Yes

2331
01:51:26,605 --> 01:51:27,715
And I'll have my rocketship?

2332
01:51:27,715 --> 01:51:29,245
When the technology is available

2333
01:51:31,185 --> 01:51:33,365
And you'll have to be my slave for a whole day starting now!

2334
01:51:33,365 --> 01:51:34,875
No!

2335
01:51:38,715 --> 01:51:40,755
You little shit!

2336
01:51:42,445 --> 01:51:43,845
You got me!

2337
01:51:44,595 --> 01:51:46,325
You've got me! Ohh

2338
01:51:46,325 --> 01:51:48,515
That is so embarrassing!

2339
01:51:50,245 --> 01:51:52,905
That's the second time that that's happened!

2340
01:51:54,895 --> 01:51:56,915
That's why I hate Unbreakable Curses

2341
01:51:57,405 --> 01:51:59,815
There are so many things I'm going to have you do for me

2342
01:51:59,815 --> 01:52:02,965
You're going to clean my room, and lay out my knickers,

2343
01:52:03,225 --> 01:52:05,885
and you're going to tape Wizards of Waverly Place for me!

2344
01:52:06,225 --> 01:52:07,755
I hate chores!

2345
01:52:07,755 --> 01:52:10,015
I'll be busy with a murder

2346
01:52:10,185 --> 01:52:12,025
Sometimes-

2347
01:52:19,456 --> 01:52:21,756
Hermione: Harry, why would Dumbledore want to meet us so late at night?

2348
01:52:21,756 --> 01:52:23,946
Harry: Well he's got some information to tell us about Voldemort

2349
01:52:23,946 --> 01:52:24,846
Did you bring the Invisibility Cloak?

2350
01:52:24,846 --> 01:52:25,696
I've got it right here

2351
01:52:25,696 --> 01:52:27,786
Ron: Alright Harry, this better be good

2352
01:52:27,826 --> 01:52:31,856
I don't have a snack, and I'm missing Wizards of Waverly Place for this, okay?

2353
01:52:31,856 --> 01:52:34,326
So what do we have to do that's so damn-

2354
01:52:35,036 --> 01:52:36,396
Oh my God, thank you

2355
01:52:42,286 --> 01:52:43,136
Ron: I love Hogwarts

2356
01:52:43,136 --> 01:52:43,966
Hogwarts is amazing

2357
01:52:43,966 --> 01:52:44,456
Ron: You want one?

2358
01:52:44,456 --> 01:52:45,056
Harry: Yeah

2359
01:52:48,146 --> 01:52:49,426
You know what? I am leaving

2360
01:52:49,426 --> 01:52:50,996
Whoa no no no no no you're not

2361
01:52:50,996 --> 01:52:52,746
No you're not. Okay when I said I needed your help

2362
01:52:52,746 --> 01:52:54,876
I meant both of you, so you guys gotta get over these

2363
01:52:54,876 --> 01:52:57,476
hurt feelings before somebody gets hurt, okay?

2364
01:52:57,476 --> 01:52:58,626
So come on

2365
01:53:00,166 --> 01:53:01,126
Hello Harry

2366
01:53:01,126 --> 01:53:02,826
Oh God dammit

2367
01:53:02,826 --> 01:53:05,856
I told you to come by yourself. Why did you have to bring the fatties?

2368
01:53:05,856 --> 01:53:07,966
Dumbledore, Ron and Hermione are my best friends

2369
01:53:07,966 --> 01:53:10,866
They're my best friends, and if this information is as important as you say it is

2370
01:53:10,866 --> 01:53:11,886
They have a right to hear it

2371
01:53:11,886 --> 01:53:13,376
Well I've been wrong before

2372
01:53:13,376 --> 01:53:14,936
Get in here hot legs

2373
01:53:14,936 --> 01:53:16,986
I was talking to Weasley

2374
01:53:17,556 --> 01:53:18,756
Thanks?

2375
01:53:20,906 --> 01:53:23,016
Sorry the place is such a sty

2376
01:53:28,026 --> 01:53:30,286
Oh my God!

2377
01:53:30,926 --> 01:53:33,996
That is a boss Zefron poster

2378
01:53:34,486 --> 01:53:35,376
Harry: It's awesome

2379
01:53:35,376 --> 01:53:36,486
Just the greatest

2380
01:53:36,486 --> 01:53:39,556
You know in every interview I've ever seen him, he just seems like such a

2381
01:53:39,556 --> 01:53:42,216
Charismatic uh, humanitarian

2382
01:53:43,396 --> 01:53:44,736
You think you like him?

2383
01:53:44,736 --> 01:53:46,376
Wrong, because I love him the most

2384
01:53:46,376 --> 01:53:48,636
Harry Potter loves Zac Efron more than anybody else in the planet

2385
01:53:48,636 --> 01:53:50,636
Ron: He does, that's- that's true

2386
01:53:51,026 --> 01:53:52,346
Anyway, no! That's not what we're here to talk about

2387
01:53:52,346 --> 01:53:53,346
We're talking about Voldemort

2388
01:53:53,346 --> 01:53:55,326
Harry is right. Not necessarily about Zefron

2389
01:53:55,326 --> 01:53:57,206
Everybody knows that I like him the most, but uh

2390
01:53:57,206 --> 01:53:58,656
About the Dark Lord

2391
01:53:58,656 --> 01:54:00,656
If you, uh, were to defeat this guy

2392
01:54:00,656 --> 01:54:02,446
You're going to have to know about Horcruxes

2393
01:54:02,446 --> 01:54:03,386
Okay. What's um

2394
01:54:03,386 --> 01:54:03,916
What's a Horcrux

2395
01:54:03,916 --> 01:54:04,666
What is a Horcrux?

2396
01:54:04,666 --> 01:54:08,906
Horcrux is one of the most terrifying pieces of magic that a wizard can create. It's-

2397
01:54:08,906 --> 01:54:12,896
actually when a wizard takes a piece of his soul and puts it into something else

2398
01:54:12,896 --> 01:54:14,426
Why would anybody ever want to do that?

2399
01:54:14,426 --> 01:54:16,306
Harry, if you have a Horcrux

2400
01:54:16,306 --> 01:54:18,046
you can never truly die

2401
01:54:18,136 --> 01:54:20,926
Your body can be dead but your soul can live on

2402
01:54:20,926 --> 01:54:23,186
Oh, it makes sense now, Harry

2403
01:54:23,446 --> 01:54:26,686
Everyone knows that the night your parents were killed, Voldemort was destroyed

2404
01:54:26,686 --> 01:54:28,346
but somehow he survived!

2405
01:54:28,346 --> 01:54:29,386
He must have had a Horcrux!

2406
01:54:29,386 --> 01:54:31,546
He didn't just have one Horcrux,

2407
01:54:31,546 --> 01:54:32,976
He had six of them!

2408
01:54:33,316 --> 01:54:36,166
I've already killed the first five for you, so don't worry about that

2409
01:54:36,976 --> 01:54:39,896
But you guys have to find the last one with this

2410
01:54:39,896 --> 01:54:41,536
The sword of Godric Gryffindor!

2411
01:54:41,536 --> 01:54:42,246
That's right

2412
01:54:42,246 --> 01:54:45,206
Godric Gryffindor was one of the four founders of Hogwarts

2413
01:54:45,206 --> 01:54:47,766
If anything can destroy a Horcrux, that sword is it

2414
01:54:47,766 --> 01:54:50,006
This thing is so damn awesome

2415
01:54:51,256 --> 01:54:53,436
Oh my God. Every wizard should have a sword!

2416
01:54:53,436 --> 01:54:54,886
Not these stupid drum sticks

2417
01:54:54,886 --> 01:54:55,966
Forget about them!

2418
01:54:57,056 --> 01:54:57,966
Yah!

2419
01:54:59,656 --> 01:55:00,726
Yah!

2420
01:55:00,896 --> 01:55:02,126
Okay, you know what Dumbledore?

2421
01:55:02,126 --> 01:55:03,856
So we know what a Horcrux is, that's all well and good

2422
01:55:03,856 --> 01:55:06,456
But how can we find one? Where are they? Where's the last one?

2423
01:55:06,456 --> 01:55:08,056
We find them with this

2424
01:55:08,056 --> 01:55:08,806
Oh!

2425
01:55:08,806 --> 01:55:09,906
Looks like...

2426
01:55:10,806 --> 01:55:14,816
Looks like G-Unit bling, but it is actually a Horcrux-seeking medallion

2427
01:55:15,256 --> 01:55:17,756
Wait, that's a Horcrux-seeking medallion?

2428
01:55:17,756 --> 01:55:19,716
I don't- That sounds a little too convenient

2429
01:55:19,716 --> 01:55:22,466
Oh so you have problems with the Time Turner but not the Horcrux-seeking medallion?

2430
01:55:22,656 --> 01:55:24,636
Wait, so if he has this piece of bling,

2431
01:55:24,636 --> 01:55:26,306
then why are Ron and I even here?

2432
01:55:26,306 --> 01:55:28,116
Yeah Voldemort isn't any of our business

2433
01:55:28,416 --> 01:55:29,906
Hermione Granger

2434
01:55:30,246 --> 01:55:31,976
When one of you's has got a problem,

2435
01:55:31,976 --> 01:55:34,206
that means all three of you's has gots a problem

2436
01:55:34,206 --> 01:55:36,706
What would Zac Efron say at a time like this?

2437
01:55:37,876 --> 01:55:41,206
<i>We're all in this together!</i>

2438
01:55:43,926 --> 01:55:46,276
Anyway, you just gotta, you gotta find the Horcruxes

2439
01:55:46,276 --> 01:55:48,426
and you gotta destroy them, that's the only way to beat the-

2440
01:55:48,426 --> 01:55:49,276
What is in that-

2441
01:55:49,726 --> 01:55:50,646
Guests, oh!

2442
01:55:50,646 --> 01:55:51,946
It must be the Death Eaters!

2443
01:55:51,946 --> 01:55:53,926
They're coming to kill me! Kids, get your beards on

2444
01:55:53,926 --> 01:55:55,116
Wh- we don't have any beards!

2445
01:55:55,116 --> 01:55:56,826
I thought I told you to bring beards

2446
01:55:56,826 --> 01:55:57,936
We have an Invisibility Cloak

2447
01:55:57,936 --> 01:55:59,936
Oh well put that on, it's not a beard

2448
01:56:04,856 --> 01:56:06,096
Hey, are you Dumbledore?

2449
01:56:06,096 --> 01:56:08,676
Oh no no no, you see I've got this beard on

2450
01:56:09,996 --> 01:56:10,976
Well have you seen him?

2451
01:56:10,976 --> 01:56:14,136
Oh, I thought I saw someone over there by that bureau

2452
01:56:14,136 --> 01:56:18,716
but I could have just been imagining what it was that I looked like without this beard on

2453
01:56:19,376 --> 01:56:21,936
Alright everybody spread out and look for Dumbledore

2454
01:56:21,936 --> 01:56:24,106
He's gotta be around here somewhere

2455
01:56:26,346 --> 01:56:28,736
Be careful with the Zac Efron poster, it's an antique

2456
01:56:29,546 --> 01:56:31,846
Why do you care so much about Zefron?

2457
01:56:31,846 --> 01:56:33,846
I just appreciate his charms

2458
01:56:34,086 --> 01:56:34,876
and hair

2459
01:56:34,876 --> 01:56:36,086
Harry: Yeah but everybody knows that I like him the best

2460
01:56:36,086 --> 01:56:36,536
Ron: Oh my God shut up

2461
01:56:36,536 --> 01:56:37,686
What the hell was that?
Ron: Oh my God shut up

2462
01:56:39,176 --> 01:56:42,356
I wish that I could say that, it was me

2463
01:56:42,356 --> 01:56:44,596
because I feel that I love Zefron the most

2464
01:56:45,506 --> 01:56:48,026
But it was definitely a voice from within this room

2465
01:56:49,726 --> 01:56:51,266
Is it an invisible man?

2466
01:56:51,436 --> 01:56:53,266
Could the predator be in the room?

2467
01:56:55,886 --> 01:56:58,336
Begin invisible man search!

2468
01:57:01,366 --> 01:57:03,456
Alright, it's me!

2469
01:57:03,456 --> 01:57:05,456
It's Dumbledore

2470
01:57:05,586 --> 01:57:07,656
Dumbledore, where'd you come from?

2471
01:57:07,656 --> 01:57:09,826
The man with the beard turned me in

2472
01:57:10,516 --> 01:57:12,366
Now we've got you right where we want you

2473
01:57:12,366 --> 01:57:15,286
Yes, but what I don't understand is how

2474
01:57:15,566 --> 01:57:18,016
We had the help of a man on the inside

2475
01:57:18,016 --> 01:57:19,636
Someone you trusted

2476
01:57:19,636 --> 01:57:21,636
Someone you may have even loved

2477
01:57:21,876 --> 01:57:22,636
Slughorn?

2478
01:57:22,636 --> 01:57:23,156
Lockheart?

2479
01:57:23,156 --> 01:57:23,836
Aberforth,

2480
01:57:23,836 --> 01:57:24,576
my brother?

2481
01:57:24,576 --> 01:57:25,756
No

2482
01:57:26,136 --> 01:57:27,566
It was me

2483
01:57:28,436 --> 01:57:30,716
Malfoy, you little shit!

2484
01:57:35,426 --> 01:57:36,576
That's right Dumbledore

2485
01:57:36,836 --> 01:57:38,196
I betrayed everyone

2486
01:57:38,496 --> 01:57:39,966
And now I'm going to kill you

2487
01:57:39,966 --> 01:57:41,826
Oh no you're not. Draco,

2488
01:57:41,826 --> 01:57:43,826
If you were gonna kill me you would have done so already

2489
01:57:43,826 --> 01:57:45,236
No! No, no

2490
01:57:45,236 --> 01:57:46,686
Not necessarily true!

2491
01:57:46,766 --> 01:57:49,966
I just wanted to offer you one more game of Connect Four before I offed you

2492
01:57:51,116 --> 01:57:53,226
Draco, there are other options

2493
01:57:53,226 --> 01:57:55,546
You know it is time you looked inside yourself

2494
01:57:55,546 --> 01:57:57,806
and figured out what it is that you really want

2495
01:57:59,006 --> 01:58:00,406
I want Hermione Granger!

2496
01:58:00,406 --> 01:58:01,796
and a rocketship

2497
01:58:03,156 --> 01:58:05,956
Well why didn't you just take the girl out for a Happy Meal?

2498
01:58:05,956 --> 01:58:07,846
Go to space camp, come on

2499
01:58:07,846 --> 01:58:11,006
Murder leads to a life of despair and desperation

2500
01:58:11,606 --> 01:58:13,666
I know you're gonna do the right thing, hey?

2501
01:58:14,076 --> 01:58:15,186
Atta boy

2502
01:58:15,776 --> 01:58:17,696
What the devil is going on here?

2503
01:58:17,696 --> 01:58:18,256
Dumbledore: Severus, thank you
What the devil is going on here?

2504
01:58:18,256 --> 01:58:19,356
Dumbledore: Severus, thank you

2505
01:58:20,576 --> 01:58:22,306
We've got Dumbledore cornered

2506
01:58:22,986 --> 01:58:25,026
Well, what are we waiting for?

2507
01:58:25,266 --> 01:58:27,166
Kill him! Do it, Draco!

2508
01:58:28,586 --> 01:58:29,636
I don't think I can

2509
01:58:29,636 --> 01:58:30,336
Coward!

2510
01:58:30,336 --> 01:58:32,336
Ten points from Gryffindor!

2511
01:58:34,446 --> 01:58:35,706
I don't understand

2512
01:58:35,706 --> 01:58:37,706
I gave you my letterman's jacket

2513
01:58:38,356 --> 01:58:39,676
It never fit

2514
01:58:39,676 --> 01:58:40,826
Oh God!

2515
01:58:40,826 --> 01:58:42,376
Why didn't you tell me?

2516
01:58:42,376 --> 01:58:45,006
I could have shrunk it with magic

2517
01:58:45,176 --> 01:58:48,026
Severus, please don't kill me!

2518
01:58:48,026 --> 01:58:50,396
Avada Kedavra!

2519
01:59:07,916 --> 01:59:08,726
Harry: I hate Snape!

2520
01:59:08,726 --> 01:59:10,536
I hate Snape! I hate Snape. I hate him

2521
01:59:10,536 --> 01:59:11,386
I'm gonna kill him

2522
01:59:11,386 --> 01:59:12,606
Hermione: It's not your fault, Harry

2523
01:59:12,606 --> 01:59:13,886
No it is my fault, don't you get it?

2524
01:59:13,886 --> 01:59:15,546
Everybody's dying because of me

2525
01:59:15,546 --> 01:59:16,936
First Cedric, now Dumbledore

2526
01:59:16,936 --> 01:59:17,896
I can't do it anymore

2527
01:59:17,896 --> 01:59:19,236
Ron: Come on, let's go to The Burrow. Come on!

2528
01:59:19,236 --> 01:59:20,346
No don't you get it?

2529
01:59:20,346 --> 01:59:21,666
I have to do this by myself

2530
01:59:21,666 --> 01:59:22,796
I did it once when I was a baby

2531
01:59:22,796 --> 01:59:25,476
I can't have you guys be near me. You're too much at risk

2532
01:59:25,476 --> 01:59:27,166
Hermione: N-no, we don't care about the risk!

2533
01:59:27,166 --> 01:59:28,616
No you don't understand. You-

2534
01:59:28,616 --> 01:59:30,016
You have to get away from me

2535
01:59:30,016 --> 01:59:31,486
Ron: You can't mean that

2536
01:59:33,326 --> 01:59:34,046
I do!

2537
01:59:34,046 --> 01:59:35,326
Just leave me alone!

2538
01:59:40,357 --> 01:59:43,197
Cornelius Fudge! The Minister of Magic

2539
01:59:44,367 --> 01:59:46,907
I still don't believe you're back

2540
01:59:48,967 --> 01:59:50,417
Believe this Fudge!

2541
01:59:50,417 --> 01:59:52,417
Avada Kedavra!

2542
01:59:54,507 --> 01:59:57,497
A heart attack. Surely!

2543
02:00:06,217 --> 02:00:07,787
Yes! Yes!

2544
02:00:08,577 --> 02:00:11,307
The Ministry has fallen! Yes!

2545
02:00:12,037 --> 02:00:13,247
Now you're the Minister

2546
02:00:13,247 --> 02:00:16,127
Nay, the king of all magic!

2547
02:00:23,027 --> 02:00:24,647
Oh, Voldemort

2548
02:00:25,117 --> 02:00:26,697
Take me right here

2549
02:00:26,697 --> 02:00:28,767
Right now, right here on the Minister's desk

2550
02:00:29,997 --> 02:00:31,387
I'm gonna getcha

2551
02:00:33,007 --> 02:00:34,457
I'm gonna getcha!

2552
02:00:35,227 --> 02:00:36,757
Come here, Trixy!

2553
02:00:43,727 --> 02:00:45,117
Oh, wait

2554
02:00:45,197 --> 02:00:47,327
You wanna try something new?

2555
02:00:47,327 --> 02:00:48,587
Oh, so new!

2556
02:00:49,437 --> 02:00:50,887
Get on the desk

2557
02:00:57,497 --> 02:00:58,907
Now sit up,

2558
02:00:59,247 --> 02:01:00,417
Bitch

2559
02:01:03,167 --> 02:01:05,217
Yes, command me, my Lord

2560
02:01:33,717 --> 02:01:35,437
That's nice

2561
02:01:36,607 --> 02:01:38,937
So what do we do now?

2562
02:01:38,997 --> 02:01:40,937
Anything we want

2563
02:01:41,597 --> 02:01:43,047
Hang out mostly

2564
02:01:44,417 --> 02:01:45,867
We could watch a movie

2565
02:01:46,457 --> 02:01:47,697
How's about "She's All That"?

2566
02:01:47,697 --> 02:01:49,317
I've never seen the beginning of it

2567
02:01:51,557 --> 02:01:53,157
Are you feeling okay, my Lord?

2568
02:01:53,157 --> 02:01:54,877
Of course I am, Quirrell

2569
02:01:55,177 --> 02:01:57,797
Alright, that's the dozenth time you've called me that!

2570
02:01:58,847 --> 02:02:00,617
No, I uh

2571
02:02:00,977 --> 02:02:02,767
I called you a squirrel

2572
02:02:03,617 --> 02:02:05,877
I-I... called you a squirrel

2573
02:02:06,007 --> 02:02:08,817
No. You're thinking on that peon we sent to Azkaban

2574
02:02:08,817 --> 02:02:10,267
He's not a peon

2575
02:02:11,287 --> 02:02:13,337
He's more a man than you'll ever be

2576
02:02:14,827 --> 02:02:15,937
I can't do this

2577
02:02:16,237 --> 02:02:19,557
If I'm going to be evil with all of you, I need to be evil with all of you

2578
02:02:19,837 --> 02:02:21,947
Evil with all of me? Wh-

2579
02:02:22,117 --> 02:02:23,487
What does that mean?

2580
02:02:23,487 --> 02:02:25,187
I know I'm right here

2581
02:02:25,187 --> 02:02:26,167
No

2582
02:02:26,727 --> 02:02:28,557
There are pieces of you missing

2583
02:02:29,597 --> 02:02:31,857
Are you talking about my Horcruxes?

2584
02:02:32,287 --> 02:02:33,327
'Cause- 'cause if it

2585
02:02:33,327 --> 02:02:36,107
If it weren't for those I wouldn't even be here right now!

2586
02:02:48,597 --> 02:02:50,827
I can't remember Dad

2587
02:02:50,827 --> 02:02:53,327
And I can't remember Mom

2588
02:02:53,947 --> 02:02:57,697
Aunts and uncles aren't quite the same

2589
02:02:59,247 --> 02:03:01,877
But I had him

2590
02:03:02,107 --> 02:03:04,667
And life seemed fair

2591
02:03:04,667 --> 02:03:07,227
Yes I had him

2592
02:03:07,647 --> 02:03:11,167
He was there

2593
02:03:11,167 --> 02:03:14,067
To give me strength, show concern

2594
02:03:14,367 --> 02:03:17,027
Ask for nothing in return

2595
02:03:17,287 --> 02:03:20,187
Say hello, talk me though

2596
02:03:20,327 --> 02:03:23,887
Do the things that fathers should do

2597
02:03:26,447 --> 02:03:31,667
And I'm missing you

2598
02:03:32,037 --> 02:03:37,047
I'm just missing you

2599
02:03:39,837 --> 02:03:41,907
There it is. He's gone

2600
02:03:41,907 --> 02:03:44,247
And he's hung me out to dry

2601
02:03:45,057 --> 02:03:47,487
The joy he said he felt, well

2602
02:03:47,657 --> 02:03:50,127
I guess it was a lie

2603
02:03:50,177 --> 02:03:52,687
But when I had him

2604
02:03:52,837 --> 02:03:55,647
My life was fine

2605
02:03:55,647 --> 02:03:58,247
When I had him

2606
02:03:58,247 --> 02:04:01,317
He was mine

2607
02:04:01,317 --> 02:04:04,347
He'd share his thoughts, be a friend

2608
02:04:04,347 --> 02:04:07,307
Stick with me until the end

2609
02:04:07,307 --> 02:04:10,077
Watch a movie, rollerskate

2610
02:04:10,077 --> 02:04:14,667
Fill the world with fear and hate

2611
02:04:15,597 --> 02:04:21,077
And I'm missing you

2612
02:04:21,357 --> 02:04:25,987
I'm just missing you

2613
02:04:29,457 --> 02:04:32,397
Now I'm all alone

2614
02:04:32,397 --> 02:04:35,297
Now you're gone for good

2615
02:04:35,297 --> 02:04:37,577
Now I'm stuck right here

2616
02:04:37,707 --> 02:04:40,327
Wishing I understood

2617
02:04:40,537 --> 02:04:45,147
You gave me hope when my spells weren't right

2618
02:04:46,187 --> 02:04:52,687
You gave me someone to hold every night

2619
02:04:54,997 --> 02:04:57,917
And I'm missing you

2620
02:04:57,917 --> 02:04:58,867
Harry: I'm just missing you
And I'm missing you

2621
02:04:58,867 --> 02:05:00,837
Harry: I'm just missing you

2622
02:05:00,837 --> 02:05:01,447
Quirrell: And I'm missing you
Harry: I'm just missing you

2623
02:05:01,447 --> 02:05:03,607
Quirrell: And I'm missing you

2624
02:05:03,607 --> 02:05:03,987
I'm just missing you
Quirrell: And I'm missing you

2625
02:05:03,987 --> 02:05:11,507
I'm just missing you

2626
02:05:19,867 --> 02:05:22,487
My Dark Lord, news from Severus Snape

2627
02:05:22,617 --> 02:05:26,137
Dumbledore is dead and the dementors have control of the castle

2628
02:05:26,497 --> 02:05:28,887
Hogwarts is yours, my Dark Lord!

2629
02:05:30,607 --> 02:05:32,097
Excellent!

2630
02:05:32,227 --> 02:05:34,257
Prepare my flying machine!

2631
02:05:34,807 --> 02:05:37,367
Looks like I'm going back to Hogwarts!

2632
02:05:42,228 --> 02:05:43,888
Ginny: Harry!

2633
02:05:44,488 --> 02:05:45,908
Ginny, what are you doing here? Get out of here!

2634
02:05:45,908 --> 02:05:48,488
No there's no place to go! The Death Eaters are all over the castle

2635
02:05:48,488 --> 02:05:49,768
I know and they're looking for me

2636
02:05:49,768 --> 02:05:51,288
and if they find me, they're gonna be with me

2637
02:05:51,288 --> 02:05:53,288
Y-you're gonna, you're gonna get in trouble! Get out of here

2638
02:05:53,288 --> 02:05:54,588
Well what are you gonna do?

2639
02:05:55,208 --> 02:05:57,168
I don't know Ginny, I'm not cut out for this kind of thing

2640
02:05:57,168 --> 02:05:59,258
Well no you have to do something. I don't know what you can do

2641
02:05:59,258 --> 02:06:00,278
but you can do it!

2642
02:06:00,278 --> 02:06:01,498
You're Harry Potter

2643
02:06:01,498 --> 02:06:01,838
No!

2644
02:06:01,838 --> 02:06:02,688
You're the Boy Who Lived!

2645
02:06:02,688 --> 02:06:04,268
No Ginny, you don't get it!

2646
02:06:04,858 --> 02:06:06,118
None of you guys get it, I-

2647
02:06:07,438 --> 02:06:08,998
I'm just a twelve year old kid

2648
02:06:14,178 --> 02:06:15,418
Ginny I'm sorry but

2649
02:06:16,248 --> 02:06:17,718
I'm alone

2650
02:06:18,058 --> 02:06:19,958
It's hopeless, right?

2651
02:06:22,038 --> 02:06:25,858
I've been alone

2652
02:06:28,058 --> 02:06:31,638
Surrounded by darkness

2653
02:06:34,338 --> 02:06:38,268
And I've seen how heartless

2654
02:06:39,008 --> 02:06:46,188
The world... can be

2655
02:06:46,978 --> 02:06:50,068
And I've seen you crying

2656
02:06:53,078 --> 02:06:56,598
You felt like it's hopeless

2657
02:06:59,178 --> 02:07:02,558
And I'll always do my best

2658
02:07:03,268 --> 02:07:09,108
To make... you see

2659
02:07:11,068 --> 02:07:14,608
'Cause Harry, you're not alone

2660
02:07:14,838 --> 02:07:17,738
'Cause you're here with me

2661
02:07:18,658 --> 02:07:23,558
And nothing's ever gonna bring us down 'cause nothing can

2662
02:07:23,558 --> 02:07:26,968
Keep me from loving you

2663
02:07:27,058 --> 02:07:30,168
And you know it's true

2664
02:07:30,168 --> 02:07:33,258
It don't matter what'll come to be

2665
02:07:33,408 --> 02:07:38,988
Our love is all we need to make it through

2666
02:07:40,948 --> 02:07:44,318
Now I know it ain't easy

2667
02:07:44,638 --> 02:07:47,238
Harry: Know it ain't easy

2668
02:07:48,558 --> 02:07:50,858
But it ain't hard trying

2669
02:07:50,858 --> 02:07:51,268
Harry: So hard trying
But it ain't hard trying

2670
02:07:51,268 --> 02:07:53,398
Harry: So hard trying

2671
02:07:53,398 --> 02:07:57,218
Everytime I see you smiling

2672
02:07:57,658 --> 02:08:03,548
And I feel you so close to me

2673
02:08:04,018 --> 02:08:05,228
Tell me

2674
02:08:05,418 --> 02:08:08,978
'Cause baby you're not alone

2675
02:08:08,978 --> 02:08:11,988
'Cause you're here with me

2676
02:08:12,778 --> 02:08:17,658
And nothing's ever gonna bring us down 'cause nothing can

2677
02:08:17,658 --> 02:08:20,878
Keep me from loving you

2678
02:08:20,998 --> 02:08:23,948
And you know it's true

2679
02:08:23,948 --> 02:08:27,228
It don't matter what'll come to be

2680
02:08:27,308 --> 02:08:32,468
Our love is all we need to make it through

2681
02:08:37,718 --> 02:08:40,148
Well I still have trouble

2682
02:08:40,508 --> 02:08:43,148
I trip and stumble, trying to

2683
02:08:43,148 --> 02:08:46,798
Make sense of things sometimes

2684
02:08:49,078 --> 02:08:51,908
I look for reasons

2685
02:08:51,908 --> 02:08:53,788
But I don't need them

2686
02:08:53,888 --> 02:09:00,308
All I need is to look in your eyes

2687
02:09:01,158 --> 02:09:06,998
And I realize

2688
02:09:07,128 --> 02:09:08,128
Ron: Hey Harry

2689
02:09:10,598 --> 02:09:13,398
Baby you're not alone

2690
02:09:13,868 --> 02:09:16,568
'Cause you're here with me

2691
02:09:17,698 --> 02:09:20,938
And nothing's ever gonna take us down

2692
02:09:21,178 --> 02:09:26,888
'Cause nothing can keep me from loving you

2693
02:09:26,888 --> 02:09:27,678
Harry: Loving you

2694
02:09:27,678 --> 02:09:28,248
And you know it's true
Harry: Loving you

2695
02:09:28,248 --> 02:09:30,468
And you know it's true

2696
02:09:30,468 --> 02:09:33,688
It don't matter what'll come to be

2697
02:09:33,878 --> 02:09:38,718
Our love is all we need to make it through

2698
02:09:38,908 --> 02:09:40,058
Guys

2699
02:09:40,358 --> 02:09:42,658
I'm so glad you came back. I'm sorry I shouted

2700
02:09:42,658 --> 02:09:46,438
'Cause it don't matter what'll come to be

2701
02:09:46,478 --> 02:09:51,188
Our love is all we need

2702
02:09:51,188 --> 02:09:54,998
Ron: To make it

2703
02:09:54,998 --> 02:09:57,898
To make

2704
02:09:57,968 --> 02:10:00,778
To make

2705
02:10:00,778 --> 02:10:04,748
To make it

2706
02:10:05,128 --> 02:10:11,858
Through

2707
02:10:25,398 --> 02:10:27,378
Alright now that we've got that four part harmony out of the way

2708
02:10:27,378 --> 02:10:28,828
Why don't we go for that Horcrux?

2709
02:10:28,828 --> 02:10:29,388
Yeah let's do it

2710
02:10:29,388 --> 02:10:30,428
Well

2711
02:10:30,428 --> 02:10:31,498
It could be anywhere

2712
02:10:31,838 --> 02:10:34,608
If I had a Horcrux I would drop it in the bottom of the ocean

2713
02:10:34,818 --> 02:10:37,758
Or I would put it in a pyramid with King Tut and all of his jewels

2714
02:10:38,148 --> 02:10:41,998
Or I would blast it into space with a monkey who knew nothing about Horcruxes

2715
02:10:43,178 --> 02:10:47,028
Or it could be hidden somewhere around the mundane British countryside

2716
02:10:47,138 --> 02:10:49,828
Our search could entail months of depressing camping,

2717
02:10:49,828 --> 02:10:52,848
breaking into Gringotts, and drinking boatloads of Polyjuice Potion

2718
02:10:53,828 --> 02:10:57,478
Well the medallion says that dumb, so we're not gonna do that

2719
02:10:57,988 --> 02:11:00,358
But it does say that it's in one convenient place

2720
02:11:00,398 --> 02:11:01,678
Get this, Hogwarts. Wouldn't you know it?

2721
02:11:01,678 --> 02:11:02,548
That's awesome. I love Hogwarts

2722
02:11:02,548 --> 02:11:03,338
Harry: What's even better

2723
02:11:03,338 --> 02:11:04,408
It's in Dumbledore's office!

2724
02:11:04,408 --> 02:11:05,108
Oh, bitchin'

2725
02:11:05,108 --> 02:11:05,708
Hermione: Awesome!
Oh, bitchin'

2726
02:11:07,308 --> 02:11:09,268
So let's go. Oh wait a second, wait a second

2727
02:11:09,268 --> 02:11:10,838
Hold the phone, how did you get here?

2728
02:11:10,838 --> 02:11:12,838
The Death Eaters are all over Hogwarts

2729
02:11:12,838 --> 02:11:13,958
I had help

2730
02:11:13,958 --> 02:11:15,038
From who?

2731
02:11:16,828 --> 02:11:17,808
Oh he's over here

2732
02:11:18,858 --> 02:11:19,808
Malfoy!

2733
02:11:20,288 --> 02:11:23,078
Oh, no, no, no, no. He's really nice now

2734
02:11:23,588 --> 02:11:25,148
Um, I just wanted to say

2735
02:11:25,148 --> 02:11:27,408
that song you guys sang was really beautiful

2736
02:11:29,168 --> 02:11:31,878
And um, while- while I was backstage

2737
02:11:31,878 --> 02:11:34,818
I was, um, working on my harmonizing

2738
02:11:34,968 --> 02:11:38,958
And I thought, um, maybe I could- maybe I could join you but ya-

2739
02:11:38,958 --> 02:11:41,148
Wrapped it up before I could chime in there

2740
02:11:42,878 --> 02:11:46,968
Maybe if you uh, if you do a reprise I could have a little go at it

2741
02:11:47,378 --> 02:11:49,508
So, um, but as- as Ginny said

2742
02:11:49,508 --> 02:11:51,428
I'm really nice now

2743
02:11:51,428 --> 02:11:54,918
And I just feel awful about what happened

2744
02:11:54,918 --> 02:11:56,418
But I mean

2745
02:11:56,498 --> 02:11:58,498
Could you argue that this was my fault?

2746
02:11:58,498 --> 02:11:59,208
Ron: Yes, all-
Harry: Absolutely, you're an asshole all the time

2747
02:11:59,208 --> 02:12:01,058
Hermione: Yes, yes
Harry: Absolutely, you're an asshole all the time

2748
02:12:02,638 --> 02:12:04,808
Yeah, that would be a safe argument

2749
02:12:04,808 --> 02:12:06,308
Uh, but

2750
02:12:06,558 --> 02:12:09,288
Let me ask you one question

2751
02:12:09,588 --> 02:12:12,228
Do you think... I'm happy about this?

2752
02:12:12,228 --> 02:12:13,108
Oh my God Malfoy

2753
02:12:13,108 --> 02:12:14,938
Just because you're upset doesn't mean you're off the hook

2754
02:12:14,938 --> 02:12:15,728
Harry: Yeah, and further more

2755
02:12:15,728 --> 02:12:17,618
Do you want to kick your own ass or should we do it for you?

2756
02:12:17,618 --> 02:12:18,428
Ron: Yeah

2757
02:12:18,518 --> 02:12:19,858
Oh, uh

2758
02:12:19,858 --> 02:12:22,138
Well I guess if you're giving me the option

2759
02:12:22,138 --> 02:12:24,448
I'll... I'll kick my own ass

2760
02:12:25,768 --> 02:12:29,048
But, first I should teach you how to get into Dumbledore's office

2761
02:12:29,048 --> 02:12:31,388
It's ironically the same way the Death Eaters got in

2762
02:12:31,388 --> 02:12:34,928
Okay, alright. Well why don't you boys head off to Dumbledore's office, okay?

2763
02:12:34,928 --> 02:12:37,338
Ginny and I will take the Invisibility Cloak

2764
02:12:37,338 --> 02:12:39,708
And uh, we will see if we can contact the Order of the Phoenix

2765
02:12:39,708 --> 02:12:41,198
We really haven't seen them the whole play

2766
02:12:41,198 --> 02:12:42,388
Harry: Okay, that's a good plan

2767
02:12:42,388 --> 02:12:44,008
Okay, now don't touch me but let's get out of here

2768
02:12:44,008 --> 02:12:45,158
That's good

2769
02:12:46,288 --> 02:12:47,438
Ron: Um, hey, hey Hermione!

2770
02:12:47,438 --> 02:12:48,718
Here come here, come here

2771
02:12:48,718 --> 02:12:49,748
Come downstage

2772
02:12:52,618 --> 02:12:53,498
Uh listen

2773
02:12:55,098 --> 02:12:55,838
Shit

2774
02:12:57,648 --> 02:12:58,978
Um, alright

2775
02:12:58,978 --> 02:13:00,038
Uh, hey

2776
02:13:00,828 --> 02:13:02,038
So...

2777
02:13:05,428 --> 02:13:07,588
I've been acting like a real jerk-ass lately

2778
02:13:08,418 --> 02:13:09,588
You know that

2779
02:13:09,888 --> 02:13:12,488
And uh, and I'm sorry

2780
02:13:13,488 --> 02:13:15,808
It's just, it's just seeing you dance with everyone at the Yule Ball

2781
02:13:15,808 --> 02:13:17,088
just made me kind of jealous

2782
02:13:17,628 --> 02:13:19,078
I was- I was jealous

2783
02:13:19,818 --> 02:13:20,908
You were jealous?

2784
02:13:20,908 --> 02:13:22,268
That's the third time I said I'm jealous

2785
02:13:23,488 --> 02:13:26,388
Uh, well Ron, we don't really have to talk about this right now

2786
02:13:26,388 --> 02:13:27,748
Well what if the Death Eaters get us?

2787
02:13:27,748 --> 02:13:29,218
What if we don't come back, you know?

2788
02:13:29,288 --> 02:13:30,288
Ron, don't say that-

2789
02:13:31,398 --> 02:13:32,608
Whoa

2790
02:13:42,048 --> 02:13:43,098
Oh my God

2791
02:13:52,308 --> 02:13:53,558
Oh, no way

2792
02:13:55,818 --> 02:13:56,698
Take that

2793
02:13:57,508 --> 02:13:58,148
Blueberry

2794
02:13:58,148 --> 02:13:59,188
Yeah I can taste that

2795
02:14:00,698 --> 02:14:01,578
Good. Let it settle

2796
02:14:01,618 --> 02:14:02,488
Yeah, yeah

2797
02:14:08,038 --> 02:14:09,358
It's ungodly

2798
02:14:15,198 --> 02:14:16,558
Take two, take two

2799
02:14:20,118 --> 02:14:20,848
You chew it

2800
02:14:29,158 --> 02:14:29,648
Awesome

2801
02:15:16,458 --> 02:15:18,328
LET'S GO KILL VOLDEMORT!

2802
02:15:40,819 --> 02:15:43,229
You blokes see this Zefron poster?

2803
02:15:43,229 --> 02:15:43,929
Ron: Yeah we know Malfoy

2804
02:15:43,929 --> 02:15:45,239
Harry: We already know about it

2805
02:15:50,519 --> 02:15:52,059
Listen Malfoy, it's not that big of a deal

2806
02:15:52,059 --> 02:15:53,479
Can we just look for some Horcruxes please?

2807
02:15:53,479 --> 02:15:54,139
Ron: Roger

2808
02:15:56,719 --> 02:15:58,109
This thing of pencils a Horcrux?

2809
02:15:58,109 --> 02:15:58,879
No that's not a Horcrux

2810
02:16:00,309 --> 02:16:00,599
Nope

2811
02:16:00,799 --> 02:16:01,779
This has a Horcrux?

2812
02:16:01,779 --> 02:16:02,069
Nope

2813
02:16:04,209 --> 02:16:04,969
Draco: Powdered Donettes?

2814
02:16:04,969 --> 02:16:06,019
Nope. Those are snacks

2815
02:16:06,019 --> 02:16:06,739
Those are snacks

2816
02:16:07,999 --> 02:16:08,659
This a Horcrux?

2817
02:16:08,659 --> 02:16:09,389
Try again

2818
02:16:11,329 --> 02:16:12,349
This could take forever

2819
02:16:12,349 --> 02:16:14,349
He owns so many things in this room

2820
02:16:14,649 --> 02:16:16,159
But the only thing of real value

2821
02:16:17,269 --> 02:16:18,569
That Zefron poster

2822
02:16:19,679 --> 02:16:20,429
Wait a second

2823
02:16:20,849 --> 02:16:21,469
Draco: No

2824
02:16:21,469 --> 02:16:22,369
You don't think...

2825
02:16:22,809 --> 02:16:23,599
No

2826
02:16:25,439 --> 02:16:28,479
Anything related to Zac Efron would never be anything evil

2827
02:16:28,509 --> 02:16:30,149
Ron: That's impossible. No way

2828
02:16:41,250 --> 02:16:42,590
Ron! Kill it!

2829
02:16:42,791 --> 02:16:44,041
Kill it, it's the last Horcrux

2830
02:16:44,041 --> 02:16:44,340
Kill it Ron!

2831
02:16:44,340 --> 02:16:44,770
Draco: Don't kill it!
Kill it Ron!

2832
02:16:44,770 --> 02:16:45,169
Draco: Don't kill it!

2833
02:16:45,169 --> 02:16:45,985
It's Zefron!

2834
02:16:46,000 --> 02:16:47,669
No he's so charismatic!

2835
02:16:47,669 --> 02:16:49,669
Don't kill me!

2836
02:16:49,916 --> 02:16:52,000
I'm not your enemy

2837
02:16:53,020 --> 02:16:54,833
Potter is the enemy

2838
02:16:55,121 --> 02:16:56,708
No no no Harry is my friend

2839
02:16:56,810 --> 02:16:59,911
You gotta get your head in the game, Weasley!

2840
02:17:01,541 --> 02:17:03,125
He will betray you

2841
02:17:03,125 --> 02:17:05,640
He will take that which you want the most

2842
02:17:05,640 --> 02:17:07,750
It's a lie, Ron! Don't listen to it, he's lying

2843
02:17:07,750 --> 02:17:10,520
I know your thoughts Ronald Weasley

2844
02:17:10,840 --> 02:17:13,666
I know what you truly desire

2845
02:17:14,235 --> 02:17:15,850
Hermione: Hello Ron

2846
02:17:15,850 --> 02:17:17,960
Oh my God Hermione, you've lost weight

2847
02:17:17,960 --> 02:17:21,500
That's right. I'm in shape for Harry Potter

2848
02:17:21,916 --> 02:17:23,291
Wait, what- Harry?

2849
02:17:23,291 --> 02:17:24,223
That's right!

2850
02:17:24,223 --> 02:17:28,666
As long as Harry's around you'll always be second best, least loved

2851
02:17:28,666 --> 02:17:32,916
But if Harry Potter were gone, then we could be together forever

2852
02:17:32,916 --> 02:17:34,676
Ron! It's not true. It's not true, Ron

2853
02:17:34,676 --> 02:17:35,916
Yeah Harry's my friend

2854
02:17:35,916 --> 02:17:37,750
But don't you want me Ron?

2855
02:17:37,750 --> 02:17:38,385
Yes

2856
02:17:38,385 --> 02:17:39,750
Don't you love me Ron?

2857
02:17:39,750 --> 02:17:40,385
Ron: Yes!
Don't you love me Ron?

2858
02:17:40,385 --> 02:17:40,515
Then you know what you gotta do, Ron!
Ron: Yes!

2859
02:17:40,515 --> 02:17:42,708
Then you know what you gotta do, Ron!

2860
02:17:42,708 --> 02:17:43,443
Yes

2861
02:17:44,303 --> 02:17:45,791
I must kill Harry

2862
02:17:46,791 --> 02:17:48,125
That's right Weasley!

2863
02:17:48,125 --> 02:17:49,625
Harry: Ron! No!
That's right Weasley!

2864
02:17:49,625 --> 02:17:49,833
It's a trick, Ron. Don't listen to her!
That's right Weasley!

2865
02:17:49,833 --> 02:17:51,333
It's a trick, Ron. Don't listen to her!

2866
02:17:51,878 --> 02:17:52,708
Stop it!

2867
02:17:52,708 --> 02:17:55,041
Listen, Hermione's my best- two of my best friends!

2868
02:17:55,041 --> 02:17:56,460
I would never do anything to hurt you or her!

2869
02:17:56,460 --> 02:18:00,382
Lies Weasley! All lies. You will cower in hell!

2870
02:18:00,382 --> 02:18:02,170
Ron it's not true! You're my best friend, man. My best friend!

2871
02:18:02,170 --> 02:18:03,333
Kill him!
Ron it's not true! You're my best friend, man. My best friend!

2872
02:18:03,333 --> 02:18:03,344
Ron it's not true! You're my best friend, man. My best friend!

2873
02:18:03,583 --> 02:18:05,478
Kill him!

2874
02:18:18,333 --> 02:18:19,094
Do it again

2875
02:18:30,798 --> 02:18:34,054
Oh just- put some tape on this, it's fine

2876
02:18:38,693 --> 02:18:39,875
Ron

2877
02:18:39,875 --> 02:18:41,625
You had me going there for a minute, buddy

2878
02:18:41,625 --> 02:18:42,304
Oh yeah

2879
02:18:43,054 --> 02:18:45,000
Sorry about that, pal. It was just...

2880
02:18:45,382 --> 02:18:48,554
Everything she was saying, you know, and it feels like I couldn't

2881
02:18:49,636 --> 02:18:50,728
I dunno...

2882
02:18:50,728 --> 02:18:51,594
What?

2883
02:18:53,791 --> 02:18:55,500
Even if that's

2884
02:18:55,886 --> 02:18:58,333
how she did feel about you and me

2885
02:18:59,000 --> 02:19:00,916
Well, it wouldn't matter

2886
02:19:03,166 --> 02:19:04,416
'Cause you're my best friend

2887
02:19:08,125 --> 02:19:12,083
I would never... do anything to hurt you

2888
02:19:14,728 --> 02:19:16,666
Because I love you

2889
02:19:17,541 --> 02:19:18,886
I love you too, man

2890
02:19:18,886 --> 02:19:19,420
Come on

2891
02:19:20,757 --> 02:19:21,886
I love you man, that's so great...

2892
02:19:21,886 --> 02:19:22,291
My best friend-
I love you man, that's so great...

2893
02:19:22,291 --> 02:19:23,291
My best friend-

2894
02:19:23,500 --> 02:19:24,386
No touching, no, no

2895
02:19:29,304 --> 02:19:32,170
Well um, listen chaps

2896
02:19:32,416 --> 02:19:35,882
As fun as this was, I thought destroying a Horcrux would be much harder

2897
02:19:35,882 --> 02:19:36,333
Yeah

2898
02:19:36,333 --> 02:19:36,916
Me too

2899
02:19:36,916 --> 02:19:38,426
'Cause when you think about it

2900
02:19:38,632 --> 02:19:40,460
Horcruxes are just kind of stupid

2901
02:19:40,460 --> 02:19:41,166
Yeah look at that

2902
02:19:42,460 --> 02:19:43,548
Whoa, whoa, whoa!

2903
02:19:44,170 --> 02:19:46,458
Bellatrix: Wands down boys!

2904
02:19:47,166 --> 02:19:49,920
How did you idiots get captured? You were invisible

2905
02:19:49,920 --> 02:19:51,000
Hermione: Sorry!

2906
02:19:51,000 --> 02:19:53,000
Do it Potter! Or they die!

2907
02:19:53,208 --> 02:19:56,916
Well, looks like we've got our backs up against the wall with nowhere to go

2908
02:19:57,426 --> 02:19:59,125
Put you swords down, and wands

2909
02:19:59,765 --> 02:20:04,333
Aww, look at itty bitty Harry Potter giving orders to his itty bitty diaper friends!

2910
02:20:04,333 --> 02:20:06,443
I'm not a baby! I'm not a baby, I'm twelve and I killed a Horcrux

2911
02:20:06,443 --> 02:20:07,136
Snape: What the devil is going on here?
I'm not a baby! I'm not a baby, I'm twelve and I killed a Horcrux

2912
02:20:07,136 --> 02:20:09,791
Snape: What the devil is going on here?

2913
02:20:10,804 --> 02:20:12,875
Whoa, dj vu, I'm so...

2914
02:20:13,166 --> 02:20:14,090
Bellatrix: Victory Snape!

2915
02:20:15,041 --> 02:20:17,750
I love it! We have Potter and his friends at last!

2916
02:20:17,750 --> 02:20:19,333
You are a very mean person!

2917
02:20:19,333 --> 02:20:20,583
Yeah and Dumbledore trusted you

2918
02:20:20,583 --> 02:20:22,170
Yeah you're a big fat traitor Snape

2919
02:20:22,170 --> 02:20:24,515
Oh a traitor am I, Potter?

2920
02:20:24,728 --> 02:20:26,333
You're exactly right

2921
02:20:26,515 --> 02:20:28,333
I am a traitor

2922
02:20:28,333 --> 02:20:31,340
Because I'm about to betray someone

2923
02:20:31,340 --> 02:20:33,791
Right now

2924
02:20:33,791 --> 02:20:34,636
Hiya!

2925
02:20:38,478 --> 02:20:39,693
Bat-Bogey Hex!

2926
02:20:39,693 --> 02:20:40,291
No!

2927
02:20:43,757 --> 02:20:44,636
Expelliarmus!

2928
02:20:47,257 --> 02:20:49,920
Serpensortia!

2929
02:20:54,382 --> 02:20:59,216
My wiener!

2930
02:21:01,478 --> 02:21:02,710
Snape! No, Snape!

2931
02:21:02,710 --> 02:21:06,094
Don't even think about moving unless any one of you wants a snake to the wiener!

2932
02:21:07,291 --> 02:21:09,166
Now come on Potter, you're coming with me

2933
02:21:09,166 --> 02:21:12,882
Only the Dark Lord has reserved the right to kill you. Come on!

2934
02:21:12,882 --> 02:21:13,666
Kids!

2935
02:21:13,666 --> 02:21:14,554
Mom!?

2936
02:21:14,554 --> 02:21:15,500
Mrs. Weasley?

2937
02:21:15,500 --> 02:21:16,443
Who the hell are you?

2938
02:21:16,478 --> 02:21:19,765
I'm Molly Weasley and those are my kids

2939
02:21:21,750 --> 02:21:23,791
Avada Kedavra!

2940
02:21:24,166 --> 02:21:25,291
That is not fair!

2941
02:21:25,291 --> 02:21:26,875
Die! Bitch

2942
02:21:34,250 --> 02:21:35,583
Holy shit!

2943
02:21:35,920 --> 02:21:37,125
Mom you just killed her!

2944
02:21:37,125 --> 02:21:39,750
I thought you were going to tuck in her shirt or make her do the dishes!

2945
02:21:43,466 --> 02:21:43,920
Stupid!

2946
02:21:43,920 --> 02:21:45,750
Ow! Ow! Ow

2947
02:21:45,750 --> 02:21:48,426
Deperate time calls for deperate measures

2948
02:21:48,426 --> 02:21:52,416
Even the Unforgivable can be considered forgivable sometimes.

2949
02:21:54,228 --> 02:21:55,458
What are you doing here?

2950
02:21:55,458 --> 02:21:57,375
We came here with the Order of the Phoenix

2951
02:21:57,375 --> 02:22:01,375
Lupin, Tonks, Mad-Eye Moody, Sirius Black, and your brother Fred

2952
02:22:01,375 --> 02:22:02,443
Oh great, where are they?

2953
02:22:02,443 --> 02:22:03,590
They're all dead

2954
02:22:05,382 --> 02:22:07,090
Fred... no!

2955
02:22:07,943 --> 02:22:08,791
Anyway...

2956
02:22:08,791 --> 02:22:12,344
Just came here to save your lives, go back to what you were doing

2957
02:22:12,344 --> 02:22:13,833
Disapparate!

2958
02:22:24,111 --> 02:22:25,486
Snape! Snape, Snape

2959
02:22:25,486 --> 02:22:27,208
Um, uh... Expelliarmus!

2960
02:22:27,208 --> 02:22:28,630
Die! Die!

2961
02:22:28,630 --> 02:22:31,904
No... Harry this does not look good. That is a coral snake

2962
02:22:31,904 --> 02:22:33,653
And a coral snake is a highly poisonous snake

2963
02:22:33,653 --> 02:22:34,329
Snape: Potter, she's right
And a coral snake is a highly poisonous snake

2964
02:22:34,329 --> 02:22:35,076
Snape: Potter, she's right

2965
02:22:35,076 --> 02:22:38,079
It's too late for me now

2966
02:22:38,079 --> 02:22:41,154
Before I go, I need to tell you

2967
02:22:41,380 --> 02:22:44,069
There is another Horcrux

2968
02:22:44,660 --> 02:22:46,538
How can that be? All six have been destroyed

2969
02:22:46,538 --> 02:22:48,417
No, no there's a seventh

2970
02:22:48,417 --> 02:22:51,038
I really hope it's not an Ashley Tisdale poster. I can't do that

2971
02:22:51,611 --> 02:22:53,910
Take the medallion

2972
02:22:55,038 --> 02:22:55,997
Doesn't say anything

2973
02:22:55,997 --> 02:22:57,997
But give it to Granger

2974
02:22:59,579 --> 02:23:03,028
Wait but... it says there's one right here but I don't understand

2975
02:23:03,028 --> 02:23:03,701
Yeah

2976
02:23:04,167 --> 02:23:07,403
Harry, the night Voldemort killed your parents

2977
02:23:07,535 --> 02:23:12,153
He tried to destroy you but his body was destroyed instead

2978
02:23:12,153 --> 02:23:17,417
When that happened, a part of his soul was blasted away from the whole

2979
02:23:17,869 --> 02:23:20,201
And attached itself...

2980
02:23:22,194 --> 02:23:23,497
to you

2981
02:23:25,119 --> 02:23:29,701
Voldemort can never truly die until all the Horcruxes have been destroyed

2982
02:23:29,701 --> 02:23:34,236
But if... if Harry's a Horcrux, I mean, does Harry have to be destroyed?

2983
02:23:34,236 --> 02:23:35,458
There's got to be another way

2984
02:23:35,458 --> 02:23:39,038
No, Potter. I'll show you what you need to do

2985
02:23:39,208 --> 02:23:42,319
Watch very carefully

2986
02:23:49,667 --> 02:23:51,528
He... he didn't even do anything

2987
02:23:52,861 --> 02:23:54,861
That's cause he's dead you dumb mother-

2988
02:24:04,701 --> 02:24:06,403
People of Hogwarts

2989
02:24:07,361 --> 02:24:10,243
My Death Eaters have taken the castle

2990
02:24:10,614 --> 02:24:15,038
And your headmaster, Albus Dumbledore... he's dead

2991
02:24:16,028 --> 02:24:22,035
Continue to resist, and you will all be killed one by one

2992
02:24:22,319 --> 02:24:27,569
But... there need not be war between us

2993
02:24:27,701 --> 02:24:30,451
You all fought so valiantly

2994
02:24:30,451 --> 02:24:34,614
And I'm willing to offer you positions in my new world order

2995
02:24:34,614 --> 02:24:35,826
as my slaves

2996
02:24:37,630 --> 02:24:40,111
Give up now and be forgiven

2997
02:24:40,747 --> 02:24:43,201
I command my Death Eaters to stand down

2998
02:24:44,236 --> 02:24:48,497
Now, Harry Potter. I speak directly to you

2999
02:24:49,614 --> 02:24:55,944
You do not wish for those closest to you to continue to suffer and die on your behalf

3000
02:24:56,285 --> 02:24:58,667
You will come face me yourself

3001
02:24:59,119 --> 02:25:04,114
I will be waiting for you in the Forbidden Forest for one hour

3002
02:25:04,917 --> 02:25:10,288
At the end of that hour you have not come to face me, have not- turned yourself in...

3003
02:25:10,785 --> 02:25:12,785
The battle recommences

3004
02:25:13,111 --> 02:25:17,486
This time, Potter, I shall enter the frame myself

3005
02:25:18,154 --> 02:25:19,861
And I will find you

3006
02:25:20,153 --> 02:25:26,701
And I will murder every last man, women, and child

3007
02:25:27,154 --> 02:25:30,361
Who has tried to conceal you from me

3008
02:25:31,410 --> 02:25:33,819
Voldemort out, bitches

3009
02:25:36,493 --> 02:25:38,917
Alright guys don't worry. We- we still have an hour

3010
02:25:38,917 --> 02:25:40,917
Okay? We just need to come up with a plan

3011
02:25:40,917 --> 02:25:44,069
No, there's- there's no plan Hermione. I know what I have to do. I-

3012
02:25:44,630 --> 02:25:45,576
I have to die

3013
02:25:45,576 --> 02:25:48,069
No no no no there's got to be another way

3014
02:25:48,069 --> 02:25:50,326
Well, m-maybe there's something, uh

3015
02:25:50,326 --> 02:25:51,778
Maybe there's something in this book

3016
02:25:51,778 --> 02:25:55,486
You know we- we could find some sort of enchantment that will nullify-

3017
02:25:55,486 --> 02:25:57,611
No, no forget about it. There-

3018
02:25:57,611 --> 02:25:59,079
There's only one thing to do

3019
02:26:01,130 --> 02:26:02,380
I have to die

3020
02:26:03,819 --> 02:26:05,035
I love you all

3021
02:26:05,736 --> 02:26:07,993
Except you Draco, I can't *** stand you

3022
02:26:12,486 --> 02:26:13,660
Goodbye

3023
02:26:13,660 --> 02:26:14,069
Ginny: Harry...

3024
02:26:14,069 --> 02:26:15,278
Ron: Harry!
Ginny: Harry...

3025
02:26:45,951 --> 02:26:48,208
He's not coming, my Lord

3026
02:26:49,319 --> 02:26:51,111
It seems that way

3027
02:26:57,404 --> 02:26:59,247
Well Death Eaters

3028
02:26:59,247 --> 02:27:02,130
Looks like we're going back to seize the castle

3029
02:27:02,528 --> 02:27:05,153
This is what Potter has chosen

3030
02:27:07,708 --> 02:27:10,986
It's funny I... I expected him to

3031
02:27:11,278 --> 02:27:12,903
I expected him to come

3032
02:27:13,778 --> 02:27:15,778
It seems I was mistaken

3033
02:27:16,736 --> 02:27:17,667
Harry: You weren't!

3034
02:27:22,079 --> 02:27:24,038
Harry Potter!

3035
02:27:24,493 --> 02:27:26,864
The Boy Who Lived

3036
02:27:29,236 --> 02:27:30,630
Crucio!

3037
02:27:33,038 --> 02:27:34,660
Ow...

3038
02:27:34,986 --> 02:27:36,660
Crucio!

3039
02:27:42,153 --> 02:27:44,194
You're not even going to fight back

3040
02:27:54,201 --> 02:27:55,785
You're weak

3041
02:27:58,236 --> 02:27:59,903
Weak

3042
02:28:00,944 --> 02:28:04,993
Just like your...

3043
02:28:05,778 --> 02:28:07,528
Parents

3044
02:28:12,364 --> 02:28:14,538
They did not deserve to live in this world

3045
02:28:14,538 --> 02:28:16,708
In my world!

3046
02:28:19,535 --> 02:28:20,997
Prepare to join them

3047
02:28:22,069 --> 02:28:23,788
Prepare

3048
02:28:23,788 --> 02:28:25,369
To die

3049
02:28:25,917 --> 02:28:28,028
Avada Kedavra!

3050
02:28:36,958 --> 02:28:38,944
Voldy! Voldy!

3051
02:28:39,319 --> 02:28:41,369
You've done it my Lord. Potter is dead!

3052
02:28:41,369 --> 02:28:43,364
No one shall ever question your powers again!

3053
02:28:43,778 --> 02:28:44,944
Yes

3054
02:28:46,319 --> 02:28:48,114
Doesn't this please you my Lord?

3055
02:28:55,038 --> 02:28:56,038
Yeah

3056
02:28:58,285 --> 02:29:00,451
Yeah it's great, it's great

3057
02:29:02,201 --> 02:29:05,417
I just thought it might make me feel less empty inside

3058
02:29:07,404 --> 02:29:09,028
Well Death Eaters

3059
02:29:10,079 --> 02:29:13,861
We go back to Hogwarts to tell them of what has become of their

3060
02:29:15,329 --> 02:29:16,458
Hero

3061
02:29:21,625 --> 02:29:22,519
Dumbledore: Hey Harry

3062
02:29:22,620 --> 02:29:23,512
Harry: Whoa!

3063
02:29:24,302 --> 02:29:26,004
Dumbledore, wha-?

3064
02:29:26,495 --> 02:29:27,954
What are you doing here? What am- where am I?

3065
02:29:27,954 --> 02:29:29,673
I thought I was dead. I got shot by Voldemort

3066
02:29:29,673 --> 02:29:33,463
Let's just say you're somewhere between our world and the next

3067
02:29:33,579 --> 02:29:35,708
What? Did I survive? What... what happened?

3068
02:29:35,708 --> 02:29:37,923
Wouldn't be the first time, Potter

3069
02:29:37,923 --> 02:29:39,329
Take a seat

3070
02:29:40,458 --> 02:29:41,579
Alright

3071
02:29:42,620 --> 02:29:43,620
Harry

3072
02:29:44,120 --> 02:29:45,838
Have you ever heard of a lo- Sit down!

3073
02:29:45,838 --> 02:29:47,838
Have you ever heard of a love shield?

3074
02:29:48,287 --> 02:29:51,192
Uh... no but it sounds kind of

3075
02:29:51,192 --> 02:29:52,120
Kind of fruity

3076
02:29:52,120 --> 02:29:54,762
A love shield is anything but fruity

3077
02:29:55,192 --> 02:29:59,662
It's when somebody loves you so much that if they were ever willing to give their live for you

3078
02:29:59,662 --> 02:30:03,418
That love literally becomes a shield that surrounds your body

3079
02:30:03,418 --> 02:30:05,673
To protect you from any form of Dark Magic

3080
02:30:06,454 --> 02:30:08,423
So is that what just happened to me?

3081
02:30:08,423 --> 02:30:09,341
I have a love shield?

3082
02:30:09,341 --> 02:30:13,418
Harry, it's time for you to learn all the things you should have known seven years ago

3083
02:30:13,418 --> 02:30:15,829
Which really would have helped you along the way

3084
02:30:17,463 --> 02:30:19,787
The love shield protected you the first time, uh

3085
02:30:19,787 --> 02:30:22,302
Voldemort accidentally turned you into the seventh Horcrux

3086
02:30:22,302 --> 02:30:24,302
The one that not even he knew about. Uh...

3087
02:30:24,418 --> 02:30:26,829
Exactly, and when Voldemort tried killing you this time

3088
02:30:26,829 --> 02:30:30,225
He was actually unknowingly killing the piece of himself inside of you

3089
02:30:30,225 --> 02:30:32,225
Uh, and I've known the whole time

3090
02:30:34,004 --> 02:30:35,879
You knew this whole time? You bastard

3091
02:30:35,879 --> 02:30:36,245
Hey, hey
You knew this whole time? You bastard

3092
02:30:36,245 --> 02:30:37,173
Hey, hey

3093
02:30:37,418 --> 02:30:39,954
They don't call me the greatest wizard who ever lived for nothing

3094
02:30:41,620 --> 02:30:45,383
Harry, it is time for you to get your cute little butt back there

3095
02:30:45,383 --> 02:30:47,725
and fight him as a mortal man

3096
02:30:47,725 --> 02:30:51,162
Except this time, he will be a mortal man too

3097
02:30:51,162 --> 02:30:53,546
Dumbledore, I get what you're saying. I know what I have to do

3098
02:30:53,546 --> 02:30:54,762
Good boy, good boy

3099
02:30:54,762 --> 02:30:57,662
Hey, before I go... um

3100
02:30:57,662 --> 02:30:58,963
So you're clairvoyant now, right?

3101
02:30:58,963 --> 02:31:00,302
 You can see the past, the present, and the future all the same time?

3102
02:31:00,302 --> 02:31:01,162
Oh yeah
 You can see the past, the present, and the future all the same time?

3103
02:31:02,302 --> 02:31:04,418
Can you tell me how <i>Lost</i> ends?

3104
02:31:09,245 --> 02:31:13,495
Harry, there are some questions that even I can't answer

3105
02:31:16,463 --> 02:31:17,287
Thanks man

3106
02:31:17,287 --> 02:31:19,591
Hey, no problem. Get out of here

3107
02:31:20,995 --> 02:31:22,708
Third door on your left, yeah

3108
02:31:25,379 --> 02:31:27,208
Are you ready to go Dumbledore?

3109
02:31:27,208 --> 02:31:29,704
Sure am, Rumbleroar!

3110
02:31:32,879 --> 02:31:37,133
And you're sure you don't want to let Harry Potter know that you're really still alive?

3111
02:31:37,133 --> 02:31:38,802
Ahh no

3112
02:31:38,802 --> 02:31:41,620
Pigfarts has been a closely guarded secret for thousands of years

3113
02:31:41,620 --> 02:31:43,633
It'd be a shame to let the cat out of the bag

3114
02:31:43,633 --> 02:31:44,870
No pun intended

3115
02:31:44,870 --> 02:31:46,745
I supposed you're right

3116
02:31:47,173 --> 02:31:49,412
Do you have your spacesuit, Dumbledore?

3117
02:31:49,412 --> 02:31:51,412
Oh! Thank you for reminding me!

3118
02:31:59,052 --> 02:32:00,412
Ready to go, Rumby?

3119
02:32:00,412 --> 02:32:01,870
I sure am

3120
02:32:01,870 --> 02:32:03,370
To Pigfarts!

3121
02:32:03,370 --> 02:32:06,942
Rumbleroar!

3122
02:32:21,588 --> 02:32:23,662
People of Hogwarts

3123
02:32:24,338 --> 02:32:25,704
It's me

3124
02:32:26,588 --> 02:32:29,591
Harry Potter... is dead

3125
02:32:30,213 --> 02:32:35,162
He was killed while running away, trying to save himself

3126
02:32:35,668 --> 02:32:40,192
While you laid down your lives for him

3127
02:32:41,046 --> 02:32:43,329
The battle is won!

3128
02:32:43,829 --> 02:32:45,963
My Death Eaters outnumber you

3129
02:32:46,713 --> 02:32:50,762
You continue to resist and be slaughtered

3130
02:32:52,412 --> 02:32:53,975
Come out of the castle!

3131
02:32:54,370 --> 02:32:59,133
Kneel before me, and you may be spared

3132
02:33:02,620 --> 02:33:03,463
Ah shit

3133
02:33:03,463 --> 02:33:04,918
Okay, um...

3134
02:33:05,552 --> 02:33:08,495
Alright, uh you guys. You guys barricade the door

3135
02:33:08,495 --> 02:33:11,370
Go with, with the bench. Go, go. Do it. Do it right now

3136
02:33:12,012 --> 02:33:13,454
Um, Cho!

3137
02:33:13,454 --> 02:33:16,162
You- you see if Neville's dead

3138
02:33:17,463 --> 02:33:20,829
Um, you guys! Uh, go get snacks!

3139
02:33:21,341 --> 02:33:22,620
Ah shit we barricaded the door

3140
02:33:24,338 --> 02:33:26,037
Me... I will... will- quick

3141
02:33:28,162 --> 02:33:30,173
Well, there's only one thing we need to do. We're gonna fight

3142
02:33:30,173 --> 02:33:33,458
Ugh, come on I'm tired

3143
02:33:33,458 --> 02:33:35,796
Can't we just be Death Eaters?

3144
02:33:36,923 --> 02:33:40,162
No! No we can't just be Death Eaters

3145
02:33:40,579 --> 02:33:41,838
Okay?

3146
02:33:46,923 --> 02:33:49,370
We are gonna fight! Okay?

3147
02:33:49,620 --> 02:33:52,412
And we are gonna fight so hard!

3148
02:33:53,329 --> 02:33:55,004
That we are gonna win

3149
02:33:57,754 --> 02:33:59,912
He thinks that we're finished

3150
02:34:00,588 --> 02:34:02,633
He thinks that we're done

3151
02:34:03,168 --> 02:34:05,879
He thinks that it's over

3152
02:34:05,879 --> 02:34:07,495
His battle is won

3153
02:34:07,495 --> 02:34:08,692
Ha!

3154
02:34:08,692 --> 02:34:10,692
He thinks that we're finished

3155
02:34:10,841 --> 02:34:13,379
No, but we're aren't through

3156
02:34:13,379 --> 02:34:18,442
Stop and think, my friends. What would Harry do for you?

3157
02:34:18,442 --> 02:34:20,546
Never gave up the fight

3158
02:34:20,546 --> 02:34:22,975
Harry stood up for what is right

3159
02:34:22,975 --> 02:34:27,454
Well now it's our turn

3160
02:34:27,454 --> 02:34:31,963
Our turn!

3161
02:34:31,963 --> 02:34:35,338
Make a joyful sound

3162
02:34:35,338 --> 02:34:37,725
Voldemort is going down!

3163
02:34:37,725 --> 02:34:38,745
Yah!

3164
02:34:38,745 --> 02:34:39,213
Come on!

3165
02:34:39,213 --> 02:34:39,912
Come on guys!

3166
02:34:39,912 --> 02:34:41,079
Get in a line!

3167
02:34:42,383 --> 02:34:45,475
We must unite so we can fight

3168
02:34:46,225 --> 02:34:48,745
Turn the battle around!

3169
02:34:48,745 --> 02:34:52,620
Time's running out. It's time to shout

3170
02:34:52,620 --> 02:34:55,091
Voldemort is going down!

3171
02:34:55,442 --> 02:34:58,704
Can't you feel a fire burning?

3172
02:34:58,704 --> 02:35:01,995
Now it's time to be a man

3173
02:35:01,995 --> 02:35:09,120
A great big, muscley, super big, super hot man!

3174
02:35:09,120 --> 02:35:12,037
We won't be pushed around anymore

3175
02:35:12,037 --> 02:35:15,254
We'll be a force you cannot ignore

3176
02:35:15,254 --> 02:35:19,796
We'll be an army for Dumbledore

3177
02:35:19,796 --> 02:35:24,129
For Dumbledore!

3178
02:35:24,129 --> 02:35:27,213
We must unite so we can fight

3179
02:35:28,133 --> 02:35:30,512
Turn the battle around!

3180
02:35:30,512 --> 02:35:34,537
Time's running out. It's time to shout

3181
02:35:34,537 --> 02:35:36,942
Voldemort is going down!

3182
02:35:37,787 --> 02:35:39,046
Guys I'm alive!

3183
02:35:40,254 --> 02:35:40,912
Ron: You're back!

3184
02:35:40,912 --> 02:35:42,370
Guys, I know how to defeat Voldemort

3185
02:35:42,370 --> 02:35:43,754
Everybody follow me, okay?

3186
02:35:43,754 --> 02:35:44,912
We're gonna beat him

3187
02:35:44,912 --> 02:35:47,379
We must unite so we can

3188
02:35:47,379 --> 02:35:48,841
FIGHT!

3189
02:35:48,841 --> 02:35:51,133
Turn the battle around!

3190
02:35:51,133 --> 02:35:55,208
Time's running out. It's time to shout!

3191
02:35:55,208 --> 02:35:56,829
Voldemort is going...

3192
02:35:56,829 --> 02:36:00,012
We must unite, so we can fight
Voldemort is going...

3193
02:36:00,012 --> 02:36:02,879
Voldemort is going down!

3194
02:36:11,421 --> 02:36:13,581
Cho! No, no no no it's cool. We barricaded it

3195
02:36:13,581 --> 02:36:16,209
It's alright. He can't get in. We barricaded the two doors and it's fine

3196
02:36:16,209 --> 02:36:18,209
It's impossible. It's impossible. Don't worry about it-

3197
02:36:20,592 --> 02:36:22,304
Avada Kedavra!

3198
02:36:23,342 --> 02:36:25,235
What!?

3199
02:36:25,235 --> 02:36:26,789
Potter!?

3200
02:36:26,789 --> 02:36:29,054
How many times do I have to kill you, boy?

3201
02:36:29,054 --> 02:36:30,296
Clearly more than once

3202
02:36:30,674 --> 02:36:33,164
But it's all over Voldemort, 'cause you can't kill me this time

3203
02:36:33,424 --> 02:36:35,706
Nobody help me. I gotta do this by myself

3204
02:36:35,706 --> 02:36:37,164
He doesn't mean that!

3205
02:36:37,372 --> 02:36:39,804
It's not how he operates, is it boy?

3206
02:36:40,039 --> 02:36:43,081
Who you gonna use as a human shield this time, Potter?

3207
02:36:43,081 --> 02:36:43,171
Harry: Don't-

3208
02:36:43,171 --> 02:36:43,581
Hermione: Ron!
Harry: Don't-

3209
02:36:43,581 --> 02:36:44,622
Ron: Oh

3210
02:36:47,122 --> 02:36:49,629
Nobody! Because this time it's just you and me

3211
02:36:49,629 --> 02:36:52,081
Because all the Horcruxes are gone. I destroyed them all

3212
02:36:52,081 --> 02:36:52,592
What?

3213
02:36:53,247 --> 02:36:55,081
Even my Zefron poster!?

3214
02:36:55,921 --> 02:36:57,088
Especially the Zefron poster!

3215
02:36:57,088 --> 02:36:59,747
No! Curse you, Potter! You'll die for that!

3216
02:36:59,747 --> 02:37:01,235
No! I won't, I won't

3217
02:37:01,235 --> 02:37:03,546
Because you can't kill me, and you can't kill any of these people

3218
02:37:03,546 --> 02:37:04,883
What the **** you on about?

3219
02:37:06,750 --> 02:37:08,554
You don't learn from your mistakes, do you Voldemort?

3220
02:37:08,554 --> 02:37:10,664
I was prepared to die to save these people

3221
02:37:10,664 --> 02:37:11,289
But you didn't!

3222
02:37:11,289 --> 02:37:12,581
Yes, but I meant to

3223
02:37:13,956 --> 02:37:15,235
And that's what did it

3224
02:37:15,235 --> 02:37:17,592
I've done what my mother did for me for these people

3225
02:37:17,592 --> 02:37:19,921
I've given them magical sanctuary so you can't hurt me

3226
02:37:19,921 --> 02:37:21,289
Or these people ever again!

3227
02:37:21,289 --> 02:37:22,214
So what?

3228
02:37:23,629 --> 02:37:25,664
Who cares about these children?

3229
02:37:25,664 --> 02:37:27,714
It's you I want dead, Potter

3230
02:37:27,714 --> 02:37:30,464
What's to stop you from dying when I strike?

3231
02:37:30,464 --> 02:37:31,581
Just one thing

3232
02:37:32,133 --> 02:37:33,755
Think about all the people you've hurt, Voldemort

3233
02:37:33,755 --> 02:37:35,092
All the lives you've destroyed

3234
02:37:35,092 --> 02:37:37,122
All the people you've killed

3235
02:37:37,497 --> 02:37:38,054
Okay?

3236
02:37:38,054 --> 02:37:39,921
Maybe try a little slice of remorse pie

3237
02:37:39,921 --> 02:37:40,674
What?

3238
02:37:40,956 --> 02:37:44,709
There's got to be one person... one thing in your life that you miss

3239
02:37:44,709 --> 02:37:46,005
You regret

3240
02:37:48,581 --> 02:37:51,206
Well, maybe there's one I...

3241
02:37:52,331 --> 02:37:54,081
No! There isn't!

3242
02:37:54,539 --> 02:37:55,997
The joke's on you, Potter!

3243
02:37:55,997 --> 02:37:57,789
I don't care about anybody!

3244
02:37:57,789 --> 02:37:58,706
I know

3245
02:37:58,872 --> 02:38:00,706
And that's what makes you such a piece of shit

3246
02:38:01,789 --> 02:38:03,622
'Cause here at Hogwarts we all stick together

3247
02:38:03,921 --> 02:38:05,622
We love one another. We're friends

3248
02:38:06,174 --> 02:38:07,750
My love's protected these guys

3249
02:38:07,750 --> 02:38:12,206
And their love is all I need to protect me from you

3250
02:38:12,206 --> 02:38:15,209
Let's put that theory to the test, Potter

3251
02:38:15,209 --> 02:38:16,255
Avada Kedavra!

3252
02:38:16,255 --> 02:38:17,129
Harry: Expelliarmus!

3253
02:38:26,714 --> 02:38:29,914
Cho: Well chocolate frogs! Harry Potter did it, y'all!

3254
02:38:40,735 --> 02:38:43,289
Whoa! Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa!

3255
02:38:43,289 --> 02:38:46,622
Whoa, whoa whoa whoa

3256
02:38:47,664 --> 02:38:48,546
Listen, Harry

3257
02:38:48,546 --> 02:38:49,164
What?

3258
02:38:49,622 --> 02:38:51,985
Just wanna let you guys know, um

3259
02:38:52,763 --> 02:38:54,372
That I'm totally cool with it. Go on

3260
02:38:54,372 --> 02:38:56,372
Go, make out with him. Come on. Make out with me

3261
02:38:59,924 --> 02:39:02,497
Guys, I mean, I guess that about ties up all the loose ends!

3262
02:39:02,497 --> 02:39:03,164
Yeah! Everything's cool!

3263
02:39:03,164 --> 02:39:05,164
Oh! Except for the House Cup Tournament

3264
02:39:05,164 --> 02:39:06,789
Neville: Kids! Kids, look at this

3265
02:39:06,789 --> 02:39:07,671
I found Dumbledore's will

3266
02:39:07,671 --> 02:39:08,664
Harry: Dumbledore's will?

3267
02:39:08,664 --> 02:39:11,414
It says in the event of my death, Gryffindor wins the House Cup!

3268
02:39:12,789 --> 02:39:15,383
It also says that Hogwarts goes to Harry Potter

3269
02:39:15,581 --> 02:39:17,383
My chocolate factory goes to Charlie

3270
02:39:17,383 --> 02:39:19,383
And Toontown goes to the Toons!

3271
02:39:21,997 --> 02:39:24,763
Hey guys, well I guess all the professors are dead, so

3272
02:39:24,763 --> 02:39:26,296
Butterbeer's on me!

3273
02:39:37,289 --> 02:39:38,581
Free to go

3274
02:39:40,456 --> 02:39:41,414
Quirrell: Thank you

3275
02:39:42,709 --> 02:39:43,997
Dementor: You know

3276
02:39:43,997 --> 02:39:47,959
While I was devouring every single one of your happy thoughts

3277
02:39:47,959 --> 02:39:50,622
They all seem to be about a certain friend of yours

3278
02:39:51,000 --> 02:39:52,622
Care to talk?

3279
02:39:54,789 --> 02:39:56,914
No, no that's behind me now

3280
02:39:57,714 --> 02:39:58,956
Sorry

3281
02:39:59,263 --> 02:40:00,592
Well did you hear the news?

3282
02:40:00,959 --> 02:40:02,914
Voldemort is dead!

3283
02:40:03,804 --> 02:40:06,671
Yeah, good luck getting off this impenetrable island

3284
02:40:13,505 --> 02:40:14,581
Dead!?

3285
02:40:50,342 --> 02:40:51,554
Hey you

3286
02:40:58,372 --> 02:41:00,622
Voldemort is it... is it really you?

3287
02:41:02,464 --> 02:41:03,914
What's left of me

3288
02:41:05,304 --> 02:41:06,500
But I just heard that you were-

3289
02:41:06,500 --> 02:41:07,755
Destroyed

3290
02:41:10,842 --> 02:41:11,592
Yeah

3291
02:41:19,629 --> 02:41:21,539
But Quirrell there's

3292
02:41:21,539 --> 02:41:25,342
There's part of me... that's still here

3293
02:41:25,414 --> 02:41:28,838
And I can't go on to the next plane without it

3294
02:41:30,250 --> 02:41:32,706
It's a part of me that can't be destroyed

3295
02:41:33,209 --> 02:41:34,714
Because it's right

3296
02:41:35,763 --> 02:41:36,674
in...

3297
02:41:38,763 --> 02:41:39,709
Here

3298
02:41:45,081 --> 02:41:46,289
In my heart?

3299
02:41:51,174 --> 02:41:52,622
So you came back?

3300
02:41:55,209 --> 02:41:56,714
I came home

3301
02:42:07,581 --> 02:42:10,581
And you don't want to kill Harry Potter anymore?

3302
02:42:12,789 --> 02:42:13,956
No...

3303
02:42:16,372 --> 02:42:17,513
No

3304
02:42:18,747 --> 02:42:22,164
Because I learned something when I had my body back, Quirrell

3305
02:42:23,129 --> 02:42:25,414
I learned that life is

3306
02:42:25,831 --> 02:42:26,956
really messy

3307
02:42:27,174 --> 02:42:29,005
...complicated and

3308
02:42:29,706 --> 02:42:32,622
And it doesn't turn out the way that you think it will

3309
02:42:33,081 --> 02:42:35,831
And that- you-

3310
02:42:36,039 --> 02:42:39,513
You think killing people might make them like you but it doesn't

3311
02:42:40,956 --> 02:42:43,421
It just makes people dead

3312
02:42:49,164 --> 02:42:52,092
I got ki- I got killed by a two year old!

3313
02:42:53,164 --> 02:42:55,464
And it's really embarrassing, and everyone says

3314
02:42:55,464 --> 02:42:57,804
"When you gonna come back Voldemort?"

3315
02:42:58,129 --> 02:42:59,838
"When you gonna take over the world?"

3316
02:42:59,838 --> 02:43:02,588
And it's on me! It's all on me!

3317
02:43:03,214 --> 02:43:07,331
And I'm sitting there by myself 'cause no one wants to help

3318
02:43:08,789 --> 02:43:11,750
And I say to myself

3319
02:43:15,235 --> 02:43:18,013
Maybe with Quirrell things would be okay

3320
02:43:20,592 --> 02:43:22,633
Is okay good?

3321
02:43:26,421 --> 02:43:28,005
Quirrell

3322
02:43:30,054 --> 02:43:32,379
Okay is wonderful

3323
02:43:43,633 --> 02:43:46,921
Baby you're not alone

3324
02:43:46,921 --> 02:43:49,671
'Cause you're here with me

3325
02:43:50,872 --> 02:43:55,338
And nothing's ever gonna bring us down 'cause nothing can

3326
02:43:55,338 --> 02:43:58,554
Keep me from loving you

3327
02:43:58,956 --> 02:44:01,706
And you know it's true

3328
02:44:01,956 --> 02:44:05,122
It don't matter what'll come to be

3329
02:44:05,338 --> 02:44:10,206
Our love is all we need to make it through
