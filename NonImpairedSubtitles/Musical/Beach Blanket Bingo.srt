00:00:28,966 --> 00:00:30,297
Bingo.

00:00:41,278 --> 00:00:42,540
G-48.

3
00:00:42,646 --> 00:00:44,011
Bingo!

4
00:01:10,574 --> 00:01:11,973
Bingo.

5
00:01:36,734 --> 00:01:40,033
- Man, Bonehead's really swinging!
- I do believe.

6
00:01:43,874 --> 00:01:47,435
Well, if it's all that good,
let's give it a chance.

7
00:01:50,047 --> 00:01:51,947
I don't think that's it.

8
00:01:53,751 --> 00:01:56,948
<i>A shot in the mouth?
That's exactly what Dennis Frank...</i>

00:02:01,392 --> 00:02:05,795
<i>Do you have a headache?
The answer is Witch Doctor's Aspirin.</i>

<i>Beach blanket bingo.</i>

12
00:02:17,207 --> 00:02:19,539
<i>That's the name of the game</i>

13
00:02:20,077 --> 00:02:22,739
<i>Take a blanket made for two, now</i>

14
00:02:22,813 --> 00:02:24,804
<i>Add a boy and a girl</i>

15
00:02:25,783 --> 00:02:28,445
<i>That's a game for
me and you, now</i>

16
00:02:28,652 --> 00:02:30,984
<i>Yeah, let's give it a whirl</i>

<i>That's the name of the game</i>

21
00:02:43,067 --> 00:02:45,831
<i>- Every lad and...
- Every lassie</i>

22
00:02:45,936 --> 00:02:48,063
<i>Playing down by the shore</i>

23
00:02:48,739 --> 00:02:51,572
<i>- Looking smart
- And looking classy</i>

24
00:02:51,642 --> 00:02:54,236
<i>Yeah, they're learning the score</i>

<i>That's the name of the game</i>

30
00:03:17,334 --> 00:03:20,132
<i>When a lad just meets a lassie</i>

31
00:03:20,204 --> 00:03:22,263
<i>And he asks for a kiss</i>

32
00:03:23,140 --> 00:03:25,938
<i>Then he finds the lassie sassy</i>

33
00:03:26,009 --> 00:03:28,273
<i>- Right blanket!

<i>Bingo!</i>

00:04:44,288 --> 00:04:45,619
Hey, look!

50
00:04:48,559 --> 00:04:51,392
"Hear Sugar Kane's... "

51
00:04:51,461 --> 00:04:53,520
We can read, Goo Goo.

52
00:05:02,906 --> 00:05:04,806
Hey, look at that!

53
00:05:06,076 --> 00:05:08,237
Remember, as close
to the boat as you can.

54
00:05:08,312 --> 00:05:10,371
I'll land in the captain's lap.

55
00:05:10,447 --> 00:05:12,915
- You do, and I'll...
- Bye-bye!

56
00:05:15,552 --> 00:05:17,543
- It's a girl.
- It figures.

57
00:05:17,621 --> 00:05:20,317
Somebody must have
left the door open.

58
00:05:28,999 --> 00:05:31,263
That's what I call a high dive.

59
00:05:36,240 --> 00:05:38,299
Hey, it's a free fall!

60
00:05:39,843 --> 00:05:42,937
- Hey, look at that! That's great, huh?
- That's wild.

61
00:05:46,450 --> 00:05:49,578
Boy, that's out of sight!
It's too much. Wow!

62
00:06:03,000 --> 00:06:05,867
- Do you think that's a publicity stunt?
- Well, sure it is.

63
00:06:05,969 --> 00:06:07,698
Man, that's sure some stunt.

64
00:06:07,804 --> 00:06:10,136
Well, what if she's in trouble?
We should help her.

65
00:06:10,207 --> 00:06:13,267
Oh, look, don't panic.
You see that rich boy's canoe out there?

66
00:06:13,343 --> 00:06:16,369
He'll pick her up. Boy, are you gullible!

67
00:06:20,450 --> 00:06:22,611
See, what'd I tell you?

68
00:06:23,954 --> 00:06:26,582
Dee Dee, a smart promoter
could sell you Grant's tomb.

69
00:06:26,690 --> 00:06:29,989
Oh, no. I've got sense enough
not to buy that again.

70
00:06:41,271 --> 00:06:42,863
Gosh, I wish I could do that.

71
00:06:42,940 --> 00:06:46,876
You just did, kiddo.
Now get out there and take the bows.

72
00:06:47,511 --> 00:06:49,172
Gee, I'm a little scared.

73
00:06:49,246 --> 00:06:51,441
Look, somebody paid a lot
of money for this stunt.

74
00:06:51,548 --> 00:06:53,277
Don't louse it up now.

75
00:06:53,383 --> 00:06:56,750
- Well, isn't it kind of cold?
- Only on the top.

76
00:07:01,224 --> 00:07:04,216
They didn't pick her up.
What's the matter with those guys?

77
00:07:04,294 --> 00:07:05,693
I don't know. Let's go find out.

78
00:07:05,762 --> 00:07:09,858
Hold it. If they passed her up,
I have a feeling we should, too.

79
00:07:09,933 --> 00:07:11,423
Come on, Bonehead.

80
00:07:11,535 --> 00:07:13,935
Come on, you guys, let's go!

81
00:07:16,373 --> 00:07:19,399
- Come on, you guys!
- Let's get her!

82
00:07:46,436 --> 00:07:49,337
Perfect.
Earl, take a look at this.

83
00:07:54,845 --> 00:07:56,779
And now it's our move.

84
00:07:58,815 --> 00:08:02,012
All right, men. This is one of my big ones.
Oh, hi, girls.

85
00:08:02,119 --> 00:08:05,145
I can see the headlines now.
"Singer saved by surfer. "

86
00:08:05,255 --> 00:08:07,849
Perfect.
There's a pearl for you, Earl.

87
00:08:07,958 --> 00:08:09,186
Yeah, I wish I'd said that.

88
00:08:09,292 --> 00:08:12,955
Oh, you will. It's all yours.
Anything for the column.

89
00:08:15,632 --> 00:08:17,031
Sugar's out there.

90
00:08:17,134 --> 00:08:20,001
- Hey, what's going on?
- You'll see.

91
00:08:23,006 --> 00:08:24,803
Put your arm around her, boy.

92
00:08:24,875 --> 00:08:28,436
- Hey, what is this?
- Don't be a problem. Perfect.

93
00:08:28,512 --> 00:08:31,606
Hey, look, if I put my arm
around someone, I like it to be my idea.

94
00:08:31,681 --> 00:08:32,773
You're a hero, boy.

95
00:08:32,849 --> 00:08:35,443
You just saved a beautiful young girl
from the jaws of the deep.

96
00:08:35,519 --> 00:08:37,111
Got that, Earl? "Jaws of the deep. "

97
00:08:37,187 --> 00:08:40,350
Yeah, I'm gonna keep
that one for my wallet.

98
00:08:41,324 --> 00:08:45,317
- I have a feeling she didn't need saving.
- Yeah, but Frankie might.

99
00:08:46,129 --> 00:08:50,532
You kids know who this is?
It's Earl Wilson, the famous columnist.

100
00:08:50,634 --> 00:08:53,501
- Who's she? The BW?
- What's a BW?

101
00:08:53,570 --> 00:08:55,902
Well, in Earl's column,
it always means his beautiful wife,

102
00:08:56,006 --> 00:08:57,371
only this one isn't.

103
00:08:57,474 --> 00:09:01,205
- Beautiful, yes, but wife, no.
- Haven't you ever heard of Earl Wilson?

104
00:09:01,311 --> 00:09:05,680
Oh, you'll have to excuse Bonehead.
He hasn't even heard of President Wilson.

105
00:09:05,749 --> 00:09:09,480
Well, Mr. Wilson has come all the
way out from New York

106
00:09:09,553 --> 00:09:11,885
just for this one interview, right, Earl?

107
00:09:11,988 --> 00:09:14,684
- You might say that.
- I just did.

108
00:09:14,758 --> 00:09:16,385
Is she somebody or something?

109
00:09:16,493 --> 00:09:19,860
"Is she somebody?"
Where you been living, in a cave?

110
00:09:19,930 --> 00:09:21,022
You're close.

111
00:09:21,098 --> 00:09:24,329
Come along, now,
and let's get out of these loose clothes

112
00:09:24,401 --> 00:09:26,926
and slip into something tight.

113
00:09:28,038 --> 00:09:29,733
I'd like to see her slip
out of something tight

114
00:09:29,840 --> 00:09:33,367
and into something more comfortable,
like my arms.

115
00:09:33,610 --> 00:09:36,204
Just think of me as your father.

116
00:09:41,618 --> 00:09:43,848
Now I think we're ready.

117
00:09:45,522 --> 00:09:47,752
Now, that's what I call a healthy girl.

118
00:09:47,858 --> 00:09:50,383
Sugar Kane doing
her first free fall...

119
00:09:50,460 --> 00:09:54,760
in honor of her album of sky songs,
Come Fall With Me.

120
00:10:03,206 --> 00:10:04,730
What's up, boss?

121
00:10:04,808 --> 00:10:07,368
Shut up. I'm thinking.

122
00:10:07,444 --> 00:10:09,207
How long will that take?

123
00:10:09,279 --> 00:10:11,304
Until I get it thunk.

124
00:10:18,788 --> 00:10:22,952
Perfect. Oh, we need our
little hero in a picture.

125
00:10:25,162 --> 00:10:26,891
I can make it on my own.

126
00:10:32,502 --> 00:10:36,268
- I didn't catch your name, boy.
- I didn't throw it.

127
00:10:36,339 --> 00:10:38,500
That's pretty tacky, boy.

128
00:10:38,608 --> 00:10:41,338
I didn't want us to have
a language barrier.

129
00:10:41,444 --> 00:10:44,777
That's enough pictures.
Don't want to tire her.

130
00:10:44,948 --> 00:10:47,815
Let's dig this groovy chick.
Come on.

131
00:10:50,020 --> 00:10:51,851
How far did you fall
before your chute opened?

132
00:10:51,955 --> 00:10:54,515
- How does it feel, falling?
- Hey, where'd you learn the free-fall bit?

133
00:10:54,624 --> 00:10:57,354
At Big Drop's Skydiving Club.
It's just over the hill.

134
00:10:57,460 --> 00:11:01,362
- How do you know when to pull the cord?
- Before you hit the ground, Goo Goo.

135
00:11:01,464 --> 00:11:03,955
Yes. Well, it's sort of hard to explain.

136
00:11:04,434 --> 00:11:06,834
You see, when you're
falling, it's like...

137
00:11:06,937 --> 00:11:09,997
Well, I get the feeling
I'm somebody else all the time.

138
00:11:10,106 --> 00:11:12,040
I think we'll be more comfortable
up at the beach house.

139
00:11:12,142 --> 00:11:15,202
And I'll get Sugar to sing for you.
Excuse me.

140
00:11:15,645 --> 00:11:18,614
Little Sugar's too excited
to talk right now, fellas,

141
00:11:18,682 --> 00:11:20,115
and Earl's waiting to interview her.

142
00:11:20,183 --> 00:11:22,117
But I'll tell you what.
Keep in touch.

143
00:11:22,185 --> 00:11:25,621
Here, have my card.
Take one. They're free.

144
00:11:27,190 --> 00:11:29,385
Now, that's pretty tacky.

145
00:11:30,527 --> 00:11:31,960
Oh, a smartnik.

146
00:11:32,028 --> 00:11:34,189
But tomorrow, boy,
look for your picture in the paper.

147
00:11:34,297 --> 00:11:35,321
Come along, sweet.

148
00:11:35,398 --> 00:11:38,128
Sugar lives right up the beach.
You're all invited anytime.

149
00:11:38,201 --> 00:11:40,999
Come on up and hear
her latest album.

150
00:11:41,304 --> 00:11:43,704
- Bye.
- Frankie.

151
00:11:43,807 --> 00:11:46,537
- Bye, Frankie.
- All right. Come on, dear.

152
00:11:46,643 --> 00:11:48,304
"Bye, Frankie. "

153
00:11:48,378 --> 00:11:50,005
Looks like Frankie's done it again.

154
00:11:50,080 --> 00:11:52,310
Yeah, and he struck
a real gusher this time.

155
00:11:57,721 --> 00:11:59,348
You stupids!

156
00:11:59,723 --> 00:12:01,315
I'm through thinking.

157
00:12:01,391 --> 00:12:02,858
Now, what I'm thinking is,

158
00:12:02,926 --> 00:12:06,259
that poor little Sugar Kane
is mixed up with undesirables.

159
00:12:06,429 --> 00:12:08,863
Well, Eric Von Zipper's gonna protect her.

160
00:12:08,932 --> 00:12:11,765
I think I adore her. She's nifty.

161
00:12:11,868 --> 00:12:15,827
- That skydiving looks like fun.
- Like to try it, boss?

162
00:12:19,209 --> 00:12:20,540
Eric Von...

163
00:12:20,610 --> 00:12:23,101
Eric Von Zipper thinks
cycles is better.

164
00:12:23,213 --> 00:12:25,010
- Right?
- Right.

165
00:12:25,081 --> 00:12:26,605
We go!

166
00:12:35,091 --> 00:12:37,855
Eric Von Zipper ain't gonna
get left behind this time.

167
00:12:37,927 --> 00:12:40,555
Jerome, you... Me...

168
00:13:48,531 --> 00:13:50,123
It's a wiggy beach.

169
00:13:55,472 --> 00:13:57,099
Okay, ready?

170
00:13:57,674 --> 00:14:00,871
<i>It only hurts when I cry</i>

171
00:14:01,678 --> 00:14:04,112
<i>It only hurts when I cry</i>

172
00:14:04,180 --> 00:14:05,511
<i>Go, Donna!</i>

173
00:14:05,715 --> 00:14:09,776
<i>You ask me if
I ever long for him</i>

174
00:14:09,853 --> 00:14:13,721
<i>Since we said goodbye</i>

175
00:14:13,823 --> 00:14:17,782
<i>Sure, I get sad
But it's not too bad</i>

176
00:14:17,861 --> 00:14:21,854
<i>It only hurts when I cry</i>

177
00:14:21,965 --> 00:14:25,799
<i>You see,
I hardly even think of him</i>

178
00:14:25,869 --> 00:14:29,896
<i>As time goes slowly by</i>

179
00:14:30,006 --> 00:14:33,840
<i>I just go on like
there's nothing wrong</i>

180
00:14:33,910 --> 00:14:38,006
<i>It only hurts when I cry</i>

181
00:14:38,081 --> 00:14:41,915
<i>Sure, I remember our first kiss</i>

182
00:14:42,018 --> 00:14:45,886
<i>The way I loved him then</i>

183
00:14:45,989 --> 00:14:49,891
<i>Sometimes I think a love like this</i>

184
00:14:49,993 --> 00:14:53,929
<i>Could never happen again</i>

185
00:14:54,030 --> 00:14:58,160
<i>So please don't worry
if I sigh for him</i>

186
00:14:58,234 --> 00:15:01,897
<i>You know that I'll get by</i>

187
00:15:02,005 --> 00:15:05,873
<i>I'll just pretend that
it's not the end</i>

188
00:15:05,942 --> 00:15:10,106
<i>It only hurts when I cry</i>

189
00:15:10,213 --> 00:15:13,876
<i>It only hurts when I cry</i>

190
00:15:13,950 --> 00:15:18,216
<i>It only hurts when I cry.</i>

191
00:15:18,288 --> 00:15:22,247
<i>It only hurts when I cry</i>

192
00:15:22,358 --> 00:15:26,260
<i>It only hurts when I cry</i>

193
00:15:26,362 --> 00:15:30,264
<i>Sure, I remember our first kiss</i>

194
00:15:30,366 --> 00:15:33,961
<i>The way I loved him then</i>

195
00:15:34,070 --> 00:15:38,268
<i>Sometimes I think a love like this</i>

196
00:15:38,374 --> 00:15:42,367
<i>Could never happen again</i>

197
00:15:42,445 --> 00:15:46,541
<i>So please don't worry
if I sigh for him</i>

198
00:15:46,616 --> 00:15:50,609
<i>You know that I'll get by</i>

199
00:15:50,720 --> 00:15:54,588
<i>I'll just pretend that
it's not the end</i>

200
00:15:54,657 --> 00:15:58,650
<i>It only hurts when I cry</i>

201
00:15:58,761 --> 00:16:02,663
<i>It only hurts when I cry</i>

202
00:16:02,765 --> 00:16:06,826
<i>It only hurts when I cry</i>

203
00:16:06,936 --> 00:16:12,897
<i>It only hurts when I cry</i>

204
00:16:23,686 --> 00:16:25,779
- Dee Dee, I've been thinking.
- About what?

205
00:16:25,855 --> 00:16:28,881
- About Sugar.
- Oh, really?

206
00:16:28,992 --> 00:16:30,619
No, I mean about skydiving.

207
00:16:30,693 --> 00:16:33,457
Boy, it'd be a new thrill up there.
Just imagine that feeling.

208
00:16:33,530 --> 00:16:36,556
Yeah, like a bird.
When do we start?

209
00:16:37,233 --> 00:16:38,325
We?

210
00:16:38,401 --> 00:16:40,905
Well, sure. It'll be
a new thrill up there.

211
00:16:40,906 --> 00:16:42,701
Yeah, for me,
but not for you.

212
00:16:42,805 --> 00:16:45,000
A girl's job is in the kitchen,

213
00:16:45,074 --> 00:16:47,406
at least until she learns
how to cook a hot dog.

214
00:16:47,510 --> 00:16:48,738
Dinner was burnt.

215
00:16:48,845 --> 00:16:51,211
Women have a few rights,
in case you haven't heard.

216
00:16:51,314 --> 00:16:52,406
We can even vote.

217
00:16:52,515 --> 00:16:55,643
- Yeah, that's the real American tragedy.
- Very funny.

218
00:16:55,718 --> 00:16:57,379
Okay, play your little game.

219
00:16:57,487 --> 00:17:01,480
But when the time comes,
I do the jumping and you do the watching.

220
00:17:03,359 --> 00:17:06,590
Come on, let's turn in.
We'll want to get an early start.

221
00:17:15,772 --> 00:17:17,535
- Hi, Butch.
- Hi.

222
00:17:22,011 --> 00:17:23,376
Bingo!

223
00:17:42,432 --> 00:17:43,763
Well!

224
00:17:45,702 --> 00:17:48,796
Mark Anthony and Cleopatra
have returned.

225
00:17:48,905 --> 00:17:51,897
You know something, Bonehead?
You remind me of the ocean.

226
00:17:51,975 --> 00:17:55,570
- You mean I'm so deep?
- No. You make me sick.

227
00:17:57,780 --> 00:17:59,577
I think I'm sorry I asked.

228
00:17:59,649 --> 00:18:01,048
Hey, fellas, what do you say...

229
00:18:01,117 --> 00:18:03,415
we hit Big Drop's tomorrow
and make the skydiving scene, huh?

230
00:18:03,486 --> 00:18:05,215
Yeah, that's a good scene.

231
00:18:05,288 --> 00:18:08,587
- How about you, Bonehead?
- I ain't gonna jump out of no airplane.

232
00:18:08,658 --> 00:18:13,061
- I may be dumb, but I'm not...
- Bonehead, don't put it to a vote.

233
00:18:14,097 --> 00:18:16,395
I'm going with Frankie tomorrow
to try the skydiving bit.

234
00:18:16,466 --> 00:18:18,957
- Any of you girls with me?
- Sure!

235
00:18:19,068 --> 00:18:20,763
Hey, you girls are crazy.

236
00:18:20,837 --> 00:18:24,295
- Why? You fellas are gonna do it.
- Yeah, but boys are different.

237
00:18:24,407 --> 00:18:26,898
I've noticed, and I'm glad.

238
00:18:26,976 --> 00:18:28,443
Now, that's my kind of people.

239
00:18:28,511 --> 00:18:32,174
You girls are so anxious to jump,
why don't you jump down here?

240
00:18:32,281 --> 00:18:34,647
I'll guarantee you a happy landing.

241
00:18:34,751 --> 00:18:38,152
I'd rather jump out of an airplane
without a parachute.

242
00:18:38,254 --> 00:18:40,688
Either way you get to heaven.

243
00:18:46,462 --> 00:18:48,191
Hey, that's a good-looking kid.

244
00:18:48,831 --> 00:18:52,028
- Yeah, she's not bad.
- I wasn't talking about her.

245
00:18:52,135 --> 00:18:54,501
See? You're crazy about him.

246
00:18:54,604 --> 00:18:57,129
One look at a picture in the paper
and you're nuts about the guy.

247
00:18:57,206 --> 00:18:58,935
Oh, come off it, will you?

248
00:18:59,275 --> 00:19:01,675
Hi, kids. Welcome to Big Drop's,

249
00:19:01,778 --> 00:19:03,803
where everything is sky-high
but the prices.

250
00:19:03,880 --> 00:19:05,677
- Hi. What's up?
- Hi.

251
00:19:05,782 --> 00:19:07,943
- I'm Big Drop.
- Big Drop?

252
00:19:08,017 --> 00:19:09,143
It's just a nickname.

253
00:19:09,218 --> 00:19:12,381
They used to call me Big Droop,
but I had it shortened.

254
00:19:18,695 --> 00:19:21,027
Seems to me
I've seen him somewhere before.

255
00:19:21,130 --> 00:19:23,530
That's Buster, my helper,
and Bobbi, his helper.

256
00:19:23,633 --> 00:19:25,498
Looks like she could use a helper, too.

257
00:19:25,568 --> 00:19:28,401
It's just good, clean fun.
Keeps him out of pool halls.

258
00:19:28,504 --> 00:19:30,870
Come on in and look around.

259
00:19:36,345 --> 00:19:37,676
Look around you, gang.

260
00:19:37,747 --> 00:19:41,012
It isn't much,
but we like to think of it as our home.

261
00:19:41,084 --> 00:19:44,076
This is Bonnie and Steve.
They help me run the place.

262
00:19:44,187 --> 00:19:45,347
- Hi.
- Hi, gang.

263
00:19:45,421 --> 00:19:46,513
Hello, there.

264
00:19:46,589 --> 00:19:49,353
These kids want to learn
all about skydiving.

265
00:19:49,425 --> 00:19:50,824
Free fall and everything.

266
00:19:50,893 --> 00:19:55,262
Of course, free fall isn't really free,
but it's cheaper than expensive.

267
00:19:55,364 --> 00:19:58,527
I assume you children
want to learn all about skydiving?

268
00:19:58,601 --> 00:20:01,570
- This child does.
- This child's from Wig City.

269
00:20:01,671 --> 00:20:03,002
I buy that.

270
00:20:03,072 --> 00:20:06,200
All right, I'll leave you kids
with Bonnie and Steve.

271
00:20:06,275 --> 00:20:09,176
If you brought money,
I'll see you in the office.

272
00:20:12,448 --> 00:20:15,781
I saw your picture in the paper
this morning.

273
00:20:15,885 --> 00:20:17,546
It didn't really flatter you.

274
00:20:17,620 --> 00:20:21,613
- It was my bad side. I was facing front.
- That's cute.

275
00:20:22,759 --> 00:20:24,556
We really do want
to learn skydiving.

276
00:20:24,627 --> 00:20:27,357
She has some crazy idea
she wants to try it.

277
00:20:27,430 --> 00:20:30,422
Why not? Bonnie's made over 100 dives,
and she's still in one piece.

278
00:20:30,533 --> 00:20:31,761
You can say that again.

279
00:20:31,868 --> 00:20:36,362
Why not? Bonnie's made over 100 dives,
and she's still in one piece.

280
00:20:36,539 --> 00:20:39,406
- I mean, I'm sorry.
- You don't have to apologize.

281
00:20:39,475 --> 00:20:40,874
He does to me.

282
00:20:40,943 --> 00:20:44,743
Best way to learn is to watch.
Bonnie and I'll show you a double free fall.

283
00:20:44,814 --> 00:20:48,147
Well, maybe first you ought to explain
some of the dangers involved.

284
00:20:48,251 --> 00:20:51,243
The only dangerous part
is driving to the airport.

285
00:20:51,320 --> 00:20:54,778
- Come on, I'll show you.
- Let's go, guys.

286
00:20:56,058 --> 00:20:59,789
- And you can show me.
- My pleasure.

287
00:21:06,102 --> 00:21:09,663
- Hey, ladies first.
- Go.

288
00:21:16,345 --> 00:21:18,006
There she goes!

289
00:21:50,046 --> 00:21:51,980
Oh, look at that!

290
00:21:52,048 --> 00:21:53,845
It's beautiful! I can't wait.

291
00:21:53,950 --> 00:21:56,214
Look, Dee Dee, Bonnie is an expert.

292
00:21:56,319 --> 00:21:57,980
I learn fast.

293
00:22:00,823 --> 00:22:02,484
Look at that!

294
00:23:44,226 --> 00:23:46,285
Hey, there's Bonehead.

295
00:23:52,234 --> 00:23:53,667
Perfect.

296
00:24:02,745 --> 00:24:05,236
- What happened?
- Well, he was surfing, and...

297
00:24:05,314 --> 00:24:06,804
She saved him, that's what happened.

298
00:24:06,916 --> 00:24:09,111
This poor boy was out there
floundering helpless,

299
00:24:09,185 --> 00:24:10,812
and Sugar swam out
and pulled him in.

300
00:24:10,920 --> 00:24:12,820
- She's a heroine.
- Bullets, I...

301
00:24:12,922 --> 00:24:15,117
Sugar, don't be modest.
We all know what you've done.

302
00:24:15,191 --> 00:24:17,489
Just rest your head
back on Sugar's lap, boy.

303
00:24:17,593 --> 00:24:18,753
Sure.

304
00:24:18,828 --> 00:24:22,286
All right, everybody watching?
Sugar, cry a little.

305
00:24:31,173 --> 00:24:35,269
Perfect. I've done it again.
Tell me your name, boy.

306
00:24:35,344 --> 00:24:37,710
Well, everybody calls me Bonehead.

307
00:24:37,813 --> 00:24:41,146
- Oh. Well, what do your friends call you?
- Stupid.

308
00:24:41,217 --> 00:24:42,650
This calls for a celebration.

309
00:24:42,718 --> 00:24:45,312
Tomorrow night, supper at Sugar's.
How about it, kids?

310
00:24:45,388 --> 00:24:49,188
- Separate checks?
- Aren't you getting shorter?

311
00:24:49,358 --> 00:24:52,350
Don't be late, kids.
Come along, Sugar.

312
00:24:53,729 --> 00:24:55,890
Up, boy. We got the picture.

313
00:24:59,201 --> 00:25:02,364
You know something?
I just don't know.

314
00:25:02,471 --> 00:25:04,905
You know something?
With your luck, you don't have to.

315
00:25:05,007 --> 00:25:06,338
Well said.

316
00:25:13,716 --> 00:25:16,241
You tired? Chalk.

317
00:25:21,390 --> 00:25:23,324
Whoa! Got an itch?

318
00:25:24,727 --> 00:25:27,696
You know, the name of
the game is pool, bubby.

319
00:25:27,763 --> 00:25:29,924
Now, you gonna play it or not?

320
00:25:31,000 --> 00:25:34,231
You know, I shaved twice
since you last shot.

321
00:25:35,438 --> 00:25:37,929
Von Zipper plays
when Von Zipper is ready.

Will you... Will you...
Not here, here.

324
00:26:02,598 --> 00:26:06,227
Let me know when you're
going to play, bubby.

325
00:26:07,369 --> 00:26:09,394
Hey, boss. Come here.

326
00:26:10,639 --> 00:26:13,039
Out! I'll murder you
at the zoo tomorrow. Go.

00:26:13,109 --> 00:26:14,974
All right. Later, daddy.

328
00:26:15,744 --> 00:26:18,406
- Did you lose this, boss?
- Oh, stupid.

- What? What is it? What?
- Read this.

330
00:26:23,385 --> 00:26:26,149
- Look at the picture.

00:26:26,622 --> 00:26:29,250
"Skydiving singer saves surfer. "

Stop the music!
Stop the music! Stop the music!

418
00:31:42,438 --> 00:31:45,737
Stand aside, everyone.
I take large steps.

Well, looks like the carbon monoxide
commandos are back.

call the pest control.

I am Eric Von Zipper,

422
00:31:56,452 --> 00:31:59,979
and I come here to tell you
that these beach bums is bums,

423
00:32:00,088 --> 00:32:03,455
and ain't nobody
making no album with them.

424
00:32:03,525 --> 00:32:08,827
They can make it with me and my cycles.
You could call it Come Cycle With Me.

425
00:32:08,931 --> 00:32:11,627
Oh, perfect.
You'll hear from us. Next.

426
00:32:11,700 --> 00:32:13,531
I got one more thing.

427
00:32:16,371 --> 00:32:18,669
Eric Von Zipper adores you.

428
00:32:18,774 --> 00:32:22,676
And when Eric Von Zipper adores
somebody, they stay adored.

429
00:32:23,479 --> 00:32:25,470
- That's stupid.
- That's stupid.

430
00:32:26,114 --> 00:32:29,174
I am my ideal,
but you are my idol.

431
00:32:29,284 --> 00:32:30,478
Hey, Von Zipper.

432
00:32:30,552 --> 00:32:32,383
Why don't you crawl
back under your rock?

433
00:32:32,488 --> 00:32:34,353
Leave him talk.
He ain't through.

434
00:32:34,456 --> 00:32:37,687
Thanks, J.D.
That's short for Juvenile Delinquent.

435
00:32:37,793 --> 00:32:40,523
From the looks of him,
you wouldn't think he'd ever make it.

436
00:32:40,629 --> 00:32:42,961
Oh, it wasn't easy,
but I helped him.

437
00:32:44,132 --> 00:32:46,862
And these is my two mice,
Puss 'n' Boots.

438
00:32:46,969 --> 00:32:49,199
- I am pleased...
- I am sure.

439
00:32:51,139 --> 00:32:53,039
I thought up them names myself.

440
00:32:53,141 --> 00:32:55,405
You know something?
I believe you.

441
00:32:56,578 --> 00:33:03,006
My idol used to be Marlo Brandon,
but he did a moving picture about cycles.

442
00:33:03,085 --> 00:33:07,886
He made them cycle guys to be bad guys,
so he ain't my idol no more.

443
00:33:08,257 --> 00:33:11,158
You are. I could teach
you how to cycle.

444
00:33:11,527 --> 00:33:15,224
- Well, thanks, but...
- Not too close, Sugar. He's a carrier.

445
00:33:16,431 --> 00:33:20,060
Oh, yeah. I could carry her on my cycle.
It's a nice, healthy sport,

446
00:33:20,168 --> 00:33:24,002
out in the wide open spaces,
just like us. It's nifty!

447
00:33:24,907 --> 00:33:27,535
Now, if you hurry,
you can find lots of wide open spaces

448
00:33:27,609 --> 00:33:29,270
just off the premises.

449
00:33:29,378 --> 00:33:31,005
Him, I don't like.

450
00:33:31,380 --> 00:33:33,348
You, he don't like.

451
00:33:33,715 --> 00:33:35,273
Can I depend on that?

452
00:33:35,384 --> 00:33:37,614
I am even thinking
of giving you the Hima...

453
00:33:37,719 --> 00:33:40,017
- The Hima...
- ... layan.

454
00:33:40,088 --> 00:33:42,283
The Himalayan suspenders treatment.

455
00:33:42,424 --> 00:33:44,187
The Himalayan suspenders?

456
00:33:44,927 --> 00:33:47,418
There's definitely a language barrier here.

457
00:33:47,529 --> 00:33:51,295
It's sort of a judo thing.
Professor-type fella taught it to him.

458
00:33:51,400 --> 00:33:53,095
Oh, yeah, there's really
nothing to it, see.

459
00:33:53,201 --> 00:33:55,396
- All you do is you take your finger...
- Watch it, boss.

460
00:33:55,470 --> 00:33:57,131
Oh, I ain't gonna do it,
not to me, I ain't.

461
00:33:57,239 --> 00:34:00,538
- Is this right?
- That's...

462
00:34:00,609 --> 00:34:02,270
- He done it again.
- Only different.

463
00:34:02,377 --> 00:34:05,403
- Yeah, she gave him the finger.
- By remote control.

464
00:34:07,549 --> 00:34:10,245
Oh, I love this game.
Can you move it out of here?

465
00:34:10,319 --> 00:34:11,718
Come on, let's get him out.

466
00:34:11,787 --> 00:34:13,982
Careful, careful.
Don't break him.

467
00:34:14,089 --> 00:34:16,421
He's fragile. Careful.

468
00:34:16,992 --> 00:34:18,892
Eric Von Zipper will return.

469
00:34:18,961 --> 00:34:22,419
Oh, we can't wait.
Crawl in anytime.

470
00:34:22,497 --> 00:34:24,761
Tooty-toot, Mouseketeers.

471
00:34:27,636 --> 00:34:31,003
- Have you seen Bonehead?
- No. Who looks for Bonehead?

472
00:34:31,106 --> 00:34:33,165
Well, I'm worried.
He hasn't been himself lately.

473
00:34:33,275 --> 00:34:35,470
On him, that should be
considered a piece of luck.

474
00:34:35,577 --> 00:34:38,512
Come on, let's sneak away
and talk about us.

475
00:34:44,286 --> 00:34:48,245
- You came out to look for me. I'm glad.
- Hey, you're the one.

476
00:34:49,024 --> 00:34:51,185
But when I came to,
Sugar was there.

477
00:34:51,293 --> 00:34:53,318
I knew something was fishy.

478
00:34:53,428 --> 00:34:55,293
That's very funny, what you said.

479
00:34:55,364 --> 00:34:58,959
Well, what I mean to say
is thank you for saving my life.

480
00:34:59,034 --> 00:35:00,467
You don't have to thank me.

481
00:35:00,535 --> 00:35:03,629
- Do you live around here?
- Yes, I live around here.

482
00:35:03,705 --> 00:35:07,766
- Well, can I come and see you sometime?
- You're seeing me now.

483
00:35:07,843 --> 00:35:11,802
Well, I mean...
Hey, swim in with me and meet the gang.

484
00:35:11,980 --> 00:35:15,848
- No, I'm sorry.
- Well, can I see you again?

485
00:35:16,385 --> 00:35:17,977
Tomorrow at this same time.

486
00:35:18,053 --> 00:35:20,146
There's a cove
about a half a mile down the beach.

487
00:35:20,222 --> 00:35:22,713
I know where it is. I'll be there.

488
00:35:23,058 --> 00:35:25,822
Oh, I don't know your name.

489
00:35:25,894 --> 00:35:29,728
- Lorelei.
- Lorelei. That's pretty.

490
00:35:30,532 --> 00:35:33,831
- Is there a last name?
- Just Lorelei.

491
00:35:33,902 --> 00:35:36,200
There is something else
you should know about me.

492
00:35:36,304 --> 00:35:39,239
- Yes, what?
- I'm a mermaid.

493
00:35:39,741 --> 00:35:42,369
Some of my best friends
are mermaids, Lorelei.

494
00:35:42,477 --> 00:35:44,240
See you tomorrow.

495
00:36:03,098 --> 00:36:06,158
You know something?
You really are one.

496
00:36:06,234 --> 00:36:07,701
I told you I was.

497
00:36:07,769 --> 00:36:10,738
Well, I knew something was different
about you, but not this different.

498
00:36:10,839 --> 00:36:14,172
- Do you still want to meet me tomorrow?
- Gosh, yes. More than ever.

499
00:36:14,242 --> 00:36:16,710
I've never known a girl with a...

500
00:36:17,512 --> 00:36:22,677
I mean, I'll be the only boy in my block
that knows a real, live mermaid.

501
00:36:28,256 --> 00:36:30,747
- You know what I think?
- No, what?

502
00:36:30,992 --> 00:36:32,653
<i>I think</i>

503
00:36:32,761 --> 00:36:34,319
<i>You think</i>

504
00:36:34,429 --> 00:36:35,919

<i>Love doesn't mean a thing</i>

506
00:36:37,933 --> 00:36:40,800

507
00:36:40,902 --> 00:36:42,961
<i>- ... I think...

508
00:36:43,071 --> 00:36:44,800

<i>It's time we settled down</i>

517
00:36:58,487 --> 00:37:02,116
<i>- With all this thinking going on

00:37:02,190 --> 00:37:05,182
<i>- It really seems to me

00:37:44,366 --> 00:37:45,993

546
00:38:02,984 --> 00:38:06,010
<i>- And you've been thinking a lot about me
- And you've been thinking a lot about me</i>

547
00:38:06,087 --> 00:38:08,146
<i>- Well, I think

548
00:38:08,223 --> 00:38:09,690
<i>- You think

549
00:38:09,758 --> 00:38:11,316
<i>- Why think?
- Why think?</i>

550
00:38:11,393 --> 00:38:13,224
<i>- Let's get together now
- Let's get together now</i>

551
00:38:13,328 --> 00:38:14,852
<i>You know</i>

552
00:38:14,930 --> 00:38:18,388
<i>- I love you
- You know I love you</i>

553
00:38:19,935 --> 00:38:21,596
<i>You know</i>

554
00:38:21,703 --> 00:38:26,367
<i>- I love you
- You know I love you</i>

555
00:38:32,380 --> 00:38:34,541
You keep your feet together,
knees slightly bent,

556
00:38:34,616 --> 00:38:36,083
rolling to the right or left,

557
00:38:36,184 --> 00:38:39,381
taking the force of the impact
on your hips and your shoulders.

558
00:38:39,454 --> 00:38:42,116
Do not look down.
Keep your eyes horizon-level at all times.

559
00:38:42,224 --> 00:38:44,852
- Now, you want to try?
- Okay.

560
00:38:45,460 --> 00:38:48,452
Bend those knees.
There you go.

561
00:38:50,532 --> 00:38:52,932
Very good. Not bad.
Did you see the roll?

562
00:38:53,034 --> 00:38:54,262
- Frankie.
- Yeah?

563
00:38:54,369 --> 00:38:57,634
- You want to give me a hand with this?
- Sure, if you'll show me how.

564
00:38:57,739 --> 00:39:00,731
- Oh, it's easy. Just hold onto it.
- All right.

565
00:39:00,809 --> 00:39:04,540
Now give me your hands.
Fasten the chest strap.

566
00:39:06,248 --> 00:39:08,148
- It's right here.
- All right.

567
00:39:10,585 --> 00:39:12,416
- Is this right?
- Yeah, nice.

568
00:39:13,388 --> 00:39:16,448
Looks like your friend and my friend
are getting pretty friendly.

569
00:39:16,558 --> 00:39:18,458
Now hand me the leg straps.

570
00:39:24,099 --> 00:39:25,225
Good.

571
00:39:26,434 --> 00:39:29,301
- Got it?
- Yeah.

572
00:39:29,905 --> 00:39:32,635
Looks like Bonnie's friend
is just a little jealous.

573
00:39:32,741 --> 00:39:34,140
And you're not?

574
00:39:34,242 --> 00:39:37,803
You're darn right I am.
I'm so mad I could jump.

575
00:39:37,913 --> 00:39:39,278
Be my guest.

576
00:39:46,588 --> 00:39:49,785
- Excuse me.
- Oh, hey, we're not through.

577
00:39:49,858 --> 00:39:51,291
Maybe you're not.

578
00:39:54,996 --> 00:39:57,931
- Hey, you're doing all right.
- Yeah, so are you.

579
00:39:57,999 --> 00:40:02,026
You mean...
Oh, lay off, will you?

580
00:40:02,137 --> 00:40:06,130
- Dee Dee, I love you.
- Don't you "I love you" me.

581
00:40:07,976 --> 00:40:09,136
What?

582
00:40:21,723 --> 00:40:24,283
Hey, Bonehead!
You missed a real kick.

583
00:40:25,360 --> 00:40:28,852
I was right.
Bonehead's really left the scene.

584
00:40:29,230 --> 00:40:30,356
Yeah.

585
00:40:31,032 --> 00:40:33,626
Let's see if we can put
him back in focus.

586
00:40:34,202 --> 00:40:35,464
Bonehead.

587
00:40:37,038 --> 00:40:38,232
Hey, Bonehead.

588
00:40:40,709 --> 00:40:43,837
- Bonehead! Remember me?
- I got something to tell you.

589
00:40:43,912 --> 00:40:47,643
- Tell, Bonehead. We're all ears.
- Her name is Lorelei.

590
00:40:47,716 --> 00:40:51,311
- Whose name is Lorelei?
- This girl, the one who saved me.

591
00:40:51,886 --> 00:40:52,978
Butch.

592
00:40:55,023 --> 00:40:59,687
Bonehead, the girl who saved you,
her name is Sugar. Sugar Kane.

593
00:40:59,761 --> 00:41:02,525
No, that's what everybody thinks,
but it isn't so.

594
00:41:02,597 --> 00:41:05,327
Her name is Lorelei,
and she's a mermaid.

595
00:41:07,602 --> 00:41:10,935
Boney! Boney, are you there?

596
00:41:12,540 --> 00:41:14,440
Hey, I think I've got it.

597
00:41:14,542 --> 00:41:17,375
If anything will pull him
out of a trance, this will.

598
00:41:17,445 --> 00:41:18,844
Be right back.

599
00:41:19,280 --> 00:41:22,841
Bonehead, is there anything you need?
Anything I can get you?

600
00:41:23,451 --> 00:41:24,941
Just Lorelei.

601
00:41:25,587 --> 00:41:26,679
Yeah.

602
00:41:33,361 --> 00:41:35,090
Now, all you have to tell him...

603
00:41:35,196 --> 00:41:37,255
is that he asked you
to the pavilion tonight.

604
00:41:37,365 --> 00:41:38,423
He did?

605
00:41:38,533 --> 00:41:41,024
At the party at your house.
That's what you tell him.

606
00:41:41,102 --> 00:41:42,899
But I remember he didn't.

607
00:41:43,371 --> 00:41:46,465
Well, look, I know he didn't,
but say he did as a favor to me.

608
00:41:46,574 --> 00:41:48,565
I'm trying to pull him out of a trance.

609
00:41:48,643 --> 00:41:51,203
If it's for you, Frankie, I'll do it.

610
00:41:51,479 --> 00:41:54,573
- Thank you.
- Besides, he's kind of cute.

611
00:41:58,053 --> 00:42:01,489
- Bonehead?
- Sugar says it's A-okay for tonight.

612
00:42:01,589 --> 00:42:03,284
- For tonight?
- Yeah, at the pavilion.

613
00:42:03,391 --> 00:42:04,790
You asked me to go.

614
00:42:04,893 --> 00:42:06,656
- I did?
- Well, sure!

615
00:42:06,761 --> 00:42:08,388
And she's all set,
aren't you, Sugar?

616
00:42:08,463 --> 00:42:10,988
I hear you're a real good dancer.
I just can't wait.

617
00:42:11,099 --> 00:42:12,999
Well, swell.

618
00:42:14,803 --> 00:42:18,239
You mind if I talk to Frankie alone
for just a minute?

619
00:42:20,175 --> 00:42:21,665
Go right ahead.

620
00:42:22,610 --> 00:42:24,635
You know this stuff about Lorelei?

621
00:42:24,746 --> 00:42:27,340
It must've been
one of them mirages or something.

622
00:42:27,449 --> 00:42:29,280
Sure. We all get them.

623
00:42:29,350 --> 00:42:33,446
- A mental mind is a terrible thing.
- Man, you know it.

624
00:42:33,855 --> 00:42:38,656
And, Frankie, please, don't say anything
to anybody about the mermaid.

625
00:42:38,760 --> 00:42:40,250
My lips are sealed.

626
00:42:58,546 --> 00:42:59,843
Thanks for coming along, Earl.

627
00:42:59,948 --> 00:43:02,007
I know this isn't
a fancy New York nightclub,

628
00:43:02,117 --> 00:43:04,677
the kind you're used to,
like the 21 Club.

629
00:43:08,957 --> 00:43:12,825
Hi, honey. You look great.
And I'll put you right on.

630
00:43:14,395 --> 00:43:16,329
I've got good news for you, Big Drop.

631
00:43:16,397 --> 00:43:20,026
Don't tell me. Let me guess.
You're leaving?

632
00:43:20,135 --> 00:43:22,160
Now, you gotta stop
making me laugh.

633
00:43:22,237 --> 00:43:25,138
I've got Sugar Kane here with me,
and she'll sing for you.

634
00:43:25,206 --> 00:43:30,567
Who needs girl singers?
Not Big Drop.

635
00:43:30,678 --> 00:43:32,236
I'm in an echo chamber.

636
00:43:32,347 --> 00:43:36,181
For your information,
I've also got Earl Wilson here with me.

637
00:43:37,318 --> 00:43:41,084
Who needs girl singers?
Big Drop.

638
00:43:41,189 --> 00:43:45,355
Tell Miss Kane it'll be our pleasure.

639
00:43:45,426 --> 00:43:48,259
- Perfect. I'll go tell Sugar.
- What is she gonna sing?

640
00:43:48,363 --> 00:43:51,025
Don't worry.
The group's got her music.

641
00:43:52,600 --> 00:43:56,559
Earl? Earl!
There you are. Right over here, Earl.

642
00:43:56,671 --> 00:44:00,664
Sugar, here's Earl again.
And this is... Oh, forget it.

643
00:44:01,743 --> 00:44:04,109
Welcome, kids!
Welcome to the pavilion.

644
00:44:04,212 --> 00:44:07,113
I want you to know
that sitting in our audience right here,

645
00:44:07,215 --> 00:44:08,443
one of the greats.

646
00:44:08,550 --> 00:44:11,451
So great, Earl, I get the chills
every time I mention your name.

647
00:44:11,553 --> 00:44:14,181
One of the greatest writers...
He's cute.

648
00:44:14,255 --> 00:44:18,089
One of the greatest writers of our time,
a sweetheart of a fella, Earl Wilson.

649
00:44:18,193 --> 00:44:19,785
Let's hear it for him.

650
00:44:21,596 --> 00:44:23,689
You're great, Earl.
It's nice to see you.

651
00:44:23,765 --> 00:44:25,756
And I want to tell you
something as a friend.

652
00:44:25,867 --> 00:44:27,095
Somebody tell you you're 11?

653
00:44:27,202 --> 00:44:29,067
Get rid of that hairdo.
You know what I mean?

654
00:44:29,137 --> 00:44:30,695
You don't need the crew-cut haircut.

655
00:44:30,772 --> 00:44:32,706
It's a little embarrassing,
because at your age, Earl...

656
00:44:32,774 --> 00:44:33,866
Please, believe me.

657
00:44:33,942 --> 00:44:35,967
You act as though
you were in the sandbox and you flunked.

658
00:44:36,077 --> 00:44:37,874
You know what I mean, kid?

659
00:44:39,380 --> 00:44:42,577
Frankie and Dee Dee.
Hi, Frankie. Hello, Dee Dee.

660
00:44:42,650 --> 00:44:44,618
Stand up and get sick
for the audience.

661
00:44:44,719 --> 00:44:47,711
You two 43-year-old yo-yos
skipping around the house.

662
00:44:47,789 --> 00:44:49,882
Grow up!
You're a man already, Frank.

663
00:44:49,958 --> 00:44:52,222
How long can you stand
in the bathroom in front of the mirror

664
00:44:52,293 --> 00:44:54,761
going "samba, samba, samba"?

665
00:44:55,163 --> 00:44:57,893
You're 43, Frank.
You're old and wrinkled.

666
00:44:57,966 --> 00:45:01,561
Did you ever hear yourself sing, Frank?
I bet you scare trains.

667
00:45:02,570 --> 00:45:03,798
You sing, Frank, you sound...

668
00:45:03,905 --> 00:45:05,099
I'll be my...

669
00:45:05,173 --> 00:45:07,733
You're old. Let me hear
you say one note. Say...

670
00:45:07,809 --> 00:45:09,834
Wrong! You see what I mean?

671
00:45:09,944 --> 00:45:12,674
That's what I mean! This kid cannot sing.

672
00:45:13,748 --> 00:45:15,613
And I want you to know
one other thing, Dee Dee.

673
00:45:15,683 --> 00:45:17,742
I never liked your personality.

674
00:45:18,019 --> 00:45:21,511
You know what I mean?
You're too short for this type of work.

675
00:45:22,323 --> 00:45:23,915
What are you, a seal?

676
00:45:25,627 --> 00:45:28,824
You're Bonehead, right?
Bonehead, I'm a friend.

677
00:45:28,930 --> 00:45:32,263
I spoke to the Board of Health.
You're gonna be condemned.

678
00:45:32,867 --> 00:45:36,667
Do yourself a favor. Try this.
Spell "pussycat. "

679
00:45:37,338 --> 00:45:38,999
Smart as a whip, huh?

680
00:45:39,107 --> 00:45:42,008
But I want you to know something.
I have nothing against kids.

681
00:45:42,110 --> 00:45:44,670
I don't mind...
I don't mind kids as a whole.

682
00:45:44,779 --> 00:45:47,612
In a group, they annoy me a little bit.

683
00:45:47,682 --> 00:45:50,674
So we're in for a big treat.
Right, Hondells?

684
00:45:50,785 --> 00:45:52,013
Right.

685
00:45:54,122 --> 00:45:57,683
We have a marvelous singer here,
and she's Miss Sugar Kane.

686
00:45:57,792 --> 00:46:00,852
So here she is,
Miss Sugar Kane and the Hondells.

687
00:46:12,707 --> 00:46:15,835
<i>Fly boy</i>

688
00:46:15,910 --> 00:46:18,572
<i>Fly boy.</i>

689
00:46:18,680 --> 00:46:21,706
<i>I want to tell you
about a friend of mine</i>

690
00:46:21,816 --> 00:46:24,876
<i>I love him so he drives
me out of my mind</i>

691
00:46:24,986 --> 00:46:27,819
- She's gonna be a big star, right, Earl?
- Yeah. She's very good.

692
00:46:27,889 --> 00:46:31,586
The biggest. Big with the kids, too.

693
00:46:31,693 --> 00:46:33,854
<i>Flying in his flying machine</i>

694
00:46:33,928 --> 00:46:36,726
<i>High in the sky
now we're making the scene</i>

695
00:46:36,798 --> 00:46:38,732
<i>He's like an angel
well, you know what I mean</i>

696
00:46:38,800 --> 00:46:41,234
They shouldn't be dancing!
Boy. Big Drop!

697
00:46:41,302 --> 00:46:42,929
<i>He's my fly boy</i>

698
00:46:43,037 --> 00:46:46,097
<i>Up in the sky on top of the world</i>

699
00:46:46,207 --> 00:46:49,142
<i>We're in heaven above</i>

700
00:46:49,243 --> 00:46:52,110
<i>He's my guy and I'm his girl</i>

701
00:46:52,213 --> 00:46:53,805
<i>What a way to fall in love</i>

702
00:46:53,915 --> 00:46:56,213
I bet Dee Dee
would rather be dancing with you.

703
00:46:56,284 --> 00:46:58,115
And you'd rather be
dancing with Frankie.

704
00:46:58,219 --> 00:47:00,551
- I didn't say that.
- You didn't have to.

705
00:47:00,621 --> 00:47:02,714
- How'd you guess?
- Oh, it was fairly easy.

706
00:47:02,790 --> 00:47:05,554
You're nuts about the guy.
You can't take your eyes off of him.

707
00:47:05,626 --> 00:47:07,924
Well, I was never a subtle type chick.

708
00:47:07,995 --> 00:47:11,158
Okay, you want games?
I'll go along.

709
00:47:19,474 --> 00:47:22,500
<i>We're up in the sky
on top of the world</i>

710
00:47:22,610 --> 00:47:24,601
<i>We're in heaven above</i>

711
00:47:25,780 --> 00:47:28,681
<i>He's my guy and I'm his girl</i>

712
00:47:28,783 --> 00:47:31,752
<i>What a way to fall in love</i>

713
00:47:31,819 --> 00:47:34,913
<i>What a way to fall in love.</i>

714
00:47:34,989 --> 00:47:36,684
<i>Now I know he's got
me under his spell</i>

715
00:47:36,791 --> 00:47:39,954
- Did she maneuver this?
- Sort of.

716
00:47:41,763 --> 00:47:44,425
You're not doing her any favors
by letting her get away with it.

717
00:47:44,499 --> 00:47:47,195
<i>He's my fly boy</i>

718
00:47:47,301 --> 00:47:48,632
<i>Fly boy</i>

719
00:47:48,703 --> 00:47:51,763
<i>My fly boy</i>

720
00:47:56,043 --> 00:47:59,501
<i>He's my fly boy</i>

721
00:48:12,527 --> 00:48:14,688
And Earl just thinks you're great.
Tell her, Earl.

722
00:48:14,796 --> 00:48:16,457
- Congratulations.
- Thank you.

723
00:48:16,531 --> 00:48:17,896
You're in, honey.

724
00:48:17,999 --> 00:48:21,730
- Come on, Bonehead. Let's go.
- Go? We just got here.

725
00:48:21,836 --> 00:48:25,237
I don't mean just go.
I mean go, go, go, like dance.

726
00:48:25,339 --> 00:48:26,863
Oh, sure!

727
00:48:38,686 --> 00:48:40,551
Did you ever do anything
like that, Earl?

728
00:48:40,655 --> 00:48:44,352
Once back in Ohio,
when I got caught in a swarm of bees.

729
00:48:48,863 --> 00:48:52,094
- Bonehead, you're just not with it.
- I guess you're right.

730
00:48:52,200 --> 00:48:54,498
Would you like to take
a walk along the beach?

731
00:48:54,569 --> 00:48:55,661
Sure!

732
00:49:12,019 --> 00:49:15,011
Oh, isn't it wonderful?
The water's so beautiful.

733
00:49:15,089 --> 00:49:17,717
Yeah, it sure does cool off
our dancing dogs.

734
00:49:17,792 --> 00:49:20,522
Yeah, it's real cool.

735
00:49:20,595 --> 00:49:23,564
- Do you hear that?
- Hear what?

736
00:49:23,631 --> 00:49:26,429
Music, real soft and pretty.

737
00:49:27,969 --> 00:49:32,030
I hear the music from the pavilion.
It's pretty, but it sure isn't soft.

738
00:49:32,106 --> 00:49:34,199
Well, I've been wrong before.

739
00:49:34,909 --> 00:49:37,469
Something bit me!
I'm getting out of here.

740
00:49:45,419 --> 00:49:47,410
It's a people bite!

741
00:49:48,289 --> 00:49:49,950
Well, what do you know?

742
00:49:51,559 --> 00:49:53,117
I'm late for a date.

743
00:50:00,067 --> 00:50:01,432
Hey, Frank.

744
00:50:01,769 --> 00:50:03,930
I was only kidding before
about your singing.

745
00:50:04,005 --> 00:50:06,940
I know you can sing.
Come on up here and prove it.

746
00:50:16,284 --> 00:50:18,752
<i>These are</i>

747
00:50:18,819 --> 00:50:24,451
<i>The good times</i>

748
00:50:24,525 --> 00:50:29,485
<i>While we are young</i>

749
00:50:29,597 --> 00:50:35,035
<i>No chance untaken</i>

750
00:50:35,136 --> 00:50:40,597
<i>No song unsung</i>

751
00:50:40,675 --> 00:50:45,874
<i>These are the good times</i>

752
00:50:45,980 --> 00:50:51,316
<i>Life goes your way</i>

753
00:50:51,385 --> 00:50:56,652
<i>Loving each moment</i>

754
00:50:56,724 --> 00:51:01,821
<i>Of each new day</i>

755
00:51:03,397 --> 00:51:08,494
<i>While the meadows are green</i>

756
00:51:08,569 --> 00:51:14,667
<i>Free as the wind are we</i>

757
00:51:14,742 --> 00:51:18,735
<i>Sharing a dream</i>

758
00:51:18,846 --> 00:51:22,646
<i>Living our destiny</i>

00:51:27,421 --> 00:51:32,984
<i>Long as you care</i>

761
00:51:33,060 --> 00:51:38,498
<i>All of the good times</i>

762
00:51:38,566 --> 00:51:43,526
<i>We'll always share</i>

763
00:51:44,338 --> 00:51:46,499
I'm gonna give him a bravo.
He's terrific.

764
00:51:46,574 --> 00:51:48,508
- Oh, you think so?
- Yeah.

765
00:51:48,576 --> 00:51:50,942
Sugar taught him everything he knows.

766
00:51:56,584 --> 00:52:00,452
<i>Sharing a dream</i>

772
00:52:23,077 --> 00:52:30,040
<i>Share</i>

773
00:52:43,130 --> 00:52:44,596
He sings like a bird.

774
00:52:44,597 --> 00:52:47,794
Yeah? Well, let's see
if he can fly like one.

775
00:52:50,104 --> 00:52:54,473
Hey, Frankie, you'd better turn in early.
Tomorrow you make your first jump.

776
00:52:54,575 --> 00:52:55,803
Nice of you to let me know.

777
00:52:55,910 --> 00:52:58,310
Don't let him push you, Frankie.
You're not ready.

778
00:52:58,412 --> 00:53:00,073
Frankie does all right
at everything he tries.

779
00:53:00,147 --> 00:53:04,584
- I've noticed. I think he's ready.
- You're cute. Like a cobra.

780
00:53:05,119 --> 00:53:09,283
I'll see you tomorrow at Big Drop's,
and if you're late, I'll start without you.

781
00:53:09,356 --> 00:53:11,824
- Now get lost.
- Sure.

782
00:53:13,661 --> 00:53:16,289
Are you gonna let him
tell you what to do?

783
00:53:16,363 --> 00:53:20,959
- What would you have wanted me to say?
- You're not only stubborn, you're stupid.

784
00:53:23,871 --> 00:53:26,135
You know, she's got a point.

785
00:53:38,319 --> 00:53:39,513
Lorelei?

786
00:53:45,192 --> 00:53:46,784
Lorelei!

787
00:53:53,367 --> 00:53:56,803
- Frankie, this is wrong, and you know it.
- She's right, Frankie.

788
00:53:56,871 --> 00:54:00,500
- Let's hope not.
- He's so full of pride and integrity.

789
00:54:00,574 --> 00:54:02,838
Yeah, he's full of it, all right.

790
00:54:02,910 --> 00:54:06,505
Look, Dee Dee, I'm not gonna chicken out.
If Steve thinks I'm ready, I'm ready.

791
00:54:06,580 --> 00:54:09,344
- Steve, is he ready?
- It's up to Frankie.

792
00:54:09,416 --> 00:54:10,747
Let's go.

793
00:54:18,092 --> 00:54:20,026
Well, looks like I'm on.

794
00:54:20,094 --> 00:54:23,222
What are you waiting for, chickie baby,
to lay an egg?

795
00:54:23,497 --> 00:54:25,089
So long, Stevie!

796
00:54:32,273 --> 00:54:33,672
There he goes!

797
00:54:40,214 --> 00:54:43,672
Hey, that's way out.
Too much.

798
00:54:48,389 --> 00:54:51,256
That kid's got no guts.
I told you he was chicken.

799
00:55:11,412 --> 00:55:13,277
Frankie, you were just great!

800
00:55:13,380 --> 00:55:15,610
I couldn't have done it better myself,
if I could've done it.

801
00:55:15,716 --> 00:55:17,581
- Which I wouldn't.
- It was wild!

802
00:55:17,651 --> 00:55:20,381
Hey, where's the plane?
I want to do it again.

803
00:55:39,406 --> 00:55:40,930
Hello.

804
00:55:41,942 --> 00:55:45,503
Oh. I made it from the parachute I found
on the bottom of the ocean.

805
00:55:45,613 --> 00:55:47,171
Does it please you?

806
00:55:47,281 --> 00:55:49,442
Well, it's not that, Lorelei.

807
00:55:50,117 --> 00:55:53,575
Oh. Well, mermaids can have legs
for a short time on land.

808
00:55:53,654 --> 00:55:57,249
- I thought that would please you, too.
- You were sure right about that.

809
00:55:57,324 --> 00:56:00,316
- Can we sit and talk?
- Sure.

810
00:56:10,004 --> 00:56:12,700
There's lots of stuff
I need to know about you.

811
00:56:13,173 --> 00:56:15,937
You sure have pretty legs.
For a fish, that is.

812
00:56:16,010 --> 00:56:19,639
- How come you speak English?
- Well, mermaids speak all languages.

813
00:56:19,713 --> 00:56:23,149
We've helped sailors from all the ports
of the world for thousands of years.

814
00:56:23,217 --> 00:56:26,015
I'm not a sailor,
but I was a Sea Scout.

815
00:56:26,387 --> 00:56:29,823
- And I'm sure glad you helped me.
- Well, so am I,

816
00:56:29,890 --> 00:56:34,122
because in all my 300 years,
I've never met a human I really liked.

817
00:56:34,194 --> 00:56:36,492
You're 300 years old?

818
00:56:37,031 --> 00:56:40,159
- Gosh, you sure don't look it.
- Well, I suppose I never will.

819
00:56:40,234 --> 00:56:42,668
You mean you'll always look like this?

820
00:56:43,871 --> 00:56:44,963
Wow!

821
00:56:46,573 --> 00:56:49,736
Well, that means... Just wow!

822
00:56:50,844 --> 00:56:53,745
- How long can you keep your legs?
- Until midnight.

823
00:56:53,847 --> 00:56:57,010
- Then what?
- Well, then I return to the sea.

824
00:56:57,084 --> 00:57:00,053
- You ask too many questions.
- Just one more.

825
00:57:00,154 --> 00:57:01,746
Will you go out with me tonight?

826
00:57:01,855 --> 00:57:04,688
And I want you to meet
a couple of friends of mine. Okay?

827
00:57:04,792 --> 00:57:09,229
- But you won't tell them I'm a mermaid?
- Believe me, they wouldn't believe me.

828
00:57:09,330 --> 00:57:13,824
- I've got to buy you some clothes.
- Clothes. I'll never understand why.

829
00:57:13,901 --> 00:57:16,961
Neither will I.
What size do you wear?

830
00:57:17,638 --> 00:57:19,003
Size?

831
00:57:19,206 --> 00:57:22,403
Well, I guess we'll have to
work this out by hand.

832
00:57:24,812 --> 00:57:27,212
Now, let's see. Bust.

833
00:57:30,551 --> 00:57:33,213
- About like that.
- Do that again. I like it.

834
00:57:33,320 --> 00:57:36,346
Please, Lorelei, I'm busy.
Now, waist.

835
00:57:39,026 --> 00:57:40,391
About there.

836
00:57:40,761 --> 00:57:42,752
And hips.

837
00:57:46,166 --> 00:57:49,932
Well, that ought to do it.
Oh, no. Shoes.

838
00:57:51,538 --> 00:57:52,766
Exactly two for one.

839
00:57:52,873 --> 00:57:56,673
Now, you wait here, Lorelei,
and I'll bring you everything you need.

840
00:57:56,744 --> 00:57:59,269
Bonehead, do that first
thing again, please.

841
00:57:59,380 --> 00:58:00,574
Well...

842
00:58:03,417 --> 00:58:06,386
Lorelei, do you know
about the birds and the bees?

843
00:58:06,453 --> 00:58:07,511
No.

844
00:58:07,588 --> 00:58:10,887
Well, I better get out of here,
or you're gonna find out.

845
00:58:22,903 --> 00:58:25,895
- Wish me luck, Frankie!
- Look, Dee Dee, this is crazy!

846
00:58:25,973 --> 00:58:28,737
I was only putting you on
when I said you wouldn't jump.

847
00:58:28,809 --> 00:58:32,108
Oh, get buster here.
Women can't do anything.

848
00:58:32,212 --> 00:58:34,271
They can't jump.
They can't fly.

849
00:58:34,882 --> 00:58:36,941
Be my guest. I'll show you.

850
00:58:37,051 --> 00:58:40,214
Okay, I'll go.
Just to make sure she doesn't jump.

851
00:58:40,287 --> 00:58:44,121
She'll jump! She's all heart.
I'll show you I'm all heart.

852
00:58:44,224 --> 00:58:47,421
If her chute don't open,
she don't owe me a cent.

853
00:58:48,595 --> 00:58:50,722
Look, Dee Dee,
you don't have to prove anything.

854
00:58:50,798 --> 00:58:52,425
I believe you want to do it.

855
00:58:52,499 --> 00:58:55,935
I believe it, too,
and that's what I have to prove.

856
00:59:14,588 --> 00:59:16,681
I wonder if I'll ever get
the nerve to do that.

857
00:59:16,790 --> 00:59:20,282
I wouldn't advise it.
You'd have too much to lose. Me.

858
00:59:28,035 --> 00:59:31,300
Okay, Dee Dee, step outside
and get some fresh air.

859
00:59:32,473 --> 00:59:34,668
Dee Dee, you're not gonna
go through with this.

860
00:59:34,775 --> 00:59:38,108
You can stop me if you want to, Frankie,
but please don't.

861
00:59:38,178 --> 00:59:41,341
I have to do this for me.
Do you understand that?

862
00:59:58,532 --> 01:00:01,968
- Her chute didn't open!
- She's gonna do a free fall.

863
01:00:19,219 --> 01:00:20,584
Pull it.

864
01:00:35,169 --> 01:00:36,329
She made it.

865
01:00:36,403 --> 01:00:39,998
When a girl makes up her mind,
she gets anything she wants.

866
01:00:40,073 --> 01:00:43,372
- Now we're gonna talk about you?
- Us.

867
01:00:45,913 --> 01:00:49,371
- Somebody's got to drive this thing.
- It's on automatic pilot.

868
01:00:49,449 --> 01:00:52,213
- Now, Bonnie, listen. I...
- You listen.

869
01:00:52,386 --> 01:00:55,549
Here we are, all alone,
way up high.

870
01:00:56,290 --> 01:00:58,053
Just the two of us.

871
01:00:58,592 --> 01:01:04,053
- Yeah, but somebody down there likes me.
- Well, somebody up here likes you, too.

872
01:01:04,431 --> 01:01:06,456
Bonnie, you may have turned it
on automatic pilot,

873
01:01:06,567 --> 01:01:08,228
but I'm not on the same switch.

874
01:01:08,302 --> 01:01:11,135
You don't get all your kicks
from surfing, do you?

875
01:01:11,238 --> 01:01:13,968
Well, of course not,
but this is ridiculous.

876
01:01:14,074 --> 01:01:15,939
It's really wild up there.

877
01:01:16,043 --> 01:01:18,443
She's got the plane on automatic pilot.

878
01:01:21,114 --> 01:01:24,311
- But why?
- It's hard to fly with your arms full.

879
01:01:24,418 --> 01:01:27,615
- No dice, Frankie?
- I'm not even in the game.

880
01:01:28,755 --> 01:01:31,781
Well, I just dealt you in.

881
01:01:32,459 --> 01:01:34,620
Steve won't like this very much.

882
01:01:34,728 --> 01:01:38,494
Look, Bonnie, you're a nice kid.
You don't need all this phony jazz.

883
01:01:38,599 --> 01:01:41,295
I'm not used to having people
say no to me.

884
01:01:41,401 --> 01:01:42,493
Well, that's the trouble.

885
01:01:42,603 --> 01:01:44,833
If more people said no,
you wouldn't act like this.

886
01:01:44,938 --> 01:01:46,428
I'm gonna break him in two.

887
01:01:46,506 --> 01:01:50,272
There's something you should know.
Frankie's small, but he's wiry.

888
01:01:54,081 --> 01:01:55,241
Steve!

889
01:01:55,315 --> 01:01:57,283
Oh, Steve, I just can't tell you
what happened!

890
01:01:57,351 --> 01:01:58,443
I can.

891
01:01:58,518 --> 01:02:01,316
It was terrible, and there I was, helpless,
all alone up there.

892
01:02:01,421 --> 01:02:03,753
- I suppose he put it on automatic pilot?
- Steve, he forced me.

893
01:02:03,824 --> 01:02:05,348
- Come off it, Bonnie.
- Hey, why don't you wise up?

894
01:02:05,459 --> 01:02:07,154
Keep out of this.
Nobody makes a monkey out of me.

895
01:02:07,261 --> 01:02:09,923
Now, wait a second. You listen to me.
This whole thing is your fault.

896
01:02:09,997 --> 01:02:11,589
If you'd get off
the jealous kick with Bonnie,

897
01:02:11,665 --> 01:02:12,825
she wouldn't be looking around.

898
01:02:12,933 --> 01:02:15,458
It's not me she's interested in,
or anybody else. It's you.

899
01:02:15,535 --> 01:02:17,002
That's right. You.

900
01:02:17,371 --> 01:02:21,205
She just wants proof you care about her,
and this is her way of getting it.

901
01:02:21,308 --> 01:02:23,503
So if you really care,
you ought to let her know it

902
01:02:23,610 --> 01:02:25,544
and knock off the silly games.

903
01:02:30,617 --> 01:02:33,814
- Maybe he's right.
- He may be right, but he's gonna be sorry.

904
01:02:33,887 --> 01:02:36,947
Nobody makes
a monkey out of Steve but Steve.

905
01:02:41,028 --> 01:02:42,393
Well, I hope it fits.

906
01:02:42,496 --> 01:02:45,954
The lady in the store
was real nice about making sure.

907
01:02:47,200 --> 01:02:48,360
Okay.

908
01:02:51,138 --> 01:02:54,164
- You like it?
- Wait till the gang sees you.

909
01:02:54,241 --> 01:02:55,333
Let's go!

910
01:02:56,176 --> 01:02:57,336
High heels.

911
01:02:57,978 --> 01:03:00,071
You shouldn't wear them
in the sand, anyway.

912
01:03:00,180 --> 01:03:01,306
Here.

913
01:03:01,715 --> 01:03:04,343
You will have to forgive me.
It's my first time, you know.

914
01:03:04,418 --> 01:03:05,578
Yeah, I know the feeling.

915
01:03:05,686 --> 01:03:09,850
I remember the first time I wore shoes.
It was about a year ago.

916
01:03:16,763 --> 01:03:18,731
<i>They go a lot of places</i>

917
01:03:18,832 --> 01:03:22,563
<i>And they have a lot of fun</i>

918
01:03:22,669 --> 01:03:24,364
<i>Hill climbing in the mountains</i>

919
01:03:24,438 --> 01:03:27,532
<i>Or for a desert run</i>

920
01:03:27,607 --> 01:03:29,768
<i>And when I get a little bike</i>

921
01:03:29,876 --> 01:03:31,400
<i>Now, you can just bet</i>

922
01:03:31,511 --> 01:03:37,347
<i>I'm gonna be a member of the cycle set</i>

923
01:03:37,417 --> 01:03:38,884
<i>I'm gonna take my money</i>

924
01:03:38,985 --> 01:03:42,921
<i>And I'm gonna put it away</i>

925
01:03:43,023 --> 01:03:46,550
<i>And bank every paycheck
when it comes to payday</i>

926
01:03:46,660 --> 01:03:47,752
Dance.

927
01:03:47,861 --> 01:03:50,091
<i>I'm gonna pay it up in cash</i>

928
01:03:50,197 --> 01:03:51,755
<i>So I won't be in debt</i>

929
01:03:51,865 --> 01:03:53,492
<i>Then we'll ride my bike</i>

930
01:03:53,567 --> 01:03:57,833
<i>With the cycle set</i>

931
01:04:08,081 --> 01:04:12,415
<i>Of the cycle set</i>

932
01:04:12,519 --> 01:04:17,957
<i>I saw a little bike
and the price was just right</i>

933
01:04:18,058 --> 01:04:19,685
<i>So I'm gonna take my money</i>

934
01:04:19,760 --> 01:04:22,923
<i>And I'll pick it up tonight</i>

935
01:04:23,029 --> 01:04:25,259
<i>And I'm with a real pretty chick</i>

936
01:04:25,365 --> 01:04:26,764
<i>That I just met</i>

937
01:04:26,867 --> 01:04:29,199
<i>We're gonna ride together
with the cycle set</i>

938
01:04:29,269 --> 01:04:30,702
Come on, Dee Dee, let's dance.

939
01:04:30,771 --> 01:04:32,864
- Let's go, Lorelei.
- Bonehead?

940
01:04:32,939 --> 01:04:36,534
Gee, I don't feel like a bonehead with you.
I feel different.

941
01:04:36,610 --> 01:04:38,703
Tell me more about the
birds and the bees.

942
01:04:38,779 --> 01:04:42,044
Well, it's like when
you get a certain feeling coming over you.

943
01:04:42,115 --> 01:04:45,050
- You mean, like falling in love?
- Yeah, that's it.

944
01:04:45,118 --> 01:04:48,645
And I'm beginning to get it now.
Maybe we'd better dance.

945
01:04:49,923 --> 01:04:51,891
<i>I'm gonna ride my cycle</i>

946
01:04:51,958 --> 01:04:55,052
<i>With the cycle set</i>

947
01:04:55,128 --> 01:04:58,222
If that's dancing,
I'm afraid I can't do it.

948
01:04:58,298 --> 01:05:02,234
Well, when this is over,
I'll ask him to play something slower.

949
01:05:02,302 --> 01:05:07,262
<i>We're gonna ride my cycle
with the cycle set</i>

950
01:05:20,954 --> 01:05:23,684
Earl, I don't know
why you're so crazy about this place.

951
01:05:23,790 --> 01:05:26,315
I just want to do a
little more research.

952
01:05:26,460 --> 01:05:29,361
- Which girl is it, Earl?
- Oh, come on now.

953
01:05:42,676 --> 01:05:44,644
They must've raided the place.

954
01:05:45,278 --> 01:05:47,041
We'll sit over here, Earl.

955
01:05:50,817 --> 01:05:53,513
That's indecent.
They're touching each other.

956
01:05:53,620 --> 01:05:56,214
I knew there was something
about it I liked.

957
01:06:55,448 --> 01:06:59,714
Why me?
Why me all the time?

958
01:07:03,256 --> 01:07:07,215
It's a shame there wasn't soap in it.
It would've been his first bath.

959
01:07:09,629 --> 01:07:11,620
Hey, that was nifty, boss.

960
01:07:12,799 --> 01:07:17,027
You see anything funny in that?

961
01:07:18,705 --> 01:07:21,071
- She likes it.
- What?

962
01:07:23,410 --> 01:07:25,105
It's the Black Plague.

963
01:07:28,315 --> 01:07:30,715
Do you find this type
of fun relaxing?

964
01:07:32,485 --> 01:07:33,884
Start the music!

965
01:07:40,961 --> 01:07:43,156
Where's Sugar?
Where's my idol?

966
01:07:43,263 --> 01:07:45,925
- She ain't here, boss.
- Yeah, we been looking around.

967
01:07:45,999 --> 01:07:48,627
Later we will go get her
'cause I adore her.

968
01:08:01,839 --> 01:08:03,670
Hey, boss, look!

969
01:08:03,850 --> 01:08:07,616
I seen his pictures in the column
in the newspaper I read to you every day.

970
01:08:07,687 --> 01:08:11,088
That's Earl Wilson.
You know, Earl's Pearls.

971
01:08:11,958 --> 01:08:13,186
Oh, sure!

972
01:08:16,830 --> 01:08:19,298
Hey, Earl, how about tossing a pearl?

973
01:08:19,532 --> 01:08:21,329
Before swine?

974
01:08:22,369 --> 01:08:25,361
That's good.
Right like that, he... Him, I like.

975
01:08:25,472 --> 01:08:27,770
You just lost a lot of points, Earl.

976
01:08:27,841 --> 01:08:31,208
Please, do not destroy my mood.
Tonight, I even like you.

977
01:08:31,311 --> 01:08:34,508
Oh, perfect.
I'll save the next dance for you.

978
01:08:34,981 --> 01:08:36,039
I lead.

979
01:08:37,150 --> 01:08:39,380
Come on.
Let's go find my idol.

980
01:08:40,553 --> 01:08:43,488
- It's almost time.
- Oh, yeah. We gotta be going.

981
01:08:43,556 --> 01:08:46,150
Do you have to leave so early?
We're just getting acquainted.

982
01:08:46,226 --> 01:08:48,694
Well, I promised Lorelei
I'd get her home before midnight.

983
01:08:48,795 --> 01:08:51,696
What, does she turn into a pumpkin
or something?

984
01:08:52,198 --> 01:08:53,358
Something like that.

985
01:08:53,466 --> 01:08:55,832
It was nice knowing you.
I hope to see you again.

986
01:08:55,902 --> 01:08:56,994
- Thank you.
- It's nice meeting you.

987
01:08:57,070 --> 01:09:00,164
- Nice meeting you.
- Oh, come on, Goo Goo.

988
01:09:00,974 --> 01:09:02,066
Good night.

989
01:09:02,175 --> 01:09:03,301
- Good night.
- Good night.

990
01:09:03,376 --> 01:09:06,209
- Bye.
- She's a nice girl.

991
01:09:06,312 --> 01:09:08,974
Yeah, but there's something
strange about her.

992
01:09:09,049 --> 01:09:13,418
I don't know. She just seems out of place.
Like a fish out of water.

993
01:09:44,718 --> 01:09:47,186
Okay, now, everybody quiet.

994
01:09:47,353 --> 01:09:51,346
I don't want nobody to wake up my idol
until I wake her up myself.

995
01:09:51,958 --> 01:09:53,619
'Cause I adore her.

996
01:09:53,727 --> 01:09:55,251
- Right?
- Right!

997
01:09:55,361 --> 01:09:56,726
Quiet, will you?

998
01:10:16,282 --> 01:10:19,513
You stupids! This ain't no way
to run a kidnapping.

999
01:10:19,586 --> 01:10:20,951
Sorry, boss.

1000
01:10:21,087 --> 01:10:22,850
Do like I do and you
will learn things.

1001
01:10:22,922 --> 01:10:24,856
Jerome, fix it.

1002
01:10:29,863 --> 01:10:31,524
Follow your leader.

1003
01:10:32,932 --> 01:10:36,060
My hat. Where's my hat?
My hat.

1004
01:10:53,553 --> 01:10:56,317
Be quiet. Quiet.

1005
01:11:08,067 --> 01:11:11,764
Next time I bring you stupids along,
I will go by myself.

1006
01:11:15,742 --> 01:11:18,176
My idol fell asleep with the TV on.

1007
01:11:35,261 --> 01:11:37,786
Marlo Brandon never
looked like this.

1008
01:11:38,665 --> 01:11:40,257
Get her some clothes.

1009
01:11:40,500 --> 01:11:44,766
I don't want no idol of mine to freeze,
'cause I adore her.

1010
01:11:54,180 --> 01:11:55,704
What are you doing?

1011
01:11:56,049 --> 01:11:57,983
I'm glad you asked that question,

1012
01:11:58,051 --> 01:12:01,111
because I, Eric Von Zipper,
am putting the snatch on you.

1013
01:12:01,187 --> 01:12:02,313
Snatch?

1014
01:12:02,388 --> 01:12:07,325
Yeah. I'm kidnapping you,
only it's more romantic, like eloping.

1015
01:12:08,661 --> 01:12:12,188
- Did Bullets think this up?
- I, Eric Von Zipper, thunk it up.

1016
01:12:12,899 --> 01:12:15,663
- I think it's marvy.
- Nifty.

1017
01:12:17,136 --> 01:12:18,831
- You need any help, boss?
- No!

1018
01:12:18,905 --> 01:12:20,702
I'd rather do it myself.

1019
01:12:23,009 --> 01:12:25,477
Whoa. I may... Gee, she's...

1020
01:12:25,545 --> 01:12:27,513
Help me. Help me!

1021
01:12:32,018 --> 01:12:35,181
I've always worn this.
Now I want you to wear it.

1022
01:12:40,493 --> 01:12:42,222
Bonehead, I love you.

1023
01:12:42,662 --> 01:12:46,564
You said what I was gonna say.
Only, why so sad?

1024
01:12:47,500 --> 01:12:50,663
- Because we have to say goodbye.
- Goodbye?

1025
01:12:50,737 --> 01:12:52,068
I'm sorry.

1026
01:12:53,706 --> 01:12:56,174
If I didn't love you,
it would be easy.

1027
01:12:56,242 --> 01:13:00,941
But if we love each other,
why can't we take what we have now?

1028
01:13:01,047 --> 01:13:02,571
Don't tempt me.

1029
01:13:03,249 --> 01:13:05,740
The memory of it would haunt
me for the rest of my life,

1030
01:13:05,852 --> 01:13:07,877
and for me, that's a long time.

1031
01:13:10,056 --> 01:13:11,353
You know I'm right.

1032
01:13:11,424 --> 01:13:14,120
You are what you are,
and I am what I am.

1033
01:13:14,894 --> 01:13:16,418
We just don't belong.

1034
01:13:35,982 --> 01:13:37,244
Lorelei.

1035
01:13:39,953 --> 01:13:42,285
Please don't.
I'm going home now.

1036
01:14:41,381 --> 01:14:45,943
Easy, easy. That was good.
This time you even hit the white ball.

1037
01:14:46,019 --> 01:14:48,544
See? You're learning.
I bet you them beach bums

1038
01:14:48,654 --> 01:14:51,214
ain't never been
in a decent pool hall in their lives.

1039
01:14:51,324 --> 01:14:55,351
Are we playing pool, bubby,
or is this all a lousy dream?

1040
01:14:56,329 --> 01:14:58,490
There happens to be a lady present.

1041
01:14:58,698 --> 01:15:01,394
- I apologize.
- That's nice.

1042
01:15:01,501 --> 01:15:04,834
And after you learn pool,
I'm gonna learn you how to cycle.

1043
01:15:04,904 --> 01:15:07,873
You're gonna become
Eric Von Zipper's progidy.

1044
01:15:07,974 --> 01:15:11,410
- It all sounds marvy.
- Yeah, nifty.

1045
01:15:12,712 --> 01:15:14,873
Hey, how would you like a malted?

1046
01:15:15,014 --> 01:15:16,504
Sounds super!

1047
01:15:17,417 --> 01:15:20,250
Well, why are you standing here?
The lady wants a malted.

1048
01:15:20,353 --> 01:15:23,584
Get her a malted!
And make it a double!

1049
01:15:24,090 --> 01:15:25,352
A double!

1050
01:15:32,832 --> 01:15:36,529
All right, out with it.
What did you do with her?

1051
01:15:36,736 --> 01:15:38,226
I didn't do anything.

1052
01:15:38,337 --> 01:15:41,898
She went under this wave,
and that was the last time I saw her.

1053
01:15:42,208 --> 01:15:45,609
He drowned her.
This brute drowned Sugar Kane!

1054
01:15:45,711 --> 01:15:48,942
- Sugar? Who's talking about her?
- Sugar's missing?

1055
01:15:49,048 --> 01:15:52,176
I missed her at 8:00 a. m. bed checks.
She's gone!

1056
01:15:52,251 --> 01:15:54,185
Know anything about it, Bonehead?

1057
01:15:54,253 --> 01:15:55,686
Just 'cause I was burying clothes

1058
01:15:55,755 --> 01:15:57,848
doesn't mean
I know anything about Sugar.

1059
01:15:57,924 --> 01:15:59,289
Burying clothes?

1060
01:15:59,392 --> 01:16:01,622
It is kind of a coincidence.
You have to admit that.

1061
01:16:01,727 --> 01:16:04,525
Those were Lorelei's clothes.
Lorelei, the mermaid.

1062
01:16:04,597 --> 01:16:07,725
- Mermaid?
- Oh, Lorelei's a mermaid.

1063
01:16:09,102 --> 01:16:12,902
Sure. She took her clothes off
and went back into the ocean.

1064
01:16:12,972 --> 01:16:15,805
I didn't know what to do
with her clothes, so...

1065
01:16:16,442 --> 01:16:19,741
- Oh, what's the use?
- What's the use?

1066
01:16:19,812 --> 01:16:22,303
Relax, Bullets. It's all my fault.

1067
01:16:22,415 --> 01:16:25,976
Sugar and I cooked it up
between ourselves for a publicity gag.

1068
01:16:26,452 --> 01:16:28,613
Drowning as publicity?

1069
01:16:29,455 --> 01:16:33,050
- Even I wouldn't do that.
- Look, nobody drowned anybody.

1070
01:16:33,126 --> 01:16:36,789
Headlines. "Girl singer disappears.
Found by boy surfers. "

1071
01:16:36,896 --> 01:16:39,126
Good for you and
good for us, right?

1072
01:16:39,532 --> 01:16:40,760
Perfect.

1073
01:16:41,434 --> 01:16:44,631
I should've thought of it myself.
Now, where is she?

1074
01:16:44,737 --> 01:16:47,262
Give it a few more hours,
and you'll have her back. I promise.

1075
01:16:47,373 --> 01:16:50,467
She'll be on the beach this afternoon
right after Frankie and I do our free fall.

1076
01:16:50,576 --> 01:16:52,237
She will?
I mean, she will.

1077
01:16:52,311 --> 01:16:55,747
You know something?
You're a good kid, kid.

1078
01:16:56,749 --> 01:16:59,149
I'll get right to the papers,
and if anybody asks,

1079
01:16:59,252 --> 01:17:01,243
I did think of it myself.

1080
01:17:03,556 --> 01:17:06,821
- All right, Bonehead. Now, where is she?
- Well, I thought you said you knew.

1081
01:17:06,926 --> 01:17:08,791
I only made up that jazz
to get rid of Bullets.

1082
01:17:08,895 --> 01:17:10,157
Now, come on. Let's have it.

1083
01:17:10,263 --> 01:17:13,824
Look, Frankie, I'm being honest.
I don't know anything about Sugar.

1084
01:17:13,933 --> 01:17:17,334
I took Lorelei home last night
and we said goodbye.

1085
01:17:17,770 --> 01:17:21,467
Bonehead, Frankie is only trying to help.
He's your friend.

1086
01:17:25,845 --> 01:17:29,804
- He's not even listening!
- Listening? Sure I am.

1087
01:17:30,283 --> 01:17:32,843
- Don't you hear it?
- Hear what?

1088
01:17:33,352 --> 01:17:34,614
So long.

1089
01:17:35,154 --> 01:17:36,348
- See you later.
- Wait a second.

1090
01:17:36,455 --> 01:17:40,516
Don't forget what we told Bullets.
This afternoon, she'd better be here.

1091
01:18:06,652 --> 01:18:08,176
"Von Zipper?"

1092
01:18:14,327 --> 01:18:16,557
That's it.
And with my help,

1093
01:18:16,662 --> 01:18:19,961
you're gonna be the best lady pool player
in this entire pool room.

1094
01:18:20,032 --> 01:18:21,363
Marvy!

1095
01:18:21,667 --> 01:18:24,727
- Before the Rats come back...
- The mice want to play.

1096
01:18:25,204 --> 01:18:28,196
- We could kill that kid.
- That's the idea.

1097
01:18:28,407 --> 01:18:30,898
Leave it to old Slim. I got ideas,

1098
01:18:31,510 --> 01:18:33,535
and they're all vile, baby.

1099
01:18:33,746 --> 01:18:35,543
- Marvy!
- Marvy!

1100
01:18:40,353 --> 01:18:42,344
You're a regular Minnesota Fats.

1101
01:18:42,421 --> 01:18:44,514
It's all right, Sugar, I'm here.

1102
01:18:44,590 --> 01:18:48,856
- You stupid! I was here first.
- And you're gonna stay here.

1103
01:18:49,028 --> 01:18:50,996
Why me? Why always me?

1104
01:18:52,164 --> 01:18:53,529
Let's go, Sugar.

1105
01:18:54,900 --> 01:18:57,266
You're gonna stay here,
too, bubby.

1106
01:18:58,738 --> 01:19:00,569
Come to your daddy.

1107
01:19:00,673 --> 01:19:03,164
I'm gonna take you to
my bubby house.

1108
01:19:03,609 --> 01:19:05,338
There you go, baby.

1109
01:19:10,349 --> 01:19:12,681
I think I'm gonna need some help.

1110
01:19:15,721 --> 01:19:19,350
- Anything new with Bonehead?
- Nothing, and I'm worried about him.

1111
01:19:19,425 --> 01:19:21,586
It's you two I'm worried about.

1112
01:19:21,927 --> 01:19:24,054
Steve's still wigged about Frankie.

1113
01:19:24,130 --> 01:19:26,098
Well, why don't you take us up?

1114
01:19:26,198 --> 01:19:29,429
I already suggested that
to Steve. No go.

1115
01:19:30,770 --> 01:19:34,433
- Oh, what can he do?
- There's a lot he can do.

1116
01:19:40,479 --> 01:19:42,242
Hey, here they come!

1117
01:19:46,085 --> 01:19:47,382
Frankie, I'm worried.

1118
01:19:47,453 --> 01:19:49,978
Do you think
Bonnie might have been right?

1119
01:19:50,990 --> 01:19:54,289
My girl's worried.
Any reason she should be?

1120
01:19:54,393 --> 01:19:56,987
No reason at all.
Or for you, either.

1121
01:19:57,997 --> 01:20:00,488
First one down's a rotten skydiver.

1122
01:20:09,041 --> 01:20:11,908
Look at that! Too much.

1123
01:20:27,159 --> 01:20:28,751
Oh, out of sight!

1124
01:20:38,671 --> 01:20:40,036
We gotta try it.

1125
01:20:52,451 --> 01:20:55,511
- Open! Open those chutes!
- What's the matter?

1126
01:20:55,621 --> 01:20:58,886
At the speed they're falling,
that water's like concrete.

1127
01:21:22,014 --> 01:21:23,675
That's groovy.

1128
01:21:23,749 --> 01:21:26,183
Not so groovy.
They opened too late.

1129
01:21:26,252 --> 01:21:28,311
Come on! Let's go! Come on!

1130
01:22:09,428 --> 01:22:10,690
Lorelei.

1131
01:22:20,139 --> 01:22:21,367
Lorelei!

1132
01:23:10,456 --> 01:23:13,254
Hey, Frankie, skydiving's groovy,
but let's stick to surfing.

1133
01:23:13,325 --> 01:23:14,622
Yeah.

1134
01:23:14,960 --> 01:23:16,450
You know something?

1135
01:23:17,596 --> 01:23:19,757
A kiss is worth more
than a thousand words.

1136
01:23:19,832 --> 01:23:21,993
Then why don't you stop talking?

1137
01:23:28,607 --> 01:23:30,666
- All right, where is she?
- Where's who?

1138
01:23:30,776 --> 01:23:31,936
You know very well who.

1139
01:23:32,011 --> 01:23:33,501
I mean, I brought Earl here
because you said...

1140
01:23:33,612 --> 01:23:37,104
Frankie, I found Sugar.
They've got her at that pool hall.

1141
01:23:37,182 --> 01:23:39,582
- Who's got her?
- Von Zipper's got her.

1142
01:23:39,652 --> 01:23:40,812
Von Zipper?

1143
01:23:40,920 --> 01:23:43,753
The Rat Pack social director.
And you promised me...

1144
01:23:43,822 --> 01:23:46,620
And I'm gonna keep my promise.
Okay, you guys, let's go!

1145
01:23:46,692 --> 01:23:48,319
Cowabunga!

1146
01:23:51,597 --> 01:23:55,033
- "Cowabunga?"
- I don't know, Earl, but let's go.

1147
01:23:57,202 --> 01:24:00,103
- You know, I've been thinking.
- Watch it, boss.

1148
01:24:00,306 --> 01:24:04,800
Where is my idol and South Dakota Slim
and my two mice, Puss 'n' Boots?

1149
01:24:04,877 --> 01:24:06,139
First you win the game for me, boss,

1150
01:24:06,211 --> 01:24:07,803
and then when
you're nice and relaxed, I'll tell you.

1151
01:24:07,880 --> 01:24:09,108
Oh, okay.

1152
01:24:09,848 --> 01:24:10,974
Watch this.

1153
01:24:20,392 --> 01:24:22,553
There they are.
Let's rack them up!

1154
01:25:19,952 --> 01:25:23,080
Wait a minute! Wait a minute!
What are we fighting about?

1155
01:25:23,188 --> 01:25:25,247
You've got Sugar!
Where is she?

1156
01:25:25,357 --> 01:25:27,757
- I ain't got Sugar. Where is she?
- I was gonna tell you, boss.

1157
01:25:27,860 --> 01:25:30,852
I got a hunch South Dakota Slim
took her to his bubby house.

1158
01:25:30,929 --> 01:25:32,396
- You mean the old sawmill?
- Yeah.

1159
01:25:32,464 --> 01:25:35,627
Sawmill? Why, it's right out
of The Perils of Pauline.

1160
01:25:35,734 --> 01:25:37,201
It's Pearl White revisited.

1161
01:25:37,269 --> 01:25:38,896
We'll see you later.

1162
01:25:38,971 --> 01:25:41,371
Follow me. Whistle, whistle.

1163
01:25:41,440 --> 01:25:42,907
That's Earl, brother.

1164
01:25:42,975 --> 01:25:45,409
Yeah, Earl, while there's still a door.

1165
01:25:50,449 --> 01:25:53,247
- Whistle.
- Get them, guys!

1166
01:27:00,552 --> 01:27:03,646
Why me?
Why me all the time?

1167
01:28:58,425 --> 01:29:00,086
Tasty.

1168
01:29:03,507 --> 01:29:06,271
Now the show starts, bubbies.

1169
01:29:09,680 --> 01:29:13,446
Fine. Fine! Fine!

1170
01:29:14,485 --> 01:29:18,319
You know, the name of this
game is murder, bubbies.

1171
01:29:20,257 --> 01:29:22,987
Oh, fine.
This is gonna be good.

1172
01:29:23,093 --> 01:29:28,156
I seen this in my favorite picture,
The Perils of Pauline.

1173
01:29:30,934 --> 01:29:33,198
I don't think this is very nice.

1174
01:29:33,771 --> 01:29:35,830
No, I think it's kind of mean.

1175
01:29:37,508 --> 01:29:41,069
Hold it!
No one can criticize old Slim.

1176
01:29:41,145 --> 01:29:45,946
I'll show you old Slim
hasn't got a mean bone in his body.

1177
01:29:46,650 --> 01:29:49,847
I'm gonna apply
the anesthesia to you, darling.

1178
01:29:50,154 --> 01:29:54,887
I've got hasenpfeffer.
I've got a little bit of...

1179
01:29:56,527 --> 01:29:58,290
There she is.

1180
01:29:58,362 --> 01:30:02,765
This anesthesia works
every time, bubby.

1181
01:30:05,702 --> 01:30:07,033
Come on, Sugar, let's go!

1182
01:30:07,137 --> 01:30:09,697
Yeah, we may be rotten, Sug,
but we're not this rotten.

1183
01:30:14,678 --> 01:30:16,441
It works every time.

1184
01:30:22,820 --> 01:30:25,220
What are you doing
with my bubby there?

1185
01:30:25,622 --> 01:30:29,615
Step aside, ladies.
That's my Sugar, bubbies.

1186
01:30:30,828 --> 01:30:34,457
- You give me back my idol! Right?
- Right!

1187
01:30:36,200 --> 01:30:39,226
- Bull's-eye.
- Hey, boss!

1188
01:30:40,838 --> 01:30:42,237
Come on!

1189
01:30:43,073 --> 01:30:46,236
Sugar, your daddy's gonna
take you to his new lab!

1190
01:30:46,343 --> 01:30:48,334
Come on, my little bauble.

1191
01:30:51,248 --> 01:30:52,909
- Come here!
- Boss?

1192
01:30:55,018 --> 01:30:56,645
Nobody takes my Sugar!

1193
01:31:01,558 --> 01:31:03,492
Now you've got yours, bubby!

1194
01:31:04,228 --> 01:31:05,559
Why, you...

1195
01:31:09,766 --> 01:31:13,600
I'm the king bubby around here!
Come right up and get me!

1196
01:31:13,704 --> 01:31:15,604
Where's my little Sugar?

1197
01:31:20,277 --> 01:31:23,508
You watch your daddy
operate now, Sugar.

1198
01:31:35,526 --> 01:31:38,927
Come on, bubbies!
Hey, bubby!

1199
01:31:39,029 --> 01:31:40,587
Here's your daddy!

1200
01:31:42,299 --> 01:31:46,065
Come here!
Come on, now! Come on, man!

1201
01:31:56,613 --> 01:31:59,605
Why me?
Why me all the time?

1202
01:32:05,489 --> 01:32:08,583
I'm gonna give you a little
entertainment. Yeah!

1203
01:32:15,332 --> 01:32:16,424
Sugar.

1204
01:32:16,900 --> 01:32:19,300
- You all right?
- My hero!

1205
01:32:21,138 --> 01:32:24,130
I do all the work and he
gets all the credit.

1206
01:32:25,142 --> 01:32:26,803
Well, that's life.

1207
01:32:28,779 --> 01:32:32,840
Why are you hitting? Stop hitting me!
Will you let go? You stupids!

1208
01:32:33,850 --> 01:32:35,317
Okay, let's go.

1209
01:32:49,032 --> 01:32:50,499
What a story.

1210
01:32:50,667 --> 01:32:54,159
Surfer saves singer. Singer saves surfer.

1211
01:32:54,638 --> 01:32:56,128
Surfer saves...

1212
01:32:56,640 --> 01:32:58,801
I'll let Earl string these pearls.

1213
01:33:02,045 --> 01:33:03,342
Bonehead,

1214
01:33:04,281 --> 01:33:05,714
about that mermaid...

1215
01:33:05,816 --> 01:33:09,183
I was kidding.
There never was any mermaid.

1216
01:33:09,286 --> 01:33:13,985
The girl who pulled me in this afternoon,
she asked me to give you this.

1217
01:33:18,195 --> 01:33:20,026
Oh, here comes Boney.

1218
01:33:22,232 --> 01:33:24,496
- Hi, Sugar.
- Hi.

1219
01:33:26,536 --> 01:33:28,970
This is so romantic, Bonehead.

1220
01:33:29,172 --> 01:33:32,699
It's like we were brought together
by some mystery of the sea.

1221
01:33:33,076 --> 01:33:35,806
I knew he was stupid,
but sickening, too?

1222
01:33:41,485 --> 01:33:43,510
Was there really a mermaid?

1223
01:33:44,755 --> 01:33:47,519
Is there a moon? Is there a sky?

1224
