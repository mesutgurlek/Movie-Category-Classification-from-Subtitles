1
00:01:45,622 --> 00:01:48,750
Hi, I'm Neal,
a typical Indian guy,

2
00:01:49,125 --> 00:01:51,093
But there's nothing
typically Indian about me.

3
00:01:51,294 --> 00:01:52,761
I've never even been to India!

4
00:01:52,962 --> 00:01:55,760
Dad was a farmer there,
he sowed oats.

5
00:01:55,965 --> 00:01:59,423
But now, he rears horses!

6
00:01:59,636 --> 00:02:02,230
After settling in Canada,
Dad brought Mom from Punjab.

7
00:02:02,639 --> 00:02:05,039
The result of their 25 years of
hard work is not me

8
00:02:05,308 --> 00:02:07,242
it's Albert, their horse!

9
00:02:09,012 --> 00:02:11,003
You go gaga when you see
pretty women,

10
00:02:11,214 --> 00:02:12,681
You forget all about me!

11
00:02:13,149 --> 00:02:15,344
I make the tea, I cook the meals.

12
00:02:15,552 --> 00:02:16,280
And they get the kisses?

13
00:02:16,486 --> 00:02:18,750
What rubbish! When did you
cook meals for the horse?

14
00:02:19,088 --> 00:02:21,318
Come on! Let's take a picture!

15
00:02:21,524 --> 00:02:22,513
Don't touch me!

16
00:02:22,725 --> 00:02:25,819
Mom and Dad are very cute.
They can't stay without each other.

17
00:02:26,029 --> 00:02:28,259
And when they're together,
they're always fighting!

18
00:02:29,199 --> 00:02:30,826
Unfortunately,
both of them are very happy!

19
00:02:33,036 --> 00:02:34,867
And now they want
to see me happy.

20
00:02:35,071 --> 00:02:36,163
They want me to get married!

21
00:02:36,639 --> 00:02:39,870
Me! The Neal!
Don't get me wrong...

22
00:02:40,276 --> 00:02:42,506
I don't have a problem with girls,
they love me!

23
00:02:42,612 --> 00:02:44,079
Neal! He rocks,
and he's the one to score!

24
00:02:44,314 --> 00:02:47,477
You thought you've seen the best,
but he's here to show you more!

25
00:02:47,784 --> 00:02:52,050
N E A L! Go Neal!

26
00:02:52,288 --> 00:02:55,689
They tell the whole world,
that they're crazy about me!

27
00:02:55,925 --> 00:02:58,621
I'm kidding.
Girls aren't that crazy!

28
00:03:00,230 --> 00:03:01,754
It's not that I don't want
to get married.

29
00:03:01,965 --> 00:03:03,455
But you need to choose
the right kind of girl,

30
00:03:03,666 --> 00:03:05,497
not this domesticated,
homely type, you know!

31
00:03:05,702 --> 00:03:08,671
I've told Mom,
I'm the athletic type I like football.

32
00:03:09,539 --> 00:03:14,374
Then I have the perfect girl,
she's also very sporty and athletic...

33
00:03:14,577 --> 00:03:16,238
...just like you!

34
00:03:17,046 --> 00:03:18,172
Hi! I'm Minni!

35
00:03:19,749 --> 00:03:20,716
Wanna play?

36
00:03:27,657 --> 00:03:29,887
If I don't have any kids in the future...

37
00:03:30,093 --> 00:03:31,185
...it's all thanks to Minni!

38
00:03:33,062 --> 00:03:34,893
Neal, look who's here!

39
00:03:35,098 --> 00:03:38,295
Your Daddy's best friend,
Harpreet Uncle...

40
00:03:38,768 --> 00:03:43,933
and Cherry Aunty,
and their daughter Katrina!

41
00:03:46,042 --> 00:03:47,270
Niiiice!

42
00:03:48,344 --> 00:03:49,038
Hello!

43
00:03:49,612 --> 00:03:52,308
Hello! - How you doing?

44
00:03:53,783 --> 00:03:55,250
Ok, what's wrong with her?

45
00:03:55,551 --> 00:03:57,883
She's pretty... forget pretty,
she's hot!

46
00:03:58,321 --> 00:04:01,119
What are you saying Neal?
Mom and Dad actually got it right?

47
00:04:02,158 --> 00:04:05,184
Damn, I wish this was as simple as
buying a car.

48
00:04:05,628 --> 00:04:07,755
Actually, when buying a car,
you can test drive it.

49
00:04:08,064 --> 00:04:11,898
You can check how to handle it,
its power, it's smoothness

50
00:04:12,101 --> 00:04:13,966
Can it handle curves?

51
00:04:14,170 --> 00:04:15,330
Did you say something?

52
00:04:15,538 --> 00:04:17,563
Would you like to go for a drive?

53
00:04:18,474 --> 00:04:20,032
I'd love to - Great!

54
00:04:21,744 --> 00:04:24,804
Harpreet come!
Let me show you my horse!

55
00:04:25,014 --> 00:04:27,539
He's won all possible awards!

56
00:04:27,750 --> 00:04:30,150
He's so proud of him, he praises him
in every word he utters!

57
00:04:30,353 --> 00:04:34,289
Why shouldn't I be? You can recognize
his breeding in everything he does!

58
00:04:34,657 --> 00:04:37,091
He lives up to the Punjabi name!

59
00:04:40,330 --> 00:04:41,695
You go girl!

60
00:04:43,733 --> 00:04:47,897
What happened? It's a little big,
but there's no need to be worried!

61
00:04:48,104 --> 00:04:49,503
What? - Mummy.

62
00:04:50,473 --> 00:04:51,735
Oh my God!

63
00:04:52,909 --> 00:04:53,933
Hello!

64
00:04:54,143 --> 00:04:56,475
Meet Gyaniji!
His job is to impart wisdom,

65
00:04:56,679 --> 00:04:58,738
but its only me that he imparts it to,

66
00:04:58,948 --> 00:05:00,609
And I am forced to listen to it
because in our house...

67
00:05:00,817 --> 00:05:02,717
...Gyaniji's place comes
right after "Babaji's.

68
00:05:02,919 --> 00:05:05,615
Half of Mom's sentences start with
"Gyaniji was saying.

69
00:05:05,822 --> 00:05:09,656
I was saying there is no need to worry.

70
00:05:09,859 --> 00:05:11,690
And this is Gyaniji's son, Happy.

71
00:05:12,128 --> 00:05:15,359
Sardar with a Guitar,
who wants to be a Rockstar!

72
00:05:15,665 --> 00:05:17,565
Gyaniji, what should I do?

73
00:05:17,767 --> 00:05:21,965
Start the marriage preparations,
the girl for Neal, will come from Bhatinda.

74
00:05:22,171 --> 00:05:31,136
"A pretty girl from Bhatinda..."

75
00:05:32,181 --> 00:05:35,014
"...dressed in pink attire..."

76
00:05:35,218 --> 00:05:37,982
"...and silver sequined shoes."

77
00:05:38,187 --> 00:05:40,917
"The cadence of her flowing tresses..."

78
00:05:41,124 --> 00:05:43,991
"...makes the fields go wild with gushes."

79
00:05:44,193 --> 00:05:46,923
"She's loved by God."

80
00:05:47,130 --> 00:05:49,860
"She's loved by all!"

81
00:05:50,066 --> 00:05:52,967
"Her face is sweet, her soul is sweet!"

82
00:05:53,169 --> 00:05:58,903
"Everyone calls her Sweety!"

83
00:05:59,108 --> 00:06:05,911
"Everyone calls her Sweety!"

84
00:06:10,720 --> 00:06:13,518
Neal, what're you doing?
I can't believe you're getting married!

85
00:06:13,723 --> 00:06:15,088
Why did I give you so much advice?

86
00:06:15,291 --> 00:06:18,021
Marriage is not a good thing.
Do we look like happy guys?

87
00:06:18,227 --> 00:06:19,660
Look what his wife has done to him...

88
00:06:19,862 --> 00:06:21,193
...he's got to wear tight clothes
all the time!

89
00:06:21,397 --> 00:06:23,592
As soon as I got married
my life was over.

90
00:06:23,800 --> 00:06:25,324
After this you're pretty much done.

91
00:06:26,569 --> 00:06:28,298
How could you say yes
for the wedding?

92
00:06:28,504 --> 00:06:31,029
A girl from Bhatinda?
You haven't even met her!

93
00:06:31,274 --> 00:06:32,832
Stop panicking guys, Relax.

94
00:06:33,042 --> 00:06:34,202
I decided a long time ago

95
00:06:34,410 --> 00:06:35,240
that I will have an arranged marriage.

96
00:06:35,445 --> 00:06:36,070
Why?

97
00:06:37,046 --> 00:06:38,513
Have you seen my girlfriends?

98
00:06:39,148 --> 00:06:41,207
Will you marry any one of them?

99
00:06:41,784 --> 00:06:45,618
It's simple dude!
I don't trust my choice in women!

100
00:06:46,122 --> 00:06:48,852
That's why I said yes to marry Sweety!

101
00:06:55,898 --> 00:07:00,130
Dad in a few days I'll be married
and my life will change forever.

102
00:07:00,670 --> 00:07:02,433
And then you know
what's going to happen next.

103
00:07:03,039 --> 00:07:06,566
I want to spend the remaining
21 days in Vancouver.

104
00:07:06,843 --> 00:07:09,175
You know, big city, lots of fun.

105
00:07:09,879 --> 00:07:12,313
Dad, I just want to have some fun.

106
00:07:12,648 --> 00:07:18,018
Neal, why do you think
married guys don't have fun?

107
00:07:18,221 --> 00:07:26,390
Dad, are you having fun?
- Go son, go!

108
00:07:27,029 --> 00:07:28,690
You sure? - Sure.

109
00:07:28,931 --> 00:07:30,899
Dad, ya? - Ya!

110
00:07:31,667 --> 00:07:33,259
Hello Vancouver!!

111
00:07:40,476 --> 00:07:42,103
"Vancouver here I come!"

112
00:07:51,821 --> 00:07:56,121
"Right here in Vancouver
I'm gonna get a lover."

113
00:07:56,325 --> 00:08:00,625
"She'll come to me my baby,
heavens what I'm after."

114
00:08:00,830 --> 00:08:04,960
"This is my big chance,
to rock and roll and dance."

115
00:08:05,168 --> 00:08:09,298
"I want to party harder,
searching for romance."

116
00:08:09,505 --> 00:08:14,465
"O' God, this guy is so lovelorn."

117
00:08:14,677 --> 00:08:18,807
"Gosh! He fails to
understand this norm."

118
00:08:19,015 --> 00:08:23,475
"That it takes time for
the hearts to grow fond."

119
00:08:23,686 --> 00:08:27,486
"Love takes time to bond."

120
00:08:27,690 --> 00:08:32,821
"God, this guy is so lovelorn."

121
00:08:33,029 --> 00:08:37,557
"Gosh! He fails to
understand this norm."

122
00:08:46,876 --> 00:08:48,844
"And when I meet my baby."

123
00:08:49,045 --> 00:08:51,013
"She's going to drive me crazy."

124
00:08:51,214 --> 00:08:55,674
"Don't know what I would do
that would get me high and hazy."

125
00:08:55,885 --> 00:09:00,345
"This is the city where
I'm gonna get some action."

126
00:09:00,556 --> 00:09:04,515
"Just wanna have some fun,
get some satisfaction."

127
00:09:04,727 --> 00:09:09,187
"That it takes time for
the hearts to grow fond."

128
00:09:09,398 --> 00:09:13,528
"Love takes time to bond."

129
00:09:14,237 --> 00:09:18,196
"Right here in Vancouver
I'm going to get a lover."

130
00:09:18,407 --> 00:09:23,242
"O' God, this guy is so lovelorn."

131
00:09:23,579 --> 00:09:26,139
So here's the plan,
I have 21 days.

132
00:09:26,549 --> 00:09:28,983
And in these 21 days,
I am going to meet 21 girls,

133
00:09:29,452 --> 00:09:30,646
So, who's going to be the number 1?

134
00:09:34,223 --> 00:09:35,918
Yeah! I am almost there.
Just chill.

135
00:09:36,459 --> 00:09:39,360
Oh! I am sorry!
I didn't realize this cab was taken!

136
00:09:39,595 --> 00:09:44,623
I am running so late, can I please have
this cab? I will do anything. - Anything.

137
00:09:45,234 --> 00:09:47,828
Where do you have to go?
- Robson and 12th.

138
00:09:48,037 --> 00:09:48,833
Really. - Ya?

139
00:09:49,038 --> 00:09:52,132
Cause I am going to
Robson and 13th.

140
00:09:52,341 --> 00:09:55,037
So can I share this cab with you?
- Ya, sure.

141
00:09:55,244 --> 00:09:57,940
Thank you so much.
- Any time.

142
00:09:58,881 --> 00:10:02,044
Papaji, Robson and 12th please.
- Sure.

143
00:10:02,418 --> 00:10:04,079
Thanks.
- You are welcome.

144
00:10:18,934 --> 00:10:20,868
Oh, my phone.

145
00:10:22,038 --> 00:10:22,970
There's my phone.

146
00:10:24,740 --> 00:10:26,765
So aren't you going to ask me out?

147
00:10:27,910 --> 00:10:29,673
Would you say yes?
- Yes!

148
00:10:30,913 --> 00:10:32,244
Will you have dinner with me?

149
00:10:32,448 --> 00:10:35,713
No... but how about a drink tonight?
Seven thirty at the beach house?

150
00:10:36,252 --> 00:10:37,276
Ya!

151
00:10:37,720 --> 00:10:42,623
Alright! Oh, by the way there is
no Robson and 13th.

152
00:10:42,825 --> 00:10:44,452
There isn't? - No.

153
00:10:44,794 --> 00:10:45,658
See you tonight.

154
00:10:48,864 --> 00:10:53,358
Wow! You sure have
a way with women!

155
00:10:53,569 --> 00:10:55,935
Do you know who she is?
- Who is she?

156
00:10:56,405 --> 00:10:57,895
Check that out!

157
00:11:21,597 --> 00:11:23,997
You hoo, waiter. Waiter.

158
00:11:26,335 --> 00:11:27,131
You're talking to me?

159
00:11:27,336 --> 00:11:31,500
Ya... I need a corkscrew.

160
00:11:31,774 --> 00:11:33,765
I'm not a waiter!

161
00:11:35,444 --> 00:11:36,911
Liar.

162
00:11:40,049 --> 00:11:42,847
Liar. Liar.

163
00:11:43,052 --> 00:11:45,384
Look, I'm not a waiter.
I'm just Neal.

164
00:11:45,888 --> 00:11:46,684
Hi Neal.

165
00:11:47,223 --> 00:11:48,952
You've hidden it, haven't you? - Huh?

166
00:11:49,158 --> 00:11:50,352
There! - Excuse me?

167
00:11:50,559 --> 00:11:52,026
Don't lie! - I'm not lying!

168
00:11:52,228 --> 00:11:53,092
Give it to me! - Give what?

169
00:11:53,295 --> 00:11:54,523
Just give it to me. - Give what?

170
00:11:54,730 --> 00:11:56,357
Just give me the corkscrew!

171
00:11:56,565 --> 00:11:57,327
Hey, hey what are you doing?

172
00:11:57,533 --> 00:12:00,195
Give it to me! Look you're cute.

173
00:12:00,503 --> 00:12:02,095
But you talk too much.

174
00:12:02,304 --> 00:12:02,770
Give it to me!

175
00:12:02,972 --> 00:12:03,870
Having fun?

176
00:12:06,709 --> 00:12:10,167
Carry on. Don't let me stop you.
- Okay.

177
00:12:10,379 --> 00:12:12,006
Oh, my God, do you know
what you have done?

178
00:12:12,214 --> 00:12:13,112
Take your hands off.

179
00:12:13,582 --> 00:12:14,571
Do you know who she is?

180
00:12:14,917 --> 00:12:15,849
I was on a date.

181
00:12:21,123 --> 00:12:23,614
Hey, excuse me, hello,
I am really sorry.

182
00:12:23,826 --> 00:12:25,794
This girl was just trying to
get her hands in to my pants.

183
00:12:25,995 --> 00:12:26,984
I mean, she was looking
for a corkscrew...

184
00:12:27,196 --> 00:12:28,163
...she thought I was a waiter.

185
00:12:28,364 --> 00:12:30,662
Don't worry about it, just forget it.
Let's start all over. - Sure.

186
00:12:30,866 --> 00:12:33,494
I'm Kristy.
- Hi Kristy, I'm Neal.

187
00:12:34,403 --> 00:12:36,064
And how about that
glass of red wine?

188
00:12:36,739 --> 00:12:37,706
Coming right up.

189
00:12:38,073 --> 00:12:40,667
Hello? Excuse me? Can someone
get me a drink please?

190
00:12:40,976 --> 00:12:41,806
Bartender?

191
00:12:46,682 --> 00:12:47,512
Hey...

192
00:12:47,750 --> 00:12:50,378
What are you doing here?
- I work here!

193
00:12:50,586 --> 00:12:52,144
Then what were you
doing outside?

194
00:12:52,855 --> 00:12:55,449
I was on a break... dumb waiter.

195
00:12:56,525 --> 00:12:58,686
Anyway. May I get 2
red wines please?

196
00:12:58,894 --> 00:12:59,656
Sure.

197
00:13:05,201 --> 00:13:05,895
How much?

198
00:13:07,970 --> 00:13:10,063
It's on me! - Thanks.

199
00:13:10,272 --> 00:13:11,705
Cheers! - Cheers!

200
00:13:15,811 --> 00:13:18,245
Have you been drinking?
- No.

201
00:13:18,481 --> 00:13:21,712
I just saw you, you are fired!
- You can't fire me.

202
00:13:21,917 --> 00:13:23,976
Why not?
- Because I quit.

203
00:13:24,186 --> 00:13:26,120
Hey Kristy, here you go.
- Thanks.

204
00:13:27,389 --> 00:13:28,981
So you look like you can dance?

205
00:13:29,325 --> 00:13:31,759
Yes... Well, I have a couple of moves.

206
00:13:33,295 --> 00:13:38,460
Aren't you going to ask me dance?
- Ya.

207
00:14:14,503 --> 00:14:16,801
"No anklets on my feet"

208
00:14:17,006 --> 00:14:18,701
"No bangles in my hands"

209
00:14:18,908 --> 00:14:22,002
"But I'm still searching for the one"

210
00:14:22,678 --> 00:14:25,670
"No kohl in my eyes"

211
00:14:25,881 --> 00:14:27,644
"No bindi on my forehead"

212
00:14:27,850 --> 00:14:30,683
"But I'm still looking
for my lover's alley"

213
00:14:31,387 --> 00:14:34,550
"Whoa, I want to show my body"

214
00:14:34,757 --> 00:14:40,923
"Groove the night away"

215
00:14:41,230 --> 00:14:45,132
"My heart just wants
to find its lover"

216
00:14:45,334 --> 00:14:53,605
"Let's swing, let's dance!"

217
00:14:53,809 --> 00:14:58,212
"Let's sing, let's prance!"

218
00:14:58,447 --> 00:15:06,650
"Let's swing, let's dance!"

219
00:15:06,855 --> 00:15:12,054
"Let's sing, let's prance!"

220
00:15:42,424 --> 00:15:50,695
"I don't know who these eyes
are searching for"

221
00:15:51,133 --> 00:15:58,630
"I don't know who these eyes
are searching for"

222
00:15:58,841 --> 00:16:02,937
"For who I shall break
all the world's traditions"

223
00:16:03,145 --> 00:16:07,479
"Who fulfills his vows
and completes his promises"

224
00:16:07,683 --> 00:16:11,710
"I want to meet him
even if my heart bursts open"

225
00:16:12,054 --> 00:16:16,013
"I won't be in control,
he'll also lose control!"

226
00:16:16,225 --> 00:16:19,353
"Whoa, I want to show my body"

227
00:16:19,628 --> 00:16:24,964
"Groove the night away"

228
00:16:25,167 --> 00:16:30,036
"My heart just wants
to find its lover!"

229
00:16:30,239 --> 00:16:38,442
"Let's swing, let's dance!"

230
00:16:38,647 --> 00:16:43,482
"Let's sing, let's prance!"

231
00:17:18,554 --> 00:17:19,486
Nice song eh?

232
00:17:21,156 --> 00:17:23,647
It's pretty interesting but
I don't understand the words.

233
00:17:24,526 --> 00:17:26,323
You know I make some pretty
awesome music too.

234
00:17:27,730 --> 00:17:29,925
Really? - Ya, you wanna hear?

235
00:17:31,100 --> 00:17:35,867
I 'd love to
- Great, let's bounce.

236
00:17:37,072 --> 00:17:45,275
"I think I see my lover
somewhere here"

237
00:17:45,848 --> 00:17:53,311
"I think I see my lover
somewhere here"

238
00:17:53,522 --> 00:17:57,652
"For my lover,
I'll cross all my limits"

239
00:17:57,860 --> 00:18:01,956
"I'll pledge my life completely to him"

240
00:18:02,164 --> 00:18:06,362
"I just want to say,
he is my treasure"

241
00:18:06,568 --> 00:18:11,733
"If he hugs me now,
I'll die happier"

242
00:18:12,007 --> 00:18:13,736
"Whoa, I want to show my body"

243
00:18:13,876 --> 00:18:15,969
"Groove the night away"

244
00:18:18,881 --> 00:18:24,581
"My heart just wants
to find its lover!"

245
00:18:24,787 --> 00:18:33,092
"Let's swing, let's dance!"

246
00:18:33,295 --> 00:18:37,755
"Let's sing, let's prance!"

247
00:18:37,966 --> 00:18:46,032
"Let's swing, let's dance!"

248
00:18:46,241 --> 00:18:50,769
"Let's sing, let's prance!"

249
00:19:03,959 --> 00:19:05,688
Take me home!

250
00:19:05,894 --> 00:19:07,020
What?

251
00:19:08,063 --> 00:19:10,395
Take me home!

252
00:19:10,499 --> 00:19:14,629
Hey guys, the band will be back shortly.
Till then, enjoy the drinks and the groove.

253
00:19:16,004 --> 00:19:22,341
Taxi! Taxi!
Taxi, Taxi...

254
00:19:22,578 --> 00:19:25,342
Girl's just want to have fun...

255
00:19:25,647 --> 00:19:27,205
Where's a taxi when you need one?

256
00:19:27,416 --> 00:19:30,385
Is there anyone around? Taxi!

257
00:19:32,921 --> 00:19:33,546
One second.

258
00:19:39,561 --> 00:19:41,825
Hey come on,
let's get out of here.

259
00:19:42,030 --> 00:19:44,225
No. - Why?

260
00:19:46,335 --> 00:19:47,996
Carry me. - What?

261
00:19:48,837 --> 00:19:51,203
Take me in your arms!

262
00:20:05,420 --> 00:20:09,117
My fiancée and I need a room!

263
00:20:09,591 --> 00:20:11,422
Cheap? Or best?

264
00:20:11,627 --> 00:20:12,252
What?

265
00:20:12,461 --> 00:20:17,125
Room! Full night, half night,
half hour, five minutes?

266
00:20:19,368 --> 00:20:20,596
1/2 hour! Cheap room!

267
00:20:22,037 --> 00:20:22,662
4th floor

268
00:20:22,871 --> 00:20:23,496
Thank you

269
00:20:32,881 --> 00:20:35,907
Girl's just want to have fun...

270
00:20:41,556 --> 00:20:52,364
Let's swing, let's dance
Let's sing, let's prance!

271
00:20:53,468 --> 00:20:54,935
Come here you!

272
00:21:10,485 --> 00:21:11,076
Hello!

273
00:21:11,420 --> 00:21:12,182
Who's this?

274
00:21:12,587 --> 00:21:13,849
This is Neal!
Who's this?

275
00:21:14,056 --> 00:21:15,921
Where's the girl
who the phone belongs to?

276
00:21:16,591 --> 00:21:19,788
She's kind of sleeping, who's this?

277
00:21:19,995 --> 00:21:20,791
Where?

278
00:21:21,530 --> 00:21:22,724
Thorny Rhino, who's this?

279
00:21:22,931 --> 00:21:23,556
What?

280
00:21:24,166 --> 00:21:31,197
The Thorny Rhino in down town...
who's this? Hello? Hello?

281
00:21:33,809 --> 00:21:34,503
Strange!

282
00:22:31,266 --> 00:22:32,028
Freeze.

283
00:22:48,316 --> 00:22:50,477
All right so she's
not pressing charges.

284
00:22:50,719 --> 00:22:53,210
You're free to go.
But stay out of trouble,

285
00:22:53,422 --> 00:22:54,889
And stay out of the Thorny Rhino!

286
00:22:55,090 --> 00:22:56,250
I'm not here to cause any trouble.

287
00:22:56,458 --> 00:22:59,018
I'm just... here to see the sights.

288
00:23:21,583 --> 00:23:26,213
Weird! Ok, you bad little thing you!

289
00:23:32,227 --> 00:23:33,694
I know what you're looking at.

290
00:23:35,330 --> 00:23:36,228
I'm sorry.

291
00:23:36,631 --> 00:23:39,122
Oh no, it's ok, people look
at them all the time.

292
00:23:40,502 --> 00:23:41,196
They do?

293
00:23:41,870 --> 00:23:44,100
Well Yeah!
They think they're cute.

294
00:23:44,506 --> 00:23:45,404
What do you think?

295
00:23:46,775 --> 00:23:48,766
Ah... they are really nice!

296
00:23:49,177 --> 00:23:50,474
Do you want to know their names?

297
00:23:51,680 --> 00:23:54,444
Oh my God, they have names?

298
00:23:54,883 --> 00:23:56,817
Ya sure, I would love to
know their names.

299
00:23:57,018 --> 00:23:59,987
Ok, this one is Teeni
and this one is Beenie.

300
00:24:00,188 --> 00:24:02,019
I am trying to help save the whales...

301
00:24:02,557 --> 00:24:04,320
...and Teeni and Beenie
are my whales.

302
00:24:04,526 --> 00:24:07,654
Oh, you know what?

303
00:24:08,196 --> 00:24:11,222
I spent last summer in
Africa doing the same thing.

304
00:24:11,433 --> 00:24:12,457
Trying to save the whales.

305
00:24:12,667 --> 00:24:14,032
Really? - Yes.

306
00:24:14,369 --> 00:24:15,165
Wow!

307
00:24:16,872 --> 00:24:19,500
Ok, there are no whales in Africa.

308
00:24:20,509 --> 00:24:23,410
I know... I couldn't save them.

309
00:24:23,645 --> 00:24:27,103
Oh no! I'm so sorry,
you poor baby.

310
00:24:28,150 --> 00:24:29,913
I know this really great place.

311
00:24:30,118 --> 00:24:32,985
You can actually view the
whales in their natural habitat...

312
00:24:33,188 --> 00:24:34,212
...do you want to come?
- Yes.

313
00:24:34,422 --> 00:24:35,218
Really? - Yes.

314
00:24:35,423 --> 00:24:36,685
Ok, come on let's go
- Let's go.

315
00:24:37,726 --> 00:24:40,024
You can see the whales if
we swim just past that island.

316
00:24:40,228 --> 00:24:43,561
Oh! And the water... it's going to be
little bit cold but don't worry.

317
00:24:44,966 --> 00:24:47,332
Once you jump in your body heat
is going to heat it up.

318
00:24:47,536 --> 00:24:48,798
It makes it nice and hot.

319
00:24:53,108 --> 00:24:56,407
I can't believe it, it's been so long
since I've brought anyone out here.

320
00:24:56,611 --> 00:24:57,305
Are you ready. - Yes.

321
00:24:57,512 --> 00:24:58,536
Are you excited? - Totally.

322
00:24:58,747 --> 00:25:00,009
I'm so excited.

323
00:25:17,832 --> 00:25:18,924
Aren't you coming in?

324
00:25:29,611 --> 00:25:31,476
Hello? - Is this Neal?

325
00:25:31,680 --> 00:25:32,305
Yes.

326
00:25:32,514 --> 00:25:35,950
Are you the idiot who took me
to the hotel last night?

327
00:25:36,151 --> 00:25:37,550
Yes, I mean no.

328
00:25:37,752 --> 00:25:40,687
What? Did you take me to the
Thorny Rhino or not?

329
00:25:40,889 --> 00:25:42,015
Yes! But, but but... I mean no

330
00:25:42,224 --> 00:25:46,820
You mean you were not the
naked guy with me in the hotel room?

331
00:25:47,028 --> 00:25:49,656
No! I mean yes! I mean no!

332
00:25:49,864 --> 00:25:53,027
Neal I'm feeling cold.
Aren't you coming in?

333
00:25:53,235 --> 00:25:58,571
Oh my God! Are you in hotel room
with a naked girl right now?

334
00:25:58,773 --> 00:26:01,867
Yes. I mean no.

335
00:26:02,077 --> 00:26:04,204
Eeww what a creep!

336
00:26:04,813 --> 00:26:08,146
You will meet me in half an hour
at the Bayview Bar!

337
00:26:08,350 --> 00:26:11,808
I want to know, what you were
doing with me last night.

338
00:26:12,020 --> 00:26:15,046
I haven't told the police
to take any action yet...

339
00:26:15,257 --> 00:26:20,854
...but if you don't show up,
I will personally come and cut off your...

340
00:26:22,864 --> 00:26:23,728
I'll be there.

341
00:26:26,334 --> 00:26:27,266
May I help you?

342
00:26:29,971 --> 00:26:30,665
You're fired!

343
00:26:31,039 --> 00:26:32,267
You can't fire me. - Why not?

344
00:26:32,474 --> 00:26:33,532
Because I quit.

345
00:26:47,522 --> 00:26:48,750
Hi, I'm Neal.

346
00:26:50,392 --> 00:26:52,553
Ok... nothing happened last night,
it's a big misunderstanding!

347
00:26:52,761 --> 00:26:54,752
In fact I was on a date,
and you were drunk...

348
00:26:54,963 --> 00:26:56,294
...and you came on to me and...

349
00:26:57,832 --> 00:26:58,491
What?

350
00:26:58,833 --> 00:27:01,631
I went to the hotel with you?
- Yes.

351
00:27:02,270 --> 00:27:03,669
How drunk was I?

352
00:27:05,540 --> 00:27:06,302
What do you mean?

353
00:27:06,775 --> 00:27:09,744
Never mind, why did you
take me to a hotel?

354
00:27:09,944 --> 00:27:11,969
Because you told me
to take you home!

355
00:27:12,180 --> 00:27:14,375
I said home, not the Thorny Rhino!
And if my friend...

356
00:27:14,582 --> 00:27:17,312
...hadn't called last night,
God knows what would have happened!

357
00:27:17,519 --> 00:27:19,350
But nothing happened!
- I know!

358
00:27:19,554 --> 00:27:20,953
Good. Then I'm glad
this is all cleared up.

359
00:27:21,156 --> 00:27:23,647
I'm out of here! - No, sit!

360
00:27:26,828 --> 00:27:31,788
There's one thing I can't understand.
Why were you naked?

361
00:27:32,000 --> 00:27:33,991
Did I tell you to take off your clothes?

362
00:27:34,202 --> 00:27:36,033
Yes, I mean no.

363
00:27:36,237 --> 00:27:41,197
Look I'm going to count to ten,
and if you don't tell me...

364
00:27:41,409 --> 00:27:43,775
...what you were doing with me
in the hotel room...

365
00:27:43,978 --> 00:27:50,383
...I will scream rape!
You don't know me, I will do it! One...

366
00:27:51,519 --> 00:27:52,076
Two

367
00:27:53,655 --> 00:27:55,088
3-4-5-6-7-8-9-10

368
00:27:55,190 --> 00:27:56,350
Ok look, I went for a shower
and when I came out...

369
00:27:56,558 --> 00:27:58,583
...I saw that the towels were
placed next to you. - Why?

370
00:27:59,127 --> 00:28:00,958
Because the hotel staff must
have put them there.

371
00:28:01,162 --> 00:28:03,392
No stupid,
why did you go for a shower?

372
00:28:03,598 --> 00:28:05,998
Because I felt like it!
I don't believe this!

373
00:28:06,201 --> 00:28:08,999
Do you really think I want to be
anywhere near a desperate, alcoholic...

374
00:28:09,204 --> 00:28:14,141
...crazy, stupid, dumb bimbo,
who thinks that she can get a date...

375
00:28:14,342 --> 00:28:16,867
...by saying "give me a corkscrew?"
Dude!

376
00:28:23,284 --> 00:28:28,847
Oh my God! I'm sorry!
I didn't mean to...

377
00:28:29,457 --> 00:28:35,020
My boyfriend left me...
he dumped me!

378
00:28:37,065 --> 00:28:37,793
I should go.

379
00:28:37,999 --> 00:28:39,899
Do you know why he left me?

380
00:28:40,101 --> 00:28:41,830
No, but you're going to tell me?

381
00:28:42,036 --> 00:28:43,731
Even I don't know!

382
00:28:44,439 --> 00:28:48,739
I miss him. I hate him. Bastard!

383
00:28:48,977 --> 00:28:54,313
But I don't know why,
I miss being in love.

384
00:28:56,818 --> 00:28:59,150
But it's over.

385
00:29:07,061 --> 00:29:11,589
I know it must be tough, but by drinking
he's not going to come back!

386
00:29:24,078 --> 00:29:27,047
Oh! No wonder your
boyfriend left you.

387
00:29:27,415 --> 00:29:31,511
Nikita Bakshi.
Ah Guiness Towers please.

388
00:29:42,664 --> 00:29:44,962
Hey Kristy! - Hey.

389
00:29:45,200 --> 00:29:47,259
I've really missed you.
Where have you been?

390
00:29:47,469 --> 00:29:49,300
I've been trying to reach you,
but I don't have your number.

391
00:29:49,504 --> 00:29:51,369
Oh do you? Do you want it?

392
00:29:51,573 --> 00:29:52,369
Ya Great

393
00:29:52,574 --> 00:29:53,768
It's 555

394
00:29:54,476 --> 00:29:57,843
Ya 555... 555 Ya

395
00:29:58,780 --> 00:30:01,544
Eew, you are gross

396
00:30:02,884 --> 00:30:03,680
Oh that.

397
00:30:03,885 --> 00:30:05,182
Cab driver please go.

398
00:30:05,386 --> 00:30:07,786
Oh no no no, please no,
please you were saying 555

399
00:30:07,989 --> 00:30:08,455
Just go.

400
00:30:08,656 --> 00:30:09,850
Don't go, don't go,
don't go, don't go...

401
00:30:36,451 --> 00:30:39,181
My doggy's name is Bimbo.

402
00:30:41,256 --> 00:30:42,018
Bimbo...

403
00:30:46,427 --> 00:30:48,657
Cool chick pad.

404
00:30:58,072 --> 00:30:59,937
Dear Mom and Dad.

405
00:31:03,945 --> 00:31:05,572
My doggy's name is...

406
00:31:05,780 --> 00:31:07,145
I know... Bimbo!

407
00:31:08,850 --> 00:31:10,681
Good Morning Vancouver!

408
00:31:10,885 --> 00:31:12,443
We've got some
showers this morning but...

409
00:31:12,654 --> 00:31:14,952
...I promise you it's going
to be a bright sunny day.

410
00:31:43,651 --> 00:31:44,413
Excuse me

411
00:31:44,953 --> 00:31:46,215
Are you connected?

412
00:31:46,421 --> 00:31:46,978
Yes.

413
00:31:47,255 --> 00:31:49,450
I want to check my email, may I?

414
00:31:49,657 --> 00:31:50,316
Sure

415
00:31:50,892 --> 00:31:52,587
Hi, I'm Karen.

416
00:31:54,462 --> 00:31:55,952
Hi, I'm Neal.

417
00:31:56,564 --> 00:31:58,896
Hi Neal. Nice to meet you.

418
00:31:59,300 --> 00:32:01,860
You really like to dress up
for coffee, don't you?

419
00:32:02,570 --> 00:32:04,265
I've just run away from a wedding!

420
00:32:04,672 --> 00:32:05,764
Poor groom!

421
00:32:06,975 --> 00:32:09,910
Not mine silly,
it wasn't my wedding!

422
00:32:12,680 --> 00:32:14,614
Interesting pictures...

423
00:32:16,084 --> 00:32:19,053
Oh! That! Actually,
I met her at a party...

424
00:32:19,253 --> 00:32:22,245
...I spoke to her for a few minutes and
she just emailed me her photos

425
00:32:22,457 --> 00:32:24,550
Oh! It must be difficult no?

426
00:32:24,759 --> 00:32:26,192
Being so popular with the girls.

427
00:32:26,394 --> 00:32:27,122
What to do?!

428
00:32:27,462 --> 00:32:30,329
Ever since I've come to Vancouver,
girls just can't get enough of me!

429
00:32:31,799 --> 00:32:34,563
You're new to Vancouver? - Yes.

430
00:32:34,936 --> 00:32:38,269
I know a girl who's exactly your type.

431
00:32:39,040 --> 00:32:40,701
Would you like her number?

432
00:32:41,175 --> 00:32:42,972
Sure! Why not?

433
00:32:43,177 --> 00:32:43,939
Great!

434
00:32:49,183 --> 00:32:50,275
Are you looking for a pen?

435
00:32:54,055 --> 00:32:55,545
Mmmmm what's that?

436
00:32:56,090 --> 00:32:58,354
Me. - Me smells nice.

437
00:32:59,961 --> 00:33:01,553
Call her. She's awesome.

438
00:33:05,967 --> 00:33:06,934
Excuse me. - Yes.

439
00:33:07,135 --> 00:33:08,227
Read my chest. - What?

440
00:33:08,436 --> 00:33:09,562
Read my chest dude

441
00:33:09,771 --> 00:33:12,831
Absolutely honey! 555-2072

442
00:33:13,207 --> 00:33:13,866
Thank you

443
00:33:14,308 --> 00:33:15,707
Oh I liked him.

444
00:33:17,779 --> 00:33:18,677
Hi Neal.

445
00:33:19,047 --> 00:33:19,945
Hi awesome!

446
00:33:20,148 --> 00:33:24,016
We'll meet in the evening at seven,
Pacific Center. Don't be late.

447
00:33:39,400 --> 00:33:41,265
Oh I just love tennis.

448
00:33:41,736 --> 00:33:42,634
Want to play?

449
00:33:43,004 --> 00:33:45,837
No! It's more fun watching.

450
00:33:46,708 --> 00:33:49,575
You know, the power,
the swing, the energy...

451
00:33:49,777 --> 00:33:51,506
And the mini skirts?

452
00:33:52,080 --> 00:33:54,412
Actually, it's only the mini skirts.

453
00:33:57,585 --> 00:33:58,176
Shall we go?

454
00:33:59,120 --> 00:34:00,144
Aren't you going to have a shower?

455
00:34:00,354 --> 00:34:03,016
Why? You don't like me
all hot and sweaty? Huh?

456
00:34:03,224 --> 00:34:04,418
No I thought I would join you.

457
00:34:06,828 --> 00:34:08,420
Hey Nikki. Hi!

458
00:34:08,629 --> 00:34:10,062
I want you to meet someone special.

459
00:34:10,264 --> 00:34:13,028
My new instructor Nikki.
She's just joined us...

460
00:34:13,234 --> 00:34:16,169
...and she plays very well
Come on!

461
00:34:16,404 --> 00:34:17,462
Neal this is Nikki!

462
00:34:18,473 --> 00:34:20,031
Nikki! Hi!

463
00:34:20,241 --> 00:34:21,538
Hi! I'm Nicole!

464
00:34:21,743 --> 00:34:25,008
Nicole... Nikki!
It's so nice to meet you!

465
00:34:25,213 --> 00:34:26,043
It's so nice to meet you too!

466
00:34:26,247 --> 00:34:27,874
Ah, may I? - Yes.

467
00:34:29,250 --> 00:34:33,778
Nikki, Nikki, Nikki, Nikki, Nikki...

468
00:34:34,188 --> 00:34:34,984
Shall we go?

469
00:34:39,360 --> 00:34:40,019
Nikki.

470
00:34:40,495 --> 00:34:42,463
You know, sometimes I feel...

471
00:34:42,663 --> 00:34:44,893
I should leave professional law
and play tennis.

472
00:34:45,099 --> 00:34:50,469
I just love the sport! The energy,
the physical exercise and the power!

473
00:34:50,671 --> 00:34:52,468
I'm good at it you know, and I...

474
00:34:53,241 --> 00:34:54,071
What?

475
00:34:54,675 --> 00:34:55,403
Nothing!

476
00:34:56,410 --> 00:34:59,208
Come on, then why are you
smiling like that?

477
00:35:00,414 --> 00:35:02,575
I just played strip poker
with you, in my mind...

478
00:35:02,784 --> 00:35:03,751
...and you lost!

479
00:35:05,853 --> 00:35:10,119
Impossible!
That can't happen, I never lose.

480
00:35:10,825 --> 00:35:11,587
Never?

481
00:35:13,294 --> 00:35:15,819
I only lose when I want to lose!

482
00:35:16,030 --> 00:35:17,622
I like to be in control.

483
00:35:18,399 --> 00:35:21,232
So what makes you lose control?

484
00:35:23,471 --> 00:35:24,096
You.

485
00:35:53,734 --> 00:35:58,262
Neal? It's me Nikki! Hi!

486
00:35:58,639 --> 00:36:00,197
I've been looking all over for you!

487
00:36:00,408 --> 00:36:03,036
You know that night
when you helped me...

488
00:36:03,244 --> 00:36:05,542
...at the restaurant,
I felt like I found a true friend...

489
00:36:05,746 --> 00:36:08,044
...we really bonded!

490
00:36:08,249 --> 00:36:09,216
Nikki! - Yes?

491
00:36:09,884 --> 00:36:11,317
What are you doing here?

492
00:36:11,719 --> 00:36:14,051
Oh, It's my new job.
You know...

493
00:36:14,255 --> 00:36:15,187
No, I don't want to know,
I don't want to!

494
00:36:15,389 --> 00:36:17,687
Can't you see that
I'm doing someone... something?

495
00:36:17,959 --> 00:36:19,392
What's your problem?
Why do you always...

496
00:36:19,594 --> 00:36:20,060
...show up at the wrong place?

497
00:36:20,261 --> 00:36:22,058
Why do you always come to the
wrong place at the wrong time?

498
00:36:22,263 --> 00:36:23,491
In 21 days I'm getting
married and...

499
00:36:23,698 --> 00:36:25,461
...I've only come to Vancouver
to get some action.

500
00:36:25,666 --> 00:36:27,998
And this chick was the
easiest action ever!

501
00:36:29,437 --> 00:36:30,301
I didn't mean that.

502
00:36:42,817 --> 00:36:44,148
I could get you some action.

503
00:36:44,352 --> 00:36:46,616
Oh, you also supply girls?

504
00:36:47,388 --> 00:36:49,049
I can take you to a place where you...

505
00:36:49,257 --> 00:36:50,986
...will get as much action as you want.

506
00:36:51,192 --> 00:36:52,784
That's why I came to Vancouver

507
00:36:52,994 --> 00:36:53,824
That's your mistake!

508
00:36:54,028 --> 00:36:56,121
The only mistake I made
was meeting you!

509
00:36:56,330 --> 00:36:58,491
Meeting me is the
best mistake of your life!

510
00:36:58,699 --> 00:37:00,132
Oh really? How?

511
00:37:00,334 --> 00:37:02,199
I can take you to Whistler.

512
00:37:02,403 --> 00:37:05,338
Wow Whistler yeh!
What happens there?

513
00:37:05,473 --> 00:37:07,373
Wouldn't you like to know?

514
00:37:09,243 --> 00:37:10,540
Nikki! You owe me this.

515
00:37:10,845 --> 00:37:13,143
Dude, Whistler is babe heaven.

516
00:37:13,447 --> 00:37:17,008
All the beautiful girls of the
world live there. Jennifer Lopez?

517
00:37:17,218 --> 00:37:17,809
Yeah?

518
00:37:18,953 --> 00:37:19,544
What?

519
00:37:20,855 --> 00:37:21,344
Yes.

520
00:37:24,592 --> 00:37:25,217
No way!

521
00:37:25,426 --> 00:37:28,623
Ya way! All the boys go there...

522
00:37:28,863 --> 00:37:31,127
...whenever they want to
have a good time!

523
00:37:31,332 --> 00:37:33,766
I didn't know that.
- I can see that

524
00:37:34,235 --> 00:37:35,133
Very funny!

525
00:37:36,070 --> 00:37:37,935
I can take you there.

526
00:37:38,406 --> 00:37:41,398
Why? Why would you
take me there?

527
00:37:42,076 --> 00:37:44,135
Because I feel sorry for you.

528
00:37:44,345 --> 00:37:46,472
You're getting married and all...

529
00:37:47,281 --> 00:37:50,409
So you'll take me to Whistler
because you feel bad for me?

530
00:37:50,918 --> 00:37:52,442
I'm a nice girl.

531
00:37:55,389 --> 00:37:57,016
You're not nice, you're crazy.

532
00:37:57,224 --> 00:37:59,749
Yeah! I'm a crazy nice girl...

533
00:38:00,094 --> 00:38:02,062
...who's going to Whistler
to find a new job.

534
00:38:02,463 --> 00:38:03,259
And this job?

535
00:38:03,597 --> 00:38:04,757
I quit.

536
00:38:12,306 --> 00:38:18,541
33, intelligent, lawyer, divorced
and disturbed, hates men!

537
00:38:19,180 --> 00:38:20,078
I've got no chance with her.

538
00:38:20,581 --> 00:38:21,775
What are you doing?

539
00:38:25,419 --> 00:38:27,478
Do you see that girl? - Yes.

540
00:38:27,688 --> 00:38:28,848
What do you think she does?

541
00:38:29,056 --> 00:38:31,024
I don't know. - Go on, guess!

542
00:38:32,026 --> 00:38:34,426
Ok she's probably a social worker...

543
00:38:34,762 --> 00:38:37,560
...who works in an orphanage.

544
00:38:37,865 --> 00:38:44,464
Plays with kids. She looks kind gentle,
loving and very sweet.

545
00:38:44,672 --> 00:38:47,698
No! Stripper! - No!

546
00:38:47,908 --> 00:38:48,499
Yes.

547
00:38:48,709 --> 00:38:50,074
Really? - Yes.

548
00:38:50,277 --> 00:38:53,178
Just by looking at a girl
you can tell what she does?

549
00:38:53,381 --> 00:38:57,112
Not only that, I can also predict
if she will do... you know...

550
00:38:58,352 --> 00:38:59,649
Really? - Yes.

551
00:39:00,321 --> 00:39:01,515
Ok, Do me!

552
00:39:03,557 --> 00:39:04,546
Here? Now?

553
00:39:04,759 --> 00:39:07,159
No! Stupid! Analyze me.

554
00:39:07,661 --> 00:39:11,961
Oh, ok. Rich parents! Only child!

555
00:39:12,166 --> 00:39:13,895
Always protected by your parents.

556
00:39:14,101 --> 00:39:15,500
You always did what you
wanted because...

557
00:39:15,703 --> 00:39:17,967
...you know your parents are always
there to look after you.

558
00:39:18,172 --> 00:39:20,402
But now you feel you can't do
anything on your own.

559
00:39:20,608 --> 00:39:21,905
You've become too dependent.

560
00:39:22,143 --> 00:39:24,703
That's why you've asked
your parents for a year's...

561
00:39:24,912 --> 00:39:27,472
...time alone in the city to prove that
you are independent...

562
00:39:27,681 --> 00:39:28,705
...you can take care of yourself, and

563
00:39:28,916 --> 00:39:31,544
you can take your own decisions
because you're a grown up now!

564
00:39:33,721 --> 00:39:37,282
Oh my God, you got all that
just by looking at me?

565
00:39:37,725 --> 00:39:41,354
No, I read the email you
wrote to your parents.

566
00:39:41,562 --> 00:39:42,051
What?

567
00:39:42,263 --> 00:39:43,753
Oh ya, and you're a virgin

568
00:39:43,964 --> 00:39:49,800
I am! No I am not! I...
I am not a virgin

569
00:39:50,004 --> 00:39:52,404
Refusing to admit it!
Denial! First sign!

570
00:39:53,107 --> 00:39:55,132
I'm so not a virgin!

571
00:39:55,342 --> 00:39:58,539
Second sign - body language.
Nobody should come near me!

572
00:39:59,213 --> 00:40:01,511
You don't know a thing,
I'm not a virgin.

573
00:40:01,715 --> 00:40:04,809
I have done it... I mean...
I've done it lots of times.

574
00:40:05,019 --> 00:40:05,951
Really? - Yes.

575
00:40:06,153 --> 00:40:07,381
What does it feel like? - Kickass!

576
00:40:07,588 --> 00:40:08,486
Kickass! - Yes.

577
00:40:08,689 --> 00:40:09,280
Haven't done it, huh?

578
00:40:09,490 --> 00:40:11,958
No. But I choose not to.

579
00:40:13,527 --> 00:40:15,654
That's why your boyfriend
chose to dump you.

580
00:40:15,863 --> 00:40:17,296
That's none of your business.

581
00:40:17,498 --> 00:40:18,863
What do you think of yourself?

582
00:40:19,066 --> 00:40:22,058
You think by reading
one email you know me?

583
00:40:22,269 --> 00:40:23,429
You don't know a thing!

584
00:40:23,637 --> 00:40:27,300
Hey, hey, hey! There is no need to get
angry, it's your decision. Live with it!

585
00:40:27,508 --> 00:40:28,440
I am living with it. - Good.

586
00:40:28,642 --> 00:40:31,110
I don't even know if
I did the right thing or not?

587
00:40:31,312 --> 00:40:34,110
It's so confusing. Sometimes I think
I should have with Trish...

588
00:40:34,315 --> 00:40:35,873
You know, I should have
just done it with him.

589
00:40:36,083 --> 00:40:37,675
Maybe he was the special one.

590
00:40:37,885 --> 00:40:41,082
Ah the special one! Part of this
complete nutritious breakfast!

591
00:40:41,288 --> 00:40:42,846
Go ahead, make fun of me!

592
00:40:43,057 --> 00:40:45,423
No, I'm not going to.

593
00:40:47,061 --> 00:40:48,085
You did the right thing.

594
00:40:49,330 --> 00:40:51,264
The first time should be
with someone special.

595
00:40:52,233 --> 00:40:54,633
Do you know why? - Why?

596
00:40:55,636 --> 00:40:57,661
Because you never forget your 'first time'.

597
00:40:58,172 --> 00:41:00,402
And if the first time is with an idiot...

598
00:41:01,208 --> 00:41:03,438
...you have to remember that idiot
for the rest of your life.

599
00:41:04,712 --> 00:41:06,373
And you? - What about me?

600
00:41:06,714 --> 00:41:08,272
Who was your idiot?

601
00:41:08,682 --> 00:41:09,740
Excuse me?

602
00:41:10,017 --> 00:41:12,178
Your first time? Was it special?

603
00:41:12,386 --> 00:41:13,444
Why would I tell you?

604
00:41:13,654 --> 00:41:15,281
Why? Who was she?

605
00:41:15,723 --> 00:41:17,350
I'm not going to tell you.

606
00:41:18,425 --> 00:41:22,259
I know you paid for it!
You must have given money!

607
00:41:22,596 --> 00:41:24,257
No I did not! - Did too.

608
00:41:24,465 --> 00:41:29,926
Did not! - Did too.

609
00:41:32,606 --> 00:41:33,334
Did not.

610
00:41:51,792 --> 00:41:59,358
"Four was the age when
I fell in love for the first time."

611
00:42:00,701 --> 00:42:09,234
"We glanced at each other
and fell in a rhyme."

612
00:42:09,443 --> 00:42:13,573
"I'm cool now as I was then."

613
00:42:13,914 --> 00:42:19,352
"I'm supercool now as I was then."

614
00:42:20,688 --> 00:42:23,282
"Hey, I'm the Neal I'm the man."

615
00:42:23,490 --> 00:42:25,822
"Rockstar! Superstar!"

616
00:42:39,873 --> 00:42:42,899
"Ok, so, what about you?
What's your story girl?"

617
00:42:43,110 --> 00:42:51,779
"I just gave my heart away,
without knowing it began to sway."

618
00:42:53,287 --> 00:43:01,058
"I was 9 when I saw him on TV,
George Michael was his name."

619
00:43:01,262 --> 00:43:03,025
"Oh that singer? He's gay!"

620
00:43:03,230 --> 00:43:03,696
"Did you know?"

621
00:43:03,897 --> 00:43:04,921
"He swings the other way?"

622
00:43:06,066 --> 00:43:08,762
"I was very young, and anyways..."

623
00:43:08,969 --> 00:43:13,406
..."I knew that riding a horse
my prince would come..."

624
00:43:13,607 --> 00:43:18,772
"...and softly in my ears
he would hum."

625
00:43:20,080 --> 00:43:22,810
"Nikki Bakshi, sweet n sexy."

626
00:43:23,017 --> 00:43:25,383
"Full on rockin', Hot n Happenin'."

627
00:43:48,542 --> 00:43:51,978
"2 ones are 2. 2 twos are 4."

628
00:43:52,780 --> 00:43:56,841
"When I used to calculate,
I loved her more."

629
00:43:57,351 --> 00:44:05,520
"She taught Algebra in school, and
in my dreams she made me drool."

630
00:44:05,659 --> 00:44:08,389
"What?! You had the
hots for your teacher... Weirdo!!"

631
00:44:08,562 --> 00:44:12,931
"Every girl in the world is my fan..."

632
00:44:13,133 --> 00:44:17,729
"Non-stop loving is
the story of this man."

633
00:44:17,938 --> 00:44:20,031
"I'm the Neal. I'm the man."

634
00:44:20,240 --> 00:44:22,470
"Rockstar! Superstar!"

635
00:44:36,256 --> 00:44:37,223
"Thirteen, fourteen."

636
00:44:37,424 --> 00:44:39,392
"Boys were so boring."

637
00:44:40,661 --> 00:44:41,787
"Fifteen, sixteen."

638
00:44:41,995 --> 00:44:43,189
"You were boring?"

639
00:44:43,397 --> 00:44:45,058
"Oh, grow up!"

640
00:44:45,399 --> 00:44:49,096
"For my glimpse they
used to stand in a line."

641
00:44:49,937 --> 00:44:53,532
"For my love they all pined."

642
00:44:54,241 --> 00:44:58,644
"In my dreams my sweetheart stays."

643
00:44:58,846 --> 00:45:03,783
"He comes to me at night and says."

644
00:45:05,352 --> 00:45:06,842
"Nikki Bakshi."

645
00:45:07,054 --> 00:45:08,021
"Sweet n sexy."

646
00:45:08,222 --> 00:45:09,280
"Full on rockin."

647
00:45:09,490 --> 00:45:10,616
"Hot n Happenin."

648
00:45:33,414 --> 00:45:37,248
"If we had met then."

649
00:45:37,718 --> 00:45:42,519
"We could have hooked up then."

650
00:45:51,665 --> 00:45:55,431
"We would never work."

651
00:45:56,103 --> 00:45:59,800
"Our pairing doesn't work."

652
00:46:00,007 --> 00:46:04,910
"I'm cool now as I was then."

653
00:46:05,112 --> 00:46:10,311
"I'm supercool now as I was then."

654
00:46:10,517 --> 00:46:12,041
"I know, I know."

655
00:46:12,319 --> 00:46:13,183
"You're the Neal."

656
00:46:13,387 --> 00:46:14,479
"You're the man."

657
00:46:14,688 --> 00:46:15,484
"Rockstar!"

658
00:46:15,689 --> 00:46:16,883
"Superstar!"

659
00:46:21,462 --> 00:46:22,394
"Nikki Bakshi."

660
00:46:22,596 --> 00:46:23,494
"Sweet n sexy."

661
00:46:23,697 --> 00:46:24,721
"Full on rockin."

662
00:46:24,932 --> 00:46:26,297
"Hot n Happenin."

663
00:46:50,057 --> 00:46:53,754
Stupid... Idiot... Jerk...
Slime - ball... Cockroach.

664
00:46:53,894 --> 00:46:54,588
Why have we stopped?

665
00:46:54,728 --> 00:46:56,696
What does he think of himself?
- Who?

666
00:46:56,797 --> 00:46:58,355
Him! My boyfriend!

667
00:47:00,100 --> 00:47:01,727
That truck driver is your boyfriend?

668
00:47:01,969 --> 00:47:06,429
Not him! Him!

669
00:47:06,640 --> 00:47:07,607
He's kind of big.

670
00:47:08,909 --> 00:47:09,876
What does he think he is?

671
00:47:10,077 --> 00:47:11,601
Just because his face is
on every hoarding, and...

672
00:47:11,812 --> 00:47:14,303
...every box of cornflakes
he thinks he can dump me?

673
00:47:14,515 --> 00:47:19,475
He will never get a girl like me
Never! Understand!

674
00:47:19,720 --> 00:47:20,243
That's true.

675
00:47:20,454 --> 00:47:23,218
He's not dumped me,
he's dumped true love.

676
00:47:23,423 --> 00:47:25,050
You and Amanda can go to hell.

677
00:47:25,259 --> 00:47:26,226
Who's Amanda?

678
00:47:26,493 --> 00:47:29,189
A witch who Trish left me for.

679
00:47:30,230 --> 00:47:31,026
Good job!

680
00:47:31,665 --> 00:47:32,962
What didn't I do for him?

681
00:47:33,166 --> 00:47:35,191
I even joined cookery classes for him.

682
00:47:35,402 --> 00:47:35,868
How sweet.

683
00:47:36,069 --> 00:47:37,730
Ok, so I almost killed him...

684
00:47:37,938 --> 00:47:40,236
But did I tell him
to be allergic to onions?

685
00:47:40,440 --> 00:47:42,806
I mean... who's allergic to onions?

686
00:47:43,377 --> 00:47:44,674
I'm allergic to prawns.

687
00:47:45,646 --> 00:47:49,013
It's not about you,
it's about me.

688
00:47:56,823 --> 00:47:58,518
I'm so over him.

689
00:47:58,725 --> 00:47:59,248
Good for you!

690
00:47:59,626 --> 00:48:01,992
I've forgotten Trish completely!

691
00:48:02,195 --> 00:48:04,823
Good.
- If anyone even asks me about Trish...

692
00:48:05,032 --> 00:48:08,433
...I will say 'Trish... who? '
- Very good.

693
00:48:08,702 --> 00:48:11,364
God! It feels so good.
- Good.

694
00:48:12,172 --> 00:48:15,164
Neal, hold me. - What?

695
00:48:15,642 --> 00:48:18,839
Take me in your arms,
just hold me!

696
00:48:19,379 --> 00:48:21,609
Nikki, I know you're recovering...

697
00:48:21,815 --> 00:48:22,611
...from this Trish thing,
but I don't think you and I...

698
00:48:22,816 --> 00:48:27,480
Neal, I only want you to...
just hold me.

699
00:48:27,688 --> 00:48:29,553
Ok Nikki I think you need to relax...

700
00:48:29,890 --> 00:48:32,586
What part of 'hold me'
don't you understand asshole?

701
00:48:32,793 --> 00:48:35,694
I don't want to hold you!
Everyone is watching...

702
00:48:39,466 --> 00:48:42,333
Hey! Isn't that your boyfriend Trish?

703
00:48:42,536 --> 00:48:44,094
Who? Where?

704
00:48:44,304 --> 00:48:44,861
There.

705
00:48:50,711 --> 00:48:53,646
You horrible, evil,
manipulative little...

706
00:48:53,847 --> 00:48:55,041
I can explain.

707
00:48:55,382 --> 00:48:58,249
You brought me to Whistler for this?
To make your boyfriend jealous?

708
00:48:58,452 --> 00:49:00,647
I can't believe I fell for this!

709
00:49:01,355 --> 00:49:02,481
Actually it was quite easy.

710
00:49:02,689 --> 00:49:05,283
And now since you're here,
just hold me.

711
00:49:05,492 --> 00:49:08,825
Poor guy doesn't have a clue,
he doesn't know what's going to hit him!

712
00:49:09,029 --> 00:49:11,497
You know what,
I'm going to tell him everything.

713
00:49:12,032 --> 00:49:13,829
I'm going to tell him to run for his life. - No.

714
00:49:14,034 --> 00:49:17,993
I'm telling every guy in this world
to stay away from you! Trish...

715
00:49:45,732 --> 00:49:47,529
Why are you behaving like a girl?

716
00:49:47,734 --> 00:49:48,860
You used me.

717
00:49:49,236 --> 00:49:50,703
I only kissed you

718
00:49:50,904 --> 00:49:52,371
Only? You call that only?

719
00:49:52,572 --> 00:49:54,631
Before kissing something needs
to exist between people.

720
00:49:54,841 --> 00:49:55,705
There needs to be some
sort of relationship.

721
00:49:55,909 --> 00:49:58,377
A kiss is the meeting of
two spirits, two souls, two minds.

722
00:49:59,079 --> 00:50:00,706
Oh for God sakes!
I didn't rape you!

723
00:50:00,914 --> 00:50:02,381
You did worse. You conned me.

724
00:50:02,582 --> 00:50:04,880
I needed your help.
- You should have just asked for it!

725
00:50:05,085 --> 00:50:07,053
Would you have helped me? - No

726
00:50:09,589 --> 00:50:10,214
Don't do that!

727
00:50:10,757 --> 00:50:11,815
What?

728
00:50:12,025 --> 00:50:14,050
Neeeeeeeal. Don't play cute
with me. It won't work.

729
00:50:14,261 --> 00:50:15,228
So what will?

730
00:50:15,429 --> 00:50:16,396
Nothing! Nothing will work!

731
00:50:16,763 --> 00:50:19,061
And what if I get you a girl?

732
00:50:19,933 --> 00:50:22,493
Excuse me? Did you say
what I think you just said?

733
00:50:23,103 --> 00:50:26,004
I'm the Neal!
I don't need your help,

734
00:50:26,206 --> 00:50:27,673
I can get any girl I want!

735
00:50:27,874 --> 00:50:30,638
Really? Then why did you
come to Whistler with me?

736
00:50:30,944 --> 00:50:36,246
I... I came to see the sights

737
00:50:36,450 --> 00:50:42,753
Aahh. Go ahead pick a girl!
Choose a girl of your choice!

738
00:50:43,290 --> 00:50:50,253
Fine. I can take a girl? That one!

739
00:50:50,864 --> 00:50:51,694
That one?

740
00:50:52,632 --> 00:50:53,929
Yeah! - Done.

741
00:51:14,888 --> 00:51:17,356
Neal, meet my friend Marie

742
00:51:18,959 --> 00:51:20,859
Nikki's been telling me all about you...

743
00:51:21,061 --> 00:51:21,857
Really now

744
00:51:22,062 --> 00:51:25,031
She's easy, you'll get some action!

745
00:51:26,066 --> 00:51:28,364
If what she says is true, then...

746
00:51:28,668 --> 00:51:29,293
Then?

747
00:51:29,503 --> 00:51:31,368
Then we must hang out!
Come by my work...

748
00:51:31,571 --> 00:51:33,368
...at the crab shack at 7,
and we'll get together

749
00:51:34,407 --> 00:51:34,873
Cool

750
00:51:39,412 --> 00:51:41,539
Stop drooling now, she's gone!

751
00:51:42,082 --> 00:51:43,208
What did you say to her?

752
00:51:43,416 --> 00:51:44,212
Do we have a deal?

753
00:51:44,417 --> 00:51:46,385
Deal! What do I have to do?

754
00:51:46,653 --> 00:51:48,211
You have to make me yours!

755
00:51:48,421 --> 00:51:49,718
Cool. Shall we get a room?

756
00:51:50,257 --> 00:51:53,385
Not like that stupid!
You have to win over my heart!

757
00:51:53,593 --> 00:51:56,221
You have to write poems
praising my beauty...

758
00:51:56,596 --> 00:52:01,226
...and then sing them for
me like songs of love.

759
00:52:01,434 --> 00:52:05,894
The air will be filled with their melody,
they will echo from the mountains...

760
00:52:06,106 --> 00:52:10,236
...rivers and the valleys and
everyone will hum your tunes!!

761
00:52:10,510 --> 00:52:15,743
And when you sing, the whole world
will know what true love means!

762
00:52:17,284 --> 00:52:21,243
Are you totally insane?
Who does these silly things?

763
00:52:36,069 --> 00:52:37,764
You expect me to do this?

764
00:52:38,638 --> 00:52:39,696
Don't be silly.

765
00:52:39,906 --> 00:52:43,433
You performing Amitabh Bachchan's songs?
Never! You have to do this.

766
00:52:55,889 --> 00:52:57,948
I want to make Trish jealous!

767
00:52:58,491 --> 00:53:00,618
I want make him beg!

768
00:53:01,161 --> 00:53:06,622
When he sees you making
a complete fool of your self,

769
00:53:06,833 --> 00:53:09,393
he will come running back to me.

770
00:53:09,669 --> 00:53:11,637
He'll beg me to come back to him.

771
00:53:11,838 --> 00:53:18,471
Men! They have small hearts,
small brains, and small... everything!

772
00:53:19,112 --> 00:53:24,573
Egocentric, possessive,
morons! Except you!

773
00:53:25,452 --> 00:53:28,319
Ok I... I'll do it, but on one condition.

774
00:53:28,521 --> 00:53:29,146
What?

775
00:53:30,457 --> 00:53:31,981
No more of that kissing stuff huh, please.

776
00:53:32,525 --> 00:53:35,494
Don't worry! Nobody kisses in Hindi films!

777
00:53:51,144 --> 00:53:55,012
"With the charming way you come
with the tunes that you hum"

778
00:53:55,215 --> 00:53:56,341
"And with the way you smile."

779
00:53:56,549 --> 00:53:59,177
"I'm in love."

780
00:54:01,821 --> 00:54:04,346
"When we kiss and make up."

781
00:54:04,557 --> 00:54:07,025
"I don't know for what reason."

782
00:54:07,227 --> 00:54:09,092
"I'm in love."

783
00:54:09,296 --> 00:54:14,359
"I've waited for ages."

784
00:54:14,567 --> 00:54:19,527
"O' my God, I'm in love."

785
00:54:19,739 --> 00:54:25,541
"O' my God, I'm in love."

786
00:54:25,912 --> 00:54:28,380
"With rejection, with acceptance"

787
00:54:28,581 --> 00:54:31,049
"And with your every nuance"

788
00:54:31,251 --> 00:54:34,049
"I'm in love"

789
00:54:36,589 --> 00:54:39,057
"Unknowingly and strangely,."

790
00:54:39,259 --> 00:54:41,727
"From now to eternity."

791
00:54:41,928 --> 00:54:43,793
"I'm in love."

792
00:54:43,997 --> 00:54:49,162
"I've waited for ages."

793
00:54:49,369 --> 00:54:54,397
"O' my God, I'm in love."

794
00:54:54,607 --> 00:55:00,739
"O' my God, I'm in love."

795
00:55:01,448 --> 00:55:03,575
"You're my dream,
my love my light."

796
00:55:04,217 --> 00:55:06,742
"I just wanna spend
my life with you."

797
00:55:06,953 --> 00:55:09,080
"You're the one that
makes me smile."

798
00:55:09,622 --> 00:55:12,090
"I just wanna spend
my life with you."

799
00:55:26,306 --> 00:55:32,211
"Now that you've filled my dreams."

800
00:55:32,412 --> 00:55:37,372
"I want stay in this trance forever!"

801
00:55:37,584 --> 00:55:39,882
"I'm here all around you."

802
00:55:40,086 --> 00:55:42,782
"I'm in your arms with you."

803
00:55:42,989 --> 00:55:47,949
"Believe me, I'm real!"

804
00:55:48,661 --> 00:55:51,129
"In the day or in the night."

805
00:55:51,331 --> 00:55:53,891
"...with everything that
keeps you within sight..."

806
00:55:54,100 --> 00:55:56,466
"...I'm in love"

807
00:55:59,339 --> 00:56:01,807
"In sunshine and in rain..."

808
00:56:02,008 --> 00:56:04,476
"...with our meeting time and again..."

809
00:56:04,677 --> 00:56:06,645
"...I'm in love"

810
00:56:06,846 --> 00:56:11,806
"I've waited for ages."

811
00:56:12,018 --> 00:56:17,149
"O' my God, I'm in love."

812
00:56:17,357 --> 00:56:23,318
"O' my God, I'm in love."

813
00:56:33,606 --> 00:56:44,380
"My darling let's go
chase the stars."

814
00:56:45,552 --> 00:56:47,520
"You're my dream,
my love, my light."

815
00:56:48,321 --> 00:56:50,687
"I just wanna spend
my life with you."

816
00:56:51,057 --> 00:56:53,525
"You're the one that
makes me smile."

817
00:56:53,726 --> 00:56:56,524
"I just wanna spend
my life with you."

818
00:57:00,133 --> 00:57:05,366
"The color of your eyes
is the color of the sky."

819
00:57:05,572 --> 00:57:10,874
"Let me be a cloud in them."

820
00:57:11,077 --> 00:57:16,037
"You've played with the stars,
the moon is your friend."

821
00:57:16,249 --> 00:57:21,710
"I'll be the cloud that engulfs you!"

822
00:57:22,021 --> 00:57:25,889
"With the charming way you come
with the tunes that you hum"

823
00:57:26,092 --> 00:57:27,320
"And with the way you smile."

824
00:57:27,527 --> 00:57:29,722
"I'm in love."

825
00:57:32,699 --> 00:57:35,327
"When we kiss and make up."

826
00:57:35,535 --> 00:57:37,901
"I don't know for what reason."

827
00:57:38,104 --> 00:57:40,129
"I'm in love."

828
00:57:40,340 --> 00:57:45,334
"I've waited for ages."

829
00:57:45,545 --> 00:57:50,573
"O' my God, I'm in love."

830
00:57:50,783 --> 00:57:56,016
"I'm in love, I'm in love."

831
00:57:56,222 --> 00:58:01,592
"I'm in love, I'm in love."

832
00:58:02,962 --> 00:58:05,430
"You're my dream,
my love, my light."

833
00:58:05,798 --> 00:58:08,426
"I just wanna spend
my life with you."

834
00:58:08,801 --> 00:58:11,429
"My life with you."

835
00:58:11,638 --> 00:58:20,273
"I just wanna spend
my life with you."

836
00:58:29,422 --> 00:58:30,719
Hey, hello my dear.

837
00:58:30,924 --> 00:58:32,050
What are you doing here?

838
00:58:32,659 --> 00:58:35,219
Well I'm here for a...
you know an ad shoot...

839
00:58:35,428 --> 00:58:38,886
...and well actually Nikki
I'm not going to lie to you.

840
00:58:39,265 --> 00:58:41,563
I came here with Amanda.
We are here for the weekend.

841
00:58:41,768 --> 00:58:48,071
So are we. This is Neal and
I'm not going to lie to you...

842
00:58:48,274 --> 00:58:54,406
...this is my Neal.
Neal this is an old friend, Trish.

843
00:58:55,215 --> 00:58:57,513
No way! You're Trish?

844
00:58:57,951 --> 00:58:59,248
Yeah the only one!

845
00:58:59,953 --> 00:59:02,751
I'm like a big fan!
I've seen all your ads.

846
00:59:03,056 --> 00:59:05,320
Especially your underwear one,
that's my favorite!

847
00:59:07,360 --> 00:59:12,764
Get it on, get going man.
The briefs that make you feel like superman.'

848
00:59:16,035 --> 00:59:18,435
That's my favorite too you know?
Really!

849
00:59:25,144 --> 00:59:25,906
What happened to him?

850
00:59:26,479 --> 00:59:29,778
He talks in French when
he gets really excited.

851
00:59:30,316 --> 00:59:32,784
Yes, yes, true, true, yes!

852
00:59:32,986 --> 00:59:35,511
Hey why don't you guys come
to my place for the day?

853
00:59:35,722 --> 00:59:37,121
I don't think we can...
- We would love to.

854
00:59:37,323 --> 00:59:40,451
Ah great! So I'll sms you
the address with directions.

855
00:59:40,827 --> 00:59:44,126
It's not far, it's like half an hour
from here but you know...

856
00:59:44,397 --> 00:59:47,798
...the way Nikki drives it might take
you like maximum five minutes.

857
00:59:49,002 --> 00:59:50,026
I know what you mean!

858
00:59:51,137 --> 00:59:53,037
So Neal it was really
good to meet you!

859
00:59:53,239 --> 00:59:54,968
Yeah, it was good to
meet you too ah!

860
01:00:00,246 --> 01:00:01,213
What are you doing?

861
01:00:01,514 --> 01:00:04,312
Helping you!
You wanted Trish back, right?

862
01:00:04,684 --> 01:00:06,743
Did you notice that he couldn't
lie to you about Amanda?

863
01:00:07,020 --> 01:00:08,078
He still loves you!

864
01:00:08,354 --> 01:00:09,651
Why do you think he
invited us to his house?

865
01:00:09,856 --> 01:00:11,483
Because he likes you
and not me!

866
01:00:11,691 --> 01:00:14,489
He was totally indifferent towards me.

867
01:00:14,694 --> 01:00:16,161
I'm going back to Vancouver

868
01:00:17,630 --> 01:00:20,155
If that's the case, then why is he
turning around and checking you out!

869
01:00:21,034 --> 01:00:23,502
Really? Is he checking me
out now? - Not now!

870
01:00:24,971 --> 01:00:26,165
Ok, you can look now!

871
01:00:29,876 --> 01:00:33,175
Just make him more jealous and
he'll come running back to you!

872
01:00:33,546 --> 01:00:34,945
You're good!

873
01:00:35,281 --> 01:00:36,179
I'm driving!

874
01:01:07,146 --> 01:01:08,613
Hey guys please come in!

875
01:01:08,815 --> 01:01:10,282
What a cool place you
have here Trish!

876
01:01:10,483 --> 01:01:12,280
Thank you!
Well, the girls seem to like it.

877
01:01:12,485 --> 01:01:13,042
Where's Amanda?

878
01:01:13,252 --> 01:01:14,617
She's upstairs getting ready.

879
01:01:14,821 --> 01:01:15,287
Ah, cool.

880
01:01:15,488 --> 01:01:19,549
Hey I've put some crabs on the barbeque.
It might take a while to get ready.

881
01:01:19,759 --> 01:01:20,953
You guys want to play a game?

882
01:01:21,160 --> 01:01:21,626
Yeah.

883
01:01:21,828 --> 01:01:23,125
What about water volleyball?

884
01:01:23,329 --> 01:01:23,795
Super!

885
01:01:23,996 --> 01:01:25,293
Great. So we have a guest room
just over there.

886
01:01:25,498 --> 01:01:26,294
You can get changed.

887
01:01:26,499 --> 01:01:28,296
And I'll meet you in the pool.

888
01:01:29,335 --> 01:01:33,294
Hey, Nikki you look different.
Is it a new hair cut?

889
01:01:33,506 --> 01:01:35,303
It's her eyes,
she's tried something new.

890
01:01:35,908 --> 01:01:41,403
You're right Neal...
it's in the eyes. See you!

891
01:01:43,182 --> 01:01:44,479
How's it going, guys?

892
01:02:00,967 --> 01:02:01,763
Hey you!

893
01:02:01,968 --> 01:02:02,935
Hi Amanda

894
01:02:03,202 --> 01:02:05,102
Oh I just loved the way you
sing to Nikki.

895
01:02:05,471 --> 01:02:07,769
I mean I've never seen
someone so romantic.

896
01:02:08,474 --> 01:02:14,106
I have to tell you it did something to me.
Something deep inside.

897
01:02:14,480 --> 01:02:17,608
I mean I would do anything for
a man who would sing to me.

898
01:02:18,584 --> 01:02:20,484
Do you want to swap partners?

899
01:02:20,686 --> 01:02:21,277
Huh!?

900
01:02:21,554 --> 01:02:23,852
In water volleyball, silly.

901
01:02:24,157 --> 01:02:26,284
Come on you should be on my team,
I think it would be fun!

902
01:02:26,993 --> 01:02:27,960
Let the games begin!

903
01:02:59,759 --> 01:03:02,387
If you a get this next one,
I'll sleep with you.

904
01:03:04,931 --> 01:03:06,398
You're dead, you're gone.

905
01:03:06,599 --> 01:03:07,896
Let's go! Let's go!

906
01:03:08,100 --> 01:03:10,898
I'm coming to get you!
You are history!

907
01:03:17,777 --> 01:03:18,471
I'm sorry

908
01:03:20,112 --> 01:03:21,079
Are you sure you're okay?

909
01:03:21,280 --> 01:03:24,078
Yeah of course... it has
swollen up, hasn't it?

910
01:03:24,951 --> 01:03:25,918
Just a little bit

911
01:03:26,285 --> 01:03:27,411
How big is a little?

912
01:03:29,121 --> 01:03:31,419
Oh my God! Show me a mirror now!

913
01:03:32,291 --> 01:03:34,418
And you can carry me Trishi pooh!

914
01:03:40,633 --> 01:03:41,429
Where are you going?

915
01:03:41,634 --> 01:03:43,261
I'm going to kill Neal!

916
01:03:43,469 --> 01:03:45,266
Wait, but it will slowly go down

917
01:03:45,638 --> 01:03:47,105
I'm still going to kill Neal!

918
01:03:48,140 --> 01:03:48,936
Wait, wait, wait. Ma chere.

919
01:03:50,643 --> 01:03:53,510
Nobody is going to
notice your nose, I promise you.

920
01:03:54,213 --> 01:03:55,942
Not when they can see
the rest of you.

921
01:03:58,150 --> 01:04:00,209
Do know what was the first thing
I noticed about you?

922
01:04:00,753 --> 01:04:01,777
My eyes?

923
01:04:02,655 --> 01:04:08,287
No it was your smile,
your eyes... this was a bonus

924
01:04:12,999 --> 01:04:18,960
From the colors of the rainbow,
with the kohl...

925
01:04:19,171 --> 01:04:23,130
...from your eyes, I've written
your name across my heart!

926
01:04:31,851 --> 01:04:34,820
Come on! Let's go!

927
01:04:35,021 --> 01:04:36,648
Now? - Yes, Now!

928
01:04:36,856 --> 01:04:38,585
But I mean, I'm like, like you know

929
01:04:38,791 --> 01:04:39,655
Come on! Let's go.

930
01:04:40,359 --> 01:04:41,087
No!

931
01:04:41,294 --> 01:04:42,090
I love you!

932
01:04:43,029 --> 01:04:44,326
No! She is mine.

933
01:04:45,932 --> 01:04:47,092
Ok tell me now, what happened?

934
01:04:47,300 --> 01:04:48,324
Nothing!

935
01:04:48,701 --> 01:04:51,670
Oh my God! You did it! He wants
you back, right?

936
01:04:51,871 --> 01:04:54,669
Yup he loves me and he hates you!!!!!

937
01:04:55,041 --> 01:04:58,670
I just hate him! What the hell are you
doing with a guy like him?

938
01:04:58,878 --> 01:05:01,847
Did you hear him when you were singing...
he... he sounds like a pig...

939
01:05:02,048 --> 01:05:03,345
...a pig with a sore throat!

940
01:05:03,549 --> 01:05:06,017
I'm jealous, Nikki. It just
destroys me inside.

941
01:05:06,218 --> 01:05:09,676
It hurt me so... so bad!
Trishi pooh misses you so much!

942
01:05:09,889 --> 01:05:13,347
I need you again! Please!
Come back in my life! Please!

943
01:05:14,060 --> 01:05:14,856
And Amanda?

944
01:05:15,161 --> 01:05:19,029
Amanda? Phhh, Gone! Finished!
Over! Wuuush! Asta Lavista Baby!

945
01:05:19,231 --> 01:05:21,529
Aha! I told you! I told you so!

946
01:05:21,734 --> 01:05:24,601
Knowing you, you must have melted
and gone running into his arms and said...

947
01:05:24,804 --> 01:05:26,362
...it's so good to have you back, Trishi pooh!

948
01:05:26,572 --> 01:05:30,030
No! I left him! I dumped him!

949
01:05:30,242 --> 01:05:30,708
What?

950
01:05:37,183 --> 01:05:39,879
What? - I don't know?
I don't understand French.

951
01:05:40,186 --> 01:05:42,381
But I thought you loved him!

952
01:05:42,588 --> 01:05:43,555
Then why did you dump him?

953
01:05:43,756 --> 01:05:45,451
Because he cheated on me!

954
01:05:45,925 --> 01:05:49,884
The day I found out that
he was seeing Amanda...

955
01:05:50,096 --> 01:05:52,064
...while he was with me, I forgot
everything we ever had!

956
01:05:52,264 --> 01:05:56,564
The only thing that upset me was
why didn't I dump him first!

957
01:05:56,769 --> 01:06:01,729
At first I thought it was my fault
that he left me for Amanda!

958
01:06:01,941 --> 01:06:04,739
He made me hate me
and then it hit me.

959
01:06:04,944 --> 01:06:07,242
Who's he to dump me?

960
01:06:07,446 --> 01:06:10,711
I'll be the one to dump him.

961
01:06:10,950 --> 01:06:14,750
So you did all this to get him back
only so you could dump him?

962
01:06:15,121 --> 01:06:17,089
Yup - Doesn't make sense?

963
01:06:17,289 --> 01:06:19,757
You're a guy... you won't understand!

964
01:06:19,959 --> 01:06:23,918
Nikki Bakshi you've got guts! I like it.
I hope you let him off easy.

965
01:06:24,130 --> 01:06:29,591
Ya, you know me, I can't hurt anyone.
I'm harmless!

966
01:06:33,305 --> 01:06:36,433
Come on, Neal!
Let's go! - Ok, but where?

967
01:06:37,176 --> 01:06:40,612
It's payback time!
You've done all this for me.

968
01:06:40,813 --> 01:06:45,614
Now it's my turn. I'll give you
everything you've ever wanted!

969
01:06:46,318 --> 01:06:48,445
Nikki Bakshi is going
to give you a night...

970
01:06:48,654 --> 01:06:51,452
...you're going to remember
for the rest of your life!

971
01:06:51,824 --> 01:06:54,622
Wait a minute,
What's on your mind huh?

972
01:06:55,161 --> 01:06:56,628
Why don't you read it!

973
01:07:06,939 --> 01:07:08,736
Why are these people celebrating
Christmas in summer?

974
01:07:09,275 --> 01:07:10,572
Have you seen the elves?

975
01:07:10,843 --> 01:07:12,743
Oh my God, can I be Santa?

976
01:07:13,279 --> 01:07:14,576
Go ahead, pick an elf!

977
01:07:15,448 --> 01:07:18,246
What's the hurry? We've just arrived.
Let me check them out!

978
01:07:27,526 --> 01:07:28,652
Can I have some red wine please?

979
01:07:28,861 --> 01:07:30,488
Of course. Here you are

980
01:07:30,696 --> 01:07:32,323
Thank you.
- Hey do you want to dance?

981
01:07:32,898 --> 01:07:33,660
Ya, Sure...

982
01:07:39,705 --> 01:07:44,335
Come on, come on, show it to me!
Oh no, I'm going to beat that!

983
01:07:45,878 --> 01:07:47,004
What are you playing?

984
01:07:47,246 --> 01:07:49,339
Strip poker! The one who loses
in this game has...

985
01:07:49,548 --> 01:07:51,175
...to take a piece of their clothing off!

986
01:07:51,383 --> 01:07:52,680
Ok I'm going to show it to you now...

987
01:07:57,056 --> 01:07:59,854
Ok as you can see I am winning.

988
01:08:02,061 --> 01:08:03,688
Excellent girls excellent, excellent!

989
01:08:03,896 --> 01:08:04,692
I want to play, too.

990
01:08:04,930 --> 01:08:06,022
What?

991
01:08:06,232 --> 01:08:07,199
Yes I want to play too!

992
01:08:08,067 --> 01:08:09,864
Guys, can I play?

993
01:08:10,069 --> 01:08:10,865
For sure girl!

994
01:08:11,070 --> 01:08:12,537
For sure you can play!

995
01:08:12,738 --> 01:08:14,035
I'll do anything to get you to play!

996
01:08:14,740 --> 01:08:15,536
You're not playing!

997
01:08:16,075 --> 01:08:18,703
Ah C'mon man let her play,
look at her, she's hot!

998
01:08:18,911 --> 01:08:20,208
Nikki, get up! - No.

999
01:08:20,412 --> 01:08:21,879
You can't play! - Why?

1000
01:08:22,081 --> 01:08:23,878
Because I've said so,
this game is not for you.

1001
01:08:24,250 --> 01:08:27,549
Why? What are you afraid of?
That I'll win...

1002
01:08:27,753 --> 01:08:30,221
...or that I'll lose?

1003
01:08:32,258 --> 01:08:35,056
Ok, fine! Deal...

1004
01:08:37,429 --> 01:08:40,227
Ya now it's going to get good!

1005
01:08:40,432 --> 01:08:45,233
So guy's if I lose,
what do I take off first?

1006
01:08:45,638 --> 01:08:48,573
Ooh damn girl you don't even
want me to answer that.

1007
01:08:50,609 --> 01:08:53,237
Yey! So how many cards do I deal?

1008
01:08:53,979 --> 01:08:55,913
Neal! Have you gone crazy!
Don't touch me!

1009
01:08:56,115 --> 01:08:57,412
I'm just taking you for a little ride

1010
01:08:58,117 --> 01:09:00,415
Put me down! What are you doing?
I will hit you! I will hurt you!

1011
01:09:00,619 --> 01:09:01,916
One second - Put me down

1012
01:09:02,121 --> 01:09:04,089
Here! - Put me down, God!

1013
01:09:04,290 --> 01:09:06,087
You can play, but I can't?

1014
01:09:06,292 --> 01:09:08,419
You have such double standards!
What's your problem?

1015
01:09:08,627 --> 01:09:10,254
What's my problem?
What's your problem!

1016
01:09:10,462 --> 01:09:12,930
Actually forget it, you won't
understand. You're a girl!

1017
01:09:14,133 --> 01:09:19,935
Neal! Neal, Neal hey listen,

1018
01:09:20,139 --> 01:09:22,607
Listen, I'm sorry!
I was just bugging you!

1019
01:09:22,975 --> 01:09:26,433
Please sorry? You know when
you get angry you...

1020
01:09:26,645 --> 01:09:32,277
...look just like Scooby Doo.
Go ahead pick a girl.

1021
01:09:33,485 --> 01:09:36,454
Yes, think of this as
a Christmas present from me.

1022
01:09:36,655 --> 01:09:38,122
Pick the best one...

1023
01:09:38,324 --> 01:09:41,293
The girl who makes you
go weak in the knees!

1024
01:09:43,562 --> 01:09:47,123
So Neal, who's the girl who really
really does it for you?

1025
01:09:50,936 --> 01:09:51,527
You.

1026
01:10:03,515 --> 01:10:04,482
Why did you do that?

1027
01:10:05,351 --> 01:10:07,649
Because you also wanted it! - No.

1028
01:10:07,853 --> 01:10:10,321
Come on Nikki, don't you think
something is happening between us?

1029
01:10:10,522 --> 01:10:12,149
Nothing is happening between us!

1030
01:10:12,358 --> 01:10:14,485
You know you're lying.
Why are you lying?

1031
01:10:14,860 --> 01:10:16,157
Look at the way you
give me that look.

1032
01:10:16,362 --> 01:10:16,828
What look?

1033
01:10:17,029 --> 01:10:19,827
That look! That 'come on
baby Rock My World' look!

1034
01:10:20,032 --> 01:10:22,660
Yuck! Puke.
You and me? Never!

1035
01:10:22,935 --> 01:10:25,495
You're a jerk who's getting
married in a few days...

1036
01:10:25,704 --> 01:10:28,002
...and you've come here only
to get some action.

1037
01:10:28,207 --> 01:10:30,004
I am the good girl in the story.

1038
01:10:30,209 --> 01:10:31,676
Nothing can ever happen between us!

1039
01:10:31,877 --> 01:10:32,844
Nothing? - Nothing!

1040
01:10:33,045 --> 01:10:35,513
You didn't feel a thing?
You didn't feel the chemistry?

1041
01:10:35,714 --> 01:10:36,339
No!

1042
01:10:36,548 --> 01:10:38,175
Don't you think the both
of us are always looking...

1043
01:10:38,384 --> 01:10:39,681
...for reasons to come
close to each other?

1044
01:10:39,885 --> 01:10:44,015
Really you didn't feel
anything at all? Nothing?

1045
01:10:48,060 --> 01:10:52,690
Oh my God! That was amazing!
You can't make me feel this good!

1046
01:10:53,565 --> 01:10:54,532
What's wrong with you?

1047
01:10:57,069 --> 01:10:59,037
We have to solve this.
We have a problem!

1048
01:10:59,238 --> 01:10:59,704
Ok

1049
01:10:59,905 --> 01:11:02,032
Nothing can happen between
the two us! - Nothing

1050
01:11:02,241 --> 01:11:04,539
You go that way
and I'll go this way!

1051
01:11:04,910 --> 01:11:06,207
We'll stay far away
from each other!

1052
01:11:06,578 --> 01:11:11,038
Ya, that's a good idea!
Brilliant! Go!

1053
01:11:11,250 --> 01:11:13,718
Ok. You sure? - Ya!

1054
01:11:14,086 --> 01:11:14,552
Cool.

1055
01:11:15,087 --> 01:11:16,054
See you in a hundred years.

1056
01:12:16,715 --> 01:12:20,446
What have I done?
I spent the night with Neal.

1057
01:12:21,487 --> 01:12:27,619
Neal the jerk. Neal the idiot...
Neal... the wonderful.

1058
01:12:28,727 --> 01:12:33,289
Last night was wonderful.
I've never felt so complete.

1059
01:12:33,732 --> 01:12:35,962
I don't know if you're feeling
the same way or not?

1060
01:12:36,668 --> 01:12:42,629
This feels so right. No you feel right.
Last night felt so right.

1061
01:12:43,342 --> 01:12:48,302
Neal you've lost it!
You're talking about Nikki.

1062
01:12:50,682 --> 01:12:53,651
The same girl who went
crazy about her ex-boyfriend...

1063
01:12:54,353 --> 01:12:55,650
...the same girl who wanted
to cut off your...

1064
01:12:56,188 --> 01:12:57,985
Good morning.
- Good morning.

1065
01:13:04,196 --> 01:13:07,324
Good morning?
What's the meaning of good morning?

1066
01:13:08,367 --> 01:13:11,996
Nikki, good morning means
that last night was...

1067
01:13:12,204 --> 01:13:16,504
...nothing for him.
You were just another girl.

1068
01:13:16,708 --> 01:13:19,506
Idiot why did you say
good morning like that?

1069
01:13:20,045 --> 01:13:23,173
Ok turn around,
hold her, and tell her...

1070
01:13:23,382 --> 01:13:24,849
...how wonderful
this morning really is.

1071
01:13:27,386 --> 01:13:31,345
Why did she get up? Ok before
she goes somewhere talk to her!

1072
01:13:32,558 --> 01:13:33,684
It's a nice day isn't it?

1073
01:13:33,892 --> 01:13:35,860
I don't believe this,
now we're going to talk...

1074
01:13:36,061 --> 01:13:38,359
...about the weather?
How predictable,

1075
01:13:38,564 --> 01:13:41,533
who wants to talk
about last night? No one!

1076
01:13:45,070 --> 01:13:46,037
Would you like some coffee?

1077
01:13:46,238 --> 01:13:48,866
Coffee!? What I would like to
know is how were you...

1078
01:13:49,074 --> 01:13:51,542
...last night, Mister Know It AII?

1079
01:13:51,743 --> 01:13:54,041
What I would like to
know is am I one of...

1080
01:13:54,246 --> 01:13:55,873
...those girls you came
to Vancouver for?

1081
01:13:56,081 --> 01:13:58,379
What I would like to know is
why are you asking me for coffee?

1082
01:13:58,584 --> 01:13:59,710
Coffee would be fine!

1083
01:14:03,755 --> 01:14:06,053
Coffee!? Why did I ask
her for coffee?

1084
01:14:06,258 --> 01:14:07,555
I don't even know
how to make coffee!

1085
01:14:35,621 --> 01:14:38,590
I wonder why I didn't
meet you earlier?

1086
01:14:39,291 --> 01:14:41,088
I think that... - Don't even think that!

1087
01:14:41,293 --> 01:14:43,761
If you think that I am going
to drink that coffee...

1088
01:14:43,962 --> 01:14:44,929
...you must be crazy!

1089
01:14:46,798 --> 01:14:51,098
Look at her. She will be the perfect wife.
Mom will also like her.

1090
01:14:51,470 --> 01:14:54,598
Actually mom won't like
her at all, but who cares?

1091
01:14:56,975 --> 01:14:59,102
Nikki... I want to say something

1092
01:14:59,478 --> 01:15:01,946
I knew this was coming,
next he'll say

1093
01:15:02,147 --> 01:15:07,107
Nikki you're very sweet and
last night was very special but...

1094
01:15:07,319 --> 01:15:10,447
Nikki you're very sweet and
last night was very special...

1095
01:15:10,656 --> 01:15:14,114
Nikki he's about to dump you,
just like Trish!

1096
01:15:14,326 --> 01:15:15,418
Don't let him do it.

1097
01:15:15,627 --> 01:15:18,289
Before he dumps you, dump him!

1098
01:15:21,500 --> 01:15:24,298
Neal I know what you're
going to say.

1099
01:15:25,370 --> 01:15:29,306
What happened last night,
happens only with few people.

1100
01:15:29,508 --> 01:15:32,636
Wow Neal! You and
Nikki think alike!

1101
01:15:33,345 --> 01:15:35,313
This is the perfect moment.
Propose to her!

1102
01:15:35,681 --> 01:15:37,649
Tell her you want to marry her.

1103
01:15:39,918 --> 01:15:42,478
Oh God, how pathetic!
What's he doing on his knees?

1104
01:15:42,854 --> 01:15:45,652
Will he beg?
Will he ask me not to tell anyone?

1105
01:15:45,857 --> 01:15:47,984
Will he tell me not to expect
anything from him?

1106
01:15:48,193 --> 01:15:51,492
Before he hurts you, dump him!

1107
01:15:51,697 --> 01:15:56,327
It's ok, get up.
You can forget about last night.

1108
01:15:56,702 --> 01:15:57,999
It didn't mean a thing.

1109
01:15:58,537 --> 01:16:00,164
Let's move on, shall we?

1110
01:16:11,550 --> 01:16:12,517
Do you want me to drive?

1111
01:16:13,385 --> 01:16:14,010
No

1112
01:16:16,555 --> 01:16:18,182
Why, do you want to drive?

1113
01:16:18,557 --> 01:16:19,182
No

1114
01:16:23,395 --> 01:16:25,022
Do you want me to drive?

1115
01:16:25,230 --> 01:16:25,696
No.

1116
01:16:26,765 --> 01:16:28,699
Good! - Good!

1117
01:16:28,900 --> 01:16:29,867
Great!

1118
01:16:47,919 --> 01:16:49,216
Did you want to listen?

1119
01:16:49,588 --> 01:16:50,213
No.

1120
01:16:51,423 --> 01:16:52,390
Good

1121
01:17:16,014 --> 01:17:16,912
Why have we stopped?

1122
01:17:17,149 --> 01:17:20,585
Guys, can we, can we please get
a ride to Vancouver? - Please?

1123
01:17:20,819 --> 01:17:22,582
We've been walking on
this road for so long.

1124
01:17:22,788 --> 01:17:24,415
And, and we just really
need to get back.

1125
01:17:24,623 --> 01:17:26,591
I mean, we're going
to lose our jobs if we don't.

1126
01:17:26,792 --> 01:17:27,588
Please.

1127
01:17:27,793 --> 01:17:29,090
Can we please get a ride?

1128
01:17:30,462 --> 01:17:31,588
Get in.

1129
01:17:37,369 --> 01:17:38,597
Can I turn the radio on?

1130
01:17:49,381 --> 01:17:50,780
Look what's he doing,
he's touching...

1131
01:17:50,982 --> 01:17:53,450
...the poor thing all over.

1132
01:17:53,985 --> 01:17:55,452
He's doing it with her permission...

1133
01:17:55,987 --> 01:17:58,114
...and she seems to be enjoying it.

1134
01:17:58,990 --> 01:18:01,788
I knew the moment I saw him
that he is a scoundrel!

1135
01:18:02,661 --> 01:18:04,788
It could also be the other way around,
she could be playing him

1136
01:18:05,497 --> 01:18:08,796
It could also be that he will take
advantage of her and then leave her!

1137
01:18:09,000 --> 01:18:10,968
If she wants she can stop him...

1138
01:18:11,169 --> 01:18:12,796
...but it's fairly obvious
that she doesn't want to.

1139
01:18:13,171 --> 01:18:16,800
I knew you would think like that!
You guys are all the same.

1140
01:18:17,008 --> 01:18:18,475
After you get what you
want you're gone!

1141
01:18:18,677 --> 01:18:21,646
It's not always our fault!
She must have brought...

1142
01:18:22,080 --> 01:18:23,809
...the poor guy here
by blinding him with...

1143
01:18:24,015 --> 01:18:25,642
...her sweet talk so she can
have a good time.

1144
01:18:26,084 --> 01:18:28,314
She probably has an ex-boyfriend
who dumped her...

1145
01:18:28,520 --> 01:18:30,147
...and now she's using this guy
to get even with him.

1146
01:18:39,531 --> 01:18:39,997
Get out!

1147
01:18:40,699 --> 01:18:45,830
Nikki? Nikki?
What are you doing? Nikki?

1148
01:18:46,204 --> 01:18:47,330
What's wrong with you?

1149
01:18:47,539 --> 01:18:51,339
I'm saying goodbye! Last night was
the biggest mistake of my life.

1150
01:18:51,543 --> 01:18:54,512
Nikki, Nikki, Nikki,
Nikki listen to me, Nikki...

1151
01:18:54,713 --> 01:18:58,843
And now you're the idiot who I have
to remember for the rest of my life.

1152
01:19:17,002 --> 01:19:18,469
Get out! Get out!

1153
01:20:19,698 --> 01:20:21,290
With God's grace I've been
given this opportunity...

1154
01:20:21,466 --> 01:20:25,926
...to unite two wonderful families.

1155
01:20:26,972 --> 01:20:31,272
This is Baldev Raj, who I know
for quite some time.

1156
01:20:31,476 --> 01:20:33,603
It's ok, stay seated please.

1157
01:20:33,812 --> 01:20:36,940
This is Sweety's mother
who's come from Bhatinda,

1158
01:20:37,649 --> 01:20:39,617
And this is her elder brother Kuldeep...

1159
01:20:40,018 --> 01:20:43,613
...who owns this house.
Sister, please call Sweety.

1160
01:20:48,326 --> 01:20:53,958
"With anklets on her feet, the girl with
a creamy complexion has arrived."

1161
01:20:54,332 --> 01:20:59,133
"Everyone calls her Sweety."

1162
01:20:59,838 --> 01:21:08,473
"Everyone calls her Sweety."

1163
01:21:09,681 --> 01:21:14,118
Hello - Wow, she's beautiful!

1164
01:21:14,586 --> 01:21:16,645
Is this the first time you've
come to Canada?

1165
01:21:17,522 --> 01:21:20,320
No, I used to come during
my summer vacations.

1166
01:21:20,525 --> 01:21:23,494
How do you like Canada?
- I feel at home!

1167
01:21:24,696 --> 01:21:26,823
Sweety, you forgot the cake...

1168
01:21:30,201 --> 01:21:33,500
You forgot the cake! Oh ehm, ehm,

1169
01:21:55,226 --> 01:21:58,855
This is my daughter Nikki. She and Sweety
are cousins, but they behave like sisters.

1170
01:21:59,230 --> 01:22:00,197
They've shared everything in life!

1171
01:22:00,899 --> 01:22:02,526
Tea? - No Thanks

1172
01:22:07,739 --> 01:22:09,866
Cake? - Yes Please!

1173
01:22:17,115 --> 01:22:19,049
Cake? - No, Thank you!

1174
01:22:26,257 --> 01:22:27,554
You, inside!

1175
01:22:41,773 --> 01:22:42,740
What are you doing here?

1176
01:22:42,941 --> 01:22:46,240
Mom said the boy's name
was Gurneal Ahluwalia

1177
01:22:46,778 --> 01:22:50,578
That would be me!
I am Gurneal Ahluwallia!

1178
01:22:50,815 --> 01:22:53,909
You know, GurNEAL Ahluwallia!

1179
01:22:54,352 --> 01:22:56,252
You know what you have to do, right?

1180
01:22:56,454 --> 01:22:58,922
I know, I have to change my name.

1181
01:22:59,124 --> 01:23:02,423
No, GurNEAL!
Go outside and tell everyone...

1182
01:23:02,627 --> 01:23:03,924
...that you can't go through
with this wedding.

1183
01:23:04,129 --> 01:23:07,098
Why? Why would I do that?

1184
01:23:09,300 --> 01:23:12,269
Because you don't want
to marry my cousin!

1185
01:23:13,304 --> 01:23:14,100
Sit.

1186
01:23:17,809 --> 01:23:19,936
I don't want to...
or you don't want me to?

1187
01:23:20,145 --> 01:23:21,112
I don't give a flying...

1188
01:23:21,813 --> 01:23:22,780
Fudge!

1189
01:23:22,981 --> 01:23:25,779
Really? By looking at you
it doesn't seem like it.

1190
01:23:25,984 --> 01:23:27,781
It looks like you give
a flying everything!

1191
01:23:27,986 --> 01:23:29,283
That's what you think!

1192
01:23:29,988 --> 01:23:31,114
You know what I think?

1193
01:23:31,322 --> 01:23:33,449
I think I should get
married to Sweety.

1194
01:23:33,658 --> 01:23:34,784
What? - Yes.

1195
01:23:34,993 --> 01:23:37,461
I kind of like her,
she's the type of girl...

1196
01:23:37,662 --> 01:23:39,960
...you get married to.
She's not the other type.

1197
01:23:40,398 --> 01:23:41,660
What other type?

1198
01:23:42,333 --> 01:23:44,631
The type of girls I've recently met...

1199
01:23:44,836 --> 01:23:46,804
Don't even go there

1200
01:23:47,005 --> 01:23:48,973
Like that girl...
what was her name?

1201
01:23:49,741 --> 01:23:53,472
Marie that witch! Or that
man-eating monster Karen?

1202
01:23:53,678 --> 01:23:55,145
Or that shameless,
naked girl who took...

1203
01:23:55,346 --> 01:23:57,814
...you to see the whales,
what was her name?

1204
01:23:58,016 --> 01:24:00,314
Hey, hey! That's not fair!
You're hitting below the belt

1205
01:24:00,518 --> 01:24:02,816
Oh, I haven't even started yet.

1206
01:24:07,358 --> 01:24:08,154
Hey, where are you going?

1207
01:24:08,693 --> 01:24:12,652
I'm going to tell everyone
what you were doing in Vancouver...

1208
01:24:13,364 --> 01:24:15,491
...or rather who you
were doing in Vancouver!

1209
01:24:15,700 --> 01:24:16,496
You wouldn't!

1210
01:24:17,202 --> 01:24:18,499
Wouldn't I?

1211
01:24:21,372 --> 01:24:22,168
Mamma...

1212
01:24:23,041 --> 01:24:26,010
Nikki! - What happened darling?

1213
01:24:26,211 --> 01:24:27,838
Neal wants to say something
to all of you!

1214
01:24:28,046 --> 01:24:29,013
I do!?

1215
01:24:29,380 --> 01:24:31,678
Neal, what's the matter son?
- Nothing.

1216
01:24:32,217 --> 01:24:34,185
Nothing at all, nothing, nothing,
what happened? Nothing

1217
01:24:34,385 --> 01:24:35,682
Neal wants to marry Sweety.

1218
01:24:35,887 --> 01:24:38,014
And he wants it to happen
as soon as possible.

1219
01:24:43,394 --> 01:24:45,521
Heartiest congratulations to all!

1220
01:24:55,240 --> 01:24:56,366
Marriages are made in heaven

1221
01:24:59,911 --> 01:25:03,039
Congratulations, Gurneal Ahluwallia!

1222
01:25:06,751 --> 01:25:10,710
Ok Nikki Bakshi, I will get married...

1223
01:25:11,489 --> 01:25:13,548
...but I'll make you dance
on my wedding day!

1224
01:25:20,932 --> 01:25:24,390
"I've locked eyes with
a beautiful girl."

1225
01:25:24,602 --> 01:25:28,402
"I've locked eyes with
a beautiful girl."

1226
01:25:36,447 --> 01:25:39,905
"Let's dance my friend,
I've locked eyes with her!"

1227
01:25:40,451 --> 01:25:43,750
"Let's rock my friend,
I've locked eyes her!"

1228
01:25:43,955 --> 01:25:47,755
"My love, I'm not going
to sleep tonight."

1229
01:25:47,959 --> 01:25:50,928
"My love, I'm not going
to sleep tonight."

1230
01:25:51,129 --> 01:25:57,932
"As today our eyes have met."

1231
01:25:58,803 --> 01:26:05,265
"As today our eyes have met."

1232
01:26:05,777 --> 01:26:08,905
"Dancing the night because
I've locked eyes with her."

1233
01:26:09,147 --> 01:26:12,776
"The feeling is right because
I've locked eyes with her."

1234
01:26:13,318 --> 01:26:16,446
"Party all night because
I've locked eyes with her."

1235
01:26:16,654 --> 01:26:20,454
"The music's so right because
I've locked eyes with her."

1236
01:26:36,174 --> 01:26:39,974
"Since our eyes have met,
I'm going to dance with you."

1237
01:26:40,178 --> 01:26:43,807
"With anklets on I'm going
to dance with you."

1238
01:26:47,485 --> 01:26:51,854
"Show me your moves if you
want to dance with me."

1239
01:26:51,990 --> 01:26:55,357
"Get in to groove if you want
to dance with me."

1240
01:26:55,526 --> 01:26:58,654
"My love, I'm not going
to sleep tonight."

1241
01:26:58,863 --> 01:27:01,832
"My love, I'm not going
to sleep tonight."

1242
01:27:02,200 --> 01:27:08,833
"As today our eyes have met."

1243
01:27:09,707 --> 01:27:16,510
"As today our eyes have met."

1244
01:27:16,714 --> 01:27:19,979
"Dancing the night because
I've locked eyes with her."

1245
01:27:20,218 --> 01:27:24,018
"The feeling is right because
I've locked eyes with her."

1246
01:27:24,222 --> 01:27:27,521
"Party all night because
I've locked eyes with her."

1247
01:27:27,892 --> 01:27:31,851
"The music's so right because
I've locked eyes with her."

1248
01:27:47,245 --> 01:27:51,204
"I'll flutter my eyes in your arms."

1249
01:27:51,416 --> 01:27:54,874
"I'll flutter your heart when I dance."

1250
01:27:58,856 --> 01:28:02,883
"I drive you crazy because
I'm making you crave."

1251
01:28:03,094 --> 01:28:06,222
"You want me baby because
I'm making you crave."

1252
01:28:06,431 --> 01:28:12,893
"My love, I'm not going
to sleep tonight."

1253
01:28:13,271 --> 01:28:27,083
"As today our eyes have met."

1254
01:28:27,485 --> 01:28:31,080
"I've locked eyes with
a beautiful girl."

1255
01:28:31,289 --> 01:28:35,089
"I've locked eyes with
a beautiful girl."

1256
01:28:42,633 --> 01:28:46,592
"Let's dance my friend,
I've locked eyes with her!"

1257
01:28:46,804 --> 01:28:50,103
"Let's rock my friend,
I've locked eyes her!"

1258
01:28:50,308 --> 01:28:57,441
"My love, I'm not going
to sleep tonight."

1259
01:28:57,648 --> 01:29:11,961
"As today our eyes have met."

1260
01:29:12,163 --> 01:29:15,291
"Dancing the night because
I've locked eyes with her."

1261
01:29:15,833 --> 01:29:19,462
"The feeling is right because
I've locked eyes with her."

1262
01:29:19,737 --> 01:29:23,298
"Party all night because
I've locked eyes with her."

1263
01:29:23,508 --> 01:29:27,467
"The music's so right because
I've locked eyes with her."

1264
01:29:52,537 --> 01:29:53,504
Corkscrew?

1265
01:29:57,708 --> 01:29:59,505
So, you are getting married to her?

1266
01:30:00,378 --> 01:30:02,346
Isn't that what you wanted?

1267
01:30:02,713 --> 01:30:05,682
Ok fine, Get married to her!

1268
01:30:06,217 --> 01:30:07,275
See if I care...

1269
01:30:07,952 --> 01:30:09,419
No! I won't!

1270
01:30:13,391 --> 01:30:14,358
You won't?

1271
01:30:14,559 --> 01:30:20,361
No because I know you won't
let this wedding happen!

1272
01:30:20,565 --> 01:30:22,692
Really? Why?
Why would I do that?

1273
01:30:23,234 --> 01:30:25,031
I know you Nikki Bakshi!

1274
01:30:25,803 --> 01:30:28,704
You couldn't watch me
dance with Sweety...

1275
01:30:29,407 --> 01:30:31,375
...how will you let me marry her?

1276
01:30:35,746 --> 01:30:39,045
I hate you, Gurneal Ahluwallia,
I hate you.

1277
01:31:10,181 --> 01:31:12,581
Hello, welcome. - Hello!

1278
01:31:12,850 --> 01:31:13,578
Heartiest Congratulations!
- To you too!

1279
01:31:13,784 --> 01:31:15,752
Here I am, and where are you?

1280
01:31:16,854 --> 01:31:20,415
Ah, you must be bringing
the puja plate! That's where you are...

1281
01:31:25,129 --> 01:31:26,596
Aunty where is Nikki?

1282
01:31:26,797 --> 01:31:29,265
I don't know, we've also been
searching for her since morning.

1283
01:31:30,301 --> 01:31:31,598
Where has she gone?
Nikki where are you?

1284
01:31:37,475 --> 01:31:41,275
Hi, hi. Good, How are you?
Listen I need to talk to you

1285
01:31:41,479 --> 01:31:42,605
We've got it all planned out Neal.

1286
01:31:42,813 --> 01:31:44,280
In about a week this
whole drama will turn into...

1287
01:31:44,482 --> 01:31:45,278
What drama?

1288
01:31:45,483 --> 01:31:48,281
If you run out from your own engagement
there's obviously going to be some drama!

1289
01:31:48,486 --> 01:31:49,111
Who is running from the engagement?

1290
01:31:49,320 --> 01:31:51,447
You, of course. We couldn't do it
but now you can do it.

1291
01:31:52,023 --> 01:31:52,955
Here are the tickets...

1292
01:31:53,324 --> 01:31:54,621
And the car is waiting
for you in the back.

1293
01:31:54,825 --> 01:31:56,793
I am not running anywhere,
I'm looking for Nikki

1294
01:31:56,994 --> 01:31:58,120
Thank you - Nikki?

1295
01:31:58,329 --> 01:31:59,125
Who's Nikki?

1296
01:31:59,497 --> 01:32:03,456
Nikki, my Nikki!
The girl I'm getting married to!

1297
01:32:03,668 --> 01:32:04,794
Her name is
Sweety! Not Nikki!

1298
01:32:05,002 --> 01:32:05,798
No dude! You're not getting it.

1299
01:32:06,003 --> 01:32:08,631
I get it! He's lost it.
He's hysterical.

1300
01:32:08,839 --> 01:32:09,635
He can't think straight anymore!

1301
01:32:09,840 --> 01:32:10,465
Maybe his suit is too tight.

1302
01:32:10,675 --> 01:32:12,472
Sometimes I can't think straight
when I'm wearing tight clothes.

1303
01:32:12,677 --> 01:32:14,144
You're always wearing tight clothes.
- Exactly.

1304
01:32:14,345 --> 01:32:16,813
Guys! Guys! Focus!
Look for Nikki!

1305
01:32:17,915 --> 01:32:20,816
Neal what are you doing
standing here?

1306
01:32:21,352 --> 01:32:23,650
We're all waiting for you.
Come son, come!

1307
01:32:23,854 --> 01:32:25,481
Oh I need to check on
all the preparations.

1308
01:32:26,524 --> 01:32:27,491
Aunty, has Nikki arrived?

1309
01:32:27,692 --> 01:32:30,661
No she hasn't come yet.
I don't know where this girl has gone?

1310
01:32:34,532 --> 01:32:37,990
Welcome all. Today we have all
gathered here for the engagement

1311
01:32:38,202 --> 01:32:42,161
ceremony of Satwinder Kaur
and Gurneal Ahluwallia.

1312
01:32:42,940 --> 01:32:45,500
May God shower
his blessings upon them.

1313
01:32:46,377 --> 01:32:48,504
And now they shall exchange
the engagement rings.

1314
01:32:51,282 --> 01:32:52,340
No thanks

1315
01:32:54,885 --> 01:32:57,683
This is not good!
Where are you Nikki?

1316
01:32:58,055 --> 01:32:59,522
I'm going to get engaged.

1317
01:33:00,558 --> 01:33:03,186
Is this an engagement ring?
- Yes, son

1318
01:33:03,394 --> 01:33:04,861
When this is slipped
into someones finger...

1319
01:33:05,062 --> 01:33:07,030
...does it mean you are engaged?

1320
01:33:07,231 --> 01:33:10,689
Good, son. Now you understood everything.

1321
01:33:11,402 --> 01:33:14,200
And then after the engagement,
it's the wedding? - Yes of course!

1322
01:33:14,405 --> 01:33:15,201
One second...

1323
01:33:19,577 --> 01:33:21,545
Have you seen Nikki?

1324
01:33:21,746 --> 01:33:24,214
Nikki? No

1325
01:33:24,749 --> 01:33:25,716
Ok Go back.

1326
01:33:35,593 --> 01:33:37,561
It's mine. Hello?

1327
01:33:37,762 --> 01:33:39,059
Are you the jerk
who slept with me and...

1328
01:33:39,263 --> 01:33:40,389
...is now marrying my cousin sister?

1329
01:33:40,598 --> 01:33:44,056
Yes! I'm the jerk
who's marrying your cousin.

1330
01:33:44,268 --> 01:33:45,735
So you're not going to
stop this engagement?

1331
01:33:45,936 --> 01:33:49,064
No! And if you don't want
this engagement...

1332
01:33:49,273 --> 01:33:50,740
...to happen, you know
what have to do!

1333
01:33:52,276 --> 01:33:53,903
Yes Gyaniji, where were we?

1334
01:34:03,154 --> 01:34:03,745
She's here!

1335
01:34:23,641 --> 01:34:25,108
This engagement can't happen!

1336
01:34:25,309 --> 01:34:27,607
Happy, what's happened to you?

1337
01:34:27,812 --> 01:34:29,279
I'm not going to allow this
engagement to happen!

1338
01:34:31,849 --> 01:34:37,617
I love Sweety, I've loved her
since childhood!

1339
01:34:38,656 --> 01:34:41,284
We've even exchanged vows
over the internet.

1340
01:34:42,993 --> 01:34:44,620
I can't live without her.

1341
01:35:02,346 --> 01:35:06,806
What's happening? Sweety and
Neal's marriage is confirmed!

1342
01:35:08,686 --> 01:35:12,315
I know father that you don't
want me to marry Sweety.

1343
01:35:12,690 --> 01:35:16,148
You're always saying
that Sweety is very clever...

1344
01:35:16,527 --> 01:35:18,154
...that she'll make a mouse out of me...

1345
01:35:18,362 --> 01:35:19,829
...and that she's perfect for Neal.

1346
01:35:20,097 --> 01:35:21,325
Gyaniji?

1347
01:35:21,866 --> 01:35:25,165
But I don't believe it!
Do I look like a mouse?

1348
01:35:26,704 --> 01:35:27,830
Sweety, hold this please.

1349
01:35:31,041 --> 01:35:33,669
Neal brother,
I'm a lover not a fighter.

1350
01:35:33,878 --> 01:35:35,675
But for Sweety I'm ready to fight.

1351
01:35:35,880 --> 01:35:37,677
Put 'em up! Put em up, brother.

1352
01:35:38,048 --> 01:35:39,345
Happy you cannot marry Sweety.

1353
01:35:39,550 --> 01:35:40,676
No, no, no. She's all yours dude.

1354
01:35:40,885 --> 01:35:43,513
I don't want to marry Sweety.
Sweety is all yours! Enjoy.

1355
01:35:43,721 --> 01:35:45,985
Thanks Neal brother!
- You're welcome.

1356
01:35:46,190 --> 01:35:47,157
Lets go Sweety!

1357
01:35:48,058 --> 01:35:50,526
Happy, listen to me.
You cannot marry Sweety!

1358
01:35:50,728 --> 01:35:56,530
"Wearing a pink dress.
And sequined shoes."

1359
01:35:57,401 --> 01:36:00,029
"Come with me to the fair!"

1360
01:36:19,757 --> 01:36:22,555
Pick a line? - What?

1361
01:36:23,594 --> 01:36:26,563
Any line. - What do you mean?

1362
01:36:26,931 --> 01:36:30,890
When a boy asks a girl
for her hand in marriage...

1363
01:36:31,435 --> 01:36:34,404
...he needs to pick a line.
So what's your line?

1364
01:36:38,776 --> 01:36:42,735
Nikki Bakshi, will you marry me?

1365
01:36:43,113 --> 01:36:44,080
That's your line?

1366
01:36:44,782 --> 01:36:47,910
What part of falling in love
don't you understand, jerk!

1367
01:36:48,118 --> 01:36:52,248
I haven't met a stupid, dumb,
idiotic boy like you ever before!

1368
01:36:52,456 --> 01:36:55,084
Remember that morning, it was
such a special morning...

1369
01:36:55,292 --> 01:36:57,760
...but did you say
I love you Nikki baby?

1370
01:36:57,962 --> 01:36:59,759
No! You asked me do I want coffee?

1371
01:37:00,130 --> 01:37:02,598
I don't like coffee,
I don't even drink coffee.

1372
01:37:02,800 --> 01:37:03,425
You know what your problem is?

1373
01:37:03,601 --> 01:37:06,729
You're a thirteen year old spoilt brat who
will stay thirteen, for the rest of her life!

1374
01:37:07,304 --> 01:37:08,601
And I'm the only one who can
tolerate you because...

1375
01:37:08,806 --> 01:37:11,434
...I'm a fourteen year old brat who will be
fourteen years old for the rest of my life.

1376
01:37:11,642 --> 01:37:14,270
And that's why you fool we are
perfect for each other.

1377
01:37:15,813 --> 01:37:18,441
I want to be part of every
part of your life!

1378
01:37:19,650 --> 01:37:23,609
So now tell me
Nikki Bakshi, will you marry me?

1379
01:37:24,822 --> 01:37:27,290
First promise me that
whenever I get emotional...

1380
01:37:27,491 --> 01:37:28,458
you will take care of me?

1381
01:37:28,659 --> 01:37:29,284
Promise...

1382
01:37:29,660 --> 01:37:32,788
Promise me, that whenever I get confused
you will make me underrated?

1383
01:37:32,997 --> 01:37:33,463
Promise.

1384
01:37:33,664 --> 01:37:38,465
Promise me that every day you will love me
the way you are loving me right now?

1385
01:37:38,669 --> 01:37:39,465
Promise.

1386
01:37:39,670 --> 01:37:42,969
Promise me that you will
never look at other girls?

1387
01:37:43,173 --> 01:37:44,140
Ok where are we going now?

1388
01:37:46,510 --> 01:37:49,138
Ok ask me. - What?

1389
01:37:50,014 --> 01:37:51,311
Just do it!

1390
01:37:57,688 --> 01:38:00,816
Nikki Bakshi will you marry me?

1391
01:38:02,359 --> 01:38:02,984
Yes

1392
01:38:05,029 --> 01:38:07,657
Cool, so... shall we... kiss.

1393
01:38:07,865 --> 01:38:08,490
No

1394
01:38:09,533 --> 01:38:11,000
Good. Even I don't want to

1395
01:38:11,201 --> 01:38:12,668
Good. - Good.

1396
01:38:12,870 --> 01:38:14,337
Fine. - Fine, see you at the wedding then

1397
01:38:14,538 --> 01:38:16,005
Ok. - Bye. - Bye.

1398
