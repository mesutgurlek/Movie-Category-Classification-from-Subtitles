1
00:01:42,291 --> 00:01:43,783
Where are we heading for?

2
00:01:43,998 --> 00:01:46,072
Wide open spaces
where men are men.

3
00:01:46,289 --> 00:01:47,911
And the women?
No women!

4
00:01:48,122 --> 00:01:49,235
That's how we got into this thing.

5
00:01:49,455 --> 00:01:51,326
Yike!

6
00:01:51,537 --> 00:01:54,239
Head south, boy!
It's gonna be a cold winter.

7
00:01:54,454 --> 00:01:56,574
What do you say we book
our act around here?

8
00:01:56,785 --> 00:02:00,564
Good idea. No girls anywhere
as pretty as the girls in Oklahoma.

9
00:02:00,784 --> 00:02:01,779
Pa! Pa!

10
00:02:02,992 --> 00:02:05,396
But he sung so pretty.

11
00:02:05,616 --> 00:02:08,234
I'll get him if it's
the last thing I do.

12
00:02:08,449 --> 00:02:10,403
What did he tell you
his name was?

13
00:02:10,614 --> 00:02:11,775
Frank Sinatra.

14
00:02:14,238 --> 00:02:16,560
Hey, Scat? How about playing
some dates in Texas?

15
00:02:16,779 --> 00:02:20,357
Now you're talking. No girls anywhere
as pretty as the girls in Texas.

16
00:02:26,609 --> 00:02:28,231
I reckon
we lost them, Buck.

17
00:02:28,442 --> 00:02:30,764
Yeah, but they're gonna be
mighty easy to track down.

18
00:02:30,983 --> 00:02:34,181
One of them told my little
sister his name was Gene Autry.

19
00:02:35,897 --> 00:02:36,892
Louisiana!

20
00:02:37,106 --> 00:02:39,226
No girls anywhere
pretty as the girls...

21
00:02:39,438 --> 00:02:42,600
No, you don't! We're gonna stay
right here and get ourselves a job.

22
00:02:49,476 --> 00:02:50,471
Yoo-hoo!

23
00:02:50,684 --> 00:02:52,591
I know: " Don't phone us,
we'll phone you."

24
00:02:52,809 --> 00:02:56,505
Don't race your motor, I booked a date
for us. We're gonna be eating again.

25
00:02:56,724 --> 00:02:59,046
Good news for the mice. No we
can quit stealing their cheese.

26
00:02:59,265 --> 00:03:00,638
I'm so hungry,
my pucker won't puck.

27
00:03:00,848 --> 00:03:02,304
My waistline was practically
back to normal.

28
00:03:02,514 --> 00:03:03,508
Which one?
Where we playing?

29
00:03:03,722 --> 00:03:06,719
Johnson's Mammoth Carnival.
Oh, the seals couldn't make it, huh?

30
00:03:06,929 --> 00:03:11,632
What a setup! We sing, we dance, we
recite, and then you do your specialty.

31
00:03:11,844 --> 00:03:13,123
Oh, I'll blow them
out of the joint.

32
00:03:13,343 --> 00:03:15,416
Well, this is a little different.
This is a novelty act.

33
00:03:15,634 --> 00:03:16,877
What kind of novelty?

34
00:03:17,092 --> 00:03:18,632
All you have to do
is ride a bicycle.

35
00:03:18,842 --> 00:03:21,376
What kind of bicycle?
Oh, a regulation bicycle.

36
00:03:21,590 --> 00:03:25,583
Standard equipment. Oxyacetylene
lamp, a new departure coaster breaker.

37
00:03:25,798 --> 00:03:27,788
Do I ride it fast?
The slower the better.

38
00:03:28,006 --> 00:03:30,161
No hands, huh?
That's entirely up to you.

39
00:03:30,379 --> 00:03:32,832
Well, pack up your bugle.
Let's fly from this fleabag.

40
00:03:33,045 --> 00:03:35,201
Lucky our laundry came back.

41
00:03:35,420 --> 00:03:38,582
This time I'll take the money so some
gal won't tear it out of you with tears.

42
00:03:38,793 --> 00:03:41,909
No more. Heart of stone,
that's me! Come along!

43
00:03:44,375 --> 00:03:45,369
What is this?

44
00:03:45,583 --> 00:03:48,035
Don't want to wake up the
desk clerk. Come along.

45
00:04:09,867 --> 00:04:14,901
"We're full of glee My buddy and
me We're happy all day through"

46
00:04:15,115 --> 00:04:19,652
"You'll always see us Laughing ha!
like little boys We're so full of joys"

47
00:04:19,863 --> 00:04:23,358
"But that's why we say to you"

48
00:04:23,570 --> 00:04:25,892
"We're on our way"

49
00:04:26,111 --> 00:04:29,806
"To Apalachicola Bay"

50
00:04:30,026 --> 00:04:32,692
Tell me, where's Apalachicola?
Clever town, down south.

51
00:04:32,900 --> 00:04:34,890
Down south? What are we
wearing this long underwear for?

52
00:04:35,108 --> 00:04:36,766
Because we're quite a target.

53
00:04:36,983 --> 00:04:40,015
"Magnolia trees and possum
And a pretty southern gal"

54
00:04:40,231 --> 00:04:44,093
"It's better than the orange groves
In Cucamonga, Cal"

55
00:04:44,313 --> 00:04:50,094
"We're gonna stay
Along the Apalachicola Bay"

56
00:04:50,311 --> 00:04:53,758
"We may stop in Old Cliff Corner
For some ham and grits"

57
00:04:53,977 --> 00:04:57,590
"Or pass through Tallahassee
If the weather permits"

58
00:04:57,809 --> 00:05:00,640
"We're on our way"

59
00:05:00,850 --> 00:05:04,510
"To Apalachicola, F-L-A"

60
00:05:07,347 --> 00:05:11,387
"Way down upon the Swanee"

61
00:05:11,595 --> 00:05:16,085
"The Swanee River"

62
00:05:16,302 --> 00:05:19,299
Swanee!
Oh, that old Swanee!

63
00:05:19,510 --> 00:05:21,583
I can't wait to get down there.

64
00:05:21,801 --> 00:05:25,331
See my little old mammy with that
load of cotton coming up the road.

65
00:05:25,550 --> 00:05:27,670
And there's my sweet old pappy.

66
00:05:27,882 --> 00:05:29,872
He's always got a load.

67
00:05:30,090 --> 00:05:32,163
Oh, and that Confederate moonlight

68
00:05:32,381 --> 00:05:36,289
shines down and makes
those stills look so swanky.

69
00:05:36,504 --> 00:05:39,287
And that Thanksgiving dinner, hmph.

70
00:05:39,503 --> 00:05:41,328
When they barbecue a Yankee.

71
00:05:41,544 --> 00:05:43,036
Yak-yak-yak-yak-yak.

72
00:05:44,460 --> 00:05:47,741
"Carry me back"

73
00:05:47,959 --> 00:05:52,449
"To old Virginny"

74
00:05:52,666 --> 00:05:54,952
Virginny. Ow!

75
00:05:57,081 --> 00:06:00,659
The path to the schoolhouse
down which I would wind

76
00:06:00,871 --> 00:06:05,822
with my little bitty old ball weevil
trudging behind.

77
00:06:06,036 --> 00:06:08,109
Come along, Ball. Come on.

78
00:06:08,327 --> 00:06:11,940
My pa bet on horses
that always ran fourth,

79
00:06:12,159 --> 00:06:16,400
so Ma rented cabins
to the folks from up north.

80
00:06:17,782 --> 00:06:21,147
Apalachicola, I hear you calling!
Apalachicola!

81
00:06:22,114 --> 00:06:25,064
"I'm on my way"
"Well, let's go!"

82
00:07:00,601 --> 00:07:03,764
"We're on our way to..."

83
00:07:04,808 --> 00:07:08,220
"Apalachicola
Apalachicola"

84
00:07:08,431 --> 00:07:10,884
"Apalachicola
Apalachicola"

85
00:07:11,098 --> 00:07:13,502
"Apalachicola
Apalachicola"

86
00:07:13,721 --> 00:07:15,960
"Apalachicola
Apalachicola"

87
00:07:16,179 --> 00:07:18,299
Whoo! Whoo!

88
00:07:21,219 --> 00:07:22,841
Whoo! Whoo!

89
00:07:45,628 --> 00:07:49,951
More? We're killing them.
Shall I tap them with an encore?

90
00:07:50,168 --> 00:07:52,833
No. It's time now for the
topper, your novelty act.

91
00:07:53,042 --> 00:07:55,659
Thank you, ladies and gentlemen.
Thank you, you fools!

92
00:07:58,040 --> 00:08:01,405
Hmm, thank you, you doll.
Don't leave the grounds.

93
00:08:02,830 --> 00:08:05,863
Here, here. Get dressed!
Warm them up.

94
00:08:06,080 --> 00:08:07,192
Oh, Mr. Johnson!

95
00:08:09,495 --> 00:08:11,983
Our contractual
obligation, hmm?

96
00:08:12,202 --> 00:08:14,951
I hope your partner does
better than the Great Sandar.

97
00:08:15,159 --> 00:08:17,825
He'll be in the hospital
for at least six months.

98
00:08:18,034 --> 00:08:20,355
Yes, well, don't you worry
about Barton the Magnificent.

99
00:08:20,574 --> 00:08:22,943
He'll give you a good show
if it kills him.

100
00:08:23,157 --> 00:08:24,318
Hurry, hurry, hurry!

101
00:08:24,532 --> 00:08:26,072
You made a good deal,
Mr. Johnson.

102
00:08:26,281 --> 00:08:27,275
Psst!

103
00:08:32,029 --> 00:08:33,853
Does Notre Dame
know about this boy?

104
00:08:34,070 --> 00:08:37,600
A little insurance. He'll see that
your partner doesn't get cold feet.

105
00:08:39,443 --> 00:08:41,268
Too late!

106
00:08:44,691 --> 00:08:46,895
Shall we, then?
What a build.

107
00:08:47,107 --> 00:08:48,683
You think Superman will sue?

108
00:08:48,898 --> 00:08:50,604
Just as I thought, falsies.

109
00:08:50,814 --> 00:08:52,638
Falsies? You kidding?
That's real flab.

110
00:08:52,855 --> 00:08:53,969
What's this for?

111
00:08:54,188 --> 00:08:56,343
I'm gonna play a fast chorus of
"Dinah" while I'm riding the bike...

112
00:08:56,562 --> 00:08:58,718
Oh, no.
Just whistle it, kid.

113
00:08:58,937 --> 00:09:01,092
My bread!
lt'll be all right, don't worry.

114
00:09:01,311 --> 00:09:03,716
Come along. Here we go! Hup!

115
00:09:03,935 --> 00:09:06,636
Up here?
Yes, sir! Hey!

116
00:09:08,017 --> 00:09:10,386
Hey, wait a minute! Where am
I going? Why am I climbing?

117
00:09:10,599 --> 00:09:12,802
Your bicycle's up there.
My...?

118
00:09:16,181 --> 00:09:17,507
You want me
to ride that thing?

119
00:09:17,722 --> 00:09:20,968
Up there in the stratosphere?
Who do you think I am? Mr. Jordan?

120
00:09:21,179 --> 00:09:23,134
Up that ladder!

121
00:09:23,345 --> 00:09:24,967
How did Mount Baldy
get into this?

122
00:09:25,178 --> 00:09:26,208
Up that ladder!

123
00:09:26,427 --> 00:09:28,631
Get yourself an eagle,
brother! Wait a minute!

124
00:09:28,843 --> 00:09:31,296
What is this? What kind
of...? Wait a minute, please!

125
00:09:31,509 --> 00:09:34,541
I can't stand altitude.
I get dizzy spells.

126
00:09:34,758 --> 00:09:38,170
Wait a minute! Not too
high, my nose will bleed!

127
00:09:38,381 --> 00:09:41,048
Wait! I may hatch this, you know!

128
00:09:41,255 --> 00:09:44,620
Take it easy. We're getting
200 bucks for this. See?

129
00:09:44,838 --> 00:09:48,000
Well, let me hold it. If anything
goes wrong, at least I won't die poor!

130
00:09:48,212 --> 00:09:50,367
You can trust me, boy.
I'll take care of your dough.

131
00:09:54,418 --> 00:09:57,415
You'll take care of it, all right,
until some dame comes along.

132
00:09:57,626 --> 00:10:02,032
All they have to do is tell you the sad story of
their life and you wanna give it a happy ending!

133
00:10:04,123 --> 00:10:06,611
Steady now,
I'm getting ice on my ears!

134
00:10:07,789 --> 00:10:08,985
Don't push, we're here.

135
00:10:14,828 --> 00:10:16,948
Ladies and gentlemen...

136
00:10:17,161 --> 00:10:19,944
I have to go down,
I forgot my rosin.

137
00:10:20,160 --> 00:10:22,114
Your attention, please!

138
00:10:22,326 --> 00:10:26,863
Barton the Magnificent will
now perform a sensational...

139
00:10:28,282 --> 00:10:31,895
- an aerial feat:
The Ride Through Space!

140
00:10:32,114 --> 00:10:33,606
What's your problem, honey?

141
00:10:33,821 --> 00:10:36,902
I'm in trouble.
Big trouble.

142
00:10:37,112 --> 00:10:39,316
Oh, there, there.

143
00:10:39,528 --> 00:10:42,312
Well, just tell old Scat all about it.

144
00:10:42,527 --> 00:10:45,275
Please! I'd like to talk it over a second.

145
00:10:45,485 --> 00:10:46,858
Just one second! Please!

146
00:10:47,068 --> 00:10:49,981
nerves of steel!

147
00:10:50,191 --> 00:10:53,556
Introducing Barton the Magnificent,

148
00:10:53,774 --> 00:10:56,308
substituting for Sandar,

149
00:10:56,522 --> 00:11:01,972
who, unfortunately broke his leg
this afternoon.

150
00:11:02,187 --> 00:11:04,426
Just a sec! I'm not getting enough money!

151
00:11:04,645 --> 00:11:07,926
Whoa! Whoa!
Please! Please!

152
00:11:09,893 --> 00:11:11,848
Wait! Wait a minute! Whoa!

153
00:11:16,099 --> 00:11:17,722
Whoa! Whoa!

154
00:11:21,889 --> 00:11:24,672
I did it! I did it!
Oh, no, you don't!

155
00:11:24,888 --> 00:11:26,760
Just one show!
Oh, no!

156
00:11:26,970 --> 00:11:29,920
Please, it's windy out there!
Please! Don't!

157
00:11:31,345 --> 00:11:32,588
Where'd you go?

158
00:11:34,468 --> 00:11:37,038
Aaargh! Oh, please!

159
00:11:43,090 --> 00:11:45,660
Help! Help!

160
00:11:45,881 --> 00:11:46,876
Help!

161
00:11:48,213 --> 00:11:51,460
Help! Help! Help!

162
00:11:51,670 --> 00:11:53,625
You know, this picture
could end right here.

163
00:11:53,837 --> 00:11:57,876
Scat! Do something, you burglar!
Lay your coat down! Help!

164
00:11:59,876 --> 00:12:02,908
Hang on, pal.
Old Scat will take care of you.

165
00:12:05,750 --> 00:12:07,242
Tilt!

166
00:12:31,574 --> 00:12:35,567
Hey! Don't let that wagon
get away from you, now! Giddap!

167
00:12:42,196 --> 00:12:44,269
Whoa!
Attaboy!

168
00:12:48,610 --> 00:12:52,305
See you at the Derby.
You'll be glue if you talk to him.

169
00:13:12,102 --> 00:13:15,432
"Queen of Brazil."
Ha-ha!

170
00:13:15,642 --> 00:13:17,965
No girls anywhere as pretty
as the girls in Brazil.

171
00:13:22,016 --> 00:13:23,011
Oh!

172
00:13:42,301 --> 00:13:44,337
Don't beat their heads in
till I get my money back.

173
00:13:44,550 --> 00:13:47,914
You can break his legs, but don't
tear the tights, they belong to me.

174
00:13:48,132 --> 00:13:49,624
Come on, let's find him.

175
00:13:49,840 --> 00:13:51,913
Watch your step, folks.

176
00:13:52,672 --> 00:13:54,045
Step carefully, please.

177
00:14:06,751 --> 00:14:07,745
Watch your step!

178
00:14:11,624 --> 00:14:12,618
Snap it up!

179
00:14:21,037 --> 00:14:25,161
This is a Texas steer.
He's still kicking a little.

180
00:14:39,865 --> 00:14:43,146
Hey, where are you going?
Put it on the block!

181
00:14:47,112 --> 00:14:49,896
Any more?
That's it, matey. Close her up!

182
00:14:50,111 --> 00:14:51,484
Okay!

183
00:14:52,153 --> 00:14:54,604
Don't go away.
I'll be right back.

184
00:15:16,269 --> 00:15:17,264
Hot Lips?

185
00:15:18,144 --> 00:15:19,138
Psst!

186
00:15:19,351 --> 00:15:20,346
Hot Lips?

187
00:15:20,560 --> 00:15:22,466
Let me hear from you!

188
00:15:22,684 --> 00:15:23,927
Hot Lips? Psst!

189
00:15:32,556 --> 00:15:34,676
Well, I'm getting warm.
That's ham.

190
00:15:34,888 --> 00:15:36,345
Hot Lips!

191
00:16:00,713 --> 00:16:02,253
Huh? Huh?

192
00:16:05,752 --> 00:16:08,833
Quiet, quiet. You sound like a typewriter.

193
00:16:09,043 --> 00:16:10,536
How do you feel?
Huh?

194
00:16:10,751 --> 00:16:13,535
Like a popsicle.
Where are we?

195
00:16:13,750 --> 00:16:15,989
I'll get you a spot of tea.
Come on.

196
00:16:16,207 --> 00:16:18,446
What I need is a blowtorch.

197
00:16:19,665 --> 00:16:22,070
You look like an ad for
Kool Cigarettes. Come on.

198
00:16:22,289 --> 00:16:23,697
So long, fellas.

199
00:16:23,913 --> 00:16:26,580
Where are we? What happened? Who was it?

200
00:16:27,870 --> 00:16:30,323
Hurry. This is bad
for my throat.

201
00:16:30,536 --> 00:16:31,531
Oh, oh.

202
00:16:34,867 --> 00:16:36,277
Come on, I'm getting cold.

203
00:16:43,740 --> 00:16:46,144
What happens now?
Everything's all fixed, penguin.

204
00:16:46,364 --> 00:16:49,563
Wait till you see the cosy little hideaway
I found for us. A lifeboat built for two.

205
00:16:49,780 --> 00:16:52,481
All I wanna do is curl up
in a nice warm stove.

206
00:16:55,111 --> 00:16:57,314
Huh?
Hey, in here!

207
00:17:31,724 --> 00:17:33,429
Come in!

208
00:17:45,511 --> 00:17:48,840
Your suits, gentlemen.
But just a minute.

209
00:17:49,051 --> 00:17:50,331
Where are
the other two?

210
00:17:50,551 --> 00:17:55,005
Why, I really don't know,
sir. I had them when I left.

211
00:17:55,216 --> 00:17:57,207
Would you please try
to find those suits?

212
00:17:57,423 --> 00:17:59,958
We'll be terribly
inconvenienced without them.

213
00:18:00,173 --> 00:18:03,004
You wouldn't want us
to be inconvenienced.

214
00:18:07,795 --> 00:18:09,832
Those suits
were tailor-made.

215
00:18:10,044 --> 00:18:11,951
We're very fond
of them.

216
00:18:13,127 --> 00:18:14,454
We'd better
get them back...

217
00:18:14,668 --> 00:18:15,865
Harry!

218
00:18:17,084 --> 00:18:18,493
That'll be all, thank you.

219
00:18:37,743 --> 00:18:41,155
I'll tell you when
to get tough with people.

220
00:18:41,368 --> 00:18:43,654
You're working for me, Harry,

221
00:18:43,866 --> 00:18:48,855
and I've too much at stake to have
it spoiled by your hoodlum tactics.

222
00:18:49,073 --> 00:18:52,189
Is that clear?
Right, Mrs. Vail.

223
00:18:53,571 --> 00:18:55,313
Come with me.

224
00:18:55,530 --> 00:18:57,519
I can't find Lucia.

225
00:19:04,443 --> 00:19:06,930
Right, now we can see.
Yeah, I've seen enough of you.

226
00:19:07,150 --> 00:19:08,690
Here, give me that.
Burn that man's suit.

227
00:19:08,900 --> 00:19:11,139
I'd like to defrost my goose
pimples, if you don't mind.

228
00:19:11,358 --> 00:19:14,638
Isn't this great? We got the housing
shortage beat. We got our own lifeboat.

229
00:19:14,856 --> 00:19:16,397
If the boat sinks,
we're sitting pretty.

230
00:19:16,606 --> 00:19:18,228
We got the jump on
the women and children.

231
00:19:18,438 --> 00:19:20,807
You couldn't get me a trap like
this nearer the boiler room?

232
00:19:21,021 --> 00:19:23,260
I don't want you down there.
I like heat!

233
00:19:23,478 --> 00:19:24,935
I'd like to hear
from my blood again.

234
00:19:25,144 --> 00:19:28,592
I want you up on deck where it's healthy,
where you can breathe that good, deep salt air.

235
00:19:28,810 --> 00:19:31,179
You're salty enough for me,
getting me in these nooks.

236
00:19:31,393 --> 00:19:33,134
Because you give my money to those dames!

237
00:19:33,350 --> 00:19:35,885
May I give you one small piece
of chitchat for your files?

238
00:19:36,100 --> 00:19:40,305
If the most beautiful woman in the world walked
by, know what I'd do? Give her the full fuller.

239
00:19:40,515 --> 00:19:43,002
I'd give her the brush.

240
00:19:43,222 --> 00:19:44,880
Do you hear that?
What's that?

241
00:19:45,097 --> 00:19:47,133
Come on.
Who's there?

242
00:20:00,924 --> 00:20:03,673
It's just a dame.
She's crying. Maybe I can help her.

243
00:20:03,881 --> 00:20:06,630
Don't bother. She's old
enough to blow her own nose.

244
00:20:06,880 --> 00:20:07,875
Wait a minute.

245
00:20:08,089 --> 00:20:11,002
You gave me your word of honour, your
scout's oath and you crossed your heart.

246
00:20:11,213 --> 00:20:12,409
That's a tough
parlay to buck.

247
00:20:12,629 --> 00:20:14,702
But those are real tears.
This dame's different.

248
00:20:20,459 --> 00:20:21,951
Here, now, here!

249
00:20:22,167 --> 00:20:24,489
No, let me go!
Here! Here, now!

250
00:20:24,708 --> 00:20:27,160
You don't wanna do that. That
water's pretty cold out there.

251
00:20:27,374 --> 00:20:29,826
Hey, let's get back. You
wanna get caught? Come on!

252
00:20:30,040 --> 00:20:31,697
I said, let me go!

253
00:20:31,914 --> 00:20:33,903
Let her go. Maybe she
wants to rinse a few things.

254
00:20:34,121 --> 00:20:36,444
You're loaded, you've got
everything to live for.

255
00:20:36,663 --> 00:20:39,150
Yeah, she's loaded, but remember
Oklahoma, Texas, New Orleans?

256
00:20:39,370 --> 00:20:41,325
I'll help you jump.
Now come here!

257
00:20:41,535 --> 00:20:44,616
Get back in the nook,
schnook. Go on! Hey, whoa!

258
00:20:45,618 --> 00:20:47,442
Wait a minute, I just thought of something.

259
00:20:47,659 --> 00:20:50,277
If you jump, you'll get us into trouble.

260
00:20:50,491 --> 00:20:53,737
We got all
we can handle now.

261
00:20:53,949 --> 00:20:55,985
I'm sorry.
I'll go back to my cabin.

262
00:20:56,198 --> 00:20:59,278
Go back to your cabin and shoot
yourself. That way, nobody will get hurt.

263
00:20:59,488 --> 00:21:02,687
Make it very quiet. A little
killing... Take it easy.

264
00:21:04,070 --> 00:21:06,106
Who are those men
with Lucia?

265
00:21:06,319 --> 00:21:08,854
I don't know. But there's
something familiar about them.

266
00:21:09,068 --> 00:21:11,520
There should be.
They're wearing our suits.

267
00:21:11,734 --> 00:21:12,729
Shh!

268
00:21:14,691 --> 00:21:17,605
You'll thank me later
for interfering.

269
00:21:17,815 --> 00:21:20,647
I can thank you now, Mr...?
Sweeney. Scat Sweeney.

270
00:21:20,856 --> 00:21:23,012
My name is
Lucia Maria de Andrade.

271
00:21:23,231 --> 00:21:26,144
And I'm Hot Lips Barton. Okay,
introduction's over. Let's spread out.

272
00:21:26,354 --> 00:21:28,758
Wait a minute.
Wait, don't push me, pappy.

273
00:21:28,978 --> 00:21:31,015
This kid's in a lot of trouble.
We gotta take things easy.

274
00:21:31,228 --> 00:21:33,893
Will you give her the brush?
Scout's honour.

275
00:21:34,101 --> 00:21:35,973
Okay. So long, kid.

276
00:21:36,184 --> 00:21:39,383
And don't tell him any sad
stories, because we're cleaned out.

277
00:21:39,600 --> 00:21:41,009
Haven't got to eat.

278
00:21:41,225 --> 00:21:42,681
Stowaways, third class.

279
00:21:46,056 --> 00:21:47,631
Stowaways...

280
00:21:50,763 --> 00:21:54,625
Why do you wanna take that long, wet
leap? A gorgeous gal like yourself?

281
00:21:54,844 --> 00:21:56,172
I don't know.

282
00:21:56,385 --> 00:21:59,750
I'm worried and confused.
I just don't know.

283
00:21:59,968 --> 00:22:02,502
Couldn't a man, could it?
No.

284
00:22:02,717 --> 00:22:04,090
Yes, I suppose so.

285
00:22:04,300 --> 00:22:06,290
Oh, I get it.
All men are rats...

286
00:22:06,508 --> 00:22:07,537
No!

287
00:22:07,757 --> 00:22:09,463
No, it isn't that at all.

288
00:22:09,673 --> 00:22:13,251
I love Sherman.
He's gonna meet me in Rio.

289
00:22:13,464 --> 00:22:16,377
We'll be married. We'll be
happy, we'll be very happy.

290
00:22:16,587 --> 00:22:18,293
Wait, wait.
Who's Sherman?

291
00:22:18,504 --> 00:22:21,169
He's my Aunt Catherine's brother.
Your uncle?

292
00:22:21,377 --> 00:22:22,372
No.

293
00:22:22,585 --> 00:22:25,831
He... You see, she's not really
my aunt. She's my guardian.

294
00:22:26,043 --> 00:22:28,116
Well, does she know about...?
Oh, no!

295
00:22:28,334 --> 00:22:32,196
If she ever found out what I tried
to do tonight, she'd be heartbroken.

296
00:22:32,415 --> 00:22:34,535
She's a wonderful woman.

297
00:22:34,748 --> 00:22:36,655
Well, now we're both confused.

298
00:22:36,872 --> 00:22:38,910
You're not in love with this fella.
You couldn't be.

299
00:22:39,121 --> 00:22:41,325
Girls don't go around cutting
themselves in with the porpoises

300
00:22:41,537 --> 00:22:44,700
when they're gonna marry the fella they
love. That doesn't make any sense at all.

301
00:22:44,912 --> 00:22:48,026
No. Nothing
makes sense lately.

302
00:22:48,243 --> 00:22:51,359
Every time I make up my mind
to do something, I change it,

303
00:22:51,576 --> 00:22:54,145
just as though I had
no will of my own.

304
00:22:54,367 --> 00:23:00,148
There are hours, days even, when I
just don't remember what's happened.

305
00:23:00,365 --> 00:23:03,729
I know what you're thinking, Mr.
Sweeney, and maybe you're right.

306
00:23:03,946 --> 00:23:06,648
Wait a minute. Don't you
tell me what I'm thinking.

307
00:23:06,862 --> 00:23:10,393
You're just as normal as I am,
if that's any consolation to you.

308
00:23:10,611 --> 00:23:12,684
But you gotta pull
yourself together, honey.

309
00:23:47,515 --> 00:23:48,510
Well!

310
00:23:49,514 --> 00:23:51,718
Free movies!
Isn't this pleasant?

311
00:23:51,930 --> 00:23:53,471
Outdoors and everything.

312
00:23:54,638 --> 00:23:57,470
Do you mind sitting
here on the balcony?

313
00:23:59,178 --> 00:24:01,417
I wonder what
we're running tonight.

314
00:24:06,925 --> 00:24:09,295
Say, look, honey.
Hey, psst!

315
00:24:10,175 --> 00:24:12,922
You're going through a tough time
and you're letting it get you.

316
00:24:13,132 --> 00:24:15,963
That's no way
to handle trouble.

317
00:24:16,173 --> 00:24:18,660
Look at Max and Gertrude
up there on the screen.

318
00:24:18,880 --> 00:24:22,374
Her lease is up, he's got a big
hangover and her feet are killing her,

319
00:24:22,587 --> 00:24:25,253
but there they are up there,
floating through the air

320
00:24:25,461 --> 00:24:27,949
as if they didn't have
a care in the world.

321
00:24:28,169 --> 00:24:30,916
How do you know all this?
Watch the next shot.

322
00:24:35,999 --> 00:24:38,073
Why, Mr. Sweeney,
that's you and your friend.

323
00:24:38,290 --> 00:24:39,368
That's right.

324
00:24:39,582 --> 00:24:41,903
We stopped off in Hollywood
for a few days,

325
00:24:42,122 --> 00:24:45,238
and stole a couple of dollars
doing extra work.

326
00:24:46,662 --> 00:24:49,825
Old Hot Lips, he's really
hamming it up, isn't he?

327
00:25:03,115 --> 00:25:05,520
But getting back
to Max and Gertrude,

328
00:25:05,740 --> 00:25:08,108
you'd think he was madly
in love with her, wouldn't you?

329
00:25:08,322 --> 00:25:11,851
Now, I'll tell you something, the
boy has a redhead in Jersey City.

330
00:25:12,070 --> 00:25:13,693
Mad about her.

331
00:25:13,904 --> 00:25:16,854
You'd think she was in
love with him. She's not.

332
00:25:17,068 --> 00:25:18,063
Watch this.

333
00:25:21,151 --> 00:25:24,231
He thinks she's in love
with him. Watch this here.

334
00:25:31,064 --> 00:25:35,222
Loves to show his teeth. You can't blame
him, though. They cost him a pretty penny.

335
00:25:36,438 --> 00:25:38,641
You see?
No use worrying.

336
00:25:39,936 --> 00:25:42,850
"Love is funny"

337
00:25:43,060 --> 00:25:45,678
"Or it's sad"

338
00:25:45,893 --> 00:25:48,463
"Or it's quiet"

339
00:25:48,683 --> 00:25:51,515
"Or it's mad"

340
00:25:51,724 --> 00:25:54,046
"It's a good thing"

341
00:25:54,265 --> 00:25:56,753
"Or it's bad"

342
00:25:56,972 --> 00:26:00,004
"But beautiful"

343
00:26:02,220 --> 00:26:07,255
"Beautiful
To take a chance"

344
00:26:07,469 --> 00:26:13,085
"And if you fall
You fall"

345
00:26:13,300 --> 00:26:21,581
"And I'm thinking
I wouldn't mind at all"

346
00:26:24,671 --> 00:26:30,453
"Love is tearful
Or it's gay"

347
00:26:30,669 --> 00:26:36,083
"It's a problem
Or it's play"

348
00:26:36,293 --> 00:26:41,707
"It's a heartache
Either way"

349
00:26:41,915 --> 00:26:45,031
"But beautiful"

350
00:26:46,997 --> 00:26:50,740
"And I'm thinking"

351
00:26:50,954 --> 00:26:57,778
"If you were mine
I'd never let you go"

352
00:26:58,660 --> 00:27:03,481
"And that would be"

353
00:27:03,700 --> 00:27:12,231
"But beautiful I know"

354
00:27:35,106 --> 00:27:38,435
Ah, you happy little Grable bait.

355
00:27:38,647 --> 00:27:41,644
Come on in. What happened?
Did you brush her off?

356
00:27:41,854 --> 00:27:43,974
Or do I have to learn how to
say "not guilty" in Portuguese?

357
00:27:44,186 --> 00:27:45,560
This girl's in trouble, boy.

358
00:27:45,769 --> 00:27:48,802
Big trouble, big! She's in a worse
jam than that girl in Bridgeport.

359
00:27:49,019 --> 00:27:51,422
Bridgeport? You mean the
wife of that sword-swallower?

360
00:27:51,642 --> 00:27:53,964
Chased us six blocks,
burping daggers all the way?

361
00:27:54,183 --> 00:27:56,007
Don't go again,
please, please.

362
00:28:19,758 --> 00:28:20,752
Lucia?

363
00:28:22,382 --> 00:28:23,377
Lucia?

364
00:28:24,132 --> 00:28:25,125
Are you asleep?

365
00:28:28,213 --> 00:28:30,168
Listen closely, child.

366
00:28:35,378 --> 00:28:37,249
You love Sherman.

367
00:28:39,543 --> 00:28:42,245
I love Sherman.

368
00:28:43,584 --> 00:28:45,538
Those two men you met tonight,

369
00:28:46,416 --> 00:28:47,908
they're stowaways.

370
00:28:50,290 --> 00:28:52,244
They're stowaways.

371
00:28:52,455 --> 00:28:54,575
They should be reported.

372
00:28:55,788 --> 00:28:58,027
They should be reported.

373
00:28:58,245 --> 00:29:00,034
You hate them.

374
00:29:00,245 --> 00:29:01,902
You loathe them.

375
00:29:02,119 --> 00:29:03,694
You despise them.

376
00:29:05,410 --> 00:29:07,897
I hate them.

377
00:29:08,117 --> 00:29:10,735
I loathe them.

378
00:29:10,949 --> 00:29:13,023
I despise them.

379
00:29:15,115 --> 00:29:16,488
Sleep, child.

380
00:29:18,405 --> 00:29:19,400
Sleep.

381
00:29:31,442 --> 00:29:33,397
Yes! How do you...?

382
00:29:33,608 --> 00:29:36,096
You like sugar on your ketchup?
Nice grab, a bottle of blood.

383
00:29:36,315 --> 00:29:38,520
No toothpicks, even.
I'm gonna eat a shoe.

384
00:29:38,731 --> 00:29:41,136
Hey, don't snap your cap. Come
on, we'll get something solid.

385
00:29:41,356 --> 00:29:44,223
Wait. I can't go out there in
this costume, they'll pick me up.

386
00:29:44,438 --> 00:29:46,475
Which is a switch.
That's right.

387
00:29:46,688 --> 00:29:49,471
Let us be inventive, egghead.
We take your leotard...

388
00:29:49,687 --> 00:29:51,557
Steady now.
Open your coat.

389
00:29:51,769 --> 00:29:53,806
Will it fit this high?
You'll be a smash on the deck.

390
00:29:54,018 --> 00:29:57,513
You'll look like Lord Puffingwell
out for his bracer in the morning.

391
00:29:57,725 --> 00:30:00,473
That's jolly, isn't it?
There you are.

392
00:30:00,683 --> 00:30:01,843
Oh, that's grand.

393
00:30:02,057 --> 00:30:04,759
Put a bottle of tiger sweat in my
hand and I'm a man of distinction.

394
00:30:04,973 --> 00:30:09,096
Will you join me in a bloater?
Lead, old boy. Thank you.

395
00:30:10,513 --> 00:30:12,135
There you are, Mr. Stanton.

396
00:30:17,177 --> 00:30:19,546
Anything else, sir?
That's all.

397
00:30:23,467 --> 00:30:25,504
How do you do?
How are you?

398
00:30:25,716 --> 00:30:26,995
Starting to kick up a bit.

399
00:30:27,216 --> 00:30:30,331
Keep a stiff upper. It always gets
choppy through the Gulf Stream.

400
00:30:30,548 --> 00:30:32,537
I clearly remember
the last trip.

401
00:30:32,755 --> 00:30:35,836
I understand at that time the
ship did a complete somersault.

402
00:30:36,046 --> 00:30:37,586
Oh, yes.

403
00:30:38,045 --> 00:30:41,042
Lost my wife, you know?
Oh, lucky fellow! Lucky fellow!

404
00:30:41,253 --> 00:30:43,953
Will you join me in a spot
of breakfast, maybe a waffle?

405
00:30:44,168 --> 00:30:47,864
Shall we, then? That
titillates my gastric juices.

406
00:30:48,084 --> 00:30:51,081
My stomach is drooling
too, you know.

407
00:30:51,290 --> 00:30:53,909
Maple syrup, honey?
Nice thick maple syrup.

408
00:30:54,124 --> 00:30:57,404
Yes, and maybe a piece of ham.
Nice thick greasy ham.

409
00:30:57,622 --> 00:31:00,738
With a little bit of fatback.
And some banana cream pie.

410
00:31:00,955 --> 00:31:03,276
Yum-yum-yummy!
Absolutely wizard!

411
00:31:03,495 --> 00:31:06,030
That sounds like a breakfast
fit for a fat old king.

412
00:31:06,244 --> 00:31:08,400
Waffles, maple syrup
and ham!

413
00:31:08,618 --> 00:31:10,490
Maybe some onion soup.
And whipped cream.

414
00:31:10,701 --> 00:31:12,905
Excuse me!
Tilt, old boy.

415
00:31:16,199 --> 00:31:17,525
Dig in, pal.

416
00:31:18,865 --> 00:31:20,736
Come on, come on.
What's the matter?

417
00:31:20,948 --> 00:31:22,937
You shouldn't have
mentioned that onion soup.

418
00:31:23,155 --> 00:31:24,612
You weak-stomached people!

419
00:31:24,822 --> 00:31:27,439
I come from a long
line of seafaring...

420
00:31:41,066 --> 00:31:43,102
Okay, boys.
Let's find them.

421
00:31:44,190 --> 00:31:46,595
Seems to have calmed
down a bit, huh?

422
00:31:46,814 --> 00:31:47,975
Not for me, it hasn't.

423
00:31:48,271 --> 00:31:49,266
There's Lucia.

424
00:31:51,105 --> 00:31:54,055
Hello, honey.
I see she brought a friend for you.

425
00:31:54,269 --> 00:31:55,845
How are you
feeling today?

426
00:31:56,061 --> 00:31:57,222
I hate you.

427
00:31:57,435 --> 00:31:58,597
I loathe you.

428
00:31:58,810 --> 00:32:00,183
I despise you.

429
00:32:02,267 --> 00:32:03,594
You made a lot
of progress last night.

430
00:32:03,809 --> 00:32:07,670
This is your old buddy Scat. Don't
you remember at the rail and the song?

431
00:32:07,890 --> 00:32:11,503
Officer, I want to report
these men. They're stowaways.

432
00:32:11,722 --> 00:32:13,179
You should've
played a record.

433
00:32:13,389 --> 00:32:16,588
Oh, so you're the two guys. Come with me!

434
00:32:16,804 --> 00:32:20,631
Wait a minute! The lapels!
Drop the material here.

435
00:32:23,135 --> 00:32:24,711
Fly, fly, fly!

436
00:32:28,550 --> 00:32:29,544
What happened?

437
00:32:29,758 --> 00:32:33,371
Nothing important, child.
Let's have breakfast.

438
00:32:45,211 --> 00:32:46,917
Shh! He's asleep.

439
00:32:47,127 --> 00:32:48,833
Sit down, gentlemen.
You're next.

440
00:32:49,043 --> 00:32:50,287
Thank you.

441
00:33:18,742 --> 00:33:19,736
Uh...?

442
00:33:21,823 --> 00:33:23,565
See anything of them?
No, sir.

443
00:33:23,782 --> 00:33:26,104
Check the linen lockers?
Yes, sir. No luck.

444
00:33:26,322 --> 00:33:29,354
I'll find those patty-cakers
if it's the last thing I do.

445
00:33:43,942 --> 00:33:44,936
Steady, Ingrid.

446
00:33:53,688 --> 00:33:55,430
Ha-ha! So sorry.

447
00:34:01,061 --> 00:34:02,056
Oops!

448
00:34:05,101 --> 00:34:07,340
Just a small gash.

449
00:34:11,225 --> 00:34:12,421
Shh! Shh!

450
00:34:30,051 --> 00:34:31,461
Shh!

451
00:34:35,257 --> 00:34:36,252
Shh!

452
00:34:40,048 --> 00:34:41,209
Shh!

453
00:35:01,291 --> 00:35:02,285
Shh!

454
00:35:42,527 --> 00:35:43,521
Thank you.

455
00:35:59,188 --> 00:36:00,182
Shh!

456
00:36:01,271 --> 00:36:02,680
What's that noise?

457
00:36:07,102 --> 00:36:08,381
My moustache!

458
00:36:08,602 --> 00:36:09,880
It's shorter now.
Why, you...!

459
00:36:10,101 --> 00:36:12,340
You look better.
You!

460
00:36:12,559 --> 00:36:14,181
I'll do the cutting now!

461
00:36:14,391 --> 00:36:17,341
Steady! Think it over!
I had a shave this morning!

462
00:36:17,557 --> 00:36:18,884
Okay, wise guys!

463
00:36:19,098 --> 00:36:21,551
Where have you been?
Well, how do you do?

464
00:36:21,764 --> 00:36:25,211
Somebody need a shave?
We gotta take care of the crew.

465
00:36:25,429 --> 00:36:28,592
It baffles me. What kind of
a piece of business is this?

466
00:36:28,803 --> 00:36:30,923
I save her life,
then she turns us in!

467
00:36:31,136 --> 00:36:32,593
Can you figure out
why she hates me?

468
00:36:32,802 --> 00:36:37,126
Why she hates you? No, that's
hard to figure why she hates you!

469
00:36:37,343 --> 00:36:38,420
Oh!

470
00:36:41,965 --> 00:36:43,707
The governor
get our note?

471
00:36:43,923 --> 00:36:45,628
Come on, the captain
wants to see you.

472
00:36:45,839 --> 00:36:49,204
If it isn't Captain Bligh.
Coming, Mr. Christian.

473
00:36:53,795 --> 00:36:56,329
Do you think he'll go for it?
I'll tell him we're both nuts.

474
00:36:56,544 --> 00:36:59,245
He'll only believe you.
The captain will do the talking!

475
00:36:59,460 --> 00:37:03,499
Say, captain, our presence...
We demand better treatment...

476
00:37:03,708 --> 00:37:05,615
Oh! Stay away from us,
will you, sister?

477
00:37:05,833 --> 00:37:08,320
Please, I wanna help you.
Oh, she wants to help us!

478
00:37:08,540 --> 00:37:10,696
You mad because
we're still breathing?

479
00:37:10,915 --> 00:37:12,573
I think these belong to you.

480
00:37:12,788 --> 00:37:14,696
Come to Daddy!
My old heater!

481
00:37:14,913 --> 00:37:16,488
My little brass gold mine!

482
00:37:16,704 --> 00:37:18,244
Now I can smoke up
and learn the truth.

483
00:37:18,454 --> 00:37:19,697
Did they hurt you?
Say, "Ah."

484
00:37:19,912 --> 00:37:22,445
Gentlemen, how would you like
to work your passage to Rio

485
00:37:22,660 --> 00:37:24,532
as members of
the ship's orchestra?

486
00:37:24,743 --> 00:37:25,737
Do you mean it?
Both of us?

487
00:37:25,951 --> 00:37:29,315
Yes, both of you. Just report to the
leader. I've already spoken to him.

488
00:37:29,533 --> 00:37:30,907
Wonderful!
Thanks a lot!

489
00:37:31,116 --> 00:37:35,322
Don't thank me. I leave you in
the custody of your benefactress.

490
00:37:36,489 --> 00:37:38,812
Can't we be friends?
I'm really very grateful.

491
00:37:39,030 --> 00:37:40,937
Grateful? What's the idea of turning us in?

492
00:37:41,154 --> 00:37:42,895
I don't know
what came over me.

493
00:37:43,112 --> 00:37:46,026
I found myself saying things and I
didn't know why I was saying them.

494
00:37:46,236 --> 00:37:49,600
Why don't you just run for
Congress and let us alone, huh?

495
00:37:49,818 --> 00:37:52,566
Now look! Lay off those
kisses. You know he's weak.

496
00:37:52,775 --> 00:37:55,098
I just wanted
to show my gratitude.

497
00:37:55,316 --> 00:37:57,057
Show me.
I can take it.

498
00:37:57,274 --> 00:38:00,224
All right. This is for both of you.

499
00:38:00,440 --> 00:38:01,600
Steady.

500
00:38:03,646 --> 00:38:05,601
I'll get him in
the next round... Oh!

501
00:38:05,812 --> 00:38:08,017
You should've been
with me in that refrigerator.

502
00:38:08,228 --> 00:38:11,558
Look, sister, you might as well face
it. My buddy's turned over a new leaf.

503
00:38:11,769 --> 00:38:13,593
Tell her.

504
00:38:13,810 --> 00:38:15,681
In a lifetime of
tears and laughter,

505
00:38:15,893 --> 00:38:19,092
it's been my discovery that friendship
between two men is more important

506
00:38:19,308 --> 00:38:22,388
than friendship between
a man and a woman.

507
00:38:22,599 --> 00:38:23,972
Duller but more important.

508
00:38:24,182 --> 00:38:25,425
Tell her you're
through with women.

509
00:38:25,639 --> 00:38:30,544
And as far as you and I are concerned,
we don't even know each other.

510
00:38:50,839 --> 00:38:53,042
Ladies and gentlemen,
as you know, we arrive in Rio shortly,

511
00:38:53,255 --> 00:38:57,117
and the purser's asked me to announce if
you have any questions about disembarkation

512
00:38:57,337 --> 00:39:01,116
he'd be glad to answer them for you if you
come to his office in the morning. Thank you.

513
00:39:06,334 --> 00:39:08,289
"Hey, Mr. Sweeney?"
Hello.

514
00:39:08,500 --> 00:39:11,911
"We've a problem That is apt to spoil
the trip Because when we get off the ship"

515
00:39:12,124 --> 00:39:15,570
"We know we'll never Understand
the language We won't be hip"

516
00:39:17,664 --> 00:39:19,488
"Oh, now, Miss Andrews"

517
00:39:19,705 --> 00:39:23,318
"After due deliberation Of your
problem All you do is move and wobble"

518
00:39:23,537 --> 00:39:26,450
"Which in any language
Always means a miss"

519
00:39:26,661 --> 00:39:28,236
"A kiss"

520
00:39:28,452 --> 00:39:29,649
"And this?"

521
00:39:31,534 --> 00:39:33,157
La Pontinia!

522
00:39:33,367 --> 00:39:37,573
Hey, amigo? Now we know.

523
00:39:37,782 --> 00:39:40,316
"Now they know"

524
00:39:40,531 --> 00:39:43,019
"Yes, we know"

525
00:39:43,238 --> 00:39:45,394
"Now they know"

526
00:39:45,612 --> 00:39:48,017
"Yes, we know"

527
00:39:48,237 --> 00:39:51,400
"Now they know"

528
00:39:55,860 --> 00:39:58,643
"Supposing you need a vacation"

529
00:39:58,859 --> 00:40:01,476
"Brazil is the place you should be"

530
00:40:01,691 --> 00:40:04,557
"So you can't understand
What they're saying"

531
00:40:04,773 --> 00:40:07,391
"Or you can't read
A sign that you see"

532
00:40:07,605 --> 00:40:10,852
"But you don't have
To know the language"

533
00:40:11,062 --> 00:40:17,057
"With the moon in the sky And a girl
in your arms And a look in her eye"

534
00:40:17,269 --> 00:40:20,219
"You stop at the Copacabana"

535
00:40:20,435 --> 00:40:23,004
"With Sugar Loaf Mountain in view"

536
00:40:23,225 --> 00:40:26,305
"Though the words
On the menu mean nothing"

537
00:40:26,516 --> 00:40:28,755
"You can't ask a soul
What to do"

538
00:40:28,973 --> 00:40:32,219
"But you don't have
To know the language"

539
00:40:32,431 --> 00:40:36,719
"With the moon in the sky And a girl
in your arms And a look in her eye"

540
00:40:36,929 --> 00:40:38,208
That the good one?
No, this one.

541
00:40:38,429 --> 00:40:41,509
"When she smiles your way"

542
00:40:41,719 --> 00:40:44,207
"What more would you want
Anyone to say?"

543
00:40:44,427 --> 00:40:48,004
"So you sigh, just sigh"

544
00:40:48,217 --> 00:40:53,749
"You don't have to mention
That Yankee phrase, aye, aye"

545
00:40:53,965 --> 00:40:56,915
"Perhaps when you end
Your vacation"

546
00:40:57,131 --> 00:40:59,665
"You'll bring back a bit of Brazil"

547
00:40:59,879 --> 00:41:03,126
"So you can't understand
What she's saying"

548
00:41:03,337 --> 00:41:05,576
"You need an interpreter still"

549
00:41:05,794 --> 00:41:09,040
"But you don't have
To know the language"

550
00:41:09,252 --> 00:41:13,907
"With the moon in the sky And a girl
in your arms And a look in her eye"

551
00:41:14,125 --> 00:41:18,248
"I know you don't have
To know the language"

552
00:41:18,456 --> 00:41:21,703
"If you don't want to say goodbye"

553
00:41:23,038 --> 00:41:25,822
"With the moon in the sky"

554
00:41:26,037 --> 00:41:29,070
"And a girl in your arms"

555
00:41:29,287 --> 00:41:30,695
"It's the look in her eye"

556
00:41:30,911 --> 00:41:33,481
"You don't have to know
You don't have to know"

557
00:41:33,702 --> 00:41:36,699
"The language isn't necessary
'Cause the meaning doesn't vary"

558
00:41:36,909 --> 00:41:42,737
"If you've got the charm and taste
The language isn't necessary"

559
00:42:00,317 --> 00:42:07,141
"When she smiles your way"

560
00:42:07,399 --> 00:42:13,227
"What more would you want
Anyone to say?"

561
00:42:13,438 --> 00:42:20,262
"So you sigh, just sigh"

562
00:42:21,477 --> 00:42:26,631
"You don't have to mention
That Yankee phrase, aye, aye"

563
00:42:26,851 --> 00:42:30,050
"Perhaps when you end
Your vacation"

564
00:42:30,267 --> 00:42:32,801
"You'll bring back a bit of Brazil"

565
00:42:33,015 --> 00:42:36,012
"So you can't understand
What she's saying"

566
00:42:36,223 --> 00:42:38,591
"You need an interpreter still"

567
00:42:38,805 --> 00:42:41,968
"But you don't even have
To know the language"

568
00:42:42,179 --> 00:42:46,171
"With the moon in the sky And the girl
in your arms And a look in her eye"

569
00:42:46,386 --> 00:42:47,582
"Aye, aye, aye, aye!"

570
00:42:47,802 --> 00:42:51,048
"So you don't have
To know the language"

571
00:42:51,259 --> 00:42:57,752
"If you don't want to say goodbye"

572
00:43:11,669 --> 00:43:13,659
Some orchestra!
I still got three bars to go.

573
00:43:13,876 --> 00:43:17,536
That's two under par for you.
Everybody's finished.

574
00:43:17,750 --> 00:43:18,912
Hey, wait a minute.

575
00:43:19,125 --> 00:43:20,949
Where are you going?
Going out for a little smoke.

576
00:43:21,166 --> 00:43:24,364
Oh, no. You've been telling me that every night
for the past week. This time I'm going with you.

577
00:43:24,581 --> 00:43:27,034
Make sure it's only
the pipe that smokes!

578
00:43:29,080 --> 00:43:30,952
Just a minute, clumsy.
Pick up that stuff.

579
00:43:31,162 --> 00:43:33,069
What?
You heard what the man said.

580
00:43:33,286 --> 00:43:34,696
Stoop if you can.
Come on.

581
00:43:36,452 --> 00:43:38,857
What stuff?
This stuff.

582
00:43:43,991 --> 00:43:45,816
Excuse me.
Certainly.

583
00:43:53,280 --> 00:43:54,985
Excuse me, please.

584
00:44:01,902 --> 00:44:02,897
Harry?

585
00:44:06,942 --> 00:44:09,311
She'll be meeting him
in the same place.

586
00:44:09,525 --> 00:44:11,431
See what they're up to.

587
00:44:33,933 --> 00:44:37,013
Strange business. I don't get it.
Where's that radiogram you mentioned?

588
00:44:37,224 --> 00:44:39,049
I've hidden it over here.
Let me see it.

589
00:44:39,264 --> 00:44:41,385
It arrive today for Mrs. Vail.

590
00:44:41,597 --> 00:44:43,089
I opened it.

591
00:44:46,388 --> 00:44:49,917
"Rodrigues knows about the papers.
Immediate marriage necessary."

592
00:44:50,136 --> 00:44:51,249
Signed "Sherman."

593
00:44:51,469 --> 00:44:53,423
What papers?
I can't imagine.

594
00:44:53,635 --> 00:44:54,749
Who's this Rodrigues?

595
00:44:54,968 --> 00:44:56,839
He's the attorney
for my aunt's estate.

596
00:44:57,051 --> 00:44:59,124
Looks to me like Sherman's
after your money.

597
00:44:59,342 --> 00:45:00,620
Oh, no.

598
00:45:00,841 --> 00:45:02,120
It couldn't be that.

599
00:45:02,341 --> 00:45:04,626
My aunt Catherine has
supported me all of my life.

600
00:45:04,839 --> 00:45:08,749
I still don't like her.
She gives me a creepy feeling.

601
00:45:08,964 --> 00:45:11,451
You know, lately I seem
to get the same feeling.

602
00:45:11,671 --> 00:45:15,036
Sometimes when she talks to
me, I get chills up my spine.

603
00:45:15,253 --> 00:45:19,707
Honey, next time you get chilly,
I'm your man.

604
00:45:21,125 --> 00:45:22,831
Lucia, mind if I come in?

605
00:45:23,042 --> 00:45:26,324
How do you like that dish-faced
Don Juan? He's checking up on me.

606
00:45:26,540 --> 00:45:28,116
Lucia? This is Hot Lips.

607
00:45:28,332 --> 00:45:32,028
String him along a little bit.
We might need him, huh?

608
00:45:37,162 --> 00:45:39,863
No, this is
the first place he looks.

609
00:45:45,867 --> 00:45:47,692
Well, here I am.
Start bubbling.

610
00:45:47,909 --> 00:45:48,903
Hello.

611
00:45:49,116 --> 00:45:50,111
Are you alone?

612
00:45:50,324 --> 00:45:51,782
I certainly am alone.
Why do you ask?

613
00:45:51,990 --> 00:45:53,696
I thought you might have
a date with bean belly.

614
00:45:53,907 --> 00:45:55,647
Oh, no.
What makes you think that?

615
00:45:55,864 --> 00:45:57,984
He's always looking
for a place to keep warm.

616
00:45:58,197 --> 00:46:00,233
You don't think I could
get serious about him,

617
00:46:00,446 --> 00:46:03,776
with a great big handsome hunk
of man like you around, do you?

618
00:46:03,986 --> 00:46:05,728
Just call me Hunk.

619
00:46:05,945 --> 00:46:07,815
All right, Hunk.

620
00:46:08,027 --> 00:46:09,933
I must remember
what kind of soap I use.

621
00:46:10,151 --> 00:46:13,101
Here, drop anchor and we'll
talk it over. Did I say "talk"?

622
00:46:13,317 --> 00:46:14,595
Yes, we do have a lot...

623
00:46:14,816 --> 00:46:17,600
I know there's not much time
for talking. I know how you feel.

624
00:46:17,815 --> 00:46:20,385
Shall I kiss you now or do you
want me to tease you for a while?

625
00:46:20,606 --> 00:46:23,389
Oh, but, Hot Lips...
I'm all lips.

626
00:46:23,605 --> 00:46:26,058
Please, I...
I know how you feel.

627
00:46:26,271 --> 00:46:28,427
You're warm and grateful,
passionate...

628
00:46:31,311 --> 00:46:32,554
What's the matter,
you crazy or something?

629
00:46:32,769 --> 00:46:34,142
Please, I...
Who came in?

630
00:46:34,352 --> 00:46:37,632
I'm sorry, I lost my head.
Yeah, that makes two of us.

631
00:46:38,892 --> 00:46:41,379
I'm sorry. Please sit down.

632
00:46:41,599 --> 00:46:42,761
You sold me, baby.

633
00:46:42,973 --> 00:46:44,549
Come on, dear.

634
00:46:44,765 --> 00:46:46,754
That's better.
Let's live a little.

635
00:46:48,597 --> 00:46:50,551
Forgiven?
Oh, naturally.

636
00:46:50,763 --> 00:46:52,006
Naturally.

637
00:46:52,221 --> 00:46:55,383
Oh, you have such
a nice smooth hand.

638
00:46:55,594 --> 00:46:56,791
Oh!

639
00:46:57,010 --> 00:46:59,250
This one's even softer.

640
00:46:59,468 --> 00:47:01,340
And this one's softer, too!

641
00:47:01,550 --> 00:47:03,671
You have three
of the nicest...

642
00:47:03,883 --> 00:47:06,453
Three hands? Three...? And
this one's got hair on it!

643
00:47:06,674 --> 00:47:08,878
Aha! And it's got an ape
on the end of it!

644
00:47:09,090 --> 00:47:10,582
Alone, huh?
Who's this, your father?

645
00:47:10,798 --> 00:47:13,464
You were never better. Great try.
Goodbye, sister! And don't write!

646
00:47:13,671 --> 00:47:17,001
Take it easy. Let me tell you...
That's all right. I'm not blaming you.

647
00:47:17,213 --> 00:47:19,497
You couldn't help yourself. You're
just a weak spineless jellyfish.

648
00:47:19,711 --> 00:47:22,542
You're so sweet.
I know what's cooking here.

649
00:47:22,752 --> 00:47:24,872
This doll's making a play
for you so she can get to me!

650
00:47:25,085 --> 00:47:26,625
But, Hot Lips...
It's not gonna work.

651
00:47:26,834 --> 00:47:30,364
You double-crossed your last
sucker. Let's blow this nest.

652
00:47:30,583 --> 00:47:32,371
Uh-oh! Mrs. Vail.
Who?

653
00:47:32,582 --> 00:47:34,407
The Black Widow.
The closet, come on!

654
00:47:36,997 --> 00:47:38,075
Shh!

655
00:47:42,537 --> 00:47:45,984
Oh, there you are. The captain's
been asking for you, child.

656
00:47:46,203 --> 00:47:48,276
I was just coming up.

657
00:48:07,862 --> 00:48:10,231
Don't kick them.
They've had enough.

658
00:48:10,444 --> 00:48:12,813
Cigarette?
Thank you.

659
00:48:34,936 --> 00:48:36,760
There's my brother.

660
00:48:38,144 --> 00:48:39,138
Sherman?

661
00:48:40,143 --> 00:48:42,263
Hello, darling!
I'll meet you at the gangplank!

662
00:48:44,475 --> 00:48:45,469
Where's Lucia?

663
00:48:49,598 --> 00:48:52,168
Find Lucia.
Yes, ma'am.

664
00:48:52,388 --> 00:48:55,469
Scat, you do believe that I didn't know
those men were in the closet?

665
00:48:55,679 --> 00:48:59,802
I believe you, but that Hot Lips still thinks
he was framed. Let him think that way, huh?

666
00:49:00,011 --> 00:49:02,131
What are we doing? I thought
you were getting me off the boat.

667
00:49:02,344 --> 00:49:05,424
Stand by. Genius.
Thinking all the time.

668
00:49:05,635 --> 00:49:07,920
There you are, all to
yourself. Very intimate.

669
00:49:08,133 --> 00:49:10,419
Scat, you're a genius.
Well, I admit it.

670
00:49:10,633 --> 00:49:12,788
Get in there.
Take off that skimmer.

671
00:49:13,007 --> 00:49:15,459
Can you handle it?
Oh, I think so.

672
00:49:15,672 --> 00:49:18,339
In case you want to get a little
air, you can bore yourself an opening.

673
00:49:18,547 --> 00:49:20,169
No dancing, please.

674
00:49:24,128 --> 00:49:25,123
Tilt!

675
00:49:29,543 --> 00:49:30,538
Sorry, honey.

676
00:49:30,751 --> 00:49:32,291
Hey, what do you say...?
Oh, there you are!

677
00:49:32,500 --> 00:49:33,779
Why did you want
to meet down here?

678
00:49:34,000 --> 00:49:36,748
Big news. We signed a bull fiddle
player. We're gonna meet him at the hotel.

679
00:49:36,957 --> 00:49:39,113
That's... What do we want
with a bull fiddle player?

680
00:49:39,332 --> 00:49:41,784
My mind is working all the
time, wheels are turning.

681
00:49:41,997 --> 00:49:43,241
Tell me more, Orson.

682
00:49:43,455 --> 00:49:46,073
When we get off the boat, we'll get a
band for you, like you always wanted.

683
00:49:46,288 --> 00:49:47,780
Isn't that wonderful?
Are you happy?

684
00:49:47,995 --> 00:49:51,774
Let me see how you look when
you're happy. Not that happy!

685
00:49:51,994 --> 00:49:54,611
I talk the language, I'll make
the contacts. We can't miss.

686
00:49:54,826 --> 00:49:58,108
You're getting on the ball! For a minute,
I thought you were down here with Lucia.

687
00:49:58,325 --> 00:50:00,031
No! That doll is
cooked for me, boy.

688
00:50:01,449 --> 00:50:03,274
Feels like the bull
is already in here.

689
00:50:04,865 --> 00:50:07,187
Hey! Why do we have
to carry this thing?

690
00:50:07,405 --> 00:50:10,604
It's a union rule down here. The bull fiddle
player never carries his own instrument.

691
00:50:10,821 --> 00:50:13,060
They got their own union?
Yes. Take some.

692
00:50:13,279 --> 00:50:14,273
Here we go.

693
00:50:15,903 --> 00:50:18,391
Push a little. This is no ricksha!
Left rudder!

694
00:50:20,151 --> 00:50:23,018
I can't understand you leaving
Lucia without even saying goodbye.

695
00:50:23,233 --> 00:50:25,638
I'm through with that chick. I told
you downstairs, don't you believe me?

696
00:50:25,858 --> 00:50:27,054
Yeah.

697
00:50:27,274 --> 00:50:29,394
Can you breathe all right?
Sure I can breathe.

698
00:50:29,607 --> 00:50:30,803
See?

699
00:50:31,023 --> 00:50:32,811
It won't be long.

700
00:50:38,228 --> 00:50:40,633
Easy there, butterfingers, easy!

701
00:50:42,977 --> 00:50:44,801
You waiting
for your broom?

702
00:50:47,100 --> 00:50:49,422
I'll listen for you
on "Inner Sanctum."

703
00:50:51,557 --> 00:50:54,010
What about Rodrigues?
Nothing yet.

704
00:50:54,223 --> 00:50:57,919
As long as he doesn't get to Lucia
before the wedding, we're safe.

705
00:51:00,721 --> 00:51:02,546
The papers.
Good.

706
00:51:03,887 --> 00:51:05,757
Put them away.

707
00:51:09,385 --> 00:51:11,209
Where's the girl?
She's not on the boat.

708
00:51:11,426 --> 00:51:13,462
What do you mean?
She's not on the boat.

709
00:51:13,675 --> 00:51:15,381
She must've gotten off
with those two musicians.

710
00:51:15,591 --> 00:51:17,829
What two musicians?
Two men she met on the boat.

711
00:51:18,048 --> 00:51:19,127
What about
the wedding?

712
00:51:19,339 --> 00:51:22,253
There'll be a wedding.
They just left the pier.

713
00:51:22,464 --> 00:51:24,786
Follow them
and you'll find Lucia.

714
00:51:25,005 --> 00:51:26,994
And then take care
of those two.

715
00:51:36,584 --> 00:51:38,705
I hope you had a pleasant
trip, Captain Harmon.

716
00:51:38,916 --> 00:51:40,160
Ah, Mr. Rodrigues.

717
00:51:40,374 --> 00:51:44,153
Tell me, captain, have you
seen Senhorita Lucia de Andrade?

718
00:51:44,373 --> 00:51:46,659
Lucia? Didn't she get off with her aunt?

719
00:51:46,873 --> 00:51:48,151
No, I didn't see her.

720
00:51:48,372 --> 00:51:50,694
Then she must've left with
those two American musicians.

721
00:51:50,912 --> 00:51:52,369
Two American musicians?

722
00:51:52,579 --> 00:51:54,237
I wonder how
I can find them.

723
00:51:54,454 --> 00:51:56,443
That shouldn't be very
difficult. One of them has...

724
00:52:02,534 --> 00:52:05,199
Thank you very much,
captain. Thank you!

725
00:52:07,240 --> 00:52:09,609
What is this, another lobby?
Don't be silly. This is our suite.

726
00:52:09,823 --> 00:52:10,984
Our suite?
Who pays?

727
00:52:13,405 --> 00:52:15,478
Drop it, yes.

728
00:52:15,696 --> 00:52:18,018
Hey, hey! Who's getting
married? This is two men!

729
00:52:18,237 --> 00:52:19,646
Compliment of the hotel, senhor.

730
00:52:19,862 --> 00:52:22,265
Oh, on the cuff!
Keep it coming!

731
00:52:22,485 --> 00:52:24,605
Tip the boys, huh?
We're down to our last buck.

732
00:52:24,818 --> 00:52:27,223
How do you say "give me
some change" in Portuguese?

733
00:52:27,442 --> 00:52:29,397
It's too late. There they go. They're off.

734
00:52:29,608 --> 00:52:32,440
Check back, men, huh?
Check back!

735
00:52:32,649 --> 00:52:35,811
We're down to the burlap.
Give me a hand with this thing.

736
00:52:36,023 --> 00:52:39,304
Hurry up. Just take it right there
by the end. That's a good man! Up!

737
00:52:39,521 --> 00:52:41,974
Don't strain yourself there!
There's another handle, you know!

738
00:52:42,187 --> 00:52:43,596
What are you,
the head of the union?

739
00:52:43,812 --> 00:52:46,762
You're always beefing. You'd holler
if you were hung with a new rope.

740
00:52:46,977 --> 00:52:50,176
Here we are, living in a wonderful
suite. The most expensive in the hotel.

741
00:52:50,393 --> 00:52:51,933
And there'd better be
a fire escape.

742
00:52:52,143 --> 00:52:53,136
You all right?

743
00:52:53,350 --> 00:52:55,470
You keep asking me.
I'm all right!

744
00:52:55,683 --> 00:52:59,177
Okay. Then put this
over in the corner, will you?

745
00:52:59,390 --> 00:53:01,344
Why don't you get a whip?

746
00:53:01,556 --> 00:53:02,716
You're not
a little stiff, are you?

747
00:53:02,930 --> 00:53:06,460
Stiff? I haven't had a drink
since I left the boat.

748
00:53:06,679 --> 00:53:09,381
Nice setup, a suite! What
do we need two bedrooms for?

749
00:53:09,594 --> 00:53:12,261
You can't expect Lucia
to sleep on the sofa.

750
00:53:12,468 --> 00:53:16,331
No, sir. If anybody sleeps
on the sofa, I'm... Huh?

751
00:53:16,551 --> 00:53:19,667
Aha! Aha!
Hello, Hot Lips.

752
00:53:19,882 --> 00:53:22,453
Oh, no, no! You're a mirage. It can't be.

753
00:53:22,674 --> 00:53:25,043
It's just a figment
of my imagination.

754
00:53:25,256 --> 00:53:27,495
A soft figment.
A bull fiddle, huh?

755
00:53:27,714 --> 00:53:30,118
Wait a minute. The bull
fiddle, those two gorillas...

756
00:53:30,338 --> 00:53:32,375
If they'd have known what was
going on, they'd have killed us.

757
00:53:32,588 --> 00:53:34,411
What makes me think they
didn't know? Come on!

758
00:53:34,628 --> 00:53:35,789
Take it easy!
Take it easy!

759
00:53:36,003 --> 00:53:38,241
So long, sister. If we don't get
in touch, it's nothing personal.

760
00:53:38,460 --> 00:53:40,497
It's just that we're
prejudiced against dying young.

761
00:53:40,710 --> 00:53:41,953
He's right, Scat.
This is my problem.

762
00:53:42,167 --> 00:53:43,161
Hold it, now, wait!

763
00:53:43,375 --> 00:53:45,661
This gal's in a lot of trouble,
and you gotta help her.

764
00:53:45,874 --> 00:53:47,663
Like any guy would,
with red blood in his veins!

765
00:53:47,873 --> 00:53:49,496
I got news for you,
I'm anaemic.

766
00:53:49,707 --> 00:53:51,992
She stays with us.
Nothing doing.

767
00:53:52,205 --> 00:53:56,945
If you think I'll let a beautiful doll like this
live in the same apartment that I'm living in...

768
00:53:57,162 --> 00:53:58,951
If you think...

769
00:53:59,161 --> 00:54:00,240
If you...

770
00:54:01,327 --> 00:54:02,322
lf...

771
00:54:02,536 --> 00:54:04,028
Yes, Hot Lips.

772
00:54:05,076 --> 00:54:07,398
I'll give you just 72 hours
to get out of here.

773
00:54:07,617 --> 00:54:10,816
Grand! Now we're promoting. Come one, what
are we waiting for? Let's live a little!

774
00:54:11,032 --> 00:54:12,608
I'd like to, if you'd only let me!

775
00:54:12,824 --> 00:54:14,612
Open this up.
I'll have mine straight.

776
00:54:14,823 --> 00:54:17,689
Happy grapes!
Are you ready to bubble?

777
00:54:17,905 --> 00:54:21,104
The Guanabara Club, please. Yes...

778
00:54:21,320 --> 00:54:23,773
I'd like to speak
to Senhor Cardoso.

779
00:54:23,987 --> 00:54:24,981
Who's Cardoso?

780
00:54:25,194 --> 00:54:28,725
One of the band gave me a lead on him.
He goes for jump music in a big way.

781
00:54:28,943 --> 00:54:30,980
We're gonna pick up a little
bread. Now we're moving.

782
00:54:31,192 --> 00:54:32,354
Hello, Cardoso?

783
00:54:32,567 --> 00:54:34,641
This is Scat Sweeney of Scat
Sweeney & His Dixie Hotshots.

784
00:54:34,858 --> 00:54:37,227
Featuring Hot Lips Barton.
Featuring Hot Lips Barton, yeah.

785
00:54:37,440 --> 00:54:40,804
Zoot Shapiro told me to look
you up when we landed down here.

786
00:54:41,022 --> 00:54:43,142
He said you might have a spot
for our band in your club.

787
00:54:43,355 --> 00:54:45,925
If you're any good,
I certainly could use you.

788
00:54:46,146 --> 00:54:49,760
Mr. Cardoso!
Our group is gone! Really gone!

789
00:54:49,978 --> 00:54:52,347
I've also got a great gal singer
with us, Ginger O'Roark.

790
00:54:52,561 --> 00:54:54,053
Great singer?

791
00:54:54,269 --> 00:54:57,100
Hell, if she looks like Lamour,
she can sing like Lamour, can't she?

792
00:54:57,308 --> 00:55:00,223
Oh! Tell him she plays
bull fiddle from the inside.

793
00:55:00,432 --> 00:55:03,265
Also plays the... No!

794
00:55:03,473 --> 00:55:06,885
The rest of the band?
Well, there's, uh...

795
00:55:07,097 --> 00:55:11,090
Well, there's me and Hot Lips Barton.
That's two.

796
00:55:11,304 --> 00:55:13,970
Three, four, five pieces.

797
00:55:14,178 --> 00:55:15,968
Five pieces
in the band, yes.

798
00:55:16,177 --> 00:55:18,879
Say...
Shh! Yes, Mr. Cardoso?

799
00:55:19,093 --> 00:55:22,292
That's a little soon, don't you
think? How about tomorrow night?

800
00:55:22,509 --> 00:55:25,422
Fine, fine. You got
yourself a band, brother!

801
00:55:25,633 --> 00:55:26,911
How's that for
operating, huh?

802
00:55:27,133 --> 00:55:30,959
Don't put away your scalpel, doc.
Where are the other pieces? Let's...

803
00:55:40,545 --> 00:55:42,333
You mean, you're
gonna hire those guys?

804
00:55:42,544 --> 00:55:43,952
Why not?
Let's talk to them.

805
00:55:44,168 --> 00:55:46,074
I'll be back in a minute.
But they're on key.

806
00:55:46,292 --> 00:55:49,124
Come on, break open
the happy brew.

807
00:55:49,333 --> 00:55:51,821
Let's go.
Thank you.

808
00:55:53,416 --> 00:55:54,445
Oh!

809
00:56:02,246 --> 00:56:03,619
To the Dixie Hotshots?
Yes, right!

810
00:56:06,577 --> 00:56:09,740
Not so hard!
I must go on a diet.

811
00:56:09,951 --> 00:56:13,565
That grape must be a little
grumpy. Shall we go again?

812
00:56:13,783 --> 00:56:15,489
Put it right in there.

813
00:56:19,490 --> 00:56:20,947
That's pretty
athletic stuff.

814
00:56:21,156 --> 00:56:22,945
That might've happened
to my stomach.

815
00:56:23,155 --> 00:56:26,188
Ready, boys?
I guess so. We're though here.

816
00:56:26,405 --> 00:56:27,601
How about that?

817
00:56:30,112 --> 00:56:31,485
Don't miss this time.

818
00:56:33,069 --> 00:56:34,478
What are you looking for?
A light.

819
00:56:36,942 --> 00:56:38,932
Well, you've got a light.

820
00:56:39,150 --> 00:56:42,230
They don't call me
Hot Lips for nothing, you know.

821
00:56:43,856 --> 00:56:46,806
Hey, let's get out of here.
This joint is haunted.

822
00:57:37,172 --> 00:57:38,664
Just what we need, huh?

823
00:57:38,880 --> 00:57:41,747
We'll never get away with it. We
want Dixie Hotshots not Hot Tamales.

824
00:57:41,963 --> 00:57:44,414
It's simple. We'll get five
snappy, zooty uniforms.

825
00:57:44,628 --> 00:57:46,748
Using what for money?
Hock something we don't need.

826
00:57:46,961 --> 00:57:48,702
Like your head?
Wait a minute.

827
00:57:48,918 --> 00:57:51,204
I think I can help. I know a
store where we can get credit.

828
00:57:51,417 --> 00:57:54,165
Great. I'll clinch the deal. Hey, fellas!

829
00:57:59,165 --> 00:58:00,159
Tell them.

830
00:58:11,328 --> 00:58:13,401
What did you say?
They're joining up!

831
00:58:13,618 --> 00:58:15,407
Wait, Shorts!
Let's not be that grateful.

832
00:58:15,618 --> 00:58:17,608
That's our racket.
Lead us to the store.

833
00:58:17,825 --> 00:58:19,234
Here we go, come along.

834
00:58:19,450 --> 00:58:21,026
Wait.
What's your problem?

835
00:58:21,241 --> 00:58:22,863
Lobster Ear, don't you
wanna think this over?

836
00:58:23,074 --> 00:58:25,110
No, nothing to think over.
Come along, we're set.

837
00:58:25,323 --> 00:58:26,484
You're happy, huh?

838
00:58:29,488 --> 00:58:31,643
Gee, things grow fast
in this country!

839
00:58:31,862 --> 00:58:33,899
Tropics, you know.
Come along.

840
00:58:41,276 --> 00:58:44,024
Scat Sweeney was one
of those men on the boat.

841
00:58:44,234 --> 00:58:46,519
And Ginger O'Roark is Lucia.

842
00:58:55,896 --> 00:58:58,348
Good evening.
Mrs. Vail's reservation.

843
00:58:58,561 --> 00:59:00,766
Yes. Right this way, please.

844
00:59:03,101 --> 00:59:04,973
I don't like it. These stripes
look too good on us.

845
00:59:05,185 --> 00:59:06,298
You would know.

846
00:59:06,518 --> 00:59:09,633
I get a funny feeling about this
whole deal. It's too perfect.

847
00:59:09,849 --> 00:59:13,676
Stop worrying. You wanna get
wrinkles over you wrinkles?

848
00:59:21,054 --> 00:59:23,423
They look more like Americans than we
do. They could be the Andrews Brothers.

849
00:59:23,637 --> 00:59:25,259
Yeah, Patty, La Verne
and Pancho!

850
00:59:25,470 --> 00:59:27,376
Wait. Hold everything.
What's your problem?

851
00:59:27,594 --> 00:59:30,211
We're supposed to be Americans.
They don't understand English!

852
00:59:30,426 --> 00:59:33,790
I got that licked! We teach them a little hep
talk, and Cardoso will never know the difference.

853
00:59:43,130 --> 00:59:44,539
Now, break it up
for us foreigners.

854
00:59:44,755 --> 00:59:47,159
Wilco.

855
00:59:47,378 --> 00:59:50,743
"You're telling me."
"You're telling me."

856
00:59:50,961 --> 00:59:52,916
You telling me.

857
00:59:53,127 --> 00:59:54,832
You're telling me.

858
00:59:58,875 --> 01:00:00,581
"You're in the groove, Jackson."

859
01:00:00,791 --> 01:00:04,286
You're in the groove, Jackson.

860
01:00:04,498 --> 01:00:06,120
You're in the groove,
Jackson.

861
01:00:06,331 --> 01:00:07,326
You're telling me.

862
01:00:07,538 --> 01:00:08,782
You're in the groove,
Jackson.

863
01:00:08,996 --> 01:00:10,240
You're telling me.
What do you think?

864
01:00:10,455 --> 01:00:13,534
"What do you...?" What do
I think? This is murder!

865
01:00:13,745 --> 01:00:15,652
This is murder.
This is murder.

866
01:00:15,869 --> 01:00:18,571
You're in the groove...
You're telling me.

867
01:00:18,785 --> 01:00:20,491
What do I think?
What do I...?

868
01:00:20,701 --> 01:00:23,946
Time! Time! Drag!
You better rehearse.

869
01:00:24,158 --> 01:00:25,402
Right.

870
01:00:25,616 --> 01:00:27,606
When I hold up one finger...

871
01:00:30,406 --> 01:00:31,436
You're telling me.

872
01:00:31,655 --> 01:00:33,563
You're in the groove, Jackson.
This is murder.

873
01:00:33,780 --> 01:00:35,486
Five more minutes, they'd
speak better English than you.

874
01:00:35,696 --> 01:00:37,769
You're in the groove, Jackson.
This is murder.

875
01:00:37,987 --> 01:00:39,776
They're off again!

876
01:00:39,986 --> 01:00:41,229
Come on! Come on!

877
01:00:41,444 --> 01:00:43,434
Yes, sir, yes, sir!
We're all ready.

878
01:00:51,149 --> 01:00:53,602
Come on, honey,
We'll be on in a minute.

879
01:00:53,815 --> 01:00:54,845
I'm not quite dressed.

880
01:00:55,065 --> 01:00:57,434
Maybe I better help.
Tut-tut!

881
01:00:57,647 --> 01:00:59,851
I'm a little young, huh?

882
01:01:00,063 --> 01:01:01,555
Uh-oh! Trouble.

883
01:01:01,771 --> 01:01:04,175
I wish you
the best of luck.

884
01:01:08,061 --> 01:01:09,967
Come on, let's cut in, quick!

885
01:01:11,184 --> 01:01:12,973
Hi, Mr. Cardoso.
I see you've met the boys.

886
01:01:13,184 --> 01:01:14,557
Not really.
I was just...

887
01:01:14,767 --> 01:01:18,012
This is Spike, Satch and Oscar.
Spike, Satch and Oscar.

888
01:01:18,223 --> 01:01:19,218
I'm honoured,
gentlemen.

889
01:01:19,431 --> 01:01:20,923
Okay, fellas,
on the stand.

890
01:01:21,139 --> 01:01:23,046
You have a few
minutes, yet.

891
01:01:23,263 --> 01:01:24,377
Let's shoot the grease, hey, boys?

892
01:01:24,597 --> 01:01:25,875
They use most of it
in their hair.

893
01:01:26,096 --> 01:01:27,423
They don't talk
very much, do they?

894
01:01:27,637 --> 01:01:29,922
Well, actually, they talk a
blue streak when they get going.

895
01:01:30,136 --> 01:01:32,091
Yeah. Say something
to Mr. Cardoso, fellas.

896
01:01:34,093 --> 01:01:35,336
You're in the groove,
Jackson.

897
01:01:35,551 --> 01:01:36,794
Isn't he sweet?

898
01:01:37,009 --> 01:01:39,461
Plant me now and pick
me later, eh, big boy?

899
01:01:39,674 --> 01:01:41,464
You're groovy!
Shall we, then? Come along.

900
01:01:41,674 --> 01:01:43,214
Oh, just a minute.

901
01:01:44,548 --> 01:01:47,959
I'm sorry. You'll have to put
out that cigarette. No smoking.

902
01:01:50,504 --> 01:01:52,329
I said, no smoking.

903
01:01:55,295 --> 01:01:56,372
You're telling me.

904
01:01:56,586 --> 01:01:59,369
I'm telling him! He's
the one that's smoking.

905
01:02:00,918 --> 01:02:02,161
This is murder.

906
01:02:02,375 --> 01:02:06,699
I don't care if it is murder. You
cannot smoke. No smoking. No smoking.

907
01:02:06,916 --> 01:02:08,372
You're in the groove, Jackson.

908
01:02:08,582 --> 01:02:11,283
You don't have to get fresh,
I'm only telling him the rules!

909
01:02:11,497 --> 01:02:12,906
You're telling me.
Oh, no.

910
01:02:13,122 --> 01:02:15,691
I told you before,
I'm telling him!

911
01:02:15,913 --> 01:02:18,151
For the third time,
no smoking!

912
01:02:18,370 --> 01:02:19,400
This is murder.

913
01:02:21,578 --> 01:02:22,951
You wanna stunt your growth?

914
01:02:23,160 --> 01:02:25,316
He's a tobacco fiend, but it
shan't happen again. Shall we, then?

915
01:02:25,534 --> 01:02:27,157
"You're telling me"!

916
01:02:27,367 --> 01:02:30,068
You're telling me!
Back off!

917
01:02:30,283 --> 01:02:32,403
He likes to mimic people.

918
01:02:32,616 --> 01:02:34,156
His mother was
frightened by a parrot.

919
01:02:34,364 --> 01:02:36,022
Crazy Americans!

920
01:02:41,987 --> 01:02:43,894
Teach them some more
and we'll get killed.

921
01:02:44,111 --> 01:02:45,853
This is murder.
You're telling me.

922
01:02:48,943 --> 01:02:49,938
What a gown.

923
01:02:50,151 --> 01:02:52,983
How did you put that on?
With a spray gun?

924
01:02:53,192 --> 01:02:54,471
You heard what the man said, no smoking.

925
01:02:54,691 --> 01:02:55,686
Not one little puff?
No!

926
01:02:55,900 --> 01:02:56,893
Is everything
going all right?

927
01:02:57,107 --> 01:02:58,386
Sensational.
Watch this.

928
01:02:58,607 --> 01:03:01,059
You're telling me.
You're in the groove.

929
01:03:01,273 --> 01:03:03,061
You're telling me.
This is murder.

930
01:03:06,438 --> 01:03:08,474
Look out. We're on, come on!

931
01:03:12,643 --> 01:03:14,266
Let's try and finish
together, huh?

932
01:03:38,510 --> 01:03:41,377
"Romance"

933
01:03:41,593 --> 01:03:44,957
"It's such a wonderful thing"

934
01:03:45,175 --> 01:03:47,460
"One glance"

935
01:03:47,674 --> 01:03:51,120
"And I was set for a fling"

936
01:03:51,339 --> 01:03:58,293
"And he isn't flip and flighty
Like high school boys"

937
01:03:58,503 --> 01:04:06,038
"He's a college man
With plenty of poise"

938
01:04:07,459 --> 01:04:10,160
"He knows an awful lot"

939
01:04:10,374 --> 01:04:15,492
"I guess you'd say
He's got experience"

940
01:04:15,706 --> 01:04:17,696
"Experience"

941
01:04:17,913 --> 01:04:23,825
"He takes me out to dine
And knows the proper wine"

942
01:04:24,036 --> 01:04:28,324
"Because he's got experience"

943
01:04:28,535 --> 01:04:33,605
"Riding in his car
We had a flat"

944
01:04:33,825 --> 01:04:38,564
"It was dark as it could be"

945
01:04:38,781 --> 01:04:43,686
"He got the tools
And fixed it just like that"

946
01:04:43,905 --> 01:04:48,063
"Experience, you see"

947
01:04:48,279 --> 01:04:53,775
"He takes me straight home
And he bows and shakes my hand"

948
01:04:53,985 --> 01:04:59,269
"Experience comes through"

949
01:04:59,483 --> 01:05:03,855
"So if you want someone
To plan with"

950
01:05:04,065 --> 01:05:11,018
"I'll gladly give this man
With experience to you"

951
01:05:15,811 --> 01:05:17,848
Break it up big now, buddy.

952
01:06:12,334 --> 01:06:14,123
Let's get out of here.

953
01:06:14,333 --> 01:06:16,786
We can always open
a laundry somewhere.

954
01:06:16,999 --> 01:06:21,205
"Experience, you see"

955
01:06:21,414 --> 01:06:26,781
"He plays the nicest notes
And this belongs in quotes"

956
01:06:26,996 --> 01:06:32,030
"Experience comes through"

957
01:06:32,244 --> 01:06:36,319
"So if you want someone
To plan with"

958
01:06:36,534 --> 01:06:42,398
"I'll gladly give this man
With experience"

959
01:06:44,282 --> 01:06:48,523
"To you"

960
01:07:26,351 --> 01:07:30,130
Holy smoke! Did you hear
that applause? I think we're a hit.

961
01:07:30,349 --> 01:07:31,723
Honey, you were
perfect, wonderful!

962
01:07:31,932 --> 01:07:33,555
You think he'll hire us?
We're a cinch!

963
01:07:33,765 --> 01:07:35,969
My aunt is out front
and wants me to join her.

964
01:07:36,181 --> 01:07:38,385
No, not that woman again?
She's nothing but trouble.

965
01:07:38,596 --> 01:07:40,634
Not anymore, Scat.
I'll see her.

966
01:07:40,846 --> 01:07:43,334
Very good, boys! Very good!
Groovy, groovy!

967
01:07:43,554 --> 01:07:48,091
Ah, my dear!
You were wonderful!

968
01:07:48,301 --> 01:07:52,128
Congratulations, hepcats. From now
on, you are working for Cardoso.

969
01:07:52,342 --> 01:07:54,960
Best move you ever made. Come on, fellas!

970
01:07:55,174 --> 01:07:57,330
Get a dancer for the
bubbles. We'll be right back.

971
01:08:00,506 --> 01:08:02,331
Lucia, you were wonderful.

972
01:08:02,547 --> 01:08:05,117
Darling, congratulations.
Thank you, Sherman.

973
01:08:05,338 --> 01:08:08,288
Come on, sit down.
We'd like to talk to you.

974
01:08:08,503 --> 01:08:10,292
I'm sorry to have
to say this, Sherman,

975
01:08:10,503 --> 01:08:12,742
but if it's about the
wedding, my mind is made up.

976
01:08:12,961 --> 01:08:14,535
But, Lucia...
Of course, dear.

977
01:08:14,751 --> 01:08:19,537
We'd be the last to try to
change your mind. Do sit down.

978
01:08:21,916 --> 01:08:25,161
Naturally, I'm not very happy
about what you're doing, Lucia.

979
01:08:25,373 --> 01:08:29,235
But if that's the way you feel,
then, of course, I want to help you.

980
01:08:30,287 --> 01:08:34,860
Don't you see, dear? That's all.
I want to help you.

981
01:08:37,411 --> 01:08:39,649
A drink to our future,
gentlemen.

982
01:08:39,868 --> 01:08:41,739
Whoa! Steady.

983
01:08:41,951 --> 01:08:43,229
To the Dixie Hotshots!

984
01:08:43,450 --> 01:08:45,819
Who are they?
Oh, us! Yes.

985
01:08:47,157 --> 01:08:49,526
Well, Lu... Uh, Ginger.

986
01:08:49,739 --> 01:08:51,445
You're just in time,
Miss O'Roark.

987
01:08:51,656 --> 01:08:54,936
Get a load of this contract. We just
signed for five years. Two-week guarantee.

988
01:08:55,154 --> 01:08:57,026
Proud of me,
honey?

989
01:08:58,362 --> 01:08:59,605
I hate you.

990
01:08:59,820 --> 01:09:01,940
I loathe you.
I despise you.

991
01:09:03,360 --> 01:09:04,438
Baby!

992
01:09:04,652 --> 01:09:06,688
She acts
more like Bogie!

993
01:09:08,817 --> 01:09:11,305
Please, what is going on?
What is this?

994
01:09:11,524 --> 01:09:14,142
These men are making
a fool of you, Mr. Cardoso.

995
01:09:14,357 --> 01:09:16,808
They told you this was
an American band, but it isn't.

996
01:09:17,022 --> 01:09:19,723
They picked up those three men
right here on the street in Rio.

997
01:09:19,938 --> 01:09:22,640
Don't pay attention to her. She
jumps the track now and then.

998
01:09:22,853 --> 01:09:25,638
Her noggin's on the toboggan!
Cleo, your camels are waiting!

999
01:09:27,103 --> 01:09:30,217
Look at those clothes.
You are not Americans!

1000
01:09:30,434 --> 01:09:33,217
You're telling me!
You're telling me!

1001
01:09:33,433 --> 01:09:34,973
You're in the groove...

1002
01:09:35,183 --> 01:09:39,092
So, you are phoneys! You have
been making a fool of Cardoso.

1003
01:09:39,306 --> 01:09:42,588
No, we're doing everything for you.
You heard the applause.

1004
01:09:42,806 --> 01:09:47,296
That does not matter! Liars do
not work for Cardoso. Get out!

1005
01:09:49,095 --> 01:09:51,215
You don't have to call us
names. We're on the level.

1006
01:09:51,427 --> 01:09:53,832
Look at our faces.
Don't confuse the man!

1007
01:09:54,052 --> 01:09:55,046
Let me tell you...
Get out!

1008
01:09:55,259 --> 01:09:59,417
Pedro! Silvio! You are through. Fired!
Get out of here and never come back.

1009
01:09:59,633 --> 01:10:01,339
We can explain
everything.

1010
01:10:01,549 --> 01:10:02,543
If you'd just let us talk...

1011
01:10:02,757 --> 01:10:04,214
Whoa! Drop that body!

1012
01:10:10,712 --> 01:10:11,707
You all right, pal?

1013
01:10:11,921 --> 01:10:15,201
Oh, I hate you. I loathe
you. I despise you.

1014
01:10:15,419 --> 01:10:18,665
Lay off me, will you?
I feel bad enough.

1015
01:10:18,876 --> 01:10:21,708
You phoneys! You will
never work in Rio again!

1016
01:10:21,917 --> 01:10:24,073
Who wants to work?
We're musicians!

1017
01:10:26,124 --> 01:10:28,328
Broken-down trap.

1018
01:10:38,828 --> 01:10:39,823
Psst!

1019
01:11:03,529 --> 01:11:04,902
Huh?

1020
01:11:05,111 --> 01:11:06,308
Oh.

1021
01:12:01,884 --> 01:12:03,424
Good night, boys.

1022
01:12:03,634 --> 01:12:05,126
Good night, miss!

1023
01:12:16,921 --> 01:12:20,332
The papers. Put them in the safe
when you get to the plantation.

1024
01:12:20,544 --> 01:12:23,245
What about those two musicians?
They can still cause trouble.

1025
01:12:23,460 --> 01:12:24,538
Really, Sherman.

1026
01:12:24,751 --> 01:12:28,613
You should know by now
that I never leave any loose ends.

1027
01:12:28,833 --> 01:12:31,072
Get some sleep, child. You
have a long trip ahead of you.

1028
01:12:31,291 --> 01:12:32,570
Come along, darling.

1029
01:12:35,040 --> 01:12:37,823
All right, Harry. Drive
around to the stage entrance.

1030
01:12:38,039 --> 01:12:39,033
With pleasure.

1031
01:12:39,246 --> 01:12:42,942
I guess our engagement with Senhor
Cardoso was of the limited variety.

1032
01:12:43,162 --> 01:12:46,608
Don't worry. We'll find another country
where a dame can get you in trouble.

1033
01:12:46,827 --> 01:12:50,487
I can't figure that Lucia out. One moment
she's sweet as pie, and the next second, a heel.

1034
01:12:50,701 --> 01:12:52,028
What's in her mind?

1035
01:12:52,242 --> 01:12:54,565
Look, you got 32 slaps.
You wanna try for 64?

1036
01:12:54,783 --> 01:12:58,645
Let's grab a northbound boat and we switch
this time. You hang on the meat hook.

1037
01:12:58,865 --> 01:13:01,020
Oh, better tell the boys it's off.

1038
01:13:06,695 --> 01:13:08,900
We'll send you one of our
old straitjackets, huh?

1039
01:13:09,111 --> 01:13:10,603
Bye, fellas.
So long.

1040
01:13:10,819 --> 01:13:11,814
Adeus.

1041
01:13:19,775 --> 01:13:21,848
Come on, genius.
Let's grab the boat.

1042
01:13:26,522 --> 01:13:27,636
Uh-oh.

1043
01:13:27,855 --> 01:13:30,058
It's tall, dark and cyanide.

1044
01:13:33,728 --> 01:13:36,181
Good evening,
Mr. Sweeney, Mr. Barton.

1045
01:13:36,394 --> 01:13:37,886
Hi, Mrs. Vail.
Hiya, fellas.

1046
01:13:38,102 --> 01:13:40,636
What do you hear
from your embalmer?

1047
01:13:40,851 --> 01:13:43,599
I'm sorry.

1048
01:13:43,808 --> 01:13:45,087
Mr. Sweeney...
Yeah?

1049
01:13:45,308 --> 01:13:47,428
I'd like to make you and your
friend a business proposition.

1050
01:13:47,641 --> 01:13:50,803
Business? He's all ears.
What kind of a proposition?

1051
01:13:51,014 --> 01:13:52,969
Lucia's getting
married tomorrow.

1052
01:13:53,180 --> 01:13:56,177
I think it would be best for all
of us if she never saw you again.

1053
01:13:56,387 --> 01:14:01,292
I'm willing to give you
$10,000 to leave Brazil.

1054
01:14:01,510 --> 01:14:02,884
Ten grand?

1055
01:14:03,093 --> 01:14:05,498
That's a big deal. We'll have to
have some time to think this over.

1056
01:14:05,718 --> 01:14:09,046
You'll have to give us time.
Well, time's up. Where's the money?

1057
01:14:09,258 --> 01:14:11,663
Oh, really. I don't have it with me now.

1058
01:14:11,882 --> 01:14:15,081
Come along. We'll arrange
the details at my home.

1059
01:14:15,298 --> 01:14:16,328
Let's talk this over.

1060
01:14:16,547 --> 01:14:18,667
Let's get the money and talk
and count at the same time.

1061
01:14:18,880 --> 01:14:19,958
Happy thoughts.
Jolly.

1062
01:14:20,171 --> 01:14:23,251
We usually charge 15,000 to leave
countries. You're getting quite a bargain.

1063
01:14:23,462 --> 01:14:24,918
Straight to the vault, James.

1064
01:14:36,916 --> 01:14:39,201
Psst!

1065
01:14:51,869 --> 01:14:53,694
You can skip
the java, Mrs. Vail.

1066
01:14:53,910 --> 01:14:56,444
Never mind the coffee,
just pour the sugar, huh?

1067
01:14:56,659 --> 01:14:58,317
You're very
suspicious young men.

1068
01:14:58,533 --> 01:15:00,025
It's not that.
It's just that we're grown up.

1069
01:15:00,241 --> 01:15:03,357
This might be a plot to get rid of
us. The coffee might be poisoned.

1070
01:15:03,573 --> 01:15:05,729
Yeah, who knows,
this could...

1071
01:15:05,947 --> 01:15:08,067
Have you got any tea?

1072
01:15:08,280 --> 01:15:10,815
Very well. I'll put
your minds at ease.

1073
01:15:11,030 --> 01:15:12,486
Which would you
rather have?

1074
01:15:12,695 --> 01:15:15,858
Ten thousand in cash? Or
this piece of jewellery?

1075
01:15:16,069 --> 01:15:17,645
Personally, I look better
in the green stuff.

1076
01:15:17,860 --> 01:15:19,187
Just a minute.
My turn.

1077
01:15:19,401 --> 01:15:22,233
I'm afraid you've made
a very poor choice, gentlemen.

1078
01:15:22,442 --> 01:15:24,846
You see, this locket happens
to be worth $50,000.

1079
01:15:25,066 --> 01:15:26,060
Fifty...

1080
01:15:28,065 --> 01:15:31,560
The stone is one of the largest
and purest of star sapphires.

1081
01:15:31,772 --> 01:15:34,853
It was mined in Rangipour Province
of India many generations ago.

1082
01:15:35,062 --> 01:15:36,390
Way down there?

1083
01:15:36,604 --> 01:15:37,801
If you look closely,

1084
01:15:38,021 --> 01:15:41,467
you can see the iridescent
star of the true sapphire.

1085
01:15:41,686 --> 01:15:43,510
Look closely.

1086
01:15:43,727 --> 01:15:45,267
Closely.

1087
01:15:46,476 --> 01:15:49,260
Yeah. Yeah, I can see it.

1088
01:15:49,475 --> 01:15:53,419
Can you see it, Mr. Sweeney?
Look deep into the stone.

1089
01:15:53,640 --> 01:15:55,181
Now, do you see the star?

1090
01:15:55,389 --> 01:15:56,881
Yeah, I can see it.

1091
01:15:57,097 --> 01:15:58,092
Good.

1092
01:15:59,430 --> 01:16:01,550
Keep looking into the star.

1093
01:16:01,762 --> 01:16:04,510
You won't be
needing this?

1094
01:16:10,177 --> 01:16:12,960
Many years ago,
two men killed each other

1095
01:16:13,176 --> 01:16:15,876
in a struggle for the
possession of this stone.

1096
01:16:16,091 --> 01:16:18,839
One of them was
the Duke Duchampere.

1097
01:16:19,048 --> 01:16:23,372
A good-looking young man, who bore
a resemblance to you, Mr. Sweeney.

1098
01:16:24,546 --> 01:16:27,578
In fact, you are
the Duke Duchampere.

1099
01:16:27,795 --> 01:16:30,034
I am the Duke Duchampere.

1100
01:16:30,253 --> 01:16:32,706
The other man was
a certain Count Venescue.

1101
01:16:32,918 --> 01:16:34,660
I am the count.

1102
01:16:34,877 --> 01:16:37,660
Generation after generation,
gentlemen,

1103
01:16:37,876 --> 01:16:40,956
your two families have
hated each other.

1104
01:16:43,040 --> 01:16:44,995
I hate your family.

1105
01:16:46,123 --> 01:16:47,615
I hate yours.

1106
01:16:47,830 --> 01:16:50,400
This hatred has descended to you,

1107
01:16:50,621 --> 01:16:54,945
the last decadent offspring
of these noble ancestors.

1108
01:16:55,162 --> 01:16:56,736
Swine.

1109
01:16:56,952 --> 01:16:58,149
Pig.

1110
01:16:58,368 --> 01:17:00,158
That's the same as swine.

1111
01:17:00,368 --> 01:17:02,192
All right. Ham!

1112
01:17:02,409 --> 01:17:05,737
You both desire this stone.

1113
01:17:05,949 --> 01:17:08,188
You would kill to get it.

1114
01:17:08,407 --> 01:17:11,771
There's only one way: a duel.

1115
01:17:13,280 --> 01:17:14,654
A duel.
A duel.

1116
01:17:14,863 --> 01:17:16,983
A duel to the death.

1117
01:17:17,195 --> 01:17:18,901
A duel.
A duel.

1118
01:17:19,112 --> 01:17:20,652
To the death.

1119
01:17:20,861 --> 01:17:22,768
To the death.

1120
01:17:22,985 --> 01:17:24,442
A duel.

1121
01:17:26,276 --> 01:17:28,065
To the death.

1122
01:17:28,275 --> 01:17:29,850
Come, gentlemen.

1123
01:18:03,763 --> 01:18:05,172
Your pistols,
gentlemen.

1124
01:18:10,594 --> 01:18:13,128
Loaded, I trust?
It's easy to find out.

1125
01:18:13,343 --> 01:18:15,001
Not yet!

1126
01:18:15,218 --> 01:18:17,124
Not sporting, huh?

1127
01:18:21,882 --> 01:18:24,121
My man is ready, Baron.
Good.

1128
01:18:24,340 --> 01:18:26,081
You gentlemen
know the rules.

1129
01:18:26,298 --> 01:18:31,332
When I say go, take 10
paces, turn and fire.

1130
01:18:31,546 --> 01:18:35,289
Take 10 paces, turn and fire.
Take 10 paces, turn and fire.

1131
01:18:36,128 --> 01:18:37,834
Let's get out of here.

1132
01:18:43,584 --> 01:18:44,578
Go!

1133
01:18:46,457 --> 01:18:49,205
Well, dog,
why do you wait?

1134
01:18:49,415 --> 01:18:51,737
Haven't we
forgotten something?

1135
01:18:51,956 --> 01:18:54,787
Ah, yes.
The final insult.

1136
01:18:59,120 --> 01:19:01,275
Ten paces, turn and fire.

1137
01:19:01,494 --> 01:19:04,361
Ten paces, turn and...

1138
01:19:04,577 --> 01:19:05,571
Wait a minute.

1139
01:19:05,784 --> 01:19:07,241
Wait a minute.

1140
01:19:07,450 --> 01:19:08,646
What is this?

1141
01:19:08,867 --> 01:19:10,145
A gun!

1142
01:19:10,366 --> 01:19:12,191
Oh, I remember.

1143
01:19:12,407 --> 01:19:14,563
That dame,
she hypnotised us.

1144
01:19:14,781 --> 01:19:15,943
Aha!

1145
01:19:16,155 --> 01:19:19,023
You've got a gun too! She
wanted us to kill each other.

1146
01:19:19,238 --> 01:19:21,856
Boy, what a narrow
escape, huh, pal?

1147
01:19:22,070 --> 01:19:24,025
Ten paces, turn and fire.

1148
01:19:24,237 --> 01:19:25,398
Oh, now, duke. Duke!

1149
01:19:25,611 --> 01:19:27,187
Scat! I mean...

1150
01:19:27,402 --> 01:19:29,273
Scat, snap out of it!
Wake up!

1151
01:19:29,485 --> 01:19:31,605
You don't wanna kill me.
I'm your buddy, your friend!

1152
01:19:31,817 --> 01:19:33,227
It's no use,
Count Venescue.

1153
01:19:33,441 --> 01:19:35,313
But I'm not a count.
I'm not a count!

1154
01:19:35,525 --> 01:19:37,810
I'm just Hot Lips Barton,
a plain ordinary schmo!

1155
01:19:38,023 --> 01:19:39,765
I must avenge
the family honour.

1156
01:19:39,982 --> 01:19:41,390
What family? You haven't
even got a family!

1157
01:19:41,605 --> 01:19:44,010
You were left on a doorstep with
a bottle of milk, homogenised!

1158
01:19:44,230 --> 01:19:45,852
Ten paces, turn and fire.

1159
01:19:46,062 --> 01:19:47,851
Stop saying that, Scat!
You gotta listen to me.

1160
01:19:48,062 --> 01:19:49,685
We're friends, we're
practically brothers!

1161
01:19:49,894 --> 01:19:52,015
Blood is thicker than water,
and this is no time to prove it!

1162
01:19:52,227 --> 01:19:54,430
Besides, I wanna live.
I'm too young to die.

1163
01:19:54,643 --> 01:19:56,549
Too young, do you hear me?
Too young!

1164
01:20:00,516 --> 01:20:03,596
Let go, you swine.
That's the same as pig!

1165
01:20:03,807 --> 01:20:04,836
Eight...
No!

1166
01:20:05,056 --> 01:20:06,051
Nine...
No!

1167
01:20:06,264 --> 01:20:07,839
Ten paces!
No, no!

1168
01:20:08,055 --> 01:20:10,128
Walk some more!
You took short ones.

1169
01:20:10,346 --> 01:20:12,135
Turn...
Don't do it, pal!

1170
01:20:12,345 --> 01:20:13,885
Don't shoot!
You haven't got a licence!

1171
01:20:14,095 --> 01:20:16,131
Besides, I'm out of season! Please, don't!

1172
01:20:29,506 --> 01:20:30,880
Hot Lips!

1173
01:20:32,131 --> 01:20:33,671
Hot Lips!

1174
01:20:33,880 --> 01:20:35,537
Oh, my pal.

1175
01:20:35,754 --> 01:20:37,460
My buddy!

1176
01:20:37,671 --> 01:20:39,459
And I killed him.

1177
01:20:39,670 --> 01:20:44,823
Oh, when I think of all the gay,
carefree, happy times we've had together...

1178
01:20:45,043 --> 01:20:48,987
Now he's gone. I wonder where
he kept his life insurance.

1179
01:20:53,665 --> 01:20:56,235
Oh, I'll remember you like this,
partner.

1180
01:20:56,456 --> 01:20:59,986
Lying there in that beautiful
double-breasted, brown pinstripe.

1181
01:21:00,205 --> 01:21:02,111
Hardly even been worn!

1182
01:21:04,620 --> 01:21:07,403
Well, you've got me to thank for this.

1183
01:21:08,827 --> 01:21:11,149
I've lied to you, I've
double-crossed you, I've conned you,

1184
01:21:11,368 --> 01:21:13,488
ever since the day we first met.

1185
01:21:15,324 --> 01:21:17,030
Remember that gal in St. Louis?

1186
01:21:19,281 --> 01:21:23,937
The one that broke a date with you because she
had to go to the movies with her grandmother?

1187
01:21:25,154 --> 01:21:28,068
Well... I was Granny.

1188
01:21:29,861 --> 01:21:32,017
We didn't see much
of the picture.

1189
01:21:46,314 --> 01:21:48,600
You remember the 20 bucks
that disappeared in Cincinnati?

1190
01:21:49,480 --> 01:21:51,220
You thought your money belt
had sprung a leak.

1191
01:21:52,229 --> 01:21:56,517
I stole that 20 bucks
and bought myself a duck press.

1192
01:21:59,768 --> 01:22:01,046
Hot Lips!

1193
01:22:01,267 --> 01:22:03,257
You're alive!
Say something.

1194
01:22:03,475 --> 01:22:05,678
Give me that 20 bucks.
Let me help you.

1195
01:22:05,891 --> 01:22:08,971
Don't help me anymore, Granny.
You've helped me enough!

1196
01:22:12,014 --> 01:22:14,134
How do you like that?
Not even my size!

1197
01:22:14,347 --> 01:22:15,341
You wanna take it easy...

1198
01:22:15,554 --> 01:22:17,840
Lay off me,
you fat Benedict Arnold, you!

1199
01:22:18,886 --> 01:22:20,711
And another thing,
this deal about Lucia...

1200
01:22:20,928 --> 01:22:22,503
Wait a minute.
Lucia.

1201
01:22:22,718 --> 01:22:24,792
Yeah, what about her?
Don't you see?

1202
01:22:25,009 --> 01:22:26,715
The same thing that happened
to us happened to her.

1203
01:22:26,926 --> 01:22:28,548
That swinging
locket routine.

1204
01:22:28,758 --> 01:22:31,127
Deep, deep.

1205
01:22:31,341 --> 01:22:32,917
Stop it!
It makes me seasick.

1206
01:22:33,131 --> 01:22:35,536
That's the gimmick. That's how Mrs.
Vail gets her to do anything she wants.

1207
01:22:35,756 --> 01:22:37,248
That's why she's
marrying Mallory.

1208
01:22:37,464 --> 01:22:38,458
Poor kid.

1209
01:22:38,672 --> 01:22:40,957
Are we gonna stand by
and let her throw her life away?

1210
01:22:41,171 --> 01:22:42,498
Are we gonna take
the easy way out?

1211
01:22:42,712 --> 01:22:44,086
Yes, we are.

1212
01:22:44,295 --> 01:22:45,752
You're admitting
you're a dirty coward?

1213
01:22:45,961 --> 01:22:46,955
No, a clean one!

1214
01:22:47,169 --> 01:22:49,786
I've seen everything.
I've seen it all.

1215
01:22:50,001 --> 01:22:52,454
But never, never in a
lifetime of tears and laughter,

1216
01:22:52,667 --> 01:22:55,237
have I seen a guy walk out
on a gal who's nuts about him.

1217
01:22:55,458 --> 01:22:56,915
Well, you're seeing one
right now.

1218
01:22:57,123 --> 01:23:00,950
l...
You mean Lucia?

1219
01:23:01,164 --> 01:23:02,953
You mean she's nuts
about me?

1220
01:23:03,163 --> 01:23:04,869
She's dying to kiss
a trumpet player.

1221
01:23:05,080 --> 01:23:07,116
Oh, well, that figures.

1222
01:23:07,329 --> 01:23:11,534
It's nothing new to me. I've had
dolls blow their lid about me before.

1223
01:23:11,744 --> 01:23:14,279
Well, don't stand there. You
wanna be best man, don't you? Come!

1224
01:23:14,493 --> 01:23:15,737
Always was.

1225
01:23:17,700 --> 01:23:18,695
Howdy.

1226
01:23:20,116 --> 01:23:23,066
We would like to speak to Senhorita
de Andrade. We're friends of hers.

1227
01:23:23,282 --> 01:23:25,734
Ah, for that, you will
have to go to Campinas.

1228
01:23:25,948 --> 01:23:28,400
She's being married this
afternoon to Senhor Mallory.

1229
01:23:28,613 --> 01:23:30,271
This afternoon?
A big wedding.

1230
01:23:30,488 --> 01:23:32,063
The whole countryside
will be there.

1231
01:23:32,279 --> 01:23:34,269
How about people?
Everybody will attend.

1232
01:23:34,487 --> 01:23:35,481
Good day, senhores.

1233
01:23:41,317 --> 01:23:42,975
Everybody will be there but us.

1234
01:23:43,192 --> 01:23:45,644
How far is Campinas?
About 300 miles.

1235
01:23:45,857 --> 01:23:47,397
Walk faster.

1236
01:23:47,607 --> 01:23:50,060
Brother, we're stymied.
Not if we can hire a plane.

1237
01:23:50,273 --> 01:23:52,677
Hire a plane? We haven't got
enough to get an airmail stamp!

1238
01:23:52,897 --> 01:23:53,892
We'll get dough.

1239
01:23:54,104 --> 01:23:55,645
Sure, there's nothing to it.

1240
01:23:55,854 --> 01:23:59,432
A guy's gonna step out from behind a tree and say,
" Here, boys. Here's some dough. Hire a plane."

1241
01:23:59,645 --> 01:24:01,018
Psst! Gentlemen!

1242
01:24:03,393 --> 01:24:06,390
I wonder if this ever
happens in real life.

1243
01:24:06,601 --> 01:24:08,840
Mr. Sweeney,
Mr. Barton.

1244
01:24:09,058 --> 01:24:10,965
l...
Oops!

1245
01:24:12,766 --> 01:24:15,383
That's Eenie, Meenie and Mo.
My name is Rodrigues.

1246
01:24:15,598 --> 01:24:16,592
The fella in the radiogram.

1247
01:24:16,806 --> 01:24:20,335
I understand Lucia is
very fond of one of you.

1248
01:24:20,554 --> 01:24:22,674
You will do anything
to help her?

1249
01:24:24,178 --> 01:24:25,587
Remember,
it may mean your life.

1250
01:24:25,803 --> 01:24:27,792
I'll get the police.
No, no, no!

1251
01:24:28,010 --> 01:24:29,835
The police cannot
help us, not yet.

1252
01:24:30,051 --> 01:24:31,295
But you can.
How?

1253
01:24:31,509 --> 01:24:34,874
Gentlemen, hidden in a safe
in Mrs. Vail's bedroom

1254
01:24:35,091 --> 01:24:36,962
at the coffee plantation,
you will find...

1255
01:24:38,840 --> 01:24:39,834
the papers.

1256
01:24:42,838 --> 01:24:45,409
The papers?
Morning or evening papers?

1257
01:24:45,630 --> 01:24:47,619
They are in a long
manila envelope.

1258
01:24:47,837 --> 01:24:50,585
Find the envelope
and give it to the prefeito.

1259
01:24:50,795 --> 01:24:52,073
Prefeito? Sounds
like a dessert.

1260
01:24:52,294 --> 01:24:53,455
That's one of
the local big shots.

1261
01:24:53,668 --> 01:24:55,374
The prefeito will
be at the wedding.

1262
01:24:55,584 --> 01:24:57,456
He's a man we know
we can trust.

1263
01:24:57,667 --> 01:24:59,408
I don't get it.
How can the...

1264
01:25:00,874 --> 01:25:02,331
papers stop a wedding?

1265
01:25:02,540 --> 01:25:04,198
These papers can.
Ha-ha!

1266
01:25:04,415 --> 01:25:05,611
Gentlemen, you do
what I tell you.

1267
01:25:05,831 --> 01:25:07,158
Un momento.
Shh!

1268
01:25:10,205 --> 01:25:11,365
What do you think?
Fly to Campinas.

1269
01:25:11,579 --> 01:25:12,574
Get the papers.
Stop the wedding.

1270
01:25:12,787 --> 01:25:13,900
Foil Mrs. Vail.
Rescue Lucia.

1271
01:25:14,120 --> 01:25:15,281
Boy, what a finish.
Great.

1272
01:25:16,702 --> 01:25:18,076
Who was that?
The Warner Bros.

1273
01:25:18,285 --> 01:25:19,991
They're very jealous.
Thank you.

1274
01:25:20,950 --> 01:25:23,071
Now, here's the money.
Hire a plane.

1275
01:25:23,283 --> 01:25:25,274
My car will take you
to the airport. Come!

1276
01:25:25,491 --> 01:25:27,232
Hey, you're gonna go with us?

1277
01:25:27,449 --> 01:25:29,071
I'll be along later with help.
Fine.

1278
01:25:29,281 --> 01:25:31,272
Happy landings.
Goodbye.

1279
01:25:32,031 --> 01:25:33,108
Oops!

1280
01:25:37,945 --> 01:25:39,568
Break it up men,
we've had this already.

1281
01:26:00,063 --> 01:26:01,057
Oh, yes.

1282
01:26:04,478 --> 01:26:05,675
A nice landing.

1283
01:26:05,895 --> 01:26:07,849
Don't ever use the wheels,
it's better that way.

1284
01:26:08,061 --> 01:26:09,387
Picturesque place, isn't it?

1285
01:26:09,602 --> 01:26:12,634
Yeah. We gotta meet Chloe here.
She's featured here.

1286
01:26:12,850 --> 01:26:14,259
Look at this.
You all right?

1287
01:26:14,475 --> 01:26:17,721
Come, men, come.
There you are.

1288
01:26:17,931 --> 01:26:19,129
Pretty cosy in there,
wasn't it?

1289
01:26:19,349 --> 01:26:20,461
You're telling me.

1290
01:26:20,681 --> 01:26:22,090
Pay the man.
Uh-oh.

1291
01:26:22,306 --> 01:26:24,177
They went that way.
Pay the man.

1292
01:26:24,388 --> 01:26:26,425
Here you are.
There we are.

1293
01:26:26,638 --> 01:26:27,916
There we go.

1294
01:26:28,137 --> 01:26:31,999
Here, one for the copilot.
Nice work. And the hostess.

1295
01:26:32,218 --> 01:26:34,339
There you are.
Buy yourself a B-29.

1296
01:26:34,551 --> 01:26:36,873
Make our goodbyes to the rest
of the passengers. Thank you.

1297
01:26:37,092 --> 01:26:38,632
Which way's the hot dogs?
Over here.

1298
01:27:23,452 --> 01:27:24,565
When are they gonna
hold the wedding?

1299
01:27:24,784 --> 01:27:26,526
I'll find out.
Amigo?

1300
01:27:35,072 --> 01:27:38,069
We gotta find
those... papers pronto.

1301
01:27:38,280 --> 01:27:40,353
They're gonna start as soon
as the prefeito arrives.

1302
01:27:40,571 --> 01:27:43,603
He's liable to see a double-header:
Lucia's wedding and our funeral.

1303
01:27:43,820 --> 01:27:45,810
Round.
Huh? Uh-oh.

1304
01:27:48,319 --> 01:27:49,562
Mrs. Rigor-Mortis.

1305
01:27:52,193 --> 01:27:54,348
Let's see what's playing up
there on the mezzanine. Amigos!

1306
01:27:59,565 --> 01:28:01,970
Hey, do you believe in ghosts?

1307
01:28:07,271 --> 01:28:10,054
Who says opportunity
doesn't knock twice?

1308
01:28:26,847 --> 01:28:27,925
We lost them.

1309
01:28:28,139 --> 01:28:29,760
We better tell
Mrs. Vail. Come on.

1310
01:28:35,511 --> 01:28:37,300
Listen closely, child.

1311
01:28:37,510 --> 01:28:40,626
You're in the chapel.
My brother's at your side.

1312
01:28:40,843 --> 01:28:42,252
You're about to be married.

1313
01:28:43,717 --> 01:28:45,956
Lucia Maria de Andrade,

1314
01:28:46,175 --> 01:28:49,788
do you take this man to be
your lawfully wedded husband?

1315
01:28:50,006 --> 01:28:51,001
I do.

1316
01:28:51,922 --> 01:28:55,085
Come, child.
Time to get dressed.

1317
01:28:57,004 --> 01:28:58,201
Come on, let's go in.

1318
01:28:58,420 --> 01:28:59,415
What's playing in there?

1319
01:29:00,586 --> 01:29:01,580
The papers.

1320
01:29:01,794 --> 01:29:02,788
Oh!

1321
01:29:07,625 --> 01:29:09,496
Hey.
Don't do that!

1322
01:29:09,708 --> 01:29:10,952
Where's the safe?
Behind the painting.

1323
01:29:11,166 --> 01:29:12,160
Always is.

1324
01:29:15,956 --> 01:29:17,532
Any more ideas, fat man?

1325
01:29:19,830 --> 01:29:20,824
Oh!

1326
01:29:21,787 --> 01:29:22,782
Tilt!

1327
01:29:27,660 --> 01:29:28,904
They must've talked
to Rodrigues.

1328
01:29:29,118 --> 01:29:30,990
Don't worry, Mrs. Vail.
They'll never get the papers.

1329
01:29:31,200 --> 01:29:33,486
How do we know they
haven't got them already?

1330
01:29:40,781 --> 01:29:41,775
Twelve to the left.

1331
01:29:43,072 --> 01:29:44,066
Seven to the right.

1332
01:29:45,821 --> 01:29:46,816
Nine to the left.

1333
01:29:47,945 --> 01:29:49,852
... to the right.
What was that?

1334
01:29:50,069 --> 01:29:52,107
Five to the...
Five to the right.

1335
01:29:57,276 --> 01:29:58,733
The papers.

1336
01:29:58,941 --> 01:30:00,647
Lucky for all of us, they're still here.

1337
01:30:14,020 --> 01:30:16,721
Tony, you watch that door.
Harry, this one.

1338
01:30:16,935 --> 01:30:19,601
I think our friends
will be dropping by.

1339
01:30:19,810 --> 01:30:22,214
And this time, no games.

1340
01:30:27,890 --> 01:30:29,383
Let's crack this little crib, huh?

1341
01:30:29,598 --> 01:30:30,592
Those sneaks.

1342
01:30:35,054 --> 01:30:36,961
What's the matter with you?
We got the combination.

1343
01:30:37,178 --> 01:30:38,173
I was just reminiscing.

1344
01:30:40,469 --> 01:30:41,464
Hurry up.

1345
01:30:45,343 --> 01:30:46,670
The papers!
Shh!

1346
01:30:46,883 --> 01:30:48,341
If they hear us,
we're dead ducks.

1347
01:30:49,758 --> 01:30:51,334
Quack, quack!
Quack, quack!

1348
01:30:51,549 --> 01:30:52,544
Quack, quack!

1349
01:32:24,560 --> 01:32:26,596
Charge!

1350
01:33:38,285 --> 01:33:39,279
What's the matter with you?

1351
01:33:42,118 --> 01:33:44,072
"Everybody here
Likes chicken cacciatore"

1352
01:33:44,283 --> 01:33:45,859
"Everybody here
Likes chicken cacciatore"

1353
01:33:46,074 --> 01:33:49,320
"Oh! Oh!"

1354
01:33:49,532 --> 01:33:51,320
"And there's a few
Who like chopped chicken liver"

1355
01:33:51,531 --> 01:33:53,320
"And there's a few
Who like chopped chicken liver"

1356
01:33:53,530 --> 01:33:56,811
"Oh! Oh!"

1357
01:35:29,373 --> 01:35:31,162
Come on, Blanchard.
Knock them, Davis.

1358
01:35:36,870 --> 01:35:39,075
Faster!

1359
01:35:46,451 --> 01:35:48,073
Scat? Scat, where...?

1360
01:35:48,283 --> 01:35:49,692
Who? Oh, it's you.

1361
01:35:49,908 --> 01:35:50,903
Proceed, boy.

1362
01:36:01,946 --> 01:36:02,940
Prefeito!

1363
01:36:03,153 --> 01:36:04,148
Oh, this is it!

1364
01:36:04,362 --> 01:36:05,355
Fly, boy!

1365
01:36:05,569 --> 01:36:07,808
Okay, guys,
the party's over.

1366
01:36:08,027 --> 01:36:09,933
Help! Help!
Help!

1367
01:36:13,691 --> 01:36:16,440
Get the lead out of your horses!

1368
01:36:17,482 --> 01:36:18,679
Thieves!
Where are they?

1369
01:36:18,898 --> 01:36:20,177
Where are what?
Where's the papers?

1370
01:36:20,397 --> 01:36:22,388
Honest, fellas, we haven't got
any papers. We can't even read!

1371
01:36:22,605 --> 01:36:24,477
I wouldn't be caught dead with...
No use.

1372
01:36:24,688 --> 01:36:26,145
Huh?
We're cornered.

1373
01:36:26,354 --> 01:36:28,557
Fellas, the papers are
right in back of the clock.

1374
01:36:28,770 --> 01:36:30,843
That's right. Right there.
Back of that pendulum.

1375
01:36:31,061 --> 01:36:32,968
Stop horsing around.
Where's the papers?

1376
01:36:33,185 --> 01:36:35,340
We'll give you just 10
seconds to make up your mind.

1377
01:36:35,559 --> 01:36:37,845
Well, look. It's there.
One...

1378
01:36:38,059 --> 01:36:39,799
Right in back of the pendulum.
two...

1379
01:36:40,016 --> 01:36:41,178
Watch the pendulum.

1380
01:36:41,390 --> 01:36:42,385
Four,
Four,

1381
01:36:42,599 --> 01:36:43,593
five,
five,

1382
01:36:43,807 --> 01:36:44,801
six,
six,

1383
01:36:45,014 --> 01:36:46,886
seven, eight...
seven, eight...

1384
01:36:47,097 --> 01:36:49,467
Watch the pendulum.

1385
01:36:49,679 --> 01:36:51,302
Deep into the pendulum.

1386
01:36:52,387 --> 01:36:53,381
Deep.

1387
01:36:54,678 --> 01:36:56,052
Psst! Hey!

1388
01:37:03,133 --> 01:37:04,875
We seem to have them.
What do we do now?

1389
01:37:05,092 --> 01:37:06,085
Watch.

1390
01:37:07,673 --> 01:37:10,754
You are children, little
children, playing a game.

1391
01:37:10,964 --> 01:37:13,250
Playing patty-cake.
Yeah, yeah, patty-cake.

1392
01:37:17,712 --> 01:37:19,418
One of you cheats.
Naughty, naughty.

1393
01:37:19,628 --> 01:37:22,246
The other one doesn't like it.
You go faster and faster.

1394
01:37:22,461 --> 01:37:24,616
You're waiting for a chance
to get even. Faster and faster!

1395
01:37:24,834 --> 01:37:27,038
You're waiting for a signal.
A signal to slug each other.

1396
01:37:27,250 --> 01:37:28,873
And when we say "three,"
that's the signal.

1397
01:37:30,874 --> 01:37:33,492
One, two, three!

1398
01:37:34,457 --> 01:37:36,078
Whoo! Ha-ha!

1399
01:37:36,289 --> 01:37:37,746
That's what they get
for not seeing our pictures.

1400
01:37:37,955 --> 01:37:39,862
Come along!
Come along!

1401
01:37:55,699 --> 01:37:58,270
Wait! Look out!
Hey, wait a minute!

1402
01:37:58,490 --> 01:38:00,646
Hold everything! Look out!

1403
01:38:00,864 --> 01:38:02,855
Stop the wedding!
Yeah, return the presents!

1404
01:38:03,072 --> 01:38:04,813
Lucia?
I do.

1405
01:38:05,030 --> 01:38:06,024
I do.

1406
01:38:06,237 --> 01:38:08,227
Don't you see?
She's hypnotised.

1407
01:38:08,445 --> 01:38:10,067
Snap out of it,
honey, for me.

1408
01:38:10,903 --> 01:38:11,898
Baby?

1409
01:38:12,110 --> 01:38:13,105
Baby?

1410
01:38:13,319 --> 01:38:15,770
Sorry for this interruption.
These hoodlums don't belong here.

1411
01:38:15,984 --> 01:38:18,104
Are you gonna stand there...?

1412
01:38:18,317 --> 01:38:21,977
Just a second. Wait, sister! You're the one going
to the clink. This whole wedding is a frame-up!

1413
01:38:22,191 --> 01:38:24,808
Wait till you see what we got.
Yeah!

1414
01:38:25,023 --> 01:38:26,018
The papers!

1415
01:38:31,146 --> 01:38:32,887
What am I doing
in this wedding dress?

1416
01:38:33,103 --> 01:38:34,300
You're all right
now, baby.

1417
01:38:34,519 --> 01:38:36,972
Here you are, sir,
take a look at these papers.

1418
01:38:47,641 --> 01:38:50,388
Is he on our side?
Pull up the drawbridge!

1419
01:38:50,598 --> 01:38:51,971
What are you doing,
you fools?

1420
01:38:52,181 --> 01:38:56,090
We hate you.
We loathe you. We despise you.

1421
01:38:56,304 --> 01:38:57,299
Let me go!

1422
01:38:57,512 --> 01:39:01,753
We hate you.
We loathe you. We despise you.

1423
01:39:01,969 --> 01:39:03,545
Gentlemen, you
have all our thanks.

1424
01:39:03,760 --> 01:39:07,290
Your discovery of these papers has
prevented a horrible miscarriage of justice.

1425
01:39:07,508 --> 01:39:09,416
Papers stop a wedding?
I still don't get it.

1426
01:39:09,633 --> 01:39:10,627
Let's see.

1427
01:39:11,841 --> 01:39:12,835
Aha!

1428
01:39:13,673 --> 01:39:14,668
What does it say?

1429
01:39:15,423 --> 01:39:18,124
The world must
never know.

1430
01:39:23,128 --> 01:39:25,698
What do you know?
We never quite made it!

1431
01:39:25,920 --> 01:39:27,624
Exciting, though, wasn't it?

1432
01:39:44,580 --> 01:39:46,368
I'm sorry, nobody home.

1433
01:39:46,579 --> 01:39:48,451
Put the shoes out later,
will you?

1434
01:39:50,202 --> 01:39:51,743
You thought you'd
get away with it, huh?

1435
01:39:51,952 --> 01:39:53,742
Get away with what?
We're married, bud!

1436
01:39:53,951 --> 01:39:54,946
You're married?

1437
01:39:55,160 --> 01:39:58,524
I'm sorry, Scat.
This is the man I love.

1438
01:39:58,742 --> 01:40:00,364
My dream boy.

1439
01:40:00,574 --> 01:40:02,280
Oh, please, honey,
not in front of strangers.

1440
01:40:02,490 --> 01:40:04,813
Get a barrel and go over the
falls, son. We'll check with you.

1441
01:40:05,032 --> 01:40:08,312
How do you like this?
And close the door tight.

1442
01:40:08,530 --> 01:40:11,231
All the time I thought
she was in love with me.

1443
01:40:13,320 --> 01:40:14,314
Take it easy, honey.

1444
01:40:17,068 --> 01:40:19,817
This doesn't figure.
It doesn't figure at all.

1445
01:40:22,692 --> 01:40:23,770
Oh, I might've known.

1446
01:40:24,774 --> 01:40:26,053
Deep!

1447
01:40:29,981 --> 01:40:30,976
Deep!
