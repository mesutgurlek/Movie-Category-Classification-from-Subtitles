Byvalov - I. Ilyinsky

16
00:01:44,400 --> 00:01:47,560
The name Byvalov here stands
for Worldlywise.

17
00:01:51,200 --> 00:01:54,240
This bureaucrat is played
by Ilyinsky of all guys.

18
00:02:00,200 --> 00:02:04,000
The pilot is played by Volodin.
Good for him.

Meet the merry Waterman
Enacted by Pavel Olenev.

20

00:02:13,840 --> 00:02:17,800
Accountant Alexei Trubyshkin -

Letter-carrier - Lubov Orlova

23
00:02:23,040 --> 00:02:26,120
Letter-carrier Petrova,
Known here as Arrow,

24
00:02:29,600 --> 00:02:33,480
is played by Lubov Orlova

25
00:02:48,040 --> 00:02:50,160
Off we go.

26
00:03:23,400 --> 00:03:26,720
Nervous work is around here
on transport.

27
00:03:27,360 --> 00:03:30,160
Why nervous, you are just
lying here and smoking.

28
00:03:31,000 --> 00:03:32,480
A fat lot do you know.

29
00:03:32,800 --> 00:03:34,640
I've been a pilot
for thirty years

30
00:03:34,960 --> 00:03:38,520
and I never knew fear,
but now I don't know

31
00:03:38,840 --> 00:03:40,760
if I'll come back home
safe or not.

32
00:03:41,640 --> 00:03:43,480
Is the river so dangerous?

33
00:03:43,800 --> 00:03:46,320
Oh no. The river is quiet.

34
00:03:46,840 --> 00:03:49,960
It's the wire hawzer.
It's dangerous.

35
00:03:57,640 --> 00:03:59,240
What did I say?

36
00:04:00,120 --> 00:04:03,280
We'll stand idle for 3 hours
and there's an express here.

37
00:04:03,600 --> 00:04:06,480
An express should be delivered
within 40 minutes.

38
00:04:08,960 --> 00:04:10,720
Uncle Kuzya!

39
00:04:12,920 --> 00:04:14,880
Help the Communication
Ministry out!

40
00:04:15,240 --> 00:04:17,640
- What?
- Go to Domestic industries.

41
00:04:18,320 --> 00:04:22,680
Tell them there's an express
for them on the ferry.

42
00:04:24,720 --> 00:04:26,120
Right. Gee-up.

43
00:04:29,800 --> 00:04:32,840
- An express for who?
- Byvalov.

44
00:04:33,560 --> 00:04:37,720
There'll be a thunder
for this express.

45
00:04:41,600 --> 00:04:42,880
Close the door!

46
00:04:43,200 --> 00:04:45,040
Comrade Byvalov is busy.

47
00:04:46,040 --> 00:04:48,840
Byvalov I. I., Dpt head
small domestic industries

48
00:04:50,840 --> 00:04:52,800
- No telegram?
- Not yet.

49
00:04:54,040 --> 00:04:55,480
I wonder.

50
00:04:55,800 --> 00:04:59,240
I know how you feel.
Your life is work.

51
00:04:59,640 --> 00:05:03,480
It's amazing. A man
of elemental work capacity...

52
00:05:06,440 --> 00:05:08,880
Comrade Byvalov, I am getting
married.

53
00:05:09,520 --> 00:05:11,240
- Oh no.
- Close the door.

54
00:05:13,960 --> 00:05:15,920
You say elemental...

55
00:05:16,400 --> 00:05:19,200
I mean a man of elemental
work capacity...

56
00:05:20,360 --> 00:05:21,880
Can I come in?

57
00:05:22,480 --> 00:05:25,160
Zoya, what is going on?
I can't work.

58
00:05:25,920 --> 00:05:29,520
I am telling you in plain Russian,
Comrade Byvalov is busy.

59
00:05:34,040 --> 00:05:36,200
So you say "work capacity".

60
00:05:36,560 --> 00:05:39,480
I've worked under your guidance
for five years.

61
00:05:39,800 --> 00:05:42,600
We have changed 20 institutions

62
00:05:43,360 --> 00:05:46,080
getting closer
to Moscow every day.

63
00:05:46,400 --> 00:05:48,480
And when there are

64
00:05:48,840 --> 00:05:52,120
only three or four kilometers
left to reach Moscow,

65
00:05:52,760 --> 00:05:54,960
the likes of you

66
00:05:57,360 --> 00:05:59,280
are transferred to...

67
00:06:00,080 --> 00:06:03,840
...to some absolutely small
domestic industry.

68
00:06:04,360 --> 00:06:07,880
I just want to fret and fume,
fret and fume.

69
00:06:14,200 --> 00:06:15,840
Zoya Ivanovna...

70
00:06:18,200 --> 00:06:20,360
I've told you nothing.

71
00:06:21,000 --> 00:06:23,040
I'm waiting to be called
any minute.

72
00:06:23,440 --> 00:06:25,280
- From Moscow?
- From Moscow.

73
00:06:25,720 --> 00:06:27,520
- No telegram?
- Not yet.

74
00:06:27,960 --> 00:06:30,200
Really,
I want to fret and fume.

75
00:06:37,920 --> 00:06:40,760
You know what I want most
of all now?

76
00:06:41,240 --> 00:06:43,480
To fulfil your wishes.

77
00:06:44,240 --> 00:06:47,560
I would do whatever
you asked me to do.

78
00:06:48,320 --> 00:06:50,480
You'd ask - and I'd do it.

79
00:06:51,240 --> 00:06:53,840
You can ask me anything.

80
00:06:54,720 --> 00:06:58,760
Come to our rehearsal
from four to five.

81
00:07:00,040 --> 00:07:03,000
From 4 to 5? I can't.
I've got a rehearsal myself.

82
00:07:03,880 --> 00:07:05,800
- No hard feelings?
- None at all.

83
00:07:06,120 --> 00:07:09,760
Your rehearsal is my rehearsal.

84
00:07:10,160 --> 00:07:11,800
What are you--

85
00:07:12,240 --> 00:07:14,320
- What are you rehearsing today?
- Wagner.

86
00:07:15,000 --> 00:07:16,880
How boring.

87
00:07:18,040 --> 00:07:20,000
- No hard feelings?
- None at all.

88
00:07:20,600 --> 00:07:22,880
You just know nothing about
classical music.

89
00:07:23,240 --> 00:07:25,480
Look, it's just wonderful.

90
00:07:28,560 --> 00:07:30,400
The Death of Isolde.

91
00:07:44,520 --> 00:07:46,880
The part of tuba
is extraordinary.

92
00:07:56,200 --> 00:07:58,160
One-two...

93
00:07:58,840 --> 00:08:02,240
A pause for 47 bars.
We don't play them.

94
00:08:02,560 --> 00:08:04,000
Why not?

95
00:08:19,680 --> 00:08:22,080
What do you say about
The Death of Isolde?

96
00:08:22,400 --> 00:08:24,800
- She dies too long.
- Classically.

97
00:08:28,800 --> 00:08:31,360
So you say an outstanding
executive.

98
00:08:31,400 --> 00:08:33,760
I say an outstanding
executive like you...

99
00:08:36,320 --> 00:08:38,240
Comrades, close the door.

100
00:08:38,760 --> 00:08:41,600
Comrade Byvalov, try
to see my point.

101
00:08:43,680 --> 00:08:45,720
I'm telling you again

102
00:08:46,240 --> 00:08:48,680
I am waiting to be called
to Moscow any minute.

103
00:08:48,960 --> 00:08:51,480
I've no time for trifles.

104
00:08:52,240 --> 00:08:54,760
Listen to this sound.

105
00:08:55,800 --> 00:08:57,160
Like from a log.

106
00:08:58,000 --> 00:09:00,400
Sound... It takes an expert.

107
00:09:01,200 --> 00:09:03,680
I've played for 50 years.

108
00:09:13,520 --> 00:09:15,560
And I've never heard
such a bad sound.

109
00:09:15,800 --> 00:09:18,920
Ours is mass production.

110
00:09:19,640 --> 00:09:22,200
I can't afford to check

111
00:09:22,440 --> 00:09:24,880
every balalaika.

112
00:09:27,240 --> 00:09:29,920
I say, have you ever wanted

113
00:09:30,240 --> 00:09:31,720
to compose music yourself?

114
00:09:32,040 --> 00:09:33,800
Myself? Never.

115
00:09:35,120 --> 00:09:37,320
If I knew about music
as much as you do,

116
00:09:37,640 --> 00:09:39,160
I'd make music all the time.

117
00:09:39,960 --> 00:09:42,160
- You wouldn't get anywhere.
- Why not?

118
00:09:42,400 --> 00:09:45,320
You are a letter-carrier
not a composer.

119
00:09:45,800 --> 00:09:48,080
You think a letter-carrier
can't make music?

120
00:09:48,280 --> 00:09:50,320
- Of course not.
- Someone did.

121
00:09:50,520 --> 00:09:52,280
- Did what?
- A song.

122
00:09:52,520 --> 00:09:54,400
- Who?
- A letter-carrier.

123
00:09:54,840 --> 00:09:57,040
I can imagine. Who?

124
00:09:57,280 --> 00:09:59,600
- You don't know her.
- Not Zinka?

125
00:09:59,760 --> 00:10:02,440
No, not Zinka.
It's my friend, Dunya.

126
00:10:02,360 --> 00:10:04,240
I can imagine.

127
00:10:04,440 --> 00:10:08,240
What's so funny? First hear it,
then laugh.

128
00:10:08,640 --> 00:10:11,360
- Okay.
- Hey, toss me the accordion.

129
00:10:19,840 --> 00:10:22,880
Many a song has been sung
'bout the Volga.

130
00:10:23,400 --> 00:10:26,320
But the best one is yet
to be sung

131
00:10:27,040 --> 00:10:30,160
That would fly across
our Mother Volga

132
00:10:30,840 --> 00:10:33,560
In the bright rays
of our Soviet sun.

133
00:10:34,240 --> 00:10:37,160
O Volga, so beautiful,

134
00:10:37,600 --> 00:10:40,240
Like sea, you're full
and plentiful,

135
00:10:40,800 --> 00:10:43,960
Like life
you're free and bountiful,

136
00:10:44,720 --> 00:10:47,080
You are wide, deep and
powerful.

137
00:10:51,360 --> 00:10:54,000
Tell your Dunya she's a fool.

138
00:10:55,600 --> 00:10:58,480
- Well, really.
- Yes, really. I mean you...

139
00:10:59,400 --> 00:11:02,040
...in your group are just
fooling around.

140
00:11:02,280 --> 00:11:04,040
Fooling around?

141
00:11:04,160 --> 00:11:07,920
Uncle Kuzya plays the selfmade
trumpet better than you play.

142
00:11:08,120 --> 00:11:11,640
Kuzya plays better?
Some player!

143
00:11:12,520 --> 00:11:15,480
You've got a nice ensemble
uncle Kuzya, aunt Pasha,

144
00:11:15,720 --> 00:11:17,880
and now Dunya, a kind of
composer.

145
00:11:18,400 --> 00:11:21,120
An instrumental ensemble
"Make a cat laugh".

146
00:11:21,800 --> 00:11:25,400
Make a cat laugh? Well,
if you want my opinion,

147
00:11:25,720 --> 00:11:29,760
your orchestra is fit to play
in a milk shop in summer.

148
00:11:29,960 --> 00:11:32,680
- Why is that?
- All flies will die.

149
00:11:32,880 --> 00:11:34,440
Flies will die?

150
00:11:34,560 --> 00:11:37,400
There'll be neither flies,
nor the milkshop.

151
00:11:38,120 --> 00:11:40,640
Milk will turn sour from
your voices.

152
00:11:41,080 --> 00:11:43,320
Milk will turn sour?

153
00:11:46,160 --> 00:11:47,840
Comrade Byvalov!

154
00:11:50,280 --> 00:11:51,800
Comrade Byvalov!

155
00:11:53,760 --> 00:11:58,360
- What do you want?
- The letter-carrier has a cable for you.

156
00:11:58,520 --> 00:12:00,240
Give it to me.

157
00:12:02,000 --> 00:12:03,560
- Where is it?
- In the river.

158
00:12:04,040 --> 00:12:07,560
- Why in the river?
- Why, the ferry got stuck.

159
00:12:08,120 --> 00:12:09,480
Dammit.

160
00:12:10,200 --> 00:12:11,680
Send a boat there.

161
00:12:12,040 --> 00:12:15,240
The boats are being caulked
and can't be launched.

162
00:12:15,480 --> 00:12:16,880
Okhapkin!

163
00:12:18,080 --> 00:12:19,400
Okhapkin!

164
00:12:21,040 --> 00:12:22,840
- Here I am.
- Pick up the receiver.

165
00:12:23,080 --> 00:12:25,880
- Why?
- I'm gonna speak to you.

166
00:12:27,120 --> 00:12:29,040
My pleasure, I don't mind.

167
00:12:33,360 --> 00:12:35,280
Hello. Garage?

168
00:12:36,360 --> 00:12:38,120
Harness your mare.

169
00:12:39,480 --> 00:12:41,240
Harness your mare I say.

170
00:12:41,480 --> 00:12:42,760
Dammit.

171
00:12:42,960 --> 00:12:44,640
Harness your mare!

172
00:12:45,840 --> 00:12:47,360
Mare?

173
00:12:50,960 --> 00:12:52,240
How?

174
00:12:53,680 --> 00:12:54,960
I don't get it.

175
00:12:55,880 --> 00:12:57,520
What are you trying to say?

176
00:12:57,720 --> 00:13:00,600
The mare got unshod.
It needs shoeing.

177
00:13:01,360 --> 00:13:02,760
For shame!

178
00:13:03,000 --> 00:13:05,720
Moscow wants me and their mares
get unshod.

179
00:13:06,000 --> 00:13:09,960
- Okay. Hang up.
- My pleasure, I don't mind.

180
00:13:14,560 --> 00:13:17,520
It's ridiculous. I just want
to fret and fume.

181
00:13:19,480 --> 00:13:21,160
Hold it, hold it.

182
00:13:24,720 --> 00:13:27,240
Zoya, get the citizens' defectives

183
00:13:27,480 --> 00:13:29,160
and give them others.

184
00:13:29,360 --> 00:13:31,120
Citizens, follow me.

185
00:13:47,960 --> 00:13:49,920
Water
Beer

186
00:13:56,600 --> 00:13:58,680
Gee-up! Gee-up!

187
00:14:00,960 --> 00:14:04,240
Don't waste your breath.
She won't budge.

188
00:14:04,480 --> 00:14:05,840
Why not?

189
00:14:06,240 --> 00:14:10,520
She's used to stopping dead here
since early childhood.

190
00:14:13,800 --> 00:14:16,760
Until you treat her to some bread
and salt

191
00:14:17,000 --> 00:14:18,920
she won't move.

192
00:14:20,080 --> 00:14:24,600
I've been driving her for 15 years

193
00:14:25,040 --> 00:14:29,640
but I still don't have a clue
who taught her that.

194
00:14:37,240 --> 00:14:39,520
Here's a funny question, man:

195
00:14:41,520 --> 00:14:43,920
why am I a waterman?

196
00:14:46,000 --> 00:14:48,680
Without water everywhere

197
00:14:51,600 --> 00:14:54,560
You get neither here,
nor there.

198
00:15:17,160 --> 00:15:19,560
We drink water on vacations,

199
00:15:21,600 --> 00:15:24,160
Watery are our sessions.

200
00:15:26,360 --> 00:15:29,520
So without water everywhere

201
00:15:32,760 --> 00:15:35,760
You get neither here,
nor there.

202
00:15:41,160 --> 00:15:44,840
Bread and salt is a psychosis
with this gelding.

203
00:15:53,340 --> 00:15:55,220
My bandmen are no match
for your buffoons.

204
00:15:56,900 --> 00:16:00,300
Mine are cultured musicians.
No one beneath an accountant.

205
00:16:01,620 --> 00:16:04,620
- It's a Neapolitan band.
- Neapolitan?

206
00:16:04,860 --> 00:16:07,900
How strange. I thought it was
a double Italian one.

207
00:16:08,300 --> 00:16:11,140
The accountants play and you
conduct with a ruler.

208
00:16:12,580 --> 00:16:14,500
You are an office drudge.

209
00:16:15,060 --> 00:16:17,580
Me a drudge? And you... you...

210
00:16:18,220 --> 00:16:20,140
You are another,
you are another.

211
00:16:20,660 --> 00:16:22,100
Fool!

212
00:16:28,620 --> 00:16:29,900
Ferry ahoy!

213
00:16:30,980 --> 00:16:32,340
Ay-ay!

214
00:16:32,660 --> 00:16:34,140
Where is the cable?

215
00:16:35,020 --> 00:16:36,460
Right here.

216
00:16:39,220 --> 00:16:40,700
Read it.

217
00:16:43,940 --> 00:16:46,540
Moscow wants...

218
00:16:47,860 --> 00:16:49,260
Moscow...

219
00:16:51,700 --> 00:16:55,820
What did I say? Read on.

220
00:16:58,620 --> 00:17:00,500
Frustration...

221
00:17:01,820 --> 00:17:03,900
Participation...

222
00:17:05,220 --> 00:17:07,140
I can't hear you.

223
00:17:09,660 --> 00:17:11,580
In chorus, comrades.

224
00:17:13,980 --> 00:17:15,780
Participation!

225
00:17:25,620 --> 00:17:27,580
They want participation.

226
00:17:28,420 --> 00:17:29,820
Participation?

227
00:17:30,300 --> 00:17:33,980
No can do, comrades.
I am going to Moscow.

228
00:17:34,580 --> 00:17:37,740
- Ask my deputy.
- Participation...

229
00:17:38,300 --> 00:17:40,260
...Olympiad...

230
00:17:40,580 --> 00:17:43,100
...amateur arts.

231
00:17:46,100 --> 00:17:48,260
I don't get it.

232
00:17:49,180 --> 00:17:51,620
Delegation of your

233
00:17:53,020 --> 00:17:55,020
staff workers.

234
00:18:00,260 --> 00:18:02,460
A good beginning,

235
00:18:03,460 --> 00:18:05,460
"Moscow wants"

236
00:18:06,740 --> 00:18:08,980
but a lousy ending,

237
00:18:10,220 --> 00:18:11,660
"amateur arts".

238
00:18:15,100 --> 00:18:17,260
Anything else?

239
00:18:18,220 --> 00:18:20,100
Nothing. This is it.

240
00:18:26,540 --> 00:18:27,900
I'll answer.

241
00:18:29,180 --> 00:18:30,540
I'll ans...

242
00:18:36,580 --> 00:18:38,620
Hey Kuzma.

243
00:18:39,660 --> 00:18:42,060
Shout "I'll answer" with me.

244
00:18:42,820 --> 00:18:44,420
- I'll answer?
- Yes.

245
00:18:44,940 --> 00:18:46,780
- With you?
- Yes, yes.

246
00:18:46,940 --> 00:18:48,740
My voice...

247
00:18:48,980 --> 00:18:51,500
You've bungled it all

248
00:18:51,820 --> 00:18:53,940
and I will answer with you
for it?

249
00:18:54,300 --> 00:18:58,100
You just shout and I
will answer.

250
00:18:59,060 --> 00:19:02,780
If I shout and you answer,
it's a deal.

251
00:19:03,500 --> 00:19:05,820
In those merry days of old...

252
00:19:08,020 --> 00:19:09,380
Why are you shouting?

253
00:19:09,620 --> 00:19:12,020
Why not if you are going
to answer for it.

254
00:19:12,340 --> 00:19:15,940
Shout just what I will say.

255
00:19:16,660 --> 00:19:18,500
Shout "My reply".

256
00:19:19,300 --> 00:19:20,580
My reply.

257
00:19:21,740 --> 00:19:24,420
Shout now "top secret".

258
00:19:25,660 --> 00:19:28,940
Shout now top secret!

259
00:19:30,340 --> 00:19:32,460
Don't shout "shout now".

260
00:19:32,740 --> 00:19:35,940
Not to shout now?
When do I shout?

261
00:19:36,220 --> 00:19:39,060
Shout now, but don't shout now
"shout now",

262
00:19:39,260 --> 00:19:41,460
shout "top secret".

263
00:19:41,660 --> 00:19:43,740
Shout now, don't shout now.

264
00:19:44,020 --> 00:19:45,980
I don't dig.

265
00:19:47,140 --> 00:19:49,460
Shout now "top secret".

266
00:19:51,980 --> 00:19:54,540
I refuse to shout in secret.

267
00:19:56,820 --> 00:19:58,300
Comrades!

268
00:19:58,460 --> 00:20:01,780
Comrades, help me dictate
the cable.

269
00:20:02,820 --> 00:20:07,780
It's very important,
and top secret.

270
00:20:07,980 --> 00:20:09,980
In chorus.

271
00:20:11,660 --> 00:20:13,460
Top secret!

272
00:20:14,300 --> 00:20:16,300
Come on, come on,
more loudly.

273
00:20:17,420 --> 00:20:19,300
Top secret!

274
00:20:20,660 --> 00:20:21,940
Dictate it.

275
00:20:26,020 --> 00:20:28,460
Can't participate...

276
00:20:29,700 --> 00:20:31,020
in contest.

277
00:20:46,260 --> 00:20:48,420
Can't participate

278
00:20:49,300 --> 00:20:52,340
in contest due to absense

279
00:20:53,500 --> 00:20:56,060
of talent in my system.

280
00:21:09,940 --> 00:21:12,380
Hey, young man, you left this.

281
00:21:13,220 --> 00:21:15,500
- Left what?
- Death to flies.

282
00:21:21,540 --> 00:21:22,860
Here.

283
00:21:32,260 --> 00:21:33,980
Milk will turn sour.

284
00:21:36,940 --> 00:21:38,700
Nice band...

285
00:21:40,580 --> 00:21:43,100
And she has the cheek to say

286
00:21:43,500 --> 00:21:46,860
that lousy uncle Kuzya plays
the trumpet better than me.

287
00:21:48,660 --> 00:21:50,900
- Get off here.
- What's wrong?

288
00:21:51,500 --> 00:21:55,460
Better or worse, you are not
going with me.

289
00:21:55,820 --> 00:21:57,220
Why is that?

290
00:21:57,460 --> 00:22:00,380
Cos I'm Kuzya and the tank
is mine. Now get off.

291
00:22:10,980 --> 00:22:12,860
Comrade Byvalov!

292
00:22:13,580 --> 00:22:17,140
Take the paper and I refuse
to send your cable.

293
00:22:18,340 --> 00:22:20,100
How do you mean?

294
00:22:20,340 --> 00:22:22,500
You came here two weeks ago

295
00:22:22,700 --> 00:22:24,900
but you have the audacity to say

296
00:22:25,300 --> 00:22:27,460
that there is no talent
in our town.

297
00:22:27,660 --> 00:22:29,460
- That's right. So what?
- That's not true.

298
00:22:29,900 --> 00:22:31,700
We do have talents.

299
00:22:32,020 --> 00:22:34,860
Nonsense. There can no be talents
in this town.

300
00:22:36,540 --> 00:22:39,060
No talents?

301
00:22:42,020 --> 00:22:44,220
Do you know uncle Kuzya?

302
00:22:44,820 --> 00:22:46,620
Which uncle Kuzya?

303
00:22:47,580 --> 00:22:50,420
His niece Simka is a courier.

304
00:22:50,980 --> 00:22:53,060
Have you heard her sing
Tatiana?

305
00:22:53,220 --> 00:22:55,100
Which Tatiana?

306
00:22:55,540 --> 00:22:57,660
She starts so gently and softly...

307
00:22:58,700 --> 00:23:02,780
I drink a magic pois'n of wishes,

308
00:23:03,180 --> 00:23:05,580
My dreams are haunting me
like fishes.

309
00:23:06,060 --> 00:23:08,500
I see before me every moment

310
00:23:09,220 --> 00:23:11,620
My seducer. What a torment!

311
00:23:12,300 --> 00:23:14,300
Hold my bike.

312
00:23:14,580 --> 00:23:17,300
I see before me every moment...

313
00:23:26,980 --> 00:23:30,180
Nonsense. No one can sing
here so well.

314
00:23:31,300 --> 00:23:34,100
You have to study 20 years
to sing like that.

315
00:23:34,420 --> 00:23:36,340
Take your bike.

316
00:23:36,580 --> 00:23:38,020
And our carver Mishka...

317
00:23:38,380 --> 00:23:41,740
Isn't he talented? After he came
home from the rest-home

318
00:23:42,420 --> 00:23:44,620
he can recite "Demon" by heart.

319
00:23:45,060 --> 00:23:46,700
Hold the bike.

320
00:23:48,260 --> 00:23:51,300
I am the one he says
Not loved by anybody

321
00:23:52,260 --> 00:23:55,980
And cursed he says
by every living soul.

322
00:23:56,940 --> 00:24:00,540
I am the one he says
Who'll ruin the world.

323
00:24:01,780 --> 00:24:04,500
Stop your agitprop
and take your bike.

324
00:24:05,580 --> 00:24:08,420
I can't allow self-criticism
on the street.

325
00:24:09,420 --> 00:24:11,500
That's what the demon says.

326
00:24:11,820 --> 00:24:14,980
Demon or not, nobody is
allowed to speak this way.

327
00:24:16,900 --> 00:24:18,900
And our sticker Grishka...

328
00:24:19,300 --> 00:24:22,500
Isn't he talented? There are
44 figures in his Lesginka,

329
00:24:22,700 --> 00:24:24,620
if you will.

330
00:24:25,060 --> 00:24:26,780
Hold the bike.

331
00:24:27,340 --> 00:24:29,020
He dances this way...

332
00:24:37,940 --> 00:24:40,580
And that way, and that way too.

333
00:24:41,940 --> 00:24:43,900
Great guy.

334
00:24:58,620 --> 00:25:00,940
Everybody can lie about others.

335
00:25:01,620 --> 00:25:03,580
And what can YOU do?

336
00:25:04,500 --> 00:25:06,980
I don't think I can do something.

337
00:25:08,540 --> 00:25:10,780
That's not the point.
I'm a letter-carrier.

338
00:25:11,180 --> 00:25:13,980
Anyway, I am not going to send
that cable.

339
00:25:14,300 --> 00:25:16,420
You are not? Why not?

340
00:25:19,740 --> 00:25:22,580
Because we do have talents.
I'm going to prove this.

341
00:25:23,220 --> 00:25:24,740
You can't.

342
00:25:25,500 --> 00:25:27,100
I will.

343
00:25:27,380 --> 00:25:29,220
Give me my bike.

344
00:25:31,860 --> 00:25:33,900
Hey, give me my newspaper.

345
00:25:36,300 --> 00:25:37,900
Garage

346
00:25:42,220 --> 00:25:43,500
Okhapkin!

347
00:25:44,980 --> 00:25:47,060
Which Okhapkin?

348
00:25:48,340 --> 00:25:50,740
I'm the local sweeper.

349
00:25:53,020 --> 00:25:54,740
- You frightened me.
- What is it?

350
00:25:55,060 --> 00:25:57,660
- You must dance.
- Always ready and willing.

351
00:25:59,300 --> 00:26:01,660
Get the orchestras.
All of them.

352
00:26:08,660 --> 00:26:10,660
Don't let me down, Philipp.

353
00:26:10,980 --> 00:26:13,940
- I don't know the words.
- The voice is more important.

354
00:26:14,500 --> 00:26:16,740
You can sing whatever you like.
Even this.

355
00:26:18,500 --> 00:26:21,180
Good. Don't let me down.

356
00:26:37,960 --> 00:26:39,720
What can you offer me?

357
00:26:40,400 --> 00:26:43,600
From olden times
we have the kvass

358
00:26:45,600 --> 00:26:48,600
Highly prized by gourmets.

359
00:26:52,920 --> 00:26:56,320
There's fine beverage Kavkaz,

360
00:27:00,160 --> 00:27:03,440
Like the Terek it froths
and plays.

361
00:27:12,400 --> 00:27:15,280
I would speshly offer you,
dear -

362
00:27:19,040 --> 00:27:22,360
It flows freely
and easily -

363
00:27:24,640 --> 00:27:27,760
The renowned Volga beer

364
00:27:31,880 --> 00:27:34,680
Of the famous brand Zhiguli.

365
00:27:52,360 --> 00:27:55,160
Is there anybody other than you?

366
00:27:55,520 --> 00:27:57,800
You bet there is.

367
00:27:57,780 --> 00:28:00,020
Here is a quartet.

368
00:28:05,540 --> 00:28:09,180
Stop mockery and idle
talk, talk, talk

369
00:28:10,180 --> 00:28:13,460
That our Soviet cook
wastes the food,

370
00:28:14,300 --> 00:28:16,500
Wastes the food.

371
00:28:23,220 --> 00:28:26,700
Believe me at the food
front, front, front

372
00:28:27,780 --> 00:28:30,580
We score a thou, a thou, a thou

373
00:28:33,660 --> 00:28:36,700
A thousand victories, I grant.

374
00:28:39,260 --> 00:28:40,820
What's with you?

375
00:28:41,260 --> 00:28:43,940
- Let's go in.
- Thanks, I've had my lunch.

376
00:28:44,780 --> 00:28:46,940
But I can't have mine.

377
00:28:47,340 --> 00:28:49,500
The chefs are all drunk there.

378
00:28:49,860 --> 00:28:53,140
I can't leave my beat.
I better call in the sweeper.

379
00:29:22,740 --> 00:29:25,260
Watch me, comrade Byvalov.

380
00:29:28,100 --> 00:29:29,700
The new batch is a lot better.
You're gonna like it.

381
00:29:29,860 --> 00:29:31,140
Louder.

382
00:29:49,460 --> 00:29:52,460
Like a nightingale we sing.

383
00:29:54,060 --> 00:29:56,420
Our clear song

384
00:29:57,820 --> 00:30:00,620
Rings across, rings across

385
00:30:01,220 --> 00:30:03,700
Our hometown.

386
00:30:05,460 --> 00:30:08,700
Like a nightingale we sing.

387
00:30:09,740 --> 00:30:11,780
Our clear song

388
00:30:13,540 --> 00:30:16,300
Rings across, rings across

389
00:30:17,220 --> 00:30:19,220
Our hometown.

390
00:30:43,260 --> 00:30:45,780
Take your pair's hand,

391
00:30:46,500 --> 00:30:48,420
Welcome our green friend.

392
00:30:49,300 --> 00:30:52,060
Conifer-clad
with a pitch leg,

393
00:30:52,580 --> 00:30:54,980
With frost all aglow.

394
00:30:56,580 --> 00:30:57,860
- Hello!
- Hello.

395
00:31:29,260 --> 00:31:31,580
Dear Volga, Mother Volga,

396
00:31:32,860 --> 00:31:35,300
Our Russian river, Oh!

397
00:31:37,300 --> 00:31:39,540
Have you ever got a present

398
00:31:41,580 --> 00:31:43,740
From a Cossack from the Don.

399
00:31:48,100 --> 00:31:49,820
Yo, heave-ho,

400
00:31:50,020 --> 00:31:52,140
Yo, heave-ho.

401
00:31:54,220 --> 00:31:58,420
Clad in moss it stands there
For a thousandth year

402
00:31:59,420 --> 00:32:02,820
Knowing neither concern,
nor care.

403
00:32:26,980 --> 00:32:31,460
You still think we have no
talent in our town?

404
00:32:32,260 --> 00:32:35,940
Who d'you think you are?
You and your talents!

405
00:32:36,540 --> 00:32:38,740
Don't listen to her,
comrade Byvalov.

406
00:32:39,020 --> 00:32:44,100
- I have got all the talents.
- The cheek! What talents, where?

407
00:32:45,620 --> 00:32:47,820
Right here. Full complement.

408
00:32:48,340 --> 00:32:49,660
Here we go, guys.

409
00:32:54,780 --> 00:32:57,340
Everything that we have dreamt of
is a-coming true,

410
00:32:57,780 --> 00:33:00,220
To the sun our ambitions
are a-breaking through.

411
00:33:00,580 --> 00:33:03,500
We'll awaken everyone
We'll get everything we plan,

412
00:33:03,740 --> 00:33:05,780
Like an ear our exuberance
is a-ripening.

413
00:33:22,180 --> 00:33:23,460
He is gone.

414
00:33:24,220 --> 00:33:25,500
Follow me.

415
00:33:27,620 --> 00:33:30,100
An elderly woman kept
a grey little kid,

416
00:33:30,500 --> 00:33:33,380
An elderly woman kept
a grey little kid,

417
00:33:35,260 --> 00:33:38,100
That's true, that's true,
a grey little kid.

418
00:33:38,980 --> 00:33:41,740
That's true, that's true,
a grey little kid.

419
00:33:45,100 --> 00:33:48,660
Near the wood maple-trees
are a-bloss'ming,

420
00:33:49,540 --> 00:33:52,620
Old men and women are dancing
and gossiping.

421
00:33:55,340 --> 00:33:58,580
That's true, that's true,
dancing and gossiping.

422
00:34:32,540 --> 00:34:35,300
Hey, what do you want with me?

423
00:34:35,820 --> 00:34:37,780
I want you to send our guys

424
00:34:38,020 --> 00:34:40,740
to the Moscow Olympiad.

425
00:34:41,580 --> 00:34:43,740
Oh yeah?

426
00:34:44,260 --> 00:34:46,020
No way.

427
00:34:47,460 --> 00:34:50,540
- Nonsense.
- Stuff and nonsense.

428
00:34:51,500 --> 00:34:55,180
You better take along just
our orchestra.

429
00:34:55,380 --> 00:34:57,220
- Hear me out.
- Wait, wait.

430
00:34:58,060 --> 00:35:01,220
Are you saying I take it?

431
00:35:02,180 --> 00:35:04,220
- To Moscow?
- Right.

432
00:35:04,620 --> 00:35:07,220
Look, you are a real talent.

433
00:35:09,460 --> 00:35:10,940
Well, that's--

434
00:35:11,140 --> 00:35:12,780
To Moscow!

435
00:35:15,620 --> 00:35:17,940
Melkovodsk (Shallow Water) dock

436
00:35:23,860 --> 00:35:27,660
America gave Russia
a steamer, yes.

437
00:35:29,260 --> 00:35:30,820
"Sturgeon"

438
00:35:33,340 --> 00:35:35,140
Steam at the head,

439
00:35:38,020 --> 00:35:40,260
Wheels at the stern

440
00:35:42,500 --> 00:35:46,380
And she moves
at a snail's pace.

441
00:35:49,780 --> 00:35:51,740
At a snail's pace.

442
00:35:53,740 --> 00:35:55,780
That's a good boat.

443
00:35:56,100 --> 00:35:59,100
Yeah, she's good,
only water shy.

444
00:36:00,580 --> 00:36:03,180
How long haven't you
piloted it?

445
00:36:03,980 --> 00:36:05,860
Fifteen navigations.

446
00:36:06,140 --> 00:36:08,700
- Not lost the art, have you?
- For goodness sake!

447
00:36:08,940 --> 00:36:10,700
Hands of gold!

448
00:36:10,860 --> 00:36:14,580
How long has this boat
stood idle?

449
00:36:15,300 --> 00:36:17,020
About 30 years.

450
00:36:18,020 --> 00:36:21,660
And we have overhauled it
in just two weeks.

451
00:36:22,860 --> 00:36:24,460
Two weeks.

452
00:36:24,940 --> 00:36:26,260
Beautiful.

453
00:36:28,300 --> 00:36:29,940
Careful.

454
00:36:30,060 --> 00:36:33,260
It's a good boat, yes,
but not to be touched with hands.

455
00:36:35,840 --> 00:36:37,320
Come on, guys, move it.

456
00:36:38,120 --> 00:36:40,120
- Tickets please.
- What tickets?

457
00:36:44,840 --> 00:36:47,080
Are you going too?

458
00:36:48,040 --> 00:36:50,480
- Yep.
- What's this? Your baggage?

459
00:36:51,560 --> 00:36:54,360
Quite a lot. Carriers, leave
them here for a while.

460
00:36:54,920 --> 00:36:57,840
Comrades performers, welcome
to the saloon.

461
00:37:06,440 --> 00:37:08,040
Not you.

462
00:37:08,240 --> 00:37:11,920
Your baggage will do. Strangers,
clear the deck.

463
00:37:13,200 --> 00:37:15,440
Only performers are allowed here.

464
00:37:15,720 --> 00:37:18,240
Comrade Byvalov,
he is our performer.

465
00:37:19,400 --> 00:37:22,720
Rubbish. He's not your performer,
he is my water carrier.

466
00:37:23,200 --> 00:37:26,160
Can't a water carrier be
a performer?

467
00:37:26,840 --> 00:37:30,600
Some other chief's water carrier
can be but not mine.

468
00:37:30,840 --> 00:37:33,520
That's impossible.

469
00:37:35,120 --> 00:37:38,520
I AM a performer, I swear.

470
00:37:39,320 --> 00:37:41,480
Ask Philipp.

471
00:37:41,720 --> 00:37:44,000
He's a waiter, he won't
tell lies.

472
00:37:44,240 --> 00:37:46,680
We perform without
discontinuing work.

473
00:37:47,000 --> 00:37:48,800
Comrade policeman,

474
00:37:49,320 --> 00:37:52,320
stop this disgrace.
Get them out of the boat.

475
00:37:52,640 --> 00:37:54,840
I am a performer too.

476
00:37:54,960 --> 00:37:57,720
Can't you see? This is my group.

477
00:37:58,400 --> 00:38:01,840
We won the contest and
we can go to Moscow.

478
00:38:03,200 --> 00:38:05,760
- Just as them.
- Just as us?

479
00:38:06,440 --> 00:38:09,520
We take to Moscow Beethoven,
Mozart, Schubert, Wagner.

480
00:38:10,000 --> 00:38:11,720
And you?

481
00:38:12,040 --> 00:38:15,280
And we take... eh... aunt Pasha,
uncle Kuzya.

482
00:38:16,120 --> 00:38:17,280
How can you compare Beethoven
with some uncle?

483
00:38:17,960 --> 00:38:21,280
Big deal. Beethoven might
have been someone's uncle, too.

484
00:38:22,640 --> 00:38:25,640
Beethoven an uncle?
Well, that's too much.

485
00:38:26,160 --> 00:38:27,800
Who d'you think you are?

486
00:38:28,360 --> 00:38:30,480
- I'm Arrow.
- No nicknames here.

487
00:38:30,600 --> 00:38:33,000
- Your trade.
- A letter-carrier.

488
00:38:34,280 --> 00:38:37,560
Well, let the Communications
Ministry carry you.

489
00:38:39,120 --> 00:38:41,400
My responsibility are

490
00:38:42,040 --> 00:38:44,080
workers in my system.

491
00:38:44,320 --> 00:38:48,240
- What are you?
- I am a reciter.

492
00:38:48,640 --> 00:38:50,560
For what institution
do you recite?

493
00:38:51,280 --> 00:38:53,240
I don't recite for an institution,

494
00:38:53,480 --> 00:38:55,440
I recite Mayakovsky.

495
00:38:55,680 --> 00:38:58,440
- Your place of work?
- Kitchen.

496
00:38:59,240 --> 00:39:00,880
- I am a chef.
- Who?

497
00:39:01,640 --> 00:39:03,680
- A cook.
- So, it's the food industry?

498
00:39:04,600 --> 00:39:06,560
- Clear the deck.
- Thanks.

499
00:39:09,440 --> 00:39:11,760
- Clear the way.
- Arrow!

500
00:39:38,180 --> 00:39:39,980
Take care.

501
00:39:50,300 --> 00:39:52,220
Why didn't they take you?

502
00:39:52,860 --> 00:39:54,940
We don't want to go with them.

503
00:39:55,260 --> 00:39:56,540
Why not?

504
00:39:56,820 --> 00:39:59,260
We pursue different artistic trends.

505
00:39:59,380 --> 00:40:01,300
You mean parted ways.

506
00:40:02,340 --> 00:40:05,020
We have to wait 4 days
for the passenger boat.

507
00:40:05,900 --> 00:40:08,660
Why waste time?

508
00:40:09,060 --> 00:40:12,060
I can lead you to the Chusovaya
across the mountains

509
00:40:13,060 --> 00:40:16,380
and we'll raft it to the Volga
before them.

510
00:40:17,180 --> 00:40:21,420
- Is the Chusovaya far?
- No. 3 days of trekking.

511
00:40:22,380 --> 00:40:26,380
Swamps, woods and a little
of good track.

512
00:40:27,260 --> 00:40:28,620
Good track? Okay, let's go.

513
00:40:28,900 --> 00:40:30,220
Off we go, guys.

514
00:40:34,220 --> 00:40:36,860
First day

515
00:40:40,700 --> 00:40:43,060
Second day

516
00:40:49,780 --> 00:40:51,740
Third day

517
00:41:24,500 --> 00:41:26,900
We play just 80 bars.

518
00:41:28,660 --> 00:41:31,860
The first violins' liabilities
are 23 late comings

519
00:41:32,140 --> 00:41:33,980
and forte instead of piano.

520
00:41:34,180 --> 00:41:36,900
The violas played out of key
4 wholes at the start

521
00:41:37,060 --> 00:41:39,020
and 8 tenths in the end.

522
00:41:41,140 --> 00:41:43,940
All in all, comrades, 75 bars
of pure falsehood.

523
00:41:44,620 --> 00:41:47,860
Given this balance, it's a shame
to go to Moscow. All over again.

524
00:41:48,180 --> 00:41:50,940
Tactful guidance you say?

525
00:41:51,300 --> 00:41:54,020
The phrase about the guidance

526
00:41:54,420 --> 00:41:55,820
should be reinforced.

527
00:41:56,420 --> 00:42:00,180
I would say, "Owing to my tactful
guidance".

528
00:42:00,980 --> 00:42:02,500
- Mine?
- Yours.

529
00:42:03,260 --> 00:42:04,660
Right.

530
00:42:15,420 --> 00:42:17,260
Attention everybody.

531
00:42:17,660 --> 00:42:20,260
Let me read the draft
of my future speech.

532
00:42:25,820 --> 00:42:27,780
Comrades Muscovites!

533
00:42:28,180 --> 00:42:30,100
You see before you

534
00:42:30,340 --> 00:42:33,740
a formidable body
of amateur talent

535
00:42:34,420 --> 00:42:36,540
mostly raised

536
00:42:37,180 --> 00:42:40,100
within my system

537
00:42:41,060 --> 00:42:46,020
owing to my tactful guidance.

538
00:42:47,540 --> 00:42:50,740
- What do you say?
- Good. For you.

539
00:43:08,180 --> 00:43:12,540
Don't you think I should
emphasize the thesis

540
00:43:13,580 --> 00:43:15,940
on my tactful guidance?

541
00:43:16,420 --> 00:43:19,860
We are rehearsing the Musical
Moment by Schubert

542
00:43:20,660 --> 00:43:22,460
and you are interfering.

543
00:43:23,700 --> 00:43:25,660
What do you mean interfering?

544
00:43:26,060 --> 00:43:29,300
Do you mean the moment
of my guidance

545
00:43:29,900 --> 00:43:33,140
is less important
than the Musical Moment

546
00:43:33,580 --> 00:43:35,180
by Schulbert?

547
00:44:38,620 --> 00:44:41,140
The golden mist is playing
in the air.

548
00:44:41,500 --> 00:44:44,100
Oh, youthful joy,
you are beyond belief.

549
00:44:44,340 --> 00:44:47,060
High as the sky,
Vast as the sea

550
00:44:47,220 --> 00:44:49,740
Is our young road indeed.

551
00:44:50,140 --> 00:44:52,420
Sing everybody.

552
00:44:53,220 --> 00:44:55,500
Sing everybody.

553
00:44:56,020 --> 00:44:58,780
High as the sky,
Vast as the sea

554
00:44:59,220 --> 00:45:01,260
Is our young road indeed.

555
00:46:01,580 --> 00:46:03,420
WOODCUTTER

556
00:46:27,700 --> 00:46:30,340
Everything that we have dreamt of
is a-coming true.

557
00:46:30,580 --> 00:46:33,300
To the sun our ambitions
are a-breaking through.

558
00:46:33,580 --> 00:46:36,460
We'll awaken everyone,
We'll get everything we plan.

559
00:46:36,860 --> 00:46:39,140
Like an ear our exuberance
is ripening.

560
00:46:39,380 --> 00:46:41,780
Sing everybody.

561
00:46:42,420 --> 00:46:44,860
Sing everybody.

562
00:46:45,100 --> 00:46:48,100
We'll awaken everyone,
We'll get everything we plan.

563
00:46:48,220 --> 00:46:50,740
Like an ear our exuberance
is ripening.

564
00:46:56,740 --> 00:46:59,540
Our young legs beg for dancing
And we dance with zest.

565
00:46:59,740 --> 00:47:02,580
Our songs are ringing clear
without letup or rest.

566
00:47:02,780 --> 00:47:05,380
Come out, girl,
Look at your beau

567
00:47:05,500 --> 00:47:08,060
And bandy merry words of jest.

568
00:47:27,860 --> 00:47:30,740
- A rousing act.
- They sing well.

569
00:47:30,980 --> 00:47:32,340
Well.

570
00:47:32,780 --> 00:47:35,220
Yes, well. Good on them.

571
00:47:35,540 --> 00:47:36,980
Good on them.

572
00:47:38,100 --> 00:47:39,380
Bad on them.

573
00:47:43,140 --> 00:47:44,420
Shallow-waterers!

574
00:47:44,940 --> 00:47:47,820
- What's going on?
- They're overtaking us.

575
00:47:48,060 --> 00:47:49,340
Bastards.

576
00:47:50,700 --> 00:47:52,100
Full steam!

577
00:47:53,500 --> 00:47:55,740
Comrades, they are overtaking us.

578
00:47:56,420 --> 00:47:58,020
Impostors!

579
00:48:03,540 --> 00:48:05,980
If they get to Moscow before us

580
00:48:06,260 --> 00:48:08,300
our region will be disgraced.

581
00:48:08,900 --> 00:48:10,180
Full steam!

582
00:48:10,620 --> 00:48:12,420
- Full steam!
- Full steam!

583
00:48:12,900 --> 00:48:15,420
- Full steam ahead!
- Fullest steam!

584
00:48:15,860 --> 00:48:17,420
Fullest steam!

585
00:48:17,500 --> 00:48:20,100
Two guys won't cope.

586
00:48:20,860 --> 00:48:22,940
We need help.

587
00:48:23,500 --> 00:48:24,940
Comrades!

588
00:48:27,700 --> 00:48:30,620
Let's help our stokers.

589
00:48:34,940 --> 00:48:36,580
To the fire-chambers, my friends!

590
00:48:39,820 --> 00:48:41,220
To the fire-chambers!

591
00:49:24,540 --> 00:49:25,940
Alyosha!

592
00:49:26,780 --> 00:49:28,100
Alyosha!

593
00:49:34,500 --> 00:49:36,380
Hey, add more steam!

594
00:49:38,860 --> 00:49:41,180
Speed up, you mustached devil.

595
00:49:42,260 --> 00:49:43,580
Do it!

596
00:49:45,100 --> 00:49:48,220
- They're leaving us behind!
- Do something!

597
00:50:13,500 --> 00:50:15,260
Why did we stop?

598
00:50:15,580 --> 00:50:18,180
We are out of gas.

599
00:50:18,380 --> 00:50:20,300
No wind.

600
00:51:05,940 --> 00:51:07,260
Am I in a stew!

601
00:51:10,940 --> 00:51:12,300
Hey there.

602
00:51:14,500 --> 00:51:18,700
Those racers wanted to outdo
a two-funnel giant.

603
00:51:19,260 --> 00:51:22,900
No way, baby. You can't go far
without a funnel.

604
00:51:31,500 --> 00:51:34,420
And we can well use one.

605
00:51:35,140 --> 00:51:36,500
Full steam!

606
00:51:44,180 --> 00:51:46,020
Fourth day

607
00:51:48,220 --> 00:51:50,220
The Kama. The Volga.

608
00:52:09,080 --> 00:52:12,960
I'm a sailor, I've been places,
Navigated lots of vessels.

609
00:52:13,600 --> 00:52:17,520
But I never told a lie,
I am not that kind of guy.

610
00:52:18,080 --> 00:52:22,240
Yes, I'll never tell a lie,
I am not that kind of guy.

611
00:52:23,040 --> 00:52:27,440
I'm an expert pilot, trust me.
I know rivers inside out.

612
00:52:28,000 --> 00:52:32,160
All the shallows and sandbanks -
Do believe me - I can count.

613
00:52:36,280 --> 00:52:40,760
Yes, all shallows and sandbanks -
Do believe me - I can count.

614
00:53:06,080 --> 00:53:08,520
Watch out. You may run aground.

615
00:53:09,400 --> 00:53:11,360
Teaching your mother
to hatch eggs?

616
00:53:11,880 --> 00:53:13,920
I know every bank around here.

617
00:53:29,480 --> 00:53:31,600
Old devil! You boasted

618
00:53:32,080 --> 00:53:34,280
you know every bank around here.

619
00:53:34,920 --> 00:53:38,280
Of course, I know.
That's sandbank number one.

620
00:53:40,040 --> 00:53:43,160
Just you wait
till you come back.

621
00:53:44,880 --> 00:53:47,960
I am no fool to come back.

622
00:53:54,760 --> 00:53:56,840
Fifth day

623
00:54:08,020 --> 00:54:10,580
Hey buddies, come to me.

624
00:54:15,020 --> 00:54:17,140
I've come to you. Moor here.

625
00:54:23,060 --> 00:54:24,460
I've come to you.

626
00:54:33,220 --> 00:54:35,260
You can't sail without me anyway.

627
00:54:35,700 --> 00:54:38,420
- Welcome.
- You need an expert.

628
00:54:39,540 --> 00:54:41,660
Hands of gold.

629
00:54:49,020 --> 00:54:53,300
If I take it in my hands
sandbanks are no problem.

630
00:54:54,380 --> 00:54:58,340
And my own brother too, friends,
spins the yarns without end.

631
00:54:59,420 --> 00:55:01,700
Oh yes, I take it in my hands -

632
00:55:02,020 --> 00:55:03,940
Sandbanks are no problem.

633
00:55:04,740 --> 00:55:07,460
Let's overhaul the Sturgeon.

634
00:55:12,700 --> 00:55:16,180
- Left rudder!
- Don't teach me to hatch eggs.

635
00:55:16,820 --> 00:55:19,820
I know all sandbanks around here.
There's number one.

636
00:55:26,340 --> 00:55:27,700
Here's number two.

637
00:55:31,460 --> 00:55:33,300
Sixth day

638
00:55:41,100 --> 00:55:44,020
The river is wide,

639
00:55:45,940 --> 00:55:49,060
The river is blue,

640
00:55:50,980 --> 00:55:53,780
We are sailing along,

641
00:55:55,780 --> 00:55:58,900
Just me and you.

642
00:56:08,580 --> 00:56:11,940
The sky-high mountains,

643
00:56:12,860 --> 00:56:16,060
The fields under crops,

644
00:56:17,420 --> 00:56:20,460
The vast steppe expanses

645
00:56:22,100 --> 00:56:25,540
Of the land of my folks.

646
00:56:30,140 --> 00:56:33,620
We sail with ease,

647
00:56:34,820 --> 00:56:37,780
We sing with ease.

648
00:56:43,300 --> 00:56:45,860
Guys, welcome the truce envoys.

649
00:56:51,660 --> 00:56:53,060
Arrow...

650
00:57:01,620 --> 00:57:03,100
- Alyosha.
- Arrow.

651
00:57:03,180 --> 00:57:06,700
- I want to ask you something.
- I am glad you came.

652
00:57:06,980 --> 00:57:10,620
Remember the song I sang
for you on the ferry?

653
00:57:10,860 --> 00:57:12,740
Which song?

654
00:57:13,420 --> 00:57:16,460
Dunya wrote it,
our letter-carrier.

655
00:57:17,180 --> 00:57:18,820
No, I don't.

656
00:57:19,540 --> 00:57:21,860
You called her a fool.

657
00:57:22,140 --> 00:57:26,660
A fool? Now I remember.
What a fool I was.

658
00:57:26,940 --> 00:57:29,660
Right. How clever you are,
Alyosha.

659
00:57:30,420 --> 00:57:33,300
- Friends forever?
- Friends forever.

660
00:57:37,060 --> 00:57:39,540
Will you help me
with the notation.

661
00:57:39,900 --> 00:57:41,180
My pleasure.

662
00:57:42,660 --> 00:57:45,380
You are not going to present it
in Moscow, are you?

663
00:57:45,580 --> 00:57:47,500
- Yes, we are.
- You nuts or something?

664
00:57:47,740 --> 00:57:49,020
What's that for?

665
00:57:49,300 --> 00:57:52,620
You'll disgrace our region.
You'll flop for all I know.

666
00:57:53,380 --> 00:57:55,460
See that YOU don't flop.

667
00:57:55,820 --> 00:57:58,100
We'll see who's gonna flop.

668
00:57:58,340 --> 00:58:00,460
- I bet you'll flop.
- No, we won't.

669
00:58:00,780 --> 00:58:02,620
- You will.
- No, we won't.

670
00:58:02,780 --> 00:58:04,140
You will.

671
00:58:09,900 --> 00:58:12,300
Now which of us has flopped?

672
00:58:14,540 --> 00:58:18,460
How do you like it?
You'll flop indeed.

673
00:58:21,460 --> 00:58:22,820
Get her.

674
00:58:23,620 --> 00:58:25,820
She broke the boat.

675
00:58:26,980 --> 00:58:29,100
That's unprecedented hooliganism.

676
00:58:29,260 --> 00:58:31,700
She trampled on

677
00:58:32,340 --> 00:58:34,420
the newly repaired boat.

678
00:58:45,060 --> 00:58:46,820
That's ridiculous.

679
00:58:57,580 --> 00:58:59,780
I just want to fret and fume.

680
00:59:25,340 --> 00:59:28,860
Many a song has been sung
'bout the Volga.

681
00:59:32,820 --> 00:59:36,060
But the best one is yet
to be sung

682
00:59:40,260 --> 00:59:43,980
That would fly across
our Mother Volga

683
00:59:49,100 --> 00:59:52,740
In the bright rays
of our Soviet sun.

684
00:59:58,620 --> 01:00:01,740
Oh Volga, so beautiful,

685
01:00:04,260 --> 01:00:07,460
Like sea you're
full and plentiful...

686
01:00:11,780 --> 01:00:14,340
Why does he think
it's no good?

687
01:00:16,340 --> 01:00:19,140
So wide, so powerful.

688
01:00:23,180 --> 01:00:26,380
Sing a ringing
and cheerful song...

689
01:00:33,700 --> 01:00:37,500
Pride aside, if I take
a sober view of it...

690
01:00:49,140 --> 01:00:51,260
it's really bad.

691
01:00:53,340 --> 01:00:55,980
I shouldn't have hurt
his feelings.

692
01:01:44,460 --> 01:01:47,260
- Where can I find Arrow?
- Second door on the left.

693
01:01:48,020 --> 01:01:52,340
- Tugboat, ahoy!
- Tugboat, ay-ay!

694
01:01:52,740 --> 01:01:54,780
I need to talk to the cap.

695
01:01:54,980 --> 01:01:56,500
Come on, moor.

696
01:01:57,580 --> 01:02:00,260
I can't set your boat afloat,
citizen.

697
01:02:00,420 --> 01:02:02,460
I've just promised a cap.

698
01:02:02,700 --> 01:02:04,420
A cap?

699
01:02:05,460 --> 01:02:08,500
- There you are. I got you.
- It can happen to anybody.

700
01:02:09,180 --> 01:02:11,540
He's my pilot.
Let's go, comrades.

701
01:02:29,940 --> 01:02:31,860
Alyosha, can I come in?

702
01:02:32,260 --> 01:02:37,140
The concert will be broadcast
in two minutes

703
01:02:38,180 --> 01:02:40,780
without any special notice.

704
01:02:42,700 --> 01:02:43,980
Attention.

705
01:02:44,300 --> 01:02:46,060
Singer Tigrova

706
01:02:47,180 --> 01:02:49,660
will perform romance

707
01:02:50,580 --> 01:02:52,340
"Don't turn on the light"
by Arensky.

708
01:02:52,820 --> 01:02:56,100
I won't turn it on, it'll be
easier for me to speak this way.

709
01:02:59,620 --> 01:03:01,580
I told you a lie.

710
01:03:01,140 --> 01:03:03,060
I wrote this song.

711
01:03:04,620 --> 01:03:05,980
You have anybody?

712
01:03:25,100 --> 01:03:27,780
So we set your old boot
afloat, comrade chief.

713
01:03:28,060 --> 01:03:29,860
What about the sailer?

714
01:03:30,100 --> 01:03:34,540
- The sailer is not in my system.
- It is in the Soviet system.

715
01:03:35,340 --> 01:03:36,700
Later.

716
01:03:38,980 --> 01:03:40,580
Stop the boat!

717
01:03:41,380 --> 01:03:43,860
Stop the boat!

718
01:03:45,540 --> 01:03:48,380
Something must be wrong
with the steamer.

719
01:03:48,580 --> 01:03:52,460
What can be wrong with the steamer
if I am here?

720
01:03:53,260 --> 01:03:54,940
Full steam ahead.

721
01:03:55,860 --> 01:03:57,460
Fullest steam ahead!

722
01:04:00,100 --> 01:04:02,020
First day

723
01:04:06,780 --> 01:04:08,660
Second day

724
01:04:14,180 --> 01:04:16,020
Third day

725
01:04:17,420 --> 01:04:20,820
On the Greater Volga Olympiad
teams changed for Moscow boats.

726
01:04:21,300 --> 01:04:25,380
- Thanks for giving us a lift.
- Take care.

727
01:05:21,180 --> 01:05:24,380
We have moved many a mount
and river,

728
01:05:26,500 --> 01:05:30,020
Our dreams are all a-coming true.

729
01:05:32,300 --> 01:05:35,900
And the Volga now free forever,

730
01:05:39,700 --> 01:05:42,900
Carries ships to our Moscow.

731
01:06:04,820 --> 01:06:08,820
Alyosha's band was also
rehearsing a new tune.

732
01:06:14,380 --> 01:06:17,700
Sing a ringing and cheerful song

733
01:06:19,620 --> 01:06:22,940
That would show how strong we are.

734
01:06:24,980 --> 01:06:28,580
May it reach the bright golden sun,

735
01:06:31,940 --> 01:06:35,500
May it reach every person's heart.

736
01:06:50,140 --> 01:06:53,660
Like my land,

737
01:06:56,300 --> 01:06:58,340
so free

738
01:07:03,380 --> 01:07:05,380
and vast

739
01:07:13,260 --> 01:07:15,460
and strong.

740
01:07:21,380 --> 01:07:22,780
Great.

741
01:07:23,060 --> 01:07:24,940
So you say the letter-carrier
wrote it?

742
01:07:26,580 --> 01:07:27,900
Great.

743
01:07:28,340 --> 01:07:31,500
We should arrange this song,
we'll sing it in Moscow.

744
01:07:32,180 --> 01:07:33,580
Hear, hear.

745
01:07:34,220 --> 01:07:37,300
There is not any music
paper on the boat.

746
01:07:37,700 --> 01:07:40,340
Comrade Byvalov has paper galore.

747
01:07:40,740 --> 01:07:42,220
We can line it.

748
01:07:42,980 --> 01:07:44,900
Ivan Ivanovich Byvalov

749
01:07:45,620 --> 01:07:47,500
Here we are.

750
01:07:51,660 --> 01:07:53,940
Arrow, you start.

751
01:07:57,140 --> 01:08:00,980
Many a song has been sung
'bout the Volga.

752
01:08:04,940 --> 01:08:08,260
But the best one has yet
to be sung

753
01:08:11,540 --> 01:08:14,940
That would fly across
our Mother Volga

754
01:08:17,820 --> 01:08:21,020
In the bright rays
of our Soviet sun.

755
01:08:53,860 --> 01:08:56,500
Comrades!
Don't panic.

756
01:08:58,380 --> 01:09:00,100
There is no panic around here.

757
01:09:00,740 --> 01:09:04,100
There's a storm outside
and they say no panic.

758
01:09:04,580 --> 01:09:07,740
Nonsense. It's the river,
not the ocean.

759
01:09:08,940 --> 01:09:12,180
What do you know.
Rivers are worse than oceans.

760
01:09:13,100 --> 01:09:16,220
I've sailed for 30 years,
I know of heaps of stories.

761
01:09:17,420 --> 01:09:19,460
You know about wet logs?

762
01:09:19,900 --> 01:09:22,060
Wet logs?

763
01:09:22,220 --> 01:09:25,460
So you don't. You see
a log is floating.

764
01:09:26,300 --> 01:09:29,580
One half in the water,
the other on the surface.

765
01:09:30,460 --> 01:09:32,620
An inexperienced pilot
in the dark

766
01:09:32,820 --> 01:09:36,700
will run into it and damage
the bilge.

767
01:09:38,140 --> 01:09:41,180
Or the log - bang! -

768
01:09:42,340 --> 01:09:44,220
pierces the boat

769
01:09:44,340 --> 01:09:46,980
so some of it sticks out
in the saloon.

770
01:09:47,340 --> 01:09:49,460
You lie like a gas meter.

771
01:09:49,700 --> 01:09:52,380
May I not sit here if I lie.

772
01:09:55,020 --> 01:09:56,780
What did I say?

773
01:09:57,340 --> 01:09:58,900
Stand from under!

774
01:10:02,140 --> 01:10:04,180
Save who can!

775
01:10:06,500 --> 01:10:08,140
And who can't?

776
01:11:08,820 --> 01:11:10,740
The song is lost.

777
01:11:27,180 --> 01:11:30,700
Sunday

778
01:12:35,500 --> 01:12:38,380
Oh Volga so beautiful,

779
01:12:39,740 --> 01:12:42,740
Like sea you're full
and plentiful,

780
01:12:43,700 --> 01:12:46,380
Like my land free
and bountiful,

781
01:12:47,620 --> 01:12:50,500
So wide, so powerful.

782
01:12:51,580 --> 01:12:52,900
That's better.

783
01:12:53,100 --> 01:12:57,060
Let's pool our resources.
Your choir will sing it

784
01:12:57,220 --> 01:12:59,620
with our symphony orchestra.

785
01:13:00,660 --> 01:13:02,900
- Is it worth it?
- It's a good song.

786
01:13:03,380 --> 01:13:04,940
It's a wonderful song.

787
01:13:05,140 --> 01:13:07,500
Nobody knows it but we do.

788
01:13:08,580 --> 01:13:11,100
Why don't we sing it
at the Olympiad?

789
01:13:12,500 --> 01:13:15,540
We don't sing it right.
I wish Arrow were here.

790
01:13:16,300 --> 01:13:18,260
She sing. It so well.

791
01:13:19,900 --> 01:13:21,380
It's the Sturgeon.

792
01:13:22,580 --> 01:13:24,940
Moscow sea

793
01:13:33,820 --> 01:13:36,220
Arrow, I am over here.

794
01:13:47,700 --> 01:13:50,540
Forgive me, I acted
like a silly kid.

795
01:13:50,740 --> 01:13:52,900
Your Dunya is a real talent

796
01:13:53,060 --> 01:13:55,540
and her song is wonderful.

797
01:13:58,060 --> 01:13:59,980
You are laying is thick.

798
01:14:00,460 --> 01:14:03,060
Not at all. You know nothing
about music.

799
01:14:03,260 --> 01:14:05,820
I hope you didn't tell her
that I called her a fool?

800
01:14:05,980 --> 01:14:08,860
Don't hope, she heard it.

801
01:14:09,500 --> 01:14:11,820
I'll apologize to her
when I come back home.

802
01:14:12,020 --> 01:14:14,980
You don't have to, she's here.

803
01:14:15,420 --> 01:14:16,700
Here?

804
01:14:17,700 --> 01:14:19,180
Where is she?

805
01:14:19,420 --> 01:14:21,700
You are going to see her.

806
01:14:22,580 --> 01:14:24,140
I can't wait.

807
01:14:56,660 --> 01:14:59,580
Comrade Trubyshkin,
report the situation.

808
01:15:00,740 --> 01:15:02,700
You can congratulate us.

809
01:15:02,820 --> 01:15:05,820
We have a terrific number,
The Song of the Volga.

810
01:15:06,100 --> 01:15:08,540
Arrow is going to bring
the composer.

811
01:15:08,740 --> 01:15:10,580
Right. Schulbert?

812
01:15:11,860 --> 01:15:14,180
No, not Schubert, Dunya.

813
01:15:14,500 --> 01:15:16,580
She's the song writer
and Arrow's friend.

814
01:15:21,740 --> 01:15:24,820
- I don't see Dunya here.
- Open your eyes.

815
01:15:25,340 --> 01:15:26,700
Where is she?

816
01:15:27,780 --> 01:15:29,220
Right here.

817
01:15:43,260 --> 01:15:46,020
Let our enemies,
like hungry wild coyotes,

818
01:15:46,820 --> 01:15:49,660
Prowl daily 'bout our frontier,

819
01:15:50,580 --> 01:15:53,340
They will never
get to the Volga,

820
01:15:54,020 --> 01:15:56,620
Nor drink water
from that river.

821
01:15:57,940 --> 01:16:00,540
Gorblimey. How come they know it?

822
01:16:00,860 --> 01:16:03,740
Oh Volga, so beautiful,

823
01:16:04,460 --> 01:16:07,340
Like sea so full
and plentiful,

824
01:16:08,780 --> 01:16:11,540
Like my land free
and bountiful,

825
01:16:13,060 --> 01:16:15,860
So wide, so powerful.

826
01:16:17,780 --> 01:16:20,260
- It's our song.
- What do you know?

827
01:17:27,700 --> 01:17:31,020
Can you believe it?
Our song is known everywhere.

828
01:17:38,660 --> 01:17:40,980
So the music was stolen.

829
01:17:41,220 --> 01:17:43,820
Here's composer Dunya for you.

830
01:17:44,660 --> 01:17:47,860
Comrades, I swear it's her song.

831
01:17:49,380 --> 01:17:52,260
- Let me explain.
- What is there to explain?

832
01:17:52,380 --> 01:17:54,060
We put aside everything

833
01:17:54,900 --> 01:17:56,900
and rehearse this song.

834
01:17:57,100 --> 01:17:59,020
What are we going to show now?

835
01:18:11,060 --> 01:18:12,500
Moscow!

836
01:18:17,380 --> 01:18:18,780
It's curtains for me.

837
01:18:20,420 --> 01:18:22,460
This is comrade Byvalov.

838
01:18:25,220 --> 01:18:27,060
I am a reporter.

839
01:18:27,300 --> 01:18:29,460
I'd like to ask you
a few questions.

840
01:18:30,100 --> 01:18:33,260
Wait a minute. Comrade Byvalov,
they want to see you

841
01:18:33,500 --> 01:18:35,420
at the Olympiad headquarters.

842
01:18:35,780 --> 01:18:37,060
Let's go.

843
01:18:42,860 --> 01:18:45,020
What did I say?

844
01:18:48,300 --> 01:18:50,340
Greetings, comrades.

845
01:18:52,140 --> 01:18:53,900
Your Dunya--

846
01:18:54,100 --> 01:18:56,660
Don't say it.
You don't know her.

847
01:18:56,940 --> 01:18:58,940
It's her luck that I don't.

848
01:18:59,100 --> 01:19:02,340
She didn't steal the song.
It was stolen from her.

849
01:19:27,060 --> 01:19:30,140
Comrades, you see before you
the Byvalov--

850
01:19:30,700 --> 01:19:32,580
We know.

851
01:19:32,820 --> 01:19:34,820
Greetings, comrades.

852
01:19:35,020 --> 01:19:36,540
Tell us what you do.

853
01:19:39,860 --> 01:19:42,500
We make balalaikas, comrades.

854
01:19:44,020 --> 01:19:47,580
Some may think
it's nothing special.

855
01:19:48,900 --> 01:19:50,940
But I must tell you

856
01:19:51,260 --> 01:19:53,700
that given expert hands,

857
01:19:54,020 --> 01:19:56,300
this can be exciting.

858
01:19:57,860 --> 01:19:59,780
I am not boasting

859
01:20:00,420 --> 01:20:02,620
but having mastered
music culture

860
01:20:04,300 --> 01:20:06,300
and knowing Schulbert
personally--

861
01:20:07,140 --> 01:20:09,260
- Pardon?
- To the piano please.

862
01:20:11,020 --> 01:20:12,460
To the piano.

863
01:20:14,740 --> 01:20:16,300
Come on, come on.

864
01:20:19,980 --> 01:20:22,180
It's a mistake, comrades.

865
01:20:22,540 --> 01:20:25,100
My system doesn't make pianos.

866
01:20:25,460 --> 01:20:26,900
Go, go.

867
01:20:27,660 --> 01:20:30,300
Attention please.
Comrade Byvalov will perform

868
01:20:30,660 --> 01:20:32,500
his famous song.

869
01:20:36,380 --> 01:20:38,740
- I can't sing.
- Okay, play.

870
01:20:39,620 --> 01:20:42,140
- I can't play.
- Are you a poet or composer?

871
01:20:42,620 --> 01:20:45,580
I am neither, comrades,
believe me.

872
01:20:46,260 --> 01:20:47,620
Citizen...

873
01:20:47,860 --> 01:20:49,940
Is this your name?

874
01:20:50,020 --> 01:20:52,740
- Yes. The paper's mine too.
- And the notation?

875
01:20:53,100 --> 01:20:55,260
Notation? Oh yes, notation.

876
01:20:58,500 --> 01:21:00,020
I can't make head
or tail of it.

877
01:21:01,220 --> 01:21:04,020
- Do you know this song?
- Which one?

878
01:21:04,860 --> 01:21:06,620
This one.

879
01:22:17,220 --> 01:22:20,020
So many talented guys!

880
01:22:27,820 --> 01:22:30,740
So this song was written
on your paper.

881
01:22:31,140 --> 01:22:32,500
Who wrote it?

882
01:22:32,620 --> 01:22:34,260
- My--
- Yours?

883
01:22:34,460 --> 01:22:37,300
Dunya in my system
from Shallow Water.

884
01:22:37,580 --> 01:22:39,740
She must come here.

885
01:22:39,820 --> 01:22:41,820
Dunya.. And her last name?

886
01:22:42,260 --> 01:22:43,940
Last name?

887
01:22:44,260 --> 01:22:45,660
Oh, her last name.

888
01:22:47,140 --> 01:22:49,220
Let me write it down.

889
01:22:57,180 --> 01:22:59,420
Find Dunya

890
01:23:00,220 --> 01:23:04,580
from Shallow Water and send her
to the Olympiad HQ.

891
01:23:05,580 --> 01:23:07,180
Ivan Byvalov.

892
01:23:07,940 --> 01:23:10,820
- Dunya?
- Make haste. They're waiting.

893
01:23:11,180 --> 01:23:13,420
Guys, go find Dunya.

894
01:23:41,300 --> 01:23:43,100
- So you are Dunya?
- Right.

895
01:23:43,700 --> 01:23:45,700
- It's the Dunya.
- Come over here now.

896
01:23:46,100 --> 01:23:47,820
I act with a partner.

897
01:23:48,100 --> 01:23:49,420
Move it.

898
01:23:49,780 --> 01:23:52,540
- I'll help you.
- You know my tricks?

899
01:23:52,820 --> 01:23:54,860
What tricks?

900
01:23:55,500 --> 01:23:57,900
Hands of gold! Go.

901
01:24:05,460 --> 01:24:07,580
We would like you

902
01:24:07,780 --> 01:24:10,220
to sing your song.

903
01:24:10,740 --> 01:24:12,060
I beg your pardon?

904
01:24:14,380 --> 01:24:15,820
We've got her.

905
01:24:16,180 --> 01:24:18,300
- Everything's fine.
- Get her here.

906
01:24:20,620 --> 01:24:24,100
A sad mistake, comrades.

907
01:24:25,540 --> 01:24:27,580
It's not the Dunya.

908
01:24:28,060 --> 01:24:30,900
But now you'll see
the real one.

909
01:25:00,460 --> 01:25:02,020
What's that?

910
01:25:02,580 --> 01:25:04,540
- Who is she?
- Who are you?

911
01:25:04,900 --> 01:25:06,260
Me? I'm Dunya.

912
01:25:06,620 --> 01:25:08,580
- Who?
- Dunya.

913
01:25:11,140 --> 01:25:13,380
It's a coincidence.

914
01:25:15,180 --> 01:25:18,220
Tell me what's this supposed
to mean.

915
01:25:18,820 --> 01:25:22,340
They are all called Dunya.
I brought them all.

916
01:25:23,780 --> 01:25:25,740
Comrades Dunyas,

917
01:25:26,140 --> 01:25:28,420
tell me frankly

918
01:25:28,700 --> 01:25:31,500
which of you wrote this song.

919
01:25:32,100 --> 01:25:34,580
Just own it, girls.
You'll get away with it.

920
01:25:34,900 --> 01:25:36,420
They'll never own it.

921
01:25:36,820 --> 01:25:41,300
They are from Shallow Water,
they'll never own it.

922
01:25:41,860 --> 01:25:44,700
Send for Arrow.
She would know.

923
01:25:45,140 --> 01:25:47,220
- Arrow?
- What did I say?

924
01:25:47,580 --> 01:25:50,460
Why didn't you tell me earlier?
Let's go find Arrow.

925
01:25:56,620 --> 01:25:58,500
I need to go to the HQ.
Give me a boat.

926
01:25:58,900 --> 01:26:00,500
No boats at the moment.

927
01:26:00,980 --> 01:26:04,300
If you don't give me a boat,
I'll swim to the HQ.

928
01:26:04,820 --> 01:26:06,340
Arrow!

929
01:26:06,380 --> 01:26:08,220
- Where's Arrow?
- What happened?

930
01:26:08,460 --> 01:26:12,780
An emergency. It's about the song.
HQ want Arrow, now.

931
01:26:28,620 --> 01:26:30,700
Hey, come back!

932
01:26:32,700 --> 01:26:34,020
Hold on.

933
01:26:50,940 --> 01:26:53,180
Stop it. Let go of me.

934
01:26:58,500 --> 01:27:00,100
What have I done?

935
01:27:00,340 --> 01:27:02,500
- What is your name?
- Dunya Petrova..

936
01:27:02,620 --> 01:27:04,740
Who are wrecking a world record.

937
01:27:04,900 --> 01:27:06,860
I am swimming from Moscow
to Baku nonstop

938
01:27:07,020 --> 01:27:09,740
and you've pulled me out
of the water. For shame.

939
01:27:15,460 --> 01:27:17,860
It's ridiculous.

940
01:27:19,620 --> 01:27:21,700
Wait, Arrow, wait.

941
01:27:23,140 --> 01:27:24,620
Arrow!

942
01:27:25,820 --> 01:27:27,140
Wait!

943
01:27:27,940 --> 01:27:30,460
It's urgent. You are wanted
in the HQ.

944
01:27:30,660 --> 01:27:32,780
- What for?
- You should identify the girl.

945
01:27:32,980 --> 01:27:35,180
- What girl?
- The one who stole the song.

946
01:27:35,380 --> 01:27:37,260
What song?

947
01:27:39,060 --> 01:27:41,340
Oh Volga, so beautiful...

948
01:27:42,380 --> 01:27:44,340
Tell me straight:
who is this Dunya?

949
01:27:45,260 --> 01:27:46,620
It's me.

950
01:27:47,860 --> 01:27:49,140
You?

951
01:27:52,020 --> 01:27:54,380
Are you all right?

952
01:27:54,620 --> 01:27:56,020
I am all right.

953
01:28:06,140 --> 01:28:07,820
You shouldn't say it's you.

954
01:28:08,100 --> 01:28:09,980
- Yes I will.
- I won't let you.

955
01:28:10,180 --> 01:28:12,540
I am going. That's none
of your business.

956
01:28:12,740 --> 01:28:14,460
You fool, I love you.

957
01:28:16,100 --> 01:28:17,980
Are you all right?

958
01:28:18,380 --> 01:28:19,980
I am not.

959
01:28:20,700 --> 01:28:22,100
Water!

960
01:29:34,980 --> 01:29:37,220
Comrades, this citizen

961
01:29:37,660 --> 01:29:40,780
will name the Dunya
who wrote the song.

962
01:29:41,700 --> 01:29:43,140
Don't tell them.

963
01:29:43,540 --> 01:29:44,900
Hey, Dunyas.

964
01:29:53,180 --> 01:29:54,660
Comrades,

965
01:29:55,260 --> 01:29:57,460
do what you will,

966
01:29:58,540 --> 01:30:01,580
but it's me who wrote
this song.

967
01:30:07,940 --> 01:30:11,060
Many a song has been sung
'bout the Volga.

968
01:30:13,460 --> 01:30:16,900
All were mirthless
in the minor key.

969
01:30:19,660 --> 01:30:23,140
It was anguish that spawned
those melodies,

970
01:30:27,380 --> 01:30:30,500
Now it's joy and happiness
and glee.

971
01:30:34,580 --> 01:30:38,060
Sing a ringing
and cheerful song

972
01:30:41,100 --> 01:30:44,380
That would show
how strong we are.

973
01:30:46,780 --> 01:30:49,780
May it reach our golden
bright sun,

974
01:30:55,340 --> 01:30:58,340
May it reach every
person's heart.

975
01:31:01,700 --> 01:31:03,620
Listen, Arrow.

976
01:31:10,340 --> 01:31:11,780
What's that?

977
01:31:12,060 --> 01:31:14,940
It's your theme
and my arrangement.

978
01:31:38,740 --> 01:31:41,140
- Give back my striped vest.
- Let go.

979
01:31:41,500 --> 01:31:43,540
I can't go around like this.

980
01:32:08,140 --> 01:32:09,420
Comrades!

981
01:32:09,740 --> 01:32:12,500
This is the Dunya

982
01:32:12,780 --> 01:32:15,100
we've been looking for.

983
01:32:15,780 --> 01:32:18,300
She wrote this song.

984
01:32:19,460 --> 01:32:21,140
She by right

985
01:32:24,940 --> 01:32:27,100
deserves the first--

986
01:32:32,900 --> 01:32:34,220
What's going on?

987
01:33:00,020 --> 01:33:02,580
The jury calls out
Dunya Petrova,

988
01:33:03,020 --> 01:33:04,820
author of the song
of the Volga.

989
01:33:05,420 --> 01:33:07,780
The jury calls out
Dunya Petrova!

990
01:33:08,460 --> 01:33:10,220
Dunya Petrova!

991
01:33:14,660 --> 01:33:18,140
I'll never argue with you
anymore.

992
01:33:20,540 --> 01:33:22,140
- Friends?
- Friends.

993
01:33:22,340 --> 01:33:24,260
- Forever?
- Forever.

994
01:33:26,180 --> 01:33:28,780
Oh how I love you, Alyosha!

995
01:33:30,020 --> 01:33:31,860
But that's beyond
your comprehension.

996
01:33:33,340 --> 01:33:34,900
- Beyond?
- Yes, yes.

997
01:33:35,620 --> 01:33:37,660
Look, you are so obstinate.

998
01:33:39,300 --> 01:33:41,820
- Nowhere.
- Not even on the motor boat.

999
01:33:43,180 --> 01:33:44,860
- Found?
- No.

1000
01:33:45,060 --> 01:33:48,260
We can't wait any longer.
Can't you sing without her?

1001
01:33:48,620 --> 01:33:51,340
- We might but...
- Okay, come onto the stage.

1002
01:33:52,060 --> 01:33:54,740
Okhapkin, Philipp, Nina, go.

1003
01:33:56,780 --> 01:33:58,700
Come on, guys. Go, go.

1004
01:34:01,220 --> 01:34:05,300
Comrades, you will now hear
the Song of the Volga.

1005
01:34:05,820 --> 01:34:07,860
- Author!
- Where's the author?

1006
01:34:09,060 --> 01:34:11,020
Quiet, comrades.

1007
01:34:11,660 --> 01:34:14,020
If there's a song,
there's an author.

1008
01:34:15,580 --> 01:34:18,820
We dispersed every dark
thundercloud,

1009
01:34:19,820 --> 01:34:23,260
Spring has come to our
dear Motherland,

1010
01:34:23,940 --> 01:34:27,020
Like the Volga,
our life is full-blooded,

1011
01:34:27,900 --> 01:34:31,260
And this free life will not
ever end.

1012
01:34:32,300 --> 01:34:34,620
O Volga, so beautiful,

1013
01:34:40,260 --> 01:34:42,900
Like sea, you're full
and plentiful...

1014
01:34:46,020 --> 01:34:48,620
It's my throat again, Kuzma.

1015
01:34:49,020 --> 01:34:51,020
Own it, comrade Byvalov.

1016
01:34:51,180 --> 01:34:54,820
You have to study 20 years
to sing well.

1017
01:34:55,580 --> 01:34:57,300
You don't say.

1018
01:34:57,620 --> 01:35:00,140
I say... clear the deck.

1019
01:35:01,620 --> 01:35:04,220
You think I don't love you
as much as you love me?

1020
01:35:03,300 --> 01:35:05,060
Yes, I do.

1021
01:35:05,260 --> 01:35:07,260
- I love you more.
- I love you more.

1022
01:35:14,340 --> 01:35:16,100
You are mine.

1023
01:35:16,380 --> 01:35:18,220
You are another.

1024
01:35:23,020 --> 01:35:24,380
- Is that it?
- Yes.

1025
01:35:32,820 --> 01:35:34,860
- Is that it?
- Yes.

1026
01:35:35,340 --> 01:35:36,620
Arrow!

1027
01:35:38,980 --> 01:35:40,900
Hey, they caught the author.

1028
01:35:42,620 --> 01:35:44,060
Just about time.

1029
01:35:46,580 --> 01:35:48,660
Is our time up?

1030
01:35:49,220 --> 01:35:51,860
- No.
- Oh no.

1031
01:35:56,060 --> 01:35:59,220
Do not rush out of the theater,

1032
01:36:01,340 --> 01:36:03,260
We would like to keep you here

1033
01:36:03,820 --> 01:36:06,180
For another couple minutes

1034
01:36:06,380 --> 01:36:08,700
To strike balances, Oh yes.

1035
01:36:19,700 --> 01:36:22,420
We tried real hard,

1036
01:36:24,820 --> 01:36:27,060
We are glad you laughed,

1037
01:36:32,740 --> 01:36:36,580
For laughter can heal,
And laughter can kill.

1038
01:36:37,700 --> 01:36:41,820
This is not to say red tapists
Can be found at every turn.

1039
01:36:42,860 --> 01:36:46,820
When you see those opportunists,
Like Byvalov they are all.

1040
01:36:47,660 --> 01:36:51,540
Very oft petty thoughts and actions,
Aftermath of the cursed time,

1041
01:36:52,500 --> 01:36:56,460
Do obstruct our work and creations,
Bloom of talent in our clime.

1042
01:36:57,540 --> 01:37:00,340
We must clear all the rubbish,

1043
01:37:02,220 --> 01:37:05,340
Sweep it off with our hands

1044
01:37:10,220 --> 01:37:14,260
And wide as the Volga
along the road

1045
01:37:15,100 --> 01:37:18,260
March from strength to strength.

1046
01:37:19,220 --> 01:37:22,340
O Volga, so beautiful,

1047
01:37:24,140 --> 01:37:27,140
Like sea, you're full
and plentiful,

1048
01:37:28,620 --> 01:37:31,580
Like my land free
and bountiful,

1049
01:37:32,940 --> 01:37:35,620
So wide, deep and powerful.

1050
01:37:48,180 --> 01:37:50,060
