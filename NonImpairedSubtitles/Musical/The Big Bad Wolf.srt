1
00:01:12,631 --> 00:01:14,997
Good morning,
Little Red Riding Hood.

2
00:01:15,033 --> 00:01:17,501
Good morning.
How do you do?

3
00:01:17,535 --> 00:01:20,299
Good morning,
Miss Riding Hood.

4
00:01:24,042 --> 00:01:26,442
Where are you going,
Red Riding Hood?

5
00:01:26,478 --> 00:01:28,503
What's in the basket?
Something good?

6
00:01:28,546 --> 00:01:31,640
I'm bringing Grandma
cakes and wine.

7
00:01:31,683 --> 00:01:33,742
She's awful, awful sick.

8
00:01:33,785 --> 00:01:35,776
I'm in a great big hurry, too.

9
00:01:35,820 --> 00:01:37,754
I gotta get there quick.

10
00:01:37,789 --> 00:01:40,724
You'll get there quick,
red Riding Hood...

11
00:01:40,759 --> 00:01:43,023
if you take the shortcut
through the wood.

12
00:01:44,696 --> 00:01:46,459
There's danger in them woods.

13
00:01:46,498 --> 00:01:47,829
Beware!

14
00:01:47,866 --> 00:01:50,528
The Big Bad Wolf
is lurking there.

15
00:01:52,604 --> 00:01:54,834
Better to be safe than sorry.

16
00:01:54,873 --> 00:01:57,205
Shortcuts are not always good.

17
00:01:57,242 --> 00:01:59,574
Take the long road
'round the forest...

18
00:01:59,611 --> 00:02:02,273
while the wolf
is in the wood.

19
00:02:06,551 --> 00:02:08,519
That old wolf
is just a sissy.

20
00:02:08,553 --> 00:02:10,521
All he does is huff...

21
00:02:10,555 --> 00:02:11,749
and puff.

22
00:02:11,790 --> 00:02:14,088
We'll go with you
and protect you.

23
00:02:14,125 --> 00:02:17,288
Come along,
we'll call his bluff.

24
00:02:18,697 --> 00:02:20,426
<i>Who's afraid
of the Big Bad Wolf</i>

25
00:02:20,465 --> 00:02:22,433
<i>Big Bad Wolf,
Big Bad Wolf?</i>

26
00:02:22,467 --> 00:02:24,264
<i>Who's afraid
of the Big Bad Wolf</i>

27
00:03:02,540 --> 00:03:04,235
Ha ha ha ha ha ha!

28
00:03:21,359 --> 00:03:23,259
Heh heh heh heh heh.

29
00:03:23,294 --> 00:03:24,625
I'll get 'em.

30
00:03:34,806 --> 00:03:37,536
<i>I'm Goldilocks,
the fairy queen</i>

31
00:03:37,575 --> 00:03:39,440
<i>Spirit of the woods am I</i>

32
00:03:39,477 --> 00:03:40,444
Whoops!

33
00:03:44,749 --> 00:03:46,910
<i>You'll flit and fly
from tree to tree</i>

34
00:03:46,951 --> 00:03:49,385
<i>Come, come, my dears,
you're safe with me</i>

35
00:03:49,421 --> 00:03:50,979
Whoops!

36
00:04:01,766 --> 00:04:03,097
Ooh!

37
00:04:07,172 --> 00:04:08,400

Unh! Unh! Unh!

Curses!

41
00:05:00,091 --> 00:05:02,082
Ha ha ha ha!

42
00:05:10,568 --> 00:05:11,933
Come in!

00:05:13,238 --> 00:05:15,900
Rah ha ha ha!

44
00:05:15,940 --> 00:05:17,339
Aah!

45
00:05:18,643 --> 00:05:20,110
Aah!

46
00:05:50,475 --> 00:05:52,966
Come in.

47
00:06:00,618 --> 00:06:03,985
Good morning, Grandma.
How do you feel today?

48
00:06:04,022 --> 00:06:06,513
Terrible.

49
