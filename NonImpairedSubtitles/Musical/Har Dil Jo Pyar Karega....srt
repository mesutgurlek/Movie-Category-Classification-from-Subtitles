1
00:01:25,618 --> 00:01:26,778
Hi! I'm Raj!

2
00:01:26,986 --> 00:01:31,787
People have always called me a kid.

3
00:01:32,125 --> 00:01:34,787
That was to suggest that I was an orphan.

4
00:01:35,228 --> 00:01:39,187
It was then Mrs. Godinho came into
my life and gave me her love.

5
00:01:39,332 --> 00:01:42,199
That was a signal that I was
no longer all alone in the world.

6
00:01:43,837 --> 00:01:45,805
She taught me something very nice.

7
00:01:46,339 --> 00:01:51,971
Do so much good to others
that they never lack goodness.

8
00:01:52,846 --> 00:01:54,814
It was Mrs. Godinho
who taught me music...

9
00:01:55,148 --> 00:01:57,810
and she wanted me to become
a very big singer some day.

10
00:01:58,151 --> 00:02:01,814
When I grew up, I started
dreaming of someone.

11
00:02:02,021 --> 00:02:03,488
My dream-girl

12
00:02:03,857 --> 00:02:07,816
this was a signal that there was
someone, who was made only for me

13
00:02:09,129 --> 00:02:12,223
I can't explain why, but I think
Mumbai is the city...

14
00:02:12,866 --> 00:02:16,825
where a career and
my dream-girl await me.

15
00:02:18,271 --> 00:02:20,271
You must wonder what `signals'
I'm talking about.

16
00:02:20,373 --> 00:02:23,240
According to Mrs. Godinho, God always
gives us the right signals.

17
00:02:23,877 --> 00:02:25,845
And it is we who can't see them

18
00:02:26,179 --> 00:02:28,238
I've always been fond
of body-building.

19
00:02:28,381 --> 00:02:30,661
Which is why I've kept away
from cigarettes and alcohol.

20
00:02:30,662 --> 00:02:33,841
If there is something I ever drink,
it's a cup of hot tea.

21
00:02:54,774 --> 00:02:56,867
A cup of hot tea!

22
00:02:59,646 --> 00:03:01,876
And my beloved to make me drink it up.

23
00:03:04,651 --> 00:03:07,279
May she be dark of skin, or fair.

24
00:03:09,589 --> 00:03:11,887
But someone who will embrace me

25
00:03:14,928 --> 00:03:19,297
I wish I could meet her;
And every sorrow would vanish.

26
00:04:13,519 --> 00:04:17,353
When I leave home every morning,
after giving her a kiss.

27
00:04:18,124 --> 00:04:22,356
And every moment I spend then missing her.

28
00:04:38,411 --> 00:04:42,370
For her, I will live and die.

29
00:04:43,516 --> 00:04:47,384
What else have I to do?

30
00:04:53,526 --> 00:04:55,994
There will be happiness for me.

31
00:04:58,531 --> 00:05:00,999
But nothing will have meaning without her.

32
00:05:03,770 --> 00:05:06,170
May she be fair of skin, or even dark.

33
00:05:08,775 --> 00:05:11,403
But she will embrace me.

34
00:05:14,047 --> 00:05:18,416
Every sorrow would vanish,
if only I could have her.

35
00:05:54,821 --> 00:05:59,053
She'll open the door for me,
when I return every evening.

36
00:05:59,625 --> 00:06:04,062
She'll hug me tightly and say she loves me.

37
00:06:04,597 --> 00:06:08,465
She come to me all dressed up.

38
00:06:09,736 --> 00:06:13,467
And relieve me of the stress of the day.

39
00:06:20,246 --> 00:06:22,476
She'll be different from the others.

40
00:06:25,118 --> 00:06:27,086
She'll be my wife.

41
00:06:55,648 --> 00:06:57,513
A cup of hot tea.

42
00:07:00,653 --> 00:07:02,518
And my beloved to make me drink it.

43
00:07:05,158 --> 00:07:08,127
May she be fair-skinned
or dark.

44
00:07:10,163 --> 00:07:12,529
But someone who will care for me.

45
00:07:15,768 --> 00:07:19,534
All my worries would vanish,
if only I could have her.

46
00:07:54,207 --> 00:07:57,176
There it is!
The signal to go to Mumbai!

47
00:08:16,496 --> 00:08:19,192
Raja!
- Aba!

48
00:08:19,599 --> 00:08:20,930
Hurry up, buddy!

49
00:08:24,237 --> 00:08:26,603
How are you?
- Delighted!

50
00:08:27,240 --> 00:08:30,209
At last! You've got the green signal
to come to Mumbai!

51
00:08:30,343 --> 00:08:32,208
Know what Mrs. Godinho says?

52
00:08:32,411 --> 00:08:35,608
In Mumbai, you will make
your life and find it too.

53
00:08:36,249 --> 00:08:40,208
Watch out! You're going to be
a superstar in a few days!

54
00:08:40,419 --> 00:08:42,216
You'll find your dream-girl too!

55
00:08:43,256 --> 00:08:46,623
So how's your uncle?
- Don't mention that name.

56
00:08:46,759 --> 00:08:48,624
Why not?
- The bloody miser!

57
00:08:49,262 --> 00:08:53,631
God had rather made me an orphan,
than give me an uncle like him!

58
00:08:53,766 --> 00:08:55,631
I thought I'd put up
with you and your uncle.

59
00:08:55,768 --> 00:08:58,635
He doesn't let me live with him.
Why would he allow you?

60
00:08:59,272 --> 00:09:00,637
Really?
- Of course.

61
00:09:00,773 --> 00:09:02,973
So what do you do for a living?
And where do you stay?

62
00:09:02,974 --> 00:09:05,243
I work at my uncle's
fruit-juice shop, all right!

63
00:09:05,778 --> 00:09:07,643
But I live in my own house.
- What?

64
00:09:07,780 --> 00:09:09,645
Oh yes!
- Your own house?

65
00:09:09,782 --> 00:09:12,250
A house in Mumbai!

66
00:09:16,756 --> 00:09:19,436
Do you like it? Great, isn't it?
- What place is this, by the way?

67
00:09:20,793 --> 00:09:23,660
Now look; I have nothing
that God has given me.

68
00:09:24,297 --> 00:09:27,664
Whatever I have is what I got
from the Municipality!

69
00:09:27,800 --> 00:09:29,665
It's a gift from the city of Mumbai!

70
00:09:29,802 --> 00:09:33,670
Priceless stuff, I must say.
- All stolen. Real hard work, I say.

71
00:09:33,806 --> 00:09:36,673
And what do you call the place?
- My home.

72
00:09:36,809 --> 00:09:40,267
It's better than living on the pavements!

73
00:09:41,614 --> 00:09:45,675
If it wasn't for the roof and the
walls, it's worse than the pavements!

74
00:09:46,819 --> 00:09:49,686
You can't think of bathing
without water, can you?

75
00:09:49,956 --> 00:09:52,288
So you mustn't call your house names.

76
00:09:52,491 --> 00:09:56,689
Life is difficult in this city.
You'll get to know very soon.

77
00:09:57,330 --> 00:09:59,298
That I know.

78
00:10:00,833 --> 00:10:02,713
This is the city where
I will find everything.

79
00:10:06,839 --> 00:10:09,706
Now tell me; what should be
my first step in the city?

80
00:10:10,343 --> 00:10:13,710
Simple. You must buy a bike.
- What has that to do with singing?

81
00:10:13,846 --> 00:10:15,711
This is a city of pretenses.

82
00:10:15,848 --> 00:10:17,808
Those with vehicles
take off before anyone else.

83
00:10:18,851 --> 00:10:21,319
We'd need money for that.
- Sure, we would.

84
00:10:21,520 --> 00:10:23,715
Let me open the Reserve Bank's locker.
- Hurry up.

85
00:10:23,856 --> 00:10:27,724
Here you are! Count it!
- Not me. Do it yourself.

86
00:10:27,860 --> 00:10:30,727
It's 500 bucks!
- How about the time deposit?

87
00:10:33,366 --> 00:10:36,460
Here's another 500 Rupees!
That makes it a grand!

88
00:10:36,669 --> 00:10:40,730
But how will we get a bike in 1000?
- We've just got to open an account.

89
00:10:41,374 --> 00:10:44,741
The same old gag, you mean?
Damn it!

90
00:10:48,981 --> 00:10:51,142
You have given me these
post-dated checks, thank you.

91
00:10:51,384 --> 00:10:55,343
Now for the last formalities. Sign
the papers and take away the bike.

92
00:10:59,125 --> 00:11:00,353
Go ahead, son.
Sign it.

93
00:11:11,404 --> 00:11:13,372
What's biting someone?
- Not me.

94
00:11:13,472 --> 00:11:14,939
It's out there!

95
00:11:18,411 --> 00:11:20,777
It's four guys against one!

96
00:11:21,747 --> 00:11:23,874
Listen, son...
that isn't unusual.

97
00:11:26,018 --> 00:11:28,384
Guys who issue dud checks
get beaten up like that.

98
00:11:28,587 --> 00:11:30,384
Those guys are from the financing agency.

99
00:11:30,589 --> 00:11:32,784
They have their own style
of recovering money.

100
00:11:33,426 --> 00:11:37,795
Dangerous style!
- 35 checks out of 36 were honored.

101
00:11:37,930 --> 00:11:41,798
But his last check bounced. Why?
- Such beating for one dud check?

102
00:11:41,934 --> 00:11:44,801
Sure... but you needn't worry.

103
00:11:44,937 --> 00:11:47,804
Why not?
- You guys come from good families.

104
00:11:48,174 --> 00:11:49,402
Do we?!

105
00:11:51,744 --> 00:11:55,043
Forget our checks.
We even carry cash that bounces!

106
00:11:55,448 --> 00:11:56,915
He doesn't, he means.
- Right!

107
00:12:02,955 --> 00:12:03,944
That's my pen!

108
00:12:08,728 --> 00:12:10,821
That's not the way you sit?
- This is Mumbai.

109
00:12:10,963 --> 00:12:13,431
You never know who does
what behind your back.

110
00:12:13,632 --> 00:12:16,430
Get going.
I'll handle the rear end!

111
00:12:21,474 --> 00:12:23,840
Hold it! Here's the studio!

112
00:12:29,982 --> 00:12:33,850
The guard saluted us because
we arrived on a bike.

113
00:12:33,986 --> 00:12:35,453
Or they wouldn't care!

114
00:12:35,621 --> 00:12:37,111
This is a very big studio.

115
00:12:37,389 --> 00:12:41,450
There's no one here, ma'am...
- No meetings without an appointment!

116
00:12:41,627 --> 00:12:44,118
Abdul! You're empty-handed!
No fruit-juice for me?

117
00:12:44,296 --> 00:12:47,857
No juices. I bring a singer today.
Raju. My friend from Goa.

118
00:12:48,000 --> 00:12:49,865
What a singer!
...is Mr. Mishra in?

119
00:12:50,002 --> 00:12:52,869
Please hold this blazer.
We'll go and see him.

120
00:12:53,005 --> 00:12:58,466
Punk! I don't get to see the owner
in the ten years I do the rounds here!

121
00:12:58,778 --> 00:13:01,474
And you guys just walk in
and get to meet him!

122
00:13:02,515 --> 00:13:06,474
Listen, bag of bones!
He'd blow you away with his breath!

123
00:13:06,719 --> 00:13:09,882
No! Don't breathe...!
Go on inside!

124
00:13:11,524 --> 00:13:14,493
What's your problem?
- They've gone in. So will I.

125
00:13:14,693 --> 00:13:16,490
I won't let you in!
- I'll force my way in!

126
00:13:16,629 --> 00:13:19,894
What will you do in there?
- Well...? What will I?

127
00:13:20,533 --> 00:13:23,900
Why was I here, mister?
- To ask for the whereabouts.

128
00:13:25,538 --> 00:13:27,904
This address, right?
- Yes. Take Bus No. 80.

129
00:13:28,541 --> 00:13:30,701
Get off at the last stop.
That's where your house is.

130
00:13:30,709 --> 00:13:32,904
Thank you very much!
Bus No. 80...

131
00:13:33,546 --> 00:13:37,505
Absent-minded man!
He forgets to sing once he's here...

132
00:13:37,683 --> 00:13:39,913
and goes back home. It's been
happening for 10 years!

133
00:13:41,554 --> 00:13:45,923
Mr. Mishra, that friend of mine I spoke
about is here. He's a great singer.

134
00:13:46,058 --> 00:13:48,526
Give him a chance, sir.
It'd make his life.

135
00:13:49,862 --> 00:13:53,525
Everyone who comes here
claims he's a great singer.

136
00:13:53,666 --> 00:13:55,531
Does anyone say he can't sing?

137
00:13:56,569 --> 00:13:58,935
When is Sonu Nigam arriving?
- Any moment now, sir.

138
00:14:13,586 --> 00:14:15,952
The name is Raju. From Goa.
I want to be a singer.

139
00:14:21,594 --> 00:14:24,961
Throw him out, guys!
- Relax... I want to be a singer.

140
00:14:43,382 --> 00:14:46,977
Do you know, darling;
I'm in love with you.

141
00:14:59,899 --> 00:15:03,596
You know it, darling;
I'm in love with you

142
00:15:19,885 --> 00:15:25,016
I'd do anything for you.

143
00:16:09,702 --> 00:16:12,671
What a singer!
You're fantastic!

144
00:16:12,838 --> 00:16:15,671
You're a top singer!
Oh yes you are!

145
00:16:15,874 --> 00:16:19,071
I'll be a singer, won't I?
- Will you?

146
00:16:19,712 --> 00:16:23,079
Who made Udit Narayan what he is?
I did!

147
00:16:23,215 --> 00:16:26,082
And who made Kumar Sanu's career?
I did!

148
00:16:26,352 --> 00:16:28,081
And Mohammad Rafi...?
- Rafi, too?

149
00:16:28,220 --> 00:16:31,087
No! He made my career!

150
00:16:31,724 --> 00:16:35,091
Now quickly record your songs
and bring the cassette to me.

151
00:16:36,729 --> 00:16:39,095
Isn't it the music companies
which records the songs, sir?

152
00:16:40,733 --> 00:16:42,701
I'll explain this to you.

153
00:16:42,901 --> 00:16:45,096
I've heard you sing.

154
00:16:45,237 --> 00:16:48,695
But how's the boss of my company,
Mahesh Hirwani, going to do that?

155
00:16:48,907 --> 00:16:53,105
I want your songs recorded
so he can listen to it.

156
00:16:53,245 --> 00:16:57,113
How much will it cost us
to have the songs recorded?

157
00:16:57,750 --> 00:17:00,116
Maybe a hundred thousand or 150,000

158
00:17:00,252 --> 00:17:03,119
150,000?!
- Maybe 200,000

159
00:17:03,255 --> 00:17:04,119
200,000?!

160
00:17:05,758 --> 00:17:10,127
You have the talent.
You're going to make money!

161
00:17:11,764 --> 00:17:15,723
200,000 bucks! That isn't money
we can find in our pockets!

162
00:17:15,934 --> 00:17:17,731
My career will be finished for 200,000.

163
00:17:17,903 --> 00:17:21,737
We haven't money for 2 liters
of petrol. And he wants 200,000!

164
00:17:21,940 --> 00:17:26,138
I can't push this anymore.
- Get your Uncle to pay for gas.

165
00:17:26,278 --> 00:17:30,146
I'll go to him. He must be angry
I haven't still gone to the shop.

166
00:17:30,282 --> 00:17:32,750
We'll buy gas with the money
I bring from him.

167
00:17:34,787 --> 00:17:37,153
Who's made a shop out of this bus shelter?

168
00:17:37,289 --> 00:17:39,154
Hey mister... who's made
a shop out of that?

169
00:17:39,291 --> 00:17:42,158
It's still a bus-shelter, mister.
A company's beautifying it.

170
00:17:42,795 --> 00:17:48,165
Still a bus stop! Strange!
It looks like a shop!

171
00:17:48,801 --> 00:17:50,769
That's a shop, Aba.
- It's a bus stop.

172
00:17:50,936 --> 00:17:52,767
It's a shop!
- A bus stop!

173
00:17:52,938 --> 00:17:56,169
Take a good look.
That's your uncle's new shop.

174
00:18:17,830 --> 00:18:21,197
You look very happy.
Have you scored with a girl?

175
00:18:21,834 --> 00:18:24,200
No, uncle.
- Why are you late, bloody dog!

176
00:18:24,336 --> 00:18:27,203
I got held up, uncle!
But why are you eating the remains?

177
00:18:27,840 --> 00:18:31,207
Remains, eh? I'll tell you.

178
00:18:32,010 --> 00:18:35,810
This is a sweet-lime.
The juice in it is my principal.

179
00:18:36,014 --> 00:18:38,209
Everything else in it is my interest.

180
00:18:38,350 --> 00:18:41,808
And you know, I never
let go of my interest!

181
00:18:42,020 --> 00:18:47,219
You've earned so much in interest.
You must at least eat well, uncle.

182
00:18:47,359 --> 00:18:52,228
God is kind. I eat the remains
of sweet-lime and orange.

183
00:18:53,365 --> 00:18:57,233
I used to sell sugarcane juice
when I first came to Mumbai.

184
00:18:57,369 --> 00:19:01,237
For two years, I lived only
on the remains of sugarcane!

185
00:19:01,373 --> 00:19:04,240
I'm glad, you didn't sell coconuts.
- Shut up!

186
00:19:05,377 --> 00:19:08,835
You've turned up after lunch-hour.
You lose half your salary!

187
00:19:10,382 --> 00:19:15,251
I have news, uncle. A friend of mine
from Goa is selling his shop.

188
00:19:15,387 --> 00:19:17,867
What's the big deal? He isn't
giving it away for free, is he?

189
00:19:18,190 --> 00:19:20,249
It's as good as free, uncle!

190
00:19:20,392 --> 00:19:25,261
How much would a 20 by 10 sq. feet
space sell for at Carter Road, Bandra?

191
00:19:25,531 --> 00:19:27,863
For anything between
1.5 or 2 million.

192
00:19:28,066 --> 00:19:30,193
He's giving it away at 200,000!

193
00:19:30,402 --> 00:19:32,267
At 200,000?

194
00:19:33,205 --> 00:19:37,266
But why's he giving it away
so cheap, my boy?

195
00:19:37,409 --> 00:19:40,276
He lives in Goa. How'd he know
of the prices in Mumbai?

196
00:19:40,546 --> 00:19:42,878
He's selling it at Goa's prices.
By Jove!

197
00:19:44,416 --> 00:19:47,283
I'm going to buy that shop!
I'm going to buy it!

198
00:19:48,420 --> 00:19:52,288
Where is this friend of yours?
- Out there... must I call him?

199
00:19:52,424 --> 00:19:55,291
No! Don't call him in!
Let him remain there.

200
00:19:55,561 --> 00:19:58,291
I'll get some unadulterated juice for him.

201
00:19:58,430 --> 00:20:00,295
Go on... Hurry up, my boy!

202
00:20:02,100 --> 00:20:04,898
The miser's fallen for it.
Do you want 20,00,000 instead?

203
00:20:05,270 --> 00:20:07,898
Don't be greedy. We need 200,000.
And that's all we'll take.

204
00:20:10,943 --> 00:20:15,312
This is Raju, uncle. And that's
my uncle. Not worthy of any praise.

205
00:20:15,948 --> 00:20:19,315
Sit down...
and have some juice.

206
00:20:19,451 --> 00:20:22,318
You're my nephew's friend, after all.

207
00:20:23,956 --> 00:20:28,325
My nephew told me that you're in
trouble and want to sell your shop.

208
00:20:28,961 --> 00:20:32,328
Don't worry. You will have no
problems till I'm around!

209
00:20:32,464 --> 00:20:34,329
I'll buy that shop!

210
00:20:34,466 --> 00:20:38,334
No sweat, uncle. There was this chap
here today. The deal's almost through.

211
00:20:38,971 --> 00:20:42,338
But the deal hasn't been struck.
- No! We only got talking!

212
00:20:42,474 --> 00:20:45,341
No deal yet.
- And why not?

213
00:20:45,477 --> 00:20:48,344
He wanted to pay me by check. I want
cash because I'm leaving for Goa.

214
00:20:48,480 --> 00:20:50,948
He wants it in cash, you see.
- I see!

215
00:20:51,149 --> 00:20:53,947
You can never say with these guys!
You must always get paid in cash!

216
00:20:54,152 --> 00:20:57,349
I'll pay it to you in cash.
Just you come with me! C'mon!

217
00:20:58,991 --> 00:21:00,959
He really doesn't deserve any praise!

218
00:21:01,994 --> 00:21:03,962
Here's 200,000!

219
00:21:04,162 --> 00:21:05,959
200,000? Or is it
two watermelons?

220
00:21:06,498 --> 00:21:09,365
Dangerous times, you know.
I've got to hide my dough!

221
00:21:09,501 --> 00:21:12,368
I put back in the fruit what
I earn from it... open it!

222
00:21:16,008 --> 00:21:19,375
My word, Uncle!
If only I knew...

223
00:21:21,346 --> 00:21:24,975
I'll start my new shop tomorrow and
serve you the first fruit-juice!

224
00:21:27,019 --> 00:21:30,386
It's made, uncle!
The shop's got made!

225
00:21:31,023 --> 00:21:34,390
Why's he laughing so much?
- He's happy, you see.

226
00:21:34,526 --> 00:21:36,994
He's going to Goa and he's delighted.

227
00:21:38,563 --> 00:21:42,397
Fantastic! You've got the dough!
We'll make a great cassette!

228
00:21:43,035 --> 00:21:45,401
And you will be the superstar!

229
00:22:05,824 --> 00:22:09,419
This is the first time it has
happened in my 17 or 18 years.

230
00:22:14,066 --> 00:22:18,025
This is the first time it has
happened in my lifetime.

231
00:22:18,403 --> 00:22:20,428
There's someone...

232
00:22:22,641 --> 00:22:26,441
There's someone I keep
thinking about all the time

233
00:23:42,354 --> 00:23:46,120
I dream of her, on silent nights.

234
00:23:46,658 --> 00:23:50,116
Lost I am, in things I do not know.

235
00:24:07,345 --> 00:24:10,542
The breeze blows the veil in the air.

236
00:24:11,183 --> 00:24:14,550
It sets my heart racing.

237
00:24:15,487 --> 00:24:19,150
Steady me, my friends

238
00:24:19,591 --> 00:24:22,560
I seem to be losing myself.

239
00:24:29,701 --> 00:24:33,569
Caught up, I always am, in these tresses.

240
00:25:35,200 --> 00:25:38,636
Footsteps awaken me.

241
00:25:39,271 --> 00:25:43,230
Why am I always chasing memories?

242
00:26:00,292 --> 00:26:03,659
My heart beats in loneliness

243
00:26:04,296 --> 00:26:07,663
I don't know whom it pines for.

244
00:26:08,300 --> 00:26:12,259
Tell me, someone.
I want to know...

245
00:26:12,637 --> 00:26:15,663
What's wrong with me?

246
00:26:22,314 --> 00:26:26,683
Include my name too in the
list of the crazy lovers.

247
00:26:31,323 --> 00:26:34,690
This is the first time it has
happened in my lifetime.

248
00:26:35,660 --> 00:26:37,685
There is someone...

249
00:26:39,331 --> 00:26:43,290
There is someone I keep
thinking about all the time.

250
00:27:08,360 --> 00:27:10,726
Hey! What's up with you?

251
00:27:12,364 --> 00:27:15,731
Stop dreaming!
You are the real star.

252
00:27:16,368 --> 00:27:19,735
He's only shaking his leg. And the
guys are going ga ga over the girls!

253
00:27:19,871 --> 00:27:24,331
You're going to be a big star!
This cassette... it's worth 200,000.

254
00:27:24,676 --> 00:27:28,737
Once the music company owners listens
to it... he's going to be fantastic!

255
00:27:34,886 --> 00:27:39,755
Let Misra make you star.
I'll deal with my uncle later.

256
00:27:42,394 --> 00:27:44,760
How are you...?
- Okay.

257
00:27:45,397 --> 00:27:48,366
Why the long face? Where's Misra?
- Up there.

258
00:27:48,900 --> 00:27:50,765
Up there? Have they
built another floor?

259
00:27:50,902 --> 00:27:52,767
No. He's dead.

260
00:27:57,142 --> 00:28:01,772
No, Misraji! You can't
leave me like this!

261
00:28:02,414 --> 00:28:04,780
This was no age for him to die!

262
00:28:04,916 --> 00:28:07,783
You wouldn't have died had
you waited for some more days!

263
00:28:17,429 --> 00:28:19,795
I want to die!
Deliver me, Ô Lord!

264
00:28:21,933 --> 00:28:25,801
Look! There's the owner of Music
Gramophone Company... Mahesh Hirwani!

265
00:28:26,438 --> 00:28:28,038
Go and see if the ambulance has arrived.

266
00:28:29,441 --> 00:28:31,409
Get up... hurry!

267
00:28:39,451 --> 00:28:40,918
It's okay... relax.

268
00:28:43,455 --> 00:28:46,822
What's all this, Maheshji!
- He's dead... so what?

269
00:28:51,963 --> 00:28:55,831
Do you know what he wanted most?
- Sure.

270
00:28:56,468 --> 00:28:58,436
He wanted my company
to be at the forefront.

271
00:28:59,471 --> 00:29:00,836
No?

272
00:29:01,873 --> 00:29:06,435
All right. He wanted our company to
always find the money... right?

273
00:29:06,978 --> 00:29:11,847
No!
- No? So what did he say?

274
00:29:15,487 --> 00:29:16,852
What's he saying?

275
00:29:17,789 --> 00:29:21,452
Mr. Mishra wanted him to be
a successful singer!

276
00:29:21,993 --> 00:29:24,461
What?! These bloody
aspirants...

277
00:29:24,796 --> 00:29:26,957
Take them away...

278
00:29:27,999 --> 00:29:30,467
I wonder where these guys land up from!

279
00:29:35,507 --> 00:29:36,872
Take the madcap away!

280
00:29:39,511 --> 00:29:40,876
Go on.

281
00:29:41,513 --> 00:29:43,481
Weeping can make you tired.
- Sure.

282
00:29:45,517 --> 00:29:49,476
Why are they noting our license number?
- Must be a no-parking zone.

283
00:29:49,821 --> 00:29:52,881
But when did the traffic cops
take to dressing like that?

284
00:29:53,525 --> 00:29:55,125
They aren't the cops brothers, are they?

285
00:29:55,126 --> 00:29:59,895
No... I think they're
those thugs!

286
00:30:00,031 --> 00:30:02,898
The first check we issued has bounced!

287
00:30:03,034 --> 00:30:04,899
Go on...
- I'll find a way.

288
00:30:07,539 --> 00:30:09,507
What's the point in eying the bike now?

289
00:30:09,707 --> 00:30:13,507
What do you mean?
- The guy who owned it is dead.

290
00:30:13,678 --> 00:30:17,512
What do you mean?
- He's dead. His body's lying inside.

291
00:30:18,550 --> 00:30:22,509
We'd even get the corpse
to pay us, okay? C'mon guys!

292
00:30:27,559 --> 00:30:28,685
Sit!

293
00:30:36,568 --> 00:30:40,937
The moment I open my shop, the
customers make a beeline for it!

294
00:30:41,072 --> 00:30:43,939
That's what you get when you
have a shop on a busy road!

295
00:30:46,544 --> 00:30:50,947
Thanks a million, Lord!
Let the queues continue!

296
00:30:56,588 --> 00:30:58,055
Where have they gone?

297
00:30:58,590 --> 00:31:02,959
They must've taken my shop
for a bus-shelter!

298
00:31:08,099 --> 00:31:09,964
It's an earthquake!

299
00:31:10,602 --> 00:31:11,967
Help!

300
00:31:12,604 --> 00:31:15,971
Everything's okay out there...
so why's my shop being shaken up?

301
00:31:22,614 --> 00:31:25,583
Somebody stop them!
Police! Police!

302
00:31:26,618 --> 00:31:28,586
What's happening here?
- Stop them, Inspector!

303
00:31:28,786 --> 00:31:30,981
They've squeezed my shop!

304
00:31:31,589 --> 00:31:33,989
Who asked you to start a shop
at a public bus shelter?

305
00:31:36,628 --> 00:31:38,596
Is this a bus-shelter?!

306
00:31:49,807 --> 00:31:52,105
No! It can't be true!

307
00:31:52,310 --> 00:31:55,006
This is a railway station!
There'll be trains here soon!

308
00:31:55,246 --> 00:31:58,010
Have you gone mad?
- Sure! I've gone mad!

309
00:31:58,149 --> 00:32:02,017
I've gone mad...!
I've lost 200,000!

310
00:32:02,153 --> 00:32:04,621
My stuff is all garbage!

311
00:32:04,956 --> 00:32:08,016
Stop this guy! He's the
one who has robbed me!

312
00:32:09,994 --> 00:32:13,020
Stop! Where do you think
you're going?!

313
00:32:16,668 --> 00:32:20,035
Get down! Get down!

314
00:32:24,943 --> 00:32:27,309
Inspector! It was this guy
who sold me that shop!

315
00:32:28,680 --> 00:32:30,648
Look... your uncle.
There are cops too.

316
00:32:30,982 --> 00:32:33,041
Who sold the shop to you?
- Good God!

317
00:32:35,186 --> 00:32:38,053
He's the one who sold it to me!

318
00:32:38,690 --> 00:32:41,659
He's the one!
The bloody crook!

319
00:32:41,793 --> 00:32:43,317
Get him, constables!

320
00:32:43,695 --> 00:32:45,663
Go on, mister...
he's targeting everyone.

321
00:32:55,206 --> 00:32:57,674
What the hell have I done...?

322
00:32:58,209 --> 00:33:03,078
Forgive me...!

323
00:33:34,746 --> 00:33:38,705
Get him, constables!
This guy's really gone mad!

324
00:33:41,753 --> 00:33:43,721
It's my misfortune, Aba.

325
00:33:45,056 --> 00:33:50,722
We've lost 200,000. And I haven't
even got to be a star.

326
00:33:51,763 --> 00:33:54,129
Neither did I find my dream-girl
nor is my dream realized.

327
00:33:55,933 --> 00:34:01,132
God keeps giving us those signals.
But we're fools not to notice them.

328
00:34:01,773 --> 00:34:03,741
Take Misra's death, for instance.

329
00:34:04,776 --> 00:34:07,142
That is to suggest that I have
entered the wrong lane.

330
00:34:11,282 --> 00:34:13,750
Mrs. Godinho's back there in Goa.
I think I'll go to her.

331
00:34:14,352 --> 00:34:18,152
What? You have ruined my life.
And you'll go back to Mrs. Godinho?

332
00:34:18,790 --> 00:34:22,749
Very well. You had to come along
and spoil things even more for me.

333
00:34:22,960 --> 00:34:25,758
There's your signal...
so go to Goa!

334
00:34:26,097 --> 00:34:29,157
You've been a great support, Aba.
- And that was a mistake?

335
00:34:29,300 --> 00:34:31,165
I'll give you something before I leave.

336
00:34:31,803 --> 00:34:34,169
What will you give me anyway?
- The bike's all yours.

337
00:34:35,306 --> 00:34:39,174
The keys belong to you. And this
cassette is for your uncle.

338
00:34:41,813 --> 00:34:44,179
Those thugs will beat me up for the bike...

339
00:34:44,315 --> 00:34:46,515
and my uncle will beat me up
for this bloody cassette!

340
00:34:46,516 --> 00:34:49,184
Happy Diwali, fatso!
- What Diwali?!

341
00:34:49,320 --> 00:34:52,187
He's only wishing you.
- I'm doomed, anyway!

342
00:34:52,323 --> 00:34:55,190
Now either kill me.
Or I'm going to kill myself!

343
00:34:55,827 --> 00:34:56,794
Right now!

344
00:34:57,829 --> 00:34:58,949
Do you want to kill someone?

345
00:35:30,061 --> 00:35:30,925
Look at this.

346
00:35:33,164 --> 00:35:34,426
It's a bride.

347
00:35:46,144 --> 00:35:47,824
The train's coming...
get out of the way!

348
00:35:47,879 --> 00:35:50,245
Get the hell out of there!

349
00:35:53,684 --> 00:35:55,345
Don't be crazy!
Leave the girl alone!

350
00:36:00,791 --> 00:36:02,258
Get out, Raju!
The train's coming!

351
00:36:55,112 --> 00:36:58,309
Thank God for the car which saved her life!

352
00:36:58,950 --> 00:37:01,919
Take her to the operation theatre
and inform Dr. Chander. Quick!

353
00:37:07,959 --> 00:37:09,927
Do you know her, sir?
- Of course.

354
00:37:10,962 --> 00:37:12,930
Who brought her here?
- Her husband did.

355
00:37:25,476 --> 00:37:27,341
I want you to check
this man's mental health.

356
00:37:27,478 --> 00:37:29,946
He started a fruit-juice shop
at a bus shelter.

357
00:37:30,147 --> 00:37:33,947
We want to know if he's really mad
or whether he's faking it.

358
00:37:35,286 --> 00:37:38,346
Why have you come in here?
Please go out.

359
00:37:39,490 --> 00:37:41,617
This is an operation theatre.
- Take him away.

360
00:37:41,726 --> 00:37:43,125
No... I won't go out.

361
00:37:43,327 --> 00:37:44,954
That's the lady's husband.

362
00:37:45,997 --> 00:37:48,363
Please, doctor...
- Now look, son.

363
00:37:50,001 --> 00:37:53,368
But you must go out.
- Please don't do that, doctor.

364
00:37:53,504 --> 00:37:56,371
Nothing will happen to your wife.
- My wife...? Oh yes! My wife!

365
00:37:56,507 --> 00:37:59,374
She's lying there all-alone!
And I've never let her be lonely.

366
00:37:59,510 --> 00:38:01,375
How can I leave her like this?

367
00:38:01,512 --> 00:38:04,970
Please let me be here with her.
Quietly. In a corner.

368
00:38:12,523 --> 00:38:17,392
The nurse's given me a sleeping pill.
- An injection. Not a pill.

369
00:38:21,032 --> 00:38:23,000
May I sit down?

370
00:38:48,059 --> 00:38:50,425
What's happened to my child?

371
00:38:53,064 --> 00:38:56,431
What's wrong, dear?

372
00:38:56,701 --> 00:39:00,034
On the day of a festival?

373
00:39:00,538 --> 00:39:03,439
How's Pooja, K.D.?

374
00:39:10,081 --> 00:39:11,548
What injuries has she received?

375
00:39:11,816 --> 00:39:13,443
No injuries as such.

376
00:39:18,389 --> 00:39:21,449
She has suffered a head injury.
Back there... at the rear end.

377
00:39:22,093 --> 00:39:24,459
Because of which she had
a brain hemorrhage.

378
00:39:25,596 --> 00:39:28,463
Because of the force of the blood,
she's now in a coma.

379
00:39:30,101 --> 00:39:35,061
We have conducted an operation to
lessen the pressure on her mind.

380
00:39:35,740 --> 00:39:40,074
In medical terms, we call this
a state of coma vigil.

381
00:39:42,113 --> 00:39:47,483
Which means, she can hear, listen and
understand. But she can't speak.

382
00:39:52,123 --> 00:39:54,489
Pooja will be all right, won't she?

383
00:40:02,133 --> 00:40:06,092
If only you had agreed to Pooja's
marriage with Romi, sir...

384
00:40:06,637 --> 00:40:08,502
we wouldn't have had to see this day.

385
00:40:09,140 --> 00:40:11,506
But Pooja is already married!
- What?

386
00:40:11,642 --> 00:40:14,509
She was brought here in a bridal dress.

387
00:40:14,645 --> 00:40:16,510
It was her husband who saved her.

388
00:40:16,647 --> 00:40:18,512
Romi...?
- Of course.

389
00:40:18,649 --> 00:40:19,616
Where is he?

390
00:40:27,558 --> 00:40:32,518
Romi has risked his own life to save Pooja.

391
00:40:33,164 --> 00:40:37,123
Did you... jump before a speeding
train to save Pooja's life?

392
00:40:37,468 --> 00:40:39,708
I only did my duty.
- You have saved not Pooja alone...

393
00:40:39,709 --> 00:40:42,138
you have saved the whole family, son.

394
00:40:42,673 --> 00:40:45,540
Why only Pooja? I'd have done it
for anyone in her place.

395
00:40:49,180 --> 00:40:54,550
I was wrong, son. We turned down the
match, without even meeting you.

396
00:40:55,186 --> 00:40:59,782
We thought you weren't good enough
for Pooja and for our family.

397
00:41:02,193 --> 00:41:07,563
I have nothing to do with what you
thought and what you now think, sir.

398
00:41:08,199 --> 00:41:12,158
That's because...
- How were we to know, son...?

399
00:41:12,503 --> 00:41:15,563
That you'd be the angel
to come into our lives?

400
00:41:16,207 --> 00:41:22,578
Thank a million, Lord, for
sending him into Pooja's life.

401
00:41:27,218 --> 00:41:32,178
Now look, ma'am. I have nothing
to do with Pooja or you.

402
00:41:32,623 --> 00:41:35,592
Just please forgive me.
And please let me go.

403
00:41:35,860 --> 00:41:40,593
Don't say such things, son.
I realize I've made a mistake.

404
00:41:41,232 --> 00:41:43,200
That I should have at least have met you!

405
00:41:44,235 --> 00:41:47,602
I should have tried to understand you.
Please forgive me, son.

406
00:41:47,738 --> 00:41:49,603
Please forgive me...
- Who are you folks?

407
00:41:49,740 --> 00:41:52,607
Who on earth are all of you...?
Please let me go... please!

408
00:41:52,910 --> 00:41:57,210
My boss is asking for pardon. You
mustn't leave Pooja in this state!

409
00:41:57,715 --> 00:42:01,617
I seek your pardon, sir!
I have enough tensions in life.

410
00:42:01,752 --> 00:42:05,620
I've got to sing... I mean, go!
...how am I going to explain?!

411
00:42:13,264 --> 00:42:16,631
Get this straight, my good man.
I must see Mr. Oberoi.

412
00:42:16,767 --> 00:42:21,227
Maybe. But he's in the ICU after
a heart attack. You can't see him.

413
00:42:21,605 --> 00:42:24,233
Damn it! Is this a hospital
or is it a prison?

414
00:42:24,575 --> 00:42:29,239
Now look; I'm not keeping well.
I'm going to get a heart attack.

415
00:42:29,446 --> 00:42:31,641
Let me meet him...
- Skip the drama!

416
00:42:32,283 --> 00:42:34,251
Well, all right.
Here you are.

417
00:42:34,451 --> 00:42:37,648
You're trying to bribe me, are you?
I'm not going to let you in at all!

418
00:42:37,788 --> 00:42:39,653
What a madcap!
Make him see reason!

419
00:42:41,025 --> 00:42:42,890
What are you doing here?
Go to your wife.

420
00:42:43,294 --> 00:42:45,262
Look at him!

421
00:42:46,864 --> 00:42:49,304
He barged into a funeral the
other day. And he's here today.

422
00:42:49,500 --> 00:42:52,264
You let those two-penny guys in
and stop rich folks like me!

423
00:42:52,469 --> 00:42:55,666
That chap is Mr. Bharat Oberoi's
son-in-law.

424
00:42:55,806 --> 00:42:58,274
Maybe... what?!
- That's right.

425
00:42:58,475 --> 00:43:01,273
Mr. Bharat Oberoi's son-in-law.
He's Pooja's husband.

426
00:43:02,313 --> 00:43:04,679
Pooja even has a husband...
the jerk!

427
00:43:05,215 --> 00:43:06,682
Why am I always the fall guy?

428
00:43:08,319 --> 00:43:10,287
I'm not blaming you.

429
00:43:10,487 --> 00:43:11,954
But why me?

430
00:43:14,325 --> 00:43:18,284
I'm leaving now. Tell your folks
that I'm not Romi.

431
00:43:23,334 --> 00:43:27,703
That you met with an accident and I
happened to be there to save you...

432
00:43:27,838 --> 00:43:31,296
is a signal that you have
a long life ahead of you.

433
00:43:32,343 --> 00:43:36,712
And make sure you drive slowly in future.

434
00:43:49,860 --> 00:43:53,728
What is it now?
- I've heard what you said to her.

435
00:43:54,365 --> 00:43:57,732
Have you? Then you must know
I'm Raj. I'm not Romi.

436
00:43:57,868 --> 00:44:01,736
So go and tell them! Please!
- No! I can't tell them!

437
00:44:01,872 --> 00:44:04,739
My boss has had a heart attack.
I can't tell him all that.

438
00:44:04,875 --> 00:44:08,743
You don't think I'm a doctor, do you?
- You know what state Pooja is in.

439
00:44:09,380 --> 00:44:13,749
Should I tell him that you're not
Romi... I don't know what'll happen.

440
00:44:13,884 --> 00:44:19,754
Please stay back! I have seen hope
in his eyes since you have arrived.

441
00:44:20,391 --> 00:44:24,350
Who are you anyway?
And what makes you so interested?

442
00:44:24,561 --> 00:44:28,759
I'm nothing more than an accountant.
But I've been with him for 30 years.

443
00:44:28,899 --> 00:44:30,764
He has always treated me like a brother.

444
00:44:31,402 --> 00:44:35,771
I beg for his life...
Please don't go away.

445
00:44:35,906 --> 00:44:41,776
He treats me like nothing, okay?
So I beg of you for my life...

446
00:44:41,912 --> 00:44:45,780
I've taken enough in life anyway.
Give me a break. Please!

447
00:44:45,916 --> 00:44:47,781
See?... now step aside.

448
00:44:50,921 --> 00:44:53,788
Son-in-law! How are you?
- You, sir?

449
00:44:53,924 --> 00:44:58,793
Don't embarrass me by calling me sir!

450
00:44:58,929 --> 00:45:00,794
Son-in-law?
- You're Pooja's husband.

451
00:45:00,931 --> 00:45:03,399
Why didn't you tell me you're
Mr. Oberoi's son-in-law?

452
00:45:05,469 --> 00:45:08,802
Fantastic! You are
Mr. Oberoi's son-in-law!

453
00:45:10,441 --> 00:45:11,806
What's fantastic about that?

454
00:45:16,447 --> 00:45:18,415
It's indeed amazing,
son-in-law.

455
00:45:18,749 --> 00:45:21,809
Honestly, when I saw you weeping
at Misra's funeral the other day...

456
00:45:21,952 --> 00:45:25,820
I knew for sure that
it was a son-in-law...

457
00:45:25,956 --> 00:45:28,823
that you have the Goddess's blessings.

458
00:45:28,959 --> 00:45:31,826
What a melodious way
of crying! Indeed!

459
00:45:32,096 --> 00:45:35,429
I've yet to see a son-in-law cry,
errr... sing, like you!

460
00:45:35,766 --> 00:45:37,825
You are undoubtedly the
son-in-law No. 1!

461
00:45:38,469 --> 00:45:41,438
And what happens to this cassette?
- To hell with this one!

462
00:45:41,972 --> 00:45:44,839
I'll have a fresh one recorded
for you... just you see!

463
00:45:44,975 --> 00:45:48,843
I'll give it a release so grand
that no son-in-law...

464
00:45:48,979 --> 00:45:50,844
...I mean, no singer
has ever had!

465
00:45:50,981 --> 00:45:52,846
So just drop in at my office tomorrow.

466
00:45:55,152 --> 00:45:58,246
The son-in-law...
my Statue of Liberty!

467
00:45:59,757 --> 00:46:03,853
Find Romi quickly, Goverdhan.
Brother's been asking for him.

468
00:46:05,496 --> 00:46:06,963
Go ahead. I'll find him.

469
00:46:07,164 --> 00:46:10,861
Romi ought to be with my brother.
That's what the doctor says.

470
00:46:11,001 --> 00:46:12,866
So bring him quickly.

471
00:46:17,508 --> 00:46:21,467
God Almighty... where will
I bring him from?

472
00:46:23,514 --> 00:46:25,482
And what will I tell them?

473
00:46:29,019 --> 00:46:31,886
Stop crying... Romi's here.

474
00:46:32,523 --> 00:46:34,491
Really?
- Yes.

475
00:46:34,691 --> 00:46:38,889
I thought that if playing Romi
could save Bharatbhai's life...

476
00:46:39,029 --> 00:46:42,897
so why not? Saving a life
is anyway a noble deed.

477
00:46:45,836 --> 00:46:48,336
You're a great boy...
Let's go. He's asking for you.

478
00:47:03,554 --> 00:47:07,923
Open your eyes, Bharat...
look who's here.

479
00:47:09,560 --> 00:47:15,931
I will hold something against you.
Why wasn't I born as your son?

480
00:47:24,575 --> 00:47:26,941
Open Sesame!
- Hey! This is her bag.

481
00:47:27,077 --> 00:47:28,957
Correction. It was hers.
It now belongs to us.

482
00:47:29,079 --> 00:47:30,944
Look! Jewellery worth
half a million.

483
00:47:31,081 --> 00:47:34,949
A laptop. The stuff's
worth over a million!

484
00:47:35,085 --> 00:47:36,950
My life is made, Raju!

485
00:47:37,087 --> 00:47:40,955
I'm shedding tears of joy!
- Don't cry. I'll return the bag.

486
00:47:41,592 --> 00:47:44,959
Return it?! Whatever for?
- To steal is a sin, Aba.

487
00:47:45,095 --> 00:47:46,960
I see! A sin, eh?

488
00:47:47,097 --> 00:47:51,966
We conned my uncle into buying a bus
shelter as a shop. Wasn't that a sin?

489
00:47:52,102 --> 00:47:53,967
We did that for my career.
- I see.

490
00:47:54,104 --> 00:47:56,971
Wasn't it a sin to issue a check
for 30,000 when you had just 1000?

491
00:47:57,274 --> 00:48:00,209
That was to further my career.
- Oh great! For your career!

492
00:48:00,611 --> 00:48:03,978
And now that I land some dough,
it's all wrong!

493
00:48:04,114 --> 00:48:07,982
Now look; I did every wrong only
for my career. And I've got my break.

494
00:48:08,118 --> 00:48:10,278
Who's giving it to you?
- Know whose daughter she is?

495
00:48:10,279 --> 00:48:11,985
She's the daughter of Bharat Oberoi!

496
00:48:16,126 --> 00:48:18,993
And Mahesh Hirwani...?
- What's up?

497
00:48:19,296 --> 00:48:21,594
Is he dead?
- He's giving me the break!

498
00:48:21,798 --> 00:48:23,595
I see. He's going to die soon.

499
00:48:23,767 --> 00:48:27,601
Know what Mrs. Godinho
always says?

500
00:48:28,138 --> 00:48:33,007
We meet God at every step in life;
It's just that we don't recognize him.

501
00:48:33,644 --> 00:48:36,010
Have you ever been drenched in the rains?

502
00:48:36,146 --> 00:48:39,013
Sure. On many occasions.
- Has anyone offered you an umbrella?

503
00:48:39,149 --> 00:48:41,014
Sure.
- You didn't recognize him

504
00:48:41,151 --> 00:48:43,016
I did. It was Babban!
- It wasn't Babban...

505
00:48:43,654 --> 00:48:46,623
It was God!
- God? Babban?

506
00:48:47,658 --> 00:48:52,027
Have you ever lay there,
without anything to eat?

507
00:48:52,162 --> 00:48:55,620
It's happened so many times.
- Did someone come and feed you?

508
00:48:55,799 --> 00:48:59,633
Sure. The milkmaid did.
- It wasn't the milkmaid.

509
00:49:00,170 --> 00:49:02,035
That was God, too.

510
00:49:02,673 --> 00:49:05,039
I met God last night too.

511
00:49:05,676 --> 00:49:11,046
And God gave me a break.
- I see! God has given you the break!

512
00:49:11,181 --> 00:49:16,050
How could I forget to tell you?
I met God last night too.

513
00:49:16,186 --> 00:49:18,051
Who?
- The one who gave you the break...

514
00:49:18,188 --> 00:49:20,053
and gave me this bag!
- Hold it!

515
00:49:20,190 --> 00:49:24,058
I'm going to return that bag!
- You can't take away what God gives!

516
00:49:25,195 --> 00:49:29,063
God hasn't given you that bag, Aba.
You've stolen it from him.

517
00:49:29,199 --> 00:49:32,066
And it's a sin to steal from God.
Give that to me, Aba.

518
00:49:33,003 --> 00:49:34,664
Take it!

519
00:49:40,711 --> 00:49:43,077
No! Not anymore, please!

520
00:49:43,714 --> 00:49:46,308
How are you?
- I'm okay, no thank you.

521
00:49:46,717 --> 00:49:49,686
How many fingers are these?
- Five, thank you!

522
00:49:49,853 --> 00:49:52,083
And who am I?
- The Inspector!

523
00:49:52,222 --> 00:49:54,690
Where are you, at the moment?
- In a hospital, no thank you!

524
00:49:55,726 --> 00:49:58,092
Was that a bus-stop or was it
a fruit-juice stall?

525
00:49:58,228 --> 00:50:00,093
It was a bloody bus stop!

526
00:50:00,731 --> 00:50:02,699
Looks like he's all right, doctor.

527
00:50:03,033 --> 00:50:06,093
Are you hungry?
- I'm famished!

528
00:50:06,236 --> 00:50:10,104
What will you eat?
- Remains of all the fruits!

529
00:50:12,242 --> 00:50:14,710
Give him some more shock, doctor.
He isn't all right.

530
00:50:17,748 --> 00:50:23,118
No worry. That's the mental ward.
Such noises are commonplace.

531
00:50:30,761 --> 00:50:33,127
It's day already... wake up.

532
00:50:33,764 --> 00:50:36,130
Here's your bag.
It was with my friend.

533
00:50:36,266 --> 00:50:41,727
You'll find everything intact. Except
5000 Rupees, which my friend has spent.

534
00:50:42,272 --> 00:50:45,730
But I'll return the money as soon
as you regain consciousness.

535
00:50:47,044 --> 00:50:49,137
I had told you that I would
never meet you again.

536
00:50:49,780 --> 00:50:53,147
But Mr. Goverdhan has requested me
to stay back...

537
00:50:53,283 --> 00:50:55,751
and play Romi till your dad gets well.

538
00:50:56,086 --> 00:50:58,748
I have my interests at heart too.
I'm a singer, you know?

539
00:51:00,090 --> 00:51:03,150
Mahesh Hirwani is going to
release an album of mine...

540
00:51:03,293 --> 00:51:05,158
because he thinks I'm your husband.

541
00:51:05,295 --> 00:51:07,763
My life is made!

542
00:51:08,298 --> 00:51:11,165
Someday I will recite a song for you.

543
00:51:11,535 --> 00:51:14,163
Why someday? Let me recite it
for you right now.

544
00:51:16,306 --> 00:51:19,173
You must give me a big hand
if you like the song, okay?

545
00:51:25,315 --> 00:51:30,184
It will laugh;
It will cry.

546
00:51:30,320 --> 00:51:34,188
It will find someone;
And it will lose someone.

547
00:51:36,326 --> 00:51:41,195
In solitude, it will suffer.

548
00:51:43,299 --> 00:51:46,063
That's every heart in love.

549
00:51:48,704 --> 00:51:51,673
Come, Romi... they're asking for you.

550
00:51:52,708 --> 00:51:55,074
Has Mr. Goverdhan arrived?
- Not yet. But come on.

551
00:51:55,211 --> 00:51:57,076
They want to ask you something.

552
00:51:57,713 --> 00:52:01,672
What? What do they want to ask?
- Why are you scared?

553
00:52:02,718 --> 00:52:05,084
I'll come after
Mr. Goverdhan arrives.

554
00:52:05,221 --> 00:52:09,089
Of course he will arrive.
Now come on... C'mon!

555
00:52:11,393 --> 00:52:13,088
How can I believe that you are Romi?

556
00:52:14,463 --> 00:52:16,090
Give it a thought.

557
00:52:16,232 --> 00:52:19,099
When the accident occurred,
Pooja was at the wheels and you...

558
00:52:23,405 --> 00:52:28,104
That's Monty from America.
He's my sister-in-law's son.

559
00:52:28,244 --> 00:52:30,109
And this is Romi.

560
00:52:32,248 --> 00:52:34,113
I can't believe he's Romi.

561
00:52:35,150 --> 00:52:37,710
Any proof?
- I am the proof.

562
00:52:37,886 --> 00:52:39,717
I know he's Romi.

563
00:52:40,756 --> 00:52:43,122
Pooja had once introduced me to him.

564
00:52:43,259 --> 00:52:46,126
Really? When was that?
- Actually, when Pooja and I...

565
00:52:46,262 --> 00:52:51,131
went to buy a computer for her,
we had lunch together. Right?

566
00:52:51,767 --> 00:52:54,133
You have spoilt her with your indulgence.

567
00:52:54,270 --> 00:52:57,137
You kept her secret without
telling us anything.

568
00:52:57,439 --> 00:53:00,135
I thought I'd tell you when the time came.

569
00:53:01,277 --> 00:53:04,144
When are we doing the recording, sir?
- We're doing it, son-in-law...

570
00:53:04,280 --> 00:53:07,147
it'll be done in good time.
Just don't worry!

571
00:53:07,783 --> 00:53:11,150
Don't mention his name as
son-in-law on the album.

572
00:53:13,289 --> 00:53:14,756
He's kidding!

573
00:53:14,923 --> 00:53:17,756
The album will have it
in bold print: Romi!

574
00:53:17,960 --> 00:53:20,758
Not Romi. It ought to be Raj.
- Raj?

575
00:53:22,798 --> 00:53:25,164
Your name is Romi!
- Right.

576
00:53:25,301 --> 00:53:27,166
But the album will say Raj.
- Why?

577
00:53:27,303 --> 00:53:30,170
Why did Yusuf Khan choose
to call himself Dilip Kumar?

578
00:53:30,806 --> 00:53:32,774
Because that was a lucky name for him.

579
00:53:33,809 --> 00:53:37,176
I see!
So Raj is a lucky name for you!

580
00:53:37,813 --> 00:53:39,781
So we'll call you Raj.
What's the big deal?

581
00:53:40,015 --> 00:53:45,783
When are we doing the recording?
- We're busy this year.

582
00:53:45,988 --> 00:53:49,788
But I promise. Yours will be the
first album next year.

583
00:53:50,025 --> 00:53:52,186
A year? Impossible!

584
00:53:52,494 --> 00:53:56,191
I had told you, Raj. HMV promises
to release the album in 3 months.

585
00:53:56,832 --> 00:54:00,791
And what did Polygram say?
- 15 days, they promised.

586
00:54:01,003 --> 00:54:02,800
So let's go!
- Hold it, guys.

587
00:54:02,938 --> 00:54:04,838
You guys get worked up for nothing!

588
00:54:04,839 --> 00:54:07,206
Wow! You're into Moonwalking!
You're a born star!

589
00:54:07,343 --> 00:54:10,210
Sit down... Go on.
- What for?

590
00:54:10,846 --> 00:54:13,815
It'll require at least 8 days to...
- 8 days!

591
00:54:14,183 --> 00:54:16,811
That's a very long time.
- Be reasonable, guys.

592
00:54:17,353 --> 00:54:20,811
You know what a busy music composer
Anu Malik is, don't you?

593
00:54:21,023 --> 00:54:25,221
He's away in Europe.
You must wait for him to return.

594
00:54:26,862 --> 00:54:29,228
Besides, Pooja's in hospital.
Would it be okay...

595
00:54:29,365 --> 00:54:32,232
to record it without her?
- It's Pooja I'm doing all this for.

596
00:54:34,169 --> 00:54:37,832
Pooja will spring to her feet,
the moment she listens to my song.

597
00:54:39,875 --> 00:54:43,242
Mr. Goverdhan!
- Congratulations!

598
00:54:43,879 --> 00:54:46,245
All our tensions are over!
- They're over!

599
00:54:46,882 --> 00:54:49,248
We have no problems in future!
- No problems!

600
00:54:49,385 --> 00:54:51,250
Let's go and tell Bharatbhai the truth!

601
00:54:52,388 --> 00:54:55,028
Here's where the problem lies.
I won't tell Bharatbhai the truth.

602
00:54:55,057 --> 00:54:57,252
Why not?
- I don't want to!

603
00:54:57,393 --> 00:55:00,260
Like you didn't want it earlier.
- You have evil on your mind.

604
00:55:00,896 --> 00:55:03,865
No matter what. I won't tell him!
- I'll go and tell him then.

605
00:55:08,070 --> 00:55:09,537
So I'll tell him!

606
00:55:12,408 --> 00:55:16,276
I'll go and tell him the truth!
- I'll tell him too...

607
00:55:16,412 --> 00:55:19,677
about the conspiracy you had hatched!
- What plan?

608
00:55:19,915 --> 00:55:23,282
Whose plan?
- Have you forgotten what you told me?

609
00:55:23,419 --> 00:55:25,619
The old man has millions!
He'll die of a heart attack.

610
00:55:26,422 --> 00:55:30,290
That you'd strangle the girl and
we'd split the millions between us!

611
00:55:30,426 --> 00:55:32,894
What rubbish...
are you talking!

612
00:55:33,929 --> 00:55:36,898
I could never imagine you'd
be such a cheapskate!

613
00:55:37,099 --> 00:55:39,567
I'm not a cheapskate!
You're compelling me to be one!

614
00:55:39,935 --> 00:55:42,563
Go out... I've got to make her change.
- Okay, we're going out.

615
00:55:42,771 --> 00:55:45,569
Not him. He's her husband.
He'll help me.

616
00:55:46,742 --> 00:55:49,302
Go on... please.
- Listen to me!

617
00:55:56,952 --> 00:55:58,317
Please pull that sheet.

618
00:56:30,986 --> 00:56:33,352
She has...

619
00:56:33,989 --> 00:56:36,355
She has a mole there!
- God!

620
00:56:36,992 --> 00:56:39,358
Disgusting! Bloody disgusting!

621
00:56:42,498 --> 00:56:45,365
I've never seen such a husband.
He shut his eyes...

622
00:56:45,501 --> 00:56:48,959
when I asked him to change his
wife's clothes and grabbed my skirt!

623
00:56:57,012 --> 00:56:58,775
You're an amazing man!

624
00:57:01,517 --> 00:57:04,384
You aren't as rotten as I thought you were.

625
00:57:04,686 --> 00:57:07,382
And you're a much better man
than I thought you to be.

626
00:57:07,823 --> 00:57:11,384
You know Mahesh Hirwani, don't you?

627
00:57:12,127 --> 00:57:14,391
Sure. I do know him.
What is it about?

628
00:57:14,530 --> 00:57:16,370
He thinks I'm really
Bharatbhai's son-in-law.

629
00:57:16,532 --> 00:57:19,399
How many fingers on my hand?
- Five fingers, thank you!

630
00:57:19,535 --> 00:57:22,003
Who am I?
- The Inspector, no thank you!

631
00:57:22,204 --> 00:57:23,796
And who's that?
- The doctor!

632
00:57:24,206 --> 00:57:27,403
Are you hungry?
- I'm famished, I swear!

633
00:57:27,543 --> 00:57:31,411
And what will you eat?
- Rice and lentil-curry. Anything!

634
00:57:33,048 --> 00:57:35,414
Very good! He seems to be
all right now, doctor.

635
00:57:36,051 --> 00:57:40,420
Now tell me; why did you start a
fruit-juice stall at a bus stop?

636
00:57:41,056 --> 00:57:45,425
There was this scoundrel who claimed
to own it and sold it to me!

637
00:57:45,727 --> 00:57:51,427
How much did you buy it for?
- 200,000!

638
00:57:52,267 --> 00:57:53,427
Whom did you buy it from?

639
00:57:54,069 --> 00:57:57,436
Speak up... whom did
you buy it from?

640
00:57:59,074 --> 00:58:01,440
It was that scoundrel I bought it from!

641
00:58:02,077 --> 00:58:04,443
It was that scoundrel!

642
00:58:04,580 --> 00:58:07,048
He isn't all right, doctor!
Give him the shock!

643
00:58:09,885 --> 00:58:13,048
Once the recording is over,
I'll tell them that I'm not Romi.

644
00:58:13,722 --> 00:58:19,456
Know something? What would God lose
if you were the real Romi?

645
00:58:21,096 --> 00:58:24,463
Are you coming or going?
I've been looking for you.

646
00:58:25,100 --> 00:58:29,059
Mr. Goverdhan! It's you
he's talking to!

647
00:58:31,106 --> 00:58:34,473
I couldn't tell whether he was
talking on the phone or addressing me.

648
00:58:35,110 --> 00:58:37,476
I have news for you.
There was a call from Jahnvi.

649
00:58:37,613 --> 00:58:39,478
Really...? That's my
daughter who called.

650
00:58:39,615 --> 00:58:41,815
What did she say?
- She's returning to India tomorrow.

651
00:58:42,117 --> 00:58:46,486
I want some important medicine from
the U.S. Could Jahnvi bring it?

652
00:58:50,792 --> 00:58:52,792
You ought to be happy
your daughter is returning.

653
00:58:53,128 --> 00:58:57,497
Jahnvi and Pooja keep no secrets.
She must surely know about Romi too.

654
00:58:58,133 --> 00:59:00,499
Jahnvi and Pooja are more like sisters.

655
00:59:00,802 --> 00:59:03,122
Even at home, no one has ever
discriminated between them.

656
00:59:03,305 --> 00:59:05,500
They've grown up together.

657
00:59:05,641 --> 00:59:08,508
Should Pooja have something,
Jahnvi too got it.

658
00:59:48,116 --> 00:59:50,550
Whenever the bangles tinkle...

659
00:59:53,488 --> 00:59:56,150
Whenever the anklets tinkle...

660
00:59:58,860 --> 01:00:01,556
Whenever it pours...

661
01:00:04,132 --> 01:00:07,829
My heart calls out.

662
01:00:09,504 --> 01:00:13,838
My love, Ô my beloved.

663
01:00:20,215 --> 01:00:24,584
Day in and day out, my heart calls out...

664
01:00:25,554 --> 01:00:29,991
My love, Ô my beloved.

665
01:00:36,098 --> 01:00:41,195
Why is there a pounding in my heart?
Why does it pine so?

666
01:00:41,369 --> 01:00:45,863
What have you done to my heart,
Ô heartless one?

667
01:01:39,494 --> 01:01:43,931
My sleep vanishes;
I'm restless.

668
01:01:44,599 --> 01:01:49,263
The things that loneliness does to me.

669
01:01:50,105 --> 01:01:51,936
My face is flushed of its color

670
01:01:52,607 --> 01:01:54,939
I lower my eyes out of shyness

671
01:01:55,544 --> 01:01:59,674
I feel shy, even when I look at the mirror.

672
01:02:01,650 --> 01:02:05,677
Why have you made me pine...?
Why have you taken away my peace?

673
01:02:49,030 --> 01:02:53,729
Whenever a boy meets a girl...

674
01:02:54,035 --> 01:02:58,734
it awakens a desire in my heart.

675
01:02:59,708 --> 01:03:03,735
When the bridal cymbals
are played somewhere.

676
01:03:04,679 --> 01:03:09,343
Whenever they deck up
the bridal palanquin...

677
01:03:11,319 --> 01:03:15,346
I go crazy at heart and yell out.

678
01:04:21,456 --> 01:04:23,822
Please come with me. I have
something to discuss with you.

679
01:04:26,461 --> 01:04:28,088
I'll be back soon.
- Okay, father.

680
01:04:51,486 --> 01:04:52,953
Can't you see where you're going?

681
01:05:05,500 --> 01:05:07,866
That's Jahnvi... my daughter.

682
01:05:11,172 --> 01:05:13,470
Why does it always happen to me?
- What happened?

683
01:05:14,175 --> 01:05:17,872
Nothing really... I thought
I'd run away from here.

684
01:05:18,513 --> 01:05:22,882
And I ran into my life...
must I run away now? Or mustn't I?

685
01:05:23,518 --> 01:05:26,885
No need to run away!
Jahnvi has never met Romi!

686
01:05:27,022 --> 01:05:28,887
She only spoke to him over the phone.

687
01:05:33,528 --> 01:05:35,894
Care for some tea?
- No thank you.

688
01:05:36,164 --> 01:05:39,895
No... don't cry, Biji.
You mustn't cry.

689
01:05:40,568 --> 01:05:42,126
Make her see reason, dad...

690
01:05:46,541 --> 01:05:49,510
We ought to be happy that
Pooja's life was saved.

691
01:05:49,711 --> 01:05:51,906
We were saved before something
drastic could happen.

692
01:05:52,547 --> 01:05:54,515
And what's so seriously wrong anyway?

693
01:05:54,616 --> 01:05:56,914
I spoke to the doctor before I arrived.

694
01:05:57,218 --> 01:05:59,778
Know something? This is exactly
what happened to Superman, too.

695
01:06:00,555 --> 01:06:03,524
Yes! And he's back to his
flying ways already.

696
01:06:03,725 --> 01:06:06,523
All Pooja now has to do
is to simply get up.

697
01:06:10,565 --> 01:06:12,533
We've taken enough of your drama, okay?

698
01:06:13,568 --> 01:06:16,537
Remember? You had planned a dance
competition for us, on my return?

699
01:06:16,871 --> 01:06:19,551
You were supposed to do an Indian
dance and I'd perform a Western.

700
01:06:19,574 --> 01:06:21,542
I've even learnt new steps!

701
01:06:24,579 --> 01:06:26,945
All right... now tell me
how's your married life?

702
01:06:28,583 --> 01:06:30,551
I've penned a couplet.
Want to hear it?

703
01:06:31,586 --> 01:06:38,549
I've filled up tubs with
my tears, as I remember you.

704
01:06:39,894 --> 01:06:42,954
The uncouth man that you are;
You simply bathe in it!

705
01:07:13,928 --> 01:07:16,988
What happened, dear?
- I ran into a madman out there.

706
01:07:17,632 --> 01:07:19,600
I went to wash the cold-drink
he spilled on me.

707
01:07:21,636 --> 01:07:23,604
You washed it with your tears, did you?

708
01:07:24,639 --> 01:07:28,006
God protect your friendship with her.

709
01:07:29,144 --> 01:07:31,009
Come, Jahnvi.
Let me introduce you to Romi.

710
01:07:31,646 --> 01:07:33,011
That's Romi.

711
01:07:34,182 --> 01:07:36,013
This is Jahnvi.

712
01:07:52,167 --> 01:07:54,635
And you said she hadn't ever met Romi!

713
01:07:55,670 --> 01:07:58,670
That's what I thought. That she had
only spoken to him over the telephone.

714
01:07:58,840 --> 01:08:02,037
Have you seen Romi?
- No.

715
01:08:02,177 --> 01:08:07,046
Pooja told me that he was short,
had brown eyes and curly hair.

716
01:08:07,682 --> 01:08:08,944
But this chap...

717
01:08:09,150 --> 01:08:10,710
In that case, you're not Jahnvi either.

718
01:08:11,686 --> 01:08:16,646
Pooja told me that Jahnvi's fat and ugly...

719
01:08:16,858 --> 01:08:19,986
that she's squint-eyed
and has a bucktooth.

720
01:08:20,328 --> 01:08:23,320
But all that is not true.
You're very beautiful.

721
01:08:24,199 --> 01:08:27,066
Get well, Pooja.
And I'll fix you!

722
01:08:28,770 --> 01:08:30,067
Tell him, Biji.

723
01:08:34,209 --> 01:08:38,077
It's Diwali today.
We won't be celebrating it...

724
01:08:38,713 --> 01:08:41,079
but we must have a prayer.

725
01:08:41,716 --> 01:08:44,082
We have to adhere to our customs.

726
01:08:44,719 --> 01:08:47,085
So come over to our place this evening.

727
01:08:47,222 --> 01:08:49,087
Okay?
- Certainly.

728
01:08:49,224 --> 01:08:51,089
It's your place too, son.

729
01:08:57,031 --> 01:09:00,091
Glory be to the Goddess of Wealth.

730
01:09:07,041 --> 01:09:14,106
The Gods too pay obeisance to You.

731
01:09:14,682 --> 01:09:16,707
Glory be to Thee.

732
01:09:18,753 --> 01:09:23,122
My husband got this bungalow built
when my son was just 15 years old.

733
01:09:27,562 --> 01:09:30,122
The prasad.
- You look beautiful.

734
01:09:31,766 --> 01:09:33,734
Know what Mrs. Godinho says?

735
01:09:34,168 --> 01:09:36,728
It's fun to celebrate
Diwali with your family.

736
01:09:41,776 --> 01:09:45,143
Take some prasad?
- It has 150 calories!

737
01:09:45,780 --> 01:09:50,149
I can't eat that!
- Go on. It's in the name of God.

738
01:09:52,086 --> 01:09:54,145
All right. I'll try some.

739
01:09:56,791 --> 01:09:58,759
You're calorie-conscious,
aren't you?

740
01:09:59,294 --> 01:10:01,159
No wonder you have such a great figure.

741
01:10:03,464 --> 01:10:05,762
Happy Diwali everybody!

742
01:10:06,100 --> 01:10:08,159
Please give me a smile!

743
01:10:08,703 --> 01:10:12,264
Welcome, Master. Let me introduce
you to my son-in-law.

744
01:10:13,808 --> 01:10:17,175
Your son-in-law?
- Yes. He's Pooja's husband, Romi.

745
01:10:17,812 --> 01:10:21,179
I've met him.
- Forget it.

746
01:10:21,482 --> 01:10:24,178
I have forgotten it.
Please remind me where.

747
01:10:24,819 --> 01:10:27,788
He's a singer. He's training
Pooja in classical dance.

748
01:10:27,989 --> 01:10:31,117
But he has this characteristic...
he's very absent-minded.

749
01:10:31,826 --> 01:10:34,795
So tell me where we have met
It'll refresh my memory.

750
01:10:35,263 --> 01:10:38,289
Must I? In everybody's presence?
- Sure! Go ahead.

751
01:10:38,833 --> 01:10:41,199
The Master and I participated
in a dance-contest.

752
01:10:41,836 --> 01:10:44,805
He danced so well that
he dropped his pants.

753
01:10:45,840 --> 01:10:48,809
Did that really happen?
- Yes... have you forgotten it?

754
01:10:49,143 --> 01:10:52,203
But you mustn't forget that
he's Pooja's husband, Romi.

755
01:10:53,348 --> 01:10:55,816
May I show Romi Pooja's room, dad?
- Certainly.

756
01:10:56,017 --> 01:10:58,815
Why just the room?
The house belongs to him... go on.

757
01:11:01,856 --> 01:11:04,222
This is Pooja's room.
- It's nice.

758
01:11:04,525 --> 01:11:07,221
And where's your room?
- This is the one.

759
01:11:07,362 --> 01:11:10,820
And which is Pooja's room?
- This is our room.

760
01:11:11,099 --> 01:11:13,226
Didn't Pooja tell you
that we share the room?

761
01:11:13,368 --> 01:11:14,835
She did. And I forgot.

762
01:11:16,871 --> 01:11:20,238
So many perfumes... but why have
two of each?

763
01:11:20,375 --> 01:11:25,244
That's because Pooja likes
whatever I like...

764
01:11:25,380 --> 01:11:28,247
and I also take a liking to
whatever Pooja approves of.

765
01:11:29,884 --> 01:11:33,251
Look at this... we even have
the same kind of cell-phones.

766
01:11:33,888 --> 01:11:35,253
Aren't they nice?

767
01:11:36,891 --> 01:11:40,258
But what happens if the two of you
fall for the same guy?

768
01:11:41,396 --> 01:11:43,261
That's impossible.
- Why?

769
01:11:43,564 --> 01:11:46,260
Because Pooja has already
approved of you, Romiji.

770
01:11:47,902 --> 01:11:51,269
Don't you approve of me then?
- Well, I do.

771
01:11:51,906 --> 01:11:54,272
But not in the same way.
- In what way, then?

772
01:11:57,412 --> 01:12:00,279
Pooja told me that you're good at poetry.

773
01:12:00,415 --> 01:12:03,282
So tell me the first couplet
you recited for Pooja.

774
01:12:17,432 --> 01:12:21,300
Everyone I come across...

775
01:12:21,436 --> 01:12:24,303
appears to be like you.

776
01:12:25,440 --> 01:12:32,312
Looks like I'm going to go mad...

777
01:12:32,447 --> 01:12:34,915
for, I'm in love with you...

778
01:12:35,249 --> 01:12:38,309
I wait for you.

779
01:12:42,623 --> 01:12:45,319
No wonder Pooja loves you so much, Romi ji.

780
01:13:54,095 --> 01:13:55,653
What the hell are you doing?!

781
01:13:56,330 --> 01:13:59,390
I didn't know your preferences
had changed so much in six years!

782
01:13:59,700 --> 01:14:04,000
Oh come on! I'm pretty hung up myself.
It's her I see every place.

783
01:14:04,205 --> 01:14:07,402
I find her in you, too.
- Really?... happens, I guess.

784
01:14:07,542 --> 01:14:09,407
Does it really?
- Of course.

785
01:14:09,544 --> 01:14:13,412
Lovers are like alcoholics.
They imagine the bottle everywhere.

786
01:14:13,548 --> 01:14:15,413
But spare me and let me go to sleep.

787
01:14:15,550 --> 01:14:18,018
I was dreaming about the milkmaid.

788
01:14:18,553 --> 01:14:20,418
Know what...?

789
01:14:21,055 --> 01:14:23,421
Will we only dream about girls?

790
01:14:23,558 --> 01:14:25,025
Get up.

791
01:15:01,095 --> 01:15:02,460
What's up with you?

792
01:15:04,098 --> 01:15:07,067
I've got your address
with great difficulty.

793
01:15:07,268 --> 01:15:10,465
What's so difficult?
This is an easy place to find.

794
01:15:10,605 --> 01:15:12,685
What would you like to drink?
Let me get something.

795
01:15:12,773 --> 01:15:14,070
Aba! Get up!
- Who's that?

796
01:15:14,275 --> 01:15:16,243
Me... Jahnvi's here.
How about some juices?

797
01:15:16,444 --> 01:15:17,411
Sorry! No juices!

798
01:15:18,613 --> 01:15:20,478
That's my friend, Aba.

799
01:15:21,115 --> 01:15:22,582
Greetings!

800
01:15:23,117 --> 01:15:25,085
And good-bye!
- Good-bye!

801
01:15:27,622 --> 01:15:31,490
Dad says you have fulfilled
his desire for a son.

802
01:15:32,793 --> 01:15:37,492
He has sent you this little gift.
- Oh yes. Small guitar indeed.

803
01:15:38,299 --> 01:15:40,494
What's in the guitar anyway?
- The car-keys.

804
01:15:42,136 --> 01:15:45,105
What car is it?
- An Opel. It's out there.

805
01:15:45,439 --> 01:15:48,272
Why's it out there?
- Because it can't be brought in.

806
01:15:51,646 --> 01:15:54,513
Dad has had the left-wing of
the bungalow vacated for you.

807
01:15:54,649 --> 01:15:56,116
You will live with us.

808
01:15:59,153 --> 01:16:02,122
He has given me status
with all this respect.

809
01:16:02,657 --> 01:16:06,457
On the other hand, he belittles me
by asking me to live with them.

810
01:16:08,329 --> 01:16:11,127
Thank Dad on my behalf.

811
01:16:12,166 --> 01:16:17,126
All I want is love. Your love.
And love from everyone else.

812
01:16:18,406 --> 01:16:21,807
Because there is nothing I can
give you, except for my love.

813
01:16:23,678 --> 01:16:25,543
Know what Mrs. Godinho
always says?

814
01:16:25,680 --> 01:16:30,140
Those who possess love are
never to be considered poor.

815
01:16:41,195 --> 01:16:43,163
How about some tea and buns?

816
01:16:44,198 --> 01:16:46,564
Abdul! At least send for
some tea and buns!

817
01:16:49,837 --> 01:16:51,566
Looks like you've won again.

818
01:16:55,209 --> 01:16:56,574
I've won again!

819
01:17:01,215 --> 01:17:03,183
Maybe you're lucky at both.

820
01:17:03,617 --> 01:17:06,586
Maybe you're beloved is very much
with you... and you don't know it.

821
01:17:08,222 --> 01:17:10,588
I don't understand.
- Let me explain.

822
01:17:11,225 --> 01:17:13,193
As Mrs. Godinho always says...

823
01:17:13,728 --> 01:17:15,593
God shows us the signal at every place...

824
01:17:15,730 --> 01:17:17,595
but it is we who can't understand.

825
01:17:17,732 --> 01:17:20,200
We meet so many people in our lifetime.

826
01:17:20,534 --> 01:17:22,593
But then, we come across an individual...

827
01:17:23,537 --> 01:17:25,368
whom we feel like meeting time and again.

828
01:17:25,573 --> 01:17:29,600
We are happy in his company.

829
01:17:30,244 --> 01:17:33,611
We are sad, when he goes away.

830
01:17:38,753 --> 01:17:42,211
That's the signal then.
One of us will have to leave...

831
01:17:43,257 --> 01:17:46,624
The two of you will leave.
I will stay back here. Okay?

832
01:17:47,261 --> 01:17:50,230
Let Romi stay back, father.
- No, dear. He's tired.

833
01:17:50,598 --> 01:17:54,625
He's tired... Go on.
- You ought to relax, sir.

834
01:17:54,769 --> 01:17:57,636
The two of us will spend
the night chatting away.
