1
00:02:08,921 --> 00:02:10,422
Girls, girls, girls.

2
00:02:10,631 --> 00:02:13,509
Mr. Sage, where do you find
all these beautiful girls?

3
00:02:13,675 --> 00:02:17,054
- You follow Mr. Ziegfeld sometime.
- I tried that once, but he lost me.

4
00:02:17,221 --> 00:02:20,599
- I almost forgot. Mr. Zieg...
- He's been trying to get me on the phone.

5
00:02:20,766 --> 00:02:23,435
What is it about a telephone
makes you want to answer it?

6
00:02:27,856 --> 00:02:30,108
- Good morning, Mr. Sage.
- Good morning, Mr. Sage.

7
00:02:30,275 --> 00:02:32,444
Mr. Ziegfeld's been calling you
all morning.

8
00:02:32,611 --> 00:02:34,530
What have I done
to Alexander Graham Bell?

9
00:02:34,696 --> 00:02:37,991
- I don't mind telegrams. They don't ring.
- Take off your hat and smile.

10
00:02:38,158 --> 00:02:40,661
I don't mind him calling.
That's why he underpays me.

11
00:02:40,827 --> 00:02:42,829
- Be here tomorrow at 11.
- But he calls me...

12
00:02:42,996 --> 00:02:46,458
...and gets me up at 2 in the morning
out of a sound sleep. I get insomnia.

13
00:02:46,667 --> 00:02:48,377
Take off your hat, smile winningly.

14
00:02:48,544 --> 00:02:51,171
- Mr. Slayton, Miss Sawyer.
- How do you do, Miss Sawyer?

15
00:02:51,338 --> 00:02:53,465
- How do?
- Take off your hat, smile winningly.

16
00:02:53,674 --> 00:02:55,342
Yes, sir.

17
00:02:56,510 --> 00:02:58,387
- Just my hat?
- Yes, just your hat.

18
00:02:58,554 --> 00:03:00,013
You think you're picking them.

19
00:03:00,180 --> 00:03:02,933
The boss is on one of the greatest
voyages of discovery...

20
00:03:03,100 --> 00:03:05,018
...since the days of Americus Vespucci.

21
00:03:05,185 --> 00:03:08,063
He found one on a Staten Island Ferry,
one on the Bronx Express...

22
00:03:08,230 --> 00:03:11,275
...two in an all-night laundry.
- Fine. Be here tomorrow at 11.

23
00:03:11,441 --> 00:03:14,736
Oh, well, don't you want to see
my legs?

24
00:03:14,903 --> 00:03:17,573
That's not our department, honey.

25
00:03:17,739 --> 00:03:20,993
- Did you call me "honey"?
- He calls everybody honey.

26
00:03:21,201 --> 00:03:24,621
- What's biting you, honey?
- Now you're doing it too!

27
00:03:24,788 --> 00:03:25,998
I've been warned.

28
00:03:26,206 --> 00:03:28,959
Look, kid, the Follies are life,
and life is a cafeteria.

29
00:03:29,126 --> 00:03:33,088
You look at the pretty dishes, pick out
what you want, but you've got to pay for it.

30
00:03:33,255 --> 00:03:37,509
There are signs up all over the place,
"Not responsible for valuables."

31
00:03:37,676 --> 00:03:39,678
Get it, honey?

32
00:03:39,845 --> 00:03:41,763
Yes. Yes, I do.

33
00:03:41,930 --> 00:03:44,099
Are you sure you know
what we're driving at?

34
00:03:44,266 --> 00:03:46,393
- It's kind of subtle.
- Yes.

35
00:03:46,560 --> 00:03:49,646
Keep on saying that
and see where it gets you.

36
00:03:52,983 --> 00:03:55,068
Hello? Yes, Mr. Ziegfeld.

37
00:03:55,235 --> 00:03:57,738
It's for you, Mr. Sage.

38
00:03:57,905 --> 00:03:59,531
I'll be there in 20 minutes.

39
00:03:59,740 --> 00:04:02,242
Where are you?
Yes, Mr. Ziegfeld.

40
00:04:07,247 --> 00:04:10,542
- Suits and furs.
- Second floor, first elevator.

41
00:04:11,168 --> 00:04:13,921
So he looks me over,
and when he gets to my feet, he says:

42
00:04:14,087 --> 00:04:16,381
"You'll do,
and I like my ankles slim too."

43
00:04:16,548 --> 00:04:20,719
- Yeah, and how'd you come back?
- Hard. I said, "How do you like your heels?"

44
00:04:20,928 --> 00:04:24,389
- Gee, that's terrific.
- Yeah. He said he was Florenz Ziegfeld.

45
00:04:24,598 --> 00:04:26,099
What a nerve!

46
00:04:26,850 --> 00:04:29,895
When you're quite ready, miss.

47
00:04:30,604 --> 00:04:31,897
Hey, wait for papa!

48
00:04:35,651 --> 00:04:38,987
- Surprised to see me, Red?
- Gosh, what if it was Ziegfeld?

49
00:04:39,154 --> 00:04:40,405
Mezzanine.

50
00:04:40,572 --> 00:04:42,741
- Stationery?
- Two on the aisle.

51
00:04:42,908 --> 00:04:45,994
I mean, two aisles over.

52
00:04:48,121 --> 00:04:51,166
If this happens, it's the biggest thing
that ever happened to us.

53
00:04:51,959 --> 00:04:57,047
- Second floor. Coats, furs, Paris gowns.
- Second? Thank you.

54
00:05:04,763 --> 00:05:08,308
- Gil, stop. Listen...
- Okay, okay.

55
00:05:08,475 --> 00:05:09,977
There, we're stopped.

56
00:05:10,143 --> 00:05:14,231
Baby, I'm practically a success.
The boss says to me today, he says:

57
00:05:14,398 --> 00:05:17,317
- "I've been watching..."
- Why shouldn't he pick me out?

58
00:05:18,360 --> 00:05:21,071
What? Anyways, he says,
"I've been watching you.

59
00:05:21,238 --> 00:05:24,283
You're slated for a job that's twice as good
as the one you work."

60
00:05:24,449 --> 00:05:25,659
And I says, "Twice?"

61
00:05:25,826 --> 00:05:30,455
He says, "Next week, you go from
the 21/2-ton trucks to the 5-ton trucks."

62
00:05:30,664 --> 00:05:32,499
- Oh, that's great, Gil.
- Then he says...

63
00:05:32,666 --> 00:05:35,335
Listen, a man came in here
a little while ago...

64
00:05:35,502 --> 00:05:37,171
...and said he was Florenz Ziegfeld.

65
00:05:37,337 --> 00:05:41,049
Well, I thought he was just being fresh,
so I was fresh right back.

66
00:05:41,216 --> 00:05:43,886
Well, now, honey, what would he
be doing in an elevator?

67
00:05:44,052 --> 00:05:45,262
I don't know.

68
00:05:45,429 --> 00:05:47,764
Maybe going up and down
in here got you dizzy, huh?

69
00:05:47,931 --> 00:05:49,016
Why?

70
00:05:49,183 --> 00:05:53,353
If a girl gets into the Ziegfeld Follies,
she's made.

71
00:05:54,730 --> 00:05:57,065
Oh, Gil, I'm sorry.

72
00:05:57,232 --> 00:06:00,611
- I think it's swell about the truck.
- Yeah, yeah.

73
00:06:09,369 --> 00:06:12,873
Wouldn't you think I'd get used
to going down in this elevator?

74
00:06:13,040 --> 00:06:15,167
But when you kiss me...

75
00:06:15,375 --> 00:06:19,046
No kidding? You feel like
you're going down in an elevator?

76
00:06:19,213 --> 00:06:21,590
How do you feel when I kiss you?

77
00:06:21,757 --> 00:06:24,718
Feel like I'm going up in an elevator.

78
00:06:35,145 --> 00:06:38,524
- What's the matter, stuck?
- Yeah, and we like it.

79
00:06:38,690 --> 00:06:42,778
Miss Regan, come with me, please.
Take the car.

80
00:06:44,571 --> 00:06:47,282
This gentleman wants to speak to you.
Miss Regan, Mr. Sage.

81
00:06:47,449 --> 00:06:51,119
- Hey, that wasn't her fault back there.
- You're a very lucky girl, my dear.

82
00:06:51,286 --> 00:06:55,123
- What's your full name, Miss Regan?
- Sheila Regan. That full enough?

83
00:06:55,290 --> 00:06:57,751
Too full for Mr. Ziegfeld,
but he can change it.

84
00:06:58,001 --> 00:06:59,920
Where do you live?

85
00:07:00,087 --> 00:07:02,506
Brace yourself, pal. Brooklyn.

86
00:07:04,091 --> 00:07:06,385
What is your phone number?

87
00:07:06,552 --> 00:07:08,303
Flatbush 7098.

88
00:07:08,470 --> 00:07:10,973
I suppose Mr. Ziegfeld
can change that too, huh?

89
00:07:11,139 --> 00:07:14,852
- Yes, to Butterfield, pal.
- Oh, now, wait!

90
00:07:15,018 --> 00:07:19,731
You will be at Mr. Ziegfeld's office
tomorrow morning at 11:00.

91
00:07:21,400 --> 00:07:23,735
Nod once if you've heard me.

92
00:07:23,944 --> 00:07:27,197
Very lucky girl, my dear.

93
00:07:35,455 --> 00:07:38,083
Hey, what's the matter?

94
00:07:38,834 --> 00:07:42,754
Well, tomorrow morning at 11:00...

95
00:07:42,921 --> 00:07:45,465
...l'm a Ziegfeld girl.

96
00:07:45,632 --> 00:07:48,343
Just like that.

97
00:07:48,844 --> 00:07:51,346
Hey! Order me three of these
in different colors.

98
00:07:51,513 --> 00:07:53,182
They don't come in different colors.

99
00:07:53,348 --> 00:07:55,559
Think the leopard will change
its spots for you?

100
00:07:55,726 --> 00:07:57,436
What else?

101
00:07:57,644 --> 00:08:00,856
Well, Gil, how do I look?

102
00:08:02,191 --> 00:08:06,612
You look all right, Red.
Don't sound so good.

103
00:08:20,501 --> 00:08:22,085
Thank you.

104
00:08:22,252 --> 00:08:24,963
Yes, Mr. Ziegfeld.

105
00:08:25,130 --> 00:08:27,716
Miss Gallagher of Ed Gallagher
and Company?

106
00:08:27,883 --> 00:08:29,134
That's me!

107
00:08:29,301 --> 00:08:32,513
Mr. Ziegfeld will try to see
your act tonight.

108
00:08:32,679 --> 00:08:34,473
He'll try.

109
00:08:36,183 --> 00:08:39,019
You'd think he had to fight his way
into the theater.

110
00:08:39,186 --> 00:08:41,522
It'll take a miracle
to make him catch our act.

111
00:08:41,688 --> 00:08:44,191
This is the place they dish
those miracles out, honey.

112
00:08:44,358 --> 00:08:46,527
They ran a fresh one up for me.

113
00:08:46,693 --> 00:08:47,945
Mind if I touch you?

114
00:08:48,111 --> 00:08:51,323
Maybe those miracles
are catching, like measles.

115
00:08:51,532 --> 00:08:53,325
- Oh, Miss Gallagher?
- What?

116
00:08:53,617 --> 00:08:56,954
Mr. Ziegfeld wants to know
where you're playing tonight.

117
00:08:57,120 --> 00:08:59,790
Oh, the...

118
00:09:00,374 --> 00:09:02,042
...Harlem Opera House.

119
00:10:52,569 --> 00:10:56,198
Well, I'll give that Ziegfeld bird
just five minutes to get here.

120
00:10:56,365 --> 00:10:59,701
- lf he doesn't show, he's lost me.
- Pop, give him a few minutes longer.

121
00:10:59,868 --> 00:11:04,581
Not a second. When he gets here,
that's our cue to be hard to get.

122
00:11:04,748 --> 00:11:08,001
- Right now, I feel awful easy to get.
- Don't ever be.

123
00:11:08,168 --> 00:11:10,879
You got everything your mother had,
and she was bigtime...

124
00:11:11,046 --> 00:11:13,298
...after I ironed out the kinks
in her technique.

125
00:11:13,465 --> 00:11:15,300
Gosh, I hope he liked our act.

126
00:11:15,467 --> 00:11:19,304
I'm getting so tired of tank towns
and trained seals.

127
00:11:19,471 --> 00:11:21,557
For you and me both.

128
00:11:21,723 --> 00:11:25,185
Not that I haven't known some
very charming seals, but...

129
00:11:25,352 --> 00:11:29,690
- It's him! That's him.
- He just got in under the wire.

130
00:11:34,111 --> 00:11:36,864
Won't you come in?

131
00:11:38,031 --> 00:11:39,658
You're Ed Gallagher and Company?

132
00:11:39,867 --> 00:11:42,578
In the flesh, my man.
As big as life and twice as natural.

133
00:11:42,744 --> 00:11:45,539
I'm Noble Sage,
Mr. Ziegfeld's strong right arm.

134
00:11:45,706 --> 00:11:48,292
Oh, come on in, come on in.

135
00:11:48,458 --> 00:11:50,127
Here, have a chair.

136
00:11:50,294 --> 00:11:53,046
Thanks. I've got one.

137
00:11:53,213 --> 00:11:55,632
Mr. Ziegfeld saw
your performance tonight.

138
00:11:55,799 --> 00:11:58,135
Did he like it?
Did he say he liked it?

139
00:11:58,302 --> 00:11:59,511
How is Ziggy?

140
00:11:59,720 --> 00:12:03,473
- You know Mr. Ziegfeld?
- No. He never had the pleasure.

141
00:12:04,308 --> 00:12:07,978
You're very lucky. Mr. Ziegfeld would
like to see you in his office tomorrow.

142
00:12:08,145 --> 00:12:09,938
Right! What time?

143
00:12:10,105 --> 00:12:12,900
- How about 11:00?
- Right.

144
00:12:13,066 --> 00:12:16,403
- That's the New Amsterdam Theatre.
- Right.

145
00:12:16,570 --> 00:12:18,197
- 42nd Street.
- Right.

146
00:12:18,363 --> 00:12:22,451
And say, tell Ziggy he's getting
the best act in vaudeville.

147
00:12:22,618 --> 00:12:25,204
- Who should know better than me?
- Oh, Mr. Gallagher...

148
00:12:25,370 --> 00:12:30,417
...Mr. Ziegfeld isn't interested in the act,
only your daughter.

149
00:12:36,548 --> 00:12:38,926
- Right.
- No, wrong.

150
00:12:39,092 --> 00:12:42,137
I won't be there at 11:00,
Mr. Sage, or ever.

151
00:12:42,304 --> 00:12:44,598
I couldn't. Not without my father.

152
00:12:44,765 --> 00:12:47,351
Why, without him, I'm nothing at all.

153
00:12:47,518 --> 00:12:51,647
If Mr. Ziegfeld can't understand that,
how could I work for him?

154
00:12:52,272 --> 00:12:54,483
I couldn't respect him.

155
00:12:55,359 --> 00:13:00,030
No. Tell him thanks very much,
but I can't accept.

156
00:13:00,197 --> 00:13:04,201
Susie. I said, right.
I mean right, Mr. Sage.

157
00:13:04,368 --> 00:13:06,370
My kid will be there.

158
00:13:06,537 --> 00:13:07,829
Right.

159
00:13:07,996 --> 00:13:10,499
And tell Ziggy he's getting a break
he don't deserve.

160
00:13:10,666 --> 00:13:14,127
I'll be right behind her showing her how
every step of the way.

161
00:13:14,294 --> 00:13:16,171
Right!

162
00:13:21,301 --> 00:13:22,594
Oh, Pop.

163
00:13:22,761 --> 00:13:25,681
Don't worry, baby.
You'll be all right.

164
00:13:25,848 --> 00:13:30,936
Our act's like a snake. You cut it
in half and both ends wiggle.

165
00:13:32,437 --> 00:13:33,689
Chin up, shoulders relaxed...

166
00:13:33,981 --> 00:13:37,901
...and don't forget to smile.

167
00:13:48,370 --> 00:13:50,414
I'm so sorry.

168
00:13:50,581 --> 00:13:52,249
Oh, I'm sorry.

169
00:13:52,416 --> 00:13:55,502
Hey, hey, hey!
Come up out of that hole, baby.

170
00:13:55,669 --> 00:13:59,339
- You're not a showgirl.
- I'm sorry.

171
00:14:15,689 --> 00:14:17,733
Good thing you outgrew
those knock-knees.

172
00:14:17,900 --> 00:14:19,735
Jerry!

173
00:14:19,902 --> 00:14:22,154
I hate to admit it,
but this is my kid brother.

174
00:14:22,362 --> 00:14:25,032
- Jerry, this is Susan Gallagher.
- Hello.

175
00:14:25,199 --> 00:14:27,034
Hiya, Susie.

176
00:14:27,201 --> 00:14:29,494
Pony-size, huh?

177
00:14:29,703 --> 00:14:32,289
Ma made you lunch.
Says you got to keep up your strength.

178
00:14:32,456 --> 00:14:35,000
You'll need it to fight off
those stagedoor Johnnies.

179
00:14:35,209 --> 00:14:36,668
What do you know about them?

180
00:14:36,877 --> 00:14:39,505
I was born in a theatrical trunk,
but the lid wasn't shut.

181
00:14:39,713 --> 00:14:41,673
I think my pop left it open on purpose.

182
00:14:41,840 --> 00:14:45,052
He says it's what you don't know
that can hurt you.

183
00:14:45,219 --> 00:14:48,138
Now, what could you learn
out of a book?

184
00:14:50,140 --> 00:14:51,934
- Hiya, John.
- Hello, honey.

185
00:14:52,142 --> 00:14:54,853
That's Frank Merton.
He's one of the stars of the show.

186
00:14:55,020 --> 00:14:58,982
- He's got the most beautiful voice.
- Yeah?

187
00:14:59,191 --> 00:15:01,026
Cucaracha. Look at that one.

188
00:15:01,235 --> 00:15:04,821
She looks better all wrapped up
than the rest of them do unwrapped.

189
00:15:04,988 --> 00:15:08,408
Auditions. All ready for the auditions.

190
00:15:11,787 --> 00:15:16,250
Don't be so nervous, darling.
All the conductor can say is yes or no.

191
00:15:16,416 --> 00:15:19,002
But he can also say,
"Who let you in here?"

192
00:15:19,169 --> 00:15:21,839
Musical director is ready
to hear you, Mr. Kolter.

193
00:15:22,005 --> 00:15:25,133
No, Franz. The job
isn't good enough for you.

194
00:15:25,300 --> 00:15:30,764
I ask you, can such an artist as you
play second fiddle in a Ziegfeld orchestra?

195
00:15:30,931 --> 00:15:32,558
- Yes.
- Yes.

196
00:15:32,724 --> 00:15:37,729
No. It's a disgrace to your violin
to make jazz music.

197
00:15:37,896 --> 00:15:40,482
- Where is your violin?
- Well...

198
00:15:40,649 --> 00:15:44,236
...the pawnbroker is holding it for ransom.

199
00:15:44,444 --> 00:15:46,822
It was a question of food or music.

200
00:15:46,989 --> 00:15:51,535
Franz was too hungry to play,
and I was too hungry to listen.

201
00:15:52,244 --> 00:15:57,124
- All right. Use mine.
- All right, Mr. Kolter.

202
00:15:57,583 --> 00:15:59,877
Wear this for luck, darling.

203
00:16:00,043 --> 00:16:03,547
How can the heart be so full
when the stomach is so empty?

204
00:16:03,714 --> 00:16:06,425
I don't understand it.

205
00:16:11,096 --> 00:16:13,265
- What are you waiting for?
- I'm sorry, girls...

206
00:16:13,473 --> 00:16:17,311
Oh, Sage, come here.
You want credit for a great discovery?

207
00:16:17,477 --> 00:16:19,813
What is the matter?
What's the matter?

208
00:16:19,980 --> 00:16:21,857
Mr. Zieg...

209
00:16:22,024 --> 00:16:26,945
- Well! Well, what are you doing here?
- Why, I'm just waiting...

210
00:16:27,112 --> 00:16:29,364
You're waiting?
You mean Mr. Ziegfeld's waiting!

211
00:16:29,531 --> 00:16:33,118
- Oh, but I can't...
- Well, well, well!

212
00:16:39,166 --> 00:16:41,668
- Darling.
- Sandra, where did you go?

213
00:16:41,835 --> 00:16:47,424
I was so worried, I didn't even realize
Mischa was lending me a dollar for dinner.

214
00:16:47,591 --> 00:16:49,092
Well?

215
00:16:49,301 --> 00:16:52,429
- I didn't get the job.
- I'm glad you didn't. Mischa was right.

216
00:16:52,596 --> 00:16:55,516
- The job wasn't good enough for you.
- So the conductor thought.

217
00:16:55,682 --> 00:16:58,477
Oh, he was very kind.
He said I belong in Carnegie Hall.

218
00:16:58,685 --> 00:17:01,188
I play well, he said.
I play too well.

219
00:17:01,355 --> 00:17:04,399
I am a classicist, he said.

220
00:17:05,192 --> 00:17:08,403
That's like being dead and buried,
but with your feet sticking out.

221
00:17:08,570 --> 00:17:11,281
Oh, but we're not dead yet. Look!

222
00:17:11,573 --> 00:17:14,243
But, Sandra,
where did you get this money?

223
00:17:14,409 --> 00:17:16,870
An advance. I have a job.

224
00:17:17,037 --> 00:17:19,623
I'm going to be a showgirl
in the Follies.

225
00:17:19,790 --> 00:17:23,001
The Follies? A showgirl?

226
00:17:23,877 --> 00:17:27,840
It is a little silly. You just
put on some beads or something...

227
00:17:28,006 --> 00:17:29,716
...and walk up and down.

228
00:17:29,883 --> 00:17:32,886
Like this. See?

229
00:17:33,053 --> 00:17:34,304
Now.

230
00:17:35,472 --> 00:17:37,558
That's all. Just like that.

231
00:17:37,724 --> 00:17:39,852
And people pay money
to look at you.

232
00:17:40,060 --> 00:17:42,521
- How did all this happen?
- Well...

233
00:17:42,729 --> 00:17:45,107
...I was standing there,
listening to you play, and...

234
00:17:45,274 --> 00:17:47,526
Oh, darling, you played beautifully.

235
00:17:47,734 --> 00:17:49,570
When a funny little man...

236
00:17:49,736 --> 00:17:52,030
The one I saw didn't look
so funny or so little.

237
00:17:52,239 --> 00:17:54,950
Oh, not that one. There were two.
They were both funny...

238
00:17:55,117 --> 00:17:57,494
...but the funniest one
pushed me through a door...

239
00:17:57,661 --> 00:18:01,456
...and there I was
in a room filled with flowers...

240
00:18:01,623 --> 00:18:03,250
...and deep carpet...

241
00:18:04,126 --> 00:18:06,086
...and...

242
00:18:06,253 --> 00:18:09,715
And then I heard a voice
from behind the flowers saying:

243
00:18:09,923 --> 00:18:14,052
"Figure, okay. Face, okay. Smile, okay.
Seventy-five a week." Next.

244
00:18:14,261 --> 00:18:15,804
Next?

245
00:18:15,971 --> 00:18:18,432
- What's next?
- Well...

246
00:18:18,599 --> 00:18:20,475
...next you congratulate me.

247
00:18:21,852 --> 00:18:25,189
I should congratulate myself.
My wife has a job.

248
00:18:25,939 --> 00:18:27,691
Franz, you're ridiculous.

249
00:18:27,858 --> 00:18:32,070
- All failures are ridiculous.
- But, darling, you're not a failure.

250
00:18:32,237 --> 00:18:34,364
No?

251
00:18:35,908 --> 00:18:41,079
Well, what is it you want me to do,
give up the job?

252
00:18:43,498 --> 00:18:48,295
I know it's a rather foolish way
to earn money, but, Franz, we need it!

253
00:18:48,587 --> 00:18:52,966
Do you really imagine I would stand by
while you showed yourself to other men?

254
00:18:53,383 --> 00:18:55,969
Why, Franz...

255
00:18:57,804 --> 00:19:00,307
...you're jealous.
- Jealous?

256
00:19:00,474 --> 00:19:04,645
Don't you think I see the men who look
at you when you pass them on the street?

257
00:19:04,811 --> 00:19:08,106
Do you think I'm jealous
of them? No.

258
00:19:08,315 --> 00:19:09,983
I'm afraid.

259
00:19:10,150 --> 00:19:13,320
That's not fear.
That's distrust of me.

260
00:19:13,487 --> 00:19:17,282
If I weren't always beside you,
sooner or later, they wouldn't pass you by.

261
00:19:17,449 --> 00:19:22,120
They would stop. They would talk to you.
They would go your way.

262
00:19:23,080 --> 00:19:26,708
They could stop and talk to me,
they could even go my way...

263
00:19:26,875 --> 00:19:29,503
...but, darling,
it still would be my way.

264
00:19:29,670 --> 00:19:32,965
I know. Pretty soon,
it will be their way.

265
00:19:36,844 --> 00:19:40,639
So we never really had the thing
I thought we had...

266
00:19:41,098 --> 00:19:43,517
...faith in each other.

267
00:19:43,684 --> 00:19:46,478
If you have that,
you don't mind about the other things.

268
00:19:46,687 --> 00:19:49,648
You don't even know
you haven't got them.

269
00:19:49,815 --> 00:19:52,484
All of a sudden,
I realize we haven't got them.

270
00:19:52,693 --> 00:19:56,321
All right! Take the job!
Be a showgirl!

271
00:19:56,530 --> 00:19:58,448
But, Franz...

272
00:19:59,575 --> 00:20:04,538
It's one or the other, Sandra.
Me or the job.

273
00:20:23,807 --> 00:20:25,017
Nervous?

274
00:20:25,225 --> 00:20:27,686
Oh, Jenny, I can't even
put on my lipstick.

275
00:20:27,895 --> 00:20:31,940
Relax, honey.
They won't be looking at your mouth.

276
00:20:36,403 --> 00:20:37,654
- Well!
- I'm sorry.

277
00:20:37,821 --> 00:20:39,406
I've been peeking at the audience.

278
00:20:39,573 --> 00:20:43,202
The women look like Christmas trees,
and the men look like penguins.

279
00:20:44,244 --> 00:20:46,997
Why should you be worried, baby?
You're an old performer.

280
00:20:47,164 --> 00:20:50,334
At the Harlem Opera House, I had
four chances a day to make them like me.

281
00:20:50,501 --> 00:20:52,377
- Here, it's once and out.
- Nothing to it.

282
00:20:52,544 --> 00:20:55,589
It's walking down stairs
like you never had to climb them again.

283
00:20:55,756 --> 00:20:59,343
Take lots of time walking down,
and you'll gather plenty of moss.

284
00:20:59,593 --> 00:21:00,969
Coming in, girls!

285
00:21:01,136 --> 00:21:04,515
Let me fix that, Flatbush!
You'll have it looking like an ice pack.

286
00:21:04,681 --> 00:21:08,602
- Having trouble, Flatbush?
- Only above the neck.

287
00:21:08,769 --> 00:21:10,687
Listen, kids!

288
00:21:10,854 --> 00:21:14,024
I've got something important
to say to you.

289
00:21:14,733 --> 00:21:19,112
Except for a couple of hardened veterans,
you're all new to the big time.

290
00:21:19,279 --> 00:21:22,324
In a few minutes, you're going on
in your first number.

291
00:21:22,491 --> 00:21:26,662
Do you know what that means?
It means you're Ziegfeld girls.

292
00:21:26,828 --> 00:21:29,540
You're going to have
all the opportunities of a lifetime...

293
00:21:29,706 --> 00:21:33,919
...crowded into a couple of hours.
And all the temptations.

294
00:21:34,086 --> 00:21:37,756
Some of you are gonna wind up
with your names in electric lights.

295
00:21:38,131 --> 00:21:41,426
Some of you are gonna wind up
with a husband and kids.

296
00:21:41,593 --> 00:21:44,471
And some of you
are gonna wind up...

297
00:21:44,638 --> 00:21:45,973
Well, not so good.

298
00:21:46,139 --> 00:21:49,768
I know what I'm talking about
because I've seen all three happen.

299
00:21:49,977 --> 00:21:51,937
Whatever it is,
don't blame the Follies...

300
00:21:52,145 --> 00:21:56,567
...because it would've happened even if you
were still where Mr. Ziegfeld found you.

301
00:21:56,775 --> 00:21:59,361
It just might have taken a little longer.

302
00:21:59,528 --> 00:22:03,407
So remember this, kids,
and it comes straight from Mr. Ziegfeld:

303
00:22:03,574 --> 00:22:08,370
"The Follies is life in one stiff jolt,
life running instead of walking...

304
00:22:08,537 --> 00:22:10,873
...life speeded up to a mile a minute.

305
00:22:11,039 --> 00:22:15,210
But if you've got the right stuff,
the pace won't bother you.

306
00:22:17,963 --> 00:22:20,924
And if you haven't,
you'll come a cropper.

307
00:22:22,009 --> 00:22:24,928
It's strictly up to you."

308
00:22:28,473 --> 00:22:30,434
Dream number.
Places for the dream number.

309
00:22:30,601 --> 00:22:32,853
All right, girls!

310
00:22:34,021 --> 00:22:35,731
And good luck.

311
00:29:07,414 --> 00:29:10,167
So you like paprika too, eh, Geoffrey?

312
00:29:10,334 --> 00:29:11,710
That's Sheila Hale.

313
00:29:11,877 --> 00:29:13,712
Want to meet the young lady,
as it were?

314
00:29:13,879 --> 00:29:16,048
She'll be met.

315
00:29:20,928 --> 00:29:24,473
Well, my little brood,
we're up to your hips in a terrific hit.

316
00:29:24,932 --> 00:29:28,143
Oh, Susie, run out and rescue the actors
from your old man, will you?

317
00:29:28,310 --> 00:29:31,939
He's trying to explain to our comics
how they should have put over their stuff.

318
00:29:32,105 --> 00:29:34,733
If they listen to Pop, they're in.

319
00:29:35,734 --> 00:29:36,944
- Hello.
- Oh, hello.

320
00:29:37,110 --> 00:29:39,780
- We're stepping out and high!
- Really? Did Pop say so?

321
00:29:39,947 --> 00:29:42,032
Well, he's going along.

322
00:29:42,199 --> 00:29:44,451
- Name your poison.
- How about an ice-cream soda?

323
00:29:44,618 --> 00:29:46,411
Oh, big shot!

324
00:29:46,912 --> 00:29:50,916
- All right, all right, cut me down.
- Oh, don't be silly. Come on.

325
00:29:51,124 --> 00:29:56,213
Girls, the boss is throwing a big
coming-out party tonight for one and all.

326
00:29:56,380 --> 00:29:58,715
- I know we can count on you.
- Oh, yes.

327
00:29:58,882 --> 00:30:01,927
Will you be there, lovely?
Will you be there!

328
00:30:03,136 --> 00:30:04,930
Frank is waiting for you.

329
00:30:05,138 --> 00:30:07,975
When that canary holds out his hand,
there's something in it.

330
00:30:08,141 --> 00:30:09,518
How about you, Flatbush?

331
00:30:09,685 --> 00:30:14,189
No, no. My boyfriend's waiting outside,
with a 21/2-ton truck.

332
00:30:14,439 --> 00:30:17,025
Well, maybe even a 5-ton job,
if I'm lucky.

333
00:30:17,192 --> 00:30:19,903
You've got the right angle, honey.
You marry for love.

334
00:30:20,070 --> 00:30:22,281
- I did.
- All five times.

335
00:30:22,489 --> 00:30:26,159
- And you still have another arm.
- Yeah, and I wish I was an octopus.

336
00:30:26,326 --> 00:30:28,620
You are.

337
00:30:29,913 --> 00:30:32,833
Slip me that handcuff, will you, honey?
The big one.

338
00:30:37,296 --> 00:30:39,631
For you, Flatbush.

339
00:30:39,798 --> 00:30:41,758
For me?

340
00:30:45,345 --> 00:30:48,599
- Who's Geoffrey Collis?
- A patron of the arts, my dear...

341
00:30:48,765 --> 00:30:51,643
...and a guy with more potatoes
than they grow in Idaho.

342
00:30:51,852 --> 00:30:54,313
Good hunting, kid. Only...

343
00:30:54,479 --> 00:30:59,151
...don't shoot until you see the whites
of the eyes on those potatoes.

344
00:31:06,700 --> 00:31:09,703
Here's one, Pa,
and about time. Listen.

345
00:31:09,870 --> 00:31:12,956
"Another new glorified girl
who made an impression was Sheila Hale.

346
00:31:13,123 --> 00:31:16,835
This one used to run an elevator.
Confidentially, boys, she gave me a lift."

347
00:31:17,002 --> 00:31:18,212
Sheila Hale.

348
00:31:18,378 --> 00:31:21,089
How can I brag to the boys
when they know my name is Regan?

349
00:31:21,256 --> 00:31:24,176
Well, maybe we could
change our name to Hale.

350
00:31:24,343 --> 00:31:27,513
Ma! Pa! She's up. Sheila's up.

351
00:31:27,721 --> 00:31:29,723
I fed her some grapefruit juice.

352
00:31:29,890 --> 00:31:34,061
Gee, Ma, you should have seen her
come down them steps. Like this.

353
00:31:35,437 --> 00:31:38,899
Well! I hope I didn't raise my boy
to be a Ziegfeld girl.

354
00:31:39,066 --> 00:31:41,818
You should have heard the tune
they played. Special for her.

355
00:31:41,985 --> 00:31:43,862
Here it is. Listen.

356
00:32:14,601 --> 00:32:16,895
I'm as proud of you
as I am of me uniform.

357
00:32:17,062 --> 00:32:18,856
Well, you can put it away
in mothballs.

358
00:32:19,022 --> 00:32:21,650
From now on,
we're gonna have lots of...

359
00:32:21,817 --> 00:32:23,527
...potatoes.
- Irish potatoes?

360
00:32:23,694 --> 00:32:27,281
Sure. Only kind I'd eat if I could eat any.
Mr. Ziegfeld's put me on a diet.

361
00:32:27,447 --> 00:32:29,867
- Fine, if it's for building you up.
- Tearing me down.

362
00:32:30,033 --> 00:32:32,411
He says if I don't watch my figure,
nobody else will.

363
00:32:32,619 --> 00:32:35,747
Sheila, look at me being an actress!

364
00:32:36,915 --> 00:32:40,252
Would you walk me to the corner,
Mrs. Bernhardt?

365
00:32:41,336 --> 00:32:43,422
You're gonna put away
some bacon and eggs.

366
00:32:43,630 --> 00:32:45,757
And you can tell that Mr. Ziegfeld
I said so.

367
00:32:45,966 --> 00:32:47,759
Diet!

368
00:33:11,158 --> 00:33:12,993
Showgirls should be seen and not heard.

369
00:33:13,160 --> 00:33:15,287
You'll pull in your ears
when you read my notices.

370
00:33:15,454 --> 00:33:18,790
I pulled them in when I heard you
singing. Look, look. Look at this.

371
00:33:18,999 --> 00:33:20,083
There she is.

372
00:33:20,250 --> 00:33:25,255
- Gil, you've got it. You got your truck.
- Yeah. Five tons if she's an ounce.

373
00:33:25,422 --> 00:33:27,132
- Did you get the raise?
- No.

374
00:33:27,299 --> 00:33:29,635
No, but I got twice as much
responsibility there.

375
00:33:29,801 --> 00:33:32,471
Twice as much weight to carry
around for the same paycheck.

376
00:33:32,679 --> 00:33:36,475
- Look, Red, we got things to talk about.
- Gil, don't I look different this morning?

377
00:33:36,683 --> 00:33:37,768
I feel different.

378
00:33:37,935 --> 00:33:42,147
You never look different to me. A diamond
don't have to be in no Tiffany setting...

379
00:33:42,356 --> 00:33:44,358
...before I can see it.
- Meaning who?

380
00:33:44,525 --> 00:33:47,361
I mean those guys that hang
around down by the stage door.

381
00:33:47,528 --> 00:33:51,365
The ones with the moneybags under their
eyes. I saw them looking at you last night.

382
00:33:51,532 --> 00:33:52,908
How, Gil?

383
00:33:53,075 --> 00:33:54,576
How did they look?

384
00:33:54,743 --> 00:33:58,455
Well, in such a way as to give me an awful
good excuse to punch them in the jaw.

385
00:33:58,622 --> 00:34:02,042
Here. Yeah, here's a little item
you dropped.

386
00:34:02,209 --> 00:34:06,880
That's "I like you very much.
Call me sometime. Geoffrey Collis."

387
00:34:07,047 --> 00:34:09,550
Hey, where does he get off,
asking you to call him?

388
00:34:09,716 --> 00:34:12,553
A gent never forces himself on a lady.

389
00:34:12,719 --> 00:34:14,721
Oh, Gil, what are you so sore about?

390
00:34:14,888 --> 00:34:18,183
- You took me home last night, didn't you?
- Well, the body anyway.

391
00:34:18,392 --> 00:34:21,186
Listen, Red,
I've got something to suggest.

392
00:34:21,395 --> 00:34:23,021
- Yeah?
- Yeah.

393
00:34:23,230 --> 00:34:24,940
I seen it coming from a long way off.

394
00:34:25,107 --> 00:34:27,943
- You want me to quit, for instance.
- Yeah, for instance, I do.

395
00:34:28,110 --> 00:34:30,362
Yeah, and for instance, I won't.

396
00:34:30,529 --> 00:34:32,155
Not even if we get married?

397
00:34:32,322 --> 00:34:36,326
Oh, Gil, I'm in it now. I'm a Ziegfeld girl.

398
00:34:36,493 --> 00:34:40,163
You sound like a bottle of milk
that just got certified.

399
00:34:41,456 --> 00:34:43,417
Oh, Gil, don't spoil things.

400
00:34:43,584 --> 00:34:46,378
I just gotta see it through, don't I?

401
00:34:46,587 --> 00:34:49,506
What will I tell our grandkids if I don't?

402
00:34:51,592 --> 00:34:55,220
Dames is just like traffic. Sometimes you
gotta stop, sometimes you gotta go.

403
00:34:55,429 --> 00:34:58,265
Yeah, but a smart driver
don't beat the lights.

404
00:35:05,731 --> 00:35:09,651
Okay. So you know your own strength.

405
00:35:10,777 --> 00:35:13,822
You ain't exactly anemic
yourself, you know.

406
00:35:14,948 --> 00:35:17,492
Show's out at 11:30.

407
00:35:17,951 --> 00:35:20,746
I'll be there at 11:28.

408
00:35:21,955 --> 00:35:25,584
And if I have to push one of them
limousines out of the way with my truck...

409
00:35:25,792 --> 00:35:28,170
...I can do that too.

410
00:35:30,797 --> 00:35:32,382
Bye.

411
00:36:42,786 --> 00:36:44,663
- Hi, beautiful.
- Hello, Flatbush.

412
00:36:44,830 --> 00:36:45,789
- Hello.
- Hello, Merton.

413
00:36:45,998 --> 00:36:48,709
- Good evening, Mr. Collis.
- You certainly look wonderful.

414
00:36:48,876 --> 00:36:50,419
You don't look so bad yourself.

415
00:36:50,586 --> 00:36:52,379
- Shall we dance to our table?
- Love to.

416
00:36:52,546 --> 00:36:54,047
See you later.

417
00:36:54,756 --> 00:36:56,508
- Good evening.
- Hello.

418
00:36:56,717 --> 00:36:58,343
Good evening, Sandra.

419
00:37:00,429 --> 00:37:02,181
How are you, Sandra?

420
00:37:02,389 --> 00:37:05,267
- Hello, Sandra. How are you?
- Fine, thank you.

421
00:37:06,143 --> 00:37:08,020
I'm beginning to think I'm quite a guy.

422
00:37:08,228 --> 00:37:11,523
- What delayed you?
- All those wolves with envy in their eyes.

423
00:37:11,690 --> 00:37:13,400
Who do you pick to go out with?

424
00:37:13,567 --> 00:37:15,903
- That's because you're so safe.
- Me, safe?

425
00:37:16,069 --> 00:37:18,989
Certainly. We're both married,
and we both know it.

426
00:37:19,156 --> 00:37:21,158
Isn't there a word for it?

427
00:37:21,325 --> 00:37:23,035
Insurance.

428
00:37:23,243 --> 00:37:25,954
I don't feel like such a good risk.

429
00:37:26,538 --> 00:37:28,415
Oh, I wish my husband could know you.

430
00:37:28,582 --> 00:37:31,627
He was so afraid I'd meet
nothing but wolves.

431
00:37:31,793 --> 00:37:34,630
I'm only wolf on my father's side.

432
00:37:34,796 --> 00:37:37,090
- How about it. Hungry?
- I could eat a horse.

433
00:37:37,257 --> 00:37:40,719
- Only I suppose the things are fattening.
- How many calories in a horse?

434
00:37:40,886 --> 00:37:43,222
Enough for a day at least, monsieur.

435
00:37:43,430 --> 00:37:46,808
Perhaps madame would like some
delicious rognons de veau grillé.

436
00:37:46,975 --> 00:37:50,854
Or perhaps foie gras au porto?

437
00:37:51,021 --> 00:37:54,316
See anything about me that makes
you think I could understand French?

438
00:37:54,483 --> 00:37:56,777
But, yes, madame. Plenty.

439
00:37:59,279 --> 00:38:03,033
Think I better order by ear.
Bring me a stack of wheat.

440
00:38:03,200 --> 00:38:05,244
Crepes suzette for the lady.

441
00:38:05,452 --> 00:38:07,496
A stack of wheats for the lady!

442
00:38:07,663 --> 00:38:09,915
They serve them
sort of folded up here, Sheila.

443
00:38:10,123 --> 00:38:13,085
- Which? The ladies?
- No. The hotcakes.

444
00:38:13,252 --> 00:38:15,045
Okay. Fold up some for me.

445
00:38:19,800 --> 00:38:23,303
Maybe with a French accent,
they're not fattening.

446
00:38:28,934 --> 00:38:30,894
You know, I like you.

447
00:38:31,353 --> 00:38:32,938
You're kind of a novelty to me.

448
00:38:33,647 --> 00:38:34,898
Shall we drink to that?

449
00:38:35,065 --> 00:38:38,193
- Oh, no, I have a lot left.
- Why don't you drink it up.

450
00:38:38,360 --> 00:38:43,323
What for? I figure it's always more fun to
be conscious when you have a good time.

451
00:38:43,490 --> 00:38:46,451
And you and Gil have
good times together, huh?

452
00:38:46,660 --> 00:38:48,745
When we're not battling.

453
00:38:49,329 --> 00:38:52,249
You know, a place like this takes
all the fight right out of me.

454
00:38:52,416 --> 00:38:56,128
And after 20 years of developing
a good left hook.

455
00:38:56,920 --> 00:38:58,463
Tell me...

456
00:38:58,672 --> 00:39:01,592
...what are you going to do
with the rest of your life?

457
00:39:01,758 --> 00:39:03,927
Live it. What else is there to do with it?

458
00:39:04,094 --> 00:39:07,222
Don't tell me you're the one woman
who doesn't think she has talent?

459
00:39:07,389 --> 00:39:09,683
Oh, I have talent, all right.

460
00:39:09,850 --> 00:39:14,146
- Being good company.
- Which should be rewarded.

461
00:39:20,194 --> 00:39:23,238
Here we are. How about this?

462
00:39:24,531 --> 00:39:26,491
Look.

463
00:39:26,909 --> 00:39:30,370
Gee, looks good enough
to eat with a spoon.

464
00:39:30,537 --> 00:39:32,164
Well, try it on.

465
00:39:32,789 --> 00:39:36,877
- It'll fit.
- Come on. Let's make sure, shall we?

466
00:39:40,172 --> 00:39:42,716
Are you making a pass at me?

467
00:39:43,634 --> 00:39:46,345
It appears that I am, Sheila.

468
00:39:46,595 --> 00:39:48,514
A forward pass?

469
00:39:48,722 --> 00:39:50,641
Very forward.

470
00:39:51,725 --> 00:39:53,227
Well?

471
00:39:53,393 --> 00:39:55,437
Do I complete it?

472
00:39:56,563 --> 00:39:59,107
Nobody's blocking you.

473
00:40:11,954 --> 00:40:14,081
Oh, it's time to wake up.

474
00:40:14,248 --> 00:40:18,418
Now, look, honey. You want to see your
name out there in 6-foot lights, right?

475
00:40:18,585 --> 00:40:20,754
Then you've got to give until it hurts, right?

476
00:40:20,921 --> 00:40:23,423
But don't you have to think
of the people's eardrums?

477
00:40:23,841 --> 00:40:26,969
It's about time for me and you
to do a little arithmetic, I guess.

478
00:40:27,135 --> 00:40:29,888
- How old are you?
- Seventeen, but when we travel by train...

479
00:40:30,097 --> 00:40:31,640
...you try to shade it.
- I know.

480
00:40:31,807 --> 00:40:35,811
- How long have you been in show business?
- Taking time off for school, about 10 years.

481
00:40:35,978 --> 00:40:37,896
- How old am I?
- Forty-two.

482
00:40:38,063 --> 00:40:40,190
It's okay. Nobody's listening.
How old am I?

483
00:40:40,357 --> 00:40:42,860
- Fifty-five.
- How long have I been in show business?

484
00:40:43,068 --> 00:40:44,403
- Fifty-five years.
- Right!

485
00:40:44,570 --> 00:40:47,990
So when I ask you to peddle a song,
peddle it. Like this:

486
00:40:57,708 --> 00:41:01,837
You see how I sock it across?
Now I'm going after them!

487
00:41:14,975 --> 00:41:19,396
You see? I got them right in my pocket.
You see what I mean, honey?

488
00:41:19,563 --> 00:41:21,440
I give all I've got!

489
00:41:21,607 --> 00:41:24,276
But isn't that just a little bit
too much, Pop?

490
00:41:24,443 --> 00:41:28,113
No? Okay. All right. Well, we'll try
it again, and I'll give all I've got.

491
00:41:28,280 --> 00:41:29,573
Good!

492
00:41:38,165 --> 00:41:40,000
- Hello, Sandra.
- Hello, Jerry.

493
00:41:40,167 --> 00:41:42,794
Listen to the kid sling her larynx around.

494
00:41:53,847 --> 00:41:55,307
Susie, you're good!

495
00:41:55,516 --> 00:41:58,560
- Good? You're terrific!
- Oh, thanks.

496
00:41:58,727 --> 00:41:59,770
Gosh, I got a public.

497
00:42:00,020 --> 00:42:02,940
If you'd only seen her sell it,
then you'd really buy it!

498
00:42:03,106 --> 00:42:05,234
Who's selling what?

499
00:42:05,400 --> 00:42:07,152
- I'm in a buying mood.
- Hello, sis.

500
00:42:07,319 --> 00:42:09,780
- Hello.
- Listen. I just discovered Susie can sing.

501
00:42:09,947 --> 00:42:13,075
You gotta get her to Ziggy. You can do it.
You can do anything.

502
00:42:13,242 --> 00:42:16,411
Oh. Well, I don't know about anything,
but I'll do my best.

503
00:42:16,578 --> 00:42:18,914
My best is pretty good, huh?

504
00:42:20,040 --> 00:42:23,710
Say, where did you people
ever find this joint?

505
00:42:24,586 --> 00:42:26,880
It's cheap and it's near our work.

506
00:42:27,047 --> 00:42:29,299
Say, Sandra, help me pick out
an apartment.

507
00:42:29,466 --> 00:42:33,136
I'd probably wind up with something
pretty awful. Too many ruffles or...

508
00:42:33,303 --> 00:42:36,682
You're worried about ruffles,
what's the matter with Flatbush?

509
00:42:38,308 --> 00:42:41,395
Come on, you two kids, and I'll buy you
a soda. Dutch treat.

510
00:42:41,562 --> 00:42:42,980
Make mine a cone.

511
00:42:43,146 --> 00:42:47,317
- Too many ruffles on a soda.
- Well, we'll be right back.

512
00:42:50,112 --> 00:42:53,824
Well, Geoffrey says that I ought
to be near my work too.

513
00:42:54,449 --> 00:42:55,993
I only met Gil once...

514
00:42:57,744 --> 00:42:59,454
...but I liked him.

515
00:42:59,788 --> 00:43:01,874
Well, what's so smart
about what you're doing?

516
00:43:02,082 --> 00:43:03,709
I'm not trying to be smart.

517
00:43:03,917 --> 00:43:06,712
With every guy sitting up
on his hindlegs and barking...

518
00:43:06,879 --> 00:43:10,048
...you pick out one that sings
for his supper.

519
00:43:10,257 --> 00:43:13,385
Oh, honey, I'm sorry.
I'm always popping off.

520
00:43:13,594 --> 00:43:16,471
I only meant you're not going to get
anywhere with that tenor.

521
00:43:16,638 --> 00:43:20,601
Why do you think he keeps a wife around?
Because wives are handy.

522
00:43:20,767 --> 00:43:24,521
Oh, it's just that I don't want him
to put anything over on you.

523
00:43:24,688 --> 00:43:27,441
It's easy to handle a man...

524
00:43:27,941 --> 00:43:32,738
...if you're not too much in love with him.
- Oh, love. There's that silly word again.

525
00:43:32,946 --> 00:43:36,783
Gee, Sandra, why can't the men
you want have the things you want?

526
00:43:36,950 --> 00:43:40,162
I beg your pardon, Miss Hale.
Mr. Collis told me to pick you up here.

527
00:43:40,329 --> 00:43:42,247
Oh, all right. Thank you.

528
00:43:42,873 --> 00:43:45,083
See what I mean?

529
00:43:51,715 --> 00:43:57,012
"What little redhead made a world's
record standing broad jump...

530
00:43:57,179 --> 00:43:59,723
...from Flatbush to Park Avenue?"

531
00:43:59,890 --> 00:44:02,434
When she finished, wonder
if she landed on her feet.

532
00:44:02,643 --> 00:44:03,936
That kind of gal always does.

533
00:44:04,144 --> 00:44:08,565
They keep printing that stuff, and a guy's
double life won't be his own anymore.

534
00:44:10,734 --> 00:44:12,986
- Take it down, Buck.
- What for?

535
00:44:13,153 --> 00:44:18,408
- I thought you liked it. This one anyway.
- Take it down, or I'll take you down.

536
00:44:18,575 --> 00:44:22,246
Hey! Why sock a guy who's
only playing around with a picture?

537
00:44:22,871 --> 00:44:26,124
- Anybody else got an eye for pictures?
- I'm an art critic!

538
00:44:26,333 --> 00:44:28,001
- Wait a minute!
- Wait. He started it.

539
00:44:28,168 --> 00:44:30,796
Come on! Break it up here!
What's the matter with you?!

540
00:44:42,683 --> 00:44:47,145
Screwiest way of getting yourself
waked up I ever saw. By a fancy smell.

541
00:44:48,313 --> 00:44:53,527
Not if you've been used
to the 7:20 garbage wagon. What's new?

542
00:44:53,902 --> 00:44:57,614
Nothing much, except your folks is coming
home from Yellowstone Park next week.

543
00:44:57,781 --> 00:45:00,742
They liked the bears all right,
but they didn't like the geezers.

544
00:45:02,661 --> 00:45:04,454
Geysers.

545
00:45:04,621 --> 00:45:08,292
Say, how do you know? Been working
that Ouija board of yours again?

546
00:45:08,458 --> 00:45:11,545
No. You got a telegram
from your ma this morning.

547
00:45:11,712 --> 00:45:15,257
- And you read it?
- Just casually glanced a little.

548
00:45:16,383 --> 00:45:19,261
Say, why didn't your brother
go along with your folks?

549
00:45:19,928 --> 00:45:22,723
Oh, I don't know.
Jerry's got ideas of his own.

550
00:45:22,890 --> 00:45:24,725
And I don't pry into them.

551
00:45:24,892 --> 00:45:27,186
Well, that trip must have
cost you a wad of money.

552
00:45:27,352 --> 00:45:31,064
Well, what's money for?
Whose money was it?

553
00:45:32,733 --> 00:45:34,860
Yours, honey.

554
00:45:40,240 --> 00:45:44,286
- Hey! Deliveries in the rear.
- I'm not delivering. I'm collecting.

555
00:45:47,748 --> 00:45:50,125
- Gil!
- Yeah.

556
00:45:51,126 --> 00:45:52,961
Imagine seeing me here.

557
00:45:55,589 --> 00:45:58,967
Where did you get that? Walk into a door
someplace else without knocking?

558
00:45:59,134 --> 00:46:00,719
No.

559
00:46:00,928 --> 00:46:03,639
Going-away present from a pal.

560
00:46:05,015 --> 00:46:08,310
- Nice place you've got here.
- Some people might like it.

561
00:46:08,477 --> 00:46:11,522
- Got the address from Jerry.
- Took you long enough to use it.

562
00:46:13,065 --> 00:46:14,733
I thought maybe I might not have to.

563
00:46:16,360 --> 00:46:17,819
How is Jerry?

564
00:46:18,153 --> 00:46:20,322
Jerry's fine.

565
00:46:20,739 --> 00:46:24,034
Those music lessons sure are taking
your place with him.

566
00:46:24,826 --> 00:46:27,538
I guess Jerry and me
is just two of a kind.

567
00:46:28,330 --> 00:46:30,165
The dumb kind.

568
00:46:30,332 --> 00:46:33,001
I got something here to prove it.

569
00:46:33,961 --> 00:46:36,171
A marriage license.

570
00:46:36,630 --> 00:46:38,257
Remember?

571
00:46:38,841 --> 00:46:40,843
Oh, Gil.

572
00:46:41,301 --> 00:46:44,429
I wasn't sure about exactly
how old you are.

573
00:46:44,930 --> 00:46:47,474
I put down "over the age of consent."

574
00:46:47,641 --> 00:46:49,434
Guess you are, all right.

575
00:46:50,143 --> 00:46:52,938
- Are you making a crack?
- lf the shoe fits, put it on.

576
00:46:53,146 --> 00:46:56,859
Well, I'm getting tired
of playing Cinderella.

577
00:46:59,444 --> 00:47:02,865
People who wear glass slippers
shouldn't walk on rocks.

578
00:47:09,246 --> 00:47:10,998
Look, Red.

579
00:47:11,248 --> 00:47:13,709
Suppose I was to tell you
I've developed a blind spot?

580
00:47:13,876 --> 00:47:15,878
Suppose I'm not seeing any of this?

581
00:47:16,044 --> 00:47:17,588
We're not here at all.

582
00:47:17,754 --> 00:47:21,175
We're in Coney Island that first night
we met, you remember?

583
00:47:21,341 --> 00:47:22,968
You remember?

584
00:47:23,343 --> 00:47:27,347
A pretty good moon,
and you let me kiss you...

585
00:47:27,514 --> 00:47:29,850
...after only slapping me twice.

586
00:47:30,017 --> 00:47:33,520
- Three times.
- Okay, three.

587
00:47:33,937 --> 00:47:38,317
And then I tell you you'll do for me.
And you tell me I'll do for you.

588
00:47:40,277 --> 00:47:44,364
- But this isn't Coney Island, Gil.
- Let's make it like it is.

589
00:47:45,699 --> 00:47:48,202
Now is it Coney Island, Red?

590
00:47:52,915 --> 00:47:55,417
It's still Park Avenue, Gil.

591
00:48:01,715 --> 00:48:03,675
Gil, come here.

592
00:48:05,677 --> 00:48:07,888
I want to show you something.

593
00:48:08,555 --> 00:48:11,183
I want to show you why it's Park Avenue.

594
00:48:12,476 --> 00:48:15,562
Why it's different from any place
I've ever been.

595
00:48:15,771 --> 00:48:17,189
Gil...

596
00:48:17,731 --> 00:48:20,192
...did you ever go to a party
when you were a kid...

597
00:48:20,359 --> 00:48:23,862
...and have them run out of ice cream
and cake before they got to you?

598
00:48:24,071 --> 00:48:28,408
Well, that's the way I've felt
all my life, until now.

599
00:48:31,787 --> 00:48:33,455
Look, Gil.

600
00:48:34,915 --> 00:48:37,251
Take a look at all those shoes.

601
00:48:37,417 --> 00:48:40,712
Why, I don't even have to have
the heels fixed anymore.

602
00:48:43,090 --> 00:48:46,426
And here.
Look at all these dresses.

603
00:48:46,593 --> 00:48:51,765
I mean, frocks. They get dirty,
I throw them away.

604
00:48:53,767 --> 00:48:55,519
Gil?

605
00:48:55,936 --> 00:48:59,690
Remember how I saved and scrimped
for that genuine wolf collar.

606
00:48:59,857 --> 00:49:03,026
And then it smelled like
a dog when it got wet?

607
00:49:03,360 --> 00:49:04,736
Well...

608
00:49:04,945 --> 00:49:08,240
...now I can walk on fur if I want to.

609
00:49:08,448 --> 00:49:10,200
But not on me, baby!

610
00:49:10,617 --> 00:49:14,496
I'm no rug. I don't come wrapped up
in no mink coat either.

611
00:49:15,956 --> 00:49:18,333
Gil! Gil!

612
00:49:18,500 --> 00:49:20,252
Annie!

613
00:49:21,545 --> 00:49:25,048
- Annie, did he go?
- Fast, and I hope far.

614
00:49:25,215 --> 00:49:29,720
If that guy's a gent, I'll never get
a seat in the subway. What's the matter?

615
00:49:30,637 --> 00:49:32,347
Do I look like anything's the matter?

616
00:49:32,806 --> 00:49:34,016
You look sunk.

617
00:49:34,183 --> 00:49:37,394
Yeah, he'd like to think I was sunk.
Without a trace.

618
00:49:38,812 --> 00:49:41,440
Well, you better come to the surface.

619
00:49:41,607 --> 00:49:43,567
Mr. Geoff's coming over pretty soon.

620
00:49:43,775 --> 00:49:46,403
- I know.
- And Mr. Geoff likes you full of zip.

621
00:49:47,362 --> 00:49:48,780
Annie?

622
00:49:48,947 --> 00:49:51,158
What goes on with life anyway?

623
00:49:51,325 --> 00:49:56,038
- Why does it get so messed up?
- Life don't. People does.

624
00:49:56,747 --> 00:49:58,165
Neat, but not gaudy.

625
00:49:58,332 --> 00:50:01,335
Now, you know I don't like that stuff.
Tastes like cough syrup.

626
00:50:01,502 --> 00:50:03,795
Old Four Oaks is good for what ails you.

627
00:50:08,258 --> 00:50:09,927
What is it ails me, Annie?

628
00:50:10,844 --> 00:50:14,806
You got two guys and only one address.
It don't work out.

629
00:50:31,323 --> 00:50:33,033
Hi there, Gil.

630
00:50:33,700 --> 00:50:36,578
Oh, hello, Nick. What are you
doing so far away from Brooklyn?

631
00:50:36,745 --> 00:50:40,165
Brooklyn? Where's Brooklyn?

632
00:50:40,374 --> 00:50:42,918
- Have a drink. Waiter.
- I had a drink.

633
00:50:43,085 --> 00:50:45,254
- Have another.
- Had another.

634
00:50:45,420 --> 00:50:47,631
Okay. Then sit down
and straighten your halo.

635
00:50:47,798 --> 00:50:50,300
All right. Give me a shot of bourbon.

636
00:50:53,220 --> 00:50:56,139
I've been wanting to get next
to a good, pure truck driver.

637
00:50:56,306 --> 00:50:57,683
Ex-truck.

638
00:50:57,850 --> 00:50:59,268
- Bounced?
- Yeah.

639
00:50:59,434 --> 00:51:02,145
Yeah, I got this when I hit the ceiling.

640
00:51:04,857 --> 00:51:07,568
I got a truck that ain't
been unwrapped yet.

641
00:51:08,235 --> 00:51:11,530
- I got a fleet of trucks.
- Yeah. Heard all about them.

642
00:51:11,738 --> 00:51:13,699
Also heard what they haul.

643
00:51:13,907 --> 00:51:17,661
- Those loads pay off.
- Yeah, with a bullet in the belly.

644
00:51:17,911 --> 00:51:19,913
You got a tender belly?

645
00:51:20,747 --> 00:51:24,251
If I can take this,
what can a bullet do to my belly?

646
00:51:26,295 --> 00:51:29,339
- What do you get for wheeling a truck?
- Twenty-five.

647
00:51:29,506 --> 00:51:30,883
A day?

648
00:51:31,049 --> 00:51:33,093
No, a week.

649
00:51:34,386 --> 00:51:38,849
How would you like to collect
450 frogskins a week?

650
00:51:40,309 --> 00:51:42,186
What, for wheeling a truck?

651
00:51:42,352 --> 00:51:44,396
That and other things.

652
00:51:45,606 --> 00:51:49,026
- Of course, if I'm boring you, I'll...
- No, no, no.

653
00:51:49,193 --> 00:51:54,573
No, if my mouth was wide open, it wasn't
because I was yawning. No. Sit down, Nick.

654
00:51:57,618 --> 00:52:01,163
I got a special use for some big dough.

655
00:52:08,045 --> 00:52:10,756
All right, break it up.
Ten minutes rest.

656
00:52:10,923 --> 00:52:14,468
Just because we're taking the show on
the road, you can't start letting down.

657
00:52:14,635 --> 00:52:18,680
You either gotta get me a mink coat
or put steam heat in my apartment.

658
00:52:19,348 --> 00:52:21,767
Oh, boy, I wish I was going
where that trunk's going!

659
00:52:23,685 --> 00:52:27,105
That's a cinch, honey.
Just get to be a Ziegfeld girl.

660
00:52:28,023 --> 00:52:31,068
- Hello, Susie.
- Hello, Al. What are you doing here?

661
00:52:31,235 --> 00:52:33,946
Hello, Ed. I heard you were here,
and I got a proposition.

662
00:52:34,154 --> 00:52:36,949
No time for propositions.
We're due right now for an audition.

663
00:52:37,157 --> 00:52:39,910
This is Susan's big chance.
Then we're going to Palm Beach...

664
00:52:40,077 --> 00:52:43,288
Listen, Ed, I got a routine
that's money in the mattress.

665
00:52:43,497 --> 00:52:47,167
I gotta have a guy to do it with so we can
get the bookings. Who did I think of?

666
00:52:47,334 --> 00:52:48,335
- Me, naturally.
- Sure.

667
00:52:48,502 --> 00:52:51,129
- How about Mabel?
- I'm tired of her. She don't wear well.

668
00:52:51,296 --> 00:52:53,632
That's it! Take the best years
of a girl's life!

669
00:52:53,841 --> 00:52:56,301
Shut up, Mabel.
Us men is talking business.

670
00:52:56,468 --> 00:52:59,388
So I thought maybe if you
were getting tired of this clambake...

671
00:52:59,555 --> 00:53:02,975
I don't know. I've been working
my fingers to the bone, grooming Susan.

672
00:53:03,141 --> 00:53:05,143
Pop, maybe we'd better go with Al.

673
00:53:05,352 --> 00:53:08,647
Susie! Slayton's waiting, honey,
and I don't think he'll wait very long.

674
00:53:08,856 --> 00:53:10,440
- Oh, I can't sing!
- Nonsense!

675
00:53:11,525 --> 00:53:14,987
- My throat's closed up.
- Come on, or I'll close an eye for you!

676
00:53:15,654 --> 00:53:18,031
Here's the kid that's gonna
knock you in the eye!

677
00:53:18,198 --> 00:53:21,159
- I'll try and keep my feet under me.
- He's like a cat that way.

678
00:53:21,326 --> 00:53:23,078
Well, commence.

679
00:53:24,830 --> 00:53:27,749
Come on, honey. Louder and bigger does it!

680
00:53:28,709 --> 00:53:30,919
Great performer, my kid. Makes me proud.

681
00:53:31,086 --> 00:53:32,921
Like looking in a mirror.

682
00:53:34,339 --> 00:53:36,508
Quiet, girls. Quiet!

683
00:53:36,717 --> 00:53:39,219
Come on, honey.
Hook them right in the gills!

684
00:54:06,163 --> 00:54:07,414
Hold it!

685
00:54:07,873 --> 00:54:10,918
Don't you know they quit beating
a song to death 10 years ago?

686
00:54:11,084 --> 00:54:15,047
- Oh, another intellectual.
- Won't do, honey, won't do.

687
00:54:15,214 --> 00:54:17,591
You don't slug an audience
from the front nowadays.

688
00:54:17,758 --> 00:54:19,593
You kind of sneak up on it from behind.

689
00:54:21,678 --> 00:54:25,641
Say, you're not gonna count this kid out
with only one strike on her, are you?

690
00:54:25,933 --> 00:54:27,434
Wait a minute.

691
00:54:27,601 --> 00:54:30,145
- You know that song, boys.
- Surely.

692
00:54:30,312 --> 00:54:31,855
Give her a little help, will you?

693
00:54:32,022 --> 00:54:34,650
Just... Just a little slower, please.

694
00:54:35,317 --> 00:54:36,860
I understand.

695
00:56:47,950 --> 00:56:49,701
Oh, Susie!

696
00:56:51,078 --> 00:56:54,706
Get Ziegfeld, will you, kid? I found
something worth listening to for a change!

697
00:56:54,873 --> 00:56:56,375
- You found?
- Who's found?

698
00:56:56,583 --> 00:56:58,794
Great stuff, kid.
After you hoed the corn.

699
00:56:58,961 --> 00:57:00,420
Thank you.

700
00:57:00,671 --> 00:57:02,089
Susie! That was wonderful!

701
00:57:02,256 --> 00:57:04,049
- Pop!
- Susie, that was wonderful!

702
00:57:04,216 --> 00:57:07,678
Thanks. Thanks a lot.
Pop, wait for me!

703
00:57:14,518 --> 00:57:17,729
Better take your woolens.
It's awful cold in Detroit.

704
00:57:17,896 --> 00:57:22,609
Don't worry, honey. Al and me will frame
up an act hot enough to fry an egg on.

705
00:57:22,776 --> 00:57:27,239
Gee, this is the first time we've
ever been separated, isn't it?

706
00:57:27,698 --> 00:57:30,284
Remember when I was
going to school?

707
00:57:30,576 --> 00:57:33,370
You wouldn't take bookings out of town.

708
00:57:33,912 --> 00:57:36,081
Even when you could get them.

709
00:57:37,291 --> 00:57:41,837
Nobody could ever separate us,
could they?

710
00:57:42,296 --> 00:57:45,465
You wouldn't be trying to soften me up,
would you, honey?

711
00:57:45,632 --> 00:57:48,093
Give me that armor plate.

712
00:57:48,260 --> 00:57:52,681
Don't you know it's awfully cold
in Detroit?

713
00:58:01,481 --> 00:58:04,651
Oh, Pop! Pop!

714
00:58:06,069 --> 00:58:08,363
Take me with you, Pop!
Take me with you!

715
00:58:08,530 --> 00:58:10,949
I don't want this job anyway.

716
00:58:12,159 --> 00:58:16,788
Oh, I don't mean that.
I do want the job.

717
00:58:17,456 --> 00:58:20,042
But I hope I didn't make
you feel bad today.

718
00:58:20,209 --> 00:58:21,793
Mr. Slayton liked the way I sang.

719
00:58:21,960 --> 00:58:24,254
Slayton! He's just a Johnny-newcomer.

720
00:58:24,421 --> 00:58:26,507
There's nothing solid
about his technique.

721
00:58:26,673 --> 00:58:29,510
He's a flash in the pan.
He's all wrong.

722
00:58:30,135 --> 00:58:35,974
Wrong for you maybe, Pop,
but right for me maybe?

723
00:58:36,183 --> 00:58:37,476
Maybe.

724
00:58:38,519 --> 00:58:41,355
- Then you're not mad at me?
- Mad?

725
00:58:41,522 --> 00:58:45,275
How could I be mad at anybody
for doing what I would have done myself?

726
00:58:45,984 --> 00:58:49,029
- Oh, Pop!
- I'm not mad. I'm proud.

727
00:58:49,196 --> 00:58:52,324
You stood there
and made them like it, honey.

728
00:58:52,908 --> 00:58:55,744
- So long.
- Do you have to go?

729
00:58:55,911 --> 00:58:58,872
Yeah, just like you had to do
what you did today.

730
00:58:59,039 --> 00:59:01,750
And don't forget,
we're a couple of troupers.

731
00:59:01,917 --> 00:59:04,753
And I ain't worried about
leaving you alone, Susie...

732
00:59:04,920 --> 00:59:07,130
...because you're no ordinary kid.

733
00:59:07,631 --> 00:59:11,760
- You know why that is?
- I do know, Pop. I do.

734
00:59:12,344 --> 00:59:15,681
- Why?
- It's because...

735
00:59:15,848 --> 00:59:18,016
...you're no ordinary father.

736
00:59:19,101 --> 00:59:20,686
Right.

737
00:59:23,772 --> 00:59:25,691
Pop?

738
00:59:27,484 --> 00:59:28,569
Pop?

739
00:59:33,448 --> 00:59:35,325
Blow, honey.

740
00:59:35,826 --> 00:59:37,703
Thanks.

741
00:59:38,203 --> 00:59:39,872
What you got to cry about?

742
00:59:40,038 --> 00:59:44,001
By the time you get back from Florida,
Pop will be home, and you'll be laughing.

743
00:59:44,168 --> 00:59:46,503
You're a cinch for a specialty
in the next Follies.

744
00:59:46,670 --> 00:59:48,755
I heard Slayton popping off.

745
00:59:48,922 --> 00:59:51,508
- Do you think so?
- Why, sure.

746
00:59:52,426 --> 00:59:53,719
Hey, Susie?

747
00:59:53,886 --> 00:59:58,348
You suppose you could kind of keep an eye
on Sheila while you're down in Florida?

748
00:59:58,599 --> 01:00:01,351
She needs someone like you around.

749
01:00:01,685 --> 01:00:03,812
Don't worry, Jerry.

750
01:00:03,979 --> 01:00:05,898
Every time I think of you...

751
01:00:06,064 --> 01:00:08,859
...l'll be looking after Sheila.

752
01:00:09,234 --> 01:00:13,197
That means I'll be looking
after her a lot.

753
01:00:35,385 --> 01:00:38,514
Seems the lady's having trouble
with the language again.

754
01:00:41,350 --> 01:00:43,143
I give lessons, you know.

755
01:00:43,310 --> 01:00:44,770
You finish the word like this.

756
01:00:47,397 --> 01:00:48,398
FRANK

757
01:00:48,815 --> 01:00:52,236
Funny. They taught me
To finish it this way.

758
01:00:54,488 --> 01:00:57,449
You probably drove your teachers crazy.

759
01:00:58,408 --> 01:00:59,910
With my spelling?

760
01:01:00,077 --> 01:01:02,913
No. Not with your spelling.

761
01:01:03,956 --> 01:01:07,167
Sandra, you've gotta make up my mind.

762
01:01:07,334 --> 01:01:11,213
You've gotta tell me whether I'm
sitting, standing, crawling or flying.

763
01:01:11,380 --> 01:01:14,049
Must I worry about your mind too?

764
01:01:14,216 --> 01:01:17,427
I have enough trouble with my own.

765
01:01:18,095 --> 01:01:20,222
I'm glad to hear that.

766
01:01:21,181 --> 01:01:24,977
Sometimes, I think
I'll never learn to spell.

767
01:01:25,143 --> 01:01:27,187
I believe you will.

768
01:01:27,688 --> 01:01:30,148
You're a pretty smart girl.

769
01:01:30,816 --> 01:01:34,111
If not knowing what you want
is being smart...

770
01:01:34,278 --> 01:01:36,280
...then I'm smart.

771
01:01:38,448 --> 01:01:41,577
I'm having a little trouble
with the language myself.

772
01:01:42,619 --> 01:01:44,621
Write it for me.

773
01:01:45,706 --> 01:01:49,626
A smart girl never puts anything
in writing.

774
01:02:02,181 --> 01:02:04,725
- Sheila?
- I'm in here, Susie.

775
01:02:06,018 --> 01:02:08,020
Do you mind if I park in here
for a minute?

776
01:02:08,187 --> 01:02:11,356
The girls took over my room
for a feed. Thanks.

777
01:02:11,523 --> 01:02:13,817
- Another one of those pep talks from Pop?
- Yeah.

778
01:02:14,318 --> 01:02:17,863
Says, "Last week, we broke
the house record in Omaha."

779
01:02:18,030 --> 01:02:20,908
That means they probably established
a new all-time low.

780
01:02:21,074 --> 01:02:24,536
To Pop and Al,
and a coat of shellac for Mabel.

781
01:02:25,204 --> 01:02:27,998
You know, when Pop sounds cheerful,
that's the time to fret.

782
01:02:28,165 --> 01:02:32,002
He's going to prove he's a success
if he has to starve to death doing it.

783
01:02:32,169 --> 01:02:36,590
Gosh, if I could just hurry
and make good myself...

784
01:02:37,674 --> 01:02:40,969
To Pop, Al, Mabel and Susie.

785
01:02:41,136 --> 01:02:44,223
Oh, I can't stand to fret about you too.

786
01:02:44,389 --> 01:02:48,227
Oh, I apologize to your orchids.

787
01:02:48,393 --> 01:02:51,396
Sheila, you've got to keep your head
if you want to get anyplace.

788
01:02:51,563 --> 01:02:55,692
My head's the one thing I have kept.
It's gotten me everything I've wanted.

789
01:02:55,859 --> 01:02:59,029
So now, if you'll pardon me,
I'll launch myself.

790
01:03:12,084 --> 01:03:14,920
Oh, that's Geoff.
Let him in, will you, Susie?

791
01:03:15,087 --> 01:03:16,338
Sure.

792
01:03:16,505 --> 01:03:18,715
Sure.

793
01:03:23,554 --> 01:03:25,138
- Hello, Mr. Collis.
- Oh, Susie.

794
01:03:25,305 --> 01:03:28,600
This is Annie's night out. I'm
pinch-hitting for her. Let me take that.

795
01:03:28,809 --> 01:03:31,270
- Oh, thanks.
- Sheila's... She'll be ready in a minute.

796
01:03:31,436 --> 01:03:33,230
Oh, all right.

797
01:03:37,442 --> 01:03:41,738
- Well, how are you, Susie?
- Oh, fine. Fine.

798
01:03:42,281 --> 01:03:45,409
- Can I get you a drink or something?
- No, thanks.

799
01:03:47,077 --> 01:03:49,997
Here, let me.

800
01:03:52,291 --> 01:03:53,625
- There.
- Thanks.

801
01:03:53,834 --> 01:03:55,627
It's all right.

802
01:03:56,587 --> 01:03:59,464
- Sit over here. It's much more comfortable.
- This is all right.

803
01:03:59,631 --> 01:04:03,927
No, this is more comfortable. You'll like
this chair better. Here, sit over here.

804
01:04:08,015 --> 01:04:09,808
- You comfortable?
- Oh, fine, thanks.

805
01:04:10,017 --> 01:04:11,768
That's good.

806
01:04:12,436 --> 01:04:13,979
You know something?

807
01:04:14,146 --> 01:04:16,273
- Sheila's a swell girl.
- Oh, I know.

808
01:04:16,440 --> 01:04:18,108
She's got a heart of gold.

809
01:04:18,275 --> 01:04:19,985
She's awfully good to her mother.

810
01:04:20,152 --> 01:04:22,321
She takes care of her whole family,
you know.

811
01:04:22,654 --> 01:04:28,660
Of course, she's not so good
at taking care of herself. Is she?

812
01:04:30,746 --> 01:04:32,164
Well, isn't she?

813
01:04:32,331 --> 01:04:34,333
I don't know. I mean, I always felt...

814
01:04:34,499 --> 01:04:38,170
...that she kind of needed someone
around to take care of her.

815
01:04:38,962 --> 01:04:40,964
I don't mean just to buy
her pretty things.

816
01:04:41,131 --> 01:04:44,676
I mean to really take care of her.

817
01:04:46,470 --> 01:04:50,140
You know, I've been thinking to myself,
Mr. Collis. You're a nice man.

818
01:04:50,307 --> 01:04:54,019
You're an awfully nice man, probably one
of the nicest men I've ever met.

819
01:04:54,186 --> 01:04:56,396
- It's very rare, isn't it?
- What? Nice men?

820
01:04:57,022 --> 01:05:01,193
Oh, no. I mean for such a nice man
to meet such a nice girl...

821
01:05:01,360 --> 01:05:05,531
...like you and Sheila, I mean.

822
01:05:06,198 --> 01:05:08,033
Oh, oh, I see.

823
01:05:08,659 --> 01:05:11,161
Makes me happy just to know
that it can happen.

824
01:05:11,328 --> 01:05:13,038
It's made me very happy too.

825
01:05:13,205 --> 01:05:14,831
Oh, here.

826
01:05:14,998 --> 01:05:16,708
Thanks.

827
01:05:19,044 --> 01:05:20,838
It will be awfully sad, won't it?

828
01:05:21,004 --> 01:05:23,882
- What?
- I mean, when two such nice people...

829
01:05:24,049 --> 01:05:27,886
...like you and Sheila
just sort of drift apart...

830
01:05:28,053 --> 01:05:29,388
...like people do.

831
01:05:29,555 --> 01:05:30,848
That's life, Susie.

832
01:05:31,014 --> 01:05:34,017
It doesn't have to be. There's a way
to stop from drifting apart.

833
01:05:34,184 --> 01:05:39,690
- What, have they discovered something new?
- Well, no, it's not exactly new.

834
01:05:39,857 --> 01:05:42,526
People have been doing it
for quite some time.

835
01:05:43,068 --> 01:05:45,404
Getting married, I mean.

836
01:05:48,574 --> 01:05:50,576
What's so funny about that?

837
01:05:50,742 --> 01:05:53,036
Pop says there's nothing funny
about marriage.

838
01:05:53,203 --> 01:05:54,913
Just ask the man who owns one.

839
01:05:56,039 --> 01:05:58,542
You're a very sweet child, Susie.

840
01:05:58,709 --> 01:06:01,211
You'll make a wonderful father-in-law.

841
01:06:01,378 --> 01:06:04,590
As a matter of fact, I've examined
my intentions toward Sheila...

842
01:06:04,756 --> 01:06:08,385
...and strangely enough, I find them
to be perfectly honorable.

843
01:06:08,552 --> 01:06:10,429
What do you mean, "strangely enough"?

844
01:06:10,596 --> 01:06:13,432
I mean, strangely enough,
I see her true value too.

845
01:06:13,599 --> 01:06:16,393
I'll be a very lucky man
if she accepts me.

846
01:06:16,894 --> 01:06:18,937
You mean you're proposing? Marriage?

847
01:06:19,104 --> 01:06:21,231
What do you think
about asking her tonight?

848
01:06:21,398 --> 01:06:22,733
Tonight?

849
01:06:22,900 --> 01:06:26,778
Oh, I can't think. I'm so happy!

850
01:06:26,945 --> 01:06:30,407
Do you mind if I say
this is so sudden?

851
01:06:30,574 --> 01:06:33,285
I don't think I'll mind
anything you say, Susie.

852
01:06:33,452 --> 01:06:34,912
Oh, gee.

853
01:06:44,796 --> 01:06:47,758
Give me room. Come on, dice!

854
01:06:47,925 --> 01:06:49,134
There she goes. Come on.

855
01:06:49,301 --> 01:06:51,762
That's it, babies!

856
01:06:51,929 --> 01:06:55,599
Who's the little tomato
with the rebel yell?

857
01:06:57,434 --> 01:06:58,644
Come on, dice.

858
01:06:58,810 --> 01:07:00,812
She's coming out, and it's a six.

859
01:07:00,979 --> 01:07:02,814
It's a cinch.

860
01:07:06,485 --> 01:07:09,279
Whoa, nine, and the lady wins again.

861
01:07:09,446 --> 01:07:11,782
- Luck be a lady. Try it once more?
- No more.

862
01:07:11,949 --> 01:07:13,784
Next lucky shooter. Get them down.

863
01:07:13,951 --> 01:07:15,661
I hope I'm as lucky as you are, lady.

864
01:07:15,744 --> 01:07:17,705
How about trying a little chemin de fer?

865
01:07:17,872 --> 01:07:22,209
Oh, no, not me.
I don't feel like gambling tonight.

866
01:07:22,376 --> 01:07:25,379
Here, Geoff. You go down
and double it for me.

867
01:07:25,546 --> 01:07:27,214
All right.

868
01:07:27,923 --> 01:07:32,261
- When did they put in this flight of stairs?
- Try holding on to the banister, darling.

869
01:07:32,428 --> 01:07:34,221
Oh, now, Geoff.

870
01:07:34,388 --> 01:07:36,765
Sheila, I got something
to ask you tonight...

871
01:07:36,932 --> 01:07:38,267
...something important...

872
01:07:38,434 --> 01:07:41,687
...so don't drink any more, will you?
- All right, I won't.

873
01:07:41,854 --> 01:07:43,272
Promise?

874
01:07:43,439 --> 01:07:46,233
- Cross my heart.
- Thanks.

875
01:07:48,068 --> 01:07:49,778
Double cross it.

876
01:07:50,112 --> 01:07:52,072
- Waiter.
- Yes, madame?

877
01:07:52,239 --> 01:07:54,575
Waiter, the wine list, please.

878
01:07:54,742 --> 01:07:56,702
Yes, madame.

879
01:08:00,789 --> 01:08:03,918
Well, well, and how are you?

880
01:08:05,127 --> 01:08:07,129
- All of a sudden, I got a headache.
- Yeah.

881
01:08:07,296 --> 01:08:09,423
I seen you with him at the crap table.

882
01:08:09,590 --> 01:08:12,259
You're the greatest female crapshooter
I ever saw.

883
01:08:12,426 --> 01:08:13,761
Thanks.

884
01:08:13,928 --> 01:08:16,972
Now that you know just who I am,
who are you?

885
01:08:17,139 --> 01:08:18,807
Jimmy Walters...

886
01:08:18,974 --> 01:08:21,268
...as if you didn't know.

887
01:08:21,435 --> 01:08:23,479
You seen me when I done it.

888
01:08:23,646 --> 01:08:26,774
- Done what?
- Grabbed the title.

889
01:08:26,941 --> 01:08:28,984
Well, what do you know?

890
01:08:29,151 --> 01:08:31,445
I seen you when you done it.

891
01:08:32,279 --> 01:08:33,614
How do you know I did?

892
01:08:33,781 --> 01:08:36,450
Because I spotted you in the second row
at the fight.

893
01:08:36,617 --> 01:08:38,494
Had your headache
with you that night too.

894
01:08:38,661 --> 01:08:40,496
I hope he ain't chronic.

895
01:08:40,663 --> 01:08:44,458
- What will we drink, huh?
- Never touch it, except when I'm on the job.

896
01:08:44,625 --> 01:08:49,505
Soon as I saw you, I said to myself,
"There's a hot-looking little number."

897
01:08:49,672 --> 01:08:51,632
Well, don't let it throw you, champ.

898
01:08:51,799 --> 01:08:54,635
I'm 20 degrees cooler than you think.

899
01:08:55,469 --> 01:08:57,680
One of them refrigerator dames, huh?

900
01:08:57,847 --> 01:09:00,808
That's right. You're not the guy
to defrost me either.

901
01:09:00,975 --> 01:09:05,521
Sorry if that's hitting below the belt, but
that's how you got to be champ, isn't it?

902
01:09:20,995 --> 01:09:23,038
Chin up, you glorified girl.

903
01:09:23,205 --> 01:09:25,499
The stairs are your specialty.

904
01:09:25,666 --> 01:09:27,835
Shoulders relaxed...

905
01:09:28,002 --> 01:09:30,671
...and don't forget to smile.

906
01:09:42,391 --> 01:09:45,227
Okay, Al. See you next week.

907
01:09:47,396 --> 01:09:50,232
I want you to tell the skipper
as soon as he gets to Nassau...

908
01:09:50,399 --> 01:09:52,026
Gil!

909
01:09:55,696 --> 01:09:57,072
Gil.

910
01:09:57,364 --> 01:09:59,408
Hello, Red.

911
01:10:06,290 --> 01:10:07,541
Gil.

912
01:10:13,088 --> 01:10:14,882
Gil!

913
01:10:16,467 --> 01:10:17,968
Gil.

914
01:10:18,260 --> 01:10:22,264
Well, you wouldn't pass up
an old pal, would you?

915
01:10:22,431 --> 01:10:25,601
Boys, Sheila Hale. The Ziegfeld Follies.

916
01:10:25,768 --> 01:10:27,019
- How do you do?
- Hiya.

917
01:10:27,436 --> 01:10:28,729
Hello.

918
01:10:28,896 --> 01:10:32,233
The guy with the cigar is Nick Capalini.

919
01:10:32,942 --> 01:10:36,403
- See you at the boat, Gil.
- Okay, Nick, in a minute.

920
01:10:36,904 --> 01:10:39,281
- Gil...
- I said, a minute.

921
01:10:40,574 --> 01:10:42,743
Isn't that Capalini the gangster?

922
01:10:42,910 --> 01:10:44,912
Well, Nick likes "bootlegger" better.

923
01:10:45,079 --> 01:10:46,956
Nick's sensitive.

924
01:10:47,122 --> 01:10:49,792
- Is that what you are?
- Sensitive? No.

925
01:10:49,959 --> 01:10:51,794
Bootlegger? Yeah.

926
01:10:51,961 --> 01:10:56,090
- Risky, isn't it?
- So is every business that pays off big.

927
01:10:56,465 --> 01:10:58,592
Have you seen the folks, Gil?
How are they?

928
01:10:58,759 --> 01:11:02,263
They're okay. They fixed up the house
till it's the eyesore of Brooklyn.

929
01:11:02,471 --> 01:11:05,391
Every time they get lonesome,
they buy a new piece of furniture.

930
01:11:05,558 --> 01:11:07,434
And Jerry. How's Jerry?

931
01:11:07,601 --> 01:11:09,937
Jerry's fine.

932
01:11:10,104 --> 01:11:14,441
Last time I saw him, he asked me how's
about you and this Geoffrey guy.

933
01:11:15,109 --> 01:11:18,779
Wanted to know what I thought
of long engagements.

934
01:11:19,113 --> 01:11:20,614
What do you think?

935
01:11:21,282 --> 01:11:22,950
I didn't tell him.

936
01:11:24,493 --> 01:11:26,120
Big of you.

937
01:11:27,163 --> 01:11:29,999
You look swell, Gil. In the money.

938
01:11:30,166 --> 01:11:31,750
Oh, I look swell, huh?

939
01:11:31,917 --> 01:11:37,089
Me in Palm Beach, in a 100-buck suit,
and Sheila Hale says I look swell.

940
01:11:37,673 --> 01:11:39,800
And it don't mean a thing.

941
01:11:42,678 --> 01:11:44,471
Look, Gil...

942
01:11:44,638 --> 01:11:46,974
...make out like it isn't Palm Beach.

943
01:11:47,141 --> 01:11:49,810
It's Coney Island, remember?

944
01:11:49,977 --> 01:11:51,187
No.

945
01:11:51,353 --> 01:11:54,356
It's Coney, and there's
a pretty good moon.

946
01:11:54,523 --> 01:11:56,192
And I let you kiss me.

947
01:11:56,358 --> 01:11:59,486
Only this time,
I won't even slap you once.

948
01:12:01,488 --> 01:12:03,991
It's still Palm Beach.

949
01:12:04,158 --> 01:12:06,535
So you want a little of both, huh?

950
01:12:06,702 --> 01:12:08,204
Me and the fur coats.

951
01:12:08,370 --> 01:12:12,333
Well, I could give you the fur coats
on my own now, but I don't want to.

952
01:12:12,500 --> 01:12:15,503
I thought I would, but I don't.

953
01:12:15,878 --> 01:12:18,380
So you've got over me, huh?

954
01:12:19,173 --> 01:12:22,176
Well, I'll believe you
when you kiss me goodbye.

955
01:12:25,679 --> 01:12:29,517
Wouldn't be that it's kind of tough to do,
would it?

956
01:12:38,692 --> 01:12:41,195
That wasn't any goodbye.

957
01:12:43,739 --> 01:12:47,034
Don't you know
when you've been turned down?

958
01:12:47,201 --> 01:12:49,370
I did.

959
01:12:59,588 --> 01:13:01,423
Sheila.

960
01:13:02,758 --> 01:13:04,885
Yes, Geoffrey?

961
01:13:07,596 --> 01:13:09,598
What do you think I did
with your winnings?

962
01:13:09,765 --> 01:13:12,101
Ran them up to 5000.

963
01:13:14,103 --> 01:13:18,107
- Oh, you're sweet, Geoffrey.
- Is that the word for it?

964
01:13:19,441 --> 01:13:23,237
- But you look tired.
- Maybe I'm getting old.

965
01:13:23,404 --> 01:13:27,950
Old wines are best, they say.
That is, them that drinks it say so.

966
01:13:28,117 --> 01:13:32,246
- Only I wouldn't know, would I?
- No, you wouldn't know.

967
01:13:37,918 --> 01:13:39,795
No, don't, Sheila.

968
01:13:39,962 --> 01:13:41,922
Why not?

969
01:13:42,298 --> 01:13:45,968
I get a bang out of you,
and you get a bang out of me.

970
01:13:46,135 --> 01:13:47,928
Sheila...

971
01:13:56,478 --> 01:14:01,275
Geoffrey, you said you had something
to tell me tonight, something important.

972
01:14:01,442 --> 01:14:03,777
I thought it was important,
but it isn't really.

973
01:14:03,944 --> 01:14:06,155
Maybe nothing ever is.

974
01:14:06,655 --> 01:14:09,700
You know what I'd like, on account
of me keeping my promise?

975
01:14:09,867 --> 01:14:11,118
What?

976
01:14:11,285 --> 01:14:14,330
A nice, long drink.

977
01:14:26,008 --> 01:14:28,511
Okay, break it up, break it up.
That's enough.

978
01:14:28,677 --> 01:14:30,971
And remember, we've got
an opening tonight...

979
01:14:31,138 --> 01:14:34,141
...so be back here on time
and all in one piece.

980
01:14:38,646 --> 01:14:41,899
Tonight's the night, your night.
But don't start worrying about it now.

981
01:14:42,066 --> 01:14:44,527
Oh, I wish Pop was here.
I wish my pop was here.

982
01:14:44,693 --> 01:14:47,321
I wish my doctor was here.

983
01:14:50,658 --> 01:14:52,034
Well, well, well.

984
01:14:52,201 --> 01:14:56,330
Oh, I sound like a crow with adenoids.

985
01:14:56,997 --> 01:15:00,709
Sandra, do girls' voices change too?

986
01:15:00,876 --> 01:15:03,671
Only for the better, baby.

987
01:15:04,380 --> 01:15:06,340
I hope you're right.

988
01:15:09,176 --> 01:15:13,055
Well, the town criers were right for once.

989
01:15:14,390 --> 01:15:16,684
You are beautiful.

990
01:15:17,434 --> 01:15:19,228
I'm Mrs. Frank Merton.

991
01:15:19,395 --> 01:15:22,857
- You knew Frank had a wife, didn't you?
- Of course. How do you do? I'm...

992
01:15:23,023 --> 01:15:24,859
And you're Sandra...

993
01:15:25,025 --> 01:15:27,903
...the current town topic,
the glamour gal of the year.

994
01:15:28,070 --> 01:15:30,072
You make me sound very silly.

995
01:15:30,239 --> 01:15:34,076
Sour grapes, my dear.
See, that's how they used to bill me.

996
01:15:34,243 --> 01:15:36,120
Doesn't Ziggy ever change this setup?

997
01:15:36,370 --> 01:15:40,583
I came down a stairway just like this
the year I won my Z.

998
01:15:41,709 --> 01:15:46,005
- But I'm not here for old home week, am I?
- Aren't you? Then why?

999
01:15:46,422 --> 01:15:49,717
Maybe to say, "Bless you, my children."

1000
01:15:50,134 --> 01:15:53,888
You know, I always wanted to play
a big scene sitting on one of these things.

1001
01:15:54,263 --> 01:15:56,974
What makes you think this is
going to be a big scene?

1002
01:15:57,266 --> 01:16:01,729
For one thing, I hear you're
going to marry my husband.

1003
01:16:03,230 --> 01:16:06,734
- You hear? From whom?
- From him.

1004
01:16:06,901 --> 01:16:10,613
He's crazy about you,
and I can see his point.

1005
01:16:11,238 --> 01:16:13,908
I'll make my sad story short,
if not sweet.

1006
01:16:14,074 --> 01:16:17,244
Frank and I have been married
for 10 years. Count them, 10.

1007
01:16:18,454 --> 01:16:21,790
I kicked my own career out
of the window to help Frank keep his.

1008
01:16:21,957 --> 01:16:23,792
And I don't regret it.

1009
01:16:23,959 --> 01:16:27,755
He's a great guy, in spots.

1010
01:16:27,922 --> 01:16:31,091
He's always played around a little,
and I've known it.

1011
01:16:31,800 --> 01:16:33,427
It wasn't fun knowing it...

1012
01:16:33,594 --> 01:16:37,765
...but I got by because he
always came home.

1013
01:16:39,308 --> 01:16:42,645
But it looks like he's not coming home
this time.

1014
01:16:45,439 --> 01:16:50,110
After seeing you, I know why
he wouldn't want to.

1015
01:16:52,488 --> 01:16:54,156
Mrs. Merton...

1016
01:16:54,990 --> 01:16:57,993
...you love him very much, don't you?

1017
01:16:58,160 --> 01:17:00,454
Probably not the way you do.

1018
01:17:01,121 --> 01:17:05,459
I love the way he thinks I like his singing
when I really don't, you know.

1019
01:17:06,293 --> 01:17:08,796
Do you ever listen to his speaking voice?

1020
01:17:08,963 --> 01:17:12,341
He can do more to me with that
than a Caruso.

1021
01:17:13,133 --> 01:17:16,136
I love the way he blames me
when he's got a cold...

1022
01:17:16,303 --> 01:17:18,138
...because then I laugh.

1023
01:17:18,305 --> 01:17:20,474
He never knows why.

1024
01:17:21,851 --> 01:17:26,355
And the funny way his hair curls up
off his neck when he needs a haircut.

1025
01:17:26,814 --> 01:17:30,025
And the way he grumbles
when the coffee's not just right.

1026
01:17:31,318 --> 01:17:34,989
And the way he makes you laugh
when you're just about to cry.

1027
01:17:36,490 --> 01:17:41,203
And all the crazy little things
that you think you'll change in him...

1028
01:17:41,370 --> 01:17:43,539
...but that really make him yours.

1029
01:17:45,332 --> 01:17:47,209
You're not talking about Frank.

1030
01:17:47,668 --> 01:17:49,879
No, I'm not...

1031
01:17:50,045 --> 01:17:54,508
...but we seem to be talking
about the same thing, don't we?

1032
01:17:57,011 --> 01:18:00,806
Maybe I'm the one to say,
"Bless you, my children."

1033
01:18:00,973 --> 01:18:03,851
We're the same kind of idiot, I guess.

1034
01:18:04,059 --> 01:18:06,729
I won't pretend I'm not glad.

1035
01:18:15,863 --> 01:18:17,740
Sandra.

1036
01:18:18,866 --> 01:18:21,035
Here is Franz's violin.

1037
01:18:21,202 --> 01:18:24,580
- Pawnbroker wept to see it go.
- Oh, Mischa.

1038
01:18:24,747 --> 01:18:28,834
All right, I'll do what you told me to,
but I don't like it.

1039
01:18:29,001 --> 01:18:32,922
I'll give the violin back to Franz...

1040
01:18:33,088 --> 01:18:37,885
...and I'll tell him that's your way
of saying goodbye. Is that it?

1041
01:18:38,052 --> 01:18:40,721
No, Mischa, no. That's all wrong.

1042
01:18:40,888 --> 01:18:45,601
- Why, are you crazy?
- I have been, but I'm not anymore.

1043
01:18:45,768 --> 01:18:48,229
Mischa, did something ever happen
to you...

1044
01:18:48,395 --> 01:18:50,940
...that all of a sudden,
made everything clear?

1045
01:18:51,106 --> 01:18:53,943
You knew what you wanted all at once.

1046
01:18:54,109 --> 01:18:59,240
Did that ever happen to you?
Like a hit on the head?

1047
01:18:59,615 --> 01:19:03,577
Not lately. I've been divorced for years.

1048
01:19:10,459 --> 01:19:11,919
Poor Mischa.

1049
01:19:12,086 --> 01:19:14,463
- What?
- I'm so sorry.

1050
01:19:14,630 --> 01:19:17,091
- Why?
- About your uncle.

1051
01:19:17,258 --> 01:19:21,428
- What uncle?
- The one in Philadelphia.

1052
01:19:21,637 --> 01:19:24,974
I have no uncle,
and he does not live in Philadelphia.

1053
01:19:25,140 --> 01:19:27,810
- Poor Mischa.
- What?

1054
01:19:27,977 --> 01:19:30,104
You'll probably lose your job...

1055
01:19:30,271 --> 01:19:35,442
...unless, of course, you have
a very good violinist to take your place...

1056
01:19:35,609 --> 01:19:38,612
...while you're in Philadelphia
for the funeral.

1057
01:19:40,322 --> 01:19:42,992
Sandra, what are you driving for?

1058
01:19:43,158 --> 01:19:46,328
You are crazy.
I tell you, you are crazy.

1059
01:19:46,495 --> 01:19:48,956
Oh, Mischa.

1060
01:19:49,123 --> 01:19:51,125
And so am I.

1061
01:19:51,292 --> 01:19:53,127
All right.

1062
01:19:53,294 --> 01:19:55,838
I've got an uncle.

1063
01:19:58,883 --> 01:20:01,385
- Hey, Grandpa, did you get Sheila?
- No, she wasn't there.

1064
01:20:01,552 --> 01:20:05,139
She's not here. Get out and find her.
Look in every speakeasy like a barfly.

1065
01:20:05,306 --> 01:20:08,017
- When I get hold of her, I'll...
- Kick her. Kick her hard.

1066
01:20:08,184 --> 01:20:09,810
But kick her where it won't show.

1067
01:20:09,977 --> 01:20:12,313
With that costume she wears,
it's impossible.

1068
01:20:14,190 --> 01:20:15,524
You have five minutes, miss.

1069
01:20:15,691 --> 01:20:17,985
Yeah, I'll have three left over.

1070
01:20:27,661 --> 01:20:31,707
Well? A gentleman gets up
when a lady comes into a room.

1071
01:20:31,874 --> 01:20:34,877
This is a room, all right.
I'm too busy to argue the rest of it.

1072
01:20:35,044 --> 01:20:37,046
Where do you get off
not wanting to see me?

1073
01:20:37,213 --> 01:20:39,924
A dumb truck driver in the clink
on account of bootlegging.

1074
01:20:40,090 --> 01:20:43,052
You've got the nerve to make me
practically break in to see you.

1075
01:20:43,219 --> 01:20:45,804
In the old days, when you got sore,
it used to bother me.

1076
01:20:45,971 --> 01:20:47,932
Look, I'm only trying to help you get out.

1077
01:20:48,098 --> 01:20:51,727
Yeah, and then when you used to go soft,
that bothered me more.

1078
01:20:51,894 --> 01:20:54,396
Oh, will you stop rolling those things?

1079
01:20:54,563 --> 01:20:57,441
They tell me I gotta learn
a trade where I'm going.

1080
01:20:58,025 --> 01:21:00,069
All right. Go ahead.

1081
01:21:00,236 --> 01:21:02,863
Take the rap for those crooks
you call your friends.

1082
01:21:03,030 --> 01:21:05,699
Your pal Nick Capalini.

1083
01:21:06,408 --> 01:21:09,078
Every racket's got its own
kind of payoff.

1084
01:21:14,375 --> 01:21:15,918
Look, why don't you get smart.

1085
01:21:16,085 --> 01:21:19,421
You can get out of this.
You can get a new trial.

1086
01:21:19,588 --> 01:21:22,383
You can do things in this town
if you know the right people.

1087
01:21:22,550 --> 01:21:27,054
Yeah, yeah. Only I don't. Do you?

1088
01:21:29,557 --> 01:21:32,726
I haven't seen Geoffrey Collis
for months.

1089
01:21:34,061 --> 01:21:36,397
I hear the guy walked out on you.

1090
01:21:36,564 --> 01:21:37,940
True or false?

1091
01:21:39,233 --> 01:21:40,860
True.

1092
01:21:42,862 --> 01:21:44,446
Gil?

1093
01:21:45,072 --> 01:21:47,283
Don't you honestly care about me
anymore?

1094
01:21:47,449 --> 01:21:48,951
Yeah, sure.

1095
01:21:49,118 --> 01:21:52,872
Only now I can roll a cigarette
while I tell you about it.

1096
01:21:55,124 --> 01:21:57,459
Could you believe that
I still care about you?

1097
01:21:57,626 --> 01:21:59,253
Yeah, why not?

1098
01:21:59,420 --> 01:22:02,298
And I can still roll a cigarette.

1099
01:22:04,466 --> 01:22:06,927
You know, it's a funny thing.

1100
01:22:07,094 --> 01:22:11,473
What's happened to you always happens to
people that try and be two places at once.

1101
01:22:12,099 --> 01:22:15,436
And they wind up not being anyplace.

1102
01:22:17,104 --> 01:22:18,647
Gil...

1103
01:22:18,814 --> 01:22:22,651
...Geoff would help us. He's a good guy.

1104
01:22:27,990 --> 01:22:30,117
Hey, bud, take me back
to my cell, will you?

1105
01:22:30,284 --> 01:22:34,330
- Okay.
- Guy can't live very long on no fresh air.

1106
01:22:39,502 --> 01:22:42,963
- Hey, what's going on in here?
- Where can a lady get a drink?

1107
01:22:43,130 --> 01:22:46,300
There's a little joint around the corner.
Good liquor too.

1108
01:22:46,509 --> 01:22:48,177
Thanks.

1109
01:22:52,640 --> 01:22:54,767
Theater's been calling you all afternoon.

1110
01:22:54,934 --> 01:22:57,686
Wants to know why you wasn't there
for dress rehearsals.

1111
01:22:58,312 --> 01:23:03,317
I can walk down a flight of steps tonight
without rehearsing all afternoon, I guess.

1112
01:23:05,528 --> 01:23:08,364
- Pour me a drink, will you, Annie?
- Sure.

1113
01:23:08,531 --> 01:23:10,616
Guess I'm a little low.

1114
01:23:10,783 --> 01:23:12,368
You're up, you're down.

1115
01:23:12,535 --> 01:23:14,995
What is this, a prize fight?

1116
01:23:15,162 --> 01:23:18,541
Don't you know I'm never down?
I'm always up.

1117
01:23:18,707 --> 01:23:21,669
Geoffrey likes me that way.

1118
01:23:22,336 --> 01:23:24,171
Pardon me.

1119
01:23:24,463 --> 01:23:26,215
Used to like.

1120
01:23:27,299 --> 01:23:30,678
I forgot. Your kid brother's in there.
Been hanging around about an hour.

1121
01:23:30,845 --> 01:23:32,054
- Jerry?
- Yeah.

1122
01:23:32,221 --> 01:23:34,348
Why didn't you tell me?

1123
01:23:40,062 --> 01:23:42,857
Well, hello, big boy.

1124
01:23:44,358 --> 01:23:47,903
- What are you doing east of Broadway?
- Kind of wanted to see you.

1125
01:24:00,749 --> 01:24:03,878
I gotta talk to you, Sheila.
It's important.

1126
01:24:04,044 --> 01:24:05,880
All right.

1127
01:24:08,716 --> 01:24:11,427
What's the matter?
Smash up your new car?

1128
01:24:11,594 --> 01:24:14,221
No, I took it back.

1129
01:24:14,930 --> 01:24:17,433
Well, how about the music lessons?

1130
01:24:17,600 --> 01:24:20,895
I quit them. I got a job.

1131
01:24:21,896 --> 01:24:24,732
Not on a truck, by any chance?

1132
01:24:24,899 --> 01:24:26,400
No.

1133
01:24:26,567 --> 01:24:29,361
I got a job in a pool hall.

1134
01:24:34,241 --> 01:24:38,454
Sheila, I'm getting too old to let a woman
put up for cars and music lessons for me.

1135
01:24:40,623 --> 01:24:42,416
Is your old age the only reason?

1136
01:24:44,627 --> 01:24:46,587
What else?

1137
01:24:51,926 --> 01:24:55,638
Gosh, Sheila, I don't believe a word
of what they're saying.

1138
01:24:55,804 --> 01:24:57,640
Who's saying what about who?

1139
01:24:57,806 --> 01:25:01,435
Oh, them cats that hang
over the fences in every back yard.

1140
01:25:01,644 --> 01:25:03,771
Well, that's who.

1141
01:25:03,938 --> 01:25:06,148
Now let's have the what.

1142
01:25:06,315 --> 01:25:09,276
Things I wouldn't repeat
in front of a lady.

1143
01:25:09,443 --> 01:25:10,653
Thanks.

1144
01:25:10,819 --> 01:25:12,821
- Things about me?
- Yeah.

1145
01:25:12,988 --> 01:25:16,951
And it's sure got me on the jump
keeping it from the folks too.

1146
01:25:18,661 --> 01:25:22,456
So you don't believe it...

1147
01:25:22,623 --> 01:25:25,668
...the folks don't even hear it.

1148
01:25:29,171 --> 01:25:32,842
- Did Dad send you here?
- He don't know nothing about this.

1149
01:25:33,008 --> 01:25:35,970
Listen, Sheila, I know you got
a nice place here...

1150
01:25:36,136 --> 01:25:38,639
...and that you never cared
for it much in Brooklyn.

1151
01:25:38,806 --> 01:25:40,975
But if you could just come
home to live, maybe...

1152
01:25:41,141 --> 01:25:43,978
- I might stop those cats from meowing?
- Well, yes.

1153
01:25:44,144 --> 01:25:46,814
That'd make it okay again
about the car and music lessons?

1154
01:25:46,981 --> 01:25:48,190
You know I don't mean that.

1155
01:25:48,357 --> 01:25:50,651
We don't want anything
except having you around.

1156
01:25:50,818 --> 01:25:52,486
And I'm supposed to believe that!

1157
01:25:52,653 --> 01:25:55,197
You've taken things from me
for months, all of you!

1158
01:25:55,364 --> 01:25:57,700
- It was the same then, only more so.
- But listen...

1159
01:25:57,867 --> 01:26:00,202
Now I gotta go home
to cover up for the neighbors!

1160
01:26:00,369 --> 01:26:03,873
You're yelling me down. The louder
you yell, the less you got to yell about.

1161
01:26:04,039 --> 01:26:06,584
People aren't talking any more now
than they were then.

1162
01:26:06,750 --> 01:26:09,962
If I was good enough to support you then,
I'm bad enough to stop now.

1163
01:26:10,129 --> 01:26:13,841
If you ask me, I think Gil's the one
that's really got something to yell about.

1164
01:26:15,176 --> 01:26:19,847
All right. Let Dad take care of you,
like he used to, working his heart out.

1165
01:26:20,014 --> 01:26:23,517
Have the rent collector on your neck
and no new dresses for Ma.

1166
01:26:23,684 --> 01:26:25,394
You hanging around pool halls.

1167
01:26:25,561 --> 01:26:27,563
And Betty growing up to run an elevator.

1168
01:26:27,855 --> 01:26:30,733
You were all right
till you stopped running one.

1169
01:26:30,900 --> 01:26:32,401
Okay.

1170
01:26:32,568 --> 01:26:36,071
You do it your way.
Only let me alone!

1171
01:26:36,238 --> 01:26:38,240
Let me do it my way.

1172
01:26:38,407 --> 01:26:40,701
Now get out!

1173
01:26:40,868 --> 01:26:42,703
Go on!

1174
01:26:44,205 --> 01:26:45,915
All right.

1175
01:26:57,426 --> 01:26:59,053
Here.

1176
01:27:00,763 --> 01:27:02,389
You think of everything, don't you?

1177
01:27:02,556 --> 01:27:04,767
Show opens in a couple of hours.
Get some rest.

1178
01:27:04,934 --> 01:27:07,394
What for? I'm full of pep.

1179
01:27:07,561 --> 01:27:10,064
I'm always full of pep.

1180
01:27:10,231 --> 01:27:12,733
Always full anyway.

1181
01:27:16,403 --> 01:27:18,113
Annie...

1182
01:27:18,280 --> 01:27:20,241
...how many fur coats have I got?

1183
01:27:20,407 --> 01:27:24,453
Well, counting that new ermine, six.

1184
01:27:24,620 --> 01:27:27,456
Yeah, and how many of these
service stripes have we collected?

1185
01:27:27,623 --> 01:27:31,794
Adding Mr. Geoff's signing-off present
and deducting that one we pawned...

1186
01:27:31,961 --> 01:27:34,421
...I make seven.
- Seven.

1187
01:27:34,588 --> 01:27:37,591
Think of it. I'm a very lucky girl.

1188
01:27:37,758 --> 01:27:42,429
Six fur coats, seven diamond bracelets,
an apartment on Park Avenue...

1189
01:27:42,638 --> 01:27:45,975
- What are you trying to do to yourself?
- What am I trying to do?

1190
01:27:46,141 --> 01:27:49,937
Don't you know?
I'm counting my blessings, Annie.

1191
01:27:50,104 --> 01:27:54,441
Counting my blessings!

1192
01:28:00,489 --> 01:28:03,450
Overture. Overture.

1193
01:28:03,617 --> 01:28:04,827
Overture.

1194
01:28:04,994 --> 01:28:10,416
- It's too bad about Mischa's uncle, isn't it?
- Yes. It's too bad about most people.

1195
01:28:42,323 --> 01:28:46,327
Little Patsy's picture's out of the lobby,
and little Patsy's out of the show.

1196
01:28:46,493 --> 01:28:50,706
And this is the first time in five years
I haven't been the June bride.

1197
01:28:55,002 --> 01:28:57,546
But don't fret, Jenny. Patsy's okay.

1198
01:28:57,713 --> 01:29:02,009
You know, I think I'll settle down
and adopt a baby, a boy about 21.

1199
01:29:02,176 --> 01:29:06,514
There's nothing wrong with Patsy
a good marriage won't fix, eh, Flatbush?

1200
01:29:06,680 --> 01:29:09,183
Places for the Trinidad number.

1201
01:29:10,518 --> 01:29:14,355
Where do you think you're going? Slayton
told you to stay off. You're plastered.

1202
01:29:14,522 --> 01:29:16,565
Sure I am. And a beautiful pink.

1203
01:29:16,732 --> 01:29:20,361
- Listen, you're leading with your chin.
- Yeah? Who are you to talk?

1204
01:29:20,528 --> 01:29:22,821
The best horrible example
you'll ever see.

1205
01:29:22,988 --> 01:29:26,033
Yeah, I know I look funny
on a soapbox...

1206
01:29:26,200 --> 01:29:29,870
...but you're so darn much like
I used to be. I hate to see you...

1207
01:29:30,037 --> 01:29:32,248
Listen, honey, being a Ziegfeld girl
is swell...

1208
01:29:32,414 --> 01:29:35,042
...but at most, it's only a few years
out of a lifetime.

1209
01:29:35,209 --> 01:29:37,086
And what are you gonna have after that?

1210
01:29:37,253 --> 01:29:40,589
I'd give my right arm,
yeah, and everything on it...

1211
01:29:40,756 --> 01:29:44,760
...for a guy with an ice-cream wagon,
if he really loved me.

1212
01:29:44,927 --> 01:29:47,263
And you've got a guy with a truck.

1213
01:29:47,429 --> 01:29:48,931
Come on back, honey.

1214
01:29:49,098 --> 01:29:51,976
Back to what?

1215
01:32:54,283 --> 01:32:55,659
Why didn't somebody stop her?

1216
01:32:55,826 --> 01:32:58,913
I don't know. I just opened my eyes,
and there she was.

1217
01:43:30,044 --> 01:43:31,837
- Are you all right?
- Leave me alone!

1218
01:43:32,004 --> 01:43:34,590
- You better go on the wagon.
- You better take the pledge.

1219
01:43:34,757 --> 01:43:36,634
I'm all right.

1220
01:43:38,636 --> 01:43:41,138
- Didn't I tell you not to go on?
- Well, l...

1221
01:43:41,305 --> 01:43:43,432
Sure, sure. That's right.
Here, Jenny.

1222
01:43:43,599 --> 01:43:46,519
Pour her back in that bottle
and send her home for good.

1223
01:43:46,685 --> 01:43:51,524
Come on, kids. Don't be so nosy. Make
your change for the next act. Hurry up!

1224
01:43:51,690 --> 01:43:55,736
Gosh! How can a girl
do that to her career?

1225
01:43:55,903 --> 01:43:57,905
How can a girl do that to herself?

1226
01:43:58,113 --> 01:44:00,241
Poor Sheila.

1227
01:44:03,160 --> 01:44:04,829
Sandra!

1228
01:44:08,249 --> 01:44:10,167
Franz.

1229
01:44:12,753 --> 01:44:14,755
Oh, Franz!

1230
01:44:18,008 --> 01:44:21,846
- Sandra.
- Very good, my boy. Very good.

1231
01:44:22,012 --> 01:44:24,265
See you in Carnegie Hall.

1232
01:44:25,307 --> 01:44:26,934
Did he say Carnegie Hall?

1233
01:44:27,142 --> 01:44:30,896
Yes. Why not?
Wear this for luck, darling.

1234
01:44:42,324 --> 01:44:44,952
Orders is orders.
But if you ask me, honey...

1235
01:44:45,160 --> 01:44:49,915
...you looked better falling down them stairs
than the rest of them do strutting down.

1236
01:44:56,338 --> 01:44:59,258
Do you suppose Prohibition
will ever get around to sodas?

1237
01:44:59,425 --> 01:45:02,428
I'm sorry it never got around to alcohol.

1238
01:45:04,388 --> 01:45:06,515
You heard from Sheila yet, Jerry?

1239
01:45:06,682 --> 01:45:11,562
Nothing but a loud popping of corks,
and we can't seem to track them down.

1240
01:45:11,729 --> 01:45:14,648
How about your dad?

1241
01:45:14,815 --> 01:45:17,902
He's still knocking them stiff in Omaha.

1242
01:45:18,068 --> 01:45:20,321
That is, stiffer than they were.

1243
01:45:28,370 --> 01:45:30,664
I almost forgot.

1244
01:45:31,582 --> 01:45:34,960
Funny, I didn't.

1245
01:45:41,383 --> 01:45:44,261
- Pinning a blue ribbon on me?
- Why not?

1246
01:45:44,428 --> 01:45:47,181
Aren't you the best of your class?

1247
01:46:00,319 --> 01:46:02,613
I'm sorry, miss. It's a phony.

1248
01:46:04,156 --> 01:46:06,659
I'll give you $ 10 for the setting.

1249
01:46:08,202 --> 01:46:10,287
Ten dollars?

1250
01:46:12,289 --> 01:46:15,751
Well, what am I kicking about?

1251
01:46:40,192 --> 01:46:42,611
I never thought you'd
quit the show, beautiful.

1252
01:46:42,778 --> 01:46:46,240
You can't do this to me, honey.
I got my pride.

1253
01:46:46,448 --> 01:46:49,326
What's this longhaired husband
of yours got that I ain't got?

1254
01:46:49,493 --> 01:46:50,995
A fiddle.

1255
01:46:58,210 --> 01:46:59,962
Well, now I've heard everything!

1256
01:47:00,129 --> 01:47:03,924
You're walking out on a Ziegfeld
contract to do an act in Hoboken.

1257
01:47:04,091 --> 01:47:05,676
Well there's nothing else I can do.

1258
01:47:05,843 --> 01:47:07,928
I've got a name now.
We can get bookings.

1259
01:47:08,095 --> 01:47:12,099
Isn't there any other way of helping your
pop without cutting your throat so publicly?

1260
01:47:12,725 --> 01:47:14,268
Try and see it his way.

1261
01:47:14,435 --> 01:47:18,480
He's worked all his life to be what he is,
and if he can't go on believing in that...

1262
01:47:18,647 --> 01:47:19,690
...what's he got?

1263
01:47:19,940 --> 01:47:22,610
Why don't you hire him
as your instructor or something.

1264
01:47:22,818 --> 01:47:24,486
And then don't listen to him.

1265
01:47:24,820 --> 01:47:27,031
I've tried that.
He knows it's a phony.

1266
01:47:27,198 --> 01:47:29,783
Then pension him off.
Put him out to pasture somewhere.

1267
01:47:29,950 --> 01:47:32,828
You're talking about my pop,
not a fire horse.

1268
01:47:32,995 --> 01:47:35,164
Get him a little job. Anything.

1269
01:47:36,165 --> 01:47:38,626
Like in the Follies, maybe.

1270
01:47:38,834 --> 01:47:41,629
- Oh, Mr. Sage!
- No, Mr. Sage!

1271
01:47:41,795 --> 01:47:44,798
It would be wonderful! Can't you
see how wonderful it would be?

1272
01:47:45,007 --> 01:47:48,928
- For who?
- For everybody! Pop would wow them!

1273
01:47:49,470 --> 01:47:52,640
- Anyway, I'd like him.
- Send Pop around to see Slayton.

1274
01:47:52,806 --> 01:47:56,519
Send him?
Why, he's waiting right outside.

1275
01:47:58,020 --> 01:48:00,397
- We were on our way to Hoboken.
- Well, bring him in!

1276
01:48:00,564 --> 01:48:02,233
And leave Hoboken where it is.

1277
01:48:02,900 --> 01:48:07,530
Might be easier to bring Hoboken here.
Pop's got a mind of his own.

1278
01:48:08,030 --> 01:48:12,117
You know, honestly, Mr. Sage,
I don't think I noticed it before...

1279
01:48:12,284 --> 01:48:15,830
...but I guess that you're really one
of the great men of the century.

1280
01:48:17,039 --> 01:48:19,416
The century is still young.

1281
01:48:19,750 --> 01:48:22,127
We couldn't let our star attraction
walk out on us.

1282
01:48:22,294 --> 01:48:24,213
You're paying a bitter price
to keep her.

1283
01:48:24,380 --> 01:48:27,007
That old guy smells with lace on,
and you know it.

1284
01:48:27,174 --> 01:48:32,680
- We'd have to fumigate after every show.
- No. Just after the first performance, pal.

1285
01:48:35,224 --> 01:48:38,602
Stick him in on the opening night.
Put him in front of a drop in one.

1286
01:48:38,769 --> 01:48:41,021
Give him two minutes.
Next night, he isn't there.

1287
01:48:41,230 --> 01:48:44,400
And the kid's with him in Hoboken.

1288
01:48:44,567 --> 01:48:46,694
Well, I'll have to think
of an answer to that.

1289
01:48:52,867 --> 01:48:55,286
- Hello, kid.
- Hello, Joe.

1290
01:48:57,997 --> 01:49:01,458
That nag looks like a cinch in the fifth.
Let's see that sheet.

1291
01:49:12,344 --> 01:49:14,805
Brandy, George.
Give it a twin.

1292
01:49:14,972 --> 01:49:17,308
Cash or credit, Miss Hale?

1293
01:49:18,893 --> 01:49:21,145
- Well...
- I'm sorry, but the boss says no.

1294
01:49:21,312 --> 01:49:23,063
No more credit.

1295
01:49:23,272 --> 01:49:25,191
Two Manhattans.

1296
01:49:25,608 --> 01:49:28,194
Good try anyway, kid.

1297
01:49:31,197 --> 01:49:33,115
Jimmy Walters.

1298
01:49:34,366 --> 01:49:38,078
- Remember?
- How could I forget?

1299
01:49:38,245 --> 01:49:41,248
- Seen you when you done it.
- Yeah.

1300
01:49:44,293 --> 01:49:47,296
You look like you got a different kind
of headache these days.

1301
01:49:47,588 --> 01:49:48,964
Yeah.

1302
01:49:49,507 --> 01:49:51,884
You look good and defrosted.

1303
01:49:52,051 --> 01:49:53,552
Yeah...

1304
01:49:53,719 --> 01:49:56,847
...but you're still on ice.
You know what I mean?

1305
01:49:57,932 --> 01:50:01,894
I got enough left for a couple of beers
if you can stand the old ear.

1306
01:50:05,523 --> 01:50:07,483
Okay, champ.

1307
01:50:08,275 --> 01:50:10,152
Couple of beers.

1308
01:50:10,986 --> 01:50:12,279
Draw two.

1309
01:50:13,197 --> 01:50:16,575
They got booths in this dump for ladies.

1310
01:50:36,595 --> 01:50:38,305
Two beers.

1311
01:50:58,075 --> 01:50:59,535
Now...

1312
01:51:02,496 --> 01:51:05,791
...when I was a champ, you gave me
the fisheye and a lot of fast lip.

1313
01:51:06,876 --> 01:51:11,005
Now I'm a tramp, you're willing to drink
my beer because you're a tramp too.

1314
01:51:12,548 --> 01:51:16,927
The only difference between you
and me is, you was a tramp then.

1315
01:51:17,636 --> 01:51:19,972
I'm not that thirsty.

1316
01:51:20,139 --> 01:51:23,142
The winner and still champion!

1317
01:51:26,228 --> 01:51:30,107
And still hitting...

1318
01:51:30,274 --> 01:51:33,527
...below the belt.

1319
01:51:40,284 --> 01:51:42,745
Somebody give me a hand! Quick!
Hurry up! Somebody!

1320
01:51:42,912 --> 01:51:45,456
Somebody come here, quick! Hurry up!

1321
01:51:48,042 --> 01:51:51,378
When you're through,
Sheila wants the paper.

1322
01:51:51,587 --> 01:51:55,007
- I was only looking at the stock market.
- See who it is.

1323
01:51:58,052 --> 01:52:00,971
- Hello, Gil. How are you?
- Hello, Jerry.

1324
01:52:01,138 --> 01:52:04,350
Gil, we're so glad to see you back.

1325
01:52:04,517 --> 01:52:06,060
Sheila will want to see you.

1326
01:52:06,227 --> 01:52:09,021
- Wait a minute. I'll tell her you're here.
- Fine.

1327
01:52:09,855 --> 01:52:13,067
- Boy, Gil, how's it feel to be out?
- How's it feel to be in?

1328
01:52:13,275 --> 01:52:14,860
- All right.
- What'd the doc say?

1329
01:52:15,027 --> 01:52:19,406
- You didn't give much over the phone.
- Well, Sheila's a little run-down.

1330
01:52:19,573 --> 01:52:22,576
- She's gotta stay in bed a couple of days.
- How long?

1331
01:52:22,785 --> 01:52:25,496
Well, a couple of weeks.

1332
01:52:25,663 --> 01:52:30,125
You're not a very good liar, are you, kid?
Your tie is crooked.

1333
01:52:30,292 --> 01:52:32,253
She ain't so good at all, Gil.

1334
01:52:32,419 --> 01:52:34,880
Doctor says her heart
just ain't there anymore.

1335
01:52:35,089 --> 01:52:37,174
All right, Gil.

1336
01:52:38,801 --> 01:52:41,470
Gil, Sheila don't know how it is.

1337
01:52:41,637 --> 01:52:45,224
Nobody does but me. Now you.

1338
01:52:53,482 --> 01:52:56,777
Well, nurse, how's the patient?
Giving you any trouble?

1339
01:52:56,986 --> 01:53:00,239
She won't take her soup.
Says it's not on her diet.

1340
01:53:00,406 --> 01:53:04,368
You better run along. Time somebody
took charge around here.

1341
01:53:04,535 --> 01:53:06,996
Won't eat the soup, huh?

1342
01:53:07,163 --> 01:53:09,498
Well, yeah.

1343
01:53:11,292 --> 01:53:15,337
It's too good for her. Here.
You better have a bib.

1344
01:53:17,840 --> 01:53:19,925
Now open the kisser.

1345
01:53:26,557 --> 01:53:27,808
Hello, Red.

1346
01:53:29,268 --> 01:53:31,270
Hello, Gil.

1347
01:53:32,646 --> 01:53:34,190
I got your flowers.

1348
01:53:35,399 --> 01:53:36,942
How'd you know
they were from me?

1349
01:53:37,693 --> 01:53:41,363
Well, who else would send a girl
roses wrapped in butcher paper?

1350
01:53:41,530 --> 01:53:43,532
Oh, yeah. Yeah.

1351
01:53:46,243 --> 01:53:47,953
There you are.

1352
01:53:51,707 --> 01:53:55,127
How's your pal Capalini?

1353
01:53:55,377 --> 01:53:56,712
Oh, well...

1354
01:53:56,879 --> 01:54:00,049
...when I came out of the clink,
I passed him going in.

1355
01:54:00,216 --> 01:54:02,009
We nodded.

1356
01:54:02,259 --> 01:54:05,179
That could mean a lot of things.

1357
01:54:05,346 --> 01:54:09,099
"Hello. Goodbye.
See you next year..."

1358
01:54:09,266 --> 01:54:12,019
Yeah. Yeah. It can also mean,
"I'm glad to have met you."

1359
01:54:12,186 --> 01:54:14,939
Or, "Go break your legs."

1360
01:54:21,987 --> 01:54:25,407
What did you miss most in jail, Gil?

1361
01:54:25,574 --> 01:54:27,201
Beer.

1362
01:54:29,870 --> 01:54:31,789
What next?

1363
01:54:32,540 --> 01:54:34,208
Dames.

1364
01:54:35,918 --> 01:54:38,504
Any dame in particular?

1365
01:54:38,671 --> 01:54:43,050
Oh, yeah. Yeah. Three or four.
Very particular.

1366
01:54:43,300 --> 01:54:48,806
Well, did it ever narrow down?

1367
01:54:49,765 --> 01:54:51,392
Yeah.

1368
01:54:53,602 --> 01:54:55,062
Yeah.

1369
01:54:57,940 --> 01:55:00,693
To a razor edge.

1370
01:55:00,860 --> 01:55:02,444
Anyone I'd know?

1371
01:55:02,611 --> 01:55:04,905
Well, very slightly.

1372
01:55:06,615 --> 01:55:08,868
Oh, Red.

1373
01:55:16,625 --> 01:55:20,129
I'm still in that elevator...

1374
01:55:20,296 --> 01:55:22,047
...going down.

1375
01:55:22,214 --> 01:55:26,927
I'm right with you, Red,
only I'm going up.

1376
01:55:28,429 --> 01:55:30,222
Gil...

1377
01:55:30,389 --> 01:55:33,934
...we're gonna have so much
to tell our grandkids.

1378
01:55:36,312 --> 01:55:38,606
Or maybe we'd better
skip some of it, huh?

1379
01:55:39,607 --> 01:55:41,150
Yeah. Yeah.

1380
01:55:41,317 --> 01:55:43,611
Kids gotta have some respect for us.

1381
01:55:43,777 --> 01:55:48,782
Sure. We wouldn't want them to think
that we were just a couple of dopes...

1382
01:55:48,991 --> 01:55:52,203
...that met at a roller coaster.
- No. No.

1383
01:55:52,369 --> 01:55:54,830
We won't tell them nothing
except about the ducks.

1384
01:55:56,457 --> 01:56:01,003
- What ducks?
- Genuine, milk-fed, sugar-cured...

1385
01:56:01,170 --> 01:56:05,966
...aluminum-coated, predigested
Long Island ducks.

1386
01:56:06,550 --> 01:56:09,470
You know the kind that
are always on the menus?

1387
01:56:09,637 --> 01:56:11,222
I don't like ducks.

1388
01:56:11,388 --> 01:56:15,768
They won't like you very much when
they find out you're raising them for menus.

1389
01:56:16,852 --> 01:56:20,481
- Am I raising ducks?
- We're raising ducks.

1390
01:56:20,689 --> 01:56:22,650
Beginning day before yesterday.

1391
01:56:22,858 --> 01:56:25,319
Red, there's a fortune in it.

1392
01:56:25,528 --> 01:56:28,531
Well, it's a living anyway.

1393
01:56:29,615 --> 01:56:32,034
Will they be yellow ducks?

1394
01:56:33,702 --> 01:56:36,539
Because if it's gotta be ducks...

1395
01:56:36,705 --> 01:56:39,959
...I want little, yellow, fuzzy ones.
- Okay.

1396
01:56:40,125 --> 01:56:43,420
If they don't come in yellow,
I'll paint them for you.

1397
01:56:46,757 --> 01:56:49,093
Of course, I don't believe
a word of this.

1398
01:56:49,260 --> 01:56:51,220
A word of what, honey?

1399
01:56:51,387 --> 01:56:53,055
What's happening.

1400
01:56:54,098 --> 01:56:58,561
It's too good for me, like Mom's soup.

1401
01:56:59,019 --> 01:57:01,689
There's nothing too good for you, Red.

1402
01:57:03,023 --> 01:57:04,400
Gil?

1403
01:57:04,567 --> 01:57:08,529
- Do you still have the wedding license?
- Oh, yeah.

1404
01:57:11,740 --> 01:57:13,826
It ran out.

1405
01:57:14,118 --> 01:57:17,496
- The poor little thing.
- Well, I can get a new one, though.

1406
01:57:17,663 --> 01:57:21,625
No. I like this one.

1407
01:57:27,548 --> 01:57:29,967
Look, Red, you'd better rest now.

1408
01:57:32,052 --> 01:57:33,512
I feel fine.

1409
01:57:33,679 --> 01:57:36,765
- I'm not tired.
- No, now look, I'm taking over here.

1410
01:57:39,226 --> 01:57:42,980
- Put that over here.
- Gil?

1411
01:57:45,274 --> 01:57:50,279
Gil, how far away from 42nd Street...

1412
01:57:50,446 --> 01:57:53,782
...would you be if you had a duck farm?

1413
01:57:56,035 --> 01:57:58,496
An hour or two maybe.

1414
01:57:58,662 --> 01:58:02,625
That's not very far
if you happen to like ducks, is it?

1415
01:58:02,958 --> 01:58:09,298
And it's not very far to get back if
you happen to like other things too...

1416
01:58:09,465 --> 01:58:11,967
...like 42nd Street.

1417
01:58:14,929 --> 01:58:17,932
You know, don't you, Gil?

1418
01:58:18,724 --> 01:58:21,477
You know what's wrong with me.

1419
01:58:23,062 --> 01:58:24,355
I'm two people.

1420
01:58:25,314 --> 01:58:28,108
And that just makes you twice
as good as anybody else, Red.

1421
01:58:28,275 --> 01:58:29,485
No, Gil.

1422
01:58:31,153 --> 01:58:33,197
I'm two people.

1423
01:58:34,406 --> 01:58:39,829
- Neither one of them is any good.
- You're all right, Red. You're all right.

1424
01:58:40,162 --> 01:58:42,790
Maybe you got mixed up
in the wrong business for a while.

1425
01:58:42,998 --> 01:58:45,125
But that's not it, Gil.

1426
01:58:46,752 --> 01:58:50,714
The Follies didn't hurt
Sandra and Susan.

1427
01:58:51,757 --> 01:58:54,593
Slayton told us.

1428
01:58:55,010 --> 01:58:58,389
He said that the same things
would happen to us...

1429
01:58:58,556 --> 01:59:02,518
...even if we were still where
Mr. Ziegfeld found us...

1430
01:59:04,103 --> 01:59:06,689
...that it was strictly up to us.

1431
01:59:11,861 --> 01:59:14,071
You know something, Gil?

1432
01:59:15,531 --> 01:59:17,199
I'll hate to miss
this opening night.

1433
01:59:21,787 --> 01:59:23,831
You just go to sleep.

1434
01:59:24,039 --> 01:59:26,667
Dream about the ducks, huh?

1435
01:59:26,876 --> 01:59:28,669
And this?

1436
01:59:30,462 --> 01:59:32,089
Yeah.

1437
01:59:38,220 --> 01:59:39,972
I love you, Red.

1438
01:59:41,432 --> 01:59:44,018
Put that in your dream too, will you?

1439
02:00:33,234 --> 02:00:35,444
Come on, girls. Hurry up.
Make your change.

1440
02:00:35,611 --> 02:00:39,073
Don't worry, Pop. Take it easy.
Look them in the eye like they were tigers.

1441
02:00:39,281 --> 02:00:41,116
- lf you lay an egg, do me a favor.
- What?

1442
02:00:41,283 --> 02:00:43,410
Cackle. That will be my signal
to catch a boat.

1443
02:00:43,619 --> 02:00:47,915
Say, boy, run out and get a double Bromo.
And split it between the two of you.

1444
02:00:48,082 --> 02:00:50,209
Hey! There's your music.
Where's Al? You're on.

1445
02:00:50,376 --> 02:00:52,878
Don't worry. He can smell a cue
from here to breakfast.

1446
02:00:53,087 --> 02:00:56,882
Hold her for me. If you find her slipping,
rub her head against yours. It's lucky.

1447
02:00:57,049 --> 02:00:58,634
- When did the Follies start?
- 1907.

1448
02:00:58,801 --> 02:01:01,887
For the first time, they're gonna
get their money's worth. Come on.

1449
02:01:04,557 --> 02:01:06,058
Gee! Am I too late?

1450
02:01:06,225 --> 02:01:08,143
- Yeah. To stop them.
- How's Sheila, Jerry?

1451
02:01:08,310 --> 02:01:09,562
She's gonna be okay.

1452
02:01:19,363 --> 02:01:23,242
{y:i}It's Mr. Gallagher
{y:i}It's Mr. Gallagher

1453
02:01:23,409 --> 02:01:27,329
{y:i}As I live
{y:i}Why, it's my old pal Mr. Shean

1454
02:01:27,496 --> 02:01:30,875
- {y:i}How long have you been here?
- {y:i}I've been over here a year

1455
02:01:31,041 --> 02:01:34,295
{y:i}It's the strangest country
{y:i}That I've ever seen

1456
02:01:34,503 --> 02:01:38,299
{y:i}Oh, Mr. Shean
{y:i}Oh, Mr. Shean

1457
02:01:38,465 --> 02:01:41,760
{y:i}Over here
{y:i}Why, we can both live European

1458
02:01:41,927 --> 02:01:44,054
- {y:i}Yes?
- {y:i}Ride around on camels' backs

1459
02:01:44,221 --> 02:01:46,015
{y:i}And we'll pay no income tax

1460
02:01:46,182 --> 02:01:49,768
- {y:i}Positively, Mr. Gallagher
- {y:i}Absolutely, Mr. Shean

1461
02:01:58,694 --> 02:02:00,946
But it's in the balcony.

1462
02:02:01,238 --> 02:02:02,740
Oh, that's fine, Ted.

1463
02:02:02,907 --> 02:02:07,411
Oh, no, I couldn't let you pay
for a ticket. Mr. Ziegfeld wouldn't like it.

1464
02:02:10,956 --> 02:02:12,666
Thanks.

1465
02:02:21,050 --> 02:02:24,303
{y:i}Mr. Gallagher
{y:i}Mr. Gallagher

1466
02:02:24,470 --> 02:02:28,307
{y:i}I understand one day
{y:i}You saved a lady's life

1467
02:02:28,474 --> 02:02:32,186
{y:i}In a rowboat out at sea
{y:i}You were a hero then to me

1468
02:02:32,394 --> 02:02:35,523
{y:i}Someone said that
{y:i}You had made this girl your wife

1469
02:02:35,689 --> 02:02:39,360
{y:i}Oh, Mr. Shean
{y:i}Oh, Mr. Shean

1470
02:02:39,568 --> 02:02:43,155
{y:i}When she sank
{y:i}I dove down like a submarine

1471
02:02:43,322 --> 02:02:46,867
{y:i}Dragged her out upon the shore
{y:i}Now she's mine forevermore.

1472
02:02:47,076 --> 02:02:51,163
- {y:i}Who, the lady, Mr. Gallagher?
- {y:i}No, the rowboat, Mr. Shean

1473
02:02:54,750 --> 02:02:58,420
- Could it be that we're wrong?
- It's happened before.

1474
02:03:00,840 --> 02:03:04,552
{y:i}Oh, Mr. Gallagher
{y:i}Mr. Gallagher

1475
02:03:04,760 --> 02:03:08,013
{y:i}At the Follies
{y:i}You will see some wonderful sights

1476
02:03:08,180 --> 02:03:12,101
{y:i}Are you the redhead on the end?
{y:i}I'd like to be your friend

1477
02:03:12,268 --> 02:03:15,479
{y:i}How about a little date with me tonight?

1478
02:03:15,646 --> 02:03:19,275
{y:i}Oh, Mr. Shean
{y:i}Oh, Mr. Shean

1479
02:03:19,441 --> 02:03:22,444
{y:i}Why, you haven't got a look-in
{y:i}With that queen

1480
02:03:22,611 --> 02:03:25,114
- {y:i}Why not?
- {y:i}She has millionaires untold

1481
02:03:25,281 --> 02:03:26,907
{y:i}Who have lavished her with gold

1482
02:03:27,074 --> 02:03:31,871
- {y:i}To keep her friendship, Mr. Gallagher?
- {y:i}To keep her mouth shut, Mr. Shean

1483
02:03:34,331 --> 02:03:37,835
{y:i}Oh, Mr. Gallagher
{y:i}Mr. Gallagher

1484
02:03:38,002 --> 02:03:41,589
- {y:i}Today I paid a visit to a gallery
- {y:i}A gallery?

1485
02:03:41,755 --> 02:03:45,593
{y:i}Of all the statues that they show
{y:i}I think Venus de Milo

1486
02:03:45,759 --> 02:03:49,013
{y:i}Is the greatest in all Greek mythology

1487
02:03:49,180 --> 02:03:52,683
{y:i}Oh, Mr. Shean
{y:i}Oh, Mr. Shean

1488
02:03:52,850 --> 02:03:56,770
- {y:i}For de Milos' Venus, {y:i}I'm not very keen.
- {y:i}Why not?

1489
02:03:56,937 --> 02:04:00,733
{y:i}For the thing that spoils her charms
{y:i}Are the pair of broken arms

1490
02:04:00,900 --> 02:04:05,029
- {y:i}I didn't see them, Mr. Gallagher
- {y:i}Where were you looking, Mr. Shean?

1491
02:04:09,074 --> 02:04:10,993
- Pop!
- Pretty good, eh?

1492
02:04:11,160 --> 02:04:14,079
Take another bow! Take another bow!
Oh, Jerry!

1493
02:04:18,417 --> 02:04:19,835
Don't leave me holding the bag.

1494
02:04:20,002 --> 02:04:22,213
You did it, Pop!
You knocked them in the aisle.

1495
02:04:22,379 --> 02:04:24,965
I just softened them up for you.
You keep them that way.

1496
02:04:25,132 --> 02:04:27,843
All right. Oh, I gotta get
my costume on.

1497
02:04:28,177 --> 02:04:30,304
- Right?
- Right.

1498
02:04:30,513 --> 02:04:32,723
There's something I wanna ask you
about Susan.

1499
02:04:32,890 --> 02:04:37,102
The answer is yes, Mr. Regan.
But you got to wait five years to hear it.

1500
02:09:47,538 --> 02:09:50,499
Mr. Sage, something's happened outside.

1501
02:09:50,666 --> 02:09:52,168
Excuse me.

1502
02:09:52,710 --> 02:09:55,171
Phone that doctor again
and find out if he's left yet.

1503
02:09:55,337 --> 02:09:56,839
Yes, sir.

1504
02:09:58,924 --> 02:10:00,885
Oh, Sheila.

1505
02:10:10,853 --> 02:10:12,479
Hello...

1506
02:10:13,647 --> 02:10:15,191
...beautiful.

1507
02:10:15,524 --> 02:10:17,860
Hello, Flatbush.

1508
02:10:19,111 --> 02:10:21,947
Did you hear about me and Gil?

1509
02:10:22,114 --> 02:10:24,617
No. Tell me about it.

1510
02:10:25,367 --> 02:10:28,120
We're gonna raise ducks.

1511
02:10:29,788 --> 02:10:31,832
And grandkids.

1512
02:10:34,126 --> 02:10:37,588
Little, yellow, fuzzy ones.
