1
00:00:13,913 --> 00:00:17,144
<i>You're my</i>

2
00:00:17,250 --> 00:00:19,684
<i>Little pinup girl</i>

3
00:00:24,457 --> 00:00:27,392
<i>You're my little pinup girl</i>

4
00:00:31,031 --> 00:00:33,591
<i>You're my little pinup girl</i>

5
00:00:36,936 --> 00:00:38,836
<i>Pinup girl</i>

6
00:01:41,468 --> 00:01:43,902
- Boy, what a ride.
- Never thought we'd make it.

7
00:01:44,003 --> 00:01:45,903
Bye! Oh!

8
00:01:46,005 --> 00:01:49,463
Hey, how many guys are in there anyway?

9
00:01:52,212 --> 00:01:55,147
- Hey, where's the sarge?
- Don't worry. He's in there.

10
00:01:56,282 --> 00:01:58,580
Thanks, lady.
Kinda cozy, wasn't it?

11
00:01:58,685 --> 00:02:00,585
Sure was!

12
00:02:01,855 --> 00:02:04,255
<i>- Give us a lift, lady?
- Okay. Hop in.</i>

13
00:02:15,802 --> 00:02:19,033
You're my little pinup girl

14
00:02:20,073 --> 00:02:22,507
Honestly, you are

15
00:02:23,810 --> 00:02:25,778
How would you like some coffee

16
00:02:25,879 --> 00:02:28,211
A doughnut
An apple

17
00:02:28,314 --> 00:02:30,282
A candy bar

18
00:02:31,918 --> 00:02:35,718
Won't ya be my pinup girl

19
00:02:35,822 --> 00:02:37,790
Give a guy a break

20
00:02:39,526 --> 00:02:41,426
The best that we can give you

21
00:02:41,528 --> 00:02:43,428
- Is cocoa
- A cookie

22
00:02:43,530 --> 00:02:46,158
A piece of angel cake

23
00:02:47,200 --> 00:02:50,363
I have to have that smile

24
00:02:50,470 --> 00:02:52,165
Before me

25
00:02:52,272 --> 00:02:55,867
No matter where I roam

26
00:02:55,975 --> 00:02:59,775
We have some nice
old-fashioned mince pie

27
00:02:59,879 --> 00:03:03,371
Like your mama
used to bake back home

28
00:03:03,483 --> 00:03:07,078
Do I love my pinup girl

29
00:03:07,187 --> 00:03:09,747
With all my heart and soul

30
00:03:10,857 --> 00:03:13,087
I'm sure I understand you

31
00:03:13,193 --> 00:03:15,093
But I'm here to hand you

32
00:03:15,195 --> 00:03:17,459
A hot dog on a roll

33
00:03:19,132 --> 00:03:20,997
We surely understand you

34
00:03:21,100 --> 00:03:23,125
But we're here to hand you

35
00:03:23,236 --> 00:03:25,966
A wienie on a roll

36
00:03:28,441 --> 00:03:31,035
Weenie-meenie-miney-mo

37
00:03:31,144 --> 00:03:33,942
Who's the darlin' of the U.S.O.

38
00:03:34,047 --> 00:03:36,982
Lorry, Lorry
Must be you

39
00:03:37,083 --> 00:03:39,916
Tell us a story
Lorry, do

40
00:03:41,187 --> 00:03:46,716
Okay, I'll tell you one that's true

41
00:03:47,827 --> 00:03:51,024
A boy sent his baby a note

42
00:03:51,130 --> 00:03:55,032
And this is exactly
what he wrote, quote

43
00:03:55,134 --> 00:03:58,433
Honey, don't worry your head about

44
00:03:58,538 --> 00:04:02,338
Those pinup girls you've read about

45
00:04:02,442 --> 00:04:06,742
For you most certainly know

46
00:04:06,846 --> 00:04:12,045
You're my little pinup girl

47
00:04:12,151 --> 00:04:16,178
Honestly, you are

48
00:04:16,289 --> 00:04:19,417
To me you have the grace of an angel

49
00:04:19,525 --> 00:04:23,791
The face of a movie star

50
00:04:24,931 --> 00:04:27,900
You're my little pinup girl

51
00:04:30,003 --> 00:04:33,131
Though we are apart

52
00:04:33,239 --> 00:04:35,434
When I'm in sleepy willow

53
00:04:35,541 --> 00:04:37,668
You're pinned on my pillow

54
00:04:37,777 --> 00:04:41,508
And also in my heart

55
00:04:41,614 --> 00:04:45,106
I have to have that smile

56
00:04:45,218 --> 00:04:47,209
Before me

57
00:04:47,320 --> 00:04:50,983
No matter where I roam

58
00:04:51,090 --> 00:04:55,584
That twinkle in your eyes
can warm me

59
00:04:55,695 --> 00:04:58,687
Like a fireside at home

60
00:04:58,798 --> 00:05:03,531
Do I love my pinup girl

61
00:05:03,636 --> 00:05:07,470
Bet your life I do

62
00:05:07,573 --> 00:05:09,837
So, baby, keep a-grinning

63
00:05:09,942 --> 00:05:11,967
Remember, I'm pinning

64
00:05:12,078 --> 00:05:15,309
My hopes on you

65
00:05:15,415 --> 00:05:19,715
I have to have that smile

66
00:05:19,819 --> 00:05:21,912
Before me

67
00:05:22,021 --> 00:05:26,754
No matter where I roam

68
00:05:26,859 --> 00:05:30,818
The twinkle in your eyes

69
00:05:30,930 --> 00:05:33,558
Can warm me

70
00:05:33,666 --> 00:05:36,658
Like a fireside

71
00:05:36,769 --> 00:05:38,669
At home

72
00:05:38,771 --> 00:05:44,539
Do you love your pinup girl

73
00:05:44,644 --> 00:05:47,613
Bet your life we do
Do-doo-doo-doo

74
00:05:47,714 --> 00:05:53,311
Well, baby, keep a-grinnin'

75
00:05:53,419 --> 00:05:56,684
Remember

76
00:05:56,789 --> 00:06:01,920
I'm pinning all my hopes

77
00:06:02,028 --> 00:06:04,656
On you

78
00:07:46,332 --> 00:07:48,232
- Miss Jones?
- Yes?

79
00:07:48,334 --> 00:07:51,735
I'm a deputation from Company "B."
I got a protest to read to you.

80
00:07:51,838 --> 00:07:56,207
"A proclamation from the men of Company 'B'
in protest to LorryJones.

81
00:07:56,309 --> 00:08:01,144
"Whereas the men of Company 'B'-
of which I am one-

82
00:08:01,247 --> 00:08:03,943
"have enjoyed
the Missoula U.S.O. canteen...

83
00:08:04,050 --> 00:08:09,647
"and whereas such enjoyment was caused by
the charming presence of Miss LorryJones...

84
00:08:09,755 --> 00:08:15,193
"therefore, be it resolved that Company 'B'
herewith lodges formal protest...

85
00:08:15,294 --> 00:08:19,321
"and begs Miss Jones to call off
her trip to Washington, D. C...

86
00:08:19,432 --> 00:08:22,629
and stick right here in town
where we need her, whereas!"

87
00:08:24,737 --> 00:08:26,637
I think that's awfully sweet of you...

88
00:08:26,739 --> 00:08:29,640
but I've already given my promise
to the U.S.O. in Washington...

89
00:08:29,742 --> 00:08:31,642
that I'd go with
one of their road shows.

90
00:08:31,744 --> 00:08:34,178
- Oh, no, Lorry!
- They're sending me to all their camps.

91
00:08:34,280 --> 00:08:37,181
- I think they're gonna make me an honorary colonel.
- Really?

92
00:08:37,283 --> 00:08:39,183
LorryJones,
how can you stand there-

93
00:08:39,285 --> 00:08:42,186
They were even gonna send a military escort
to take me to the train tonight...

94
00:08:42,288 --> 00:08:44,188
but I thought that was too much.

95
00:08:44,290 --> 00:08:47,191
<i>- That is too much- way too much.
- What's with her?</i>

96
00:08:47,293 --> 00:08:50,558
Well, if you gotta go, you gotta go.

97
00:08:50,663 --> 00:08:53,564
But what about those pinup pictures
you promised us?

98
00:08:53,666 --> 00:08:55,896
I have them all ready for you.

99
00:08:56,002 --> 00:08:58,800
Come on over to the counter.

100
00:09:00,773 --> 00:09:03,674
Say, do you know
where I can find LorryJones?

101
00:09:03,776 --> 00:09:06,244
Yeah, but I ain't gonna tell you.

102
00:09:07,847 --> 00:09:10,475
- Come on, Lorry. I was the first one here.
- Me too, Lorry!

103
00:09:10,583 --> 00:09:12,983
How 'bout me, Lorry?
You promised me one!

104
00:09:13,085 --> 00:09:15,485
It says the same on each of them-
"With Love, Lorry."

105
00:09:15,588 --> 00:09:17,988
- Lorry!
- Hello. Here's the last one. That's all, fellas.

106
00:09:18,090 --> 00:09:19,990
Come on, Lorry. We'd better hurry!

107
00:09:20,092 --> 00:09:22,993
I'll have to say good-bye, unless a few of you
want to see Kay and me to the station.

108
00:09:23,095 --> 00:09:27,964
- What do you mean, a few of us?
We'll all go! Huh, fellas?

109
00:09:28,067 --> 00:09:32,060
But, Lorry, don't you remember?
I'm the guy you became engaged to last night.

110
00:09:33,172 --> 00:09:35,003
George! Of course!

111
00:09:35,107 --> 00:09:37,575
I'm supposed to take you
to the station alone!

112
00:09:37,677 --> 00:09:40,407
- What do you mean, "alone"? Get a load of this guy!
- Where do you get that?

113
00:09:40,513 --> 00:09:42,640
We're all going with you!

114
00:09:42,748 --> 00:09:45,216
Wait a minute.
I know how I can settle it, fellas.

115
00:09:45,318 --> 00:09:47,786
George will go with me, and you'll go with Kay,
but we'll be together.

116
00:09:47,887 --> 00:09:49,855
- How's that?
- Swell!

117
00:09:51,991 --> 00:09:55,620
- Stop pushin', will you?
- We at Company "B" are gonna miss ya.

118
00:09:55,728 --> 00:09:58,697
This U.S.O. canteen
will never be the same.

119
00:10:14,213 --> 00:10:17,580
<i>I don't feel like taking my clothes off
with just that little curtain...</i>

120
00:10:17,683 --> 00:10:19,651
<i>between us and the world.</i>

121
00:10:19,752 --> 00:10:21,720
<i>Don't be silly, Kay.
What are you afraid of?</i>

122
00:10:21,821 --> 00:10:25,188
Why are you so brave?
You've never been in a Pullman before.

123
00:10:25,291 --> 00:10:29,284
Oh, yes, I have, when I visited
my uncle in California.

124
00:10:29,395 --> 00:10:32,091
You've never been out of Missouri
in your life.

125
00:10:32,198 --> 00:10:35,167
Lorry, sometime someone's
gonna catch up with you good.

126
00:10:35,267 --> 00:10:38,532
You'll never get away with making people back
home believe you've gone to Washington...

127
00:10:38,638 --> 00:10:40,606
to join a U.S.O. show.

128
00:10:40,706 --> 00:10:43,231
Oh, I don't know why you just didn't
tell them the honest truth.

129
00:10:43,342 --> 00:10:46,436
And let them know we're only gonna work
as stenographers for civil service?

130
00:10:46,545 --> 00:10:49,343
- Why should I?
- Because it's the truth.

131
00:10:49,448 --> 00:10:52,781
Maybe it is right now, but something
could change it, couldn't it?

132
00:10:52,885 --> 00:10:55,513
When you let people believe things
that aren't so, it's lying.

133
00:10:55,621 --> 00:10:58,647
Like letting that marine who brought us
to the train think he's engaged to you.

134
00:10:58,758 --> 00:11:01,056
You have about six other boys
thinking the same thing.

135
00:11:01,160 --> 00:11:04,823
They wanna think it. Besides,
I like being nice to the boys in service.

136
00:11:04,930 --> 00:11:08,525
Anyway, I'll probably never
even see them again.

137
00:11:08,634 --> 00:11:10,602
You better not see them again...

138
00:11:10,703 --> 00:11:13,069
at least not all at the same time.

139
00:11:13,172 --> 00:11:16,164
Oh, Lorry, why do you
always have to tell fibs?

140
00:11:16,275 --> 00:11:18,903
<i>- I don't tell fibs.
- Quiet.!</i>

141
00:11:19,011 --> 00:11:20,911
I just make things up.

142
00:11:21,013 --> 00:11:24,141
It's certainly no thrill pushing a typewriter
and eating drugstore lunches...

143
00:11:24,250 --> 00:11:26,218
and being a fixture in an office.

144
00:11:26,318 --> 00:11:30,448
Just the same, I'm thrilled
with being just what we are.

145
00:11:30,556 --> 00:11:34,390
Imagine us in Washington
Sunday morning.

146
00:11:34,493 --> 00:11:37,792
Imagine us in New York
Sunday morning.

147
00:11:37,897 --> 00:11:39,865
Gee, won't it be-

148
00:11:42,134 --> 00:11:44,762
Laura Jones!

149
00:11:44,870 --> 00:11:47,338
I knew I shouldn't
have come with you!

150
00:11:47,440 --> 00:11:49,908
- If you start planning anything funny-
- Why not?

151
00:11:50,009 --> 00:11:53,308
- We don't have to report for work until Monday.
- But, Lorry!

152
00:11:53,412 --> 00:11:55,642
Oh, I won't listen to you.

153
00:11:55,748 --> 00:11:59,479
And besides, we promised my aunt
in Baltimore that we'd visit her Sunday...

154
00:11:59,585 --> 00:12:01,553
and, well, if we don't show up-

155
00:12:01,654 --> 00:12:04,623
- We can tell her our train was wrecked.
- There you go again.

156
00:12:04,724 --> 00:12:06,624
<i>Quiet.!</i>

157
00:12:28,013 --> 00:12:30,208
Pardon me.
What's all the excitement about?

158
00:12:30,316 --> 00:12:33,114
Tommy Dooley, one of the navy heroes
from Guadalcanal, is arriving.

159
00:12:33,219 --> 00:12:36,017
Kay, our first thrill, and we're
only off the train two minutes!

160
00:12:36,122 --> 00:12:38,590
<i>Here he comes now.!</i>

161
00:12:55,975 --> 00:12:58,443
- Hi, Tommy. Nice going, sailor.
- Hiya, big boy!

162
00:12:58,544 --> 00:13:01,536
- Welcome to New York.
- Thanks-

163
00:13:01,647 --> 00:13:03,615
Uh, I'm afraid I don't remember-

164
00:13:03,716 --> 00:13:06,241
You don't?

165
00:13:06,352 --> 00:13:08,820
- Mabel?
- Nope. Try again.

166
00:13:08,921 --> 00:13:10,821
- Fifi.
- Nope.

167
00:13:10,923 --> 00:13:12,891
Here.
Maybe I got a better memory.

168
00:13:12,992 --> 00:13:16,894
Stand back, and let her keep trying.
I think I'm getting warmer.

169
00:13:19,398 --> 00:13:21,366
Who's that girl, his fiancée?

170
00:13:21,467 --> 00:13:24,595
No, ma'am. That's Miss Molly McKay,
a nightclub entertainer.

171
00:13:24,703 --> 00:13:27,001
She sure love heroes,
and she meets them all.

172
00:13:27,106 --> 00:13:29,666
If they're all like him,
it must be a wonderful hobby.

173
00:13:29,775 --> 00:13:32,972
Ah, just call me Molly, and don't you
dare let me see you lookin' lonesome.

174
00:13:33,078 --> 00:13:35,546
Well, grab a wing, sailor.
We're goin' places.

175
00:13:35,648 --> 00:13:38,116
- Just a minute, lady. Don't you think-
- She is thinkin'.

176
00:13:38,217 --> 00:13:41,015
Whatever it is, I'm for it.
Come on. Let's go.

177
00:13:41,120 --> 00:13:44,988
That's our first thrill.
Let's go look for another one.

178
00:14:19,558 --> 00:14:24,291
<i>Will this dream come true</i>

179
00:14:24,396 --> 00:14:30,858
Or bring a blue tomorrow

180
00:14:37,610 --> 00:14:43,173
Time alone will tell

181
00:14:43,282 --> 00:14:47,048
If our romance is real

182
00:14:47,152 --> 00:14:52,613
Or just a springtime spell

183
00:14:52,725 --> 00:14:55,819
For heaven knows

184
00:14:55,928 --> 00:14:59,230
And time will tell

185
00:15:01,333 --> 00:15:03,801
<i>- Bonsoir, mademoiselle.
- We'd like a table, please.</i>

186
00:15:03,903 --> 00:15:05,837
Uh, any little table will do.

187
00:15:05,938 --> 00:15:08,873
In what name did mademoiselle call
to make the reservation?

188
00:15:08,974 --> 00:15:10,874
Oh, well, we didn't think-

189
00:15:10,976 --> 00:15:12,876
Yes, I'm sorry, mademoiselle.

190
00:15:12,978 --> 00:15:15,947
- For this evening, all tables are taken.
- Pierre, no tables?

191
00:15:16,048 --> 00:15:19,017
<i>Bonsoir, madame.
You have reservations, of course.</i>

192
00:15:19,118 --> 00:15:21,018
<i>This way, please.</i>

193
00:15:22,554 --> 00:15:25,022
He gave them a table,
and they didn't have an escort.

194
00:15:25,124 --> 00:15:27,592
When he saw us coming,
he put the rope up.

195
00:15:27,693 --> 00:15:31,129
We should have used our imagination.
We should have-

196
00:15:31,230 --> 00:15:33,357
Lorry, don't. Don't use yours.

197
00:15:33,465 --> 00:15:36,298
You do such awful things with it.

198
00:15:36,402 --> 00:15:38,370
Excuse me, please.

199
00:15:38,470 --> 00:15:40,438
When the gentleman
we were expecting arrives...

200
00:15:40,539 --> 00:15:43,167
tell him the ladies left
because you didn't have a table.

201
00:15:43,275 --> 00:15:45,334
<i>Oui, mademoiselle.
The gentleman's name?</i>

202
00:15:45,444 --> 00:15:47,207
Mr. Tommy Dooley from Guadalcanal.

203
00:15:47,313 --> 00:15:49,838
<i>Certainement, mademoiselle.
Mr. Tommy-Tommy Dooley?</i>

204
00:15:49,949 --> 00:15:51,917
Oh, mademoiselle, there is a mistake!

205
00:15:52,017 --> 00:15:55,885
Of course we have a table for Mr. Dooley.
The best, at the ringside.

206
00:15:55,988 --> 00:15:58,388
<i>Please! This way, s'il vous plait.</i>

207
00:15:58,490 --> 00:16:03,291
<i>Sing if you are in my arms</i>

208
00:16:03,395 --> 00:16:07,889
<i>We'll know it's not a spell</i>

209
00:16:08,000 --> 00:16:11,663
We'll know it's real

210
00:16:11,770 --> 00:16:15,035
But time will tell

211
00:16:15,140 --> 00:16:18,439
How could you look him in the eye and tell him
we were expecting Tommy Dooley?

212
00:16:18,544 --> 00:16:22,241
Well, he's important. The headwaiter knows him.
And it worked. We're in.

213
00:17:06,492 --> 00:17:09,427
Ooh

214
00:17:10,462 --> 00:17:13,397
Time alone

215
00:17:13,499 --> 00:17:24,967
Will tell

216
00:17:36,121 --> 00:17:38,146
Good evening. I'm Eddie Hall.

217
00:17:38,257 --> 00:17:41,158
I hope you liked that number.
Boys played it just for you.

218
00:17:41,260 --> 00:17:44,161
- Gardenias, as big as sunflowers!
- Mm-hmm.

219
00:17:44,263 --> 00:17:47,232
- Uh, d-did you say your name was-
- Eddie Hall.

220
00:17:47,332 --> 00:17:49,266
I'm the owner of the show.

221
00:17:49,368 --> 00:17:52,667
Just a little gift. We present them
to all our important guests.

222
00:17:52,771 --> 00:17:56,969
- Oh, but, Mr. Hall- - That's very nice
of you, and the music was wonderful.

223
00:17:57,076 --> 00:17:59,840
It reminded me so much
of the night I was in Paris.

224
00:17:59,945 --> 00:18:02,505
- Prince Dubonnet had just
asked me to dance- Oh!

225
00:18:04,349 --> 00:18:07,079
- Lorry, don't you think- I mean-
- Pardon me.

226
00:18:07,186 --> 00:18:09,484
Molly and Mr. Dooley just arrived.

227
00:18:12,458 --> 00:18:14,426
Excuse me.

228
00:18:14,526 --> 00:18:17,495
- Lorry-
- Oh! Thank you.

229
00:18:17,596 --> 00:18:20,724
Let's get out of here before
we get into any more trouble.

230
00:18:20,833 --> 00:18:24,599
Don't be silly. He has no way of finding out
whether we know Dooley or not.

231
00:18:24,703 --> 00:18:27,501
Oh, what that'll do to you
with your ideas.

232
00:18:27,606 --> 00:18:29,506
Try it. Go ahead.

233
00:18:36,715 --> 00:18:38,683
Tommy, you old son of a gun!

234
00:18:38,784 --> 00:18:41,378
- Eddie, shake hands with a pal o' mine, Dud Miller.
- Pleased to meet you.

235
00:18:41,487 --> 00:18:44,047
- You're an optimist.
- Molly, we're late with the show.

236
00:18:44,156 --> 00:18:46,920
Will you get out from under that soup plate
and get into your costume?

237
00:18:47,025 --> 00:18:50,984
After my number, I'll be back. Don't let Eddie
bore you. Remember, I saw you first.

238
00:18:51,096 --> 00:18:53,064
Always kidding. Oh, Pierre.

239
00:18:53,165 --> 00:18:55,725
I'll have you seated,
and we'll go on with the show.

240
00:18:55,834 --> 00:18:58,302
<i>- Take Mr. Dooley and his friend to their table.
- Oui, monsieur.</i>

241
00:18:58,403 --> 00:19:00,963
Thanks a million, Eddie, and hurry back.
We want you with us.

242
00:19:01,073 --> 00:19:04,042
Maybe you'll change your mind when you
see what's waiting for you at the table.

243
00:19:04,143 --> 00:19:06,441
What's he mean by that?

244
00:19:06,545 --> 00:19:09,537
A big dinner, of course.
A swell guy like that thinks of everything.

245
00:19:09,648 --> 00:19:11,843
This way, monsieur.

246
00:19:25,697 --> 00:19:28,427
<i>- It's Tommy Dooley.!
- Attaboy, Dooley.!</i>

247
00:19:28,534 --> 00:19:30,729
<i>Dooley.! Dooley.!</i>

248
00:19:30,836 --> 00:19:33,361
Oh, come on!
Let's get out of here!

249
00:19:33,472 --> 00:19:36,066
<i>Mr. Dooley, your guests.</i>

250
00:19:36,175 --> 00:19:39,144
There. Didn't I tell you a guy
like that thinks of everything?

251
00:19:39,244 --> 00:19:41,678
- Thanks. How do you do?
- How do you do?

252
00:19:41,780 --> 00:19:45,876
- Gee, I didn't expect a surprise like this.
- You and us both.

253
00:19:45,984 --> 00:19:48,680
It was nice of Eddie to invite you.
I'm glad you're here.

254
00:19:48,787 --> 00:19:52,018
Oh, thank you, but, well, you see-

255
00:19:52,124 --> 00:19:55,651
I'll bet you two girls are actresses, huh?

256
00:19:55,761 --> 00:19:59,390
- Oh, heavens, no. We're just-
- We're in musical comedy.

257
00:19:59,498 --> 00:20:02,296
<i>- Really? What show are you with?
- Uh, Remember Me.</i>

258
00:20:02,401 --> 00:20:04,926
No, I can't say that I do,
but I just got back in town-

259
00:20:05,037 --> 00:20:07,904
- That's the name of their show here on Broadway.
- We'll have to see it.

260
00:20:08,006 --> 00:20:10,566
Splendid!
We'll get you some tickets.

261
00:20:10,676 --> 00:20:14,237
- I think we'd better be going.
- What's the idea? What did we do?

262
00:20:14,346 --> 00:20:18,646
And besides, we just met.
You don't want to break my heart, do you?

263
00:20:18,750 --> 00:20:21,480
I don't suppose there need be
any rush about it.

264
00:20:21,587 --> 00:20:24,954
Good. At least we've got one thing settled
for the rest of the evening.

265
00:20:36,001 --> 00:20:38,970
When the red red robins
and the bob bobwhites

266
00:20:39,071 --> 00:20:41,665
And pretty bluebirds
sing you out of bed

267
00:20:41,773 --> 00:20:43,673
They're tweet-tweetin' to tell you

268
00:20:43,775 --> 00:20:45,675
In their tweet way

269
00:20:45,777 --> 00:20:48,177
That there's a happier day ahead

270
00:20:48,280 --> 00:20:51,249
When the red red robins
and the bob bobwhites

271
00:20:51,350 --> 00:20:54,148
And pretty bluebirds
chirp their little tune

272
00:20:54,253 --> 00:20:57,279
They're just tryin' to sell you
a bill of goods

273
00:20:57,389 --> 00:21:00,324
But we'll be out of the woods
real soon

274
00:21:00,425 --> 00:21:03,883
When they're whistlin'
on your windowsill

275
00:21:06,398 --> 00:21:09,367
Join along in their familiar song

276
00:21:09,468 --> 00:21:12,437
If you won't
the whippoorwill will

277
00:21:12,537 --> 00:21:15,870
Oh, it's not so easy
to be gay and breezy

278
00:21:15,974 --> 00:21:18,499
When the whole darn world
is in a stew

279
00:21:18,610 --> 00:21:21,738
But to help the morale
won't you be a good pal

280
00:21:21,847 --> 00:21:24,577
Won't you warble a chorus or two

281
00:21:24,683 --> 00:21:27,777
Like the red red robins
and the bob bobwhites

282
00:21:27,886 --> 00:21:29,945
And the bluebirds do

283
00:21:35,527 --> 00:21:38,496
Hep, hep, you cats dig me righteously

284
00:21:38,597 --> 00:21:41,498
Speakin' of birds
it's occurred to me

285
00:21:41,600 --> 00:21:44,728
I know a new bird
who's no bluebird

286
00:21:44,836 --> 00:21:47,634
He can rock it
Wait and see

287
00:21:50,742 --> 00:21:53,575
You've just heard the "jitterbird"

288
00:21:53,679 --> 00:21:56,147
<i>Jivin'in a jumpin'key</i>

289
00:21:56,248 --> 00:22:02,187
Oh, it's not so easy

290
00:22:02,287 --> 00:22:05,222
To be gay, gay

291
00:22:05,324 --> 00:22:07,224
And breezy

292
00:22:07,326 --> 00:22:10,921
When the whole darn world

293
00:22:11,029 --> 00:22:16,160
Is in a stew

294
00:22:16,268 --> 00:22:19,635
But to help the morale
won't you be a good pal

295
00:22:19,738 --> 00:22:22,502
Won't you warble a chorus or two

296
00:22:22,607 --> 00:22:26,270
Like the red red robins
and the bob bobwhites

297
00:22:26,378 --> 00:22:30,337
And the bluebirds do

298
00:22:33,785 --> 00:22:37,084
<i>When the red red robins</i>

299
00:22:38,190 --> 00:22:40,488

<i>Join along in their familiar song</i>

307
00:23:04,583 --> 00:23:07,518
<i>If you won't
the whippoorwill will</i>

308
00:23:08,820 --> 00:23:11,948
<i>It's not so easy
to be gay and breezy</i>

309
00:23:12,057 --> 00:23:15,390
<i>When the whole darn world
is in a stew</i>

310
00:23:15,494 --> 00:23:19,453
<i>But to help the morale
won't you be a good pal</i>

311
00:23:19,564 --> 00:23:26,163
<i>And do as they do</i>

312
00:25:15,547 --> 00:25:18,448
<i>Ah, ah, ah, ah</i>

313
00:25:18,550 --> 00:25:21,883
<i>Ah, ah, ah, ah</i>

314
00:25:21,987 --> 00:25:25,184
<i>Ah, ah, ah, ah</i>

315
00:25:25,290 --> 00:25:28,817
<i>Ah, ah, ah</i>

316
00:25:36,835 --> 00:25:41,602
<i>But to help the morale
won't you be a good pal</i>

317
00:25:41,706 --> 00:25:44,402
<i>And sing</i>

318
00:25:44,509 --> 00:25:46,670
<i>Sing</i>

319
00:25:46,778 --> 00:25:49,975
<i>Sing like the robins</i>

320
00:25:50,081 --> 00:25:55,781
<i>And the bluebirds do</i>

321
00:25:55,887 --> 00:25:59,323
<i>Ah, ah</i>

322
00:25:59,424 --> 00:26:05,329
<i>Ah, ah, ah, ah</i>

323
00:27:12,564 --> 00:27:17,627
<i>Oh, don't be uneasy
Just be gay and breezy</i>

324
00:27:17,736 --> 00:27:21,263
<i>When the whole darn world
is in a stew</i>

325
00:27:21,373 --> 00:27:25,241
<i>Like the red red robins
and the bob bobwhites</i>

326
00:27:25,343 --> 00:27:29,473
<i>And the bluebirds</i>

327
00:27:29,581 --> 00:27:37,317
<i>Do</i>

328
00:27:40,759 --> 00:27:43,853
- Wasn't it beautiful?
- Yes, and Miss McKay can certainly put over a song.

329
00:27:43,962 --> 00:27:47,591
- And how!
- She's a swell gal too. She and Eddie will be over to join us.

330
00:27:49,668 --> 00:27:51,568
They will?

331
00:27:51,670 --> 00:27:55,299
Oh, I think that will be wonderful.

332
00:27:55,407 --> 00:27:59,503
- I mean, I wonder if I can make a phone call.
- That's right. Uncle Herman.

333
00:27:59,611 --> 00:28:02,409
He'll never forgive us
for not phoning him.

334
00:28:02,514 --> 00:28:05,108
<i>Hey, wait a minute.
What's the rush?</i>

335
00:28:05,216 --> 00:28:07,878
- Oh, well, we were just going to make a phone call.
- Don't go.

336
00:28:07,986 --> 00:28:12,286
I'll have a phone brought to the table.
Sit down.

337
00:28:12,390 --> 00:28:15,484
I've been talking to your friends,
but I don't think Molly has met them.

338
00:28:15,593 --> 00:28:17,754
<i>- Introduce us.
- Introduce you?</i>

339
00:28:17,862 --> 00:28:19,830
<i>- Yeah.
- Aren't they friends of yours?</i>

340
00:28:19,931 --> 00:28:22,399
I guess we're all a little mixed up.
You see-

341
00:28:22,500 --> 00:28:26,960
- You mean to say you didn't invite these girls here?
- Me? I invited them?

342
00:28:27,072 --> 00:28:29,540
Oh, now I think I'm beginning
to get the angle.

343
00:28:29,641 --> 00:28:32,439
- You figured I'd get lost in the traffic, huh?
- Wait a minute, Molly.

344
00:28:32,544 --> 00:28:35,206
You know that I wouldn't do
anything like that to you for the world.

345
00:28:35,313 --> 00:28:37,508
Tell her the truth. Did I invite you-

346
00:28:37,615 --> 00:28:40,584
When the agent phoned and told us to come over,
well, naturally we thought that-

347
00:28:40,685 --> 00:28:43,153
Agent? What agent phoned you?

348
00:28:43,254 --> 00:28:46,690
How should I know? All he said
was to see you about the tryout-

349
00:28:46,791 --> 00:28:50,090
<i>Don't you realize that this is Miss Lorraine
from the musical comedy Remember Me?</i>

350
00:28:50,195 --> 00:28:52,663
You see, we came right over
from the theater...

351
00:28:52,764 --> 00:28:55,255
and I guess, by mistake,
they seated us at this table.

352
00:28:55,366 --> 00:28:57,459
<i>Just a minute.
Remember Me closed last night.</i>

353
00:28:57,569 --> 00:29:00,834
What's the difference?
They're here now, and everybody's happy.

354
00:29:00,939 --> 00:29:04,670
<i>- Aren't we?
- If you were in Remember Me, you know all the numbers.</i>

355
00:29:04,776 --> 00:29:08,644
Oh, heavens to Betsy, yes.
She knows them backwards. Why, back in-

356
00:29:08,747 --> 00:29:11,716
Well, that's fine. Why don't we
have her try one out right now?

357
00:29:11,816 --> 00:29:13,784
I told you,
I don't know anything about it!

358
00:29:13,885 --> 00:29:17,651
I think it's a swell idea, and we're all for it.
Aren't we, Miss Lorraine?

359
00:29:17,756 --> 00:29:20,850
Oh, I'd love to, but we have
to catch a train in 40 minutes.

360
00:29:20,959 --> 00:29:23,325
We're joining the U.S.O. show
in Washington.

361
00:29:23,428 --> 00:29:27,057
- This'll only take a couple of minutes.
- I'm sorry. I can't.

362
00:29:27,165 --> 00:29:29,133
- I have a cold.
- Oh, come on.

363
00:29:29,234 --> 00:29:32,635
There's no need for me to deliberately
flaunt myself with laryngitis, is there?

364
00:29:34,205 --> 00:29:38,335
- Come on.
- Well, it's too late to phone Uncle Herman now.

365
00:29:44,983 --> 00:29:48,111
Ladies and gentlemen,
I have a big surprise for you.

366
00:29:48,219 --> 00:29:51,518
As a matter of fact, it's a bigger
surprise to me than it'll be to you.

367
00:29:51,623 --> 00:29:54,649
<i>You all remember me?
I mean, the show Remember Me.</i>

368
00:29:54,759 --> 00:29:56,556
Then surely you'll remember her.

369
00:29:56,761 --> 00:29:59,286
Ladies and gentlemen,
I give you Miss Laura Lorraine...

370
00:29:59,397 --> 00:30:01,957
in "Don't Carry Tales."

371
00:30:02,066 --> 00:30:05,900
All right? Take it away, Charlie.

372
00:30:11,643 --> 00:30:14,976
Listen, children
Listen to your teacher

373
00:30:15,079 --> 00:30:18,105
Pay attention and learn your ABC's

374
00:30:18,216 --> 00:30:22,243
And when you grow up
you can be a quiz kid

375
00:30:22,353 --> 00:30:24,617
Or a guest of honor

376
00:30:24,722 --> 00:30:27,987
<i>On Information Please</i>

377
00:30:28,092 --> 00:30:31,220
Listen, children
Listen to your teacher

378
00:30:31,329 --> 00:30:35,026
You gotta know your figures
if you wanna be considered bright

379
00:30:35,133 --> 00:30:38,762
Tell us more, oh, teacher

380
00:30:38,870 --> 00:30:41,703
Tell us more, more, more

381
00:30:43,041 --> 00:30:45,976
Listen, children
Listen to your teacher

382
00:30:46,077 --> 00:30:50,446
Battles are won in the daytime

383
00:30:50,548 --> 00:30:53,540
Ah, but history is made at night

384
00:30:53,651 --> 00:30:57,747
Tell us more, oh, teacher
Tell us more

385
00:30:57,856 --> 00:30:59,619
- More?
- More!

386
00:30:59,724 --> 00:31:03,922
If you want to be teacher's pet

387
00:31:04,028 --> 00:31:06,656
Here's a little motto
that you mustn't

388
00:31:06,764 --> 00:31:10,029
No, you dasn't ever forget

389
00:31:10,134 --> 00:31:13,535
Don't carry tales out of school

390
00:31:13,638 --> 00:31:17,165
'Cause if you do
you're a fool

391
00:31:17,275 --> 00:31:19,903
You mustn't tell
everything you know

392
00:31:20,011 --> 00:31:23,344
And keep it to yourself
that I love you so much

393
00:31:23,448 --> 00:31:25,678
Don't carry tales out of school

394
00:31:25,783 --> 00:31:29,981
You'll find it's a pip of a rule

395
00:31:30,088 --> 00:31:32,818
And though a busybody
may insist

396
00:31:32,924 --> 00:31:36,451
Don't let on that we've kissed

397
00:31:36,561 --> 00:31:39,223
If you're a blabbermouth
you're off my list

398
00:31:39,330 --> 00:31:42,299
So don't be a stubborn mule, baby

399
00:31:42,400 --> 00:31:44,925
And don't carry tales out of school

400
00:31:45,036 --> 00:31:48,631
Tell us more, oh, teacher
Tell us more

401
00:31:48,740 --> 00:31:52,699
Well, don't you think
we ought to dance now

402
00:31:55,079 --> 00:31:57,604
You'd better button up
your upper lip

403
00:32:01,586 --> 00:32:03,986
A little slip may sink your ship

404
00:32:11,329 --> 00:32:13,797
If you're a blabbermouth
you're off my list

405
00:32:13,898 --> 00:32:17,265
So don't be a stubborn mule, baby

406
00:32:17,368 --> 00:32:19,131
- Hush.
- Shush.

407
00:32:19,237 --> 00:32:21,137
- Psst.
- Hey.

408
00:32:23,841 --> 00:32:26,969
If as a lover
you're a riot

409
00:32:27,078 --> 00:32:30,514
Don't let out a peep
Just keep it quiet

410
00:32:30,615 --> 00:32:35,416
Don't carry tales out of school

411
00:32:36,921 --> 00:32:39,719
Yes, sir!

412
00:32:39,824 --> 00:32:43,055
<i>Whoo-hoo-hoo-hoo.!</i>

413
00:32:43,161 --> 00:32:45,823
Whoo-hoo!

414
00:32:49,600 --> 00:32:52,034
Terrific guy-
that Malcolm on the drums.

415
00:32:54,605 --> 00:32:56,937
- You were swell.
- Oh, thank you.

416
00:32:57,041 --> 00:32:59,373
- May I have this dance?
- Uh-huh.

417
00:33:01,713 --> 00:33:03,943
Hold it. Thank you.

418
00:33:06,985 --> 00:33:10,443
I think it's swell that a big
musical-comedy star like you...

419
00:33:10,555 --> 00:33:14,013
could come here on a blind date,
not knowing who you were going to meet.

420
00:33:14,125 --> 00:33:16,889
Oh, one gets tired of the usual bankers...

421
00:33:16,995 --> 00:33:19,691
and millionaires and playboys.

422
00:33:19,797 --> 00:33:23,255
It's rather nice meeting
someone... different.

423
00:33:27,572 --> 00:33:29,540
<i>Where do I come off?</i>

424
00:33:29,640 --> 00:33:32,609
<i>Does he have to dance
every dance with her?</i>

425
00:33:34,579 --> 00:33:38,276
<i>Train number 61:</i>

426
00:33:38,383 --> 00:33:41,511
<i>Newark, New Brunswick,
Elizabethtown.</i>

427
00:33:41,619 --> 00:33:43,917
- Yes, ma'am.
- Did you think we were never coming back?

428
00:33:44,022 --> 00:33:46,422
Nothing like a hamper of goodies
to take on the train.

429
00:33:46,524 --> 00:33:49,721
- You look like Santy Claus.
- As far as I'm concerned, it is Christmas.

430
00:33:51,763 --> 00:33:54,630
You don't know what the past few hours
have meant to me, Lorry.

431
00:33:54,732 --> 00:33:58,259
- They were wonderful.
- I had a terrible disappointment when I came home.

432
00:33:58,369 --> 00:34:00,269
You did? How?

433
00:34:00,371 --> 00:34:02,839
Well, sounds kind of goofy, but...

434
00:34:02,940 --> 00:34:06,933
while I was in Guadalcanal, a girl sent me
a fan letter with her picture in it.

435
00:34:07,045 --> 00:34:09,343
Boy, did I fall-
hook, line and sinker.

436
00:34:09,447 --> 00:34:11,915
I could hardly wait
till I got home to meet her.

437
00:34:12,016 --> 00:34:13,984
And now you find she doesn't like you?

438
00:34:14,085 --> 00:34:16,053
It was a bigger disappointment than that.

439
00:34:16,154 --> 00:34:19,715
I found she was married and the picture
she'd sent had been taken 15 years ago.

440
00:34:19,824 --> 00:34:21,724
Oh.

441
00:34:26,230 --> 00:34:30,894
Now you know what it means to meet a girl
like you who's really on the level.

442
00:34:32,303 --> 00:34:34,737
<i>The 12:30 for Trenton-</i>

443
00:34:34,839 --> 00:34:36,807
<i>- Lorry, come on. We'll miss our train.
- Baltimore-</i>

444
00:34:36,908 --> 00:34:39,376
Ooh, that's us. I guess
we'll have to say good-bye now.

445
00:34:39,477 --> 00:34:41,911
Wait a minute. We haven't got your address.
Who's got a pencil?

446
00:34:42,013 --> 00:34:44,106
- I have.
- Get me paper, somebody, quick.

447
00:34:44,215 --> 00:34:46,410
Here. Write it on the back
of that magazine.

448
00:34:46,517 --> 00:34:49,077
We're stopping off to visit
Kay's aunt in Baltimore first...

449
00:34:49,187 --> 00:34:52,486
so if you want to write, you'd better
send the letters in care of her.

450
00:34:52,590 --> 00:34:55,718
- What's her address?
- 473 Oriole Street.

451
00:34:55,827 --> 00:34:58,796
And my aunt's name
is Miss Minny Pritchett.

452
00:34:58,896 --> 00:35:01,865
Gee, it'll be like doing time
in the brig till we hear from you.

453
00:35:01,966 --> 00:35:04,764
I don't know what you mean,
but sounds awful nice.

454
00:35:06,204 --> 00:35:09,833
Hold out your arms-
for the packages, I mean.

455
00:35:09,941 --> 00:35:11,909
- Can you hold 'em all?
- Uh-huh.

456
00:35:12,009 --> 00:35:14,773
- Both your hands full?
- I'm afraid they are.

457
00:35:17,815 --> 00:35:20,045
Not good-bye, just good night.

458
00:35:20,151 --> 00:35:22,051
Good night.

459
00:35:22,153 --> 00:35:24,087
Come on, Lorry. Hurry up.

460
00:35:24,188 --> 00:35:26,554
Oh! Good-bye! Uh, good night.

461
00:35:26,657 --> 00:35:28,557
- Good-bye.
- Good-bye.

462
00:35:30,862 --> 00:35:33,330
Hey. How far is Baltimore
from Washington?

463
00:35:33,431 --> 00:35:36,889
Oh, uh, it's about the same as it is
from Washington to Baltimore.

464
00:35:37,001 --> 00:35:38,969
What's that address?

465
00:35:39,070 --> 00:35:42,267
Hey, I forgot to
tear it off the magazine!

466
00:35:42,373 --> 00:35:44,341
- Hey, wait! Hold that train!
- Hold that train!

467
00:35:44,442 --> 00:35:45,932
<i>Hold that train to Baltimore.!</i>

468
00:36:02,293 --> 00:36:06,252
If nothing else gets me down about this job,
climbing these stairs every day will.

469
00:36:06,364 --> 00:36:10,300
Come on. After two weeks, you oughta
be able to get your mind off New York.

470
00:36:10,401 --> 00:36:14,201
- They've probably forgotten all about us by now.
- Men are like that.

471
00:36:14,305 --> 00:36:17,468
Dud Miller's the only one who ever
treated me sweet and suggestive...

472
00:36:17,575 --> 00:36:19,543
but I loved it.

473
00:36:19,644 --> 00:36:22,670
Mmm, it was wonderful,
being a musical-comedy star...

474
00:36:22,780 --> 00:36:24,680
for a night.

475
00:36:24,782 --> 00:36:28,343
I guess it's the nicest thing you've ever been.
In your mind, I mean.

476
00:36:32,456 --> 00:36:34,924
Bureau of Aeronautics.
Uh, you got me. No, I know!

477
00:36:35,026 --> 00:36:37,017
You go down here-

478
00:36:37,128 --> 00:36:39,460
- It's them!
- What'll we do?

479
00:36:39,564 --> 00:36:41,464
Oh! Run!

480
00:36:46,237 --> 00:36:49,866
- We're trapped.
- Now where will we go?

481
00:36:49,974 --> 00:36:52,943
So you keep right on going
till you get to 3361.

482
00:36:53,044 --> 00:36:56,013
Oh, hold on. That's the old 3354.
That ain't right.

483
00:36:56,113 --> 00:36:59,082
Wait a minute. I'm wrong.
You don't turn right. You turn left.

484
00:36:59,183 --> 00:37:01,083
- Oh, the left.
- That's right.

485
00:37:01,185 --> 00:37:03,153
- You mean my right?
- No, my right, your left.

486
00:37:03,254 --> 00:37:05,586
- If I turn left, I'm right?
- No, my right, your left.

487
00:37:05,690 --> 00:37:07,590
- My left?
- That's right.

488
00:37:08,793 --> 00:37:11,261
Why didn't I stay in Missoula?

489
00:37:11,362 --> 00:37:14,729
Never mind that. Peek out and see
where they're going. Go on!

490
00:37:22,240 --> 00:37:24,265
It's safe.

491
00:37:24,375 --> 00:37:26,343
Let's get to the office quick!

492
00:37:26,444 --> 00:37:28,639
- 3369. Here we are.
- Hey, wait.

493
00:37:28,746 --> 00:37:31,772
<i>Uh, "Private. Enter 3368"?</i>

494
00:37:33,084 --> 00:37:35,985
- Well, then it must be back that way.
- I give up.

495
00:37:37,822 --> 00:37:39,722
Wait a minute.

496
00:37:44,161 --> 00:37:46,152
Oh!

497
00:37:46,264 --> 00:37:49,927
- What's the matter?
- It's them again. They're coming back!

498
00:37:50,034 --> 00:37:52,832
- Here we are- 3368.
- Yeah. Finally.

499
00:37:52,937 --> 00:37:55,405
I'll wait outside till
you're through with the chief.

500
00:37:55,506 --> 00:37:58,998
<i>- Okay. I don't think I'll be very long anyway.
- Hey, square your hat.</i>

501
00:37:59,110 --> 00:38:02,876
- Where'd they go?
- Your hero went in next door, where you have to work today.

502
00:38:02,980 --> 00:38:06,006
Oh! Well, I won't go in.
I'll quit first.

503
00:38:06,117 --> 00:38:08,745
Dooley, you youngsters
are doing a grand job.

504
00:38:08,853 --> 00:38:11,321
- I wish I could be out there with you.
- Wish you could too, Chief.

505
00:38:11,422 --> 00:38:14,448
And I would be if I could
get back on active service.

506
00:38:14,558 --> 00:38:17,026
Just think of me,
Chief Barney Briggs...

507
00:38:17,128 --> 00:38:19,358
- lashed and battened down to a desk.
- Tough.

508
00:38:19,463 --> 00:38:21,658
You know if-

509
00:38:21,766 --> 00:38:25,497
Oh, why don't I shut my mouth?
Where's that stenographer?

510
00:38:29,540 --> 00:38:32,407
That's you.

511
00:38:32,510 --> 00:38:35,968
- Well, did you have a good time in New York?
- Couldn't have asked for better.

512
00:38:36,080 --> 00:38:38,844
They gave me everything
but the sidewalks- dinners, shindigs.

513
00:38:38,949 --> 00:38:41,315
- Reel in a lot of your dough?
- Oh, no.

514
00:38:41,419 --> 00:38:43,819
Met a girl who works in a nightclub.
Everything free.

515
00:38:43,921 --> 00:38:46,549
Mmm. Danced all night every night.

516
00:38:46,657 --> 00:38:50,559
- Well, uh-
- You're lucky you didn't get back here on crutches.

517
00:38:50,661 --> 00:38:53,721
Look at that!
Plastered all over the papers with women!

518
00:38:53,831 --> 00:38:56,095
<i>- Now, Chief-
- Women- I hate 'em!</i>

519
00:38:56,200 --> 00:39:00,227
<i>I wouldn't take a second look at any of'em.</i>

520
00:39:00,338 --> 00:39:04,707
- Hello.
- Hello, Briggsey. Is my little Kewpie stepping out tonight?

521
00:39:04,809 --> 00:39:06,834
Oh, uh, yes, Admiral.

522
00:39:06,944 --> 00:39:11,210
I'll, uh- I'll, uh, do that, sir.

523
00:39:11,315 --> 00:39:15,581
- You take my advice and keep away from them.
- Now, look, Chief-

524
00:39:15,686 --> 00:39:19,520
"Dooley, Aviation Ordinance Man Second,
distinguished service.

525
00:39:19,623 --> 00:39:21,921
<i>"Casualty: compound fracture, left leg.</i>

526
00:39:22,026 --> 00:39:26,554
<i>Transferred to Washington special duty
and further medical examination. "</i>

527
00:39:26,664 --> 00:39:29,462
<i>So you stopped off in New York
and danced yourself dizzy.</i>

528
00:39:29,567 --> 00:39:32,934
<i>You know you're supposed to take care
of that bad leg? Who was she?</i>

529
00:39:33,037 --> 00:39:36,768
Beautiful! Uh, I mean, uh,
she's a musical-comedy star.

530
00:39:36,874 --> 00:39:40,332
<i>Just what I thought. She used you
to get her pictures in the paper.</i>

531
00:39:40,444 --> 00:39:43,379
<i>She ran around with you
to cash in on your publicity.</i>

532
00:39:43,481 --> 00:39:46,450
Oh, no, Chief. You've got that all wrong.
I only saw her once.

533
00:39:46,550 --> 00:39:49,246
That's once too often!
See here, Dooley!

534
00:39:49,353 --> 00:39:52,254
The navy doesn't want you kids
to make fools of yourselves.

535
00:39:52,356 --> 00:39:54,620
All this girl of yours wants
is notoriety.

536
00:39:54,725 --> 00:39:57,193
<i>She might even follow you
here to Washington.</i>

537
00:39:57,294 --> 00:39:59,262
<i>You think there's a chance?</i>

538
00:39:59,363 --> 00:40:02,491
<i>If she does, I'll have her locked up.!
I'll turn her over to the F.B. I...!</i>

539
00:40:02,600 --> 00:40:05,068
But don't you worry, Dooley.
I'll protect you.

540
00:40:05,169 --> 00:40:08,161
That's my job- to see that you fellas
aren't exploited. You don't know women.

541
00:40:08,272 --> 00:40:11,503
- No?
- No. You haven't been in the navy long enough.

542
00:40:11,609 --> 00:40:13,839
But you can depend on me.
I know.

543
00:40:13,944 --> 00:40:18,142
- Swell. Got any telephone numbers?
- I've got a book full of tel-

544
00:40:18,249 --> 00:40:21,548
Wait a minute. What do you mean?
You're here on business.

545
00:40:21,652 --> 00:40:24,621
The Bureau of Aeronautics wants
a report on everything you've learned...

546
00:40:24,722 --> 00:40:26,690
aboutJaps and Jap tactics.

547
00:40:26,791 --> 00:40:29,316
Here, this young lady will take down
your report in shorthand.

548
00:40:29,427 --> 00:40:32,396
- What's your name, miss?
- Jones.

549
00:40:32,496 --> 00:40:36,057
<i>- Little late, aren't you?
- Yes, sir.</i>

550
00:40:36,167 --> 00:40:38,067
Here's my department record.

551
00:40:38,169 --> 00:40:40,137
- Miss Jones, this is Mr. Dooley.
- How do you do?

552
00:40:40,237 --> 00:40:42,865
You work with him to get his report out.
Use that office in there.

553
00:40:42,973 --> 00:40:44,873
- Yes, sir.
- That's all.

554
00:40:44,975 --> 00:40:48,342
- Now, get to work and keep your mind on it.
- Okay, Chief.

555
00:40:53,384 --> 00:40:55,818
- Shall I take dictation, or would you rather-
- Hmm?

556
00:40:55,920 --> 00:40:58,787
- I said, shall I take notes or-
- Do you dance?

557
00:40:58,889 --> 00:41:01,153
- Not during office hours.
- Oh.

558
00:41:01,258 --> 00:41:03,954
Well, there was something
about you that-

559
00:41:04,061 --> 00:41:06,586
I mean, it reminded me of-

560
00:41:10,401 --> 00:41:12,301
No. Couldn't be.

561
00:41:15,673 --> 00:41:18,870
- I'm ready, Mr. Dooley.
- Look, I don't wanna work.

562
00:41:18,976 --> 00:41:21,444
I want to go to Baltimore.
Where is it?

563
00:41:21,545 --> 00:41:25,072
- I think it's over there behind the navy yard.
- Well, that's something.

564
00:41:25,182 --> 00:41:28,151
I'll be a little closer to her
when I'm in my bunk.

565
00:41:29,987 --> 00:41:33,081
Miss Jones,
have you ever been in love?

566
00:41:33,190 --> 00:41:35,818
- Well, l-
- No, you look too sensible.

567
00:41:35,926 --> 00:41:38,360
For days I've been
walking around in circles.

568
00:41:38,462 --> 00:41:41,761
- I've even been talking to myself.
- You have?

569
00:41:41,866 --> 00:41:45,165
That's the way you get.
I met a wonderful girl and lost her address.

570
00:41:45,269 --> 00:41:47,601
That's why I have to go to Baltimore.

571
00:41:47,705 --> 00:41:49,605
She's staying there someplace.

572
00:41:49,707 --> 00:41:51,607
I've got to find her.

573
00:41:51,709 --> 00:41:54,007
You know, the first time we met...

574
00:41:54,111 --> 00:41:56,409
the first time we looked at each other...

575
00:41:56,514 --> 00:42:00,280
it was just like- like coming in
with your wings flapping.

576
00:42:00,384 --> 00:42:03,353
- Oh, that's beautiful.
- Oh, she's gorgeous.

577
00:42:03,454 --> 00:42:05,786
She- She takes your breath away.

578
00:42:05,890 --> 00:42:09,018
She makes you feel, well-

579
00:42:09,126 --> 00:42:11,924
- Were you ever tattooed?
- No, but-

580
00:42:12,029 --> 00:42:14,497
Well, that's just the way
she makes you feel-

581
00:42:14,598 --> 00:42:18,056
<i>like somebody's
sticking needles in you all over.</i>

582
00:42:18,168 --> 00:42:20,636
Am I boring you?

583
00:42:20,738 --> 00:42:22,706
Gosh, no. Oh, no, sir.

584
00:42:22,806 --> 00:42:26,037
Ah, what's the use?
I'll never find her in Baltimore.

585
00:42:26,143 --> 00:42:28,270
I'd have to go around ringing doorbells.

586
00:42:28,379 --> 00:42:31,212
But perhaps if she knows
you're here in the navy department...

587
00:42:31,315 --> 00:42:33,783
and anxious to see her again,
she might telephone you.

588
00:42:33,884 --> 00:42:37,479
- Do you think she would?
- Well, if I were in love as much as you seem to be.

589
00:42:37,588 --> 00:42:39,488
Oh, I'm off my top!

590
00:42:39,590 --> 00:42:41,490
Well, I'd phone you.

591
00:42:41,592 --> 00:42:43,890
Oh, Miss Jones!
You've saved my life.

592
00:42:43,994 --> 00:42:47,361
<i>You're a great girl, wonderful.
I'll never forget.</i>

593
00:42:47,464 --> 00:42:49,898
Hey, can you leave your work
for a minute?

594
00:42:50,000 --> 00:42:52,195
Oh. Miss Jones, Mr. Miller.

595
00:42:52,303 --> 00:42:54,931
Hiya. The O.W.I.
wants you right away.

596
00:42:55,039 --> 00:42:57,803
Miss Jones thinks Miss Lorraine
might call me up from Baltimore.

597
00:42:57,908 --> 00:43:00,376
- Hey, suppose she does while I'm gone?
- I'll take the message.

598
00:43:00,477 --> 00:43:02,911
Swell. Don't leave the phone,
not an inch. Tell her l-

599
00:43:03,013 --> 00:43:05,914
Tell her I'll be right back.
Get her number. Come on.

600
00:43:07,251 --> 00:43:09,845
- Have I got my fingers crossed.
- Didn't you tumble?

601
00:43:09,954 --> 00:43:12,081
- Tumble? What do you mean?
- In there- that girl.

602
00:43:12,189 --> 00:43:14,987
<i>Isn't she the one we met in New York?
The "Remember Me" girl.</i>

603
00:43:15,092 --> 00:43:18,357
What are you talkin' about? That's Miss Jones.
She typewrites with her fingers.

604
00:43:18,462 --> 00:43:21,488
Oh, yeah? For two girls to look that much
alike, she'd have to do it with mirrors.

605
00:43:21,599 --> 00:43:24,193
If she was the same one,
what would she be doing here as a steno?

606
00:43:24,301 --> 00:43:26,201
Why would she- Oh, hiya, Chief.

607
00:43:26,303 --> 00:43:29,272
I thought you were working.
What's the matter? Isn't that girl all right?

608
00:43:29,373 --> 00:43:32,001
- Absolutely. I got called over to the O.W.I.
- Excuse me, Chief.

609
00:43:32,109 --> 00:43:34,407
That girl in there-
How long's she been working here?

610
00:43:34,511 --> 00:43:37,275
- Her report card says a week. She's from out of town.
- New York?

611
00:43:37,381 --> 00:43:41,181
No, she came here on government transportation
direct from Missoula, Missouri.

612
00:43:41,285 --> 00:43:43,549
Highly recommended.
Don't you two try to start anything.

613
00:43:43,654 --> 00:43:45,554
Oh, no, no, no. We wouldn't-

614
00:43:45,656 --> 00:43:47,556
Oh!

615
00:43:50,861 --> 00:43:52,761
Extension 47.

616
00:43:55,199 --> 00:43:57,633
Hello, Kay?
Everything's wonderful!

617
00:43:57,735 --> 00:44:01,466
I'm gonna take Mr. Dooley's report,
and he loves me. He's been trying to find me!

618
00:44:01,572 --> 00:44:04,504
- Didn't he recognize you?
- No, he doesn't know I'm me.

619
00:44:04,608 --> 00:44:07,076
But he loves me
ever since he first met me.

620
00:44:07,177 --> 00:44:11,238
But, Lorry, what'll you do now?
You can't let him go on thinking that-

621
00:44:11,348 --> 00:44:15,307
But I have to! He's crazy about
Laura Lorraine, not Laura Jones, and-

622
00:44:15,419 --> 00:44:19,412
<i>Why, yes, of course I'll give him your message.</i>

623
00:44:19,523 --> 00:44:21,548
- Good-bye.
- Who was that?

624
00:44:21,659 --> 00:44:23,991
Why, Miss Lorraine.

625
00:44:24,094 --> 00:44:27,063
Miss Lorraine?
Why did you let her go? Why did you-

626
00:44:27,164 --> 00:44:29,132
I told her you were out of the office.

627
00:44:29,233 --> 00:44:31,201
But I wasn't. I was right there.

628
00:44:31,301 --> 00:44:33,269
She said she was leaving Baltimore
for Washington...

629
00:44:33,370 --> 00:44:35,838
and if you wanted to,
you could meet her tonight.

630
00:44:35,939 --> 00:44:39,397
- Tonight? Where?
- In front of the statue of Benjamin Franklin at 8:00.

631
00:44:39,510 --> 00:44:41,637
Miss Jones, you don't know
what you're saying.

632
00:44:41,745 --> 00:44:44,213
I'm the happiest guy in the world!

633
00:44:44,314 --> 00:44:48,375
Wait a minute. You've gotta help me.
Where will I take her?

634
00:44:48,485 --> 00:44:51,784
Every place in Washington
is packed with people.

635
00:44:51,889 --> 00:44:53,857
I want to be alone with her...

636
00:44:53,957 --> 00:44:58,087
someplace, if I take her in my arms,
she'll naturally cuddle up.

637
00:44:58,195 --> 00:45:00,186
Maybe a carriage ride.

638
00:45:00,297 --> 00:45:03,164
No, the driver hears everything you say.

639
00:45:03,267 --> 00:45:06,566
- A walk in the park?
- That's worse. Too many people.

640
00:45:06,670 --> 00:45:09,730
- You hear everything they say.
- I've got it.

641
00:45:09,840 --> 00:45:11,740
- What?
- A moonlight picnic.

642
00:45:11,842 --> 00:45:15,403
If you could have someone put up a box
supper for two and get a portable radio-

643
00:45:15,512 --> 00:45:18,879
- I can get those all right, but where in
Washington- - Why not right on the mall?

644
00:45:18,982 --> 00:45:21,450
With moonlight on the water,
it would be awfully romantic...

645
00:45:21,552 --> 00:45:23,850
and, I've heard,
sometimes awfully lonesome.

646
00:45:23,954 --> 00:45:26,548
Miss Jones, you're wonderful!
You're terrific!

647
00:45:26,657 --> 00:45:28,557
You're-

648
00:45:28,659 --> 00:45:31,127
Just showing her
a Japanese stranglehold, Chief.

649
00:45:31,228 --> 00:45:35,028
If this keeps up, she won't be here
long enough to use it.

650
00:45:59,690 --> 00:46:01,590
Penny for your thoughts?

651
00:46:01,692 --> 00:46:05,992
I was thinking of your secretary and what
a lovely person she was to suggest this place.

652
00:46:06,096 --> 00:46:08,894
It must be nice to have
such a sweet girl in your office.

653
00:46:08,999 --> 00:46:12,298
I'd much rather think
of the sweet girl I have in my arms.

654
00:46:12,402 --> 00:46:15,132
I wonder if you'll always feel
that way towards me, Tommy.

655
00:46:15,239 --> 00:46:17,833
- Always.
- Even if something happened?

656
00:46:17,941 --> 00:46:21,638
- Of course, darling.
- I wish I could be sure.

657
00:46:21,745 --> 00:46:24,009
What makes you say that?

658
00:46:24,114 --> 00:46:26,173
Oh, I don't know. l-

659
00:46:26,283 --> 00:46:28,183
- Lorraine.
- Yes?

660
00:46:30,320 --> 00:46:32,754
When a fella's liable to go away...

661
00:46:32,856 --> 00:46:35,484
maybe for a long time...

662
00:46:35,592 --> 00:46:38,060
do you think he has a right to-

663
00:46:38,162 --> 00:46:41,620
well, to ask a girl to wait for him?

664
00:46:41,732 --> 00:46:44,257
If he loves her, I think he has.

665
00:46:48,539 --> 00:46:51,667
But you're joining the U.S.O. show.
You don't know where you'll be or-

666
00:46:51,775 --> 00:46:54,175
I haven't had much luck
with the U.S.O. show, Tommy.

667
00:46:54,278 --> 00:46:56,906
There's too many big stars
ahead of me.

668
00:46:57,014 --> 00:47:00,347
I was thinking of going back home
to Missour- uh, Kansas City...

669
00:47:00,450 --> 00:47:02,418
and- and forgetting the stage.

670
00:47:02,519 --> 00:47:05,386
That's a fine thing.
With all your talent? Why, it's ridiculous.

671
00:47:05,489 --> 00:47:09,186
Oh, no, it isn't.
I don't mind giving up the stage.

672
00:47:09,293 --> 00:47:12,729
Besides, Washington wouldn't
be the same if you went away.

673
00:47:12,830 --> 00:47:14,798
<i>Ladies and gentlemen...</i>

674
00:47:14,898 --> 00:47:17,366
<i>you've been listening to the music
of Charlie Spivak and his band...</i>

675
00:47:17,467 --> 00:47:20,834
<i>coming to you from the opening tonight of
Washington's newest and smartest nightclub...</i>

676
00:47:20,938 --> 00:47:22,997
the Club Diplomacy.

677
00:47:23,106 --> 00:47:26,303
What's the matter with us?
There's the solution to our whole problem.

678
00:47:26,410 --> 00:47:29,504
Eddie Hall! Why, he's right here
in Washington opening up his club tonight.

679
00:47:29,613 --> 00:47:31,581
That Miss, um-
you know, the singer-

680
00:47:31,682 --> 00:47:34,310
She's been sending me telegrams
and letters, begging me to come.

681
00:47:34,418 --> 00:47:37,387
- But, Tommy- - We'll grab a taxi
and go over to the Club Diplomacy.

682
00:47:37,487 --> 00:47:39,387
- But listen-
- Not to one word.

683
00:47:39,489 --> 00:47:43,357
I'm gonna make Eddie Hall give you a break
if it takes an act of Congress.

684
00:47:48,665 --> 00:47:52,192
<i>All kidding aside, folks, you've made me
the happiest boy in the world.</i>

685
00:47:52,302 --> 00:47:55,271
<i>Why, just two minutes ago
Senator Novacall stopped me, and he said...</i>

686
00:47:55,372 --> 00:47:57,897
<i>"Mr. Hall"-
He called me by my maiden name.</i>

687
00:47:58,008 --> 00:48:00,238
"Mr. Hall," he said,
"I want to congratulate you.

688
00:48:00,344 --> 00:48:03,472
Your opening is the biggest
we've ever had in Washington."

689
00:48:06,049 --> 00:48:09,416
Oh.
Now I know what he meant.

690
00:48:11,521 --> 00:48:14,649
And now, ladies and gentlemen,
that cheerful little earful of corn...

691
00:48:14,758 --> 00:48:17,090
Miss Molly McKay!

692
00:48:30,307 --> 00:48:33,105
Ladies and gentlemen
attention, please

693
00:48:33,210 --> 00:48:35,838
You've got to listen to me

694
00:48:35,946 --> 00:48:39,382
Here's an extra special communiqué

695
00:48:39,483 --> 00:48:41,451
Just arrived today

696
00:48:41,551 --> 00:48:45,351
From Washington, D.C.

697
00:48:56,600 --> 00:48:59,398
Pretty little milkmaid
milk that cow

698
00:48:59,503 --> 00:49:02,267
Say there, you
grab ahold of that plow

699
00:49:02,372 --> 00:49:05,466
We gotta do a heap of farmin' now

700
00:49:05,575 --> 00:49:08,100
We're on a Yankee-Doodle hayride

701
00:49:08,211 --> 00:49:11,078
Run your little tractor
Stack that wheat

702
00:49:11,181 --> 00:49:13,979
Your big boy and his buddy must eat

703
00:49:14,084 --> 00:49:17,281
We need a lot of starch
for marching feet

704
00:49:17,387 --> 00:49:19,582
We're on a Yankee-Doodle hayride

705
00:49:19,690 --> 00:49:23,217
Oh, there ain't gonna
be no hoedown

706
00:49:23,327 --> 00:49:25,921
Till we knock the foe down

707
00:49:26,029 --> 00:49:28,395
Neighbor
we just can't slow down

708
00:49:28,498 --> 00:49:31,626
Got to go
Got to go like blazes

709
00:49:31,735 --> 00:49:34,727
Soldiers in khaki
Sailors in blue

710
00:49:34,838 --> 00:49:37,602
Cannot be any prouder than you

711
00:49:37,708 --> 00:49:40,802
A pair of overalls is a uniform too

712
00:49:40,911 --> 00:49:43,038
We're on a Yankee-Doodle hayride

713
00:49:51,922 --> 00:49:55,085
Hey, hey
What do you say

714
00:49:55,192 --> 00:49:57,990
We gotta have beans
and gotta have tomatoes

715
00:49:58,095 --> 00:50:00,893
Come along, rain
We gotta have crops

716
00:50:00,998 --> 00:50:04,126
lowa corn and Idaho potatoes

717
00:50:04,234 --> 00:50:07,169
Fatten that calf
We got to have chops

718
00:50:07,270 --> 00:50:09,704
If you want to win
you've gotta pitch in

719
00:50:09,806 --> 00:50:13,037
If you want to pitch in
then you've gotta pitch hay

720
00:50:13,143 --> 00:50:16,112
Hey, hey
Are you goin' away

721
00:50:16,213 --> 00:50:18,773
Way down yonder in a cornfield

722
00:50:42,773 --> 00:50:45,571
Soldiers in khaki
Sailors in blue

723
00:50:45,675 --> 00:50:48,542
Cannot be any prouder than you

724
00:50:48,645 --> 00:50:52,240
A pair of overalls is a uniform too

725
00:50:53,650 --> 00:50:55,982
Your Uncle Sam is calling you

726
00:50:56,086 --> 00:50:58,953
To come and hitch your wagon
to a Yankee-Doodle

727
00:50:59,056 --> 00:51:01,547
Cock-a-doodle-doodle hayride

728
00:53:23,433 --> 00:53:26,891
Having you folks drop in is all I needed
to make the evening complete.

729
00:53:27,003 --> 00:53:30,530
- You're sweet to say that.
- Looks like you're having a big opening night, Eddie.

730
00:53:30,640 --> 00:53:33,108
A sellout.

731
00:53:33,210 --> 00:53:36,077
Hey, what's going on
between you two anyway?

732
00:53:39,049 --> 00:53:42,678
Hmm. I get it.
Well, he's a great guy, Miss Lorraine.

733
00:53:42,786 --> 00:53:45,914
I've known this son of a gun ever since
he wore three-cornered pants.

734
00:53:46,022 --> 00:53:49,822
As a matter of fact, I loaned you
the dough to buy your first long ones.

735
00:53:49,926 --> 00:53:51,826
- That's right.
- Yeah.

736
00:53:51,928 --> 00:53:55,386
I guess that shows you where I stand.
And you think he wouldn't do me a favor?

737
00:53:55,498 --> 00:53:58,524
- Favor? Are you short? Do you need dough?
- Oh, no, no.

738
00:53:58,635 --> 00:54:01,297
- There is something else.
- Just ask. You've got it.

739
00:54:01,404 --> 00:54:04,805
- You're going out on a limb.
- For you, I'll chop it off.

740
00:54:04,908 --> 00:54:06,432
- Mr. Hall, l-
- You're sure?

741
00:54:06,543 --> 00:54:08,943
Positive. Ask me anything. It's done.

742
00:54:09,045 --> 00:54:12,071
Okay. I want you to put
Miss Lorraine in your show.

743
00:54:12,182 --> 00:54:15,743
- Did you say-
- Remember how good she was in New York?

744
00:54:15,852 --> 00:54:17,979
She'll be twice as good here
in Washington.

745
00:54:18,088 --> 00:54:21,546
Didn't I tell you he'd do it?
Didn't I say he was a great guy?

746
00:54:21,658 --> 00:54:24,218
I think you're one
of the nicest persons in the world...

747
00:54:24,327 --> 00:54:26,795
and I appreciate
what you've done for me.

748
00:54:26,896 --> 00:54:29,865
- What's the matter? You sick?
- Oh, no. No, no.

749
00:54:29,966 --> 00:54:34,096
Just a little dizzy from climbing out
on that limb so fast.

750
00:54:46,249 --> 00:54:49,150
- What hit me, a P-38?
- I hit you.

751
00:54:49,252 --> 00:54:53,484
When you signed up that Lorraine girl,
you didn't invite trouble with me, you ensured it.

752
00:54:53,590 --> 00:54:55,956
Now, wait a minute.
Let's talk this thing over sensibly, Molly.

753
00:54:56,059 --> 00:54:59,825
Stay down for a full count or I'll hang a shanty
on your other eye to look like a duplex!

754
00:54:59,929 --> 00:55:01,897
- I'll go for help!
- Help nothing, sister.

755
00:55:01,998 --> 00:55:05,627
You come back in a few minutes, and what's
left of him you can kick under a rug.

756
00:55:05,735 --> 00:55:08,863
Listen, you got this thing all wrong.
I was forced to sign up Miss Lorraine.

757
00:55:08,972 --> 00:55:10,940
Tommy Dooley made me do it.

758
00:55:11,041 --> 00:55:14,010
- Oh, yes? What did he use for persuasion?
- Friendship.

759
00:55:14,110 --> 00:55:18,069
What do you think? I gave in because he was
gonna hit me with a piece of wet lettuce?

760
00:55:18,181 --> 00:55:20,615
I don't care why you gave in!
All I know is I'm through.

761
00:55:20,717 --> 00:55:23,117
- I'm walking out on you right now!
- Molly!

762
00:55:23,219 --> 00:55:25,847
That Lorraine dame took Dooley
away from me in New York...

763
00:55:25,955 --> 00:55:28,924
but I'll choke before I let her parade
in front of me in Washington!

764
00:55:29,025 --> 00:55:31,323
But she isn't gonna
parade herself in front of ya.

765
00:55:31,428 --> 00:55:34,397
You're the star of my show.
She can't compare with ya.

766
00:55:34,497 --> 00:55:37,762
You're my drawing card. Molly!

767
00:55:37,867 --> 00:55:40,563
- Don't you think anything of me?
- Anything?

768
00:55:40,670 --> 00:55:44,128
Everything.
Everything I can think of!

769
00:55:44,240 --> 00:55:47,698
Wait a minute.
For once in your life, be sensible.

770
00:55:47,811 --> 00:55:50,880
- Mmm.
- Even if it's only for the novelty.

771
00:55:53,183 --> 00:55:55,811
Excuse me.

772
00:55:55,919 --> 00:55:58,717
Mmm. A marine.
And "excuse me," he says.

773
00:55:58,822 --> 00:56:01,484
How do you want him to come in?
Throwing hand grenades?

774
00:56:01,591 --> 00:56:04,253
- How do you do?
- What can I do for you?

775
00:56:04,361 --> 00:56:07,626
- I'm looking for someone- Miss Lorraine,
as you call her. - It's her again.

776
00:56:07,731 --> 00:56:10,063
- She gets 'em all.
- Look, brother, will you please go away?

777
00:56:10,166 --> 00:56:14,125
- I got all the trouble I can use.
- Yeah? Well, you're gonna get some more if I don't find her.

778
00:56:14,237 --> 00:56:17,070
- I happen to be engaged to her.
- That's fine. Now, if you'll just run al-

779
00:56:17,173 --> 00:56:19,164
- You're engaged to her?
- That's right.

780
00:56:19,275 --> 00:56:21,903
- Are you sure?
- Of course I'm sure.

781
00:56:22,011 --> 00:56:25,913
She gave me this the night
I took her to the train.

782
00:56:26,015 --> 00:56:28,108
- You took her to the train?
- Look, bud, you got the wrong party.

783
00:56:28,218 --> 00:56:30,914
- You didn't take her to the train that night.
- I tell you I did.

784
00:56:31,020 --> 00:56:33,250
I wasn't lettin' those guys
beat my time.

785
00:56:33,356 --> 00:56:35,483
- But they took her to the train too.
- They horned in.

786
00:56:35,592 --> 00:56:37,492
She didn't want 'em.

787
00:56:37,594 --> 00:56:40,188
She says, "George, I'm just bein' nice to them
'cause they're doing their bit.

788
00:56:40,296 --> 00:56:42,196
You're the only one I love."

789
00:56:42,298 --> 00:56:45,131
- She said that to you?
- Sure. Course, she's nice to all the fellas.

790
00:56:45,235 --> 00:56:47,760
That's why she's
such a popular pinup girl.

791
00:56:47,871 --> 00:56:50,738
- Thousands of guys have her picture.
- Pinup girl?

792
00:56:50,840 --> 00:56:54,367
You mean I've got a popular pinup girl in my show,
and I'm not letting the public know?

793
00:56:55,578 --> 00:56:57,910
Miss Lorraine
won't be here until tonight...

794
00:56:58,014 --> 00:57:00,380
so why don't you and I sort of plan
a little surprise for her?

795
00:57:00,483 --> 00:57:02,474
- Well, that's fine.
- Pardon us.

796
00:57:02,585 --> 00:57:05,383
Wait a minute, Molly.
You're not going anyplace with him.

797
00:57:05,488 --> 00:57:08,252
- If she wants to, who's gonna stop her?
- Yeah. You keep out of this.

798
00:57:08,358 --> 00:57:12,727
War is war. Oh, and by the way,
reserve a table for Miss Lorraine's fiancé.

799
00:57:12,829 --> 00:57:15,024
He's going to be
our honored guest tonight.

800
00:57:15,131 --> 00:57:16,723
You look good, Ed.

801
00:57:22,071 --> 00:57:24,062
- Good evening.
- Good evening.

802
00:59:52,722 --> 00:59:55,020
Once too often

803
00:59:55,124 --> 00:59:58,491
You're gonna step out
once too often

804
00:59:58,595 --> 01:00:01,428
I'm gettin' mighty sick and tired

805
01:00:01,531 --> 01:00:05,900
Of totin' the torch for you

806
01:00:06,002 --> 01:00:09,438
So just be careful
brother

807
01:00:09,539 --> 01:00:12,770
I, too
can find another

808
01:00:12,875 --> 01:00:15,605
Remember anything that you do

809
01:00:15,712 --> 01:00:19,375
I can do too

810
01:00:19,482 --> 01:00:21,848
Once too often

811
01:00:21,951 --> 01:00:24,715
I'll get the go-by once too often

812
01:00:24,821 --> 01:00:27,915
And then you'll have
to change your tune

813
01:00:28,024 --> 01:00:32,427
And sing in a different key

814
01:00:32,528 --> 01:00:35,793
That line that you've been usin'

815
01:00:35,898 --> 01:00:38,628
Will cease to be amusin'

816
01:00:38,735 --> 01:00:40,669
It's gonna boomerang

817
01:00:40,770 --> 01:00:45,400
When you come lookin' for me

818
01:00:45,508 --> 01:00:49,103
Say, you're a wizard
when it comes to cryin'

819
01:00:49,212 --> 01:00:52,375
A master in the art of alibi-in'

820
01:00:52,482 --> 01:00:55,110
Go on and do
your tall and fancy lyin'

821
01:00:55,218 --> 01:00:58,915
Baby, but you will say you're sorry

822
01:00:59,022 --> 01:01:00,922
Once too often

823
01:01:01,024 --> 01:01:04,118
You're gonna weep
but I won't soften

824
01:01:04,227 --> 01:01:06,957
You're gonna whimper like a pup

825
01:01:07,063 --> 01:01:10,965
The day I catch up with you

826
01:01:11,067 --> 01:01:14,833
Step out, go on and show off

827
01:01:14,937 --> 01:01:17,963
Some night the lid will blow off

828
01:01:18,074 --> 01:01:23,444
You're gonna give my heart
the business once too often

829
01:03:16,092 --> 01:03:18,720
- Stick around. I'll be back in a minute.
- Hey. Where you goin', sailor?

830
01:03:18,828 --> 01:03:21,058
I'm going backstage and pop
a mighty important question.

831
01:03:21,164 --> 01:03:23,758
Keep your fingers crossed
that I get the right answer.

832
01:03:26,536 --> 01:03:29,733
Come on now, girls. You go
and get ready for your next number.

833
01:03:32,108 --> 01:03:35,271
- Oh, Tommy, can you spare a minute?
- Well, l-l-l-

834
01:03:35,378 --> 01:03:38,438
I've got a surprise. It's for Miss Lorraine.
I thought maybe you'd want to get in on it.

835
01:03:38,548 --> 01:03:42,678
- Well, you bet your life I would. What is it?
- I'll show you.

836
01:03:44,120 --> 01:03:46,452
Tommy Dooley, meet George Davis.

837
01:03:46,556 --> 01:03:48,490
- How are ya?
- Very well, thanks.

838
01:03:48,591 --> 01:03:50,991
- How are you?
- Isn't this wonderful, you meeting him?

839
01:03:51,093 --> 01:03:53,960
Well, sure, but I don't quite understand.
What's this all about?

840
01:03:54,063 --> 01:03:57,032
Well, George is Miss Lorraine's fiancé,
only she doesn't know it yet.

841
01:03:57,133 --> 01:03:59,294
Oh, yes, she does.
She told me so herself.

842
01:03:59,402 --> 01:04:01,563
- She doesn't know you're here.
- I don't get this.

843
01:04:01,671 --> 01:04:03,571
She doesn't know he's in town.

844
01:04:03,673 --> 01:04:07,200
We were gonna wait until after her number,
then all of us were gonna walk in on her.

845
01:04:07,310 --> 01:04:11,212
Will she be happy- success in the show
and getting her boyfriend back in one night.

846
01:04:11,314 --> 01:04:13,976
And she deserves it.
She's got what it takes.

847
01:04:14,083 --> 01:04:17,052
- That, my friend, is an understatement.
- You a friend of hers too?

848
01:04:17,153 --> 01:04:20,145
In a way. Course, it was only casual.
Very casual.

849
01:04:20,256 --> 01:04:24,420
Thanks, Molly, for saving me
from doing something very silly.

850
01:04:24,527 --> 01:04:27,758
Glad to have seen you.
Best of luck to you both.

851
01:04:30,066 --> 01:04:32,125
He's not a very sociable guy, is he?

852
01:04:32,235 --> 01:04:37,002
He's been looking out a porthole too long.
What are we waitin' for?

853
01:04:37,106 --> 01:04:41,600
I'll change all my advertising. I'll bill you
as the nation's number-one pinup girl.

854
01:04:41,711 --> 01:04:44,271
Everybody in Washington'll be packin' the joint.
I'll give you the biggest publ-

855
01:04:44,380 --> 01:04:48,180
- Surprise! Look who's here.
- Lorry!

856
01:04:48,284 --> 01:04:51,014
- How do you do?
- Don't you remember me?

857
01:04:51,120 --> 01:04:55,386
Oh, yes. Of course.
It was at a dinner party, wasn't it?

858
01:04:55,491 --> 01:04:58,619
- Now, was it in Pittsburgh or-
- It was in Missoula at a dance, and you know it.

859
01:04:58,728 --> 01:05:00,696
You're engaged to him.
Don't you remember?

860
01:05:00,796 --> 01:05:04,459
Molly, if this is gonna be a fight,
remember it's a private one.

861
01:05:04,567 --> 01:05:07,092
George! Now I place you!

862
01:05:07,203 --> 01:05:09,467
Well, it's about time
we got to know each other better.

863
01:05:09,572 --> 01:05:11,802
And maybe it's about time
we had something understood.

864
01:05:11,908 --> 01:05:16,208
See, I'm engaged to 500 boys, but that doesn't
say I'm gonna marry each one of them.

865
01:05:16,312 --> 01:05:18,212
- I'll say you're not.
- No.

866
01:05:18,314 --> 01:05:21,283
You can include Tommy Dooley in that 500, too,
because you're not gonna marry him either.

867
01:05:21,384 --> 01:05:23,944
- I fixed that.
- What do you mean, you fixed it?

868
01:05:24,053 --> 01:05:26,886
I introduced George to Tommy,
and I told him you two were engaged.

869
01:05:26,989 --> 01:05:29,856
You did? Where is he?

870
01:05:29,959 --> 01:05:32,894
From the way he left, by now,
he's probably flying over the equator.

871
01:05:32,995 --> 01:05:34,963
Oh.

872
01:05:35,064 --> 01:05:37,464
Now you've really fixed it.

873
01:05:37,566 --> 01:05:41,002
Well, how did I know
she was engaged to 500 other guys?

874
01:05:41,103 --> 01:05:43,128
You didn't wanna
get married anyway, did ya?

875
01:05:45,308 --> 01:05:49,438
"Dear Tommy, it is hard to explain
what happened last night.

876
01:05:49,545 --> 01:05:52,139
"There is so much
I would like to tell you.

877
01:05:52,248 --> 01:05:55,376
"If you will see me,
I'm sure I can make you understand...

878
01:05:55,484 --> 01:05:58,317
"and you won't think so badly of me.

879
01:05:58,421 --> 01:06:03,085
"Please leave a message with your stenographer.
I will phone her.

880
01:06:03,192 --> 01:06:05,592
<i>Sincerely, Laura Lorraine. "</i>

881
01:06:08,798 --> 01:06:12,234
Miss Jones, if Miss Lorraine calls,
tell her I don't want any part of her.

882
01:06:12,335 --> 01:06:14,394
- You don't?
- Never.

883
01:06:14,503 --> 01:06:17,028
- That's being awfully hard-hearted.
- She made a fool out of me.

884
01:06:17,139 --> 01:06:19,699
What do you expect me to do?
Congratulate her?

885
01:06:19,809 --> 01:06:24,075
Maybe you don't understand.
I think her letter was beautiful.

886
01:06:24,180 --> 01:06:27,946
- I'm sure she's terribly unhappy.
- Don't let her fool you.

887
01:06:28,050 --> 01:06:31,451
She's probably laughing up her sleeve.
She's engaged to another guy.

888
01:06:31,554 --> 01:06:36,514
The chief was right. He told me
she was playing me for a chump all the time.

889
01:06:38,027 --> 01:06:41,861
- Why are you sticking up for her?
- I'm not.

890
01:06:41,964 --> 01:06:45,422
I think she's a silly person who
probably didn't realize how serious-

891
01:06:45,534 --> 01:06:49,026
Baloney. Let's skip the whole thing.
I don't wanna think about it.

892
01:06:49,138 --> 01:06:52,574
It's over. From now on,
it's a thing of the past.

893
01:06:52,675 --> 01:06:55,371
What did I tell you,
you irresponsible, seagoing Romeo?

894
01:06:55,478 --> 01:06:57,571
Look at that. She's done it.

895
01:06:57,680 --> 01:07:00,911
And she had the colossal gall to pull it right
under the nose of the navy department.

896
01:07:01,017 --> 01:07:05,283
She's followed you to Washington.
Didn't I tell you she was out to exploit you?

897
01:07:05,388 --> 01:07:08,380
Wait a minute, Chief.
You don't have to worry about her anymore.

898
01:07:08,491 --> 01:07:11,892
I brushed her off for good last night.

899
01:07:11,994 --> 01:07:16,693
One with a bow line like that?
How could you do it?

900
01:07:16,799 --> 01:07:20,200
What's the difference? All that matters
is we're washed up, and that's final.

901
01:07:20,302 --> 01:07:22,236
<i>- You sure?
- Positively.</i>

902
01:07:22,338 --> 01:07:25,239
She's out of my life forever.

903
01:07:25,341 --> 01:07:27,639
Well.

904
01:07:29,478 --> 01:07:32,606
<i>- Forever?
- Yes. Forever.</i>

905
01:07:34,250 --> 01:07:36,844
I had it coming.

906
01:07:36,952 --> 01:07:39,682
I was a sap to fall for an actress
in the first place.

907
01:07:39,789 --> 01:07:42,053
I'm not the type,
and I should've known it.

908
01:07:42,158 --> 01:07:45,958
- But you're being so hasty.
- I'm not being hasty. I'm just being sensible.

909
01:07:46,062 --> 01:07:49,520
If I had a brain in my head,
I'd fall for a girl like- like you-

910
01:07:49,632 --> 01:07:53,830
a girl who's sincere and honest
and has both feet on the ground.

911
01:07:53,936 --> 01:07:56,496
- Did you say like me?
- Yes. You.

912
01:07:56,605 --> 01:07:59,233
You wouldn't think of deceiving
a fellow or lying to him.

913
01:07:59,341 --> 01:08:01,400
You're the kind of a girl a fellow needs.

914
01:08:01,510 --> 01:08:03,535
The ceiling's gonna fall
right down on my head.

915
01:08:03,646 --> 01:08:06,638
- What'd you say?
- Oh- Oh, l- Oh-

916
01:08:06,749 --> 01:08:08,717
I said I broke the lead.

917
01:08:10,886 --> 01:08:14,982
Hey, wait a minute.
What are you doing tonight?

918
01:08:15,091 --> 01:08:18,458
- Oh, I've got a date.
- Break it. I'm taking you to dinner.

919
01:08:18,561 --> 01:08:21,792
Have you ever been
to the Club Diplomacy?

920
01:08:21,897 --> 01:08:24,957
- Well, not exactly. l-
- Well, that's where we're going.

921
01:08:25,067 --> 01:08:28,036
<i>- Dooley, come in here.
- Okay, Chief. Coming.</i>

922
01:08:28,137 --> 01:08:30,105
I'll be back in a minute.

923
01:08:33,309 --> 01:08:36,073
Talk yourself out of this one,
Laura Jones.

924
01:08:40,616 --> 01:08:42,607
<i>Your hat, sir.</i>

925
01:08:52,261 --> 01:08:55,753
Oh, I'm sorry, Mr. Dooley, but I don't
think it's right for us to come here.

926
01:08:55,865 --> 01:08:58,732
After all, I'm your stenographer,
and people might talk.

927
01:08:58,834 --> 01:09:01,234
Nonsense. You're not going
to run into anybody you know.

928
01:09:01,337 --> 01:09:04,773
And besides, they'll probably
stick us behind a marble pillar.

929
01:09:04,874 --> 01:09:07,604
- Telephone, Mr. Hall. They're calling you from backstage.
- Thanks.

930
01:09:07,710 --> 01:09:09,837
- Hi, Eddie.
- Tommy.

931
01:09:09,945 --> 01:09:12,038
<i>I want to talk to you.
Be with you in just a second.</i>

932
01:09:12,148 --> 01:09:17,142
- Mario, get Mr. Dooley a ringside table.
- This way, please.

933
01:09:17,253 --> 01:09:20,051
- Nice break.
- Mmm.

934
01:09:20,156 --> 01:09:22,886
What?
Miss Lorraine isn't here yet?

935
01:09:22,992 --> 01:09:27,053
But her number goes on in five minutes.
I'll be right there.

936
01:09:29,265 --> 01:09:32,393
- Good evening. A single, sir?
- Yes. I'd like to be pretty well down front.

937
01:09:32,501 --> 01:09:35,868
- I'm kind of hard of hearing.
- Yes, sir. This way, please.

938
01:09:37,907 --> 01:09:41,604
- Have you had any luck?
- No, sir, and I've tried calling every place I can think of.

939
01:09:41,710 --> 01:09:44,235
- Including the receiving hospital.
- This is all your fault.

940
01:09:44,346 --> 01:09:47,008
If you hadn't brought that marine backstage
last night, I wouldn't be in this jam.

941
01:09:47,116 --> 01:09:49,209
Listen, brother,
don't start throwing punches at me.

942
01:09:49,318 --> 01:09:52,446
You'd better figure out what you're
gonna tell that audience out there.

943
01:09:52,555 --> 01:09:56,423
Tommy Dooley is out front. Maybe he can
tell us where she is. Stay on that phone.

944
01:09:56,525 --> 01:10:01,087
- With the dinner, I want the best champagne in the house.
- Yes, sir.

945
01:10:01,197 --> 01:10:05,395
Excuse me, Mr. Dooley, but isn't this
a rather expensive way to get even?

946
01:10:05,501 --> 01:10:08,026
You think that's the only reason
I brought you here?

947
01:10:08,137 --> 01:10:10,537
I can't think of any other.
Can you?

948
01:10:10,639 --> 01:10:12,539
Well, let's not talk about it.

949
01:10:12,641 --> 01:10:16,475
Miss Lorraine goes on in two minutes, and
then you can see how little she means to me.

950
01:10:16,579 --> 01:10:19,480
I wouldn't be at all surprised
if she didn't go on tonight.

951
01:10:19,582 --> 01:10:21,914
- What makes you say that?
- By the tone of her letter.

952
01:10:22,017 --> 01:10:24,986
- She sounded awfully upset.
- Well, she should be.

953
01:10:25,087 --> 01:10:27,078
Pardon me, Tommy.

954
01:10:27,189 --> 01:10:29,157
Meet my secretary.
Miss Jones, Mr. Hall.

955
01:10:29,258 --> 01:10:31,283
How do you do?

956
01:10:33,362 --> 01:10:36,058
Good evening. Have you talked
to Miss Lorraine today?

957
01:10:36,165 --> 01:10:39,157
No. And what's more,
I don't care if I ever do.

958
01:10:39,268 --> 01:10:43,329
Oh, boy, am I in a spot. She's supposed to
go on right now, and she hasn't shown up.

959
01:10:43,439 --> 01:10:45,430
- Do you think anything's happened to her?
- I don't know.

960
01:10:45,541 --> 01:10:48,305
I've called every place in town,
including the receiving hospitals.

961
01:10:48,410 --> 01:10:52,471
- Have you tried the morgue?
- The morgue?

962
01:10:52,581 --> 01:10:54,913
- You don't think for a minute she could've-
- Now, wait. Don't get excited.

963
01:10:55,017 --> 01:10:57,212
People can be missing without being dead.

964
01:10:57,319 --> 01:10:59,719
Miss Jones, why didn't you make me
get in touch with her this morning?

965
01:10:59,822 --> 01:11:02,347
Well, don't just stand there.
Why don't you do something?

966
01:11:02,458 --> 01:11:05,154
<i>There's only one thing I can do: announce
to the crowd she won't appear tonight.</i>

967
01:11:05,261 --> 01:11:07,855
I'm not thinking about your show.
I'm worried about Miss Lorraine.

968
01:11:07,963 --> 01:11:11,558
- We've got to find her. - Don't jump on me.
If you hadn't walked out on her last night-

969
01:11:11,667 --> 01:11:14,101
- Pardon me, Mr. Hall. May I speak with you?
- Yeah. What is it?

970
01:11:14,203 --> 01:11:16,228
Miss McKay wants to know
if you want her to go on first.

971
01:11:16,338 --> 01:11:18,772
- Certainly. She'll have to. Tell her to get ready.
- Yes, sir.

972
01:11:18,974 --> 01:11:23,468
<i>- What do you mean,
if I hadn't walked out on her?</i>

973
01:11:28,050 --> 01:11:31,383
Listen, children
Listen to your teacher

974
01:11:31,487 --> 01:11:34,718
Pay attention and learn your ABC's

975
01:11:34,823 --> 01:11:39,487
<i>And when you grow up
you can be a quiz kid</i>

976
01:11:39,595 --> 01:11:42,496
Or a guest of honor

977
01:11:42,598 --> 01:11:45,829
<i>On Information Please</i>

978
01:11:49,138 --> 01:11:52,232
Listen, children
Listen to your teacher

979
01:11:52,341 --> 01:11:56,334
You gotta know your figures
if you wanna be considered bright

980
01:11:56,445 --> 01:11:59,608
Tell us more
oh, teacher

981
01:11:59,715 --> 01:12:03,276
Tell us more
more, more

982
01:12:03,385 --> 01:12:06,752
Listen, children
Listen to your teacher

983
01:12:06,855 --> 01:12:09,380
A boy plus a girl

984
01:12:09,491 --> 01:12:13,052
Plus a rendezvous

985
01:12:13,162 --> 01:12:15,892
Adds up to something
divided by two

986
01:12:15,998 --> 01:12:20,367
<i>Tell us more, oh, teacher
Tell us more</i>

987
01:12:20,469 --> 01:12:23,302
<i>Much more
Tell us more</i>

988
01:12:23,405 --> 01:12:25,305
Teacher

989
01:12:25,407 --> 01:12:29,901
If you wanna be teacher's pet

990
01:12:30,012 --> 01:12:32,708
Here's a little motto
that you mustn't

991
01:12:32,815 --> 01:12:36,444
No, you dasn't ever forget

992
01:12:36,552 --> 01:12:38,952
Don't carry tales out of school

993
01:12:39,054 --> 01:12:42,854
'Cause if you do
you're a fool

994
01:12:42,958 --> 01:12:45,449
<i>You mustn't tell
everything you know</i>

995
01:12:45,561 --> 01:12:49,122
And keep it to yourself
that I love you so much

996
01:12:49,231 --> 01:12:51,131
Don't

997
01:12:51,233 --> 01:12:54,691
Don't tell tall tales
Make it a rule

998
01:12:54,803 --> 01:12:58,933
And though a busybody may insist

999
01:12:59,041 --> 01:13:02,204
Don't let on that we've kissed

1000
01:13:02,311 --> 01:13:04,677
If you're a blabbermouth
you're off my list

1001
01:13:04,780 --> 01:13:08,580
So don't be a stubborn mule, baby

1002
01:13:08,684 --> 01:13:10,584
Don't carry tales

1003
01:13:10,686 --> 01:13:14,645
Tell us more, oh, teacher
Tell us more

1004
01:13:14,757 --> 01:13:20,286
There's nothing but ridicule for
a blabbermouth who breaks the rule

1005
01:13:20,396 --> 01:13:23,229
Don't carry tales

1006
01:13:23,332 --> 01:13:26,631
Out of school

1007
01:13:38,013 --> 01:13:42,211
- That girl's a blonde bomber.
- I don't know. I was engaged to her once.

1008
01:13:42,317 --> 01:13:45,343
What? You too?
What is this? An epidemic?

1009
01:13:45,454 --> 01:13:49,015
Just about.
She's engaged to 500 other guys.

1010
01:13:49,124 --> 01:13:51,092
Here comes one of them now.

1011
01:13:53,429 --> 01:13:57,661
Wait a minute.
How dare you disobey orders?

1012
01:13:57,766 --> 01:14:01,031
Didn't I tell you to stay away from her, and
didn't you tell me this morning you were through?

1013
01:14:01,136 --> 01:14:03,366
Yeah, but look, Chief.
I gotta find out what this is all about.

1014
01:14:03,472 --> 01:14:06,407
I'll tell you what it's all about.
She's out to trap you.

1015
01:14:06,508 --> 01:14:08,567
You're all wrong.
She's engaged to a marine.

1016
01:14:08,677 --> 01:14:11,942
She is not!
He just told me it was all off.

1017
01:14:12,047 --> 01:14:14,015
- Are you sure?
- Certainly I'm sure.

1018
01:14:14,116 --> 01:14:16,949
- I told you you don't know anything about women.
- Thanks.

1019
01:14:17,052 --> 01:14:20,647
- Wait a minute. Where you going?
- To take your advice, Chief, and learn about women.

1020
01:14:20,756 --> 01:14:24,453
Hello there. Long time no see.

1021
01:14:29,298 --> 01:14:31,630
- No, you don't, Tommy.
- Oh, now, Eddie.

1022
01:14:31,733 --> 01:14:35,328
- Not now. She's changing her costume for the next number.
- Be reasonable.

1023
01:15:24,720 --> 01:15:30,283
Did, did, did-d-d-d-did you hear

1024
01:15:30,392 --> 01:15:35,796
The story of the very merry widow

1025
01:15:35,898 --> 01:15:41,530
The merry widow
used to go for waltzes

1026
01:15:41,637 --> 01:15:47,200
And she danced a minuet
surprisingly swell

1027
01:15:47,309 --> 01:15:49,971
But she threw her waltzes away

1028
01:15:50,078 --> 01:15:52,672
Yep, the widow is hep today

1029
01:15:52,781 --> 01:15:58,447
Now the little lady
likes to do the rumba

1030
01:15:58,554 --> 01:16:01,318
And she really does it socko

1031
01:16:01,423 --> 01:16:04,187
At the Stork and El Morocco

1032
01:16:04,293 --> 01:16:09,788
Where they say she knows
her sambas very, very well

1033
01:16:09,898 --> 01:16:15,530
The merry widow
used to go for operas

1034
01:16:15,637 --> 01:16:21,098
In the royal box
she looked majestically swell

1035
01:16:21,209 --> 01:16:23,939
Now she gives her tickets away

1036
01:16:24,046 --> 01:16:26,571
And she's right in the groove today

1037
01:16:26,682 --> 01:16:32,279
For the little lady
likes a bit of boogie-woogie

1038
01:16:32,387 --> 01:16:37,654
<i>And she traded Traviata
for a trumpet's ra-ta-ta-ta</i>

1039
01:16:37,759 --> 01:16:40,785
And they say she digs her jivin'

1040
01:16:40,896 --> 01:16:43,956
Very, very well

1041
01:16:44,066 --> 01:16:46,864
When it was teatime
she used to stop in

1042
01:16:46,969 --> 01:16:49,733
For a cup of tea
with Mrs. Abercrombie

1043
01:16:49,838 --> 01:16:52,466
But now at teatime
she likes to drop in

1044
01:16:52,574 --> 01:16:56,772
For a double scotch and soda
or a Zombie

1045
01:16:56,878 --> 01:16:58,846
The merry widow

1046
01:16:58,947 --> 01:17:02,713
Wore the smartest dresses

1047
01:17:02,818 --> 01:17:08,586
In the sheerest black
she looked excitingly swell

1048
01:17:08,690 --> 01:17:11,420
But she packed her pretties away

1049
01:17:11,526 --> 01:17:14,120
Wears a uniform every day

1050
01:17:14,229 --> 01:17:19,861
Now the little lady
has no time for dancing

1051
01:17:19,968 --> 01:17:23,028
Does her job with great devotion

1052
01:17:23,138 --> 01:17:25,766
She's a cinch for big promotion

1053
01:17:25,874 --> 01:17:31,107
And they say she does her duties
very, very well

1054
01:17:31,213 --> 01:17:34,011
Very, very well

1055
01:17:34,116 --> 01:17:37,847
<i>Very, very well</i>

1056
01:17:44,393 --> 01:17:47,829
Now she hasn't any time for sambas

1057
01:17:50,032 --> 01:17:53,160
And she hasn't a minute
to spare for boogie-woogie

1058
01:17:56,138 --> 01:17:58,106
Hip-hip hooray
She's on her way

1059
01:17:58,206 --> 01:18:01,369
No time to play now

1060
01:18:01,476 --> 01:18:04,639
This merry little widow
is a busy little widow

1061
01:18:04,746 --> 01:18:11,242
