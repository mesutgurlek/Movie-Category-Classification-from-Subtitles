Hey, what did the blue jay say

3
00:01:58,351 --> 00:02:01,787
To the little sparrow
on the fence one day

4

always send for the professor...

you can get it back.

[Chuckles] Uh, yeah. Well,
I wouldn't go as far as to say that.

You've rendered me a valuable service,
sir. I can't thank you enough.

Oh, madam. I, uh, I was passing...

158
00:13:44,857 --> 00:13:48,384
in front of your, uh... cottage...

159
00:13:48,494 --> 00:13:50,985
when the culprit emerged
from the bushes.

160
00:13:51,096 --> 00:13:53,291
I seized him and grappled with him,

161
00:13:53,365 --> 00:13:56,664
but he was young and I am not
the Eustace Appleby that I was...

to victory.

If it wouldn't embarrass you, I'd like
you to accept a little something.

Oh, no, no, madam.
Thank you. Not for me.

Any American would have done the same.

- Eh, no.

How big a piece do you want?
A big piece or a real big piece?

that this apartment is not
big enough for both of us.

- I'll give you $800 for the watch.

608
00:42:11,595 --> 00:42:14,462
But I haven't got any more money.
You said it was mine for $700.

609
00:42:14,532 --> 00:42:17,660
- Oh, no. This gentleman gets it for $800.
- Thank you very much.

610
00:42:17,735 --> 00:42:20,568
I consider this a great favor.
[Chuckles]

611
00:42:20,638 --> 00:42:23,038
But look here, that's hardly fair.

612
00:42:23,107 --> 00:42:26,941
I came here with $700 to buy a watch,
and you give it to someone else.

613
00:42:28,345 --> 00:42:31,314
Here. Here's the watch.

614
00:42:31,415 --> 00:42:35,647
- Watch? What watch?
- Why, it's Napoleon's watch.

615
00:42:35,719 --> 00:42:37,914
You have the wrong man.
I'm not Napoleon.

616
00:42:37,988 --> 00:42:41,651
Uh, you're not... No.
But you said... You told me...

617
00:42:41,725 --> 00:42:45,923
- [Stammering]
- I never saw you before in my life, sir!

618
00:42:45,996 --> 00:42:48,430
You ne... Why, here... Uh...

619
00:42:48,499 --> 00:42:51,059
Uh! Oh, eh, eh, eh, eh...

620
00:42:57,541 --> 00:42:59,839
Don't you see that sign?

621
00:43:01,979 --> 00:43:04,948
- Well? Who's smoking?
- Huh...

622
00:43:11,722 --> 00:43:15,556
- Well, seeing you're a friend of mine...
- Yes?

623
00:43:15,626 --> 00:43:18,720
I'II, uh, give you a dollar
and a half for it.

624
00:43:18,796 --> 00:43:21,663
A dollar and a...
You don't understand.

625
00:43:21,732 --> 00:43:24,394
- This watch belonged to Napoleon.
- It did, eh?

626
00:43:24,468 --> 00:43:26,868
- Yes.
- Well, that makes it secondhand.

627
00:43:26,937 --> 00:43:28,871
Sec...

628
00:43:31,809 --> 00:43:37,076
Ah, Tom, my boy,
the whole world is empty as an eggshell.

629
00:43:37,181 --> 00:43:40,150
I know it, massah, I know it.

630
00:43:40,250 --> 00:43:43,447
- It seems to be given...
- Ah, there you are, Professor Appleby.

631
00:43:43,520 --> 00:43:48,082
- We've been waiting for you.
- Yes? Well, to what do I owe that honor?

632
00:43:48,158 --> 00:43:51,753
Well, we supplied you everything
for your play.

633
00:43:51,829 --> 00:43:53,763
We're the creditors, one might say,

634
00:43:53,831 --> 00:43:56,732
and Mr. Drew told us
you would give us our money.

635
00:43:56,800 --> 00:44:00,668
- Money? What money?
- The money Mr. Drew owes for scenery.

636
00:44:00,738 --> 00:44:03,263
- And the costumes and the...
- Oh, yes, that money.

637
00:44:03,340 --> 00:44:07,902
You're surely not suggesting that
Mr. Drew and I intend to defraud you.

638
00:44:09,246 --> 00:44:11,806
<i>Mr. Drew, you told us</i>
<i>that he would pay us our money.</i>

639
00:44:11,915 --> 00:44:14,509
Yes, of course.
Pay them, Professor.

640
00:44:14,618 --> 00:44:17,416
Well, I, uh...
I don't like their attitude, Allen.

641
00:44:17,488 --> 00:44:20,457
I never heard of people
doing business this way.

642
00:44:20,557 --> 00:44:24,118
- Why argue? Pay them and get it over.
- Uhh...

643
00:44:24,194 --> 00:44:27,925
Yes, well, the truth is,
I flnd myself a little short.

644
00:44:27,998 --> 00:44:29,932
Short? How much?

645
00:44:30,000 --> 00:44:33,902
Well, it's around $800.

646
00:44:33,971 --> 00:44:37,668
That's all the money I gave you.

647
00:44:37,741 --> 00:44:42,440
- It wasn't my fault. I was cheated.
- That's all the money I had!

648
00:44:42,513 --> 00:44:45,914
<i>I was stupid enough to trust a scoundrel</i>
<i>like you. You blundering old fool!</i>

649
00:44:45,983 --> 00:44:49,544
The professor said that you'd pay us.
Now, what about it?

650
00:44:49,653 --> 00:44:51,814
I'm sorry, but you heard what he said.

651
00:44:51,889 --> 00:44:55,825
You're going to pay me.
Nobody's going to put anything over
on Emery T. Hawkins.

652
00:44:55,893 --> 00:44:58,487
And you're not through
with me either.

653
00:44:58,562 --> 00:45:00,826
That's what I get for giving credit
to a bluffing upstart.

654
00:45:00,898 --> 00:45:04,629
- Let's haul this stuff out.
- I'm gonna send a wagon for my stuff.

655
00:45:04,702 --> 00:45:06,636
[Chattering]

656
00:45:11,175 --> 00:45:13,700
<i>Take it out and put it on the truck.</i>

657
00:45:13,777 --> 00:45:16,610
Well, I guess that ends everything.

658
00:45:18,749 --> 00:45:22,913
I didn't mean to do it, Dimples.

659
00:45:23,020 --> 00:45:26,285
- Do you see?
- You broke your promise to me.

660
00:45:26,356 --> 00:45:29,189
But the man swore to me.
He gave me his word.

661
00:45:29,259 --> 00:45:31,750
You told me you
wouldn't steal anymore.

662
00:45:31,829 --> 00:45:34,855
But what I really meant...
I mean, l-l-l...

663
00:45:34,932 --> 00:45:37,867
I didn't buy the watch
for myself. L-l...

664
00:45:37,935 --> 00:45:40,631
You said you were
going to be honest.

665
00:45:41,805 --> 00:45:46,640
Uhh. Well, I guess I'm not much good.

666
00:45:46,710 --> 00:45:49,008
Maybe you'd be better off without me.

667
00:45:49,079 --> 00:45:51,513
- But I thought you had money, Allen.
- I did have...

668
00:45:51,615 --> 00:45:53,549
enough, anyway.

669
00:45:53,617 --> 00:45:55,778
I guess I didn't
take care of it very well.

670
00:45:55,886 --> 00:45:58,855
Well, uh, what are you
going to do now?

671
00:45:58,922 --> 00:46:01,356
I suppose I can get a job somewhere...

672
00:46:01,425 --> 00:46:04,394
and maybe save up
enough money to do the show.

673
00:46:04,461 --> 00:46:06,929
That needn't change
our plans about marriage any, Cleo.

674
00:46:09,199 --> 00:46:12,532
I don't suppose money is very important
to people who are really in love.

675
00:46:12,603 --> 00:46:14,594
You can say that
because you've always had money.

676
00:46:14,671 --> 00:46:18,573
- Perhaps.
- I'm afraid this changes everything.

677
00:46:18,642 --> 00:46:21,805
Then you're not really
in love with me.

678
00:46:21,879 --> 00:46:24,575
Oh, you mustn't say that, darling.

679
00:46:24,681 --> 00:46:27,149
I'll run along. Good-bye, Allen.

680
00:46:27,217 --> 00:46:30,675
<i>[Allen]</i>
<i>Good-bye.</i>

681
00:46:32,389 --> 00:46:34,653
I'm awfully sorry, Allen.

682
00:46:34,725 --> 00:46:37,489
Look here, Drew.
It's all right for the rest.

683
00:46:37,561 --> 00:46:39,495
They can take their things back
and sell them.

684
00:46:39,563 --> 00:46:42,123
These costumes have been made
to fit your play.

685
00:46:42,199 --> 00:46:44,133
They're not worth a penny
to anybody else.

686
00:46:44,201 --> 00:46:46,669
How am I going to get
my money out of them?

687
00:46:46,737 --> 00:46:50,605
- Sorry, but there's nothing I can do.
- We'll see about that!

688
00:46:50,674 --> 00:46:53,575
Somebody's going to jail for this!

689
00:47:02,219 --> 00:47:04,153
Mrs. Drew,

690
00:47:04,221 --> 00:47:07,952
do you still think I'm worth $5,000?

691
00:47:08,025 --> 00:47:10,516
You're worth ever so much more, darling.

692
00:47:12,329 --> 00:47:14,820
And do you still want me
to come and live with you?

693
00:47:14,898 --> 00:47:17,366
I can't think of
anything I'd like more.

694
00:47:17,434 --> 00:47:20,130
All right, I'll come.

695
00:47:20,204 --> 00:47:22,468
Have you got the $5,000 with you?

696
00:47:22,539 --> 00:47:24,473
[Laughing]

697
00:47:32,216 --> 00:47:35,413
I'll be right out!
It won't take me more than a minute.

698
00:47:42,326 --> 00:47:45,056
So you're really going.

699
00:47:45,128 --> 00:47:47,358
Yes, Professor.

700
00:47:47,431 --> 00:47:51,162
Well, I knew it was
the best thing for you,

701
00:47:51,235 --> 00:47:55,604
but l-I didn't think
you'd want to go.

702
00:47:55,672 --> 00:47:58,573
Well, it's like Mrs. Drew said,

703
00:47:58,642 --> 00:48:02,601
"A little girl shouldn't be raised
in this kind of'envinoment."'

704
00:48:02,679 --> 00:48:05,773
Yes, you'II... be much better off...

705
00:48:05,883 --> 00:48:09,410
in that nice, big house.

706
00:48:09,519 --> 00:48:14,149
Of course, it'll be Ionely.
There'll be no children to play with.

707
00:48:14,224 --> 00:48:19,491
But I gotta think of the future,
Professor. That's what Mrs. Drew says.

708
00:48:19,563 --> 00:48:22,396
Yes, and she's right.

709
00:48:22,466 --> 00:48:27,460
And she'll see that you get
the right kind of food too.

710
00:48:27,537 --> 00:48:32,440
Plenty of carrots...
maybe three or four times a day.

711
00:48:34,845 --> 00:48:39,407
Of course, you won't be able
to go fishing with me anymore.

712
00:48:40,918 --> 00:48:44,183
<i>But I guess it</i>'<i>s the best thing.</i>

713
00:48:44,254 --> 00:48:48,748
<i>Fishing isn</i>'<i>t any too good</i>
<i>for little girls.</i>

714
00:48:48,825 --> 00:48:50,759
I like fishing fine.

715
00:48:53,864 --> 00:48:56,492
But I guess it isn't good
for little girls.

716
00:48:58,001 --> 00:49:02,335
No, l... I guess it isn't.

717
00:49:03,407 --> 00:49:05,602
- <i>[Knocking]</i>
- Come in.

718
00:49:05,676 --> 00:49:10,045
- Well, I think I'll be going.
- A note from Miss Drew, sir.

719
00:49:10,113 --> 00:49:12,775
- Are you ready, miss?
- I'm ready.

720
00:49:18,055 --> 00:49:21,582
- Ahh...
- Good-bye, Professor.

721
00:49:21,658 --> 00:49:23,592
Good-bye, my little angel.

722
00:49:25,595 --> 00:49:29,031
You'll come and see me sometimes,
won't you?

723
00:49:29,099 --> 00:49:31,624
Of course I will.

724
00:49:31,702 --> 00:49:36,799
And you're gonna take good care
of yourself like you said you would?

725
00:49:36,873 --> 00:49:39,068
I will.

726
00:49:39,142 --> 00:49:43,408
And you'II... be good too?

727
00:49:43,480 --> 00:49:45,414
Uh, yeah.

728
00:50:16,279 --> 00:50:18,179
<i>[Knocking]</i>

729
00:50:22,986 --> 00:50:27,116
Mr. Professor, there's a man without
a policeman, Mr. Hawkins, to see you.

730
00:50:27,224 --> 00:50:29,749
- I'm not here. Tell him I'm not here.
- Yes, sir.

731
00:50:29,860 --> 00:50:33,057
- Mr. Hawkins, he's gone...
- Not here, eh?

732
00:50:33,130 --> 00:50:36,258
Listen, Appleby, I've come here
to give you one more chance...

733
00:50:36,333 --> 00:50:38,267
to pay for those costumes.

734
00:50:38,335 --> 00:50:41,065
If you don't,
I'll have you in jail in an hour.

735
00:50:42,839 --> 00:50:45,239
L...

736
00:50:45,308 --> 00:50:47,572
You'll have your money tonight.

737
00:50:47,644 --> 00:50:51,637
I might've known you'd try that.
I should've sent the law.

738
00:50:51,715 --> 00:50:54,411
I made a mistake coming here myself.

739
00:50:54,518 --> 00:50:58,215
You certainly did,
Mr. Hawkins, and if you don't get out,

740
00:50:58,321 --> 00:51:03,281
I'll be tempted to pull off one of your
arms and beat your head in with it!

741
00:51:04,661 --> 00:51:07,289
Professor, I didn't know
he was gonna start nothin'!

742
00:51:49,706 --> 00:51:52,470
The professor used to dance
and sing for me after dinner.

743
00:51:52,542 --> 00:51:55,136
But, of course,
the dinners weren't good for me.

744
00:51:57,514 --> 00:52:00,608
Last night we had wieners...
four a piece!

745
00:52:04,988 --> 00:52:07,047
Can you do birdcalls?

[Clears Throat]

748
00:52:53,170 --> 00:52:56,298
Professor Appleby to see you, Mrs. Drew.

749
00:52:56,373 --> 00:52:59,900
- Oh, yes. Come right in, Professor.
- <i>Oh, ho.</i>

750
00:52:59,976 --> 00:53:03,878
- I see you got my note.
- Yes, thank you.

751
00:53:03,947 --> 00:53:08,941
I, uh... I guess it's better
for everyone concerned.

752
00:53:09,052 --> 00:53:13,682
Dimples will be happy,
and my debts will be paid.

753
00:53:13,790 --> 00:53:15,849
And as for me, l...

754
00:53:15,959 --> 00:53:19,656
I guess I ought to be glad to know
that Dimples has such a fine home.

755
00:53:19,729 --> 00:53:22,197
You won't be sorry for this, Professor.

756
00:53:22,265 --> 00:53:27,396
I wonder if I might see Dimples
for a minute, just to say good-bye.

757
00:53:27,470 --> 00:53:32,134
Oh, yes, of course. Rufus,
take Professor Appleby to Dimples' room.

758
00:53:32,209 --> 00:53:34,302
- Yes, ma'am.
- Ah, thank you.

759
00:53:51,361 --> 00:53:53,295
Why, my darling.

760
00:53:54,731 --> 00:53:56,665
Oh, Professor!

761
00:53:56,733 --> 00:54:01,864
Oh! Why, what's wrong with
my little girl? Aren't you happy here?

762
00:54:01,938 --> 00:54:06,068
Oh, yes, yes, I'm very happy.

763
00:54:06,142 --> 00:54:08,235
I hurt my finger.

764
00:54:08,311 --> 00:54:10,279
Where? Are you sure?

765
00:54:11,348 --> 00:54:13,282
Of course.

766
00:54:15,552 --> 00:54:19,113
There. That's better, isn't it?
[Chuckles]

767
00:54:19,222 --> 00:54:21,281
There we are.

768
00:54:21,391 --> 00:54:24,360
And you can see
this lovely dress Mrs. Drew got me.

769
00:54:24,427 --> 00:54:29,729
Yes, it's beautiful.
Must've cost a lot of money, huh?

770
00:54:29,799 --> 00:54:33,599
And she's gonna buy me
some dolls too... three of them.

771
00:54:33,670 --> 00:54:36,730
Ah, you're a very lucky little girl,

772
00:54:36,806 --> 00:54:40,401
and I'm happy to know that
you've got such a nice home.

773
00:54:40,477 --> 00:54:45,813
It isn't every little girl who can have
such a good "envinoment." [Crying]

774
00:54:45,882 --> 00:54:49,113
Oh, my darling.
I'm gonna take you home.

775
00:54:50,820 --> 00:54:55,723
No, Professor. Mrs. Drew says I'm gonna
have a lot of advantages here.

776
00:54:55,792 --> 00:55:00,593
Yes, but no place is nice for
my little girl when it makes her cry.

777
00:55:00,664 --> 00:55:02,598
You're going home with me.

778
00:55:02,666 --> 00:55:05,157
But if I stay here,
you won't have to go to jail.

779
00:55:05,235 --> 00:55:07,465
You can give Allen back his money.

780
00:55:07,537 --> 00:55:11,303
[Chuckles]
I won't go to jail, sweet.

781
00:55:17,981 --> 00:55:20,916
Mrs. Drew, l... I'm terribly sorry.

782
00:55:21,017 --> 00:55:25,454
It was in a moment of great weakness
that I took this money.

783
00:55:25,522 --> 00:55:27,922
- Oh...
- When I saw my little girl crying,

784
00:55:27,991 --> 00:55:32,485
I realized there wasn't enough money
in the world to compensate me for that.

785
00:55:32,562 --> 00:55:36,225
You saw her crying? I don't understand.
Don't you like it here?

786
00:55:36,299 --> 00:55:39,826
I do, but I get so Ionesome
without the professor.

787
00:55:39,903 --> 00:55:44,431
[Chuckles] I was willing to give her
up, knowing all you could do for her,

788
00:55:44,507 --> 00:55:46,873
but I see now that...

789
00:55:46,943 --> 00:55:49,707
Dimples needs me
as much as I need her.

790
00:55:49,779 --> 00:55:52,577
Oh! I guess I was
foolish to imagine...

791
00:55:52,649 --> 00:55:55,709
the child could ever become
as fond of me as she is of you.

792
00:55:55,819 --> 00:56:00,188
I admire your honesty and respect you
for declining the money.

793
00:56:00,256 --> 00:56:03,953
- Oh, thank you, Mrs. Drew.
- And I thank you too.

794
00:56:04,027 --> 00:56:08,157
You know, I wouldn't go away
if the professor could live here too.

795
00:56:10,867 --> 00:56:13,802
Mrs. Drew,
why don't you marry the professor?

796
00:56:13,870 --> 00:56:16,168
[Laughing]
Why, my dear child...

797
00:56:16,239 --> 00:56:20,608
Then your house wouldn't be so Ionesome.
Professor's lots of fun.

798
00:56:20,677 --> 00:56:24,943
- [Coughing]
- I'd marry him if I was grown up.

799
00:56:25,014 --> 00:56:28,541
Course, he hasn't much money,
but you've got a lot. [Giggles]

800
00:56:29,886 --> 00:56:32,081
Yes, well, I, uh,

801
00:56:32,188 --> 00:56:35,624
think perhaps you'd better
run along, darling, and get your things.

802
00:56:35,725 --> 00:56:40,253
- I'll be with you in a minute.
- Good-bye, Mrs. Drew.

803
00:56:40,330 --> 00:56:43,060
Maybe you can come
and see us some day.

804
00:56:44,367 --> 00:56:46,835
At our house,
you won't have to eat any carrots!

805
00:56:46,903 --> 00:56:49,064
Oh!

806
00:56:49,139 --> 00:56:51,937
Heh, heh!
Well, good-bye, Mrs. Drew,

807
00:56:52,008 --> 00:56:54,704
and thank you for all your kindness.

808
00:57:02,352 --> 00:57:04,479
Of course, you realize, Mrs. Drew,

809
00:57:04,587 --> 00:57:08,353
I was only doing this
to save our poor little home.

810
00:57:08,425 --> 00:57:11,155
Why, yes, of course.

811
00:57:11,227 --> 00:57:14,822
But thanks to a kindly providence,
I still have means of getting the money.

812
00:57:14,898 --> 00:57:18,925
Of course, it will mean that I'll have
to sell my one remaining heirloom,

813
00:57:19,002 --> 00:57:23,405
something that's been in the family
for generations, but I'll do it.

814
00:57:23,473 --> 00:57:25,407
Oh, that's too bad.

815
00:57:25,475 --> 00:57:28,911
I wouldn't mind so much if I didn't have
to sell it at such a great sacrifice.

816
00:57:28,978 --> 00:57:31,947
But it seems a pity that these
money-grubbing jewelers...

817
00:57:32,015 --> 00:57:33,949
should get the watch for $1,000...

818
00:57:34,017 --> 00:57:36,383
when it's easily worth
five times that much.

819
00:57:36,486 --> 00:57:39,978
- The watch?
- Yes, yes. Napoleon's watch.

820
00:57:40,089 --> 00:57:42,353
- Oh!
- Eh, Josephine gave it to him,

821
00:57:42,425 --> 00:57:45,690
and he gave it to
my grandfather at Elba.

822
00:57:45,762 --> 00:57:48,322
Hmm, poor, dear Grandfather.

823
00:57:48,398 --> 00:57:51,492
If he'd ever guessed that I'd
have to sell Napoleon's watch...

824
00:57:51,568 --> 00:57:53,502
to a money-grubbing jeweler...

825
00:57:53,570 --> 00:57:57,028
- Is that it?
- Yes. Isn't it a beautiful thing?

826
00:57:57,106 --> 00:57:59,904
- Is there anything I could do?
- Oh, no, no, Mrs. Drew.

827
00:57:59,976 --> 00:58:02,604
I couldn't take money from you.

828
00:58:02,679 --> 00:58:06,308
But, uh, perhaps...
perhaps you'd let me give it to you.

829
00:58:06,382 --> 00:58:08,646
- Why...
- I'd like you to have it.

830
00:58:08,751 --> 00:58:10,820
You're very kind,
but I couldn't take it.

831
00:58:10,954 --> 00:58:15,982
Of course, you could give me the small
pittance that the jewelers offered,

832
00:58:16,092 --> 00:58:20,586
and someday when fortune smiles on me
again I'll buy it back from you.

833
00:58:20,697 --> 00:58:23,131
For Dame Fortune is a fickle gypsy,

834
00:58:23,199 --> 00:58:26,327
always blind and often tipsy.
[Chuckles]

835
00:58:26,402 --> 00:58:29,929
- A thousand dollars?
- Yes, dear lady.

836
00:58:30,006 --> 00:58:32,497
- Oh.
- You'll take care of it, won't you?

837
00:58:32,575 --> 00:58:37,911
- Yes.
- Now I know just how Napoleon felt...

838
00:58:37,981 --> 00:58:42,350
when he had to give up
this beautiful trinket.

839
00:58:42,418 --> 00:58:45,717
Oh, thank you.
Good night, Mrs. Drew.

840
00:58:45,788 --> 00:58:48,586
Good night.

841
00:58:48,691 --> 00:58:51,421
- What a lovely hand.
- Why, Professor.

842
00:58:51,528 --> 00:58:55,294
- Oh ho! Pardon me. I forgot myself.
- Oh!

843
00:58:55,365 --> 00:58:58,266
- I didn't realize my position.
- [Laughs]

844
00:58:58,334 --> 00:59:01,701
But after all, Mrs. Drew,
I'm only human,

845
00:59:01,771 --> 00:59:04,035
and your charms are irresistible.

846
00:59:04,107 --> 00:59:06,041
[Both Laugh]

847
00:59:06,109 --> 00:59:08,577
Good night. Good night.

848
00:59:23,226 --> 00:59:25,421
[Crowd Chatter]

849
00:59:25,528 --> 00:59:27,860
Uh, 35 cents for one ticket?

850
00:59:27,931 --> 00:59:30,695
Well, opening night prices
are a little high,

851
00:59:30,767 --> 00:59:32,701
but those are
the best seats in the house.

852
00:59:35,405 --> 00:59:40,035
[Clears Throat]
Well, Allen's play opens tonight.

853
00:59:40,109 --> 00:59:42,907
I'm afraid Betty
is still fond of Allen.

854
00:59:42,979 --> 00:59:45,709
- I've forbidden her to see him.
- Have you?

855
00:59:45,782 --> 00:59:48,080
Yes, the theater's ruined
that young man.

856
00:59:48,151 --> 00:59:52,520
- Can't we speak of something else?
- Hmm? Yes, of course.

857
00:59:52,589 --> 00:59:54,523
[Chuckles]

858
00:59:54,624 --> 00:59:58,526
Oh, by the way,
I thought you might be interested...

859
00:59:58,595 --> 01:00:02,531
in an old emerald ring
that I picked up at auction.

860
01:00:02,632 --> 01:00:07,069
Five hundred years old. One of
the finest things in my collection.

861
01:00:07,136 --> 01:00:11,903
Mmm. I know so little
about these things.

862
01:00:11,975 --> 01:00:13,909
By the way...

863
01:00:13,977 --> 01:00:17,310
I have something I think
might interest you...

864
01:00:17,380 --> 01:00:20,178
the watch Josephine gave Napoleon.

865
01:00:20,249 --> 01:00:25,016
- Oh!
- Professor Appleby had it
in his family for many years.

866
01:00:25,088 --> 01:00:27,022
Oh.

867
01:00:29,592 --> 01:00:31,526
Mm-hmm.

868
01:00:34,330 --> 01:00:36,264
Mm.

869
01:00:36,332 --> 01:00:38,926
Well,
if that watch belonged to Napoleon,

870
01:00:39,002 --> 01:00:40,867
it was given to him
20 years after he died.

871
01:00:40,937 --> 01:00:45,931
- What?
- This thing is tin. An obvious fake.

872
01:00:46,009 --> 01:00:49,740
But I gave the professor
a thousand dollars for it.

873
01:00:49,812 --> 01:00:52,337
Then you were robbed.
The watch is worthless.

874
01:00:55,518 --> 01:00:58,112
And after I helped him.

875
01:00:58,187 --> 01:01:02,283
I kept him out of jail. I trusted him.

876
01:01:02,392 --> 01:01:06,351
I believed all the kind things he said.

877
01:01:06,462 --> 01:01:09,329
- <i>The man has made a fool of you.</i>
- He hasn't yet!

878
01:01:09,399 --> 01:01:13,335
I'm going to show him that
I can be just as merciless as he can!

879
01:01:13,403 --> 01:01:17,703
Get your hat, Jasper.
We're going to the police station!

880
01:01:19,776 --> 01:01:22,802
- Can you see her?
- Who, darlin'?

881
01:01:22,879 --> 01:01:25,973
Oh, don't pretend.
I know you're looking for Betty.

882
01:01:26,049 --> 01:01:29,314
I don't see her.
I don't suppose she'll be here.

883
01:01:37,326 --> 01:01:40,090
I'm just a doorman, miss,
and orders is orders.

884
01:01:40,163 --> 01:01:42,529
That's all right, Spike.
We're expecting her.

885
01:01:42,598 --> 01:01:46,500
- You're expecting me?
- As if you didn't know! [Giggles]

886
01:01:56,746 --> 01:02:01,479
- Did you flnd her yet?
- No. I didn't think she'd come.

887
01:02:03,653 --> 01:02:05,587
Betty.

888
01:02:05,655 --> 01:02:09,182
I think I'd better go
and rehearse my lines.

889
01:02:09,292 --> 01:02:12,989
- This is the nicest surprise I've had.
- I came to wish you good luck.

890
01:02:13,096 --> 01:02:15,155
This is good luck, Betty.

891
01:02:15,264 --> 01:02:18,131
I didn't think you'd ever look at me
again after the fool I made of myself.

892
01:02:18,201 --> 01:02:22,001
I'm willing to forget all that, Allen.
But Father never will.

893
01:02:22,071 --> 01:02:24,164
If he knew I'd come here,
he'd be in a rage.

894
01:02:24,240 --> 01:02:26,174
<i>[Man]</i>
<i>Ten minutes!</i>

895
01:02:26,242 --> 01:02:29,177
- Come with me, and I'll get you a seat.
- <i>Ten minutes!</i>

896
01:02:32,081 --> 01:02:34,015
<i>[Applause]</i>

897
01:02:34,083 --> 01:02:36,017
<i>[Orchestra]</i>

898
01:02:37,253 --> 01:02:39,687
<i>[Continues]</i>

899
01:02:59,876 --> 01:03:02,310
<i>[Laughter]</i>

900
01:03:08,284 --> 01:03:12,914
Oh, Topsy, Topsy.
You've been very bad again.

901
01:03:12,989 --> 01:03:16,049
- We want to see Professor Appleby.
- You'll have to wait here.

902
01:03:16,159 --> 01:03:18,821
