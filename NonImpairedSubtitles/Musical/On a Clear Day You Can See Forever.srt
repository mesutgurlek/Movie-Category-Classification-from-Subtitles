1
00:00:16,391 --> 00:00:19,557
Hey, buds below

2
00:00:21,604 --> 00:00:25,056
Up is where to grow

3
00:00:27,068 --> 00:00:32,442
Up, with which below
Can't compare with

4
00:00:32,615 --> 00:00:34,406
Hurry

5
00:00:34,742 --> 00:00:39,155
It's lovely up here

6
00:00:42,207 --> 00:00:46,502
Life down a hole
Takes an awful toll

7
00:00:46,712 --> 00:00:51,041
What with not a soul there
To share with

8
00:00:51,759 --> 00:00:56,753
Hurry, it's lovely up here

9
00:01:00,267 --> 00:01:02,390
Wake up

10
00:01:02,561 --> 00:01:08,894
Bestir yourself
It's time that you disinter yourself

11
00:01:09,985 --> 00:01:16,522
You've got a spot to fill
A pot to fill

12
00:01:16,699 --> 00:01:20,531
And what a gift package

13
00:01:20,703 --> 00:01:23,028
Of shower, sun and love

14
00:01:23,206 --> 00:01:26,955
You'll be met above everywhere

15
00:01:27,127 --> 00:01:30,661
With fondled and sniffed

16
00:01:31,297 --> 00:01:35,959
By millions who drift by

17
00:01:36,761 --> 00:01:41,969
Life here is rosy

18
00:01:42,141 --> 00:01:46,186
If you're a posy

19
00:01:46,353 --> 00:01:53,020
Hurry, it's lovely here

20
00:01:57,198 --> 00:02:01,242
Climb up, geranium

21
00:02:01,410 --> 00:02:05,905
It can't be fun subterranean

22
00:02:06,122 --> 00:02:09,574
On the exterior

23
00:02:09,750 --> 00:02:13,796
It's cheerier

24
00:02:13,964 --> 00:02:17,664
R.S. V.P., peonies

25
00:02:17,843 --> 00:02:19,503
Pollinate the breeze

26
00:02:19,678 --> 00:02:24,838
Make the queen of bees
Hot as brandy

27
00:02:25,015 --> 00:02:33,356
Come give at least
A preview of Easter

28
00:02:33,525 --> 00:02:37,937
Come up
And see the hoot we're giving

29
00:02:38,112 --> 00:02:42,989
Come up
And see the grounds for living

30
00:02:43,159 --> 00:02:46,943
Come poke your head out

31
00:02:47,122 --> 00:02:51,866
Open up and spread out

32
00:02:52,043 --> 00:03:01,047
Hurry, it's lovely here

33
00:03:29,204 --> 00:03:32,038
On a clear day

34
00:03:32,207 --> 00:03:35,872
You can see forever

35
00:03:36,044 --> 00:03:40,955
Forever and ever and ever and ever

36
00:03:42,885 --> 00:03:49,598
And you'll see who you are

37
00:03:50,767 --> 00:03:54,515
On a clear day

38
00:03:54,812 --> 00:03:58,477
How it will astound you

39
00:03:58,816 --> 00:04:03,063
That the glow of your being

40
00:04:03,279 --> 00:04:06,731
Outshines every star

41
00:04:06,907 --> 00:04:10,608
You'll feel part of

42
00:04:10,787 --> 00:04:14,784
Every mountain, sea and shore

43
00:04:14,958 --> 00:04:18,326
You can hear from far and near

44
00:04:18,502 --> 00:04:21,623
A world you never

45
00:04:21,797 --> 00:04:27,503
Never heard before

46
00:04:27,676 --> 00:04:33,965
And on a clear day

47
00:04:34,143 --> 00:04:38,057
On a clear day

48
00:04:38,230 --> 00:04:44,648
You can see forever and ever

49
00:04:44,820 --> 00:04:46,730
And ever

50
00:04:46,904 --> 00:04:53,738
And evermore

51
00:05:30,615 --> 00:05:34,908
And now the window opens.
It gently, gently opens,

52
00:05:35,076 --> 00:05:38,243
and the night steals softly in.

53
00:05:38,414 --> 00:05:41,200
Your eyelids now are heavy.

54
00:05:41,374 --> 00:05:44,374
Your arms are numb and heavy.

55
00:05:44,543 --> 00:05:47,795
Your legs are dull and heavy

56
00:05:47,965 --> 00:05:50,751
and you give yourself to sleep.

57
00:05:50,926 --> 00:05:53,880
A deep sleep.

58
00:06:02,521 --> 00:06:04,228
He's under. Lights, please.

59
00:06:05,857 --> 00:06:08,395
I'll begin with
posthypnotic suggestion,

60
00:06:08,568 --> 00:06:12,103
and after, if Preston here
is a good subject, regression.

61
00:06:12,280 --> 00:06:14,652
- When does this class meet again?
- On Wednesday, sir.

62
00:06:14,824 --> 00:06:16,817
On Wednesday.

63
00:06:17,369 --> 00:06:22,113
Mr Preston, after I waken you,
the first time I say the word

64
00:06:22,290 --> 00:06:25,955
"Wednesday," you will take off your left
shoe and sock and put them on again.

65
00:06:26,461 --> 00:06:30,539
Remember, the first time
I say the word "Wednesday."

66
00:06:30,714 --> 00:06:32,375
Now for regression.

67
00:06:32,550 --> 00:06:36,168
I will try and take Preston back
through his life to the age of 5.

68
00:06:36,345 --> 00:06:38,967
Stand up and turn around, please.

69
00:06:41,933 --> 00:06:45,268
I want you to go back in time
to your 20th birthday.

70
00:06:45,437 --> 00:06:48,308
- Dr Chabot.
- No questions now.

71
00:06:48,483 --> 00:06:52,811
Now, five years more
to your 15th birthday.

72
00:06:54,196 --> 00:06:57,529
Now, five years more
to your 10th.

73
00:06:57,699 --> 00:07:01,033
Now, another five years, and when I
count to three and snap my fingers,

74
00:07:01,200 --> 00:07:03,492
you will be 5 years old.

75
00:07:03,663 --> 00:07:08,409
Five years old,
at your first day of school.

76
00:07:09,210 --> 00:07:10,789
One,

77
00:07:11,130 --> 00:07:13,169
two...

78
00:07:13,339 --> 00:07:16,258
Give me back my chalk, Henry.
Come on, Henry Tillsbury.

79
00:07:16,425 --> 00:07:18,799
You give me back my chalk,
or I'll throw the glue at you

80
00:07:18,970 --> 00:07:20,298
and you'll get all gooey.

81
00:07:20,472 --> 00:07:23,556
- Sit down, Preston.
- Oh, Henry, I am not sitting

82
00:07:23,725 --> 00:07:25,468
- on your turtle. Honest.
- What's her name?

83
00:07:25,644 --> 00:07:29,308
- Miss Hildebrand, you gotta make...
- Doesn't anybody know who she is?

84
00:07:29,481 --> 00:07:31,188
Sleep.

85
00:07:32,567 --> 00:07:34,809
To be hypnotized indirectly
is very common,

86
00:07:34,986 --> 00:07:38,152
but to be regressed indirectly
is not only unusual

87
00:07:38,322 --> 00:07:40,114
but a little nerve-wracking.

88
00:07:40,742 --> 00:07:43,314
Listen to me.
You are no longer 5 years old.

89
00:07:43,494 --> 00:07:44,905
You are as you are today.

90
00:07:45,079 --> 00:07:46,905
And when I count to three
and snap my fingers,

91
00:07:47,080 --> 00:07:48,990
you will awaken feeling fine.

92
00:07:49,167 --> 00:07:52,582
One, two, three.

93
00:07:52,920 --> 00:07:54,829
How do you feel?

94
00:07:55,506 --> 00:07:57,084
Fine.

95
00:08:00,677 --> 00:08:02,550
What happened?
I mean, how did I get over here?

96
00:08:02,720 --> 00:08:05,259
You were hypnotized by mistake.

97
00:08:06,142 --> 00:08:10,009
- Your mistake or mine?
- I suppose it was a bit of both.

98
00:08:10,187 --> 00:08:12,939
I opened the window,
but you fell out.

99
00:08:15,066 --> 00:08:18,232
- What's your name?
- Daisy Gamble.

100
00:08:18,862 --> 00:08:20,902
You're not a medical student,
are you?

101
00:08:22,114 --> 00:08:23,858
No.

102
00:08:24,075 --> 00:08:26,483
Did everybody, I mean,
you know, fall out?

103
00:08:26,662 --> 00:08:27,990
No. No, just you.

104
00:08:29,206 --> 00:08:31,079
Just me?

105
00:08:32,166 --> 00:08:34,206
I'm awfully sorry, doctor.

106
00:08:34,378 --> 00:08:37,876
I didn't mean to butt in, I...
Oh, I'm awfully sorry, everybody.

107
00:08:38,047 --> 00:08:42,626
I mean, I didn't mean to butt in.
Please, go on with your act.

108
00:08:42,803 --> 00:08:44,344
It won't happen to me again.

109
00:08:44,513 --> 00:08:47,513
Boy, you can swing open
that window all you want,

110
00:08:47,682 --> 00:08:50,387
and when the night starts crawling in,
my eyelids won't get heavy

111
00:08:50,560 --> 00:08:57,013
and my arms get numb and heavy
and my legs get dull and heavy and...

112
00:08:57,191 --> 00:08:59,682
When I count to three
and press your forehead,

113
00:08:59,861 --> 00:09:02,102
you will awaken and stay awake.

114
00:09:02,697 --> 00:09:06,232
- One, two, three.
- Oh, God.

115
00:09:06,409 --> 00:09:08,567
Why don't you step outside
and get a little air.

116
00:09:08,744 --> 00:09:12,611
Sure. I mean, sure.
Have you got a cigarette, please?

117
00:09:12,956 --> 00:09:16,788
I'm awfully sorry, doctor. Really.
Do you have a match?

118
00:09:17,377 --> 00:09:18,753
Oh, thank you very...

119
00:09:18,920 --> 00:09:23,083
Doctor, I'm awfully sorry,
kids, really.

120
00:09:25,761 --> 00:09:27,634
Push.

121
00:09:31,266 --> 00:09:32,926
Sorry.

122
00:09:34,894 --> 00:09:38,393
Preston, you are no longer
5, 10, 15 or 20.

123
00:09:38,565 --> 00:09:40,059
You are as you are now.

124
00:09:40,233 --> 00:09:43,317
And when I count to three and snap
my fingers, you will awaken.

125
00:09:43,487 --> 00:09:47,069
One, two, three.

126
00:09:48,950 --> 00:09:50,943
Do you feel all right?

127
00:09:51,119 --> 00:09:53,444
- Yes, sir.
- What is it?

128
00:09:53,662 --> 00:09:56,664
Sir, nothing happened to me.
I didn't go under.

129
00:09:56,874 --> 00:09:59,544
Most people don't believe
they do the first time.

130
00:09:59,710 --> 00:10:02,497
- Well, I know that, sir...
- But that is not your case.

131
00:10:02,672 --> 00:10:05,588
Oh, no, sir. No. Is that all?

132
00:10:05,966 --> 00:10:10,046
On Wednesday, when we
meet again, I want to discuss...

133
00:10:13,224 --> 00:10:17,055
- What are you doing there?
- Taking off my shoe and...

134
00:10:17,394 --> 00:10:22,352
...sock.
- Any particular reason, or just bored?

135
00:10:25,194 --> 00:10:27,436
See you all Wednesday.

136
00:10:29,198 --> 00:10:31,274
Out like a light.

137
00:10:31,450 --> 00:10:33,157
If you don't remember,
he was telling you

138
00:10:33,327 --> 00:10:34,738
to take off your shoes and socks.

139
00:10:36,496 --> 00:10:38,454
Oh, Marc,
did you receive one of these?

140
00:10:39,958 --> 00:10:42,414
Oh, just routine meeting,
nothing important.

141
00:10:42,585 --> 00:10:44,662
Doctor, could I see you
for just one minute, please?

142
00:10:44,838 --> 00:10:46,499
- Don't you feel well?
- Yeah, sure, sure.

143
00:10:46,673 --> 00:10:48,666
But I gotta talk to you
about something important.

144
00:10:48,841 --> 00:10:51,049
If you call my secretary...
I'll see you this afternoon.

145
00:10:51,217 --> 00:10:54,090
- She'll make an appointment.
- But it's just one question, that's all.

146
00:10:54,264 --> 00:10:55,972
Couldn't you ask me
at a Wednesday lecture?

147
00:10:56,140 --> 00:10:58,679
If you come a little early,
I'm sure it's possible...

148
00:10:59,185 --> 00:11:00,810
Oh, my God.

149
00:11:00,979 --> 00:11:02,722
Come in. Come here, hey.

150
00:11:02,897 --> 00:11:07,190
Come, come.
This way, please. This way.

151
00:11:07,360 --> 00:11:12,354
Come in. Here.
Yes. Come in, come in.

152
00:11:13,658 --> 00:11:15,817
This way, this way, please.

153
00:11:17,119 --> 00:11:19,112
Here, come in.

154
00:11:20,456 --> 00:11:23,706
You're doing that
on posthypnotic suggestion.

155
00:11:23,877 --> 00:11:25,537
Oh, no.

156
00:11:26,212 --> 00:11:28,703
Turn around.

157
00:11:28,881 --> 00:11:31,039
I'm terribly sorry.

158
00:11:31,217 --> 00:11:33,044
Is anything else coming off?

159
00:11:33,219 --> 00:11:36,552
- Of course not. Here, your shoe.
- You're sure?

160
00:11:36,722 --> 00:11:38,881
That's quite a weapon
you have got there.

161
00:11:39,058 --> 00:11:44,847
Boy, you fellas must have
one glorious night after another.

162
00:11:45,021 --> 00:11:46,682
I mean...

163
00:11:48,108 --> 00:11:49,982
What's the matter?

164
00:11:50,402 --> 00:11:53,273
- This just isn't my day.
- Come. Come sit down.

165
00:11:55,867 --> 00:11:57,573
You'll feel better in a moment.

166
00:11:57,742 --> 00:11:59,403
Sit down.

167
00:12:00,620 --> 00:12:04,071
- Oh, God.
- Now, what did...?

168
00:12:04,666 --> 00:12:07,583
Oh, rats.

169
00:12:10,422 --> 00:12:12,544
Thank you.

170
00:12:27,605 --> 00:12:31,520
Oh, God.
Don't you hate cigarettes?

171
00:12:31,692 --> 00:12:34,148
Now, what did you
want to ask me?

172
00:12:34,696 --> 00:12:36,937
What I wanted to ask you was this:

173
00:12:37,114 --> 00:12:39,236
Doctor, do you think...?

174
00:12:39,408 --> 00:12:42,741
I mean, can people really be
hypnotized out of something?

175
00:12:42,912 --> 00:12:44,951
I mean, of something like smoking.

176
00:12:45,122 --> 00:12:49,369
It's stuck in the dictionary. I mean, can
you see how yellow my fingers are?

177
00:12:49,544 --> 00:12:51,535
I beg your pardon?

178
00:12:52,629 --> 00:12:56,414
Aren't you looking for a piece
of paper with an address on it?

179
00:12:56,884 --> 00:12:59,089
- Yes.
- Don't you have a dictionary?

180
00:13:00,429 --> 00:13:01,971
Well, yes.

181
00:13:02,639 --> 00:13:04,466
Well, just see if it's in there.

182
00:13:04,642 --> 00:13:09,220
You see, the other night I heard
this discussion going on in the bathtub,

183
00:13:09,394 --> 00:13:13,939
on the radio, and this man said...

184
00:13:14,108 --> 00:13:15,935
It's under X.

185
00:13:16,986 --> 00:13:19,276
He said you could be
hypnotized out of it

186
00:13:19,447 --> 00:13:21,772
without getting something else
instead, you know,

187
00:13:21,949 --> 00:13:24,699
like fat or nervous or acne.

188
00:13:24,869 --> 00:13:27,539
- Miss...
- Gamble.

189
00:13:27,998 --> 00:13:31,164
What about this address?

190
00:13:31,835 --> 00:13:36,875
- Isn't that the one you're looking for?
- Yes, but how did you do it?

191
00:13:37,548 --> 00:13:41,083
I don't know. I just saw you
looking around for something

192
00:13:41,261 --> 00:13:43,502
and wondered what it was and...

193
00:13:43,680 --> 00:13:45,221
You know, I knew.

194
00:13:47,100 --> 00:13:49,425
Very well,
I won't pry into trade secrets.

195
00:13:49,602 --> 00:13:51,510
Yeah.
About this yellow-finger problem...

196
00:13:51,687 --> 00:13:53,311
Can you do any other tricks?

197
00:13:54,148 --> 00:13:58,893
No. You see, I only have until
tomorrow night, and I was desperate.

198
00:13:59,070 --> 00:14:01,607
And that's why I busted on
your lecture, so I could meet you...

199
00:14:01,781 --> 00:14:02,895
What else do you do?

200
00:14:07,619 --> 00:14:09,695
Come on, you can trust me.

201
00:14:12,791 --> 00:14:14,369
Well...

202
00:14:16,044 --> 00:14:18,037
...sometimes...

203
00:14:19,089 --> 00:14:23,383
...I do get the feeling when
the phone's gonna ring.

204
00:14:24,177 --> 00:14:28,389
Or when someone' s
gonna drop in.

205
00:14:28,557 --> 00:14:30,383
So I wait.

206
00:14:31,059 --> 00:14:34,226
And sometimes I can tell
when people

207
00:14:34,395 --> 00:14:36,305
are thinking about me,
so I'll go to see them.

208
00:14:36,481 --> 00:14:38,888
I mean, you know, if I like them.

209
00:14:40,068 --> 00:14:41,859
And

210
00:14:42,237 --> 00:14:44,146
that's about all.

211
00:14:44,323 --> 00:14:45,401
No.

212
00:14:45,572 --> 00:14:47,862
That's all. That's all.

213
00:14:54,206 --> 00:14:55,582
I make flowers grow.

214
00:14:57,752 --> 00:15:02,294
- You make flowers grow?
- Fast. I mean, fast.

215
00:15:02,798 --> 00:15:04,174
And how do you do that?

216
00:15:05,259 --> 00:15:08,758
I don't know.
Doctor, about these cigarettes...

217
00:15:08,929 --> 00:15:13,390
Well, why don't you
just make them disappear.

218
00:15:15,353 --> 00:15:18,637
I don't blame you.
I know it sounds...

219
00:15:18,939 --> 00:15:20,315
It sounds so silly.

220
00:15:20,482 --> 00:15:23,518
Well, never mind, doctor.

221
00:15:24,611 --> 00:15:28,823
I'm really sorry I bothered you.

222
00:15:29,449 --> 00:15:31,240
Thanks anyway.

223
00:15:31,909 --> 00:15:35,279
Oh, answer your phone.

224
00:15:43,630 --> 00:15:47,710
Yes?
Yes, Dr Chabot speaking.

225
00:15:48,968 --> 00:15:51,542
Yes, Conrad. I'm coming.

226
00:15:52,639 --> 00:15:53,671
Order me a...

227
00:15:54,473 --> 00:15:56,467
Double whiskey.

228
00:15:56,642 --> 00:16:00,593
And you thought she saw it
sticking out of the dictionary

229
00:16:00,772 --> 00:16:02,479
on the other side of the room.

230
00:16:02,648 --> 00:16:04,688
Remarkable, isn't it?

231
00:16:04,859 --> 00:16:09,817
- And you think it was a trick?
- She couldn't have guessed it.

232
00:16:10,155 --> 00:16:13,571
Marc, I know as a psychiatrist
I could have my couch taken away

233
00:16:13,741 --> 00:16:19,164
from me for this, but you don't think
by any chance this could be a case

234
00:16:20,166 --> 00:16:23,120
of extrasensory perception, ESP?

235
00:16:23,294 --> 00:16:25,085
All right.

236
00:16:25,253 --> 00:16:27,496
Find the girl, hypnotize her
and prove to yourself

237
00:16:27,673 --> 00:16:29,547
whether or not it was a trick.

238
00:16:29,758 --> 00:16:32,001
You're against scientific research?

239
00:16:32,219 --> 00:16:36,466
How can ESP be called a science
when there is no scientific proof

240
00:16:36,640 --> 00:16:39,677
- that ESP exists?
- What do you mean, exists?

241
00:16:39,852 --> 00:16:42,342
Two people have
the same thought at the same time.

242
00:16:42,521 --> 00:16:44,429
It's happened millions of times.
It exists,

243
00:16:44,605 --> 00:16:46,398
but psychiatry calls it coincidence.

244
00:16:46,566 --> 00:16:49,650
- That's what it is.
- Many people are not so certain,

245
00:16:49,820 --> 00:16:53,070
- and for a very good scientific reason.
- Rubbish.

246
00:16:53,240 --> 00:16:56,240
Pure, unadulterated rubbish.

247
00:17:05,710 --> 00:17:10,870
Violet. Lily. Rose.

248
00:17:11,257 --> 00:17:13,214
Mrs Hatch?

249
00:17:18,223 --> 00:17:20,262
This is my address
for that lunch tomorrow.

250
00:17:20,433 --> 00:17:22,342
- You can type it now.
- Oh, doctor, there's a...

251
00:17:22,519 --> 00:17:26,018
When you've finished, telephone
every student in my 11:00 class

252
00:17:26,188 --> 00:17:29,105
until you find someone who
remembers the name of the girl

253
00:17:29,275 --> 00:17:31,647
I hypnotized by mistake
this morning and...

254
00:17:31,819 --> 00:17:33,894
Oh, you mean Daisy Gamble?

255
00:17:34,446 --> 00:17:36,190
Will you please tell me
how you knew that?

256
00:17:36,365 --> 00:17:39,070
Well, she told me.
She's in the waiting room.

257
00:17:52,839 --> 00:17:54,583
- Miss Gamble?
- Oh, hello, doctor.

258
00:17:54,758 --> 00:17:57,331
Hello. This way, please.

259
00:18:04,018 --> 00:18:06,934
- No calls, Mrs Hatch.
- I'll go to work on your address.

260
00:18:07,103 --> 00:18:09,013
Did you lose another one?

261
00:18:09,189 --> 00:18:11,858
No. Follow me.

262
00:18:13,777 --> 00:18:15,769
- Now, Miss Gamble...
- I'll make it quick.

263
00:18:15,946 --> 00:18:18,437
Do you know the name of a good
hypnotist I can go and talk to

264
00:18:18,615 --> 00:18:20,690
and see if he could help me lay off
these cigarettes

265
00:18:20,867 --> 00:18:23,358
before tomorrow night, or else
Warren won't get that job, see?

266
00:18:23,537 --> 00:18:26,905
Then I won't bother you any more.
Do you understand? Understand.

267
00:18:27,082 --> 00:18:30,166
You don't even know who Warren is.
Oh, he's my fiancé.

268
00:18:31,793 --> 00:18:33,372
Go on.

269
00:18:34,089 --> 00:18:36,044
- Go on?
- Yes.

270
00:18:36,673 --> 00:18:41,917
Well, you see, over here, you know,
in the United States, they have

271
00:18:42,097 --> 00:18:45,299
these big companies that send out
these personnel directors

272
00:18:45,474 --> 00:18:49,306
to these colleges to sign up
the bright students and their wives.

273
00:18:49,479 --> 00:18:53,227
Well, Warren...
Remember? He's my fiancé.

274
00:18:53,398 --> 00:18:56,317
He's graduating in the top 2 percent
of the business school

275
00:18:56,485 --> 00:18:58,975
and Chemical Foods, Inc.,
wanna give him a lifetime contract,

276
00:18:59,154 --> 00:19:01,194
see, and I can ruin it. I mean,

277
00:19:01,365 --> 00:19:03,856
you know, if they don't like me.
I mean, that's that.

278
00:19:04,035 --> 00:19:05,694
And they're not gonna like me.

279
00:19:05,870 --> 00:19:07,197
Because Warren told me, you know,

280
00:19:07,370 --> 00:19:09,613
that they don't like addicts,
and I'm an addict.

281
00:19:09,789 --> 00:19:11,368
And I'm an addicted addict.
I can't stop

282
00:19:11,541 --> 00:19:13,368
unless somebody
like you can make me.

283
00:19:13,544 --> 00:19:15,251
Is that possible?

284
00:19:15,420 --> 00:19:18,836
It's possible, provided it's not
a symptom of neurosis, or...

285
00:19:20,050 --> 00:19:23,335
No, no, I'm normal. I swear.
I'm just an addict, that's all.

286
00:19:23,512 --> 00:19:28,007
Last year I took some of these
vocational-guidance tests, you know,

287
00:19:28,183 --> 00:19:31,883
not for a job, but for Warren
to get to know me better,

288
00:19:32,061 --> 00:19:33,306
and you know the results?

289
00:19:33,938 --> 00:19:35,931
What?

290
00:19:36,357 --> 00:19:40,106
Healthy, adjusted
and no character.

291
00:19:40,278 --> 00:19:45,616
I mean, no character of any kind.
I mean, not even any characteristics.

292
00:19:45,782 --> 00:19:49,117
You see, tomorrow night,
I've gotta have dinner with Warren

293
00:19:49,286 --> 00:19:50,829
and one
of these personnel directors.

294
00:19:50,997 --> 00:19:54,330
So, what do I do about
these rotten, miserable...?

295
00:19:54,499 --> 00:19:55,615
Do you want one?

296
00:19:55,793 --> 00:19:57,703
No, no, thank you.

297
00:20:00,130 --> 00:20:01,625
How old are you, Miss Gamble?

298
00:20:04,176 --> 00:20:06,003
Twenty-two.

299
00:20:06,720 --> 00:20:08,843
And how old were you
when you started smoking?

300
00:20:09,181 --> 00:20:12,515
Twelve. See, I had
this cousin, Harvey,

301
00:20:12,685 --> 00:20:14,392
who came to visit us,
and he was smoking.

302
00:20:14,562 --> 00:20:16,055
You know, he dared me to try.

303
00:20:16,229 --> 00:20:18,353
Well, he was only 9,
what could I do?

304
00:20:18,523 --> 00:20:20,231
Of course.

305
00:20:20,401 --> 00:20:22,725
Miss Gamble,
I will try to help you today.

306
00:20:22,902 --> 00:20:25,773
But from tomorrow on,
you'll have to go to someone else.

307
00:20:25,948 --> 00:20:29,316
And if you call me tomorrow, I'll give
you the name of another doctor.

308
00:20:29,493 --> 00:20:31,449
Sit here, please.

309
00:20:31,995 --> 00:20:34,664
- You mean now?
- Yes, now.

310
00:20:34,831 --> 00:20:41,794
Oh, doctor. I don't know how I can
ever thank you. I mean, really, that is...

311
00:20:42,881 --> 00:20:46,581
- I didn't expect, you know...
- Never mind that, just sit down.

312
00:20:48,636 --> 00:20:50,178
Good.

313
00:21:02,816 --> 00:21:04,311
Please.

314
00:21:07,155 --> 00:21:09,027
That's it.

315
00:21:10,157 --> 00:21:12,281
Just relax now.

316
00:21:17,080 --> 00:21:19,156
Relax.

317
00:21:25,589 --> 00:21:30,049
Now, Miss Gamble, I want you to try,
if you can, to imagine that you see...

318
00:21:30,219 --> 00:21:31,878
I see it.

319
00:21:32,804 --> 00:21:35,011
- What?
- A window.

320
00:21:36,892 --> 00:21:38,517
That's right, a window.

321
00:21:38,685 --> 00:21:40,927
Now, keep staring at that window

322
00:21:41,104 --> 00:21:44,307
until slowly, very slowly,
the window begins...

323
00:21:44,483 --> 00:21:46,226
It's open.

324
00:21:46,652 --> 00:21:48,311
That's right.

325
00:21:48,695 --> 00:21:51,945
And now the dark of night is...

326
00:21:52,157 --> 00:21:55,110
Oh, well, you know the rest, go on.

327
00:22:05,003 --> 00:22:08,419
- Can you hear me, Miss Gamble?
- Yes.

328
00:22:09,549 --> 00:22:11,671
Miss Gamble, if you truly wish
to stop smoking,

329
00:22:11,842 --> 00:22:14,001
I would like you
to raise your left hand.

330
00:22:27,858 --> 00:22:29,732
Drop your hand.

331
00:22:30,986 --> 00:22:35,031
When I awaken you, you will find
that your desire for cigarettes

332
00:22:35,198 --> 00:22:37,689
will grow less and less,
and when you want a cigarette,

333
00:22:37,868 --> 00:22:40,702
your ability to resist it will grow
stronger and stronger.

334
00:22:40,871 --> 00:22:42,448
- Do you understand, Miss Gamble?
- Yes.

335
00:22:42,872 --> 00:22:44,665
Good.

336
00:22:49,379 --> 00:22:51,870
Now, open your eyes.

337
00:22:53,716 --> 00:22:55,876
Miss Gamble, this morning
you were kind enough

338
00:22:56,052 --> 00:22:58,175
to help me find an address I'd lost.

339
00:22:58,346 --> 00:23:00,423
- Do you remember?
- Yes.

340
00:23:00,598 --> 00:23:04,726
It was quite a trick.
Do you know how you did it?

341
00:23:04,894 --> 00:23:06,436
Yes.

342
00:23:07,146 --> 00:23:10,598
I thought so. How?

343
00:23:11,860 --> 00:23:13,852
Well,

344
00:23:14,487 --> 00:23:17,109
I saw you looking around
for something

345
00:23:17,282 --> 00:23:20,448
and I wondered what it was.
And all of a sudden I knew.

346
00:23:22,829 --> 00:23:24,905
- You knew what?
- Where it was.

347
00:23:26,666 --> 00:23:28,658
- That's all?
- That's all.

348
00:23:31,337 --> 00:23:33,129
I see.

349
00:23:33,297 --> 00:23:37,758
- Do you really?
- Of course, a child can understand it.

350
00:23:39,970 --> 00:23:41,928
Who taught it to you?

351
00:23:43,181 --> 00:23:46,681
I don't know. I suppose I got it
from Winnie Wainwhisle.

352
00:23:47,311 --> 00:23:48,936
Who is she?

353
00:23:49,104 --> 00:23:51,013
- Nobody.
- Nobody?

354
00:23:51,607 --> 00:23:53,149
I mean, nobody anymore.
She's dead.

355
00:23:54,693 --> 00:23:58,607
But before she died
she taught it to you.

356
00:23:58,780 --> 00:24:00,738
- No.
- No?

357
00:24:01,282 --> 00:24:02,446
No.

358
00:24:02,617 --> 00:24:05,239
- But you said you got it from her.
- Yeah.

359
00:24:10,292 --> 00:24:12,534
Can you remember an incident

360
00:24:12,710 --> 00:24:15,118
when you saw Winnie Wainwhisle
perform the same trick?

361
00:24:15,296 --> 00:24:16,459
Oh, sure, lots of them.

362
00:24:16,631 --> 00:24:18,422
- Just one.
- Okay.

363
00:24:18,592 --> 00:24:20,631
Where did it happen?

364
00:24:23,805 --> 00:24:25,513
In London.

365
00:24:26,808 --> 00:24:29,132
- You know, in England?
- London?

366
00:24:29,310 --> 00:24:32,762
- What were you doing in London?
- I was with Winnie Wainwhisle.

367
00:24:33,898 --> 00:24:35,724
Was it lately?

368
00:24:36,775 --> 00:24:38,852
Well, was it before you were 15?

369
00:24:41,114 --> 00:24:43,320
Before you were 10?

370
00:24:43,616 --> 00:24:46,984
- Yeah.
- Before you were 5?

371
00:24:48,788 --> 00:24:51,076
- What was it she found?
- A gold locket.

372
00:24:52,916 --> 00:24:54,161
I see.

373
00:24:54,334 --> 00:24:57,502
- It was the one my husband gave me.
- Oh, really.

374
00:24:57,672 --> 00:25:00,708
And how old was your little husband?
Three and a half? Four?

375
00:25:00,882 --> 00:25:04,002
No. He was...

376
00:25:04,553 --> 00:25:07,470
Let's see, 59. Yeah, that's right.

377
00:25:07,639 --> 00:25:10,046
Because he was exactly
35 years older than I.

378
00:25:10,683 --> 00:25:12,926
- What?
- Than me?

379
00:25:13,520 --> 00:25:15,144
Thirty-five years older?

380
00:25:15,772 --> 00:25:19,390
Well, I know it's a lot, but he was rich
and he had a title, so, what the hell.

381
00:25:19,568 --> 00:25:22,770
That would make you 24.
How did you get to be 24?

382
00:25:23,405 --> 00:25:24,946
Well, after 23.

383
00:25:25,115 --> 00:25:28,698
But that makes you two years older
than when you sat down.

384
00:25:29,077 --> 00:25:32,411
Miss Gamble, how can you go back
to a time before you were 5

385
00:25:32,580 --> 00:25:36,412
and say you are 24?
Explain that to me further.

386
00:25:45,718 --> 00:25:46,797
Miss Gamble.

387
00:25:48,096 --> 00:25:49,340
Yes?

388
00:25:50,723 --> 00:25:53,474
What year are you remembering?

389
00:25:56,728 --> 00:25:58,009
1814.

390
00:26:13,245 --> 00:26:17,574
Now, listen carefully. You're saying
that you were alive in 1814.

391
00:26:17,750 --> 00:26:21,118
Very well. I want you to tell me
everything you can about yourself,

392
00:26:21,295 --> 00:26:22,837
beginning with your name.

393
00:26:23,005 --> 00:26:24,463
You do remember your name?

394
00:26:26,174 --> 00:26:28,083
My name?

395
00:26:28,594 --> 00:26:30,254
Gee, I don't know if I can do that.

396
00:26:31,304 --> 00:26:34,258
I mean, boy, that's tough.

397
00:26:36,768 --> 00:26:40,386
- I'm Daisy Gamble.
- Take your time.

398
00:26:40,605 --> 00:26:43,013
Maybe I was called
something else once...

399
00:26:44,943 --> 00:26:48,276
...but the only name I...

400
00:26:50,406 --> 00:26:54,486
I mean, my name has always...

401
00:26:57,037 --> 00:26:59,529
My name is...

402
00:27:14,680 --> 00:27:16,886
My name is Melinda.

403
00:27:17,683 --> 00:27:21,431
Melinda Winifred Waine Tentrees.

404
00:27:22,354 --> 00:27:31,773
And I am appalled and stunned
at this outrageous inquisition.

405
00:27:31,948 --> 00:27:37,451
- Inquisition, Lady Tentrees?
- From the day this trial began,

406
00:27:37,620 --> 00:27:40,619
you have been coiled
like a cobra ready to strike.

407
00:27:40,789 --> 00:27:44,157
Trying to make me crawl
and cower and cringe

408
00:27:44,334 --> 00:27:47,336
and admit to your monstrous lies.

409
00:27:47,503 --> 00:27:49,164
But you shall not succeed.

410
00:27:49,338 --> 00:27:51,746
I shall speak only the truth.

411
00:27:52,467 --> 00:27:54,341
I hope so.

412
00:27:57,305 --> 00:28:00,756
Now you say your name
is Melinda Tentrees?

413
00:28:00,934 --> 00:28:03,685
Would you tell the court
what knowledge you have

414
00:28:03,853 --> 00:28:07,103
of the tragic voyage
of the frigate Westerly.

415
00:28:07,273 --> 00:28:11,650
I know nothing about that unfortunate
vessel except that it sailed.

416
00:28:11,819 --> 00:28:14,605
Yet you advised your husband
not to insure the Westerly.

417
00:28:14,779 --> 00:28:16,323
How did you know
it would never return?

418
00:28:16,490 --> 00:28:19,195
You have asked me that question

419
00:28:19,368 --> 00:28:23,947
again and again.
I have answered it again and again.

420
00:28:24,707 --> 00:28:28,539
The Caroline sailed
two days after the Westerly,

421
00:28:28,710 --> 00:28:31,118
also never to return,

422
00:28:31,297 --> 00:28:36,837
insurance also rejected by
Pelham of London, upon your advice.

423
00:28:37,010 --> 00:28:38,802
How did you know
it would never return?

424
00:28:39,138 --> 00:28:40,846
I do not know.

425
00:28:41,015 --> 00:28:43,588
I do not know.

426
00:28:43,766 --> 00:28:45,843
You don't know if your name is
Melinda Tentrees?

427
00:28:46,019 --> 00:28:48,972
Of course I know my name is
Melinda Tentrees, dunce.

428
00:28:49,147 --> 00:28:53,228
And I also know my husband's name
and how old we are and where we live,

429
00:28:53,401 --> 00:28:57,066
the street,
the number and the city.

430
00:28:57,238 --> 00:29:02,529
- I have a breathtaking grasp of things.
- How long have you been married?

431
00:29:02,703 --> 00:29:05,027
Robert and I have been married
for three

432
00:29:05,204 --> 00:29:09,913
tumultuous, passionate,
Scheherazadian years.

433
00:29:10,751 --> 00:29:13,955
Your husband must be
remarkable for his age.

434
00:29:14,130 --> 00:29:15,921
He's remarkable for any age.

435
00:29:16,591 --> 00:29:19,427
- But still, at 59.
- Fifty-nine? Ass!

436
00:29:19,593 --> 00:29:22,844
That was my first husband.
Robert is 31.

437
00:29:23,014 --> 00:29:27,924
What was your
first husband's name?

438
00:29:28,102 --> 00:29:30,427
Lord Percy Moorepark.

439
00:29:30,605 --> 00:29:35,065
Poor, fumbling, old, rich thing.

440
00:29:35,233 --> 00:29:39,018
But you heard a witness testify to
having seen you on the London docks

441
00:29:39,196 --> 00:29:42,281
on the night of November 14th,
consorting in secret

442
00:29:42,450 --> 00:29:43,825
with a known enemy of the crown.

443
00:29:43,992 --> 00:29:46,032
- He lies!
- Wait, wait, wait.

444
00:29:46,203 --> 00:29:51,410
I'm so glad you interrupted.
I cannot bear this trial another minute.

445
00:29:52,876 --> 00:29:56,541
- What are you on trial for?
- Oh, please.

446
00:29:56,714 --> 00:29:58,042
Very well, never mind.

447
00:29:58,631 --> 00:30:00,957
You were going to tell me
about an incident

448
00:30:01,134 --> 00:30:04,966
when Winnie Wainwhisle
finds something for you.

449
00:30:05,305 --> 00:30:06,965
Yes.

450
00:30:07,724 --> 00:30:10,678
It was the day I first met Robert.

451
00:30:11,227 --> 00:30:14,478
What a glorious day it was.

452
00:30:14,647 --> 00:30:18,479
- Where are you?
- Where we met.

453
00:30:18,652 --> 00:30:22,234
At the Royal Pavilion at Brighton
three years ago.

454
00:30:36,128 --> 00:30:38,795
Percy. Percy, put on
your spectacles at once.

455
00:30:38,963 --> 00:30:40,505
Hurry.

456
00:30:41,007 --> 00:30:44,042
Now look directly across the lawn.

457
00:30:44,676 --> 00:30:46,551
Do you see Diana Smallwood?

458
00:30:46,720 --> 00:30:50,172
- Unmistakably Diana Smallwood.
- Who is that with her?

459
00:30:50,350 --> 00:30:51,926
Robert Tentrees.

460
00:30:52,101 --> 00:30:54,508
- What does he do?
- As little as possible.

461
00:30:54,686 --> 00:30:57,640
Joseph Pelham was complaining
about him the other day.

462
00:30:57,815 --> 00:31:00,649
He knows Tentrees' father
and gave the boy a position.

463
00:31:00,818 --> 00:31:05,065
Maritime insurance.
You know, old ships at sea.

464
00:31:05,239 --> 00:31:06,817
- Is he married?
- No.

465
00:31:06,989 --> 00:31:09,564
But he should have been,
many times.

466
00:31:10,702 --> 00:31:12,779
And he will be soon.

467
00:31:12,954 --> 00:31:15,326
I can't wait to hear
how you arrange that.

468
00:32:14,098 --> 00:32:21,144
My dearest love
Who existed in a dream

469
00:32:21,313 --> 00:32:23,555
Till this evening

470
00:32:23,731 --> 00:32:29,521
When a wave came
And swept me out to sea

471
00:32:30,781 --> 00:32:33,532
None of the loves
That you have known

472
00:32:33,700 --> 00:32:37,116
Could prepare you for the love

473
00:32:37,287 --> 00:32:42,162
Raging everywhere in me

474
00:32:42,334 --> 00:32:44,326
For all the arms

475
00:32:44,502 --> 00:32:48,998
That have covered you
The hands that have touched you

476
00:32:49,173 --> 00:32:54,629
And the lips you have lingered on
Before

477
00:32:55,638 --> 00:33:00,763
Added together would be less
Than an olive

478
00:33:00,935 --> 00:33:06,522
In the banquet of love
I have in store

479
00:33:07,316 --> 00:33:12,311
Love seasoned to entice

480
00:33:12,487 --> 00:33:17,398
Love with all the trimmings
Filled with spice

481
00:33:17,576 --> 00:33:22,617
Love flavoured to your whim

482
00:33:22,790 --> 00:33:25,197
Served piping hot

483
00:33:25,584 --> 00:33:31,669
With all the trimmings

484
00:33:39,764 --> 00:33:46,266
For I'll decode every breath

485
00:33:46,438 --> 00:33:50,020
And every sigh
Till your every lover's wish

486
00:33:50,191 --> 00:33:54,604
Is fulfilled before it's made

487
00:33:54,780 --> 00:34:01,031
Toss in some jealousy and doubt
Should it be required

488
00:34:01,202 --> 00:34:07,951
Not rest till there's
Nothing more desired

489
00:34:08,126 --> 00:34:12,586
Thus loving as I do

490
00:34:12,755 --> 00:34:17,464
Never, never will you ever be untrue

491
00:34:17,635 --> 00:34:23,258
Having love with all the trimmings

492
00:34:23,641 --> 00:34:26,974
Waiting home

493
00:34:27,143 --> 00:34:31,224
For you

494
00:34:51,501 --> 00:34:55,452
Gentlemen. His Highness.

495
00:34:59,009 --> 00:35:01,333
Chef, my good fellow.

496
00:35:02,763 --> 00:35:04,008
Your Royal Highness.

497
00:35:04,181 --> 00:35:05,888
Never in history
have taste buds been

498
00:35:06,057 --> 00:35:07,800
so delectably treated
as they were tonight

499
00:35:07,976 --> 00:35:10,894
with your extraordinary
salmon mousse.

500
00:35:11,062 --> 00:35:13,304
Served with cream
and vin rouge sauce.

501
00:35:13,480 --> 00:35:16,601
Garnished with truffles
and exotic herbs.

502
00:35:16,901 --> 00:35:18,894
You seem to know this woman.
Who is she?

503
00:35:19,445 --> 00:35:20,773
Winnie Wainwhisle.

504
00:35:21,488 --> 00:35:25,700
Do you have a name for this,
if I may be allowed a Gallic pun,

505
00:35:26,202 --> 00:35:28,657
this chef-d'oeuvre?

506
00:35:28,829 --> 00:35:31,784
Yes, with pleasure.
Come this way.

507
00:35:31,957 --> 00:35:36,120
I humbly christen it
Salmon Beurre Brigette.

508
00:35:36,295 --> 00:35:39,497
- To my chef.
- To the chef.

509
00:35:43,468 --> 00:35:45,675
- Melinda.
- Mum.

510
00:35:45,846 --> 00:35:47,886
- Is that your mother?
- Yes.

511
00:35:48,056 --> 00:35:49,302
How are you, Melinda?

512
00:35:49,475 --> 00:35:51,182
Mum, did you ever hear
of Robert Tentrees?

513
00:35:51,351 --> 00:35:54,471
Robert Tentrees?
He's not your kind, Melinda.

514
00:35:54,645 --> 00:35:56,224
Hasn't got a halfpenny to his name.

515
00:35:56,398 --> 00:35:58,473
- Here, I got something for you.
- What?

516
00:35:58,650 --> 00:36:01,687
- Your locket.
- Where'd you find it?

517
00:36:02,071 --> 00:36:05,107
Under the ambassador's night table.

518
00:36:05,991 --> 00:36:08,826
- Well, that's a bit of luck.
- What about this Robert Tentrees?

519
00:36:08,994 --> 00:36:10,951
- Is he here tonight?
- Mum.

520
00:36:11,121 --> 00:36:14,703
Mum, he's here, and I met him. And
I love him and I'm gonna marry him.

521
00:36:14,874 --> 00:36:17,081
- Marry him?
- But you've got a husband.

522
00:36:17,251 --> 00:36:18,960
I'll divorce him.

523
00:36:19,129 --> 00:36:21,121
And don't you worry about
us not having any money.

524
00:36:21,298 --> 00:36:22,673
In two years' time,

525
00:36:22,840 --> 00:36:26,506
I'll make Robert Tentrees
one of the richest men in England.

526
00:36:26,678 --> 00:36:28,303
That good-for-nothing.
How in the world

527
00:36:28,471 --> 00:36:31,009
do you expect to make the likes of...?

528
00:36:31,474 --> 00:36:32,885
No.

529
00:36:33,893 --> 00:36:37,142
No, Melinda. Don't misuse
your talents. Please.

530
00:36:37,438 --> 00:36:41,187
Or God knows in how many
lifetimes you'll be paying for it.

531
00:36:41,358 --> 00:36:43,435
What talents?
What is she talking about?

532
00:36:47,406 --> 00:36:48,817
Well.

533
00:36:49,534 --> 00:36:51,989
- There you are, milady.
- Thank you.

534
00:36:52,286 --> 00:36:53,945
Thank you.

535
00:37:07,884 --> 00:37:14,053
For I'll decode every breath

536
00:37:14,225 --> 00:37:17,924
And every sigh
Till your every lover's wish

537
00:37:18,103 --> 00:37:22,432
Is fulfilled before it's made

538
00:37:22,608 --> 00:37:25,893
Toss in some jealousy and doubt

539
00:37:26,069 --> 00:37:28,774
Should it be required

540
00:37:28,947 --> 00:37:35,779
Not rest till there's
Nothing more desired

541
00:37:35,954 --> 00:37:40,247
Thus loving as I do

542
00:37:40,416 --> 00:37:45,411
Never, never will you ever be untrue

543
00:37:45,589 --> 00:37:51,424
Having love with all the trimmings

544
00:37:51,594 --> 00:37:54,797
Waiting home

545
00:37:54,971 --> 00:38:00,263
For you

546
00:38:17,661 --> 00:38:20,117
And just how do you expect
to get a divorce?

547
00:38:21,039 --> 00:38:23,447
I'm going to be caught
red-handed, dearie. That's how.

548
00:38:23,626 --> 00:38:25,913
Caught red-handed.

549
00:38:26,837 --> 00:38:28,294
- There.
- Where?

550
00:38:28,463 --> 00:38:29,708
Here.

551
00:38:30,216 --> 00:38:32,836
Oh, Percy.

552
00:38:33,009 --> 00:38:36,793
Percy, I knew you'd leave
your spectacles at home. Here.

553
00:38:36,972 --> 00:38:38,799
Here is your other pair.

554
00:38:38,974 --> 00:38:41,096
Oh, thank you very much.

555
00:38:48,066 --> 00:38:49,809
And is it not true, Lady Moorepark,

556
00:38:49,984 --> 00:38:52,440
that in the pursuit of illicit passion,

557
00:38:52,612 --> 00:38:55,565
you and Robert Tentrees
met regularly?

558
00:38:55,740 --> 00:39:00,034
Yes. We met frequently, in secret.

559
00:39:00,203 --> 00:39:03,488
Lady Tentrees, I suggest that you
have committed perjury to this court

560
00:39:03,664 --> 00:39:05,788
and that you have consorted
with those involved

561
00:39:05,958 --> 00:39:08,414
in the treasonous plot
against king and country

562
00:39:08,586 --> 00:39:11,338
to destroy 38 British ships at sea.

563
00:39:11,505 --> 00:39:14,458
No! You are trying
to make a criminal out of me.

564
00:39:14,633 --> 00:39:16,673
What? One moment, now.

565
00:39:16,844 --> 00:39:18,468
You admit to these indiscretions?

566
00:39:18,636 --> 00:39:20,676
I am under oath.

567
00:39:20,848 --> 00:39:23,553
I cannot lie. Yes.

568
00:39:23,726 --> 00:39:25,304
Not one written message.

569
00:39:25,852 --> 00:39:28,807
I am under oath. I cannot lie.

570
00:39:28,981 --> 00:39:31,270
- No!
- Wait a moment, now.

571
00:39:31,442 --> 00:39:33,932
I beg you to consider
that she has cheated her...

572
00:39:34,110 --> 00:39:36,566
- Confess a lie!
- Treason...

573
00:39:36,738 --> 00:39:39,027
- Never...
- Stop.

574
00:39:39,199 --> 00:39:42,402
Oh, thank you. I'm exhausted.

575
00:39:43,495 --> 00:39:46,745
- So am I.
- I can't go on with this.

576
00:39:46,916 --> 00:39:48,457
I can't.

577
00:39:48,624 --> 00:39:49,999
I just can't.

578
00:39:51,669 --> 00:39:54,671
Neither can I.
No more questions.

579
00:39:54,839 --> 00:39:56,878
You may sleep until I count to three.

580
00:39:57,050 --> 00:39:59,719
Then you will awaken
completely refreshed

581
00:39:59,886 --> 00:40:02,377
and you'll remember nothing.

582
00:40:02,555 --> 00:40:05,758
Except to smoke less.
Now, sleep.

583
00:40:21,031 --> 00:40:23,736
- Mrs Hatch.
- Yes, doctor?

584
00:40:23,910 --> 00:40:25,902
I've recorded this session.

585
00:40:26,079 --> 00:40:28,569
After I leave, would you make
three copies of it, please.

586
00:40:28,748 --> 00:40:31,701
And send one
to Dr Conrad Fuller.

587
00:40:43,678 --> 00:40:46,763
One, two, three.

588
00:40:52,020 --> 00:40:53,430
How do you feel?

589
00:40:53,605 --> 00:40:55,681
Fine. How'd I do?

590
00:40:56,817 --> 00:40:59,603
Beyond my wildest expectations.

591
00:41:01,361 --> 00:41:03,106
Do you think I'll smoke less
tomorrow night?

592
00:41:03,282 --> 00:41:05,273
I mean, you know, more normal?

593
00:41:05,783 --> 00:41:07,112
Yes, I think so.

594
00:41:07,911 --> 00:41:10,449
Oh, Dr Chabot,

595
00:41:10,622 --> 00:41:12,282
if there's anything I can ever do
for you,

596
00:41:12,457 --> 00:41:15,660
I mean, really, just,
you know, anything.

597
00:41:15,835 --> 00:41:18,042
Pronounce my name "Chabot."

598
00:41:18,796 --> 00:41:22,545
Isn't it C-H-A-B-O-T?

599
00:41:23,468 --> 00:41:24,666
Yes, Chabot.

600
00:41:26,304 --> 00:41:29,091
Oh, well, anything you say.

601
00:41:31,725 --> 00:41:33,101
Thank you.

602
00:41:33,269 --> 00:41:34,728
Well.

603
00:41:35,813 --> 00:41:38,138
- Goodbye.
- Goodbye.

604
00:41:40,067 --> 00:41:41,443
The...

605
00:41:43,570 --> 00:41:45,230
Thank you.

606
00:42:28,656 --> 00:42:30,779
Tad.

607
00:42:32,409 --> 00:42:34,367
Tad.

608
00:42:35,455 --> 00:42:38,289
- Hi.
- Well, well. How are you?

609
00:42:38,458 --> 00:42:40,829
- What are you doing here?
- Well, you know.

610
00:42:41,002 --> 00:42:43,160
Same old thing.

611
00:42:43,338 --> 00:42:46,540
- Looking for myself.
- Yeah, but what are you doing here?

612
00:42:46,715 --> 00:42:51,045
Well, I thought I might
take a course in anatomy.

613
00:42:51,220 --> 00:42:53,793
Maybe I'll find out how you do
all those wonderful things.

614
00:42:53,972 --> 00:42:56,843
No. Oh, for Pete's sake, don't say
anything about that around here.

615
00:42:57,017 --> 00:42:59,390
I mean, will you?
I mean, for Pete's sake.

616
00:42:59,562 --> 00:43:02,231
Why? It's... It's not un-American.

617
00:43:02,397 --> 00:43:06,016
I mean, you've got some kind
of psychic power, that's all.

618
00:43:06,193 --> 00:43:08,102
- I think it's beautiful.
- Yeah, to you, maybe.

619
00:43:08,278 --> 00:43:10,318
That's because you're a nut.

620
00:43:10,488 --> 00:43:11,983
Daisy, a lot of people are psychic.

621
00:43:12,157 --> 00:43:13,652
Fine. I'm sure they're all very nice,

622
00:43:13,826 --> 00:43:16,031
but that is not the group
I'd like to be known as in.

623
00:43:16,202 --> 00:43:18,444
I mean, if Warren ever found out,
he'd never forgive me.

624
00:43:18,622 --> 00:43:20,780
He thinks I'm, you know, normal.

625
00:43:21,500 --> 00:43:24,915
Normal?
Nobody even knows what normal is.

626
00:43:25,086 --> 00:43:26,829
Warren does.

627
00:43:29,174 --> 00:43:30,916
I did write to you

628
00:43:31,092 --> 00:43:34,176
about Warren and me, didn't I?

629
00:43:39,767 --> 00:43:41,475
What are you looking at?

630
00:43:41,644 --> 00:43:44,052
I think you're sexier.

631
00:43:45,023 --> 00:43:48,522
You think sexier? I thought you were
noticing that I'm not smoking.

632
00:43:48,692 --> 00:43:53,071
- Oh, here, excuse me...
- No, no, no! I'm trying to quit.

633
00:43:53,239 --> 00:43:56,940
Where are they? No, no, thanks.

634
00:43:59,663 --> 00:44:01,204
Darn.

635
00:44:03,332 --> 00:44:06,452
Two hours and seven minutes
without a weed.

636
00:44:06,627 --> 00:44:08,252
I gotta tell the doctor.

637
00:44:08,421 --> 00:44:10,079
Doctor? What doctor?

638
00:44:12,633 --> 00:44:15,504
I went to this doctor, you know,
to help me stop smoking.

639
00:44:16,512 --> 00:44:18,219
You went to a doctor for that? Why?

640
00:44:19,348 --> 00:44:22,682
Because five packs a day
is just un-normal.

641
00:44:22,851 --> 00:44:26,100
- Oh, Warren.
- Yeah.

642
00:44:26,271 --> 00:44:30,269
That's him. The one in the chair.
Isn't he dynamic?

643
00:44:30,525 --> 00:44:33,775
Hey, you wanna see the job I'm really
interested in? I mean, this is terrific.

644
00:44:33,945 --> 00:44:36,317
They've got the finest
retirement plan I've ever seen,

645
00:44:36,488 --> 00:44:39,111
and the pension starts
15 years before retirement.

646
00:44:39,284 --> 00:44:40,861
- Fifteen years?
- Can you imagine?

647
00:44:41,035 --> 00:44:43,324
You see, compensation
when you're sick doubles.

648
00:44:43,496 --> 00:44:45,822
They pay for any operation,
including surgery,

649
00:44:45,999 --> 00:44:47,872
and in the event
of mental breakdown,

650
00:44:48,042 --> 00:44:49,916
they pick up the tab
for the sanitarium

651
00:44:50,086 --> 00:44:52,494
for you or your wife,
in the event that she passes.

652
00:44:52,672 --> 00:44:57,298
Boy, when I stop to think I almost
settled for that job in Paris, I could...

653
00:44:57,468 --> 00:45:00,553
What the hell is she growing here,
Yosemite National Park?

654
00:45:00,722 --> 00:45:02,513
I don't know how she does it.

655
00:45:02,682 --> 00:45:05,967
- I planted mine the very same day.
- Where are yours?

656
00:45:07,687 --> 00:45:09,098
There.

657
00:45:16,654 --> 00:45:19,904
Oh, boy, this is embarrassing.
She's gotta cut that out.

658
00:45:20,073 --> 00:45:21,652
I'm so worried
about my nicotine stains.

659
00:45:21,825 --> 00:45:24,660
- Daisy, Daisy, I've gotta talk to you.
- Warren, this is Tad Pringle.

660
00:45:24,829 --> 00:45:27,745
- Hi, fella. Daisy, I've gotta talk to you...
- He used to be my brother.

661
00:45:27,915 --> 00:45:29,623
Really? Your what?

662
00:45:29,791 --> 00:45:34,084
Well, not actually. I mean, his father
was married to my mother once.

663
00:45:34,546 --> 00:45:38,875
Eight years ago. Daisy and I were
very happy. Our parents weren't.

664
00:45:39,051 --> 00:45:41,210
The judge stopped
the fight in the third year.

665
00:45:41,385 --> 00:45:45,716
That's very interesting.
Daisy... You'll... Daisy.

666
00:45:45,974 --> 00:45:48,014
Daisy, I've gotta talk to you
about tomorrow night.

667
00:45:48,185 --> 00:45:49,513
Now, how do you feel?
You nervous?

668
00:45:49,685 --> 00:45:51,429
- Well, l...
- Swell. Just a couple of points

669
00:45:51,605 --> 00:45:54,178
to integrate into the image.
Now, tomorrow night, before dinner,

670
00:45:54,357 --> 00:45:55,437
no whiskey and no martinis.

671
00:45:55,609 --> 00:45:58,478
- Sherry. It's more feminine. Got it?
- Sherry? But I throw up when l...

672
00:45:58,653 --> 00:46:01,144
Swell. Remember about the dress?
Not too low and not too high.

673
00:46:01,322 --> 00:46:02,817
You see, Unkstadder's wife
is coming.

674
00:46:02,991 --> 00:46:05,860
And if she catches him looking
up anything or down anything, that's it.

675
00:46:06,035 --> 00:46:07,364
So tomorrow night, you're a boy.

676
00:46:07,536 --> 00:46:10,075
Oh, and, Daisy, for God's sake,
no opinions.

677
00:46:10,248 --> 00:46:12,869
I mean, talk all you want if you
need anything, but no opinions.

678
00:46:13,042 --> 00:46:14,785
See, they don't like women
to have opinions.

679
00:46:14,961 --> 00:46:17,665
In fact, they don't really like women.
They like wives and mothers.

680
00:46:17,839 --> 00:46:20,079
Let me see your fingers.
Come on, Daisy. Let me see...

681
00:46:20,257 --> 00:46:21,918
Can't you get that nicotine off?

682
00:46:22,092 --> 00:46:24,085
From the knuckles down,
you look like Ho Chi Minh.

683
00:46:24,261 --> 00:46:26,171
Warren, don't worry.
You'll never guess what l...

684
00:46:26,347 --> 00:46:28,006
Come here, Daisy,
I want you to see this.

685
00:46:28,182 --> 00:46:30,933
This is our whole future.
Security unlimited.

686
00:46:31,101 --> 00:46:34,766
Just a few years' work and we
can relax for the rest of our lives.

687
00:46:38,108 --> 00:46:41,193
Yes? Oh, hello, Conrad.

688
00:46:41,361 --> 00:46:43,318
Did you read the transcript?

689
00:46:43,655 --> 00:46:45,149
What you think?

690
00:46:51,288 --> 00:46:53,364
It's amazing, isn't it?

691
00:46:53,832 --> 00:46:56,121
The names? Well, like all these cases,

692
00:46:56,293 --> 00:47:00,955
she must have gotten them
from friends or books or movies.

693
00:47:02,758 --> 00:47:04,465
Look them up?

694
00:47:04,843 --> 00:47:06,551
In what?

695
00:47:07,053 --> 00:47:09,294
Books about England.

696
00:47:09,472 --> 00:47:12,592
Conrad, if you're implying that this
could be a case of reincarnation,

697
00:47:12,767 --> 00:47:15,009
you are sicker than she is.

698
00:47:15,186 --> 00:47:18,721
No, no, I can't see her anymore.
I have no time for all that nonsense.

699
00:47:18,898 --> 00:47:20,607
See you tomorrow.

700
00:47:36,623 --> 00:47:41,001
And from now on, you will find
the third puff of every cigarette

701
00:47:41,170 --> 00:47:43,293
will have a bitter, bitter taste.

702
00:47:43,464 --> 00:47:46,879
Remember, the third puff.

703
00:47:50,138 --> 00:47:51,335
Open your eyes.

704
00:47:56,560 --> 00:47:58,518
Now, Miss Gamble,

705
00:47:58,687 --> 00:48:02,021
yesterday you claimed
to recall a previous life

706
00:48:02,190 --> 00:48:05,560
when your name was
Melinda Waine Moorepark Tentrees.

707
00:48:05,736 --> 00:48:07,277
There's a Winifred in there.

708
00:48:07,445 --> 00:48:11,110
Yes, I know. Now, where
did you get the name Melinda?

709
00:48:12,033 --> 00:48:13,528
From my aunt.

710
00:48:14,328 --> 00:48:15,904
She was the fattest woman in London.

711
00:48:17,497 --> 00:48:19,205
- In London?
- Yeah.

712
00:48:19,373 --> 00:48:21,200
They used to say that
the duke of Westminster

713
00:48:21,376 --> 00:48:24,709
owned everything in London
except one acre, my aunt.

714
00:48:26,714 --> 00:48:28,339
That's very funny.

715
00:48:28,508 --> 00:48:30,999
Then you definitely
have been to London?

716
00:48:32,053 --> 00:48:33,333
Oh, yeah.

717
00:48:34,097 --> 00:48:35,639
How many times?

718
00:48:35,807 --> 00:48:39,056
- Once.
- For how long?

719
00:48:39,226 --> 00:48:40,555
Twenty-eight years.

720
00:48:41,936 --> 00:48:43,977
Twenty-eight years?

721
00:48:44,524 --> 00:48:46,230
How old were you when you left?

722
00:48:46,900 --> 00:48:48,146
Twenty-eight years.

723
00:48:50,404 --> 00:48:53,737
Are you saying
that you left because you...

724
00:48:54,783 --> 00:48:56,159
...died?

725
00:48:57,870 --> 00:48:59,412
Yeah.

726
00:48:59,580 --> 00:49:01,904
What's the matter?

727
00:49:02,082 --> 00:49:05,036
I just hated to die at 28.

728
00:49:05,210 --> 00:49:07,002
I just hope I don't have to do it again.

729
00:49:07,421 --> 00:49:09,746
It's better than 22.

730
00:49:10,841 --> 00:49:13,546
But tell me,
how did you ever climb

731
00:49:13,718 --> 00:49:16,719
from the kitchen maid's daughter
to Lady Moorepark?

732
00:49:16,972 --> 00:49:18,252
How?

733
00:49:18,431 --> 00:49:21,053
Because of a lesson
I learned at the orphanage

734
00:49:21,226 --> 00:49:23,219
where my impoverished mother
placed me as a child.

735
00:49:24,854 --> 00:49:26,183
Where was your father?

736
00:49:26,356 --> 00:49:28,100
Don't be rude.

737
00:49:28,274 --> 00:49:31,145
Our postman, Mr Pimpleton.

738
00:49:31,320 --> 00:49:35,531
And this is Mrs Brickstone himself.

739
00:49:36,116 --> 00:49:38,654
I scrubbed, oh.

740
00:49:38,827 --> 00:49:40,865
And scrubbed, oh.

741
00:49:41,454 --> 00:49:44,408
And scrubbed, oh.

742
00:49:44,916 --> 00:49:47,038
And I ate.

743
00:49:50,337 --> 00:49:53,292
For recreation, I plotted my escape.

744
00:49:53,466 --> 00:49:55,791
I knew the exact location
of the hitching post

745
00:49:55,967 --> 00:49:57,842
on the other side of the wall.

746
00:49:58,011 --> 00:50:02,389
And I had practiced with this rope
for almost two years.

747
00:50:07,480 --> 00:50:11,607
Up and up I went toward freedom.

748
00:50:21,827 --> 00:50:24,033
My new quarters.

749
00:50:31,837 --> 00:50:34,790
I looked around and thought,
"Oh, dear."

750
00:50:34,964 --> 00:50:39,176
Thirty days in this dungeon
with nothing to do.

751
00:50:40,637 --> 00:50:42,843
I found something to do.

752
00:50:43,014 --> 00:50:46,550
Every night, I heard voices
on the other side of the wall,

753
00:50:46,726 --> 00:50:49,513
which aroused my curiosity.

754
00:50:49,687 --> 00:50:52,012
Cor blimey, a secret room.

755
00:50:52,190 --> 00:50:55,607
Just the sort of place you expect
to find a buried treasure.

756
00:50:55,776 --> 00:51:00,486
And what did I find?
A buried treasure.

757
00:51:00,656 --> 00:51:03,657
Next to the name
of every child in the school

758
00:51:03,867 --> 00:51:06,572
was the name
of the real, unknown father.

759
00:51:06,746 --> 00:51:08,490
Except mine, of course.

760
00:51:08,664 --> 00:51:12,578
It was lord this and the duke
of that and the earl of whatnot.

761
00:51:12,752 --> 00:51:14,543
And as I turned the pages,

762
00:51:14,711 --> 00:51:18,128
suddenly, through the dank
mustiness of the room,

763
00:51:18,299 --> 00:51:21,334
I realized that I had in my hands

764
00:51:21,510 --> 00:51:24,262
the sort of stuff

765
00:51:24,430 --> 00:51:26,801
that sent the flower
of English manhood

766
00:51:26,974 --> 00:51:30,556
out into the world to create
an empire

767
00:51:30,726 --> 00:51:35,223
and might very well
create a little empire for me.

768
00:51:36,400 --> 00:51:38,891
My letters were simple and honest:

769
00:51:39,069 --> 00:51:43,019
"Dear lord so-and-so, if you do not
wish your child to know who you are,

770
00:51:43,198 --> 00:51:45,769
please send 1 pound a month.

771
00:51:45,950 --> 00:51:48,074
Sincerely..."

772
00:51:48,245 --> 00:51:52,159
He sent 1, and he sent 1.

773
00:51:52,331 --> 00:51:55,333
And so did lots of others.

774
00:51:57,461 --> 00:52:00,332
In fact, business was marvellous.

775
00:52:00,715 --> 00:52:02,173
Until one day,

776
00:52:02,342 --> 00:52:06,635
a nasty, dishonest child
stole my letters.

777
00:52:18,984 --> 00:52:21,224
To my joy and happiness,

778
00:52:21,402 --> 00:52:24,403
I was expelled.

779
00:52:25,531 --> 00:52:28,448
When I saw the glow
those pound notes brought

780
00:52:28,617 --> 00:52:30,112
to my dear mother's eyes,

781
00:52:30,285 --> 00:52:33,572
I made a firm resolution.

782
00:52:33,748 --> 00:52:35,289
"Melinda," I said,

783
00:52:35,458 --> 00:52:38,162
"let this be a lesson to you.

784
00:52:38,335 --> 00:52:43,625
Never, never do anything
except for money."

785
00:52:47,301 --> 00:52:51,216
But what about Robert Tentrees?

786
00:52:51,389 --> 00:52:53,513
He had no money
and you married him, didn't you?

787
00:52:54,392 --> 00:52:57,180
True, he had
not a penny to his name.

788
00:52:57,938 --> 00:53:01,805
But love is the exception
to every rule, is it not?

789
00:53:08,948 --> 00:53:10,656
You're crying.

790
00:53:18,165 --> 00:53:19,541
Why?

791
00:53:21,836 --> 00:53:24,541
I should have known
that one day he would desert me.

792
00:53:26,465 --> 00:53:27,841
Desert you?

793
00:53:29,719 --> 00:53:32,506
He was too weak to be faithful.

794
00:53:33,806 --> 00:53:36,380
Why didn't I see that?

795
00:53:36,685 --> 00:53:40,931
Is love so blind?

796
00:53:42,023 --> 00:53:43,434
No.

797
00:53:44,775 --> 00:53:47,562
But mistrust is so exhausting.

798
00:53:49,738 --> 00:53:52,858
It's not easy to be
a strong woman, Melinda.

799
00:53:53,909 --> 00:53:57,658
A man must be strong
for you to respect him,

800
00:53:58,038 --> 00:54:00,991
but weak for you to love him.

801
00:54:01,541 --> 00:54:03,250
And love makes the choice.

802
00:54:08,465 --> 00:54:10,753
That's very clever of you.

803
00:54:10,926 --> 00:54:12,966
Very clever.

804
00:54:15,221 --> 00:54:16,764
Who are you, exactly?

805
00:54:20,393 --> 00:54:21,722
I could ask the same of you.

806
00:54:22,479 --> 00:54:24,969
But you seem to know me
better than I know myself.

807
00:54:28,234 --> 00:54:30,144
That's because
I may have invented you.

808
00:54:31,904 --> 00:54:35,190
Now, what does that mean?

809
00:54:35,742 --> 00:54:37,948
Or don't you know either?

810
00:54:40,287 --> 00:54:42,031
Oh, dear.

811
00:54:42,999 --> 00:54:45,157
I'm suddenly a little...

812
00:54:45,917 --> 00:54:47,543
A little...

813
00:54:48,086 --> 00:54:50,376
Oh, boy, am I beat.

814
00:54:53,592 --> 00:54:55,170
You must be.

815
00:55:01,266 --> 00:55:03,424
What's the matter with me?

816
00:55:05,520 --> 00:55:07,810
There was never Melinda.

817
00:55:09,566 --> 00:55:12,022
Robert never existed.

818
00:55:12,945 --> 00:55:17,273
How could someone who never existed
desert someone who never lived?

819
00:55:22,913 --> 00:55:25,035
And when I heard it,

820
00:55:26,123 --> 00:55:28,793
why did it make me so sad?

821
00:55:31,380 --> 00:55:33,086
No.

822
00:55:33,339 --> 00:55:35,332
None of this is true.
None of it happened.

823
00:55:35,508 --> 00:55:38,213
It's nothing but shadows and
echoes of things that never were.

824
00:55:40,221 --> 00:55:47,055
This is a dream, Melinda

825
00:55:47,228 --> 00:55:53,895
Just a mirage, so they say

826
00:55:54,069 --> 00:55:58,565
This whole affair
They all declare

827
00:55:58,739 --> 00:56:05,241
Was dreamed each step of the way

828
00:56:05,412 --> 00:56:11,996
You're a mere dream, Melinda

829
00:56:12,169 --> 00:56:18,004
Out for a gay little spin

830
00:56:18,175 --> 00:56:22,920
Dealing me lies before my eyes

831
00:56:23,097 --> 00:56:28,257
Of days that never have been

832
00:56:29,686 --> 00:56:35,522
There's no Melinda

833
00:56:35,692 --> 00:56:41,065
They say for sure

834
00:56:41,239 --> 00:56:49,447
But don't go, Melinda

835
00:56:49,622 --> 00:56:54,617
I know and you know

836
00:56:54,795 --> 00:57:01,543
That you're no mere dream, Melinda

837
00:57:01,718 --> 00:57:08,170
Gone when the dawn
Glimmers through

838
00:57:08,349 --> 00:57:13,556
You and I know that long ago

839
00:57:13,729 --> 00:57:19,731
Before the dream there was you

840
00:57:21,069 --> 00:57:24,404
There

841
00:57:24,573 --> 00:57:29,033
Once

842
00:57:29,202 --> 00:57:34,410
Was you

843
00:57:45,051 --> 00:57:47,044
Damn you, Melinda.

844
00:57:47,220 --> 00:57:51,004
If I'm not on guard every moment,
you steal across the border into reality.

845
00:57:51,849 --> 00:57:53,724
There have been thousands
of cases like yours.

846
00:57:53,892 --> 00:57:55,388
And every one, without exception,

847
00:57:55,562 --> 00:57:58,562
has been traced
to something in the person's life.

848
00:57:58,731 --> 00:58:00,309
This life.

849
00:58:02,276 --> 00:58:05,278
Daisy Gamble, somewhere
in some closet of your mind

850
00:58:05,445 --> 00:58:09,193
is the key to all this.
And I intend to find it.

851
00:58:09,366 --> 00:58:14,158
If I have to squeeze out of you every
moment of your whole boring little life.

852
00:58:14,330 --> 00:58:16,038
So en garde.

853
00:58:28,969 --> 00:58:32,219
One, two, three.

854
00:58:33,640 --> 00:58:35,136
Hi.

855
00:58:35,768 --> 00:58:37,641
How do you feel?

856
00:58:37,811 --> 00:58:40,302
Fine. Did I do all right?

857
00:58:40,481 --> 00:58:42,058
I think so.

858
00:58:43,108 --> 00:58:46,311
How was the smoking
last night and today?

859
00:58:46,486 --> 00:58:48,776
Oh, much better. If the phone
hadn't rung this morning,

860
00:58:48,947 --> 00:58:51,437
I wouldn't have smoked
until breakfast.

861
00:58:51,908 --> 00:58:53,985
Do you always smoke
on the telephone?

862
00:58:55,328 --> 00:58:57,820
Well, you've got to.
I mean, you just got to.

863
00:58:57,998 --> 00:59:01,034
I mean, you got this hand
left over doing nothing.

864
00:59:01,209 --> 00:59:04,127
Of course, I usually hear it before
it rings and light up ahead of time.

865
00:59:04,797 --> 00:59:06,374
Of course.

866
00:59:06,672 --> 00:59:08,582
Where are you meeting Warren?

867
00:59:09,050 --> 00:59:10,959
At the Americana.

868
00:59:11,136 --> 00:59:13,129
Can I give you a lift?

869
00:59:13,889 --> 00:59:16,176
- Oh, thanks.
- Good.

870
00:59:26,650 --> 00:59:27,849
You know?

871
00:59:36,494 --> 00:59:37,691
Thank you.

872
00:59:38,078 --> 00:59:39,869
You're welcome.

873
00:59:40,205 --> 00:59:42,115
You sure I'm not gonna
take you out of your way?

874
00:59:42,291 --> 00:59:46,241
No, you're not. Not at all.
I'm going to the Metropolitan Museum.

875
00:59:46,420 --> 00:59:48,745
It's open tonight
and there's an exhibition

876
00:59:48,922 --> 00:59:51,592
of English painters
that I want to see.

877
00:59:51,759 --> 00:59:53,550
Oh, that's nice.

878
00:59:54,219 --> 00:59:57,470
England's had
some very good painters.

879
00:59:58,056 --> 01:00:01,591
I don't know much about it, really.
I mean, anything.

880
01:00:01,768 --> 01:00:03,393
Don't you like painting?

881
01:00:03,561 --> 01:00:06,931
I don't know.
I've gotten so used to wallpaper.

882
01:00:09,817 --> 01:00:15,193
But it's still much easier driving
over here than in England.

883
01:00:15,616 --> 01:00:19,031
In England, they drive on the left.

884
01:00:19,243 --> 01:00:21,949
Boy, those English sure have
a lot of guts.

885
01:00:22,121 --> 01:00:24,078
No, it's the law.

886
01:00:24,582 --> 01:00:27,702
- Haven't you ever been to England?
- Oh, no.

887
01:00:27,877 --> 01:00:30,415
The sea makes me seasick
and I'm afraid of flying.

888
01:00:30,589 --> 01:00:35,416
I mean, not really flying,
I'm afraid of the "no smoking" sign.

889
01:00:35,593 --> 01:00:38,759
- But maybe I can do it now, huh?
- I'm sure.

890
01:00:39,346 --> 01:00:41,386
Wouldn't you like a quick drink?
You have time.

891
01:00:41,557 --> 01:00:43,135
Oh, no, no. Thank you.
I don't think so.

892
01:00:43,309 --> 01:00:45,017
I'm supposed to be
at the Americana at...

893
01:00:45,186 --> 01:00:47,224
- A short one.
- Fine.

894
01:01:03,287 --> 01:01:06,204
And what are you studying?

895
01:01:06,707 --> 01:01:09,873
Well, let's see.

896
01:01:10,335 --> 01:01:14,748
Oh, I'm taking domestic science
at Laura Bates Greeley

897
01:01:14,965 --> 01:01:17,919
and budget-making
at Mary Hope Curtis

898
01:01:18,093 --> 01:01:21,675
and child care at the Sarah Plaut
Gromberg Clinic,

899
01:01:21,847 --> 01:01:23,507
you know, here
at the medical school.

900
01:01:23,682 --> 01:01:27,466
And 20 lectures on planned
parenthood, ten on how to

901
01:01:27,643 --> 01:01:29,222
and ten on how not to.

902
01:01:30,730 --> 01:01:33,351
What size family do you
come from?

903
01:01:33,815 --> 01:01:39,404
Well, my father's pretty fat,
but the rest of us is...

904
01:01:40,032 --> 01:01:43,944
Oh, you mean how many
brothers and sisters.

905
01:01:45,369 --> 01:01:46,650
None.

906
01:01:46,829 --> 01:01:50,079
I had this great stepbrother for a while,
but it didn't last very long.

907
01:01:50,249 --> 01:01:52,622
I mean, there was, you know,
trouble in the front office.

908
01:01:54,170 --> 01:01:56,541
You lived with your mother?

909
01:01:56,797 --> 01:01:59,799
Yeah. In Mahwah, New Jersey.

910
01:02:00,301 --> 01:02:04,629
- Where?
- Mahwah. M-A-H-W-A-H.

911
01:02:04,805 --> 01:02:07,676
That's where...
That's where she lives.

912
01:02:08,726 --> 01:02:11,680
- Fascinating.
- It is?

913
01:02:11,853 --> 01:02:15,638
- Another drink?
- Oh, no, no, no. Thank you, really.

914
01:02:15,817 --> 01:02:17,144
- I've gotta run.
- A short one.

915
01:02:17,318 --> 01:02:18,859
Oh, fine.

916
01:02:31,916 --> 01:02:34,322
- Muriel, have you seen Daisy?
- I thought she was with you.

917
01:02:34,500 --> 01:02:37,122
Oh, I goofed. Chemical Foods called
this afternoon and postponed

918
01:02:37,295 --> 01:02:39,703
and I forgot to call
and tell her.

919
01:02:40,507 --> 01:02:43,840
- Warren.
- Daisy, Daisy, I'm sorry.

920
01:02:44,010 --> 01:02:46,049
It was called off
and I forgot to tell you.

921
01:02:46,221 --> 01:02:49,008
- Did you wait too long?
- Oh, no.

922
01:02:49,181 --> 01:02:51,507
- But you got something to eat?
- Yeah.

923
01:02:51,684 --> 01:02:53,843
- Will you forgive me?
- Sure.

924
01:02:54,020 --> 01:02:56,476
- Thattagirl.
- I forgot too.

925
01:02:56,648 --> 01:02:59,185
- What?
- I didn't go,

926
01:02:59,358 --> 01:03:02,692
you know, to the Americana.
I forgot too.

927
01:03:02,863 --> 01:03:05,816
- You didn't go?
- No.

928
01:03:05,989 --> 01:03:07,982
Isn't that a funny coincidence?

929
01:03:08,159 --> 01:03:10,863
Yes, it certainly is. It's amazing.
You didn't go either.

930
01:03:11,037 --> 01:03:14,406
You... Didn't you really?

931
01:03:15,332 --> 01:03:18,204
No, I didn't. And I'm not just saying
that to make you feel good.

932
01:03:18,586 --> 01:03:22,665
Oh, I believe you. I believe you.
It's just that, well,

933
01:03:22,840 --> 01:03:26,256
Daisy, this was an important night,
and what the hell were you doing?

934
01:03:26,427 --> 01:03:28,834
What's the matter, Warren?
Everything worked out fine.

935
01:03:29,013 --> 01:03:32,428
- Aren't you happy?
- Yeah, I'm very happy.

936
01:03:32,600 --> 01:03:35,932
- Why don't you smile?
- I am.

937
01:03:36,519 --> 01:03:40,102
I like your smile, Warren. Super.
See you tomorrow.

938
01:03:40,274 --> 01:03:41,816
Look...

939
01:03:42,026 --> 01:03:46,069
- Daisy...
- Good night, Warren.

940
01:04:44,753 --> 01:04:47,422
Now, that's what I call a man.

941
01:04:48,256 --> 01:04:49,632
What are you gonna do
about Warren?

942
01:04:49,800 --> 01:04:52,290
That's the first time in my life
I felt like the opposite sex.

943
01:04:52,552 --> 01:04:54,177
What are you gonna do
about Warren?

944
01:04:54,345 --> 01:04:56,137
I wonder if he'll ask me
out tomorrow night.

945
01:04:56,473 --> 01:04:57,932
What are you gonna do
about Warren?

946
01:04:58,100 --> 01:05:01,468
What am I gonna do about Warren?
Oh, Warren doesn't care.

947
01:05:01,978 --> 01:05:05,098
- Warren cares.
- Warren cares.

948
01:05:05,274 --> 01:05:06,768
But I don't care.

949
01:05:06,984 --> 01:05:08,857
You have to care because
you're engaged to him.

950
01:05:09,026 --> 01:05:11,269
You don't have to care about him
because how do you know

951
01:05:11,446 --> 01:05:13,320
he cares about you?
Then what are you gonna do?

952
01:05:13,490 --> 01:05:14,864
What'd you say?

953
01:05:24,750 --> 01:05:29,876
When you know there's someone
Loving you

954
01:05:32,633 --> 01:05:37,545
And you know there's someone
You love too

955
01:05:40,182 --> 01:05:45,722
And they're not the same
What do you do?

956
01:05:48,023 --> 01:05:49,766
Go to sleep, girl

957
01:05:49,942 --> 01:05:53,191
Go to sleep
Go to sleep

958
01:05:55,322 --> 01:06:01,740
Close your eyes
And hide from every care

959
01:06:03,622 --> 01:06:09,494
When you wake up
They may not be there

960
01:06:10,253 --> 01:06:12,459
But tell me, how can I sleep?

961
01:06:12,631 --> 01:06:13,960
Tell me who could

962
01:06:14,132 --> 01:06:17,583
When you see your whole life
Tangled up good?

963
01:06:17,761 --> 01:06:20,333
I could drink
I could weep

964
01:06:20,513 --> 01:06:23,882
Oh, but how can I sleep?

965
01:06:25,309 --> 01:06:27,599
Go to sleep

966
01:06:29,105 --> 01:06:31,595
Go to sleep

967
01:06:34,109 --> 01:06:37,775
And when you and someone
Have a date

968
01:06:37,947 --> 01:06:41,446
Which you made
When you were thinking straight

969
01:06:41,617 --> 01:06:45,319
And when you and someone
Stay out late

970
01:06:45,496 --> 01:06:47,322
It was bad to

971
01:06:47,498 --> 01:06:49,371
But I had to

972
01:06:49,542 --> 01:06:53,242
When they're not the same
Who gets the gate?

973
01:06:53,421 --> 01:06:56,955
This is not the way to find a mate

974
01:06:57,132 --> 01:06:58,924
Go to sleep, girl

975
01:06:59,093 --> 01:07:01,216
Go to sleep
Go to sleep

976
01:07:01,387 --> 01:07:02,797
Go to sleep, girl

977
01:07:02,971 --> 01:07:04,845
Go to sleep
Go to sleep

978
01:07:05,015 --> 01:07:09,144
Comes the dawn
I may not feel the same

979
01:07:09,311 --> 01:07:12,477
Comes the dawn
He may not know your name

980
01:07:12,647 --> 01:07:17,688
In the sunlight
Who can see a flame?

981
01:07:19,237 --> 01:07:21,395
But tell me, how can I sleep?

982
01:07:21,572 --> 01:07:25,156
Look what I've done
Mess around with two men

983
01:07:25,326 --> 01:07:29,325
Soon you have none
As you sow, so you reap

984
01:07:29,497 --> 01:07:32,617
Which is why I can't sleep

985
01:07:34,335 --> 01:07:36,293
Go to sleep

986
01:07:38,131 --> 01:07:40,337
Go to sleep

987
01:07:42,051 --> 01:07:44,838
Go to sleep

988
01:07:45,764 --> 01:07:47,840
Go to...

989
01:07:51,227 --> 01:07:53,979
How do you happen to be in command
of all this useless knowledge?

990
01:07:54,188 --> 01:07:57,522
Because I'm interested
in extrasensory perception, ESP.

991
01:07:57,691 --> 01:08:00,693
What does it have to do
with ESP?

992
01:08:00,861 --> 01:08:03,612
Because if a case such as this

993
01:08:03,781 --> 01:08:06,698
is not the memory of a past life,

994
01:08:06,867 --> 01:08:09,275
then somehow...

995
01:08:10,038 --> 01:08:13,370
...knowledge is being acquired
by a sense

996
01:08:13,541 --> 01:08:18,535
other than the five that we know
about. Ergo, extrasensory.

997
01:08:18,712 --> 01:08:21,630
And, my boy, that's the solution
we'd better root for.

998
01:08:21,798 --> 01:08:24,550
Because if reincarnation is
ever proven,

999
01:08:24,719 --> 01:08:27,256
do you know who will be
the hardest hit?

1000
01:08:27,428 --> 01:08:30,465
The sweethearts of Sigmund Freud.

1001
01:08:30,641 --> 01:08:35,302
Did you ever look up Pelham and
Company or any of those ships?

1002
01:08:35,479 --> 01:08:37,886
This is a fantasy, Conrad.

1003
01:08:38,272 --> 01:08:41,892
To 600 million Muhammadans,
so is Christmas.

1004
01:08:42,819 --> 01:08:44,977
- Yes?
- Daisy Gamble is here, doctor.

1005
01:08:46,072 --> 01:08:47,401
May I meet her?

1006
01:08:48,075 --> 01:08:49,450
Ask her to come in.

1007
01:08:50,326 --> 01:08:54,371
Did you ever try to hypnotize
her by telepathy?

1008
01:08:54,539 --> 01:08:58,204
Oh, for God's sake, Conrad.
Telepathy.

1009
01:08:59,084 --> 01:09:02,619
- Hello, doctor.
- Hello.

1010
01:09:03,548 --> 01:09:04,746
I brought you these.

1011
01:09:04,924 --> 01:09:07,593
Miss Gamble, may I present
Dr Fuller.

1012
01:09:08,094 --> 01:09:09,552
Oh, hello.

1013
01:09:09,721 --> 01:09:12,970
How do you do, Miss Gamble?
I was just leaving.

1014
01:09:14,308 --> 01:09:16,135
They're geraniums.

1015
01:09:16,727 --> 01:09:18,850
Any minute now.

1016
01:09:19,021 --> 01:09:22,721
Miss Gamble says that she can make
flowers grow faster.

1017
01:09:22,900 --> 01:09:25,225
Faster than what, Miss Gamble?

1018
01:09:25,444 --> 01:09:28,729
Well, you know, faster.

1019
01:09:29,364 --> 01:09:32,282
What I mean, my friend Muriel and I,
we plant our seeds on the same day,

1020
01:09:32,451 --> 01:09:35,322
and, I don't know, my flowers come
charging out of the pot

1021
01:09:35,496 --> 01:09:38,449
as if the police were after them,
and poor Muriel...

1022
01:09:38,624 --> 01:09:41,494
Do you ever talk to your flowers,
Miss Gamble?

1023
01:09:41,668 --> 01:09:44,704
Talk to them?
What do you think I am, crazy?

1024
01:09:44,880 --> 01:09:46,457
Do you?

1025
01:09:47,090 --> 01:09:49,048
- You don't think I should?
- Yes, I do,

1026
01:09:49,301 --> 01:09:51,970
and don't let anyone stop you, either.

1027
01:09:52,720 --> 01:09:55,638
Well, goodbye, Miss Gamble.

1028
01:09:56,975 --> 01:10:02,217
Oh, Marc, I advise you to check
those names.

1029
01:10:06,276 --> 01:10:08,766
I brought these for your window.

1030
01:10:10,236 --> 01:10:12,480
- You know, sill?
- Thank you.

1031
01:10:12,657 --> 01:10:14,814
Let's put them over here.

1032
01:10:19,330 --> 01:10:20,990
Doctor,

1033
01:10:21,415 --> 01:10:25,577
were you thinking about me
around 4:00 this morning?

1034
01:10:25,752 --> 01:10:27,746
I was asleep then, Miss Gamble.
Why?

1035
01:10:27,922 --> 01:10:31,670
So was I, but something woke me up.
I could've sworn it was you.

1036
01:10:32,092 --> 01:10:34,334
Really?

1037
01:10:34,512 --> 01:10:38,972
Those look just great there.
Gotta bring you some more.

1038
01:10:39,141 --> 01:10:40,931
Miss Gamble.

1039
01:10:42,103 --> 01:10:45,934
I wonder if I could hypnotize
you by...

1040
01:10:46,940 --> 01:10:48,849
...telepathy.

1041
01:10:50,778 --> 01:10:52,983
What would I have to do?

1042
01:10:53,530 --> 01:10:55,653
Just sit here...

1043
01:10:57,325 --> 01:11:01,702
...perfectly still, and empty
your mind of all thought.

1044
01:11:02,080 --> 01:11:05,532
And I'll stand over here,
and at a certain moment,

1045
01:11:05,708 --> 01:11:08,282
I'll begin hypnotizing you
in my mind.

1046
01:11:08,461 --> 01:11:10,204
Do you understand?

1047
01:11:10,380 --> 01:11:15,042
Sure, I understand.
It's such a ridiculous...

1048
01:11:26,562 --> 01:11:31,224
Very good, Miss Gamble.
And very irritating.

1049
01:11:36,322 --> 01:11:38,777
About Melinda Tentrees,
you told me

1050
01:11:38,949 --> 01:11:41,072
that your husband Robert
deserted you.

1051
01:11:41,243 --> 01:11:45,621
Please. Not when I'm about
to make an entrance.

1052
01:11:53,713 --> 01:11:55,374
Number four.

1053
01:11:55,548 --> 01:11:57,505
Black.

1054
01:12:10,021 --> 01:12:14,102
Melinda, my dear.
What a questionable surprise.

1055
01:12:14,609 --> 01:12:17,526
Do sit down, if you insist.

1056
01:12:22,408 --> 01:12:23,868
Thank you.

1057
01:12:24,035 --> 01:12:26,905
It's quite fascinating. I cannot lose.

1058
01:12:27,080 --> 01:12:28,953
If I win, I win.

1059
01:12:29,124 --> 01:12:32,123
If I lose, you'll be in agony,
and I win.

1060
01:12:32,293 --> 01:12:35,128
Number ten. Black.

1061
01:12:36,756 --> 01:12:38,963
Well, you have lost.

1062
01:12:39,133 --> 01:12:41,458
And I am hardly writhing
on the floor.

1063
01:12:41,636 --> 01:12:43,130
Ladies and gentlemen,
place your bets.

1064
01:12:43,304 --> 01:12:45,463
And unlike you,

1065
01:12:45,640 --> 01:12:48,474
I know what it is to be poor.

1066
01:12:49,352 --> 01:12:52,970
All you have ever been
is without funds.

1067
01:12:53,189 --> 01:12:57,650
You're so smug about your humble
beginnings, aren't you? You bore me.

1068
01:12:57,818 --> 01:12:59,063
Rien ne va plus.

1069
01:12:59,236 --> 01:13:01,644
That is not true.

1070
01:13:01,989 --> 01:13:05,738
You may resent me, Robert.

1071
01:13:06,493 --> 01:13:08,237
But you are not bored.

1072
01:13:08,412 --> 01:13:10,487
Number 19.

1073
01:13:10,664 --> 01:13:13,534
Red.

1074
01:13:20,298 --> 01:13:22,624
Play 24.

1075
01:13:27,513 --> 01:13:30,349
I've lost everything, what?

1076
01:13:30,642 --> 01:13:32,848
- Everything.
- Splendid.

1077
01:13:33,020 --> 01:13:35,854
I don't wish to be rich,
I don't wish to be knighted

1078
01:13:36,022 --> 01:13:39,356
and I don't wish to be married.

1079
01:13:39,943 --> 01:13:41,187
You lie.

1080
01:13:41,360 --> 01:13:45,275
Number 24. Black.

1081
01:13:51,120 --> 01:13:54,572
Yes. I lie.

1082
01:13:55,291 --> 01:13:59,953
Do you enjoy lying?

1083
01:14:00,129 --> 01:14:03,130
To you and with you.

1084
01:14:03,633 --> 01:14:06,040
Ladies and gentlemen,
place your bets.

1085
01:14:06,218 --> 01:14:10,050
Play 36.

1086
01:14:15,394 --> 01:14:17,102
Rien ne va plus.

1087
01:14:20,523 --> 01:14:22,896
Must you have everything?

1088
01:14:23,069 --> 01:14:25,986
Man cannot live by bed alone.

1089
01:14:26,154 --> 01:14:29,653
Number 36. Red.

1090
01:14:41,962 --> 01:14:44,962
Good Lord, what does she
see in him?

1091
01:14:45,131 --> 01:14:47,456
That gigolo.

1092
01:14:48,092 --> 01:14:51,258
What a strange creature woman is.

1093
01:14:51,429 --> 01:14:53,920
Does kindness, generosity
and devotion

1094
01:14:54,099 --> 01:14:58,843
fill her with kindness, generosity
and devotion?

1095
01:14:59,979 --> 01:15:03,099
But give her a good-for-nothing rat
who pinches her money

1096
01:15:03,274 --> 01:15:08,648
and every girl in town,
and she'll turn into an angel of love.

1097
01:15:08,821 --> 01:15:13,447
Oh, God, why didn't you make
woman first, when you were fresh?

1098
01:15:21,709 --> 01:15:24,709
"Robert: Must you have everything?

1099
01:15:24,879 --> 01:15:27,879
Melinda: Man cannot live
by bed alone."

1100
01:15:28,383 --> 01:15:30,789
"Doctor: Now may we go on?

1101
01:15:30,967 --> 01:15:34,669
Patient: I am quite tired.

1102
01:15:34,846 --> 01:15:38,132
Doctor: I can see you are.

1103
01:15:38,308 --> 01:15:42,472
You may sleep until..."
Et cetera, et cetera, et cetera.

1104
01:15:45,231 --> 01:15:47,307
This is the case to date.

1105
01:15:48,652 --> 01:15:50,941
Now I want to see
by a show of hands

1106
01:15:51,113 --> 01:15:54,730
how many of you think it's
a psychological fantasy?

1107
01:15:58,536 --> 01:16:00,279
Everybody.

1108
01:16:00,955 --> 01:16:05,000
There's no question about it.
No argument.

1109
01:16:05,168 --> 01:16:07,837
And no evidence.

1110
01:16:08,170 --> 01:16:09,997
Only prejudice.

1111
01:16:12,842 --> 01:16:18,084
In my opinion, this case merits
further investigation.

1112
01:16:18,264 --> 01:16:24,516
And I intend to go on searching
the patient's life and mind for a clue.

1113
01:16:25,104 --> 01:16:29,149
In addition, the information about
England must also be checked.

1114
01:16:29,317 --> 01:16:34,192
If any of you have the time or interest,
I would welcome your help.

1115
01:16:36,282 --> 01:16:41,193
And the expected high for today
will be 72 degrees.

1116
01:16:41,370 --> 01:16:44,953
The time is now 16 minutes past 8.

1117
01:16:45,124 --> 01:16:47,994
On the local front,
a nasty case of mysticism

1118
01:16:48,168 --> 01:16:50,576
has struck
the Stuyvesant Medical School.

1119
01:16:50,754 --> 01:16:53,873
Yesterday Dr Marc Chabot,
professor of psychiatry,

1120
01:16:54,049 --> 01:16:56,374
let it be known
that he was investigating

1121
01:16:56,552 --> 01:16:59,090
a possible case of reincarnation.

1122
01:16:59,263 --> 01:17:01,587
And by dawn, the school
was surrounded.

1123
01:17:01,765 --> 01:17:04,551
Countless students, seeking
a fresh cause for rebellion,

1124
01:17:04,726 --> 01:17:08,474
congregated in front of the medical
school demanding academic freedom.

1125
01:17:08,646 --> 01:17:11,138
An emergency meeting of
the Stuyvesant board of directors

1126
01:17:11,316 --> 01:17:13,522
was called for this morning.

1127
01:17:13,693 --> 01:17:16,266
I want those junkies out of the yard.

1128
01:17:16,446 --> 01:17:18,522
We'll get them out, Brad.

1129
01:17:18,698 --> 01:17:21,320
Marc, we were told that yesterday
in your lecture hall,

1130
01:17:21,660 --> 01:17:25,277
you read aloud a case history
of one of your current patients,

1131
01:17:25,455 --> 01:17:27,447
and in the discussions
that followed,

1132
01:17:27,624 --> 01:17:33,080
you indicated that one possible
explanation...

1133
01:17:33,295 --> 01:17:36,630
You'll have to forgive me, Marc,
but this is what we heard.

1134
01:17:36,799 --> 01:17:41,876
One possible explanation
could be reincarnation.

1135
01:17:43,055 --> 01:17:47,053
Now, what actually happened, Marc?

1136
01:17:47,893 --> 01:17:49,886
That's what happened.

1137
01:17:50,271 --> 01:17:53,770
What the hell did you say that for?

1138
01:17:53,941 --> 01:17:57,274
- Because it could be.
- It could be.

1139
01:17:57,444 --> 01:18:00,280
But the point is it isn't.

1140
01:18:00,447 --> 01:18:02,404
The stink's coming right
through the walls.

1141
01:18:02,574 --> 01:18:04,282
We know, Brad.

1142
01:18:04,450 --> 01:18:07,452
Get them out of here before they
start setting themselves on fire.

1143
01:18:07,621 --> 01:18:08,901
We will, Brad!

1144
01:18:09,248 --> 01:18:12,866
This medical school is
a damn sick little guy.

1145
01:18:13,043 --> 01:18:17,620
The only way you're gonna be able
to get rid of the poison is surgery.

1146
01:18:17,797 --> 01:18:20,964
We've gotta go deep
with that scalpel.

1147
01:18:21,133 --> 01:18:23,708
I'm presiding here, Crock.

1148
01:18:23,887 --> 01:18:25,760
You might try to remember
how difficult it is

1149
01:18:25,930 --> 01:18:28,717
to get good college presidents
these days.

1150
01:18:28,892 --> 01:18:31,643
Gentlemen, I think we can cut
through all of this.

1151
01:18:32,729 --> 01:18:36,427
Marc, in a privately sponsored school,
such as Stuyvesant,

1152
01:18:36,607 --> 01:18:40,521
academic freedom means that if you
disagree with the administration,

1153
01:18:40,694 --> 01:18:44,110
you're free to go to
another academy.

1154
01:18:44,448 --> 01:18:48,149
That's a choice that you're
going to have to make.

1155
01:18:49,495 --> 01:18:52,828
At 10:00 tomorrow morning,
I want you to bring into my office

1156
01:18:52,999 --> 01:18:54,742
either a letter denying emphatically

1157
01:18:54,917 --> 01:18:57,668
that your remarks had
any mystic implications

1158
01:18:57,837 --> 01:19:00,125
or a letter of resignation.

1159
01:19:00,673 --> 01:19:02,665
Is that clear?

1160
01:19:04,050 --> 01:19:07,634
Mason, I don't see how you could ask
me to do anything else.

1161
01:19:07,804 --> 01:19:11,671
We have got to stop this kind
of publicity.

1162
01:19:12,517 --> 01:19:14,095
Good day, gentlemen.

1163
01:19:14,519 --> 01:19:20,225
And it was never my intention

1164
01:19:20,400 --> 01:19:24,066
to suggest reincarnation

1165
01:19:24,237 --> 01:19:28,780
as a possible solution

1166
01:19:29,367 --> 01:19:32,701
to this case.

1167
01:19:34,831 --> 01:19:38,829
I only wanted my students

1168
01:19:39,002 --> 01:19:44,340
to learn that all possibilities

1169
01:19:44,715 --> 01:19:47,385
must always...

1170
01:19:59,063 --> 01:20:00,806
Are you all right, doctor?

1171
01:20:00,982 --> 01:20:02,809
Yes, come in, come in.

1172
01:20:02,983 --> 01:20:05,734
All those things they said about
you in the paper, I was so worried.

1173
01:20:05,903 --> 01:20:06,934
- Come in.
- I mean, how is

1174
01:20:07,112 --> 01:20:09,271
- your mental health, doctor?
- It's fine, thank you.

1175
01:20:09,448 --> 01:20:11,406
Oh, you're welcome.

1176
01:20:11,575 --> 01:20:15,074
Boy, what a layout.

1177
01:20:16,413 --> 01:20:19,830
Gee, this is really something.

1178
01:20:20,667 --> 01:20:22,410
Who's that?

1179
01:20:22,586 --> 01:20:24,378
The woman who lives here.

1180
01:20:26,256 --> 01:20:29,839
- Oh, I thought you lived here.
- I do.

1181
01:20:30,510 --> 01:20:32,135
Where is she now?

1182
01:20:32,638 --> 01:20:36,469
Away with her husband.

1183
01:20:36,641 --> 01:20:40,011
- Are they French too?
- No. No.

1184
01:20:40,186 --> 01:20:42,310
They gave me their apartment
for the summer.

1185
01:20:45,358 --> 01:20:47,731
You sure you're all right?

1186
01:20:48,278 --> 01:20:49,476
Yes.

1187
01:20:50,447 --> 01:20:55,025
Doctor, how long has this stuff
been going on?

1188
01:20:55,201 --> 01:20:56,530
Quite a while.

1189
01:20:56,703 --> 01:20:59,109
Does anybody besides you know
who the thing is happening to?

1190
01:20:59,288 --> 01:21:02,658
- I mean, you know, who the nut is?
- No.

1191
01:21:02,834 --> 01:21:04,292
And no one ever will.

1192
01:21:06,044 --> 01:21:09,295
Do most people think it was
a man or a woman?

1193
01:21:09,465 --> 01:21:14,007
Yes, most people think it was
a man or a woman.

1194
01:21:21,810 --> 01:21:25,309
Daisy, would you mind if we skipped
your session tonight?

1195
01:21:27,983 --> 01:21:29,311
That's all right.

1196
01:21:29,818 --> 01:21:31,478
But we can still have dinner
if you like.

1197
01:21:31,820 --> 01:21:34,394
Oh, great! And will you let me
pick out where?

1198
01:21:34,865 --> 01:21:36,608
Of course.

1199
01:21:36,783 --> 01:21:39,155
Nobody ever asks me where
I wanna go except you.

1200
01:21:39,328 --> 01:21:42,613
I mean, everybody usually,
you know, always tells me.

1201
01:21:42,790 --> 01:21:46,158
I'm kind of a...
You know, a go-alonger.

1202
01:21:46,334 --> 01:21:50,083
I mean, people say "Come along,"
and I go along.

1203
01:21:51,132 --> 01:21:54,713
Downstairs where I live,
they've got

1204
01:21:54,884 --> 01:21:57,423
this restaurant called
Enrico and Bernardi's.

1205
01:21:57,595 --> 01:21:59,837
But, well, I mean,
does anybody ever say:

1206
01:22:00,014 --> 01:22:03,597
"Daisy, do you wanna go
to Enrico and Bernardi's?"

1207
01:22:03,768 --> 01:22:05,677
No. No, they say:

1208
01:22:05,854 --> 01:22:08,344
"Daisy, we are going
to Enrico and Bernardi's.

1209
01:22:08,523 --> 01:22:10,895
You want to come along?"
So I go along.

1210
01:22:11,693 --> 01:22:13,317
I don't even like
Enrico and Bernardi's.

1211
01:22:13,486 --> 01:22:15,063
They've got absolutely rotten food.

1212
01:22:15,404 --> 01:22:20,530
And the pizza, well, I have lost
more temporary fillings...

1213
01:22:54,400 --> 01:22:56,227
Hello.

1214
01:22:59,739 --> 01:23:01,150
Oh, it's you.

1215
01:23:02,075 --> 01:23:03,485
How are you tonight?

1216
01:23:03,660 --> 01:23:06,068
I am accused of treason.

1217
01:23:06,246 --> 01:23:08,452
And tomorrow I shall be ordered
to stand trial.

1218
01:23:10,584 --> 01:23:12,908
Does Robert know?

1219
01:23:13,336 --> 01:23:15,294
I sent him a message two hours ago.

1220
01:23:17,340 --> 01:23:18,965
Where is he?

1221
01:23:19,842 --> 01:23:21,965
He should be home soon.

1222
01:23:22,804 --> 01:23:26,552
Could this be the moment
he deserted you?

1223
01:23:27,058 --> 01:23:29,015
Deserted me?

1224
01:23:29,185 --> 01:23:32,933
Robert has not deserted me,
and he never will.

1225
01:23:33,105 --> 01:23:34,932
You ought to know.

1226
01:23:35,107 --> 01:23:36,768
Why?

1227
01:23:37,444 --> 01:23:40,278
Do you think I can see
into the future?

1228
01:23:40,779 --> 01:23:42,606
Yes.

1229
01:23:43,574 --> 01:23:46,244
I can about certain things.

1230
01:23:46,410 --> 01:23:49,779
But never, never about myself.

1231
01:23:56,878 --> 01:24:00,165
Oh, I am pleased you came tonight.

1232
01:24:01,675 --> 01:24:05,091
An hour ago I was ready to leap
from the bridge.

1233
01:24:11,726 --> 01:24:13,803
What's the matter?

1234
01:24:14,980 --> 01:24:17,814
Melinda, I came to say goodbye.

1235
01:24:19,317 --> 01:24:21,642
Goodbye?

1236
01:24:22,863 --> 01:24:25,862
We shan't be together ever again?

1237
01:24:26,741 --> 01:24:28,699
No.

1238
01:24:30,703 --> 01:24:32,993
That's dreadful.

1239
01:24:34,249 --> 01:24:35,992
I shall miss you.

1240
01:24:37,836 --> 01:24:40,124
I shall miss you too.

1241
01:24:41,046 --> 01:24:45,508
You have brought something
into my life I never knew existed.

1242
01:24:45,676 --> 01:24:47,752
What's that?

1243
01:24:48,428 --> 01:24:49,674
Mystery.

1244
01:24:51,306 --> 01:24:53,466
How odd.

1245
01:24:53,893 --> 01:24:57,059
You have brought clarity
into mine.

1246
01:24:58,188 --> 01:25:00,062
What will I ever do without you?

1247
01:25:01,442 --> 01:25:04,192
- You have Robert.
- I know.

1248
01:25:06,822 --> 01:25:08,613
Whom you love.

1249
01:25:08,783 --> 01:25:10,822
I know.

1250
01:25:11,618 --> 01:25:13,943
But he isn't you.

1251
01:25:17,208 --> 01:25:20,124
How could I be

1252
01:25:20,294 --> 01:25:23,579
This at ease with him?

1253
01:25:24,590 --> 01:25:29,880
Pour out my heart
As I please with him?

1254
01:25:31,054 --> 01:25:35,383
He isn't you

1255
01:25:36,351 --> 01:25:39,851
He isn't you

1256
01:25:41,190 --> 01:25:46,064
When will I feel
So in bloom again?

1257
01:25:46,236 --> 01:25:52,487
When will a voice
Warm the room again?

1258
01:25:52,658 --> 01:25:56,407
He isn't you

1259
01:25:56,580 --> 01:26:00,743
He isn't you

1260
01:26:00,916 --> 01:26:03,242
Memories may fade

1261
01:26:03,419 --> 01:26:09,837
In the shadows behind me

1262
01:26:10,759 --> 01:26:13,760
But there'll be the dream

1263
01:26:13,928 --> 01:26:20,098
That will always remind me

1264
01:26:20,270 --> 01:26:22,307
A dream

1265
01:26:22,479 --> 01:26:26,347
That I'll be forever

1266
01:26:26,526 --> 01:26:32,943
Comparing him to

1267
01:26:33,282 --> 01:26:37,445
So love me, he may

1268
01:26:37,618 --> 01:26:40,324
Even die for me

1269
01:26:40,497 --> 01:26:44,114
Sweep every cloud

1270
01:26:44,292 --> 01:26:47,626
From the sky for me

1271
01:26:47,796 --> 01:26:51,128
He may be king

1272
01:26:51,299 --> 01:26:54,300
But he'll never

1273
01:26:54,469 --> 01:27:00,886
Be you

1274
01:27:17,867 --> 01:27:22,160
But why must you turn back
into a caterpillar, Melinda?

1275
01:27:22,913 --> 01:27:26,993
How did you ever become
this little nothing of a creature?

1276
01:27:28,377 --> 01:27:32,540
Oh, sometimes I think
if I hear another "I mean,"

1277
01:27:32,714 --> 01:27:36,000
I will tighten my tie until I strangle.

1278
01:27:55,904 --> 01:27:56,983
Marc, sit down.

1279
01:28:05,330 --> 01:28:09,707
Mason, you asked me yesterday
to prepare a statement.

1280
01:28:10,209 --> 01:28:13,459
Forgive me, Marc. Could we
table that for a moment?

1281
01:28:14,547 --> 01:28:18,331
- Why?
- Just bear with me.

1282
01:28:18,634 --> 01:28:21,636
Marc, you know this building
is called Stratton Hall.

1283
01:28:21,804 --> 01:28:24,129
Do you know who
Cleo Stratton is?

1284
01:28:24,306 --> 01:28:26,928
The man who owns
that enormous yacht in the river?

1285
01:28:27,101 --> 01:28:30,221
He lives on it.
He's now 80.

1286
01:28:30,396 --> 01:28:35,104
During the past 25 years he's
had diabetes, tuberculosis,

1287
01:28:35,276 --> 01:28:38,111
cataracts, half dozen
assorted tumours,

1288
01:28:38,611 --> 01:28:40,604
ulcers, gallstones
and water on the knee,

1289
01:28:40,781 --> 01:28:44,197
all of which the doctors here
at Stuyvesant have cured.

1290
01:28:44,785 --> 01:28:47,275
Coincidentally,
during this same period,

1291
01:28:47,454 --> 01:28:50,954
he has given the school
over $20 million,

1292
01:28:51,542 --> 01:28:55,669
including his Social Security
and Medicare checks.

1293
01:28:56,546 --> 01:28:59,713
Mr Stratton heard about
our conversation yesterday

1294
01:28:59,883 --> 01:29:03,252
and called me early this morning
to inform me

1295
01:29:03,428 --> 01:29:05,466
he was definitely in favour
of your being allowed

1296
01:29:05,639 --> 01:29:07,596
to continue with your case.

1297
01:29:08,141 --> 01:29:09,849
With the four of us against it,

1298
01:29:10,018 --> 01:29:16,436
it made the final vote ten for you
and none opposed.

1299
01:29:17,900 --> 01:29:21,187
He not only wants you to continue
with your case,

1300
01:29:21,362 --> 01:29:25,905
but he wants me to organize
a permanent department

1301
01:29:26,075 --> 01:29:28,482
for research into reincarnation.

1302
01:29:29,913 --> 01:29:31,407
Good Lord.

1303
01:29:32,415 --> 01:29:34,787
Yes, I believe he is.

1304
01:29:35,417 --> 01:29:37,873
But Mr Stratton wants proof.

1305
01:29:38,046 --> 01:29:42,506
It occurred to him that if it's possible
to identify one's previous incarnations,

1306
01:29:42,674 --> 01:29:47,585
it might also be possible to determine
one's future ones,

1307
01:29:48,055 --> 01:29:51,887
in which case Mr Stratton
could leave his money to himself.

1308
01:29:52,476 --> 01:29:55,347
You mean, if he can't take it with him,
he'll come back and get it?

1309
01:29:56,188 --> 01:29:57,896
Yes.

1310
01:29:58,064 --> 01:30:00,687
Well, what do you think, Marc?

1311
01:30:00,859 --> 01:30:04,358
Well, what do you expect?
It's the chance of a lifetime,

1312
01:30:04,529 --> 01:30:06,606
of all my lifetimes.

1313
01:30:06,780 --> 01:30:08,656
Thank you.

1314
01:30:09,159 --> 01:30:12,610
I will so inform him.

1315
01:30:14,831 --> 01:30:16,741
You're...

1316
01:30:18,168 --> 01:30:20,457
You're not happy about it,
are you, Mason?

1317
01:30:20,628 --> 01:30:24,413
No, I'm not happy.
I think reincarnation is appalling.

1318
01:30:24,591 --> 01:30:27,508
It kills ambition,
perpetuates human misery

1319
01:30:27,677 --> 01:30:29,835
and propagates false hopes.

1320
01:30:30,013 --> 01:30:32,301
And is obviously a pack of lies.

1321
01:30:32,474 --> 01:30:35,343
Then how can you accept
his proposition?

1322
01:30:36,810 --> 01:30:38,850
I may be wrong.

1323
01:30:39,522 --> 01:30:41,847
Dr Chabot's office.

1324
01:30:42,024 --> 01:30:44,479
Oh, yes. Yes, doctor, she's here.

1325
01:30:44,652 --> 01:30:45,933
One moment, please.

1326
01:30:46,112 --> 01:30:49,278
The doctor will be a little late.
Can you wait?

1327
01:30:49,448 --> 01:30:51,240
Yes, she can.

1328
01:30:51,408 --> 01:30:55,489
Oh, then I can go home now?
Thank you, doctor. Good night.

1329
01:30:55,664 --> 01:30:57,820
You don't mind being alone, do you?
He won't be long.

1330
01:30:57,998 --> 01:30:59,706
Oh, no, don't worry about me.

1331
01:30:59,876 --> 01:31:04,040
I wanna listen to the news, you know,
about him, if there is any.

1332
01:31:04,212 --> 01:31:06,918
- Good night.
- Good night.

1333
01:31:35,034 --> 01:31:37,704
I'm Daisy Gamble.

1334
01:31:37,871 --> 01:31:41,074
Maybe I was called
something else once,

1335
01:31:41,249 --> 01:31:46,041
but the only name I...

1336
01:31:46,213 --> 01:31:48,205
Take your time.

1337
01:31:49,424 --> 01:31:54,714
I mean, my name has always...

1338
01:31:56,431 --> 01:31:58,387
My name is...

1339
01:31:59,766 --> 01:32:03,468
My name is Melinda.

1340
01:32:03,647 --> 01:32:09,981
Melinda Winifred Waine Tentrees.

1341
01:32:10,653 --> 01:32:20,072
And I am appalled and stunned
at this outrageous inquisition.

1342
01:32:41,767 --> 01:32:44,436
You may sleep until I count to three
and snap my fingers,

1343
01:32:44,602 --> 01:32:49,763
and then you will awake
and remember nothing about Melinda.

1344
01:32:49,941 --> 01:32:52,098
Now, sleep.

1345
01:32:52,276 --> 01:32:57,105
But why must you turn back
into a caterpillar, Melinda?

1346
01:32:57,281 --> 01:33:01,529
How did you ever become
this little nothing of a creature?

1347
01:33:01,702 --> 01:33:05,866
Oh, sometimes I think if I hear
another "I mean,"

1348
01:33:06,040 --> 01:33:09,658
I will tighten my tie until I strangle.

1349
01:33:10,210 --> 01:33:12,702
Daisy Gamble,
somewhere in your mind

1350
01:33:12,880 --> 01:33:16,046
is the key to all this,
and I intend to find it,

1351
01:33:16,217 --> 01:33:20,677
if I have to squeeze out of you every
moment of your whole boring little...

1352
01:33:43,994 --> 01:33:46,484
I don't know why

1353
01:33:47,080 --> 01:33:51,659
They redesigned me

1354
01:33:52,878 --> 01:33:55,368
He likes the way

1355
01:33:56,298 --> 01:33:59,667
He used to find me

1356
01:34:00,427 --> 01:34:03,213
He likes the girl

1357
01:34:03,638 --> 01:34:07,506
I left behind me

1358
01:34:07,976 --> 01:34:10,597
I mean, he...

1359
01:34:10,770 --> 01:34:13,522
I mean, me...

1360
01:34:22,907 --> 01:34:24,946
What did I have

1361
01:34:27,661 --> 01:34:29,904
That I don't have?

1362
01:34:31,706 --> 01:34:33,746
What did he like

1363
01:34:35,753 --> 01:34:38,422
That I lost track of?

1364
01:34:40,048 --> 01:34:42,088
What did I do

1365
01:34:42,259 --> 01:34:45,593
That I don't do

1366
01:34:45,763 --> 01:34:53,260
The way I did before?

1367
01:34:54,771 --> 01:34:57,263
What isn't there

1368
01:34:58,273 --> 01:35:01,940
That once was there?

1369
01:35:02,445 --> 01:35:04,188
What have I got

1370
01:35:04,364 --> 01:35:08,825
A great big lack of?

1371
01:35:08,994 --> 01:35:11,863
Something in me then

1372
01:35:12,038 --> 01:35:16,617
He could see then

1373
01:35:17,793 --> 01:35:22,789
Beckons to him no more

1374
01:35:22,966 --> 01:35:29,799
I'm just a victim of time

1375
01:35:29,972 --> 01:35:34,433
Obsolete in my prime

1376
01:35:34,602 --> 01:35:38,600
Out-of-date and outclassed

1377
01:35:40,150 --> 01:35:42,687
By my past

1378
01:35:44,570 --> 01:35:46,978
What did he love

1379
01:35:48,156 --> 01:35:52,155
That there's none of?

1380
01:35:52,327 --> 01:35:54,035
What did I lose

1381
01:35:54,205 --> 01:35:59,245
The sweet, warm knack of?

1382
01:35:59,835 --> 01:36:01,626
Wouldn't I be

1383
01:36:01,796 --> 01:36:04,203
The late, great me

1384
01:36:04,381 --> 01:36:10,336
If I knew how?

1385
01:36:12,597 --> 01:36:15,681
What did I have

1386
01:36:15,851 --> 01:36:19,183
I don't

1387
01:36:20,396 --> 01:36:29,815
Have now?

1388
01:36:48,049 --> 01:36:50,800
I thought he kind of liked me.

1389
01:36:53,096 --> 01:36:56,631
And all the time he was thinking
of someone else.

1390
01:36:57,766 --> 01:36:59,474
Me.

1391
01:37:00,893 --> 01:37:03,220
Those questions.

1392
01:37:04,190 --> 01:37:06,478
He wasn't interested in me.

1393
01:37:06,650 --> 01:37:09,568
He was interested in me.

1394
01:37:10,613 --> 01:37:12,901
Oh, God.

1395
01:37:14,074 --> 01:37:16,779
Why did I have to come along?

1396
01:37:17,744 --> 01:37:21,030
I mean, what is so special
about an English accent?

1397
01:37:28,838 --> 01:37:30,796
Cheerio.

1398
01:37:32,760 --> 01:37:34,716
Tallyho, doctor.

1399
01:37:34,887 --> 01:37:37,757
Yes, she gave me the jolly message.

1400
01:37:37,930 --> 01:37:40,138
Oh, nothing. Nothing is wrong.

1401
01:37:40,308 --> 01:37:41,802
After all, what is time?

1402
01:37:41,977 --> 01:37:45,843
If you miss me in this life, you can
catch me in the next, can't one?

1403
01:37:46,022 --> 01:37:47,053
Eh, what?

1404
01:37:47,232 --> 01:37:49,557
Well, kippered herring!

1405
01:37:50,194 --> 01:37:52,944
What did I have that I don't have?

1406
01:37:53,112 --> 01:37:55,983
What do I need a big supply of?

1407
01:37:56,157 --> 01:38:02,276
What was the trick I did
Particularly well before?

1408
01:38:02,455 --> 01:38:05,409
What did he see that's gone in me?

1409
01:38:05,584 --> 01:38:08,370
What did I use that now I'm shy of?

1410
01:38:08,544 --> 01:38:11,498
Why is the sequel never the equal?

1411
01:38:11,672 --> 01:38:14,589
Why is there no encore?

1412
01:38:14,758 --> 01:38:19,800
Where can I go to repair

1413
01:38:19,972 --> 01:38:22,925
All the wear and the tear

1414
01:38:23,100 --> 01:38:27,513
Till I'm once again the previous me?

1415
01:38:27,688 --> 01:38:30,724
What did he like that I am not like?

1416
01:38:30,899 --> 01:38:33,983
What was the charm
That I've run dry of?

1417
01:38:34,153 --> 01:38:35,267
What would I give

1418
01:38:35,445 --> 01:38:39,822
If my old know-how
Still knew how?

1419
01:38:39,991 --> 01:38:42,863
Oh, what did I know?

1420
01:38:43,036 --> 01:38:46,202
Tell me, where did it go?

1421
01:38:46,373 --> 01:38:51,616
What, oh, what did I have

1422
01:38:55,423 --> 01:39:00,844
I don't

1423
01:39:01,012 --> 01:39:04,844
Have

1424
01:39:11,021 --> 01:39:16,312
Now?

1425
01:39:31,333 --> 01:39:32,993
Daisy!

1426
01:39:36,129 --> 01:39:39,628
What did you mean, "the next life"?
What were you talking about?

1427
01:39:39,800 --> 01:39:42,172
I've been trying to find you
since 6:00.

1428
01:39:42,344 --> 01:39:45,547
- Where did you go?
- To Max's Hardware Store.

1429
01:39:45,723 --> 01:39:48,260
- Where?
- Max's Hardware Store!

1430
01:39:48,433 --> 01:39:50,722
My watering can fell off the roof.

1431
01:39:50,894 --> 01:39:54,060
But...? But where have you been
since then?

1432
01:39:54,230 --> 01:39:55,890
You knew we were supposed to work.
I had...

1433
01:39:56,066 --> 01:39:57,893
Oh, you wanted to do
some researching tonight?

1434
01:39:58,067 --> 01:39:59,728
- You know, with me?
- Of course.

1435
01:40:00,153 --> 01:40:03,403
Casually glance at some
old English stuff together?

1436
01:40:03,573 --> 01:40:05,899
- We might. It's possible.
- And maybe top off the evening

1437
01:40:06,075 --> 01:40:07,155
with a little hypnotism?

1438
01:40:07,327 --> 01:40:09,402
Sort of one little trance
before nighty-night?

1439
01:40:09,578 --> 01:40:11,453
- It's for your good, Daisy.
- Get off my roof!

1440
01:40:11,622 --> 01:40:14,742
- What?
- I said, get off my roof!

1441
01:40:14,918 --> 01:40:16,909
- What's the matter?
- Get this straight, Chabot.

1442
01:40:17,086 --> 01:40:18,415
Your courting days are over.

1443
01:40:18,587 --> 01:40:21,209
I am through being a go-between
for you and your dream girl.

1444
01:40:21,382 --> 01:40:23,755
You're not gonna go on
using my head for a motel!

1445
01:40:23,926 --> 01:40:26,464
Oh, my God. This is disastrous.

1446
01:40:26,637 --> 01:40:27,751
Oh, no.

1447
01:40:27,930 --> 01:40:30,600
Now that you know who you are,
you can influence every memory.

1448
01:40:30,767 --> 01:40:32,094
You're no longer reliable.

1449
01:40:32,267 --> 01:40:33,678
How did you find out? Who told you?

1450
01:40:33,852 --> 01:40:35,929
- I played a tape, and all I can say...
- Which tape?

1451
01:40:36,104 --> 01:40:38,430
- How do I know?! All I can say is...
- What was it about?

1452
01:40:38,608 --> 01:40:40,516
It was in a foreign language!
All I can say is...

1453
01:40:40,693 --> 01:40:42,851
- Did you tell anyone?
- And get put in a circus? No.

1454
01:40:43,028 --> 01:40:45,946
All I can say is... Oh, rats,
I don't even remember anymore.

1455
01:40:46,115 --> 01:40:47,443
Oh, yeah, yeah. All I can say is,

1456
01:40:47,615 --> 01:40:50,189
if you tell anybody it's me, I'll sue.
Do you hear me? I'll sue!

1457
01:40:50,953 --> 01:40:52,495
There may still be a chance.
Daisy...

1458
01:40:52,663 --> 01:40:54,407
The first finger that touches me,
I cut off.

1459
01:40:54,581 --> 01:40:57,785
Daisy, I insist you stop
this neurotic behaviour at once.

1460
01:40:57,959 --> 01:40:59,703
Neurotic?!
You get the hots over somebody

1461
01:40:59,879 --> 01:41:02,629
you're not even sure was anybody,
you call me neurotic?!

1462
01:41:02,797 --> 01:41:05,288
Physician, heal thyself!

1463
01:41:05,467 --> 01:41:08,800
Daisy. Daisy, Daisy, because
I didn't tell you what I was doing,

1464
01:41:08,971 --> 01:41:10,962
you may feel betrayed and hurt.

1465
01:41:11,139 --> 01:41:14,056
But a case like yours
happens once in a million years.

1466
01:41:14,226 --> 01:41:17,310
And, Daisy, we have a breathtaking
adventure in front of us.

1467
01:41:17,479 --> 01:41:22,306
By the time we finish, you may find
yourself not only not an abnormal girl,

1468
01:41:22,483 --> 01:41:25,519
but one of the few genuinely normal
people on Earth.

1469
01:41:25,695 --> 01:41:27,023
Get off my roof!

1470
01:41:27,196 --> 01:41:30,566
I will not get off your roof
until I bring you to your senses.

1471
01:41:30,742 --> 01:41:33,149
Any other girl would be proud
to be part of this adventure.

1472
01:41:33,369 --> 01:41:36,821
Great. If you want to experiment,
go pick on someone else.

1473
01:41:36,996 --> 01:41:39,999
I can't, Daisy. I can't.
Daisy, I need you.

1474
01:41:42,669 --> 01:41:45,042
You bet your Aunt Susie
you need me.

1475
01:41:45,214 --> 01:41:47,088
And not for the noble cause
of science, either.

1476
01:41:47,257 --> 01:41:49,464
- You wanna see Melinda.
- Melinda's beside the point.

1477
01:41:49,634 --> 01:41:53,585
- You got the hots for Melinda!
- I am not your business!

1478
01:41:56,017 --> 01:41:58,008
That's right, doctor.

1479
01:41:58,977 --> 01:42:00,721
You're not.

1480
01:42:00,896 --> 01:42:03,931
And I'm not yours either.

1481
01:42:05,150 --> 01:42:07,356
Now, if you'll excuse me,
I got a lot of things to do.

1482
01:42:07,528 --> 01:42:09,520
I gotta... I gotta spend more time
with Warren.

1483
01:42:09,697 --> 01:42:11,522
I gotta plan my life
with Chemical Foods.

1484
01:42:11,698 --> 01:42:13,109
And I need my roof!

1485
01:42:13,283 --> 01:42:16,200
So if you don't mind,
one, two, three, beat it!

1486
01:42:16,912 --> 01:42:18,536
Your roof?

1487
01:42:18,706 --> 01:42:20,329
Very well, keep your roof.

1488
01:42:20,498 --> 01:42:22,621
It's as close to heaven
as you'll ever get.

1489
01:42:23,041 --> 01:42:24,952
Melinda's soul inside of you?

1490
01:42:25,379 --> 01:42:28,463
God, what a housing shortage.

1491
01:42:30,967 --> 01:42:33,719
Damn you, Daisy,
I can't let you free. I can't.

1492
01:42:33,887 --> 01:42:36,424
Not with all the buried treasure
inside you.

1493
01:42:36,597 --> 01:42:37,760
- Help!
- You'll see me again.

1494
01:42:37,932 --> 01:42:40,257
You can count on that.
Again and again.

1495
01:42:40,435 --> 01:42:43,850
You have an appointment
tomorrow at 6. Be there!

1496
01:42:46,482 --> 01:42:48,190
Clip, clip!

1497
01:43:01,455 --> 01:43:03,033
Rats.

1498
01:43:13,759 --> 01:43:18,800
Oh, no, you don't,
Dr Marc Chabot.

1499
01:43:18,973 --> 01:43:21,095
You are not going to hypnotize me
into coming back.

1500
01:43:21,767 --> 01:43:24,435
Fourscore and seven years ago,
our forefathers brought forth upon

1501
01:43:24,603 --> 01:43:26,560
this continent a new nation
conceived in liberty

1502
01:43:26,730 --> 01:43:28,353
and dedicated to the proposition...

1503
01:43:29,274 --> 01:43:31,432
Mary had a little lamb,
its fleece was white as snow.

1504
01:43:31,610 --> 01:43:34,564
Everywhere that Mary went,
her lamb was sure to...

1505
01:43:43,288 --> 01:43:44,782
Hey, what in the name of...?

1506
01:43:47,750 --> 01:43:50,288
What the hell do you mean, "shh"?

1507
01:43:51,004 --> 01:43:52,545
Jerk.

1508
01:43:54,924 --> 01:43:57,629
Fourscore and seven years ago,
our forefathers brought forth upon...

1509
01:43:57,802 --> 01:43:59,343
- Daisy!
- A new nation...

1510
01:43:59,512 --> 01:44:01,836
- Daisy, what are you doing?
- Liberty and dedicated to...

1511
01:44:02,014 --> 01:44:05,134
Daisy, what's happened to you?!
I left you a while ago, you were quiet.

1512
01:44:05,309 --> 01:44:09,057
Daisy, pay attention!
What are you doing?!

1513
01:44:09,230 --> 01:44:11,899
Daisy, what in heaven...?
That's rude.

1514
01:44:12,066 --> 01:44:15,482
That is very rude, and I'm shocked.
That, Daisy, is not necessary.

1515
01:44:15,652 --> 01:44:17,858
I like you the way you are.
Daisy! Listen to me!

1516
01:44:18,030 --> 01:44:19,228
Oh, Warren!

1517
01:44:19,407 --> 01:44:21,280
This is not behaving
in a company way.

1518
01:44:21,451 --> 01:44:24,617
Daisy, will you...
For Pete's sake, look out!

1519
01:44:25,537 --> 01:44:26,996
Marc!

1520
01:44:27,164 --> 01:44:28,575
Yes, Conrad.

1521
01:44:30,333 --> 01:44:32,243
Marc, get out the champagne.

1522
01:44:32,752 --> 01:44:35,078
Shake out the confetti.

1523
01:44:35,255 --> 01:44:38,540
- What's the matter with you?
- I solved your case, that's all.

1524
01:44:38,716 --> 01:44:41,006
Will you ever forgive me?

1525
01:44:41,176 --> 01:44:43,503
The place to look for spooks,
my dear doctor,

1526
01:44:43,680 --> 01:44:46,384
is not in a medical library
or in Burke's Peerage,

1527
01:44:46,558 --> 01:44:48,467
but in a spook book.

1528
01:44:48,643 --> 01:44:54,977
This is an encyclopaedia
of 19th-century psychics.

1529
01:44:55,650 --> 01:44:57,975
- May I read aloud?
- Yes, go on.

1530
01:44:59,654 --> 01:45:02,856
"Tentrees, Melinda. Clairvoyant.

1531
01:45:03,032 --> 01:45:06,532
Dates, 1787-1815.

1532
01:45:06,703 --> 01:45:09,027
Married to Sir Robert Tentrees.

1533
01:45:09,205 --> 01:45:12,159
In celebrated case,
Melinda Tentrees found guilty

1534
01:45:12,333 --> 01:45:14,622
of conspiring with enemies
of the crown

1535
01:45:14,794 --> 01:45:17,997
and was executed one year
after sentencing."

1536
01:45:18,171 --> 01:45:19,796
How does that grab you?

1537
01:45:20,132 --> 01:45:21,626
What about her husband?

1538
01:45:21,801 --> 01:45:24,552
Oh, yeah, well, that's here.
That's here.

1539
01:45:25,762 --> 01:45:28,385
"Melinda Tentrees claimed
all her information resulted

1540
01:45:28,557 --> 01:45:33,432
from psychic powers, but her husband
failed to appear at her trial.

1541
01:45:34,062 --> 01:45:37,064
His evidence might have saved her."

1542
01:45:37,858 --> 01:45:39,566
Well,

1543
01:45:39,734 --> 01:45:41,063
there it is.

1544
01:45:45,491 --> 01:45:50,199
And may I add that I find your gratitude
absolutely underwhelming.

1545
01:45:51,413 --> 01:45:55,492
Then she is not an illusion.
She lived.

1546
01:45:56,125 --> 01:45:58,913
Conrad, I have the feeling
I've known that girl before.

1547
01:45:59,921 --> 01:46:02,957
I've got to find out if it's true.

1548
01:46:10,223 --> 01:46:11,552
Hi, fella.

1549
01:46:11,724 --> 01:46:13,966
- Hi.
- You seen Daisy?

1550
01:46:14,144 --> 01:46:16,101
- No.
- That's good.

1551
01:46:16,605 --> 01:46:17,849
Is something the matter?

1552
01:46:18,355 --> 01:46:21,725
No, no, no, it's just that we have a date
tonight with the personnel director

1553
01:46:21,901 --> 01:46:24,818
of Chemical Foods at 6:00
at the Americana and his wife.

1554
01:46:24,987 --> 01:46:27,942
I just wanna make sure
she doesn't forget it again.

1555
01:46:28,115 --> 01:46:29,657
I wouldn't worry about that now.

1556
01:46:30,035 --> 01:46:32,441
Yeah, well, you wouldn't worry
about it now because it's me.

1557
01:46:32,619 --> 01:46:35,371
- Wait till you have to get a job.
- I'm not going to.

1558
01:46:36,165 --> 01:46:37,743
Oh, really?

1559
01:46:37,917 --> 01:46:40,454
Oh, how you gonna arrange that?

1560
01:46:40,627 --> 01:46:42,038
I'm rich.

1561
01:46:43,547 --> 01:46:45,789
Oh, boy.

1562
01:46:46,550 --> 01:46:49,551
Oh, that's depressing.

1563
01:46:49,720 --> 01:46:53,504
You know, it's funny you never know
where Daisy is.

1564
01:46:54,266 --> 01:46:55,380
Why?

1565
01:46:55,559 --> 01:46:59,176
Well, you're engaged to her.
Don't you ever ask her what she does?

1566
01:46:59,355 --> 01:47:00,979
No.

1567
01:47:01,148 --> 01:47:04,018
- You're incredible.
- Top 2 percent.

1568
01:47:04,192 --> 01:47:07,110
Listen, how come I never see you
with any medical books?

1569
01:47:07,278 --> 01:47:09,984
I mean, are you really going to school,
or did you buy the teacher?

1570
01:47:10,656 --> 01:47:11,819
I haven't started yet.

1571
01:47:12,325 --> 01:47:13,819
Then why are you hanging
around here?

1572
01:47:14,452 --> 01:47:17,537
- Actually, I came to see Daisy.
- Why?

1573
01:47:18,290 --> 01:47:20,282
She wrote me that she
was gonna be married

1574
01:47:20,458 --> 01:47:23,578
and I wanted to see
if she was happy.

1575
01:47:26,672 --> 01:47:28,333
Too bad.

1576
01:47:28,507 --> 01:47:30,666
Why, you got a better idea?

1577
01:47:30,843 --> 01:47:32,006
Yes.

1578
01:47:32,178 --> 01:47:33,210
Me.

1579
01:47:33,679 --> 01:47:34,959
You?

1580
01:47:35,139 --> 01:47:37,215
That's incest!

1581
01:47:37,392 --> 01:47:41,010
- We're only related by marriage.
- Well, what other way is there?

1582
01:47:41,478 --> 01:47:44,314
- Morning.
- Morning.

1583
01:47:47,652 --> 01:47:50,023
Honey, you look kind of tired.
You ought to go back to bed.

1584
01:47:50,195 --> 01:47:53,564
I mean, you gotta be
in top form tonight.

1585
01:47:53,991 --> 01:47:56,198
Daisy, do you remember
everything we talked about?

1586
01:47:56,369 --> 01:47:57,946
- Yeah.
- All right, now, listen, Daisy,

1587
01:47:58,119 --> 01:48:00,872
for God's sake, don't let on that
you know that screwball hypnotist.

1588
01:48:01,040 --> 01:48:03,994
Sweet mother India,
if they ever found out about that...

1589
01:48:04,168 --> 01:48:07,786
Oh, hey, Daisy, I got a great piece
of news for you. You ready?

1590
01:48:07,962 --> 01:48:09,872
You don't have to worry
about the cigarettes.

1591
01:48:10,048 --> 01:48:12,799
I found out Mrs Unkstadder
is a chain-smoker.

1592
01:48:12,968 --> 01:48:15,376
Isn't that a hot one, huh?

1593
01:48:19,266 --> 01:48:20,428
Oh, that is...

1594
01:48:20,600 --> 01:48:24,100
That... That is really a hot one.

1595
01:48:25,021 --> 01:48:26,812
Oh, Warren, that...

1596
01:48:26,982 --> 01:48:30,895
That is really a riot.

1597
01:48:31,778 --> 01:48:33,320
Isn't that a hot riot, Tad?

1598
01:48:35,740 --> 01:48:37,697
Well...

1599
01:48:38,743 --> 01:48:41,579
...l've really got a hot one
for you too, Warren.

1600
01:48:42,164 --> 01:48:45,532
I'm that patient of Dr Chabot's.

1601
01:48:46,624 --> 01:48:48,915
I'm Melinda.

1602
01:48:49,587 --> 01:48:51,081
I'm not hearing this.

1603
01:48:52,340 --> 01:48:55,210
And do you know why
my flowers get so tall?

1604
01:48:56,427 --> 01:48:58,300
Because I talk to them.

1605
01:48:58,845 --> 01:49:01,597
Every morning I come up here
and I read them Walter Lippmann.

1606
01:49:02,600 --> 01:49:04,308
You talk to them?

1607
01:49:06,728 --> 01:49:08,721
And do you know what else?

1608
01:49:09,189 --> 01:49:10,850
I can tell when the phone's
gonna ring.

1609
01:49:11,609 --> 01:49:12,806
Walter Lippmann?

1610
01:49:12,985 --> 01:49:14,609
Watch.

1611
01:49:16,654 --> 01:49:18,280
Tell him I'm out!

1612
01:49:19,950 --> 01:49:21,741
Hello? She's out.

1613
01:49:21,910 --> 01:49:25,611
Now, Warren, what time do we
meet tonight, huh? Six o'clock?

1614
01:49:25,789 --> 01:49:28,114
Oh, great. I just can't wait for you
to see my new dress.

1615
01:49:28,292 --> 01:49:31,494
Oh, it is not too low,
it is not too short.

1616
01:49:31,670 --> 01:49:33,045
It is transparent!

1617
01:49:33,379 --> 01:49:35,289
- But, Daisy, what...?
- I can't, Warren!

1618
01:49:35,465 --> 01:49:36,745
- I just can't!
- But, Daisy...

1619
01:49:36,925 --> 01:49:38,549
Oh, Warren!

1620
01:49:42,597 --> 01:49:44,969
Get off my roof.

1621
01:49:59,197 --> 01:50:02,150
I've been calling for eight days,
and for eight days

1622
01:50:02,324 --> 01:50:05,741
I've been told Miss Gamble is out.
When has she been in?

1623
01:50:05,912 --> 01:50:08,865
If she's not been in,
then she's not out. She's away.

1624
01:50:09,040 --> 01:50:11,709
Now, which is it?
Is she out or is she away?

1625
01:50:11,876 --> 01:50:13,418
And if she's away, when did...?

1626
01:50:13,586 --> 01:50:15,874
Hello. Hello!

1627
01:50:18,173 --> 01:50:19,834
If you don't mind my saying so,
doctor,

1628
01:50:20,009 --> 01:50:22,546
why are you so interested
in coming back?

1629
01:50:22,719 --> 01:50:25,839
You don't seem to be having
that good a time.

1630
01:50:26,014 --> 01:50:28,340
Thank you, Mrs Hatch.

1631
01:50:28,518 --> 01:50:30,805
You've done the impossible.

1632
01:50:30,978 --> 01:50:32,851
You've given my depression

1633
01:50:33,021 --> 01:50:34,895
a depression.

1634
01:50:44,324 --> 01:50:48,025
You're out there somewhere,
Daisy Gamble.

1635
01:50:48,203 --> 01:50:49,400
And you can hear me.

1636
01:50:49,913 --> 01:50:52,155
So listen!

1637
01:50:52,332 --> 01:50:55,249
Hear my voice
Where you are

1638
01:50:55,418 --> 01:50:58,585
Take the train
Steal a car

1639
01:50:58,755 --> 01:51:01,921
Hop a freight
Grab a star

1640
01:51:02,091 --> 01:51:04,380
Come back to me

1641
01:51:05,386 --> 01:51:08,422
Catch a plane
Catch a breeze

1642
01:51:08,598 --> 01:51:11,552
On your hands
On your knees

1643
01:51:11,726 --> 01:51:14,976
Swim or fly
Only, please

1644
01:51:15,146 --> 01:51:17,517
Come back to me

1645
01:51:18,357 --> 01:51:21,358
On a mule
In a jet

1646
01:51:21,528 --> 01:51:24,860
With your hair in a net
In a towel, wringing wet

1647
01:51:25,029 --> 01:51:26,310
I don't care

1648
01:51:26,490 --> 01:51:30,737
This is where
You should be

1649
01:51:31,453 --> 01:51:34,454
From the hills
From the shore

1650
01:51:34,623 --> 01:51:37,743
Ride the wind to my door

1651
01:51:37,919 --> 01:51:40,753
Turn the highway to dust

1652
01:51:41,129 --> 01:51:44,000
Break the law if you must

1653
01:51:44,341 --> 01:51:47,425
Move the world, only just

1654
01:51:47,593 --> 01:51:49,883
Come back to me

1655
01:51:52,057 --> 01:51:54,594
Making a soufflé requires
alertness and cunning

1656
01:51:55,143 --> 01:51:59,472
and patience.
And above all, stamina.

1657
01:51:59,648 --> 01:52:01,475
Beat, beat, beat.

1658
01:52:01,650 --> 01:52:04,899
Blast your hide
Hear me call

1659
01:52:05,695 --> 01:52:08,946
Must I fight city hall?

1660
01:52:09,115 --> 01:52:11,985
Here and now
Damn it all

1661
01:52:12,160 --> 01:52:14,366
Come back to me

1662
01:52:15,371 --> 01:52:18,407
What on earth must I do?

1663
01:52:18,582 --> 01:52:21,702
Scream and yell till I'm blue?

1664
01:52:21,878 --> 01:52:23,420
Curse your soul

1665
01:52:23,588 --> 01:52:27,039
When will you come back to me?

1666
01:52:28,509 --> 01:52:31,878
Have you gone to the moon?

1667
01:52:32,055 --> 01:52:34,924
Or the corner saloon
And to rack and to ruin

1668
01:52:35,099 --> 01:52:38,100
Mademoiselle, where in hell

1669
01:52:38,269 --> 01:52:41,388
Can you be?

1670
01:52:41,605 --> 01:52:44,689
Leave a sign on your door

1671
01:52:44,859 --> 01:52:48,062
Out to lunch
Evermore

1672
01:52:48,236 --> 01:52:51,071
In a Rolls or a van

1673
01:52:51,532 --> 01:52:54,817
Wrapped in mink or saran

1674
01:52:54,994 --> 01:52:57,864
Any way that you can

1675
01:52:58,329 --> 01:53:02,624
Come back to me

1676
01:53:05,670 --> 01:53:07,328
Damn you, Daisy Gamble,
where are you?

1677
01:53:07,506 --> 01:53:09,831
Why can't you pick up a phone?

1678
01:53:10,009 --> 01:53:13,044
Hear my voice
Through the din

1679
01:53:13,219 --> 01:53:15,925
Feel the waves
On your skin

1680
01:53:16,472 --> 01:53:19,676
Like a call from within

1681
01:53:19,851 --> 01:53:22,520
Come back to me

1682
01:53:22,979 --> 01:53:26,099
Leave behind all you own

1683
01:53:26,274 --> 01:53:29,310
Tell your flowers you will phone

1684
01:53:29,486 --> 01:53:32,606
Let your dog walk alone

1685
01:53:32,780 --> 01:53:35,353
Come back to me

1686
01:53:36,158 --> 01:53:39,409
Let your tub overflow

1687
01:53:39,579 --> 01:53:42,614
If a date waits below
Let him wait for Godot

1688
01:53:42,790 --> 01:53:43,952
Ride a rail

1689
01:53:44,125 --> 01:53:45,749
Come by mail

1690
01:53:45,918 --> 01:53:48,374
COD

1691
01:53:49,088 --> 01:53:52,291
Par avion
Par bateau

1692
01:53:52,466 --> 01:53:54,838
Dans une vieille
Deux chevaux

1693
01:54:03,978 --> 01:54:07,013
Come by steam
Come by gas

1694
01:54:07,189 --> 01:54:10,225
Come for free
On a pass

1695
01:54:10,401 --> 01:54:13,484
Under drugs
Under glass

1696
01:54:13,653 --> 01:54:16,488
Come back to me

1697
01:54:17,073 --> 01:54:20,442
Leave your bills all unpaid

1698
01:54:20,618 --> 01:54:23,655
Let your bed go unmade

1699
01:54:23,831 --> 01:54:26,867
Your soufflé unsouffléd

1700
01:54:27,042 --> 01:54:28,868
Come back to me

1701
01:54:30,170 --> 01:54:33,455
Come by sail
Come by freight

1702
01:54:33,632 --> 01:54:36,585
In a box or a crate
With your head on a plate

1703
01:54:36,759 --> 01:54:38,170
I don't care

1704
01:54:38,344 --> 01:54:42,425
This is where you should be

1705
01:54:43,391 --> 01:54:46,475
Come in pain or in joy

1706
01:54:46,644 --> 01:54:49,646
As a girl, as a boy

1707
01:54:49,814 --> 01:54:51,687
In a bag or a trunk

1708
01:54:51,857 --> 01:54:53,020
Shut up!

1709
01:54:53,192 --> 01:54:56,110
On a horse or a drunk

1710
01:54:56,445 --> 01:54:59,529
In a Ford or a funk

1711
01:54:59,698 --> 01:55:02,902
Come back to me

1712
01:55:03,077 --> 01:55:06,114
Come back to me

1713
01:55:06,287 --> 01:55:07,698
Come back...

1714
01:55:07,873 --> 01:55:09,118
Daisy!

1715
01:55:09,291 --> 01:55:11,699
Will you stop bothering me!

1716
01:55:11,877 --> 01:55:14,165
- Daisy, l...
- Day after day, night after night,

1717
01:55:14,337 --> 01:55:16,165
in the bathtub, on the roof,
awake or asleep.

1718
01:55:16,339 --> 01:55:17,715
What is this,
extrasensory torture?

1719
01:55:17,883 --> 01:55:19,875
I'd go to the police,
but with a story like this,

1720
01:55:20,052 --> 01:55:22,210
they'd have locked me up!
What do you want out of me?

1721
01:55:22,386 --> 01:55:23,715
Never mind, I know what you want,

1722
01:55:23,889 --> 01:55:25,762
and you can't have it
because I haven't got it.

1723
01:55:25,933 --> 01:55:27,131
Even if I did,
you wouldn't get it.

1724
01:55:27,309 --> 01:55:29,217
- What are you talking about?
- What you're thinking about, Melinda.

1725
01:55:29,394 --> 01:55:31,386
My name never was Melinda Tentrees.
Now, is that clear?

1726
01:55:31,563 --> 01:55:32,892
- How do you know?
- Because I know.

1727
01:55:33,064 --> 01:55:34,440
- How?
- Well, well, how could it be?

1728
01:55:34,608 --> 01:55:37,145
- I'm not like Melinda Tentrees.
- How do you know what she's like?

1729
01:55:37,318 --> 01:55:38,896
I don't, but you do,
and you like what she's like.

1730
01:55:39,070 --> 01:55:40,648
You don't like what I'm like,
so I know we're not alike.

1731
01:55:40,822 --> 01:55:42,613
I know what I'm like,
and I don't like it either.

1732
01:55:42,782 --> 01:55:44,443
Because I'm like nothing
and like nobody,

1733
01:55:44,617 --> 01:55:46,824
and nothing or nobody can change me.
I'm stuck as I am.

1734
01:55:46,994 --> 01:55:49,402
Weak, a go-alonger, no character!

1735
01:55:49,580 --> 01:55:51,988
- You have character to stop smoking.
- That's a dirty lie!

1736
01:55:52,167 --> 01:55:53,281
I didn't stop smoking,

1737
01:55:53,459 --> 01:55:55,286
you made my subconscious
stop wanting to.

1738
01:55:55,461 --> 01:55:59,045
And I went along, just like I always do.
Now, will you please leave me alone!

1739
01:55:59,215 --> 01:56:01,670
Will you please sit down!

1740
01:56:03,844 --> 01:56:05,672
Now, you listen to me!

1741
01:56:05,847 --> 01:56:07,389
As little as you know about Melinda,

1742
01:56:07,556 --> 01:56:12,017
it's gigantic compared to what
you know about Daisy Gamble.

1743
01:56:12,186 --> 01:56:14,856
You think you're nothing
and you walk around looking out

1744
01:56:15,022 --> 01:56:17,773
over the world like Jupiter
on Mount Olympus.

1745
01:56:17,942 --> 01:56:21,856
Imagine having eyes that can see
the lost article of a friend

1746
01:56:22,030 --> 01:56:23,856
or someone about to phone you

1747
01:56:24,030 --> 01:56:28,444
or to be filled with a kind of love
that pulls flowers from the ground.

1748
01:56:28,618 --> 01:56:30,029
And if that were not enough,

1749
01:56:30,204 --> 01:56:34,201
you either have a heart so deep
it spans the ages

1750
01:56:34,374 --> 01:56:39,332
or a mind that's filled
with the total memory of life.

1751
01:56:40,421 --> 01:56:42,379
Why, Daisy...

1752
01:56:43,717 --> 01:56:45,674
...you're a bloody miracle.

1753
01:56:46,886 --> 01:56:50,719
Could anyone among us
have an inkling or a clue

1754
01:56:51,182 --> 01:56:55,725
what magic feats of wizardry
and voodoo you can do?

1755
01:56:55,895 --> 01:57:01,518
And who would ever guess
What powers you possess?

1756
01:57:01,692 --> 01:57:06,818
And who would not be stunned
To see you prove

1757
01:57:06,989 --> 01:57:12,577
There's more to us
Than surgeons can remove?

1758
01:57:12,744 --> 01:57:16,446
So much more than we ever knew

1759
01:57:16,623 --> 01:57:20,325
So much more were we born to do

1760
01:57:20,502 --> 01:57:23,373
Should you draw back the curtain?

1761
01:57:23,548 --> 01:57:26,085
This, I am certain

1762
01:57:26,258 --> 01:57:29,675
You'll be impressed

1763
01:57:29,845 --> 01:57:33,843
With you

1764
01:57:37,603 --> 01:57:44,685
On a clear day

1765
01:57:45,152 --> 01:57:51,819
Rise and look around you

1766
01:57:53,786 --> 01:57:57,653
And you'll see

1767
01:57:57,830 --> 01:58:04,118
Who you are

1768
01:58:05,755 --> 01:58:10,416
On a clear day

1769
01:58:10,593 --> 01:58:15,670
How it will astound you

1770
01:58:15,849 --> 01:58:21,471
That the glow of your being

1771
01:58:21,646 --> 01:58:25,809
Outshines every star

1772
01:58:25,983 --> 01:58:30,645
You feel a part of

1773
01:58:30,822 --> 01:58:35,946
Every mountain, sea and shore

1774
01:58:36,118 --> 01:58:40,745
You can hear from far and near

1775
01:58:40,915 --> 01:58:47,035
A world you've never heard before

1776
01:58:47,671 --> 01:58:54,587
And on a clear day

1777
01:58:54,762 --> 01:58:59,589
On that clear day

1778
01:58:59,766 --> 01:59:05,389
You can see forever

1779
01:59:05,564 --> 01:59:08,020
And ever

1780
01:59:08,191 --> 01:59:10,517
And ever

1781
01:59:10,694 --> 01:59:20,361
And evermore

1782
01:59:27,084 --> 01:59:28,579
Gee.

1783
01:59:33,341 --> 01:59:35,250
Gee.

1784
01:59:36,844 --> 01:59:38,801
Daisy, I must hypnotize you

1785
01:59:38,971 --> 01:59:40,216
- one more time.
- No!

1786
01:59:40,389 --> 01:59:42,381
Not to see Melinda, I swear it.

1787
01:59:42,558 --> 01:59:45,643
Now that you know,
it would probably be distorted.

1788
01:59:45,811 --> 01:59:48,978
It's for another reason.
I ask you as a favour.

1789
01:59:49,273 --> 01:59:51,099
One last time.

1790
01:59:54,487 --> 01:59:57,239
Just hope I haven't forgotten how...

1791
02:00:06,582 --> 02:00:09,665
- Daisy, can you hear me?
- Yes.

1792
02:00:09,835 --> 02:00:11,793
Open your eyes.

1793
02:00:13,046 --> 02:00:16,665
I want you to concentrate
very, very hard.

1794
02:00:17,426 --> 02:00:20,925
You have told me about
your life as Melinda.

1795
02:00:21,429 --> 02:00:24,928
Do you remember
any other previous lifetimes?

1796
02:00:25,100 --> 02:00:26,594
Oh, sure.

1797
02:00:26,769 --> 02:00:28,511
How many?

1798
02:00:30,229 --> 02:00:31,428
Let's see.

1799
02:00:31,606 --> 02:00:35,770
One, two, three, four.

1800
02:00:36,235 --> 02:00:37,944
Five.

1801
02:00:38,612 --> 02:00:40,024
Six.

1802
02:00:40,198 --> 02:00:44,242
Seven, eight, nine, ten, 11, 12.

1803
02:00:44,619 --> 02:00:45,947
Thirteen.

1804
02:00:47,747 --> 02:00:51,411
- Fourteen...
- That's enough, Daisy.

1805
02:00:51,876 --> 02:00:54,082
In all those lifetimes,

1806
02:00:54,253 --> 02:00:57,088
do you ever remember...

1807
02:00:58,090 --> 02:01:00,711
...meeting me?

1808
02:01:02,636 --> 02:01:04,344
Yes.

1809
02:01:06,057 --> 02:01:08,594
Did we know each other well?

1810
02:01:08,767 --> 02:01:10,725
We were married.

1811
02:01:11,687 --> 02:01:13,846
Happily married?

1812
02:01:14,982 --> 02:01:17,306
It was...

1813
02:01:18,652 --> 02:01:21,274
...beyond anything.

1814
02:01:22,447 --> 02:01:24,902
What were our names?

1815
02:01:25,325 --> 02:01:27,995
Laura and John Caswell.

1816
02:01:29,663 --> 02:01:33,364
Laura and John Caswell.

1817
02:01:34,375 --> 02:01:36,333
Where did we live?

1818
02:01:37,420 --> 02:01:39,211
It's funny.

1819
02:01:39,464 --> 02:01:41,920
We lived in Virginia.

1820
02:01:43,177 --> 02:01:44,456
I can...

1821
02:01:44,636 --> 02:01:45,880
I can see us, but l...

1822
02:01:46,053 --> 02:01:48,295
I can't see all around us.

1823
02:01:50,308 --> 02:01:52,514
What year was it?

1824
02:01:52,686 --> 02:01:54,843
2038.

1825
02:02:11,703 --> 02:02:15,322
- I think I see...
- You don't have to go further.

1826
02:02:17,209 --> 02:02:19,416
No more questions.

1827
02:02:21,005 --> 02:02:23,542
Sleep until I count to three
and snap my fingers.

1828
02:02:23,715 --> 02:02:27,927
Then you will awaken and you
won't remember what you told me.

1829
02:02:29,722 --> 02:02:31,797
One, two, three.

1830
02:02:32,223 --> 02:02:33,801
Fine.

1831
02:02:34,810 --> 02:02:36,090
Thank you, Daisy.

1832
02:02:37,646 --> 02:02:39,472
When are you getting married?

1833
02:02:41,733 --> 02:02:43,940
Warren and I have severed
our relationship.

1834
02:02:44,945 --> 02:02:46,901
What are you going to do?

1835
02:02:47,530 --> 02:02:48,811
I don't know.

1836
02:02:48,990 --> 02:02:51,030
I thought I'd go up on the roof
for a while

1837
02:02:51,201 --> 02:02:53,110
and sit around with Tad.

1838
02:02:53,287 --> 02:02:55,527
You know, my ex-stepbrother.

1839
02:02:56,539 --> 02:02:57,998
I think that's a good idea.

1840
02:03:00,418 --> 02:03:03,752
- What about you?
- Well, you know, I'm married.

1841
02:03:04,839 --> 02:03:06,416
Oh, really?

1842
02:03:06,591 --> 02:03:08,879
Yes, but we're separated.

1843
02:03:09,052 --> 02:03:10,166
Oh, really?

1844
02:03:10,344 --> 02:03:14,757
I spoke to her and somehow
I think it will be all right now.

1845
02:03:16,017 --> 02:03:17,214
Oh, really.

1846
02:03:17,393 --> 02:03:20,844
She says I've changed.

1847
02:03:21,021 --> 02:03:22,350
Have you?

1848
02:03:23,733 --> 02:03:25,725
Yes. Thanks to you.

1849
02:03:27,277 --> 02:03:29,152
I used to be in love with answers,

1850
02:03:29,321 --> 02:03:33,401
but since I have known you,
I'm just as fond of the questions.

1851
02:03:34,325 --> 02:03:39,035
I think the answers make you wise,
but the questions make you human.

1852
02:03:40,540 --> 02:03:42,248
You got that from me?

1853
02:03:43,627 --> 02:03:44,908
Yes, I did.

1854
02:03:46,421 --> 02:03:47,999
Well,

1855
02:03:48,172 --> 02:03:50,331
I'm glad you got something.
It's only fair.

1856
02:03:50,509 --> 02:03:51,790
I don't smoke anymore.

1857
02:03:56,806 --> 02:03:58,514
Well...

1858
02:04:00,644 --> 02:04:02,802
Goodbye, doctor.

1859
02:04:06,858 --> 02:04:08,981
Goodbye, Daisy.

1860
02:04:10,613 --> 02:04:12,319
Bye.

1861
02:04:24,875 --> 02:04:27,449
Daisy, have you...?

1862
02:04:27,920 --> 02:04:30,542
Have you ever been to Virginia?

1863
02:04:31,007 --> 02:04:32,335
No.

1864
02:04:32,508 --> 02:04:33,836
Have you?

1865
02:04:34,009 --> 02:04:35,669
No.

1866
02:04:45,813 --> 02:04:47,605
Daisy.

1867
02:04:48,858 --> 02:04:50,980
You won't forget what I told you?

1868
02:04:55,615 --> 02:04:57,487
On...

1869
02:04:59,033 --> 02:05:01,026
...a clear day...

1870
02:05:02,371 --> 02:05:08,325
Rise and look around you

1871
02:05:09,711 --> 02:05:13,625
And you'll see

1872
02:05:13,798 --> 02:05:20,382
Who you are

1873
02:05:27,895 --> 02:05:29,888
Well...

1874
02:05:32,400 --> 02:05:33,943
So long, doctor.

1875
02:05:41,243 --> 02:05:43,033
See you later.

1876
02:06:21,698 --> 02:06:28,199
On a clear day

1877
02:06:28,954 --> 02:06:35,457
Rise and look around you

1878
02:06:36,421 --> 02:06:46,220
And you'll see who you are

1879
02:06:47,014 --> 02:06:52,388
On a clear day

1880
02:06:52,561 --> 02:06:56,808
How it will astound you

1881
02:06:56,983 --> 02:07:01,479
That the glow of your being

1882
02:07:01,653 --> 02:07:05,734
Outshines every star

1883
02:07:06,117 --> 02:07:09,319
You'll feel part of

1884
02:07:09,495 --> 02:07:13,493
Every mountain, sea and shore

1885
02:07:13,666 --> 02:07:18,908
You can hear from far and near

1886
02:07:19,087 --> 02:07:22,374
A world you never

1887
02:07:22,549 --> 02:07:28,339
Never heard before

1888
02:07:28,847 --> 02:07:36,345
And on a clear day

1889
02:07:36,521 --> 02:07:40,435
On that clear day

1890
02:07:40,608 --> 02:07:44,820
You can see forever

1891
02:07:44,988 --> 02:07:49,200
And ever and ever

1892
02:07:49,367 --> 02:07:59,166
And evermore
