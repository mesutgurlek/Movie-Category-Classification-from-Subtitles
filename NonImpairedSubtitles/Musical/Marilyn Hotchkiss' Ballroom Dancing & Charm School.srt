1
00:00:19,326 --> 00:00:21,181
No matter what happened,

2
00:00:22,014 --> 00:00:25,330
we would meet
on the fifth day of the fifth month

3
00:00:25,406 --> 00:00:27,479
of the fifth year of the new millennium

4
00:00:27,551 --> 00:00:31,096
at Marilyn Hotchkiss'
Ballroom Dancing and Charm School.

5
00:02:20,540 --> 00:02:22,067
- Yeah?
- It's back.

6
00:02:23,709 --> 00:02:25,716
- It's really strong today.
- Oh.

7
00:02:26,044 --> 00:02:27,604
And I'm not the only one
who smells it, either.

8
00:02:27,676 --> 00:02:29,781
My neighbor, Tim,
he was over about an hour and a half ago,

9
00:02:29,852 --> 00:02:32,471
- he smelled it, too. Loud and clear.
- Right.

10
00:02:32,541 --> 00:02:33,915
I had the pest control guys out.

11
00:02:33,980 --> 00:02:35,890
They said there's no droppings,
no nothing to indicate

12
00:02:35,964 --> 00:02:38,419
that rats or squirrels or anything
had been peeing in the walls.

13
00:02:38,492 --> 00:02:40,183
I've had the plumbers out
and the hardwood floor guys.

14
00:02:40,252 --> 00:02:41,746
The toxic mold people
wouldn't even come out.

15
00:02:41,820 --> 00:02:43,860
So you know what I'm doing now.

16
00:02:44,348 --> 00:02:45,395
Baking soda.

17
00:02:45,500 --> 00:02:48,696
I've coated the floor in about
a good solid inch and a half of baking soda.

18
00:02:48,860 --> 00:02:49,908
Why?

19
00:02:51,197 --> 00:02:52,822
Because it absorbs odor.

20
00:02:55,996 --> 00:02:58,200
Other people have had loved ones
come back as odors.

21
00:02:58,268 --> 00:03:00,210
I was reading about it on the Internet.

22
00:03:01,820 --> 00:03:04,569
<i>- There's a story of a guy that...
- I gotta go.</i>

23
00:03:04,636 --> 00:03:09,011
There's a guy who...
Frank? You okay? Frank?

24
00:03:16,892 --> 00:03:19,412
<i>This is 911.
Are you reporting an emergency?</i>

25
00:03:19,868 --> 00:03:20,915
Yeah.

26
00:03:21,467 --> 00:03:22,896
<i>Car accident?</i>

27
00:03:24,155 --> 00:03:25,235
Yeah.

28
00:03:28,124 --> 00:03:29,531
Bread truck.

29
00:03:29,596 --> 00:03:31,058
<i>What is your location, sir?</i>

30
00:03:31,131 --> 00:03:33,270
The old 99. Just south of Gorman.

31
00:03:36,731 --> 00:03:38,520
<i>How many cars involved, sir?</i>

32
00:03:39,931 --> 00:03:41,971
<i>- Sir?
- One.</i>

33
00:03:46,876 --> 00:03:49,526
<i>- Any injuries?
- Bad.</i>

34
00:03:49,756 --> 00:03:51,512
<i>Is the victim conscious?</i>

35
00:03:51,899 --> 00:03:53,426
I have an appointment.

36
00:03:55,420 --> 00:03:56,467
Yeah.

37
00:03:57,436 --> 00:03:59,574
I have an appointment.

38
00:03:59,643 --> 00:04:02,992
<i>This is very important, sir.
Keep him talking until the EMTs get there.</i>

39
00:04:03,067 --> 00:04:04,179
Yeah, but...

40
00:04:10,747 --> 00:04:12,569
You bake it or deliver it?

41
00:04:14,811 --> 00:04:16,786
Baker. Mostly.

42
00:04:17,691 --> 00:04:20,375
I've... I can figure a guy in a minute.

43
00:04:20,443 --> 00:04:21,969
It's a skill.

44
00:04:22,331 --> 00:04:24,470
It took me a lifetime to perfect it.

45
00:04:27,131 --> 00:04:28,440
Your name Keane?

46
00:04:31,291 --> 00:04:32,600
Keane, yeah.

47
00:04:35,642 --> 00:04:37,682
You been baking since 1903?

48
00:04:39,771 --> 00:04:40,719
No.

49
00:04:41,851 --> 00:04:46,007
Your father and his father,
and your father's father's father.

50
00:04:46,235 --> 00:04:50,391
You're the entrepreneur

51
00:04:50,810 --> 00:04:52,337
who brought the business here.

52
00:04:54,394 --> 00:04:56,533
I told you I could figure you.

53
00:04:58,586 --> 00:05:00,080
My name's Steve.

54
00:05:01,306 --> 00:05:02,735
Steve Mills.

55
00:05:06,555 --> 00:05:08,726
Not much of a talker, are you?

56
00:05:16,826 --> 00:05:19,095
- You have an appointment?
- Yeah.

57
00:05:19,866 --> 00:05:20,814
- I...
- You shouldn't move.

58
00:05:20,890 --> 00:05:22,297
I have an appointment.
I gotta get out of here.

59
00:05:22,362 --> 00:05:23,409
- Will you help me out?
- They said you...

60
00:05:23,482 --> 00:05:24,693
Buddy, I made this appointment...

61
00:05:24,762 --> 00:05:26,387
- Yeah, but...
...almost 40 years ago,

62
00:05:26,458 --> 00:05:28,880
and I'm gonna get there,
one way or another.

63
00:05:29,946 --> 00:05:31,091
Who with?

64
00:05:34,042 --> 00:05:35,351
The appointment.

65
00:05:37,178 --> 00:05:38,585
Lisa Gobar.

66
00:05:40,794 --> 00:05:43,412
- A girl.
- Yeah.

67
00:05:45,850 --> 00:05:46,798
You know,

68
00:05:49,017 --> 00:05:52,051
man, I can still see her face
like it was yesterday.

69
00:05:53,594 --> 00:05:55,088
I bet it's changed.

70
00:05:57,209 --> 00:05:58,158
What?

71
00:05:58,713 --> 00:05:59,662
Her face.

72
00:06:01,114 --> 00:06:04,463
Or maybe not. I mean, my wife was...

73
00:06:08,665 --> 00:06:09,875
My wife was...

74
00:06:17,498 --> 00:06:19,701
- Tell me about the girl.
- Lisa?

75
00:06:21,977 --> 00:06:24,246
- So you wanna know all about Lisa?
- Yeah.

76
00:06:26,713 --> 00:06:30,837
She had long blond hair and freckles

77
00:06:31,609 --> 00:06:33,267
and a little button nose.

78
00:06:36,409 --> 00:06:37,750
We were just kids.

79
00:06:42,777 --> 00:06:43,725
When?

80
00:06:45,113 --> 00:06:48,047
In 1962.

81
00:06:50,456 --> 00:06:52,049
Pez were cool.

82
00:06:52,984 --> 00:06:56,497
Zagnuts, Bomb Pops and Good & Plenty
were very cool.

83
00:06:57,497 --> 00:07:00,693
The gum in the baseball cards
still tasted good.

84
00:07:00,793 --> 00:07:02,549
Kennedy was president then.

85
00:07:03,832 --> 00:07:07,410
<i>Bay of Pigs, nuclear testing in Nevada,</i>

86
00:07:07,480 --> 00:07:08,690
<i>the Red Scare.</i>

87
00:07:10,104 --> 00:07:12,592
<i>McDonald's only had a million served.</i>

88
00:07:15,736 --> 00:07:19,893
<i>I was 12 years old,
and I hated girls more than liver.</i>

89
00:07:21,528 --> 00:07:24,910
<i>I mean, they weren't good
at any of the really important things.</i>

90
00:07:25,016 --> 00:07:28,594
<i>They always lost
in the cafeteria hot dog eating contest.</i>

91
00:07:29,464 --> 00:07:33,872
<i>Tommy Tanksley, he could unhinge
his mouth like a snake or something.</i>

92
00:07:34,936 --> 00:07:37,424
<i>And in rope-climbing,
they all got rope burn.</i>

93
00:07:37,496 --> 00:07:40,179
<i>They claimed
their hands were different than ours.</i>

94
00:07:40,888 --> 00:07:43,855
<i>And they couldn't spit worth a damn, either.</i>

95
00:07:45,880 --> 00:07:49,840
In an atomic explosion, class,
look for this sign.

96
00:07:50,328 --> 00:07:51,505
It can be...

97
00:07:51,576 --> 00:07:54,773
<i>But worse than not being able to spit,
not being able to climb rope</i>

98
00:07:54,840 --> 00:07:56,978
<i>or not being able to eat hot dogs as fast</i>

99
00:07:57,047 --> 00:08:00,463
<i>was that they were traitors.</i>

100
00:08:01,335 --> 00:08:04,270
Miss Parkinson, Miss Parkinson,
they're passing notes.

101
00:08:04,344 --> 00:08:05,653
And your body...

102
00:08:05,720 --> 00:08:07,575
<i>"Smelly turnip doo-doo.</i>

103
00:08:07,896 --> 00:08:10,863
"Cheesecake cheese dick.

104
00:08:11,703 --> 00:08:13,972
"Enema wiener wart.

105
00:08:14,200 --> 00:08:16,621
"Boner baby with hollandaise sauce."

106
00:08:16,695 --> 00:08:19,150
<i>That's why Peter, my best buddy,
and I had a blood pact,</i>

107
00:08:19,223 --> 00:08:21,711
<i>swearing and making girls cry</i>

108
00:08:21,784 --> 00:08:23,671
<i>was the most important thing.</i>

109
00:08:24,279 --> 00:08:28,021
- Cauliflower boner lug nut.
- Crusty Jell-O cheese dick.

110
00:08:29,207 --> 00:08:31,574
<i>The game was British bulldog.</i>

111
00:08:31,640 --> 00:08:35,120
<i>You had to run across the field
without being tagged, and it was fun.</i>

112
00:08:35,191 --> 00:08:37,013
<i>It was like war.</i>

113
00:08:37,079 --> 00:08:38,901
<i>We saw all the war pictures:</i>

114
00:08:39,031 --> 00:08:41,900
Bridge Over the River Kwai,
The Longest Day,

115
00:08:41,975 --> 00:08:44,397
Guns of Navarone, Hellcats of the Navy,

116
00:08:44,471 --> 00:08:48,213
The Naked and the Dead,
Men in War, The War Lover,

117
00:08:48,279 --> 00:08:52,305
The Great Escape,
Battle Cry, Pork Chop Hill.

118
00:08:53,783 --> 00:08:54,731
Come on.

119
00:08:55,287 --> 00:08:56,269
I'll get you, you butthead.

120
00:08:56,343 --> 00:08:58,612
<i>To most guys, it was more than a game.</i>

121
00:08:58,678 --> 00:08:59,889
<i>Kenny Dulin.</i>

122
00:09:00,215 --> 00:09:02,800
Come on, Dulin. Hurry up, you dickweed.

123
00:09:02,870 --> 00:09:04,943
<i>He was kind of an idiot. The story had it</i>

124
00:09:05,015 --> 00:09:07,764
<i>that his dad was changing the oil in the car,
the jack let out,</i>

125
00:09:07,830 --> 00:09:11,213
<i>and the car rolled over his head.
That's how come he was such a boner.</i>

126
00:09:11,287 --> 00:09:15,083
- British bulldog!
- British bulldog!

127
00:09:15,158 --> 00:09:16,816
British bulldog!

128
00:09:21,878 --> 00:09:24,693
<i>But this day was different from all the rest.</i>

129
00:09:24,758 --> 00:09:27,278
<i>When suddenly, something happened.</i>

130
00:09:27,350 --> 00:09:29,969
<i>Something happened
that had never happened</i>

131
00:09:30,039 --> 00:09:31,533
<i>in the history of British bulldog.</i>

132
00:09:31,607 --> 00:09:33,330
Lisa and I wanna play.

133
00:09:33,558 --> 00:09:35,347
- No!
- No way.

134

<i>Lisa Gobar and Kate Collmary.</i>

136
00:09:57,846 --> 00:09:59,634
Steve, help me!

137
00:09:59,702 --> 00:10:02,223
What about the battalion?
I gotta save the battalion!

138
00:10:02,294 --> 00:10:05,642
Screw the battalion, you dorkface dickweed.

139
00:10:05,718 --> 00:10:09,198
- Save me!
- Screw you!

<i>I didn't really mean to do that.</i>

<i>But it was war, right?</i>

142
00:10:33,429 --> 00:10:35,087
Would you stop crying?

143
00:10:43,061 --> 00:10:44,009
Yeah!

144
00:10:44,214 --> 00:10:46,635
- Look, I'm sorry.
- God, you didn't have to hit her.

145
00:10:46,709 --> 00:10:48,564
That's how come girls don't play.

146
00:10:48,629 --> 00:10:50,898
Don't you think
you've done enough already?

147
00:10:54,485 --> 00:10:55,826
We hate you!

148
00:10:56,501 --> 00:10:59,599
- Way to go. They'll never play again.
- Come on, let's go.

149
00:10:59,765 --> 00:11:02,547
- Danish duck farts.
- Creamed corn shit bricks.

150
00:11:03,605 --> 00:11:05,744
- You guys want another round?
- Yeah!

151
00:11:10,421 --> 00:11:13,737
Buddy, I made this appointment
almost 40 years ago,

152
00:11:13,813 --> 00:11:16,234
and I plan to keep it, one way or the other.

153
00:12:04,692 --> 00:12:06,514
You here for the dance class?

154
00:12:11,252 --> 00:12:13,772
Ayisha Lebaron. I'm the sign-in lady.

Well, it's good to have you, Frank.

Go on.

162
00:13:00,051 --> 00:13:02,539
- Excuse me. Is your name Lisa?
- No.

163
00:13:06,131 --> 00:13:08,139
- Right.
- Sorry.

164
00:13:12,275 --> 00:13:13,223
I fell.

165
00:13:14,483 --> 00:13:15,793
Down the stairs.

166
00:13:16,819 --> 00:13:17,996
It was crazy.

167
00:13:18,963 --> 00:13:19,945
You fell?

168
00:13:20,019 --> 00:13:22,474
I got it on sale. I have to show it to you.

169
00:13:22,547 --> 00:13:24,270
- Do you wanna see it?
- Yeah.

170
00:13:24,338 --> 00:13:26,248
Where do you have it? Let's go.

171
00:13:33,938 --> 00:13:35,149
She's trouble.

172
00:13:40,627 --> 00:13:42,415
- What?
- Meredith.

173
00:13:42,611 --> 00:13:45,328
Stay away from her, or you'll be sorry.

174
00:13:48,435 --> 00:13:49,645
Are you Lisa?

175
00:13:50,707 --> 00:13:52,398
No. Tina.

176
00:13:53,298 --> 00:13:55,502
Nice to make your acquaintance, Frank.

177
00:13:56,626 --> 00:13:59,757
- You know my name.
- I made it my business to know your name.

178
00:14:01,619 --> 00:14:02,731
Right.

179
00:14:03,474 --> 00:14:06,158
The first class
can be a little bit overwhelming.

180
00:14:06,419 --> 00:14:10,347
So hang tough and avoid that breath.

181
00:14:10,418 --> 00:14:13,647
Honey, she could stop traffic
with that breath.

182
00:14:19,858 --> 00:14:22,924
<i>Girls on the pink line, boys on the blue.</i>

183
00:14:24,722 --> 00:14:25,670
<i>Freeway?</i>

184
00:14:37,809 --> 00:14:42,544
<i>Welcome, everyone,
to Thursday Nights with Marilyn Hotchkiss.</i>

185
00:14:43,217 --> 00:14:46,730
<i>As my beloved mother, Marilyn,
cannot be here with us this evening,</i>

186
00:14:47,026 --> 00:14:50,954
<i>I will, with your permission
and by the grace of God,</i>

187
00:14:51,409 --> 00:14:53,068
<i>proudly conduct her class.</i>

188
00:14:53,906 --> 00:14:56,426
Marilyn passed away in 1978.

189
00:14:56,978 --> 00:14:59,694
<i>Tonight we have a new student.</i>

190
00:14:59,985 --> 00:15:02,124
<i>His name is Frank Keane.</i>

191
00:15:04,978 --> 00:15:06,385
<i>Welcome, Mr. Keane.</i>

192
00:15:11,057 --> 00:15:14,505
Tonight's class will begin
with a review of the lindy hop.

193
00:15:15,665 --> 00:15:18,665
Most of you will remember
this energetic rhythm dance,

194
00:15:18,737 --> 00:15:22,992
which incorporates elements
of the West Coast swing and the Charleston.

195
00:15:23,345 --> 00:15:25,712
Those of you who don't, watch me closely.

196
00:15:28,433 --> 00:15:29,959
Mr. Ipswitch,

197
00:15:30,705 --> 00:15:33,160
would you care to assist me
in demonstrating?

198
00:16:32,816 --> 00:16:33,863
Mr. Keane.

199
00:16:35,920 --> 00:16:37,928
May I have this dance, sir?

200
00:16:38,960 --> 00:16:40,008
Well, go on now.

201
00:16:48,400 --> 00:16:52,524
- May I have this dance, sir?
- Yes.

202
00:16:56,432 --> 00:16:59,563
And rock step, triple step,

203
00:16:59,631 --> 00:17:03,657
triple step, rock step,
triple step, triple step, rock step.

204
00:17:03,727 --> 00:17:07,404
The lindy hop was so named
after Charles Lindbergh's flight to Paris

205
00:17:07,471 --> 00:17:10,505
in 1927,
when the newspaper headlines read,

206
00:17:10,576 --> 00:17:12,398
"Lindy Hops the Atlantic."

207
00:17:12,463 --> 00:17:15,146
Rock step, triple step, triple step, rock step.

208
00:17:15,216 --> 00:17:18,598
In Harlem, the lindy hop was breaking out
wherever people were dancing.

209
00:17:18,672 --> 00:17:20,527
...triple step, triple step, rock step.

210
00:17:20,592 --> 00:17:23,461
But it wasn't until the opening
of the Savoy Ballroom

211
00:17:23,535 --> 00:17:25,029
that the lindy hop got its home.

212
00:17:25,103 --> 00:17:26,052
Lift.

213
00:17:26,127 --> 00:17:27,589
The lindy hop got hotter and hotter

214
00:17:27,664 --> 00:17:30,184
as the people danced to the top big bands
in the land.

215
00:17:30,255 --> 00:17:32,426
And as
the popular Saturday night competitions

216
00:17:32,495 --> 00:17:36,073
pushed good dances to greatness,
new steps were born every day.

217
00:17:36,143 --> 00:17:37,834
Lift! Yes, Mr. Keane.

218
00:17:38,575 --> 00:17:41,063
Very good. Good, Mr. Keane.

219
00:17:41,135 --> 00:17:43,022
When it looked
like it couldn't get any better,

220
00:17:43,087 --> 00:17:46,120
a young dancer
named Frankie "Musclehead" Manning

221
00:17:46,191 --> 00:17:50,315
created the first air steps,
and the lindy hop soared.

222
00:17:50,383 --> 00:17:53,100
One. This was 1935.
Two. The lindy hop became.

223
00:17:53,167 --> 00:17:56,036
Three. A dance craze worldwide.
Four. Known as the jitterbug.

224
00:17:56,111 --> 00:17:59,013
Five. But the authentic style.
Six. The original style.

225
00:17:59,087 --> 00:18:02,502
Seven. Will always be. Eight.

226
00:18:03,246 --> 00:18:07,021
The Savoy style from Harlem, USA.

227
00:18:07,119 --> 00:18:11,396
And rock step, triple step, rock step,
triple step, triple step.

228
00:18:11,438 --> 00:18:13,577
Everyone partner up.

229
00:18:17,839 --> 00:18:19,049
Can't dance.

230
00:18:19,726 --> 00:18:21,450
- Are you Lisa?
- Natasha.

231
00:18:23,406 --> 00:18:26,440
- Lisa?
- No. Linda Sue.

232
00:18:26,671 --> 00:18:29,191
- Are you Lisa?
- Sally Ann.

233
00:18:30,927 --> 00:18:32,007
I'm sorry.

234
00:18:33,678 --> 00:18:35,718
I'm sorry. I can't dance.

235
00:18:35,790 --> 00:18:36,739
Hi!

236
00:18:39,919 --> 00:18:41,479
Lisa? Are you Lisa?

237
00:18:41,998 --> 00:18:43,754
Where's Lisa? Are you...

238
00:18:48,302 --> 00:18:49,961
Are you Lisa? Lisa?

239
00:18:50,030 --> 00:18:52,997
Are you Lisa? Lisa?
Are you Lisa? Are you Lisa?

240
00:18:53,070 --> 00:18:54,979
Is your name Lisa?

241
00:18:55,054 --> 00:18:57,061
Are you Lisa? Are you Lisa? Lisa? Lisa?

242
00:18:57,134 --> 00:19:00,134
Lisa. Is your name Lisa? Where's Lisa?

243
00:19:01,998 --> 00:19:03,046
I'm sorry.

244
00:20:20,397 --> 00:20:22,252
Are you sure you're all right?

245
00:20:22,477 --> 00:20:23,459
Yeah.

246
00:20:23,981 --> 00:20:25,225
You look tired.

247
00:20:26,701 --> 00:20:27,944
I went dancing.

248
00:20:29,901 --> 00:20:31,428
- Yeah?
- Yeah.

249
00:20:33,037 --> 00:20:33,985
When?

250
00:20:35,372 --> 00:20:36,582
Before work.

251
00:20:40,172 --> 00:20:43,271
You went dancing earlier tonight
before work.

252
00:20:47,756 --> 00:20:48,803
Yeah.

253
00:20:50,925 --> 00:20:52,485
Well, did you have fun?

254
00:20:54,669 --> 00:20:55,749
No.

255
00:21:01,964 --> 00:21:03,687
She'd want you to, Frank.

256
00:21:06,316 --> 00:21:08,356
She'd want you to be happy, Frank.

257
00:21:10,476 --> 00:21:12,898
We have a lot of bread to bake before dawn.

258
00:21:17,548 --> 00:21:20,101
Right about... No, not here.

259
00:21:20,972 --> 00:21:21,920
All right.

260
00:21:21,996 --> 00:21:24,003
- There you go. Here. Got it?
- Got it.

261
00:22:10,795 --> 00:22:12,137
Morning, Baguette.

262
00:22:13,388 --> 00:22:14,762
Morning, Rita.

263
00:22:15,883 --> 00:22:16,963
Good dog.

264
00:22:18,379 --> 00:22:19,688
The usual, Frank?

265
00:22:21,227 --> 00:22:24,009
Your frequent buyer card.
For every 10 mugs you buy,

266
00:22:25,867 --> 00:22:29,129
- you get one free.
- Business has been off.

267
00:22:30,091 --> 00:22:31,039
Thanks.

268
00:22:31,339 --> 00:22:32,321
Bye.

269
00:22:34,922 --> 00:22:39,494
A lot of women have hair
on their upper lips.

270
00:22:40,459 --> 00:22:42,663
Janet had hair on her ass.

271
00:22:42,987 --> 00:22:44,165
Gabe, you're mad at her.

272
00:22:44,235 --> 00:22:47,234
You feel that she's abandoned you in death,
and you're very angry.

273
00:22:47,306 --> 00:22:50,176
Rafael, I tried to do what you said, okay?
Stay with the positive.

274
00:22:50,251 --> 00:22:52,672
But I keep coming back to the ass whiskers.

275
00:22:52,747 --> 00:22:54,438
Okay, Gabe, let's put a pin in that.

276
00:22:54,507 --> 00:22:58,336
Now, Kip, did I hear you say
that the odor went away?

277
00:23:00,075 --> 00:23:01,023
Yeah.

278
00:23:02,122 --> 00:23:04,162
- I put her rings back.
- Back?

279
00:23:04,682 --> 00:23:06,787
- In her drawer.
- Had you moved them?

280
00:23:07,114 --> 00:23:09,024
Only to the safety deposit box.

281
00:23:10,475 --> 00:23:12,198
And you think that upset her?

282
00:23:12,266 --> 00:23:14,983
Yeah, big time. The house stunk.

283
00:23:15,498 --> 00:23:18,215
You don't think she wanted you
to move her things.

284
00:23:18,378 --> 00:23:20,745
You think she's trying to control things?

285
00:23:22,346 --> 00:23:24,386
Yeah. You know, she was like that.

286
00:23:24,778 --> 00:23:25,793
Like what?

287
00:23:25,866 --> 00:23:29,281
Like you said. You know, controlling.

288
00:23:29,514 --> 00:23:32,416
And you think
she's carried over this behavior into death?

289
00:23:32,490 --> 00:23:33,438
Yeah.

290
00:23:33,770 --> 00:23:35,778
How does that make you feel, Kip?

291
00:23:36,842 --> 00:23:38,751
- Scared.
- Well, get over it, Kip.

292
00:23:39,050 --> 00:23:43,272
She's dead, okay? She's not coming back.
Not as a ghost, not as a stench.

293
00:23:43,562 --> 00:23:45,504
She left. She's gone.

294
00:23:45,961 --> 00:23:48,350
If the guy smelled her, he smelled her.

295
00:23:49,705 --> 00:23:51,844
- At least he loved her.
- And what's that supposed to mean?

296
00:23:51,914 --> 00:23:52,929
You figure it out.

297
00:23:53,002 --> 00:23:55,784
Hey, Matthew,
you have no idea what I feel, okay?

298
00:23:55,850 --> 00:23:57,759
I hear you bitching every week.

299
00:23:57,866 --> 00:23:59,240
Oh, here we go.

300
00:23:59,561 --> 00:24:03,358
Okay, we're putting our feelings
on the table here

301
00:24:03,434 --> 00:24:05,670
and we're challenging each other.

302
00:24:07,433 --> 00:24:08,775
It's hard to feel.

303
00:24:12,970 --> 00:24:14,017
It's so...

304
00:24:17,066 --> 00:24:19,335
It's so hard to...

305
00:24:22,761 --> 00:24:24,550
- I...
- Kip.

306
00:24:24,617 --> 00:24:25,565
Okay.

307
00:24:29,929 --> 00:24:31,391
Anyone else?

308
00:24:33,929 --> 00:24:35,238
Frank?

309
00:24:44,137 --> 00:24:45,762
I went to a dance class.

310
00:24:47,241 --> 00:24:50,951
Oh. Did you and Rita use to dance together?

311
00:24:52,329 --> 00:24:53,311
No.

312
00:24:54,281 --> 00:24:56,833
Then why a dance class?

313
00:24:57,512 --> 00:24:59,073
A man gave me a ticket.

314
00:25:01,448 --> 00:25:02,910
And did you enjoy it?

315
00:25:12,905 --> 00:25:13,853
Frank?

316
00:25:16,585 --> 00:25:19,105
- I don't think so.
- You don't think so.

317
00:25:21,512 --> 00:25:22,919
Something happened.

318
00:25:23,368 --> 00:25:25,539
- What happened, Frank?
- "What happened"?

319
00:25:25,672 --> 00:25:29,950
I'll tell you what happened.
The guy's wife is dead, and it hurts bad,

320
00:25:30,024 --> 00:25:34,302
like a knife in the gut that rips
a little bit more every time you move.

321
00:25:34,377 --> 00:25:38,632
I'm talking to Frank, Blake.
Frank, what happened at the dance class?

322
00:25:42,696 --> 00:25:43,645
I danced.

323
00:25:45,576 --> 00:25:46,918
You danced.

324
00:25:48,840 --> 00:25:50,978
Oh! Frank, what are you doing?

325
00:25:51,368 --> 00:25:54,237
Hey, hey, hey, hey.
You can scream and argue in here,

326
00:25:54,312 --> 00:25:57,694
you can cry and curse and carry on,
but you can't get out of your seat.

327
00:25:57,768 --> 00:25:59,328
Unless you have to pee.

328
00:26:01,960 --> 00:26:04,578
- What's going on, Frank?
- Are you okay, Frank?

329
00:26:07,208 --> 00:26:09,957
Frank, I know of no therapy that can work
unless you're willing

330
00:26:10,024 --> 00:26:13,253
to talk and to open up
and to face your demons.

331
00:26:14,280 --> 00:26:15,490
The lindy hop.

332
00:26:16,775 --> 00:26:18,597
- What'd he say?
- I don't know.

333
00:26:22,920 --> 00:26:27,491
The lindy hop got its name in 1927,
after Charles Lindbergh's flight to Paris

334
00:26:27,687 --> 00:26:31,462
when the newspapers proclaimed,
"Lindy Hops the Atlantic."

335
00:26:32,199 --> 00:26:33,693
I didn't know that, Frank.

336
00:26:34,248 --> 00:26:37,630
A-one, two, one, two, three.

337
00:26:38,247 --> 00:26:40,035
One, two, spin.

338
00:26:40,872 --> 00:26:45,094
One, two, one, two. One, two, spin.

339
00:26:47,399 --> 00:26:48,413
I'll tell you right now,

340
00:26:48,487 --> 00:26:52,317
if this turns into one of those
West Hollywood things, I am out of here.

341
00:26:53,703 --> 00:26:55,230
Yeah. Yeah.

342
00:26:59,366 --> 00:27:00,610
Two, three...

343
00:27:07,015 --> 00:27:08,837
- Hey, you called in?
- Yeah.

344
00:27:08,903 --> 00:27:10,594
- He a friend of yours, huh?
- No.

345
00:27:10,663 --> 00:27:12,518
- Then you just passing by?
- Yeah.

346
00:27:12,806 --> 00:27:14,628
Hey, hey, hey.
Hang two up in the truck, will you?

347
00:27:14,695 --> 00:27:16,221
- Got you.
- Two large bore, normal saline.

348
00:27:16,294 --> 00:27:19,458
- Is he gonna make it?
- His body was practically cut in two.

349
00:27:19,815 --> 00:27:22,116
Hey, hey, you the friend?

350
00:27:22,183 --> 00:27:23,263
- Yeah, he's right here.
- No...

351
00:27:23,334 --> 00:27:24,578
- Come here, come here.
- I'm not the friend.

352
00:27:24,646 --> 00:27:26,021
Just go talk to him, okay?
Just go talk to him.

353
00:27:26,087 --> 00:27:28,029
- I'm not the friend.
- Come here.

354
00:27:28,934 --> 00:27:29,883
There. Go.

355
00:27:31,366 --> 00:27:33,821
Keep him talking.
If he's talking, he's conscious.

356
00:27:33,894 --> 00:27:35,421
We need him conscious.

357
00:27:37,382 --> 00:27:38,909
It's the bread man.

358
00:27:40,326 --> 00:27:41,821
Hey, bread man.

359
00:27:42,663 --> 00:27:44,932
Did you ever look back at your life

360
00:27:45,639 --> 00:27:48,770
and think how it might have been different?

361
00:27:49,830 --> 00:27:52,994
- Yeah.
- It's a pity you only get one.

362
00:27:54,854 --> 00:27:56,545
Some guys get a great ride,

363
00:27:56,614 --> 00:28:00,672
but for most of us, you can't help but
wonder how it might have been different.

364
00:28:01,926 --> 00:28:03,136
I know. I know.

365
00:28:04,262 --> 00:28:06,750
Yeah, I believe you do,

366
00:28:07,014 --> 00:28:10,876
Mr. Son of the Son of the Son
of the Son of a Baker Man.

367
00:28:12,229 --> 00:28:13,953
Son of the son of the son.

368
00:28:15,526 --> 00:28:18,908
I reached my fork in the road
when my mom died.

369
00:28:20,646 --> 00:28:22,915
I could have gone right, but I went left.

370
00:28:22,982 --> 00:28:26,113
I spent the rest of my life wondering

371
00:28:27,302 --> 00:28:29,341
where that right might have led me.

372
00:28:30,342 --> 00:28:31,803
When did she die?

373
00:28:33,542 --> 00:28:35,265
1963.

374
00:28:37,765 --> 00:28:40,765
- A year after you punched that girl.
- Hey.

375
00:28:41,926 --> 00:28:44,893
I've done a lot of things in my life
I'm not proud of,

376
00:28:44,965 --> 00:28:47,714
and if you pin me down I'll own up to it,

377
00:28:49,317 --> 00:28:51,422
but hitting Lisa was an accident.

378
00:28:51,941 --> 00:28:52,889
Oh, I see.

379
00:28:53,221 --> 00:28:56,604
And Rodan could kick Godzilla's butt
any day, and you know it.

380
00:28:56,677 --> 00:29:00,026
No way. See, Godzilla is so big and strong,

381
00:29:00,101 --> 00:29:02,752
and Rodan just runs around
saying, "See, I'm a retard."

382
00:29:02,853 --> 00:29:03,900
Oh, no way.

383
00:29:03,973 --> 00:29:07,289
Oh, the only thing that Godzilla does
is blow, like, fire and stuff.

384
00:29:07,365 --> 00:29:10,147
Yeah, and he's got Mothra
and the little crab guy.

385
00:29:10,213 --> 00:29:12,253
What's Mothra gonna do,
eat a giant sweater?

386
00:29:12,325 --> 00:29:16,220
No, he blows smoke through his nose,
and whoever he touches he turns to ice.

387
00:29:16,421 --> 00:29:18,396
- Hi, Mr. Cranwinkle.
- Hi, Mr. Cranwinkle.

388
00:29:18,469 --> 00:29:20,192
Stay out of the roses.

389
00:29:20,325 --> 00:29:23,009
<i>We never really screwed up his roses.</i>

390
00:29:23,205 --> 00:29:26,140
<i>We only threw his lawn furniture in the pool
every once in a while.</i>

00:29:26,213 --> 00:29:27,489
Bye, boys.

<i>Cranwinkle was another real boner.</i>

393
00:29:31,812 --> 00:29:33,601
I nailed him.

At the Marilyn Hotchkiss Ballroom Dancing

395

your sons and daughters

will become the finest gentlemen
and young ladies.

397
00:29:44,421 --> 00:29:45,882
What is this?

398
00:29:45,956 --> 00:29:50,463
This could be your son or daughter.

402
00:30:05,636 --> 00:30:08,353
Etiquette, manner, grace.

403
00:30:08,420 --> 00:30:12,828
That is the real question. Can it be learned?

404
00:30:13,220 --> 00:30:15,424
<i>Father, please pass the au gratin potatoes.</i>

405
00:30:15,492 --> 00:30:16,801
What a geek!

406
00:30:17,860 --> 00:30:19,289
<i>Thank you, sir.</i>

407
00:30:19,364 --> 00:30:20,542
<i>You're welcome, Son.</i>

408

<i>May I have this dance, miss?</i>

410
00:30:24,388 --> 00:30:26,079
<i>I'd be enchanted, sir.</i>

411

At Hotchkiss, even one night of training

412
00:30:28,772 --> 00:30:31,357
can change your son or daughter forever.

413

Cotillions of a common thread

414

that separate the class
from the middle class.

415
00:30:40,100 --> 00:30:43,712
But can you stop my son from swearing?

416
00:30:44,548 --> 00:30:48,061
- I don't swear much.
- Sure you do, dickweed.

417
00:30:51,235 --> 00:30:53,145
The swing.

418
00:30:56,516 --> 00:30:59,712

It's a good thing our parents don't stink
enough to send us to that.

Ma, please don't make me go to this.
I promise. I'll change!

Why, Ma, why?

- Etiquette, Steven.

It's in my jacket. Where's my jacket?

- You take it.
- What?

443

You go in my place.

of the fifth year of the new millennium.

448
00:32:30,402 --> 00:32:33,566
We promised each other
that no matter what happened,

449
00:32:34,210 --> 00:32:35,671
we'd meet each other.

450

You go, please.
Tell her I tried. I wanted to be there.

Thank you.

I think we should all take this moment

455
00:34:29,345 --> 00:34:32,159
to recognize the progress that we've made

456

Well,

I cleaned out Rita's closet.

You toss it? Her clothes, everything?

00:34:57,792 --> 00:34:58,840
Yeah.

00:35:08,384 --> 00:35:12,824
I, myself, am a cleaner and not a preserver,

464
00:35:12,896 --> 00:35:15,416
and I say bravo, Frank, bravo.

465
00:35:19,264 --> 00:35:21,686
- Bravo.

For the rest of my life,

00:35:33,567 --> 00:35:36,982
I will be able to describe to you
the shape of the fillings

in Mia's teeth,

470
00:35:42,304 --> 00:35:44,158
but I didn't keep one memento.

471
00:35:47,487 --> 00:35:48,829
Not even her ring?

472
00:35:50,495 --> 00:35:52,567
- Not even her ring.
- Wow.

473
00:35:54,495 --> 00:35:55,804
And that's good?

474
00:35:57,215 --> 00:36:01,470
That's good? I mean,
you throw away your past and that's good?

475
00:36:05,535 --> 00:36:07,095
Frank, how do you feel?

476
00:36:14,655 --> 00:36:15,637

Well, what happened next, Steve?

479
00:36:33,471 --> 00:36:36,253
Did Peter have to go, too?

480
00:36:42,462 --> 00:36:46,619
Lisa. Lisa. Was Lisa there, Steve?
Was Lisa there?

481
00:36:49,343 --> 00:36:50,357
They were all there.

482
00:36:50,430 --> 00:36:52,219
- Good afternoon, girls.
- Good afternoon, ma'am.

483
00:36:52,286 --> 00:36:55,188
That's right. Sign right there.
You look lovely today.

484
00:36:55,263 --> 00:36:57,466
You look like a couple of princesses
or something.

485
00:36:57,535 --> 00:36:59,061
- Thank you.
- Thank you.

486
00:36:59,934 --> 00:37:02,301
Hello, young man. Just sign right there.

487
00:37:04,318 --> 00:37:05,844
- Stay on the line.
- Okay.

488
00:37:05,918 --> 00:37:06,867
Okay.

489
00:37:09,182 --> 00:37:12,117
Now, look at you.
Now, isn't it nice sometimes to dress up

490
00:37:12,190 --> 00:37:14,557
in a suit and a tie and a white shirt, huh?

491
00:37:15,262 --> 00:37:16,822
- Kind of.
- Yeah.

492
00:37:17,694 --> 00:37:18,643
Next.

493
00:37:21,182 --> 00:37:23,549
Oh, is your name on that list, young man?

494
00:37:24,573 --> 00:37:26,940
- All right, Steven.
- Steve.

495
00:37:27,550 --> 00:37:28,499
Steve.

496
00:37:29,629 --> 00:37:30,677
Thank you.

497
00:37:32,702 --> 00:37:34,262
Well, look at you.

498
00:37:52,765 --> 00:37:55,634
<i>Welcome, ladies and gentlemen,</i>

499
00:37:55,709 --> 00:37:59,451
<i>to the Marilyn Hotchkiss Ballroom Dancing
and Charm School.</i>

500
00:37:59,837 --> 00:38:01,975
<i>I am Miss Hotchkiss,</i>

501
00:38:02,237 --> 00:38:05,914
<i>your teacher, instructor, friend.</i>

502
00:38:06,589 --> 00:38:10,102
<i>Now, everyone, repeat after me.</i>

503
00:38:10,813 --> 00:38:15,253
<i>Good evening, Miss Hotchkiss.
How are you?</i>

504
00:38:16,093 --> 00:38:18,744
Good evening, Miss Hotchkiss.

505
00:38:18,813 --> 00:38:21,366
How are you?

506
00:38:21,437 --> 00:38:25,081
<i>Oh! Fine. Thank you.</i>

507
00:38:25,533 --> 00:38:28,021
<i>Now, shall we begin?</i>

508
00:38:31,133 --> 00:38:35,508
<i>Gentlemen on the blue line,
ladies on the pink line.</i>

509
00:38:35,933 --> 00:38:40,275
<i>In my class, you will learn
some of the latest dance steps:</i>

510
00:38:40,349 --> 00:38:44,211
<i>the waltz, the swing, the cha-cha-cha.</i>

511
00:38:44,316 --> 00:38:45,265
This sucks.

512
00:38:45,341 --> 00:38:48,919
<i>But tonight,
you will learn my favorite, the box step.</i>

513
00:38:48,989 --> 00:38:52,764
<i>And boys,
when we are serving punch to our ladies,</i>

514
00:38:52,829 --> 00:38:55,611
<i>be sure to keep your fingers out of the cup.</i>

515
00:38:55,676 --> 00:38:57,945
<i>It is very improper.</i>

516
00:38:58,012 --> 00:39:01,590
<i>And ladies, when the young gentlemen
ask you to dance,</i>

517
00:39:01,660 --> 00:39:03,897
<i>dance with them, even if you don't want to.</i>

518
00:39:03,964 --> 00:39:05,426
- Dickweed.
- Fart face.

519
00:39:05,500 --> 00:39:06,645
<i>It's only for two minutes.</i>

520
00:39:07,260 --> 00:39:09,846
Good evening. I am Miss Hotchkiss.
What is your name?

521
00:39:09,916 --> 00:39:11,988
- Eric.
- Nice to meet you, Eric.

522
00:39:12,092 --> 00:39:14,263
You have beautiful freckles.

523
00:39:14,300 --> 00:39:15,762
Good evening, sir.

524
00:39:21,340 --> 00:39:26,096
British bulldog!

525
00:39:34,588 --> 00:39:36,017
Dickweed!

526
00:39:38,940 --> 00:39:39,888
Yeah!

527
00:39:44,412 --> 00:39:45,841
Hit him!

528
00:39:52,700 --> 00:39:55,188
Sorry

529
00:39:55,259 --> 00:39:59,383
about your eye.

530
00:40:15,548 --> 00:40:18,166
Steven? Steven.

531
00:40:19,963 --> 00:40:22,832
Steve. Steve, not Steven.

532
00:40:24,027 --> 00:40:24,976
Oh.

533
00:40:25,243 --> 00:40:26,421
All right.

534
00:40:26,843 --> 00:40:28,916
- Good evening. What is your name?
- Glen.

535
00:40:28,987 --> 00:40:30,875
I am Miss Hotchkiss. Nice to see you.

536
00:40:30,939 --> 00:40:32,368
It's nice to meet you, Miss Hotchkiss.

537
00:40:32,443 --> 00:40:33,719
- Hello, Mike.
- Hello.

538
00:40:33,787 --> 00:40:34,736
Kenny.

539
00:40:41,435 --> 00:40:45,657
You will get your jacket and brassiere back
after the class.

540
00:41:01,979 --> 00:41:03,386
Just a minute, pal.

541
00:41:04,026 --> 00:41:07,288
Meredith, I am afraid, is off-limits.

542
00:41:08,987 --> 00:41:11,353
Frank Keane. And you are?

543
00:41:12,250 --> 00:41:13,777
Not interested.

544
00:41:31,002 --> 00:41:32,911
Thinks he's Michael Flatley.

545
00:41:34,618 --> 00:41:36,309
The Lord of the Dance.

546
00:41:39,834 --> 00:41:41,360
He's not even Irish.

547
00:41:47,738 --> 00:41:51,033
<i>Girls on the pink line, boys on the blue.</i>

548
00:41:55,418 --> 00:41:56,366
<i>Freeway?</i>

549
00:42:00,666 --> 00:42:04,888
<i>Welcome, everyone,
to Thursday Nights with Marilyn Hotchkiss.</i>

550
00:42:05,305 --> 00:42:09,266
<i>As my beloved mother, Marilyn,
cannot be here with us this evening,</i>

551
00:42:09,337 --> 00:42:13,298
<i>I will, with your permission
and by the grace of God,</i>

552
00:42:13,754 --> 00:42:16,142
<i>proudly conduct her class.</i>

553
00:42:19,897 --> 00:42:24,599
Mr. Keane?

554
00:42:26,298 --> 00:42:29,593
Would you like to assist me
in a brief demonstration of the lindy hop

555
00:42:29,657 --> 00:42:33,748
before we move on to the cha-cha-cha?

556
00:42:38,201 --> 00:42:39,149
Yes.

557
00:42:41,466 --> 00:42:42,643
Freeway.

558
00:42:42,713 --> 00:42:46,608
And, rock step, triple step, triple step,

559
00:42:46,713 --> 00:42:50,543
rock step, triple step, triple step, rock step.

560
00:42:50,681 --> 00:42:52,469
That's very good.

561
00:42:53,592 --> 00:42:56,048
All right. Again.

562
00:42:59,161 --> 00:43:01,168
Rock step, triple step, triple step,

563
00:43:01,272 --> 00:43:05,528
rock step, triple step, triple step, rock step.
Excellent, Mr. Keane.

564
00:43:07,065 --> 00:43:10,196
All right. Rock step, triple step, rock step,

565
00:43:10,265 --> 00:43:13,167
triple step, rock step, triple step.

566
00:43:13,241 --> 00:43:15,346
Triple step. Excellent.

567
00:43:16,985 --> 00:43:18,065
Very good.

568
00:44:16,151 --> 00:44:17,558
Mr. Keane!

569
00:44:25,111 --> 00:44:26,966
Mr. Keane, please.

570
00:44:33,720 --> 00:44:34,930
Mr. Keane.

571
00:44:40,792 --> 00:44:42,482
Mr. Keane, please.

572
00:44:42,551 --> 00:44:43,500
Sorry.

573
00:44:43,671 --> 00:44:45,581
I'm so sorry.

574
00:44:45,975 --> 00:44:47,568
- Meredith!
- Sorry.

575
00:44:47,639 --> 00:44:48,686
Mr. Keane.

576
00:44:51,319 --> 00:44:54,319
You are disrupting my class, Mr. Keane.

577
00:44:55,287 --> 00:44:56,367
Sorry, I...

578
00:44:58,199 --> 00:45:01,581
I don't know what happened.
I just felt something.

579
00:45:03,479 --> 00:45:04,657
I don't know what happened.

580
00:45:04,727 --> 00:45:09,462
Dance is a very powerful drug, Mr. Keane.

581
00:45:10,359 --> 00:45:14,483
If embraced judiciously,
it can exorcise demons,

582
00:45:14,551 --> 00:45:18,413
access deep-seated emotion
and color your life

583
00:45:18,487 --> 00:45:22,033
in joyous shades of brilliant magenta

584
00:45:22,103 --> 00:45:25,299
that you never knew existed.

585
00:45:27,479 --> 00:45:31,221
But one must shoulder its challenges

586
00:45:31,286 --> 00:45:35,541
with intrepid countenance
if one is ever to reap its rewards.

587
00:45:37,271 --> 00:45:39,637
Are you up to it, Mr. Keane?

588
00:45:42,743 --> 00:45:44,237
Yes, I am.

589
00:45:45,942 --> 00:45:47,436
Very well, then.

590
00:45:48,310 --> 00:45:51,310
Girls to the pink line, boys to the blue line.

591
00:45:51,383 --> 00:45:54,416
Let's dance. Freeway. And...

592
00:45:58,615 --> 00:45:59,694
Thank you.

593
00:46:01,847 --> 00:46:02,894
Hi.

594
00:46:05,686 --> 00:46:09,680
- I work over at the Flight Centre on...
- I bake bread.

595
00:46:09,750 --> 00:46:12,499
...Colorado. On Colorado.
- I bake bread.

596
00:46:16,214 --> 00:46:18,254
- Good night, Frank.
- Good night.

597
00:46:52,085 --> 00:46:54,158
Tough break, baker man.

598
00:47:05,237 --> 00:47:06,961
You really think he did it?

599
00:47:08,181 --> 00:47:10,091
Well, I don't have any proof, do I?

600
00:47:12,757 --> 00:47:13,902
Why?

601
00:47:15,093 --> 00:47:16,271
It's Meredith.

602
00:47:18,837 --> 00:47:20,747
You think she's his girlfriend?

603
00:47:21,749 --> 00:47:23,156
I think he hit her.

604
00:47:26,293 --> 00:47:28,813
Shit, man,
maybe you should find another class.

605
00:47:32,789 --> 00:47:34,131
Why not?

606
00:47:36,596 --> 00:47:38,419
Dance is powerful, Kip.

607
00:47:39,253 --> 00:47:42,417
I need to shoulder its challenges
with intrepid countenance

608
00:47:42,485 --> 00:47:43,946
if I'm gonna reap its rewards.

609
00:47:47,412 --> 00:47:48,460
What?

610
00:47:49,493 --> 00:47:52,111
Maybe we should have stayed in Pasadena.

611
00:47:52,597 --> 00:47:54,964
After Mom died, we moved to Dallas.

612
00:47:55,636 --> 00:47:58,091
My father couldn't stand it anymore.

613
00:48:01,172 --> 00:48:03,889
The memories, everywhere he looked.

614
00:48:04,917 --> 00:48:06,226
It's hard.

615
00:48:07,284 --> 00:48:08,713
The memories.

616
00:48:10,772 --> 00:48:12,944
You love them and you hate them.

617
00:48:13,013 --> 00:48:16,176
I was very angry with her for leaving me.

618
00:48:18,740 --> 00:48:21,009
I thought maybe she'd come back.

619
00:48:22,613 --> 00:48:24,205
But she never did.

620
00:48:24,532 --> 00:48:26,059
How did she die?

621
00:48:27,348 --> 00:48:28,875
- My wife?
- Your wife.

622
00:48:33,236 --> 00:48:34,926
She killed herself.

623
00:48:35,636 --> 00:48:38,003
- God, I'm sorry, man.
- Why?

624
00:48:42,516 --> 00:48:43,923
I don't know.

625
00:48:50,676 --> 00:48:54,320
I bet you never thought
your day would end up like this, huh?

626
00:48:54,484 --> 00:48:55,858
No, I didn't.

627
00:48:55,923 --> 00:48:59,371
You got bread in that truck back there?

628
00:49:00,148 --> 00:49:01,490
A few loaves.

629
00:49:02,099 --> 00:49:03,310
What kind?

630
00:49:03,380 --> 00:49:05,681
Twelve grain, French, Irish soda.

631
00:49:06,516 --> 00:49:09,418
Nothing better than the smell of fresh bread.

632
00:49:09,940 --> 00:49:10,922
Yeah.

633
00:49:10,995 --> 00:49:12,621
She hated it, huh?

634
00:49:14,548 --> 00:49:17,297
The lonely nights with you away at work.

635
00:49:17,363 --> 00:49:20,233
The menial effort of it all.

636
00:49:20,660 --> 00:49:23,726
The provincial notion of a family trade.

637
00:49:23,796 --> 00:49:26,217
I'd like to hear more of your story.

638
00:49:26,419 --> 00:49:29,354
Why? Too close for comfort?

639
00:49:31,571 --> 00:49:33,513
Because it's not about me.

640
00:49:38,163 --> 00:49:42,221
Steve, Lisa. Lisa.
You danced. You danced with Lisa.

641
00:49:43,603 --> 00:49:44,651
Lisa.

642
00:49:47,923 --> 00:49:51,468
First I had to learn how to greet her.

643
00:49:52,595 --> 00:49:56,392
Now, ladies and gentlemen,
let us practice our introductions.

644
00:49:57,267 --> 00:49:59,023
How do you do, miss?

645
00:49:59,187 --> 00:50:01,259
Fine, thank you. And you?

646
00:50:01,331 --> 00:50:03,022
How do you do, miss?

647
00:50:03,091 --> 00:50:04,781
Fine, thank you. And you?

648
00:50:04,851 --> 00:50:06,607
How do you do, miss?

649
00:50:06,675 --> 00:50:08,649
Fine, thank you. And you?

650
00:50:09,203 --> 00:50:12,072
- How do you do, miss?
- Fine, thank you! And you?

651
00:50:12,147 --> 00:50:13,707
Would you care to dance, miss?

652
00:50:13,778 --> 00:50:15,240
Would you care to dance, miss?

653
00:50:15,314 --> 00:50:16,809
Would you care to dance, miss?

654
00:50:16,882 --> 00:50:18,311
I'd be enchanted, sir.

655
00:50:18,386 --> 00:50:20,393
May I have this dance, miss?

656
00:50:20,883 --> 00:50:23,272
May I have this...
Do I have to do this again, Mrs. Hotchkiss?

657
00:50:23,346 --> 00:50:25,386
May I have this dance, miss?

658
00:50:25,650 --> 00:50:27,373
Please excuse me
for being so forthright, miss,

659
00:50:27,442 --> 00:50:29,809
but that is the most beautiful dress
that you are wearing.

660
00:50:30,450 --> 00:50:33,319
The waltz, ladies and gentlemen.

661
00:50:34,483 --> 00:50:35,660
Style,

662
00:50:36,370 --> 00:50:37,515
form,

663
00:50:38,258 --> 00:50:39,371
grace.

664
00:50:39,762 --> 00:50:42,697
Can it be learned? Yes, it can.

665
00:50:43,314 --> 00:50:45,802
Sy and I will now demonstrate.

666
00:50:50,898 --> 00:50:52,207
Cranwinkle?

667
00:50:54,162 --> 00:50:55,569
What a boner.

668
00:50:58,674 --> 00:51:01,194
May I have this dance, Miss Hotchkiss?

669
00:51:01,265 --> 00:51:04,494
I would be enchanted, Mr. Cranwinkle.

670
00:51:14,802 --> 00:51:17,519
Now, ladies and gentlemen, it's your turn.

671
00:51:19,890 --> 00:51:21,864
Oh, now, now, now.

672
00:51:22,353 --> 00:51:26,477
Mr. Cranwinkle, will you lead the gentlemen
in a large circle?

673
00:51:28,977 --> 00:51:32,589
And, ladies,
will you follow me in a small circle?

674
00:51:33,073 --> 00:51:34,666
Follow me, please.

675
00:51:34,737 --> 00:51:35,784
Boys.

676
00:51:36,882 --> 00:51:38,670
Oh, very nice.

677
00:51:38,769 --> 00:51:41,900
On your toes, ladies. Very quietly.

678
00:51:42,833 --> 00:51:44,688
Great big circle, now.

679
00:51:47,953 --> 00:51:49,327
Follow me, boys.

680
00:51:49,393 --> 00:51:52,808
And now let's combine circles.

681
00:51:53,265 --> 00:51:57,672
Smile. Think of the handsome gentleman
you're going to be dancing with.

682
00:51:57,745 --> 00:52:00,974
And round and round we go.

683
00:52:01,040 --> 00:52:02,601
And let's dance.

684
00:52:03,409 --> 00:52:05,514
Keep the back straight, boy.

685
00:52:06,673 --> 00:52:10,022
That's some shiner.
Steve sure hit you good, didn't he?

686
00:52:11,281 --> 00:52:14,663
Two, three, four.

687
00:52:14,736 --> 00:52:17,224
- I didn't mean to hit her, you know.
- Yeah, sure.

688
00:52:22,224 --> 00:52:25,094
May I have this dance, sir?

689
00:52:25,360 --> 00:52:26,669
I'll lead.

690
00:52:28,624 --> 00:52:29,769
Three,

691
00:52:31,056 --> 00:52:32,169
one,

692
00:52:33,744 --> 00:52:34,540
two.

693
00:52:52,912 --> 00:52:55,662
Morning, Rita. Morning, Baguette.

694
00:54:59,758 --> 00:55:02,954
Welcome to the Flight Centre.
We get you where you wanna go.

695
00:55:03,023 --> 00:55:04,517
Where do you wanna go?

696
00:55:04,591 --> 00:55:06,281
Hi. I'm looking for Meredith.

697
00:55:06,350 --> 00:55:08,358
She's on a break. Out back.

698
00:56:11,949 --> 00:56:12,931
Hi.

699
00:56:15,181 --> 00:56:16,195
Hey.

700
00:56:19,693 --> 00:56:21,351
Mind if I join you?

701
00:56:25,549 --> 00:56:26,825
Nice suit.

702
00:56:28,077 --> 00:56:29,287
Think so?

703
00:56:30,989 --> 00:56:32,037
Yeah.

704
00:56:46,893 --> 00:56:48,103
<i>Freeway.</i>

705
00:56:49,644 --> 00:56:53,867
<i>Welcome, everyone,
to Thursday Nights with Marilyn Hotchkiss.</i>

706
00:56:54,637 --> 00:56:58,019
<i>As my beloved mother, Marilyn,
cannot be here with us this evening,</i>

707
00:56:58,092 --> 00:57:02,664
<i>I will, with your permission
and by the grace of God,</i>

708
00:57:02,925 --> 00:57:04,780
<i>proudly conduct her class.</i>

709
00:57:04,845 --> 00:57:05,892
Amen.

710
00:57:06,924 --> 00:57:09,193
- Where's the mother?
- She's dead.

711
00:57:09,581 --> 00:57:11,850
<i>Tonight we have a new student.</i>

712
00:57:12,428 --> 00:57:14,883
<i>His name is Blake Rische.</i>

713
00:57:15,149 --> 00:57:17,036
<i>Welcome, Mr. Rische.</i>

714
00:57:18,828 --> 00:57:22,625
<i>Freeway, Nuestra Cancin, cut number dos.
Thank you.</i>

715
00:57:23,308 --> 00:57:24,256
Welcome.

716
00:57:24,620 --> 00:57:27,816
Tonight we are going to attempt
the merengue.

717
00:57:29,100 --> 00:57:30,048
Good.

718
00:57:31,564 --> 00:57:36,169
As many of you know, the merengue is the
national dance of the Dominican Republic.

719
00:57:36,620 --> 00:57:40,068
This popular dance originated with slaves,

720
00:57:40,396 --> 00:57:44,619
who were chained together
and therefore forced to drag one leg

721
00:57:44,684 --> 00:57:47,335
as they cut sugarcane to the beat of drums.

722
00:57:48,107 --> 00:57:49,668
Okay, let's begin.

723
00:57:49,740 --> 00:57:52,391
<i>Freeway, the merengue, s'il vous plat.</i>

724
00:57:53,707 --> 00:57:55,911
Mr. Rische, shall we?

725
00:57:58,732 --> 00:58:02,277
Five, six, seven,
and drag, together, drag, together.

726
00:58:02,347 --> 00:58:04,070
Back, together, back, together.

727
00:58:04,140 --> 00:58:05,896
Forward, together, forward, together.

728
00:58:05,964 --> 00:58:08,713
Turn in place, five, six, seven.

729
00:58:08,779 --> 00:58:10,852
And drag, together, drag, together.

730
00:58:10,924 --> 00:58:15,713
Drag, back, drag, back. Drag, forward,
drag, forward and around in place.

731
00:58:15,787 --> 00:58:18,242
Five, six, seven and drag.

732
00:58:24,172 --> 00:58:28,514
I do not tolerate tardiness
in any of my classes.

733
00:58:28,587 --> 00:58:32,515
If you cannot come on time,
please do not come at all.

734
00:58:33,164 --> 00:58:35,236
I couldn't get out of work, Miss Hotch.

735
00:58:39,659 --> 00:58:41,382
Good evening, Miss Morrison.

736
00:58:41,899 --> 00:58:42,848
Hi.

737
00:58:42,923 --> 00:58:44,297
Pink line, Miss Morrison.

738
00:58:55,563 --> 00:58:57,472
Blue line, Mr. Ipswitch.

739
00:59:04,267 --> 00:59:06,405
<i>Freeway, music, por favor.</i>

740
00:59:06,795 --> 00:59:09,184
Partner up, everyone. Let's dance.

741
00:59:15,978 --> 00:59:18,564
- May I have this dance, Miss Morrison?
- Yes, thank you.

742
00:59:29,451 --> 00:59:31,491
I'm sorry about your truck.

743
00:59:31,850 --> 00:59:33,541
You know about that?

744
00:59:41,546 --> 00:59:42,888
And switch.

745
00:59:51,434 --> 00:59:53,027
And seven, eight.

746
00:59:59,434 --> 01:00:00,775
And switch.

747
01:00:07,434 --> 01:00:08,896
Randall did it.

748
01:00:09,450 --> 01:00:10,562
Why?

749
01:00:11,562 --> 01:00:13,733
He has trouble expressing his feelings.

750
01:00:14,250 --> 01:00:15,810
Gets protective.

751
01:00:18,442 --> 01:00:22,402
His inability to express his emotions
overwhelms him with rage.

752
01:00:24,329 --> 01:00:26,336
He should get some therapy.

753
01:00:27,754 --> 01:00:28,932
You don't understand.

754
01:00:29,002 --> 01:00:30,311
And switch.

755
01:00:30,378 --> 01:00:31,938
Okay! You've got it.

756
01:00:32,585 --> 01:00:34,887
Drag that leg. Cut that cane.

757
01:00:44,393 --> 01:00:45,702
And switch.

758
01:00:51,337 --> 01:00:54,185
I know what you're thinking,
but Randall is not my boyfriend.

759
01:00:54,569 --> 01:00:55,779
He's not?

760
01:00:56,169 --> 01:00:57,860
He's my stepbrother.

761
01:01:00,073 --> 01:01:01,415
Stepbrother?

762
01:01:02,216 --> 01:01:03,809
It's complicated.

763
01:01:05,704 --> 01:01:07,014
And switch.

764
01:01:33,833 --> 01:01:35,142
And switch.

765
01:01:42,792 --> 01:01:45,247
Either way, he doesn't own you.

766
01:01:45,320 --> 01:01:46,880
And seven, eight.

767
01:01:47,368 --> 01:01:48,710
Pick your arms up.

768
01:01:49,128 --> 01:01:50,273
I know.

769
01:01:51,112 --> 01:01:52,290
Does he?

770
01:02:04,232 --> 01:02:07,548
Thank you, everyone.
I expect to see you all here next week.

771
01:02:07,624 --> 01:02:08,834
And until then,

772
01:02:08,904 --> 01:02:10,977
remember what Gene Kelly always said

773
01:02:11,048 --> 01:02:13,349
- and practice, practice, practice.
- Practice, practice, practice.

774
01:02:13,448 --> 01:02:14,725
Thank you.

775
01:02:18,472 --> 01:02:20,359
I warned you, baker man.

776
01:02:22,184 --> 01:02:24,769
- You, let's go.
- Mr. Ipswitch.

777
01:02:25,480 --> 01:02:27,236
For the last 72 years,

778
01:02:27,303 --> 01:02:31,842
my mother and I have maintained a policy
of zero tolerance for violence

779
01:02:32,007 --> 01:02:34,691
in all of our classes, without exception.

780
01:02:34,791 --> 01:02:36,166
Your mother.

781
01:02:36,551 --> 01:02:39,682
Your mother, your mother,
your mother, your mother.

782
01:02:44,935 --> 01:02:47,902
Go home, Mr. Ipswitch.

783
01:02:50,247 --> 01:02:52,581
Go home and don't ever come back.

784
01:03:01,159 --> 01:03:02,947
But I love this class.

785
01:03:03,880 --> 01:03:06,596
Well, you are not welcome here any longer.

786
01:03:19,463 --> 01:03:21,318
I didn't see it coming.

787
01:03:24,007 --> 01:03:25,600
But I should have.

788
01:03:27,719 --> 01:03:29,126
I don't know.

789
01:03:30,535 --> 01:03:32,390
Maybe I didn't want to.

790
01:03:34,215 --> 01:03:38,437
Maybe I was just too scared
or just too weak.

791
01:03:38,502 --> 01:03:41,634
Don't. Don't blame yourself.

792
01:03:44,199 --> 01:03:45,628
Anger is one thing,

793
01:03:45,703 --> 01:03:49,631
but guilt is a worthless emotion.

794
01:03:49,991 --> 01:03:51,681
It's not the guilt.

795
01:03:53,766 --> 01:03:55,457
It's the emptiness.

796
01:03:56,102 --> 01:03:57,379
Emptiness?

797
01:03:59,303 --> 01:04:00,644
I feel like

798
01:04:02,214 --> 01:04:03,589
I'm drifting

799
01:04:07,110 --> 01:04:11,649
in an endless, monotonous ocean,

800
01:04:14,278 --> 01:04:17,344
all my thoughts just blending together
like water.

801
01:04:18,022 --> 01:04:19,331
Water, huh?

802
01:04:20,102 --> 01:04:21,280
No form,

803
01:04:22,374 --> 01:04:24,796
no definition, no beginning, no end.

804
01:04:25,862 --> 01:04:27,138
Loss.

805
01:04:28,390 --> 01:04:29,884
Loneliness.

806
01:04:30,758 --> 01:04:32,481
Two old pals of mine.

807
01:04:33,382 --> 01:04:37,310
You see your whole world
just slipping away

808
01:04:38,502 --> 01:04:40,891
and you can't do anything about it.

809
01:04:41,830 --> 01:04:43,204
Or you don't.

810
01:04:45,158 --> 01:04:46,914
You know what you should do,

811
01:04:46,982 --> 01:04:50,429
but your mind screws with you

812
01:04:50,501 --> 01:04:54,363
and you wind up doing the wrong thing

813
01:04:56,677 --> 01:04:58,303
or nothing at all.

814
01:05:00,517 --> 01:05:03,038
Love's always a total mess.

815
01:05:06,181 --> 01:05:07,708
Maybe next time.

816
01:05:09,317 --> 01:05:10,528
Next time.

817
01:05:10,598 --> 01:05:12,572
Is there ever a next time?

818
01:05:13,285 --> 01:05:14,463
I hope so.

819
01:05:21,797 --> 01:05:22,877
So,

820
01:05:24,517 --> 01:05:26,143
you don't eat meat?

821
01:05:26,757 --> 01:05:27,772
No.

822
01:05:29,445 --> 01:05:32,445
I don't eat anything with a face.

823
01:05:32,837 --> 01:05:33,916
Right.

824
01:05:33,989 --> 01:05:37,306
Anything whose dying eyes
might plead with me

825
01:05:37,732 --> 01:05:40,634
as its life is extinguished
for my consumption.

826
01:05:41,861 --> 01:05:44,228
- Is bread all right?
- Bread's good.

827
01:05:47,844 --> 01:05:49,306
How's that lip?

828
01:05:50,437 --> 01:05:52,509
- A bit salty.
- Oh, I'm sorry.

829
01:05:54,149 --> 01:05:55,676
That's all right.

830
01:05:56,453 --> 01:05:57,794
I like salt.

831
01:06:02,181 --> 01:06:05,116
You're a good man.
How come you're not married?

832
01:06:08,068 --> 01:06:09,792
I was. She died.

833
01:06:11,492 --> 01:06:12,441
Oh.

834
01:06:13,508 --> 01:06:14,850
I'm sorry.

835
01:06:17,604 --> 01:06:18,782
Me, too.

836
01:06:21,604 --> 01:06:23,197
What was she like?

837
01:06:29,252 --> 01:06:30,714
I don't know.

838
01:06:33,604 --> 01:06:35,099
Thought I knew.

839
01:06:37,252 --> 01:06:38,942
Now I'm not so sure.

840
01:06:40,836 --> 01:06:42,941
That's the thing that always gets me.

841
01:06:43,011 --> 01:06:45,826
How much you don't know
the people you know.

842
01:06:47,204 --> 01:06:49,376
- Like Randall.
- Yeah.

843
01:06:54,596 --> 01:06:57,116
When we were kids, we had a motorboat.

844
01:06:57,540 --> 01:06:59,362
It was a fishing boat.

845
01:06:59,843 --> 01:07:03,618
But mostly, James, Randall's dad,
used it for drinking.

846
01:07:05,284 --> 01:07:07,423
If we were bad

847
01:07:09,380 --> 01:07:11,005
or just bothering him,

848
01:07:11,075 --> 01:07:14,392
he would throw us overboard
and chase us with the boat,

849
01:07:15,011 --> 01:07:17,597
telling us to move our worthless butts.

850
01:07:19,844 --> 01:07:21,404
How old were you?

851
01:07:22,627 --> 01:07:23,642
Six,

852
01:07:24,259 --> 01:07:27,074
- seven, eight.
- You must have been terrified.

853
01:07:27,235 --> 01:07:28,315
Yeah.

854
01:07:29,796 --> 01:07:32,251
A couple times, I almost drowned.

855
01:07:32,963 --> 01:07:34,785
What about your mother?

856
01:07:36,355 --> 01:07:38,014
She didn't know.

857
01:07:38,947 --> 01:07:40,769
She didn't wanna know.

858
01:07:43,843 --> 01:07:45,404
But with Randall...

859
01:07:48,099 --> 01:07:49,276
He just... He...

860
01:07:50,851 --> 01:07:52,345
He feels guilty,

861
01:07:53,027 --> 01:07:55,132
because he was older

862
01:07:56,323 --> 01:07:58,233
and it was his dad, and...

863
01:08:01,955 --> 01:08:04,344
He just... He couldn't protect me.

864
01:08:06,594 --> 01:08:08,798
He's not helping you, you know.

865
01:08:09,507 --> 01:08:10,620
Yeah.

866
01:08:13,410 --> 01:08:15,003
That's the sad part.

867
01:08:17,506 --> 01:08:19,067
It's sad for you both.

868
01:08:39,906 --> 01:08:41,794
Sorry about your eye.

869
01:09:03,554 --> 01:09:06,653
- Hotchkiss is a real cheese barf.
- Yeah.

870
01:09:07,842 --> 01:09:11,322
"Chesterfields, 21 great tobaccos
and 20 great smokes."

871
01:09:11,906 --> 01:09:13,695
"Winston taste as good

872
01:09:15,170 --> 01:09:17,057
"as a cigarette should."

873
01:09:21,890 --> 01:09:23,580
Do you like Marilyn Monroe?

874
01:09:23,649 --> 01:09:25,886
- I don't know. She's kind of old.
- Yeah.

875
01:09:25,954 --> 01:09:28,801
- But DiMaggio, he's cool, right?
- Oh, yeah.

876
01:09:31,298 --> 01:09:33,272
Suppose there was this guy,

877
01:09:34,305 --> 01:09:36,607
and this guy, he had a best friend,

878
01:09:37,377 --> 01:09:39,798
and he kind of liked a girl.

879
01:09:40,321 --> 01:09:43,136
- Would that make him a traitor?
- Oh, yeah. He'd be a rat.

880
01:09:43,201 --> 01:09:44,990
Yeah. Yeah, of course.

881
01:09:48,545 --> 01:09:50,454
I hate British bulldog.

882
01:09:50,593 --> 01:09:51,771
Me, too.

883
01:09:53,729 --> 01:09:55,485
- Kate?
- Lisa?

884
01:09:55,714 --> 01:09:57,502
Stop it, I'm serious.

885
01:09:59,137 --> 01:10:00,828
<i>Did you see John Glenn in Life?</i>

886
01:10:00,897 --> 01:10:02,490
Yeah, he's dreamy.

887
01:10:05,601 --> 01:10:07,488
I still kind of like boys.

888
01:10:09,345 --> 01:10:10,752
Yeah, me, too.

889
01:10:13,856 --> 01:10:15,766
I still kind of like Steve.

890
01:10:17,441 --> 01:10:19,580
I still kind of like Peter, too.

891
01:10:36,544 --> 01:10:39,261
Morning, Baguette. Miss those licks, buddy.

892
01:12:10,271 --> 01:12:11,383
Freeway.

893
01:12:11,775 --> 01:12:12,724
Wow.

894
01:12:13,503 --> 01:12:14,910
You go, girl.

895
01:12:20,287 --> 01:12:22,327
<i>Welcome, everyone,</i>

896
01:12:22,943 --> 01:12:27,002
<i>to Thursday Nights
with Marienne Hotchkiss.</i>

897

898
01:12:31,423 --> 01:12:32,830

899
01:12:33,343 --> 01:12:35,165
<i>Welcome, Mr. Kipling.</i>

01:12:53,534 --> 01:12:55,357
<i>And Cameron McGee.</i>

01:12:56,191 --> 01:12:58,166
<i>Welcome, Mr. McGee.</i>

908
01:13:01,310 --> 01:13:04,409
<i>Everybody got to dance with Lisa,

909
01:13:05,054 --> 01:13:06,396
<i>Even Dulin.</i>

910
01:13:08,862 --> 01:13:09,975
<i>Dulin!</i>

911
01:13:16,478 --> 01:13:17,907
One more time.

912
01:13:18,302 --> 01:13:21,019
- May I have this dance?
- Yes, thank you.

913
01:13:21,086 --> 01:13:23,639
<i>Eighteen rounds
of the circle choice method later,</i>

914
01:13:23,710 --> 01:13:25,849
<i>I found myself in front of Lisa.</i>

915
01:13:25,918 --> 01:13:27,805
<i>But I had nothing to say.</i>

916
01:13:28,414 --> 01:13:30,421
<i>Baseball trivia. No, no.</i>

917
01:13:31,454 --> 01:13:33,080
<i>I thought of something!</i>

918
01:13:33,150 --> 01:13:36,695
You know, with your eye,
you kind of look like the Tareyton man.

919
01:13:38,526 --> 01:13:42,454
<i>It was an obscure reference to cigarettes,
and she got it.</i>

920
01:13:42,910 --> 01:13:44,022
Sorry.

921
01:13:46,334 --> 01:13:48,887
- You know, you dance well.
- Thanks.

922
01:13:51,710 --> 01:13:54,645
Time to switch. Circle up. Let's dance.

923
01:14:05,502 --> 01:14:07,542
One more time.

924
01:14:08,701 --> 01:14:10,075
Take a hike.

925
01:14:11,229 --> 01:14:14,491
- May I have this dance, miss?
- I'd be enchanted, sir.

926
01:14:22,109 --> 01:14:25,884
All right, everyone. Let's partner up.
Let's dance.

927
01:14:32,669 --> 01:14:34,774
May I have this dance, Miss Morrison?

928
01:14:34,845 --> 01:14:36,984
I'd be enchanted, Mr. Keane.

929
01:14:56,477 --> 01:14:59,095
Two. That's it. One, two.

930
01:14:59,165 --> 01:15:02,264
The waltz is a beautiful thing,
Miss Hotchkiss.

931
01:15:04,380 --> 01:15:08,090
You may call me Marienne, Mr. Rische.

932
01:15:08,796 --> 01:15:11,218
And you can call me Blake, Marienne.

933
01:15:13,084 --> 01:15:14,808
Yes, perhaps I could.

934
01:15:30,268 --> 01:15:31,926
This was my place!

935
01:15:34,876 --> 01:15:36,370
I belonged here.

936
01:15:39,196 --> 01:15:40,570
I danced here.

937
01:15:40,700 --> 01:15:42,162
And I, unlike you,

938
01:15:42,876 --> 01:15:44,949
am a very, very good dancer.

939
01:15:45,436 --> 01:15:47,062
- You took that away from me.
- Stop that!

940
01:15:47,132 --> 01:15:48,506
My passion,

941
01:15:48,891 --> 01:15:50,201
my respect,

942
01:15:51,900 --> 01:15:53,144
all of it.

943
01:15:53,468 --> 01:15:55,355
And all because of you,

944
01:15:56,540 --> 01:15:59,987
I'm banned from the thing
that I love most in this world,

945
01:16:01,116 --> 01:16:02,578
my dance class.

946
01:16:04,507 --> 01:16:06,198
Now where do I go?

947
01:16:07,868 --> 01:16:09,013
Clubs?

948
01:16:10,236 --> 01:16:11,642
I hate clubs!

949
01:16:15,196 --> 01:16:16,919
Mr. Ipswitch, please.

950
01:16:25,756 --> 01:16:27,446
It's for your tires.

951
01:16:27,963 --> 01:16:29,654
That should cover it.

952
01:16:39,195 --> 01:16:40,689
Miss Hotchkiss,

953
01:16:43,100 --> 01:16:45,238
you look really good tonight.

954
01:16:52,795 --> 01:16:55,795
Very well, then. Let's dance.

955
01:16:59,419 --> 01:17:01,754
Look, I think I'll talk with him.

956
01:17:23,834 --> 01:17:25,176
Do you mind?

957
01:17:26,266 --> 01:17:27,859
It's a free world.

958
01:17:32,411 --> 01:17:34,320
Well, maybe not so free.

959
01:17:37,978 --> 01:17:40,345
I'm sorry if I stepped on your toes.

960
01:17:40,666 --> 01:17:42,095
Well, you did.

961
01:17:46,266 --> 01:17:48,121
I came here as a favor,

962
01:17:49,274 --> 01:17:51,282
to find a woman named Lisa

963
01:17:51,770 --> 01:17:53,330
and to give her a message
from another man.

964
01:17:53,402 --> 01:17:55,823
- There is no Lisa.
- I know. I never found her.

965
01:17:55,898 --> 01:17:59,281
- Well, I could have told you that.
- Yeah, but I did find something else.

966
01:18:02,298 --> 01:18:03,508
Meredith?

967
01:18:07,898 --> 01:18:09,392
Meredith, yeah.

968
01:18:11,258 --> 01:18:13,233
And, as Miss Hotchkiss put it,

969
01:18:14,586 --> 01:18:17,237
maybe even a way to exorcise my demons,

970
01:18:18,297 --> 01:18:20,752
access some deep-seated emotion

971
01:18:20,825 --> 01:18:24,403
and color my life in shades of magenta
I never knew existed.

972
01:18:26,393 --> 01:18:28,532
I get what dancing means to you, Randall.

973
01:18:29,338 --> 01:18:30,712
I really do.

974
01:18:32,890 --> 01:18:35,988
When I go back, I'll negotiate your return,

975
01:18:36,058 --> 01:18:37,967
but you gotta promise me one thing.

976
01:18:38,042 --> 01:18:40,693
You're never gonna hit Meredith ever again.

977
01:18:42,938 --> 01:18:44,181
Or me.

978
01:18:46,201 --> 01:18:47,761
Or anyone else.

979
01:18:51,257 --> 01:18:52,304
Okay.

980
01:18:55,993 --> 01:18:57,454
Okay, what?

981
01:18:58,041 --> 01:18:59,318
I promise.

982
01:19:03,001 --> 01:19:04,278
Take this.

983
01:19:06,041 --> 01:19:07,350
What is it?

984
01:19:08,537 --> 01:19:10,293
You paid me too much.

985
01:19:10,969 --> 01:19:13,140
I didn't get the steel-belted.

986
01:19:13,945 --> 01:19:15,668
Got the nylon plies.

987
01:19:17,241 --> 01:19:19,216
I got those on my Vette.

988
01:19:27,129 --> 01:19:28,438
Excuse me.

989
01:19:28,792 --> 01:19:31,127
Excuse me, Miss Hotchkiss. I'm sorry.

990
01:19:33,145 --> 01:19:35,054
Randall's told me he's sorry.

991
01:19:35,129 --> 01:19:36,722
He's made his peace.

992
01:19:36,793 --> 01:19:39,476
And now he wants to come back
to the class.

993
01:19:39,929 --> 01:19:41,685
Can we work this out?

994
01:19:42,776 --> 01:19:45,809
Do you have something to say to me,
Mr. Ipswitch?

995
01:19:51,992 --> 01:19:53,934
I'm sorry, Miss Hotchkiss.

996
01:19:55,224 --> 01:19:57,810
I'm sorry I brought my baggage to class.

997
01:19:58,264 --> 01:20:01,264
There are rules, Mr. Ipswitch,

998
01:20:02,456 --> 01:20:05,206
in life, just as there are rules in dance.

999
01:20:06,072 --> 01:20:09,934
Those rules may seem arbitrary at times,

1000
01:20:10,008 --> 01:20:12,244
they may seem impossible at times,

1001
01:20:12,312 --> 01:20:15,094
they may seem unfair or onerous,

1002
01:20:15,704 --> 01:20:18,519
but they are rules nonetheless.

1003
01:20:19,928 --> 01:20:22,033
And they must not be broken.

1004
01:20:22,680 --> 01:20:24,087
I understand.

1005
01:20:29,176 --> 01:20:31,565
Very well, then. Welcome back, Mr. Ipswitch.

1006
01:20:32,855 --> 01:20:35,222
<i>Freeway, music, s'il vous plat.</i>

1007
01:20:37,464 --> 01:20:38,707
Oh, hell.

1008
01:20:39,192 --> 01:20:41,680
For about two seconds there,
I was the BMOC.

1009
01:20:43,096 --> 01:20:45,943
- Let me lead you.
- However you want it, sweetheart.

1010
01:20:46,008 --> 01:20:50,317
One, two, three. One, two, three. One, two...

1011
01:20:51,928 --> 01:20:54,033
May I have this dance, ma'am?

1012
01:20:58,135 --> 01:21:00,110
I'd be enchanted, sir.

1013
01:21:06,392 --> 01:21:08,912
...two, three, four.

1014
01:21:08,983 --> 01:21:10,412
You dance well.

1015
01:21:10,487 --> 01:21:12,275
Thanks. So do you.

1016
01:21:13,143 --> 01:21:16,372
One, two, three. One, two, three.

1017
01:21:16,439 --> 01:21:18,643
- Divine.
- One, two, three.

1018
01:21:18,711 --> 01:21:21,559
One, two, three. One...

1019
01:21:23,127 --> 01:21:25,167
- Fart face.
- Dickweed.

1020
01:21:33,335 --> 01:21:34,829
I hate dancing.

1021
01:21:36,983 --> 01:21:38,805
I hate being charming.

1022
01:21:41,079 --> 01:21:42,508
Hate girls.

1023
01:21:43,382 --> 01:21:45,073
Hey, Karen, wait up.

1024
01:21:46,551 --> 01:21:48,209
They're not so bad.

1025
01:21:52,407 --> 01:21:54,000
You smell great.

1026
01:21:55,031 --> 01:21:56,405
Thanks, Kip.

1027
01:21:57,750 --> 01:22:01,329
I like to think of my smell
as a work in progress.

1028
01:22:23,574 --> 01:22:26,225
So you're like a dead wives club?

1029
01:22:26,710 --> 01:22:29,907
Well, I don't think
you could call it a club, per se.

1030
01:22:29,974 --> 01:22:31,916
But all of your wives are dead.

1031
01:22:31,990 --> 01:22:35,023
No, unfortunately for me,
mine is still alive and kicking.

1032
01:22:35,094 --> 01:22:37,069
Oh. That's okay.

1033
01:22:42,102 --> 01:22:45,363
Number eight. All right. Sign right here
and keep your name right on the line.

1034
01:22:45,429 --> 01:22:48,179
Oh, what a pretty signature you have.
Bye-bye.

1035
01:22:48,246 --> 01:22:50,286
Come on, you guys. Let's go.

1036
01:22:51,350 --> 01:22:52,942
My mom wants me to sign up.

1037
01:22:53,013 --> 01:22:54,420
Well, Peter?

1038
01:22:54,486 --> 01:22:56,340
My mom wants me to sign up, too.

1039
01:22:57,270 --> 01:22:59,953
- Yeah, mine, too.
- What a bunch of geeks.

1040
01:23:01,718 --> 01:23:04,849
There you go. Number nine. Right. Come on.

1041
01:23:27,125 --> 01:23:29,514
You're a good man, Frank Keane.

1042
01:23:30,965 --> 01:23:32,940
I did it as much for me as for Randall.

1043
01:23:35,477 --> 01:23:37,932
- One thing bothers me, though.
- What?

1044
01:23:39,253 --> 01:23:41,042
What color is magenta?

1045
01:23:45,077 --> 01:23:47,499
Reddish. Reddish purple.

1046
01:23:49,685 --> 01:23:51,954
- That clears that up, then.
- Yeah.

1047
01:23:58,869 --> 01:24:00,462
Well, did you like it?

1048
01:24:00,533 --> 01:24:02,060
No! Jeez Louise.

1049
01:24:03,477 --> 01:24:05,899
Well, did you sign up for next week?

1050
01:24:06,101 --> 01:24:09,265
Yeah, you wanted me to.
Gosh, Ma, what do you think?

1051
01:24:13,300 --> 01:24:16,148
- What are you sitting back there for?
- Just 'cause I want to.

1052
01:24:18,452 --> 01:24:22,576
<i>For the following 128 consecutive Fridays,</i>

1053
01:24:23,604 --> 01:24:26,124
<i>I didn't miss one minute of Hotchkiss.</i>

1054
01:24:30,196 --> 01:24:33,011
- May I have this dance, miss?
- I'd be enchanted, sir.

1055
01:24:33,076 --> 01:24:36,655
<i>McDonald's has sold billions and billions
of hamburgers by now.</i>

1056
01:24:36,725 --> 01:24:38,732
<i>Kenny Dulin, he's still a boner.</i>

1057
01:24:38,804 --> 01:24:40,909
- Enema booger lips.
- Broccoli butt breath.

1058
01:24:40,980 --> 01:24:42,573
<i>And I still swear a lot.</i>

1059
01:24:42,644 --> 01:24:45,065
<i>I've changed my mind
about one thing, though.</i>

1060
01:24:45,140 --> 01:24:46,350
<i>Girls.</i>

1061
01:24:46,644 --> 01:24:48,138
<i>But I still hate liver.</i>

1062
01:24:50,068 --> 01:24:51,661
6:00. You got it?

1063
01:24:53,172 --> 01:24:54,765
You'll go, right?

1064
01:24:54,996 --> 01:24:56,272
Steve,

1065
01:24:57,108 --> 01:24:58,995
what if she's not there?

1066
01:24:59,827 --> 01:25:01,682
She's gonna be there.

1067
01:25:02,868 --> 01:25:04,013
Man, the...

1068
01:25:07,828 --> 01:25:10,032
What should I say to her, Steve?

1069
01:25:13,492 --> 01:25:16,077
Steve, what do you want me to say?

1070
01:25:25,235 --> 01:25:26,511
He's gone.

1071
01:25:44,051 --> 01:25:47,215
If you're selling religion, go away.
I'm an atheist.

1072
01:25:47,507 --> 01:25:49,449
I'm not a salesman, ma'am.

1073
01:25:50,611 --> 01:25:52,334
Whatever you're selling, I don't want any.

1074
01:25:52,403 --> 01:25:56,015
I'm sorry to bother you.
I must have the wrong house.

1075
01:25:57,683 --> 01:25:59,570
Who you looking for?

1076
01:26:00,915 --> 01:26:02,889
- Lisa.
- Lisa who?

1077
01:26:05,331 --> 01:26:08,298
- Lisa Gobar.
- Yeah, that's me. What do you want?

1078
01:26:09,843 --> 01:26:11,053
Are you the Lisa Gobar

1079
01:26:11,122 --> 01:26:13,643
who went to the Marilyn Hotchkiss
Ballroom Dancing and Charm School

1080
01:26:13,715 --> 01:26:16,202
with a guy called Steve Mills in 1962?

1081
01:26:16,819 --> 01:26:19,950
How do you know
about the Marilyn Hotchkiss School?

1082
01:26:20,562 --> 01:26:21,969
The thing is,

1083
01:26:22,034 --> 01:26:25,351
you promised Steve Mills
that you would meet him

1084
01:26:26,515 --> 01:26:28,904
on the fifth day of the fifth month

1085
01:26:29,170 --> 01:26:31,537
of the fifth year of the new millennium,

1086
01:26:31,603 --> 01:26:32,912
and you were gonna meet him

1087
01:26:32,979 --> 01:26:35,662
at the Marilyn Hotchkiss
Ballroom Dancing and Charm School.

1088
01:26:36,050 --> 01:26:37,163
I did?

1089
01:26:40,338 --> 01:26:41,996
According to Steve.

1090
01:26:42,131 --> 01:26:45,164
Well, isn't that romantic?
What were we thinking?

1091
01:26:46,482 --> 01:26:49,449
That old bag Hotchkiss
must be long dead by now.

1092
01:26:50,771 --> 01:26:54,087
Her daughter, you know, Marienne,
she teaches class now.

1093
01:26:56,114 --> 01:26:57,194
Well,

1094
01:26:58,194 --> 01:27:00,017
guess I missed it, then.

1095
01:27:01,266 --> 01:27:03,339
Well, Steve...

1096
01:27:04,626 --> 01:27:06,284
Steve didn't make it, either.

1097
01:27:06,354 --> 01:27:08,809
He would have done anything to be there,

1098
01:27:10,386 --> 01:27:12,076
but he died on the way.

1099
01:27:13,009 --> 01:27:16,555
He just wanted you to know
that it was very important to him,

1100
01:27:17,105 --> 01:27:19,593
the promise that he made to you
all those years ago.

1101
01:27:20,337 --> 01:27:21,646
He was sorry to let you down.

1102
01:27:30,578 --> 01:27:31,854
Bye, Lisa.

1103
01:29:18,800 --> 01:29:21,189
I have to tell you that

1104
01:29:22,096 --> 01:29:24,006
- I haven't...
- It's okay. It's okay.

1105
01:29:24,112 --> 01:29:25,673
- I...
- It's okay.

1106
01:29:59,280 --> 01:30:00,709
You all right?

1107
01:30:01,167 --> 01:30:02,214
Yeah.

1108
01:30:02,479 --> 01:30:04,584
- I did something wrong.
- No.

1109
01:30:05,488 --> 01:30:07,081
- You sure?
- Yeah.

1110
01:30:09,999 --> 01:30:11,886
Then why are you crying?

1111
01:30:16,975 --> 01:30:20,171
'Cause I'm thinking
I get 65% off on all excursions

1112
01:30:20,239 --> 01:30:24,331
to the lberian Peninsula
between September 15th and November 1st,

1113
01:30:24,943 --> 01:30:27,332
and I never have anyone to go with.

1114
01:30:32,847 --> 01:30:34,472
I'll go with you.

1115
01:30:40,047 --> 01:30:41,770
Wait. That's Sampson.

1116
01:30:42,894 --> 01:30:43,909
Who?

1117
01:30:44,558 --> 01:30:46,380
- He'll be here in a minute.
- Who?

1118
01:30:46,447 --> 01:30:47,624
- The bathroom, quick.
- All right.

1119
01:30:47,694 --> 01:30:49,069
Hey, Frank.

1120
01:30:54,799 --> 01:30:56,173
Hey, Frank.

1121
01:30:56,750 --> 01:30:57,732
Hi.

1122
01:30:58,574 --> 01:31:00,298
What's going on here?

1123
01:31:00,782 --> 01:31:01,829
I...

1124
01:31:03,951 --> 01:31:05,412
I have company.

1125
01:31:06,894 --> 01:31:07,941
Here?

1126
01:31:11,023 --> 01:31:13,957
We were thinking
of making an Italian panettone.

1127
01:31:22,254 --> 01:31:24,042
I let Rita's ashes go.

1128
01:31:26,094 --> 01:31:27,206
Where?

1129
01:31:28,398 --> 01:31:30,089
Off Suicide Bridge.

1130
01:31:30,638 --> 01:31:32,361
Seemed appropriate.

1131
01:31:33,070 --> 01:31:35,077
Well, I bet she's happy to be out of that urn.

1132
01:31:35,150 --> 01:31:37,452
She never did like being confined.

1133
01:31:38,894 --> 01:31:39,941
Yeah.

1134
01:31:43,534 --> 01:31:45,388
Hi. I'm Sampson.

1135
01:31:46,286 --> 01:31:48,969
I heard you had a craving for a panettone.

1136
01:31:50,830 --> 01:31:53,961
Yes, I guess that I did.

1137
01:31:54,414 --> 01:31:57,097
Well, you've come to the right place, then.

1138
01:31:57,358 --> 01:31:58,918
This is Meredith.

1139
01:32:00,366 --> 01:32:02,340
Nice to meet you, Meredith.

1140
01:32:02,414 --> 01:32:03,941
I bet you're a dancer.

1141
01:32:04,589 --> 01:32:06,215
Oh, yeah, I guess.

1142
01:32:09,070 --> 01:32:10,346
It's fate.

1143
01:32:11,533 --> 01:32:13,126
Yeah, right, fate.

1144
01:32:13,293 --> 01:32:15,203
It... It's too perfect.

1145
01:32:16,269 --> 01:32:19,269
Nothing's perfect, Mills. Nothing.

1146
01:32:20,205 --> 01:32:23,140
They're gonna let me out of here
with 24 hours to spare.

1147
01:32:24,013 --> 01:32:26,763
If I drive straight through,
I can make it in by 3:00.

1148
01:32:27,757 --> 01:32:31,140
Gives me time to shower, shave,
score some clothes.

1149
01:32:33,677 --> 01:32:35,172
Couldn't be more perfect.

1150
01:32:35,245 --> 01:32:38,213
Yeah, but you're not allowed
to leave the state.

1151
01:32:38,797 --> 01:32:40,935
Did I ever tell you the story?

1152
01:32:41,197 --> 01:32:43,750
Only about 4,000 times.

1153
01:32:44,141 --> 01:32:48,364
And, man, let me tell you,
it is one boring fucking story.

1154
01:32:49,293 --> 01:32:50,373
What?

1155
01:32:50,765 --> 01:32:53,132
- 'Cause nobody gets shot?
- Or laid.

1156
01:32:53,389 --> 01:32:54,796
We made a pact

1157
01:32:57,036 --> 01:32:59,338
that no matter if we lost touch,

1158
01:32:59,820 --> 01:33:01,576
no matter if we got married...

1159
01:33:01,645 --> 01:33:04,906
Or if we got thrown in jail
for armed robbery.

1160
01:33:04,972 --> 01:33:06,882
No matter what happened,

1161
01:33:07,565 --> 01:33:10,881
we would meet
on the fifth day of the fifth month

1162
01:33:10,957 --> 01:33:13,739
of the fifth year of the new millennium

1163
01:33:13,805 --> 01:33:17,961
at Marilyn Hotchkiss'
Ballroom Dancing and Charm School.

1164
01:33:18,220 --> 01:33:21,122
Do you really think
that you made such an impact

1165
01:33:21,196 --> 01:33:25,353
that after 40 some-odd years,
some chick is gonna haul her ass

1166
01:33:25,581 --> 01:33:30,120
to Marilyn Hotchkiss' Ballroom Dancing
and Charm School just to see you?

1167
01:33:31,148 --> 01:33:32,163
Yes.

1168
01:33:32,428 --> 01:33:34,795
You were that good when you were 12?

1169
01:33:35,212 --> 01:33:36,838
I know. You watch.

1170
01:33:38,892 --> 01:33:40,997
When Lisa and I see each other,

1171
01:33:42,605 --> 01:33:45,157
all time will dissolve away between us.

1172
01:33:46,572 --> 01:33:48,808
It'll be a new beginning for me.

1173
01:33:51,020 --> 01:33:52,296
A fresh start.
