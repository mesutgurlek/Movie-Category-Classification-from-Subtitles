in the temple himself. - Okay.

Wow! lt's a beautiful tune!
Who's made it?

89

A guy named John who
works in our estate.

90

He hums this tune every morning.

91

l've been hearing it since childhood.

92
00:07:20,553 --> 00:07:23,613
Now it feels like it won't be morning
if John doesn't play this tune.

94

vineyards in the world.

We make some of the best wines.

''Hey Kamini, look down.
That's our brewery.''

119

our seeding plant.

''And in a while, you'll come across
Mother Kali's temple.''

122

My mother is building it for me.

''
Why are you so quiet, sweetheart?''

Don't be tensed. l'm a fantastic
pilot. l'm safe.

125
00:09:52,772 --> 00:09:57,368
You must be thinking about how my
mom will react when she sees you.

126
00:09:58,278 --> 00:10:00,303
Find out once we reach home!

127
00:10:00,446 --> 00:10:02,812
She will love you a lot.

Daughter-in-law is suffering
from cold!

131
00:10:09,856 --> 00:10:11,050
Call the doctor immediately!

132
00:10:12,725 --> 00:10:14,716
She isn't aware that the
daughter-in-law's..

133
00:10:14,794 --> 00:10:17,228
..do not like interference
these days! lsn't it?

134

Oh! What happened to this?

135
00:10:30,076 --> 00:10:31,134
Oh..

136
00:10:33,813 --> 00:10:36,008
The fuel..

137
00:10:40,053 --> 00:10:42,317
''Kamini, wear the parachute
behind your seat.''

138
00:10:43,890 --> 00:10:45,824
l've already worn the parachute.
- Good.

139
00:10:47,360 --> 00:10:48,827
Oh no. We're losing
height very fast..

140
00:10:49,228 --> 00:10:51,025
''Kamini, don't worry,
nothing will happen.''

141
00:10:51,164 --> 00:10:53,132
l'll not let anything happen to you.

142
00:11:03,509 --> 00:11:05,943
''Kamini, there's one more
parachute behind my seat.''

143
00:11:06,112 --> 00:11:07,170
Hand it to me quickly.

144
00:11:07,313 --> 00:11:10,942
Your parachute is lying
exactly where l threw it.

145
00:11:13,386 --> 00:11:14,444
''What kind of ajoke
is this, Kamini?!''

146
00:11:14,854 --> 00:11:15,912
Where's the parachute?!

147
00:11:16,856 --> 00:11:17,948
Oh no!

148
00:11:19,192 --> 00:11:21,217
Don't waste more time on this.

149
00:11:21,961 --> 00:11:23,792
When you were checking
the safe in the alder..

150
00:11:23,863 --> 00:11:25,854
..l disabled the fuel gauge.

151
00:11:25,932 --> 00:11:28,059
The plane is about to crash soon.
- What?!

152
00:11:28,801 --> 00:11:33,033
''l'll miss you, my love.
- Kamini! Kamini!''

153
00:12:57,356 --> 00:12:59,881
There was just one parachute

No. This can't happen.

Such injustice can't happen.

163
00:13:47,340 --> 00:13:49,535
You can't go leaving me behind.

you would come back.

my son away from me?!''

Monty. - So you feigned the
name along with his get-up!

God gave me a face similar
to him and l got..

279

..a lot of suggestions to keep
Monty as my name and l kept it.

280
00:24:21,840 --> 00:24:23,774
You aren't ashamed of
taking advantage..

282

..and would be standing here.

288
00:24:44,096 --> 00:24:49,329
You couldn't have been Monty
even with ten breaks!

289
00:24:49,535 --> 00:24:52,368
You seem to be a big fan of his!
Have you ever met him?

290

Will you please shut up?!

There's still some time

years in a village in lndia.

A five-year-old child

..from Ramayan and
Geeta in Sanskrit.

428

that's it.''

''Monty, you're going on a
holiday from tomorrow.''

443
00:42:44,375 --> 00:42:47,469
And l'll see who stops you.

444
00:42:48,045 --> 00:42:52,414
''No, mom, no place can soothe
me without my music.''

l wanted to meet your guardian
to talk about this.

She'll slap you the moment

l was born here but l'm
a true lndian at heart.

482
00:47:20,718 --> 00:47:23,551
That means you don't love
me. lt's useless.

483
00:47:23,754 --> 00:47:27,190
We can get married.
- What was l saying all along?

484
00:47:27,258 --> 00:47:29,249
You were talking about
a live-in relationship.

485
00:47:29,560 --> 00:47:33,052
Every relationship after marriage
is a live-in relationship!

486
00:47:34,565 --> 00:47:36,533
And since you've already proposed..

487
00:47:36,600 --> 00:47:38,727
..l might as well talk
to your guardian.

488

''You'll have to talk to
uncle Kabir, not her.''

489
00:47:43,073 --> 00:47:44,097
Who's uncle Kabir?

490
00:47:44,775 --> 00:47:47,573
He stays at Cape Town and
visits me every weekend.

491
00:47:47,778 --> 00:47:50,110
He's a huge fan of Hindi film songs.

492
00:47:58,923 --> 00:48:00,823
What is it? Who are you?

493
00:48:05,996 --> 00:48:09,432
Hey fool! Forgot who l am?!

494
00:48:10,868 --> 00:48:13,837

''Shakal, Mogambo, tell me
everything about him.''

00:48:17,975 --> 00:48:20,842

''

498

''

Tell me what l should do.

''l'll give you three minutes,
not a day.''

507
00:49:02,686 --> 00:49:07,089
There's a pawn shop there. Pawn
yourself if the need arises.

508
00:49:08,025 --> 00:49:12,485
Or else Mogambo and
Shakal will kill you.

509
00:49:16,500 --> 00:49:17,660
Go.

510

511

514
00:49:32,650 --> 00:49:34,845
Then l would have sold you too!

''
Kabira, you care a lot about Tina.''

516
00:49:42,426 --> 00:49:44,917
Not even real parents care so much.

517
00:49:45,963 --> 00:49:48,796
Tina's no doubt my late friend
Mahesh's daughter..

518
00:49:48,866 --> 00:49:51,926
..but l love her more
than l love my family.

519
00:49:52,002 --> 00:49:56,803
''Oh little one, what kind
of relationships..''

520
00:49:56,874 --> 00:50:00,401
..and emotions are these?

521

''

''

''Fun, laughter, smartness..
l cry when l think of them.''

526
00:50:18,329 --> 00:50:21,355
How long will my daughters
remain unmarried?

527
00:50:21,498 --> 00:50:24,228
Everything will be fine.
Have patience.

528
00:50:24,301 --> 00:50:28,567
Patience! Patience! You keep
postponing it by saying this.

529

Who's Patience? lntroduce me to him.

530

l'll make him my live-in son-in-law.

531
00:50:34,378 --> 00:50:35,538
Patience! Patience!

532
00:50:35,846 --> 00:50:40,510
''By the way, how about Tina's studies?
- Excellent!''

533
00:50:40,584 --> 00:50:42,848
She's the best cook at our college.

534
00:50:42,920 --> 00:50:45,889
She prepares delicious food!
People drool over it!

535
00:50:46,190 --> 00:50:48,852
''My daughters cook too,
but l am searching..''

536
00:50:48,926 --> 00:50:50,985
..for a guy to eat their food.

537
00:50:51,061 --> 00:50:53,188
Whom do they feed? They
eat it themselves!

538
00:50:53,330 --> 00:50:56,094
Tina's not to be seen. Where is she?

539
00:50:56,166 --> 00:50:57,258
She hasn't come to college today.

540
00:50:57,568 --> 00:51:00,332
She's not been here
for 15 to 20 days.

541
00:51:00,404 --> 00:51:03,168
15 to 20 days?!
- But she's a nice girl.

542
00:51:03,974 --> 00:51:07,137
One should keep an eye on girls
at this age. - That's right.

543
00:51:07,211 --> 00:51:09,406
l too keep an eye on my daughters!

544
00:51:10,114 --> 00:51:12,605
But there has to be someone
to keep an eye on..

545
00:51:12,916 --> 00:51:15,077
Whom should l keep an eye
on and what's the use?

546
00:51:26,296 --> 00:51:30,790
''Monty, what if uncle
Kabir rejects you?''

547
00:51:31,935 --> 00:51:35,302
''
lf he does that, we will elope!''

548
00:51:45,616 --> 00:51:50,280
You respect elders all the time
or is this the first time?

549
00:51:50,788 --> 00:51:52,312
''To tell you the truth, l'm doing
it for the first time.''

550
00:51:52,589 --> 00:51:57,652
Trying to impress me?
- No.

551
00:51:58,595 --> 00:52:00,187
l didn't have anybody to care
for me since childhood.

552
00:52:00,898 --> 00:52:06,336
And those who supported me aren't
even worth talking about.

553
00:52:07,938 --> 00:52:12,238
Do you know how the girl
you love leads her life?

554
00:52:13,610 --> 00:52:16,636
l've made her every wish
or desire a reality.

555
00:52:17,114 --> 00:52:19,639
She thinks that money
is of no concern.

556
00:52:23,954 --> 00:52:26,616
Kamal Kapoor had said that in
the film 'Chor Machaye Shor'..

557
00:52:26,690 --> 00:52:27,748
..when Shashi Kapoor goes to talk..

..about his marriage with Mumtaz.

559
00:52:33,363 --> 00:52:35,923
''But here, the situation
is exactly the opposite.''

560
00:52:36,166 --> 00:52:39,363
You're such great rock star
and my daughter is a nobody.

561
00:52:40,237 --> 00:52:41,864
l was confused since morning..

562
00:52:41,939 --> 00:52:44,999
..about the questions
l wanted to ask you.

563
00:52:46,043 --> 00:52:47,874
''Uncle Kabir, the situation
was similar in 'Bobby'..''

564
00:52:47,945 --> 00:52:49,003
..when Rishi Kapoor goes to
talk about his marriage..

565
00:52:49,079 --> 00:52:50,410
..with Dimple Kapadia.

566
00:52:51,315 --> 00:52:56,412
Oh my! That's true! How
did l forget that?!

567
00:52:56,887 --> 00:52:58,286
l've watched Bobby 15 times!

568
00:52:58,455 --> 00:53:00,923
''Why didn't you two remind me?!
- Sorry, sir.''

569
00:53:01,358 --> 00:53:04,885
You too watch a lot of
Hindi films..

570
00:53:04,962 --> 00:53:07,157
..and hence could defeat me!

571
00:53:08,632 --> 00:53:11,624
''Look, son, l've experienced
a lot in life.''

572
00:53:12,302 --> 00:53:15,294
A person's eyes say a lot about him.

573
00:53:15,939 --> 00:53:17,167
l have only one request to make.

574
00:53:17,574 --> 00:53:21,943
This girl doesn't have anyone
except me. Never hurt her.

575

lt's my own. My inner voice!

Who stays in that palace?

631
00:59:21,972 --> 00:59:23,701
The Verma family used
to live there once.

632
00:59:24,007 --> 00:59:25,201
Now Princess Kamini occupies it.

633
00:59:31,348 --> 00:59:34,317
And this estate?
- lt belongs to Sir Juda.

634

He's a very famous business tycoon.

lt once belonged to the
Verma family's son..

l want to introduce you to someone.

654

But unfortunately they are
nowhere to be found today.

studying in this college itself!''

Oh! Good evening.

737

now it's getting serious.

We won't meet henceforth. Goodbye.

There's love in your eyes.

''Hey, don't make fun of me.
l wrote these just like that.''

949

l shall give up myself
for your love.

l shall give up myself for your love.

953
01:31:26,379 --> 01:31:27,710
Who are you?

954
01:31:28,715 --> 01:31:32,947
''My husband, Ravi Verma, had written
the song you just sang.''

955
01:31:33,954 --> 01:31:37,890
How could you sing it?
- lt just came out from within.

956
01:31:38,925 --> 01:31:41,689
What do you want?! What do you want?!

957
01:31:41,761 --> 01:31:43,126
''
l love you, Kamini.''

958
01:31:43,897 --> 01:31:48,129
Are you nuts? There's a huge
age difference between us.

959
01:31:48,735 --> 01:31:53,138
''
For me, you're very beautiful.''

960
01:31:55,475 --> 01:31:56,601
Age and other hazards
of relationships..

961
01:31:56,676 --> 01:31:58,143
..can't stop me from loving you.

962
01:32:00,480 --> 01:32:04,473
The love that could even defy death..

963
01:32:05,986 --> 01:32:07,817
''
Kamini, l'm Ravi Verma.''

964
01:32:10,824 --> 01:32:12,052
Your Ravi Verma.

965
01:32:13,927 --> 01:32:18,159
l had a rebirth because of my
extreme love and your patience.

966
01:32:22,502 --> 01:32:27,496
That's nonsense! l don't believe
in rebirths! You're a liar!

967
01:32:28,708 --> 01:32:30,505
''
What proof do you want, Kamini?!''

968
01:32:31,011 --> 01:32:32,842
You have bed tea before
brushing in the morning.

969
01:32:32,912 --> 01:32:35,881
You get acidity if you don't get
your breakfast before 10am.

970
01:32:35,949 --> 01:32:37,883
You hate those who drink coffee.

971
01:32:37,951 --> 01:32:40,681
You can't tolerate cigarettes
and smokers.

972
01:32:40,754 --> 01:32:44,087
''Come on, Monty! Anybody can
find these things out.''

973
01:32:45,058 --> 01:32:47,458
''Okay, l'll tell you something
that only you..''

974
01:32:47,527 --> 01:32:49,859
''
..or your husband, Ravi Verma, knew.''

975
01:32:50,630 --> 01:32:53,190
You close your eyes while kissing.

976
01:32:54,801 --> 01:32:55,927
On your wedding night..

977
01:33:28,101 --> 01:33:30,661
Would you still say that
l'm not Ravi Verma?

978
01:33:36,042 --> 01:33:42,038
No. Only Ravi Verma can
know these things.

979
01:33:46,686 --> 01:33:48,677
''You don't know how much
l love you, Kamini.''

980
01:33:51,091 --> 01:33:54,686
l remember each and every
moment spent with you.

981
01:33:56,796 --> 01:33:58,661
l remember all our conversations.

982
01:34:02,869 --> 01:34:05,667
The only thing l cannot
recollect is my accident.

983
01:34:08,108 --> 01:34:12,272
l just remember that we were
travelling in the plane together.

984
01:34:14,047 --> 01:34:18,108
Then l remember that the plane
was rushing towards land..

985
01:34:22,155 --> 01:34:24,953
And then the plane
crashed and l died..

986
01:34:33,900 --> 01:34:35,868
Can you tell me how
this accident took place?

987
01:34:46,146 --> 01:34:48,637
''
Tell me, Kamini. Tell me.''

988
01:34:53,186 --> 01:34:57,987
l shudder when l think of that day.

989
01:34:58,925 --> 01:35:03,055
''We were on our way
to meet your, mother.''

990
01:35:03,797 --> 01:35:06,789
Suddenly there was some
problem with the plane.

991
01:35:10,670 --> 01:35:12,297
You told me to wear my parachute.

992
01:35:12,672 --> 01:35:14,071
l had already worn my parachute.

993
01:35:15,008 --> 01:35:16,669
And then you asked me to jump!

994
01:35:17,877 --> 01:35:20,607
When l asked about your parachute..

995
01:35:20,680 --> 01:35:23,843
..you told me that the
plane had just one.

996
01:35:23,917 --> 01:35:25,077
There's one more parachute
behind my seat.

997
01:35:25,151 --> 01:35:26,277
Hand it to me quickly.

998
01:35:26,953 --> 01:35:28,853
l refused to jump.

999
01:35:29,189 --> 01:35:30,349
''
l'll miss you, my love.''

1000
01:35:32,125 --> 01:35:35,686
You pushed me out of
the plane by force..

1001
01:35:35,762 --> 01:35:36,820
Kamini!

1002
01:35:39,799 --> 01:35:44,827
And l saw you dying before me..

1003
01:35:45,972 --> 01:35:53,140
l couldn't do anything!
l couldn't do anything!

1004
01:35:54,814 --> 01:35:59,911
''Calm down, Kamini.
l'm here because of your love.''

1005
01:36:02,222 --> 01:36:06,352
Where is my mom and sister?

1006
01:36:09,996 --> 01:36:16,128
Your mom stopped talking
out of shock.

1007
01:36:17,270 --> 01:36:20,671
Doctors advised to take
her away from this place..

1008
01:36:20,740 --> 01:36:24,733
..so that she could overcome
the shock of your death.

1009
01:36:26,012 --> 01:36:27,980
l sent mother and Jyoti to lndia.

1010
01:36:29,015 --> 01:36:33,247
But mother died in a few days.

1011
01:36:35,088 --> 01:36:36,385
Jyoti got married.

1012
01:36:38,024 --> 01:36:44,429
But she and her husband died in
a car accident within a few days.

1013
01:37:02,282 --> 01:37:03,772
What was the need to come home?

1014
01:37:04,050 --> 01:37:05,779
You could have spent the
night at the palace.

1015
01:37:08,121 --> 01:37:12,922
''Uncle Kabir, Tina, l'll explain
everything at the right time.''

1016
01:37:12,992 --> 01:37:14,050
What will you explain?

1017
01:37:14,794 --> 01:37:19,458
That you love a woman
twice your age?

1018
01:37:20,266 --> 01:37:22,860
Didn't you think of Tina even once?

1019
01:37:23,770 --> 01:37:27,570
''l've come across many silly people,
but none like you.''

1020
01:37:28,408 --> 01:37:32,071
You'd be stunned if l tell you
the truth about that lady..

1021
01:37:32,579 --> 01:37:35,571
..for whom you broke up with Tina.

1022
01:37:36,683 --> 01:37:38,082
What do you know about Princess?

1023
01:37:38,585 --> 01:37:40,246
She's a witch. Not some princess!

1024
01:37:42,855 --> 01:37:47,019
She destroyed the Verma family.

1025
01:37:47,594 --> 01:37:51,086
She was Ravi Verma's
wife and now she's..

1026
01:37:51,598 --> 01:37:55,193
..a concubine of an international
criminal named Sir Juda.

1027
01:37:55,868 --> 01:37:57,733
''
How do you know this, uncle Kabir?''

1028
01:38:01,708 --> 01:38:06,941
l haven't even told Tina what
l'm going to tell you today.

1029
01:38:09,749 --> 01:38:14,982
''Tina's father, Mahesh, worked
as a driver at Kamini's house.''

1030
01:38:16,122 --> 01:38:17,612
He was a very good friend of mine.

1031
01:38:18,324 --> 01:38:22,522
There was a loud bang
on my door one night..

1032
01:38:22,595 --> 01:38:28,693
Kabira! Kabira! Kabira!
- Mahesh!

1033
01:38:29,202 --> 01:38:31,864
What happened? Who did this?

1034
01:38:32,639 --> 01:38:33,936
''
l'm going to die, Kabira.''

1035
01:38:35,642 --> 01:38:37,303
Take care of my daughter.

1036
01:38:38,211 --> 01:38:40,304
Tell me who shot you?!

1037
01:38:41,614 --> 01:38:43,548
l had been to Kamini's house..
- Yes.

1038
01:38:45,184 --> 01:38:49,314
l overheard their conversation.
Mac saw me..

1039
01:38:49,789 --> 01:38:51,654
He was the one who shot me..

1040
01:38:52,158 --> 01:38:55,753
What were they talking about?
Tell me.

1041
01:38:56,929 --> 01:38:59,659
Goddess Kali's temple..
- Goddess Kali's temple?!

1042
01:39:00,600 --> 01:39:03,330
Than - Ravi Verma..

1043
01:39:07,140 --> 01:39:09,108
Mahesh?!

1044
01:39:10,810 --> 01:39:14,337
l didn't inform the police as
l was worried about Tina.

1045
01:39:15,515 --> 01:39:19,178
l didn't have much work then..

1046
01:39:19,252 --> 01:39:22,244
..so l went to Sir Juda and
Kamini's house the next day.

1047
01:39:22,321 --> 01:39:28,692
Oh! So Mahesh told you everything
before his death.

1048
01:39:29,195 --> 01:39:35,100
Yes. At Goddess Kali's temple..
- Enough! No need to go further.

1049
01:39:36,703 --> 01:39:39,797
How much money do you want?
- We don't deal in such things.

1050
01:39:40,973 --> 01:39:43,134
''Because of you, an innocent
girl became an orphan.''

1051
01:39:44,844 --> 01:39:47,711
You'll bring her up like
her mother would.

1052
01:39:48,281 --> 01:39:51,216
''And yes, if something
happens to us..''

1053
01:39:51,718 --> 01:39:54,186
..this secret will be
revealed to the police.

1054
01:39:54,987 --> 01:39:57,114
l've made sure this happens.

1055
01:39:59,826 --> 01:40:04,229
We brokered this deal but l
still think about the link..

1056
01:40:04,297 --> 01:40:09,291
..between Ravi Verma's death
and Goddess Kali's temple.

1057
01:40:09,802 --> 01:40:13,795
l'll tell you about it!

1058
01:40:15,908 --> 01:40:17,671
''You?
- Yes, Kabira!''

1059
01:40:18,177 --> 01:40:21,908
l'm the truth that the world refuses
to believe! That's me!

1060
01:40:22,315 --> 01:40:25,250
Think about it. A guy loves
a girl a lot and..

1061
01:40:25,752 --> 01:40:29,119
..goes against his religion and
traditions and marries her.

1062
01:40:29,322 --> 01:40:32,257
But the girl kills him just
two days into the marriage.

1063
01:40:32,759 --> 01:40:34,158
Only for money!

1064
01:40:34,327 --> 01:40:36,318
But look at nature's benevolence!

1065
01:40:36,662 --> 01:40:38,254
The lover has a rebirth!

1066
01:40:38,331 --> 01:40:40,265
''And in his youth, finds out that
the same girl is living..''

1067
01:40:40,767 --> 01:40:43,429
..comfortably as some princess!

1068
01:40:44,871 --> 01:40:47,271
The temple made by Ravi
Verma still exists.

1069
01:40:47,774 --> 01:40:50,971
The college funded by
Ravi Verma exists.

1070
01:40:52,044 --> 01:40:54,308
But where's the Verma family?!

1071
01:40:55,348 --> 01:40:58,044
Where are my mother and sister?!

1072
01:40:59,285 --> 01:41:02,311
Nobody knows anything! Nobody!

1073
01:41:03,222 --> 01:41:07,056
''What are you talking about?
- The truth, uncle Kabir!''

1074
01:41:08,161 --> 01:41:09,719
This miracle has happened to me.

1075
01:41:11,230 --> 01:41:12,788
This happened to me!

1076
01:41:13,132 --> 01:41:16,727
l'm not insane to talk this
way. This is the truth.

1077
01:41:17,236 --> 01:41:20,296
''So, you are that very
same Ravi Verma..''

1078
01:41:23,342 --> 01:41:27,301
Oh God! What kind of
a miracle is this?!

1079
01:41:28,648 --> 01:41:32,311
''
Monty, l believe you wholeheartedly..''

1080
01:41:32,819 --> 01:41:37,222
..even if nobody else does.

1081
01:41:40,092 --> 01:41:43,084
God knows where that lady must
have kept your mom and sister.

1082
01:41:47,066 --> 01:41:48,966
That's the reason l acted
as if l loved her.

1083
01:41:52,205 --> 01:41:53,536
l've even made her believe that..

1084
01:41:53,606 --> 01:41:55,972
..l'm her late husband Ravi Verma.

1085
01:41:56,943 --> 01:42:00,106
l told her that l don't
remember how l had died.

1086
01:42:01,113 --> 01:42:03,946
l did this to know about
my mom and sister.

1087
01:42:04,884 --> 01:42:09,617
And she told me that my mom and
sister are dead! A lie! A lie!

1088
01:42:10,623 --> 01:42:12,682
l have a feeling that
they both are alive.

1089
01:42:12,758 --> 01:42:15,090
l'm sure they are alive.

1090
01:42:15,895 --> 01:42:23,131
''Don't worry, God will certainly
take you to your mom and sister.''

1091
01:42:23,970 --> 01:42:28,634
You aren't alone.
We all will help you find them.

1092
01:42:29,575 --> 01:42:30,701
''
Let's go, Tina.''

1093
01:42:33,913 --> 01:42:36,746
''l'm sorry, Monty,
l misunderstood you.''

1094
01:42:37,216 --> 01:42:38,274
''
lts okay, Tina.''

1095
01:42:57,169 --> 01:43:03,733
Ravi Verma would be the only
name left after Shantaprasad.

1096
01:43:05,344 --> 01:43:07,403
He'll repay what the
Verma family owes.

1097
01:43:09,081 --> 01:43:11,811
He'll make them respectable
once again.

1098
01:43:35,007 --> 01:43:37,202
''
Brother, you broke the guitar again?''

1099
01:43:37,443 --> 01:43:39,843
You haven't learnt guitar
even though you're..

1100
01:43:40,112 --> 01:43:42,103
..the elder brother
of a guitar champion!

1101
01:43:42,949 --> 01:43:48,114
''Sister, your brother always
does what he intends to do.''

1102
01:43:49,121 --> 01:43:56,027
Forget it! You'll have to have
a rebirth to learn guitar! - You!

1103
01:44:23,155 --> 01:44:26,090
Kabira is at your behest
and requests..

1104
01:44:27,093 --> 01:44:31,029
''..you oh God, unite the one's
who have parted ways.''

1105
01:44:32,631 --> 01:44:36,192
''
Unite them, oh God.''

1106
01:44:51,217 --> 01:44:54,448
''Martha. - Martha's not come
today, sir. l'm her replacement.''

1107
01:44:54,787 --> 01:44:56,311
Get me a glass of water.

1108
01:45:03,062 --> 01:45:04,120
''
Tea is ready, sir.''

1109
01:45:04,296 --> 01:45:06,093
Just get me ajug of water!

1110
01:45:06,932 --> 01:45:09,799
''Sir, one should not drink
alcohol in the morning..''

1111
01:45:09,869 --> 01:45:11,427
Shut up and get me water..

1112
01:45:12,071 --> 01:45:15,234
Elders say alcohol ruins families.

1113
01:45:25,751 --> 01:45:27,742
What's your name?
- Laxmi.

1114
01:45:28,320 --> 01:45:33,485
Martha stays near my place.
l came here as she wasn't well.

1115
01:45:33,826 --> 01:45:38,126
''
Laxmi? No, your name can't be Laxmi.''

1116
01:45:38,197 --> 01:45:42,224
You aren't Laxmi.
- l'm Laxmi. - You can't be Laxmi!

1117
01:45:42,301 --> 01:45:43,768
You're Jyoyti! Jyoti!

1118
01:45:45,304 --> 01:45:49,035
My name is Laxmi not Jyoti!
l'm Laxmi!

1119
01:45:49,108 --> 01:45:52,305
You're lying! You're Jyoti!
- No!

1120
01:45:53,846 --> 01:45:55,837
''Please don't address me
that way, sir.''

1121
01:45:55,915 --> 01:45:57,780
Then why don't you tell
me that you are..

1122
01:45:57,850 --> 01:45:58,908
..Shantaprasad Verma's daughter!

1123
01:45:58,984 --> 01:46:01,851
Shantaprasad's dead! So
is the Verma family!

1124
01:46:02,421 --> 01:46:04,048
l'm not related to them.

1125
01:46:05,458 --> 01:46:12,261
l'm poor and l work
to support my kids.

1126
01:46:13,332 --> 01:46:15,300
How are you even related to me?!

1127
01:46:16,368 --> 01:46:21,863
Don't hurt me by thinking that
l'm a part of the Verma family.

1128
01:46:23,008 --> 01:46:24,066
Pinky..

1129
01:46:30,049 --> 01:46:32,142
''Pinky?
- Yes, Pinky.''

1130
01:46:34,220 --> 01:46:36,950
''You didn't, but l recognised
you, my sister.''

1131
01:46:37,022 --> 01:46:39,513
Sister? You called me sister?

1132
01:46:39,892 --> 01:46:43,885
''Yes, Pinky. You're Ravi
Verma's sister, isn't it?''

1133
01:46:44,330 --> 01:46:47,163
He used to call you Pinky lovingly.
- Ravi Verma?

1134
01:46:48,167 --> 01:46:50,533
How do you know him?
- Because l am..

1135
01:46:52,171 --> 01:46:53,832
''
l mean, l'm Ravi Verma's friend.''

1136
01:46:54,907 --> 01:46:58,399
''No, l mean, my father used to be
a friend of his at Cape Town.''

1137
01:46:59,178 --> 01:47:01,908
Cape Town? Brother used
to go there frequently.

1138
01:47:02,181 --> 01:47:04,342
l have your family photograph
in my house.

1139
01:47:05,484 --> 01:47:07,145
Father told me to enquire
about the Verma family..

1140
01:47:07,219 --> 01:47:09,551
..whenever l visit Cape Town.

1141
01:47:10,723 --> 01:47:13,521
''He too tried his best to search
you all, but couldn't succeed.''

1142
01:47:14,493 --> 01:47:16,222
''
We don't exist now, sir.''

1143
01:47:17,496 --> 01:47:21,227
We faced a lot of hardships
after brother's death.

1144
01:47:22,234 --> 01:47:25,567
We are two dead bodies.
Me and my mother.

1145
01:47:26,672 --> 01:47:28,299
Mom? Where's she? How's she?

1146
01:47:28,574 --> 01:47:30,303
''Please, take me to her.
l want to meet her now!''

1147
01:47:30,509 --> 01:47:37,415
''lt's no use, sir.
She's in a sorry state.''

1148
01:47:38,717 --> 01:47:44,417
Brother died years ago but she
still can't hear or talk to anyone.

1149
01:47:47,860 --> 01:47:49,225
''
'Hey, return my pencil to me!'''

1150
01:47:49,862 --> 01:47:51,921
'l didn't take your pencil!'
- 'Don't lie!'

1151
01:47:52,131 --> 01:47:53,257
'You took my new pencil!'

1152
01:47:54,300 --> 01:47:57,064
''Granny, Raju isn't returning
my pencil to me!''

1153
01:47:58,137 --> 01:48:00,537
Don't tell her she
can't hear or talk.

1154
01:48:10,416 --> 01:48:14,216
She keeps gazing at brother's
photograph everyday.

1155
01:48:14,887 --> 01:48:16,878
She never sleeps.

1156

''
You've come, son..''

Yes.

1159
01:49:15,614 --> 01:49:19,243
''You must be very tired,
isn't it dear?''

1160
01:49:20,986 --> 01:49:23,284
''
Pinky, look. Ravi's come!''

1161

l knew you would be late
but you would surely come.

1162
01:49:37,102 --> 01:49:40,629
Tell me. Why don't you talk?

1163

''
You're my Ravi, isn't it?''

''
Yes. Yes, you're my Ravi.''

1165
01:49:56,655 --> 01:49:58,316
My dear son!

1166
01:49:59,158 --> 01:50:03,822
''Mother, have a seat.
He's not your Ravi.''

1167
01:50:03,896 --> 01:50:07,593
''No..
- Mom, you aren't feeling well. Come.''

1168
01:50:07,666 --> 01:50:09,657
No! He's my son Ravi!

1169
01:50:09,735 --> 01:50:11,669
He's my son Ravi!

1170
01:50:12,171 --> 01:50:16,073
God can deceive everybody
but not a mother.

1171
01:50:16,141 --> 01:50:19,736
''He's my son. - He's not your son,
mom. He's someone else!''

1172
01:50:19,812 --> 01:50:22,007
No.. he's my son Ravi.

1173
01:50:22,081 --> 01:50:28,020
Please leave her alone. - But..
- l told you all to let her be.

1174

Mother!

01:50:40,032 --> 01:50:41,659
''Mom..

''
Nobody recognised me, but you did.''

1178
01:50:51,877 --> 01:50:55,938
My son recognised me!

1179
01:50:58,050 --> 01:50:59,745
He recognised his mother!

1180
01:51:00,753 --> 01:51:05,019
''Mom, you'll have to
listen to me now..''

1181

''Great. Oh God, you hurt
and you heal too.''

''
Dear, he's your brother Ravi.''

1190
01:52:13,826 --> 01:52:15,794
A miracle of God.

01:52:16,862 --> 01:52:24,792
''Monty, you carry out your work.
l'll look after them.''

1192
01:52:30,342 --> 01:52:34,073

01:52:37,416 --> 01:52:40,715
..he will pay me 5 lakhs
every month.

1195
01:52:41,920 --> 01:52:45,515
Only you knew about
the property papers.

1196
01:52:46,892 --> 01:52:50,851
Mother wasn't well and l had
to send her to lndia too..

1197
01:52:52,431 --> 01:52:54,899
Therefore l accepted
Sir Juda's offer.

1198
01:52:58,837 --> 01:53:03,433
People even passed comments
that l am Sir Juda's keep.

1199
01:53:04,910 --> 01:53:09,745
But l tolerated everything for
mother and Jyoti's sake.

1200
01:53:14,720 --> 01:53:19,885
''Kamini, you've sacrificed
a lot for my family,''

1201
01:53:22,461 --> 01:53:24,793
''And now, Sir Juda will
have to pay for it.''

1202
01:53:26,732 --> 01:53:29,633
''Come, l'll tell you where
the property papers are.''

1203
01:53:31,737 --> 01:53:33,967
''But Monty, there's a wall here!
- Just come with me.''

1204
01:53:36,742 --> 01:53:37,936
Oh my God!

1205
01:53:56,261 --> 01:53:57,421
Here are the property papers.

1206
01:53:58,030 --> 01:54:01,898
File them in court on my behalf.

1207
01:54:02,000 --> 01:54:03,991
Court?!
- Why?!

1208
01:54:04,736 --> 01:54:06,829
''l want to fulfill my mother's
dream, Kamini.''

1209
01:54:06,939 --> 01:54:09,999
Sir Juda's a dangerous man.
He can do anything!

1210
01:54:10,075 --> 01:54:13,374
''He can't. Tell me, are
you with me on this?''

1211
01:54:14,279 --> 01:54:17,271
Yes. l love you.

1212
01:54:20,052 --> 01:54:23,021
''l love you too, Kamini.
l love you too.''

1213
01:54:25,991 --> 01:54:27,720
What nonsense are you talking
about?! Rebirths!

1214
01:54:28,060 --> 01:54:29,118
''
lt's true, sir.''

1215
01:54:29,795 --> 01:54:33,253
l've seen him taking out the
property papers from the safe.

1216
01:54:33,332 --> 01:54:36,130
She's about to file a
court case against you.

1217
01:54:42,808 --> 01:54:45,470
Sir Juda says you should keep a
close eye on Kamini from now on.

1218
01:54:45,744 --> 01:54:46,802
Okay.

1219
01:54:46,878 --> 01:54:49,472
''lf what you say turns out to
be true, you'll be rich soon.''

1220
01:54:50,349 --> 01:54:51,976
''
Thank you, Sir Juda.''

1221
01:55:03,929 --> 01:55:04,987
''
You're right, Sir Juda.''

1222
01:55:05,497 --> 01:55:08,057
Kamini has revolted against
us on Monty's insistence.

1223
01:55:08,767 --> 01:55:11,167
''lf Monty dies, so will
Kamini's resilience.''

1224
01:55:20,045 --> 01:55:22,912
''May l come in, Princess?
- Yes, Tina.''

1225
01:55:24,783 --> 01:55:27,946
''l want to talk to you about
something, Princess. - Yes.''

1226
01:55:29,521 --> 01:55:31,182
Monty has told me everything.

1227
01:55:32,524 --> 01:55:36,187
lt seems he's made just for you.

1228
01:55:38,630 --> 01:55:42,293
l cannot interfere with a person
who's just come back..

1229
01:55:42,534 --> 01:55:45,970
..from the brink of death.

1230
01:55:48,540 --> 01:55:52,533
l won't mind it if you marry Monty.

1231
01:55:53,812 --> 01:55:59,717
''Tina, you've relieved
me from my troubles!''

1232
01:56:00,552 --> 01:56:03,646
l'll never forget this act of yours.

1233
01:56:09,094 --> 01:56:11,688
''Tina - Now you don't have a reason
not to marry, right?''

1234
01:56:14,733 --> 01:56:15,791
No.

1235
01:56:16,535 --> 01:56:19,595
lt's Ravi's death anniversary
in three days.

1236
01:56:20,806 --> 01:56:22,273
We will get married after that.

1237

his death anniversary!

1239
01:56:25,877 --> 01:56:28,607
''Kamini, we will get married
that very day.''

1240

l'll tell them how true love comes
to life even after death!

1244
01:56:54,673 --> 01:56:56,072
According to Sir Juda's plan..

1245
01:56:56,141 --> 01:56:58,735
..we will give you a
guitar after an hour.

1246
01:56:59,144 --> 01:57:01,135
You have to replace it
with Monty's guitar.

1247
01:57:02,147 --> 01:57:04,138
''l'll do it, but what
would that achieve?''

1248
01:57:07,285 --> 01:57:10,083
''Sir Juda says, upon touching
the strings of that guitar..''

1249
01:57:10,155 --> 01:57:12,146
..Monty will return to his world.

1250

''
So please welcome, Princess Kamini!''
