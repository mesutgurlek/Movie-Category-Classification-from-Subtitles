1
00:02:33,235 --> 00:02:35,696
What is in the power nowadays
in your Malinovka?

2
00:02:35,778 --> 00:02:41,242
- Nobody. Nobody, believes me
- How can it be?

3
00:02:41,488 --> 00:02:43,198
And what is this?

4
00:02:43,282 --> 00:02:46,368
Nobody, except grandpa Nitchepore.
I told him so.

5
00:02:46,450 --> 00:02:47,117
And he?

6
00:02:47,199 --> 00:02:52,705
And he told me to convey greetings
from valorous Red Cavalry to grandpa Nitchepore

7
00:02:52,952 --> 00:02:55,329
And all other inhabitants. From Kotovsky.

8
00:02:55,412 --> 00:02:58,206
- From cavalry?
- Red Cavalry?

9
00:02:59,706 --> 00:03:01,750
Why are you screaming?

10
00:03:01,831 --> 00:03:03,916
Maybe they'll call in on the way?

11
00:03:03,999 --> 00:03:05,917
- But you don't call.
- No, of course.

12
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:08,794
- And you don't call.
- Yes, sure.

13
00:03:14,920 --> 00:03:17,131
What else?

14
00:03:17,213 --> 00:03:21,885
- A, I remember. Hello, Irene.
- There you are.

15
00:03:22,507 --> 00:03:25,677
Hello, Andrew.
I thought that you've forgotten.

16
00:03:25,759 --> 00:03:29,471
How you could think so, Irene.

17
00:03:29,552 --> 00:03:32,013
- Ups, your boss.
- Baliasniy.

18
00:03:32,095 --> 00:03:34,848
Pr-r guys. Stop.
Come to stand still all of you.

19
00:03:38,848 --> 00:03:40,224
I called in to you on my way.

20
00:03:40,307 --> 00:03:44,353
I live on such place, everyone who
passes through certainly calls in to me.

21
00:03:44,434 --> 00:03:46,978
This happens quite often,
and with everyone.

22
00:03:48,436 --> 00:03:51,022
Stamp a seal for my well being

23
00:03:51,103 --> 00:03:54,023
on this ticket,
that I handed in allotment.

24
00:03:54,522 --> 00:03:56,566
- Handed in?
- Handed in.

25
00:03:56,814 --> 00:04:00,943
And not in 5 pounds like others.
But in 100 pods and all power to the Soviet.

26
00:04:01,025 --> 00:04:03,152
Please stamp a seal.

27
00:04:03,901 --> 00:04:07,488
And where've you been today's
morning, my dear?

28
00:04:07,569 --> 00:04:12,532
- I've been to the farriery.
- Someone told me that you've been to the monastery.

29
00:04:12,614 --> 00:04:15,492
- Who told you that lie?
- A magpie brought that news.

30
00:04:15,573 --> 00:04:19,160
- She told you lies.
- Magpie isn't a dog. She never lies.

31
00:04:21,409 --> 00:04:27,332
I'll tell you in secret, there is a rumor,
that the regime will change soon.

32
00:04:28,496 --> 00:04:32,833
- Stamp a seal.
- Don't make haste.

33
00:04:38,042 --> 00:04:41,629
- You think that it will change?
- There's a rumor.

34
00:04:48,046 --> 00:04:52,509
Well, let's go. Go, go.

35
00:04:57,842 --> 00:05:00,512
I'm sick of sheep farming here,
at Poyasniy farm.

36
00:05:02,636 --> 00:05:10,185
You know, Irene, if Red Cavalry
will call in on the way I'll join them.

37
00:05:11,848 --> 00:05:15,018
- To fight.
- Right. And I'm going with you.

38
00:05:15,100 --> 00:05:17,352
- You can't, you'll be killed.
- And you?

39
00:05:17,434 --> 00:05:20,646
I'm not that kind of person.

40
00:06:12,710 --> 00:06:16,589
- Is you mother at home?
- No. Kiss. Mother.

41
00:06:16,670 --> 00:06:18,171
Well, I'm fleeing.

42
00:06:21,255 --> 00:06:23,674
What are you daubing these trees for?

43
00:06:23,756 --> 00:06:26,509
- Who is here else?
- No one, I'm alone.

44
00:06:26,591 --> 00:06:30,636
- Something loomed to me...
- Andrew came to grandpa Nitchepore.

45
00:06:30,718 --> 00:06:34,888
- Then, she'd been kissing with Nitchepore?
- Ups mother, noticed.

46
00:06:36,387 --> 00:06:38,723
I've noticed that from Christmas.

47
00:06:40,389 --> 00:06:42,725
- Fell in love?
- Yes.

48
00:06:42,807 --> 00:06:45,184
- And he?
- Yes.

49
00:06:45,224 --> 00:06:48,978
What should we do with you?
Marry you off?

50
00:06:50,560 --> 00:06:52,395
Oh, mommy!

51
00:06:53,312 --> 00:06:56,732
Mother, isn't it frightful to get married?

52
00:06:56,771 --> 00:07:00,901
To get married? No.
To merry is more frightful.

53
00:07:00,982 --> 00:07:05,153
A damned wretch like you can come across
a boy, and he'll be plagued with her.

54
00:07:05,400 --> 00:07:08,904
- Oh, mommy
- I was justjoking.

55
00:07:10,028 --> 00:07:16,659
My dear daughter.You grew up like an orphan,
and now you're like a cherry in spring.

56
00:07:18,031 --> 00:07:20,658
You're like your father.

57
00:07:21,449 --> 00:07:24,785
No mother
You're very beautiful.

58
00:07:24,826 --> 00:07:26,578
Oh, daughter.

59
00:07:29,745 --> 00:07:33,081
- May I go and gladden Andrew?
- Yes.

60
00:07:52,088 --> 00:07:55,175
Nitchepore. Nitchepore.

61
00:07:57,216 --> 00:07:59,801
Nitchepore. Nitchepore.

62
00:07:59,883 --> 00:08:04,888
What? Why is my Gapusia running?

63
00:08:05,427 --> 00:08:11,517
Nitchepore. Are you here, sweet?
Let's go quickly to Trindichiha.

64
00:08:11,597 --> 00:08:14,266
To Trindichiha, who angrily
can do heaven knows what.

65
00:08:14,348 --> 00:08:16,391
Therefore, When Trindichiha,
is angry! Oh!

66
00:08:16,432 --> 00:08:19,936
What if someone will hitch her,
then she'll do a queer thing.

67
00:08:19,975 --> 00:08:23,938
That everything will go wrong.
And if she is angry...

68
00:08:23,977 --> 00:08:25,729
Don't make haste.

69
00:08:26,312 --> 00:08:32,443
I'm asking for 35 years, Gapusia, don't has
ten, because we're not sure. Understand?

70
00:08:32,564 --> 00:08:34,733
What has happened?

71
00:08:35,566 --> 00:08:38,402
Here, as always
I can't put in a word.

72
00:08:38,442 --> 00:08:41,654
And I keep silent.
Because I'm not a wife, I'm an angel.

73
00:08:41,735 --> 00:08:44,238
And if you're an angel,
why do you live among people?

74
00:08:44,320 --> 00:08:49,242
Where's the power? Grannies, follow
me! Follow me! Grannies!

75
00:08:49,322 --> 00:08:52,617
Come here! Where the power?

76
00:08:52,865 --> 00:08:56,202
- Stop women.
- Here is the power. Yes?

77
00:08:56,284 --> 00:08:59,371
We've put you over us,
for the order could be established.

78
00:08:59,452 --> 00:09:01,204
And I'm mocked!

79
00:09:01,286 --> 00:09:03,705
- We'll investigate now.
- There's nothing to investigate.

80
00:09:03,787 --> 00:09:08,792
Oh, Komariha! I gave her sweet
milk, and what did she return me?

81
00:09:08,832 --> 00:09:09,541
Sour. Yes?

82
00:09:09,623 --> 00:09:11,208
Shame on you!

83
00:09:11,290 --> 00:09:14,502
You don't think that I'm weak,
I can hit!

84
00:09:14,750 --> 00:09:16,210
And I can too.

85
00:09:17,043 --> 00:09:22,340
Quiet! Quiet!
We'll investigate.

86
00:09:23,630 --> 00:09:27,926
Not sour. We tasted it. Here is she,
she and she. The milk is sweet.

87
00:09:28,006 --> 00:09:29,550
- Sour.
- Sweet.

88
00:09:29,632 --> 00:09:32,009
- Sour.
- Sweet. - Sour.

89
00:09:32,551 --> 00:09:35,303
I can't come over. How can't you come over?

90
00:09:37,970 --> 00:09:41,306
You have to protect me.
I'm a woman nevertheless.

91
00:09:42,221 --> 00:09:43,347
I can't come over.

92
00:09:46,140 --> 00:09:47,766
- Hungry.
- It's better now, grannies.

93
00:09:48,391 --> 00:09:51,227
Here what I'll tell you,
I've been to the town.

94
00:09:51,392 --> 00:09:53,477
People say that Red Cavalry is just
about to capture "Prikup".

95
00:09:53,518 --> 00:09:54,144
Really?

96
00:09:54,394 --> 00:09:56,521
It seems that the war
will be finished soon.

97
00:09:56,645 --> 00:10:02,025
Oh, grannies,
husbands will come back home.

98
00:10:02,106 --> 00:10:06,402
Trindichiha, neighbor.
Or we're not tell-tales with you?

99
00:10:06,983 --> 00:10:10,153
To one a husband will come
back.To another will not.

100
00:10:11,152 --> 00:10:13,404
15 years ago she lost her husband.

101
00:10:13,485 --> 00:10:15,696
Pan Chechil stole him to the Siberia.

102
00:10:24,740 --> 00:10:37,253
Aches, aches, aches my head.

103
00:10:37,329 --> 00:10:52,887
Without reason.

104
00:10:52,962 --> 00:11:06,350
The road is tenantless.

105
00:11:06,426 --> 00:11:10,180
And with no one to stroll with.

106
00:11:55,907 --> 00:11:59,911
Why are you driving your women
totears, Sofia Mihailovna?

107
00:12:00,910 --> 00:12:05,122
Oh, your women's tears
If I'll shed a tear.

108
00:12:05,203 --> 00:12:06,829
Don't hurry up.

109
00:12:09,038 --> 00:12:11,832
Oh, troubles with chickens.
If you'll not look after - they'll die.

110
00:12:11,915 --> 00:12:15,460
Women's tears are like water
The are fading along the way.

111
00:12:21,794 --> 00:12:24,880
Like on the river, on the brook,
I kiss the one I don't know who.

112
00:13:51,710 --> 00:13:54,796
Greg, why am I in such sympathize with you?

113
00:14:30,102 --> 00:14:32,313
The regime changes again?

114
00:14:32,978 --> 00:14:36,773
- Hello, compatriot.
- Hurrah.

115
00:14:40,565 --> 00:14:43,526
Hurrah.

116
00:14:43,983 --> 00:14:48,321
Grannies, look it's Gridko.

117
00:14:52,404 --> 00:14:54,323
Just look how he dressed up.

118
00:14:54,405 --> 00:14:56,240
Hey, did you become Petlura?

119
00:14:56,281 --> 00:15:01,161
I'm Petlura in my self.
Don't play jokes here.

120
00:15:01,533 --> 00:15:05,245
I have a whole cavalry here
in the monastery.

121
00:15:07,536 --> 00:15:09,747
Just imagine Gridko.

122
00:15:09,828 --> 00:15:14,916
Gridko was but then disappeared. Where
is my first aide-de-camp? Papandopala.

123
00:15:14,955 --> 00:15:16,874
I'm here Greg.

124
00:15:16,956 --> 00:15:17,874
- Appeal to me.
- Please.

125
00:15:17,915 --> 00:15:21,210
- Pan ataman Grecian Tavricheskiy.
- Stand at ease!

126
00:15:21,250 --> 00:15:22,460
- Did you hear?
- Tell me, grandpa Nitchepore.

127
00:15:22,542 --> 00:15:25,170
I wanted to ask you,
Pan ataman Gridko.

128
00:15:25,210 --> 00:15:26,920
- Papandopala.
- What, Greg?

129
00:15:27,337 --> 00:15:29,422
Appeal to me one more time,
they must get used to this.

130
00:15:29,503 --> 00:15:30,504
Please.

131
00:15:30,588 --> 00:15:32,715
Pan ataman Grecian.

132
00:15:32,922 --> 00:15:34,466
- Don't put him out.
- Quiet.

133
00:15:34,548 --> 00:15:37,968
They put you out, Greg, here and there
are gesticulationamong the public.

134
00:15:38,300 --> 00:15:41,470
- Let's disperse beautifully.
- Say.

135
00:15:42,301 --> 00:15:46,430
I want to ask you,
Pan ataman Grecian.

136
00:15:46,511 --> 00:15:49,389
- Vricheskiy.
- Shut up.

137
00:15:49,638 --> 00:15:54,809
Aha, Vricheskiy. Do you have as they
say any schedule?

138
00:15:57,934 --> 00:16:01,896
Sure, we can't do anything without a schedule.
Do you think that I'm a gangster from a big road?

139
00:16:01,977 --> 00:16:03,896
I'm an ataman with
firm ideological principles.

140
00:16:03,978 --> 00:16:08,316
- And all my boys like one.
- Fight for the freedom of the personality.

141
00:16:08,396 --> 00:16:10,315
Then, they will rob.

142
00:16:12,523 --> 00:16:16,694
I've been to Tavria, Moldavia,
I've seen many things and places.

143
00:16:16,901 --> 00:16:21,405
And decided to establish in your
volost independent power.

144
00:16:21,444 --> 00:16:23,655
Why am I in such sympathize with you?

145
00:16:24,779 --> 00:16:26,948
Maybe you stand up
for the soviet power?

146
00:16:27,030 --> 00:16:30,158
Then we'll do it in 2 weeks,
we can even faster.

147
00:16:30,240 --> 00:16:32,325
At once if you like in 45 minutes.

148
00:16:37,159 --> 00:16:38,410
Don't hurry up.

149
00:17:04,630 --> 00:17:09,593
On the sea sand
I met Marusia.

150
00:17:09,675 --> 00:17:24,314
In pink stockings, waist in the corset.
In pink Stockings. Waist in the corset.

151
00:17:27,474 --> 00:17:30,727
Irene, I'll make you ataman's woman
I'll sew expensive smart dresses for you.

152
00:17:30,809 --> 00:17:32,060
- I'll take you.
- Where?

153
00:17:32,101 --> 00:17:35,521
Into my band. In the cavalry. I'll give you a sabre.
I'll give you a horse. Let's go to the shed.

154
00:17:39,396 --> 00:17:44,150
What if a patrol.
It rides out a storm.

155
00:17:44,232 --> 00:17:49,112
Goodbye, Pava.
I'll come back soon.

156
00:17:51,819 --> 00:17:58,742
Goodbye, Pava.
I'll come back soon.

157
00:17:59,780 --> 00:18:02,283
Don't get into this. Don't get
into this. I don't wish that.

158
00:18:02,365 --> 00:18:04,951
Leave her alone. Do you think
that if you wear a sabre,

159
00:18:05,032 --> 00:18:07,451
Then you can get
any girl?

160
00:18:07,534 --> 00:18:09,870
If you want, I'll celebrate
a wedding tomorrow.

161
00:18:10,535 --> 00:18:12,537
Again wedding.

162
00:18:13,579 --> 00:18:17,958
Where are you Marusia
with whom are you walking?

163
00:18:17,997 --> 00:18:23,085
You kiss the other, and bite me.

164
00:18:25,625 --> 00:18:32,841
You kiss the other and bite me.

165
00:18:34,546 --> 00:18:36,423
Don't turn over, Sofia Mihailovna.

166
00:18:36,589 --> 00:18:39,091
God knows, I didn't want
to offend my people.

167
00:18:39,174 --> 00:18:41,676
And if I'll have a chance
I'll burn Malinovka to decay.

168
00:18:44,843 --> 00:18:46,386
I won't leave.

169
00:18:48,720 --> 00:18:49,804
Catch her.

170
00:18:50,761 --> 00:18:53,181
Sofia Mihailovna, where are you going?

171
00:18:56,848 --> 00:18:58,224
Catch her.

172
00:18:58,265 --> 00:19:04,188
No, I'm contused. Greg,
you know my nervous system.

173
00:20:35,976 --> 00:20:41,774
Don't take umbrage, boy, but in the
presence of people don't call on me.

174
00:20:42,562 --> 00:20:46,858
You,f ailing, are gone with the wind,
and they will demand from me.

175
00:20:46,940 --> 00:20:49,734
- Never mind, Chechil will arrive,
everything will get better.
- Chechil?

176
00:20:49,816 --> 00:20:54,070
If I knew how he looks like this
Chechil, black or white.

177
00:20:54,151 --> 00:20:56,112
Black, white.

178
00:21:07,616 --> 00:21:09,034
Boys are not satisfied with me.

179
00:21:09,325 --> 00:21:12,203
They say, what is an ataman
without gold reserves.

180
00:21:13,827 --> 00:21:16,746
Father. Pennies.

181
00:21:20,414 --> 00:21:24,418
We are good at taking pennies.

182
00:21:29,418 --> 00:21:32,963
Look boy. Look.

183
00:21:34,503 --> 00:21:38,590
Chechil will have a document.
In the home-rolled cigarette.

184
00:21:38,713 --> 00:21:43,218
Commander, when he was running,
he threw it into the bush.

185
00:21:43,424 --> 00:21:46,510
- And this what he had with him.
- English?

186
00:21:48,175 --> 00:21:48,509
Yours?

187
00:21:51,844 --> 00:21:56,849
Who is he? Where?
For what? As you were.

188
00:22:00,889 --> 00:22:01,890
Are you interested?

189
00:22:09,394 --> 00:22:10,395
Get up!

190
00:22:19,982 --> 00:22:21,734
I didn't expect.

191
00:22:22,442 --> 00:22:24,402
With you father, Pan Chechil

192
00:22:24,484 --> 00:22:28,238
We are old friends,
but i didn't make friends with you.

193
00:22:29,737 --> 00:22:32,406
We travel more to Capitals,
and abroad.

194
00:22:32,779 --> 00:22:34,239
Well, glad to meet you.

195
00:22:34,363 --> 00:22:37,575
Commander of a special horse
troop Nazar Duma.

196
00:22:37,656 --> 00:22:40,576
I ask again, who are you?
Where? For what?

197
00:22:44,285 --> 00:22:45,286
To the headquarters.

198
00:22:51,913 --> 00:22:57,919
- Well done, boys. Well done.
- Well done.

199
00:23:35,391 --> 00:23:37,769
- Boys, did you give sea-roaches?
- Yes.

200
00:23:54,649 --> 00:23:57,611
And maybe you're Kotovskiy in person?

201
00:23:59,444 --> 00:24:00,904
No, it's Basil.

202
00:24:01,111 --> 00:24:03,864
And this is Peter - bessarabian,
your commander assistant.

203
00:24:05,905 --> 00:24:07,281
From where? Why? For what?

204
00:24:08,198 --> 00:24:10,116
I'm from Malinovka. There...

205
00:24:11,908 --> 00:24:12,909
What?

206
00:24:15,534 --> 00:24:18,454
Break up. Break up.
What didn't you see here?

207
00:24:18,535 --> 00:24:20,496
Simple man,
only with a scythe.

208
00:24:21,371 --> 00:24:22,622
Maybe, she is hungry?

209
00:24:23,663 --> 00:24:28,042
Madam, take this sea-roach,
it's salty. Don't hesitate.

210
00:24:28,248 --> 00:24:33,253
Nibble it, nibble. If the major here
if we talk about calming.

211
00:24:34,168 --> 00:24:35,378
What is it in our Malinovka?

212
00:24:35,460 --> 00:24:39,047
Grecian with his band.
fell on me, and said : I'll marry you.

213
00:24:39,212 --> 00:24:41,297
The wedding is tomorrow.

214
00:24:43,464 --> 00:24:49,011
Madam, I beg you,
please stop this right now.

215
00:24:51,592 --> 00:24:53,719
Basil, sea-roach.

216
00:24:53,843 --> 00:24:57,263
Madam, nibble it, nibble.

217
00:24:57,387 --> 00:25:00,264
- Then, he's going to marry.
- And you?

218
00:25:01,097 --> 00:25:02,640
- And I say : "no"
- And he?

219
00:25:02,722 --> 00:25:04,432
- And wanted to kiss me.
- And you?

220
00:25:04,515 --> 00:25:06,558
And I ran away, and his
aide-de-camp ran after me.

221
00:25:06,641 --> 00:25:09,268
And I fetched a blow with rakes
along his back, bang, in half.

222
00:25:09,350 --> 00:25:11,686
- His back in half?
- No, rakes.

223
00:25:15,520 --> 00:25:17,939
How I like such clever
and conscious madams.

224
00:25:20,939 --> 00:25:25,110
- Now you'll stay with us?
- No. I have mother and Andrew at home.

225
00:25:25,191 --> 00:25:29,404
- Andrew? Who is Andrew?
- He's my fiance.

226
00:25:32,278 --> 00:25:34,697
Commander,
girls from Malinovka.

227
00:25:34,778 --> 00:25:39,783
I've heard everything. But nobody
must know that you've been to us.

228
00:25:39,823 --> 00:25:42,200
- And mother?
- Your mother especially.

229
00:25:42,282 --> 00:25:43,825
And Andrew?

230
00:25:43,908 --> 00:25:47,537
Do you want to marry Andrew?
Then don't tell him anything.

231
00:25:49,160 --> 00:25:50,537
Andrew.

232
00:25:50,619 --> 00:26:00,421
Oh, wind my wind,
tell where are you going.

233
00:26:01,416 --> 00:26:09,465
Where are you rushing off?.

234
00:26:10,128 --> 00:26:18,428
Tell me, the wind,
my friend with the wings.

235
00:26:18,507 --> 00:26:26,765
Don't you want to help a boy?

236
00:26:26,844 --> 00:26:36,520
Fly my wind, fly my wind.

237
00:26:36,599 --> 00:26:45,566
Fly faster, fly without idleness.

238
00:26:45,644 --> 00:26:57,031
And find a sweetheart,
wherever you want.

239
00:26:57,107 --> 00:27:07,868
Bow from the waist.

240
00:27:09,822 --> 00:27:11,532
Without complains.

241
00:27:11,906 --> 00:27:17,036
You'd better carry off Balasniy's
horse and gallop to the "Camels".

242
00:27:17,117 --> 00:27:21,872
Irene ran away right there.
And while Grecian isn't there...

243
00:27:22,369 --> 00:27:23,495
I'll...

244
00:27:26,246 --> 00:27:28,540
Well, well without foolishness.

245
00:27:29,289 --> 00:27:32,500
And remember, if you'll meet
anywhere one of us, don't recognize.

246
00:27:32,624 --> 00:27:35,460
And don't tell anything,
anybody about your aims.

247
00:27:35,958 --> 00:27:38,502
And don't be afraid of Grecian.
He's already gone from Malinovka.

248
00:27:38,585 --> 00:27:41,254
- He galloped to the monastery.
- I'm not afraid.- Well, brave one

249
00:27:42,337 --> 00:27:46,174
I exorcised you. And
you're chilled and must be hungry.

250
00:27:46,255 --> 00:27:48,925
Well boys,
feed and warm this girl.

251
00:27:48,964 --> 00:27:50,049
Very good.

252
00:27:52,007 --> 00:27:53,133
Lets go.

253
00:28:05,680 --> 00:28:08,141
- What's your name?
- Irene.

254
00:28:09,891 --> 00:28:11,851
You're pretty Irene.

255
00:28:16,602 --> 00:28:21,190
Other rich girls have
houses that are full trunks.

256
00:28:21,270 --> 00:28:25,566
They have poplins, they have sateen
But they have nothing inside themselves.

257
00:28:25,648 --> 00:28:30,069
I like a girl
without poplins and sateen.

258
00:28:30,108 --> 00:28:34,446
Just like Irene
We'll take her with us on our campaign.

259
00:28:34,527 --> 00:28:39,073
I wish I could go with you,
But I have to get back home.

260
00:28:39,112 --> 00:28:45,410
Come back to us soon.
The whole village will meet you.

261
00:28:45,490 --> 00:28:54,999
Nightingale fell into silence,
Relatives are waiting for their sons.

262
00:29:06,708 --> 00:29:14,967
I'll walk out to the field, and finish my singing
I'll tell about my love in it.

263
00:29:15,045 --> 00:29:19,299
We'll find our happiness.
And will enter the future with it.

264
00:29:19,339 --> 00:29:29,057
There's no other life more beautiful than
ours. We'll go through joy and grief.

265
00:29:30,386 --> 00:29:32,888
The team heads on to the Perekop
according their route.

266
00:29:33,178 --> 00:29:34,513
And we're heading on to Malinovka.

267
00:29:34,595 --> 00:29:39,225
Our aim is to scout and
at 12 o'clock p.m. join the team.

268
00:29:39,515 --> 00:29:41,934
- You'll direct the team, Peter.
- And you, Nazar Vasiljevich?

269
00:29:42,307 --> 00:29:47,938
I? And I straight on. Grecian
is waiting for the staff-captain Chechil.

270
00:29:48,269 --> 00:29:49,937
- Clear?
- Clear.

271
00:29:50,019 --> 00:29:52,105
Well.

272
00:29:53,020 --> 00:29:56,858
You'll direct the team through the forest.
You'll come out there, by the river.

273
00:29:57,189 --> 00:29:59,733
And then along the bank
right to Malinovka.

274
00:29:59,858 --> 00:30:00,817
I see.

275
00:30:04,734 --> 00:30:05,944
Malinovka.

276
00:30:13,238 --> 00:30:15,532
Why are you sad, Nazar Vasiljevich?

277
00:30:16,614 --> 00:30:23,788
These are my native lands, Peter.
I recall my house, wife, daughter.

278
00:30:24,910 --> 00:30:28,247
You didn't tell us about them.
Where are they now?

279
00:30:30,580 --> 00:30:34,959
I don't know. After revolution
I tried to find out.

280
00:30:35,039 --> 00:30:39,586
Our village was burned to decay,
and people scattered.

281
00:30:39,667 --> 00:30:45,673
So, I've lost their trace. This is
all about it, Peter.

282
00:30:45,752 --> 00:30:46,879
Well.

283
00:30:47,254 --> 00:30:50,757
Here what, go!
Is time to rest for our troop.

284
00:30:50,797 --> 00:30:55,677
- And at dawn we'll make
your way towards Malinovka.
- Yes, Nazar Vasiljevich!

285
00:31:02,427 --> 00:31:16,983
A branchy and high oak
has grown in the open country.

286
00:31:17,058 --> 00:31:33,950
A nightingale sings a song
among his branches.

287
00:31:33,983 --> 00:31:49,499
He's not afraid of pain,
he sets his breast.

288
00:31:49,532 --> 00:31:59,542
It can be pulled out,
but only with his roots.

289
00:31:59,620 --> 00:32:13,092
Bur it can't be bowed, can't be bowed.

290
00:33:08,401 --> 00:33:09,443
Where've you been?

291
00:33:10,235 --> 00:33:13,530
- I've been looking for you..
- In "Camels"? Did your mother tell you?

292
00:33:13,570 --> 00:33:16,824
She told. But you weren't there.
Where've you been?

293
00:33:17,488 --> 00:33:20,825
Andrew, repeat after me:
"I promise".

294
00:33:21,657 --> 00:33:22,658
I promise.

295
00:33:22,741 --> 00:33:24,743
- That I won't ask.
- That I won't ask.

296
00:33:24,825 --> 00:33:26,201
Where've you been.

297
00:33:26,867 --> 00:33:29,203
It's a big secret. Do you promise?

298
00:33:29,285 --> 00:33:31,079
I promise. And where've you been?

299
00:33:32,161 --> 00:33:37,792
- Don't look at me like that.
- How do look at you?

300
00:33:37,872 --> 00:33:43,086
- If you love me, then believe me.
- I believe and love.

301
00:33:43,166 --> 00:33:48,964
But your Andrew must know
where've you been a whole night.

302
00:33:49,044 --> 00:33:55,426
If you'll ask one more time,
I'll drive you out of here.

303
00:33:58,173 --> 00:34:07,766
For the sake of our happiness, for the
sake of it, If you want us to be happy

304
00:34:07,845 --> 00:34:12,850
Don't ask me anything.

305
00:34:12,930 --> 00:34:23,858
Don't question me about anything.

306
00:34:23,935 --> 00:34:35,697
For the sake of your happiness,
If we want it.

307
00:34:35,774 --> 00:34:52,374
Don't ask me anything,
Don't question me about anything.

308
00:34:58,909 --> 00:35:04,498
- I keep silent till the wedding.
- So, listen to me.

309
00:35:04,537 --> 00:35:10,293
- It would be great a horse to get.
- Why do you need it?

310
00:35:10,373 --> 00:35:15,962
For what, for what,
will you tell me for what?

311
00:35:16,043 --> 00:35:22,633
I can't tell you, Irene.
It's my big secret.

312
00:35:25,255 --> 00:35:35,390
For the sake of our happiness, for the
sake of it, If you want it.

313
00:35:35,468 --> 00:35:52,526
Don't ask me anything,
Don't question me about anything.

314
00:35:52,601 --> 00:36:03,570
For the sake of our happiness,for the sake of it
if we want it.

315
00:36:03,648 --> 00:36:28,547
Don't ask me anything,
don't question me about anything.

316
00:36:30,826 --> 00:36:32,578
Nibble, nibble.

317
00:36:34,036 --> 00:36:35,996
Stop. I'll shoot.

318
00:36:42,373 --> 00:36:43,999
Stop.

319
00:36:45,792 --> 00:36:48,670
- Are you telling me this?
- Yes, who else.

320
00:36:48,709 --> 00:36:52,463
And I'm silly, I'm running.
it's all right for me to stay.

321
00:36:52,670 --> 00:36:55,214
- What do you want, sonny?
- Give me a horse.

322
00:36:55,254 --> 00:36:59,800
A horse? Where can I get it,
when I don't have even a half?

323
00:36:59,923 --> 00:37:01,716
- Don't have?
- Yes.

324
00:37:01,882 --> 00:37:04,176
- Then take off your boots.
- Boots?

325
00:37:04,633 --> 00:37:06,051
Take off.

326
00:37:06,133 --> 00:37:08,261
They are torn.

327
00:37:08,343 --> 00:37:11,096
And I have another pair
at home, new one.

328
00:37:11,178 --> 00:37:12,596
I'll bring you them in a moment.

329
00:37:12,679 --> 00:37:17,016
Where? Take off your boots.
Or I'll... bang!... -verstehen?

330
00:37:17,097 --> 00:37:19,891
Okay, I understand,
you don't have to shout.

331
00:37:19,974 --> 00:37:23,269
- I'll count to 3 : one...
- Put away your gun... two

332
00:37:23,350 --> 00:37:27,104
Here sonny, wear as you please.

333
00:37:31,062 --> 00:37:32,564
They are small for you.

334
00:37:32,646 --> 00:37:36,984
They fit me. I'm too big
for them Good boots.

335
00:37:39,732 --> 00:37:44,153
Hands up. The regime has changed.
Take off the boots.

336
00:37:44,318 --> 00:37:46,320
How can I take off the boots,
if my hands are up?

337
00:37:46,360 --> 00:37:48,904
- Take off. Or I'll kill you. One
- You won't.

338
00:37:48,987 --> 00:37:51,573
- Really, I'll kill. Two.
- You won't.

339
00:37:51,863 --> 00:37:55,116
- Why?
- It isn't loaded.

340
00:38:01,242 --> 00:38:08,624
That's right! Master stroke.
Who are you?

341
00:38:08,704 --> 00:38:11,039
- Jacob.
- Just Jacob?

342
00:38:11,122 --> 00:38:13,833
Notjust. But Jacob -gunner.

343
00:38:13,998 --> 00:38:16,834
The third right soldier,
turn left.

344
00:38:16,916 --> 00:38:21,254
Battery bear for action. The tube
number 15, sight 120 degrees.

345
00:38:21,334 --> 00:38:24,337
Battery fire! Bang! Bang! - missed.

346
00:38:26,254 --> 00:38:28,006
I'm moving from Austrian
captivity nach hause.

347
00:38:28,088 --> 00:38:29,715
- What?
- I'm going home.

348
00:38:30,089 --> 00:38:32,466
- Did they set you free?
- I ran away.

349
00:38:32,631 --> 00:38:35,176
- And for how long you've been going?
- Not so long, 18 months.

350
00:38:35,216 --> 00:38:36,217
And barefooted?

351
00:38:36,258 --> 00:38:40,137
No. Some bandit has taken
them off me this morning.

352
00:38:40,218 --> 00:38:42,304
Bandit. And who are you?

353
00:38:42,386 --> 00:38:45,514
A fair man took them off you
and from me - a bandit.

354
00:38:45,637 --> 00:38:47,764
It's not easier for me.

355
00:38:48,930 --> 00:38:51,600
- Where is your home?
- Not far now. In Yankov.

356
00:38:52,348 --> 00:38:55,059
- Beyond the mountain?
- Yes in the hollow.

357
00:38:55,892 --> 00:38:59,604
There are gardens over the lake.
And pears grow there.

358
00:38:59,685 --> 00:39:04,481
And pears are so tasty.

359
00:39:04,979 --> 00:39:07,940
And beyond the gardens - is the river,
and over the river - you'll a bridge.

360
00:39:08,023 --> 00:39:10,192
Yes? And two board lumber default there?

361
00:39:11,649 --> 00:39:13,568
Have you been there?

362
00:39:13,734 --> 00:39:16,820
- I've seen you somewhere.
- And I've seen you somewhere.

363
00:39:16,943 --> 00:39:19,488
Did you peep at
swimming girls?

364
00:39:19,569 --> 00:39:22,280
And they drag you I in the mire for this.

365
00:39:22,362 --> 00:39:23,197
- Behind the mill?
- Yes.

366
00:39:23,237 --> 00:39:24,655
- Where there's also steep?
- Yes.

367
00:39:24,697 --> 00:39:26,115
No, not me.

368
00:39:26,198 --> 00:39:29,367
Where that you who rode through Yankovka
on the bullock-cart and fell asleep.

369
00:39:29,449 --> 00:39:31,117
And bullocks were taken away?

370
00:39:31,200 --> 00:39:32,117
- Get bullocks?
- Yes.

371
00:39:32,201 --> 00:39:34,077
- And one with a stain.
- No, it's not me.

372
00:39:34,159 --> 00:39:35,160
- You're telling lies.
- Not me.

373
00:39:35,243 --> 00:39:37,287
And it's not you, when
you went to the front.

374
00:39:37,369 --> 00:39:40,289
And you fell down from the bridge,
and women took you out?

375
00:39:40,412 --> 00:39:44,750
- It's me.
- Compariots.

376
00:39:48,333 --> 00:39:52,545
You know, let's go to my house.
I'll give you bigger boots.

377
00:39:56,753 --> 00:40:00,340
lnteresting, how is there, in
Yankovka? ls it all quiet?

378
00:40:00,421 --> 00:40:04,300
I was kicking up, when my Yankovka
was burned to decay be Vrangel.

379
00:40:12,260 --> 00:40:14,888
Damn them all.

380
00:40:16,095 --> 00:40:18,681
- Where can I go?
- You have nowhere?

381
00:40:18,930 --> 00:40:20,598
Stop. Are you literate?

382
00:40:20,680 --> 00:40:21,807
- Who, me?
- Yes.

383
00:40:22,306 --> 00:40:24,892
Yes, I was writing love-letters
for each in the battery.

384
00:40:24,933 --> 00:40:29,646
Your 3 inch glimmer properly
to the point hit my heart...

385
00:40:29,726 --> 00:40:34,731
- In other words, Bang! Bang! - and missed.
- Good. You'll be a clerk.

386
00:40:34,812 --> 00:40:37,272
What?
You want a gunner become a clerk?

387
00:40:37,355 --> 00:40:39,524
- Well, an assistant.
- And does an assistant have many work?

388
00:40:39,773 --> 00:40:40,982
- Many.
- I can't.

389
00:40:41,023 --> 00:40:42,525
Why?

390
00:40:42,607 --> 00:40:45,193
My health isn't good.
I can't work as assistant.

391
00:40:45,275 --> 00:40:47,820
If want a job,
with less work.

392
00:40:47,901 --> 00:40:49,820
- I can be a chief.
- What chief?

393
00:40:49,860 --> 00:40:51,904
It doesn't matter.
Even if a garrison chief.

394
00:40:51,945 --> 00:40:53,321
And what garrison?

395
00:40:53,403 --> 00:40:55,155
We have only young girls and
women, but they are bellicose.

396
00:40:55,238 --> 00:40:57,824
And you tell that you don't have.
Then if there was a chief.

397
00:40:57,864 --> 00:41:00,742
Ok, then you'll be a chief
but also a clerk.

398
00:41:00,824 --> 00:41:02,784
- Pluralistically. Okay?
- Okay.

399
00:41:02,825 --> 00:41:06,411
- Bang! Bang!.... Verstehen?
- Sure

400
00:41:19,999 --> 00:41:22,710
Bless you, Jacob Alexandrovich.

401
00:41:27,211 --> 00:41:30,381
I'm so happy, so happy,
that you called in.

402
00:41:30,462 --> 00:41:32,548
My Nitchepore will have
assistance now.

403
00:41:32,630 --> 00:41:36,175
Because we have here only women.
And you know who women are.

404
00:41:36,257 --> 00:41:37,550
For example Trindichiha.

405
00:41:37,632 --> 00:41:40,385
When Trindichiha is angry,
she can do heaven knows what.

406
00:41:40,466 --> 00:41:43,636
She has such temperament,
if someone will hitch her.

407
00:41:43,718 --> 00:41:45,178
- She'll begin to do queer things...
- Ho-ho-ho...

408
00:41:45,219 --> 00:41:46,846
Don't hurry up.

409
00:41:47,595 --> 00:41:51,516
As always.
He never lets me to put in a word.

410
00:41:51,763 --> 00:41:53,056
Please eat, Jacob Alexandrovich.

411
00:41:53,139 --> 00:41:58,102
It's interesting for me, Garpina...
Excuse me, Garpina... Do...

412
00:41:58,183 --> 00:42:00,519
- Doremidotovna.
- Do-re-mi-dotovna.

413
00:42:00,600 --> 00:42:03,645
Can you tell me
have you ever had sick headaches?

414
00:42:03,686 --> 00:42:10,651
No, no one had, we have
only boredom here. Such boredom.

415
00:42:10,731 --> 00:42:13,984
I announce officially,
as a chief of this garrison.

416
00:42:14,065 --> 00:42:18,236
There will be no boredom.
We'll.... Bang! Bang!.... And it's passed.

417
00:42:23,403 --> 00:42:24,821
- Danke schon.
- What, what?

418
00:42:24,862 --> 00:42:27,573
- Thanks.
- You're welcome.

419
00:42:28,447 --> 00:42:31,700
Excuse me please.

420
00:42:32,949 --> 00:42:37,328
I'm an experienced person. I dance.
I know many songs.

421
00:42:37,409 --> 00:42:39,745
- What songs do you know?
- Many different.

422
00:42:39,827 --> 00:42:46,167
For example, « I don't care what to do :
to suffer or to enjoy».

423
00:42:46,204 --> 00:42:49,916
- I don't care.
- One moment. Here is another.

424
00:42:49,998 --> 00:42:57,005
All say that I'm flippant,
All say that I love many people.

425
00:42:57,085 --> 00:43:04,217
I loved ten people, and forty I stopped to love,
but I can't forget one person.

426
00:43:04,255 --> 00:43:07,383
- Do you know how to dance Gopack?
- Yes, but,

427
00:43:07,423 --> 00:43:10,634
Gopack nowadays is not fashionable.
I'm walked through the whole Europe.

428
00:43:10,716 --> 00:43:12,843
And I've never seen that anyone,
was dancing Gopack.

429
00:43:12,925 --> 00:43:19,932
Nowadays is fashionable simply
ugliness It's called "To that steppe".

430
00:43:19,970 --> 00:43:20,888
«To that steppe"?

431
00:43:20,970 --> 00:43:21,929
- Interested?
- Yes.

432
00:43:22,013 --> 00:43:25,016
I can show you.
You hand bitte.

433
00:43:27,432 --> 00:43:33,104
Get ready frau madam
I'll give you a first lesson.

434
00:43:33,518 --> 00:43:39,274
You should look in the sky.
And should jump like goat.

435
00:43:39,562 --> 00:43:45,151
Come! Boldly straight on.
With you figure it's great.

436
00:43:45,648 --> 00:43:50,945
Now this way, then this way.
I'm an expert in dancing.

437
00:43:51,777 --> 00:43:57,657
Continue ein, zwei, drei.
Do you want faster?

438
00:43:57,737 --> 00:44:03,743
Doner wetter?
Right on the corn.

439
00:44:03,823 --> 00:44:09,746
It's not easy to dance like this,
But it's more fashionable than Gopack.

440
00:44:09,826 --> 00:44:15,082
Now this way, then this way.
I'm an expert in dancing.

441
00:45:20,191 --> 00:45:22,777
What is it, this statue?

442
00:45:27,403 --> 00:45:31,865
Who are you? Why do you keep
silent, like a fish? Who are you?

443
00:45:32,239 --> 00:45:34,783
I'm a vagrant soldier,
unmounted infantryman.

444
00:45:35,031 --> 00:45:36,825
I'm going to my native land, to Kharkov.

445
00:45:38,324 --> 00:45:41,452
Stop, follow me. You're a prisoner.

446
00:45:41,535 --> 00:45:43,996
- Yes, what did you say?
- What.

447
00:45:45,452 --> 00:45:47,913
Go, go

448
00:45:54,082 --> 00:45:57,377
- Stop. lt that your harmonium?
- Yes.

449
00:45:57,458 --> 00:45:59,794
- Do you know how to play?
- Yes, sure.

450
00:46:00,042 --> 00:46:02,461
He, then play something for me.

451
00:46:08,380 --> 00:46:10,465
Look, compose.

452
00:46:10,548 --> 00:46:13,342
Compose something for me
something special.

453
00:46:13,382 --> 00:46:17,261
For my soul could open up,
and then close up again.

454
00:46:17,342 --> 00:46:19,595
- For Odessa, do you know?
- Try.

455
00:46:20,218 --> 00:46:24,764
I lived in Odessa
I swam in the Black Sea.

456
00:46:24,846 --> 00:46:33,855
All people on the beach knew me.
I sang verses and played guitar.

457
00:46:33,933 --> 00:46:42,775
I played with love. And now it's
clear, that the love was unlucky.

458
00:46:42,854 --> 00:46:51,613
And my heart burns ardently in my chest.
And now it's clear, Odessa is real,

459
00:46:51,691 --> 00:46:56,654
And we have the different way.

460
00:47:10,199 --> 00:47:11,409
You are a child prodigy.

461
00:47:11,491 --> 00:47:13,744
- And what's the matter?
- What the hell.

462
00:47:13,826 --> 00:47:18,581
Listen, soldier, whyam
I in such sympathize with you?

463
00:47:19,495 --> 00:47:22,540
Okay, you'll play today
on the wedding.

464
00:47:22,580 --> 00:47:24,957
Okay, I can play. Whose wedding?

465
00:47:25,040 --> 00:47:28,251
- Pan ataman Grecian Tavricheskiy.
- Wow.

466
00:47:28,333 --> 00:47:29,751
Maybe you didn't hear about him?

467
00:47:29,833 --> 00:47:33,253
Ha, I heard. It's the chief ataman
in the whole province.

468
00:47:33,335 --> 00:47:37,214
If he'll get a machine-gun, then
no one of our enemies will stay alive.

469
00:47:37,295 --> 00:47:40,757
And what do you think?
You think that we don't have machine-guns?

470
00:47:40,838 --> 00:47:42,632
We have...

471
00:47:43,965 --> 00:47:46,885
Somebody is overhearing us. Hey...

472
00:47:48,800 --> 00:47:49,343
Listen...

473
00:47:49,593 --> 00:47:52,930
Do you know how many machine-guns we
have? We have seven machine-guns.

474
00:47:53,011 --> 00:47:55,055
Really?
I'm a machine gunner myself.

475
00:47:55,137 --> 00:47:57,056
- Do you know how to repair them?
- Seeing what's broken.

476
00:47:57,137 --> 00:48:00,140
3 machine-guns are in order,
Other 3...

477
00:48:00,223 --> 00:48:03,893
One jams, other,
bobs up.

478
00:48:03,974 --> 00:48:06,852
And the third fires at one's own people.

479
00:48:06,934 --> 00:48:12,773
And the seventh, in secret from pan
ataman, I exchanged for this trousers.

480
00:48:12,853 --> 00:48:15,981
Look. How wonderful they are... really?

481
00:48:22,107 --> 00:48:25,027
Listen, soldier,
why am I so in love?

482
00:48:25,067 --> 00:48:27,444
- Hell knows.
- Join our band.

483
00:48:27,527 --> 00:48:29,237
I'll arrange a protege for you.

484
00:48:29,319 --> 00:48:32,364
No, I humbly thank you. We
have spent enough time in fighting.

485
00:48:32,403 --> 00:48:35,949
And then, how can we old men
measure swords with you boys. No. No.

486
00:48:36,030 --> 00:48:40,743
We have great boys.
Vile animals, just like me.

487
00:48:40,783 --> 00:48:41,992
No, no.

488
00:48:42,075 --> 00:48:48,081
Division. But not a whole
approximately...

489
00:48:51,287 --> 00:48:53,373
150 men will assemble.

490
00:48:53,413 --> 00:48:58,085
On the whole, we could assemble more
but pan ataman has very poor gold reserves.

491
00:48:58,165 --> 00:49:02,211
And boys began to disperse
And they are doing right.

492
00:49:02,292 --> 00:49:05,879
If it will continue in this way
I'll disperse also.

493
00:49:05,961 --> 00:49:08,880
All division is getting
drunk in the monastery.

494
00:49:08,920 --> 00:49:11,965
And I'm lest alone here.

495
00:49:13,381 --> 00:49:17,885
The wedding is today, in the evening.
You'll be playing.

496
00:49:17,966 --> 00:49:19,551
Don't let me down.

497
00:49:19,633 --> 00:49:22,886
Or I'll tear off your head,
and I'll say that it was so.

498
00:49:23,760 --> 00:49:26,763
Look, why am I l so in love?

499
00:49:31,305 --> 00:49:32,014
One-two, one-two.

500
00:49:32,097 --> 00:49:35,976
Down the river,
down the wide one.

501
00:49:36,057 --> 00:49:41,938
A grey drake is floating.
3 villages, 2 countries.

502
00:49:42,018 --> 00:49:47,816
Eight girls, and only me,
wherever the girls are going, I'm going with them.

503
00:49:47,896 --> 00:49:53,110
On the spot. One -two, One -two.
Battalion, stop. One -two.

504
00:49:54,149 --> 00:50:03,908
Stop. About turn. Stand at ease. Break up.
You can go and have a cigarette.

505
00:50:04,779 --> 00:50:06,739
We don't smoke.

506
00:50:08,656 --> 00:50:11,993
Jacob Alexandrovich, you,
as a chief should know.

507
00:50:12,074 --> 00:50:13,742
When the war ends?

508
00:50:13,825 --> 00:50:16,411
It's very interesting for me,
why do you ask about this?

509
00:50:16,659 --> 00:50:19,537
And why do you ask about this is
such untimely moment?

510
00:50:20,828 --> 00:50:23,414
Because to get our husbands,
back home Jacob Alexandrovich.

511
00:50:47,673 --> 00:50:50,718
- Who are you? Where are you coming from?
- From a war.

512
00:50:51,508 --> 00:50:54,428
Visit office and
fill in the form.

513
00:50:55,802 --> 00:51:02,517
- Wait, wait, wait soldier.
- Soldier play for us

514
00:51:13,685 --> 00:51:20,984
A broad steppe smokes from a fire.

515
00:51:21,063 --> 00:51:29,030
The songs are strew over with ashes.

516
00:51:29,109 --> 00:51:37,534
And with open wings,
like a wild bird.

517
00:51:37,613 --> 00:51:47,623
A soldier song flies over the land.

518
00:51:48,117 --> 00:51:55,041
And silently soldier will
look in the sky.

519
00:51:55,120 --> 00:52:02,836
He'll meet a harsh spring dawn.

520
00:52:03,083 --> 00:52:11,883
And hears a filed this soldier song.

521
00:52:11,961 --> 00:52:21,304
Regards from a native, far heart.

522
00:52:39,224 --> 00:52:43,353
- She is a soldier too?
- Widow. She's mysterious.

523
00:52:43,393 --> 00:52:56,906
And somewhere peel not quieten down hoofs
The dwelling is treated down, the grass is smoking.

524
00:52:56,981 --> 00:53:04,906
- The soldiers heart is broken
through with a splinter.
- Let me drink.

525
00:53:20,034 --> 00:53:23,621
What is with you soldier, are you sick?

526
00:53:26,537 --> 00:53:30,332
I'm tired. I'm coming from far away.

527
00:53:51,215 --> 00:53:55,469
And music besides.
Ataman ask her daughter in marriage.

528
00:53:56,342 --> 00:53:58,011
Daughter?

529
00:53:58,468 --> 00:54:07,185
When the moon was on the sky,land the fate was happy.

530
00:54:07,264 --> 00:54:15,856
Among a merry herd
a horse was walking at liberty.

531
00:54:15,934 --> 00:54:24,401
Among a merry herd
a horse was walking at liberty.

532
00:54:24,480 --> 00:54:32,822
You can walk my zealous horse.
One day they will catch you.

533
00:54:35,360 --> 00:54:39,323
Please let me. Kotovci have come.

534
00:54:40,070 --> 00:54:41,363
Mother.

535
00:54:45,364 --> 00:54:47,074
Red.

536
00:55:04,040 --> 00:55:05,166
- Jacob.
- Yes.

537
00:55:05,248 --> 00:55:08,335
Commander, the regime changes.

538
00:55:19,213 --> 00:55:20,381
Get down.

539
00:55:24,716 --> 00:55:26,718
Say something with all one's heart.

540
00:55:27,675 --> 00:55:32,889
My dear friends have come.
Me dear friends.

541
00:55:33,511 --> 00:55:34,971
They have come.

542
00:55:35,054 --> 00:55:37,222
In the Malinovka region
operates Grecian band.

543
00:55:37,305 --> 00:55:39,307
At the moment
it is situated in the monastery.

544
00:55:39,680 --> 00:55:42,642
In entrusted to me battalion
no incidents have happened.

545
00:55:42,682 --> 00:55:45,393
No killed, no injured,
no sick.

546
00:55:45,475 --> 00:55:49,062
The chief of Malinovka's garrison
Jacob Alexandrovich Boyko.

547
00:55:49,143 --> 00:55:52,730
As required a chief of this garrison,
and pluralistically a clerk.

548
00:55:52,811 --> 00:55:54,897
- Pluralistically. Verstehen?
- Verstehen.

549
00:56:01,690 --> 00:56:05,486
- Hello my friends.
- Hello.

550
00:56:08,694 --> 00:56:10,863
One's people.

551
00:56:25,160 --> 00:56:27,120
Why are you crying, my sweetie?

552
00:56:27,202 --> 00:56:33,667
What should I do? I haven't kissed
a boy for 35 years.

553
00:56:35,581 --> 00:56:37,375
Please, take it.

554
00:56:37,457 --> 00:56:40,293
Thank you. So girls
miss you miss boys?

555
00:56:41,709 --> 00:56:44,254
Don't you think boys that
you stay too long in the saddle?

556
00:58:02,121 --> 00:58:06,500
Commander, ataman Fatir
Beliasniy hangs around here.

557
00:58:09,291 --> 00:58:12,586
- Keep an eye on this monastery.
- Yes Sir!

558
00:58:46,515 --> 00:58:48,100
So Peter?

559
00:58:48,183 --> 00:58:50,935
Nazar Vasiljevich,
you must satisfy this request.

560
00:58:52,059 --> 00:58:55,438
You're a machine gunner, yes?
So where's your gun?

561
00:58:55,561 --> 00:59:01,358
If we had a machine gunner, then a
machine gun we'll bang! Bang! Verstehen?

562
00:59:04,523 --> 00:59:05,941
Take in the troop.

563
00:59:06,025 --> 00:59:07,776
- Lets go.
- Thank you.

564
00:59:31,828 --> 00:59:32,996
Get out.

565
00:59:34,162 --> 00:59:37,665
I became frozen just like as I were on a sea bottom.

566
00:59:38,539 --> 00:59:42,293
To the monastery. Tell Grecian,
that they have only 31 people.

567
00:59:42,583 --> 00:59:47,755
25 people are getting drunk and
6 are carrying their duties.
2 machine guns. He'll kill them easily

568
00:59:49,961 --> 00:59:54,090
- What is it on you?
- It's a jacket.

569
00:59:54,129 --> 00:59:57,925
Give me, I'll try on.
Give it to me to wear.

570
01:00:09,178 --> 01:00:12,306
Oh great. It's just cut for me.

571
01:00:12,679 --> 01:00:15,057
I'll better die,
than I'll join Grecian band.

572
01:00:17,807 --> 01:00:19,642
The troop will hide in the ambush.

573
01:00:21,433 --> 01:00:24,144
We need this wedding for
our common business.

574
01:00:24,852 --> 01:00:28,981
Don't be afraid, we won't let
you be offended. I will be there also.

575
01:00:29,521 --> 01:00:31,856
But remember, daughter, you don't know me.

576
01:00:32,855 --> 01:00:34,816
You wouldn't permit you daughter do that.

577
01:00:41,068 --> 01:00:44,822
I'll for you, my dear,
break anyone's neck.

578
01:00:48,154 --> 01:00:51,282
- Don't you believe?
- I believe.

579
01:01:05,121 --> 01:01:15,923
Here, no one will hear I my complaints.

580
01:01:16,000 --> 01:01:27,387
Even if I couldn't seize them
in my heart.

581
01:01:27,463 --> 01:01:37,140
Don't dim my tears and my
sight don't weary, grief.

582
01:01:37,218 --> 01:01:48,604
Is it possible that only disgrace
is lest for this poor girl?

583
01:01:59,353 --> 01:02:10,239
Here, no one will hear I my complaints.

584
01:02:10,316 --> 01:02:20,785
Even if I couldn't seize them
in my heart.

585
01:02:20,863 --> 01:02:31,290
Do not haze the sight my tears.
Do not stew my sorrow.

586
01:02:31,784 --> 01:02:48,843
- Is it possible that only
disgrace is left for me in this life.
- Only disgrace?

587
01:02:58,838 --> 01:03:01,632
You hand bitte dritte.

588
01:03:03,424 --> 01:03:09,805
Battalion, tube number 15, sight
120 degrees, prepare for a dance.

589
01:03:44,776 --> 01:03:50,406
The wedding will be
special.

590
01:04:38,008 --> 01:04:40,636
Come in freeman
I'll feed you.

591
01:04:40,718 --> 01:04:42,845
- I don't like boiled buckwheat.
- It's with butter.

592
01:04:42,927 --> 01:04:44,011
I eat only with milk.

593
01:04:44,095 --> 01:04:46,222
And I don't care with
what it is.

594
01:04:46,304 --> 01:04:51,476
Please go, I ask,
I ask politely.

595
01:04:51,973 --> 01:04:55,226
Receive this dear guest.

596
01:04:55,392 --> 01:04:56,893
Fell.

597
01:05:16,943 --> 01:05:21,155
Quick, saddle horses.

598
01:05:22,654 --> 01:05:23,613
Commander.

599
01:05:23,696 --> 01:05:25,739
I'm sorry father, I have no time,
bandits are too close.

600
01:05:25,822 --> 01:05:28,908
- What is going on?
- You, father, don't worry. Good luck.

601
01:05:28,990 --> 01:05:31,117
Good luck.

602
01:05:34,284 --> 01:05:39,914
When you see my signal with this
small lamp, light this haystack.

603
01:05:40,161 --> 01:05:42,122
Yes Sir! I'll do that.

604
01:05:48,623 --> 01:05:50,500
Let's go.

605
01:05:51,625 --> 01:05:54,128
Regime changes again.

606
01:06:02,839 --> 01:06:07,385
We'll go bravely to the fight.
For the power of Soviets.

607
01:06:07,465 --> 01:06:10,927
And we'll die all for one
in the fight for this.

608
01:06:11,175 --> 01:06:13,845
Gone. I'm late.

609
01:06:14,385 --> 01:06:17,805
I've cooked patties for them.
Maybe you'll taste?

610
01:06:17,846 --> 01:06:21,016
- With great pleasure.
- With poppies.

611
01:06:21,097 --> 01:06:26,477
- I like them.
- They are gone, and you've stayed.

612
01:06:27,141 --> 01:06:30,019
Stay Jacob Alexandrovich.

613
01:06:33,102 --> 01:06:37,773
You only remind me my
favorite howitzer.

614
01:06:37,855 --> 01:06:41,483
My favorite reliable howitzer.

615
01:06:41,897 --> 01:06:44,066
Where is it,
your favorite howitzer?

616
01:06:44,149 --> 01:06:46,067
Was perished in unequal fight.

617
01:06:46,108 --> 01:06:49,320
You're a widower, Jacob Alexandrovich?

618
01:06:51,485 --> 01:06:54,238
- Oh.
- Are you okay, Jacob Alexandrovich?

619
01:06:54,321 --> 01:06:56,364
Personal contusion.

620
01:07:00,239 --> 01:07:04,660
You 3 inch eyes,
neatly hit.

621
01:07:04,742 --> 01:07:10,205
And sparked volcanic fire
in my heart. Bang! Bang!

622
01:07:16,622 --> 01:07:21,335
I've been walking through the foreign land.

623
01:07:21,416 --> 01:07:25,211
I've been dreaming of a native land.

624
01:07:25,293 --> 01:07:29,422
I've been going throught
the forests at night.

625
01:07:29,502 --> 01:07:32,923
I like here and I like you.

626
01:07:33,087 --> 01:07:37,217
Oh, sehr gut. Excuse me madam.

627
01:07:38,049 --> 01:07:42,720
Once we'll live in live in our land.

628
01:07:42,967 --> 01:07:46,888
Once a nightingale will begin to sing.

629
01:07:47,136 --> 01:07:51,349
You can dream to me all nights.

630
01:07:51,429 --> 01:07:54,933
But my heart will tell you one.

631
01:07:55,014 --> 01:07:59,810
We are judged to love but once.

632
01:08:00,017 --> 01:08:04,146
You'll fall in love,
and will never regret.

633
01:08:04,185 --> 01:08:08,189
Days and nights pass through,
but love still lives

634
01:08:08,270 --> 01:08:12,358
They share theirjob and care on Shanks'.

635
01:08:12,439 --> 01:08:16,318
And like a water fall their
time still goes.

636
01:08:16,399 --> 01:08:20,529
And their far way
leads them to happiness.

637
01:08:20,609 --> 01:08:24,821
The anxiety will be forgotten
with you my friend.

638
01:08:24,903 --> 01:08:28,907
You'll fall in love,
and will never regret.

639
01:08:28,988 --> 01:08:33,284
Days and nights pass through,
but love still lives

640
01:08:48,330 --> 01:08:51,083
What's with you? Let's go, let's go.

641
01:09:36,686 --> 01:09:38,729
Did you see Kotovci?

642
01:09:40,521 --> 01:09:43,399
- I saw.
- Get up. Get up.

643
01:09:43,480 --> 01:09:45,232
Why are you angry?

644
01:09:45,314 --> 01:09:47,567
- Did you serve bread to Kotovskiy?
- I've served.

645
01:09:47,649 --> 01:09:50,527
One moment. Why didn't
you serve bread to me?

646
01:09:50,608 --> 01:09:53,653
They've come with peace.
And you swooped down.

647
01:09:53,734 --> 01:09:56,112
- Swooped down? And did they strike?
- Let's go.

648
01:09:56,194 --> 01:10:00,824
You can put 500, 10000,
15000 and they will go anyway.

649
01:10:00,905 --> 01:10:04,117
- And they went.
- Ah, so you'll act like this?

650
01:10:04,198 --> 01:10:07,034
Papandopala.
- I'm here, Greg. I'm here

651
01:10:07,116 --> 01:10:09,493
Thrash him.

652
01:10:09,826 --> 01:10:14,247
It was me.
Boys give him a thrashing.

653
01:10:14,327 --> 01:10:16,621
Grannies, what is going on?

654
01:10:16,704 --> 01:10:17,872
Gridko.

655
01:10:26,375 --> 01:10:29,920
- Let this old man go.
- Don't become angry, let him go.

656
01:10:32,210 --> 01:10:35,297
- Let him go.
- Let him go.

657
01:10:35,712 --> 01:10:39,299
For you, Irene,
I'll do wrong.

658
01:10:40,548 --> 01:10:41,924
Accompany my bride to
the bedchamber.

659
01:10:42,007 --> 01:10:44,259
Let her change her dress for
the wedding. Pink, help her.

660
01:10:44,508 --> 01:10:47,386
Okay, let's go.

661
01:10:47,634 --> 01:10:49,803
Oh Greg, why am I so in love?

662
01:10:49,886 --> 01:10:52,972
- Irene.
- Get back.

663
01:10:57,638 --> 01:11:00,433
Fried chicken,
boiled chicken

664
01:11:00,474 --> 01:11:04,060
A chicken also wants to live.

665
01:11:06,934 --> 01:11:11,981
Daughter, why do you behave so?
We've hidden you, we've saved you.

666
01:11:12,062 --> 01:11:15,357
I don't need anything mother.
I was doing this of my own will.

667
01:11:23,650 --> 01:11:26,445
- And Andrew?
- Don't tell me anything about him.

668
01:11:29,403 --> 01:11:32,490
Get dressed. Quickly.

669
01:11:36,114 --> 01:11:38,200
Marusik.

670
01:11:40,492 --> 01:11:46,539
Pan ataman Grecian Tavricheskiy
invites you all to his palace.

671
01:11:53,664 --> 01:11:56,042
Well Marusik.

672
01:12:09,755 --> 01:12:11,715
Here you are. Here you are.

673
01:12:11,756 --> 01:12:14,675
Excuse me, pan ataman,
according to the order.

674
01:12:14,757 --> 01:12:19,929
We have wonderful music I and
as a performer this genius.

675
01:12:20,176 --> 01:12:22,804
Press the keys. Sell the goods.

676
01:12:26,388 --> 01:12:27,722
Composer.

677
01:12:27,805 --> 01:12:32,142
Let's dance
Let's wide a circle.

678
01:12:32,224 --> 01:12:36,395
Let's make a show,
Hey, tap with heels.

679
01:12:36,475 --> 01:12:40,562
Well dear madam,
Don't spare your foot.

680
01:12:40,644 --> 01:12:44,940
Delight us
with your dance.

681
01:13:00,820 --> 01:13:02,405
Nazar.

682
01:13:06,614 --> 01:13:09,117
Wait, something is wrong here.

683
01:13:10,825 --> 01:13:13,160
I'm not Nazar.

684
01:13:18,078 --> 01:13:20,497
You're wrong soldier.

685
01:13:34,085 --> 01:13:39,215
No, no. lt seemed to me.
I've been waiting for him for 15 years.

686
01:13:40,046 --> 01:13:41,589
Papandopala.

687
01:13:42,547 --> 01:13:45,508
- What Greg?
- Search him.

688
01:13:50,634 --> 01:13:53,887
Show me what you've got in your pockets.

689
01:14:01,222 --> 01:14:02,974
O-la-la.

690
01:14:03,056 --> 01:14:09,354
What you doing, composer?
You're, oh...

691
01:14:10,768 --> 01:14:14,439
Greg. It's brittle, Greg.

692
01:14:16,938 --> 01:14:18,398
Seize him.

693
01:14:40,324 --> 01:14:44,619
Baron Vrangel plenipotentiary,
staff-captain Chechil.

694
01:15:01,625 --> 01:15:05,295
Greg, do you have a stamp? Yes.

695
01:15:06,585 --> 01:15:09,129
Ataman Grecian Tavricheskiy.

696
01:15:23,009 --> 01:15:27,597
Finally, we've been waiting for you.

697
01:15:28,262 --> 01:15:33,893
And now, when baron Vrangel
carries on hard fights with Red Cavalry.

698
01:15:33,930 --> 01:15:38,101
You hid in the base
and you're robbing people.

699
01:15:38,725 --> 01:15:45,398
Please quiet. Nothing is gone,
my boys.

700
01:15:45,436 --> 01:15:48,064
For your ataman
Grecian Tavricheskiy.

701
01:15:48,146 --> 01:15:50,357
Hurrah!

702
01:15:50,438 --> 01:15:54,651
- For our glory!
- Hurrah!

703
01:15:54,732 --> 01:15:57,485
Papandopala. Bring the wine.

704
01:16:02,653 --> 01:16:09,701
The hour of meeting has come,
I'm burning all over.

705
01:16:09,781 --> 01:16:14,243
I'm thinking about you my darling.

706
01:16:14,324 --> 01:16:21,498
Be tender with me,
take it easy with me.

707
01:16:21,577 --> 01:16:27,959
Blast you. Blast you.
Blast you.

708
01:16:35,125 --> 01:16:41,632
I can see you're so clumsy.

709
01:16:41,711 --> 01:16:46,925
You're only looking in my eyes
with prayer and sorrow.

710
01:16:47,005 --> 01:16:56,890
Nevertheless dear friend,
stay with me.

711
01:16:56,969 --> 01:17:04,226
Very well,.
Blast you, blast you.

712
01:17:17,103 --> 01:17:20,314
- Look, is it real?
- Silver.

713
01:17:20,396 --> 01:17:23,190
Yes? Will you sell it?

714
01:17:23,273 --> 01:17:29,320
- You must be joking.
- I'll give one million for it

715
01:17:29,525 --> 01:17:32,444
- They are old, Katrin.
- No, valid.

716
01:17:32,527 --> 01:17:33,987
Here is my signature and a stamp.

717
01:17:34,069 --> 01:17:38,073
Minister of finance and aide-de-camp
Papandopala from Odessa.

718
01:17:38,153 --> 01:17:42,408
Here is your million. Look,
take them. I'll crayon more for myself.

719
01:17:42,864 --> 01:17:45,325
I won't sell, leave me alone.

720
01:18:21,716 --> 01:18:23,551
Andrew is there.

721
01:18:25,593 --> 01:18:30,014
- For the pan ataman's bride!
- Hurrah!

722
01:18:33,637 --> 01:18:38,184
- Do you know, who is it?
- I know. Commander of Kotovci, mother.

723
01:18:40,348 --> 01:18:43,810
You don't know everything. It's your father.

724
01:18:46,602 --> 01:18:50,564
Give me back.
All the same, I'll kill Grecian.

725
01:18:51,353 --> 01:18:53,689
You'll bury Irene and yourself.

726
01:19:01,150 --> 01:19:03,194
My soul tells me that
it wasn't Chechil.

727
01:19:03,276 --> 01:19:06,321
Let's go to the monastery
put the knife to his throat and find out.

728
01:19:06,402 --> 01:19:09,489
No, I'll bury him alive.

729
01:19:09,570 --> 01:19:11,530
You better take a look
at my bride.

730
01:19:11,571 --> 01:19:14,657
- She has a wonderful plait.
- I know.

731
01:19:14,698 --> 01:19:19,077
I'll bring her down, I'll spoil her
plait with tar, and cut with my sabre.

732
01:19:19,116 --> 01:19:22,953
For the glory of the Malinovka's
wedding will spread on a whole land.

733
01:19:23,035 --> 01:19:26,747
Have fun, my boys.

734
01:19:26,912 --> 01:19:31,791
Greg, can you solve
one my problem.

735
01:19:31,872 --> 01:19:36,168
Would you observe how a
Vrangel beat me?

736
01:19:36,249 --> 01:19:41,379
- If a Vrangel...
- Yes,... my muzzle.

737
01:19:41,460 --> 01:19:42,961
Greg.

738
01:19:44,461 --> 01:19:48,548
- And I'll tell you that it has happened.
- Leave me alone.

739
01:19:57,926 --> 01:20:05,683
Have fun my boys.
Have fun.

740
01:20:19,894 --> 01:20:22,563
Give me a jacket.

741
01:20:23,813 --> 01:20:30,110
What are you doing, robber?
Bandit.You're robbing your friends?

742
01:20:30,190 --> 01:20:32,442
Bad father.

743
01:20:49,157 --> 01:20:52,202
Do you stand sentinel, bandit?.

744
01:21:12,751 --> 01:21:16,338
- Sour cream.
- Stay away. Bombs in it.

745
01:21:16,420 --> 01:21:18,505
What? It's me Papandopala.

746
01:21:18,754 --> 01:21:22,550
Listen, I don't like I local regime.

747
01:21:22,631 --> 01:21:26,176
My heart tells me
that revolution is about to begin.

748
01:21:26,216 --> 01:21:30,679
- And who were you at peaceful times?
- I had many professions.

749
01:21:30,759 --> 01:21:34,847
And due to them
I was in criminal investigation.

750
01:21:34,928 --> 01:21:36,555
And who were you at peaceful times?

751
01:21:36,637 --> 01:21:41,058
I was in police. Don't be afraid.
We don't bother ours.

752
01:21:42,723 --> 01:21:47,353
Hey, show me you hands. Go go. So!

753
01:21:48,642 --> 01:21:51,311
So you're telling that
there are bombs in it.

754
01:21:54,395 --> 01:21:56,480
It's my cloakroom attendant.

755
01:21:56,563 --> 01:21:59,482
Hey you, bandit.
This all is mine.

756
01:21:59,523 --> 01:22:01,942
All yours? Am I not a man?

757
01:22:02,649 --> 01:22:04,651
- Take away your knife.
- I'll thrust you.

758
01:22:04,734 --> 01:22:08,112
Take away. Once you begin
a fight and you won't stop it.

759
01:22:09,902 --> 01:22:12,530
- Let's do it fairly. In half
- Won't you cheat me?

760
01:22:12,611 --> 01:22:14,363
You know me.

761
01:22:15,071 --> 01:22:19,909
This is for you. This is for me.

762
01:22:20,449 --> 01:22:24,077
This is for you.
This is for you again.

763
01:22:24,826 --> 01:22:26,911
This is for you twice again.

764
01:22:29,161 --> 01:22:32,080
What are you grabbing?
What are you grabbing?

765
01:22:32,996 --> 01:22:35,206
I don't wear that style.

766
01:22:42,917 --> 01:22:45,837
Did I deprive my share from me?

767
01:22:49,211 --> 01:22:50,671
Fairly?

768
01:22:51,921 --> 01:22:59,637
Pan Chechil, we'll have a good time
and in the morning we'll go to one quiet place.

769
01:23:00,550 --> 01:23:03,678
- Will have a good time.
- Thank you.

770
01:23:06,344 --> 01:23:12,100
Baron Vrangel has everything made in England.
A present for Pan ataman Tavricheskiy.

771
01:23:12,181 --> 01:23:14,641
Thank you.

772
01:24:20,419 --> 01:24:24,507
Stop. Enough.

773
01:24:28,382 --> 01:24:31,051
Let's go.

774
01:24:49,724 --> 01:24:52,352
Let's go to the bedroom. Have a rest
I and then right to the monast.

775
01:24:52,601 --> 01:24:53,686
Do you hear Irene,
let's go to the bedroom.

776
01:24:56,895 --> 01:25:04,027
- Wait. You promised to do it fairly.
- Promised.Pink.

777
01:25:04,773 --> 01:25:06,858
- Do you have a priest here?
- Yes.

778
01:25:06,941 --> 01:25:09,944
- Bring him here.
- Impossible

779
01:25:10,317 --> 01:25:12,194
Oh. Damn it!!

780
01:25:12,443 --> 01:25:19,409
Pan ataman, horses are drunk
and boys are harnessed.

781
01:25:22,156 --> 01:25:24,158
I'll kill them

782
01:25:25,032 --> 01:25:30,371
Ehh,Greg. Why
was I so in love with you?

783
01:25:30,451 --> 01:25:36,791
Where are you Marusia,
With whom are you walking?

784
01:25:36,871 --> 01:25:42,168
You've betrayed me,
And you're beating him.

785
01:26:01,465 --> 01:26:04,760
- Mother.
- Let her go.

786
01:26:04,842 --> 01:26:08,387
Go away.

787
01:26:09,052 --> 01:26:11,096
Leave me alone.

788
01:26:13,263 --> 01:26:14,764
Hold it.

789
01:27:07,412 --> 01:27:09,414
Nazar.

790
01:27:29,422 --> 01:27:35,094
Kotovci are coming! Kotovci!

791
01:29:13,052 --> 01:29:16,556
Nor from my battalion. Stop.

792
01:29:20,223 --> 01:29:23,059
- Oh, frau madam
- The last word.

793
01:29:23,140 --> 01:29:27,728
I surrender. Voluntary. Listen,
why am I so in love?

794
01:30:48,554 --> 01:30:52,933
I've got to go. Saddle the horses.

795
01:30:53,307 --> 01:30:56,226
- Don't hurry up.
- Verstehen.

796
01:31:06,395 --> 01:31:14,153
When the moon was on the sky,
and the fate was happy.

797
01:31:14,399 --> 01:31:22,449
Among a merry herd
a horse was walking at liberty.

798
01:31:22,528 --> 01:31:24,113
Among a merry herd
a horse was walking at liberty.

799
01:31:24,196 --> 01:31:38,460
You can walk my zealous horse.
One day they will catch you.

800
01:31:38,535 --> 01:31:47,169
One day they will saddle you.
They will saddle.

801
01:31:53,000 --> 01:31:55,795
The regime will change no more.
