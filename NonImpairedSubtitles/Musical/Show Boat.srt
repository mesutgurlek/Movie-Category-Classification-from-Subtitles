beat you to death.

You'd better be
nice to me,

or you'll
be sorry.

109

I said, stay away
from my wife.

And you protecting her!

130

One thing
i'm thankful for...
magnolia wasn't there.

131
00:07:27,364 --> 00:07:29,097
I don't want my daughter
mixed up with you

132
00:07:29,165 --> 00:07:30,631
or anybody like you.

133
00:07:30,700 --> 00:07:32,666
Mrs. Hawks,
please don't say that.

134
00:07:32,734 --> 00:07:35,801
Nola... nola's just like
a little sister to me.

135
00:07:35,870 --> 00:07:38,170
Mr. Hawks, if i've
got to stop seeing her,

136
00:07:38,237 --> 00:07:40,338
i just can't
stay on the show boat.

137
00:07:40,404 --> 00:07:41,838
I just can't!

138
00:07:41,907 --> 00:07:44,006
Now you done it.
Now you done it!

139

Oh, captain andy,

141
00:07:47,643 --> 00:07:49,978
if julie goes,
could i try
for the lead?

142
00:07:50,044 --> 00:07:51,578
Why, elly... ha ha ha!

143
00:07:51,645 --> 00:07:54,580
There ain't a funnier
gal on the river
than you are.

144

Oh, captain andy,
don't!

145
00:07:56,581 --> 00:08:00,017
Don't stamp your foot down
on real acting ability!

146

Leave go
my husband's knee!

147
00:08:01,685 --> 00:08:04,720
And you! You think more
of your show boat crew

148
00:08:04,786 --> 00:08:07,320
than you do of your own
daughter's upbringing.

149
00:08:07,389 --> 00:08:09,955
Where i come from,
no decent body

150
00:08:10,024 --> 00:08:12,724
would touch
this show boat riffraff
with a 10-foot pole,

151
00:08:12,791 --> 00:08:15,158
let alone
having their daughters
mixed up with them.

152
00:08:15,227 --> 00:08:18,628
I'll have more
to say to you later.

Just one big,
happy family.

[Man]
 who cares if my boat
goes upstream 

156
00:08:30,836 --> 00:08:37,006
 or if the gale bids me go
with the river's flow? 

157
00:08:37,073 --> 00:08:41,275
 i drift along with my fancy 

158
00:08:41,342 --> 00:08:44,077
 sometimes i thank
my lucky stars

00:08:49,114 --> 00:08:50,548
I bet he's
an aristocrat.

162
00:08:50,615 --> 00:08:52,215
Look at the cracks
in his shoes.

163
00:08:52,283 --> 00:08:57,818
... wonder, "where's
the mate for me?" 

164
00:08:57,886 --> 00:09:00,153
hello.

165
00:09:00,988 --> 00:09:02,688
How do you do?

166
00:09:02,756 --> 00:09:04,023
Do you live here?

167
00:09:04,089 --> 00:09:06,390
Oh, no.
I'm just a wayfarer
along the river.

168
00:09:06,458 --> 00:09:08,525
So am i. Which way
are you going?

169
00:09:08,593 --> 00:09:10,426
Either way.
Where are you going?

170
00:09:10,494 --> 00:09:11,894
Anywhere papa
gives shows.

171
00:09:11,961 --> 00:09:13,527
Oh, are you
a player?

172
00:09:13,596 --> 00:09:16,062
Like on the piano?
Yes, i play a little.

173
00:09:16,131 --> 00:09:17,697
Was that you
i heard?

174
00:09:17,766 --> 00:09:19,866
Yes, that was me.

175
00:09:19,933 --> 00:09:20,933
What a pity.

176
00:09:21,000 --> 00:09:22,567
What did you say, mister?

177
00:09:22,635 --> 00:09:24,569
When i asked if you
were a player,

178
00:09:24,635 --> 00:09:26,236
i meant,
are you an actress?

179
00:09:26,304 --> 00:09:29,938
Oh! Oh, no.
But i'd give anything
if i could be.

180
00:09:30,006 --> 00:09:31,239
Why?

181
00:09:31,307 --> 00:09:33,941
Because you can
make believe so many
wonderful things

182
00:09:34,008 --> 00:09:35,675
that never happen
in real life.

183
00:09:35,742 --> 00:09:37,642
Oh, but wonderful things
do happen.

184
00:09:37,711 --> 00:09:39,144
Why, this very day,

185
00:09:39,211 --> 00:09:41,245
i was walking
upon the levee,
feeling blue,

186
00:09:41,314 --> 00:09:42,913
and suddenly,
i looked up, and...

187
00:09:42,980 --> 00:09:44,447
i must go now.

188
00:09:44,515 --> 00:09:45,847
Oh, why?

189
00:09:45,916 --> 00:09:48,317
You're talking to me,
and i don't know you.

190
00:09:48,383 --> 00:09:49,717
Does that
really matter?

191
00:09:49,785 --> 00:09:51,184
No. Not to me.

192
00:09:51,253 --> 00:09:52,953
If you like to
make believe things,

193
00:09:53,019 --> 00:09:54,620
make believe
we know each other.

194
00:09:54,688 --> 00:09:57,488
Yes! We haven't
seen each other
for 75 years,

195
00:09:57,556 --> 00:09:59,424
and you're
my long-lost nephew.

196

<i>There's a scene like that
in the village drunkard.</i>

197
00:10:02,359 --> 00:10:04,627
Oh, no. 75 years
is too long.

198
00:10:04,694 --> 00:10:06,627
Besides, you know,
i don't think

199
00:10:06,696 --> 00:10:08,862
i'd like the idea of
being your nephew.

200
00:10:08,929 --> 00:10:10,496
Let's suppose
we've just met.

201
00:10:10,564 --> 00:10:12,564
Well, we really have.

202
00:10:12,632 --> 00:10:16,567
Well... let's suppose
we've fallen in love
at first sight.

203
00:10:16,635 --> 00:10:23,938
 only make believe
i love you 

204
00:10:24,006 --> 00:10:30,075
 only make believe
that you love me 

205
00:10:30,142 --> 00:10:35,812

in pretending 

206
00:10:35,879 --> 00:10:42,716
 wouldn't you? Wouldn't i?
Wouldn't we?

 make believe
our lips are blending 

208
00:10:53,057 --> 00:10:56,591
 or two or three 

209
00:10:56,659 --> 00:11:03,895

make believe i love you

 for to tell the truth,
i do 

211
00:11:13,036 --> 00:11:16,937
 the game
of just supposing 

212
00:11:17,005 --> 00:11:20,940
 is the sweetest
game i know 

213
00:11:21,008 --> 00:11:24,709
 our dreams
are more romantic 

214
00:11:24,776 --> 00:11:27,777
 than the world
we see 

215
00:11:27,845 --> 00:11:30,246
 and if the things
we dream about 

216
00:11:30,313 --> 00:11:34,515
 don't happen
to be so 

217
00:11:34,583 --> 00:11:41,152
 that's just
an unimportant
technicality 

218
00:11:41,220 --> 00:11:43,920
 though the cold
and brutal fact is 

219
00:11:43,987 --> 00:11:47,355
 you and i
have never met

 we need not
mind conventions,
ps and qs

 if we
put our thoughts
in practice 

222
00:11:56,496 --> 00:11:59,796
 we can banish
all regret

 imagining most
anything we choose 

224
00:12:11,605 --> 00:12:19,709
 we could
make believe
i love you 

225
00:12:19,777 --> 00:12:26,080
 we could make believe
that you love me 

226
00:12:26,148 --> 00:12:35,285

i love you

Nothing serious,

 i'm tired of livin'
and scared of dyin' 

316
00:19:06,027 --> 00:19:21,734
 but old man river,
he just keeps rollin' along 

317
00:19:25,638 --> 00:19:27,939
[julie]
Don't tell your mother
i met you here.

318
00:19:28,006 --> 00:19:29,239
Why?

319
00:19:29,308 --> 00:19:31,841
Never mind. Tell me
about this man.
Who is he?

320
00:19:31,908 --> 00:19:34,143
Well, i don't know.
He was standing
on the wharf,

321
00:19:34,209 --> 00:19:36,644
and i was standing
on the top deck,

322
00:19:36,712 --> 00:19:39,346
and he looked
so different from
everybody else

323
00:19:39,413 --> 00:19:40,880
and so beautiful.

324
00:19:40,948 --> 00:19:42,380
Julie, he said
he liked me.

325
00:19:42,449 --> 00:19:44,516
You think
he meant it?

326
00:19:44,582 --> 00:19:46,350
I don't know
as i like you

327
00:19:46,418 --> 00:19:48,985
falling in love
with some man
no one's heard of.

328
00:19:49,053 --> 00:19:52,054
Suppose he turned out
to be a no-account
river fellow?

329
00:19:52,121 --> 00:19:54,854
If he was
no-account,
i'd stop loving him.

330
00:19:54,923 --> 00:19:56,389
Oh, no, you wouldn't.

331
00:19:56,457 --> 00:20:00,158
Once a girl like you
starts to love a man,
she don't stop so easy.

332
00:20:00,226 --> 00:20:03,594
Well, couldn't you
stop loving steve
if he treated you mean?

333
00:20:03,661 --> 00:20:06,395
No, honey.
No matter what he did.

334
00:20:06,463 --> 00:20:08,331
Why do you
love steve?

335
00:20:08,398 --> 00:20:11,632
Oh, i don't know.
He's such a bad actor
on the stage,

336
00:20:11,700 --> 00:20:13,199
and he thinks
he's so good.

337
00:20:13,268 --> 00:20:14,901
Maybe that's
why i love him.

338
00:20:14,969 --> 00:20:17,836
You see, nola,
love is such
a funny thing.

339
00:20:17,904 --> 00:20:19,437
There's no sense
to it.

340
00:20:19,505 --> 00:20:21,304
That's why you've
got to be careful

341
00:20:21,373 --> 00:20:22,939
when it creeps up
on you.

342
00:20:23,007 --> 00:20:26,240
It's like the thing
you always sing about
on our walks.

343
00:20:26,309 --> 00:20:30,277
 fish gotta swim,
birds gotta fly 

344
00:20:30,345 --> 00:20:34,713
 i gotta love one man
till i die 

345
00:20:34,780 --> 00:20:41,450
 can't help lovin'
that man of mine 

346
00:20:41,518 --> 00:20:43,052
that's it.

347
00:20:43,119 --> 00:20:47,020
 tell me he's lazy,
tell me he's slow 

348
00:20:47,089 --> 00:20:51,390
 tell me i'm crazy,
maybe i know 

349
00:20:51,458 --> 00:20:58,194
 can't help lovin'
that man of mine 

350
00:20:58,261 --> 00:20:59,862
how come you all
know that song?

351
00:20:59,929 --> 00:21:01,730
Why? Do you
know it, queenie?

352
00:21:01,797 --> 00:21:03,598
Sure, i does,
but i only heard

353
00:21:03,665 --> 00:21:05,099
colored folks
sing it.

354
00:21:05,166 --> 00:21:07,100
Sounds funny
for miss julie
to know it.

355
00:21:07,167 --> 00:21:09,101
Julie sings it
all the time.

356
00:21:09,168 --> 00:21:10,736
Can you sing
the whole thing?

357
00:21:10,802 --> 00:21:13,803
Course i can.
What's so funny about that?

358
00:21:13,872 --> 00:21:18,406
 oh, listen, sister,
i love my mister man 

359
00:21:18,475 --> 00:21:21,009
 and i can't
tell you why 

360
00:21:21,075 --> 00:21:26,545
 there ain't no reason
why i should love that man 

361
00:21:27,813 --> 00:21:29,279
 it must be somethin'

362
00:21:29,347 --> 00:21:34,517
 that the angels
done plan 

363
00:21:34,584 --> 00:21:38,252
 fish gotta swim,
birds gotta fly 

364
00:21:38,320 --> 00:21:41,687
 i gotta love
one man till i die 

365
00:21:41,756 --> 00:21:48,958
 can't help lovin'
that man of mine 

366
00:21:49,027 --> 00:21:52,427
 tell me he's lazy,
tell me he's slow 

367
00:21:52,496 --> 00:21:56,096
 tell me i'm crazy,
maybe i know 

368
00:21:56,164 --> 00:22:02,200
 can't help lovin'
that man of mine 

369
00:22:03,468 --> 00:22:10,272
 when he goes away,
that's a rainy day 

370
00:22:10,339 --> 00:22:15,041
 but when he comes back,
the day is fine 

371
00:22:15,109 --> 00:22:17,043
 the sun will shine 

372
00:22:17,109 --> 00:22:21,912
 he can come home
as late as can be 

373
00:22:21,980 --> 00:22:25,615
 home without him
ain't no home to me 

374
00:22:25,681 --> 00:22:33,253
 can't help lovin'
that man of mine 

375
00:22:33,320 --> 00:22:35,820
that's beautiful,
miss julie.

376
00:22:35,889 --> 00:22:38,922
Why, that's
my favorite song.

377
00:22:38,991 --> 00:22:41,391
[Queenie]
 my man is shiftless 

378
00:22:41,458 --> 00:22:43,726
 and good-for-nothin',
too 

379
00:22:43,793 --> 00:22:46,460
 he's my man
just the same 

380
00:22:46,529 --> 00:22:52,898
 he's never near me
when there's work to do 

381
00:22:52,965 --> 00:23:00,269
 he's never round you
when there's workin' to do 

382
00:23:00,336 --> 00:23:04,939
 the chimney's smokin',
the roof is leakin' in 

383
00:23:05,006 --> 00:23:07,773
 but he don't
seem to care 

384
00:23:07,842 --> 00:23:12,543
 he can be happy
with just a sip of gin 

385
00:23:12,610 --> 00:23:15,345
 why are you all
talking about gin? 

386
00:23:15,412 --> 00:23:20,581
 i even loves him
when his kisses
got gin 

387
00:23:22,017 --> 00:23:25,317
 fish gotta swim,
birds gotta fly 

388
00:23:25,386 --> 00:23:28,754
 i gotta love
one man till i die 

389
00:23:28,821 --> 00:23:32,556
 can't help lovin'
that man of mine 

390
00:23:32,623 --> 00:23:35,690
 or else
she ain't my gal 

391
00:23:35,759 --> 00:23:39,193
 tell me he's lazy,
tell me he's slow 

392
00:23:39,260 --> 00:23:42,628
 tell me i'm crazy,
maybe i know 

393
00:23:42,696 --> 00:23:46,831
 can't help lovin'
that man of mine 

394
00:23:46,898 --> 00:23:49,699
 she's just as crazy
'bout me 

395
00:23:49,767 --> 00:23:53,168
 when he goes away 

396
00:23:53,235 --> 00:23:56,336
 that's a rainy day 

397
00:23:56,405 --> 00:24:01,474
 and when he comes back,
that day is fine 

398
00:24:01,540 --> 00:24:03,241
look at that gal, sugar.

399
00:24:03,309 --> 00:24:06,910
 he can come home
as late as can be 

400
00:24:06,977 --> 00:24:10,345
 home without him
ain't no home to me 

401
00:24:10,414 --> 00:24:17,050
 can't help lovin'
that man of mine 

402
00:24:17,117 --> 00:24:18,684
magnolia!

403
00:24:35,228 --> 00:24:36,661
Say, dealer,
what was the turn?

404
00:24:36,729 --> 00:24:38,229
Ace won,
and king lost.

405
00:24:38,297 --> 00:24:40,131
Raise you
30 more.

406
00:24:40,197 --> 00:24:42,132
50 more
on the king.

407
00:24:45,167 --> 00:24:46,801
Who's that
sporting gambler
over there?

408
00:24:46,870 --> 00:24:48,268
Name's gaylord ravenal.

409
00:24:48,337 --> 00:24:49,736
Sounds familiar.

410
00:24:49,804 --> 00:24:52,004
Yeah. Got in
a little fuss here
about a year ago.

411
00:24:52,072 --> 00:24:54,272
Proved self-defense
and got out.

412
00:24:54,340 --> 00:24:57,441
The judge just told him
he'd better clear out of here
by nightfall.

413
00:24:57,509 --> 00:24:58,475
Waiter!

414
00:24:58,542 --> 00:24:59,942
We'll be late
for rehearsal.

415
00:25:00,010 --> 00:25:01,244
One more.

416
00:25:01,310 --> 00:25:03,245
Can i talk
to you, sir?

417
00:25:03,312 --> 00:25:05,646
Yeah, if you got
anything to say.

418
00:25:05,714 --> 00:25:07,247
See that?

419
00:25:07,314 --> 00:25:09,381
Why, that's
miss julie laverne,
ain't it?

420
00:25:09,450 --> 00:25:10,882
Yeah. That's what
she calls herself

421
00:25:10,950 --> 00:25:12,917
since she got married
to a white man.

422
00:25:12,985 --> 00:25:13,918
What?

423
00:25:13,986 --> 00:25:16,052
Frank, i want you
to hear this.

424
00:25:16,120 --> 00:25:17,219
You, too, elly.

425
00:25:17,287 --> 00:25:19,155
Sit down
and explain yourself.

426
00:25:19,222 --> 00:25:22,356
And you'll make sure
you know what you're
talking about.

427
00:25:24,559 --> 00:25:26,526
[Captain andy]
Let's go on with rehearsal.

428
00:25:26,593 --> 00:25:28,627
Good evening,
miss lucy.

429
00:25:28,694 --> 00:25:30,294
I was absorbed
in meditation

430
00:25:30,363 --> 00:25:32,630
and did not realize
night had fallen.

431
00:25:32,696 --> 00:25:34,964
The days are growing
shorter, hamilton,

432
00:25:35,031 --> 00:25:37,633
but they're long
when one is waiting.

433
00:25:37,700 --> 00:25:41,434
As i came
across the field,
i saw the cattle

434
00:25:41,502 --> 00:25:44,670
being driven home
by your faithful dog.

435
00:25:44,738 --> 00:25:46,172
You got that,
rubber face?

436
00:25:46,238 --> 00:25:47,639
Yep. I got
a cowbell.

437
00:25:47,705 --> 00:25:48,839
[Clang]

438
00:25:48,907 --> 00:25:50,774
It ain't a cowbell.

439
00:25:50,841 --> 00:25:53,708
It says here,
"cows moo
offstage."

440
00:25:53,777 --> 00:25:55,177
Have you got
a moo affect?

441
00:25:55,244 --> 00:25:57,344
Oh, i can
do that myself.

442
00:25:57,412 --> 00:25:59,213
Moo!

443
00:25:59,280 --> 00:26:01,413
Try that again
a little deeper.

444
00:26:01,481 --> 00:26:04,149
Moo!

445
00:26:04,216 --> 00:26:06,717
No, i guess
you better
ring the bell.

446
00:26:06,784 --> 00:26:08,018
May i make
a suggestion,
captain?

447
00:26:08,085 --> 00:26:09,019
Huh?

448
00:26:09,085 --> 00:26:10,652
I thought it would
be good if,

449
00:26:10,720 --> 00:26:12,354
while i was
talking over there,

450
00:26:12,421 --> 00:26:14,889
for frank
to pass the window
and peek through,

451
00:26:14,956 --> 00:26:16,156
like this.

452
00:26:17,591 --> 00:26:19,558
You can't. Room's
on the second floor.

453
00:26:19,626 --> 00:26:21,026
Frank couldn't
look through the window

454
00:26:21,093 --> 00:26:22,493
if it was on
the second floor.

455
00:26:22,561 --> 00:26:24,160
It wouldn't be
any good anyway.

456
00:26:24,229 --> 00:26:25,595
Julie let me
study her part.

457
00:26:25,663 --> 00:26:27,262
I know every line
and all the business.

458
00:26:27,331 --> 00:26:29,264
If you forget anything,
ask me.

459
00:26:29,332 --> 00:26:30,832
You stick to the piano,
young lady.

460
00:26:30,899 --> 00:26:33,900
No playacting for you.

461
00:26:33,967 --> 00:26:36,468
[Captain andy]
All right, now try it.

462
00:26:36,536 --> 00:26:38,469
Oh, there you are!
You're late.

463
00:26:38,537 --> 00:26:41,738
I'll explain later.
Steve, i got something
to tell you.

464
00:26:41,805 --> 00:26:42,806
Where's frank?

465
00:26:42,873 --> 00:26:44,240
He's coming.

466
00:26:44,308 --> 00:26:45,942
<i>Is thall you're
going to say to them?</i>

467
00:26:46,008 --> 00:26:47,742
She said she'd
explain later,
didn't she?

468
00:26:47,809 --> 00:26:49,510
Humph!
Fine disciplining
this troupe's got.

469
00:26:49,578 --> 00:26:51,011
Humph!

470
00:26:51,078 --> 00:26:52,579
He'll be here
any second.

471
00:26:52,645 --> 00:26:54,313
[Captain andy]
As we're waiting
for frank,

472
00:26:54,380 --> 00:26:56,013
we'll cut
right down
to his entrance.

473
00:26:56,082 --> 00:26:57,981
All right,
steve.

474
00:26:58,050 --> 00:27:01,017
Oh. All right.

475
00:27:02,285 --> 00:27:05,086
Miss lucy, although
i wear the clothes...

476
00:27:05,154 --> 00:27:06,354
garb.

477
00:27:06,421 --> 00:27:08,821
Garb of a parson,
beneath these
somber vestments,

478
00:27:08,890 --> 00:27:11,557
there is the heart
of a man that ats
for you alone.

479
00:27:11,624 --> 00:27:13,358
Hamilton.

480
00:27:15,560 --> 00:27:17,293
[Elly]
They'll be here
any second.

481
00:27:17,361 --> 00:27:18,961
Embrace over.
Then what?

482
00:27:19,029 --> 00:27:21,196
Then... then
i say, uh...

483
00:27:21,263 --> 00:27:22,830
prompt her,
noli.

484
00:27:22,898 --> 00:27:24,631
[Magnolia]
Hamilton,
my own, my...

485
00:27:24,700 --> 00:27:25,764
papa, look
at julie!

486
00:27:25,833 --> 00:27:26,766
What's
the matter?

487
00:27:26,833 --> 00:27:27,834
Julie's
sick.

488
00:27:27,901 --> 00:27:29,034
What's
the matter, julie?

489
00:27:29,102 --> 00:27:31,002
Land's sakes!

490
00:27:36,707 --> 00:27:39,341
Sure you won't be
feeling better
by tonight?

491
00:27:39,407 --> 00:27:43,743
No, no. Let me alone.
Can't you leave me alone?

492
00:27:43,811 --> 00:27:46,845
[Captain andy]
Hello, windy.
What are you doing here?

493
00:27:46,913 --> 00:27:48,946
Just come over
to warn you.

494
00:27:49,014 --> 00:27:51,915
Seen pete
coming along the levee
with the sheriff.

495
00:27:51,983 --> 00:27:53,249
Be along any minute.

496
00:27:53,317 --> 00:27:55,683
Well, let him
come on board.
Our license is paid.

497
00:27:55,752 --> 00:27:58,318
Seems that skunk pete's
up to something.

498
00:27:58,387 --> 00:27:59,819
Seen him yank
a picture of julie

499
00:27:59,887 --> 00:28:01,654
out of a frame
on the levee.

500
00:28:01,722 --> 00:28:02,755
I seen him.

501
00:28:02,822 --> 00:28:04,389
What are we
going to do?

502
00:28:04,457 --> 00:28:07,391
Stay right here.
You know what
i told you.

503
00:28:07,459 --> 00:28:09,626
Steve!
What are you doing
with that knife?

504
00:28:09,693 --> 00:28:11,760
I'm not going to
hurt her, you fool.

505
00:28:11,828 --> 00:28:14,262
Leave me be.
I know what i'm doing.

506
00:28:14,330 --> 00:28:16,463
It won't
hurt much, darling.

507
00:28:17,331 --> 00:28:18,264
Aah!

508
00:28:18,332 --> 00:28:20,199
Steve!

509
00:28:47,249 --> 00:28:49,050
Hello,
windy.

510
00:28:49,118 --> 00:28:50,184
Captain
hawks,

511
00:28:50,251 --> 00:28:51,518
do you
acknowledge

512
00:28:51,586 --> 00:28:53,586
to be owner of
the show boat?

513
00:28:53,654 --> 00:28:55,720
Why, of course i do.

514
00:28:55,788 --> 00:28:56,955
What do you want?

515
00:28:57,023 --> 00:28:58,422
I have
an unpleasant duty.

516
00:28:58,490 --> 00:29:01,457
I understand that you
have a miscegenation
case on board.

517
00:29:01,525 --> 00:29:02,457
What's that?

518
00:29:02,526 --> 00:29:03,692
[Captain andy]
How's that?

519
00:29:03,760 --> 00:29:05,926
A case of a negro woman
married to a white man...

520
00:29:05,994 --> 00:29:07,927
a criminal offense
in this state.

521
00:29:07,995 --> 00:29:10,597
No. No such thing
on board this boat.

522
00:29:10,664 --> 00:29:13,798
The name
of the white man
is steve baker.

523
00:29:15,134 --> 00:29:17,100
The name
of the negress...

524
00:29:17,168 --> 00:29:19,869
the name
of the negress
is julie dosher.

525
00:29:19,936 --> 00:29:21,370
Which one's
them?

526
00:29:21,437 --> 00:29:25,339
I am steve baker.
This is my wife.

527
00:29:27,241 --> 00:29:29,508
Julie dosher,
my information says

528
00:29:29,575 --> 00:29:31,510
you were born
in mississippi.

529
00:29:31,576 --> 00:29:34,077
Your pop was white,
your mammy black.

530
00:29:34,146 --> 00:29:35,545
Is that right?

531
00:29:35,613 --> 00:29:37,212
Yes, that's right.

532
00:29:37,281 --> 00:29:39,248
You two better
get your things

533
00:29:39,315 --> 00:29:40,815
and come along
with me.

534
00:29:40,882 --> 00:29:43,483
You wouldn't
call a man a white man

535
00:29:43,550 --> 00:29:45,284
that had negro blood
in him, would you?

536
00:29:45,352 --> 00:29:47,285
No, i wouldn't,
not in mississippi.

537
00:29:47,353 --> 00:29:48,920
One drop
of negro blood

538
00:29:48,987 --> 00:29:50,921
makes you a negro
in these parts.

539
00:29:50,989 --> 00:29:54,756
Well, i got more than a drop
of negro blood in me,

540
00:29:54,825 --> 00:29:56,457
and that's a fact.

541
00:29:57,959 --> 00:29:59,493
Are you ready
to swear that

542
00:29:59,561 --> 00:30:00,960
in a court of law?

543
00:30:01,028 --> 00:30:02,728
I'll swear to it
anyplace.

544
00:30:02,797 --> 00:30:04,596
I'll do more
than that.

545
00:30:04,663 --> 00:30:06,998
Look at all
these folks here.

546
00:30:07,066 --> 00:30:08,498
Every one of them
can swear

547
00:30:08,567 --> 00:30:10,766
that i got negro blood
in me this minute.

548
00:30:10,834 --> 00:30:13,069
That's how white i am.

549
00:30:14,236 --> 00:30:17,004
Well, i've seen
fairer men than you

550
00:30:17,072 --> 00:30:18,472
that were negroes.

551
00:30:18,539 --> 00:30:20,605
Still,
you better tell that
to the judge.

552
00:30:20,674 --> 00:30:24,508
Ahem! Ike vallon,
you've known me

553
00:30:24,576 --> 00:30:26,509
the better part
of 25 years.

554
00:30:26,577 --> 00:30:29,478
I was keelboating
when you was running barefoot

555
00:30:29,546 --> 00:30:31,013
around the landing.

556
00:30:31,080 --> 00:30:34,848
Now, i'm telling you...
me, windy mcclain...

557
00:30:34,916 --> 00:30:37,350
that white man's
got negro blood in him.

558
00:30:37,417 --> 00:30:38,784
But this fellow
told me...

559
00:30:38,851 --> 00:30:41,018
i don't care
what anybody told you.

560
00:30:41,087 --> 00:30:43,520
I'm taking my oath
on what i just said.

561
00:30:43,588 --> 00:30:45,788
Steve's got
negro blood in him.

562
00:30:47,091 --> 00:30:49,890
Do you all stand by
what windy just said?

563
00:30:49,958 --> 00:30:51,291
Of course we do.

564
00:30:53,027 --> 00:30:55,461
You look like
a respectable woman.

565
00:30:55,529 --> 00:30:56,928
I am.

566
00:30:56,996 --> 00:30:59,963
Windy wouldn't tell a lie
to save his own life.

567
00:31:00,032 --> 00:31:01,231
You know that, sheriff.

568
00:31:01,299 --> 00:31:02,498
Yes, i know.

569
00:31:02,567 --> 00:31:05,233
I reckon i'll have to take
windy's word for it,

570
00:31:05,301 --> 00:31:07,434
but from now on,
it's your business and not mine.

571
00:31:07,503 --> 00:31:08,535
I warn you...

572
00:31:08,603 --> 00:31:10,470
if these folks around here
ever got wind

573
00:31:10,537 --> 00:31:12,738
that you've got negroes
acting with whites,

574
00:31:12,806 --> 00:31:14,740
they'll ride you
out of town

575
00:31:14,806 --> 00:31:17,441
on something that won't
set so easy as a boat.

576
00:31:17,509 --> 00:31:19,142
Get away from that window!

577
00:31:19,210 --> 00:31:21,843
Go on about your business.
Break it up!

578
00:31:26,547 --> 00:31:28,481
Now you go!
Both of you!

579
00:31:28,548 --> 00:31:30,982
You needn't look at us
like that.

580
00:31:31,051 --> 00:31:32,984
We're not going to
hurt you.

581
00:31:33,051 --> 00:31:36,219
We're going right away.
Come on, honey.

582
00:31:39,555 --> 00:31:41,489
Julie! Julie!

583
00:31:41,557 --> 00:31:42,990
Nola, where are
you going?

584
00:31:43,058 --> 00:31:44,491
I'm going to julie!

585
00:31:44,559 --> 00:31:45,991
Come back here
this instant.

586
00:31:46,060 --> 00:31:47,493
No daughter of mine
will talk to that...

587
00:31:47,560 --> 00:31:49,027
let me go, mother!

588
00:31:54,031 --> 00:31:57,866
I think my show boat's
made a darn fine gal
out of my daughter.

589
00:31:57,933 --> 00:32:00,534
But where
do we go from here?
Hanged if i know.

590
00:32:00,602 --> 00:32:03,269
We can't give
no more shows
without a leading man.

591
00:32:03,337 --> 00:32:05,036
Or a leading lady.

592
00:32:05,105 --> 00:32:06,971
I can play
the lead, can't i?

593
00:32:07,039 --> 00:32:08,472
No. You're
a comedienne.

594
00:32:08,540 --> 00:32:11,241
I was thinking
maybe we'd let
noli jump in.

595
00:32:11,308 --> 00:32:12,741
She knows
all the parts.

596
00:32:12,809 --> 00:32:13,942
Over my dead body.

597
00:32:14,009 --> 00:32:15,977
There never was
an actress in my family,

598
00:32:16,044 --> 00:32:17,311
and there ain't
going to be.

599
00:32:17,378 --> 00:32:21,080
Now if only there
was anybody to play
steve's part.

600
00:32:21,149 --> 00:32:22,748
What about frank?

601
00:32:22,815 --> 00:32:24,082
[Parthy]
Hmm!

602
00:32:24,150 --> 00:32:25,750
Fine leading man
he'd make

603
00:32:25,817 --> 00:32:27,283
with that face
and those flat feet.

604
00:32:27,352 --> 00:32:29,285
I never asked
to play leads, did i?

605
00:32:29,352 --> 00:32:31,920
I never set up
to be a beauty.

606
00:32:31,988 --> 00:32:33,421
Just a minute,
captain!

607
00:32:33,489 --> 00:32:35,289
Mercy! Something
must be on fire,

608
00:32:35,356 --> 00:32:36,523
the way
queenie's running.

609
00:32:36,590 --> 00:32:37,790
Now what's
the trouble,
queenie?

610
00:32:37,858 --> 00:32:39,992
There's a powerful
fine-looking fellow out here.

611
00:32:40,059 --> 00:32:42,026
Wants to know if you-all
could accommodate him

612
00:32:42,094 --> 00:32:44,127
by taking him down the river
far as the next town.

613
00:32:44,195 --> 00:32:45,228
We don't carry
no passengers...

614
00:32:45,296 --> 00:32:46,695
fine-looking,
did you say?

615
00:32:46,764 --> 00:32:47,997
Is he an actor?

616
00:32:48,063 --> 00:32:51,932
Might be, but he seems more
like the kind of a gentleman

617
00:32:52,000 --> 00:32:53,933
it's a pleasure to wait on.

618
00:32:54,002 --> 00:32:55,601
There he is.

619
00:32:55,668 --> 00:32:56,935
I thought, sir,
if i could have

620
00:32:57,003 --> 00:32:58,970
a bed on your boat
tonight,

621
00:32:59,037 --> 00:33:01,538
i could pay my way
as far as fort adams.

622
00:33:01,606 --> 00:33:02,806
You ain't
an actor,
are you?

623
00:33:02,873 --> 00:33:04,973
An actor, sir?
No, captain.

624
00:33:05,041 --> 00:33:08,475
I'm a ravenal.
Gaylord ravenal is my name,

625
00:33:08,544 --> 00:33:10,644
of the tennessee ravenals.

626
00:33:10,711 --> 00:33:13,112
I knew it. He looked
like an aristocrat to me.

627
00:33:13,180 --> 00:33:16,214
Aristocrat? Huh!
Looks more like
a river gambler.

628
00:33:16,282 --> 00:33:18,215
Well, i'm going to
take a chance.

629
00:33:18,283 --> 00:33:19,750
Look here, sir.

630
00:33:19,817 --> 00:33:22,484
I'm looking for a juvenile
leading man.

631
00:33:22,552 --> 00:33:25,186
Am i to understand
you're offering me
the position, sir?

632
00:33:25,253 --> 00:33:28,021
Andy hawks will wind up
in a lunatic asylum yet.

633
00:33:28,088 --> 00:33:30,756
If you can
play the parts
to my satisfaction,

634
00:33:30,825 --> 00:33:32,758
i'll give you
$15 a week

635
00:33:32,825 --> 00:33:34,492
and a chance
to see the world.

636
00:33:34,559 --> 00:33:35,793
I've seen it.

637
00:33:35,860 --> 00:33:37,993
We don't usually pick up actors
off the wharves,

638
00:33:38,061 --> 00:33:39,829
but we can't be choosy
just now.

639
00:33:39,896 --> 00:33:43,498
Madam, your courtesy
is only exceeded
by your charm.

640
00:33:43,565 --> 00:33:45,199
Ha ha ha!

641
00:33:45,265 --> 00:33:46,499
Mother! Father!

642
00:33:46,567 --> 00:33:48,500
Don't let them go,
please, papa!

643
00:33:48,568 --> 00:33:50,935
Don't send julie and steve
away like this.

644
00:33:51,003 --> 00:33:52,937
Nobody will know about them
in the next town.

645
00:33:53,003 --> 00:33:54,537
Julie's my friend.

646
00:33:54,605 --> 00:33:56,206
That's a nice thing
to say.

647
00:33:56,272 --> 00:33:58,206
Well, she is! She is!

648
00:33:58,274 --> 00:33:59,941
She's been my friend ever since
she's been on this boat,

649
00:34:00,008 --> 00:34:01,708
and if you're going to
send her away

650
00:34:01,776 --> 00:34:03,443
for something she can't help,
i'll go, too!

651
00:34:03,510 --> 00:34:04,443
Nola!

652
00:34:04,511 --> 00:34:05,944
Nola, don't talk nonsense.

653
00:34:06,012 --> 00:34:07,445
You've got to stay here
with your mother,

654
00:34:07,513 --> 00:34:08,946
no matter what.

655
00:34:09,014 --> 00:34:10,948
And another thing...
i'm depending on you

656
00:34:11,014 --> 00:34:13,382
to play the leads
till we can get somebody.

657
00:34:13,450 --> 00:34:15,183
See, nola?
What a chance for you.

658
00:34:15,251 --> 00:34:16,751
I just know
you can act.

659
00:34:16,818 --> 00:34:18,519
And if this young man
wants to play the leads

660
00:34:18,587 --> 00:34:19,819
and play opposite you,

661
00:34:19,887 --> 00:34:22,654
i can get you both ready
by tomorrow night.

662
00:34:22,722 --> 00:34:24,655
Are you a quick study?

663
00:34:24,724 --> 00:34:25,923
Lightning.

664
00:34:25,991 --> 00:34:27,492
[Steve]
Ready, julie?

665
00:34:27,558 --> 00:34:29,492
I didn't have time
to get everything
together, captain.

666
00:34:29,560 --> 00:34:30,960
If you'll bundle up
our trash

667
00:34:31,027 --> 00:34:33,461
and leave it
at the post office
in new orleans,

668
00:34:33,529 --> 00:34:34,963
we'll pick it up.

669
00:34:35,029 --> 00:34:36,963
Do you need
any money, steve?

670
00:34:37,031 --> 00:34:39,465
No. I guess we'll
make out all right.

671
00:34:39,533 --> 00:34:40,966
Thanks. Good-bye.

672
00:34:41,033 --> 00:34:42,467
Good-bye, steve.

673
00:34:42,534 --> 00:34:44,368
Forget it.

674
00:34:44,436 --> 00:34:45,969
Good-bye, nola.

675
00:34:47,137 --> 00:34:52,607
I'll write to you,
and you write to me,

676
00:35:02,013 --> 00:35:03,947
julie! Julie!

677
00:35:04,014 --> 00:35:06,147
Don't look back,
darling.

678
00:35:09,951 --> 00:35:12,418
Bye, master steve.

679
00:35:12,486 --> 00:35:15,187
Good-bye, miss julie.

680
00:35:15,255 --> 00:35:16,687
Bye, joe.

681
00:35:16,756 --> 00:35:18,154
Good-bye, joe.

682
00:35:21,025 --> 00:35:22,292
Good-bye.

683
00:35:42,372 --> 00:35:43,938
We ain't got much time.

684
00:35:44,005 --> 00:35:46,439
Mr. Ravenal, i want to see
how you handle dialogue.

685
00:35:46,507 --> 00:35:48,474
Will you read
that speech right there?

686
00:35:48,542 --> 00:35:50,408
Now, the idea
of this character is

687
00:35:50,476 --> 00:35:51,910
you're in love with her.

688
00:35:51,976 --> 00:35:53,911
Now, come on.
Just a sample.

689
00:35:53,978 --> 00:35:55,379
What do i do,
papa?

690
00:35:55,445 --> 00:35:56,913
Oh, you just smile.
That'll get them.

691
00:35:56,980 --> 00:35:58,313
Miss lucy,
will you be mine?

692
00:35:58,381 --> 00:36:00,115
Hmm!

693
00:36:00,181 --> 00:36:01,882
Ha ha ha! Gosh, no.
Nothing like it.

694
00:36:01,950 --> 00:36:04,417
More feeling.
More like you meant it.

695
00:36:04,485 --> 00:36:06,885
You love her. Gosh almighty,
man, you love her!

696
00:36:06,953 --> 00:36:08,619
Go on and tell her.

697
00:36:08,688 --> 00:36:10,388
Oh, i understand.

698
00:36:11,989 --> 00:36:14,823
Miss lucy,
will you be mine?

699
00:36:19,794 --> 00:36:22,662
Ha ha ha!

700
00:36:34,504 --> 00:36:35,636
[Applause]

701
00:36:57,451 --> 00:36:58,650
Did you like it,
mrs. Ewing?

702
00:36:58,718 --> 00:37:00,151
I've seen it
four times.

703
00:37:00,219 --> 00:37:01,419
I liked it
better than ever.

704
00:37:01,486 --> 00:37:03,420
Don't you think
the leading man
is gorgeous?

705
00:37:03,488 --> 00:37:05,422
Yes. He took his part
off quite good.

706
00:37:05,488 --> 00:37:07,689
I liked the leading lady
the best, though.

707
00:37:07,757 --> 00:37:09,891
Did you understand the moral
of the play, my dear?

708
00:37:09,959 --> 00:37:12,426
Oh, sure, mom.
Did you see
how he kissed her?

709
00:37:12,493 --> 00:37:15,393
Yes. I hardly thought
that was in the best of taste.

710
00:37:15,462 --> 00:37:17,429
Well, that's
show business.

711
00:37:17,496 --> 00:37:18,896
What's show business?

712
00:37:18,964 --> 00:37:22,098
I've been trouping
up and down this river
for 12 years.

713
00:37:22,166 --> 00:37:23,599
Nobody ever heard of me.

714
00:37:23,667 --> 00:37:25,934
This ravenal has been
acting exactly three weeks.

715
00:37:26,001 --> 00:37:27,935
They make a star
out of him.

716
00:37:28,003 --> 00:37:29,936
I feel the same way,
frank.

717
00:37:30,004 --> 00:37:31,371
Look at magnolia.

718
00:37:31,438 --> 00:37:33,939
Her picture with ravenal
is on all the posters.

719
00:37:34,006 --> 00:37:35,706
We're not in town
an hour

720
00:37:35,774 --> 00:37:37,941
before captain andy
has their faces
on every ashcan.

721
00:37:38,009 --> 00:37:39,943
You want to know the secret
of their quick success?

722
00:37:40,010 --> 00:37:41,911
They're falling in love
with each other.

723
00:37:41,978 --> 00:37:43,345
What's that got
to do with it?

724
00:37:43,412 --> 00:37:45,946
Well, they make love
on the stage,
and it rings true.

725
00:37:46,014 --> 00:37:47,280
That's why they're a hit.

726
00:37:47,348 --> 00:37:49,448
Well, i've been
playing opposite you
for five years,

727
00:37:49,516 --> 00:37:50,849
and i love you.

728
00:37:50,917 --> 00:37:53,451
Yeah, but maybe
i don't love you.

729
00:37:53,518 --> 00:37:55,885
So you're responsible
for our failure!

730
00:37:55,953 --> 00:37:58,387
We'll never be stars
on this show boat.

731
00:37:58,455 --> 00:38:01,389
You talk
as if you expected
to live on this barge

732
00:38:01,457 --> 00:38:02,890
the rest
of your life.

733
00:38:02,957 --> 00:38:04,890
Ain't you got
no ambition?

734
00:38:04,959 --> 00:38:07,892
Sure,
i got ambition.
I want to marry you.

735
00:38:07,961 --> 00:38:10,894
You know our rules,
mr. Schultz.

736
00:38:10,962 --> 00:38:12,895
No gentleman
allowed in no lady's
dressing room.

737
00:38:12,963 --> 00:38:14,397
He was only waiting
while l...

738
00:38:14,464 --> 00:38:15,897
you know the rules,
too, miss shipley.

739
00:38:15,965 --> 00:38:17,633
Out, mr. Schultz!

740
00:38:18,867 --> 00:38:19,867
Hello, frank.

741
00:38:19,935 --> 00:38:21,401
Hello, ravenal.

742
00:38:21,469 --> 00:38:22,636
Huh!

743
00:38:32,442 --> 00:38:33,609
Uh...

744
00:38:37,445 --> 00:38:39,380
the show, uh...

745
00:38:39,446 --> 00:38:41,346
uh...

746
00:38:41,415 --> 00:38:43,415
the show seemed
to go well tonight.

747
00:38:43,483 --> 00:38:44,782
Yes. Didn't it?

748
00:38:44,850 --> 00:38:47,851
Yes, it did.

749
00:38:49,486 --> 00:38:51,419
Hasn't the weather
been fine?

750
00:38:51,488 --> 00:38:54,421
Yes, hasn't
the weather been fine?

751
00:38:56,391 --> 00:38:57,990
Well, good night.

752
00:38:58,058 --> 00:39:00,259
Good night.

753
00:39:55,426 --> 00:39:58,161
It seems to me i've seen
that stocking someplace.

754
00:39:58,228 --> 00:40:01,229
Where could it have been?

755
00:40:01,297 --> 00:40:03,630
Don't you belong
to a miss magnolia hawks?

756
00:40:04,999 --> 00:40:07,366
I thought so.

757
00:40:07,434 --> 00:40:08,901
Next time you see he

758
00:40:08,968 --> 00:40:11,436
will you give her
a message for me?

759
00:40:11,503 --> 00:40:13,904
I can talk to you
better than i can to her.

760
00:40:13,971 --> 00:40:17,907
I always get flustered
when i try to say
anything to her.

761
00:40:17,973 --> 00:40:19,673
Tell her...

762
00:40:21,042 --> 00:40:24,911
tell her you saw
the young man
who lives upstairs,

763
00:40:24,977 --> 00:40:27,446
and... well,
that's just the point.

764
00:40:27,512 --> 00:40:30,180
I have the room
above her.

765
00:40:30,248 --> 00:40:34,450
 she doesn't know
i love her 

766
00:40:34,517 --> 00:40:39,086
 how could she
know i love her? 

767
00:40:39,153 --> 00:40:43,555
 sitting in her room
below 

768
00:40:43,623 --> 00:40:46,758
 sitting in her room
below 

769
00:40:46,825 --> 00:40:54,262
 how could she dream
how far a dream could go? 

770
00:40:54,329 --> 00:40:56,362
 sometimes we meet 

771
00:40:56,431 --> 00:41:01,533
 she smiles, and, oh,
her smile's divine 

772
00:41:01,600 --> 00:41:06,035
 it's such a treat
to hear her say 

773
00:41:06,104 --> 00:41:11,839
 "hasn't the weather
been fine?" 

774
00:41:11,907 --> 00:41:15,575
 i blush
and stammer badly 

775
00:41:15,642 --> 00:41:19,878
 my heart
is beating madly 

776
00:41:19,945 --> 00:41:26,682
 then she goes
into her room 

777
00:41:26,750 --> 00:41:35,487
 and i go sadly
up to mine 

778
00:41:46,228 --> 00:41:50,063
 a lover
more impetuous than i 

779
00:41:50,130 --> 00:41:54,032
 would say his say
or know the reason why 

780
00:41:54,099 --> 00:41:57,267
 but when i get
my chance 

781
00:41:57,335 --> 00:42:05,272
 i let my chance go by 

782
00:42:05,340 --> 00:42:09,375
 i have the room
above her 

783
00:42:09,442 --> 00:42:13,076
 she doesn't know

Good evening,

down the curtain

before the act was over,
but the fact is,

1035
00:53:48,505 --> 00:53:50,838
our heavy man, mr. Schultz,
was suddenly took sick.

1036
00:53:50,906 --> 00:53:53,307
He gets a spell like that
every once in a while.

Go on. Take it up!

1041
00:53:59,477 --> 00:54:01,412
Now, folks,
just before mr. Schultz

1042
00:54:01,479 --> 00:54:03,413
was tooken
with that attack,

1043
00:54:03,480 --> 00:54:06,148
he and the parson
were on the verge

1044
00:54:06,216 --> 00:54:08,916
of going into one
of the most sensational

1045

to the death

ever seen on any stage.

1047
00:54:12,852 --> 00:54:16,887
Now, when egbert sees the parson
coming in through this door,

1048
00:54:16,956 --> 00:54:18,922
he should have said...

1049
00:54:18,990 --> 00:54:20,924
"ha ha ha!

1050
00:54:20,991 --> 00:54:24,426
I'm glad you come
when you did."

1051
00:54:24,493 --> 00:54:26,527
And with that,

1052
00:54:26,595 --> 00:54:29,429
he hauls off
and hits the parson.

1053
00:54:29,496 --> 00:54:32,431
But the parson knows
a thing or two,

1054
00:54:32,498 --> 00:54:36,433
and he gives egbert
something he ain't looking for.

1055
00:54:36,501 --> 00:54:38,834
"Take that, you cur!"

1056
00:54:38,903 --> 00:54:40,569
And down goes egbert.

1057
00:54:45,607 --> 00:54:48,441
Egbert, realizing that he ain't
going to win the fight

1058
00:54:48,507 --> 00:54:50,375
by fair means,
resorts to foul.

1059
00:54:50,443 --> 00:54:52,376
He grabs the parson
round the waist

1060
00:54:52,444 --> 00:54:54,410
and backheels him.

1061
00:54:54,479 --> 00:54:57,412
"Let go of me, i say.
Let go of me!"

1062
00:54:57,481 --> 00:55:01,415
Ow. In the meantime,
lucy is over here

1063
00:55:01,483 --> 00:55:03,416
praying for her beloved.

1064
00:55:03,484 --> 00:55:05,918
Now comes the big
dramatic moment.

1065
00:55:05,986 --> 00:55:08,953
Egbert, the dirty skunk,
reaches in his pocket,

1066
00:55:09,021 --> 00:55:12,456
pulls out a monkey wrench
with which he hits the parson.

1067
00:55:12,522 --> 00:55:14,457
"Uh!" the parson groans...

1068
00:55:14,524 --> 00:55:19,425
"wooo!"...
reels and falls.

1069
00:55:19,494 --> 00:55:22,227
Egbert is about to beat
the parson's brains out

1070
00:55:22,296 --> 00:55:23,662
when lucy says,

1071
00:55:23,730 --> 00:55:28,431
"do with me what you will
but spare my hamilton!"

1072
00:55:28,499 --> 00:55:31,500
Now, as though providence
had heard her prayer,

1073
00:55:31,568 --> 00:55:32,967
the door swings open,

1074
00:55:33,036 --> 00:55:35,469

in walks emmy,

of lucy,

1076

ready to right the wrong
she'd done poor lucy.

form of the parson

and the weeping figure
of her heartbroken sister

to spare the parson,

1082

1083
00:55:54,682 --> 00:55:56,416
where's
the water pitcher?...

1084
00:55:56,483 --> 00:55:59,884
the water pitcher,
sneaks up on egbert and says,

1085
00:55:59,952 --> 00:56:03,220
"the wages of sin
is death!"

1086

[Audience screams]

And she kills the dirty rascal
deader than a doornail.

1088

would have seen

for mr. Schultz

when he was.

No, you won't

You and me

to get a doctor
tonight.

I'll get a doctor.

Where's gay?
Where's my gay?

1322
01:08:44,222 --> 01:08:46,454
Suppose
he's drowned?

1323
01:08:46,523 --> 01:08:48,289
He ain't drowned.

1324
01:08:50,024 --> 01:08:51,325
Gay and frank

1325

to the boat.

1326

Most likely,
they're staying
at a hotel

1327
01:08:55,062 --> 01:08:56,594
till the morning.

1328
01:08:56,662 --> 01:08:58,629
And his baby
being born.

1329
01:08:58,697 --> 01:09:00,997
Gay didn't know it.

1330
01:09:01,065 --> 01:09:03,298
We didn't
think that...

1331
01:09:03,366 --> 01:09:05,467
it's much sooner.

1332
01:09:05,534 --> 01:09:07,234
How could gay
know it?

1333
01:09:07,302 --> 01:09:10,270
Of course he couldn't.
Now, now, don't get
excited, deary.

Oh, lie back.

You're making
a nuisance

what to call her.

Kim? That ain't
no name.

1367
01:10:43,662 --> 01:10:45,061
I made it up.

01:11:08,577 --> 01:11:09,876
Good morning,
madam.

1375
01:11:09,945 --> 01:11:11,444
I knew
this was coming.

1376
01:11:11,512 --> 01:11:13,712
I knew from the first minute
i set eyes on you

1377
01:11:13,780 --> 01:11:15,380
that you was the kind
to bring trouble

1378

to them that
loved you.

1379
01:11:16,914 --> 01:11:19,616
I knew you'd go carousing
the first chance you got

1380
01:11:19,683 --> 01:11:21,283
and break
my girl's heart,

1381
01:11:21,351 --> 01:11:22,817
and i wish
the lord had kept you

1382
01:11:22,886 --> 01:11:24,319
from ever setting foot
on this boat.

1383
01:11:24,386 --> 01:11:26,653
Indeed? Then you'll
be glad to know

01:11:26,721 --> 01:11:28,154
that i'm leaving it
forever,

my wife with me.

Humph. When?

1387
01:11:31,791 --> 01:11:33,524
The minute the river
goes down enough

1388
01:11:33,592 --> 01:11:35,559
for us to take
our things ashore.

1389
01:11:35,626 --> 01:11:37,961
You will not go today,
gaylord ravenal.

1390
01:11:38,027 --> 01:11:40,262
Why not?
What have you to say
about it, anyway?

1391
01:11:40,329 --> 01:11:41,896
She'll not
leave her home

1392
01:11:41,964 --> 01:11:44,030
till you've money
to care for her proper,

01:11:44,098 --> 01:11:46,699
and you know how long
before that will be.

01:11:46,767 --> 01:11:48,199
And suppose
i was to tell you

1395
01:11:48,268 --> 01:11:50,468
that i had money,
and plenty of it?

1396
01:11:50,536 --> 01:11:52,803

you can't take a girl

I thought he knew that.

1573
01:20:05,610 --> 01:20:07,278
Look, deary,
you and kim

1574
01:20:07,345 --> 01:20:09,946
can have a good home
on the show boat.

1575
01:20:10,014 --> 01:20:11,414
Good home?

1576
01:20:11,482 --> 01:20:13,817
Living on charity
and having my mother tell me

1577
01:20:13,884 --> 01:20:16,318
she always knew
it would be like this,

1578
01:20:16,386 --> 01:20:18,187
the whole show boat troupe

1579
01:20:18,254 --> 01:20:20,455
whispering about me
in their dressing rooms...

1580
01:20:20,523 --> 01:20:23,692
no. I'll do anything
but that.

1581
01:20:23,760 --> 01:20:25,193
Won't it cost you
something

1582
01:20:25,260 --> 01:20:26,661
to keep the kid
at the convent?

1583
01:20:26,728 --> 01:20:30,031
This money will help me
for a month or so.

1584
01:20:30,098 --> 01:20:31,965
Meanwhile,
i'll look for work.

1585
01:20:32,033 --> 01:20:34,000
Well, don't forget
what i said

1586
01:20:34,068 --> 01:20:36,236
about the trocadero.

1587
01:20:36,304 --> 01:20:37,971
The troca...

1588
01:20:38,039 --> 01:20:42,408
oh, yes. I might
try that, frank.

1589
01:20:42,475 --> 01:20:44,310
I'll think it over.

1590
01:20:44,377 --> 01:20:46,979
You'd like us to go,
wouldn't you, dear?

1591
01:20:47,047 --> 01:20:49,113
Sure. Sure, noli.

1592
01:20:49,181 --> 01:20:51,649
Elly and i 23.
We skiddoo.

1593
01:20:52,985 --> 01:20:56,386
You can get us
over at forbes hotel
if you want us.

1594
01:20:56,454 --> 01:20:58,522
All right, dear.

1595
01:21:12,635 --> 01:21:13,602
Oh!

1596
01:21:13,669 --> 01:21:15,103
[Crying]

1597
01:21:19,608 --> 01:21:21,475
[Singing]

1598
01:21:31,652 --> 01:21:33,219
Your daughter's
class

1599
01:21:33,287 --> 01:21:35,554
will be coming
through next.

1600
01:21:39,025 --> 01:21:40,359
Kim.

1601
01:21:40,426 --> 01:21:42,193
Daddy!

1602
01:21:51,102 --> 01:21:53,036
Where's mom?

1603
01:21:56,908 --> 01:21:59,408
Mother couldn't
come today, dear.

1604
01:21:59,476 --> 01:22:01,110
Now listen,
kim, dear.

1605
01:22:01,177 --> 01:22:02,511
Daddy's in
a great hurry.

1606
01:22:02,579 --> 01:22:04,013
He must
catch a train.

1607
01:22:04,080 --> 01:22:05,080
Where are you going?

1608
01:22:05,148 --> 01:22:08,283
Away for a little while
on business.

1609
01:22:08,350 --> 01:22:11,286
I just had a few minutes
to rush in and see you.

1610
01:22:11,353 --> 01:22:12,754
Can i go with you?

1611
01:22:12,821 --> 01:22:14,288
No, darling...

1612
01:22:15,857 --> 01:22:18,058
not this trip.

1613
01:22:18,126 --> 01:22:19,993
And when i'm gone,

1614
01:22:20,061 --> 01:22:23,162
i want you
to think of me
once in a while.

1615
01:22:23,230 --> 01:22:24,630
Will you?

1616
01:22:24,698 --> 01:22:26,899
Yes. I think of you
all the time,

1617
01:22:26,967 --> 01:22:28,401
and when i miss you,

1618
01:22:28,468 --> 01:22:29,868
i always do
what you told me.

1619
01:22:29,936 --> 01:22:31,136
What was that?

1620
01:22:31,203 --> 01:22:34,439
Don't you remember?
Make believe.

1621
01:22:34,507 --> 01:22:36,941
Oh, yes.
That's right.

1622
01:22:37,008 --> 01:22:38,943
I gave you a system

1623
01:22:39,010 --> 01:22:40,811
for having
everything you want.

1624
01:22:40,879 --> 01:22:48,751
 only make believe
i'm near you 

1625
01:22:48,819 --> 01:22:55,424
 only make believe
that you're with me 

1626
01:22:55,491 --> 01:22:57,025
 girls and boys 

1627
01:22:57,093 --> 01:23:01,662
 find it fun
just pretending 

1628
01:23:01,730 --> 01:23:07,368
 couldn't you?
Couldn't i? 

1629
01:23:07,436 --> 01:23:12,272
 couldn't we? 

1630
01:23:15,176 --> 01:23:18,477
and if i'm
a little late
in coming back,

1631
01:23:18,545 --> 01:23:20,145
you just
remember

1632
01:23:20,213 --> 01:23:23,815
and pretend
that i've never
been away.

1633
01:23:23,882 --> 01:23:27,318
Will you,
sweetheart?

1634
01:23:27,386 --> 01:23:36,793
 best of all,
make believe
i love you 

1635
01:23:36,861 --> 01:23:42,465
 for to tell
the truth 

1636
01:23:42,532 --> 01:23:46,102
 l... 

1637
01:23:49,538 --> 01:23:53,975
ahem. Her class
has gone in.

1638
01:23:56,444 --> 01:23:58,746
Good-bye, darling.

1639
01:23:58,813 --> 01:24:00,614
Good-bye, daddy.

1640
01:24:01,549 --> 01:24:03,016
Kim.

1641
01:24:04,551 --> 01:24:05,952
Be sure to tell
your mother

1642
01:24:06,020 --> 01:24:07,754
that i came
to see you.

1643
01:24:07,821 --> 01:24:09,288
Will you,
sweetheart?

1644
01:24:09,356 --> 01:24:11,456
All right, daddy.
I'll tell her.

1645
01:24:20,198 --> 01:24:22,299
Say, where
are you going?

1646
01:24:22,367 --> 01:24:23,768
I want to see
mr. Green.

1647
01:24:23,835 --> 01:24:25,336
Can't see him now.
Rehearsal.

1648
01:24:25,404 --> 01:24:27,003
He told me not to
let anybody in.

1649
01:24:27,071 --> 01:24:28,405
Can we wait
out here?

1650
01:24:28,472 --> 01:24:30,940
Sure, but don't walk
on the wet floor.

1651
01:24:31,008 --> 01:24:33,276
Oh. Come on, noli.
Sit down over here.

1652
01:25:19,050 --> 01:25:20,717
All right, jake.
Call them at 12:00.

1653
01:25:20,785 --> 01:25:22,652
[Man]
O.k., girls,
12:00 tomorrow.

1654
01:25:22,719 --> 01:25:24,720
Come on, julie.
Let's hear the new song.

1655
01:25:24,788 --> 01:25:26,622
I don't feel like
singing.

1656
01:25:26,690 --> 01:25:28,157
Oh, don't you?

1657
01:25:28,225 --> 01:25:30,192
What do you
feel like doing,
duchess?

1658
01:25:30,259 --> 01:25:32,427
I feel like
going off on a tear.

1659
01:25:32,495 --> 01:25:34,496
Come on, julie.
Let mr. Green hear the song.

1660
01:25:34,564 --> 01:25:36,198
Come on, julie.

1661
01:25:37,532 --> 01:25:39,700
It's a good one,
mr. Green.

1662
01:25:46,373 --> 01:25:51,010
 i used to dream
that i would
discover 

1663
01:25:51,078 --> 01:25:54,680
 the perfect
lover someday 

1664
01:25:54,747 --> 01:25:57,516
 i knew
i'd recognize him 

1665
01:25:57,584 --> 01:26:03,187
 if ever
he came round
my way 

1666
01:26:03,255 --> 01:26:07,024
 and i always
used to fancy then 

1667
01:26:07,092 --> 01:26:12,796
 he'd be one
of the godlike
kind of men 

1668
01:26:12,864 --> 01:26:18,033
 with a giant brain
and a noble head 

1669
01:26:18,101 --> 01:26:21,470
 like the heroes
bold 

1670
01:26:21,538 --> 01:26:25,907
 in the books
i've read 

1671
01:26:25,975 --> 01:26:29,644
 but along came bill 

1672
01:26:29,712 --> 01:26:32,980
 who's not
that type at all 

1673
01:26:33,047 --> 01:26:35,149
 you'd meet him
on the street 

1674
01:26:35,216 --> 01:26:37,451
 and never notice him 

1675
01:26:37,519 --> 01:26:40,486
 his form and face 

1676
01:26:40,554 --> 01:26:43,489
 his manly grace 

1677
01:26:43,557 --> 01:26:46,993
 are not
the kind that you 

1678
01:26:47,060 --> 01:26:50,962
 would find
in a statue 

1679
01:26:51,030 --> 01:26:54,965
 oh, i can't explain 

1680
01:26:55,033 --> 01:26:58,502
 it's surely not
his brain 

1681
01:26:58,570 --> 01:27:03,873
 that makes me thrill 

1682
01:27:03,941 --> 01:27:08,511
 i love him 

1683
01:27:08,579 --> 01:27:13,015
 because he's
wonderful 

1684
01:27:13,082 --> 01:27:20,555
 because he's
just my bill 

1685
01:27:20,622 --> 01:27:24,926
 he can't play golf
or tennis or polo 

1686
01:27:24,993 --> 01:27:28,395
 or sing a solo
or row 

1687
01:27:28,462 --> 01:27:31,264
 he isn't
half as handsome 

1688
01:27:31,332 --> 01:27:36,869
 as dozens of men
that i know 

1689
01:27:36,937 --> 01:27:41,840
 he isn't tall
or straight or slim 

1690
01:27:41,907 --> 01:27:48,913
 and he dresses far worse
than ted or jim 

1691
01:27:48,981 --> 01:27:55,886
 i can't explain
why he should be 

1692
01:27:55,954 --> 01:28:04,694
 just the one, one man
in the world for me 

1693
01:28:04,761 --> 01:28:09,464
 he's just my bill 

1694
01:28:09,532 --> 01:28:13,467
 an ordinary man 

1695
01:28:13,535 --> 01:28:19,440
 he hasn't got a thing
that i can brag about 

1696
01:28:19,507 --> 01:28:25,378
 and yet to be
upon his knee 

1697
01:28:25,446 --> 01:28:33,085
 so comfy and roomy,
seems natural to me 

1698
01:28:33,152 --> 01:28:37,421
 oh, i can't explain 

1699
01:28:37,489 --> 01:28:41,259
 it's surely not
his brain 

1700
01:28:41,326 --> 01:28:47,530
 that makes me thrill 

1701
01:28:47,598 --> 01:28:52,901
 i love him 

1702
01:28:52,969 --> 01:28:58,207
 because he's,
i don't know 

1703
01:28:58,275 --> 01:29:07,382
 because he's
just my bill 

1704
01:29:10,918 --> 01:29:12,586
use it tomorrow night,

1705
01:29:12,654 --> 01:29:14,354
and listen...
be sober.

1706
01:29:14,422 --> 01:29:15,855
I'll be sober.

1707
01:29:15,922 --> 01:29:19,492
If you want me,
i'll be in my
dressing room.

1708
01:29:20,827 --> 01:29:23,828
Queer how a woman
goes all to pieces
over a man.

1709
01:29:23,896 --> 01:29:26,231
She was the best bet
in chicago

1710
01:29:26,299 --> 01:29:29,134
till that big,
curly-haired tramp
threw her down.

1711
01:29:29,201 --> 01:29:31,069
Want to go
to radley's
for a drink?

1712
01:29:31,137 --> 01:29:32,569
Yeah. Thanks, boss.

1713
01:29:32,637 --> 01:29:34,438
O.k., kids!
See you tomorrow!

1714
01:29:38,677 --> 01:29:40,576
Mr. Green,
can i see you a minute?

1715
01:29:40,644 --> 01:29:42,078
I'm frank schultz
of schultz and schultz,

1716
01:29:42,146 --> 01:29:43,613
the well-known
comedy team.

1717
01:29:43,681 --> 01:29:45,381
The new act, huh?

1718
01:29:45,449 --> 01:29:46,883
I'll see you later.

1719
01:29:46,950 --> 01:29:48,083
I want to see you...

1720
01:29:48,151 --> 01:29:49,618
what do you want?

1721
01:29:49,686 --> 01:29:51,620
I got a girl
i want you
to hear sing.

1722
01:29:51,688 --> 01:29:53,121
I ain't seeing
no more people today.

1723
01:29:53,189 --> 01:29:54,556
I thought...

1724
01:29:54,624 --> 01:29:57,591
you thought wrong!
You thought wrong!

1725
01:29:57,659 --> 01:29:59,126
Who do you
want to see?

1726
01:29:59,194 --> 01:30:00,428
Well, l...

1727
01:30:00,495 --> 01:30:01,962
that's the girl
i mean, mr. Green.

1728
01:30:02,030 --> 01:30:03,830
I'd like to sing

one of the songs
i taught her.

1758

one singer in the show,
and that's me.

she needs a job.

as late as can be 

1763
01:31:39,581 --> 01:31:45,452
 home without him
ain't no home to me 

1764

that man of mine 

1765
01:32:02,101 --> 01:32:03,268

Why, that song is the most
beautiful song i know,

i'm sorry for you!

Well, what do you want?

1771

Got a message
for you from your
prima donna.

1772

She said to tell you
she's leaving
your show flat.

1773

Where is she?

1774
01:32:18,949 --> 01:32:20,383
Just went off
in a cab.

1775
01:32:20,451 --> 01:32:22,084
She's gone off
on one of her
sprees.

1776
01:32:23,653 --> 01:32:25,120
She won't be fit
for anything

1777

let alone tomorrow night.

1778

Oh, why didn't you
stop her?

1779
01:32:28,357 --> 01:32:31,026
Say, i'm a doorman,
not a nursemaid.

1780
01:32:31,093 --> 01:32:33,127
It's enough
to drive a man crazy.

1781
01:32:33,195 --> 01:32:34,762
That settles it.
She's through!

1782
01:32:34,830 --> 01:32:37,131
Said to tell you,
if you want a girl
to fill her place,

1783
01:32:37,199 --> 01:32:39,199
you better
grab the one
that just sung.

1784
01:32:39,266 --> 01:32:40,600
Can't you use her?

1785
01:32:40,668 --> 01:32:42,635

to take chances

will you?

Let me think.

1789
01:32:51,711 --> 01:32:54,179
Her personality
is all right.

1790
01:32:54,247 --> 01:32:55,680
If we could
only teach her

ain't bad, boss,

1793
01:32:58,750 --> 01:33:00,918

trick that like this.

Don't worry. The boat

such awful luck.

They were supposed
to be here early
this afternoon.

Oh, why did that fog
have to come up
just at this time?

I know.

We'll be
in time for most
of the show, mother.

We won't see
kim's entrance.

Well, i didn't
put this fog on.
