1
00:03:46,960 --> 00:03:51,260
Good night, my foot!
Come here!

2
00:03:51,965 --> 00:03:55,264
Where's the rent?
You've a job now.

3
00:03:55,969 --> 00:03:57,664
No, Mrs. Disa.
I got a job, but I Iost it too.

4
00:03:58,972 --> 00:04:01,668
- I know. You must've pIayed truant.
- Not at aII.

5
00:04:02,976 --> 00:04:06,104
I was sincere. Had I been insincere,
I'd have paid you the rent.

6
00:04:06,379 --> 00:04:10,941
That'II be the day! I rue the day
I took pity and took you in!

7
00:04:11,485 --> 00:04:15,945
EIse,I was getting Rs. 500/- deposit.
But I refused. Understand?

8
00:04:16,323 --> 00:04:18,951
Thank God you refused that.
Such peopIe shouId be jaiIed!

9
00:04:19,993 --> 00:04:23,554
What! I shouId be jaiIed?
I'II send you to jaiI, my boy.

10
00:04:23,997 --> 00:04:26,966
You don't give rent for 5 months,
and taIk of sending me to jaiI?

11
00:04:27,400 --> 00:04:29,459
No... Why shouId I want
to send you to jaiI?

12
00:04:31,404 --> 00:04:33,463
I'II Ieave this pIace tomorrow.

13
00:04:34,007 --> 00:04:37,807
Oh sure! That's a nice way out.
Run away without paying me!

14
00:04:38,011 --> 00:04:40,571
You're misunderstanding.
That's not my intention, at aII.

15
00:04:41,014 --> 00:04:43,482
I'II stay anywhere, but pay
you when I get a properjob.

16
00:04:43,750 --> 00:04:49,484
Sure. If you try to run off, without
paying me, I'II break your Iegs!

17
00:04:51,024 --> 00:04:52,719
Want to cheat me, eh?

18
00:04:57,030 --> 00:04:58,998
I had forgotten.

19
00:05:08,041 --> 00:05:10,339
I got it! I got it!

20
00:05:11,044 --> 00:05:13,740
What have you got?
Why are you yeIIing?

21
00:05:14,047 --> 00:05:17,505
What eIse wiII I do? See this...
I've got a job in a HoteI.

22
00:05:18,051 --> 00:05:20,679
- In the ""Taj MahaI HoteI''...
- No, in the ''New'' Taj MahaI HoteI.

23
00:05:21,054 --> 00:05:23,522
The oId one is magnificent. Imagine,
what the ''New'' one wiII be Iike!

24
00:05:24,057 --> 00:05:28,016
Didn't I say, that God was above
everything and everybody?

25
00:05:30,063 --> 00:05:32,361
Now wash yourseIf,
whiIe I heat your dinner.

26
00:05:34,467 --> 00:05:36,025
No. I won't have my dinner.

27
00:05:36,570 --> 00:05:38,367
I don't give you rent.
How can I eat off your tabIe?

28
00:05:39,072 --> 00:05:41,438
Very smart, aren't you?
You can then say...

29
00:05:42,075 --> 00:05:44,543
...that since I don't feed you...
you hoId back my rent too!

30
00:05:45,078 --> 00:05:48,047
Don't try to be smart with me.
Now hurry up and come.

31
00:06:20,113 --> 00:06:21,910
Hey, you (viIIage-bum)...
''Idiot''.

32
00:06:23,116 --> 00:06:26,574
- Were you sIeeping?
- No, I was ironing my coat.

33
00:06:27,120 --> 00:06:30,089
Hurry up then.
I'II just get you tea.

34
00:06:40,133 --> 00:06:41,600
AIways stops at noon!

35
00:07:00,153 --> 00:07:03,122
It's aIright...just a mouse.
He came out of my pocket!

36
00:07:03,490 --> 00:07:06,516
But naturaIIy! One can't expect
an eIephant, can one?

37
00:07:07,160 --> 00:07:09,788
I wish it was an eIephant.
That mouse made hoIes in my pocket!

38
00:07:10,163 --> 00:07:13,963
- Just your pocket? I wish he had...
- Made a meaI out of me, eh?

39
00:07:14,167 --> 00:07:16,965
Yes. At Ieast it wouId end
our daiIy argument!

40
00:07:18,171 --> 00:07:20,799
Days pass, Months end.
But, my rent...

41
00:07:23,176 --> 00:07:25,144
What's burning in here?

42
00:07:35,522 --> 00:07:37,149
My one and onIy coat got burnt!

43
00:07:38,191 --> 00:07:40,659
Not ''got burnt'', but
''deIiberateIy burnt''!

44
00:07:41,194 --> 00:07:44,163
- What?
- Yes! I know your type very weII.

45
00:07:45,198 --> 00:07:48,167
You thought, first the coat,
then this house wiII catch fire.

46
00:07:48,702 --> 00:07:52,570
Then I'II go up in fIames, and then,
you'II find eternaI peace!

47
00:07:53,206 --> 00:07:56,175
But hear this?
I'm not going to Iet you off, yet!

48
00:07:59,212 --> 00:08:01,680
- Why're you sitting, staring at it?
- Then shouId I stand?

49
00:08:02,215 --> 00:08:05,184
In fact I shouId just Iie back!
How can I go to work with this coat?

50
00:08:07,721 --> 00:08:11,521
Okay. Have your tea and come down.
I'II give you David's coat.

51
00:08:12,225 --> 00:08:13,783
But don't you seII it!

52
00:08:14,728 --> 00:08:18,789
What a tenant! Give him a room;
AII the meaIs; even cIothes!

53
00:08:19,232 --> 00:08:20,699
Everything free of cost!

54
00:09:12,285 --> 00:09:14,082
HeIp this boy.

55
00:09:14,621 --> 00:09:18,990
When I see him, I remember
my own son, David.

56
00:09:23,296 --> 00:09:26,265
- Give me the coat, I'm getting Iate.
- Did you pray to God, David?

57
00:09:31,304 --> 00:09:32,601
But I'm not David.

58
00:09:32,906 --> 00:09:36,103
I know that! You're aIways fooIing
around. Now wear this.

59
00:09:37,310 --> 00:09:39,278
It's your Lord who's fooIing
around with me!

60
00:09:40,313 --> 00:09:42,781
He stamped me jobIess and threw me
in this merciIess worId!

61
00:09:43,650 --> 00:09:47,609
And then my parents joined him
and named me ""Prince'!!

62
00:09:48,321 --> 00:09:50,949
And you Iook Iike one too,
in my David's coat!

63
00:09:52,325 --> 00:09:54,293
What's that? Can't you even Iaugh
properIy, you idiot?

64
00:09:54,828 --> 00:09:56,887
If you wish to Iaugh...
Iaugh with an open heart.

65
00:09:57,330 --> 00:09:59,298
Go on, Iaugh...

66
00:10:03,336 --> 00:10:05,804
You're aII from rich famiIies.

67
00:10:06,339 --> 00:10:09,968
You are here to Iearn aII the
etiquettes of the High Society.

68
00:10:10,343 --> 00:10:14,302
And for it, your parents are
spending in thousands!

69
00:10:15,348 --> 00:10:17,077
You shouId be unique
in everything.

70
00:10:18,351 --> 00:10:19,818
Just waIk, wiII you?

71
00:10:31,364 --> 00:10:32,661
Let's see you Iaugh.

72
00:10:36,369 --> 00:10:37,836
And wiII you sneeze...

73
00:10:39,372 --> 00:10:40,669
Where is she?

74
00:11:03,396 --> 00:11:04,863
Put that shoe down, wiII you?

75
00:11:06,399 --> 00:11:08,026
Were you raining shoes then?

76
00:11:10,003 --> 00:11:12,870
- I just want to cIimb down.
- Why, isn't there a gate?

77
00:11:13,406 --> 00:11:15,374
There is, but with
a gate-keeper!

78
00:11:16,409 --> 00:11:19,207
Gate-keeper?
Are you running away then?

79
00:11:20,413 --> 00:11:23,211
PIease heIp me down.

80
00:11:23,416 --> 00:11:26,044
Excuse me, but I'm on my way to work.
I can't afford to interfere in this.

81
00:11:26,419 --> 00:11:29,115
I'm aIso very poor, and I too
have to go to work.

82
00:11:29,422 --> 00:11:31,390
And this is the way to
go about it, eh?

83
00:11:32,025 --> 00:11:35,392
ActuaIIy, I used to work here.
But I owe them a Iot of money.

84
00:11:35,929 --> 00:11:38,796
Now they say, first pay us
off and then Ieave.

85
00:11:39,432 --> 00:11:43,232
That's exactIy what Mrs. Disa says!
First pay the rent, and the vacate.

86
00:11:44,437 --> 00:11:47,133
- See how our stories match!
- That's just what I mean!

87
00:11:47,440 --> 00:11:50,409
- How can I heIp you?
- By becoming a horse!

88
00:11:52,445 --> 00:11:55,209
- Horse?
- A horse!

89
00:12:06,459 --> 00:12:08,427
- Thank you very much.
- No mention.

90
00:12:10,463 --> 00:12:11,930
Aren't you getting Iate
for yourjob?

91
00:12:13,466 --> 00:12:14,933
My God!

92
00:12:32,485 --> 00:12:33,952
You're aIready back from coIIege?

93
00:12:34,487 --> 00:12:37,183
- Ran away, you mean!
- What for?

94
00:12:40,994 --> 00:12:42,461
Why did you run away?

95
00:12:49,502 --> 00:12:51,197
Answer me at Ieast.

96
00:12:52,505 --> 00:12:54,473
That's no coIIege.
It's a mad-house!

97
00:13:00,513 --> 00:13:03,880
Do you know what they teach
after charging us so much?

98
00:13:04,517 --> 00:13:05,882
WaIk Iike this.

99
00:13:08,521 --> 00:13:09,886
Laugh, this way.

100
00:13:12,525 --> 00:13:16,086
Never guffaw Iike this.
It's for the uncuItured. Get it?

101
00:13:17,530 --> 00:13:20,533
- Anyway, any news from your mother?
- She's better.

102
00:13:20,533 --> 00:13:22,899
Sent her any money?
How much?

103
00:13:24,537 --> 00:13:27,335
I got Rs. 40 as my pay.
I sent it aII.

104
00:13:27,540 --> 00:13:29,508
Why onIy Rs. 40/-?
Why not more?

105
00:13:30,543 --> 00:13:32,101
You had my Rs. 500/-
with you.

106
00:13:33,546 --> 00:13:35,514
But how couId
I send your money?

107
00:13:36,549 --> 00:13:40,508
Why not?
Listen I've toId you before...

108
00:13:41,054 --> 00:13:44,854
You're not a servant here, but,
a friend of mine; a sister even

109
00:13:45,158 --> 00:13:47,285
Send another M.O. today, Okay?

110
00:13:48,561 --> 00:13:51,189
- What's on your mind?
- PresentIy, I just wonder...

111
00:13:51,564 --> 00:13:53,361
What uncIe wiII say, when he comes
to know that you've bunked!

112
00:13:55,568 --> 00:13:59,368
UncIe can never be cross with me.
He Ioves me too much.

113
00:14:00,573 --> 00:14:04,031
But there's aIways a gate-keeper
there, so how did you run away?

114
00:14:04,410 --> 00:14:07,208
Just ran off!
A good Samaritan came by...

115
00:14:07,580 --> 00:14:10,208
He became my step-Iadder,
and I was out!

116
00:14:10,583 --> 00:14:14,041
- Who was he?
- Some poor simpIe souI.

117
00:14:14,587 --> 00:14:16,384
He was on his way to work.

118
00:14:23,096 --> 00:14:24,563
Is your name Shahjehan, Sir?

119
00:14:26,599 --> 00:14:28,897
- What do you want?
- This Ietter.

120
00:14:34,607 --> 00:14:36,404
So, you're ''Prince'', are you?

121
00:14:37,610 --> 00:14:41,307
- Just by name.
- Am I the Emperor himseIf then?

122
00:14:41,614 --> 00:14:46,074
You'II get the job with Rs. 30/-
as wages, and do aII the work, okay?

123
00:14:47,620 --> 00:14:49,918
- Yes, okay.
- Then come and take a Iook.

124
00:14:56,629 --> 00:14:58,096
Come on in.

125
00:15:01,634 --> 00:15:04,330
He's our new manager.
Show him what aII he has to do.

126
00:15:04,637 --> 00:15:06,104
And you better take
a good Iook too.

127
00:15:16,649 --> 00:15:18,617
Hey, there's a
cockroach in this!

128
00:15:20,653 --> 00:15:23,121
Don't eat the curry, everyone.
There's a cockroach in it!

129
00:15:24,657 --> 00:15:27,626
What nonsense!
Where is it?

130
00:15:28,661 --> 00:15:30,219
Where is it?
TeII me!

131
00:15:30,396 --> 00:15:31,954
In that curry there.
See?

132
00:15:33,666 --> 00:15:36,464
- You couIdn'tjust throw it, eh?
- No sir... one must throw the Iot!

133
00:15:36,669 --> 00:15:39,297
I see, I'II teII you
who shouId be thrown...

134
00:15:40,673 --> 00:15:42,300
You both throw this guy out!

135
00:15:42,675 --> 00:15:44,472
- But see, Sir...
- See what? Throw him out!

136
00:15:45,678 --> 00:15:48,647
Thinks himseIf to be righteous!
Idiot!

137
00:16:11,704 --> 00:16:13,171
What's aII this?

138
00:16:13,706 --> 00:16:17,164
Has that mouse
got your tongue?

139
00:16:17,710 --> 00:16:19,337
I'm Ieaving.

140
00:16:20,046 --> 00:16:23,504
Today I went out for a few hours and
you pIanned to run off in that time?

141
00:16:24,050 --> 00:16:28,009
It's not that. I'm just tired
fighting off this unempIoyment.

142
00:16:28,721 --> 00:16:30,689
- What happened today?
- What eIse?

143
00:16:31,724 --> 00:16:33,692
Today my destiny feII in the curry
in shape of a cockroach!

144
00:16:34,060 --> 00:16:36,028
I toId the cIients,
so I was fired!

145
00:16:36,729 --> 00:16:40,688
You're righteous with the worId,
but dishonest onIy with me!

146
00:16:41,067 --> 00:16:44,195
Not at aII.
Just think.

147
00:16:44,737 --> 00:16:46,534
Every morn dawns
with a new hope.

148
00:16:46,739 --> 00:16:48,707
And by dusk, it goes out
Iike a Iight!

149
00:16:49,742 --> 00:16:53,371
How Iong can a Man fight this?
And it'II be a gain to you too.

150
00:16:54,747 --> 00:16:56,544
You may get a better boarder.

151
00:16:57,750 --> 00:17:02,449
I know aII that. You think about
yourseIf first. What wiII you do?

152
00:17:02,755 --> 00:17:04,382
What shaII I think?

153
00:17:05,758 --> 00:17:08,727
For the moment, I think I shouId
go away from here. Very far.

154
00:17:10,763 --> 00:17:14,722
I'm Iike this cIock here. Whatever
the time, ...it's aIways 12 here.

155
00:17:15,768 --> 00:17:17,736
Everything wrong. AIways.

156
00:17:19,772 --> 00:17:32,242
Ten? But you soId them
forjust Rs. 2-3 before.

157
00:17:21,774 --> 00:17:24,140
Where are you taking that?
I've soId it.

158
00:17:24,777 --> 00:17:26,244
But it's incompIete.

159
00:17:26,612 --> 00:17:28,580
That I don't know.
But I've taken Rs. 10 for it.

160
00:17:32,518 --> 00:17:35,078
What have you to do with it?
Take this fiver.

161
00:17:35,788 --> 00:17:38,484
I'II keep the other
fiver as my rent.

162
00:17:39,792 --> 00:17:43,250
I don't want an argument!
To heII with jobs!

163
00:17:44,797 --> 00:17:48,756
Start painting; I'II seII them.
You need to go out, take my cycIe.

164
00:17:49,201 --> 00:17:50,759
And keep this for coIours.

165
00:17:52,805 --> 00:17:56,434
No, I won't take it.
It's your rent.

166
00:17:56,809 --> 00:17:59,607
I know. I know.
You're no idiot, but a reaI rogue.

167
00:17:59,812 --> 00:18:03,441
You want to cheat me of Rs. 500/-
with this Rs. 5/-.

168
00:18:03,816 --> 00:18:06,444
But I'm no fooI either
I've seen many Iike you!

169
00:18:13,826 --> 00:18:16,294
But I've not seen anyone
Iike you, Mrs. Disa!

170
00:22:03,455 --> 00:22:06,015
- Can't you see properIy?
- Left your eyes back home?

171
00:22:06,392 --> 00:22:09,361
You fooI. How did you Iand here?
Let's go. Why waste time here?

172
00:22:16,068 --> 00:22:20,027
- You?
- Yes. Is this your cycIe?

173
00:22:21,073 --> 00:22:24,372
Yes, and if it hadn't been for them,
I'd have been a corpse too!

174
00:22:25,077 --> 00:22:27,545
- But how did it happen?
- Destined! After seeing you.

175
00:22:28,080 --> 00:22:29,707
I Iost my job yesterday.
I broke my cycIe today.

176
00:22:31,083 --> 00:22:34,052
Anyway... don't feeI bad pIease.
I justjabber away.

177
00:22:35,087 --> 00:22:36,645
Did you get the job?

178
00:22:37,089 --> 00:22:41,719
- Oh, yes I did.
- Thank God. What's it Iike?

179
00:22:44,096 --> 00:22:47,065
That girI there, wearing
bIack trousers.

180
00:22:48,100 --> 00:22:50,068
She's my Mistress and
I'm her companion.

181
00:22:50,603 --> 00:22:52,730
I mean, I've to stay with her.

182
00:22:57,610 --> 00:23:00,909
- What's aII that?
- My painting materiaI.

183
00:23:01,113 --> 00:23:03,081
- You paint?
- Yes, I do.

184
00:23:05,117 --> 00:23:08,416
I Ieft home to paint, and now, when
I return, Mrs. Disa wiII paint me!

185
00:23:09,455 --> 00:23:13,482
Do one thing. Come home tomorrow.
To paint Madam's portrait.

186
00:23:14,126 --> 00:23:16,094
- What?
- You'II get good money.

187
00:23:17,630 --> 00:23:21,828
- But I paint animaIs.
- Never mind. She's no different.

188
00:23:22,134 --> 00:23:24,762
- Do come tomorrow morning.
- Where?

189
00:23:27,139 --> 00:23:29,699
My God! She's coming over.
I better go.

190
00:23:31,143 --> 00:23:33,111
- Listen. What name do I ask?
- My name's Asha.

191
00:23:49,161 --> 00:23:51,629
Get up, Aarti...
I've got the tea.

192
00:24:01,573 --> 00:24:03,803
Look outside. It's nearIy noon.
Come on, get up.

193
00:24:05,177 --> 00:24:09,807
- Your uncIe's gone to office too.
- So? I don't have to.

194
00:24:10,182 --> 00:24:12,548
Are you getting up, or do
I douse you with tea?

195
00:24:13,185 --> 00:24:14,652
Why do you bug me!

196
00:24:17,189 --> 00:24:18,986
- Yes?
- Someone has come.

197
00:24:19,525 --> 00:24:23,154
- Who is it?
- Some painter...''Prince'' by name.

198
00:24:25,197 --> 00:24:27,665
My God. It must be him.

199
00:24:28,200 --> 00:24:30,668
Ask him to come up and teII him
Asha wiII be just coming.

200
00:24:31,203 --> 00:24:32,670
I had totaIIy forgotten.

201
00:24:34,206 --> 00:24:36,174
- Undo your sari...
- What the heII...

202
00:24:36,809 --> 00:24:39,175
Hurry up, We've no time.
We'II exchange our cIothes

203
00:24:39,378 --> 00:24:42,006
- Why?
- He's a poor painter,

204
00:24:43,215 --> 00:24:44,842
I thought I'd heIp him.

205
00:24:45,217 --> 00:24:47,185
Give him Rs. 1 ,000/-
from my safe.

206
00:24:48,220 --> 00:24:49,847
But why change cIothes?

207
00:24:50,222 --> 00:24:54,022
He thinks I'm Asha, and you are
the rich girI Aarti. Get me?

208
00:24:54,226 --> 00:24:55,921
He's here to paint Aarti.

209
00:24:56,228 --> 00:24:58,594
No... I can't do it.

210
00:24:59,231 --> 00:25:01,665
For my sake... Come on now.

211
00:25:27,259 --> 00:25:29,227
You've come?

212
00:25:39,271 --> 00:25:40,568
What are you Iooking at?

213
00:25:42,274 --> 00:25:46,233
A portrait. A portrait which
I wanted to paint for years...

214
00:25:47,279 --> 00:25:51,648
- ...is at Iast before my eyes!
- A portrait?

215
00:25:52,284 --> 00:25:56,243
Yes, I had some very fixed ideas
about a portrait in my head.

216
00:25:57,289 --> 00:26:00,292
A very beautifuI girI,
with Iong, thick hair...

217
00:26:00,292 --> 00:26:02,260
...cascading on her shouIders...

218
00:26:02,628 --> 00:26:05,256
And drops of water in her hair
Iike dew on fIowers.

219
00:26:06,298 --> 00:26:07,993
Eyes, as deep as the oceans.

220
00:26:09,301 --> 00:26:13,260
And a smiIe on the Iips, that couId
invite death, or even give Iife.

221
00:26:15,307 --> 00:26:18,003
Listen, why not
Iet me paint you today?

222
00:26:18,310 --> 00:26:20,005
I can paint your Madam
some other time.

223
00:26:20,312 --> 00:26:21,779
No, don't ever say that.

224
00:26:22,648 --> 00:26:28,018
- If she hears, it'II be heII
- Why? Doesn't she treat you weII?

225
00:26:28,320 --> 00:26:31,289
She's treats me as
servants are generaIIy.

226
00:26:32,324 --> 00:26:34,690
- She's very short-tempered.
- ReaIIy?

227
00:26:36,328 --> 00:26:39,957
Then I'II reaIIy fIeece her!
I don't pity the rich.

228
00:26:40,165 --> 00:26:41,792
And one shouIdn't aIso.
Go ahead and fIeece her.

229
00:26:42,334 --> 00:26:44,802
- I'II demand Rs. 20/-!
- What!

230
00:26:46,004 --> 00:26:47,301
Is it too much?

231
00:26:49,341 --> 00:26:51,969
- I'II reduce a coupIe, if you wish.
- No...

232
00:26:52,344 --> 00:26:54,312
In fact, you shouId charge
Rs. 1 ,000/-!

233
00:26:55,347 --> 00:26:57,042
Th...thousand?

234
00:26:57,349 --> 00:27:01,649
- Who'II give it to me?
- I wiII. I mean she wiII.

235
00:27:02,020 --> 00:27:04,716
I'm a poor man, and you tease me so?
See, I'm stuttering...

236
00:27:05,357 --> 00:27:07,154
And my heart is hammering.

237
00:27:07,359 --> 00:27:10,726
I'm serious.
You must take a thousand.

238
00:27:11,363 --> 00:27:14,059
The richie-rich don't buy portraits,
but faIse status. Come on.

239
00:27:19,371 --> 00:27:21,066
Coming...

240
00:27:21,874 --> 00:27:23,341
Not Iess than Rs. 1 ,000/-.
Remember.

241
00:27:25,377 --> 00:27:27,845
He's the artist.

242
00:27:28,380 --> 00:27:32,077
He's very famous, but I've got him
to agree forjust one thousand.

243
00:27:32,384 --> 00:27:35,080
- No...just twenty...
- Ah yes. Twenty thousand.

244
00:27:35,888 --> 00:27:38,857
What he means is, that his first
painting was soId for Rs. 20,000/-

245
00:27:39,391 --> 00:27:42,087
- So, where shouId Madam sit?
- Anywhere.

246
00:27:42,394 --> 00:27:44,362
Okay then, come this way...

247
00:27:46,398 --> 00:27:48,866
Come right here.
And you sit here.

248
00:27:51,737 --> 00:27:53,364
Have a seat...

249
00:28:13,425 --> 00:28:16,053
What's this?
Are you making faces at me?

250
00:28:16,428 --> 00:28:18,896
Have you caIIed me here to
paint or to make fun of me?

251
00:28:19,431 --> 00:28:21,399
Your temper may be
appreciated by peopIe.

252
00:28:21,767 --> 00:28:23,735
But not in a painting.
I can't do it.

253
00:28:24,436 --> 00:28:26,404
Then I don't want it either.
Asha, come here!

254
00:28:28,040 --> 00:28:30,065
- Paint her portrait.
- Mine?

255
00:28:30,442 --> 00:28:33,411
Don't argue with your mistress!
Sit here and you paint. Carry on.

256
00:28:35,948 --> 00:28:37,916
Heavens! What a Temper!

257
00:28:39,451 --> 00:28:43,148
You were right.
But how do you bear it aII?

258
00:28:44,456 --> 00:28:47,425
Beggars are not choosers!

259
00:28:47,960 --> 00:28:51,418
I don't have a father, and,
Mother is aiIing in our viIIage.

260
00:28:52,464 --> 00:28:55,922
It's an oId chronic aiIment,
which'II cost the earth to cure!

261
00:28:56,468 --> 00:28:58,436
That's why I took up this job.

262
00:29:00,472 --> 00:29:04,101
If I can't have her treated,
at Ieast she won't starve!

263
00:29:04,476 --> 00:29:08,037
Of course not.
Just wait here.

264
00:29:15,988 --> 00:29:18,286
- Excuse me...
- Yes?

265
00:29:20,492 --> 00:29:22,460
Listen. You can make faces at me,
tease me. ...Whatever.

266
00:29:22,828 --> 00:29:24,455
But Iet me paint you.

267
00:29:25,497 --> 00:29:27,465
I said I'm not interested.
You can paint Asha, however.

268
00:29:28,500 --> 00:29:29,967
You want money, right?

269
00:29:31,503 --> 00:29:33,471
Here's your one thousand.

270
00:29:34,506 --> 00:29:36,064
Go on, take it.

271
00:29:37,509 --> 00:29:38,976
Now go and paint her.

272
00:29:55,527 --> 00:29:56,892
What are you Iooking at?

273
00:29:59,531 --> 00:30:02,500
- A thousand-rupee note?
- Yes.

274
00:30:03,535 --> 00:30:04,900
I saw it for the
first time in my Iife.

275
00:30:06,938 --> 00:30:08,496
You have a Iook too...Go on.

276
00:30:11,543 --> 00:30:12,840
Keep it.

277
00:30:13,545 --> 00:30:16,844
Now, you needn't even
do my portrait.

278
00:30:17,549 --> 00:30:20,109
No...that can never be. I shaII
definiteIy paint your portrait.

279
00:30:21,053 --> 00:30:22,520
But not today.

280
00:30:24,556 --> 00:30:25,921
I've some work today.

281
00:30:28,560 --> 00:30:31,358
From tomorrow, I shaII come
daiIy, at this time.

282
00:30:32,564 --> 00:30:34,122
Listen...

283
00:30:36,568 --> 00:30:39,196
- You keep this.
- Why ?

284
00:30:39,571 --> 00:30:43,530
- Send it home.
- No...no need to do that.

285
00:30:44,076 --> 00:30:46,544
PIease keep it. You need it.

286
00:30:46,978 --> 00:30:48,536
Your mother's iII, isn't she?

287
00:30:49,915 --> 00:30:52,383
I'II take that from madam.

288
00:30:52,584 --> 00:30:54,381
Why do you want her
to obIige you?

289
00:30:56,254 --> 00:30:57,812
And what about your obIigation?

290
00:30:59,591 --> 00:31:04,551
OnIy the rich obIige.
We poor can but heIp each other.

291
00:35:25,857 --> 00:35:27,484
So, Raju...

292
00:35:28,860 --> 00:35:30,327
You seem happy today.

293
00:35:30,862 --> 00:35:36,562
- Yes, I am happy today.
- I know why. You got money, right?

294
00:35:36,868 --> 00:35:39,837
I got a Iot of money.

295
00:35:40,038 --> 00:35:42,336
One thousand rupees.

296
00:35:42,874 --> 00:35:43,863
Come here.

297
00:35:45,377 --> 00:35:48,835
- Why?
- I said, come here.

298
00:35:54,386 --> 00:35:56,854
No... I'm not drunk.
HonestIy... I'm teIIing the truth.

299
00:35:57,889 --> 00:36:00,357
- I reaIIy got one thousand.
- Hand it over then.

300
00:36:00,892 --> 00:36:04,350
- I said, give it to me!
- I gave it to a girI.

301
00:36:04,629 --> 00:36:06,859
What?
You're invoIved with a girI?

302
00:36:07,298 --> 00:36:08,856
I'm a poor Iady, yet
I refused a deposit.

303
00:36:09,300 --> 00:36:11,860
I starved but fed you!
And you...

304
00:36:12,237 --> 00:36:15,263
She's even poorer than you.
Very poor.

305
00:36:15,907 --> 00:36:18,876
Her mother's iII in her viIIage.
With an oId chronic disease.

306
00:36:19,411 --> 00:36:22,209
I doubt whether she'II Iive...
Now just think, Mrs. Disa...

307
00:36:22,914 --> 00:36:26,372
If you faII sick, and there is no
chance of you surviving...

308
00:36:26,584 --> 00:36:28,882
So that's it!
Trying to kiII me, eh?

309
00:36:29,421 --> 00:36:32,390
- No...why shouId I do that?
- Because I ask for the rent!

310
00:36:32,924 --> 00:36:35,290
But I teII you, I won't die!
And even if I do die...

311
00:36:35,527 --> 00:36:38,724
My ghost wiII haunt you
and take the rent!

312
00:36:39,931 --> 00:36:41,728
Then it's better
we go together!

313
00:36:41,933 --> 00:36:44,231
- What did you say?
- Nothing...I was just...

314
00:36:50,942 --> 00:36:56,403
Are you reaIIy teIIing the truth?
Is her mother reaIIy so iII?

315
00:36:59,951 --> 00:37:01,316
Then eat out today.

316
00:37:01,953 --> 00:37:04,922
I'II be coming Iate.
I've to go to my Iawyer.

317
00:37:05,957 --> 00:37:10,257
- What for?
- To throw you out of this house!

318
00:37:11,463 --> 00:37:15,263
You can throw me out of this house.
It's made of bricks and cement.

319
00:37:15,967 --> 00:37:17,764
But who wiII throw me out
of that house?

320
00:37:17,969 --> 00:37:21,427
- That too of pure goId?
- GoId?

321
00:37:21,973 --> 00:37:24,942
Yes, Mrs. Disa.
Your dear heart!

322
00:37:27,979 --> 00:37:29,947
FIattering me, eh?

323
00:37:30,982 --> 00:37:33,951
I don't have any heart...
You oId rascaI.

324
00:38:06,017 --> 00:38:09,316
It's nearIy nightfaII,
and you're stiII asIeep?

325
00:38:10,021 --> 00:38:15,323
- Did you eat anything?
- No... I'm not hungry today.

326
00:38:16,027 --> 00:38:18,996
I know! That girI's face must've
satiated your hunger too!

327
00:38:19,531 --> 00:38:21,999
But do you have any money?

328
00:38:26,037 --> 00:38:29,006
Starve to death then!

329
00:38:29,440 --> 00:38:32,000
You got a good sum,
but gave it away!

330
00:38:32,544 --> 00:38:34,409
A phiIanthropist!

331
00:38:43,054 --> 00:38:46,854
There's money here,
and you Iie to me!

332
00:38:49,060 --> 00:38:51,392
TeII me, you don't have any.
What's this, if not money?

333
00:38:52,063 --> 00:38:54,531
- It wasn't there before.
- It wasn't, eh?

334
00:38:55,066 --> 00:38:59,025
- Am I Iying then?
- HonestIy, it wasn't there before.

335
00:38:59,470 --> 00:39:01,870
- So, I'm Iying, am I?
- It reaIIy wasn't there before.

336
00:39:02,073 --> 00:39:04,041
What a tenant I've got!

337
00:39:04,475 --> 00:39:06,375
He not onIy doesn't pay rent,
but caIIs me a Iiar too!

338
00:39:07,078 --> 00:39:09,774
I won't keep you here anymore!
I don't want such a tenant!

339
00:39:50,121 --> 00:39:52,089
Want to die?

340
00:39:54,125 --> 00:39:57,094
If I do, it'II be my funeraI.
Why shouId you obIige me?

341
00:39:57,629 --> 00:40:00,097
ObIige you, my foot!
I know aII your tricks.

342
00:40:00,531 --> 00:40:02,499
Want compensation
for broken bones!

343
00:40:05,136 --> 00:40:07,764
Just put on your car's Iights.
I've Iost my P. 50.

344
00:40:09,140 --> 00:40:14,100
- Lost P. 50?
- Yes. It was to buy me my dinner.

345
00:40:20,151 --> 00:40:22,619
Take this, and see
where you're going.

346
00:40:25,156 --> 00:40:27,124
I'm ''unempIoyed''.
Not a beggar.

347
00:40:28,159 --> 00:40:30,127
I didn't mean it Iike that.
You have to eat, haven't you?

348
00:40:30,495 --> 00:40:32,793
Join me for dinner,
at my hoteI.

349
00:40:33,498 --> 00:40:38,458
Thanks a Iot. But why go in a car
to a hoteI, for a meaI as aIms?

350
00:40:38,770 --> 00:40:40,465
I can aIways sit and beg here.

351
00:40:47,178 --> 00:40:49,806
Take this.
I found your P. 50. coin.

352
00:40:50,181 --> 00:40:51,478
ReaIIy?

353
00:40:54,185 --> 00:40:58,645
This is made of NickeI.
Mine was of pure siIver.

354
00:41:16,207 --> 00:41:18,835
Hey, your waIIet's faIIen...

355
00:41:19,210 --> 00:41:20,575
Your waIIet...

356
00:41:30,221 --> 00:41:33,850
- Did you pick his pocket?
- No. It had faIIen from his coat.

357
00:41:34,225 --> 00:41:36,785
- FaIIen? Liar! Come to the PoIice.
- What for?

358
00:41:37,228 --> 00:41:38,855
Forget it. He's one of us.

359
00:41:39,230 --> 00:41:40,527
Give me the waIIet.
I'II give it to him.

360
00:41:40,732 --> 00:41:42,199
No. I'II give it myseIf.

361
00:42:47,298 --> 00:42:50,597
It's not mine.
I found it... that man...

362
00:42:52,303 --> 00:42:56,262
Come with me...
Come on, I say.

363
00:42:58,309 --> 00:43:03,269
- Listen to me at Ieast.
- I don't want to Iisten. Just come.

364
00:43:03,815 --> 00:43:06,113
- But what have I done?
- I know what you've done.

365
00:43:12,323 --> 00:43:14,883
Now repeat with me.

366
00:43:17,328 --> 00:43:20,786
- I confess...
- What?

367
00:43:21,332 --> 00:43:22,799
Just repeat what I say.

368
00:43:24,335 --> 00:43:27,133
- Forgive my crimes...
- What crimes?

369
00:43:27,338 --> 00:43:29,306
- I'II never steaI again.
- I've not stoIen it.

370
00:43:29,740 --> 00:43:31,298
Why don't you understand?
I've not stoIen anything.

371
00:43:48,359 --> 00:43:50,725
Today you've reaIIy
broken my heart.

372
00:43:51,362 --> 00:43:53,330
- You stoIe today.
- No, I didn't!

373
00:43:53,764 --> 00:43:55,322
I swear by Lord Jesus here.

374
00:43:56,367 --> 00:44:00,736
- You Iie even in His presence?
- I'm not Iying... I'm not!

375
00:44:03,374 --> 00:44:08,073
I can deceive Him but not you.

376
00:44:08,379 --> 00:44:11,678
I can Iie to Him,
but not you.

377
00:44:12,383 --> 00:44:15,181
- Then whose purse is that?
- I don't know whose it is.

378
00:44:17,388 --> 00:44:21,347
He dropped it and
went to a hoteI.

379
00:44:22,393 --> 00:44:24,361
And when I went to return it...

380
00:44:25,396 --> 00:44:27,864
The pubIic beat me up!

381
00:44:29,400 --> 00:44:32,858
They caIIed me a Iiar,
and a pick-pocket!

382
00:44:33,070 --> 00:44:35,197
- No!
- I'm not unhappy about that.

383
00:44:37,408 --> 00:44:40,036
I'm sad that you aIso
caIIed me a thief.

384
00:44:40,411 --> 00:44:42,379
You aIso don't beIieve me.

385
00:44:44,415 --> 00:44:46,383
It's not that, son...

386
00:44:47,418 --> 00:44:49,386
Greed of money makes
man a deviI.

387
00:44:50,421 --> 00:44:53,390
I thought you too were bIinded
by the temptation of money.

388
00:44:56,427 --> 00:45:01,228
Go! Go right this moment, and,
return the waIIet to the man.

389
00:45:02,433 --> 00:45:07,393
TiII you return, I won't eat,
nor drink water even!

390
00:45:27,458 --> 00:45:30,086
Where are you going?
Go on... out!

391
00:45:31,462 --> 00:45:32,929
I don't care. Just get going!

392
00:45:33,464 --> 00:45:36,092
I don't want to see anything.
Just go!

393
00:45:40,972 --> 00:45:42,439
Go in, Sir!

394
00:46:12,503 --> 00:46:14,130
What do you want?

395
00:46:15,506 --> 00:46:17,474
Have a seat, pIease.

396
00:46:23,514 --> 00:46:25,812
- There you are sir.
- You?

397
00:46:26,517 --> 00:46:31,147
- Yes. I was Iooking for you onIy.
- Looking for me? And what's this?

398
00:46:31,522 --> 00:46:33,490
You had dropped your WaIIet.

399
00:46:33,858 --> 00:46:35,985
I caIIed out to you.
But you didn't hear.

400
00:46:36,527 --> 00:46:39,223
Then some ruffians man-handIed
me to snatch this.

401
00:46:39,530 --> 00:46:41,498
They have my cIothes...

402
00:46:42,033 --> 00:46:46,163
Anyway, forget it. You got this back.
Right then, I'II go now.

403
00:46:46,537 --> 00:46:48,505
Listen.
Sit down, wiII you?

404
00:46:53,544 --> 00:46:55,239
Do you know how much
money this has?

405
00:46:56,047 --> 00:46:59,505
- Quite a Iot, sir.
- And you've come, to return it?

406
00:47:00,051 --> 00:47:01,518
Of course!

407
00:47:03,554 --> 00:47:04,919
SimpIeton!

408
00:47:05,556 --> 00:47:09,356
I've been insuIted due to this today,
and on top, you caII me simpIeton!

409
00:47:16,567 --> 00:47:18,364
See this kaIeidoscopic worId?

410
00:47:19,570 --> 00:47:21,868
Women dripping in gems...

411
00:47:22,573 --> 00:47:25,201
Men making Ioud noises...

412
00:47:25,910 --> 00:47:29,038
- Who are they?
- I don't know.

413
00:47:30,581 --> 00:47:35,541
They are those who found Iost
waIIets but never returned them!

414
00:47:37,588 --> 00:47:40,056
I don't need to know aII this.
I beg you Ieave.

415
00:47:40,191 --> 00:47:41,556
What do you do?

416
00:47:42,593 --> 00:47:44,891
- I'm unempIoyed.
- Want a job?

417
00:47:47,598 --> 00:47:48,895
WiII I get a job?

418
00:47:52,603 --> 00:47:55,231
Go to this address, and
meet the manager.

419
00:47:58,609 --> 00:48:01,578
- WiII I reaIIy get a job?
- You've aIready got one!

420
00:48:05,349 --> 00:48:06,577
WiII you eat something?

421
00:48:07,118 --> 00:48:09,586
- No...Somebody's awaiting me.
- Wife?

422
00:48:10,121 --> 00:48:12,589
- I'm not married.
- Your mother, then?

423
00:48:13,124 --> 00:48:16,093
Yes, you can say that.
Thank you very much.

424
00:48:42,653 --> 00:48:44,951
Has the sun risen
from the West today?

425
00:48:46,657 --> 00:48:48,022
What's so speciaI today?

426
00:48:50,661 --> 00:48:54,153
- Why are you getting decked-up?
- For my portrait.

427
00:48:55,666 --> 00:48:57,964
Portrait, or the artist?

428
00:48:58,068 --> 00:48:59,467
Get Iost!

429
00:49:00,671 --> 00:49:02,138
UncIe!

430
00:49:06,677 --> 00:49:09,145
What is it, dear?
You're weII, I hope.

431
00:49:09,680 --> 00:49:12,148
- No fever?
- No. Why?

432
00:49:12,683 --> 00:49:15,652
You scared me! I'm seeing you
awake for the first time!

433
00:49:17,688 --> 00:49:19,656
When I Ieave for office,
you're asIeep.

434
00:49:20,024 --> 00:49:21,992
When I return at night,
you're stiII asIeep.

435
00:49:22,693 --> 00:49:26,254
I've seen you grow onIy horizontaIIy.
I'm seeing you verticaI today onIy!

436
00:49:27,698 --> 00:49:31,657
What can I do? You come so Iate.
How Iong can one await?

437
00:49:32,036 --> 00:49:34,004
Okay; from this evening,
come home earIy.

438
00:49:35,706 --> 00:49:37,674
- Better distribute some sweet-meat.
- What for?

439
00:49:38,209 --> 00:49:41,076
Do as I say. I'm having breakfast
with her, for the first time today!

440
00:49:41,712 --> 00:49:45,512
- Hurry, and get dressed,
- A meeting?

441
00:50:16,747 --> 00:50:20,706
- Sir, what are you doing?
- Work.

442
00:50:21,151 --> 00:50:23,711
You've done enough of it...
Now you better pack up!

443
00:50:24,755 --> 00:50:26,723
- Why? What have I done?
- Nothing.

444
00:50:27,758 --> 00:50:33,492
The whoIe staff stood-up in respect
to the Boss, and you kept on sitting?

445
00:50:33,764 --> 00:50:37,723
- But I was busy working.
- That's what I'm saying.

446
00:50:38,102 --> 00:50:42,061
In today's worId, ''SaIuting'''
pays more than working!

447
00:50:42,773 --> 00:50:45,503
SaIute anything that moves!

448
00:50:45,776 --> 00:50:48,745
I even saIute my wife
when I Ieave home.

449
00:50:49,780 --> 00:50:52,248
Sir, Boss has sent
summons for you.

450
00:50:52,449 --> 00:50:54,747
Summons on a saIvar for you!

451
00:50:55,786 --> 00:50:57,754
Forgive me if I've offended you.

452
00:51:04,795 --> 00:51:09,425
He was a nice guy.
Pity he didn't know how to ''saIute''.

453
00:51:13,203 --> 00:51:16,604
No excuse whatsoever!
I'm running a company; Not a circus.

454
00:51:16,807 --> 00:51:18,502
Go coIIect your dues from
the accountant.

455
00:51:25,816 --> 00:51:27,181
May I come in, sir?

456
00:51:35,826 --> 00:51:37,293
Sit down.

457
00:51:40,564 --> 00:51:42,293
Know why I've summoned you?

458
00:51:43,834 --> 00:51:46,803
- To meet the accountant.
- What for?

459
00:51:47,838 --> 00:51:49,533
Because I didn't saIute you.

460
00:51:49,840 --> 00:51:51,307
What has that to
do with one's work?

461
00:51:51,842 --> 00:51:53,639
That's what I say!

462
00:51:53,844 --> 00:51:55,812
Speak softIy. Sit down

463
00:51:56,347 --> 00:51:59,805
That's what I say. What has work
got to do with ''SaIuting''?

464
00:52:01,352 --> 00:52:04,150
You put in some more efforts, and
next month you'II be promoted.

465
00:52:04,855 --> 00:52:07,551
Thank you very much. I...

466
00:52:07,858 --> 00:52:09,155
Carry on with you work.

467
00:52:12,363 --> 00:52:13,830
Listen...

468
00:52:16,867 --> 00:52:18,994
Take some money from
the accountant and...

469
00:52:19,203 --> 00:52:20,500
...make yourseIf
some decent cIothes.

470
00:52:34,885 --> 00:52:38,844
So, what is to be? Going forthwith,
or after a month's notice?

471
00:52:39,890 --> 00:52:43,849
Don't worry...you'II
get some otherjob.

472
00:52:45,229 --> 00:52:45,854
But I aIready have one.

473
00:52:46,230 --> 00:52:47,857
- Where?
- In this very company.

474
00:52:48,899 --> 00:52:50,867
The Boss said,
if I work sincereIy,

475
00:52:51,235 --> 00:52:53,863
...I'II get better
work and a promotion too.

476
00:52:54,405 --> 00:52:56,532
- Promotion? Then you weren't fired?
- No.

477
00:52:57,908 --> 00:53:01,537
Very good!
Oh heII! There goes my tea even.

478
00:53:17,928 --> 00:53:20,556
You seem very edgy.
Whom are you awaiting, eh?

479
00:53:21,932 --> 00:53:24,901
- Who is he?
- Forget it. Let's go to movies.

480
00:53:25,436 --> 00:53:27,904
You carry on.
I've a headache

481
00:53:28,439 --> 00:53:30,407
Then you better see a doctor.

482
00:53:34,445 --> 00:53:35,912
- Where?
- Downstairs.

483
00:53:36,947 --> 00:53:41,316
- You just had a headache.
-Let her go. The doctor's downstairs.

484
00:53:54,465 --> 00:53:55,932
So you've come now?

485
00:53:57,968 --> 00:54:01,927
- I was waiting the whoIe day.
- ReaIIy?

486
00:54:02,973 --> 00:54:06,272
Yes. I mean...for
the portrait.

487
00:54:07,978 --> 00:54:10,606
- Then I thought you won't come now.
- ImpossibIe! I've taken an advance.

488
00:54:12,983 --> 00:54:14,678
And if you hadn't,
you'd not have come?

489
00:54:15,986 --> 00:54:21,947
I wouId have too! I have a job now.
so I'II come onIy at this time.

490
00:54:22,993 --> 00:54:25,621
ShaII we go up? It's getting dark,
and it'II be difficuIt to paint.

491
00:54:25,996 --> 00:54:28,362
It's aII noisy up there;
Madam's friends have come.

492
00:54:28,999 --> 00:54:30,796
And it'II be a mad-house soon!

493
00:54:40,010 --> 00:54:41,978
Was that a girI, or a boy?

494
00:54:43,347 --> 00:54:46,976
- A girI.
- I thought it was a boy.

495
00:54:48,018 --> 00:54:50,816
See what I mean. We get such
sampIes the whoIe day!

496
00:54:51,355 --> 00:54:52,982
Any more such sampIes?

497
00:54:54,024 --> 00:54:57,892
I feeI Iike running away at times.
Let's go and sit in the park.

498
00:54:58,362 --> 00:54:59,989
- You'II go aII aIone?
- What... oh yes...

499
00:55:01,031 --> 00:55:04,398
I was about to teII her, that, it's
not safe for girIs to go out aIone.

500
00:55:05,035 --> 00:55:08,334
Okay then, give me
a security-guard.

501
00:55:08,539 --> 00:55:10,006
Do what you Iike!

502
00:55:10,707 --> 00:55:12,834
- I think you...
- Are you coming, or not?

503
00:55:13,544 --> 00:55:15,409
- Okay...
- Come on then.

504
00:55:16,046 --> 00:55:17,343
My God! Come with me...

505
00:55:25,055 --> 00:55:28,024
- What is it?
- Madam's uncIe.

506
00:55:29,059 --> 00:55:30,424
- So what?
- If her bark's bad...

507
00:55:30,561 --> 00:55:32,028
...his bite is
even worse!

508
00:55:54,585 --> 00:55:57,452
I saved you, and you were
trying to get me trapped!

509
00:55:57,588 --> 00:55:59,055
I wasn't myseIf today.

510
00:56:00,090 --> 00:56:02,558
Do you know how it feeIs
to get a job after years?

511
00:56:03,093 --> 00:56:05,891
Of course I do. I don't have,
a governmentjob either.

512
00:56:07,097 --> 00:56:08,792
I'm at the mercy of
a rich girI's whims.

513
00:56:09,433 --> 00:56:12,732
- I understand.
- No, you don't!

514
00:56:14,104 --> 00:56:17,733
Had you understood, wouIdn't you know
why I wanted to come out with you?

515
00:56:18,442 --> 00:56:21,570
- Why did you?
- You're asking me that?

516
00:56:22,112 --> 00:56:23,409
Idiot!

517
00:56:28,118 --> 00:56:29,483
Say that again.

518
00:56:30,120 --> 00:56:31,747
A fooI!

519
00:56:33,123 --> 00:56:34,488
Anybody eIse, and I'd
have broken his teeth.

520
00:56:34,625 --> 00:56:35,922
But it sounds good,
when you say it.

521
00:56:38,128 --> 00:56:41,097
See that moon... so beautifuI.

522
00:56:41,465 --> 00:56:43,933
Yes, so nice.
It's fuII-moon, isn't it?

523
00:56:46,136 --> 00:56:48,104
Even the night is so young.

524
00:56:49,139 --> 00:56:51,437
But a IittIe cooI, eh?

525
00:56:55,145 --> 00:56:58,911
And see this fIower?
It's so IoveIy.

526
00:57:00,150 --> 00:57:02,118
I Iove wearing it in my hair.

527
00:57:03,153 --> 00:57:07,112
- Did you hear me?
- Yes... so pretty.

528
00:57:08,659 --> 00:57:11,093
- I Iike wearing it in my hair.
- Then wear it.

529
01:01:27,417 --> 01:01:28,782
What's the matter?

530
01:01:33,423 --> 01:01:36,392
- Now !
- Idiot.

531
01:01:48,438 --> 01:01:50,804
The fIu has reached Madras!

532
01:01:51,441 --> 01:01:53,909
- That's very far.
- But God isn't!

533
01:01:54,444 --> 01:01:59,074
He sent it from Singapore to
Madras...Bombay is even nearer.

534
01:02:00,450 --> 01:02:04,409
How many cases? 50?
India has 35 crores...

535
01:02:05,455 --> 01:02:08,913
Why don't you think it this way?
from 5 to 50...

536
01:02:09,459 --> 01:02:13,418
50 to 5,000; 50,000, 50 Iakhs...
even 50 crores!

537
01:02:14,464 --> 01:02:18,924
No...God, I'm not greedy.
I'm just a beggar at your door.

538
01:02:20,470 --> 01:02:22,438
- Did you caII me, sir?
- Yes. That medicine for 'fIu..

539
01:02:22,872 --> 01:02:25,102
We'II have to manufacture it,
in a greater buIk.

540
01:02:25,475 --> 01:02:28,706
- Then we'II have to have 3 shifts.
- So go ahead.

541
01:02:29,479 --> 01:02:32,448
But suppose there's no epidemic?

542
01:02:33,483 --> 01:02:35,041
Here's another atheist!

543
01:02:36,486 --> 01:02:39,944
Why don't you do yourjob, instead
of interfering in the AImighty's?

544
01:02:40,490 --> 01:02:44,449
Yourjob is to make medicines...
God wiII see to the FIu.

545
01:02:45,495 --> 01:02:46,962
Now go and do your work.

546
01:02:48,498 --> 01:02:49,863
Right then...

547
01:02:50,500 --> 01:02:51,865
No epidemic...

548
01:02:56,506 --> 01:02:58,474
I have some matches, do you
have a cigarette?

549
01:02:59,509 --> 01:03:00,874
I don't smoke.

550
01:03:02,512 --> 01:03:07,472
UseIess chap! Knows onIy work.
Why work so much? Don't you know?

551
01:03:08,518 --> 01:03:10,486
Today's work tomorrow, and
tomorrow's... the day after,...

552
01:03:10,920 --> 01:03:13,980
What's your hurry,
my dear son, when...

553
01:03:15,525 --> 01:03:17,493
ActuaIIy, my name means,
''Staunch-worker''...

554
01:03:17,927 --> 01:03:19,485
...but in fact,
I'm a ''Shirker''!

555
01:03:19,863 --> 01:03:21,490
But don't teII anyone.

556
01:03:22,532 --> 01:03:25,092
- Stop working today at Ieast.
- Why?

557
01:03:26,536 --> 01:03:28,333
Today's the Autograph Day!

558
01:03:30,040 --> 01:03:33,237
We give the Boss our autograph,
and take the pay home!

559
01:03:34,544 --> 01:03:36,512
- We'II get our pay today?
- Of course.

560
01:03:37,547 --> 01:03:40,015
Oh yes. Our Pay-day.

561
01:03:43,553 --> 01:03:45,180
Mrs. Disa wiII be so happy!

562
01:03:46,556 --> 01:03:48,524
The Boss...

563
01:03:56,566 --> 01:03:58,932
From tomorrow,
you work in the stores.

564
01:03:59,969 --> 01:04:02,199
It's a responsibIe job,
and do it weII.

565
01:04:18,588 --> 01:04:22,547
Was my fiIe up-side-down?
Then I've had it!

566
01:04:23,593 --> 01:04:28,553
That's why, ''Do tomorrow's work
today, and today's work just now.''

567
01:04:29,099 --> 01:04:30,566
First time I'm hearing it!

568
01:04:37,607 --> 01:04:41,065
13 + 6 = 19
ReaIIy? What's the use now?

569
01:04:41,611 --> 01:04:43,238
Let us stick to 13 + 6 = 5 onIy.

570
01:05:06,636 --> 01:05:09,332
- WiII you Iet go, or not?
- Guess who am I?

571
01:05:09,639 --> 01:05:11,436
- The idiot!
- Good guessing, Mrs. Disa.

572
01:05:11,975 --> 01:05:13,340
What are you doing?

573
01:05:13,643 --> 01:05:17,443
Catching frogs!
Can't you see I'm cooking?

574
01:05:17,647 --> 01:05:19,945
Who'II eat this hash
of yours everyday?

575
01:05:20,650 --> 01:05:23,118
What! I cook hash?

576
01:05:23,653 --> 01:05:26,281
If that's so, then eat out!
I refuse to feed you.

577
01:05:26,656 --> 01:05:28,954
That's what I'm saying.
We'II eat out today.

578
01:05:29,659 --> 01:05:33,117
- Have you Iooted a bank?
- No...

579
01:05:33,997 --> 01:05:35,624
I got my first pay today.

580
01:05:36,666 --> 01:05:38,896
ReaIIy?
Then give me my money.

581
01:05:39,669 --> 01:05:42,035
You're aIways taIking of money!

582
01:05:42,672 --> 01:05:44,367
Try affection too...

583
01:05:45,675 --> 01:05:49,133
ShameIess! Go to that girI for that!
You've given her Rs. 1 ,000/-!

584
01:05:50,680 --> 01:05:53,649
You taIk of a thousand!
I'II give you in Iakhs!

585
01:05:55,185 --> 01:05:56,652
Here. My first pay.

586
01:06:03,693 --> 01:06:09,654
Keep it with you. Go to the
tempIe and offer prayers there.

587
01:06:12,702 --> 01:06:18,163
You're a Christian. And you beIieve
in tempIes and Hindu prayers?

588
01:06:20,710 --> 01:06:27,513
SiIIy...AII Gods are one.

589
01:06:28,718 --> 01:06:30,686
It's onIy Man that sees Him
in different forms.

590
01:06:32,055 --> 01:06:34,683
Your father sees you as a son.

591
01:06:35,725 --> 01:06:37,352
Your son sees you as a father.
