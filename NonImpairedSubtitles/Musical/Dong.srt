1
00:00:08,755 --> 00:00:11,883
The government is going
to call off all garbage runs.

2
00:00:11,958 --> 00:00:14,756
We are being driven out of this place.

3
00:00:14,828 --> 00:00:20,892
This is not fair to the people
who live here.

4
00:00:21,501 --> 00:00:24,868
If the epidemic is really prevailing
in this area...

5
00:00:24,938 --> 00:00:27,168
they should have done something
a long time ago...

6
00:00:27,240 --> 00:00:33,076
but they didn't do a thing about it.
They didn't try to protect us.

7
00:00:33,146 --> 00:00:37,344
Now look at us. The disease is
wide-spread and everyone is sick.

8
00:00:37,417 --> 00:00:43,253
Now they want us to move into tents
and schools like refugees.

9
00:00:43,323 --> 00:00:45,052
Why should I cooperate with them?

10
00:00:45,926 --> 00:00:49,327
With no prevention,
the epidemic will break out.

11
00:00:49,396 --> 00:00:59,362
THE HOLE

12
00:00:59,439 --> 00:01:04,570
What if we were
carrying the virus?

13
00:01:04,878 --> 00:01:07,039
You can't just move us
anywhere you want to.

14
00:01:07,114 --> 00:01:10,106
Some people have
lived here for generations.

15
00:01:10,183 --> 00:01:13,084
The government can't make us
leave our homes.

16
00:01:13,153 --> 00:01:21,822
A TSAI MING-LIANG FILM

17
00:01:22,062 --> 00:01:25,793
I'll just dump my rubbish anywhere.
To hell with our government.

18
00:01:25,866 --> 00:01:30,360
I'll dump my garbage where I can't see it,
or somewhere other people can't see it.

19
00:01:30,437 --> 00:01:33,406
Or I'll just put them wherever
other people put them...

20
00:01:33,540 --> 00:01:36,441
They should burn us all,

21
00:01:36,510 --> 00:01:40,970
together with the garbage!

22
00:01:41,047 --> 00:01:42,878
Taiwan's Health Administration...

23
00:01:42,949 --> 00:01:45,076
has issued a statement...

24
00:01:45,252 --> 00:01:47,152
in response to sharp criticism
from WHO.

25
00:01:47,454 --> 00:01:53,017
Though we haven't been able to identify
the name of this epidemic or its origin,

26
00:01:53,093 --> 00:01:58,326
we are very confident that
we can take care of it in the shortest time.

27
00:01:58,632 --> 00:02:01,533
The Water Company
also announced...

28
00:02:01,735 --> 00:02:03,760
that starting in the year 2000...

29
00:02:03,837 --> 00:02:07,398
it will cut off the water supply
to all quarantine zones.

30
00:02:07,474 --> 00:02:09,135
And now here's our report.

31
00:02:09,476 --> 00:02:15,278
<i>"After thorough consideration, </i>
<i>We have come to this painful decision. "</i>

32
00:02:15,348 --> 00:02:21,810
<i>"In compliance with</i>
<i>the government's all-out evacuation"</i>

33
00:02:21,888 --> 00:02:26,086
<i>"this company will cut off</i>
<i>all water supplies to quarantine zones..."</i>

34
00:02:26,159 --> 00:02:31,597
<i>"starting midnight, January 1st, 2000. "</i>

35
00:02:32,232 --> 00:02:37,169
<i>"For those who still live</i>
<i>in the quarantine zone, please leave. "</i>

36
00:02:37,237 --> 00:02:38,966
<i>"Do not hesitate. "</i>

37
00:02:39,272 --> 00:02:42,298
<i>"It would be foolish to assume..."</i>

38
00:02:42,375 --> 00:02:44,900
<i>"one can live on rainwater. "</i>

39
00:02:45,312 --> 00:02:46,904
<i>"It is impossible. "</i>

40
00:02:47,914 --> 00:02:50,348
Seven days to go now...

41
00:02:50,417 --> 00:02:52,351
until the year 2000.

42
00:04:13,700 --> 00:04:15,930
Excuse me.
Are there any leaks in here?

43
00:04:16,336 --> 00:04:17,530
Nope.

44
00:04:18,238 --> 00:04:21,264
There's a bad leak downstairs.
One wall is dripping wet.

45
00:04:21,575 --> 00:04:24,772
They asked me to check around.
Can I have a look inside?

46
00:04:25,912 --> 00:04:27,709
But there's no problem here.

47
00:04:27,781 --> 00:04:31,012
There could be
a busted pipe still.

48
00:04:31,084 --> 00:04:33,644
I really need to have a look.
Just a peek.

49
00:04:34,888 --> 00:04:36,082
Thanks.

50
00:04:57,043 --> 00:04:58,977
Sorry for the bother.

51
00:10:22,702 --> 00:10:25,865
<i>Don't water your plants</i>
<i>with tap water. </i>

52
00:10:25,939 --> 00:10:29,067
<i>Let it sit in a container</i>
<i>for 2 or 3 days. </i>

53
00:10:29,142 --> 00:10:33,442
<i>The take surface water only, </i>
<i>using a bowl, </i>

54
00:10:33,513 --> 00:10:36,380
<i>to water your plants with it. </i>

55
00:10:36,449 --> 00:10:38,349
<i>But what about drinking water? </i>

56
00:10:38,418 --> 00:10:41,979
<i>Some families</i>
<i>don't have a water purifier. </i>

57
00:10:42,055 --> 00:10:45,821
<i>In the past, </i>
<i>they used to boil the water... </i>

58
00:10:45,892 --> 00:10:47,985
<i>for 3 to 5 minutes... </i>

59
00:10:48,061 --> 00:10:52,225
<i>to get rid of chlorine or nitrogen. </i>

60
00:10:52,298 --> 00:10:59,261
<i>The only thing is that you have to finish</i>
<i>the water in two or three days. </i>

61
00:10:59,339 --> 00:11:03,332
<i>How about the pipes? </i>
<i>The pipes... </i>

62
00:11:03,943 --> 00:11:06,468
<i>In the area of Shihlin this afternoon... </i>

63
00:11:06,546 --> 00:11:09,481
<i>a man was found</i>
<i>hiding under his bed for 8 hours. </i>

64
00:11:09,549 --> 00:11:15,044
<i>Chang Gung Hospital, </i>
<i>where he was later admitted, </i>

65
00:11:15,121 --> 00:11:18,613

<i>of this end-of-the-millennium virus, </i>

66
00:11:18,691 --> 00:11:23,890
<i>following two reported outbreaks</i>
<i>in both the Hsimen and Wanhwa areas. </i>

67
00:11:24,063 --> 00:11:26,725
<i>Panic is rising in the Shihlin area. </i>

68
00:11:26,799 --> 00:11:29,290
<i>The government</i>
<i>is watching the situation closely. </i>

69
00:11:29,369 --> 00:11:33,328
<i>More details in our midnight report. </i>

70
00:11:35,241 --> 00:11:40,008
<i>And now we'll introduce you to the fine</i>
<i>culinary art of instant noodles! </i>

71
00:11:40,079 --> 00:11:42,309
<i>Our first dish: </i>
<i>instant noodles with pickles. </i>

72
00:11:42,382 --> 00:11:44,816
<i>The ingredients are simple. </i>

73
00:11:44,884 --> 00:11:48,149
<i>Let's choose our pickles. </i>
<i>If you have Korean style pickles at home... </i>

74
00:11:48,221 --> 00:11:50,382
<i>it will be perfect. </i>

75
00:11:50,456 --> 00:11:56,224
<i>If you don't like the spicy Korean pickles, </i>
<i>Chinese pickles work just as well. </i>

76
00:11:56,295 --> 00:12:01,198
<i>Other then pickles, </i>
<i>we also need packs of instant noodles. </i>

77
00:12:01,267 --> 00:12:06,500
<i>Four packs if it's a dinner for four, </i>
<i>one if you're cooking for yourself!! </i>

78
00:12:06,572 --> 00:12:08,597
<i>What kind of noodle? </i>
<i>Any kind! </i>

79
00:12:08,674 --> 00:12:11,370
<i>It can be with bean sauce, </i>

80
00:12:11,444 --> 00:12:16,609
<i>beef, pork paste, herbs and ribs... </i>
<i>as you like it! </i>

81
00:12:16,682 --> 00:12:19,583
<i>Be it "Mi-Mi," "Wantze,"</i>
<i>or "President.”</i>

82
00:12:19,652 --> 00:12:21,552
<i>Any brand will do. </i>

83
00:12:21,621 --> 00:12:22,849
<i>Enough talk, </i>

84
00:12:22,922 --> 00:12:26,756
<i>Miss Spice Girl starts cooking now! </i>

85
00:12:26,959 --> 00:12:29,894
<i>And now we'll boil the water. </i>

86
00:12:29,962 --> 00:12:34,729
<i>I know you can manage that! </i>
<i>Get yourself a pot and just add water. </i>

87
00:12:34,801 --> 00:12:36,962
<i>As I told you before, </i>

88
00:12:37,036 --> 00:12:41,268
<i>let the water boil</i>
<i>for at least 10 minutes, </i>

89
00:12:41,340 --> 00:12:45,936
<i>or it'll give you diarrhea. </i>

90
00:12:46,012 --> 00:12:48,879
<i>We don't want that, do we? </i>

91
00:12:48,948 --> 00:12:51,974
<i>So remember</i>
<i>what Miss Spice Girl said: </i>

92
00:12:52,051 --> 00:12:54,349
<i>at least 10 minutes! </i>

93
00:12:54,420 --> 00:12:58,982
<i>Okay, pour the water into the pot. </i>
<i>That should do. </i>

94
00:12:59,058 --> 00:13:02,152
<i>That's enough</i>
<i>for one pack of noodles. </i>

95
00:13:02,328 --> 00:13:04,489
<i>A large bowl of water. </i>

96
00:13:04,564 --> 00:13:08,500
<i>Bring it to a boil for 10 minutes, </i>

97
00:13:08,568 --> 00:13:13,801
<i>and cook for 3 minutes maximum. </i>

98
00:13:13,873 --> 00:13:16,774
<i>For al dente, 2 minutes will do... </i>

99
00:13:42,335 --> 00:13:45,930
<i>Oh Calypso, Oh Calypso</i>

100
00:13:46,439 --> 00:13:49,636

<i>everyone shout hooray! </i>

106
00:14:21,941 --> 00:14:26,901
<i>I move one step forward</i>
<i>and one step back</i>

107
00:14:30,216 --> 00:14:34,983
<i>I twist and I turn</i>
<i>with endless pleasure</i>

108
00:14:38,324 --> 00:14:43,455
<i>I really don't need</i>
<i>to pour my heart out</i>

109
00:14:46,299 --> 00:14:51,737
<i>I just follow the drum</i>
<i>and find the right beat</i>

110

Can I help you, sir?

130
00:24:15,534 --> 00:24:17,468
Do you have this kind of bean sauce?

131
00:24:20,339 --> 00:24:22,273
This brand was discontinued
long time ago.

132
00:24:24,443 --> 00:24:26,673
We have the same thing but only in
different brand.

<i>You don't stand a chance</i>

151
00:32:27,425 --> 00:32:31,259
<i>'Cause you're always talking back</i>

152
00:32:31,863 --> 00:32:35,060
<i>Don't talk back</i>

153
00:32:52,617 --> 00:32:56,109
<i>Don't call me your Tiger Lady</i>

154
00:32:56,521 --> 00:33:00,013
<i>You are not the perfect hubby</i>

155
00:33:00,625 --> 00:33:04,117
<i>You're so penniless, </i>
<i>Completely useless</i>

156
00:33:04,696 --> 00:33:07,893
<i>What a nasty jealous sod, you! </i>

157
00:33:08,800 --> 00:33:11,667
<i>Go away, don't come back</i>

158
00:33:12,971 --> 00:33:16,168
<i>Come on now, take a hike</i>

159
00:33:17,309 --> 00:33:20,836
<i>You're a nuisance, </i>
<i>You don't stand a chance</i>

160
00:33:21,079 --> 00:33:24,742
<i>'Cause you're always talking back</i>

161
00:33:25,517 --> 00:33:32,685
<i>you always talk back... </i>

162
00:33:33,825 --> 00:33:37,784
<i>Talking, talking, talking, talking... </i>

163
00:33:37,862 --> 00:33:43,459
<i>I won't be your Tiger Lady no more! </i>

164
00:33:53,845 --> 00:33:55,779
Come out of there!

165
00:33:55,847 --> 00:33:59,874
Stop it, please!
You hear me?

166
00:34:01,786 --> 00:34:05,085
Get out of there.
Be a man!

167
00:34:06,091 --> 00:34:07,353
Get out now!

168
00:34:08,326 --> 00:34:10,886
Please, get out.

169
00:34:15,934 --> 00:34:17,231
What are you doing?

170
00:34:21,906 --> 00:34:25,740
Please, stop it.

171
00:34:26,077 --> 00:34:30,411
You're scaring me to death.

172
00:34:33,718 --> 00:34:38,212
Get out now, please.

173
00:35:40,285 --> 00:35:42,219
Are you the tenant of Apt. No. 804?

174
00:35:43,121 --> 00:35:44,713
I'm your downstairs neighbor.

175
00:35:44,856 --> 00:35:47,518
The plumber will come
and fix the hole this afternoon.

176
00:35:47,592 --> 00:35:49,184
Will you be home then?

177
00:35:49,961 --> 00:35:51,223
Maybe.

178
00:35:51,896 --> 00:35:53,193
You have to.

179
00:35:55,166 --> 00:35:57,566
Or else it'll never get fixed.

180
00:36:00,371 --> 00:36:02,635
What do you mean,
"It doesn't matter"?

181
00:36:04,275 --> 00:36:08,143
Do you think you're the only plumber
left alive around here?

182
00:36:12,183 --> 00:36:14,583
You think you're so damn good?

183
00:37:10,675 --> 00:37:13,143
- Did you just use the toilet?
- Why?

184
00:37:13,411 --> 00:37:16,278
Because there's a leak
above my toilet.

185
00:37:17,916 --> 00:37:19,850
Can you stop using yours?

186
00:37:20,018 --> 00:37:22,418
I'll ask the plumber to fix it.

187
00:39:08,726 --> 00:39:11,422
What are you doing here?

188
00:39:12,730 --> 00:39:14,163
Drunk again?

189
00:40:29,674 --> 00:40:31,437
What are you doing in there?

190
00:42:08,606 --> 00:42:10,699
Get a hold of him!

191
00:42:11,008 --> 00:42:13,568
Open the door.

192
00:42:14,545 --> 00:42:17,070
Just leave the stretcher here.

193
00:42:39,470 --> 00:42:41,199
<i>In the most bizarre case so far, </i>

194
00:42:41,272 --> 00:42:45,470
<i>a patient was found</i>
<i>hiding in the sewer for 6 hours. </i>

195
00:42:45,543 --> 00:42:48,273
<i>They're like roaches. </i>
<i>They fear light. </i>

196
00:42:48,346 --> 00:42:52,942
<i>A French virologist</i>
<i>from the Institute Pasteur, </i>

197
00:42:53,017 --> 00:42:54,917
<i>Dr. Carpentier, </i>

198
00:42:54,986 --> 00:42:59,150
<i>suggested that the virus be called</i>
<i>"the Taiwan Virus"...</i>

199
00:42:59,223 --> 00:43:04,183
<i>and the epidemic, </i>
<i>"Taiwan Fever. "</i>

200
00:43:04,262 --> 00:43:07,857
<i>The crisis team announced its findings</i>
<i>in a conference today. </i>

201
00:43:07,932 --> 00:43:13,097
<i>It seems that the patients</i>
<i>first develop flu-like symptoms. </i>

202
00:43:13,170 --> 00:43:15,934
<i>Days later, they develop</i>
<i>bug-like behaviors such as crawling, </i>

203
00:43:16,007 --> 00:43:20,376
<i>photophobia and a tendency to hide</i>
<i>in dark and humid corners. </i>

204
00:43:20,444 --> 00:43:24,608
<i>Experts call it</i>
<i>a "roach-like crawling. "</i>

205
00:43:24,815 --> 00:43:28,911
<i>It is suspected that the cockroach</i>
<i>is the host insect of the virus. </i>

206
00:43:34,225 --> 00:43:38,457
<i>Dr. Carpentier says the cockroach</i>
<i>is the host insect of various viruses... </i>

207
00:43:38,529 --> 00:43:40,622
<i>and a known allergic factor. </i>

208
00:43:40,698 --> 00:43:44,998
<i>Its body and excrement</i>
<i>contain a special protein. </i>

209
00:43:45,136 --> 00:43:50,699
<i>This kind of protein</i>
<i>can withstand hours of intense heat. </i>

210
00:43:56,914 --> 00:43:59,610
Sir, this place is going
to be fumigated. It's not safe.

211
00:43:59,684 --> 00:44:02,084
Please leave for now.

212
00:48:31,488 --> 00:48:33,422
<i>I... </i>

213
00:48:34,158 --> 00:48:36,058
<i>I want... </i>

214
00:48:36,560 --> 00:48:38,960

218
00:48:46,670 --> 00:48:48,729

219
00:48:49,106 --> 00:48:51,336

<i>What I want is your love</i>

223
00:48:58,916 --> 00:49:02,113
<i>So why don't you speak to me</i>

224
00:49:31,715 --> 00:49:33,808
<i>I... </i>

225
00:49:34,118 --> 00:49:36,348
<i>I want... </i>

226
00:49:36,687 --> 00:49:39,087
<i>I want you... </i>

227
00:49:39,256 --> 00:49:40,689
<i>I want you to... </i>

228
00:49:41,825 --> 00:49:43,986
<i>What I want is your love</i>

229
00:49:44,061 --> 00:49:46,859
<i>So why don't you come a bit closer? </i>

230
00:49:46,930 --> 00:49:48,989
<i>I... </i>

231
00:49:49,366 --> 00:49:51,732
<i>I want... </i>

232
00:49:51,869 --> 00:49:54,269
<i>I want you... </i>

233
00:49:54,505 --> 00:49:57,065
<i>I want you to... </i>

234
00:49:57,141 --> 00:49:59,200
<i>What I want is your love</i>

235
00:49:59,276 --> 00:50:02,643
<i>So why don't you talk to me</i>
<i>sweeter? </i>

236
00:50:41,852 --> 00:50:46,915
<i>So why don't you say</i>
<i>Oh why don't you say</i>

237
00:50:46,990 --> 00:50:52,428
<i>Why don't you say</i>
<i>that you love me? </i>

238
00:52:34,131 --> 00:52:35,723
Coconut milk?

239
00:52:37,100 --> 00:52:41,093
Where can I find any
in such foul weather?

240
00:52:51,415 --> 00:52:53,144
I want some now.

241
00:52:57,688 --> 00:52:59,918
I mean it. Now!

242
00:53:09,533 --> 00:53:11,467
What can I do?

243
00:53:16,640 --> 00:53:18,232
Stripping.

244
00:53:21,011 --> 00:53:23,241
Undressing myself.

245
00:53:26,083 --> 00:53:27,675
You want a look?

246
00:53:29,786 --> 00:53:31,515
You want a look?

247
00:53:48,772 --> 00:53:50,706
I'm lying down now.

248
00:53:56,480 --> 00:53:58,744
I'm looking at the hole
you made in the ceiling.

249
00:54:06,356 --> 00:54:08,586
There's an eye staring at me.

250
00:54:40,257 --> 00:54:44,387
Kitty.

251
00:54:47,197 --> 00:54:48,323
Kitty.

252
00:55:03,113 --> 00:55:05,581
Do you know
what a woman needs most?

253
00:55:12,522 --> 00:55:13,955
Wrong.

254
00:55:19,830 --> 00:55:21,422
Wrong again.

255
00:55:29,039 --> 00:55:30,666
Keep guessing.

256
00:55:39,416 --> 00:55:41,111
Guess again.

257
00:56:03,740 --> 00:56:05,173
And?

258
00:56:09,613 --> 00:56:11,046
I love it.

259
01:02:59,089 --> 01:03:00,750
Gesundheit!

260
01:03:02,725 --> 01:03:05,592
<i>I don't have a cold at all. </i>

261
01:03:05,662 --> 01:03:09,189
<i>And I am not</i>
<i>that Snow White's red-nosed dwarf</i>

262
01:03:09,265 --> 01:03:12,757
<i>So why then am I sneezing all day long? </i>

263
01:03:12,836 --> 01:03:14,736
<i>Something here must be wrong! </i>

264
01:03:16,973 --> 01:03:19,840
<i>Maybe some cute admirer</i>

265
01:03:19,909 --> 01:03:23,504
<i>Is calling my name over and over</i>

266
01:03:23,580 --> 01:03:27,016
<i>In secret, and I am sneezing so strong</i>

267
01:03:27,083 --> 01:03:29,017
<i>Yes, I am all day long! </i>

268
01:03:31,421 --> 01:03:34,288
<i>Last week it was Lee</i>
<i>And he was down on his knee</i>

269
01:03:34,357 --> 01:03:37,758
<i>Saying we had to marry</i>
<i>He'd spend his life pleasuring me</i>

270
01:03:37,827 --> 01:03:40,352
<i>And happy we would be! </i>

271
01:03:42,065 --> 01:03:45,091
<i>Now there is Gee</i>
<i>This one keeps bullying me</i>

272
01:03:45,168 --> 01:03:48,433
<i>He really wants to have me</i>
<i>This guy will not let me free</i>

273
01:03:48,505 --> 01:03:50,735
<i>But marriage ain't for me! </i>

274
01:03:52,842 --> 01:03:55,675
<i>It has to be them somehow</i>

275
01:03:55,745 --> 01:03:59,340
<i>Calling my name over and over now</i>

276
01:03:59,415 --> 01:04:02,782
<i>And that's why I am sneezing</i>
<i>all day long</i>

277
01:04:02,852 --> 01:04:04,752
<i>Yes, I am, all day long! </i>

278
01:04:35,718 --> 01:04:40,451
<i>Last week it was Lee</i>
<i>And he was down on his knee</i>

<i>He'd spend his life pleasuring me</i>

<i>Calling my name over and over now</i>

284
01:05:04,013 --> 01:05:07,505

<i>I am sneezing all day long</i>

285
01:05:07,584 --> 01:05:09,484
<i>Yes, I am sneezing all day long! </i>

286
01:25:09,718 --> 01:25:14,519
<i>I don't care who you are</i>

287
01:25:16,992 --> 01:25:22,089
<i>But darling, hold me close</i>

288
01:25:22,931 --> 01:25:29,336
<i>Alone together, you and me</i>

289
01:25:30,305 --> 01:25:36,710
<i>Come the days of wine and roses</i>

290
01:25:39,147 --> 01:25:43,948
<i>I don't care who you are</i>

291
01:25:46,521 --> 01:25:51,652
<i>But in your arms I cling</i>

292
01:25:52,461 --> 01:25:58,832
<i>Alone together, in the dark</i>

293
01:25:59,501 --> 01:26:05,599
<i>Come the days of carefree spring</i>

294
01:26:07,742 --> 01:26:13,510
<i>Swallows twirling in the blue skies</i>

295
01:26:15,317 --> 01:26:21,085
<i>Mandarin ducks in the quiet pond</i>

296

<i>Tell me, oh tell me why, </i>
<i>I do not know</i>

297
01:26:31,099 --> 01:26:35,729
<i>Why do they never part... </i>

298
01:27:09,538 --> 01:27:12,029
<i>In the year 2000,</i>
