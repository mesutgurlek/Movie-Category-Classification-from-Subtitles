1
00:01:19,520 --> 00:01:23,035
<i>Sunny day, blissful day,</i>
<i>hopeful heart, the motor running</i>

2
00:01:23,240 --> 00:01:26,789
<i>Laughing goal, laughing start</i>
<i>and a beautiful drive</i>

3
00:01:27,000 --> 00:01:30,436
<i>Passed Rome and Madrid,</i>
<i>a trio reeling through life</i>

4
00:01:30,640 --> 00:01:33,791
<i>Over the sea, over the land</i>
<i>we came to realise</i>

5
00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:37,515
<i>That a friend, a good friend</i>

6
00:01:37,720 --> 00:01:41,190
<i>Is the best thing in the world.</i>

7
00:01:41,400 --> 00:01:44,790
<i>A friend's always faithful</i>

8
00:01:45,040 --> 00:01:48,635
<i>Even if the whole world</i>
<i>collapses</i>

9
00:01:48,840 --> 00:01:52,594
<i>So don't get upset</i>

10
00:01:52,800 --> 00:01:56,076
<i>If your sweetheart</i>
<i>no longer loves you</i>

11
00:01:56,280 --> 00:01:59,477
<i>A friend, a good friend</i>

12
00:01:59,760 --> 00:02:03,275
<i>Is the best thing that there is</i>

13
00:02:32,760 --> 00:02:35,877
Here we are at home again.

14
00:02:37,760 --> 00:02:40,638
Do you see that? No one here
to open up for us.

15
00:02:40,840 --> 00:02:45,630
No wonder, we've come unannounced.
- And were gone 3 months.

16
00:02:45,840 --> 00:02:48,559
You can't expect the servants
to be ready.

17
00:02:48,760 --> 00:02:52,548
Pet, where is he?
- There he is.

18
00:03:02,680 --> 00:03:03,954
Where's the dreadful bird?

19
00:03:04,160 --> 00:03:07,232
What's to eat?
- Betty, where are you?

20
00:03:14,560 --> 00:03:15,913
No one here.

21
00:03:17,920 --> 00:03:20,798
What's that?
Look over here.

22
00:03:21,000 --> 00:03:22,752
What is it?

23
00:03:23,520 --> 00:03:25,511
It looks like a cuckoo.
- What's that?

24
00:03:25,720 --> 00:03:28,553
A bailiff's seal?
- A bailiff's seal?

25
00:03:28,760 --> 00:03:31,433
How did that get here?

26
00:03:32,840 --> 00:03:35,400
We're in a nice mess.
Come here.

27
00:03:37,880 --> 00:03:41,714
You are reminded of the auction
of all your distrained furniture.

28
00:03:41,920 --> 00:03:45,913
It will be fetched on June 18.
- At eleven in the morning.

29
00:03:46,120 --> 00:03:47,519
June 18, that's today.

30
00:03:47,720 --> 00:03:49,631
And it's eleven o'clock now.

31
00:03:49,920 --> 00:03:52,150
Someone's made a silly joke.

32
00:03:52,360 --> 00:03:55,238
I don't think this joke
is much to laugh about.

33
00:03:55,440 --> 00:03:57,874
Who are you calling?
- Our lawyer.

34
00:03:59,840 --> 00:04:01,353
Dr. Kalmus' office here.

35
00:04:01,560 --> 00:04:04,279
Helbing.
Can I speak to Dr. Kalmus?

36
00:04:08,720 --> 00:04:10,039
Dr. Kalmus. Who's there?

37
00:04:10,240 --> 00:04:11,753
Here's Helbing.

38
00:04:12,400 --> 00:04:14,868
The three mad musketeers
are back.

39
00:04:17,600 --> 00:04:20,239
Miss Mondschein,
what do we do now?

40
00:04:20,440 --> 00:04:22,510
Break it gently.

41
00:04:23,040 --> 00:04:25,110
Break it gently...

42
00:04:25,920 --> 00:04:27,797
Pardon, who's there?
- Helbing.

43
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:31,834
Tell me what's going on?
What a good lawyer...

44
00:04:32,040 --> 00:04:34,918
...if our home's distrained
whilst we're away?

45
00:04:35,120 --> 00:04:37,076
You should've prevented it.

46
00:04:37,280 --> 00:04:39,077
With a few words I can...

47
00:04:39,280 --> 00:04:41,077
You had our instructions...

48
00:04:41,280 --> 00:04:44,238
But for God's sake...
Stop a minute, please.

49
00:04:44,720 --> 00:04:48,349
Don't shout at me.
- No more of your cheek!

50
00:04:48,560 --> 00:04:51,279
You can't beat that!
- I won't put up with this.

51
00:04:51,480 --> 00:04:55,758
It's a misunderstanding.
I don't mean you.

52
00:04:56,360 --> 00:04:57,679
Hang it, be quiet now!

53
00:04:58,680 --> 00:05:01,274
Did he hurt you?
- Shouting at me!

54
00:05:01,760 --> 00:05:04,638
Something very unpleasant
has happened in the meantime.

55
00:05:04,880 --> 00:05:07,394
Something unpleasant? What?

56
00:05:07,600 --> 00:05:11,752
Give it to me. Something very
unpleasant? What? An earthquake?

57
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:14,639
Change of government in
Lippe-Detmold?

58
00:05:15,240 --> 00:05:17,879
Or perhaps your wife's
had a blond baby?

59
00:05:18,560 --> 00:05:21,597
Be sensible.
What... even worse.

60
00:05:21,800 --> 00:05:26,078
Gentlemen, may I have
your kind attention.

61
00:05:26,520 --> 00:05:30,479
To break it gently, you're bankrupt.
- Bankrupt?

62
00:05:32,680 --> 00:05:36,195
Yes, bankrupt. B for beggar,
A for ancient debts...

63
00:05:36,400 --> 00:05:39,472
...N for never paid,
K for kept...

64
00:05:39,680 --> 00:05:42,274
...R for really penniless,
U for utterly poor...

65
00:05:42,480 --> 00:05:46,598
...P for poverty,
and T for... touch wood.

66
00:05:46,800 --> 00:05:49,234
There's a lot of money
in our bank account.

67
00:05:49,440 --> 00:05:51,795
That's what you think.
- We only have to ring up.

68
00:05:52,000 --> 00:05:53,513
You won't get through.

69
00:05:53,720 --> 00:05:57,395
There are cells were
your banker is...

70
00:05:57,600 --> 00:05:59,318
...but not phone-boxes.

71
00:05:59,520 --> 00:06:01,590
Cells?
- Cells?

72
00:06:02,840 --> 00:06:07,118
Yes, C like credit difficulties,
E like a mess...

73
00:06:07,320 --> 00:06:09,675
...two I's like imprisoned for life.

74
00:06:10,280 --> 00:06:12,555
Imprisoned?

75
00:06:13,760 --> 00:06:15,273
Your money's gone.

76
00:06:15,480 --> 00:06:19,268
We don't own a penny?
Are completely broke?

77
00:06:20,000 --> 00:06:24,790
Broke isn't the word. Stone broke.
If I may spell it for you...

78
00:06:25,160 --> 00:06:26,798
B for...

79
00:06:27,240 --> 00:06:29,310
And the same to you.

80
00:06:30,480 --> 00:06:32,550
It seems to be out of order.

81
00:06:44,440 --> 00:06:45,873
<i>Cuckoo</i>

82
00:06:46,200 --> 00:06:49,715
<i>It calls from the wilds</i>

83
00:06:50,600 --> 00:06:54,798
<i>Dear good Bailiff</i>

84
00:06:55,040 --> 00:06:59,318
<i>Go away</i>
<i>You won't find anything here</i>

85
00:07:03,280 --> 00:07:06,670
<i>The call comes from the wilds</i>

86
00:07:17,600 --> 00:07:21,115
<i>lt'll soon be time for us</i>
<i>to stop wearing dinner jackets</i>

87
00:07:21,320 --> 00:07:24,517
<i>Oh, how shall we feel.</i>

88
00:07:25,160 --> 00:07:28,869
<i>We must forget about</i>
<i>playing polo, eating oysters</i>

89
00:07:29,080 --> 00:07:31,833
<i>Oh, how it hurts.</i>

90
00:07:32,440 --> 00:07:36,228
<i>We had goods and money,</i>
<i>and thousand things</i>

91
00:07:36,440 --> 00:07:39,796
<i>Now the beautiful life's over</i>

92
00:07:40,000 --> 00:07:42,275
<i>Instead of whiskey only lemonade</i>

93
00:07:42,480 --> 00:07:44,152
<i>Instead of caviar, marmelade</i>

94
00:07:44,360 --> 00:07:47,079
<i>Good God, we're bankrupt</i>

95
00:07:48,200 --> 00:07:49,679
<i>Cuckoo</i>

96
00:07:50,160 --> 00:07:51,593
<i>Cuckoo</i>

97
00:07:52,000 --> 00:07:54,798
<i>It calls from the woods</i>

98
00:07:55,760 --> 00:07:59,469
<i>Dear good Bailiff</i>

99
00:07:59,680 --> 00:08:03,355
<i>Go away</i>
<i>You'll find nothing here</i>

100
00:08:03,560 --> 00:08:04,709
<i>Cuckoo</i>

101
00:08:05,560 --> 00:08:06,959
<i>Cuckoo</i>

102
00:08:07,640 --> 00:08:10,438
<i>It calls back from the woods</i>

103
00:08:10,640 --> 00:08:15,589
<i>Here we are</i>
<i>Take a firm hold</i>

104
00:08:19,280 --> 00:08:25,958
<i>Use your muscles</i>
<i>Then we'll manage</i>

105
00:08:27,200 --> 00:08:31,432
<i>Look, my seal's stuck here</i>
<i>on each piece</i>

106
00:08:31,640 --> 00:08:34,916
<i>You can see it at a glance</i>

107
00:08:35,120 --> 00:08:38,396
<i>The vulture's bondsman.</i>

108
00:08:38,600 --> 00:08:42,309
<i>Dear Augustin</i>
<i>Everything, everything's gone.</i>

109
00:08:51,720 --> 00:08:53,870
<i>Good-bye, dear couch</i>

110
00:08:54,080 --> 00:08:58,073
<i>Who knows, when I'll see you again</i>

111
00:09:05,440 --> 00:09:11,675
<i>Good-bye dear silver cabinet,</i>
<i>I'll remember you all my life</i>

112
00:09:13,760 --> 00:09:15,910
<i>They're taking the carpet as well</i>

113
00:09:16,120 --> 00:09:19,749
<i>Who knows who'll walk on it</i>

114
00:09:19,960 --> 00:09:24,112
<i>They only leave the walls standing</i>

115
00:09:24,320 --> 00:09:30,555
<i>And we, we have to go</i>
<i>on the dol</i>

116
00:09:32,760 --> 00:09:36,469
<i>Sweet doing nothing, doing as we</i>
<i>please, we'll have to change</i>

117
00:09:36,680 --> 00:09:39,399
<i>Fortune's angry with us</i>

118
00:09:40,320 --> 00:09:42,515
<i>Money alone doesn't make you happy</i>

119
00:09:42,720 --> 00:09:47,157
<i>But as soon as you've got no</i>
<i>money you become nervous</i>

120
00:09:47,600 --> 00:09:50,910
<i>We only saw work from afar</i>

121
00:09:51,120 --> 00:09:54,590
<i>And even from afar</i>
<i>it didn't look nice</i>

122
00:09:54,800 --> 00:09:55,789
<i>Back!</i>

123
00:09:56,000 --> 00:09:57,399
<i>What does that mean?</i>

124
00:09:57,600 --> 00:09:58,794
<i>Oh God, he wants to bite me</i>

125
00:09:59,000 --> 00:10:00,035
<i>Get out!</i>

126
00:10:00,240 --> 00:10:02,071
<i>We're going</i>

127
00:10:02,280 --> 00:10:05,909
<i>Dear good Bailiff</i>

128
00:10:06,120 --> 00:10:09,396
<i>Go away,</i>
<i>you won't find anything here</i>

129
00:10:11,960 --> 00:10:14,520
<i>Now it's up to us</i>

130
00:10:23,320 --> 00:10:27,711
The car's the only thing
he didn't take.

131
00:10:28,280 --> 00:10:30,919
What do we know?

132
00:10:32,440 --> 00:10:33,634
Work.

133
00:10:34,600 --> 00:10:36,556
What have we learned to do?

134
00:10:37,080 --> 00:10:38,149
Tennis.

135
00:10:40,080 --> 00:10:41,832
Dancing.

136
00:10:43,040 --> 00:10:44,758
Driving.

137
00:10:45,920 --> 00:10:48,309
Something must happen.

138
00:10:49,920 --> 00:10:53,390
What's wrong?
- Not a drop of petrol.

139
00:10:53,680 --> 00:10:56,319
Then we must fill up.
- But where?

140
00:10:59,640 --> 00:11:02,313
Where?
- We'll see.

141
00:11:06,320 --> 00:11:09,437
There isn't a petrol station
far and wide.

142
00:11:13,960 --> 00:11:19,159
Unbelievable on such a busy road
where hundreds of cars drive past daily.

143
00:11:19,440 --> 00:11:21,510
Our future's ensured.

144
00:11:21,720 --> 00:11:23,551
We'll get rid of our car...

145
00:11:23,760 --> 00:11:26,479
...and set up a petrol station here
with the money.

146
00:11:26,680 --> 00:11:29,831
And we'll call the petrol
station "Cuckoo".

147
00:11:45,440 --> 00:11:48,273

<i>there is</i>

159
00:12:59,880 --> 00:13:02,713
Well and now to work.

160
00:13:13,400 --> 00:13:16,358
How have we done?
Isn't it beautiful?

161
00:13:16,560 --> 00:13:19,552
Slim as a bayadere.

162
00:13:19,960 --> 00:13:22,349
You can fatten yourself up
as well.

163
00:13:24,200 --> 00:13:25,269
Children...

164
00:13:26,400 --> 00:13:28,391
...our first customer.

165
00:13:41,800 --> 00:13:44,109
Pay attention, now, now, now.

166
00:13:52,720 --> 00:13:56,998
Here come our first earnings.

167
00:14:00,080 --> 00:14:03,470
Good day, sir.
- What can I do for you?

168
00:14:03,680 --> 00:14:06,035
What would you like?
- What can I do for you?

169
00:14:06,240 --> 00:14:07,275
Air.

170
00:14:09,480 --> 00:14:12,233
Yes, the air's good here,
we've got fantastic air.

171
00:14:12,440 --> 00:14:13,839
In the tyres!

172
00:14:14,680 --> 00:14:17,638
He's an idiot.
Anything else?

173
00:14:17,960 --> 00:14:19,473
Water.
- Pardon?

174
00:14:19,680 --> 00:14:20,874
Water.

175
00:14:21,520 --> 00:14:24,910
My God, he's thirsty.
- Water for the radiator.

176
00:14:25,440 --> 00:14:30,116
An idiot. Can't we give
you some petrol?

177
00:14:30,400 --> 00:14:32,709
Yes, a little.

178
00:14:37,920 --> 00:14:41,276
But I'd like to say
you'll break my neck.

179
00:14:42,600 --> 00:14:45,273
He even laughs, the stupid boy.

180
00:14:45,600 --> 00:14:47,352
Is the tank here or there?
- There.

181
00:14:51,000 --> 00:14:53,560
Then put some in.
- Of course.

182
00:14:53,760 --> 00:14:54,954
Enough.

183
00:14:56,440 --> 00:14:58,829
Was the gentleman satisfied
with my water?

184
00:14:59,640 --> 00:15:02,473
OK. Have a good journey.

185
00:15:08,120 --> 00:15:09,951
The air was for me.

186
00:15:10,320 --> 00:15:11,833
Another one.

187
00:15:13,920 --> 00:15:15,751
Is there another one?

188
00:15:21,040 --> 00:15:22,917
Ten pfennigs?

189
00:15:23,240 --> 00:15:24,798
Ten pfennigs.

190
00:15:25,000 --> 00:15:26,911
Our own earnings.

191
00:15:54,720 --> 00:15:58,872
Hello Willy, get up!
It's seven o'clock.

192
00:16:01,560 --> 00:16:03,391
You must get up.

193
00:16:03,600 --> 00:16:05,989
Me? Why me?

194
00:16:06,200 --> 00:16:09,397
You must go to the petrol station.
Hans will be back any moment.

195
00:16:09,600 --> 00:16:13,229
You must get up.
Today you're on duty.

196
00:16:13,600 --> 00:16:17,878
Yesterday I cooked and tidied up
and Hans the day before.

197
00:16:22,120 --> 00:16:25,078
This three shift system
makes me sick.

198
00:16:25,520 --> 00:16:28,398
You can never lie in.
- I can.

199
00:16:28,640 --> 00:16:32,076
Even when you're so tired
after eight hours...

200
00:16:32,320 --> 00:16:34,629
...working at the petrol station.

201
00:16:38,120 --> 00:16:40,270
Quick, hurry, breakfast.

202
00:16:43,320 --> 00:16:46,551
Hurry, quick, get up.
Hans needs his bed.

203
00:16:46,760 --> 00:16:50,719
Quiet, I want to eat.
- Enjoy your meal.

204
00:16:50,920 --> 00:16:54,879
Help! Murderer! Robber! Police!
- Shut up!

205
00:17:28,600 --> 00:17:29,999
Be quiet!

206
00:17:30,280 --> 00:17:33,033
You.
- Please rock me a bit more.

207
00:17:33,240 --> 00:17:35,515
How about that!

208
00:17:38,400 --> 00:17:40,755
I was sleeping so well.

209
00:17:40,960 --> 00:17:45,158
I hope you're not too angry
with me for disturbing you.

210
00:17:46,000 --> 00:17:47,831
It's great.

211
00:17:51,000 --> 00:17:55,312
What can I do for you?

212
00:17:56,560 --> 00:17:57,754
Guess.

213
00:17:57,960 --> 00:17:59,871
Wait a minute.

214
00:18:02,600 --> 00:18:07,230
I've got it! Petrol or oil.

215
00:18:09,200 --> 00:18:13,273
You're brilliant.

216
00:18:13,480 --> 00:18:16,597
What do you say now?

217
00:18:17,840 --> 00:18:19,876
Great.

218
00:18:20,080 --> 00:18:23,834
I'd like 2 litres of oil
if you can spare some.

219
00:18:24,040 --> 00:18:27,077
I can.
2 litres of oil for you anytime.

220
00:18:27,280 --> 00:18:28,952
One moment.

221
00:18:30,160 --> 00:18:31,718
Straight away.

222
00:18:31,920 --> 00:18:34,514
Thanks.
- You're welcome.

223
00:18:43,480 --> 00:18:46,040
What's that?
- For our regulars.

224
00:18:46,240 --> 00:18:49,994
Nice. Thanks.
- Don't mention it.

225
00:18:50,240 --> 00:18:53,073
Good-bye.
- Good-bye. Great.

226
00:19:01,760 --> 00:19:06,709
Great... Yes, that's
enough for today.

227
00:19:15,840 --> 00:19:18,513
<i>I'll be right back</i>

228
00:19:24,880 --> 00:19:28,953
Brilliant... great.

229
00:19:54,360 --> 00:19:56,078
Damned beast!

230
00:20:09,720 --> 00:20:11,790
Now the beast's running.

231
00:20:16,880 --> 00:20:18,632
Here's the tea.

232
00:20:19,680 --> 00:20:22,911
Milk.
- Sorry, I forgot.

233
00:20:23,720 --> 00:20:25,756
Miserable service.

234
00:20:26,720 --> 00:20:28,517
Here's the milk.

235
00:20:30,960 --> 00:20:32,598
Marmelade.

236
00:20:36,720 --> 00:20:38,711
Here's your marmelade.

237
00:20:40,400 --> 00:20:41,958
My toast!

238
00:20:47,480 --> 00:20:48,879
Old pig.

239
00:20:49,720 --> 00:20:51,392
Who's in there?

240
00:20:51,920 --> 00:20:53,433
Doesn't it taste good?

241
00:20:53,640 --> 00:20:56,200
When I think of how we ate
breakfast three months ago.

242
00:20:56,400 --> 00:21:00,837
You've no reason to complain.
The petrol station's doing well.

243
00:21:01,040 --> 00:21:04,032
The coffee's bad.
- We've got a nice house.

244
00:21:04,240 --> 00:21:07,391
The milk's burnt.
- And even bought a car.

245
00:21:08,640 --> 00:21:12,474
Don't exaggerate.
Look what a row it makes.

246
00:21:12,680 --> 00:21:14,875
It's a slow-combustion stove.

247
00:21:29,280 --> 00:21:31,555
Move - petrol station.

248
00:21:33,240 --> 00:21:33,911
What?

249
00:21:34,120 --> 00:21:36,111
A sip.
- Out of the question.

250
00:21:36,320 --> 00:21:39,949
Give it to me. Give it.
- Go to work.

251
00:21:40,800 --> 00:21:43,712
What am I? Your dog?
- No, you're lazy.

252
00:21:48,160 --> 00:21:50,594
Does it taste good?
- Wonderful.

253
00:21:51,400 --> 00:21:52,879
I made it.

254
00:22:07,440 --> 00:22:10,318
What can I do for you?
- 30 litres of petrol.

255
00:22:11,760 --> 00:22:14,752
And five litres of oil.

256
00:22:27,040 --> 00:22:28,598
Straight away.

257
00:22:36,680 --> 00:22:39,717
What can I do for you?
- Water for the radiator.

258
00:22:39,920 --> 00:22:42,992
What can I do for you?
- 20 litres of petrol.

259
00:22:43,200 --> 00:22:44,952
50 litres of petrol.

260
00:22:45,160 --> 00:22:47,435
A can of oil.

261
00:22:56,400 --> 00:22:57,833
<i>To drive a car, drive a car</i>

262
00:22:58,040 --> 00:23:02,318
<i>Is the greatest weakness</i>
<i>of every little woman</i>

263
00:23:02,520 --> 00:23:05,432
<i>And all young girls dream</i>

264
00:23:05,640 --> 00:23:07,995
<i>Today of a driving licence</i>

265
00:23:08,440 --> 00:23:12,353
<i>Super cars, classy cars,</i>
<i>with a sweet girl in it</i>

266
00:23:12,560 --> 00:23:14,278
<i>And a sky of blue</i>

267
00:23:14,480 --> 00:23:17,313
<i>Who wouldn't want to be</i>
<i>her partner</i>

268
00:23:17,520 --> 00:23:20,318
<i>And many a man calls out:</i>

269
00:23:20,680 --> 00:23:23,194
<i>Hello, you sweet lady</i>

270
00:23:23,400 --> 00:23:27,279
<i>Don't drive alone,</i>
<i>you could steer wrongly</i>

271
00:23:27,920 --> 00:23:30,798
<i>And pass by happiness</i>

272
00:23:32,680 --> 00:23:35,353
<i>Why, my sweetheart?</i>

273
00:23:35,560 --> 00:23:38,393
<i>I need all the room for myself</i>

274
00:23:38,600 --> 00:23:43,276
<i>Take me with you, I know</i>
<i>the way there and back</i>

275
00:23:45,320 --> 00:23:50,952
<i>If the right man's at the wheel</i>

276
00:23:51,160 --> 00:23:56,439
<i>He'll lead you to adventure</i>

277
00:23:56,960 --> 00:24:02,592
<i>Hello, you sweet lady,</i>
<i>don't drive alone, take me along</i>

278
00:24:02,800 --> 00:24:07,112
<i>I know the way to paradise</i>

279
00:24:47,760 --> 00:24:50,228
<i>Why, my dear one</i>

280
00:24:50,440 --> 00:24:53,318
<i>Do you need all the room</i>
<i>for yourself?</i>

281
00:24:53,520 --> 00:24:58,071
<i>Take me with you, I'll find</i>
<i>the way there and back</i>

282
00:25:10,760 --> 00:25:15,959
<i>Hello, you super woman,</i>
<i>don't drive alone, take me with you</i>

283
00:25:16,160 --> 00:25:20,358
<i>I know the way to paradise</i>

284
00:25:40,320 --> 00:25:42,117
<i>We forgot that!</i>

285
00:25:46,120 --> 00:25:52,275
<i>If in spring you don't drive</i>
<i>in company</i>

286
00:25:52,480 --> 00:25:58,316
<i>We'll be lonely in the nicest car</i>

287
00:25:58,520 --> 00:26:03,036
<i>Hello, you sweet lady,</i>
<i>don't drive alone</i>

288
00:26:03,240 --> 00:26:05,276
<i>Take me with you,</i>

00:26:05,480 --> 00:26:10,713
<i>I know the way to paradise</i>

290
00:26:17,560 --> 00:26:18,709
Yes, Dr. Lutter?

291
00:26:18,920 --> 00:26:21,036
I'd like to speak to Consul
Cossmann.

292
00:26:21,240 --> 00:26:24,118
The Consul's busy.

293
00:26:25,680 --> 00:26:28,035
Hello, miss!
- Yes?

294
00:26:29,040 --> 00:26:32,874
The Consul mustn't be disturbed.
- Then that's it.

295
00:26:34,400 --> 00:26:38,916
I can't put you through to the Consul,
he's got an urgent discussion.

296
00:26:40,760 --> 00:26:44,548
I told you that
the Consul's engaged.

297
00:26:50,960 --> 00:26:54,270
You know exactly that the wedding
doesn't depend on me.

298
00:26:54,480 --> 00:26:57,119
You'd have been
my wife for ages...

299
00:26:57,320 --> 00:27:00,517
...if my daughter weren't
so strict with me.

300
00:27:00,720 --> 00:27:04,633
Have you spoken to her at all?
- What an idea?!

301
00:27:04,960 --> 00:27:08,714
Then I'll speak to her.
- But Edith...

302
00:27:10,120 --> 00:27:11,792
Good day, Mops.

303
00:27:14,840 --> 00:27:19,072
I've asked you a thousand times
not to call me Mops.

304
00:27:19,360 --> 00:27:22,318
But Mop suits you.

305
00:27:23,640 --> 00:27:26,438
I'm pleased to meet you at last.

306
00:27:26,880 --> 00:27:29,235
Your father told me so much
about you.

307
00:27:29,440 --> 00:27:32,557
He told me less about you.

308
00:27:32,760 --> 00:27:37,276
You've come just right.
I was telling your father...

309
00:27:37,480 --> 00:27:40,836
...that I'd like to speak to you
in private.

310
00:27:41,040 --> 00:27:43,395
That's not at all necessary.

311
00:27:43,600 --> 00:27:47,593
You can go into the conference room
in the meantime.

312
00:27:47,800 --> 00:27:50,473
Go, march, march.
- But Lilian, but Edith...

313
00:27:54,680 --> 00:27:57,911
Here, so you don't get
bored, Mopsi.

314
00:28:01,480 --> 00:28:04,756
Well.
- Thanks, I'll be brief.

315
00:28:05,000 --> 00:28:09,790
Miss Lilian, I'd like to ask you
for your father's hand.

316
00:28:13,000 --> 00:28:18,597
Madam, you do us an honour
but I regret to have to inform you...

317
00:28:18,800 --> 00:28:23,351
...that my father's temperament
requires a firm hand...

318
00:28:23,560 --> 00:28:26,472
...which you unfortunately don't have.

319
00:28:27,560 --> 00:28:31,872
I must, therefore, keep him
under my control for now.

320
00:28:33,720 --> 00:28:36,757
I knew it.
I knew it!

321
00:28:38,760 --> 00:28:41,433
You can come back in again.

322
00:28:42,920 --> 00:28:44,399
But you can't...

323
00:28:44,640 --> 00:28:47,791
Give me 200 marks instead
and don't talk so much.

324
00:28:48,000 --> 00:28:50,116
Why 200 marks again?

325
00:28:50,320 --> 00:28:52,914
I must go to the cinema
and buy myself cigarettes.

326
00:28:53,120 --> 00:28:56,032
Well in that case... here.
- Thanks. Good-bye, Mops.

327
00:29:05,040 --> 00:29:07,713
A splendid girl.
- Isn't she?

328
00:29:08,800 --> 00:29:12,270
If only she wouldn't call me Mops.

329
00:29:27,120 --> 00:29:28,519
Maestro.

330
00:29:28,720 --> 00:29:33,840
What's the matter? Why are
you shining your lights on me?

331
00:29:34,280 --> 00:29:37,556
Sorry, I thought
you were someone else.

332
00:29:41,680 --> 00:29:43,875
What can I do for you?

333
00:29:44,200 --> 00:29:46,555
There must be something
wrong with my car.

334
00:29:46,760 --> 00:29:50,719
I filled up this afternoon,
now the petrol's all gone.

335
00:29:50,920 --> 00:29:53,195
We'll soon have that.
One moment.

336
00:29:55,680 --> 00:29:59,639
No wonder, you're driving
without a petrol cap.

337
00:29:59,880 --> 00:30:03,156
So much for women drivers.

338
00:30:04,400 --> 00:30:06,675
I bet I can drive
better than you.

339
00:30:06,880 --> 00:30:09,838
Possible. But now I'll get
you a new petrol cap.

340
00:30:10,040 --> 00:30:13,589
Take your time,
I'm not in a hurry.

341
00:30:29,760 --> 00:30:32,877
That's too big.
- You see everything.

342
00:30:35,200 --> 00:30:39,432
This one's too small.
- Then wrap something around it.

343
00:30:40,640 --> 00:30:44,315
No, that would be a pity.
- You can bring it back sometime.

344
00:30:44,560 --> 00:30:46,994
Yes, gladly.
What are your working hours?

345
00:30:47,200 --> 00:30:51,193
If I'm not here give it to one
of my colleagues.

346
00:30:51,400 --> 00:30:55,598
Are your colleagues
all as nice as you?

347
00:30:59,800 --> 00:31:05,079
This doll is to remind you to
keep your car in good shape.

348
00:31:08,160 --> 00:31:11,232
What's that for?
- For your trouble.

349
00:31:12,840 --> 00:31:14,751
I didn't mean to insult you.

350
00:31:14,960 --> 00:31:20,398
If you want to make amends tell me
your phone number and name.

351
00:31:21,000 --> 00:31:22,752
You're quite mad.

352
00:31:22,960 --> 00:31:24,791
Oh, please, please.

353
00:31:43,400 --> 00:31:47,234
Lilian Cossmann,
Breitenbach 1387.

354
00:31:57,000 --> 00:32:03,712
<i>I know the way to paradise</i>

355
00:32:20,680 --> 00:32:22,830
What have you got there?

356
00:32:23,560 --> 00:32:25,391
Oh, nothing.

357
00:32:34,440 --> 00:32:36,954
What are you mumbling about?

358
00:32:37,840 --> 00:32:39,671
Oh, nothing.

359
00:33:04,760 --> 00:33:07,194
Good evening, little one.

360
00:33:09,600 --> 00:33:11,238
What have you got there?

361
00:33:11,440 --> 00:33:14,830
Mops, I've met three
charming young men...

362
00:33:15,040 --> 00:33:19,955
...three friends and none of them
knows that I know the others.

363
00:33:20,160 --> 00:33:23,948
You're a good one. You're so
strict with me whereas you have...

364
00:33:24,160 --> 00:33:30,998
I've been thinking all evening
which of the three is the nicest.

365
00:33:54,120 --> 00:33:55,235
Where are these people?

366
00:33:55,440 --> 00:33:59,399
I don't know.
I've been waiting an hour.

367
00:33:59,600 --> 00:34:03,479
I can't wait that long.
- Stay, they must be here soon.

368
00:34:03,680 --> 00:34:06,319
Why?
- Can't you read?

369
00:34:06,520 --> 00:34:10,195
<i>Back in a moment</i>

370
00:34:10,480 --> 00:34:13,756
Give me the parcel.
- No, it belongs to me.

371
00:34:13,960 --> 00:34:18,670
I want to see what you're doing
with our hard-earned money.

372
00:34:23,080 --> 00:34:27,596
Pure silk, silk. Wraps himself
in silk like an old geisha...

373
00:34:27,800 --> 00:34:30,758
...so that he can please his
secret love.

374
00:34:30,960 --> 00:34:34,157
Cheek. I don't ask who you
bath in lavender for.

375
00:34:34,360 --> 00:34:37,193
You've got a smell that even
a dog couldn't stand.

376
00:34:37,400 --> 00:34:40,153
I smell quite all right.
I smell very nice.

377
00:34:40,360 --> 00:34:43,432
And who am I bathing for
if you know it already?

378
00:34:43,640 --> 00:34:45,790
For this impossible person.

379
00:34:46,000 --> 00:34:49,595
What did you say? Lmpossible...
Which impossible person?

380
00:34:49,800 --> 00:34:54,510
What sort of a girl would
have anything to do with you?

381
00:34:55,040 --> 00:34:59,556
Better than the female that hangs
a sardine tin round your neck.

382
00:34:59,760 --> 00:35:01,478
Where is it?
Show me.

383
00:35:01,680 --> 00:35:05,593
What did you say,
you ridiculous dwarf?

384
00:35:05,800 --> 00:35:07,791
Female?

385
00:35:11,320 --> 00:35:13,550
Help!

386
00:35:14,760 --> 00:35:16,079
Leave my friend alone.

387
00:35:16,280 --> 00:35:20,239
If you touch me, I'll spit
at you. Willy, help!

388
00:35:20,440 --> 00:35:23,034
What's the matter?
- Nothing to do with you.

389
00:35:23,240 --> 00:35:26,118
What are you doing here? You
should be at the petrol station.

390
00:35:26,320 --> 00:35:28,470
Me? You! Or Hans
- Me?

391
00:35:28,680 --> 00:35:32,719
Are you mad? I'm not going to
get consumption and you laze about.

392
00:35:32,920 --> 00:35:34,911
A filthy mess.
- Don't be ridiculous.

393
00:35:35,120 --> 00:35:38,430
I'm not as ridiculous as you.
Mysterious stranger.

394
00:35:38,640 --> 00:35:40,198
Have you introduced
your girl to me?

395
00:35:40,400 --> 00:35:44,188
My girl's a lady who musn't
be compromised.

396
00:35:44,520 --> 00:35:48,991
You're hiding her because
you're afraid we'll take her away.

397
00:35:52,200 --> 00:35:53,553
Just wait!

398
00:36:01,320 --> 00:36:04,710
That's fine, just hit each other,
I'll be the referee.

399
00:36:51,880 --> 00:36:56,271
Give him a hand, I've got to
go to the petrol station.

400
00:36:56,960 --> 00:36:59,155
That's a mess.

401
00:37:00,680 --> 00:37:04,673
A mess! Now we'll break
the door down!

402
00:38:09,480 --> 00:38:11,596
Damned awful weather!

403
00:38:17,640 --> 00:38:20,359
Lilian! You here?

404
00:38:21,000 --> 00:38:25,312
The storm took me by surprise.
What a sight you are!

405
00:38:25,520 --> 00:38:28,114
The storm also took me by surprise.

406
00:38:28,320 --> 00:38:31,630
And besides,
I had a bit of a fight.

407
00:38:32,120 --> 00:38:33,599
Aren't you ashamed of yourself?

408
00:38:33,800 --> 00:38:38,430
What else can I do when a
lady dear to me is insulted?

409
00:38:39,680 --> 00:38:41,875
A lady dear to you?

410
00:38:42,400 --> 00:38:47,030
That's exaggerating.
A friend, a casual friend.

411
00:38:57,960 --> 00:39:03,671
Tell me, Willy, if someone
insulted me would you fight for me?

412
00:39:03,880 --> 00:39:06,314
Of course
- That's nice.

413
00:39:06,520 --> 00:39:10,308
I mean to say I'd do it for
any other lady.

414
00:39:15,200 --> 00:39:18,033
You think you're irresistable,
don't you?

415
00:39:18,240 --> 00:39:22,472
No, not irresistable,
but clever enough...

416
00:39:22,680 --> 00:39:26,116
...to realise that you're rude
to me because...

417
00:39:26,320 --> 00:39:30,108
...you're afraid of being as kind
to me as you'd like to be.

418
00:39:40,720 --> 00:39:44,793
How do you know that I want
to be kind to you?

419
00:39:45,000 --> 00:39:47,639
I hear it. There.

420
00:39:49,960 --> 00:39:56,672
<i>Darling, my heart greets you</i>

421
00:39:56,880 --> 00:40:00,316
<i>Only with you alone</i>

422
00:40:00,520 --> 00:40:04,274
<i>Can it be happy</i>

423
00:40:05,280 --> 00:40:11,628
<i>All my sweet dreams</i>

424
00:40:11,840 --> 00:40:18,279
<i>Are wrapped in my greeting</i>

425
00:40:20,640 --> 00:40:27,318
<i>Don't let the days fly past</i>

426
00:40:28,320 --> 00:40:33,599
<i>Spring is nearly over</i>

427
00:40:36,040 --> 00:40:43,276
<i>Darling, my heart greets you</i>

428
00:40:43,480 --> 00:40:50,318
<i>And tells you how much I love you</i>

429
00:40:57,840 --> 00:41:04,473
<i>Still only sympathy entwines us</i>

430
00:41:04,840 --> 00:41:08,833
<i>We are still formal</i>

431
00:41:09,040 --> 00:41:13,113
<i>We've never kissed</i>

432
00:41:13,960 --> 00:41:17,157
<i>But in my dreams</i>

433
00:41:17,360 --> 00:41:20,432
<i>I use your first name</i>

434
00:41:20,640 --> 00:41:26,590
<i>And whisper softly to you...</i>

435
00:41:31,040 --> 00:41:37,991
<i>Darling, my heart greets you</i>

436
00:41:38,200 --> 00:41:41,715
<i>Only with you alone</i>

437
00:41:41,920 --> 00:41:45,799
<i>Can it be happy</i>

438
00:41:46,680 --> 00:41:53,552
<i>All my sweet dreams</i>

439
00:41:53,760 --> 00:42:00,108
<i>Are wrapped in the greeting</i>

440
00:42:02,440 --> 00:42:09,676
<i>Don't let the days fly past</i>

441
00:42:10,280 --> 00:42:15,070
<i>Spring is nearly over</i>

442
00:42:17,800 --> 00:42:25,309
<i>Darling, my heart greets you</i>

443
00:42:26,120 --> 00:42:33,913
<i>And tells you how much I love you</i>

444
00:43:52,840 --> 00:43:55,400
<i>An eye</i>

445
00:43:56,280 --> 00:43:58,953
<i>A black eye</i>

446
00:44:00,640 --> 00:44:07,910
<i>Is the worst thing in the world</i>

447
00:44:08,680 --> 00:44:13,879
<i>A cloth, a damp cloth</i>

448
00:44:14,080 --> 00:44:19,234
<i>Is always good if you</i>
<i>hold it against it</i>

449
00:44:19,440 --> 00:44:23,319
<i>My child, do not be upset</i>

450
00:44:23,520 --> 00:44:26,671
<i>If there's no wedding</i>

451
00:44:26,880 --> 00:44:30,156
<i>A friend, a good friend</i>

452
00:44:30,360 --> 00:44:33,511
<i>Is the greatest treasure</i>
<i>that there is</i>

453
00:44:33,720 --> 00:44:37,349
Stop! I know the chorus,
dear friend.

454
00:44:37,560 --> 00:44:40,199
It comes after every verse
you utter.

455
00:44:40,400 --> 00:44:45,269
Edith, I'd like to...
Lilian's come.

456
00:44:46,200 --> 00:44:48,634
Your strict guardian.

457
00:45:59,720 --> 00:46:01,073
Allow me?

458
00:46:05,560 --> 00:46:09,473
Thank you, madam.
- For the first time you're nice to me.

459
00:46:09,680 --> 00:46:11,955
You've picked a lucky day.

460
00:46:12,160 --> 00:46:15,470
A lucky day? I bet there's
a man behind this.

461
00:46:15,680 --> 00:46:18,513
If only it were so simple!
There are two men involved.

462
00:46:18,720 --> 00:46:22,508
Two men?
- To tell the truth three.

463
00:46:22,720 --> 00:46:26,793
With all respect! You must
tell me about it. Come.

464
00:46:28,400 --> 00:46:31,153
Of course only one can
seriously be considered.

465
00:46:34,120 --> 00:46:37,237
You must make your choice.

466
00:46:37,440 --> 00:46:38,919
You think so?

467
00:46:39,280 --> 00:46:42,750
You can deceive one man.
You even have to.

468
00:46:42,960 --> 00:46:46,953
But three men together are
as clever as one woman.

469
00:46:47,160 --> 00:46:49,913
Then I must tell the truth.

470
00:46:50,120 --> 00:46:52,554
But diplomatically.

471
00:46:52,920 --> 00:46:56,799
Then the best thing is to
write each one a letter.

472
00:46:57,200 --> 00:46:58,997
It's not as simple as that.

473
00:46:59,680 --> 00:47:03,036
Why?
I'll just write:

474
00:47:03,240 --> 00:47:08,951
My dear Willy, I...

475
00:47:10,880 --> 00:47:13,917
Yes, what shall I write...

476
00:47:14,120 --> 00:47:17,954
...so that he doesn't misunderstand?
I...

477
00:47:19,280 --> 00:47:21,510
I never thought
it'd be so difficult...

478
00:47:21,720 --> 00:47:24,439
...to write letters diplomatically
telling the truth.

479
00:47:24,640 --> 00:47:26,710
I told you so.

480
00:47:27,200 --> 00:47:30,158
<i>Objectively a letter</i>

481
00:47:30,360 --> 00:47:34,148
<i>Can be very awkward</i>

482
00:47:34,840 --> 00:47:41,598
<i>Many a person looks at it</i>
<i>and reads behind the lines</i>

483
00:47:41,800 --> 00:47:44,951
<i>Be careful how you do it</i>

484
00:47:45,200 --> 00:47:48,476
<i>So that it's understood</i>

485
00:47:48,680 --> 00:47:52,150
<i>What you mean</i>

486
00:47:52,360 --> 00:47:55,636
<i>By each line</i>

487
00:47:55,840 --> 00:48:03,315
<i>First a large question mark</i>

488
00:48:03,920 --> 00:48:06,388
<i>Which means:</i>

489
00:48:06,600 --> 00:48:10,673
<i>When will you give in?</i>

490
00:48:10,880 --> 00:48:13,633
<i>Then comes...</i>

491
00:48:13,840 --> 00:48:17,196
<i>A dash</i>

492
00:48:18,240 --> 00:48:24,759
<i>Which means:</i>
<i>Darling, I love you</i>

493
00:48:24,960 --> 00:48:31,718
<i>Then from time to time</i>
<i>whilst kissing</i>

494
00:48:31,920 --> 00:48:39,076
<i>You'll have to put in a comma</i>

495
00:48:40,680 --> 00:48:47,392
<i>And finally a full-stop</i>

496
00:48:49,640 --> 00:48:57,593
<i>Which means: Leave me alone</i>

497
00:49:01,560 --> 00:49:04,552
No, I can't do it like that.

498
00:49:06,200 --> 00:49:08,998
I'd better tell all three.

499
00:49:09,200 --> 00:49:13,239
That won't be easy,
I don't want to hurt any of them.

500
00:49:13,440 --> 00:49:15,635
Then we'll anesthetize
patient beforehand.

501
00:49:15,840 --> 00:49:17,558
How?
- With champagne.

502
00:49:17,760 --> 00:49:21,594
Tell all three to come to the
Gigepfel at 10 tomorrow evening.

503
00:49:21,800 --> 00:49:25,679
There they'll all see that
they're in love with the same girl.

504
00:49:25,880 --> 00:49:30,351
You're clever and charming,
pity I didn't know that before.

505
00:51:05,960 --> 00:51:08,076
Where are you going?

506
00:51:08,280 --> 00:51:10,077
I've got a date.

507
00:51:10,280 --> 00:51:13,317
You too? That's... very good.

508
00:51:20,240 --> 00:51:23,516
What's going on?
Is this a fashion show?

509
00:51:23,720 --> 00:51:27,030
We've got a date.

510
00:51:27,240 --> 00:51:31,313
And the petrol station?
One of you is on duty.

511
00:51:42,520 --> 00:51:45,830
Would you like to take over
for me?

512
00:51:46,040 --> 00:51:49,271
I've got a date.
- Leave me alone.

513
00:51:52,120 --> 00:51:56,716
Would you like take over my duty?
I've got a date.

514
00:51:56,920 --> 00:51:59,434
Why should I?

515
00:52:00,040 --> 00:52:03,157
Besides, with your permission...

516
00:52:03,360 --> 00:52:06,875
...I also have something special
on this evening.

517
00:52:07,080 --> 00:52:10,356
Well, one of you has to go
to the petrol station.

518
00:52:10,560 --> 00:52:11,913
Why me?

519
00:52:12,120 --> 00:52:16,910
Why always me? It's a cheek
if no one does one a favour.

520
00:52:17,120 --> 00:52:19,076
What cheek!

521
00:52:19,640 --> 00:52:23,076
I know. We'll draw lots for
who's on duty.

522
00:52:23,280 --> 00:52:24,952
Yes, but without me.

523
00:52:25,160 --> 00:52:28,550
I wouldn't dream of it.
What then?

524
00:52:36,480 --> 00:52:42,510
Yes, why not draw lots?
Willy, don't be a spoilsport.

525
00:52:43,000 --> 00:52:44,433
What for? Why?

526
00:52:44,640 --> 00:52:47,837
Go on.
- Well, I don't mind.

527
00:52:48,920 --> 00:52:51,229
Here are three bits a paper.

528
00:52:52,440 --> 00:52:54,158
There's a nought on one.

529
00:52:54,400 --> 00:52:57,551
Whoever draws the nought's
on duty.

530
00:53:00,760 --> 00:53:03,194
Willy, you start.
- Good, I'll start.

531
00:53:04,920 --> 00:53:06,717
My God, the nought.

532
00:53:06,920 --> 00:53:09,229
The nought. Bad luck.

533
00:53:09,440 --> 00:53:12,796
Poor chap.
- Shall we go?

534
00:53:21,360 --> 00:53:23,555
Oh, go to the devil.

535
00:53:29,120 --> 00:53:32,078
We pulled a fast one on him.

536
00:53:32,320 --> 00:53:34,390
We did a good job.

537
00:53:40,120 --> 00:53:43,237
Well, where exactly is
your rendezvous?

538
00:53:43,440 --> 00:53:47,797
Oh, I've completely forgotten.
- Well, well.

539
00:53:55,320 --> 00:53:59,438
And you,
where's your rendezvous?

540
00:53:59,920 --> 00:54:02,718
I've completely forgotten.

541
00:54:09,920 --> 00:54:12,309
Quick, quick!
It's urgent.

542
00:54:21,480 --> 00:54:25,837
Suspicious scoundrel!

543
00:55:12,640 --> 00:55:14,676
These rascals!

544
00:56:36,080 --> 00:56:37,718
Nice, isn't it?

545
00:56:42,720 --> 00:56:44,676
I'm a bit afraid.

546
00:56:44,880 --> 00:56:48,509
A drink'll give you courage.
- Yes, you're right.

547
00:56:49,480 --> 00:56:53,075
Tell me, what have you been
whispering about all evening?

548
00:56:53,280 --> 00:56:57,273
Nothing for small children.
- And nothing for large Mops.

549
00:57:35,200 --> 00:57:37,998
Give me a drink.

550
00:57:38,200 --> 00:57:40,668
Yes, right away.

551
00:57:49,480 --> 00:57:51,277
There they are.

552
00:57:52,720 --> 00:57:54,119
Now.

553
00:57:59,840 --> 00:58:03,310
Gin, please.
- A cherry cola, please.

554
00:58:18,720 --> 00:58:23,510
That's fantastic.
- Yes, that worked. Cognac.

555
00:58:23,720 --> 00:58:24,755
Cocktail.

556
00:58:24,960 --> 00:58:29,476
Now, my friend, you'll see
how pretty my girl is.

557
00:58:29,880 --> 00:58:31,632
Cheers.
- Cheers.

558
00:58:35,160 --> 00:58:38,357
Yours won't even exist
when you see mine.

559
00:58:38,560 --> 00:58:40,232
We'll see.

560
00:58:45,000 --> 00:58:49,471
Shall we bet that mine's prettier?
- You're crazy.

561
00:58:54,920 --> 00:58:57,195
Good evening, gentlemen.

562
00:59:02,080 --> 00:59:03,308
May I introduce...

563
00:59:03,520 --> 00:59:07,752
I've won my bet.
She's my rendezvous.

564
00:59:07,960 --> 00:59:10,030
Yours? She's mine.

565
00:59:10,240 --> 00:59:14,916
Lilian, please tell this incorrigible
bragger with whom you've got a date.

566
00:59:15,120 --> 00:59:18,351
Yes, please,
tell this notorious boaster...

567
00:59:18,560 --> 00:59:21,757
Yes, gentlemen, I'll explain
everything to you, but...

568
00:59:21,960 --> 00:59:26,750
...for the moment I've got a date
with each of you.

569
00:59:28,200 --> 00:59:30,191
With both of us?

570
00:59:30,960 --> 00:59:33,713
With both of us?
- Not so loud!

571
00:59:33,920 --> 00:59:35,558
I must say...

572
00:59:35,760 --> 00:59:37,637
Look, Hans...
- No, I'm not interested.

573
00:59:37,840 --> 00:59:40,354
Please, Kurt, I can...
- I'd rather do without.

574
00:59:40,560 --> 00:59:43,472
I never thought much of you,
you fool, but to be so mean!

575
00:59:43,680 --> 00:59:46,319
If I'd known with whom
I was hand in glove...

576
00:59:46,520 --> 00:59:50,229
...living under one
and the same roof...

577
00:59:50,600 --> 00:59:53,398
Don't be so angry,
it's all my fault.

578
00:59:53,600 --> 00:59:56,194
You lied to us.
- And betrayed us.

579
00:59:56,400 --> 00:59:58,356
Played with us.
- Leered from one to the other.

580
00:59:58,560 --> 01:00:00,516
Laughed at us.
- Made us look ridiculous.

581
01:00:00,720 --> 01:00:02,711
She's also got a rendezvous
with Willy.

582
01:00:02,920 --> 01:00:05,480
I'd credit the lady with anything.

583
01:00:06,440 --> 01:00:08,192
In your place I'd be ashamed.

584
01:00:08,400 --> 01:00:11,198
In you place I'd behave
myself decently.

585
01:00:12,720 --> 01:00:14,631
Him as well?!

586
01:00:18,160 --> 01:00:20,674
May I take you to your table?

587
01:00:30,720 --> 01:00:33,109
You dressed yourself
in silk for that!

588
01:00:33,320 --> 01:00:35,834
And you bathed in lavender.

589
01:00:37,840 --> 01:00:40,798
A cognac, a large one.

590
01:00:41,360 --> 01:00:43,954
Soda, a lot.

591
01:00:51,560 --> 01:00:53,596
That was nice of you.

592
01:01:34,280 --> 01:01:37,477
Lilian, child, where have
you been so long?

593
01:01:37,680 --> 01:01:42,117
Papa, I'd like to introduce
Mr. Willy Helbing, my Papa.

594
01:01:42,320 --> 01:01:45,312
It's a pleasure to meet you.
- My pleasure.

595
01:01:45,520 --> 01:01:48,114
I've got several things to say.

596
01:01:48,440 --> 01:01:51,796
Mops, before he speaks to you,
you have to know...

597
01:01:52,000 --> 01:01:55,515
...that he's the nicest young man
that I know.

598
01:01:57,200 --> 01:01:59,555
Well, young friend?

599
01:01:59,960 --> 01:02:02,235
Don't be offended, Consul...

600
01:02:02,440 --> 01:02:04,908
...your family affairs are no
concern of mine...

601
01:02:05,120 --> 01:02:08,795
...but I'd advise you to bring up
your daughter better.

602
01:02:10,840 --> 01:02:14,833
You needn't give up hope that she'll
become a useful person one day.

603
01:02:15,040 --> 01:02:19,511
At the moment she's a heartless,
superficial, coquettish, spoilt brat.

604
01:02:21,080 --> 01:02:22,638
Good evening, Consul.

605
01:02:27,920 --> 01:02:30,957
He's put you in your place.
By Jove!

606
01:02:31,160 --> 01:02:34,072
That'd be a son-in-law for me.

607
01:02:35,760 --> 01:02:36,795
Come.

608
01:02:49,960 --> 01:02:52,793
Willy's coming. Look, it's Willy.

609
01:02:53,000 --> 01:02:56,276
Here he comes. Look, Willy!

610
01:02:59,320 --> 01:03:02,153
Well, where's your heart's desire?

611
01:03:02,360 --> 01:03:04,999
Yes, where's your darling?

612
01:03:06,000 --> 01:03:08,195
You should be ashamed.

613
01:03:09,040 --> 01:03:10,871
You fools.

614
01:03:14,640 --> 01:03:17,871
Are you putting up with his?

615
01:03:20,480 --> 01:03:22,072
Filthy dog.

616
01:03:26,560 --> 01:03:29,074
<i>A friend</i>

617
01:03:30,280 --> 01:03:33,272
<i>A good friend</i>

618
01:03:33,680 --> 01:03:38,993
<i>Is the greatest treasure</i>
<i>that there is</i>

619
01:03:39,200 --> 01:03:41,111
Oh, he's a nice fellow.

620
01:03:43,680 --> 01:03:47,434
You got me into this.
You with your diplomacy.

621
01:03:47,640 --> 01:03:48,914
But Lilian...

622
01:03:49,120 --> 01:03:52,317
It's all your fault.
Yes, now I know. Yes.

623
01:03:52,520 --> 01:03:56,672
When you have only one daughter,
you take care of her...

624
01:03:56,880 --> 01:04:00,759
...and don't let her flirt with
three men at the same time.

625
01:04:00,960 --> 01:04:04,873
Three? Why three men?
- Oh, that's my affair.

626
01:04:05,280 --> 01:04:06,838
I don't understand.

627
01:04:07,240 --> 01:04:11,438
What kind of advice did you give her?
- That's my affair.

628
01:04:12,160 --> 01:04:17,154
Will you pay so that we can go?
- Pay, that's my affair...

629
01:04:19,520 --> 01:04:21,112
But children...

630
01:04:43,720 --> 01:04:51,229
<i>Darling, my heart greets you</i>

631
01:04:52,320 --> 01:05:00,273
<i>It can only be happy</i>
<i>with you alone</i>

632
01:05:03,160 --> 01:05:10,840
<i>All my sweet dreams</i>

633
01:05:11,320 --> 01:05:18,715
<i>Are wrapped in the greeting</i>

634
01:05:41,120 --> 01:05:48,356
<i>Darling, my heart greets you</i>

635
01:05:50,480 --> 01:06:00,594
<i>And tells you</i>
<i>how much I love you.</i>

636
01:06:24,520 --> 01:06:26,670
<i>Shut</i>
<i>For sale</i>

637
01:06:27,120 --> 01:06:28,348
Well...

638
01:06:39,560 --> 01:06:40,959
Please...

639
01:06:44,000 --> 01:06:46,958
Good day, miss, it's good
of you to come to me...

640
01:06:47,160 --> 01:06:50,072
...I didn't have time,
after the recess there's a lot to do.

641
01:06:50,280 --> 01:06:52,191
Consul, please be seated.

642
01:06:56,800 --> 01:07:01,191
Ladies and gentlemen,
I herewith open today's meeting.

643
01:07:15,680 --> 01:07:17,989
You can leave.
- Me? Why me?

644
01:07:18,200 --> 01:07:21,715
Because it's a private matter.
- I'm your private secretary.

645
01:07:21,920 --> 01:07:26,038
You were if you don't go at once
and close the door.

646
01:07:26,880 --> 01:07:28,029
Excuse me.

647
01:07:28,720 --> 01:07:32,030
Ladies and gentlemen,
I open today's meeting.

648
01:07:32,240 --> 01:07:33,958
For the second time?

649
01:07:34,160 --> 01:07:38,199
Which has been called to
discuss the arrangements...

650
01:07:38,400 --> 01:07:40,994
...which shall lead to a marriage...

651
01:07:41,200 --> 01:07:44,158
...between Miss Lilian Cossmann
and the one hand - charming -

652
01:07:44,360 --> 01:07:47,397
...and Willy Helbing on the other.

653
01:07:47,600 --> 01:07:49,989
I beg to speak.
- Please.

654
01:07:55,360 --> 01:07:58,670
<i>To let</i>

655
01:08:28,720 --> 01:08:33,635
You're decent and fall in love
with one woman...

656
01:08:34,040 --> 01:08:38,238
...and such a little beast falls in love
with three men.

657
01:08:39,680 --> 01:08:43,468
You live unaware with two people
you took for your friends...

658
01:08:43,680 --> 01:08:49,312
...who turn out to be rascals
with whom it's impossible to live.

659
01:08:51,440 --> 01:08:53,271
Then we all agree.
- That's it.

660
01:08:54,160 --> 01:08:57,470
Each of us goes his own way.
- Exactly my opinion.

661
01:09:05,080 --> 01:09:06,354
Come in.

662
01:09:07,800 --> 01:09:11,918
Good day. Do the three men
from the garage live here?

663
01:09:13,200 --> 01:09:16,715
I've brought a lady here
who'd like to speak to the gentlemen.

664
01:09:16,920 --> 01:09:18,990
A lady?

665
01:09:20,960 --> 01:09:23,952
I'm not in.
- Nothing doing.

666
01:09:24,160 --> 01:09:27,277
I very much regret...
- That would make me very sorry.

667
01:09:29,440 --> 01:09:31,396
Good day, gentlemen.

668
01:09:31,680 --> 01:09:34,353
Jacket, jacket, where's my...

669
01:09:37,760 --> 01:09:39,990
It's my pleasure to meet
Willy Helbing...

670
01:09:40,200 --> 01:09:42,998
No, dear stranger.

671
01:09:47,760 --> 01:09:51,673
Edith von Turoff.
I'm pleased to meet you.

672
01:09:51,880 --> 01:09:55,190
Can you spare me 5 minutes?
- In what matter?

673
01:09:56,240 --> 01:09:58,913
I'd like to speak to you in private.

674
01:10:00,160 --> 01:10:03,197
Pity.
- Yes, I'd like to have listened.

675
01:10:09,320 --> 01:10:11,914
Will you please be seated?

676
01:10:19,600 --> 01:10:23,832
I've often admired your
efficiency at the garage.

677
01:10:24,040 --> 01:10:27,237
There's a plan to found
a garage company...

678
01:10:27,440 --> 01:10:30,830
...for which they are looking
for a competent director.

679
01:10:31,560 --> 01:10:35,678
I'm sorry, you must look
for another director.

680
01:10:35,880 --> 01:10:37,677
Why?

681
01:10:38,880 --> 01:10:41,678
I intend to leave Berlin for good.

682
01:10:41,880 --> 01:10:44,713
<i>It's more blessed to give</i>
<i>than to receive</i>

683
01:10:57,000 --> 01:11:01,278
If I accept your offer,
then only on one condition.

684
01:11:01,480 --> 01:11:05,189
That you engage
my two colleagues with me.

685
01:11:07,760 --> 01:11:10,035
Your condition's accepted.

686
01:11:11,440 --> 01:11:15,592
Gentlemen, you'll hear from
me again today.

687
01:11:15,800 --> 01:11:19,031
Good-bye.
- Good-bye, madam.

688
01:11:20,080 --> 01:11:22,116
Many thanks, madam.

689
01:11:25,520 --> 01:11:28,990
It was delightful.
- Yes, it was very nice.

690
01:11:31,920 --> 01:11:34,957
You two fools,
I thought we were angry.

691
01:11:35,200 --> 01:11:37,839
We'd almost forgotten that.
- Yes, really.

692
01:11:38,040 --> 01:11:40,395
If we're going to get on
together promise me one thing.

693
01:11:40,600 --> 01:11:44,752
The name of the girl who almost tore
us apart will never be mentioned.

694
01:11:44,960 --> 01:11:46,951
Good, agreed.
- Word of honour.

695
01:11:47,160 --> 01:11:48,991
Word of honour.

696
01:13:01,800 --> 01:13:04,109
Shut up, we're working here...

697
01:13:04,320 --> 01:13:09,235
...this is the directors' office
of Kutag, Kuckuck Tank AG.

698
01:13:49,040 --> 01:13:54,592
<i>Never be gloomy</i>

699
01:13:56,560 --> 01:14:02,317
<i>If your sweetheart</i>
<i>no longer loves you</i>

700
01:14:02,680 --> 01:14:06,673
<i>A friend, a good friend...</i>
<i>- Shut up!</i>

701
01:14:28,680 --> 01:14:31,240
Kutag general management here.

702
01:14:31,440 --> 01:14:36,230
Kutag general management here.
Yes... No, no...

703
01:14:36,440 --> 01:14:40,558
...here's the general manager's secretary.

704
01:14:41,040 --> 01:14:44,669
You want to speak to the
general manager personally?

705
01:14:44,880 --> 01:14:48,429
Well, no.
Let's see... well, I'll see...

706
01:14:48,640 --> 01:14:53,395
...if the general manager can speak
to you. One moment, please.

707
01:15:07,640 --> 01:15:13,272
I very much regret that
the general manager is not available.

708
01:15:13,480 --> 01:15:16,199
The entire management is...

709
01:15:16,560 --> 01:15:18,710
Be quiet! Let me do it!

710
01:15:19,040 --> 01:15:22,112
I wanted to say the manager
is at a conference.

711
01:15:22,320 --> 01:15:27,348
But I've got full authority, with whom
do I have the pleasure of speaking?

712
01:15:28,280 --> 01:15:29,633
Pardon?

713
01:15:30,680 --> 01:15:33,148
The telephone exchange?

714
01:15:34,440 --> 01:15:38,911
What do you want, miss? You only
wanted to hear if the phone works?

715
01:15:39,120 --> 01:15:43,671
You can see that, hear it.
Am I a crackling?

716
01:15:46,520 --> 01:15:50,672
Damn it, take the thing away,
it's absurd, say, it's ridiculous.

717
01:15:52,920 --> 01:15:54,512
That's...

718
01:16:11,320 --> 01:16:14,437
Don't get upset,
it's just the fire department.

719
01:16:19,600 --> 01:16:20,874
Come in.

720
01:16:22,520 --> 01:16:25,830
A young lady's here.

721
01:16:26,040 --> 01:16:27,871
What kind of young lady?

722
01:16:28,080 --> 01:16:30,594
Oh, our money lender's protge.

723
01:16:30,800 --> 01:16:32,836
Oh, from Frau von Turoff.
- Who?

724
01:16:33,040 --> 01:16:37,556
The secretary she recommended
to us. Let her wait.

725
01:16:39,960 --> 01:16:43,589
Have you gone mad?
- She'll tell Turoff everything.

726
01:16:43,800 --> 01:16:47,952
Go on, you work, you write,
I'll telephone.

727
01:16:49,000 --> 01:16:54,199
Please, is that the Bank for
petrol trade and garage supplies?

728
01:16:54,400 --> 01:16:56,960
Here's the Kutag general manager.

729
01:16:57,480 --> 01:17:01,075
Kutag, yes. Kuckuck Tank AG.

730
01:17:01,280 --> 01:17:03,396
Good day, gentlemen.

731
01:17:07,360 --> 01:17:09,920
I'm your new secretary.

732
01:17:18,200 --> 01:17:20,714
Out of the question.
- Pardon?

733
01:17:22,240 --> 01:17:24,629
The job's already taken.

734
01:17:25,240 --> 01:17:26,468
But Willy...

735
01:17:29,040 --> 01:17:32,316
...she's our money lenders protge.

736
01:17:32,520 --> 01:17:36,115
Don't you see that
this is all a conspiracy.

737
01:17:36,840 --> 01:17:40,196
I'll not be a part of it.
- Willy, go on. Go on...

738
01:17:40,400 --> 01:17:44,871
Do you believe that the vamp
seriously intends to work here?

739
01:17:45,080 --> 01:17:48,675
Mistake. The vamp
seriously intends to work.

740
01:17:49,240 --> 01:17:53,358
That's what she came here for.
- Can you type at all?

741
01:17:53,560 --> 01:17:55,676
Naturally.

742
01:17:56,040 --> 01:17:58,793
Please, I'm here, sit there.

743
01:17:59,000 --> 01:18:02,117
Please be seated.
- Are you comfortable?

744
01:18:02,320 --> 01:18:04,880
Don't be afraid.
- It'll be all right.

745
01:18:05,080 --> 01:18:07,913
Please, convince yourself.

746
01:18:08,480 --> 01:18:10,391
I'm curious about that.

747
01:18:11,160 --> 01:18:15,756
<i>First comes a large</i>
<i>question mark</i>

748
01:18:16,400 --> 01:18:20,916
<i>Which means</i>
<i>how can I soften you up?</i>

749
01:18:21,320 --> 01:18:25,950
<i>Then a dash</i>

750
01:18:26,160 --> 01:18:31,109
<i>Which means:</i>
<i>My sweetheart, I love you</i>

751
01:18:31,320 --> 01:18:36,269
<i>Then from time to time</i>
<i>whilst kissing</i>

752
01:18:36,480 --> 01:18:41,270
<i>You have to put in</i>
<i>a small comma</i>

753
01:18:41,480 --> 01:18:45,473
<i>And finally a full stop</i>

754
01:18:46,440 --> 01:18:50,115
<i>Which means: Leave me alone</i>

755
01:18:52,680 --> 01:18:55,831
So, and now to you, miss.

756
01:18:57,600 --> 01:18:58,953
Yes, sir.

757
01:19:03,000 --> 01:19:04,956
Better than I thought.

758
01:19:08,080 --> 01:19:11,595
It's of no use.
Write another letter.

759
01:19:11,800 --> 01:19:13,358
Yes, sir.

760
01:19:22,680 --> 01:19:24,591
Are you ready?
- Go ahead.

761
01:19:25,000 --> 01:19:28,037
To the board of directors
of Kutag.

762
01:19:32,640 --> 01:19:36,633
Since the company was founded
under other conditions...

763
01:19:36,840 --> 01:19:37,989
Other conditions?

764
01:19:38,200 --> 01:19:41,636
Write, took place under
circumstances...

765
01:19:43,520 --> 01:19:45,954
...other than they appeared to be...

766
01:19:51,160 --> 01:19:54,709
...and I want to build up my
existence under my own steam...

767
01:19:54,920 --> 01:19:59,198
...and not thanks to the protection
of some kind of female...

768
01:19:59,400 --> 01:20:02,039
Have you got it?
- Female, naturally.

769
01:20:02,240 --> 01:20:07,951
...female...
I give notice as of today.

770
01:20:08,880 --> 01:20:12,316
And resign from the board of Kutag.

771
01:20:13,280 --> 01:20:15,316
Have you got that?

772
01:20:15,600 --> 01:20:20,116
...and resign as of today
from the board of Kutag.

773
01:20:20,920 --> 01:20:24,230
And perhaps you'll add:
Yours faithfully?

774
01:20:24,440 --> 01:20:26,112
Yes, as you like.

775
01:20:26,920 --> 01:20:30,708
And respectfully?
I find that very polite.

776
01:20:31,000 --> 01:20:36,028
So, and now, sir,
just your signature, please.

777
01:20:41,560 --> 01:20:43,118
Put it down.

778
01:20:51,280 --> 01:20:54,955
Is there anything else?

779
01:21:02,000 --> 01:21:05,117
What were you doing in there?
Willy, be sensible!

780
01:21:05,320 --> 01:21:08,630
Don't give up our garage company.

781
01:21:09,000 --> 01:21:10,638
Characterless fools.

782
01:21:10,840 --> 01:21:13,308
Listen...
You're past helping.

783
01:21:13,520 --> 01:21:15,238
He's mad.

784
01:21:45,920 --> 01:21:49,515
<i>Cheers to the young couple</i>

785
01:21:49,720 --> 01:21:53,633
<i>We offer our congratulations</i>

786
01:21:53,840 --> 01:21:57,116
<i>Cheers to the young couple</i>

787
01:21:57,320 --> 01:22:01,233
<i>Come to my heart,</i>
<i>dear son-in-law</i>

788
01:22:01,440 --> 01:22:05,274
<i>Be mine and be kissed</i>

789
01:22:05,480 --> 01:22:08,756
<i>Because today's your wedding day</i>

790
01:22:08,960 --> 01:22:10,359
<i>The bride</i>

791
01:22:10,560 --> 01:22:12,437
<i>The beautiful bride</i>

792
01:22:12,640 --> 01:22:15,950
<i>You stole from us</i>

793
01:22:16,960 --> 01:22:18,552
Have you all gone mad?

794
01:22:18,760 --> 01:22:20,637
On the contrary, we're delighted!

795
01:22:20,840 --> 01:22:24,196
About the super marriage contract.

796
01:22:24,400 --> 01:22:28,359
<i>Marriage contract?</i>
<i>Who's marrying who?</i>

797
01:22:28,560 --> 01:22:32,439
<i>Marriage contract,</i>
<i>how am I to understand that?</i>

798
01:22:32,680 --> 01:22:36,753
<i>Here, read it,</i>
<i>then you'll be informed</i>

799
01:22:37,320 --> 01:22:41,916
<i>You dictated it yourself</i>

800
01:22:43,320 --> 01:22:47,199
<i>Dictated it yourself,</i>
<i>dictated yourself, for the marriage</i>

801
01:22:47,400 --> 01:22:51,109
<i>Dictated yourself,</i>
<i>yes, dictated yourself</i>

802
01:22:56,440 --> 01:23:01,912
<i>I declare herewith that</i>
<i>Miss Lilian Cossmann</i>

803
01:23:02,120 --> 01:23:07,638
<i>Is the sweetest girl</i>
<i>in the world</i>

804
01:23:11,240 --> 01:23:13,754
<i>And I consider myself lucky</i>

805
01:23:13,960 --> 01:23:18,158
<i>To marry her here on the spot</i>

806
01:23:18,360 --> 01:23:21,113
<i>The sooner the better</i>

807
01:23:22,400 --> 01:23:26,951
<i>I never dictated that, I didn't</i>

808
01:23:27,160 --> 01:23:29,071
<i>It's not true</i>

809
01:23:29,280 --> 01:23:34,559
<i>Here's your signature,</i>
<i>plain and clear</i>

810
01:23:35,360 --> 01:23:38,591
<i>That's true, that's true</i>

811
01:23:38,800 --> 01:23:42,918
<i>Good bait catches fine fish,</i>
<i>but not me</i>

812
01:23:43,120 --> 01:23:49,070
<i>Stop. Listen to what it says</i>
<i>in the legal code</i>

813
01:23:54,680 --> 01:24:00,232
<i>If someone promises marriage</i>

814
01:24:00,720 --> 01:24:06,272
<i>And breaks his promise deliberately</i>

815
01:24:06,720 --> 01:24:11,714
<i>Then it's been the rule for years</i>

816
01:24:12,360 --> 01:24:17,559
<i>To imprison the culprit on demand</i>

817
01:24:17,760 --> 01:24:22,038
<i>The penalty for the crime</i>

818
01:24:22,400 --> 01:24:28,236
<i>Will be at least twenty-one weeks</i>

819
01:24:28,520 --> 01:24:30,636
Oh, so that's what you mean!

820
01:24:30,840 --> 01:24:33,673
A clever bit of blackmail!

821
01:24:33,880 --> 01:24:38,271
My girl, between us
everything's settled, isn't it?

822
01:24:38,480 --> 01:24:42,598
First we'll go to the altar...
- And then?

823
01:24:42,800 --> 01:24:48,158
<i>And then we'll get a divorce</i>

824
01:24:48,360 --> 01:24:52,114
<i>What does it matter?</i>
<i>You're only interested</i>

825
01:24:52,320 --> 01:24:54,151
<i>In being a married woman...</i>

826
01:24:57,440 --> 01:25:01,115
I've had enough of this,
thanks, I can do without.

827
01:25:01,640 --> 01:25:05,713
<i>Bravo!</i>
<i>- It calls from the wilds</i>

828
01:25:06,520 --> 01:25:09,193
<i>Take another husband</i>

829
01:25:09,400 --> 01:25:12,119
<i>Look at me closely</i>

830
01:25:14,960 --> 01:25:17,394
<i>I've had enough</i>

831
01:25:18,440 --> 01:25:22,274
<i>I've had enough,</i>
<i>I'm not a dog</i>

832
01:25:22,480 --> 01:25:26,268
<i>You tormented me for 20 years,</i>
<i>I said yes to everything</i>

833
01:25:26,480 --> 01:25:29,916
<i>Whatever happened was my fault,</i>
<i>now I've lost my patience</i>

834
01:25:30,120 --> 01:25:32,759
<i>I say no and no again</i>
<i>- Don't shout!</i>

835
01:25:32,960 --> 01:25:35,554
<i>I want to shout!</i>
<i>- Consul, this is too much!</i>

836
01:25:35,760 --> 01:25:38,354
I speak now! Be quiet!

837
01:25:39,360 --> 01:25:43,638
<i>Listen and take note,</i>
<i>I'm going to make Edith my wife</i>

838
01:25:43,840 --> 01:25:48,277
<i>When, where and how I like,</i>
<i>and if you complain</i>

839
01:25:48,480 --> 01:25:52,519
<i>I'll spank your bottom</i>
<i>no matter what happens</i>

840
01:26:08,000 --> 01:26:09,115
Stop!

841
01:26:10,440 --> 01:26:14,911
I'll never allow you
to so brutally attack...

842
01:26:15,120 --> 01:26:20,035
...such a defenceless, weak...

843
01:26:20,280 --> 01:26:24,432
...charming, sweet creature.

844
01:26:25,520 --> 01:26:27,351
Well, thank God.

845
01:26:37,000 --> 01:26:42,472
<i>Only with you can I be happy</i>

846
01:26:43,920 --> 01:26:50,109
<i>All our sweet dreams</i>

847
01:26:50,920 --> 01:26:56,677
<i>Will come true today</i>

848
01:26:58,720 --> 01:27:00,233
And us?

849
01:27:00,440 --> 01:27:03,352
What's going to happen to us?

850
01:27:06,840 --> 01:27:12,119
<i>No one here to love us</i>

851
01:27:13,320 --> 01:27:17,632
<i>A friend, a good friend</i>

852
01:27:17,840 --> 01:27:21,071
<i>Is the best thing that there is</i>

853
01:27:21,280 --> 01:27:23,077
That's enough now!

854
01:27:29,920 --> 01:27:32,150
But, Willy!
- What is it now?

855
01:27:32,360 --> 01:27:34,999
The people!
- What people?

856
01:27:35,200 --> 01:27:37,760
The audience.
- Where?

857
01:27:39,600 --> 01:27:41,033
There!

858
01:27:43,080 --> 01:27:46,595
Yes, really...
And all strangers, too.

859
01:27:47,600 --> 01:27:50,637
What are they doing here?
The film is over.

860
01:27:50,840 --> 01:27:52,319
Shall we ask them?

861
01:27:52,520 --> 01:27:55,478
Ladies and gentlemen...
- Wait, Willy!

862
01:27:55,680 --> 01:27:59,434
I know why!
A real operetta needs a finale.

863
01:27:59,640 --> 01:28:01,278
Oh, I see.

864
01:28:01,480 --> 01:28:03,152
Lilian, come with me.

865
01:28:06,520 --> 01:28:08,636
Just a moment, please.

866
01:29:46,120 --> 01:29:48,076
THE END
