1
00:03:18,280 --> 00:03:21,240
- Hi, Maile.
- Hi, Eddie.

2
00:03:21,320 --> 00:03:24,360
Are you mad at me? I haven't had
to chase you for a week.

3
00:03:24,440 --> 00:03:27,480
This time you're not
going to talk me out of it.

4
00:03:27,560 --> 00:03:29,520
But I'm in a big hurry.

5
00:03:29,600 --> 00:03:32,800
How many times do I have
to warn you? Fly now, pay later.

6
00:03:32,880 --> 00:03:36,240
Please, no lectures.
I'm late. Chad's coming home.

7
00:03:36,320 --> 00:03:40,280
- Chad? Home from Europe?
- His plane's probably landing now.

8
00:03:40,360 --> 00:03:43,280
Follow me.
Let's not keep the soldier waiting.

9
00:03:43,360 --> 00:03:45,400
Thank you, Eddie.

10
00:04:21,240 --> 00:04:23,200
Thanks, Eddie! Bye!

11
00:04:29,960 --> 00:04:33,400
- Hi, Wahilla.
- Maile. You got passengers arriving?

12
00:04:33,480 --> 00:04:37,720
- Just one. Chad's out of the Army.
- Chad? Here, with my compliments.

13
00:04:37,800 --> 00:04:42,160
United Airlines flight now
arriving at United Airlines ramp.

14
00:05:04,240 --> 00:05:06,280
Wahilla, I think I'm scared.

15
00:05:06,360 --> 00:05:09,520
He's been gone for two years.
What if he's changed?

16
00:05:09,600 --> 00:05:11,560
Just be patient with him.

17
00:05:11,640 --> 00:05:15,520
Some boys need time
to get adjusted to being back home.

18
00:05:23,320 --> 00:05:27,920
- Some of 'em get it right away.
- Hi, Maile. Hi, Wahilla.

19
00:05:28,160 --> 00:05:32,800
- Hi, Chad.
- It worked. She's jealous.

20
00:05:32,880 --> 00:05:34,840
She should be.

21
00:05:35,000 --> 00:05:38,360
Please, come along.
Get going, will you? Move along.

22
00:05:38,440 --> 00:05:41,800
- He's been in the service overseas.
- For two years.

23
00:05:41,880 --> 00:05:45,840
I did three years, but all I got when
I came back was coffee and donuts.

24
00:05:45,920 --> 00:05:47,280
Excuse me, sir.

25
00:05:47,360 --> 00:05:49,840
- Thanks again.
- Thank you.

26
00:05:51,000 --> 00:05:53,960
- Maile.
- I'm not speaking to you.

27
00:05:59,760 --> 00:06:02,160
- I was only having some fun.
- I saw you.

28
00:06:02,240 --> 00:06:04,400
You knew I'd be waiting for you.

29
00:06:04,480 --> 00:06:08,560
- How could you kiss that girl?
- It was easy. I mean...

30
00:06:08,640 --> 00:06:10,640
You call that a kiss?

31
00:06:14,400 --> 00:06:16,160
That's a kiss.

32
00:06:16,240 --> 00:06:21,160
My French blood tells me to argue and
my Hawaiian blood tells me not to,

33
00:06:21,240 --> 00:06:24,400
and they're really battling
it out inside of me.

34
00:06:24,480 --> 00:06:28,080
I've never seen a more
beautiful battleground.

35
00:06:28,480 --> 00:06:31,160
All right, soldier. You win.

36
00:06:33,480 --> 00:06:36,040
- Yeah.
- Welcome home.

37
00:06:39,840 --> 00:06:42,800
I wonder where he took
his basic training.

38
00:06:42,880 --> 00:06:44,840
In Hawaii.

39
00:06:52,120 --> 00:06:54,920
Sure you don't want to drive?
It's still your car.

40
00:06:55,000 --> 00:06:58,880
I'm fine right here. And you
sure kept them both in good shape.

41
00:06:58,960 --> 00:07:02,080
- Both?
- Your body and my car's.

42
00:07:02,160 --> 00:07:05,520
- "Pupule".
- I'll show you who's crazy. Hit it!

43
00:07:11,720 --> 00:07:14,480
- What are you doing?
- I'm not going home now.

44
00:07:16,560 --> 00:07:18,520
"Wikiwiki" - to the beach.

45
00:07:37,240 --> 00:07:39,760
- I missed you, Maile.
- I missed you, too.

46
00:07:39,840 --> 00:07:43,680
What were you doing all that time
while I was missing you?

47
00:07:43,760 --> 00:07:46,320
- Being true to you.
- Always?

48
00:07:46,400 --> 00:07:49,400
- Almost always.
- You mean to tell me...?

49
00:09:05,360 --> 00:09:07,320
Hi there!

50
00:09:18,560 --> 00:09:22,360
What are we waiting for?
Got your bathing suit?

51
00:09:22,440 --> 00:09:25,240
- I brought you one from Paris.
- But I've got a job!

52
00:09:25,320 --> 00:09:27,480
- Today's a Hawaiian holiday.
- It is?

53
00:09:27,560 --> 00:09:30,720
- You never heard of hooky-hooky day?
- Hooky-hooky!

54
00:09:30,800 --> 00:09:32,760
Come on.

55
00:09:34,520 --> 00:09:37,000
The old shack.
The boys really kept it up.

56
00:09:37,080 --> 00:09:39,480
I used to think a lot
about this place.

57
00:09:39,560 --> 00:09:42,720
I was afraid it might change,
but it's still beautiful.

58
00:09:42,800 --> 00:09:45,440
- This is for me.
- You're not going to stay here.

59
00:09:45,520 --> 00:09:48,120
I got a roof over my head,
a cot, a stove...

60
00:09:48,200 --> 00:09:51,320
But you've got a beautiful
house in Kahala, and a family.

61
00:09:51,400 --> 00:09:53,160
Let's get this over with.

62
00:09:53,240 --> 00:09:56,920
All the time I was overseas, I got
a letter from my folks every week

63
00:09:57,000 --> 00:10:02,080
reminding me of my beautiful future
in my dad's pineapple business.

64
00:10:02,160 --> 00:10:05,720
And the more they reminded me,
the more I knew I couldn't come back

65
00:10:05,800 --> 00:10:08,320
with my life laid out for me.

66
00:10:08,400 --> 00:10:12,360
It's too easy to fall into that
setup. I got to do this myself.

67
00:10:12,440 --> 00:10:14,600
- Can't you tell them that?
- I will!

68
00:10:14,680 --> 00:10:16,720
- Good!
- When the time is right.

69
00:10:16,800 --> 00:10:19,160
Please don't take too much time.

70
00:10:19,240 --> 00:10:22,400
I don't know how long I can wait
for you to grow up.

71
00:10:22,480 --> 00:10:26,520
You're a pretty fresh kid.
I think I'll let you have one.

72
00:10:26,600 --> 00:10:28,560
Why, you little...!

73
00:11:04,080 --> 00:11:07,960
- What's so funny?
- I bought it to welcome you home.

74
00:11:08,040 --> 00:11:12,800
- It's the first time I've worn it.
- On you, wet is my favourite colour.

75
00:11:19,080 --> 00:11:21,400
- Hi.
- Hello. Where'd you come from?

76
00:11:21,480 --> 00:11:23,840
What's the matter?
Cat got your tongue?

77
00:11:27,840 --> 00:11:30,920
- Could I play with you?
- You're too young for this game.

78
00:11:31,000 --> 00:11:33,440
If I get a girl, can I play with you?

79
00:11:33,520 --> 00:11:35,800
He's not as young as I thought.

80
00:11:35,880 --> 00:11:38,440
The game's over, pal.
Maybe some other time.

81
00:11:38,520 --> 00:11:40,800
- Bye.
- Bye.

82
00:11:40,880 --> 00:11:43,240
- Let's go for a swim.
- Might as well.

83
00:11:43,320 --> 00:11:45,280
We can't dance.

84
00:11:48,000 --> 00:11:49,960
The suit's in this bag.

85
00:11:57,720 --> 00:11:59,480
- Ready?
- Almost.

86
00:11:59,560 --> 00:12:03,320
- Did you really buy this in Paris?
- First three-day pass I had.

87
00:12:03,400 --> 00:12:05,360
- How's it fit?
- You tell me.

88
00:12:08,480 --> 00:12:09,840
And wow.

89
00:12:09,920 --> 00:12:12,440
Don't you think the sleeves
are a little long?

90
00:12:12,520 --> 00:12:14,480
I used to dream of you in a muu-muu.

91
00:12:14,560 --> 00:12:18,640
If my grandmother saw this, she'd
sew me up in a muu-muu for life.

92
00:12:18,720 --> 00:12:20,680
- Don't ya like it?
- I love it.

93
00:12:20,760 --> 00:12:22,960
And I thank you for thinking of me.

94
00:12:23,040 --> 00:12:26,680
I wasn't thinking of you.
I was thinking of me.

95
00:12:47,000 --> 00:12:49,760
- Now can I play?
- Can he play?

96
00:12:49,840 --> 00:12:52,280
Sure, kids. Later.

97
00:12:56,280 --> 00:12:59,000
- You said I can play.
- Later.

98
00:13:19,280 --> 00:13:21,320
It's Chad! Maile!

99
00:13:22,840 --> 00:13:26,960
- Hello, Chad! Maile!
- Hello there!

100
00:14:05,840 --> 00:14:08,560
- Chaddio!
- Ho there!

101
00:14:12,720 --> 00:14:15,720
- When did you get back?
- Today, brother.

102
00:14:18,880 --> 00:14:22,040
- What did they feed you in the army?
- Lead, man. All lead.

103
00:14:22,120 --> 00:14:23,880
Hey, Chad.

104
00:15:09,120 --> 00:15:12,520
- We sure missed you, brother!
- I missed you, brothers!

105
00:15:12,600 --> 00:15:14,360
Good to see you!

106
00:15:14,440 --> 00:15:17,080
You guys are
still travelling light!

107
00:15:17,160 --> 00:15:20,600
Sarge, what happened
to all your medals?

108
00:15:20,680 --> 00:15:22,840
This is it. This is all I got.

109
00:15:22,920 --> 00:15:27,400
- Look at Duke!
- Look at Duke! He missed you, too!

110
00:15:27,480 --> 00:15:30,520
- He looks great.
- But he's still as stupid as ever.

111
00:15:30,600 --> 00:15:35,320
Lay off! You know Duke's sensitive.
You'll hurt his feelings.

112
00:15:35,400 --> 00:15:38,000
Ito, your chest slipped
from here to here!

113
00:15:38,080 --> 00:15:39,840
- Paul, you still slaphappy?
- Yeah!

114
00:16:17,720 --> 00:16:20,560
Shave and a haircut, two bits!

115
00:16:26,120 --> 00:16:28,080
Where is it?

116
00:16:28,160 --> 00:16:32,240
- Maile, you coming in soon?
- I'm not ready to come in!

117
00:16:32,320 --> 00:16:35,320
Let her swim, Chad.
Chaddio, tell us about Naples.

118
00:16:36,960 --> 00:16:40,040
How were those cool,
crazy Italian chicks?

119
00:16:40,120 --> 00:16:42,920
I picked up this little number.

120
00:16:43,000 --> 00:16:45,760
- You really want to hear about it?
- Yeah!

121
00:16:45,840 --> 00:16:49,040
- No engagement rings?
- Come on. Let's hear it.

122
00:18:33,200 --> 00:18:36,880
- Maile, come on in, will you?
- Not yet!

123
00:18:56,280 --> 00:18:58,560
Dig this crazy seaweed.

124
00:18:58,640 --> 00:19:01,840
That's no seaweed. That's the top
of Maile's bathing suit!

125
00:19:01,920 --> 00:19:04,080
Maile, just stay right there!

126
00:19:09,480 --> 00:19:12,360
Maile! Don't come out!
Just stay there!

127
00:19:18,400 --> 00:19:20,760
He's bringing a shirt out to her.

128
00:19:22,960 --> 00:19:25,600
I told you.
That dog is just plain stupid.

129
00:19:25,680 --> 00:19:27,640
Quiet! He's sensitive.

130
00:19:27,720 --> 00:19:30,200
He can't hear me
way out there. Can he?

131
00:19:31,840 --> 00:19:34,960
It's all here, what time
your plane leaves and lands in Maui.

132
00:19:35,040 --> 00:19:37,720
- Thank you very much.
- Have a nice time.

133
00:19:37,800 --> 00:19:40,800
- Thank you.
- Come back and see us.

134
00:19:42,480 --> 00:19:45,360
- Hello, Mr Gates.
- Hello, Maile.

135
00:19:45,440 --> 00:19:48,200
I'll come right to the point.
Is my son here?

136
00:19:48,280 --> 00:19:52,240
- Chad? Here?
- I hear he's been home for days.

137
00:19:52,320 --> 00:19:55,480
If this is true,
I know that you've seen him. Well?

138
00:19:56,600 --> 00:20:00,800
That's good enough for me. Chad's
mother doesn't know about this.

139
00:20:00,880 --> 00:20:02,840
I want him home before she finds out.

140
00:20:02,920 --> 00:20:06,360
If he doesn't consider my feelings,
he owes consideration to her.

141
00:20:06,440 --> 00:20:08,400
I leave it to you.

142
00:20:08,480 --> 00:20:10,680
- Goodbye, Maile.
- Goodbye, Mr Gates.

143
00:20:27,960 --> 00:20:32,960
- Hi, O'Hara. Don't you take judo?
- Man don't live on muscles alone.

144
00:20:33,040 --> 00:20:35,000
You got any ketchup in that bag?

145
00:20:35,080 --> 00:20:37,440
No, but I have
some lipstick. Same colour.

146
00:20:37,520 --> 00:20:42,840
- Lipstick fattening. I'm on a diet.
- Oh, yeah.

147
00:20:42,920 --> 00:20:45,080
- Where's Chad?
- Back in the briny.

148
00:20:45,160 --> 00:20:49,160
Even though there's no surf,
he's right back in the swim.

149
00:20:49,240 --> 00:20:51,200
He's about to be beached.

150
00:21:15,840 --> 00:21:20,240
- It's about time you got here.
- I left half an hour early as it is.

151
00:21:20,320 --> 00:21:23,480
The fellas are having a "luau"
at the outrigger. I said we'd go.

152
00:21:23,560 --> 00:21:26,080
Can't. The whole family's
meeting in Haleiwa.

153
00:21:26,160 --> 00:21:29,320
- At your grandmother's?
- It's her birthday. She's 78.

154
00:21:29,400 --> 00:21:32,080
That's something
to celebrate. Am I invited?

155
00:21:32,160 --> 00:21:35,120
- You're hiding out, remember?
- Not from your folks.

156
00:21:35,200 --> 00:21:40,560
Yours, either.
Your father came to see me today.

157
00:21:40,640 --> 00:21:42,600
He knows you're back.

158
00:21:42,680 --> 00:21:45,360
- You've got to go home sometime.
- Why?

159
00:21:45,440 --> 00:21:48,080
You can't spend your life
on a surfboard.

160
00:21:48,160 --> 00:21:52,800
Yes I can. The GI bill of rights
says I get my old job back.

161
00:21:52,880 --> 00:21:57,840
- This is my old job.
- Like I said... Yankee, go home!

162
00:21:57,920 --> 00:22:02,720
Wait a...
Hey, wait! I'll get you!

163
00:22:04,320 --> 00:22:08,680
It's certainly nice to have you here.
Here we are.

164
00:22:08,760 --> 00:22:11,640
Daddy, let's drink
a toast to your boss.

165
00:22:17,600 --> 00:22:20,280
Every time I come here,
I feel like a prize fool.

166
00:22:20,360 --> 00:22:23,720
I saw the latest company statement
raising the dividends.

167
00:22:23,800 --> 00:22:25,560
You're no fool, boss.

168
00:22:25,640 --> 00:22:29,000
Then how come I moved you here
and kept myself on the mainland?

169
00:22:29,080 --> 00:22:31,040
To your glorious Hawaiian winters.

170
00:22:43,160 --> 00:22:48,120
Mr Gates! Mr Gates!
Mr Gates, guess who here!

171
00:22:48,320 --> 00:22:51,000
He's home!
Just drive up in car, from Army!

172
00:22:51,080 --> 00:22:53,360
- Who?
- Our boy Chadwick!

173
00:22:53,440 --> 00:22:58,440
Chadwick! Daddy! Jack! It's
Chadwick! My boy's home from the war!

174
00:22:58,520 --> 00:23:03,200
- Sarah Lee, there wasn't any war.
- Well, don't just stand there!

175
00:23:05,240 --> 00:23:07,000
Chadwick, my boy!

176
00:23:07,080 --> 00:23:09,040
- Hiya, Mom!
- Welcome home, Son.

177
00:23:09,120 --> 00:23:11,320
Hi, Pop. Jack!
Didn't expect to see you!

178
00:23:11,400 --> 00:23:13,360
Just checking up on your old man.

179
00:23:13,440 --> 00:23:15,400
- You're looking good.
- Thank you.

180
00:23:15,480 --> 00:23:18,400
- Ping Pong, shut off that water!
- Don't get wet.

181
00:23:20,280 --> 00:23:23,600
Hello, Mr Chadwick.
You have swinging time in Europe?

182
00:23:23,680 --> 00:23:26,200
Pingo, the swingingest, boy.

183
00:23:26,280 --> 00:23:28,040
How are you, boy?

184
00:23:28,120 --> 00:23:31,040
Doesn't he look marvellous?
Go get the camera.

185
00:23:31,120 --> 00:23:33,360
Later, Sarah Lee. Later.

186
00:23:33,440 --> 00:23:35,640
- Come in.
- I have to get my bags, Mom.

187
00:23:35,720 --> 00:23:38,240
Don't worry, Mr Chadwick.
I get bags...

188
00:23:44,520 --> 00:23:46,480
I got it! I got it!

189
00:23:47,680 --> 00:23:50,280
Tell cook we'll let her know
when to serve.

190
00:23:50,360 --> 00:23:52,760
- We want to talk to our boy.
- "Oui, oui", missy.

191
00:23:52,840 --> 00:23:57,400
We must give a welcome-home party for
Chadwick. It could be for Jack, too.

192
00:23:57,480 --> 00:24:00,520
Forget about me.
Just invite Chad's friends.

193
00:24:00,600 --> 00:24:03,560
Those nasty little beach boys? No.

194
00:24:03,640 --> 00:24:06,440
I'm sure Chadwick's got
all that foolishness

195
00:24:06,520 --> 00:24:08,600
out of his system, after the war.

196
00:24:08,680 --> 00:24:12,840
Sarah Lee, how many times do I have
to tell you, he was not in a war.

197
00:24:12,920 --> 00:24:16,320
I know, Daddy, but if I don't
tell myself there was a war,

198
00:24:16,400 --> 00:24:20,160
I have a most depressing feeling
Chadwick's just wasted two years.

199
00:24:21,000 --> 00:24:23,360
Chadwick, sweet boy.

200
00:24:24,560 --> 00:24:28,160
- Feels good to get into civvies.
- Why'd you take off your suit?

201
00:24:28,240 --> 00:24:30,640
You looked just like
Stonewall Jackson.

202
00:24:30,720 --> 00:24:35,680
- You got some sugar for your mama?
- How about a drink, civilian?

203
00:24:35,760 --> 00:24:38,240
Give him
some of your pineapple juice.

204
00:24:38,320 --> 00:24:41,120
- Missed it, boy?
- Yeah.

205
00:24:41,200 --> 00:24:43,880
You should try
the new rum drink. Jack...

206
00:24:43,960 --> 00:24:46,920
Chadwick's a growing boy,
and I don't think it proper

207
00:24:47,000 --> 00:24:51,120
- to give him intoxicating libations.
- I'd like to tell you...

208
00:24:51,200 --> 00:24:54,400
- We were talking about your party.
- What party?

209
00:24:54,480 --> 00:24:57,480
Your coming-home party to celebrate
your return from the war.

210
00:24:57,560 --> 00:25:01,400
We can have the Wilsons
and the Pomfrets. They're a must.

211
00:25:01,480 --> 00:25:04,600
They get absolutely
hilarious at parties.

212
00:25:04,680 --> 00:25:07,520
They get absolutely stoned,
is what they get.

213
00:25:07,600 --> 00:25:11,920
Yes. Chadwick, I think
it would be much impressier

214
00:25:12,000 --> 00:25:14,560
if you wore your uniform
with all your medals.

215
00:25:14,640 --> 00:25:16,600
I didn't win any medals, Mom.

216
00:25:16,680 --> 00:25:19,440
Of course you did.
What were they on your suit?

217
00:25:19,520 --> 00:25:22,360
- Just marksmanship and good conduct.
- You see, Daddy?

218
00:25:22,440 --> 00:25:25,400
You just have to hit a target
instead of an officer.

219
00:25:25,480 --> 00:25:29,240
You remind me of my great-grandfather
on my side. Captain Matthew Polk.

220
00:25:29,320 --> 00:25:32,760
He was one of the bravest men
in the war between the states.

221
00:25:32,840 --> 00:25:37,520
The daring deeds that man
performed, his bravery under fire.

222
00:25:37,600 --> 00:25:41,880
His courage on the field of battle
made us all proud to be Polks.

223
00:25:41,960 --> 00:25:46,000
It's such a shame Captain Polk
was a damn Yankee.

224
00:25:46,080 --> 00:25:48,480
Chad, which one do you want?

225
00:25:50,880 --> 00:25:54,560
- Let me see.
- You need it, boy. Take your pick.

226
00:25:55,920 --> 00:25:58,480
I'll stick
to the straight pineapple juice.

227
00:25:58,560 --> 00:26:01,200
We must decide on the orchestra
for the party.

228
00:26:01,280 --> 00:26:06,480
If you'll excuse me, I'll freshen up
a little before dinner. "Aloha".

229
00:26:06,560 --> 00:26:09,920
- Orchestra? How about my friends?
- You mean those native boys?

230
00:26:10,000 --> 00:26:13,720
- The swingingest group around.
- They are not musicians, Chadwick.

231
00:26:13,800 --> 00:26:17,520
- They're just beach boys.
- They've turned professional.

232
00:26:17,600 --> 00:26:19,960
How do you know that?

233
00:26:20,040 --> 00:26:24,120
He corresponded with them
while he was in Europe.

234
00:26:24,200 --> 00:26:27,960
Chadwick, we might as well have
an understanding right off.

235
00:26:28,040 --> 00:26:31,840
You've come home to stay and
your life's going to be different.

236
00:26:31,920 --> 00:26:35,600
You'll associate yourself with
the finer elements on this island,

237
00:26:35,680 --> 00:26:38,080
and you're gonna have
a responsible position

238
00:26:38,160 --> 00:26:41,120
with the Great Southern
Hawaiian Fruit Company,

239
00:26:41,200 --> 00:26:45,840
marry a girl of your own class
and be a gentleman like your daddy.

240
00:26:45,920 --> 00:26:47,880
Do we have to discuss this now?

241
00:26:47,960 --> 00:26:50,640
I don't want you
wasting your precious time

242
00:26:50,720 --> 00:26:52,920
on those beach boys
or that native girl.

243
00:26:53,000 --> 00:26:55,680
Sarah Lee, the boy just came home.

244
00:26:55,760 --> 00:26:58,440
I think he should know
what we expect of him.

245
00:26:58,520 --> 00:27:00,600
I know what you expect of me.

246
00:27:00,680 --> 00:27:03,840
I thought I could come back
and do what you want me to.

247
00:27:03,920 --> 00:27:07,200
- Now I know I can't.
- How? You just got back.

248
00:27:07,280 --> 00:27:10,480
- I've been back for five days, Mom.
- Five days?

249
00:27:10,560 --> 00:27:15,040
I've been living in my shack
and dreading telling you.

250
00:27:15,120 --> 00:27:19,080
I'm not gonna work for the Great
Southern Hawaiian Fruit Company.

251
00:27:19,160 --> 00:27:21,120
- Sarah Lee.
- Yes, Daddy?

252
00:27:21,200 --> 00:27:23,160
Let's talk about it tomorrow, Son.

253
00:27:23,240 --> 00:27:26,840
Home five days and he didn't
even come to his mother.

254
00:27:26,920 --> 00:27:30,600
Mom, it's time I started
doing something for myself,

255
00:27:30,680 --> 00:27:32,760
like making my own decisions.

256
00:27:35,760 --> 00:27:39,120
Your mother hasn't finished,
and you haven't had your dinner.

257
00:27:39,200 --> 00:27:41,840
All of a sudden,
I'm not hungry. Good night.

258
00:27:46,000 --> 00:27:48,960
He didn't even give
his mama any good night sugar.

259
00:27:49,040 --> 00:27:52,840
Sarah Lee, there are times
when I could wring your fool neck.

260
00:28:10,000 --> 00:28:13,680
- Good evening, I'll take your car.
- Thank you.

261
00:29:22,600 --> 00:29:27,160
It is a pleasant surprise, Chad.
We were not expecting you.

262
00:29:27,240 --> 00:29:29,840
I came to pay my respects
to Maile's grandmother.

263
00:29:33,520 --> 00:29:35,280
We have a visitor.

264
00:29:35,360 --> 00:29:40,400
He dropped by to pay his respects
to your grandmother. Excuse me.

265
00:29:40,480 --> 00:29:44,680
- I thought you were going home.
- I did. I'm out on good behaviour.

266
00:29:45,960 --> 00:29:48,240
Your father
said he was glad to see me.

267
00:29:48,320 --> 00:29:50,280
I'm glad to see you, too.

268
00:29:51,400 --> 00:29:53,800
Come wish grandmother
a happy birthday.

269
00:29:54,960 --> 00:29:57,280
Grandmother, you remember Chad.

270
00:29:57,960 --> 00:30:01,480
I am delighted to see you again.
Welcome back from the Army.

271
00:30:01,560 --> 00:30:05,400
"Aloha!" And Happy birthday!
I brought you a gift from Austria.

272
00:30:05,480 --> 00:30:10,760
Thank you. But the light you kindle
in my granddaughter's eye is enough.

273
00:30:12,360 --> 00:30:14,720
It's a music box.
It plays a European love song.

274
00:30:14,800 --> 00:30:16,760
It's the same in any language.

275
00:32:02,160 --> 00:32:06,000
- That's lovely, Chad.
- And so are you, Grandmother.

276
00:32:23,440 --> 00:32:26,080
Sure beats lunch in town, doesn't it?

277
00:32:26,160 --> 00:32:28,560
You don't get this view in town,
either.

278
00:32:28,640 --> 00:32:31,720
And it was easier
to get a reservation here.

279
00:32:49,840 --> 00:32:52,520
Your grandmother
packs a pretty picnic.

280
00:32:52,600 --> 00:32:56,480
The way to a man's heart.
She's making sure I reach yours.

281
00:32:56,560 --> 00:32:59,920
Especially after last night.
She loved the music box.

282
00:33:00,000 --> 00:33:02,120
I'm glad. She's a wonderful lady.

283
00:33:02,200 --> 00:33:04,640
The difference between
your family and mine!

284
00:33:04,720 --> 00:33:08,800
We're not our families, Chad.
We're what we make of ourselves.

285
00:33:08,880 --> 00:33:11,600
You're right.
If I'm gonna make anything of myself,

286
00:33:11,680 --> 00:33:13,720
it's time I took hold of things.

287
00:33:13,800 --> 00:33:16,320
While you're in the mood
to take hold...

288
00:33:19,560 --> 00:33:21,880
Maile, I've got to get a job.

289
00:33:21,960 --> 00:33:24,640
And not in
your father's pineapple plant?

290
00:33:24,720 --> 00:33:28,040
No, ma'am. No red carpet
where everybody knows who I am.

291
00:33:28,120 --> 00:33:31,200
"He's the boss' son. Be nice to him. "
That's not for me.

292
00:33:31,280 --> 00:33:34,640
Hawaii has a big future.
I wanna become a part of it.

293
00:33:34,720 --> 00:33:38,120
- I'm young, healthy, not too stupid.
- You're wonderful!

294
00:33:38,200 --> 00:33:42,560
This place is growing. More tourists
come here than any other state.

295
00:33:42,640 --> 00:33:46,400
- That's it! You thought of it.
- What?

296
00:33:46,480 --> 00:33:49,920
- Tourists! Your business is booming.
- Getting bigger all the time!

297
00:33:50,000 --> 00:33:52,360
I know the islands.
I'd be a good tourist guide.

298
00:33:52,440 --> 00:33:55,240
You'd be great!
I'll put a word in with my boss.

299
00:33:55,320 --> 00:33:58,640
No, you don't.
This mission is strictly solo.

300
00:33:58,720 --> 00:34:00,720
You're coming in loud and proud.

301
00:34:00,800 --> 00:34:04,640
I got to see your boss!
I've wasted too much time already.

302
00:34:06,800 --> 00:34:10,600
- Haven't you forgotten something?
- Oh, yeah.

303
00:34:26,000 --> 00:34:29,240
- What about me?
- Oh, yeah!

304
00:34:50,680 --> 00:34:54,280
These are not only decorative,
but they keep my neck warm.

305
00:34:54,360 --> 00:34:59,280
Let me see. Where were we?
We were somewhere, weren't we?

306
00:34:59,360 --> 00:35:04,160
I was telling you of my two years at
university before I joined the Army.

307
00:35:04,240 --> 00:35:07,880
The Army?
That's a lovely organisation.

308
00:35:09,200 --> 00:35:11,680
And you say you've
lived here for 50 years?

309
00:35:11,760 --> 00:35:16,160
50... No! 15 years. Since my father
was transferred from Atlanta.

310
00:35:16,240 --> 00:35:20,400
That's where Chad was born. Atlanta.

311
00:35:20,800 --> 00:35:25,800
He was. Yes.
Where is the Crouching Lion?

312
00:35:25,880 --> 00:35:29,480
That's a rock formation on a cliff
just north of Kaaawa beach.

313
00:35:29,560 --> 00:35:32,000
It used to be
a native fishing shrine.

314
00:35:32,080 --> 00:35:34,840
Well. That's good. That's very good.

315
00:35:34,920 --> 00:35:37,760
That's excellent.
I'm testing you, you see.

316
00:35:37,840 --> 00:35:40,560
Have to be on your toes
to work for a man like me.

317
00:35:40,640 --> 00:35:43,720
- Yes, sir.
- Yes, you do.

318
00:35:43,800 --> 00:35:47,360
Now, I am a tourist
from Chillicothe, Ohio.

319
00:35:47,440 --> 00:35:51,120
I want to see night-blooming cereus
blossoms. Where would you take me?

320
00:35:51,200 --> 00:35:55,960
- I'd take you to the Punahou School.
- You would? That is good.

321
00:35:56,040 --> 00:36:00,760
Yes, well... That's splendid.
This young man knows, Miss Duval.

322
00:36:00,840 --> 00:36:05,800
I think he might do. He might.
Well, I'll think it over.

323
00:36:05,880 --> 00:36:09,800
- When will you let me know, sir?
- When I know, of course.

324
00:36:10,840 --> 00:36:13,400
- Yes, sir.
- Thank you, Mr Chapman.

325
00:36:13,480 --> 00:36:15,360
Thank you, Mr Chapman.

326
00:36:20,920 --> 00:36:25,560
Beautiful. Beautiful!
That's Mr Chadwick.

327
00:36:25,640 --> 00:36:29,640
Quick, cover it up, Ping Pong.
I don't want him to see it.

328
00:36:29,720 --> 00:36:32,760
Everything looks so festive,
doesn't it, Daddy?

329
00:36:34,000 --> 00:36:36,280
- Where's Chadwick?
- On the telephone.

330
00:36:36,360 --> 00:36:41,040
- Straighten your tie. Is he dressed?
- He was the last time I looked.

331
00:36:41,120 --> 00:36:44,400
Fetch me a mai tai, Ping Pong.
We got more bar glasses?

332
00:36:44,480 --> 00:36:48,800
- I'll check.
- Do that. Parties, parties!

333
00:36:50,280 --> 00:36:52,760
Mr Chapman didn't promise anything.

334
00:36:52,840 --> 00:36:56,000
Something came up unexpectedly
and he needs you.

335
00:36:56,080 --> 00:36:59,600
- It's a new client, a schoolteacher.
- Teacher?

336
00:36:59,680 --> 00:37:01,840
- She wants to meet you.
- Now?

337
00:37:01,920 --> 00:37:05,800
It won't take long. Meet me
at the Hawaiian Village Hotel.

338
00:37:05,880 --> 00:37:08,440
I don't have much luck
with teachers.

339
00:37:08,520 --> 00:37:13,240
- She'll like you. Don't be late.
- I'll pick you up.

340
00:37:13,320 --> 00:37:17,240
- Pick who up?
- 10 minutes. Goodbye.

341
00:37:17,320 --> 00:37:19,520
I have to run out for about an hour.

342
00:37:19,640 --> 00:37:22,320
You can't!
Our guests will be arriving soon.

343
00:37:22,360 --> 00:37:25,680
Cocktails at seven and dinner
at eight thirty. Who was that?

344
00:37:25,760 --> 00:37:27,280
- Maile.
- Chadwick...

345
00:37:27,360 --> 00:37:30,400
I agreed to ask your beach boys
to provide music...

346
00:37:30,480 --> 00:37:33,600
If you want me back in time,
don't start anything now.

347
00:37:33,680 --> 00:37:35,640
Chadwick? Fix your tie.

348
00:37:49,560 --> 00:37:51,680
She's supposed to meet us here.

349
00:37:51,760 --> 00:37:54,440
- Have you met her before?
- No, I haven't.

350
00:37:54,520 --> 00:37:58,680
We shouldn't have any difficulty
in finding a schoolteacher.

351
00:37:58,760 --> 00:38:00,800
I could spot one a mile away.

352
00:38:08,240 --> 00:38:10,440
Good afternoon.

353
00:38:10,520 --> 00:38:14,520
I'm Miss Duval from the Hawaii
Tourist Service. This is Mr Gates.

354
00:38:14,600 --> 00:38:16,600
How do you do? I'm Mrs Ingersol.

355
00:38:16,680 --> 00:38:19,640
- And I'm Abigail Prentace...
- How do you do?

356
00:38:19,720 --> 00:38:21,840
...the schoolteacher.

357
00:38:22,320 --> 00:38:24,840
Sure. You can spot them a mile away.

358
00:38:25,600 --> 00:38:29,640
- Won't you join me?
- Certainly. We beg your pardon.

359
00:38:30,160 --> 00:38:33,800
- I'm terribly sorry.
- That's all right, Miss Duval.

360
00:38:33,880 --> 00:38:37,640
I didn't expect a guide dressed
like Mr Gates. He is the guide?

361
00:38:37,720 --> 00:38:41,120
Yes. These aren't my working clothes.
There's a party tonight.

362
00:38:41,200 --> 00:38:44,040
Mr Gates comes from one
of our finest families.

363
00:38:44,120 --> 00:38:46,200
That's certainly in his favour.

364
00:38:46,280 --> 00:38:50,160
I must be very careful as
I'm chaperoning four teenage girls.

365
00:38:50,240 --> 00:38:52,080
It's a great responsibility.

366
00:38:52,160 --> 00:38:55,400
I get along well with teenagers.
I used to be one myself.

367
00:38:55,480 --> 00:39:00,600
And not too long ago. Frankly, Miss
Duval, I was expecting an older man.

368
00:39:00,680 --> 00:39:04,760
As part of the service, I promise
to get a little older every day.

369
00:39:04,840 --> 00:39:07,120
If you would prefer another guide,

370
00:39:07,200 --> 00:39:10,000
I'm sure the office
could arrange it for you.

371
00:39:10,080 --> 00:39:12,640
We like to keep
our customers satisfied.

372
00:39:12,720 --> 00:39:15,160
Mr Gates,
do you think you can satisfy

373
00:39:15,240 --> 00:39:17,960
a schoolteacher
and four teenage girls?

374
00:39:18,040 --> 00:39:21,320
I'll sure try, ma'am.
I'll do all I can.

375
00:39:21,400 --> 00:39:24,680
What I mean is, this is
their first trip to the islands,

376
00:39:24,760 --> 00:39:28,040
and the girls are curious
about the local activities.

377
00:39:28,120 --> 00:39:31,600
Like surfboard riding.
Can you arrange instruction?

378
00:39:31,680 --> 00:39:33,680
- I'll teach 'em myself.
- You?

379
00:39:33,760 --> 00:39:37,640
I grew up on a surfboard. Outriggers,
catamarans, I can handle 'em all.

380
00:39:37,720 --> 00:39:41,520
- How wonderful!
- He used to be an expert at sports.

381
00:39:41,600 --> 00:39:44,840
- Used to be?
- Before he went in the Army.

382
00:39:44,920 --> 00:39:47,800
He's been gone for two years.
He just got back.

383
00:39:47,880 --> 00:39:49,760
I'm afraid he's a little rusty.

384
00:39:49,840 --> 00:39:54,560
I'm afraid Miss Duval doesn't realise
how well-oiled I kept my machinery.

385
00:39:55,680 --> 00:39:59,600
- What time do we start tomorrow?
- Nine all right? Here?

386
00:39:59,680 --> 00:40:02,080
We'll be waiting.
Thank you for coming.

387
00:40:02,160 --> 00:40:04,280
It's a pleasure meeting you.

388
00:40:04,360 --> 00:40:06,520
- And you.
- Thank you.

389
00:40:08,400 --> 00:40:09,960
Maile?

390
00:40:15,200 --> 00:40:18,560
They didn't build teachers like that
when I was at school.

391
00:40:18,640 --> 00:40:21,880
She's all right,
if you happen to like older women.

392
00:40:21,960 --> 00:40:25,440
If she's older women, the rest
of the group are in big trouble!

393
00:40:27,440 --> 00:40:29,320
You can drop me off at my house.

394
00:40:29,400 --> 00:40:31,880
Drop you off?
We gotta celebrate my new job.

395
00:40:31,960 --> 00:40:35,720
- What about your mother's party?
- I'm the guide now.

396
00:40:38,400 --> 00:40:42,160
Do be careful, Daddy. Those
mai tais can be mighty powerful.

397
00:40:43,160 --> 00:40:48,040
- Thank you, Daddy. Hello, darlings.
- Hello! This is a lovely party.

398
00:40:48,120 --> 00:40:51,520
Thank you. Try the dip.
It's an old Carolina recipe.

399
00:40:51,600 --> 00:40:55,840
My grandmother brought it from
Charleston to Savannah. Delicious.

400
00:40:55,920 --> 00:40:57,960
- Hello, dears.
- Good evening.

401
00:40:58,040 --> 00:41:01,000
Isn't it delightful?
It's all so festive.

402
00:41:01,080 --> 00:41:05,280
Ping Pong, make sure Mr Karnibad's
glass doesn't get empty.

403
00:41:05,360 --> 00:41:09,400
- Oui, oui.
- That's French. He's learning it.

404
00:41:09,480 --> 00:41:11,680
So nice of you to come to my party.

405
00:41:11,760 --> 00:41:16,200
There you are, Admiral Anthony!
I see you have met Admiral Anthony.

406
00:41:16,280 --> 00:41:20,080
- General Anthony, Mrs Gates.
- You may be only a general now,

407
00:41:20,160 --> 00:41:23,040
but it's only a matter of time
before you're an admiral.

408
00:41:23,120 --> 00:41:27,360
- Hi, Chad. Hi, Maile.
- Hello, everybody.

409
00:41:27,440 --> 00:41:31,040
- Daddy?
- Excuse me. Yeah?

410
00:41:31,120 --> 00:41:33,680
- Look.
- Good, Chad's here.

411
00:41:33,760 --> 00:41:39,600
- Look who's with him. That girl.
- Yes. She's very attractive.

412
00:41:39,680 --> 00:41:44,480
- Aren't you forgetting yourself?
- I'm trying, Mother. I'm trying.

413
00:41:49,760 --> 00:41:52,520
- Nice to see you again.
- Thank you.

414
00:41:52,600 --> 00:41:56,440
This is my mother. It's about time
you met. Mom, Maile Duval.

415
00:41:56,520 --> 00:42:00,440
Very glad to meet you, Mrs Gates.
Chad's talked so much about you.

416
00:42:00,520 --> 00:42:05,960
He has? That's nice, Chadwick.
He's talked about you, too.

417
00:42:06,040 --> 00:42:11,160
- Yes. We've both talked about you.
- Yes!

418
00:42:12,440 --> 00:42:14,480
Looks like Maile's on the rack.

419
00:42:14,560 --> 00:42:17,160
- Are you staying for the party?
- I'd like to very much.

420
00:42:18,800 --> 00:42:21,480
- Let's get her off.
- Yeah. Let's rock!

421
00:43:38,200 --> 00:43:42,240
Daddy, I'm going to have a headache.
A dreadful headache.

422
00:44:14,640 --> 00:44:16,880
What was that?

423
00:44:16,960 --> 00:44:21,560
Something we have to get used to.
It's called the sound of youth.

424
00:44:35,160 --> 00:44:37,400
- Good morning, Miss Prentace
- Miss Duval.

425
00:44:37,480 --> 00:44:40,840
- Girls, Miss Duval.
- Morning, girls.

426
00:44:40,920 --> 00:44:43,800
- These are "alohas" for you.
- How lovely!

427
00:44:43,880 --> 00:44:45,920
Thank you.

428
00:44:50,000 --> 00:44:52,920
- How wonderful.
- It's very nice of you.

429
00:44:53,000 --> 00:44:54,760
Good morning.

430
00:44:54,840 --> 00:44:57,720
Well! You look more like a guide
this morning.

431
00:44:57,800 --> 00:45:01,560
- You don't look like a teacher.
- Girls, our guide.

432
00:45:01,640 --> 00:45:04,640
Shall we start
with the pineapple fields?

433
00:45:04,720 --> 00:45:06,480
I hate pineapples.

434
00:45:06,560 --> 00:45:09,680
Let's go there first
and get it over with.

435
00:45:09,760 --> 00:45:13,120
- Are you going with us?
- I have to get back to my office.

436
00:45:13,200 --> 00:45:16,560
- Can we give you a lift?
- No, it's just a few steps.

437
00:45:18,320 --> 00:45:20,120
Thank you.

438
00:45:23,840 --> 00:45:26,120
I hope you don't mind
being this crowded.

439
00:45:26,200 --> 00:45:27,960
Not at all.

440
00:45:29,880 --> 00:45:34,520
- Would you close the door, please?
- Have fun.

441
00:45:53,560 --> 00:45:55,520
Girls, this is the island of Oahu.

442
00:45:55,600 --> 00:45:58,240
Honolulu, our capital city,
is the largest island.

443
00:45:58,320 --> 00:46:02,120
- Anybody know the population?
- Population, population...

444
00:46:02,200 --> 00:46:04,720
Last count, 500,409.

445
00:46:04,800 --> 00:46:08,560
Correct. Give the young lady
a 5lb box of broken records.

446
00:46:09,600 --> 00:46:12,960
- Call me Beverly.
- I'm Patsy.

447
00:46:13,040 --> 00:46:17,000
- I'm Selena, but call me Sandy.
- And what's your name?

448
00:46:17,080 --> 00:46:20,240
You may call me Miss Corbett.

449
00:46:20,320 --> 00:46:22,880
You'll interested to know
that since 1778,

450
00:46:22,960 --> 00:46:25,960
we've been welcoming "malihinis"
from all over the world.

451
00:46:26,040 --> 00:46:28,800
- Welcoming what?
- "Malihinis". That's us.

452
00:46:28,880 --> 00:46:31,280
- I thought we were "wahines".
- You're both.

453
00:46:31,360 --> 00:46:34,080
"Malihini" means newcomers.
"Wahine" means female.

454
00:46:34,160 --> 00:46:36,000
- We're "wahine malihinis"!
- Big deal.

455
00:46:37,600 --> 00:46:39,200
Patsy, must you?

456
00:46:39,280 --> 00:46:42,760
- I did it! I'm bored!
- That's quite rude, Ellie!

457
00:46:42,840 --> 00:46:46,080
It's OK, Miss Prentace.
Make it louder, duchess.

458
00:48:21,920 --> 00:48:23,560
All right, everybody out.

459
00:48:26,640 --> 00:48:28,760
This is a small pineapple field!

460
00:48:28,840 --> 00:48:31,600
- What are those women doing?
- Picking the ripe fruit.

461
00:48:31,680 --> 00:48:34,920
Conveyor belt hauls it to
the trucks, then to the factories.

462
00:48:35,000 --> 00:48:37,000
Why do they still pick them by hand?

463
00:48:37,080 --> 00:48:39,600
Before you pick them,
they gotta be ripe.

464
00:48:39,680 --> 00:48:43,960
- The human eye decides that.
- That's interesting.

465
00:48:44,040 --> 00:48:47,600
And nobody's come up with
a better way to break them off.

466
00:48:47,680 --> 00:48:50,640
- That doesn't look so tough.
- No? Try it.

467
00:48:50,720 --> 00:48:52,680
- Be careful.
- It bites!

468
00:48:52,760 --> 00:48:55,720
See? They're tricky.
Full of sharp little edges.

469
00:48:55,800 --> 00:48:57,920
Can you get us a pineapple, Chad?

470
00:48:58,000 --> 00:49:01,200
I think that could be arranged.
Cold slices of pineapple.

471
00:49:01,280 --> 00:49:03,840
- A little stand over here.
- Pineapple?

472
00:49:03,920 --> 00:49:09,240
- What did you expect? Bananas?
- Ellie, don't you want some?

473
00:49:09,320 --> 00:49:12,880
- Hello, Mr Gates.
- My friends would like pineapple.

474
00:49:12,960 --> 00:49:15,280
- Certainly.
- I bet it's delicious.

475
00:49:15,360 --> 00:49:17,840
- I need something cool.
- Have you tried it with salt?

476
00:49:17,920 --> 00:49:20,840
- Salt?
- It's real good.

477
00:49:20,920 --> 00:49:22,520
I'll take this to Ellie.

478
00:49:24,960 --> 00:49:27,600
- I thought you might like some.
- I don't.

479
00:49:27,680 --> 00:49:29,720
It's good. Why don't you try it?

480
00:49:31,880 --> 00:49:33,120
Thank you!

481
00:49:37,240 --> 00:49:40,200
That's pretty rude.
Are you always so bored or is it me?

482
00:49:40,280 --> 00:49:42,240
Life is a bore, I always say.

483
00:49:42,320 --> 00:49:45,040
- Already?
- I've had 17 years of it.

484
00:49:45,120 --> 00:49:47,760
That's the fun part.
Wait till the next 17.

485
00:49:47,840 --> 00:49:52,080
Don't you start that
child psychology bit. I'm no child.

486
00:49:52,160 --> 00:49:54,080
I'm no psychologist.

487
00:49:54,160 --> 00:49:58,640
I believe you're being paid to show
us a good time. When does it start?

488
00:49:58,720 --> 00:50:01,960
- The others are having fun.
- They're drips.

489
00:50:02,040 --> 00:50:05,440
- Why did you come with them?
- It wasn't my idea.

490
00:50:05,520 --> 00:50:08,280
I've got two mothers
and three fathers.

491
00:50:08,360 --> 00:50:11,000
You must come
from a very rich family.

492
00:50:11,080 --> 00:50:14,720
- You're a very funny man!
- I'm sorry...

493
00:50:14,800 --> 00:50:18,160
Don't be. Just find some action.
Got a match?

494
00:50:18,240 --> 00:50:20,480
- I don't use them.
- It figures.

495
00:50:20,560 --> 00:50:25,920
- What's your idea of action?
- What's yours?

496
00:50:27,320 --> 00:50:30,560
You're a funny girl.
Just wait and see.

497
00:51:22,480 --> 00:51:24,520
Yes, Mr Chapman?

498
00:51:24,600 --> 00:51:27,840
- Miss Duval, come in here, please.
- Yes, sir.

499
00:51:28,640 --> 00:51:32,720
Yes, dear, but...
Well, I certainly will, dear.

500
00:51:32,800 --> 00:51:36,800
All right, eight thirty sharp.
All right, dear. Goodbye.

501
00:51:37,360 --> 00:51:40,480
My wife. I promised to take her
to the concert tonight.

502
00:51:40,560 --> 00:51:46,120
I must remember that, too. Concert.
Miss Duval, what is it you want?

503
00:51:46,200 --> 00:51:51,400
- Mr Chapman, you sent for me.
- I did? Well, what is it I want?

504
00:51:51,640 --> 00:51:55,400
- Has it anything to do with Chad?
- Chad who?

505
00:51:55,480 --> 00:52:00,760
- Chad Gates, remember?
- Yes. He's a fine-looking boy.

506
00:52:00,840 --> 00:52:03,240
He's bright, too. We should hire him.

507
00:52:03,320 --> 00:52:05,680
He's been working for you
for two days.

508
00:52:05,760 --> 00:52:08,280
He's the guide
for Miss Prentace's girls.

509
00:52:08,360 --> 00:52:10,760
Girls? Wait a minute. Look here.

510
00:52:10,840 --> 00:52:13,640
I don't want guides
carrying on with girls.

511
00:52:13,720 --> 00:52:18,680
- There's no hanky-panky here.
- He's showing them the local colour.

512
00:52:18,760 --> 00:52:21,040
Tonight he's taking them
to a "hukilau".

513
00:52:21,120 --> 00:52:24,520
A "hukilau"?
Well, that sounds like fun.

514
00:52:24,800 --> 00:52:28,640
My fish.
Well, you should enjoy that.

515
00:52:28,720 --> 00:52:32,160
I'm not going. He's taking
Miss Prentace and the girls.

516
00:52:32,240 --> 00:52:37,600
Miss Prentace. She's a lovely woman.
They make a handsome couple.

517
00:52:37,680 --> 00:52:40,560
- Yes, young Gates and Miss Prentace.
- They do?

518
00:52:40,640 --> 00:52:45,440
Yes. She's quite taken with the boy.
She's even extended her tour.

519
00:52:45,520 --> 00:52:49,320
Now that's hanky-panky
from where I stand.

520
00:52:49,400 --> 00:52:52,040
What? Excuse me. Please sit down.

521
00:52:52,120 --> 00:52:55,920
No, Mr Chapman, that's all right.
I don't need a seat.

522
00:52:56,000 --> 00:52:58,960
I do. I'll take two for the concert.

523
00:52:59,040 --> 00:53:02,480
The concert, that's what
I wanted to speak to you about.

524
00:53:02,560 --> 00:53:05,440
Could you take my wife
to the concert tonight?

525
00:53:05,520 --> 00:53:09,760
I'm afraid I can't. I've decided
I'd better go to the "hukilau".

526
00:53:09,840 --> 00:53:12,240
To the "hukilau"?
If you can't make it,

527
00:53:12,320 --> 00:53:14,840
I'll have to go to the concert
by myself.

528
00:53:14,920 --> 00:53:16,720
Yes, Mr Chapman.

529
00:53:18,080 --> 00:53:21,800
"Hukilau". My fish. I... Yeah.

530
00:53:21,880 --> 00:53:27,280
Yeah. Come on, boys. Come on.
You girls, too. There.

531
00:53:29,840 --> 00:53:32,480
- Can I help you?
- No, we're OK. We'll talk later.

532
00:53:32,560 --> 00:53:36,680
Girls? Patsy? Beverly? Sandy?
Come on.

533
00:53:36,760 --> 00:53:39,760
Chad, can you go get
some firewood for dinner?

534
00:53:39,840 --> 00:53:45,240
- Firewood? You'll eat anything!
- Watch it, man!

535
00:53:45,320 --> 00:53:49,600
- Isn't this a beautiful spot?
- Lovely. Look at the palm trees.

536
00:53:55,600 --> 00:53:57,560
- Do you want some help?
- What?

537
00:54:00,720 --> 00:54:03,120
- What are you trying to do?
- I did it.

538
00:54:03,200 --> 00:54:05,760
- Congratulations.
- Didn't you like it?

539
00:54:05,840 --> 00:54:08,880
- You'll get us in trouble.
- Do you want to kiss me again?

540
00:54:08,960 --> 00:54:13,560
- I want you to behave yourself.
- Why? Afraid you might like it?

541
00:54:13,640 --> 00:54:15,600
I don't rob cradles.

542
00:54:18,280 --> 00:54:21,440
Did you ever see anything like this
in a cradle?

543
00:54:26,280 --> 00:54:29,000
Come here, Ellie. Hold out your arms.

544
00:54:30,680 --> 00:54:35,120
Close your little eyes.
Take this to Ito.

545
00:56:29,120 --> 00:56:34,480
- Come on. Catch the fish!
- Come on, let's go! "Hukilau"!

546
00:56:34,560 --> 00:56:36,440
Who needs group fishing?

547
00:56:36,520 --> 00:56:40,120
If you don't pull the net,
you don't eat the fish. Let's go.

548
00:56:44,800 --> 00:56:47,080
The men need help! Come on!

549
00:57:21,640 --> 00:57:23,600
Boy, am I full!

550
00:57:23,680 --> 00:57:26,520
Lto, this is the best fish
I ever tasted.

551
00:57:26,600 --> 00:57:28,560
Positively delicious.

552
00:57:28,640 --> 00:57:31,720
- I've had enough.
- We all have!

553
00:57:31,800 --> 00:57:35,840
- Good! That leaves more for me.
- You've had six already, man.

554
00:57:35,920 --> 00:57:39,720
Ernest, counting is not couth.

555
00:57:40,120 --> 00:57:42,720
Ito eats like teeth
are going out of style!

556
00:59:00,320 --> 00:59:02,440
- Slice some sand!
- Yeah!

557
01:00:30,840 --> 01:00:34,200
The last few days I don't know
what time that boy's gotten in.

558
01:00:34,280 --> 01:00:38,520
It was after one last night.
I woke up when I heard our dog bark.

559
01:00:38,600 --> 01:00:40,800
I thought it was Chadwick coming in.

560
01:00:40,880 --> 01:00:44,400
Then I realised it couldn't be,
cos we don't have a dog.

561
01:00:44,480 --> 01:00:49,360
- Are you listening to me, Daddy?
- Oh, yes!

562
01:00:49,440 --> 01:00:53,440
Ping Pong, my eggs are cold.
Take them back and warm them up.

563
01:00:53,520 --> 01:00:56,480
- Oui, oui. Morning, Mr Chadwick.
- Hi, Ping.

564
01:00:56,560 --> 01:01:00,440
- You want some cold eggs?
- No, thanks. I'll stick to juice.

565
01:01:00,520 --> 01:01:02,720
Thank you. Good morning, Mom, Pop.

566
01:01:02,800 --> 01:01:06,040
Morning. You got some sugar
for your mama this morning?

567
01:01:06,120 --> 01:01:09,640
- You're up early this morning.
- Have to, Pop. I got a job.

568
01:01:09,720 --> 01:01:11,680
A job? Working?

569
01:01:11,760 --> 01:01:16,160
I've been an employee of the Hawaiian
Tourist Service for three days.

570
01:01:16,240 --> 01:01:19,640
- How could you?
- I thought you wanted me to work.

571
01:01:19,720 --> 01:01:23,560
Not as a common employee.
Why be a messenger boy for tourists

572
01:01:23,640 --> 01:01:27,920
when you could follow your daddy's
footsteps, and be vice president

573
01:01:28,000 --> 01:01:32,080
of the Great Southern Hawaiian Fruit?
I fail to comprehend you.

574
01:01:32,160 --> 01:01:35,920
I like my job. It's fun, interesting
and I meet a lot of nice people.

575
01:01:36,000 --> 01:01:41,160
Nonsense! Tourists aren't people.
They're... They're tourists.

576
01:01:41,240 --> 01:01:45,520
- Easy, Sarah Lee. I'm sensitive.
- Morning, Jack.

577
01:01:45,600 --> 01:01:50,760
Tell me, Chad, where does another
tourist meet these nice people?

578
01:01:50,840 --> 01:01:54,080
Try the Island Inn.
They're having a "luau" tonight.

579
01:01:54,160 --> 01:01:57,520
I'm late. I'm meeting
with the Grievance Committee.

580
01:01:57,600 --> 01:02:00,320
- Want to sit in?
- Not me! I'm on vacation.

581
01:02:00,400 --> 01:02:02,080
- Can you drop me off?
- Sure.

582
01:02:02,160 --> 01:02:05,320
- Where's your car?
- I can drive the company car.

583
01:02:05,400 --> 01:02:07,720
- Bye, Mom, Jack.
- See you tonight.

584
01:02:11,120 --> 01:02:16,960
Land! My son driving tourists
around like a chauffeur!

585
01:02:17,040 --> 01:02:19,360
It's a disgrace.

586
01:02:20,480 --> 01:02:24,120
I don't know. When you married
Fred, he was a chauffeur,

587
01:02:24,200 --> 01:02:26,840
driving bananas
around in my old truck.

588
01:02:26,920 --> 01:02:29,400
I'd rather drive girls than bananas!

589
01:04:11,480 --> 01:04:14,480
- Right this way, folks.
- Right after you, boy!

590
01:04:16,040 --> 01:04:18,600
You girls really shake that grass!

591
01:04:20,520 --> 01:04:24,600
And you wanted me to go to Chicago
and visit your mother, Enid.

592
01:04:26,000 --> 01:04:28,560
- Beautiful song.
- It was lovely, Chad.

593
01:04:28,640 --> 01:04:32,600
They taught us that corny hula stuff
in school when I was three.

594
01:04:32,680 --> 01:04:34,800
You were never three.

595
01:04:36,960 --> 01:04:38,920
It's good. What's it called?

596
01:04:39,000 --> 01:04:43,000
A mai tai. You finish this one,
I'll order another. Miss.

597
01:04:43,080 --> 01:04:45,480
Another of these tummy-warmers.

598
01:04:45,560 --> 01:04:48,680
We got some real pretty company
over here.

599
01:04:48,760 --> 01:04:53,160
Howdy, ma'am. I'm Tucker Garvey.
This is my wife Enid. Say hello.

600
01:04:54,920 --> 01:05:00,280
- We're from Tulsa, Oklahoma.
- Allo! I am from Paris, France.

601
01:05:00,360 --> 01:05:03,880
What you know? I sure
like a pretty little French girl.

602
01:05:03,960 --> 01:05:06,880
Say some more of that talk
for me, Fifi.

603
01:05:06,960 --> 01:05:14,520
Je suis filet avec sole. Oui, oui?
Chateau Frontenac... Big boy.

604
01:05:19,760 --> 01:05:25,840
So sorry! I make ze big mistake.
I thought it was a pig's knuckle.

605
01:05:26,320 --> 01:05:32,000
- Take it easy, Frenchy.
- You are very brave, big boy.

606
01:05:35,280 --> 01:05:37,240
Well, Fifi!

607
01:05:39,080 --> 01:05:41,280
Parlez-vous francais?

608
01:05:43,600 --> 01:05:47,040
Let's dance. Come on!
Come on, Frenchy. Let's dance.

609
01:05:48,760 --> 01:05:51,160
- Wait a minute!
- Let me go!

610
01:05:51,240 --> 01:05:53,320
- Let's dance.
- I don't want to!

611
01:05:53,400 --> 01:05:55,800
- You wanna dance, don't you?
- No!

612
01:05:55,880 --> 01:05:59,760
You're going to dance. Come on.
You're stepping out of line.

613
01:05:59,840 --> 01:06:03,080
- That's my business!
- It's my business, too.

614
01:06:03,160 --> 01:06:04,880
Thank you, duchess.

615
01:06:04,960 --> 01:06:08,640
That was wonderful, young man.
How about dancing with me?

616
01:06:08,720 --> 01:06:10,800
We haven't finished eating yet.

617
01:06:10,880 --> 01:06:14,360
Come on, handsome.
Garvey, tell him to dance with me.

618
01:06:14,440 --> 01:06:17,320
- Go and dance with Enid.
- You dance with her.

619
01:06:17,400 --> 01:06:20,040
Not me. I've been dancing
with her for 15 years.

620
01:06:20,120 --> 01:06:22,240
I'm gonna dance with Frenchy here.

621
01:06:22,320 --> 01:06:26,520
Excuse me, Mr Garvey. I think you
should go home and sleep it off, sir.

622
01:06:26,600 --> 01:06:28,800
You watch who you're calling names.

623
01:06:28,880 --> 01:06:31,760
You're gonna wind up
sleeping it off. Get lost.

624
01:06:31,840 --> 01:06:34,000
- We can settle this...
- I said move.

625
01:06:34,080 --> 01:06:35,840
Chad, please!

626
01:06:35,920 --> 01:06:40,040
Go on. Turn him loose, sis.
Turn that tiger loose.

627
01:06:41,600 --> 01:06:43,400
Thump him, Garvey!

628
01:06:46,160 --> 01:06:50,040
Garvey! Get up, Garvey! Get up!

629
01:06:52,920 --> 01:06:54,880
Chad, look out!

630
01:07:02,280 --> 01:07:04,560
Hit him for Fifi!

631
01:07:23,920 --> 01:07:26,680
Emergency! Emergency! Police!

632
01:09:34,000 --> 01:09:37,680
Hey, you! Cork up the wailin'.
I said cork it up!

633
01:09:38,400 --> 01:09:40,200
Wait a minute...

634
01:09:42,680 --> 01:09:47,680
Beautiful. You guys sing beautiful.
I hope you get life with me.

635
01:09:54,480 --> 01:09:58,080
- Dad, I know how you feel...
- I posted your bail. Let's go.

636
01:09:58,160 --> 01:10:00,800
- What about the others?
- They'll be out soon.

637
01:10:00,880 --> 01:10:03,040
They all have sympathetic fathers.

638
01:10:03,120 --> 01:10:05,960
- I'm very upset, Chad.
- I couldn't help it.

639
01:10:06,040 --> 01:10:09,720
I thought this guide idea
would teach you responsibility.

640
01:10:09,800 --> 01:10:11,640
There he is! I'll fix you!

641
01:10:11,720 --> 01:10:14,520
Mrs Garvey,
I'm sorry about your black eye.

642
01:10:14,600 --> 01:10:18,480
There he is! I've got him.
Lieutenant, arrest this man.

643
01:10:18,560 --> 01:10:20,520
But he's just been released.

644
01:10:20,600 --> 01:10:24,400
Released? That's not right.
Not at all. He's a violent boy!

645
01:10:24,480 --> 01:10:26,800
Just a minute. I'm this boy's father.

646
01:10:26,880 --> 01:10:29,880
If it runs in the family,
he may strike again. Mrs Garvey!

647
01:10:29,960 --> 01:10:35,440
Mrs Garvey knows how wild he is. She
told me all about it. My goodness!

648
01:10:35,520 --> 01:10:38,360
You should never wear green
with that eye.

649
01:10:39,800 --> 01:10:43,320
- Who is this character anyway?
- This is my boss, Dad.

650
01:10:43,400 --> 01:10:45,600
Your ex-boss. You're fired!

651
01:10:45,680 --> 01:10:49,480
He was only protecting your clients.
You can't fire him.

652
01:10:49,560 --> 01:10:53,480
Yes, I can. I'll do it again.
Just watch me. You're fired! See?

653
01:10:53,560 --> 01:10:55,480
Let me explain what happened.

654
01:10:55,560 --> 01:10:58,320
I don't want an expla...
Just the money. $700.

655
01:10:58,400 --> 01:11:00,920
- Why?
- For the damages your son caused.

656
01:11:01,000 --> 01:11:03,880
- What a mess it was.
- I haven't got $700.

657
01:11:03,960 --> 01:11:07,360
- Then your father will pay it!
- I will not!

658
01:11:07,440 --> 01:11:10,960
- The newspapers will be on my side.
- What newspapers?

659
01:11:11,040 --> 01:11:14,480
The ones I gave the story to,
one of your guides had a fight

660
01:11:14,560 --> 01:11:17,200
and everybody went to jail.
That's good, huh?

661
01:11:17,280 --> 01:11:20,520
Yeah, that's good.
No! That's very bad for business.

662
01:11:20,600 --> 01:11:23,800
I'll sue the newspapers.
That's good, isn't it?

663
01:11:23,880 --> 01:11:27,240
- Yes. That's good.
- I'll waive the release.

664
01:11:27,320 --> 01:11:31,280
No, you won't. He can't do that!
He's going to ruin my business.

665
01:11:31,360 --> 01:11:34,680
I demand, Lieutenant,
that you release...

666
01:11:34,760 --> 01:11:39,080
- Send him home. Just send him home.
- He's free to go.

667
01:11:39,160 --> 01:11:41,400
- Come on, Chad. Let's go.
- Maile.

668
01:11:41,480 --> 01:11:44,400
Miss Duval,
I'll see you back at the office.

669
01:11:44,480 --> 01:11:49,240
- No, you won't, I just quit.
- Quit?! You can't do that!

670
01:11:49,320 --> 01:11:53,640
Yes, I can. I'll do it again.
Watch. I quit! See?

671
01:12:03,000 --> 01:12:04,760
My baby!

672
01:12:06,120 --> 01:12:11,240
My baby! My baby's home
from the big house!

673
01:12:11,320 --> 01:12:13,840
Will you forget those old movies?

674
01:12:13,920 --> 01:12:18,200
You are all right, aren't you?
They didn't grill you under a lamp?

675
01:12:18,280 --> 01:12:21,040
No. No grilling, no lamp.
I'm just fine.

676
01:12:21,120 --> 01:12:25,600
I do hope this doesn't get back home.
There hasn't been a Gates in jail

677
01:12:25,680 --> 01:12:29,320
since your moonshinin' uncle
was caught squeezin' corn.

678
01:12:29,400 --> 01:12:31,480
He was your uncle. He was a Polk.

679
01:12:31,560 --> 01:12:34,520
Mom, I'm sorry,
but it wasn't my fault.

680
01:12:34,600 --> 01:12:37,640
I know that, dear.
It's your friends.

681
01:12:37,720 --> 01:12:40,840
Mostly that Duval girl.
She's the one to blame.

682
01:12:40,920 --> 01:12:44,000
- Maile had nothing to do with it.
- She was there.

683
01:12:44,080 --> 01:12:48,000
You work in her tourist place.
Who else can we blame?

684
01:12:48,080 --> 01:12:52,000
- She's pulling you to her level.
- I won't listen to this.

685
01:12:52,080 --> 01:12:55,240
Then listen to this.
You tried your way and messed up.

686
01:12:55,320 --> 01:12:59,360
Now try our way. No more beach
friends and no more harebrained jobs.

687
01:12:59,440 --> 01:13:01,880
- Understand?
- Yes. But no promises.

688
01:13:01,960 --> 01:13:05,040
If you stay in my house,
you'll go along with it.

689
01:13:05,120 --> 01:13:07,320
You just made the decision for me.

690
01:13:09,640 --> 01:13:14,680
Chadwick! Think of who you are.
You come from a fine family.

691
01:13:14,760 --> 01:13:17,880
You'll do enough remembering
for both of us, Mom.

692
01:13:18,920 --> 01:13:23,480
Oh, Daddy!
What did we do wrong?

693
01:13:23,560 --> 01:13:25,920
Offhand, I'd say we got married.

694
01:13:46,720 --> 01:13:49,480
- How do you like being unemployed?
- I don't.

695
01:13:49,560 --> 01:13:52,200
- How would you like to be married?
- You asking?

696
01:13:52,280 --> 01:13:56,360
Not till I know what the answer is.
One more setback and it's a record.

697
01:13:56,440 --> 01:14:00,160
First man to lose a home, a family,
a job and a girl in one day.

698
01:14:00,240 --> 01:14:05,240
You were right in what you did.
Chad, don't quit. Bounce right back.

699
01:14:05,600 --> 01:14:09,560
- There's so much you can do.
- Yeah. I can be a tourist guide.

700
01:14:09,640 --> 01:14:13,680
Miss Prentace thought you were good.
I saw her at the office.

701
01:14:13,760 --> 01:14:17,040
She really blasted
Mr Chapman for firing you.

702
01:14:17,120 --> 01:14:20,760
She cancelled the rest of her tour.
She thinks a lot of you.

703
01:14:21,960 --> 01:14:25,640
I'm sorry about the tour.
I think she was enjoying herself.

704
01:14:25,720 --> 01:14:29,800
- I know she was.
- Is she taking the girls home?

705
01:14:29,880 --> 01:14:32,000
Unless she goes to another guide.

706
01:14:32,080 --> 01:14:35,000
But I'm more concerned
about your plans.

707
01:14:35,080 --> 01:14:37,200
- You're a wonderful girl!
- I am?

708
01:14:37,280 --> 01:14:41,080
- And pretty! And got a brain.
- I'm so glad I was able to help.

709
01:14:41,160 --> 01:14:43,800
- Take care of my board!
- Where are you going?

710
01:14:43,880 --> 01:14:45,840
To see Miss Prentace.

711
01:14:48,520 --> 01:14:51,640
We agreed to continue the tour.
If you'll follow through.

712
01:14:51,720 --> 01:14:56,880
"Plane reservations
and hotel accommodations at Kauai. "

713
01:14:56,960 --> 01:14:58,720
I'll do what I can.

714
01:14:58,800 --> 01:15:03,200
By the way, congratulations.
Was she hard to convince?

715
01:15:04,760 --> 01:15:07,120
No. She was all for the idea.

716
01:15:09,840 --> 01:15:12,680
That's right. Three days.

717
01:15:12,760 --> 01:15:16,840
When I come back, we'll celebrate.
Goodbye, honey.

718
01:15:58,760 --> 01:16:00,600
OK, girls, let's go inside.

719
01:16:02,240 --> 01:16:04,200
Follow your luggage.

720
01:16:04,280 --> 01:16:07,120
- It's beautiful.
- Look at the palm trees!

721
01:16:07,200 --> 01:16:09,040
- And the bridge!
- It's nice.

722
01:16:09,120 --> 01:16:10,480
I'm going to like it here.

723
01:16:13,080 --> 01:16:15,920
We'll meet in the lobby
in half an hour, girls.

724
01:16:16,000 --> 01:16:18,240
Beverly, we're rooming together.

725
01:16:18,320 --> 01:16:21,920
Put on your riding clothes.
I'll arrange for the horses.

726
01:18:02,000 --> 01:18:05,760
- This is for dinner.
- I'm starved. I could eat a horse!

727
01:18:05,840 --> 01:18:07,880
Please, make it mine.

728
01:18:07,960 --> 01:18:11,160
- Shall we go in now?
- We have to wait to be called.

729
01:18:11,240 --> 01:18:13,280
Who's gonna call us?

730
01:18:20,640 --> 01:18:25,040
That's the traditional Hawaiian way
of announcing that chow's on.

731
01:19:24,360 --> 01:19:26,320
- Pretty impressive.
- Indeed.

732
01:19:28,000 --> 01:19:30,080
- Shall we, ladies?
- Yes.

733
01:19:30,160 --> 01:19:32,720
Duchess? Dinner is served.

734
01:19:45,120 --> 01:19:48,120
- This one and that one.
- Did you tell Chad you were coming?

735
01:19:48,200 --> 01:19:49,960
No. I want to surprise him.

736
01:19:50,040 --> 01:19:52,560
Are you sure Miss Prentace
is at the same hotel?

737
01:19:52,640 --> 01:19:54,640
I made the reservations myself.

738
01:19:54,720 --> 01:19:57,280
You're as anxious
to get to the hotel as I am.

739
01:19:57,360 --> 01:20:00,320
- I have business there.
- So have I.

740
01:20:50,720 --> 01:20:53,920
- Hi, Chad!
- What do you want?

741
01:20:54,000 --> 01:20:57,920
- Off limits. Back to your room.
- I couldn't sleep there.

742
01:20:59,040 --> 01:21:01,240
You can't sleep here. You...

743
01:21:01,320 --> 01:21:04,000
That perfume!
You ought to take a bath.

744
01:21:04,080 --> 01:21:06,840
On second thought,
take a cold shower.

745
01:21:06,920 --> 01:21:09,320
I'm lonesome.
I want someone to talk to.

746
01:21:09,400 --> 01:21:11,960
- What about your roommates?
- They're sleeping.

747
01:21:12,040 --> 01:21:14,320
That's where you should be - in bed!

748
01:21:14,400 --> 01:21:16,360
I am in bed.

749
01:21:20,280 --> 01:21:24,080
- Hello?
- This is Maile. I just got in.

750
01:21:24,160 --> 01:21:28,440
- Maile. You just got in where?
- Here at the hotel.

751
01:21:28,520 --> 01:21:30,800
I thought it would be a surprise.

752
01:21:30,880 --> 01:21:35,840
Surprise? It is. I mean,
I'm glad you're here.

753
01:21:35,920 --> 01:21:40,960
- Are you receiving visitors?
- I was just getting ready for bed.

754
01:21:41,040 --> 01:21:44,920
- It's been a rough day, I'm tired.
- Am I getting the brush?

755
01:21:49,920 --> 01:21:52,840
No. I'll meet you in the bar
in five minutes.

756
01:21:52,920 --> 01:21:54,720
Well, then. That's better.

757
01:21:56,800 --> 01:21:59,000
At least we have five minutes.

758
01:21:59,080 --> 01:22:01,840
I have five minutes,
Miss oversexed and underaged.

759
01:22:01,920 --> 01:22:03,880
I spent one night in jail cos of you.

760
01:22:03,960 --> 01:22:05,720
- That's when I knew.
- What?

761
01:22:05,800 --> 01:22:09,160
When you fought with Mr Garvey,
I knew you cared.

762
01:22:09,240 --> 01:22:11,200
I wasn't fighting over you.

763
01:22:11,280 --> 01:22:13,880
Don't you think
I'm worth fighting for?

764
01:22:13,960 --> 01:22:16,680
I think you're a mixed-up kid
that's too big for her breeches.

765
01:22:16,760 --> 01:22:18,480
I don't wear breeches.

766
01:22:18,560 --> 01:22:21,680
You're getting out of here,
Miss no-breeches Bardot!

767
01:22:21,760 --> 01:22:25,680
- Chad, do you think I'm pretty?
- I think you're pretty stupid.

768
01:22:25,760 --> 01:22:28,000
Would you rather hold me
than Abigail?

769
01:22:28,080 --> 01:22:31,440
I'd like to hold you
over a barbecue pit.

770
01:22:31,600 --> 01:22:33,520
Who is it?

771
01:22:33,600 --> 01:22:35,240
- Patsy...
- And Sandy!

772
01:22:35,320 --> 01:22:37,480
What is this,
game night at Coco Palms?

773
01:22:37,560 --> 01:22:39,760
We've got to see you.

774
01:22:43,040 --> 01:22:46,040
- What are you doing here?
- We're looking for Ellie.

775
01:22:46,120 --> 01:22:49,400
- This is my room. Out!
- And that's my perfume!

776
01:22:49,480 --> 01:22:51,280
You're ruining my sleep!

777
01:22:51,360 --> 01:22:54,040
- That dirty sneak!
- Who's a dirty sneak?

778
01:22:54,120 --> 01:22:57,040
- You! You stole my perfume!
- And my peignoir!

779
01:22:57,120 --> 01:22:59,760
Keep quiet!
Ellie was just leaving.

780
01:22:59,840 --> 01:23:03,560
- I don't care what she's doing.
- Don't you dare!

781
01:23:03,640 --> 01:23:05,960
Go back to your room.

782
01:23:06,040 --> 01:23:08,320
Go back to your rooms
and settle this.

783
01:23:08,400 --> 01:23:12,160
I trust you'll explain what
you were doing here. Everybody out!

784
01:23:12,240 --> 01:23:16,400
- Yes?
- Abigail Prentace, may I see you?

785
01:23:16,480 --> 01:23:20,280
Just a second.
Girls, in the bed. No, no!

786
01:23:26,960 --> 01:23:29,520
Hello. I hope I didn't disturb you.

787
01:23:29,600 --> 01:23:32,080
I've never been more disturbed
in my life.

788
01:23:32,160 --> 01:23:36,440
This is irregular,
I know, but may I come in?

789
01:23:36,520 --> 01:23:39,920
Sure. Come on in.
We're having open house tonight.

790
01:23:40,000 --> 01:23:44,040
I was so restless,
I went out walking in the moonlight.

791
01:23:44,120 --> 01:23:46,800
Moonlight in Hawaii is intoxicating.

792
01:23:46,880 --> 01:23:49,680
- I know.
- I had to talk to someone!

793
01:23:49,760 --> 01:23:51,560
This is the night for it.

794
01:23:51,640 --> 01:23:56,320
Chad? I'm not as young
as you might think I am. Not old!

795
01:23:56,400 --> 01:24:00,640
But a little older than you. Not
that that should make a difference.

796
01:24:01,680 --> 01:24:03,840
No. It doesn't make any difference.

797
01:24:03,920 --> 01:24:09,760
I've taken a vacation every summer,
looking for, well, romance.

798
01:24:09,840 --> 01:24:12,880
An attractive girl like you
should have no trouble.

799
01:24:12,960 --> 01:24:16,960
Thank you.
I'll get quickly to my point.

800
01:24:17,040 --> 01:24:20,440
When Miss Thackery asked me
to chaperone the girls,

801
01:24:20,520 --> 01:24:22,280
I accepted eagerly.

802
01:24:22,360 --> 01:24:25,760
I thought it would insulate me
against this frustration.

803
01:24:25,840 --> 01:24:31,120
- But instead, Chad, it's happened.
- What's happened?

804
01:24:31,200 --> 01:24:34,360
- I've found romance.
- You have?

805
01:24:57,400 --> 01:24:59,520
I just can't keep it a secret.

806
01:25:03,320 --> 01:25:06,360
- This is most unexpected.
- To me, too, Chad.

807
01:25:07,440 --> 01:25:10,160
- Excuse me.
- Open up!

808
01:25:10,240 --> 01:25:12,400
Ellie's gone! She stole the Jeep!

809
01:25:12,480 --> 01:25:14,840
- What?
- She drove off like a maniac!

810
01:25:14,920 --> 01:25:17,680
- Which way did she go?
- Out the front gate.

811
01:25:17,760 --> 01:25:20,640
Crazy kid. I'll get a car
and see if I can catch her.

812
01:25:20,720 --> 01:25:23,320
She went so fast,
we couldn't stop her.

813
01:26:34,720 --> 01:26:39,000
- Leave me alone! Let me go!
- Stop it, Ellie!

814
01:26:39,080 --> 01:26:41,160
- Let me go!
- I'm trying to help you!

815
01:26:41,240 --> 01:26:45,800
- Let go! Let go of me!
- Stop it!

816
01:26:48,640 --> 01:26:50,600
Listen, Ellie.

817
01:26:52,080 --> 01:26:55,680
- Stop this! Stop it!
- Why did you have to stop me?

818
01:26:55,760 --> 01:27:00,240
Nobody cares about me.
Whether I live or die.

819
01:27:00,320 --> 01:27:03,920
Nobody seems to care because you
don't seem to care about yourself.

820
01:27:04,000 --> 01:27:06,840
If you like yourself,
others will, too.

821
01:27:06,920 --> 01:27:08,720
There's nothing to like.

822
01:27:08,800 --> 01:27:11,680
There is if you don't try to be
something you're not.

823
01:27:11,760 --> 01:27:16,320
It don't work. You better find out
now and save yourself a lot of grief.

824
01:27:17,200 --> 01:27:20,440
- Everybody hates me.
- Nobody hates you.

825
01:27:20,520 --> 01:27:24,520
No? Then why do my parents
always send me away -

826
01:27:24,600 --> 01:27:28,080
to school all year,
on trips every summer?

827
01:27:28,160 --> 01:27:31,960
And you... You threw me
out of your room.

828
01:27:32,040 --> 01:27:34,240
You didn't throw Abigail out.

829
01:27:34,320 --> 01:27:37,320
Do you know what you need?
A good spanking.

830
01:27:38,640 --> 01:27:44,680
Maybe I do. Nobody ever cared
enough about me. Even for that.

831
01:27:45,080 --> 01:27:48,720
All right. If that will prove
that somebody does care...

832
01:27:48,800 --> 01:27:52,600
- You wouldn't dare!
- Wouldn't I dare?

833
01:27:52,680 --> 01:27:56,040
I got a feeling this will
make both of us feel a lot better.

834
01:27:58,400 --> 01:28:00,360
These hot cakes are good.

835
01:28:00,440 --> 01:28:03,320
- Pass the guava jelly, please.
- Here, Bev.

836
01:28:03,400 --> 01:28:06,680
- Thank you.
- Gesundheit.

837
01:28:06,760 --> 01:28:11,000
See how many friends you got.
Sneeze and count the gesundheits.

838
01:28:11,080 --> 01:28:13,240
Hope you didn't catch a head-cold.

839
01:28:13,320 --> 01:28:16,160
No, ma'am. Just the opposite.

840
01:28:17,040 --> 01:28:20,400
You haven't touched
your breakfast. Aren't you hungry?

841
01:28:20,480 --> 01:28:24,680
- I don't have much of an appetite.
- Are you feeling all right?

842
01:28:24,760 --> 01:28:29,000
As a matter of fact, I'm not.
I didn't sleep very well last night.

843
01:28:29,080 --> 01:28:31,040
I had a restless night myself.

844
01:28:31,120 --> 01:28:34,320
You should get some rest
instead of coming riding.

845
01:28:37,880 --> 01:28:41,320
We'll meet out front in 20 minutes,
and don't be late.

846
01:28:42,400 --> 01:28:44,360
We'll be there. We promise.

847
01:28:44,440 --> 01:28:48,680
- Chad, I'd like to talk to you.
- About last night?

848
01:28:48,760 --> 01:28:51,880
Yes. I didn't finish
what I was telling you.

849
01:28:51,960 --> 01:28:55,400
I'm not the guy you think I am.
I snore and everything.

850
01:29:01,760 --> 01:29:04,120
Abbie! I've been looking
all over for you.

851
01:29:04,200 --> 01:29:06,560
I didn't want
to disturb you last night.

852
01:29:06,640 --> 01:29:09,200
This is what
I've been trying to tell you.

853
01:29:09,280 --> 01:29:11,320
- You mean you and Jack?
- Yes!

854
01:29:11,400 --> 01:29:13,440
Congratulations! Both of you!

855
01:29:13,520 --> 01:29:15,320
- Thanks.
- It's great.

856
01:29:15,400 --> 01:29:19,080
I got my girl, but you've got
a few things to straighten out.

857
01:29:19,160 --> 01:29:22,400
- Where?
- She was headed for her bungalow.

858
01:29:22,480 --> 01:29:27,040
- I missed you.
- You don't know how great it is!

859
01:29:27,120 --> 01:29:30,120
He's a nice boy.
I hope things work out for him.

860
01:29:30,200 --> 01:29:33,000
He'll have to take care
of his girl himself.

861
01:29:33,080 --> 01:29:36,120
Maybe I can give him a hand
with his other problem.

862
01:29:36,200 --> 01:29:39,400
Operator. You look wonderful.

863
01:29:39,480 --> 01:29:41,840
Operator,
get me Mr Fred Gates on Oahu.

864
01:29:41,920 --> 01:29:44,400
Great Southern
Hawaiian Fruit Company.

865
01:29:52,320 --> 01:29:54,280
Hi, honey!

866
01:29:58,960 --> 01:30:01,280
You're in the wrong room,
lover boy.

867
01:30:01,360 --> 01:30:04,280
I'm sorry about last night.
I got tied up...

868
01:30:04,360 --> 01:30:06,320
With Miss Prentace! I saw you.

869
01:30:06,400 --> 01:30:10,320
I could explain what happened,
but nobody would believe me.

870
01:30:10,400 --> 01:30:13,920
I love you. There's nothing
between Miss Prentace and me.

871
01:30:14,000 --> 01:30:17,440
Of course you deny it. But I know
that look, and she's got it.

872
01:30:17,520 --> 01:30:20,320
That look is for Jack.
He's got it, too.

873
01:30:20,400 --> 01:30:25,120
Mr Kelman and Miss Prentace?
You can do better than that.

874
01:30:25,200 --> 01:30:27,160
You must think I'm a fool!

875
01:30:27,240 --> 01:30:30,720
- Look, Maile...
- Don't touch me! Get out!

876
01:30:30,800 --> 01:30:35,280
- Men! You can have them!
- I don't want them! I want you!

877
01:31:00,720 --> 01:31:03,120
- Lonnie, three mai tais.
- Yes, sir.

878
01:31:03,200 --> 01:31:05,520
- What are you doing here?
- Hello, Son.

879
01:31:05,600 --> 01:31:08,040
It's time you two got things settled.

880
01:31:08,120 --> 01:31:10,480
- Settled?!
- Sit down.

881
01:31:10,560 --> 01:31:14,640
You mean you dragged
me all the way over here just...

882
01:31:14,720 --> 01:31:17,800
- Why are you here anyway?
- I'm here on business.

883
01:31:17,880 --> 01:31:20,640
That's a welcome change.
What kind of business?

884
01:31:20,720 --> 01:31:24,520
Dad, you've wanted me to work
for the company. Do you still?

885
01:31:24,600 --> 01:31:27,600
Yes. Your mother and I
both want that very much.

886
01:31:27,680 --> 01:31:30,320
- Jack?
- Nothing would suit me better.

887
01:31:30,400 --> 01:31:32,360
That leaves me. What do I want?

888
01:31:32,440 --> 01:31:35,280
I want independence,
a chance to stand on my own,

889
01:31:35,360 --> 01:31:38,160
which seems to rule out
working for the company.

890
01:31:39,400 --> 01:31:44,560
But I figured a way to do both.
Work for the company and Chad Gates.

891
01:31:44,640 --> 01:31:48,360
- How many salesmen do you have?
- 317.

892
01:31:48,440 --> 01:31:51,480
- Scattered all over the States?
- And Canada.

893
01:31:51,560 --> 01:31:55,120
Every year you have an annual
sales meeting in Atlanta.

894
01:31:55,200 --> 01:31:58,720
Have you ever thought of how much
they'd enjoy a trip to Hawaii?

895
01:31:58,800 --> 01:32:03,360
Bring 'em here, show them how we
do things, get some Hawaiian sunshine

896
01:32:03,440 --> 01:32:06,520
and they'd go back and sell
like never before.

897
01:32:06,600 --> 01:32:10,000
- I think he's got something.
- And incentive trips.

898
01:32:10,080 --> 01:32:13,760
Any salesman who goes over his quota
gets a holiday here.

899
01:32:13,840 --> 01:32:17,080
That's a crackerjack notion.
I'll put you in charge.

900
01:32:17,160 --> 01:32:21,320
No. I wanna go in business
with Maile. That's my independence.

901
01:32:21,400 --> 01:32:23,360
I wondered where I fit in.

902
01:32:23,440 --> 01:32:25,800
- Maile, sit down.
- Hello, Maile.

903
01:32:25,880 --> 01:32:28,280
I'm giving Great Southern this idea.

904
01:32:28,360 --> 01:32:31,160
I expect them to give us
the tourist business.

905
01:32:31,240 --> 01:32:33,840
My partner will figure
out the costs, OK?

906
01:32:33,920 --> 01:32:37,880
- You've got a deal.
- Chad, I'm proud of you.

907
01:32:37,960 --> 01:32:41,920
Lonnie, four of those little
tummy-warmers over here.

908
01:32:42,000 --> 01:32:44,920
- How do you feel, partner?
- Proud and happy.

909
01:32:45,000 --> 01:32:48,520
"Gates and Duval Travel Service. "
Has a nice ring to it.

910
01:32:48,600 --> 01:32:51,400
It's too long. Simple.
"Gates of Hawaii. "

911
01:32:51,480 --> 01:32:54,360
- Don't I get any billing?
- Gates is plural.

912
01:32:54,440 --> 01:32:58,400
In case you didn't know, that's a
proposal, and that has a better ring.

913
01:32:58,480 --> 01:33:00,440
You're sure?

914
01:33:00,520 --> 01:33:03,480
I could be romantic about it,
but you'd say yes anyway.

915
01:33:03,560 --> 01:33:06,720
- You're pretty sure of yourself.
- Isn't it about time?

916
01:33:10,440 --> 01:33:14,920
- Mr Gate on line for you.
- Merci beaucoup, Ping Pong.

917
01:33:16,360 --> 01:33:18,320
Hello? Hello, Daddy?

918
01:33:18,400 --> 01:33:21,400
Pack your things.
You're coming over to Kauai!

919
01:33:21,480 --> 01:33:26,200
- Kauai? What on earth for?
- Don't argue with me, Sarah Lee!

920
01:33:26,280 --> 01:33:30,840
You better hurry over here
or you'll miss your son's wedding.

921
01:33:30,920 --> 01:33:33,160
Hello? Hello?

922
01:33:36,960 --> 01:33:41,360
Everything OK, Mr Gate. Missy Gate
just taking nap, s'il vous plait.

923
01:33:45,240 --> 01:33:48,840
And did you know that
my daughter-in-law is of royal blood?

924
01:33:48,920 --> 01:33:52,320
She's a descendent
of King Kalaniopoopoo of Hawaii.

925
01:33:52,400 --> 01:33:56,240
- Kalaneaupuhuu.
- Yes. Our southernmost island.

926
01:33:56,320 --> 01:34:00,240
- Yes, I know. I am her grandmother.
- Here they come.
