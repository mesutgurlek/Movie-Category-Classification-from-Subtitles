1
00:00:24,841 --> 00:00:28,312
The One Man Band

2
00:04:17,800 --> 00:04:23,160
How can you dare to be first!
I want to be first!

3
00:04:23,160 --> 00:04:24,440
Me, too.

4
00:04:24,440 --> 00:04:25,320
What?

5
00:04:25,320 --> 00:04:27,120
I said, I also want to be first.

6
00:04:27,120 --> 00:04:29,080
But Monsieur, I am in my street.

7
00:04:29,080 --> 00:04:31,800
I have the right to be first in my street.
You are not in your street, are you?

8
00:04:31,800 --> 00:04:32,720
No.

9
00:04:32,720 --> 00:04:34,720
So go to your street where you can be first.

10
00:04:34,720 --> 00:04:36,160
You are right.

11
00:04:36,160 --> 00:04:37,880
This way we can both be first!

12
00:04:37,880 --> 00:04:39,040
Good.

13
00:04:39,040 --> 00:04:43,280
And you don't move.
Not before I have left!

14
00:04:43,280 --> 00:04:45,360
Much later!

15
00:06:00,600 --> 00:06:03,000
Be quiet!
We start from the beginning...

16
00:06:03,000 --> 00:06:03,840
No, it's finished!

17
00:06:03,840 --> 00:06:06,480
We've been working on it for over a month.
-I don't care. -Ok. You can leave...

18
00:06:06,480 --> 00:06:07,840
No! Stay!

19
00:06:10,480 --> 00:06:12,000
Hello uncle. How are you?

20
00:06:12,000 --> 00:06:14,200
No time! What am I thinking?
Quick! Telepathy!

21
00:06:14,200 --> 00:06:16,640
But it is wonderful
what you are thinking...

22
00:06:16,640 --> 00:06:18,640
Do you hear what I am thinking?
Listen!

23
00:07:20,960 --> 00:07:26,040
Look at me! Chatterboxes...

24
00:07:26,040 --> 00:07:28,320
Take your positions!
To your positions, you two!

25
00:07:32,920 --> 00:07:39,600
And keep your mouth shut!

26
00:08:42,800 --> 00:08:44,680
Listen to me girls...

27
00:08:44,680 --> 00:08:45,880
Listen to me girls!

28
00:08:45,880 --> 00:08:47,440
Listen to me girls!!

29
00:08:47,440 --> 00:08:49,920
And keep your mouth shut!

30
00:09:07,360 --> 00:09:09,640
5...6...7

31
00:09:39,880 --> 00:09:43,200
That wasn't bad.
Do that once again immediately. 5, 6, 7!

32
00:09:53,840 --> 00:10:03,120
That was nice... There's more power to it.
Again. Give it all you have... Go on, 5, 6, 7!

33
00:10:10,800 --> 00:10:13,000
That was good! That was very good.

34
00:10:13,000 --> 00:10:15,320
You are not too tired? Not too much?
You can have a break...

35
00:10:15,320 --> 00:10:20,200
But first we do that once again.
The last time. Go on, 5, 6, 7

36
00:11:09,040 --> 00:11:13,360
Mr. Evans, one month before the tour this is
terrible! We must replace her immediately.

37
00:11:15,640 --> 00:11:19,840
Listen, guys.
You have cut off my head.

38
00:11:47,240 --> 00:11:48,440
That's enough!

39
00:11:52,320 --> 00:11:56,280
Well, good... Next one!
Thank you.

40
00:12:17,880 --> 00:12:21,360
Well, bad. That was bad. Er, well, not bad.
That wasn't bad...

41
00:12:32,760 --> 00:12:34,160
What do you think about that?

42
00:12:43,600 --> 00:12:46,960
And you?
-No, I think he's right.

43
00:12:49,400 --> 00:12:53,840
Well, that wasn't bad.
Not bad at all. That was very good.

44
00:12:56,600 --> 00:12:58,360
Next one, please.

45
00:12:58,880 --> 00:13:01,960
What is that!!

46
00:13:01,960 --> 00:13:10,840
No... no... no! I don't want her!
I don't want her! Leave! Leave!

47
00:13:10,840 --> 00:13:14,360
Who invited that one?
Who invited that one?

48
00:13:45,960 --> 00:13:47,480
What's her name?
- What?

49
00:13:47,480 --> 00:13:48,240
What is her name?

50
00:13:48,240 --> 00:13:49,360
Who?

51
00:13:49,360 --> 00:13:51,320
What is your name?

52
00:13:51,369 --> 00:13:53,041
Hendrikje Schimmelpenninck.

53
00:13:54,040 --> 00:13:55,720
Write it down!

54
00:13:55,720 --> 00:13:57,240
What?

55
00:13:57,240 --> 00:13:59,280
Write!

56
00:13:59,280 --> 00:14:00,240
Where?

57
00:14:05,600 --> 00:14:08,280
Now do that once again.

58
00:14:35,280 --> 00:14:39,160
Did you see her dance?
Did you see how she moved?

59
00:14:39,160 --> 00:14:41,520
No...

60
00:14:41,520 --> 00:14:47,600
Oh, you did not see it...I saw it! In here!
It happened in here. Telepathy!

61
00:14:53,880 --> 00:14:56,160
That wasn't bad.
Where did you work before?

62
00:14:56,160 --> 00:14:58,640
In Rome. With Andrejev.

63
00:14:58,640 --> 00:15:02,320
Oh la la. And after that?
-In Madrid, with Barabanov.

64
00:15:02,320 --> 00:15:05,720
Oh the poor old. He's still alive?
And after that?

65
00:15:05,760 --> 00:15:10,520
In London. With Nevelevski.
-Nevelevski? He's also still alive...

66
00:15:11,040 --> 00:15:13,560
Well, that's all too classic,
but you've got the job.

67
00:15:14,720 --> 00:15:18,080
But be careful! Here we don't have
boyfriends, marriages or anything like that!

68
00:15:18,080 --> 00:15:23,960
This is like a monastery. You replace a girl
who wanted to get married and had to leave!

69
00:15:23,960 --> 00:15:26,520
Did you get that?
- Yes, Monsieur!

70
00:15:26,520 --> 00:15:28,680
Good. And now let's start working.

71
00:15:30,358 --> 00:15:32,317
Private property.
No men allowed.

72
00:16:42,160 --> 00:16:48,880
Listen carefully. If a man approaches you,
no talk, no discussion. Counterattack!

73
00:16:49,240 --> 00:16:51,520
Philippe, demonstration please!

74
00:16:55,080 --> 00:17:01,080
Look at me, Hendrika. I am you. Philippe is
the man who wants... which is not allowed.

75
00:17:01,080 --> 00:17:03,120
Go!

76
00:17:12,560 --> 00:17:16,400
Did you see? Now you, Hendrika.
Get up, Philippe!

77
00:17:34,360 --> 00:17:36,880
That's even better! Go...

78
00:17:41,760 --> 00:17:43,320
Very good.

79
00:17:46,480 --> 00:17:48,520
Well that's...Get up!

80
00:18:47,200 --> 00:18:48,720
Fifty.

81
00:18:51,280 --> 00:18:54,440
Not this way. Here...
Take off your glasses.

82
00:18:57,480 --> 00:19:01,120
Fifty, two hundred.
Very good.

83
00:19:02,200 --> 00:19:05,080
Forty-nine.

84
00:19:13,120 --> 00:19:16,360
Fifty, one hundred.

85
00:19:19,680 --> 00:19:22,600
Forty-eight.
- That's good...

86
00:19:23,720 --> 00:19:25,760
Fifty-two, five hundred.

87
00:19:41,520 --> 00:19:46,000
Faster! That's how to get rid of the fat.

88
00:19:48,040 --> 00:19:49,840
Fifty.

89
00:19:59,480 --> 00:20:02,840
What's going on? I can't hear anything.
What's wrong?

90
00:20:06,600 --> 00:20:08,920
The scales don't work?
- Yes, they do...

91
00:20:08,680 --> 00:20:13,240
How much is it then?
- Forty-five!

92
00:20:13,240 --> 00:20:15,440
Very good.

93
00:20:17,960 --> 00:20:20,640
No, that's not necessary...

94
00:20:39,880 --> 00:20:44,160
My dear Françoise.
Discipline is everything, isn't it?

95
00:20:44,160 --> 00:20:46,840
A little bit of carrot, a little tomato...

96
00:20:52,120 --> 00:20:58,160
Don't sleep! Your face will stay like that.
Your plate, please... That's enough.

97
00:21:01,400 --> 00:21:04,360
Ah, Leila... What's wrong?

98
00:21:17,920 --> 00:21:19,680
Where's the rice?

99
00:21:26,560 --> 00:21:28,560
A little bit of quince jam...

100
00:21:34,800 --> 00:21:39,600
It's nothing, put on your glasses.
Give me your plate.

101
00:21:43,160 --> 00:21:46,080
Don't look at it, you will taste it!

102
00:21:50,640 --> 00:21:55,760
Your plate.
No, you don't need rice!

103
00:22:00,680 --> 00:22:03,040
Mr. Evans. Are you satisfied with me?

104
00:22:03,040 --> 00:22:05,200
I'm very satisfied with you.

105
00:22:05,200 --> 00:22:08,640
Do I dance better now?
- Much better, Hendrika.

106
00:22:08,640 --> 00:22:10,280
With you I made such progress.

107
00:22:10,280 --> 00:22:14,360
That's very nice of you, my little Hendrika.
Very nice.

108
00:22:14,360 --> 00:22:16,800
Could I also have a little bit of the rice?

109
00:22:16,800 --> 00:22:21,520
Certainly, my little Hendrika. Give me your plate.

110
00:22:22,880 --> 00:22:24,800
A little bit more, please?

111
00:22:25,960 --> 00:22:27,120
Yes. And also a bit of quince jam?

112
00:22:27,120 --> 00:22:27,960
Oh yes!

113
00:22:32,160 --> 00:22:34,520
Thanks.

114
00:22:35,720 --> 00:22:37,560
Well, you feel better now?
- Yes, Monsieur.

115
00:22:39,240 --> 00:22:42,440
Then you can take some medicine.
In front of me!

116
00:22:53,196 --> 00:22:54,775
You get the same dose. Go!

117
00:23:10,960 --> 00:23:15,080
Private property.
No men allowed.

118
00:23:15,080 --> 00:23:19,800
Before you go to bed, I will tell you
the story of the wolf and the lamb.

119
00:23:24,920 --> 00:23:32,800
Don't pull your nose! It will stay like that!
I told you before.

120
00:23:32,800 --> 00:23:34,400
Let's go on...

121
00:25:30,000 --> 00:25:32,120
And what happened after that?

122
00:25:32,120 --> 00:25:33,720
They married?

123
00:25:34,000 --> 00:25:38,960
Go to bed. You did not understand anything...

124
00:26:28,760 --> 00:26:34,440
Dancing, that's my life. I'm so happy
to dance. I don't like men.

125
00:26:35,240 --> 00:26:43,880
Dancing, dancing...
No men! Never any men!

126
00:27:28,040 --> 00:27:30,040
Philippe.
- Who is it?

127
00:27:30,040 --> 00:27:31,560
It's me, open!
- No, it's not you!

128
00:27:31,560 --> 00:27:33,400
It certainly is me!
- No, it's not you.

129
00:27:33,400 --> 00:27:35,320
But I tell you, it's me.
- Prove it!

130
00:27:35,320 --> 00:27:38,720
How can I prove it?
- Sing the song of the latest ballet!

131
00:27:44,360 --> 00:27:46,040
It's Françoise's head.

132
00:27:47,200 --> 00:27:49,840
Non, it's not really the head of Françoise.
Open! Open!

133
00:27:49,840 --> 00:27:51,880
She has left. She's no longer in her room.
- What?

134
00:27:51,880 --> 00:27:53,440
Get dressed, we'll leave!

135
00:28:43,640 --> 00:28:50,720
She mustn't see us! No matter what!
We hide behind the bus.

136
00:29:09,800 --> 00:29:11,960
It's nothing. Go on. It's nothing.

137
00:29:11,960 --> 00:29:14,280
What do you mean, nothing?
And this? And that?

138
00:29:14,280 --> 00:29:15,960
That's nothing! Absolutely nothing...

139
00:29:15,960 --> 00:29:19,600
This is nothing? -No! Nothing
-And he? He has nothing?

140
00:29:19,600 --> 00:29:21,320
No! - I've got nothing.

141
00:29:21,320 --> 00:29:24,040
Well, you don't want me to
bring you to a garage?

142
00:29:24,040 --> 00:29:27,000
The car runs fine. It's you that keeps
me from going... The car is fine.

143
00:29:27,000 --> 00:29:31,000
Ah, it's me... I apologise for having
had to brake, Monsieur.

144
00:29:33,120 --> 00:29:35,760
Don't go, Madam. There is NOTHING!
We drive on now...

145
00:29:35,760 --> 00:29:38,920
No, thanks. I am almost there.
- Ok.

146
00:31:46,400 --> 00:31:50,320
Finally a young one. I take you to Paris.
You are a beau.

147
00:32:05,200 --> 00:32:09,360
I will introduce you to my friends.

148
00:32:37,520 --> 00:32:41,400
There's no need to be so shy.
Come back...

149
00:33:08,800 --> 00:33:13,760
We have to make up our minds, Françoise.
Do you want to marry me?

150
00:33:13,760 --> 00:33:16,840
Give me a little bit more
time to think about it.

151
00:33:16,840 --> 00:33:22,840
But I will leave in two days. I need an
answer before that, my beloved Françoise.

152
00:33:22,840 --> 00:33:26,640
But Evans. The ballet, the tour.
I can't leave that easily.

153
00:33:26,640 --> 00:33:32,680
Yes, I understand. I will wait for you.

154
00:33:32,680 --> 00:33:34,640
I will give you a call in two days.

155
00:33:34,640 --> 00:33:39,400
I hope it will be a yes.
-  So do I.

156
00:34:11,480 --> 00:34:13,200
It's me. It's me.
- What's going on?

157
00:34:13,200 --> 00:34:16,880
You'll never believe me.
You'll never believe me.

158
00:34:16,880 --> 00:34:21,600
We thought Françoise was leaving. But you
know what they were discussing? - No.

159
00:34:21,600 --> 00:34:23,800
Only about you!
- Me?

160
00:34:23,800 --> 00:34:26,960
There were only talking about you.

161
00:34:26,960 --> 00:34:33,240
I almost fell into the water. She said:
"I love Philippe but I don't dare to tell him".

162
00:34:33,240 --> 00:34:41,840
That's impossible.
-He said: "You have to tell him! Don't hide your feelings."
And I kept on swinging to and thro...

163
00:34:41,840 --> 00:34:48,240
That's impossible.
-There were talking about that all night long. Till four o'clock.
I spend all the night swinging...

164
00:34:48,240 --> 00:34:51,240
What do you say?
- That's unbelievable!

165
00:34:51,240 --> 00:34:57,160
But listen. If she comes into your room: out!
And you never think about her. Never!

166
00:34:57,160 --> 00:35:03,680
I have your word? - Yes.
- Look at me. Can I count on you? - Yes.

167
00:35:03,680 --> 00:35:09,600
Yes, I can trust you...
Everything will be fine.

168
00:35:18,800 --> 00:35:25,440
That's incredible...

169
00:36:08,200 --> 00:36:15,000
Françoise... I...
- What's wrong with you?

170
00:36:16,680 --> 00:36:19,760
I... I wrote a song for you.
Can I sing it for you?

171
00:36:20,720 --> 00:36:22,400
In my room, tonight.

172
00:36:23,240 --> 00:36:26,040
Tonight?
- If Evans doesn't see us, there's no problem.

173
00:36:46,400 --> 00:36:51,960
Françoise... finally...
- What's wrong with you?

174
00:36:53,240 --> 00:37:02,480
I have forgotten the lyrics
of my song for you...

175
00:37:02,480 --> 00:37:09,240
Relax, relax.
Loosen up.

176
00:37:09,240 --> 00:37:15,800
This is a song... a song that...
a song which...

177
00:37:15,800 --> 00:37:20,040
A song that what?

178
00:37:20,040 --> 00:37:24,480
I have your... but I have time...

179
00:37:24,480 --> 00:37:31,920
That's nice.. - To tell you in my song...
- That's the emotion...

180
00:37:31,920 --> 00:37:33,640
At last, Françoise...
What I wanted to tell you...

181
00:37:33,640 --> 00:37:39,440
Wait! Wait... wait....

182
00:38:49,600 --> 00:38:58,440
I remember the lyrics of my song...
- What good is it now?

183
00:38:58,440 --> 00:39:07,200
At the end of my song I tell you...
- That you love me.

184
00:39:13,720 --> 00:39:20,880
What's happening? Why are you here?
What are you doing in Françoises room?

185
00:39:20,880 --> 00:39:23,200
Calm down! You know better...

186
00:39:26,360 --> 00:39:35,040
It's fun to mock me. You think I am an idiot.
- No... Wait for me... wait...

187
00:39:35,040 --> 00:39:44,280
Women are not easy. The right time, place...
- And I missed both!? I understand now...

188
00:39:44,280 --> 00:39:49,080
No, you don't understand women at all!
- I tell you I do.

189
00:39:49,080 --> 00:39:57,240
The girls played a nasty trick on Françoise.
You'll have to talk to her alone.

190
00:39:57,240 --> 00:40:00,960
How?
- I have an idea. Call her on the phone.

191
00:40:00,960 --> 00:40:08,520
On the phone?
- That way nobody can listen... Go!

192
00:40:25,360 --> 00:40:30,440
Françoise, I dreamt many times of you...

193
00:40:44,360 --> 00:40:50,080
You again? - I had to call you. In front of you
I lose my self-control. I want to tell you...

194
00:40:50,080 --> 00:40:54,600
You can't be serious.
I'm tired... Good night.

195
00:41:05,440 --> 00:41:07,800
Françoise, I love you.

196
00:41:10,000 --> 00:41:12,360
Did you call Françoise?

197
00:41:14,160 --> 00:41:21,120
I woke her up. She treated me like a child.
- That's the mother in her. She loves you!

198
00:41:21,120 --> 00:41:24,040
Call her again. Go!

199
00:41:35,160 --> 00:41:43,400
I know how women are. I know you love me.
- That's enough! - But Françoise, I love you!

200
00:41:43,400 --> 00:41:50,640
Stop bugging me. - But I have to tell you...
- And I have nothing to tell you.

201
00:41:50,640 --> 00:41:55,720
Stop annoying me. It's no longer funny.

202
00:42:07,280 --> 00:42:12,360
Very good... perfect!

203
00:42:35,000 --> 00:42:44,240
Mr. Franco Budsoni? - Speaking.
- A phone call from Françoise Aumartin.

204
00:42:46,840 --> 00:42:50,760
Ah, Françoise, what a nice surprise.

205
00:42:55,200 --> 00:43:00,200
Yes, I can hear you.
I've been thinking about you all the time...

206
00:43:01,040 --> 00:43:07,440
And I have nothing to tell you.
Stop annoying me. - What?

207
00:43:10,960 --> 00:43:16,120
But Françoise, remember
what you told me...

208
00:43:24,320 --> 00:43:26,120
Are you crying?

209
00:43:31,080 --> 00:43:38,880
Sure, you're sad... Please, remember. 
I asked you to marry me.

210
00:43:40,720 --> 00:43:42,840
It doesn't work.

211
00:43:45,880 --> 00:43:49,640
Stop talking like that.
It's no longer funny.

212
00:44:08,560 --> 00:44:11,880
Idiot.

213
00:46:01,920 --> 00:46:10,600
What's that. Where's the manager?
Did you see that?

214
00:46:10,600 --> 00:46:14,920
Pedro. Look. He's already downstairs.

215
00:46:14,920 --> 00:46:20,400
According to our contract
there are only women allowed as staff.

216
00:46:20,400 --> 00:46:22,600
But he has fourteen children.

217
00:46:22,600 --> 00:46:24,600
And you think that's reassuring?

218
00:46:24,600 --> 00:46:33,000
I will find someone else in a few days...
- I will leave.

219
00:46:33,000 --> 00:46:40,480
And I booked the whole floor.
Who's singing here all the time?

220
00:46:40,480 --> 00:46:50,920
I'll replace him with an old mute woman.
- You must be joking. I will leave...

221
00:46:52,280 --> 00:46:55,600
There he is again. He went over there.

222
00:46:55,600 --> 00:46:59,760
He's already over there...

223
00:46:59,760 --> 00:47:06,080
The girls are here. What will they think?
No men, only women... once and for all!

224
00:47:06,080 --> 00:47:10,760
Have a look at this: here's a lady.

225
00:47:16,600 --> 00:47:25,960
Beautiful... How beautiful.
That is....enormous!

226
00:47:23,520 --> 00:47:29,640
It had to be like that. I made it myself.

227
00:47:34,560 --> 00:47:37,480
Ah yes, it looks similar to you...

228
00:47:37,480 --> 00:47:47,240
Come over here girls and have a look
This man created it. Nice, isn't it?

229
00:49:32,880 --> 00:49:38,440
But sisters! My sisters! What is that, sister?
These are sisters!

230
00:50:34,720 --> 00:50:43,200
When I started working in Rome, I met
this guy. Then... it's difficult to explain...

231
00:50:43,200 --> 00:50:47,840
I understand.

232
00:50:51,520 --> 00:50:54,520
Mr. Evans is wrong.
He can't protect us from men.

233
00:50:55,040 --> 00:50:59,280
What happens if he finds out?
And I have to get the baby tomorrow.

234
00:50:59,280 --> 00:51:13,280
If you take it with you, our tour is in danger.
But I have an idea. Put it in Mr. Evans' room.

235
00:53:20,920 --> 00:53:32,600
Do the birds for me.
That helps. I feel better now.

236
00:53:42,240 --> 00:53:44,240
Quick! Evans is here.

237
00:54:57,400 --> 00:55:14,920
We entrust you with our boy, the result of
your nephew's trip to Rome. That bastard!

238
00:55:17,080 --> 00:55:21,040
Yes. One moment. Don't come in.

239
00:55:21,040 --> 00:55:23,720
What is that?
- Your tea, sir.

240
00:55:23,720 --> 00:55:35,560
Go away. Do the birds for me!
Now go away.

241
00:55:50,800 --> 00:55:56,480
Stop crying. I will call your father.

242
00:56:01,840 --> 00:56:07,960
Philippe, come over here, please.
No, it's nothing at all.

243
00:56:24,480 --> 00:56:28,560
Is that you, Philippe? Come in!

244
00:56:31,280 --> 00:56:33,920
But what's that?
- A little baby.

245
00:56:33,920 --> 00:56:39,560
A girl?
- No, a little boy.

246
00:56:39,560 --> 00:56:50,880
It's your son.
Read this! Is it true?

247
00:56:54,240 --> 00:56:56,080
True or not?

248
00:56:56,480 --> 00:56:59,880
So it's true!

249
00:57:04,960 --> 00:57:10,640
You have left your child!
Do you know what that means?

250
00:57:10,640 --> 00:57:15,480
You could be sent to prison!
How could you do that?

251
00:57:15,480 --> 00:57:19,080
It was not very difficult...

252
00:57:19,080 --> 00:57:23,440
Don't you try to
be funny with me! Now tell me!

253
00:57:23,440 --> 00:57:29,880
During our last tour, I met a girl in Rome.
-How scandalous! - A Sicilian girl.

254
00:57:29,880 --> 00:57:37,080
A Sicilian! Didn't you think about me?
- At that moment... not really.

255
00:57:37,080 --> 00:57:48,840
I don't deserve this. You are a scoundrel.
A rascal. You've dishonoured and ruined us.

256
00:57:48,840 --> 00:57:55,720
The girls must not hear this. It would
ruin the ballet. We have to keep it a secret.

257
00:57:55,720 --> 00:58:01,160
We keep the child until we find the mother.
- Its mother? What for?

258
00:58:01,160 --> 00:58:08,560
Because you will marry her. That will fix it.
-Oh no!

259
00:58:10,400 --> 00:58:19,040
Now we need diapers. Phone off the hook.
The baby must not be disturbed.

260
00:58:39,800 --> 00:58:41,960
I am not here.

261
00:58:49,960 --> 00:58:55,240
My key. I don't want anybody in my room.
My bed and my room are done. - Thank you

262
00:58:55,240 --> 00:58:59,680
I have a headache.

263
00:58:59,680 --> 00:59:03,600
You have a headache? Better sit down.
- He has nothing at all. He's a liar... I need...

264
00:59:03,600 --> 00:59:09,280
I think I feel ill...
- You'd better sit down.

265
00:59:10,800 --> 00:59:15,560
No, not there. Over there.

266
00:59:18,640 --> 00:59:27,120
I want you to find me... Are you in pain?
- No, no... it's nothing

267
00:59:27,120 --> 00:59:36,400
Can I go on? Are you ok? Are you ill?
- It's all right....

268
00:59:36,400 --> 00:59:42,920
Manager, I want a chamber-pot
- What? - Don't laugh at me!

269
00:59:42,920 --> 00:59:48,120
But you have all the comforts....
- I know, but I want a chamber-pot.

270
00:59:50,160 --> 00:59:51,240
This big...

271
00:59:51,280 --> 01:00:01,360
But that's small. For you?
- Yes, for me. I'll be back in half an hour...

272
01:02:14,880 --> 01:02:20,080
Did anyone call for me?
- Nobody. - Have you got the pot?

273
01:02:20,080 --> 01:02:28,400
The pot. Yes, I will send it up.
No, I'm in a hurry. I'll take it with me. Hurry!

274
01:02:34,000 --> 01:02:40,360
Not good? - Have you got a smaller one?
- No, this is the standard size.

275
01:02:57,640 --> 01:03:01,640
Ok, it'll be difficult,
but it'll do. I take it.

276
01:03:16,960 --> 01:03:24,520
Enough now... Now we'll weigh you.
He weighs exactly 4 kilos.

277
01:03:30,360 --> 01:03:33,400
That's it! I found
the house of the Sicilian girl.

278
01:03:36,240 --> 01:03:39,800
Where?
Let's go!

279
01:04:02,480 --> 01:04:08,760
I forgot to put the phone
off the hook. Wait here.

280
01:04:49,760 --> 01:04:54,280
Philippe, come here quickly.

281
01:04:58,120 --> 01:05:00,000
The baby has gone.

282
01:05:05,400 --> 01:05:08,560
But it is here.
- But it wasn't. - It's here!

283
01:05:08,560 --> 01:05:16,160
But it wasn't.
- Is it here or not? - Yes, it's here.

284
01:05:16,160 --> 01:05:26,720
But it wasn't here?
- Yes, yes, it was here... I remember now.

285
01:06:03,040 --> 01:06:06,120
It's here...

286
01:06:07,760 --> 01:06:13,080
Who's there?
- It's me. - Who's me?

287
01:06:13,080 --> 01:06:14,800
A friend.

288
01:06:43,280 --> 01:06:49,440
Who's that behind you?
- That's not me, that's him.

289
01:06:49,440 --> 01:06:51,400
That's him.
- That's her.

290
01:06:51,400 --> 01:06:54,960
That's him. He's the father.

291
01:06:57,680 --> 01:07:01,880
No, no. Everything will be ok.
We will solve everything.

292
01:07:13,280 --> 01:07:17,960
No, not the child!

293
01:07:29,760 --> 01:07:31,920
Blood! Blood!

294
01:07:34,680 --> 01:07:35,720
Blood!

295
01:07:37,320 --> 01:07:44,160
It's alright. Everything is fine.
Thanks a lot.

296
01:07:44,160 --> 01:07:49,120
Now we have two of them.
What's the name of Joseph's mother?

297
01:07:49,120 --> 01:07:50,640
Joseph?

298
01:07:50,640 --> 01:07:51,200
The little boy.

299
01:07:51,200 --> 01:07:52,400
But we don't know if 
his name's Joseph.

300
01:07:52,400 --> 01:07:55,760
I don't care. I call him Joseph.
Now, what's the name of Joseph's mother?

301
01:07:57,440 --> 01:08:02,400
Look at me! In my eyes! Who's the
mother of the boy? I'm listening...

302
01:08:03,960 --> 01:08:05,920
It was the maid of Marquis de Ronstalli.

303
01:08:07,240 --> 01:08:08,920
The maid of Marquis de Ronstalli!

304
01:08:10,200 --> 01:08:14,360
Ok, back to the hotel. We leave the little girl
with her brother and I take care of the baron.

305
01:08:14,360 --> 01:08:17,520
Of the Marquis.
- I don't care about the Marquis.

306
01:08:30,120 --> 01:08:34,040
Philippe, prepare a
bath at 37° C for the Sicilian.

307
01:08:34,040 --> 01:08:36,240
Yes, uncle.

308
01:08:53,720 --> 01:08:58,280
If you do lalalala

309
01:08:58,280 --> 01:09:02,040
think of the consequences

310
01:09:02,040 --> 01:09:05,880
all that is very nice

311
01:09:05,880 --> 01:09:09,320
but life is serious

312
01:09:10,960 --> 01:09:25,720
They were so beautiful, I just couldn't resist.
I just saw the beauty in them.

313
01:09:25,720 --> 01:09:32,320
If you do lalalala

314
01:09:32,320 --> 01:09:36,280
think of the consequences

315
01:09:36,280 --> 01:09:40,240
all that is very nice

316
01:09:40,240 --> 01:09:45,120
but life is serious

317
01:09:45,120 --> 01:09:58,440
But in their hearts I found the truth.
I was so happy I couldn't keep a clear head.

318
01:10:02,920 --> 01:10:20,600
If you do lalalala, think of the consequences
Children, prams, pipis and poopoos

319
01:10:23,920 --> 01:10:26,320
And now we have to find two nurses
for them. You will take care of that.

320
01:10:26,320 --> 01:10:29,720
Me? But how do I do that?
-I don't care. You will find a way.

321
01:10:29,720 --> 01:10:35,520
I'll take care of the Marquis Ronstalli. 
And we need a solution for the maid.

322
01:11:42,360 --> 01:11:46,720
Marquis, it's about one and a half
years ago... that is about 18 months..

323
01:11:46,720 --> 01:11:47,960
What?

324
01:11:47,960 --> 01:11:50,800
Well, two times nine months...

325
01:11:50,800 --> 01:11:52,280
What?

326
01:11:52,280 --> 01:11:57,320
My nephew and your maid have...

327
01:11:57,320 --> 01:11:59,800
I don't understand.

328
01:11:59,800 --> 01:12:03,920
My nephew and your maid have...

329
01:12:03,920 --> 01:12:05,680
I don't understand.

330
01:12:05,680 --> 01:12:08,640
There is a child now.

331
01:12:12,400 --> 01:12:13,840
Leave.

332
01:12:13,840 --> 01:12:16,560
But I'm absolutely serious.

333
01:12:16,560 --> 01:12:20,320
Sir, you're a loutl... a lout!

334
01:12:20,320 --> 01:12:22,240
But we even thought about marriage.

335
01:12:22,240 --> 01:12:27,680
That's impossible. That has already
happened. I married her.

336
01:12:27,680 --> 01:12:34,440
Your maid?
- Yes. She never had a child.

337
01:12:34,440 --> 01:12:38,120
I'm quite confused, Madam Marquis.

338
01:12:38,120 --> 01:12:40,920
It's not her. This one arrived yesterday.

339
01:12:40,920 --> 01:12:44,800
And my nephew's little boy?
- Leave!

340
01:12:44,800 --> 01:12:50,760
But Marquis, whose child is
the little boy of my nephew?

341
01:12:50,760 --> 01:12:56,280
But listen... I... well, ok... it's alright...

342
01:13:03,920 --> 01:13:06,600
This is weak. A bit more spirit.

343
01:13:12,200 --> 01:13:13,960
We did two rehearsals
and are waiting for you.

344
01:13:13,960 --> 01:13:14,800
What?

345
01:13:14,800 --> 01:13:16,600
We did two rehearsals
and are waiting for you.

346
01:13:16,600 --> 01:13:20,080
Philippe isn't here?
- Not yet. What shall we do?

347
01:13:20,080 --> 01:13:22,680
We prepare the bottles.

348
01:13:45,400 --> 01:13:50,200
I did it. I found two nurses.
- Good. I spoke to the Marquis. He's married.

349
01:13:50,200 --> 01:13:52,200
To whom?
- To the maid.

350
01:13:52,200 --> 01:13:55,160
To mine?
- No, to his... Well, yes to yours.

351
01:13:55,160 --> 01:14:00,160
And the boy? - No boy. He's not hers.
-Whose?

352
01:14:00,160 --> 01:14:03,200
The maid. There must be another girl.

353
01:14:03,200 --> 01:14:05,840
That's impossible, I didn't have any others.
I swear.

354
01:14:05,840 --> 01:14:08,840
You swear it by the heads of your children?
- Yes.

355
01:14:08,840 --> 01:14:13,040
Now I don't know any more, I don't
understand anything any longer, nothing...

356
01:14:42,040 --> 01:14:46,440
Where is my daughter?

357
01:14:52,960 --> 01:15:05,840
My son has disappeared. My baby has gone.

358
01:15:16,760 --> 01:15:19,320
Call the police!

359
01:17:11,320 --> 01:17:14,160
It's very easy, commissioner.
- Do you think so?

360
01:17:14,160 --> 01:17:16,840
Do you speak French well?
- Yes, yes.

361
01:17:16,840 --> 01:17:23,680
I thought my nephew's son was the
son of the Sicilian. But it was a little girl.

362
01:17:23,680 --> 01:17:26,800
The Sicilian was a little girl?

363
01:17:26,800 --> 01:17:29,920
No, the little boy.

364
01:17:29,920 --> 01:17:33,600
Ah, the little boy was a little girl.

365
01:17:33,600 --> 01:17:37,120
He doesn't understand at all...
-I understand perfectly... go on explaining!

366
01:17:37,120 --> 01:17:40,760
The two are mine,
commissioner.

367
01:17:40,760 --> 01:17:47,520
Speak when you're spoken to.
Everybody waits for their turn.

368
01:17:47,520 --> 01:17:55,440
The little boy wasn't the child of the Sicilian
but is still the son of my nephew. - I see...

369
01:17:55,440 --> 01:17:58,400
But the little girl was
the child of the maid.

370
01:17:58,400 --> 01:18:00,720
The maid?
- Of the Marquis...

371
01:18:00,720 --> 01:18:02,920
Bien shore, bien shore...

372
01:18:02,920 --> 01:18:06,640
Er, you don't say
bien shore, you say bien-sûr.

373
01:18:06,640 --> 01:18:08,600
Thank you very much!

374
01:18:08,600 --> 01:18:14,680
And why did you put these
little babies in those big drums?

375
01:18:14,680 --> 01:18:18,360
Because we were looking
for two nurses.

376
01:18:18,360 --> 01:18:23,280
Yes, nurses.
- What are you trying to tell me with that?

377
01:18:23,280 --> 01:18:30,960
I understand, you want to
make fun of the commissioner.

378
01:19:19,120 --> 01:19:21,960
And what about him?
- He will marry.

379
01:19:21,960 --> 01:19:27,240
Yes, I will marry...
We will marry each other.

380
01:19:35,480 --> 01:19:40,520
And now the three of us
start working together!
