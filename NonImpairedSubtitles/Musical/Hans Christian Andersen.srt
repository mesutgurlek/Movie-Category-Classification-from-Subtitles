1
00:02:19,200 --> 00:02:22,237
Good morning, schoolmaster.

2
00:02:33,280 --> 00:02:35,236
See the kite?

3
00:02:59,040 --> 00:03:00,996
Tell us a story!

4
00:03:12,680 --> 00:03:18,357
<i>Wait for me, Hans! Please wait.
Well, hurry up. Faster!</i>

5
00:03:20,520 --> 00:03:22,078
Thank you.

6
00:03:22,280 --> 00:03:24,236
Next time, don't be late.

7
00:03:24,440 --> 00:03:29,958
Now, yesterday, Matilda was the wicked
mermaid - the princess of the frozen sea.

8
00:03:30,160 --> 00:03:31,878
<i>- Remember that?
- Yes.</i>

9
00:03:32,120 --> 00:03:35,590
Today, as I promised -
we always keep our promises, don't we?

10
00:03:35,800 --> 00:03:37,233
<i>Yes!</i>

11
00:03:37,440 --> 00:03:41,319
<i>- Today, as I promised, she will be the...
- Queen of China!</i>

12
00:03:41,520 --> 00:03:45,479
Did anybody remember to bring
a dress for the queen of China?

13
00:03:45,680 --> 00:03:47,989
<i>You said you would!</i>

14
00:03:48,200 --> 00:03:50,156
All right.

15
00:03:50,360 --> 00:03:53,033
Please, ladies and gentlemen.

16
00:03:53,240 --> 00:03:55,993
If we can't have a queen,
then we'll have a king.

17
00:03:56,200 --> 00:04:00,113
It's very simple. We just take
the crown and put it over on the side.

18
00:04:00,320 --> 00:04:04,916
He was a very jaunty little king -
wore his crown like that. Now, we'll just...

19
00:04:05,760 --> 00:04:07,830
Ah... No peeping.

20
00:04:10,080 --> 00:04:12,036
There we are.

21
00:04:12,240 --> 00:04:14,435
Long live the king!

22
00:04:14,640 --> 00:04:16,312
<i>Long live the king!</i>

23
00:04:16,520 --> 00:04:20,513
That's not a king.
It's only a queen with a moustache.

24
00:04:22,880 --> 00:04:26,668
Well, a lot of kings
are only a queen with a moustache.

25
00:04:26,880 --> 00:04:30,270
- We all believe it's a king, don't we?
- Yes!

26
00:04:30,480 --> 00:04:32,869
Since we have no clothes for the king,

27
00:04:33,080 --> 00:04:36,197
this is a story about a king
who had no clothes,

28
00:04:36,400 --> 00:04:40,359
and about a little boy
who only believed what he saw.

29
00:04:40,560 --> 00:04:43,597
<i>That's you!</i>

30
00:04:44,560 --> 00:04:48,678
Well, one day, two swindlers
came to see the king

31
00:04:48,880 --> 00:04:52,031
to sell him what they said
was a magic suit of clothes.

32
00:04:52,240 --> 00:04:56,313
Now, the king was very fond of new
clothes, so he said, "Let me see it."

33
00:04:56,520 --> 00:05:01,310
But there wasn't any suit of clothes.
The swindlers held up their hands like this

34
00:05:01,520 --> 00:05:04,717
and said,
"Your Majesty, this is a magic suit.

35
00:05:04,920 --> 00:05:09,152
"You, being very wise and intelligent,
can see how beautiful it is,

36
00:05:09,360 --> 00:05:12,432
"but to a fool, it is absolutely invisible."

37
00:05:13,600 --> 00:05:15,955
Well, he said, "I see."

38
00:05:16,160 --> 00:05:18,628
Not wanting to appear a fool, he added,

39
00:05:18,840 --> 00:05:21,957
"Yes, indeed. I see it perfectly.

40
00:05:22,160 --> 00:05:23,752
"It's beautiful.

41
00:05:23,960 --> 00:05:27,999
"Isn't it grand? Isn't it fine?
Look at the cut, the style, the line!

42
00:05:28,200 --> 00:05:31,510
"The suit of clothes is altogether
but altogether, it's altogether

43
00:05:31,720 --> 00:05:34,712
"The most remarkable suit of clothes
that I have ever seen

44
00:05:34,920 --> 00:05:38,469
"These eyes of mine at once determine
the sleeves are velvet, the cape is ermine

45
00:05:38,680 --> 00:05:41,592
"The hose are blue and
the doublet is a lovely shade of green!"

46
00:05:41,800 --> 00:05:43,916
<i>A lovely shade of green!</i>

47
00:05:44,120 --> 00:05:46,076
"Somebody send for the queen!"

48
00:05:46,280 --> 00:05:51,991
The queen came and she was told
how all the wise people could see the...

49
00:05:52,200 --> 00:05:54,998
<i>- Magic suit!
- That's right.</i>

50
00:05:55,200 --> 00:05:58,795
Naturally, not wanting
to appear a fool, she said,

51
00:05:59,000 --> 00:06:01,719
"Oh! Isn't it grand?

52
00:06:01,920 --> 00:06:04,878
"Isn't it rich?
Look at the charm of every stitch!

53
00:06:05,080 --> 00:06:07,514
"The suit of clothes is altogether,
it's altogether

54
00:06:07,720 --> 00:06:10,951
"The most remarkable suit of clothes
that I have ever seen

55
00:06:11,160 --> 00:06:14,914
"These eyes of mine at once determine
the sleeves are velvet, the cape is ermine

56
00:06:15,120 --> 00:06:18,192
"The hose are blue and the doublet
is a lovely shade of green!"

57
00:06:18,400 --> 00:06:22,279
- A lovely shade of green!
- "Summon the court to convene!"

58
00:06:22,480 --> 00:06:25,711
All the court came, the ministers
and ambassadors came.

59
00:06:25,920 --> 00:06:29,390
Not wanting to seem like fools,
they agreed with the...

60
00:06:29,600 --> 00:06:34,754
- King and queen.
- The king issued a proclamation.

61
00:06:36,920 --> 00:06:40,276
The suit of clothes is altogether
but altogether, it's altogether

62
00:06:40,480 --> 00:06:43,153
The most remarkable suit of clothes
a tailor ever made

63
00:06:43,360 --> 00:06:47,717
Now quickly put it altogether
with gloves of leather and hat and feather

64
00:06:47,920 --> 00:06:50,957
It's altogether the thing
to wear at Saturday's parade

65
00:06:51,160 --> 00:06:55,119
- Saturday's parade!
- Leading the royal brigade!

66
00:06:55,320 --> 00:06:59,029
By this time, everybody had heard
about the king's new clothes

67
00:06:59,240 --> 00:07:01,071
that he would wear at the parade.

68
00:07:01,280 --> 00:07:06,274
The people lined the streets as
the artillery came by, the infantry came by,

69
00:07:06,480 --> 00:07:10,632
and the cavalry came by and the fife
and drum corps and the royal guard,

70
00:07:10,840 --> 00:07:12,796
and finally the king.

71
00:07:13,000 --> 00:07:15,230
Everybody cheered "Hurray"...

72
00:07:17,320 --> 00:07:19,788
...because nobody wanted
to appear a fool.

73
00:07:20,000 --> 00:07:22,833
Nobody that is except one little boy

74
00:07:23,040 --> 00:07:27,397
who, for some strange reason, hadn't
heard about the king's new magic suit,

75
00:07:27,600 --> 00:07:30,717
and didn't know
what he was supposed to see.

76
00:07:30,920 --> 00:07:33,309
He took one look at the king,

77
00:07:33,520 --> 00:07:36,592
turned a little pale and said,

78
00:07:36,800 --> 00:07:40,395
"Look at the king! Look at the king!

79
00:07:40,600 --> 00:07:44,115
"The king is in the altogether,
but altogether, the altogether

80
00:07:44,320 --> 00:07:47,517
"He's altogether as naked
as the day that he was born

81
00:07:47,720 --> 00:07:50,792
"The king is in the altogether,
but altogether, the altogether

82
00:07:51,000 --> 00:07:54,072
"It's altogether the very least
the king has ever worn

83
00:07:54,280 --> 00:07:57,272
"Call the court physician,
call an intermission

84
00:07:57,480 --> 00:08:00,836
"His majesty is wide open
to ridicule and scorn

85
00:08:01,040 --> 00:08:04,953
"The king is in the altogether,
but altogether, the altogether

86
00:08:05,160 --> 00:08:07,594
"He's altogether as naked
as the day that he was born

87
00:08:07,800 --> 00:08:12,794
"And it's altogether too chilly a morn!"

88
00:08:15,960 --> 00:08:18,997
<i>- Hans!
- Hurry, Peter.</i>

89
00:08:19,200 --> 00:08:21,236
We're going to hear another story.

90
00:08:21,440 --> 00:08:24,955
Hans, the schoolmaster
went to the Burgomaster and the...

91
00:08:25,160 --> 00:08:28,709
Peter, don't worry so much
on a beautiful day like this.

92
00:08:28,920 --> 00:08:34,472
They're coming here - the schoolmaster,
the Burgomaster, the council. Look!

93
00:08:42,560 --> 00:08:44,676
<i>Good morning, Burgomaster.</i>

94
00:08:44,880 --> 00:08:48,475
Look, Burgomaster.
The books - on the dirty ground!

95
00:08:49,440 --> 00:08:53,831
<i>Here. The History of Denmark
used to tie the string of a dirty kite!</i>

96
00:08:54,040 --> 00:08:57,589
The history of any country
can always stand a little fresh air.

97
00:08:57,800 --> 00:09:00,997
Did you hear about the history book
that took a vacation

98
00:09:01,200 --> 00:09:04,078
and came back a much better history?

99
00:09:05,440 --> 00:09:09,069
You see? That's the stuff
he fills the children's heads with!

100
00:09:09,280 --> 00:09:11,510
Look at this.

101
00:09:11,720 --> 00:09:14,393
"Arithmetic. A two met a four one day.

102
00:09:14,600 --> 00:09:17,751
"They liked each other immediately
and got married,

103
00:09:17,960 --> 00:09:20,952
"and all the other numbers
came to their wedding."

104
00:09:21,160 --> 00:09:25,278
- It's impossible!
- There are different ways of learning.

105
00:09:25,480 --> 00:09:29,109
A cobbler belongs in his shop,
and children belong in school.

106
00:09:29,320 --> 00:09:33,233
- Tend to your shoes. I'll tend to my school!
- To be sure.

107
00:09:33,440 --> 00:09:39,072
But is the world made up of nothing else
but shoes and schoolrooms, and...?

108
00:09:40,880 --> 00:09:44,555
There's a story
of a piece of chalk and a blackboard.

109
00:09:44,760 --> 00:09:48,469
The piece of chalk had written
so many things on the blackboard

110
00:09:48,680 --> 00:09:51,399
that it believed
it knew all about everything.

111
00:09:51,600 --> 00:09:53,272
The blackboard was angry.

112
00:09:53,480 --> 00:09:57,553
She felt that without her to write upon,
nobody would know anything,

113
00:09:57,760 --> 00:10:00,149
and she was the one
who really knew it all.

114
00:10:00,360 --> 00:10:02,316
One day, quite by accident,

115
00:10:02,520 --> 00:10:06,752
the schoolmaster broke the piece of chalk
and tossed it out of the window.

116
00:10:06,960 --> 00:10:10,919
It fell beside a pencil that the piece
of chalk had always admired.

117
00:10:11,120 --> 00:10:14,954
A pencil to a piece of chalk
is something very special.

118
00:10:15,160 --> 00:10:19,119
- And what do you suppose happened?
- What happened?

119
00:10:19,320 --> 00:10:22,118
<i>What is this? Have we all lost our senses?</i>

120
00:10:22,320 --> 00:10:25,756
Are you going listen to him
with the children? What is this?

121
00:10:25,960 --> 00:10:27,916
That will be enough, Hans.

122
00:10:28,120 --> 00:10:32,557
Children, pick up your schoolbooks
and go back to school. Hurry now.

123
00:10:32,760 --> 00:10:36,548
Follow the schoolmaster.
Not another word from anyone.

124
00:10:44,240 --> 00:10:49,075
I advise you, Hans, to stay in your shop
from now on. Come, gentlemen.

125
00:10:56,600 --> 00:10:59,751
Stop shaking your head at me
like an old woman, Peter.

126
00:10:59,960 --> 00:11:05,159
- I can feel it in the back of my neck.
- Hans, turn around. I've got to talk to you.

127
00:11:05,360 --> 00:11:07,828
Did you ever hear
the story of the old woman

128
00:11:08,040 --> 00:11:12,591
who shook her head at the family
so much that it fell off, right on the table?

129
00:11:12,800 --> 00:11:15,519
Hans, why do you keep
on making trouble for us?

130
00:11:15,720 --> 00:11:20,589
Trouble? There's no trouble
that a good story can't get us out of -

131
00:11:20,800 --> 00:11:24,839
like the one just now about the piece
of chalk and the blackboard.

132
00:11:25,040 --> 00:11:28,555
I didn't know what I was going to say
until after I'd said it.

133
00:11:28,760 --> 00:11:31,752
In fact, I'd like to know
how the story ends myself.

134
00:11:31,960 --> 00:11:35,919
Please stay in the shop. Don't tell
the children stories all the time.

135
00:11:36,120 --> 00:11:38,554
I never saw such a worrier like you, Peter.

136
00:11:38,760 --> 00:11:42,594
You want to really worry
about something? Here's something.

137
00:11:42,800 --> 00:11:45,439
Two years ago, I took you
out of the orphanage

138
00:11:45,640 --> 00:11:49,792
and promised them I'd make you
into a good cobbler. Two whole years.

139
00:11:50,000 --> 00:11:54,232
Look at that shoe - glue all smeared
and nails in crooked.

140
00:11:56,000 --> 00:12:00,073
Two years an apprentice,
and still the nails go in crooked.

141
00:12:00,280 --> 00:12:05,149
I'm not that bad, am I? You're not going to
send me back to the orphanage, are you?

142
00:12:05,360 --> 00:12:08,511
Aha! A new worry appears in the sky.

143
00:12:10,320 --> 00:12:12,311
Never mind, Peter. Let's go home.

144
00:12:30,520 --> 00:12:34,115
<i>Two and two are four</i>

145
00:12:34,320 --> 00:12:37,915
Four and four are eight

146
00:12:38,120 --> 00:12:42,079
Eight and eight are sixteen

147
00:12:42,280 --> 00:12:46,717
Sixteen and sixteen are thirty-two

148
00:12:46,920 --> 00:12:50,708
Two and two are four

149
00:12:50,920 --> 00:12:54,595
Four and four are eight

150
00:12:54,800 --> 00:12:58,634
Eight and eight are sixteen

151
00:12:58,840 --> 00:13:02,628
Sixteen and sixteen are thirty-two...

152
00:13:02,840 --> 00:13:05,912
An inchworm. The first one of the year!

153
00:13:06,120 --> 00:13:11,148
<i>Four and four are eight</i>

154
00:13:11,360 --> 00:13:15,433
Eight and eight are sixteen

155
00:13:15,640 --> 00:13:20,509
Sixteen and sixteen are thirty-two...

156
00:13:20,720 --> 00:13:23,154
Inchworm

157
00:13:23,360 --> 00:13:25,590
Inchworm

158
00:13:25,800 --> 00:13:30,749
Measuring the marigolds

159
00:13:30,960 --> 00:13:35,397
You and your arithmetic

160
00:13:35,600 --> 00:13:40,355
You'll probably go far

161
00:13:41,200 --> 00:13:43,077
Inchworm

162
00:13:43,280 --> 00:13:45,919
Inchworm

163
00:13:46,120 --> 00:13:51,114
Measuring the marigolds

164
00:13:51,320 --> 00:13:53,311
Seems to me

165
00:13:53,520 --> 00:13:56,318
You stop and see

166
00:13:56,520 --> 00:14:02,117
How beautiful they are

167
00:14:02,320 --> 00:14:06,472
<i>Two and two are four</i>

168
00:14:06,680 --> 00:14:11,435
Four and four are eight

169
00:14:11,640 --> 00:14:16,077
Eight and eight are sixteen

170
00:14:16,280 --> 00:14:20,910
Sixteen and sixteen are thirty-two

171
00:14:33,800 --> 00:14:36,075
Good morning, schoolmaster.

172
00:14:38,760 --> 00:14:40,352
Oh, Hans.

173
00:14:54,760 --> 00:14:56,830
- Let me explain...
- Out of my way!

174
00:15:06,120 --> 00:15:09,112
<i>I am talking sense,
and that is exactly what I want.</i>

175
00:15:09,320 --> 00:15:12,676
Either Hans Christian Andersen
leaves this town or I do.

176
00:15:12,880 --> 00:15:17,476
Surely, schoolmaster, a little story
now and then - not during school hours.

177
00:15:17,680 --> 00:15:20,433
It is not just now and then, it is all the time.

178
00:15:20,640 --> 00:15:23,029
When they are late,
he gives them excuses.

179
00:15:23,240 --> 00:15:26,915
"The snow queen took me
to see the king of the mountain!"

180
00:15:27,120 --> 00:15:30,590
That is true.
I asked my Gerda what time it was.

181
00:15:30,800 --> 00:15:35,191
She said the minute hand and the hour
hand were not speaking to each other.

182
00:15:35,400 --> 00:15:38,233
They were both in love
with the second hand.

183
00:15:38,440 --> 00:15:43,594
They wouldn't meet till 12 o'clock,
and no one could tell the time until then.

184
00:15:44,520 --> 00:15:46,476
- I like that.
- Like it?

185
00:15:46,680 --> 00:15:51,549
We pay our taxes for the school, not for
Hans to fill their heads with foolishness.

186
00:15:51,760 --> 00:15:55,275
But Hans's stories are good.
The children learn from them.

187
00:15:55,480 --> 00:15:58,836
- They are not foolish stories.
- I would like to know now.

188
00:15:59,040 --> 00:16:00,792
I would like to pack up tonight.

189
00:16:01,000 --> 00:16:04,629
Tomorrow, you'll be looking
for a new cobbler or a new teacher.

190
00:16:09,440 --> 00:16:12,000
Gentlemen...

191
00:16:19,000 --> 00:16:21,992
It is decided. The cobbler must leave.

192
00:16:22,200 --> 00:16:24,156
- But...
- Quiet!

193
00:16:24,360 --> 00:16:28,797
I'll tell Hans myself. It will not be pleasant,
but I see it has to be done.

194
00:16:29,000 --> 00:16:32,754
Perhaps it's all for the best.
Tell Hans to wait in the shop for me.

195
00:16:32,960 --> 00:16:36,032
I'll talk to him before supper.
Come, gentlemen.

196
00:17:03,760 --> 00:17:06,149
- Hello, Hans.
- Hello, Peter.

197
00:17:06,360 --> 00:17:09,670
- Was it nice by the river?
- Just perfect.

198
00:17:09,880 --> 00:17:12,235
Did we have any customers today?

199
00:17:12,440 --> 00:17:16,718
Not one. It just gets slower and slower.

200
00:17:17,000 --> 00:17:21,710
Don't you think we should go to a larger
city where shoes wear out faster?

201
00:17:21,920 --> 00:17:26,755
And be stuck in the shop all day?
No, sir. I like business to be a little slow.

202
00:17:26,960 --> 00:17:29,428
There's time enough for everything here.

203
00:17:29,640 --> 00:17:33,428
That's what I mean, Hans. No shoes
wear out. No one ever leaves.

204
00:17:33,640 --> 00:17:37,792
Not one person in this village
has ever been to Copenhagen, have they?

205
00:17:38,000 --> 00:17:42,357
That's true, but why should they?
I never think about Copenhagen - do you?

206
00:17:42,560 --> 00:17:46,109
Do I? What do you suppose
Copenhagen is really like?

207
00:17:48,360 --> 00:17:53,912
It's a funny thing, now that you mention it.
I used to think about Copenhagen a lot.

208
00:17:54,120 --> 00:17:57,749
I used to make up the most wonderful
stories about going there.

209
00:17:57,960 --> 00:18:01,475
I used to think about Copenhagen
a lot when I was your age.

210
00:18:01,680 --> 00:18:03,591
My husband says the shoes hurt.

211
00:18:03,800 --> 00:18:08,828
- They squeak and the left one doesn't fit.
- That's all? That's not too bad, Mrs Burda.

212
00:18:09,040 --> 00:18:12,635
I sometimes think
that shoes have a life of their own.

213
00:18:12,840 --> 00:18:15,638
The ones that squeak
don't like to leave the shop,

214
00:18:15,840 --> 00:18:19,196
and the ones that hurt
don't like whoever's wearing them.

215
00:18:19,400 --> 00:18:23,598
Please, Hans, just fix the shoes.
I've got my own life to worry about.

216
00:18:23,800 --> 00:18:27,315
When Mr Burda's feet hurt,
he drives the whole house crazy.

217
00:18:27,520 --> 00:18:31,593
Hans, tell me. What kind of stories
did you make up about Copenhagen?

218
00:18:33,360 --> 00:18:39,071
Oh... I used to dream about having
the finest cobbler shop in Copenhagen.

219
00:18:39,280 --> 00:18:44,195
I wasn't just an ordinary cobbler.
I only saw people by appointment.

220
00:18:44,400 --> 00:18:47,836
First I looked at them
before I even looked at their shoes,

221
00:18:48,040 --> 00:18:50,076
and if I didn't like them, no shoes.

222
00:18:50,280 --> 00:18:52,191
Do you know that peop...?

223
00:18:52,400 --> 00:18:55,949
Where are you going?
Don't you want to hear the rest of it?

224
00:18:58,520 --> 00:19:01,557
- What's that?
- Your bag. It's all packed, Hans.

225
00:19:01,760 --> 00:19:05,036
- My bag?
- Go to Copenhagen now. Right now.

226
00:19:05,240 --> 00:19:07,196
Are you crazy, Peter?

227
00:19:07,400 --> 00:19:10,915
That was a story I was telling.
Didn't you understand that?

228
00:19:11,120 --> 00:19:14,908
Of course I understood,
but part of it must be like you imagined,

229
00:19:15,120 --> 00:19:18,032
and maybe even great carriages
with fine horses,

230
00:19:18,240 --> 00:19:20,515
beautiful houses three storeys high.

231
00:19:20,720 --> 00:19:25,475
Don't you want to see it for yourself? It's
not so far from here - your bag's packed.

232
00:19:25,680 --> 00:19:30,037
All you have to do is walk out of that door.
Quick! Before you change your mind.

233
00:19:31,240 --> 00:19:36,360
Before I change my mind? Who said
I was going? Just like that, this afternoon?

234
00:19:36,560 --> 00:19:38,710
What's got into you, Peter, anyway?

235
00:19:38,920 --> 00:19:41,639
You forgot about Copenhagen
all these years.

236
00:19:41,840 --> 00:19:45,116
You may forget about it again
until you're too old to go.

237
00:19:45,320 --> 00:19:47,880
No, some day I'm really going
to Copenhagen.

238
00:19:48,080 --> 00:19:51,152
- That's the one thing I'm sure of.
- Who knows?

239
00:19:51,360 --> 00:19:55,592
Has anyone from this village gone
to Copenhagen before? Of course not.

240
00:19:55,800 --> 00:19:59,429
They keep putting it off.
Imagine, Hans, you'll be the first.

241
00:19:59,640 --> 00:20:03,997
What a to-do there'll be tomorrow.
They'll talk of nothing else for days.

242
00:20:04,200 --> 00:20:06,270
"Hans has gone to Copenhagen!"

243
00:20:08,360 --> 00:20:11,875
"Hans has gone to Copenhagen."

244
00:20:15,320 --> 00:20:17,276
Yes!

245
00:20:17,480 --> 00:20:22,235
What a sign it would make! "Hans
Christian Andersen, gone to Copenhagen"

246
00:20:22,440 --> 00:20:25,637
with little shoes pointing
the way out of town!

247
00:20:25,840 --> 00:20:31,597
I'll make the sign tonight. I see it exactly
as you do - the little shoes, everything!

248
00:20:31,800 --> 00:20:34,155
Goodbye, Hans. Aren't you excited?

249
00:20:34,360 --> 00:20:37,318
<i>Excited? You mean
I really should go, Peter?</i>

250
00:20:37,520 --> 00:20:39,909
Why not? It's only a few days away.

251
00:20:40,120 --> 00:20:44,432
You stay a little while and then come
back, but you've been to Copenhagen.

252
00:20:44,640 --> 00:20:46,392
But it's a big step, Peter.

253
00:20:46,600 --> 00:20:49,717
Still, what's to stop me?

254
00:20:50,760 --> 00:20:52,830
My goodness, I am getting excited!

255
00:20:53,040 --> 00:20:54,519
Hans!

256
00:20:54,720 --> 00:20:58,838
If anyone had told me this morning
that I'd decide to go to Copenhagen...

257
00:20:59,040 --> 00:21:01,156
- Start walking!
- Imagine, Peter.

258
00:21:01,360 --> 00:21:05,194
I've decided to go to Copenhagen,
just like I made it up in a story.

259
00:21:05,400 --> 00:21:08,358
- Goodbye, Hans.
- Goodbye, Peter.

260
00:21:08,560 --> 00:21:12,951
Goodbye, Peter, and take care of yourself.
I'll only be gone a few days.

261
00:21:13,160 --> 00:21:15,720
- Tell the children goodbye for me.
- I will.

262
00:21:15,920 --> 00:21:18,912
Imagine, Peter - Copenhagen!

263
00:21:19,120 --> 00:21:20,951
Goodbye, Peter.

264
00:21:48,760 --> 00:21:50,318
Hello.

265
00:21:54,840 --> 00:21:57,957
Oh, my goodness. My feet hurt.

266
00:22:01,960 --> 00:22:05,555
I cannot understand
why these shoes hurt me so.

267
00:22:05,760 --> 00:22:10,390
I made them myself. You're lucky.
You don't have to wear shoes.

268
00:22:10,600 --> 00:22:15,628
I can never understand why people
use that expression "A dog's life".

269
00:22:15,840 --> 00:22:20,755
Every dog I ever knew
seemed to have a very nice life indeed.

270
00:22:21,520 --> 00:22:24,876
You've no idea, and maybe
it's just as good you don't.

271
00:22:25,440 --> 00:22:29,558
Back in the village, if people
saw me talking to you like this,

272
00:22:29,760 --> 00:22:32,558
do you know what would happen?

273
00:22:32,760 --> 00:22:36,753
Every head would shake for a week,
and yet how pleasant this is!

274
00:22:37,960 --> 00:22:42,476
I can say anything I want to, and there's
no sound except the wag of your tail.

275
00:22:45,040 --> 00:22:47,873
And people do the strangest things, too.

276
00:22:48,080 --> 00:22:51,231
Oh, yes, my friend.
Even me. Myself included.

277
00:22:51,440 --> 00:22:53,590
For instance, if you were to ask me

278
00:22:53,800 --> 00:22:57,634
what I was doing on the road
to Copenhagen, do you know something?

279
00:22:57,840 --> 00:22:59,432
I couldn't tell you.

280
00:22:59,640 --> 00:23:04,111
I was trying to figure it out a little
while ago - what Peter said, what I said.

281
00:23:04,320 --> 00:23:07,596
All of a sudden, I find myself
on the road to Copenhagen.

282
00:23:07,800 --> 00:23:11,156
Do you know something else, my friend?

283
00:23:11,360 --> 00:23:13,715
I'm a little bit frightened.

284
00:23:13,920 --> 00:23:16,912
Copenhagen is a very big place.

285
00:23:17,120 --> 00:23:20,669
Still, what can happen, huh?

286
00:23:20,880 --> 00:23:22,996
People are nice.

287
00:23:23,200 --> 00:23:27,910
That's the nice thing about the world,
my friend - people.

288
00:23:28,120 --> 00:23:31,192
So, what can happen?

289
00:23:32,280 --> 00:23:35,875
I'll walk through the gates of the city,
go up to someone and say,

290
00:23:36,080 --> 00:23:39,914
"How do you do?
I'm Hans Christian Andersen."

291
00:23:41,360 --> 00:23:47,230
I'll walk through the gates of the city, and
I'll say, "I'm Hans Christian Andersen".

292
00:23:47,440 --> 00:23:49,908
I'm Hans Christian Andersen

293
00:23:50,120 --> 00:23:52,315
I've many a tale to tell

294
00:23:52,520 --> 00:23:56,308
And though I'm a cobbler,
I'd say I tell them rather well

295
00:23:56,520 --> 00:24:00,399
I'll mend your shoes and I'll fix
your boots when I have a moment free

296
00:24:00,600 --> 00:24:02,318
When I'm not otherwise occupied

297
00:24:02,520 --> 00:24:06,035
As a purple duck or a mountain side
or a quarter after three

298
00:24:06,240 --> 00:24:09,835
I'm Hans Christian Andersen,
that's me!

299
00:24:13,960 --> 00:24:17,919
I'm Hans Christian Andersen
and this is an April day

300
00:24:18,120 --> 00:24:21,715
It's full of the magic I need
to speed me on my way

301
00:24:21,920 --> 00:24:25,549
My pocketbook has an empty look
I limp on a lumpy shoe

302
00:24:25,760 --> 00:24:27,512
So I turn into a flying fish

303
00:24:27,720 --> 00:24:31,315
Or a millionaire with a rocking chair
and a dumpling in my stew

304
00:24:31,520 --> 00:24:33,351
I'm Hans Christian Andersen

305
00:24:33,560 --> 00:24:35,152
Andersen, that's who!

306
00:24:35,960 --> 00:24:37,916
<i>Hans!</i>

307
00:24:38,120 --> 00:24:40,076
Hans!

308
00:24:44,960 --> 00:24:46,871
Peter!

309
00:24:51,880 --> 00:24:54,235
Peter, what are you doing here?

310
00:24:54,440 --> 00:24:57,352
What's this? You've got
the whole shop on wheels.

311
00:24:57,560 --> 00:25:00,120
Copenhagen sounded so wonderful, Hans,

312
00:25:00,320 --> 00:25:03,756
I got to thinking maybe
you wouldn't come back for a while.

313
00:25:03,960 --> 00:25:07,919
Maybe for a long while,
so I thought maybe you'd need the shop.

314
00:25:08,120 --> 00:25:12,557
Peter, sometimes I think you put ideas
into my head that aren't even there.

315
00:25:12,760 --> 00:25:15,593
Me? Oh, no, Hans.

316
00:25:15,800 --> 00:25:19,236
I'm not at all sure I shouldn't
send you back right now.

317
00:25:19,440 --> 00:25:22,238
- But, Hans...
- Still...

318
00:25:22,440 --> 00:25:25,113
...as long as you've come this far...

319
00:25:37,560 --> 00:25:40,233
I sail up the Skagerrak

320
00:25:40,440 --> 00:25:42,874
And sail down the Kattegatt

321
00:25:43,080 --> 00:25:47,631
Through the harbour and up to the quay

322
00:25:47,840 --> 00:25:50,991
And there she stands

323
00:25:51,200 --> 00:25:53,714

324
00:25:53,920 --> 00:25:59,552

Hans, why don't we set up shop here?

00:29:51,200 --> 00:29:54,670
Here? Well, what are we waiting for?

375
00:30:06,640 --> 00:30:10,599
I'm Hans Christian Andersen,
the pride of the cobbler's trade

376
00:30:10,800 --> 00:30:14,918
Permit me to show you
a great discovery I've made

377
00:30:15,120 --> 00:30:19,079
A shoe goes squeak and a shoe goes
squawk, a squeak-iddy-squawk all day

378
00:30:19,280 --> 00:30:22,670
Though you'd figure a shoe can't talk, if
you listen close to the squeak and squawk

379
00:30:22,880 --> 00:30:24,438
You can plainly hear it say

380
00:30:24,640 --> 00:30:27,950
"Let Hans Christian Andersen
fix me right away!"

381
00:30:30,560 --> 00:30:34,519
In Hans Christian Andersen
your feet have a loyal friend

382
00:30:34,720 --> 00:30:38,679
The sort of a doctor, I'm sure,
your toes would recommend

383
00:30:38,880 --> 00:30:42,031
I work all night if a shoe's too tight
to see where the pinch comes from

384
00:30:42,240 --> 00:30:46,392
I raise my hammer and shut one eye
and I sometimes hit on the reason why

385
00:30:46,600 --> 00:30:49,478
And I sometimes hit my thumb. Oh!

386
00:30:49,680 --> 00:30:52,717
- What's your name?
- I'm Hans Christian Andersen!

387
00:30:52,920 --> 00:30:55,559
- You're under arrest.
- Under arrest?

388
00:30:55,760 --> 00:30:58,593
Disrespect for the King's statue.
Get that boy!

389
00:31:06,680 --> 00:31:08,989
Run, Peter! Run!

390
00:31:44,320 --> 00:31:49,678
Do you want the new ballet ready
for the tour, Otto? Then do as I say - now!

391
00:31:49,880 --> 00:31:54,510
- You heard what we said.
- Niels, be sensible.

392
00:31:54,720 --> 00:31:57,598
All right, don't do it. Stand here and argue.

393
00:31:57,800 --> 00:32:01,156
I'll get a cobbler
while you go and teach them the ballet.

394
00:32:01,360 --> 00:32:04,955
Why is it a matter of life and death
to have a cobbler right now?

395
00:32:05,160 --> 00:32:08,118
Because you have a ballerina
who is so pig-headed

396
00:32:08,320 --> 00:32:12,074
that I must make an example of her
in front of the entire company.

397
00:32:12,280 --> 00:32:13,793
That's awful perfume.

398
00:32:14,000 --> 00:32:16,150
- Sir, I know where...
- Go away!

399
00:32:16,360 --> 00:32:20,353
She won't get away with this.
I know her far better than you do.

400
00:32:20,560 --> 00:32:24,997
- Very well. You know her...
- Otto, the ballet is only half finished.

401
00:32:25,200 --> 00:32:28,909
No cobbler, no ballet. I guarantee it, Otto!

402
00:32:31,200 --> 00:32:34,476
- I know where you can get a cobbler, sir.
- What's that?

403
00:32:34,680 --> 00:32:37,319
I said I know
where you can get a cobbler, sir.

404
00:32:37,520 --> 00:32:38,794
Where?

405
00:32:39,000 --> 00:32:42,151
- You'll have to use a little influence.
- Influence?

406
00:32:42,360 --> 00:32:44,749
With the police. We should hurry, sir.

407
00:32:44,960 --> 00:32:48,111
I know where one is sitting right now!

408
00:33:05,520 --> 00:33:08,956
<i>- Hello.
- Hello.</i>

409
00:33:09,160 --> 00:33:11,469
- Hello!
- Hello!

410
00:33:12,360 --> 00:33:14,555
Are you all alone in there?

411
00:33:14,760 --> 00:33:17,957
Well, in a way, yes.

412
00:33:18,160 --> 00:33:19,798
- Are you scared?
- Hmm?

413
00:33:20,000 --> 00:33:23,629
- Are you scared?
- Scared? No.

414
00:33:23,840 --> 00:33:27,196
Nobody's ever really alone.
Did you know that?

415
00:33:27,400 --> 00:33:30,551
As a matter of fact,
I'm expecting company right now.

416
00:33:30,760 --> 00:33:33,752
Would you like me to introduce you?
Are you sure?

417
00:33:33,960 --> 00:33:35,393
Absolutely sure?

418
00:33:35,600 --> 00:33:38,160
Don't go away.

419
00:33:56,280 --> 00:33:59,078
- There.
- Oh!

420
00:33:59,280 --> 00:34:04,070
Isn't she pretty? Her name is Thumbelina.
Say hello, Thumbelina.

421
00:34:04,280 --> 00:34:06,032
Now you say hello to her.

422
00:34:06,240 --> 00:34:07,514
Hello.

423
00:34:10,240 --> 00:34:12,196
She's very unhappy.

424
00:34:12,400 --> 00:34:14,356
What's the matter, Thumbelina?

425
00:34:15,560 --> 00:34:18,028
Are you unhappy because you're so little?

426
00:34:18,240 --> 00:34:21,232
That's nothing to make
such a sad face about, is it?

427
00:34:21,440 --> 00:34:23,396
Here. Come on.

428
00:34:23,600 --> 00:34:26,990
Though you're no bigger than my thumb

429
00:34:27,200 --> 00:34:30,749
Than my thumb, than my thumb

430
00:34:30,960 --> 00:34:33,713
Sweet Thumbelina, don't be glum

431
00:34:34,520 --> 00:34:37,910
Now, now, now, ah, ah, ah,
come, come, come

432
00:34:38,120 --> 00:34:41,954
Thumbelina, Thumbelina

Thumbelina dance, Thumbelina sing

434
00:34:45,320 --> 00:34:48,949
Oh, Thumbelina, what's the difference
if you're very small?

435
00:34:49,160 --> 00:34:53,551
When your heart is full of love,
you're nine feet tall!

436
00:34:53,760 --> 00:34:58,550
Oh, she's still unhappy. What's the matter,
Thumbie? Would you like a playmate?

437
00:34:58,760 --> 00:35:00,352
You would? Here.

438

There. Say how do you do.

439

Want a kiss?

440

Would you like to dance?
You would? Well, here we go.

00:36:09,680 --> 00:36:11,352
Straight!

457
00:36:11,560 --> 00:36:13,676
Keep the line straight!

458
00:36:13,880 --> 00:36:15,233
Up! Up!

459
00:36:17,040 --> 00:36:18,996
Good.

460
00:37:00,720 --> 00:37:04,395
- This is the most...
- Shh! Dress rehearsal.

461
00:39:52,560 --> 00:39:55,154
All right.

462
00:39:55,360 --> 00:39:57,316
We'll do it all over again.

463
00:39:58,360 --> 00:40:03,229
Ladies, the pirouettes were impossible.
Gentlemen, the lifts have to be higher.

464
00:40:03,440 --> 00:40:06,591
The ballerina's performance
I won't begin to discuss.

465
00:40:06,800 --> 00:40:10,110
That would take till tomorrow morning.
We'll do it again.

466
00:40:10,320 --> 00:40:12,276
Not with these shoes, darling.

467
00:40:12,480 --> 00:40:15,199
I told you before, remember?

468
00:40:16,880 --> 00:40:19,553
Stop! Everything stop.

469
00:40:19,760 --> 00:40:21,079
Is the cobbler here yet?

470
00:40:22,520 --> 00:40:25,956
- Here I am.
- Come up here, cobbler.

471
00:40:27,520 --> 00:40:29,795
Come on. Hurry up!

472
00:40:36,720 --> 00:40:40,429
Cobbler, this lady will explain to you
what she wants you to do.

473
00:40:40,640 --> 00:40:45,998
It's a trifle complicated, but she's no
ordinary dancer. She's something special.

474
00:40:46,200 --> 00:40:50,716
Of all the dancers in Denmark, she is
the only one who cannot follow my steps

475
00:40:50,920 --> 00:40:54,037
without special shoes
that exist only in her mind.

476
00:40:54,240 --> 00:40:56,879
All this she will make clear
to you, perhaps.

477
00:40:57,080 --> 00:40:59,799
We cannot understand
so great a ballerina

478
00:41:00,000 --> 00:41:03,197
We must only bow to her every wish.

479
00:41:03,400 --> 00:41:05,470
Not quite low enough, my dear!

480
00:41:05,680 --> 00:41:09,992
Come, sir. We can talk more quietly
over there, I think.

481
00:41:13,720 --> 00:41:15,995
<i>Lunch, everybody.</i>

482
00:41:19,200 --> 00:41:21,668
You've seen the ballet
when I make a jeté?

483
00:41:21,880 --> 00:41:24,474
You know - when I jump.

484
00:41:24,680 --> 00:41:27,319
I want to rise and then remain motionless,

485
00:41:27,520 --> 00:41:31,638
as though I were standing
on nothing but air.

486
00:41:31,840 --> 00:41:34,718
It is impossible with these shoes,

487
00:41:34,920 --> 00:41:40,153
but if you could put something in the tip
of each one, I could do it, I'm sure I could,

488
00:41:40,360 --> 00:41:43,158
in spite of that unkind man.

489
00:41:43,360 --> 00:41:46,636
I would so love to show him
it is not impossible.

490
00:41:46,840 --> 00:41:48,796
It is possible, isn't it?

491
00:41:49,000 --> 00:41:50,433
Could you do it?

492
00:41:50,640 --> 00:41:52,596
Yes.

493
00:41:52,800 --> 00:41:55,155
Yes, I can do it.

494
00:41:55,360 --> 00:41:57,316
I'll find something.

495
00:41:57,520 --> 00:41:59,397
Something soft and silent.

496
00:41:59,600 --> 00:42:01,192
I'm sure I can do it.

497
00:42:01,400 --> 00:42:05,234
- You could really seem to stand on air.
- You have it!

498
00:42:05,440 --> 00:42:08,079
I can see you have the idea perfectly.

499
00:42:08,280 --> 00:42:10,840
I shall be so grateful to you.

500
00:42:11,040 --> 00:42:14,271
There, can you do it now - quickly?

501
00:42:14,480 --> 00:42:19,838
It would be such a service.
I would be forever grateful. Thank you.

502
00:42:20,040 --> 00:42:21,996
Louise, my slippers!

503
00:42:25,240 --> 00:42:27,356
<i>You have to go out this way.</i>

504
00:42:29,720 --> 00:42:31,676
Hans!

505
00:42:31,880 --> 00:42:35,350
Goodness, you were a long time!
Have we got a job?

506
00:42:36,200 --> 00:42:38,668
- What are you holding?
- Slippers.

507
00:42:38,880 --> 00:42:43,590
Slippers? I never saw slippers like that
before. Who wears a thing like that?

508
00:42:43,800 --> 00:42:47,349
- The loveliest lady I've ever seen.
- Why does she wear these?

509
00:42:47,560 --> 00:42:50,711
She dances - no, she floats.

510
00:42:50,920 --> 00:42:54,310
When she smiles, your heart skips
a beat and then melts.

511
00:42:54,520 --> 00:42:57,671
She smiled and stood close to me.
She even touched me.

512
00:42:58,720 --> 00:42:59,994
Where's the barrow?

513
00:43:00,200 --> 00:43:03,556
- I promised these to her quickly.
- Right over here.

514
00:43:04,280 --> 00:43:07,078
I hid it here in the theatre storeroom.

515
00:43:07,280 --> 00:43:11,353
She wants shoes that will walk on air,
Peter. This afternoon.

516
00:43:11,560 --> 00:43:13,949
Well, she'll have them.

517
00:43:14,160 --> 00:43:17,311
I wish she had asked me something
really impossible.

518
00:43:31,760 --> 00:43:33,478
Doro...

519
00:43:33,680 --> 00:43:35,636
Are you hungry?

520
00:43:38,960 --> 00:43:40,916
Do you love me?

521
00:43:41,120 --> 00:43:44,510
Yes, even half-starved, I love you.

522
00:43:45,760 --> 00:43:47,716
Come.

523
00:43:47,920 --> 00:43:49,876
Sit down. Let me feed you.

524
00:43:50,840 --> 00:43:54,799
Here. A sip of this to put you
in a better temper.

525
00:43:55,000 --> 00:43:56,956
And, look.

526
00:43:57,160 --> 00:44:00,232
I asked Helga to make this especially
for you today.

527
00:44:00,440 --> 00:44:02,396
My darling, was I cruel today?

528
00:44:02,600 --> 00:44:06,309
Oh, you were, my friend. You were indeed.

529
00:44:06,520 --> 00:44:08,636
I was almost in tears.

530
00:44:08,840 --> 00:44:12,549
- Doro, I'm sorry.
- Niels, don't be sorry.

531
00:44:12,760 --> 00:44:15,957
It's just as it should be.
Don't you see that, my angel?

532
00:44:16,160 --> 00:44:21,109
Professionally, we fight like two tigers,
but afterwards...

533
00:44:21,320 --> 00:44:24,835
That's what makes it so good afterwards.

534
00:44:26,200 --> 00:44:28,156
Isn't it good now?

535
00:44:28,360 --> 00:44:32,911
It's wonderful. Why do I forget that
the minute you start to dance?

536
00:44:33,120 --> 00:44:36,749
Then I see only my mortal enemy -
the ballerina - in front of me.

537
00:44:36,960 --> 00:44:39,952
Because the ballet is your life,
just as it is mine.

538
00:44:40,160 --> 00:44:44,438
Don't you think I sometimes forget
you are my husband when I am dancing,

539
00:44:44,640 --> 00:44:47,996
and want to kill you
for some of the things you say?

540
00:44:48,200 --> 00:44:50,111
You really want to kill me?

541
00:44:50,320 --> 00:44:54,199
Of course I do. Isn't that as it should be?

542
00:44:54,400 --> 00:44:57,472
I would hate it any other way,
wouldn't you?

543
00:44:57,680 --> 00:45:02,549
Oh, Niels, we are lucky,
and I do love you so.

544
00:45:13,160 --> 00:45:19,156
I'm sorry about the shoes. I will behave
beautifully this afternoon, you will see.

545
00:45:19,360 --> 00:45:23,876
- Sorry about the shoes?
- There was nothing wrong with them.

546
00:45:24,960 --> 00:45:27,679
I just did that to torment you.

547
00:45:27,880 --> 00:45:29,836
Oh, you did?

548
00:45:30,040 --> 00:45:33,112
I know exactly how to torment you,
don't I, darling?

549
00:45:33,320 --> 00:45:37,279
And you look so wonderfully poetic
when you are in a rage, my dear.

550
00:45:38,360 --> 00:45:43,036
Never mind how I look. So you just made
up that little bit about the shoes, huh?

551
00:45:43,240 --> 00:45:45,913
But you were being terrible.
You deserved it.

552
00:45:46,120 --> 00:45:50,318
You let everyone sit around
while you took your petty revenge?

553
00:45:50,520 --> 00:45:54,832
You forget what you said in front
of the entire company about my dancing?

554
00:45:55,040 --> 00:45:57,759
No, I don't. I remember every word of it.

555
00:45:57,960 --> 00:46:00,428
- I was right!
- Oh, you were?

556
00:46:00,640 --> 00:46:04,838
Yes, and if you've finished stuffing
yourself, I can say it again

557
00:46:05,040 --> 00:46:07,600
because we're going
back to the rehearsal.

558
00:46:07,800 --> 00:46:10,951
You danced the waltz
like an elephant in a snowdrift!

559
00:46:11,800 --> 00:46:13,119
What did you say?

560
00:46:13,320 --> 00:46:17,279
I said you danced the waltz
like an elephant in a snowdrift!

561
00:46:17,480 --> 00:46:21,996
No, like an elephant who fell down
and was trying to get up!

562
00:46:22,200 --> 00:46:24,475
Can you hear me? Is that loud enough?

563
00:46:24,680 --> 00:46:29,708
How dare you! I slave to make
each step you give me just right.

564
00:46:29,920 --> 00:46:33,913
I make your foolish little dance steps
acceptable to an audience.

565
00:46:34,120 --> 00:46:38,238
You don't slave hard enough.
Move in time to the music once in a while!

566
00:46:38,440 --> 00:46:42,911
You are not just cruel, you are heartless.
Completely heartless.

567
00:46:43,120 --> 00:46:48,638
You love to say cruel things to me! You
would like to see me grovel at your feet!

568
00:46:48,840 --> 00:46:52,389
- You'd see those steps clearer that way!
- How can I stand it?

569
00:46:52,600 --> 00:46:54,113
How do I bear it?

570
00:46:54,320 --> 00:46:58,154
Come - you can cry harder than that.
I've heard you cry much harder.

571
00:47:05,400 --> 00:47:08,551
That, my girl, is for thinking up
those shoes.

572
00:47:09,640 --> 00:47:11,596
On stage, everybody!

573
00:47:11,800 --> 00:47:15,634
Let's see what you can think up
for this afternoon's rehearsal.

574
00:47:15,840 --> 00:47:18,070
You've fixed the shoes? Good.

575
00:47:18,280 --> 00:47:20,999
- Do you see what he's doing to her?
- Of course.

576
00:47:21,200 --> 00:47:26,991
Never interfere between a husband
and wife. It's the best rule I ever heard of.

577
00:47:27,200 --> 00:47:29,760
You mean she's married to him?

578
00:47:29,960 --> 00:47:33,953
- To that man?
- Very much married. Outside, please.

579
00:47:34,160 --> 00:47:39,029
No one is allowed in the theatre during
rehearsal. That's another very good rule.

580
00:47:39,240 --> 00:47:42,073
How much do we owe you
for the shoes, my boy?

581
00:47:53,960 --> 00:47:55,791
How could you do it?

582
00:47:56,000 --> 00:47:59,390
How could a girl like you
marry a man like that?

583
00:47:59,600 --> 00:48:01,716
How can I help you?

584
00:48:01,920 --> 00:48:04,115
<i>Dance! Dance!</i>

585
00:48:04,320 --> 00:48:07,118
Dance! Dance!

586
00:48:07,320 --> 00:48:09,311
Dance!

587
00:48:29,760 --> 00:48:31,716
<i>Help me!</i>

588
00:48:31,920 --> 00:48:33,876
<i>Help me!</i>

589
00:48:34,080 --> 00:48:36,036
<i>Help me!</i>

590
00:48:46,920 --> 00:48:48,876
<i>Help me!</i>

591
00:50:19,760 --> 00:50:21,557
<i>Cobbler?</i>

592
00:50:21,760 --> 00:50:28,438
Cobbler! Thank you for the shoes. You
left before I had a chance to thank you.

593
00:50:28,640 --> 00:50:30,596
They were wonderful.

594
00:50:30,800 --> 00:50:34,634
I really floated on air. Thank you.

595
00:50:42,200 --> 00:50:43,713
Thank you.

596
00:50:46,960 --> 00:50:49,713
Don't tell me what to do!
They'll work tomorrow.

597
00:50:49,920 --> 00:50:54,391
They'll work till they get it right.
I'll see them drop in their tracks.

598
00:50:54,600 --> 00:50:57,876
And you have my coat ready for me
when I'm ready to leave!

599
00:51:04,160 --> 00:51:05,559
Home!

600
00:51:23,080 --> 00:51:25,355
What funny people they are over there.

601
00:51:25,560 --> 00:51:31,032
They laugh and kiss, then they scream
and beat each other. Kind of crazy.

602
00:51:33,080 --> 00:51:35,036
What are you doing, Hans?

603
00:51:35,240 --> 00:51:38,471
- Writing.
- A letter? To the children?

604
00:51:38,680 --> 00:51:42,036
- Say something for me to them.
- It's not to the children.

605
00:51:42,240 --> 00:51:45,471
What? Who are you writing to, Hans?

606
00:51:45,680 --> 00:51:47,636
The ballerina.

607
00:51:47,840 --> 00:51:50,115
Stop bothering me, Peter.

608
00:51:53,440 --> 00:51:56,796
Why are you writing
to the ballerina, Hans?

609
00:51:57,000 --> 00:52:01,915
I heard him talk to her.
I saw him slap her face.

610
00:52:02,120 --> 00:52:05,078
But, Hans, they're married.

611
00:52:06,560 --> 00:52:08,516
I know that.

612
00:52:08,720 --> 00:52:11,439
I heard them talking
before you came in, Hans.

613
00:52:11,640 --> 00:52:14,200
It was different.

614
00:52:14,400 --> 00:52:17,836
Look, Peter, you're a child.
You don't understand.

615
00:52:18,880 --> 00:52:21,075
I saw him make her cry with my own eyes.

616
00:52:21,280 --> 00:52:23,555
- But, Hans, they...
- Don't bother me.

617
00:52:23,760 --> 00:52:26,320
I must finish this tonight.

618
00:52:41,520 --> 00:52:47,311
<i>"The Little Mermaid.
A story for Mademoiselle Doro.</i>

619
00:52:48,720 --> 00:52:55,876
"And so, gradually, the little mermaid
began to understand.

620
00:52:56,080 --> 00:53:01,677
"She had sought love
from the wrong man."

621
00:53:35,760 --> 00:53:37,716
Come in.

622
00:53:39,160 --> 00:53:42,675
I'm sorry, sir, but he insisted
on seeing you immediately.

623
00:53:42,880 --> 00:53:47,158
Shh. She's asleep. What's the trouble,
doorman? Who's this little boy?

624
00:53:47,360 --> 00:53:52,753
This is addressed to Mademoiselle Doro.
He was in the theatre trying to take it.

625
00:53:52,960 --> 00:53:55,838
It seems to be a story,
and it is addressed to her.

626
00:53:56,040 --> 00:53:57,996
Why were you trying to take it?

627
00:53:58,200 --> 00:54:03,797
- I wasn't trying to steal it. It's mine.
- Then why is it addressed to my wife?

628
00:54:04,000 --> 00:54:08,278
- Niels, what is all this?
- It's mine! Please give it to me. It's mine!

629
00:54:09,480 --> 00:54:11,277
Now, who wrote this?

630
00:54:12,280 --> 00:54:14,032
I did.

631
00:54:14,240 --> 00:54:16,276
You did?

632
00:54:21,840 --> 00:54:25,753
Suppose you tell me why you happened
to write this story to my wife?

633
00:54:25,960 --> 00:54:27,916
It's nothing to do with you or her.

634
00:54:28,120 --> 00:54:31,237
It's just a story.
He made up a story, that's all.

635
00:54:31,440 --> 00:54:34,955
He's always making up stories,
and he made up this one.

636
00:54:35,160 --> 00:54:37,720
Now would you mind telling me
just who he is?

637
00:54:37,920 --> 00:54:42,675
We know you didn't write it, so you might
just as well stop lying. Who is he?

638
00:54:42,880 --> 00:54:44,233
A friend of mine.

639
00:54:44,440 --> 00:54:45,793
What's his name?

640
00:54:46,000 --> 00:54:50,437
Hans... Christian Andersen. The cobbler.

641
00:54:54,000 --> 00:54:55,991
Darling, it's the cobbler.

642
00:54:56,200 --> 00:54:59,476
The cobbler who fixed my shoes
so beautifully yesterday.

643
00:54:59,680 --> 00:55:02,592
He's written me a story for a ballet.

644
00:55:02,800 --> 00:55:06,588
- I don't believe it!
- Tell the cobbler I am delighted to have it.

645
00:55:06,800 --> 00:55:09,633
What was his name - Hans?
I will read it carefully.

646
00:55:11,320 --> 00:55:13,959
<i>- The Little Mermaid
- Stop it.</i>

647
00:55:14,160 --> 00:55:17,197
It is all very innocent and quite touching.

648
00:55:19,800 --> 00:55:21,756
I haven't said good morning yet.

649
00:55:23,120 --> 00:55:25,076
Good morning, darling.

650
00:55:45,480 --> 00:55:49,268
Where have you been?
I've lost it. I can't find it any place.

651
00:55:49,480 --> 00:55:52,040
Help me look, will you, Peter?

652
00:55:52,240 --> 00:55:54,913
Just when I need you most,
you disappear.

653
00:55:55,120 --> 00:55:57,429
I'll have to write it all over again.

654
00:55:57,640 --> 00:56:01,758
- You don't have to write it again.
- Don't stand there. Start looking.

655
00:56:01,960 --> 00:56:04,679
- You don't have to write it over again.
- What?

656
00:56:04,880 --> 00:56:06,438
She's got it.

657
00:56:11,120 --> 00:56:13,076
What did you say?

658
00:56:13,280 --> 00:56:16,238
She has it, Hans. Right now.

659
00:56:16,440 --> 00:56:18,396
She has?

660
00:56:18,600 --> 00:56:20,636
But how? How did she get it?

661
00:56:23,280 --> 00:56:26,078
I was reading it
and it blew out of my hands.

662
00:56:27,200 --> 00:56:29,156
You took it?

663
00:56:29,360 --> 00:56:32,477
But why? Never mind that, Peter. Go on.

664
00:56:32,680 --> 00:56:36,150
It blew into the window
of the theatre, and...

665
00:56:37,480 --> 00:56:39,436
That's how she got it.

666
00:56:40,600 --> 00:56:42,556
A wind took it to her.

667
00:56:42,760 --> 00:56:45,513
It's an omen, Peter. An omen.

668
00:56:47,480 --> 00:56:50,119
She's reading it now.

669
00:56:55,080 --> 00:56:57,036
Don't go over there, Hans, don't.

670
00:56:57,240 --> 00:57:00,391
I must, Peter. I've got to talk to her.
I can help her.

671
00:57:02,600 --> 00:57:06,479
That chair and this sofa.
Let's get 'em on the wagon.

672
00:57:06,680 --> 00:57:09,513
What's going on here?
What are you doing?

673
00:57:09,720 --> 00:57:11,392
The ballet's moving out.

674
00:57:12,440 --> 00:57:14,396
Moving out?

675
00:57:19,800 --> 00:57:21,199
Excuse me.

676
00:57:21,400 --> 00:57:25,757
- Is it true the ballet's moving out?
- That's right. Their yearly tour.

677
00:57:25,960 --> 00:57:28,872
Where to? How long will they be gone?

678
00:57:59,240 --> 00:58:02,676
There's the school bell.
Off to school. Hurry up.

679
00:58:02,880 --> 00:58:06,668
Off with you now. Tomorrow's
another day and another story.

680
00:58:07,560 --> 00:58:12,554
I don't want any trouble with
the schoolmaster. Hurry, children. Hurry.

681
00:58:17,440 --> 00:58:19,556
What's the matter? Are you unhappy?

682
00:58:23,120 --> 00:58:27,272
Would you like me to tell you
a special story?

683
00:58:27,480 --> 00:58:29,152
Come on up here.

684
00:58:31,560 --> 00:58:33,516
Come on.

685
00:58:40,280 --> 00:58:43,556
I'm not going to hurt you.
Go up a little faster.

686
00:58:45,560 --> 00:58:48,393
Now, let me see...

687
00:58:52,560 --> 00:58:57,156
There once was an ugly duckling

688
00:58:57,360 --> 00:59:00,716
With feathers all stubby and brown

689
00:59:00,920 --> 00:59:07,792
And the other birds, in so many words
said, "Ptt! Get out of town!

690
00:59:08,000 --> 00:59:09,831
"Ptt! Get out!

691
00:59:10,040 --> 00:59:15,239
"Ptt! Ptt! Get out!
Ptt! Ptt! Get out of town!"

692
00:59:15,440 --> 00:59:18,796
And he went with a quack
and a waddle and a quack

693
00:59:19,000 --> 00:59:22,356
In a flurry of eiderdown

694
00:59:23,360 --> 00:59:25,794
Shall I tell you the rest of the story?

695
00:59:26,000 --> 00:59:27,956
All right.

696
00:59:29,280 --> 00:59:32,795
That poor little ugly duckling

697
00:59:33,000 --> 00:59:36,276
Went wandering far and near

698
00:59:36,480 --> 00:59:39,756
But at every place,
they said to his face

699
00:59:39,960 --> 00:59:43,270
"Now, ptt! Get out of here

700
00:59:44,000 --> 00:59:47,037
"Ptt! Get out! Ptt! Ptt! Get out!

701
00:59:47,240 --> 00:59:50,437
"Ptt! Ptt! Get out of here!"

702
00:59:50,640 --> 00:59:54,155
And he went with a quack
and a waddle and a quack

703
00:59:54,360 --> 00:59:58,069
And a very unhappy tear

704
01:00:05,280 --> 01:00:10,229
All through the wintertime,
he hid himself away

705
01:00:10,440 --> 01:00:16,390
Ashamed to show his face,
afraid of what others might say

706
01:00:16,600 --> 01:00:22,391
All through the winter,
in his lonely clump of weed

707
01:00:22,600 --> 01:00:28,357
Till a flock of swans spied him there
and very soon agreed

708
01:00:28,560 --> 01:00:34,999
"You're a very fine swan indeed!"

709
01:00:35,200 --> 01:00:36,474
"A swan?

710
01:00:36,680 --> 01:00:39,114
"Me a swan? Nah, go on."

711
01:00:39,320 --> 01:00:43,598
They said, "Yes, you're a swan.
Look at yourself in the lake. You'll see."

712
01:00:43,800 --> 01:00:47,759
<i>And he looked and he saw
and he said, "I am a swan!</i>

713
01:00:47,960 --> 01:00:49,837
"Whee!"

714
01:00:50,040 --> 01:00:53,669
I'm not such an ugly duckling

715
01:00:53,880 --> 01:00:56,917
No feathers all stubby and brown

716
01:00:57,120 --> 01:01:01,033
For, in fact, these birds,
in so many words said, "Tsk!

717
01:01:01,240 --> 01:01:03,435
"The best in town!

718
01:01:03,640 --> 01:01:06,598
"Tsk! The best! Tsk! Tsk! The best!

719
01:01:06,800 --> 01:01:09,598
"Tsk! Tsk! The best in town!"

720
01:01:09,800 --> 01:01:12,872
Not a quack, not a quack,
not a waddle or a quack

721
01:01:13,080 --> 01:01:17,710
But a glide and a whistle
and a snowy white back

722
01:01:17,920 --> 01:01:23,631
And a head so noble and high

723
01:01:23,840 --> 01:01:27,719
Say who's an ugly duckling?

724
01:01:27,920 --> 01:01:30,150
Not I!

725
01:01:36,520 --> 01:01:38,112
Not I!

726
01:01:38,320 --> 01:01:42,518
So, Lars, it shouldn't make any difference
if they won't play with you.

727
01:01:42,720 --> 01:01:45,188
But it does. I want to play with them,

728
01:01:45,400 --> 01:01:49,916
but they make fun of me because I was
sick and the doctor shaved my head.

729
01:01:50,120 --> 01:01:53,192
Yes, but look at what happened
to the ugly duckling.

730
01:01:53,400 --> 01:01:55,755
One day soon, you'll look in the mirror -

731
01:01:55,960 --> 01:01:58,349
much sooner than you think -

732
01:01:58,560 --> 01:02:03,429
and your hair will be grown out,
and you'll be just like the ugly duckling.

733
01:02:03,640 --> 01:02:06,279
You'll be better than any of them,
I promise.

734
01:02:06,480 --> 01:02:10,155
- Are you sure, Hans?
- Very sure.

735
01:02:11,000 --> 01:02:14,390
You'd better run off to school.
You're late now.

736
01:02:14,600 --> 01:02:16,556
- Bye, Hans.
- Goodbye.

737
01:02:22,640 --> 01:02:26,235
Cobbler, are my shoes ready?

738
01:02:26,440 --> 01:02:29,557
Yes, ma'am. I have them here.
One mark, please.

739
01:02:29,760 --> 01:02:34,356
- One mark? As much as that?
- Yes, ma'am. They're practically new.

740
01:02:36,400 --> 01:02:38,277
How beautiful!

741
01:02:38,480 --> 01:02:40,436
What kind of shoes are they?

742
01:02:41,280 --> 01:02:44,909
Ballet slippers. I made them myself.
Every inch of them.

743
01:02:45,120 --> 01:02:47,076
How lovely they are!

744
01:02:47,280 --> 01:02:50,192
Please, ma'am. They might soil.
You understand.

745
01:02:50,400 --> 01:02:52,356
Who wears such lovely things?

746
01:02:52,560 --> 01:02:56,269
A lady who dances.
Her feet twinkle like little stars.

747
01:02:57,480 --> 01:03:02,076
I assure you, the slippers won't even
be noticed - she's so beautiful herself.

748
01:03:03,520 --> 01:03:05,476
Thank you.

749
01:03:06,360 --> 01:03:09,352
Thank you. Please come again.

750
01:03:53,960 --> 01:03:59,080
Her arms were warm
as they welcomed me

751
01:03:59,280 --> 01:04:03,319
Her eyes were fire-bright

752
01:04:03,840 --> 01:04:08,470
And then I knew that my path must be

753
01:04:08,680 --> 01:04:13,754
Through the ever haunted night

754
01:04:13,960 --> 01:04:19,956
For anywhere I wander

755
01:04:20,160 --> 01:04:24,233
Anywhere I roam

756
01:04:24,800 --> 01:04:30,989
Till I'm in the arms of my darling again

757
01:04:31,200 --> 01:04:36,228
My heart will find no home

758
01:04:37,480 --> 01:04:42,270
Anywhere I wander

759
01:04:43,240 --> 01:04:46,994
Anywhere I roam

760
01:05:13,480 --> 01:05:18,873
Anywhere I wander

761
01:05:20,560 --> 01:05:27,113
Anywhere I roam

762
01:05:48,560 --> 01:05:51,358
- You're Hans the cobbler?
- Yes, sir.

763
01:05:51,560 --> 01:05:54,120
- I'm pleased to know you.
- How do you do?

764
01:05:54,320 --> 01:05:56,959
You've no idea what this is
all about, have you?

765
01:05:57,160 --> 01:06:00,311
- No, sir.
- Well, I'm the father of the ugly duckling.

766
01:06:00,520 --> 01:06:05,719
- Does that mean anything to you?
- Oh, you're Lars' father. I see.

767
01:06:05,920 --> 01:06:10,072
That little story helped him
over a bad time. I'm very grateful to you.

768
01:06:10,280 --> 01:06:14,159
When I made inquiries, I found
you had a lot more of these stories.

769
01:06:14,360 --> 01:06:18,319
The children are full of them these days.
Do you ever write any of them?

770
01:06:18,520 --> 01:06:22,035
- No, sir.
- Well, I've a little surprise for you. Come.

771
01:06:23,560 --> 01:06:25,710
Give me a small sheet of paper.

772
01:06:47,720 --> 01:06:49,676
Oh!

773
01:06:49,880 --> 01:06:51,836
Oh!

774
01:06:53,240 --> 01:06:55,879
Thank you very much.

775
01:06:59,880 --> 01:07:04,396
- It's the finest present I've ever had.
- I'm delighted. Lars will be, too.

776
01:07:08,040 --> 01:07:10,838
Could I say something, sir?
You wouldn't mind?

777
01:07:11,040 --> 01:07:13,759
Of course not. Say anything you want to.

778
01:07:13,960 --> 01:07:17,316
Well, instead of "Hans the cobbler",

779
01:07:17,520 --> 01:07:21,195
could it say "Hans Christian
Andersen", like a real writer?

780
01:07:21,960 --> 01:07:23,234
Certainly!

781
01:07:23,440 --> 01:07:28,639
If you write some of those stories down,
just the way you tell them to the children,

782
01:07:28,840 --> 01:07:32,879
I'll print them, and pay you for them.

783
01:07:34,960 --> 01:07:37,474
I can hardly believe it!

784
01:07:38,560 --> 01:07:40,755
- When will this be in the paper?
- Tomorrow.

785
01:07:40,960 --> 01:07:45,954
It'll say "Hans Christian Andersen"
all day tomorrow.

786
01:07:46,160 --> 01:07:48,196
All day?

787
01:07:50,000 --> 01:07:53,231
- Well, goodbye, sir.
- Goodbye.

788
01:07:54,480 --> 01:07:56,436
All day?

789
01:07:58,280 --> 01:08:02,068
<i>- Thank you, sir.
- Thank you.</i>

790
01:08:07,880 --> 01:08:13,318
<i>"The Ugly Duckling
by Hans Christian Andersen."</i>

791
01:08:14,960 --> 01:08:17,315
I'm Hans Christian Andersen

792
01:08:18,480 --> 01:08:21,199
That fortune has smiled upon

793
01:08:21,400 --> 01:08:25,313
Although I'm a duckling today,
tomorrow I'm a swan

794
01:08:25,520 --> 01:08:29,752
A tale I told and it turned to gold,
as gold as a tale can be

795
01:08:29,960 --> 01:08:34,078
I laugh, ha ha, but I blush a bit
for I realise while I'm reading it

796
01:08:34,280 --> 01:08:36,032
That it's also reading me

797
01:08:36,240 --> 01:08:38,800
"By Hans Christian Andersen"!

798
01:08:39,000 --> 01:08:41,070
<i>I am a swan!</i>

799
01:08:41,280 --> 01:08:44,829
I write myself a note each day
and I place it in my hat

800
01:08:45,040 --> 01:08:48,669
The wind comes by, the hat blows high
but that's not the end of that

801
01:08:48,880 --> 01:08:53,112
For round and round the world it goes
It lands here right behind myself

802
01:08:53,320 --> 01:08:57,677
I pick it up and I read the note
which is merely to remind myself

803
01:08:57,880 --> 01:08:59,836
I'm Hans Christian Andersen

804
01:09:00,040 --> 01:09:01,837
Andersen...

805
01:09:02,040 --> 01:09:03,996
Peter!

806
01:09:07,480 --> 01:09:10,040
I'm Hans Christian Andersen

807
01:09:10,240 --> 01:09:12,276
I bring you a fable rare

808
01:09:12,480 --> 01:09:17,076
There once was a table who said,
"How I'd love a chair"

809
01:09:17,280 --> 01:09:20,590
And then and there
came a sweet young chair

810
01:09:20,800 --> 01:09:23,598
All dressed in a bridal gown

811
01:09:23,800 --> 01:09:26,837
He said to her in a voice so true

812
01:09:27,040 --> 01:09:31,079
"Now I did not say I would marry you,
but I would like to sit down"

813
01:09:31,280 --> 01:09:33,157
I'm Hans Christian Andersen

814
01:09:33,360 --> 01:09:35,316
Andersen's in town!

815
01:09:40,560 --> 01:09:44,439
<i>"The Ugly Duckling
by... Hans the Cobbler"!</i>

816
01:09:44,640 --> 01:09:47,108
You're looking at a writer. A real writer.

817
01:09:47,320 --> 01:09:51,518
Tomorrow, the newspaper will say,
"Hans Christian Andersen" all day!

818
01:09:51,720 --> 01:09:54,393
- Was that what the newspaper wanted?
- Yes.

819
01:09:54,600 --> 01:09:56,909
They've printed one of your stories!

820
01:09:57,120 --> 01:10:01,318
And the way it happened
is like a story in itself. Wait till you hear.

821
01:10:01,520 --> 01:10:05,229
Peter, from now on, if anybody
asks you who you're working for,

822
01:10:05,440 --> 01:10:06,714
you can say a writer.

823
01:10:06,920 --> 01:10:09,992
You are working for a real writer!

824
01:10:13,960 --> 01:10:16,679
<i>"The Ugly Duckling by Hans the Cobbler."</i>

825
01:10:16,880 --> 01:10:18,836
I can hardly believe it!

826
01:10:19,040 --> 01:10:20,996
Peter...

827
01:10:23,480 --> 01:10:25,232
Can you imagine...

828
01:10:25,440 --> 01:10:27,954
Can you imagine
the schoolmaster's face?

829
01:10:28,160 --> 01:10:30,913
One day, a newspaper
arrives from Copenhagen.

830
01:10:31,120 --> 01:10:34,192
He opens it up and he looks,
and suddenly...

831
01:10:34,880 --> 01:10:39,032
He can't believe his eyes!
"Hans Christian Andersen?" he says.

832
01:10:39,240 --> 01:10:41,231
"Hans the cobbler?

833
01:10:41,440 --> 01:10:44,318
"A story by Hans Christian Andersen?

834
01:10:45,480 --> 01:10:48,313
"Hmm. Fine story." Have a bite.

835
01:10:48,520 --> 01:10:52,957
- There's something on your hand.
- That must be from the printing machine.

836
01:10:55,280 --> 01:10:56,838
Peter...

837
01:10:57,040 --> 01:10:58,712
Look.

838
01:10:58,920 --> 01:11:03,038
- "Royal Danish Ballet returns from tour."
- Yes, Peter.

839
01:11:03,240 --> 01:11:04,639
She's back!

840
01:11:04,840 --> 01:11:06,512
Peter, she's back!

841
01:11:06,720 --> 01:11:09,518
What a day!
Everything is happening at once!

842
01:11:10,440 --> 01:11:13,113
Hans, we promised some shoes for today.

843
01:11:13,320 --> 01:11:16,153
I'll do it later. I couldn't possibly sit still.

844
01:11:16,360 --> 01:11:19,716
She's back! I've got to walk! She's back!

845
01:14:12,640 --> 01:14:14,596
Never before and never again

846
01:14:14,800 --> 01:14:16,756
Never before and never again

847
01:14:16,960 --> 01:14:19,235
No two people
have ever been so in love

848
01:14:19,440 --> 01:14:21,670
Been so in love

849
01:14:21,880 --> 01:14:23,871
Been so in love - it's incredible

850
01:14:24,080 --> 01:14:29,438
No two people have ever been so in love
As my lovey dove and I

851
01:14:29,640 --> 01:14:33,315
This is unique, the positive peak
We are the most unusual couple on earth

852
01:14:33,520 --> 01:14:38,071
No two people have ever mooned
such a moon, juned such a June

853
01:14:38,280 --> 01:14:39,599
Spooned such a spoon

854
01:14:39,800 --> 01:14:43,190
What he means is that no two people
have ever been so in tune

855
01:14:43,400 --> 01:14:46,198
As my macaroon and I

856
01:14:46,400 --> 01:14:47,753
And when we kiss

857
01:14:47,960 --> 01:14:52,397
- And when we kiss - what verse is this?
- It's hysterical, it's historical

858
01:14:52,600 --> 01:14:54,830
- Let me tell it
- Certainly, darling.

859
01:14:55,040 --> 01:14:57,508
No two people
have ever been so in love

860
01:14:57,720 --> 01:15:01,235
Been so in love

861
01:15:01,440 --> 01:15:04,830
It's impossible. No two people
have ever been so in love

862
01:15:05,040 --> 01:15:07,634
As my lovey dove and I

863
01:15:07,840 --> 01:15:09,193
This is the cream, the very extreme

864
01:15:09,400 --> 01:15:11,834
The sort of a dream
you couldn't imagine at all

865
01:15:12,040 --> 01:15:18,513
No two people have ever been so in love
as my lovey dove and I

866
01:15:22,480 --> 01:15:26,075
<i>No two people
have ever been so in love</i>

867
01:15:26,280 --> 01:15:29,636
Been so in love, been so in love

868
01:15:29,840 --> 01:15:33,150
No two people have ever been so in love

869
01:15:33,360 --> 01:15:36,989
As you and Mrs Hans Christian
Andersen!

870
01:15:37,200 --> 01:15:38,553
<i>Mrs Andersen.</i>

871
01:15:38,760 --> 01:15:40,637
<i>Mr Andersen.</i>

872
01:15:40,840 --> 01:15:42,558
Mrs Andersen.

873
01:15:42,760 --> 01:15:44,751
Mr Andersen.

874
01:15:45,160 --> 01:15:47,913
Mr Andersen?

875
01:15:48,120 --> 01:15:49,872
Mr Andersen?

876
01:15:50,640 --> 01:15:52,596
Mr Andersen?

877
01:15:52,800 --> 01:15:54,756
Mr Andersen?

878
01:15:54,960 --> 01:15:56,916
Mr Andersen!

879
01:15:57,760 --> 01:16:00,832
How sweet of you to be here
the very moment we return.

880
01:16:01,040 --> 01:16:03,838
How did you know we were going
to do your ballet?

881
01:16:05,080 --> 01:16:09,790
Never mind. Your real reward will come
tomorrow night when I dance it for you.

882
01:16:10,000 --> 01:16:11,956
You will come, won't you?

883
01:16:14,560 --> 01:16:17,996
Perhaps you will have words for me
by tomorrow night?

884
01:16:18,200 --> 01:16:20,156
Come, Louise.

885
01:16:25,960 --> 01:16:28,315
What would they say back in the village?

886
01:16:28,520 --> 01:16:32,149
You and me getting ready to go
to the opera house in Copenhagen.

887
01:16:32,360 --> 01:16:34,316
To see my ballet!

888
01:16:34,520 --> 01:16:36,750
Would they believe it? Never.

889
01:16:36,960 --> 01:16:41,875
"One of the cobbler's stories", they'd say.
"How can the children believe them?"

890
01:16:42,080 --> 01:16:46,676
But even I wouldn't dare make up a story
like this - and it happens to be true.

891
01:16:47,800 --> 01:16:50,234
Is it all right if I don't go with you?

892
01:16:50,440 --> 01:16:51,793
What?

893
01:16:56,480 --> 01:16:59,517
- I said is it all right if I don't go with you?
- No!

894
01:16:59,720 --> 01:17:04,840
It's not all right if you don't go with me.
What's the matter with you anyway?

895
01:17:05,040 --> 01:17:07,759
Something's wrong with you.

896
01:17:07,960 --> 01:17:10,315
Come inside.

897
01:17:22,680 --> 01:17:26,559
Now, what's the matter, Peter?
Come on. Out with it.

898
01:17:29,040 --> 01:17:33,556
I've been trying to tell you
something, Hans, all day.

899
01:17:35,480 --> 01:17:39,393
All right, Peter. Tell me now.

900
01:17:39,600 --> 01:17:43,718
It's hard for me, Hans.
I don't know how to say it.

901
01:17:46,480 --> 01:17:49,438
Never mind. Just say it.

902
01:17:51,280 --> 01:17:54,352
I tried once to tell you,
but you wouldn't listen.

903
01:17:54,560 --> 01:17:58,519
Then they went away,
and I thought you'd forget about it.

904
01:17:58,720 --> 01:18:01,917
- They?
- I don't like people who laugh at you.

905
01:18:02,120 --> 01:18:04,236
It hurts me when people laugh at you.

906
01:18:04,440 --> 01:18:08,353
Back in the village when they made
fun of you, I wanted to kill them.

907
01:18:08,560 --> 01:18:12,109
Laugh at me? What are you
talking about, Peter?

908
01:18:12,320 --> 01:18:15,710
Her and him. You don't understand them.

909
01:18:17,040 --> 01:18:18,837
What don't I understand?

910
01:18:19,040 --> 01:18:23,238
You're making up a story about them,
like you do about everything else,

911
01:18:23,440 --> 01:18:27,274
only this time it's about them,
not clocks and flowers and stars.

912
01:18:27,480 --> 01:18:31,109
- She'll laugh at you, Hans!
- So that's it.

913
01:18:31,320 --> 01:18:33,231
I thought so.

914
01:18:34,160 --> 01:18:36,879
Is she laughing at me
when she does my ballet?

915
01:18:37,080 --> 01:18:39,594
Was she laughing at me
when she kissed me?

916
01:18:40,840 --> 01:18:43,513
- She kissed you?
- Yes.

917
01:18:44,480 --> 01:18:46,675
You didn't know that, did you?

918
01:18:47,920 --> 01:18:52,994
- I don't care. It's true what I'm saying.
- I'm sorry you said that, Peter.

919
01:18:53,200 --> 01:18:57,671
You never lied to me before.
You don't have to come with me tonight.

920
01:18:59,560 --> 01:19:03,792
Maybe you'd better see if you can
find work with somebody else.

921
01:19:05,160 --> 01:19:08,391
You're old enough now
to be by yourself, and...

922
01:19:08,600 --> 01:19:12,036
...I think we'd better part company
altogether because...

923
01:19:14,480 --> 01:19:17,916
...because I don't think
we like each other any more.

924
01:20:10,440 --> 01:20:12,192
I beg your pardon.

925
01:20:12,400 --> 01:20:15,233
No one's allowed in
before the performance.

926
01:20:15,440 --> 01:20:18,238
I am Hans Christian Andersen.

927
01:20:18,440 --> 01:20:22,399
- The author of the ballet they're doing.
- Oh, good evening.

928
01:20:22,600 --> 01:20:25,797
Don't you read the posters
outside your own theatre?

929
01:20:26,000 --> 01:20:30,437
<i>Make it lower.
Up, down again, around - that's it.</i>

930
01:20:30,640 --> 01:20:32,596
That's it.

931
01:20:32,800 --> 01:20:34,756
Stay together.

932
01:20:34,960 --> 01:20:37,554
Around...

933
01:20:37,760 --> 01:20:40,513
Good. That's much better. Keep it up.

934
01:20:40,720 --> 01:20:44,474
That's it. Now go around.
Come around this way.

935
01:20:45,440 --> 01:20:47,476
Who are you? Get out of here at once.

936
01:20:47,680 --> 01:20:51,958
Don't deliver shoes before a performance!
Leave them with the doorman.

937
01:20:52,160 --> 01:20:55,232
- Try the arabesque again.
- The name is Andersen.

938
01:20:55,440 --> 01:20:59,558
- Hans Christian Andersen.
- Andersen? The ballet writer!

939
01:20:59,760 --> 01:21:03,070
I'd like to deliver these shoes
to Mademoiselle Doro.

940
01:21:03,280 --> 01:21:05,430
Be a good fellow and get out now.

941
01:21:05,640 --> 01:21:08,518
- Will you move the big shell upstage?
- Yes, sir.

942
01:21:08,720 --> 01:21:11,234
Go out front and watch your ballet.

943
01:21:11,440 --> 01:21:14,955
- I'll give her the shoes myself.
- No! Don't you touch them.

944
01:21:15,160 --> 01:21:18,948
You can't give them to her now.
No one sees her before an opening.

945
01:21:19,160 --> 01:21:21,833
<i>Can you show us
where you want the shell?</i>

946
01:21:22,040 --> 01:21:25,715
I can't be everywhere at once.
Just move it on stage.

947
01:21:27,040 --> 01:21:31,238
Will you please escort Mr Andersen
to the stage door? Quietly but firmly.

948
01:21:31,440 --> 01:21:33,192
But I have these...

949
01:21:33,400 --> 01:21:37,109
If you please, I'd like to leave alone.

950
01:21:54,160 --> 01:21:58,472
Not you again! Don't you understand
this is no time to bother anybody?

951
01:21:58,680 --> 01:22:01,353
Mademoiselle Doro
would not agree with you.

952
01:22:01,560 --> 01:22:04,916
Why am I plagued with authors
on opening nights? Why?

953
01:22:05,120 --> 01:22:09,033
- Overture in three minutes.
- In three minutes, we begin!

954
01:22:09,240 --> 01:22:11,913
Ladies, take your places!

955
01:22:16,920 --> 01:22:20,151
Open that door! Let me out of here!

956
01:22:53,560 --> 01:22:55,516
<i>I can see it.</i>

957
01:22:56,480 --> 01:22:59,040
<i>I don't have to see her with my eyes.</i>

958
01:22:59,240 --> 01:23:01,390
<i>I can see it all.</i>

959
01:37:28,480 --> 01:37:29,913
<i>Come in!</i>

960
01:37:30,120 --> 01:37:32,953
- Good morning, madame.
- Good morning, Céline.

961
01:37:33,160 --> 01:37:37,233
- It's not a very nice day, I'm afraid.
- It looks lovely to me, Céline.

962
01:37:37,440 --> 01:37:41,831
And how good it feels to be
back in my own room. It seems years.

963
01:37:42,040 --> 01:37:45,476
That it does, and what
a wonderful success last night!

964
01:37:45,680 --> 01:37:49,116
I can hardly ever remember
the audience being so excited.

965
01:37:49,320 --> 01:37:52,312
It was the new ballet.
They were enchanted with it.

966
01:37:52,520 --> 01:37:56,115
And it is enchanting. I love to dance it.

967
01:37:56,320 --> 01:37:58,072
What a curious fellow he is.

968
01:37:58,280 --> 01:38:01,238
- He never turned up at all.
- Who, madame?

969
01:38:01,440 --> 01:38:04,876
Hans, the cobbler. You know?

970
01:38:05,080 --> 01:38:09,790
I wonder if he was even there. Do you
suppose he was there and was too shy...

971
01:38:10,000 --> 01:38:13,231
- Good heavens!
- I thought you were fast asleep.

972
01:38:13,440 --> 01:38:18,116
- The cobbler's locked in the prop room!
- What are you talking about?

973
01:38:18,320 --> 01:38:22,199
I locked him up last night,
just before the performance. I had to.

974
01:38:22,400 --> 01:38:26,837
He insisted on giving you some shoes
five minutes before the ballet began.

975
01:38:27,040 --> 01:38:29,759
He never saw the ballet?
You kept him locked up?

976
01:38:29,960 --> 01:38:32,428
- I forgot, I tell you.
- You big fool!

977
01:38:32,640 --> 01:38:35,677
I had other things to think about just then!

978
01:38:35,880 --> 01:38:39,714
Quickly, Céline. Go to the theatre
and bring him back here.

979
01:38:39,920 --> 01:38:41,876
That poor dear man!

980
01:38:42,560 --> 01:38:46,439
And you, you monster,
you'd better stay under there.

981
01:38:46,640 --> 01:38:49,393
Try popping your head out
and see what you get.

982
01:38:49,600 --> 01:38:52,797
The lamp over it, I promise you!

983
01:38:58,680 --> 01:39:00,636
Oh, Hans.

984
01:39:00,840 --> 01:39:05,516
I shall call you Hans. What a dreadful
thing to have happened! Are you all right?

985
01:39:05,720 --> 01:39:10,077
It's just like him to have done
such a thing. Come.

986
01:39:10,280 --> 01:39:12,236
Sit down.

987
01:39:12,440 --> 01:39:15,318
- Would you like a cup of chocolate?
- No, thank you.

988
01:39:15,520 --> 01:39:19,593
You missed seeing the ballet.
We will do it again two nights from now,

989
01:39:19,800 --> 01:39:21,279
and you will see it then.

990
01:39:21,480 --> 01:39:23,789
- But I did see the ballet.
- You did?

991
01:39:24,000 --> 01:39:25,319
- Yes.
- How?

992
01:39:25,520 --> 01:39:28,876
- I thought you were...
- I was, but I could hear the music.

993
01:39:29,080 --> 01:39:31,355
I knew the story the music was telling.

994
01:39:31,560 --> 01:39:34,518
I didn't have to see you dance
with my eyes.

995
01:39:34,720 --> 01:39:37,109
Oh, Hans, how very dear you are,

996
01:39:37,320 --> 01:39:40,312
and how I love to dance it.

997
01:39:40,520 --> 01:39:43,239
I don't know quite why. It's very strange.

998
01:39:43,440 --> 01:39:47,274
Even when we rehearsed it,
I felt something sad and tender.

999
01:39:47,480 --> 01:39:51,234
- I don't know why.
- I know why.

1000
01:39:51,440 --> 01:39:52,873
You do? Tell me.

1001
01:39:54,280 --> 01:39:57,238
- I think it was your answer.
- My answer?

1002
01:39:57,440 --> 01:40:00,193
I let my heart speak to you
with the story, and...

1003
01:40:02,080 --> 01:40:05,595
...last night, you answered me with yours.

1004
01:40:06,480 --> 01:40:11,918
Hans, tell me something. How did you
come to write that story for me?

1005
01:40:12,840 --> 01:40:14,876
How else could I tell you how I felt?

1006
01:40:15,080 --> 01:40:17,833
That I knew how miserable
you were with him?

1007
01:40:18,040 --> 01:40:20,395
Miserable? With my husband?

1008
01:40:20,600 --> 01:40:25,276
Yes, I don't think you knew I was there,
but I saw the way he treated you.

1009
01:40:25,480 --> 01:40:27,436
I saw him slap you.

1010
01:40:28,520 --> 01:40:30,192
I heard you cry.

1011
01:40:32,280 --> 01:40:34,316
Oh, Hans...

1012
01:40:35,480 --> 01:40:40,110
- How else could a cobbler speak to you?
- It's arrived, my darling. It's here!

1013
01:40:40,320 --> 01:40:44,836
Good morning, Andersen. Your present,
angel. My apologies for last night.

1014
01:40:45,040 --> 01:40:48,919
You must forgive me. It was your ballet
I was thinking of, not you.

1015
01:40:49,120 --> 01:40:54,148
Did you tell him what a great success
it was? For a great lady of the ballet.

1016
01:40:56,640 --> 01:41:02,476
Open it! We shall be poor for the next
year, but I had to have it for you.

1017
01:41:02,680 --> 01:41:06,514
The best part's on the other side.
Turn it over and read it.

1018
01:41:06,720 --> 01:41:09,757
Read it aloud. I'm not a poet like you,
Andersen,

1019
01:41:09,960 --> 01:41:13,839
but once in a while,
even a fool like me can speak of love.

1020
01:41:14,040 --> 01:41:17,874
Are you pleased, my darling?
Read it for me.

1021
01:41:18,080 --> 01:41:20,036
Not now, Niels. Later.

1022
01:41:20,240 --> 01:41:24,518
You're not shy suddenly? Never mind.
You can do anything you wish.

1023
01:41:24,720 --> 01:41:28,315
She danced like an angel.
I could cover you with kisses.

1024
01:41:28,520 --> 01:41:30,670
Please don't, Niels.

1025
01:41:30,880 --> 01:41:33,792
Haven't you forgiven me?
Andersen has, I'm sure.

1026
01:41:34,000 --> 01:41:37,879
She was furious at me for locking you up,
but no harm has been done.

1027
01:41:38,080 --> 01:41:41,595
It's even rather amusing.
Don't you look so stern, my dear.

1028
01:41:41,800 --> 01:41:43,916
You were laughing about it yourself.

1029
01:41:44,120 --> 01:41:48,159
Don't tell me I didn't hear you laughing -
I did. Even under the covers.

1030
01:41:48,360 --> 01:41:51,796
- Be quiet.
- What's the matter with you, Doro?

1031
01:41:52,680 --> 01:41:56,673
Hans, it doesn't matter
why you wrote the story for me.

1032
01:41:56,880 --> 01:42:00,634
It's a beautiful story, whatever the reason.

1033
01:42:00,840 --> 01:42:03,638
It's a lovely and tender story by itself,

1034
01:42:03,840 --> 01:42:07,549
but I shall remember what you told me
every time I dance it.

1035
01:42:09,360 --> 01:42:12,875
- Andersen, we haven't paid you for it.
- Niels, do be quiet.

1036
01:42:13,080 --> 01:42:16,709
We want to pay him, don't we?
We'd like you to write more for us.

1037
01:42:16,920 --> 01:42:21,869
- Have you any other stories we can use?
- No. That one was just an accident.

1038
01:42:22,080 --> 01:42:24,674
I don't think I'll be writing any more.

1039
01:42:25,680 --> 01:42:28,240
I guess it's all right to deliver these now.

1040
01:42:28,440 --> 01:42:31,000
Some shoes from the cobbler.

1041
01:42:31,200 --> 01:42:33,350
Thank you, Hans.

1042
01:42:33,560 --> 01:42:38,714
- But, Andersen, I...
- Niels, let him go. Goodbye, Hans.

1043
01:42:47,240 --> 01:42:49,196
Doro...

1044
01:42:49,400 --> 01:42:52,472
Doro, what is it, my darling?

1045
01:43:29,560 --> 01:43:31,551
Peter!

1046
01:43:32,960 --> 01:43:36,236
Peter! Peter!

1047
01:43:36,440 --> 01:43:38,271
Peter!

1048
01:43:50,280 --> 01:43:52,236
Hello, Peter.

1049
01:43:56,880 --> 01:43:59,348
Do you mind if I walk along beside you?

1050
01:44:02,280 --> 01:44:04,236
I don't see how I can help it.

1051
01:44:04,440 --> 01:44:09,878
We both seem to be going in the same
direction, and there's only one road.

1052
01:44:13,480 --> 01:44:15,869
Are you going back to the village?

1053
01:44:20,040 --> 01:44:22,508
I'm going back to the village, too.

1054
01:44:24,680 --> 01:44:27,877
Bread and butter!
And you know something, Peter?

1055
01:44:29,120 --> 01:44:33,159
I'm never telling another story -
not even to myself.

1056
01:44:33,360 --> 01:44:35,316
I've told my last story, Peter.

1057
01:44:35,520 --> 01:44:37,476
Especially to myself.

1058
01:44:37,680 --> 01:44:40,240
Cobbler, stick to your last.

1059
01:44:40,440 --> 01:44:44,149
If any man ever learned his lesson
and learned it good, it's me.

1060
01:44:45,480 --> 01:44:48,472
- I think you'll go on telling stories.
- No, I won't.

1061
01:44:48,680 --> 01:44:50,352
- Yes, you will.
- No, I won't.

1062
01:44:50,560 --> 01:44:52,312
Why do you keep on saying that?

1063
01:44:52,520 --> 01:44:55,273
Why? Because
you're Hans Christian Andersen.

1064
01:44:56,400 --> 01:44:58,550
That's why!

1065
01:45:01,120 --> 01:45:03,076
Peter!

1066
01:45:05,560 --> 01:45:08,711
<i>You'll tell stories.
You'll write stories.</i>

1067
01:45:08,920 --> 01:45:11,195
You'll even sing stories.

1068
01:45:11,400 --> 01:45:14,517
Over and over and over again.

1069
01:45:18,440 --> 01:45:21,512
I'm not such an ugly duckling

1070
01:45:21,720 --> 01:45:24,359
No feathers all stubby and brown

1071
01:45:24,560 --> 01:45:27,552
For, in fact, these birds,
in so many words

1072
01:45:27,760 --> 01:45:30,320
Said, "Tsk! The best in town!

1073
01:45:30,520 --> 01:45:33,432
"Tsk! The best! Tsk! Tsk! The best!"

1074
01:45:33,640 --> 01:45:36,632
Remember your trip
to Copenhagen? Tell us about it!

1075
01:45:36,840 --> 01:45:41,994
Wonderful, wonderful Copenhagen

1076
01:45:42,200 --> 01:45:45,556
Friendly old girl of a town

1077
01:45:45,760 --> 01:45:47,432
'Neath her tavern light

1078
01:45:47,640 --> 01:45:54,239
On this merry night,
let us clink and drink one down

1079
01:45:54,440 --> 01:45:58,956
To wonderful, wonderful
Copenhagen...

1080
01:45:59,160 --> 01:46:02,436
<i>- Tell us about the king! The king!
- Yes, the king!</i>

1081
01:46:02,640 --> 01:46:06,269
The king is in the altogether,
but altogether, the altogether

1082
01:46:06,480 --> 01:46:09,358
He's altogether as naked
as the day that he was born

1083
01:46:09,560 --> 01:46:12,358
The king is in the altogether,
but altogether, the altogether

1084
01:46:12,560 --> 01:46:15,199
It's altogether the very least
the king has ever worn

1085
01:46:15,400 --> 01:46:18,278
<i>Call the court physician,
call an intermission...</i>

1086
01:46:18,480 --> 01:46:20,994
Hans! My favourite, huh?

1087
01:46:21,840 --> 01:46:23,558
<i>Thumbelina!</i>

1088
01:46:25,640 --> 01:46:28,279
Though you're no bigger
than my thumb

1089
01:46:28,480 --> 01:46:33,031
- Than my thumb
- Than my thumb

1090
01:46:33,240 --> 01:46:36,152
- Sweet Thumbelina, don't be glum
- Don't be glum

1091
01:46:36,360 --> 01:46:39,033
- Now, now, now
- Ah, ah, ah, come along

1092
01:46:39,240 --> 01:46:43,199
Everybody!
Thumbelina, Thumbelina, tiny little thing

1093
01:46:43,400 --> 01:46:46,710
Thumbelina dance, Thumbelina sing

1094
01:46:46,920 --> 01:46:50,799
Thumbelina, what's the difference
if you're very small?

1095
01:46:51,000 --> 01:46:58,270
When your heart is full of love,
you're nine feet tall!
