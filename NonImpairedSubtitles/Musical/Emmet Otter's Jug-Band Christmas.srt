00:07:32,434 --> 00:07:34,435
GOT TO EXPECT
COLD WEATHER,

162
00:07:34,436 --> 00:07:36,437
JUST A FEW DAYS
BEFORE CHRISTMAS.

163
00:07:36,438 --> 00:07:39,440
DON'T TALK ABOUT
CHRISTMAS ALL THE TIME.

164
00:07:39,441 --> 00:07:41,442
THERE'S NO POINT,
IS THERE?

165
00:07:41,443 --> 00:07:43,444
WE DON'T HAVE ENOUGH
FOR REGULAR DAYS.

166
00:07:43,445 --> 00:07:45,946
SORRY.

167
00:07:45,947 --> 00:07:48,949
I REMEMBER THE LAST
CHRISTMAS BEFORE PA DIED...

168
00:07:48,950 --> 00:07:49,950
OH, EMMET.

169
00:07:49,951 --> 00:07:53,153
I REMEMBER DECORATING
THE CHRISTMAS BRANCH AND...

170
00:07:53,154 --> 00:07:54,154
PA SANG AND...

171
00:07:54,155 --> 00:07:57,157
YOU PLAYED
THAT OL' PIANO WE HAD.

172
00:07:57,158 --> 00:07:59,159
I REMEMBER ALL RIGHT.

173
00:07:59,160 --> 00:08:00,661
SELLING THAT OLD PIANO

174
00:08:00,662 --> 00:08:02,663
WAS ONE OF THE SADDEST THINGS
I EVER HAD TO DO.

175
00:08:02,664 --> 00:08:05,165
SEEMS LIKE WE'VE SOLD
JUST ABOUT EVERYTHING

176
00:08:05,166 --> 00:08:06,667
LAST COUPLE OF YEARS.

177
00:08:06,668 --> 00:08:09,670
ABOUT ALL I'VE GOT LEFT IS
A SENSE OF HUMOR AND A WASHTUB.

178
00:08:09,671 --> 00:08:13,173
WELL, AT LEAST THERE AIN'T
NO HOLE IN THE WASHTUB.

179
00:08:13,174 --> 00:08:15,275
HEAD FULL OF GOOD THOUGHTS,
BELLY FULL OF GRUB,

180
00:08:15,276 --> 00:08:16,777
MONEY IN YOUR POCKET,

181
00:08:16,778 --> 00:08:21,778
WHEN THERE AIN'T
NO HOLE IN THE WASHTUB.

182
00:08:21,783 --> 00:08:26,286
SWEET AS HONEYSUCKLE
ON THE VINE, MA.

183
00:08:26,287 --> 00:08:28,288
Together:
YOUR NAILS WON'T BREAK
AND YOUR TOES WON'T STUB,

184
00:08:28,289 --> 00:08:29,790
YOU NEVER GET A FEVER

185
00:08:29,791 --> 00:08:34,791
WHEN THERE AIN'T
NO HOLE IN THE WASHTUB.

186
00:08:34,796 --> 00:08:36,797
IF YOU LOOK
TO THE GOOD SIDE,

187
00:08:36,798 --> 00:08:39,299
FALLING DOWN'S A FREE RIDE

188
00:08:39,300 --> 00:08:43,303
SLIPPING AND A-SLIDING
IN THE MUD.

189
00:08:43,304 --> 00:08:45,305
IF YOUR BACK IS HURTIN'

190
00:08:45,306 --> 00:08:47,307
I CAN SAY FOR CERTAIN

191
00:08:47,308 --> 00:08:52,308
I'LL BE THERE TO TREAT YOU
TO A SOOTHING BACK RUB.

192
00:08:54,315 --> 00:08:59,315
Emmet:
WHEN THERE AIN'T
NO HOLE IN THE WASHTUB.

193

199
00:09:15,336 --> 00:09:20,336
WHEN THERE AIN'T
NO HOLE IN THE WASHTUB.

200
00:09:21,342 --> 00:09:22,342
HI, EMMET.

201
00:09:22,343 --> 00:09:24,344

00:09:32,353 --> 00:09:37,353
I'LL BE THERE TO TREAT YOU

206
00:09:38,860 --> 00:09:43,860
WHEN THERE AIN'T
NO HOLE IN THE WASHTUB.

207
00:09:44,366 --> 00:09:47,868
THERE GO TWO OF THE NICEST FOLK
ON THE RIVER.

208
00:09:47,869 --> 00:09:49,870
IF YOU LOOK
TO THE GOOD SIDE,

209
00:09:49,871 --> 00:09:52,372
FALLING DOWN'S A FREE RIDE

210

SLIPPING AND A-SLIDING
IN THE MUD.

211
00:09:55,877 --> 00:09:57,878
THOUGH IT TWISTS
AND CONTORTS YOU,

212
00:09:57,879 --> 00:10:00,380
THAT BARREL SUPPORTS YOU.

213
00:10:00,381 --> 00:10:02,382
YOU CAN FEED
AND CLOTHE YOURSELF

AIN'T NO HOLE
IN THE WASHTUB.

218
00:10:27,909 --> 00:10:32,909
( Music )

219
00:10:37,619 --> 00:10:42,619
( Music Continues )

220
00:10:47,629 --> 00:10:52,629
PHEW! BOY,

AWWWWW.

321
00:14:11,532 --> 00:14:12,032
CO

322
00:14:12,033 --> 00:14:13,734
ME ON,
WHY NOT, EMMET?

323
00:14:13,735 --> 00:14:16,837
BECAUSE, TO MAKE
A WASHTUB BASS,

324
00:14:16,838 --> 00:14:21,541
YOU HAVE TO PUT
A HOLE IN THE WASHTUB!!

325
00:14:21,542 --> 00:14:24,544
HMM...I DON'T EVEN HAVE
A PROPER COSTUME.

326
00:14:24,545 --> 00:14:28,548
HETTY, I CAN'T POSSIBLY
ENTER THAT CONTEST!

327
00:14:28,549 --> 00:14:30,550
YOU'RE RIGHT, ALICE.

328
00:14:30,551 --> 00:14:33,053
FORGET THE WHOLE THING.

329
00:14:33,054 --> 00:14:38,054
HETTY MUSKRAT, YOU STOP TRYING
TO SWEET-TALK ME INTO THIS!

330
00:14:40,561 --> 00:14:43,563
THIS IS THE FENCE
WE'RE SUPPOSED TO MEND?

331
00:14:43,564 --> 00:14:45,565
WELL...

332
00:14:45,566 --> 00:14:46,566
YEAH.

333
00:14:46,567 --> 00:14:49,069
THAT'S NOT REPAIRING,
THAT'S REBUILDING.

334
00:14:49,070 --> 00:14:52,072
DON'T JUST
STAND AROUND, BOYS.

335
00:14:52,073 --> 00:14:57,073
YA GOT WORK TO DO.

336
00:14:58,079 --> 00:15:03,079
( Banjo )

337
00:15:04,585 --> 00:15:06,586
( Thinking )
JUST ONCE I'D LIKE TO GIVE

338
00:15:06,587 --> 00:15:10,590
A FINE STORE-BOUGHT PRESENT
TO EMMET FOR CHRISTMAS.

339
00:15:10,591 --> 00:15:14,594
AND WITH $50...

340
00:15:14,595 --> 00:15:17,097
( Tap! Tap! Tap... )

341
00:15:17,098 --> 00:15:19,599
( Thinking )
I'VE NEVER GIVEN MA
A NICE CHRISTMAS PRESENT.

342
00:15:19,600 --> 00:15:21,101
NEVER GAVE ONE TO PA, EITHER...

343
00:15:21,102 --> 00:15:25,105
AND...NOW IT'S TOO LATE.

344
00:15:25,106 --> 00:15:30,106
HARVEY SAYS $50
SPLIT FOUR WAYS IS $12.50.

345
00:15:30,611 --> 00:15:35,115
LOTTA MONEY.

346
00:15:35,116 --> 00:15:37,617
THAT GUITAR WE SAW IN TOWN...

347
00:15:37,618 --> 00:15:41,121
THE ONE WITH
THE MOTHER-OF-PEARL INLAYS...

348
00:15:41,122 --> 00:15:45,125
EMMET REALLYWANTS IT.

349
00:15:45,126 --> 00:15:48,628
BUT...$40!

350
00:15:48,629 --> 00:15:52,632
I CAN'T BUY A PIANO
FOR $12.50 ANYWAY...

351
00:15:52,633 --> 00:15:57,633
BUT YOU COULDPUT
A DOWN PAYMENT ON A USED ONE.

352
00:15:59,640 --> 00:16:02,642
BUT IF I DO ENTER,
I GOTTA HAVE A COSTUME.

353
00:16:02,643 --> 00:16:06,646
AND TO BUY A COSTUME,
I'D HAVE TO HOCK SOMETHING.

354
00:16:06,647 --> 00:16:07,647
HMM...

355
00:16:07,648 --> 00:16:10,150
NOTHING LEFT TO HOCK.

356
00:16:10,151 --> 00:16:14,154
OF COURSE, THERE'S
PA'S OLD TOOL CHEST.

357
00:16:14,155 --> 00:16:17,657
BUT EMMET USES THAT
FOR ODD JOBS!

358
00:16:17,658 --> 00:16:19,659
WE WOULDMAKE
A GOOD JUG-BAND...

359
00:16:19,660 --> 00:16:24,660
BUT TO PUT A HOLE
IN MA'S WASHTUB...

360
00:16:26,667 --> 00:16:31,667
HE SURE WOULD
LIKE THAT GUITAR.

361
00:16:32,673 --> 00:16:35,175
NOTHIN' WOULD MAKE HER HAPPIER

362
00:16:35,176 --> 00:16:39,179
THAN HAVING
A GOOD OL' PIANO AGAIN.

363
00:16:39,180 --> 00:16:44,180
I JUST DON'T KNOW...

364
00:16:47,188 --> 00:16:52,188
( Sigh! )
I JUST CAN'T DECIDE...

365
00:16:56,697 --> 00:16:58,698
MA...

366
00:16:58,699 --> 00:17:00,200
I'M HOME!

367
00:17:00,201 --> 00:17:01,701
I CUT THE CHRISTMAS BRANCH.

368
00:17:01,702 --> 00:17:03,203
OH, I SEE YOU DID.

369
00:17:03,204 --> 00:17:05,705
WELL, AFTER ALL,
TOMORROW'S CHRISTMAS EVE

370
00:17:05,706 --> 00:17:07,707
AND EVEN IF WE
DON'T HAVE PRESENTS,

371
00:17:07,708 --> 00:17:09,209
AT LEAST WE CAN
HAVE THE BRANCH.

372
00:17:09,210 --> 00:17:12,212
IT'S A NICE ONE, EMMET.

373
00:17:12,213 --> 00:17:14,714
JUST LIKE
PA USED TO BRING HOME.

374
00:17:14,715 --> 00:17:15,215
YUP.

375
00:17:15,216 --> 00:17:16,716
EVERY YEAR HE'D GO OUT VOWING

376
00:17:16,717 --> 00:17:20,720
HE WAS GOING TO BRING HOME
AREALWHOLE CHRISTMAS TREE.

377
00:17:20,721 --> 00:17:22,722
HA! BUT HE NEVER HAD
THE HEART TO DO IT.

378
00:17:22,723 --> 00:17:24,524
AND EVERY YEAR HE'D SAY...

379
00:17:24,525 --> 00:17:27,527
( Big, Deep Voice )
"BECAUSE I DIDN'T CUT IT DOWN,"

380
00:17:27,528 --> 00:17:32,528
"THE REST OF THAT TREE WILL
STILL BE ALIVE IN 100 YEARS."

381
00:17:32,533 --> 00:17:36,036
( Laughing )
YOU KNOW, SOMETIMES
YOU EVEN SOUND LIKE YOUR PA!

382
00:17:36,037 --> 00:17:41,037
MA, DO YOU SUPPOSE IT'D BE
SAFE TO USE PA'S SLIDE NOW?

383
00:17:41,042 --> 00:17:43,043
OH, I SHOULD
THINK SO!

384
00:17:43,044 --> 00:17:46,046
THE ICE MUST BE SOLID
BY THIS TIME.

385
00:17:46,047 --> 00:17:47,547
RACE YA TO HER!

386
00:17:47,548 --> 00:17:50,050
HEY, WAIT FOR ME NOW...

387
00:17:50,051 --> 00:17:52,052
FIRST SLIDE OF THE YEAR...

388
00:17:52,053 --> 00:17:53,353
WHOOPEE!

389
00:17:53,354 --> 00:17:55,655
( Laughing )

390
00:17:55,656 --> 00:17:56,156
WOW!

391
00:17:56,157 --> 00:17:56,656
I FORGOT

392
00:17:56,657 --> 00:17:58,158
HOW MUCH FUN
THAT IS!

393
00:17:58,159 --> 00:18:00,660
( Laughing )
WELL, STAND BACK!

394
00:18:00,661 --> 00:18:02,762
IT'S MY TURN!

395
00:18:02,763 --> 00:18:04,864
WHOOOO!

396
00:18:04,865 --> 00:18:06,766
( Laughing )

397
00:18:06,767 --> 00:18:07,767
WOW, WASN'T
THAT GREAT?

398
00:18:07,768 --> 00:18:09,769
IT'S GOOD ENOUGH.

399
00:18:09,770 --> 00:18:11,371
GOOD ENOUGH
FOR WHAT?

400
00:18:11,372 --> 00:18:12,872
GOOD ENOUGH
TO DO AGAIN!

401
00:18:12,873 --> 00:18:14,574
( Laughing )

402
00:18:14,575 --> 00:18:16,076
HEY, NOW,
MY TURN NEXT!

403
00:18:16,077 --> 00:18:18,078
( Laughing )

404
00:18:18,079 --> 00:18:21,081
WATCH, EMMET,
IT'S MY TURN AGAIN.

405
00:18:21,082 --> 00:18:22,682
( Laughing )

406
00:18:22,683 --> 00:18:24,084

OH, WATCH
THIS ONE, MA.

THAT OLD SLIDE'S JUST ABOUT
THE BEST THING PA EVER BUILT.

414
00:18:42,703 --> 00:18:45,705
YEAH, HE MAY NOT
HAVE LEFT US MUCH,

415
00:18:45,706 --> 00:18:48,208
BUT THAT OLD SLIDE
IS JUST ABOUT ENOUGH.

416
00:18:48,209 --> 00:18:51,211
GEE, I THINK
HE LEFT US A LOT.

417
00:18:51,212 --> 00:18:55,215
WELL, HE LEFT
WHAT HE COULD.

418
00:18:55,216 --> 00:18:56,716

419
00:18:56,717 --> 00:18:58,718

TO TAKE SOME CHANCES

"OR LIFE WILL NEVER
COME TO NOTHIN'."

ON SNAKE OIL.

422

FACT THAT IT DIDN'T
COME TO MUCH HARDLY MATTERS.

423

THAT TOOL CHEST.

IN THAT WASHTUB.

WILL FIND A PURPOSE

MEETS THE SEA,

WHEN YOU MEET SOMEBODY
THAT DON'T LIKE SOUL FOOD

463
00:23:38,799 --> 00:23:40,800
THEY'VE STILL GOT A SOUL.

464
00:23:40,801 --> 00:23:43,303
AND IT DON'T MEAN THAT
YOU'VE GOT NO RHYTHM

IF YOU DON'T LIKE
ROCK AND ROLL.

LIKE MINE,
