00:01:34,087 --> 00:01:36,521
<i>- Opening night
- Opening night</i>

2
00:01:36,687 --> 00:01:40,077
<i>It's opening night</i>

3
00:01:42,567 --> 00:01:45,843
<i>It's Max Bialystock's latest show</i>

4
00:01:46,007 --> 00:01:48,726
<i>Will it flop or will it go?</i>

5
00:01:48,887 --> 00:01:51,765
<i>The cast is taking its final bow</i>

6
00:01:51,927 --> 00:01:54,646
<i>Here comes the audience now</i>

7
00:01:54,807 --> 00:01:57,367
<i>The doors are open
They're on their way</i>

8
00:01:57,527 --> 00:02:01,805
<i>Let's hear what they have to say</i>

9
00:02:03,447 --> 00:02:06,644
<i>He's done it again
He's done it again</i>

10
00:02:06,807 --> 00:02:09,526
<i>Max Bialystock has done it again</i>

11
00:02:09,687 --> 00:02:12,485
<i>We can't believe it</i>

12
00:02:12,647 --> 00:02:15,445
<i>You can't conceive it</i>

13
00:02:15,607 --> 00:02:18,075
<i>How'd he achieve it?</i>

14
00:02:18,247 --> 00:02:21,557
<i>It's the worst show in town</i>

15
00:02:21,727 --> 00:02:24,400
<i>We sat there sighing</i>

16
00:02:24,567 --> 00:02:27,365
<i>Groaning and crying</i>

17
00:02:27,527 --> 00:02:29,882
<i>There's no denying</i>

18
00:02:30,047 --> 00:02:33,039
<i>It's the worst show in town</i>

19
00:02:33,207 --> 00:02:36,119
<i>Oh, we wanted to stand up and hiss</i>

20
00:02:36,287 --> 00:02:40,917
<i>We've seen shit
But never like this</i>

21
00:02:41,327 --> 00:02:44,205
<i>Max Bialystock has done it again</i>

22
00:02:47,247 --> 00:02:50,159
<i>The songs were rotten
The book was stinkin'</i>

23
00:02:50,327 --> 00:02:53,603
<i>What he did to Shak espeare
Booth did to Lincoln</i>

24
00:02:53,767 --> 00:02:56,600
We had this specially made up
for Max Bialystock.

25
00:02:59,127 --> 00:03:03,166
<i>We couldn't leave faster</i>

26
00:03:05,367 --> 00:03:08,359
<i>What a disaster</i>

27
00:03:08,527 --> 00:03:11,200
<i>We are still in shock</i>

28
00:03:11,367 --> 00:03:13,801
<i>Who produced this schlock?</i>

29
00:03:13,967 --> 00:03:18,802
<i>That slimy, sleazy Max Bialystock</i>

30
00:03:19,407 --> 00:03:20,965
<i>What a bum</i>

31
00:03:31,807 --> 00:03:33,399
Hello?

32
00:03:35,647 --> 00:03:37,842
Mr. Bialystock?

33
00:03:45,487 --> 00:03:47,682
Anybody here?

34
00:03:48,407 --> 00:03:49,681
Mr. Bialystock?

35
00:03:51,447 --> 00:03:53,915
Who are you?
What are you doing here?

36
00:03:54,087 --> 00:03:56,157
What do you want?

37
00:03:56,327 --> 00:03:58,636
Speak to me, dummy. Speak!

38
00:03:59,247 --> 00:04:01,238
Why don't you speak?

39
00:04:01,407 --> 00:04:03,523
Scared. Can't talk.

40
00:04:05,367 --> 00:04:06,880
All right, I'm sorry.

41
00:04:07,047 --> 00:04:09,800
I'm sorry. Calm down. Get ahold
of yourself. Come with me.

42
00:04:09,967 --> 00:04:12,561
Come on. Come on.

43
00:04:12,727 --> 00:04:15,764
Come on, right this way.
Watch your step.

44
00:04:16,887 --> 00:04:18,843
Look, just...

45
00:04:19,007 --> 00:04:21,202
Take a deep breath.

46
00:04:21,367 --> 00:04:23,437
Let it out slowly.

47
00:04:26,927 --> 00:04:29,157
- Who are you?
- I am Leopold Bloom.

48
00:04:29,327 --> 00:04:31,716
I'm an accountant.
I'm from Whitehall & Marks...

49
00:04:31,887 --> 00:04:35,038
...and I've come to do your books.
- Oh, you have, huh? Well, listen...

50
00:04:35,207 --> 00:04:38,119
- Who is it?
- Hold Me- Touch Me.

51
00:04:38,287 --> 00:04:41,199
Hold Me- Touch Me.
One of my backers.

52
00:04:41,367 --> 00:04:44,279
Listen, I have to meet
with an important investor.

53
00:04:44,447 --> 00:04:46,642
Do me a big favour,
go to the bathroom.

54
00:04:46,807 --> 00:04:51,437
- But I don't have to go.
- Try. Try. Think of Niagara Falls.

55
00:04:53,367 --> 00:04:56,916
Be with you in a moment,
my darling.

56
00:04:59,887 --> 00:05:03,357
Hold Me- Touch Me.
Where is Hold Me- Touch Me?

57
00:05:03,527 --> 00:05:05,119
Kiss Me- Feel Me,
Clinch Me- Pinch Me...

58
00:05:05,287 --> 00:05:06,515
...Lick Me- Bite Me, Suck Me...

59
00:05:06,687 --> 00:05:08,518
Here she is. Hold Me- Touch Me.

60
00:05:08,687 --> 00:05:11,599
You know, it worked.
As soon as I pictured Niagara Falls...

61
00:05:11,767 --> 00:05:16,318
...I didn't have any trouble at all...
- Back. Back. Don't make a sound.

62
00:05:19,447 --> 00:05:22,325
Coming. Coming.

63
00:05:40,247 --> 00:05:42,715
Hello, gorgeous.

64
00:05:42,887 --> 00:05:47,085
- Hold me, touch me.
- As soon as I shut the door.

65
00:05:51,607 --> 00:05:53,165
Did you bring the checkie?

66
00:05:53,327 --> 00:05:57,115
Bialy can't produce plays
without checkies.

67
00:05:57,287 --> 00:05:59,596
Here you go.

68
00:06:01,567 --> 00:06:04,718
But first,
can we please play a game?

69
00:06:04,887 --> 00:06:07,685
One dirty little game.

70
00:06:07,847 --> 00:06:11,920
All right, my little sex kitten.

71
00:06:12,087 --> 00:06:13,725
What shall we play?

72
00:06:13,887 --> 00:06:15,798
The Debutante and the Bricklayer?

73
00:06:15,967 --> 00:06:17,685
- Oh, no.
- No.

74
00:06:17,847 --> 00:06:20,202
How about the Rabbi
and the Contortionist?

75
00:06:20,367 --> 00:06:23,279
You like that one, mama,
keeps you limber.

76
00:06:23,447 --> 00:06:24,675
I know.

77
00:06:24,847 --> 00:06:30,001
Let's play the Virgin Milkmaid
and the Well-Hung Stableboy.

78
00:06:33,047 --> 00:06:35,163
I don't think I have the strength.

79
00:06:35,327 --> 00:06:39,400
- Don't worry, I'll be gentle.
- All right.

80
00:06:42,407 --> 00:06:44,477
Oh, dear...

81
00:06:44,647 --> 00:06:50,802
...this milk is so heavy.
I'll never reach the house.

82
00:06:50,967 --> 00:06:54,482
You there, well-hung stableboy.

83
00:06:55,447 --> 00:06:59,042
Won't you please help me?

84
00:07:01,367 --> 00:07:04,040
Of course, my little dairy queen.

85
00:07:04,207 --> 00:07:07,677
First I'll take your milk.

86
00:07:07,847 --> 00:07:11,044
Then I shall take your virginity!

87
00:07:11,447 --> 00:07:14,962
No! No! Never! Never!

88
00:07:15,127 --> 00:07:17,880
Yes. Yes.

89
00:07:18,047 --> 00:07:20,561
Give it to me, well-hung!
Give it to me.

90
00:07:20,727 --> 00:07:23,287
Darling, wait,
I haven't even had coffee yet.

91
00:07:23,447 --> 00:07:26,086
- Take it easy. Take it easy.
- Oh, my God.

92
00:07:26,247 --> 00:07:30,126
Send me to the moon, you animal.
Send me to the moon.

93
00:07:30,287 --> 00:07:34,485
Yes. Yes, my darling.
Thursday. Come back Thursday.

94
00:07:34,647 --> 00:07:38,799
I'll send you to the moon Thursday.
I may even join you.

95
00:07:38,967 --> 00:07:41,037
But first, the checkie.

96
00:07:41,207 --> 00:07:44,961
Where's the checkie?
Come on, come on, find the checkie.

97
00:07:45,807 --> 00:07:48,321
Here you go.

98
00:07:49,687 --> 00:07:54,886
I made it out, like you told me,
to the title of the play:

99
00:07:55,047 --> 00:07:56,526
<i>- Cash.
- Yes.</i>

100
00:07:56,687 --> 00:07:59,406
<i>That's a funny name
for a play, Cash.</i>

101
00:07:59,567 --> 00:08:02,240
<i>Yes, so was The Iceman Cometh.</i>

102
00:08:02,407 --> 00:08:04,079
I'll see you Thursday.

103
00:08:06,247 --> 00:08:08,158
- Bye.
- Bye. Bye.

104
00:08:08,327 --> 00:08:11,205
Yes, yes, yes.

105
00:08:16,167 --> 00:08:18,886
You dirty old buzzard.

106
00:08:19,487 --> 00:08:22,081
May I come out of the bathroom now,
Mr. Bialystock?

107
00:08:23,167 --> 00:08:24,885
- Yeah, sure.
- I'm terribly sorry I caught you...

108
00:08:25,047 --> 00:08:28,722
...feeling up the old lady.
- " Feeling up the old lady. "

109
00:08:28,887 --> 00:08:30,843
Thank you, Mr. Tact.

110
00:08:31,007 --> 00:08:33,999
- May I take your coat?
- Oh, thank you.

111
00:08:34,167 --> 00:08:35,998
So you're an accountant, huh?

112
00:08:36,207 --> 00:08:38,482
- Yes, sir. I am, sir.
- Then account for yourself!

113
00:08:38,647 --> 00:08:41,605
<i>Why are you looking up little
old ladies' dresses? Bit of a pervert?</i>

114
00:08:41,807 --> 00:08:43,399
I know what you're thinking.

115
00:08:43,567 --> 00:08:46,161
How dare you condemn me
without knowing all the facts.

116
00:08:46,327 --> 00:08:48,636
- Mr. Bialystock, I wasn't condemn...
- Shut up!

117
00:08:48,807 --> 00:08:51,241
I'm having a rhetorical conversation.

118
00:08:51,407 --> 00:08:55,400
- Do you know who I used to be?
- Well, yes. You're Max Bialystock...

119
00:08:55,567 --> 00:08:59,799
...the king of Broadway.
- No, I'm Max Bialy... That's right.

120
00:08:59,967 --> 00:09:02,879
- That's right.
- And might I say, Mr. Bialystock...

121
00:09:03,047 --> 00:09:05,436
And please don't take this
the wrong way...

122
00:09:05,607 --> 00:09:08,201
...but you're not just a dirty old man.
- Thank you.

123
00:09:08,367 --> 00:09:11,404
Oh, you're also
a great Broadway producer.

124
00:09:11,567 --> 00:09:14,320
And there's something about me
you should know.

125
00:09:14,487 --> 00:09:15,966
When I was a kid...

126
00:09:16,127 --> 00:09:19,961
<i>...I had the good fortune
to be taken to Bialy-Hoos of '42.</i>

127
00:09:20,127 --> 00:09:22,083
<i>- Oh, Bialy-Hoos.
- Yes.</i>

128
00:09:22,247 --> 00:09:25,045
And I still have the ticket stub.

129
00:09:25,207 --> 00:09:27,084
- Oh, look at that.
- Yeah.

130
00:09:27,247 --> 00:09:30,239
And ever since,
I've had a secret desire...

131
00:09:30,407 --> 00:09:33,205
...to be a Broadway producer.

132
00:09:33,367 --> 00:09:35,722
A secret desire, huh?

133
00:09:35,887 --> 00:09:39,118
- Kid, can I give you some advice?
- Yes, sir.

134
00:09:39,287 --> 00:09:41,642
Keep it a secret.
Do the books, please.

135
00:09:41,807 --> 00:09:43,843
Top drawer, to the left.

136
00:09:51,047 --> 00:09:52,639
Oh, my God.

137
00:09:53,247 --> 00:09:54,600
Will you look at that.

138
00:09:54,767 --> 00:09:59,636
That's it, baby!
When you got it, flaunt it! Flaunt it!

139
00:10:01,047 --> 00:10:03,845
Mr. Bialystock,
may I speak to you a minute?

140
00:10:04,407 --> 00:10:05,886
- A minute?
- Yes.

141
00:10:06,047 --> 00:10:07,275
- Just one minute?
- Yes.

142
00:10:07,447 --> 00:10:09,438
- Okay.
- In glancing at your books...

143
00:10:09,607 --> 00:10:12,838
- Go! You have 58 seconds left.
... I noticed that in the column...

144
00:10:13,007 --> 00:10:15,237
- You're gonna time it?
- Time is money.

145
00:10:15,407 --> 00:10:18,479
I looked at your books and the
columns marked "monies received. "

146
00:10:18,647 --> 00:10:21,525
- And I can't make the figures work out.
- Forty-eight seconds. Hurry.

147
00:10:21,687 --> 00:10:25,157
- There's a problem with your figures.
- Twenty-eight. Running out of time.

148
00:10:25,327 --> 00:10:27,602
- Tick, tock. Tick, tock. Tick, tock.
- I cannot...

149
00:10:27,767 --> 00:10:29,758
- Fifteen seconds.
- I cannot... I can't function.

150
00:10:29,927 --> 00:10:33,078
- I cannot function in these conditions.
- Five, four, three, two, one.

151
00:10:33,247 --> 00:10:36,444
You're making me
extremely nervous.

152
00:10:37,367 --> 00:10:38,959
What is that, a handkerchief?

153
00:10:39,127 --> 00:10:41,880
What? This? No, it's nothing.
It's nothing.

154
00:10:42,047 --> 00:10:46,165
Well, if it's nothing,
then why can't I see it?

155
00:10:46,807 --> 00:10:50,641
My blanket. My blue blanket!

156
00:10:50,807 --> 00:10:53,241
Give me back my blue blanket!

157
00:10:53,927 --> 00:10:59,047
Give me my blanket! Give it to me.
Give it to me. Give me the blanket.

158
00:11:00,887 --> 00:11:02,798
Give it to me! Give it to me!

159
00:11:02,967 --> 00:11:05,003
Here, here, here.

160
00:11:05,167 --> 00:11:08,364
Don't panic. Don't panic.
Don't panic.

161
00:11:08,527 --> 00:11:10,438
I...

162
00:11:10,607 --> 00:11:11,801
I'm sorry.

163
00:11:11,967 --> 00:11:14,720
It's just that I don't like anyone
touching my blue blanket.

164
00:11:14,887 --> 00:11:18,004
It's not important,
it's a minor compulsion.

165
00:11:18,167 --> 00:11:19,964
I can deal with it if I want to.

166
00:11:20,127 --> 00:11:24,643
But I've had it ever since I was a baby,
and I find it very comforting.

167
00:11:26,407 --> 00:11:29,046
I need to lie down for a minute now.

168
00:11:33,327 --> 00:11:35,602
They come here. They all come here.

169
00:11:35,767 --> 00:11:39,123
How do they find me?

170
00:11:39,487 --> 00:11:41,955
Hey, kid. Hey.

171
00:11:43,407 --> 00:11:45,875
Look at this.

172
00:11:46,047 --> 00:11:47,446
How can I help you?

173
00:11:47,607 --> 00:11:49,962
- What's wrong?
- You're gonna jump on me.

174
00:11:50,127 --> 00:11:51,879
- What?
- You're gonna jump on me.

175
00:11:52,047 --> 00:11:55,756
I know you're gonna jump on me
and squash me like a bug.

176
00:11:55,927 --> 00:11:57,804
- Oh, God.
- Please, don't jump on me!

177
00:11:57,967 --> 00:12:00,527
I'm not gonna jump on you!
I'm not gonna jump on you!

178
00:12:00,687 --> 00:12:03,247
Get ahold of yourself!
Stop it! Stop it!

179
00:12:03,407 --> 00:12:05,363
Stop! Calm down!

180
00:12:05,527 --> 00:12:07,643
Don't touch me! Don't touch me.

181
00:12:07,807 --> 00:12:10,844
- What's the matter now?
- I'm hysterical. I'm having hysterics.

182
00:12:11,007 --> 00:12:15,159
I can't stop when I get like this.
I can't stop. I'm hysterical.

183
00:12:15,647 --> 00:12:18,798
I can see that.
All right. All right, calm down.

184
00:12:18,967 --> 00:12:21,276
I'm coming, I'm coming.
Take it easy.

185
00:12:30,967 --> 00:12:32,320
I'm wet!

186
00:12:32,487 --> 00:12:35,126
I'm wet.
I'm hysterical and I'm wet!

187
00:12:37,687 --> 00:12:39,439
I'm in pain.

188
00:12:39,607 --> 00:12:41,484
I'm in pain, I'm wet...

189
00:12:41,647 --> 00:12:44,161
...and I'm still hysterical.

190
00:12:45,007 --> 00:12:48,636
All right, all right. What can I do?
You're getting me hysterical.

191
00:12:48,807 --> 00:12:50,001
Move away, you frighten me.

192
00:12:50,167 --> 00:12:51,441
- You're too close.
- I frighten you?

193
00:12:51,607 --> 00:12:55,122
Yes, get over there and stop
touching... Move over there! Sit down.

194
00:12:55,287 --> 00:12:57,482
I'm sitting, I'm sitting.

195
00:12:57,647 --> 00:12:59,205
You still look angry.

196
00:12:59,367 --> 00:13:02,165
I'm sorry. How's this?

197
00:13:07,407 --> 00:13:10,046
Who's my little accountant?

198
00:13:10,647 --> 00:13:13,161
Who's my little accountant?

199
00:13:13,327 --> 00:13:17,036
Are you my little accountant?
Are you my little accountant?

200
00:13:17,207 --> 00:13:18,959
- Are you my little accountant?
- I am.

201
00:13:19,127 --> 00:13:21,083
Yes, you are.

202
00:13:22,447 --> 00:13:25,678
Well, thank you for smiling.
That helped a great deal.

203
00:13:25,847 --> 00:13:27,360
Well, you know what they say:

204
00:13:27,527 --> 00:13:30,564
"Smile and the world smiles
with you. "

205
00:13:31,207 --> 00:13:33,846
This man should be
in a straightjacket.

206
00:13:34,007 --> 00:13:36,726
- You feeling better?
- Oh, yes, I'm fine now. Thank you.

207
00:13:36,887 --> 00:13:39,276
- Good.
- May I speak to you?

208
00:13:39,447 --> 00:13:41,597
Yes, Prince Myshkin.
What can we do for you?

209
00:13:41,767 --> 00:13:45,043
Well, this is hardly
the time for levity, Mr. Bialystock.

210
00:13:45,207 --> 00:13:47,084
I've discovered a serious error...

211
00:13:47,247 --> 00:13:49,886
<i>...in the accounts of your last show,
Funny Boy.</i>

212
00:13:50,047 --> 00:13:52,720
- Where? What?
- Well, according to the backers list...

213
00:13:52,887 --> 00:13:57,915
...you raised $100,000.
But your show only cost 98,000.

214
00:13:58,087 --> 00:13:59,805
There's 2000 unaccounted for.

215
00:13:59,967 --> 00:14:02,356
I went to a Turkish bath.
Who cares?

216
00:14:02,527 --> 00:14:04,722
The show was a flop.
Bloom, do me a favour...

217
00:14:04,887 --> 00:14:08,277
...move a few decimal points around.
You can do it, you're an accountant.

218
00:14:08,447 --> 00:14:12,235
You're part of a noble profession.
The word "count" is part of your title.

219
00:14:12,407 --> 00:14:15,126
- That's cheating.
- It's not cheating.

220
00:14:15,287 --> 00:14:16,925
It's charity.

221
00:14:17,087 --> 00:14:19,078
Bloom...

222
00:14:19,247 --> 00:14:20,726
...you see this stickpin?

223
00:14:20,887 --> 00:14:23,242
This once held a pearl
as big as your eye.

224
00:14:23,407 --> 00:14:28,481
I used to wear handmade
Italian shoes, $500 suits.

225
00:14:28,647 --> 00:14:29,682
And look at me now.

226
00:14:29,847 --> 00:14:34,045
Look at me now!
I'm wearing a cardboard belt.

227
00:14:38,487 --> 00:14:41,160
Bloom, you gotta save me.

228
00:14:41,327 --> 00:14:42,555
I'm reaching out to you.

229
00:14:42,727 --> 00:14:45,366
Don't send me to prison.

230
00:14:45,527 --> 00:14:49,076
Help me.

231
00:14:53,327 --> 00:14:56,125
All right. All right.
Okay, I'll do it.

232
00:14:56,287 --> 00:14:57,686
- Really?
- Yes, I'll do it.

233
00:14:57,847 --> 00:15:00,486
See, $2000 isn't so much.

234
00:15:00,647 --> 00:15:02,524
I'm sure I can hide it someplace.

235
00:15:02,687 --> 00:15:06,077
After all, the IRS isn't interested
in a show that flopped.

236
00:15:06,247 --> 00:15:08,238
Right. Good thinking.

237
00:15:08,407 --> 00:15:11,922
You figure it out.
I'm gonna take a little nap.

238
00:15:12,527 --> 00:15:13,801
Now, let's see.

239
00:15:13,967 --> 00:15:17,118
Let's see, if we add up
these deductions, we get...

240
00:15:17,287 --> 00:15:19,755
Carry the three, divide by four...

241
00:15:21,607 --> 00:15:24,075
Amazing.

242
00:15:24,247 --> 00:15:26,636
It's absolutely amazing, but...

243
00:15:26,807 --> 00:15:28,320
...under the right circumstances...

244
00:15:28,487 --> 00:15:30,955
...a producer could
make more money with a flop...

245
00:15:31,127 --> 00:15:33,118
...than he could with a hit.

246
00:15:33,287 --> 00:15:36,643
Yes, it's quite possible. If he were
certain that a show would fail...

247
00:15:36,807 --> 00:15:39,116
...a man could make a fortune.

248
00:15:39,287 --> 00:15:41,118
- Yes?
- Yes, what?

249
00:15:41,287 --> 00:15:44,006
- What you were saying. Keep talking.
- What was I saying?

250
00:15:44,167 --> 00:15:45,646
You were saying that a producer...

251
00:15:45,807 --> 00:15:48,082
...could make more money
with a flop than a hit.

252
00:15:48,247 --> 00:15:49,839
Well, yes. It's quite possible.

253
00:15:50,007 --> 00:15:52,123
You keep saying that,
but you don't say how.

254
00:15:52,287 --> 00:15:56,041
Well, it's simply a matter
of creative accounting.

255
00:15:56,207 --> 00:15:59,597
Let's assume for a moment
that you are a dishonest man.

256
00:15:59,767 --> 00:16:00,961
Assume away.

257
00:16:01,127 --> 00:16:04,358
<i>All right. When you produced
your last show, Funny Boy...</i>

258
00:16:04,527 --> 00:16:07,200
...you raised $2000
more than you needed.

259
00:16:07,367 --> 00:16:09,119
But you could've raised a million...

260
00:16:09,287 --> 00:16:11,926
...put on your $100,000 flop
and kept the rest.

261
00:16:12,087 --> 00:16:14,965
- But what if my show was a hit?
- Then you would go to jail.

262
00:16:15,127 --> 00:16:17,197
See, rather than 100 percent
of the show...

263
00:16:17,367 --> 00:16:19,483
...you would've sold
more than 1000 percent.

264
00:16:19,647 --> 00:16:23,083
So if the show's a success,
there's no way to pay off the backers.

265
00:16:23,247 --> 00:16:24,726
- Get it?
- Got it.

266
00:16:24,887 --> 00:16:28,004
So in order for our scheme to work,
we'd have to find a sure- fire flop.

267
00:16:28,167 --> 00:16:29,919
<i>"Our scheme"? What scheme?</i>

268
00:16:30,687 --> 00:16:31,961
What scheme?

269
00:16:32,127 --> 00:16:34,925
Your scheme,
you bloody little genius.

270
00:16:35,087 --> 00:16:38,477
I meant no scheme. I merely posed
a little academic accounting theory.

271
00:16:38,647 --> 00:16:40,717
- It was just a thought.
- Bloom...

272
00:16:40,887 --> 00:16:43,924
...worlds are turned
on such thoughts.

273
00:16:44,087 --> 00:16:47,523
Don't you see, Bloom?
Darling Bloom, glorious Bloom.

274
00:16:47,687 --> 00:16:48,881
It's so simple.

275
00:16:49,047 --> 00:16:51,322
Step one,
we find the worst play ever written.

276
00:16:51,487 --> 00:16:53,557
Step two,
we hire the worst director in town.

277
00:16:53,847 --> 00:16:56,441
- Step three, I raise 2 million dollars.
- Two?

278
00:16:56,607 --> 00:16:59,917
Yes, one for me, one for you. There's
a lot of little old ladies out there.

279
00:17:00,087 --> 00:17:03,284
Step four, we hire the worst actors
in New York and open on Broadway.

280
00:17:03,447 --> 00:17:06,007
And before you can say "step five,"
we close on Broadway...

281
00:17:06,167 --> 00:17:08,965
...take our 2 million and go to Rio.

282
00:17:09,127 --> 00:17:11,595
Rio? That'd never work.

283
00:17:11,767 --> 00:17:14,122
Oh, ye of little faith.

284
00:17:15,767 --> 00:17:19,316
<i>What did Lewis say to Clark
When everything look ed bleak?</i>

285
00:17:19,487 --> 00:17:21,159
<i>What did Sir Edmund say to Tenzing</i>

286
00:17:21,327 --> 00:17:24,080
<i>As they struggled
Toward Everest's peak?</i>

287
00:17:24,247 --> 00:17:25,999
<i>What did Washington say
To his troops</i>

288
00:17:26,167 --> 00:17:28,123
<i>As they crossed the Delaware?</i>

289
00:17:28,287 --> 00:17:31,882
<i>I'm sure you're well aware</i>

290
00:17:32,047 --> 00:17:33,765
What'd they say?

291
00:17:33,927 --> 00:17:36,646
<i>We can do it</i>

292
00:17:36,807 --> 00:17:38,604
<i>We can do it</i>

293
00:17:38,767 --> 00:17:42,726
<i>We can do it
Me and you</i>

294
00:17:42,887 --> 00:17:44,479
<i>We can do it</i>

295
00:17:44,647 --> 00:17:46,478
<i>We can do it</i>

296
00:17:46,647 --> 00:17:49,764
<i>We can make our dreams come true</i>

297
00:17:49,927 --> 00:17:52,725
<i>Everything you've ever wanted</i>

298
00:17:52,887 --> 00:17:56,084
<i>Is just waiting to be had</i>

299
00:17:56,247 --> 00:17:59,523
<i>Beautiful girls
Wearing nothing but pearls</i>

300
00:17:59,687 --> 00:18:02,406
<i>Caressing you, undressing you
And driving you mad</i>

301
00:18:02,567 --> 00:18:04,205
No.

302
00:18:05,047 --> 00:18:07,322
Bloom. Bloom, wait a minute, now.

303
00:18:07,487 --> 00:18:10,957
Hear me out. Just think about it.

304
00:18:22,047 --> 00:18:23,685
Stop!

305
00:18:23,887 --> 00:18:26,481
<i>We can do it
We can do it</i>

306
00:18:26,647 --> 00:18:29,719
<i>This is not the time to shirk</i>

307
00:18:29,887 --> 00:18:32,720
<i>We can do it
You won't rue it</i>

308
00:18:32,887 --> 00:18:35,879
<i>Say goodbye to petty clerk</i>

309
00:18:36,047 --> 00:18:39,039

Don't you ever wanna become
a butterfly?

330

Don't you want to spread your wings

No!

332
00:19:54,127 --> 00:19:55,606
- Where to?
- Central Park.

333
00:19:55,767 --> 00:19:58,406
Gotta breathe. Gotta breathe.

Fail? How could it miss?
All you need is a little courage.

350
00:20:57,207 --> 00:20:59,675
Bloom, you know what you are?
You're like a...

You're like a...

- I'm a fountain?
- Yes, you're a fountain!

Don't you realize? There's a lot more
to you than there is to you.

355
00:21:13,327 --> 00:21:17,161
Mr. Bialystock, I'm afraid you've made
a terrible error in judgment.

356
00:21:17,327 --> 00:21:19,602
You've mistaken me
for someone with a spine.

357
00:21:19,767 --> 00:21:22,361
I'm going back
to Whitehall & Marks now.

You are six minutes late.
This is an accounting firm...

You can't come and go as you please.

A PA. A public accountant.

And I am a CPA.
A certified public accountant.

373

A rank a miserable little worm like
yourself could never hope to achieve.

Yes, Mr. Marks.
Thank you for speaking to me.

You're welcome.

00:22:58,327 --> 00:23:00,522
You never saw a person
humiliated before?

378
00:23:00,687 --> 00:23:04,475

...I didn't realize

00:30:44,087 --> 00:30:46,999
<i>Say goodbye to woe and gloom</i>

462
00:30:47,167 --> 00:30:50,318
<i>- With your brilliance, my resilience
- I'm gonna be a producer</i>

463

464
00:30:53,527 --> 00:30:56,485
<i>- We can do it, we can do it
- We can do it, we can do it</i>

465
00:30:56,647 --> 00:30:59,684
<i>Every show I touch I doom</i>

466

469
00:31:24,247 --> 00:31:25,726
Oh, Max...

470
00:31:25,887 --> 00:31:28,879
Oh, Max, let's give up.
I can't read anymore.

471
00:31:29,047 --> 00:31:32,437
- How many plays can a person read?
- Stop complaining.

472
00:31:32,607 --> 00:31:34,643
We have to find the worst play
ever written.

473
00:31:34,807 --> 00:31:36,684
- I've been reading all night.
- Who cares?

474
00:31:36,847 --> 00:31:39,964
You wanna be a producer, read,
read. Keep reading.

475
00:31:42,167 --> 00:31:43,566
Here's one.

476
00:31:43,727 --> 00:31:45,524
Act I, scene one.

477
00:31:45,687 --> 00:31:48,155
"Gregor Samsa awoke one morning
to discover...

478
00:31:48,327 --> 00:31:52,559
...that he had been transformed
into a giant cockroach. "

479
00:31:53,767 --> 00:31:55,883
No, too good.

480
00:31:58,887 --> 00:32:02,596
" But how could you see me?
The glass was frosted. "

481
00:32:02,767 --> 00:32:06,476
Wait a minute. Wait a minute.
I've read this before.

482
00:32:06,647 --> 00:32:10,686
I think I've read this one before.
What's it called? What's it called?

483
00:32:10,847 --> 00:32:12,405
<i>The Frosted Glass.</i>

484
00:32:12,567 --> 00:32:15,127
Max, I'm reading plays
that I read last night, Max.

485
00:32:15,287 --> 00:32:17,198
I can't go on anymore.
It's too much.

486
00:32:17,367 --> 00:32:20,882
Let's face it, we'll never find it.

487
00:32:28,807 --> 00:32:31,719
We'll never find it.
We'll never find it.

488
00:32:31,887 --> 00:32:34,799
We'll never find it.
We'll never find it.

489
00:32:34,967 --> 00:32:38,164
Leo. Leo. See it? Smell it.

490
00:32:38,327 --> 00:32:40,966
Touch it. Kiss it. Kiss it.

491
00:32:41,127 --> 00:32:42,401
It's the mother lode.

492
00:32:42,567 --> 00:32:44,558
- What is it? You found a flop?
- A flop.

493
00:32:44,727 --> 00:32:46,445
That's putting it mildly.

494
00:32:46,607 --> 00:32:48,279
This is a catastrophe.

495
00:32:48,447 --> 00:32:52,759
A disaster certain to offend peoples
of all races, creeds and religions.

496
00:32:52,927 --> 00:32:56,044
A guaranteed- to-close- in-one- night
beauty.

497
00:32:56,207 --> 00:32:58,880
- Well, let's see it.
- Here.

498
00:33:01,727 --> 00:33:03,718
<i>"Springtime for Hitler...</i>

499
00:33:03,887 --> 00:33:07,596
...a gay romp with Eva and Adolf
at Berchtesgaden. "

500
00:33:09,927 --> 00:33:12,077
Oh, my God.

501
00:33:12,607 --> 00:33:13,835
"Oh, my God" is right.

502
00:33:14,007 --> 00:33:16,919
It's practically a love letter to Hitler.

503
00:33:17,087 --> 00:33:20,557
- Max, this won't run a week.
- A week? Are you kidding?

504
00:33:20,727 --> 00:33:24,083
This play has got to close
on page four.

505
00:33:24,247 --> 00:33:25,600
What's the author's name again?

506
00:33:25,767 --> 00:33:29,999
" Franz Liebkind. 61 Jane Street,
New York, New York. "

507
00:33:30,167 --> 00:33:33,159
Franz Liebkind. 61 Jane Street.

508
00:33:33,327 --> 00:33:37,684
<i>Let's go. We'll get the Broadway
rights to Springtime for Hitler...</i>

509
00:33:37,847 --> 00:33:39,883
...even if we have to go so far
as to pay him.

510
00:33:40,887 --> 00:33:43,447
- Come on.
- This other hat, Max...

511
00:33:43,607 --> 00:33:45,040
...may I wear it?

512
00:33:45,207 --> 00:33:47,198
- No, you may not.
- Why?

513
00:33:47,367 --> 00:33:51,485
Because that
is a Broadway producer's hat.

514
00:33:51,647 --> 00:33:54,002
You don't get to wear
a Broadway producer's hat, son...

515
00:33:54,167 --> 00:33:56,397
...until you're a Broadway producer.

516
00:33:56,567 --> 00:33:58,319
And you're not
a Broadway producer until...

517
00:33:58,487 --> 00:34:01,763
I know, I know. Until I've produced
a show on Broadway.

518
00:34:01,927 --> 00:34:05,522
But I'm going to wear that hat,
and soon too, because...

519
00:34:05,687 --> 00:34:08,599
<i>We're gonna be the producers</i>

520
00:34:08,767 --> 00:34:12,726
<i>Of a great big Broadway flop</i>

521
00:34:21,687 --> 00:34:25,123
<i>Ja, ja, my Lieblings.</i>

522
00:34:25,767 --> 00:34:27,598
Let me grab you here.

523
00:34:27,767 --> 00:34:29,803
We have work to do.

524
00:34:29,967 --> 00:34:34,006
Hilda, my darling. Here, I have
written an important message...

525
00:34:34,167 --> 00:34:37,955
...which must reach
Ernst Schlongdorf.

526
00:34:38,127 --> 00:34:42,086
29 West Santiago Boulevard...

527
00:34:42,247 --> 00:34:44,556
...Buenos Aires, Argentina.

528
00:34:44,727 --> 00:34:46,604
AQAP.

529
00:34:46,767 --> 00:34:48,359
As quick as possible.

530
00:34:49,527 --> 00:34:51,404
Good.

531
00:34:51,567 --> 00:34:54,957
Fly, Hilda. Fly!

532
00:34:55,487 --> 00:34:57,523
Hilda, where are you going?

533
00:34:57,687 --> 00:35:00,076
Argentina's that way!

534
00:35:00,967 --> 00:35:02,719
Okay, chow time.

535
00:35:08,487 --> 00:35:10,955
Yummy, yummy, yummy.
Goes right into your belly.

536
00:35:11,127 --> 00:35:14,005
It's just a hunch,
but I'm betting this is our man.

537
00:35:14,167 --> 00:35:18,399
Max, he's wearing a German helmet
and lederhosen.

538
00:35:18,567 --> 00:35:21,320
Yeah, I know. Don't notice them.
Don't notice anything.

539
00:35:21,487 --> 00:35:25,196
Always look straight ahead.
Remember, we need that play.

540
00:35:26,407 --> 00:35:28,557
Franz Liebkind?

541
00:35:28,727 --> 00:35:31,764
I was never a member
of the Nazi Party!

542
00:35:31,927 --> 00:35:33,406
I only followed orders.

543
00:35:33,567 --> 00:35:35,876
I had nothing to do with the war.

544
00:35:36,047 --> 00:35:38,003
I didn't even know
there was a war on.

545
00:35:38,807 --> 00:35:40,445
We lived in the back...

546
00:35:40,607 --> 00:35:42,199
...right across from Switzerland.

547
00:35:42,367 --> 00:35:44,597
All we ever heard was yodelling.

548
00:35:51,407 --> 00:35:53,363
- Who are you?!
- Relax.

549
00:35:53,527 --> 00:35:55,597
Mr. Liebkind,
we're not from the government.

550
00:35:55,767 --> 00:35:57,997
We're producers,
Bialystock and Bloom...

551
00:35:58,167 --> 00:36:00,840
...here to talk to you about your play.
- My play?

552
00:36:01,007 --> 00:36:03,601
<i>You mean Springtime for...</i>

553
00:36:04,047 --> 00:36:06,163
...you-know-who?
- That's the one.

554
00:36:06,327 --> 00:36:09,364
- What about it?
- We love it. Don't we love it?

555
00:36:09,527 --> 00:36:12,803
- We think it's a masterpiece.
- We want to put it on Broadway.

556
00:36:12,967 --> 00:36:16,403
Broadway! Oh, joy of joys.

557
00:36:16,567 --> 00:36:18,956
Dream of dreams. I can't believe it.

558
00:36:19,127 --> 00:36:21,516
- I must tell my birds.
- Tell your birds.

559
00:36:21,687 --> 00:36:25,202
Otto, Bertha, Heinz,
Heidi, Wolfgang...

560
00:36:25,367 --> 00:36:27,483
...Adolf.

561
00:36:27,647 --> 00:36:29,080
Do you hear?

562
00:36:29,247 --> 00:36:32,557
We are finally going to clear
the Führer's name.

563
00:36:34,207 --> 00:36:35,845
Broadway!

564
00:36:36,887 --> 00:36:39,355
You know,
not many people know this...

565
00:36:39,527 --> 00:36:43,122
...but the Führer was a terrific dancer.
- Really?

566
00:36:43,287 --> 00:36:46,996
- We didn't know that, did we, Leo?
- No, no, we sure didn't.

567
00:36:47,167 --> 00:36:50,762
That's because you were taken in
by the BBC!

568
00:36:50,927 --> 00:36:53,919
Filthy British lies!

569
00:36:54,087 --> 00:36:58,478
But did they ever say a bad word
about Winston Churchill?

570
00:36:58,647 --> 00:37:00,877
Churchill!

571
00:37:01,647 --> 00:37:06,118
With his cigars, with his brandy
and his rotten paintings.

572
00:37:06,287 --> 00:37:07,766
Rotten!

573
00:37:07,927 --> 00:37:09,201
Hitler.

574
00:37:09,367 --> 00:37:11,005
There was a painter.

575
00:37:11,167 --> 00:37:14,000
He could paint an entire apartment
in one afternoon.

576
00:37:14,167 --> 00:37:16,044
Two coats.

577
00:37:16,207 --> 00:37:18,437
Yes. Yes.

578
00:37:18,607 --> 00:37:20,837
Yes, of course he could,
Mr. Liebkind.

579
00:37:21,007 --> 00:37:23,726
And that is exactly why
we wanna produce your play.

580
00:37:23,887 --> 00:37:26,959
Show the world the true Hitler.
The Hitler you loved...

581
00:37:27,127 --> 00:37:30,642
...the Hitler you knew,
the Hitler with a song in his heart.

582
00:37:30,807 --> 00:37:33,765
Here, Franz Liebkind.
Sign here...

583
00:37:33,927 --> 00:37:36,077
...and make your dream a reality.

584
00:37:37,207 --> 00:37:39,198
<i>- No.
- That's what "nein" means.</i>

585
00:37:39,367 --> 00:37:43,201
First you must prove to me
that you believe as I believe...

586
00:37:43,367 --> 00:37:47,758
...by joining with me and singing and
dancing the Führer's favourite tune:

587
00:37:47,927 --> 00:37:49,838
" Der Guten Tag Hop-Clop. "

588
00:37:50,647 --> 00:37:52,080
I know.

589
00:37:52,247 --> 00:37:54,477
- " Der Guten Tag Hop-Clop"?
- " Der Guten Tag Hop-Clop. "

590
00:37:54,647 --> 00:37:56,603
No. I could never sing
the Führer's favourite...

591
00:37:56,767 --> 00:37:57,916
Delighted. Delighted.

592
00:37:58,087 --> 00:38:00,647
...song.
- Shut up, he's almost ready to sign.

593
00:38:00,807 --> 00:38:04,083
All right. First you will roll up
your pants.

594
00:38:06,887 --> 00:38:08,718
- Rolling?
- Rolling.

595
00:38:08,887 --> 00:38:11,082
- Don't be stingy. Show some leg.
- Alrighty.

596
00:38:11,247 --> 00:38:12,475
- Good.
- Good.

597
00:38:12,647 --> 00:38:14,524
- Key of E?
- Is there any other?

598
00:38:18,647 --> 00:38:22,003
<i>Guten Tag hop hop
Guten Tag clop clop</i>

599
00:38:22,167 --> 00:38:25,637
<i>Ach, du lieber
Und oh, boy</i>

600
00:38:25,807 --> 00:38:29,356
<i>Guten Tag clap clap
Guten Tag slap slap</i>

601
00:38:29,527 --> 00:38:32,041
<i>Ach, du lieber
What a joy</i>

602
00:38:32,207 --> 00:38:36,485
<i>Oh, wir essen und fressen
Und tanzen und trink en</i>

603
00:38:36,647 --> 00:38:40,083
<i>Tanzen und trink en
Until we get stinkin'</i>

604
00:38:40,247 --> 00:38:42,841
<i>- Everybody!
- Guten Tag hop hop</i>

605
00:38:43,007 --> 00:38:44,440
<i>Guten Tag clop clop</i>

606
00:38:44,887 --> 00:38:48,277
<i>Guten Tag
Mein lieber Schatz</i>

607
00:38:48,447 --> 00:38:51,837
<i>So we hop our hops

608
00:38:52,007 --> 00:38:56,239
<i>Und we drink our Schnaps
Till we platz</i>

609
00:38:56,407 --> 00:38:58,921
You will sway?

610
00:38:59,767 --> 00:39:02,565
We will sway.

611
00:39:09,607 --> 00:39:11,279
Follow me.

612
00:39:11,447 --> 00:39:13,244
Very good.

613
00:39:29,247 --> 00:39:31,283
Whatever you say.

614
00:39:31,887 --> 00:39:34,799
<i>This is a tricky one</i>

615
00:39:49,047 --> 00:39:52,722
Oh, the Hop-Clop.
It's been so long!

616
00:39:57,327 --> 00:39:59,716
Sort of a Nazi hoedown.

617
00:40:06,967 --> 00:40:09,686
Gentlemen, you may
produce my play.

618
00:40:10,927 --> 00:40:12,360
Excellent. Excellent.

619
00:40:12,527 --> 00:40:14,757
Here we are. Here.

620
00:40:15,447 --> 00:40:18,598
But only if you take
the Siegfried Oath.

621
00:40:18,767 --> 00:40:20,564
The Siegfried Oath?
What's that?

622
00:40:20,727 --> 00:40:24,037
A pledge of eternal allegiance
to our beloved Führer.

623
00:40:24,207 --> 00:40:25,481
Never...

624
00:40:25,647 --> 00:40:27,683
...took that oath before.

625
00:40:27,847 --> 00:40:31,157
<i>One for me, one for you,
und one for you.</i>

626
00:40:31,327 --> 00:40:34,558
Never... Had one of those on before.
Thanks very much.

627
00:40:34,727 --> 00:40:36,957
- You're welcome.
- Nice colours.

628
00:40:37,127 --> 00:40:38,799
Oh, look, reversible.

629
00:40:38,967 --> 00:40:41,356
- Oh, yeah, you're right.
- Max.

630
00:40:41,527 --> 00:40:43,995
Max, we never
should have started this.

631
00:40:44,167 --> 00:40:46,237
I think we're getting in too deep.

632
00:40:46,407 --> 00:40:48,363
Too deep? This is nothing.

633
00:40:48,527 --> 00:40:51,121
I'll tell you when
we're getting in too deep.

634
00:40:51,287 --> 00:40:52,766
All right.

635
00:40:52,927 --> 00:40:55,361
First, you will raise
your right forefinger...

636
00:40:55,527 --> 00:40:57,518
<i>...und repeat after me.</i>

637
00:40:57,687 --> 00:40:59,996
I solemnly swear...

638
00:41:00,167 --> 00:41:03,682
- I solemnly swear...
- I solemnly swear...

639
00:41:03,847 --> 00:41:06,805
...to obey the sacred Siegfried Oath.

640
00:41:06,967 --> 00:41:10,801
...to obey the sacred Siegfried Oath.
... to obey the sacred Siegfried Oath.

641
00:41:10,967 --> 00:41:12,719
<i>- Und...

642
00:41:12,887 --> 00:41:14,081
<i>Und...</i>

643
00:41:14,247 --> 00:41:16,397
...never, never, never...

644
00:41:16,567 --> 00:41:20,037
...never, never, never...

645
00:41:21,727 --> 00:41:27,199
<i>...dishonour the spirit und the memory
of Adolf Elizabeth Hitler.</i>

646
00:41:27,367 --> 00:41:30,439
<i>...dishonour the spirit und the...
... dishonour the spirit und the...</i>

647
00:41:30,607 --> 00:41:31,926
- Elizabeth?
- Elizabeth?

648
00:41:32,087 --> 00:41:35,875
<i>Ja, that was his middle name.</i>

649
00:41:36,047 --> 00:41:37,685
Not many people know this...

650
00:41:37,847 --> 00:41:43,922
...but the Führer was descended
from a long line of English queens.

651
00:41:48,207 --> 00:41:50,198
Is that right?

652
00:41:51,367 --> 00:41:52,880
Yes.

653
00:41:53,407 --> 00:41:56,080
- Adolf Elizabeth Hitler.
- Adolf Elizabeth Hitler.

654
00:41:56,247 --> 00:41:59,523
- Good. Now I sign your contract.
- Excellent! Excellent.

655
00:41:59,687 --> 00:42:02,679
Here we are, sir.
Right here on the dotted line.

656
00:42:03,447 --> 00:42:05,199
There you are.
You shall never regret this.

657
00:42:05,367 --> 00:42:08,245
So thank you, Herr Liebkind.
Alrighty, then.

658
00:42:08,407 --> 00:42:10,238
Thank you.

659
00:42:13,207 --> 00:42:15,198
Let it go. Let it go.

660
00:42:15,367 --> 00:42:16,959
Halt!

661
00:42:17,127 --> 00:42:18,480
I forgot to tell you.

662
00:42:20,567 --> 00:42:23,923
The penalty for breaking
the Siegfried Oath...

663
00:42:24,087 --> 00:42:26,157
...is dess.

664
00:42:26,327 --> 00:42:28,079
" Dess"?

665
00:42:28,247 --> 00:42:29,919
<i>Is that anything like "death"?</i>

666
00:42:30,087 --> 00:42:32,442
Yeth.

667
00:42:33,967 --> 00:42:35,605
Sorry to hear that. Don't worry...

668
00:42:35,767 --> 00:42:38,759
...we'll iron out all these
thorny details over strudel.

669
00:42:38,927 --> 00:42:40,997
Ta-ta, big guy. Here we go...

670
00:42:44,567 --> 00:42:47,445
We're trapped! Trapped!

671
00:42:47,967 --> 00:42:49,366
Got it.

672
00:42:49,527 --> 00:42:51,279
Let's have lunch.

673
00:42:54,407 --> 00:42:56,682
What nice guys.

674
00:42:56,847 --> 00:42:58,246
Broadway.

675
00:42:58,407 --> 00:43:02,400
I haven't been so happy
since we crushed Poland.

676
00:43:05,727 --> 00:43:08,400
Hello, the living room of
renowned theatrical director...

677
00:43:08,567 --> 00:43:11,286
<i>...Roger DeBris' elegant
Upper East Side townhouse...</i>

678
00:43:11,447 --> 00:43:14,723
...on a sunny Tuesday
afternoon in June.

679
00:43:14,887 --> 00:43:17,321
Who may I say is calling?

680
00:43:17,927 --> 00:43:19,883
Listen, you broken- down
old queen...

681
00:43:20,047 --> 00:43:22,242
...he was drunk, he was hot,
you got lucky.

682
00:43:22,407 --> 00:43:24,523
- Don't ever call here again.
- Who was that?

683
00:43:24,687 --> 00:43:26,678
Wrong number.

684
00:43:35,807 --> 00:43:37,957
Yes?

685
00:44:02,447 --> 00:44:04,563
Well, hi there.

686
00:44:04,727 --> 00:44:08,003
I'm Max Bialystock and this
is my associate, Mr. Bloom.

687
00:44:08,167 --> 00:44:10,806
We have an appointment
with renowned theatrical director...

688
00:44:10,967 --> 00:44:13,527
...Roger DeBris.
- Ah, yes. Yes, please come in.

689
00:44:13,687 --> 00:44:16,326
- Please. Yes.
- Thank you.

690
00:44:26,127 --> 00:44:28,482
I am Carmen Ghia...

691
00:44:28,647 --> 00:44:31,878
...Mr. DeBris'
common-law assistant.

692
00:44:32,047 --> 00:44:34,163
You are expected.

693
00:44:39,887 --> 00:44:44,722
May I take your hat, your coat
and your swastikas?

694
00:44:45,247 --> 00:44:48,239
Oh, these. We... We...

695
00:44:48,407 --> 00:44:52,002
We just came from this big rally.
Everybody was wearing them.

696
00:44:53,447 --> 00:44:56,041
- You didn't tell me we had those on?
- I didn't notice them.

697
00:44:56,207 --> 00:45:01,679
- You told me to look straight ahead.
- Yes, all right. Let's not fight. Okay?

698
00:45:05,407 --> 00:45:07,762
Oh, Roger.

699
00:45:07,927 --> 00:45:10,805
We're not alone.

700
00:45:20,887 --> 00:45:24,880
Here's Roger.

701
00:45:29,447 --> 00:45:33,281
- Max, he's wearing a dress.
- No kidding.

702
00:45:33,447 --> 00:45:35,358
Roger, good to see you again.

703
00:45:35,527 --> 00:45:38,564
Messrs. Bialystock and Bloom,
I presume?

704
00:45:38,727 --> 00:45:40,558
Forgive the pun.

705
00:45:42,527 --> 00:45:44,563
- What pun?
- Shut up. He thinks he's witty.

706
00:45:44,727 --> 00:45:49,198
Roger, may I say you look gorgeous.
Absolutely gorgeous.

707
00:45:50,567 --> 00:45:53,240
<i>By the way, Max, darling,
we loved Funny Boy, didn't we?</i>

708
00:45:53,407 --> 00:45:54,476
Worshipped it.

709
00:45:54,647 --> 00:45:56,877
<i>To be or not to be
You mean a lot to me</i>

710
00:45:57,047 --> 00:45:59,242
- Showstopper!
- Fabulous.

711
00:46:00,087 --> 00:46:03,079
Oh, dear. Your Mr. Bloom
is staring at my gown.

712
00:46:03,847 --> 00:46:05,678
- Well, I was...
- I should explain.

713
00:46:05,847 --> 00:46:09,522
I'm going to the Choreographers' Ball.
There is a prize for best costume.

714
00:46:09,687 --> 00:46:13,475
- We always win.
- I'm not so sure about this year.

715
00:46:13,647 --> 00:46:16,605
I'm supposed to be
the Grand Duchess Anastasia...

716
00:46:16,767 --> 00:46:19,918
...but I think I look more like
the Chrysler Building.

717
00:46:21,167 --> 00:46:24,876
Well, as far as I'm concerned, without
your wig on, you're only half dressed.

718
00:46:25,047 --> 00:46:28,198
Well, then,
why don't you go and get it...

719
00:46:28,367 --> 00:46:31,803
...oh, Wicked Witch of the West.

720
00:46:34,527 --> 00:46:36,119
If your intention...

721
00:46:36,287 --> 00:46:40,883
...was to shoot an arrow
through my heart...

722
00:46:42,167 --> 00:46:44,203
...bull's- eye!

723
00:46:47,927 --> 00:46:51,317
Oh, Roger, let's face it,
that building is you.

724
00:46:51,487 --> 00:46:54,160
Listen, I know we sent it to you
only this morning...

725
00:46:54,327 --> 00:46:56,363
<i>...but did you read
Springtime for Hitler?</i>

726
00:46:56,527 --> 00:46:58,722
Read it? I devoured it.

727
00:46:58,887 --> 00:47:01,162
And I find it remarkable.
Remarkable!

728
00:47:01,327 --> 00:47:05,115
I feel it is a very important piece,
drenched with historical goodies.

729
00:47:05,287 --> 00:47:08,404
I, for one, for instance,
never realized that the Third Reich...

730
00:47:08,567 --> 00:47:10,558
...meant Germany.

731
00:47:10,727 --> 00:47:13,036
Yeah, how about that.
Then you'll do it?

732
00:47:13,207 --> 00:47:17,246
Do it? Of course not. It's not my
kind of thing. I mean, Max, please.

733
00:47:17,407 --> 00:47:21,400
World War II?
Too dark, too depressing.

734
00:47:21,567 --> 00:47:24,320
<i>The theatre's so obsessed
With dramas so depressed</i>

735

<i>It's hard to sell a tick et on Broadway</i>

736

<i>Shows should be more pretty

737
00:47:31,087 --> 00:47:32,645
<i>Shows should be more</i>

738
00:47:32,807 --> 00:47:35,002
<i>What's the word?</i>

739
00:47:35,167 --> 00:47:37,965
- Gay?
- Exactly.

740
00:47:38,127 --> 00:47:41,802
<i>No matter what you do on the stage</i>

741
00:47:41,967 --> 00:47:45,164
<i>Keep it light, k eep it bright
Keep it gay</i>

742
00:47:45,327 --> 00:47:48,956
<i>Whether it's murder
Mayhem or rage</i>

743
00:47:49,127 --> 00:47:53,200
<i>Don't complain, it's a pain
Keep it gay</i>

744
00:47:53,367 --> 00:47:56,564
<i>People want laughter
When they see a show</i>

745
00:47:56,727 --> 00:47:59,924
<i>The last thing they're after is
A litany of woe</i>

746
00:48:00,087 --> 00:48:03,762
<i>A happy ending
Will pep up your play</i>

<i>Oedipus won't bomb</i>

748
00:48:05,727 --> 00:48:07,319
<i>If he winds up with Mom</i>

749
00:48:07,487 --> 00:48:09,125
<i>- Keep it gay

750
00:48:09,287 --> 00:48:11,437
<i>- Keep it gay

751
00:48:11,607 --> 00:48:12,881
Couldn't agree more.

752
00:48:13,047 --> 00:48:14,639
And you have our blessings,
Roger...

753
00:48:14,807 --> 00:48:18,641
<i>...to make Springtime for Hitler just
as gay as anyone could possibly want.</i>

754
00:48:18,807 --> 00:48:20,240
So come on, do it for us. Please.

755
00:48:20,407 --> 00:48:23,399
I'm sorry, Max.
It's simply not my cup of tea.

756
00:48:23,567 --> 00:48:26,081
Still, fair is fair.

757
00:48:26,247 --> 00:48:28,556
I should ask my production team
what they think.

758
00:48:28,727 --> 00:48:30,206
Your production team,
who are they?

759
00:48:30,367 --> 00:48:32,403
You'll see. They all live here.

760
00:48:32,567 --> 00:48:35,764
Guys! Come say hello
to Bialystock and Bloom!

761
00:48:35,927 --> 00:48:38,202
This is my set designer, Brian.

762
00:48:38,367 --> 00:48:39,356
Hello.

763
00:48:39,527 --> 00:48:42,599
<i>Keep it mad, k eep it glad

00:48:46,647 --> 00:48:50,242
<i>Keep it happy, k eep it snappy

767
00:48:54,047 --> 00:48:57,437
<i>That everything's perfect

768
00:48:57,607 --> 00:48:59,723
Scott, my choreographer.

769
00:48:59,887 --> 00:49:01,525
Hi there.

770
00:49:17,047 --> 00:49:19,800
And, finally, last and least...

771
00:49:19,967 --> 00:49:23,755
...my lighting designer,
Shirley Markowitz.

772
00:49:25,167 --> 00:49:27,965
<i>Keep it gay
Keep it gay</i>

773
00:49:28,127 --> 00:49:31,039
<i>Keep it gay</i>

774
00:49:35,127 --> 00:49:38,324
<i>Now, they all just read Springtime.
What did you think of it, fellas?</i>

775
00:49:38,487 --> 00:49:40,398
<i>- It needs glamour
- And glitz</i>

776
00:49:40,567 --> 00:49:43,764
<i>- It needs sequins
- And tits</i>

777
00:49:43,927 --> 00:49:47,283
Leo. Leo, I think we're losing them.

778
00:49:47,447 --> 00:49:50,359
Go say something nice to Roger.
I think he likes you.

779
00:49:50,527 --> 00:49:54,486
- But, Max...
- Go on. It's just show biz.

780
00:49:59,567 --> 00:50:02,445
Mr. DeBris. Roger.

781
00:50:02,607 --> 00:50:05,997
Roger, actually,
I think your gown is very stunning.

782
00:50:06,167 --> 00:50:07,839
Why, thank you, Mr. Bloom.

783
00:50:08,007 --> 00:50:09,838
Leo.

784
00:50:11,087 --> 00:50:13,521
What is that enchanting
cologne you're wearing?

785
00:50:13,687 --> 00:50:15,279
Me? I'm not wearing any cologne.

786
00:50:15,447 --> 00:50:18,757
You mean that smell is you?

787
00:50:18,927 --> 00:50:20,997
Oh, God.

788
00:50:21,167 --> 00:50:27,163
If I could bottle you, I'd shove you
under my armpits every day.

789
00:50:36,247 --> 00:50:38,317
Oh, Max.
Max, we never should've started this.

790
00:50:38,487 --> 00:50:42,480
- I think we're getting in too deep.
- Too deep? This is nothing.

791
00:50:42,647 --> 00:50:44,877
I'll tell you when
we're getting in too deep.

792
00:50:45,287 --> 00:50:47,278
<i>And so the rule is</i>

<i>Keep it funny
Keep it sunny</i>

795
00:50:51,607 --> 00:50:53,643
<i>Keep it gay</i>

796
00:50:53,807 --> 00:50:57,720
- What should we do?
- Relax. Watch this.

797
00:50:57,887 --> 00:51:00,082
Roger, I...

798
00:51:00,247 --> 00:51:04,877
<i>I think that Springtime for Hitler would
be a marvellous opportunity for you.</i>

799
00:51:05,047 --> 00:51:07,925
I mean, up to now,
you've always been associated with...

800
00:51:08,087 --> 00:51:09,998
Dare I say it?... frivolous musicals.

801
00:51:10,167 --> 00:51:12,078
You're right.
I've often felt as though...

802
00:51:12,247 --> 00:51:14,966
...I've been throwing my life away
on silly entertainments.

803
00:51:15,127 --> 00:51:17,721
Dopey showgirls in gooey gowns.

804
00:51:17,887 --> 00:51:20,401
Two, three, kick, turn, turn, turn,
kick, turn.

805
00:51:20,567 --> 00:51:22,285
- Roger.
- It's enough to make you heave.

806
00:51:22,447 --> 00:51:25,678
<i>Nonetheless, I'm sorry, Max, I just
couldn't do Springtime for Hitler.</i>

807
00:51:25,847 --> 00:51:27,599
- Why not? Think of the respect.
- No.

808
00:51:27,767 --> 00:51:29,359
- Think of the prestige.
- No, no, no.

809
00:51:29,527 --> 00:51:30,960
Think of the Tony!

810
00:51:31,967 --> 00:51:35,596
<i>Tony, Tony, Tony, Tony, Tony</i>

811
00:51:35,767 --> 00:51:37,405
- What's the matter?
- Is he all right?

812
00:51:37,567 --> 00:51:38,761
- He's having a stroke.
- What?

813
00:51:38,927 --> 00:51:41,043
- Of genius!
- I see it at last.

814
00:51:41,207 --> 00:51:43,243
The chance
to do something important.

815
00:51:43,407 --> 00:51:46,399
<i>Roger DeBris presents
History</i>

816
00:51:46,567 --> 00:51:48,558
Of course that second act
has to be rewritten.

817
00:51:48,727 --> 00:51:51,958
They're losing the war? Excuse me,
that's too downbeat.

It's a wild idea,

- Please.

Wait a minute.
This is a very big decision.

841
00:52:52,007 --> 00:52:53,759
It might affect the course of my life.

00:57:27,447 --> 00:57:31,281
<i>Let the whole world hear
What you're about</i>

926
00:57:31,447 --> 00:57:34,484
<i>Clothes may make the man
All a girl needs is a tan</i>

927
00:57:34,887 --> 00:57:38,880
<i>When you got it
Let it hang out</i>

928
00:57:39,047 --> 00:57:40,958
- Remember when Ulla dance?
- Yeah.

929
00:57:41,127 --> 00:57:42,321
Ulla dance again.

930
00:57:42,967 --> 00:57:46,004
Ulla dance again!

931
00:58:01,567 --> 00:58:05,276
<i>When I was just a little girl
In Sweden</i>

932
00:58:05,447 --> 00:58:09,201
<i>My thoughtful mother
Gave me this advice</i>

933
00:58:09,367 --> 00:58:13,042
<i>If nature blesses you
From top to bottom</i>

934
00:58:13,207 --> 00:58:16,005
<i>Show that top to bottom
Don't think twice</i>

935
00:58:16,167 --> 00:58:18,237
Now Ulla belt.

936
00:58:18,407 --> 00:58:22,161
<i>Don't think twice!</i>

937
00:58:22,327 --> 00:58:24,522
<i>When you got it</i>

938
00:58:24,687 --> 00:58:26,279
<i>Share it</i>

939
00:58:26,447 --> 00:58:30,201
<i>Let the public feast
Upon your charms</i>

940
00:58:30,367 --> 00:58:33,916
<i>People say that being prim
Is proper</i>

941
00:58:34,087 --> 00:58:37,284
<i>But every showgirl knows
That prim will stop her</i>

942
00:58:37,447 --> 00:58:39,722
<i>When you got it</i>

943
00:58:39,887 --> 00:58:41,605
<i>Give it</i>

944
00:58:41,767 --> 00:58:46,557
<i>Don't be selfish
Give it all away</i>

945
00:58:51,127 --> 00:58:52,719
<i>Don't be shy
Be bold and cute</i>

946
00:58:52,887 --> 00:58:54,639
<i>Show the boys your birthday suit</i>

947
00:58:54,807 --> 00:58:57,844
<i>When you got it</i>

948
00:58:58,607 --> 00:59:01,644
<i>If you got it</i>

949
00:59:02,407 --> 00:59:05,399
<i>Once you got it</i>

950
00:59:05,567 --> 00:59:07,762
<i>Shout out</i>

951
00:59:10,087 --> 00:59:14,080
<i>Hooray!</i>

952
00:59:21,047 --> 00:59:22,560
Okey- dokey.

953
00:59:22,727 --> 00:59:23,921
You like it?

954
00:59:24,087 --> 00:59:26,317
Like... Like it?

955
00:59:26,487 --> 00:59:29,923
I want you to know, my dear,
that even though we're sitting down...

956
00:59:30,087 --> 00:59:34,000
...we're giving you
a standing ovation.

957
00:59:38,567 --> 00:59:41,206
She's in the show.

958
00:59:41,367 --> 00:59:46,157
Wait, Max. Max, we don't even know
if there's a part for her in the show.

959
00:59:46,327 --> 00:59:49,205
Would you excuse us, my dear?

960
00:59:49,367 --> 00:59:51,119
Nonsense, Bloom.

961
00:59:51,287 --> 00:59:53,198
Bloom,
do I have to teach you everything?

962
00:59:53,367 --> 00:59:55,722
There is always a part
for the producer's girlfriend.

963
00:59:55,887 --> 00:59:58,481
But we don't even know
when we're starting rehearsal yet.

964
00:59:58,647 --> 01:00:02,526
So what? So what?
We're producers, aren't we?

965
01:00:02,687 --> 01:00:05,520
So until she goes into the show,
she can work for us here.

966
01:00:05,687 --> 01:00:10,317
<i>Because we need...
Nay, deserve to have ourselves a...</i>

967
01:00:11,607 --> 01:00:15,520
<i>Deserve to have ourselves a gorgeous
Swedish secretary/receptionist.</i>

968
01:00:15,687 --> 01:00:19,441
But, Max, a secretary who doesn't
speak English? What will people say?

969
01:00:19,607 --> 01:00:21,359
They'll say:

970
01:00:23,367 --> 01:00:25,927
Offer her the job, please?

971
01:00:26,847 --> 01:00:28,200
Just a moment, miss.

972
01:00:29,687 --> 01:00:31,245
We might have a position for you.

973
01:00:31,407 --> 01:00:35,241
As a matter of fact, we might
have several positions for you.

974
01:00:35,407 --> 01:00:36,886
Until the show gets going...

975
01:00:37,047 --> 01:00:41,359
...we can offer you a job here
as a secretary/receptionist.

976
01:00:41,527 --> 01:00:44,803
Secretary/receptionist?

977
01:00:44,967 --> 01:00:47,435
Okey/dokey!

978
01:00:47,607 --> 01:00:48,801
I can do that.

979
01:00:50,767 --> 01:00:53,076
Answer telephone.

980
01:00:53,247 --> 01:00:55,203
Bialystock and Bloom.

981
01:00:55,367 --> 01:00:56,959
Bialystock and Bloom.

982
01:00:57,127 --> 01:00:58,355
Smart as a whip.

983
01:00:58,527 --> 01:01:00,597
You're hired!

984
01:01:05,287 --> 01:01:08,882
Well... Well, all right. If he says so,
I don't have a...

985
01:01:11,047 --> 01:01:13,242
Secretary/receptionist.

986
01:01:13,407 --> 01:01:15,762
And maybe you can tidy up
around here a little bit too.

987
01:01:15,927 --> 01:01:17,758
Tidy up? Tidy up.

988
01:01:17,927 --> 01:01:20,202
Such a funny word.
What means "tidy up"?

989
01:01:20,367 --> 01:01:22,961
- You know, clean.
- Make look nice.

990
01:01:23,127 --> 01:01:26,483
- Oh, yeah. Ulla can make tidy up.
- Very good.

991
01:01:26,647 --> 01:01:28,717
What time can you be here
in the morning?

992
01:01:28,887 --> 01:01:32,038
Well, Ulla wake up every morning,
5 a. m.

993
01:01:32,207 --> 01:01:34,596
From 5 to 7, Ulla like to exercise.

994
01:01:34,767 --> 01:01:37,804
From to 7 to 8,
Ulla like to take long shower.

995
01:01:37,967 --> 01:01:41,880
From to 8 to 9, Ulla like
to have big Swedish breakfast.

996
01:01:42,047 --> 01:01:43,924
Many different herrings.

997
01:01:44,087 --> 01:01:47,762
From to 9 to 11, Ulla like to practice
her singing and her dancing.

998
01:01:47,927 --> 01:01:51,397
And at 11, Ulla like to have sex.

999
01:01:51,567 --> 01:01:53,842
What time should I get here?

1000
01:01:54,007 --> 01:01:55,122
- Eleven.
- Eleven.

1001
01:01:55,287 --> 01:01:57,926
Good. Ulla will come at 11.

1002
01:01:58,087 --> 01:02:00,806
Ulla will come at 11.

1003
01:02:09,487 --> 01:02:12,081
God bless America!

1004
01:02:14,367 --> 01:02:17,006
God bless Sweden.

1005
01:02:17,327 --> 01:02:20,717
Oh, Max. Max, she's fantastic.

1006
01:02:20,887 --> 01:02:23,401
The most beautiful girl
I've ever seen.

1007
01:02:23,567 --> 01:02:25,125
I've never felt this way before.

1008
01:02:25,287 --> 01:02:28,324
It's like a volcano erupting
inside of me...

1009
01:02:28,487 --> 01:02:33,356
...like hot lava rising higher
and higher and...

1010
01:02:33,527 --> 01:02:35,404
What is that, Max?

1011
01:02:35,567 --> 01:02:37,637
What is it?

1012
01:02:39,287 --> 01:02:42,836
It's called an erection.
It's either that or malaria.

1013
01:02:43,607 --> 01:02:45,837
But don't worry,
they have shots for everything now.

1014
01:02:45,967 --> 01:02:47,241
Come here,
I want to show you something.

1015
01:02:49,567 --> 01:02:51,285
- What do you see?
- Nothing.

1016
01:02:51,447 --> 01:02:54,723
Exactly. But now that we've got
our sure- fire flop...

1017
01:02:54,887 --> 01:02:58,084
...it's gonna be our job
to fill that safe with 2 million dollars.

1018
01:02:58,247 --> 01:03:01,922
Two million?
Gee, how much do we put in?

1019
01:03:11,927 --> 01:03:15,556
How much...?
How much do we put in?

1020
01:03:15,727 --> 01:03:17,399
Bloom...

1021
01:03:17,567 --> 01:03:20,843
...the two cardinal rules
of being a Broadway producer...

1022
01:03:21,007 --> 01:03:24,238
...are one, never put
your own money in the show.

1023
01:03:24,407 --> 01:03:25,601
And two?

1024
01:03:25,767 --> 01:03:31,205
Never put your own money
in the show!

1025
01:03:32,727 --> 01:03:34,080
- Get it?
- Got it.

1026
01:03:34,247 --> 01:03:36,203
- Good.
- So how do we raise the money?

1027
01:03:36,367 --> 01:03:38,961
How? I'll tell you how.

1028
01:03:40,167 --> 01:03:41,520
From my investors.

1029
01:03:41,687 --> 01:03:43,484
Hundreds of little old ladies...

1030
01:03:43,647 --> 01:03:48,562
...all looking to Max Bialystock for one
last thrill on their way to the cemetery.

1031
01:03:48,727 --> 01:03:52,436
So in the days to come, Bloom,
you shall see very little of me.

1032
01:03:52,607 --> 01:03:54,882
And right now,
I'd like to see very little of you.

1033
01:03:55,047 --> 01:03:57,003
Scram while I get myself ready.

1034
01:03:57,167 --> 01:04:00,876
For Max Bialystock
is about to launch himself...

1035
01:04:01,047 --> 01:04:03,402
...into little- old-lady land.

1036
01:04:04,727 --> 01:04:07,639
<i>The time has come</i>

1037
01:04:07,807 --> 01:04:12,039
<i>To be a lover from the Argentine</i>

1038
01:04:12,207 --> 01:04:16,564
<i>To slick my hair down
With brilliantine</i>

1039
01:04:16,727 --> 01:04:22,962
<i>And gargle heavily
With Listerine</i>
