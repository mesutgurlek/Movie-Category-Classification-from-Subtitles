1
00:00:16,182 --> 00:00:18,719
<i>The American West is big.</i>

2
00:00:18,785 --> 00:00:20,492
<i>You'd think there was plenty of
room here, wouldn't you,</i>

3
00:00:20,553 --> 00:00:22,089
<i>for all who needed room?</i>

4
00:00:22,155 --> 00:00:25,534
<i>But people began finding
conditions too crowded</i>

5
00:00:25,592 --> 00:00:27,435
<i>and they spread out.</i>

6
00:00:27,494 --> 00:00:31,340
<i>For this is the story of the
"miracle sea in the desert,"</i>

7
00:00:31,398 --> 00:00:32,809
<i>the Salton Sea.</i>

8
00:00:32,866 --> 00:00:35,210
<i>385 square miles of water,</i>

9
00:00:35,268 --> 00:00:37,407
<i>formed by accident
back in 1905,</i>

10
00:00:37,470 --> 00:00:41,213
<i>when the Colorado River
ran wild over manmade dikes.</i>

11
00:00:41,274 --> 00:00:45,620
<i>A sea in the desert, with its
white sandy beaches, it's--</i>

12
00:00:45,678 --> 00:00:46,918
<i>The Salton Sea,</i>

13
00:00:46,980 --> 00:00:48,926
<i>the new recreational capital
of the world.</i>

14
00:00:48,982 --> 00:00:51,292
<i>The future is now.</i>

15
00:00:51,351 --> 00:00:57,131
<i>And you-- you have been present
at the birth of a city.</i>

16
00:01:36,863 --> 00:01:40,504
Love is a combination
of several things:

17
00:01:40,567 --> 00:01:44,572
trust, caring, honesty--

18
00:01:44,637 --> 00:01:47,413
which honesty
is the biggest thing.

19
00:01:47,474 --> 00:01:49,977
And I'll just bet
my bottom dollar,

20
00:01:50,043 --> 00:01:51,852
it was beautiful to you

21
00:01:51,911 --> 00:01:56,382
to see your dad give your mom
a hug and a kiss.

22
00:01:56,449 --> 00:02:00,693
If you see love
between your parents,

23
00:02:00,753 --> 00:02:04,132
even if it's just once
in awhile,

24
00:02:04,190 --> 00:02:08,229
that would
install love in you.

25
00:02:08,294 --> 00:02:11,070
If you don't, you're gonna be
a long, lonesome dude

26
00:02:11,131 --> 00:02:13,236
in a far away place.

27
00:02:21,708 --> 00:02:24,621
The desert
is very unforgiving.

28
00:02:24,677 --> 00:02:28,784
It has no mercy on anybody
or anyone.

29
00:02:28,848 --> 00:02:34,025
To live on it, you have to
improvise in order to survive.

30
00:02:53,806 --> 00:02:55,080
Whoo!

31
00:02:55,141 --> 00:02:56,552
Where's the dead bird?

32
00:02:59,612 --> 00:03:00,750
Right there.

33
00:03:00,813 --> 00:03:04,454
Look inside this,
while he's right here.

34
00:03:04,517 --> 00:03:06,929
Ew!

35
00:03:06,986 --> 00:03:08,829
Listen, you want
a piece of gum?

36
00:03:11,224 --> 00:03:14,228
Sarah, will you pass me
my chips?

37
00:03:14,294 --> 00:03:15,830
I really love those.

38
00:03:15,895 --> 00:03:16,737
Ooh!

39
00:03:16,796 --> 00:03:18,104
Ooh!

40
00:03:18,164 --> 00:03:19,507
Ooh!

41
00:03:25,805 --> 00:03:27,978
We're gonna have to
climb over here.

42
00:03:29,809 --> 00:03:32,255
You were grounded
for one week for throwing rocks

43
00:03:32,312 --> 00:03:33,916
at another child.

44
00:03:36,316 --> 00:03:38,318
You were fighting on the bus
and you threw a rock

45
00:03:38,384 --> 00:03:39,920
at another child today.

46
00:03:39,986 --> 00:03:41,522
Remember that?

47
00:03:41,588 --> 00:03:45,730
And you hit her in the head
and made her bleed?

48
00:03:45,792 --> 00:03:47,396
- Was it her?
- Mm-hmm.

49
00:03:47,460 --> 00:03:49,599
I thought that was William
'cause his head was bleeding.

50
00:03:49,662 --> 00:03:51,608
There was more than one.

51
00:03:51,664 --> 00:03:54,235
There was three,
actually.

52
00:03:54,300 --> 00:03:56,610
- I know what this is for.
- What?

53
00:03:56,669 --> 00:03:59,582
Because this is
for the cut.

54
00:03:59,639 --> 00:04:02,085
This thing is for cookies.

55
00:04:02,141 --> 00:04:04,451
- Yeah.
- And the white ones.

56
00:04:04,510 --> 00:04:07,047
This one is to--
it's Ritalin.

57
00:04:07,113 --> 00:04:09,024
What this one does--

58
00:04:09,082 --> 00:04:11,062
Is you know when you
run around a lot,

59
00:04:11,117 --> 00:04:14,394
and you can't stop moving,
and you're very hyper?

60
00:04:14,454 --> 00:04:18,027
This is supposed to make you
where you don't do that.

61
00:04:18,091 --> 00:04:20,264
- Calms you down.
- Is that new, Mom?

62
00:04:20,326 --> 00:04:22,135
No, that's not new.

63
00:04:22,195 --> 00:04:25,904
He's been taking that for
almost two years.

64
00:04:25,965 --> 00:04:30,436
And this one,
Resveratrol, is for--

65
00:04:30,503 --> 00:04:31,948
Crazy?

66
00:04:32,005 --> 00:04:34,576
No, you're not crazy,
sweetie.

67
00:04:34,641 --> 00:04:37,144
Don't ever think
you're crazy, okay?

68
00:04:37,210 --> 00:04:39,247
Happy Birthday,
dear Benny...

69
00:04:39,312 --> 00:04:41,314
Make a wish!

70
00:04:44,317 --> 00:04:46,058
Benny,
what'd you wish for?

71
00:04:46,119 --> 00:04:50,795
I wished for Mom and Dad
to love me all year long.

72
00:04:50,857 --> 00:04:52,859
Bubbles, woo-hoo!

73
00:04:55,328 --> 00:04:56,568
- Are you ready?
- Yeah.

74
00:04:56,629 --> 00:04:58,472
- Are you ready?
- No.

75
00:04:58,531 --> 00:05:00,374
Yes!

76
00:05:00,433 --> 00:05:01,741
Let's get it on!

77
00:05:05,972 --> 00:05:07,576
Bring it, bring it!

78
00:05:15,782 --> 00:05:19,252
- Bring it!
- Okay, you ready?

79
00:05:19,319 --> 00:05:20,662
More!

80
00:06:10,570 --> 00:06:12,709
I left home
when I was 13.

81
00:06:17,310 --> 00:06:21,156
My father told me,
many years ago,

82
00:06:21,214 --> 00:06:25,026
"The harder you work,
the richer you will die."

83
00:06:30,056 --> 00:06:34,869
"Is richness what you have
learned, by experience,

84
00:06:34,927 --> 00:06:38,238
or the amount of dollars
you can get in the bank?"

85
00:06:44,604 --> 00:06:47,551
Around a lot of the places in
the Southwest part

86
00:06:47,607 --> 00:06:49,143
of the country here,

87
00:06:49,208 --> 00:06:52,314
the state cannot tax
the Indian reservation

88
00:06:52,378 --> 00:06:54,858
for the cigarettes.

89
00:06:54,914 --> 00:06:58,054
So they sell 'em a little
cheaper.

90
00:06:58,117 --> 00:07:01,997
So if you buy them there,
you can bootleg a few of them

91
00:07:02,054 --> 00:07:05,433
and make a few pennies profit.

92
00:07:05,491 --> 00:07:09,303
Well, you might say,
well, that's illegal.

93
00:07:09,362 --> 00:07:13,868
You'd have to figure out a way,
at your golden age,

94
00:07:13,933 --> 00:07:16,504
to support yourself,
at least partially.

95
00:07:25,478 --> 00:07:28,152
Where's your master, huh?

96
00:07:28,214 --> 00:07:30,160
Hey, Justin?

97
00:07:30,216 --> 00:07:32,059
Do you know where Jerry is?

98
00:07:32,118 --> 00:07:33,722
No, I don't.

99
00:07:35,721 --> 00:07:39,168
Like I said, I haven't
seen him since Wednesday.

100
00:07:39,225 --> 00:07:42,832
Well, that'll be the last
fucking bill he gets on me.

101
00:07:42,895 --> 00:07:45,307
I got a damned near $300
phone bill this month.

102
00:07:50,636 --> 00:07:54,243
The desert has
a lot of poor people.

103
00:07:54,307 --> 00:07:56,947
For different reasons,
they are poor.

104
00:07:57,009 --> 00:07:59,046
They wanna bum a cigarette.

105
00:07:59,111 --> 00:08:00,317
Why bum?

106
00:08:00,379 --> 00:08:02,188
Why damn, for a quarter,
I'd sell 'em one.

107
00:08:06,452 --> 00:08:09,831
Sometimes I wonder where
my next meal is coming from.

108
00:08:09,889 --> 00:08:12,233
I've been that way
all my life.

109
00:08:12,291 --> 00:08:13,793
But I sure enjoyed it.

110
00:08:32,411 --> 00:08:37,861
# I been a #

111
00:08:37,917 --> 00:08:40,830
# Moonshiner #

112
00:08:43,723 --> 00:08:48,934
# For 17 long years #

113
00:08:52,431 --> 00:08:58,643
# I spent all my money #

114
00:09:01,641 --> 00:09:08,149
# On whiskey and beer #

115
00:09:10,683 --> 00:09:15,154
# God bless them
pretty women #

116
00:09:15,221 --> 00:09:19,294
# I wish they was mine #

117
00:09:22,261 --> 00:09:25,071
# Their breath is #

118
00:09:25,131 --> 00:09:30,080
# As sweet as #

119
00:09:30,136 --> 00:09:32,912
# The dew on the vine #

120
00:09:58,164 --> 00:09:59,768
Ooh.

121
00:09:59,832 --> 00:10:03,143
We're goin' off-road
golf cartin' driving.

122
00:10:03,202 --> 00:10:04,306
Left turn!

123
00:10:04,370 --> 00:10:05,849
- Watch out for that hole!
- I got this!

124
00:10:05,905 --> 00:10:07,578
- I got-- I got...
- I told you.

125
00:10:07,640 --> 00:10:09,051
I got it.

126
00:10:11,210 --> 00:10:15,022
Shoo, shoo, shoo, shoo, shoo,
shoo, shoo, shoo...

127
00:10:15,081 --> 00:10:16,992
- Man, let me drive.
- Nope.

128
00:10:17,049 --> 00:10:19,325
This is the other
bar right here.

129
00:10:19,385 --> 00:10:21,194
- Uh, it's open.
- I know.

130
00:10:21,253 --> 00:10:23,199
Could I see the-- the menu?

131
00:10:26,525 --> 00:10:30,701
A cheeseburger and onion rings,
and a hamburger and fries.

132
00:10:47,446 --> 00:10:50,655
Will you tell him
to get up, dude?

133
00:10:50,716 --> 00:10:53,287
- What happened?
- Some fucking dickhead.

134
00:10:53,352 --> 00:10:56,993
Could've been-- might've been
just a common mistake.

135
00:10:57,056 --> 00:10:59,832
No one lookin'
or whatever and--

136
00:10:59,892 --> 00:11:01,530
He just kept going?
He hit you?

137
00:11:01,594 --> 00:11:03,631
Both--

138
00:11:03,696 --> 00:11:05,937
Most people do.

139
00:11:05,998 --> 00:11:07,705
Did he...

140
00:11:07,767 --> 00:11:09,007
What the hell?
What's hurting?

141
00:11:09,068 --> 00:11:11,207
Your back or your arm?

142
00:11:11,270 --> 00:11:13,944
It's all sides,
fucked up.

143
00:11:14,006 --> 00:11:16,077
- Can you move your leg?
- The leg, too?

144
00:11:16,142 --> 00:11:17,849
No, that's fine.

145
00:11:17,910 --> 00:11:19,856
- It's just your shoul--
- My shoulder and my arm.

146
00:11:19,912 --> 00:11:21,983
Mm, his shit is broke,
see it?

147
00:11:22,048 --> 00:11:24,187
It's something.

148
00:11:24,250 --> 00:11:25,854
It'll heal.

149
00:11:25,918 --> 00:11:27,158
It'll heal.

150
00:11:27,219 --> 00:11:28,755
You need to go to the doctor
or something.

151
00:11:28,821 --> 00:11:30,198
You need to get up.

152
00:11:30,256 --> 00:11:31,496
But if you want to lay down,
just lay down.

153
00:11:31,557 --> 00:11:33,093
Don't get up,
just lay down.

154
00:11:33,159 --> 00:11:34,729
- Yeah, sure, man.
- You just gonna stay here?

155
00:11:34,794 --> 00:11:36,330
But please don't--

156
00:11:36,395 --> 00:11:37,635
We're not, we're not,
we're not.

157
00:11:37,697 --> 00:11:39,472
I don't want
nobody botherin' nothin'.

158
00:11:39,532 --> 00:11:40,533
- All right.
- All right.

159
00:11:40,599 --> 00:11:42,078
- I'll handle it.
- You're-- you're okay?

160
00:11:42,134 --> 00:11:43,636
- You're all right?
- Yeah, thank you very much.

161
00:11:43,703 --> 00:11:45,114
- All right then.
- Yeah, all right.

162
00:11:45,171 --> 00:11:46,479
I'll remember your face,
probably.

163
00:11:46,539 --> 00:11:47,677
All right.

164
00:12:00,820 --> 00:12:04,324
And it's not funny juice.

165
00:12:04,390 --> 00:12:06,734
His arm is broken,
can you see it?

166
00:12:06,792 --> 00:12:07,896
Probably.

167
00:12:07,960 --> 00:12:09,769
His arm-- arm right here
is broke.

168
00:12:09,829 --> 00:12:11,672
I'm not gonna touch--
I'm not gonna touch you.

169
00:12:11,731 --> 00:12:13,438
Is your arm broken?

170
00:12:13,499 --> 00:12:15,137
Above his elbow, look at it.

171
00:12:15,201 --> 00:12:16,839
Right here?

172
00:12:16,902 --> 00:12:18,540
You gotta go in the hospital now
and get it looked at.

173
00:12:18,604 --> 00:12:19,912
I'll take care of it.

174
00:12:19,972 --> 00:12:21,508
You need to go to the hospital,
seriously, to get a--

175
00:12:21,574 --> 00:12:23,451
If it starts bleeding
inside, you'll bleed to death.

176
00:12:23,509 --> 00:12:24,954
Thank God.

177
00:14:32,471 --> 00:14:34,473
I thought I wasn't
gonna like it out here.

178
00:14:34,540 --> 00:14:36,281
But it's better than LA,
to me.

179
00:14:54,159 --> 00:14:58,005
Eight, nine,
15, 17, 18, 30.

180
00:14:58,063 --> 00:15:00,202
- I'm not ready!
- Here I come or not.

181
00:15:05,638 --> 00:15:07,174
- Whoa.
- How do I get down?

182
00:15:07,239 --> 00:15:09,048
Hey, how did you get
all the way up there?

183
00:15:09,108 --> 00:15:10,086
What the--?

184
00:15:10,142 --> 00:15:11,587
How'd he get up there?

185
00:15:14,246 --> 00:15:17,557
Go back there and look,
your happy face...

186
00:15:17,616 --> 00:15:19,391
Benny, Mom's playing--

187
00:15:19,451 --> 00:15:23,092
- Turn the light on!
- Come on.

188
00:15:23,155 --> 00:15:25,226
Aah!

189
00:15:25,291 --> 00:15:27,237
- I wasn't ready!
- No, you were--

190
00:15:27,293 --> 00:15:31,264
- One, two...
- Hurry up and run!

191
00:15:31,330 --> 00:15:34,004
You can't use a flashlight,
that's not hide-and-seek.

192
00:15:34,066 --> 00:15:36,512
Ten, nine, eight, seven,

193
00:15:36,568 --> 00:15:40,516
six, five, four, three,
two, one.

194

<i>KSWT, TV 13 Weekend News.</i>

195
00:15:51,951 --> 00:15:55,330

205
00:16:16,375 --> 00:16:19,254
The Parrish Family
liked to play Army.

206
00:16:19,311 --> 00:16:21,848
FBI attempted to get 'em
as terrorists.

207
00:16:21,914 --> 00:16:24,019
You gotta remember
this is one year after 9/11.

208
00:16:24,083 --> 00:16:26,654
Even though it occurred in
August 2002,

209
00:16:26,719 --> 00:16:28,096
after we have a heavy rain,

210
00:16:28,153 --> 00:16:29,757
it uncovers a lot of
the ordnance

211
00:16:29,822 --> 00:16:33,770
that has been covered
with dirt or buried.

212
00:16:33,826 --> 00:16:36,306
Goddamn.

213
00:16:36,362 --> 00:16:38,501
It hasn't gone off.

214
00:16:38,564 --> 00:16:40,908
Well, we'll just put a block of
C4 on it and make it go bye-bye.

215
00:16:44,236 --> 00:16:46,807
Ooh, look at the shrapnel.

216
00:16:46,872 --> 00:16:49,011
I'm glad those people
are doing good.

217
00:16:49,074 --> 00:16:50,917
They are now, they are.

218
00:16:50,976 --> 00:16:52,956
They're--
they're doing great.

219
00:16:53,012 --> 00:16:55,117
Hard to believe it's the same
Parrish Family, you know?

220
00:17:00,152 --> 00:17:02,029
Sometimes I think,
what else can we do

221
00:17:02,087 --> 00:17:03,532
with our family here?

222
00:17:03,589 --> 00:17:05,262
Because there's nothing.

223
00:17:05,324 --> 00:17:10,137
All we could do is go riding in
the desert, shoot guns.

224
00:17:10,195 --> 00:17:12,232
But we can't do that anymore.

225
00:17:12,297 --> 00:17:15,335
Child Protective Services
already took the kids twice,

226
00:17:15,401 --> 00:17:18,348
so if they take them again
for the third time,

227
00:17:18,404 --> 00:17:22,181
they told us that
we would never see them again.

228
00:17:22,241 --> 00:17:24,619
How did Stephanie know
that CPS was here?

229
00:17:24,676 --> 00:17:28,522
Sabrina told me that she saw 'em
at a house when he drove by,

230
00:17:28,580 --> 00:17:31,220
and there were county cars
and the sheriffs.

231
00:17:31,283 --> 00:17:33,320
And if they're
gonna take kids away,

232
00:17:33,385 --> 00:17:34,887
there's gonna be
a sheriff there.

233
00:17:34,953 --> 00:17:37,024
'Cause you can't-- they can't
take 'em without a sheriff.

234
00:17:37,089 --> 00:17:39,433
- They had three sheriffs there.
- I know, so...

235
00:17:41,794 --> 00:17:43,239
But you know what?

236
00:17:43,295 --> 00:17:44,968
We're not doing
anything wrong.

237
00:17:45,030 --> 00:17:48,375
And we're-- our house has been,
you know--

238
00:17:48,434 --> 00:17:50,641
- Clean?
- Cleaned.

239
00:17:50,702 --> 00:17:54,081
So, if they come, all you need
to do is tell 'em the truth.

240
00:17:54,139 --> 00:17:56,619
- Or, just say...
- That you're happy.

241
00:17:56,675 --> 00:17:58,712
You have a house.

242
00:17:58,777 --> 00:18:00,154
You're not take--
You're taken care of.

243
00:18:00,212 --> 00:18:02,715
Or just say...
"I'm begging you, I'm sorry."

244
00:18:04,650 --> 00:18:06,857
"Please don't take me."

245
00:18:06,919 --> 00:18:10,196
After we got back from prison
and we got the kids back,

246
00:18:10,255 --> 00:18:13,293
I noticed Benjamin
was a little different than

247
00:18:13,358 --> 00:18:14,837
the other children.

248
00:18:14,893 --> 00:18:17,271
- This is my bunny, huh?
- Mm-hmm.

249
00:18:17,329 --> 00:18:19,536
Because I'm a girl.

250
00:18:19,598 --> 00:18:22,238
This is my backpack.

251
00:18:22,301 --> 00:18:23,939
Funny, Mom.

252
00:18:24,002 --> 00:18:25,447
I'm a girl.

253
00:18:28,574 --> 00:18:31,555
I'll be back soon, Harry.

254
00:18:31,610 --> 00:18:34,819
I can go to school, like,
playing nicely.

255
00:18:34,880 --> 00:18:36,587
Yeah, you can.

256
00:18:36,648 --> 00:18:40,619
I can say,
"Hello, pretty girl,

257
00:18:40,686 --> 00:18:42,666
I love you."

258
00:18:42,721 --> 00:18:44,928
Well, I don't know about that--
you can say hi.

259
00:18:44,990 --> 00:18:47,800
Well, this ain't Halloween.

260
00:18:47,860 --> 00:18:49,305
Bye.

261
00:18:52,531 --> 00:18:53,908
What's this, Mommy?

262
00:18:53,966 --> 00:18:55,707
- A bullet.
- Oh, that's a bullet.

263
00:18:55,767 --> 00:18:57,041
Can I see it?
Can I have it?

264
00:18:57,102 --> 00:18:58,604
Throw that over there,
okay?

265
00:18:58,670 --> 00:19:01,150
- Can I throw it in the water?
- No.

266
00:19:01,206 --> 00:19:05,018
- Because it will scare fish?
- It might.

267
00:19:05,077 --> 00:19:06,954
Look at the wave.

268
00:19:07,012 --> 00:19:08,457
I know,
they're beautiful, huh?

269
00:19:08,514 --> 00:19:10,084
I'm gonna go in the wave.

270
00:19:10,149 --> 00:19:12,891
I think they're gonna
be big this time.

271
00:19:12,951 --> 00:19:16,125
- I'm gonna go in the big wave.
- Yeah.

272
00:19:16,188 --> 00:19:19,362
I'm gonna take off my shoes,
I'm gonna go really far.

273
00:19:19,424 --> 00:19:20,869
Yeah.

274
00:19:20,926 --> 00:19:22,428
Well, you don't
have to hold me.

275
00:19:22,494 --> 00:19:24,235
- You can watch, huh?
- Yep.

276
00:19:24,296 --> 00:19:25,673
You can watch me.

277
00:19:25,731 --> 00:19:28,143
- I won't drown.
- I won't let you drown.

278
00:19:28,200 --> 00:19:31,340
- Because you will run quick.
- Yep.

279
00:19:31,403 --> 00:19:34,475
I'm gonna be
swimming like a dolphin.

280
00:19:34,540 --> 00:19:37,316
Dolphins don't go
in here, huh?

281
00:19:37,376 --> 00:19:41,415
No, it's too salty,
I think they're in the ocean.

282
00:19:41,480 --> 00:19:44,984
- Is this the ocean?
- No, it's just the sea.

283
00:19:50,656 --> 00:19:53,967
Dead fish, I hate dead fish,
'cause if I step on 'em,

284
00:19:54,026 --> 00:19:58,236
it will get inside my shoes,
inside my foot.

285
00:19:58,297 --> 00:20:00,675
What kind of a fish would you be
if you could be a fish?

286
00:20:00,732 --> 00:20:02,837
- A fish.
- What kind of fish?

287
00:20:02,901 --> 00:20:07,043
Like a silly fish,
or purple, or...?

288
00:20:07,105 --> 00:20:08,516
A happy fish.

289
00:20:08,574 --> 00:20:10,747
A happy fish,
that's a good one.

290
00:20:10,809 --> 00:20:13,813
I think I would be
a happy fish, too.

291
00:20:13,879 --> 00:20:15,859
We've got fishes!

292
00:20:15,914 --> 00:20:17,951
Where you going?

293
00:20:25,524 --> 00:20:28,471
The main thing I remember
is throwing up so hard

294
00:20:28,527 --> 00:20:30,336
that there was nothing
left but bulimic acid.

295
00:20:30,395 --> 00:20:31,635
Yeah.

296
00:20:31,697 --> 00:20:33,608
I mean, I could just barely
force the water down.

297
00:20:33,665 --> 00:20:35,372
Hydrochloric acid
is like, aah.

298
00:20:35,434 --> 00:20:36,674
Oh, man.

299
00:20:40,539 --> 00:20:42,075
Now that is a salad.

300
00:21:00,892 --> 00:21:05,204
I baked 150 pork chops,
so I think we have enough.

301
00:21:05,264 --> 00:21:07,039
Come here,
you smell real cute.

302
00:21:07,099 --> 00:21:08,578
Well, you-- you better
be careful because--

303
00:21:08,634 --> 00:21:10,170
You come here, come here now.

304
00:21:10,235 --> 00:21:12,977
I-- I ain't gonna be sexy with
you, I just wanna smell you.

305
00:21:13,038 --> 00:21:15,746
It's gonna cost you
a dollar a whiff.

306
00:21:15,807 --> 00:21:19,254
Can-- hey, can I charge
a pack 'til the ninth?

307
00:21:19,311 --> 00:21:22,258
It's when I get my money,
you know?

308
00:21:22,314 --> 00:21:24,487
Well damnit,
if I charge cigarettes, I--

309
00:21:24,549 --> 00:21:27,155
I know, blah, blah,
blah, blah, blah, blah.

310
00:21:27,219 --> 00:21:30,223
Don't blah-blah me,
the hell with it.

311
00:21:30,289 --> 00:21:32,428
Because goddamn, there's
too many that's owed me

312
00:21:32,491 --> 00:21:34,368
and they still
owe me up today.

313
00:21:34,426 --> 00:21:36,064
Yeah, but I don't do that.

314
00:21:36,128 --> 00:21:38,039
Well, they didn't either,
they said, until they owed me.

315
00:21:38,096 --> 00:21:40,042
Whatever, okay,
well, I-- you know, my...

316
00:22:50,302 --> 00:22:52,407
Hey.

317
00:22:52,471 --> 00:22:54,678
Were you sitting there
for a long time?

318
00:22:54,740 --> 00:22:56,310
Just for a cool minute.

319
00:22:56,375 --> 00:22:58,355
You got bored or are you just
having fun throwing rocks

320
00:22:58,410 --> 00:22:59,445
in the water?

321
00:23:06,017 --> 00:23:09,226
- Like that?
- That was good.

322
00:23:09,287 --> 00:23:11,267
Maybe it's just stuck
on something.

323
00:23:14,526 --> 00:23:17,336
Maybe you just stuck
on being impatient.

324
00:23:17,396 --> 00:23:19,171
What you wanna do
Fourth of July, Day-day?

325
00:23:19,231 --> 00:23:21,268
Well, we could go to Calipat.

326
00:23:21,333 --> 00:23:22,676
And do what?
What you wanna do?

327
00:23:22,734 --> 00:23:23,906
I know what you wanna do.

328
00:23:23,969 --> 00:23:25,971
Go mess around and pop
some fireworks.

329
00:23:26,037 --> 00:23:28,074
I'm thinking 'bout some girls,
I'm talking some girls.

330
00:23:28,140 --> 00:23:29,881
No, we gonna pop
some fireworks.

331
00:23:29,941 --> 00:23:31,818
- Oh...
- Yeah.

332
00:23:31,877 --> 00:23:33,823
Pop some cherries, you mean,
yeah, yeah, yeah...

333
00:23:33,879 --> 00:23:35,415
My rocket is ready to launch.

334
00:23:35,480 --> 00:23:37,323
Yeah, right.

335
00:23:37,382 --> 00:23:38,861
How many cherries
you gonna pop?

336
00:23:38,917 --> 00:23:40,658
Um, one, hopefully.

337
00:23:40,719 --> 00:23:42,062
- One?
- Yeah.

338
00:23:42,120 --> 00:23:43,827
That's your goal, that's all
you're goin' for?

339
00:23:43,889 --> 00:23:44,924
Yeah.

340
00:23:44,990 --> 00:23:46,628
Disappointment,
disappointment.

341
00:23:46,691 --> 00:23:48,796
But I'm a virgin, so I have to
go for one good one.

342
00:23:48,860 --> 00:23:51,466
Naw, you go for
six, seven, eight, nine.

343
00:23:51,530 --> 00:23:53,476
Don't laugh like that.

344
00:23:56,802 --> 00:23:58,577
Let me see it.

345
00:23:58,637 --> 00:24:01,140
You can stop
looking at him.

346
00:24:01,206 --> 00:24:03,186
All right.

347
00:24:03,241 --> 00:24:04,845
- Why you do that?
- Ooh!

348
00:24:07,379 --> 00:24:10,292
- Put it in the bucket.
- No, that little-bitty thing...

349
00:24:10,348 --> 00:24:12,794
Okay, well, put it back in the
water, don't just let it die.

350
00:24:12,851 --> 00:24:14,455
Oh, my God.

351
00:24:17,155 --> 00:24:18,600
I hope you get hooked.

352
00:24:18,657 --> 00:24:20,466
- Stupid.
- You're stupid.

353
00:24:20,525 --> 00:24:22,527
You're the one
that walked past it.

354
00:24:24,763 --> 00:24:26,743
Pick it up.

355
00:24:26,798 --> 00:24:30,041
Don't kick it,
just pick it up.

356
00:24:30,101 --> 00:24:31,603
See?

357
00:24:31,670 --> 00:24:33,115
Now it's probably dead.

358
00:24:41,646 --> 00:24:43,216
Happy?

359
00:24:43,281 --> 00:24:44,692
- Ooh.
- Ooh.

360
00:24:44,749 --> 00:24:46,592
Bitch, I like you,
but your attitude stank.

361
00:24:46,651 --> 00:24:47,595
Bitch, I like you, but--

362
00:24:50,322 --> 00:24:52,529
These stay fresh all day.

363
00:24:52,591 --> 00:24:54,229
We in a recession.

364
00:24:54,292 --> 00:24:56,932
You can use it when you
masturbatin' if you washin' it.

365
00:24:56,995 --> 00:24:58,668
Get the beat, get the beat,
get the beat!

366
00:25:03,802 --> 00:25:05,145
Hey!

367
00:25:50,015 --> 00:25:51,756
Don't fall.

368
00:25:53,318 --> 00:25:55,059
Shit!

369
00:25:55,120 --> 00:25:58,499
I'm so fly, I'm so fly like
I say, it's the Fourth of July.

370
00:25:58,557 --> 00:26:03,438
I'm so fly, I'm so fly, like I
say, it's the Fourth of July.

371
00:26:03,495 --> 00:26:06,169
Bitch, I like you,
but your attitude stank.

372
00:26:06,231 --> 00:26:08,302
Bitch I like you, but your
attitude stank.

373
00:26:08,366 --> 00:26:10,812
Stank, stank, stank, stank.

374
00:26:18,310 --> 00:26:20,654
Use this tonight.

375
00:26:20,712 --> 00:26:22,123
I'm gonna lose my virginity...

376
00:26:22,180 --> 00:26:23,318
You a virgin?

377
00:26:23,381 --> 00:26:24,689
- You a virgin?
- Of course not.

378
00:26:24,749 --> 00:26:26,126
Yeah?

379
00:26:26,184 --> 00:26:29,028
All right, me and you are gonna
lose our virginity, watch.

380
00:26:29,087 --> 00:26:30,589
You're gonna die
a virgin now, bitch.

381
00:26:33,224 --> 00:26:35,704
I'm tellin' you,
today's our day.

382
00:26:35,760 --> 00:26:37,068
Bitch-ass nigga!

383
00:26:48,473 --> 00:26:52,114
Oh, oh, oh, oh...

384
00:26:55,246 --> 00:26:58,625
Oh, oh, oh, oh.

385
00:26:58,683 --> 00:27:00,185
Oh!

386
00:27:07,826 --> 00:27:09,737
What's up with that girl you--
you-- you fucked?

387
00:27:09,794 --> 00:27:12,138
- Nothin'.
- You lost your V-Card?

388
00:27:12,197 --> 00:27:13,642
Alls you need to know
is that it happened.

389
00:27:13,698 --> 00:27:15,143
- Big tits?
- I-D-K.

390
00:27:15,200 --> 00:27:16,873
- You didn't lick 'em?
- Naw.

391
00:27:16,935 --> 00:27:18,642
- You didn't suck on 'em?
- She had her shirt on.

392
00:27:18,703 --> 00:27:20,114
- Why didn't you take it off?
- Lame-O.

393
00:27:20,171 --> 00:27:22,447
It was like a-- like a shirt,
like a big shirt on,

394
00:27:22,507 --> 00:27:24,111
but she didn't have
nothing on up under it.

395
00:27:24,175 --> 00:27:25,711
Sexy.

396
00:27:25,777 --> 00:27:27,484
- So where'd you fuck her at?
- In the bathroom.

397
00:27:27,545 --> 00:27:28,990
You didn't get in
the shower with her?

398
00:27:29,047 --> 00:27:30,424
- Aw, nah.
- You didn't jump in?

399
00:27:30,482 --> 00:27:32,291
Naw, she was like,
"Bring my bra."

400
00:27:32,350 --> 00:27:34,227
And I brung her bra, she was
like, "Thank you."

401
00:27:34,285 --> 00:27:36,390
I caught him in a lie,
I caught him in a lie there.

402
00:27:36,454 --> 00:27:37,865
He said it, yeah,
didn't he-- didn't--

403
00:27:37,922 --> 00:27:39,401
Yeah, he did,
you lie, you liar!

404
00:27:39,457 --> 00:27:40,697
You didn't lose your
virginity!

405
00:27:40,759 --> 00:27:41,965
Why, why you say that?

406
00:27:42,027 --> 00:27:43,472
'Cause you just said,
"She had a long shirt on,

407
00:27:43,528 --> 00:27:44,939
and she didn't have nothing
underneath."

408
00:27:44,996 --> 00:27:47,203
Eddie, you're lame-- you just
lied, we caught you in a lie.

409
00:27:47,265 --> 00:27:49,040
- Okay.
- Liar.

410
00:27:51,836 --> 00:27:52,507
What's your name?

411
00:27:55,240 --> 00:27:56,378
Star.

412
00:27:56,441 --> 00:27:58,580
What are you gonna be
when you grow up?

413
00:27:58,643 --> 00:28:01,749
- I'm gonna be a weirdo.
- A weirdo?

414
00:28:01,813 --> 00:28:03,986
When you grow up, not now.

415
00:28:04,049 --> 00:28:05,858
I'm going to Mama's
because...

416
00:28:05,917 --> 00:28:07,590
I wanna be a fireman.

417
00:28:07,652 --> 00:28:10,599
A fireman!

418
00:28:10,655 --> 00:28:13,226
And how have you been
for the past two months?

419
00:28:13,291 --> 00:28:14,793
- Good.
- Okay.

420
00:28:14,859 --> 00:28:18,136
- How did school end for you?
- I don't know.

421
00:28:18,196 --> 00:28:19,698
Did you remember
your grades?

422
00:28:19,764 --> 00:28:21,266
He's failing
every subject.

423
00:28:21,332 --> 00:28:22,606
Oh, wow, okay.

424
00:28:22,667 --> 00:28:24,010
And he wasn't doing good.

425
00:28:24,069 --> 00:28:26,606
He was, um, not allowed on
the playground no more.

426
00:28:26,671 --> 00:28:29,083
How'd it make you feel, Benny?

427
00:28:29,140 --> 00:28:30,346
I don't know.

428
00:28:30,408 --> 00:28:32,615
We can't help you if you
don't tell us.

429
00:28:32,677 --> 00:28:35,157
- One thing we can do.
- Mm-hmm?

430
00:28:35,213 --> 00:28:37,022
Is we can actually increase
the dose of the medicine.

431
00:28:37,082 --> 00:28:39,995
That probably would be the
simplest way of controlling

432
00:28:40,051 --> 00:28:43,294
what's in his anger or his mood
swings, and things like that.

433
00:28:43,354 --> 00:28:45,800
There are people who take
up to 2,000 milligrams

434
00:28:45,857 --> 00:28:47,097
of this medicine.

435
00:28:47,158 --> 00:28:48,432
Wow.

436
00:28:48,493 --> 00:28:50,734
But for a child, though,
wouldn't it be better

437
00:28:50,795 --> 00:28:52,433
to try a different medicine,
though,

438
00:28:52,497 --> 00:28:53,874
and not put him
at risk like that?

439
00:28:53,932 --> 00:28:55,206
Well, it depends.

440
00:28:55,266 --> 00:28:56,768
There is another medication
called Abilify,

441
00:28:56,835 --> 00:29:00,146
which is also approved for,
one, bipolar, in children--

442
00:29:00,205 --> 00:29:02,617
Yeah, you know,
anger of a person.

443
00:29:02,674 --> 00:29:05,814
What about, um,
his hyperness?

444
00:29:05,877 --> 00:29:07,185
The Ritalin.

445
00:29:07,245 --> 00:29:08,781
It's a very short-acting
medicine.

446
00:29:08,847 --> 00:29:10,952
- It wears off in three hours.
- It does.

447
00:29:11,015 --> 00:29:13,359
He might need to take the
medicine several times.

448
00:29:13,418 --> 00:29:15,796
You might give it
to him three times a day.

449
00:29:15,854 --> 00:29:17,527
I think that might provide
better coverage.

450
00:29:17,589 --> 00:29:18,590
Okay--

451
00:29:21,793 --> 00:29:23,329
Oooh!

452
00:29:25,230 --> 00:29:26,470
- Mwah.
- Mwah.

453
00:29:26,531 --> 00:29:27,908
- Mwah.
- Mwah!

454
00:29:27,966 --> 00:29:29,206
Mwah!

455
00:29:29,267 --> 00:29:30,405
Teach me how.

456
00:29:33,104 --> 00:29:36,176
You just pinch your mouth
like this.

457
00:29:36,241 --> 00:29:38,778
It's like kissing someone.

458
00:29:38,843 --> 00:29:41,517
- Michael loves Rebecca.
- Stop!

459
00:29:41,579 --> 00:29:44,185
Michael loves Rebecca.

460
00:29:44,249 --> 00:29:45,728
Oh, that's gotta stop
right now,

461
00:29:45,784 --> 00:29:47,161
'cause you guys are little.

462
00:29:47,218 --> 00:29:49,198
You're not old enough
for any of that.

463
00:29:49,254 --> 00:29:51,825
This means "I love you"
in the bunny way.

464
00:29:51,890 --> 00:29:54,928
Sure, I always wanted
to be a waitress.

465
00:29:54,993 --> 00:29:56,563
Michael wants you
to do that thing again.

466
00:29:56,628 --> 00:29:58,005
No, don't put it back.

467
00:29:58,062 --> 00:30:00,099
Ah, that's disgusting!

468
00:30:00,165 --> 00:30:01,576
What happened?

469
00:30:01,633 --> 00:30:03,806
He just put it back in when it
was cracked and it was yolky.

470
00:30:03,868 --> 00:30:05,643
- Ew!
- And it fell on the floor.

471
00:30:14,012 --> 00:30:16,151
Don't have a Jeep.

472
00:30:16,214 --> 00:30:18,216
I don't know if I can
go on a date.

473
00:30:18,283 --> 00:30:20,593
- I don't have a job.
- You have a job.

474
00:30:20,652 --> 00:30:22,359
Figure it out.

475
00:30:22,420 --> 00:30:23,490
What?

476
00:30:23,555 --> 00:30:27,469
"Do you want Rebecca and Michael
to have a date?

477
00:30:27,525 --> 00:30:29,801
Write yes or no."

478
00:30:29,861 --> 00:30:30,965
And I wrote this.

479
00:30:31,029 --> 00:30:32,372
And then my dad circled "no."

480
00:30:32,430 --> 00:30:33,738
That was, um, um...

481
00:30:42,006 --> 00:30:43,451
You're not going.

482
00:30:45,577 --> 00:30:48,387
Okay, we only have,
like, ten bucks.

483
00:30:51,816 --> 00:30:53,921
We-- we do everything.

484
00:30:53,985 --> 00:30:56,192
It doesn't involve you.

485
00:30:56,254 --> 00:30:58,234
It doesn't involve you
at all.

486
00:30:58,289 --> 00:31:00,929
It tastes like sushi.

487
00:31:03,061 --> 00:31:06,042
Amber and Sarah
is gonna be the waitress.

488
00:31:06,097 --> 00:31:07,667
We're in charge of everything,

489
00:31:07,732 --> 00:31:10,269
so you guys can relax and talk
to each other.

490
00:31:14,472 --> 00:31:16,418
It doesn't involve you.

491
00:31:16,474 --> 00:31:19,284
I got a class at home--
At school.

492
00:31:25,950 --> 00:31:27,861
Class.

493
00:31:27,919 --> 00:31:29,296
Class.

494
00:31:29,354 --> 00:31:30,492
Like a gentleman.

495
00:31:48,706 --> 00:31:52,449
# Come sit at the table #

496
00:31:52,510 --> 00:31:57,721
# Under October's #

497
00:31:57,782 --> 00:32:04,563
# Able skies #

498
00:32:09,627 --> 00:32:14,508
# Once we'd seen eye to eye #

499
00:32:14,565 --> 00:32:18,980
# I'd known that
I'd pass you by #

500
00:32:19,037 --> 00:32:21,984
# And I tried #

501
00:32:24,809 --> 00:32:29,121
# The bells chime #

502
00:32:29,180 --> 00:32:33,253
# Seven times #

503
00:32:33,318 --> 00:32:37,494
# Completed at nine #

504
00:32:37,555 --> 00:32:44,268
# The world moves slower
I find #

505
00:32:49,267 --> 00:32:53,477
# No but I #

506
00:32:53,538 --> 00:33:00,615
# Learned of time
by your hand #

507
00:33:06,517 --> 00:33:10,590
# And in shallow waters' end #

508
00:33:10,655 --> 00:33:15,161
# I learned not to swim #

509
00:33:15,226 --> 00:33:19,936
# But to lie #

510
00:33:19,998 --> 00:33:23,536
# I'll wait for now #

511
00:33:23,601 --> 00:33:27,947
# Till it's ready to burn out #

512
00:33:28,006 --> 00:33:31,954
# I insist on doubts #

513
00:33:32,010 --> 00:33:37,153
# We're already lying
on the glass #

514
00:33:37,215 --> 00:33:42,995
# The glass ##

515
00:35:18,483 --> 00:35:21,430
Okay, let's circle, people.

516
00:35:21,486 --> 00:35:26,060
As y'all know, we lost Danny,
Jeff and Franklin this week.

517
00:35:26,124 --> 00:35:29,333
When you're born in 1924
and you're black,

518
00:35:29,393 --> 00:35:31,373
it's not an easy life.

519
00:35:31,429 --> 00:35:32,737
Okay, let's start.

520
00:35:32,797 --> 00:35:35,437
- Good gravy.
- Good gravy.

521
00:35:35,500 --> 00:35:37,002
- Good meat.
- Good meat.

522
00:35:37,068 --> 00:35:38,706
- Good Lord.
- Good Lord.

523
00:35:38,769 --> 00:35:40,248
Let's eat.

524
00:35:40,304 --> 00:35:41,942
- All my friends.
- Yeah.

525
00:35:42,006 --> 00:35:44,509
Jeff, Franklin.

526
00:35:44,575 --> 00:35:47,146
My wife.

527
00:35:47,211 --> 00:35:51,125
Well, I'll tell ya, but goddamn,
you know, three in a week,

528
00:35:51,182 --> 00:35:53,628
that's getting pretty
goddamned...

529
00:35:57,522 --> 00:35:59,195
Yeah, well, Franklin,
now let me see,

530
00:35:59,257 --> 00:36:01,032
he's only about seven months
older than I was.

531
00:36:01,092 --> 00:36:02,435
Mm-hmm.

532
00:36:10,568 --> 00:36:12,605
CeeJay, what do I do
when she say this?

533
00:36:12,670 --> 00:36:14,411
CeeJay, what I do
if she says...

534
00:36:14,472 --> 00:36:15,951
This is how you start
a conversation.

535
00:36:16,007 --> 00:36:18,214
You go up to
her and be like--

536
00:36:18,276 --> 00:36:19,778
Excuse me, you know
what time it is?

537
00:36:19,844 --> 00:36:22,017
That's how you
start a conversation!

538
00:36:22,079 --> 00:36:24,582
You ask her what time it is,
you say, never mind,

539
00:36:24,649 --> 00:36:26,128
I don't want the time,
I wanted to talk to you.

540
00:36:26,184 --> 00:36:27,720
No, hold on,
hold on, hold on.

541
00:36:27,785 --> 00:36:31,733
- All right, she-- She say--
- You the voice.

542
00:36:31,789 --> 00:36:34,429
I talk to her, you respond.

543
00:36:34,492 --> 00:36:36,699
Excuse me,
do you know what time it is?

544
00:36:36,761 --> 00:36:39,139
Say it now, say it now.

545
00:36:39,197 --> 00:36:41,370
I know what time it is,
but you got your phone so why,

546
00:36:41,432 --> 00:36:43,434
why you giving her the time?

547
00:36:43,501 --> 00:36:44,844
Excuse me.

548
00:36:44,902 --> 00:36:47,143
Do you know what time it is?

549
00:36:47,205 --> 00:36:48,411
Okay, dude, okay.

550
00:36:48,472 --> 00:36:50,076
You know, why do you need to
know what time it is

551
00:36:50,141 --> 00:36:51,518
when you have a phone?

552
00:36:51,576 --> 00:36:53,886
'Cause I wanted
to hear it from you.

553
00:36:55,846 --> 00:36:57,655
- Climb onto it.
- I'm scared.

554
00:36:57,715 --> 00:36:59,956
Don't go too fast and fucking
break yourself.

555
00:37:26,644 --> 00:37:28,214
- Was that sweet?
- My hand is burnt.

556
00:37:28,279 --> 00:37:29,349
May I see?

557
00:37:29,413 --> 00:37:30,824
Yeah, I picked it up
by that black thing,

558
00:37:30,881 --> 00:37:33,361
I guess it was like hot
and I burnt my hand.

559
00:37:33,417 --> 00:37:34,794
My whole hand is burned,
literally.

560
00:37:34,852 --> 00:37:36,763
Well, well,
keep the ice on it.

561
00:37:36,821 --> 00:37:39,131
We had a snake in our house.

562
00:37:39,190 --> 00:37:40,328
Huh?

563
00:37:40,391 --> 00:37:42,064
- We had a snake in our house.
- Where's it at?

564
00:37:42,126 --> 00:37:44,367
No, no, no, it--
it went in there but it--

565
00:37:44,428 --> 00:37:45,907
My dad got it out.

566
00:37:45,963 --> 00:37:47,874
What kind of snake
was it?

567
00:37:47,932 --> 00:37:49,673
I don't know,
I was scared of it, though.

568
00:37:55,706 --> 00:37:56,844
Where's your phone?

569
00:37:56,907 --> 00:37:58,580
Oh, I put it back here,
didn't I?

570
00:37:58,643 --> 00:38:00,316
I gave it
back to you, right?

571
00:38:00,378 --> 00:38:01,823
No, you better not have
lost my phone.

572
00:38:01,879 --> 00:38:03,984
No, dumb,
I gave it back to you.

573
00:38:04,048 --> 00:38:05,254
I gave it back to you.

574
00:38:05,316 --> 00:38:06,989
No, you didn't,
you took it from me.

575
00:38:07,051 --> 00:38:08,997
Move your arm.

576
00:38:09,053 --> 00:38:10,589
You think I'm messing around?

577
00:38:10,655 --> 00:38:12,965
It would've been behind me
and it's not.

578
00:38:13,024 --> 00:38:14,367
And don't throw the--

579
00:38:14,425 --> 00:38:16,735
I told you.

580
00:38:16,794 --> 00:38:18,273
I knew you had it.

581
00:38:50,628 --> 00:38:52,266
We already gave him this in--

582
00:38:52,330 --> 00:38:54,037
All four of you,
all four, uh--

583
00:38:54,098 --> 00:38:55,839
Hats, jewelry put away,
everything put away.

584
00:38:55,900 --> 00:38:57,504
- Take your hats off.
- Much obliged.

585
00:39:19,623 --> 00:39:21,694
Come back to us, Red.

586
00:39:34,672 --> 00:39:36,151
Ahh!

587
00:39:36,207 --> 00:39:37,311
Whoa!

588
00:39:37,375 --> 00:39:39,082
You had it,
but you dropped it.

589
00:39:41,178 --> 00:39:42,589
Catch it.

590
00:39:45,583 --> 00:39:47,221
Give me that ball.

591
00:39:50,621 --> 00:39:53,261
Go away.

592
00:39:53,324 --> 00:39:56,203
Press some buttons.

593
00:39:56,260 --> 00:39:58,536
We're not fucking here.

594
00:39:58,596 --> 00:40:00,098
So Vinnie all out, or...?

595
00:40:00,164 --> 00:40:02,075
Well, you guys gotta
get used to it

596
00:40:02,133 --> 00:40:03,806
if you're gonna
be taking our kids

597
00:40:03,868 --> 00:40:05,472
and we're gonna be
taking your kids.

598
00:40:08,706 --> 00:40:11,243
- You hung up on her?
- Yep.

599
00:40:11,308 --> 00:40:13,151
What was she doing?
What did she say?

600
00:40:16,113 --> 00:40:17,751
No Vinnie.

601
00:40:17,815 --> 00:40:19,726
- Why?
- Can't handle them.

602
00:40:19,784 --> 00:40:20,990
Well, you know?

603
00:40:21,051 --> 00:40:22,792
Well, we can't handle your
fucking kids.

604
00:40:22,853 --> 00:40:26,665
You know the girls did not
want him over there, period.

605
00:40:26,724 --> 00:40:29,898
It's like mouthwash, huh?

606
00:40:29,960 --> 00:40:31,405
That's a nice expression.

607
00:40:31,462 --> 00:40:33,442
You can do it,
you can do it, Dad!

608
00:40:33,497 --> 00:40:36,000
- You know I can!
- Calm down.

609
00:40:36,066 --> 00:40:39,343
You know, well, if that's
something you wanted to do...

610
00:40:39,403 --> 00:40:43,044
Benny, fuck him up--
how he get them...

611
00:40:43,107 --> 00:40:44,552
I beat his butt!

612
00:40:47,311 --> 00:40:49,757
- He's good at something.
- I'm good at this game.

613
00:40:49,814 --> 00:40:51,418
You are very good.

614
00:40:51,482 --> 00:40:53,257
Okay, press--
press start again.

615
00:40:53,317 --> 00:40:54,625
Kick his ass again.

616
00:40:54,685 --> 00:40:57,791
Okay, I'm first.

617
00:40:57,855 --> 00:40:59,129
I'm second,
he's third.

618
00:40:59,190 --> 00:41:01,101
Everybody be quiet,
shut the hell up.

619
00:41:05,129 --> 00:41:07,109
Four.

620
00:41:07,164 --> 00:41:09,906
No...

621
00:41:09,967 --> 00:41:12,413
Babe, Steve, babe,
what the hell?

622
00:41:12,470 --> 00:41:14,211
If you want to hurt the people
that love you,

623
00:41:14,271 --> 00:41:15,807
you're only gonna
hurt yourself.

624
00:41:15,873 --> 00:41:17,750
If you're not gonna play
right and play by the rules,

625
00:41:17,808 --> 00:41:19,412
then you can't play.

626
00:41:19,477 --> 00:41:21,354
- Yeah, baby.
- You can't play right.

627
00:41:21,412 --> 00:41:24,052
I bet you you can't roll
a quarter off your nose.

628
00:41:24,114 --> 00:41:26,993
You can't suck my dick
until I cum.

629
00:41:27,051 --> 00:41:29,258
I'll bet you can't roll
a quarter off your nose.

630
00:41:34,692 --> 00:41:35,966
Whoopsie.

631
00:41:39,997 --> 00:41:41,533
Fuck this.

632
00:41:41,599 --> 00:41:43,670
That was nothing.

633
00:41:43,734 --> 00:41:45,907
Whoa, are you okay?

634
00:41:45,970 --> 00:41:47,972
Babe, look.

635
00:41:48,038 --> 00:41:50,279
Well, did that hurt you,
really?

636
00:41:50,341 --> 00:41:51,945
Yeah, he's fucked up,
he's bleeding.

637
00:41:52,009 --> 00:41:54,785
He's got a laceration,
he needs-- he needs towels.

638
00:41:54,845 --> 00:41:57,382
- He is fine, dumb-ass.
- Shut up.

639
00:41:57,448 --> 00:41:59,359
Don't you talk to me
that way!

640
00:41:59,416 --> 00:42:01,396
He's fucking bleeding.

641
00:42:01,452 --> 00:42:04,524
I just wanna be beat up so bad
that I'm bleeding

642
00:42:04,588 --> 00:42:07,831
and my lips are swollen
and my eyes are--

643
00:42:07,892 --> 00:42:08,927
Why?

644
00:42:08,993 --> 00:42:10,472
I just wanna get
beat the fuck up.

645
00:42:10,528 --> 00:42:12,735
- Why ?
- Because I like it.

646
00:42:12,796 --> 00:42:14,070
Why?

647
00:42:14,131 --> 00:42:16,338
Because my family shouldn't have
been put through

648
00:42:16,400 --> 00:42:18,107
what I put 'em through.

649
00:42:18,168 --> 00:42:20,705
- And it's your fault?
- Yes.

650
00:42:20,771 --> 00:42:23,081
I never blamed you,
nobody's ever blamed you.

651
00:42:23,140 --> 00:42:24,676
You're blaming yourself.

652
00:42:24,742 --> 00:42:27,154
- It's not your fault.
- It is.

653
00:42:30,014 --> 00:42:34,258
I tried to do what I could,
and I let shit go, yes.

654
00:42:34,318 --> 00:42:38,061
But I was learning,
and you know what?

655
00:42:38,122 --> 00:42:39,658
I have a dirty house.

656
00:42:41,492 --> 00:42:42,766
I know.

657
00:42:42,826 --> 00:42:45,136
But I've been through
shit that you will never,

658
00:42:45,195 --> 00:42:47,505
ever, ever, ever be through.

659
00:43:29,306 --> 00:43:31,752
I tried to
go to the military,

660
00:43:31,809 --> 00:43:33,220
but they wouldn't take me

661
00:43:33,277 --> 00:43:35,154
because I didn't graduate
high school.

662
00:43:35,212 --> 00:43:38,557
So we built our own camp.

663
00:43:38,616 --> 00:43:42,655
They're making us look like
we were pieces of shit.

664
00:43:42,720 --> 00:43:44,722
But we were never
ever pieces of shit.

665
00:43:46,957 --> 00:43:50,029
Every bunker, every
fucking foxhole,

666
00:43:50,094 --> 00:43:51,767
you know we
did that for fun,

667
00:43:51,829 --> 00:43:53,035
it keeps you busy.

668
00:43:53,097 --> 00:43:55,941
Not because we were building
a fucking militia.

669
00:44:02,106 --> 00:44:03,847
I'm screwed now.

670
00:44:03,907 --> 00:44:07,650
I can't get a good job
because I'm a felon.

671
00:44:07,711 --> 00:44:09,952
I would've took the whole
fucking rap.

672
00:44:10,014 --> 00:44:11,425
My wife shouldn't
have been in there.

673
00:44:11,482 --> 00:44:13,359
She didn't even know some
of the shit I had.

674
00:44:16,887 --> 00:44:19,731
Oh, Mikey, Mikey.

675
00:44:53,657 --> 00:44:55,000
How were you born?

676
00:44:57,027 --> 00:45:01,737
Well, when two people really,
really love each other,

677
00:45:01,799 --> 00:45:04,803
they have sex.

678
00:45:04,868 --> 00:45:06,814
Do you know what it means?

679
00:45:06,870 --> 00:45:08,349
No.

680
00:45:08,405 --> 00:45:12,410
You know it means something
but you don't know what.

681
00:45:12,476 --> 00:45:17,221
Me and your Dad met
when we were real young.

682
00:45:17,281 --> 00:45:19,659
I was 13...

683
00:45:19,717 --> 00:45:23,130
when I met your father.

684
00:45:23,187 --> 00:45:26,191
And I didn't graduate.

685
00:45:28,826 --> 00:45:31,534
- You still didn't?
- No.

686
00:45:31,595 --> 00:45:33,575
You see, that's another thing
I didn't wanna tell you,

687
00:45:33,630 --> 00:45:37,043
'cause when I got
pregnant with you,

688
00:45:37,101 --> 00:45:39,980
I was 15.

689
00:45:40,037 --> 00:45:42,608
I finally know what age
you were.

690
00:45:42,673 --> 00:45:46,052
I know, you've been asking and
I've been telling you different.

691
00:45:46,110 --> 00:45:47,714
But that was only
for one reason.

692
00:45:47,778 --> 00:45:50,054
You were saying 17, 18, 19...

693
00:45:50,114 --> 00:45:52,321
- Mm-hmm.
- 51.

694
00:45:52,382 --> 00:45:54,988
But you know why
I told you that?

695
00:45:55,052 --> 00:45:56,258
Mm-hmm.

696
00:45:56,320 --> 00:45:57,697
I just didn't
want you to think,

697
00:45:57,755 --> 00:46:00,793
"Oh, well, Mom got pregnant
when she was 15,

698
00:46:00,858 --> 00:46:03,896
so I'll get pregnant
while I'm 15."

699
00:46:03,961 --> 00:46:05,031
Mm-mm.

700
00:46:05,095 --> 00:46:06,972
Because I don't want you
to end up like that.

701
00:46:07,030 --> 00:46:08,771
Not that I would change it.

702
00:46:08,832 --> 00:46:11,278
I love you guys and I wouldn't
change a thing.

703
00:46:11,335 --> 00:46:13,440
And I love your father.

704
00:46:13,504 --> 00:46:17,884
But if I had a choice,

705
00:46:17,941 --> 00:46:21,445
and I could still have the same
three children and everything,

706
00:46:21,512 --> 00:46:24,288
I might have waited
a little bit longer.

707
00:46:24,348 --> 00:46:25,691
You know what I mean?

708
00:47:04,822 --> 00:47:06,130
I know, I'm getting
my grades up.

709
00:47:06,190 --> 00:47:07,635
I'm doing what I gotta do.

710
00:47:16,834 --> 00:47:18,040
All right.

711
00:47:20,270 --> 00:47:21,647
Yeah.

712
00:47:26,443 --> 00:47:27,717
I'll get it.

713
00:47:46,496 --> 00:47:49,602
I've got something
serious to tell you.

714
00:47:49,666 --> 00:47:52,579
I was in jail for 100 years.

715
00:47:52,636 --> 00:47:55,480
Even Mom was in jail, too.

716
00:47:55,539 --> 00:47:58,782
Me and Michael
get ripped apart.

717
00:47:58,842 --> 00:48:02,312
And I'd be alone with
someone else.

718
00:48:02,379 --> 00:48:05,189
But Sarah wasn't even there.

719
00:48:05,249 --> 00:48:07,991
There was no TV,
no cereal, no food.

720
00:48:08,051 --> 00:48:11,498
There was no chairs,
no beds, no house.

721
00:48:11,555 --> 00:48:13,967
No anything.

722
00:48:14,024 --> 00:48:18,200
We had to sleep on the ground
where scorpions are.

723
00:48:18,262 --> 00:48:20,435
Bad people are in there.

724
00:48:20,497 --> 00:48:22,602
They kill kids.

725
00:48:22,666 --> 00:48:25,340
There was a rope tied up
on the wood.

726
00:48:25,402 --> 00:48:26,540
They put--

727
00:48:26,603 --> 00:48:29,345
They made a little hole,

728
00:48:29,406 --> 00:48:34,617
they put on your head
right here.

729
00:48:34,678 --> 00:48:38,785
And they tell you,
"Jump off,"

730
00:48:38,849 --> 00:48:41,261
and you'll die.

731
00:48:41,318 --> 00:48:44,822
And you can't breathe, either,
if you do that.

732
00:48:44,888 --> 00:48:46,094
I didn't even die.

733
00:48:46,156 --> 00:48:47,999
They didn't even kill me.

734
00:48:51,728 --> 00:48:56,837
Michael, is that a big old
blue wave coming at us?

735
00:48:56,900 --> 00:48:58,880
See that blue stuff?

736
00:49:02,406 --> 00:49:04,408
- What was that?
- A stick.

737
00:49:04,474 --> 00:49:06,044
You finished your
ice cream already?

738
00:49:06,109 --> 00:49:07,588
- Yeah.
- No.

739
00:49:11,081 --> 00:49:13,618
You're gonna kill
all the fish.

740
00:49:13,684 --> 00:49:16,130
I hope that
fish doesn't die.

741
00:49:16,186 --> 00:49:17,597
I think I caught something.

742
00:49:23,627 --> 00:49:26,699
Can I go in the water?

743
00:49:26,763 --> 00:49:29,300
You didn't ask Mom.

744
00:49:29,366 --> 00:49:33,246
Dang it,
I wanna go swimming.

745
00:49:33,303 --> 00:49:34,839
So I can be happy.

746
00:50:16,713 --> 00:50:21,594
He put his keys in the door,
and then he must've fallen.

747
00:50:21,651 --> 00:50:23,892
We found the first mark
right here,

748
00:50:23,954 --> 00:50:25,729
'cause this is
where he hurt his head.

749
00:50:25,789 --> 00:50:29,896
This area, the ashtray was down,
the ashes were here.

750
00:50:29,960 --> 00:50:32,873
From there
he crawled to the chair,

751
00:50:32,929 --> 00:50:36,877
pulled himself into the chair
and bent over like this

752
00:50:36,933 --> 00:50:38,742
and that's how we found him.

753
00:51:58,115 --> 00:52:04,361
# If today was a knotty
crooked highway #

754
00:52:04,421 --> 00:52:10,030
# If tonight was
a knotty crooked tree #

755
00:52:10,093 --> 00:52:15,406
# If tomorrow wasn't
such a long time #

756
00:52:15,465 --> 00:52:21,381
# And lonesome would mean
nothing to you at all #

757
00:52:21,438 --> 00:52:26,979
# Yes and only if
my one true love is waiting #

758
00:52:27,043 --> 00:52:31,685
# If I could hear her heart
softly pounding #

759
00:52:31,748 --> 00:52:37,221
# Yes and only if
she was lying by me #

760
00:52:37,287 --> 00:52:44,068
# I'd lie in my bed once again #

761
00:52:47,931 --> 00:52:54,041
# Yes and only if my one true
love is waiting #

762
00:52:54,104 --> 00:52:59,019
# If I could only hear
her heart is softly pounding #

763
00:52:59,075 --> 00:53:03,922
# Yes and only if she was
lying by me #

764
00:53:03,980 --> 00:53:09,987
# And I'd lie
in my bed once again ##

765
00:53:18,228 --> 00:53:21,505
Is one of the side effects
from the Resveratrol,

766
00:53:21,565 --> 00:53:23,806
does it cause, like,
sleeplessness?

767
00:53:23,867 --> 00:53:26,438
- Not sleeplessness--
- No? It keeps you up?

768
00:53:26,503 --> 00:53:28,813
Not keeps-- keeps you up.

769
00:53:28,872 --> 00:53:31,113
- It makes drowsy.
- Okay, makes drowsy, okay.

770
00:53:31,174 --> 00:53:33,552
'Cause he's just been getting
like black circles

771
00:53:33,610 --> 00:53:35,248
around his eyes and stuff.

772
00:53:35,312 --> 00:53:37,292
- Not getting any sleep?
- Yeah.

773
00:53:39,649 --> 00:53:42,095
Why's your face
got chocolate on it?

774
00:53:42,152 --> 00:53:44,655
I think that he's taking, uh,
Ritalin too, right?

775
00:53:44,721 --> 00:53:45,859
Yeah.

776
00:53:45,922 --> 00:53:47,697
- That's causes, yeah.
- That's-- Okay.

777
00:53:47,757 --> 00:53:49,327
That's keeping him awake.

778
00:53:49,392 --> 00:53:51,235
So we went to the doctor and we
had his medicine changed

779
00:53:51,294 --> 00:53:53,467
and he changed him to Lithium.

780
00:53:53,530 --> 00:53:55,510
I know that Lithium
is for bipolar,

781
00:53:55,565 --> 00:53:57,704
but I don't know
all the side effects,

782
00:53:57,767 --> 00:54:00,179
or what its-- really does.

783
00:54:00,237 --> 00:54:02,581
I wasn't really
explained that.

784
00:54:02,639 --> 00:54:05,620
Well, after two weeks,
I was told to up the dose,

785
00:54:05,675 --> 00:54:08,053
so that's 600 milligrams
a day.

786
00:54:08,111 --> 00:54:10,091
And then on the third day,

787
00:54:10,146 --> 00:54:12,217
he went to get a drink
from the fridge.

788
00:54:12,282 --> 00:54:15,593
His hand was shaking real bad,
and he dropped his drink.

789
00:54:15,652 --> 00:54:18,895
I asked him if he was okay, but
he couldn't get the words out.

790
00:54:18,955 --> 00:54:20,992
They were broken words.

791
00:54:21,057 --> 00:54:23,560
There's no hospital in Bombay
Beach, there's no doctor.

792
00:54:23,627 --> 00:54:25,368
There's nothing.

793
00:54:25,428 --> 00:54:27,840
I had to carry him
because he couldn't walk.

794
00:54:27,897 --> 00:54:30,810
And he just had one really big
rapid movement

795
00:54:30,867 --> 00:54:33,279
and he hit his
head on the sink.

796
00:54:33,336 --> 00:54:35,077
It was just really,
really scary.

797
00:54:35,138 --> 00:54:36,811
I was terrified.

798
00:54:36,873 --> 00:54:39,945
- Hello, Benjamin, how are you?
- Hi.

799
00:54:43,613 --> 00:54:48,392
Is he, um, fine?
No more episodes?

800
00:54:48,451 --> 00:54:51,057
I haven't noticed any.

801
00:54:51,121 --> 00:54:52,794
But he's still taking
the Lithium,

802
00:54:52,856 --> 00:54:55,894
the one I think
gave him the seizure.

803
00:54:55,959 --> 00:54:58,565
Or, if it was a seizure,
I don't know if it was.

804
00:54:58,628 --> 00:55:00,835
Well, I have good news,
okay?

805
00:55:00,897 --> 00:55:02,899
The EEG is completely normal.

806
00:55:02,966 --> 00:55:04,138
Okay--

807
00:55:04,200 --> 00:55:05,941
The CAT Scan
is completely normal.

808
00:55:06,002 --> 00:55:07,538
Really, oh.

809
00:55:07,604 --> 00:55:10,517
So, he's clear neurologically
for now.

810
00:55:10,573 --> 00:55:14,578
- Okay.
- Until a next episode comes.

811
00:55:14,644 --> 00:55:17,955
What should I do if
that happens again?

812
00:55:18,014 --> 00:55:20,585
Because we live in
Bombay Beach, 'cause--

813
00:55:20,650 --> 00:55:24,154
How far is the next town with
a hospital, with a doctor?

814
00:55:24,220 --> 00:55:26,723
Um, that would be Brawley.

815
00:55:26,790 --> 00:55:30,135
And that would be
maybe an hour.

816
00:55:30,193 --> 00:55:32,639
- To Pioneers Hospital?
- Yeah, to Pioneers.

817
00:55:32,696 --> 00:55:34,869
Well, if he has another episode
you have to--

818
00:55:34,931 --> 00:55:36,137
Just take him?

819
00:55:36,199 --> 00:55:37,974
Immediately bring him
to Pioneers.

820
00:55:38,034 --> 00:55:40,071
Should he continue
that medicine?

821
00:55:40,136 --> 00:55:41,706
- Which one?
- The Lithium.

822
00:55:41,771 --> 00:55:43,751
Well, you'd have to ask the...

823
00:55:43,807 --> 00:55:46,253
- The other doctor.
- Right, okay.

824
00:55:46,309 --> 00:55:49,381
I am just clearing him
neurologically.

825
00:55:49,446 --> 00:55:53,758
So it probably was a reaction
to the medication, probably.

826
00:55:53,817 --> 00:55:54,921
Okay.

827
00:55:54,984 --> 00:55:56,759
But neurologically,
he's clear.

828
00:55:56,820 --> 00:56:00,495
So he has to continue with
his behavioral medications

829
00:56:00,557 --> 00:56:01,968
and doctors, okay?

830
00:56:02,025 --> 00:56:03,732
All right.

831
00:56:03,793 --> 00:56:05,329
Nice meeting you, okay?

832
00:57:01,885 --> 00:57:04,058
What did you do to me,
Jessie?

833
00:57:04,120 --> 00:57:05,963
Give 'em the
pictures, I don't care.

834
00:57:06,022 --> 00:57:07,330
- Yeah, you do.
- No, I don't.

835
00:57:07,390 --> 00:57:08,994
Brentley, you're over here
threatening me,

836
00:57:09,058 --> 00:57:10,560
blackmailing me,
I don't care anymore.

837
00:57:17,434 --> 00:57:19,277
Go show those pictures,
I don't care.

838
00:57:31,815 --> 00:57:34,193
We broke up
like almost a month ago.

839
00:57:34,250 --> 00:57:35,957
And he's just trying to
blackmail me

840
00:57:36,019 --> 00:57:37,191
- to get back with him.
- I know.

841
00:57:37,253 --> 00:57:41,224
'Cause he has pictures of me
doing oral to him.

842
00:57:41,291 --> 00:57:44,465
Yeah, I know, but I'm scared.

843
00:57:44,527 --> 00:57:46,165
Yes, I know.

844
00:57:46,229 --> 00:57:47,640
It's my fault, I know.

845
00:57:47,697 --> 00:57:48,937
How many times
did I tell you?

846
00:57:48,998 --> 00:57:50,341
A lot.

847
00:58:17,794 --> 00:58:20,240
Oh.

848
00:58:20,296 --> 00:58:22,037
You was blinding me.

849
00:58:22,098 --> 00:58:23,372
I'm sorry.

850
00:58:28,705 --> 00:58:31,709
- What are those for?
- Magician career.

851
00:58:31,774 --> 00:58:33,447
Well, why a white mask?

852
00:58:33,510 --> 00:58:34,989
I think it looks exotic.

853
00:58:35,044 --> 00:58:37,024
Like everybody-- everybody's
face is the same.

854
00:58:37,080 --> 00:58:38,423
That looks creepy.

855
00:58:38,481 --> 00:58:40,188
But I mean, like,
then you guys can't see

856
00:58:40,250 --> 00:58:41,820
- your facial expressions.
- That's the point.

857
00:58:41,885 --> 00:58:43,694
Like everybody just looks like
stiff, but like--

858
00:58:43,753 --> 00:58:45,255
- I know.
- Like everybody looks stiff,

859
00:58:45,321 --> 00:58:47,096
but like the movements are like
crazy and how you hit it.

860
00:58:47,156 --> 00:58:49,261
But I like,
like, seeing your face.

861
00:58:57,767 --> 00:58:59,678
- Can you see my eyes?
- Oh, yeah.

862
00:59:09,646 --> 00:59:12,718
# Well it's been a long time #

863
00:59:12,782 --> 00:59:16,628
# Long time now #

864
00:59:16,686 --> 00:59:23,934
# Since I've seen you smile #

865
00:59:23,993 --> 00:59:31,241
# And I'll gamble away
my fright #

866
00:59:31,301 --> 00:59:38,480
# And I'll gamble
away my time #

867
00:59:38,541 --> 00:59:45,857
# And in a year
a year or so #

868
00:59:45,915 --> 00:59:53,094
# This will slip into the sea #

869
00:59:53,156 --> 01:00:00,301
# Well it's been a long time
long time now #

870
01:00:00,363 --> 01:00:07,076
# Since I've seen you smile ##

871
01:01:04,661 --> 01:01:06,663
I get up each day.

872
01:01:06,729 --> 01:01:10,438
I make it out to the road to
pick up the newspaper.

873
01:01:10,500 --> 01:01:13,003
Bring it in for Les and Didi.

874
01:01:13,069 --> 01:01:16,016
Trying to more or less
take care of myself,

875
01:01:16,072 --> 01:01:19,349
yet gain the exercise and all.

876
01:01:23,680 --> 01:01:26,991
I gain a little bit
every day.

877
01:01:27,050 --> 01:01:30,998
But I still wake up at night

878
01:01:31,054 --> 01:01:35,332
thinking I hear somebody out
here trying to steal something.

879
01:01:35,391 --> 01:01:38,861
I don't know, it just gets to be
a habit, I guess.

880
01:01:38,928 --> 01:01:41,067
Life is nothing
but a habit, anyway.

881
01:01:44,500 --> 01:01:46,104
Benny.

882
01:01:50,306 --> 01:01:51,478
Benny.

883
01:01:54,377 --> 01:01:55,947
Wake up.

884
01:01:56,012 --> 01:01:58,492
Wake up.

885
01:01:58,548 --> 01:02:01,392
It's your first day of school.

886
01:02:01,451 --> 01:02:03,431
Look, what is that?

887
01:02:03,486 --> 01:02:04,624
Rascal.

888
01:02:04,687 --> 01:02:07,065
- Oohh.
- Oh, isn't he cute?

889
01:02:09,726 --> 01:02:12,502
- It's gonna suck.
- Why?

890
01:02:12,562 --> 01:02:14,633
Because I don't wanna be alone.

891
01:02:14,697 --> 01:02:17,906
You won't be alone,
you'll have friends.

892
01:02:17,967 --> 01:02:21,073
I wonder if
they'll be nice to me.

893
01:02:21,137 --> 01:02:23,174
If you'll be nice to them,
I'm sure they will be.

894
01:02:27,443 --> 01:02:29,116
Oop.

895
01:02:29,178 --> 01:02:31,180
It don't wanna button.

896
01:02:31,247 --> 01:02:33,955
What in the world?

897
01:02:34,016 --> 01:02:35,723
I want that one.

898
01:02:35,785 --> 01:02:37,423
Ooh.

899
01:02:37,487 --> 01:02:41,264
All the girlies are gonna be
like, "woo-hoo."

900
01:02:41,324 --> 01:02:43,998
Rub 'em together.

901
01:02:44,060 --> 01:02:45,664
All over your face.

902
01:02:45,728 --> 01:02:47,730
Ahh.

903
01:02:47,797 --> 01:02:49,970
Smells good.

904
01:02:50,032 --> 01:02:51,534
Open your mouth.

905
01:02:54,604 --> 01:02:56,049
Okay, now open.

906
01:02:59,408 --> 01:03:02,082
Don't spill it
on your shirt.

907
01:03:02,145 --> 01:03:03,886
Here comes the sexy boy.

908
01:03:03,946 --> 01:03:05,926
Well, hello, Mr. Boy.

909
01:03:08,284 --> 01:03:10,264
- You gonna be good today?
- Yeah.

910
01:03:10,319 --> 01:03:13,095
I'm gonna take my wallet
so they know who I am.

911
01:03:13,156 --> 01:03:14,931
Oh, they know who you are.

912
01:03:14,991 --> 01:03:16,868
Yeah.

913
01:03:16,926 --> 01:03:18,963
But you're gonna show 'em
a new Benny, aren't you?

914
01:03:19,028 --> 01:03:23,602
- Mm-hmm, I am.
- A new and improved Benny.

915
01:03:23,666 --> 01:03:27,113
- So, are you okay?
- I hope so.

916
01:03:27,170 --> 01:03:29,207
You'll be okay.

917
01:03:29,272 --> 01:03:30,842
Did you say you hope so?

918
01:03:30,907 --> 01:03:32,750
I hope I behave.

919
01:03:43,286 --> 01:03:44,788
Okay?

920
01:03:50,960 --> 01:03:54,134
I gotta talk to 'em
because there's like

921
01:03:54,197 --> 01:03:57,178
the side effects
from the Resveratrol.

922
01:03:57,233 --> 01:03:58,974
Uh-huh, what is that?

923
01:03:59,035 --> 01:04:01,379
One of the major ones
is the drooling.

924
01:04:01,437 --> 01:04:05,681
There's also the little bugs,
he thinks there's bugs on him.

925
01:04:05,741 --> 01:04:08,085
These never go away.

926
01:04:08,144 --> 01:04:10,556
That is our point,
I was like, oh, my gosh.

927
01:04:10,613 --> 01:04:13,719
I hadn't really done any
research on Resveratrol.

928
01:04:13,783 --> 01:04:15,660
I saw you bringing
some stuff out.

929
01:04:15,718 --> 01:04:17,061
Yeah.

930
01:04:18,621 --> 01:04:20,225
Well, there's your classroom.

931
01:04:23,492 --> 01:04:25,369
Wow, I used to have
this class.

932
01:04:25,428 --> 01:04:29,774
I have a seat for you--
come here, come look.

933
01:04:29,832 --> 01:04:34,577
I put you right here, okay?

934
01:04:34,637 --> 01:04:35,707
Right here.

935
01:04:35,771 --> 01:04:37,250
Wow.

936
01:04:37,306 --> 01:04:39,684
And you have
all your new books.

937
01:04:39,742 --> 01:04:42,188
Hey, can I talk to you?

938
01:04:42,245 --> 01:04:44,851
I know that last year,
you got yelled at a lot.

939
01:04:44,914 --> 01:04:46,655
Is that correct?

940
01:04:46,716 --> 01:04:49,060
You don't want to get yelled at
anymore, do you?

941
01:04:49,118 --> 01:04:50,722
You want to get yelled at
or no, you don't wanna?

942
01:04:50,786 --> 01:04:52,390
- No.
- I didn't think so.

943
01:04:52,455 --> 01:04:55,368
So, um, how-- how--

944
01:04:55,424 --> 01:04:57,995
Do you think you can control
yourself this year?

945
01:04:58,060 --> 01:05:00,165
- I don't know.
- Well, I hope so.

946
01:05:00,229 --> 01:05:01,606
Can you try?

947
01:05:01,664 --> 01:05:02,802
So what happens?

948
01:05:02,865 --> 01:05:05,505
You start feeling mad inside
or what?

949
01:05:05,568 --> 01:05:08,640
Uh, I have a special
trick for backpacks.

950
01:05:08,704 --> 01:05:11,583
You need to go into the front
part of your desk

951
01:05:11,641 --> 01:05:15,453
and push the backpack
in from the front.

952
01:05:15,511 --> 01:05:17,787
Squish it, squish
it right through there.

953
01:05:17,847 --> 01:05:20,225
Squish, squish, squish.

954
01:05:20,283 --> 01:05:23,059
Your backpack will not fit
there, so that can go there.

955
01:05:32,194 --> 01:05:35,198
Okay, please stand.

956
01:05:35,264 --> 01:05:37,369
And do the flag salute.

957
01:05:37,433 --> 01:05:39,709
Okay, ready, begin.

958
01:05:39,769 --> 01:05:43,546
I pledge allegiance
to the flag

959
01:05:43,606 --> 01:05:47,179
of the United
States of America.

960
01:05:47,243 --> 01:05:51,055
And to the republic
for which it stands,

961
01:05:51,113 --> 01:05:55,391
one nation, under God,
indivisible,

962
01:05:55,451 --> 01:05:58,660
with liberty
and justice for all.

963
01:06:04,126 --> 01:06:07,073
Let's go, Hornets!

964
01:06:07,129 --> 01:06:10,201
Let's go, Hornets!

965
01:06:10,266 --> 01:06:13,213
Let's go, Hornets!

966
01:06:13,269 --> 01:06:16,478
Let's go, Hornets!

967
01:06:16,539 --> 01:06:18,985
Catching the ball.

968
01:06:23,479 --> 01:06:25,789
CeeJay, go, go,
go, go, go!

969
01:06:32,922 --> 01:06:34,993
Come on, CeeJay!

970
01:06:41,497 --> 01:06:43,135
Cedric, good job!

971
01:07:19,068 --> 01:07:22,447
# Well don't you make
that sad mistake #

972
01:07:22,505 --> 01:07:25,611
# You know that I'm
talking 'bout a birthday cake #

973
01:07:25,674 --> 01:07:27,176
# Get your finger
out of it #

974
01:07:27,243 --> 01:07:31,282
# It don't belong to you #

975
01:07:31,347 --> 01:07:35,227
# I wouldn't give you a piece
even if you want me to ##

976
01:08:00,810 --> 01:08:02,790
- This ain't a beach.
- Yeah, it is.

977
01:08:06,048 --> 01:08:09,723
Benny, I've got something
important to tell you.

978
01:08:09,785 --> 01:08:11,264
And what is that?

979
01:08:11,320 --> 01:08:12,856
I have a baby in my tummy.

980
01:08:12,922 --> 01:08:14,868
You're going to be
a big brother.

981
01:08:14,924 --> 01:08:16,801
And why do you
need to be pregnant?

982
01:08:16,859 --> 01:08:19,703
There is three kids
already.

983
01:08:19,762 --> 01:08:22,800
- I wish this was my house.
- Why?

984
01:08:22,865 --> 01:08:24,708
'Cause it's a big room.

985
01:08:29,972 --> 01:08:31,747
This is the day
the Lord has made.

986
01:08:31,807 --> 01:08:34,287
Let's rejoice and be glad it--

987
01:08:34,343 --> 01:08:37,256
Wrong phone.

988
01:08:37,313 --> 01:08:39,122
Bombay Market,
good afternoon.

989
01:08:51,527 --> 01:08:54,064
There's a plate in there.

990
01:08:54,130 --> 01:08:56,667
- What do you want?
- Gold.

991
01:09:35,204 --> 01:09:38,583
# Happy birthday
to Michael #

992
01:09:38,641 --> 01:09:42,919
# Happy birthday to you ##

993
01:09:59,395 --> 01:10:02,308
I believe we got a Red
coming, yes.

994
01:10:02,364 --> 01:10:03,934
Red's here.

995
01:10:03,999 --> 01:10:05,774
Good to see you,
you look really good.

996
01:10:05,834 --> 01:10:08,212
Well, I am good, even better
than you might think.

997
01:10:08,270 --> 01:10:09,510
How you doing, Scooter?

998
01:10:09,572 --> 01:10:10,915
Pretty good,
how you doing?

999
01:10:10,973 --> 01:10:12,111
Real good.

1000
01:10:12,174 --> 01:10:13,676
Can I get me one of them
cigarettes?

1001
01:10:13,742 --> 01:10:15,016
I'm going to jail
this morning.

1002
01:10:15,077 --> 01:10:16,055
Huh?

1003
01:10:16,111 --> 01:10:17,488
We told 'em we were going
on vacation.

1004
01:10:17,546 --> 01:10:19,184
In about a half an hour.

1005
01:10:19,248 --> 01:10:20,921
That Jerry's
little brother.

1006
01:10:20,983 --> 01:10:22,428
- Oh, Ben and Miranda--
- Ben, yeah.

1007
01:10:22,484 --> 01:10:24,122
They're actually
going to church, too.

1008
01:10:24,186 --> 01:10:26,496
You aren't talking about Big
Mary and Little Mary, are you?

1009
01:10:26,555 --> 01:10:27,625
No.

1010
01:10:27,690 --> 01:10:28,896
- Eskimo Patty?
- No.

1011
01:10:28,958 --> 01:10:30,995
What about Chris
that used to be out here?

1012
01:10:31,060 --> 01:10:33,939
- He's kind of a vegetable now.
- What happened to Half Pint?

1013
01:10:33,996 --> 01:10:36,237
And what about
old Scary Sherry?

1014
01:10:36,298 --> 01:10:37,834
Is she still around?

1015
01:10:37,900 --> 01:10:41,313
Wow, what about, uh...
No, I call her "Cow's Ass."

1016
01:10:41,370 --> 01:10:44,817
Up there... Sheila?

1017
01:10:44,873 --> 01:10:47,444
Red, who do you think
that looks like?

1018
01:10:47,509 --> 01:10:49,250
It's on TV?

1019
01:10:49,311 --> 01:10:51,120
Spaceship movies?

1020
01:10:51,180 --> 01:10:53,319
Hmm.

1021
01:10:53,382 --> 01:10:55,362
How 'bout "Star Wars"?

1022
01:10:55,417 --> 01:10:58,057
- How 'bout Yoda?
- Was that Yoda?

1023
01:10:58,120 --> 01:11:00,623
I thought they called that
"yogurt."

1024
01:11:00,689 --> 01:11:04,000
I'm back
and I'm happy about it.

1025
01:11:04,059 --> 01:11:07,700
And dang it, I'm a lucky cuss.

1026
01:11:07,763 --> 01:11:09,765
I told 'em when I was
down and out,

1027
01:11:09,832 --> 01:11:12,312
that I would get back there.

1028
01:11:12,368 --> 01:11:14,974
I still enjoy my cigarettes,

1029
01:11:15,037 --> 01:11:17,608
and I drink a bourbon
now and then.

1030
01:11:17,673 --> 01:11:20,244
I love my girlfriends.

1031
01:11:20,309 --> 01:11:22,311
I never say "goodbye."

1032
01:11:22,378 --> 01:11:24,153
I'll say so long to you.

1033
01:11:24,213 --> 01:11:25,556
Glad to know you.

1034
01:11:25,614 --> 01:11:27,525
Hope to see you again.

1035
01:11:27,583 --> 01:11:30,257
"Goodbye" is very definite.

1036
01:11:30,319 --> 01:11:32,356
And I don't believe in things
that definite

1037
01:11:32,421 --> 01:11:34,094
about something
you don't know.

1038
01:11:39,228 --> 01:11:42,937
It takes a whole community
to raise a child.

1039
01:11:42,998 --> 01:11:44,978
But you must remember,

1040
01:11:45,034 --> 01:11:49,983
some of the very best-raised
children do turn bad

1041
01:11:50,039 --> 01:11:51,916
because of
their inner thoughts.

1042
01:12:26,141 --> 01:12:28,621
# I was thinking #

1043
01:12:28,677 --> 01:12:33,353
# Of a series of dreams #

1044
01:12:33,415 --> 01:12:38,228
# Where nothing
comes up to the top #

1045
01:12:41,323 --> 01:12:43,997
# Everything #

1046
01:12:44,059 --> 01:12:48,701
# Stays down
but it's wounded #

1047
01:12:48,764 --> 01:12:53,304
# And come to a permanent stop #

1048
01:12:56,405 --> 01:13:01,377
# Wasn't thinking
of anything specific #

1049
01:13:03,545 --> 01:13:07,015
# Like in a dream when #

1050
01:13:07,082 --> 01:13:09,653
# Someone wakes up
and screams #

1051
01:13:12,087 --> 01:13:14,727
# Nothing #

1052
01:13:14,790 --> 01:13:16,633
# Too very scientific #

1053
01:13:19,495 --> 01:13:22,499
# Just thinking #

1054
01:13:22,564 --> 01:13:24,737
# Of a series of dreams #

1055
01:13:27,669 --> 01:13:31,674
# Dreams where
the umbrella is open #

1056
01:13:34,843 --> 01:13:39,849
# Into the path you
are hurled #

1057
01:13:42,217 --> 01:13:45,255
# And the cards are #

1058
01:13:45,320 --> 01:13:49,700
# No good that
you're holding #

1059
01:13:49,758 --> 01:13:52,830
# Unless they're #

1060
01:13:52,895 --> 01:13:55,034
# From another world ##

1061
01:16:17,072 --> 01:16:22,078
Bye-bye, bye-bye,
everyone, bye-bye !

1062
01:16:22,144 --> 01:16:25,717
I love Bombay Beach, bye-bye!
