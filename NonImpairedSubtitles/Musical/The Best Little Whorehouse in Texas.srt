but them boxer shorts don't.

324

But when I was gettin' me some

because they have a his 'n' hers
sexy department at Frederick's

Mmm. Little is the key word here.
They are real little.

331
00:18:23,769 --> 00:18:25,817
In fact, a guy could hurt
himself wearin' those things.

332
00:18:25,896 --> 00:18:27,523
I don't think so,
thank you very much.

333
00:18:27,815 --> 00:18:32,446
Ed Earl, I paid $20 for these, plus
postage. And I want you to wear it.

334

You know, you better check
that turkey of hers,

in there that's gonna

ED EARL: (CHUCKLES) No way.

I don't believe in matrimony.
It screws up a relationship.

00:24:43,023 --> 00:24:45,025
was at the back
knockin' on the screen door.

459
00:24:45,109 --> 00:24:47,949
She said she's in a real big hurry but
just dropped by to give you this.

460
00:24:52,199 --> 00:24:53,826
It's a Japanese slingshot.

461
00:24:57,079 --> 00:24:59,798
Well, look at that! At last!

462
00:24:59,873 --> 00:25:02,092
Okay, Rufus.
What's on your mind?

463
00:25:02,167 --> 00:25:03,339
Something that
could have serious

464
00:25:03,419 --> 00:25:05,012
implications to
the health of this town!

465
00:25:05,087 --> 00:25:06,805
Tell him, C.J.!
Just like you told me.

466
00:25:06,880 --> 00:25:09,240
Well, Sheriff, I have this friend
that works in a TV station

467
00:25:09,299 --> 00:25:10,346
down in Houston.

468
00:25:10,426 --> 00:25:12,679
He tipped me off
that Melvin P. Thorpe's

469
00:25:12,761 --> 00:25:15,184
plannin' an expose
on the Chicken Ranch.

470
00:25:15,597 --> 00:25:16,689
Who?

471
00:25:16,765 --> 00:25:18,108
Melvin P. Thorpe!

472
00:25:18,183 --> 00:25:19,730
He's that crazy
consumer advocate.

473
00:25:19,810 --> 00:25:21,983
Has a report on
the late night news.

474
00:25:22,354 --> 00:25:24,857
He's got a new show now,
a half hour once a week,

475
00:25:24,940 --> 00:25:27,238
<i>The Watchdog Report.</i>
It's <i>on tonight.</i>

476
00:25:27,359 --> 00:25:30,659
The Chicken Ranch on TV.
Now, come on, fellas.

477
00:25:31,947 --> 00:25:33,324
Television is a family medium.

478
00:25:33,407 --> 00:25:35,034
But he's a sensationalist,
Ed Earl.

479
00:25:35,117 --> 00:25:38,291
He shows up with his TV cameras every
time a consumer has a complaint.

480
00:25:38,620 --> 00:25:40,213
He's a menace to
the business community.

481
00:25:40,539 --> 00:25:43,258
He's that feller that put the
peanuts back in the chocolate bar.

482
00:25:44,918 --> 00:25:46,010
What?

483
00:25:46,086 --> 00:25:48,088
He made the makers of the
Peanut Delight candy bar

484
00:25:48,172 --> 00:25:50,391
admit that they put less peanuts

485
00:25:50,466 --> 00:25:52,093
in each bar than
they advertised.

486
00:25:52,176 --> 00:25:53,416
He made them change their ways.

487
00:25:54,261 --> 00:25:55,421
Sounds like a tough customer.

488
00:25:55,888 --> 00:25:57,368
He's got a lot of
influence out there.

489
00:25:57,765 --> 00:25:59,645
If he brings cameras out
to the Chicken Ranch...

490
00:25:59,725 --> 00:26:03,070
Come on, Rufus!
I'll make some phone calls.

491
00:26:04,271 --> 00:26:06,899
I got a little influence
around this state myself.

492
00:26:10,486 --> 00:26:13,035
Well, it's no use talkin'
to me about it, Sheriff!

493
00:26:13,363 --> 00:26:16,412
Melvin P. Thorpe is now the biggest
attraction at this station.

494
00:26:16,950 --> 00:26:21,171
High ratings. Lots of letters.
He doesn't listen to anybody.

495
00:26:21,663 --> 00:26:23,586
Hell, he wants to go national!

496
00:26:23,665 --> 00:26:26,043
Wants to be watchdog
for the whole U.S. of A.

497
00:26:26,335 --> 00:26:27,803
Love to help you, Ed Earl,

498
00:26:27,878 --> 00:26:30,238
but just like you don't want to
mess with the Chicken Ranch,

499
00:26:30,297 --> 00:26:32,299
I don't wanna ruffle
this old bird's feathers.

500
00:26:32,925 --> 00:26:35,974
Here in Houston, he's becomin'
a regular Texas attraction.

501
00:26:36,345 --> 00:26:38,268
Well, now, wait a minute,
Ed Earl.

502
00:26:38,347 --> 00:26:42,318
I'd tread easy on this one. Them
TV boys can be mighty powerful.

503
00:26:42,476 --> 00:26:44,649
And mighty useful,
if you get my meaning.

504
00:26:45,104 --> 00:26:46,105
Senator, roll call.

505
00:26:47,189 --> 00:26:48,782
Excuse me, Ed Earl. I gotta go.

506
00:26:48,857 --> 00:26:51,235
It's that damn
bilingual bullshit again.

507
00:26:51,360 --> 00:26:53,112
Let me give you
a word of advice from

508
00:26:53,237 --> 00:26:55,410
one elected official to another.

509
00:26:56,198 --> 00:26:58,166
Be careful of the box.

510
00:27:02,121 --> 00:27:04,215
Son of a bitch.
What the hell's going on?

511
00:27:04,289 --> 00:27:07,042
This goddam Melvin P. Thorpe's
got the whole state bamboozled.

512
00:27:07,126 --> 00:27:09,379
This is serious, Ed Earl.
You gotta do something.

513
00:27:10,045 --> 00:27:11,467
I intend to.

514
00:27:12,422 --> 00:27:15,471
Deputy Fred. I want you to hold
down the fort for a while.

515
00:27:15,717 --> 00:27:16,969
Me? Yeah, you.

516
00:27:17,052 --> 00:27:18,474
Where you goin'?

517
00:27:18,554 --> 00:27:19,726
I'm goin' to Houston.
I'm gonna take care

518
00:27:19,805 --> 00:27:21,307
of that little
pecker wood myself.

519
00:27:42,411 --> 00:27:44,413
This is it. Thank you.

520
00:27:45,998 --> 00:27:47,796
MELVIN: Come in.

521
00:27:51,170 --> 00:27:52,547
Mr Thorpe?

522
00:27:52,921 --> 00:27:53,968
I know you.

523
00:27:54,548 --> 00:27:55,595
You do?

524
00:27:55,924 --> 00:27:59,554
Sheriff Ed Earl Dodd. They told
me you were here. Come on in.

525
00:28:00,971 --> 00:28:02,598
I hope I'm not...

526
00:28:03,765 --> 00:28:05,017
Interrupting anything.

527
00:28:05,267 --> 00:28:07,144
Oh, please!
It's my pleasure, my honor.

528
00:28:07,227 --> 00:28:08,729
What brings you here to Houston?

529
00:28:08,812 --> 00:28:10,405
Sit down. Anywhere over here.

530
00:28:10,480 --> 00:28:12,903
I, uh... (CHUCKLES).
I'm gettin' dressed.

531
00:28:13,025 --> 00:28:15,778
Sit down.
I've got my TV show to do,

532
00:28:15,903 --> 00:28:17,450
and I'm runnin'
a bit behind time.

533
00:28:17,946 --> 00:28:19,948
ED EARL: It's your show I want
to talk to you about, Mr Thorpe.

534
00:28:20,032 --> 00:28:21,409
Oop. Melvin.

535
00:28:21,491 --> 00:28:22,492
Melvin.

536
00:28:22,784 --> 00:28:24,536
Please. You watch the show, Ed?

537
00:28:24,620 --> 00:28:25,792
Last week Well...

538
00:28:26,330 --> 00:28:28,674
was the best ratin' we ever had.

539
00:28:28,832 --> 00:28:32,006
The city planning commissioner
was drivin' a city car...

540
00:28:32,085 --> 00:28:33,587
Just hold that for me, will you?

541
00:28:34,963 --> 00:28:37,842
While he was on vacation.
Caught him dead to rights.

542
00:28:38,258 --> 00:28:40,181
That pitiful putz.
Would you just pull that up?

543
00:28:40,260 --> 00:28:42,228
What? Just pull that up.

544
00:28:43,847 --> 00:28:45,895
And we broke a 30 share.

545
00:28:45,974 --> 00:28:47,976
It's affectin' my pieces
on the late night news.

546
00:28:48,435 --> 00:28:51,359
Up, up, up. They just
love my little report.

547
00:28:53,815 --> 00:28:55,032
I hear you're very popular.

548
00:28:55,359 --> 00:29:00,866
The power of television, of public
exposure, is so great it scares me.

549
00:29:01,114 --> 00:29:03,617
I swear, I could get the
mayor's own children

550
00:29:03,700 --> 00:29:04,701
to throw rocks at him.

551
00:29:05,827 --> 00:29:07,500
Which show did
you like best, Ed?

552
00:29:09,248 --> 00:29:11,376
I think the one about the...

553
00:29:11,583 --> 00:29:12,623
Nuts in the chocolate bar.

554
00:29:12,668 --> 00:29:14,762
That's one of my favorites.

555
00:29:15,128 --> 00:29:18,302
"Threescore" means 60,
like the Bible says.

556
00:29:18,382 --> 00:29:21,477
So, if it says "60
nuts" on the wrapper,

557
00:29:21,551 --> 00:29:24,600
I wanna see 60 nuts inside.

558
00:29:24,680 --> 00:29:27,479
And I'm talkin' full nuts.
I'm not talkin' a half nut,

559
00:29:27,849 --> 00:29:29,851
or nut bits or nut chips.

560
00:29:31,728 --> 00:29:33,071
I'm talkin' a full nut.

561
00:29:37,359 --> 00:29:38,906
I can see that.

562
00:29:39,361 --> 00:29:43,616
Thank God we still live in
a society where anything

563
00:29:43,949 --> 00:29:46,793
that's phony or dishonest
can't stand the light of day.

564
00:29:47,577 --> 00:29:49,545
Sock. Beg your pardon?

565
00:29:49,621 --> 00:29:50,918
Uh, sock.

566
00:29:51,498 --> 00:29:53,091
Thank you. Yeah.

567
00:29:54,626 --> 00:29:58,005
Most corporations involved
in false advertisin'

568
00:29:58,630 --> 00:30:00,724
would just laugh at a $50 fine.

569
00:30:01,383 --> 00:30:03,431
But you show up
with your TV camera

570
00:30:03,760 --> 00:30:05,808
and give them
a little bad publicity

571
00:30:06,096 --> 00:30:10,067
and they shape up faster than goose
shit slides through a tin horn.

572
00:30:10,392 --> 00:30:11,644
(LAUGHS)

573
00:30:13,353 --> 00:30:14,855
(HUMMING)

574
00:30:15,022 --> 00:30:18,026
Well, Melvin, it's that bad publicity
I want to talk to you about.

575
00:30:18,275 --> 00:30:20,528
That could hurt people.
You take that report

576
00:30:20,610 --> 00:30:22,157
you're doin' on
the Chicken Ranch.

577
00:30:23,030 --> 00:30:24,782
That place is older
than rocks and water.

578
00:30:25,407 --> 00:30:28,160
I wouldn't be surprised if your
granddaddy took your daddy out there

579
00:30:28,243 --> 00:30:29,790
to learn about
the birds and the bees.

580
00:30:29,870 --> 00:30:33,625
(CHUCKLES) I'm from New Jersey.

581
00:30:34,082 --> 00:30:37,586
See, I moved to Houston six years ago.
(CHUCKLES)

582
00:30:37,794 --> 00:30:39,592
Texas suits my style.

583
00:30:41,131 --> 00:30:42,849
The point I'm tryin' to make is

584
00:30:42,924 --> 00:30:45,268
that every schoolboy in
the state knows about it.

585
00:30:46,011 --> 00:30:47,854
Most of the politicians
have slept there.

586
00:30:47,929 --> 00:30:50,057
And the mayor and the people of
my county that voted for me,

587
00:30:50,140 --> 00:30:51,767
they want to keep
things just the way they are.

588
00:30:51,933 --> 00:30:55,779
Hmm. You know something,
Sheriff, it just struck me.

589
00:30:56,188 --> 00:30:58,282
We are in the same profession.

590
00:30:58,357 --> 00:30:59,404
What's that?

591
00:30:59,483 --> 00:31:00,860
Law enforcement.

592
00:31:00,942 --> 00:31:03,786
I'm out there fightin' for the
rights of the public, just like you.

593
00:31:03,862 --> 00:31:06,490
Both of us are interested
in protectin' the public.

594
00:31:06,782 --> 00:31:10,252
You in the old way,
and me in the new.

595
00:31:10,911 --> 00:31:12,003
Uh-huh. The new?

596
00:31:12,079 --> 00:31:13,797
Television.

597
00:31:14,206 --> 00:31:16,504
I'm the electronic
bounty hunter.

598
00:31:16,583 --> 00:31:18,802
I use a camera, you use a gun.

599
00:31:19,044 --> 00:31:20,296
Yeah.

600
00:31:20,504 --> 00:31:21,847
Well, Melvin,
everybody'd be happy

601
00:31:21,922 --> 00:31:23,219
if you'd just drop
the whole thing.

602
00:31:23,298 --> 00:31:24,345
Ah.

603
00:31:24,800 --> 00:31:27,223
I mean, those ladies out there,

604
00:31:27,636 --> 00:31:29,604
they perform
a necessary function.

605
00:31:29,679 --> 00:31:30,726
I mean, right or wrong...

606
00:31:30,806 --> 00:31:32,308
Right or wrong
don't interest me!

607
00:31:32,933 --> 00:31:36,312
I'm no moralizer. I leave
all that to the preacher.

608
00:31:36,770 --> 00:31:38,317
Well, I'm glad.

609
00:31:38,939 --> 00:31:40,441
Anyway, the mayor was
thinkin' maybe

610
00:31:40,524 --> 00:31:41,867
you'd want a little
unnecessary publicity.

611
00:31:41,942 --> 00:31:45,913
(LAUGHS) Unnecessary publicity?
He's got me all wrong!

612
00:31:45,987 --> 00:31:49,617
I'm not one of those sensation
mongers out to boost his own ego!

613
00:31:49,741 --> 00:31:50,742

how they feel about

about official blindness,

Well, I never stayed
with one family long enough

923
00:46:21,821 --> 00:46:23,101
to become
anything in particular.

924
00:46:23,572 --> 00:46:26,041
But I read the Bible.
I believe in Jesus.

925
00:46:26,826 --> 00:46:28,578
I think Jesus was...

926
00:46:28,995 --> 00:46:30,747
Was a real good man.

927
00:46:30,871 --> 00:46:32,669
And he was a heck of a speaker.

928
00:46:33,291 --> 00:46:37,046
Yep. I knew a woman once
that had a vision of Jesus.

929
00:46:37,128 --> 00:46:40,678
He came right in her house, set
right down at the foot of her bed.

931

if that happened to me.

932

I'll tell you something, honey.

933

all hell's gonna break loose.

937
00:46:54,103 --> 00:46:55,400
But you know,
Jesus was really good

938
00:46:55,479 --> 00:46:57,231
to Mary Magdalene,
the fallen woman.

939
00:46:57,732 --> 00:46:59,700
He was always
bein' very sociable.

940
00:47:00,234 --> 00:47:03,955
He went to this big weddin'
once and they ran out of wine.

941
00:47:04,280 --> 00:47:06,282
You know what he did?
Turned the water into wine.

942
00:47:07,283 --> 00:47:09,911
Well, that's a man that knows
how to throw a party.

943
00:47:10,411 --> 00:47:12,539
Now, don't be sacrilegious.

944
00:47:12,872 --> 00:47:16,126
I'm not.
I'm not. He forgives me.

945
00:47:17,251 --> 00:47:18,753
He knows I was kiddin'.

946
00:47:18,878 --> 00:47:20,346
Yeah, I know he forgives you.

947

how God can forgive you,

948

and people can't.
Now why is that?

949
00:47:25,593 --> 00:47:29,814
Well, because people are not
very God-like, Mona.

00:53:32,793 --> 00:53:35,046
You may be right.
I got over a dozen

1077
00:53:35,129 --> 00:53:36,802
messages here from
outraged citizens,

1078
00:53:36,880 --> 00:53:39,429
tellin' me that we got a
whorehouse in Lanville County.

1079
00:53:39,800 --> 00:53:42,053
Only been one here
for about 150 years.

1080
00:53:42,136 --> 00:53:45,140
Ed Earl, now, you can set up speed
traps to catch the tourists.

1081
00:53:45,431 --> 00:53:48,731
You can look the other way when the
wrong kid swipes a car to go joyriding.

1082
00:53:49,435 --> 00:53:51,608
Hell, you can even let Miss
Mona run her place out there!

1083
00:53:51,687 --> 00:53:55,533
But there's one thing you can't do and
that's broadcast gutter talk on TV.

1084
00:53:55,733 --> 00:53:57,406
I didn't know they
was takin' pictures.

1085
00:53:57,568 --> 00:53:59,912
What did you figure
the cameras were for?

1086
00:54:00,154 --> 00:54:03,408
Damn it, C.J.!
You pious pissant.

1087
00:54:03,949 --> 00:54:07,044
I don't have one-tenth the trouble
from Miss Mon♪s that I have from you

1088
00:54:07,119 --> 00:54:10,498
for one of your all-night stag parties
over at the Legionnaire Hall.

1089
00:54:10,998 --> 00:54:12,466
That ain't fair, dang it!

1090
00:54:12,541 --> 00:54:13,588
There's just one thing to do.

1091
00:54:13,667 --> 00:54:15,089
And that's close
the place down before

1092
00:54:15,169 --> 00:54:16,421
we all go to hell
in a hand basket.

1093
00:54:16,503 --> 00:54:20,224
Close it down! She was just fine as
long as she was bringin' in the money

1094
00:54:20,299 --> 00:54:21,642
and makin' civic contributions,

1095
00:54:21,717 --> 00:54:24,561
but the moment her luck ran sour,
you want to run out on her.

1096
00:54:25,012 --> 00:54:27,731
Run out on her like
rats from a burnin' barn!

1097
00:54:28,098 --> 00:54:31,853
That's just it, Ed Earl.
Who's gonna put out that fire?

1098
00:54:31,977 --> 00:54:33,570
Look, if you won't
close her down, at least

1099
00:54:33,645 --> 00:54:35,325
tell her to lay low
for a couple of months!

1100
00:54:35,397 --> 00:54:38,321
Yeah, just until the heat
wears off a little bit.

1101
00:54:38,400 --> 00:54:40,323
Give it two months.
What's two months?

1102
00:54:41,069 --> 00:54:43,948
Nobody tells me how
to run my goddam job,

1103
00:54:44,031 --> 00:54:45,829
and nobody gives me advice!

1104
00:54:46,200 --> 00:54:50,671
I'll do things my own way. I'm
gonna make up my own damn mind!

1105
00:54:51,663 --> 00:54:53,586
Two months. What's two months?

1106
00:54:53,665 --> 00:54:55,918
Shut down for two months!

1107
00:54:56,460 --> 00:54:59,760
That is a hell of a lot
to ask somebody, Ed Earl.

1108
00:55:00,047 --> 00:55:01,469
And that's a hell
of a lot of overhead

1109
00:55:01,548 --> 00:55:03,801
to pay out when
cash ain't comin' in.

1110

ought to tell my girls?

1111
00:55:06,053 --> 00:55:07,771
Well, maybe it won't
be two months.

1112

The holidays are comin' up.

1113
00:55:09,389 --> 00:55:11,232
Maybe in a couple of weeks the
whole thing will blow over

1114
00:55:11,308 --> 00:55:12,605
and then you can let
your regular customers...

1115
00:55:12,684 --> 00:55:16,905
I warned you yesterday about losin'
your temper and carryin' on.

1116
00:55:17,147 --> 00:55:18,945
Last night you said
you was proud of me.

1117
00:55:19,107 --> 00:55:22,077
Last night I wasn't
on the 11:00 news!

1118
00:55:22,611 --> 00:55:25,785
Well, I didn't know that son of a bitch
was gonna make an idiot out of me.

1119
00:55:25,948 --> 00:55:28,042
I don't know anything about
that electronic bullshit!

1120
00:55:28,116 --> 00:55:29,959
How was I supposed to
handle that situation?

1121
00:55:30,452 --> 00:55:34,002
That's your job, Ed Earl. Ain't
that what they pay you for?

1122
00:55:34,164 --> 00:55:37,543
I know what my job is! Don't be
tellin' me what my goddamn job is!

1123
00:55:37,626 --> 00:55:40,095
I could close this place down
in a New York minute!

1124
00:55:40,712 --> 00:55:43,340
All I'm askin' for is for you
to give me a little cooperation

1125
00:55:43,423 --> 00:55:45,425
so I can get through
a difficult situation

1126
00:55:45,592 --> 00:55:47,344
with as little
trouble as possible!

1127
00:55:47,427 --> 00:55:50,556
Okay, okay, okay!
I'll shut it down.

1128
00:55:50,806 --> 00:55:51,807
You will?

1129
00:55:52,099 --> 00:55:54,272
What do you want,
a written contract?

1130
00:55:54,977 --> 00:55:56,069
You promise?

1131
00:55:56,436 --> 00:55:58,939
Ed Earl,
I am givin' you my word.

1132
00:56:03,694 --> 00:56:06,117
I'm sorry, Mona,
about the whole situation.

1133
00:56:06,989 --> 00:56:08,957
Don't feel sorry for me.

1134
00:56:09,825 --> 00:56:13,875
I started out poor, and I
worked my way up to outcast.

1135

askin' you to do is gonna

turn out to be
the best thing for both of us.

I just promised the sheriff

that we're gonna shut
down for two months.

1164
00:57:27,861 --> 00:57:30,364
What about the football game

I did promise.

You think if we just close the
doors to the regular customers,

1171
00:57:43,251 --> 00:57:45,800
just went on with the party as
planned, that'd be all right?

I'm sure it will, honey. That party

01:15:43,164 --> 01:15:44,211

1386
01:15:44,290 --> 01:15:46,042
The law!
You wanna talk about the law!

1387
01:15:46,125 --> 01:15:48,503
A bunch of crazies break into
my house tonight,

1388
01:15:48,669 --> 01:15:51,172
comin' in here, takin'
pictures, invadin' my privacy,

1389
01:15:51,255 --> 01:15:53,633
and you wanna know what
the law's gonna do about that?

1390
01:15:53,716 --> 01:15:54,968
I can tell you. Nothin'!

1391
01:15:55,051 --> 01:15:56,769

to do nothin'

said you were gonna do!

1393

I trusted you. That's what hurt.
I trusted you!

1394
01:16:00,848 --> 01:16:04,898
Don't you talk to me about trust!
I trusted you to protect me!

1395
01:16:04,977 --> 01:16:07,696
I made a mistake tonight, okay?

1396
01:16:08,105 --> 01:16:11,484
If that's your idea of an apology,
it ain't worth armadillo crap.

1397
01:16:11,567 --> 01:16:12,989
Well, I ain't apologizin'!

1398

I'm a business woman
payin' out double taxes!

I expect a little
protection for my money!

1400
01:16:18,240 --> 01:16:20,368
Where were you tonight? I
couldn't get you on the phone...

1401
01:16:20,451 --> 01:16:22,124
I was home in bed,
because you gave me

1402

your word you were closin' down.

1403

01:16:25,831 --> 01:16:27,111
none of this
would have happened.

1405
01:16:27,166 --> 01:16:28,668

Wallace couldn't

hold my jock!
You can't handle the job!

as your in-town wife.

1415

says that the Chicken Ranch

01:19:09,662 --> 01:19:13,712
is involved with and under the
influence of organized crime.

1445

the Governor himself

will come out of
his long silence

1455
01:19:36,021 --> 01:19:39,616
I have no independent recollection
of going to the Chicken Ranch.

1456
01:19:39,692 --> 01:19:42,115
And I can only say,
as the most dedicated

1457
01:19:42,194 --> 01:19:44,572
anticommunist in
the state legislature,

1458
01:19:44,655 --> 01:19:46,202
that I must have been drugged

1459
01:19:46,282 --> 01:19:48,626
by communists or
communist sympathizers

1460
01:19:48,701 --> 01:19:52,547
and placed there to harm
my reputation and good name.

1461
01:19:52,788 --> 01:19:55,211
Reaction across
the state is split 50-50.

1462
01:19:55,291 --> 01:19:56,463
But here in the town of Gilbert,

1463
01:19:56,542 --> 01:19:58,215
the Chicken Ranch
has many supporters.

1464
01:19:58,711 --> 01:20:01,214
I ain't never seen anything
bad come out of there yet,

1465
01:20:01,297 --> 01:20:03,049
and I've lived here all my life.

1466
01:20:03,507 --> 01:20:06,477
Why, they attract a lot of
business to the community.

1467
01:20:06,552 --> 01:20:09,431
They pay their taxes. (CHUCKLES)
Just like you and me!

1468
01:20:10,014 --> 01:20:13,393
No one. No one was ever
forced to go up there.

1469
01:20:13,726 --> 01:20:17,105
My Frank, when he was alive, used
to go up there every Saturday.

1470
01:20:17,187 --> 01:20:21,158
I took it as a blessin'. Of course,
things were different then.

1471
01:20:21,483 --> 01:20:25,158
Nowadays women enjoy doin'
that sort of thing themselves.

1472
01:20:25,738 --> 01:20:27,866
At least, so I've been told.

1473
01:20:28,157 --> 01:20:31,161
The Chicken Ranch?
I think it's a good idea.

1474
01:20:31,243 --> 01:20:32,540
See, you take a lot of
young boys

1475
01:20:32,619 --> 01:20:34,462
and they're gonna be out
there lookin' for women.

1476
01:20:34,538 --> 01:20:36,415
If they can't find 'em,
they'll rape 'em.

1477
01:20:36,749 --> 01:20:39,878
And if they don't do that, they'll
run to other women and get diseases!

1478
01:20:40,252 --> 01:20:41,845
Those girls went to doctors.

1479

01:31:30,443 --> 01:31:32,866
Whew. Ed Earl.

1683
01:31:33,655 --> 01:31:38,126
You ever think about runnin' for office?
Huh? I swear.

1684
01:31:38,243 --> 01:31:40,245
You make that whorehouse
sound like a

1685
01:31:40,328 --> 01:31:41,830
damn nonprofit
recreational facility.

1686
01:31:43,039 --> 01:31:46,043
Governor, if
the citizens who elected me

1687
01:31:46,126 --> 01:31:48,174
found it necessary
for me to close it down,

1688
01:31:48,253 --> 01:31:49,926
I would close it down.

1689
01:31:50,005 --> 01:31:54,351
If Miss Mona and the girls that work
for her were jeopardizin' the health,

1690
01:31:54,426 --> 01:31:57,680
wealth or moral scruples of the
community, I would close it down.

1691
01:31:58,096 --> 01:32:00,098
If the place was just
a piddlin' nuisance,

1692
01:32:00,432 --> 01:32:03,527
an eyesore, a fire hazard,
I would close it down!

1693
01:32:03,601 --> 01:32:04,601
But there's nothin'.

1694

Here they are, Governor.
What you've been waitin' for.

1697
01:32:16,448 --> 01:32:18,416
Aha. I'm sorry, Ed Earl.

1698
01:32:18,491 --> 01:32:21,995
But the Chicken Ranch loses,
42 to 37, with 21% undecided.

What is that?

1700
01:32:23,621 --> 01:32:26,044
The polls. You can't expect
me to go against the polls.

1701
01:32:26,124 --> 01:32:27,216
This is what the people want.

1702
01:32:27,292 --> 01:32:29,420
Melvin still outside? Maybe I can
catch the television cameras

Good seein' ya.

As the Sheriff of

it's my duty to tell you that...

Inside.

1835
01:42:34,315 --> 01:42:35,942
See you're takin'
the old juke with you.

1836
01:42:36,108 --> 01:42:40,158
(LAUGHING) You know I couldn't
leave without my bell and my box.

1837
01:43:24,448 --> 01:43:25,700
Ed Earl?

1838
01:43:28,953 --> 01:43:30,751
This old place looks
kinda funny, don't it?

1839
01:43:31,997 --> 01:43:34,546
Ben Sawtuck bought all
my furniture and fixtures

1840
01:43:34,625 --> 01:43:37,094
and Langston downtown
is gonna sell the rest.

1841
01:43:42,258 --> 01:43:43,858
Mona, there's
something I wanna tell you.

1842
01:43:44,135 --> 01:43:45,808
I want you to
thank your boys for me.

1843
01:43:46,137 --> 01:43:47,480
Those sightseers and
reporters would have

1844
01:43:47,555 --> 01:43:48,852
got all out of
hand if it hadn't been

1845
01:43:48,931 --> 01:43:50,558
for your deputies
down at the gate.

1846
01:43:52,852 --> 01:43:54,274
Mona,
you know me better than that.

1847
01:43:54,353 --> 01:43:56,113
Ed Earl, I believe
the thing for you to do is

1848
01:43:56,147 --> 01:43:57,865
just to put this
whole thing behind you

1849
01:43:57,940 --> 01:43:59,942
just as quick as you can.

1850
01:44:00,025 --> 01:44:03,404
I've made a little money, I've laughed
some, I've danced to the music.

1851
01:44:03,487 --> 01:44:05,581
It's just time to pay
the fiddler, that's all.

1852
01:44:09,160 --> 01:44:10,787
Mona, we've been
together a long time.

1853
01:44:12,329 --> 01:44:14,627
Sometimes I think you know me
better than I know myself.

1854
01:44:17,293 --> 01:44:19,091
So you know how hard
this is for me to say.

1855
01:44:21,672 --> 01:44:23,015
I love you.

1856
01:44:25,843 --> 01:44:27,516
Will you marry me?

1857
01:44:27,928 --> 01:44:31,603
Oh, Ed Earl, I've loved you
since I was 16-years-old.

1858
01:44:32,141 --> 01:44:34,690
But I've thought about
this for a long time.

1859
01:44:35,102 --> 01:44:36,820
And as much as I'd
love for it to work,

1860
01:44:37,563 --> 01:44:40,362
I know deep down in my heart
it ain't never gonna be.

1861
01:44:41,066 --> 01:44:42,784
Didn't you hear what I said?

1862
01:44:43,027 --> 01:44:44,119
I did, darlin'.

1863
01:44:44,195 --> 01:44:46,698
But it's gonna
always be just like it is.

1864
01:44:47,490 --> 01:44:50,243
There just ain't no way
in this world it can work.

1865
01:44:51,076 --> 01:44:52,953
We could make it work.

1866
01:44:53,204 --> 01:44:54,706
Just have to give it a chance.
