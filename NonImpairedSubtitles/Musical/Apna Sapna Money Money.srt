00:03:27,354 --> 00:03:30,346
lt's payday. And we
don't have any cash.

40
00:03:32,893 --> 00:03:35,691
There's no balance in the bank.

41
00:03:36,630 --> 00:03:37,961
No one has improved.

42
00:03:40,233 --> 00:03:42,633
l wish these diamonds were real.

43
00:03:45,372 --> 00:03:48,170
''By the way, when are our diamonds
coming from lndia?''

44
00:03:48,241 --> 00:03:49,640
On the 1 st.

45
00:03:51,378 --> 00:03:53,778
Give them a cheque for the 5th.
- Which month?

46
00:03:53,847 --> 00:03:55,246
Hmm?

''Sir, what if lnspector Mane
confiscates the diamonds?''

51
00:04:07,794 --> 00:04:11,127
The one who touches my diamonds
worth 500 million..

52
00:04:11,798 --> 00:04:13,265
will lose his life!

53
00:04:14,067 --> 00:04:16,262
He's outside the circle of my trust.

54
00:04:17,070 --> 00:04:18,196
Take his ring out.

55
00:04:28,348 --> 00:04:32,682
Any news on Sanya?
- She's reached Goa.

56
00:04:33,687 --> 00:04:35,951
But what is the code of the
guy getting the diamonds?

57
00:04:37,424 --> 00:04:42,225
''Ding Dong, O baby sing a song.''

00:06:11,851 --> 00:06:15,844
A high that never ebbs

00:06:15,989 --> 00:06:20,790
''That's how inebriated
one gets on meeting me''

77
00:06:20,860 --> 00:06:24,853
''Even a dying man wakes
up hearing my message''

78
00:06:25,065 --> 00:06:29,126
''Even a dying man wakes

l'm the infamous Sanya

00:07:16,983 --> 00:07:22,046
Baby! Ding dong.
- l already sang a song.

98
00:07:23,857 --> 00:07:24,915
Yes.

99
00:07:26,326 --> 00:07:27,350
Okay.

100
00:07:27,427 --> 00:07:29,122
Stupid!
- l'm going.

101
00:07:46,946 --> 00:07:48,937
So the heroine got the ice cubes?

102
00:07:50,483 --> 00:07:52,883
''Yes, Carlos. All of 50.''

103
00:07:53,620 --> 00:07:55,281
And the story ahead?

104
00:07:55,388 --> 00:07:59,620
l remember the story ahead with
screenplay and dialogues.

105
00:07:59,893 --> 00:08:01,884
There's a small twist in the story.

106
00:08:02,028 --> 00:08:03,222
Twist?

107
00:08:03,429 --> 00:08:04,953
Producer's demand.

108
00:08:05,231 --> 00:08:07,290
A small change in the
direction of the story.

109
00:08:07,433 --> 00:08:09,401
Now the heroine will bring
the ice cubes..

110
00:08:09,469 --> 00:08:11,096
from Goa to Mumbai by train.

111
00:08:11,171 --> 00:08:12,638
What! Train?

112
00:08:13,039 --> 00:08:17,567
''Yes, so that a villain named Bra
and Sugar cannot catch her.''

113
00:08:18,044 --> 00:08:20,512
Remember; 30th!

114
00:08:21,047 --> 00:08:23,242
''Understood, Borkar?
- Yes, sir.''

115
00:08:24,918 --> 00:08:29,082
Carlos is making a film
named 50 lce Cubes.

116
00:08:29,255 --> 00:08:31,519
lt's a low budget film..

117
00:08:31,591 --> 00:08:33,525
..so he's asking the
heroine to travel by train.

118
00:08:33,660 --> 00:08:35,924
''ldiot, Borkar! don't bore me.''

119
00:08:36,329 --> 00:08:37,990
Heroine is Sanya.

120
00:08:38,331 --> 00:08:42,324
And 50 ice cubes means diamonds
worth 500 million.

121
00:08:42,435 --> 00:08:43,925
''What are you saying, sir?
- Yes.''

122
00:08:44,003 --> 00:08:45,265
That's what l'm saying.

123
00:08:45,538 --> 00:08:47,199
''But sir, how do you know?''

124
00:08:48,441 --> 00:08:53,606
''Carlos doesn't know himself
as much as l know him, Mane.''

125
00:08:55,114 --> 00:08:56,945
''Sir, remember the
raid four years ago?''

126
00:09:00,353 --> 00:09:02,947
''lt's confirmed news, sir. See
the headlines tomorrow morning.''

127
00:09:03,022 --> 00:09:06,958
lnspector Mane seized brown sugar
worth 50 million of Carlos.

128
00:09:07,126 --> 00:09:08,957
''Sir, l'm busy now, l'll
talk to you tomorrow.''

129
00:09:09,028 --> 00:09:10,689
Come..come.

130
00:09:11,097 --> 00:09:12,359
ls the Press ready?

131
00:09:14,133 --> 00:09:15,361
''Borkar.
- Yes, sir?''

132
00:09:15,435 --> 00:09:16,561
Open!

133
00:09:20,573 --> 00:09:23,041
Bra and Sugar instead
of brown sugar?

134
00:09:23,243 --> 00:09:24,437
No photo!

135
00:09:25,111 --> 00:09:27,306
That one day took away
everything from me.

136
00:09:27,580 --> 00:09:28,979
My position..

137
00:09:29,048 --> 00:09:30,310
''You are demoted, Mane!''

138
00:09:30,583 --> 00:09:32,050
My prestige in the department.

139
00:09:33,386 --> 00:09:35,047
The 30th will be my last.

140
00:09:35,321 --> 00:09:37,312
But this month has 31 days.

141
00:09:39,993 --> 00:09:41,984
''This time, it will end on the 30th.''

142
00:09:42,996 --> 00:09:46,989
And with it will end the game
that Sanya and Carlos..

143
00:09:47,066 --> 00:09:48,533
have been playing with me
for the last four years.

144
00:09:49,736 --> 00:09:53,399
''Carlos, the game begins now!''

145
00:09:54,674 --> 00:09:55,698
Play

146
00:09:55,775 --> 00:09:58,005
''Play the music, DJ''

147
00:09:58,077 --> 00:10:00,068
He's got to spin the disc

148
00:10:00,179 --> 00:10:02,340
l love to do it your way

149
00:10:02,482 --> 00:10:03,608
Show me the money

150
00:10:13,092 --> 00:10:17,495
''lf you want my love, sure
enough you'll get it''

151
00:10:17,563 --> 00:10:22,091
''lf you pay my bill, my
heart will be yours''

152
00:10:22,168 --> 00:10:25,296
''Money, show me the money''

153
00:10:26,673 --> 00:10:29,301
''lf you want romance,
there's no chance''

154
00:10:29,375 --> 00:10:31,206
Unless you wanna spend

155
00:10:31,377 --> 00:10:33,709
''Emotions are out, money is in''

156
00:10:33,780 --> 00:10:35,645
That's the latest craze

157
00:10:35,715 --> 00:10:38,707
''Money, show me the money''

158
00:10:42,055 --> 00:10:44,046
The heart desires money

159
00:10:46,793 --> 00:10:49,227
''There should be something
like that in life''

160
00:10:49,295 --> 00:10:52,458
Money! What is money?

161
00:10:52,565 --> 00:10:54,726
All happiness is money

162
00:10:55,068 --> 00:10:58,333
The whole world desires money

163
00:10:58,404 --> 00:11:01,339
Money! What is money?

164
00:11:02,075 --> 00:11:03,235
Sis!

165
00:11:08,748 --> 00:11:11,683
Cutting! You again?
- Here's your tea.

166
00:11:16,222 --> 00:11:20,682
What a hit song l was doing.
You simply woke me up.

167
00:11:21,561 --> 00:11:23,426
''From Hollywood, l landed
straight in Bollywood!''

168
00:11:24,764 --> 00:11:27,756
''That too, in this colony!
- Again the same dream..''

169
00:11:32,105 --> 00:11:36,838
''Yes, l have only one dream. My
video album will be released.''

170
00:11:37,110 --> 00:11:39,578
My poster will be all over
the place. Julie! Julie!

171
00:11:39,645 --> 00:11:41,636
l'll be famous in the
whole of Mumbai!

172
00:11:41,714 --> 00:11:43,181
''Sis, you are famous even now.''

173
00:11:43,616 --> 00:11:47,450
''A ruffian mentions Julie,
and he goes for a toss.''

174
00:11:48,855 --> 00:11:50,720
l swear.
- Buttering me?

175
00:11:50,790 --> 00:11:52,189
No.
- What do you want?

176
00:11:52,291 --> 00:11:53,451
lt's the 1 st today.

177
00:11:53,860 --> 00:11:56,192
How does your 1 st come
every three days?

178
00:11:59,132 --> 00:12:00,326
Buy a book this time.

179
00:12:01,267 --> 00:12:04,259
Now tell me today's news.

180
00:12:04,470 --> 00:12:08,201
Arjun is in the garage..
- So Shivani will be in the balcony.

181
00:12:08,274 --> 00:12:10,469
Shivani's blind father must
be praying in the temple.

182
00:12:10,543 --> 00:12:13,740
And our Badshah must've taken
his mug and run away again.

183
00:12:17,450 --> 00:12:20,476
My prayer mug! Stop!

184
00:12:23,222 --> 00:12:24,484
Leave it! Leave it!

185
00:12:28,428 --> 00:12:29,895
Mug!

186
00:12:31,898 --> 00:12:33,229
My prayer mug!

187
00:12:33,299 --> 00:12:34,493
Hey give it will you?

188
00:12:35,701 --> 00:12:37,828
Caught you! You are so soft!

189
00:12:37,904 --> 00:12:42,170
''Hey, half-blind! This is not
your dog, he's my son.''

190
00:12:42,308 --> 00:12:44,299
Where did he run away with my mug?

191
00:12:46,512 --> 00:12:48,639
''Here uncle, your junk has
turned into a Mercedes.''

192
00:12:48,714 --> 00:12:50,181
Really?
- All thanks to this.

193
00:12:50,316 --> 00:12:52,181
The trust of a trustworthy mechanic!

194
00:12:52,318 --> 00:12:55,845
How much do l pay you?
- Rs.500 for you.

195
00:12:55,922 --> 00:12:58,254
''Rs.500!
- No, only Rs.150.''

196
00:12:58,458 --> 00:13:01,723
Give it there.
- God bless you.

197
00:13:01,794 --> 00:13:04,592
Damn you! You were charging me more.

198
00:13:04,664 --> 00:13:08,725
Why is your name Arjun Fernandes?
lt should have been Honest.

199
00:13:09,335 --> 00:13:13,203
There's your babe.. Backside.

200
00:13:27,753 --> 00:13:32,622
''lf Shastri's daughter dries her dry
hair again and again, she'll go bald.''

201
00:13:33,626 --> 00:13:35,560
The signal is coming
from there too today.

202
00:13:36,429 --> 00:13:40,229
''lt is, but what do l do about
the crossing; her father?''

203
00:13:40,366 --> 00:13:43,961
Why worry about the crossing
in today's times?

204
00:13:44,303 --> 00:13:47,238
''When you two love each other,
what can the father do?''

205
00:13:47,573 --> 00:13:48,733
Tell her.

206
00:14:03,389 --> 00:14:04,583
''Shivani, l love you!''

207
00:14:13,799 --> 00:14:16,768
''Brother Arjun!
- Titli, don't run.''

208
00:14:16,836 --> 00:14:18,269
''What happened, dear?''

209
00:14:18,604 --> 00:14:23,268
Badshah..mug..Shastri.
- Shastri!

210
00:14:24,277 --> 00:14:26,745
''Badshah! Badshah! Move, man!''

211
00:14:26,812 --> 00:14:27,870
Hey move man!

212
00:14:31,751 --> 00:14:32,877
''Come, come!''

213
00:14:35,288 --> 00:14:37,347
l've got him! l've got him!

214
00:14:42,428 --> 00:14:44,419
Where can he go?

215
00:14:46,299 --> 00:14:49,359
Shastri! You bloody rogue!

216
00:15:02,715 --> 00:15:05,843
You bloody rogue! l won't spare
you. Someone catch him!

217
00:15:10,856 --> 00:15:13,324
''You wimp, l'll show you! - Listen..''

218
00:15:13,726 --> 00:15:15,819
Shivani! Shivani!

219
00:15:16,462 --> 00:15:19,590
Bloody old man! You watch
a woman bathing?

220
00:15:19,665 --> 00:15:20,791
Don't you feel ashamed?

221
00:15:20,866 --> 00:15:22,333
''Bobby, move aside!''

222
00:15:22,401 --> 00:15:24,869
''Bobby, move aside!
Bobby, move aside!''

223
00:15:24,937 --> 00:15:27,462
What can l do? God Himself
has kept me in between.

224
00:15:27,540 --> 00:15:28,666
ln between.

225
00:15:30,676 --> 00:15:34,806
Leave him! Leave him!

226
00:15:34,880 --> 00:15:37,610
''Please aunty! Father made a mistake.
Forgive him, please.''

227
00:15:38,351 --> 00:15:39,875
What mistake? Forgive for what?

228
00:15:39,952 --> 00:15:41,419
''Forget it, he cannot see.''

229
00:15:41,487 --> 00:15:43,751
''lf he cannot see, how did the
old man enter the bathroom?''

230
00:15:43,823 --> 00:15:46,018
Badshah took my mug in the bathroom.

231
00:15:46,092 --> 00:15:48,754
Who is teasing a woman of my colony?

232
00:15:48,828 --> 00:15:50,955
This old man saw me bathing.

233
00:15:51,030 --> 00:15:53,498
''l cannot see myself bathing,
how will l see her?''

234
00:15:53,566 --> 00:15:54,624
''Heard him, aunty?''

235
00:15:54,700 --> 00:15:55,962
He saw you bathing?
- Yes.

236
00:15:56,035 --> 00:15:58,367
Shastri has already been
punished so harshly.

237
00:16:07,046 --> 00:16:08,980
Shashtri! Shashtri!

238
00:16:09,582 --> 00:16:11,914
''Why are you shouting? l can't
see well, but l can hear well.''

239
00:16:11,984 --> 00:16:13,008
Tell me.

240
00:16:13,085 --> 00:16:15,053
''As soon as l find Badshah,
l'll return your mug.''

241
00:16:15,121 --> 00:16:17,988
''lmmerse your ashes in that
mug. Come, Shivani.''

242
00:16:18,391 --> 00:16:19,449
Father!

243
00:16:20,993 --> 00:16:23,723
''Shastriji, this is me, Bobby.''

244
00:16:23,796 --> 00:16:24,888
l wanted to return your chain.

245
00:16:24,964 --> 00:16:28,991
''Chain? Until today, your dog stole
mine and other people's things.''

246
00:16:29,068 --> 00:16:30,899
Now you started stealing
chains? You thief!

247
00:16:30,970 --> 00:16:32,403
Shut up!

248
00:16:38,544 --> 00:16:39,909
''Who did you call a thief,
you bespectacled man!''

249
00:16:40,946 --> 00:16:42,413
You!

250
00:16:42,481 --> 00:16:45,143
Hey! Don't you dare touch me.
He stole my daughter's chain.

251
00:16:45,418 --> 00:16:48,012
''Your daughter has stolen his peace
and sleep, what about that?''

252
00:16:48,087 --> 00:16:49,952
Don't you dare mention my daughter's
name with your dirty tongue!

253
00:16:50,022 --> 00:16:51,819
You bloody cheap singer!

254
00:16:55,561 --> 00:16:56,960
Leave! Leave! - Move!

255
00:16:57,430 --> 00:16:58,761
He called me a cheap singer?

256
00:16:59,965 --> 00:17:01,432
The bloody bespectacled man! l'll..

257
00:17:15,581 --> 00:17:17,776
''2x1=2, 2x2=6, 2x3=4.''

258
00:17:17,850 --> 00:17:19,841
You'll always be a tea vendor!

259
00:17:20,519 --> 00:17:21,645
Study!

260
00:17:21,921 --> 00:17:23,650
He called me a cheap singer?

261
00:17:23,989 --> 00:17:27,516
Just let my album get released.
- Photo album?

262
00:17:29,095 --> 00:17:32,462
Will you eat the whole year's quota
here? ls it your father's money?

263
00:17:32,865 --> 00:17:35,459
''Don't scold, Julie, or he'll
eat two pancakes more.''

264
00:17:35,534 --> 00:17:38,469
Eat some more.
- l don't want.

265
00:17:38,604 --> 00:17:39,798
Butterfly.

266
00:17:44,977 --> 00:17:48,606
''Sorry, Julie. Because of me..
- l feel sorry for you.''

267
00:17:49,615 --> 00:17:50,877
l don't care about myself.

268
00:17:51,217 --> 00:17:54,209
That Shastri insults you always.

269
00:17:54,887 --> 00:17:57,014
l don't know what's so special
about that girl.

270
00:17:57,623 --> 00:18:01,081
Just tell me once and there'll be
a queue of girls waiting for you.

271
00:18:12,238 --> 00:18:15,901
''Listen Arjun, you are a Christian..''

272
00:18:17,243 --> 00:18:19,177
and she is a Hindu.

273
00:18:20,513 --> 00:18:21,912
How will she come to you?

274
00:18:24,250 --> 00:18:25,649
She will.

275
00:18:28,521 --> 00:18:30,716
Just let me carry my voice
to her heart once.

276
00:18:31,791 --> 00:18:37,024
Just let me meet her alone once.
Just once. Please!

277
00:18:38,664 --> 00:18:39,858
Julie.

278
00:18:41,200 --> 00:18:42,224
Hello.

279
00:18:42,301 --> 00:18:44,599
''Shivani and that boy will make
a great pair, Shastriji.''

280
00:18:44,870 --> 00:18:46,531
l called them without knowing
anything about them..

281
00:18:46,605 --> 00:18:47,731
''at your behest, Priest.''

282
00:18:48,541 --> 00:18:51,203
The boy's father is coming
to see Shivani on the 1 st.

283
00:18:51,811 --> 00:18:53,005
That's good.

284
00:18:55,548 --> 00:18:56,708
Bless you.

285
00:19:00,553 --> 00:19:04,284
''Oh my God! Under this blanket, the
bed bugs are biting me everywhere.''

286
00:19:05,157 --> 00:19:07,284
''Don't fumble, close the blanket.''

287
00:19:07,560 --> 00:19:08,891
Shastri will be coming now.

288
00:19:11,063 --> 00:19:12,621
The temple bells are not ringing.

289
00:19:12,832 --> 00:19:15,824
''Arjun, be bold and tell her today.''

290
00:19:15,901 --> 00:19:16,959
Yes.

291
00:19:17,703 --> 00:19:20,228
What do l say? What do
l do about her father?

292
00:19:20,706 --> 00:19:24,836
Don't worry about the father.

293
00:19:24,977 --> 00:19:31,576
''Because, to distance the father,
something is going to happen now.''

294
00:19:31,650 --> 00:19:32,708
He's come.

295
00:19:34,086 --> 00:19:35,713
Hello. Shastri speaking.

296
00:19:35,921 --> 00:19:39,584

299
00:19:46,999 --> 00:19:48,057
Mumbai.

300
00:19:48,200 --> 00:19:51,727
But this is a Mumbai number.

304
00:20:02,948 --> 00:20:05,610
But l can pay you only
5.1 million rupees.

305
00:20:05,684 --> 00:20:09,620
5.1 million!
- Hello.. hello..?

306
00:20:09,688 --> 00:20:10,746
Hello!

307
00:20:10,956 --> 00:20:14,084
''Hello..Shastriji, l
cannot hear anything.''

308
00:20:14,159 --> 00:20:15,820
l can hear everything.

309
00:20:15,895 --> 00:20:18,227
''lf you are not free, l'll
call some other Shastri.''

310
00:20:18,297 --> 00:20:20,697
l'm free! When do you want
the ritual performed?

311
00:20:20,900 --> 00:20:24,768
Hello! l think it's
a network problem.

312
00:20:24,837 --> 00:20:27,169
Hold on. Network problem?

313
00:20:28,374 --> 00:20:32,242
Today is very auspicious.
Distribute this money among beggars.

314
00:20:32,645 --> 00:20:36,172
Can you hear me now? Queen..
Queen Mother.

315
00:20:44,857 --> 00:20:45,983
Hello Queen.

316
00:20:46,125 --> 00:20:47,649
Hold on.

317
00:20:51,230 --> 00:20:52,857
''You dropped the prayer mug, Shivani!''

318
00:20:52,932 --> 00:20:54,058
l'm not Shivani.

319
00:20:56,402 --> 00:20:59,166
''Listen Arjun, my father
has fixed my alliance.''

320
00:20:59,939 --> 00:21:01,804
l cannot go against his wishes.

321
00:21:01,874 --> 00:21:05,173
Shivani listen to me.
Shivani listen.

322
00:21:05,244 --> 00:21:07,178
He has taken my prayer mug!
- Shivani.

323
00:21:07,246 --> 00:21:09,271
The boy's family is coming
from Kerala on the 1 st.

324
00:21:09,348 --> 00:21:10,372
''Shivani, l..''

325
00:21:10,449 --> 00:21:13,009
''lf they like me, no one
will ask my opinion.''

326
00:21:13,085 --> 00:21:15,144
Shivani. - Daddy has come. - Daddy!

327
00:21:15,688 --> 00:21:17,383
l'll have to marry that boy.

328
00:21:17,456 --> 00:21:18,753
Shivani!

329
00:21:26,832 --> 00:21:28,299
My mug!

330
00:21:30,202 --> 00:21:31,294
Yes!

331
00:21:33,872 --> 00:21:36,773
But do you love me or not?
- No.

332
00:21:37,443 --> 00:21:40,105
''No?
- l do, idiot!''

333
00:21:40,446 --> 00:21:42,778
That is why l'm telling
you to do something.

334
00:21:43,716 --> 00:21:45,445
You have time until the 1 st.

335
00:21:45,718 --> 00:21:49,381
Or you'll have to tell stories
to my children all your life.

336
00:21:53,192 --> 00:21:56,719
''Arjun, your problem
is very problematic.''

337
00:21:57,863 --> 00:21:59,728
l have thought of something.
- What?

338
00:22:00,332 --> 00:22:02,323
l'll forget her.
- Very good.

339
00:22:03,135 --> 00:22:04,864
Great idea! Congratulations.
Good night.

340
00:22:04,937 --> 00:22:06,063
''Julie, where are you going?
- Let's go, Cutting.''

341
00:22:06,138 --> 00:22:08,197
Listen! Julie!
- What?

342
00:22:08,941 --> 00:22:10,340
You took it seriously.

343
00:22:11,010 --> 00:22:13,945
She's told you to do something and
is herself sleeping peacefully.

344
00:22:14,747 --> 00:22:16,271
''She is awake, Julie.
- Awake..''

345
00:22:28,894 --> 00:22:31,761
''Do something, Arjun.
- What do l do?''

346
00:22:31,964 --> 00:22:33,158
Let me think.

347
00:22:33,499 --> 00:22:38,266
My mom used to say when things
cannot be got straight..

348
00:22:38,337 --> 00:22:39,964
go the crooked way.

349
00:22:40,105 --> 00:22:44,769
Meaning?
- Find a guy who is crooked.

350
00:22:44,910 --> 00:22:46,172
Crooked..

351
00:22:47,179 --> 00:22:52,378
There is! There is one man
who was born crooked.

352
00:22:52,451 --> 00:22:53,782
Who?

353
00:22:54,353 --> 00:22:56,844
''Kishan, my cousin.''

354
00:23:04,329 --> 00:23:08,288
''Who is carefree, and
has charming eyes''

355
00:23:08,967 --> 00:23:12,801
''About who, every girl is crazy''

356
00:23:12,938 --> 00:23:14,405
He's Kisna

357
00:23:15,407 --> 00:23:16,465
He's Kisna

358
00:23:18,277 --> 00:23:21,872
''Where's Kishan? Where is
he? Kishan, come out!''

359
00:23:21,980 --> 00:23:24,471
Where did you disappear with
the money of us Nepalese?

360
00:23:24,550 --> 00:23:27,348
''l swear by my Afghani father,
and Nepalese mother..''

361
00:23:27,419 --> 00:23:28,886
l won't spare you!

362
00:23:29,221 --> 00:23:30,813
''Shut up, old man!''

363
00:23:33,425 --> 00:23:36,223
Rana has taken the contract
to kill Kishan.

364
00:23:36,962 --> 00:23:41,331
''l, Rana Jung Bahadur, promise..''

365
00:23:41,400 --> 00:23:45,234
that l will get the money of
all of you back from Kishan.

366
00:23:45,838 --> 00:23:48,898
Glory to Rana!

367
00:23:48,974 --> 00:23:50,965
Rana! - Kancha Cheena. - Rana!

368
00:23:51,043 --> 00:23:52,908
What?

369
00:23:53,011 --> 00:23:57,380
Surround the house! Ensure
the dog doesn't escape.

370
00:23:57,449 --> 00:23:58,848
Come on. Let's go.

371
00:24:12,931 --> 00:24:14,023
What are you doing?

372
00:24:14,099 --> 00:24:15,862
The old man has gone mad.

373
00:24:15,934 --> 00:24:17,595
He takes us to be dogs
and is beating us?

374
00:24:17,870 --> 00:24:19,861
''No, l take you to be Kishan,
and am beating you.''

375
00:24:20,873 --> 00:24:23,865
''l'm not Kishan, l'm
looking for Kishan.''

376
00:24:23,942 --> 00:24:25,876
Even l'm looking for Kishan.

377
00:24:26,879 --> 00:24:31,282
''He told me l protect people,
but who will protect me?''

378
00:24:31,416 --> 00:24:33,941
What if my money is stolen?
- He told me the same thing.

379
00:24:34,019 --> 00:24:36,146
That is why l gave
him all the money.

380
00:24:36,221 --> 00:24:37,950
Even l gave him everyone's money.

381
00:24:38,056 --> 00:24:43,961
He blew up all our money in
the casino and ran away.

382
00:24:45,497 --> 00:24:47,965
''Old man, how do you know?''

383
00:24:49,635 --> 00:24:51,899
l'm a guard at that casino.

384
00:24:51,970 --> 00:24:53,961
''Now?
- l was, before the theft.''

385
00:24:57,042 --> 00:25:02,036
Thapa! The old man is going to die.
Take him to the hospital in a taxi.

386
00:25:02,114 --> 00:25:04,582
Take him.

387
00:25:04,650 --> 00:25:06,049
Let's find Kishan.

388
00:25:44,456 --> 00:25:47,448
Kishan?
- Yes. Kishan.

389
00:25:47,526 --> 00:25:49,289
Where can you run away
with our money?

390
00:25:50,963 --> 00:25:53,022
''Next mission, railway station.''

391
00:25:53,599 --> 00:25:55,089
Let's go. Come on.

392
00:26:04,142 --> 00:26:06,440
ldiot! Can't you see
where you're going?

393
00:26:06,645 --> 00:26:09,705
l am seeing.
- Rascal!

394
00:26:15,988 --> 00:26:17,182
Excuse me.

395
00:26:18,056 --> 00:26:19,182
Excuse me.

396
00:26:22,127 --> 00:26:23,321
Water..

397
00:26:24,663 --> 00:26:27,325
''Hey, sit properly.''

398
00:26:29,334 --> 00:26:32,735
''Sorry, l didn't notice.''

399
00:26:33,538 --> 00:26:36,200
''lf you sit like that, you
won't be respected at home.''

400
00:26:37,142 --> 00:26:38,404
You are too much!

401
00:26:40,479 --> 00:26:43,209
Watching babes?
- No. Water.

402
00:26:43,348 --> 00:26:48,479
ls it? What's her age?
- Water!

403
00:26:48,620 --> 00:26:50,520
''There is water in the toilet,
you don't have to carry it.''

404
00:26:50,622 --> 00:26:52,613
No. No. You haven't understood.

405
00:26:52,758 --> 00:26:55,022
Drinking water!

406
00:26:55,627 --> 00:26:58,562
l cannot get off and go.
l'm carrying luggage.

407
00:26:59,765 --> 00:27:03,098
Shall l give you one trouble?
- Try giving me.

408
00:27:03,368 --> 00:27:06,098
Keep a watch on my luggage.

409
00:27:07,773 --> 00:27:09,172
Luggage?

410
00:27:09,374 --> 00:27:13,105
You are too much! This luggage.

411
00:27:14,179 --> 00:27:16,170
This luggage?
- Yes.

412
00:27:16,248 --> 00:27:20,446
''Had you sent it by post,
it would've taken Rs.15.''

413
00:27:20,786 --> 00:27:24,552
Why are you spending so much money
and spoiling the railway reputation?

414
00:27:24,656 --> 00:27:28,057
''Actually, l'm going to meet
my son's would be in-laws..''

415
00:27:28,126 --> 00:27:30,651
for the first time.

416
00:27:31,196 --> 00:27:34,063
''Neither have they seen me,
nor have l seen them.''

417
00:27:34,132 --> 00:27:36,225
''Neither do they know me,
nor do l know them.''

418
00:27:36,468 --> 00:27:39,528
Having my name and address on
the bag will make things easy.

419
00:27:39,604 --> 00:27:41,799
My name is Sarju Maharaj..

420
00:27:43,608 --> 00:27:45,132
Banaraswala.

421
00:27:45,610 --> 00:27:49,239
What?
- Sarju Maharaj Banaraswala.

422
00:27:53,151 --> 00:27:55,278
Sarju Maharaj. Sarju.

423
00:27:56,154 --> 00:27:59,419
S for seven. S for seven.

424
00:27:59,758 --> 00:28:02,090
''Yes, tell me.
- They are coming to see Shivani.''

425
00:28:02,494 --> 00:28:05,691
Everything l have is at stake.
- Everything even l have is at stake.

426
00:28:06,231 --> 00:28:09,291
Can you come to Mumbai and help me?
- Hold on.

427
00:28:16,742 --> 00:28:18,505
Can you lend me some money?
- No.

428
00:28:20,846 --> 00:28:22,438
What time is the first
train from here?

429
00:28:31,123 --> 00:28:32,249
Excuse me..

430
00:28:32,457 --> 00:28:36,655
''Where is Kishan? You're not lying,
are you? You dropped Kishan here?''

431
00:28:36,728 --> 00:28:39,322
''l'm speaking the truth,
l left Kishan here.''

432
00:28:39,398 --> 00:28:41,457
''He's Kishan, he can
disappear anywhere.''

433
00:28:41,533 --> 00:28:43,797
''Half of you check there,
half of you check here.''

434
00:28:46,671 --> 00:28:50,129
''Uncle, sit comfortably.''

435
00:28:51,710 --> 00:28:54,201
''You wanted to get water, didn't you?''

436
00:28:54,413 --> 00:28:59,316
''Yes, but who will go now.
There's such a big queue.''

437
00:28:59,384 --> 00:29:01,147
''lf l miss the train, it
will be another hassle.''

438
00:29:01,219 --> 00:29:03,551
Why do you worry about the queue?

439
00:29:03,622 --> 00:29:05,419
The people standing at
the water fountain..

440
00:29:05,490 --> 00:29:08,220
just go and tell them you
are Kishan's relative.

441
00:29:08,326 --> 00:29:11,659
Now who is this Kishan?

442
00:29:12,330 --> 00:29:15,231
He's a very big crook.. contractor.

443
00:29:15,333 --> 00:29:17,767
He has the contract for
painting entire Goa.

444
00:29:18,303 --> 00:29:20,897
''Yes. This platform,
that water cabin..''

445
00:29:21,173 --> 00:29:22,663
he only has painted it all.

446
00:29:22,908 --> 00:29:25,843
Go out and say it.
- And it'll become easy?

447
00:29:25,911 --> 00:29:29,779
You'll be done!
- l'll go then.

448
00:29:33,185 --> 00:29:36,245
Move aside! l will fill water first.

449
00:29:36,321 --> 00:29:39,188
''Hey, who are you?
- l'm Kishan's uncle.''

450
00:29:41,259 --> 00:29:44,854
What did you say?
- l'm Sarju Maharaj Banaraswala.

451
00:29:44,930 --> 00:29:48,195
Fill water. l'm Kishan's
foster uncle.

452
00:29:48,266 --> 00:29:50,393
What?
- Foster.

453
00:29:50,469 --> 00:29:53,199
l only taught him to paint.

454
00:29:53,271 --> 00:29:54,602
Kishan's uncle?

455
00:29:54,673 --> 00:29:56,334
Kancha Cheena.

456
00:30:00,612 --> 00:30:03,672
They sing very well.
- They even play well.

457
00:30:03,815 --> 00:30:05,544
''Children, lift him.''

458
00:30:05,817 --> 00:30:08,718
''Because l'm Kishan's relative,
will you take me to the train?''

459
00:30:08,787 --> 00:30:10,345
''We'll take you very far, old man.''

460
00:30:10,422 --> 00:30:16,224
''May your soul rest in peace.
- Hey, take me to the train!''

461
00:30:31,843 --> 00:30:33,504
''How are you, Mallika?
- Shut up!''

462
00:31:00,272 --> 00:31:02,968
''Ash, you're sitting
very comfortably.''

463
00:31:03,041 --> 00:31:05,737
''Sanya, you're the girl,
you're the one''

464
00:31:08,680 --> 00:31:10,944
Looks like my journey is going
to be full of torment.

465
00:31:12,484 --> 00:31:14,884
''Had l known before, l wouldn't
dash into her back.''

466
00:31:18,290 --> 00:31:21,453
l'm Sarju Maharaj Banaraswala.
Hello!

467
00:31:23,728 --> 00:31:27,892
l'm Sanya. Your face looks familiar.

468
00:31:29,034 --> 00:31:32,765
''Possible.. possible.
My face, very famous.''

469
00:31:32,904 --> 00:31:36,465
l used to teach Kathak on Radio.

470
00:31:37,309 --> 00:31:38,640
You must have seen it.

471
00:31:39,477 --> 00:31:40,808
l'll teach you too.

472
00:31:41,379 --> 00:31:45,645
The whole journey will pass
dancing away in merriment.

473
00:31:46,051 --> 00:31:48,645
Behave yourself! Bloody old man!

474
00:31:51,723 --> 00:31:53,657
''By the way, will you
sleep up, or down?''

475
00:31:53,725 --> 00:31:54,749
What!

476
00:31:54,826 --> 00:31:59,820
''l don't mind up, but if it's
down, it will be great.''

477
00:31:59,931 --> 00:32:01,330
What do you mean?

478
00:32:02,467 --> 00:32:07,063
l was talking about the berth.
What did you think?

479
00:32:07,939 --> 00:32:09,736
You are talking of
birth during death?

480
00:32:09,808 --> 00:32:12,333
Go there and sleep
or l'll kill you!

481
00:32:12,744 --> 00:32:14,871
''Calm down, girl.
- Bloody!''

482
00:32:16,348 --> 00:32:20,478
''Both down, closed eyes. You
in the front, l behind.''

483
00:32:32,530 --> 00:32:33,690
What do you want?

484
00:32:33,965 --> 00:32:37,696
That the whole world should know
again you are the idiot Mane?

485
00:32:37,769 --> 00:32:41,034
Great!
- Thank you.

486
00:32:41,773 --> 00:32:43,365
What do you want?

487
00:32:43,441 --> 00:32:46,376
To catch Sanya redhanded this time.

488
00:32:46,444 --> 00:32:48,776
How many times have you got
your face blackened..

489
00:32:48,847 --> 00:32:50,974
trying to catch Sanya redhanded?

490
00:32:51,783 --> 00:32:54,581
''You remember, Mane?
- Last time, sir.''

491
00:32:54,719 --> 00:32:56,778
''For blackening your face?
- No, sir.''

492
00:32:57,389 --> 00:33:01,052
''Sir, this time l have
confirmed news..''

493
00:33:01,126 --> 00:33:02,787
that Sanya is coming
to Mumbai by train..

494
00:33:02,861 --> 00:33:04,988
..with diamonds worth 500 million.

495
00:33:05,063 --> 00:33:06,792
''By train?
- Yes, sir.''

496
00:33:07,599 --> 00:33:14,732
Last time you said Sanya is coming
to MLA hostel to deliver a gun.

497
00:33:15,073 --> 00:33:18,668
''When we raided the premises,
10 MLAs were caught.''

498
00:33:19,411 --> 00:33:23,404
''Remember how?
- Yes, sir. All nude.''

499
00:33:24,015 --> 00:33:27,815
''Along with you, even l was almost
stripped of my uniform.''

500
00:33:27,952 --> 00:33:31,820
''Remember?
- Yes. Sign, sir.''

501
00:33:33,091 --> 00:33:34,956
''Thank you very much, doctor.''

502
00:33:36,428 --> 00:33:40,922
''Look, l've told you several times
not to allow Titli to run so much.''

503
00:33:40,999 --> 00:33:44,833
Does she listen to me? l've
told her so many times.

504
00:33:45,570 --> 00:33:48,130
''Don't worry, l'll talk to her.''

505
00:33:48,206 --> 00:33:49,901
Please take care.

506
00:33:50,108 --> 00:33:52,508
Don't you want to get well soon?
- l don't want it.

507
00:33:52,610 --> 00:33:54,635
''Little.
- Julie, l don't want it.''

508
00:33:54,713 --> 00:33:58,513
''Little.
- No, l don't like it.''

509
00:33:58,583 --> 00:33:59,845
Don't you want to get better?

510
00:34:00,185 --> 00:34:01,584
Julie.
- Titli.

511
00:34:05,857 --> 00:34:09,657
''Titli, no running, dancing,
jumping from today.''

512
00:34:10,462 --> 00:34:11,986
''You will listen to your
brother, won't you?''

513
00:34:12,630 --> 00:34:17,124
''Okay, but l will dance a lot on
your and Shivani's wedding.''

514
00:34:18,470 --> 00:34:20,961
''Until now, it's your brother
who is dancing for Shivani.''

515
00:34:21,072 --> 00:34:23,666
''When the wedding takes
place, you dance.''

516
00:34:23,942 --> 00:34:25,136
Sure?
- Sure.

517
00:34:25,210 --> 00:34:28,668
Then get married soon. l
don't have too much time.

518
00:34:33,885 --> 00:34:35,079
Don't say that.

519
00:34:45,096 --> 00:34:46,495
Tea!

520
00:34:49,033 --> 00:34:52,491
''Hey Borkar, hurry! Or
the train will leave.''

521
00:34:55,707 --> 00:34:56,833
''Over there, sir.''

522
00:34:59,677 --> 00:35:00,837
Come soon.

523
00:35:50,895 --> 00:35:52,157
Good morning.

524
00:35:55,967 --> 00:35:57,161
Hey girl!

525
00:35:57,235 --> 00:35:58,725
Who's this rascal?

526
00:36:01,706 --> 00:36:07,303
Mane. Recognise me?
- Mane darling! How exciting.

527
00:36:08,580 --> 00:36:09,740
Got transferred to

528
00:36:09,814 --> 00:36:11,042
the railway police?

529
00:36:11,749 --> 00:36:13,910
''Hey!
- Sorry, sir.''

530
00:36:16,654 --> 00:36:24,857
l have to conduct a search.
- Search. Everything is open for you

531
00:36:26,231 --> 00:36:27,926
Search whatever you like.

532
00:36:29,601 --> 00:36:31,125
Just don't tickle me.

533
00:36:31,202 --> 00:36:32,999
Every eye loves me

534
00:36:33,071 --> 00:36:35,596
l'm the infamous Sanya

535
00:36:35,773 --> 00:36:37,604
Every eye loves me

536
00:36:37,742 --> 00:36:39,767
l'm the infamous Sanya

537
00:36:43,681 --> 00:36:44,807
''Yes, sir?''

538
00:36:46,784 --> 00:36:47,944
Check.

539
00:36:57,362 --> 00:36:58,761
Found anything?

540
00:36:59,631 --> 00:37:01,622
What can l get if l look
at the wrong place?

541
00:37:02,634 --> 00:37:06,229
That means we'll have to take
madam to the police station.

542
00:37:07,839 --> 00:37:11,240
''Mane darling, settle
things here only.''

543
00:37:11,776 --> 00:37:13,835
Don't try to act smart.

544
00:37:16,381 --> 00:37:17,780
''Yes, madam.''

545
00:37:17,849 --> 00:37:19,316
Borkar!
- Sir!

546
00:37:19,384 --> 00:37:20,783
What are you doing?

547
00:37:21,986 --> 00:37:25,251
''What will come next?
- One more demotion for you, sir.''

548
00:37:26,991 --> 00:37:28,253
l'm talking about the station.

549
00:37:35,733 --> 00:37:37,132
ls this platform no.13?

550
00:37:37,201 --> 00:37:39,328
lt is platform no.13. How
many times will you ask?

551
00:37:39,404 --> 00:37:40,666
lt is something to be asked about.

552
00:37:41,673 --> 00:37:43,004
You came following us even here?

553
00:37:43,074 --> 00:37:45,269
''You saw?
- What do you mean, l saw?''

554
00:37:45,343 --> 00:37:46,674
''l smelt it! Shivani, you
must have told him.''

555
00:37:46,744 --> 00:37:48,211
Father.. father..
- What?

556
00:37:48,279 --> 00:37:51,737
He's come to take his brother.
- How did you know?

557
00:37:52,216 --> 00:37:55,208
lt came in the paper.
- No reading the paper from today!

558
00:37:55,286 --> 00:37:56,685
Come with me.

559
00:37:56,854 --> 00:37:58,082
''Shastriji, l'm Bobby.''

560
00:37:58,156 --> 00:37:59,680
What are you doing?
You come with me.

561
00:38:00,825 --> 00:38:02,850
When l had come for the
first time to Mumbai..

562
00:38:11,703 --> 00:38:13,295
Where is he?
- Found him?

563
00:38:13,438 --> 00:38:15,872
l searched the platform again.

564
00:38:16,107 --> 00:38:19,372
''lf he's not come, l'll commit
suicide under this train.''

565
00:38:19,444 --> 00:38:23,244
But did he call and tell you
he's coming by this train?

566
00:38:23,314 --> 00:38:24,713
You don't know him.

567
00:38:24,849 --> 00:38:26,714
''He'll get into a train,
and get off a plane.''

568
00:38:26,784 --> 00:38:28,046
Wow!

569
00:38:31,923 --> 00:38:35,120
''Mane darling, please! Listen to me.''

570
00:38:43,001 --> 00:38:44,992
''Borkar, what is it? Come.
- Yes, sir.''

571
00:38:45,069 --> 00:38:48,470
''Madam, come!
- Madam, move. Don't bore Borkar.''

572
00:38:49,874 --> 00:38:51,068
Careful!
- Sorry.

573
00:39:04,255 --> 00:39:05,415
Sarju Maharaj?
- No.

574
00:39:05,490 --> 00:39:06,821
lt cannot be him.

575
00:39:09,093 --> 00:39:12,756
Hello! l'm Sarju Maharaj
Banaraswala.

576
00:39:12,897 --> 00:39:16,765
''l'm Shastriji. Shivani,
seek his blessings.''

577
00:39:17,101 --> 00:39:19,035
Yes.
- Bless you.

578
00:39:21,773 --> 00:39:22,967
''Bless you, dear.''

579
00:39:25,043 --> 00:39:26,510
''May you always remain married, dear.''

580
00:39:26,778 --> 00:39:29,440
''Enough, Shivani. He has to
walk home on those legs.''

581
00:39:29,514 --> 00:39:30,845
Dear.
- Come on up.

582
00:39:31,449 --> 00:39:32,780
Shall we go?
- Yes.

583
00:39:33,785 --> 00:39:35,116
''Father, this way.''

584
00:39:48,933 --> 00:39:50,127
Sarju Maharaj.

585
00:39:52,003 --> 00:39:56,872
''Please come, Sarju Maharaj.
This is a poor man's abode.''

586
00:39:57,942 --> 00:40:01,343
Poor man's abode? Do all the
poor people come to eat here?

587
00:40:02,413 --> 00:40:04,472
''l'm the poorest of all,
Sarju Maharaj.''

588
00:40:05,883 --> 00:40:10,946
But l have enriched my daughter
with values and culture.

589
00:40:11,422 --> 00:40:15,483
''She prays four times, goes to
the temple eight times..''

590
00:40:15,560 --> 00:40:19,826
and fasts for 16 Mondays.

591
00:40:20,364 --> 00:40:23,356
She spends the entire day
in the worship of God.

592
00:40:24,969 --> 00:40:27,335
Shivani.. Shivani dear.

593
00:40:27,905 --> 00:40:29,236
''Focus, Shastri.''

594
00:40:31,042 --> 00:40:37,345
''Recite the Shiv-Vani.
- Sing, dear.''

595
00:40:39,450 --> 00:40:43,511
l won't get married

596
00:40:51,329 --> 00:40:53,923
l won't get married

597
00:40:55,867 --> 00:40:57,858
Put down the palanquin

598
00:40:58,870 --> 00:41:00,030
Stop!

599
00:41:02,473 --> 00:41:03,940
She's even learning classical dance.

600
00:41:05,276 --> 00:41:08,268
What a unique combination of
classical music and western dance.

601
00:41:08,346 --> 00:41:11,941
And her voice.. horrible!
- What did you say?

602
00:41:12,416 --> 00:41:15,874
l have a bad throat.
Can l get some water?

603
00:41:15,953 --> 00:41:21,550
Sure.. Shivani.. get
warm water for him.

604
00:41:26,297 --> 00:41:28,162
''Today is her 1 7th Monday,
that's why.''

605
00:41:28,299 --> 00:41:33,498
''1 7, 18, 19, 20, 21 , 22..''

606
00:41:35,239 --> 00:41:39,107
You idiots! l told you to make
him lie down on an ice slab.

607
00:41:39,243 --> 00:41:41,575
''Ranaji, we have made him lie on ice.''

608
00:41:41,646 --> 00:41:43,307
Then did the ice melt?

609
00:41:44,248 --> 00:41:46,079
You made me sit on the Himalayas.

610
00:41:47,919 --> 00:41:51,446
Oh! You made him lie on
such a big ice slab..

611
00:41:51,522 --> 00:41:52,921
and yet he didn't say anything?

612
00:41:53,057 --> 00:41:54,922
''Shall l tell you
something today, son?''

613
00:41:54,992 --> 00:41:56,425
''Yes, tell me quickly.''

614
00:41:56,494 --> 00:41:58,519
A man doesn't feel cold.

615
00:41:58,596 --> 00:42:00,655
Shut up! Where is Kishan?

616
00:42:01,265 --> 00:42:03,927
Who Kishan? l don't know any Kishan.

617
00:42:04,001 --> 00:42:09,997
l only know Shastri.
- Now who is this dog Shastri?

618
00:42:10,942 --> 00:42:15,538
''Tell me soon, or l'll fill hot
water in your underpants.''

619
00:42:17,615 --> 00:42:19,082
The old man wants hot water?

620
00:42:19,283 --> 00:42:22,218
l'll give him such hot water that
his tongue will get blisters.

621
00:42:39,503 --> 00:42:40,629
Kishan!

622
00:42:56,053 --> 00:42:57,577
Thank you.
- You!

623
00:42:59,123 --> 00:43:00,317
''Bless you, dear.''

624
00:43:00,391 --> 00:43:02,382
Those are the values l've
given my daughter.

625
00:43:03,060 --> 00:43:05,119
She will seek your blessings
five times a day.

626
00:43:06,264 --> 00:43:08,664
That's nice.
- You are searching for something?

627
00:43:08,733 --> 00:43:10,724
''l'm meeting her the first time,
l'll have to give her something.''

628
00:43:12,069 --> 00:43:14,264
He must have bought something for
his would be daughter-in-law.

629
00:43:17,275 --> 00:43:18,742
''This is for you, child.''

630
00:43:19,610 --> 00:43:20,668
Sandal.

631
00:43:20,745 --> 00:43:22,610
Sandals for you.

632
00:43:23,014 --> 00:43:27,007
Our family follows a tradition.

633
00:43:30,755 --> 00:43:32,154
These are a little big.

634
00:43:32,223 --> 00:43:35,556
''Child, they are big people, have
big thoughts, big hearts.''

635
00:43:35,626 --> 00:43:38,618
''Wear them. lf they don't
fit you, l'll wear them.''

636
00:43:40,531 --> 00:43:42,021
''Right, Samdhiji? (daughter's
father-in-law)''

637
00:43:42,166 --> 00:43:43,292
Sabji? (vegetable)

638
00:43:43,367 --> 00:43:47,098
''Not vegetable, or eatable,
l'm talking of Samdhiji.''

639
00:43:47,171 --> 00:43:49,639
My would be daughter-in-law's father.

640
00:43:49,707 --> 00:43:52,107
''lf you don't believe me,
call up and ask.''

641
00:43:52,209 --> 00:43:53,642
Rana!

642
00:43:53,778 --> 00:43:55,575
There are many boys in Mumbai.

643
00:43:55,646 --> 00:43:59,707
But l'd heard a lot about
your family prestige.

644
00:43:59,784 --> 00:44:01,649
That's why l called you over.

645
00:44:01,719 --> 00:44:05,382
Once you give consent to my
daughter's alliance with your son..

646
00:44:05,456 --> 00:44:07,185
we can have a quick engagement
and marriage.

647
00:44:08,059 --> 00:44:09,185
Who is it?

648
00:44:09,627 --> 00:44:10,651
The phone.

649
00:44:10,728 --> 00:44:15,062
Oh! Phone. Who is it?
- Sarju Maharaj.

650
00:44:15,132 --> 00:44:16,793
lt's for you.
- Me?

651
00:44:17,068 --> 00:44:18,330
Yes. lt must be from Benares.

652
00:44:19,603 --> 00:44:23,733
Can l get a glass of milk?
- Milk? l'll get you a buffalo.

653
00:44:27,745 --> 00:44:29,076
Hello.

654
00:44:29,613 --> 00:44:34,607
''Shastri, is Sarju Maharaj, your
Samdh.. your relative?''

655
00:44:34,819 --> 00:44:37,583
''Half my relatives are dead,
half are not alive.''

656
00:44:37,655 --> 00:44:40,590
''The rest are not born, then
where did he crop up from?''

657
00:44:41,158 --> 00:44:43,353
''Enough of time-pass, now disconnect.''

658
00:44:46,497 --> 00:44:48,089
You are too much!

659
00:44:48,165 --> 00:44:52,101
See! Truth doesn't need proof.

660
00:44:52,269 --> 00:44:53,566
''Kacha, China.
- Yes?''

661
00:44:53,637 --> 00:44:55,502
Free me.
- Get chilly powder!

662
00:44:57,608 --> 00:45:01,442
We didn't get anything
even this time.

663
00:45:01,512 --> 00:45:02,536
''Sir, you..''

664
00:45:02,613 --> 00:45:04,843
We didn't get anything
even this time.

665
00:45:05,316 --> 00:45:08,114
You will get me transferred
to the Andamans.

666
00:45:08,185 --> 00:45:11,120
Great!

667
00:45:11,188 --> 00:45:14,123
She'll get diamonds worth
500 million by train?

668
00:45:14,291 --> 00:45:16,782
You can buy a whole train
for 100 million.

669
00:45:16,861 --> 00:45:19,193
Great!

670
00:45:19,864 --> 00:45:23,197
''Sir, can l go?
- Sir..''

671
00:45:24,402 --> 00:45:26,461
''Yes, you can go.
- Sir, you..''

672
00:45:27,671 --> 00:45:30,640
Give your brain a search
warrant for intelligence.

673
00:45:30,708 --> 00:45:31,732
''Sir, you..''

674
00:45:31,809 --> 00:45:35,142
''lf it doesn't relent,
give it a shock.''

675
00:45:35,212 --> 00:45:37,339
''Sir, you..
- Stop your nonsense!''

676
00:45:37,481 --> 00:45:39,642
''lt's not nonsense, Carlos,
l'm speaking the truth.''

677
00:45:40,284 --> 00:45:42,809
''Fearing Mane, l hid the
diamonds in a bag..''

678
00:45:42,887 --> 00:45:44,411
on which was pasted its address.

679
00:45:44,622 --> 00:45:46,214
''But don't you worry, darling.''

680
00:45:46,357 --> 00:45:48,655
l'll go and get the bag.

681
00:45:48,893 --> 00:45:53,330
''Sanya, if you don't call
me within half an hour..''

682
00:45:54,765 --> 00:45:58,633
l'll assume you are outside
my circle of trust.

683
00:45:59,904 --> 00:46:01,838
And you know what it means.

684
00:46:05,643 --> 00:46:08,578
''Trust me, darling. l'm
going there right away.''

685
00:46:09,713 --> 00:46:12,648
''Hey, taxi! 6, Alvaris House, Bandra?''

686
00:46:12,783 --> 00:46:15,377
''6, Alvaris House, Bandra?''

687
00:46:15,519 --> 00:46:16,781
l won't go.
- Stupid!

688
00:46:16,921 --> 00:46:20,379
''Carlos, l'll call you later.
Driver, move.''

689
00:46:21,325 --> 00:46:22,519
Where?

690
00:46:27,198 --> 00:46:28,392
l won't relent!

691
00:46:29,533 --> 00:46:31,194
Sweet dreams. Go to sleep.

692
00:46:41,879 --> 00:46:47,818
''Oh God! after Shivani's marriage,
take care of my moonlit nights too.''

693
00:46:48,285 --> 00:46:52,722
''l mean, get me married too
and sharpen my vision.''

694
00:46:54,358 --> 00:46:56,724
Thank you!

695
00:47:07,505 --> 00:47:10,633
''Kishan, my brother!
Thank you so much.''

696
00:47:10,708 --> 00:47:11,766
You're welcome.

697
00:47:11,842 --> 00:47:13,935
But how did you become Sarju Maharaj
and enter Shastri's house?

698
00:47:14,011 --> 00:47:15,911
''Sometimes, suddenly,
something terrible..''

699
00:47:16,247 --> 00:47:17,271
Who's this terrible thing?

700
00:47:17,348 --> 00:47:22,911
Your bro.. l'm Sis
Single ldli Singh.

701
00:47:22,987 --> 00:47:24,386
Parents had gone to the
south for honeymoon.

702
00:47:24,455 --> 00:47:28,755
l order two idlis for breakfast..
- But can eat only one.

703
00:47:28,826 --> 00:47:30,259
''Thank you.
- Okay, whatever.''

704
00:47:31,395 --> 00:47:33,920
Hi!
- Hi! What's this!

705
00:47:33,998 --> 00:47:35,989
Bobby Mohabati.

706
00:47:36,467 --> 00:47:39,265
''Your name should have been Mombatti
(candle), not Mohabati.''

707
00:47:39,336 --> 00:47:40,360
Why?

708
00:47:40,437 --> 00:47:42,769
Because God made you at
leisure with wax..

709
00:47:42,840 --> 00:47:44,671
but forgot to light the
wick in your brain.

710
00:47:46,410 --> 00:47:49,004
You're laughing? Do
you brush your teeth?

711
00:47:56,854 --> 00:48:00,017
''Arjun, ask your brother
to mind his tongue.''

712
00:48:01,358 --> 00:48:04,350
''Kishan, she's Julie.
- What Lie?''

713
00:48:07,798 --> 00:48:08,890
What's he saying about me?

714
00:48:08,966 --> 00:48:10,797
Relax! Shastri will get up.

715
00:48:15,439 --> 00:48:16,633
See! She spoke again.

716
00:48:18,375 --> 00:48:20,309
''Julie, relax!
- Julie, no!''

717
00:48:23,914 --> 00:48:25,381
He's my Badshah.

718
00:48:26,050 --> 00:48:27,813
He's the only intelligent
one among your friends.

719
00:48:27,885 --> 00:48:29,318
Kishan!

720
00:48:30,454 --> 00:48:32,319
Now should l tell him
what l've planned next?

721
00:48:32,389 --> 00:48:33,481
What's your plan?

722
00:48:33,591 --> 00:48:36,924
Shastri! Shastri!

723
00:48:36,994 --> 00:48:38,018
Overacting!

724
00:48:38,095 --> 00:48:40,063
Okay. Shastri.

725
00:48:40,598 --> 00:48:42,327
You have to wake him up too.

726
00:48:42,499 --> 00:48:44,330
''Shastri, come out!''

727
00:48:46,403 --> 00:48:47,802
''Badshah, call him.''

728
00:48:49,340 --> 00:48:53,401
Your honour is in danger.
- Your honour is in danger.

729
00:48:53,477 --> 00:48:57,607
Your honour is at stake.
Do you understand?

730
00:49:01,085 --> 00:49:02,814
What is it? Why are you shouting?

731
00:49:02,886 --> 00:49:04,012
My Samdhi will wake up.

732
00:49:06,357 --> 00:49:08,825
''He won't wake up, he's run away.''

733
00:49:08,892 --> 00:49:12,350
Run away? Where?
- Listen. ln the bar..

734
00:49:26,710 --> 00:49:28,769
''Shastri, come soon!''

735
00:49:28,879 --> 00:49:31,973
We'll show you where your Samdhi
is disgracing himself.

736
00:49:33,050 --> 00:49:37,043
He's colour blind. He
won't be able to see.

737
00:49:37,121 --> 00:49:39,988
Come on. Sit down. Come on.
- What are you doing?

738
00:49:42,459 --> 00:49:44,393
Why are you going reverse?
- We'll reach faster.

739
00:49:44,461 --> 00:49:45,928
Go that way.

740
00:49:51,935 --> 00:49:57,805
From the silken drape..

741
00:49:58,008 --> 00:50:03,469
when l peeped out smiling

742
00:50:06,016 --> 00:50:12,683
My beloved ripped his heart

743
00:50:14,058 --> 00:50:20,554
And placed it at my feet

744
00:50:23,100 --> 00:50:24,624
A mischievous look

745
00:50:28,038 --> 00:50:29,437
A mischievous look

746
00:50:32,776 --> 00:50:34,175
A mischievous look

747
00:50:37,514 --> 00:50:38,981
A mischievous look

748
00:50:48,459 --> 00:50:49,858
A mischievous look

749
00:50:50,627 --> 00:50:52,458
ln the protection of lashes

750
00:50:53,063 --> 00:50:55,623
The naughty attitude

751
00:50:55,699 --> 00:50:57,462
May kill me

752
00:50:57,801 --> 00:50:59,632
Words reduce..

753
00:51:00,204 --> 00:51:01,967
the effect

754
00:51:02,639 --> 00:51:05,073
l'm nobody's beloved

755
00:51:05,142 --> 00:51:07,076
l'm a cold wind

756
00:51:07,478 --> 00:51:11,608
''Your restless heartbeat
will not find peace''

757
00:51:15,119 --> 00:51:19,215
''Dhak-dhak, dhak-dhak, goes my heart''

758
00:51:19,823 --> 00:51:24,089
My mischievous look may wound you

759
00:51:24,228 --> 00:51:28,756
''Dhak-dhak, dhak-dhak, goes my heart''

760
00:51:29,500 --> 00:51:33,561
My mischievous look may wound you

761
00:51:33,637 --> 00:51:38,506
''l will pamper your
attitude all life''

762
00:51:38,575 --> 00:51:43,103
''Or l'll die placing my
heart at your feet''

763
00:51:43,180 --> 00:51:48,584
''ln my breaths ring the
tinkle of your bangles''

764
00:51:48,652 --> 00:51:53,055
''Khan-khan, khan-khan,
ring your bangles''

765
00:51:53,123 --> 00:51:57,651
Your mischievous look may kill me

766
00:51:57,995 --> 00:52:02,523
''Khan-khan, khan-khan,
ring your bangles''

767
00:52:02,699 --> 00:52:07,796
Your mischievous look may kill me

768
00:52:31,562 --> 00:52:36,556
''See how nature, with
its own hands..''

769
00:52:36,633 --> 00:52:41,229
made me for love

770
00:52:41,305 --> 00:52:45,833
''Everything in the world
is under my control''

771
00:52:45,976 --> 00:52:50,572
Don't take me to be a statue

772
00:52:50,647 --> 00:52:55,107
''Why are you so proud about
your beauty, love?''

773
00:52:55,185 --> 00:52:57,585
''A lamp has to light up
and fade away''

774
00:52:57,654 --> 00:52:59,986
Why don't you understand that?

775
00:53:00,057 --> 00:53:05,586
''Your footfalls ring chan-chan,
chan-chan''

776
00:53:05,662 --> 00:53:10,065
''Chan-chan, chan-chan
ring your anklets''

777
00:53:10,133 --> 00:53:15,002
Your mischievous look may kill me

778
00:53:18,342 --> 00:53:20,003
Your mischievous look

779
00:53:23,347 --> 00:53:24,814
Your mischievous look

780
00:53:34,024 --> 00:53:38,620
''ln my desolate heart
if you step foot..''

781
00:53:38,695 --> 00:53:43,632
my barren desire will bloom

782
00:53:43,700 --> 00:53:48,137
''Since a eons, my soul is
restless without you''

783
00:53:48,205 --> 00:53:52,699
''lf you touch me, l'll find solace''

784
00:53:52,776 --> 00:53:57,645
''Don't desire to touch me
even by mistake, crazy man''

785
00:53:57,714 --> 00:54:02,310
My beauty will burn you to cinders

786
00:54:02,386 --> 00:54:07,790
You snatch my shyness

787
00:54:07,858 --> 00:54:11,726
''Chal-chal, chal-chal oozes
coyness from my face''

788
00:54:12,663 --> 00:54:16,997
My mischievous look may wound you

789
00:54:17,067 --> 00:54:21,663
''Chal-chal, chal-chal oozes
coyness from my face''

790
00:54:22,205 --> 00:54:26,733
My mischievous look may wound you

791
00:54:36,253 --> 00:54:40,747
''Khan-khan, khan-khan,
ring your bangles''

792
00:54:40,857 --> 00:54:45,351
Your mischievous look may kill me

793
00:54:45,762 --> 00:54:49,960
''Khan-khan, khan-khan,
ring your bangles''

794
00:54:50,300 --> 00:54:55,237
Your mischievous look may kill me

795
00:55:08,719 --> 00:55:10,710
Good you came before
the rape started.

796
00:55:14,324 --> 00:55:18,385
''Shastri, you? Over here? Welcome!''

797
00:55:18,729 --> 00:55:22,722
''Had l known even you liked this,
wouldn't we have come together?''

798
00:55:22,866 --> 00:55:25,801
What..?
- To have a good time. Naughty!

799
00:55:25,902 --> 00:55:29,394
You cheap man! Don't
you feel ashamed..

800
00:55:29,740 --> 00:55:32,732
''to behave like that, having come
to this decent man's house?''

801
00:55:33,877 --> 00:55:35,401
Who are you?
- l..

802
00:55:35,479 --> 00:55:36,878
Shut up!

803
00:55:37,347 --> 00:55:39,247
This is between us.

804
00:55:39,483 --> 00:55:43,078
''Shastri, your daughter and my
son will make a great pair.''

805
00:55:43,153 --> 00:55:45,417
Don't you dare take
my daughter's name!

806
00:55:45,489 --> 00:55:47,354
''Focus, Shastri!
- Thank you.''

807
00:55:47,424 --> 00:55:50,154
''Forget my daughter, l won't even get
my bitch married into your family.''

808
00:55:50,227 --> 00:55:52,354
''lf the father is like that, how
will the son be? Let's go!''

809
00:55:52,429 --> 00:55:54,021
''Shastri.
- Shastri. - Okay, come here.''

810
00:55:54,498 --> 00:55:55,965
''Shastri, relax.''

811
00:55:58,502 --> 00:56:00,766
''Thanks, Kishan. Thank you so much.''

812
00:56:00,904 --> 00:56:02,098
Anytime.

813
00:56:05,375 --> 00:56:06,774
Hey Julie.

814
00:56:09,379 --> 00:56:10,778
Thank you.

815
00:56:16,253 --> 00:56:19,245
Wonder who those lucky people were

816
00:56:19,322 --> 00:56:22,951
Hello.. hello.. hello?

817
00:56:24,528 --> 00:56:26,462
''Excuse me, you have the network?''

818
00:56:27,297 --> 00:56:29,857
l cannot get mine. Can
l borrow your phone?

819
00:56:30,534 --> 00:56:33,264
Come on! Give me your phone.
- Get lost!

820
00:56:33,336 --> 00:56:36,464
Come on! Please give me your phone.

821
00:56:40,410 --> 00:56:42,071
Got the network?
- Yes.

822
00:56:42,345 --> 00:56:43,812
Say hello.
- Hello.

823
00:56:44,014 --> 00:56:45,140
Now leave.

824
00:56:45,215 --> 00:56:48,207
Hello. Hello.

825
00:56:48,285 --> 00:56:50,480
''Kishan, your ticket.
- Thanks.''

826
00:56:50,821 --> 00:56:53,881
Your red cheek!
- l'm sorry.

827
00:56:54,424 --> 00:56:55,891
What a slap it was!

828
00:56:55,992 --> 00:56:58,085
''lt hit my cheek, but my
heart felt the impact.''

829
00:56:58,361 --> 00:56:59,828
Shall l tell you something?

830
00:56:59,963 --> 00:57:01,828
''Until today, l had many
excuses to run away''

831
00:57:02,165 --> 00:57:04,099
lt's the first time l've got
an excuse to stay back.

832
00:57:05,168 --> 00:57:06,499
l'm thinking..
- Stay back.

833
00:57:08,171 --> 00:57:09,433
How long will you wander?

834
00:57:11,041 --> 00:57:12,167
Settle down.

835
00:57:13,844 --> 00:57:17,109
''No, l'm not destined to
hold anyone's hand..''

836
00:57:18,381 --> 00:57:19,848
only get slapped.

837
00:57:21,518 --> 00:57:23,110
Now stop worrying about me.

838
00:57:23,253 --> 00:57:25,847
''Go to Shivani's home, plead
with her father..''

839
00:57:25,922 --> 00:57:26,980
and ask for Shivani's hand.

840
00:57:27,057 --> 00:57:29,116
Or another Sarju Maharaj
will come again and..

841
00:57:29,359 --> 00:57:30,451
No.

842
00:57:32,996 --> 00:57:34,258
l'll leave.
- Bye.

843
00:57:38,401 --> 00:57:39,868
See you.

844
00:57:42,272 --> 00:57:43,364
Thanks.

845
00:58:01,057 --> 00:58:04,891
''lf we don't find Kishan, we'll sell
him by the kilo in the flea market.''

846
00:58:05,629 --> 00:58:07,096
''Shut up, you dog!''

847
00:58:07,230 --> 00:58:09,892
Now let's see how Kishan does
not come to get you freed.

848
00:58:20,177 --> 00:58:21,371
Hands up!

849
00:58:22,412 --> 00:58:24,903
''l didn't tell you, l
told him. Hands up!''

850
00:58:25,382 --> 00:58:27,907
''Look Rana, do whatever
you want with me..''

851
00:58:27,984 --> 00:58:29,576
but please spare my uncle.

852
00:58:29,653 --> 00:58:30,915
''Shut up, old man!''

853
00:58:30,987 --> 00:58:32,648
l'll do whatever you say.

854
00:58:32,923 --> 00:58:34,982
l have promised aunty
l will save uncle.

855
00:58:35,058 --> 00:58:36,582
''Release him, please.. please!''

856
00:58:36,993 --> 00:58:39,427
You love your uncle very much.

857
00:58:39,996 --> 00:58:41,258
l don't.

858
00:58:41,932 --> 00:58:43,263
Free the old man.

859
00:58:44,534 --> 00:58:45,933
Uncle..

860
00:58:48,939 --> 00:58:51,134
Why is the old man running?

861
00:58:51,675 --> 00:58:56,408
''Rana, all the money is with uncle,
and he's running away.''

862
00:58:56,479 --> 00:58:58,003
Catch him!

863
00:58:58,081 --> 00:59:00,276
Catch the old man!

864
00:59:02,352 --> 00:59:05,219
''Hey old man, stop!''

865
00:59:07,357 --> 00:59:11,020
''Half of you follow him, half of
you come with me. Hey Kishan!''

866
00:59:17,701 --> 00:59:19,032
Glory to money

867
00:59:19,102 --> 00:59:20,126
Glory to money

868
00:59:20,203 --> 00:59:21,295
Say glory to money

Say glory to money

875
00:59:29,446 --> 00:59:32,040
Our dream..

876
00:59:32,115 --> 00:59:34,106
My dream is money money

877
00:59:34,184 --> 00:59:36,118
My dream is money money

878

Where did the rogue go?

885
00:59:51,401 --> 00:59:52,993
Where did he go?
- He went this way.

886
00:59:53,069 --> 00:59:54,536
Where did he go?
- He went this way.

887
00:59:54,604 --> 00:59:56,003
Shut up!

888
00:59:56,072 --> 01:00:00,600
l want to dress up for my beloved

889
01:00:02,512 --> 01:00:06,004
Kishan! That rogue is somewhere here.

890
01:00:06,549 --> 01:00:11,486
''That bloody Kishan! lf l find
him, l won't spare him!''

891
01:00:12,155 --> 01:00:17,218
''O God, please! l have kept this
secret from my husband..''

892
01:00:17,294 --> 01:00:19,626
since the past 1 7 years. Please
don't ever let him know.

893
01:00:19,696 --> 01:00:21,095
''Please, God!''

894
01:00:35,779 --> 01:00:41,775
l have to dress up for Ranaji

895
01:00:54,664 --> 01:00:57,064
Hey girl!

896
01:01:08,244 --> 01:01:10,075
Kishan will be somewhere here.

897
01:01:12,148 --> 01:01:13,274
Shastri.

898
01:01:18,088 --> 01:01:23,355
''Who is carefree, and
has charming eyes''

899
01:01:23,760 --> 01:01:30,097
''About who, every girl is crazy''

900
01:01:30,300 --> 01:01:32,097
He's Kisna

901
01:01:32,836 --> 01:01:34,633
He's Kisna

902
01:01:35,305 --> 01:01:38,103
He's Kisna

903
01:01:41,845 --> 01:01:43,312
He's Kisna

904
01:01:44,848 --> 01:01:47,112
l've heard this song before.

905
01:01:47,183 --> 01:01:49,447
''Ranaji, that's Kishan's song.''

906
01:01:49,519 --> 01:01:54,456
How is this girl singing
Kishan's song? Sister!

907
01:01:55,125 --> 01:01:58,117
Get lost!
- Sister!

908
01:02:01,631 --> 01:02:02,723
Who are you?

909
01:02:19,883 --> 01:02:23,478
Come.. come..

910
01:02:28,425 --> 01:02:30,484
''Hey Superman.
- Yes, damsel?''

911
01:02:31,161 --> 01:02:34,494
''Save this damsel, please!
- From me?''

912
01:02:35,298 --> 01:02:38,563
''Not from you, from those
dagger wielding men.''

913
01:02:39,669 --> 01:02:43,161
''From six of them?
- Not six, they are three.''

914
01:02:43,239 --> 01:02:44,570
Three? Okay.
- Go.

915
01:02:45,241 --> 01:02:48,369
Don't you feel ashamed to
tease a hapless woman?

916
01:02:48,445 --> 01:02:51,175
''Go back to school.
- Shut up, old man!''

917
01:02:51,247 --> 01:02:54,842
Go and watch Fashion TV.
- Okay. He got scared.

918
01:02:54,918 --> 01:02:57,785
They called you old man.
- Doesn't matter.

919
01:02:57,921 --> 01:03:00,788
Show your machismo and
save my youthfulness.

920
01:03:00,857 --> 01:03:02,722
Go!
- No!

921
01:03:18,475 --> 01:03:21,706
''Kacha, China, if this old
man falls and dies..''

922
01:03:21,778 --> 01:03:23,405
we'll get into trouble.

923
01:03:23,546 --> 01:03:26,879
''We'll leave him and go to
the other old man, Sarju.''

924
01:03:32,222 --> 01:03:34,281
They have left.
- Really?

925
01:03:34,357 --> 01:03:35,756
My Krish!

926
01:03:36,826 --> 01:03:38,225
Thank you.

927
01:03:42,232 --> 01:03:44,223
You have come to this neighborhood
for the first time?

928
01:03:44,300 --> 01:03:45,767
l've never smelt you before.

929
01:03:45,835 --> 01:03:47,928
''lt was a joke. l mean, never
seen you here before.''

930
01:03:48,004 --> 01:03:49,437
Whose house have you come to?

931
01:03:51,708 --> 01:03:59,376
l.. l.. actually.. Arjun! Hi!

932
01:03:59,516 --> 01:04:02,246
Who is this aunty?
- l don't know.

933
01:04:02,652 --> 01:04:03,778
Who's she?

934
01:04:11,594 --> 01:04:12,754
l know!

935
01:04:12,996 --> 01:04:18,457
''Aunty! When did you come?
- l had to come, son.''

936
01:04:20,270 --> 01:04:23,797
''Shastriji, she's my aunt. She's come
to stay with me for 15-20 days.''

937
01:04:23,940 --> 01:04:25,999
You'll stay?
- She surely will.

938
01:04:26,276 --> 01:04:29,268
Listen. l live upstairs.
Up the stairs and inside.

939
01:04:29,345 --> 01:04:30,539
Do come up some time.

940
01:04:30,680 --> 01:04:33,877
''Now that l have come, the
up and down will happen.''

941
01:04:33,950 --> 01:04:35,281
''Come, aunty.''

942
01:04:35,351 --> 01:04:39,287
Listen! Sorry. You didn't
tell me your name.

943
01:04:39,355 --> 01:04:40,822
l will just give myself. l mean..

944
01:04:40,890 --> 01:04:42,289

945
01:04:48,031 --> 01:04:49,555
Sania.
- Mirza.

946
01:04:49,899 --> 01:04:54,029
Sunaina aunty. We call her
Sania affectionately.

947
01:04:54,370 --> 01:04:57,464
Affectionately? What do l
call you affectionately?

948
01:04:58,474 --> 01:05:01,307
Affectionately.. call me Sania.

949
01:05:04,914 --> 01:05:06,905
''Sania, l love you.''

950
01:05:15,458 --> 01:05:20,327
''Mane.. darling, what are you up to?''

951
01:05:20,863 --> 01:05:24,594
What do you want?
- What l haven't done until today.

952
01:05:25,735 --> 01:05:28,465
''l got many offers, but
l refused them all.''

953
01:05:29,339 --> 01:05:32,467
l realise today what
a lovely thing it is.

954
01:05:32,942 --> 01:05:34,341
What?

955
01:05:37,847 --> 01:05:38,939
Bribe!

956
01:05:39,349 --> 01:05:43,752
l've rejected Rs.5055501 .50

957
01:05:44,354 --> 01:05:46,754
And what did l get in return? Zilch!

958
01:05:48,558 --> 01:05:51,425
All inspectors from my batch
have made so much progress.

959
01:05:51,527 --> 01:05:53,427
''They have a car, bungalow,
bank balance.''

960
01:05:53,896 --> 01:05:56,558
And they even have mothers.

961
01:05:59,102 --> 01:06:02,367
And me? l don't even have
lentils in my kitchen.

962
01:06:05,441 --> 01:06:09,377
''Mane darling, l feel pity for you.''

963
01:06:09,445 --> 01:06:14,974
No. l have decided now that
even l will have all of this.

964
01:06:15,051 --> 01:06:18,509
''Car, bank balance, and
a mobile phone too..''

965
01:06:19,122 --> 01:06:22,523
on which you receive
those MMS of girls.

966
01:06:23,526 --> 01:06:26,859
''l'll wear my uniform,
but not honesty.''

967
01:06:26,996 --> 01:06:30,397
''Wherever l go, l'll take
a flight. Three tier AC!''

968
01:06:30,566 --> 01:06:32,466
l'll get my whole house
air-conditioned.

969
01:06:33,136 --> 01:06:35,536
Three central ACs. That's
why l've brought you here.

970
01:06:35,605 --> 01:06:38,597
''To fix Acs?
- No, to strike a deal.''

971
01:06:39,409 --> 01:06:40,535
Deal?

972
01:06:43,012 --> 01:06:45,742
''Look Sanya, whatever
the world may say..''

973
01:06:46,416 --> 01:06:49,408
l know that only you
know where Carlos'..

974
01:06:49,485 --> 01:06:51,544
..diamonds worth
500 million are.

975
01:06:52,088 --> 01:06:54,488
''Listen to me, Mane..
- You listen to me, darling.''

976
01:06:55,625 --> 01:06:56,819
''You listen to me, darling.''

977
01:06:58,428 --> 01:07:00,157
''Sanya, what will Carlos give you?''

978
01:07:02,899 --> 01:07:06,426
25 hundred thousand?
50 hundred thousand?

979
01:07:07,970 --> 01:07:12,031
l'll give you 50% . 250 million!

980
01:07:13,710 --> 01:07:14,972
Tell me where the diamonds are.

981
01:07:15,511 --> 01:07:18,503
''As soon as l get them, we'll
leave the country.''

982
01:07:19,982 --> 01:07:21,916
The road is clear.

983
01:07:23,720 --> 01:07:28,123
''250 million mine, and
250 million yours!''

984
01:07:29,592 --> 01:07:31,992
''Tell me Sanya, will you help me?''

985
01:07:41,671 --> 01:07:42,797
Carlos.

986
01:07:51,547 --> 01:07:52,673
''Peter.
- Yes, sir?''

987
01:07:52,749 --> 01:07:54,216
Had you paid my telephone bill?

988
01:07:54,484 --> 01:07:57,078
l looted a bank day before
yesterday to pay the bill.

989
01:07:57,153 --> 01:07:59,485
Which bank?
- Your piggy bank.

990
01:08:01,991 --> 01:08:05,483
Sir.. sir..that was
the only money left.

991
01:08:06,229 --> 01:08:08,697
No one understands Hindi
here. Let's play.

992
01:08:10,032 --> 01:08:12,557
Sanya's intention has changed.

993
01:08:13,236 --> 01:08:15,500
Call up our sharp
shooter in Mumbai.

994
01:08:15,638 --> 01:08:17,833
''Sir, can l say something?
- Sure.''

995
01:08:17,907 --> 01:08:19,499
We didn't have work for him..

996
01:08:19,575 --> 01:08:22,237
so our sharp shooter took up a job
with the municipality to kill rats.

997
01:08:23,012 --> 01:08:24,502
You rat!

998
01:08:25,648 --> 01:08:27,639
Only Carlos can see his future.

999
01:08:29,919 --> 01:08:31,045
Sir..

1000
01:08:31,921 --> 01:08:33,980
Good shot!
- l know.

1001
01:08:35,525 --> 01:08:38,517
Who in Mumbai do you
think can help us?

1002
01:08:38,728 --> 01:08:42,528
''Cowshed, cowshed..''

1003
01:08:42,665 --> 01:08:46,123
''Cowshed, cowshed..''

1004
01:08:46,669 --> 01:08:50,537
''Cowshed, cowshed..''

1005
01:08:50,673 --> 01:08:54,006
''Cowshed, cowshed..''

1006
01:08:56,679 --> 01:08:57,941
Get the bullet.

1007
01:09:07,824 --> 01:09:09,553
''Brother, is the water in
the milk in proportion..''

1008
01:09:09,625 --> 01:09:10,751
or should we add more?

1009
01:09:10,960 --> 01:09:12,086
lt's okay.

1010
01:09:13,729 --> 01:09:18,826
''Brother, l need to..
- Will you do it in my ear?''

1011
01:09:19,635 --> 01:09:21,068
l have a small question.

1012
01:09:21,904 --> 01:09:25,032
Why do you see the
same film everyday?

1013
01:09:26,309 --> 01:09:28,072
l want to become Sarkar(don).

1014
01:09:28,177 --> 01:09:29,644
Sarkar (government)?

1015
01:09:29,712 --> 01:09:33,978
''Brother, when you stand in the shed,
the buffaloes stops giving milk.''

1016
01:09:34,050 --> 01:09:37,315
''When you pass the neighborhood,
girls stop flirting.''

1017
01:09:37,587 --> 01:09:40,579
''When you pass the street,
dogs stop barking.''

1018
01:09:40,656 --> 01:09:42,851
How will people vote for you?

1019
01:09:42,992 --> 01:09:46,257
ldiot! Sarkar means Don!

1020
01:09:46,329 --> 01:09:48,593
''Cowshed, cowshed..''

1021
01:09:48,664 --> 01:09:52,600
A don who Mumbai police
looks for in Dubai.

1022
01:09:53,603 --> 01:09:56,595
And Dubai police looks
for him in Malaysia.

1023
01:09:57,139 --> 01:10:02,736
And that rogue sits in China
sipping tea with Chong Pong.

1024
01:10:03,246 --> 01:10:06,943
Just one chance. l'll
shake up the city!

1025
01:10:07,216 --> 01:10:08,615
Brother..

1026
01:10:11,020 --> 01:10:12,146
Phone.

1027
01:10:14,357 --> 01:10:16,018
Hello.
- Mata Prasad.

1028
01:10:16,158 --> 01:10:19,787
''That's my name, tell me yours.
- Car-los.''

1029
01:10:20,029 --> 01:10:23,760
''lf you lost your car, go to the
police. l don't do such petty jobs.''

1030
01:10:23,833 --> 01:10:30,238
''Mata Prasad, this is Carlos,
the don, from Bangkok.''

1031
01:10:30,373 --> 01:10:32,898
Carlos! Greetings!

1032
01:10:33,309 --> 01:10:37,245
Every struggler's dream is to
work with Shubhash Ghai..

1033
01:10:37,313 --> 01:10:39,781
''in the film world, and with
Carlos in the underworld.''

1034
01:10:41,050 --> 01:10:42,711
l don't have any crime record.

1035
01:10:42,818 --> 01:10:44,718
l never got a chance
to commit any crime.

1036
01:10:45,121 --> 01:10:47,316
That's why l'm giving you a job.

1037
01:10:47,390 --> 01:10:50,655
''Who do l kill, how, where?''

1038
01:11:01,070 --> 01:11:04,665
Understood?
- Yes. You want Sanya.

1039
01:11:04,874 --> 01:11:09,140
''Not Sanya, Sa-niya.
- Yes, Sanya.''

1040
01:11:09,278 --> 01:11:14,739
Pick Sanya. Write the address.

1041
01:11:15,217 --> 01:11:16,741
Brother!
- Yes?

1042
01:11:16,819 --> 01:11:18,013
Write the address.
- Yes.

1043
01:11:18,087 --> 01:11:19,679
l'll just write down!

1044
01:11:19,755 --> 01:11:21,347
''6, Alvaris House..
What did you say?''

1045
01:11:21,424 --> 01:11:22,823
''6, Alvaris House.''

1046
01:11:25,194 --> 01:11:26,957
''6, Alvaris House, Bandra.''

1047
01:11:30,766 --> 01:11:32,028
''Thank you, Carlos!''

1048
01:11:32,435 --> 01:11:35,370
l'm a don!
- Brother!

1049
01:11:36,205 --> 01:11:39,697
''We'll have to go to Mumbai, Peter.
- We will have to.''

1050
01:11:39,842 --> 01:11:41,173
''This bungalow, the cars, the girls..''

1051
01:11:41,243 --> 01:11:43,711
l have paid them all by
post dated cheques.

1052
01:11:43,879 --> 01:11:47,975
You understand? The bank is refusing
to give us any more cheque books.

1053
01:11:48,184 --> 01:11:51,312
Go to Mumbai.. How will we go?

1054
01:11:51,854 --> 01:11:53,321
You have a warrant in
your name even there.

1055
01:11:53,389 --> 01:11:55,050
What if someone recognises you?

1056
01:12:00,997 --> 01:12:02,328
No one will recognise me.

1057
01:12:14,143 --> 01:12:15,269
Who is it?

1058
01:12:15,745 --> 01:12:19,340
''Recognise me?
- Sir, you?''

1059
01:12:19,882 --> 01:12:24,945
Where did you get this idea from?
- From old Hindi films.

1060
01:12:25,154 --> 01:12:26,746
From old Hindi films.

1061
01:12:29,492 --> 01:12:32,256
How many times have l told you not
to give the buffaloes grams.

1062
01:12:32,328 --> 01:12:34,091
Their ablution schedule changes.

1063
01:12:34,363 --> 01:12:36,763
Did they have to do
it over the address?

1064
01:12:38,300 --> 01:12:41,827
''6, Lavaris House?
- No.''

1065
01:12:43,039 --> 01:12:45,234
''6, Al Qaida House?
- No.''

1066
01:12:45,307 --> 01:12:46,774
Then what is the address?

1067
01:12:46,842 --> 01:12:49,777
''l remember!
- 6, Gulrez House, Bandra.''

1068
01:12:49,845 --> 01:12:51,836
Let's go!
- No.

1069
01:12:51,947 --> 01:12:54,973
''Tell me where Kishan is,
you bloody rogue!''

1070
01:12:55,051 --> 01:12:59,954
l've been asking you since half
an hour. Tell me where Kishan is!

1071
01:13:00,056 --> 01:13:03,787
Why are you shouting? Call up
Carlos again and ask him.

1072
01:13:03,859 --> 01:13:04,985
Shut up!

1073
01:13:05,928 --> 01:13:10,991
''Say something once that makes me
proud of you, not worry about you.''

1074
01:13:11,200 --> 01:13:13,395
You want to ruin my impression
on my first job?

1075
01:13:13,803 --> 01:13:15,202
Try to recollect!

1076
01:13:15,304 --> 01:13:18,330
''Ranaji, how will he speak?
- Why, is he dumb?''

1077
01:13:18,874 --> 01:13:22,810
Remove the tape.
- Why didn't you tell me before?

1078
01:13:22,878 --> 01:13:24,209
Bandra!

1079
01:13:24,346 --> 01:13:27,406
''6, Alvaris House, Bandra.
- 6, Alvaris House, Bandra.''

1080
01:13:29,885 --> 01:13:33,343
''l remember! 6, Alvaris House,
Bandra.''

1081
01:13:33,422 --> 01:13:34,821
Quiet!

1082
01:13:34,890 --> 01:13:35,914
Glory to money!

1083
01:13:35,991 --> 01:13:37,151
Say glory to money

1084
01:13:37,226 --> 01:13:38,352
Glory to money!

1085
01:13:38,828 --> 01:13:45,097
''Sania is calling me.
She's whistling''

1086
01:13:49,171 --> 01:13:52,902
Sania is my life

1087
01:14:00,049 --> 01:14:03,382
Sania is coming

1088
01:14:03,519 --> 01:14:05,384
Come.. come!

1089
01:14:05,454 --> 01:14:06,853
No.

1090
01:14:07,990 --> 01:14:12,484
Come.. come! l'm your love

1091
01:14:14,563 --> 01:14:15,655
Not here?

1092
01:14:33,549 --> 01:14:37,645
You've been fooling me all
this while like a horse

1093
01:14:37,720 --> 01:14:39,779
l won't spare you today

1094
01:14:42,925 --> 01:14:45,086
Drop that

1095
01:14:45,494 --> 01:14:47,155
''All right, you are a horse''

1096
01:14:48,497 --> 01:14:49,759
''Horsy, drop it''

1097
01:15:09,718 --> 01:15:10,844
Peter!

1098
01:15:11,453 --> 01:15:12,647
Yes sir?

1099
01:15:12,721 --> 01:15:17,624
When l said l wanted to
travel with chicks..

1100
01:15:17,693 --> 01:15:21,595
l meant girls. Not chicken!

1101
01:15:22,531 --> 01:15:24,692
''Was l that smart, you'd
be following me''

1102
01:15:25,868 --> 01:15:28,803
''l'm following you now. Chicks
and cheques, all are ready''

1103
01:15:44,153 --> 01:15:45,552
l'll take them to my palace

1104
01:15:45,621 --> 01:15:48,021
What palace?

1105
01:15:49,892 --> 01:15:53,020
''Everything sold. Bangkok, plane
tickets.. we used the money''

1106
01:15:54,563 --> 01:15:56,554
So where do l take them? Graveyard?

1107
01:15:57,833 --> 01:16:00,859
Brilliant idea. A don's
real hideout..

1108
01:16:00,936 --> 01:16:03,063
''neither lndia nor Pakistan,
only graveyard''

1109
01:16:05,674 --> 01:16:07,767
What are you upto? Don't waste them

1110
01:16:07,843 --> 01:16:09,242
Why pick up so many oranges?

1111
01:16:09,712 --> 01:16:12,647
''lf we don't find the same size
daily, it'll ruin the continuity''

1112
01:16:12,715 --> 01:16:14,876
Damn you! - That's why l
bought stock for 20 days

1113
01:16:14,950 --> 01:16:16,508
l haven't played Kishan
for 20 days ..

1114
01:16:16,585 --> 01:16:18,985
''.. at a trot, you think
l'll play Sania?''

1115
01:16:19,054 --> 01:16:25,857
You said you'll stay back. - For 28
years l didn't build my body..

1116
01:16:25,928 --> 01:16:29,955
''for Shivani's old man to bulldoze
it. - True, but..''

1117
01:16:30,032 --> 01:16:33,593
Only a girl with a solid FSl index
can possess a building like me

1118
01:16:34,603 --> 01:16:36,594
FSl ?
- Face

1119
01:16:38,540 --> 01:16:39,734
Structure

1120
01:16:41,877 --> 01:16:43,037
lntelligence

1121
01:16:48,717 --> 01:16:49,809
Bye sister.

1122
01:16:55,691 --> 01:16:59,024
''Brother Arjun, you forgot, didn't
you? - Oh, l'm so sorry''

1123
01:16:59,094 --> 01:17:00,721
Give me.. and a kiss

1124
01:17:00,796 --> 01:17:03,094
Good girl. Here you are

1125
01:17:06,835 --> 01:17:07,995
Sweet girl

1126
01:17:09,738 --> 01:17:11,933
Don't you think 100 bucks
were too much for a flower?

1127
01:17:12,007 --> 01:17:15,238
Her life is more precious.
- Meaning?

1128
01:17:15,911 --> 01:17:17,776
She has a hole in her heart

1129
01:17:18,847 --> 01:17:21,281
''Doctors say, if she isn't operated
upon within six months..''

1130
01:17:35,931 --> 01:17:37,592
How much would the surgery cost?

1131
01:17:40,202 --> 01:17:41,328
Way beyond what we can afford

1132
01:17:44,673 --> 01:17:47,107
''Still, everyone helps them
in whatever way they can''

1133
01:17:47,676 --> 01:17:49,735
''Brother Arjun, you're back?''

1134
01:17:51,680 --> 01:17:53,614
That's Cutting. His father wanted
to make a great man out of him

1135
01:17:53,682 --> 01:17:55,309
''Have tea, nourish yourself''

1136
01:17:56,218 --> 01:18:02,885
But the train he used to take
everyday.. he came under it and died

1137
01:18:05,294 --> 01:18:07,626
''Forget it, Kishan. There are
several stories in this slum..''

1138
01:18:07,696 --> 01:18:09,755
as many as the slums in this city

1139
01:18:10,966 --> 01:18:12,627
''And in every neighbourhood,
there's an Arjun ..''

1140
01:18:12,701 --> 01:18:15,363
.. who wants to change their destiny

1141
01:18:17,706 --> 01:18:19,173
''When in fact, he himself is unlucky''

1142
01:18:21,210 --> 01:18:25,010
''lf we are unlucky, we
need to find luck''

1143
01:18:25,981 --> 01:18:28,711
''Meaning? - When honesty
doesn't work, use lies''

1144
01:18:29,718 --> 01:18:31,743
''When you are not given
your right, snatch it''

1145
01:18:35,791 --> 01:18:37,850
''Answer the door, dear.
- Yes, father''

1146
01:18:42,731 --> 01:18:43,891
You..?
- Hi sweetheart

1147
01:18:43,966 --> 01:18:46,662
Why are you here? Father is inside.
- l can't see him

1148
01:18:46,735 --> 01:18:48,066
Shivani!
- He's calling

1149
01:18:50,239 --> 01:18:52,139
Who was it?
- Nobody

1150
01:18:52,207 --> 01:18:54,937
Who were you talking to?
- Nobody

1151
01:18:55,010 --> 01:18:59,140
''The news today was so great,
l can't stop humming it''

1152
01:18:59,848 --> 01:19:02,840
''Bees hovering, flowers blossoming''

1153
01:19:05,754 --> 01:19:08,689
''Well uncle, how are you? How's
the tap water? All okay?''

1154
01:19:08,757 --> 01:19:09,917
You?

1155
01:19:09,992 --> 01:19:13,120
What are you doing here?
Bloody motor mechanic

1156
01:19:13,195 --> 01:19:16,426
''Mr Shastri, he's with me''

1157
01:19:20,369 --> 01:19:22,428
''Arjun, how are you, son?
- First-class''

1158
01:19:23,872 --> 01:19:26,340
''How are you, Ms Sania?
- Sania?''

1159
01:19:26,775 --> 01:19:28,436
My aunt. Aunt Sunaina

1160
01:19:28,777 --> 01:19:31,769
People lovingly call her Sania

1161
01:19:31,847 --> 01:19:35,715
What are you doing here? Go and
get a Coca Cola for Ms Sania

1162
01:19:35,784 --> 01:19:36,910
Go

1163
01:19:38,887 --> 01:19:40,047
Please come

1164
01:19:46,195 --> 01:19:48,322
You got lots to do in
the garage. Go on

1165
01:19:48,397 --> 01:19:50,888
lt's a public holiday

1166
01:19:50,966 --> 01:19:52,831
''No holiday, son.''

1167
01:19:52,901 --> 01:19:54,129
Who is it?

1168
01:19:56,071 --> 01:19:57,231
He's gone

1169
01:19:58,740 --> 01:19:59,934
''No, no..''

1170
01:20:01,810 --> 01:20:04,142
''Beautiful girl, wrong address''

1171
01:20:04,213 --> 01:20:07,148
''What do you mean, Ms Sania?
- l mean..''

1172
01:20:09,084 --> 01:20:11,450
don't marry her into
any wrong address

1173
01:20:11,920 --> 01:20:15,754
''Find only a nice, inexpensive,
reliable..''

1174
01:20:15,824 --> 01:20:18,190
and an excellent quality
boy. Like Arjun

1175
01:20:18,260 --> 01:20:19,488
Like him?

1176
01:20:22,898 --> 01:20:24,889
''Yes, l'm leaving, Arjun''

1177
01:20:25,968 --> 01:20:29,768
''Where are you going, Ms Sania? -
The weather bureau has said that..''

1178
01:20:29,838 --> 01:20:33,069
the sky will be clear today. l've
put the clothes out to dry

1179
01:20:33,142 --> 01:20:36,942
They might get wet. So l'm leaving

1180
01:20:37,012 --> 01:20:40,914
Why are you leaving? Arjun will go

1181
01:20:40,983 --> 01:20:43,451
Go and get the clothes.
- Mr Shastri..

1182
01:20:44,786 --> 01:20:45,912
l..?

1183
01:20:47,923 --> 01:20:49,117
Ear

1184
01:20:49,992 --> 01:20:52,017
Ear? Okay

1185
01:20:52,861 --> 01:20:55,352
lt won't be nice if Arjun
handles those clothes

1186
01:20:55,430 --> 01:20:56,863
What clothes?

1187
01:20:57,799 --> 01:20:58,993
l got it

1188
01:20:59,067 --> 01:21:03,970
Shivani

1189
01:21:05,874 --> 01:21:08,434
''Go and get Ms Sania's clothes,
they might get wet''

1190
01:21:11,280 --> 01:21:13,111
''Yes..? Yes, let's go, Shivani''

1191
01:21:13,182 --> 01:21:16,879
''Where are you going?
- The keys are with me, aunt''

1192
01:21:16,952 --> 01:21:20,513
''And yes Arjun, iron all
the clothes carefully''

1193
01:21:20,889 --> 01:21:23,255
Shall l arrange it in the wardrobe?
- Thank you

1194
01:21:23,325 --> 01:21:26,419
''Okay. Okay, Mr Shastri.
- No, don't go''

1195
01:21:26,895 --> 01:21:29,955
Why are you spying on
your own daughter?

1196
01:21:30,032 --> 01:21:33,001
She's young and innocent.. what
if she gets carried away?

1197
01:21:33,068 --> 01:21:37,971
''Mr Shastri, not essentially
the young and the innocent''

1198
01:21:38,974 --> 01:21:40,965
Even the wizened get carried away

1199
01:21:42,511 --> 01:21:44,206
l hope you're not talking about me?

1200
01:21:44,279 --> 01:21:45,371
No

1201
01:21:47,182 --> 01:21:48,342
About both of us

1202
01:22:09,004 --> 01:22:10,198
Damn

1203
01:22:25,887 --> 01:22:27,047
Damn

1204
01:22:39,968 --> 01:22:41,094
Shivani..

1205
01:23:00,522 --> 01:23:02,990
The transgression..

1206
01:23:04,493 --> 01:23:07,428
of the eyes..

1207
01:23:07,496 --> 01:23:09,396
be forgiven

1208
01:23:12,567 --> 01:23:15,365
lt just watches you

1209
01:23:16,538 --> 01:23:19,996
What the lips can't speak..

1210
01:23:20,075 --> 01:23:23,238
the eyes express

1211
01:23:24,513 --> 01:23:26,378
of the eyes..

1212
01:23:28,483 --> 01:23:31,043
The shyness..

1213
01:23:34,022 --> 01:23:35,148
''No, no!''

1214
01:23:36,358 --> 01:23:38,417
''Great going, aunt''

1215
01:23:38,493 --> 01:23:42,122
''You've fixed your game too,
along with Arjun''

1216
01:23:42,197 --> 01:23:45,496
Keep it up.
- l'm keeping it up

1217
01:23:45,567 --> 01:23:47,694
''Aunt, your oranges''

1218
01:23:48,537 --> 01:23:51,028
Orange juice. You wanted it

1219
01:23:51,106 --> 01:23:52,403
''Oh, orange juice''

1220
01:23:53,542 --> 01:23:55,271
Sorry..
- lt's okay

1221
01:23:55,344 --> 01:23:57,107
''ln trying to save the oranges,
l spilled the juice''

1222
01:24:09,057 --> 01:24:11,617
''So aunt, Arjun said this is the
first time you've come to Mumbai''

1223
01:24:16,598 --> 01:24:17,656
F and S are fine

1224
01:24:18,066 --> 01:24:22,469
''Julie, didn't anyone tell
you you are very pretty?''

1225
01:24:23,071 --> 01:24:25,733
''Aunt, no one dares''

1226
01:24:26,074 --> 01:24:27,666
Someone must've dared

1227
01:24:29,277 --> 01:24:30,403
''Yes, he did''

1228
01:24:31,079 --> 01:24:33,479
You must be knowing him. Arjun's..

1229
01:24:33,548 --> 01:24:36,711
''scoundrel.. l mean, cousin''

1230
01:24:37,085 --> 01:24:38,211
Kishan

1231
01:24:39,621 --> 01:24:42,522
''Kishan, the handsome!''

1232
01:24:45,627 --> 01:24:47,322
Kishan is handsome?

1233
01:24:48,530 --> 01:24:52,364
''Aunt, your choice is so bad.
Look at that priest''

1234
01:24:56,438 --> 01:24:58,531
You dislike Kishan?
- What else?

1235
01:24:58,607 --> 01:25:02,043
How'd you feel when a boy kisses
you on the first meeting itself?

1236
01:25:02,110 --> 01:25:03,737
Nice

1237
01:25:06,114 --> 01:25:10,744
''l mean, l'll feel he's honest.
l'll feel he really loves me''

1238
01:25:12,187 --> 01:25:15,122
''Perhaps Kishan loves..
- No, aunt''

1239
01:25:16,258 --> 01:25:20,718
''lt wasn't love. Had it been love,
guitars would've sounded''

1240
01:25:22,464 --> 01:25:25,126
''Guitars?
- Yes, guitars''

1241
01:25:25,200 --> 01:25:26,258
''Mummy used to tell
me that if someone,''

1242
01:25:26,334 --> 01:25:32,432
''who loves you dearly, kisses you,
guitars will play in your heart''

1243
01:25:34,142 --> 01:25:36,702
But it didn't. So l slapped him

1244
01:25:40,482 --> 01:25:42,643
What if the guitar plays?

1245
01:25:42,717 --> 01:25:45,777
How can it play now? Kishan has gone

1246
01:25:46,254 --> 01:25:47,380
He can come back

1247
01:25:48,089 --> 01:25:49,283
How?

1248
01:25:51,159 --> 01:25:54,094
''lf someone is really
in love with you,''

1249
01:25:54,162 --> 01:25:59,464
close your eyes and remember him.
He'll be right before you

1250
01:25:59,534 --> 01:26:02,367
Who told you that?
- Did you alone have a mummy?

1251
01:26:03,638 --> 01:26:08,701
''My mummy used to say that
sometimes. C'mon, close your eyes''

1252
01:26:09,511 --> 01:26:11,741
Julie aunty

1253
01:26:11,813 --> 01:26:13,440
''Close your eyes, please''

''your name, my love''

1271

''it'll be for an evening
of lovemaking''

Sway! Let me sway in your arms

A sprain?

How'll l dance now?

''Your brains are punctured,

01:32:13,608 --> 01:32:16,634
Fast old man!
- Did you say something?

1317
01:32:16,711 --> 01:32:19,805
Why don't you put it on me..

''Had l known earlier, l'd have
bought something else''

1322

1330
01:33:06,594 --> 01:33:07,720

01:33:22,043 --> 01:33:23,601
Small?

1337
01:33:25,880 --> 01:33:26,972
Sorry

Swine! l'll feed you grams
and whip your butt

1345
01:33:55,910 --> 01:33:57,878
Glory to Sarkar

01:34:00,581 --> 01:34:01,741
Hands up!

Give me the bag!
- What bag?

1353
01:34:16,998 --> 01:34:20,729
Sania is written on it!
- l don't have any bag like that

1354
01:34:20,802 --> 01:34:24,761
Sweetheart! Explain

1355
01:34:24,839 --> 01:34:28,297
''Else, l'll shoot you!
- Mr Shastri, please save me''

1356
01:34:28,676 --> 01:34:31,611
Don't you dare touch my Sania!

1357
01:34:31,679 --> 01:34:32,873
Sania?

01:34:42,123 --> 01:34:45,320
''No one can kidnap Sania,
when l'm around''

1362
01:34:49,197 --> 01:34:51,757
''Sania, l'm leaving''

1363
01:34:51,833 --> 01:34:53,994
Mr Shastri.. are you all right?

1364
01:34:54,702 --> 01:34:58,798
''Let him go!
- Please save me, Mr Shastri..''

1365
01:35:00,975 --> 01:35:02,772
''Watchman, where are you going?
- l'm not Sania..''

1366
01:35:02,844 --> 01:35:05,039
Watchman? Do l look like a watchman?

1367
01:35:05,113 --> 01:35:07,172
''Where's 6, Alvaris House?''

Hello? Want to be my pillion?

''Mane darling, can't
you drive faster?''

1376
01:35:39,947 --> 01:35:42,381
Even bicycles are overtaking us

1377
01:35:42,817 --> 01:35:45,377
lt's a police vehicle.
lt's used to chasing

''Kishan is not here, Mr Rana''

1379
01:35:48,823 --> 01:35:52,782
Not inside this either.

1380
01:35:52,860 --> 01:35:56,193
''Get up, old fossil. Where's Kishan?''

1381
01:35:57,865 --> 01:35:59,025
''Mr Rana, there's no water in the
glass.''

1382
01:35:59,100 --> 01:36:00,328
Why didn't you tell me before?

Hands up

''Hey Nepalese, hands up.

1386
01:36:08,709 --> 01:36:09,903
Because..

1393
01:36:28,896 --> 01:36:31,729
But why?

1394
01:36:31,799 --> 01:36:33,790
''Or, you die young. Move it''

1395
01:36:33,868 --> 01:36:36,132

''Sania, l'm coming''

01:36:46,814 --> 01:36:49,339
''Promise me, you won't leave me''

1401
01:36:49,417 --> 01:36:51,282
Tell her not to leave..

1402

1403
01:36:57,258 --> 01:36:59,089
''Not her, not her either.

1404
01:36:59,160 --> 01:37:01,924
''where's aunt?
- What happened, father?''

1405
01:37:01,996 --> 01:37:06,126
Some men came and..

1406
01:37:06,200 --> 01:37:09,260
kidnapped Sania.
- Sania?

1407
01:37:09,337 --> 01:37:11,168
Kishan?
- Kishan?

1408
01:37:13,241 --> 01:37:16,267
Kishan.. Krishna!
- Who'd have kidnapped aunt?

1409
01:37:16,344 --> 01:37:19,871
Some punks. They spoke about killing

1410
01:37:19,947 --> 01:37:23,474
They were asking about a bag.
- What bag?

1411
01:37:23,918 --> 01:37:26,318
''That carried the address,
6, Alvaris House''

1412
01:37:26,988 --> 01:37:30,890
''The bag that Sarju Maharaj brought?
- Yes, that's the one''

1413
01:37:30,958 --> 01:37:33,017
Then find the bag.
- Come on

1414
01:37:35,863 --> 01:37:38,195
''l remember!
- Where is it, father?''

1415
01:37:38,266 --> 01:37:41,292
Tell us.
- Your dog came in

1416
01:37:41,369 --> 01:37:45,863
He picked up my mug and barked at me

1417
01:37:48,009 --> 01:37:51,911
''l lost my temper, picked up the
bag and ran towards him..''

1418
01:37:53,981 --> 01:37:55,278
''he barked, l lost it''

1419
01:38:02,957 --> 01:38:05,448
What have you done?
- Mr Shastri!

1420
01:38:05,993 --> 01:38:08,985
Only Badshah can tell
us where the bag is

1421
01:38:09,063 --> 01:38:12,260
Badshah!

1422
01:38:13,167 --> 01:38:14,498
Sania!

1423
01:38:17,905 --> 01:38:20,840
''Trying to lure me? lf
you challenge me,''

1424
01:38:20,908 --> 01:38:24,366
''you'll face it for nine months,
without a hospital''

1425
01:38:24,912 --> 01:38:28,473
''Why did we get her here, brother?
Doesn't Carlos want her?''

1426
01:38:28,549 --> 01:38:30,949
Moron. She has diamonds
worth 500 million

1427
01:38:31,018 --> 01:38:35,011
Don't we deserve at least
5 million? - 5 million?

1428
01:38:35,089 --> 01:38:39,992
''lf we get 5 million, we'll buy a
DVD player. Hiring one everyday..''

1429
01:38:40,061 --> 01:38:44,361
is disgusting.
- Your thinking is so low

1430
01:38:44,432 --> 01:38:49,369
We'll buy a multiplex theatre and
watch the film made on myself..

1431
01:38:49,437 --> 01:38:52,497
''Little Don
- Brother, we'll also buy a real gun''

1432
01:38:52,573 --> 01:38:55,599
My nephew cries for it everyday.
lt's disgusting

1433
01:38:56,043 --> 01:38:58,944
''Of course, l'll buy a real
gun and try it on you first''

1434
01:39:01,382 --> 01:39:03,213
''Come, sir. Look''

1435
01:39:04,285 --> 01:39:05,513
Here's Sarju

1436
01:39:06,153 --> 01:39:07,313
''So you are Sarju, eh?''

1437
01:39:10,291 --> 01:39:11,383
One minute

1438
01:39:15,963 --> 01:39:18,056
''What happened?
- Mane, it's not Sarju''

1439
01:39:18,132 --> 01:39:19,360
l am Sarju

1440
01:39:19,967 --> 01:39:23,027
Why isn't he Sarju?
- Aren't you Sarju?

1441
01:39:23,104 --> 01:39:25,402
''Speak!
- l agree, you hit me''

1442
01:39:25,473 --> 01:39:28,203
''l refuse, you still hit me.
Ladies, gentlemen,''

1443
01:39:28,276 --> 01:39:30,904
decide when you'll hit me..

1444
01:39:30,978 --> 01:39:32,969
''Shut up, oldie!''

1445
01:39:33,047 --> 01:39:36,039
''Hey, where's the original Sarju?''

1446
01:39:36,117 --> 01:39:38,551
Are you trying to con
me with a xerox?

1447
01:39:38,986 --> 01:39:41,284
''He's the Sarju we have, sir''

1448
01:39:42,990 --> 01:39:44,355
''Mane, it's not Sarju..''

1449
01:39:44,425 --> 01:39:46,985
in whose bag l kept diamonds
worth 500 million

1450
01:39:47,061 --> 01:39:48,358
''Shut up, radio''

1451
01:39:50,531 --> 01:39:52,089
500 million in diamonds!

1452
01:39:54,001 --> 01:39:56,060
''Brother, what do we do now?
- Phone''

1453
01:39:56,137 --> 01:39:57,934
Back home? Shall l tell
mother that l'll be late?

1454
01:39:58,005 --> 01:39:59,495
No

1455
01:40:02,276 --> 01:40:03,607
Don't screw my mind

1456
01:40:05,012 --> 01:40:08,106
''One phone to Carlos, and
our lives will change''

1457
01:40:11,052 --> 01:40:13,020
''Give me your phone, l got no
balance.''

1458
01:40:13,087 --> 01:40:15,021
Just give him a missed call..

1459
01:40:15,089 --> 01:40:18,081
''all right, call him. lf he
puts you on hold, hang up''

1460
01:40:30,204 --> 01:40:34,698
Carlos.. Mata Prasad Bhate speaking

1461
01:40:35,142 --> 01:40:37,975
''Mata, l'll juice you! Where's Sania?''

1462
01:40:38,045 --> 01:40:39,239
With me

1463
01:40:39,313 --> 01:40:42,976
''Bring her over. l'm here, in lndia''

1464
01:40:43,050 --> 01:40:44,677
Reached already?

1465
01:40:46,320 --> 01:40:48,049
You are amazing

1466
01:40:49,590 --> 01:40:51,683
But you won't get Sania

1467
01:40:51,992 --> 01:40:53,186
Meaning?

1468
01:40:53,260 --> 01:40:56,388
The girl has 500 million in diamonds

1469
01:40:56,464 --> 01:41:00,594
l should at least get 5 million

1470
01:41:01,335 --> 01:41:03,235
The phone!
- What did you say?

1471
01:41:03,304 --> 01:41:06,273
l should at least get 5 million

1472
01:41:08,142 --> 01:41:11,168
lt's a very small amount.
The girl is so heavy..

1473
01:41:11,245 --> 01:41:15,409
''l had to borrow 10,000 bucks''

1474
01:41:15,483 --> 01:41:18,179
You will get a PDC.
- PDC?

1475
01:41:19,487 --> 01:41:22,012
''ln five days, moron''

1476
01:41:22,089 --> 01:41:23,522
Cheque

1477
01:41:26,293 --> 01:41:29,751
''Was he afraid, brother?
- That's Little Don's forte''

1478
01:41:31,098 --> 01:41:34,090
''The day l was born, doctors
and nurses were scared''

1479
01:41:34,168 --> 01:41:36,102
The ward boy fainted

1480
01:41:37,238 --> 01:41:40,674
''Janta Prasad, stay here,
while l get the money''

1481
01:41:45,379 --> 01:41:46,471
lmmoral!

1482
01:41:47,314 --> 01:41:51,114
''Keep an eye on her, and
don't fall for her words''

1483
01:41:51,185 --> 01:41:54,712
''l don't like when women speak,
l like the nights with them''

1484
01:41:55,222 --> 01:41:57,247
There's still time for the night

1485
01:41:57,324 --> 01:41:59,224
lt's nighttime

1486
01:42:14,208 --> 01:42:18,770
Damn! l got it now. The ass took
this old man for Sarju. Old fossil!

1487
01:42:19,146 --> 01:42:23,139
''Which means, the guy in
the train was Kishan''

1488
01:42:24,418 --> 01:42:26,545
You mean Kishan got there..
- Where Sarju had to!

1489
01:42:26,620 --> 01:42:31,148
''Oh my God! lt means, the fake Sarju
is in the slums with the bag''

1490
01:42:31,225 --> 01:42:34,786
''Mane, let's go, fast.
Carlos, diamonds..''

1491
01:42:35,429 --> 01:42:38,830
Why do you mention Carlos and
the diamonds before everyone?

1492
01:42:39,166 --> 01:42:41,157
And why did you tell
him the address?

1493
01:42:41,235 --> 01:42:44,227
How was l to know that l
was going to ditch him?

1494
01:42:44,305 --> 01:42:45,602
Let's go

1495
01:42:45,673 --> 01:42:48,164
''Swine, if you..''

1496
01:42:48,242 --> 01:42:49,834
He speaks Nepalese?

1497
01:42:51,545 --> 01:42:55,345
''lf you follow me, not one bullet,
l'll empty the entire gun on you''

1498
01:42:56,450 --> 01:42:57,815
l'll use the kukri

1499
01:42:59,653 --> 01:43:02,622
''Rana, what's all this?
- lt's a huge scam''

1500
01:43:03,190 --> 01:43:06,523
''lf you listen to it, you will faint''

1501
01:43:07,194 --> 01:43:11,688
Just imagine that you've won the
Great Nepal lottery in Mumbai

1502
01:43:11,765 --> 01:43:13,858
Where?
- Here

1503
01:43:16,203 --> 01:43:18,262
Sania forgot her phone

1504
01:43:19,473 --> 01:43:21,532
Now watch what Kukri don does

1505
01:43:24,545 --> 01:43:25,637
Sania!

1506
01:43:27,314 --> 01:43:32,149
''Sania, l knew you'd give
Mata the slip and call me''

1507
01:43:32,219 --> 01:43:34,653
''Where are you?
- Sania is with me, Mr Carlos''

1508
01:43:34,722 --> 01:43:36,485
''Watchman, give the phone to the lady''

1509
01:43:38,425 --> 01:43:42,589
''l'm not a watchman. l'm Rana,
Kukri gang's boss''

1510
01:43:42,663 --> 01:43:43,891
And Sania..

1511
01:43:46,233 --> 01:43:47,359
is with me

1512
01:43:47,434 --> 01:43:50,232
How did you get Sania?
- Forget it

1513
01:43:50,304 --> 01:43:53,364
Just think of a way
to have Sania back

1514
01:43:53,440 --> 01:43:57,536
l want 5 million for Sania

1515
01:43:57,611 --> 01:43:59,476
5 million..?

1516
01:44:00,681 --> 01:44:05,584
Think it over. Only Sania can lead
you to the diamonds worth 500 million

1517
01:44:05,653 --> 01:44:06,881
And Sania..

1518
01:44:09,256 --> 01:44:10,382
is with me

1519
01:44:11,258 --> 01:44:12,350
''Okay, okay''

1520
01:44:13,327 --> 01:44:15,420
''Bring her over, l'll pay you''

1521
01:44:15,496 --> 01:44:17,862
No way. l'll come first

1522
01:44:18,465 --> 01:44:21,662
''After l get the money, my men
will hand Sania over to you''

1523
01:44:21,735 --> 01:44:24,203
Send me your address via text
message on this phone

1524
01:44:24,271 --> 01:44:25,863
Send the address

1525
01:44:28,375 --> 01:44:30,935
How can Sania be in the custody
of two different men?

1526
01:44:32,346 --> 01:44:33,745
''Can l say something, sir?
- Yes''

1527
01:44:34,281 --> 01:44:37,375
One of them is lying.
- Then where is Sania?

1528
01:44:37,451 --> 01:44:39,942
l know.
- Where?

1529
01:44:40,421 --> 01:44:41,615
With one of them

1530
01:44:43,490 --> 01:44:46,653
''Rana, great mind!
5 million at one go''

1531
01:44:48,862 --> 01:44:52,525
''Kacha, China.. you read half the
address, you read the other half''

1532
01:44:52,600 --> 01:44:57,299
''And the rest, ask someone else.
Pick up Sania and get her there''

1533
01:44:57,371 --> 01:44:59,862
l'm going to get the money.
- But sir..

1534
01:45:00,574 --> 01:45:04,476
where do we leave him?
- Leave him to his fate

1535
01:46:09,843 --> 01:46:10,935
Brother!

1536
01:46:15,382 --> 01:46:16,872
Sania! 500 million

1537
01:46:20,921 --> 01:46:22,513
What's this? Hey!

1538
01:46:32,733 --> 01:46:34,758
Our dream..

1539
01:46:34,835 --> 01:46:37,497
our dream money-money

1540
01:46:37,571 --> 01:46:39,539
Our dream money-money

1541
01:46:39,606 --> 01:46:41,665
Our dream money-money

1542
01:46:41,742 --> 01:46:43,767
Our dream money-money

1543
01:46:43,844 --> 01:46:46,039
Our dream money-money

1544
01:46:46,513 --> 01:46:48,538
Our dream money-money

1545
01:46:48,615 --> 01:46:51,083
Everyone wants money..

1546
01:46:51,418 --> 01:46:53,511
Everyone wants money..

1547
01:46:53,587 --> 01:46:55,987
Father.. over here.
- l got it!

1548
01:46:56,423 --> 01:46:58,414
My mug!

1549
01:46:58,492 --> 01:47:00,585
We want money..

1550
01:47:00,661 --> 01:47:02,561
our dream

1551
01:47:02,629 --> 01:47:04,927
Our dream money-money

1552
01:47:04,998 --> 01:47:07,091
Our dream money-money

1553
01:47:07,501 --> 01:47:09,833
Our dream money-money

1554
01:47:09,903 --> 01:47:11,871
l got the bag

1555
01:47:13,373 --> 01:47:14,567
Found it

1556
01:47:14,641 --> 01:47:17,109
Found it. Disperse

1557
01:47:19,713 --> 01:47:22,546
Now we can all find Ms Sania

1558
01:47:22,616 --> 01:47:24,106
Help!

1559
01:47:24,551 --> 01:47:26,451
What happened?
- Aunt!

1560
01:47:43,470 --> 01:47:47,531
''Ms Sania, l loved the ride.
l was coming to rescue you''

1561

Rescue me? l can beat

01:47:50,544 --> 01:47:52,603
Give me the bag.

1563
01:47:52,679 --> 01:47:55,842
l'll tell you later.

1564
01:47:55,916 --> 01:47:57,907
Stop! Stop!

1565
01:48:00,487 --> 01:48:01,749

''Bag! - You missed me, sir.
Single ldli Singh''

1577
01:48:26,446 --> 01:48:27,640
My child

1578
01:48:35,522 --> 01:48:36,580
One minute

1579
01:48:39,626 --> 01:48:40,786
Where to?

1580
01:48:40,861 --> 01:48:43,625
Hey hero.. smartass

1581
01:48:58,812 --> 01:48:59,972
Give him the bag

1582
01:49:02,616 --> 01:49:03,708
The bag

1583
01:49:03,784 --> 01:49:07,481
Throw it.
- Give it to him

1584
01:49:07,554 --> 01:49:08,714
The bag

Yes. Let's go

1588
01:49:21,635 --> 01:49:24,001
Don't inform the cops.
- But you said..

1589
01:49:24,071 --> 01:49:26,505
He said he's a cop.
- Exactly

1590
01:49:26,573 --> 01:49:29,201
No need to inform them. l know

''l'm Mane, smartass''

1592
01:49:32,145 --> 01:49:34,613
Cops after a bag?
What does it carry?

1593
01:49:36,984 --> 01:49:38,849
''Cry all you want, then speak''

1594
01:49:38,919 --> 01:49:40,648
What's inside it?

1595
01:49:44,191 --> 01:49:46,682
All of you want to know?
- Yes aunt. Tell us

1596
01:49:49,129 --> 01:49:50,187
Diamonds worth 500 million

1597
01:49:50,597 --> 01:49:51,928
500 million..?

1598
01:49:51,999 --> 01:49:53,057
500 million?
- 500..

1599
01:49:53,133 --> 01:49:54,191
million!

1600
01:49:54,268 --> 01:49:57,169
''500 million, did she say?
- Yes, 500 million''

1601
01:49:57,237 --> 01:49:59,205
''Had you known before,
you wouldn't give it''

1602
01:50:02,609 --> 01:50:05,942
''Let alone 500 million, l'd even
sacrifice 5 billion for Shivani''

1603
01:50:26,900 --> 01:50:28,060
''You'll commend me, sir''

1604
01:50:32,072 --> 01:50:33,164
Quiet

1605
01:50:34,174 --> 01:50:37,769
''You'll commend me, sir.
You never believed me''

1606
01:50:37,844 --> 01:50:41,678
''l'll prove that the things you turned
me down for were so ''maningful''

1607
01:50:41,748 --> 01:50:43,739
Meaningful!
- Meaningful

1608
01:50:43,817 --> 01:50:44,909
Wonderful

1609
01:50:46,653 --> 01:50:49,645
''Silence! What wonderful?
This is a police station,''

1610
01:50:49,723 --> 01:50:52,590
''not a musical stage?
- Sir, this bag carries..''

1611
01:50:52,659 --> 01:50:57,323
diamonds worth 500 million. This
girl smuggled it in from Goa

1612
01:50:58,699 --> 01:51:03,602
''Ma'am, l never wanted my uniform
stained, so l never befriended..''

1613
01:51:03,670 --> 01:51:08,733
a betel-leaf chewer or vendor.
l ate food meant for dogs

1614
01:51:08,809 --> 01:51:12,973
But l never took bribe. l'm a
spotless and sincere officer

1615
01:51:13,046 --> 01:51:14,741
You will also agree..

1616
01:51:20,687 --> 01:51:22,621
''Sir, the common man
earns a salary..''

1617
01:51:22,689 --> 01:51:23,951
What?

1618
01:51:25,692 --> 01:51:26,852
''God! Sorry, sir''

1619
01:51:28,028 --> 01:51:32,761
A policeman's salary is not more
than what an ordinary man pays as tax

1620
01:51:33,967 --> 01:51:37,164
''And for a paltry salary,
we work tediously..''

1621
01:51:37,237 --> 01:51:38,704
besides..

1622
01:51:39,706 --> 01:51:40,934
the blood boils

1623
01:51:41,008 --> 01:51:43,875
''My blood too boiled today,''

1624
01:51:43,944 --> 01:51:45,309
and l spoke

1625
01:51:47,047 --> 01:51:49,015
''Appreciation, sir''

1626
01:51:49,082 --> 01:51:51,380
Won't you open the bag?

1627
01:51:51,985 --> 01:51:53,145
''Yes, sir''

1628
01:52:00,293 --> 01:52:03,785
''What's this?
- Scandal, sir''

1629
01:52:03,864 --> 01:52:05,923
''All the best, sir.
- Thank you''

1630
01:52:09,970 --> 01:52:12,666
''You are right, Mane. lt
has the very stuff..''

1631
01:52:12,739 --> 01:52:14,730
''that's on your mind.
- Thank you, sir''

1632
01:52:14,808 --> 01:52:16,002
''What, sir?
- Nothing!''

1633
01:52:16,076 --> 01:52:17,134
Duffer

1634
01:52:21,014 --> 01:52:22,879
''You are right, Commissioner''

1635
01:52:22,949 --> 01:52:26,851
Your officer has lost
his mental stability

1636
01:52:26,920 --> 01:52:31,948
''He kidnapped me, forced the
bag on me and brought me here''

1637
01:52:32,025 --> 01:52:35,188
No sir..
- l wish l could fire him

1638
01:52:35,262 --> 01:52:39,130
Let the police do the noble deed

1639
01:52:40,033 --> 01:52:41,694
You may please leave

1640
01:52:41,768 --> 01:52:43,030
''Thank you, sir''

1641
01:52:55,215 --> 01:52:57,376
''Come in, come in''

1642
01:52:57,784 --> 01:52:58,944
What do you want?

1643
01:52:59,019 --> 01:53:01,249
She works for Carlos

1644
01:53:01,321 --> 01:53:04,290
And you used to work
for the police force

1645
01:53:04,357 --> 01:53:06,723
''Believe me, sir. The diamonds
were in this box,''

1646
01:53:06,793 --> 01:53:09,421
''which was in the bag, and
the bag was in the slums''

1647
01:53:09,863 --> 01:53:11,888
''l tell you, the diamonds
are in the slums..''

1648
01:53:20,907 --> 01:53:22,067
''l found it, sir''

1649
01:53:25,011 --> 01:53:26,979
''l got the entire circle.
- You will get it,''

1650
01:53:27,047 --> 01:53:32,144
''the entire circle, for yourself.
You will beg at King's Circle''

1651
01:53:32,919 --> 01:53:38,050
''Borkar, get him off my back.
Prepare his suspension order''

1652
01:53:42,229 --> 01:53:44,129
And send them all to the Andamans!

1653
01:53:45,098 --> 01:53:46,326
Sorry sir

1654
01:53:47,334 --> 01:53:48,426
Forgive me

1655
01:53:50,403 --> 01:53:52,769
''Sorry..
- To begin with, l'll give you alms''

1656
01:53:52,839 --> 01:53:53,965
l will

1657
01:53:56,443 --> 01:53:58,934
''Apologise to him, please
sir. Please sir''

1658
01:53:59,012 --> 01:54:01,981
What's my name? - lnspector
Namane (Namane - Disagree)

1659
01:54:03,950 --> 01:54:05,042
l disagree

1660
01:54:05,852 --> 01:54:07,979
Your name?
- Will you hit me if l tell you?

1661
01:54:08,054 --> 01:54:10,921
Why'd l hit you?
- Finally l've found a gentleman

1662
01:54:10,991 --> 01:54:13,960
''My name is Sarju Maharaj,
Banaraswala. -''

1663
01:54:14,027 --> 01:54:16,791
''Then foot the bill. 140,000 bucks''

1664
01:54:16,863 --> 01:54:18,228
''140,000..?''

1665
01:54:18,298 --> 01:54:21,495
''140,000 for a biscuit? Are
you selling me the factory?''

1666
01:54:22,002 --> 01:54:25,165
''The fun you had here,
you called in girls..''

1667
01:54:25,238 --> 01:54:29,140
who'll foot the bill for it?
- l'm not Sarju Maharaj

1668
01:54:30,110 --> 01:54:32,874
Chintu! Montu! We got
a new servant here

1669
01:54:32,946 --> 01:54:34,106
Servant? Who?

1670
01:54:40,954 --> 01:54:42,148
lt's an embarrassing story

1671
01:54:42,222 --> 01:54:44,520
lt's a pain in my nose

1672
01:54:46,259 --> 01:54:48,819
l got nothing marrying the
boy my father chose..

1673
01:54:48,895 --> 01:54:50,988
''but a drunkard, lousy husband''

1674
01:54:51,064 --> 01:54:53,532
He'd throw lit cigarettes on me

1675
01:54:54,334 --> 01:54:56,427
l got so many scars on my chest.
- Show me

1676
01:54:56,903 --> 01:54:58,029
At leisure

1677
01:54:59,439 --> 01:55:00,565
l'm at peaceful leisure

1678
01:55:00,907 --> 01:55:03,899
''Forget about yourself, think
about your daughter''

1679
01:55:03,977 --> 01:55:08,539
Do you want Shivani to
face what l have faced?

1680
01:55:08,915 --> 01:55:12,851
Never!
- Then don't stop two beating hearts

1681
01:55:12,919 --> 01:55:14,181
Don't stop

1682
01:55:15,355 --> 01:55:18,381
Marry Shivani off to Arjun. Please

1683
01:55:20,460 --> 01:55:23,054
l too need something in return

1684
01:55:25,031 --> 01:55:26,123
What?

1685
01:55:26,199 --> 01:55:27,564
Your hand

1686
01:55:29,269 --> 01:55:32,500
That's not my hand.
- l know

1687
01:55:38,044 --> 01:55:39,170
will you marry me?

1688
01:55:39,246 --> 01:55:40,372
No

1689
01:55:43,216 --> 01:55:46,879
''Yes Shivani. The one your father
has lost his heart to, is not my aunt''

1690
01:55:46,953 --> 01:55:48,318
lt's Kishan

1691
01:55:49,222 --> 01:55:50,382
lmpossible

1692
01:55:50,457 --> 01:55:53,949
She has given in! She agreed

1693
01:55:54,027 --> 01:55:57,428
She agreed

1694
01:55:59,966 --> 01:56:04,130
''Shivani, Sania is
willing to marry me''

1695
01:56:04,204 --> 01:56:07,469
''You've got a new mother.
- No, it's not possible, Mr Shastri''

1696
01:56:08,074 --> 01:56:11,009
lt's against nature.
- l've changed my own nature

1697
01:56:11,077 --> 01:56:13,637
Alvaris House will have two weddings

1698
01:56:13,980 --> 01:56:16,073
Mine and yours

1699
01:56:16,149 --> 01:56:18,447
''l'll give your hand away,
you give your father away''

1700
01:56:18,518 --> 01:56:21,043
''But listen to me, father..
- Not a word''

1701
01:56:21,121 --> 01:56:26,991
Better to paint your heart with
love than live all by yourself

1702
01:56:27,060 --> 01:56:31,360
l now realise that one who wins the
game of love is really a winner

1703
01:56:31,431 --> 01:56:36,994
l have a found my idol l've
been waiting for eons

1704
01:56:37,070 --> 01:56:39,937
Those are Amir Khan's movies.
- Exactly. The revolutionary

1705
01:56:40,006 --> 01:56:41,132
Father..

1706
01:56:43,343 --> 01:56:46,107
My sweetheart chews betel-leaf

1707
01:56:48,014 --> 01:56:51,074
''The handsome macho's
lips turn crimson''

1708
01:56:51,151 --> 01:56:54,552
Oh the silken 'kurta..

1709
01:56:56,056 --> 01:56:59,651
''The red spots on
the silken 'kurta'..''

1710
01:57:00,427 --> 01:57:03,453
My father has had 51 vitalizing
betel-leaves

1711
01:57:05,365 --> 01:57:06,627
What have you done?

1712
01:57:07,133 --> 01:57:11,035
''Why did you agree to marry him?
- Had l refused, you wouldn't marry''

1713
01:57:11,104 --> 01:57:15,131
And what do l tell everyone? My
fiance is someone else's fiancee?

1714
01:57:15,208 --> 01:57:17,142
Father!
- Let's call an ambulance

1715
01:57:17,210 --> 01:57:21,476
lmagine. Shastri takes the veil off
his wife during the nuptial-night..

1716
01:57:21,548 --> 01:57:24,449
The veil is fine. What if he
takes off something else?

1717
01:57:24,517 --> 01:57:26,417
Father!
- Father

1718
01:57:27,987 --> 01:57:29,181
Father

1719
01:57:29,255 --> 01:57:30,313
''My child, it's me''

1720
01:57:33,059 --> 01:57:35,050
Not mine!
- Then whose father is he?

1721
01:57:35,128 --> 01:57:38,461
Might be someone's. Why care?
Think about her father

1722
01:57:39,499 --> 01:57:41,990
''Sania, my child.. it's me''

1723
01:57:42,068 --> 01:57:43,194
lt's me

1724
01:57:44,604 --> 01:57:47,300
Why did you go away? Where
did you go away?

1725
01:57:48,641 --> 01:57:52,509
''My dear glasses, my dear pot, l
have bathed since you left, dear''

1726
01:57:52,579 --> 01:57:55,139
''l mean, l haven't eaten''

1727
01:57:55,215 --> 01:57:58,742
You are mistaken.
- l'm not mistaken

1728
01:57:59,185 --> 01:58:02,154
''l'm your father, you are my daughter''

1729
01:58:02,222 --> 01:58:05,089
l'm a self-made item!
- What item?

1730
01:58:05,158 --> 01:58:09,492
For 9 months l have nourished
you in my womb

1731
01:58:09,562 --> 01:58:11,189
''l mean, your mother did''

1732
01:58:11,264 --> 01:58:13,027
Don't say that. Come to me.
- Look..

1733
01:58:13,099 --> 01:58:14,760
Uncle..

1734
01:58:17,103 --> 01:58:19,264
''What ''my-child''? Lay off''

1735
01:58:20,373 --> 01:58:21,431
l'm not Sania..

1736
01:58:21,508 --> 01:58:22,566
''Kishan, right?''

1737
01:58:24,110 --> 01:58:26,271
''First you disguised
as Sarju Maharaj,''

1738
01:58:26,346 --> 01:58:29,372
then as Sania

1739
01:58:31,117 --> 01:58:33,779
And you are marrying
Shastri tomorrow

1740
01:58:36,523 --> 01:58:39,686
''l'm beginning to understand
the farce, Kishan''

1741
01:58:39,759 --> 01:58:41,317
Who are you?
- l..?

1742
01:58:48,067 --> 01:58:49,261
Mane?

1743
01:58:49,335 --> 01:58:50,461
Namane

1744
01:58:52,138 --> 01:58:53,628
lnspector Namane

1745
01:58:55,475 --> 01:58:58,069
Why this disguise even after
getting 500 million?

1746
01:58:58,144 --> 01:58:59,805
Set up a drama company?

1747
01:59:00,079 --> 01:59:01,273
Rascal

1748
01:59:02,148 --> 01:59:04,139
You gave me an empty bag.
- What do you mean?

1749
01:59:04,217 --> 01:59:05,377
Where're the sandals?
- What sandals?

1750
01:59:05,452 --> 01:59:07,249
lt was in the box.
- What box?

1751
01:59:07,320 --> 01:59:10,517
lt was in the bag.
- We gave you the bag

1752
01:59:10,590 --> 01:59:15,220
But the diamonds worth 500 million
in the sandals weren't found

1753
01:59:15,295 --> 01:59:16,557
Sandals?

1754
01:59:23,436 --> 01:59:24,630
l gave them to Shivani

1755
01:59:26,506 --> 01:59:27,666
l gave it to father

1756
01:59:29,442 --> 01:59:30,602
And her father..

1757
01:59:51,364 --> 01:59:53,798
l have Sania.
- Exactly. l have Sania

1758
01:59:53,867 --> 01:59:56,768
l have Sania!
- l have Sania

1759
01:59:56,836 --> 02:00:00,567
''Can't you recognise a face, swine?
Are you Nepalese? Japanese? Chinese?''

1760
02:00:00,640 --> 02:00:03,803
Bloody ghost!
- l'll drive this into you

1761
02:00:03,877 --> 02:00:07,836
l'll cut you up and cook you

1762
02:00:08,314 --> 02:00:11,772
l'll make you shit

1763
02:00:11,851 --> 02:00:14,649
''Peter, what's happening?''

1764
02:00:14,721 --> 02:00:17,519
Semi final. The final is the
day after. - Not cricket

1765
02:00:17,590 --> 02:00:20,423
''You mean, them? lt's about to end''

1766
02:00:36,509 --> 02:00:37,669
Sania!

1767
02:00:45,351 --> 02:00:48,752
''l told you, Sania is with us''

1768
02:00:48,821 --> 02:00:51,346
Little Don supplies fake stuff

1769
02:00:51,424 --> 02:00:55,656
Ching Pong is confusing you.
This girl is skinny

1770
02:00:55,728 --> 02:00:59,926
l'll give you real strong stuff.
This is not even Sania's baby

1771
02:01:00,366 --> 02:01:02,732
Undertaker!
- l'm wearing an underwear

1772
02:01:04,203 --> 02:01:05,397
Take him away

1773
02:01:08,541 --> 02:01:09,599
''Take him away!
- Come on, l say''

1774
02:01:09,676 --> 02:01:10,768
Bury him

1775
02:01:13,513 --> 02:01:17,279
Where are you diamonds?

1776
02:01:18,718 --> 02:01:19,810
''Where's the bag, darling?''

1777
02:01:21,521 --> 02:01:23,352
''Carlos,
- Yes, my love?''

1778
02:01:24,557 --> 02:01:26,388
The bag is with the police.
- What..?

1779
02:01:27,627 --> 02:01:29,788
But the diamonds weren't in it

1780
02:01:31,297 --> 02:01:33,959
''l had put them inside sandals,
and the sandals vanished''

1781
02:01:34,434 --> 02:01:37,733
Everyone was there in the slums
where we found the sandals

1782
02:01:38,571 --> 02:01:39,663
Except Kishan

1783
02:01:41,374 --> 02:01:45,367
''Which means, Kishan has
the sandals and diamonds''

1784
02:01:45,445 --> 02:01:48,573
Kishan? Who the F is Kishan?

1785
02:01:48,648 --> 02:01:52,778
l know Kishan. He escaped
to Mumbai from Goa

1786
02:01:53,319 --> 02:01:57,415
''Carlos, l can get you
Kishan and the diamonds''

1787
02:01:59,258 --> 02:02:00,452
Ring ceremony

1788
02:02:10,603 --> 02:02:12,730
You got the money?

1789
02:02:16,442 --> 02:02:17,636
Summon the bride

1790
02:02:22,348 --> 02:02:23,508
Ms Sania

1791
02:02:23,583 --> 02:02:26,552
''Father, it's Julie.
- Ms Julie,''

1792
02:02:26,619 --> 02:02:27,847
where's Sania?

1793
02:02:37,430 --> 02:02:40,456
Who are you?
- Dinanath Chavan. Sania's father

1794
02:02:40,533 --> 02:02:42,296
''Yes, same features''

1795
02:02:43,703 --> 02:02:45,933
''Father-in-law, where are you?
- Over here''

1796
02:02:46,472 --> 02:02:47,837
Bless you.
- My respects

1797
02:02:51,711 --> 02:02:53,611
''Hello? Yes, Borkar?''

1798
02:02:56,749 --> 02:02:59,013
''l'm ready to play the music, sir.
- Later, Borkar''

1799
02:02:59,385 --> 02:03:01,376
Let Carlos and entourage come

1800
02:03:03,456 --> 02:03:04,650
Tied up

1801
02:03:08,528 --> 02:03:10,723
''Hurry up.
- Hang on, priest''

1802
02:03:10,797 --> 02:03:12,628
They are tying up.
- Mr Shastri!

1803
02:03:12,699 --> 02:03:16,328
Looking behind before the
marital vows is ominous

1804
02:03:16,402 --> 02:03:17,835
The husband dies before the nuptials

1805
02:03:35,688 --> 02:03:37,588
Who told you to clean these?
- He did

1806
02:03:38,758 --> 02:03:44,025
''Wash these first.
- Was this, was that.. damn''

1807
02:04:01,881 --> 02:04:02,973
''What happened, Titli?''

1808
02:04:03,049 --> 02:04:06,450
Something's wrong with Titli.
- What happened?

1809
02:04:07,720 --> 02:04:08,880
''What happened, dear?''

1810
02:04:18,731 --> 02:04:19,925
''Don't, son. Come on''

1811
02:04:30,810 --> 02:04:32,869
Chintu! Montu! Hold him

1812
02:04:32,945 --> 02:04:36,540
He was running away. Put him
in the drum and roll him

1813
02:04:49,495 --> 02:04:51,486
lt's Sania's mother. Greetings

1814
02:04:57,570 --> 02:04:58,764
Father

1815
02:05:10,449 --> 02:05:11,609
Damn..!

1816
02:05:15,521 --> 02:05:16,681
God!

1817
02:05:21,861 --> 02:05:23,726
You are..

1818
02:05:23,796 --> 02:05:25,593
You are to much

1819
02:05:29,035 --> 02:05:32,801
You didn't tell me you got a
haircut before the wedding

1820
02:05:33,606 --> 02:05:35,665
You look nice in short hair

1821
02:05:36,542 --> 02:05:39,636
''Come on, let's finish the last round''

1822
02:05:41,047 --> 02:05:44,574
You'll be damned! You
are trapping yourself

1823
02:05:44,650 --> 02:05:46,948
''lt's not a woman, it's
a man. Let's see..''

1824
02:05:47,019 --> 02:05:49,749
Don't you dare call my Sania a man!

1825
02:05:50,756 --> 02:05:54,487
What do you mean? With
wig and oranges..

1826
02:05:54,560 --> 02:05:58,496
does he think he's a celestial
beauty? - What is he raving?

1827
02:05:58,564 --> 02:05:59,758
Tell him

1828
02:06:04,003 --> 02:06:09,873
Which means l was marrying a man?

1829
02:06:11,677 --> 02:06:12,837
Silence

1830
02:06:15,581 --> 02:06:18,516
''Actually, Mr Shastri,
l didn't marry you''

1831
02:06:18,584 --> 02:06:20,677
l married her

1832
02:06:21,654 --> 02:06:24,782
lt's not over yet. There's
one last round. Quick

1833
02:06:24,857 --> 02:06:26,017
Hurry

1834
02:06:30,763 --> 02:06:32,253
''Sorry, Mr Shastri.
- Sorry''

1835
02:06:35,067 --> 02:06:36,830
''Without looking at you, without
thinking, l loved you''

1836
02:06:38,604 --> 02:06:41,539
And you stabbed my desires
using deceit

1837
02:06:41,607 --> 02:06:42,733
You..!

1838
02:06:46,779 --> 02:06:49,680
May you live happily ever after..

1839
02:06:49,749 --> 02:06:51,740
l pray

1840
02:06:59,625 --> 02:07:02,150
Carlos is here with his men

1841
02:07:02,228 --> 02:07:03,718
Let him come

1842
02:07:09,902 --> 02:07:11,199
Be ready. Carlos is coming

1843
02:07:19,578 --> 02:07:20,772
Who among is Kishan?

1844
02:07:27,720 --> 02:07:28,982
He..

1845
02:07:29,055 --> 02:07:30,852
What he?
- There he is

1846
02:07:30,923 --> 02:07:33,790
''There is Kishan, cross-dressed''

1847
02:07:36,762 --> 02:07:37,922
Where are my diamonds?

1848
02:07:38,998 --> 02:07:40,090
Sandal.
- Sandal?

1849
02:07:40,166 --> 02:07:41,258
Sandal

1850
02:07:47,606 --> 02:07:48,732
Yes!

1851
02:07:48,808 --> 02:07:49,934
Left

1852
02:07:50,009 --> 02:07:54,742
Left. Next to the right.
That's right

1853
02:07:58,951 --> 02:08:00,145
Give it to Carlos

1854
02:08:10,696 --> 02:08:12,129
Little Don!

1855
02:08:41,727 --> 02:08:44,719
''From a don, he's turned
into a revolutionary''

1856
02:08:44,797 --> 02:08:48,198
''Brother, throw the sandal here''

1857
02:08:51,003 --> 02:08:52,834
The sandal is being smuggled

1858
02:08:56,175 --> 02:08:57,665
Bloody!

1859
02:09:00,212 --> 02:09:01,873
Goodness me!

1860
02:09:03,849 --> 02:09:05,680
Ramu!

1861
02:09:34,780 --> 02:09:36,372
He's going round and round..

1862
02:09:45,057 --> 02:09:47,719
He's going round and round..

1863
02:09:47,793 --> 02:09:50,819
To hell with the diamonds!
l'll become a don later

1864
02:09:50,896 --> 02:09:57,096
''Wifey, brave it! The
other woman is coming''

1865
02:10:01,807 --> 02:10:04,901
Kishan! l'm going to feed
you oranges today

1866
02:10:04,977 --> 02:10:06,877
Don't waste this orange.
lt's worth millions

1867
02:10:06,946 --> 02:10:10,404
Worth millions?
- Yes. One orange has hundred seeds

1868
02:10:10,483 --> 02:10:11,814
''Hundred seeds, hundred trees.''

1869
02:10:11,884 --> 02:10:13,112
''Hundred trees,
hundred-thousand oranges''

1870
02:10:13,185 --> 02:10:15,745
''Hundred-thousand oranges, million
seeds, millions of oranges..''

1871
02:10:15,821 --> 02:10:17,880
and business worth millions.
An orange worth millions

02:10:18,924 --> 02:10:20,915
l'll do this business. l'll do
farming at the Nepal border

1873
02:10:20,993 --> 02:10:23,894
''Rana, give me that orange''

1874
02:10:23,963 --> 02:10:26,124
''No.
- Rana, give me that orange''

1875
02:10:26,198 --> 02:10:27,324
No!
- Rana!

1876
02:10:41,313 --> 02:10:44,248
The child is serious. Surgery
must be performed soon

1877
02:10:44,316 --> 02:10:45,943
Please organise the money.
- Doctor..

''ls he our man?

1883
02:11:31,397 --> 02:11:33,456
''When you have money, there's
no dearth of relatives''

1884
02:11:35,000 --> 02:11:36,900
Can l say something?
- Speak

1885
02:11:36,969 --> 02:11:38,027
You are wrong

1886
02:11:40,906 --> 02:11:41,998
Namane

1887
02:11:43,909 --> 02:11:45,035
''You are under arrest, Carlos''

1888
02:11:46,445 --> 02:11:48,413
''Mane!

circle of trust on reaching Mumbai

02:12:06,098 --> 02:12:07,395
Ring?

1897
02:12:09,868 --> 02:12:10,994
Mr Gill

1898

''They are with us? Join the club, bro''

1899
02:12:15,007 --> 02:12:17,407
''Not with us.

1900
02:12:17,476 --> 02:12:20,536
''Sir, l was bringing him to you..

''Thank you, Mane.
- Thank you, sir''

1903
02:12:26,952 --> 02:12:28,613
Arrest them!

1904
02:12:29,221 --> 02:12:32,884
Why didn't you take
him into confidence?

1905
02:12:32,958 --> 02:12:35,324
Get me my diamonds

1906
02:12:37,963 --> 02:12:40,056
Brother Arjun..
- Cutting..

1907
02:12:40,132 --> 02:12:43,158
what happened?
- Titli is in hospital

1908
02:12:43,235 --> 02:12:44,896
''What?

1909
02:12:44,970 --> 02:12:47,962
''must be done within
two days, else..''

1910
02:12:51,443 --> 02:12:54,435
''Please save her life, brother
Arjun. - Yes.. nothing will happen''

1911
02:12:56,081 --> 02:13:00,609
''Titli's smile is precious
than these jewellery, Arjun''

1912
02:13:01,987 --> 02:13:05,286
Yes Arjun. l don't want to
make a video album anymore

1913
02:13:05,357 --> 02:13:09,088
Keep the money.
- Use this. Save the kid

1914
02:13:09,161 --> 02:13:12,653
Consider that l was overcharging
my customers for this very day

1915
02:13:15,000 --> 02:13:18,197
''l don't want to be a graduate,
l don't want to make it big''

1916
02:13:28,247 --> 02:13:31,648
l will dance when you
marry sister Shivani

1917
02:13:33,018 --> 02:13:34,144
You folks don't understand

1918
02:13:36,622 --> 02:13:41,423
We need 1 .5 million.
l don't know how..

1919
02:13:45,030 --> 02:13:48,124
''For the first time,
l despise being poor''

1920
02:13:50,569 --> 02:13:53,595
''Even if we sell ourselves,
we can't save one life''

1921
02:13:58,110 --> 02:14:02,103
God is a lie. There's no god

1922
02:14:02,181 --> 02:14:06,049
There is. There is God.
And God is great

1923
02:14:06,118 --> 02:14:07,983
''Kishan, please..
- Forget it''

1924
02:14:08,053 --> 02:14:10,988
When He wrote a screenplay and sent
diamonds here worth 500 million..

1925
02:14:11,056 --> 02:14:14,651
you guys told me to give
the sandal away. Gone

1926
02:14:15,060 --> 02:14:17,324
Now you are crying for money.
- What else do we do?

1927
02:14:17,396 --> 02:14:19,159
500 million in diamonds..
- So?

1928
02:14:19,231 --> 02:14:20,289
Had we even picked one..
- You should've picked it

1929
02:14:20,366 --> 02:14:21,697
l did

1930
02:14:23,135 --> 02:14:24,602
What..?
- l picked one

1931
02:14:30,409 --> 02:14:32,070
''But Kishan, it is..
- No Arjun''

1932
02:14:32,144 --> 02:14:33,304
Not today

1933
02:14:34,546 --> 02:14:36,309
''When honesty fails, use falsehood.''

1934
02:14:36,382 --> 02:14:38,441
''When rights are not given,
snatch them''

1935
02:14:39,618 --> 02:14:40,676
Not today

1936
02:14:43,422 --> 02:14:44,753
My last theft

1937
02:14:46,458 --> 02:14:49,655
''Come, let's snatch Titli's
life from Death''

1938
02:14:50,429 --> 02:14:51,521
Kishan..
