1
00:01:59,953 --> 00:02:01,716
There is nothing in it.

2
00:02:03,923 --> 00:02:04,548
Yes, you're right.

3
00:02:04,757 --> 00:02:06,554
vergheese, is this how you do business?

4
00:02:06,759 --> 00:02:07,282
Yes, this is how l do it.

5
00:02:07,494 --> 00:02:08,761
ls this how you do business?

6
00:02:08,761 --> 00:02:10,592
l was patient while you were
replacing all these.

7
00:02:11,164 --> 00:02:12,927
What so big deal in it?

8
00:02:13,166 --> 00:02:14,155
They are not coconuts at all.

9
00:02:14,367 --> 00:02:15,425
Then, are they beetle nuts?

10
00:02:15,869 --> 00:02:19,168
Anyway, l'm not going to replace them.

11
00:02:19,639 --> 00:02:22,369
Don't try to fool me.

12
00:02:27,046 --> 00:02:28,513
There is no use talking to him.

13
00:02:30,984 --> 00:02:32,076
No need to check those coconuts.

14
00:02:32,285 --> 00:02:33,616
Let me see.

15
00:02:34,220 --> 00:02:37,815
There is nothing to be surprised about it.

16
00:02:38,024 --> 00:02:44,657
He is the son of the man who doesn't
even mind taking a coin from shit.

17
00:02:44,864 --> 00:02:47,526
He resembles his father.

18
00:02:47,734 --> 00:02:49,599
Careful! Don't abuse my father.

19
00:02:52,205 --> 00:02:53,069
Why are you getting tensed unnecessarily?

20
00:02:53,273 --> 00:02:55,036
Now dare to abuse my father again.

21
00:02:55,241 --> 00:02:56,765
l wasn't talking to you at all.

22
00:02:56,976 --> 00:02:57,806
Who else were you talking to?

23
00:02:58,011 --> 00:02:59,069
l was talking to vergheese.

24
00:02:59,279 --> 00:03:01,213
But still it was about me
you were talking about.

25
00:03:03,082 --> 00:03:03,639
Catch hold of him.

26
00:03:03,816 --> 00:03:06,341
Let them say anything.

27
00:03:06,553 --> 00:03:08,282
Why are you getting tensed unnecessarily?

28
00:03:08,488 --> 00:03:10,080
Mother, you didn't hear what he said.

29
00:03:11,124 --> 00:03:13,456
May be he is drunk.

30
00:03:13,660 --> 00:03:14,854
l should've chopped him into pieces.

31
00:03:15,595 --> 00:03:17,426
Leave me.

32
00:03:20,600 --> 00:03:22,227
How can he talk like that?

33
00:03:22,435 --> 00:03:26,303
He never used to open his mouth
when your father was alive.

34
00:03:26,506 --> 00:03:27,837
But now, look how he is talking.

35
00:03:28,341 --> 00:03:31,504
After his father's death,
everyone has started to wag their tails.

36
00:03:31,811 --> 00:03:33,438
He will say anything he likes.

37
00:03:33,913 --> 00:03:35,039
He has the right on our land.

38
00:03:35,248 --> 00:03:36,840
Everyone is on his side.

39
00:03:37,050 --> 00:03:38,244
Landlords have none on their side.

40
00:03:38,851 --> 00:03:40,978
Stop, don't go.
- What did he think of me?

41
00:03:41,621 --> 00:03:42,246
Go inside.

42
00:03:45,058 --> 00:03:49,085
l'm talking to you knowing
the current market rates.

43
00:03:50,029 --> 00:03:53,521
Yes. Rs. 1 .20.

44
00:03:54,834 --> 00:03:57,302
90 paise is okay for you but not for me.

45
00:03:58,571 --> 00:04:01,938
There are totally 60 trees.

46
00:04:02,942 --> 00:04:06,241
l can't tell you how many l will get.

47
00:04:07,547 --> 00:04:09,014
May be.

48
00:04:09,249 --> 00:04:11,581
May be few more than your count.

49
00:04:14,153 --> 00:04:15,814
l'm not desperate to sell.

50
00:04:17,957 --> 00:04:21,120
lf you accept my rate, come.

51
00:04:21,494 --> 00:04:24,327
Orelse why waste time & money.

52
00:04:27,166 --> 00:04:30,863
Listen, if you don't come
on the said date,

53
00:04:31,070 --> 00:04:32,469
then there is no point in blaming me.

54
00:04:32,639 --> 00:04:33,367
Yes.

55
00:04:33,673 --> 00:04:34,833
l'll find a another buyer.

56
00:04:35,441 --> 00:04:36,965
Okay. Bye.

57
00:04:43,549 --> 00:04:44,243
Don't you have to take bath?

58
00:04:44,684 --> 00:04:45,946
ls it enough if you keep counting numbers?

59
00:04:46,352 --> 00:04:49,913
Let the pond cool down.
lt is still hot.

60
00:04:50,123 --> 00:04:53,991
You never know to take bath
& keep yourself clean.

61
00:04:54,227 --> 00:04:56,718
To take bath...?
Only now l came back from work.

62
00:04:56,996 --> 00:04:57,519
That's what l'm trying to say.

63
00:04:57,730 --> 00:04:58,754
Me too.

64
00:05:00,700 --> 00:05:02,224
Who is that at this hour?

65
00:05:02,702 --> 00:05:03,566
ls it Rishi?

66
00:05:09,542 --> 00:05:10,566
So, you have come!

67
00:05:11,144 --> 00:05:12,338
He is not going to take bath.

68
00:05:12,545 --> 00:05:14,342
Have you got it?
- Yes.

69
00:05:14,981 --> 00:05:19,008
lf we give it to him,
it is very tough to get it back.

70
00:05:19,218 --> 00:05:21,152
Don't you know anyother guy
other than him?

71
00:05:21,921 --> 00:05:22,819
There is no point in blaming him.

72
00:05:23,022 --> 00:05:24,853
How many times have you got it repaired?

73
00:05:25,058 --> 00:05:26,082
8 or 9 times?

74
00:05:27,894 --> 00:05:28,690
lt has been repaired very well.

75
00:05:29,062 --> 00:05:30,529
Here on, it will run very smoothly.

76
00:05:31,130 --> 00:05:33,894
lt will run for another 8 1/2 months.

77
00:05:34,200 --> 00:05:36,293
Why 8 1/2?
Why not 9 months?

78
00:05:37,770 --> 00:05:40,364
l've a doubt.
Will you tell the truth?

79
00:05:40,640 --> 00:05:41,538
Tell me sister.

80
00:05:41,741 --> 00:05:44,801
You take this to town to get it repaired

81
00:05:45,011 --> 00:05:46,376
and bring it back.

82
00:05:46,579 --> 00:05:48,604
Don't you charge for these?
- Charge means?

83
00:05:48,815 --> 00:05:50,806
Won't you take money for it?

84
00:05:51,017 --> 00:05:51,449
Hey...

85
00:05:51,651 --> 00:05:56,782
He charges for all his expenses.

86
00:05:56,923 --> 00:05:59,221
Rs.5 for taking it
& Rs. 6 for bringing it back.

87
00:05:59,425 --> 00:06:01,154
Totally Rs. 1 1 for transportation.

88
00:06:01,361 --> 00:06:02,828
What do you think of him?

89
00:06:03,029 --> 00:06:04,394
He is very clever.

90
00:06:05,131 --> 00:06:07,998
Just for Rs. 1 1? So sad!

91
00:06:09,635 --> 00:06:11,432
You both gel very well.

92
00:06:13,973 --> 00:06:17,067
How is your new venture?
ls it profitable?

93
00:06:17,276 --> 00:06:19,039
lt's better we don't discuss about it.

94
00:06:19,712 --> 00:06:21,179
Only if any bulb in a near by house get fused,

95
00:06:21,381 --> 00:06:22,712
l'll get business.

96
00:06:22,949 --> 00:06:26,248
The wires & cables which l bought
are still untouched.

97
00:06:26,452 --> 00:06:27,441
lt's better they don't rust.

98
00:06:27,653 --> 00:06:30,315
There is a solution for it.

99
00:06:30,790 --> 00:06:32,257
l know what you do.

100
00:06:32,458 --> 00:06:40,490
You sit on a chair
& ogle at the girls who pass by.

101
00:06:43,536 --> 00:06:45,436
There is a little truth
in what you said.

102
00:06:46,005 --> 00:06:48,166
l can atleast have a good view
of the girls.

103
00:06:48,674 --> 00:06:50,437
That's why l stay there.

104
00:06:50,977 --> 00:06:52,740
There is nothing in this village.

105
00:06:53,446 --> 00:06:56,438
l'm only an ordinary guy.
You can lead a luxurious life since

106
00:06:56,749 --> 00:06:59,547
you're the son of Thambooran.
But can l lead such a life?

107
00:07:00,453 --> 00:07:04,116
l'm getting few proposals for marriage.

108
00:07:04,991 --> 00:07:08,722
lf they ask about my job, l will tell
them that l've business in town.

109
00:07:09,362 --> 00:07:11,887
When l live in town, l can look
after the business & ogle at girls.

110
00:07:12,031 --> 00:07:16,127
You can only ogle at girls & nothing more.

111
00:07:16,335 --> 00:07:17,427
You have such a charming
& a lucky face.

112
00:07:17,837 --> 00:07:19,134
Yes, it is true.

113
00:07:25,244 --> 00:07:26,643
They are only kids.

114
00:07:27,914 --> 00:07:29,905
Why talk about town?

115
00:07:30,116 --> 00:07:31,640
You come here once in a week.

116
00:07:31,851 --> 00:07:32,818
That's why you don't know
what's happening in the village.

117
00:07:32,985 --> 00:07:34,475
Do you know what all is happening here?

118
00:07:35,188 --> 00:07:38,624
You should listen to the
experiences of little boys.

119
00:07:39,025 --> 00:07:41,357
Those are real life experiences.

120
00:07:41,494 --> 00:07:42,483
We'll be shocked to hear that.

121
00:07:45,031 --> 00:07:46,931
We must also break that.

122
00:07:48,134 --> 00:07:50,659
Go ahead. Who is stopping you?

123
00:07:51,037 --> 00:07:53,505
Tresya Joseph lives close to your house.

124
00:07:53,706 --> 00:07:55,901
Shit!
- What shit!

125
00:07:56,042 --> 00:07:58,169
She is now the dream girl of this village.

126
00:07:58,277 --> 00:07:59,904
She is the cuckoo of this village.

127
00:08:00,213 --> 00:08:00,804
Really?

128
00:08:01,013 --> 00:08:04,505
All the boys of the village are after her.

129
00:08:05,051 --> 00:08:09,886
She goes to town very frequently
in different A/C cars.

130
00:08:10,089 --> 00:08:11,886
l've heard some rumours about her.

131
00:08:12,091 --> 00:08:13,456
Since she is your neighbour,

132
00:08:13,659 --> 00:08:16,093
Why not try once?
There is nothing to lose.

133
00:08:16,295 --> 00:08:16,954
No.

134
00:08:17,864 --> 00:08:19,263
l can't spoil may image in the village.

135
00:08:19,732 --> 00:08:24,101
lf we lose our status
& image here, where else can we go?

136
00:08:25,271 --> 00:08:27,603
lf we are not careful,
our image will get spoiled.

137
00:08:27,807 --> 00:08:31,140
You will die due to constipation.

138
00:08:31,310 --> 00:08:32,038
You too.

139
00:09:00,006 --> 00:09:03,339
Where is Devi electricals shop?
- Go that way.

140
00:09:03,543 --> 00:09:04,237
That way...?

141
00:09:13,286 --> 00:09:14,218
l've found you.

142
00:09:14,487 --> 00:09:17,718
lt was very difficult to find your shop.

143
00:09:18,357 --> 00:09:19,415
How come you are here?

144
00:09:20,192 --> 00:09:21,386
lt's very hot.

145
00:09:22,328 --> 00:09:26,230
Jose, order 2 teas please.
- No tea. l've to go.

146
00:09:26,599 --> 00:09:27,691
C'mon, you came just now.

147
00:09:27,967 --> 00:09:29,400
That doesn't mean l've no urgent work.

148
00:09:30,369 --> 00:09:34,362
You showroom is well decorated.

149
00:09:35,608 --> 00:09:37,098
What brought you here?

150
00:09:37,543 --> 00:09:40,444
l came here to buy a goat's head.

151
00:09:41,180 --> 00:09:42,772
To make soup for my mother.

152
00:09:43,049 --> 00:09:44,641
lt is a good cure for the pain
in the joints.

153
00:09:44,984 --> 00:09:47,953
Unlike in village,
we get it very fresh here.

154
00:09:48,521 --> 00:09:51,115
Since l've come this far,
l will buy some vegetables too.

155
00:09:51,324 --> 00:09:54,054
The prices are very cheap.

156
00:09:54,226 --> 00:09:55,056
But still,

157
00:09:55,227 --> 00:09:58,719
have you come here to buy
vegetables & goat's head?

158
00:10:02,501 --> 00:10:03,798
Do you believe me now?

159
00:10:04,036 --> 00:10:06,300
Yes.
- Then, come with me.

160
00:10:06,405 --> 00:10:07,394
The bike is in the workshop.

161
00:10:07,840 --> 00:10:09,501
No need for any bike.

162
00:10:10,543 --> 00:10:12,033
Jose, l'll be back soon.

163
00:10:30,563 --> 00:10:33,555
Take it. 20...22...23.

164
00:10:33,966 --> 00:10:34,660
You've given me less than what l told you.

165
00:10:34,867 --> 00:10:36,994
This is enough.
- What?

166
00:10:37,203 --> 00:10:38,261
What l have given you is enough.

167
00:10:39,271 --> 00:10:40,067
You've given me less.

168
00:10:40,272 --> 00:10:41,705
l counted before giving you.

169
00:10:41,907 --> 00:10:43,841
l've given you what l told you.

170
00:10:44,644 --> 00:10:45,440
Wonderful!

171
00:10:45,645 --> 00:10:46,703
Are you the deciding authority?

172
00:10:46,912 --> 00:10:48,402
Yes, in this matter, l decide.

173
00:10:49,382 --> 00:10:50,280
Take this too.

174
00:10:51,717 --> 00:10:54,845
What is this?
- Why bargain for a dead goat's head?

175
00:10:55,054 --> 00:10:56,419
That's what l'm telling you.

176
00:10:56,622 --> 00:10:57,919
So do l.

177
00:11:04,163 --> 00:11:06,631
very hot!

178
00:11:07,066 --> 00:11:08,761
Summer has just started.

179
00:11:09,235 --> 00:11:12,033
l can't stay in my room,
if it is too hot.

180
00:11:12,238 --> 00:11:14,934
You are really great.

181
00:11:16,075 --> 00:11:18,305
Can we have a lime juice?

182
00:11:19,011 --> 00:11:21,377
Lime juice with salt is good during summer.

183
00:11:21,580 --> 00:11:24,048
Yes, it is good.
But it might cost 3 rupees.

184
00:11:24,250 --> 00:11:24,875
lt's okay.

185
00:11:25,084 --> 00:11:28,417
What is the use in earning
if we don't spend a little?

186
00:11:38,964 --> 00:11:41,194
Need more salt?
- Salt?

187
00:11:42,301 --> 00:11:43,666
Salt doesn't cost much.

188
00:11:44,170 --> 00:11:45,398
Got lce cubes?- Sorry.

189
00:11:45,604 --> 00:11:47,231
What's the use of having a
lime juice without ice cubes?

190
00:11:47,440 --> 00:11:48,065
No ice cubes.

191
00:11:48,274 --> 00:11:50,435
You should've told this before.

192
00:11:50,643 --> 00:11:53,874
You should've asked me before.
- Should l?

193
00:11:54,080 --> 00:11:54,774
Yes, you must.

194
00:11:54,980 --> 00:11:56,914
They why did you put up this board?

195
00:11:57,116 --> 00:11:58,242
What is the meaning of COOLDRlNKS?

196
00:11:58,451 --> 00:12:00,646
lt means cool.

197
00:12:00,886 --> 00:12:02,751
Okay, l'll goto school & learn.

198
00:12:02,955 --> 00:12:03,444
What did you say?

199
00:12:03,656 --> 00:12:05,681
No brother...
- Shut your mouth.

200
00:12:05,791 --> 00:12:07,418
lnspite of you giving you
my hard earned money.

201
00:12:07,626 --> 00:12:09,287
should l have to hear what ever you say?

202
00:12:09,462 --> 00:12:11,862
Drink if you want
or else pour it down & leave.

203
00:12:12,064 --> 00:12:13,429
l won't mind if you don't pay for it.

204
00:12:13,632 --> 00:12:15,190
Who wants your charity?

205
00:12:15,668 --> 00:12:17,602
l don't want your dirty lime juice.

206
00:12:17,970 --> 00:12:18,868
You drink it yourself.

207
00:12:19,238 --> 00:12:21,832
l'll find out a shop which gives
lime juice with ice.

208
00:12:22,041 --> 00:12:22,905
Come, lets go.

209
00:12:25,644 --> 00:12:28,204
Shall we go?- But where?

210
00:12:28,414 --> 00:12:30,211
Just come with me.

211
00:12:34,320 --> 00:12:35,116
Go.

212
00:12:42,161 --> 00:12:43,185
Come.

213
00:12:43,763 --> 00:12:44,525
Let the auto wait here.

214
00:12:44,730 --> 00:12:46,960
We'll have a glass of fresh juice.

215
00:12:47,099 --> 00:12:47,793
l'll be back soon.- Okay.

216
00:12:48,000 --> 00:12:48,659
Come.

217
00:12:54,140 --> 00:12:56,870
Hey...- Leave my hand. Come.

218
00:13:13,526 --> 00:13:14,458
Nobody's here.

219
00:13:17,329 --> 00:13:19,763
Thank god! No one here knows me.

220
00:13:21,300 --> 00:13:24,394
Men of our age used to come here.

221
00:13:24,670 --> 00:13:26,001
And l've caught them red handed.

222
00:13:26,806 --> 00:13:29,240
lf anyone sees us here...
- So what?

223
00:13:30,042 --> 00:13:33,534
My honour goes into this air.
- How?

224
00:13:33,746 --> 00:13:35,179
What are you blabbering man?

225
00:13:35,381 --> 00:13:37,474
Will you lose your honour
for drinking lime juice?

226
00:13:37,850 --> 00:13:39,374
Come here.

227
00:13:40,386 --> 00:13:43,480
Got ice cubes?
- For what? To cool your head?

228
00:13:46,225 --> 00:13:50,059
2 fresh lime juice with ice
& without soda.

229
00:13:50,262 --> 00:13:51,695
Add salt instead of sugar.

230
00:13:53,065 --> 00:13:55,397
Squeeze one full lime.

231
00:13:57,903 --> 00:13:59,871
Shouldn't we enjoy our life?

232
00:14:02,908 --> 00:14:04,933
Enjoy? ls this the way to enjoy?

233
00:14:06,245 --> 00:14:07,906
What you said is right?

234
00:14:08,314 --> 00:14:11,477
Enjoy means we must enjoy fully.

235
00:14:13,252 --> 00:14:16,221
Can we have a beer?

236
00:14:17,423 --> 00:14:20,586
lt's nice to have a beer
in this hot summer.

237
00:14:21,594 --> 00:14:25,530
That's true. But now...here?

238
00:14:33,138 --> 00:14:37,074
David, do you have Kingfisher beer...chilled?

239
00:14:37,276 --> 00:14:39,403
Yes, we have.
- 2 bottles of beer.

240
00:14:44,116 --> 00:14:47,108
l was wondering what you are up to.

241
00:15:15,848 --> 00:15:17,008
Please have it.

242
00:15:34,233 --> 00:15:37,532
So, you drink regularly?

243
00:15:39,171 --> 00:15:41,139
No. very rarely.

244
00:16:06,365 --> 00:16:07,730
Who is that?

245
00:16:08,267 --> 00:16:09,666
So you've come.

246
00:16:14,206 --> 00:16:18,404
He's Jacob. He's Unni master.
He's Babu.

247
00:16:18,610 --> 00:16:19,975
He's lnashu.

248
00:16:20,045 --> 00:16:21,444
6 beers please.

249
00:16:21,647 --> 00:16:22,511
Stop staring at us.

250
00:16:22,848 --> 00:16:25,180
You drink.

251
00:16:27,386 --> 00:16:30,514
Mr. George, what's the hot news?

252
00:16:30,823 --> 00:16:31,949
Nothing hot.

253
00:16:32,057 --> 00:16:35,584
l was watching him performing
a new play.

254
00:16:38,797 --> 00:16:40,594
Come here.

255
00:16:40,833 --> 00:16:41,891
How are you?

256
00:16:42,134 --> 00:16:44,364
ls it your bag?
What's in it?

257
00:16:44,570 --> 00:16:46,765
vegetables...

258
00:16:48,407 --> 00:16:50,637
There is goat's head in it.

259
00:16:50,809 --> 00:16:52,868
Keep it down.

260
00:17:01,520 --> 00:17:03,249
Look, he is Babu.

261
00:17:03,489 --> 00:17:06,117
3 of his buses run in our place.

262
00:17:06,658 --> 00:17:07,716
Devamadha...

263
00:17:07,926 --> 00:17:09,325
Yes, Devamadha.

264
00:17:09,528 --> 00:17:10,790
He is the owner of Devamadha.

265
00:17:11,030 --> 00:17:13,999
His family owns totally 1 7 buses.

266
00:17:14,466 --> 00:17:17,560
Babu, he is Rishi into electrical business.

267
00:17:18,170 --> 00:17:21,264
Electrical business?
What business is that?

268
00:17:21,907 --> 00:17:26,071
Where?
- ln the market. Devi Electricals.

269
00:17:27,413 --> 00:17:29,040
Devi Electricals...?

270
00:17:30,149 --> 00:17:31,980
Electricity to Devi (Goddess)?

271
00:17:36,855 --> 00:17:38,914
He is my friend.
He lives near my house.

272
00:17:39,124 --> 00:17:41,285
Don't rag him.- Okay.

273
00:17:41,894 --> 00:17:44,920
Lets not waste time.
Lets party.

274
00:17:46,031 --> 00:17:48,022
How did you escape from the party?

275
00:17:48,233 --> 00:17:50,394
That's a very big story.

276
00:18:05,384 --> 00:18:06,316
l'm not drunk.

277
00:18:07,319 --> 00:18:09,048
l remember very well.

278
00:18:10,322 --> 00:18:12,654
What's our next programme?
- As you say.

279
00:18:14,059 --> 00:18:18,894
Can we break his ..............?

280
00:18:55,134 --> 00:18:58,103
l didn't drink much.

281
00:18:58,370 --> 00:19:00,270
Don't pay for the bills.

282
00:19:01,306 --> 00:19:04,104
Never pay for the bills.
- Sit here.

283
00:19:19,057 --> 00:19:23,187
l'm going there only.
You bring him there.- Okay.

284
00:19:29,635 --> 00:19:31,125
Bye David.

285
00:19:45,117 --> 00:19:46,175
What's happening?

286
00:19:49,488 --> 00:19:51,922
Even your intestines might come out.

287
00:19:52,124 --> 00:19:55,252
What's this?
Can you keep quiet for a while?

288
00:19:58,263 --> 00:19:59,958
lt's enough.

289
00:20:01,567 --> 00:20:03,626
What's all this?

290
00:20:04,770 --> 00:20:05,794
Enough.

291
00:20:06,038 --> 00:20:07,403
Make no noise. Take it.

292
00:20:07,773 --> 00:20:12,733
Lime juice...
- We didn't pay for the lime juice.

293
00:20:12,945 --> 00:20:14,344
Stop it.

294
00:20:18,684 --> 00:20:22,745
l'll beat you.
Stop it.

295
00:20:24,189 --> 00:20:25,349
A chic waiting inside.

296
00:20:25,524 --> 00:20:26,991
You told me about your desire,
didn't you?

297
00:20:35,634 --> 00:20:39,195
l think the boy in the counter
is from our place.

298
00:20:39,404 --> 00:20:39,893
Let him be.

299
00:20:40,138 --> 00:20:40,627
Get in.

300
00:20:40,806 --> 00:20:42,171
What bothers me?

301
00:20:42,507 --> 00:20:46,568
Will he cause me some trouble
in the hotel?

302
00:20:46,778 --> 00:20:48,609
No trouble.

303
00:20:48,947 --> 00:20:54,283
Because we have booked the entire floor.

304
00:20:54,486 --> 00:20:57,751
lf any problem crops up,
l'll buy this hotel.

305
00:20:57,956 --> 00:21:01,653
Want to see that happen? Come.

306
00:22:22,574 --> 00:22:25,907
Do you recognize her?
Tresia Jose.

307
00:22:26,611 --> 00:22:28,442
She is from our village.

308
00:22:32,484 --> 00:22:35,647
Are you going to say you don't know me?

309
00:22:36,922 --> 00:22:38,787
l know you.

310
00:22:55,440 --> 00:22:57,806
You both don't have any problem,
do you?

311
00:23:53,498 --> 00:23:56,023
Shall we move?- Yes.

312
00:23:56,334 --> 00:23:57,096
l knew it.

313
00:23:57,269 --> 00:23:58,566
lf l stay here, this play will continue.

314
00:23:59,271 --> 00:24:00,169
Don't stay here.

315
00:24:00,772 --> 00:24:03,070
Will you be here?
- Yes. You can leave.

316
00:24:03,575 --> 00:24:06,510
He is my friend.
- l'll take care of him.

317
00:24:06,711 --> 00:24:07,678
Bye.

318
00:24:43,815 --> 00:24:46,579
lt's only a child's play to him.

319
00:24:46,985 --> 00:24:50,182
When compared to his other activities,
these are nothing.

320
00:24:50,622 --> 00:24:52,419
Did he leave last night itself?

321
00:24:52,624 --> 00:24:57,084
ln your town, people hate him
for being so stingy.

322
00:24:57,429 --> 00:25:00,728
Which of the two is true?

323
00:25:01,066 --> 00:25:01,589
To him, everything means fun.

324
00:25:01,733 --> 00:25:02,927
He is more trustworthy than a bank.

325
00:25:03,068 --> 00:25:04,194
You can stay here till 12 O'clock.

326
00:25:04,402 --> 00:25:05,767
No, l'll move now.

327
00:25:10,909 --> 00:25:15,812
What you told me about him is true, ah?

328
00:25:16,014 --> 00:25:17,811
Yes, whatever l told you about him is true.

329
00:25:18,016 --> 00:25:19,711
Why should l lie to you about him?

330
00:25:19,918 --> 00:25:24,514
You said he never slept
with any girl till now.

331
00:25:24,589 --> 00:25:25,613
As far as l know, he never did.

332
00:25:27,192 --> 00:25:29,023
He does such things for his friends.

333
00:25:29,227 --> 00:25:30,091
l understood.

334
00:25:31,196 --> 00:25:33,323
Does he have lot of friends in this town?

335
00:25:33,565 --> 00:25:34,259
l didn't know.

336
00:25:34,466 --> 00:25:38,368
He lived here for more than 4 yrs.

337
00:25:38,570 --> 00:25:41,300
He used to be a hero
when he was in college.

338
00:25:41,806 --> 00:25:44,639
He had spent most of his father's earnings.

339
00:25:45,110 --> 00:25:48,409
He never needs any money
to do anything in this town.

340
00:25:48,613 --> 00:25:49,375
How is that possible?

341
00:25:49,581 --> 00:25:50,240
Yes, it is possible.

342
00:25:50,815 --> 00:25:52,806
Everyone knows about him.

343
00:25:53,018 --> 00:25:58,320
He personally comes
& pays the dues within a week.

344
00:25:58,690 --> 00:26:00,157
That his secret.

345
00:26:00,425 --> 00:26:02,086
And he'll leave without anyone's knowledge.

346
00:26:05,597 --> 00:26:13,504
So, hotels, bars, taxis
offer their free service to him.

347
00:26:13,705 --> 00:26:15,673
lf l tell this to the villagers,
they will beat me.

348
00:26:15,874 --> 00:26:18,001
Why do you want to tell them unnecessarily?

349
00:26:18,710 --> 00:26:22,111
l told you all this because he told me
to tell you if you ask about him.

350
00:26:40,332 --> 00:26:42,300
We should have brought aunty with us.

351
00:26:42,500 --> 00:26:45,094
All the 9 houses are in different directions.

352
00:26:45,303 --> 00:26:46,201
My mother knows.

353
00:26:46,404 --> 00:26:48,304
That's why she sent us.

354
00:26:49,674 --> 00:26:52,700
She sent us to wander around the village.

355
00:26:57,415 --> 00:26:59,076
Somebody is coming this way.

356
00:27:01,252 --> 00:27:03,379
Here? Who are they?

357
00:27:13,198 --> 00:27:15,166
Stop staring at them. Do your work.

358
00:27:26,511 --> 00:27:28,103
Where is Mannarthodi's house?

359
00:27:30,215 --> 00:27:31,409
Mannarthodi...?

360
00:27:32,250 --> 00:27:33,239
What's the matter?

361
00:27:35,520 --> 00:27:36,248
Where are you coming from?

362
00:27:36,454 --> 00:27:38,422
From town.- l knew it.

363
00:27:40,792 --> 00:27:42,657
Why do you want to goto his house?

364
00:27:44,496 --> 00:27:46,896
l'm from Mannarthodi. Tell me.

365
00:27:48,299 --> 00:27:49,459
Jaikrishna Menon...
- Yes.

366
00:27:51,503 --> 00:27:54,370
You must have heard about me.
- l've also seen him.

367
00:27:54,739 --> 00:27:57,207
You were my senior in college.

368
00:27:57,809 --> 00:28:00,209
Really? What's your name?
- Ranjini.

369
00:28:01,846 --> 00:28:05,873
You won't remember me.
Jaikrishnan has changed a lot.

370
00:28:06,418 --> 00:28:07,783
We've to change.

371
00:28:08,353 --> 00:28:11,117
Ranjini, what are you doing?
- l'm a teacher.

372
00:28:11,322 --> 00:28:13,222
Teaching students.

Where exactly?
- Saudi.

376
00:28:21,933 --> 00:28:23,127
So, you meet him once in a year.

377
00:28:23,334 --> 00:28:25,393
He went very recently.

378
00:28:25,937 --> 00:28:27,302
very difficult, ah?

379
00:28:33,945 --> 00:28:37,176
We came to invitite you.
- For what?

380
00:28:37,282 --> 00:28:38,249
For a ''Sapthathi''?

381
00:28:38,450 --> 00:28:41,681
Sapthathi means 70th birthday, right?

382
00:28:42,554 --> 00:28:45,079
You don't look like 70 yr. old women?

383
00:28:45,290 --> 00:28:45,847
Not us.

384
00:28:46,057 --> 00:28:48,184
lt is for our Great grandmother.
- Whose great grandmother?

385
00:28:48,393 --> 00:28:51,829
Ours. She is Radha, my cousin.

386
00:28:52,030 --> 00:28:53,361
My father's sister's daughter.

387
00:28:53,565 --> 00:28:55,931
l live with her in town.

388
00:28:56,134 --> 00:28:57,761
When is the function?
- On 7th.

389
00:28:57,969 --> 00:28:58,697
7th of next month?

390
00:28:59,104 --> 00:29:00,765
7th of this month has gone.

391
00:29:05,977 --> 00:29:07,774
l can't come.

392
00:29:07,979 --> 00:29:09,071
No need.

393
00:29:09,147 --> 00:29:10,876
We came to invite the ladies only.

394
00:29:11,549 --> 00:29:14,643
Malini sister, Sridevi kutty,
Karthiadithiamma.

395
00:29:14,853 --> 00:29:16,445
One of them will come.

396
00:29:17,989 --> 00:29:21,288
Who? How do you know them?

397
00:29:21,826 --> 00:29:25,387
Do you know Malini's husband
late Kunjikrishnan?- Yes.

398
00:29:25,597 --> 00:29:27,792
Kunjikrishnan's sister's husband
is K.R. Marathu.

399
00:29:27,999 --> 00:29:28,522
Yes Marathu.

400
00:29:28,733 --> 00:29:31,293
Radha's father married K.R.'s sister.

401
00:29:31,503 --> 00:29:34,370
That means my mother's brother,
Baskar uncle.

402
00:29:34,572 --> 00:29:36,631
So she is from Thiruvarpathu...?

403
00:29:36,775 --> 00:29:39,539
Yes, you're right.
- Only now l understood.

404
00:29:40,011 --> 00:29:44,141
You've a brother named Madhavan
who is a journalist. - Yes.

405
00:29:44,349 --> 00:29:45,748
So, you have also come here before.

406
00:29:45,950 --> 00:29:47,315
Yes. But long back.

407
00:29:48,586 --> 00:29:55,014
Wow! You've grown up very fast.

408
00:29:55,460 --> 00:29:57,826
When you came here before,
you were very bony.

409
00:29:58,096 --> 00:30:03,090
While coming this way,
you sit on Madhavan cycle's hand bar

410
00:30:03,301 --> 00:30:07,465
and you used to look like
a little lizard.

411
00:30:08,273 --> 00:30:10,503
Are you not coming with us
to your house?- l'll try.

412
00:30:11,743 --> 00:30:15,839
Go straight & you'll end up
in our garden.

413
00:30:16,114 --> 00:30:17,843
From there, you can see our house.

414
00:30:18,049 --> 00:30:18,913
Go straight.

415
00:30:23,888 --> 00:30:25,378
What did you say your name is?

416
00:30:27,225 --> 00:30:28,715
Radha.- Yes, Radha.

417
00:30:28,993 --> 00:30:36,832
When you meet anyone,
try to give some respect.

418
00:30:43,575 --> 00:30:48,205
What is this?
- He is very uncultured.

419
00:31:09,100 --> 00:31:11,534
l told her that l like her.

420
00:31:11,703 --> 00:31:15,298
You could've told me when she was here.

421
00:31:15,506 --> 00:31:16,438
What would've happened?

422
00:31:16,641 --> 00:31:20,907
l would've enquired about
that girl with Ranjini.

423
00:31:21,112 --> 00:31:23,410
Why beat around the bush?

424
00:31:23,481 --> 00:31:25,745
l myself would've told her.

425
00:31:25,950 --> 00:31:27,474
Will she pounce on me if l tell her?

426
00:31:27,952 --> 00:31:29,943
How can we talk about this to girls
of this generation?

427
00:31:30,154 --> 00:31:33,089
lf we take this proposal to them,
they'll surely accept it.

428
00:31:33,992 --> 00:31:35,687
lt isn't because you're smart.

429
00:31:35,927 --> 00:31:38,418
lt's because you are the
son of Justice Thambooran.

430
00:31:39,130 --> 00:31:42,588
Or else no intelligent
& modern girl will ever marry you.

431
00:31:43,034 --> 00:31:44,365
l'll throw this on you.

432
00:32:21,539 --> 00:32:23,632
Now the bell will ring.

433
00:32:24,008 --> 00:32:25,134
Everyone will go to their classes.

434
00:32:25,343 --> 00:32:27,140
We'll have to wait here
for another 1 1/2 hr.

435
00:32:27,345 --> 00:32:29,643
l'll make her come out the class.

436
00:32:29,847 --> 00:32:32,873
What do you think of me?
This is our college.

437
00:32:33,084 --> 00:32:35,143
We had spent 4 yrs. studying here.

438
00:32:35,520 --> 00:32:40,389
Do you know l made this college principal
drink his first peg of liquor?

439
00:32:40,591 --> 00:32:41,922
Actually, he was my professor.

440
00:32:42,393 --> 00:32:44,452
Go. But beware of boys.

441
00:32:44,662 --> 00:32:46,493
What boys!

442
00:33:20,732 --> 00:33:23,462
l came in search of you.
Please come.

443
00:33:25,837 --> 00:33:26,769
Come l say.

444
00:33:33,911 --> 00:33:38,974
l would like to marry you.
Do you have any objection?

445
00:33:41,085 --> 00:33:43,781
lf you've any problem, just tell me now.

446
00:33:43,955 --> 00:33:46,321
l feel disturbed. That's why l came here.

447
00:33:46,524 --> 00:33:51,894
Since when are you disturbed?
- From the moment l saw you.

448
00:33:53,698 --> 00:33:55,290
lt's better you change yourself.

449
00:33:58,269 --> 00:34:04,799
l'm very serious.
You don't have to reply right away.

450
00:34:05,710 --> 00:34:08,907
l couldn't stop myself saying this to you.
That's why l came here.

451
00:34:11,849 --> 00:34:14,079
Why did you come to college
early morning?

452
00:34:16,387 --> 00:34:19,015
l'm not here to create any problem.

453
00:34:19,424 --> 00:34:21,119
You don't have to reply to me.

454
00:34:21,559 --> 00:34:24,195
Malini sister or Ranjini will talk to you.

455
00:34:24,195 --> 00:34:25,662
Tell your decision to them.

456
00:34:26,197 --> 00:34:28,757
Till then, let this disturbance continue.

457
00:34:29,000 --> 00:34:29,932
l like it.

458
00:34:30,701 --> 00:34:33,602
l've nothing to say
to Malini sister or Ranjini.

459
00:34:33,805 --> 00:34:34,897
l tell you my decision right now.

460
00:34:35,106 --> 00:34:36,300
l don't like you.

461
00:34:40,311 --> 00:34:41,938
l've heard a lot about you.

462
00:34:42,146 --> 00:34:44,944
After seeing you, l realized that
you're more than what l heard about you.

463
00:34:46,017 --> 00:34:47,951
You want to be disturbed, right?

464
00:34:48,152 --> 00:34:49,881
But please relieve me out of it.

465
00:34:58,062 --> 00:35:04,626
Who is he? What is he to you? Shall we deal with him?

466
00:35:11,676 --> 00:35:16,136
Radha had ''Moolakuru'' problem in the morning.

467
00:35:16,347 --> 00:35:20,977
l mean Piles.

468
00:35:21,185 --> 00:35:24,712
Her mother sent me to know how she is.

469
00:35:25,223 --> 00:35:27,714
When l spoke to her,
her piles problem became worse.

470
00:35:28,059 --> 00:35:28,991
She is hot because of that.

471
00:35:29,127 --> 00:35:31,527
Don't worry my dear.
lt will pain for a while.

472
00:35:31,729 --> 00:35:32,718
You don't have to worry about that.

473
00:35:33,097 --> 00:35:34,462
Now, go to your class.

474
00:36:16,674 --> 00:36:20,110
Met her?
- l couldn't meet her.

475
00:36:20,645 --> 00:36:21,907
l told you, didn't l?

476
00:36:22,513 --> 00:36:23,571
What should we do now?

477
00:36:24,015 --> 00:36:25,915
Lets go.- Then...?

478
00:36:27,652 --> 00:36:31,816
We'll have lime juice.

479
00:36:35,927 --> 00:36:39,419
Lime juice? Now?

480
00:36:54,912 --> 00:36:57,574
Did it happen like that?

481
00:37:01,385 --> 00:37:02,409
lf she tells this to her family,

482
00:37:02,620 --> 00:37:03,552
won't everyone in our village
come to know about this?

483
00:37:03,754 --> 00:37:05,949
l don't care about that.

484
00:37:06,857 --> 00:37:07,824
lt's not that.

485
00:37:09,460 --> 00:37:11,985
Only now l realise how foolish l was.

486
00:37:13,064 --> 00:37:16,431
Should l have to worry about this?

487
00:37:16,968 --> 00:37:18,367
Why should l?

488
00:37:19,303 --> 00:37:21,271
She said she doesn't like me.

489
00:37:21,472 --> 00:37:25,909
l like her & everyone woman in this city.

490
00:37:26,043 --> 00:37:28,375
Now you'll see who l am.

491
00:37:29,213 --> 00:37:31,340
Drink & leave quickly.

492
00:37:31,849 --> 00:37:32,816
lf you stay here, you'll cause trouble.

493
00:37:33,484 --> 00:37:34,473
You've a bus now.

494
00:37:34,986 --> 00:37:36,920
Or else l'll take you in my scooter.

495
00:37:37,321 --> 00:37:40,586
Don't stay in this town
with your disturbed mind.

496
00:37:42,393 --> 00:37:43,155
No need.

497
00:37:54,105 --> 00:37:55,129
Please sit.

498
00:38:08,185 --> 00:38:10,346
How did you know that l was here?

499
00:38:10,554 --> 00:38:12,749
To be frank,
l would've phoned your home in 2 days.

500
00:38:15,926 --> 00:38:17,723
There is something you have to see.

501
00:38:17,928 --> 00:38:18,917
Nothing.

502
00:38:19,797 --> 00:38:21,628
lt is to discuss some personal matter.

503
00:38:22,133 --> 00:38:24,067
Okay, l'll move. You continue.

504
00:38:24,669 --> 00:38:26,296
l've some work in my shop.

505
00:38:28,239 --> 00:38:32,335
Better don't create new problems.

506
00:38:33,077 --> 00:38:36,069
Don't even offer him a drop of liquor.

507
00:38:36,414 --> 00:38:37,711
He is very upset.

508
00:38:37,915 --> 00:38:39,212
Really...?
- He is joking.

509
00:38:40,384 --> 00:38:41,043
Bye.

510
00:38:46,490 --> 00:38:48,458
What is so personal you want to discuss?

511
00:38:48,793 --> 00:38:51,956
A small favour.

512
00:38:52,730 --> 00:38:55,893
Favour...?
For you? From me?

513
00:38:56,400 --> 00:38:57,389
Tell me what it is.

514
00:38:57,601 --> 00:38:58,898
There is something.

515
00:38:59,437 --> 00:39:02,668
We'll talk about it having a beer?
- No.

516
00:39:03,741 --> 00:39:06,539
Lets not discuss about it now.

517
00:39:07,078 --> 00:39:10,946
l thought of coming to your house
& discuss it.

518
00:39:12,283 --> 00:39:14,217
What is so serious about it?

519
00:39:14,418 --> 00:39:18,821
lt's about bringing a new girl
into this profession.

520
00:39:22,226 --> 00:39:25,593
We've our own place.
Lets go there & talk.

521
00:39:25,996 --> 00:39:29,261
lf we stay here,
unnecessary thoughts will disturb us.

522
00:39:29,433 --> 00:39:30,627
That will create problems,

523
00:39:30,835 --> 00:39:31,893
which in turn makes things more difficult.

524
00:39:32,103 --> 00:39:32,967
Come.

525
00:39:44,215 --> 00:39:46,183
l think this is the address.
Read it.

526
00:39:47,184 --> 00:39:48,617
Clara.- Yes.

527
00:39:49,286 --> 00:39:52,187
Who is this Clara?

528
00:39:52,390 --> 00:39:54,187
ls she into this profession?

529
00:39:54,392 --> 00:39:56,519
lf she is in this profession,
why would l disturb you?

530
00:39:57,395 --> 00:39:59,863
She must get introduced into my profession.

531
00:40:00,197 --> 00:40:03,166
What for?
- For my livelihood.

532
00:40:04,468 --> 00:40:12,102
l & her step mother have planned
to bring her to this profession.

533
00:40:12,643 --> 00:40:14,201
That's why l'm giving you this address.

534
00:40:16,213 --> 00:40:19,205
What should we do with this address?

535
00:40:19,417 --> 00:40:20,850
We have to write a letter to this address,

536
00:40:21,252 --> 00:40:24,380
as if Mother Superior
of a church around here.

537
00:40:24,588 --> 00:40:26,215
Should l write the letter?

538
00:40:26,390 --> 00:40:29,484
l came for your help
because l'm an illeterate.

539
00:40:29,994 --> 00:40:32,622
What should Mother Superior write?

540
00:40:32,830 --> 00:40:34,127
l'll tell you.

541
00:40:34,331 --> 00:40:36,356
But before that,
you must know who she is,

542
00:40:36,567 --> 00:40:39,798
who are her relatives & more.

543
00:40:39,937 --> 00:40:42,599
When did you first see her?

544
00:40:42,807 --> 00:40:45,537
l met her in this town a year back,

545
00:40:45,743 --> 00:40:49,577
in a group which had come for an excursion.

546
00:40:49,780 --> 00:40:51,645
l noticed her then.

547
00:40:51,816 --> 00:40:53,977
l saw her last week.

548
00:40:57,455 --> 00:41:00,822
Just because l'm old, no one suspects me.

549
00:41:01,025 --> 00:41:02,652
That's how l met her.
- Then what?

550
00:41:02,760 --> 00:41:04,819
Her mother is dead. She lives with her father.

551
00:41:05,062 --> 00:41:07,895
And her qualification?
- She had failed in her pre-degree.

552
00:41:08,199 --> 00:41:09,496
Her father is a drunkard.

553
00:41:09,700 --> 00:41:13,727
Because of that,
she has financial problems at home.

554
00:41:13,971 --> 00:41:15,233
She has a step-mother.

555
00:41:15,506 --> 00:41:18,168
Her step-mother's children
are her only relatives.

556
00:41:18,375 --> 00:41:20,673
Have you been to her house?- Yes.

557
00:41:20,878 --> 00:41:23,438
l met her step-mother.
- Then...?

558
00:41:23,714 --> 00:41:26,842
She was expecting a person like me.

559
00:41:27,151 --> 00:41:32,145
She had planned to bring Clara
to this profession long back.

560
00:41:33,290 --> 00:41:34,689
We should first get Clara
join the christian missionary.

561
00:41:34,892 --> 00:41:37,122
We got her father's permission too.

562
00:41:37,328 --> 00:41:42,459
This letter is to convince
her mother's brother.

563
00:41:42,666 --> 00:41:43,633
The letter will be from the missionary.

564
00:41:43,834 --> 00:41:45,199
On seeing the letter,
she will come out.

565
00:41:45,402 --> 00:41:46,801
We shouldn't go there for some days.

566
00:41:47,004 --> 00:41:49,063
l had promised her step mother
that l'll give the letter.

567
00:41:49,306 --> 00:41:52,434
l don't know how to write
like a mother superior.

568
00:41:52,643 --> 00:41:55,874
lt is just a formality.
lt'll be fine.

569
00:41:56,080 --> 00:41:58,548
But still, we do need their letter head,
don't we?

570
00:41:58,749 --> 00:42:00,148
That's not a matter of concern.

571
00:42:00,317 --> 00:42:02,308
lf nothing works out,
we'll print one.

572
00:42:02,987 --> 00:42:05,182
l'll come tomorrow morning with all these.

573
00:42:05,389 --> 00:42:08,449
You be ready with the contents.

574
00:42:09,026 --> 00:42:12,120
As that boy said, go home
& don't drink any lime juice.

575
00:42:38,455 --> 00:42:42,016
''May god bless you''

576
00:42:42,960 --> 00:42:45,258
To dear Clara,

577
00:43:25,102 --> 00:43:28,503
l was very happy to read your letters.

578
00:43:29,740 --> 00:43:37,306
By god's grace, l'm happy to inform you that
you've been selected to serve god.

579
00:43:38,215 --> 00:43:44,814
You & your step-mother
must come to the missionary on 23rd.

580
00:43:56,567 --> 00:44:02,096
Your step-mother can stay here
for a couple of days.

581
00:44:10,714 --> 00:44:16,346
We feel very happy on your growth.

582
00:44:24,895 --> 00:44:29,992
While coming, bring snacks to eat.

583
00:46:05,129 --> 00:46:07,461
You shouldn't have been
so rude to him.

584
00:46:07,664 --> 00:46:10,292
What else can l do?
There is a limit to everything.

585
00:46:10,501 --> 00:46:12,469
He is both stingy & shameless.

586
00:46:12,903 --> 00:46:15,633
Since l was so rude to him,
he won't disturb me anymore.

587
00:46:16,240 --> 00:46:19,368
After his visit to college,
boys have something to talk about.

588
00:46:19,576 --> 00:46:21,703
Now boys have given me a nick name.
- Nick name?

589
00:46:22,379 --> 00:46:24,404
lt has started.
- What do they call you?

590
00:46:26,116 --> 00:46:27,481
Really?

591
00:46:29,019 --> 00:46:29,917
Shit!

592
00:46:39,096 --> 00:46:40,586
Did Jaikrishnan of Mannarthuudi
met you in college?

593
00:46:40,798 --> 00:46:42,595
Yes. How did you know that?

594
00:46:42,800 --> 00:46:44,529
Brother of a girl studying there told me.

595
00:46:44,735 --> 00:46:46,794
So, that has become the hot news, ah?

596
00:46:47,004 --> 00:46:48,096
Radha, come inside.

597
00:46:50,107 --> 00:46:52,940
l wonder what else is going
to happen. Rogue!

598
00:46:57,681 --> 00:46:58,807
When l told him to get lost,

599
00:46:59,016 --> 00:47:03,680
he started to blabber like a lunatic.
That's all.

600
00:47:03,887 --> 00:47:06,048
He must be knowing
that you are my sister.

601
00:47:06,256 --> 00:47:08,224
He knows & he even told me.

602
00:47:09,893 --> 00:47:15,263
lf he approches you again,
inform me.

603
00:47:16,099 --> 00:47:19,193
Approch you? That's impossible.

604
00:47:19,336 --> 00:47:21,702
He got very nicely from me.

605
00:47:21,905 --> 00:47:25,363
He must be after someother girl by now.

606
00:47:25,576 --> 00:47:28,602
No. You must be careful at this point.

607
00:47:30,113 --> 00:47:32,343
l know him for many years.

608
00:47:32,549 --> 00:47:35,484
l can narrate you 100 different stores
about him.

609
00:47:35,686 --> 00:47:41,716
But this is first time
Jayakrishnan has approched a girl.

610
00:47:41,992 --> 00:47:43,289
The first time.

611
00:47:43,493 --> 00:47:48,590
l think, since you had been very rude
to him, he must have felt hurt.

612
00:47:49,600 --> 00:47:54,435
Not even his close friends
can predict his next move.

613
00:47:54,605 --> 00:47:58,405
Once he takes a decision,
he never steps back.

614
00:47:58,775 --> 00:48:01,972
He has people to anything
for him in this town.

615
00:48:02,179 --> 00:48:02,907
Do you know that?

616
00:48:03,847 --> 00:48:04,905
That's why l'm telling you,

617
00:48:05,115 --> 00:48:08,312
if he approaches you at anytime,
inform me.

618
00:48:08,518 --> 00:48:09,314
Got it?

619
00:48:10,587 --> 00:48:11,554
Now you can go.

620
00:48:57,768 --> 00:48:58,735
l don't recognize you.

621
00:48:58,936 --> 00:49:02,895
Mannarkudi Jayakrishnan...
- This is his house.

622
00:49:03,106 --> 00:49:05,233
He is inside. l'll call him.

623
00:49:05,609 --> 00:49:06,541
Please sit inside.

624
00:49:07,177 --> 00:49:10,635
Where are you coming from?
- Actually...

625
00:49:10,948 --> 00:49:13,212
l haven't seen you before.

626
00:49:13,417 --> 00:49:16,181
l come here very rarely.

627
00:49:16,520 --> 00:49:25,189
Master, how come you are here?

628
00:49:26,697 --> 00:49:28,062
Mother, don't you know Kurukkal master?

629
00:49:28,265 --> 00:49:29,823
He was my teacher
when l was in 5th class.

630
00:49:30,033 --> 00:49:31,261
Kurukkal master.

631
00:49:31,468 --> 00:49:33,527
lt's been very long since we met.

632
00:49:33,737 --> 00:49:35,568
How did you remember me now?

633
00:49:35,772 --> 00:49:37,831
Please sit inside. Come.

634
00:49:48,785 --> 00:49:51,345
Sit...please sit.

635
00:49:54,925 --> 00:49:57,553
What would you like to have?
Coffee or horlicks?

636
00:49:57,761 --> 00:49:59,058
No thanks.

637
00:49:59,262 --> 00:50:02,891
No way. You must have something.

638
00:50:03,133 --> 00:50:06,728
Tea. You don't drink tea, do you?

639
00:50:06,937 --> 00:50:08,063
very good memory.

640
00:50:08,271 --> 00:50:09,363
You were the same when you were a kid.

641
00:50:10,407 --> 00:50:12,204
He is stubborn even now.

642
00:50:13,443 --> 00:50:18,107
We can give him a lime juice.

643
00:50:18,849 --> 00:50:19,679
ls that enough?

644
00:50:19,750 --> 00:50:21,149
Yes, that's enough.

645
00:50:23,020 --> 00:50:23,952
Would you like to have tender coconut?

646
00:50:24,154 --> 00:50:25,985
No. Lime juice is enough.

647
00:50:32,095 --> 00:50:34,620
The girl has come.- Who?

648
00:50:34,831 --> 00:50:35,627
Clara.

649
00:50:43,774 --> 00:50:47,107
Mother, do you have oats?- Yes.

650
00:50:47,310 --> 00:50:50,939
Mix it with banana & bring it.

651
00:50:51,281 --> 00:50:52,771
Master is very hungry.

652
00:50:52,983 --> 00:50:55,076
He felt little shy to tell you.

653
00:50:55,285 --> 00:50:57,583
Till then,
l'll show him our house & lands.

654
00:51:02,192 --> 00:51:04,319
She is with her step-mother.

655
00:51:06,029 --> 00:51:08,395
You must also do me another favour.

656
00:51:09,132 --> 00:51:10,861
You must find out what's in her heart.

657
00:51:11,201 --> 00:51:12,498
How can l?

658
00:51:12,769 --> 00:51:17,866
l came for your help because
l don't trust anyone else.

659
00:51:18,975 --> 00:51:20,840
lf l could get her,

660
00:51:21,144 --> 00:51:24,409
my business will go on even
if l don't have other girls.

661
00:51:24,748 --> 00:51:25,806
She'll also be profited.

662
00:51:26,316 --> 00:51:28,443
very huge profits.

663
00:51:29,252 --> 00:51:33,188
But we have find out whether
she is our kind of a girl.

664
00:51:33,890 --> 00:51:36,757
Don't you know how to bring girls
to your profession?

665
00:51:36,960 --> 00:51:39,360
l knew it is difficult
from the moment l saw her.

666
00:51:39,563 --> 00:51:41,622
What do you want me to do?

667
00:51:41,832 --> 00:51:43,299
Nothing much.

668
00:51:43,500 --> 00:51:44,990
Come with me to town.

669
00:51:45,202 --> 00:51:47,136
lf possible,
stay for a couple of days.

670
00:51:47,337 --> 00:51:49,805
Tell your mom that l've a problem
to be solved & come with me.

671
00:51:50,006 --> 00:51:52,031
You must find out what's in her heart.

672
00:51:52,742 --> 00:51:53,674
What do you mean?

673
00:51:53,877 --> 00:52:00,146
l want to know whether if someone
offers her a bungalow & a car,

674
00:52:00,350 --> 00:52:03,012
will she accept that offer
& go with him?

675
00:52:04,354 --> 00:52:06,914
What a job!?

676
00:52:19,870 --> 00:52:24,170
What contractor?
- Kunjnu's contractor.

677
00:52:24,374 --> 00:52:25,534
Don't change the name.

678
00:52:25,976 --> 00:52:27,238
Kunjnu's contractor.

679
00:52:40,957 --> 00:52:41,651
Please get inside.

680
00:52:49,966 --> 00:52:52,662
This is the best suit available.

681
00:52:52,869 --> 00:52:53,858
Please sit.

682
00:52:56,540 --> 00:52:58,269
l told you about the Kunjnu's contractor,
didn't l?

683
00:52:58,475 --> 00:52:59,407
Yes...

684
00:53:00,443 --> 00:53:01,171
Where is she?

685
00:53:06,216 --> 00:53:08,377
There she is.

686
00:53:13,557 --> 00:53:15,923
Kunjnu's contractor.
A big timber merchant.

687
00:53:18,662 --> 00:53:20,493
Please sit.- No, l like to stand.

688
00:53:21,331 --> 00:53:25,665
Please come here.
- Come & sit here.

689
00:53:31,441 --> 00:53:32,908
Shall l order for soda?

690
00:53:40,951 --> 00:53:42,350
What's it?

691
00:53:43,053 --> 00:53:48,423
l've seen people drinking in the evenings,
but you....

692
00:53:50,460 --> 00:53:51,324
lt is funny to her.

693
00:53:51,528 --> 00:53:55,089
She thinks l'm talking
about her drunkard father.

694
00:53:57,033 --> 00:53:59,524
What's your name?

695
00:53:59,736 --> 00:54:01,670
My name is Glory.

696
00:54:05,942 --> 00:54:08,706
Since everyone call me that way,
it has become my name.

697
00:54:10,213 --> 00:54:12,681
Now, l like that name.

698
00:54:20,957 --> 00:54:22,049
They will bring soda in a moment.

699
00:54:22,892 --> 00:54:24,257
The brief...

700
00:54:25,395 --> 00:54:27,329
Are you going to be here
till the soda comes?

701
00:54:27,530 --> 00:54:29,361
Oh! No way.

702
00:54:45,749 --> 00:54:48,309
That's 310. This is 31 1 .

703
00:54:48,518 --> 00:54:51,078
lf you need anything, just call.

704
00:54:52,155 --> 00:54:54,282
Your daughter is very lucky.

705
00:54:54,758 --> 00:54:58,159
One should fall in the
right hands to come up in life.

706
00:54:58,361 --> 00:55:00,488
Who do you think he is?
- ls he very rich?

707
00:55:01,164 --> 00:55:03,655
lf he likes her, he'll treat her like a queen.

708
00:55:04,267 --> 00:55:05,291
lt's true.

709
00:55:08,772 --> 00:55:11,036
l'll meet you later.

710
00:55:17,480 --> 00:55:20,972
Why haven't you fallen in love till now?

711
00:55:21,051 --> 00:55:22,245
lt isn't true, is it?

712
00:55:22,452 --> 00:55:24,215
Why should l lie to you?

713
00:55:24,821 --> 00:55:26,413
So, you never felt like falling in love.

714
00:55:26,623 --> 00:55:29,683
What is the reason?
- How do l know?

715
00:55:29,926 --> 00:55:33,089
The men l met aren't qualified for that.

716
00:55:33,229 --> 00:55:35,561
Am l qualified?

717
00:55:36,032 --> 00:55:37,260
What is the use of it?

718
00:55:37,467 --> 00:55:39,298
You've a wife & children.

719
00:55:39,402 --> 00:55:42,860
What should l ruin your happy family life?

720
00:55:47,143 --> 00:55:49,270
l will ask you something.
Will you tell me the truth?

721
00:55:50,146 --> 00:55:51,010
Go ahead.

722
00:55:51,715 --> 00:55:55,549
ls it your own decision?
- Yes.

723
00:55:55,985 --> 00:55:57,111
What is the reason?

724
00:55:59,356 --> 00:56:02,951
Did l ask you the reason
for coming here?

725
00:56:03,159 --> 00:56:03,921
l didn't.

726
00:56:05,395 --> 00:56:06,191
No.

727
00:59:39,042 --> 00:59:41,408
You haven't had sex with anyone before,
have you?

728
01:00:09,606 --> 01:00:11,130
l didn't know that.

729
01:00:13,776 --> 01:00:15,835
l thought you had sex before.

730
01:00:38,735 --> 01:00:40,669
From the day l knew,
it is quarrel everyday.

731
01:00:40,903 --> 01:00:43,531
l was fed up with my life.
So...

732
01:00:44,440 --> 01:00:46,567
Quarrel with whom? ls it Beatrice?

733
01:00:46,776 --> 01:00:48,175
l used to quarrel much with her.

734
01:00:48,745 --> 01:00:50,872
She fights with me for every reason.

735
01:00:51,147 --> 01:00:52,739
First she used to beat me.

736
01:00:53,249 --> 01:00:56,446
When l lost control,
l slapped her once.

737
01:00:57,120 --> 01:00:59,247
After that incident,
we fight everyday.

738
01:01:00,023 --> 01:01:01,513
And l started winning.

739
01:01:02,058 --> 01:01:06,256
lf l have to live in that house,
l must chose this profession.

740
01:01:06,763 --> 01:01:09,231
They themselves are finding ways
to push me in to this profession.

741
01:01:11,134 --> 01:01:13,466
Do you want to be saved from getting ruined?

742
01:01:14,604 --> 01:01:15,935
Anyway, l will get ruined.

743
01:01:16,072 --> 01:01:18,006
But let me get ruined by a good man.

744
01:01:18,207 --> 01:01:19,606
And l can die after
my desires get fulfilled?

745
01:01:47,270 --> 01:01:49,238
l think you didn't open the briefcase.

746
01:01:51,007 --> 01:01:52,099
Here is what you told me to buy.

747
01:01:52,308 --> 01:01:54,242
l don't know whether
this is what you asked for.

748
01:02:02,452 --> 01:02:03,384
Just a second.

749
01:02:19,902 --> 01:02:22,962
Are you telling the truth?
- Yes.

750
01:02:23,139 --> 01:02:27,007
She hadn't been touched
by a man till now.

751
01:02:31,814 --> 01:02:33,509
l didn't know that.

752
01:02:33,983 --> 01:02:36,850
May be she was waiting for you.

753
01:02:39,388 --> 01:02:41,948
l should'nt have done that.

754
01:02:42,759 --> 01:02:46,058
You must rather feel lucky.

755
01:02:47,497 --> 01:02:48,191
Forget it.

756
01:02:48,397 --> 01:02:50,957
Did you find out what's in her heart?

757
01:02:52,435 --> 01:02:54,062
Were you not able to find out
or was she very stubborn?

758
01:02:54,270 --> 01:02:55,362
l never asked her about that.

759
01:02:56,139 --> 01:02:59,540
And she is not easily understandble.

760
01:02:59,809 --> 01:03:00,969
l knew that.

761
01:03:01,177 --> 01:03:03,236
That's why l sought your help.

762
01:03:05,014 --> 01:03:07,141
l too don't think l'll be successful.

763
01:03:08,718 --> 01:03:13,121
Everygirl coming to this profession
has a soft story.

764
01:03:13,823 --> 01:03:16,758
l'll lose before her.

765
01:03:16,959 --> 01:03:18,256
Everything will be alright.

766
01:03:18,461 --> 01:03:19,985
First you open the briefcase.

767
01:03:20,196 --> 01:03:22,391
The mood will change. Come.

768
01:03:25,067 --> 01:03:27,399
l forgot to ask you.

769
01:03:28,171 --> 01:03:31,107
We know eachother
for more than 5 yrs, right?

770
01:03:31,107 --> 01:03:31,801
Yes.

771
01:03:32,208 --> 01:03:33,835
There are lot many stories between us.

772
01:03:35,144 --> 01:03:38,602
You used to trap girls,
enjoy & leave them.

773
01:03:38,815 --> 01:03:41,249
But in this, you got trapped, right?

774
01:03:43,152 --> 01:03:47,418
Like her,
is this the first time for you too?

775
01:03:52,061 --> 01:03:52,686
Yes.

776
01:04:07,076 --> 01:04:12,810
l'll get you a beautiful bungalow.

777
01:04:13,749 --> 01:04:17,276
A bungalow costing Rs. 7 - 8.

778
01:04:17,420 --> 01:04:20,548
Rs. 8 means, a cartboard house?

779
01:04:21,557 --> 01:04:26,426
Rs. 8 means 8 lacs.

780
01:04:31,167 --> 01:04:39,074
Grinder, mixie, Tv...
a fully furnished house.

781
01:04:40,610 --> 01:04:45,138
And a Maruthi...
a green coloured one.

782
01:04:45,781 --> 01:04:48,773
To girls like you,
Maruthi is the best.

783
01:04:48,985 --> 01:04:50,145
Maruthi is enough.

784
01:04:50,953 --> 01:04:52,113
Will you teach me how to drive?

785
01:04:52,255 --> 01:04:59,093
You think l'm kidding.
- No.

786
01:04:59,262 --> 01:05:02,095
You didn't have a drop of liquor.

787
01:05:02,298 --> 01:05:07,930
You made me drink a bottle of whisky
and enjoying?

788
01:05:09,906 --> 01:05:11,999
Dear, are you enjoying?

789
01:05:17,146 --> 01:05:19,341
You don't have to enjoy that way.

790
01:05:19,548 --> 01:05:21,448
Lets go to the beach

791
01:05:21,784 --> 01:05:22,614
Beach?

792
01:05:23,319 --> 01:05:26,015
Beach behind this coconut groove.

793
01:05:26,222 --> 01:05:27,655
A beautiful beach.

794
01:05:27,857 --> 01:05:30,417
l don't want to go.
Don't be crazy.

795
01:05:30,626 --> 01:05:33,493
Breathing fresh air
in the beach means crazy to you?

796
01:05:34,196 --> 01:05:36,061
Breathing fresh air
in the evenings aren't crazy.

797
01:05:36,265 --> 01:05:38,165
But going to breathe fresh air
at night are crazy.

798
01:05:38,367 --> 01:05:40,130
ls this the law?- Yes.

799
01:05:40,236 --> 01:05:43,967
Lets break that law.
Come.

800
01:05:46,208 --> 01:05:48,369
Why are you rubbing against me?

801
01:05:52,181 --> 01:05:54,843
So, you know everyone around here?
- Yes.

802
01:05:56,519 --> 01:05:57,850
What would the hotel men think about us?

803
01:05:58,020 --> 01:06:00,011
Who cares what they think about us?

804
01:06:00,222 --> 01:06:02,554
Now, l'm going to buy this hotel.

805
01:06:02,758 --> 01:06:05,158
Want to see that?

806
01:06:07,964 --> 01:06:09,261
What hotel is this!?

807
01:06:09,532 --> 01:06:12,092
Full of steps.

808
01:06:25,314 --> 01:06:28,511
Why are repeating the same thing?

809
01:06:30,219 --> 01:06:33,416
Because you didn't give me perfect reply.

810
01:06:35,224 --> 01:06:37,590
l don't want to be a concubine.

811
01:06:38,461 --> 01:06:39,655
ls that enough?

812
01:06:41,163 --> 01:06:46,294
What's the reason?
- l know the reason.

813
01:06:46,602 --> 01:06:49,503
There are many people waiting
to make me their concubine.

814
01:06:50,106 --> 01:06:53,337
Let me count the number of people
who want me to be their concubine.

815
01:06:58,581 --> 01:06:59,809
Even if l wish to,

816
01:07:00,016 --> 01:07:01,847
do you want me to be
a timber contractor's concubine?

817
01:07:02,284 --> 01:07:05,549
l can rather search for prospective customer.

818
01:07:11,293 --> 01:07:17,459
very greedy.
- What did you say? Come again

819
01:07:19,101 --> 01:07:21,797
very greedy!

820
01:07:45,528 --> 01:07:48,759
O timber merchant!

821
01:07:50,466 --> 01:07:54,766
Who are you? Tell me the truth.

822
01:07:58,641 --> 01:08:06,013
l know whatever you said from morning
till now is a lie.

823
01:08:06,816 --> 01:08:10,308
Only because of that,
l told you the truth.

824
01:08:10,820 --> 01:08:14,221
But we both have to be united.

825
01:08:14,690 --> 01:08:18,023
lf you tell me the truth,
it'll be useful for both of us.

826
01:08:19,328 --> 01:08:20,295
Tell me the truth.

827
01:08:20,463 --> 01:08:21,555
Everything will come good.

828
01:08:28,904 --> 01:08:34,206
l'm...

829
01:08:37,113 --> 01:08:41,573
l'm mother superior.

830
01:08:45,121 --> 01:08:46,247
l guessed.

831
01:09:22,291 --> 01:09:29,197
lf Radha wasn't rude to me,
l wouldn't have met Clara.

832
01:09:31,333 --> 01:09:36,430
l might have met you,
but not this way.

833
01:09:39,108 --> 01:09:43,067
l had controlled myself all these years
without losing to any woman.

834
01:09:44,947 --> 01:09:52,854
l kept myself in a nutshell so as to give
myself to a woman l liked.

835
01:09:53,989 --> 01:09:59,757
From now on,
l'm afraid that l may try everyone.

836
01:10:00,896 --> 01:10:01,920
Nothing like that.

837
01:10:02,731 --> 01:10:04,198
You meet Radha once more.

838
01:10:05,901 --> 01:10:09,234
Not in the college.
But somewhere else.

839
01:10:13,242 --> 01:10:14,209
She will come.

840
01:10:16,011 --> 01:10:19,208
One day you will find her in Mannarthudi.

841
01:10:21,317 --> 01:10:23,649
You'll have 3-4 children.

842
01:10:25,821 --> 01:10:28,813
And l will come to see that.

843
01:10:39,635 --> 01:10:40,897
a bit of evil,

844
01:10:41,937 --> 01:10:43,029
l'm a mixture of all these.

845
01:10:43,339 --> 01:10:44,169
l knew it.

846
01:10:44,406 --> 01:10:48,740
And today,
Clara broke my stubborness.

847
01:10:49,878 --> 01:10:57,148
l never wanted to be the firstman
to spoil a girl's life.

848
01:10:58,454 --> 01:11:04,757
l never wanted to be a cause
for a girl to lose her virginity.

849
01:11:06,962 --> 01:11:17,668
lf that happens,
l had taken a vow to make her my wife.

850
01:11:20,209 --> 01:11:24,270
l would like to marry you.

851
01:11:32,721 --> 01:11:34,313
You don't have any problem,
do you?

852
01:11:36,091 --> 01:11:36,785
No.

853
01:11:38,894 --> 01:11:41,192
But you have change your caste.

854
01:11:42,765 --> 01:11:44,562
What do you mean?
- To go into the sea.

855
01:11:45,668 --> 01:11:46,635
We'll go.

856
01:11:47,336 --> 01:11:48,360
lt's not enough if you go.

857
01:11:48,570 --> 01:11:51,334
While coming back,
you must make some catch.

858
01:11:51,774 --> 01:11:54,072
ls it enough if you have anything
in the net?

859
01:11:54,176 --> 01:11:54,972
ls that enough?

860
01:11:55,177 --> 01:11:55,939
Then...?

861
01:11:56,679 --> 01:11:58,306
l want the boat full of...
