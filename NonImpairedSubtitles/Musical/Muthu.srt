1
00:03:58,109 --> 00:03:59,843
Don't play the fool
with me

2
00:03:59,844 --> 00:04:02,045
Do you think everyone is
scared of Muthu!

3
00:04:02,046 --> 00:04:04,648
He's also a servant like
you and me

4
00:04:04,649 --> 00:04:05,734
Welcome Muthu

5
00:04:07,385 --> 00:04:08,460
That's Muthu

6
00:04:08,586 --> 00:04:11,361
He's not like us
He's different

7
00:04:17,829 --> 00:04:20,130
It's quite sometime since
Mother sat for the Prayer

8
00:04:20,131 --> 00:04:22,332
If the Landlord doesn't come,when
she performs the final ritual

9
00:04:22,333 --> 00:04:23,934
We'll not only
get scoldings

10
00:04:23,935 --> 00:04:25,168
Even the birthday benefits
will be with held.

11
00:04:25,169 --> 00:04:26,403
Go,wakeup the Landlord

12
00:04:26,404 --> 00:04:28,438
Don't talk rubbish
Rathi Devi.

13
00:04:28,439 --> 00:04:31,174
Can anyone wake him up
other than Muthu

14
00:04:31,175 --> 00:04:33,110
More over when Landlord
gets up

15
00:04:33,111 --> 00:04:35,779
Mother's order is,he must see
Muthu first,don't you know this

16
00:04:35,780 --> 00:04:36,785
I know that

17
00:04:36,848 --> 00:04:38,515
But today is not
an ordinary day

18
00:04:38,516 --> 00:04:40,250
Today's Landlord's birthday

19
00:04:40,251 --> 00:04:42,486
The Prayer is only for him,should'nt
he be present then

20
00:04:42,487 --> 00:04:44,288
What am I to do?
Muthu Isn't here!

21
00:04:44,289 --> 00:04:45,574
Where is Muthu?

22
00:04:46,557 --> 00:04:50,442
On the birthday of Landlord
where'll Muthu go?

23
00:04:56,567 --> 00:05:03,872
Oh God!let everyone without hassels
be peaceful & happy

24
00:05:15,019 --> 00:05:25,018
<i>Y DD</i>

25
00:06:27,058 --> 00:06:31,228
The Almighty is the master
rest of us are his servants

26
00:06:31,229 --> 00:06:35,030
Fools brood over fate
wisemen succeed it

27
00:06:47,745 --> 00:06:51,748
Why weapon to conquer earth
or tool to pluck flower

28
00:06:51,749 --> 00:06:56,124
Battle not for Wealth,control
desire to conquer earth

29
00:06:56,621 --> 00:07:06,620
<i>Y DD</i>

30
00:07:49,640 --> 00:07:57,104
Man desires for soil
soil desires for man

31
00:08:05,990 --> 00:08:13,454
Soil succeeds at last,But
Mind refuses to accept it!

32
00:08:14,332 --> 00:08:20,966
Sufficient money makes
you its boss

33
00:08:22,340 --> 00:08:29,804
Surplus money becomes
your boss

34
00:08:30,348 --> 00:08:34,863
Understand the meaning of life
and imbibe it completely

35
00:08:37,722 --> 00:08:47,721
<i>Y DD</i>

36
00:09:19,897 --> 00:09:27,361
Heaven to earth everything is
yours why to War on border problem

37
00:09:36,414 --> 00:09:44,049
Nature invites us to live
sufferings in life are artificial

38
00:09:44,589 --> 00:09:52,395
Birds enquire my
well being

39
00:09:52,763 --> 00:10:00,227
Buds call me by name
when they bloom

40
00:10:00,605 --> 00:10:04,620
I'll never age nor,sweetness
ever will be lost.

41
00:10:06,110 --> 00:10:16,109
<i>Y DD</i>

42
00:11:15,012 --> 00:11:17,013
Where's the Landlord,I'm going
to light the lamp

43
00:11:17,014 --> 00:11:18,348
He'll come right now

44
00:11:18,349 --> 00:11:26,655
It's getting late for Prayer
where's Muthu?

45
00:11:27,124 --> 00:11:28,609
Who's pushing me?

46
00:11:30,261 --> 00:11:32,129
Landlord is ready
he'll come now.

47
00:11:32,129 --> 00:11:35,165
We were getting bothered about
what Mother will say

48
00:11:35,166 --> 00:11:37,300
You've removed the
cause of my pain

49
00:11:37,301 --> 00:11:38,902
Thank God,Muthu
has come

50
00:11:38,903 --> 00:11:42,906
How did you get in here
without anyone's knowledge

51
00:11:42,907 --> 00:11:46,162
No one knows how and
when will I come

52
00:11:46,310 --> 00:11:49,635
But I'll be there at
the expected time

53
00:11:54,051 --> 00:11:54,884
What is this?

54
00:11:54,885 --> 00:11:56,240
Master is coming

55
00:12:32,590 --> 00:12:34,685
An I not on time,Mother?

56
00:12:35,760 --> 00:12:36,760
What is this?

57
00:12:36,761 --> 00:12:39,929
Who else will bless him on his
birthday other than you

58
00:12:39,930 --> 00:12:41,765
First let him be obedient
to his Mother

59
00:12:41,766 --> 00:12:43,451
Then I'll bless him

60
00:12:49,774 --> 00:12:52,609
Master,she's angry that you're
not married yet

61
00:12:52,610 --> 00:12:55,945
Mother,this year everything will
happen as per your wish

62
00:12:55,946 --> 00:12:58,615
For your next birthday
not as single

63
00:12:58,616 --> 00:13:00,950
But three persons will get
blessings from you

64
00:13:00,951 --> 00:13:03,921
His Wife,Child and himself.

65
00:13:06,457 --> 00:13:10,082
She's laughing,get her
blessings immediately

66
00:13:10,127 --> 00:13:13,296
Let everything happen fine as
what Muthu has said.

67
00:13:13,297 --> 00:13:14,297
OKay I'll take leave,Mother

68
00:13:14,298 --> 00:13:16,403
Where to...for the drama?

69
00:13:16,467 --> 00:13:19,636
Not at all,I don't go for
drama now a days

70
00:13:19,637 --> 00:13:21,137
Didn't you go for
drama yesterday?

71
00:13:21,138 --> 00:13:21,605
No

72
00:13:22,473 --> 00:13:23,958
Muthu you tell me

73
00:13:25,476 --> 00:13:26,309
We didn't go Mother.

74
00:13:26,310 --> 00:13:28,812
Promise on yourself
and tell me

75
00:13:28,813 --> 00:13:29,813
We didn't go
for drama

76
00:13:29,814 --> 00:13:31,648
When have you Brothered
about yourself?

77
00:13:31,649 --> 00:13:32,934
Promise on Raja

78
00:13:33,818 --> 00:13:35,103
Promise on Raja

79
00:13:35,820 --> 00:13:36,825
Tell me now

80
00:13:37,154 --> 00:13:37,819
Tell me

81
00:13:38,656 --> 00:13:40,990
We went for the drama
at Travancore

82
00:13:40,991 --> 00:13:42,826
We came back at 4.30
in the morning

83
00:13:42,827 --> 00:13:45,662
Since it's your birthday
you can't go for drama today

84
00:13:45,663 --> 00:13:46,830
The whole town is waiting
for you outside

85
00:13:46,831 --> 00:13:48,331
We've arranged a
grand party for them

86
00:13:48,332 --> 00:13:49,999
Today,you can't
go out anywhere

87
00:13:50,000 --> 00:13:52,001
No drama today,we
can sleep early

88
00:13:52,002 --> 00:13:54,337
We are going
- for the drama?

89
00:13:54,338 --> 00:13:56,303
No Mother,to the Temple

90
00:13:56,507 --> 00:13:58,007
Only to the Temple
Isn't it?

91
00:13:58,008 --> 00:13:59,903
Yes only to the Temple

92
00:14:04,181 --> 00:14:05,181
Why do you do this?

93
00:14:05,182 --> 00:14:06,516
Haven't I told you
not to do this

94
00:14:06,517 --> 00:14:08,351
He doesn't listen
to it at all.

95
00:14:08,352 --> 00:14:09,185
What is there in it?

96
00:14:09,186 --> 00:14:11,688
My existance is alms
that you've given

97
00:14:11,689 --> 00:14:13,356
Who else am I going to
serve otherthan you

98
00:14:13,357 --> 00:14:21,322
Landlord long live
Landlord long live...

99
00:14:35,880 --> 00:14:38,381
You go and arrange
flowers for the God

100
00:14:38,382 --> 00:14:39,737
Its already done

101
00:14:40,050 --> 00:14:42,719
Check whether preparations are
going on in the cusine

102
00:14:42,720 --> 00:14:43,386
I've checked that too

103
00:14:43,387 --> 00:14:45,722
Why do you send me away whenever
big master comes

104
00:14:45,723 --> 00:14:50,418
Today is Master's birthday
I won't go leaving him alone

105
00:14:59,737 --> 00:15:00,822
Welcome Uncle

106
00:15:01,572 --> 00:15:02,870
Birthday Wishes

107
00:15:10,414 --> 00:15:13,489
Long live Landlord
Long live Landlord

108
00:15:14,919 --> 00:15:23,385
Ambalathar longlive,Landlord
longlive,Ambalathar longlive

109
00:15:23,594 --> 00:15:28,559
The garland is put to greet
the person or to make him fall

110
00:15:28,933 --> 00:15:31,768
Muthu you both wanted to go to
the Temple,Isn't it, go

111
00:15:31,769 --> 00:15:32,936
Okay Mother
- Go

112
00:15:32,937 --> 00:15:33,937
Brother Veerapan
- Yes Muthu

113
00:15:33,938 --> 00:15:36,663
Hold this garland
- Okay give it

114
00:15:37,775 --> 00:15:39,609
We'll go
- Muthu save me

115
00:15:39,610 --> 00:15:42,325
Where's Brother
- I'm down here

116
00:15:42,780 --> 00:15:43,947
Come Muthu
- Yes master

117
00:15:43,948 --> 00:15:46,813
Have they put garland
or Mountain?

118
00:15:51,622 --> 00:15:54,123
Leaving,A palace like
Taj mahal

119
00:15:54,124 --> 00:15:56,960
Yet you're in this hut
I'm fuming inside

120
00:15:56,961 --> 00:15:59,816
Why do you let the
servants speak

121
00:16:00,297 --> 00:16:04,257
The God has made us superior
and them inferior

122
00:16:04,969 --> 00:16:07,870
But you don't know
where to keep them

123
00:16:07,871 --> 00:16:10,596
Why,have you forgotton
the past?

124
00:16:10,641 --> 00:16:14,456
I'm telling this because
we are inter related

125
00:16:14,645 --> 00:16:17,860
Has your daughter finished
her studies?

126
00:16:18,482 --> 00:16:19,987
Intelligent sister.

127
00:16:20,150 --> 00:16:22,819
What if my daughter completes
her studies or not

128
00:16:22,820 --> 00:16:24,153
I'll send her here

129
00:16:24,154 --> 00:16:25,321
You make her your
daughter-in-law

130
00:16:25,322 --> 00:16:27,357
I'll become your Kinsman

131
00:16:27,491 --> 00:16:31,916
Dear,don't mistake me for asking
you again and again

132
00:16:31,996 --> 00:16:34,998
Do you have any secrets
which I don't know

133
00:16:34,999 --> 00:16:39,564
Tell me,what the secret is
I'll suppress it completely

134
00:16:39,670 --> 00:16:43,007
It there anything
which I don't know?

135
00:16:43,007 --> 00:16:45,675
Then I'll make it known to
the whole town

136
00:16:45,676 --> 00:16:46,951
I'll leave now

137
00:16:59,023 --> 00:17:01,818
Are you taking care
of everything

138
00:17:01,859 --> 00:17:04,360
Yes Master,just
as you've said

139
00:17:04,361 --> 00:17:06,529
Have an eye on that
servent Muthu

140
00:17:06,530 --> 00:17:08,531
I already have one
eye on him

141
00:17:08,532 --> 00:17:10,867
Since you've mentioned it I'll
have both the eyes on him

142
00:17:10,868 --> 00:17:12,368
No one knows,who you are
isn't it

143
00:17:12,369 --> 00:17:13,369
How will they know?

144
00:17:13,370 --> 00:17:15,195
Don't shout you idiot

145
00:17:21,879 --> 00:17:24,881
Master why do richmen alone
celebrate birthdays

146
00:17:24,882 --> 00:17:26,716
Is it to spend
their money

147
00:17:26,717 --> 00:17:27,717
No,not only that

148
00:17:27,718 --> 00:17:32,013
To make everyone happy on their
birthday,That's why

149
00:17:32,389 --> 00:17:35,725
He makes everyone happy
except his Mother

150
00:17:35,726 --> 00:17:37,060
Always going for drama,cinema
and other entertainment

151
00:17:37,061 --> 00:17:39,395
I also have to
suffer with him

152
00:17:39,396 --> 00:17:40,229
What are you murmering
over there?

153
00:17:40,230 --> 00:17:41,925
Talking to my Friend

154
00:17:43,067 --> 00:17:45,382
When is your
birthday,Muthu

155
00:17:45,569 --> 00:17:46,724
My birthday...

156
00:17:47,071 --> 00:17:48,706
Good question,master

157
00:17:49,073 --> 00:17:54,168
I don't know,who my parents are
how will I know my birthday

158
00:18:31,949 --> 00:18:35,952
What's this,have we come for
theatre once again

159
00:18:35,953 --> 00:18:37,098
What is this?

160
00:18:55,806 --> 00:18:57,431
Who is this Mother?

161
00:18:57,474 --> 00:18:58,808
What,have you forgotton?

162
00:18:58,809 --> 00:19:01,144
Your Uncle's daughter,Padmini

163
00:19:01,145 --> 00:19:02,840
Is this our Padmini?

164
00:19:03,480 --> 00:19:05,855
She's looking
much grown up

165
00:19:06,984 --> 00:19:09,019
Look...She's feeling shy

166
00:19:10,154 --> 00:19:11,654
She has bumped on her
groom,isn't it

167
00:19:11,655 --> 00:19:12,655
That's why she's
feeling shy

168
00:19:12,656 --> 00:19:15,324
Why do you always talk
about my marriage

169
00:19:15,325 --> 00:19:17,994
Unlike her Father she's a
very nice girl

170
00:19:17,995 --> 00:19:19,996
I called her here,only
to know your opinion

171
00:19:19,997 --> 00:19:21,664
Am I not telling
my opinion often

172
00:19:21,665 --> 00:19:23,499
I'm not prepared
for marriage

173
00:19:23,500 --> 00:19:25,125
Send her back first

174
00:19:36,013 --> 00:19:39,228
What happened Padmini?
for this hiccups

175
00:19:41,185 --> 00:19:45,021
What do you know about hiccups
what do you know?

176
00:19:45,022 --> 00:19:45,354
Dear

177
00:19:45,355 --> 00:19:46,689
She's always like that

178
00:19:46,690 --> 00:19:51,195
She'll have hiccups for anger
happiness,temper and cry

179
00:19:51,361 --> 00:19:53,863
It isn't quite easy
to stop it

180
00:19:53,864 --> 00:19:55,531
I shall stop it,Mother

181
00:19:55,532 --> 00:19:57,533
Just like this
when I was a child

182
00:19:57,534 --> 00:19:58,868
I got hiccups quite often

183
00:19:58,869 --> 00:20:01,204
You know,what kind
of hiccups

184
00:20:01,205 --> 00:20:04,175
Mother will give me water

185
00:20:04,374 --> 00:20:06,008
I'll drink it
in one gulp

186
00:20:06,009 --> 00:20:08,934
In a short time hiccups
would stop

187
00:20:21,258 --> 00:20:23,059
Mother look the hiccups
have stoped

188
00:20:23,060 --> 00:20:25,061
That's why I
frightened him

189
00:20:25,062 --> 00:20:29,367
Hey!chinnapanne,your lower garment!
come on take it!

190
00:20:56,093 --> 00:20:59,288
Rathi,why am I doing
all your duties?

191
00:20:59,429 --> 00:21:02,098
You must see me
I must see you

192
00:21:02,099 --> 00:21:07,236
And our love must grow,but instead
of that you're dreaming about someting else!

193
00:21:07,237 --> 00:21:09,952
I'm getting a
dream quite often

194
00:21:10,140 --> 00:21:13,943
In that dream,a prince always
comes with a Sugar cane

195
00:21:13,944 --> 00:21:16,846
Since,its dark always,I am
not able to recognise him!

196
00:21:16,847 --> 00:21:19,316
It's none other than me

197
00:21:19,583 --> 00:21:21,784
Since he's black I can accept
it may be you.

198
00:21:21,785 --> 00:21:23,470
But,he's very thin!

199
00:21:23,520 --> 00:21:26,289
Am I not longing in
your thoughts?

200
00:21:26,290 --> 00:21:29,475
That's why,I look thin
in your dream

201
00:21:29,760 --> 00:21:31,727
Master,our little madam
- who's little madam?

202
00:21:31,728 --> 00:21:35,131
Padmini madam she's just like
actress Padmini

203
00:21:35,132 --> 00:21:36,361
Yes-Yes

204
00:21:37,434 --> 00:21:40,670
She's more bashful compared
to me,master!

205
00:21:40,671 --> 00:21:42,139
Yes-Yes

206
00:21:42,606 --> 00:21:45,441
Without any discrimination she's
affectionate towards everyone.

207
00:21:45,442 --> 00:21:47,035
Is it?-Yes

208
00:21:50,814 --> 00:21:52,581
Master look here this side!

209
00:21:52,582 --> 00:21:54,583
Look at the nature
God's creation

210
00:21:54,584 --> 00:21:57,119
Doesn't it look as a green carpet
spread on the earth!

211
00:21:57,120 --> 00:21:57,450
Yes

212
00:22:02,159 --> 00:22:02,964
Gone case

213
00:22:03,460 --> 00:22:05,328
Master,look at the sky

214
00:22:05,329 --> 00:22:07,930
Doesn't it look like a silver Bedspread
which has been spread on us!

215
00:22:07,931 --> 00:22:08,398
Yes

216
00:22:11,735 --> 00:22:14,136
My God where shall I ask him
to look at now?

217
00:22:14,137 --> 00:22:15,504
Master,look at the earth

218
00:22:15,505 --> 00:22:20,409
I've seen the Green carpet,silver
Bedspread and the posters also!

219
00:22:20,410 --> 00:22:22,712
Today, I must see that
"Pricess of Madurai"

220
00:22:22,713 --> 00:22:24,347
Ride the carriage straight
to Kovilur!

221
00:22:24,348 --> 00:22:26,603
Yet another sleepless night!

222
00:22:38,562 --> 00:22:40,387
Is he the hero
- Yes

223
00:22:41,031 --> 00:22:46,493
Minister haven't you found a
suitable bride for me

224
00:22:47,371 --> 00:22:49,670
Painful,ashamed,humiliating

225
00:22:50,540 --> 00:22:53,542
For a girl to suit your beauty
- stop

226
00:22:53,543 --> 00:22:55,878
What you said
wasn't audible?

227
00:22:55,879 --> 00:22:57,046
Repeat it once again

228
00:22:57,047 --> 00:22:59,692
For a girl to suit
your beauty

229
00:23:00,384 --> 00:23:04,389
There's no one to equal you
in the whole world

230
00:23:04,454 --> 00:23:06,889
If so,I've heard about world beauties
like cleopatra,Jhansi Rani!...

231
00:23:06,890 --> 00:23:08,724
Give whatever is needed to the
poor waiting outside

232
00:23:08,725 --> 00:23:10,059
Did you approach them?

233
00:23:10,060 --> 00:23:11,360
King,We saw them.

234
00:23:11,361 --> 00:23:16,493
But,they wouldn't stand before
your Golden colour!

235
00:23:17,067 --> 00:23:18,334
So we left them

236
00:23:18,335 --> 00:23:20,900
Wouldn't I get a
girl at all

237
00:23:24,741 --> 00:23:29,478
The good fortune of Marrying
you besttowed on only one girl!

238
00:23:29,479 --> 00:23:30,446
Who is that?

239
00:23:30,447 --> 00:23:32,313
Princes Malar Kodi

240
00:23:32,549 --> 00:23:34,541
Is it? Malar Kodi?!

241
00:23:34,785 --> 00:23:38,330
For my handsomness,is she
suitable for me?

242
00:23:39,923 --> 00:23:42,158
King don't underestimate her

243
00:23:42,159 --> 00:23:43,559
Her walk is like a swan!

244
00:23:43,560 --> 00:23:45,194
Her lips are intoxicating

245
00:23:45,195 --> 00:23:46,595
Her face is like Lotus

246
00:23:46,596 --> 00:23:48,364
Her body is Honey fruit

247
00:23:48,365 --> 00:23:50,334
Her age is 18

248
00:23:50,534 --> 00:23:52,268
On the whole she's a
never withring bud!

249
00:23:52,269 --> 00:23:55,330
Then I must see
her immediately!

250
00:23:55,539 --> 00:23:56,884
We must,we must

251
00:24:38,014 --> 00:24:41,817
Princess,the King of Pandyas
has come to seek your hand.

252
00:24:41,818 --> 00:24:44,186
Is it so,ask him to come
I'll meet him

253
00:24:44,187 --> 00:24:45,332
As you order!

254
00:24:47,424 --> 00:24:50,952
Princess,the King has come
look at him

255
00:24:59,669 --> 00:25:03,333
Pained,ashamed,humiliated

256
00:25:04,007 --> 00:25:05,902
Isn't this my dialogue

257
00:25:06,009 --> 00:25:09,044
To succed we must repeat
the dialogue

258
00:25:09,045 --> 00:25:11,347
Beauty queen,fascinating
princess

259
00:25:11,348 --> 00:25:15,223
I've got the figure that
men are attracted to

260
00:25:15,385 --> 00:25:21,390
Is he my bridegroom who looks like a
corpse walking out from grave yard!

261
00:25:24,728 --> 00:25:33,660
When the King's are ready to
leave their Kingdoms,for my one smile!

262
00:25:33,937 --> 00:25:35,771
How dare you've come to ask
for my hand,you coward?

263
00:25:35,772 --> 00:25:37,337
...On this earth...

264
00:25:42,913 --> 00:25:44,547
How dare you've come
to me,you coward?

265
00:25:44,548 --> 00:25:50,619
Not only in this world,even in 7 worlds
no mad girl will dare to marry you?

266
00:25:50,620 --> 00:25:54,189
How dare for a beast to
desire for a beauty?

267
00:25:54,190 --> 00:25:55,724
What do you think
of yourself?

268
00:25:55,725 --> 00:25:58,360
You are sneezing from
the beginning

269
00:25:58,361 --> 00:26:00,456
I'm talking only
to you

270
00:26:01,731 --> 00:26:02,731
You don't bother
sister

271
00:26:02,732 --> 00:26:04,667
I've been watching you from beginning
you're sneezing continuously

272
00:26:04,668 --> 00:26:06,402
What do you think
of your self?

273
00:26:06,403 --> 00:26:09,104
Is it a crime,even to sneeze
in this country?

274
00:26:09,105 --> 00:26:09,805
That's it!

275
00:26:09,806 --> 00:26:11,373
It isn't a crime
to sneeze...

276
00:26:11,374 --> 00:26:15,399
But when a beautiful girl is
performing on stage

277
00:26:15,946 --> 00:26:19,348
Madam,sneez,cough
hiccups,yawning...

278
00:26:19,549 --> 00:26:24,053
Good,bad,hungry,sleep,birth
death,money,merit,position...

279
00:26:24,054 --> 00:26:25,588
All these you wouldn't
get by asking!

280
00:26:25,589 --> 00:26:26,922
....It'll come to you
on its own!

281
00:26:26,923 --> 00:26:31,994
Neither we can ask why it has come
not ask why it goes from us!

282
00:26:31,995 --> 00:26:35,364
This is known as dialogue!
Muthu,you were brilliant!

283
00:26:35,365 --> 00:26:36,865
Even you too utter
dialogues

284
00:26:36,866 --> 00:26:39,468
It's easy to talk from
down there!

285
00:26:39,469 --> 00:26:42,271
Deliver it from here,shiver's will
run down from your back!

286
00:26:42,272 --> 00:26:45,007
Who'll shiver?what do you
think of our Muthu?

287
00:26:45,008 --> 00:26:48,277
The whole town is mesmerised by the
style of his Riding the carriage!

288
00:26:48,278 --> 00:26:50,913
He can ride carriages,can he
manage to get on to the stage?

289
00:26:50,914 --> 00:26:52,948
Whom are you questioning
like that?

290
00:26:52,949 --> 00:26:55,718
This is nothing for him
he'll get on to any stage!...

291
00:26:55,719 --> 00:26:58,554
...Speak boldly,Sing & Dance
Do you want to watch it?

292
00:26:58,555 --> 00:26:59,622
Why do you put me
in to a fix,boy?

293
00:26:59,623 --> 00:27:01,490
Shut up Muthu,you don't
know your potentials!

294
00:27:01,491 --> 00:27:04,484
If he's such a Bold man

295
00:27:04,728 --> 00:27:07,930
Tell him to come to stage
let him Sing & Dance,let's watch!

296
00:27:07,931 --> 00:27:11,100
Muthu how can you keep quiet
when she's challenging!

297
00:27:11,101 --> 00:27:12,468
Show your talent
on the stage

298
00:27:12,469 --> 00:27:14,136
Brother,I don't want all this
unnecessary trouble!

299
00:27:14,137 --> 00:27:16,438
Don't you want them to see
your talents?come on,Master!

300
00:27:16,439 --> 00:27:18,307
Hey!keep quiet!little girl
challenged unknowligly!

301
00:27:18,308 --> 00:27:20,473
He wouldn't
listen to us

302
00:27:20,610 --> 00:27:23,255
Lets get him on stage
by force

303
00:27:31,154 --> 00:27:31,987
Why is she so hot?

304
00:27:31,988 --> 00:27:35,190
You've got me here
how'll I manage her?

305
00:27:35,191 --> 00:27:37,327
Show them their places
we are there to back you!

306
00:27:37,327 --> 00:27:37,862
Master

307
00:27:49,172 --> 00:27:52,708
Oh!Princess!You've hurt a King
who had come to seek your hand!

308
00:27:52,709 --> 00:27:56,011
Don't seek a man's beauty on
his face,but in his heart!

309
00:27:56,012 --> 00:27:58,013
Instead of hurting
others heart

310
00:27:58,014 --> 00:28:04,477
The words of your reply...Repeat them
with a smile and watch the result!

311
00:28:05,355 --> 00:28:07,122
You'll understand the
sweetness in it

312
00:28:07,123 --> 00:28:10,178
That's good for you and
your family

313
00:28:10,326 --> 00:28:13,251
That's the merit of
language Tamil

314
00:28:15,365 --> 00:28:18,420
Don't be arrogant,it
will spoil you

315
00:28:24,040 --> 00:28:25,508
Sir,Wonderful

316
00:28:26,543 --> 00:28:28,377
Don't think you're great
because of the applause

317
00:28:28,378 --> 00:28:30,546
Only those applauses
have made men great

318
00:28:30,547 --> 00:28:32,214
Have you come to see drama
or pick up a fight?

319
00:28:32,215 --> 00:28:33,048
I'm not picking up a fight

320
00:28:33,049 --> 00:28:33,882
Is this Pride?

321
00:28:33,883 --> 00:28:34,717
I don't have that

322
00:28:34,718 --> 00:28:35,384
Then do I have?

323
00:28:35,385 --> 00:28:36,218
I don't say so

324
00:28:36,219 --> 00:28:38,053
What do you think
of yourself

325
00:28:38,054 --> 00:28:40,523
Generally my heart
is Gold

326
00:28:40,890 --> 00:28:44,285
When it comes to competition
I'm a Lion

327
00:28:50,900 --> 00:28:54,225
I'll speak the truth and
do Good deeds

328
00:28:57,073 --> 00:29:00,043
There'll be Victory
over Victory

329
00:29:00,243 --> 00:29:03,042
Let's Sing,dance and
celebrate

330
00:29:03,580 --> 00:29:06,209
Let there be joy always

331
00:29:24,768 --> 00:29:27,770
Ranga Nayagi for our
Sakthi drama troupe

332
00:29:27,771 --> 00:29:31,273
We've got a big asset
I mean a new Hero

333
00:29:31,274 --> 00:29:35,499
Invite him to the troupe by
Garlanding him,hold it

334
00:29:41,451 --> 00:29:44,246
Carefull it might sprain
too much

335
00:30:03,473 --> 00:30:05,638
You seem to be very Happy

336
00:30:06,810 --> 00:30:09,311
You used to ask me often
Isn't it

337
00:30:09,312 --> 00:30:11,814
That when I'm going
to Marry

338
00:30:11,815 --> 00:30:12,820
Now I've...

339
00:30:13,650 --> 00:30:16,035
Decided to get Married,Mother

Everybody come here

342
00:30:19,989 --> 00:30:23,484
Muthu,Landlord has accepted
for Marriage...

343
00:30:41,477 --> 00:30:47,212
Having seen a fish the crane
withdraws its fasting

344
00:30:56,593 --> 00:31:02,499
A fish has broken the Penance of
a Crane,Praying on leg!

345
00:31:11,541 --> 00:31:18,948
There's no eligible bachelor here!
Without'Love'there's no life here!

346
00:31:19,148 --> 00:31:26,521
You can't cover a sky!The love in
your eyes is taking steps!

347
00:31:29,325 --> 00:31:39,324
<i>Y DD</i>

348

Youthful young boy!Listen
to granny's words!

349
00:32:42,732 --> 00:32:49,434
There are rules in
Love life

350
00:32:50,239 --> 00:32:57,271
12 times express Love to
your wife in words

351
00:32:57,914 --> 00:33:04,616
Kiss her 6 times a day!

352
00:33:05,388 --> 00:33:12,295
Make her happy
thrice a day

353
00:33:12,962 --> 00:33:19,892
If this happens daily,she'll be at
your back & call all the time!

354
00:33:20,937 --> 00:33:30,936
<i>Y DD</i>

355
00:34:13,356 --> 00:34:20,524
Old Beauty,High priestess
of Love!

356
00:34:20,730 --> 00:34:27,534
You're a Doctorate
in 'Love Life'!

357
00:34:28,471 --> 00:34:35,674
Olden times were Golden Times!There
was only one thing that's'Love'!

358
00:34:36,045 --> 00:34:42,975
Presently men are struggling
Even for food!

359
00:34:43,619 --> 00:34:50,048
Nobody's living comfortably
to enjoy pleasures of life!

360
00:34:51,160 --> 00:34:58,397
You've time to Gossip about the town
What's life without a wife?

361
00:35:00,736 --> 00:35:10,735
<i>Y DD</i>

Happy news Brother that
too for you

364
00:35:51,821 --> 00:35:53,656
What's that?
- Father

365
00:35:53,990 --> 00:35:54,616
Beloved

366
00:35:55,324 --> 00:35:57,325
Has accepted for Marriage

367
00:35:57,326 --> 00:35:58,294
Only this

368
00:35:58,995 --> 00:36:00,662
You don't seem to react

369
00:36:00,663 --> 00:36:02,330
We are so much excited

370
00:36:02,331 --> 00:36:04,226
I knew he would accept

371
00:36:04,333 --> 00:36:06,168
That's why I send my
daughter here

372
00:36:06,169 --> 00:36:08,170
If not,I would have tried
some other way

373
00:36:08,171 --> 00:36:09,838
Fools have only one way

374
00:36:09,839 --> 00:36:11,673
This Ambalathar has
thousand ways

375
00:36:11,674 --> 00:36:13,508
But he hasn't given
me much trouble

376
00:36:13,509 --> 00:36:15,064
Give me the bottle

377
00:36:16,345 --> 00:36:17,370
Bridegroom...

378
00:36:20,850 --> 00:36:22,648
Welcome Bridegroom

379
00:36:23,186 --> 00:36:26,991
For others age goes up,for you
it comes down

380
00:36:27,023 --> 00:36:28,356
You look just the same

381
00:36:28,357 --> 00:36:31,832
My friend got this from
Singapore,have it

382
00:36:32,528 --> 00:36:34,029
what's this Master?

383
00:36:34,030 --> 00:36:35,185
Foreign Liqour

384
00:36:35,531 --> 00:36:40,202
Oh God,Master doesn't have this habit
don't teach him please

385
00:36:40,203 --> 00:36:41,831
Have it-No master

386
00:36:42,038 --> 00:36:43,705
Take your hands away
- No master

387
00:36:43,706 --> 00:36:47,041
I said take your hands away
- no master

388
00:36:49,212 --> 00:36:51,340
You bloody slave-Brother

389
00:36:55,384 --> 00:36:57,552
Ask pardon to muthu-what?!

390
00:36:57,553 --> 00:36:59,888
Should I ask Pardon
to a servant?

391
00:36:59,889 --> 00:37:01,984
No one is a servant here

392
00:37:02,058 --> 00:37:04,226
I treat everyone as
my Children

393
00:37:04,227 --> 00:37:07,896
Though I show all concern I've
never been rude to them

394
00:37:07,897 --> 00:37:09,862
How could you slap him?

395
00:37:09,899 --> 00:37:12,901
You might be my brother,you
have all rights over me

396
00:37:12,902 --> 00:37:15,237
But you don't have any
rights on them

397
00:37:15,238 --> 00:37:16,863
Ask pardon to Muthu

398
00:37:17,573 --> 00:37:20,858
Ambalathar has never asked
anyone pardon

399
00:37:21,244 --> 00:37:23,469
But I'm father
of a girl

400
00:37:25,748 --> 00:37:26,716
Pardon me

401
00:37:52,275 --> 00:37:53,608
What's this Ratidevi?

402
00:37:53,609 --> 00:37:55,443
Your hands are so soft
why do you work?

403
00:37:55,444 --> 00:37:59,229
Am I not there for you?
give me,I'll do it

404
00:38:02,618 --> 00:38:03,451
Shall we....

405
00:38:03,452 --> 00:38:05,120
Don't you have
any other work?

406
00:38:05,121 --> 00:38:07,455
Why do you wander like a dog
you broom

407
00:38:07,456 --> 00:38:11,626
Wait!why do you shout like goat
that's to be slaughered

408
00:38:11,627 --> 00:38:12,962
Yes,I am a dog

409
00:38:13,629 --> 00:38:16,414
Not an ordinary dog
but a Jackal

410
00:38:17,133 --> 00:38:20,118
Do you know what a
Jackal would do

411
00:38:26,642 --> 00:38:28,143
What's this,troubling women

412
00:38:28,144 --> 00:38:30,109
Then,can we trouble men

413
00:38:30,146 --> 00:38:32,147
Trouble me...trouble me...

414
00:38:32,148 --> 00:38:33,148
I've come to work

415
00:38:33,149 --> 00:38:35,317
But I've not come for work
but to trouble

416
00:38:35,318 --> 00:38:36,286
Trouble me

417
00:38:36,485 --> 00:38:38,653
Brother Kali you're
quite strong

418
00:38:38,654 --> 00:38:41,156
But wouldn't I hit once
if you hit me ten times

419
00:38:41,157 --> 00:38:44,062
You'll hit me, let me see
hit me

420
00:38:44,327 --> 00:38:46,661
Don't ask me like this
then I sure will

421
00:38:46,662 --> 00:38:48,496
You'll hit me
then do it

422
00:38:48,497 --> 00:38:50,466
Okay,come stand here

423
00:38:51,834 --> 00:38:55,499
I never take back what
I say & what I give

424
00:38:57,006 --> 00:39:00,471
My God!such a result for
one blow itself

425
00:39:00,676 --> 00:39:02,677
How dare you lay
your hands on me

426
00:39:02,678 --> 00:39:05,683
Madam is coming
madam is coming.....

427
00:39:06,515 --> 00:39:08,683
Where's madam
- just for fun

428
00:39:08,684 --> 00:39:11,186
Should you fight with him
don't we have other job

429
00:39:11,187 --> 00:39:12,472
Muthu,come here

430
00:39:12,855 --> 00:39:15,857
What I have in my brain you
have in your bone's

431
00:39:15,858 --> 00:39:19,694
It's all your blessings
- It's always with you

432
00:39:19,695 --> 00:39:22,697
Oh God!I've forgotton to
give coffee to master

433
00:39:22,698 --> 00:39:24,813
Coffee,I thought Cockroach

434
00:39:28,871 --> 00:39:29,871
Isn't there any Vehicle?

435
00:39:29,872 --> 00:39:33,673
Sister,there's a charriot
stop it,stopit...

436
00:39:33,876 --> 00:39:37,271
Oh my God,its them

437
00:39:37,880 --> 00:39:38,415
Master

438
00:39:38,547 --> 00:39:41,142
Stop the charriot
- okay master

439
00:39:41,384 --> 00:39:45,685
It's stopped can the charriot
move after seeing us?

440
00:39:51,394 --> 00:39:54,023
Greet him
- Greetings

441
00:40:02,071 --> 00:40:03,696
Do you remember me?

442
00:40:05,908 --> 00:40:09,853
Even in your last drama the
garland on my neck

443
00:40:10,246 --> 00:40:15,207
Yes... I was bit rude
that day

444
00:40:15,418 --> 00:40:16,843
Please forgive me

445
00:40:17,420 --> 00:40:19,421
Why are you standing
here?

446
00:40:19,422 --> 00:40:22,090
They don't have a better job
master

447
00:40:22,091 --> 00:40:23,425
They're enjoying breeze
come,we'll go

448
00:40:23,426 --> 00:40:26,726
No,to stage a drama
in Anganoor

449
00:40:27,263 --> 00:40:29,498
We were coming
in the Car

450
00:40:32,935 --> 00:40:39,899
You both came in a car
you both came in a car

451
00:40:41,110 --> 00:40:43,405
Don't lie,master
we'll go

452
00:40:47,116 --> 00:40:47,991
Look there

453
00:40:49,452 --> 00:40:52,581
This is real
this is dream

454
00:40:52,788 --> 00:40:58,250
Who can win over me
in this World

455
00:41:00,296 --> 00:41:03,631
Master gave money for petrol
to go for drama

456
00:41:03,632 --> 00:41:06,967
But he boosed and dashed
against a tree

457
00:41:07,803 --> 00:41:10,305
We don't know how to
go to Anganoor

458
00:41:10,306 --> 00:41:12,474
Also no Vehicle passes
by this way

459
00:41:12,475 --> 00:41:16,276
So if you can
drop us there

460
00:41:16,479 --> 00:41:18,524
Just dropping you there -

461
00:41:18,647 --> 00:41:22,782
I'll stay to see the drama
only then,I'll leave

462
00:41:26,822 --> 00:41:28,323
Shall we go,its getting
late for you

463
00:41:28,324 --> 00:41:28,990
Yes we shall

464
00:41:28,991 --> 00:41:32,291
Valayapathy useless guy
come quickly

465
00:41:32,828 --> 00:41:35,963
Carry this,Brother can you
carry this

466
00:41:36,499 --> 00:41:39,004
No need,I'll carry
it myself

467
00:41:40,503 --> 00:41:43,004
Everything is happening
up side down

468
00:41:43,005 --> 00:41:47,966
Didn't we come in the car
where's it?

469
00:41:51,180 --> 00:41:53,825
Who has tied horse
to the car?

470
00:42:00,356 --> 00:42:03,155
Who hit me?-I saw you

471
00:42:03,859 --> 00:42:06,328
Is it so powerfull

472
00:42:07,363 --> 00:42:10,008
Okay where's the make
up room?

473
00:42:10,199 --> 00:42:11,366
It's over there,Prince

474
00:42:11,367 --> 00:42:12,494
Where?-there

475
00:42:17,373 --> 00:42:19,948
Why they need this
for a car?

476
00:42:22,211 --> 00:42:26,006
Didn't I ask you where the
make up room is?

477
00:42:29,218 --> 00:42:32,347
How come you've got over
so quickly?

478
00:42:33,722 --> 00:42:37,127
Shouldn't there be a
stearing over here?

479
00:42:41,063 --> 00:42:43,731
Should we take them
with us,master?

480
00:42:43,732 --> 00:42:47,127
Won't you ride -when
did you come here?

481
00:42:58,914 --> 00:43:00,539
What's pricking me?

482
00:43:02,251 --> 00:43:05,710
Driver I've got
a doubt?

483
00:43:11,594 --> 00:43:12,061
What?

484
00:43:15,431 --> 00:43:17,265
Don't you know Tamil as if
like a English woman

485
00:43:17,266 --> 00:43:20,101
You look very Stylish so I
thought you knew English

486
00:43:20,102 --> 00:43:21,507
No,I don't know

487
00:43:21,770 --> 00:43:23,255
What's your name?

488
00:43:24,940 --> 00:43:28,125
I've never got
what I've desired for

489
00:43:28,277 --> 00:43:29,110
Will I get it?

490
00:43:29,111 --> 00:43:29,986
Your name?

491
00:43:31,113 --> 00:43:35,808
What you are destined to get
you'll get it & vice versa

492
00:43:38,621 --> 00:43:39,247
Master

493
00:43:40,289 --> 00:43:41,122
What Muthu?

494
00:43:41,123 --> 00:43:43,291
I can't ride if she sits here
ask her to change place

495
00:43:43,292 --> 00:43:47,177
Sister won't you behave youself
come this side

496
00:43:49,798 --> 00:43:52,427
Driver,I've got
a doubt?

497
00:43:53,802 --> 00:43:56,377
Careful let it not
fall on me

498
00:43:56,972 --> 00:43:59,427
Look here,maintain
a distance

499
00:44:00,809 --> 00:44:02,904
As if you're
mr.Handsom

500
00:44:03,145 --> 00:44:04,979
As if you're Miss Beautiful
look at your face

501
00:44:04,980 --> 00:44:06,814
Muthu,what's wrong
with her face?

502
00:44:06,815 --> 00:44:09,785
Men are longing
for her sight

503
00:44:16,825 --> 00:44:19,494
Madam,let me do
my work properly

504
00:44:19,495 --> 00:44:21,162
Why do you trouble me?

505
00:44:21,163 --> 00:44:22,497
You'll only suffer later

506
00:44:22,498 --> 00:44:24,165
You can't be on time
for the drama

507
00:44:24,166 --> 00:44:27,168
Yes Rang,its late for Rehersal
don't argue

508
00:44:27,169 --> 00:44:28,836
Oh God!I didn't do
anything

509
00:44:28,837 --> 00:44:31,072
Let me not argue
with him

510
00:44:32,341 --> 00:44:34,026
Sir,can I sit here?

511
00:44:39,181 --> 00:44:40,848
Valayapathy,what
happened?

512
00:44:40,849 --> 00:44:42,850
I can't tell you this
keep quite

513
00:44:42,851 --> 00:44:44,686
Let my problem be
with me

514
00:44:44,687 --> 00:44:46,854
Driver move aside and sit
- why?

515
00:44:46,855 --> 00:44:48,523
Aren't ladies sitting
over there

516
00:44:48,524 --> 00:44:49,524
What?ladies over there

517
00:44:49,525 --> 00:44:51,025
Horses won't do anything
Isn't it?

518
00:44:51,026 --> 00:44:52,451
What with horses?

519
00:44:53,529 --> 00:44:55,530
What are you going
to do?

520
00:44:55,531 --> 00:44:57,532
What am I going to do?
you can control your anger,but...

521
00:44:57,533 --> 00:45:01,994
Can you control Uri..
- Hey!..gone!...gone...Yuck!

522
00:45:02,771 --> 00:45:05,306
Nuisance-This is also
poking me

523
00:45:05,307 --> 00:45:08,409
Driver am I not asking you a
doubt since a long time

524
00:45:08,410 --> 00:45:10,044
Did you ever try
to clear it?

525
00:45:10,045 --> 00:45:14,520
Come an ask?..why do we need
a lynch pin for a car?

526
00:45:31,567 --> 00:45:34,802
Yes master!-Take them to
the river-why master?

527
00:45:34,803 --> 00:45:35,270
Okay!

528
00:45:36,705 --> 00:45:38,539
Come quickly or else
I'll start

529
00:45:38,540 --> 00:45:40,241
Didn't I say not to
give them a lift

530
00:45:40,242 --> 00:45:42,710
It's freezing cold even to
dip my finger into it!

531
00:45:42,711 --> 00:45:44,846
What will happen to me if my
whole body gets into this water?

532
00:45:44,847 --> 00:45:49,682
I'll freeze to death!so I've take
bath outside carefully!

533
00:45:53,622 --> 00:45:56,497
What Hero?... playing
water games?!

534
00:46:07,770 --> 00:46:11,901
Though there are gores
of fair men around

535
00:46:12,207 --> 00:46:17,178
I who was never inclined to
Marry... the moment I saw you...

536
00:46:17,179 --> 00:46:20,174
...I had decided to
Marry only you!

537
00:46:21,016 --> 00:46:24,411
You don't have any objections
isn't it?

538
00:46:27,156 --> 00:46:30,792
After the drama,if you come
alone to my house...

539
00:46:30,793 --> 00:46:33,194
I'll take it as your
acceptance

540
00:46:33,195 --> 00:46:37,610
I'll tell my Mother at a proper
time and Marry you!

541
00:46:39,234 --> 00:46:44,138
Okay Muthu in coming,he doesn't like
Drama & Artists!keep it a secret!

542
00:46:44,139 --> 00:46:48,309
Every word you had uttered was
like honey to my ears

543
00:46:48,310 --> 00:46:53,476
At this young age,such
Love talk,unseen Love!...

544
00:46:53,749 --> 00:46:58,319
This man who made me hear it
& see it and blossmed Love in me!

545
00:46:58,320 --> 00:46:59,535
...Was by him!

546
00:47:02,090 --> 00:47:05,925
Ranjithan,my friend...Hey
I'm calling you

547
00:47:19,474 --> 00:47:24,178
When I approached you like a
waiting crane approaching a fish!

548
00:47:24,179 --> 00:47:26,848
But,you're talking about
some coward!

549
00:47:26,849 --> 00:47:28,850
Have you forgoton,that
I am a cheat?

550
00:47:28,851 --> 00:47:31,185
And have you forgotton to notice
the 2 Rowdies behind me?

551
00:47:31,186 --> 00:47:34,251
King,why are you calling
as Rowdies?

552
00:47:34,690 --> 00:47:38,926
You're just head of this Troupe
I am cheif of this town!

553
00:47:38,927 --> 00:47:42,864
After borrowing money from me,you
may have forgotton your words

554
00:47:42,865 --> 00:47:46,996
But I haven't forgotton
what you've said

555
00:47:47,536 --> 00:47:48,891
Stop your speach

556
00:47:48,904 --> 00:47:52,607
Or I shall stop your breath
with a sword!am I right?

557
00:47:52,608 --> 00:47:53,507
Whatever you say
you're right!

558
00:47:53,508 --> 00:47:57,545
Right now the rehersal is going on
I'll send immediately after that!

559
00:47:57,546 --> 00:47:58,546
...Sir,please go for me

560
00:47:58,547 --> 00:48:02,216
Now,you'll say,after rehersal after
that,you'll say after Drama...

561
00:48:02,217 --> 00:48:04,552
Finally you'll
say she's gone

562
00:48:04,553 --> 00:48:06,120
Do you think this
will be good to us?

563
00:48:06,121 --> 00:48:08,055
Order me king
order me...!

564
00:48:08,056 --> 00:48:10,224
My bravery will get
rewarded!

565
00:48:10,225 --> 00:48:12,326
No way-how can you
say that?

566
00:48:12,327 --> 00:48:14,929
You'll get what's destined to you!
you won't get what isn't destined to you!

567
00:48:14,930 --> 00:48:18,232
Dialogue is quite good,our Director
wouldn't write so nicely?

568
00:48:18,233 --> 00:48:20,618
Muthu said this
while coming

569
00:48:20,669 --> 00:48:24,405
Abduct the girl and come
to my forest Bunglow

570
00:48:24,406 --> 00:48:26,241
You ride the carriage?

571
00:48:26,909 --> 00:48:28,609
Sir,why so many for this?

572
00:48:28,610 --> 00:48:34,175
I've never lost before I've to be
here who ever may go away,bye!

573
00:48:34,583 --> 00:48:35,549
Who's there?

574
00:48:35,550 --> 00:48:39,220
Immediately abduct this princess
to my palace!

575
00:48:39,221 --> 00:48:42,590
How can you come in without
proper costumes?

576
00:48:42,591 --> 00:48:43,396
Get lost!

577
00:48:51,233 --> 00:48:53,338
Why are you hitting them?

578
00:48:53,468 --> 00:48:55,269
I think they're really
hitting them

579
00:48:55,270 --> 00:48:58,773
Yes Master,this is the most
interesting scene of this Drama!

580
00:48:58,774 --> 00:48:59,579
Leave me!

581
00:49:00,008 --> 00:49:01,475
Look,how naturally
she's acting!

582
00:49:01,476 --> 00:49:03,110
Sir,no they're hitting us
really!please save us!

583
00:49:03,111 --> 00:49:05,966
Hit him he thinks
he's Kamalhasan

584
00:49:14,456 --> 00:49:16,590
They are beating up even
the Director,some thing's fishy!

585
00:49:16,591 --> 00:49:17,858
They are taking away
Ranga Nayagi

586
00:49:17,859 --> 00:49:20,061
Let them leave
it Master!...

587
00:49:20,062 --> 00:49:23,007
Muthu save Ranganayagi
- yes master!

588
00:49:26,468 --> 00:49:30,667
Hey!I'll tear and cut
you into pieces!

589
00:49:33,909 --> 00:49:37,294
Just for fun,don't take
it to be real!

590
00:49:37,546 --> 00:49:40,915
Brother,poor girl,they're eking their
livlihood by staging plays!

591
00:49:40,916 --> 00:49:43,985
..Why do you trouble them?
go peacefully from here

592
00:49:43,986 --> 00:49:45,951
Master I've saved them!

593
00:49:46,588 --> 00:49:47,655
What's it brother?

594
00:49:47,656 --> 00:49:49,490
Who did you save
this girl?

595
00:49:49,491 --> 00:49:51,586
Save her,let me see that

596
00:49:52,194 --> 00:49:54,395
What's this brother?I've come to talk
peace & you're hitting me!

597
00:49:54,396 --> 00:49:55,351
...What?....

598
00:50:09,678 --> 00:50:12,648
What do you think
of yourself?

599
00:50:13,015 --> 00:50:14,382
How dare you call me
like that?

600
00:50:14,383 --> 00:50:15,388
When did I?

601
00:50:15,817 --> 00:50:16,917
While you were
sitting here

602
00:50:16,918 --> 00:50:20,354
Something happened to me when
I sat here,so I blabbered

603
00:50:20,355 --> 00:50:22,051
How can that happen?

604
00:50:22,357 --> 00:50:25,693
Brother,wouldn't I hit once
if you hit me ten times

605
00:50:25,694 --> 00:50:27,695
Will you hit me?
come..let me see

606
00:50:27,696 --> 00:50:29,824
I'll-let me see!?....

607
00:50:30,532 --> 00:50:32,157
Okay come this side

608
00:50:32,167 --> 00:50:37,072
Neither I take back my words!
nor the charity given by me!

609
00:50:38,206 --> 00:50:38,741
Master

610
00:50:49,885 --> 00:50:50,830
Leave me...

611
00:51:30,258 --> 00:51:34,261
He'll pay all our dues isn't it
- how can he get away?

612
00:51:34,262 --> 00:51:35,207
Leave me...

613
00:52:07,295 --> 00:52:08,250
...You?!....

614
00:52:39,528 --> 00:52:42,293
Master...master...!

615
00:52:42,898 --> 00:52:45,499
Muthu,this is their area
their men are coming...

616
00:52:45,500 --> 00:52:47,001
Take Ranganayagi away
from here

617
00:52:47,002 --> 00:52:48,502
Let anyone come..
we'll manage!

618
00:52:48,503 --> 00:52:50,905
No one's hand should
touch Ranganayagi

619
00:52:50,906 --> 00:52:52,439
First take her away

620
00:52:52,440 --> 00:52:53,841
Then,what about you
- I'll look after myself

621
00:52:53,842 --> 00:52:56,507
Master-keep going
- alright sir!

622
00:53:11,626 --> 00:53:12,971
Don't fuss much

623
00:54:58,133 --> 00:55:05,768
Where did he go?....diappeared?!

645
01:00:10,778 --> 01:00:11,746
Who knows?

646
01:00:12,447 --> 01:00:14,881
I've never bothered
the way I go

647
01:00:14,882 --> 01:00:18,751
I trust God and go in the
route he takes me

648
01:00:19,954 --> 01:00:22,122

01:00:59,761 --> 01:01:01,561
I feel he's asking for the
God's offerings!

655
01:01:01,562 --> 01:01:03,457
Okay,we shall give him

658
01:01:10,838 --> 01:01:11,713
Hey!-what?

659
01:01:11,939 --> 01:01:13,173
Feeling very hungry!

660
01:01:13,174 --> 01:01:15,609
Lot's of green leaves & grass is
there!pluck & eat!

661
01:01:15,610 --> 01:01:20,025
Did I ask for the horse?I said

662
01:01:20,848 --> 01:01:22,873
look,there's a tea shop

663
01:01:26,354 --> 01:01:30,155
Sister,who's that girl?

664
01:01:30,358 --> 01:01:35,429
Why,do I need to ask you anymore?
I'll go & eat,go my Emperess go!

665
01:01:35,430 --> 01:01:37,731
Eat without money and
get bashed up!

666
01:01:37,732 --> 01:01:38,495
I know

667
01:01:39,133 --> 01:01:43,136
This is Queen of Travancore
last year,I had seen her!

668
01:01:43,137 --> 01:01:46,940
It's a blessing that she is
coming to our shop!...come!...

669
01:01:46,941 --> 01:01:48,442
Slowly it might sprain

670
01:01:48,443 --> 01:01:51,858
Whom are you taking about
- about myself!

671

Most welcome Queen!

672
01:01:56,884 --> 01:02:02,609
It's my great fortune that Queen of
Travancore has come to our shop!

673
01:02:02,890 --> 01:02:04,518

He's a servant in my Palace

676
01:02:09,731 --> 01:02:10,736
He's hungry

677
01:02:10,898 --> 01:02:12,643
That's why,I'm here

678
01:02:13,401 --> 01:02:15,235
How come she's speaking
this language?

679
01:02:15,236 --> 01:02:16,903
She roams places
isn't it?

680
01:02:16,904 --> 01:02:20,389
Servant move aside

Oh!tea

684
01:03:06,788 --> 01:03:10,183
You look like a king not
like a servant

685
01:03:11,459 --> 01:03:13,928
You like a king...

686
01:03:36,484 --> 01:03:37,818
Ask for money ask

687
01:03:37,819 --> 01:03:38,286

691

Sister,look here gold

01:03:57,505 --> 01:04:01,636

698
01:04:26,701 --> 01:04:28,586
I don't talk to Queen

Oh!This is Kuluwalee

711
01:05:08,409 --> 01:05:10,878
Your place is Kuluwalee

712
01:05:12,747 --> 01:05:15,376
My place is Kalipatti

713
01:05:15,917 --> 01:05:16,917

How dare you
call me dog?

718
01:05:39,774 --> 01:05:45,577
Yuck,God,what nuisance

For a kiss/-That means?

723
01:06:04,632 --> 01:06:09,263
It means,to ask for route
in this language.

724
01:06:09,971 --> 01:06:12,556
Then how to ask
for Kalipatti?

01:06:13,140 --> 01:06:15,268
Hug tight and kiss me.

726
01:06:18,145 --> 01:06:19,813
But Kalipatti isn't there.

727
01:06:19,814 --> 01:06:21,859

01:06:27,822 --> 01:06:29,447

01:08:35,116 --> 01:08:36,116
What he asked her?

758

Brother,please
forgive him

01:09:42,516 --> 01:09:45,685
Sir wishes of a Tamilian
- Oh!You're a tamilian

784
01:09:45,686 --> 01:09:47,854
How are you
what do you want?

785
01:09:47,855 --> 01:09:50,523
You must tell me meaning of what
I ask-Okay ask me

786
01:09:50,524 --> 01:09:53,849
You musn't scold,spit
or hit me later.

787
01:09:54,195 --> 01:09:55,960
Sure
- Comeon,ask me

788
01:09:56,697 --> 01:09:58,522
Hug tight and kiss me

789
01:10:00,534 --> 01:10:03,109
See to your work
go from here

790
01:10:05,039 --> 01:10:06,206
What did you ask me?

791
01:10:06,207 --> 01:10:08,041
You won't harm me right
- Yes!

792
01:10:08,042 --> 01:10:10,067
I'm afraid
- don't be.

793
01:10:10,711 --> 01:10:12,536
Hug tight and kiss me

794
01:10:16,550 --> 01:10:18,718
Yuck,What kind of a man are you
to kiss another man.

795
01:10:18,719 --> 01:10:20,386
You only had asked me to hug
you tight and kiss you!

796
01:10:20,387 --> 01:10:21,221
When did I ask you?

797
01:10:21,222 --> 01:10:24,147
What you had asked
meant only this

798
01:10:24,225 --> 01:10:26,226
I kissed your checks because
you're a man

799
01:10:26,227 --> 01:10:29,896
If it was a woman I would
have kissed her lips

800
01:10:29,897 --> 01:10:32,696
I am man,Isn't it
- No doubt

801
01:13:03,050 --> 01:13:04,875
You said that for fun

802
01:13:05,386 --> 01:13:08,054
I would have left it likewise
But.....

803
01:13:08,055 --> 01:13:12,857
But that Mudaliar irritated me
so out of anger

804
01:13:30,077 --> 01:13:40,044
A bud has blossomed
in Kuluwalee

805
01:13:42,923 --> 01:13:52,922
<i>Y DD</i>

806
01:13:56,270 --> 01:14:03,734
A bud has blossomed in Kuluwalee
due to the knoking of the bee

807
01:14:04,111 --> 01:14:14,110
It's time to suck honey
the angel is feeling shy

808
01:14:15,956 --> 01:14:23,591
Muthu's kiss has created
Cyclone inside a flower

809
01:14:25,499 --> 01:14:35,498
<i>Y DD</i>

810
01:15:42,376 --> 01:15:50,182
Ranganayagi,you've taken away
brother-in-law's heart

811
01:15:50,551 --> 01:15:57,856
You've disturbed my heart just
the way you disturb your hair

812
01:15:58,392 --> 01:16:04,354
Am I so attractive
don't lie

813
01:16:07,100 --> 01:16:17,099
<i>Y DD</i>

814
01:17:26,813 --> 01:17:34,448
What party is our party?

815
01:17:34,655 --> 01:17:40,788
What party is ours
ours is the love party

816
01:17:41,662 --> 01:17:50,298
Why we need a party now?
Let time answer that.

817
01:17:50,671 --> 01:17:56,633
You have some plan but
let the time favour you

818
01:17:57,711 --> 01:18:07,710
<i>Y DD</i>

819
01:19:04,411 --> 01:19:05,411
What happened?

820
01:19:05,412 --> 01:19:07,079
My master will be
waiting for me

821
01:19:07,080 --> 01:19:09,749
Tell me where your troupe is
I'll drop you there

822
01:19:09,750 --> 01:19:11,083
I don't know where
they are

823
01:19:11,084 --> 01:19:13,085
But I'm not going
back there

824
01:19:13,086 --> 01:19:13,712
Why?

825
01:19:14,087 --> 01:19:17,256
Because my,drama's boss intends to
sell me anytime

826
01:19:17,257 --> 01:19:21,882
Yes,tell me where your parents
are?I'll drop you there

827
01:19:23,263 --> 01:19:26,248
What do you say-
Both aren't alive

828
01:19:29,436 --> 01:19:31,871
I'm also an orphan
like you

829
01:19:32,272 --> 01:19:34,440
I was brought up
by my sister

830
01:19:34,441 --> 01:19:37,846
She's a wonderful woman
but my uncle....

831
01:19:44,117 --> 01:19:44,950
Sister.....

832
01:19:44,951 --> 01:19:46,706
I'll tear you apart!

833
01:19:48,555 --> 01:19:51,157
My sister,used to suffer like
this everyday!!

834
01:19:51,158 --> 01:19:54,960
Brute!When I am out,will you
bring other women to home?

835
01:19:54,961 --> 01:19:56,529
What's wrong in doing that?

836
01:19:56,530 --> 01:19:59,465
Leave...Leave..
- Will you beat me?

837
01:20:03,870 --> 01:20:05,225
Watch out there!

838
01:20:06,640 --> 01:20:07,715
Is she dead?

839
01:20:10,310 --> 01:20:12,040
Dead?!.....Get lost!

840
01:20:16,383 --> 01:20:22,298
Hey!Why do you look at me like that
Is it because your sister's dead?

841
01:20:23,990 --> 01:20:24,490
Hey!Why are you standing
still?

842
01:20:24,491 --> 01:20:27,193
Let her die!Why do you
feel sorry for that?

843
01:20:27,194 --> 01:20:28,819
What's the problem?

844
01:20:31,665 --> 01:20:33,632
Hey!Where are you going?

845
01:20:33,633 --> 01:20:35,868
Hey!Why are you escaping after
killing your sister?

846
01:20:35,869 --> 01:20:38,805
Hey!You...stop...Hey!...

847
01:20:39,906 --> 01:20:42,708
..I am away from there to
join this Drama troupe.

848
01:20:42,709 --> 01:20:47,513
Getting saved of my brother-in-law,I am
living a life of wearing disguises!

849
01:20:47,514 --> 01:20:52,184
Don't worry,Ranganayaki!God is there
He'll never let down good people!

850
01:20:52,185 --> 01:20:55,354
We shall do one thng
my master is a nice man

851
01:20:55,355 --> 01:20:57,356
He can help you get a job

852
01:20:57,357 --> 01:20:59,322
You stay with me there!

853
01:21:01,094 --> 01:21:02,661
But on one condition
- What's that?

854
01:21:02,662 --> 01:21:07,700
Till my master gets married,No one
should know what's between us

855
01:21:07,701 --> 01:21:08,834
What's there betweeen me?

856
01:21:08,835 --> 01:21:10,402
Isn't there anything
between us?

857
01:21:10,403 --> 01:21:11,737
What could be there?

858
01:21:11,738 --> 01:21:13,172
That's why,I always say girls
should never be trusted!

859
01:21:13,173 --> 01:21:15,039
But,I trust only you

860
01:21:16,276 --> 01:21:17,343
What happened?

861
01:21:17,344 --> 01:21:19,211
Some strange feeling is
tingling inside me!

862
01:21:19,212 --> 01:21:25,675
My sweet Robber
Sweet kisses!

863
01:21:28,054 --> 01:21:29,899
Nothing,Nothing...Boys!

864
01:21:33,627 --> 01:21:37,642
After the drama If you come
to my house alone..

865
01:21:38,331 --> 01:21:41,046
I'll take it as your
acceptance

866
01:22:03,023 --> 01:22:05,057
Muthu,You are safe
isn't it?

867
01:22:05,058 --> 01:22:06,358
Is everyone safe?
- Yes master

868
01:22:06,359 --> 01:22:08,027
What happened,you went yesterday
but you are coming only today?

869
01:22:08,028 --> 01:22:09,428
It's a big story,Master

870
01:22:09,429 --> 01:22:11,196
We lost our way and went
into other state!

871
01:22:11,197 --> 01:22:14,433
Like a stranger lost and
got beaten by few people also!

872
01:22:14,434 --> 01:22:16,769
I had never faced such a
situation in my entire life!

873
01:22:16,770 --> 01:22:19,501
Has the carriage come empty?

874
01:22:45,999 --> 01:22:46,465
Greetings!

875
01:22:46,466 --> 01:22:46,799
This Lady as a Heroine?!?!!

876
01:22:46,800 --> 01:22:48,367
What's this nuisance
master?

877
01:22:48,368 --> 01:22:50,235
Not only just saving her!It seems
we've to give her shelter also!

878
01:22:50,236 --> 01:22:51,804
Because,She doesn't have any
other place to go,So she says..

879
01:22:51,805 --> 01:22:53,806
She says the troupe is else where
and no place to go!

880
01:22:53,807 --> 01:22:54,707
..And asked me to take
her to my home!

881
01:22:54,708 --> 01:22:55,975
I said a big'No'to her!

882
01:22:55,976 --> 01:22:58,811
She insisted an taking her to you
So I've done that!

883
01:22:58,812 --> 01:22:59,827
Clever girl!

884
01:23:00,313 --> 01:23:00,848
Master

885
01:23:01,147 --> 01:23:04,016
There are many workers here! Let her
also stay here as one among them!

886
01:23:04,017 --> 01:23:07,653
That's your wish,Master
I am not concerned with it!

887
01:23:07,654 --> 01:23:10,649
You go inside
- Yes,go inside...go!

888
01:23:25,238 --> 01:23:28,633
Everything's is a drama
life is a drama

889
01:23:41,521 --> 01:23:44,423
..No...No...Not that one...
take that one!

890
01:23:44,424 --> 01:23:45,524
Keep it,there.

891
01:23:45,525 --> 01:23:47,526
Not there,here
Please,place it here

892
01:23:47,527 --> 01:23:49,702
Not here...place it there!

893
01:23:50,030 --> 01:23:52,664
Oh!God!Madam,decide and
tell one proper place!

894
01:23:52,665 --> 01:23:54,867
I'm going to be the Lady
of this house

895
01:23:54,868 --> 01:23:56,468
If you don't work properly
I'll dismiss you

896
01:23:56,469 --> 01:23:58,370
Where should I keep it?
- over there

897
01:23:58,371 --> 01:24:01,296
Lady of the house
is always right!

898
01:24:07,781 --> 01:24:09,048
Who are you all?

899
01:24:09,049 --> 01:24:09,584
Sister

900
01:24:13,720 --> 01:24:15,425
What happened sister?

901
01:24:15,555 --> 01:24:19,185
Without you we couldn't stage
the drama

902
01:24:21,528 --> 01:24:25,363
The lazy owner has
sent us away

903
01:24:27,067 --> 01:24:32,671
Stop,What's this funeral elegy?They're
singing funeral elegy,Ask them!

904
01:24:32,672 --> 01:24:33,806
I'll punch your face

905
01:24:33,807 --> 01:24:36,732
Are you staging a drama here
- No?

906
01:24:39,045 --> 01:24:42,581
We could'nt stage dramas
without RangaNayagi!

907
01:24:42,582 --> 01:24:45,987
But,Still we tried this
Lady as Heroine!

908
01:24:47,420 --> 01:24:48,587
They would've thrown bricks
at her,isn't it?

909
01:24:48,588 --> 01:24:52,191
Yes,a lot,so much that I
could build even a house!

910
01:24:52,192 --> 01:24:54,259
..They chased by showing us
with so many bricks!

911
01:24:54,260 --> 01:24:59,305
Finding no other way,We've come
to take Ranganayaki with us!

912
01:25:00,333 --> 01:25:02,968
Lots of people are depending
on you for their livlihood1

913
01:25:02,969 --> 01:25:07,744
If you give them some work
They'll survive....Poor souls!

914
01:25:07,841 --> 01:25:11,801
Don't you know that I like
dramas and artists.

915
01:25:13,613 --> 01:25:17,708
Assign them job and arrange
place for their stay!

916
01:25:17,784 --> 01:25:19,485
What Role were you playing
in the plays?

917
01:25:19,486 --> 01:25:20,986
...I was the commander!

918
01:25:20,987 --> 01:25:23,122
Clean the chairs
over here.

919
01:25:23,123 --> 01:25:25,290
What was your role?
- I was the spy!

920
01:25:25,291 --> 01:25:27,259
You'll remove all
the cobwebs.

921
01:25:27,260 --> 01:25:29,295
What was your role?
- I used to sing playback!

922
01:25:29,295 --> 01:25:30,796
You sweep the backyard.

923
01:25:30,797 --> 01:25:32,698
What you do?
- Flattering!

924
01:25:32,699 --> 01:25:33,832
Then be with me

925
01:25:33,833 --> 01:25:37,102
And you?-Drums!
- then work on the first floor!

926
01:25:37,103 --> 01:25:41,700
And you?-I'm a stand by heroine
You water the plants!

927
01:25:42,475 --> 01:25:44,743
You'll draw water from
this well!

928
01:25:44,744 --> 01:25:46,745
At the palace?
- No at the backyard

929
01:25:46,746 --> 01:25:48,101
Will Muthu come?

930
01:25:49,883 --> 01:25:52,388
I'll take care
of you later!

931
01:25:54,354 --> 01:25:57,356
Why are you giving poses?
what role were you playing?

932
01:25:57,357 --> 01:25:58,824
Royal Roles
- what does it mean?

933
01:25:58,825 --> 01:26:02,995
Can't you understand?I'll play king...
when I was riding this Horse!

934
01:26:02,996 --> 01:26:04,997
Stop it.Do you come
on a horse?

935
01:26:04,998 --> 01:26:08,100
From today you'll clear
all this Horses Dung!

936
01:26:08,101 --> 01:26:09,046
Dung?!-Yes!

937

Impossible!If I do that I'll
lose my honour!

938
01:26:12,906 --> 01:26:13,939
Look out for some other!

939
01:26:13,940 --> 01:26:15,841
If you don't listen to me
You'll lose your livlihood!

of my Dream

944
01:26:46,739 --> 01:26:48,230
Prince...my foot

945
01:26:48,708 --> 01:26:51,283
How do you call
him a Prince?

946
01:26:52,212 --> 01:26:54,117
The same thin structure

947
01:26:55,248 --> 01:26:56,533
The similar dot

948
01:26:57,383 --> 01:26:59,181
Similar Beautiful hair

949
01:27:00,386 --> 01:27:03,356
I'll cut all their
hair tonight

950
01:27:03,556 --> 01:27:07,857
Tie the Cow to the cart

951
01:27:08,394 --> 01:27:12,525
Taking hold for agri

952
01:27:12,899 --> 01:27:18,031
Plow the land Chellakanu

953
01:27:40,260 --> 01:27:43,230
"MY DEAREST -THIEF"

954
01:27:46,266 --> 01:27:48,301
Muthu what are you doing

955
01:27:49,269 --> 01:27:52,569

956
01:28:08,621 --> 01:28:10,214
Idiot,Idiot,Idiot

957
01:28:10,623 --> 01:28:12,518
What did I do Idiotic?

958
01:28:12,625 --> 01:28:15,627
I just informed that Landlord
likes the servant maid,for that

959
01:28:15,628 --> 01:28:16,962
I didn't mean you

960
01:28:16,963 --> 01:28:18,248
I blamed myself

961
01:28:18,631 --> 01:28:20,966
The moment he accepted to
Marry my daughter

962
01:28:20,967 --> 01:28:23,302
I should have performed
their marriage

963
01:28:23,303 --> 01:28:26,638
If so I would have accquired
Wealth equal to this

964
01:28:26,639 --> 01:28:27,984
I've delayed it

965
01:28:29,475 --> 01:28:32,811
Should raise the bridge
before Flood comes

966
01:28:32,812 --> 01:28:34,146
Who's that servant maid?

967
01:28:34,147 --> 01:28:35,647
Her name is Ranganayagi

968
01:28:35,648 --> 01:28:37,683
She was acting in Dramas

969
01:28:39,652 --> 01:28:40,257
Beloved

970
01:28:42,488 --> 01:28:44,113
Why are you Crying?

971
01:28:46,326 --> 01:28:47,993

the nights

973
01:28:51,164 --> 01:28:52,331
Don't worry beloved

974
01:28:52,332 --> 01:28:54,499
Even if it's dead,a Lion
is a Lion

975
01:28:54,500 --> 01:28:57,002
Even if you have lost your hair

978
01:29:00,673 --> 01:29:04,974
Ha...ha...ha...
I'm flying high hearing this

979
01:29:05,511 --> 01:29:06,996
I'm really flying

980
01:29:07,013 --> 01:29:09,181
I can't see the
World clearly

981
01:29:09,182 --> 01:29:10,849
You can see clearly
you dog

982
01:29:10,850 --> 01:29:13,319
Are you trying to tap her?

983
01:29:13,853 --> 01:29:14,853
Come with me... Come

984
01:29:14,854 --> 01:29:15,659
Where to?

985
01:29:15,688 --> 01:29:17,993
To throw you into
the Well

986
01:29:54,227 --> 01:29:55,227
Who are you?

987
01:29:55,228 --> 01:29:57,623
Walking in without
permission

988
01:29:58,564 --> 01:29:59,159
Go out

989
01:29:59,232 --> 01:30:00,777
Don't you hear us

990
01:30:09,742 --> 01:30:12,997
He's not listening to us
- Who is he?

991
01:30:17,517 --> 01:30:20,432
Old man stop,am I
not telling you

992
01:30:25,925 --> 01:30:27,340
Who's that,stop!

993
01:30:29,262 --> 01:30:31,017
Am I not telling you

994
01:30:47,113 --> 01:30:49,742
Doesn't he look
like a sage

995
01:31:00,126 --> 01:31:04,401
He looks like a mad man,you're
calling him a sage

996
01:31:06,365 --> 01:31:08,400
Elderly man.Who are you?

997
01:31:10,036 --> 01:31:12,471
I'm trying to
find only that

998
01:31:12,472 --> 01:31:14,027
I don't understand

999
01:31:14,140 --> 01:31:17,309
I'm a puzzle for those who
don't know me

1000
01:31:17,310 --> 01:31:19,244
A Cyclone for those
who know me

1001
01:31:19,245 --> 01:31:20,800
Who knows you well

1002
01:31:21,481 --> 01:31:23,148
The Madam of this house

1003
01:31:23,149 --> 01:31:24,904
Madam is not at home

1004
01:31:25,485 --> 01:31:26,318
Where is she?

1005
01:31:26,319 --> 01:31:27,486
She has gone to the Temple

1006
01:31:27,487 --> 01:31:28,292
What for?

1007
01:31:29,822 --> 01:31:32,127
Why do people go to Temple?

1008
01:31:32,158 --> 01:31:33,373
To Worship God

1009
01:31:35,561 --> 01:31:36,836
Then who's he?

1010
01:31:43,169 --> 01:31:46,784
God is inside,they're
searching him outside

1011
01:31:49,342 --> 01:31:52,127
Why is everyone idle
go and work

1012
01:31:52,845 --> 01:31:55,514
If we are not here
everybody turns idle

1013
01:31:55,515 --> 01:31:59,240
That's why I'm bit strict

Some are mad after Women

1017
01:32:15,201 --> 01:32:17,446
Some are mad after position

1018
01:32:17,703 --> 01:32:20,968
You're mad after your
Uncle's daughter

1019
01:32:22,875 --> 01:32:26,740

you while speaking

1097
01:44:22,594 --> 01:44:31,731
I'm innocent and I dwell in
the heart of masses

1098
01:44:31,937 --> 01:44:36,068
I'm for you,take
me completely

1099
01:44:36,275 --> 01:44:40,736
Accept,learn,play even if
I'm over you

1100
01:44:40,946 --> 01:44:45,247
Should cover my face
in your chest

1101
01:44:45,450 --> 01:44:49,751
Our relation should stand
the test of time

1102
01:44:49,955 --> 01:44:54,416
Should be together without
any hindrence

1103
01:44:56,295 --> 01:45:06,294
<i>Y DD</i>

1104
01:46:16,041 --> 01:46:20,342
Why have you loved a
dark man like me?

1105
01:46:20,712 --> 01:46:25,013
Even the colour of the
Sky & ocean are dark

1106
01:46:25,217 --> 01:46:29,720
I'm remembered of you when I see
the sky and the ocean

1107
01:46:29,721 --> 01:46:34,022
Because of you,without henna
I'm turning red.

1108
01:46:38,897 --> 01:46:43,122
Your eyes are mesmerizing
I've fallen in your trap

1109
01:46:43,235 --> 01:46:47,536
I'm trapped because of
your love!!

1110
01:46:47,739 --> 01:46:52,200
I'm a wild bull which
is calm because of you

1111
01:46:56,915 --> 01:47:06,914
<i>Y DD</i>

1112
01:48:29,508 --> 01:48:30,806
He has got up

1113
01:48:31,843 --> 01:48:33,812
Oh!sage bless us!

1114
01:48:45,857 --> 01:48:47,692
Great regards!God man!

1115
01:48:48,527 --> 01:48:50,832
Do you remember me?God man!

1116
01:48:51,029 --> 01:48:53,531
15 years before I got your
blessings in Kasi

1117
01:48:53,532 --> 01:48:55,699
After that I've become
very Wealthy

1118
01:48:55,700 --> 01:48:57,201
I heard,that you're here

1119
01:48:57,202 --> 01:48:58,869
Hence I came to see you

1120
01:48:58,870 --> 01:49:00,565
This is my offerings

1121
01:49:01,206 --> 01:49:02,351
What is this?

1122
01:49:08,713 --> 01:49:11,382
What will this sage
do with this?

1123
01:49:11,383 --> 01:49:13,551
Having known every thing
why do you tell like this?sage!

1124
01:49:13,552 --> 01:49:15,886
We can't live in this
World without money

1125
01:49:15,887 --> 01:49:17,721
We can buy anything with this

1126
01:49:17,722 --> 01:49:19,223
What do you want now?

1127
01:49:19,224 --> 01:49:21,725
With your blessings
I'm quite well off

1128
01:49:21,726 --> 01:49:24,431
But I don't have
peace in life

1129
01:49:34,239 --> 01:49:37,574
You said we can buy
anything with money

1130
01:49:37,742 --> 01:49:39,497
Can't you buy peace?

1131
01:49:41,746 --> 01:49:46,171
By keeping all people's money
how can you get peace?

1132
01:49:46,418 --> 01:49:52,143
Keep less you need,rest give to
other's then only peace comes freely

1133
01:49:53,925 --> 01:49:57,800
These who stock money
don't have peace at all

1134
01:49:57,929 --> 01:50:01,064
One who stores good deeds
gets peace!

1135
01:50:03,268 --> 01:50:06,413
We never brought anything
while coming

1136
01:50:06,771 --> 01:50:08,439
We'll never take back
anything while going

1137
01:50:08,440 --> 01:50:11,775
Why in the middle do we
long for Wealth

1138
01:50:11,776 --> 01:50:12,776
Go... Get Lost....

1139
01:50:12,777 --> 01:50:16,922
Take this and give it to the
needy people and go

1140
01:50:25,790 --> 01:50:27,275
What do you want?

1141
01:50:27,292 --> 01:50:29,059
We came to see you God

1142
01:50:29,060 --> 01:50:29,525
God?!

1143
01:50:35,734 --> 01:50:37,829
You've seen right,now go

1144
01:50:38,837 --> 01:50:40,904
Go and look after your work
...Work is God!

1145
01:50:40,905 --> 01:50:44,899
Let's go or he'll be angry
Brother move aside

1146
01:51:04,562 --> 01:51:05,307
Greetings

1147
01:51:05,930 --> 01:51:06,930
What do you want?

1148
01:51:06,931 --> 01:51:09,730
I'm in Love with a girl

1149
01:51:10,001 --> 01:51:12,334
I want to Marry her

1150
01:51:13,004 --> 01:51:13,937
Okay Marry her

1151
01:51:13,938 --> 01:51:16,303
But there's a problem in it

1152
01:51:16,875 --> 01:51:18,208
What's the problem?

1153
01:51:18,209 --> 01:51:21,912
If only my Master gets Married
I can get Married

1154
01:51:21,913 --> 01:51:26,338
So I want you to bless that Master
gets Married soon

1155
01:51:32,691 --> 01:51:35,746
Yes sir,he also wants to
Marry soon

1156
01:51:39,164 --> 01:51:43,693
Crazy guy the game
will start now.

1157
01:51:44,703 --> 01:51:46,998
I've come only to see that

1158
01:51:47,005 --> 01:51:48,900
I don't understand you

1159
01:51:48,907 --> 01:51:51,274
Go home you'll understand

1160
01:51:53,712 --> 01:51:54,717
See you sir

1161
01:52:33,885 --> 01:52:37,220
Stop. Who are you?
Where are you going?

1162
01:52:37,322 --> 01:52:38,489
I'm asking you
isn't it?

1163
01:52:38,490 --> 01:52:40,325
They are Andhra Police

1164
01:52:40,825 --> 01:52:42,025
I've answered,isn't it

1165
01:52:42,026 --> 01:52:43,791
Why are you standing?

1166
01:52:45,897 --> 01:52:47,898
Someone by name Ranganayagi

1167
01:52:47,899 --> 01:52:50,267
Has absconded from home
& she is working here

1168
01:52:50,268 --> 01:52:53,204
Her uncle has come
with a Batalian

1169
01:53:04,549 --> 01:53:05,954
Oh!Oh!Who is it

1170
01:53:21,833 --> 01:53:24,768
Andhra will shiver
hearing his name

1171
01:53:24,803 --> 01:53:26,136
He was about to create a
big trouble

1172
01:53:26,137 --> 01:53:28,766
To stop that,I've
brought him

1173
01:53:29,107 --> 01:53:31,809
Don't talk law,send
her with him

1174
01:53:31,810 --> 01:53:32,810
Now I'll leave

1175
01:53:32,811 --> 01:53:33,886
Who are you?

1176
01:53:38,483 --> 01:53:42,088
You bloddy are you thinking
that I am mad?

1177
01:53:43,822 --> 01:53:46,824
I will see your madness,let us go
- Oh God

1178
01:53:46,825 --> 01:53:47,991
Stop that fellow!

1179
01:53:47,992 --> 01:53:48,797
Save her!

1180
01:53:48,827 --> 01:53:50,382
Stop him,Save her.

1181
01:53:50,829 --> 01:53:53,804
Oh!God no I'll not
come with you-

1182
01:53:55,166 --> 01:53:56,511
Hey,who are you

1183
01:53:57,836 --> 01:54:01,796
Where is it? It is here!
my name is Rayudu-

1184
01:54:02,340 --> 01:54:07,278
My place is Chittoor
This is my sister-in-law!

1185
01:54:07,645 --> 01:54:09,012
My dear come on
...let us go....

1186
01:54:09,013 --> 01:54:12,973
No please,don't send me
with him

1187
01:54:13,184 --> 01:54:16,186
You can't take her without
her will

1188
01:54:16,187 --> 01:54:19,382
You mean,You want me leave her
- Okay

1189
01:54:20,191 --> 01:54:22,696
Sister-in-law,I've
left you.

1190
01:54:26,364 --> 01:54:27,989
Who is this fellow?

1191
01:54:29,200 --> 01:54:31,985
How dare you lay
hand on Master.

1192
01:54:34,205 --> 01:54:37,670
You mad fellow-put an
end to his madness

1193
01:58:29,440 --> 01:58:30,185
"Brother"

1194
01:58:30,441 --> 01:58:32,756
I know everything
about you

1195
01:58:33,444 --> 01:58:35,612
If you come once again looking
for Ranganayagi

1196
01:58:35,613 --> 01:58:35,946
No... No.

1197
01:58:35,947 --> 01:58:38,115
I'll make you
into pieces

1198
01:58:38,116 --> 01:58:40,951
Still to make pieces nothing
remained in my body,brother!

1199
01:58:40,952 --> 01:58:44,087
Every thing is already
torn to pieces

1200
01:58:45,123 --> 01:58:53,930
Promise,In future I'll never cross my
town & put my step here in Tamil Nadu

1201
01:58:56,801 --> 01:59:06,800
Brother.Let me take my glasses &
Cigar without which no respect for me.

1202
01:59:22,493 --> 01:59:25,828
You fools,start the Vehicle
- let us go

1203
01:59:27,665 --> 01:59:30,000
They came to take
their girl

1204
01:59:30,001 --> 01:59:32,002
You should have send her

1205
01:59:32,003 --> 01:59:34,171
Don't we have any
other servants?

1206
01:59:34,172 --> 01:59:36,477
Why did you fight
for her?

1207
01:59:36,674 --> 01:59:40,209
What'll I do if something
happens to you?

1208
01:59:41,179 --> 01:59:42,664
Get me some Water

1209
01:59:42,847 --> 01:59:44,181
Nothing will happen,Mother

1210
01:59:44,182 --> 01:59:45,182
What,nothing will happen?

1211
01:59:45,183 --> 01:59:46,683
His face was looking
horrible

1212
01:59:46,684 --> 01:59:48,518
First send that girl
back to her house

1213
01:59:48,519 --> 01:59:50,624
How is it possible,Mother

1214
01:59:50,855 --> 01:59:53,310
I was against
getting Married

1215
01:59:53,858 --> 01:59:55,343
I changed my mind

1216
01:59:57,195 --> 01:59:59,590
Only after seeing
Ranganayagi

1217
02:00:05,870 --> 02:00:07,037
Because she was a
Drama artiste -

1218
02:00:07,038 --> 02:00:09,873
I was scared whether
you'd accept or not

1219
02:00:09,874 --> 02:00:11,769
Hence,I never told you

1220
02:00:11,876 --> 02:00:13,571
What are you saying?

1221
02:00:13,711 --> 02:00:16,840
Didn't you accept to
Marry Padmini?

1222
02:00:19,383 --> 02:00:21,384
What are you saying,Mother

1223
02:00:21,385 --> 02:00:23,513
I never had such an Idea

1224
02:00:34,565 --> 02:00:37,700
I thought you wanted
water for thirst

1225
02:00:38,069 --> 02:00:38,394
But

1226
02:00:42,240 --> 02:00:44,275
You've washed your hands

1227
02:00:45,576 --> 02:00:49,877
That's Okay,I'll leave

1228
02:00:52,750 --> 02:00:55,585
Padmini don't be in a haste
I shall...

1229
02:00:55,586 --> 02:00:57,087
I heard everything,aunty

1230
02:00:57,088 --> 02:00:58,556
Dear-No aunty

1231
02:00:59,924 --> 02:01:02,425
I'm not feeling sad
about it

1232
02:01:02,426 --> 02:01:07,057
See,there aren't
any hiccups

1233
02:01:18,609 --> 02:01:21,324
You don't know
about your uncle

1234
02:01:21,946 --> 02:01:24,447
Do you know what
he's capable of?

1235
02:01:24,448 --> 02:01:25,743
Whatever happens

1236
02:01:26,450 --> 02:01:29,420
I'll marry only Ranganayagi

1237
02:01:29,954 --> 02:01:30,549
If not

1238
02:01:32,123 --> 02:01:34,078
There's no life for me

1239
02:01:44,135 --> 02:01:47,304
Did I send you there
to come back like this?

1240
02:01:47,305 --> 02:01:49,472
Since you were so much
in Love with him

1241
02:01:49,473 --> 02:01:51,848
I asked pardon to
a servant

1242
02:01:52,977 --> 02:01:57,647
Do you know the pain I took to
bring Ranganayagi's uncle

1243
02:01:57,648 --> 02:01:58,775
Why?...Why?

1244
02:02:03,988 --> 02:02:05,616
Why did Muthu...

1245
02:02:10,494 --> 02:02:13,663
Why did Muthu hit
Ranganayagi's uncle?

1246
02:02:13,664 --> 02:02:15,332
Why does he support
her so much?

1247
02:02:15,333 --> 02:02:16,333
is it because,she's a
co-worker?

1248
02:02:16,334 --> 02:02:19,109
Not that,she's in
love with him

1249
02:02:19,337 --> 02:02:21,338
Might be because of that

1250
02:02:21,339 --> 02:02:23,006
Why didn't you
tell me?

1251
02:02:23,007 --> 02:02:25,652
Earlier when I said
you hit me

1252
02:02:25,843 --> 02:02:27,677
That's why I didn't talk
about that servant maid

1253
02:02:27,678 --> 02:02:28,845
Okay,you didn't tell me

1254
02:02:28,846 --> 02:02:31,901
But why didn't you tell
your master

1255
02:02:32,683 --> 02:02:35,685
From tomorrow your post
should raise

1256
02:02:35,686 --> 02:02:39,431
For which,tell your master
what ever you can

1257
02:02:43,194 --> 02:02:44,027
Where's Ranganayagi?

1258
02:02:44,028 --> 02:02:45,923
She went back just now

1259
02:02:56,040 --> 02:02:58,041
Why are you crying
like this?

1260
02:02:58,042 --> 02:03:00,277
I'm scared about
my uncle

1261
02:03:00,711 --> 02:03:02,712
He knows where I'm
right now

1262
02:03:02,713 --> 02:03:05,048
That's it,anything
might happen

1263
02:03:05,049 --> 02:03:06,883
He won't leave
this so easily

1264
02:03:06,884 --> 02:03:10,387
Tomorrow itself he might force
me to marry someone else

1265
02:03:10,388 --> 02:03:11,721
Nothing will happen
Ranganayagi

1266
02:03:11,722 --> 02:03:15,682
Look,anyone else,other
than you-

1267
02:03:16,227 --> 02:03:18,561
Who tries to tie the
auspicious thread....

1268
02:03:18,562 --> 02:03:19,896
It wouldn't be the auspicious thread
for me,but the lasso of execution

1269
02:03:19,897 --> 02:03:22,272
Why do you speak
like this?

1270
02:03:22,566 --> 02:03:24,567
Did I say,I wouldn't
marry you

1271
02:03:24,568 --> 02:03:26,603
Look,you know quite well

1272
02:03:27,238 --> 02:03:30,373
For me everything is
madam and master

1273
02:03:32,743 --> 02:03:34,911
I'll marry you when master
get's married

1274
02:03:34,912 --> 02:03:37,882
Always master,master....

1275
02:03:38,249 --> 02:03:41,418
If he doesn't marry
wouldn't we marry too

1276
02:03:41,419 --> 02:03:42,253
Ranganayagi,listen to me

1277
02:03:42,253 --> 02:03:44,087
Take your hands away
don't touch me

1278
02:03:44,088 --> 02:03:46,423
Look master she's
not accepting

1279
02:03:46,424 --> 02:03:49,489
But Muthu is threatening
to kill her

1280
02:03:52,596 --> 02:03:55,265
She has got some one
else in her mind

1281
02:03:55,266 --> 02:03:58,591
Even the he's forcing
her to marry him

1282
02:03:59,103 --> 02:04:01,478
He threatens,he'll
kill her

1283
02:04:02,773 --> 02:04:05,442
She's suffering this torture
everyday

1284
02:04:05,443 --> 02:04:09,279
If you don't inform madam
tomorrow about our marriage

1285
02:04:09,280 --> 02:04:12,185
I won't see you
nor speak to you

1286
02:04:12,783 --> 02:04:14,117
look here,Ranganayagi.....

1287
02:04:14,118 --> 02:04:16,483
I think,he won't
leave her

1288
02:04:21,792 --> 02:04:24,461
Not only this,there's
much more

1289
02:04:24,462 --> 02:04:27,107
He's being very unloyal
to you

1290
02:04:27,131 --> 02:04:28,131
That's what is hurting
me the most

1291
02:04:28,132 --> 02:04:29,966
But I am not supposed
to reveal all those

1292
02:04:29,967 --> 02:04:30,632
Tell me

1293
02:04:31,135 --> 02:04:36,139
He has complained mother that you are
spending most of your wealth on drama's

1294
02:04:36,140 --> 02:04:39,805
And has got half of the
wealth on his name

1295
02:04:39,810 --> 02:04:43,825
Acting like a son,he has
cheated you and mother

1296
02:04:58,496 --> 02:05:00,795
Master,it isn't moving

1297
02:05:00,998 --> 02:05:04,334
He was taking care isn't it?
it'll be only like him

1298
02:05:04,335 --> 02:05:06,990
Thrash nicely and
bring it here

1299
02:05:29,026 --> 02:05:32,028
How dare you raise your
hands on my horse?

1300
02:05:32,029 --> 02:05:35,865
Who gave you the permission
to get on my charriot?

1301
02:05:35,866 --> 02:05:36,531
Stop it

1302
02:05:38,035 --> 02:05:40,140
I gave him the permission

1303
02:05:43,541 --> 02:05:46,186
Master-don't call
me like that

1304
02:05:47,545 --> 02:05:51,090
Your hands musn't touch
the charriot again

1305
02:05:51,382 --> 02:05:54,167
Your feet musn't touch
this soil

1306
02:05:54,552 --> 02:05:57,127
You musn't come into
my sight

1307
02:05:58,556 --> 02:06:01,391
For the sin you have committed
I must have burnt you alive

1308
02:06:01,392 --> 02:06:05,117
But since you've been with me
I let you go

1309
02:06:05,229 --> 02:06:07,064
Better leave from here

1310
02:06:07,231 --> 02:06:08,398
What mistake did
I commit master?

1311
02:06:08,399 --> 02:06:09,404
Don't speak

1312
02:06:10,234 --> 02:06:11,234
I don't understand anything

1313
02:06:11,235 --> 02:06:14,980
Ay,Why are you simply standing
throw him out

1314
02:07:39,156 --> 02:07:39,961
Come dear

1315
02:07:54,338 --> 02:07:57,003
Charriot has come
without Muthu?

1316
02:07:58,008 --> 02:07:58,403
Come

1317
02:08:25,703 --> 02:08:27,203
If he doesn't go
even after this

1318
02:08:27,204 --> 02:08:29,173
I must drive him out

1319
02:08:29,373 --> 02:08:39,372
Is this life an enigma
who shall solve it

1320
02:08:51,562 --> 02:08:57,194
Will my hands hit me,will my
fingers hurt my eyes

1321
02:08:57,401 --> 02:09:03,486
Tears rolling down from my eyes
like river which never has happened before

1322
02:09:05,909 --> 02:09:11,371
I have no right
to question!

1323
02:09:12,916 --> 02:09:21,552
There's no justice
for the poor

1324
02:09:22,760 --> 02:09:28,063
Cow can become snake
due to false witness

1325
02:09:29,767 --> 02:09:39,766
<i>Y DD</i>

1326
02:09:45,115 --> 02:09:50,577
Your blood will ask you

1327
02:09:50,954 --> 02:09:55,585
What crime have I done?

1328
02:10:36,834 --> 02:10:37,989
What happened?

1329
02:10:40,671 --> 02:10:41,956
Where is Muthu?

1330
02:10:44,174 --> 02:10:45,669
Madam
- Come here

1331
02:10:49,179 --> 02:10:50,334
What Happened?

1332
02:10:51,849 --> 02:10:53,134
Where is Muthu?

1333
02:10:53,684 --> 02:10:54,419
Tell me?

1334
02:10:55,352 --> 02:10:58,417
Master has drived Muthu
out by force

1335
02:11:17,040 --> 02:11:27,039
Why did you beat Muthu
tell me?Why did you,tell....

1336
02:11:31,388 --> 02:11:34,713
Having sent muthu out
don't call me so

1337
02:11:36,894 --> 02:11:39,061
Is muthu more dearer to you
than your own son?

1338
02:11:39,062 --> 02:11:41,567
Yes,he is more
dearer to me.

1339
02:11:42,232 --> 02:11:44,734
If you come to know
what he realy is?

1340
02:11:44,735 --> 02:11:46,068
You wouldn't say so

1341
02:11:46,069 --> 02:11:48,404
What do you know
about Muthu?

1342
02:11:48,405 --> 02:11:50,907
Even after knowing
I love Ranganayagi

1343
02:11:50,908 --> 02:11:53,553
He has forced her
to marry him

1344
02:11:53,744 --> 02:11:55,077
I saw that myself

1345
02:11:55,078 --> 02:11:56,579
If you want,ask her

1346
02:11:56,580 --> 02:11:58,247
Why to ask her,you fool

1347
02:11:58,248 --> 02:11:59,248
I'll tell you

1348
02:11:59,249 --> 02:12:01,083
Ranganayagi doesn't
love you

1349
02:12:01,084 --> 02:12:02,779
She loves only Muthu

1350
02:12:10,594 --> 02:12:12,219
What Mother says is

1351
02:12:17,434 --> 02:12:20,629
I thought he cheated only
botht of us

1352
02:12:21,271 --> 02:12:22,772
He has cheated her too

1353
02:12:22,773 --> 02:12:23,606
What has he cheated?

1354
02:12:23,607 --> 02:12:25,274
Don't speak as if you
know nothing

1355
02:12:25,275 --> 02:12:27,443
He spoke ill about me
deceived you

1356
02:12:27,444 --> 02:12:28,945
Hasn,t he written half of
our wealth on his name?

1357
02:12:28,946 --> 02:12:30,112
Yuck,shut your mouth

1358
02:12:30,113 --> 02:12:33,788
Muthu hasn't cheated us
we are cheating him

1359
02:12:34,117 --> 02:12:36,832
We're living only
on his wealth

1360
02:12:37,287 --> 02:12:40,790
You've asked him not to step
on this soil

1361
02:12:40,791 --> 02:12:43,776
Only we must not step
on this soil

1362
02:12:43,961 --> 02:12:47,016
Because he's the Owner
of this soil

1363
02:12:47,297 --> 02:12:50,682
He's the one who has to
rule this soil

1364
02:12:51,134 --> 02:12:56,266
An Old man came here
like a beggar

1365
02:12:56,974 --> 02:12:58,929
Do you know who he is?

1366
02:12:59,309 --> 02:13:02,494
You know how he was
once upon a time

1367
02:16:07,664 --> 02:16:10,499
Why are you so happy
brother-in-law?

1368
02:16:10,500 --> 02:16:14,503
Because I'm going to become the
lord of a big Kingdom,that's why

1369
02:16:14,504 --> 02:16:17,909
Is it because he has
adopted your child?

1370
02:16:18,842 --> 02:16:21,217
You only paved way
for that

1371
02:16:21,511 --> 02:16:23,336
Will I play with you?

1372
02:16:23,680 --> 02:16:25,715
Not only because of that

1373
02:16:26,183 --> 02:16:31,815
Also his wife expired who
could be a hindrance

1374
02:16:32,022 --> 02:16:33,522
The one who went away
was not a hindrance

1375
02:16:33,523 --> 02:16:35,968
Only her baby
is a hindrance

1376
02:16:37,360 --> 02:16:40,529
If you think your son will
inherit this wealth

1377
02:16:40,530 --> 02:16:42,015
Then you're wrong

1378
02:16:42,032 --> 02:16:43,699
After Landlord's death

1379
02:16:43,700 --> 02:16:46,355
His son will inherit
the wealth

1380
02:16:46,369 --> 02:16:48,037
Then,what about you?

1381
02:16:48,038 --> 02:16:51,040
What about my Sister,who's
depending on you?

1382
02:16:51,041 --> 02:16:54,646
What about me,who's depending
on you both?

1383
02:16:56,046 --> 02:16:57,881
What are you thinking?

1384
02:16:57,881 --> 02:16:59,381
Fools have one way

1385
02:16:59,382 --> 02:17:02,247
Ambalathar has 1000 ways
come here

1386
02:17:09,059 --> 02:17:12,518
Brother-in-law,Careful
documents

1387
02:17:50,433 --> 02:17:52,818
Ay,Work slowly and
carefully

1388
02:17:54,104 --> 02:17:56,399
Sir is in prayer
Isn't it

1389
02:18:05,115 --> 02:18:11,419
You had Promised to get 100 couples
marry & donate land to them,Isn't it!

1390
02:18:11,788 --> 02:18:15,457
If you sign these documents
Rest could be taken care

1391
02:18:15,458 --> 02:18:16,255
Minister

1392
02:18:16,626 --> 02:18:19,761
He's arranging for the
Mass Marriage!

1393
02:19:03,340 --> 02:19:13,339
Where will we go?

1394
02:19:25,028 --> 02:19:28,093
What are you watching
Chase them out

1395
02:19:36,039 --> 02:19:38,614
Oh God!Order them
to stop it!

1396
02:19:39,542 --> 02:19:42,044
Hubby,If Landlord comes to
know,he'll get angry!

1397
02:19:42,045 --> 02:19:43,843
Order them to stop

1398
02:19:44,214 --> 02:19:45,019
Be quiet!

1399
02:20:05,402 --> 02:20:08,372
Stop it!

1400
02:20:39,102 --> 02:20:40,257
What happened?

1401
02:20:40,603 --> 02:20:41,937
Why are they beating you?

1402
02:20:41,938 --> 02:20:44,908
You give us without
we asking you

1403
02:20:45,275 --> 02:20:48,944
When injustice happens to
you,we can't stay idle!

1404
02:20:48,945 --> 02:20:52,281
When we come to tell you the truth
but they are not allowing us inside.

1405
02:20:52,282 --> 02:20:54,450
They're beating and
chassing us out,Boss!

1406
02:20:54,451 --> 02:20:57,586
Injustuce to me? What are
you saying?

1407
02:20:57,787 --> 02:21:04,091
The land document gifted by you
in our marriage proved invalid!

1408
02:21:05,462 --> 02:21:05,857
Why?

1409
02:21:06,129 --> 02:21:09,534
Because those lands
are not on your name

1410
02:21:14,971 --> 02:21:17,136
Then on Whose name is it?

1411
02:21:17,807 --> 02:21:23,940
On your most loved cousin
Rajasekar's name

1412
02:21:29,819 --> 02:21:33,155
Not only this,boss,we are being
cheated on many counts!

1413
02:21:33,156 --> 02:21:38,131
Boss,we are not getting any of
the benefits anounsed by you

1414
02:21:38,161 --> 02:21:42,256
This type of mistske will
never happen in future!

1415
02:21:50,507 --> 02:21:51,722
Please come up

1416
02:22:02,018 --> 02:22:02,693
Minister

1417
02:22:57,907 --> 02:23:07,874
Hubby

1418
02:23:09,252 --> 02:23:11,551
He's calling you,go

1419
02:23:32,942 --> 02:23:35,577
I didn't see you
as my cousin

1420
02:23:35,612 --> 02:23:38,047
I saw you as my
own brother

1421
02:23:39,115 --> 02:23:41,744
You shouldn't have
done this

1422
02:23:43,286 --> 02:23:45,441
What didn't I do for you

1423
02:23:45,622 --> 02:23:49,923
Since we didn't have a child
we adopted your child

1424
02:23:52,629 --> 02:23:55,929
Is it game of fate
or God's will

1425
02:23:57,300 --> 02:23:59,428
My Wife,that Goddess!

1426
02:24:00,136 --> 02:24:03,211
...Before dying presented
me an heir!

1427
02:24:04,474 --> 02:24:09,229
We never take back what we've said
and what we've given

1428
02:24:09,812 --> 02:24:11,980
The day my child
was born

1429
02:24:11,981 --> 02:24:17,566
That day itself I've transfered all my
Wealth on your child's name

1430
02:24:21,658 --> 02:24:25,160
I haven't given any charity from
the property given to your Son!

1431
02:24:25,161 --> 02:24:30,706
To upkeep my ancestors tradtions
I had kept separately 100 Villages!

1432
02:24:31,534 --> 02:24:35,209
Now I shall transfer even that
on your name

1433
02:24:52,355 --> 02:24:55,470
This is the will on
your son's name

1434
02:24:55,692 --> 02:24:58,197
This is the life
of the poor

1435
02:25:02,031 --> 02:25:06,662
Mr.Rajasekar,I've forgiven
you for cheating me!

1436
02:25:07,870 --> 02:25:12,625
But for what you've done to the
poor even if we forgive

1437
02:25:16,379 --> 02:25:17,244
I'm going

1438
02:25:18,047 --> 02:25:20,432
Brother where are
you going?

1439
02:25:22,051 --> 02:25:23,806
The World is too big

1440
02:25:27,056 --> 02:25:31,858
Brother,please don't leave us
and go away

1441
02:25:32,061 --> 02:25:34,396
He had committed a mistake in
the avarice for the property!

1442
02:25:34,397 --> 02:25:40,029
Brother,we don't want this
property!Please don't leave us & go

1443
02:25:41,738 --> 02:25:46,241
We never take back what we've said
and what we've given

1444
02:25:46,242 --> 02:25:46,847
Brother

1445
02:25:48,911 --> 02:25:52,796
When you decide something,no
one can alter it!

1446
02:25:53,416 --> 02:25:54,911
Everyone knows it!

1447
02:25:55,418 --> 02:25:58,587
I'll ask you one thing
for the last time!

1448
02:25:58,588 --> 02:26:00,073
Will you give me?

1449
02:26:00,590 --> 02:26:03,845
What's there with me now
to give you?

1450
02:26:04,093 --> 02:26:05,220
Your... Child

1451
02:26:08,097 --> 02:26:13,559
By bringing up your son,we'll get
atoned atleast from few sin's!

1452
02:26:14,771 --> 02:26:17,506
Give me atleast
that opportunity!

1453
02:26:32,121 --> 02:26:33,816
But on one condition

1454
02:26:34,123 --> 02:26:37,582
Bring him as an
Ordinary man

1455
02:26:38,294 --> 02:26:41,129
Even shadow of Money
musn't fall on him

1456
02:26:41,130 --> 02:26:43,085
I'll come back one day

1457
02:26:43,466 --> 02:26:48,301
Untill then,no one should know
the truth whose son,he is?

1458
02:26:48,304 --> 02:26:51,103
This is a promise on me

1459
02:27:24,841 --> 02:27:25,376
Father

1460
02:27:26,509 --> 02:27:31,554
You used to say that cheated
is more siner than the cheater!

1461
02:27:31,848 --> 02:27:34,015
I had been cheated
Father

1462
02:27:34,016 --> 02:27:36,731
I stand before you
as a convict

1463
02:27:38,855 --> 02:27:39,730
Forgive me

1464
02:27:42,191 --> 02:27:52,190
Is this life an enigma
who shall solve it

1465
02:28:04,380 --> 02:28:09,683
This is your Kingdom,don't
part with it,good man

1466
02:28:09,886 --> 02:28:16,349
If you're there to perform good
deeds,problems won't be seen

1467
02:28:18,895 --> 02:28:28,894
You gave happiness in life,why do
you give tears in eyes now

1468
02:28:35,411 --> 02:28:40,714
When epics are waiting
to speak your life

1469
02:28:57,934 --> 02:29:03,566
If you head north
seeking for life

1470
02:29:16,619 --> 02:29:17,746
Madam!

1471
02:29:28,631 --> 02:29:31,486
To keep up the
Landlord's promise

1472
02:29:31,801 --> 02:29:34,771
And to save Muthu
from my brother

1473
02:29:35,638 --> 02:29:38,763
I showed a servant
maid's dead child

1474
02:29:40,476 --> 02:29:44,277
And lied that Landlord's
child is dead

1475
02:29:44,981 --> 02:29:48,256
Without anyone's knowledge
we came here

1476
02:29:49,986 --> 02:29:52,153
The one who's looking
like a beggar

1477
02:29:52,154 --> 02:29:55,819
This is only part of the
alms he had given

1478
02:29:57,660 --> 02:30:00,855
Where will the old man
be now,Mother?

1479
02:30:02,498 --> 02:30:06,493
One who has to be a King
is under a tree now!

1480
02:30:07,169 --> 02:30:10,374
I had called him home
several times...

1481
02:30:12,675 --> 02:30:15,110
I'll go and call him,Mother!

1482
02:30:17,013 --> 02:30:20,628
I thought!in the Beginning
itself,I thought

1483
02:30:20,683 --> 02:30:24,168
I suspected that Muthu
looks like Landlord

1484
02:30:24,353 --> 02:30:25,288
It's right

1485
02:30:26,188 --> 02:30:29,863
She has cheated me,my
Sister has cheated me

1486
02:30:30,026 --> 02:30:32,360
She cheated me lying that
the child died

1487
02:30:32,361 --> 02:30:34,660
I won't leave this

1488
02:30:35,031 --> 02:30:36,698
I won't be fooled
once again

1489
02:30:36,699 --> 02:30:39,674
Hey!come we'll kill
my son-in-law

1490
02:30:40,036 --> 02:30:43,721
The Landlord...-Who's
the Landlord?Hey fool!

1491
02:30:44,540 --> 02:30:48,043
I know law more than
the supreme court judge

1492
02:30:48,044 --> 02:30:51,546
If Muthu complains that everyone
cheated his Father

1493
02:30:51,547 --> 02:30:54,049
He'll get back all
the property!

1494
02:30:54,050 --> 02:30:56,975
Before that,we'll kill
your Master

1495
02:30:57,386 --> 02:30:59,721
Then,we'll put the
blame on Muthu

1496
02:30:59,722 --> 02:31:01,190
Then see...

1497
02:31:01,390 --> 02:31:04,392
Public will beat him for
killing the Landlord

1498
02:31:04,393 --> 02:31:07,062
In between the chaos,let
our men kill him

1499
02:31:07,063 --> 02:31:09,898
Then wealth goes to my
childless sister

1500
02:31:09,899 --> 02:31:11,399
We'll send her up
after sometime

1501
02:31:11,400 --> 02:31:14,859
Then I'm the King &
you are the bishop

1502
02:31:45,434 --> 02:31:45,829
Stop

1503
02:31:52,108 --> 02:31:54,442
Don't we need evidence
for his death?

1504
02:31:54,443 --> 02:31:56,008
Remove his Slippers

1505
02:32:01,117 --> 02:32:02,672
Now throw him away

1506
02:32:02,785 --> 02:32:06,530
Not even a piece of Bone
should be recovered

1507
02:32:22,138 --> 02:32:23,638
They had killed
the Landlord!

1508
02:32:23,639 --> 02:32:26,808
I found only this Towel and
Slippers by river side

1509
02:32:26,809 --> 02:32:34,273
Muthu has murdered the Landlord
everybody come

1510
02:32:34,483 --> 02:32:37,152
I found only this Towel and Slippers
by river side!

1511
02:32:37,153 --> 02:32:47,152
Muthu has murdered the Landlord
everybody,please come!

1512
02:32:53,002 --> 02:32:54,502
Where is the Master?

1513
02:32:54,503 --> 02:32:56,058
You had killed him

1514
02:33:08,184 --> 02:33:12,144
Tell me,what did you
do to my Master?

1515
02:33:12,521 --> 02:33:14,076
You had killed him

1516
02:33:24,366 --> 02:33:28,369
Look here,nothing has
happened to him,isn't it?

1517
02:33:28,370 --> 02:33:30,185
He's alive,isn't it?

1518
02:33:30,206 --> 02:33:32,004
Tell me,where is he?

1519
02:33:32,374 --> 02:33:34,375
Sinner,you had beaten
him to death

1520
02:33:34,376 --> 02:33:37,045
In a angry mood he
ordered to beat you

1521
02:33:37,046 --> 02:33:42,091
For which you had killed and
thrown him in the River,Sinner!

1522
02:33:54,897 --> 02:33:55,897
It seems the Landlord
is dead

1523
02:33:55,898 --> 02:33:58,213
Muthu and Kali
are fighting

1524
02:35:10,973 --> 02:35:14,603
Don't harm me!Don't
harm me,Muthu

1525
02:35:23,652 --> 02:35:26,281
Don't harm me,Muthu

1526
02:35:27,156 --> 02:35:32,401
I only killed the Landlord,But
only on Ambalathar's word,I did

1527
02:35:33,662 --> 02:35:36,962
Why did you kill my son?
oh God!

1528
02:35:37,333 --> 02:35:40,462
Hey!are you scared?

1529
02:35:41,003 --> 02:35:44,505
You had killed the Landlord and
have beat him badly

1530
02:35:44,506 --> 02:35:46,507
Why won't he take the
blame on himself?

1531
02:35:46,508 --> 02:35:48,953
Are you watching fun
hit him

1532
02:36:56,078 --> 02:36:58,193
Hey!Ambalathar is escaping

1533
02:36:58,580 --> 02:37:00,378
Catch him

1534
02:38:19,828 --> 02:38:20,763
Son-in-law

1535
02:38:21,830 --> 02:38:24,955
You said,you won't Marry
my daughter

1536
02:38:26,502 --> 02:38:29,837
That's why in the anger I
did all this
!

1537
02:38:29,838 --> 02:38:31,263
Please forgive me

1538
02:38:32,174 --> 02:38:33,249
Not only you

1539
02:38:33,675 --> 02:38:36,670
We all have done injustice
to Muthu

1540
02:38:37,846 --> 02:38:40,011
He only has to
Pardon us

1541
02:38:42,518 --> 02:38:45,019
Master,nothing has
happened to you

1542
02:38:45,020 --> 02:38:46,025
You're safe

1543
02:38:51,360 --> 02:38:54,085
How much ever I
insulted you....

1544
02:38:55,531 --> 02:38:56,886
Forgive me,Muthu

1545
02:38:57,699 --> 02:39:00,669
Why asking my forgiveness?

1546
02:39:03,038 --> 02:39:03,843
Come dear

1547
02:39:11,880 --> 02:39:16,384
I was about to tell you,but you
yourself understood it.

1548
02:39:16,385 --> 02:39:19,887
But now-a-days,I am unable to understand
What & Why its happening?

1549
02:39:19,888 --> 02:39:23,913
It's better that you don't
understand something!

1550
02:39:24,226 --> 02:39:26,881
Mother wait,we'll get
blessings

1551
02:39:27,896 --> 02:39:30,731
You shouldn't get
blessing from me

1552
02:39:30,732 --> 02:39:34,569
What's this Boss?Who else
will bless this Orphan?

1553
02:39:34,570 --> 02:39:35,515
You Father!

1554
02:39:39,575 --> 02:39:43,034
Yes Muthu,your Father
saved me

1555
02:39:50,085 --> 02:39:52,740
What are you telling
me Master?

1556
02:40:31,460 --> 02:40:32,815
Where is Father?

1557
02:40:33,962 --> 02:40:36,327
Doesn't he like
to see me?

1558
02:40:37,299 --> 02:40:43,234
I didn't do anything wrong,he could
have blessed me atleast while going

1559
02:40:45,140 --> 02:40:46,485
