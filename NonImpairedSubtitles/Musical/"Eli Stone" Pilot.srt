00:00:28,400 --> 00:00:29,600
Are you my guides?

00:00:31,100 --> 00:00:32,400
I'm eli stone.

3
00:00:33,200 --> 00:00:34,400
Eli stone.

4
00:00:35,100 --> 00:00:37,400
I arranged a trek through
the ranikhet travel agency.

5
00:00:37,700 --> 00:00:40,100
I'm going to the base
of the panch chuli peaks.

6
00:00:40,100 --> 00:00:43,200
That's a laptop, so you--
You know, you might wanna...

7
00:00:43,400 --> 00:00:44,800
i'll--I'll carry
this one myself.

8
00:00:44,800 --> 00:00:46,400
Thank you. I got it. Thanks.

9
00:00:46,500 --> 00:00:49,300
* and you've gotta
find a way to be okay *

10
00:00:49,300 --> 00:00:50,900
<i>(Eli) hey, it's me eli.</i>

i'm a little underdressed</i>

12
00:00:53,000 --> 00:00:55,200
<i>For the altitude, so
i promise to be brief.</i>

13
00:00:58,600 --> 00:01:00,000
I'm fine

14
00:01:00,400 --> 00:01:01,500
I'm all right.

15
00:01:02,300 --> 00:01:04,000
I'm just gonna-- I'm
gonna walk for a while.

16
00:01:04,400 --> 00:01:06,900
I've been sitting for
the last 30 hours, so...

17
00:01:07,700 --> 00:01:08,800
<i>i'm a lawyer.</i>

00:01:15,300 --> 00:01:17,200
<i>You probably haven't
heard of us. (Chuckles)</i>

23
00:01:17,700 --> 00:01:22,000
Wow. Guys? Guys,
could-- Guys? Guys?

24
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:24,000
Guys, could you-- Could
you take my picture?

25
00:01:24,400 --> 00:01:27,400
Here, uh, this--This--
That light's gonna come on

26
00:01:27,600 --> 00:01:29,200
When it's ready to flash.

27
00:01:30,800 --> 00:01:33,700
Like i've never used
a disposable before?

28
00:01:33,900 --> 00:01:35,200
What do you
think-- Sunglasses?

29
00:01:35,300 --> 00:01:37,000
* you need to worry

30
00:01:37,000 --> 00:01:38,300
No, no sunglasses.

31
00:01:39,000 --> 00:01:40,900
It's gonna be a long week.

32
00:01:40,900 --> 00:01:42,900
<i>Let's see-- Lawyer,

34
00:01:47,200 --> 00:01:48,900

yeah, i was shocked, too.</i>

<i>Okay, so maybe i wasn't
exactly saintlike.</i>

42
00:02:06,200 --> 00:02:07,100
<i>But i didn't mind that</i>

43
00:02:07,100 --> 00:02:09,400
<i>I wasn't the idealistic
kid i used to be.</i>

being that guy--</i>

45

<i>You know, the guy you see in an office</i>

46
00:02:12,900 --> 00:02:14,300
<i>Or across the restaurant and you think,</i>

47
00:02:14,300 --> 00:02:15,600
<i>"That guy has it all."</i>

48
00:02:16,200 --> 00:02:17,700
<i>Hell, i thought i did.</i>

49
00:02:19,500 --> 00:02:21,700
<i>And then i heard the music.</i>

00:02:47,600 --> 00:02:49,200
There's an intercom, brando.

57
00:02:49,200 --> 00:02:51,100
I swear, it's like
we work in a cleaners.

58
00:02:51,100 --> 00:02:55,500
Do you hear that music? It's been
playing all morning. What music?

59
00:02:58,400 --> 00:02:59,400
There was music playing.

60
00:02:59,400 --> 00:03:01,100
I was wondering maybe you
could do something about it.

61
00:03:01,100 --> 00:03:03,500
You want me to do something
about music i can't hear?

62
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:05,700
Forget it. Is my 2:30 here?

63
00:03:06,600 --> 00:03:08,000
They're in the conference room.

64
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:10,300
Also, the fiance?Called.

65
00:03:10,300 --> 00:03:11,700
Taylor called? Why didn't you tell me?

66
00:03:11,700 --> 00:03:13,400
You told me not to bother you.

67
00:03:13,400 --> 00:03:15,100
Since when does taylor bother me?

68
00:03:15,100 --> 00:03:17,000
Well, all right, i was thinking of me.

69
00:03:17,000 --> 00:03:18,500
Okay, from now on, there's a moratorium

70
00:03:18,500 --> 00:03:20,300
On discussion concerning my future wife.

71
00:03:20,300 --> 00:03:23,699
(Scoffs) that includes e-Mails
and nasty facial expressions

72
00:03:23,700 --> 00:03:25,700
And not telling me
when she's on the phone.

73
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:28,100
You take all the fun out of this job.

74
00:03:30,400 --> 00:03:32,100
$60,000?

75
00:03:33,500 --> 00:03:34,600
$60,000?!

76
00:03:34,700 --> 00:03:36,600
Saying the number twice
doesn't double it, you know.

77
00:03:36,600 --> 00:03:38,800
Y-You're gonna have
to add another zero.

78
00:03:38,800 --> 00:03:41,500
(Man) really? Okay. Let's see...

79
00:03:41,600 --> 00:03:43,900
$60,000 plus zero equals...

80
00:03:43,900 --> 00:03:46,000
Wa... $60,000!

81
00:03:46,900 --> 00:03:49,000
What about $80,000?

82
00:03:49,100 --> 00:03:50,600
<i>(Music starts) hmm... no.</i>

83
00:03:51,700 --> 00:03:55,000
What?
I'm--I'm...

84
00:03:56,500 --> 00:03:58,500
what is that, like
an organ or something?

85
00:04:00,700 --> 00:04:02,300
M-My cell phone plays "ode to joy,"

86
00:04:02,300 --> 00:04:05,200
But it's on vibrate.
What, three law degrees,

87
00:04:05,200 --> 00:04:08,200
And all you guys can talk about
is organ music and ringtones?

88
00:04:08,200 --> 00:04:09,700
Look, the only reason i came here today

89
00:04:09,800 --> 00:04:11,300
Was because i thought
beutel was interested

90
00:04:11,300 --> 00:04:15,200
In finally doing the right
thing. Ms. Keller, ???

91
00:04:15,200 --> 00:04:16,800
By the vaccine court,
and they determined

92
00:04:16,800 --> 00:04:21,000
Our client's vaccine didn't cause your
son's autism. Wow, except for "client,"

93
00:04:21,000 --> 00:04:23,100
Just about every word in
that sentence was wrong.

94
00:04:23,100 --> 00:04:25,200
First, it wasn't your client's vaccine.

95
00:04:25,300 --> 00:04:27,700
It was a preservative
in it. It wasn't a urt.

96
00:04:27,900 --> 00:04:29,500
It was a procedural hoop
i had to jump through

97
00:04:29,500 --> 00:04:31,000
In order to get here.
And they didn't say

98
00:04:31,000 --> 00:04:33,000
Your client's vaccine
didn't cause my son's autism.

99
00:04:33,000 --> 00:04:35,700
They only said i couldn't
prove it. You still can't.

100
00:04:36,100 --> 00:04:38,300
No credible scientist
and no reputable study

101
00:04:38,300 --> 00:04:40,200
Has been able to prove
a causal connection

102
00:04:40,200 --> 00:04:42,400
Between mercuritol and autism.

103
00:04:42,400 --> 00:04:43,600
Then why is beutel

104
00:04:43,600 --> 00:04:46,200
The only vaccine manufacturer
who still uses it?

105
00:04:46,200 --> 00:04:47,600
You really wanna find out?

106
00:04:47,900 --> 00:04:50,500
Lobby beutel's board
to make you the c.E.O.

107
00:04:50,600 --> 00:04:52,400
You've got about as
much chance odoing that

108
00:04:52,400 --> 00:04:54,200
As you do of winning this at trial.

109
00:04:54,200 --> 00:04:56,500
<i>It would still be a trial, mr. Dowd.</i>

110
00:04:56,500 --> 00:04:58,200
And even if the jury doesn't believe me,

111
00:04:58,200 --> 00:05:00,700
Maybe everybody reading
about the trial will,

112
00:05:00,700 --> 00:05:01,700
And maybe they'll make sure

113
00:05:01,700 --> 00:05:05,700
Not to use your client's product
to vaccinate their kids. Ms. Keller,

114
00:05:05,700 --> 00:05:07,900
You know the first thing
i learned about litigation?

115
00:05:07,900 --> 00:05:09,400
Client's won't know if you pad the bill?

116
00:05:10,800 --> 00:05:11,800
(Chuckles) okay, the second thing.

117
00:05:12,300 --> 00:05:13,400
????

118
00:05:13,400 --> 00:05:15,600
What you can prove in a court of law.

119
00:05:15,700 --> 00:05:18,700
Now we can offer you $90,000.

120
00:05:19,600 --> 00:05:21,300
I sincerely recommend you take it

121
00:05:21,300 --> 00:05:22,900
And get on with your life.

122
00:05:29,400 --> 00:05:30,900
$90,000's good.

123
00:05:34,900 --> 00:05:36,800
Hey, the music. D-Do
you hear the music?

124
00:05:36,800 --> 00:05:38,700
(Taylor) yes! Yes, i hear the music!

125
00:05:39,100 --> 00:05:40,700
No, seriously, there's music playing.

126
00:05:47,900 --> 00:05:50,300
George michael! That's who it is!

127
00:05:50,300 --> 00:05:52,300
George michael? What the
hell are you talking about?

128
00:05:52,300 --> 00:05:55,800
His song... uh, "faith."
Okay, not to be a prude, eli,

129
00:05:55,800 --> 00:05:57,500
But i've got a deposition
at 8:00 tomorrow morning,

130
00:05:57,500 --> 00:06:00,700
So could we forgo the role-Playing this
one time? I'm not--I'm not role-Playing.

131
00:06:00,700 --> 00:06:02,900
????

132
00:06:02,900 --> 00:06:05,800
It's been following me around all
day. A song has been following you?

133
00:06:05,800 --> 00:06:08,100
<i>Seriously, you don't hear it?
* oh, but i need some time off *</i>

134
00:06:08,100 --> 00:06:10,600
<i>* from that emotion if i say
yes, will you come back to bed?</i>

135
00:06:11,600 --> 00:06:14,700
It's coming from the living
room. I'm glad something's coming!

That's not funny, nathan.

Mm, yeah, i was afraid of that.

???

143
00:06:55,400 --> 00:06:57,400
You have conjoined
butts in your cranium,

144

Which actually, it makes
you a double-Butthead.

145

Aughs) look, aside from
the mild concussion you got

146
00:07:05,200 --> 00:07:06,200
When your head hit the planter,

147

You are in medical terms

I-I can't be fine.

149
00:07:10,200 --> 00:07:13,600
George michael was in my living
room. There is nothing ????

150
00:07:13,600 --> 00:07:15,900
It's just stress. Stress
gives you premature grays.

151
00:07:15,900 --> 00:07:17,600
It doesn't make legendary
british pop stars

152

Sing their greatest hits live from your
couch. This is typical bonehead eli.

00:07:21,400 --> 00:07:22,700
The seco you get your life together,

154
00:07:22,700 --> 00:07:25,300
You think of some way to
ruin it. Call mom, would you?

155
00:07:25,500 --> 00:07:28,700
What am i supposed to do if george
michael comes back? Get an autograph.

156
00:07:31,200 --> 00:07:32,200
Eli?

157
00:07:33,800 --> 00:07:34,700
Eli?

158
00:07:34,900 --> 00:07:35,900
Eli!

159
00:07:37,200 --> 00:07:40,300
<i>And you say i yell. That's the
number for my acupuncturist--</i>

160
00:07:40,300 --> 00:07:41,400
Dr. Chen in chinatown.

161
00:07:41,400 --> 00:07:43,000
He's a miracle worker.

162
00:07:43,100 --> 00:07:44,000
My friend
viv--

163
00:07:44,000 --> 00:07:48,600
<i>He cured her tennis elbow
and constipation in one visit.</i>

164
00:07:48,600 --> 00:07:52,000
Well, good for viv. But i don't
believe in that stuff, so...

165
00:07:52,100 --> 00:07:54,200
for a guy with auditory hallucinations,

166
00:07:54,200 --> 00:07:56,600
You sure are judgmental.

167
00:07:57,000 --> 00:07:58,400
Your 2:00 is here.

168
00:07:59,200 --> 00:08:00,600
I don't have a 2:00.

169
00:08:03,500 --> 00:08:05,100
???

170
00:08:05,100 --> 00:08:06,700
Don't say anything. Patti!

171
00:08:06,900 --> 00:08:09,000
Don't speak. It'd be an
ex parte conversation.

172
00:08:09,000 --> 00:08:10,900
You're represented by
counsel. Not anymore.

173
00:08:10,900 --> 00:08:12,200
Then have your new attorney contact me.

174
00:08:12,200 --> 00:08:13,900
???

175
00:08:13,900 --> 00:08:15,500
In the meantime, have a nice day.

176
00:08:15,500 --> 00:08:17,900
Patti can validate your
parking. I realized yesterday

177
00:08:17,900 --> 00:08:19,200
???

178
00:08:19,200 --> 00:08:21,300
Is if i have an attorney who
plays at matt dowd's level,

179
00:08:21,300 --> 00:08:22,600
And i think i found him.

180
00:08:22,600 --> 00:08:24,500
He graduated valedictorian
at stanford law,

181
00:08:24,500 --> 00:08:25,600
He clerked for ginsburg,

182
00:08:25,600 --> 00:08:28,900
And he's an eighth-Year associate
at a blue chip firm. That's me.

183
00:08:28,900 --> 00:08:33,300
You're talking about me. Why--Why you
talking about me? Because i want you

184
00:08:34,200 --> 00:08:37,300
(Chuckles) that's impossible.
I-I can't sue my own client.

185
00:08:38,000 --> 00:08:40,100
There's an entire canon
of ethics prohibiting it,

186
00:08:40,100 --> 00:08:41,800
And i'm pretty sure
that they call it a canon

187
00:08:41,800 --> 00:08:42,800
'Cause it could kill me.

188
00:08:42,800 --> 00:08:45,600
<i>Blake vs. Elkin, overmeyer vs. Fordes,</i>

189
00:08:45,600 --> 00:08:46,600
An article in the 2003
"harvard law review."

190
00:08:46,600 --> 00:08:48,700
You see, this is why
the internet is evil.

191
00:08:48,700 --> 00:08:51,700
Your firm sets up something
called a chinese wall.

192
00:08:54,400 --> 00:08:57,200
I might be able to squeeze an
extra 10 grand out of beutel.

193
00:08:58,000 --> 00:08:59,200
Now that's $100,000.

194
00:08:59,200 --> 00:09:02,300
That vaccine made my son sick,
and it's still on the market.

195
00:09:05,500 --> 00:09:06,400
But...

196
00:09:07,600 --> 00:09:08,500
i...

197
00:09:09,500 --> 00:09:10,600
i'm sorry.

198
00:09:13,100 --> 00:09:14,300
(Whispers) yeah.

199
00:09:16,000 --> 00:09:17,100
(Normal voice) oh, well.

200
00:09:17,900 --> 00:09:20,000
I had to try... right?

201
00:09:25,000 --> 00:09:26,500
Bye, eli.

202
00:10:47,700 --> 00:10:48,300
I got it

203
00:10:54,600 --> 00:10:56,500
Your place is not that easy to locate.

204
00:10:56,800 --> 00:10:58,100
I meani'm no marketer,

205
00:10:58,100 --> 00:10:59,900
But a little signage
would do you wonders.

206

people who need find dr. Chen.

207
00:11:02,700 --> 00:11:04,000
Now "relah." "Cloh" eye.

208
00:11:05,500 --> 00:11:08,000
Oh, relax and close my eyes.

209
00:11:08,000 --> 00:11:10,300
You smart. Must be good lawyer.

210
00:11:12,100 --> 00:11:14,700
You say george michael
have great meaning to you.

211
00:11:14,700 --> 00:11:17,500
Uh, i-I say george michael
was in my living room.

212
00:11:17,700 --> 00:11:19,200
He doesn't have great meaning.

213
00:11:19,400 --> 00:11:21,400
Yes. You no remember.

214
00:11:21,600 --> 00:11:23,400
I no remember because he doesn't.

215
00:11:23,500 --> 00:11:25,800
You must make peace george michael.

216
00:11:26,000 --> 00:11:27,500
Maybe i should call his publicist.

217
00:11:27,500 --> 00:11:28,600
Ah! (Clicks tongue)

218
00:11:28,600 --> 00:11:30,800
Dr. Chen help you remember.

219
00:11:37,800 --> 00:11:39,400
Is this your first time?

220
00:11:39,900 --> 00:11:41,100
No, i...

221
00:11:41,700 --> 00:11:45,000
well, h-H-How would
you define "first time"?

222
00:11:45,700 --> 00:11:47,100
I thought so.

223
00:11:48,000 --> 00:11:49,400
Okay, we need some music.

224
00:11:50,700 --> 00:11:54,700
Oh, my god, eli. You have
a george michael album?

225
00:11:55,100 --> 00:11:58,000
What are you doing with
a george michael album?

226
00:11:58,000 --> 00:12:00,300
It's my roommate's. He's in theater.

227
00:12:01,200 --> 00:12:04,100
Whoa, i-I-I-I can't lose
it to george michael.

228
00:12:04,500 --> 00:12:07,100
Well, we can just make out
then. Or it could, you know,

229
00:12:07,100 --> 00:12:10,100
Make the whole
experience... more memorab.

230

<i>* baby</i>

231
00:12:13,800 --> 00:12:15,000
You're cute, eli,

232
00:12:15,000 --> 00:12:17,700
In a geeky, late
bloomer-Ish sort of way.

233
00:12:18,000 --> 00:12:19,200
Lo. Bed

234
00:12:19,400 --> 00:12:20,500
Mm...

235
00:12:21,300 --> 00:12:24,500
not yet, you haven't, but you will.

236
00:12:24,600 --> 00:12:27,000
By the time you're that
lawyer changing the world,

237
00:12:27,400 --> 00:12:30,100
You are gonna be hot.

238
00:12:35,900 --> 00:12:39,300
C.L.A., 1991. You were
lizzie then, not beth.

239
00:12:39,300 --> 00:12:42,100
Your hair was straight, and
we had sex to george michael.

240
00:12:42,400 --> 00:12:45,100
It was 15 years ago, but it was
you. My hair was never straight.

241
00:12:45,200 --> 00:12:46,000
????

242
00:12:46,000 --> 00:12:49,000
Why didn't you say something?
'Cause it was one night,

243
00:12:49,000 --> 00:12:50,700
And it's not like you remembered me.

244
00:12:51,000 --> 00:12:52,800
Come on, eli, we were
both stoned on pot brownies

245
00:12:52,800 --> 00:12:56,400
And we had a random college hookup.
So you just used me for sex ???

246
00:12:56,400 --> 00:12:58,000
Like most guys want? I'm not most guys.

247
00:12:58,000 --> 00:13:01,400
No, you're just most
lawyers. That's not fair.

248
00:13:11,200 --> 00:13:12,400
Hey, ben?

249
00:13:13,200 --> 00:13:15,400
Ben, this is eli. Eli's
a friend of mommy's.

250
00:13:19,700 --> 00:13:21,100
He's not, uh...

251
00:13:22,700 --> 00:13:23,800
i--I'm
not...

252
00:13:24,500 --> 00:13:25,500
yeah...

253
00:13:26,000 --> 00:13:27,800
i was pregnant for 8 years.

254
00:13:31,200 --> 00:13:32,200
Sweetie?

255
00:13:33,500 --> 00:13:35,000
Can you please say hello?

256
00:13:35,700 --> 00:13:36,800
Huh?

257
00:13:43,500 --> 00:13:44,900
So you like blocks, huh?

258
00:13:44,900 --> 00:13:49,000
Words. There's over 500,000
in the english language.

259
00:13:50,300 --> 00:13:51,500
Wow, that's a lot.

260
00:13:51,800 --> 00:13:53,600
They should collect them
all in a book or something.

261
00:13:53,700 --> 00:13:57,200
<i>That's not counting names.
I'm counting them with names.</i>

262
00:13:59,000 --> 00:13:59,600
Oh.

263
00:14:05,500 --> 00:14:06,700
(Beth) what is it, eli?

264
00:14:11,100 --> 00:14:13,600
Uh, come by my office tomorrow at 10:00.

265
00:14:14,900 --> 00:14:17,000
Wh--You're gonna
take the case?

266
00:14:17,000 --> 00:14:18,100
No, i'm gonna be getting fired

267
00:14:18,100 --> 00:14:21,200
'Cause i'm gonna request to
take the case. Oh, look,???

268
00:14:21,200 --> 00:14:24,600
But not if it's out of pity or
sympathy. It's--It's not sympathy.

269
00:14:25,000 --> 00:14:28,700
Uh, there's over 500,000 words
in the english language, and...

270
00:14:29,400 --> 00:14:31,000
that's not counting names.

271
00:14:47,710 --> 00:14:50,760
George michael

272
00:14:58,050 --> 00:15:00,340
Bear with me, mr. Stone.
I don't understand.

273
00:15:00,350 --> 00:15:02,500
Is there some kind of
problem with the case?

274
00:15:03,250 --> 00:15:04,750
No, the case is going great.

275
00:15:04,950 --> 00:15:07,650
The sole exception being
that you wish to switch sides.

276
00:15:09,150 --> 00:15:10,950
W-We represent clients
with conflicting interests

277
00:15:10,950 --> 00:15:11,650
All the time.

278
00:15:11,650 --> 00:15:15,449
Is that the japanese wall you
were talking about? It's chinese.

279
00:15:15,450 --> 00:15:18,650
Whichever. In those
situations, the clients can pay.

280
00:15:22,450 --> 00:15:24,550
<i>(Dinging stops) mr. Stone, are you okay?</i>

281
00:15:26,150 --> 00:15:27,150
I'm fine.

282
00:15:27,650 --> 00:15:28,750
Totally fine.

283
00:15:29,350 --> 00:15:31,250
Mr. Dowd, you're atypicay quiet. Yeah.

284
00:15:31,250 --> 00:15:34,150
Sorry, i was just redecorating
stone's office in my head.

285
00:15:34,350 --> 00:15:36,650
Ordinarily, we offer quixotic plaintiffs

286
00:15:36,650 --> 00:15:38,550
Nuisance value to go away.

287
00:15:38,750 --> 00:15:42,250
We did. Stone upped
the offer to $90,000.

288
00:15:42,250 --> 00:15:45,050
$100,000, actually.
She came by my office.

289
00:15:45,550 --> 00:15:46,850
Let me see if i'm understanding this.

290
00:15:46,850 --> 00:15:49,450
You had an ex parte
conversation with the plaintiff?

291
00:15:49,850 --> 00:15:51,350
Uhwell, it wouldn't be ex parte

292
00:15:51,350 --> 00:15:53,950
If you let me represent her... sir.

293
00:15:54,150 --> 00:15:55,450
Explain to me, mr. Stone,

294
00:15:55,550 --> 00:15:58,850
The rationale for upsettg a
client of beutel's magnitude

295
00:15:58,950 --> 00:16:01,750
On a case which is a
complete and utter loser?

296
00:16:02,850 --> 00:16:03,850
Well, because, sir...

297
00:16:05,550 --> 00:16:06,850
it'll make us rich.

298
00:16:09,650 --> 00:16:10,650
More rich.

299
00:16:12,150 --> 00:16:14,650
We all know that pro bono
work is good for business,

300
00:16:14,650 --> 00:16:15,950
And this case,

301
00:16:15,950 --> 00:16:17,550
As you so correctly
pointed out, mr. Wethersby,

302
00:16:17,550 --> 00:16:20,150
Is a complete and utter loser.

303
00:16:20,750 --> 00:16:22,850
Therefore, the firm
can reap the financial

304
00:16:22,850 --> 00:16:24,550
And the public relations windfalls

305
00:16:24,550 --> 00:16:26,550
Without putting our bottom line at risk.

306
00:16:28,850 --> 00:16:29,650
What is this i hea

307
00:16:29,650 --> 00:16:31,550
About the seven horsemen
of the apocalypse

308
00:16:31,550 --> 00:16:34,850
Actually letting you represent
that woman? Her name's beth.

309
00:16:35,450 --> 00:16:37,150
Now ask dan to get me
points and authorities

310
00:16:37,150 --> 00:16:39,250
<i>On chinese walls, and... (bell dinging)</i>

311
00:16:39,950 --> 00:16:41,750
There it is again. You hear that?

312
00:16:43,250 --> 00:16:44,350
Who was it this time, hmm?

313
00:16:44,350 --> 00:16:48,650
Cyndi lauper? Billy joel? The
go-Go's? It's not music. It's, uh...

314
00:16:48,850 --> 00:16:52,150
like a bell, a dinging. Did you
possibly fall down a flight of stairs,

315
00:16:52,150 --> 00:16:53,350
Or did you start taking ecstasy?

316
00:16:53,350 --> 00:16:55,250
Maybe you fell down a flight
of stairs because you are

317
00:16:55,250 --> 00:16:57,150
High on ecstasy. Wh... (exhales deeply)

318
00:17:00,650 --> 00:17:01,550
(Cable car approaches) hold on!

319
00:17:02,450 --> 00:17:03,650
(Man) all aboard! Hold on!

320
00:17:04,450 --> 00:17:06,150
Let him on.

321
00:17:10,550 --> 00:17:12,350
(Man) come on, eli! Hurry up!

322
00:17:14,050 --> 00:17:14,950
Come on, eli!

323
00:17:28,450 --> 00:17:30,450
There was a voice this time.

324
00:17:30,450 --> 00:17:31,850
I'm pretty sure it was my dead father.

325
00:17:31,950 --> 00:17:34,350
Hmm. Dead parent. Different needle.

326
00:17:35,250 --> 00:17:36,350
You don't understand.

327
00:17:36,350 --> 00:17:37,650
My fatr was an aimless drunk

328
00:17:37,650 --> 00:17:38,850
Who ruined everything he ever toucd.

329
00:17:38,850 --> 00:17:39,950
He's, like, the last perso

330
00:17:39,950 --> 00:17:41,450
I need to be hearing from right now.

331
00:17:41,450 --> 00:17:47,150
No good hate dead people.
Relah. Think good memory father.

332
00:17:48,150 --> 00:17:50,750
Dr. Chen help ungrateful son.

333
00:17:53,650 --> 00:17:54,650
(Man) come on, eli!

334
00:17:55,850 --> 00:17:56,750
Hurry up!

335
00:18:05,450 --> 00:18:07,150
Hey, your mom told me
about your debate trophy.

336
00:18:08,150 --> 00:18:09,250
Sorry i couldn't be there.

337
00:18:09,850 --> 00:18:11,350
Because you were drunk again.

338
00:18:15,750 --> 00:18:16,750
Here.

339
00:18:18,550 --> 00:18:20,350
A celebration present for
winning the tournament.

340
00:18:21,450 --> 00:18:23,550
It's the panch chuli
peaks. They're in india.

341
00:18:24,650 --> 00:18:26,150
I always wanted to see them.

342
00:18:27,550 --> 00:18:28,650
We'll go some day.

343
00:18:29,950 --> 00:18:31,150
"For eli,

344
00:18:31,450 --> 00:18:33,050
So you'll remember."

345
00:18:33,950 --> 00:18:34,950
Remember what?

346
00:18:34,950 --> 00:18:36,550
That you're meant to do great things,

347
00:18:36,550 --> 00:18:39,350
That you're gonna go
to beautiful places,

348
00:18:40,350 --> 00:18:41,550
Speak inspired words,

349
00:18:41,550 --> 00:18:43,350
That you're gonna help people.

350
00:18:48,650 --> 00:18:49,550
Dad, you okay?

351
00:18:52,450 --> 00:18:53,250
Yeah.

352
00:18:53,750 --> 00:18:55,450
(Laughs) yeah. Sure, kiddo.

353
00:18:55,550 --> 00:18:58,750
Hey, uh, there's one more
stop i gotta make, actually.

354
00:18:59,050 --> 00:19:00,550
Tell your mother i'll
be home in a little bit.

355
00:19:11,710 --> 00:19:15,110
??? He barely ever cried or got fussy.

356
00:19:15,610 --> 00:19:18,110
Picked himself up at 10
months and walked at 12.

357
00:19:18,110 --> 00:19:21,510
But at 23 months,
everything changed--

358
00:19:21,510 --> 00:19:23,710
Right after i took him
in for his 2-Year checkup

359
00:19:23,710 --> 00:19:25,110
And his pediatrician gave him

360
00:19:25,110 --> 00:19:26,910
A beutel pharmaceutical flu shot.

361
00:19:27,210 --> 00:19:29,710
Within a week, he was a
totally different child.

362
00:19:29,710 --> 00:19:32,110
He went from smiling all
the time to not at all.

363
00:19:33,110 --> 00:19:35,610
He used to run around the
house like a live wire,

364
00:19:35,610 --> 00:19:39,110
And now his idea of playtime
is stacking objects in rows.

365
00:19:39,110 --> 00:19:43,210
And when he calls for me,
which he hardly ever does...

366
00:19:43,810 --> 00:19:44,810
(voice breaks) he calls me beth.

367
00:19:44,810 --> 00:19:48,510
Uh, your honor... "he calls me beth"?

368
00:19:49,010 --> 00:19:50,510
Mr. Stone, please approach.

369
00:19:54,210 --> 00:19:55,310
Are you mr. Stone?

370
00:19:55,310 --> 00:19:56,910
I figured i could hear this.

371
00:19:57,510 --> 00:19:58,910
An overestimation on my part.

372
00:19:59,510 --> 00:20:01,710
Now i'm... walking away.

373
00:20:03,050 --> 00:20:03,750
Your honor,

374
00:20:03,750 --> 00:20:05,950
We both know t only chance
i have is for the jurors

375
00:20:05,950 --> 00:20:09,350
To identify with my client on an
emotional level. Not my problem.

376
00:20:09,550 --> 00:20:12,050
My decision to let you represent
the kellers in the first place

377
00:20:12,050 --> 00:20:14,150
Should've come wrapped in
a box with a ribbon on it.

378
00:20:14,150 --> 00:20:15,950
Do you understand?
You're drawing an analogy

379
00:20:15,950 --> 00:20:17,950
Between your decision
and a gift, your honor.

380
00:20:19,550 --> 00:20:21,050
<i>And now i'm walking away.</i>

381
00:20:22,350 --> 00:20:23,550
But, ms. Keller,

382
00:20:23,550 --> 00:20:27,050
Isn't a leap to blame a
vaccine for ben's autism?

383
00:20:27,750 --> 00:20:29,650
That vaccine changed my son.

384
00:20:30,250 --> 00:20:31,850
One week, he was happy and healthy,

385
00:20:32,050 --> 00:20:34,350
And the next week, he was autistic.

386
00:20:34,650 --> 00:20:37,950
<i>What kind of c.E.O. Would i be--
What kind of human would i be--</i>

387
00:20:37,950 --> 00:20:39,350
If i allowed my mpany

388
00:20:39,350 --> 00:20:42,250
To use a preservative in its
vaccine that caused autism?

389
00:20:42,250 --> 00:20:44,150
Well, why not just get
rid of the preservative

390
00:20:44,250 --> 00:20:45,350
Just to be sure?

391
00:20:45,450 --> 00:20:47,150
Because then i couldn't
market the vaccine

392
00:20:47,150 --> 00:20:50,950
At an affordable cost.
Look, i'm a parent myself.

393
00:20:50,950 --> 00:20:53,450
And believe me, no level
of risk is acceptable.

394
00:20:53,450 --> 00:20:55,650
<i>But there is no risk
because there's no connection</i>

395
00:20:55,650 --> 00:20:57,550
Which between mercuritol and autism.

396
00:20:57,550 --> 00:20:58,250
Beth keller said

397
00:20:58,250 --> 00:21:01,650
Her son became autistic one
week after exposure to it.

398
00:21:01,950 --> 00:21:04,750
The truth is, no one
knows what causes autism.

399
00:21:05,850 --> 00:21:07,550
???

400
00:21:07,550 --> 00:21:09,950
Ms. Keller has blamed
my company and a product

401
00:21:10,150 --> 00:21:13,550
That has saved the lives of
tens of thousands of children.

402
00:21:14,650 --> 00:21:16,150
We're gonna lose, aren't we?

403
00:21:16,850 --> 00:21:18,850
I'm sorry if by
repeatedly telling you how

404
00:21:18,850 --> 00:21:21,250
We have no chance of
winning i got your hopes up.

405
00:21:21,950 --> 00:21:23,250
Maybe sean was right.

406
00:21:24,450 --> 00:21:26,450
My ex--He said all
the money in the world

407
00:21:26,450 --> 00:21:27,850
Wasn't gonna make ben better,

408
00:21:27,850 --> 00:21:30,150
That i was obsessed
with our son's illness

409
00:21:30,150 --> 00:21:33,150
And i should give up. Is
that why you guys split?

410
00:21:33,350 --> 00:21:35,350
Ours wasn't a ad-Bearing
marriage to begin with.

411
00:21:35,350 --> 00:21:38,950
But after ben was diagnosed,
there was just no way.

412
00:21:39,850 --> 00:21:41,650
(Clears throat) i hope
i'm interrupting something.

413
00:21:41,850 --> 00:21:43,450
We'd better get going. Come on, ben.

414
00:21:49,650 --> 00:21:51,050
What a nice woman.

415
00:21:51,650 --> 00:21:53,750
Cute, too. Is she available?

416
00:21:53,750 --> 00:21:55,150
I'm ignoring you. (Clears throat)

417
00:21:56,350 --> 00:21:58,750
What's that? A "please
break off your engagement,

418
00:21:58,750 --> 00:22:01,750
I'm begging you" present. It's
an internal beutel document.

419
00:22:01,750 --> 00:22:03,750
Gee, thanks, patti. You shouldn't have.

420
00:22:05,050 --> 00:22:06,650
"...Suggests a possible correlation

421
00:22:06,650 --> 00:22:08,950
"Betweenercuritol and
cognitive dysfunction,

422
00:22:09,350 --> 00:22:10,550
Including autism."

423
00:22:11,450 --> 00:22:12,550
Th is a study.

424
00:22:12,750 --> 00:22:16,050
Proving even they thought
mercuritol might be dangerous.

425
00:22:16,250 --> 00:22:17,150
Patti, where'd y get this?

426
00:22:17,150 --> 00:22:18,850
A paralegal who works with matt dowd.

427
00:22:18,850 --> 00:22:21,850
I lent her my tampons when she ran out.

428
00:22:21,850 --> 00:22:22,950
First, ew.

429
00:22:23,050 --> 00:22:25,350
And second, do you have
any idea what you've done?

430
00:22:25,350 --> 00:22:27,250
This--This document's
attorney-Client privilege.

431
00:22:27,450 --> 00:22:29,950
I can't use it. I can't
even know about it.

432
00:22:30,050 --> 00:22:32,350
I could get fired and
disbarred and killed,

433
00:22:32,350 --> 00:22:34,650
And not even in that order.
Don't whisper-Yell at me.

434
00:22:34,650 --> 00:22:35,850
Well, don't try to get me fired.

435
00:22:35,850 --> 00:22:38,850
Well, you're the genius
with the stanford diploma.

436
00:22:39,150 --> 00:22:41,950
Figure something out. God!

437
00:22:45,850 --> 00:22:50,850
So his father d i went
outside to find eli...

438
00:22:51,150 --> 00:22:55,150
naked, covered in feathers
and chocolate syrup.

439
00:22:55,650 --> 00:22:57,650
Thanks, mom. And thank you, too.

440
00:22:57,750 --> 00:22:58,950
Oh, come on. I was 10.

441
00:22:59,150 --> 00:23:00,650
Just be glad i couldn't find tar.

442
00:23:03,350 --> 00:23:05,150
(Doorbell rings) that
would be my parents.

443
00:23:05,150 --> 00:23:06,150
Ah! Mm-Hmm.

444
00:23:10,950 --> 00:23:11,750
Eli.

445
00:23:12,050 --> 00:23:12,950
Hi. Mmm.

446
00:23:14,150 --> 00:23:17,150
Eli mr. Wethersby--
Um... jordan.

447
00:23:17,350 --> 00:23:17,850
(Chuckles) (woman) sweetheart. Mwah.

448
00:23:18,650 --> 00:23:19,150
(Taylor) mwah. Your
place is just darling.

449
00:23:21,550 --> 00:23:23,250
Hello, princess. Hey, daddy.

450
00:23:23,550 --> 00:23:26,550
Hello. Mmm. Mwah.

451
00:23:40,850 --> 00:23:42,050
You're a brave man, eli.

452
00:23:43,550 --> 00:23:45,150
For getting engaged
to the boss' daughter?

453
00:23:45,450 --> 00:23:47,050
That's not bravery. That's stupidity.

454
00:23:48,050 --> 00:23:50,050
I meant taking on the beutel matter.

455
00:23:51,350 --> 00:23:52,450
I would have to agree,

456
00:23:52,650 --> 00:23:53,950
Particularly since beutel's lawyers

457
00:23:53,950 --> 00:23:55,550
Have been dealing from
the bottom of the deck.

458
00:23:55,950 --> 00:23:57,350
If you're referring to the beutel study,

459
00:23:57,350 --> 00:23:59,650
Which i suspect you are, be careful.

460
00:24:00,250 --> 00:24:01,450
It's an ethical violation

461
00:24:01,650 --> 00:24:04,250
For you to be in possession
of it. Well, it was a violation

462
00:24:04,250 --> 00:24:05,750
For you not to produce
it in the first place,

463
00:24:05,750 --> 00:24:07,650
So i guess that makes us even.

464
00:24:08,150 --> 00:24:10,150
In point of fact, i
didn't have to produce it.

465
00:24:11,250 --> 00:24:13,550
At least, not after one of
my associates stepped forward

466
00:24:13,550 --> 00:24:14,850
To take the plaintiff's case,

467
00:24:15,150 --> 00:24:17,150
Effectively allowing
me to seal it behind--

468
00:24:17,650 --> 00:24:20,550
What's it called again? A chinese wall?

469
00:24:21,650 --> 00:24:23,650
In any case, that's why
i'll be in court tomorrow.

470
00:24:26,450 --> 00:24:28,450
Congratulations on the engagement.

471
00:24:29,450 --> 00:24:31,150
It'll be a pleasure to
have you in the family.

472
00:25:09,850 --> 00:25:11,050
<i>(In taylor's voice) eli, stop!</i>

473
00:25:11,250 --> 00:25:12,850
<i>(In nathan's voice) don't! Don't jump!</i>

474
00:25:12,850 --> 00:25:14,050
<i>Please, eli!</i>

475
00:25:15,050 --> 00:25:15,950
<i>Don't jump!</i>

476
00:25:15,950 --> 00:25:17,850
Look at me! Look at me! Listen!

477
00:25:17,850 --> 00:25:20,550
Just come down, please!
What are you doing?! Please!

478
00:25:20,550 --> 00:25:22,950
Look at me! Listen to me!
Get off. Step down. Step down

479
00:25:22,950 --> 00:25:24,750
Please, eli! Come down! Don't!

480
00:25:36,690 --> 00:25:38,590
You did last night, i
realized that i had, uh,

481
00:25:38,590 --> 00:25:40,890
I had seen that kind of behavior before.

482
00:25:40,890 --> 00:25:41,690
We both have...

483
00:25:43,090 --> 00:25:45,690
with dad--Hallucinations,
seeing people,

484
00:25:45,690 --> 00:25:46,790
Hearing things that aren't there.

485
00:25:46,790 --> 00:25:50,290
Just stop me when this doesn't
sound familiar. I don't understand.

486
00:25:50,290 --> 00:25:51,890
What does this all have
to do with your father?

487
00:25:51,890 --> 00:25:54,390
Well, i'd always associated
his episodes with alcohol,

488
00:25:54,490 --> 00:25:55,890
But it seems pretty clear

489
00:25:55,890 --> 00:25:57,990
That he was suffering
from something else.

490
00:25:57,990 --> 00:25:59,990
There was just no way
of knowing it back then.

491
00:26:00,890 --> 00:26:03,090
I took your m.R.I. To
our neurology chief,

492
00:26:03,590 --> 00:26:04,690
And, um...

493
00:26:06,490 --> 00:26:07,890
he found something. (Typing on keyboard)

494
00:26:08,090 --> 00:26:09,090
He found what?

495
00:26:11,990 --> 00:26:13,190
A brain aneurysm.

496
00:26:13,690 --> 00:26:16,290
It's about, uh, 3 millimeters in size.

497
00:26:16,290 --> 00:26:18,390
We wouldn't have found it
unless we knew what to look for.

498
00:26:18,690 --> 00:26:21,490
Now intracranial aneurysms
can be hereditary.

499
00:26:21,890 --> 00:26:24,890
It is not uncommon for them to
afflict the same of the brain

500
00:26:24,890 --> 00:26:26,090
In a parent and a child.

501
00:26:26,090 --> 00:26:29,690
And in this case, it is in
the right cerebral artery.

502
00:26:29,690 --> 00:26:31,690
Any disruption of
blood flow in this area

503
00:26:31,690 --> 00:26:34,090
Would account for, uh,

504
00:26:34,090 --> 00:26:37,290
Delusions of grandeur or hallucinations.

505
00:26:37,390 --> 00:26:38,190
Uh...

506
00:26:40,890 --> 00:26:42,290
wh-When do you take it out?

507
00:26:42,690 --> 00:26:46,190
Because it is located
so deep in the cortex,

508
00:26:46,190 --> 00:26:47,690
According to the...

509
00:26:48,790 --> 00:26:49,790
chief neurosurgeon,

510
00:26:49,790 --> 00:26:52,590
It is not amenable to
surgical intervention.

511
00:27:00,950 --> 00:27:02,250
What if it bursts?

512
00:27:03,050 --> 00:27:04,450
It might not.

513
00:27:04,950 --> 00:27:05,550
No, a lot of people

514
00:27:05,550 --> 00:27:07,750
Live their whole lives with aneurysms,

515
00:27:07,750 --> 00:27:10,150
And then they die
of perfectly bor--

516
00:27:11,450 --> 00:27:13,050
(Voice breaks) perfectly boring things.

517
00:27:13,850 --> 00:27:15,450
I'm so sorry, eli.

518
00:27:19,550 --> 00:27:21,050
I'll let you two talk.

519
00:27:30,950 --> 00:27:33,150
Well, we should probably
move the wedding up.

520
00:27:34,150 --> 00:27:35,150
That's not funny.

521
00:27:38,650 --> 00:27:40,750
I don't know if i can do this, eli.

522
00:27:41,750 --> 00:27:43,650
You know, visions,
the odd behavior--

523
00:27:43,650 --> 00:27:44,950
I could take all that.

524
00:27:46,850 --> 00:27:48,809
The idea of losing you at any moment...

525
00:27:48,837 --> 00:27:50,837
are--Are you
breaking up with me?

526
00:27:52,437 --> 00:27:56,037
'Cause i-I was just diagnosed
with a brain aneurysm,

527
00:27:56,037 --> 00:27:58,437
And that would be really
bad timing on your part.

528
00:27:58,837 --> 00:28:01,437
I am just trying to process all of this.

529
00:28:01,637 --> 00:28:02,737
(Whispers) okay.

530
00:28:04,637 --> 00:28:06,037
Eli, where are you going?

531
00:28:06,037 --> 00:28:07,737
I'm late for court.

532
00:28:14,137 --> 00:28:16,337
The plaintiff recalls alan cooke.

533
00:28:23,337 --> 00:28:24,937
What's your child's name, sir?

534
00:28:24,937 --> 00:28:27,537
Objection. Earlier, mr. Cooke
mentioned having a child.

535
00:28:27,537 --> 00:28:30,637
He oped the door. Overruled.

536
00:28:32,137 --> 00:28:33,937
Your child's name, sir? Jenna.

537
00:28:34,337 --> 00:28:37,637
Did jenna ever receive a flu
vaccine? Several, i'm sure.

538
00:28:37,637 --> 00:28:40,537
Were any of them manufactured
by beutel pharmaceuticals?

539
00:28:40,537 --> 00:28:41,737
Objection! Objection!

540
00:28:42,037 --> 00:28:44,337
Hell, no. Now we're gettin' somewhere.

541
00:28:46,937 --> 00:28:48,137
Well, mr. Cooke?

542
00:28:48,437 --> 00:28:50,837
I believe the choice of vaccine

543
00:28:50,837 --> 00:28:52,637
Was jenna's pediatrician's decision.

544
00:28:58,137 --> 00:29:00,337
Mr. Cooke, do you recognize
the man in the glasses

545
00:29:00,337 --> 00:29:02,737
Who just entered the room?

546
00:29:04,437 --> 00:29:06,837
That's dr. Varga, jenna's pediatrician.

547
00:29:07,637 --> 00:29:09,837
Or as i prefer to call
him, my next witness.

548
00:29:11,537 --> 00:29:13,937
Now i'm going to ask you
one more time, mr. Cooke.

549
00:29:13,937 --> 00:29:15,337
To the best of your knowledge,

550
00:29:16,437 --> 00:29:18,537
Did jenna ever receive a beutel vaccine?

551
00:29:19,837 --> 00:29:21,837
No, she did not.

552
00:29:23,237 --> 00:29:25,237
Was that at your request, sir?

553
00:29:25,737 --> 00:29:28,237
Yes. It was.

554
00:29:31,037 --> 00:29:33,737
We're prepared to offer $360,000.

555
00:29:34,937 --> 00:29:35,937
Sealed.

556
00:29:36,237 --> 00:29:39,437
No admission of liability.
Check by the end of business.

557
00:29:40,737 --> 00:29:41,937
I'm sorry. No.

558
00:29:42,737 --> 00:29:44,837
No what? No, i don't accept.

559
00:29:44,837 --> 00:29:47,037
I want mercuritol taken
out of beutel's vaccines,

560
00:29:47,037 --> 00:29:48,737
And i want them to set up a fund

561
00:29:48,837 --> 00:29:50,537
For any other kids it made autistic.

562
00:29:50,537 --> 00:29:52,337
Could you guys give us a few minutes?

563
00:30:04,037 --> 00:30:06,237
(Door closes) beth, what
i did in there was a stunt.

564
00:30:06,437 --> 00:30:07,337
Matt's gonna go back in,

565
00:30:07,337 --> 00:30:09,137
He's gonna clean up
the mess that i made.

566
00:30:09,137 --> 00:30:10,537
Now we're down to summations here,

567
00:30:10,737 --> 00:30:12,637
And i'd have to give the one of my life

568
00:30:12,637 --> 00:30:15,337
And get struck by lightning
for us to have a chance.

569
00:30:15,337 --> 00:30:17,137
But i'm not gonna take their bribe.

570
00:30:17,137 --> 00:30:19,837
If you don't take the offer,
you're going to nothing.

571
00:30:19,837 --> 00:30:23,037
Nothing. Wow, yeah.
Okay, you--You're right.

572
00:30:23,537 --> 00:30:25,037
We're gonna lose,

573
00:30:25,037 --> 00:30:28,537
But not because of matt dowd
or beutel or burdens of proof.

574
00:30:28,537 --> 00:30:29,537
We are gonna lose

575
00:30:29,537 --> 00:30:31,837
<i>Because when you stand up
to give the closing argument,</i>

576
00:30:31,837 --> 00:30:33,637
The jury's gonna look in your eyes,

577
00:30:33,637 --> 00:30:37,237
And they're gonna see
that you don't believe.

578
00:30:39,237 --> 00:30:40,037
For the first time,

579
00:30:40,037 --> 00:30:42,437
I feel sorrier for you than i do for me.

580
00:30:46,537 --> 00:30:47,637
Come on, ben.

581
00:31:06,337 --> 00:31:08,337
You always show up no appointment.

582
00:31:08,337 --> 00:31:10,937
Dr. Chen not jiffy
lube. Come back friday.

583
00:31:10,937 --> 00:31:12,637
I went to the
doctor-- The real kind.

584
00:31:13,637 --> 00:31:15,537
You wouldn't, uh, happen
to have any needles

585
00:31:15,537 --> 00:31:17,037
For an inoperable brain aneurysm

586
00:31:17,037 --> 00:31:18,837
I inherited from my alcoholic father

587
00:31:18,837 --> 00:31:20,837
Who i've wrongly hated for 20 years?

588
00:31:23,537 --> 00:31:25,737
(American accent) oh, wow.
That totally blows, bro.

589
00:31:26,537 --> 00:31:27,637
What happened to your accent?

590
00:31:28,037 --> 00:31:30,737
Long story. Want a beer?

591
00:31:33,937 --> 00:31:35,037
I grew up on a commune.

592
00:31:35,337 --> 00:31:38,437
From there, u.C.
Berkeley-- Philosophy major.

593
00:31:39,337 --> 00:31:41,237
There's no future in
existentialist ethics,

594
00:31:41,237 --> 00:31:43,337
So i got into acupuncture.

595
00:31:43,537 --> 00:31:44,537
Unfortunately, nobody wants

596
00:31:44,537 --> 00:31:46,737
An acupuncturist named frank lebakowski.

597
00:31:47,337 --> 00:31:50,137
They want incense,
mystique, a foreign accent.

598
00:31:50,137 --> 00:31:52,137
Yeah, they want the dr. Chen.

599
00:31:52,237 --> 00:31:54,737
That's great--Even my
treatments were imaginary.

600
00:31:54,737 --> 00:31:56,937
Hey, eight years of coursework
in holistic medicine,

601
00:31:56,937 --> 00:31:58,237
Two years in beijing.

602
00:31:58,237 --> 00:31:59,137
Give me some props.

603
00:31:59,637 --> 00:32:03,237
Now tell me about this latest
vision. Ah, it's just pointless.

604
00:32:03,237 --> 00:32:05,637
It's all just my defective
brain playing tricks on me.

605
00:32:05,637 --> 00:32:08,037
Everything has two
explanations, eli--

606
00:32:08,137 --> 00:32:09,737
The scientific and the divine.

607
00:32:10,137 --> 00:32:12,137
It's up to us to choose
which one we buy into.

608
00:32:12,337 --> 00:32:13,337
Now science explains

609
00:32:13,337 --> 00:32:14,737
The enlarged vessel in your head.

610
00:32:15,137 --> 00:32:17,737
But does it explain how the
girl you lost your virginity to

611
00:32:17,737 --> 00:32:19,237
Happened to be suing your law firm?

612
00:32:19,537 --> 00:32:21,737
How her son happen to
spell out a message to you

613
00:32:21,737 --> 00:32:25,537
With his blocks? Okay, so what would your
divine explanation for all of this be?

614
00:32:26,037 --> 00:32:27,637
Almost all religions believe that

615
00:32:27,637 --> 00:32:30,237
There are those who are sent
to us to help us find our way.

616
00:32:31,137 --> 00:32:32,337
Some people call them prophets.

617
00:32:33,237 --> 00:32:35,937
A prophet. You think i'm a prophet?

618
00:32:37,437 --> 00:32:38,537
Like moses?

619
00:32:39,237 --> 00:32:42,137
God told moses he'd send a
prophet to every generation.

620
00:32:43,237 --> 00:32:45,237
Why not a lawyer-- A
high profile attorney

621
00:32:45,237 --> 00:32:47,237
Handling cases that
got a lot of notoriety,

622
00:32:47,237 --> 00:32:48,637
That the world would read about?

623
00:32:48,737 --> 00:32:50,537
The difference between those guys and me

624
00:32:50,537 --> 00:32:53,537
Is i don't believe in god.

625
00:32:53,737 --> 00:32:54,837
Sure you do.

626
00:32:54,837 --> 00:32:56,437
You believe in right and wrong.

627
00:32:56,937 --> 00:32:59,337
You believe in justice, in fairness.

628
00:33:00,437 --> 00:33:01,937
And you believe in love.

629
00:33:02,737 --> 00:33:04,837
All those things--
They're god, eli.

630
00:33:07,237 --> 00:33:08,337
<i>And that...</i>

631
00:33:09,937 --> 00:33:11,637
that's god, too.

632
00:33:18,610 --> 00:33:19,510
The first lawsuit

633
00:33:19,510 --> 00:33:21,510
Alleging a connection
between tobacco and cancer

634
00:33:21,510 --> 00:33:23,210
Was filed in 1954.

635
00:33:23,710 --> 00:33:27,210
But it took 30 years for a
jury to award a single dollar

636
00:33:27,210 --> 00:33:29,910
For something we now all
accept as patently true.

637
00:33:30,310 --> 00:33:33,110
Is there proof mercuritol
causes autism? Yes.

638
00:33:34,310 --> 00:33:37,110
Is that proof direct or
incontrovertible proof? No.

639
00:33:37,710 --> 00:33:38,610
But ask yourself

640
00:33:38,610 --> 00:33:40,510
If you've ever believed
in anything, in anyone,

641
00:33:40,510 --> 00:33:42,810
Without absolute proof.

642
00:33:43,510 --> 00:33:45,910
That's called faith,
ladies and gentlemen.

643
00:33:45,910 --> 00:33:46,910
And make no mistake,

644
00:33:46,910 --> 00:33:49,110
This is very much a case about faith.

645
00:33:51,710 --> 00:33:53,410
It's about beth keller's faith.

646
00:33:54,010 --> 00:33:57,410
She placed her faith in beutel
when she exposed her child

647
00:33:57,410 --> 00:34:00,410
To a vaccine mr. Cooke
wouldn't give his own daughter.

648
00:34:00,710 --> 00:34:02,310
She placed her faith
in the justice system

649
00:34:02,310 --> 00:34:03,810
To hold beutel accountable,

650
00:34:03,810 --> 00:34:05,010
And now she's here,

651
00:34:05,010 --> 00:34:06,910
Putting that same unshakable faith

652
00:34:07,110 --> 00:34:08,610
In the 12 of you.

653
00:34:09,910 --> 00:34:11,810
I don't have beth keller's faith,

654
00:34:12,410 --> 00:34:14,210
But i do believe in some things.

655
00:34:15,610 --> 00:34:16,810
I believe in people.

656
00:34:18,110 --> 00:34:20,010
That's why i became a lawyer.

657
00:34:21,110 --> 00:34:24,610
I believe that most people
wanna do what's right.

658
00:34:25,210 --> 00:34:27,710
And the right thing to do here

659
00:34:27,710 --> 00:34:31,110
Is to remove mercuritol
from beutel's vaccines.

660
00:34:31,910 --> 00:34:34,010
Unfortunately,our verdict...

661
00:34:35,010 --> 00:34:37,110
can't order them to do that.

662
00:34:38,810 --> 00:34:40,010
<i>What you can do</i>

663
00:34:41,110 --> 00:34:44,010
Is award beth keller a judgment so high

664
00:34:44,510 --> 00:34:47,210
That beutel feels it
has no other choice.

665
00:34:49,010 --> 00:34:50,010
Sadly,

666
00:34:50,510 --> 00:34:52,610
Without that verdict, i...

667
00:34:53,110 --> 00:34:56,110
<i>don't have faith that
beutel will do what's right.</i>

668
00:35:00,910 --> 00:35:02,610
But i have faith that you will.

669
00:35:10,010 --> 00:35:11,010
How much longer?

670
00:35:13,110 --> 00:35:15,810
Uh, juries don't award millions
of dollars in five minutes.

671
00:35:15,810 --> 00:35:17,810
So for us, it's the longer the better.

672
00:35:20,410 --> 00:35:21,610
(Pat) eli.

673
00:35:24,610 --> 00:35:26,610
Someone came by the office.

674
00:35:30,110 --> 00:35:31,010
Mom.

675
00:35:31,310 --> 00:35:35,310
Your brother told me
everything. Oh, i'm so sorry.

676
00:35:36,210 --> 00:35:37,210
Are you all ght?

677
00:35:37,210 --> 00:35:38,410
I'm fine. Yeah?

678
00:35:38,410 --> 00:35:41,910
Yeah. Apart from the,
you know, aneurysm. Oh.

679
00:35:43,910 --> 00:35:44,710
Oh.

680
00:35:47,510 --> 00:35:48,810
I had no idea.

681
00:35:49,510 --> 00:35:50,510
It's horrible to think
how much of my life

682
00:35:51,410 --> 00:35:52,710
I've spent blaming your father

683
00:35:52,710 --> 00:35:55,610
For something that wasn't
his fault. Yeah, me, too.

684
00:35:56,310 --> 00:35:58,210
It sure helps to explain a lot.

685
00:36:01,410 --> 00:36:04,010
That's the coffee can!
Where did you get that?

686
00:36:04,010 --> 00:36:06,810
It's your father. It's his ashes.

687
00:36:08,310 --> 00:36:09,810
You kept dad in a coffee can?

688
00:36:10,610 --> 00:36:11,510
No, of course not.

689
00:36:11,510 --> 00:36:13,710
I transported him in the coffee can.

690
00:36:13,810 --> 00:36:14,210
I didn't want

691
00:36:14,210 --> 00:36:16,810
To traipse a 10-Pound
china urn across town.

692
00:36:17,910 --> 00:36:19,010
Honey,

693
00:36:20,110 --> 00:36:22,510
He wanted you to have this...

694
00:36:23,210 --> 00:36:24,310
him.

695
00:36:24,310 --> 00:36:25,410
In his will,

696
00:36:25,510 --> 00:36:28,010
He expressed a desire to be cremated.

697
00:36:28,910 --> 00:36:30,410
He wanted you to have the ashes.

698
00:36:30,410 --> 00:36:34,310
He said that one day, you
would know what to do with them.

699
00:36:34,310 --> 00:36:37,110
Of course, i thought that was
the request of a crazy person,

700
00:36:37,110 --> 00:36:39,010
And i didn't want to burden you.

701
00:36:39,610 --> 00:36:41,010
But now...

702
00:36:42,610 --> 00:36:45,210
i'm hoping you'll know
what to do with them.

703
00:36:47,510 --> 00:36:49,010
I think i do.

704
00:36:50,810 --> 00:36:52,310
Jury's back.

705
00:36:53,910 --> 00:36:55,010
That quick?

706
00:36:55,810 --> 00:36:56,810
Mom, i gotta go.

707
00:36:56,810 --> 00:36:59,010
(Whispers) it's okay.
It's okay. It's okay.

708
00:36:59,210 --> 00:37:01,410
I love you. Okay.

709
00:37:04,710 --> 00:37:07,310
Patti, take my dad back to the office.

710
00:37:07,810 --> 00:37:10,710
I am not gonna even
pretend to understand that.

711
00:37:11,710 --> 00:37:12,710
Good luck.

712
00:37:13,210 --> 00:37:14,610
You've never wished me luck before.

713
00:37:14,610 --> 00:37:16,910
I never cared whether you won before.

714
00:37:17,710 --> 00:37:20,310
I--Neither
did i.

715
00:37:22,710 --> 00:37:24,510
Has the jury reached a verdict?

716
00:37:24,810 --> 00:37:26,310
We have, your honor.

717
00:37:27,310 --> 00:37:28,610
<i>In the matter of beth keller</i>

718
00:37:28,610 --> 00:37:31,210
<i>Vs. Beutel pharmaceutical incorporated,</i>

719
00:37:32,010 --> 00:37:34,010
As to the claim of product liability,

720
00:37:34,310 --> 00:37:37,010
We find in favor of the plaintiff...

721
00:37:38,510 --> 00:37:40,410
and order the defendant to pay damages

722
00:37:40,410 --> 00:37:43,910
In the amount of $5.2 million.

723
00:37:46,810 --> 00:37:48,010
You heard that, too, right?

724
00:37:48,010 --> 00:37:49,410
'Cause i've been hearing
some things lately.

725
00:37:49,410 --> 00:37:50,510
No, i heard it.

726
00:37:52,110 --> 00:37:53,850
Okay, we all know what happens next.

727
00:37:53,860 --> 00:37:56,960
We appeal, appeal the appeal,
appeal the appealof the appeal.

728
00:37:56,960 --> 00:37:58,060
Basically, run this thing out

729
00:37:58,060 --> 00:38:00,960
Till little ben's eligible for
social security. That's a nice try,

730
00:38:00,960 --> 00:38:02,760
But beutel can't risk an appeal

731
00:38:02,760 --> 00:38:05,660
Because they can't risk the
publicity. Speak quickly, mr. Stone.

732
00:38:05,760 --> 00:38:08,360
$2 million to the kellers,
the balance of the judgment

733
00:38:08,360 --> 00:38:10,260
Gets invested in a fund
for autistic children,

734
00:38:10,260 --> 00:38:13,060
And mercuritol is removed
from beutel's vaccines,

735
00:38:13,060 --> 00:38:14,260
Effective immediately

736
00:38:17,260 --> 00:38:18,460
Write it up.

737
00:38:20,660 --> 00:38:22,060
Wait, one more thing.

738
00:38:23,760 --> 00:38:25,360
Eli keeps his job.

739
00:38:26,460 --> 00:38:29,360
He just won a multimillion
dollar jury verdict.

740
00:38:29,760 --> 00:38:32,560
We'd be hard-Pressed to
explain letting him go.

741
00:38:32,660 --> 00:38:35,060
???

742
00:38:35,160 --> 00:38:38,260
Shrewd. I'll have mr. Dowd draft it up.

743
00:38:47,560 --> 00:38:49,960
Honestly, i-I don't
know how to thank you.

744
00:38:51,260 --> 00:38:51,960
Well, i think you just did

745
00:38:51,960 --> 00:38:54,060
With the "i keeps his job" bit.

746
00:38:54,260 --> 00:38:57,060
(Scoffs) that was nothing.
You changed our lives.

747
00:38:58,160 --> 00:38:58,660
Well, i think i'm gonna

748
00:38:58,660 --> 00:39:00,860
Be making a few changes to mine, too.

749
00:39:02,560 --> 00:39:05,860
Don't be a stranger,
okay? And thank you.

750
00:39:20,660 --> 00:39:23,960
The man of the hour. It's
all over the courthouse.

751
00:39:23,960 --> 00:39:25,560
What, that i'm back on the market?

752
00:39:29,160 --> 00:39:31,160
It wasn't exactly my finest moment

753
00:39:31,560 --> 00:39:32,860
At the doctor's office.

754
00:39:33,760 --> 00:39:35,360
But i am sorry, eli,

755
00:39:35,360 --> 00:39:37,660
And i love you.

756
00:39:41,460 --> 00:39:42,460
I love you, too,

757
00:39:44,460 --> 00:39:46,160
And i wanna be with you.

758
00:39:47,760 --> 00:39:48,760
But...

759
00:39:48,760 --> 00:39:49,660
but?

760
00:39:49,660 --> 00:39:51,360
I have to go to india.

761
00:39:52,460 --> 00:39:54,160
Right this minute, or...

762
00:39:55,060 --> 00:39:56,360
are you free for lunch?

763
00:40:02,860 --> 00:40:04,160
<i>So that's my story.</i>

764
00:40:04,460 --> 00:40:06,160
<i>It's got sherpas and george michael.</i>

765
00:40:06,360 --> 00:40:07,260
<i>It's got cable cars</i>

766
00:40:07,260 --> 00:40:09,860
<i>And mystical chinese doctors...</i>

767
00:40:09,960 --> 00:40:12,660
<i>who aren't really that mystical
and aren't really that chinese.</i>

768
00:40:12,960 --> 00:40:15,160
<i>I have a feeling that's
just the beginning.</i>

769
00:40:16,260 --> 00:40:16,760
Mom said

770
00:40:16,760 --> 00:40:18,860
You spent your whole
life with these visions.

771
00:40:19,060 --> 00:40:20,460
I had no idea.

772
00:40:23,660 --> 00:40:24,860
I'm soy, dad.

773
00:40:27,460 --> 00:40:28,660
I'm sorry for blaming you

774
00:40:28,660 --> 00:40:30,460
For things that weren't your fault.

775
00:40:31,560 --> 00:40:32,760
Most of all, i'm sorry that

776
00:40:32,760 --> 00:40:35,160
I'm not the person that you said i'd be.

777
00:40:38,160 --> 00:40:39,860
I'm gonna change that.

778
00:40:43,060 --> 00:40:44,560
I promise.

779
00:40:54,360 --> 00:40:55,760
Okay, guys.

780
00:40:57,560 --> 00:40:58,760
Let's go.
