1
00:00:12,712 --> 00:00:16,876
Prologue.

2
00:00:19,586 --> 00:00:21,952
Steady, steady.

3
00:00:22,489 --> 00:00:23,581
Thank you.

4
00:00:31,464 --> 00:00:32,590
There are news.

5
00:00:32,665 --> 00:00:35,566
Picnic is worthless, since
they have their plan.

6
00:00:35,635 --> 00:00:37,569
- What for?
- To ignore us.

7
00:00:37,670 --> 00:00:39,570
They think that we want
to engage them...

8
00:00:39,672 --> 00:00:42,869
and agreed to send us to hell
til we stop our love life.

9
00:00:42,976 --> 00:00:44,967
- I think that is not possible.
- Of course not.

10
00:00:45,078 --> 00:00:46,078
So then?

11
00:00:46,179 --> 00:00:50,013
In spite of their pact, I'm going to
talk to your sister, I'm sure to win.

12
00:00:50,116 --> 00:00:51,640
What's your tactic?

13
00:00:51,751 --> 00:00:54,083
I'll see in time...

14
00:00:54,154 --> 00:00:55,712
And you?

15
00:00:55,789 --> 00:00:57,723
I'll pretend to be
indifferent...

16
00:00:57,791 --> 00:01:00,021
and then I'll propose her
a platonic friendship.

17
00:01:00,126 --> 00:01:02,458
That never fails,
they always fall.

18
00:01:03,263 --> 00:01:05,629
- Well Chayo, are we done?
- Yeah.

19
00:01:05,698 --> 00:01:07,097
Don't change your mind,

20
00:01:07,200 --> 00:01:08,929
- and don't betray.
- Don't worry.

21
00:01:09,002 --> 00:01:09,832
OK, let's go.

22
00:01:09,936 --> 00:01:11,904
Let them find us.

23
00:01:12,806 --> 00:01:14,239
- Hey Pedro.
- What?

24
00:01:14,340 --> 00:01:16,501
I'm taking Rosario fishing
to the fall.

25
00:01:16,576 --> 00:01:18,635
And I'm taking Maruja hunting.

26
00:01:18,711 --> 00:01:19,700
Remember that she's my sister.

27
00:01:19,813 --> 00:01:21,280
Come on, don't you know me?

28
00:01:21,347 --> 00:01:23,838
That's why I say so...

29
00:01:40,500 --> 00:01:48,373
<i>Country smell</i>

30
00:01:48,441 --> 00:01:53,071
<i>that in the trees,</i>

31
00:01:53,146 --> 00:01:57,708
<i>the breeze wraps</i>

32
00:01:57,817 --> 00:02:02,754
<i>with it's song</i>

33
00:02:04,090 --> 00:02:12,090
<i>of a marvelous rythm.</i>

34
00:02:13,466 --> 00:02:18,733
<i>Miraculous God</i>

35
00:02:19,339 --> 00:02:26,643
<i>is going to glow.</i>

36
00:02:26,980 --> 00:02:31,940
<i>The country is a nest</i>

37
00:02:32,018 --> 00:02:37,081
<i>of inexpressible things.</i>

38
00:02:37,190 --> 00:02:41,354
<i>The song of the river</i>

39
00:02:41,461 --> 00:02:46,592
<i>and the cry of the lark.</i>

40
00:02:47,000 --> 00:02:51,403
<i>Mighty torrent</i>

41
00:02:51,471 --> 00:02:56,408
<i>the moonlight kissed me.</i>

42
00:02:56,476 --> 00:03:04,476
<i>Rocking of a cradle on the blue lake.</i>

43
00:03:09,889 --> 00:03:16,351
<i>Country smell</i>

44
00:03:16,429 --> 00:03:20,957
<i>that in the trees</i>

45
00:03:21,034 --> 00:03:25,733
<i>the breeze wraps</i>

46
00:03:25,838 --> 00:03:31,708
<i>with it's song</i>

47
00:03:31,811 --> 00:03:39,013
<i>of a marvelous rythm.</i>

48
00:03:39,118 --> 00:03:44,181
<i>Good God</i>

49
00:03:44,958 --> 00:03:52,958
<i>is going to glow.</i>

50
00:04:08,214 --> 00:04:09,681
Why are you so quiet?

51
00:04:09,749 --> 00:04:11,683
Mmm, ah.

52
00:04:11,751 --> 00:04:13,878
I was just thinking.

53
00:04:14,887 --> 00:04:17,151
Is it something that you're
going to tell me?

54
00:04:17,523 --> 00:04:18,820
Yeah.

55
00:04:18,891 --> 00:04:20,859
Just tell me.

56
00:04:22,462 --> 00:04:25,022
Many times I've been tempted
to ask you to be my girl

57
00:04:25,131 --> 00:04:27,827
but I haven't had the guts.

58
00:04:27,934 --> 00:04:29,902
And now you did.

59
00:04:31,204 --> 00:04:32,603
Now...

60
00:04:32,672 --> 00:04:34,697
I want to tell you...

61
00:04:36,042 --> 00:04:37,942
That I'm glad not
to have done that.

62
00:04:38,544 --> 00:04:39,875
Why?

63
00:04:39,979 --> 00:04:43,210
Because I have reached
the conclusion

64
00:04:43,283 --> 00:04:46,741
that you and I should
be only friends.

65
00:04:46,853 --> 00:04:48,650
That's what we've always
been, haven't we?

66
00:04:48,721 --> 00:04:52,020
Yeah, but we have to glorify
that friendship.

67
00:04:52,125 --> 00:04:53,820
Beleive it or not.

68
00:04:53,926 --> 00:04:56,952
There was a tieme when I dreamed
to hold you in my arms.

69
00:04:57,530 --> 00:04:59,327
To touch your hair.

70
00:04:59,499 --> 00:05:03,560
To see me in your eyes and
to kiss you vigorously.

71
00:05:04,504 --> 00:05:06,665
But you have put it very delicately
that this is not

72
00:05:06,773 --> 00:05:09,241
the kind of love that
you want from me.

73
00:05:09,309 --> 00:05:11,038
Nor I from you.

74
00:05:11,144 --> 00:05:15,672
So you will get married,
maybe will l.

75
00:05:15,782 --> 00:05:17,340
We'll grow old.

76
00:05:17,417 --> 00:05:20,978
And we'll always be
very good friends.

77
00:05:23,656 --> 00:05:26,022
Don't you think it's
a beautiful love?

78
00:05:26,693 --> 00:05:28,923
Yeah, so beautiful.

79
00:05:29,629 --> 00:05:31,995
You have taken the bait!

80
00:05:32,065 --> 00:05:33,430
Why do you say so?

81
00:05:33,499 --> 00:05:35,865
For that little trout. Lend
me the net. Look at it!

82
00:05:36,469 --> 00:05:37,527
Lend me the net!

83
00:05:43,109 --> 00:05:44,371
Have you thought about it?

84
00:05:44,811 --> 00:05:45,811
Yeah!

85
00:05:46,045 --> 00:05:47,410
And what dou you say to me?

86
00:05:47,480 --> 00:05:48,674
No.

87
00:05:49,282 --> 00:05:52,479
Just let me warn you that I'll marry
the first lady that I'll find.

88
00:05:52,685 --> 00:05:55,085
Hey "Perico", don<i>'</i>t
you fright me.

89
00:05:55,655 --> 00:05:57,680
But babe, I can't find
a way to convince you.

90
00:05:57,790 --> 00:05:59,621
It'll be enough to well behave.

91
00:05:59,692 --> 00:06:00,556
And do I behave badly?

92
00:06:00,626 --> 00:06:03,652
No, very good! Deny me that you
are courting the Gutierrez.

93
00:06:03,763 --> 00:06:05,822
Ay, how can you be like that?

94
00:06:05,898 --> 00:06:07,559
The Gutierrez. Anybody who
hears you might thing

95
00:06:07,633 --> 00:06:09,464
that I'm courting the four
of them, only two of them.

96
00:06:09,535 --> 00:06:13,266
The other two are for Jorge, and they're
not any longer, we finished.

97
00:06:13,373 --> 00:06:15,341
And Martha, the telegraphist?

98
00:06:16,008 --> 00:06:19,569
We lasted less than..
An urgent message.

99
00:06:19,645 --> 00:06:22,079
And what about Juanita,
the post office girl?

100
00:06:22,148 --> 00:06:24,639
Maybe a night delivery?

101
00:06:24,717 --> 00:06:27,880
It better was immediate
delivery.

102
00:06:28,054 --> 00:06:31,023
Shameless! And Enriqueta,
the funeral parlor girl?

103
00:06:31,090 --> 00:06:32,318
That one is dead!

104
00:06:32,425 --> 00:06:35,519
Tha's why you attended the service
along with the San Juan district girls.

105
00:06:35,595 --> 00:06:37,062
Here we go again!

106
00:06:37,163 --> 00:06:40,894
Those are only girlies, you
have your right place!

107
00:06:40,967 --> 00:06:45,961
Fortunately. So, the farther
you and I are, the better.

108
00:06:46,339 --> 00:06:48,739
Ay babe!

109
00:06:54,414 --> 00:06:56,075
Hey Jorge.

110
00:06:57,049 --> 00:06:58,689
You have somewhere a
girfriend, don't you?

111
00:07:00,953 --> 00:07:02,250
Admit it!

112
00:07:02,522 --> 00:07:05,116
Didn't we agree to
be great friend?

113
00:07:05,191 --> 00:07:09,252
Friends make confessions
and advice each other...

114
00:07:09,328 --> 00:07:12,229
Come on, tell me, do you
have a girlfriend?

115
00:07:13,099 --> 00:07:14,657
I don't know what to tell you.

116
00:07:14,801 --> 00:07:18,168
But what do you think of Genoveva,
General's daughter?

117
00:07:18,237 --> 00:07:20,171
She's pretty...

118
00:07:20,239 --> 00:07:23,402
She dresses well,
plays the piano...

119
00:07:23,509 --> 00:07:25,477
and is your girlfriend?

120
00:07:25,678 --> 00:07:27,737
Not yet, but I'll talk to her.

121
00:07:27,847 --> 00:07:31,408
Don't talk to her. She's not for
you. You deserve someone better.

122
00:07:33,753 --> 00:07:36,779
Well, that is my opinion.

123
00:07:37,824 --> 00:07:39,815
Now I want to know yours.

124
00:07:40,460 --> 00:07:43,952
What do you think of
Ricardo Del Paso?

125
00:07:44,564 --> 00:07:47,658
He's a great guy, elegant...

126
00:07:47,767 --> 00:07:50,565
formal and speaks english...

127
00:07:50,636 --> 00:07:52,365
and has no love affairs.

128
00:07:52,538 --> 00:07:54,802
Never drinks an he confesses
every Sunday.

129
00:07:54,874 --> 00:07:57,468
And never speak bad words.

130
00:07:57,844 --> 00:07:58,936
He's eligible.

131
00:07:59,045 --> 00:08:01,707
He's bald, but a
wig will make it.

132
00:08:01,814 --> 00:08:04,544
He has no converstion
an he is so stupid.

133
00:08:04,617 --> 00:08:08,053
But stupids are the
best husbands.

134
00:08:08,154 --> 00:08:10,122
So he's for you. When are
you getting married?

135
00:08:10,223 --> 00:08:11,485
Do you want me to
be your best man?

136
00:08:11,591 --> 00:08:13,149
Go to hell with your friendship.

137
00:08:13,259 --> 00:08:17,719
Friends... What happens is that you're
in love, so you don't need me...

138
00:08:17,797 --> 00:08:22,427
- But Rosario.
- You loved me a lot. Don't deny it.

139
00:08:24,136 --> 00:08:25,694
So what about Ricardo?

140
00:08:25,771 --> 00:08:28,899
I don't mind Ricardo. I just wanted
to see if you cared about me.

141
00:08:29,008 --> 00:08:30,635
But you don't care.

142
00:08:30,743 --> 00:08:33,109
"He's so stupid.
He's for you."

143
00:08:33,179 --> 00:08:36,410
There are other more stupid. Those
who orginized a picnic to court...

144
00:08:36,482 --> 00:08:39,542
and finished with a
platonic friendship.

145
00:08:40,086 --> 00:08:42,054
Leave me alone! Don<i>'</i>t
get closer.

146
00:08:42,121 --> 00:08:43,520
But we're friends.

147
00:08:43,589 --> 00:08:46,057
Well, I don't want
to be your friend.

148
00:08:46,292 --> 00:08:48,522
So you prefer...

149
00:08:49,962 --> 00:08:51,327
Yes Jorge.

150
00:08:58,137 --> 00:09:00,196
No one can love you like I do.

151
00:09:02,441 --> 00:09:05,672
But say nothing to your sister
until she has accepted Pedro.

152
00:09:05,745 --> 00:09:07,713
And now let's go because
it's late.

153
00:09:08,314 --> 00:09:11,078
- So you detest me.
- Just like that.

154
00:09:11,150 --> 00:09:12,777
Then we end here.

155
00:09:12,852 --> 00:09:14,285
We're finished.

156
00:09:14,387 --> 00:09:16,321
Ok. Give me my
stuff back.

157
00:09:17,290 --> 00:09:18,154
What stuff?

158
00:09:18,224 --> 00:09:20,124
My sighs, the sleepless
nights thinking

159
00:09:20,226 --> 00:09:22,251
about you, the kisses
that I've given you.

160
00:09:22,361 --> 00:09:23,760
You have given me?

161
00:09:23,829 --> 00:09:25,421
Well, in thoughts.

162
00:09:25,531 --> 00:09:27,897
I don't want you closer
not even in thoughts.

163
00:09:27,967 --> 00:09:30,993
Then I don't know what I'm
doing here. I'd better go.

164
00:09:31,103 --> 00:09:32,570
As you wish.

165
00:09:33,039 --> 00:09:34,836
So you getting rid of me?

166
00:09:35,341 --> 00:09:37,502
Ok. I'll go.

167
00:09:38,778 --> 00:09:41,076
- Good bye.
- Good bye.

168
00:09:44,317 --> 00:09:46,547
Don't you think that we have to
say good-bye as good friends?

169
00:09:46,652 --> 00:09:50,520
Of course. Good bye "Perico".
Have a nice day.

170
00:09:50,623 --> 00:09:52,022
Won't you give me a kiss?

171
00:09:52,091 --> 00:09:54,616
Are you crazy? I<i>'</i>m not
one of your girlies.

172
00:09:55,294 --> 00:09:56,556
A kiss of friends.

173
00:09:56,629 --> 00:09:58,563
Friends don't give kisses.

174
00:09:58,631 --> 00:09:59,962
OK. A kiss of
brothers.

175
00:10:00,066 --> 00:10:01,328
Neither.

176
00:10:02,168 --> 00:10:03,692
And if I steal it?

177
00:10:04,570 --> 00:10:06,094
I don't think you'll dare.

178
00:10:06,205 --> 00:10:07,001
Why?

179
00:10:07,106 --> 00:10:09,301
Because I'd break your head.

180
00:10:09,375 --> 00:10:12,003
- Oh yeah?
- Yeah.

181
00:10:13,512 --> 00:10:14,979
There it is.

182
00:10:15,081 --> 00:10:17,049
Now break my head.

183
00:10:25,791 --> 00:10:30,160
Jorge, come here! Pedro fainted!

184
00:10:30,429 --> 00:10:32,488
The hell! You gave
me such a fright!

185
00:10:32,565 --> 00:10:33,930
I thought you were dead.

186
00:10:34,033 --> 00:10:35,033
Almost.

187
00:10:35,134 --> 00:10:38,365
Look, you broke my head.

188
00:10:38,871 --> 00:10:42,534
- I always keep a promise.
- I see.

189
00:10:43,009 --> 00:10:44,271
What happened?

190
00:10:44,343 --> 00:10:46,573
Your sister broke my head.

191
00:10:46,646 --> 00:10:48,944
- But Maria.
- Ask him why.

192
00:10:49,548 --> 00:10:50,207
What did you do, Pedro?

193
00:10:50,316 --> 00:10:51,396
Don't look at me like that.

194
00:10:51,617 --> 00:10:53,847
I only gave her an innocent
kiss on the cheek.

195
00:10:55,521 --> 00:10:58,979
Hey siste, it was too much
for a kiss on the cheek.

196
00:10:59,091 --> 00:11:01,525
Imagine if he had given me
the kiss on the mouth.

197
00:11:01,627 --> 00:11:05,927
I'd be taken out the ammunition
from his belly.

198
00:11:06,699 --> 00:11:08,929
You were right, buddy.

199
00:11:09,268 --> 00:11:10,963
Today was your day.

200
00:11:11,437 --> 00:11:13,166
Your lucky day!

201
00:11:13,372 --> 00:11:17,775
It was just for you to learn,
so you behave well.

202
00:11:18,177 --> 00:11:19,177
Babe.

203
00:11:34,026 --> 00:11:38,190
Two Serious Guys.

204
00:13:23,869 --> 00:13:27,600
- Hi Chucho!
- Hi Jorgito. How do you do?

205
00:13:27,706 --> 00:13:29,105
Working.

206
00:13:29,175 --> 00:13:30,175
I'll leave her.

207
00:13:30,242 --> 00:13:32,176
Washed, greased and cleaned, ok?

208
00:13:32,244 --> 00:13:34,735
Do you want us to
lend you a horse?

209
00:13:36,115 --> 00:13:39,778
This is really a first class
service, but I'd rather walk.

210
00:13:40,920 --> 00:13:43,354
What is Mr. Jorge Bueno
doing these place?

211
00:13:43,422 --> 00:13:47,518
Hi Tiburcio! Let's start
not calling me mister.

212
00:13:47,626 --> 00:13:49,355
...and call me just
Jorge as usual.

213
00:13:49,461 --> 00:13:52,919
God forbid! You're a very rich man and
I don't want to be disrepectful.

214
00:13:52,998 --> 00:13:54,932
Look Tiburcio, forget that.

215
00:13:55,000 --> 00:13:58,163
Money is just to spend, not
to show off among friends.

216
00:13:58,237 --> 00:14:01,570
- Hey buddy, I'm so happy to see you.
- Me too.

217
00:14:01,674 --> 00:14:03,114
Well, now you can tell
me what is the

218
00:14:03,209 --> 00:14:05,049
purpose of the visit and
what can I do for you?

219
00:14:05,110 --> 00:14:07,578
I want some cattle. Do
you have some to sell?

220
00:14:08,414 --> 00:14:10,245
Only that on my head.

221
00:14:10,349 --> 00:14:12,249
Listen, but I can
sell you my ranch.

222
00:14:12,351 --> 00:14:14,717
- Let's see it.
- Right away.

223
00:14:14,787 --> 00:14:15,515
Do you smoke?

224
00:14:15,621 --> 00:14:16,417
No, thanks.

225
00:14:16,522 --> 00:14:19,719
If you want it we can pick
your friend Pedro up.

226
00:14:19,925 --> 00:14:22,723
- Is Pedro here?
- Yeah, didn't you know?

227
00:14:23,062 --> 00:14:24,689
First time I hear it.

228
00:14:24,763 --> 00:14:28,324
- It's been a year since I saw him.
- Ok, let's pick him up.

229
00:14:28,834 --> 00:14:32,930
No Tiburcio, I came here looking for
cattle. I don't care about morons.

230
00:14:33,138 --> 00:14:36,130
So this is Jorgito,
always joking.

231
00:14:46,285 --> 00:14:47,285
Terrific!

232
00:14:47,686 --> 00:14:49,813
You got on my nerves!

233
00:14:49,889 --> 00:14:50,321
Why? - I don't know what

234
00:14:50,422 --> 00:14:52,856
I don't know what kind
of feelings you've got.

235
00:14:52,925 --> 00:14:56,053
Only God knows how is suffering
my little daughter...

236
00:14:56,161 --> 00:14:58,891
...and you, the husband,
so easy.

237
00:14:58,998 --> 00:15:00,898
So if I worry, the baby
will be born sooner?

238
00:15:00,966 --> 00:15:05,096
Of course not, but you'd demonstrate
that you love your wife.

239
00:15:05,170 --> 00:15:07,104
She's a girl. You
can come in.

240
00:15:07,172 --> 00:15:08,764
Your first-
born, son.

241
00:15:08,874 --> 00:15:12,605
Can you see father-in-law?
We didn't need that scene.

242
00:15:15,447 --> 00:15:20,077
Let see, where is
my newborn rose?

243
00:15:20,719 --> 00:15:22,846
Ups, she's so ugly!

244
00:15:22,922 --> 00:15:29,384
This rose is not even a spine. She
has the face of his grandfather.

245
00:15:29,495 --> 00:15:30,535
She's like dad, isn't she?

246
00:15:30,596 --> 00:15:31,790
She's his living image.

247
00:15:31,897 --> 00:15:36,231
But who says that she's ugly. She's
as beautiful as a Lebanon flower.

248
00:15:36,302 --> 00:15:39,328
We're going to call her as
my grandmother, Latifa.

249
00:15:39,405 --> 00:15:42,238
No, don't spoil her
with that name.

250
00:15:42,308 --> 00:15:45,004
Ok, she's going to be
Rosario, like me.

251
00:15:46,845 --> 00:15:49,871
Oh God, I haven't seen you.

252
00:15:49,982 --> 00:15:52,644
You're so ruined, Chayito.

253
00:15:52,885 --> 00:15:55,581
Yeah, look at the state you
have left your mother.

254
00:15:55,688 --> 00:15:59,283
Aren't you ashamed? She's
totally rambling.

255
00:15:59,358 --> 00:16:00,950
Where's the color of her cheeks?

256
00:16:01,026 --> 00:16:02,721
Those eyes so beautiful.

257
00:16:02,795 --> 00:16:04,990
Those red lips, where are they?

258
00:16:05,097 --> 00:16:06,655
You ate them, didn't you?

259
00:16:06,732 --> 00:16:09,860
You are just born and you are causing
a lot of damage, like the scourge.

260
00:16:09,935 --> 00:16:11,334
Don't hate her.

261
00:16:11,403 --> 00:16:13,337
It's the first thing
his going to do.

262
00:16:13,405 --> 00:16:15,635
He who is a bad husband,
a bad father will be.

263
00:16:15,708 --> 00:16:18,404
Men like these shoudn't
have children.

264
00:16:18,477 --> 00:16:23,744
Hey father-in-law, don<i>'</i>t spoil the
moment. Well, I think I'm leaving.

265
00:16:24,383 --> 00:16:26,248
- Good bye, Chayito.
- Where are you going?

266
00:16:26,352 --> 00:16:29,219
I'm going to invite my friends
a drink, because of the birth.

267
00:16:29,288 --> 00:16:32,485
We have to celebrate, don't
we? Excuse me sir.

268
00:16:34,560 --> 00:16:40,829
Hey my little girl, you were so wrong
getting married to this cheeky devil.

269
00:16:41,000 --> 00:16:42,365
All men are equal.

270
00:16:42,468 --> 00:16:44,936
As long as he respects
me, leave him have fun.

271
00:16:45,004 --> 00:16:47,905
My "Perico" is not responsible
for his luck with girls.

272
00:16:47,973 --> 00:16:50,737
But that is not luck,
is to abuse.

273
00:16:50,809 --> 00:16:54,643
Whatever. I'm not going to lose
my husband for being jelous.

274
00:16:54,980 --> 00:16:57,244
He loves me so much
and I do too...

275
00:16:57,316 --> 00:16:58,214
That's enough for me.

276
00:16:58,283 --> 00:17:00,581
Ok. I have a clear
conscience,

277
00:17:00,686 --> 00:17:04,178
because you got married
without my permission.

278
00:17:36,455 --> 00:17:39,390
You've got a new baby

279
00:17:39,458 --> 00:17:42,222
I'll tell you later when she's
going to be baptized.

280
00:17:42,327 --> 00:17:45,626
And while I find my
child's godfather...

281
00:17:45,731 --> 00:17:47,289
...I invite you to drink...

282
00:17:47,399 --> 00:17:50,300
have a drink, since
here is your father!

283
00:17:50,536 --> 00:17:53,334
The father of the child,
don't misunderstand.

284
00:17:59,845 --> 00:18:02,075
Look at the mob this guy has.

285
00:18:02,147 --> 00:18:04,308
Get in and don't let
our child go out.

286
00:18:04,383 --> 00:18:08,114
Honorio! I invite the
drinks to my friends!

287
00:18:08,187 --> 00:18:10,155
And get ready to dance!

288
00:18:10,255 --> 00:18:12,519
I've got a partner
for all of you!

289
00:18:14,726 --> 00:18:19,220
Hey Perico don't mess around, what
a way to celebrate a birth!

290
00:18:19,298 --> 00:18:20,526
What's wrong?

291
00:18:20,632 --> 00:18:22,463
My house is for families.

292
00:18:22,534 --> 00:18:24,764
Aren't we in familiar spirit?

293
00:18:24,870 --> 00:18:28,135
Yeah, familiar, and..
. Bring Mrs. Matilde.

294
00:18:28,240 --> 00:18:31,869
Of course. With all her daughters,
everything is in family!

295
00:18:33,345 --> 00:18:36,439
Don't play with me, you
want to catch me ruined.

296
00:18:36,515 --> 00:18:39,245
But Mr. Bueno,
don't be bad.

297
00:18:40,219 --> 00:18:42,050
Give me at least $40,000.

298
00:18:42,154 --> 00:18:44,520
No Tiburcio. I have
told you that I give

299
00:18:44,590 --> 00:18:47,115
you no more than $25,000,
and that's final.

300
00:18:47,659 --> 00:18:50,719
Hey kid, two cold beers.

301
00:18:50,796 --> 00:18:51,820
Yes sir.

302
00:18:53,298 --> 00:18:56,358
<i>The other night I went
partying at Julia's.</i>

303
00:18:57,703 --> 00:19:00,763
<i>The family was present.</i>

304
00:19:02,207 --> 00:19:05,643
<i>Mary Pepa congratulates
Luz and Otilia.</i>

305
00:19:05,711 --> 00:19:08,976
<i>And Camila was the
joy of the reunion.</i>

306
00:19:09,047 --> 00:19:12,414
<i>And while Lupe fed her baby.</i>

307
00:19:13,585 --> 00:19:17,146
<i>Mrs. Cleta ask for
a drink to Celia.</i>

308
00:19:17,789 --> 00:19:21,623
<i>She lined the intimates
on two rows</i>

309
00:19:22,127 --> 00:19:25,756
<i>and we drank charanda
from Morelia.</i>

310
00:19:26,398 --> 00:19:27,956
<i>After that Amelia</i>

311
00:19:28,066 --> 00:19:29,727
<i>played a grammophone</i>

312
00:19:29,835 --> 00:19:32,929
<i>and we danced all together.</i>

313
00:19:33,038 --> 00:19:34,801
<i>There was a cadet</i>

314
00:19:34,873 --> 00:19:36,465
<i>who was jelous of Chelo</i>

315
00:19:36,575 --> 00:19:40,671
<i>but she was dancing with Gaspar.</i>

316
00:19:44,149 --> 00:19:46,811
<i>Come on and dance Mrs. Matilde.</i>

317
00:19:48,453 --> 00:19:52,321
<i>They gave us jelly sandwichs.</i>

318
00:19:52,858 --> 00:19:56,055
<i>Punch to some of them, and
Coca Cola to the others.</i>

319
00:19:57,095 --> 00:20:00,792
<i>As the maid was serving so steady.</i>

320
00:20:00,866 --> 00:20:04,563
<i>I went to the kitchen with my tray.</i>

321
00:20:04,670 --> 00:20:08,572
<i>I found there Ofelia's friends.</i>

322
00:20:09,308 --> 00:20:13,176
<i>Who have passed their
tequila hidden.</i>

323
00:20:13,612 --> 00:20:17,480
<i>And we drank behind the sink.</i>

324
00:20:17,950 --> 00:20:21,215
<i>And Amelia almost caught us</i>

325
00:20:22,154 --> 00:20:25,851
<i>then they ask Lola to sing.</i>

326
00:20:25,958 --> 00:20:30,861
<i>And we suffered "Here goes my
farewell". After that auntie Cleta</i>

327
00:20:30,929 --> 00:20:32,521
<i>played the pianola.</i>

328
00:20:32,631 --> 00:20:37,261
<i>And we applauded a lot so</i>
s <i>he couldn't complain.</i>

329
00:20:45,077 --> 00:20:46,476
Do you play?

330
00:20:46,578 --> 00:20:47,135
What?

331
00:20:47,212 --> 00:20:48,577
Do you to play?

332
00:20:48,647 --> 00:20:51,047
Oh yeah, sorry, I was absent-minded.

333
00:20:51,116 --> 00:20:54,517
Not that much, you killed
my double-six.

334
00:20:55,520 --> 00:20:57,215
I'd like to kill someone else.

335
00:20:57,322 --> 00:20:58,050
Double one?

336
00:20:58,123 --> 00:20:59,317
No, someone else.

337
00:21:00,759 --> 00:21:01,759
Listen to me.

338
00:21:02,594 --> 00:21:04,194
That one singing is Pedro
Malo, isn't he?

339
00:21:04,496 --> 00:21:07,260
Yeah. And don't say
that I abuse.

340
00:21:07,532 --> 00:21:09,693
Ask him the value of the ranch
I'm offering to you.

341
00:21:09,768 --> 00:21:11,565
I give water to Pedro
and others...

342
00:21:12,137 --> 00:21:13,399
But Pedro has properties here.

343
00:21:13,472 --> 00:21:14,734
Those ones I showed you.

344
00:21:14,940 --> 00:21:18,535
If it weren't for my spring, he
woudn't crop a single corncob.

345
00:21:18,677 --> 00:21:21,305
Life on those properties depends
on the ranch I'm offering you.

346
00:21:21,513 --> 00:21:23,276
Ask Pedrito and you'll see.

347
00:21:24,750 --> 00:21:25,750
I'm going to ask him.

348
00:21:27,119 --> 00:21:28,119
Wait for me.

349
00:21:35,661 --> 00:21:39,119
<i>I had the guts and sang you a</i>
song to Eufemia.

350
00:21:39,965 --> 00:21:43,332
<i>That I sang out of key
and they made fun of me.</i>

351
00:21:44,202 --> 00:21:47,660
<i>I faced him, but Eufemia
stopped me.</i>

352
00:21:48,540 --> 00:21:52,101
<i>Otherwise he'd be standing
on line at the Limbo.</i>

353
00:21:52,177 --> 00:21:55,840
<i>But the jelly was
already digested.</i>

354
00:21:56,481 --> 00:22:00,042
<i>Beacause the lady of the
general joined us.</i>

355
00:22:00,786 --> 00:22:04,017
<i>And nosy Carola goes gossiping.</i>

356
00:22:04,890 --> 00:22:08,417
<i>And the husband comes and
the quarrell started.</i>

357
00:22:09,161 --> 00:22:10,924
<i>The row started.</i>

358
00:22:10,996 --> 00:22:13,157
<i>He pull out his gun.</i>

359
00:22:13,231 --> 00:22:15,961
<i>I hid myself behind the pianola.</i>

360
00:22:16,068 --> 00:22:17,763
<i>The police came</i>

361
00:22:17,836 --> 00:22:19,497
<i>as Carola called.</i>

362
00:22:19,604 --> 00:22:25,042
<i>And we went to the jail all together.</i>

363
00:22:32,084 --> 00:22:35,576
Come on girls, party is
alright, but some order!

364
00:22:35,654 --> 00:22:38,646
Go fooling around,
but decent, ok?

365
00:22:38,757 --> 00:22:42,124
Look at your luck with girls.

366
00:22:42,194 --> 00:22:46,631
It seem so Mrs. Matilde, but all
that glitters is not gold.

367
00:22:47,032 --> 00:22:48,499
I'm not lucky with them.

368
00:22:48,567 --> 00:22:49,625
Don't say so.

369
00:22:49,735 --> 00:22:51,327
That's true. No woman
takes me seriously

370
00:22:51,436 --> 00:22:53,131
because they say I'm dating
a lot of girls.

371
00:22:53,238 --> 00:22:55,604
And I have to date many because
no one takes me seriously.

372
00:22:55,674 --> 00:22:57,164
You can't complain about us.

373
00:22:57,576 --> 00:22:59,009
I'm talking about women.

374
00:22:59,077 --> 00:23:00,374
And what are we?

375
00:23:00,712 --> 00:23:02,907
You're... girlies.

376
00:23:03,014 --> 00:23:06,916
- But your woman.
- My woman has his own place.

377
00:23:08,954 --> 00:23:09,954
Jorge.

378
00:23:14,793 --> 00:23:17,284
How seriously happy
I am to see you.

379
00:23:18,764 --> 00:23:19,764
Yes.

380
00:23:20,499 --> 00:23:23,127
You've got to be
seriously happy.

381
00:23:25,437 --> 00:23:27,496
That's how I speak.

382
00:23:28,006 --> 00:23:29,006
You're a swine.

383
00:23:31,443 --> 00:23:32,443
You're right.

384
00:23:33,278 --> 00:23:36,042
I was telling the
girls about that.

385
00:23:36,648 --> 00:23:37,945
I'm so unhappy.

386
00:23:39,284 --> 00:23:41,343
At least you accept it.

387
00:23:42,921 --> 00:23:43,921
Well, yeah.

388
00:23:44,856 --> 00:23:47,324
- How did you know that I was here?
- By chance.

389
00:23:48,293 --> 00:23:51,057
We have to met some
day, don't we?

390
00:23:52,063 --> 00:23:53,063
Of course.

391
00:23:55,767 --> 00:23:58,565
What about talking in there?

392
00:23:59,371 --> 00:24:00,531
Let's talk.

393
00:24:01,373 --> 00:24:02,533
Come in.

394
00:24:04,142 --> 00:24:05,142
You first.

395
00:24:16,488 --> 00:24:17,887
I just came to make a complaint.

396
00:24:20,725 --> 00:24:21,725
Tell me.

397
00:24:23,595 --> 00:24:25,290
Why didn't you invite
me to your wedding?

398
00:24:25,931 --> 00:24:28,559
I'd gladly have gone.

399
00:24:29,167 --> 00:24:30,167
Well, err.

400
00:24:31,136 --> 00:24:33,127
Everything was so fast.

401
00:24:34,372 --> 00:24:36,636
Besides, you know the way that
I am and how I proceed.

402
00:24:37,542 --> 00:24:38,542
Yeah.

403
00:24:39,511 --> 00:24:42,810
Now I know how you are and
the way you make things.

404
00:24:43,348 --> 00:24:45,373
Crawling like a reptile!

405
00:24:45,884 --> 00:24:48,216
Betraying friends and
cheating on women.

406
00:24:49,287 --> 00:24:50,287
Aren't you?

407
00:24:51,790 --> 00:24:55,658
You married my girlfriend knowing that
I loved her and I pretended her.

408
00:24:57,762 --> 00:25:02,062
Of coures, you don<i>'</i>t dare
to face me, that's enough!

409
00:25:03,235 --> 00:25:08,434
My sister knew better. She didn't
believed in your wicked love!

410
00:25:08,773 --> 00:25:11,105
Because she could
forsee your kind!

411
00:25:12,477 --> 00:25:15,935
And I was stupid enough helping
you in good faith...

412
00:25:16,214 --> 00:25:17,875
for you to be my
brother-in-law.

413
00:25:18,483 --> 00:25:21,418
Such a nice worm I was going
to include in the family!

414
00:25:23,321 --> 00:25:25,881
And don't think that I'm hurt because
you marry my girlfriend.

415
00:25:26,157 --> 00:25:28,125
If a woman cheats on you...

416
00:25:28,593 --> 00:25:31,653
forgive her and that's it,
ultimately she's a woman.

417
00:25:33,131 --> 00:25:37,363
But when you're betrayed by who
you think is your best friend...

418
00:25:38,169 --> 00:25:41,332
Ah Chihuahua, it hurts!

419
00:25:45,076 --> 00:25:46,703
And you're still laughing?

420
00:25:49,981 --> 00:25:52,882
Answer me, answer me!

421
00:25:55,287 --> 00:25:56,914
You won't say nothing...

422
00:25:57,722 --> 00:25:59,587
being such a coward.

423
00:26:12,070 --> 00:26:14,561
The comedy of my love.

424
00:26:22,647 --> 00:26:24,444
- Have you talked to Pedrito?
- Yeah.

425
00:26:24,516 --> 00:26:25,916
What did he tell you
about my ranch?

426
00:26:26,418 --> 00:26:27,418
Your ranch?

427
00:26:29,087 --> 00:26:32,056
Oh yeah, he told me that it was
a good investment. I buy it.

428
00:26:32,123 --> 00:26:33,181
In $40,000?

429
00:26:33,291 --> 00:26:35,691
No matter the price! Let's
go signing the deed.

430
00:26:35,760 --> 00:26:36,760
OK.

431
00:26:44,803 --> 00:26:49,069
Grease those spings that
creak like new shoes!

432
00:26:49,374 --> 00:26:50,568
Don't worry
Mr. Elias.

433
00:26:50,675 --> 00:26:53,075
Clean it well with oil.

434
00:26:53,178 --> 00:26:55,646
Work well so I can
give you a tip!

435
00:26:56,681 --> 00:26:58,012
Good luck, Jorgito.

436
00:26:58,083 --> 00:27:00,176
Thanks buddy.

437
00:27:00,986 --> 00:27:04,820
Am I dreaming or am I saying
hello to Mr. Jorgito?

438
00:27:05,657 --> 00:27:06,783
How do you do
Mr. Elias?

439
00:27:07,192 --> 00:27:09,217
Why are you so serious
with your friend?

440
00:27:09,294 --> 00:27:11,592
You used to hug me in the past.

441
00:27:11,663 --> 00:27:13,654
You have said so,
in other times.

442
00:27:13,732 --> 00:27:16,997
You seem to be mad at
me. Yes, you're angry.

443
00:27:17,068 --> 00:27:21,061
But you're wrong. I alwas wanted
you to be my son-in-law.

444
00:27:22,273 --> 00:27:24,503
Look Mr. Elias, we'd better
not talk about it.

445
00:27:24,776 --> 00:27:28,735
Yeah, I've gotta talk, 'cause you think
I was responsible, but I was not.

446
00:27:28,980 --> 00:27:32,416
I know nothing that happened. I
wash my hands, as Pilate did.

447
00:27:32,517 --> 00:27:35,714
You can say that I'm a fool, but
I can't understand what happend.

448
00:27:35,787 --> 00:27:37,721
Now tell me one thing..

449
00:27:38,356 --> 00:27:41,621
Why did you argue, my daughter and
you, if you were getting married?

450
00:27:42,594 --> 00:27:44,118
Things that happen,
Mr. Elias.

451
00:27:44,195 --> 00:27:48,131
Maybe you remember that last time
I saw her, about a year ago...

452
00:27:48,366 --> 00:27:52,268
there was a fair at town, and she didn't
want to go because of a headache.

453
00:27:52,370 --> 00:27:53,530
I remember.

454
00:27:53,638 --> 00:27:57,233
Then I was confident that she
woudn't go, I invited a girl.

455
00:27:57,342 --> 00:28:01,005
You understand, don't you? One of
these friends bachelors have.

456
00:28:09,387 --> 00:28:15,519
<i>My dark lady, it seems that
it's time for a huapango...</i>

457
00:28:16,194 --> 00:28:21,530
<i>My dark lady, it seems that
it's time for a huapango...</i>

458
00:28:22,634 --> 00:28:30,634
<i>While she swings in her hammock,
I'm watching her...</i>

459
00:28:31,910 --> 00:28:35,778
<i>And whe she shakes, I ask
her what's up, when.</i>

460
00:28:35,847 --> 00:28:39,715
<i>What's up, when?</i>

461
00:28:43,755 --> 00:28:48,351
<i>That lady in a wrap
has been sighing...</i>

462
00:28:50,161 --> 00:28:55,895
<i>That lady in a wrap
has been sighing...</i>

463
00:28:56,601 --> 00:29:04,007
<i>if that charro doesn't love
her, we're ready..</i>.

464
00:29:05,710 --> 00:29:09,168
<i>And because I don't want her so
sad I ask her what's up, when.</i>

465
00:29:09,247 --> 00:29:12,705
<i>What's up, when?</i>

466
00:29:17,422 --> 00:29:21,950
<i>And though I'm not new to love,
I'm not exceeding myself.</i>

467
00:29:23,828 --> 00:29:28,925
<i>And though I'm not new to love,
I'm not exceeding myself.</i>

468
00:29:30,502 --> 00:29:37,806
<i>I'm like a bread that becomes
softer on any mouth..</i>

469
00:29:39,611 --> 00:29:43,047
<i>And when I see her alone I dare
to ask her what's up, when...</i>

470
00:29:43,148 --> 00:29:47,448
<i>What's up, when?</i>

471
00:29:52,323 --> 00:29:58,626
<i>On the banch of an holm oak
a goldfinch is whistling...</i>

472
00:29:58,730 --> 00:30:03,565
<i>On the banch of an holm oak
a goldfinch is whistling...</i>

473
00:30:05,303 --> 00:30:13,303
<i>What a beautiful olive-skinned
girl to join us...</i>

474
00:30:14,679 --> 00:30:17,443
<i>And with all respect
I ask her...</i>

475
00:30:18,316 --> 00:30:19,340
<i>What's up?</i>

476
00:30:19,651 --> 00:30:21,016
<i>When?</i>

477
00:30:21,119 --> 00:30:25,647
<i>What's up, when?</i>

478
00:30:29,694 --> 00:30:35,929
<i>That charro and that lady are
just staring at each other...</i>

479
00:30:36,267 --> 00:30:40,966
<i>That charro and that lady are
just staring at each other...</i>

480
00:30:42,574 --> 00:30:50,574
<i>Forget the papers and
you can do it...</i>

481
00:30:52,483 --> 00:30:56,180
<i>And to avoid being indiscreet,
I ask them what's up, when?</i>

482
00:30:56,254 --> 00:31:00,816
<i>What's up, when?</i>

483
00:31:04,295 --> 00:31:09,198
<i>A nice colt whinnies in the
stable from time to time...</i>

484
00:31:09,500 --> 00:31:11,058
Ah, but you were here?

485
00:31:11,135 --> 00:31:12,693
Tell Jorge to come.

486
00:31:12,804 --> 00:31:15,466
- But we're going to..
- Tell him to come or I'll go for him.

487
00:31:15,540 --> 00:31:18,475
Alright, I'll go. Take this,
baby. I'll be back.

488
00:31:19,811 --> 00:31:26,273
<i>...sighing.</i>

489
00:31:27,452 --> 00:31:31,320
<i>And first of all, I ask
her what's up, when..</i>

490
00:31:31,422 --> 00:31:33,049
<i>What's up?</i>

491
00:31:33,157 --> 00:31:34,886
<i>What's.</i>

492
00:31:35,026 --> 00:31:39,986
<i>What's up, when?</i>

493
00:31:42,867 --> 00:31:44,027
Hey buddy...

494
00:31:44,802 --> 00:31:47,032
With Victorita's permission,
can I talk to you?

495
00:31:47,305 --> 00:31:49,068
- Yes sir..
- Where are you going to?

496
00:31:49,240 --> 00:31:50,639
I'll be back in a minute...

497
00:31:52,043 --> 00:31:53,635
Let's go...

498
00:31:55,046 --> 00:31:56,843
Hey, Rosario is there..

499
00:31:57,181 --> 00:31:58,648
- Here?
- Yeah, here.

500
00:31:59,217 --> 00:32:01,417
- She told me that she wasn't coming.
- But she's there.

501
00:32:03,288 --> 00:32:06,257
Mmm, she's keeping watch on me.

502
00:32:07,558 --> 00:32:09,355
You'll see how fast
I work this out.

503
00:32:10,194 --> 00:32:11,218
Take care of this one.

504
00:32:11,529 --> 00:32:13,690
Listen to me, I've got mine.

505
00:32:13,898 --> 00:32:15,331
Just for a moment.

506
00:32:18,202 --> 00:32:21,137
- Just don't go too far.
- Hey Jorge, I'm surprised..

507
00:32:21,239 --> 00:32:23,207
Yeah, but I don't want
to be surprised.

508
00:32:31,182 --> 00:32:32,182
What's up Vitolita?

509
00:32:32,350 --> 00:32:33,476
What's up, when?

510
00:32:33,818 --> 00:32:34,818
Easy Perico.

511
00:32:35,219 --> 00:32:38,154
What's wrong, we're almost brothers,
and besides I'm the substitute.

512
00:32:38,256 --> 00:32:39,450
It doesn't matter.

513
00:32:40,358 --> 00:32:41,620
Are you so decent?

514
00:32:42,260 --> 00:32:44,626
- Well,
- Well what?

515
00:32:45,363 --> 00:32:48,457
Is there a way.
...this glass?

516
00:32:48,566 --> 00:32:49,566
What?

517
00:32:50,702 --> 00:32:53,466
What's your play?
Weren't you ill?

518
00:32:53,538 --> 00:32:56,564
You can see that I wasn't. I just wanted
to catch you with that woman.

519
00:32:57,508 --> 00:33:01,239
I'm glad that you found me this way,
so you'll get rid of this habit.

520
00:33:01,946 --> 00:33:03,573
Is that all you can say?

521
00:33:03,748 --> 00:33:06,308
Aren't you ashamed of been seen
everywhere with that woman?

522
00:33:06,384 --> 00:33:10,616
I can tell you that not being my wife,
you don't have the right to tell me this.

523
00:33:10,722 --> 00:33:11,347
How?

524
00:33:11,456 --> 00:33:13,754
I gave you your place
by inviting you first.

525
00:33:13,858 --> 00:33:16,088
You didn't want to come,
it was up to you.

526
00:33:16,194 --> 00:33:17,957
Well I'm here. Leave that
woman alone and let's go.

527
00:33:18,029 --> 00:33:19,029
I can't leave her.

528
00:33:19,230 --> 00:33:21,755
- Why?
- Because I invited her to come. OK?

529
00:33:22,266 --> 00:33:26,498
Jorge, try to understand that I'm right.
What's wrong leaving that woman?

530
00:33:26,704 --> 00:33:28,035
I won't make a fool myself.

531
00:33:28,139 --> 00:33:31,939
No matter who she is, I'll be a
gentleman and I won't leave her.

532
00:33:32,276 --> 00:33:33,573
And you leave me standing up?

533
00:33:33,678 --> 00:33:35,908
Have you forgot who I am?
I'm your girlfriend.

534
00:33:35,980 --> 00:33:37,447
I'm not a tart.

535
00:33:37,548 --> 00:33:41,143
In fact because you're my girlfriend,
you shouldn't play this comedy.

536
00:33:42,487 --> 00:33:44,955
I don't want you to do
this again. Come on!

537
00:33:45,690 --> 00:33:48,750
Go home, I forgive you.

538
00:33:49,293 --> 00:33:52,160
How can it be? Now you're
the offended.

539
00:33:52,230 --> 00:33:54,164
I'm the offended.

540
00:33:54,232 --> 00:33:55,529
Then I don't beg you.

541
00:33:55,633 --> 00:33:57,593
I demand you to leave that
woman and come with me.

542
00:33:57,802 --> 00:33:59,269
Otherwise, we're finished.

543
00:34:00,805 --> 00:34:02,568
- Is that you're last word?
- The last one.

544
00:34:15,186 --> 00:34:16,186
Wait for me there.

545
00:34:20,658 --> 00:34:21,658
What happend?

546
00:34:21,759 --> 00:34:23,727
Nothing buddy. I
sent her home.

547
00:34:24,262 --> 00:34:25,593
See her bright idea.

548
00:34:25,663 --> 00:34:29,599
She came to order me to leave Victoria
stand up to go with her.

549
00:34:29,667 --> 00:34:32,761
Can you imagine my position?
What did she think?

550
00:34:32,904 --> 00:34:35,702
- And what was the result?
- We're finished.

551
00:34:35,840 --> 00:34:38,274
- No man.
- Yeah, but it'll be just some days,

552
00:34:38,376 --> 00:34:40,844
You know, she'll be forgiving
me, as all girls do.

553
00:34:40,945 --> 00:34:43,209
That's true. The've got no
choice but to forgive.

554
00:34:43,281 --> 00:34:44,839
While they're are our girls,
they can't do anything.

555
00:34:44,916 --> 00:34:46,474
- See you later.
- Bye.

556
00:34:56,828 --> 00:34:58,955
I confess that I felt guilty.

557
00:34:59,130 --> 00:35:01,257
But when I wanted to see
Rosario to apologize...

558
00:35:01,365 --> 00:35:03,060
I found out that you were away.

559
00:35:03,167 --> 00:35:05,829
Now I understand why my daughter
came in that night...

560
00:35:05,903 --> 00:35:10,897
saying "Dad, please don<i>'</i>t mention
Jorge again. He's dead to me".

561
00:35:11,976 --> 00:35:12,772
And where did you go?

562
00:35:12,844 --> 00:35:15,938
To Mexico City. She wanted to forget
about you no matter what.

563
00:35:16,047 --> 00:35:19,073
Some two months later,
cheeky Pedro came...

564
00:35:19,150 --> 00:35:22,677
and all of a sudden, I learnt
that they were married.

565
00:35:23,387 --> 00:35:25,378
Well, as long as she's happy.

566
00:35:25,490 --> 00:35:31,019
I don't think so. She can't be happy
with that bad, unloving father.

567
00:35:31,596 --> 00:35:32,893
Do you have a grandchild?

568
00:35:32,997 --> 00:35:34,988
A very beautiful, nice girl.

569
00:35:35,099 --> 00:35:37,192
- In fact, she was born today.
- Today?

570
00:35:38,669 --> 00:35:42,537
- And this bastard is...
- Say it, partying...

571
00:35:42,607 --> 00:35:44,802
He's been like that since
he got married.

572
00:35:44,909 --> 00:35:47,673
- What a bastard!
- Do you realize my tragedy?

573
00:35:47,778 --> 00:35:49,507
I feel sorry for
you, Mr. Elias.

574
00:35:49,580 --> 00:35:51,639
And you should be sorry for him.

575
00:35:51,749 --> 00:35:54,980
Because you pay the price forthese
things sooner or later.

576
00:35:55,520 --> 00:35:56,646
Your car is ready, sir.

577
00:35:56,954 --> 00:35:58,216
Bye Jorgito.

578
00:36:04,962 --> 00:36:06,623
Goodbye son, have a nice trip.

579
00:36:06,731 --> 00:36:08,460
Goodbye Mr. Elias.
Goodbye Chucho.

580
00:36:08,566 --> 00:36:10,534
- Goodbye Jorgito.
- Goodbye son.

581
00:36:11,636 --> 00:36:14,799
- Hi! I want you to fix that tire.
- Leave it there.

582
00:36:15,673 --> 00:36:17,436
But you're going to lend
me a horse, aren<i>'</i>t you?

583
00:36:17,508 --> 00:36:18,508
A horse...

584
00:36:18,576 --> 00:36:21,807
That's for those with a car. If you
want it, you can take that donkey.

585
00:36:32,223 --> 00:36:34,282
- Three kings.
- Not useful. Run.

586
00:36:34,792 --> 00:36:36,487
Hi buddy, how do you do?

587
00:36:36,594 --> 00:36:37,253
Fine buddy.

588
00:36:37,361 --> 00:36:40,728
And I'm not lucky at all, I don't
know what's happening..

589
00:36:43,367 --> 00:36:45,733
That's why!
Look at it..

590
00:36:46,003 --> 00:36:47,561
What an eyesight you have!

591
00:36:47,638 --> 00:36:51,335
Why don't you go somewhere else?

592
00:36:51,742 --> 00:36:54,506
There are sights that are
worse than a fly...

593
00:36:54,812 --> 00:36:57,838
I knew a peasant that by seeing
his neighbour's cornfield...

594
00:36:58,149 --> 00:36:59,616
...he'd dried it out.

595
00:36:59,750 --> 00:37:01,149
- A hundred!
- Ok.

596
00:37:01,285 --> 00:37:03,446
Losing all the time.

597
00:37:03,521 --> 00:37:04,521
We open with a ten.

598
00:37:07,091 --> 00:37:08,786
Once again the same bad luck!

599
00:37:11,429 --> 00:37:12,429
What's up, Jorge?

600
00:37:13,598 --> 00:37:14,826
Now I see.

601
00:37:15,366 --> 00:37:17,891
One of those who can dry
out a plant has arrived.

602
00:37:18,502 --> 00:37:19,502
Where do you come from?

603
00:37:19,570 --> 00:37:20,594
What's up, Tules?

604
00:37:20,705 --> 00:37:22,673
The lost has appeared.
What's up buddies?

605
00:37:22,773 --> 00:37:26,038
- What brought you this way?
- Just to say hello to friends.

606
00:37:26,644 --> 00:37:28,407
Have you got one left?

607
00:37:29,480 --> 00:37:30,742
Well, those who were...

608
00:37:30,848 --> 00:37:32,782
and besides to talk
to you, Jorge.

609
00:37:33,050 --> 00:37:35,484
You can tell me when.
Right now!

610
00:37:35,653 --> 00:37:39,419
Just speak in front of me, so
ypou don't give me bad luck.

611
00:37:40,658 --> 00:37:42,182
A card to the center.

612
00:37:42,994 --> 00:37:43,994
Give me two.

613
00:37:46,998 --> 00:37:49,159
No, no, this way.

614
00:37:51,535 --> 00:37:54,936
Over there, lean on that column.

615
00:38:02,546 --> 00:38:03,546
Ok.

616
00:38:04,849 --> 00:38:05,941
What's all about?

617
00:38:06,017 --> 00:38:08,542
I wanted to talk about the ranch
you bought by my property.

618
00:38:10,921 --> 00:38:12,946
- The one with the spring, right?
- Yeah.

619
00:38:13,024 --> 00:38:14,024
It's open.

620
00:38:15,726 --> 00:38:17,819
- I'm ready.
- Give me four.

621
00:38:24,735 --> 00:38:27,169
- So then?
- You know that several farmers...

622
00:38:27,238 --> 00:38:29,706
...use water from that spring, and l...
I pass!

623
00:38:29,907 --> 00:38:31,431
- $300 more.
- I can<i>'</i>t.

624
00:38:31,542 --> 00:38:33,510
$300 and what's left.
I can't either.

625
00:38:37,481 --> 00:38:38,481
You was telling me..

626
00:38:39,383 --> 00:38:43,319
I want to work this out,
so I won't lack of water.

627
00:38:45,022 --> 00:38:47,013
- I pay.
- Three aces.

628
00:38:47,091 --> 00:38:48,991
I don't need'em. Pool of kings.

629
00:38:49,093 --> 00:38:50,583
Terrific! And in four cards only.

630
00:38:50,695 --> 00:38:52,663
- Well...
- How lucky.

631
00:38:52,897 --> 00:38:55,491
Sure. You can see where he is.

632
00:38:57,401 --> 00:38:58,959
So...

633
00:38:59,670 --> 00:39:00,967
what about the water?

634
00:39:03,007 --> 00:39:05,168
How much is it going
to be for irrigation?

635
00:39:05,710 --> 00:39:06,710
Oh..

636
00:39:07,912 --> 00:39:11,973
...being for you,
$5,000 a month.

637
00:39:12,416 --> 00:39:13,974
$5,000?

638
00:39:14,652 --> 00:39:17,143
But all the rest of
us pay $200 a year.

639
00:39:17,221 --> 00:39:19,587
You've said so, the
rest of you...

640
00:39:20,458 --> 00:39:21,789
It's $5,000 for you.

641
00:39:22,460 --> 00:39:25,122
If you like it, and if
not, forget about it.

642
00:39:26,731 --> 00:39:29,131
I don't know if it's
woth to tell you..

643
00:39:29,200 --> 00:39:32,169
That all my hopes are
on that harvest.

644
00:39:32,269 --> 00:39:35,170
If you don't give me water,
I'll lose everything.

645
00:39:36,540 --> 00:39:37,540
Hey man.

646
00:39:37,908 --> 00:39:39,466
I'm glad to know that.

647
00:39:41,712 --> 00:39:42,872
I'm glad!

648
00:39:43,948 --> 00:39:46,746
So you bought that
ranch to ruin me?

649
00:39:47,218 --> 00:39:48,446
To ruin you?

650
00:39:49,053 --> 00:39:52,181
Do you think that I can do that?

651
00:39:52,356 --> 00:39:56,087
To you, being so good,
honest and loyal...

652
00:39:56,160 --> 00:39:58,128
Such a good friend!

653
00:39:59,330 --> 00:40:01,491
Alright Jorge, no way!

654
00:40:02,900 --> 00:40:05,425
Gentlemen, you learnt
how it goes...

655
00:40:06,036 --> 00:40:08,630
My property in such conditions
is worthless...

656
00:40:08,739 --> 00:40:10,934
but in some other hands,
it's a good business.

657
00:40:11,175 --> 00:40:13,166
Does anybody want it?

658
00:40:15,946 --> 00:40:20,212
Let's make it easier. Give me a $1,000
pesos credit to play with you...

659
00:40:20,384 --> 00:40:23,319
and if in 1 hour I don't give
them back, you can keep it.

660
00:40:24,021 --> 00:40:25,716
Don't bother the gentlemen...

661
00:40:26,424 --> 00:40:29,188
Good friends are for such times...

662
00:40:30,060 --> 00:40:31,857
Do you want a rope to hang you?

663
00:40:32,463 --> 00:40:34,260
I<i>'</i>ll gladly give it to you.

664
00:40:35,032 --> 00:40:36,499
Here are $1,000 pesos.

665
00:40:37,334 --> 00:40:40,497
No, I didn't make
my offer to you.

666
00:40:41,572 --> 00:40:43,506
Since surely I'm going
to lose, well...

667
00:40:44,141 --> 00:40:46,803
...I want my property
in better hands.

668
00:40:48,345 --> 00:40:49,710
What do you say, gentlemen?

669
00:40:51,982 --> 00:40:53,643
I think you should accept.

670
00:40:53,751 --> 00:40:56,379
I won't take it the
wrong way, come on!

671
00:40:56,454 --> 00:40:57,546
$250 each one!

672
00:40:57,621 --> 00:41:00,249
- There are mine.
- I even leave my place to the man.

673
00:41:00,458 --> 00:41:02,221
No, you can stay.

674
00:41:02,927 --> 00:41:05,293
I give you the chance to give
me the coup de grce.

675
00:41:05,930 --> 00:41:06,930
What's up?

676
00:41:08,933 --> 00:41:09,797
I accept.

677
00:41:09,900 --> 00:41:12,596
- Give me the chair, buddy.
- Ok, you'll see.

678
00:41:18,442 --> 00:41:19,807
$100 pesos to beguin.

679
00:41:20,077 --> 00:41:21,942
- You go.
- Cut!

680
00:41:38,729 --> 00:41:39,923
Let's see.

681
00:41:39,997 --> 00:41:41,021
Well see.

682
00:41:41,131 --> 00:41:42,428
The first to speak.

683
00:41:42,500 --> 00:41:43,500
Do you start?

684
00:41:43,601 --> 00:41:45,068
- You?
- No.

685
00:41:47,204 --> 00:41:48,330
I start wit $200.

686
00:41:49,473 --> 00:41:50,735
My turn.

687
00:41:53,277 --> 00:41:54,437
$200.

688
00:41:56,413 --> 00:41:58,574
- And $500 more.
- No man, that's a lot.

689
00:41:58,649 --> 00:41:59,843
Don't play like that.

690
00:42:00,317 --> 00:42:01,317
No, I don't risk.

691
00:42:01,418 --> 00:42:03,352
- It is not that good.
- Neither do l.

692
00:42:04,655 --> 00:42:06,655
You'll understand that my
shot was not against you.

693
00:42:06,690 --> 00:42:09,454
- I want to catch my friend.
- Thanks.

694
00:42:10,561 --> 00:42:11,561
What you deserve...

695
00:42:15,499 --> 00:42:16,499
Your turn, buddy.

696
00:42:16,534 --> 00:42:18,502
$50. It starts.

697
00:42:20,237 --> 00:42:21,237
Here they are.

698
00:42:29,113 --> 00:42:30,193
Give me some good ones, ok?

699
00:42:31,181 --> 00:42:31,875
Let's see.

700
00:42:31,949 --> 00:42:33,883
It's good.

701
00:42:36,320 --> 00:42:37,320
There isn't.

702
00:42:37,788 --> 00:42:39,050
I'll see if I'm lucky...

703
00:42:39,323 --> 00:42:40,585
I start with $200

704
00:42:41,292 --> 00:42:42,292
I pass

705
00:42:53,871 --> 00:42:54,871
$200...

706
00:42:57,508 --> 00:42:59,203
...and your rest.
There isn't.

707
00:43:00,911 --> 00:43:02,879
This time I can<i>'</i>t
run. I go.

708
00:43:03,881 --> 00:43:04,881
Do you have a triple?

709
00:43:05,449 --> 00:43:06,449
Yeah.

710
00:43:07,551 --> 00:43:10,111
Did you bring the deed
of your property?

711
00:43:10,254 --> 00:43:11,254
Yeah.

712
00:43:11,455 --> 00:43:13,047
I was well prepared.

713
00:43:14,325 --> 00:43:15,325
Give me two cards.

714
00:43:18,095 --> 00:43:19,095
Well gentlemen...

715
00:43:20,531 --> 00:43:22,294
after finishing here...

716
00:43:22,499 --> 00:43:25,627
you go to the notary's office
to sign the deed.

717
00:43:26,637 --> 00:43:28,628
And as my gift.

718
00:43:29,573 --> 00:43:31,473
Water is free for you.

719
00:43:33,477 --> 00:43:35,172
My cards face up.

720
00:43:36,847 --> 00:43:38,474
Ah, a full.

721
00:43:38,916 --> 00:43:40,213
To finish it.

722
00:43:40,584 --> 00:43:43,712
A full, three aces
and two kings.

723
00:43:43,954 --> 00:43:46,218
Now you've seen, buddy.
Have a better game?

724
00:43:58,535 --> 00:43:59,934
A two.

725
00:44:01,138 --> 00:44:02,537
Well...

726
00:44:14,918 --> 00:44:15,918
At last!

727
00:44:16,320 --> 00:44:18,311
At last? What?

728
00:44:20,290 --> 00:44:22,417
- The other four.
- Poker on four!

729
00:44:22,526 --> 00:44:26,053
What a lucky guy.
What a game he had!

730
00:44:26,463 --> 00:44:29,159
- Terrific!
- What a luck!

731
00:44:29,800 --> 00:44:31,665
The Hell!
What a luck!

732
00:44:31,769 --> 00:44:35,296
What a lucky guy.
You won us...

733
00:44:37,174 --> 00:44:38,300
Gentlemen...

734
00:44:38,409 --> 00:44:40,809
...we have five minutes
left for the deadline.

735
00:44:41,879 --> 00:44:45,315
Here's your money. Thank
you very much.

736
00:44:45,482 --> 00:44:49,213
Not even in two years of good harvest
I could have won so much.

737
00:44:49,319 --> 00:44:50,115
You had luck.

738
00:44:50,220 --> 00:44:52,415
It is true that rascals
have luck.

739
00:44:52,523 --> 00:44:54,163
- Good evening, gentlemen.
- Good evening.

740
00:44:54,224 --> 00:44:55,623
Wait Jorge!

741
00:44:56,927 --> 00:44:59,794
I give you all that I won
in exchange of water.

742
00:44:59,897 --> 00:45:01,421
Water is all that I want.

743
00:45:01,965 --> 00:45:03,899
- Really?
- Nothing else.

744
00:45:04,001 --> 00:45:06,561
Hey man, you could have said so.

745
00:45:07,171 --> 00:45:09,071
- Chucho!
- Yes master?

746
00:45:10,541 --> 00:45:12,221
Bring this gentleman a
big bottle of water.

747
00:45:15,913 --> 00:45:17,380
Here you are, master.

748
00:45:20,217 --> 00:45:21,217
Here you are.

749
00:45:22,219 --> 00:45:23,311
Thank you, sir!

750
00:45:23,787 --> 00:45:25,448
Are you leaving again?

751
00:45:25,689 --> 00:45:27,452
No, I'm staying as a tourist.

752
00:45:28,392 --> 00:45:30,826
To see if I can take
from Jorge...

753
00:45:30,894 --> 00:45:32,862
something else besides
his money.

754
00:45:41,271 --> 00:45:42,602
Have many days like today...

755
00:45:42,706 --> 00:45:44,173
Thank you, Madam.

756
00:45:45,209 --> 00:45:45,937
Congratulations.

757
00:45:46,009 --> 00:45:48,068
Thank you.
Ok, let's go walking.

758
00:45:53,050 --> 00:45:55,314
Your dress is so beautiful!
Do you like it?

759
00:45:55,385 --> 00:45:56,647
It was dad's gift.

760
00:45:56,754 --> 00:45:59,086
One of them, because you haven't
seen the main one.

761
00:45:59,156 --> 00:46:02,387
This aftenoon's party. Such a
big party to be remembered!

762
00:46:02,459 --> 00:46:05,587
- Isn't that Jorge?
- General, as everything you organize.

763
00:46:05,662 --> 00:46:08,187
Well, I leave you beacause I have
to go to the station to pick up...

764
00:46:08,298 --> 00:46:10,528
a very special cognac. Excuse
me, good afternoon.

765
00:46:10,634 --> 00:46:12,602
See you later General.

766
00:46:15,906 --> 00:46:18,170
My good frieng. I didn't
expect you here!

767
00:46:18,275 --> 00:46:20,573
How do you do, General.
I'm at your service.

768
00:46:20,677 --> 00:46:24,773
Listen Pedrito. I expect you by 6 in
my house. It's my daughter's bithday.

769
00:46:26,316 --> 00:46:29,410
I guess Jorge and his family
will be there, don't they?

770
00:46:29,520 --> 00:46:31,112
Of course.

771
00:46:31,555 --> 00:46:33,352
- You must be there!
- Of course general.

772
00:46:33,457 --> 00:46:35,049
I'm not used to miss
such events.

773
00:46:35,159 --> 00:46:37,593
- Count me on.
- Ok, see you later.

774
00:46:40,998 --> 00:46:41,998
Pedro.

775
00:46:44,234 --> 00:46:46,930
- Come here.
- Damn!

776
00:46:51,341 --> 00:46:53,741
- What are you doing here?
- You're surprised, aren't you?

777
00:46:53,811 --> 00:46:57,406
Last time we argued, I said
you were a bad man...

778
00:46:57,514 --> 00:47:01,177
miserable tyrant of my daughter,
I said everything!

779
00:47:01,251 --> 00:47:02,946
And to repeat that, you
bother yourself to come!

780
00:47:03,020 --> 00:47:07,013
Let me tell you everything I've gotta
say, and then you speak, ok?

781
00:47:07,124 --> 00:47:08,124
Ok.

782
00:47:08,625 --> 00:47:10,525
The problems have with
your father-in-law...

783
00:47:10,594 --> 00:47:13,028
...are not for you to abandon
your wife and daughter!

784
00:47:13,096 --> 00:47:15,963
Oh shit! Why do you say that
I have abandoned them?

785
00:47:16,033 --> 00:47:21,403
Isn't it abandonment to desert without
conset and stay a far away?

786
00:47:21,505 --> 00:47:24,303
No sir! I have to work out
an urgent problem here.

787
00:47:24,408 --> 00:47:26,933
It is also very urgent to
meet your family's needs!

788
00:47:27,044 --> 00:47:29,478
That's why I brougth Rosario
and the baby this way!

789
00:47:29,580 --> 00:47:30,808
- They're here?
- Yes sir!

790
00:47:30,914 --> 00:47:32,677
Damn! Why did you
bring them here?

791
00:47:32,749 --> 00:47:36,549
Because you musn't show off as a
bachelor. You're married, sir!

792
00:47:36,653 --> 00:47:39,178
No sir! You're going back
to town right away!

793
00:47:39,289 --> 00:47:42,349
You're wrong son! From now
on, wherever you go...

794
00:47:42,459 --> 00:47:44,689
even to hell, your wife and your
daughter will go with you.

795
00:47:44,761 --> 00:47:46,558
No, no, no sir!

796
00:47:46,663 --> 00:47:48,654
- You'll see, uncle.
- I'm not your uncle.

797
00:47:48,732 --> 00:47:50,666
Unfortunately, I'm
your father-in-law!

798
00:47:50,734 --> 00:47:54,261
You don't seem so. You seem
to be a nosy mother-in-law!

799
00:47:54,571 --> 00:47:57,472
Oh yeah? That's what
I look like for you?

800
00:47:58,041 --> 00:48:01,909
Tomorrow I'll go to Veracruz
to take a ship...

801
00:48:02,012 --> 00:48:04,845
and I'll go to my homeland. You
stay here with your wife,

802
00:48:04,948 --> 00:48:06,438
...and we'll se how you
manage with her...

803
00:48:06,550 --> 00:48:10,919
Will anybody look after her like me?
I have even neglected my business.

804
00:48:11,288 --> 00:48:15,224
It's up to you! Do you want the
nosy mother-in-law to leave?

805
00:48:15,325 --> 00:48:17,088
Don't do that uncle, don't go.

806
00:48:17,160 --> 00:48:19,025
What will Rosarito
do without you?

807
00:48:19,096 --> 00:48:21,189
That's what I say sir.

808
00:48:21,498 --> 00:48:26,197
If you're a good boy with a great
heart, why don't you well behave?

809
00:48:26,303 --> 00:48:29,568
Behave well with my daghter, and
you'll have everything with me.

810
00:48:29,640 --> 00:48:32,837
Not money, but lots
of friendship.

811
00:48:32,943 --> 00:48:35,639
Why do you have to be arguing
with me all the time?

812
00:48:36,613 --> 00:48:40,049
Let's go to you hotel to check
out and we'll go home.

813
00:48:40,984 --> 00:48:41,984
What home?

814
00:48:42,085 --> 00:48:46,351
Have you forgoten, Pedrito, that
we have our abandoned house here?

815
00:48:46,690 --> 00:48:49,853
Ok. Let's go home, sir.

816
00:48:49,927 --> 00:48:53,363
More respect for your
father-in law, Pedro.

817
00:48:54,731 --> 00:48:57,894
You're so funny, really.

818
00:48:57,968 --> 00:48:59,936
We'll go in a minute, doctor,
don't be impatient.

819
00:49:00,003 --> 00:49:02,904
- I'm not in a hurry, Josefa.
- Anastasia!

820
00:49:03,807 --> 00:49:05,434
What happend with my tie?

821
00:49:05,509 --> 00:49:07,306
- What's up doctor.
- It's here!

822
00:49:07,377 --> 00:49:09,277
Do you know who arrived at noon?

823
00:49:09,379 --> 00:49:12,815
- Who?
- Who else can it be? Rosario.

824
00:49:13,216 --> 00:49:16,413
She's not that young.
She has a baby.

825
00:49:16,520 --> 00:49:19,216
- Is she married to Mr. Pedro?
- Shut up!

826
00:49:21,825 --> 00:49:25,420
Anastasia, you musn't mention
those names in this house!

827
00:49:25,495 --> 00:49:28,430
- This shall be the last time!
- Yes Madam.

828
00:49:40,477 --> 00:49:42,342
You still love her, don't you?

829
00:49:47,017 --> 00:49:48,985
- No, I don't.
- You don't fool me.

830
00:49:49,353 --> 00:49:51,514
You're still in love
with Rosario.

831
00:49:51,722 --> 00:49:54,953
Not in love.
I'm ill.

832
00:49:56,593 --> 00:50:00,495
It's a chronic illness that goes and
comes back when you least expect it.

833
00:50:00,630 --> 00:50:03,690
There's a song for that illness.

834
00:50:04,034 --> 00:50:05,626
A spoon of oblivion...

835
00:50:05,969 --> 00:50:08,028
and drops from another love.

836
00:50:08,238 --> 00:50:11,298
Yeah, my prescription is
a wedding with Genoveva.

837
00:50:12,376 --> 00:50:15,971
Let's see if insted of
a spoon, it's a rub!

838
00:50:17,247 --> 00:50:20,239
You'll go to the doctor's.
I'll meet you there.

839
00:50:24,154 --> 00:50:27,351
We have a beautiful baby here.

840
00:50:37,534 --> 00:50:42,369
...tha beautifil baby we have
here. Look at the pigeons.

841
00:50:42,572 --> 00:50:45,234
Look at them. Don't you
want to see them?

842
00:50:48,011 --> 00:50:50,104
We have more pigeons
here baby...

843
00:50:50,914 --> 00:50:52,108
See you later, Chayo.

844
00:50:52,783 --> 00:50:53,943
Won't you stay for lunch?

845
00:50:54,051 --> 00:50:57,578
I have to go with some friends.
Business lunch.

846
00:50:57,687 --> 00:51:00,713
- See you tomorrow, Mr. Elias.
- See you tomorrow?

847
00:51:00,791 --> 00:51:03,351
Does it mean you're
coming back at dawn?

848
00:51:03,427 --> 00:51:05,361
Or by day. You
can nver know.

849
00:51:05,462 --> 00:51:07,828
Have you seen, baby?

850
00:51:07,898 --> 00:51:11,493
You cannot keep your mouth closed
with a man like this.

851
00:51:11,635 --> 00:51:14,001
He's a carouser, shameless.

852
00:51:14,271 --> 00:51:17,468
But to avoid your grandpa been
called a nosy mother-in-law...

853
00:51:17,541 --> 00:51:20,203
We put on my lips a patch.

854
00:51:20,610 --> 00:51:22,009
And we can deal with
the carouser.

855
00:51:22,145 --> 00:51:23,373
There you go again, dad?

856
00:51:23,480 --> 00:51:26,677
I'm saying nothig, but talking
to my grandchild.

857
00:51:26,750 --> 00:51:29,378
See you tomorrow
Pedrito. Do well.

858
00:51:29,986 --> 00:51:32,147
Son of my heart.

859
00:51:54,911 --> 00:51:56,344
Try not to come back
late, Pedro.

860
00:51:56,413 --> 00:51:58,313
I don't want my dad
to start talking.

861
00:51:58,381 --> 00:52:00,645
Don't worry for your
husband, Madam.

862
00:52:00,750 --> 00:52:01,750
Pedro!

863
00:52:10,527 --> 00:52:11,527
Jorge!

864
00:52:17,767 --> 00:52:19,234
Aren't you ashamed to see me?

865
00:52:20,337 --> 00:52:21,337
I don't think so!

866
00:52:22,205 --> 00:52:25,003
If you were ashamed, you
wouldn't have come.

867
00:52:25,675 --> 00:52:26,733
Jorge, please.

868
00:52:27,077 --> 00:52:29,170
I feel sorry for you.

869
00:52:30,013 --> 00:52:33,540
When a woman like you and a man
like him are join by betrayal...

870
00:52:34,050 --> 00:52:35,813
they always finish the same.

871
00:52:36,052 --> 00:52:37,644
She cheats on her husband.

872
00:52:37,821 --> 00:52:40,221
And him, abandoning her!

873
00:52:40,790 --> 00:52:41,882
It never fails!

874
00:52:43,960 --> 00:52:46,224
<i>You are, darling...</i>

875
00:52:46,296 --> 00:52:49,163
<i>who got me in ecstasies..</i>

876
00:52:49,466 --> 00:52:54,062
<i>Why should I deny that
I'm in love with you?</i>

877
00:52:54,437 --> 00:52:57,565
<i>From your sweet soul</i>

878
00:52:57,641 --> 00:53:01,941
<i>that is full of feelings.</i>

879
00:53:03,914 --> 00:53:10,012
<i>With those black eyes with
a strange shining.</i>

880
00:53:10,554 --> 00:53:15,253
<i>That control me and demand
me to love you.</i>

881
00:53:15,325 --> 00:53:21,355
<i>You're my delight,
you're my illusion.</i>

882
00:53:24,401 --> 00:53:28,201
<i>I know that glory...</i>

883
00:53:28,271 --> 00:53:31,434
<i>is in Heaven...</i>

884
00:53:33,743 --> 00:53:37,975
<i>and is to mortals...</i>

885
00:53:38,048 --> 00:53:42,951
<i>the hope when they die.</i>

886
00:53:43,286 --> 00:53:49,191
<i>I bless God because having
you in lifetieme...</i>

887
00:53:49,259 --> 00:53:52,990
<i>I don't need to go to Heaven.</i>

888
00:53:53,096 --> 00:53:56,259
<i>Yes darling,</i>

889
00:53:57,667 --> 00:54:02,764
<i>you're the Glory...</i>

890
00:54:10,380 --> 00:54:12,644
Sorry to be a little
late. Good afternoon.

891
00:54:12,983 --> 00:54:16,043
Don't worry. You're
just in time.

892
00:54:16,486 --> 00:54:18,010
Please come in.

893
00:54:18,288 --> 00:54:21,815
We'll drink a cognac that is not
a cognac, it's a Heaven's gift!

894
00:54:28,098 --> 00:54:30,464
- What are you doing here?
- I was invited.

895
00:54:31,534 --> 00:54:32,534
Sponger!

896
00:54:36,506 --> 00:54:38,440
Ladies and Gentlemen...

897
00:54:39,542 --> 00:54:41,772
I want to officialy announce...

898
00:54:41,878 --> 00:54:46,178
my daughter's engagement
to Mr. Jorge Bueno...

899
00:54:46,316 --> 00:54:49,285
who has honored me
to ask her hand...

900
00:54:49,452 --> 00:54:53,548
and I will tell you that
I congratulate myself...

901
00:54:53,657 --> 00:54:56,091
because without offending
those of you here...

902
00:54:56,159 --> 00:54:59,617
I wouldn't find a
better son-in-law.

903
00:55:06,169 --> 00:55:08,729
Bravo! Good!

904
00:55:11,741 --> 00:55:14,869
Now you pay compliments
to the happy couple.

905
00:55:14,978 --> 00:55:16,946
I was ready for it!

906
00:55:18,448 --> 00:55:20,712
Ready guys!

907
00:55:23,820 --> 00:55:25,185
Let's start!

908
00:55:27,590 --> 00:55:30,058
<i>People honestly say...</i>

909
00:55:30,293 --> 00:55:35,060
<i>in every wedding</i>

910
00:55:35,865 --> 00:55:41,167
<i>bridegroom always love her,
but to have his funeral...</i>

911
00:55:42,305 --> 00:55:48,471
<i>this bride has no sorrow, because
she 'll have a good husband.</i>

912
00:55:48,578 --> 00:55:53,709
<i>Jorge Bueno is a good thing,
at least his last name...</i>

913
00:55:54,617 --> 00:55:56,915
<i>Jorge Bueno is very good...</i>

914
00:55:57,087 --> 00:55:59,317
<i>son of Bueno too...</i>

915
00:55:59,422 --> 00:56:02,084
<i>and his grandfather, very good,</i>

916
00:56:02,192 --> 00:56:04,558
<i>that had his name.</i>

917
00:56:10,433 --> 00:56:12,526
Play for me, but a little higher.

918
00:56:14,237 --> 00:56:21,405
<i>I'll try to be as good
as my last name...</i>

919
00:56:22,245 --> 00:56:27,444
<i>let him drink his poison who
has demanded a funeral...</i>

920
00:56:28,451 --> 00:56:30,976
<i>Pedro has a bad last name.</i>

921
00:56:31,054 --> 00:56:34,182
<i>I'll answer to his verses.</i>

922
00:56:34,758 --> 00:56:38,489
<i>He only wants to show off,
because he isn't bad, is...</i>

923
00:56:39,162 --> 00:56:41,062
<i>hopeless.</i>

924
00:56:41,965 --> 00:56:44,433
<i>Pedro Malo is very bad...</i>

925
00:56:44,801 --> 00:56:46,928
<i>bad by destiny...</i>

926
00:56:47,036 --> 00:56:49,231
<i>and his gandfather, uy!
What a bad guy...</i>

927
00:56:49,339 --> 00:56:52,433
<i>we got to buy him a lion.</i>

928
00:56:57,147 --> 00:56:58,944
<i>On a sunny morning...</i>

929
00:56:59,015 --> 00:57:04,920
<i>sombody clouded the landscape...</i>

930
00:57:05,722 --> 00:57:10,557
<i>there were a crow and a parrot
tearing out their feathers.</i>

931
00:57:12,095 --> 00:57:17,226
<i>You've got to forget the past,
if luck is guilty...</i>

932
00:57:18,368 --> 00:57:21,667
<i>Good and Bad mixed...</i>

933
00:57:22,405 --> 00:57:25,135
<i>turn out mediocre.</i>

934
00:57:25,208 --> 00:57:27,733
<i>I'm bad, don't deny it...</i>

935
00:57:28,144 --> 00:57:32,774
<i>but I'd like to mix Good
and Bad to see...</i>

936
00:57:32,849 --> 00:57:35,147
<i>if you get something fair.</i>

937
00:57:39,489 --> 00:57:41,650
Please do something. Those
guys are going to fight.

938
00:57:43,393 --> 00:57:45,987
<i>Easy you scaveger scorpion...</i>

939
00:57:46,095 --> 00:57:52,193
<i>you were visiting an apiary...</i>

940
00:57:52,836 --> 00:57:59,071
<i>to see if poison could
be removed with honey</i>

941
00:57:59,175 --> 00:58:05,045
<i>and goodness is not for evil...</i>

942
00:58:06,249 --> 00:58:10,276
<i>with honey and his poison,
today he's...</i>

943
00:58:10,954 --> 00:58:13,218
<i>purged!</i>

944
00:58:13,323 --> 00:58:16,486
<i>Let him be understood,
who can understand him...</i>

945
00:58:16,559 --> 00:58:19,050
<i>if he can be understood...</i>

946
00:58:19,128 --> 00:58:22,029
<i>and if he can't understand...</i>

947
00:58:22,131 --> 00:58:25,328
<i>he's got to be forced to understand.</i>

948
00:58:26,569 --> 00:58:28,036
I'm going to tell the
orchestra to play.

949
00:58:28,137 --> 00:58:29,137
Why?

950
00:58:30,740 --> 00:58:34,699
<i>It is clear to you that I'm
not a fool like you...</i>

951
00:58:35,712 --> 00:58:38,681
<i>has showed...</i>

952
00:58:39,582 --> 00:58:41,777
<i>Not a fool, but a meddler...</i>

953
00:58:41,885 --> 00:58:43,853
<i>for your hunger...</i>

954
00:58:44,954 --> 00:58:47,752
<i>of friends.</i>

955
00:58:48,324 --> 00:58:53,660
<i>I always calm my hunger
with my friend's food...</i>

956
00:58:55,164 --> 00:59:00,261
<i>Beggar, but a beggar who
steals his friends...</i>

957
00:59:01,437 --> 00:59:02,437
<i>You say so.</i>

958
00:59:02,739 --> 00:59:04,036
<i>I stand for it!</i>

959
00:59:04,107 --> 00:59:06,234
<i>Don't be tired...</i>

960
00:59:06,409 --> 00:59:08,536
<i>- Don't avoid it!
- I avoid it.</i>

961
00:59:08,611 --> 00:59:10,579
<i>Then this song is over!</i>

962
00:59:12,148 --> 00:59:13,911
- Do you dance, Jorge?
- Later.

963
00:59:14,017 --> 00:59:15,507
Let's dance, please.

964
00:59:17,387 --> 00:59:18,387
Later.

965
00:59:27,530 --> 00:59:29,259
They're so playful.

966
00:59:34,203 --> 00:59:35,203
Maruca!

967
00:59:40,310 --> 00:59:41,868
Why don't you say hello?

968
00:59:42,278 --> 00:59:43,278
Who are you?

969
00:59:44,080 --> 00:59:47,811
The same "Periquito" who loves
you more everyday...

970
00:59:48,651 --> 00:59:49,811
Oh yes...

971
00:59:50,153 --> 00:59:53,589
That Perico who got his
head broken for liar.

972
00:59:54,090 --> 00:59:56,490
I would say that I was
sent away, wasn't I?

973
00:59:56,793 --> 00:59:58,886
But you found your cage...

974
00:59:59,095 --> 01:00:02,223
Not that much. Just ask me to
go, and I'll go with you.

975
01:00:02,732 --> 01:00:05,030
Look, don't start
with that crap!

976
01:00:05,368 --> 01:00:07,802
What crap, you got me spinning.

977
01:00:07,904 --> 01:00:09,269
You're not free.

978
01:00:09,339 --> 01:00:11,330
Remeber your status...

979
01:00:11,841 --> 01:00:13,331
But now I'm free.

980
01:00:14,177 --> 01:00:16,270
Well, quit bugging me,

981
01:00:16,346 --> 01:00:18,314
or you may have your
head broken again.

982
01:00:18,948 --> 01:00:19,948
I don't care!

983
01:00:20,283 --> 01:00:22,183
I love you with all my heart.

984
01:00:22,385 --> 01:00:24,012
They're going to break
you in pieces!

985
01:00:24,587 --> 01:00:25,587
So go away...

986
01:00:33,997 --> 01:00:36,329
If you haven't leave the
town by tomorrow...

987
01:00:36,633 --> 01:00:38,225
wherever I find you,
I'll kill you!

988
01:00:46,342 --> 01:00:47,809
Take care, mom...

989
01:00:47,977 --> 01:00:49,706
Are you sure you won't
need more money?

990
01:00:49,779 --> 01:00:51,076
No, I have enough.

991
01:00:51,381 --> 01:00:53,076
Don't restrict yourself, eh?

992
01:00:53,149 --> 01:00:55,811
Remember that I want the
best trousseau available.

993
01:00:55,918 --> 01:00:57,010
You'll see.

994
01:01:00,523 --> 01:01:01,581
Watch the sharp bends.

995
01:01:07,830 --> 01:01:08,830
Hey sir!

996
01:01:09,999 --> 01:01:10,999
What's up?

997
01:01:11,401 --> 01:01:12,401
What happened to Pedro?

998
01:01:12,468 --> 01:01:14,368
He didn't go. He's
at the casino.

999
01:01:17,140 --> 01:01:17,765
The fifth!

1000
01:01:18,107 --> 01:01:19,107
Here's the ace.

1001
01:01:19,609 --> 01:01:20,609
Double!

1002
01:01:21,044 --> 01:01:23,604
Hey Pedro, just think the
next play and we'll win.

1003
01:01:23,746 --> 01:01:25,611
He loses anyway!

1004
01:01:31,854 --> 01:01:32,854
I pass.

1005
01:01:32,989 --> 01:01:34,115
This is the good one.

1006
01:01:35,992 --> 01:01:36,992
Well, I won.

1007
01:01:38,494 --> 01:01:40,155
This game was well...

1008
01:01:40,463 --> 01:01:42,727
but I think it's the last
one of your life.

1009
01:01:43,900 --> 01:01:45,231
Step away, gentlemen!

1010
01:01:47,370 --> 01:01:49,031
This guy is going
to die right here!

1011
01:01:49,205 --> 01:01:50,205
I promised him!...

1012
01:01:50,640 --> 01:01:52,120
take your gun out and
defend yourself!

1013
01:01:52,675 --> 01:01:53,675
I don't have it.

1014
01:01:55,445 --> 01:01:58,243
- What a coincidence.
- It's not a coincidence, it's deliberately.

1015
01:01:59,048 --> 01:02:01,482
You wouldn't shot
an unarmed man.

1016
01:02:02,218 --> 01:02:03,685
You know me so well...

1017
01:02:04,987 --> 01:02:07,251
but it won't make a difference.
Lend me this!

1018
01:02:07,457 --> 01:02:08,457
Defend yourself!

1019
01:02:11,394 --> 01:02:13,692
I can't shoot my best friend.

1020
01:02:14,430 --> 01:02:15,430
Friend?

1021
01:02:16,132 --> 01:02:19,067
How you dare to say such word!

1022
01:02:19,936 --> 01:02:21,528
Well, in other words...

1023
01:02:22,271 --> 01:02:25,638
I can't shoot the brother of the woman
I love the most, do you undestand?

1024
01:02:27,777 --> 01:02:29,267
Gentlemen, you are witnesses.

1025
01:02:29,712 --> 01:02:32,442
This guy is a coward and
wants to die as a hero.

1026
01:02:32,982 --> 01:02:35,382
- That's why I'm going to please you.
- One moment...

1027
01:02:35,451 --> 01:02:38,614
I'm the one who's gonna please
you, as you want it.

1028
01:02:39,622 --> 01:02:41,749
Just the two of us in
the private room.

1029
01:02:43,826 --> 01:02:44,826
All right!

1030
01:03:29,105 --> 01:03:31,164
- Good bye, gentlemen.
- Goodbye.

1031
01:03:35,878 --> 01:03:36,878
It was so close!

1032
01:03:38,815 --> 01:03:39,543
Here you are.

1033
01:03:39,782 --> 01:03:43,218
- Hey Chucho, bring me a mariachi fast!
- Yes sir.

1034
01:03:55,832 --> 01:03:59,393
<i>Woman, open your window...</i>

1035
01:03:59,502 --> 01:04:04,269
<i>So you can hear my voice...</i>

1036
01:04:04,373 --> 01:04:07,103
<i>the man who loves you is singing</i>

1037
01:04:07,210 --> 01:04:10,236
<i>with God's permission...</i>

1038
01:04:10,346 --> 01:04:13,645
<i>you brighten my life...</i>

1039
01:04:13,749 --> 01:04:17,082
<i>and for that, dear woman...</i>

1040
01:04:17,253 --> 01:04:20,245
<i>I'm singing to you tonight...</i>

1041
01:04:20,323 --> 01:04:23,383
<i>that's why I'm here to steal...</i>

1042
01:04:23,459 --> 01:04:27,520
<i>a small ray of your light...</i>

1043
01:04:30,933 --> 01:04:36,530
<i>Wake up.</i>

1044
01:04:38,174 --> 01:04:43,009
<i>My love, my goodness...</i>

1045
01:04:45,348 --> 01:04:48,408
<i>What I'm sorry for, my love...</i>

1046
01:04:48,484 --> 01:04:55,447
<i>is to come here to make
you lose your sleep...</i>

1047
01:04:57,026 --> 01:05:03,226
<i>But wake up...</i>

1048
01:05:03,966 --> 01:05:06,264
<i>Wake up my love.</i>

1049
01:05:06,402 --> 01:05:12,238
<i>And listen to my sad song...</i>

1050
01:05:14,710 --> 01:05:17,645
<i>That your lover sings</i>

1051
01:05:17,847 --> 01:05:21,840
<i>that your possessor sings...</i>

1052
01:05:22,318 --> 01:05:29,019
<i>and it's for your love...</i>

1053
01:05:36,899 --> 01:05:44,899
<i>A t moonlight nights...</i>

1054
01:05:46,575 --> 01:05:51,069
<i>blossom perfum</i>

1055
01:05:51,814 --> 01:05:56,547
<i>a starry night</i>

1056
01:05:57,353 --> 01:06:01,312
<i>and a warm breeze</i>

1057
01:06:02,792 --> 01:06:10,792
<i>behind the grille,
covered with flowers</i>

1058
01:06:13,269 --> 01:06:17,706
<i>the fiance is waiting...</i>

1059
01:06:18,240 --> 01:06:20,572
<i>shaking...</i>

1060
01:06:20,843 --> 01:06:26,713
<i>of love, yes.</i>

1061
01:06:27,984 --> 01:06:35,516
<i>When I see those eyes</i>

1062
01:06:35,624 --> 01:06:42,496
<i>that nervously wait, white
stars loved their light.</i>

1063
01:06:43,966 --> 01:06:50,530
<i>Breeze scatters a better aroma</i>

1064
01:06:50,606 --> 01:06:53,598
<i>and all the flowers</i>

1065
01:06:53,943 --> 01:06:59,438
<i>sigh in love.</i>

1066
01:07:00,816 --> 01:07:06,482
<i>For a...</i>

1067
01:07:06,856 --> 01:07:12,192
<i>glance of those beautiful eyes,
the stars and flowers...</i>

1068
01:07:12,294 --> 01:07:15,263
<i>are jealous.</i>

1069
01:07:16,265 --> 01:07:18,665
<i>The breeze...</i>

1070
01:07:19,301 --> 01:07:25,467
<i>sighs, the sky..</i>

1071
01:07:25,841 --> 01:07:31,837
<i>Fades out...</i>

1072
01:07:36,218 --> 01:07:42,020
<i>and in the heart..</i>

1073
01:07:42,124 --> 01:07:44,490
<i>Wanders...</i>

1074
01:07:44,894 --> 01:07:47,522
<i>the jewell...</i>

1075
01:07:48,664 --> 01:07:53,294
<i>of love.</i>

1076
01:07:57,740 --> 01:07:58,740
Well guys,

1077
01:08:00,576 --> 01:08:01,668
Share it, ok?

1078
01:08:02,111 --> 01:08:03,669
Ok.

1079
01:08:04,713 --> 01:08:07,375
- Your cooperation.
- And remember.

1080
01:08:07,917 --> 01:08:09,748
I never came to sing
this serenade.

1081
01:08:10,052 --> 01:08:12,850
- Let's go.
- Ok sir.

1082
01:08:23,566 --> 01:08:25,966
Wouldn't you, baby?

1083
01:08:27,203 --> 01:08:29,398
I knew that you had
to come down, love.

1084
01:08:33,943 --> 01:08:35,240
Good evening,
mr. Elias.

1085
01:08:35,678 --> 01:08:36,736
How are you, sir?

1086
01:08:36,846 --> 01:08:39,747
Could you tell her to come down,
please. I want to talk to her.

1087
01:08:40,015 --> 01:08:42,245
Isn't it the same to talk to me?

1088
01:08:44,253 --> 01:08:47,518
Of course not! What would they think
if the see me making love to you?

1089
01:08:47,590 --> 01:08:50,252
Do you mean that you want to
make love to my daughter?

1090
01:08:50,359 --> 01:08:51,917
Keep away, sir.

1091
01:08:51,994 --> 01:08:53,120
My daughter has an owner.

1092
01:08:53,262 --> 01:08:55,753
- I'm going to be her owner.
- You're drunk.

1093
01:08:55,865 --> 01:08:57,196
Besides...

1094
01:08:57,933 --> 01:09:01,164
Once upon the time you wanted me to
be your son-in-law, and here I am.

1095
01:09:01,270 --> 01:09:05,366
Yeah. I wanted you to be my son-
in-law, but fair and square.

1096
01:09:05,441 --> 01:09:07,966
And this way, behind the
door, you can't be.

1097
01:09:08,077 --> 01:09:09,669
My daughter is married.

1098
01:09:09,945 --> 01:09:11,344
But I'm not a jealous guy.

1099
01:09:11,413 --> 01:09:12,413
But I am.

1100
01:09:12,815 --> 01:09:14,612
My daughter has a daughter.

1101
01:09:14,683 --> 01:09:16,446
We send her to the orphanage.

1102
01:09:16,652 --> 01:09:19,746
Oh yeah? And should we send her
husband to the orphanage?

1103
01:09:20,156 --> 01:09:21,748
The husband...

1104
01:09:22,625 --> 01:09:24,684
Hey Mr. Elias...

1105
01:09:26,228 --> 01:09:29,686
What a pity that I can't
tell you some matters...

1106
01:09:29,765 --> 01:09:33,223
But I can tell you to go with
you music somewhere else.

1107
01:09:33,335 --> 01:09:34,666
You don't have the right...

1108
01:09:34,770 --> 01:09:39,400
to come bugging a person for
no reason. Go away, please!

1109
01:09:39,808 --> 01:09:41,571
Ok, sir. I'm
leaving...

1110
01:09:42,378 --> 01:09:44,972
but tell Rosario
that I love her!

1111
01:09:45,047 --> 01:09:47,277
You want me to tell you that?

1112
01:09:47,349 --> 01:09:49,817
And want about if
I don't do that?

1113
01:09:49,885 --> 01:09:51,113
It doesn't matter...

1114
01:09:51,220 --> 01:09:54,553
she's listening to me
upstairs... Rosario!

1115
01:09:55,157 --> 01:09:57,352
I'm leaving because your
father throws me out!

1116
01:09:57,526 --> 01:09:59,050
But I want you to know...

1117
01:09:59,261 --> 01:10:02,992
that I love you,
I love you a lot!

1118
01:10:03,098 --> 01:10:05,464
But I don't love you,
and I can't love you.

1119
01:10:05,568 --> 01:10:07,126
You're responsible for that!

1120
01:10:07,236 --> 01:10:09,796
Do you remeber how much I begged
you and how you despised me?

1121
01:10:09,905 --> 01:10:11,736
That's why you married Rosario?

1122
01:10:11,840 --> 01:10:14,035
And besides being the girfriend
of your best friend...

1123
01:10:14,143 --> 01:10:15,701
she was your cousin?

1124
01:10:15,878 --> 01:10:18,847
As you ignored me, it
was the same for me...

1125
01:10:19,114 --> 01:10:23,175
Well, it doesn't surprise me coming
from you. You're so shameless.

1126
01:10:23,285 --> 01:10:26,083
But she, how could she have
accepted to be your woman?

1127
01:10:26,255 --> 01:10:28,883
If you grew up together,
you were like related.

1128
01:10:29,291 --> 01:10:31,885
It's like if I were married
to Jorge, how awful!

1129
01:10:31,994 --> 01:10:34,622
Putting it you way you
do, it seems awful.

1130
01:10:34,930 --> 01:10:37,626
But you can work this out.

1131
01:10:37,700 --> 01:10:39,565
Can I?

1132
01:10:39,668 --> 01:10:42,330
Just tell me that you love me and you'll
see how fast I untangle this...

1133
01:10:42,404 --> 01:10:44,804
- Oh yeah, is that easy?
- Sure!

1134
01:10:45,874 --> 01:10:47,967
You're so cynical and lazy!

1135
01:10:48,043 --> 01:10:49,101
Alright.

1136
01:10:49,678 --> 01:10:52,272
But you're the woman I've
loved the most in my life.

1137
01:10:52,348 --> 01:10:55,283
And you're the man I despise
and hate the most!

1138
01:10:56,919 --> 01:11:00,116
I swear you dad that I haven't give him
a reason to be offended this way.

1139
01:11:00,222 --> 01:11:03,555
I told you darling,
Jorge's drunk.

1140
01:11:03,626 --> 01:11:06,094
But most important is that
Pedro doesn't learn this.

1141
01:11:06,161 --> 01:11:08,527
Heaven help us, they might
shoot themselves!

1142
01:11:08,631 --> 01:11:11,725
Tomorrow, when he's sober,
I'll talk to Jorge.

1143
01:11:11,834 --> 01:11:13,563
You'll see that he won't
bug you again.

1144
01:11:13,669 --> 01:11:15,864
And the only responsible
is your husband,

1145
01:11:15,938 --> 01:11:17,872
that never spends
a night at home.

1146
01:11:17,973 --> 01:11:19,270
It's clear that he
doesn't love you.

1147
01:11:19,375 --> 01:11:21,309
He loves me with all his
heart, and me too.

1148
01:11:21,377 --> 01:11:22,537
Don't blame Pedro!

1149
01:11:22,645 --> 01:11:23,976
Sure he's to blame!

1150
01:11:24,079 --> 01:11:28,072
It is not fair that I have to take care
of his duties, while he's out there...

1151
01:11:28,150 --> 01:11:31,381
fooling around. Bastard!

1152
01:11:37,259 --> 01:11:39,352
When are you going to stop
being so miserable?

1153
01:11:39,461 --> 01:11:40,985
When you do the same.

1154
01:11:41,096 --> 01:11:42,154
Watch out your words!

1155
01:11:42,264 --> 01:11:44,027
Watch out your questions.

1156
01:11:44,300 --> 01:11:46,632
You're so tricky and shameless!

1157
01:11:46,735 --> 01:11:48,600
What a coincidence, I thoght
the same of you.

1158
01:11:48,704 --> 01:11:50,604
- What are you talking about?
- What are you talking about?

1159
01:11:50,706 --> 01:11:52,367
The music you played
Maria last night.

1160
01:11:52,441 --> 01:11:54,636
Do you realize the scandal
you've made?

1161
01:11:54,743 --> 01:11:56,335
A married man with children...

1162
01:11:56,445 --> 01:11:59,710
loving my sister and singing
a serenade in my own house?

1163
01:12:00,082 --> 01:12:01,549
Why do you make me
play the fool?

1164
01:12:01,617 --> 01:12:03,244
Don't talk that much!

1165
01:12:03,319 --> 01:12:05,879
Didn't you sing serenade
to my woman?

1166
01:12:06,355 --> 01:12:07,947
Well, that's different.

1167
01:12:08,023 --> 01:12:11,220
Sure it's different. Imagine
what they think of me.

1168
01:12:11,493 --> 01:12:14,587
When I left home this mornirng there
were some kids playing bullfight..

1169
01:12:14,663 --> 01:12:16,722
And one made fun out of me...

1170
01:12:16,799 --> 01:12:19,393
such a laugh that I
became suspicious.

1171
01:12:19,635 --> 01:12:22,502
If I'd known that you would react, I
wouln't have told you what I said-

1172
01:12:22,571 --> 01:12:26,371
I think you told me that
so I gave you the water.

1173
01:12:26,508 --> 01:12:28,999
- Do you think I'd do that?
- Sure!

1174
01:12:29,078 --> 01:12:31,546
You're so cunning and lazy!

1175
01:12:31,613 --> 01:12:34,912
Jorge, I'm tired
of your insults.

1176
01:12:34,983 --> 01:12:37,918
You made a coward out of me.

1177
01:12:38,120 --> 01:12:39,781
But that's it!

1178
01:12:39,922 --> 01:12:41,822
If you got something
against me...

1179
01:12:41,890 --> 01:12:45,155
let's knock the shit out
of us to kill ourselves!

1180
01:12:45,461 --> 01:12:47,395
- Are you so brave?
- Yeah.

1181
01:12:47,496 --> 01:12:50,124
- Come on.
- You first. Don't you have it in for me?

1182
01:12:50,232 --> 01:12:51,722
Come on, you idiot!

1183
01:13:16,358 --> 01:13:17,358
Take a look at this.

1184
01:13:27,503 --> 01:13:30,995
Can you see? You'll die by
hitting you with this rock.

1185
01:13:31,073 --> 01:13:34,042
- Go ahead now!
- I'm not that despicable!

1186
01:13:34,109 --> 01:13:36,373
I've already told you
that I can't kill you.

1187
01:13:36,478 --> 01:13:38,309
But I can.
Look!

1188
01:13:40,082 --> 01:13:43,108
You bastard! Would
you have shot me?

1189
01:13:43,352 --> 01:13:44,752
I would if you hit
me with the rock.

1190
01:13:45,154 --> 01:13:47,850
- What a bastard.
- Oh yeah.

1191
01:13:48,924 --> 01:13:49,924
Well.

1192
01:13:50,392 --> 01:13:51,791
Shall we continue
or shall we stop?

1193
01:13:51,860 --> 01:13:54,226
- As you wish.
- No, you decide.

1194
01:13:55,697 --> 01:13:56,823
Let's put an end to it.

1195
01:13:57,099 --> 01:13:59,260
Well. It's
alright.

1196
01:14:02,805 --> 01:14:04,602
Well, what we're here for...

1197
01:14:05,808 --> 01:14:08,208
I urgently need to
talk to Rosario.

1198
01:14:08,310 --> 01:14:09,538
It's not my business.

1199
01:14:09,611 --> 01:14:11,374
You've got to tell her.

1200
01:14:11,547 --> 01:14:15,313
One moment sir, we didn't agree
that I was going to procure her.

1201
01:14:15,417 --> 01:14:16,884
- No?
- Of course not!

1202
01:14:17,119 --> 01:14:20,350
We have the right to crawl,
but not that much.

1203
01:14:20,422 --> 01:14:21,616
Alright...

1204
01:14:21,824 --> 01:14:24,918
Just let me tell you that you won't have
water and you won't see Maria again.

1205
01:14:26,261 --> 01:14:27,728
Damn you!

1206
01:14:28,664 --> 01:14:29,961
When do you want to talk to her?

1207
01:14:30,065 --> 01:14:31,225
Tomorrow night.

1208
01:14:31,400 --> 01:14:33,197
- Where?
- In my place.

1209
01:14:33,268 --> 01:14:36,863
What! To take my woman
to your place? What...

1210
01:14:36,972 --> 01:14:38,599
Why not?

1211
01:14:38,674 --> 01:14:42,303
There's a party. I invite you
and you go with your wife.

1212
01:14:42,377 --> 01:14:44,038
It's the most common thing!

1213
01:14:44,213 --> 01:14:46,044
And what are we celebrating?

1214
01:14:46,982 --> 01:14:48,847
Tomorrow is the 23rd...

1215
01:14:49,585 --> 01:14:51,746
It's my birthday, don't
you remember?

1216
01:14:53,388 --> 01:14:55,185
Buddy! Congratulations.

1217
01:14:55,257 --> 01:14:57,782
- Thank you.
- I hope you die...

1218
01:14:57,893 --> 01:15:00,453
- What's up?
- I hope you die in many years.

1219
01:15:00,562 --> 01:15:02,029
You interrupted me.

1220
01:15:02,097 --> 01:15:03,792
Alright!

1221
01:15:04,566 --> 01:15:06,227
Girls, look who's coming.

1222
01:15:09,071 --> 01:15:10,698
How do you do, Pedrito?

1223
01:15:11,106 --> 01:15:12,471
How do you do, baby.

1224
01:15:12,674 --> 01:15:14,642
Is your wife fine?

1225
01:15:14,810 --> 01:15:16,471
She's fine, thanks.

1226
01:15:16,845 --> 01:15:19,439
And what about your
friend Jorge Bueno?

1227
01:15:20,916 --> 01:15:22,042
Is he good?

1228
01:15:24,553 --> 01:15:25,553
Well.

1229
01:15:33,128 --> 01:15:34,128
Pedro!

1230
01:15:34,730 --> 01:15:36,425
What's up General? What
are you doing here?

1231
01:15:36,498 --> 01:15:38,591
- Waiting for you.
- Here I am, please come in.

1232
01:15:39,434 --> 01:15:44,371
No, I'd rather stay here. It's
a very delicate matter.

1233
01:15:45,207 --> 01:15:48,768
You know that Jorge is
engaged to my daughter.

1234
01:15:48,877 --> 01:15:49,605
Yes sir.

1235
01:15:49,711 --> 01:15:52,043
You know that I made public
the engagement.

1236
01:15:52,147 --> 01:15:52,772
Yes sir.

1237
01:15:52,881 --> 01:15:55,645
And you know the banns
are being published.

1238
01:15:55,751 --> 01:15:56,547
Yes sir.

1239
01:15:56,618 --> 01:15:58,245
But what you don't know,

1240
01:15:58,353 --> 01:16:01,550
because in these matters the husband
is the last to know...

1241
01:16:01,723 --> 01:16:04,191
is that your great friend
Jorge Bueno...

1242
01:16:04,393 --> 01:16:06,020
has dishonoured you...

1243
01:16:06,128 --> 01:16:08,619
- Hey General.
- That's the word, sir!

1244
01:16:08,697 --> 01:16:12,724
Dishonoured!, because there's no
other way to name the fact...

1245
01:16:12,801 --> 01:16:15,201
that he sang a serenade
to your wife!

1246
01:16:15,771 --> 01:16:18,672
Shit! That was
really wrong!

1247
01:16:18,740 --> 01:16:20,708
Very bad done, General.

1248
01:16:21,376 --> 01:16:24,470
But since they were friend, maybe
it was just for friendship.

1249
01:16:24,546 --> 01:16:26,844
What friendship, like
hell you will!

1250
01:16:26,949 --> 01:16:28,974
He shouted at her
like a mad man...

1251
01:16:29,084 --> 01:16:32,417
I love you, I love you. Everyone
in the neighbourhood heard him.

1252
01:16:32,654 --> 01:16:33,654
What a shame!

1253
01:16:34,089 --> 01:16:36,284
Imagine my daughter's state.

1254
01:16:36,925 --> 01:16:40,383
To have such an offense on
the verge of the wedding!

1255
01:16:40,696 --> 01:16:42,994
She's been humiliated,
deceived and vilified.

1256
01:16:43,065 --> 01:16:45,033
It's like being kicked
in the teeth!

1257
01:16:46,034 --> 01:16:47,365
Well, general..

1258
01:16:48,170 --> 01:16:51,503
You know a man like me has
no other way but the arms.

1259
01:16:51,740 --> 01:16:55,232
I picked up my gun and I was ready
to wash the infamy with blood.

1260
01:16:55,844 --> 01:16:58,142
But thinking about it carefully,
I concluded...

1261
01:16:58,547 --> 01:17:00,412
That I shouldn't shoot Jorge.

1262
01:17:01,450 --> 01:17:04,010
That's a wise decision, General.
It doesn't worth it.

1263
01:17:04,086 --> 01:17:06,077
I'm not going to shoot him.

1264
01:17:06,288 --> 01:17:07,550
You will!

1265
01:17:07,623 --> 01:17:09,557
- Me?
- Of course!

1266
01:17:09,625 --> 01:17:11,593
Even though I'm deeply
offended...

1267
01:17:11,760 --> 01:17:15,958
I admit the sacred right to punish
that miserable belongs to you...

1268
01:17:16,331 --> 01:17:18,856
- You're right, I'm going to kill him!
- Right!

1269
01:17:18,934 --> 01:17:21,266
He's going to have
the worst death.

1270
01:17:21,536 --> 01:17:23,367
- Civil death.
- What?

1271
01:17:24,172 --> 01:17:27,938
In these matters oblivion is the best
thing, General. Please excuse me.

1272
01:17:28,010 --> 01:17:30,478
No sir! That's no
men's attitude.

1273
01:17:30,545 --> 01:17:32,513
- No?
- It's of cowards.

1274
01:17:32,748 --> 01:17:34,739
- Yes.
- And you're not a coward.

1275
01:17:35,217 --> 01:17:36,878
- No.
- Then, kill him!

1276
01:17:37,386 --> 01:17:40,082
That's the only honourable
way left!

1277
01:17:40,722 --> 01:17:41,722
Yes sir.

1278
01:17:41,790 --> 01:17:43,485
It's the only one.

1279
01:17:43,725 --> 01:17:45,920
Jorge surely dies!

1280
01:17:46,328 --> 01:17:48,193
- See you later, General.
- Where do you think you're going?

1281
01:17:48,296 --> 01:17:49,661
I'm going to take a shower.

1282
01:17:49,731 --> 01:17:53,167
No my friend, you must clean
your honour first...

1283
01:17:53,235 --> 01:17:56,534
and then you take whatever
you want. Let's go

1284
01:18:07,516 --> 01:18:08,516
Genoveva,

1285
01:18:08,550 --> 01:18:12,987
I think you know about that serenade
everybody's talking in town...

1286
01:18:13,088 --> 01:18:16,649
and I must explain my
behaviour telling you frankly

1287
01:18:16,758 --> 01:18:19,921
that when I asked for your hand I
sincerly believed that I was cured...

1288
01:18:20,028 --> 01:18:22,588
from an illness that
deeply affected me...

1289
01:18:22,664 --> 01:18:26,964
Unfortunately that illness has
struck me again so seriously...

1290
01:18:27,069 --> 01:18:32,200
that I think it has no cure.
I think you know it's name.

1291
01:18:32,307 --> 01:18:35,640
I don't want to offend
you repeating it.

1292
01:18:37,679 --> 01:18:40,443
General, would you excuse me?
I'll be back in a moment.

1293
01:18:40,549 --> 01:18:42,574
- Where are you going?
- I'm going er...

1294
01:18:42,684 --> 01:18:45,016
- To pick up my gun.
- There's no need.

1295
01:18:45,120 --> 01:18:47,452
Here's mine.
Take it.

1296
01:18:47,556 --> 01:18:49,080
- I can't accept!
- Why?

1297
01:18:49,157 --> 01:18:50,818
- I implicate you.
- It's best.

1298
01:18:50,892 --> 01:18:53,417
It's going to be a
joint revenge...

1299
01:18:53,495 --> 01:18:57,397
You'll pull the trigger and my
bullets will kill him. Take it!

1300
01:18:58,033 --> 01:19:00,593
Well, we'll take joint revenge.

1301
01:19:02,871 --> 01:19:06,466
By the way, do you want some
soda, General, I'm thristy.

1302
01:19:06,575 --> 01:19:09,908
I'm also thisty, but
of revenge. Let's go!

1303
01:19:10,112 --> 01:19:14,446
I'm not worried because I think your
father will understand and even say.

1304
01:19:15,350 --> 01:19:18,877
Don't worry, Jorgito,
it happens to all men.

1305
01:19:18,987 --> 01:19:24,050
He'll hold my hand as usual,
and he'll invite me to drink.

1306
01:19:24,893 --> 01:19:26,918
Yes sir, Jorge is at
the Post Office.

1307
01:19:27,028 --> 01:19:30,623
- Hurry up!
- General, shouldn't we think it twice?

1308
01:19:30,732 --> 01:19:33,860
It's been analized and solved,
the offender will die!

1309
01:19:33,969 --> 01:19:36,437
Well, and if there
is another guilty?

1310
01:19:36,538 --> 01:19:39,405
How can it be? Do you have
doubts about your wife?

1311
01:19:39,508 --> 01:19:41,601
- Oh no, not at all.
- Then?

1312
01:19:41,943 --> 01:19:45,936
Maybe I was wrong. Jorge
did it with my approval.

1313
01:19:46,014 --> 01:19:48,608
- No.
- Yes.

1314
01:19:48,717 --> 01:19:52,312
Then, the first who's gonna die
it's you, for being yielded!

1315
01:19:52,387 --> 01:19:55,254
- Give me my gun back.
- Please wait, General. Let me explain.

1316
01:19:55,357 --> 01:19:58,622
- There was a reason.
- I'm waiting to hear.

1317
01:19:58,727 --> 01:20:00,991
- Why do I tell you, you won't beleive.
- Come on!

1318
01:20:01,096 --> 01:20:04,361
- It was to save Genoveva.
- My daughter?

1319
01:20:04,466 --> 01:20:06,525
- From what?
- Of getting married to Jorge.

1320
01:20:06,635 --> 01:20:10,002
- It's not for her.
- And what is your business here?

1321
01:20:10,105 --> 01:20:12,869
Because my affection is great,
for her and for you...

1322
01:20:12,974 --> 01:20:15,033
and I had to prevent her
to marry Jorge somehow.

1323
01:20:15,143 --> 01:20:18,374
- But why?
- Because he's...

1324
01:20:18,480 --> 01:20:22,075
- got some kind of illness.
- And illness can be cured. Let's go!

1325
01:20:22,150 --> 01:20:23,981
- Not this one!
- How can you know!

1326
01:20:24,085 --> 01:20:26,883
Science's advanced, and there
are medicines for everything.

1327
01:20:26,955 --> 01:20:30,118
This one can't be cured.
You've got to beleive me.

1328
01:20:30,192 --> 01:20:33,650
Well, if it is a leprosy,
or something like that.

1329
01:20:33,728 --> 01:20:36,959
You've got it! It's not leprosy,
but someting as bad.

1330
01:20:41,670 --> 01:20:43,228
- No...
- Yes.

1331
01:20:43,471 --> 01:20:46,668
Imagine the disgrace for your
daughter and for you.

1332
01:20:46,775 --> 01:20:49,744
Having grandchildren ill-
fated, hunchback..

1333
01:20:49,811 --> 01:20:52,678
Without eyes, or a head this size.

1334
01:20:52,747 --> 01:20:55,079
No, what an atrocity.

1335
01:20:55,283 --> 01:20:59,185
Who would have thought that
on a healthy looking guy.

1336
01:20:59,287 --> 01:21:02,848
It's what he inherited from
his carousing father.

1337
01:21:02,924 --> 01:21:05,415
Well, and what does it have
to do with the serenade?

1338
01:21:05,493 --> 01:21:09,429
Everything! Jorge had kept the secret
and thought to be cured...

1339
01:21:09,531 --> 01:21:13,160
but after the engagement to Genoveva,
he realized that he was ill again...

1340
01:21:13,235 --> 01:21:15,635
and what to do? To tell
you about it? Never!

1341
01:21:15,704 --> 01:21:17,638
You should talk about these things
only to a physician...

1342
01:21:17,706 --> 01:21:22,040
then what to do? To imagine an
affair to dissapoint Genoveva.

1343
01:21:22,143 --> 01:21:24,839
What woman would do
the favor, General?

1344
01:21:24,913 --> 01:21:28,940
Only a friend. We talked to my wife
and Jorge sang the serenade...

1345
01:21:29,050 --> 01:21:30,813
and you know the rest
of the story...

1346
01:21:30,919 --> 01:21:36,152
I see. It was strange taht you
defend the lover of your wife.

1347
01:21:36,224 --> 01:21:38,215
- Of course.
- Yeah, everything is clear now.

1348
01:21:38,326 --> 01:21:40,521
But not the disease.
I don't beleive it!

1349
01:21:40,595 --> 01:21:42,995
- Hey General.
- Let's talk to Jorge!

1350
01:21:43,064 --> 01:21:45,726
- Why do we need to embarrass him?
- Let him get embarrassed!

1351
01:21:45,834 --> 01:21:47,825
I have to clear up this matter.

1352
01:21:47,903 --> 01:21:50,701
And if it is not true this story
about the incurable disease...

1353
01:21:50,772 --> 01:21:53,832
I swear on my father's ashes
an my militar honour

1354
01:21:53,942 --> 01:21:56,137
that I'll shoot you like
a dog. Let's go!

1355
01:22:00,181 --> 01:22:01,181
Jorge!

1356
01:22:04,052 --> 01:22:06,247
I'm here to speak as men do.

1357
01:22:07,289 --> 01:22:09,951
Here I am, General.
What's all about?

1358
01:22:10,125 --> 01:22:12,184
It's about an illness that...

1359
01:22:12,294 --> 01:22:14,091
Well, we have to be clear.

1360
01:22:14,195 --> 01:22:17,255
- Of that disease that you have!
- My disease?

1361
01:22:17,332 --> 01:22:19,562
At least that's what
your friend said.

1362
01:22:19,968 --> 01:22:21,833
And why are you talking
about what you shouldn't?

1363
01:22:21,903 --> 01:22:23,029
I demanded it.

1364
01:22:25,173 --> 01:22:29,303
Well General, in the end I had
to talk about it with you.

1365
01:22:29,411 --> 01:22:33,404
There is the first contradiction. You
said he wouldn't talk to me about it.

1366
01:22:33,515 --> 01:22:35,346
Well, he's changed his mind.

1367
01:22:35,684 --> 01:22:38,175
Well, besides you would
have known by this.

1368
01:22:38,286 --> 01:22:40,948
Letter to Genoveva where
I explain everything.

1369
01:22:41,022 --> 01:22:43,718
- May I read it?
- Yes, why not?

1370
01:22:43,825 --> 01:22:47,522
Hey General, I think it's no good
to learn what friends write.

1371
01:22:47,629 --> 01:22:48,960
Silence!

1372
01:22:53,335 --> 01:22:58,432
I think you know about that serenade
everybody's talking in town

1373
01:22:58,506 --> 01:23:00,474
and I must explain...

1374
01:23:00,942 --> 01:23:05,504
When I asked for your hand I sincerly
thought I was cured from a disease...

1375
01:23:05,613 --> 01:23:07,843
that depply affected me.

1376
01:23:11,786 --> 01:23:15,654
Unfortunately that illness has
struck me again so seriously...

1377
01:23:15,757 --> 01:23:22,060
that I think it has no cure.
I think you know it's name.

1378
01:23:22,163 --> 01:23:24,529
I don't want to offend
you by repeating it.

1379
01:23:24,632 --> 01:23:27,226
No, my daughter musn't
know this.

1380
01:23:27,302 --> 01:23:30,931
She had to know someday.
Maybe she knows it.

1381
01:23:31,039 --> 01:23:33,906
You're so cool about this
embarrassing matter!

1382
01:23:34,009 --> 01:23:36,529
But this is something that happens
to everybody sonner or later.

1383
01:23:36,678 --> 01:23:39,943
General, haven't you been
in such situation?

1384
01:23:40,048 --> 01:23:42,243
Heaven forbid! I'd
rather shot myself!

1385
01:23:42,317 --> 01:23:44,877
General, that's what one says...

1386
01:23:44,953 --> 01:23:47,888
but in the end there's
no shooting, and

1387
01:23:47,989 --> 01:23:51,447
you stay there. It's true
that it makes suffer.

1388
01:23:51,526 --> 01:23:54,723
But when it works, you enjoy it!

1389
01:23:54,796 --> 01:24:00,359
- So you like your disease.
- Yes sir, a lot!

1390
01:24:01,870 --> 01:24:04,361
There is no accountog
for tastes, general.

1391
01:24:04,439 --> 01:24:06,600
You shouldn't speak,
your're like me.

1392
01:24:07,509 --> 01:24:11,445
- You too?
- But I'm not as sick as him.

1393
01:24:12,414 --> 01:24:14,439
God, the world is upside down.

1394
01:24:14,649 --> 01:24:17,209
Do you have a good physician?

1395
01:24:17,318 --> 01:24:20,344
A physician?
No, General.

1396
01:24:20,488 --> 01:24:22,353
These things are not for doctors.

1397
01:24:22,424 --> 01:24:25,154
Either they go by themselves
or they distroy you.

1398
01:24:25,260 --> 01:24:28,286
I don't understand how
can you be resigned.

1399
01:24:28,363 --> 01:24:32,231
How can't it be. Since I was
a kid I have it in my heart.

1400
01:24:32,333 --> 01:24:33,800
You mean in your blood.

1401
01:24:33,868 --> 01:24:37,804
In my heart, blood, soul,
even in my bone marrow.

1402
01:24:37,906 --> 01:24:41,239
You're right. He's
in the final stage.

1403
01:24:41,810 --> 01:24:45,041
But if in spite of all this you
demand that I keep my word...

1404
01:24:45,146 --> 01:24:46,636
I marry your daughter.

1405
01:24:46,714 --> 01:24:51,617
No, no, no. There's no need to
disgrace innocent people...

1406
01:24:51,719 --> 01:24:56,486
ill-fated, hunchback, without
eyes and bigheaded kids.

1407
01:24:56,724 --> 01:24:59,386
Give me your word that you will
never think about my daughter.

1408
01:25:00,295 --> 01:25:02,661
Well, I promise, General.

1409
01:25:03,198 --> 01:25:06,531
Keep up with your plan with Rosario.
I'll make sure that Genoveva will see it.

1410
01:25:06,634 --> 01:25:10,502
I'll take her to your party. There
you can be a little shameless

1411
01:25:10,572 --> 01:25:13,234
so she'll be disappointed, and
I'll have no hard feelings,

1412
01:25:13,308 --> 01:25:17,506
On the contrary, I'll
be very grateful.

1413
01:25:21,015 --> 01:25:23,449
Hey! Why didn't he
shake my hand?

1414
01:25:23,551 --> 01:25:26,349
- Don't push it, buddy don't push it!
- You've got to explain everything!

1415
01:25:26,421 --> 01:25:29,515
Hey man, please, I'll
explain everything.

1416
01:25:31,559 --> 01:25:34,790
Then what, please say
yes, Chayito, please.

1417
01:25:34,896 --> 01:25:37,763
It's clear, Jorge handles
you like a puppet.

1418
01:25:37,832 --> 01:25:43,566
It's like you had a ring in the nose,
and pulls as you pull a, a...

1419
01:25:44,105 --> 01:25:46,369
- A bull?
- Or an ox, it's the same.

1420
01:25:46,441 --> 01:25:49,774
- Chill out, don't be so evil minded.
- You innocent!

1421
01:25:49,844 --> 01:25:53,940
He wants you have another woman, so
I could cheat you with him. He said so!

1422
01:25:54,015 --> 01:25:58,008
And listen, I could cheat you with
every man, but never with Jorge!

1423
01:25:58,119 --> 01:25:59,177
Every man?

1424
01:25:59,888 --> 01:26:02,379
Wll, I meant no-one, and
even less with Jorge

1425
01:26:02,490 --> 01:26:06,551
I only want to make peace, so we
can be friends as we used to...

1426
01:26:06,628 --> 01:26:10,496
- Yes...
- Come on Chayito, please me.

1427
01:26:10,899 --> 01:26:11,899
No!

1428
01:26:18,740 --> 01:26:23,200
Well alright, I'll go to his
party, but I don't want to.

1429
01:26:31,019 --> 01:26:32,145
Shit!

1430
01:26:33,688 --> 01:26:35,713
Hurry up, you're going
to be late to the party.

1431
01:26:35,790 --> 01:26:38,088
Wait, I've got to lock the car.

1432
01:26:38,159 --> 01:26:41,151
Because everyone is honest,
but you never know.

1433
01:26:41,262 --> 01:26:46,825
Hey girl, here comes Mrs. mmm,
mmm's wife and his father.

1434
01:26:46,935 --> 01:26:49,199
Who are mmm and mmmm?

1435
01:26:49,304 --> 01:26:53,070
Those who can't be named
in this house.

1436
01:26:57,011 --> 01:26:58,638
Mmmm.

1437
01:26:58,713 --> 01:27:01,546
Rosario and Pedro are here,
what are we going to do?

1438
01:27:01,616 --> 01:27:03,675
To serve them.
I invited them.

1439
01:27:03,818 --> 01:27:04,818
Jorge!

1440
01:27:07,222 --> 01:27:10,885
They say they're going
to close my paths...

1441
01:27:10,992 --> 01:27:12,857
They could close the paths.

1442
01:27:12,961 --> 01:27:15,953
But my love.
..when?

1443
01:27:16,030 --> 01:27:18,328
- What's up Jorge.
- What's up buddy.

1444
01:27:18,967 --> 01:27:20,958
- Congratulations buddy.
- Thanks buddy.

1445
01:27:21,069 --> 01:27:22,969
Hey buddy, it was very
hard to convince her

1446
01:27:23,037 --> 01:27:25,062
but there she is. Don't
exceed yourself.

1447
01:27:25,139 --> 01:27:27,471
- No, buddy, me?
- What did you tell Maria about me?

1448
01:27:27,542 --> 01:27:30,534
Nothing came to my mind. Let's
see how you can fix it.

1449
01:27:30,612 --> 01:27:32,307
What do I have to tell her?

1450
01:27:32,814 --> 01:27:36,215
- Go talk my sister, we'll see if it works.
- Ok.

1451
01:27:38,186 --> 01:27:42,623
- Congratulations Mr Jorgito.
- Thaks Mr. Elias. You look very happy.

1452
01:27:42,724 --> 01:27:48,287
Yes. Today is the first time my son-in-
law is taking his wife to a party.

1453
01:27:48,396 --> 01:27:51,854
Listen, do you promise
no to get drunk?

1454
01:27:51,933 --> 01:27:54,299
- Sure Mr. Elias.
- Ok.

1455
01:27:54,569 --> 01:27:56,264
Congratulations Jorge.

1456
01:27:57,272 --> 01:28:01,038
This far? What about
a hug to your friend.

1457
01:28:02,410 --> 01:28:03,410
Why not?

1458
01:28:08,583 --> 01:28:12,917
Don't start, don't exceed.
Behave well, please.

1459
01:28:12,987 --> 01:28:15,046
Chill out, Mr. Elias.

1460
01:28:15,123 --> 01:28:16,123
Marujita.

1461
01:28:20,028 --> 01:28:23,122
I just want to tell you that Periquito
can't fly any longer.

1462
01:28:23,197 --> 01:28:25,165
- Really?
- Yeah.

1463
01:28:25,967 --> 01:28:29,528
Since I never earn your love,
I want your friendship.

1464
01:28:32,874 --> 01:28:35,502
I made peace with Jorge. Now
I want peace with you.

1465
01:28:36,811 --> 01:28:38,711
We're in peace.

1466
01:28:40,782 --> 01:28:43,080
Do you want to dance
with your new friend?

1467
01:28:43,785 --> 01:28:44,785
Why not?

1468
01:28:50,892 --> 01:28:52,621
I just want to ask
you something.

1469
01:28:53,995 --> 01:28:55,553
Have you ever loved me?

1470
01:28:55,697 --> 01:28:56,755
Are you starting again?

1471
01:28:56,864 --> 01:28:58,798
No, it's only curiosity.

1472
01:28:59,400 --> 01:29:01,129
Did you ever love me?

1473
01:29:02,036 --> 01:29:04,129
I don't have to answer.

1474
01:29:10,945 --> 01:29:15,109
Mr. Elias, would you like to eat a
sandwich, a taco, do you want a soda?

1475
01:29:15,216 --> 01:29:17,446
No thanks, I'm not hungry.

1476
01:29:21,022 --> 01:29:22,022
Rosario...

1477
01:29:23,991 --> 01:29:26,687
- Do you want to dance?
- Yes Jorge.

1478
01:29:36,404 --> 01:29:38,702
- I've got to talk of an urgent matter.
- Listen Jorge...

1479
01:29:38,806 --> 01:29:41,400
Please don't interrupt.
If you're going to speak about...

1480
01:29:41,476 --> 01:29:43,444
what I think, it's better
to keep quiet.

1481
01:30:01,462 --> 01:30:02,952
I'm only asking to be heard.

1482
01:30:03,064 --> 01:30:06,465
Jorge, if I came is because Pedro told
me that you wanted to make peace.

1483
01:30:06,567 --> 01:30:08,467
- Let's be good friends.
- No!

1484
01:30:08,569 --> 01:30:11,834
If you love like I love you, we've
got to be more than friends.

1485
01:30:11,939 --> 01:30:14,931
- What do you mean?
- I talked to Pedro...

1486
01:30:27,755 --> 01:30:28,881
Pedro told me everything.

1487
01:30:30,324 --> 01:30:31,324
Everything.

1488
01:30:32,493 --> 01:30:33,755
But I don't care.

1489
01:30:34,395 --> 01:30:38,764
You marry me and I'll love your
daughter as if she were mine.

1490
01:30:38,833 --> 01:30:40,801
It's up to you.

1491
01:30:42,136 --> 01:30:45,572
It cannot be. Imagine
the scandal in town.

1492
01:30:45,640 --> 01:30:48,336
- We clear off!
- Your mother wouldn't allow it.

1493
01:30:48,443 --> 01:30:52,675
- I convince her.
- No Jorge, how would be our life?

1494
01:30:52,780 --> 01:30:56,409
- And your sister's hate.
- We'll work that out immediately!

1495
01:30:56,517 --> 01:31:00,317
- You talk to her and tell her everything.
- That's impossible, I don't dare.

1496
01:31:00,822 --> 01:31:03,791
- You tell her or I will.
- No Jorge, please.

1497
01:31:03,858 --> 01:31:04,950
Of course!

1498
01:31:07,061 --> 01:31:10,030
Well, since you want to know
it so bad, I'll tell you...

1499
01:31:11,399 --> 01:31:12,832
yes, I loved you.

1500
01:31:14,335 --> 01:31:16,428
When you got married
I suffered so much.

1501
01:31:17,138 --> 01:31:19,299
You can't imagine how I cried.

1502
01:31:19,974 --> 01:31:22,499
Then, why did you denied it?

1503
01:31:23,144 --> 01:31:26,978
Because I didn't want to share your
love with all those girlies.

1504
01:31:28,249 --> 01:31:30,217
You know how women are..

1505
01:31:30,318 --> 01:31:34,618
I thought you love me very little, I was
forcing you to love me more and...

1506
01:31:34,689 --> 01:31:36,350
And you forced it that much
that it couldn't resist...

1507
01:31:36,457 --> 01:31:40,689
- No, you couldn't resist.
- But we're in time to fix it.

1508
01:31:40,761 --> 01:31:43,025
Do you want to fix it?

1509
01:31:43,297 --> 01:31:47,927
No, I'm not destroying a family,
and less if there are children.

1510
01:31:48,002 --> 01:31:52,234
Children. She's only
one little girl.

1511
01:31:54,408 --> 01:31:57,741
- Maria! Rosario wants to talk to you.
- I don't want to.

1512
01:31:57,845 --> 01:31:58,971
But I do.

1513
01:31:59,714 --> 01:32:01,511
Jorge, please.

1514
01:32:06,754 --> 01:32:08,619
Desperate ills call for
desperate measures.

1515
01:32:10,191 --> 01:32:13,957
- Do you want a drink?
- A drink for this anger.

1516
01:32:14,795 --> 01:32:18,128
We've got to take advantage of my
mother's absence, and go to the city.

1517
01:32:18,232 --> 01:32:19,130
And from there?

1518
01:32:19,200 --> 01:32:21,191
You get divorced, I got married,
you got married and...

1519
01:32:21,302 --> 01:32:23,270
We go to the United States!

1520
01:32:23,604 --> 01:32:26,596
And if general discovers that we
fooled him with your disease.

1521
01:32:26,674 --> 01:32:27,902
No buddy. How
can he know?

1522
01:32:27,975 --> 01:32:30,466
Talk to the doctor. I know
he's looking for him.

1523
01:32:30,545 --> 01:32:33,776
We've got to go before
the fair time arrives!

1524
01:32:33,881 --> 01:32:35,348
And you, silence.

1525
01:32:35,449 --> 01:32:37,417
- Sure.
- Ok.

1526
01:32:45,660 --> 01:32:49,289
I think this is not going
to work. I feel strange.

1527
01:32:49,397 --> 01:32:53,094
No buddy, you've got
to be optimistic.

1528
01:32:56,404 --> 01:33:00,636
- What are they looking at my head?
- Your head?

1529
01:33:03,578 --> 01:33:08,277
God! This outfit
goes after me!

1530
01:33:08,616 --> 01:33:10,846
- Hey Pedro.
- I want to talk to you. Excuse me.

1531
01:33:10,918 --> 01:33:12,749
- What happens uncle?
- I'm not your uncle.

1532
01:33:12,820 --> 01:33:15,755
Take your woman, we're
leaving right away.

1533
01:33:15,823 --> 01:33:16,482
But why?

1534
01:33:16,557 --> 01:33:19,492
Because I'm ashamed.
Don't you realize?

1535
01:33:19,560 --> 01:33:21,585
While your dancing
with Maria Jorge is

1536
01:33:21,696 --> 01:33:23,721
courting your woman,
isn't that enough?

1537
01:33:23,831 --> 01:33:27,597
Uncle, there certain things that
can't explained to you...

1538
01:33:27,702 --> 01:33:29,636
What the hell, he told
me the same thing.

1539
01:33:29,737 --> 01:33:33,264
- What happens, Mr. Elias?
- It happens that I'm tired of...

1540
01:33:33,374 --> 01:33:37,174
of your bad bahavior with my daughter.
I'm taking her right away!

1541
01:33:37,244 --> 01:33:39,235
Please keep cool.

1542
01:33:39,313 --> 01:33:43,511
Let's go somewhere else that we're
telling you the whole truth.

1543
01:33:43,584 --> 01:33:48,112
- The truth? Is there something wrong?
- No, please come.

1544
01:33:48,222 --> 01:33:51,658
You're going to tell me everything.
Why do bring me here?

1545
01:33:51,759 --> 01:33:56,196
- Sit here.
- Please tell me the whole truth,

1546
01:33:56,297 --> 01:33:57,696
tell me at once what's
all about.

1547
01:33:57,765 --> 01:33:59,699
- Can you see that hole in there?
- Yes.

1548
01:33:59,767 --> 01:34:00,426
- Sure?
- Yes,

1549
01:34:00,501 --> 01:34:03,231
- You don't fit there.
- Listen to me!

1550
01:34:03,304 --> 01:34:07,263
Listen to me, you bastad,
why do you bring me here!

1551
01:34:11,012 --> 01:34:12,036
Hell!

1552
01:34:12,146 --> 01:34:14,979
The General will arrive anytime. If
he speaks to him, we're in hell.

1553
01:34:15,049 --> 01:34:17,847
- We've got to get rid of him.
- I'll fix it.

1554
01:34:17,952 --> 01:34:21,854
- Jorge, Jorgito.
- How do you do doctor, are you fine?

1555
01:34:21,922 --> 01:34:27,383
I was resting in Guadalajara, when
I remebered it was your birthday.

1556
01:34:27,461 --> 01:34:30,362
- I came very fast!
- Didn't you have problems on the way?

1557
01:34:30,464 --> 01:34:32,625
Not at all, in spite
of the speed!

1558
01:34:32,733 --> 01:34:35,429
- How are you?
- Sweating, doctor.

1559
01:34:35,536 --> 01:34:37,527
- The heat?
- No, but I'm sweating.

1560
01:34:37,638 --> 01:34:39,868
- Because of today's excitement!
- It must be.

1561
01:34:39,974 --> 01:34:42,704
Doctor, please go quick
to Santa Fe ranch,

1562
01:34:42,810 --> 01:34:46,405
a horse fell on the steward
and he's dying!

1563
01:34:46,514 --> 01:34:51,315
I tell you, I just have arrived and I
must go to do some emegency healing!

1564
01:34:51,385 --> 01:34:54,718
Go on and carry out your duty.

1565
01:34:57,825 --> 01:35:00,123
- Doctor, I found you at least!
- How do you do, General.

1566
01:35:00,194 --> 01:35:03,925
- Very bad, and I'm offended!
- Why is that?

1567
01:35:03,998 --> 01:35:06,728
Because you didn't tell me
about what you know...

1568
01:35:06,801 --> 01:35:10,328
I mean, professional secrecy
must be kept behind.

1569
01:35:10,404 --> 01:35:13,032
What are you talking
about, what secret?

1570
01:35:13,107 --> 01:35:16,508
- Come so we can speak.
- No I can't. I must go..

1571
01:35:16,577 --> 01:35:20,445
- The wounded is dying, doctor.
- You see, General. See you later.

1572
01:35:27,888 --> 01:35:32,154
- Hi General, nice to see you.
- I'm very upset!

1573
01:35:32,259 --> 01:35:33,259
Why General?

1574
01:35:34,428 --> 01:35:36,828
Are you asking yet? Genoveva
didn't want to come...

1575
01:35:36,897 --> 01:35:40,663
but I managed to convince her.
I came ahead to make a plan.

1576
01:35:40,735 --> 01:35:43,203
She wants to hear your explanation,
but we must avoid that.

1577
01:35:43,304 --> 01:35:44,984
Desperate ills call for
desperate measures.

1578
01:35:45,039 --> 01:35:46,597
What do you want to do?

1579
01:35:46,707 --> 01:35:52,077
To attack! When she arrives, let
her see you very close to...

1580
01:35:52,146 --> 01:35:53,704
this sir's wife.

1581
01:35:53,814 --> 01:35:58,547
- And that's it. So let's get started.
- Don't worry General, I'm coming.

1582
01:35:59,920 --> 01:36:04,687
I value all that you do for your
friend, and thanks for my part.

1583
01:36:04,759 --> 01:36:06,659
You're welcome, General.

1584
01:36:06,761 --> 01:36:09,924
Very generous your action.

1585
01:36:10,397 --> 01:36:13,127
But there's a gossip about you!

1586
01:36:14,535 --> 01:36:17,504
I advise you to leave the
town as soon as possible.

1587
01:36:17,605 --> 01:36:20,597
We have thought
that. Excuse me.

1588
01:36:23,344 --> 01:36:26,575
I've got to go out of here,
even at my life's expense!

1589
01:36:26,680 --> 01:36:30,514
Bastards! Open,
open.

1590
01:36:41,862 --> 01:36:44,660
I'm still thinking that
you're two shameless!

1591
01:36:45,399 --> 01:36:46,991
But very generous.

1592
01:36:48,235 --> 01:36:49,235
Pedro...

1593
01:36:49,804 --> 01:36:52,170
I retract half of
what I said to you

1594
01:36:53,007 --> 01:36:55,168
but we talk the other
half later...

1595
01:36:55,409 --> 01:36:57,104
- Brother..
- Mmm.

1596
01:36:57,178 --> 01:37:02,377
I'm pride of your big heart.
You know how to love.

1597
01:37:02,449 --> 01:37:05,907
My daughter has arrived. Dance
or do something, but do it!

1598
01:37:05,986 --> 01:37:07,977
We dance!

1599
01:37:28,108 --> 01:37:32,272
- Come my girl, please come.
- No please.

1600
01:37:32,379 --> 01:37:36,338
Take me out! At least they open!
I'm going to see that bastard.

1601
01:37:40,921 --> 01:37:44,618
- Disobedient children!
- What happens Mr. Elias.

1602
01:37:44,692 --> 01:37:46,091
General, come this way.

1603
01:37:47,194 --> 01:37:49,287
- Please lend me your gun.
- What for?

1604
01:37:49,363 --> 01:37:51,695
To see if Jorge respects me.

1605
01:37:51,765 --> 01:37:54,233
Look at him, dancing cheek
to cheek with my daughter.

1606
01:37:56,036 --> 01:37:59,631
- I'll kill that bastard!
- Easy, don't spoil the plan.

1607
01:37:59,707 --> 01:38:03,006
- What plan?
- There are things that can't be said.

1608
01:38:03,077 --> 01:38:04,601
- You too?
- Me too what?

1609
01:38:04,712 --> 01:38:06,272
It seems that you have
an understanding.

1610
01:38:06,347 --> 01:38:08,679
Sure. The four of us have
an understanding.

1611
01:38:08,749 --> 01:38:12,310
I'm going to explain, look.

1612
01:38:13,187 --> 01:38:14,677
- Excuse me.
- You're welcome.

1613
01:38:15,089 --> 01:38:15,487
Hey,

1614
01:38:15,556 --> 01:38:18,150
Aren't you Pantaleon,
Santa Fe's steward?

1615
01:38:18,259 --> 01:38:18,782
Yes sir.

1616
01:38:18,859 --> 01:38:20,918
Weren't you dying because
a horse fell on you?

1617
01:38:20,995 --> 01:38:23,259
Hey doctor, someone joke on you.

1618
01:38:23,330 --> 01:38:26,891
What a funny joke!
Get back.

1619
01:38:26,967 --> 01:38:29,731
If someone looks for me,
I'm at Jorge Bueno's.

1620
01:38:30,437 --> 01:38:34,430
<i>What a hapiness to have
you like that...</i>

1621
01:38:34,541 --> 01:38:38,739
<i>my darling</i>

1622
01:38:38,913 --> 01:38:45,819
<i>feeling the beat of your heart</i>

1623
01:38:47,621 --> 01:38:54,151

1624
01:38:55,963 --> 01:39:01,993
<i>burning myself in your look.</i>

1625
01:39:03,871 --> 01:39:10,936
<i>There are people who die from pain</i>

1626
01:39:12,746 --> 01:39:19,174
<i>jelous for not being in love</i>

1627
01:39:20,988 --> 01:39:25,186
<i>it doesn't matter that people</i>

1628
01:39:25,292 --> 01:39:28,784
<i>if God has brought you to me.</i>

1629
01:39:28,862 --> 01:39:35,461
<i>God's will be done.</i>

1630
01:39:37,871 --> 01:39:41,830
<i>What a hapiness to have
you like that...</i>

1631
01:39:41,909 --> 01:39:44,810
<i>my darling</i>

1632
01:39:46,213 --> 01:39:53,016

<i>burning myself in your look...</i>

1635
01:40:07,701 --> 01:40:11,228
Dad, give him back his ring,
I want nothing from him!

1636
01:40:12,406 --> 01:40:14,636
My daughter, Genoveva, wait...

1637
01:40:15,642 --> 01:40:18,543
<i>die..</i>

1638
01:40:19,780 --> 01:40:26,310
<i>Jelous for not being in love</i>

1639
01:40:28,155 --> 01:40:32,023

01:40:32,092 --> 01:40:35,926

1641
01:40:36,530 --> 01:40:44,530
<i>God's will be done.</i>

1642
01:40:47,441 --> 01:40:49,602
Dinner is served!

1643
01:40:57,651 --> 01:41:00,586
Mr. Elias, it's time
to speak honestly.

1644
01:41:00,721 --> 01:41:03,656
Don't worry to explain, Jorgito,
I'm not that dumb

1645
01:41:03,724 --> 01:41:06,852
I know that is for
everybody's good.

1646
01:41:06,960 --> 01:41:12,796
Everything turned out as planned.
Here is your engagement. Goodbye.

1647
01:41:15,335 --> 01:41:18,600
Good heavens! Why do you say
that everything's over?

1648
01:41:18,672 --> 01:41:23,507
Because he has humiliated me,
ridiculized me, with a married woman.

1649
01:41:23,577 --> 01:41:27,172
Married? He inherited that
from his father, I'm sure.

1650
01:41:27,281 --> 01:41:29,909
Many problems with married women
I had with my deceased husband.

1651
01:41:31,385 --> 01:41:33,080
No my son, please
explain. The.

1652
01:41:33,153 --> 01:41:35,417
General says that everything
is because...

1653
01:41:35,522 --> 01:41:38,719
he doesn't want the children of Genoveva
to receive that heredity..

1654
01:41:38,826 --> 01:41:42,023
What heredity and whose are
the children of Genoveva?

1655
01:41:42,129 --> 01:41:43,528
But Jorge's!

1656
01:41:43,597 --> 01:41:45,565
- Jorge?
- I'll explain later...

1657
01:41:48,669 --> 01:41:51,297
- Good evening, General.
- Madam, I'm very sorry

1658
01:41:51,371 --> 01:41:53,271
to let you know that the wedding
has been dissolved.

1659
01:41:53,373 --> 01:41:56,672
And I'm also sorry to let
you know the reason.

1660
01:41:56,777 --> 01:41:58,267
I know the reason.

1661
01:41:58,378 --> 01:41:59,811
What can I do?

1662
01:41:59,880 --> 01:42:03,543
I'm ashemed. My deceased husband
suffered the same...

1663
01:42:03,650 --> 01:42:05,208
problem and Jorge inherited it.

1664
01:42:05,285 --> 01:42:07,480
- Then you knew!
- Of course.

1665
01:42:07,588 --> 01:42:09,055
And why didn't you warn me?

1666
01:42:09,123 --> 01:42:12,092
I didn't know you wanted a perfect
husband for your daughter!

1667
01:42:12,159 --> 01:42:16,721
No, but with such a disease,
it's a tragedy.

1668
01:42:16,797 --> 01:42:20,665
No, no, it's a common
thing to all men!

1669
01:42:20,767 --> 01:42:21,893
Madam! What do
you insinuate?

1670
01:42:22,002 --> 01:42:26,439
Come on, General, you may
have something to hide.

1671
01:42:26,540 --> 01:42:28,565
Madam, you're very wrong...

1672
01:42:28,642 --> 01:42:31,440
General, all that we speak
is not to be needed.

1673
01:42:31,512 --> 01:42:32,512
Good night.

1674
01:42:35,082 --> 01:42:37,812
Hey, now the family is complete.

1675
01:42:37,918 --> 01:42:39,545
How do you do madam?

1676
01:42:39,620 --> 01:42:41,850
- What are you doing here?
- I came to visit.

1677
01:42:41,922 --> 01:42:43,602
- Where is the rest?
- At the dinning room.

1678
01:42:43,657 --> 01:42:46,649
- And Jorge?
- Jorge is with Rosario.

1679
01:42:46,860 --> 01:42:47,884
Jorge with Rosario?

1680
01:42:47,995 --> 01:42:53,661
Strange indeed? But it's only because
the children Jorge has with Genoveva

1681
01:42:53,767 --> 01:42:55,735
won't be inherited.
What?

1682
01:42:55,836 --> 01:42:57,770
I'm telling you what
the General tod me.

1683
01:42:57,838 --> 01:43:00,136
Neither Pedro nor
Jorge told me..

1684
01:43:00,207 --> 01:43:03,938
Whe I ask, they only say "There are
things that can't be explained".

1685
01:43:04,044 --> 01:43:05,102
Is that ok?

1686
01:43:05,212 --> 01:43:07,942
I'll take out a truck without being
seen. I'll wait for you at the door.

1687
01:43:08,048 --> 01:43:10,676
- I'm taking out our stuff.
- We'll go through the front door..

1688
01:43:10,751 --> 01:43:13,083
Pick up my daughter
and God be with us!

1689
01:43:13,187 --> 01:43:14,347
- Is everything ready?
- Yeah.

1690
01:43:14,388 --> 01:43:16,322
- No, there's one missing thing.
- What?

1691
01:43:16,857 --> 01:43:17,857
This!

1692
01:43:18,892 --> 01:43:20,723
Yeah!

1693
01:43:23,397 --> 01:43:24,955
What the hell happens here?

1694
01:43:25,032 --> 01:43:26,897
A husband holding
the other woman.

1695
01:43:27,000 --> 01:43:30,527
And her brother kissing the
husband's wife in his face?

1696
01:43:30,637 --> 01:43:33,504
Mom, there are things that
can't be explained.

1697
01:43:33,607 --> 01:43:34,607
I told you so.

1698
01:43:34,708 --> 01:43:36,642
Now you will explain
or you'll know me.

1699
01:43:36,710 --> 01:43:37,710
One moment.

1700
01:43:39,146 --> 01:43:40,977
We're going to explain
everything.

1701
01:43:41,081 --> 01:43:43,948
No, you won't confuse me,
nor this one. Out of here!

1702
01:43:44,051 --> 01:43:45,985
- But mom.
- Out, I said!

1703
01:43:49,289 --> 01:43:53,817
- They told me that!
- They fooled you. I swear, yeah.

1704
01:43:53,961 --> 01:43:57,453
Jorge is a healthy guy, I know!

1705
01:43:57,564 --> 01:44:01,091
- Are you willing to testify it?
- Even with doctors, if you will.

1706
01:44:01,201 --> 01:44:03,135
- Alright! Come with me.
- Let's go.

1707
01:44:03,303 --> 01:44:05,362
Nobody is making a fool of me!

1708
01:44:05,439 --> 01:44:07,202
- Wait General.
- You're going to hear me!

1709
01:44:07,274 --> 01:44:10,539
- Let's talk like people.
- You shut up!

1710
01:44:10,777 --> 01:44:13,473
First I'll fight a duel
with you, then with you!

1711
01:44:13,580 --> 01:44:15,377
General, there's no need
for such killings!

1712
01:44:15,449 --> 01:44:17,974
It's late to explain.
On your way!

1713
01:44:18,619 --> 01:44:21,247
- But General, a little bit of..
- Shut up, or I'll fight a duel with you!

1714
01:44:21,321 --> 01:44:23,482
Yes general...

1715
01:44:23,557 --> 01:44:26,025
In spite of everything,
Jorge still loves me.

1716
01:44:26,226 --> 01:44:26,749
And Pedro loves me.

1717
01:44:26,827 --> 01:44:29,728
There's no doubt that
tragedy is after us!

1718
01:44:30,163 --> 01:44:33,599
That's why everybody's mad, this
poor arab in first place.

1719
01:44:33,967 --> 01:44:36,697
I'm no longer an
arab, I'm asian.

1720
01:44:37,004 --> 01:44:40,098
- Why?
- Because they took me for a ride!

1721
01:44:40,641 --> 01:44:41,801
Stop joking!

1722
01:44:42,109 --> 01:44:44,907
I'm not agree with these
crossed marriages.

1723
01:44:46,046 --> 01:44:47,570
Josefa, come here!

1724
01:44:49,383 --> 01:44:53,410
A terrible tragedy. The boys and the
general are going to shoot themselves!

1725
01:44:53,487 --> 01:44:56,718
- We must avoid that killing!
- God heavens!

1726
01:44:57,190 --> 01:44:59,215
- That's enough!
- Let me go!

1727
01:44:59,326 --> 01:45:01,453
I've got to punish
those bastards!

1728
01:45:01,561 --> 01:45:06,828
Let them finish the party singing,
and then you'll kill them!

1729
01:45:06,900 --> 01:45:10,996
No sir, I'll kill them firs, then they
can sing as much as they want!

1730
01:45:11,905 --> 01:45:15,602
Easy general, that I'll
explain everything!

1731
01:45:15,676 --> 01:45:20,010
- No darling, this can't be!
- Please daddy, you're so nice, say yes!

1732
01:45:20,480 --> 01:45:24,849
- Is our happiness, Mr. Elias.
- But look at the tangle of relatives!

1733
01:45:24,918 --> 01:45:27,148
I'm father-in-law and
uncle of Pedro.

1734
01:45:27,220 --> 01:45:29,188
As Jorge and Pedro
are like brothers,

1735
01:45:29,289 --> 01:45:31,348
Jorge is getting married
his sister-in-law.

1736
01:45:31,458 --> 01:45:33,688
And my poor grandaughter
will have two

1737
01:45:33,760 --> 01:45:36,058
step-fathers, and will
be of two uncles!

1738
01:45:36,163 --> 01:45:39,826
That mean that I'm not fater-in-law,
but fater of Jorge and Maria.

1739
01:45:39,900 --> 01:45:43,802
Maria marries a nephew,
then Mrs Josefa..

1740
01:45:43,904 --> 01:45:46,031
Is my woman and my sister
at the same time.

1741
01:45:46,139 --> 01:45:47,731
What a family salad!

1742
01:45:47,808 --> 01:45:52,973
Please stop, if not, I'm going to be
Pedro's mother, and I won't marry him.

1743
01:45:53,580 --> 01:45:57,778
Now tell me that Jorge, loving Rosario
as he does, wouldn't forgive?

1744
01:45:57,951 --> 01:46:00,442
Any woman can have
such a disgrace!

1745
01:46:00,954 --> 01:46:04,890
A country girl goes to the
city go to a ballroom

1746
01:46:04,958 --> 01:46:07,654
and there she's made high,
she can't be responsible!

1747
01:46:07,761 --> 01:46:08,819
What a villainy!

1748
01:46:08,929 --> 01:46:12,387
Why didn't you go after those
criminal, to be punished!

1749
01:46:12,499 --> 01:46:15,991
She's was thinking only in her
disgrace, snd how to suicide.

1750
01:46:16,236 --> 01:46:17,726
Pedro is very generous!

1751
01:46:17,838 --> 01:46:20,739
To marry Rosario just to
give a name to the child.

1752
01:46:20,841 --> 01:46:21,500
That was it!

1753
01:46:21,608 --> 01:46:24,328
Because they were legally married,
but they have lived like brothers!

1754
01:46:25,946 --> 01:46:27,914
Now I understand.

1755
01:46:28,482 --> 01:46:31,451
But Pedro, how he fooled me!

1756
01:46:31,551 --> 01:46:33,075
- What a bastard!
- Excuse me?

1757
01:46:33,153 --> 01:46:34,313
- Music!
- Music!

1758
01:46:34,388 --> 01:46:36,185
- Music!
- Music!

1759
01:46:46,500 --> 01:46:49,628
<i>Let's forget our pain!</i>

1760
01:46:49,703 --> 01:46:53,230

1779
01:48:09,783 --> 01:48:14,049
<i>A maricahi is playing there, and ..</i>

1780
01:48:14,154 --> 01:48:17,954
<i>A charro and a lady are dancing.</i>

1781
01:48:23,330 --> 01:48:27,767
<i>Our parties are so beautiful.</i>

1782

<i>Everything is hapiness,
