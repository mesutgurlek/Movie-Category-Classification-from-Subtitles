10
00:07:41,427 --> 00:07:44,919
Today's Music programme passed
off exceptionally well

11
00:07:45,631 --> 00:07:48,031
Now the important programme
after this interval is....

12
00:07:48,434 --> 00:07:49,128
...'Raga SankaraBharanam'

13
00:07:49,936 --> 00:07:52,336
Maestro of Rhythm,Sir
Sankara Shastri!

14
00:07:52,872 --> 00:07:54,499
...Who gave a new life
to the'Raga'

15
00:07:55,241 --> 00:07:58,074
...One who mesmerised the world all
over by his rendering of the tune!

16
00:07:58,878 --> 00:08:01,506
He'll sing that Raga
SankaraBharanam!

17
00:13:13,125 --> 00:13:17,494
...He stopped suddenly in the middle
of the Recital and walked out!

18
00:13:18,097 --> 00:13:19,029
That's all,isn't it,madam Sarada?

19
00:13:20,533 --> 00:13:23,866
When he starts singing,audience
sit like Sages in penance!

20
00:13:24,336 --> 00:13:26,327
Gopalam! do you know what
happened at Sarada's birth?

21
00:13:26,906 --> 00:13:28,032
Labour pains started
for madam....

22
00:13:28,440 --> 00:13:30,499
...When Doctor said that
situation is worsening!

23
00:13:30,943 --> 00:13:33,878
...l ran to the Music programme
to inform him!

24
00:13:34,113 --> 00:13:36,308
As soon as l saw him singing
with single minded devotion...

25
00:13:36,615 --> 00:13:37,809
...l stood there standstill!

26
00:13:38,751 --> 00:13:41,015
Atlast,after finishing the programme
when he came home....

27
00:13:41,420 --> 00:13:42,785
...Everything was over!

28
00:13:43,789 --> 00:13:45,518
He didn't even have a
last glimpse also!

29
00:13:48,260 --> 00:13:49,420
Seems to be like our carriage

30
00:13:50,429 --> 00:13:54,195
Did you hear? Oh God!,l find
anger even in that hoots also

31
00:17:58,343 --> 00:18:01,005
What's this Gopalam? ls there
any justice in it?

32
00:18:01,613 --> 00:18:02,602
...l am asking you
is it there?

33
00:18:03,182 --> 00:18:05,946
l am carrying my persucussion
why are you asking about justice?

34
00:18:06,151 --> 00:18:06,810
That's not the matter,Man!

35
00:18:07,119 --> 00:18:09,144
When this man met you for
the programme!

36
00:18:09,354 --> 00:18:11,117
lt seems you had asked
him to cancel it!

37
00:18:11,557 --> 00:18:13,286
...You sit here! l'll tell him
-No problem!

38
00:18:14,760 --> 00:18:19,060
Look! our Telugu people praising our
own Telugu man is quite different!

39
00:18:19,598 --> 00:18:21,361
People from a very far away
Karnataka state

40
00:18:21,567 --> 00:18:22,864
Coming here on behalf of
a Kannada Association

45
00:18:31,777 --> 00:18:33,608
They've arranged everything

46
00:18:34,079 --> 00:18:34,738
Yes sir!

47
00:18:35,347 --> 00:18:38,976
We have arranged everything
to Honour Mr.Sankara Shastry!

48
00:18:39,418 --> 00:18:42,148
On his name,we have even
sold tickets heavily!

49
00:18:42,554 --> 00:18:44,351
Now,lf you say no the

00:18:44,823 --> 00:18:46,154
...They'll finish off me
with it!

51
00:18:46,592 --> 00:18:48,822
Gentleman! that's what l'v
been speaking to him?

52
00:18:49,061 --> 00:18:51,120
You keep quiet!..keep quiet

53
00:18:51,563 --> 00:18:52,188
Did you hear this man?

54
00:18:52,664 --> 00:18:54,291
How sad he's feeling
in Kannada,poor chap?

55
00:18:54,800 --> 00:18:57,462
Whatever it may be,this
programme should go on!

56
00:18:57,803 --> 00:18:58,770
That's all sir!....that's all!

57
00:18:58,971 --> 00:19:00,700
lf Sankara Shastri's programme
is cancelled....

58
00:19:01,106 --> 00:19:01,765
...A lot of...

59
00:19:02,241 --> 00:19:06,007
...Didn't l tell you not
to interfere in my talk!

60
00:19:06,378 --> 00:19:07,003
Didn't l tell you?

61
00:19:07,212 --> 00:19:07,837
Yes sir,you've told!

62
00:19:08,046 --> 00:19:09,809
Leave it to me! you

63
00:19:10,149 --> 00:19:12,014
Sit down...please...

64
00:19:12,217 --> 00:19:16,176
What? ls your intention to deny
people hearing his music?

65
00:19:16,388 --> 00:19:16,854
What?!

66
00:19:18,290 --> 00:19:19,382
Sir,why are you asking me?

67
00:19:19,925 --> 00:19:22,018
You both are bosom pals,isn't it?

68
00:19:23,228 --> 00:19:24,627
Why don't you ask that
with my boss?

69
00:19:25,164 --> 00:19:25,960
l'll ask him only!

70
00:19:26,365 --> 00:19:28,026
...Not only ask him!l'll give
him a good shedding too!

71
00:19:28,534 --> 00:19:30,001
Even a killer who has
murdered 10 people...

72
00:19:30,636 --> 00:19:32,866
..l can look straight into his
eyes and make him accept the crime!

73
00:19:33,205 --> 00:19:35,070
What?....do you think am
l afraid of him?

74
00:19:35,507 --> 00:19:36,269
ls he there inside?

75
00:19:37,809 --> 00:19:38,867
He's there in the next
room only!

76
00:19:40,479 --> 00:19:42,106
You idiot! why don't you
tell that first?

77
00:19:43,048 --> 00:19:44,276
Do you think,would he have
heard my talk?

78
00:19:47,819 --> 00:19:48,649
What's it Madhava?

79
00:19:51,990 --> 00:19:53,821
What you were talking about beating
and shredding some one?

80
00:19:54,026 --> 00:19:55,050
Oh! lt's about your sister-in-law!

81
00:19:55,594 --> 00:19:57,459
As lf there are no vegetables
in the market....

82
00:19:57,963 --> 00:20:00,591
She took Rs 3 and brought
1 Kg of Brinjals....Brinjals!

83
00:20:00,966 --> 00:20:03,196
l was telling this to Gopalam
isn't it Gopalam?

84
00:20:03,569 --> 00:20:06,436
Sir,without talking about
musical programme!....

85
00:20:06,672 --> 00:20:08,139
...You're talking about
some brinjals

86
00:20:08,607 --> 00:20:10,700
You don't know about him!

87
00:20:11,176 --> 00:20:13,474
lf we talk about musical
programme!lt'll be disastrous

88
00:20:16,014 --> 00:20:17,174
...That crazy woman did
bring brinjals!

89
00:20:17,382 --> 00:20:18,644
Will she have to bring
only brinjals?

90
00:20:18,850 --> 00:20:19,646
ls it good?

91
00:20:20,519 --> 00:20:22,146
Poorthing! he's secretary of
Kannada Association!

92
00:20:25,224 --> 00:20:27,419
She did bring brinjals!
shouldn't they be good?

93
00:20:27,659 --> 00:20:28,455
...All were worm infected!

94
00:20:29,361 --> 00:20:30,953
..He wants to arrange your
music programme and....

95
00:20:32,864 --> 00:20:34,764
Even though worm infected l've
ordered her to make curry!

96
00:20:34,967 --> 00:20:37,834
Did she prepare it? she
made it very ordinarily!

97
00:20:38,170 --> 00:20:39,330
..He's...Honour with..Garter!

98
00:20:39,738 --> 00:20:40,568
My child! Sarada!

99
00:20:44,977 --> 00:20:45,636
...Keep this inside!

100
00:20:46,478 --> 00:20:49,504
Hey! will you listen to my
talk properly or not?

101
00:20:49,815 --> 00:20:50,782
What are you saying?

102
00:20:51,083 --> 00:20:52,744
Sometimes you're saying this and
then,for sometime that!

103
00:20:52,951 --> 00:20:53,508
..Talking about brinjals!...

104
00:20:53,852 --> 00:20:55,183
...What do exactly want
to tell me?

105
00:20:55,654 --> 00:20:56,313
Do you want me to tell?

106
00:20:56,521 --> 00:20:58,148
Sir,please tell him!...
tell him...tell him...

107
00:21:00,459 --> 00:21:02,017
He's secretary of Kannada
Association

108
00:21:02,628 --> 00:21:05,722
He wants to honour you by Elephent
procession with a Garter!

109
00:21:06,031 --> 00:21:07,430
lf you accept it,l'll be
very happy!

110
00:21:07,633 --> 00:21:08,497
lf you don't accept
then,it's a swear on me!

111
00:21:08,834 --> 00:21:09,266
..l am going!

112
00:21:24,483 --> 00:21:26,644
Oh! Lord Raghavendra! everything
is your mercy!

113
00:21:30,289 --> 00:21:32,086
Hey! Rathna! what is
Tulasi saying?

114
00:21:32,357 --> 00:21:33,483
What will she say,sir?

115
00:21:33,792 --> 00:21:35,657
Believe me! lf l say she's ready
to die for you!

116
00:21:35,994 --> 00:21:39,088
She's always immersed in your
thoughts only,poor mad girl!

117
00:21:39,631 --> 00:21:41,258
Sometime back it seems she had
seen you on the road!

118
00:21:41,833 --> 00:21:45,963
That night,she got up from sleep
half way & sleeping on my bed

119
00:21:46,204 --> 00:21:46,693
Do you know what
did she do?

120
00:21:47,739 --> 00:21:49,798
Yuck! how am l to say it?

121
00:21:50,442 --> 00:21:54,811
Even then,l told you her that l am
her mother,not the LandLord!

122
00:21:55,080 --> 00:21:55,808
But...still....

123
00:21:58,717 --> 00:22:01,379
...l am feeling very shy!
l can't tell it anymore

124
00:22:01,853 --> 00:22:03,912
Even at this age you're
making me sweat!

125
00:22:04,289 --> 00:22:07,190
l don't know how tantalising
you would've been in your youth!

126
00:22:09,528 --> 00:22:10,495
That days were quite different!

127
00:22:11,196 --> 00:22:12,925
When l was at Tulasi's age....

128
00:22:13,532 --> 00:22:16,933
No married man lived happily with
their wives in the village!

129
00:22:18,036 --> 00:22:18,764
That was a great time!

130
00:22:19,471 --> 00:22:21,200
...Even my daughter has got
all my traits!

131
00:22:21,873 --> 00:22:24,034
Sir,you're everything to her!

132
00:22:25,210 --> 00:22:27,303
What was that?..what was that?

133
00:22:27,979 --> 00:22:29,708
Ah! Diamond Necklace!

134
00:22:33,385 --> 00:22:36,752
How can l come bare neck
infront of the Land Lord!

135
00:22:37,055 --> 00:22:37,885
...How am l to come?

136
00:22:38,090 --> 00:22:39,352
...My child is feeling very
much like this!

137
00:22:40,892 --> 00:22:42,883
Sister,lf land Lord decides
what's Diamond necklace?

138
00:22:43,428 --> 00:22:44,895
..He can get even a Diamond
waist belt also!

139
00:22:45,163 --> 00:22:45,754
..lsn't it sir?

140
00:22:48,266 --> 00:22:49,790
Leave side those jewel's talk!

141
00:22:50,569 --> 00:22:52,400
This time l've come to this
place only for Tulasi

142
00:22:53,205 --> 00:22:54,866
lsn't it possible atleast
today or not....

143
00:22:55,107 --> 00:22:56,972
Oh! why isn't possible sir?

144
00:22:57,409 --> 00:23:00,173
Last time,it wasn't possible
because it was her menses period!

145
00:23:04,816 --> 00:23:06,977
Today,you come as soon as
night falls!

146
00:23:07,219 --> 00:23:08,447
We'll arrange everything
for you here only!

147
00:23:08,787 --> 00:23:09,981
You'll come definitely,isn't it?

148
00:23:14,693 --> 00:23:16,251
lf you don't come
it's a swear on me!

149
00:23:22,067 --> 00:23:23,796
Nice my child!...
lt's very nice...

150
00:23:24,202 --> 00:23:27,603
There,l've been trying hard
to attract that LandLord

151
00:23:28,140 --> 00:23:30,700
Here,you're sitting prettily to
repair strings of your instruments

152
00:23:31,276 --> 00:23:34,905
lf we believe,ldols of Gods
and ordinary mortals!...

153
00:23:35,247 --> 00:23:36,271
..We'll be left with only Ash!

154
00:23:36,715 --> 00:23:39,548
Fool,l've spent money to teach
you song & dance...

155
00:23:40,952 --> 00:23:42,146
...Only to mesmerise and keep these
rich men under your thumbs

156
00:23:43,355 --> 00:23:46,916
Actually,a priest mustn't have stammer
and we mustn't have devotion

157
00:23:47,259 --> 00:23:47,953
Understood my child?

158
00:23:49,594 --> 00:23:52,222
Look,that LandLord will come
her at dusk!

159
00:23:52,898 --> 00:23:55,799
lf you refuse,Goddess of wealth
will go away from our door step!

160
00:23:56,868 --> 00:23:58,927
l always wanted that eyes of such
rich men only must fall on you,so

161
00:23:59,337 --> 00:24:03,171
..l've been keeping you behind a curtain
even though so many desired you!

162
00:24:06,578 --> 00:24:10,912
Look,if you come after having
a nice head bath with oil

163
00:24:11,750 --> 00:24:13,479
..l'll plait your hairs with flowers
and make you wear a silk saree!

164
00:24:13,752 --> 00:24:15,743
What my child? you must
listen to me

165
00:24:16,054 --> 00:24:18,386
You're my Goddess,isn't it?
go,my child!

166
00:24:18,757 --> 00:24:20,019
Sister,why are you requesting her?

167
00:24:20,892 --> 00:24:23,452
Tonight,if she accepts that
Land Lord,it's okay!

168
00:24:24,095 --> 00:24:27,531
lf she acts madly,l'll tear her
apart into pieces and throw away

169
00:25:08,473 --> 00:25:09,371
Hey! she may be in this train?

170
00:25:09,774 --> 00:25:13,039
This train? ldiot,she has
already left in that train!

171
00:25:13,411 --> 00:25:14,139
Come with me,let me see!

172
00:26:27,652 --> 00:26:28,914
Gentelman! we've come!

173
00:26:29,821 --> 00:26:30,287
Get down!

174
00:26:32,490 --> 00:26:33,684
Fine?
-fine!

175
00:26:35,293 --> 00:26:35,725
Don't know!

176
00:26:36,294 --> 00:26:38,228
Shastri is in this coach
..this coach!?

177
00:34:21,926 --> 00:34:26,454
Oh! my child,there's no place where
l haven't searched for you!

178
00:34:26,898 --> 00:34:30,959
Without having food and sleep,l've
been searching you,my child!

179
00:34:31,602 --> 00:34:32,227
My child!

180
00:34:34,338 --> 00:34:34,861
What's this,sir?

181
00:34:35,306 --> 00:34:36,830
The girl who should've got
married and settled!

182
00:34:37,041 --> 00:34:37,871
Have you made her to
elope with you?

183
00:34:40,812 --> 00:34:42,939
Look madam,do you know whom
you are speaking with?

184
00:34:43,414 --> 00:34:44,210
l know it sir!

185
00:34:44,449 --> 00:34:46,007
l know very well about him!

186
00:34:46,384 --> 00:34:48,716
My daughter Tulasi is mad
about Music!

187
00:34:49,387 --> 00:34:50,547
Taking advantage of her weakness

188
00:34:50,755 --> 00:34:55,124
This music Teacher trapped her and
made her to elope with him!

189
00:34:58,629 --> 00:34:59,220
You come my child!

190
00:35:00,198 --> 00:35:00,892
Look gentlemen!

191
00:35:01,365 --> 00:35:05,802
For Holy places like this bring
some Holy man! they'll become purified

192
00:35:06,070 --> 00:35:09,233
But,not womanizers
like this man!

193
00:35:20,485 --> 00:35:21,645
l am getting late to the court!

194
00:35:22,086 --> 00:35:23,815
Please,quickly tell details
about your case!

195
00:35:24,622 --> 00:35:26,988
My father! he had..
two wives!

196
00:35:28,126 --> 00:35:29,320
l am first wife's son

197
00:35:29,794 --> 00:35:30,783
...My mother is no more!

198
00:35:30,895 --> 00:35:31,589
Extremely sorry!

199
00:35:32,063 --> 00:35:37,501
Now,my father wants to bequeth all
property to second wife's son

200
00:35:37,702 --> 00:35:38,498
Excuse me!
-yes madam!

201
00:35:38,703 --> 00:35:39,328
Will you come here for
a moment?

202
00:35:39,537 --> 00:35:39,935
Coming madam!

203
00:35:40,938 --> 00:35:42,200
Not you!....it's me!

204
00:35:44,642 --> 00:35:45,939
l am very busy there
what's it?

205
00:35:46,377 --> 00:35:47,674
ls it true?
-what?

206
00:35:47,879 --> 00:35:49,005
l couldn't believe it!

207
00:35:49,380 --> 00:35:52,213
lt seems that brother is roaming
all over with that Tulasi

208
00:35:53,351 --> 00:35:54,113
Till that,what you said
is true!

209
00:35:54,385 --> 00:35:56,216
Beyond that whatever you may hear
is totally false!-is it okay?!

210
00:35:56,454 --> 00:35:57,250
That isn't like that

211
00:35:57,855 --> 00:36:00,756
The whole village is gossipping
about it by biting ears!

212
00:36:00,892 --> 00:36:01,415
Let them bite their ears!

213
00:36:01,626 --> 00:36:04,356
Why only ears? let them bite and
eat their noses,eyes,hands,mouth!

214
00:36:04,562 --> 00:36:05,028
Not like....

215
00:36:05,229 --> 00:36:07,697
l am discussing with the party
there,don't disturb me!

216
00:36:11,802 --> 00:36:13,030
Ah!...what were you
saying man?

217
00:36:14,939 --> 00:36:15,906
...And your father had died!

218
00:36:16,140 --> 00:36:17,038
No

219
00:36:17,308 --> 00:36:19,833
My father has two wives
my mother has died!

220
00:36:21,078 --> 00:36:21,544
Excuse me!

221
00:36:26,751 --> 00:36:28,548
Oh God! what's your problem?

222
00:36:28,953 --> 00:36:31,786
lt's not a problem,why don't you
listen properly what l am saying?

223
00:36:31,989 --> 00:36:32,421
What's it?

224
00:36:32,623 --> 00:36:34,113
How orthodox is my brother?

225
00:36:34,458 --> 00:36:36,153
How traditional is his family?

226
00:36:36,627 --> 00:36:39,562
Without praying God,he wouldn't
even take a drop of water?

227
00:36:39,764 --> 00:36:41,527
Now,did he get over drunk and
fell on any streets?

228
00:36:42,033 --> 00:36:43,898
He gave shelter to an orphan
that's all,isn't it?

229
00:36:44,569 --> 00:36:46,799
Don't twist the point like
your parting of hair!

230
00:36:47,004 --> 00:36:47,436
That isn't it....

231
00:36:47,638 --> 00:36:49,663
Oh God!..outside a party...

232
00:36:55,179 --> 00:36:56,908
Oh! what were you saying?

233
00:36:57,181 --> 00:36:58,944
You have two wives and
your first wife's dead!

234
00:36:59,150 --> 00:37:01,209
No sir! l am dead....

235
00:37:01,519 --> 00:37:02,747
Greetings! l'll take leave
of you!

236
00:37:02,954 --> 00:37:04,319
Hey! man! wait.....no one's dead
come back!

237
00:37:04,555 --> 00:37:06,318
No sir....l don't want!

238
00:37:06,857 --> 00:37:10,953
Brother and his ancestors are
very orthodox,isn't it?

239
00:37:11,295 --> 00:37:11,954
Then,if he does....

240
00:37:13,164 --> 00:37:14,358
Gone...my party has gone away!

241
00:37:15,499 --> 00:37:16,295
What's your point?

242
00:37:17,134 --> 00:37:19,659
He gave shelter to Tulasi
that's all,isn't it?

243
00:37:20,504 --> 00:37:22,870
Both Love Music! so only he
did like that!

244
00:37:23,107 --> 00:37:23,505
ls it wrong?

245
00:37:23,975 --> 00:37:27,274
Tomorrow,if any lady customer comes
and talks with me here!

246
00:37:27,478 --> 00:37:29,639
Do you take it as that,l'll leave
you and go away with that lady?

247
00:37:31,482 --> 00:37:34,508
Whatever caste she may belong but
she's as Holy as the Oscimum sanctum

248
00:37:35,019 --> 00:37:38,614
No one gets that Modesty,Obedience
Humbleness and Devotion!

249
00:40:33,264 --> 00:40:37,291
Till now,you are tantalising me
like a hiding gauva behind the leaves!

250
00:40:37,968 --> 00:40:39,128
My desire on you is over!

251
00:40:40,171 --> 00:40:43,197
Now,you go with that music
teacher or go to the hell

252
00:40:44,975 --> 00:40:45,839
ls he God to you?

253
00:40:46,310 --> 00:40:50,406
Mad girl,what can this man be to
you who knows nothing except music?

254
00:40:50,848 --> 00:40:52,543
lf you want go with him
..go with him!

255
00:42:45,563 --> 00:42:45,961
That's all isn't it?

256
00:42:46,530 --> 00:42:47,292
Yes,Madhava!

257
00:42:48,065 --> 00:42:50,431
Somehow Tulasi must get out
of this case!

258
00:42:50,901 --> 00:42:52,095
l'll bear whatever it
may cost me

259
00:42:52,937 --> 00:42:53,801
Understood!

260
00:42:54,505 --> 00:42:59,465
lf there's any crime in this case
everything's of mother,not Tulasi!

261
00:42:59,743 --> 00:43:01,438
Somehow l'll argue and
win this case....

262
00:43:01,745 --> 00:43:02,177
Excuse me!

263
00:43:02,413 --> 00:43:02,777
What?

264
00:43:03,647 --> 00:43:05,114
Butter milk?!

265
00:43:06,150 --> 00:43:06,878
Which one is with lesser salt?!

266
00:43:07,084 --> 00:43:07,550
This one!

267
00:43:08,586 --> 00:43:12,215
Now,my point is that l know the
relationship between you both

268
00:43:12,590 --> 00:43:14,524
But,there's a world at large

269
00:43:14,992 --> 00:43:17,927
Even if a father goes out
with his grown up daughter!

270
00:43:18,596 --> 00:43:20,530
This world talks something
bad about them!

271
00:43:20,898 --> 00:43:23,958
Madhava,l am not afraid of
this world,except God!

272
00:43:24,835 --> 00:43:29,795
The relationship l've with Tulasi
only l & God know about it!

273
00:43:30,441 --> 00:43:31,772
You think about the case!?

274
00:43:43,787 --> 00:43:44,845
You mean to say,you've
accepted this case?

275
00:43:46,423 --> 00:43:47,981
l mean you're going to
argue Tulasi's case!

276
00:43:48,192 --> 00:43:50,092
lsn't it to argue? that l've
taken up this case!

277
00:43:50,394 --> 00:43:51,861
Will you argue and win it also?

278
00:43:52,162 --> 00:43:53,561
lsn't it to win that l
am going to argue?

279
00:43:54,331 --> 00:43:55,593
Then,break that mirror first!

280
00:43:56,033 --> 00:43:56,499
Why?

281
00:43:56,700 --> 00:43:57,632
l want a broken glass piece!

282
00:43:57,835 --> 00:43:59,029
Why? do you want to
stab and kill me?

283
00:43:59,236 --> 00:44:00,703
No,l'll stab and kill myself

284
00:44:01,438 --> 00:44:03,497
You've tottooed conch & discus
on your shoulders!

285
00:44:03,841 --> 00:44:05,706
Are you going to argue for
a prostitute?

286
00:44:06,043 --> 00:44:07,476
Oh! my God!

287
00:44:07,778 --> 00:44:10,372
Whatever you may say,l'll argue
her case that's for definite!

288
00:44:10,581 --> 00:44:12,242
What?...what's the problem
in it?

289
00:44:28,899 --> 00:44:30,423
You're born wrongly to me!

290
00:44:30,901 --> 00:44:33,028
The good advices given me have
become loathsome,isn't it?

291
00:44:33,370 --> 00:44:34,803
Will you bring your own
mother to the streets?

292
00:44:35,572 --> 00:44:37,233
You'll pay for all this!

293
00:44:39,376 --> 00:44:40,365
Sister,you don't feel sad!

294
00:44:40,811 --> 00:44:42,711
Before you come back,l'll
put her into the right track!

295
00:44:43,414 --> 00:44:47,373
l begot a very bad progeny
so only l am going through this

296
00:44:55,259 --> 00:44:56,226
Where are you going off?

297
00:44:56,660 --> 00:44:58,355
l'll deskin you & dry you up
be careful!

298
00:44:58,595 --> 00:44:59,186
Come to the house!

299
00:45:00,764 --> 00:45:02,664
lf we request humbly
you'll not listen!

300
00:45:03,333 --> 00:45:04,493
lf l lash all over your body!

301
00:45:04,702 --> 00:45:06,363
You'll go to any man quietly
as and when l order you!

302
00:45:06,570 --> 00:45:07,229
Come to the house!

303
00:46:59,483 --> 00:47:02,281
Child Sarada,l am going
away from here!

304
00:47:11,261 --> 00:47:15,095
lf we allow anyone into the house
all the sins will besiege you!

305
00:47:15,465 --> 00:47:16,932
They'll go to the hell!

306
00:47:17,234 --> 00:47:20,567
This was a orthodox house so only
l could stay for so many days

307
00:47:20,904 --> 00:47:24,203
Now,with new ideas and if they
allow new people into the house

308
00:47:24,508 --> 00:47:26,874
...l feel like l am in the
middle of a great fire!

309
00:47:28,378 --> 00:47:31,870
Hereafter l can't stay here! l'll
retire in some temple

310
00:47:32,749 --> 00:47:33,716
Are you listening my child?

311
00:47:37,988 --> 00:47:39,580
Till now,lf they had mentioned
the name of this house!

312
00:47:39,990 --> 00:47:42,390
..They used to think it as
pure as the fire!

313
00:47:42,793 --> 00:47:45,057
Now the same people are
abusing this house

314
00:47:45,429 --> 00:47:47,056
Hereafter l can't stay here
my child Sarada!

315
00:47:48,265 --> 00:47:49,960
Father,that cooking aunty!...

316
00:47:50,200 --> 00:47:51,565
My child,go and get my
prayer room ready!

317
00:48:54,498 --> 00:48:55,123
Oh Mother!

318
00:49:03,073 --> 00:49:04,506
Father,the vessel fell!

319
00:49:05,309 --> 00:49:08,369
While,l was coming quickly to
prepare food for the God's offering....

320
00:49:13,917 --> 00:49:16,249
What? don't you know to cook?

321
00:49:22,459 --> 00:49:25,553
When a small girl was trying
to cook with great difficulty

322
00:49:26,096 --> 00:49:27,723
Those who know it can go and
help her,isn't it?

323
00:49:35,472 --> 00:49:39,340
Rituals & traditions are for keeping
a man's heart in right path only

324
00:49:40,243 --> 00:49:43,041
They're not to create barriers
between men by caste,Tulasi!

325
00:59:01,204 --> 00:59:01,670
Next you came in!

326
00:59:08,778 --> 00:59:09,642
Madam,do you need the cart?

327
00:59:21,791 --> 00:59:26,057
Sir,A bad man's sin is taking
a human form in me

328
00:59:26,796 --> 00:59:28,388
l may have expected much more
than my luck!

329
00:59:29,165 --> 00:59:33,761
My wish of serving you remained
an unfulfilled wish!

330
00:59:34,470 --> 00:59:37,962
So,l'll name my forthcoming
child on your name

331
00:59:38,675 --> 00:59:40,074
Have you got any objections sir?

332
00:59:40,944 --> 00:59:43,742
You've only told that Sankarabharanam
means poisonous snake!

333
00:59:44,280 --> 00:59:46,612
The poisonous snake became
a jewel to Lord Shiva!

334
00:59:47,417 --> 00:59:49,578
The poisonous seed growing
inside me!

335
00:59:50,153 --> 00:59:54,954
lf it can reach your lotus feet
that's more than enough for me!

336
00:59:55,825 --> 00:59:56,291
Madam,get in!

337
01:01:45,568 --> 01:01:47,092
Mother,why are you praying
to the foot prints?

338
01:01:47,937 --> 01:01:51,737
Didn't l tell you that,there's one
who's Mother,Father,Teacher & God to us!

339
01:01:51,941 --> 01:01:53,408
These are his foot prints! son!

340
01:01:54,277 --> 01:01:55,574
Oh! ls it of Mr.Sankara Shastri's!

341
01:01:56,946 --> 01:01:57,412
Where's he?

342
01:03:20,263 --> 01:03:21,252
Son,what are you going to
tell him?

343
01:03:21,864 --> 01:03:24,458
Sir,my parents are dead!

344
01:03:25,334 --> 01:03:26,824
Sir,l am an orphan!

345
01:03:28,738 --> 01:03:32,504
lf you feed me l'll serve you
& be at your feet only!

346
01:03:36,412 --> 01:03:38,505
For so many years l had looked
after you so well!

347
01:03:39,448 --> 01:03:41,279
Only to present you
at his feet!

348
01:03:42,785 --> 01:03:44,514
The luck which didn't favour me
if it favours you!

349
01:03:45,288 --> 01:03:47,222
Only to see it happily and die!

350
01:03:48,090 --> 01:03:50,888
Don't worry mother,some how l'll
enter his house!

351
01:03:51,194 --> 01:03:54,129
...l'll learn music from him and
become as great as himself

352
01:07:51,934 --> 01:07:52,764
Greetings madam!

353
01:07:55,304 --> 01:07:57,602
You're a small kid why are
you singing that song?

354
01:07:57,940 --> 01:08:00,465
You're singing of wide oceans do
you know the meaning of it?

355
01:08:00,643 --> 01:08:01,701
....Means....

356
01:08:06,982 --> 01:08:07,846
Oceans means....

357
01:08:08,217 --> 01:08:11,744
When elders in the family've great
difficulties like marriage,ills..etc!

358
01:08:13,689 --> 01:08:15,680
When they're not able to
withstand these difficulties....

359
01:08:16,092 --> 01:08:18,686
They'll say that we are not able to
swim through this family of ocean!

360
01:08:18,928 --> 01:08:19,656
That's the meaning of it!

361
01:08:20,162 --> 01:08:21,186
Oh! ls it the meaning?

362
01:08:21,464 --> 01:08:23,261
Oceans means difficulties!

363
01:08:23,599 --> 01:08:27,228
Look! without knowing the meaning of it
l was singing about myself only

364
01:08:27,403 --> 01:08:29,268
l too have many difficulties

365
01:08:29,738 --> 01:08:32,502
l don't have parents
l am an orphan!

366
01:08:32,708 --> 01:08:34,073
Even that is also an ocean of
difficulty,isn't it?

367
01:08:35,177 --> 01:08:36,735
lf you had a small kid
brother like me!

368
01:08:36,979 --> 01:08:39,470
How nicely you would've dressed
him up and sent him to school

369
01:08:39,682 --> 01:08:42,276
l don't have anyone to send me
to school or good clothes!

370
01:08:42,518 --> 01:08:43,883
Even that is also an ocean of
difficulty,isn't it?

371
01:08:44,153 --> 01:08:48,453
Sometimes,even lf l roam few streets
l don't get even a fistful of rice!

372
01:08:48,858 --> 01:08:51,759
Then,feeling very hungry,l'll drink
water to my stomach

373
01:08:52,027 --> 01:08:52,493
That's all!

374
01:08:52,828 --> 01:08:57,731
For every gulp,l'll imagine it
as some food item and drink it

375
01:09:00,035 --> 01:09:05,029
When it rains or gets very cold
l'll sleep in a corner in some temple!

376
01:09:05,441 --> 01:09:07,671
Like this l've got lot
of oceans of difficulties!

377
01:09:07,943 --> 01:09:11,140
Sometimes,l'll sing this song
sitting in some temple

378
01:09:11,347 --> 01:09:12,507
Then,why did you come
here today?

379
01:09:12,781 --> 01:09:15,750
Only yesterday,l came to know that
this is Sankara Shastri's house!

380
01:09:16,585 --> 01:09:17,347
You're his daughter,isn't it?

381
01:09:18,487 --> 01:09:19,419
...l am new to this place!

382
01:09:19,688 --> 01:09:21,679
Just because you're his daughter
you may not know about it!

383
01:09:22,091 --> 01:09:26,425
Right from useless singers like
me to Great Musicians!

384
01:09:26,829 --> 01:09:29,195
Sankara Shastri is God
to everyone of them!

385
01:09:29,665 --> 01:09:30,689
We don't have any other God!

386
01:09:31,133 --> 01:09:33,567
So only l am sitting at his door
step and singing like this

387
01:09:33,769 --> 01:09:35,361
That God's heart may melt....

388
01:09:35,571 --> 01:09:38,540
And shower mercy on me and
give me a job & shelter!

389
01:09:38,741 --> 01:09:40,675
Expecting this l've been
singing at his door step!

390
01:09:41,777 --> 01:09:44,678
Poor Boy! are you feeling hungry?

391
01:09:45,247 --> 01:09:45,713
Yes!

392
01:09:46,215 --> 01:09:47,876
l didn't eat anything
since yesterday!

393
01:09:48,617 --> 01:09:49,083
ls it so?!

394
01:09:50,386 --> 01:09:50,875
Come,brother!

395
01:09:51,754 --> 01:09:54,052
Thank God! l've got the
priest's Boon

396
01:09:54,290 --> 01:09:55,723
..Now,lt's enough it l get
the God's boon

397
01:09:56,559 --> 01:09:58,390
Can l call you as sister?

398
01:09:58,661 --> 01:09:59,992
You can,what's wrong in it?

399
01:10:00,196 --> 01:10:02,187
Then,sister you don't have to worry
about anything from now!

400
01:10:02,531 --> 01:10:03,657
...Now that your brother
has come to you!

401
01:10:03,933 --> 01:10:04,365
l may look very small
but l can do all the work

402
01:10:08,504 --> 01:10:10,267
Without cutting my fingers
l can cut vegetables!

403
01:10:10,539 --> 01:10:12,006
Without tearing l can
wash clothes!

404
01:10:12,341 --> 01:10:14,673
Then,without spoiling the broom
l can sweep home clean!

405
01:10:15,110 --> 01:10:17,078
Oh God! do you know how many
jobs l can do?

406
01:10:17,279 --> 01:10:17,973
Come and show me!

407
01:10:21,550 --> 01:10:23,347
Will you do the cooking
traditionaly or....

408
01:10:23,552 --> 01:10:25,884
Even that also you want
me to do!

409
01:10:26,155 --> 01:10:28,885
You don't have to do anything
you just sit here!

410
01:10:29,358 --> 01:10:30,757
l'll call you as soon as
l finish my cooking!

411
01:10:55,484 --> 01:10:59,113
Son,lf you touch their door you'll
hear the music of Tanbura

412
01:11:16,305 --> 01:11:20,435
Wherever you place you feet in that
house,you'll hear the basic 7 notes

413
01:11:46,502 --> 01:11:48,663
That house itself is a Temple
for Goddess of Learning!

414
01:12:21,870 --> 01:12:22,859
Greetings sir!

415
01:12:27,943 --> 01:12:28,204
Sarada,why did you allow this
boy into the house?

416
01:12:28,344 --> 01:12:29,538
Father it seems he's
an orphan!

417
01:12:31,447 --> 01:12:34,041
Sir,l am not boy
l am Sankaram

418
01:12:34,650 --> 01:12:35,207
l am an.....
sister,you tell him!

419
01:12:35,484 --> 01:12:36,883
..l can't say anything further
regarding this matter!

420
01:12:39,922 --> 01:12:42,220
lf we feed him,he said he'll stay
with us only doing odd jobs for us!

421
01:12:42,591 --> 01:12:44,718
So feeling pity on him l only
allowed him to stay here!

422
01:12:46,862 --> 01:12:49,228
Sir,even yesterday,l had come
to ask you about this only!

423
01:12:49,631 --> 01:12:50,757
As soon as you opened the door

424
01:12:51,200 --> 01:12:54,226
Aren't there those poltergiests!
hearing their cries & shrieks

425
01:12:54,703 --> 01:12:57,228
Making fun of them,l shook
my hips like this...

426
01:12:57,473 --> 01:12:59,805
You opened the door and
slapped me!

427
01:13:00,109 --> 01:13:04,102
Sir,even if you scold or beat me
l've come to be at your feet only!

428
01:13:09,585 --> 01:13:10,813
My stomach is very small
isn't it,sir?

429
01:13:11,453 --> 01:13:13,853
l'll not eat much...
only this much!

430
01:13:14,223 --> 01:13:15,747
l'll do everything for you sir!

431
01:13:16,125 --> 01:13:17,251
l'll wash your clothes!

432
01:13:17,559 --> 01:13:19,527
Your..and sir,l know the prayer
Hymn also!

433
01:13:19,962 --> 01:13:22,192
While you're doing the prayer
l'll recite it!

434
01:13:22,831 --> 01:13:26,699
Sir,when you take bath,you'll not be
able to reach you back,isn't it?

435
01:13:27,035 --> 01:13:28,161
...l'll clean it for you!

436
01:14:29,331 --> 01:14:30,628
Have you written it? yes sir
l've written it!

437
01:14:30,766 --> 01:14:35,567
Now,the intro will come
here again

438
01:14:36,038 --> 01:14:36,402
That's it!

439
01:14:37,372 --> 01:14:41,809
You have many records and other
things in your home,isn't it?

440
01:14:42,010 --> 01:14:42,499
Yes!

441
01:14:43,145 --> 01:14:44,134
Did you hear this song
at any time?

442
01:14:44,279 --> 01:14:44,904
l've heard it,Master!

443
01:14:45,280 --> 01:14:46,144
Sing it as you've heard it!

444
01:14:56,024 --> 01:14:57,685
Stop it...stop it!

445
01:14:58,460 --> 01:14:59,791
That's the difference between
you and me!

446
01:15:00,762 --> 01:15:04,198
Long back this song was tuned in
this Raga while travelling in a boat!

447
01:15:05,133 --> 01:15:11,834
Now,Buses,Trains,Planes,Rockets
Jackets,Jets everything have come,isn't it?

448
01:15:12,407 --> 01:15:14,102
Speed!...the whole world is
nothing but speed!

449
01:15:14,676 --> 01:15:17,110
How speed has come into our
daily life?

450
01:15:17,646 --> 01:15:19,477
Just like that,it must come
into our Music also!

451
01:15:21,383 --> 01:15:24,375
Regarding this,l've done so
many new experiments!...

452
01:15:25,354 --> 01:15:26,446
...l've found new Ragas
and tuned them!

453
01:15:28,690 --> 01:15:32,490
lf l say truthfully,learning music
from a Maestro like me...

454
01:15:33,729 --> 01:15:34,525
..lt is your luck!

455
01:15:38,267 --> 01:15:40,201
Do you know how to sing
this song really?

456
01:15:40,802 --> 01:15:41,564
How to sing it sir?

457
01:16:25,414 --> 01:16:26,608
Oh! is it you Mr.Sankara Bharanam?!

458
01:16:27,082 --> 01:16:27,571
...Come...come..come

459
01:16:28,116 --> 01:16:30,482
lt's very important that orthodox
people like you

460
01:16:30,886 --> 01:16:34,879
..Should compulsarily hear the
experiments by Maestro's like me!

461
01:16:35,490 --> 01:16:37,515
Breaking up the word into
letters as you wish...

462
01:16:38,093 --> 01:16:40,493
And changing the meaning,is that
what you call as experiment?

463
01:16:41,296 --> 01:16:45,699
Das! A hungry child calls its
mother in a different way

464
01:16:46,568 --> 01:16:50,299
A child got hurt calls it mother
in a different way

465
01:16:51,006 --> 01:16:56,239
A child getting up in the middle of
sleep calls its mother in an another way

466
01:16:56,979 --> 01:17:02,940
Every experience has a definite
Note,Rhythm & Tune!

467
01:17:03,986 --> 01:17:08,616
Das,behind every word of that Hymn
there's heart felt experience!

468
01:17:09,524 --> 01:17:17,124
This song came out of the heart of
a Great Saint in a Trance!

469
01:17:17,532 --> 01:17:18,260
..And this Raga!

470
01:17:18,533 --> 01:17:20,763
With insufficient knowledge and
in the name of experimenting...

471
01:17:21,203 --> 01:17:24,138
Don't desecrete the
Nectar of Music!

472
01:17:24,806 --> 01:17:28,264
The music,on which this Nation
holds it's head high!

473
01:17:29,044 --> 01:17:29,976
..Don't vulgarise it!

474
01:17:31,980 --> 01:17:32,844
Don't know,what's all this fuss?

475
01:17:33,715 --> 01:17:37,082
l don't understand,not only his
song's even his talk also!

476
01:17:37,886 --> 01:17:40,116
Andalu! Did you understand
anything?

477
01:17:40,288 --> 01:17:41,380
Master,l understood it
very well!

478
01:17:41,723 --> 01:17:44,385
Wipe it off! wipe off the
cob webs from your brain!

479
01:17:45,427 --> 01:17:46,519
..Now,learn the song child!

480
01:17:46,728 --> 01:17:48,923
You don't know anything
l'll not learn from you!

481
01:18:00,008 --> 01:18:04,468
Sir,l understood everything you
said to that master!

482
01:18:05,247 --> 01:18:10,549
But,sir l couldn't understand
the meaning of 'Experience' only!

483
01:18:11,353 --> 01:18:13,287
Sir,what do you mean
by'Experence'?

484
01:18:14,089 --> 01:18:15,886
An idea,that a Language
can't fathom

485
01:18:16,758 --> 01:18:18,817
An idea that'll melt
your heart!

486
01:18:19,394 --> 01:18:23,023
Oh! is it? then,isn't there that
'Experience'in that master's song?

487
01:18:23,832 --> 01:18:24,628
There's no 'Experence'in it!

488
01:18:25,500 --> 01:18:27,730
There's Derision in it!
there's Ridicule it!

489
01:18:28,870 --> 01:18:32,704
When we sing that Raga even
stones should melt!

490
01:18:34,476 --> 01:18:35,909
Music in a Boon!

491
01:18:36,778 --> 01:18:42,683
A God given power! Ridiculing
it is a great sin!

492
01:18:43,218 --> 01:18:47,279
Then,shouldn't we sing
like this,isn't it?

493
01:18:47,489 --> 01:18:47,955
You shouldn't!

494
01:18:48,623 --> 01:18:50,989
That isn't the style to sing
that devotional song!

495
01:23:20,528 --> 01:23:21,017
Uncle! come!

496
01:23:21,696 --> 01:23:22,720
lsn't you father at home?

497
01:23:23,231 --> 01:23:25,699
He has gone out uncle,he'll come
back please be seated!

498
01:23:25,900 --> 01:23:28,664
There's no time to sit! do one thing
pack your clothes quickly!

499
01:23:29,070 --> 01:23:29,627
Why uncle?

500
01:23:30,071 --> 01:23:31,663
l and your Aunty are going
to Annavaram!

501
01:23:32,073 --> 01:23:33,040
She's has to fulfill a wish!

502
01:23:33,541 --> 01:23:37,238
lf you also come will us and
have a glimpse of the Lord!

503
01:23:37,579 --> 01:23:40,776
l feel that your marriage time
will arrive at the earliest!

504
01:23:41,149 --> 01:23:42,207
Come on,get ready!
get ready

505
01:23:42,417 --> 01:23:43,281
After asking father's permission!...

506
01:23:43,752 --> 01:23:44,776
Father! what father?!

507
01:23:45,387 --> 01:23:48,754
He never takes you out
no entertainment or fun!

508
01:23:48,957 --> 01:23:51,357
What a father he is?
completely abstruce father!

509
01:23:52,660 --> 01:23:56,528
Uncle,that isn't it!l think it'll be
better if you inform him & take me

510
01:23:56,798 --> 01:23:59,096
Why? Am l afraid of
your father?

511
01:23:59,401 --> 01:24:00,333
Why? will be chop of my head?

512
01:24:00,869 --> 01:24:02,496
You were very young,you may
not remember it!

513
01:24:03,071 --> 01:24:05,164
..Your father used to shiver
even at my thought!

514
01:24:05,607 --> 01:24:07,905
He never used to talk to me
looking straight into my eyes!

515
01:24:08,810 --> 01:24:11,278
He used to go away after talking
looking at threshold,doors,etc..

516
01:24:11,479 --> 01:24:14,073
Fearing that you'll be afraid if
he sees your straight

517
01:24:14,215 --> 01:24:16,740
Shut up,you impertinent boy
l'll tear you apart!

518
01:24:16,951 --> 01:24:17,383
Sir!

519
01:24:21,756 --> 01:24:23,018
l'll turn and pluck out your ears!
Be careful!

520
01:24:23,224 --> 01:24:23,918
...Look,sir has come!

521
01:24:24,292 --> 01:24:27,591
Let him come,today,l'll
wash him clean!

522
01:24:28,229 --> 01:24:31,357
lf l ask him to send Sarada
with us to the pilgrim centre

523
01:24:31,633 --> 01:24:32,930
ls he so brave enough
to refuse me?

524
01:24:33,168 --> 01:24:33,759
Which place?

525
01:24:36,971 --> 01:24:38,871
l and your sister-in-law are
going to Annavaram!

526
01:24:39,340 --> 01:24:41,001
lf you don't send Sarada with
us it's a swear on me!

527
01:24:41,509 --> 01:24:42,305
Sarada pack your bags!

528
01:24:48,516 --> 01:24:51,542
l can't anymore!God l can't
go up this steps!

529
01:24:52,554 --> 01:24:56,456
Hey! Kamudu! l am feeling
breathlessness!

530
01:24:56,891 --> 01:24:59,724
Good! as if the mortar for pounding
grains,complaining to the drum!

531
01:25:00,161 --> 01:25:01,719
..You're complaining to me
about breathlessness!

532
01:25:02,063 --> 01:25:03,121
..Already l am feeling
giddiness

533
01:25:03,832 --> 01:25:05,527
Telling that going to temple
fasting would do good!

534
01:25:05,834 --> 01:25:07,995
You brought me here without
allowing me to have coffee also!

535
01:25:08,503 --> 01:25:09,401
Come on!..move on!

536
01:25:10,338 --> 01:25:13,307
Lord Sathyanarayana!
Hey! You?!

537
01:25:14,275 --> 01:25:17,767
Me? l thought you were
calling the Lord!

538
01:25:17,979 --> 01:25:18,377
Oh! God! it's a sin!

539
01:25:20,515 --> 01:25:20,981
What?

540
01:25:21,416 --> 01:25:24,317
Open that water jug and give me
some water,l'll quench my thirst!

541
01:25:54,983 --> 01:25:57,577
Oh! God! My Golden Glass!

542
01:26:24,078 --> 01:26:24,567
Thanks madam!

543
01:26:31,853 --> 01:26:33,150
Okay! come let's go!

544
01:26:33,721 --> 01:26:36,053
Grandma,we'll sit here for
some time! it's very fine here!

545
01:26:36,491 --> 01:26:38,356
Up there,it'll be better
than this!come!

546
01:26:51,539 --> 01:26:55,703
Hey! l am feeling again
very tired

547
01:26:56,211 --> 01:26:59,510
Feeling it? thank God! please sit here
for sometime and quench your throat

548
01:27:00,915 --> 01:27:04,214
Grandma,for every second step
take rest & have some water

549
01:27:04,619 --> 01:27:05,745
That is my wish!

550
01:27:06,621 --> 01:27:07,087
Here!

551
01:27:49,397 --> 01:27:51,126
Why are you so irresponsible?

552
01:27:51,933 --> 01:27:55,130
That was given by my parents as
a dowry,when l got married!

553
01:27:55,570 --> 01:27:58,801
l was looking after that glass
like my own life!

554
01:27:59,574 --> 01:28:01,201
l don't know,how many dents
it may have got?

555
01:28:21,629 --> 01:28:23,893
Hey! hey! wait
-what happened sir?

556
01:28:24,098 --> 01:28:25,156
What's there in the bag,show me?

557
01:28:25,366 --> 01:28:30,497
Hey! take it out..take it out

First take it out

559
01:28:33,941 --> 01:28:35,499
So,small boy,yet....

560
01:28:37,879 --> 01:28:38,345
Grandma!

561
01:28:49,357 --> 01:28:50,346
Have you seen my grandma?

562
01:28:50,925 --> 01:28:52,358
How do l know,who's
your grandmother?

563
01:28:53,628 --> 01:28:55,289
Already she's little crazy,l don't
know where she might have gone?

564
01:28:58,232 --> 01:28:58,857
Grandma!

565
01:28:59,300 --> 01:29:01,530
Stand properly in the queue

566
01:29:02,236 --> 01:29:03,396
Grandma! Grandma

567
01:29:04,339 --> 01:29:05,636
Please,wait my grandma
is missing!

568
01:29:06,274 --> 01:29:06,740
Grandma!

569
01:29:11,079 --> 01:29:11,875
Hey! Kamudu!

570
01:29:12,280 --> 01:29:13,304
Why did you come without
informing me?

571
01:29:13,548 --> 01:29:15,311
Do you know,l was searching
you all over futily!

572
01:29:15,616 --> 01:29:18,585
Enough of your cleverness! before
that security sees you,join the queue!

573
01:29:18,786 --> 01:29:21,550
lf he sees you he'll throw
you out of the line!

574
01:29:21,823 --> 01:29:22,619
May be this is ladies queue!

575
01:29:22,824 --> 01:29:23,722
No problem! come in!

576
01:29:24,926 --> 01:29:25,483
Did you bring the glass?

577
01:29:25,693 --> 01:29:26,022
Brought it!

578
01:29:43,778 --> 01:29:46,611
Yes move on...move on!

579
01:29:47,048 --> 01:29:49,414
Move on...move on

Come on sir,quickly!..
move on...

581
01:29:54,889 --> 01:29:55,548
Move on..move on!

582
01:29:56,290 --> 01:29:56,779
Sir,you please wait!

583
01:29:58,059 --> 01:29:59,185
Why are you stopping us?

584
01:29:59,394 --> 01:30:00,918
There's no space inside
go after some time!

585
01:30:01,729 --> 01:30:03,390
Look,allow us to go!

586

lf you want,stop the
people behind us!

587
01:30:06,300 --> 01:30:07,426
That is not possible madam
eveyone is equal here!

588
01:30:07,869 --> 01:30:11,327
Buying a bus ticket for Rs 2 and
coming from a far away place!

589
01:30:11,606 --> 01:30:14,006
When we have come for a glimpse of
God!who are you to stop us?

590
01:30:14,642 --> 01:30:17,543
Look! do you think am l an
ordinary woman?

591
01:30:18,312 --> 01:30:19,711
ln Kakinada isn't there a son
of Gundu family

592
01:30:20,314 --> 01:30:22,282
Do you know,whos'it? he's Head Constable

593
01:30:22,717 --> 01:30:24,412
Don't you know him?

594
01:30:24,685 --> 01:30:25,617
...He's my nephew!

01:30:25,987 --> 01:30:27,284
Hey! you come in...

Okay,you both sit here,l'll

602
01:30:40,501 --> 01:30:40,796
Alright!

Uncle,why do you take trouble

Will you get it? my child

..We'll be sitting here
and get it!

607
01:30:56,851 --> 01:31:01,254
May be we are getting late
for the bus down the hill!

608
01:31:02,423 --> 01:31:05,392
Go quickly and get one packet
of God's offerings!

609
01:31:06,461 --> 01:31:07,155
l can't go!

610
01:31:08,029 --> 01:31:11,487
You must go and get it & then if
you feed me with your hands!

611
01:31:12,200 --> 01:31:13,667
..Till then,l am not in a position

Alright,l'll go myself!

613
01:31:18,473 --> 01:31:20,031
Wait! you're old! why do you
take trouble?

614
01:31:20,274 --> 01:31:21,332
Give it to me,l'll go
and get it!

615
01:31:51,072 --> 01:31:51,970
One packet

Seems to have given
excess change?!

618
01:32:34,415 --> 01:32:35,746
Uncle,give it to me,l'll
find out and come!

619
01:32:35,950 --> 01:32:37,645
lts God's property! give and
then only come,my child!

620
01:32:38,953 --> 01:32:39,351
Take it!

621
01:32:42,089 --> 01:32:42,748
What's this?

622
01:32:42,957 --> 01:32:43,423
What?

623
01:32:43,858 --> 01:32:46,258
You took Rs 10 but brought
only one packet!

624
01:32:46,460 --> 01:32:48,792
..The balance should be Rs 9.50
but you've brought only Rs 3.00!!

625
01:32:50,965 --> 01:32:51,431
Wait here!

626
01:33:04,211 --> 01:33:05,644
You've given less change,you've
given more change to me!

627
01:33:06,213 --> 01:33:08,374
Settle it between yourselves
why to distub me?

628
01:33:27,301 --> 01:33:30,293
Grandma,take it your Rs 9.50
tie it safely in your saree corner!

629
01:33:30,538 --> 01:33:31,402
Give me some water Please!

630
01:33:31,839 --> 01:33:32,362
Where's the water jug?

631
01:33:33,608 --> 01:33:35,007
You were only carrying
it in your hands!

632
01:33:35,509 --> 01:33:35,975
Yes!

633
01:33:36,143 --> 01:33:39,476
You've missed it some where?
was it any ordinary water jug?

634
01:33:39,680 --> 01:33:40,874
When,l was married....

635
01:33:45,353 --> 01:33:45,910
lt isn't here also!

636
01:33:46,687 --> 01:33:49,212
Excuse me sir! did you see
my water jug?...water jug?!

637
01:33:49,624 --> 01:33:50,716
How do l know,if you ask me?

638
01:33:51,092 --> 01:33:52,218
Go and search,where you
had lost it?

639
01:33:54,362 --> 01:33:55,124
What happened to it?

640
01:38:11,552 --> 01:38:13,543
Look,Sankarabharanam has
come here rolling?

641
01:38:13,821 --> 01:38:15,721
Poor soul,may be interested
in learning pop music!

642
01:38:15,923 --> 01:38:16,912
What do you say,master?

643
01:38:17,291 --> 01:38:21,421
l am saying howling & making noise
at midnight is wrong

644
01:38:22,329 --> 01:38:23,796
Noise and shrieks at midnight?!

645
01:38:26,333 --> 01:38:31,430
Learning for 24 hours a day also you
can't learn even 10% of the pop music!

646
01:38:32,306 --> 01:38:33,739
Have you taken it to be
your 'Prologing Music'?

647
01:38:34,174 --> 01:38:36,108
Learning the 7 Notes by heart

648
01:38:36,443 --> 01:38:38,570
lt isn't like for hours stretching
& pulling one single note!

649
01:38:38,979 --> 01:38:42,847
Your style of Music can be
learnt just like that!

650
01:38:43,250 --> 01:38:44,444
..But our music isn't
like that!

651
01:38:45,819 --> 01:38:47,116
..lt's an ocean..
in that..

652
01:38:49,657 --> 01:38:52,626
Hey! it's useless telling all
this to an illiterate!

653
01:38:53,193 --> 01:38:57,459
Mr.Shastri,please sing your
music go...go please go!

654
01:38:57,932 --> 01:38:59,297
ls it so difficult,that music?

655
01:39:00,267 --> 01:39:01,234
Difficult? its great difficult!

656
01:39:01,769 --> 01:39:04,795
For you to sing 3 words
you've to toil hard for it!

657
01:39:05,639 --> 01:39:07,937
ls it? alright sing
a few lines!

658
01:40:35,529 --> 01:40:37,929
You called our music as
very silly & easy

659
01:40:38,399 --> 01:40:41,300
l'll hum a Raga
please try it!

660
01:41:27,915 --> 01:41:31,146
Music doesn't have differences
of Language & Regions!

661
01:41:31,618 --> 01:41:33,609
lt's an Eternal Flow
of Nectar!

662
01:41:34,655 --> 01:41:38,853
Man from any Caste from
any Religion or any Country!

663
01:41:39,059 --> 01:41:41,220
...Can quench his musical
thirst in that Eternal Flow!

664
01:41:41,762 --> 01:41:48,395
Who are we to decide about
one music as high and other as low!

665
01:41:49,336 --> 01:41:53,432
Without ever trying to learn our
music and traditions!

666
01:41:53,841 --> 01:41:57,038
Your Ridiculing it is
sheer stupidity!

667
01:41:59,279 --> 01:42:01,975
When many foreigners have
accepted the greatness of our music!

668
01:42:02,282 --> 01:42:06,742
..And have been trying to learn
our Traditional Music!

669
01:42:07,454 --> 01:42:11,982
Children fo this country
ridiculing our own music!

670
01:42:12,659 --> 01:42:14,786
..ls like the crime of
abusing one's own mother!

671
01:42:15,529 --> 01:42:17,053
..And a sin like hating
one's own mother!

672
01:42:26,440 --> 01:42:27,236
Pack one kg!

673
01:42:34,381 --> 01:42:35,245
Cost of a biscuit packet sir?

674
01:42:35,516 --> 01:42:36,107
Rs 1 .25 paise!

675
01:42:36,316 --> 01:42:36,839
Give me one!

676
01:42:37,684 --> 01:42:39,743
Subbaiah! l've come to you
for a small obligation!

677
01:42:40,387 --> 01:42:42,014
What? do you need
money again?

678
01:42:42,890 --> 01:42:43,356
Yes!

679
01:42:45,092 --> 01:42:48,858
Sir,how many times can l give
you money on your mortgaged house

680
01:42:50,931 --> 01:42:53,024
Till now,you've given me a lot
l don't deny it!

681
01:42:54,067 --> 01:42:56,365
l am keeping account of
everything!

682
01:42:57,171 --> 01:42:58,968
Some day l'll settle your account
and only then l'll go!

683
01:42:59,673 --> 01:43:01,004
Sir,lts not that,you'll cheat me?

684
01:43:01,508 --> 01:43:02,873
How can you repay it?

685
01:43:03,177 --> 01:43:04,769
All you have is expenses and
not a pie as income!

686
01:43:05,379 --> 01:43:08,439
Alright,lf you don't want to
give it,l'll not force you

687
01:43:09,082 --> 01:43:09,548
l'll go!

688
01:43:09,816 --> 01:43:10,578
Wait sir!

689
01:43:11,385 --> 01:43:14,377
l can understand under what
circumstances,you had asked for it

690
01:43:16,790 --> 01:43:17,882
Keep this Rs 300!

691
01:43:33,507 --> 01:43:34,064
Take it madam

692
01:44:02,536 --> 01:44:03,400
What's this,Gopalam?

693
01:44:07,407 --> 01:44:08,601
...You're missing the beat!

694
01:44:09,343 --> 01:44:12,710
Missing the beat was because of
the mistake l committed sir!

695
01:44:13,547 --> 01:44:14,912
l ditched you & came off!

696
01:44:16,016 --> 01:44:19,144
Sir,for 12 years these hands
never had any work!

697
01:44:20,621 --> 01:44:26,924
Before l die,atleast for once l
must play perscussion to your music!

698
01:44:28,028 --> 01:44:30,019
...l've been praying to all God's
for that oppurtunity sir!

699
01:44:31,298 --> 01:44:33,129
lt's not the question of you
getting an oppurtunity!

700
01:44:33,867 --> 01:44:37,200
People are not fortunate enough
to hear Good music

701
01:44:38,505 --> 01:44:40,473
But,Gopalam this will not
continue forever!

702
01:44:41,208 --> 01:44:44,609
Again,the Traditional music
will get back its glory!

703
01:44:45,412 --> 01:44:47,243
Gopalam,and that day
is not too far!

704
01:44:48,849 --> 01:44:52,478
You've a rock like confidence
so you feel like that

705
01:44:53,353 --> 01:44:58,347
Sir,but after seeing you live
like a king & seeing you now

706
01:44:58,558 --> 01:45:00,287
..My heart is being overwhelmed
by deep sorrow!

707
01:45:01,762 --> 01:45:05,425
Madman! though the property l
had earned vanished away!

708
01:45:06,366 --> 01:45:08,994
..The God given voice
hasn't diminished!

709
01:45:10,203 --> 01:45:13,263
l don't regret on the day l
don't have food!

710
01:45:14,408 --> 01:45:15,841
..l'll regret only the day
l don't sing!

711
01:45:22,215 --> 01:45:25,616
Take this money Gopalam

712
01:45:26,486 --> 01:45:29,080
Sir,are you giving me charity
after taking loan?

713
01:45:30,290 --> 01:45:34,920
Gopalam,we had shared good times
let's share bad times also

714
01:45:35,429 --> 01:45:39,263
Take it...come on
take it!

715
01:46:11,365 --> 01:46:13,890
Though when she was alive
she was hated as a street woman!

716
01:46:14,901 --> 01:46:17,301
l felt really sorry for your
mother before her death!

717
01:46:18,238 --> 01:46:19,899
She died after being
bedridden poor thing!

718
01:46:20,874 --> 01:46:23,069
Once your mother fell ill
your uncle disappeared!

719
01:46:23,844 --> 01:46:28,076
After that she had an unwept
and unsung death!

720
01:46:29,049 --> 01:46:33,418
She had great desire of seeing
you once before her death

721
01:46:34,020 --> 01:46:36,989
But,what was the use of it?she
died without her wish fulfilled

722
01:46:37,791 --> 01:46:41,887
Before dying she bequethed
all her property to you!

723
01:46:45,198 --> 01:46:46,096
Here! take these papers!

724
01:46:47,134 --> 01:46:48,761
Sir,l don't know have any need
for this property now?

725
01:46:49,870 --> 01:46:51,667
Till now,l had laboured
to earn my living!

726
01:46:52,706 --> 01:46:54,537
l've sent Sankaram to the place
where he deserves to be!

727
01:46:55,809 --> 01:46:58,107
Sir,l don't have desire
on anything now!

728
01:46:59,813 --> 01:47:00,575
May be it is true!

729
01:47:01,615 --> 01:47:06,450
But,if you don't want,you can
use it for some good cause,isn't it?

730
01:47:18,098 --> 01:47:22,091
..You're interested in fine tuning
your instruments....

731
01:47:22,669 --> 01:47:25,502
..But you're not at all concerned
about your daughter's life

732
01:47:27,073 --> 01:47:28,370
This is in fine tune

733
01:47:28,975 --> 01:47:31,136
..l've seen a very good match
for your daughter!

734
01:47:32,579 --> 01:47:36,572
Seen it,isn't it? till now you
had seen may good matches?

735
01:47:36,817 --> 01:47:40,913
Look,look l am warning you first
to stop ridiculing me

736
01:47:41,354 --> 01:47:44,687
Like the match's before that
grooms father was cook!

737
01:47:45,058 --> 01:47:48,152
..And this groom's mothers
background isn't good!

738
01:47:48,562 --> 01:47:50,757
Citing such silly reasons,if you
refuse this match!

739
01:47:51,331 --> 01:47:52,525
..l'll not keep quiet!

740
01:47:53,967 --> 01:47:57,562
Now,this boy is multilingual
and handsome too!

741
01:47:57,938 --> 01:47:59,166
Good & cultured

742
01:47:59,606 --> 01:48:02,598
Except a grandmother he doesn't
have parents! poor boy!

743
01:48:02,976 --> 01:48:07,276
He joined the school in our town
and as my neighbour very recently!

744
01:48:07,481 --> 01:48:10,006
Look,hey! Sankaram!

745
01:48:10,383 --> 01:48:13,181
l & my wife both have
liked him very much!

746
01:48:13,487 --> 01:48:16,354
l thought of arranging the
marriage myself....but..

747
01:48:16,857 --> 01:48:20,020
This generation children if they don't
see each other it may not be good!

748
01:48:20,227 --> 01:48:21,455
What sir? is it my
sister's marriage?

749
01:48:21,661 --> 01:48:23,128
Yes! this time it'll be
settled definitely!

750
01:48:24,097 --> 01:48:25,496
Arrange everything!

751
01:48:26,566 --> 01:48:29,160
So,it may not be that good,since
you're father of the bride!

752
01:48:29,369 --> 01:48:31,735
lf l don't show you the boy
you may be feel bad,so only...

753
01:48:32,138 --> 01:48:36,438
Even though being a bosom pal taking
undue advantage may not be good so!

754
01:48:37,010 --> 01:48:42,607
Without giving you a hint,proceeding
myself not be that good,so..

755
01:48:43,083 --> 01:48:45,643
l have told my wife to
bring them here!

756
01:48:46,052 --> 01:48:47,576
They'll be arriving here at
any moment!

757
01:48:48,121 --> 01:48:50,521
This ceremony of bride seeing
is just a namesake!

758
01:48:50,924 --> 01:48:53,222
Look,hey! l am now giving
you a second warning!

759
01:48:53,527 --> 01:48:54,221
lf you refuse it citing silly
reasons,it won't be good!

760
01:48:57,097 --> 01:49:01,625
Crazy man,who are we to stop
marriage,if it is destined?

761
01:49:02,402 --> 01:49:05,565
Won't l be happy if my

763
01:49:13,046 --> 01:49:14,104
Stop..man!..stop!

764
01:49:16,016 --> 01:49:17,711
Come in Aunty,this is
the house!

765
01:49:18,418 --> 01:49:19,442
Come....get down!

766
01:49:19,686 --> 01:49:22,246
Look! you've brought me
here forcibly!

767
01:49:22,889 --> 01:49:25,824
l am warning you,l'll never
marry this girl!

768
01:49:26,293 --> 01:49:27,317
Keep quiet boy!

769
01:49:27,861 --> 01:49:31,558
Fool,consider it as your luck to
become son-in-law of Mr.Shastri!

770
01:49:31,965 --> 01:49:32,431
Get down

771
01:49:32,966 --> 01:49:33,432
Yes,get down

772
01:49:34,401 --> 01:49:35,959
What's he saying Aunty?

773
01:49:36,870 --> 01:49:41,102
Nothing! he was saying that the
house is very beautiful

774
01:49:41,808 --> 01:49:43,207
Look! they've arrived!....

775
01:49:43,410 --> 01:49:44,434
Come..come...come

776
01:49:44,844 --> 01:49:47,005
Kamakshi! you go and look
after the girl-alright!

777
01:49:47,213 --> 01:49:48,271
Come...come...Hey...come on!

778
01:49:49,049 --> 01:49:51,540
Hey! Sankaram! he's groom
Mr.Kameshwara Rao

779
01:49:52,218 --> 01:49:53,617
Your father-in-law
Sankara Shastri!

780
01:49:54,521 --> 01:49:56,955
Did you see him at anytime?

781
01:49:57,157 --> 01:50:00,092
Sir,he's a kid,where would
he have seen him?

782
01:50:01,127 --> 01:50:05,587
l used to dream of hearing
this sir's music in my young age

783
01:50:06,833 --> 01:50:09,927
My husband never used
to take me out!

784
01:50:10,937 --> 01:50:13,201
With that,my wish has
left unfulfilled!

785
01:50:14,574 --> 01:50:18,977
They used say in our times that he's
a heir to Goddess ofLearning

786
01:50:20,246 --> 01:50:23,044
After so many years of life
atlast l could meet him!

787
01:50:23,683 --> 01:50:27,175
what meeting him? now you're going
to become his relative!

788
01:50:27,520 --> 01:50:28,145
Sit down

789
01:50:29,689 --> 01:50:32,123
That is definitely a boon of our
past life's goods deeds!

790
01:50:32,892 --> 01:50:36,350
Sir,l am not telling this just
because he's my grandson

791
01:50:36,796 --> 01:50:37,785
...My Kamudu is....

792
01:50:38,965 --> 01:50:39,431
What?

793
01:50:40,133 --> 01:50:41,701
Why are you calling me as Kamudu?
can't you call me as Kameshwara!

794
01:50:41,701 --> 01:50:42,258
You keep quiet!

795
01:50:43,303 --> 01:50:47,364
My Kamudu has great
respect for elders!

796
01:50:48,842 --> 01:50:51,402
Did you hear? he has
great respect for elders!

797
01:50:52,345 --> 01:50:54,313
Sir,he doesn't have any
bad habits

798
01:50:55,181 --> 01:50:57,809
Did you hear? it seems he
doesn't have any bad habits!

799
01:50:59,519 --> 01:51:02,613
Except that he eats a left over
porridge in the morning!

800
01:51:03,123 --> 01:51:05,023
..He doesn't have any habit
of taking coffee or tea!

801
01:51:06,026 --> 01:51:10,588
How lucky it is now a days to get a
porridge eating son-in-law

802
01:51:18,304 --> 01:51:21,171
My child! come
come sit down!

803
01:51:27,013 --> 01:51:28,207
Hey! the girl has come....

804
01:51:29,849 --> 01:51:31,749
Aunty tell him to lift his head
and look at the girl

805
01:51:32,852 --> 01:51:34,012
Sarada,you too look at him!

806
01:51:35,922 --> 01:51:39,380
Look at her,why are you feeling
shy like a bride?

807
01:51:39,859 --> 01:51:40,325
Look!

808
01:52:19,566 --> 01:52:20,760
My child,what is your name?

809
01:52:23,403 --> 01:52:23,869
ls it?

810
01:52:25,739 --> 01:52:26,933
So,you've been named after
Goddess of Learning

811
01:52:28,174 --> 01:52:32,372
You said it right our girl is
re-incarnate of Goddess of learning

812
01:52:33,246 --> 01:52:37,342
She sings very well,she has
education to write letters to her husband

813
01:52:38,818 --> 01:52:43,221
Master! if you like my sister
then,take the glass-glass!

814
01:52:54,868 --> 01:52:58,702
Sister,if you like him,take
the steel glass!

815
01:53:12,185 --> 01:53:14,517
Did you see her nicely?
did you like the girl?

816
01:53:17,190 --> 01:53:20,057
What's there in his liking or
disliking?

817
01:53:20,326 --> 01:53:22,453
He's a young boy!
what does he know?

818
01:53:23,229 --> 01:53:27,529
Sir,Even if she doesn't know
to cook also,l've no objection!

819
01:53:28,334 --> 01:53:31,861
She has a great property of
music accrued hereditorily

820
01:53:32,272 --> 01:53:33,637
That's enough for me sir!

821
01:53:34,374 --> 01:53:37,343
l don't have the capacity to
ask that great man to sing!

822
01:53:38,111 --> 01:53:41,877
lf his daughter sings a song
l'll think that he has sung it!

823
01:53:42,715 --> 01:53:44,683
What my child? will you
sing a song?

824
01:53:45,218 --> 01:53:45,684
Sister....

825
01:58:39,245 --> 01:58:40,473
What is the Raga
you were singing?

826
01:58:40,713 --> 01:58:41,805
..And what is the note
your singing?

827
01:58:42,715 --> 01:58:44,182
How did Rishabam come
into pure Hindolam Raga?

828
01:58:52,959 --> 01:58:55,484
Come on tell me,what is
Ascent of Raga Hindolam?

829
01:59:01,200 --> 01:59:01,666
Descent?

830
01:59:04,570 --> 01:59:05,662
Then,how did that Rishabam
come into it?

831
01:59:06,606 --> 01:59:10,337
Don't you have any senses to
adulterate Ragas?

832
01:59:12,712 --> 01:59:14,407
Really,if Vrishabam
comes into it then....

833
01:59:14,747 --> 01:59:17,113
What's that?
Vrishabam or Rishabam?

834
01:59:18,684 --> 01:59:19,708
lt's Rishabam sir,Rishabam!

835
01:59:20,353 --> 01:59:21,547
A tongue slip!

836
01:59:21,954 --> 01:59:23,182
lf a rishabam comes then
it'll not be a Hindolam

837
01:59:24,056 --> 01:59:24,818
..lt may be Charukesi!

838
01:59:25,324 --> 01:59:25,756
Charukesi?!

839
01:59:28,227 --> 01:59:29,888
No..how can it be
Charukesi!

840
01:59:30,863 --> 01:59:32,023
Coffee!....lt may be Kafi

841
01:59:32,398 --> 01:59:33,365
First,you get up from there!

842
01:59:34,734 --> 01:59:35,200
Get up!

843
01:59:37,003 --> 01:59:39,301
When you can't pronance a
word Rishabam?

844
01:59:39,672 --> 01:59:42,072
What right do you have to
talk about music?

845
01:59:42,441 --> 01:59:45,535
lf you know it then talk
otherwise keep shut!

846
01:59:45,745 --> 01:59:46,211
That's not...

847
01:59:46,579 --> 01:59:48,513
Sir,we'll meet you
sometime later!

848
01:59:48,714 --> 01:59:49,544
Not necessary!

849
01:59:52,318 --> 01:59:54,946
You don't have the necessity!

850
01:59:55,521 --> 01:59:56,920
But,Sarada needs a marriage!

851
01:59:57,557 --> 01:59:59,491
She needs a companion
she needs a home of her own

852
02:00:00,193 --> 02:00:03,321
Why do you want to marry her to
a Musician & spoil her life?

853
02:00:03,963 --> 02:00:05,362
Aren't you satified with
your happiness?

854
02:00:06,666 --> 02:00:09,658
ln music you're a Genius
an expert in Sankarabharanam

855
02:00:10,169 --> 02:00:11,898
You've got yourself the fame
of wearing a Garter!

856
02:00:12,438 --> 02:00:15,271
ls there anyone to call you for
a programme & pay you a Re 1 ?

857
02:00:15,875 --> 02:00:17,570
How many years have passed
since you wore clean clothes?

858
02:00:18,177 --> 02:00:21,044
How many years've passed since you
ate 2 square meals contentfully?

859
02:00:21,714 --> 02:00:24,911
Are you able to buy atleast a
blouse for your daughter?

860
02:00:25,785 --> 02:00:28,083
Why are you still proud
about yourself?

861
02:00:29,589 --> 02:00:36,153
Kalidas cried that fate doesn't make
him to write poetry to uninterested!

862
02:00:36,963 --> 02:00:38,760
When people don't want
your music?

863
02:00:39,131 --> 02:00:41,429
When that music can't earn
you a decent living?

864
02:00:44,103 --> 02:00:44,762
You've it! okay!

865
02:00:45,171 --> 02:00:48,868
But,who has given you the right to
spoil her life with your desire?

866
02:00:52,411 --> 02:00:55,938
Getting dejected she'll
commit suicide!

867
02:00:56,482 --> 02:00:59,645
And taking her body into your
arms,you can then sing!

868
02:01:02,521 --> 02:01:04,113
Even God can't save you
my friend!

869
02:02:25,871 --> 02:02:27,964
What is the Raga you're singing
what is that note?

870
02:03:27,533 --> 02:03:28,591
l don't know,what's
that Kamu?

871
02:03:29,602 --> 02:03:32,571
Without keeping quiet,l had only
insisted on the girl to sing?

872
02:03:33,806 --> 02:03:35,273
...And put her in a fix!

873
02:03:35,708 --> 02:03:37,437
You put that girl in a fix
that's okay!

874
02:03:38,277 --> 02:03:39,539
Unnecessarily l am in
a fix

875
02:03:40,079 --> 02:03:40,545
Fool!

876
02:03:40,946 --> 02:03:45,007
Without keeping shut,why did
you talk unnecessarily?

877
02:03:46,018 --> 02:03:48,612
l had spent a fortune to
teach you music!

878
02:03:51,957 --> 02:03:53,948
Couldn't you pronounce
a simple Rishabam?

879
02:03:54,827 --> 02:03:55,953
lf it hasn't been your fate?!

880
02:03:56,495 --> 02:03:58,793
You don't grumble!not that
l wasn't able to!

881
02:03:59,465 --> 02:04:03,799
lf you want,test me now,l'll tell
everything Raga,Ascents & Descents!

882
02:04:05,137 --> 02:04:07,697
Suddenly when he become angry
l got shivers!

883
02:04:07,940 --> 02:04:09,430
..ln that l blabbered
something in haste

884
02:04:10,209 --> 02:04:10,675
..That's all!

885
02:04:11,444 --> 02:04:16,472
Even lf we penance for 10 lifes
we'll never get a match like that?

886
02:04:17,650 --> 02:04:19,208
We spoiled with our
own hands!

887
02:04:20,119 --> 02:04:20,551
Poor Boy!

888
02:04:21,620 --> 02:04:26,216
l am more sad than you in this
how do you know it?

889
02:04:28,461 --> 02:04:30,326
He told me to get out because
l didn't know music,isn't it?

890
02:04:32,364 --> 02:04:32,830
Let me see it!

891
02:06:11,497 --> 02:06:14,523
Rs 5000! your account is settled
isn't it?

892
02:06:14,967 --> 02:06:16,935
Settled madam,wait here,l'll
get the receipt!

893
02:06:17,503 --> 02:06:20,563
Mr.Subbaiah! l don't
want receipt

894
02:06:21,240 --> 02:06:25,176
lt's enough if you say once that
Shastri's account is settled!

895
02:06:25,377 --> 02:06:26,002
What's that madam?

896
02:06:26,278 --> 02:06:30,806
Look! ln future,whenever Mr.Shastri
asks for money,give him

897
02:06:31,250 --> 02:06:32,410
..l'll settle all his dues!

898
02:06:32,651 --> 02:06:33,140
As you say,madam

899
02:06:33,652 --> 02:06:34,118
l'll go now!

900
02:06:39,391 --> 02:06:44,294
Mr.Shastri is coming here
don't tell him anything about me

901
02:06:45,965 --> 02:06:47,193
Come sir...please come!

902
02:06:48,667 --> 02:06:49,099
Please sit down

903
02:06:54,106 --> 02:06:56,973
l've already taken a lot of
loans from you!

904
02:06:58,277 --> 02:07:00,939
l thought l should never come
to you on that pretext!

905
02:07:02,014 --> 02:07:03,481
But,l couldn't avoid it!

906
02:07:04,016 --> 02:07:04,948
Sir,why are you saying
like that?

907
02:07:05,584 --> 02:07:06,209
Do you need money sir?

908
02:07:10,222 --> 02:07:11,382
l am arranging my daughters
marriage!

909
02:07:14,994 --> 02:07:17,690
This time,you don't have to
lend me an just word!

910
02:07:19,331 --> 02:07:20,855
Have you seen this?

911
02:07:22,134 --> 02:07:24,625
l never considered this
as an ornament!

912
02:07:25,938 --> 02:07:27,997
This is also a part of
my body...

913
02:07:29,008 --> 02:07:33,445
And thought that lt'll go

the Art of this Great Exponent!

966
02:14:10,442 --> 02:14:11,909

...l'll tell about the distinction
about this man!

..They used get thrilled
by hearing it!

Pomp and Grandeour

But with time,many changes
had crept into music!

02:14:44,843 --> 02:14:47,209
For example,shall l embrace you

Shall l bite you or chew you

..Seeing such a stupendous
reception for his music
