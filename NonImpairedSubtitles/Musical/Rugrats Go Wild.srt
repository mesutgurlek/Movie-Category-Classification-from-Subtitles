1
00:00:38,038 --> 00:00:39,198
Wake up.

2
00:01:23,016 --> 00:01:25,576
Come along, faithful viewers,

3
00:01:25,652 --> 00:01:29,782
on our journey
through the drain forest

4
00:01:29,856 --> 00:01:33,257
as we search
for that very unusable creature,

5
00:01:33,326 --> 00:01:35,726
the three-toed sloth.

6
00:01:38,064 --> 00:01:39,531
Ah, there he is!

7
00:01:39,599 --> 00:01:41,533
Teething with life.

8
00:01:41,601 --> 00:01:43,592
Let's get a closer look,
shall we?

9
00:01:43,670 --> 00:01:45,160
Oh, no, you don't!

10
00:01:45,238 --> 00:01:46,671
Cut! Cut!

11
00:01:46,739 --> 00:01:48,673
Don't worry, Chuckie.

12
00:01:48,741 --> 00:01:52,575
I'm Nigel Strawberry,
wild aminal expert.

13
00:01:54,180 --> 00:01:57,115
And 'cause
I'm an eggsbert, I say,

14
00:01:57,183 --> 00:01:59,447
everybody into the truck!

15
00:02:01,554 --> 00:02:02,816
Go, go, go.

16
00:02:02,889 --> 00:02:05,915
Jump Tommy, jump!

17
00:02:05,992 --> 00:02:07,926
Say something, Nigel.

18
00:02:07,994 --> 00:02:11,020
I can hear the tiger's
running feets,

19
00:02:11,097 --> 00:02:13,122
see his sharp teeths,

20
00:02:13,199 --> 00:02:16,464
and oh, oh...
I feel a cool breeze.

21
00:02:32,085 --> 00:02:33,916
Crocogator!

22
00:02:39,726 --> 00:02:41,956
Not to worry, guys!

23
00:02:50,470 --> 00:02:53,462
Oh, no! It's coming back!

24
00:02:53,540 --> 00:02:55,167
But that was my onliest
cute toy!

25
00:02:55,241 --> 00:02:57,471
Then feed him Phil.

26
00:02:57,544 --> 00:02:58,636
I heard that.

27
00:02:58,711 --> 00:03:00,269
That way! Through the swamp!

28
00:03:04,617 --> 00:03:07,518
Nigel, why are we sinking?

29
00:03:07,587 --> 00:03:09,851
Quitsand! I should
have knowed!

30
00:03:09,923 --> 00:03:11,788
Guys, hang on to me!

31
00:03:20,900 --> 00:03:23,425
What are you diaperbags
screaming about?

32
00:03:23,503 --> 00:03:24,834
We're about to get eated

33
00:03:24,904 --> 00:03:27,270
by that ferocious
Siferean tiger.

34
00:03:27,340 --> 00:03:30,173
Were you pretending
to be Nigel Strawberry

35
00:03:30,243 --> 00:03:31,574
again, Tommy?

36
00:03:31,644 --> 00:03:33,578
Yeah. He's my hero,

37
00:03:33,646 --> 00:03:36,615
and when I grow up,
I want to be just like him.

38
00:03:36,683 --> 00:03:38,810
Pickles,
you're no Nigel Strawberry.

39
00:03:38,885 --> 00:03:41,547
You're not even a Nigel...

40
00:03:41,621 --> 00:03:43,088
...Raspberry!

41
00:03:43,156 --> 00:03:45,590
You're never gonna have
real adventures.

42
00:03:45,658 --> 00:03:49,253
You're just a backyard baby
with a diaper full of dreams.

43
00:03:51,431 --> 00:03:53,729
Wow. She's mean.

44
00:03:53,800 --> 00:03:56,633
Now, who wants to go look
for cookies under stuff?

45
00:03:56,703 --> 00:03:57,795
I do!

46
00:03:57,870 --> 00:03:59,804
Okay, come on.
Follow me.

47
00:04:08,147 --> 00:04:10,240
The panthera onca,

48
00:04:10,316 --> 00:04:13,649
commonly known as the jaguar,
seems determined

49
00:04:13,720 --> 00:04:15,654
to feast on my nether regions.

50
00:04:15,722 --> 00:04:17,053
But not to worry.

51
00:04:20,126 --> 00:04:21,753
Well, faithful viewers,

52
00:04:21,828 --> 00:04:24,388
our journey was
a smashing success.

53
00:04:26,833 --> 00:04:29,802
Until next time,
this is Sir Nigel Thornberry

54
00:04:29,869 --> 00:04:33,532
of Sir Nigel Thornberry's
Animal World.

55
00:04:33,606 --> 00:04:35,540
Back! Back! Back!

56
00:04:35,608 --> 00:04:38,076
Why, hello, Scout.

57
00:04:38,144 --> 00:04:40,078
Boy, rest your eyes
for a second,

58
00:04:40,146 --> 00:04:41,670
at old Thornberry's
gator bait.

59
00:04:41,748 --> 00:04:42,806
Hey.

60
00:04:44,083 --> 00:04:46,483
Boy, that Sir Nigel gets
in some real scrapes

61
00:04:46,552 --> 00:04:49,385
out there in the wild,
but he always manages

62
00:04:49,455 --> 00:04:51,889
to wiggle out of trouble
somehow.

63
00:04:54,861 --> 00:04:56,385
Oh, and, Jonathan, don't think

64
00:04:56,462 --> 00:04:58,794
that just because I'm on
a Luxury Lipschitz Cruise

65
00:04:58,865 --> 00:05:00,196
in the South China Seas,

66
00:05:00,266 --> 00:05:02,291
I won't be checking messages,

67
00:05:02,368 --> 00:05:04,199
E-mailing, and carrier
pigeons on the hour.

68
00:05:04,270 --> 00:05:06,670
Honey, I thought we were
going to leave work behind

69
00:05:06,739 --> 00:05:07,899
for seven
fun-filled days.

70
00:05:07,974 --> 00:05:09,839
Silly, it's
not all work.

71
00:05:09,909 --> 00:05:11,900
I've signed up for
every spa treatment

72
00:05:12,011 --> 00:05:14,138
culminating in
the Salem Retreat,

73
00:05:14,213 --> 00:05:16,204
where you're pressed
between layers of hot rocks

74
00:05:16,282 --> 00:05:17,909
and ripe cranberries.

75
00:05:17,984 --> 00:05:19,645
Sounds bewitching.

76
00:05:19,719 --> 00:05:21,118
But aren't we all
going to be busy

77
00:05:21,187 --> 00:05:22,882
with our children?

78
00:05:22,955 --> 00:05:24,752
Deed, that's
what the Kidsatorium is for.

79
00:05:24,824 --> 00:05:26,758
Each morning
we drop off the pups

80
00:05:26,826 --> 00:05:27,826
and head for
the All-Day Breakfast Buffet.

81
00:05:30,872 --> 00:05:32,240
I hear they make a mean egg yolk omelet...

81
00:05:33,240 --> 00:05:34,434
Ooh!

82
00:05:34,508 --> 00:05:37,272
...dipped with five kinds
of sausage.

83
00:05:38,578 --> 00:05:40,045
Whoa!

84
00:05:42,315 --> 00:05:43,509
We signed up the kids

85
00:05:43,583 --> 00:05:45,778
for "Pirate Play
and Pillage" class.

86
00:05:45,852 --> 00:05:47,877
It teaches tolerance
for the peg-legged.

87
00:05:47,954 --> 00:05:50,650
Well, I'm going to use
the whole seven kid-free days

88
00:05:50,724 --> 00:05:51,782
to reshape my physique.

89
00:05:51,892 --> 00:05:52,892
Could happen.

90
00:05:53,068 --> 00:05:54,932
The Earth was created in six.

90
00:05:59,173 --> 00:06:00,299
Everyone all set?

91
00:06:00,374 --> 00:06:02,774
I think we all should thank
my husband Stu

92
00:06:02,844 --> 00:06:05,108
for arranging this
wonderful getaway.

93
00:06:05,179 --> 00:06:06,476
No. You can thank me

94
00:06:06,547 --> 00:06:07,775
by having the time
of your lives.

95
00:06:09,550 --> 00:06:10,676
Welcome!

96
00:06:10,752 --> 00:06:13,152
Bienvenue! Willkommen!

97
00:06:13,221 --> 00:06:14,279
Welcome aboard

98
00:06:14,355 --> 00:06:18,348
the world-renowned
Dr. Lipschitz Cruise!

99
00:06:21,229 --> 00:06:23,493
Stu must have taken Spike

100
00:06:23,564 --> 00:06:25,122
for one last potty run.

101
00:06:25,199 --> 00:06:27,360
I-I'm sure he'll be right back.

102
00:06:27,435 --> 00:06:28,367
He better.

103
00:06:28,436 --> 00:06:30,700
He's got all our tickets.

104
00:06:30,772 --> 00:06:33,570
That sure is a nice cambera,
Susie.

105
00:06:33,641 --> 00:06:34,767
Thanks, Tommy.

106
00:06:34,842 --> 00:06:36,036
My mommy got it for me

107
00:06:36,110 --> 00:06:38,340
so she can see everything
she's missing.

108
00:06:38,412 --> 00:06:40,471
How come
she and your daddy can't come

109
00:06:40,548 --> 00:06:41,776
on the cruise with us?

110
00:06:41,849 --> 00:06:43,783
Well, my mommy's getting
a special award

111
00:06:43,851 --> 00:06:46,149
'cause she 'scovered
a new disease,

112
00:06:46,220 --> 00:06:47,710
and my daddy's cutting
the ribbon

113
00:06:47,789 --> 00:06:49,347
at the Dummi Bear Theme Park
opening.

114
00:06:49,423 --> 00:06:50,947
But I wanted to come
with you guys.

115
00:06:51,025 --> 00:06:51,957
And we're

116
00:06:52,026 --> 00:06:55,393
so glad you did,
Susie Carmichael.

117
00:06:55,463 --> 00:06:56,430
Now, here!

118
00:06:56,497 --> 00:06:59,125
Hold the spotlight
on Lounge Singer Cynthia.

119
00:07:01,569 --> 00:07:04,834
Dresses and shoes
are the only things

120
00:07:04,906 --> 00:07:08,137
That I'll share...

121
00:07:08,242 --> 00:07:09,368
That's my rules.

122
00:07:09,443 --> 00:07:11,536
Oh! I wonder if it's too late

123
00:07:11,612 --> 00:07:12,874
to call my mommy.

124
00:07:17,084 --> 00:07:18,676
Hey, The ship's sailing
without us!

125
00:07:18,753 --> 00:07:19,651
Wait!

126
00:07:21,255 --> 00:07:22,279
Isn't that our ship?

127
00:07:22,356 --> 00:07:23,323
Wait!

128
00:07:30,264 --> 00:07:31,526
Whoa!

129
00:07:32,867 --> 00:07:34,459
Ahoy, mates!

130
00:07:34,535 --> 00:07:38,596
Captain Stu at your service!

131
00:07:38,673 --> 00:07:40,265
Climb aboard for seven

132
00:07:40,341 --> 00:07:42,935
fun-filled days
on the S.S. Nancy.

133
00:07:43,010 --> 00:07:44,944
No fancy packaged tour.

134
00:07:45,012 --> 00:07:46,070
Just the thrill

135
00:07:46,147 --> 00:07:48,877
of the open sea,
the smell of the salt air,

136
00:07:48,950 --> 00:07:50,918
and the joy
of close friends

137
00:07:50,985 --> 00:07:52,885
and family.

138
00:07:52,954 --> 00:07:54,819
Drew, hold the shoes.

139
00:08:03,698 --> 00:08:06,963
I'm Queen of the World!

140
00:08:20,648 --> 00:08:23,640
Oh, isn't this a great vacation,
guys?

141
00:08:23,718 --> 00:08:24,810
As long as

142
00:08:24,886 --> 00:08:26,911
the "Queen" doesn't sing...

143
00:08:26,988 --> 00:08:28,615
I'm happy.

144
00:08:28,689 --> 00:08:31,954
And the bestest part is,
we're all togethers.

145
00:08:34,962 --> 00:08:38,659
Ah! This is
just like my bathie.

146
00:08:38,733 --> 00:08:41,463
Only there's no
rubber ducky, and...

147
00:08:41,535 --> 00:08:42,627
I'm not nakie.

148
00:08:42,703 --> 00:08:43,761
There's a ducky.

149
00:08:46,741 --> 00:08:47,833
Well, okay.

150
00:08:47,909 --> 00:08:49,171
Time to get nakie.

151
00:08:49,243 --> 00:08:50,335
Oh.

152
00:08:50,411 --> 00:08:51,469
Nakie!

153
00:09:02,790 --> 00:09:03,984
I can't believe

154
00:09:04,058 --> 00:09:06,424
you did this without
consulting us, Stu.

155
00:09:06,494 --> 00:09:07,927
Look at poor Kira.

156
00:09:07,995 --> 00:09:10,828
This was supposed
to be our honeymoon.

157
00:09:11,933 --> 00:09:12,922
Sorry, Chas.

158
00:09:13,000 --> 00:09:15,833
And here I was hoping
you'd be my first mate.

159
00:09:15,903 --> 00:09:18,235
Me? Really?

160
00:09:18,306 --> 00:09:19,603
Snap out of it, Gilligan.

161
00:09:19,674 --> 00:09:20,663
At the next port,

162
00:09:20,741 --> 00:09:22,402
we're getting off
this rinky-dink tub,

163
00:09:22,476 --> 00:09:24,103
and getting
on the Lipschitz Cruise.

164
00:09:28,449 --> 00:09:29,746
Don't you see?

165
00:09:29,817 --> 00:09:31,114
If we were

166
00:09:31,185 --> 00:09:33,085
on a cruise right now,
we wouldn't be together.

167
00:09:33,154 --> 00:09:35,748
We'd be split up
between the pools, the spas,

168
00:09:35,823 --> 00:09:36,881
and the mile-long buffets.

169
00:09:37,992 --> 00:09:40,790
We're missing
Canadian Bacon Tuesday!

170
00:09:40,861 --> 00:09:42,761
Oh, can't this bait
trap go any faster?

171
00:09:44,098 --> 00:09:45,156
Hello?

172
00:09:45,266 --> 00:09:46,358
Hello?

173
00:09:46,434 --> 00:09:48,402
Is anybody there?

174
00:09:48,469 --> 00:09:51,700
Welcome passengers
to what I like to call

175
00:09:51,772 --> 00:09:53,171
"The Voyage of Your Lifetime!"

176
00:09:53,240 --> 00:09:54,571
Everybody, I'm getting a signal.

177
00:09:54,642 --> 00:09:55,939
It's from the Lipschitz Cruise.

178
00:09:56,010 --> 00:09:57,534
Oh, quick, let
me talk to them.

179
00:09:57,611 --> 00:09:59,704
Mom, are you there?

180
00:09:59,780 --> 00:10:01,975
We're having a little trouble
with the wild child.

181
00:10:02,049 --> 00:10:04,347
Sounds like
a disgruntled passenger.

182
00:10:04,418 --> 00:10:06,648
Oh! Hello, Lipschitz.
Charlotte Pickles here.

183
00:10:06,721 --> 00:10:08,746
Could you send a rescue boat
right away?

184
00:10:08,823 --> 00:10:11,189
We're the squalid little boat
in the middle of the ocean.

185
00:10:11,258 --> 00:10:12,520
Mom?

186
00:10:12,593 --> 00:10:14,788
My muscles are atrophying
as we speak.

187
00:10:14,862 --> 00:10:16,420
Well, we paid
for spa treatments,

188
00:10:16,497 --> 00:10:17,429
and I'm not missing one!

189
00:10:17,498 --> 00:10:18,624
Hey, we're getting a signal
here.

190
00:10:18,699 --> 00:10:20,189
Oh, Dr. Lipschitz,
can you help us?

191
00:10:20,301 --> 00:10:22,292
My wife really needs
to see the ship's doctor.

192
00:10:22,370 --> 00:10:23,598
Huh? Hang on a sec, Mom.

193
00:10:23,671 --> 00:10:26,765
I'm picking up some
lame-o soap opera.

194
00:10:26,841 --> 00:10:28,468
What is it this time, Debbie?

195
00:10:28,542 --> 00:10:29,201
Okay.

196
00:10:29,343 --> 00:10:30,674
I made everyone dinner,

197
00:10:30,745 --> 00:10:32,872
so I shouldn't have
to clean up, too,

198
00:10:32,947 --> 00:10:34,039
right?

199
00:10:34,115 --> 00:10:36,777
Mom, all she did was hand us
a jar of peanut butter.

200
00:10:36,851 --> 00:10:40,116
Uh, can we talk about this
when your father and I get home?

201
00:10:40,187 --> 00:10:41,950
Yeah. Any E.T.A. on that?

202
00:10:42,023 --> 00:10:44,685
'Cause you've been gone
since, like, yesterday.

203
00:10:44,759 --> 00:10:46,420
We're still looking
for the leopard at...

204
00:10:46,494 --> 00:10:47,426
Oh, Nigel!

205
00:10:47,495 --> 00:10:48,826
Over there!
What's that?

206
00:10:48,896 --> 00:10:50,864
That's... I see spots!

207
00:10:50,931 --> 00:10:52,057
Oh!

208
00:10:52,133 --> 00:10:55,068
Watch out for that
limb, dearest.

209
00:10:55,136 --> 00:10:57,536
Here, neofelis nebulosa,

210
00:10:57,605 --> 00:10:59,539
come to Papa.

211
00:10:59,607 --> 00:11:02,132
Hello? I was talking here!

212
00:11:02,209 --> 00:11:03,437
Oh, I'm sorry, Debbie.

213
00:11:03,511 --> 00:11:05,877
Now you're on your own
for dinner tonight.

214
00:11:05,946 --> 00:11:08,176
You know, normal
families

215
00:11:08,282 --> 00:11:10,375
eat dinner together
once in a while.

216
00:11:10,451 --> 00:11:12,976
Marianne, perhaps
I can lure out the leopard

217
00:11:13,054 --> 00:11:16,023
by imitating its mating call.

218
00:11:20,995 --> 00:11:22,428
Okay, so we're not normal.

219
00:11:22,496 --> 00:11:24,430
But as a teen,
I reserve the right

220
00:11:24,498 --> 00:11:26,659
to alternately reject
and embrace my parental units.

221
00:11:26,734 --> 00:11:28,668
Consider us embraced.

222
00:11:28,736 --> 00:11:30,203
Now, keep an eye on Donnie.

223
00:11:30,337 --> 00:11:31,429
It's going to rain,

224
00:11:31,505 --> 00:11:32,904
and you know how he likes mud.

225
00:11:34,375 --> 00:11:35,342
Over and out.

226
00:11:35,409 --> 00:11:37,377
She totally hung up on me.

227
00:11:37,445 --> 00:11:39,310
And I was having
a sensitive moment.

228
00:11:39,380 --> 00:05:53,262
Debbie, you are
so self-centered.

229
00:11:41,444 --> 00:11:43,556
I am not!

229
00:11:44,046 --> 00:11:46,105
Okay, what's the monkey saying
about me?

230
00:11:50,652 --> 00:11:41,785
Mmm.

231
00:12:12,288 --> 00:12:13,721
Oh, that's great.

232
00:12:13,790 --> 00:12:14,722
Oh, it's fine!

233
00:12:14,791 --> 00:12:16,315
Come on, pups,

234
00:12:16,392 --> 00:12:18,485
get underneath.
Come on.

235
00:12:28,037 --> 00:12:30,232
Come on, move it, move it,
move it! Down below!

236
00:12:35,778 --> 00:12:37,803
Oh!

237
00:12:45,788 --> 00:12:47,050
Captain Stu,

238
00:12:47,123 --> 00:12:48,556
I can't hold
the wheel.

239
00:12:48,624 --> 00:12:50,717
Will you stop calling
him captain?

240
00:12:50,793 --> 00:12:53,057
He has no idea
what he's doing!

241
00:12:53,129 --> 00:12:54,790
I do so!

242
00:12:54,864 --> 00:12:56,388
Does anybody know
where the brakes are

243
00:12:56,499 --> 00:12:57,864
on this thing?

244
00:12:57,934 --> 00:13:00,232
Jonathan, why aren't you
answering the phone?

245
00:13:00,303 --> 00:13:02,635
I need you to divert
a tropical storm.

246
00:13:07,810 --> 00:13:10,711
It's a 40-foot wall
of water.

247
00:13:10,780 --> 00:13:12,907
We're going to need
a bigger boat.

248
00:13:12,982 --> 00:13:14,381
Everyone get below!

249
00:13:29,398 --> 00:13:30,365
Phone overboard!

250
00:13:30,500 --> 00:13:31,364
Phone overboard!

251
00:13:31,501 --> 00:13:33,059
Charlotte, forget the phone!

252
00:13:33,135 --> 00:13:34,693
Jonathan!

253
00:14:10,006 --> 00:14:12,668
Well, this is how we came in...

254
00:14:12,742 --> 00:14:13,640
No!

255
00:14:18,080 --> 00:14:19,445
Oh, babies!

256
00:14:19,515 --> 00:14:20,846
Oh, Kimi.

257
00:14:20,917 --> 00:14:22,111
Chuckie, hold on to me.

258
00:14:22,184 --> 00:14:24,516
Why didn't
anybody stop me?

259
00:14:24,587 --> 00:14:26,612
Out of my way!

260
00:14:30,693 --> 00:14:32,320
Where you going?

261
00:14:32,395 --> 00:14:33,453
No, Charlotte!

262
00:14:33,529 --> 00:14:36,430
Charlotte, don't.
I-It's a rental.

263
00:14:42,705 --> 00:14:44,263
Come on!

264
00:14:48,444 --> 00:14:50,241
Right behind you,
boys!

265
00:14:54,884 --> 00:14:57,876
If you like to make a call,
please hang up and try again.

266
00:14:57,954 --> 00:15:00,013
If you need help, hang up...

267
00:15:05,394 --> 00:15:07,726
You're safe!

268
00:15:07,797 --> 00:15:09,162
I got it!

269
00:15:09,231 --> 00:15:11,699
Dil's binky!

270
00:15:11,767 --> 00:15:13,462
Oh, Betty,
thank you.

271
00:15:17,039 --> 00:15:19,200
I thought this might
come in handy, too.

272
00:15:22,411 --> 00:15:24,879
Abandon ship!

273
00:15:34,490 --> 00:15:37,982
I can't help feeling
partially responsible.

274
00:15:49,772 --> 00:15:55,369
There's got to be
a morning after

275
00:15:55,444 --> 00:15:59,642
If we can hold on
through the night...

276
00:15:59,715 --> 00:16:01,546
I know we can.

277
00:16:01,617 --> 00:16:05,485
We have a chance
to find the sunshine...

278
00:16:05,554 --> 00:16:06,987
Come on!

279
00:16:07,056 --> 00:16:12,050
Let's keep on looking
for the light

280
00:16:13,729 --> 00:16:15,196
Spike!

281
00:16:15,264 --> 00:16:16,196
Here, boy!

282
00:16:16,265 --> 00:16:17,527
Spike!

283
00:16:17,600 --> 00:16:19,124
Come over here, Spike.

284
00:16:21,404 --> 00:16:24,339
Cynthia overboard!

285
00:16:24,407 --> 00:16:26,375
Cynthia! No!

286
00:16:30,146 --> 00:16:32,239
No, no, no, no.

287
00:16:32,314 --> 00:16:34,509
-No, no, no, no.
-There, there, Princess.

288
00:16:34,583 --> 00:16:36,517
We've all lost
something today.

289
00:16:36,585 --> 00:16:40,521
Why, I lost my cell phone
with 100 free minutes,

290
00:16:40,589 --> 00:16:42,682
and Daddy lost
his favorite sun visor,

291
00:16:42,758 --> 00:16:45,556
and Uncle Stu lost
all our respect.

292
00:17:10,886 --> 00:17:12,717
Cynthia!

293
00:17:26,702 --> 00:17:28,499
You guys, wake up!

294
00:17:28,571 --> 00:17:31,369
We're at the bacation place.

295
00:17:35,311 --> 00:17:37,245
Ah, that was a good nappie.

296
00:17:37,313 --> 00:17:39,008
It was just like when Mommy

297
00:17:39,081 --> 00:17:41,675
used to rock us to beddie-bye.

298
00:17:41,751 --> 00:17:45,744
Well, I likes a bed
that doesn't move.

299
00:17:49,425 --> 00:17:51,017
Land ho!

300
00:17:51,093 --> 00:17:52,685
Land ho!

301
00:17:52,762 --> 00:17:55,731
I'll never set foot
on water again!

302
00:17:58,567 --> 00:17:59,556
Where are we?

303
00:17:59,635 --> 00:18:00,693
Oh, isn't it obvious?

304
00:18:00,770 --> 00:18:02,431
The palm trees, the white sand,

305
00:18:02,505 --> 00:18:03,665
the crystal blue water...

306
00:18:03,739 --> 00:18:06,469
Why, we've landed
on an island resort.

307
00:18:06,542 --> 00:18:08,066
Place looks pretty deserted.

308
00:18:08,144 --> 00:18:09,076
Oh, Betty.

309
00:18:09,145 --> 00:18:10,976
The best ones always are.

310
00:18:11,046 --> 00:18:13,276
Just look for a cabana boy
carrying towels.

311
00:18:13,349 --> 00:18:14,543
Hello!

312
00:18:14,617 --> 00:18:16,983
I could use a double espresso,
chop-chop.

313
00:18:17,052 --> 00:18:18,644
-Chop-chop...
-Don't worry,

314
00:18:18,721 --> 00:18:19,813
I've got a map.

315
00:18:19,889 --> 00:18:22,119
We'll figure this out.

316
00:18:22,191 --> 00:18:24,489
We left here. We capsized here.

317
00:18:24,560 --> 00:18:26,619
I know exactly where we are.

318
00:18:26,695 --> 00:18:29,357
See? We're on this
tiny little island called...

319
00:18:30,566 --> 00:18:32,830
"Uninhabited."

320
00:18:32,902 --> 00:18:36,565
You mean we're
the only people here?

321
00:18:36,639 --> 00:18:38,504
Well, we'll just have
to get back in the boat

322
00:18:38,574 --> 00:18:39,666
and row to another island.

323
00:18:39,742 --> 00:18:41,004
One with coffee.

324
00:18:41,076 --> 00:18:43,169
Drew, the lifeboat's gone!

325
00:18:43,245 --> 00:18:44,075
-Gone?!
-Where'd it go?

326
00:18:44,146 --> 00:18:45,204
Look, it's way out there.

327
00:18:45,281 --> 00:18:48,045
Wait, ho, ho, oh, great.

328
00:18:48,117 --> 00:18:49,049
We're marooned?

329
00:18:49,118 --> 00:18:50,847
With no food?

330
00:18:50,920 --> 00:18:53,115
How soon before we all
turn cannibal?

331
00:18:53,189 --> 00:18:54,383
I have to get
out of here!

332
00:18:56,759 --> 00:18:59,785
So, "Swiss Family DeVille"
he's not.

333
00:19:07,036 --> 00:19:09,732
Good morning, poodles!

334
00:19:09,805 --> 00:19:12,137
We were up all night

335
00:19:12,208 --> 00:19:13,607
Iooking for that leopard.

336
00:19:13,676 --> 00:19:14,973
Debbie, they're here!

337
00:19:15,044 --> 00:19:16,272
Ta da!

338
00:19:16,345 --> 00:19:20,213
Homemade coconut muffins
and fresh herbal tea.

339
00:19:20,282 --> 00:19:21,749
Debbie, this
is so sweet.

340
00:19:21,817 --> 00:19:23,717
Oh, and these
look heavenly.

341
00:19:25,554 --> 00:19:27,988
Afraid we must
eat and run.

342
00:19:28,057 --> 00:19:29,490
Mmm.

343
00:19:29,558 --> 00:19:31,321
Ooh, really
delicious, honey.

344
00:19:31,393 --> 00:19:33,088
But you guys
just got here!

345
00:19:33,162 --> 00:19:34,823
I know, but the Foundation

346
00:19:34,897 --> 00:19:36,660
is expecting that
footage today,

347
00:19:36,732 --> 00:19:38,427
and we still
haven't got it.

348
00:19:38,500 --> 00:19:41,663
Nigel, I think
we should split up.

349
00:19:41,737 --> 00:19:43,102
Dearest!

350
00:19:43,172 --> 00:19:45,106
I thought we
were so happy.

351
00:19:47,076 --> 00:19:48,566
Oh...

352
00:19:48,644 --> 00:19:50,339
You mean to look

353
00:19:50,412 --> 00:19:52,676
for the leopard,
don't you?

354
00:19:52,748 --> 00:19:54,613
I can't believe this!

355
00:19:54,683 --> 00:19:56,810
You're always working.

356
00:19:56,886 --> 00:19:58,649
When's the last time
we took a vacation?

357
00:19:58,721 --> 00:20:01,519
But, Debbie, we travel
all over the world.

358
00:20:01,590 --> 00:20:04,184
I want a family vacation.

359
00:20:04,260 --> 00:20:07,354
You know, where we fight over
the bar of hotel soap.

360
00:20:07,429 --> 00:20:09,363
And Debbie hogs
all the good towels?

361
00:20:09,431 --> 00:20:10,864
And we order
room service.

362
00:20:10,933 --> 00:20:12,696
And we do dorky family
activities?

363
00:20:12,768 --> 00:20:16,499
Yes! Dorky sounds
really good right now.

364
00:20:16,572 --> 00:20:18,540
Well, girls, I'm sorry.

365
00:20:18,607 --> 00:20:20,700
I didn't realize
you felt this strongly.

366
00:20:20,776 --> 00:20:23,711
I promise, as soon
as we find the leopard,

367
00:20:23,779 --> 00:20:26,373
we'll do dorky
family activities.

368
00:20:26,515 --> 00:20:29,780
It's settled then.

369
00:20:31,921 --> 00:20:34,048
-You're leaving, too?
-Mm-hmm.

370
00:20:34,123 --> 00:20:35,590
Fine, go.

371
00:20:35,658 --> 00:20:37,751
I was just going to hang out
on the beach today anyway.

372
00:20:37,826 --> 00:20:39,851
Debbie, are you forgetting
that I talk to animals?

373
00:20:39,929 --> 00:20:41,794
Sadly, no. Your point?

374
00:20:41,864 --> 00:20:44,059
I'm going to find out where
that leopard is so we can leave,

375
00:20:44,133 --> 00:20:46,192
and maybe we'll
really take a vacation.

376
00:20:48,137 --> 00:20:49,365
Come on, Darwin.

377
00:20:52,875 --> 00:20:54,775
Darwin's staying here.

378
00:20:54,843 --> 00:20:55,775
See ya.

379
00:20:58,480 --> 00:20:59,538
Donnie!

380
00:20:59,615 --> 00:21:02,049
I did not slave
over a hot oven

381
00:21:02,117 --> 00:21:03,141
to feed the birds!

382
00:21:07,523 --> 00:21:09,855
When I write about my life--

383
00:21:09,925 --> 00:21:11,119
and I will--

384
00:21:11,193 --> 00:21:13,889
I will not be kind.

385
00:21:20,436 --> 00:21:22,199
Okeydoke, kids.

386
00:21:22,271 --> 00:21:25,035
You play here,
while the mommies and daddies

387
00:21:25,107 --> 00:21:28,565
try to ward off
the specter of doom.

388
00:21:37,119 --> 00:21:39,212
Babies, listen up.

389
00:21:39,288 --> 00:21:41,722
We're stucked
on a topical island

390
00:21:41,790 --> 00:21:44,054
that don't gots
no people on it.

391
00:21:44,126 --> 00:21:46,151
But we're here, Angelica.

392
00:21:46,228 --> 00:21:47,889
I mean people who matter.

393
00:21:47,963 --> 00:21:49,021
And we gots no food.

394
00:21:49,098 --> 00:21:50,224
And no cookies!

395
00:21:50,299 --> 00:21:51,960
You don't know what
you're talking about,

396
00:21:52,034 --> 00:21:53,228
Angelica.

397
00:21:53,302 --> 00:21:54,394
Oh, yeah?

398
00:21:54,470 --> 00:21:57,268
I saw a movie 'bout it once.

399
00:21:57,339 --> 00:21:59,068
These little kids
were all alone

400
00:21:59,141 --> 00:22:00,972
on an island till
they growed up

401
00:22:01,043 --> 00:22:03,034
and turned wild.

402
00:22:03,112 --> 00:22:05,012
The boy grew a beard
down to his feet,

403
00:22:05,080 --> 00:22:07,947
and they had to wear rags
for clothes.

404
00:22:09,018 --> 00:22:11,646
That's not the worstest part.

405
00:22:12,621 --> 00:22:13,553
This isn't like

406
00:22:13,622 --> 00:22:14,589
Our park back home

407
00:22:14,656 --> 00:22:17,216
With slides and pools
and swings

408
00:22:17,292 --> 00:22:18,350
It's a creepy little island

409
00:22:18,460 --> 00:22:20,724
With great big scary things

410
00:22:20,796 --> 00:22:23,196
Where mutant lobsters
crawl around

411
00:22:23,265 --> 00:22:25,096
Chomping on little kids

412
00:22:25,167 --> 00:22:27,192
And water wings can't save you

413
00:22:27,269 --> 00:22:29,237
From the slimy,
squishy squids

414
00:22:29,304 --> 00:22:30,601
That's why you need

415
00:22:30,672 --> 00:22:33,232
A princess--
someone beautiful, hmm?

416
00:22:33,308 --> 00:22:36,209
Like me-- to save you
from the scary claws

417
00:22:36,278 --> 00:22:38,246
That grab you from the tree

418
00:22:38,313 --> 00:22:40,042
So if you don't wanna
end up

419
00:22:40,115 --> 00:22:41,950
Being mutant lobster food

420
00:22:43,016 --> 00:22:44,584
The keep your Island Princess

420
00:22:44,784 --> 00:22:47,116
In a really happy mood

421
00:22:47,186 --> 00:22:49,746
That means
no blowing bubbles

422
00:22:49,856 --> 00:22:52,188
That means no making smells

423
00:22:52,258 --> 00:22:53,748
That means no bugging me

424
00:22:53,826 --> 00:22:56,420
To wear my royal shells, ha!

425
00:22:56,496 --> 00:22:14,728
Just do the things
I tell you

426
00:22:57,780 --> 00:22:58,780
Like bow when I walk by

426
00:23:00,148 --> 00:23:01,911
Listen when I speak to you

427
00:23:01,983 --> 00:23:04,315
But don't look me in the eye

428
00:23:04,385 --> 00:23:06,250
You're not
some lsland Princess

429
00:23:06,321 --> 00:23:08,516
There's not a squishy squid

430
00:23:08,590 --> 00:23:10,524
There are no mutant lobsters

431
00:23:10,592 --> 00:23:12,389
That would ever eat a kid

432
00:23:12,460 --> 00:23:14,519
Don't listen to her stories

433
00:23:14,596 --> 00:23:16,564
She always misbehaves

434
00:23:16,631 --> 00:23:18,599
She's trying to scare
you babies

435
00:23:18,666 --> 00:23:20,930
Into being lsland Slaves

436
00:23:21,002 --> 00:23:25,268
Why do you always have to be
so good and nice and cheeky?

437
00:23:25,340 --> 00:23:26,932
Just face the facts

438
00:23:27,041 --> 00:23:29,942
That I'm this
lsland Princess Angeli-tiki

439
00:23:30,011 --> 00:23:33,947
So if you don't wanna end up
being mutant lobster food

440
00:23:34,082 --> 00:23:35,947
Then keep
your lsland Princess

441
00:23:36,017 --> 00:23:37,951
In a really happy mood

442
00:23:38,019 --> 00:23:40,283
Keep your lsland Princess

443
00:23:40,355 --> 00:23:44,951
In a really happy mood.

444
00:23:45,026 --> 00:23:46,823
Y eah!

445
00:23:48,429 --> 00:23:49,487
It's obvious.

446
00:23:49,564 --> 00:23:50,895
The first thing to do

447
00:23:50,965 --> 00:23:52,626
is make a signal fire.

448
00:23:52,700 --> 00:23:54,463
You know what else
is obvious?

449
00:23:54,535 --> 00:23:55,502
You're an idiot.

450
00:23:55,570 --> 00:23:57,538
We have to find
something to eat.

451
00:23:57,605 --> 00:23:59,596
All I saved was a couple jars

452
00:23:59,674 --> 00:24:01,232
of baby food.

453
00:24:01,309 --> 00:24:03,334
I never knew
strained peas and apricots

454
00:24:03,411 --> 00:24:04,571
went so well together.

455
00:24:04,646 --> 00:24:06,273
Oh, you ate
the baby food?!

456
00:24:06,347 --> 00:24:07,541
Babies don't need food.

457
00:24:07,615 --> 00:24:09,173
I have to keep my strength up

458
00:24:09,250 --> 00:24:11,775
for when you try to throw
me into the soup pot!

459
00:24:11,853 --> 00:24:12,911
He's delusional.

460
00:24:12,987 --> 00:24:14,284
This is all your fault!

461
00:24:14,355 --> 00:24:15,287
My fault?

462
00:24:15,356 --> 00:24:17,688
Whose idea was the
Stu Cruise to Doom?

463
00:24:17,759 --> 00:24:18,691
Oh, I would expect that

464
00:24:18,760 --> 00:24:21,092
from the Finsters
or the DeVilles,

465
00:24:21,162 --> 00:24:22,094
but Charlotte!

466
00:24:22,163 --> 00:24:23,095
I knew
this day was coming

467
00:24:23,164 --> 00:24:23,926
since you were in diapers!

468
00:24:24,032 --> 00:24:25,556
I should have never left Paris!

469
00:24:40,014 --> 00:24:43,347
This is the Circle of Chaos.

470
00:24:43,418 --> 00:24:46,148
If we're going to survive
on this island,

471
00:24:46,220 --> 00:24:49,417
we can't ever step foot
in the Circle of Chaos.

472
00:24:50,925 --> 00:24:54,292
Wow. I feel
calmer already.

473
00:24:56,898 --> 00:24:59,389
We don't know when
we'll get off this island.

474
00:24:59,467 --> 00:25:01,662
Until we do,
we're gonna need order.

475
00:25:01,736 --> 00:25:03,397
First thing we need is a leader.

476
00:25:03,471 --> 00:25:04,802
Any volunteers?

477
00:25:06,307 --> 00:25:08,138
Stu, put down your hand.

478
00:25:09,911 --> 00:25:11,674
I nominate Betty.

479
00:25:11,746 --> 00:25:13,270
I accept.

480
00:25:13,348 --> 00:25:16,909
All in favor of me,
raise your hand.

481
00:25:16,984 --> 00:25:18,076
Hold on.

482
00:25:18,152 --> 00:25:19,779
You're all going
to blindly follow Betty

483
00:25:19,854 --> 00:25:21,651
just because
she drew a circle in the sand?

484
00:25:21,723 --> 00:25:22,712
Yes!

485
00:25:22,790 --> 00:25:23,916
Thank you.

486
00:25:23,991 --> 00:25:25,151
As my first duty

487
00:25:25,226 --> 00:25:26,318
as your rightfully

488
00:25:26,394 --> 00:25:29,693
elected leader,
I'm assigning Stu to baby watch.

489
00:25:29,764 --> 00:25:31,629
The rest of
yous, follow me.

490
00:25:33,201 --> 00:25:36,693
Geez, all I wanted to do
was have a little adventure.

491
00:25:36,771 --> 00:25:39,433
Now everyone and their brother
is blaming me for this mess.

492
00:25:42,744 --> 00:25:46,703
Angelica, are the growed-
ups mad at my daddy?

493
00:25:46,781 --> 00:25:48,715
That's a blunderstatement.

494
00:25:48,783 --> 00:25:50,580
He's in big trouble.

495
00:25:50,651 --> 00:25:53,643
It's cause of him we're going
to have to live here forever.

496
00:25:53,721 --> 00:25:55,120
Maybe we can help.

497
00:25:56,324 --> 00:25:58,815
You babies are
gonna help?

498
00:25:58,893 --> 00:26:01,259
You can't keep
your fingers

499
00:26:01,329 --> 00:26:04,196
out of your nose.

500
00:26:04,265 --> 00:26:05,391
We gots to try, Angelica.

501
00:26:08,002 --> 00:26:10,493
Guys, up that hill.

502
00:26:10,571 --> 00:26:12,300
I think it's the drainforest,

503
00:26:12,373 --> 00:26:16,036
just like we sawed
on Nigel Strawberry's TV show!

504
00:26:16,110 --> 00:26:19,011
Does that mean
Nigel Strawberry's here?

505
00:26:19,080 --> 00:26:22,072
What makes you think
that big-nosed nature guy's

506
00:26:22,150 --> 00:26:23,447
on this dinky island?

507
00:26:23,518 --> 00:26:26,214
Because that's the lastest place
we sawed him.

508
00:26:26,287 --> 00:26:28,084
He was getting eated
by a crocogator.

509
00:26:28,156 --> 00:26:29,384
'Member?

510
00:26:29,457 --> 00:26:30,788
Nice knowing you, Chuckie.

511
00:26:30,858 --> 00:26:32,189
Phil!

512
00:26:32,260 --> 00:26:36,253
I bet if we go in there,
we'll find Nigel Strawberry.

513
00:26:36,330 --> 00:26:38,355
He can help us get home!

514
00:26:38,433 --> 00:26:42,529
And no one would be mad
at your daddy no more!

515
00:26:42,603 --> 00:26:46,198
And I wouldn't have to share
the waffle I gots in my diapie.

516
00:26:46,274 --> 00:26:47,468
Philip.

517
00:26:47,542 --> 00:26:50,705
Uh, if I had a waffle
in my diapie.

518
00:26:57,051 --> 00:26:59,144
See you, Angelica.

519
00:26:59,220 --> 00:27:01,484
Hey, get back here.

520
00:27:01,556 --> 00:27:03,820
You babies better
listen to me,

521
00:27:03,891 --> 00:27:04,983
or else!

522
00:27:05,059 --> 00:27:07,459
Or else...

523
00:27:07,562 --> 00:27:08,995
I'm going to build a signal fire

524
00:27:09,063 --> 00:27:11,156
that will have us
off this island in no time.

525
00:27:11,232 --> 00:27:12,790
Uh, let's see.

526
00:27:12,867 --> 00:27:15,028
Gum, my special
"writes-upside-down" pen

527
00:27:15,102 --> 00:27:16,660
and disposable razor.

528
00:27:16,737 --> 00:27:19,535
Great. I can chew, shave,
and write about it.

529
00:27:19,607 --> 00:27:20,767
On my head.

530
00:27:20,842 --> 00:27:23,106
I can't believe it, Cynthia.

531
00:27:23,177 --> 00:27:26,237
Those babies always
do whatever I say!

532
00:27:26,314 --> 00:27:28,544
What's all this junk?

533
00:27:28,616 --> 00:27:29,810
It's not junk, Angelica.

534
00:27:29,884 --> 00:27:31,818
These everyday items can be used

535
00:27:31,886 --> 00:27:33,854
to make a lot of things.

536
00:27:33,921 --> 00:27:36,116
That's it!

537
00:27:36,190 --> 00:27:38,283
I'll build a radio
and send a distress signal!

538
00:27:38,359 --> 00:27:40,623
Angelica, keep an eye on
the babies for me, okay?

539
00:27:40,695 --> 00:27:44,256
I'm supposed to baby-sit
those half-pipes?

540
00:27:44,332 --> 00:27:46,391
That's dog's work!

541
00:27:47,568 --> 00:27:48,796
Spike! Wake up!

542
00:27:48,870 --> 00:27:49,928
Watch the babies.

543
00:27:50,037 --> 00:27:51,834
I got
important things to do,

544
00:27:51,906 --> 00:27:54,636
Iike find someone
to be my royal subjects.

545
00:27:54,709 --> 00:27:56,370
Now, go!

546
00:28:18,900 --> 00:28:22,631
Cynthia, this vacation stinks!

547
00:28:22,703 --> 00:28:23,897
I've been walking forever,

548
00:28:24,038 --> 00:28:27,007
and no one's come along
to carry me yet!

549
00:28:27,074 --> 00:28:29,907
Hey, that bird's got a cupcake!

550
00:28:29,977 --> 00:28:31,638
Drop it, beak-head!

551
00:28:33,314 --> 00:28:34,645
Ew!

552
00:28:45,393 --> 00:28:48,021
There's got to be someone
around here I can boss.

553
00:28:53,935 --> 00:28:55,266
Ew! Ah...!

554
00:28:55,336 --> 00:28:56,530
Listen up, monkey.

555
00:28:56,604 --> 00:28:59,232
All that chimp chatter
really bugs.

556
00:28:59,307 --> 00:29:03,004
Just hand over those munchies
and keep painting.

557
00:29:04,211 --> 00:29:06,577
Wow! She's got that monkey

558
00:29:06,647 --> 00:29:09,411
waiting on her hoof and mouth.

559
00:29:09,483 --> 00:29:12,748
Cynthia, I could learn
a lot from that girl.

560
00:29:12,820 --> 00:29:15,846
Excuse me, Miss Bossy Lady?

561
00:29:17,024 --> 00:29:18,582
Pipe down, monkey.

562
00:29:18,659 --> 00:29:20,058
Hey, lady!

563
00:29:20,127 --> 00:29:21,754
Who's calling me a lady?

564
00:29:21,829 --> 00:29:23,057
I'm a teen!

565
00:29:23,130 --> 00:29:24,358
Where did you
come from?

566
00:29:24,432 --> 00:29:26,662
This is supposed to be
a deserted island.

567
00:29:26,734 --> 00:29:29,396
I'm Angeli-tiki,
the island princess.

568
00:29:29,470 --> 00:29:30,801
And I'm thirsty.

569
00:29:33,274 --> 00:29:35,765
And I lost my touch
for being bossy,

570
00:29:35,843 --> 00:29:37,470
so you got to teach me.

571
00:29:37,545 --> 00:29:39,069
No ice cubes
next time.

572
00:29:50,391 --> 00:29:52,689
There's the drainforest, guys!

573
00:29:52,760 --> 00:29:55,354
Bet we'll find Nigel Strawberry
down there.

574
00:29:55,429 --> 00:29:57,294
Now you're talking, Tommy!

575
00:29:57,365 --> 00:29:59,265
Wait up! Wait for me!

576
00:30:05,373 --> 00:30:09,833
This place is different
than our own backyard

577
00:30:09,910 --> 00:30:13,402
I hope we haven't gone too far

578
00:30:13,481 --> 00:30:17,918
We're somewheres new
and we haven't a clue

579
00:30:17,985 --> 00:30:22,445
I just saw that butterflly
turn blue

580
00:30:22,523 --> 00:30:25,959
This is a strange
and mysterious place

581
00:30:26,093 --> 00:30:30,325
With lots of yummy buggies
for us to chase

582
00:30:30,398 --> 00:30:35,165
We're walking
and we don't know where

583
00:30:35,236 --> 00:30:39,263
Ooh-wee,
it's a jungle out here

584
00:30:39,340 --> 00:30:42,434
This place is really neat

585
00:30:42,510 --> 00:30:47,209
Lots of wormies for us to eat

586
00:30:47,281 --> 00:30:51,183
Lots of furry things
everywhere you stare

587
00:30:51,252 --> 00:30:54,847
Feels like I got some
in my underwear

588
00:30:54,922 --> 00:30:58,323
Monkeys swinging all around

589
00:30:58,392 --> 00:31:03,523
I wonder if we're ever going
to get found

590
00:31:03,597 --> 00:31:07,328
We're having lots of fun,
hey, look over there...

591
00:31:07,401 --> 00:31:12,100
Whoopie! Oh, boy! Yay!

592
00:31:12,173 --> 00:31:16,610
Great big snake
hanging from a tree

593
00:31:16,677 --> 00:31:20,169
I hopes that it
don't eat up me

594
00:31:20,247 --> 00:31:23,944
Fat green lizard
looking me in the eye

595
00:31:24,085 --> 00:31:28,579
I sure am glad
that I'm not that fly

596
00:31:28,656 --> 00:31:32,854
Prettiful birdies
singing a song, tweet tweet

597
00:31:32,927 --> 00:31:36,954
I hope we don't stay here
for long

598
00:31:37,031 --> 00:31:40,728
We gots a job to do,
and we're headed up there

599
00:31:40,801 --> 00:31:44,965
Look sharp,
it's a jungle out here

600
00:31:45,039 --> 00:31:49,476
We gots a job to do,
and we're headed up there

601
00:31:49,543 --> 00:31:53,912
Ooh-wee,
it's a jungle out here.

602
00:31:56,817 --> 00:32:00,480
Wow! It's got a gazillion feets.

603
00:32:00,554 --> 00:32:02,454
Well, down the hatch.

604
00:32:02,523 --> 00:32:04,616
Philip, no!

605
00:32:04,692 --> 00:32:05,716
Oh, sorry.

606
00:32:05,793 --> 00:32:07,090
Want a bite?

607
00:32:07,161 --> 00:32:10,062
No! I don't think
we should eat bugs

608
00:32:10,131 --> 00:32:11,462
no more.

609
00:32:11,532 --> 00:32:12,760
That's crazy talk, Lil.

610
00:32:12,833 --> 00:32:14,300
We've been raised on bugs.

611
00:32:14,368 --> 00:32:15,665
I know it, Philip,

612
00:32:15,736 --> 00:32:18,534
but that's afore I sawed
that poor fly

613
00:32:18,606 --> 00:32:21,734
get eated
by that big mean ol' flower.

614
00:32:21,809 --> 00:32:23,470
Now, you let him go!

615
00:32:31,085 --> 00:32:35,317
If I knowed the last bug I eated
would be the last bug I eated,

616
00:32:35,389 --> 00:32:40,088
I would've
eated it slower.

617
00:32:40,161 --> 00:32:41,719
Look! Growed-up feetprints!

618
00:32:41,796 --> 00:32:43,696
I bet
they're Nigel Strawberry's!

619
00:32:43,764 --> 00:32:45,425
Let's go!

620
00:32:47,535 --> 00:32:50,971
You know, it's lots easier going
potty in the drainforest

621
00:32:51,038 --> 00:32:52,198
than at home.

622
00:32:52,273 --> 00:32:53,968
And you don't have to worry

623
00:32:54,074 --> 00:32:57,669
'bout getting any on the floor
or the walls or anything.

624
00:32:57,745 --> 00:33:00,145
Guys? Uh...

625
00:33:00,214 --> 00:33:02,341
Wait up!

626
00:33:02,416 --> 00:33:04,611
Uh, uh, guys?

627
00:33:04,685 --> 00:33:08,052
Excuse me, I'm looking
for a clouded leopard.

628
00:33:08,122 --> 00:33:09,487
Have you seen any around?

629
00:33:09,557 --> 00:33:11,491
Sure. There's
one at the...

630
00:33:11,559 --> 00:33:13,823
Eliza!

631
00:33:18,365 --> 00:33:20,629
You'll never believe
what I just saw!

632
00:33:20,701 --> 00:33:24,262
There's a little girl at camp,
and she's a miniature Debbie!

633
00:33:24,338 --> 00:33:25,566
In every way.

634
00:33:25,639 --> 00:33:28,039
She's bossy, she's loud...

635
00:33:28,108 --> 00:33:30,474
she's hideous!

636
00:33:30,544 --> 00:33:32,171
Darwin, look!

637
00:33:32,246 --> 00:33:34,111
A dog?

638
00:33:34,181 --> 00:33:35,375
What's he doing here?

639
00:33:35,449 --> 00:33:38,282
Oh, spreading his fleas
on an unsuspecting world.

640
00:33:39,587 --> 00:33:41,555
Come on.

641
00:33:45,726 --> 00:33:47,489
Hey, hey, hey.

642
00:33:47,561 --> 00:33:49,961
Could you give a dog
a little warning?

643
00:33:50,097 --> 00:33:52,292
I'm trying
to do my business here.

644
00:33:52,366 --> 00:33:53,628
Oh, I'm so sorry.

645
00:33:53,701 --> 00:33:55,760
You know, it's funny.

646
00:33:55,836 --> 00:33:56,894
For a minute there

647
00:33:56,971 --> 00:33:59,303
I thought I actually heard you
talking to me.

648
00:33:59,373 --> 00:34:00,772
You talking to me?

649
00:34:00,841 --> 00:34:02,468
Are you talking to me?

650
00:34:02,543 --> 00:34:03,737
Yeah, I can talk
to animals.

651
00:34:03,811 --> 00:34:04,800
It's a long story.

652
00:34:04,879 --> 00:34:05,868
Should we come back?

653
00:34:05,946 --> 00:34:08,414
Ah, no problem; I'm done.

654
00:34:08,482 --> 00:34:10,074
I was just marking.

655
00:34:10,150 --> 00:34:12,311
Spike was here!

656
00:34:12,386 --> 00:34:16,345
Uh, sorry. I know...
Where are my manners?

657
00:34:16,423 --> 00:34:17,720
I am Spike.

658
00:34:17,791 --> 00:34:21,887
Full name: Down Spike! Down!
Get Off That Couch!

659
00:34:21,962 --> 00:34:23,156
I'm Eliza,

660
00:34:23,230 --> 00:34:24,663
and this is Darwin.

661
00:34:29,904 --> 00:34:33,203
Spike was here, too.

662
00:34:33,274 --> 00:34:35,208
Wow! I've been sneezing all day.

663
00:34:35,276 --> 00:34:36,868
My sniffer's on the blink.

664
00:34:36,944 --> 00:34:38,468
I can't even smell my own butt.

665
00:34:38,545 --> 00:34:39,534
And let me tell you,

666
00:34:39,613 --> 00:34:40,773
I've tried.

667
00:34:40,848 --> 00:34:42,042
Charmed.

668
00:34:42,116 --> 00:34:44,107
Spike,
what are you doing here?

669
00:34:44,184 --> 00:34:47,676
Well... I'm...

670
00:34:47,755 --> 00:34:50,053
To be honest with you,
I'm looking for my babies.

671
00:34:50,124 --> 00:34:51,284
You lost your babies?

672
00:34:51,358 --> 00:34:53,792
Probably too busy
drinking from the toilet.

673
00:34:53,861 --> 00:34:55,658
I was not! I
was sleeping.

674
00:34:55,729 --> 00:34:57,492
That was my
second guess.

675
00:34:57,564 --> 00:34:59,964
Hey, hey, smart boy,
you don't get it, okay?

676
00:35:00,100 --> 00:35:01,328
This is how it works.

677
00:35:01,402 --> 00:35:04,235
Usually they wander off,
I find them, no problem.

678
00:35:04,305 --> 00:35:06,170
But I can't smell.

679
00:35:06,240 --> 00:35:09,403
I might as well
not even call myself a dog.

680
00:35:09,476 --> 00:35:10,875
Don't worry,

681
00:35:10,945 --> 00:35:12,037
Spike.

682
00:35:12,112 --> 00:35:13,340
We'll help you find them.

683
00:35:13,414 --> 00:35:15,314
And I won't tell anyone
you lost them.

684
00:35:15,382 --> 00:35:17,907
Really? You really
will help me find them?

685
00:35:17,985 --> 00:35:21,352
Thank you!
That is so nice.

686
00:35:23,457 --> 00:35:26,551
Wow, you taste pretty good.

687
00:35:26,627 --> 00:35:27,992
Animals.

688
00:35:29,363 --> 00:35:32,924
Tommy? Phil? Lil?

689
00:35:33,000 --> 00:35:35,730
Spike?

690
00:35:47,214 --> 00:35:49,045
Aw...

691
00:35:49,116 --> 00:35:53,075
I knew we shoulda stayed
at the beach.

692
00:35:56,690 --> 00:35:59,523
This is the way
we wash our clothes

693
00:35:59,593 --> 00:36:01,493
Wash our clothes,
wash our clothes

694
00:36:01,562 --> 00:36:03,894
This is the way
we wash our clothes

695
00:36:03,998 --> 00:36:06,193
So early in the morning.

696
00:36:10,504 --> 00:36:12,597
Phil?

697
00:36:12,673 --> 00:36:13,833
Lillian!

698
00:36:13,907 --> 00:36:15,204
This is not funny!

699
00:36:38,232 --> 00:36:40,928
Oh, you're just my 'flection!

700
00:36:41,035 --> 00:36:42,730
How ya doin', Chuckie?

701
00:36:45,372 --> 00:36:47,397
Uh, my 'flection
never talked back!

702
00:36:47,474 --> 00:36:49,499
I been ascared
of lots of stuff 'afore,

703
00:36:49,576 --> 00:36:52,511
but I never been ascared
of me!

704
00:36:54,314 --> 00:36:55,645
Hey! Where'd it go?

705
00:36:55,716 --> 00:36:57,274
Um, Chuckie?

706
00:37:00,988 --> 00:37:02,421
That's not very nice.

707
00:37:02,489 --> 00:37:03,751
From now on,

708
00:37:03,824 --> 00:37:06,987
I'm not gonna make funny faces
with you no mores!

709
00:37:15,836 --> 00:37:17,895
Hey! Who's throwing stuff?

710
00:37:22,509 --> 00:37:25,569
My shorts feel kinda big...

711
00:37:25,646 --> 00:37:28,171
Aah! Who took my shoeses?

712
00:37:52,039 --> 00:37:52,937
Hey!

713
00:37:53,040 --> 00:37:56,567
My big-boy pants
aren't 'posed to do this!

714
00:37:59,046 --> 00:38:00,775
Oh!

715
00:38:00,848 --> 00:38:04,784
I don't even look
like Chuckie no mores.

716
00:38:27,841 --> 00:38:28,865
Phillip!

717
00:38:28,942 --> 00:38:31,172
No! We don't do that no mores!

718
00:38:31,245 --> 00:38:33,543
Aw, just one little wormie, Lil!

719
00:38:33,614 --> 00:38:36,913
Don't you 'member
how good they used to taste?

720
00:38:37,017 --> 00:38:39,383
How they tickled
on the way down?

721
00:38:39,453 --> 00:38:40,420
No, I don't!

722
00:38:40,487 --> 00:38:43,820
I told you I'm
a vegebelatarian now.

723
00:38:45,125 --> 00:38:47,992
We don't eat bugs.
We pet 'em.

724
00:38:49,129 --> 00:38:51,654
I don't knows you
anymore, Lil.

725
00:38:51,732 --> 00:38:52,926
Do you...

726
00:38:53,066 --> 00:38:55,091
do you still like
to eat mud?

727
00:38:55,169 --> 00:38:56,693
Not if it has a face.

728
00:38:56,770 --> 00:38:58,237
But you're my twin!

729
00:38:58,305 --> 00:39:00,478
Who's gonna 'splain
Mommy's jokes to me

730
00:39:01,022 --> 00:39:02,978
or-or help me plant my booger farm?

730
00:39:03,791 --> 00:39:06,692
And who's gonna tell me
when my feet smell?

731
00:39:14,368 --> 00:39:15,426
Okay, Dil.

732
00:39:15,502 --> 00:39:16,628
Do your stuff.

733
00:39:18,005 --> 00:38:33,271
Eeew! Tinky!

734
00:39:27,725 --> 00:39:30,751
Guys, I haven't seen Chuckie
for a long time.

735
00:39:30,828 --> 00:39:31,920
We better go back.

736
00:39:31,996 --> 00:39:34,931
You know how scared
Chuckie is of being losted.

737
00:39:34,999 --> 00:39:36,557
Chubby!

738
00:39:52,583 --> 00:39:54,642
Is everything okay, Chuckie?

739
00:39:59,023 --> 00:40:04,256
When did Chuckie
start talking backwards?

740
00:40:08,966 --> 00:40:10,092
Not a hair,

741
00:40:10,168 --> 00:40:12,159
not a paw print,

742
00:40:12,236 --> 00:40:13,726
not even a dropping!

743
00:40:13,805 --> 00:40:16,137
Must keep my chin up.

744
00:40:16,207 --> 00:40:17,401
I'll find that cat

745
00:40:17,475 --> 00:40:20,535
or my name's not
Nigel Archibald Thornberry.

746
00:40:20,611 --> 00:40:24,206
I'll find that big-nosed
nature guy,

747
00:40:24,282 --> 00:40:27,877
or my name's not Tommy
Awfully Bald Pickles!

748
00:40:30,621 --> 00:40:31,610
Donnie?

749
00:40:31,689 --> 00:40:33,020
Is that you?

750
00:40:38,262 --> 00:40:40,787
Look, it's Nigel Strawberry!

751
00:40:40,865 --> 00:40:42,457
We founded him!

752
00:40:42,533 --> 00:40:45,331
Great Goodall,
a gaggle of babies!

753
00:40:45,403 --> 00:40:46,995
Children!

754
00:40:47,071 --> 00:40:48,197
Stay right there!

755
00:40:48,272 --> 00:40:49,705
I'm coming down!

756
00:40:56,714 --> 00:40:59,410
Not the way I intended.

757
00:41:06,924 --> 00:41:09,358
Heavens, what a fall.

758
00:41:09,427 --> 00:41:12,590
I must get to those babies.

759
00:41:19,570 --> 00:41:22,767
Are you okay,
Mr. Strawberry?

760
00:41:22,840 --> 00:41:26,173
She called me "mister!"

761
00:41:26,244 --> 00:41:27,404
Silly Billy.

762
00:41:27,478 --> 00:41:30,470
I'm only this many years old!

763
00:41:30,548 --> 00:41:31,981
Do any of you remember

764
00:41:32,049 --> 00:41:33,949
where I left my tricycle?

765
00:41:36,621 --> 00:41:38,020
That's one old three-year-old.

766
00:41:38,156 --> 00:41:40,590
Uh, no, Mr. Strawberry.

767
00:41:40,658 --> 00:41:42,717
We're shipwrecked
on this island.

768
00:41:42,793 --> 00:41:45,591
We was hoping you could
help Tommy's daddy.

769
00:41:45,663 --> 00:41:49,099
Watch what I can do.

770
00:41:50,401 --> 00:41:51,390
Spinning?

771
00:41:51,469 --> 00:41:52,731
Tommy,

772
00:41:52,803 --> 00:41:57,035
I think Nigel Strawberry's
acting kinda funny.

773
00:41:57,141 --> 00:41:59,041
Maybe he's
got diapie rash.

774
00:41:59,110 --> 00:42:00,134
Oh, yeah!

775
00:42:00,211 --> 00:42:02,873
Wee! Wee!

776
00:42:07,919 --> 00:42:09,750
Did you catch
a whiff of anything yet?

777
00:42:09,820 --> 00:42:13,153
It's, look, it-it-it,
it's kind of a damp smell

778
00:42:13,224 --> 00:42:15,658
that's a cross between
sour milk and poop.

779
00:42:15,726 --> 00:42:16,658
Eww!

780
00:42:16,727 --> 00:42:17,989
Well,
actually I kind of like it.

781
00:42:18,095 --> 00:42:19,392
Sorry, Spike,

782
00:42:19,463 --> 00:42:22,091
but everything smells
pretty much the same to me.

783
00:42:22,166 --> 00:42:23,497
Ha! Humans.

784
00:42:23,568 --> 00:42:25,399
How do you live?

785
00:42:25,469 --> 00:42:28,233
And who put
the "poo" in pooch?

786
00:42:36,214 --> 00:42:37,545
Whoa.

787
00:42:37,615 --> 00:42:40,140
Okay, there you go.
Look at yourself now.

788
00:42:40,218 --> 00:42:42,209
All right, you got
a little dog pee on you.

789
00:42:42,286 --> 00:42:43,218
Oh, my gosh! You're the..

790
00:42:43,287 --> 00:42:45,448
I am Siri,
the clouded leopard.

791
00:42:45,523 --> 00:42:47,388
I'm Spike,
the purebred mutt!

792
00:42:47,458 --> 00:42:48,857
See these claws?

793
00:42:48,926 --> 00:42:49,893
Sniff my butt!

794
00:42:49,961 --> 00:42:50,950
Spike,

795
00:42:51,028 --> 00:42:52,256
why'd you say that?

796
00:42:52,330 --> 00:42:53,661
I was being social.

797
00:42:53,731 --> 00:42:56,598
Of course,
a simple handshake wouldn't do.

798
00:42:56,667 --> 00:43:01,764
Hey, twitchy, I do not
shake with cats, okay?

799
00:43:01,839 --> 00:43:04,967
Now... a small
chimp for breakfast,

800
00:43:05,076 --> 00:43:06,441
a mutt for lunch,

801
00:43:06,510 --> 00:43:08,978
and a sensible girl
for dinner.

802
00:43:09,046 --> 00:43:11,446
Hey, chimpboy,
will you stop worrying?

803
00:43:11,515 --> 00:43:13,574
I know all about cats

804
00:43:13,651 --> 00:43:15,312
with a capital K.

805
00:43:15,386 --> 00:43:17,911
Sit on a windowsill,
hack up a fur ball.

806
00:43:17,989 --> 00:43:21,425
Ooh,
that's very ferocious.

807
00:43:21,492 --> 00:43:23,790
Spike, this isn't
your regular house cat.

808
00:43:23,861 --> 00:43:25,453
They all twitch
their whiskers

809
00:43:25,529 --> 00:43:28,657
one whisker at a time,
just like you and me.

810
00:43:35,273 --> 00:43:37,104
Don't go and be fooled

811
00:43:37,174 --> 00:43:39,904
By those fancy pants

812
00:43:39,977 --> 00:43:44,175
It's just
her feline arrogance

813
00:43:44,248 --> 00:43:48,480
Flaunting their collars
with tinkly bells

814
00:43:48,552 --> 00:43:52,488
She thinks her litter box
don't smell

815
00:43:52,556 --> 00:43:54,023
Whoa, hey,
who cut the cheese?

816
00:43:54,158 --> 00:43:55,216
Was that you, baby?

817
00:43:55,293 --> 00:43:56,885
You may want
to reexamine your diet.

818
00:43:56,961 --> 00:43:59,657
Can the old
canine philosophies

819
00:44:01,198 --> 00:44:05,294
Why don't you just go
and tend to your fleas

820
00:44:05,369 --> 00:44:06,461
Don't push me, mutt

821
00:44:06,537 --> 00:44:09,973
I'm just not in the mood

822
00:44:10,107 --> 00:44:13,736
You're one swipe away
from becoming cat food

823
00:44:13,811 --> 00:44:18,578
Don't go and be fooled
by this crazy cat

824
00:44:18,649 --> 00:44:22,676
Don't go and listen
to his crazy facts

825
00:44:22,753 --> 00:44:26,780
Not gonna tell you twice,
you better watch your back

826
00:44:26,857 --> 00:44:29,291
Don't go and be fooled

827
00:44:29,360 --> 00:44:33,990
The big bad cat's
a fur-ball-hacking

828
00:44:34,065 --> 00:44:36,465
Rodent-snacking act

829
00:44:36,534 --> 00:44:38,365
That's right, an act.

830
00:44:39,603 --> 00:44:41,002
You're just a pussycat.

831
00:44:41,138 --> 00:44:42,435
You think you're tough?

832
00:44:42,506 --> 00:44:45,236
I dare you, Spike,
to call my bluff

833
00:44:45,309 --> 00:44:46,742
You're a very scawy puddytat.

834
00:44:46,811 --> 00:44:49,439
You're one swipe away
from becoming toast

835
00:44:49,513 --> 00:44:53,005
Eliza, get my doggy bag.
I'm about to catch a snack.

836
00:44:53,150 --> 00:44:55,550
We can settle this right now,
right here--

837
00:44:55,619 --> 00:44:58,281
mano a mano, dogo a cato.

838
00:44:58,356 --> 00:45:00,449
Ow!
That has gotta hurt--

839
00:45:00,524 --> 00:45:02,287
falling off a cliff
into a sticker bush.

840
00:45:02,360 --> 00:45:05,386
Not gonna tell you twice,
you better watch your back

841
00:45:05,463 --> 00:45:06,930
Oh! Here I am. Come get me.

842
00:45:08,532 --> 00:45:09,794
You think I'm afraid
of your claws?

843
00:45:09,867 --> 00:45:10,959
Coochie-coochie-coo.

844
00:45:11,035 --> 00:45:12,195
Bombs away, ladies.

845
00:45:14,205 --> 00:45:15,604
Come on, me and you.
Come on, let's go right now.

846
00:45:15,673 --> 00:45:17,573
I'll rip
that fur coat off ya

847
00:45:17,641 --> 00:45:19,074
and wear it,

848
00:45:19,143 --> 00:45:20,474
and all my dog friends
will be going,

849
00:45:20,544 --> 00:45:23,138
"Spike, where did you get
that skanky cat coat?"

850
00:45:28,352 --> 00:45:29,944
You hear what I'm saying, Red?

851
00:45:31,822 --> 00:45:33,847
I thought cats
didn't like water.

852
00:45:33,924 --> 00:45:35,152
But frankly, Eliza,

853
00:45:35,226 --> 00:45:36,921
she did need a bath...
Come on, come on.

854
00:45:36,994 --> 00:45:38,222
Oh! Whoa!

855
00:45:38,295 --> 00:45:39,660
Aw, what happened?

856
00:45:39,730 --> 00:45:40,662
Well,

857
00:45:40,731 --> 00:45:42,323
I'm outta here,
I gotta go find my babies.

858
00:45:42,400 --> 00:45:44,197
Helpless offspring?

859
00:45:44,268 --> 00:45:45,667
Yeah! Yeah!
That's it. That's it.

860
00:45:45,736 --> 00:45:47,761
Have you seen 'em?
Little ones, walk on two feet?

861
00:45:47,838 --> 00:45:49,703
Last time I saw 'em,
they were on the beach.

862
00:45:51,242 --> 00:45:52,174
Walking...

863
00:45:52,243 --> 00:45:53,642
stumbling, actually.

864
00:45:53,711 --> 00:45:54,973
Two feet?

865
00:45:55,045 --> 00:45:57,843
Yeah, they're
my human babies.

866
00:46:01,385 --> 00:46:02,852
I thought we were
looking for puppies!

867
00:46:02,920 --> 00:46:04,945
No, no. My pups
are home with the wife.

868
00:46:05,022 --> 00:46:06,319
She can't travel.

869
00:46:06,390 --> 00:46:07,322
Delicate stomach.

870
00:46:07,391 --> 00:46:08,824
Me, I could eat anything--

871
00:46:08,893 --> 00:46:10,827
shoes, furniture, pencils

872
00:46:10,895 --> 00:46:11,827
with the little erasers.

873
00:46:11,896 --> 00:46:13,386
I ate one of Chuckie's
diapers one time

874
00:46:13,464 --> 00:46:14,522
-Spike...
-and let me tell you...

875
00:46:14,598 --> 00:46:16,725
-Spike!
-that is spicy.

876
00:46:16,801 --> 00:46:19,736
Spike! We have to find those
babies before Siri does!

877
00:46:19,804 --> 00:46:20,862
Come on!

878
00:46:22,573 --> 00:46:25,303
When will I think
before I bark?

879
00:46:28,379 --> 00:46:31,143
Spike, is that you?

880
00:46:31,215 --> 00:46:33,183
Tommy? Kimi?

881
00:46:34,318 --> 00:46:36,149
Anybody?!

882
00:46:38,756 --> 00:46:40,951
Oh, no, not monkeys!

883
00:46:45,696 --> 00:46:49,154
Hey, they're chasing
that little one!

884
00:46:49,233 --> 00:46:51,724
That's not very nice.

885
00:47:02,613 --> 00:47:06,344
Now, you big monkeys
go 'way.

886
00:47:06,417 --> 00:47:09,113
You was little monkeys
yourselfs once...

887
00:47:09,186 --> 00:47:10,585
um... probably.

888
00:47:10,654 --> 00:47:15,614
So just go away and leave
this little monkey 'lone.

889
00:47:16,861 --> 00:47:18,795
Shoo! Shoo!

890
00:47:27,338 --> 00:47:29,067
Thanks.

891
00:47:31,175 --> 00:47:34,872
Wow! I saveded someone
'stead of someone saving me.

892
00:47:36,046 --> 00:47:39,948
I must be a wild boy now.

893
00:47:49,093 --> 00:47:51,220
Babies!

894
00:47:52,796 --> 00:47:54,229
Tommy!

895
00:47:54,298 --> 00:47:56,789
Susie!

896
00:47:56,867 --> 00:47:59,859
Oh, my dogness!

897
00:47:59,937 --> 00:48:02,497
What if I never feel
their sticky jammy fingers

898
00:48:02,573 --> 00:48:04,734
poking in my ears again?

899
00:48:04,808 --> 00:48:07,777
What if I never find a floating
diaper in my doggie bowl?

900
00:48:07,845 --> 00:48:08,777
What if...

901
00:48:08,846 --> 00:48:10,575
Spike! Snap out of it!

902
00:48:10,648 --> 00:48:12,479
Right, right, right, right.

903
00:48:12,550 --> 00:48:13,812
Not helping. Not helping.

904
00:48:13,884 --> 00:48:16,114
Focus, focus, Spike.

905
00:48:16,186 --> 00:48:17,676
What does "focus" mean?

906
00:48:17,755 --> 00:48:18,722
Right, right.

907
00:48:20,090 --> 00:48:22,456
But who's going
to sneak me donuts?

908
00:48:22,526 --> 00:48:24,494
Come on, we're almost there.

909
00:48:39,510 --> 00:48:40,977
These are much better

910
00:48:41,078 --> 00:48:43,444
than the cookies we gots
back at the grass hut,

911
00:48:43,514 --> 00:48:46,347
and I don't have to share
with no dumb babies.

912
00:48:46,417 --> 00:48:49,386
I mean, um,
dumb baby savages.

913
00:48:49,453 --> 00:48:51,000
Tell me about it.

914
00:48:52,161 --> 00:48:55,500
I have to share with a pigtailed weirdo,

914
00:48:54,329 --> 00:48:57,264
a jungle freak,
and a monkey in a tank top.

915
00:49:02,938 --> 00:49:04,000
Uh, refill.

916
00:49:04,925 --> 00:49:06,925
Why do I have to get it?

916
00:49:07,426 --> 00:49:08,859
You said you
wanted to learn

917
00:49:08,928 --> 00:49:10,088
how to be
bossy, right?

918
00:49:10,162 --> 00:49:11,686
This is how
you learn.

919
00:49:11,764 --> 00:49:14,528
Extra ice, two straws.

920
00:49:17,703 --> 00:49:20,866
I would trade the monkey
for her any day.

921
00:49:20,940 --> 00:49:23,306
Debbie, come in. Over.

922
00:49:23,375 --> 00:49:24,706
Hey, Mom, how's it going?

923
00:49:24,777 --> 00:49:26,244
It's not going at all.

924
00:49:26,312 --> 00:49:27,677
Have you heard from your father?

925
00:49:27,746 --> 00:49:30,010
No, but get this, Mom.

926
00:49:30,082 --> 00:49:32,573
Tell me later, honey.
Be back soon.

927
00:49:34,153 --> 00:49:36,314
Angeli-tiki is nobody's lackey.

928
00:49:41,794 --> 00:49:44,422
Hey, lady!

929
00:49:44,496 --> 00:49:46,123
What's that
bubble thing?

930
00:49:46,198 --> 00:49:47,358
A bathysphere.

931
00:49:47,433 --> 00:49:48,593
It goes underwater.

932
00:49:48,667 --> 00:49:50,134
You know,
like a submarine.

933
00:49:50,202 --> 00:49:52,033
Getting thirsty here!

934
00:49:52,171 --> 00:49:55,004
That girl's
even bossier than me.

935
00:50:05,017 --> 00:50:06,041
Those dumb babies

936
00:50:06,185 --> 00:50:08,050
are practically
on top of a mountain,

937
00:50:08,120 --> 00:50:10,054
and I'm gonna be blamed!

938
00:50:10,189 --> 00:50:12,054
I gotta go home
and pretend I'm innocent.

939
00:50:12,124 --> 00:50:14,718
Um, Debbie?

940
00:50:14,793 --> 00:50:16,055
I just 'membered.

941
00:50:16,128 --> 00:50:21,395
I was supposed to be home for,
uh, the lsland Sacrifice.

942
00:50:21,467 --> 00:50:23,867
Okay, my mom will drive you
when she gets here.

943
00:50:23,936 --> 00:50:25,164
But I have to go now.

944
00:50:25,237 --> 00:50:26,363
I'm the princess.

945
00:50:26,438 --> 00:50:28,531
Who do you think's
going to throw in the goat?

946
00:50:28,607 --> 00:50:31,075
Oh, it's a native thing.

947
00:50:31,210 --> 00:50:32,734
Oh, Mom will understand.

948
00:50:32,811 --> 00:50:35,439
But I am not waiting around
to watch the goat bite it.

949
00:50:39,518 --> 00:50:40,883
Is that a CD player?

950
00:50:40,953 --> 00:50:42,784
Yeah, only the best.

951
00:50:42,855 --> 00:50:46,552
You know an awful lot
for an "island girl."

952
00:50:46,625 --> 00:50:50,857
Um, well, see, a TV
washed up on the beach once

953
00:50:50,929 --> 00:50:54,797
and the island king
made the whole tribe watch it.

954
00:50:54,867 --> 00:50:56,266
Cool!

955
00:50:58,137 --> 00:50:59,069
I love this song!

956
00:50:59,138 --> 00:51:00,162
Hey, me, too.

957
00:51:07,913 --> 00:51:09,346
Woo!

958
00:51:12,017 --> 00:51:16,545
Darling you've got
to let me know

959
00:51:16,622 --> 00:51:18,817
Should I stay or should I go

960
00:51:20,826 --> 00:51:24,455
If you say that you are mine

961
00:51:24,530 --> 00:51:27,693
I'll be here
till the end of time

962
00:51:29,368 --> 00:51:33,498
So you've got to let me know

963
00:51:33,572 --> 00:51:36,234
Should I stay or should I go?

964
00:51:36,308 --> 00:51:37,900
Y ow!

965
00:51:37,976 --> 00:51:38,908
It's always tease...

966
00:51:38,977 --> 00:51:39,875
Whoa!

967
00:51:43,882 --> 00:51:44,314
Whoa!

968
00:51:48,821 --> 00:51:50,015
Debbie!

969
00:51:50,089 --> 00:51:52,023
Debbie, there's a bunch of
a babies lost around here,

970
00:51:52,091 --> 00:51:53,683
and the leopard's after them!

971
00:51:53,759 --> 00:51:55,818
I didn't know there was
a leopard out there.

972
00:51:55,894 --> 00:51:56,826
I'm gonna be

973
00:51:56,895 --> 00:51:58,089
in big trouble.

974
00:51:58,163 --> 00:52:00,154
Get back here and
put your seat belt on.

975
00:52:02,735 --> 00:52:04,669
C'mon, Cynthia.
We're taking a ride!

976
00:52:06,071 --> 00:52:07,436
Angeli-tiki!

977
00:52:09,274 --> 00:52:10,639
Oh, man.

978
00:52:22,554 --> 00:52:24,146
Twinkle, twinkle

979
00:52:24,223 --> 00:52:26,191
Little star...

980
00:52:45,377 --> 00:52:47,242
Debbie, what happened?

981
00:52:47,312 --> 00:52:50,509
I was taking care of this
island princess and...

982
00:52:52,317 --> 00:52:54,512
What's she doing
in the bathysphere?

983
00:52:54,586 --> 00:52:55,575
I didn't say

984
00:52:55,654 --> 00:52:58,248
I was taking care
of her well.

985
00:52:58,323 --> 00:53:00,883
Where are the lights
on this thing?

986
00:53:14,406 --> 00:53:16,033
I'm a kangaroo.

987
00:53:16,141 --> 00:53:18,336
Hoppity, hoppity, hop.

988
00:53:18,410 --> 00:53:19,741
I'm a froggie,

989
00:53:19,812 --> 00:53:21,074
and I'm frogging.

990
00:53:22,114 --> 00:53:25,447
All this hopping
is making my diapie creep.

991
00:53:25,517 --> 00:53:27,280
Ooh...

992
00:53:27,352 --> 00:53:29,786
Now I'm
a giant kitty cat,

993
00:53:29,855 --> 00:53:31,846
with lots

994
00:53:31,924 --> 00:53:33,289
of pointy toothies!

995
00:53:35,527 --> 00:53:36,653
Don't worry, guys.

996
00:53:36,728 --> 00:53:39,993
Nigel Strawberry plays with
wild aminals all the time.

997
00:53:40,065 --> 00:53:42,295
He'll get us
out of this scrape.

998
00:53:42,367 --> 00:53:43,766
Does kitty want a mousie?

999
00:53:43,836 --> 00:53:47,237
Does kitty want to dress up
in dolly clothes and take a ride

1000
00:53:47,306 --> 00:53:48,238
in Nanny's pram?

1001
00:53:50,943 --> 00:53:53,468
Kitty gave me a boo-boo.

1002
00:53:56,448 --> 00:53:58,439
Nice kitty.

1003
00:54:05,090 --> 00:54:06,455
Chuckie, be careful!

1004
00:54:06,525 --> 00:54:08,254
He's so brave.

1005
00:54:08,327 --> 00:54:09,760
Or dumb.

1006
00:54:28,714 --> 00:54:31,478
Hey, I been looking
all over for you.

1007
00:54:31,550 --> 00:54:34,041
I don't like being half nakie.

1008
00:54:34,152 --> 00:54:36,313
I want my clothses back.

1009
00:54:39,258 --> 00:54:41,283
Hey, I got sticks in my hair!

1010
00:54:41,360 --> 00:54:42,657
I gots no shoeses!

1011
00:54:42,728 --> 00:54:44,753
Oh, ouch, my feet!

1012
00:54:47,733 --> 00:54:48,665
That's better.

1013
00:54:48,734 --> 00:54:51,225
Now I can see.

1014
00:55:21,633 --> 00:55:22,759
Whoa!

1015
00:55:59,071 --> 00:56:01,562
Look, Mumsy, I'm a whale.

1016
00:56:03,642 --> 00:56:07,009
You sure he can
really help us, Tommy?

1017
00:56:07,145 --> 00:56:08,271
Of course, Susie.

1018
00:56:08,347 --> 00:56:10,975
He's Nigel Strawberry.

1019
00:56:11,049 --> 00:56:15,577
He's, um, the bestest
nature 'splorer ever.

1020
00:56:15,654 --> 00:56:19,818
Or... I thought he was.

1021
00:56:19,891 --> 00:56:22,553
Guess we're stucked here
till somebody finds us.

1022
00:56:22,628 --> 00:56:24,528
Who's going to find us in here?

1023
00:56:24,596 --> 00:56:25,995
I know what'll cheer

1024
00:56:26,064 --> 00:56:27,759
everybody up.

1025
00:56:27,833 --> 00:56:29,664
A nice waffle.

1026
00:56:29,735 --> 00:56:32,602
It's kind of crusty.

1027
00:56:32,671 --> 00:56:35,936
You sure you don't gots
any mable syrup in there?

1028
00:56:36,008 --> 00:56:38,738
Nope.
But I got some ketchup.

1029
00:56:38,810 --> 00:56:40,402
Watch this one.

1030
00:56:42,180 --> 00:56:42,908
What 'dat?

1031
00:56:42,981 --> 00:56:44,209
What 'dat?!

1032
00:56:46,018 --> 00:56:49,954
Maybe TV people are only
good at doing stuffs on TV.

1033
00:56:50,022 --> 00:56:53,958
Well, I guess we'll be living
on this island from now on.

1034
00:56:54,026 --> 00:56:55,323
That means...

1035
00:56:55,394 --> 00:56:59,524
I might not see my family
again for a long time.

1036
00:57:01,933 --> 00:57:03,992
Uh, you gonna eat
that waffle?

1037
00:57:04,136 --> 00:57:06,798
Shh, Phillip. Susie's sad.

1038
00:57:06,872 --> 00:57:08,362
I'm sad, too.

1039
00:57:08,440 --> 00:57:10,601
I want my mommy and daddy.

1040
00:57:10,676 --> 00:57:12,405
Me, too.

1041
00:57:14,613 --> 00:57:15,841
I'm sorry, guys.

1042
00:57:15,914 --> 00:57:18,007
I never shoulda
broughted you here.

1043
00:57:18,150 --> 00:57:19,913
Angelica was right.

1044
00:57:19,985 --> 00:57:25,685
I am just a backyard baby
with a diapie full of dreams.

1045
00:57:28,293 --> 00:57:30,352
No, you're not.

1046
00:57:30,429 --> 00:57:34,957
Tommy, you took us through
the drainforest all by yourself!

1047
00:57:35,033 --> 00:57:38,025
And led us up
the side of the mountain.

1048
00:57:38,170 --> 00:57:40,968
And you founded
Nigel Strawberry.

1049
00:57:41,039 --> 00:57:43,667
And you saved me from
the giant kitty cat.

1050
00:57:43,742 --> 00:57:45,505
Oh, you got lots more

1051
00:57:45,577 --> 00:57:47,909
than dreams
in your diapie, Tommy.

1052
00:57:50,549 --> 00:57:52,039
Thanks, guys.

1053
00:57:52,150 --> 00:57:55,517
That's the nicest stuff
anyone's ever said.

1054
00:57:55,587 --> 00:57:58,147
So, hey, even though
we're stucked in a cave

1055
00:57:58,223 --> 00:58:03,490
and there isn't any boat
and we can't swim,

1056
00:58:03,562 --> 00:58:06,793
I still promise
to get you out of here!

1057
00:58:08,500 --> 00:58:11,958
It's like my hero Nigel
Strawberry always says...

1058
00:58:12,037 --> 00:58:13,971
The Martians
have landed!

1059
00:58:14,039 --> 00:58:15,529
Um, no.

1060
00:58:15,607 --> 00:58:17,438
I was thinking
'bout when he says,

1061
00:58:17,509 --> 00:58:19,170
"Don't give up hope,

1062
00:58:19,244 --> 00:58:20,233
fateful viewers!"

1063
00:58:23,482 --> 00:58:25,177
Ahoy, babies!

1064
00:58:25,250 --> 00:58:28,708
Now who's your princess?

1065
00:58:28,787 --> 00:58:29,981
Yay! Let's go!

1066
00:58:30,055 --> 00:58:32,546
We're saved!

1067
00:58:34,860 --> 00:58:37,021
Drew, there's no longer
a ringing in my ears

1068
00:58:37,162 --> 00:58:40,029
from constant
cell-phone usage.

1069
00:58:40,098 --> 00:58:41,395
Oh, isn't this paradise?

1070
00:58:41,466 --> 00:58:42,865
Sure is, honey!

1071
00:58:42,934 --> 00:58:44,401
Whoa! Honey!

1072
00:58:44,469 --> 00:58:47,165
Didi, you think
this is done?

1073
00:58:47,239 --> 00:58:50,299
I've never cooked a fish
with its head still on.

1074
00:58:50,375 --> 00:58:51,842
Well, let me see.

1075
00:58:51,910 --> 00:58:52,968
Does it flake
when...

1076
00:58:54,446 --> 00:58:55,970
My fish!

1077
00:58:58,183 --> 00:58:59,775
Who's that
little cannibal boy?

1078
00:58:59,851 --> 00:59:01,113
Those look an awful lot

1079
00:59:01,186 --> 00:59:02,983
Iike Chuckie's
sneakers.

1080
00:59:03,121 --> 00:59:05,385
You ate the fish and Chuckie!

1081
00:59:05,457 --> 00:59:06,253
Come on, guys!

1082
00:59:06,324 --> 00:59:07,086
After him!

1083
00:59:11,763 --> 00:59:12,730
Whoa!

1084
00:59:12,798 --> 00:59:13,787
Hey, whoa-oh...

1085
00:59:13,865 --> 00:59:15,355
He's getting away!

1086
00:59:23,875 --> 00:59:27,174
Well, it's not a
clouded leopard,

1087
00:59:27,245 --> 00:59:28,803
but at least I'll have film
of something.

1088
00:59:29,915 --> 00:59:31,143
Donnie!

1089
00:59:34,186 --> 00:59:35,175
What?

1090
00:59:35,253 --> 00:59:37,585
This is supposed to be
a deserted island.

1091
00:59:37,656 --> 00:59:40,489
Oh, thank heavens!

1092
00:59:40,559 --> 00:59:42,754
We're part of an elaborate
television stunt

1093
00:59:42,828 --> 00:59:44,159
designed to humiliate us.

1094
00:59:44,229 --> 00:59:46,060
Who are you?

1095
00:59:48,300 --> 00:59:49,858
Hold it.

1096
00:59:49,935 --> 00:59:53,029
My name is Marianne Thornberry.

1097
00:59:53,104 --> 00:59:55,038
From the nature show?

1098
00:59:55,173 --> 00:59:56,197
We're shipwrecked.

1099
00:59:56,274 --> 00:59:57,434
Can you help us, Marianne?

1100
00:59:57,509 --> 00:59:58,874
Of course. Our
camp is nearby.

1101
00:59:58,944 --> 01:00:00,036
Debbie, come in.

1102
01:00:00,111 --> 01:00:02,272
Oh, Mom. What's up?

1103
01:00:02,347 --> 01:00:03,712
I need you to
bring the Comvee

1104
01:00:03,782 --> 01:00:05,215
over to the east beach.

1105
01:00:05,283 --> 01:00:07,217
Uh, that may be a problem.

1106
01:00:07,285 --> 01:00:08,809
Don't worry about
cleaning up.

1107
01:00:08,887 --> 01:00:11,355
Oh, thanks,
but that's not the problem.

1108
01:00:11,423 --> 01:00:12,890
Just get here. Now.

1109
01:00:12,958 --> 01:00:14,391
My daughter will bring
our trailer

1110
01:00:14,459 --> 01:00:16,188
and my husband
will be along soon and...

1111
01:00:16,261 --> 01:00:18,889
Behold, fellow islanders!

1112
01:00:18,964 --> 01:00:23,264
I, Stu Pickles,
have built us a radio!

1113
01:00:23,335 --> 01:00:25,633
Stu, who's watching the kids?

1114
01:00:25,704 --> 01:00:27,501
Oh, Angelica said she'd take
care of them.

1115
01:00:32,410 --> 01:00:34,037
Chuckie!

1116
01:00:34,112 --> 01:00:35,875
Oh, this is very strange.

1117
01:00:35,947 --> 01:00:37,847
I feel like this
has happened before.

1118
01:00:42,320 --> 01:00:43,412
Look at them...

1119
01:00:43,488 --> 01:00:45,080
chasing their own tails.

1120
01:00:45,223 --> 01:00:47,418
If only I could tell them
that it doesn't work.

1121
01:00:47,492 --> 01:00:48,754
I know, I've done it.

1122
01:00:48,827 --> 01:00:50,761
I've chased my tail
a million times.

1123
01:00:50,829 --> 01:00:52,922
It does not work.

1124
01:00:52,998 --> 01:00:55,262
It's getting a signal!

1125
01:00:55,333 --> 01:00:56,925
I'm very impressed.

1126
01:00:57,002 --> 01:00:58,492
Oh, Stu's an inventor.

1127
01:00:58,570 --> 01:01:00,731
Runs an ad in the shop-and-buy.

1128
01:01:02,140 --> 01:01:04,574
Girls, have you seen
some children?

1129
01:01:04,643 --> 01:01:05,701
Just a bossy 3-year-old

1130
01:01:05,777 --> 01:01:08,041
who has delusions
of being a princess.

1131
01:01:08,179 --> 01:01:09,771
-Angelica!
-I'm the boss

1132
01:01:09,848 --> 01:01:11,213
-of this bathie thing.
-That's her!

1133
01:01:11,283 --> 01:01:12,716
We haven't moved a bit,
Angelica.

1134
01:01:12,784 --> 01:01:13,808
That's Susie.

1135
01:01:13,885 --> 01:01:16,581
She must have turned on
the radio in the bathysphere.

1136
01:01:16,655 --> 01:01:19,055
A 3-year-old's driving
the bathysphere?!

1137
01:01:19,124 --> 01:01:20,182
What the heck?

1138
01:01:23,428 --> 01:01:25,589
Hey, it's no problem.

1139
01:01:25,664 --> 01:01:27,791
We can track them by
radar from the Comvee.

1140
01:01:27,866 --> 01:01:30,061
Uh... yeah. Except...

1141
01:01:30,135 --> 01:01:32,968
I sunk the Comvee.

1142
01:01:33,038 --> 01:01:34,164
You what?!

1143
01:01:38,810 --> 01:01:41,244
I'm beginning to think you
tooked this scrubmarine

1144
01:01:41,313 --> 01:01:42,746
without permission,
Angelica.

1145
01:01:42,814 --> 01:01:46,477
Oh, you think you're such
a know-it-all, Carmichael.

1146
01:01:46,551 --> 01:01:47,677
Now, here's the right button.

1147
01:01:49,120 --> 01:01:51,020
You need this to drive.

1148
01:01:51,089 --> 01:01:52,078
Mm-hmm.

1149
01:01:52,157 --> 01:01:53,647
Now, here's
the other right button.

1150
01:02:20,051 --> 01:02:21,712
Oh, I can't get a signal.

1151
01:02:21,786 --> 01:02:23,879
We've got to try to reach them
on your coconut.

1152
01:02:23,955 --> 01:02:25,752
Uh-uh, Carmichael.

1153
01:02:25,824 --> 01:02:27,223
Hello. Calling Angelica.

1154
01:02:27,292 --> 01:02:29,351
She really did give me
cream soda.

1155
01:02:29,427 --> 01:02:30,587
Angelica, Susie.
Can you hear me?

1156
01:02:30,662 --> 01:02:32,220
You didn't have permission,
Angelica!

1157
01:02:32,297 --> 01:02:33,355
Angelica!

1158
01:02:33,431 --> 01:02:36,229
Stop fighting this instant
and listen to your father!

1159
01:02:36,301 --> 01:02:37,233
...accessory!

1160
01:02:37,302 --> 01:02:39,827
Sorry, Mommy.

1161
01:02:39,904 --> 01:02:41,565
Our mommies and daddies!

1162
01:02:41,639 --> 01:02:43,231
Daddy, tell Susie
to stop bothering me

1163
01:02:43,308 --> 01:02:44,775
while I'm trying to drive
a scrubmarine!

1164
01:02:44,843 --> 01:02:46,572
Give me that, Angelica.

1165
01:02:54,519 --> 01:02:55,677
Hiya!

1166
01:03:02,235 --> 01:03:03,500
What's this?

1166
01:03:03,936 --> 01:03:05,665
A new toy?

1167
01:03:07,773 --> 01:03:10,105
Kippers!

1168
01:03:10,175 --> 01:03:11,570
I'm the happiest lad
in all of England!

1169
01:03:14,430 --> 01:03:16,430
Listen, Angeli-tiki.
It's me, Debbie.

1169
01:03:16,099 --> 01:03:17,000
Let me talk to my Dad.

1169
01:03:17,165 --> 01:03:18,097
Hey, mister!

1170
01:03:18,200 --> 01:03:20,498
Stop eating those smelly
fish and talk to the teen.

1171
01:03:20,569 --> 01:03:22,764
This little fishie
goes to market.

1172
01:03:22,838 --> 01:03:24,032
Yuk!

1173
01:03:24,106 --> 01:03:25,437
This little fishie stays home.

1174
01:03:25,507 --> 01:03:27,702
Great. Dad finally lost it.

1175
01:03:27,776 --> 01:03:28,868
Something's wrong with Nigel.

1176
01:03:28,944 --> 01:03:30,878
Girls, this is Mrs.Thornberry.

1177
01:03:30,946 --> 01:03:32,811
Do you see a red handle?

1178
01:03:32,881 --> 01:03:34,815
I see it!

1179
01:03:34,883 --> 01:03:36,043
I need you to push that up.

1180
01:03:36,118 --> 01:03:37,813
That will bring you
up to the surface.

1181
01:03:37,886 --> 01:03:39,478
Drooly,
don't touch that!

1182
01:03:56,571 --> 01:03:58,334
Oh, no, Nigel Strawberry!

1183
01:03:58,407 --> 01:04:01,001
This calls
for my 'mergency bottle.

1184
01:04:12,921 --> 01:04:15,082
Hello there.

1185
01:04:15,157 --> 01:04:17,853
Well, what have we here?

1186
01:04:17,926 --> 01:04:20,690
Who are all you positively
adorable children?

1187
01:04:20,762 --> 01:04:22,093
Huh?

1188
01:04:22,164 --> 01:04:23,597
We're shipwrecked.

1189
01:04:23,665 --> 01:04:26,361
We went all over the island
looking for you.

1190
01:04:26,435 --> 01:04:27,800
I saved them,
but then Carmichael

1191
01:04:27,869 --> 01:04:29,598
tried to drive this
tub-boat and now...

1192
01:04:29,671 --> 01:04:31,764
We just want to go home.

1193
01:04:31,840 --> 01:04:34,104
Well, of course
you do, young lady.

1194
01:04:34,176 --> 01:04:36,167
And so we shall.

1195
01:04:37,245 --> 01:04:39,110
Hmm. Bit of a pickle.

1196
01:04:39,181 --> 01:04:40,443
No fuel left.

1197
01:04:40,515 --> 01:04:42,449
The radar appears
to be knocked out,

1198
01:04:42,517 --> 01:04:44,451
which means I have
no idea where we are

1199
01:04:44,519 --> 01:04:47,113
and we're almost
out of oxygen.

1200
01:04:47,189 --> 01:04:48,281
I'm bored.

1201
01:04:48,356 --> 01:04:50,620
Yes, and there's that, too.

1202
01:04:50,692 --> 01:04:51,784
Angeli-tiki, come in!

1203
01:04:51,860 --> 01:04:52,792
What's going on down there?!

1204
01:04:52,861 --> 01:04:53,793
Deborah?

1205
01:04:53,862 --> 01:04:55,625
Is that you?

1206
01:04:55,697 --> 01:04:58,359
Dad! You're back to normal!

1207
01:04:58,433 --> 01:04:59,798
Well, Dad-normal anyway.

1208
01:04:59,868 --> 01:05:01,893
Oh, Nigel,
thank goodness you're all right.

1209
01:05:01,970 --> 01:05:03,301
Can you bring her
to the surface?

1210
01:05:03,371 --> 01:05:06,306
Impossible at the moment,
dearest.

1211
01:05:06,374 --> 01:05:07,636
You'll have to engage

1212
01:05:07,709 --> 01:05:09,904
the automatic-retrieval system
in the Comvee.

1213
01:05:09,978 --> 01:05:12,310
And I don't want
to alarm anyone,

1214
01:05:12,380 --> 01:05:14,245
but we're a tad low
on oxygen down here.

1215
01:05:14,316 --> 01:05:16,477
Copy that.

1216
01:05:16,551 --> 01:05:17,916
We'll get you as soon as we can.

1217
01:05:17,986 --> 01:05:19,010
Over and out.

1218
01:05:19,087 --> 01:05:21,647
Okay, we have to raise
the Comvee.

1219
01:05:39,674 --> 01:05:41,608
No go.

1220
01:05:41,676 --> 01:05:43,109
The pump's destroyed

1221
01:05:43,178 --> 01:05:45,908
and there's a huge
rip in the pontoon.

1222
01:05:47,015 --> 01:05:47,947
What, it's ripped?

1223
01:05:48,016 --> 01:05:49,108
Hang on.

1224
01:05:49,251 --> 01:05:51,981
The professor's getting
an idea.

1225
01:05:58,860 --> 01:06:03,229
How about a little song
to lift our spirits?

1226
01:06:05,400 --> 01:06:08,335
Old MacDonald had a farm

1227
01:06:08,403 --> 01:06:10,963
E-l-E-l-O

1228
01:06:11,039 --> 01:06:15,305
And on his farm
he had a ring-tailed lemur

1229
01:06:15,377 --> 01:06:17,868
E-l-E-l-O

1230
01:06:17,946 --> 01:06:19,573
With a guttural roar here

1231
01:06:19,648 --> 01:06:21,741
And a throaty rumble
there...

1232
01:06:21,816 --> 01:06:23,613
Okay, here's the plan.

1233
01:06:23,685 --> 01:06:26,586
We'll transfer force from
the bi-pedal energy generator.

1234
01:06:26,655 --> 01:06:29,089
to the dual reduction chamber.

1235
01:06:29,191 --> 01:06:31,785
The resulting compressed
atmospheric matrix

1236
01:06:31,860 --> 01:06:33,919
will transverse the tubular
transport mechanisms,

1237
01:06:33,995 --> 01:06:36,088
which you gentlemen will connect
to the deflated pontoon.

1238
01:06:36,231 --> 01:06:38,461
This will increase
the displacement coefficient

1239
01:06:38,533 --> 01:06:40,194
of the Comvee and it will rise

1240
01:06:40,268 --> 01:06:42,896
aided by a fulcrum-driven
counter balance

1241
01:06:42,971 --> 01:06:44,905
weighted with coconuts.

1242
01:06:44,973 --> 01:06:46,065
Let's do it!

1243
01:06:48,109 --> 01:06:49,269
It's perfect, but...

1244
01:06:49,344 --> 01:06:52,871
how are we going to inflate
a pontoon with a hole in it?

1245
01:06:52,948 --> 01:06:54,108
Oh, no.

1246
01:06:54,182 --> 01:06:55,206
What do we do now?

1247
01:06:55,283 --> 01:06:56,272
What's going on?

1248
01:06:56,351 --> 01:06:57,818
We can't raise
the Comvee.

1249
01:06:57,886 --> 01:06:59,615
We need something
to patch it.

1250
01:06:59,688 --> 01:07:00,950
Eliza!

1251
01:07:01,022 --> 01:07:02,387
There's a rafty thingy
out there.

1252
01:07:02,457 --> 01:07:03,549
Can we use that?

1253
01:07:03,625 --> 01:07:04,557
It's perfect!

1254
01:07:04,626 --> 01:07:05,888
She found your boat, Spike.

1255
01:07:05,961 --> 01:07:07,758
They can use it to
patch the Comvee.

1256
01:07:07,829 --> 01:07:08,761
I'll get it!

1257
01:07:08,830 --> 01:07:09,762
Spike, no!

1258
01:07:09,831 --> 01:07:10,855
The waves are too big!

1259
01:07:10,932 --> 01:07:14,834
Hey, this is Spike
you're talking to.

1260
01:07:14,903 --> 01:07:18,304
I've paddled my way to more
tennis balls than I can count!

1261
01:07:20,976 --> 01:07:23,501
If I could count.

1262
01:07:24,579 --> 01:07:26,012
But I'm afraid
you won't make it!

1263
01:07:26,081 --> 01:07:27,241
Sure I will!

1264
01:07:27,315 --> 01:07:30,409
And if I don't,
well, no one's going to say

1265
01:07:30,485 --> 01:07:34,148
that ol' Down Spike
didn't try his best.

1266
01:07:37,158 --> 01:07:40,559
You only go around once
in this crazy, mixed-up life.

1267
01:07:43,832 --> 01:07:45,094
Well, not cats.

1268
01:07:45,166 --> 01:07:46,428
They get nine lives

1269
01:07:46,501 --> 01:07:48,765
while dogs have to cram
seven years into one.

1270
01:07:48,837 --> 01:07:50,429
Now that bites!

1271
01:07:59,514 --> 01:08:02,039
That a boy, Spike.

1272
01:08:02,183 --> 01:08:04,014
Good boy, Spike.

1273
01:08:17,632 --> 01:08:19,532
Look! It's Spike!

1274
01:08:23,438 --> 01:08:24,735
Ooh, nice save, dog.

1275
01:08:24,806 --> 01:08:26,603
Good boy, Spike.

1276
01:08:29,244 --> 01:08:32,372
But what are we going
to use for glue?

1277
01:08:33,815 --> 01:08:35,043
I'll take care of it.

1278
01:08:38,320 --> 01:08:40,254
That gum won't stay
sticky for long.

1279
01:08:40,322 --> 01:08:42,586
-Places!
-Let's go.

1280
01:08:43,658 --> 01:08:44,625
Debbie?

1281
01:08:45,694 --> 01:08:46,752
Don't worry, Mom.

1282
01:08:46,828 --> 01:08:48,159
I'm on it.

1283
01:09:05,447 --> 01:09:06,971
Got it!

1284
01:09:07,048 --> 01:09:08,140
Pedal!

1285
01:09:25,633 --> 01:09:27,260
It's working!

1286
01:09:43,551 --> 01:09:45,485
And on his farm

1287
01:09:45,553 --> 01:09:50,013
He had a oceanospirillum
multiglouliferum

1288
01:09:50,091 --> 01:09:53,026
E-l-E-l-O.

1289
01:09:57,365 --> 01:10:00,926
Can we go home now,
Mr. Strawberry?

1290
01:10:20,522 --> 01:10:22,012
We've got 'em!

1291
01:10:22,090 --> 01:10:23,648
Now let's reel 'em in.

1292
01:10:27,529 --> 01:10:28,757
Nigel,

1293
01:10:28,830 --> 01:10:30,457
is everybody okay down there?

1294
01:10:30,532 --> 01:10:32,124
Excellent, dearest.

1295
01:10:32,233 --> 01:10:34,428
Well, one little girl is
rather pouty

1296
01:10:34,502 --> 01:10:38,495
and somebody needs a diaper
change-- I won't say whom.

1297
01:10:42,577 --> 01:10:44,545
Smashing!

1298
01:10:44,612 --> 01:10:46,944
Why, it's the architeuthis,

1299
01:10:47,015 --> 01:10:49,575
commonly known
as the giant squid.

1300
01:10:54,222 --> 01:10:57,282
Isn't she magnificent?

1301
01:10:57,358 --> 01:11:00,156
If only I had a camera...

1302
01:11:00,261 --> 01:11:02,752
Here,
Mr. Strawberry...

1303
01:11:02,831 --> 01:11:04,093
60 feet long

1304
01:11:04,165 --> 01:11:06,793
and two tons of boneless flesh.

1305
01:11:11,773 --> 01:11:13,104
Oh, your picture

1306
01:11:13,174 --> 01:11:15,108
didn't come out.

1307
01:11:15,176 --> 01:11:17,906
Well, that's probably
as it should be.

1308
01:11:17,979 --> 01:11:20,243
You see, children,
the giant squid

1309
01:11:20,315 --> 01:11:23,113
has never been seen alive
before.

1310
01:11:23,218 --> 01:11:27,985
I suppose this marvel of nature
will be our little secret.

1311
01:11:28,056 --> 01:11:29,717
What do you say?

1312
01:11:33,561 --> 01:11:35,461
Couldn't have said it
better myself.

1313
01:11:51,179 --> 01:11:52,578
Here I am!

1314
01:11:56,651 --> 01:11:59,586
-Mommy!
-Daddy!

1315
01:12:00,989 --> 01:12:02,479
Dil!

1316
01:12:02,557 --> 01:12:03,683
Susie!

1317
01:12:03,758 --> 01:12:05,157
Where's Tommy?

1318
01:12:06,427 --> 01:12:08,895
And who does this little chap
belong to?

1319
01:12:11,299 --> 01:12:12,664
He's ours.

1320
01:12:23,778 --> 01:12:25,678
Come here, champ.

1321
01:12:26,714 --> 01:12:27,942
Honey,

1322
01:12:28,016 --> 01:12:30,211
I'd like you
to meet Stu Pickles.

1323
01:12:30,285 --> 01:12:33,948
He made the coconut radio
that saved your lives.

1324
01:12:34,022 --> 01:12:35,512
Terribly grateful,
Mr. Pickles.

1325
01:12:37,559 --> 01:12:39,720
I have a feeling
I wouldn't be here

1326
01:12:39,794 --> 01:12:41,125
without this
little chap, either.

1327
01:12:47,602 --> 01:12:48,626
Pickles!

1328
01:12:49,938 --> 01:12:52,133
You might grow up

1329
01:12:52,240 --> 01:12:55,334
to be just like
Nigel Strawberry after all.

1330
01:12:55,410 --> 01:12:57,037
Thanks, Angelica.

1331
01:12:57,111 --> 01:13:01,480
But I think I'll grow up
to be just like my daddy.

1332
01:13:01,549 --> 01:13:03,278
Well, bro, I got
to hand it to you...

1333
01:13:03,351 --> 01:13:04,613
I'm so proud of you, Stu.

1334
01:13:04,686 --> 01:13:07,849
Oh, Nigel,
I was so worried.

1335
01:13:07,922 --> 01:13:10,083
I confess, I was, too.

1336
01:13:10,224 --> 01:13:12,886
I hated the thought
of our last family meal

1337
01:13:12,961 --> 01:13:16,795
being shortchanged because
we had to go find a leopard.

1338
01:13:18,433 --> 01:13:20,298
Your father's right.

1339
01:13:20,368 --> 01:13:22,700
We lost sight
of what's important--

1340
01:13:22,770 --> 01:13:24,533
spending time together.

1341
01:13:28,610 --> 01:13:29,770
Okay, everyone.

1342
01:13:29,844 --> 01:13:31,539
Let's pack up.

1343
01:13:31,613 --> 01:13:32,875
We're going on vacation!

1344
01:13:34,849 --> 01:13:36,510
How about...

1345
01:13:36,584 --> 01:13:38,745
The Lipschitz Cruise!

1346
01:13:38,820 --> 01:13:40,788
We're leaving to go on vacation.

1347
01:13:40,855 --> 01:13:42,413
Oh, yeah, right on.

1348
01:13:43,791 --> 01:13:45,554
Ya-hoo!

1349
01:14:06,247 --> 01:14:10,047
Well, Eliza,
as dog is my witness,

1350
01:14:10,118 --> 01:14:13,349
I'll never lose my babies again!
