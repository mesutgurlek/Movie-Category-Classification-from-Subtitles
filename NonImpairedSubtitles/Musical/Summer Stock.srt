1
00:01:53,829 --> 00:02:01,032
If you feel like singing,
sing Tra la la your cares away

2
00:02:01,238 --> 00:02:05,174
There's something about
Giving out with a song

3
00:02:05,342 --> 00:02:06,639
Makes you belong

4
00:02:06,843 --> 00:02:11,747
Helps you to find A
peace of mindful day

5
00:02:11,950 --> 00:02:15,613
If you feel like humming, hum

6
00:02:15,820 --> 00:02:19,119
Fiddle
dee-dee-da-dee dum

7
00:02:19,324 --> 00:02:23,454
Supposing you do-re-mi
slightly off key

8
00:02:23,628 --> 00:02:26,097
Everyone can't be a Bing

9
00:02:26,298 --> 00:02:29,790
Tell your friends to go places
If they start making faces

10
00:02:29,969 --> 00:02:33,770
If you feel like singing, sing

11
00:02:42,716 --> 00:02:46,709
There's something about
Giving out with a song

12
00:02:46,886 --> 00:02:48,354
Makes you belong

13
00:02:48,589 --> 00:02:53,218
Helps you to find A
peace of mindful day

14
00:03:00,868 --> 00:03:04,430
Just look in the mirror And do a duet

15
00:03:04,606 --> 00:03:07,699
And raise your voices aloft

16
00:03:07,908 --> 00:03:11,709
Don't move out of your dwelling
If your neighbors start yelling

17
00:03:11,880 --> 00:03:15,111
If you can't sing good Sing soft

18
00:03:19,155 --> 00:03:22,681
When your luck is in need of repair

19
00:03:24,827 --> 00:03:26,226
Don't you care

20
00:03:26,429 --> 00:03:30,423
Anyone who feels chipper Will
chirp out like a whippoorwill

21
00:03:30,668 --> 00:03:33,762
It mustrt necessarily
be any anniversary

22
00:03:33,937 --> 00:03:36,997
Or be an extra-special event

23
00:03:37,207 --> 00:03:40,005
If you feel like singing, sing

24
00:03:40,177 --> 00:03:43,237
Tra-la-la fiddle
dee tra-la-la

25
00:03:43,447 --> 00:03:49,148
Sing to your heart's content

26
00:03:54,360 --> 00:04:01,664
If you feel like singing, sing

27
00:04:09,776 --> 00:04:11,766
- Good morning, Es.
- Never mind the bed now.

28
00:04:11,977 --> 00:04:15,243
Frank and Zeb are waiting to
see you. In their Sunday clothes.

29
00:04:15,449 --> 00:04:18,043
- Sunday clothes?
- Hats and all.

30
00:04:18,251 --> 00:04:20,048
- What for?
- Well, you can't put it on me.

31
00:04:20,220 --> 00:04:21,688
You know them. Never tell me nothing.

32
00:04:21,956 --> 00:04:24,117
Just stand around acting mysterious.

33
00:04:25,460 --> 00:04:27,792
Good morning, Zeb, Frank.

34
00:04:28,463 --> 00:04:31,557
- It's a beautiful day, isn't it?
- Yep.

35
00:04:32,967 --> 00:04:36,563
- Are you going someplace?
- Yep.

36
00:04:37,206 --> 00:04:43,008
You see, we figured, that is my brother
and me, now that the planting's done...

37
00:04:43,245 --> 00:04:47,113
...we were going to run along down to
Hartford way and get us a job in a factory.

38
00:04:47,449 --> 00:04:51,284
- You're quitting without giving a notice?
- Wait a minute. Wait a minute.

39
00:04:51,488 --> 00:04:54,924
Why, you two worked
this farm for my father.

40
00:04:55,091 --> 00:04:57,458
And for his father before him.

41
00:04:57,661 --> 00:04:59,150
You know how much I need you.

42
00:04:59,462 --> 00:05:03,262
Your grandpa paid us and your
pa too. But you ain't, Miss Jane.

43
00:05:03,934 --> 00:05:08,132
I know, but how could I? We haven't
had a decent crop for three years.

44
00:05:08,339 --> 00:05:10,534
You can't say you ain't
been eating good, can you?

45
00:05:10,776 --> 00:05:15,508
No, but Zeb won't be able to eat
at all unless he gets his new teeth.

46
00:05:15,780 --> 00:05:17,772
Takes money.

47
00:05:19,317 --> 00:05:23,276
We're gonna have a fine crop this
year. Everything points to it.

48
00:05:23,488 --> 00:05:25,548
And I'll make it up
to you. You know that.

49
00:05:31,196 --> 00:05:32,425
I've got to have my teeth.

50
00:05:35,635 --> 00:05:38,468
We don't doubt your
intentions, Miss Jane.

51
00:05:38,671 --> 00:05:40,867
But we made up our mind.

52
00:05:41,074 --> 00:05:44,908
- We're set on it. Bye.
- Wait a minute.

53
00:05:45,479 --> 00:05:46,913
Wait. Just a minute.

54
00:05:56,491 --> 00:05:58,391
It's car fare, anyway.

55
00:05:58,593 --> 00:06:02,155
Watch Bessie careful-like.
She ought to calve pretty soon.

56
00:06:02,364 --> 00:06:04,422
Hope it's a heifer.

57
00:06:06,901 --> 00:06:09,496
Don't slam the door.

58
00:06:16,246 --> 00:06:18,214
Traitors!

59
00:06:18,415 --> 00:06:21,508
I been expecting something
like this for a long time.

60
00:06:21,717 --> 00:06:24,414
Each got one shifty eye, them two.

61
00:06:24,621 --> 00:06:28,557
- Ever notice?
- Oh, I don't blame them.

62
00:06:28,758 --> 00:06:30,886
I wouldn't blame you if you left too.

63
00:06:31,095 --> 00:06:33,689
Me? Where'd I'd leave to?

64
00:06:33,898 --> 00:06:36,092
If we're gonna be two
women alone on this farm...

65
00:06:36,266 --> 00:06:38,735
...we better get that old
shotgun ready for snoopers.

66
00:06:38,936 --> 00:06:41,029
Next time to town, get
some blanks, will you?

67
00:06:41,239 --> 00:06:43,104
Blanks? Why blanks?

68
00:06:43,341 --> 00:06:47,335
If any mars gonna snoop around me, I
don't want to kill him. Just stun him.

69
00:06:47,546 --> 00:06:50,208
Oh, Es, what would I do without you?

70
00:06:50,415 --> 00:06:54,146
Anyway, we're not just two women alone.
Abigail will be here this afternoon.

71
00:06:54,386 --> 00:06:56,354
How long will she stay this time?

72
00:06:56,555 --> 00:06:59,389
That sister of yours is the
reason this farm's in trouble.

73
00:06:59,592 --> 00:07:02,117
Bringing money out for
college and not finishing.

74
00:07:02,362 --> 00:07:05,662
- Then painting lessons and drawing lessons.
- I know.

75
00:07:05,900 --> 00:07:07,958
Abby had to have her
chance though, Es.

76
00:07:08,167 --> 00:07:11,261
You wait and see. When she finds
we're in trouble, she'll pitch in.

77
00:07:11,471 --> 00:07:14,532
How about field work and heavy
work? Women can't do that.

78
00:07:15,075 --> 00:07:17,805
Get a jar of that new
marmalade, will you?

79
00:07:18,979 --> 00:07:21,778
I want to see how it compares
with what I made last year.

80
00:07:22,684 --> 00:07:26,814
Yes, they can. We could do the
heavy work if we had a tractor.

81
00:07:27,022 --> 00:07:29,616
- A tractor?
- I'm going into Wingait Falls.

82
00:07:29,791 --> 00:07:32,385
If Abigail comes while I'm out
don't tell her anything yet.

83
00:07:32,561 --> 00:07:36,089
A tractor? It seems to
me tractors cost money!

84
00:07:42,538 --> 00:07:44,438
Hi, Orv.

85
00:07:44,640 --> 00:07:46,767
You're here awfully
early. Good morning, Jane.

86
00:07:47,677 --> 00:07:50,670
Good morning. Oh,
aren't you feeling well?

87
00:07:50,847 --> 00:07:53,008
It's my allergy again.
It's that new clover seed.

88
00:07:53,183 --> 00:07:55,414
- It's attacking my sinuses.
- Oh, I'm sorry.

89
00:07:55,620 --> 00:07:58,110
Getting the barn ready
for tomorrow night?

90
00:07:58,322 --> 00:08:02,419
Well, I haven't had time to
put any decorations up yet.

91
00:08:02,627 --> 00:08:06,688
I was gonna come over tonight and
help you blow up the balloons, but...

92
00:08:07,031 --> 00:08:09,363
- I don't think I better.
- I don't think you better.

93
00:08:10,369 --> 00:08:13,303
You got anything special
on your mind, Jane?

94
00:08:14,072 --> 00:08:16,233
Yeah. I need a few things.

95
00:08:16,474 --> 00:08:19,239
I'll get my order blanks.
They're right over here.

96
00:08:23,515 --> 00:08:27,452
- Some baling wire.
- Baling wire?

97
00:08:27,654 --> 00:08:29,086
And...

98
00:08:29,755 --> 00:08:34,352
...I need some of that
clover seed. I'm sorry...

99
00:08:35,895 --> 00:08:37,385
Clover seed.

100
00:08:37,597 --> 00:08:39,725
And some paint. Red paint.

101
00:08:39,967 --> 00:08:41,901
- Gallon?
- Yeah.

102
00:08:42,103 --> 00:08:45,037
A bucket of paint.

103
00:08:45,506 --> 00:08:49,738
And some thumbtacks.

104
00:08:49,977 --> 00:08:52,241
Thumbtacks.

105
00:08:53,415 --> 00:08:55,542
And a tractor.

106
00:08:55,751 --> 00:08:57,412
And a tract...

107
00:08:58,787 --> 00:09:02,382
Zeb and Frank quit this morning. And
I'll never get the crops in by myself.

108
00:09:02,591 --> 00:09:05,082
- But if I had a tractor...
- Do you know what it costs?

109
00:09:05,761 --> 00:09:09,493
I know, but I could have everything
paid off by harvest time. Look.

110
00:09:09,699 --> 00:09:11,189
This is the kind I want.

111
00:09:11,401 --> 00:09:13,927
- They're very expensive.
- But, Orv, it's so important.

112
00:09:14,104 --> 00:09:17,732
I'd better speak to Dad
about this. He'd... He'd...

113
00:09:17,974 --> 00:09:19,407
All right.

114
00:09:22,513 --> 00:09:25,607
Not that there'd be any trouble,
you understand. It's just that...

115
00:09:25,816 --> 00:09:28,046
You wait...

116
00:09:30,555 --> 00:09:32,647
Yeah, what do you want?

117
00:09:33,824 --> 00:09:36,259
- Speak up.
- It's Jane.

118
00:09:36,428 --> 00:09:39,989
What does she want?
What does she want? What?

119
00:09:40,165 --> 00:09:41,655
A tractor?!

120
00:09:42,400 --> 00:09:45,165
- She's outside.
- Why didn't you tell me? Go on, let her in.

121
00:09:45,404 --> 00:09:48,396
All right, Dad. Jane.

122
00:09:50,976 --> 00:09:53,069
- Good morning, Jane.
- Good morning.

123
00:09:53,245 --> 00:09:55,839
- Come in. Sit down.
- Thank you.

124
00:09:56,082 --> 00:09:59,849
- I suppose Orville has told you about...
- Oh, yes, yes, yes.

125
00:10:00,087 --> 00:10:03,818
- Zeb and Frank quit this morning...
- I'm going to talk to you just like a father.

126
00:10:04,058 --> 00:10:07,254
I'll be your father someday.

127
00:10:07,761 --> 00:10:10,855
Now, Jane, running a
farm isn't womars work.

128
00:10:11,098 --> 00:10:14,068
Why don't you put the
burden where it belongs?

129
00:10:14,569 --> 00:10:16,867
- But Mr...
- I know how you feel about your farm.

130
00:10:17,071 --> 00:10:20,872
Why shouldn't I? Why, my forefathers
got the second land grant in this area.

131
00:10:21,075 --> 00:10:23,202
Just one year after your people.

132
00:10:23,444 --> 00:10:26,937
Why, our folks built this part of
the country with their bare hands.

133
00:10:27,149 --> 00:10:31,347
That's why I've always dreamed of you
and Orville. The Falburys, the Wingaits.

134
00:10:31,587 --> 00:10:33,078
Carrying on our heritage.

135
00:10:33,289 --> 00:10:35,951
- I understand...
- You know how Orville feels about you.

136
00:10:36,159 --> 00:10:39,389
Why, he's been in love with you
ever since you both were that high.

137
00:10:39,628 --> 00:10:42,154
And each year he's loved you more.

138
00:10:42,365 --> 00:10:44,356
Havert you, Orv?

139
00:10:44,601 --> 00:10:48,834
- I said you love Jane.
- She knows that, Dad.

140
00:10:49,306 --> 00:10:52,207
Mr. Wingait, Orville and I
can't get married just yet.

141
00:10:52,409 --> 00:10:56,175
I mean, how would it look?
I owe the store so much.

142
00:10:56,380 --> 00:10:58,746
The debt's cleared off the
books. A wedding present.

143
00:10:58,983 --> 00:11:01,680
Oh, no, Mr. Wingait.
I can't accept that.

144
00:11:01,887 --> 00:11:04,651
I mean, I think you're
terribly kind, but...

145
00:11:04,890 --> 00:11:06,152
But no.

146
00:11:06,358 --> 00:11:11,523
No, Orv and I will just have to wait
until I work my farm free of debt.

147
00:11:11,696 --> 00:11:16,396
Yup, you're a Falbury, all right.
When would you like that tractor?

148
00:11:17,236 --> 00:11:21,195
Oh, Mr. Wingait. Could
I get it right away?

149
00:11:21,374 --> 00:11:25,334
- Go on and pick it out.
- Oh, well, thank you so much.

150
00:11:25,545 --> 00:11:28,173
That's wonderful. Can you
drive the truck back tomorrow?

151
00:11:28,347 --> 00:11:30,441
- Sure, Jane.
- All right. Goodbye.

152
00:11:30,684 --> 00:11:33,448
- Goodbye, Mr. Wingait.
- Goodbye. See you at the dance.

153
00:11:35,589 --> 00:11:37,148
Well, go on. Help her.

154
00:11:37,358 --> 00:11:39,792
All right. Don't I ever
do anything right here?

155
00:11:39,961 --> 00:11:41,587
No.

156
00:11:42,796 --> 00:11:44,765
- Nose drops.
- Nose drops.

157
00:11:47,235 --> 00:11:49,760
- Howdy, neighbor
- Howdy, neighbor

158
00:11:49,938 --> 00:11:52,066
Happy harvest

159
00:11:52,241 --> 00:11:56,974
May your 40 acres Soon
be fields of clover

160
00:11:57,213 --> 00:11:59,181
Yes, indeed, and plant a wish

161
00:11:59,348 --> 00:12:02,112
With every seed and by and by

162
00:12:02,318 --> 00:12:04,843
The sun and rain will make an etching

163
00:12:05,020 --> 00:12:09,253
Of a million little green
fingers Stretching to the sky

164
00:12:09,426 --> 00:12:10,586
Howdy, neighbor

165
00:12:10,760 --> 00:12:13,888
- Howdy, neighbor.
- Happy harvest

166
00:12:14,097 --> 00:12:18,625
Get your rocking chairs
For all your cares are over

167
00:12:18,835 --> 00:12:23,569
Clap your hands and lick your chops
Your bumper crops are on the climb

168
00:12:23,774 --> 00:12:28,337
Hey, we're gonna roll in
plenty Spend a five or 10 or 20

169
00:12:28,513 --> 00:12:32,471
And those happy harvest
bells Are gonna chime

170
00:12:32,717 --> 00:12:37,655
Remember, neighbor When
you work for Mother Nature

171
00:12:37,856 --> 00:12:45,093
You get paid by Father Time

172
00:12:47,532 --> 00:12:51,560
Chicks are gonna cackle
And every burlap sack'll be

173
00:12:51,738 --> 00:12:54,172
Full of taters and tobaccos

174
00:12:54,374 --> 00:12:57,503
And dozens of different
Good and healthy greens

175
00:12:57,678 --> 00:13:01,239
- Do tell.
- And if the weatherman won't upset us

176
00:13:01,448 --> 00:13:03,109
Mister, you can bet us

177
00:13:03,284 --> 00:13:06,879
There'll be lots of crispy
lettuce In your jeans

178
00:13:07,054 --> 00:13:12,152
Corn and taters, you can bet us, Ripe
tomatoes, crispy lettuce in your jeans

179
00:13:12,327 --> 00:13:15,888
Begin to live And find
out just what living means

180
00:13:16,064 --> 00:13:18,157
- Howdy, neighbor
- Howdy, neighbor

181
00:13:18,333 --> 00:13:20,392
- Happy harvest
- Happy harvest

182
00:13:20,568 --> 00:13:23,867
May your 40 acres Soon
be fields of clover

183
00:13:24,039 --> 00:13:26,975
- Yes, indeed
- Go on, puff your corncob pipes

184
00:13:27,143 --> 00:13:29,543
And no more gripes And no more groans

185
00:13:29,779 --> 00:13:31,371
No mortgages or loans

186
00:13:31,548 --> 00:13:33,982
And you won't see a trace of worrying

187
00:13:34,150 --> 00:13:36,675
On the face of Farmer Jones

188
00:13:36,852 --> 00:13:38,821
- Howdy, neighbor
- Howdy, neighbor

189
00:13:38,989 --> 00:13:41,048
- Happy harvest
- Happy harvest

190
00:13:41,224 --> 00:13:45,217
Get your rocking chairs
For all your cares are over

191
00:13:45,429 --> 00:13:49,924
Clap your hands and lick your chops
Your bumper crops are on the climb

192
00:13:50,168 --> 00:13:54,537
Hey, we're gonna roll in
plenty Spend a five or 10 or 20

193
00:13:54,739 --> 00:13:58,436
And those happy harvest
bells Are gonna chime

194
00:13:58,676 --> 00:14:03,444
Remember, neighbor When
you work for Mother Nature

195
00:14:03,682 --> 00:14:10,952
You get paid by Father Time

196
00:14:35,483 --> 00:14:38,351
Hey, give me a hand with these flats.

197
00:14:55,370 --> 00:14:57,737
You! Young lady...

198
00:14:58,174 --> 00:15:04,443
- Wait. Stop that.
- Heave ho. Heave ho. Heave ho.

199
00:15:04,648 --> 00:15:08,243
Oh, wait a minute. Whoa.
Whoa, you slime, whoa!

200
00:15:08,452 --> 00:15:11,011
What's going on here? What
are you doing up there?

201
00:15:11,254 --> 00:15:15,351
I'm looking for a needle. It's the
"needle in the haystack" bit. Funny?

202
00:15:15,526 --> 00:15:16,891
- I love you!
- What?

203
00:15:17,061 --> 00:15:18,585
- Love you...
- Leave me alone.

204
00:15:18,762 --> 00:15:21,095
Impetuous little fool.
No, don't turn your back.

205
00:15:21,299 --> 00:15:23,665
- I want to remember you as you are.
- Now, wait.

206
00:15:23,902 --> 00:15:27,030
Here, this goes in
the house. Hey, Herb...

207
00:15:30,975 --> 00:15:33,604
- Oh, excuse me.
- Hey, Joe, where do we put these flats?

208
00:15:33,813 --> 00:15:35,713
Oh, Herb, come on.
Give us a hand here.

209
00:15:35,915 --> 00:15:38,247
- Now, wait just a minute.
- Fred.

210
00:15:39,718 --> 00:15:41,118
That's my barn.

211
00:15:45,825 --> 00:15:48,158
Quiet!

212
00:16:04,145 --> 00:16:05,806
What are you doing in my barn?

213
00:16:06,013 --> 00:16:07,878
- Your barn?
- Yes!

214
00:16:08,082 --> 00:16:11,644
You're Jane. Hello, I'm Joe
Ross. Say, this setup's perfect.

215
00:16:11,820 --> 00:16:15,653
- Wait till we get the stage, you'll love it.
- A stage? For what?

216
00:16:16,558 --> 00:16:18,719
For the show, my show, Fall in Love.

217
00:16:18,961 --> 00:16:21,486
Mr. Ross, I don't know
anything about you or your show.

218
00:16:21,663 --> 00:16:25,600
Will you tell these people here there's
been some kind of mistake and go away?

219
00:16:25,835 --> 00:16:29,032
You mean you didn't...?
Didrt Abigail write you?

220
00:16:29,239 --> 00:16:31,503
Abigail? What's Abigail
got to do with this?

221
00:16:31,674 --> 00:16:32,834
Jane!

222
00:16:33,743 --> 00:16:35,233
- Jane.
- Abby.

223
00:16:35,411 --> 00:16:37,379
It's wonderful to be home again.

224
00:16:37,581 --> 00:16:40,209
- This is Joe Ross. He's directing the show.
- We've met.

225
00:16:40,384 --> 00:16:42,682
- My sister.
- Abigail...

226
00:16:42,887 --> 00:16:45,083
...did you ask all these people here?

227
00:16:45,290 --> 00:16:47,224
Of course, darling.
And isn't it wonderful?

228
00:16:47,424 --> 00:16:50,587
A musical show in our barn.
Oh, wait till you see my part.

229
00:16:50,761 --> 00:16:53,595
- It's wonderful, isn't it, Joe?
- Yeah, sure.

230
00:16:54,199 --> 00:16:57,635
Abigail, I'd like to
talk to you inside.

231
00:17:00,039 --> 00:17:02,064
Didrt you tell her were coming?

232
00:17:02,275 --> 00:17:07,076
Well, not exactly, Joe. I thought it
would be sort of fun if we surprised her.

233
00:17:08,915 --> 00:17:12,248
- We surprised her, all right.
- Oh, now, Joe, don't worry.

234
00:17:12,451 --> 00:17:15,615
I'll take care of everything.
It'll be all right.

235
00:17:17,758 --> 00:17:19,225
Abig...?

236
00:17:28,136 --> 00:17:30,229
Let's go in here for a minute.

237
00:17:30,438 --> 00:17:33,168
You still haven't gotten the
new curtains for the parlor.

238
00:17:33,408 --> 00:17:36,275
No. I've been pretty busy.

239
00:17:37,345 --> 00:17:39,142
Abigail...

240
00:17:41,115 --> 00:17:43,243
...start from the beginning, huh?

241
00:17:43,452 --> 00:17:48,651
- Well, after I flunked out of art school, I...
- Yes, I felt bad about that.

242
00:17:48,824 --> 00:17:52,624
Oh, darling, I'm sorry. But all my
friends said I should go on the stage.

243
00:17:52,828 --> 00:17:55,422
- That's where I met Joe.
- On the stage?

244
00:17:55,631 --> 00:17:59,830
- No. You see, he, we...
- Where?

245
00:18:00,770 --> 00:18:03,261
In a drugstore on Broadway.

246
00:18:03,941 --> 00:18:07,206
But, Jane, it was really very romantic.
We were both having a sandwich...

247
00:18:07,378 --> 00:18:11,815
...and he... Well, he began to talk
to me and he asked me if I could sing.

248
00:18:12,016 --> 00:18:15,008
The next thing I know, I'm
rehearsing with his show.

249
00:18:16,287 --> 00:18:19,621
Look, Abigail, you just can't
bring all these people here. It...

250
00:18:19,791 --> 00:18:23,352
You don't understand. You see, Joe
needed a place to try out the show.

251
00:18:23,595 --> 00:18:27,087
A place where producers could
see it. We couldn't find anything.

252
00:18:27,299 --> 00:18:30,962
Well, I suggested our barn.
Our barn, just sitting here.

253
00:18:34,374 --> 00:18:38,868
Abigail, darling, this is
a farm. This isn't Broadway.

254
00:18:39,113 --> 00:18:41,842
These people just don't belong
here. They wouldn't fit in.

255
00:18:42,015 --> 00:18:44,142
Once you get to know
them, they're wonderful.

256
00:18:44,317 --> 00:18:46,650
- I'm sure they're...
- They won't be any trouble.

257
00:18:46,854 --> 00:18:48,685
You won't even know they're around.

258
00:18:48,856 --> 00:18:50,847
- Really, darling...
- This must be Mr. Keath.

259
00:18:51,025 --> 00:18:52,617
- Another one?
- Oh, he's our name.

260
00:18:52,826 --> 00:18:54,590
- Name?
- A name people know.

261
00:18:54,763 --> 00:18:57,253
You have to have a
star in the lead. Hi.

262
00:18:57,498 --> 00:18:58,760
Abig...!

263
00:19:02,837 --> 00:19:07,206
And this is the most fascinating
place. However did you find it?

264
00:19:08,277 --> 00:19:10,711
- How do you like this? The bellhop bit.
- Wait.

265
00:19:10,880 --> 00:19:13,370
- What?
- This is Harrison Keath. My sister, Jane.

266
00:19:13,548 --> 00:19:17,007
- How do you do?
- A very talented lady here, Miss Falbury.

267
00:19:17,219 --> 00:19:21,087
And a lovely old house, so utterly
quaint. Which is my room, please?

268
00:19:21,257 --> 00:19:24,557
- No, Abigail. Abigail...
- I'll have tea in my room in half an hour.

269
00:19:24,728 --> 00:19:26,059
In your room...? Wait a minute.

270
00:19:26,263 --> 00:19:28,231
- Tea girl, quickly! To the galley.
- But...

271
00:19:28,431 --> 00:19:30,662
- Your face is familiar.
- Just a moment.

272
00:19:30,867 --> 00:19:32,459
- Where are you going?
- Upstairs.

273
00:19:32,669 --> 00:19:34,694
No, you're not. You
take your bags outside.

274
00:19:34,905 --> 00:19:37,272
Oh, these aren't mine.
They're Abigail's.

275
00:19:38,209 --> 00:19:42,236
Well, Mr. Ross, will
you come in here, please?

276
00:19:48,186 --> 00:19:49,983
Mr. Ross...

277
00:19:51,724 --> 00:19:54,591
...my sister is apt to
be very enthusiastic.

278
00:19:54,793 --> 00:19:56,920
At times, it gets the
better of her judgment.

279
00:19:57,129 --> 00:19:59,826
She should never have invited
you. You all have to leave.

280
00:20:00,066 --> 00:20:02,795
- Have to leave?
- I'm sorry. My farm is important to me.

281
00:20:02,968 --> 00:20:04,936
I've got hard work to
do here. Serious work.

282
00:20:05,138 --> 00:20:07,732
You are gonna have to find
some other place to play.

283
00:20:08,007 --> 00:20:09,770
- Play?
- That's what it is, playing.

284
00:20:09,943 --> 00:20:11,808
- I've got a harvest...
- Wait a minute!

285
00:20:12,011 --> 00:20:16,210
What makes you think putting a show is
a lot of laughs? You ought to try it.

286
00:20:16,417 --> 00:20:18,350
- Mr. Ross...
- Try rehearsing all day...

287
00:20:18,518 --> 00:20:21,784
...knocking yourself out in the same
routine, doing them in your sleep.

288
00:20:22,123 --> 00:20:24,091
That's what these
kids have been doing.

289
00:20:24,291 --> 00:20:26,954
In empty warehouses, garages,
any place they could find.

290
00:20:27,129 --> 00:20:28,756
Your barn looked like a great break.

291
00:20:28,964 --> 00:20:31,865
So we put all the money we had
in second-hand sets and costumes.

292
00:20:32,033 --> 00:20:34,331
Now you want me to tell
them it's no go, deal's off.

293
00:20:34,536 --> 00:20:36,003
I made no deal, Mr. Ross.

294
00:20:36,438 --> 00:20:39,669
- Abigail told me...
- I run this farm.

295
00:20:41,010 --> 00:20:45,242
I don't mean you have to drive back
tonight. You can all sleep in the barn.

296
00:20:45,782 --> 00:20:48,149
But tomorrow you have to leave.

297
00:20:48,786 --> 00:20:50,810
Dinner's at 6:30.

298
00:20:53,256 --> 00:20:55,657
There'll be 24 for dinner, Esme.

299
00:20:55,859 --> 00:20:58,054
Twenty-four!

300
00:20:59,630 --> 00:21:02,623
Would you pass the potatoes, please?

301
00:21:02,834 --> 00:21:06,166
All this very much
reminds me of the time...

302
00:21:06,637 --> 00:21:10,904
Of the time when I was
stranded in Booth City, Iowa.

303
00:21:11,276 --> 00:21:13,107
Very early in my career, of course.

304
00:21:13,278 --> 00:21:15,337
Thank you. May I have
some salt, please?

305
00:21:15,547 --> 00:21:18,210
It seems the county fair
opened simultaneously with us.

306
00:21:18,417 --> 00:21:20,851
Which proved rather
unfortunate, since...

307
00:21:22,420 --> 00:21:24,719
Are there any more
string beans, please?

308
00:21:24,924 --> 00:21:27,552
You wouldn't want a
rubdown, would you?

309
00:21:28,427 --> 00:21:30,224
Thank you.

310
00:21:30,997 --> 00:21:37,333
Ah, well, as we of the theater
say, never become disheartened.

311
00:21:39,072 --> 00:21:41,438
Poor child.

312
00:21:42,342 --> 00:21:44,071
Excuse me.

313
00:21:48,816 --> 00:21:51,011
Come on. Let's clear the table.

314
00:21:53,554 --> 00:21:55,181
Abigail...

315
00:21:55,990 --> 00:21:57,890
...what are you doing?

316
00:21:58,593 --> 00:22:02,530
Darling, now you
mustrt be upset by this.

317
00:22:03,198 --> 00:22:05,962
You don't want to be an actress.
This thing is ridiculous.

318
00:22:06,134 --> 00:22:08,603
Why is it ridiculous?
Because you say so?

319
00:22:08,838 --> 00:22:12,204
You say I don't want to act because
you're not interested in acting.

320
00:22:12,407 --> 00:22:14,603
I notice you're doing
what interests you.

321
00:22:14,777 --> 00:22:17,109
You like farming, so
you expect me to like it.

322
00:22:17,280 --> 00:22:20,215
But it's not fair. I wanna
make something of myself.

323
00:22:20,416 --> 00:22:24,786
I don't wanna sit around, be an old maid
and hoe potatoes for the rest of my life.

324
00:22:24,989 --> 00:22:28,948
I've found something I want
to do and I'm going to do it.

325
00:22:29,159 --> 00:22:33,289
And if you try and stop me,
you're just being selfish, Jane.

326
00:22:37,669 --> 00:22:41,900
- Okay, take these out with you too.
- Okay.

327
00:22:42,106 --> 00:22:44,871
- Attagirl.
- Mr. Ross.

328
00:22:45,577 --> 00:22:49,981
I've changed my mind. You
can stay and put on your show.

329
00:22:54,086 --> 00:22:57,454
Miss Falbury, you don't know
what this means. All right, kids.

330
00:22:57,657 --> 00:23:00,751
All right, kids. Listen, listen
kids. All right. All right.

331
00:23:00,960 --> 00:23:03,190
Look, rehearsal tomorrow, 10:00 sharp.

332
00:23:03,396 --> 00:23:07,595
Wait a minute. No. Wait, wait. Wait
a minute. You didn't let me finish.

333
00:23:07,801 --> 00:23:12,603
You see, a farm can't support
a lot of people who do nothing.

334
00:23:12,807 --> 00:23:15,172
Things don't just grow, you know.

335
00:23:15,409 --> 00:23:18,846
There are chores to be done,
milking, weeding, candling...

336
00:23:19,447 --> 00:23:24,783
...and I'm afraid you're...
You're all going to have to help.

337
00:23:25,521 --> 00:23:28,820
Now, we start tomorrow morning at 6.

338
00:23:35,864 --> 00:23:37,627
Okay.

339
00:23:38,701 --> 00:23:40,465
Good night.

340
00:23:40,971 --> 00:23:44,168
Six o'clock? Hey, Joe, I didn't
come up here to be an early bird.

341
00:23:44,374 --> 00:23:46,739
- Now, listen. Listen, everybody.
- Quiet! Quiet!

342
00:23:46,943 --> 00:23:48,706
- We've got a chance...
- Good night.

343
00:23:48,878 --> 00:23:52,041
- Good night. Good night.
- We got a chance to put on this show.

344
00:23:52,248 --> 00:23:56,379
Now, suppose we have to milk cows
or pick eggs or make with a hoe?

345
00:23:56,587 --> 00:23:59,021
- What of it? What's so tough about it?
- Joe, I don't...

346
00:23:59,190 --> 00:24:01,557
- You want everything to fall in your lap?
- No.

347
00:24:01,727 --> 00:24:04,661
Do you want to quit now
and give up the whole show?

348
00:24:05,463 --> 00:24:08,399
- Go back to rehearsing in warehouses?
- No.

349
00:24:08,567 --> 00:24:09,556
Well?

350
00:24:09,868 --> 00:24:13,531
I hear your message,
brother. Show me the way.

351
00:24:13,739 --> 00:24:17,176
You're wise and good. I don't wanna
be a lazy no-account like you all.

352
00:24:17,377 --> 00:24:19,367
I wanna be saved.

353
00:24:20,012 --> 00:24:21,912
Save me.

354
00:24:22,347 --> 00:24:23,781
Save me.

355
00:24:24,017 --> 00:24:27,350
Well, I don't wanna sound
like I'm preaching a sermon.

356
00:24:27,520 --> 00:24:29,420
Oh, preach to me. Preach.

357
00:24:29,622 --> 00:24:33,559
But I've heard people say

358
00:24:33,727 --> 00:24:35,387
What did they say?

359
00:24:35,595 --> 00:24:38,929
They said, "The early
bird catches the worm. "

360
00:24:39,133 --> 00:24:42,296
And there's a lot of good
logic In that old cliché

361
00:24:42,503 --> 00:24:45,564
You know, he's right. Listen
to him, children. He's right.

362
00:24:45,774 --> 00:24:49,232
There are certain obligations
you just can't shirk.

363
00:24:49,444 --> 00:24:52,504
You gotta put the heat
on To make the kettle perk

364
00:24:52,714 --> 00:24:55,581
Now, ain't that the truth?
Are you listening to the man?

365
00:24:55,784 --> 00:24:59,277
This is the man who saved
me. I was wicked. I was blind.

366
00:24:59,455 --> 00:25:01,150
This is the man who showed me the way.

367
00:25:01,323 --> 00:25:04,121
Took me by the hand
up to the glory river.

368
00:25:04,326 --> 00:25:05,817
This man showed me the light.

369
00:25:06,063 --> 00:25:08,462
This man here. This is the
man who give me the beat.

370
00:25:08,664 --> 00:25:12,225
This is the man who made
me be righteous. This man.

371
00:25:13,336 --> 00:25:17,636
And if you want it to be a good day

372
00:25:18,241 --> 00:25:21,700
You gotta do a good day's work

373
00:25:23,113 --> 00:25:26,241
You gotta dig, dig,
dig Dig for your dinner

374
00:25:26,416 --> 00:25:28,544
Nothing's what you get for free

375
00:25:28,753 --> 00:25:31,745
You gotta dig, dig,
dig Dig for your dinner

376
00:25:31,923 --> 00:25:33,982
Never was a money tree

377
00:25:34,193 --> 00:25:37,162
And furthermore, my
friends, I must repeat

378
00:25:37,362 --> 00:25:39,829
Nobody's living down on Easy Street

379
00:25:39,997 --> 00:25:42,728
And if you wanna owe for groceries

380
00:25:42,901 --> 00:25:45,335
You're gonna get An
awful lot of "No, sirees"

381
00:25:45,504 --> 00:25:48,440
You gotta dig, dig,
dig Dig for a dollar

382
00:25:48,608 --> 00:25:50,599
'Tain't as simple as you think

383
00:25:50,810 --> 00:25:55,975
You can't purloin a sirloin Or
the butcher'll put you in the clink

384
00:25:56,683 --> 00:26:01,279
You just can't be a lazy bird
You gotta get off of your twig

385
00:26:02,155 --> 00:26:04,681
So you can afford Your
room and your board

386
00:26:04,859 --> 00:26:06,918
And it's nice to have
the price of a cig

387
00:26:07,228 --> 00:26:12,461
Hey, you gotta pay the fiddler
man If you wanna do a jig

388
00:26:12,666 --> 00:26:18,037
You gotta be as busy as
a bee To be a Mister B-I-G

389
00:26:18,206 --> 00:26:20,674
And if you want
some dig-dig-dignity

390
00:26:20,842 --> 00:26:23,970
You gotta dig, dig, dig
Dig, dig for your dinner

391
00:26:24,179 --> 00:26:26,808
- Dig, dig, dig, dig, dig
- Hear him talking to you

392
00:26:26,982 --> 00:26:29,542
- Dig, brother, dig
- That's the spirit, brother

393
00:26:29,718 --> 00:26:32,153
- Dig, brother, dig
- Join the chorus, brothers

394
00:26:32,321 --> 00:26:36,382
Dig, brother dig, brother
Dig, dig, dig, dig, dig

395
00:26:36,559 --> 00:26:38,424
That's right You gotta see the light

396
00:26:38,629 --> 00:26:41,189
You gotta pull your load
You gotta dig the ground

397
00:26:41,365 --> 00:26:42,389
You gotta get it hoed

398
00:26:42,566 --> 00:26:46,024
- You gotta pitch right in or hit the road
- Save me!

399
00:26:46,203 --> 00:26:47,261
You're saved

400
00:26:47,704 --> 00:26:50,537
You gotta feed the
chickens Gotta milk the cow

401
00:26:50,707 --> 00:26:53,233
You gotta stack the hay
You gotta push the plow

402
00:26:53,411 --> 00:26:56,539
You gotta feed, milk,
stack, push The time is now

403
00:26:56,748 --> 00:26:58,238
And dig, dig, dig, dig, dig

- You gotta see your dentist twice a year
- And dig, dig, dig, dig

407
00:27:08,928 --> 00:27:11,658
- Dig, brother, dig

Dig for your dinner It's
harder than you think

416
00:27:52,507 --> 00:27:55,704
Purloin a sirloin And

You just can't be a lazy bird

So you'll afford your room and

On our feet. On our
feet. Hit the floor.

433
00:29:34,351 --> 00:29:36,216
On our feet.

434
00:29:46,063 --> 00:29:47,291
Joe.

435
00:29:50,201 --> 00:29:54,662
Good morning. Good morning. Did
you have a good night's rest?

436
00:29:56,540 --> 00:30:00,033
You three girls weed the truck garden.
You can each get a hoe over there.

437
00:30:00,245 --> 00:30:03,271
And you two clean the pen,
feed the pigs. Right over there.

438
00:30:03,482 --> 00:30:08,284
Clean the henouse and feed the chickens.
I'll bring the grain in a minute.

439
00:30:08,488 --> 00:30:10,786
Separate the cream, give
the skim milk to the hogs.

440
00:30:10,957 --> 00:30:14,256
You better help her. No, it's
over that way. That's right.

441
00:30:14,460 --> 00:30:16,860
- Do you know how to milk cows?
- Sure.

442
00:30:17,063 --> 00:30:21,626
Well, you'll find the pails in the milk
house. You'd better oil the harness.

443
00:30:21,869 --> 00:30:25,100
Come on. Pretty piggy. Here, piggy.

444
00:30:25,439 --> 00:30:27,908
Here, piggy. Piggy, piggy. Come on.

445
00:30:28,109 --> 00:30:29,336
All right.

446
00:30:29,510 --> 00:30:34,379
Pig, pig, pig, pig, pig. That's right.

447
00:30:47,429 --> 00:30:48,920
All right, chickens.

448
00:30:49,565 --> 00:30:51,499
Hey, chickens. Look what I got.

449
00:30:51,667 --> 00:30:55,125
- Hey, chicken. Here, chick...
- Here, chick, chick. Here chick, chick, chick.

450
00:30:55,304 --> 00:30:57,000
Here, chick, chick, chick.

451
00:30:59,543 --> 00:31:01,510
Here, chick. Here,
chick, chick, chick.

452
00:31:01,677 --> 00:31:04,704
Chick. All right, here.
Here, chick. Chick, chick.

453
00:31:07,217 --> 00:31:09,708
Say, I think this is
gonna work out all right.

454
00:31:09,953 --> 00:31:11,546
At least we got a few extra hands.

455
00:31:11,722 --> 00:31:13,553
Extra mouths too. Look at that.

456
00:31:13,724 --> 00:31:15,453
Why not get some girls in to help you?

457
00:31:15,626 --> 00:31:18,789
No, thanks. I'd rather
break them myself.

458
00:31:19,063 --> 00:31:20,792
Actresses.

459
00:31:20,998 --> 00:31:25,629
I knew it was going to happen someday.
Either you or Abigail going on the stage.

460
00:31:25,838 --> 00:31:29,467
Felt it in my bones. The whole
thing's your Aunt Matilda's fault.

461
00:31:29,675 --> 00:31:31,734
Run off with a vaudeville
magician in 1919.

462
00:31:31,945 --> 00:31:34,242
Three months after they
married, he disappeared.

463
00:31:34,480 --> 00:31:37,472
Never saw hide nor hair of him.
Family hushed it up, of course.

464
00:31:37,683 --> 00:31:41,381
- I used to catch her out in the barn.
- Hey, Es, look. Joe Ross.

465
00:31:41,588 --> 00:31:44,580
"Those kids have talent,"
she'd say, "real talent. "

466
00:31:45,258 --> 00:31:47,227
"Never mind their
talent," I says to her.

467
00:31:47,461 --> 00:31:48,893
- Where's your talent...
- Please.

468
00:31:49,095 --> 00:31:50,585
Where did you learn to dance?

469
00:31:50,763 --> 00:31:53,995
- Her Aunt Matilda, a real scatterbrain.
- Esme, please.

470
00:31:54,201 --> 00:31:56,863
You're good. It must
run in the family.

471
00:31:57,071 --> 00:31:58,436
Here. Try this one:

472
00:32:02,844 --> 00:32:06,279
What's wrong? Too tough? Come
on, you can do it if you try.

473
00:32:06,480 --> 00:32:07,971
- Look...
- Oh, she don't have to.

474
00:32:08,183 --> 00:32:13,348
- Jane's brains are in her head, not her feet.
- Oh, Joe. Good morning, darling.

475
00:32:21,696 --> 00:32:25,030
- It's a good morning now.
- Your orange juice is in the refrigerator.

476
00:32:25,735 --> 00:32:27,430
- Good morning, Jane, Es.
- Good morning.

477
00:32:27,637 --> 00:32:29,002
Don't go, I'll be right back.

478
00:32:29,206 --> 00:32:32,937
I think we've wasted enough time.
Have you finished with the milking?

479
00:32:33,243 --> 00:32:34,733
Well, sure.

480
00:32:43,888 --> 00:32:45,412
There you are.

481
00:32:45,623 --> 00:32:48,217
- This is from 10 cows?
- No, nine.

482
00:32:48,393 --> 00:32:50,258
We've got another whole cow to go yet.

483
00:32:50,461 --> 00:32:53,430
- We usually get a 135 quarts a day.
- What?

484
00:32:53,631 --> 00:32:55,496
They'll never do it. I'll never do it.

485
00:32:55,667 --> 00:32:57,396
I think you could do if you tried.

486
00:32:58,237 --> 00:32:59,898
Actors.

487
00:33:00,105 --> 00:33:03,438
Oh, Joe, you're not going to
leave without saying goodbye?

488
00:33:04,343 --> 00:33:08,110
So long. See you next Thursday.

489
00:33:11,951 --> 00:33:14,978
Oh, isn't he wonderful?

490
00:33:18,091 --> 00:33:21,528
It's ridiculous. It's ridiculous.

491
00:33:22,463 --> 00:33:24,328
- Hi, Lem.
- Hi, Zeke.

492
00:33:24,565 --> 00:33:26,795
Think the rairll hurt the rhubarb?

493
00:33:27,702 --> 00:33:29,761
Show business? What
do you think I'm doing?

494
00:33:29,971 --> 00:33:33,099
- Picking eggs.
Eggs. E-G-Z. - Herb?

495
00:33:33,307 --> 00:33:35,299
- What?
- Can you milk a cow?

496
00:33:35,510 --> 00:33:36,977
- Certainly.
- You can?

497
00:33:37,179 --> 00:33:38,578
- Certainly.
- Look, Herb.

498
00:33:38,780 --> 00:33:42,307
I'll pick the eggs, you milk the
cow. It's a deal, huh? Thank you.

499
00:33:45,587 --> 00:33:47,282
I lied.

500
00:33:50,159 --> 00:33:53,617
Well, you play ball with me, I'll
play ball with you. All right?

501
00:33:55,633 --> 00:33:57,896
How are you? Here we go. Ready?

502
00:33:59,068 --> 00:34:00,330
Go!

503
00:34:07,645 --> 00:34:10,672
Some of us are not trying.

504
00:34:11,983 --> 00:34:14,917
Just give me one, huh? One egg?

505
00:34:30,702 --> 00:34:34,230
You don't have to steal
them. They belong to us.

506
00:34:34,440 --> 00:34:36,908
The chickens don't think so.

507
00:34:45,520 --> 00:34:48,352
Mr. Ross, what are your plans?

508
00:34:48,555 --> 00:34:51,285
I mean, concerning Abigail.

509
00:34:52,727 --> 00:34:57,096
- Oh, that.
- It's only natural that I'd be concerned.

510
00:34:57,265 --> 00:35:02,225
I mean, she is my younger sister. I've
taken care of her all of my life. And...

511
00:35:02,437 --> 00:35:04,769
Wait a minute. Wait a
minute. Don't get upset.

512
00:35:05,440 --> 00:35:08,877
Certainly, you've got a right
to know about Abigail and me.

513
00:35:09,078 --> 00:35:10,909
Here's how it is.

514
00:35:11,213 --> 00:35:12,737
I like Abby.

515
00:35:12,948 --> 00:35:15,941
I like her a lot.
Right now, I'm broke.

516
00:35:16,586 --> 00:35:19,383
I own a station wagon
and a pile of debts.

517
00:35:19,588 --> 00:35:21,819
My whole future is
tied up in this show.

518
00:35:22,258 --> 00:35:25,819
If it's a hit, I get
clear, we'll be all set.

519
00:35:26,329 --> 00:35:28,264
If it's a bust...

520
00:35:28,799 --> 00:35:32,064
Well, I won't ask Abby to
marry me on a breadline.

521
00:35:35,973 --> 00:35:38,203
So you see, you've got
nothing to worry about.

522
00:35:45,283 --> 00:35:47,444
Who opened the gate?

523
00:35:59,799 --> 00:36:04,134
Who's got my glasses?
Glasses. Who's got my glasses?

524
00:36:04,338 --> 00:36:05,999
Oh, I see.

525
00:36:06,839 --> 00:36:08,500
What happened?

526
00:36:11,512 --> 00:36:14,481
- This doesn't feel right.
- Guess we've got the wrong glasses.

527
00:36:14,681 --> 00:36:16,842
- Let me see.
- Those are my glasses.

528
00:36:17,050 --> 00:36:19,485
- Don't get panicky now.
- Give them to me!

529
00:36:19,687 --> 00:36:23,144
- Have you seen Jane?
- Seen Jane? I can't see the house.

530
00:36:24,358 --> 00:36:28,295
- Oh, you all right, stranger?
- I'm all right, thank you.

531
00:36:28,496 --> 00:36:30,327
You don't see very well, do you?

532
00:36:30,532 --> 00:36:33,127
- Orville. Orville, what happened?
- I'm all right.

533
00:36:33,335 --> 00:36:35,860
- Oh, he's terribly nearsighted.
- You got all dirty.

534
00:36:36,071 --> 00:36:38,266
Jane, what's this I hear
about a show? Actors?

535
00:36:38,474 --> 00:36:43,207
Please, no, the dust. My allergy.
The whole town is... The whole...

536
00:36:44,480 --> 00:36:46,141
Gesundheit.

537
00:36:46,348 --> 00:36:48,340
Father wants to see
you in town right away.

538
00:36:48,552 --> 00:36:52,113
He says there's a rumor in
town that these people are...

539
00:36:53,223 --> 00:36:56,215
- Gesundheit.
- Well, Orville, it isn't exactly a rumor.

540
00:36:56,426 --> 00:36:58,690
You mean that they...

541
00:36:59,696 --> 00:37:01,927
- Gesundheit.
- He's catching cold.

542
00:37:02,166 --> 00:37:05,602
Well, I'm going in town for
a while. I'll be back shortly.

543
00:37:05,837 --> 00:37:10,070
Oh, you. Get off that tractor.
I don't want that touched.

544
00:37:10,908 --> 00:37:13,672
- You're an actor, huh?
- Oh, yeah. Joe Ross is my name.

545
00:37:13,878 --> 00:37:15,243
- How do you do?
- How do you do?

546
00:37:15,414 --> 00:37:18,713
- Miss Falbury is my fiancée.
- No.

547
00:37:18,917 --> 00:37:22,409
- Just thought I'd tell you.
- Oh, well, congratulations.

548
00:37:22,622 --> 00:37:26,558
- We've been engaged for four years.
- You don't say.

549
00:37:26,759 --> 00:37:30,627
- Well, don't rush into anything.
- We won't, thank you.

550
00:37:31,598 --> 00:37:33,930
- Gesundheit.
- Come on, Orville.

551
00:37:34,133 --> 00:37:36,658
Well, busy, busy, busy.

552
00:37:37,938 --> 00:37:41,237
- Hiya, farmer.
- Hiya, think the rairll hurt the rhubarb?

553
00:37:43,710 --> 00:37:45,474
Oh, for heavers sake.

554
00:37:50,484 --> 00:37:51,918
Funny?

555
00:37:52,254 --> 00:37:56,247
Can't you find him a job someplace
where he can't do any damage?

556
00:37:57,492 --> 00:38:00,052
- Good morning. Joe.
- Good morning.

557
00:38:03,265 --> 00:38:05,256
- Good morning.
- Good morning. How are you?

558
00:38:05,468 --> 00:38:07,868
Glad you came. We're
rehearsing "Memory Island. "

559
00:38:08,070 --> 00:38:09,662
I'd like you to see. Oh, girls...

560
00:38:09,906 --> 00:38:12,101
...get on the train,
remember what we've set.

561
00:38:12,408 --> 00:38:13,740
- It's a rough start.
- Surely.

562
00:38:13,944 --> 00:38:16,605
The setting is, the two
of you are on an island.

563
00:38:16,812 --> 00:38:18,871
- What'll I wear?
- Well, I don't know yet.

564
00:38:19,081 --> 00:38:22,279
At any rate, Harrison, when the
curtain goes up you're all alone.

565
00:38:22,486 --> 00:38:25,011
- How about my pink dress?
- Well, maybe the pink dress.

566
00:38:25,255 --> 00:38:28,157
Back here, there's a tropical
garden. A mass of hibiscus...

567
00:38:28,393 --> 00:38:31,384
Oh, but Joe, hibiscus is red.
It would clash with the pink.

568
00:38:31,595 --> 00:38:33,996
- We'll change the flowers. That's easy.
- Thank you.

569
00:38:34,198 --> 00:38:36,928
And now, Harrison. Girls.
Hold it down, will you, please?

570
00:38:37,135 --> 00:38:40,002
Back here, there's a sky blue
cyc. White, fleecy clouds...

571
00:38:40,204 --> 00:38:43,299
You know then, I'd rather see
myself in tweeds for this number.

572
00:38:43,509 --> 00:38:46,535
Yes. Yes. Tweeds would be fine.
Now, the ballet enters upstage.

573
00:38:46,779 --> 00:38:49,509
- Perhaps this very jacket.
- Wonderful, I love this jacket.

574
00:38:49,715 --> 00:38:52,809
Thank you. Not these trousers.
I have eggshell flannels...

575
00:38:53,018 --> 00:38:55,213
Better, I've a dress
that the line is casual...

576
00:38:55,455 --> 00:38:57,150
- Pardon me, Harrison.
- Yes, Joe?

577
00:38:57,357 --> 00:38:58,949
Wardrobe later, try the number.

578
00:38:59,159 --> 00:39:01,059
- Surely.
- Curtairs up, you're here.

579
00:39:01,294 --> 00:39:03,524
- Let's say this is a log.
- I wondered what it was.

580
00:39:03,697 --> 00:39:06,063
Good. I'll get you a lyric.

581
00:39:06,700 --> 00:39:08,429
Thank you.

582
00:39:08,802 --> 00:39:11,670
- Harrison.
- Oh, I know my lyrics, old boy.

583
00:39:11,872 --> 00:39:13,203
- Like this, Joe?
- Yes, good.

584
00:39:13,441 --> 00:39:15,966
All right, kids. Places,
please, for the number.

585
00:39:16,177 --> 00:39:18,942
All right, Artie. Slowly, please.

586
00:39:19,147 --> 00:39:25,450
Sail away with me to Memory Island

587
00:39:26,154 --> 00:39:28,315
I think it would be better standing.

588
00:39:28,523 --> 00:39:34,190
- Enchanting Never Say Goodbye Land

589
00:39:34,864 --> 00:39:41,030
Strolling on the
sands of time together

590
00:39:41,237 --> 00:39:42,727
Lovely. Lovely.

591
00:39:42,972 --> 00:39:48,343
Time will help us
find the love we knew

592
00:39:48,545 --> 00:39:50,843
No, no, no. Next chorus.

593
00:39:53,517 --> 00:40:00,390
Drifting on the Bay
of Can't Forget You

594
00:40:01,860 --> 00:40:08,732
Moonbeams will relight
The night I met you

595
00:40:10,268 --> 00:40:18,040
I'll know then we'll meet again
When yester dreams come true

596
00:40:18,411 --> 00:40:24,577
Somewhere on Memory
Island Lost with you

597
00:40:25,918 --> 00:40:30,253
This is the ballet: Sea nymphs, water
sprites, mermaids all around you.

598
00:40:30,691 --> 00:40:32,158
Proteus rising from the sea.

599
00:40:32,392 --> 00:40:39,094
Drifting on the Bay
of Can't Forget You

600
00:40:39,333 --> 00:40:40,663
Splendid.

601
00:40:40,901 --> 00:40:47,774
Moonbeams will relight
The night I met you

602
00:40:48,910 --> 00:40:52,745
I'll know then we'll meet again

603
00:40:52,948 --> 00:40:55,610
When yester dreams come true

604
00:40:55,818 --> 00:40:57,149
Harry.

605
00:40:57,352 --> 00:41:04,121
Somewhere on Memory
Island Lost with you

606
00:41:07,130 --> 00:41:13,763
Somewhere on Memory Island

607
00:41:14,537 --> 00:41:21,205
Lost with you

608
00:41:31,689 --> 00:41:35,592
Get out of the way. I'll
take care of it. No stump...

609
00:41:38,029 --> 00:41:40,328
Don't scratch that tractor.

610
00:41:40,533 --> 00:41:42,501
Herb. Herb, turn it off!

611
00:41:45,337 --> 00:41:47,465
Shut off the switch!

612
00:41:59,820 --> 00:42:01,150
Herb!

613
00:42:23,212 --> 00:42:27,239
Herb! Herb! Herb, you pinead!

614
00:42:27,449 --> 00:42:31,079
If you can hear me, don't
come out! I'll slaughter you!

615
00:42:31,288 --> 00:42:35,053
I'll slaughter you! Oh, Herb!

616
00:42:36,025 --> 00:42:38,586
But how can theatrical
people help out on a farm?

617
00:42:38,795 --> 00:42:40,160
You don't need any help.

618
00:42:40,363 --> 00:42:42,388
Just yesterday I let
you have a new tractor.

619
00:42:42,599 --> 00:42:45,797
I know, Mr. Wingait. It's
beautiful and I thank you for it.

620
00:42:46,037 --> 00:42:48,767
But all they want to do is
put on their show and leave.

621
00:42:48,972 --> 00:42:53,410
I wonder what the first Falburys would
think of using their barn for a musical.

622
00:42:53,611 --> 00:42:59,414
- Well, we're using it for a dance tonight.
- I don't think that's the same. Is it, Dad?

623
00:42:59,618 --> 00:43:03,315
The Wingait Falls Historic Society has
held these dances for over a hundred years.

624
00:43:03,555 --> 00:43:05,887
- Square dancing is tradition.
- That's what I meant.

625
00:43:06,091 --> 00:43:08,457
In 1594, there was a law
passed in this community...

626
00:43:08,694 --> 00:43:11,219
...prohibiting theatrical
entertainments of any kind.

627
00:43:11,430 --> 00:43:16,300
Do you know who proposed that law?
Your ancestor, Phineas Falbury.

628
00:43:16,502 --> 00:43:20,439
I'm sure that in 1694, Uncle Phineas
must have a good reason for it.

629
00:43:20,641 --> 00:43:23,200
The reason still exists.
This is a farm community.

630
00:43:23,409 --> 00:43:26,242
- These people don't belong.
- What about the dance tonight?

631
00:43:26,446 --> 00:43:28,506
Yes, these dances are
important to us, Jane.

632
00:43:28,749 --> 00:43:30,148
I know, Mr. Wingait but...

633
00:43:30,317 --> 00:43:31,784
Orville...

634
00:43:32,052 --> 00:43:36,547
Please, please trust me. I promise
you they won't interfere in any way.

635
00:44:07,891 --> 00:44:09,949
What do you think, Artie?

636
00:44:10,294 --> 00:44:12,626
Maybe if I had a week
or so to work on her.

637
00:44:12,829 --> 00:44:15,354
A week? This thing's gotta
be rolling by tomorrow.

638
00:44:15,565 --> 00:44:18,034
This thing? There's maybe
a hundred parts busted.

639
00:44:18,269 --> 00:44:19,668
A hund...?

640
00:44:20,305 --> 00:44:22,205
Start talking.

641
00:44:23,908 --> 00:44:26,399
- Well, rear axle.
- Rear axle.

642
00:44:26,644 --> 00:44:28,839
- Drive shaft.
- Drive shaft.

643
00:44:31,850 --> 00:44:33,784
- Brake drum.
- Brake drum.

644
00:44:36,755 --> 00:44:38,052
Ladies and gentlemen...

645
00:44:38,290 --> 00:44:41,454
...to close the meeting of the
Wingait Falls Historical Society...

646
00:44:41,660 --> 00:44:45,289
...we will dance an old
favorite, "The Portland Fancy. "

647
00:44:45,497 --> 00:44:48,365
Everybody will dance this.
Would those folks back there...

648
00:44:48,568 --> 00:44:52,026
...please move the chairs away because
we're gonna need plenty of room.

649
00:44:52,272 --> 00:44:55,401
All right, now. Choose your partners.

650
00:45:00,381 --> 00:45:03,373
All join hands, circle to the left.

651
00:45:08,323 --> 00:45:11,053
End gents over, sashay down the line.

652
00:45:12,294 --> 00:45:14,854
Sashay back to your places.

653
00:45:16,098 --> 00:45:17,861
Sashay in line. Ladies in the lead.

654
00:45:18,066 --> 00:45:22,163
Turn your partners one and all
Half right and left across the hall

655
00:45:22,372 --> 00:45:24,670
Dig the squares, they're having a ball

656
00:45:24,841 --> 00:45:26,069
Quiet, we'll get in trouble.

657
00:45:26,609 --> 00:45:29,841
- Crankcase.
- One crankcase.

658
00:45:30,046 --> 00:45:33,072
- Need a front tire too, Joe.
- One front tire.

659
00:45:33,316 --> 00:45:35,546
How are the back ones?

660
00:45:36,920 --> 00:45:39,115
- Hi, what do you want?
- We want to hide here.

661
00:45:39,356 --> 00:45:41,688
I'm sorry. We're busy.
Come back some other time.

662
00:45:41,892 --> 00:45:44,953
Find some other place
to play. Attaboy.

663
00:45:46,130 --> 00:45:51,763
- Hey, that was Miss Jane's new tractor.
- Let's go ask if we can have the tires.

664
00:45:53,938 --> 00:45:55,428
Hey.

665
00:45:56,574 --> 00:45:59,237
Come here. Where have you
been? Take that hat off.

666
00:45:59,445 --> 00:46:01,640
Miss Jane, Miss Jane,
I just saw your...!

667
00:46:02,514 --> 00:46:04,539
May I have this dance?

668
00:46:16,263 --> 00:46:17,662
Hey, look, there's Joe.

669
00:46:19,066 --> 00:46:21,057
- What are we waiting for?
- Hi, Joe.

670
00:46:22,102 --> 00:46:24,366
Come on, everybody. Come on.

671
00:46:25,906 --> 00:46:27,602
Joe's down there. Here we come.

672
00:46:27,809 --> 00:46:29,504
Get back up there.

673
00:46:30,011 --> 00:46:32,138
Geronimo!

674
00:46:49,132 --> 00:46:50,962
Get back up there.

675
00:46:52,801 --> 00:46:54,632
Stay back there.

676
00:49:22,863 --> 00:49:26,561
We'd better break it
up, kids. Go ahead.

677
00:49:28,937 --> 00:49:33,374
Well, Jane, that's a fine finish to
the meeting of the Historical Society.

678
00:49:33,575 --> 00:49:35,440
I thought they werert
going to interfere.

679
00:49:35,610 --> 00:49:38,875
I'm not talking to you. I suggest
you ask these people to clear out.

680
00:49:39,114 --> 00:49:41,083
Well, I can't. They're helping me.

681
00:49:41,284 --> 00:49:44,651
When you need help, you ask your
own people. Charity begins at home.

682
00:49:44,854 --> 00:49:48,085
Yesterday, you wanted a tractor. I
gave it to you, no strings attached...

683
00:49:48,257 --> 00:49:50,191
It's the second time
you've brought that up.

684
00:49:50,359 --> 00:49:53,328
Mr. Wingait, if that's bothering
you, I'll bring the tractor back.

685
00:49:53,529 --> 00:49:55,225
- Take it easy.
- You keep out of this.

686
00:49:55,465 --> 00:49:57,626
I didn't mean it that
way. I didn't say that.

687
00:49:57,834 --> 00:50:00,826
I did, Mr. Wingait. You'll get
your tractor in the morning.

688
00:50:01,039 --> 00:50:02,802
- Don't say that, Jane.
- Keep quiet.

689
00:50:03,007 --> 00:50:05,406
I refuse to accept it.
I won't even hear of it.

690
00:50:05,642 --> 00:50:09,101
- Good night. Good night, Jane.
- Mr. Wingait...

691
00:50:09,714 --> 00:50:12,512
Well, just the same,
he's going to get it.

692
00:50:13,484 --> 00:50:16,511
Jane, you're being silly about
this. I mean, why make enemies?

693
00:50:16,722 --> 00:50:20,418
If the man wants you to keep his
tractor, well, make him happy. Keep it.

694
00:50:20,658 --> 00:50:24,220
Now, listen, don't you try to
tell me how to run my affairs.

695
00:50:25,664 --> 00:50:29,533
All right. You're gonna find out about
it anyway, you might as well know it now.

696
00:50:29,736 --> 00:50:32,899
- Find out about what?
- Now, don't get too excited, that's all.

697
00:50:33,139 --> 00:50:36,836
You see, the tractor...
We had a little accident.

698
00:50:37,043 --> 00:50:41,878
- Don't tell me you scratched the paint!
- Yeah.

699
00:50:50,524 --> 00:50:55,393
Oh, it's not too bad. All
we need's a couple of parts.

700
00:50:55,763 --> 00:50:59,564
Now, don't worry. We'll fix it.
Artie's a great little mechanic.

701
00:50:59,768 --> 00:51:01,895
No, wait a minute, please.

702
00:51:07,276 --> 00:51:10,369
What's the matter?
How stupid can you...?

703
00:51:10,679 --> 00:51:13,547
- Oh, hello, Joe. Where you been?
- Come here.

704
00:51:13,750 --> 00:51:18,619
I meant to tell you. I was in the tractor,
I was trying to get the stump out and:

705
00:51:19,389 --> 00:51:21,790
You know what I mean?
You're not listening, Joe.

706
00:51:21,992 --> 00:51:24,755
I'm trying to explain, you
see? You all right, Joe?

707
00:51:24,961 --> 00:51:26,793
Joe, now wait. I can... Joe. Joe.

708
00:51:26,997 --> 00:51:30,455
- Now, wait a minute. Joe.
- I swear if...

709
00:51:32,703 --> 00:51:35,901
Flipping down out at that hayloft,
stamping, yelling, hooting...

710
00:51:36,107 --> 00:51:37,972
...hollering like
a tribe of Indians...

711
00:51:38,209 --> 00:51:40,972
What are you doing? Are you
listening on the party line?

712
00:51:41,212 --> 00:51:43,942
Those Fliggerton sisters,
buzzing like a beehive.

713
00:51:44,149 --> 00:51:45,514
I can imagine.

714
00:51:45,750 --> 00:51:47,115
- Who's that for?
- Abigail.

715
00:51:47,318 --> 00:51:49,947
- She isn't up?
- According to what you call being up.

716
00:51:50,156 --> 00:51:52,522
She's up enough to want
her breakfast in bed.

717
00:51:52,758 --> 00:51:54,749
I'll take that.

718
00:51:56,595 --> 00:51:59,530
- She learned such
a thing I don't know.

719
00:51:59,698 --> 00:52:01,996
Disgraceful, just disgraceful.

720
00:52:02,234 --> 00:52:04,863
I never saw such a
disgraceful thing in my life.

721
00:52:05,105 --> 00:52:08,802
It's just that I'm tired,
so terribly tired. L...

722
00:52:10,278 --> 00:52:12,438
I think you should go now.

723
00:52:12,946 --> 00:52:15,972
- Oh, good morning, Jane. How sweet.
- You think so?

724
00:52:16,183 --> 00:52:17,515
I think you should go...

725
00:52:17,752 --> 00:52:20,482
From now on, you come down in
the kitchen and have breakfast.

726
00:52:20,688 --> 00:52:22,781
When you're finished,
get into a pair of jeans.

727
00:52:22,990 --> 00:52:25,824
- Jeans?
- You'll do a little work here for a change.

728
00:52:26,028 --> 00:52:29,326
I'm giving Joe Ross and his friends
10 minutes to clear off this farm.

729
00:52:29,497 --> 00:52:30,555
Jane, you can't.

730
00:52:30,731 --> 00:52:34,224
- The costumes and lights arrive...
- I don't care about costumes and lights.

731
00:52:34,403 --> 00:52:35,631
I've had all I can take.

732
00:52:35,871 --> 00:52:39,273
These people are completely
irresponsible, thoughtless, destructive...

733
00:52:39,476 --> 00:52:41,876
And I'm not gonna have
them making you that way.

734
00:52:42,078 --> 00:52:44,545
- Lf they're leaving, so am I.
- No, you're not.

735
00:52:44,780 --> 00:52:47,682
You're gonna stay here. I've
pampered you and spoiled you...

736
00:52:47,884 --> 00:52:51,650
...all of your life. But this
farm is ours, yours and mine.

737
00:52:51,855 --> 00:52:55,917
The debts are half yours too. And you're
gonna stay and help me work them out.

738
00:52:56,160 --> 00:53:00,530
- But I can't...
- Without any argument or tears or whining.

739
00:53:00,731 --> 00:53:02,596
Do you understand?

740
00:53:03,400 --> 00:53:06,233
Yes. Yes, I understand.

741
00:53:15,181 --> 00:53:16,546
What?

742
00:53:18,350 --> 00:53:19,715
What...?

743
00:53:19,918 --> 00:53:23,377
- How did you...?
- I told you Artie was a great mechanic.

744
00:53:23,589 --> 00:53:27,821
A couple of parts, new
tires, that's all she needed.

745
00:53:28,762 --> 00:53:30,423
Shipshape.

746
00:53:32,432 --> 00:53:35,195
Don't touch it. The paint may be wet.

747
00:53:37,971 --> 00:53:40,235
All right. It's a new one.

748
00:53:40,440 --> 00:53:44,104
We busted your tractor. The
cast chipped in. There it is.

749
00:53:45,647 --> 00:53:49,548
- Well, you shouldn't have done that.
- It's all my fault.

750
00:53:49,750 --> 00:53:52,219
I guess I'm sort of a
misfit. I was gonna leave.

751
00:53:52,420 --> 00:53:54,217
But the gang and Joe had cash...

752
00:53:54,422 --> 00:53:56,947
That's enough hearts and
flowers. Let's go back to work.

753
00:53:57,159 --> 00:53:59,627
Wait. Wait a minute. Mr. Ross.

754
00:53:59,862 --> 00:54:02,057
I can't accept this.

755
00:54:02,264 --> 00:54:04,631
Oh, I'm afraid you're stuck with it.

756
00:54:04,868 --> 00:54:06,664
What are we gonna do with a tractor?

757
00:54:06,902 --> 00:54:12,466
Well, I know much they cost.
I know that you could...

758
00:54:15,145 --> 00:54:18,912
Wasrt your station wagon
parked over there last night?

759
00:54:19,116 --> 00:54:22,482
Look, the way I see it,
the farm needs a tractor.

760
00:54:22,686 --> 00:54:26,453
Me, I don't need a station wagon. It
got us up here, that's all that matters.

761
00:54:26,657 --> 00:54:29,023
When the show's a hit, I'll
buy two to bring us back.

762
00:54:29,260 --> 00:54:32,525
Joe, the truck's here with the
costumes and lights. What do we do?

763
00:54:32,798 --> 00:54:34,629
What do we do?

764
00:54:35,033 --> 00:54:38,195
Oh, the chores can
wait. Unload the trucks.

765
00:54:38,769 --> 00:54:41,295
- Okay, Herb.
- Solid.

766
00:54:41,607 --> 00:54:43,268
Okay, gang, unload the truck.

767
00:54:43,475 --> 00:54:45,033
You know...

768
00:54:46,612 --> 00:54:49,047
Be careful with the
lights. Put the props there.

769
00:54:55,321 --> 00:54:58,313
Don't be too disappointed.
I'm glad it's over.

770
00:54:58,524 --> 00:55:01,357
I was getting awful tired
sleeping up there in that hayloft.

771
00:55:01,562 --> 00:55:03,996
You'd better get used to
it, Es. They're staying.

772
00:55:04,198 --> 00:55:06,689
- Staying?
- Oh, Jane, you won't be sorry.

773
00:55:06,967 --> 00:55:09,198
They'll eat us out of house and home.

774
00:55:09,470 --> 00:55:10,698
I'll get your dinner now.

775
00:55:12,640 --> 00:55:13,971
Good morning, Jane.

776
00:55:14,174 --> 00:55:17,201
- Oh, Orville, how are you?
- Good morning, Orville.

777
00:55:17,979 --> 00:55:19,947
- I'd like to apo...
- I'd like to apo...

778
00:55:20,148 --> 00:55:21,479
- Orville, I'm...
- Jane, I'm...

779
00:55:21,683 --> 00:55:23,879
- I'm sorry, didn't mean...
- I knew you would be.

780
00:55:24,086 --> 00:55:25,552
It got out of hand.

781
00:55:25,754 --> 00:55:29,053
When you make a promise to Father,
it's a good idea to keep the promise.

782
00:55:29,257 --> 00:55:31,089
I didn't intentionally
break the promise...

783
00:55:31,260 --> 00:55:33,592
He gave an expensive
tractor. And when he gives...

784
00:55:33,829 --> 00:55:36,229
- He didn't give me the tractor.
- I know. I was there.

785
00:55:36,399 --> 00:55:37,560
It was a business deal.

786
00:55:37,734 --> 00:55:39,395
- I'll pay for the tractor.
- I know.

787
00:55:39,569 --> 00:55:41,866
- I didn't...
- I'm tired of hearing about the tractor.

788
00:55:42,071 --> 00:55:44,266
- But, Jane...
- Did your father send you here?

789
00:55:44,508 --> 00:55:46,976
- He doesn't know I'm here.
- You better tell him.

790
00:55:47,177 --> 00:55:50,044
Tell him he can have that
tractor back anytime he wants.

791
00:55:50,247 --> 00:55:52,580
- But, Jane, he...
- Excuse me.

792
00:55:52,784 --> 00:55:55,184
I said we were sorry.

793
00:55:56,554 --> 00:55:58,852
I apologized.

794
00:55:59,490 --> 00:56:03,256
You don't know the first thing
about women. You never did.

795
00:56:03,494 --> 00:56:06,623
I remember in school. Lots
of girls had crushes on you.

796
00:56:06,865 --> 00:56:11,495
So did I. But you just didn't
know what to do about them.

797
00:56:11,704 --> 00:56:15,731
Orville, a woman doesn't want
apologies. She wants romance, excitement.

798
00:56:15,941 --> 00:56:19,604
- She wants to be swept off her feet.
- That's only in big cities.

799
00:56:19,812 --> 00:56:25,649
Oh, no, it isn't. Orville, you
have to be strong, forceful.

800
00:56:26,519 --> 00:56:30,455
A woman doesn't want to be
asked. She wants to be told.

801
00:56:30,657 --> 00:56:35,095
Maybe you're right. I'll
speak to Father about it.

802
00:56:35,296 --> 00:56:39,062
Thanks, Abigail. You're very nice.

803
00:56:40,034 --> 00:56:42,970
- Here.
- Thank you.

804
00:56:43,171 --> 00:56:47,334
- Give those to Jane, will you?
- Yes, I will.

805
00:56:53,106 --> 00:56:54,835
You're very nice.

806
00:57:09,657 --> 00:57:12,991
Hey, kids, kids. Hey. Pay
attention to me. Listen, kids.

807
00:57:13,195 --> 00:57:17,154
There'll be a run-through tonight at
7:30. Seven-thirty sharp. Look alive.

808
00:57:17,367 --> 00:57:20,426
- Alive? We're half-dead. -
Look half-dead. But be there.

809
00:57:20,636 --> 00:57:24,767
- Hey, who's this one for? The chickens?
- Chickens. Hey, that's funny.

810
00:57:25,442 --> 00:57:27,103
The chickens.

811
00:57:54,206 --> 00:57:56,037
How do you like it?

812
00:57:58,243 --> 00:58:00,074
Well, I don't...

813
00:58:00,413 --> 00:58:03,314
I don't know much about all of this.

814
00:58:03,516 --> 00:58:08,419
But with the lights and
all, it's kind of exciting.

815
00:58:08,655 --> 00:58:10,987
Exciting? Yeah.

816
00:58:11,925 --> 00:58:14,223
But wait till opening night
when the people come in.

817
00:58:14,394 --> 00:58:16,488
Even the air gets exciting.

818
00:58:17,164 --> 00:58:18,859
You can feel them out there.

819
00:58:19,066 --> 00:58:21,865
You can't see them
but you can feel them.

820
00:58:22,070 --> 00:58:24,264
It's like electricity.

821
00:58:25,139 --> 00:58:26,731
Oh, boy.

822
00:58:28,275 --> 00:58:32,576
- You really love this, don't you?
- What, show business?

823
00:58:32,781 --> 00:58:34,749
There's nothing else in the world.

824
00:58:34,950 --> 00:58:39,182
If I couldn't be up here, I'd
work backstage or sell tickets.

825
00:58:39,387 --> 00:58:40,820
Why?

826
00:58:41,089 --> 00:58:42,454
Why?

827
00:58:42,691 --> 00:58:46,287
Oh, a lot of reasons.

828
00:58:46,762 --> 00:58:48,525
Here's one.

829
00:58:50,199 --> 00:58:52,794
Now, look, close your eyes.

830
00:58:53,804 --> 00:58:55,566
Take a whiff of that.

831
00:58:56,305 --> 00:58:57,933
You like it?

832
00:58:59,109 --> 00:59:02,272
- Yes, I think I do.
- Sure you do. It's greasepaint.

833
00:59:02,980 --> 00:59:04,676
Go easy. That's very potent stuff.

834
00:59:04,882 --> 00:59:07,908
You smell it once too often, it
gets away down deep inside you.

835
00:59:08,119 --> 00:59:10,178
You can wipe it off
your face, all right.

836
00:59:10,388 --> 00:59:12,754
But you'll never get
it out of your blood.

837
00:59:13,725 --> 00:59:18,287
No, it's the same old stuff, but that's
one of the reasons I love the theater.

838
00:59:18,496 --> 00:59:21,193
And everything it stands for.

839
00:59:21,567 --> 00:59:24,229
The heartaches, the
excitement, the applause...

840
00:59:24,436 --> 00:59:26,769
...the lights, the hokum, everything.

841
00:59:26,973 --> 00:59:32,274
- Hokum? What's hokum?
- Hokum? Well, hokum's comedy.

842
00:59:32,478 --> 00:59:37,212
Well, no, it isn't either,
exactly. Well, it's hard to explain.

843
00:59:37,417 --> 00:59:40,352
The word itself comes from
the old vaudeville days.

844
00:59:40,588 --> 00:59:44,421
Two comics would come out on stage
and one would say to the other:

845
00:59:44,624 --> 00:59:47,753
"How come I seen you at the
party last night stealing spoons?"

846
00:59:47,962 --> 00:59:49,953
The other would say, "Doctor's orders.

847
00:59:50,164 --> 00:59:53,691
The doctor says, 'Here's your medicine,
take two spoons after each meal. '

848
00:59:53,868 --> 00:59:55,302
That's how come. "

849
00:59:55,470 --> 00:59:59,269
They were called "how come"
jokes. "How come. " Hokum. See?

850
01:00:00,775 --> 01:00:03,939
You don't have that kind of
"how come" in this show, do you?

851
01:00:04,146 --> 01:00:06,876
Well, we better not have. No, no.

852
01:00:07,115 --> 01:00:12,782
No, we're trying to tell a story
with music and song and dance and...

853
01:00:12,989 --> 01:00:15,287
Well, not just with words.

854
01:00:15,490 --> 01:00:20,519
For instance, if the boy tells the girl
that he loves her, he just doesn't say it.

855
01:00:20,763 --> 01:00:24,825
- He sings it.
- Well, why doesn't he just say it?

856
01:00:25,035 --> 01:00:26,627
Why?

857
01:00:27,004 --> 01:00:31,805
Oh, I don't know,
but it's kind of nice.

858
01:00:32,342 --> 01:00:33,673
Look, let me show you.

859
01:00:35,412 --> 01:00:40,214
Now, you're the girl and
I'm the boy. Oh, here.

860
01:00:40,852 --> 01:00:43,787
When the curtain goes
up, you're sitting here.

861
01:00:44,322 --> 01:00:45,813
Yeah. Yeah.

862
01:00:46,025 --> 01:00:49,926
I'm in love with you and I tell you.

863
01:00:50,395 --> 01:00:55,925
I'm glad I met you

864
01:00:56,168 --> 01:01:01,129
You wonderful you

865
01:01:01,842 --> 01:01:07,337
I can't forget you

866
01:01:07,547 --> 01:01:12,109
You wonderful you

867
01:01:13,420 --> 01:01:17,915
You're like a breath of spring

868
01:01:18,126 --> 01:01:24,122
A whole new thing has happened

869
01:01:24,465 --> 01:01:28,926
And without much ado

870
01:01:29,138 --> 01:01:33,131
I look at you and

871
01:01:34,343 --> 01:01:36,903
There stands love

872
01:01:37,379 --> 01:01:42,579
My arms around you

873
01:01:42,785 --> 01:01:47,620
That's wonderful too

874
01:01:47,857 --> 01:01:52,658
So glad I found you

875
01:01:52,896 --> 01:01:57,664
You wonderful you

876
01:01:58,002 --> 01:02:02,132
Remember, finders keepers

877
01:02:02,373 --> 01:02:05,400
Losers weepers

878
01:02:05,610 --> 01:02:08,772
And because it's true

879
01:02:08,979 --> 01:02:13,144
You're mine now

880
01:02:13,385 --> 01:02:17,014
You wonderful you

881
01:02:17,455 --> 01:02:20,357
- I like that.
- And then they dance.

882
01:02:21,661 --> 01:02:25,995
A nice, easy dance.
It's a nice, easy song.

883
01:02:37,344 --> 01:02:40,905
You're like a breath of spring

884
01:02:41,415 --> 01:02:45,317
A whole new thing has happened

885
01:02:46,955 --> 01:02:50,721
And without much ado

886
01:02:50,959 --> 01:02:54,088
I look at you and

887
01:02:54,997 --> 01:02:57,464
There stands love

888
01:02:57,665 --> 01:03:02,365
My arms around you

889
01:03:02,571 --> 01:03:06,439
That's wonderful too

890
01:03:07,042 --> 01:03:11,571
So glad I found you

891
01:03:11,815 --> 01:03:16,514
You wonderful you

892
01:03:16,720 --> 01:03:21,783
Remember, finders keepers

893
01:03:22,827 --> 01:03:24,385
Losers weepers

894
01:03:24,595 --> 01:03:28,031
- And because it's true
- And because it's true

895
01:03:28,232 --> 01:03:33,226
- You're mine now
- You're mine now

896
01:03:34,105 --> 01:03:40,841
You wonderful you

897
01:04:03,102 --> 01:04:05,002
Good evening, Jane.

898
01:04:08,008 --> 01:04:09,999
- Mr. Wingait.
- We came over this evening...

899
01:04:10,210 --> 01:04:12,736
...because Orville has
something to say to you.

900
01:04:14,916 --> 01:04:17,440
- Hello, Orville.
- Evening, Jane.

901
01:04:17,718 --> 01:04:24,283
- Oh, Jane, may we sit down?
- Oh, yes. I'm sorry. Please.

902
01:04:25,393 --> 01:04:28,921
Jane, Dad was thinking... I
mean, I was thinking that...

903
01:04:29,131 --> 01:04:31,429
- Orville is going to be very frank.
- Frank.

904
01:04:31,634 --> 01:04:35,092
He can't see why you invited these
people here or permit them to stay.

905
01:04:35,304 --> 01:04:36,896
- He didn't come about that.
- No.

906
01:04:37,106 --> 01:04:40,075
- Well, go on. Go on.
- Jane, Dad feels, I mean, I feel...

907
01:04:40,276 --> 01:04:42,472
He feels you should have
a definite understanding.

908
01:04:42,679 --> 01:04:44,909
He's been very patient
the last four years, Jane.

909
01:04:45,115 --> 01:04:48,608
- You can't expect a man to wait forever.
- No, you can't.

910
01:04:49,319 --> 01:04:52,982
- You mean, you want me to set a date?
- Yes.

911
01:04:53,190 --> 01:04:56,592
Yes. It's not only for his sake.
Orville's greatly worried about you.

912
01:04:56,794 --> 01:04:58,455
He didn't sleep a wink last night.

913
01:04:58,663 --> 01:05:00,961
Didrt you walk the floors
until morning thinking?

914
01:05:01,165 --> 01:05:03,794
- I'm sorry.
- Well, Jane?

915
01:05:05,803 --> 01:05:07,361
Orville.

916
01:05:10,209 --> 01:05:14,771
When these people leave, I'd
be very happy to marry you.

917
01:05:14,980 --> 01:05:16,812
- Congratulations.
- That's wonderful.

918
01:05:16,983 --> 01:05:18,575
- Congratulations.
- Wonderful.

919
01:05:18,785 --> 01:05:20,616
- Give it to her.
- I've got it, Jane.

920
01:05:20,787 --> 01:05:22,879
- I've got something that I...
- Go on. Hurry.

921
01:05:23,122 --> 01:05:25,648
- Where'd you put it? Here.
- I think it's in my pants...

922
01:05:25,825 --> 01:05:27,816
Oh, here. Here. What's
the matter with you?

923
01:05:28,027 --> 01:05:31,020
Here you are, Jane. Here you are.

924
01:05:31,232 --> 01:05:34,030
- Oh, Mr. Wingait.
- Been in the family for generations.

925
01:05:34,235 --> 01:05:36,226
Oh, my, it's lovely. Thank you.

926
01:05:36,470 --> 01:05:38,734
The Falburys and the Wingaits.

927
01:05:42,476 --> 01:05:45,138
Well, come on, son. It's getting late.

928
01:05:48,350 --> 01:05:50,011
Good night, Janie.

929
01:05:50,218 --> 01:05:51,617
Good night, Mr. Wingait.

930
01:05:51,820 --> 01:05:54,516
Good night, "daughter. "

931
01:05:55,657 --> 01:05:58,820
Good night, dear.

932
01:05:59,394 --> 01:06:01,192
Well, come on!

933
01:06:02,932 --> 01:06:05,196
When young'uns can't
make up their own minds...

934
01:06:05,368 --> 01:06:09,328
...it's up to an old codger like me
to make it up for them, eh, Janie?

935
01:06:09,939 --> 01:06:12,840
Fine for Niagara Falls
this time of year, son.

936
01:06:13,042 --> 01:06:14,874
Mighty pretty up there.

937
01:06:15,078 --> 01:06:17,205
Night, Janie.

938
01:06:18,849 --> 01:06:21,044
See you in church.

939
01:06:32,096 --> 01:06:36,056
There's a star for everyone

940
01:06:36,268 --> 01:06:40,204
Brightly shining in the sky

941
01:06:40,406 --> 01:06:47,710
It seems to be a part of our destiny

942
01:06:50,083 --> 01:06:54,315
Every night I eagerly

943
01:06:54,554 --> 01:06:59,253
Watch them all go twinkling by

944
01:06:59,826 --> 01:07:04,890
But I can't seem to find

945
01:07:05,099 --> 01:07:10,935
The one the heavens assigned

946
01:07:11,138 --> 01:07:16,235
To me

947
01:07:19,481 --> 01:07:25,442
Friendly star

948
01:07:25,655 --> 01:07:30,091
Where can you be hiding

949
01:07:30,292 --> 01:07:38,325
Smile for me from out
of the lonely night

950
01:07:41,739 --> 01:07:46,972
Friendly star

951
01:07:47,478 --> 01:07:51,847
My fate needs deciding

952
01:07:52,182 --> 01:08:01,320
How I need the glow
of your guiding light

953
01:08:01,861 --> 01:08:10,132
I know that you are near

954
01:08:10,303 --> 01:08:15,708
For I am strangely dreamy

955
01:08:15,909 --> 01:08:24,078
And so if you can see me from afar

956
01:08:24,685 --> 01:08:31,990
Wort you kindly

957
01:08:32,560 --> 01:08:36,859
Light my way

958
01:08:37,398 --> 01:08:42,233
Lead me to my lover

959
01:08:42,437 --> 01:08:48,001
Just point him out and whisper

960
01:08:48,210 --> 01:08:52,943
"There you are

961
01:08:53,182 --> 01:08:57,482
There you are"

962
01:08:58,087 --> 01:09:04,516
Then my love, you will be

963
01:09:04,995 --> 01:09:11,730
Standing here, close to me

964
01:09:11,968 --> 01:09:15,370
In your eyes

965
01:09:15,573 --> 01:09:23,639
I will see my friendly

966
01:09:24,348 --> 01:09:32,154
Star

967
01:09:38,797 --> 01:09:40,628
That was nice.

968
01:09:44,303 --> 01:09:45,827
You...

969
01:09:46,105 --> 01:09:47,663
You and...

970
01:09:48,742 --> 01:09:50,573
You set a date?

971
01:09:51,145 --> 01:09:53,170
It'll be soon.

972
01:09:57,751 --> 01:10:00,982
Well, that's fine. Fine.

973
01:10:01,188 --> 01:10:03,783
I think it's a good idea.

974
01:10:05,026 --> 01:10:08,587
Anyway, what I came to
talk to you about, I...

975
01:10:08,830 --> 01:10:10,560
Well, you know that...

976
01:10:11,199 --> 01:10:12,632
Down in the barn, I...

977
01:10:12,834 --> 01:10:15,462
Well, don't worry about that.
That didn't mean anything.

978
01:10:15,670 --> 01:10:17,468
Oh, I know.

979
01:10:17,673 --> 01:10:22,474
I showed you a number.
We sang. We danced.

980
01:10:22,678 --> 01:10:26,137
- You're a very good dancer.
- Thanks.

981
01:10:26,349 --> 01:10:29,408
But nothing happened.
That is, nothing important.

982
01:10:30,953 --> 01:10:34,822
So it's certainly no reason
for rushing into a marriage.

983
01:10:37,294 --> 01:10:39,855
We're not exactly rushing.

984
01:10:40,965 --> 01:10:43,489
No, you've been engaged.

985
01:10:44,301 --> 01:10:48,363
- Four years.
- I know. Well, I...

986
01:10:49,340 --> 01:10:53,675
I just wanted to tell you. I
didn't want you to worry about...

987
01:10:56,715 --> 01:11:00,013
No, no.

988
01:11:00,486 --> 01:11:04,047
It was like... Well, you know, like...

989
01:11:04,857 --> 01:11:08,521
...you're walking across a
field and everything's great.

990
01:11:08,728 --> 01:11:12,494
The surs shining and
birds are singing...

991
01:11:12,966 --> 01:11:17,733
...and all of a sudden out of a clear
sky, a bolt of lighting hits you.

992
01:11:19,906 --> 01:11:21,966
It's not your fault.

993
01:11:24,378 --> 01:11:27,506
But you don't have to
walk in the field again.

994
01:11:27,882 --> 01:11:29,475
No.

995
01:11:39,194 --> 01:11:41,059
Good night, Jane.

996
01:11:43,432 --> 01:11:45,400
Good night.

997
01:12:07,391 --> 01:12:09,825
I love this farm.

998
01:12:10,060 --> 01:12:12,791
You know, I was all over
the south pasture yesterday.

999
01:12:13,031 --> 01:12:16,398
The acid constituent
is too high, by far.

1000
01:12:16,601 --> 01:12:19,798
You see, that's due to
the lack of silicic itself.

1001
01:12:20,071 --> 01:12:24,269
After we're married, I intend to make
regular applications of calcium...

1002
01:12:24,442 --> 01:12:27,037
...magnesium and...

1003
01:12:27,813 --> 01:12:29,405
Jane?

1004
01:12:29,682 --> 01:12:31,673
- What?
- You seem more interested...

1005
01:12:31,917 --> 01:12:33,909
...in that show than you are in me.

1006
01:12:34,788 --> 01:12:36,846
I'm sorry, Orville.

1007
01:12:38,290 --> 01:12:42,557
It's gonna seem rather strange,
having an actress for a sister-in-law.

1008
01:12:43,196 --> 01:12:46,757
Abigail. Rather uncomfortable.

1009
01:12:47,000 --> 01:12:51,062
Come to think of it, that Ross
fellow will be my brother-in-law.

1010
01:12:52,639 --> 01:12:53,970
Well...

1011
01:12:55,309 --> 01:13:01,339
...we won't see much of them.
They'll be living in New York.

1012
01:13:02,284 --> 01:13:06,653
You know, a couple of weeks ago, I was
actually jealous of that Ross fellow.

1013
01:13:07,356 --> 01:13:09,517
Just a little silly idea I had.

1014
01:13:09,725 --> 01:13:12,455
Before I knew about him and Abigail.

1015
01:13:13,195 --> 01:13:16,131
What does she see in
a fellow like that?

1016
01:13:16,966 --> 01:13:18,399
Well...

1017
01:13:19,002 --> 01:13:22,301
...love's a funny thing.

1018
01:13:23,807 --> 01:13:29,039
You never know where the
lightning's going to strike.

1019
01:13:29,312 --> 01:13:30,905
That's right.

1020
01:13:31,815 --> 01:13:34,113
Look how it struck us.

1021
01:13:43,360 --> 01:13:48,697
Drifting on the bay
of Can't Forget You

1022
01:13:49,868 --> 01:13:57,172
Moonbeams will relight
The night I met you

1023
01:13:58,376 --> 01:14:00,038
I'll know then...

1024
01:14:00,212 --> 01:14:03,841
All right, kids, hold it. Hold it. It's
still dragging. We gotta pick it up.

1025
01:14:04,016 --> 01:14:05,950
Try it again. Pretty good, Abby.

1026
01:14:06,186 --> 01:14:08,381
Oh, Joe, not again.
I've been going all day.

1027
01:14:08,588 --> 01:14:10,886
We all have, honey. All
right, Artie, from the top.

1028
01:14:11,091 --> 01:14:13,285
I told you I don't want
to do it again. I'm tired.

1029
01:14:13,460 --> 01:14:15,724
Look, we gotta do it
again. Now, take it easy.

1030
01:14:15,896 --> 01:14:17,261
Just run through it easy.

1031
01:14:17,464 --> 01:14:19,694
- I don't think we have to.
- You don't think?

1032
01:14:19,900 --> 01:14:22,665
- No, I don't think we have to.
- Just a minute. Just...

1033
01:14:22,870 --> 01:14:25,737
- You have no right to work us like this.
- Nobody is complaining.

1034
01:14:25,940 --> 01:14:28,966
- The number's fine the way it is.
- I'll decide that, not you.

1035
01:14:29,210 --> 01:14:32,373
Your job is to do what I tell you
and to do it right for a change.

1036
01:14:32,580 --> 01:14:34,707
You know, you're not
so perfect in this part.

1037
01:14:34,917 --> 01:14:37,579
- What?
- No. Your timing's off, you miss your cues.

1038
01:14:37,753 --> 01:14:40,722
You don't know your lines.
Don't act like a prima donna.

1039
01:14:40,923 --> 01:14:43,722
Well, if I'm so awful, why
didn't you get somebody else?

1040
01:14:44,294 --> 01:14:46,818
If I'd known this was
gonna happen, I would have.

1041
01:14:47,062 --> 01:14:49,190
You know your trouble?
You got a star complex.

1042
01:14:49,366 --> 01:14:51,334
You think you're the
whole show. You're not.

1043
01:14:51,501 --> 01:14:53,093
The sooner you find out, the better.

1044
01:14:53,303 --> 01:14:57,434
Listen, you're gonna buckle down
and get to work like everybody else.

1045
01:14:57,641 --> 01:15:00,166
You're gonna play this part,
play it the way I want it...

1046
01:15:00,344 --> 01:15:04,405
...if I have to drag a performance
out of you with my two hands!

1047
01:15:05,916 --> 01:15:08,111
Okay, kids. Break it
up. Same time tomorrow.

1048
01:15:08,586 --> 01:15:10,714
That means everybody
here ready to work.

1049
01:15:10,922 --> 01:15:12,412
Good night.

1050
01:15:13,158 --> 01:15:16,491
Now, now, my dear, you mustrt
let these things upset you.

1051
01:15:16,728 --> 01:15:20,789
- He didn't have to talk to me like that.
- After all, my dear, this is hardly theater.

1052
01:15:20,999 --> 01:15:23,729
It's just a little
barnyard entertainment.

1053
01:15:23,935 --> 01:15:27,133
Don't you worry, someday they'll
treat you the way you deserve.

1054
01:15:27,340 --> 01:15:29,865
I'll see to that personally.

1055
01:15:30,610 --> 01:15:33,602
- I had a call from New York this morning.
- Oh, Harrison, what?

1056
01:15:33,813 --> 01:15:35,303
Something very interesting.

1057
01:15:35,515 --> 01:15:37,039
- Good night, Joe.
- Good night, Joe.

1058
01:15:37,283 --> 01:15:39,309
- Let's go make some coffee.
- I sure need it.

1059
01:15:42,656 --> 01:15:44,351
Good night, Joe.

1060
01:15:44,558 --> 01:15:46,823
Was that necessary?

1061
01:15:47,062 --> 01:15:48,962
Oh, hello, Jane.

1062
01:15:49,163 --> 01:15:52,155
Yeah, yeah, I'm afraid it was.
Abigail's been acting up a little.

1063
01:15:52,366 --> 01:15:55,461
It seems to me you were trying
to hurt her. Deliberately.

1064
01:15:55,670 --> 01:15:59,037
It will do her some good. We
might get a rehearsal out of her.

1065
01:15:59,307 --> 01:16:04,336
You mean you have to browbeat someone
to get a rehearsal out of them?

1066
01:16:04,547 --> 01:16:07,379
- It happens in this business.
- You ought to make a change...

1067
01:16:07,549 --> 01:16:09,541
...in this business.

1068
01:16:09,785 --> 01:16:12,083
Don't do that to the
girl you're gonna marry.

1069
01:16:12,321 --> 01:16:14,721
Jane, this has nothing to
do with getting married.

1070
01:16:14,890 --> 01:16:18,019
- What?
- No, it's all part of putting on a show.

1071
01:16:18,228 --> 01:16:21,197
Now, look, I don't tell
you how to run your farm.

1072
01:16:21,397 --> 01:16:24,231
Believe me, in my work, I
know what's gotta be done.

1073
01:16:24,434 --> 01:16:27,528
All I know is what
you've done to my sister.

1074
01:16:27,737 --> 01:16:32,198
And as long as you happen
to be using this barn...

1075
01:16:37,882 --> 01:16:42,546
Okay. I'll handle her with kid gloves.

1076
01:16:42,854 --> 01:16:45,187
If it'll make you happy.

1077
01:16:45,891 --> 01:16:48,951
It'll make her happy and
that's all that counts.

1078
01:16:58,905 --> 01:17:01,373
- Oh, Artie.
- Yeah, Joe?

1079
01:17:01,574 --> 01:17:04,566
- Let everything go, I'll close up.
- Oh, okay. Good night, Joe.

1080
01:17:04,777 --> 01:17:06,370
Good night.

1081
01:22:09,272 --> 01:22:10,864
- What's my next line?
- Okay, Abby.

1082
01:22:11,041 --> 01:22:12,565
- I didn't want to hold him.
- Abby.

1083
01:22:12,777 --> 01:22:15,302
All right. Hold it, hold
it, hold it. Where's Abby?

1084
01:22:15,545 --> 01:22:17,740
- He's free to go.
- I didn't want to hold him.

1085
01:22:17,948 --> 01:22:21,112
- Abby.
- He's free to go. What's the matter?

1086
01:22:21,319 --> 01:22:23,583
Abby, we're waiting for
you. That was your cue.

1087
01:22:23,788 --> 01:22:26,985
I'll never make that, even if I
change in the wings. It's impossible.

1088
01:22:27,192 --> 01:22:29,285
Okay. Okay. That's what
run-throughs are for.

1089
01:22:29,495 --> 01:22:31,190
We'll shuffle things around a bit.

1090
01:22:31,396 --> 01:22:35,332
- Sarah can take the number. Sarah?
- Just a minute. Just a minute.

1091
01:22:35,601 --> 01:22:38,900
This is my number. Nobody
else is going to do it.

1092
01:22:39,471 --> 01:22:40,802
What do you suggest?

1093
01:22:41,006 --> 01:22:44,602
I suggest you don't try
cutting anything of mine.

1094
01:22:44,811 --> 01:22:47,006
If you had the show
properly routined...

1095
01:22:47,213 --> 01:22:49,738
...you wouldn't expect
people to do the impossible.

1096
01:22:49,949 --> 01:22:53,316
As the matter of fact, I think
this whole thing is unprofessional.

1097
01:22:53,520 --> 01:22:58,254
Obviously, this isn't a Broadway show,
it's just a little barnyard entertainment.

1098
01:23:04,431 --> 01:23:05,728
Well?

1099
01:23:06,033 --> 01:23:08,934
I'm still trying to
do things your way.

1100
01:23:09,770 --> 01:23:12,137
I'll talk to her.

1101
01:23:15,477 --> 01:23:18,140
And while I think of it,
don't forget ambers on Abby.

1102
01:23:18,314 --> 01:23:19,940
- I don't want a dark stage.
- Okay.

1103
01:23:20,148 --> 01:23:21,547
- Coffee?
- Yeah.

1104
01:23:21,783 --> 01:23:25,015
- Where is Abby? Isn't she up?
- Es has gone to get her.

1105
01:23:25,221 --> 01:23:28,190
Wow! Hey kids, we're in Variety.

1106
01:23:28,391 --> 01:23:32,351
Get a load of this. "Word along the
stem is that Joe Ross' new musical...

1107
01:23:32,529 --> 01:23:35,464
...Fall in Love, looks like
a real buy. Six producers...

1108
01:23:35,632 --> 01:23:39,796
...will be trekking to his barnyard
theater next week for their first glimpse. "

1109
01:23:40,070 --> 01:23:42,334
- We're in.
- Read that part again, Herb?

1110
01:23:43,574 --> 01:23:47,375
"Word along the stem is
that Joe Ross' new musical...

1111
01:23:47,545 --> 01:23:50,673
...Fall in Love, looks
like a real buy. "

1112
01:23:52,716 --> 01:23:54,810
What is it, Jane?

1113
01:23:58,289 --> 01:24:00,281
"... am leaving for
New York with Mr. Keath.

1114
01:24:00,492 --> 01:24:02,551
He's got a part for
me in his new play.

1115
01:24:02,795 --> 01:24:05,389
Please understand,
this is my big chance. "

1116
01:24:09,902 --> 01:24:13,702
I just thought of a wonderful idea.
That stage wait in the second act?

1117
01:24:13,906 --> 01:24:17,570
It doesn't have to be. All you have
to do is lift the curtain just...

1118
01:24:17,811 --> 01:24:19,904
- Who died?
- The show died.

1119
01:24:20,113 --> 01:24:22,173
- What?
- Abigail walked out on us.

1120
01:24:22,383 --> 01:24:23,714
- What?
- With Keath.

1121
01:24:23,918 --> 01:24:26,249
- With Keath?
- Oh, I don't care about him.

1122
01:24:26,419 --> 01:24:28,854
I can get along without him.
I can do his part myself.

1123
01:24:29,056 --> 01:24:31,957
- Without Abigail, I'm sunk.
- What about the girl in New York?

1124
01:24:32,126 --> 01:24:35,357
I don't understand why
she'd do a thing like this.

1125
01:24:35,529 --> 01:24:38,761
- Some of them sing, some dance.
- Go to New York with Mr. Keath?

1126
01:24:38,967 --> 01:24:41,457
- I don't know Mr. Keath.
- It's tough to get a girl...

1127
01:24:41,636 --> 01:24:43,229
She didn't leave me an address.

1128
01:24:43,405 --> 01:24:45,703
These kind of girls
don't grow on trees.

1129
01:24:46,441 --> 01:24:48,932
She didn't even say goodbye to me.

1130
01:24:50,413 --> 01:24:52,142
You think it'll work?

1131
01:24:52,382 --> 01:24:54,282
- Maybe.
- Joe, we only got three days.

1132
01:24:54,450 --> 01:24:55,781
- I know.
- Got the numbers.

1133
01:24:55,952 --> 01:24:58,045
- Gotta rehearse...
- I know. What else?

1134
01:24:58,254 --> 01:25:00,654
- We can try.
- What else are we gonna do?

1135
01:25:00,890 --> 01:25:02,551
I don't know.

1136
01:25:03,993 --> 01:25:05,859
Jane?

1137
01:25:07,131 --> 01:25:08,962
- What?
- Jane...

1138
01:25:09,166 --> 01:25:11,863
...you're gonna do the part.
- You're gonna do the part.

1139
01:25:12,070 --> 01:25:14,594
- Don't get excited.
- I'm not excited. I'm not...

1140
01:25:14,805 --> 01:25:17,603
You can sing. You can
dance. And you know the part.

1141
01:25:17,808 --> 01:25:20,107
- I couldn't do that.
- You're a girl in 100,000.

1142
01:25:20,278 --> 01:25:22,838
- No.
- Take it from me. I know you can.

1143
01:25:23,014 --> 01:25:24,641
- No, no.
- Listen to him.

1144
01:25:24,816 --> 01:25:26,114
- You can do that part.
- Listen to him.

1145
01:25:27,820 --> 01:25:30,788
Again. Again.

1146
01:25:30,955 --> 01:25:32,923
That's right, turn.

1147
01:25:39,198 --> 01:25:41,895
Come on, get in now. That's it.

1148
01:25:42,703 --> 01:25:44,761
- Gosh, I can't...
- Come on.

1149
01:25:47,339 --> 01:25:48,932
- That's right.
- I'll never get it.

1150
01:25:49,109 --> 01:25:50,633
No, look, baby...

1151
01:26:01,789 --> 01:26:03,780
Come on now.

1152
01:26:03,991 --> 01:26:05,583
That's it.

1153
01:26:10,966 --> 01:26:12,695
All right, hold it. That's too slow.

1154
01:26:12,868 --> 01:26:15,837
- We gotta do it a lot faster.
- I've done that entrance 20 times.

1155
01:26:16,039 --> 01:26:18,802
So we'll do it 40, 50,
100 times and do it right.

1156
01:26:18,974 --> 01:26:21,169
- All right, all right.
- Jane.

1157
01:26:21,376 --> 01:26:23,743
- Oh, Orville.
- What are you doing up there?

1158
01:26:25,081 --> 01:26:27,982
Well, I'm making an entrance.
Forty, 50, a lot of times.

1159
01:26:28,184 --> 01:26:30,585
What in the world is going on here?

1160
01:26:31,689 --> 01:26:33,679
Orville, I'll tell you about it later.

1161
01:26:34,023 --> 01:26:36,719
Well, I demand to know
right here and now.

1162
01:26:37,060 --> 01:26:41,157
Orville, this is none of
your affair. Just go away.

1163
01:26:42,366 --> 01:26:45,393
I will not go away, you come
down from that stage immediately.

1164
01:26:45,570 --> 01:26:47,197
Come on, come on.

1165
01:26:47,606 --> 01:26:51,906
Orville, I've got enough
trouble. Don't you start in on me.

1166
01:26:52,110 --> 01:26:55,739
I've only got two days to get up in
this part. This is no time to argue.

1167
01:26:57,349 --> 01:27:00,251
You're not in this show?

1168
01:27:00,486 --> 01:27:04,422
- You're not.
- I just told you. Yes, I am!

1169
01:27:04,791 --> 01:27:06,122
Why, I won't have it.

1170
01:27:06,359 --> 01:27:09,021
I won't have a fiancée
of mine working in a...

1171
01:27:09,228 --> 01:27:12,391
Orville, if you don't stop
this, you won't have a fiancée.

1172
01:27:12,598 --> 01:27:15,796
So just sit down and be quiet.
If you can't be quiet, leave.

1173
01:27:17,871 --> 01:27:20,271
- Now, look here.
- All right.

1174
01:27:20,508 --> 01:27:23,635
Go away. Go home.

1175
01:27:24,077 --> 01:27:27,240
- What do we do now?
- We'll rehearse that entrance.

1176
01:27:27,582 --> 01:27:29,516
All right.

1177
01:27:36,258 --> 01:27:37,884
What kind of a man are you, anyway?

1178
01:27:38,092 --> 01:27:40,287
Your fiancée mixed up
with a theatrical show...

1179
01:27:40,528 --> 01:27:42,258
...and you not stopping it.

1180
01:27:42,464 --> 01:27:46,264
You call yourself a Wingait? You
ought to be ashamed to use the name.

1181
01:27:46,468 --> 01:27:48,732
- A sniveling, helpless...
- Shut up.

1182
01:27:48,938 --> 01:27:51,806
- What did you say?
- I said shut up!

1183
01:27:52,042 --> 01:27:54,305
Well, that's a fine way
to speak to your father.

1184
01:27:54,543 --> 01:27:58,480
You've been talking that way to
me for 27 years and I'm sick of it.

1185
01:27:58,682 --> 01:28:00,912
I'll prove whether
I'm a Wingait or not.

1186
01:28:01,117 --> 01:28:04,610
I'll stop that show if
it's the last thing I do.

1187
01:28:04,822 --> 01:28:07,450
And I'll do it without
your advice or your help.

1188
01:28:07,658 --> 01:28:13,187
And hereafter, when you talk to
me, keep your voice down! Look out!

1189
01:28:31,116 --> 01:28:33,813
Good, good, good. All
right, that's swell.

1190
01:28:34,020 --> 01:28:36,147
Take an hour for dinner.

1191
01:28:40,494 --> 01:28:42,120
Your feet hurt?

1192
01:28:42,328 --> 01:28:46,196
I forgot to mention that.
It's an occupational disease.

1193
01:28:46,867 --> 01:28:49,859
You'd better go to dinner.
You only have an hour.

1194
01:29:00,649 --> 01:29:02,810
Oh, Joe, you wanted me to remind you.

1195
01:29:03,118 --> 01:29:05,552
- What?
- You haven't done the first act finale.

1196
01:29:05,720 --> 01:29:07,712
- You can't make the change.
- I forgot.

1197
01:29:07,924 --> 01:29:12,020
Well, I don't know who to
put in it, Artie. Let me see.

1198
01:29:12,228 --> 01:29:14,388
- Frank can't do it.
- No, he's in it now.

1199
01:29:14,629 --> 01:29:17,690
Or Charlie. A big number ahead of him.

1200
01:29:18,367 --> 01:29:22,634
Come away with me on Memory Island

1201
01:29:22,839 --> 01:29:26,741
Come away, my sweet To my own far land

1202
01:29:26,944 --> 01:29:30,072
Oh, Cynthia, you're a gay,
impetuous fool, aren't you?

1203
01:29:30,280 --> 01:29:33,272
Dig, dig, dig, dig for your dinner
Nothing's what you get for free

1204
01:29:35,052 --> 01:29:38,420
You silly little goose. You're a
mad, impetuous fool, aren't you?

1205
01:29:38,589 --> 01:29:42,525
Come away with me on Memory Island

1206
01:29:42,727 --> 01:29:46,857
- Come away, my sweet, to my own far...
- Herb.

1207
01:29:47,098 --> 01:29:49,430
- All right, you'll do the number.
- Who, me?

1208
01:29:49,667 --> 01:29:53,263
Why, this comes as a rather
surprise. I don't think I'm ready.

1209
01:29:53,439 --> 01:29:57,398
I have an orchestra in my dressing room.
I'll tune them up. I must tell my agent.

1210
01:29:57,576 --> 01:30:00,740
He'll be so pleased.
I haven't got an agent.

1211
01:30:04,783 --> 01:30:07,719
Jane, Jane, wait, I've
got something to tell you.

1212
01:30:08,321 --> 01:30:11,688
Old man Wingait's telling everybody
there ain't gonna be no show.

1213
01:30:11,891 --> 01:30:13,757
Says Orville's gonna stop it.

1214
01:30:13,961 --> 01:30:17,556
- Orville? How?
- I don't know.

1215
01:30:17,765 --> 01:30:19,756
They're talking about
returning their tickets.

1216
01:30:19,967 --> 01:30:25,496
But they can't do that. All that
money's been spent. Every penny. But...

1217
01:30:26,508 --> 01:30:31,571
Wait a minute, don't say
anything to anybody. Be quiet.

1218
01:30:33,916 --> 01:30:36,406
Yes sir, that boy of
mine is really wrought up.

1219
01:30:36,618 --> 01:30:39,485
"I'll stop that show if it's
the last thing I do," he says.

1220
01:30:39,654 --> 01:30:42,624
And by ginger, he means
it. Yes, come in, come in.

1221
01:30:42,825 --> 01:30:49,322
- Oh, Jane, you know the city aldermen.
- Oh, yeah, hello. Please sit down.

1222
01:30:50,633 --> 01:30:53,693
Mr. Wingait, where is
Orville? I can't find him.

1223
01:30:53,870 --> 01:30:57,773
- I've been to the house and I've been...
- I haven't see him since this morning.

1224
01:30:58,842 --> 01:31:02,643
It's not true he's going to do something
to interfere with the show, is it?

1225
01:31:02,814 --> 01:31:06,147
- You'll have to ask him.
- Well, I can't find him.

1226
01:31:07,117 --> 01:31:09,678
He just mustrt
interfere with this show.

1227
01:31:09,888 --> 01:31:12,288
It means too much to Joe.

1228
01:31:12,490 --> 01:31:14,856
Joe Ross, he...

1229
01:31:15,360 --> 01:31:18,125
It's his show.

1230
01:31:18,631 --> 01:31:21,657
- And a rumor like this could...
- I'm not so sure it is a rumor.

1231
01:31:21,867 --> 01:31:24,893
You know when he makes up his
mind, how headstrong Orville is.

1232
01:31:25,071 --> 01:31:27,266
Why, he's a young bull.

1233
01:31:27,473 --> 01:31:29,907
- Orv...?
- He's doing it for you, Jane.

1234
01:31:30,142 --> 01:31:33,874
A Wingait fighting tooth and
nail for the woman he loves.

1235
01:31:34,581 --> 01:31:39,416
All right, Mr. Wingait. I'm a Falbury,
fighting tooth and nail for the...

1236
01:31:39,653 --> 01:31:41,587
For this show.

1237
01:31:41,822 --> 01:31:44,154
And if Orville does
anything to interfere...

1238
01:31:44,324 --> 01:31:46,691
...there won't be any woman he loves.

1239
01:31:46,894 --> 01:31:49,692
- But, Jane.
- Tell that to the young bull.

1240
01:32:00,209 --> 01:32:01,574
There he is, Artie.

1241
01:32:01,810 --> 01:32:05,439
That's him. Jerry Solliman, the
biggest ticket broker on Broadway.

1242
01:32:09,018 --> 01:32:10,815
Well, this is it, kid.

1243
01:32:11,020 --> 01:32:13,249
- Herb, I'm scared.
- Scared?

1244
01:32:13,455 --> 01:32:16,050
Don't let me hear you talk
that way. What do you mean?

1245
01:32:16,259 --> 01:32:20,161
This is it, what we've been waiting for.
Nothing can stop us now. Opening night.

1246
01:32:20,330 --> 01:32:22,299
First thing you know,
you're on there alone.

1247
01:32:22,500 --> 01:32:26,937
All these people looking up at you
and then the spot hits you, and...

1248
01:32:34,445 --> 01:32:38,644
- You heard anything about Orville, Es?
- Oh, no. Don't worry about that.

1249
01:32:38,884 --> 01:32:41,910
My life and happiness...

1250
01:32:42,120 --> 01:32:45,886
Oh, I knew this, Es. I did
know it. I knew my lines.

1251
01:32:46,057 --> 01:32:47,957
What's happening to me?

1252
01:32:48,160 --> 01:32:50,391
Come in.

1253
01:32:50,763 --> 01:32:53,254
Oh, no, Joe, please,
don't you start on me now.

1254
01:32:53,432 --> 01:32:58,063
Esme, would you take these dresses
out to the stage for the quick changes?

1255
01:33:07,581 --> 01:33:10,015
I brought you these.

1256
01:33:11,753 --> 01:33:13,948
Not much for a star
on her opening night.

1257
01:33:14,122 --> 01:33:16,453
But it's the best I could do.

1258
01:33:16,823 --> 01:33:19,657
I picked them in your garden.

1259
01:33:21,095 --> 01:33:24,292
You mean, you're not gonna yell at me?

1260
01:33:25,166 --> 01:33:28,159
Why should I? You're wonderful.

1261
01:33:28,404 --> 01:33:31,532
Everything I ever hoped
for in a leading lady.

1262
01:33:35,277 --> 01:33:38,838
- You people are crazy.
- Sure.

1263
01:33:40,817 --> 01:33:42,842
Sure, we're crazy.

1264
01:33:43,153 --> 01:33:45,280
Here, give me your foot.

1265
01:33:45,488 --> 01:33:48,457
Now, you just relax. You're
gonna be great tonight.

1266
01:33:48,658 --> 01:33:51,491
I'm gonna be awful. You better
start yelling right now...

1267
01:33:51,661 --> 01:33:53,652
...because I can't
remember a single line.

1268
01:33:53,863 --> 01:33:56,128
They'll all come back
when the curtain goes up.

1269
01:33:56,334 --> 01:33:59,929
And remember, if you need me,
I'll be right there beside you.

1270
01:34:00,137 --> 01:34:03,574
- Will you, Joe?
- Every second.

1271
01:34:04,342 --> 01:34:08,803
And when the show's over and
it's the success I hope it is...

1272
01:34:09,014 --> 01:34:11,380
...we've got a lot of talking to do.

1273
01:34:12,651 --> 01:34:17,954
- What about?
- Oh, all kinds of things.

1274
01:34:18,157 --> 01:34:20,750
First, I wanna hear
the story of your life.

1275
01:34:20,993 --> 01:34:25,021
Everything that's ever happened
to you since you were so high.

1276
01:34:25,231 --> 01:34:27,756
And then I wanna know
what you eat for breakfast.

1277
01:34:28,001 --> 01:34:32,371
What's your favorite color.
What comic strips you read.

1278
01:34:33,340 --> 01:34:37,743
Then we'll talk about shoes
and ships and sealing wax...

1279
01:34:38,178 --> 01:34:42,706
...and shows and farms and families.

1280
01:34:42,916 --> 01:34:46,717
It may take hours. Weeks.

1281
01:34:46,921 --> 01:34:50,118
Years. I wanna know everything.

1282
01:34:54,029 --> 01:34:57,931
Now I won't... Now I
won't remember a word.

1283
01:35:03,873 --> 01:35:05,774
Good luck.

1284
01:35:06,276 --> 01:35:07,265
Good luck.

1285
01:35:15,018 --> 01:35:18,112
It's a lovely world
That's all around you

1286
01:35:18,322 --> 01:35:21,383
Count your treasures

- What kind of call?

1337
01:38:36,302 --> 01:38:38,792
- What's he want with you?

1338
01:38:39,004 --> 01:38:41,166
- Well, where is he?

- Don't know. Well...
- Don't know.

1341
01:38:49,182 --> 01:38:50,672
He don't know nothing.

We get up each morning at noon

1343

And our day is a glorious tune

1344

1345
01:39:08,169 --> 01:39:11,935
We live it, we love it, mais oui

1346
01:39:13,207 --> 01:39:16,871
The morning, A scherzo
by Brahms or Fauré

1347
01:39:17,079 --> 01:39:20,048
Or maybe a quaint
Little French rondelet

1348
01:39:20,716 --> 01:39:24,983
We're cultured, tactful, discreet

1349
01:39:25,689 --> 01:39:30,422
We're definitely of the elite

1350
01:39:42,906 --> 01:39:45,432
You wake up in the morning
And the rooster crows

1351
01:39:49,547 --> 01:39:51,880
You wake up in the morning
And the ducks quack, quack

1352
01:39:56,054 --> 01:39:58,248
The chicks peep, peep
The turkeys gobble

1353
01:39:58,456 --> 01:40:00,425
The sheep baa, baa
And the cows moo, moo

1354
01:40:00,626 --> 01:40:02,685
You might think it's an awful squabble

1355
01:40:07,266 --> 01:40:10,861
To me that's heavenly music

1356
01:40:11,337 --> 01:40:15,637
That's heavenly music to me

1357
01:40:15,875 --> 01:40:17,866
Some folks like the noise of a city

1358
01:40:18,077 --> 01:40:20,068
They think our barnyard
songs ain't pretty

1359
01:40:20,280 --> 01:40:23,841
They even say it
mostly sounds off-key

1360
01:40:24,051 --> 01:40:28,955
Still it's heavenly music to me

1361
01:40:33,360 --> 01:40:35,420
I love to hear the music
When the donkeys bray

1362
01:40:37,999 --> 01:40:40,160
Chickens start to cackle
And it sounds right gay

1363
01:40:42,138 --> 01:40:44,265
Pigs oink, oink The birds are trillir

1364
01:40:44,473 --> 01:40:46,599
The frogs croak, croak
And the hens cluck, cluck

1365
01:40:46,775 --> 01:40:48,903
The crows caw, caw
Gol'dernit, it's thrilling

1366
01:40:52,481 --> 01:40:54,574
Aw, shucks, to me

1367
01:40:54,784 --> 01:40:57,185
That's heavenly music

1368
01:40:57,421 --> 01:41:01,585
That's heavenly music to me

1369
01:41:10,033 --> 01:41:14,971
Still it's heavenly music to me

1370
01:41:15,173 --> 01:41:17,107
The cats meow The crickets jumping

1371
01:41:17,308 --> 01:41:19,299
The billy goats bleat
And the geese peck, peck

1372
01:41:19,510 --> 01:41:21,444
The owls hoot, hoot
Now ain't that sumpir?

1373
01:41:25,417 --> 01:41:29,410
Why, heck! To me that's heavenly music

1374
01:41:30,355 --> 01:41:34,452
That's heavenly music to me

1375
01:41:38,497 --> 01:41:43,458
Yes, that's heavenly music to me

1376
01:42:19,408 --> 01:42:20,875
Heavenly music

1377
01:42:21,077 --> 01:42:23,204
Yes, it's heavenly music

1378
01:42:23,412 --> 01:42:30,182
Yes, it's heavenly music to me

1379
01:43:00,886 --> 01:43:03,878
Forget your troubles

1380
01:43:04,056 --> 01:43:06,423

For the judgment day

01:45:31,882 --> 01:45:34,612
Get her into that for the reprise.

1425
01:45:35,487 --> 01:45:37,750
How'd you like it?

1426
01:45:38,189 --> 01:45:40,180
Don't know, huh?

1427
01:45:45,130 --> 01:45:48,930
- Can't you go any faster, Orville?
- I'm going as fast as I can with safety.

1428
01:45:49,134 --> 01:45:51,968
If I hadrt looked all over New
York for you, we'd be there.

1429
01:45:52,204 --> 01:45:54,570
- But they're holding the curtain for me.
- I know.

1430
01:45:54,773 --> 01:45:56,901
I sent them a wire, didn't I?

1431
01:45:58,244 --> 01:45:59,939
Didrt I?

1432
01:46:00,146 --> 01:46:01,977
You did?

1433
01:46:04,752 --> 01:46:06,583
Oh, no.

1434
01:46:06,754 --> 01:46:09,916
Orville... Orville, look out!

1435
01:46:15,429 --> 01:46:17,226
Hey, kids, it went great.

1436
01:46:17,431 --> 01:46:20,765
- Joe, did I make any mistakes?
- You were beautiful. How about it, Es?

1437
01:46:20,969 --> 01:46:23,870
- She slayed them.
- Jane. Jane, I just want...

1438
01:46:24,072 --> 01:46:27,439
Orville! Oh, if you do
anything to stop this show...!

1439
01:46:27,642 --> 01:46:29,507
- I don't wanna stop it.
- You don't?

1440
01:46:29,744 --> 01:46:32,771
Of course not. What do you
think I went to New York for?

1441
01:46:32,948 --> 01:46:34,916
Why did you come here
if you don't want...?

1442
01:46:35,151 --> 01:46:36,618
Quiet!

1443
01:46:36,819 --> 01:46:39,344
- I wanna get this settled.
- I think it's a good idea.

1444
01:46:39,556 --> 01:46:42,615
I think so too. Jane,
you can get out of that...

1445
01:46:42,825 --> 01:46:44,793
Abigail's here. You
can give it to her.

1446
01:46:44,994 --> 01:46:48,487
Why wasrt she here four
days ago when we needed her?

1447
01:46:48,698 --> 01:46:51,394
You can't switch actors in
the middle of a performance.

1448
01:46:51,635 --> 01:46:53,500
- Why not?
- We're going great out there.

1449
01:46:53,703 --> 01:46:55,672
I've never had so much fun in my life.

1450
01:46:55,873 --> 01:46:58,636
- What are you talking about?
- This is what I'm talking about.

1451
01:46:58,842 --> 01:47:02,006
Smell. Greasepaint. Show business.

1452
01:47:02,213 --> 01:47:04,807
- Gesundheit.
- Joe, Janie. Change for your next number.

1453
01:47:05,016 --> 01:47:06,847
- Orville.
- Jane, I'm warning you.

1454
01:47:07,051 --> 01:47:09,919
If you step on-stage, you're
forcing me to close the show.

1455
01:47:10,089 --> 01:47:12,148
I'm warning you, Orville.

1456
01:47:12,357 --> 01:47:14,881
If you even look like you're
gonna close this show...

1457
01:47:15,093 --> 01:47:18,928
...I won't break our
engagement, I'll break your head!

1458
01:47:19,398 --> 01:47:22,094
- Jane, you're sweet.
- Oh, Joe.

1459
01:47:22,334 --> 01:47:25,031
- Did you hear...?
- Yes, I did. I'm trying to tell you.

1460
01:47:25,238 --> 01:47:28,934
- Will you please be quiet!
- I just don't understand...

1461
01:47:29,208 --> 01:47:30,733
That actor.

1462
01:47:30,944 --> 01:47:33,071
She's in love with that actor.

1463
01:47:33,313 --> 01:47:34,940
And that actor is in love with her.

1464
01:47:35,181 --> 01:47:37,673
- I'm not gonna stand for this.
- Stay where you are.

1465
01:47:37,885 --> 01:47:39,216
- Stay out of the way.
- No.

1466
01:47:39,420 --> 01:47:40,944
- I'm warning you.
- I'm warning you!

1467
01:47:41,188 --> 01:47:42,746
I'm giving an order around here.

1468
01:47:42,957 --> 01:47:45,619
The Falburys give the
orders and I'm a Falbury.

1469
01:47:45,860 --> 01:47:48,385
Sheriff, come over here.

1470
01:47:48,596 --> 01:47:52,431
- Yep. She's a Falbury, all right.
- Orville, speak to me.

1471
01:47:52,634 --> 01:47:56,229
He'll be all right. Just take him
out in the air. He'll be all right.

1472
01:47:56,438 --> 01:47:59,738
Will you please leave us alone?

1473
01:47:59,942 --> 01:48:03,741
Orville, darling, I didn't mean to...

1474
01:48:04,713 --> 01:48:07,080
The Falburys and the Wingaits.

1475
01:48:07,350 --> 01:48:08,840
- Howdy, neighbor
- Howdy, neighbor

1476
01:48:09,051 --> 01:48:10,484
- Happy harvest
- Happy harvest

1477
01:48:10,720 --> 01:48:13,952
Get your rocking chairs
For all your cares are over

1478
01:48:14,158 --> 01:48:17,593
Clap your hands and lick your chops
Your bumper crops are on the climb

1479
01:48:17,793 --> 01:48:21,230
- Hey, we're gonna roll in plenty
- Spend a five or 10 or 20

1480
01:48:21,431 --> 01:48:24,400
And those happy harvest
bells Are gonna chime

1481
01:48:24,601 --> 01:48:28,299
Remember, neighbor When
your work for Mother Nature

1482
01:48:28,673 --> 01:48:31,369
You got paid

1483
01:48:31,543 --> 01:48:43,581
By Father Time
