concern either you or me.

refer to it again.

I see the boating craze is over.

99
00:08:12,959 --> 00:08:15,757
First it was sailing.
Then he tired of that.

100
00:08:15,862 --> 00:08:19,525
He took up punting. This year
I've been giving him rowing lessons.

Has he?
What a stroke of luck.

108
00:08:48,294 --> 00:08:50,990
- No. No. No. It was dreadful.
- You can live with me.

109
00:08:51,130 --> 00:08:53,030
He's going to live with me. Toad.

110
00:08:53,132 --> 00:08:55,726
No. I just acquired the latest thing!
Come and see!

111
00:08:55,868 --> 00:08:57,768
Toad.

112
00:08:57,870 --> 00:09:00,338
- How's the boating?
- Boating? Oh. Pooh!

113
00:09:00,473 --> 00:09:04,671
Silly. Boyish amusement.
Gave that up ages ago.

[Toad Chuckling]
Don't mind them. Bit of a stuffy lot.

116
00:09:11,317 --> 00:09:13,046
[Snorts]
Yes.

117
00:09:13,185 --> 00:09:16,348
I was hoping you'd help me
get my home back.

118
00:09:16,489 --> 00:09:18,389
It was in your meadow.
You see. Toad.

119
00:09:18,491 --> 00:09:21,619
Pooh! Not my meadow any longer.

120
00:09:21,761 --> 00:09:24,662
Sold it off.
I needed a spot of ready cash.

121
00:09:25,765 --> 00:09:28,962
He sold off my hole.

122
00:09:29,101 --> 00:09:31,729
Now. Iook here. Toad.

123
00:09:31,871 --> 00:09:34,203
That meadow belonged
to your father.

124
00:09:34,307 --> 00:09:38,607
Moles have lived there for centuries.
You can'tjust sell it off.

125
00:09:38,711 --> 00:09:41,737
Behold your new home. Moley!

126
00:09:43,115 --> 00:09:45,606
- What is it?
- Very heavy.

127
00:09:46,852 --> 00:09:48,877
It's the latest thing!

128
00:09:50,189 --> 00:09:52,384
But I don't want
a new home. Ratty.

129
00:09:52,525 --> 00:09:55,926
The open road!
The dusty highway!

130
00:09:56,028 --> 00:09:58,428
Heath and hedgerow
and rolling down.

131
00:09:58,531 --> 00:10:01,432
- Here today.
- Off to somewhere else tomorrow!

132
00:10:01,534 --> 00:10:04,002
It doesn't bear thinking about.

133
00:10:05,938 --> 00:10:09,567
- I-It's a caravan.
- Ooh, finest cart ever built.

134
00:10:09,575 --> 00:10:11,941
Designed it myself. Of course.

135
00:10:12,044 --> 00:10:14,740
And we can set off after lunch.

136
00:10:14,880 --> 00:10:17,872
- Oh. Stop there. Toady.
- Travel. Change. Excitement!

137
00:10:18,017 --> 00:10:22,113
Did I just hear you say "start" and "we"
and "after lunch"?

138
00:10:22,254 --> 00:10:26,748
Oh. Dear old Ratty. You can't just stick
to your fusty old river all your life.

139
00:10:26,892 --> 00:10:28,826
I want to show you the world!

140
00:10:28,961 --> 00:10:31,395
I don't want to see
the world and I'm...

141
00:10:31,530 --> 00:10:34,499
going to stick to
my fusty old river.

142
00:10:34,634 --> 00:10:37,535
Moley and I are going for a picnic on it.
Aren't we. Mole?

143
00:10:37,637 --> 00:10:42,199
- Y-Yes. Once we found out
what happened to my home.
- Oh. Absolutely.

144
00:10:42,341 --> 00:10:44,571
Then it's all settled.
We set off after lunch.

145
00:10:57,223 --> 00:10:59,054
I say. Horsey. Faster!

146
00:11:00,259 --> 00:11:02,693
It's very kind of Mr. Toad.
Of course. But...

147
00:11:02,828 --> 00:11:05,228
it's not like having my own hole.

148
00:11:05,331 --> 00:11:08,266
Don't worry.
He'll soon get bored with it.

149

[Loud Yawn]

150
00:11:14,473 --> 00:11:18,705
[Rat] Toad, when you say you
sold off your meadow...

151
00:11:18,811 --> 00:11:21,143
who did you sell it to?

152
00:11:21,247 --> 00:11:24,182
Oh. Some weasels. I believe.

153
00:11:24,283 --> 00:11:26,513
Weasels? Toad!

154
00:11:26,619 --> 00:11:29,179
Oh. Don't... don't start lecturing me.

155
00:11:29,321 --> 00:11:31,585
You know perfectly well
the weasels are after Toad Hall.

156
00:11:31,691 --> 00:11:35,559
- It was only a meadow.
- It was Mole's home.

157
00:11:35,661 --> 00:11:38,721
- Oh. Pooh! You worry too much.
- [Disgusted Sigh]

158

That's his business.

We'll call the shots around here.

312
00:21:39,231 --> 00:21:41,961
He's going to
live with me. Badger.

313
00:21:45,470 --> 00:21:48,735
It was only a small.
Dingy little place.

314
00:21:48,840 --> 00:21:51,206
Not like here. Badger...

315
00:21:51,310 --> 00:21:54,404
or your cozy quarters. Rat...

316
00:21:55,781 --> 00:21:58,716
or Toad's beautiful hall.

317
00:21:58,817 --> 00:22:02,446
But it was my own.
My very own little hole.

318
00:22:02,554 --> 00:22:04,488
That good-for-nothing Toad!

319
00:22:04,589 --> 00:22:07,251
And now he's crashed
yet another motorcar.

320
00:22:07,359 --> 00:22:10,260
- How many is that?
- Cars or crashes?

321
00:22:10,362 --> 00:22:12,262
It's the same thing with Toad.

322
00:22:13,598 --> 00:22:16,692
- This is the seventh.
- [Knocking]

323
00:22:16,802 --> 00:22:21,603
- [Bell Ringing]
- This is an outrage.

324
00:22:25,444 --> 00:22:30,575
- Oh. Ow! Ouch!
- I've had quite enough visitors for one winter.

325
00:22:30,682 --> 00:22:34,277
I was attacked by weasels.
Hundreds of them.

326
00:22:34,386 --> 00:22:36,286
Did they sing a dreadful song?

327
00:22:36,388 --> 00:22:40,586
They wanted me to put up Toad Hall
as collateral against a new motor.

328
00:22:40,692 --> 00:22:42,785
- Toad. You didn't!
- Of course not.

329
00:22:42,894 --> 00:22:46,796
- The old place is worth at least six new motors.
- Six motorcars?

330
00:22:46,898 --> 00:22:49,458
It's time you stopped
this motoring craze.

331
00:22:49,568 --> 00:22:51,763
It'd cost the earth. Toady.

332
00:22:51,870 --> 00:22:55,237
- You've squandered the money
your father left you.
- Haven't. There's tons of it.

333
00:22:55,340 --> 00:22:59,208
Your father was a particular
friend of mine. Toad.

334
00:22:59,311 --> 00:23:02,542
And I promised him on his deathbed
that I would ensure...

335
00:23:02,647 --> 00:23:05,673
that you looked after
your inheritance.

336
00:23:05,784 --> 00:23:08,446
- I was only having a bit of fun. Badger.
- So you're a nincompoop.

337
00:23:08,553 --> 00:23:11,249
Oh. Thank you. Badger.

338
00:23:11,356 --> 00:23:14,917
Toad. "nincompoop"
is not a compliment.

339
00:23:15,026 --> 00:23:16,926
Oh. Isn't it?

340
00:23:18,130 --> 00:23:20,928
Take off those ridiculous goggles.

341
00:23:21,032 --> 00:23:22,932
- Shan't.
- Rat.

342
00:23:23,034 --> 00:23:27,130
[Gasps]
I say. Badger!

343
00:23:27,239 --> 00:23:29,901
- Now the driving gloves.
- Oh. Not my gloves.

344
00:23:30,008 --> 00:23:34,001
Oh. No. They're brand new.
Cost a fortune.

345
00:23:34,112 --> 00:23:36,137
Exactly.

346
00:23:36,248 --> 00:23:40,947
- [Toad] Ohh!
- Now you will accompany me in there...

347
00:23:41,052 --> 00:23:44,419
where you're going to hear
a few facts about yourself.

348
00:23:46,124 --> 00:23:49,116
- [Door Slams]
- [Badger] Pull yourself together!

349
00:23:49,227 --> 00:23:52,390
- [Toad Whimpering]
- You're light-minded,
incompetent, irresponsible...

350
00:23:52,497 --> 00:23:54,931
impractical with your property!

351
00:23:55,033 --> 00:23:57,467
[Yelling Continues, Faint]

352
00:23:59,638 --> 00:24:02,038
Goodness only knows
what your father would have said!

353
00:24:02,140 --> 00:24:05,837
- [Toad Crying]
- Don't give me "boo-hoo-hoo"!

354
00:24:05,944 --> 00:24:08,412
It's no good
"boo-hoo-hoo"now!

355
00:24:08,513 --> 00:24:11,482
You should have thought of that
in the first place...

356
00:24:11,583 --> 00:24:15,144
before you started squandering the money
your father left you!

357
00:24:15,253 --> 00:24:17,153
[Clock Bell Dinging]

358
00:24:17,255 --> 00:24:19,348
[Door Opening]

359
00:24:26,364 --> 00:24:29,265
My friends.
I'm pleased to inform you...

360
00:24:29,367 --> 00:24:33,235
that Toad has something important
to say to you both.

361
00:24:33,338 --> 00:24:35,704
Sit down. Toad.

362
00:24:42,013 --> 00:24:43,913
Right. Toad.

363
00:24:46,551 --> 00:24:49,952
Begin with the "how-sorry-l-am" bit.

364
00:24:51,690 --> 00:24:54,818
"Oh. How sorry I am that
I have been so foolish."

365
00:24:54,926 --> 00:24:56,951
B-But I'm not sorry.

366
00:24:57,062 --> 00:25:01,192
It wasn't foolish.
It was simply glorious.

367
00:25:01,299 --> 00:25:04,166
But didn't you just
tell me in there...

368
00:25:04,269 --> 00:25:07,238
Oh. Yes. Yes. In there.
I'd have said anything in there.

369
00:25:07,339 --> 00:25:09,739
You backsliding wretch.

370
00:25:09,841 --> 00:25:12,708
Oh. Dear Badger.
You're so eloquent.

371
00:25:12,811 --> 00:25:15,245
You can make me say
whatever you like in there.

372
00:25:15,347 --> 00:25:17,406
But I've been thinking
it over out here...

373
00:25:17,516 --> 00:25:20,246
and I find that out here
I'm not the least bit sorry.

374
00:25:20,352 --> 00:25:22,684
So it's no earthly good
saying I am. Now. Is it?

375
00:25:22,787 --> 00:25:26,052
So you don't promise never
to touch another motorcar again?

376
00:25:26,157 --> 00:25:29,888
On the contrary.
I promise the very next motorcar I see...

377
00:25:29,995 --> 00:25:32,361
Pooh. Pooh!

378
00:25:32,430 --> 00:25:34,193
Pooh. Pooh! Off I go in it!

379
00:25:35,066 --> 00:25:36,966
Ooh! Ooh!

380
00:25:37,068 --> 00:25:39,093
Very well. Gentlemen. It's plan "B."

381
00:25:42,340 --> 00:25:44,240
Plan "B"?

382
00:25:44,342 --> 00:25:47,277
Yes. Ratty. Plan "B."

383
00:25:47,379 --> 00:25:51,281
- Hey. Badger!
- Behave like a nincompoop...

384
00:25:51,383 --> 00:25:54,318
you'll be treated
like a nincompoop!

385
00:25:54,419 --> 00:25:58,219
[Toad]
Oh! Oh! Ooh! Hey!

386
00:25:59,858 --> 00:26:03,589
[Toad] Where are you taking me?
This is no way to treat a Toad.

387
00:26:03,695 --> 00:26:06,823
- I've never been treated so atrociously.
- Shut up. Toad.

388
00:26:06,932 --> 00:26:08,832
How much further is it. Badger?

389
00:26:08,934 --> 00:26:12,097
This tunnel will take us
right to Toad Hall.

390
00:26:12,203 --> 00:26:14,603
We're under his meadow now.

391
00:26:14,706 --> 00:26:17,539
How under earth did you find
the time to do all this. Badger?

392
00:26:17,642 --> 00:26:19,542
Oh. I didn't.

393
00:26:19,644 --> 00:26:24,172
Long. Long ago. There
was a city of humans right here.

394
00:26:24,282 --> 00:26:26,614
They thought their city
would endure forever...

395
00:26:26,718 --> 00:26:28,948
but humans can't
let things rest.

396
00:26:29,054 --> 00:26:32,114
Greed. You see...
that's their undoing.

397
00:26:32,223 --> 00:26:36,159
But we remain.
There were badgers here before...

398
00:26:36,261 --> 00:26:38,320
- and there'll be badgers here still.
- [Metal Clanking]

399
00:27:03,455 --> 00:27:06,049
[Weakly]
Tea time.

400
00:27:06,157 --> 00:27:08,057
Shh.

401
00:27:14,299 --> 00:27:16,995
We'll teach those weasels. Moley.

402
00:27:24,542 --> 00:27:27,067
[Toad]
Come on, you chaps. Just let me out.

403
00:27:27,178 --> 00:27:30,579
You know you can trust me.

404
00:27:30,682 --> 00:27:34,448
Please! Please, let me out.
[Weeping]

405
00:27:36,655 --> 00:27:39,715
Ooh! Let me out!
Let me out! Ooh!

406
00:27:39,824 --> 00:27:43,624
- What's going on? I shall write my solicitor!
- Shut up. Toad!

407
00:27:43,728 --> 00:27:46,629
- You want the servants to hear?
- Is this Toad Hall?

408
00:27:46,731 --> 00:27:49,393
- Shh!
- I'll be the laughingstock of the kitchen.

409
00:27:49,501 --> 00:27:52,470
- Then shut up!
- [Both Grunting]

410
00:27:52,570 --> 00:27:55,471
- I'm sorry. Sir. I just don't know.
- [Sighs]

411
00:27:55,573 --> 00:27:59,270
- Oh. Good day. I am looking for Mr. Toad.
- He's not here.

412
00:28:04,582 --> 00:28:06,482
Ouch!

413
00:28:06,584 --> 00:28:10,452
I have six new motorcars for him.

414
00:28:10,555 --> 00:28:12,580
- Toad!
- You reprobate.

415
00:28:12,691 --> 00:28:14,591
My new motors!
Oh, are they brand new?

416
00:28:14,693 --> 00:28:16,752
Oh, I must see them! Let me out!

417
00:28:16,861 --> 00:28:20,262
- Mr. Toad will not be requiring
any new motorcars. Thank you.
- Yes, I do!

418
00:28:20,365 --> 00:28:22,925
- I love them! Let me out!
- H-He's not well.

419
00:28:23,034 --> 00:28:25,832
Ooh, I can see them!
Oh, they're wonders!

420
00:28:25,937 --> 00:28:29,737
- Hurrah!
- He's suffering from a mania
brought about by motorcars.

421
00:28:29,841 --> 00:28:31,934
It's not a mania.
I love motorcars.

422
00:28:32,043 --> 00:28:35,809
As his physician. I have ordered
he be taken and locked in his room...

423
00:28:35,914 --> 00:28:38,007
until this mania
has run its course.

424

- Those cars are my life,
my soul, my raison d'etre!

00:28:41,653 --> 00:28:45,020
Mr. Toad owes me money.

I love motorcars! Please!

- Let me out!
- Can I make a proposition?

429
00:28:51,796 --> 00:28:55,129
- We're always open to a deal.
- How's this then?

00:28:55,233 --> 00:28:59,636
If you remove these

So. Badger thinks he can cure Toad
of motorcars. Does he?

- We don't want him to do that. Chief.
- I know.

- We want him to spend every last penny he's got.
- I know.

- So he has to give us Toad Hall.

Come on.
[Grunts]

465
00:31:12,370 --> 00:31:15,134
Toady. I wish you'd get better.

466
00:31:15,240 --> 00:31:17,265
You know. It's been months now.

467
00:31:17,375 --> 00:31:21,971
[Groans]
Perhaps if l... Oh. But. No. I mustn't ask.

468
00:31:22,080 --> 00:31:25,379
- What?
- I was just thinking I might improve...

469
00:31:25,483 --> 00:31:27,542
with a little fresh air.

470
00:31:27,652 --> 00:31:30,143
Oh. No. No. No.
I can't let you out of this room.

471
00:31:30,255 --> 00:31:32,155
You're quite right. Ratty.

472
00:31:32,257 --> 00:31:35,920
Although I was only thinking
of a little stroll...

473
00:31:36,027 --> 00:31:37,585
along the river.

474
00:31:38,863 --> 00:31:43,766
The river.
Oh. It's so beautiful in the snow.

475
00:31:43,868 --> 00:31:46,530
- [Water Running]
- But you're quite right.

476
00:31:46,638 --> 00:31:49,106
I should stay here safe indoors.

477
00:31:49,207 --> 00:31:53,337
Besides. You can't have a picnic
in the middle of winter.

478
00:31:53,444 --> 00:31:58,108
Oh. But you can. Everybody thinks you can't.
But you can have a picnic anytime.

479
00:31:58,216 --> 00:32:01,777
In fact, winter picnics
are my speciality.

480
00:32:01,886 --> 00:32:05,378
All you need
is a hot thermos. A warm rug.

481
00:32:05,490 --> 00:32:08,948
I know the most perfect
little hollow where you can get all snug...

482
00:32:09,060 --> 00:32:10,960
and watch the snow.

483
00:32:11,062 --> 00:32:13,622
- I mean. If anything could take my mind off...
- Quite. Quite.

484
00:32:13,731 --> 00:32:16,791
A picnic on the river certainly
would do it. A winter picnic too.

485
00:32:16,901 --> 00:32:19,961
There's a picnic hamper
in the cellar all ready.

486
00:32:20,071 --> 00:32:22,130
N-No. No. Toad. I can't.

487
00:32:22,240 --> 00:32:26,973
- It might be the very cure.
- Well. Of course. A picnic
on the river cures anything.

488
00:32:27,078 --> 00:32:31,139
Oh. Toady. If you
promise me faithfully to behave.

489
00:32:31,249 --> 00:32:33,149
Oh. You know me. Ratty.

490
00:32:33,251 --> 00:32:35,583
A picnic on the river!

491
00:32:35,687 --> 00:32:37,655
- Why didn't we think of it before?
- You'll have to go...

492
00:32:37,755 --> 00:32:39,882
right down to the cellar
to get the hamper.

493
00:32:39,991 --> 00:32:42,789
Look. Um. Toady...

494
00:32:42,894 --> 00:32:45,328
best not mention anything
about this to Badger.

495
00:32:45,430 --> 00:32:48,866
Oh-ho-ho. Wouldn't dream of it.
Old fellow.

I wonder if they'd... sell it.

Of course. I'd...
I'd have to test it first...

is hardly sufficient...

531
00:35:22,620 --> 00:35:26,784
for the heinous. Callous.
Unmitigatedly evil crime...

I understood that you were
counsel for the defense.

00:35:45,143 --> 00:35:49,637
Indeed. I am. Milord.
But his crime is so blackguardly...

539
00:35:49,747 --> 00:35:52,682
that this is. In fact.
The best defense that can be offered.

I see. Counsel for the prosecution...

do you wish to add to what counsel for
the defense has said?

No. Milord. I would just like to wag
my finger at the accused a few times.

Witnesses. Milord? How can there be?
It is an open-and-shut case.

- He even insulted an officer of the law.
- He called me a nincompoop.

that can be done in the circumstances.

Oh. Yipes! It's you lot.

01:01:24,580 --> 01:01:26,980
Toad. What are you
doing out of jail?

01:01:27,083 --> 01:01:30,052
Hmph! I escaped by great daring
and cleverness.

And I demand you hand back

- Of course. It's all yours.
- Oh.

You're a clever one
and no mistake, Toad.

940
01:01:50,373 --> 01:01:52,637
Yes. Drove a train. Just like that.

941
01:01:52,742 --> 01:01:57,236
Did you? Well. We've got a new motor
we'd like you to... test for us.

- Sort of experimental. Is it?

are these blades here.

- Oh. Yes. I see.
- They rotate...

959
01:03:32,375 --> 01:03:37,574

through those holes.
