1
00:00:41,555 --> 00:00:45,286
I Iove you.

2
00:00:47,828 --> 00:00:51,286
I Iove you.

3
00:01:08,648 --> 00:01:11,344
whiIe coming and going

4
00:01:12,352 --> 00:01:15,344
Laughing and smiIing.

5
00:01:16,323 --> 00:01:22,523
I had thought about it in my heart.

6
00:01:23,930 --> 00:01:27,525
That flrst Iook

7
00:01:27,734 --> 00:01:31,192
That sIight reaction.

8
00:01:31,805 --> 00:01:37,607
why does it make my heart restIess.

9
00:01:39,613 --> 00:01:42,673
Stopping then waIking

10
00:01:43,383 --> 00:01:46,716
WaIking then stopping

11
00:01:47,354 --> 00:01:53,623
Don't know whom you are waiting
for

12
00:01:54,628 --> 00:01:58,564
Yourtrust..

13
00:01:58,732 --> 00:02:02,168
..is it based on me

14
00:02:02,502 --> 00:02:08,702
I feeI it is on me again and again.

15
00:02:09,643 --> 00:02:16,708
OnIy this is true,
maybe, I am in Iove.

16
00:02:18,518 --> 00:02:25,253
Yes, yes, I Iove you.

17
00:02:34,267 --> 00:02:36,531
whiIe coming and going

18
00:02:37,537 --> 00:02:40,199
Laughing and singing

19
00:02:41,374 --> 00:02:47,370
I and thought about it in my heart

20
00:02:49,382 --> 00:02:55,617
That bud of flower

21
00:02:56,690 --> 00:03:02,492
BIossomed a IittIe

22
00:03:04,498 --> 00:03:07,331
whom is my heart beating for.

23
00:03:08,502 --> 00:03:12,165
who are you? Let me know

24
00:03:12,239 --> 00:03:18,178
why have I started trusting you?

25
00:03:20,313 --> 00:03:26,252
ShouId I keep quiet

26
00:03:27,654 --> 00:03:33,251
Or shouId I teII every one

27
00:03:35,362 --> 00:03:41,790
Or shouId I trust you

28
00:03:42,669 --> 00:03:47,197
Yes this is true that
I have faIIen in Iove.

29
00:03:47,274 --> 00:03:49,208
Yes, yes I have faIIen
in Iove with you.

30
00:04:08,328 --> 00:04:11,320
C-a-t Cat.

31
00:04:12,232 --> 00:04:14,564
B-a-t bat.

32
00:04:15,235 --> 00:04:18,170
c-a-t cat

33
00:04:26,179 --> 00:04:28,170
B-a-t bat

34
00:04:30,850 --> 00:04:32,374
These are chocoIates. Take these.

35
00:04:34,387 --> 00:04:35,513
where is she?
- There. - Fast!

36
00:04:52,472 --> 00:04:53,598
It's working.

37
00:05:31,845 --> 00:05:33,779
Suman dear,
- Rahim uncIe!

38
00:05:36,249 --> 00:05:37,443
Live Iong! Live Iong!

39
00:05:37,584 --> 00:05:39,176
CongratuIations!
Here, have these sweets.

40
00:05:39,519 --> 00:05:42,511
You have come number
one in Inter exam.

41
00:05:43,657 --> 00:05:45,716
CongratuIations! Okay,
teII me, where is your dad?

42
00:05:48,261 --> 00:05:50,525
Karan brother! what happened to

43
00:05:53,266 --> 00:05:54,324
You got bashed today too?

44
00:05:54,401 --> 00:05:56,801
IncIe Rahim, ifhe comes Iate to the
cIass then he wiII be punished, right?

45
00:05:56,870 --> 00:05:58,531
O Suman! Don't
consideryourseIf to be great!

46
00:05:59,539 --> 00:06:01,803
She has got educated somewhat..

47
00:06:02,475 --> 00:06:05,603
87% Inter.

48
00:06:05,679 --> 00:06:07,738
Even we know this inter and aII!

49
00:06:08,214 --> 00:06:09,476
C-a-t cat.. Cat means cat. Now teII!

50
00:06:09,549 --> 00:06:11,813
TeII! TeII!

00:06:14,621 --> 00:06:16,145
Right! Come now you show your

00:06:16,222 --> 00:06:17,314
where are you running!

53
00:06:23,329 --> 00:06:24,626
Show!
- Dad, I've hurt this hand.

54
00:06:26,332 --> 00:06:28,163
where?
- Here! -You! Take care!

55
00:06:28,334 --> 00:06:29,699
ReaIIy..

56
00:06:34,641 --> 00:06:37,633
You father and daughter
share a IoveIy reIationship.

57
00:06:39,179 --> 00:06:41,511
I onIy Iive for her.

58
00:06:42,449 --> 00:06:45,577
Otherwise this is not the
age for me to be dancing.

59
00:06:45,652 --> 00:06:49,179
My bIessing is that you keep
kumping and dancing Iike this.

60
00:06:51,524 --> 00:06:53,856
Your kob is conflrmed in Dubai.

61
00:06:54,594 --> 00:06:57,392
ReaIIy!? - Six month kob
and good remuneration.

62
00:06:58,531 --> 00:07:01,466
Here is your passport and
aII the requisite papers.

63
00:07:02,602 --> 00:07:05,469
But what have you
thought about Suman?

64
00:07:07,474 --> 00:07:11,308
I think I'II Ieave her at my
friend, Kishen's pIace in the city.

65
00:07:12,479 --> 00:07:15,471
You're very worried for me.
That's why you're Ieaving me.

66
00:07:18,818 --> 00:07:20,479
I'm onIy worried about you.

67
00:07:22,622 --> 00:07:24,283
I have to earn money.

68
00:07:25,759 --> 00:07:27,317
The house has to be done up.

69
00:07:29,496 --> 00:07:31,157
I have to get you married.

70
00:07:37,504 --> 00:07:39,836
I'II reaIIy miss you.

71
00:07:41,374 --> 00:07:44,366
I'II stay here and wait foryou.

72
00:07:45,578 --> 00:07:48,376
I don't know anybody in the city.

73
00:07:50,517 --> 00:07:52,382
Is that what's worrying you?

74
00:07:55,655 --> 00:07:57,850
Listen to what she's saying.

75
00:08:01,728 --> 00:08:05,664
SiIIy girI! They'II pamperyou.

76
00:08:07,300 --> 00:08:09,131
I have that reIation with them.

77
00:08:09,536 --> 00:08:11,470
It's been years since I met Kishen.

78
00:08:13,339 --> 00:08:17,139
Sometimes such a hunger
arises to hug him that..

79
00:08:18,545 --> 00:08:21,810
Sometimes my heart runs towards
you.

80
00:08:23,316 --> 00:08:27,480
And sometimes towards him.
Towards his friendship.

81
00:08:28,421 --> 00:08:31,481
I don't know when the
foundation was Iaid.

82
00:08:33,626 --> 00:08:34,684
And why?

83
00:08:35,328 --> 00:08:38,695
I never studied but he
was aIways into books.

84
00:08:39,432 --> 00:08:44,495
I'd keep Iooking at him. Going to
town, progressing, earning money..

85
00:08:44,571 --> 00:08:46,232
But his pocket was aIways empty.

86
00:08:47,307 --> 00:08:49,332
He feIt shy taking money from me.

87
00:08:51,344 --> 00:08:53,835
He wouId smiIe and I'd be happy.

88
00:08:54,514 --> 00:08:59,713
Once he soId his books in
orderto return my money.

89
00:09:00,453 --> 00:09:02,284
I sIapped him reaI hard!

90
00:09:02,589 --> 00:09:04,648
He thought my
friendship was an obIigation.

91
00:09:11,464 --> 00:09:14,456
I feIt peace onIy after
bringing back his books.

92
00:09:20,473 --> 00:09:22,464
I rememberwhen he got married.

93
00:09:23,309 --> 00:09:27,643
He stepped into a new worId.
I got a cute sister-in-Iaw.

94
00:09:28,481 --> 00:09:29,675
She was aIways smiIing.

95
00:09:30,483 --> 00:09:32,474
But I knew she was sad.

96
00:09:34,487 --> 00:09:37,820
To have a IittIe
flower in her bosom.

97
00:09:40,226 --> 00:09:41,352
I took them to the tempIe.

98
00:09:41,561 --> 00:09:44,359
We pIeaded forwishes, kept fasts.

99
00:09:44,564 --> 00:09:47,829
Then Lord Rama gave them a boon.

100
00:09:48,334 --> 00:09:52,361
Wlth a name that wouId
make aII hearts bIoom.

101
00:09:53,439 --> 00:09:55,430
TwinkIe twinkIe IittIe star,
how I wonderwhat you are.

102
00:09:55,775 --> 00:09:58,369
Ip above the worId so high

103
00:09:58,711 --> 00:10:01,373
Like a diamond..

104
00:10:01,648 --> 00:10:04,344
..in the sky.

105
00:10:15,528 --> 00:10:19,692
Kishen's fate Iooked up with the
birth ofhis son. He went to city.

106
00:10:20,700 --> 00:10:22,861
He started his own business.

107
00:10:24,370 --> 00:10:25,530
And became a big man.

108
00:10:26,272 --> 00:10:28,365
They came here again.

109
00:10:30,276 --> 00:10:31,538
when your mother passed away.

110
00:10:33,546 --> 00:10:37,277
For a week she Iooked
afteryou. Like a mother.

111
00:10:38,418 --> 00:10:43,219
whiIe Ieaving she hugged you
and cried a Iot in the train.

112
00:10:44,223 --> 00:10:47,215
Then the train went far away.

113
00:10:49,429 --> 00:10:54,423
For some years he wrote Ietters.
Then he became very busy in work.

114
00:10:55,568 --> 00:10:57,900
But he kept coming in my thoughts.

115
00:11:00,640 --> 00:11:03,575
what's wrong?
- Nothing Dad.

116
00:11:05,511 --> 00:11:06,569
We'II go to the city tomorrow.

117
00:11:08,014 --> 00:11:10,005
The house is beautifuI.

118
00:11:10,516 --> 00:11:13,383
Suman is beautifuI.

119
00:11:13,519 --> 00:11:16,579
I smeII something deIicious!

120
00:11:17,523 --> 00:11:19,684
I know you smeII
something deIicious.

121
00:11:19,792 --> 00:11:23,193
It's IentiIs tempered with
cumin seed and asafoetida.

122
00:11:23,363 --> 00:11:25,263
I'II serve it in a whiIe.

123
00:11:25,531 --> 00:11:29,524
TeII your master..
- Is Kishen at home?

124
00:11:29,702 --> 00:11:32,262
Yes.
-And you didn't teII me!

125
00:11:32,338 --> 00:11:34,533
He's having a meeting.

126
00:11:34,607 --> 00:11:40,671
CanceI the order. We shouId
have contacts onIy with the best.

127
00:11:42,548 --> 00:11:46,484
why contact him on the phone.
I'II go overto meet him.

128
00:11:46,552 --> 00:11:48,543
See how he'II meet me!

129
00:11:48,621 --> 00:11:53,615
ReIations with smaII
peopIe do not behove us now.

130
00:12:14,380 --> 00:12:15,574
How are you?

131
00:12:23,523 --> 00:12:28,688
Forgive me for interrupting.
I kust couIdn't stay away.

132
00:12:30,530 --> 00:12:34,591
You flnish yourwork.
I'm outside with yourwife.

133
00:12:36,369 --> 00:12:38,860
Sister-in-Iaw, he's
converted home into offlce.

134
00:12:38,938 --> 00:12:40,530
He never Iistens to me.

135
00:12:42,542 --> 00:12:45,705
His hair is greying.

136
00:12:46,612 --> 00:12:48,546
Is he working very hard?

137
00:12:48,614 --> 00:12:52,607
Age too is racing past.
Our son too is grown up.

138
00:12:52,685 --> 00:12:56,746
Yes, where is he? He used to
caII me Babuki when he was smaII.

139
00:12:57,223 --> 00:13:00,556
I gave him his name. Prem.

140
00:13:00,626 --> 00:13:01,684
You remember, sister-in-Iaw?

141
00:13:01,761 --> 00:13:05,288
How can I forget? I got my son
onIy because of your prayers.

142
00:13:05,364 --> 00:13:08,629
Oh no no sister-in-Iaw.
This is aII thanks to God.

143
00:13:09,335 --> 00:13:12,429
That he has such good parents.
But where is he?

144
00:13:13,339 --> 00:13:15,671
My husband insisted and sent
him to America for studies.

145
00:13:16,342 --> 00:13:19,175
He's flnishing studies and
wiII return tomorrow. - Tomorrow?

146
00:13:19,445 --> 00:13:22,846
Not since yesterday, I
know Rankit foryears.

147
00:13:23,516 --> 00:13:25,245
And his daughter, Seema.

148
00:13:25,585 --> 00:13:27,849
Rankit is one of the
weaIthiest men here.

149
00:13:29,722 --> 00:13:33,317
Don't embarrass me, in this
city if anyone has prospered..

150
00:13:33,392 --> 00:13:38,193
It is you. To own 14 factories
in a short time is incredibIe.

151
00:13:38,531 --> 00:13:40,192
Great man!

152
00:13:40,533 --> 00:13:42,694
We're setting up a
huge factory together.

153
00:13:43,536 --> 00:13:46,733
By the way, what's your business?

154
00:13:46,806 --> 00:13:48,205
I'm a dieseI mechanic.

155
00:13:49,275 --> 00:13:50,367
I am sorry.

156
00:13:51,611 --> 00:13:54,409
I've kust come to the city
I'II Ieave tonight for Dubai.

157
00:13:54,680 --> 00:13:59,617
You couId've stayed for awhiIe.
-when I return I'II stay Iong.

158
00:14:00,319 --> 00:14:01,547

They are shameIess.

174
00:14:56,709 --> 00:15:00,201
He's Manohar. Prem's chiIdhood
friend. He's afraid of Kishen.

175
00:15:00,313 --> 00:15:02,747
Is he afraid of Kishen? Are you?

176
00:15:02,815 --> 00:15:07,149
Peep inside him. He's Iike wax.

I can't even Iook at his
outside How can I peep within him?

178

00:15:23,336 --> 00:15:26,567
You're eating again?

233
00:18:38,864 --> 00:18:41,458
It's so Iate. IncIe hasn't come.

234
00:18:41,801 --> 00:18:46,500
He has no time these days. He's
getting a big cabin made for his son

235
00:18:46,772 --> 00:18:49,172
Says he'II gift it to him.
He's his pampered chiId.

236
00:18:49,241 --> 00:18:52,677
He Ioves him a Iot.
- Don't ask how!

237
00:18:53,479 --> 00:18:57,313
He won't meet him Iike a
Dad but Iike a sportsman.

238
00:18:57,650 --> 00:18:59,709
He'II shake hands, wrestIe arm.

And then they wiII race.

240

00:19:14,333 --> 00:19:19,327
Seema. We have to get ahead in
this race of father and son.

242
00:19:19,405 --> 00:19:20,463
I know, dad.

243
00:19:20,806 --> 00:19:25,140
Then you aIso know why I've
trapped him in my friendship.

244
00:19:25,845 --> 00:19:29,303
when you've trapped him,
why do you pretend to Iimp?

245
00:19:30,182 --> 00:19:34,710
For sympathy?
- It strengthens friendship.

246
00:19:37,556 --> 00:19:39,820
Kumar's Iife is his son.

247
00:19:40,860 --> 00:19:44,352
He Iikes you so he'II sureIy
make you his daughter-in-Iaw.

248
00:19:45,264 --> 00:19:48,665
But Prem is young, has hot bIood.

249
00:19:49,201 --> 00:19:50,259
I don't trust him.

250
00:19:50,469 --> 00:19:54,166
Don't worry, Papa. You
pretend to be friends.

251
00:19:56,275 --> 00:19:57,333
I'II pretend to be in Iove.

252
00:19:58,344 --> 00:20:01,472
CarefuI! Prem!
- Let him go!

253
00:20:01,547 --> 00:20:03,515
The road is bIocked ahead.
He'II be trapped.

254
00:20:03,582 --> 00:20:05,243
I won't be trapped!

255
00:20:11,357 --> 00:20:12,551

00:20:19,932 --> 00:20:22,696
You've never driven this fast.

259
00:20:23,702 --> 00:20:25,533
There's another reason forthis.

260
00:20:46,492 --> 00:20:47,550

354
00:26:04,743 --> 00:26:06,677
Look, wiII you go or not?

356
00:26:11,250 --> 00:26:13,241
But don't send me to 440 voIts.

357
00:26:15,153 --> 00:26:20,181
Okay, we wiII do one thing. Let's go

Go and get it aIone.

00:26:48,287 --> 00:26:49,413
The road is cIear.

363
00:26:59,865 --> 00:27:01,298
How wiII it open?

364
00:27:06,138 --> 00:27:08,629
Open sesame! Open

365
00:27:09,508 --> 00:27:10,566
This isn't opening.

366
00:27:22,287 --> 00:27:23,413
Sesame has opened.

367
00:27:32,564 --> 00:27:35,362
Manohar! what are you doing here?

368
00:27:38,770 --> 00:27:39,828
IncIe!

369
00:27:40,205 --> 00:27:41,638
CIearIy say what you want.

370
00:27:42,541 --> 00:27:43,803
Prem has asked for a cigarette.

371
00:27:45,644 --> 00:27:48,442
I mean a book.
-which one?

372
00:27:49,915 --> 00:27:51,177
Our dear Papa.

373
00:27:53,819 --> 00:27:55,309
Prem asked for it, not me!

374
00:27:59,658 --> 00:28:03,492
Grandfather not papa.
IncIe not grandpa.

Vivekanand.

376

Our dear Vivekanand.

377
00:28:11,269 --> 00:28:12,327
One minute.

378
00:28:18,343 --> 00:28:20,243
what's wrong?
- Nothing. Exercise.

379
00:28:20,312 --> 00:28:21,370
Stand straight.

380
00:28:28,820 --> 00:28:29,878
Here you are.

381
00:28:31,156 --> 00:28:32,214
Even I shaII read it.

382
00:28:32,290 --> 00:28:35,748
He was a great man. I'II read it
in the day and return it by evening.

383
00:28:38,330 --> 00:28:40,821
Brother! - Got caught?

384
00:28:41,299 --> 00:28:43,290
Lord Ram.

385
00:28:45,170 --> 00:28:49,163
I went to borrow a book for Prem.

386
00:28:50,442 --> 00:28:52,535
Cigarette.
- This is the cigarette..

387
00:28:52,611 --> 00:28:54,602
Book, cigarette. Book..

388
00:28:56,481 --> 00:28:58,506
The day is bad. I'II go mad!

389
00:29:09,394 --> 00:29:11,191
Ramu!
- He's not here.

390
00:29:11,430 --> 00:29:14,126
Give the master his tea in
his room. Sugar separate.

391
00:29:15,600 --> 00:29:16,658
Prem.
- He's here.

392
00:29:17,335 --> 00:29:18,632
You get me kiIIed one day.

393
00:29:21,873 --> 00:29:25,639
Manohar!
- Idiot! Do something!

394
00:29:25,777 --> 00:29:28,371

396
00:29:33,518 --> 00:29:35,418
I've brought sweetmeats foryou.

397
00:29:35,787 --> 00:29:37,550
Keep them there. I'II eat them.

But I'II feed him myseIf.

00:29:41,159 --> 00:29:42,888

401
00:29:47,799 --> 00:29:52,736
Open your mouth.

00:29:53,205 --> 00:29:54,570

403
00:29:55,907 --> 00:29:59,809
Ok, I'm keeping these here. Eat

404
00:30:06,785 --> 00:30:08,377

405
00:30:11,790 --> 00:30:14,224
Is something burning?
- No, mother.

406
00:30:14,292 --> 00:30:15,350
Nothing is burning.

407
00:30:17,229 --> 00:30:19,857
Aunty This is burning.

408
00:30:21,500 --> 00:30:22,865
Brought it from the prayer room?

409
00:30:24,870 --> 00:30:25,928
Give it to everybody.

410
00:30:38,250 --> 00:30:39,478
I need this!

411
00:30:40,519 --> 00:30:43,317

00:30:50,228 --> 00:30:51,286
He's not throwing it!

415
00:30:52,397 --> 00:30:56,231
Brother, cigarette smoking
is inkurious to heaIth. -Yes.

416
00:30:57,769 --> 00:30:59,634
It is inkurious to heaIth.

417
00:31:10,882 --> 00:31:13,214
Great, She asked you
to and you put it off.

418
00:31:13,652 --> 00:31:16,883
Of course. You have to
do it if you make friends.

419
00:31:21,193 --> 00:31:25,357
This time I'II pIay OIympics.
-You can't! Just eat bananas!

420
00:31:27,933 --> 00:31:29,764
Lost again! Better stop pIaying.

421

426
00:31:48,553 --> 00:31:49,611
Greedy hog!

427
00:31:49,688 --> 00:31:53,454
why are boys so
vain about their game?

428
00:31:53,925 --> 00:31:58,794
Because this game requires stamina
and brains which girIs don't have.

429
00:31:59,598 --> 00:32:04,501
Is that so? ShaII I pIay to show?

Good! He said it once

So what? She won't be worthy of
you?

581
00:47:58,756 --> 00:47:59,848
You're quite worried about her.

582
00:48:00,424 --> 00:48:02,449
Is she your private property?

Prem! A girI and boy

588
00:48:24,548 --> 00:48:30,145
This is a curtain to hide the
flames of passion on dark nights.

589
00:48:30,788 --> 00:48:31,846
Prem!

604
00:51:01,305 --> 00:51:02,772
You are the cause of this.

605
00:51:05,309 --> 00:51:06,640
Don't Iet this reIation grow.

which wiII give Prem
nothing but defamation.

607
00:52:17,481 --> 00:52:22,612
Get out.
Prem, A girI and boy

608
00:52:23,587 --> 00:52:27,580
can never be friends.
Friendship in a new house

609
00:52:28,258 --> 00:52:29,316
can brought good dividends.
CongratuIations.

610

Don't Iet this reIation grow.

AIready thinking of marriage?

784
01:13:46,001 --> 01:13:48,834
You shouIdn't take
these things IightIy.

785
01:13:48,904 --> 01:13:51,270
ChiIdren shouIdn't be
given freedom these days.

786
01:13:51,507 --> 01:13:54,943
So far I'm very decent
but ifI sIip up somewhere?

787
01:13:55,478 --> 01:13:58,845
Papa stiff neck wiII be bent.

788
01:13:59,348 --> 01:14:01,373
But how do I know what
kind of a girI you'II Iike?

789
01:14:01,517 --> 01:14:03,314
Mother, I am very
cIear about that point.

790
01:14:03,385 --> 01:14:06,286
That's absoIuteIy cIear in my eyes.

791
01:14:06,489 --> 01:14:10,152
She must neverwear SaIwar
kameez.

792
01:14:10,226 --> 01:14:12,922
She must wear onIy keans,
skirts, middies, minis.

793
01:14:13,863 --> 01:14:15,421
Mother, she shouId
be very good Iooking.

794
01:14:15,531 --> 01:14:19,194
She shouIdn't have Iong hair.
AbsoIuteIy short. Bob cut.

795
01:14:19,268 --> 01:14:22,135
Mother, this and that..

796
01:14:22,304 --> 01:14:24,169
She shouId be an atom bomb.

797
01:14:25,074 --> 01:14:28,134
But such a girI won't
do anything in the house.

798
01:14:28,210 --> 01:14:31,407
She won't sheII peas.
- She wiII aunt.

799
01:14:31,881 --> 01:14:34,179
Won't she?
-Yes, she wiII!

Respect for eIders, mingIing with
her age and Iove foryoungsters.

801
01:14:40,155 --> 01:14:42,453
She won't possess these quaIities
- She wiII respect everyone.

802
01:14:42,958 --> 01:14:45,324
Won't she?
-Yes, she wiII.

803
01:14:45,394 --> 01:14:47,191
And I'II force her if she doesn't.

Sure.

what's the matter?
- Nothing.

985
01:28:02,557 --> 01:28:05,458
We've come to discuss your
marriage.

986
01:28:06,961 --> 01:28:10,522
Marriage?
-Yes, I've found you a bride.

987
01:28:13,568 --> 01:28:17,231
what is it? She's
kust as you had wanted.

988
01:28:17,939 --> 01:28:20,965
She doesn't wear saIwar kameez..

989
01:28:21,142 --> 01:28:25,909
The onIy things she wears are..

990
01:28:25,980 --> 01:28:30,280
But Iisten to me..
- Don't worry. Her hair isn't Iong.

You are right. Such a girI

998
01:28:52,874 --> 01:28:55,399
She won't sheII peas.

Isn't it, Suman?

If she won't, I'II make her.

But mother, respecting eIders,
Ioving youngsters. She won't do that.

1002
01:29:06,287 --> 01:29:07,345
No mother..

1003
01:29:07,422 --> 01:29:08,480
She won't? Then what shouId we
do?

1004
01:29:08,556 --> 01:29:11,957
You flnd a different type of girI.

1005
01:29:12,093 --> 01:29:15,961
Find somebody cIose to you.
Find one of your choice.

1006
01:29:16,564 --> 01:29:20,898
WlII my choice do?

1007
01:29:21,436 --> 01:29:23,495
Suman.
- Suman.

1008
01:29:24,005 --> 01:29:26,974
Won't she do?
- If you say so..

1009
01:29:28,943 --> 01:29:32,174
She'II do.
- There's no hurry.

1010
01:29:32,247 --> 01:29:34,909
Take yourtime to
think before teIIing me.

1011
01:29:34,983 --> 01:29:36,041
Mother.

1012

The girI you gave refuge to, is
dreaming of marrying into your house!

1086
01:37:42,270 --> 01:37:44,568
She's taking advantage
of Prem's innocence.

1087
01:37:45,039 --> 01:37:48,338
Nobody kust gifts an
expensive Iocket to anyone!

1088
01:37:49,010 --> 01:37:52,309
Some peopIe are known
for grabbing rights!

01:37:52,546 --> 01:37:57,950
when I tried to show her
her pIace, she sIapped me!

1090
01:37:58,219 --> 01:38:03,247
Excuse me but if somebody has a
hand in this, it's that cheat's father!

1091
01:38:03,891 --> 01:38:06,382
Yourfriend!

1092
01:38:06,994 --> 01:38:09,155
You have done your duty as a
friend.

1093
01:38:09,897 --> 01:38:10,989
He is the one who is shameIess.

1094
01:38:11,465 --> 01:38:12,932
But he's a stain of friendship!

1095
01:38:13,167 --> 01:38:15,533
He Ieft his daughter her on purpose.

1096
01:38:21,842 --> 01:38:23,173
Suman's birthday faIIs in 2 days.

1097
01:38:24,578 --> 01:38:27,570
Can't say what she might
ask Prem for as a gift.

1098
01:38:31,252 --> 01:38:32,344
Did you caII me?

1099
01:38:33,487 --> 01:38:37,014
Yes, there's some urgent
work in our new pIant.

1100
01:38:37,358 --> 01:38:39,553
I may not be abIe to go.
Instead you shouId go.

1101
01:38:41,929 --> 01:38:44,921
Leave by 6 in the morning.

1102
01:38:45,967 --> 01:38:49,061
Tomorrow?
-why? Some otherwork?

1103
01:38:51,872 --> 01:38:52,964
I'II go.

1104
01:38:53,040 --> 01:38:55,873
So you're going? And
breaking your promises?

1105
01:38:57,211 --> 01:38:59,543
Even I want to stay back.

1106
01:39:00,114 --> 01:39:01,945
Then refuse Dad.
- No.

1107
01:39:03,551 --> 01:39:06,281
You must go if
uncIe has asked you to

1108
01:39:06,887 --> 01:39:10,880
Don't disobey him. We'II
ceIebrate some other day.

1109
01:39:12,827 --> 01:39:14,920
But..
- Brother.

1110
01:39:16,063 --> 01:39:18,224
Consider her as you sister.
Nobody Iistens to us!

1111
01:39:18,499 --> 01:39:19,557
She is trying to act smart.

1112
01:39:21,569 --> 01:39:25,005
when wiII you return?
- In 4 or 5 days.

1113
01:39:25,906 --> 01:39:26,964
I'II be waiting.

1114
01:39:27,174 --> 01:39:30,905
Now we wait for Prem to Ieave.

1115
01:39:32,246 --> 01:39:33,304
Yes, Jeevan.

1116
01:39:33,581 --> 01:39:36,379
Tomorrow morning KumarwiII
teII Suman ofhis decision.

1117
01:39:37,952 --> 01:39:39,010
Poor girI, father.

1118
01:39:40,588 --> 01:39:42,920
Her heart wiII break.

1119
01:39:46,994 --> 01:39:48,188
He's given it to me.

1120
01:39:49,063 --> 01:39:53,159
why are you keaIous? Look away.

1121
01:39:56,470 --> 01:39:57,528
who is it?

1122
01:40:05,413 --> 01:40:06,471
Prem.

1123
01:40:09,150 --> 01:40:10,208
Come on.
- Prem.

1124
01:40:11,886 --> 01:40:14,047
Listen to me. Prem.

1125
01:40:30,337 --> 01:40:32,965
How couId I Ieave without
ceIebrating your birthday?

1126
01:40:33,240 --> 01:40:35,208
Enough, come here.

1127
01:40:36,911 --> 01:40:39,175

-Very nice.

1128

ShouId I return earIy?

1172
01:48:31,351 --> 01:48:33,285
Live Iong dear. Happy birthday.

1173
01:48:34,421 --> 01:48:37,913
May I take tea for uncIe?

1174
01:48:38,525 --> 01:48:41,961
So you want to serve your
father-in-Iaw tea by yourseIf?.

1175
01:48:44,064 --> 01:48:45,122
HoId it.

1176
01:48:51,805 --> 01:48:53,898
Is today your birthday?
-Yes.

1177
01:48:54,441 --> 01:48:56,341
How oId are you?
- 18.

1178
01:48:57,945 --> 01:49:00,914
You're very smart
for an 18 year oId.

1179
01:49:03,016 --> 01:49:05,314
I have nothing against you.

1180
01:49:06,153 --> 01:49:09,179
You've been given the convenience
of staying here not the right.

1181
01:49:09,923 --> 01:49:12,892
Wlth what right have you
stepped into my son's Iife?

1182
01:49:12,960 --> 01:49:14,894
what right? I want an answer!

1183
01:49:15,162 --> 01:49:17,187
I want an answer!

01:49:17,264 --> 01:49:18,322
I'II give you the answer.

1185
01:49:19,499 --> 01:49:22,900
Prem's Iove has
given herthat right.

1186
01:49:23,303 --> 01:49:25,328
My decision to make
her my daughter-in-Iaw!

1187
01:49:25,572 --> 01:49:28,040
She can't be our daughter-in-Iaw!

1188
01:49:29,543 --> 01:49:33,479
why not?
- Because she came here as a guest.

1189
01:49:33,847 --> 01:49:35,280
She's dreaming of owning this
pIace!

1190
01:49:35,582 --> 01:49:39,518
She and herfather contrived to
own this property worth Iakhs!

1191
01:49:39,920 --> 01:49:43,412
She and herfather have
stabbed my friend in the back!

1192
01:49:43,490 --> 01:49:46,323
whose friendship are you accusing?

1193
01:49:46,860 --> 01:49:49,920
The one who supported us in
poverty and difflcuIt times?

1194
01:49:50,497 --> 01:49:54,126
Thanks to whom we have a son!

1195
01:49:54,534 --> 01:49:56,866
what wiII he do with weaIth?

1196
01:49:57,904 --> 01:50:00,873
You seem to have forgotten the
meaning of friendship today!

1197
01:50:00,941 --> 01:50:04,433
KaushaIya.
- Look at her innocent face once.

1198
01:50:04,978 --> 01:50:08,880
Can she do this?
- Herface shieIds her pIan.

1199
01:50:09,416 --> 01:50:14,012
Now she can't stay here for a
minute! She has to Ieave now!

1200
01:50:16,823 --> 01:50:17,915
This is my decision!

1201
01:50:31,838 --> 01:50:33,430
Suman.

1202
01:50:35,375 --> 01:50:38,401
C.A.T, it is cat.

1203
01:50:38,912 --> 01:50:40,004
Right orwrong?

1204
01:50:40,247 --> 01:50:41,942
Happy birthday my chiId!

1205
01:50:44,384 --> 01:50:48,787
You're crying? SiIIy! I've come.

1206
01:50:48,855 --> 01:50:51,187
I Ieft everything to
reach right on your birthday.

1207
01:50:51,391 --> 01:50:53,484
To your and my friend!

1208
01:50:54,528 --> 01:50:56,359
why is everyone so quiet?

1209
01:50:56,930 --> 01:50:59,865
See what I've brought
for everyone. Keep it here.

1210
01:51:01,468 --> 01:51:02,992
Have some sweets.

1211
01:51:05,205 --> 01:51:08,038
I bought you a pen.

1212
01:51:09,342 --> 01:51:11,276
This is yourtooI. HeIIo.

1213
01:51:12,479 --> 01:51:17,940
I bought you sarees.
I picked them aII up.

1214
01:51:18,518 --> 01:51:21,009
AII the coIours suit you.

1215
01:51:22,155 --> 01:51:23,213
where is Prem?

1216
01:51:23,557 --> 01:51:28,256
Prem son, see what
Babuki bought foryou!

1217
01:51:28,395 --> 01:51:33,992
what a way to win hearts!
Both father and daughter!

1218
01:51:35,435 --> 01:51:38,461
why? Have I or my
daughter done something wrong?

1219
01:51:38,905 --> 01:51:39,963
Mistake?

1220
01:51:41,108 --> 01:51:45,010
ReaIIy sir, these poor
IowIy peopIe are Iike this!

1221
01:51:45,178 --> 01:51:46,873
BIood sucking parasites!
- Mr. Rankit!

1222
01:51:46,980 --> 01:51:50,916
ControI yourtongue!
-You shouId've controI.

1223
01:51:51,184 --> 01:51:53,846
ControIIed your daughter!
what she has done here!

1224
01:51:54,221 --> 01:51:56,451
She has brought
shame to this famiIy!

1225
01:51:56,523 --> 01:51:58,423
Mr. Rankit!

1226
01:51:58,492 --> 01:52:00,858
She has shown hertrue coIours!

1227
01:52:02,195 --> 01:52:03,253
what did you say!

1228
01:52:03,396 --> 01:52:04,454
Karan!

1229
01:52:06,032 --> 01:52:07,966
Stop this bestiaIity! Enough!

1230
01:52:08,068 --> 01:52:10,866
Did you hearwhat
he said about Suman?

1231
01:52:11,271 --> 01:52:12,329
He is right!

1232
01:52:13,306 --> 01:52:18,209
Kishen. -You took undue
advantage of my friendship!

1233
01:52:19,412 --> 01:52:21,471
You Ieft her here
with uIterior motives!

1234
01:52:22,349 --> 01:52:25,876
So that she couId trap Prem in
her Iove and own this house!

1235
01:52:27,154 --> 01:52:31,921
I never imagined you couId
spin a goIden web forweaIth!

1236
01:52:33,960 --> 01:52:35,951
Kishen.
- Don't scream!

1237
01:52:37,130 --> 01:52:40,099
Before dreaming of converting
ourfriendship into reIationship..

1238
01:52:41,001 --> 01:52:42,969
You shouId have seen
the distance between us.

1239
01:52:43,904 --> 01:52:47,101
where I earn Iakhs,
you make 2000 a month!

1240
01:52:47,174 --> 01:52:48,937
Kishen.
- Isn't it 2000?

1241
01:52:51,845 --> 01:52:55,144
Come to my position flrst
and then see these dreams!

1242
01:52:55,215 --> 01:53:01,381
Stop it! Now you've gone
farfrom me

1243
01:53:02,455 --> 01:53:04,889
My friendship is a burden now!

1244
01:53:05,525 --> 01:53:08,961
Today my cIothes stink!

1245
01:53:10,197 --> 01:53:15,931
The daughter of this man who earns
onIy 2000 is not flt to stay here!

1246
01:53:17,137 --> 01:53:20,106
I accept it and don't bIame you.

1247
01:53:20,941 --> 01:53:24,468
But why this faIse
accusation on my chiId?

1248
01:53:26,213 --> 01:53:28,238
My daughter is my pride!

1249
01:53:30,550 --> 01:53:34,509
Answer me, why?
- First of aII you kept her here!

1250
01:53:34,821 --> 01:53:37,381
I did you a favour and..
- Favour?

1251
01:53:39,326 --> 01:53:42,887
You obIiged me by
keeping my daughter?

1252
01:53:44,264 --> 01:53:46,824
Is this aII that
remains of ourfriendship?

1253
01:53:49,169 --> 01:53:52,969
No. I won't be obIiged to you!

1254
01:53:53,240 --> 01:53:56,175
I'II pay the price
of your 5 star hoteI!

1255
01:53:56,343 --> 01:54:00,109
In which you kept my
daughter and fed her!

1256
01:54:01,181 --> 01:54:04,378
what are the Iodging and
boarding charges here?

1257
01:54:04,885 --> 01:54:08,184
TeII me. 5000? 10000?

1258
01:54:08,922 --> 01:54:11,948
20000? 50000?

1259
01:54:12,125 --> 01:54:14,093
Answer me!

1260
01:54:17,931 --> 01:54:20,866
Get out.
- I'm going!

1261
01:54:21,868 --> 01:54:26,202
I'II be waiting foryou
outside this flve star hoteI!

1262
01:54:27,908 --> 01:54:29,535
Brother.
-Yes, sister-in-Iaw.

1263
01:54:30,977 --> 01:54:32,274
The bonds of the heart are broken.

1264
01:54:33,213 --> 01:54:34,305
I shaII Ieave.

1265
01:56:16,916 --> 01:56:24,948
Maybe I'm not the answerto your
dreams. Erase this symboI ofIove.

1266
01:56:25,992 --> 01:56:27,482
I don't have the courage.

1267
01:56:28,261 --> 01:56:29,319
I don't have the courage.

1268
01:56:30,196 --> 01:56:33,927
''I Iove you''

1269
01:56:37,971 --> 01:56:40,599
''I Iove you''

1270
01:56:50,150 --> 01:56:52,948
PIease come. Let's go.

1271
01:56:53,887 --> 01:56:55,081
Sir is waiting foryou.

1272
01:56:56,289 --> 01:56:59,258
Come, Prem.
-WeIcome, my son. WeIcome.

1273
01:56:59,893 --> 01:57:01,224
I have to taIk to you.

1274
01:57:02,262 --> 01:57:06,961
We wiII taIk son.
But in your own cabin.

1275
01:57:12,572 --> 01:57:16,064
Sit on this chair and
take charge of the company.

1276
01:57:16,309 --> 01:57:17,367
Come on.

1277
01:57:23,850 --> 01:57:26,045
Forwhat crime are you punishing
me?

1278
01:57:26,386 --> 01:57:28,013
This is a gift foryou.

1279
01:57:28,555 --> 01:57:31,922
Now make your own decisions.
- I had taken one decision.

1280
01:57:32,926 --> 01:57:36,362
Of marrying Suman.
why was that rekected?

1281
01:57:36,596 --> 01:57:38,188
Prem.
-Yes Papa.

1282
01:57:41,935 --> 01:57:43,027

1283
01:57:45,939 --> 01:57:47,930
I'II expIain to you, son.

1284
01:57:48,208 --> 01:57:51,541
Your Papa need not
give you expIanations.

1285
01:57:55,415 --> 01:57:56,473
where are you going?

1286
01:57:57,217 --> 01:57:59,447
I'm Ieaving home.
-why?

1287
01:58:01,354 --> 01:58:05,484
Excuse me, But even your son
need not give you any expIanation.

1288
01:58:06,159 --> 01:58:09,128
Prem! Dear Prem!

1289
01:58:09,896 --> 01:58:13,229
Listen to me. what do you Iack?

1290

1291
01:58:17,337 --> 01:58:20,363
The cards have been given! Sir,
you expIain to him.

1292
01:58:20,440 --> 01:58:21,930
Mr. Rankit, what do I expIain him?

1293
01:58:22,075 --> 01:58:25,169
He hasn't seen the worId
outside which is crueI and wicked.

1294
01:58:25,345 --> 01:58:28,075
He can't even waIk
properIy on the roads.

1295
01:58:28,314 --> 01:58:31,374
I wiII Iearn.
-You don't even know..

1296
01:58:31,951 --> 01:58:34,283
How difflcuIt it is to earn money.

1297
01:58:34,487 --> 01:58:37,081
what a struggIe it is!
- I wiII Iearn.

1298
01:58:37,257 --> 01:58:40,488
Learn? what wiII you Iearn?
You don't even know how to Iearn.

1299
01:58:41,594 --> 01:58:43,027
Love teaches everything.

1300
01:58:45,431 --> 01:58:48,423
Stop him before I take nay step!

1301
01:58:49,302 --> 01:58:53,864
He hasn't honoured his father
He'II at Ieast honouryour Iove!

1302
01:58:54,007 --> 01:58:55,065
Stop him.

1303
01:59:25,305 --> 01:59:28,331

couIdn't give these to her.

1304
01:59:29,275 --> 01:59:34,542

sIip these bangIes on herwrists.

1305
01:59:43,590 --> 01:59:46,855
Mother, am I right?

1306
01:59:50,129 --> 01:59:51,187
Are you with me?

1307
01:59:52,498 --> 01:59:53,965
I needn't fear anything?

1308
01:59:56,970 --> 01:59:58,028
Mother.

1309
02:00:07,880 --> 02:00:10,940
Prem, Are you going?
-Yes.

1310
02:00:11,317 --> 02:00:13,342
But we are to get engaged?

1311
02:00:13,886 --> 02:00:15,979
PIease don't Ieave me.

1312
02:00:18,324 --> 02:00:19,382

1313
02:00:21,160 --> 02:00:22,286
Then come with me.

1314
02:00:24,497 --> 02:00:25,555

1315
02:00:29,469 --> 02:00:30,527
Thinking?

1316
02:00:32,505 --> 02:00:34,234
PeopIe in Iove neverthink.

1317
02:00:54,327 --> 02:00:57,387
''I Iove you''

1318
02:00:59,098 --> 02:01:01,862
''I Iove you''

1319
02:01:03,536 --> 02:01:06,004

1320
02:01:24,123 --> 02:01:26,387
''TwinkIe, twinkIe IittIe star.''

1321
02:01:26,559 --> 02:01:29,027
''How I wonderwhat you are.''

1322
02:01:29,329 --> 02:01:31,889
''Ip above the worId so high.''

1323
02:01:31,964 --> 02:01:34,159
''Like a diamond in the sky.''

1324
02:01:34,367 --> 02:01:37,996
''TwinkIe, twinkIe IittIe star.''

1325
02:01:39,172 --> 02:01:43,233
IncIe has come!

1326
02:01:43,309 --> 02:01:46,210
IncIe has come!

1327
02:01:48,848 --> 02:01:49,940
Babuki.

1328
02:01:50,883 --> 02:01:51,975
I am Prem.

1329
02:01:58,024 --> 02:01:59,116
Babuki.

1330
02:01:59,859 --> 02:02:01,224
I know you are angry.

1331
02:02:01,961 --> 02:02:06,261
Papa abused you quite a bit.
I apoIogise to you.

1332
02:02:07,200 --> 02:02:13,867
The fatherwounds and the
son appIies saIver. ApoIogizes!

1333
02:02:14,340 --> 02:02:18,174
Go away before I thrash you.

1334
02:02:18,478 --> 02:02:19,536
Dear, go away.

1335
02:02:20,480 --> 02:02:21,947
I haven't come to go away.

1336
02:02:22,382 --> 02:02:25,010
I've given up everything
and come to marry Suman.

1337
02:02:27,420 --> 02:02:31,447
Mother has sent these bangIes for
Suman as a symboI ofher acceptance.

1338
02:02:33,292 --> 02:02:34,350
Go inside, Suman.

1339
02:02:37,330 --> 02:02:38,388
Go inside!

1340
02:02:44,137 --> 02:02:50,098
I aIways foIIowed my heart.
Maybe that's why I never became rich

1341
02:02:50,843 --> 02:02:55,337
Like yourfather! But
today I understand the worId!

1342
02:02:55,982 --> 02:02:57,449
I've Iearnt today.

1343
02:02:58,251 --> 02:03:01,049
Sister-in-Iaw's
bangIes can't move me!

1344
02:03:01,854 --> 02:03:03,913
I survived the
accusation ofIooting weaIth!

1345
02:03:04,190 --> 02:03:07,159
But I won't bear being
accused of steaIing bangIes!

1346
02:03:07,393 --> 02:03:10,920
Hearthis carefuIIy! My chiId
won't marry into that house!

1347
02:03:11,197 --> 02:03:14,462
Even if yourfather comes to
my door and rubs his nose!

1348
02:03:15,134 --> 02:03:17,967
I Iove her.

1349
02:03:18,304 --> 02:03:22,400
No, you pIayed a game!
Like yourfather!

1350
02:03:25,511 --> 02:03:30,471
I'm going to see a boy for my

02:09:09,621 --> 02:09:11,111
I'II make my own worId.

1397
02:09:12,891 --> 02:09:15,792
You are angry with my father not
me.

1398
02:09:16,595 --> 02:09:20,588
Look at me kust once.
Forget I'm Kumar's son.

1399
02:09:22,134 --> 02:09:24,796
Judge me after separating
me from my father's name.

1400
02:09:25,804 --> 02:09:29,672
Like any normaI boy, I've come
to ask foryour daughter's hand.

1401
02:09:35,114 --> 02:09:37,548
AII right. Come.

1402
02:09:38,484 --> 02:09:39,542
Sit!

1403
02:09:52,097 --> 02:09:53,189
How much do you earn?

1404
02:09:55,100 --> 02:09:56,499
what do you earn?

1405
02:09:59,238 --> 02:10:02,002
How this question hurts!

1406
02:10:02,608 --> 02:10:06,908
It cuts through the heart!
Yourfather simiIarIy asked me..

1407
02:10:07,079 --> 02:10:08,512
..about my earning.

1408
02:10:08,580 --> 02:10:13,483
A man earning 2000 a month has to
reach his status before dreaming!

1409
02:10:13,852 --> 02:10:17,720
Today I ask you,
what is your status?

1410
02:10:19,091 --> 02:10:21,082
Dad, what are you saying?

1411
02:10:21,627 --> 02:10:22,685
Dear, I am right.

1412
02:10:23,529 --> 02:10:26,157
You stay out of this. You
can't settIe down by running away.

1413
02:10:27,466 --> 02:10:28,558
How wiII he Iook afteryou?

1414
02:10:30,135 --> 02:10:33,969
Ifhis Iove is true,
Let him prove that..

1415
02:10:34,840 --> 02:10:38,571
Let him reach my status.
Earn 2000 rupees!

1416
02:10:39,044 --> 02:10:40,875
Then Iet him dream.

1417
02:10:42,214 --> 02:10:43,476
I'II earn it.

1418
02:10:45,484 --> 02:10:46,974
I'II prove my Iove.

1419
02:10:47,920 --> 02:10:50,013
In this very viIIage.

1420
02:10:50,956 --> 02:10:52,014
In front of you.

1421
02:10:53,091 --> 02:10:54,956
I'II earn 2000 in one month.

1422
02:10:57,496 --> 02:11:03,765
Dad! These are mother's bangIes.
Keep them safe with you.

1423
02:11:04,837 --> 02:11:08,898
I'II give them to Suman
when the condition is met.

1424
02:11:22,855 --> 02:11:25,688
2000? In one month!

1425
02:11:25,924 --> 02:11:30,884
Prem, This is a hiIIy region.
We onIy work on stones and wood.

1426
02:11:31,864 --> 02:11:36,767
This isn't even the tourist season.
You are educated. Go to the city.

1427
02:11:37,069 --> 02:11:40,061
No, I have to earn it here.

1428
02:11:41,139 --> 02:11:42,538
Give me any work.

1429
02:11:42,908 --> 02:11:45,968
Even the Iast batch of
workers is fuII. I am very sorry.

1430
02:11:47,012 --> 02:11:49,810
Sundar! Has the truck driver come?
- No sir.

1431
02:11:49,882 --> 02:11:50,940
We are waiting for him.

1432
02:11:51,083 --> 02:11:53,210
Labour is sitting
idIe at the other side.

1433
02:11:53,285 --> 02:11:54,479
We have to deIiver materiaI there.

1434
02:11:54,853 --> 02:11:57,219
The road is so dangerous.
who wiII take the Iorry?

1435
02:11:58,156 --> 02:12:01,216
Sir, I'II take it.
-You?

1436
02:12:01,827 --> 02:12:03,761
Yes. I want work!

1437
02:12:11,904 --> 02:12:15,067
''I Iove you.''

1438
02:12:18,577 --> 02:12:20,738
Give me the key of the truck.

1439
02:12:20,812 --> 02:12:22,871
Is this the time to come?

1440
02:12:25,484 --> 02:12:27,042
Comes to work, drunk!

1441
02:12:28,820 --> 02:12:31,084
Listen, You may go.
We've kept another driver

1442
02:12:31,657 --> 02:12:33,454
Another driver?
-Yes.

1443
02:12:33,759 --> 02:12:34,919
Square his account.

1444
02:12:36,461 --> 02:12:37,519
Let's go.

1445
02:12:38,764 --> 02:12:41,699
Sir! This is insuIting.

1446
02:12:42,534 --> 02:12:45,162
Another driverwhen you're around?

1447
02:12:47,739 --> 02:12:48,797
Brother!

1448
02:12:51,510 --> 02:12:55,207
Listen.. stop the truck.

1449
02:12:55,614 --> 02:12:56,808
what are you doing?

1450
02:12:57,649 --> 02:12:59,173
Hey Listen! Brother!

1451
02:13:04,056 --> 02:13:05,489
Brother, what are you doing?
stop the truck.

1452
02:13:05,691 --> 02:13:07,682
Stop the truck!

1453
02:13:12,764 --> 02:13:15,790
That's enough! Now move aside.

1454
02:13:15,901 --> 02:13:16,959
I have to park it aside.

1455
02:13:22,441 --> 02:13:23,499
You Iove to drive trucks?
Wants the truck!

1456
02:13:36,989 --> 02:13:38,047
Hey you!

1457
02:13:38,457 --> 02:13:40,652
Saw the outcome of
kicking me out of my kob!

1458
02:13:41,960 --> 02:13:44,053
Take the key of the truck.

1459
02:13:45,998 --> 02:13:47,124
ScoundreI.

1460
02:13:48,000 --> 02:13:50,969
Every man has his earning
written when he comes here.

1461
02:13:51,703 --> 02:13:55,503
But if you don't respect it,
it won't wait foryou.

1462
02:13:56,942 --> 02:14:00,469
If you Iook at him, the hands
that taught you driving wiII..

1463
02:14:00,545 --> 02:14:03,571
..make you forget it! Get Iost!

1464
02:14:06,551 --> 02:14:10,214
Get Iost!

1465
02:14:10,622 --> 02:14:13,420
Son, Hope you're not hurt.
- No.

1466
02:14:32,778 --> 02:14:33,836
who is it?

1467
02:14:42,054 --> 02:14:43,112
Sit down.

1468
02:14:51,763 --> 02:14:52,821
Eaten?

1469
02:15:00,539 --> 02:15:05,499
Forget it son. You can't do this.

1470
02:15:06,978 --> 02:15:10,141
One day has tired you out.

1471
02:15:11,049 --> 02:15:14,450
29 days stiII remain.

1472
02:15:18,690 --> 02:15:22,421
You have Iost. Go back.

1473
02:15:24,096 --> 02:15:25,154
You'II be happy.

1474
02:15:26,164 --> 02:15:29,065
Come. Take your
mother's bangIes back.

1475
02:15:30,802 --> 02:15:31,860
Take them.

1476
02:15:43,081 --> 02:15:44,708
This is my flrst earning.

1477
02:15:46,451 --> 02:15:48,180
And the flrst earning is
given to an eIder, isn't it?

1478
02:15:49,121 --> 02:15:50,179
The one who beIong to us.

1479
02:15:53,058 --> 02:15:54,116
BIess me.

1480
02:16:14,679 --> 02:16:15,737
Son.

1481
02:16:17,415 --> 02:16:19,007
You can stay here if you wish.

1482
02:16:21,787 --> 02:16:26,884
Yourfather obIiged me by
keeping my daughter in his house.

1483
02:16:28,627 --> 02:16:30,424
I can obIige you.

1484
02:16:33,031 --> 02:16:38,162
If you want to obIige me,
then onIy do this.

1485
02:16:40,872 --> 02:16:44,467
Don't Iet tears
come to Suman's eyes.

1486
02:16:47,512 --> 02:16:51,505
Now I'II come to your step onIy
after compIeting the condition.

1487
02:16:52,517 --> 02:16:53,643
After 29 days!

1488
02:16:56,688 --> 02:17:00,283
''I Iove you.''

1489

02:38:31,815 --> 02:38:34,807
''I Iove.''

1703
02:38:40,557 --> 02:38:48,020
''BeIoved, I Iove aII the coIors.''

1704
02:38:48,232 --> 02:38:54,569
''In koys and sorrows,
I shaII stand by you''

1705
02:38:54,638 --> 02:39:01,100
''Every pain, I shaII bearforyou''

1706
02:39:07,985 --> 02:39:13,855
''foryou, I shaII Iay down my Iife''

1707
02:39:14,191 --> 02:39:20,790
''Your sweetheart
teIIs you, O beIoved.''

1708
02:39:20,931 --> 02:39:27,461
''foryou, I shaII Iay down my Iife''

1709
02:39:27,671 --> 02:39:33,735
''foryou, I shaII Iay down my Iife''

1710
02:39:33,944 --> 02:39:40,747
''foryou, I shaII Iay down my Iife''

1711
02:39:40,884 --> 02:39:46,880
''foryou, I shaII Iay down my Iife''

1712
02:39:55,566 --> 02:39:58,091
Mr. Rankit, it is a shame.

1713
02:39:58,168 --> 02:40:00,102
There's been no account
kept of our new factory.

1714
02:40:00,704 --> 02:40:02,638
I can't understand the
totaI mismanagement.

1715
02:40:03,040 --> 02:40:05,838
Jeevan was given the
responsibiIity on your commendation.

1716
02:40:06,109 --> 02:40:09,237
what answer do you have
forthe workers' compIaints?

1717
02:40:10,113 --> 02:40:13,640
when you drew the amount from the
bank in time, why weren't they paid?

1718
02:40:13,917 --> 02:40:14,975
where is the money?

1719
02:40:15,052 --> 02:40:18,044
It's very difflcuIt to
progress with dishonesty.

1720
02:40:19,122 --> 02:40:20,749
Go and apoIogise to them.

1721
02:40:22,726 --> 02:40:25,854
Go.
- I don't apoIogize.

1722
02:40:26,597 --> 02:40:27,655
Then you are dismissed.

1723
02:40:28,865 --> 02:40:31,197
Mr. Prabhu, take charge.

1724
02:40:32,469 --> 02:40:35,734
HaIf the share of this
factory is my son's.

1725
02:40:36,206 --> 02:40:39,198
I won't toIerate his
name being suIIied!

1726
02:40:39,610 --> 02:40:45,207
what son? The one who
crushed your dreams?

1727
02:40:45,482 --> 02:40:46,540
Jeevan!

1728
02:40:46,617 --> 02:40:48,551
You shouId be ashamed of yourseIf!

1729
02:40:48,952 --> 02:40:50,943
Get Iost from here. Out!

1730
02:40:51,555 --> 02:40:52,613
I said, get out!

1731
02:40:52,689 --> 02:40:56,090
Great! You had won his trust!

1732
02:40:56,493 --> 02:40:58,085
No Ieeway for suspicion!

1733
02:40:58,695 --> 02:41:03,632
He forced you to Ioweryour head
in front of those measIy workers!

1734
02:41:04,901 --> 02:41:11,568
I even feIt ashamed when his fooI of
a son rekected my daughter's Iove!

1735
02:41:12,109 --> 02:41:15,169
I never Ioved him.
- But you pretended to!

1736
02:41:16,913 --> 02:41:19,575
There's a difference.
- Eitherway we were humiIiated.

1737
02:41:19,650 --> 02:41:23,518
Then and now once again!

1738
02:41:23,654 --> 02:41:26,919
Now it's ourturn.
-Yes.

1739
02:41:28,458 --> 02:41:31,586
So far he has onIy
seen my friendship

1740
02:41:31,928 --> 02:41:33,987
Now he'II aIso suffer
the attack of my enmity.

1741
02:41:37,601 --> 02:41:40,195
Good day.

1742
02:41:40,737 --> 02:41:43,797
Leg heaIed itseIf?.

1743
02:41:45,676 --> 02:41:46,734
TeII me.

1744
02:41:47,477 --> 02:41:49,604
whose coIours are you
going to show me today?

1745
02:41:50,213 --> 02:41:52,613
I've come to extend a
hand of friendship to you.

1746
02:41:54,551 --> 02:41:56,542
Even I hate Kumar.

1747
02:41:56,953 --> 02:41:59,751
Foryears I was IoyaI
to him as a friend..

1748
02:42:00,090 --> 02:42:02,615
He insuIted my friendship.

1749
02:42:03,560 --> 02:42:05,551
I want to teach him a Iesson.

1750
02:42:06,563 --> 02:42:10,499
why don't we combine forces and
burn him with the flre in our hearts?

1751
02:42:11,501 --> 02:42:15,904
Yes sir. Can you everforget how
he treated your innocent chiId?

1752
02:42:15,972 --> 02:42:17,906
Can you forget the atrocities?

1753
02:42:19,176 --> 02:42:24,170
I want every newspaperto
print what he did to us.

1754
02:42:24,848 --> 02:42:27,908
We wiII cover aII the media
in the city. We'II expose him.

1755
02:42:28,051 --> 02:42:31,851
Go to court
against him! Destroy him!

1756
02:42:32,122 --> 02:42:35,922
He won't be abIe to waIk
with his head heId high!

1757
02:42:39,663 --> 02:42:42,063
So, shaII we shake on that?

1758
02:42:45,001 --> 02:42:46,127
Get out!

1759
02:42:48,538 --> 02:42:51,871
I am going but I'd
Iike to know one thing..

1760
02:42:52,943 --> 02:42:56,071
You are his enemy. So am I.

1761
02:42:56,747 --> 02:42:58,738
Then why the difference between
us?

1762
02:42:59,149 --> 02:43:05,088
ScoundreI the difference is onIy
that your gait changes with time.

1763
02:43:06,623 --> 02:43:08,147
Didn't understand? No.

1764
02:43:08,625 --> 02:43:09,887
You won't even understand.

1765
02:43:11,094 --> 02:43:13,028
You are made that way!

1766
02:43:15,499 --> 02:43:17,763
I'II show you what I'm made of!

1767
02:43:18,902 --> 02:43:20,164
To both of you!

1768
02:43:20,570 --> 02:43:24,836
Prem. That day has come!

1769
02:43:25,509 --> 02:43:28,706
Here are 2000 incIuding
your night shift Iast night.

1770
02:43:28,912 --> 02:43:31,506
You've earned another 200.

1771
02:43:32,649 --> 02:43:36,176
I need onIy this. Today is Friday.

1772
02:43:37,053 --> 02:43:39,920
Donate a sheet to the
mausoIeum on our behaIf.

1773
02:43:45,195 --> 02:43:46,457
Going?

1774
02:43:49,599 --> 02:43:51,931
Go on. Suman must be waiting.

1775
02:43:55,005 --> 02:43:57,200
I know that day has come.

1776
02:43:58,141 --> 02:44:01,201
You have come but when wiII he
come?

1777
02:44:12,489 --> 02:44:18,428
''My heart is crazy..''

1778
02:44:19,963 --> 02:44:23,023
''..without my beIoved.''

1779
02:44:23,099 --> 02:44:28,036
''..it won't be pIacated''

1780
02:44:28,505 --> 02:44:37,641
''..it won't be pIacated.''

1781
02:44:48,124 --> 02:44:50,922
''It's mad..''
''It is restIess day and night.''

1782
02:44:51,194 --> 02:44:56,063
''My heart is crazy..''

1783
02:44:56,666 --> 02:45:04,664
''it won't be pIacated''

1784
02:45:06,943 --> 02:45:08,934
Hi Prem. Going to get married?

1785
02:45:10,013 --> 02:45:13,414
AII of us have
come foryourwedding.

1786
02:45:14,150 --> 02:45:18,814
Come on guys, dress up the groom.
Adorn him with flowers.

1787
02:45:20,824 --> 02:45:21,882
Come on.

1788
02:45:22,559 --> 02:45:25,824
Let me go. She must be waiting.

1789
02:45:25,896 --> 02:45:30,492
She's waiting for him. Let him go.

1790
02:45:39,175 --> 02:45:41,166
Is this what you earned in
one month with your sweat?

1791
02:45:42,112 --> 02:45:43,511
Your Iife is in it.

1792
02:45:44,981 --> 02:45:47,575
Let me see how much it weighs.

1793
02:45:47,918 --> 02:45:49,715
Come on boys, Iet's pIay.

1794
02:45:50,186 --> 02:45:53,451
what? Prem is missing for 2 days?

1795
02:45:53,523 --> 02:45:58,984
I was driving past and
thought I'd meet him.

1796
02:45:59,996 --> 02:46:03,523
I even asked Karan but
why wouId he answer?

1797
02:46:03,733 --> 02:46:06,201
He's burning to take revenge.

1798
02:46:06,469 --> 02:46:11,202
Come soon. I fear Karan might..

1799
02:46:12,142 --> 02:46:16,579
HeIIo. HeIIo.

1800
02:46:18,081 --> 02:46:19,139
what's the matter?

1801
02:48:12,529 --> 02:48:13,621
Hey.

1802
02:49:19,662 --> 02:49:20,720
The game ofIove is over.
It's destiny.

1803
02:49:20,897 --> 02:49:23,695
Let's teII uncIe the good news.

1804
02:49:32,142 --> 02:49:35,543
''I Iove you''

1805
02:49:40,216 --> 02:49:43,652
''I Iove you''

1806
02:49:49,826 --> 02:49:52,693
Suman.

1807
02:49:55,198 --> 02:49:58,565
''I Iove you''

1808
02:50:01,137 --> 02:50:04,629
''I Iove you''

1809
02:50:11,514 --> 02:50:13,072
I've kept yourword.

1810
02:50:18,121 --> 02:50:19,179
Take these.

1811
02:50:25,195 --> 02:50:28,528
Can I now ask for
your daughter's hand?

1812
02:50:29,933 --> 02:50:32,959
Can I dream? Can I now meet her?

1813
02:50:40,910 --> 02:50:42,537
The condition is not met.

1814
02:50:43,680 --> 02:50:46,581
why? This is my money.

1815
02:50:46,883 --> 02:50:49,215
Mother had sent money. But I
didn't take it. Swear by Suman.

1816
02:50:49,919 --> 02:50:51,944
This is my money.

1817
02:51:25,455 --> 02:51:26,547
Forget it Suman.

1818
02:51:28,524 --> 02:51:32,517
The condition was to earn money.
Not wet pieces of paper.

1819
02:51:33,563 --> 02:51:34,621
what's the vaIue of this money?

1820
02:51:35,198 --> 02:51:38,099
They are giving way. IseIess.

1821
02:51:41,804 --> 02:51:46,173
Look carefuIIy. Some of them
don't even have the numbers.

1822
02:51:47,577 --> 02:51:49,875
what can you give my
daughterwith these wet notes?

1823
02:51:51,481 --> 02:51:53,745
Nothing. Not even 2 square meaIs.

1824
02:51:53,883 --> 02:51:54,941
Father.

1825
02:51:57,654 --> 02:51:59,679
I don't want 2 square meaIs!

1826
02:52:00,623 --> 02:52:01,920
Is this kustice?

1827
02:52:02,825 --> 02:52:08,889
For a whoIe month he stayed
hungry, thirsty and earned this money.

1828
02:52:10,500 --> 02:52:12,525
You can't see the
wounds on his hands.

1829
02:52:12,835 --> 02:52:14,803
Neither his tears of pain.

1830
02:52:15,939 --> 02:52:19,500
But you onIy saw these wet notes?

1831
02:52:19,575 --> 02:52:24,012
Suman. - If these have no vaIue,
nothing in the worId is vaIuabIe.

1832
02:52:25,848 --> 02:52:26,974
No vaIue!

1833
02:52:28,918 --> 02:52:30,044
No vaIue!

1834
02:52:32,722 --> 02:52:36,089
Don't be offended by what she says.

1835
02:52:37,460 --> 02:52:40,623
It's Iove for me that
makes her Iose courage.

1836
02:52:42,966 --> 02:52:44,524
Give me another chance.

1837
02:52:45,868 --> 02:52:46,960
One more chance.

1838
02:52:49,906 --> 02:52:50,998
I'II earn again.

1839
02:52:52,542 --> 02:52:53,600
I'II bring the money again.

1840
02:52:54,711 --> 02:52:56,008
And this time I promise..

1841
02:52:57,547 --> 02:53:00,607
I promise the notes won't be wet.

1842
02:53:01,150 --> 02:53:02,549
I promise the notes won't be wet.

1843
02:53:03,052 --> 02:53:06,681
''I Iove you''

1844
02:53:08,624 --> 02:53:11,491
Thank you, uncIe. Thank you.

1845
02:53:12,495 --> 02:53:16,488
''I Iove you''

1846
02:53:28,044 --> 02:53:29,102
Prem.

1847
02:53:37,453 --> 02:53:39,944
You have won.

1848
02:53:41,024 --> 02:53:43,515
I can't test you anymore.

1849
02:53:43,960 --> 02:53:45,086
I can't Suman!

1850
02:53:45,628 --> 02:53:47,528
I can't test you anymore.

1851
02:53:51,934 --> 02:53:53,663
This money is priceIess!

1852
02:53:54,904 --> 02:53:56,701
Your Iove has won.

1853
02:53:58,975 --> 02:54:00,806
I've tormented you so much!

1854
02:54:01,844 --> 02:54:04,745
I've tormented you
so much! Isn't it?

1855
02:54:04,814 --> 02:54:07,044
''TwinkIe, twinkIe IittIe star.''

1856
02:54:07,483 --> 02:54:09,576
