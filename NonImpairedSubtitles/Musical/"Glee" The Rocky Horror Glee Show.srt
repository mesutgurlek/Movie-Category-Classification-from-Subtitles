1
00:00:06,320 --> 00:00:08,860
* Michael Rennie was ill *

2
00:00:08,960 --> 00:00:11,710
* The day the earth stood still *

3
00:00:11,920 --> 00:00:16,140
* But he told us where we stand *

4
00:00:17,110 --> 00:00:19,820
* And Flash Gordon was there *

5
00:00:19,940 --> 00:00:22,500
* In silver underwear *

6
00:00:22,670 --> 00:00:26,700
* Claude rains was
the invisible man *

7
00:00:27,880 --> 00:00:30,470
* Then something went wrong *

8
00:00:30,550 --> 00:00:33,100
* For fay Wray and king Kong *

9
00:00:33,260 --> 00:00:37,560
* They got caught
in a celluloid jam *

10
00:00:38,410 --> 00:00:41,379
* Then at a deadly pace *

11
00:00:41,380 --> 00:00:44,170
* It came from outer space *

12
00:00:44,470 --> 00:00:48,400
* And this is how
the message ran *

13
00:00:51,300 --> 00:00:54,710
* Science fiction *

14
00:00:56,700 --> 00:01:00,150
* Double feature *

15
00:01:05,190 --> 00:01:10,310
* To the late night
double feature *

16
00:01:10,350 --> 00:01:15,080
* Picture show. *

17
00:01:23,150 --> 00:01:25,750
* In the velvet darkness *

18
00:01:25,810 --> 00:01:28,020
* Of the blackest night *

19
00:01:28,270 --> 00:01:31,000
* Burning bright *

20
00:01:31,380 --> 00:01:37,080
* There's a guiding star *

21
00:01:37,470 --> 00:01:40,130
* No matter what *

22
00:01:40,810 --> 00:01:43,190
* Or who *

23
00:01:43,260 --> 00:01:48,640
* Who you are *

24
00:01:49,050 --> 00:01:52,710
* There's a light *

25
00:01:52,930 --> 00:01:57,050
* Over at the frankenstein place *

26
00:01:57,100 --> 00:02:03,480
* There's a light *

27
00:02:03,530 --> 00:02:07,480
* Burning in the fireplace *

28
00:02:07,570 --> 00:02:10,600
* There's a light *

29
00:02:10,710 --> 00:02:16,040
* Light in the darkness *

30
00:02:16,100 --> 00:02:19,870
* Of everybody... *

31
00:02:20,160 --> 00:02:22,529
Schuester, you messing
with my woman?

32
00:02:22,530 --> 00:02:24,060
I... I thought we had a deal.

33
00:02:25,630 --> 00:02:28,510
This is the face of a
guy who stepped in it.

34
00:02:28,580 --> 00:02:29,720
How did it get to this?

35
00:02:29,721 --> 00:02:32,010
How did a production of
Rocky Horror turn into...

36
00:02:33,380 --> 00:02:34,970
Ugh...My horror?

37
00:02:35,150 --> 00:02:36,610
It all started a week ago.

38
00:02:36,820 --> 00:02:37,870
Hey, Em. Hi.

39
00:02:38,010 --> 00:02:40,830
What's with your crusts?

40
00:02:41,050 --> 00:02:42,410
You-you always cut them off.

41
00:02:44,440 --> 00:02:45,962
I must have forgotten
this morning.

42
00:02:46,440 --> 00:02:47,110
Forgot?

43
00:02:48,470 --> 00:02:50,350
Carl and I had the
most amazing weekend.

44
00:02:50,410 --> 00:02:51,570
We hit the revival theater

45
00:02:51,571 --> 00:02:54,780
downtown for the midnight
show of Rocky Horror.

46
00:02:55,900 --> 00:02:56,580
You're kidding.

47
00:02:56,640 --> 00:02:57,490
No.

48
00:02:57,491 --> 00:02:59,720
Isn't that where everyone
dresses up and yells stuff?

49
00:02:59,721 --> 00:03:00,680
Yes, yeah.

50
00:03:00,681 --> 00:03:02,072
I mean, well, we don't dress up.

51
00:03:02,590 --> 00:03:03,700
At least not yet.

52
00:03:05,310 --> 00:03:07,240
Wait, isn't that
theater a total dive?

53
00:03:07,241 --> 00:03:08,430
It's disgusting, it's horrible.

54
00:03:08,431 --> 00:03:09,160
I know. I mean, there isn't

55
00:03:09,161 --> 00:03:10,050
a surface that isn't

56
00:03:10,051 --> 00:03:11,590
covered in spilled soda,
so you'd think

57
00:03:11,591 --> 00:03:12,800
it'd be a nightmare for me, right?

58
00:03:12,801 --> 00:03:14,869
But I don't know,
I'm having so much fun

59
00:03:14,870 --> 00:03:16,140
that I don't even notice.

60
00:03:23,330 --> 00:03:24,540
Mm. And get this.

61
00:03:24,541 --> 00:03:25,560
You know how I've always been

62
00:03:25,561 --> 00:03:26,600
very anti-Halloween

63
00:03:26,601 --> 00:03:28,770
'cause it totally freaks me out
to think about eating candy

64
00:03:28,771 --> 00:03:30,139
that someone else
has touched, right?

65
00:03:30,140 --> 00:03:33,529
Well, Carl and I are gonna
dress up as characters

66
00:03:33,530 --> 00:03:35,520
from the show,
and we're actually gonna

67
00:03:35,521 --> 00:03:36,440
go trick-or-treating!

68
00:03:36,570 --> 00:03:37,700
The sandwich,

69
00:03:37,890 --> 00:03:41,000
the dirty theater...
he's actually making her better.

70
00:03:41,001 --> 00:03:42,260
...Go as Janet, because obviously,

71
00:03:42,261 --> 00:03:44,050
she's a ginger... he's winning.

72
00:03:44,400 --> 00:03:47,009
Why the hell didn't I think of
taking her to that damn show?

73
00:03:47,270 --> 00:03:49,429
Oh, it's so weird

74
00:03:49,430 --> 00:03:50,990
that you brought up how
much you love that show,

75
00:03:50,991 --> 00:03:53,300
because just last weekend,

76
00:03:53,330 --> 00:03:56,229
I decided to have the glee
club perform Rocky Horror

77
00:03:56,230 --> 00:03:57,665
for the school musical this year.

78
00:03:58,380 --> 00:03:59,829
Wow, Will. Yeah.

79
00:03:59,830 --> 00:04:02,169
Cool, right? It's very, very cool.

80
00:04:02,170 --> 00:04:03,469
That's so... I mean,

81
00:04:03,470 --> 00:04:05,960
who knew that Rocky Horror was
so important to both of us?

82
00:04:05,961 --> 00:04:08,030
Yeah. Yeah, I guess so.

83
00:04:10,020 --> 00:04:12,039
Isn't there some
pretty risqué material

84
00:04:12,040 --> 00:04:13,040
in there, though?

85
00:04:14,568 --> 00:04:16,090
Yeah, I mean,
I'll probably have to

86
00:04:16,091 --> 00:04:17,230
make some edits here and there,

87
00:04:17,231 --> 00:04:18,700
but it's worth it to
expose the kids to

88
00:04:18,701 --> 00:04:21,150
one of my favorite
musicals of all time.

89
00:04:21,690 --> 00:04:22,970
Yeah. I love that show.

90
00:04:22,971 --> 00:04:23,990
Wow, yeah. Mm.

91
00:04:25,006 --> 00:04:27,789
Well, I'm thinking you're gonna
have to edit the whole thing out

92
00:04:27,790 --> 00:04:29,919
if you're gonna get Sue and
Figgins to sign off on it.

93
00:04:29,920 --> 00:04:32,380
But, um, that's really exciting.

94
00:04:32,990 --> 00:04:33,760
Right.

95
00:04:33,890 --> 00:04:35,190
Let's go, Rocky Horror.

96
00:04:36,390 --> 00:04:37,970
Oh, um, yep. Yeah.

97
00:04:45,440 --> 00:04:47,570
So what are you gonna be
for Halloween this year?

98
00:04:47,720 --> 00:04:49,530
I'm going as a peanut allergy.

99
00:04:50,130 --> 00:04:51,620
Great news, guys.

100
00:04:52,050 --> 00:04:53,490
I've had a little inspiration.

101
00:04:53,610 --> 00:04:56,510
This week's musical lesson
isn't really a lesson.

102
00:04:57,030 --> 00:04:58,320
It's a musical.

103
00:04:58,321 --> 00:04:59,780
Oh, please be Evita,
please be Evita...

104
00:04:59,781 --> 00:05:00,870
Rocky Horror.

105
00:05:01,870 --> 00:05:02,990
I've never seen it.

106
00:05:03,840 --> 00:05:04,970
Mr. Shue. Yep?

107
00:05:05,090 --> 00:05:06,769
While I admire your choice

108
00:05:06,770 --> 00:05:08,380
of the groundbreaking
'70s musical,

109
00:05:08,381 --> 00:05:10,100
aren't you worried
that the adult themes

110
00:05:10,101 --> 00:05:11,389
might be a point of controversy?

111
00:05:11,390 --> 00:05:13,760
Seriously. A school in Texas
couldn't even do rent.

112
00:05:13,761 --> 00:05:15,959
It caused an outrage and
they had to cancel the show.

113
00:05:15,960 --> 00:05:17,569
Isn't that the whole
point of the arts?

114
00:05:17,570 --> 00:05:19,199
Pushing boundaries, doing things

115
00:05:19,200 --> 00:05:20,570
people say you can't
do for the sake of

116
00:05:20,571 --> 00:05:21,550
self-expression?

117
00:05:22,050 --> 00:05:23,430
I got it all figured out.

118
00:05:23,431 --> 00:05:25,349
I cut out some of the
more risqué sections.

119
00:05:25,350 --> 00:05:28,059
And I'm sending home
permission slips

120
00:05:28,060 --> 00:05:30,259
to all your parents to make
sure that they're okay with it.

121
00:05:30,260 --> 00:05:34,109
And we're going to charge
admission and use the proceeds

122
00:05:34,110 --> 00:05:35,010
to help pay for transportation

123
00:05:35,011 --> 00:05:37,040
to nationals in New York.

124
00:05:39,040 --> 00:05:40,790
Okay, let's talk about casting.

125
00:05:40,890 --> 00:05:42,629
Oh, finn and I will
play Brad and Janet.

126
00:05:42,660 --> 00:05:44,469
Ah! And I'll be playing

127
00:05:44,470 --> 00:05:45,810
the guy in the wheelchair, right?

128
00:05:45,811 --> 00:05:46,799
That's what I was thinking.

129
00:05:46,800 --> 00:05:48,509
And I thought Kurt could play

130
00:05:48,510 --> 00:05:49,579
the role of Frank-n-furter.

131
00:05:49,580 --> 00:05:51,119
No. There's no way

132
00:05:51,120 --> 00:05:53,970
I'm playing a transvestite
in high heels and fishnets

133
00:05:54,210 --> 00:05:55,240
and wearing lipstick.

134
00:05:55,241 --> 00:05:57,200
Why? 'Cause that
look was last season?

135
00:05:57,640 --> 00:05:58,460
I'll do it.

136
00:05:59,100 --> 00:05:59,970
Really?

137
00:06:00,020 --> 00:06:01,380
It's, like, the male lead.

138
00:06:01,450 --> 00:06:03,949
I know, but I'm feeling
a little more confident

139
00:06:03,950 --> 00:06:05,909
about my singing voice
after our duets project.

140
00:06:05,910 --> 00:06:07,900
Great! I have no
problem with that.

141
00:06:07,901 --> 00:06:09,860
Now, we're a little
short on female roles,

142
00:06:09,910 --> 00:06:12,606
so we're going to have to double
up on columbias and magentas.

143
00:06:12,630 --> 00:06:14,180
It's standard
practice on Broadway.

144
00:06:14,200 --> 00:06:15,820
It'll preserve your voices.

145
00:06:16,110 --> 00:06:17,330
I'd like to preserve you.

146
00:06:17,390 --> 00:06:18,410
In a jar.

147
00:06:18,550 --> 00:06:19,670
In my basement.

148
00:06:19,710 --> 00:06:20,540
Sam.

149
00:06:21,050 --> 00:06:23,050
I'd like you to play the
role of the creature.

150
00:06:23,060 --> 00:06:24,400
From the black lagoon?

151
00:06:24,450 --> 00:06:26,999
Rocky. He's like the
frankenstein character,

152
00:06:27,000 --> 00:06:28,920
but blond. You'll kill the part.

153
00:06:28,970 --> 00:06:30,530
He's cute, just like you.

154
00:06:30,590 --> 00:06:32,189
Better start working on those abs.

155
00:06:32,190 --> 00:06:34,712
Are you kidding me? You could
cut glass with these babies.

156
00:06:34,860 --> 00:06:36,512
I have no problem
showing off my body.

157
00:06:37,190 --> 00:06:40,140
Okay. Looks like we
got ourselves a show.

158
00:06:41,950 --> 00:06:44,949
So then after the time warp,
riff raff aka Kurt

159
00:06:44,950 --> 00:06:46,730
takes us to Frank-n-furter's lab.

160
00:06:48,070 --> 00:06:50,289
I have no idea what's
going on in this script,

161
00:06:50,290 --> 00:06:52,180
and it's not in a cool
inception kind of way.

162
00:06:52,181 --> 00:06:52,910
Just try, okay?

163
00:06:52,980 --> 00:06:55,250
All right, so, then they
take off our wet clothes,

164
00:06:55,251 --> 00:06:57,381
and we do the rest of the
scene in our underwear.

165
00:06:58,370 --> 00:07:00,029
Wait, I'm in my tighty-whities?

166
00:07:00,030 --> 00:07:00,540
Yeah.

167
00:07:01,990 --> 00:07:04,179
I can't be on stage,

168
00:07:04,180 --> 00:07:05,110
in front of the whole school

169
00:07:05,111 --> 00:07:06,459
in my tighty-whities. They're...

170
00:07:06,460 --> 00:07:08,260
Gonna be able to see my whole...

171
00:07:09,300 --> 00:07:10,050
Business.

172
00:07:10,051 --> 00:07:12,169
Come on. It will just be
like going to the pool.

173
00:07:12,170 --> 00:07:13,670
I wear a swim shirt at the pool.

174
00:07:13,810 --> 00:07:16,027
I tell everybody it's because
I burn easily, but...

175
00:07:17,470 --> 00:07:18,920
Look... I know I'm a big athlete,

176
00:07:18,921 --> 00:07:20,450
and it's not manly or anything...

177
00:07:22,930 --> 00:07:24,830
But I'm kind of insecure
about how I look.

178
00:07:28,130 --> 00:07:29,190
Come on. You just...

179
00:07:30,190 --> 00:07:31,973
You know, you have a
different body type.

180
00:07:32,000 --> 00:07:33,740
I don't look like
Brittany or santana,

181
00:07:33,741 --> 00:07:35,263
but you still think
I'm hot, right?

182
00:07:36,180 --> 00:07:37,420
Yeah, of course.

183
00:07:37,500 --> 00:07:38,320
So, then...

184
00:07:38,620 --> 00:07:40,580
You're just going
to have to trust me

185
00:07:40,581 --> 00:07:43,260
that you're the
hottest guy in school.

186
00:07:44,930 --> 00:07:45,620
Okay?

187
00:07:45,800 --> 00:07:46,580
Okay. Come her

188
00:07:48,100 --> 00:07:48,930
all right.

189
00:07:49,080 --> 00:07:50,740
So, then after that,

190
00:07:50,758 --> 00:07:52,280
Frank-n-furter's
going to come down

191
00:07:52,281 --> 00:07:54,550
and elevator,
and when he comes down,

192
00:07:54,600 --> 00:07:55,700
we are scared.

193
00:07:55,740 --> 00:07:57,330
I might faint.
Maybe a couple times.

194
00:07:59,680 --> 00:08:01,319
...Making it the zoo's first

195
00:08:01,320 --> 00:08:04,859
unitarian chimp wedding
in over six years.

196
00:08:04,860 --> 00:08:07,550
And we certainly
wish the couple well.

197
00:08:08,330 --> 00:08:11,670
And now, let's mosey on
over to Sue's corner.

198
00:08:12,030 --> 00:08:13,340
Take it away, Sue.

199
00:08:13,350 --> 00:08:14,410
Thanks, .

200
00:08:14,540 --> 00:08:16,910
You know, Halloween
is fast approaching,

201
00:08:16,950 --> 00:08:18,890
the day when parents
encourage little boys

202
00:08:18,891 --> 00:08:20,450
to dress like little girls,

203
00:08:20,490 --> 00:08:22,540
and little girls to
dress like whores,

204
00:08:22,590 --> 00:08:25,499
and go door-to-door,
browbeating hardworking Americans

205
00:08:25,500 --> 00:08:26,890
into giving them free food.

206
00:08:26,940 --> 00:08:28,630
Well you know what, Western Ohio?

207
00:08:28,670 --> 00:08:31,490
We've lost the true
meaning of Halloween.

208
00:08:31,710 --> 00:08:32,520
Fear.

209
00:08:33,090 --> 00:08:35,189
Halloween is that
magical day of the year

210
00:08:35,190 --> 00:08:37,590
when a child is told their
grandmother's a demon

211
00:08:37,650 --> 00:08:39,450
who's been feeding
them rat casserole

212
00:08:39,451 --> 00:08:41,890
with a crunchy garnish
of their own scabs.

213
00:08:41,920 --> 00:08:43,470
Children must know fear.

214
00:08:43,510 --> 00:08:45,539
Without it, they won't
know how to behave.

215
00:08:45,540 --> 00:08:46,820
They'll try frenching
grizzly bears

216
00:08:46,821 --> 00:08:48,290
or consider living in Florida.

217
00:08:48,530 --> 00:08:51,240
So, moms, skip
trick-or-treating this year,

218
00:08:51,270 --> 00:08:53,620
and instead, sit your little
toddler down and explain

219
00:08:53,621 --> 00:08:55,050
that daddy's a hungry zombie,

220
00:08:55,200 --> 00:08:57,400
and before he went out
to sharpen his pitchfork,

221
00:08:57,480 --> 00:09:01,120
he whispered to mommy
that you looked delicious.

222
00:09:01,930 --> 00:09:04,590
And that's how Sue sees it.

223
00:09:05,120 --> 00:09:07,700
Sue, you're the cat's pajamas.

224
00:09:08,560 --> 00:09:10,040
And we'll be right back.

225
00:09:21,260 --> 00:09:22,939
Hello, Sue. I'm Barry Jeffries.

226
00:09:22,940 --> 00:09:23,880
This is Tim Stanwick.

227
00:09:23,881 --> 00:09:26,519
We're the new local station
managers down at Wohn.

228
00:09:26,520 --> 00:09:27,400
Do you mind if we sit?

229
00:09:27,401 --> 00:09:29,510
We loved Sue's corner last night.

230
00:09:29,834 --> 00:09:30,660
Oh, yeah. You know,

231
00:09:30,661 --> 00:09:32,560
we come from the
world of cable news.

232
00:09:32,600 --> 00:09:34,769
And we have... ideas.

233
00:09:34,770 --> 00:09:37,190
You see, good news
is about information.

234
00:09:37,230 --> 00:09:39,890
But great news is about fear.

235
00:09:39,990 --> 00:09:41,540
For example... Tim! Hmm?

236
00:09:41,760 --> 00:09:44,969
Did you hear about the swarm
of africanized killer bees?

237
00:09:44,970 --> 00:09:46,449
No. Wouldn't it be awful

238
00:09:46,450 --> 00:09:48,659
to see an entire town overrun

239
00:09:48,660 --> 00:09:49,550
by killer bees?

240
00:09:49,551 --> 00:09:51,010
I'm sorry, did you just say, Tim,

241
00:09:51,011 --> 00:09:54,089
"an entire town overrun
by killer bees"?

242
00:09:54,090 --> 00:09:56,369
Well, I ju... there's your quote.

243
00:09:56,370 --> 00:09:57,690
And you can replace "killer bees"

244
00:09:57,691 --> 00:10:00,010
with whatever you want!
Terrorists!

245
00:10:00,050 --> 00:10:00,990
Mexicans!

246
00:10:00,991 --> 00:10:02,809
Mexican terrorists!

247
00:10:02,810 --> 00:10:03,590
Ants!

248
00:10:03,720 --> 00:10:06,190
Mexican terrorist ants!

249
00:10:16,250 --> 00:10:18,100
So, what can I do for you?

250
00:10:18,190 --> 00:10:21,040
Someone at this school is
seeking the stage rights

251
00:10:21,490 --> 00:10:25,320
to Rocky Horror as
this year's musical.

252
00:10:26,540 --> 00:10:28,170
I take it you know the show.

253
00:10:30,500 --> 00:10:32,860
When I was younger,
I took my sister to the show.

254
00:10:33,960 --> 00:10:35,759
The audience was so enraged

255
00:10:35,760 --> 00:10:38,100
at having a disabled
person in their midst,

256
00:10:38,320 --> 00:10:39,430
you know what they did?

257
00:10:39,540 --> 00:10:41,610
They threw toast at us.

258
00:10:45,133 --> 00:10:46,350
You want me to shut it down?

259
00:10:46,351 --> 00:10:48,530
No. No.

260
00:10:49,390 --> 00:10:52,779
We want you to do an expos?
Proving that the secular

261
00:10:52,780 --> 00:10:55,770
progressive agenda has
finally arrived here

262
00:10:55,810 --> 00:10:57,999
in the Lima, Ohio,
school district.

263
00:10:58,000 --> 00:11:01,560
Sue, it's got a local
Emmy written all over it.

264
00:11:03,050 --> 00:11:03,940
We have a deal?

265
00:11:11,010 --> 00:11:13,399
All right, places,
Finn and Rachel.

266
00:11:13,400 --> 00:11:14,659
I want to start with
"damn it, Janet."

267
00:11:14,660 --> 00:11:16,079
Oh! I cannot wait till

268
00:11:16,080 --> 00:11:18,970
Finn takes his top off so we can
all see the hotness underneath.

269
00:11:18,971 --> 00:11:21,160
What are you talking about?
You can't have sloppy Joes

270
00:11:21,161 --> 00:11:23,552
every day for lunch and think
you can get away with it.

271
00:11:23,580 --> 00:11:25,480
Um... that's incredibly rude.

272
00:11:25,540 --> 00:11:27,400
Is it? Guys whisper
behind our backs

273
00:11:27,401 --> 00:11:29,330
about how we girls look every day.

274
00:11:29,340 --> 00:11:30,690
They objectify us all the time.

275
00:11:30,691 --> 00:11:32,909
He sort of has a point.
Yeah, earlier today,

276
00:11:32,910 --> 00:11:35,049
Artie asked if he could
make a gigantic omelet

277
00:11:35,050 --> 00:11:38,360
when I'm done with the ostrich
eggs I'm smuggling in my bra.

278
00:11:39,770 --> 00:11:42,990
I'm super looking forward to
seeing Sam in his gold bikini.

279
00:11:43,030 --> 00:11:44,570
It's gonna be ab-ulous.

280
00:11:44,571 --> 00:11:46,010
Can we get on with rehearsal,
please? Yeah!

281
00:11:46,011 --> 00:11:47,289
I agree! Yes.

282
00:11:47,290 --> 00:11:48,849
Let's stay focused, guys.
All right...

283
00:11:48,850 --> 00:11:51,929
Riff raff and Columbia
and magenta, team one.

284
00:11:51,930 --> 00:11:52,980
Take your places.

285
00:11:53,030 --> 00:11:54,850
Let's rock and roll.

286
00:11:56,440 --> 00:11:57,280
Hey, Janet...

287
00:11:57,340 --> 00:11:58,220
Yes, Brad?

288
00:11:59,230 --> 00:12:00,580
I've got something to say.

289
00:12:03,620 --> 00:12:04,840
I really loved the...

290
00:12:06,170 --> 00:12:07,240
Skillful way...

291
00:12:09,060 --> 00:12:10,750
You beat the other girls...

292
00:12:11,930 --> 00:12:13,330
To the bride's bouquet

293
00:12:14,150 --> 00:12:15,250
oh, Brad!

294
00:12:18,500 --> 00:12:21,460
* The river was deep,
but I swam it Janet... *

295
00:12:21,500 --> 00:12:24,630
* The future is ours,
so let's plan it Janet *

296
00:12:24,660 --> 00:12:27,720
* So please don't tell
me to can it Janet *

297
00:12:27,740 --> 00:12:29,020
* I've one thing to say *

298
00:12:29,021 --> 00:12:32,010
* And that's damn it,
Janet, I love you *

299
00:12:34,490 --> 00:12:37,539
* The road was long,
but I ran it Janet... *

300
00:12:37,540 --> 00:12:40,569
* There's a fire in my heart
and you fan it Janet *

301
00:12:40,570 --> 00:12:43,710
* If there's one fool for you,
then I am it Janet... *

302
00:12:43,760 --> 00:12:45,169
* I've one thing to say *

303
00:12:45,170 --> 00:12:48,260
* And that's damn it,
Janet, I love you *

304
00:12:50,730 --> 00:12:55,090
* Here's a ring to prove
that I'm no joker *

305
00:12:56,810 --> 00:13:02,230
* There's three ways
that love can grow *

306
00:13:02,800 --> 00:13:08,150
* That's good, bad or mediocre *

307
00:13:08,510 --> 00:13:12,680
* Oh, j-a-n-e-t, I love you so *

308
00:13:14,830 --> 00:13:18,190
* It's nicer than Betty Munroe had *
* Oh, Brad *

309
00:13:18,230 --> 00:13:21,300
* Now we're engaged and
I'm so glad Oh, Brad *

310
00:13:21,340 --> 00:13:24,309
* That you've met mom and
you know dad Oh, Brad *

311
00:13:24,310 --> 00:13:25,520
* I've one thing to say *

312
00:13:25,521 --> 00:13:29,410
* And that's Brad,
I'm mad for you, too... *

313
00:13:33,164 --> 00:13:33,990
What made you think

314
00:13:33,991 --> 00:13:36,643
you could get away with doing
this show without my knowledge?

315
00:13:37,910 --> 00:13:40,849
I didn't; I was hoping
just to run out the clock

316
00:13:40,850 --> 00:13:42,090
until it was too late to stop us.

317
00:13:42,091 --> 00:13:43,510
Who says I want to stop you?

318
00:13:44,020 --> 00:13:46,900
I appreciate how Rocky
Horror pushes boundaries.

319
00:13:48,139 --> 00:13:49,489
So you're not gonna fight us?

320
00:13:49,490 --> 00:13:50,940
Perhaps not.

321
00:13:51,090 --> 00:13:52,830
I just want to be involved, Will.

322
00:13:52,920 --> 00:13:54,330
The arts matter.

323
00:13:56,920 --> 00:13:58,830
Fine. Join us.

324
00:13:59,020 --> 00:14:00,920
Play the part of
the criminologist.

325
00:14:00,921 --> 00:14:02,130
We need someone with authority.

326
00:14:02,131 --> 00:14:02,980
Done. Great.

327
00:14:03,980 --> 00:14:05,090
We rehearse tonight.

328
00:14:05,091 --> 00:14:07,550
Fantastic. Give me
time to do my rewrites.

329
00:14:08,000 --> 00:14:10,789
I'm sorry? Yeah,
it says right here in my contract

330
00:14:10,790 --> 00:14:11,970
that I get final script approval.

331
00:14:11,971 --> 00:14:13,830
And I wouldn't fight it, Will.

332
00:14:14,110 --> 00:14:17,270
I'm a notary public.
See you on the boards, buddy.

333
00:14:24,060 --> 00:14:25,050
75...

334
00:14:25,390 --> 00:14:28,690
Chicken, egg whites,
fish... no salmon...

335
00:14:28,790 --> 00:14:31,460
oatmeal, brown rice,
but not after 6:00 P.M.

336
00:14:31,570 --> 00:14:34,430
No butter or oil and no soda.

337
00:14:35,650 --> 00:14:36,610
That's all you eat?

338
00:14:38,120 --> 00:14:39,880
Ain't no carpool lane to sexy.

339
00:14:39,920 --> 00:14:41,120
Damn straight.

340
00:14:41,330 --> 00:14:44,049
I don't know, man, I never
used to think about this stuff.

341
00:14:44,050 --> 00:14:45,439
I mean, we're guys.

342
00:14:45,440 --> 00:14:46,699
When did this start to matter?

343
00:14:46,700 --> 00:14:48,390
I personally blame the Internet.

344
00:14:48,391 --> 00:14:51,020
Once Internet porn was invented,
girls could watch without having

345
00:14:51,021 --> 00:14:53,200
to make that embarrassing
trip to the video store.

346
00:14:53,310 --> 00:14:55,229
Internet porn altered

347
00:14:55,230 --> 00:14:56,180
the female brain chemistry,

348
00:14:56,181 --> 00:14:57,311
making them more like men.

349
00:14:57,430 --> 00:14:59,720
And thus more concerned
with our bodies.

350
00:14:59,721 --> 00:15:02,279
But doesn't it get exhausting
thinking about what you eat,

351
00:15:02,280 --> 00:15:04,350
like, working out
like a madman? Nah.

352
00:15:05,080 --> 00:15:08,459
I mean, if I miss a workout or
eat a hot dog, I hate myself

353
00:15:08,460 --> 00:15:09,980
for a few days, but the fact is,

354
00:15:10,500 --> 00:15:14,269
if I want to be cool,
if I want to get Quinn for good,

355
00:15:14,270 --> 00:15:15,270
I got to look the part.

356
00:15:16,228 --> 00:15:17,880
You get up on that
stage and look like

357
00:15:17,881 --> 00:15:20,229
the Pillsbury doughboy,
no way you're staying popular.

358
00:15:21,060 --> 00:15:22,364
Come on, let's do some squats.

359
00:15:29,460 --> 00:15:32,025
I think maybe that's why Sue's
been such a bully all along.

360
00:15:32,210 --> 00:15:33,890
She really just wants
to be included.

361
00:15:38,840 --> 00:15:39,680
Listen...

362
00:15:40,230 --> 00:15:41,999
I really don't want to

363
00:15:42,000 --> 00:15:44,710
overstep my boundaries here,
but I really need your help.

364
00:15:45,220 --> 00:15:47,120
I-I need to find
all these costumes,

365
00:15:47,121 --> 00:15:49,010
and nobody knows Rocky
Horror like you.

366
00:15:51,010 --> 00:15:52,010
I don't know, would you

367
00:15:52,050 --> 00:15:54,070
mind coming on board
as my costume designer?

368
00:15:55,030 --> 00:15:57,840
Are you serious?
You're not kidding?

369
00:15:58,330 --> 00:16:00,360
I would love to! I'd love to!

370
00:16:00,450 --> 00:16:02,449
Well, it's gonna be a lot of work,

371
00:16:02,450 --> 00:16:04,150
and we're gonna be spending
a lot of time together.

372
00:16:04,151 --> 00:16:05,470
Yes, it's a dream come true!

373
00:16:05,840 --> 00:16:08,120
I mean, the costume designing
is a dream come true;

374
00:16:08,121 --> 00:16:10,200
Not the spending a lot of time...
not that spending a lot of time

375
00:16:10,201 --> 00:16:12,810
wouldn't be, but it... because
of Carl... I've got the Carl.

376
00:16:13,160 --> 00:16:14,690
Yeah, Carl. Yeah.

377
00:16:15,910 --> 00:16:18,019
Mr. Shue? My parents
read the script,

378
00:16:18,020 --> 00:16:19,890
and they're pulling me
out of Rocky Horror.

379
00:16:20,000 --> 00:16:20,790
What?

380
00:16:21,180 --> 00:16:23,759
I really want to do it,
but they're just not cool

381
00:16:23,760 --> 00:16:25,238
with me dressing up like a tranny.

382
00:16:25,970 --> 00:16:28,240
I hate to let you down,
but I'm out.

383
00:16:34,800 --> 00:16:35,590
Becky...

384
00:16:35,810 --> 00:16:37,590
That is the best Halloween costume

385
00:16:37,730 --> 00:16:38,900
I've ever seen.

386
00:16:38,901 --> 00:16:39,900
Thanks, coach.

387
00:16:40,320 --> 00:16:41,870
There's only one thing missing.

388
00:16:42,360 --> 00:16:44,140
Go scream at some fatties.

389
00:16:44,655 --> 00:16:47,090
Oh, and Becky, next year,
when you trick or treat as me,

390
00:16:47,091 --> 00:16:50,280
you'll need to be clutching a bright,
glittering local Emmy.

391
00:16:55,840 --> 00:16:57,580
Uh, Sue, I've got some bad news.

392
00:16:58,120 --> 00:17:00,850
We lost our Frank-n-furter,
and I can't find a replacement.

393
00:17:01,980 --> 00:17:02,950
Musical's canceled.

394
00:17:08,850 --> 00:17:11,470
Yeah, that's cute, that's good.
Look at this. See?

395
00:17:11,471 --> 00:17:12,889
I'm gonna have to
squeeze into this.

396
00:17:12,890 --> 00:17:14,570
They were out of the
latex panties, so I got

397
00:17:14,571 --> 00:17:15,930
the see-through, see? Look.

398
00:17:16,170 --> 00:17:20,660
Take your sick, perverted sex
games out of this school!

399
00:17:20,661 --> 00:17:21,959
No, no, no, Sue,
this is not what it looks like...

400
00:17:21,960 --> 00:17:23,010
I should have known.

401
00:17:23,060 --> 00:17:25,819
People who dress like librarians...
all sex addicts.

402
00:17:25,820 --> 00:17:26,820
I'm sorry. And you are?

403
00:17:27,680 --> 00:17:28,430
Oh, okay.

404
00:17:28,520 --> 00:17:30,609
Carl, meet Sue. Sue, this is

405
00:17:30,610 --> 00:17:31,580
my boyfriend Carl.

406
00:17:31,650 --> 00:17:34,130
Sue, how do you do?

407
00:17:35,610 --> 00:17:36,540
Okay.

408
00:17:36,630 --> 00:17:38,649
I was just showing Emma
my Halloween costume.

409
00:17:38,650 --> 00:17:40,600
We're both sort of
Rocky Horror fans.

410
00:17:40,601 --> 00:17:41,500
Sort of? Well...

411
00:17:41,501 --> 00:17:43,200
Yeah! Sort of? Please!

412
00:17:43,240 --> 00:17:46,259
Carl knows the lyrics to every
single song. Every song.

413
00:17:46,260 --> 00:17:47,720
He has an amazing voice,
too, so...

414
00:17:47,721 --> 00:17:49,480
Well, for a dentist.
For a dentist...

415
00:17:53,060 --> 00:17:53,890
You okay?

416
00:17:55,270 --> 00:17:56,579
Yeah, Carl, it's just...

417
00:17:56,580 --> 00:17:59,100
My heart is, uh...
is breaking just a little bit.

418
00:17:59,101 --> 00:18:00,760
I'm not sure if you
know this about me,

419
00:18:00,761 --> 00:18:03,720
but I am a huge proponent
of the arts in schools,

420
00:18:03,750 --> 00:18:06,010
and, well,
even at this very school,

421
00:18:06,050 --> 00:18:08,479
gosh, we're failing,
and, uh, you know,

422
00:18:08,480 --> 00:18:10,915
when the kids don't have arts,
they turn to drugs and...

423
00:18:10,990 --> 00:18:13,370
With drugs comes tooth loss and...

424
00:18:14,020 --> 00:18:16,220
Are you ready for a
chilling statistic?

425
00:18:17,150 --> 00:18:20,590
70% of all teeth in
this school are wooden.

426
00:18:20,890 --> 00:18:22,310
Seventy percent?

427
00:18:23,080 --> 00:18:24,602
Is there anything
I can do to help?

428
00:18:27,670 --> 00:18:28,780
I don't understand.

429
00:18:29,048 --> 00:18:30,570
Well, you guys have
a hole to fill,

430
00:18:30,571 --> 00:18:32,136
and I'm just trying
to help fill it.

431
00:18:32,420 --> 00:18:33,910
Wanky. Santana!

432
00:18:35,410 --> 00:18:38,710
Well, you know,
I can't just give you a role.

433
00:18:39,050 --> 00:18:40,060
You'd have to try out.

434
00:18:40,760 --> 00:18:42,970
Fair enough, but I'll
need a lady to sing to.

435
00:18:43,140 --> 00:18:43,930
Ems?

436
00:18:44,320 --> 00:18:45,040
Okay.

437
00:18:46,060 --> 00:18:47,420
"Hot patootie." B-flat.

438
00:18:54,050 --> 00:18:56,610
* Whatever happened
to Saturday night *

439
00:18:57,150 --> 00:18:59,520
* When you dressed up sharp
and you felt all right? *

440
00:18:59,670 --> 00:19:02,370
* It don't seem the same
since cosmic light *

441
00:19:02,570 --> 00:19:05,580
* Came into my life,
I thought I was divine *

442
00:19:05,780 --> 00:19:08,340
* I used to go for a ride
with a chick who'd go *

443
00:19:08,410 --> 00:19:11,230
* And listen to the
music on the radio *

444
00:19:11,310 --> 00:19:14,160
* A saxophone was blowin'
on a rock and roll show *

445
00:19:14,220 --> 00:19:17,240
* You'd climb in the back seat,
really had a good time *

446
00:19:18,710 --> 00:19:21,260
* Hot patootie, bless my soul *

447
00:19:21,870 --> 00:19:24,370
* I really love
that rock and roll *

448
00:19:24,640 --> 00:19:27,230
* Hot patootie, bless my soul *

449
00:19:27,650 --> 00:19:30,090
* I really love
that rock and roll *

450
00:19:38,920 --> 00:19:39,640
Come on.

451
00:19:39,641 --> 00:19:41,858
* My head used to swim from
the perfume I smelled *

452
00:19:41,880 --> 00:19:44,750
* My hands kind of fumbled
with her white plastic belt *

453
00:19:44,830 --> 00:19:46,560
* I'd taste her
baby pink lipstick *

454
00:19:46,561 --> 00:19:47,749
* And that's when I'd melt *

455
00:19:47,750 --> 00:19:50,330
* She whispered in my ear
tonight she really was mine *

456
00:19:50,950 --> 00:19:53,590
* Get back in front,
put some hair oil on *

457
00:19:53,720 --> 00:19:56,390
* Buddy holly was singing
his very last song *

458
00:19:56,520 --> 00:19:59,230
* With your arms around your girl,
you'd try to sing along *

459
00:19:59,310 --> 00:20:02,300
* You felt pretty good, whoo,
you really had a good time *

460
00:20:03,880 --> 00:20:06,540
* Hot patootie, bless my soul *

461
00:20:06,920 --> 00:20:09,350
* I really love
that rock and roll *

462
00:20:09,810 --> 00:20:12,360
* Hot patootie, bless my soul *

463
00:20:12,720 --> 00:20:15,320
* I really love
that rock and roll *

464
00:20:21,260 --> 00:20:23,890
* Hot patootie, bless my soul *

465
00:20:24,440 --> 00:20:26,930
* I really love
that rock and roll *

466
00:20:27,310 --> 00:20:29,820
* Hot patootie, bless my soul *

467
00:20:30,200 --> 00:20:32,830
* I really love
that rock and roll *

468
00:20:33,330 --> 00:20:35,750
* Hot patootie, bless my soul *

469
00:20:36,010 --> 00:20:38,530
* I really love
that rock and roll *

470
00:20:38,830 --> 00:20:41,480
* Hot patootie, bless my soul *

471
00:20:41,630 --> 00:20:44,370
* I really love that
rock and roll! *

472
00:20:49,050 --> 00:20:50,030
Yeah!

473
00:20:54,660 --> 00:20:56,430
No, no, no, no, wait, wait, wait.

474
00:20:56,505 --> 00:20:57,693
This will not do.

475
00:20:57,739 --> 00:20:58,913
Excuse me? For this musical

476
00:20:58,914 --> 00:21:01,659
to continue, we need a
Frank-n-furter, not an Eddie.

477
00:21:01,660 --> 00:21:03,711
Eddie was eliminated
in my rewrites.

478
00:21:04,381 --> 00:21:05,186
Sue's right.

479
00:21:05,668 --> 00:21:08,492
You want to play in our sandbox,
sing a Frank-n-furter number.

480
00:21:08,723 --> 00:21:11,095
Well, I'm sorry, bro,
but I think it's fine to wear

481
00:21:11,096 --> 00:21:13,442
that Frankie bustier in the
privacy of your own home...

482
00:21:13,443 --> 00:21:15,411
I'm freaky like that...
but don't you think it's a little

483
00:21:15,412 --> 00:21:17,912
inappropriate in a high school musical?
I mean, at least if I

484
00:21:17,913 --> 00:21:20,105
play Eddie, I won't have to
grind up against the students.

485
00:21:20,106 --> 00:21:22,117
You know, Eddie's
an important role.

486
00:21:22,118 --> 00:21:24,379
If I did it, I'd be showing
my support for the arts.

487
00:21:25,787 --> 00:21:27,570
Are you telling me how
to direct my show?

488
00:21:27,571 --> 00:21:28,646
Will, Will...

489
00:21:28,647 --> 00:21:29,468
Mr. Shue...

490
00:21:31,586 --> 00:21:34,130
I'd like to play Frank-n-furter.

491
00:21:34,945 --> 00:21:37,891
I was rereading the script
yesterday, and it said

492
00:21:37,892 --> 00:21:39,490
"don't dream it, be it."

493
00:21:39,924 --> 00:21:41,576
And it's my dream
to play a lead role,

494
00:21:41,577 --> 00:21:43,773
so I figure, why not me?

495
00:21:43,774 --> 00:21:46,275
I mean, I'd be all kind of
crazy sexy in that outfit.

496
00:21:46,276 --> 00:21:47,606
And I can reinterpret the

497
00:21:47,607 --> 00:21:49,895
number a little bit...
make it more modern.

498
00:21:51,657 --> 00:21:53,556
I'd really like the chance,
Mr. Shue.

499
00:21:53,887 --> 00:21:55,887
Well, there you go, Will.
You killed two birds

500
00:21:55,888 --> 00:21:58,099
with one stone here today...
congratulations.

501
00:21:58,100 --> 00:22:00,073
Look, you got yourself
a Frank-n-furter

502
00:22:00,074 --> 00:22:00,872
and an Eddie.

503
00:22:01,363 --> 00:22:02,566
This is outstanding.

504
00:22:11,039 --> 00:22:13,580
You ready for our first
dress rehearsal? Mm-hmm.

505
00:22:14,168 --> 00:22:16,300
Okay, guys... places!

506
00:22:20,568 --> 00:22:21,939
Uh, Mr. Shue?

507
00:22:22,710 --> 00:22:24,177
Uh... I know I'm supposed to be

508
00:22:24,245 --> 00:22:27,764
in my underwear for this scene,
and I'm totally down with that.

509
00:22:27,982 --> 00:22:31,001
I thought maybe I would save it
for the opening, if that's okay.

510
00:22:32,620 --> 00:22:34,687
Um, also, miss Pillsbury, is there

511
00:22:34,755 --> 00:22:36,188
a way I could...

512
00:22:36,189 --> 00:22:38,772
Wear, like, some gold
board shorts or something?

513
00:22:38,773 --> 00:22:39,651
These are really short.

514
00:22:39,652 --> 00:22:42,262
I'm afraid I'm gonna
show off some nuttage.

515
00:22:42,329 --> 00:22:43,596
Well... we'll take a note.

516
00:22:43,664 --> 00:22:44,964
We can't stop, guys.

517
00:22:45,372 --> 00:22:46,399
It's a dress rehearsal.

518
00:22:46,467 --> 00:22:47,834
Come on, keep going.

519
00:22:48,312 --> 00:22:49,380
And...

520
00:22:49,381 --> 00:22:50,065
Action!

521
00:22:50,066 --> 00:22:52,171
Oh, Brad, let's get out of here.

522
00:22:52,172 --> 00:22:55,794
I'm cold, I'm wet and
I'm just plain scared.

523
00:22:55,795 --> 00:22:56,569
Well, I'm here.

524
00:22:56,570 --> 00:22:57,918
There's nothing to worry about.

525
00:23:01,777 --> 00:23:03,801
* How do you do, I *

526
00:23:03,975 --> 00:23:06,079
* See you met my *

527
00:23:06,080 --> 00:23:08,515
* Faithful handyman *

528
00:23:09,376 --> 00:23:12,394
* He's just a little broke down *

529
00:23:12,771 --> 00:23:14,522
* 'Cause wouldn't you know *

530
00:23:14,920 --> 00:23:17,482
* He thought you
were the candy man *

531
00:23:19,396 --> 00:23:21,255
* Don't get strung out *

532
00:23:21,849 --> 00:23:23,842
* By the way I look *

533
00:23:23,843 --> 00:23:26,801
* Don't judge a
book by its cover *

534
00:23:28,319 --> 00:23:30,282
* I'm not much of a girl *

535
00:23:30,503 --> 00:23:31,789
* By the light of day *

536
00:23:31,790 --> 00:23:35,456
* But by night,
I'm one hell of a lover *

537
00:23:36,008 --> 00:23:39,648
* I'm just a sweet transvestite *

538
00:23:40,775 --> 00:23:43,956
* From sin... sational *

539
00:23:44,102 --> 00:23:46,839
* Transylvania *

540
00:23:49,338 --> 00:23:51,662
* Why don't you
stay for the night *

541
00:23:51,663 --> 00:23:52,341
Night.

542
00:23:52,848 --> 00:23:54,003
* Or maybe a bite *

543
00:23:54,004 --> 00:23:54,528
Bite.

544
00:23:54,983 --> 00:23:57,853
* I could show you my
favorite obsession *

545
00:23:58,525 --> 00:24:01,094
* I've been making a man *

546
00:24:01,095 --> 00:24:03,267
* With blond hair and a tan *

547
00:24:03,268 --> 00:24:06,818
* And he's good for
relieving my tension *

548
00:24:07,129 --> 00:24:10,218
* I'm just a sweet transvestite *

549
00:24:10,219 --> 00:24:11,952
* A sweet transvestite *

550
00:24:11,953 --> 00:24:15,064
* From sin... sational *

551
00:24:15,065 --> 00:24:18,271
* Transylvania *

552
00:24:18,272 --> 00:24:20,559
* Hey, hey *

553
00:24:20,560 --> 00:24:23,574
* I'm just a sweet transvestite *

554
00:24:23,575 --> 00:24:25,256
* A sweet transvestite *

555
00:24:25,257 --> 00:24:28,183
* From sin... sational *

556
00:24:28,418 --> 00:24:31,680
* Transylvania. *

557
00:24:35,278 --> 00:24:37,744
So, come up to the lab...

558
00:24:39,013 --> 00:24:40,980
...And see what's on the slab.

559
00:24:42,549 --> 00:24:44,884
I see you shiver with antici...

560
00:24:47,855 --> 00:24:48,755
...Pation! Pation!

561
00:24:49,823 --> 00:24:51,691
* But maybe the rain *

562
00:24:52,693 --> 00:24:54,694
* Isn't really to blame *

563
00:24:55,729 --> 00:24:57,997
* So I'll remove the cause *

564
00:25:01,268 --> 00:25:05,435
* But not the symptom! *

565
00:25:14,381 --> 00:25:15,657
Now that's an entrance.

566
00:25:15,658 --> 00:25:18,776
Mr. director,
I take that wall out right?

567
00:25:18,777 --> 00:25:20,620
You're two acts early, Carl.

568
00:25:20,621 --> 00:25:21,688
You're supposed to bust through

569
00:25:21,689 --> 00:25:22,689
the dinner party scene.

570
00:25:23,475 --> 00:25:24,408
Oh... well, actually,

571
00:25:24,409 --> 00:25:27,085
I was sort of feeling my
entrance in this scene.

572
00:25:27,451 --> 00:25:30,226
Such good, good,
interesting impulses.

573
00:25:30,227 --> 00:25:30,954
Emma: Oh!

574
00:25:31,254 --> 00:25:33,495
Bravo, Carl, bravo.

575
00:25:36,970 --> 00:25:38,231
Will?

576
00:25:38,232 --> 00:25:39,895
Hey, I got your note
you wanted to see me.

577
00:25:39,896 --> 00:25:41,316
We have a problem with the show.

578
00:25:41,375 --> 00:25:42,685
It's Carl.

579
00:25:43,184 --> 00:25:44,155
Really?

580
00:25:44,611 --> 00:25:46,471
I thought he was perfect.

581
00:25:46,677 --> 00:25:48,583
I agree, but, uh...

582
00:25:49,183 --> 00:25:50,650
What he said during his audition,

583
00:25:50,718 --> 00:25:52,719
it's-it's-it's-it's haunted me.

584
00:25:53,233 --> 00:25:54,244
He's right.

585
00:25:54,418 --> 00:25:57,007
Some of these parts are just
too adult for kids to play.

586
00:25:57,669 --> 00:26:00,291
Oh, yeah, well,
I have to agree, Will.

587
00:26:00,292 --> 00:26:01,568
You know? Especially Sam.

588
00:26:01,569 --> 00:26:02,312
Sam! Right.

589
00:26:02,313 --> 00:26:03,715
He seems so uncomfortable.

590
00:26:03,716 --> 00:26:04,764
I know. I... yeah.

591
00:26:04,832 --> 00:26:06,099
So I spoke with him.

592
00:26:06,100 --> 00:26:07,700
Is there something
wrong with my body?

593
00:26:07,701 --> 00:26:08,768
Your body's fine, Sam.

594
00:26:09,202 --> 00:26:11,089
But, frankly, I think the role's

595
00:26:11,090 --> 00:26:13,330
a little too risqué for a student.

596
00:26:14,842 --> 00:26:18,338
I did feel kind of... embarrassed.

597
00:26:19,646 --> 00:26:21,314
Who's gonna play Rocky?

598
00:26:23,047 --> 00:26:25,164
Uh, I guess I have to.

599
00:26:25,165 --> 00:26:26,192
I'm-I'm sorry?

600
00:26:26,855 --> 00:26:29,342
I figured if Carl can
play Eddie, then...

601
00:26:29,976 --> 00:26:31,788
I can play Rocky. Hmm.

602
00:26:31,789 --> 00:26:34,026
Thing is, I'm not as familiar

603
00:26:34,094 --> 00:26:35,395
with the libretto as you are,

604
00:26:35,462 --> 00:26:37,730
and I can really use
your help rehearsing.

605
00:26:38,578 --> 00:26:42,769
Uh... I'm... are-are you
sure that's a good idea?

606
00:26:42,770 --> 00:26:44,337
I mean, you'll be a great Rocky.

607
00:26:44,405 --> 00:26:47,473
You look really,
really great... h-healthy,

608
00:26:47,532 --> 00:26:49,282
but I mean, you're a teacher.

609
00:26:49,476 --> 00:26:51,208
Which is why I should do it.

610
00:26:51,209 --> 00:26:53,446
It will give the show a little
more credibility, you know?

611
00:26:53,447 --> 00:26:54,747
Oh.

612
00:26:54,799 --> 00:26:57,283
So... think you could help me out?

613
00:26:57,284 --> 00:26:58,851
I mean, I have to have
"touch-a touch me"

614
00:26:58,852 --> 00:27:00,853
down by rehearsal tomorrow.

615
00:27:03,893 --> 00:27:04,855
Yeah, okay.

616
00:27:04,856 --> 00:27:05,641
Okay?

617
00:27:06,904 --> 00:27:09,586
Um... well, I guess,

618
00:27:09,587 --> 00:27:11,687
if you want to start over there,

619
00:27:11,688 --> 00:27:13,487
and I will start here.

620
00:27:13,488 --> 00:27:14,479
Right. Good, good,
good, good. Good.

621
00:27:14,480 --> 00:27:16,299
So let's just, uh, just imagine

622
00:27:16,300 --> 00:27:19,502
that we're all alone in
Frank-n-furter's laboratory...

623
00:27:19,503 --> 00:27:20,451
Alone. Okay.

624
00:27:23,644 --> 00:27:26,479
* I was feeling done in *

625
00:27:27,929 --> 00:27:29,573
* Couldn't win *

626
00:27:31,183 --> 00:27:35,823
* I'd only ever kissed before... *

627
00:27:36,657 --> 00:27:38,420
You mean she...?
Uh-huh.

628
00:27:38,421 --> 00:27:41,694
* I felt there's no use getting *

629
00:27:42,221 --> 00:27:45,565
* Into heavy sweating *

630
00:27:45,632 --> 00:27:49,996
* It only leads to trouble and *

631
00:27:50,165 --> 00:27:52,407
* Bad fretting *

632
00:27:52,408 --> 00:27:54,945
* Now all I want to know *

633
00:27:55,822 --> 00:27:58,526
* Is how to go *

634
00:27:58,527 --> 00:28:02,066
* I've tasted blood
and I want more *

635
00:28:02,067 --> 00:28:04,453
* More, more, more *

636
00:28:04,619 --> 00:28:07,376
* I'll put up no resistance *

637
00:28:07,377 --> 00:28:10,448
* I want to stay the distance *

638
00:28:10,449 --> 00:28:13,514
* I've got an itch to scratch *

639
00:28:13,515 --> 00:28:16,112
* I need assistance *

640
00:28:16,113 --> 00:28:18,863
* Touch-a, touch-a,
touch-a touch me *

641
00:28:18,864 --> 00:28:21,505
* I want to be dirty *

642
00:28:21,506 --> 00:28:24,303
* Thrill me, chill me,
fulfill me *

643
00:28:24,304 --> 00:28:27,310
* Creature of the night *

644
00:28:31,747 --> 00:28:34,407
* Then if anything shows *

645
00:28:34,955 --> 00:28:37,625
* While you pose *

646
00:28:37,626 --> 00:28:40,999
* I'll oil you up
and drop you down *

647
00:28:41,000 --> 00:28:43,387
* Down, down, down *

648
00:28:43,571 --> 00:28:46,739
* And that's just
one small fraction *

649
00:28:46,906 --> 00:28:49,199
* Of the main attraction *

650
00:28:49,200 --> 00:28:52,156
Oh! *I want a friendly man *

651
00:28:52,637 --> 00:28:55,210
* And I need action *

652
00:28:55,211 --> 00:28:57,770
* Touch-a, touch-a,
touch-a touch me *

653
00:28:57,972 --> 00:29:00,754
* I want to be dirty *

654
00:29:00,755 --> 00:29:03,469
* Thrill me, chill me,
fulfill me *

655
00:29:03,470 --> 00:29:06,239
* Creature of the night *

656
00:29:06,240 --> 00:29:08,927
* Touch-a, touch-a,
touch-a touch me *

657
00:29:08,928 --> 00:29:11,816
* I want to be dirty *

658
00:29:11,817 --> 00:29:14,645
* Thrill me, chill me,
fulfill me *

659
00:29:14,646 --> 00:29:16,168
* Creature of the night *

660
00:29:16,169 --> 00:29:17,337
Uh-huh! Oh!

661
00:29:17,338 --> 00:29:19,764
* Touch-a, touch-a,
touch-a touch me *

662
00:29:19,765 --> 00:29:22,932
* Oh, I want to be dirty *

663
00:29:22,933 --> 00:29:25,516
* Thrill me, chill me,
fulfill me *

664
00:29:25,517 --> 00:29:28,385
* Creature of the night... *

665
00:29:28,386 --> 00:29:31,199
* Creature of the night *

666
00:29:31,200 --> 00:29:33,747
* Creature of the night *

667
00:29:33,978 --> 00:29:36,284
* Creature of the night *

668
00:29:36,794 --> 00:29:39,038
* Creature of the night*

669
00:29:39,712 --> 00:29:42,046
* Creature of the night *

670
00:29:42,406 --> 00:29:44,833
* Creature of the night *

671
00:29:44,834 --> 00:29:47,231
* Creature... of the night *

672
00:29:47,918 --> 00:29:50,390
* Creature of the night! *

673
00:29:53,660 --> 00:29:54,988
I...

674
00:29:55,262 --> 00:29:56,329
I, uh...

675
00:29:56,396 --> 00:29:57,430
I... I, uh...

676
00:30:09,074 --> 00:30:10,041
Whoa, whoa...

677
00:30:10,108 --> 00:30:11,042
Ah, wow, yeah.

678
00:30:11,109 --> 00:30:12,077
I would've had it.

679
00:30:12,078 --> 00:30:13,844
Yeah, sure. Not that big.

680
00:30:13,845 --> 00:30:14,831
Where you been? You're late.

681
00:30:14,832 --> 00:30:16,232
Sorry. I spaced.

682
00:30:17,237 --> 00:30:19,199
I'm not playing Rocky anymore.

683
00:30:19,440 --> 00:30:21,238
You're kidding. Who is?

684
00:30:21,698 --> 00:30:22,977
Mr. Shue.

685
00:30:23,908 --> 00:30:24,971
I totally blew this.

686
00:30:24,972 --> 00:30:27,388
I shouldn't have made all those
demands about my costume.

687
00:30:27,389 --> 00:30:28,568
I just feel, I feel fat,

688
00:30:28,569 --> 00:30:31,695
like I had rolls hanging
over those gold shorts.

689
00:30:31,763 --> 00:30:33,330
But you're in perfect shape, dude.

690
00:30:34,167 --> 00:30:35,274
Wait, since I said

691
00:30:35,275 --> 00:30:36,855
I'm uncomfortable in
the tighty-whities,

692
00:30:36,856 --> 00:30:38,311
does that mean I'm gonna
get replaced next?

693
00:30:38,312 --> 00:30:39,548
No, you don't have
to worry about that.

694
00:30:39,549 --> 00:30:41,020
The "Brad" part isn't
about looking hot.

695
00:30:41,021 --> 00:30:43,596
It's about being confident in
who you are and how you look,

696
00:30:43,597 --> 00:30:45,083
no matter how douchey you are.

697
00:30:45,410 --> 00:30:47,727
That's guy's totally
cool being uncool.

698
00:30:48,080 --> 00:30:49,919
Yeah, I'm definitely not there.

699
00:30:50,193 --> 00:30:52,193
I actually started
showering with my shirt on.

700
00:30:52,194 --> 00:30:53,464
Look, stop knocking
yourself out in here.

701
00:30:53,465 --> 00:30:56,462
Just be you and the
sexy will flow through.

702
00:30:56,463 --> 00:30:57,441
Yeah.

703
00:30:58,692 --> 00:31:00,038
Yeah, you're right.

704
00:31:02,209 --> 00:31:04,470
I don't need to hide behind
my muscles, like you do.

705
00:31:04,471 --> 00:31:05,228
Awesome.

706
00:31:06,692 --> 00:31:07,407
I think.

707
00:31:07,623 --> 00:31:08,731
Are you insulting me?

708
00:31:09,067 --> 00:31:10,300
Where are you going?

709
00:31:11,486 --> 00:31:13,924
To show everyone how
hot and sexy I am.

710
00:31:19,644 --> 00:31:20,965
Oh, wow.

711
00:31:21,325 --> 00:31:23,861
Damn those cool ranch doritos.

712
00:31:23,973 --> 00:31:26,973
Eddie... I've seen him.

713
00:31:27,085 --> 00:31:28,326
Eddie?

714
00:31:28,327 --> 00:31:31,597
What do you know of Eddie,
Dr. Scott?

715
00:31:31,598 --> 00:31:32,823
I happen to know a great deal

716
00:31:32,824 --> 00:31:34,200
about a lot of things.

717
00:31:34,201 --> 00:31:35,377
You see...

718
00:31:35,605 --> 00:31:38,395
Eddie happens to be my nephew.

719
00:31:38,953 --> 00:31:40,123
This play is terrible.

720
00:31:40,124 --> 00:31:41,524
Finn's line: "Dr. Scott!"

721
00:31:42,152 --> 00:31:42,860
Janet!

722
00:31:42,861 --> 00:31:44,695
Dr. Scott! Will:
Finn's line: "Janet!"

723
00:31:44,696 --> 00:31:46,442
I'm so bored I just
fell into a micro-sleep.

724
00:31:46,443 --> 00:31:47,736
Brad! Rocky!

725
00:31:48,594 --> 00:31:50,939
Janet. Dr. Scott!

726
00:31:50,940 --> 00:31:52,176
Still being Finn: "Janet!"

727
00:31:52,177 --> 00:31:54,077
Brad! None of this is plausible.

728
00:31:54,078 --> 00:31:54,979
Rocky!

729
00:31:55,692 --> 00:31:56,960
Janet! Dr. Scott!

730
00:31:56,961 --> 00:31:58,558
Finn's line: "Janet!" Brad!

731
00:31:58,559 --> 00:31:59,274
Rocky.

732
00:32:00,378 --> 00:32:02,469
This play has incredible
pacing problems.

733
00:32:02,470 --> 00:32:04,063
Mr. Shue, it is pointless

734
00:32:04,064 --> 00:32:05,815
to rehearse this
scene without Finn.

735
00:32:05,816 --> 00:32:06,765
We don't have a choice.

736
00:32:06,766 --> 00:32:08,280
He's late and he's not
answering his phone.

737
00:32:08,281 --> 00:32:10,177
We gotta get this
timing down, guys.

738
00:32:10,720 --> 00:32:14,406
And would you please stop
interjecting your opinions, Sue?

739
00:32:14,407 --> 00:32:16,665
Opinions? These are my rewrites.

740
00:32:17,094 --> 00:32:20,266
William, I'd like to see
you in my office, please.

741
00:32:22,971 --> 00:32:24,395
Suspended? For what?

742
00:32:25,967 --> 00:32:28,858
I sort of walked down the hall
in my Rocky Horror costume.

743
00:32:46,051 --> 00:32:48,671
Whoa! Nice panties, baby Huey!

744
00:32:48,672 --> 00:32:50,238
Hey, my grandpa Murray called.

745
00:32:50,239 --> 00:32:51,845
He wants his boxers back.

746
00:32:56,192 --> 00:32:57,349
Why would you do that?

747
00:32:57,350 --> 00:32:59,584
I was trying to get
comfortable in my costume.

748
00:32:59,585 --> 00:33:01,435
You don't understand how
hard it is for us guys

749
00:33:01,436 --> 00:33:03,065
to be exposed like that.

750
00:33:03,672 --> 00:33:05,889
Just thought maybe it would
make me feel hot enough

751
00:33:05,890 --> 00:33:08,106
to get up on stage and
sing in my underwear.

752
00:33:08,107 --> 00:33:10,250
I'm recommending one
month's suspension

753
00:33:10,251 --> 00:33:14,472
and summer school to make
up for any lost class time.

754
00:33:14,646 --> 00:33:16,561
Can we have a moment alone please?

755
00:33:20,250 --> 00:33:21,571
You can't do this to him.

756
00:33:21,572 --> 00:33:23,074
He was just coming to
rehearsal in his costume...

757
00:33:23,075 --> 00:33:24,136
that's not a crime.

758
00:33:24,137 --> 00:33:26,401
Nine children have
already signed up

759
00:33:26,402 --> 00:33:27,698
for after-school therapy.

760
00:33:27,699 --> 00:33:29,548
I had to bring in
a grief counselor.

761
00:33:29,549 --> 00:33:31,875
Last year when the cheerios!
Won the national championship,

762
00:33:31,876 --> 00:33:33,233
Santana pantsed Brittany,

763
00:33:33,234 --> 00:33:35,711
and she was wearing a lot
less than her underwear.

764
00:33:35,762 --> 00:33:37,110
Neither of them were suspended.

765
00:33:37,111 --> 00:33:39,210
That was in the middle
of a celebration.

766
00:33:39,211 --> 00:33:41,355
But there's still a precedent.

767
00:33:41,356 --> 00:33:41,986
Huh?

768
00:33:41,987 --> 00:33:43,764
Fine. A warning.

769
00:33:43,765 --> 00:33:44,654
Thank you.

770
00:33:44,655 --> 00:33:45,722
William?

771
00:33:46,295 --> 00:33:47,348
To be honest,

772
00:33:47,349 --> 00:33:50,425
your motivations for doing this
production are murky to me,

773
00:33:50,426 --> 00:33:52,235
considering all
that you're risking

774
00:33:52,236 --> 00:33:53,814
if something goes too far.

775
00:33:53,815 --> 00:33:54,637
What are you saying?

776
00:33:54,638 --> 00:33:56,678
I'm saying that you're welcome
to continue with this,

777
00:33:56,679 --> 00:33:58,687
but if you get any heat about it,

778
00:33:58,688 --> 00:34:00,372
I won't be able to protect you.

779
00:34:00,373 --> 00:34:02,411
You're putting you
and your glee club

780
00:34:02,412 --> 00:34:05,145
on the line,
and I want you to be sure

781
00:34:05,146 --> 00:34:07,767
that whatever you're
doing it for is worth it.

782
00:34:11,783 --> 00:34:13,196
Finn & Rachel: *There's a... *

783
00:34:13,197 --> 00:34:14,044
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa!

784
00:34:14,045 --> 00:34:16,512
Schuester, you messing
with my woman?

785
00:34:16,513 --> 00:34:17,795
I thought we had a deal.

786
00:34:18,918 --> 00:34:19,975
I, uh...

787
00:34:19,976 --> 00:34:21,538
I-I-I don't know what
you're talking about.

788
00:34:21,539 --> 00:34:22,447
Yes, you do,

789
00:34:22,448 --> 00:34:23,060
because Emma and I have

790
00:34:23,061 --> 00:34:25,732
a full disclosure policy...
total honesty.

791
00:34:25,733 --> 00:34:26,881
Something that allows us
to have a little thing

792
00:34:26,882 --> 00:34:28,868
I like to call intimacy.

793
00:34:28,869 --> 00:34:30,701
Something you clearly
know nothing about.

794
00:34:30,957 --> 00:34:32,261
Look, we were just rehearsing.

795
00:34:32,262 --> 00:34:33,439
Stop it, bro.

796
00:34:33,638 --> 00:34:35,586
Man-to-man, you gave me your word.

797
00:34:35,886 --> 00:34:37,414
So, what, you quitting the show?

798
00:34:37,415 --> 00:34:38,335
No, no, no, no.

799
00:34:38,336 --> 00:34:40,451
Unlike you I believe in
the power of the arts.

800
00:34:40,452 --> 00:34:42,713
I don't just use them to
pick up other guys' chicks.

801
00:34:54,659 --> 00:34:56,126
Trick or treat!

802
00:34:57,075 --> 00:35:01,288
Oh, geez, Becky, I forgot that
"take back the night club"

803
00:35:01,289 --> 00:35:02,996
was going door-to-door
this evening.

804
00:35:02,997 --> 00:35:04,800
I want my chocolate bar.

805
00:35:04,801 --> 00:35:06,223
I'm sorry.

806
00:35:06,224 --> 00:35:08,074
I've been working so
hard on Rocky Horror,

807
00:35:08,075 --> 00:35:09,741
I forgot to buy candy.

808
00:35:09,742 --> 00:35:13,090
Rocky Horror is an abomination.

809
00:35:14,838 --> 00:35:16,035
What did you just say?

810
00:35:16,036 --> 00:35:19,080
That's what coach Sue
says on her tape.

811
00:35:19,081 --> 00:35:21,900
It's in her office. I'll show you.

812
00:35:24,703 --> 00:35:26,407
So I went undercover to expose

813
00:35:26,408 --> 00:35:29,034
what your tax dollars are
funding in our public schools

814
00:35:29,035 --> 00:35:31,129
in the name of the arts.

815
00:35:31,484 --> 00:35:33,499
Now, I'm all about
personal freedom.

816
00:35:33,500 --> 00:35:34,775
I've publicly voiced my support

817
00:35:34,776 --> 00:35:37,363
for that lady who wants
to marry her own sores.

818
00:35:37,364 --> 00:35:39,840
But just because you're free
to say whatever you want,

819
00:35:39,841 --> 00:35:41,509
doesn't always mean you should.

820
00:35:41,510 --> 00:35:44,175
Artists are free to push
boundaries to make art.

821
00:35:44,176 --> 00:35:46,486
But when pushing boundaries
is their only aim,

822
00:35:46,487 --> 00:35:48,354
the result is usually bad art.

823
00:35:48,355 --> 00:35:50,187
There's a time and a
place for everything,

824
00:35:50,188 --> 00:35:51,362
and squeamishness about what

825
00:35:51,363 --> 00:35:54,750
we want our children exposed
to is not the same as bigotry.

826
00:35:54,751 --> 00:35:56,744
Freedom-loving adults are
free to have an open,

827
00:35:56,745 --> 00:35:59,909
lively debate about what
we want our society to be.

828
00:35:59,910 --> 00:36:03,630
But let's not make our children
fight the culture war for us.

829
00:36:03,719 --> 00:36:05,589
They deserve a little
bit better than that.

830
00:36:05,642 --> 00:36:08,516
And that's... how Sue sees it.

831
00:36:08,956 --> 00:36:12,486
Give me chocolate
or I will cut you.

832
00:36:18,212 --> 00:36:20,415
Sue, you set me up.

833
00:36:20,416 --> 00:36:21,367
Hey, there, William.

834
00:36:21,368 --> 00:36:23,266
Root through anyone's
personal belongings lately?

835
00:36:23,267 --> 00:36:24,529
When were you planning
on airing that?

836
00:36:24,530 --> 00:36:26,688
Opening night.
That's why I pretaped it.

837
00:36:26,931 --> 00:36:28,667
Oh, I know you're furious, Will.

838
00:36:29,038 --> 00:36:30,354
But do you honestly believe

839
00:36:30,355 --> 00:36:33,080
anything I said was unreasonable?

840
00:36:33,081 --> 00:36:34,008
Well...

841
00:36:36,501 --> 00:36:37,377
No.

842
00:36:37,671 --> 00:36:40,337
There are limits, Will.
There is a line.

843
00:36:40,338 --> 00:36:43,161
And for reasons I suspect have
nothing to do with your kids,

844
00:36:43,162 --> 00:36:44,353
you crossed it.

845
00:36:45,109 --> 00:36:46,329
You can't yell fire

846
00:36:46,330 --> 00:36:48,413
in a crowded theatre,
and you can't expose kids

847
00:36:48,414 --> 00:36:49,548
to material like this.

848
00:36:49,549 --> 00:36:51,021
Not on the taxpayer's dime.

849
00:36:51,022 --> 00:36:52,272
Oh, please, Sue!

850
00:36:52,842 --> 00:36:54,688
They have the Internet.
They are exposed!

851
00:36:54,689 --> 00:36:55,617
Don't lead them to it.

852
00:36:55,618 --> 00:36:57,897
Don't make it okay. They're kids!

853
00:36:57,898 --> 00:36:59,039
And now more than ever,
high school is

854
00:36:59,040 --> 00:37:00,989
a dangerous place,
and it's our job

855
00:37:00,990 --> 00:37:02,946
to guide them through it safely.

856
00:37:02,947 --> 00:37:04,653
And we still get to torture
them along the way.

857
00:37:04,654 --> 00:37:06,393
It's a fabulous system.

858
00:37:10,715 --> 00:37:11,597
You're right.

859
00:37:13,057 --> 00:37:14,688
I-I'm pulling the show.

860
00:37:15,406 --> 00:37:16,486
Wait. What?

861
00:37:16,487 --> 00:37:18,041
I'm canceling the show.

862
00:37:18,042 --> 00:37:20,037
You were right.
I was totally wrong.

863
00:37:20,038 --> 00:37:21,464
Well, shouldn't you wait
until opening night?

864
00:37:21,465 --> 00:37:23,312
I mean, the kids worked
so hard... sorry, Sue.

865
00:37:23,313 --> 00:37:25,062
Hey, do it for the kids, Will.

866
00:37:25,554 --> 00:37:27,948
I need that local Emmy, Will!

867
00:37:32,439 --> 00:37:34,675
Are you sure you want to
cancel the whole thing?

868
00:37:35,026 --> 00:37:37,461
I never should've tried to
put it on in the first place.

869
00:37:39,158 --> 00:37:41,183
The reality is...

870
00:37:41,888 --> 00:37:44,358
I only did all this
to get close to you.

871
00:37:47,102 --> 00:37:50,174
I guess love can make you
do some crazy things.

872
00:37:50,425 --> 00:37:51,385
You know?

873
00:37:54,897 --> 00:37:56,675
I'm sorry, Emma.

874
00:37:56,676 --> 00:38:01,143
And I promise to never abuse our
feelings for each other again.

875
00:38:01,144 --> 00:38:02,331
I mean, let's face it.

876
00:38:03,014 --> 00:38:04,938
Carl's actually making you better.

877
00:38:07,298 --> 00:38:09,072
And if I really love you...

878
00:38:11,266 --> 00:38:13,396
...I need to back off and
accept the fact that...

879
00:38:15,597 --> 00:38:16,899
At least for now,

880
00:38:18,158 --> 00:38:19,268
being with him

881
00:38:20,293 --> 00:38:21,840
is the best thing for you.

882
00:38:27,017 --> 00:38:29,020
So, what are you going
to tell the kids?

883
00:38:34,362 --> 00:38:35,661
I want to apologize

884
00:38:35,662 --> 00:38:37,441
for putting you guys
through all this...

885
00:38:37,687 --> 00:38:39,329
particularly Finn and Sam.

886
00:38:39,330 --> 00:38:40,506
It's cool, Mr. Shue.

887
00:38:40,507 --> 00:38:41,926
I'm sure the teasing will die down

888
00:38:41,927 --> 00:38:43,899
by the time my tenth
reunion rolls around.

889
00:38:43,900 --> 00:38:45,460
And I got asked to be June

890
00:38:45,461 --> 00:38:46,877
in the men of McKinley
high calendar.

891
00:38:46,878 --> 00:38:48,058
I'm happy for you.

892
00:38:49,386 --> 00:38:51,029
But we still can't do the musical.

893
00:38:51,253 --> 00:38:52,224
Look, I was wrong.

894
00:38:52,329 --> 00:38:53,112
Rocky Horror isn't

895
00:38:53,113 --> 00:38:57,419
about pushing boundaries or
making an audience accept

896
00:38:57,420 --> 00:38:59,127
a certain rebellious
point of view.

897
00:38:59,354 --> 00:39:00,876
Those were my reasons
for doing it,

898
00:39:01,295 --> 00:39:03,703
and they aren't worth risking
what we have here for.

899
00:39:06,567 --> 00:39:07,750
And when I was younger,

900
00:39:07,751 --> 00:39:09,879
and they started midnight
shows of Rocky Horror,

901
00:39:09,880 --> 00:39:11,760
it wasn't for envelope pushers.

902
00:39:12,617 --> 00:39:14,048
It was for outcasts,

903
00:39:14,297 --> 00:39:15,949
people on the fringes
who had no place

904
00:39:15,950 --> 00:39:18,507
left to go, but were
searching for someplace,

905
00:39:18,508 --> 00:39:21,234
anyplace, where they
felt like they belonged.

906
00:39:21,968 --> 00:39:23,022
Sound familiar?

907
00:39:25,291 --> 00:39:28,078
The truth is,
with that perspective,

908
00:39:28,985 --> 00:39:31,352
Rocky Horror is the perfect
show for this club.

909
00:39:31,353 --> 00:39:33,177
Well, then why aren't
we putting it on?

910
00:39:34,330 --> 00:39:36,156
We're still going to
perform Rocky Horror.

911
00:39:37,150 --> 00:39:38,971
We're just not doing
it for an audience.

912
00:39:38,972 --> 00:39:40,411
We're doing it for ourselves.

913
00:39:44,285 --> 00:39:46,820
It's astounding.

914
00:39:46,821 --> 00:39:49,466
Time is fleeting.

915
00:39:50,264 --> 00:39:54,346
Madness... takes its toll.

916
00:39:54,988 --> 00:39:57,318
But listen closely.

917
00:39:57,319 --> 00:40:00,072
Not for very much longer.

918
00:40:01,193 --> 00:40:05,109
I've got to keep control.

919
00:40:06,038 --> 00:40:10,541
* I remember doing the time-warp *

920
00:40:11,971 --> 00:40:15,770
* Drinking those moments when *

921
00:40:16,356 --> 00:40:18,801
* The blackness would hit me *

922
00:40:18,905 --> 00:40:21,967
*And a void would be calling *

923
00:40:22,719 --> 00:40:26,398
* Let's do the time-warp again *

924
00:40:28,282 --> 00:40:32,049
* Let's do the time-warp again! *

925
00:40:32,552 --> 00:40:34,359
It's just a jump to the left.

926
00:40:35,930 --> 00:40:38,628
* And then a step to the right *

927
00:40:38,629 --> 00:40:40,208
Put your hands on your hips.

928
00:40:41,270 --> 00:40:43,735
* You bring your knees in tight *

929
00:40:46,638 --> 00:40:49,549
That really drives you insane *

930
00:40:50,710 --> 00:40:54,392
* Let's do the time-warp again *

931
00:40:56,017 --> 00:41:00,659
* Let's do the time-warp again *

932
00:41:00,874 --> 00:41:03,347
* It's so dreamy *

933
00:41:03,348 --> 00:41:06,025
* Oh, fantasy free me *

934
00:41:06,239 --> 00:41:10,833
* So you can't see me,
no, not at all *

935
00:41:11,470 --> 00:41:14,098
* In another dimension *

936
00:41:14,099 --> 00:41:17,239
* With voyeuristic intentions *

937
00:41:17,500 --> 00:41:22,091
* Well secluded, oh,
I see it all *

938
00:41:22,726 --> 00:41:25,372
With a bit of a mind flip.

939
00:41:25,373 --> 00:41:28,820
You're into the time slip.

940
00:41:28,821 --> 00:41:33,094
And nothing can ever be the same.

941
00:41:33,471 --> 00:41:36,526
* You're spaced out
on sensation, ow! *

942
00:41:36,527 --> 00:41:39,718
* Like you're under sedation *

943
00:41:40,544 --> 00:41:43,850
* Let's do the time-warp again *

944
00:41:45,936 --> 00:41:49,820
* Let's do the time-warp again *

945
00:41:50,908 --> 00:41:53,582
* Well, I was walking down the
street just a-having a think *

946
00:41:53,583 --> 00:41:56,543
* When this snake of a guy
gave me an evil wink *

947
00:41:56,544 --> 00:41:58,960
* He shook me up,
he took me by surprise *

948
00:41:58,961 --> 00:42:02,000
* He had a pickup truck,
and the devil's eyes *

949
00:42:02,001 --> 00:42:04,658
* He stared at me and
I felt a change *

950
00:42:04,659 --> 00:42:07,619
* Time meant nothing,
never would again *

951
00:42:07,620 --> 00:42:12,457
* Let's do the time-warp again *

952
00:42:13,102 --> 00:42:16,995
* Let's do the time-warp again *

953
00:42:17,402 --> 00:42:19,048
It's just a jump to the left.

954
00:42:20,579 --> 00:42:23,400
* And then a step to the right *

955
00:42:23,401 --> 00:42:25,058
Put your hands on your hips.

956
00:42:26,057 --> 00:42:28,544
* You bring your knees in tight *

957
00:42:28,720 --> 00:42:30,938
* But it's the pelvic thrust

958
00:42:31,386 --> 00:42:33,826
that really drives you insane *

959
00:42:35,316 --> 00:42:39,351
* Let's do the time-warp again *

960
00:42:40,780 --> 00:42:44,331
* Let's do the time-warp again. *
