1
00:00:12,113 --> 00:00:17,297
Great Freedom No. 7

2
00:01:26,006 --> 00:01:29,115
Jens! Man, where are you?

3
00:01:29,200 --> 00:01:31,234
I thought you're ready
but you're sitting here

4
00:01:31,235 --> 00:01:32,456
looking at the moon?

5
00:01:32,576 --> 00:01:36,032
When that bloke plays <i>La Paloma</i>
I always have to think of Hannes.

6
00:01:36,152 --> 00:01:37,856
You call that whining "play"?

7
00:01:37,976 --> 00:01:40,914
I play at least as good
as he can whistle.

8
00:01:41,332 --> 00:01:43,363
<i>Hannes</i> could play.

9
00:01:43,483 --> 00:01:47,527
Jens, could he play? That was
like an orchestra when he got going.

10
00:01:47,647 --> 00:01:49,147
Hannes' kind of a magical animal, I know...

11
00:01:49,267 --> 00:01:51,754
Whatever he does, he can do it
in any case better than I...

12
00:01:51,874 --> 00:01:54,454
Of course he can, freshwater Harry!

13
00:01:55,743 --> 00:01:59,007
Only one thing he could not:
stay on board as a sailor.

14
00:01:59,127 --> 00:02:00,557
Because he didn't want to, dimwit.

15
00:02:00,677 --> 00:02:02,475
'Cause he didn't want!

16
00:02:02,595 --> 00:02:05,152
Hannes is the uncrowned king
of the Great Freedom!

17
00:02:05,272 --> 00:02:07,222
Someone like that
can't hold a candle to him!

18
00:02:07,342 --> 00:02:09,526
- Hannes <i>can</i>, if he wants!
- He can kiss my...

19
00:02:09,646 --> 00:02:11,522
He's got a whole other prospects, eh!

20
00:02:11,642 --> 00:02:14,936
- Now how long do I have to wait for you?
- Where do you want to go?

21
00:02:15,056 --> 00:02:17,648
You're asking questions...!

22
00:02:17,768 --> 00:02:20,325
- To the Great Freedom, mate!
- To Hannes of course!

23
00:02:20,445 --> 00:02:23,049
- Without me then.
- Ever heard a thing like that?

24
00:02:23,169 --> 00:02:26,621
Seven months he wasn't in Hamburg,
and doesn't want to go ashore?

25
00:02:26,741 --> 00:02:28,552
You and your Hamburg...

26
00:02:28,672 --> 00:02:31,394
guess it's the same bang business
as in any other port,

27
00:02:31,514 --> 00:02:34,496
be it Frisco,
Valparaiso or Shanghai.

28
00:02:34,880 --> 00:02:38,950
You oughta come to Cologne!
<i>That's</i> where the fun is!

29
00:02:40,046 --> 00:02:42,324
<i>Cologne</i>?... Jens -

30
00:02:42,444 --> 00:02:44,097
do <i>you</i> know <i>Cologne</i>?

31
00:02:44,217 --> 00:02:46,487
<i>Cologne</i>?
No.

32
00:02:46,607 --> 00:02:48,871
Never heard of.

33
00:02:49,118 --> 00:02:50,327
What?

34
00:02:54,789 --> 00:02:55,966
Yep...

35
00:02:56,086 --> 00:03:00,135
...think I'll come along
and embosom your Hamburg.

36
00:03:00,255 --> 00:03:03,176
Speaking of bosoms...

37
00:03:03,296 --> 00:03:06,400
I hope you're morally steadfast?
Mate, the Hamburg girls...!

38
00:03:06,520 --> 00:03:10,248
If any of your Hamburg girls appeals
to me, you can call me <i>Kasimir</i>.

39
00:03:10,368 --> 00:03:12,667
Well if we were in Cologne now...!

40
00:03:53,300 --> 00:03:56,611
See you!
<i>Kasimir!</i>

41
00:04:20,603 --> 00:04:22,822
Hey... that's Hannes!

42
00:04:22,942 --> 00:04:24,551
<i>...your blonde hair</i>

43
00:04:24,671 --> 00:04:27,976
<i>...dyed black, or maybe red.</i>

44
00:04:28,096 --> 00:04:31,276
<i>And when a young stranger
is greeting you</i>

45
00:04:31,396 --> 00:04:34,751
<i>when passing by
and you don't know him,</i>

46
00:04:34,871 --> 00:04:38,793
<i>maybe you will remember again</i>

47
00:04:38,913 --> 00:04:43,507
<i>when he softly speaks to you:</i>

48
00:04:44,723 --> 00:04:51,916
<i>Come, my little darling,
please be mine, don't say no!</i>

49
00:04:52,036 --> 00:05:00,081
<i>Until tomorrow morning at nine
you shall be my only one.</i>

50
00:05:00,201 --> 00:05:07,048
<i>If you want I'll be true to you
till the evening at half past nine!</i>

51
00:05:07,168 --> 00:05:11,312
<i>Link arms with me,
we'll go strolling together now</i>

52
00:05:11,432 --> 00:05:15,434
<i>...through the night!</i>

53
00:05:16,045 --> 00:05:16,752
All now!

54
00:05:16,872 --> 00:05:21,992
<i>On the Reeperbahn
at half past midnight</i>

55
00:05:22,112 --> 00:05:25,145
<i>whether you've got a girl or not</i>

56
00:05:25,265 --> 00:05:28,574
<i>you enjoy yourself,
it will sort itself out

57
00:05:28,694 --> 00:05:31,706
<i>on the Reeperbahn
at half past midnight!</i>

58
00:05:31,826 --> 00:05:38,198
<i>One who's never been in a cozy night
strolling up and down the Reeperbahn,</i>

59
00:05:38,318 --> 00:05:41,509
<i>is a poor wretch,
for he hasn't seen</i>

60
00:05:41,629 --> 00:05:46,233
<i>my St. Pauli,
St. Pauli by night!</i>

61
00:05:52,461 --> 00:05:55,279
Before the next riding tour starts

62
00:05:55,399 --> 00:05:58,730
a snappy triple fanfare
for my friends

63
00:05:58,850 --> 00:06:01,537
Fiete Brinkmann, ship's cook -

64
00:06:01,657 --> 00:06:05,787
and Jens Peersen -
able-bodied seaman of the Padua!

65
00:06:12,701 --> 00:06:16,626
<i>And when we come to Hamburg, we know
what we will do,</i>   - All sing along!

66
00:06:16,746 --> 00:06:20,196
<i>we'll buy us one for fifteen pence
at the corner of David Street.</i>

67
00:06:20,316 --> 00:06:23,648
<i>Hurray, hurray,
hurray, hurray, hurray,</i>

68
00:06:23,768 --> 00:06:27,277
<i>and when our pay's all blown,
we'll go to sea again.</i>

69
00:06:29,695 --> 00:06:32,609
Riding is fun!
Riding gives pleasure!

70
00:06:32,729 --> 00:06:34,298
Jens, Fiete!

71
00:06:35,418 --> 00:06:38,022
Come here, come here, girl!

72
00:06:38,142 --> 00:06:40,142
Mount!

73
00:06:40,262 --> 00:06:44,470


74
00:06:44,590 --> 00:06:47,567
Let's have a drink!

75
00:06:47,687 --> 00:06:49,763
Wait a moment...
Madam...?

76
00:06:49,883 --> 00:06:52,240
- I've spoken with the director
of the Hansa Theater...   - Fine.

77
00:06:52,360 --> 00:06:55,352
- See you later?
- Sure. Without?

78
00:06:55,472 --> 00:06:58,322
- Sure.   - All right.
- I'll be waiting in the car outside.

79
00:06:58,442 --> 00:06:59,731
Anita!

80
00:06:59,851 --> 00:07:02,819
- I've known you for fifteen years!
- At least!

81
00:07:02,939 --> 00:07:06,189
- And you're looking better each time!
- You really think so?

82
00:07:07,739 --> 00:07:10,697
Get ready for the next tour!

83
00:07:11,000 --> 00:07:13,766
Say, what was that all about
in the loge, with the lady?

84
00:07:13,886 --> 00:07:15,739
What could have been? Nothing!

85
00:07:15,859 --> 00:07:18,005
- Better watch it, chap!
- Now don't make a fuss, will you?

86
00:07:18,125 --> 00:07:20,447
- Better come out with some good rum!
- Some <i>good</i>?

87
00:07:20,567 --> 00:07:22,626
Yes, some <i>good</i>!
You've gotta be kidding!

88
00:07:22,746 --> 00:07:26,080
For two scoundrels as you
I spare no expenses!

89
00:07:26,853 --> 00:07:28,226
Hannes...

90
00:07:29,530 --> 00:07:30,786
Here...

91
00:07:32,417 --> 00:07:34,225
But that's...
that's our Padua!

92
00:07:34,345 --> 00:07:36,409
Yes, I made it for you, Hannes!

93
00:07:36,529 --> 00:07:39,826
- We did, we!    - We?
- Here, read: "from Jens and Fiete".

94
00:07:39,946 --> 00:07:41,599
Now what did <i>you</i> do at it?

95
00:07:41,719 --> 00:07:44,645
I drank up the bottle! Otherwise
you couldn't have put in the ship!

96
00:07:45,649 --> 00:07:49,104
Well, Jens? Well, Fiete?
How was the trip?

97
00:07:49,224 --> 00:07:52,009
Record, eh! 68 days from
Spencerport to Cape Lizard!

98
00:07:52,129 --> 00:07:54,005
Man alive, eh!
That's quite something...

99
00:07:54,125 --> 00:07:56,612
Our old Padua went along
like some sewing machine.

100
00:07:56,732 --> 00:07:59,157
The old man was pretty
rough on the tub, eh!

101
00:07:59,277 --> 00:08:02,034
At each watch there was
at least once "all hands on deck".

102
00:08:02,154 --> 00:08:05,099
At the Cape, we didn't get out
of our wet rags for four days.

103
00:08:05,219 --> 00:08:07,247
Cooking? I couldn't
even think of cooking...

104
00:08:07,367 --> 00:08:09,978
And the green water
stood on deck all the time...

105
00:08:13,782 --> 00:08:15,895
Hannes...

106
00:08:16,015 --> 00:08:19,611
on this voyage
you were missed, man.

107
00:08:23,341 --> 00:08:24,872
Where's the rum?

108
00:08:24,992 --> 00:08:27,746
Anita, I ordered three rum!

109
00:08:27,866 --> 00:08:29,545
Cheers all!

110
00:08:29,665 --> 00:08:31,790
Jens... Fiete...

111
00:08:32,804 --> 00:08:34,335
come 'ere... Cheers!

112
00:08:37,228 --> 00:08:39,063
All ready for the ride!

113
00:08:39,183 --> 00:08:40,808
On your mark... ready...

114
00:08:41,740 --> 00:08:43,664
Who says "ready"?
No one's saying ready!

115
00:08:43,784 --> 00:08:45,838
If anyone here says ready,
It's we saying ready!

116
00:08:45,958 --> 00:08:48,870
Fiete ready? Jens ready?
All READY!

117
00:08:53,326 --> 00:08:56,491
Say, is that still
the same old donkey?

118
00:08:56,766 --> 00:08:58,765
- Sure!
- Eh, Hannes....

119
00:08:58,885 --> 00:09:00,465
Who's she?

120
00:09:00,585 --> 00:09:02,841
- That's Margot.
- Never saw her here before!

121
00:09:02,961 --> 00:09:05,787
You can't...
She's been here for only six weeks.

122
00:09:05,907 --> 00:09:08,073
- Cute...
- Looks damn feeble.

123
00:09:08,193 --> 00:09:10,942
- What, Margot?
- No, the ass!

124
00:09:13,270 --> 00:09:16,558
Hannes! You're to come
to the harbor hospital.

125
00:09:19,374 --> 00:09:23,197
- Say, what am I to do there?
- It's about your brother...

126
00:09:24,681 --> 00:09:27,490
My brother? He can kiss my...

127
00:09:27,610 --> 00:09:29,690
He can go jump in a lake!

128
00:09:29,810 --> 00:09:32,978
The nurse says
he is nearing his end...

129
00:09:35,145 --> 00:09:37,030
- Hannes...
- What?

130
00:09:37,641 --> 00:09:40,424
In that case... Hannes...

131
00:09:46,090 --> 00:09:47,691
Well alright...

132
00:09:54,247 --> 00:09:57,161
Is the old issue between them
still not straightened out?

133
00:09:57,281 --> 00:09:58,509
That will never be sorted out, man.

134
00:09:58,629 --> 00:10:02,837
Up next is the famous ride
on the donkey Bimbo!

135
00:10:02,957 --> 00:10:06,061
The management will pay
10 mark to any person

136
00:10:06,181 --> 00:10:09,845
who succeeds in riding three times
around the arena without bucking off.

137
00:10:09,965 --> 00:10:13,368
Kicking, hitting and biting on
the part of the rider is not allowed!

138
00:10:13,488 --> 00:10:15,823
- I'll ride him.   - Don't...
- I'll ride him!   - Fiete, don't!

139
00:10:15,943 --> 00:10:19,158
That 10 marks are for the son of
the old Brinkmann!   - Fiete, no...!

140
00:10:36,438 --> 00:10:38,379
Nice tiles...!

141
00:10:58,393 --> 00:10:59,670
Hannes...

142
00:11:01,521 --> 00:11:03,590
gotta help me, Hannes.

143
00:11:03,853 --> 00:11:06,353
Ah. Again.

144
00:11:06,473 --> 00:11:07,556
No.

145
00:11:07,676 --> 00:11:09,808
But it's... not for me.

146
00:11:11,866 --> 00:11:13,904
I'm finished.

147
00:11:14,186 --> 00:11:15,717
Gisa...

148
00:11:16,272 --> 00:11:19,255
the girl's... still waiting for me.

149
00:11:22,092 --> 00:11:27,126
I wrote... everything down.

150
00:11:30,333 --> 00:11:32,353
- ...Address...
- No.

151
00:11:32,473 --> 00:11:34,184
I've always helped you...

152
00:11:34,304 --> 00:11:37,030
I gave you all my savings,
so that you could go to naval school,

153
00:11:37,150 --> 00:11:39,416
and what did you do with the money?

154
00:11:39,735 --> 00:11:41,276
You blew it.

155
00:11:41,396 --> 00:11:44,507
And I had to slog on
as a plain sailor.

156
00:11:44,627 --> 00:11:48,516
And keep on grindind my bones,
and for whom? For you!

157
00:11:49,690 --> 00:11:53,616
Then I saved again, because I also
wanted to go to naval school, yeah...

158
00:11:55,705 --> 00:11:58,341
and when I was in Australia
with the Padua,

159
00:11:58,461 --> 00:12:01,966
you secretly went to my locker,
guess you still remember, no?

160
00:12:02,086 --> 00:12:05,949
Second drawer bottom left,
under the hankies.

161
00:12:06,201 --> 00:12:09,339
There you simply stole my money!

162
00:12:14,848 --> 00:12:16,962
Then mother fell ill,

163
00:12:17,082 --> 00:12:19,643
and you didn't even look after her.

164
00:12:20,306 --> 00:12:22,989
Then mother died while I was at sea,

165
00:12:23,109 --> 00:12:26,935
and when I came back home
other people had buried her.

166
00:12:27,055 --> 00:12:29,093
I won't forget that for all my life,

167
00:12:29,213 --> 00:12:33,170
With a rascal as you I don't
want to have anything to do any more!

168
00:12:41,405 --> 00:12:43,965
You ruined me!

169
00:12:45,926 --> 00:12:49,583
And because I didn't want to start
from the beginning for the third time

170
00:12:49,936 --> 00:12:53,678
I did stay on land,
where I do not belong at all...

171
00:12:54,174 --> 00:12:57,145
with Anita at the Great Freedom.

172
00:12:58,049 --> 00:13:01,352
No, man -
as long as we're both alive...

173
00:13:01,472 --> 00:13:04,435
we no longer have anything...

174
00:14:02,363 --> 00:14:03,761
What's with him?

175
00:14:03,881 --> 00:14:05,980
I think he's afraid!

176
00:14:49,868 --> 00:14:53,689
<i>Gisa Häuptlein... market garden</i>

177
00:15:12,352 --> 00:15:14,101
Cashier, please!

178
00:15:16,649 --> 00:15:18,610
What do you say now?

179
00:15:23,851 --> 00:15:25,990
What's your name anyway?

180
00:15:26,110 --> 00:15:28,679
- Jens Peersen...
- Jens?

181
00:15:28,799 --> 00:15:30,863
Oh, now that's
a beautiful name, isn't it?

182
00:15:30,983 --> 00:15:35,031
Yes, true enough!
Beautiful people have beautiful names!

183
00:15:35,900 --> 00:15:39,937
- God, you're so pretty!
- When did you sign off, eh?

184
00:15:40,057 --> 00:15:42,974
This morning!
Smokestack's burning, baby, eh!

185
00:15:43,094 --> 00:15:45,719
Jens Peersen's going mighty
strong on his chest again!

186
00:15:45,839 --> 00:15:49,676
Oh Jens... I really like strong men!

187
00:15:50,040 --> 00:15:52,824
6... 8... 10.
Check!

188
00:15:53,799 --> 00:15:57,239
Say, Fiete... who told you
the trick with Bimbo's tail?

189
00:15:57,359 --> 00:16:00,456
Trick?
I seee...!

190
00:16:00,576 --> 00:16:02,817
That was a trick?

191
00:16:03,163 --> 00:16:05,192
Well, thank you very much!

192
00:16:05,312 --> 00:16:08,881
Anita... when will be the next ride?

193
00:16:12,628 --> 00:16:14,781
Evening, Hannes!

194
00:16:30,005 --> 00:16:32,274
Watch out, Admiral!

195
00:16:35,995 --> 00:16:39,576
<i>The beautiful love in the harbor</i>

196
00:16:39,696 --> 00:16:42,969
<i>the beautiful love at sea</i>

197
00:16:43,089 --> 00:16:46,632
<i>just to sleep once in the harbor</i>

198
00:16:46,752 --> 00:16:49,342
<i>no one wants to say good-bye</i>

199
00:16:50,290 --> 00:16:53,634
<i>The beautiful girls in the harbor</i>

200
00:16:53,754 --> 00:16:57,041
<i>they're not true but they're new...</i>

201
00:16:57,273 --> 00:17:00,150
Hey... give me a double aquavit.

202
00:17:00,270 --> 00:17:02,100
I think you should sing again, Hannes.

203
00:17:02,220 --> 00:17:04,659
That's the sixth round
without intermission.

204
00:17:05,469 --> 00:17:07,746
What about Jan?

205
00:17:10,858 --> 00:17:12,995
Did anything happen?

206
00:17:15,283 --> 00:17:16,775
Hannes!

207
00:17:18,336 --> 00:17:22,283
Here... the sheet anchor
at the foredeck is missing!

208
00:17:22,508 --> 00:17:24,207
Hannes...

209
00:17:44,753 --> 00:17:47,937
- Did anything happen?
- Yes!

210
00:17:48,790 --> 00:17:50,925
One more...

211
00:17:51,757 --> 00:17:53,237
Hannes, you're not going back to sea...?

212
00:17:53,357 --> 00:17:56,980
'Course not - I have to go away for
a few days, because of my brother.

213
00:17:57,455 --> 00:18:01,376
- You'll come back, will you?
- Where else can I go.

214
00:18:03,369 --> 00:18:05,447
Where are you going?

215
00:18:30,379 --> 00:18:32,477
Are you looking for me?

216
00:18:32,856 --> 00:18:34,444
Good morning...! Tcha...

217
00:18:34,564 --> 00:18:37,334
Actually, I came to see
Miss Gisa Häuptlein.

218
00:18:37,454 --> 00:18:39,725
What do you want from my daughter?

219
00:18:39,845 --> 00:18:43,074
It's... I come from Hamburg.

220
00:18:43,194 --> 00:18:45,023
My name is Kröger.

221
00:18:45,143 --> 00:18:47,841
- Kröger... from Hamburg?
- Yes.

222
00:18:48,639 --> 00:18:49,971
I see...

223
00:18:50,905 --> 00:18:52,948
...that's you.

224
00:18:53,677 --> 00:18:55,685
So you're the one, who Gisa...

225
00:18:55,805 --> 00:18:57,740
and you still dare to come here?

226
00:18:57,860 --> 00:19:01,662
Now hold your horses...
I don't even know your daughter.

227
00:19:01,782 --> 00:19:04,618
Oh really...
but back then in Bremen

228
00:19:04,738 --> 00:19:06,925
when Gisa was on a visit
with my sister,

229
00:19:07,045 --> 00:19:08,892
there you knew her quite well, no?

230
00:19:09,012 --> 00:19:11,757
Mrs. Häuptlein, the one
who knew your daughter...

231
00:19:11,877 --> 00:19:14,551
After you had your pleasure
you suddenly disappeared!

232
00:19:14,671 --> 00:19:17,580
and dumped the poor girl - you rascal!

233
00:19:17,700 --> 00:19:19,893
Now would you please calm down!

234
00:19:20,013 --> 00:19:22,629
The one who knew your daughter
was my brother.

235
00:19:22,749 --> 00:19:27,117
And what's been wrong between them they
better should have sorted out themselves!

236
00:19:27,237 --> 00:19:28,600
Jan!

237
00:19:32,095 --> 00:19:34,866
I'm just the elder brother.

238
00:19:35,883 --> 00:19:37,844
- Good morning.
- What about Jan?

239
00:19:37,964 --> 00:19:40,862
He sends you his brother,
because he's too cowardly to come.

240
00:19:40,982 --> 00:19:43,196
He probably needs money again.

241
00:19:43,489 --> 00:19:47,827
I dont want to hear or see anything
about that whole Kröger rabble anymore!

242
00:19:48,419 --> 00:19:51,232
- You seem to have a screw loose, eh!
- Forget it, it's useless.

243
00:19:51,352 --> 00:19:53,345
Now come on, really...

244
00:19:53,885 --> 00:19:55,508
What about Jan?

245
00:19:55,752 --> 00:19:57,498
My brother...

246
00:19:58,813 --> 00:20:01,689
well... he's dead.

247
00:20:02,441 --> 00:20:03,638
No...

248
00:20:04,918 --> 00:20:06,245
No!

249
00:20:06,983 --> 00:20:08,264
Yes.

250
00:20:09,426 --> 00:20:12,828
Two days ago...
blackwater fever.

251
00:20:21,815 --> 00:20:23,124
And a rascal...

252
00:20:23,244 --> 00:20:27,596
my brother sure wasn't a rascal,
don't you think that.

253
00:20:29,111 --> 00:20:32,035
After all everyone
can have bad luck in life.

254
00:20:32,155 --> 00:20:35,111
Well, and the money,
the money you gave him,

255
00:20:35,231 --> 00:20:37,929
he gave it to me
to return it to you.

256
00:20:38,049 --> 00:20:41,879
Because I promised my brother
that I will look after you.

257
00:20:42,105 --> 00:20:44,360
But I think
that won't be necessary now,

258
00:20:44,480 --> 00:20:47,647
as you have such a nice home here...

259
00:20:47,929 --> 00:20:50,098
"Home", Mr. Kröger -

260
00:20:50,955 --> 00:20:52,787
- If you knew...
- Yes?

261
00:20:52,907 --> 00:20:55,276
It's hell,
from morning to night...

262
00:20:55,546 --> 00:20:58,658
once one had tough luck
in a small town.

263
00:21:00,162 --> 00:21:03,611
But do you...
have a child from my brother?

264
00:21:03,731 --> 00:21:06,420
- No, it's not that.
- Ah, I already thought...

265
00:21:06,540 --> 00:21:08,111
Guess you've been lucky.

266
00:21:08,231 --> 00:21:11,569
But in any case, it would be fine
if you'd get out of here for a while!

267
00:21:11,689 --> 00:21:13,354
Where can I go?

268
00:21:13,474 --> 00:21:16,500
Where you can go?
I take you with me...

269
00:21:16,620 --> 00:21:18,356
to Hamburg!

270
00:21:18,907 --> 00:21:21,569
- To Hamburg?
- Yeah, I know a lot of people there,

271
00:21:21,689 --> 00:21:24,456
we'll soon find an employment for you.

272
00:21:24,856 --> 00:21:28,377
Yes, girl -
you can count on me!

273
00:21:28,954 --> 00:21:32,701
We Krögers, we sure ain't no rabble!

274
00:21:33,422 --> 00:21:37,819
Finally getting some peace...
finally no more accusations!

275
00:21:37,939 --> 00:21:40,255
That would be fine...

276
00:21:40,761 --> 00:21:43,894
But I can't, Mr. Kröger.
Can't do that to mother.

277
00:21:44,014 --> 00:21:47,041
She hasn't got it easy either,
since father's dead.

278
00:21:47,161 --> 00:21:49,965
Fine - you can still think it over!

279
00:21:50,085 --> 00:21:53,576
I'm going back later this evening -
if you want to find me sometime:

280
00:21:53,696 --> 00:21:57,192
<i>Hannes Kröger, Hamburg,
Great Freedom</i> will do.

281
00:21:59,423 --> 00:22:01,337
Well then, cheers...

282
00:22:02,575 --> 00:22:04,437
Thank you, Mr. Kröger!

283
00:22:04,557 --> 00:22:05,694
And...

284
00:22:11,600 --> 00:22:13,890
Poor Girl!

285
00:22:17,741 --> 00:22:21,370
Does the affair with that rascal
from Bremen never end?

286
00:22:21,490 --> 00:22:24,179
You shouldn't bad-mouth Jan, mother...

287
00:22:24,299 --> 00:22:26,527
He's dead and I once
was very fond of him.

288
00:22:26,647 --> 00:22:30,534
Oh, I probably should be thankful
that he got people gossiping over you.

289
00:22:30,766 --> 00:22:33,737
You should only hear
what people are saying.

290
00:22:33,857 --> 00:22:36,533
Only good thing is that your father
didn'd live to see this.

291
00:22:36,653 --> 00:22:40,141
Leave father out of this.
He'd understand me.

292
00:22:40,261 --> 00:22:43,476
Your father? He would have
chased you out of the house!

293
00:22:43,596 --> 00:22:46,083
Our daughter, a sailor sweetheart!

294
00:22:46,203 --> 00:22:49,993
- One has to be ashamed in front of
the people!   - You're ashamed of me?

295
00:22:50,113 --> 00:22:53,779
I see...
I didn't know that, mother...

296
00:22:54,721 --> 00:22:59,265
I didn't believe that strangers are
more important to you than your child.

297
00:23:03,577 --> 00:23:04,997
Gisa!

298
00:23:06,019 --> 00:23:07,416
Kid!

299
00:23:24,941 --> 00:23:26,550
Well, girl?

300
00:23:28,734 --> 00:23:31,655
Where's the journey going?

301
00:23:31,775 --> 00:23:34,651
- To Hamburg!
- Bravo.

302
00:23:38,897 --> 00:23:40,235
So...

303
00:23:41,034 --> 00:23:43,582
now come on in, girl.

304
00:23:44,931 --> 00:23:47,716
Guess I first show you my mansion.

305
00:23:47,836 --> 00:23:51,790
Now this, that's my parlor.

306
00:23:51,910 --> 00:23:55,338
Over there, that's my parents,
and beneath the banjo...

307
00:23:55,458 --> 00:23:58,005
there's a picture of captain Jürs
of the Padua.    - Ah!

308
00:23:58,125 --> 00:24:01,257
There's a parrot!
Does he talk?

309
00:24:01,377 --> 00:24:03,873
He better not!

310
00:24:03,993 --> 00:24:05,954
And here's my bunk...

311
00:24:06,074 --> 00:24:08,277
It already has seen many a storm!

312
00:24:08,397 --> 00:24:10,590
And over there's the caboose!

313
00:24:10,710 --> 00:24:14,371
- <i>Caboose</i>? Is that...
- No, girl, that's the kitchen.

314
00:24:14,491 --> 00:24:18,036
- What you mean, is half a floor
downstairs.    - I see!

315
00:24:31,823 --> 00:24:35,064
You're still standing there, kid -
make yourself comfortable!

316
00:24:35,651 --> 00:24:38,041
I just have to wash my hands.

317
00:24:40,926 --> 00:24:41,986
So...

318
00:24:44,120 --> 00:24:47,998
- Are you going away again, Mr. Kröger?
- Sure, I have to go to my joint!

319
00:24:48,118 --> 00:24:50,798
But tomorrow morning
I'll be back.

320
00:24:55,468 --> 00:24:57,170
So... well.

321
00:24:57,664 --> 00:24:59,531
Gisa, what's the matter with you?

322
00:24:59,651 --> 00:25:01,714
- Nothing.
- That's fine.

323
00:25:01,834 --> 00:25:05,039
I already thought, because
it's all a bit unfamiliar to you...

324
00:25:05,159 --> 00:25:07,857
but I think you will get
accustomed to me.    - Yes.

325
00:25:07,977 --> 00:25:11,285
I first have to get acustomed
to you, too... Gisa.

326
00:25:11,405 --> 00:25:13,610
But we'll have to find
another name for you.

327
00:25:13,730 --> 00:25:16,196
<i>Gisa</i>... no Hamburger
would know what that means.

328
00:25:16,316 --> 00:25:19,942
- <i>Gisa</i>... comes from <i>Gisela</i>.
- Yes... <i>Padua</i>!

329
00:25:20,062 --> 00:25:23,993
Too bad it's no name for a girl.
But it has to start with a 'P'.   - Why?

330
00:25:24,113 --> 00:25:26,872
Everything that starts with a 'P'
brings me good luck.

331
00:25:26,992 --> 00:25:29,150
<i>Padua</i>, <i>Pinnersberg</i>,

332
00:25:29,270 --> 00:25:32,802
St. <i>Pauli</i>, <i>Police</i>...
How about...

333
00:25:32,922 --> 00:25:35,796
<i>Paloma</i>.
<i>La Paloma.</i>

334
00:25:35,916 --> 00:25:37,402
<i>La Paloma</i>?

335
00:25:37,522 --> 00:25:40,381
If it sounds Greek to you:
it's Spanish!

336
00:25:40,501 --> 00:25:42,556
It means "the white dove".

337
00:25:42,676 --> 00:25:44,799
Oh, but I'm no white dove!

338
00:25:44,919 --> 00:25:47,127
But you're some
little birdie too, eh!

339
00:25:47,247 --> 00:25:50,205
And when a white dove has lost
its way and comes on board,

340
00:25:50,325 --> 00:25:53,071
the sailors know they will
soon be in the harbor.

341
00:25:53,191 --> 00:25:55,957
And such a small animal

342
00:25:56,077 --> 00:25:58,548
a sailor won't harm.

343
00:26:00,012 --> 00:26:02,678
Well then cheers... Paloma.

344
00:26:06,141 --> 00:26:08,510
Holy moly!

345
00:26:08,769 --> 00:26:10,471
We haven't got anything to eat!

346
00:26:10,591 --> 00:26:13,007
- Won't you get anything?
- Well I do, but you!

347
00:26:13,127 --> 00:26:16,471
- Oh, it doesn't matter...
- Now come here... Paloma.

348
00:26:16,591 --> 00:26:20,322
Here's five mark...
go downstairs our house...

349
00:26:20,624 --> 00:26:22,377
there's a pub - <i>Billbräu</i>...

350
00:26:22,497 --> 00:26:25,043
give my regards to Mrs. Börgel,
that's the innkeeper...

351
00:26:25,163 --> 00:26:27,203
tell her to give you
something yummy for eats.

352
00:26:27,323 --> 00:26:30,269
Couldn't I eat a bite in your bar?

353
00:26:30,389 --> 00:26:33,664
At the Hippodrom?
That's where the wicked pirates are!

354
00:26:33,784 --> 00:26:35,828
That's no place for small kids!

355
00:26:36,471 --> 00:26:44,029
<i>My first, he was a sailor
who was tattooed on his chest.</i>

356
00:26:44,149 --> 00:26:51,704
<i>He wore ocean blue trousers
and I was so terribly shy.</i>

357
00:26:51,824 --> 00:26:59,526
<i>He took my hand and he promised
to be faithful, and gave me his word</i>

358
00:26:59,646 --> 00:27:03,427
<i>to take no other for me...</i>

359
00:27:04,073 --> 00:27:09,498
<i>and next morning he went on board.</i>

360
00:27:11,011 --> 00:27:15,484
<i>The first time it still hurts</i>

361
00:27:15,978 --> 00:27:20,366
<i>you still think
you will never get over it.</i>

362
00:27:20,486 --> 00:27:24,340
<i>But by and by, and bit by bit</i>

363
00:27:24,761 --> 00:27:28,603
<i>you get used to it!</i>

364
00:27:30,998 --> 00:27:38,425
<i>For parting he gave me two florins
and he said to me so tenderly</i>

365
00:27:38,545 --> 00:27:46,562
<i>Love, you have to be a bit patient,
I come back to you in a year.</i>

366
00:27:46,682 --> 00:27:50,554
<i>He wrote me one more letter</i>

367
00:27:50,674 --> 00:27:54,596
<i>from Hong Kong, how fine it is there,</i>

368
00:27:54,716 --> 00:27:58,838
<i>and that he would still love me...</i>

369
00:27:59,484 --> 00:28:05,711
<i>and I never saw him again.</i>

370
00:28:06,786 --> 00:28:11,227
<i>The first time it still hurts</i>

371
00:28:11,347 --> 00:28:15,556
<i>you still think
you will never get over it.</i>

372
00:28:15,676 --> 00:28:19,539
<i>But by and by, and bit by bit</i>

373
00:28:20,114 --> 00:28:23,394
<i>you get used to it.</i>

374
00:28:27,773 --> 00:28:31,812
- Another round, Mr. Scholz?
- Think we can handle one more, Mrs. Börgel.

375
00:28:32,082 --> 00:28:34,388
WHO DARES WINS

376
00:28:34,666 --> 00:28:36,545
There's something wrong
with that box!

377
00:28:36,665 --> 00:28:39,516
You just haven't got
the knack of it!

378
00:28:47,532 --> 00:28:49,892
- What will it be, Miss?
- Mr. Kröger sends me...

379
00:28:50,012 --> 00:28:51,735
he'd like to have
a little bit to eat.

380
00:28:51,855 --> 00:28:55,316
I see... Mr. Kröger wants
something to eat again.

381
00:28:55,436 --> 00:28:59,433
So choose something... for Mr. Kröger.

382
00:29:00,173 --> 00:29:03,097
- Hey... dimwit...
- Sorry...

383
00:29:06,864 --> 00:29:10,478
Owww!
The box is fantastic! ...

384
00:29:10,598 --> 00:29:12,233
...in order.

385
00:29:12,500 --> 00:29:14,872
You brought me good luck, little miss.

386
00:29:14,992 --> 00:29:17,898
May I, out of thankfulness... oops...
invite you for a drink?

387
00:29:18,018 --> 00:29:21,458
- Thanks.   - Don't say "Thanks"
unless you enjoyed it!

388
00:29:21,578 --> 00:29:25,274
- But I didn't want any beer...
- But I. Cheers!

389
00:29:25,394 --> 00:29:28,691
Better take it along, Miss,
Mr. Kröger's used to it.

390
00:29:28,811 --> 00:29:32,249
- What do I owe you?
- Nevermind. I put it on Kröger's tab.

391
00:29:32,369 --> 00:29:33,822
Good Evening.

392
00:29:33,942 --> 00:29:35,395
Good Evening...!

393
00:29:39,919 --> 00:29:41,704
See you!

394
00:29:44,205 --> 00:29:46,565
She's nice... ain't she?

395
00:29:46,685 --> 00:29:48,519
She's a floosie!

396
00:29:48,639 --> 00:29:51,174
Who knows where Kröger
picked her up!

397
00:29:54,568 --> 00:29:56,746
Cashier!

398
00:29:58,390 --> 00:30:00,511
You cut quite a dash, eh!

399
00:30:00,631 --> 00:30:04,236
Want to ruin our little Anita's
whole nightclub?

400
00:30:04,356 --> 00:30:06,847
- Have you been true to me?
- As true as you've been to me!

401
00:30:06,967 --> 00:30:09,502
We'll have to talk about that later!
Well, and you two lunatics?

402
00:30:09,622 --> 00:30:11,856
- Is it still the great love?
- Guess it is, Hannes!

403
00:30:11,976 --> 00:30:14,490
Leave a little bit over
of that skinny herring!

404
00:30:15,167 --> 00:30:18,058
Don't listen to Hannes...
you're my one and only!

405
00:30:18,178 --> 00:30:21,818
Well then Anita -
a round of kümmel and beer!

406
00:30:26,760 --> 00:30:28,427
Is there someone?

407
00:30:29,672 --> 00:30:32,009
I already thought
I came here for nothing again.

408
00:30:32,129 --> 00:30:34,580
I brought the sea chest and the stuff.

409
00:30:34,700 --> 00:30:38,108
If you'd sign here...

410
00:30:40,119 --> 00:30:43,336
I put everything inside.
It's from the harbor hospital.

411
00:30:44,604 --> 00:30:46,096
Bye.

412
00:31:30,823 --> 00:31:32,818
- Today I'll go home with you.
- But Jens...

413
00:31:32,938 --> 00:31:35,895
I already told you, it's impossible.

414
00:31:36,670 --> 00:31:39,229
- Today I'll go home with you...
- No!

415
00:31:39,349 --> 00:31:41,671
Now hold still, will you!.

416
00:31:41,791 --> 00:31:43,972
Fine... all right...

417
00:31:44,092 --> 00:31:47,107
The issue is over,
over and done.

418
00:31:48,540 --> 00:31:50,489
I'm not dependent on you?!

419
00:31:50,609 --> 00:31:52,829
Man... you're juiced!

420
00:31:54,203 --> 00:31:56,398
Or do you perhaps think
I'm dependent on you?

421
00:31:56,518 --> 00:31:59,827
Jens - now be reasonable!

422
00:32:00,543 --> 00:32:02,922
One should have hair....

423
00:32:03,815 --> 00:32:05,799
Whether you think
that I'm dependent on you?

424
00:32:05,919 --> 00:32:08,946
If you don't keep quiet I'll go.

425
00:32:09,310 --> 00:32:11,349
Then I'll go with you.

426
00:32:13,530 --> 00:32:16,359
And he's... not dependent on her!

427
00:32:16,847 --> 00:32:19,800
- So send the girl to me tomorrow...
- That's fine.

428
00:32:19,920 --> 00:32:22,676
- ...and if she's busy and proper...
- Wellenkamp...

429
00:32:22,796 --> 00:32:25,156
I'd put my shirt on Lisa.

430
00:32:25,276 --> 00:32:26,987
Allow me to introduce - Kröger.

431
00:32:27,107 --> 00:32:30,691
<i>Rosamunde...</i>

432
00:32:34,333 --> 00:32:36,187
Riding is fun!

433
00:32:36,307 --> 00:32:39,440
Whether you think
that I'm dependent on you...

434
00:32:40,003 --> 00:32:42,328
I'm not dependent on you.

435
00:32:49,766 --> 00:32:51,640
I thought you'll stay?

436
00:32:51,760 --> 00:32:54,267
Oh, well.. eh...
I can't right now...

437
00:32:54,387 --> 00:32:57,817
- Still have an appointment later.
- Tonight? Who is it?

438
00:32:57,937 --> 00:33:02,164
Well, with... with the...
It's business.

439
00:33:02,284 --> 00:33:04,502
I know that kind of business.

440
00:33:04,622 --> 00:33:07,014
You know shit... babe!

441
00:33:07,134 --> 00:33:09,574
<i>Rosamunde...</i>

442
00:33:09,694 --> 00:33:13,924
<i>give me your heart,
be my dear...</i>

443
00:33:19,801 --> 00:33:23,668
- They don't give me no more kümmel!
- Go home, you've got enough!

444
00:33:23,788 --> 00:33:26,048
Enough...? Enough!?

445
00:33:26,168 --> 00:33:29,299
Do you think
I'm dependent on you?

446
00:33:29,921 --> 00:33:33,620
Closing time! The customer
is liable to prosecution as well!

447
00:34:48,398 --> 00:34:50,768
<i>Are you cold, eh?</i>

448
00:34:50,888 --> 00:34:52,865
Jacko, quiet!

449
00:35:52,722 --> 00:35:54,315
Good morning!

450
00:35:57,066 --> 00:35:59,297
- Can I have a few tabs?
- Work already over?

451
00:35:59,417 --> 00:36:02,076
"Already"...?
I'm back from the night shift!

452
00:36:02,196 --> 00:36:04,119
I'm dog-tired,
looking forward to my bed!

453
00:36:04,239 --> 00:36:06,984
- Morning...
- What's this?

454
00:36:07,104 --> 00:36:11,117
Mr. Kröger?
Up so early?

455
00:36:11,237 --> 00:36:13,323
I return the mug...

456
00:36:13,443 --> 00:36:17,743
and then I'd like to take
a little bit upstairs for breakfast.

457
00:36:20,453 --> 00:36:23,224
Think I'll risk one more, eh?

458
00:36:24,538 --> 00:36:26,241
Wiseguy...

459
00:36:28,554 --> 00:36:32,604
- ...and a bar of raspberry chocolate.
- I see...!

460
00:36:32,724 --> 00:36:35,898
Why "I see"?
It's not what <i>you</i> think.

461
00:36:36,018 --> 00:36:39,364
The lady who brought the beer
yesterday is in fact...

462
00:36:39,484 --> 00:36:42,264
a distant relative of mine,
is this information enough?

463
00:36:42,384 --> 00:36:44,165
Does she also work at the Hippodrom?

464
00:36:44,265 --> 00:36:46,538
No, she does not work at the Hippodrom,

465
00:36:46,658 --> 00:36:49,870
but if you really want to know,
she's working as a saleswoman

466
00:36:49,990 --> 00:36:52,700
for my friend Wellenkamp
in his store,

467
00:36:52,820 --> 00:36:54,484
that's all there is!

468
00:36:56,985 --> 00:36:58,723
Many thanks!

469
00:37:00,359 --> 00:37:01,428
Good afternoon!

470
00:37:01,548 --> 00:37:04,422
- I want a <i>buscherump</i>, Miss.
- Oh... yes.

471
00:37:04,542 --> 00:37:06,477
- Don't you understand me?
- No.

472
00:37:06,597 --> 00:37:08,731
Don't you have a <i>buscherump</i>?

473
00:37:08,851 --> 00:37:11,957
- A <i>what</i>, please?
- A <i>buscherump</i>, Miss!

474
00:37:12,077 --> 00:37:13,527
A <i>b...</i>

475
00:37:14,619 --> 00:37:17,331
Just a moment, yes?
Mr. Wellenkamp?

476
00:37:17,907 --> 00:37:20,655
- How can I help you, please?
- I don't want no <i>buscherump</i>.

477
00:37:20,775 --> 00:37:23,085
- I want a tie.
- A tie?   - Yes.

478
00:37:23,205 --> 00:37:25,898
Maybe you want to help
yourself? Mr. Wellenkamp!

479
00:37:26,018 --> 00:37:29,068
What will it be, sailor?
- Do you have a <i>buscherump</i>?

480
00:37:29,188 --> 00:37:31,357
- We have.
- That's fine.

481
00:37:36,441 --> 00:37:38,143
How about that one perhaps?

482
00:37:38,263 --> 00:37:40,350
Well... looks really cute!

483
00:37:42,452 --> 00:37:45,562
- Don't you recognize me?
- No.

484
00:37:45,823 --> 00:37:48,313
Or perhaps you take Pepita -
matches with everything.

485
00:37:48,433 --> 00:37:50,919
But I need one
who only matches me.

486
00:37:51,930 --> 00:37:55,265
Sorry, I'm afraid I can't help you
with that - that's all we have in ties.

487
00:37:55,385 --> 00:37:58,224
- Who's talking of ties?
- Me.

488
00:37:58,344 --> 00:38:02,498
Oh... well then...
let's see... all right?

489
00:38:08,585 --> 00:38:12,119
- And how do you like that one?
- Well... guess it's a matter of taste.

490
00:38:12,239 --> 00:38:14,538
What do you think... honestly?

491
00:38:19,261 --> 00:38:21,669
- Awful.
- That's right!

492
00:38:21,789 --> 00:38:23,290
I take it.

493
00:38:24,921 --> 00:38:27,199
3 mark 85?

494
00:38:27,539 --> 00:38:29,794
You're spending way too much
money for knick-knacks.

495
00:38:29,914 --> 00:38:32,894
You better should put
something away early enough.

496
00:38:33,014 --> 00:38:34,937
One has to put up with the loss.

497
00:38:35,057 --> 00:38:38,894
Don't make fun of an elderly woman
who means well for you.

498
00:38:39,612 --> 00:38:43,311
"Elderly woman"?
I didn't hear that, Mrs. Kaasbohm.

499
00:38:43,431 --> 00:38:46,669
With your figure? You're still crisp
and as fresh as a daisy.

500
00:38:46,789 --> 00:38:49,663
You've got no ethical earnestness
at all, Mr. Scholz.

501
00:38:49,783 --> 00:38:52,479
Earnestness I've got indeed,
Mrs. Kaasbohm, but no time.

502
00:38:52,599 --> 00:38:56,060
It's pretty...
but as you already have four ties?

503
00:38:56,180 --> 00:38:59,477
- I don't want to wear it.
- Why then did you buy it?

504
00:38:59,597 --> 00:39:03,911
- To exchange it.
- To exchange it?   - Yes!

505
00:39:04,203 --> 00:39:07,537
No.
No no no no.

506
00:39:07,657 --> 00:39:10,173
- That one doesn't fit either.
- For what suit do you want the tie?

507
00:39:10,293 --> 00:39:13,789
For my good Sunday afternoon promenading
suit of course.  - How does it look like?

508
00:39:13,909 --> 00:39:16,748
- Great! Head to toe!
- I mean, what color?

509
00:39:16,868 --> 00:39:19,609
Well, it hasn't got a real color...

510
00:39:19,729 --> 00:39:22,720
- it's more like... grey.
- What kind of grey?

511
00:39:22,840 --> 00:39:25,961
Some... greyish grey.

512
00:39:26,877 --> 00:39:29,076
- Light or dark?
- Me? Always light.

513
00:39:29,196 --> 00:39:31,998
- So, wine-red!
- No, not wine... beer!

514
00:39:32,118 --> 00:39:34,488
Very funny.
I meant the suit.

515
00:39:34,608 --> 00:39:37,567
Well, it isn't wine-red.
It's light grey.

516
00:39:37,687 --> 00:39:40,703
Yes I know...
But to a wine-red...

517
00:39:40,823 --> 00:39:43,124
To a light grey suit
fits only a wine-red tie.

518
00:39:43,244 --> 00:39:46,212
That's a matter of taste. That's
too dark. The suit ain't <i>that</i> light.

519
00:39:46,332 --> 00:39:47,562
4 mark 20...!

520
00:39:49,606 --> 00:39:52,724
- And that?
- That's too light!

521
00:39:53,078 --> 00:39:55,974
Then I have an excellent
suggestion for you:

522
00:39:56,094 --> 00:40:00,013
- You best come by with the suit
yourself.    - No, that won't work!

523
00:40:00,471 --> 00:40:03,712
I'm wearing the suit only on Sunday,
and on Sunday you're closed!

524
00:40:03,832 --> 00:40:06,218
But now let <i>me</i> make a suggestion:

525
00:40:06,338 --> 00:40:09,095
- On Sunday you come to me!
- What?!

526
00:40:09,215 --> 00:40:11,995
Well, I meant we could
meet on Sunday sometime!

527
00:40:12,115 --> 00:40:14,349
Together we could go
to Sagebiel's, out at Blankenese,

528
00:40:14,469 --> 00:40:17,824
and then I could show you
my new suit in motion, eh?

529
00:40:17,944 --> 00:40:20,772
- How about it?   - I think
you should better go home now.

530
00:40:20,892 --> 00:40:24,290
- But I've still got so much time!
- But I don't.

531
00:40:27,383 --> 00:40:31,362
So, as agreed, next Sunday afternoon
I'll be waiting before your house.

532
00:40:42,579 --> 00:40:46,384
That's typical Hamburg crap weather...
and it won't get any better today.

533
00:40:46,504 --> 00:40:48,228
It doesn't matter, Hannes.

534
00:40:48,348 --> 00:40:51,856
Today of all days, when I wanted
to show you the harbor...

535
00:40:52,198 --> 00:40:54,819
What happened to the curtains, eh?

536
00:40:55,206 --> 00:40:58,518
- Are they new?
- Yes, they're new.

537
00:40:58,638 --> 00:41:00,279
Well I...

538
00:41:01,136 --> 00:41:04,265
And the tablecloth...
haven't seen it before either!

539
00:41:04,385 --> 00:41:07,330
- That's new, too!
- Say, did <i>you</i> buy all this?

540
00:41:07,450 --> 00:41:09,737
Yes - do you like it?

541
00:41:09,857 --> 00:41:13,412
- Paloma, where did you get the money?
- I had saved a bit...

542
00:41:13,532 --> 00:41:15,630
You must be a bit batty, girl!

543
00:41:15,750 --> 00:41:19,191
Spending your little dough for me?
No way!

544
00:41:19,311 --> 00:41:21,386
But you bought the bed for me.

545
00:41:21,506 --> 00:41:24,745
But that's a different matter!
You couldn't sleep on the sofa

546
00:41:24,865 --> 00:41:28,505
huddled like a little doggie forever!

547
00:41:28,742 --> 00:41:31,829
- And the bed was dirt cheap.
- The cloth was really cheap, too.

548
00:41:31,949 --> 00:41:34,694
- And I sewed it myself.
- Downstairs at Mrs. Börgel's?

549
00:41:34,814 --> 00:41:36,559
No, at the Wellenkamps,
at the store.

550
00:41:36,679 --> 00:41:39,130
Mrs. Wellenkamp lent me her
sewing machine, as we don't have one.

551
00:41:39,250 --> 00:41:42,911
You get along quite well with Carl
and his wife, eh?   - Oh yes.

552
00:41:43,031 --> 00:41:46,328
And how about the customers?
How do you get on with the guys?

553
00:41:46,448 --> 00:41:50,460
Well, they're a bit fresh at times...

554
00:41:50,580 --> 00:41:52,656
but I can deal with them.

555
00:42:01,783 --> 00:42:04,025
Do your parents also live here?

556
00:42:04,145 --> 00:42:06,802
They're long dead....
Father remained on sea,

557
00:42:06,922 --> 00:42:08,965
and then mother also
didn't live much longer.

558
00:42:09,085 --> 00:42:13,704
- Were you more children at home?
- No. Except me only little Jan.

559
00:42:16,973 --> 00:42:19,485
You Krögers were all seamen, right?

560
00:42:19,605 --> 00:42:22,820
Tcha... guess it has to be...

561
00:42:22,940 --> 00:42:25,829
So you're actually the only one
who didn't go to sea?

562
00:42:25,949 --> 00:42:29,224
What the...
Now there's a thing!

563
00:42:29,344 --> 00:42:33,522
- What gave you that idea?
- Well I thought you're a musician?

564
00:42:33,642 --> 00:42:37,557
- Musician?    - Well, or
an entertainer or something...

565
00:42:37,677 --> 00:42:40,257
I'm a sailor, dammit!
- Yes I know...   - I'm...

566
00:42:40,377 --> 00:42:42,911
...you perform in a sailor costume,
but I thought...

567
00:42:43,031 --> 00:42:45,644
A sailor's what I am, goddammit,
I'm a sailor,

568
00:42:45,764 --> 00:42:48,729
all my rags are still here, over there!
And if I wanted to sign up

569
00:42:48,849 --> 00:42:51,260
I could sign up tomorrow,
but... I don't want to!

570
00:42:51,380 --> 00:42:54,365
But I couldn't have
guessed that, Hannes!

571
00:42:55,421 --> 00:42:58,245
"Entertainer"... that's
a fine taradiddle...

572
00:42:58,365 --> 00:43:01,059
For 18 years I've been to sea -
I can prove it anytime!

573
00:43:01,179 --> 00:43:04,265
Where do you think I got that jacket,
at the fish market?

574
00:43:04,385 --> 00:43:07,902
Here... here's all my papers!

575
00:43:08,022 --> 00:43:11,957
It's all in it, where I've been...
Seamen's muster book.

576
00:43:12,077 --> 00:43:16,515
Here, Hannes Kröger.
First voyage as deckhand, as ship's boy.

577
00:43:16,635 --> 00:43:20,634
Bark Elisabeth from Hamburg
to Valparaiso, and back to Glasgow.

578
00:43:20,754 --> 00:43:24,376
And here, ordinary seaman.
Full-rigged ship Borkholm, a Norwegian.

579
00:43:24,496 --> 00:43:27,227
From Rotterdamn to Seaguard
and back to Bordeaux.

580
00:43:27,347 --> 00:43:29,575
And here from Bremen to... Frisco.

581
00:43:29,695 --> 00:43:32,301
And now all the trips as
able-bodied seaman on the Padua.

582
00:43:32,421 --> 00:43:35,964
From Hamburg to Port Victorioa und back
and so on and so on and so on...

583
00:43:36,084 --> 00:43:38,888
And all without any complaints -
take away that crap!

584
00:43:39,008 --> 00:43:42,546
And here's still all my stuff,
all the things I've...

585
00:43:42,666 --> 00:43:46,162
Well, here... last voyage...

586
00:43:46,282 --> 00:43:48,979
my sailing gear... here...

587
00:43:49,201 --> 00:43:52,043
my boots... a knife...

588
00:43:52,163 --> 00:43:55,072
- What's that, it's full of moths!
- Too bad about the fine buscherump...

589
00:43:55,192 --> 00:43:57,501
- That's a <i>buscherump</i>?
- And what's that... oh...

590
00:43:57,621 --> 00:44:00,033
- What's that?   - Huh?
- What is it?  - Oh, that's, uh...

591
00:44:00,153 --> 00:44:03,062
- Let me see!   - That's just...
that's a few... that's...

592
00:44:03,182 --> 00:44:06,573
cartographic... postcards...
specialties.

593
00:44:08,500 --> 00:44:10,097
Ohh...

594
00:44:11,234 --> 00:44:13,426
It's beautiful!

595
00:44:14,064 --> 00:44:18,197
- For what bride did you bring it along?
- Oh... no particular...

596
00:44:18,620 --> 00:44:22,606
- Would you like to have it?
- But I really cannot accept this!

597
00:44:28,195 --> 00:44:30,258
Are these real corals?

598
00:44:30,378 --> 00:44:34,182
Sure!
Straight from the South Seas!

599
00:44:37,071 --> 00:44:41,877
<i>No, I can't forget you, girl...</i>

600
00:44:41,997 --> 00:44:46,642
<i>brown girl from Samoa land!</i>

601
00:44:46,762 --> 00:44:51,729
<i>No, I can't forget you, girl...</i>

602
00:44:51,849 --> 00:44:57,285
<i>brown girl from Samoa land...</i>

603
00:45:01,215 --> 00:45:05,371
Has already seen a good part
of the world, the old accordion...

604
00:45:06,428 --> 00:45:10,115
- Is that difficult?
- No... not if you can.

605
00:45:11,608 --> 00:45:15,259
Wanna try?
Come here... So...

606
00:45:15,600 --> 00:45:18,911
In here, and here,
leave the fingers and thumbs outside.

607
00:45:19,031 --> 00:45:20,590
Now just play...

608
00:45:22,175 --> 00:45:24,342
Bravo bravo!
What's the name of the song?

609
00:45:24,462 --> 00:45:27,148
- Show me again correctly, Hannes...
- Come here...

610
00:45:31,516 --> 00:45:34,981
So, let go... so, out,
here, and over there...

611
00:45:46,468 --> 00:45:48,683
You dance quite well, girl!

612
00:45:54,836 --> 00:46:00,320
<i>My longing carries me away
into the blue distance...</i>

613
00:46:00,954 --> 00:46:04,687
Why actually didn't you
stay on sea, Hannes?

614
00:46:08,500 --> 00:46:11,200
You don't understand that, girl.

615
00:46:17,508 --> 00:46:19,433
I'm sorry, Hannes.

616
00:46:19,553 --> 00:46:21,749
I didn't want to hurt you.

617
00:46:21,869 --> 00:46:24,071
Please play something cheerful...!

618
00:46:24,191 --> 00:46:28,019
- No I can't - have to go to my joint!
- But you've got another hour!

619
00:46:28,139 --> 00:46:31,049
Not today, today I
have to be there earlier.

620
00:46:31,471 --> 00:46:35,008
- What are you doing tonight?
- I still have to darn a lot...

621
00:46:35,128 --> 00:46:36,252
Yeah...?

622
00:46:37,074 --> 00:46:40,268
Say... do you sometimes
listen to the radio?

623
00:46:40,388 --> 00:46:43,527
- Yes, on and off...
- Well then do so today too.

624
00:46:43,816 --> 00:46:46,928
Why? Anything special today?

625
00:46:47,362 --> 00:46:49,100
Not really...

626
00:46:49,220 --> 00:46:53,757
It's just... tonight I will
perform something on the radio.

627
00:46:54,325 --> 00:46:58,683
In our program "On the Reeperbahn at
half past midnight, a tour of St. Pauli"

628
00:46:58,803 --> 00:47:02,819
we've now arrived at the
Hippodrom at the Great Freedom,

629
00:47:02,939 --> 00:47:05,484
the venue known to all seafaring
people around the world,

630
00:47:05,604 --> 00:47:09,723
where the sailor finds relaxation
after a long journey and hard work.

631
00:47:09,843 --> 00:47:13,601
Now Hannes Kröger, the singing sailor,
enters the podium above the arena.

632
00:47:13,721 --> 00:47:17,352
The noise fades,
and now it resounds,

633
00:47:17,472 --> 00:47:21,013
the old tune, well-known
on all seas, <i>La Paloma</i>.

634
00:47:23,981 --> 00:47:31,461
<i>A wind from the south
draws me out to the sea!</i>

635
00:47:31,581 --> 00:47:38,209
<i>My love, don't be sad
even though parting hurts.</i>

636
00:47:38,479 --> 00:47:45,151
<i>My heart goes aboard
and onward the journey goes.</i>

637
00:47:45,271 --> 00:47:52,173
<i>Your pain will go by
and the reunion will be fine!</i>

638
00:47:52,293 --> 00:47:57,409
<i>My longing carries me away
into the blue distance.</i>

639
00:47:57,529 --> 00:48:02,602
<i>Below me the sea
and above me night and stars.</i>

640
00:48:02,722 --> 00:48:07,745
<i>Ahead of me the world,
carried by the wind of life,</i>

641
00:48:07,865 --> 00:48:12,268
<i>don't cry my dear,
those tears, they're all in vain.</i>

642
00:48:12,388 --> 00:48:18,498
<i>La Paloma ohe -
once it has to be over!</i>

643
00:48:18,618 --> 00:48:26,025
<i>Only memories of hours of love
will still remain on shore.</i>

644
00:48:26,145 --> 00:48:32,095
<i>My bride is the sea,
only to her I can be faithful.</i>

645
00:48:32,215 --> 00:48:34,414
<i>When the storm wind sings its song
I'm called by...</i>

646
00:48:34,534 --> 00:48:38,005
At that weather you had
to wear the good gray suit?

647
00:48:38,125 --> 00:48:40,884
<i>Great Freedom's happiness!</i>

648
00:48:41,004 --> 00:48:47,983
<i>How blue is the sea,
how big can be the skies!</i>

649
00:48:48,103 --> 00:48:53,839
<i>High up from the crow's nest
I look far into the world. </i>

650
00:48:53,959 --> 00:48:56,084
If I only knew what's
the matter with Hannes!

651
00:48:56,204 --> 00:48:58,923
Yes... he sings so different today!
<i>Forward I set my view,</i>

652
00:48:59,043 --> 00:49:02,178
So... entirely different!
<i>for no sailor must look back.</i>

653
00:49:02,298 --> 00:49:08,182
<i>Cape Horn is at lee side,
we now have to put trust in God.</i>

654
00:49:08,302 --> 00:49:09,558
Something's wrong!

655
00:49:09,678 --> 00:49:11,880
<i>Sailor, take care,
for even, as if a greeting of peace...</i>

656
00:49:11,979 --> 00:49:13,717
Yes, that's your own fault...

657
00:49:13,837 --> 00:49:15,664
You just put up
with far too much from him!

658
00:49:15,784 --> 00:49:19,069
Look at how I deal with Jens...
he does what I want, not vice versa.

659
00:49:19,189 --> 00:49:21,949
For you that's
something quite different ...

660
00:49:22,069 --> 00:49:24,442
you do not love Jens!

661
00:49:25,286 --> 00:49:29,737
<i>Sooner or later
the bell tolls for each of us.</i>

662
00:49:29,857 --> 00:49:33,261
<i>La Paloma ohe -</i>

663
00:49:33,381 --> 00:49:37,045
<i>once it all will be over!</i>

664
00:49:37,165 --> 00:49:41,298
<i>Once the sea will take us,</i>

665
00:49:41,418 --> 00:49:46,852
<i>and the sea returns none uf us.</i>

666
00:49:46,972 --> 00:49:53,733
<i>Sailor's bride is the sea,
only to her he can be faithful</i>

667
00:49:53,853 --> 00:49:58,709
<i>When the storm wind sings its song
I'm called by...</i>

668
00:49:58,829 --> 00:50:04,054
<i>Great Freedom's happiness!</i>

669
00:50:04,174 --> 00:50:07,720
<i>Come on sailors, ohe!</i>

670
00:50:07,840 --> 00:50:12,940
<i>La Paloma, farewell!</i>

671
00:50:26,107 --> 00:50:29,756
- What are you looking for, Hannes?
- Where did you hide away the Padua?

672
00:50:29,876 --> 00:50:34,347
- The Padua?   - Yes, my gift from Jens
and Fiete... the ship in a bottle!

673
00:50:37,282 --> 00:50:41,384
There it is...
Why do you hide it, Anita?

674
00:50:42,136 --> 00:50:46,668
If I don't want to stay here,
then I won't stay here anyway.

675
00:50:49,386 --> 00:50:51,649
What's the matter
with you anyway, Hannes?

676
00:50:51,769 --> 00:50:53,709
For days you're so... different.

677
00:50:53,829 --> 00:50:57,225
In the long run this makes me crazy,
every day the same racket in this dive,

678
00:50:57,345 --> 00:50:58,859
always acting the fool...

679
00:50:58,979 --> 00:51:01,619
Hannes Kröger, the singing sailor,
yeah, shit...

680
00:51:01,739 --> 00:51:04,347
what actually am I here,

681
00:51:04,467 --> 00:51:07,245
I'm a better entertainer clown,
that's what I am!

682
00:51:07,365 --> 00:51:09,773
Hannes, what makes you think
like that all of a sudden?

683
00:51:09,893 --> 00:51:12,019
You always wanted
to be your own master!

684
00:51:12,139 --> 00:51:14,859
- own... own master!
- But that's what you are!  - Ah, yeah?

685
00:51:14,979 --> 00:51:18,073
You no longer have to slave
on sea in all weathers for others

686
00:51:18,193 --> 00:51:22,150
You have everything you need,
your food, to drink, you have money...

687
00:51:22,478 --> 00:51:24,780
...you've got me...

688
00:51:24,900 --> 00:51:27,433
There's still other things.

689
00:51:27,868 --> 00:51:29,630
I see...

690
00:51:30,968 --> 00:51:34,326
...that other
is probably <i>an</i> other!

691
00:51:34,446 --> 00:51:35,665
Ah...

692
00:51:47,056 --> 00:51:51,099
I tell you, once you drift rudderless
you will soon be stranded.

693
00:51:51,219 --> 00:51:55,082
And no emergency tug
will get you back on course.

694
00:51:55,666 --> 00:51:59,085
But what's that gloomy brooding,
for a guy as you!

695
00:51:59,205 --> 00:52:03,452
The Great Freedom has worn me out,
finished, I'm a wreck!

696
00:52:03,572 --> 00:52:08,115
You're crazy! Talking like that
may be excusable for someone like me,

697
00:52:08,215 --> 00:52:12,352
for whom the Great Pilot
can come on board every day now...

698
00:52:12,472 --> 00:52:16,159
but you, you still can sail clear!

699
00:52:16,279 --> 00:52:19,056
"Sail clear"...
that's quite easy to say...

700
00:52:19,176 --> 00:52:22,990
I've become a stinkin' landlubber,
I'm already tied up ashore far too close!

701
00:52:23,110 --> 00:52:26,407
Then cut the cables, kid,
before it is too late!

702
00:52:26,527 --> 00:52:29,688
Or you will end up like me...

703
00:52:33,152 --> 00:52:36,146
Back to sea... just now...

704
00:52:36,651 --> 00:52:38,970
when I'm for the first time...

705
00:52:43,002 --> 00:52:44,420
Yeah - I am!

706
00:52:44,540 --> 00:52:47,219
But then you don't have
to go back to sea!

707
00:52:47,339 --> 00:52:51,057
Buy yourselves a barge
and do harbor tours!

708
00:52:51,386 --> 00:52:53,699
- A barge?
- Yes!

709
00:52:54,932 --> 00:52:56,647
A barge...

710
00:52:57,686 --> 00:52:59,751
He's what?
He is sick ?

711
00:52:59,871 --> 00:53:01,889
Yes, he's sick.

712
00:53:02,619 --> 00:53:05,543
- The ass is sick?
- Now that's a fine joint...

713
00:53:05,663 --> 00:53:08,225
The guests get beaten up,
the entertainer disappears,

714
00:53:08,345 --> 00:53:10,844
and the main attraction is sick.

715
00:53:10,964 --> 00:53:13,004
When I think of Cologne...

716
00:53:13,124 --> 00:53:14,131


717
00:53:25,994 --> 00:53:27,608
Hi Werner!

718
00:53:27,960 --> 00:53:31,328
Willem, what about it?
Come along to Vierlanden on Sunday?

719
00:53:31,448 --> 00:53:34,184
Sunday? No!

720
00:53:34,304 --> 00:53:37,132
For Sunday I have better plans!

721
00:53:58,492 --> 00:54:03,406
Mrs. Börgel told me to come down to
the barge stand to my friend Puhlmann.

722
00:54:16,076 --> 00:54:18,342
Even the weather plays along today!

723
00:54:18,462 --> 00:54:21,321
- Where are we going?    - I'll show
you the best place on the Elbe river.

724
00:54:21,441 --> 00:54:24,433
We'll travel down to Blankenese
with the green steamer.

725
00:54:24,809 --> 00:54:27,486
<i>For me and my girl
is the best in the world</i>

726
00:54:27,606 --> 00:54:29,679
<i>when we're going up the Elbe
on a green steamboat...</i>

727
00:54:29,799 --> 00:54:34,000
- Maybe we could go to Sagebiel, go
dancing?   - How do you know Sagebiel?

728
00:54:34,120 --> 00:54:36,971
Lately some cheeky guy in the store
said he wanted to take me there.

729
00:54:37,091 --> 00:54:39,345
Good that I wasn't around!

730
00:54:42,217 --> 00:54:45,258
Puhlmann!
Where's the fire?

731
00:54:45,378 --> 00:54:47,876
Can't you help me out
of the dilemma for a moment?

732
00:54:47,996 --> 00:54:52,326
Konrad let me down and now I don't
have a barge guide for the Germania.

733
00:54:52,446 --> 00:54:55,020
Couldn't you do at least one tour?

734
00:54:55,140 --> 00:54:58,616
On this occasion I could show you
the harbor - what do you think?

735
00:54:58,736 --> 00:55:01,695
That's fine by me, Hannes -
Sagebiel won't run away!

736
00:55:01,815 --> 00:55:03,604
I'm coming!

737
00:55:03,886 --> 00:55:05,394
Me too!

738
00:55:07,261 --> 00:55:09,621
Ahead of us is the <i>Kaiserspeicher</i>...

739
00:55:10,324 --> 00:55:13,695
The clock you see up there
is no clock...

740
00:55:13,942 --> 00:55:16,514
that's a water-level indicator...

741
00:55:16,634 --> 00:55:20,309
and the fat round ball you see on top
of the tower, now that's the clock!

742
00:55:20,429 --> 00:55:24,609
That's the <i>time ball</i>, or as
we say in Hamburg, the <i>shit ball</i>.

743
00:55:24,729 --> 00:55:26,757
That's the clock of the sailor.

744
00:55:26,877 --> 00:55:28,907
You can't carry it around
in your pocket.

745
00:55:29,027 --> 00:55:31,302
Now ain't this something...

746
00:55:33,053 --> 00:55:37,360
Over there, ladies, is the biggest
powder factory in all of Germany.

747
00:55:37,480 --> 00:55:40,078
So we better not get too close, eh?

748
00:55:40,198 --> 00:55:43,870
That's Dr. Oetker's
baking powder factory!

749
00:55:44,241 --> 00:55:47,146
Damned critters...
yeah... peep peep!

750
00:55:47,537 --> 00:55:51,177
Yes ladies and gentlemen,
these are the perils of seafaring!

751
00:55:51,297 --> 00:55:53,219
It can't be helped...

752
00:55:53,819 --> 00:55:57,565
So how do you like my new suit?

753
00:55:58,600 --> 00:56:02,179
So entirely without a tie it doesn't
look like much of course but...

753
00:56:02,299 --> 00:56:04,686
The steamer in front over there 
is just unloading.

754
00:56:04,806 --> 00:56:07,208
- Is it on fire?
- Of course not, Miss...

755
00:56:07,328 --> 00:56:10,396
if it were on fire 
it couldn't unload!

756
00:56:10,831 --> 00:56:13,473
It unloads Jamaica rum...
With me it's quite the opposite:

757
00:56:13,593 --> 00:56:16,995
I've got a terrible thirst 
and nothing to quench it!

759
00:56:17,958 --> 00:56:20,288
- Did you say something?
- No.

760
00:56:20,408 --> 00:56:21,904
You said "No"!

761
00:56:22,024 --> 00:56:24,959
Terrific! I already
thought you lost your voice!

762
00:56:25,079 --> 00:56:28,059
- Can you also say "Yes"?
- You're pretty cheeky!

763
00:56:28,179 --> 00:56:30,272
Oh I know...
my acquaintances always say

764
00:56:30,392 --> 00:56:33,630
that I'm as cheeky as
the seagulls at Lombard Bridge.

765
00:56:34,692 --> 00:56:37,423
And now our enchanted glance goes to...

766
00:56:38,567 --> 00:56:40,371
...the limit!

767
00:56:40,491 --> 00:56:41,724
That beats everything!

768
00:56:41,844 --> 00:56:44,410
I mean, this is the highlight
of our harbor tour...

769
00:56:44,530 --> 00:56:47,560
What you will see now
is the sailing ship harbour.

770
00:56:47,680 --> 00:56:49,989
Here a spectacular sight meets our eyes.

771
00:56:50,109 --> 00:56:53,620
This is the last sailing ship
based in Hamburg,

772
00:56:53,740 --> 00:56:58,033
the four masted barque Padua
of the shipping company F. Laeisz.

773
00:56:58,153 --> 00:57:01,251
On this proud ship I myself
did travel for many a year,

774
00:57:01,371 --> 00:57:04,022
no, for many decades as a sailor!

775
00:57:04,142 --> 00:57:07,837
- He's lying!
- Barmbeck landlubber, bugger off!

776
00:57:08,143 --> 00:57:11,283
The last trip from Australia
to Hamburg, the Padua went

777
00:57:11,403 --> 00:57:15,109
in the record time of 68... days ...

778
00:57:15,229 --> 00:57:18,443
Will you next Sunday again have an
appointment with your distant relative?

779
00:57:18,563 --> 00:57:20,316
Probably!

780
00:57:20,657 --> 00:57:24,891
In any case, next Sunday afternoon at 3
I'll be waiting at your door again.

781
00:57:25,130 --> 00:57:27,209
Without tie?

782
00:57:27,902 --> 00:57:30,628
Perhaps the gentlemen back there
would also deign to listen?

783
00:57:30,748 --> 00:57:33,880
I don't want to blather
my yap to frinches here for nothing!

784
00:57:34,000 --> 00:57:36,087
Hey hey hey hey hey...!

785
00:57:36,207 --> 00:57:40,678
Over there at Pinnersberg is the
most important building of Hamburg...

786
00:57:40,798 --> 00:57:43,148
that's where I live.

787
00:57:43,819 --> 00:57:45,966
Over there's the wharf of Blohm & Voss!

788
00:57:46,086 --> 00:57:48,325
The biggest German ships are built there.

789
00:57:48,445 --> 00:57:52,803
Every real Hamburger knows
the song of the workers of Blohm & Voss:

790
00:57:53,032 --> 00:57:56,816
<i>We're Hamburg kettle beaters</i>

791
00:57:56,936 --> 00:58:00,574
<i>we're working over there
at Blohm 'n Voss</i>

792
00:58:00,694 --> 00:58:04,214
<i>merry as larks
and always proper</i>

793
00:58:04,334 --> 00:58:07,866
<i>we chew tobacco
and have dreadful thirst.</i>

794
00:58:07,986 --> 00:58:11,716
<i>On Sunday dressed up
in our glad rags</i>

795
00:58:11,836 --> 00:58:15,344
<i>with a true girl by our side</i>

796
00:58:15,464 --> 00:58:19,149
<i>as perfect gentleman in every hall</i>

797
00:58:19,269 --> 00:58:22,286
<i>you always find a swarm of us!</i>

798
00:58:23,428 --> 00:58:24,426
<i>A jacket and a...</i>

799
00:58:24,546 --> 00:58:27,452
Hold your horses,
we're no choral society, eh!

800
00:58:30,159 --> 00:58:32,214
Now wait, pal...

801
00:58:36,461 --> 00:58:40,028
Would you please change from
starboard to portside for a moment?

802
00:58:40,148 --> 00:58:42,473
I'll do a little turn now and then...

803
00:58:42,593 --> 00:58:45,479
then you can have another look
at the marvelous harbor panorama!

804
00:58:45,599 --> 00:58:49,189
- How do you know the song so well?
- I'm working at Blohn & Voss!

805
00:58:49,309 --> 00:58:53,156
- What - you're not a sailor?
- Me? No!

806
00:58:53,276 --> 00:58:54,966
That's not for me.

807
00:58:55,086 --> 00:58:57,728
Gisa! Come over here, eh!

808
00:59:08,083 --> 00:59:11,524
Next Sunday you're <i>not</i> going
to wear the good grey suit again!

809
00:59:11,644 --> 00:59:15,175
Even more so! Next Sunday
I'll go dancing, at Sagebiel's!

810
00:59:15,295 --> 00:59:18,019
- Do you have a new bride?
- Not yet, Mrs. Kaasbohm,

811
00:59:18,139 --> 00:59:20,544
not yet! But next Sunday!

812
00:59:20,664 --> 00:59:24,242
Next Sunday for sure,
but this Sunday it's impossible!

813
00:59:24,362 --> 00:59:27,253
I was so looking forward to Sagebiel -
I wasn't out dancing for so long.

814
00:59:27,373 --> 00:59:29,367
Sagebiel won't run away.

815
00:59:29,487 --> 00:59:32,463
I have a meeting today,
that's very important for me,

816
00:59:32,583 --> 00:59:36,453
and perhaps not only for me...
for litte Paloma...

817
00:59:36,699 --> 00:59:38,202
Cheers!

818
01:00:09,854 --> 01:00:13,570
What's the matter? It's our last Sunday
and you ask us to come to Puhlmann?

819
01:00:13,690 --> 01:00:15,284
I rather wanted to see what Margot's doing

820
01:00:15,404 --> 01:00:17,853
and if she has no other plans have a
little farewell celebration with her!

821
01:00:17,973 --> 01:00:21,072
I'm doing a test drive and I want you
to take a look at the barge - let's go!

822
01:00:21,192 --> 01:00:24,896
- Hey, where are you?
- You want to <i>buy</i> the barge?

823
01:00:25,016 --> 01:00:26,578
Perhaps...!

824
01:00:26,887 --> 01:00:30,750
I don't believe it!
He's going to stay ashore?!

825
01:02:08,037 --> 01:02:11,322
- You really dance terrific!
- Always depends on the man, how he leads!

826
01:02:11,442 --> 01:02:14,166
- I think we go together just great.
- You think so?

827
01:02:14,286 --> 01:02:18,448
Yes. When I have you in my arm
your height is according to regulations.

828
01:02:18,568 --> 01:02:21,186
- Is that necessary?
- Yes, that's necessary.

829
01:02:21,639 --> 01:02:23,471
What's that?
What...

830
01:02:23,591 --> 01:02:25,703
Shall we make it cackle?

831
01:02:25,823 --> 01:02:27,992
Looks like you can't
go past any slot machine...

832
01:02:28,112 --> 01:02:31,209
- It's a pity about the money.
- Yes, Mrs. Kaasbohm says that too.

833
01:02:31,329 --> 01:02:32,548
Now come...

834
01:02:35,629 --> 01:02:37,496
- May I?
- Thank you!

835
01:02:37,616 --> 01:02:40,983
- Who is Mrs. Kaasbohm?
- Mrs. Kaasbohm, that's my landlady.

836
01:02:41,103 --> 01:02:42,885
Don't you want to get to know her?

837
01:02:43,872 --> 01:02:45,410
No?

838
01:02:51,008 --> 01:02:54,986
- He still hasn't brought the ice?
- It's always mighty busy here on Sunday.

839
01:02:55,845 --> 01:02:57,803
I guess you're here every Sunday?

840
01:02:57,923 --> 01:03:00,029
No. Just once in a while.

841
01:03:01,105 --> 01:03:04,369
- Why don't we drink a glass together?
- Better not. I get tipsy too easily.

842
01:03:04,489 --> 01:03:07,619
Don't worry... I'll take you <i>(Du)</i> home.

843
01:03:07,739 --> 01:03:09,759
- "You <i>(Du)</i>"?
- Right...

844
01:03:09,879 --> 01:03:11,936
I knew it all the time,
we forgot something...

845
01:03:12,056 --> 01:03:14,343
We have to catch up on this right away -
to drink to close friendship.

846
01:03:14,463 --> 01:03:17,782
You <i>(Sie)</i> better stick with "Mrs. Gisa",
and I with Mr...

847
01:03:17,902 --> 01:03:20,800
What's your <i>(Du)</i>...
What's your <i>(Sie)</i> name, anyway?

848
01:03:21,070 --> 01:03:22,467
See?... that's what happens!

849
01:03:22,587 --> 01:03:25,718
So what's it to be?
<i>Du</i> or <i>Sie</i>?

850
01:03:26,263 --> 01:03:28,804
You <i>(Sie)</i> can do as you <i>(Du)</i> please.

851
01:03:28,924 --> 01:03:32,211
Now... my name's Georg Wilhelm Scholz.

852
01:03:32,331 --> 01:03:35,626
And I'm Gisela Marie Sophie Häuptlein.

853
01:03:41,661 --> 01:03:43,415
Is that necessary?

854
01:03:43,535 --> 01:03:46,165
But that's the main point!

855
01:03:46,646 --> 01:03:50,171
Think about it calmly
and let me know.

856
01:03:50,291 --> 01:03:52,730
About the price we will
surely come to an agreement.

857
01:03:52,850 --> 01:03:54,718
All right, Fritz!

858
01:04:07,272 --> 01:04:09,985
Hello... well, guys?

859
01:04:16,243 --> 01:04:19,241
Day after tomorrow
the Padua goes to sea again.

860
01:04:19,361 --> 01:04:21,698
Have you signed on already?

861
01:04:21,983 --> 01:04:26,455
- Tcha, it has to go on...
- Well... now that the ass is sick...

862
01:04:26,873 --> 01:04:29,461
- Poor Margot.
- When will you kick off?

863
01:04:29,581 --> 01:04:31,624
At 7.

864
01:04:34,559 --> 01:04:36,238
Say, Hannes...

865
01:04:36,358 --> 01:04:38,150
There's something the matter with you.

866
01:04:38,270 --> 01:04:40,619
It sticks out a mile!

867
01:04:40,739 --> 01:04:43,825
- What's the girl's name?
- What girl?

868
01:04:43,945 --> 01:04:47,120
Oh, come on - when a fellow as you
lets down his pal at the Hippodrom

869
01:04:47,200 --> 01:04:50,481
- and still doesn't go to sea...
- and drives 'round the habor in a launch...

870
01:04:50,581 --> 01:04:52,973
There's for sure some
long-haired female behind it!

871
01:04:53,093 --> 01:04:56,426
Oh now don't talk
such muddled nonsense.

872
01:04:57,236 --> 01:04:59,314
Eh, Hannes - clear deck:

873
01:04:59,434 --> 01:05:01,608
You want to marry, right?

874
01:05:05,765 --> 01:05:08,183
Maybe... yes...

875
01:05:08,677 --> 01:05:10,356
if she wants me...

876
01:05:10,476 --> 01:05:13,609
- What... you didn't ask her yet?
- No...

877
01:05:13,729 --> 01:05:16,559
This time it's all much different.

878
01:05:16,679 --> 01:05:19,741
Who... who is it?
Do we know her?

879
01:05:19,861 --> 01:05:22,103
No, she's from out of town!

880
01:05:22,223 --> 01:05:24,232
When is she coming?

881
01:05:24,352 --> 01:05:27,073
"Coming"... she already lives with me!

882
01:05:28,707 --> 01:05:31,640
Man eh....
He's a sly old dog, eh?

883
01:05:31,760 --> 01:05:34,402
No, not what you think,
wham-bam, thank you ma'am,

884
01:05:34,522 --> 01:05:37,081
free concert on the City Hall market...

885
01:05:37,201 --> 01:05:38,921
Paloma, she's much different...

886
01:05:39,041 --> 01:05:41,128
- What's the girl's name?
- Well, Gisa!

887
01:05:41,248 --> 01:05:43,183
But you just said "Paloma"...

888
01:05:43,303 --> 01:05:46,717
You need something
to wash your ears, Jens!

889
01:05:47,985 --> 01:05:51,266
How... does Gisa look like?

890
01:05:51,386 --> 01:05:54,645
- Is she pretty?
- Sure...!

891
01:05:55,362 --> 01:05:58,321
And homely and busy
and accurate and...

892
01:05:59,305 --> 01:06:02,508
and all...
and a respectable girl, too.

893
01:06:02,628 --> 01:06:04,930
I didn't believe
something like that still existed.

894
01:06:05,050 --> 01:06:07,583
Boy oh boy oh boy...

895
01:06:08,101 --> 01:06:11,753
- Tcha, in that case...
- Pity, isn't it?

896
01:06:11,873 --> 01:06:16,168
Pity, that we now...
won't get to know your Paloma!

897
01:06:16,790 --> 01:06:20,644
- Why?   - Day after tomorrow
we'll be already back at sea...

898
01:06:22,803 --> 01:06:25,198
- Wanna see her?
- Sure!   - Yes, man!

899
01:06:25,318 --> 01:06:26,777
- Here goes! Come along!
- Yeah!

900
01:06:27,488 --> 01:06:29,994
Go ahead!

901
01:06:31,897 --> 01:06:33,963
But first wipe your kicks!

902
01:06:34,539 --> 01:06:36,863
Gisa! I bring visitors!

903
01:06:37,157 --> 01:06:39,282
Don't be shy!

904
01:06:41,098 --> 01:06:42,930
Gisa!
Sit down!

905
01:06:45,466 --> 01:06:46,934
Gisa!

906
01:06:48,354 --> 01:06:50,280
Where are you, girl?

907
01:06:51,375 --> 01:06:52,491
Gisa!

908
01:06:53,500 --> 01:06:55,438
Aren't you here?

909
01:06:56,107 --> 01:06:56,894
Well...

910
01:06:58,094 --> 01:06:58,799
Oh...

911
01:06:59,030 --> 01:07:00,748
She's probably away
for a moment...

912
01:07:00,868 --> 01:07:03,364
<i>"Dear Hannes -"</i>
That's for you only...

913
01:07:03,484 --> 01:07:06,114
<i>"The meal's in the caboose
on the tray.</i>

914
01:07:06,234 --> 01:07:08,850
<i>Since you didn't come back
I went for a walk with a friend."</i>

915
01:07:08,970 --> 01:07:12,156
<i>"How about Sagebiel?
I'm waiting downstairs -</i>

916
01:07:12,276 --> 01:07:14,469
<i>Willem without tie"</i>

917
01:07:14,589 --> 01:07:17,590
- What are you blabbering?
- That's on the other side.

918
01:07:20,513 --> 01:07:23,120
White dove... gone!

919
01:07:26,748 --> 01:07:28,004
Sagebiel...

920
01:08:12,345 --> 01:08:13,214
<i>Bill please!</i>

921
01:08:27,334 --> 01:08:28,955
Shall we go?

922
01:08:30,493 --> 01:08:31,737
Yes.

923
01:08:37,903 --> 01:08:40,272
- Waiter, the bill please...
- Colleague coming up!

924
01:08:40,392 --> 01:08:41,413
<i>Bill please!</i>

925
01:08:44,560 --> 01:08:45,676
Well...

926
01:08:46,028 --> 01:08:47,049
You...?

927
01:08:47,877 --> 01:08:49,991
Is it allowed...?

928
01:08:50,100 --> 01:08:50,990
Hannes...!

929
01:08:55,257 --> 01:08:56,889
No!
Come sit down.

930
01:08:57,009 --> 01:09:00,363
- I didn't ask you!
- Waiter, the bill please!

931
01:09:00,790 --> 01:09:02,108
- I was about to leave...
- What did the gentlemen have?

932
01:09:02,228 --> 01:09:03,981
- Well we had...
- What did you have?  - One cake...

933
01:09:04,101 --> 01:09:06,039
What's at this table is on me!

934
01:09:06,159 --> 01:09:08,538
Perhaps the gentlemen
settle this first.

935
01:09:33,857 --> 01:09:37,086
Hello, gentlemen,
I still get 6 mark 20!

936
01:09:50,800 --> 01:09:52,326
Now come along...

937
01:10:11,358 --> 01:10:14,880
Gisa - if you need me:
I live at Steckelhörn 3.

938
01:10:15,000 --> 01:10:17,369
- How do you know that bloke anyway?
- From the store.   - Ah!

939
01:10:17,489 --> 01:10:21,102
- And he's not a bloke but a very
decent person.   - A windbag he is!

940
01:10:21,222 --> 01:10:23,598
Oh, you've already met more often?
- No!    - Yeah?

941
01:10:23,718 --> 01:10:26,486
And last Sunday at the barge
it was just pure coincidence!

942
01:10:26,606 --> 01:10:28,539
As for my part for sure!

943
01:10:28,797 --> 01:10:31,322
- Don't tell me lies, girl!
- Stop yelling!

944
01:10:31,442 --> 01:10:33,835
Not everybody needs to hear this!
They're already talking about us anyway!

945
01:10:33,955 --> 01:10:36,565
They should better care
about their own shit!

946
01:10:36,685 --> 01:10:39,383
What's between us
is no one else's business!

947
01:10:43,861 --> 01:10:46,069
You didn' even turn off the radio!

948
01:10:46,189 --> 01:10:49,168
You seem to have been
in a great hurry!

949
01:10:50,487 --> 01:10:51,860
What the...

950
01:10:55,723 --> 01:10:58,119
- There you are, Hannes!
- What are <i>you</i> doing here?

951
01:10:58,239 --> 01:11:02,790
I was caught in the rain nearby...
Luckily, I had the keys with me.

952
01:11:02,889 --> 01:11:06,086
G'day, Miss!
God, you're drenched!

953
01:11:06,206 --> 01:11:09,853
Well that's Miss Häuptlein,
a distant relative of mine.

954
01:11:09,973 --> 01:11:13,101
- And this is...
- Anita Schröder is my name.

955
01:11:13,221 --> 01:11:15,724
Yeah... that's my boss.

956
01:11:15,844 --> 01:11:18,395
One might also say so...

957
01:11:20,282 --> 01:11:23,937
And now get changed quickly!
Or you'll catch a cold!

958
01:11:24,057 --> 01:11:26,687
Can't have that with my entertainer!

959
01:11:28,111 --> 01:11:31,128
- I'll make us a nice coffee.
- But I can do that!

960
01:11:31,248 --> 01:11:34,193
Never mind, Miss,
after all I'm here at home.

961
01:11:36,902 --> 01:11:39,732
Jens told me various things -
for how long has this been going with her?

962
01:11:39,852 --> 01:11:42,186
Gisa? That was the bride of my brother!

963
01:11:42,306 --> 01:11:45,211
Ah, and now you took her over -
stays in the family, eh?

964
01:11:45,331 --> 01:11:48,851
Get the hell out of here, babe, eh!

965
01:11:49,121 --> 01:11:53,231
<i>The first time it still hurts...</i>

966
01:11:53,351 --> 01:11:57,329
<i>you still think
you will never get over it...</i>

967
01:11:57,622 --> 01:11:59,571
Where are my grey stockings?

968
01:11:59,691 --> 01:12:02,636
I darned them and
put them in your wardrobe.

969
01:12:02,953 --> 01:12:06,685
<i>...you get used to it!</i>

970
01:12:10,342 --> 01:12:13,307
- Put on stockings, honey!
- Yes!

971
01:12:15,127 --> 01:12:16,512
Now, now!

972
01:12:17,812 --> 01:12:20,818
He's also one
you have take as he is.

973
01:12:22,521 --> 01:12:26,547
- Are you with him for a long time?
- I'm in Hamburg for only a month.

974
01:12:26,667 --> 01:12:29,095
In the beginning
he's always very likable.

975
01:12:29,215 --> 01:12:31,866
Later it will
sort itself out, unfortunately.

976
01:12:32,641 --> 01:12:34,849
You have a nice figure...

977
01:12:35,576 --> 01:12:38,321
But sailors are hard to keep.

978
01:12:38,627 --> 01:12:41,280
Hannes doesn't want to have
anything more to do with the sea.

979
01:12:41,715 --> 01:12:45,695
Dogs, that bark a lot...
one day he'll sign on again anyway.

980
01:12:45,815 --> 01:12:47,973
I know the guys.

981
01:12:48,093 --> 01:12:50,483
Or do you perhaps think
he'll marry you?

982
01:12:50,603 --> 01:12:53,830
You think because he didn't marry you?

983
01:12:54,722 --> 01:12:56,965
Me, marrying such a bloke?

984
01:12:57,085 --> 01:12:59,204
Hannes is not a bloke.

985
01:12:59,571 --> 01:13:02,401
He's a decent person...
a very decent person.

986
01:13:02,521 --> 01:13:05,747
He knows exactly what he's doing.
Just like me.

987
01:13:07,261 --> 01:13:10,850
Your water's boiling...
how much hotter do you want it?

988
01:13:17,463 --> 01:13:21,338
Earlier... on the stairs,
I guess I was a bit...

989
01:13:22,148 --> 01:13:24,473
a bit loud towards you... Paloma?

990
01:13:24,593 --> 01:13:26,903
"A bit" is good...

991
01:13:30,701 --> 01:13:33,942
You have to understand this, girl...

992
01:13:34,553 --> 01:13:37,265
I have my reasons for it.

993
01:13:37,385 --> 01:13:40,151
And now all the more,
since I know, that you...

994
01:13:42,969 --> 01:13:46,148
Help me with my buttons
please, will you?

995
01:13:46,268 --> 01:13:49,744
Now I really have to say: The
apartment is in immaculate good shape.

996
01:13:49,846 --> 01:13:52,969
New tableware, new curtains,
and the tablecloth's also new to me.

997
01:13:53,089 --> 01:13:55,009
But as you now live here permanently.

998
01:13:55,129 --> 01:13:57,736
And I just dropped by for short chat.

999
01:13:57,856 --> 01:14:00,378
But it was nice anyway, Hannes, no?

1000
01:14:00,498 --> 01:14:02,462
Now let's talk about something else!

1001
01:14:02,582 --> 01:14:04,798
Just leave it to draw a little bit more.

1002
01:14:06,430 --> 01:14:08,978
Have you ever heared our Hannes sing?

1003
01:14:09,098 --> 01:14:12,535
- Yes, on the radio.
- God, on the radio... that's nothing.

1004
01:14:12,655 --> 01:14:16,715
You have to hear him at the Hippodrom,
you will not recognize him!

1005
01:14:16,835 --> 01:14:18,488
He does not want me to go there.

1006
01:14:18,608 --> 01:14:22,152
But why not, Hannes,
my venue is not a dive?!

1007
01:14:22,272 --> 01:14:24,996
I also have very good guests,
they all come because of Hannes.

1008
01:14:25,116 --> 01:14:27,779
- Especially the ladies.
- Now stop talking such rubbish!

1009
01:14:27,899 --> 01:14:30,477
Oh come on, Hannes...
the Consul's wife for example!

1010
01:14:30,597 --> 01:14:34,091
She's there only because of you...
in fact she's totally crazy about him.

1011
01:14:34,211 --> 01:14:36,293
She wants to take him to
the Hansa Theater by all means.

1012
01:14:36,413 --> 01:14:38,273
Will we now have coffee or not?

1013
01:14:38,393 --> 01:14:39,976
I don't want no coffee,
Mrs. Kassbohm!

1014
01:14:40,096 --> 01:14:41,979
You don't want any coffee,
you don't want to eat,

1015
01:14:42,099 --> 01:14:44,191
probably didn't work out
with the new bride, eh?

1016
01:14:44,311 --> 01:14:47,249
- Leave me alone! I have to go!
- At that weather?

1017
01:14:47,369 --> 01:14:50,361
Do you want to ruin the blue suit
just as that one?

1018
01:14:50,481 --> 01:14:53,874
- What are you up to?
- Have to kick someone out of his suit!

1019
01:14:54,545 --> 01:14:59,007
<i>The first time it still hurts,</i>

1020
01:14:59,127 --> 01:15:03,082
<i>you still think
you will never get over it,</i>

1021
01:15:03,202 --> 01:15:05,858
<i>but by and by, and bit by bit</i>

1022
01:15:05,978 --> 01:15:07,136
Gimme the trumpet!

1023
01:15:07,256 --> 01:15:10,438
<i>you get used to it!</i>

1024
01:15:18,286 --> 01:15:22,375
- Here he's in his element!
- He looks totally changed.

1025
01:15:24,073 --> 01:15:28,524
I tell you, Hannes belongs to
the Great Freedom and nowhere else.

1026
01:15:29,779 --> 01:15:35,047
<i>Her first, he was a sailor
who was tattooed on his chest.</i>

1027
01:15:35,167 --> 01:15:37,066
Over there,
that's the Consul's wife.

1028
01:15:37,186 --> 01:15:41,279
<i>He wore ocean blue trousers
and she was so terribly shy.</i>

1029
01:15:41,399 --> 01:15:43,477
- Evening!
- Evening, Fiete!

1030
01:15:43,597 --> 01:15:46,739
- Ah, a new one?
- That's Miss Gisa.

1031
01:15:47,618 --> 01:15:49,344
Oh, that's you?

1032
01:15:49,464 --> 01:15:52,586
Brinkmann... Fiete Brinkmann
is my name...

1033
01:15:52,819 --> 01:15:56,065
Jens and me, we're
old friends of Hannes!

1034
01:15:56,751 --> 01:15:58,489
Jens - what do you think of her?

1035
01:15:58,609 --> 01:16:01,422
Kill 'er...
just kill 'er!

1036
01:16:01,542 --> 01:16:03,667
- Whom?
- Over there!

1037
01:16:03,787 --> 01:16:06,306
- What's your name?
- Hein Olsen.

1038
01:16:06,426 --> 01:16:09,089
Hein? Oh, now that's
a beautiful name, isn't it?

1039
01:16:09,209 --> 01:16:10,956
Tcha!

1040
01:16:11,076 --> 01:16:13,375
When did you sign off, eh?

1041
01:16:13,495 --> 01:16:16,002
If he gets intimate
I'll kill him!

1042
01:16:16,122 --> 01:16:18,726
After Hannes has finished
I will show you the ass ride!

1043
01:16:18,846 --> 01:16:21,415
- Ass ride? Are here any asses?
- More than enough.

1044
01:16:21,535 --> 01:16:25,243
- Where's Bimbo?
- In his stable. Can't walk.

1045
01:16:25,363 --> 01:16:28,571
- Too bad, isn't it?
- He still can't walk?

1046
01:16:28,691 --> 01:16:30,497
He needs a kick in the ass!

1047
01:16:30,617 --> 01:16:37,308
<i>To be faithful, he said, I can try it,
though I've never been faithful before.</i>

1048
01:16:37,428 --> 01:16:44,828
<i>If it's a boy, call him Johnny,
if it's a girl, call her Mary.</i>

1049
01:16:44,948 --> 01:16:51,659
<i>He did not come to the wedding,
at the baptism, he was not there</i>

1050
01:16:51,779 --> 01:16:54,401
<i>so one day she took another -</i>

1051
01:16:54,521 --> 01:16:55,645
Oh, I see...

1052
01:16:55,765 --> 01:16:59,450
<i>and now Johnny calls the other Daddy...</i>

1053
01:16:59,570 --> 01:17:02,766
Don't laugh,
it happens in the best families!

1054
01:17:02,886 --> 01:17:04,469
All sing along! Ballet!

1055
01:17:04,589 --> 01:17:09,037
<i>The first time it still hurts</i>

1056
01:17:09,617 --> 01:17:11,645
Why don't you say hello?

1057
01:17:11,765 --> 01:17:14,572
Could be inconvenient for your bloke.

1058
01:17:15,124 --> 01:17:18,504
- What's the matter?
- Leave me alone!

1059
01:17:35,096 --> 01:17:36,693
Hannes!

1060
01:17:37,621 --> 01:17:39,325
That does it!

1061
01:17:44,458 --> 01:17:45,882
Excuse me, I didn't mean you!

1062
01:17:46,002 --> 01:17:47,713
Get out of here, this is
no place for you any more, okay?

1063
01:17:49,000 --> 01:17:51,644
But what... what's that to you?
I mean...

1064
01:17:51,764 --> 01:17:54,364
Sorry, but I didn't mean you!
Don't touch me, okay?

1065
01:17:55,116 --> 01:17:56,630
That ape!

1066
01:17:56,971 --> 01:17:58,262
Don't touch me!

1067
01:18:00,681 --> 01:18:02,516
- We'll talk later!
- You bet!

1068
01:18:02,636 --> 01:18:04,200
Too bad you're mother
will not recognize you!

1069
01:18:04,300 --> 01:18:05,686
All mouth and no trousers!

1070
01:18:05,806 --> 01:18:08,454
'Cause your nose will sit
on the back of your neck!

1071
01:18:08,574 --> 01:18:10,966
And your nose...
flies from your face!

1072
01:18:11,315 --> 01:18:12,774
Police!

1073
01:18:14,712 --> 01:18:16,626
Come along, gentlemen!

1074
01:18:40,272 --> 01:18:41,893
Tearing off my bow-tie, eh?

1075
01:18:57,985 --> 01:19:00,731
When did you sign off?

1076
01:19:15,135 --> 01:19:17,003
Wait a minute!

1077
01:19:20,336 --> 01:19:22,015
Allleeee...

1078
01:19:22,135 --> 01:19:23,976
...let them have it!

1079
01:19:52,124 --> 01:19:54,496
What happened, Kröger?

1080
01:19:55,303 --> 01:19:58,978
- Internal family celebration,
officer...    - Yeah...

1081
01:19:59,718 --> 01:20:04,324
Tcha... better take care that
it doesn't become a private function!

1082
01:20:11,199 --> 01:20:13,512
Will you finally
leave the girl alone?

1083
01:20:13,632 --> 01:20:17,427
Your bitch can get lost, pal... who
wants a floosie of the Great Feedom!

1084
01:20:17,547 --> 01:20:19,987
Ah you... you bumpkin!

1085
01:20:41,301 --> 01:20:43,579
Are you asleep, Gisa?

1086
01:20:45,099 --> 01:20:46,249
No...

1087
01:20:49,373 --> 01:20:52,908
If you just hadn't come
to the Hippodrom tonight...

1088
01:20:56,842 --> 01:21:02,284
I have no idea why suddenly there
was such a wild clobbering under way.

1089
01:21:05,982 --> 01:21:08,318
But perhaps it all had to be...

1090
01:21:08,438 --> 01:21:11,007
now I know at least
where I'm at with that guy.

1091
01:21:11,928 --> 01:21:16,754
It's easy to drag a respectable
girl through the mud...

1092
01:21:18,292 --> 01:21:22,825
- What did he?
- He thinks you're one of the streets!

1093
01:21:24,045 --> 01:21:25,114
No...!

1094
01:21:25,631 --> 01:21:29,071
"A floosie of the
Great Freedom" he said.

1095
01:21:32,734 --> 01:21:36,318
You don't have to be upset about
what such an idiot says,

1096
01:21:36,438 --> 01:21:38,549
it doesn't matter to you.

1097
01:21:39,418 --> 01:21:43,398
What's that strange guy
to you anyway, girl...

1098
01:21:45,043 --> 01:21:46,878
you've got me!

1099
01:21:56,508 --> 01:22:00,688
The last few days I already
wanted to talk to you about it...

1100
01:22:01,252 --> 01:22:06,206
I'm leaving the Great Freedom,
in the long run that's no life.

1101
01:22:08,751 --> 01:22:11,874
With Anita, that's not
was it used to be,

1102
01:22:11,994 --> 01:22:14,469
and the other women...

1103
01:22:15,087 --> 01:22:18,748
it comes and goes, the way it is,
after all ...

1104
01:22:18,868 --> 01:22:21,275
after all one's a man.

1105
01:22:22,907 --> 01:22:25,854
The Consul's wife...

1106
01:22:25,974 --> 01:22:29,427
she wanted to get me to the
Hansa Theater by all means, but...

1107
01:22:30,782 --> 01:22:32,914
it's better that way.

1108
01:22:33,618 --> 01:22:37,353
And if you hadn't come
I would've gone back to sea anyway,

1109
01:22:37,473 --> 01:22:40,056
it's still more powerful
than one would think.

1110
01:22:42,666 --> 01:22:45,461
Then comes the death of my brother...

1111
01:22:46,529 --> 01:22:48,619
and then you...

1112
01:22:50,674 --> 01:22:53,046
and then everything is different.

1113
01:22:59,824 --> 01:23:03,570
"Sail clear" said the Admiral, Gisa...

1114
01:23:04,404 --> 01:23:07,915
I will buy the barge,
you can count on that...

1115
01:23:08,035 --> 01:23:09,665
and then you will see

1116
01:23:09,785 --> 01:23:13,140
how light and blue the sky will be...
and then...

1117
01:23:14,033 --> 01:23:17,954
we put my stuff
and your stuff together

1118
01:23:20,514 --> 01:23:22,933
and then getting married...

1119
01:23:23,053 --> 01:23:26,262
There's a nice saying
on merchant ships:

1120
01:23:26,602 --> 01:23:29,702
Fine weather and a good trip...

1121
01:23:32,214 --> 01:23:34,303
tomorrow again...

Nothing... nothing at all...

one thing I can tell you, man...

1170
01:28:53,890 --> 01:28:57,119
Our Hannes is lost for seafaring.

1172
01:29:04,235 --> 01:29:06,971
I'm glad we're at sea again tomorrow.

1173
01:29:10,928 --> 01:29:14,258
Hey Jens, Fiete, it's almost 7
and you're not yet ready!

1174
01:29:14,378 --> 01:29:17,240
- I'll stay on board.
- You're both mad.

1175
01:29:17,360 --> 01:29:19,248
I want to stay in Hamburg forever.

1176
01:29:19,368 --> 01:29:22,539
Hamburg is the most beautiful city of
the world, not even Cologne can compete.

1177
01:29:22,659 --> 01:29:25,087
I'm sick and tired of Hamburg.

1178
01:29:25,956 --> 01:29:27,095
Owww....

1179
01:29:27,215 --> 01:29:29,091
Come, go ahead, get in!

1180
01:29:29,211 --> 01:29:31,064
and put it down there... so...

1181
01:29:31,184 --> 01:29:33,645
You... you couldn't find
any higher place to live?

1182

You better be glad
that I'm no lighthouse keeper!

Come here... here's 50 mark...

01:29:42,209 --> 01:29:45,809
- There's nothing wrong in asking, no?
- Now don't stand around here...

1186
01:29:45,929 --> 01:29:48,149
better go to the kitchen,
Gisa will be here any moment!

1187
01:29:50,615 --> 01:29:52,282
Well good night, Mr. Wellenkamp,

1188
01:29:52,402 --> 01:29:54,854
I will unpack the new buscherumps
tomorrow, all right?

1189
01:29:54,974 --> 01:29:57,346
It's all right, girl,
there's no hurry.

1190
01:29:57,466 --> 01:30:00,458
But you better go now -
for sure he's already waiting!

1191
01:30:01,867 --> 01:30:04,274
For me no one is waiting...

1192
01:30:05,131 --> 01:30:09,664
Say, Mr. Wellenkamp...
where's that... Steckelhörnstreet?

1193
01:30:11,627 --> 01:30:14,598
A young lady is here...
she wants to see you.

1194
01:30:14,718 --> 01:30:17,208
- What young lady?
- I don't know her.

1195
01:30:17,328 --> 01:30:19,169
She hasn't been here before.

1196
01:30:24,002 --> 01:30:27,098
- Don't you want to put on
at least a little bit?    - Why?

1197
01:30:28,496 --> 01:30:30,433
What are <i>you</i> doing here?

1198
01:30:30,553 --> 01:30:32,600
I have to tell you something.

1199
01:30:32,981 --> 01:30:34,860
Yes? Please?

1200
01:30:48,490 --> 01:30:53,469
<i>You're lucky with the ladies, Bel Ami...</i>

1201
01:30:53,739 --> 01:30:57,437
<i>so lucky with the ladies, Bel Ami...</i>

1202
01:30:57,972 --> 01:31:00,672
<i>you're not handsome,
but you've got charme...</i>

1203
01:31:00,792 --> 01:31:02,469

1204

1205
01:31:07,048 --> 01:31:07,858
So...

1206
01:31:14,342 --> 01:31:16,843
<i>just a man...</i>

1207
01:31:17,489 --> 01:31:19,720

01:31:25,981 --> 01:31:29,200
<i>you kiss them all

1210
01:31:29,320 --> 01:31:32,617
<i>but the woman who loves you...</i>

1211
01:31:33,732 --> 01:31:34,953
Huh?

1212
01:31:35,353 --> 01:31:38,629
How can one marry in house
with such narrow doors?

1213
01:31:45,817 --> 01:31:48,605
<i>Bel Ami, Bel Ami...</i>

1214
01:31:48,725 --> 01:31:51,176
<i>Bel Ami... yep!</i>

1215
01:31:52,500 --> 01:31:53,498
Yes...

1216
01:31:54,731 --> 01:31:57,902
And I really thought
you had something going with him.

1217
01:31:58,606 --> 01:32:02,293
Then I wouldn't have come - no?

1218
01:32:02,413 --> 01:32:03,385
No.

1219
01:32:17,095 --> 01:32:20,136
I guess you haven't had
anything to eat yet, right?

1220
01:32:20,256 --> 01:32:23,013
Then... then I'll...
wait a moment.

1221
01:32:24,980 --> 01:32:26,962
Mrs. Kaasbohm?

1222
01:32:28,148 --> 01:32:31,283
Oh couldn't we have some more tea,
please, Mother Kaasbohm?

1223
01:32:31,403 --> 01:32:35,356
- Is this the new bride, from Sunday?
- Do you like her?

1224
01:32:35,450 --> 01:32:37,000
Beats me!

1225
01:32:51,597 --> 01:32:53,382
Young man...

1226
01:32:56,619 --> 01:32:58,357
Lil' one...

1227
01:33:00,752 --> 01:33:03,676
Hello... hello,
stay here, eh!

1228
01:33:22,762 --> 01:33:26,238
Carl Wellenkamp,
The House for the Sailor...

1229
01:33:26,473 --> 01:33:29,788
No, Hannes, she left here
at seven prompt.

1230
01:33:30,081 --> 01:33:34,144
Now what could have happened.
She's no small child anymore.

1231
01:33:34,264 --> 01:33:36,457
She probably has to do some shopping...

1232
01:33:36,577 --> 01:33:41,211
...I'm sure!
She asked me about the Steckelhörn!

1233
01:33:46,987 --> 01:33:49,129
What's the matter, Mr. Kröger?

1234
01:33:51,125 --> 01:33:52,288
Nothing...

1235
01:33:53,180 --> 01:33:54,801
Nothing at all...

1236
01:34:01,899 --> 01:34:04,005
WHO DARES WINS

1237
01:34:05,503 --> 01:34:08,177
When did it start for you?

1238
01:34:08,297 --> 01:34:10,610
Well... wait...

1239
01:34:11,743 --> 01:34:15,771
- Actually, already at the Bajazzo...
- What Bajazzo?

1240
01:34:16,381 --> 01:34:18,686
The gambling machine!

1241
01:34:18,806 --> 01:34:21,187
- At Mrs. Börgel, downstairs
at your place!  - Yes...

1242
01:34:21,307 --> 01:34:25,895
Don't you remember... back then...
when you shoved me?

1243
01:34:26,015 --> 01:34:30,091
I couldn't stand you then...
you were so cheeky!

1244
01:34:31,206 --> 01:34:33,989
And when did it start for you?

1245
01:34:34,109 --> 01:34:37,059
- Also at a slot machine...
- But you just said...

1246
01:34:37,179 --> 01:34:39,560
No - not at Mrs. Börgel's...

1247
01:34:40,241 --> 01:34:42,836
- At Blankenese...
- I see...

1248
01:34:59,899 --> 01:35:03,187
Never let it be said
that slot machines were no good.

1249
01:35:45,512 --> 01:35:47,350
Say that again...!

1250
01:35:47,470 --> 01:35:49,290
But I can say it only once...

1251
01:35:49,410 --> 01:35:53,024
- But I want to hear it once more...
- But I won't say it!

1252
01:35:56,010 --> 01:35:58,524
<i>[ Your own peaceful home
is a piece of paradise ]</i>

1253
01:36:04,157 --> 01:36:07,627
That's pretty!
Where did you get the necklace?

1254
01:36:08,143 --> 01:36:09,999
It's from...

1255
01:36:11,102 --> 01:36:12,570
from the South Sea.

1256
01:36:12,981 --> 01:36:14,002
Ah...

1257
01:36:23,583 --> 01:36:27,504
- I'll find me a room tomorrow.
- But nearby, okay?

1258
01:36:28,824 --> 01:36:31,430
I'm afraid of tomorrow anyway.

1259
01:36:31,994 --> 01:36:33,509
Why that?

1260
01:36:33,629 --> 01:36:37,031
Do you think I don't know you
anymore tomorrow?     - No.

1261
01:36:43,774 --> 01:36:47,379
No... it's just because of...

1262
01:36:47,625 --> 01:36:49,266
Maybe it will hurt him.

1263
01:36:49,386 --> 01:36:51,990
Why? You didn't have
anything going with him!

1264
01:36:52,110 --> 01:36:53,587
No, it's not that...

1265
01:36:54,373 --> 01:36:56,792
But he was so different
in the last few days...

1266
01:36:56,912 --> 01:36:59,449
Sometimes I almost had the feeling...

1267
01:36:59,754 --> 01:37:02,102
I had that feeling from the start.

1268
01:37:02,844 --> 01:37:05,522
- He never said anything, but...
- See?

1269
01:37:05,642 --> 01:37:08,334
Then you don't need
to have a bad conscience.

1270
01:37:08,557 --> 01:37:11,422
- I just feel so ungrateful.
- But why...?

1271
01:37:11,542 --> 01:37:14,486
You looked after for him all those weeks!

1272
01:37:15,662 --> 01:37:18,398
Seems to be mighty hard for you, eh?

1273
01:37:20,241 --> 01:37:22,754
Don't talk such nonsense...

1274
01:37:26,445 --> 01:37:29,568
Wait... I've got something for you!

1275
01:37:30,860 --> 01:37:33,913
- You always wanted to exchange
your tie!     - Too late!

1276
01:37:34,033 --> 01:37:35,768
That suit is ruined.

1277
01:37:37,843 --> 01:37:40,790
Do you perhaps think
I'm dependent on her?

1278
01:37:43,361 --> 01:37:46,215
Whether you think
that I'm dependent on her, eh?

1279
01:37:48,375 --> 01:37:51,169
I'm not dependent on her!

1280
01:37:52,085 --> 01:37:53,236
Bye.

1281
01:37:53,356 --> 01:37:56,478
- Where do you want to go?
- To Margot.   - Come here!

1282
01:38:03,996 --> 01:38:05,264
Come in!

1283

<i>What use to me is a pretty girl</i>

1285

1287

1288
01:38:37,992 --> 01:38:39,527
Get out!

1289
01:38:46,397 --> 01:38:47,959
What's the matter with you?

1290
01:38:49,309 --> 01:38:50,871
Leave me alone...

1291
01:39:06,558 --> 01:39:09,516
- What's with Hannes?
- Shut up!

1292
01:39:10,268 --> 01:39:11,289
There...

1293
01:39:13,262 --> 01:39:15,034
Engagement rings...

1294
01:39:24,384 --> 01:39:25,617
Hannes...

1295
01:39:26,909 --> 01:39:28,987
Never mind...

1296
01:39:33,378 --> 01:39:35,278
You have to get out of here.

1297
01:39:35,642 --> 01:39:38,342
Don't you want
to join up with us again?

1298
01:39:39,094 --> 01:39:41,830
But aren't you...
already complete?

1299
01:39:41,950 --> 01:39:45,918
- No, we're not!  - No?
- Well, Karl! from Cologne...

1300
01:39:46,038 --> 01:39:49,299
He'd like to stay here,
he likes Hamburg a lot,

1301
01:39:49,419 --> 01:39:52,477
- if he finds a replacement.
- All of a sudden?

1302
01:39:53,275 --> 01:39:56,680
- How come?
- Oh...

1303
01:39:59,029 --> 01:40:00,778
...old story.

1304
01:40:01,037 --> 01:40:04,219
Ah... because of a woman.

1305
01:40:13,071 --> 01:40:14,257
No...

1306
01:40:17,873 --> 01:40:21,689
- No.   - The captain has a telephone,
I could get it straight quickly!

1307
01:40:23,392 --> 01:40:25,306
Back to sea...

1308
01:40:27,079 --> 01:40:29,064
At sea again...

1309
01:40:43,584 --> 01:40:48,871
<i>They celebrate a wedding...</i>

What's wrong with you?

1316
01:41:17,255 --> 01:41:19,674
I cannot forget Margot.

1317
01:41:19,794 --> 01:41:22,081
Have you lost your marbles, eh?

1318
01:41:25,437 --> 01:41:28,349
You're crying... because of a woman?

1319
01:41:29,159 --> 01:41:31,014
Let her go!

1320
01:41:31,331 --> 01:41:35,358
<i>'Cause you are a sailor...</i>

Hey, tomorrow...

1323
01:41:41,616 --> 01:41:44,807
you will be on sea again and then
everything will look different!

1324
01:41:45,184 --> 01:41:48,612
You... <i>always keep sailing...</i>

1325

<i>under the heaven so hot...</i>

1326
01:41:55,368 --> 01:41:59,325
And when you're standing
up there on the yard again,

1327
01:42:00,011 --> 01:42:04,367
and the wind howls
in your ears up there, eh!

1328
01:42:05,189 --> 01:42:07,526
then you'll forget everything...

1329
01:42:07,878 --> 01:42:12,261
Jens, don't you remember
what our captain back then

1330
01:42:12,381 --> 01:42:15,642
wrote into our fleet calendar
for christmas?

1331

And when you come home again

1335
01:42:32,413 --> 01:42:35,571
then perhaps you no longer know

01:42:36,029 --> 01:42:39,141

1337
