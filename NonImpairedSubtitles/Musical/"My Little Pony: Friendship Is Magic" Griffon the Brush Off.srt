 a sun superstar, flying higher and higher,

2
00:00:06,002 --> 00:00:08,615
and then Rainbow Dash swooshed down-SWOOSH!

3
00:00:08,615 --> 00:00:10,240
and right before she hit the ground, SHOOM!

Twilight: (distracted) Uh-huh.

6
00:00:12,539 --> 00:00:17,043

00:08:18,161 --> 00:08:22,025
Huh. Well, I groove on a good prank as much as the next griffon,

156
00:08:22,248 --> 00:08:25,087
but Dash, you promised me we'd get a flying session in this morning.

157
00:08:25,087 --> 00:08:30,038
Yeah...uh...well, Pinkie Pie, you don't mind, do you?

158
00:08:30,375 --> 00:08:35,067
Rainbow Dash: Gilda just got here. We'll catch up 
 with you later!
Pinkie Pie: Oh...um...sure, no problem!

159
00:08:35,669 --> 00:08:41,006
Have fun, you guys! So I'll...just catch up with you... (sighs dejectedly) later...

160
00:08:41,242 --> 00:08:43,024
(party blower blowing sad descending note)

161
00:08:43,981 --> 00:08:45,042
(wind blowing)

162
00:08:45,421 --> 00:08:49,004
(jets whoosh by)

163
00:08:49,043 --> 00:08:51,074
(wind howling, Gilda streaks past)

164
00:08:54,291 --> 00:08:55,031
(approaching jet, soft thud)

165
00:08:55,313 --> 00:09:00,014
(both laughing)
Gilda: Whoa! That was sweet!

166
00:09:00,143 --> 00:09:01,068
Just like old times.

167
00:09:01,675 --> 00:09:04,079
Rainbow Dash: Yeah, only faster!
(brohoof)

168
00:09:04,787 --> 00:09:05,067
So, now what?

169
00:09:05,669 --> 00:09:06,064
Pinkie Pie: Hey there!

170
00:09:06,644 --> 00:09:07,067
Both: Huh?

171
00:09:07,666 --> 00:09:08,097
Pinkie Pie: It's later!

172
00:09:08,966 --> 00:09:10,054
Pinkie Pie: And I caught up!

173
00:09:10,545 --> 00:09:15,000
(Pinkie Pie bouncing on trampoline)

174
00:09:15,003 --> 00:09:18,053
(Pinkie Pie bouncing)
Rainbow Dash: Pinkie Pie, you are so random!

175
00:09:18,533 --> 00:09:23,041
(Pinkie Pie bouncing)
Gilda: Hey Dash, think you got enough 
 gas left to beat me to that cloud?!

176
00:09:23,409 --> 00:09:25,092
(Pinkie Pie bouncing)
Rainbow Dash: A race?! You are so on!

177
00:09:25,917 --> 00:09:28,010
Gilda: One, two, three, GO! (whoosh)

178
00:09:28,099 --> 00:09:29,021
Pinkie Pie: Hey...!

179
00:09:30,259 --> 00:09:31,056
Rainbow Dash: I win!

180
00:09:31,559 --> 00:09:33,088
Gilda: As IF. I won, dude!

181
00:09:33,881 --> 00:09:35,088
Rainbow Dash: No way!
Gilda: Yes way!

182
00:09:35,878 --> 00:09:38,088
Rainbow Dash: Oh come on, I was way ahead 
 of you!
Gilda: Uh, I don't think so.

183
00:09:38,875 --> 00:09:41,036
Rainbow Dash: Oh please, dream on. There is NO way 
 you beat me.
Gilda: Remember back in camp? I-

184
00:09:41,358 --> 00:09:43,073
Pinkie Pie: Wow, guys, that was really cool!

185
00:09:43,726 --> 00:09:46,002
But I think Rainbow Dash beat you by a teeny-weeny, itty-bitty little hair,

186
00:09:46,025 --> 00:09:48,007
or a teeny-weeny, itty-bitty feather!

187
00:09:48,069 --> 00:09:52,067
Rainbow Dash: Hah, see?! Good thing Pinkie Pie's here to keep you honest, G!

188
00:09:53,247 --> 00:09:58,091
Gilda: (irritated) Okay, Dash, last one to that cloud 
 up there is a gnarly dragon egg. GO!

189
00:09:58,912 --> 00:09:59,093
(whoosh)

190
00:10:00,282 --> 00:10:03,063
(metal bass line)
Gilda: (hostile) I think the high altitude is making you dizzy.

191
00:10:03,626 --> 00:10:08,013
(popping balloons)
Pinkie Pie: Wait! Guys-

192
00:10:08,131 --> 00:10:09,057
(whoosh)

193
00:10:09,071 --> 00:10:10,027
(whoosh)

194
00:10:10,267 --> 00:10:14,035
(bizarre contraption noises)
Pinkie Pie: Oh, wow, you guys 
 almost got away from me that time!

195
00:10:14,354 --> 00:10:17,086
(bizarre contraption noises)

196
00:10:17,086 --> 00:10:21,071
(bizarre contraption noises)
Gilda: So, Dash, got any new moves in your tricktionary,

197
00:10:21,714 --> 00:10:24,013
(bizarre contraption noises)
or are you 100% old school?

198
00:10:24,129 --> 00:10:28,073
(bizarre contraption noises)
Rainbow Dash: New moves?! Hah! Sit back, 
 G, this is gonna take a while.

199
00:10:28,727 --> 00:10:32,021
(metal bass line)
Gilda: Hey Pinkie, c'mere.

200
00:10:32,021 --> 00:10:33,056
Pinkie Pie: Yeah?

201
00:10:33,556 --> 00:10:37,032
(metal bass line)
Gilda: (threatening) Don't you know how 
 to take GET LOST for an answer?!

202
00:10:37,318 --> 00:10:40,015
(metal bass line)
(intimidating) Dash doesn't need to hang with 
 a dweeb like YOU while I'M around.

203
00:10:40,151 --> 00:10:43,012
(metal bass line)
(mocking) You're dorkin' up the skies, Stinky Pie,

204
00:10:43,123 --> 00:10:45,096
(metal bass line)
(threatening) so make like a bee and BUZZ OFF!

205
00:10:45,956 --> 00:10:49,095
(metal bass line)
(Pinkie Pie screaming and spinning)

206
00:10:49,095 --> 00:10:52,009
(metal bass line)

207
00:10:52,086 --> 00:10:56,078
Rainbow Dash: Try matching THAT! ...Hey, where's Pinkie Pie and her crazy contraption?

208
00:10:56,776 --> 00:11:01,047
Gilda: Eh, she left. Something about being... (sardonic) ...as busy as a bee.

209
00:11:02,465 --> 00:11:04,004
(contraption noises winding down, distorted)

210
00:11:04,044 --> 00:11:05,058
(Pinkie Pie "hmphs")

211
00:11:06,552 --> 00:11:11,048
Twilight: So, Pinkie Pie, are you sure that this 
 friend of Rainbow Dash is really so mean?

212
00:11:11,475 --> 00:11:14,072
Pinkie Pie: Um, YEAH! She keeps stealing Rainbow Dash away,

213
00:11:14,725 --> 00:11:17,023
she popped my balloons, and she told me to buzz off!

214
00:11:17,233 --> 00:11:18,081
I've never met a griffon this mean!

215
00:11:18,812 --> 00:11:21,074
Well, actually, I've never met a griffon at 
 all, but I bet if I had,

216
00:11:21,738 --> 00:11:24,025
she wouldn't have been as mean and grumpy as GILDA.

217
00:11:24,246 --> 00:11:26,029
Twilight: You know what I think, Pinkie Pie?

218
00:11:26,289 --> 00:11:29,067
Pinkie Pie: Hmm?
Twilight: (hesitantly) Well, I think...you're jealous.

219
00:11:29,667 --> 00:11:33,090
Pinkie Pie: (incredulous) JEALOUS?!
Spike: Green with envy. Well, in your case, pink with envy.

220
00:11:33,905 --> 00:11:36,018
Twilight: Well, yes. Jealous.

221
00:11:36,181 --> 00:11:38,083
Listen, Pinkie, I don't wanna upset you,

222
00:11:38,828 --> 00:11:40,080
but just because Rainbow Dash has another friend

223
00:11:40,801 --> 00:11:42,020
doesn't make Gilda a grump.

224
00:11:42,195 --> 00:11:46,000
I mean, perhaps it's YOU, Pinkie, who needs to improve her attitude.

225
00:11:46,003 --> 00:11:47,081
Pinkie Pie: Improve MY attitude?!

226
00:11:47,814 --> 00:11:52,078
But I... (stammering) Gilda's a... (stammering) are you seri- (screams)

227
00:11:54,269 --> 00:11:56,064
(door slams, Twilight sighs)

228
00:11:58,263 --> 00:12:00,045
Maybe Twilight is right...

229
00:12:00,446 --> 00:12:03,060
Maybe Gilda isn't a big meany grumpy mean-meany-pants.

230
00:12:03,603 --> 00:12:07,097
Maybe I'm just a big jealous judgmental jealous-jealousy-pants.

231
00:12:07,969 --> 00:12:09,069
(sighs dejectedly)

232
00:12:10,616 --> 00:12:14,038
(slurping)

233
00:12:14,378 --> 00:12:17,007
Gilda: (whoosh, laughs) That was sweet!
(Pinkie's hooves clatter on table)

234
00:12:17,071 --> 00:12:20,079
Rainbow Dash: Uh, I gotta take care of a few weather jobs around here.

235
00:12:20,786 --> 00:12:21,072
Shouldn't take long.

236
00:12:21,715 --> 00:12:23,090
Just, uh, hang out in town and I'll come find ya.

237
00:12:23,898 --> 00:12:26,078
Gilda: That's cool, I guess. (macho) I'm gonna go chow down!

238
00:12:26,777 --> 00:12:27,071
Rainbow Dash: Later!

239
00:12:33,025 --> 00:12:36,062
(screams, shouts feebly) A RATTLER! A RATTLER!

240
00:12:36,622 --> 00:12:40,013
RUN FOR THE HILLS! EVERYBODY FORSAKE YOURSELVES!

241
00:12:40,128 --> 00:12:42,017
(slow, discordant banjo strumming)

242
00:12:43,844 --> 00:12:46,044
This stuff ain't fresh, dude.

243
00:12:47,141 --> 00:12:50,021
(discordant banjo strumming)
Pinkie Pie: Aw, poor Granny Smith! 
 She didn't know it was a joke!

244
00:12:50,206 --> 00:12:53,088
How mean! ...No, no, I can't misjudge her.

245
00:12:53,875 --> 00:12:57,006
(unsure) It was kind of a funny prank...I guess...

246
00:12:58,875 --> 00:13:00,049
(chomps)

247
00:13:01,096 --> 00:13:03,032
(gasps) I DID misjudge her!

248
00:13:03,325 --> 00:13:06,025
She's not only a meany mean-pants, she's also a thief!

249
00:13:07,783 --> 00:13:09,087
...Nononono...she might give it back!

250
00:13:09,873 --> 00:13:11,045
It's just a joke!

251
00:13:11,452 --> 00:13:14,086
Fluttershy: All right, little ones, this way, this way.

252
00:13:14,865 --> 00:13:17,005
Mama duck is free and clear.

253
00:13:18,458 --> 00:13:19,037
Gilda: HEY.

254
00:13:19,037 --> 00:13:22,016
Fluttershy: Please excuse me.
Gilda: (forcefully) I'm WALKIN' here.

255
00:13:22,157 --> 00:13:24,015
Fluttershy: (meekly) Oh, um, I'm sorry...

256
00:13:24,153 --> 00:13:27,087
Fluttershy: I-I was just trying to-
Gilda: (mocking in 
 a whiny voice) I'm sorry! I'm sorry!

257
00:13:27,869 --> 00:13:30,033
(nastily) Why don't you just watch where you're GOING, DOOFUS?!

258
00:13:31,445 --> 00:13:33,007
Fluttershy: (stammering) B-b-b-but I...

259
00:13:34,463 --> 00:13:38,036
(inhales, roars like a lion)

260
00:13:38,364 --> 00:13:42,040
(Fluttershy sobs)

261
00:13:42,404 --> 00:13:46,072
(derisively) Ugh, please. All these lame ponies are driving me buggy.

262
00:13:46,723 --> 00:13:47,093
I gotta bail. (whoosh)

263
00:13:48,906 --> 00:13:52,034
She's a grump AND a thief AND a bully!

264
00:13:52,342 --> 00:13:55,027
The meanest kind of mean meany-pants there is!

265
00:13:55,268 --> 00:13:59,017
I can take it, but NO ONE treats Fluttershy like that!

266
00:13:59,169 --> 00:14:01,003
NO. ONE.

267
00:14:01,027 --> 00:14:05,042
This calls for EXTREME measures! Pinkie Pie style!

268
00:14:10,593 --> 00:14:13,029
(perky) Welcome! Welcome! Welcome!

269
00:14:14,262 --> 00:14:15,093
Applejack: Who's this "Gilda" I've heard nothin' about?

270
00:14:15,934 --> 00:14:20,007
Rarity: I hear she's an old friend of Rainbow Dash. A griffon! So rare.

271
00:14:20,067 --> 00:14:22,034
Twilight: You've met Gilda, right? What's she like?

272
00:14:22,343 --> 00:14:26,034
Fluttershy: Oh! Um, well...I'll tell you later, Twilight.

273
00:14:26,337 --> 00:14:28,057
Pinkie Pie: Welcome! Welcome!

274
00:14:28,566 --> 00:14:31,086
Fluttershy: Um, Pinkie Pie, about this party for Gilda,

275
00:14:31,863 --> 00:14:35,011
Um, do you really think it's a good idea? I mean-

276
00:14:35,114 --> 00:14:38,004
Pinkie Pie: Don't worry your pretty little head about mean old Gilda!

277
00:14:38,039 --> 00:14:40,073
Your Auntie Pinkie Pie has got it aaall taken care of!

278
00:14:41,476 --> 00:14:42,092
Fluttershy: I'm a year older than you.

279
00:14:43,171 --> 00:14:44,015
Pinkie Pie: GILDA!

280
00:14:44,146 --> 00:14:47,054
I'm so honored to throw you one of my signature Pinkie Pie Parties!

281
00:14:47,542 --> 00:14:51,092
And I really, truly, sincerely hope you feel welcome here amongst all us ponyfolk!

282
00:14:53,782 --> 00:14:56,038
(joy buzzer shocks Gilda)

283
00:14:56,383 --> 00:14:58,024
(Gilda crashes to ground)

284
00:14:58,241 --> 00:15:01,031
(ponies laughing)

285
00:15:01,306 --> 00:15:06,069
(Pinkie Pie giggling)
Rainbow Dash: Oh, Pinkie Pie. The 
 ol' hoof-shake buzzer! You are a SCREAM!

286
00:15:06,693 --> 00:15:09,094
Gilda: (chuckles nervously) Yeah, uh, good one, Pinkie Pie.

287
00:15:09,944 --> 00:15:12,068
Rainbow Dash: C'mon G, I'll introduce you to some of my other friends.

288
00:15:12,684 --> 00:15:16,040
Gilda: Right behind you, Dash! (menacingly, under breath) I know what you're up to.

289
00:15:16,399 --> 00:15:18,044
Pinkie Pie: (unfazed) Great!

290
00:15:18,442 --> 00:15:21,000
Gilda: Grrr...I know what you're planning!

291
00:15:20,996 --> 00:15:23,027
Pinkie Pie: (giggles, snorts) Well, I HOPE so!

292
00:15:23,272 --> 00:15:25,069
This wasn't supposed to be a SURPRISE party!

293
00:15:25,687 --> 00:15:29,059
Gilda: I mean, I've got my eye on you.

294
00:15:29,588 --> 00:15:32,075
Pinkie Pie: And I'VE got my eye on YOU!

295
00:15:33,256 --> 00:15:35,044
Everyone, I'd like you all to meet Gilda,

296
00:15:35,439 --> 00:15:37,062
a long-time dear friend of Rainbow Dash.

297
00:15:37,622 --> 00:15:39,090
Let's honor her and welcome her to Ponyville!

298
00:15:39,897 --> 00:15:44,012
(ponies cheer)

299
00:15:44,123 --> 00:15:45,096
Pinkie Pie: Please help yourself!

300
00:15:45,958 --> 00:15:49,084
Gilda: Vanilla lemon drops! Don't mind if I do.

301
00:15:51,879 --> 00:15:52,023
(gulps)

302
00:15:53,945 --> 00:15:57,006
Gilda: (breathes fire, pants) HOOOOT!

303
00:15:57,057 --> 00:15:58,026
Rainbow Dash: G, the punch!

304
00:15:58,264 --> 00:15:59,052
(siren blaring)

305
00:15:59,518 --> 00:16:02,007
(Gilda gasping, gulping)

306
00:16:02,072 --> 00:16:03,042
Huh?!

307
00:16:03,419 --> 00:16:07,092
Pinkie Pie: Well, whaddya know?! Pepper in the vanilla lemon 
 drops, and the punch served in a dribble glass!

308
00:16:07,924 --> 00:16:12,010
Rainbow Dash: Ha! Priceless, priceless! (laughing)

309
00:16:12,103 --> 00:16:14,098
(Gilda gulps water, pants)

310
00:16:14,983 --> 00:16:16,093
(sarcastic) Yeah. Hilarious.

311
00:16:16,933 --> 00:16:19,039
Rainbow Dash: Hey G, look! Presents!

312
00:16:23,342 --> 00:16:27,029
(pop, ponies laugh)

313
00:16:27,289 --> 00:16:31,066
Applejack: Spittin' snakes! Heh, somepony pulled that prank on me last month!

314
00:16:31,655 --> 00:16:34,095
(sardonic) Ha ha. I bet I know who THAT was.

315
00:16:34,952 --> 00:16:36,021
Pinkie Pie: (quizzically) You do?

316
00:16:38,011 --> 00:16:42,001
(ponies chatter)

317
00:16:42,008 --> 00:16:44,003
Pinkie Pie: Cake time, everypony!

318
00:16:44,263 --> 00:16:46,002
Spike: Hey! Can I blow out the candles?

319
00:16:46,214 --> 00:16:48,005
Twilight: Why don't we let Gilda blow out the candles, Spike?

320
00:16:48,489 --> 00:16:50,005
She IS the guest of honor, after all.

321
00:16:50,486 --> 00:16:52,008
(Spike yelps, crashes into wall)
Gilda: EXACTLY.

322
00:16:52,762 --> 00:16:55,005
(inhales sharply, blows)

323
00:16:56,802 --> 00:17:00,005
(inhales sharply, blows)

324
00:17:00,471 --> 00:17:05,000
(ponies laughing)

325
00:17:05,045 --> 00:17:09,005
(ponies laughing)
(Gilda blows repeatedly)

326
00:17:09,048 --> 00:17:14,004
Spike: Relighting birthday candles! I LOVE that prank! What a classic!

327
00:17:14,449 --> 00:17:16,007
Pinkie Pie: Now, I wonder who could've done that?

328
00:17:16,725 --> 00:17:19,000
(metal bass line)
Gilda: (sardonic) Yeah. I wonder.

329
00:17:19,604 --> 00:17:24,000
Spike: (splats into cake) Mm! Who cares, this cake is AMAZING!

330
00:17:23,969 --> 00:17:25,001
Twilight: Spike!

331
00:17:25,084 --> 00:17:27,002
Spike: (mouth full) What? It'sh great! Try shome!

332
00:17:28,149 --> 00:17:30,009
Rainbow Dash: Hey G, you're not upset about some silly candles, are you?

333
00:17:30,935 --> 00:17:35,003
Gilda: (false bravado) No way, Dash! Like I 
 said, I'm down with a good prank.

334
00:17:35,003 --> 00:17:37,003
Rainbow Dash: Come on, then! Let's have some cake.

335
00:17:38,366 --> 00:17:39,009
(Pinkie Pie chomps, whimpers in confusion)

336
00:17:39,875 --> 00:17:43,005
(metal bass line)
Gilda: (threateningly) Hey. I'm watching you. Like a hawk.

337
00:17:43,497 --> 00:17:45,006
Pinkie Pie: (sweetly) Why? Can't you watch me like a griffon?

338
00:17:45,633 --> 00:17:48,004
Applejack: Hey y'all! It's Pin the Tail on the Pony!

339
00:17:48,042 --> 00:17:49,006
Let's play!

340
00:17:49,581 --> 00:17:52,001
Rarity: Oh, my FAVORITE game! Can I go first?!

341
00:17:52,135 --> 00:17:53,004
Can I have the purple tail?

342
00:17:54,318 --> 00:17:56,004
Gilda: (self-importantly) Well, I'M the guest of honor!

343
00:17:56,361 --> 00:17:58,000
And I'LL have the purple tail!

344
00:17:58,033 --> 00:18:00,006
Pinkie Pie: Yeah! Gilda should definitely go first!

345
00:18:00,587 --> 00:18:01,009
Let's get you blindfolded.

346
00:18:01,887 --> 00:18:04,005
Gilda: Hey-what-what're you doing?! Augh!

347
00:18:04,534 --> 00:18:08,002
(Gilda spinning)
Pinkie Pie: We're gonna spin you around and around, 
 and then you pin the tail on the pony!

348
00:18:08,025 --> 00:18:13,000
Pinkie Pie: Now, just walk straight ahead and pin the tail!
Gilda: 
 (mocking) Now, just walk straight ahead and pin the tail!

349
00:18:13,033 --> 00:18:16,002
(sarcastic) Yeah, right. This is another prank, isn't it?

350
00:18:16,214 --> 00:18:19,006
Gilda: I'M goin' this way.
Pinkie Pie: W-Wait...the poster is this w-

351
00:18:19,604 --> 00:18:23,009
(Gilda screaming repeatedly, crashes)

352
00:18:24,898 --> 00:18:28,001
Pinkie Pie: Uh, Gilda? You pinned the tail on the wrong end!

353
00:18:28,083 --> 00:18:31,001
(ponies laugh)

354
00:18:31,125 --> 00:18:34,000
(lion roar)

355
00:18:34,047 --> 00:18:36,007
Gilda: (maliciously) THIS is your idea of a good time?!

356
00:18:36,074 --> 00:18:39,008
I've NEVER met a lamer bunch of dweebs in all my life!

357
00:18:39,759 --> 00:18:41,006
And Pinkie Pie...

358
00:18:41,617 --> 00:18:45,003
YOU are Queen Lame-o with your weak little party pranks,

359
00:18:45,285 --> 00:18:48,002
Do you REALLY think you can make me lose my cool?!

360
00:18:48,165 --> 00:18:53,002
Well, Dash and I have ten TIMES as much 
 cool as the REST of you put together!

361
00:18:53,018 --> 00:18:56,007
Come on, Dash, we're bailing on this PATHETIC scene.

362
00:18:56,071 --> 00:18:59,002
...Come ON, Rainbow Dash!

363
00:18:59,217 --> 00:19:01,003
I SAID, WE'RE LEAVING!

364
00:19:01,261 --> 00:19:06,006
Rainbow Dash: ...Y'know, Gilda? I was the one who set 
 up all those "weak" pranks at this party.

365
00:19:06,555 --> 00:19:08,008
Gilda: (shocked) ...W-what?!

366
00:19:08,784 --> 00:19:12,008
Pinkie Pie: Ooh.
Rainbow Dash: So I guess I'M Queen Lame-o.

367
00:19:12,778 --> 00:19:15,001
Gilda: (nervously) Come on, Dash! You're joshin' me!

368
00:19:15,053 --> 00:19:19,005
Rainbow Dash: They weren't all meant for you specifically. It was 
 just dumb luck that you set them all off!

369
00:19:19,512 --> 00:19:23,006
Pinkie Pie: I shoulda known! That dribble cup 
 had "Rainbow Dash" written all over it!

370
00:19:23,645 --> 00:19:26,009
Gilda: (indignant) No. Way. It was Pinkie Pie!

371
00:19:26,942 --> 00:19:28,008
She set up this party to trip me up,

372
00:19:28,753 --> 00:19:30,003
to make a fool of me!

373
00:19:30,286 --> 00:19:33,005
Pinkie Pie: Me?! I threw this party to improve your attitude!

374
00:19:33,537 --> 00:19:36,008
I thought a good party might turn that frown upside-down!

375
00:19:36,787 --> 00:19:39,005
Rainbow Dash: And you sure didn't need any help making a fool of yourself!

376
00:19:39,527 --> 00:19:43,006
You know, this is not how I thought my 
 OLD friends would treat my NEW friends!

377
00:19:43,614 --> 00:19:50,000
If being cool is all you care about, maybe you 
 should go find some new COOL friend someplace else.

378
00:19:50,023 --> 00:19:51,007
(Gilda growls)

379
00:19:51,695 --> 00:19:54,009
Gilda: (stumbling over words) Yeah?! Well...you....you...

380
00:19:54,852 --> 00:19:57,005
YOU are such a...a FLIP-FLOP!

381
00:19:57,453 --> 00:19:59,008
Cool one minute and lame the next.

382
00:19:59,775 --> 00:20:03,003
When YOU decide not to be lame anymore, gimme a call.

383
00:20:03,304 --> 00:20:06,004
(door slams)
Rainbow Dash: Not. Cool.

384
00:20:06,416 --> 00:20:09,002
Spike: Wow. Talk about a party pooper.

385
00:20:09,156 --> 00:20:13,006
(ponies chatter about Gilda)

386
00:20:13,637 --> 00:20:16,004
Rainbow Dash: I'm sorry, everypony, for bringing Gilda here.

387
00:20:16,424 --> 00:20:18,006
I didn't know how rude she was.

388
00:20:18,056 --> 00:20:23,002
And Pinkie Pie, I'm really sorry she ruined that 
 awesome party you put on for her.

389
00:20:23,025 --> 00:20:26,005
Pinkie Pie: Hey, if you wanna hang out with party poopers, that's your business.

390
00:20:26,455 --> 00:20:28,005
Rainbow Dash: I'd rather hang out with you.

391
00:20:28,498 --> 00:20:31,000
Rainbow Dash: No hard feelings?
Pinkie Pie: No hard feelings.

392
00:20:31,006 --> 00:20:32,009
(joy buzzers shock both)

393
00:20:33,258 --> 00:20:37,004
(ponies laugh)

394
00:20:37,438 --> 00:20:40,005
Twilight: Hey, Pinkie. Sorry I accused you of misjudging Gilda.

395
00:20:40,503 --> 00:20:42,008
Looks like I'm the one who misjudged you.

396
00:20:42,778 --> 00:20:47,001
Pinkie Pie: It's okay, Twilight! Even you can't be 
 a super smart smarty smart-pants all the time!

397
00:20:47,144 --> 00:20:51,002
Come on everypony, there's still a whole lotta party to finish!

398
00:20:51,184 --> 00:20:53,003
(ponies cheer)

399
00:20:53,032 --> 00:20:55,003
Twilight: (voice-over) "Dearest Princess Celestia,

400
00:20:55,271 --> 00:21:01,004
Today I learned that it's hard to accept when somepony you like 
 wants to spend time with somepony who's not so nice.

401
00:21:01,354 --> 00:21:04,007
Though it's impossible to control who your friends hang out with,

402
00:21:04,652 --> 00:21:07,004
it is possible to control your own behavior.

403
00:21:07,438 --> 00:21:09,007
Just continue to be a good friend.

404
00:21:09,714 --> 00:21:14,003
In the end, the difference between a false friend and 
 one who's true will surely come to light.

405
00:21:14,265 --> 00:21:17,000
Your faithful student, Twilight Sparkle."

406
00:21:17,933 --> 00:21:19,008
Princess Celestia: (voice-over) "Dear Twilight Sparkle,

407
00:21:19,837 --> 00:21:21,006
my most faithful student..."

408
00:21:24,528 --> 00:21:27,000
(aloud) Oh! (giggles) Wrong ink!

409
00:21:26,989 --> 00:21:29,004
(sighs, laughs)

410
00:21:30,751 --> 00:21:32,007
(ending theme begins) My Little Pony

411
00:21:35,023 --> 00:21:36,009
My Little Pony

412
00:21:39,156 --> 00:21:48,000
(instrumental)

413
00:21:48,026 --> 00:21:54,009
My Little Pony, friends
