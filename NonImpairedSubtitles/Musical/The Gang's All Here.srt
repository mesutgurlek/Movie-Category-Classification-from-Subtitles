1
00:04:13,019 --> 00:04:15,010
Got any coffee on you?

2
00:04:40,380 --> 00:04:42,541
Oh, yes?

3
00:07:17,036 --> 00:07:19,231
Now I can retire.

4
00:07:19,305 --> 00:07:21,796
Well, there's your
good-neighbor policy.

5
00:07:21,874 --> 00:07:25,901
Come on, honey.
That's good neighborin'. There we are.

6
00:07:30,616 --> 00:07:34,780
And now, ladies and gentlemen,
that international favorite, Tony De Marco.

7
00:07:49,335 --> 00:07:51,496
You never saw a place
like this in your life.

8
00:07:51,571 --> 00:07:53,505
- Hello, kids. There you are.
- Hello.

9
00:07:53,573 --> 00:07:55,541
I'll wait a bit on you
till the other one.

10
00:07:55,608 --> 00:07:57,940
- This place gives me a very uneasy feeling, A.J.
- Shame on you.

11
00:07:58,010 --> 00:08:00,706
- Gimme your hat and get your mind off your wife.
- That hat's all right?

12
00:08:00,780 --> 00:08:02,714
- Yes, your hat's all right.
- That's my hat.

13
00:08:02,782 --> 00:08:04,716
She knows it.
Never lost one in her life.

14
00:08:04,784 --> 00:08:07,344
Now, see here, A.J.
I should have been more fiirm.

15
00:08:07,420 --> 00:08:10,878
When I told you that I am never seen
in places like this, I meant it.

16
00:08:10,957 --> 00:08:14,688
I don't know how you've managed to get me
this far. I should have put my foot down.

17
00:08:14,760 --> 00:08:18,696
- Don't be a square from Delaware.
Get hep to yourself.
- What kind of talk is that?

18
00:08:18,764 --> 00:08:21,324
- I heard it on a jukebox.
- Well, I don't think I like it.

19
00:08:21,400 --> 00:08:24,927
- I have your table, Mr. Mason.
- Thank you, Harvey. Come on, Pottsie.

20
00:08:26,873 --> 00:08:30,206
Hey, Phil, do those two
come here very often?

21
00:08:35,314 --> 00:08:37,248
Well, I haven't seen
the mortician before...

22
00:08:37,316 --> 00:08:39,477
but that old mountain goat
in the blue serge...

23
00:08:39,552 --> 00:08:41,918
comes leaping in here
two or three times a week.

24
00:08:41,988 --> 00:08:44,149
That old mountain goat
happens to be my father.

25
00:08:44,223 --> 00:08:46,521
Well, you see, I like goats.
Lovely animals.

26
00:08:46,592 --> 00:08:49,618
Some of my best friends are-
How about another goat- uh, beer?

27
00:08:49,695 --> 00:08:53,096
No, thanks.
I think I'll horn in on the old goat.

28
00:08:53,165 --> 00:08:55,360
The usual. Lemonades.

29
00:08:55,434 --> 00:08:57,800
- What did you order?
- Lemonade.

30
00:09:02,441 --> 00:09:04,909
How do you like Tony De Marco?
Great, isn't he?

31
00:09:09,649 --> 00:09:13,380
I hope that woman's his wife, because
if she's not, there should be a law.

32
00:09:13,452 --> 00:09:15,920
That's a good one.

33
00:09:15,988 --> 00:09:17,922
Good, eh?

34
00:09:17,990 --> 00:09:20,185
A.J., look.
We have company.

35
00:09:20,259 --> 00:09:23,456
- What are you doing here?
- I was about to ask you the same thing.

36
00:09:23,529 --> 00:09:26,623
Well, we just dropped in
for a nightcap.

37
00:09:26,699 --> 00:09:30,601
- We missed the Westchester train,
and Potter here suggested-
- Nothing of the kind.

38
00:09:30,670 --> 00:09:32,900
- Andy, this is entirely your father's idea.
- What?

39
00:09:32,972 --> 00:09:36,135
- Yes.
- Young man, I thought you had
to get back to your outfiit.

40
00:09:36,208 --> 00:09:39,268
Well, I do, but I didn't say when.
I've got till Monday morning.

41
00:09:39,345 --> 00:09:42,212
How 'bout you?
Mrs. Potter give you a furlough too?

42
00:09:42,281 --> 00:09:45,808
I promised my wife I'd be home before
midnight. I like to keep my promises.

43
00:09:45,885 --> 00:09:48,752
She expects me to,
and I expect her to expect it.

44
00:09:58,097 --> 00:10:00,463
Say, Peyton, supposing I get
Mrs. Potter on the phone...

45
00:10:00,533 --> 00:10:03,297
- and explain that you and Dad just dropped in-
- Go ahead, son.

46
00:10:03,369 --> 00:10:06,998
- She likes Andy, and anything
he tells her will be okay.
- I'll call her, fiix everything.

47
00:10:07,073 --> 00:10:10,270
- You be sure to explain to her
that this is just lemonade.

48
00:10:10,343 --> 00:10:12,971
- Lemonade.
- Lemonade.

49
00:10:14,981 --> 00:10:17,472
And now, folks,
the Club New Yorker proudly presents...

50
00:10:17,550 --> 00:10:20,610
its beautiful dance instructors,
specially imported to teach you...

51
00:10:20,686 --> 00:10:23,780
that brand-new South American
dance sensation, the Uncle Samba.

52
00:10:23,856 --> 00:10:27,314
Our girls don't wait for leap year.
They choose their partners now.

53
00:10:27,393 --> 00:10:29,554
And you don't have to
wait either, gentlemen.

54
00:10:29,629 --> 00:10:31,927
Look around and choose
your nearest exquisite.

55
00:10:31,998 --> 00:10:34,466
All right, girls.
Grab your partners and let's go.

56
00:10:36,268 --> 00:10:38,828
Come on up. That's the idea. There we go.

57
00:10:40,072 --> 00:10:42,006
There you are.

58
00:10:49,081 --> 00:10:52,517
Hello? Hello!

59
00:10:58,090 --> 00:11:00,524
Oh, hello, Andy.
Where are you?

60
00:11:00,593 --> 00:11:04,723
Club New Yorker?
Oh. Potter's with you?

61
00:11:04,797 --> 00:11:08,198
Dad brought him here after the dinner
for a nightcap. Don't worry about him.

62
00:11:08,267 --> 00:11:10,895
Don't give him anything stronger
than lemonade.

63
00:11:10,970 --> 00:11:14,371
The last time he had champagne was
on our honeymoon. It was at Niagara.

64
00:11:14,440 --> 00:11:18,206
He thought he was a barrel. He wanted me
to roll over the falls with him.

65
00:11:18,277 --> 00:11:20,438
I'll look after him.

66
00:11:20,513 --> 00:11:22,447
Is Vivian there?
Put her on.

67
00:11:22,515 --> 00:11:24,983
Hold on. I'll call her.
Oh, Vivian!

68
00:11:25,051 --> 00:11:26,985
- Yes, Blossom.
- Phone, dear.

69
00:11:27,053 --> 00:11:29,044
- Who is it?
- Andy.

70
00:11:29,121 --> 00:11:32,113
Oh. Hello, Andy.

71
00:11:33,726 --> 00:11:35,717
At the Club New Yorker?

72
00:11:35,795 --> 00:11:37,729
He is?

73
00:11:37,797 --> 00:11:40,595
How dare you drag my father
to such a sinful place?

74
00:11:40,666 --> 00:11:42,793
Tell your mother she has
nothing to worry about.

75
00:11:47,306 --> 00:11:51,140
My father, he's doing all right.

76
00:11:56,248 --> 00:11:59,240
Say, that girl's a honey.
Who is she, Ruth?

77
00:11:59,318 --> 00:12:03,880
- That's Eadie Allen, one of our new girls.
- Eadie Allen. Hmm.

78
00:12:30,116 --> 00:12:32,710
Mr. Potter!

79
00:12:44,897 --> 00:12:47,058
This is all your fault, A.J.

80
00:12:47,133 --> 00:12:49,397
It was you who sicced
that gypsy on me.

81
00:12:49,468 --> 00:12:52,460
- She's no gypsy. She's a Brazilian.
- Well, whatever she is, she's a-

82
00:12:52,538 --> 00:12:54,563
- She's a bombshell.
- Bombshell. That's exactly right.

83
00:12:54,640 --> 00:12:58,440
Did you see that man with the camera?
Did you see that thing explode in his hands?

84
00:12:58,511 --> 00:13:02,106
I was lucky to get out alive.
Now I'm gonna be fiirm. We are leaving.

85
00:13:02,181 --> 00:13:04,172
Well, I talked to Mrs. Potter
and everything's fiine.

86
00:13:04,250 --> 00:13:07,447
- She was delighted to hear that
you had taken up dancing again.
- She was?

87
00:13:07,520 --> 00:13:11,047
Did you tell her about me out there
dancing with that South American savage?

88
00:13:11,123 --> 00:13:13,318
I knew I shouldn't have
let you telephone.

89
00:13:13,392 --> 00:13:15,383
I was only joking.
I told her nothing.

90
00:13:15,461 --> 00:13:18,396
What I was doing out there,
that wasn't Peyton Potter at all.

91
00:13:18,464 --> 00:13:21,627
- Now, don't be modest. You were swell.
- Really. I've had enough.

92
00:13:21,700 --> 00:13:24,931
- Mason, if you please.
- Old Pottsie can't take it.

93
00:13:25,004 --> 00:13:27,768
Well, you go along with him.
I've got some unfiinished business.

94
00:13:27,840 --> 00:13:30,434
Unfiinished business?
That must mean a girl.

95
00:13:30,509 --> 00:13:32,534
Boy, I wish I were young again.

96
00:13:32,611 --> 00:13:35,307
- Well, I'm glad you're not. Where would I be?
- Good night, Son.

97
00:13:35,381 --> 00:13:37,315
Good night, Dad.

98
00:13:37,383 --> 00:13:40,716
Oh, waiter.
Take a message to Phil Baker.

99
00:13:40,786 --> 00:13:43,812
- Ask him to meet me at the bar between shows.
- Yes, sir.

100
00:13:45,124 --> 00:13:48,582
And, waiter. Have him
bring Miss Allen with him.

101
00:13:48,661 --> 00:13:51,323
- There you are.
- Yes, sir. Miss Allen.

102
00:13:51,397 --> 00:13:54,924
- You want to see me, Andy?
- Yes, but, well, where's Miss Allen?

103
00:13:55,000 --> 00:13:58,333
Miss Allen? Oh, you see, between shows,
she goes over to the Broadway Canteen.

104
00:13:58,404 --> 00:14:00,338
This is her night
to dance with servicemen.

105
00:14:00,406 --> 00:14:02,897
- Didn't you tell her I wanted to meet her?
- She wasn't interested.

106
00:14:02,975 --> 00:14:04,909
- I'm afraid you picked the wrong girl.
- Yeah?

107
00:14:04,977 --> 00:14:06,945
I think I'll go over
to that Broadway Canteen.

108
00:14:07,012 --> 00:14:10,311
- I'm warning you, you won't get to fiirst base.
- I'm pretty good at baseball.

109
00:14:10,382 --> 00:14:12,543
So was the mighty Casey,
but even Casey struck out.

110
00:14:12,618 --> 00:14:15,314
It'll take more than three strikes
to keep me away from fiirst base.

111
00:14:15,387 --> 00:14:17,651
- Fifty bucks says you go down swinging.
- I'll take that bet.

112
00:17:49,933 --> 00:17:53,528
- Have you ever been in Tennessee?
- No. Is that where y'all from?

113
00:17:53,603 --> 00:17:56,936
- You guessed it. And I bet
I can tell you where you're from.
- Where?

114
00:17:57,007 --> 00:17:58,941
Heaven, lady.
Heaven.

115
00:17:59,009 --> 00:18:00,943
Shove off, sailor.

116
00:18:01,011 --> 00:18:02,945
- So long, angel.
- So long, Tennessee.

117
00:18:03,013 --> 00:18:05,447
- Are you really an angel?
- The navy seems to think so.

118
00:18:05,515 --> 00:18:09,042
My mom always told me, if I was
a good boy, I'd see an angel someday.

119
00:18:09,119 --> 00:18:12,316
You be a good boy now and watch
that right hand. It's slipping.

120
00:18:12,389 --> 00:18:16,120
Just lookin' for your wings, baby.
Lookin' for your wings.

121
00:18:16,192 --> 00:18:20,185
- Do I really have to give you up?
- Sorry, it's the rule here.

122
00:18:20,263 --> 00:18:22,993
The marines lay the groundwork,
and the army takes over.

123
00:18:23,066 --> 00:18:25,500
When I fiirst saw you,
I said, ''target for tonight.''

124
00:18:25,568 --> 00:18:27,502
Hmm. You're not
wearing them, are you?

125
00:18:27,570 --> 00:18:29,834
- Not wearing what?
- Your marksmanship medals.

126
00:18:31,908 --> 00:18:33,899
Ah, I wish you weren't
so beautiful.

127
00:18:33,977 --> 00:18:35,911
Why?

128
00:18:35,979 --> 00:18:40,075
Well, then nobody would cut in, and you'd be
all mine for the rest of the evening.

129
00:18:40,150 --> 00:18:42,710
Have you been getting results
with that line?

130
00:18:43,720 --> 00:18:45,881
Aw, I'm sorry.

131
00:18:45,956 --> 00:18:49,483
You're used to getting a pretty good spiel
from most of these fellas I guess.

132
00:18:49,559 --> 00:18:51,584
Oh, I don't mind them.

133
00:18:51,661 --> 00:18:54,653
After all,
they're a long way from home.

134
00:18:54,731 --> 00:18:57,165
A long way from their girls.

135
00:18:57,233 --> 00:19:00,259
You can't blame them if they get
off the beam once in a while.

136
00:19:00,337 --> 00:19:02,271
They're all pretty sweet.

137
00:19:02,339 --> 00:19:04,773
Even the wise ones.

138
00:19:04,841 --> 00:19:08,504
Say, would you think
I was too forward if I, uh-

139
00:19:08,578 --> 00:19:10,546
If you what?

140
00:19:10,613 --> 00:19:13,138
Well, if I asked you your name?

141
00:19:13,216 --> 00:19:16,413
No, of course not. It's Allen.
What's yours?

142
00:19:16,486 --> 00:19:19,353
- What?
- I said, ''What's your name? ''

143
00:19:19,422 --> 00:19:23,222
Oh. Well, uh, it's, uh, Casey.

144
00:19:23,293 --> 00:19:26,592
Casey? Hmm.
That's a pretty good name.

145
00:19:26,663 --> 00:19:28,927
- ''Casey at the bat.''
- That's me.

146
00:19:28,999 --> 00:19:30,933
- Huh?
- Well, l-

147
00:19:31,001 --> 00:19:33,026
I mean,
I played a lot of baseball.

148
00:19:33,103 --> 00:19:36,163
- Are you pretty good?
- Well, that depends.

149
00:19:36,239 --> 00:19:39,367
Sometimes I, uh,
don't even get to fiirst base.

150
00:19:40,643 --> 00:19:43,942
- I like baseball.
- So do I.

151
00:19:44,014 --> 00:19:46,005
I like dancing too.

152
00:19:47,117 --> 00:19:50,382
- Huh? Oh, I'm sorry.
- That's all right.

153
00:19:57,861 --> 00:19:59,795
Would you like something to eat?

154
00:19:59,863 --> 00:20:02,058
- Why, yes. I guess I would.
- Doughnuts and coffee?

155
00:20:02,132 --> 00:20:05,124
- If you led me to it, I'd eat hay.
- Well, come on.

156
00:20:17,213 --> 00:20:19,238
May I have a couple, June?

157
00:20:20,950 --> 00:20:23,441
Thank you.
There you are.

158
00:20:23,520 --> 00:20:25,818
- Oh, cream and sugar?
- No, thanks.

159
00:20:25,889 --> 00:20:29,325
You'll fiind those awfully good.
You can dunk if you'd like to.

160
00:20:29,392 --> 00:20:31,622
- Dunk?
- Mm-hmm. Like this.

161
00:20:33,897 --> 00:20:35,888
- Isn't that better?
- Yes, much better.

162
00:20:35,965 --> 00:20:37,899
Here. Have another bite.

163
00:20:37,967 --> 00:20:40,265
Couldn't we just talk?
I'm not awfully hungry.

164
00:20:40,336 --> 00:20:42,566
Well, I have to leave pretty soon now.
I've got a show to do.

165
00:20:42,639 --> 00:20:45,233
A show?
Are you an actress?

166
00:20:45,308 --> 00:20:48,607
Well, not exactly.
Just a showgirl from the Club New Yorker.

167
00:20:48,678 --> 00:20:50,646
- A showgirl.
- Mm-hmm.

168
00:20:50,713 --> 00:20:54,046
- Gee, no wonder you're so glamorous.
- Now.

169
00:20:55,218 --> 00:20:59,052
- Say, if I'm not being too forward-
- Yes?

170
00:20:59,122 --> 00:21:01,386
You suppose I could walk
to the club with you?

171
00:21:02,459 --> 00:21:04,450
Or do you have a boyfriend?

172
00:21:04,527 --> 00:21:07,291
I haven't a boyfriend. No.

173
00:21:07,363 --> 00:21:10,196
- But we're not allowed to leave
the canteen with soldiers.
- Oh.

174
00:21:10,266 --> 00:21:12,996
And, uh, now I'm afraid
I'll have to say good night.

175
00:21:13,069 --> 00:21:15,230
- Good night?

176
00:21:18,541 --> 00:21:20,475
Won't I ever see you again?

177
00:21:20,543 --> 00:21:22,477
Well, I'm here
three nights a week.

178
00:21:22,545 --> 00:21:25,275
Yes, but I won't have
another leave for some time.

179
00:21:25,348 --> 00:21:28,340
I'm sorry.
Best of luck, soldier.

180
00:21:28,418 --> 00:21:30,352
Thanks.

181
00:21:30,420 --> 00:21:33,048
- You're sweet.
- Thanks.

182
00:21:55,278 --> 00:21:57,712
Well, looks like
we've reached our objective.

183
00:21:57,780 --> 00:22:00,578
- Good night, Casey.
- I wish you didn't have to go in.

184
00:22:00,650 --> 00:22:02,948
- Good night, soldier.
- Couldn't I meet you after the show?

185
00:22:03,019 --> 00:22:07,046
We could sort of go out and you could
show me the town sort of. Will you?

186
00:22:07,123 --> 00:22:09,216
- I'd love to.
- Really?

187
00:22:09,292 --> 00:22:13,353
I'll be fiinished at 1:30.Just in time
for a drink and dance at the Stork Club.

188
00:22:13,429 --> 00:22:17,559
Then on to El Morocco, then just
a quick look in on Monte Carlo.

189
00:22:17,634 --> 00:22:20,034
After that, we'll go
to Lindy's for a late bite...

190
00:22:20,103 --> 00:22:22,503
and then I know
a swell spot on 52nd Street.

191
00:22:22,572 --> 00:22:24,506
Won't cost you more than $50...

192
00:22:24,574 --> 00:22:27,065
that is, of course,
if you don't tip too heavily.

193
00:22:27,143 --> 00:22:29,077
We're gonna have lots of fun,
Sergeant.

194
00:22:29,145 --> 00:22:31,807
- Those places are pretty expensive, aren't they?
- Yes, they are.

195
00:22:31,881 --> 00:22:35,112
Well, I'm afraid I couldn't afford it,
not on a sergeant's salary.

196
00:22:35,185 --> 00:22:38,518
- Well, then what do you say
we skip the whole thing?
- All right.

197
00:22:38,588 --> 00:22:41,022
- Good night, soldier.
- Good night.

198
00:22:44,494 --> 00:22:46,655
- Casey.
- Yeah?

199
00:22:46,729 --> 00:22:48,993
Would you-Would you like
to see the show?

200
00:22:49,065 --> 00:22:51,625
- Gee, would I!
- I'll fiix it for you out front.

201
00:22:51,701 --> 00:22:54,602
Oh, don't go to all that trouble.
I'll see it from backstage.

202
00:30:21,551 --> 00:30:23,519
- Good night, Ben.
- Good night.

203
00:30:25,588 --> 00:30:27,920
- Good night, Ben.
- Oh, Miss Allen...

204
00:30:27,991 --> 00:30:30,459
I just had a nice talk
with your boyfriend here.

205
00:30:30,527 --> 00:30:32,461
Didn't know
you had a sweetheart.

206
00:30:32,529 --> 00:30:35,965
I, uh- l- I told him we were sweethearts.
I hope you don't mind.

207
00:30:36,032 --> 00:30:38,523
Stop acting like Don Ameche,
and get me a taxi.

208
00:30:38,601 --> 00:30:40,933
- I've got one waiting.
- Thank you.

209
00:30:43,940 --> 00:30:47,535
Let's go over by the rail.

210
00:30:47,610 --> 00:30:50,238
First a taxicab,
then the Staten Island Ferry.

211
00:30:50,313 --> 00:30:52,338
- You certainly can pick 'em.

212
00:30:52,415 --> 00:30:55,248
Well, you see, I thought it was nearer
and really much cheaper than-

213
00:30:55,318 --> 00:30:57,252
Any nightclub in town.

214
00:30:59,322 --> 00:31:02,985
- You know, it is kind of nice
to get out of the city at that.
- I'll say.

215
00:31:03,059 --> 00:31:05,289
- It's beautiful out here, isn't it?
- Mm-hmm.

216
00:31:05,361 --> 00:31:09,388
You're beautiful too, Eadie. I couldn't keep
my eyes off you in that show tonight.

217
00:31:09,465 --> 00:31:12,662
You ought to be the star
instead of just one of the girls.

218
00:31:12,735 --> 00:31:16,000
I won't be for long. Phil promised me
a song in the new show.

219
00:31:16,072 --> 00:31:18,199
Really?
I didn't know you could sing.

220
00:31:18,274 --> 00:31:20,401
- Phil thinks I can.
- He's a swell guy.

221
00:31:20,476 --> 00:31:22,467
You'll like him
when you get to know him.

222
00:31:22,545 --> 00:31:26,106
That sounds as though you're going
to let me come around some more.

223
00:31:26,182 --> 00:31:28,116
- Could be.
- Well, after all...

224
00:31:28,184 --> 00:31:31,381
I suppose I'll have to hear
you sing sometime, won't I?

225
00:31:31,454 --> 00:31:33,422
Yes, I suppose you will.

226
00:31:33,489 --> 00:31:36,458
Well, what are we waiting for?

227
00:31:36,526 --> 00:31:38,494
All right, soldier, you win.

228
00:31:38,561 --> 00:31:40,529
- Ready?

229
00:31:41,531 --> 00:31:43,465
Hear the orchestra?

230
00:31:43,533 --> 00:31:45,626
Yeah.

231
00:31:45,702 --> 00:31:47,727
Where's it coming from?

232
00:31:47,804 --> 00:31:50,705
- Where's your imagination?

233
00:32:46,963 --> 00:32:48,897
Gee, that's swell.

234
00:32:48,965 --> 00:32:51,263
- Did you really like it?
- You bet I did.

235
00:32:52,335 --> 00:32:54,269
- Hey.
- What?

236
00:32:54,337 --> 00:32:56,567
Look over there.

237
00:32:56,639 --> 00:32:58,573
The evening star.

238
00:32:58,641 --> 00:33:00,632
Over your left shoulder too.

239
00:33:02,245 --> 00:33:04,839
That ought to mean something.

240
00:33:04,914 --> 00:33:07,644
Oh, l- I forgot to tell you.

241
00:33:07,717 --> 00:33:10,584
We're gonna have Benny Goodman
and his orchestra in the new show.

242
00:33:10,653 --> 00:33:12,587
- Oh, you are?
- Mm-hmm.

243
00:33:12,655 --> 00:33:14,885
That's fiine.

244
00:33:14,957 --> 00:33:18,484
I'm certainly glad
I met you tonight.

245
00:33:18,561 --> 00:33:22,463
- Why?
- Oh, lots of reasons.

246
00:33:22,532 --> 00:33:24,693
Do me a favor, will you?

247
00:33:24,767 --> 00:33:27,201
Sing that song again.

248
00:33:27,270 --> 00:33:30,330
- Oh, you don't want to hear it again.
- Oh, yes, I do.

249
00:33:30,406 --> 00:33:33,466
- That sounds like an order.
- It is.

250
00:33:33,543 --> 00:33:35,534
Okay, Sergeant.

251
00:34:54,223 --> 00:34:57,386
- Here we are. Wait for me.
- Yes, sir.

252
00:34:57,460 --> 00:35:01,089
- Well?
- Oh, no. I'm gonna take you right up to the door.

253
00:35:02,698 --> 00:35:06,099
- Will I see you tomorrow night?
- I thought you had to go back to camp.

254
00:35:06,169 --> 00:35:09,661
Well, I do, but you'll be at the
Grand Central Station to see me off.

255
00:35:09,739 --> 00:35:11,730
I hadn't thought about it.

256
00:35:12,875 --> 00:35:15,173
You'll think about it now,
won't you?

257
00:35:15,244 --> 00:35:17,178
Uh-huh.

258
00:35:17,246 --> 00:35:21,080
- But you haven't even told me
where you were going.
- Huh?

259
00:35:21,150 --> 00:35:23,175
Well, I mean your camp.
Where is it?

260
00:35:23,252 --> 00:35:26,847
Oh. Oh, well, uh-

261
00:35:26,923 --> 00:35:30,415
- Well, that's a military secret.
- Is it north, east, south or west?

262
00:35:30,493 --> 00:35:32,484
L- I can't tell you that either.

263
00:35:32,562 --> 00:35:34,553
- You see, I've never been there before.
- Oh.

264
00:35:34,630 --> 00:35:38,327
But from what the fellas tell me,
it's really a paradise for soldiers.

265
00:35:38,401 --> 00:35:40,335
- No.
- Yeah.

266
00:35:40,403 --> 00:35:43,133
They say it's warm
and beautiful there.

267
00:35:43,206 --> 00:35:46,266
And at night, even the ocean
sings you to sleep.

268
00:35:48,144 --> 00:35:50,408
And the moon and the stars,
why, they-

269
00:35:50,479 --> 00:35:52,879
- Oh, that's swell.
- Yeah.

270
00:35:52,949 --> 00:35:55,509
You'll be hearing from me
the minute I get there.

271
00:35:57,153 --> 00:35:59,087
My train leaves at 8:00.

272
00:35:59,155 --> 00:36:01,419
I'll meet you at
the information booth at 7:30.

273
00:36:01,490 --> 00:36:04,755
Well, I, uh-
I don't know whether I can make it.

274
00:36:04,827 --> 00:36:07,796
You see, I have a-
I have a rehearsal in-

275
00:36:07,864 --> 00:36:10,833
in the morning,
and I don't know for how long.

276
00:36:12,969 --> 00:36:14,903
Then I promised Mabel...

277
00:36:14,971 --> 00:36:18,429
from there I'd go to Brooklyn
with her to see the Dodgers play.

278
00:36:25,481 --> 00:36:31,442
L- I guess maybe I could miss
seeing the Dodgers.

279
00:36:31,520 --> 00:36:33,511
Won't hurt anything.

280
00:36:42,498 --> 00:36:44,523
- Don't be late.
- I won't.

281
00:36:44,600 --> 00:36:47,831
Remember.
Grand Central Station. 7:30.

282
00:36:47,904 --> 00:36:49,838
I'll be there.

283
00:36:49,906 --> 00:36:51,897
Good night.

284
00:36:54,443 --> 00:36:57,037
- Good night.

285
00:37:17,566 --> 00:37:20,501
Did you have
a good time in town?

286
00:37:20,569 --> 00:37:22,503
Well?

287
00:37:22,571 --> 00:37:26,268
Vivian, I want to tell you
about last night.

288
00:37:26,342 --> 00:37:29,869
- You see, l-
- Andy, you don't have to explain anything to me.

289
00:37:29,946 --> 00:37:32,380
I simply asked you
if you had a good time.

290
00:37:32,448 --> 00:37:35,212
Well, uh, yes, I did.

291
00:37:35,284 --> 00:37:37,252
Well, that's all that matters.

292
00:37:37,320 --> 00:37:39,288
You're a good sport, Vivian.

293
00:37:39,355 --> 00:37:41,289
- But then, you've always been.
- Sure.

294
00:37:41,357 --> 00:37:44,588
- You're a very lucky guy to have a girl like me.
- I know that.

295
00:37:44,660 --> 00:37:47,094
However, don't think
I won't be properly jealous...

296
00:37:47,163 --> 00:37:49,188
if you go cruising around
in that uniform...

297
00:37:49,265 --> 00:37:51,199
and get yourself a sweetheart
in every port.

298
00:37:51,267 --> 00:37:53,201
Oh, I'm a soldier,
not a sailor.

299
00:37:53,269 --> 00:37:55,294
A soldier can get
in deep water too.

300
00:37:55,371 --> 00:37:57,362
Sometimes way over his head.

301
00:38:06,549 --> 00:38:10,542
I wish I could take this pool
of yours back to the camp with me.

302
00:38:10,619 --> 00:38:13,383
- You mean they don't have
a swimming pool for you...

303
00:38:13,456 --> 00:38:16,687
Or a nice man to bring you
tall frosty drinks when you're thirsty?

304
00:38:16,759 --> 00:38:18,693
Good afternoon.
How's the swimming today?

305
00:38:18,761 --> 00:38:20,695
Super, Mrs. Potter.
Simply super.

306
00:38:20,763 --> 00:38:22,697
Well, that's wonderful.
Too wonderful.

307
00:38:22,765 --> 00:38:24,824
- Aren't you going in, Mrs. Potter?
- Oh, mercy, no.

308
00:38:24,900 --> 00:38:27,027
The pool is Vivian's department.

309
00:38:27,103 --> 00:38:29,162
I just have the towel concession.

310
00:38:29,238 --> 00:38:31,672
Please. Don't rush those things
back and forth too much.

311
00:38:31,741 --> 00:38:33,902
These children are here
to swim in the pool.

312
00:38:33,976 --> 00:38:35,967
Yes, madam.

313
00:38:37,780 --> 00:38:41,147
Hello, kiddies.
Have you seen the morning tabloid?

314
00:38:46,255 --> 00:38:49,588
I suppose you'll show this to Dad
right away and be properly outraged.

315
00:38:49,658 --> 00:38:52,923
- Oh, no. I'm saving that until I need it.

316
00:38:52,995 --> 00:38:55,463
Go ahead, Beezy.
Ask her.

317
00:38:55,531 --> 00:38:58,022
- I will. Stop pushing.
- Well, go ahead.

318
00:38:58,100 --> 00:39:01,263
- M-M-Mrs. Potter?
- Yes, my dear. What is it?

319
00:39:01,337 --> 00:39:03,362
W-Would you care to dance,
Mrs. Potter?

320
00:39:03,439 --> 00:39:06,237
Me? Oh, isn't that sweet of you.
Just being polite, of course.

321
00:39:06,308 --> 00:39:08,868
Oh, no, he isn't.
I told him you like to dance.

322
00:39:08,944 --> 00:39:12,072
Oh, I do. I love it.
But he is so young, and I am so-

323
00:39:12,148 --> 00:39:14,946
Well, you know, so-so.
Oh, you embarrass me. Really, you do.

324
00:39:15,017 --> 00:39:18,350
- Oh, go ahead, Mother. Beezy loves to dance.
- Yes, that's what I'm afraid of.

325
00:39:18,421 --> 00:39:21,049
You know, I'm not 16 anymore.
I feel silly.

326
00:39:40,443 --> 00:39:42,434
He wants to play.

327
00:40:39,568 --> 00:40:41,502
Drop that.

328
00:40:41,570 --> 00:40:44,198
Mrs. Potter,
I want to have a talk with you.

329
00:40:44,273 --> 00:40:46,434
Come to my study at once, please.

330
00:40:47,710 --> 00:40:49,735
Pass the ammunition, kiddies.

331
00:40:58,888 --> 00:41:02,221
- You going to write me?
- Are those orders, Sergeant?

332
00:41:02,291 --> 00:41:05,385
- I'm serious, Eadie.
- How serious?

333
00:41:05,461 --> 00:41:08,430
Hearing from you every day would make me
feel that you're marching...

334
00:41:08,497 --> 00:41:11,523
right up there with me
at the head of the column.

335
00:41:12,635 --> 00:41:15,627
And that's where
I want you to be, Eadie.

336
00:41:15,704 --> 00:41:17,968
I will write you, Andy...

337
00:41:18,040 --> 00:41:20,031
every day.

338
00:41:21,644 --> 00:41:24,943
All aboard. Leaving on Track 28.

339
00:41:25,014 --> 00:41:27,073
Westbound Limited.

340
00:41:27,149 --> 00:41:30,414
Chicago, Omaha, Denver...

341
00:41:30,486 --> 00:41:33,387
Salt Lake City, Los Angeles...

342
00:41:33,455 --> 00:41:35,446
and San Francisco.

343
00:41:35,524 --> 00:41:37,458
Westbound. All aboard.

344
00:41:39,528 --> 00:41:42,019
Well, I guess that's me.

345
00:41:43,032 --> 00:41:44,966
Wait a minute, Andy.

346
00:41:45,034 --> 00:41:47,832
- You said you were going to Florida.
- I didn't say that, darling.

347
00:41:47,903 --> 00:41:51,669
Yes, you did. You said you were going
to a camp where it was warm and beautiful.

348
00:41:51,740 --> 00:41:54,300
- But, Eadie, l-
- But I remember every word.

349
00:41:54,376 --> 00:41:56,606
You even said the ocean
would sing you to sleep.

350
00:41:56,679 --> 00:41:59,375
- And the moon and the stars and-
- Well, that's right, darling.

351
00:41:59,448 --> 00:42:01,780
The ocean will sing me to sleep.

352
00:42:01,850 --> 00:42:04,011
And the moon and the stars-

353
00:42:04,086 --> 00:42:06,884
The stars. Remember last night
on the ferryboat?

354
00:42:06,956 --> 00:42:10,084
- Yes.
- Well, look over your left shoulder again, will you?

355
00:42:10,159 --> 00:42:12,423
- No, Andy. No.
- Please? Just for me. Just this once.

356
00:42:12,494 --> 00:42:14,485
Just for good luck. Please.

357
00:42:15,965 --> 00:42:18,229
Andy, you've got-Andy!

358
00:42:19,835 --> 00:42:21,826
Andy!

359
00:42:35,351 --> 00:42:37,581
That's the last time
I'll ever take you anyplace.

360
00:42:37,653 --> 00:42:40,816
- Eadie. Well.
- Fancy seeing you here.

361
00:42:40,889 --> 00:42:43,983
- Yes, isn't it fancy?
- I suppose you came down to meet our train, eh?

362
00:42:44,059 --> 00:42:46,186
Yes, I did,
but I was a little early.

363
00:42:46,262 --> 00:42:49,254
Of course, you couldn't have been seeing
a few soldiers off, by any chance.

364
00:42:49,331 --> 00:42:52,494
A few soldiers?
Only one, I'll bet you. Sergeant Crazy.

365
00:42:52,568 --> 00:42:55,696
It's Casey, Dorita. And what's wrong
with saying good-bye to a soldier?

366
00:42:55,771 --> 00:42:58,763
- Nothing.
- I call it nice works if you can get him.

367
00:42:58,841 --> 00:43:01,071
- Where have you two been?
- To the cleaners.

368
00:43:01,143 --> 00:43:03,509
- The cleaners?
- That's what they call the racetrack.

369
00:43:03,579 --> 00:43:06,377
Dorita's never seen a race,
so I took her out to Empire City.

370
00:43:06,448 --> 00:43:09,417
I thought she ought to meet a few
of the horses she's been supporting.

371
00:43:09,485 --> 00:43:11,783
I've never seen a race myself, Dorita.
Tell me about it.

372
00:43:11,854 --> 00:43:15,483
Okay, I tell you. First you pick
the horses, to win, to place, to show.

373
00:43:15,557 --> 00:43:18,583
Then you buy three tickets.
You sit and hold them like this.

374
00:43:18,661 --> 00:43:20,595
The horse lose.
You tear up the tickets.

375
00:43:20,663 --> 00:43:24,224
Then you pick three more, to win,
place, show. You buy three more tickets.

376
00:43:24,300 --> 00:43:27,963
You hold them.
The horse lose again. You tear them up.

377
00:43:28,037 --> 00:43:30,267
More races, more tickets,
more horse lose.

378
00:43:30,339 --> 00:43:33,308
The day is over and what have you got?
I'll show you.

379
00:43:33,375 --> 00:43:35,843
Hold this for me.
Like this, yes.

380
00:43:35,911 --> 00:43:38,505
Horses.

381
00:43:38,580 --> 00:43:40,571
Well, it looks like
a white Christmas.

382
00:44:10,279 --> 00:44:13,077
A.J., have you seen
the San Francisco newspaper?

383
00:44:13,148 --> 00:44:15,082
Why should I see
the San Francisco newspaper?

384
00:44:15,150 --> 00:44:17,084
Well, my secretary's hometown
is San Francisco...

385
00:44:17,152 --> 00:44:19,279
and she gets the San Francisco
newspaper every day.

386
00:44:19,355 --> 00:44:22,017
- What's that got to do with me?
- Don't be stupid, old boy.

387
00:44:22,091 --> 00:44:24,582
If it weren't her hometown,
she wouldn't get the paper, would she?

388
00:44:24,660 --> 00:44:27,857
And I wouldn't be able to show you
this picture of your son receiving a medal.

389
00:44:27,930 --> 00:44:31,627
So what? What?

390
00:44:31,700 --> 00:44:34,567
Well, why didn't you say so
in the fiirst place?

391
00:44:36,338 --> 00:44:39,041
Look at that. Been in the South Pacifiic
three months and already a hero.

392
00:44:39,041 --> 00:44:40,770
Look at that. Been in the South Pacifiic
three months and already a hero.

393
00:44:40,842 --> 00:44:45,176
Why wasn't I told about this? Why didn't
Andy write me? Where's my mail, Miss Custer?

394
00:44:45,247 --> 00:44:47,772
- Right there before you, Mr. Mason.
- Oh, so it is.

395
00:44:47,849 --> 00:44:50,716
- Why were you keeping this from me?
- Why, that's a medal.

396
00:44:50,786 --> 00:44:53,584
- It's a medal.
- Why, it's the same one as in the picture.

397
00:44:53,655 --> 00:44:56,419
It's the same one, on a ribbon
and everything. Isn't that handsome?

398
00:44:56,491 --> 00:44:58,425
- Look at that.
- Oh! He's in San Francisco.

399
00:44:58,493 --> 00:45:00,427
- No.
- Be home in about two weeks.

400
00:45:00,495 --> 00:45:04,932
- No.
- Pottsie! My son back on American soil and a hero.

401
00:45:05,000 --> 00:45:06,934
- Oh!
- Please.

402
00:45:07,002 --> 00:45:10,335
- I tell you, we've got to get busy
and make some plans.
- We certainly have.

403
00:45:10,405 --> 00:45:13,636
Why not another stag dinner?
I had a very good time at that last one.

404
00:45:13,708 --> 00:45:17,109
No, no. Right here.
Behind his name, he signs ''N.S.D.''

405
00:45:17,179 --> 00:45:19,773
Yes, National Selective Draft.
You see, that's what that-

406
00:45:19,848 --> 00:45:23,909
National Selective nothing.
It's N.S.D. No stag dinners.

407
00:45:23,985 --> 00:45:27,819
No stag dinner, yes. Well, then a quiet
little party at home. Just the two families.

408
00:45:27,889 --> 00:45:29,914
He don't want
a quiet little dinner.

409
00:45:29,991 --> 00:45:31,982
He's young.
He wants excitement.

410
00:45:32,060 --> 00:45:35,223
Why, he wants wine, girls, song!

411
00:45:35,297 --> 00:45:38,528
Yes, well, there's the community
sing every Thursday night. It's really-

412
00:45:38,600 --> 00:45:40,761
Oh, that's so stupid,
the choir.

413
00:45:40,836 --> 00:45:44,169
I know what it is. His favorite spot.
The Club New Yorker.

414
00:45:44,239 --> 00:45:47,436
Oh. Well, that lets me out.
Of course, he's your son. If you want-

415
00:45:47,509 --> 00:45:49,943
Wait a minute, Pottsie.
I'm tied up with this board meeting...

416
00:45:50,011 --> 00:45:53,708
but you go right over to the Club New Yorker
now and make arrangements for a party.

417
00:45:53,782 --> 00:45:57,582
What are you talking about? I go to a place
like that in broad daylight and by myself?

418
00:45:57,652 --> 00:46:00,348
Oh, never mind. Now, come on.
Come on. I'll go with you.

419
00:46:00,422 --> 00:46:03,152
Miss Custer,
cancel my next appointment.

420
00:46:09,531 --> 00:46:11,556
Where did you think
you were goin'?

421
00:46:13,034 --> 00:46:16,902
Come on, girls. Snap into it.
Put some life into it.

422
00:46:16,972 --> 00:46:18,963
Close it in. Come on.

423
00:46:19,975 --> 00:46:23,138
Watch your feet.
Up! That's it.

424
00:46:23,211 --> 00:46:26,647
Lines. Now travel forward.
Come on. Forward. Travel!

425
00:46:26,715 --> 00:46:30,845
Oh, kind of ragged, girls. Benson, I want you
to set a new routine for this opening.

426
00:46:30,919 --> 00:46:32,853
- Come on, Pottsie.
- Oh, A.J. -

427
00:46:32,921 --> 00:46:36,448
If you're scared, hold my hand.
Mr. Baker, you remember me, Andy's father.

428
00:46:36,525 --> 00:46:38,459
- Yes, indeed.
- My partner, Mr. Potter.

429
00:46:38,527 --> 00:46:41,291
- Hello. And how's the sergeant?
- Well, if you're referring to my son...

430
00:46:41,363 --> 00:46:43,627
he's back from the Pacifiic
and covered with medals.

431
00:46:43,698 --> 00:46:46,326
Really? How do you like that?
Andy Mason a hero.

432
00:46:46,401 --> 00:46:48,767
And that's why we're here.
He'll be home in a couple of weeks...

433
00:46:48,837 --> 00:46:51,305
and I want to arrange
a party for him here.

434
00:46:51,373 --> 00:46:53,398
That'll be fiine.
Only, the club is closed.

435
00:46:53,475 --> 00:46:56,035
- We're rehearsing a new show to open in October.
- Oh, really?

436
00:46:56,111 --> 00:47:00,070
In that case, Mason, I'm sure Mr. Barker here
must be very busy with his chorus girls-

437
00:47:00,148 --> 00:47:02,082
- Now, wait a minute.
- What's the matter?

438
00:47:02,150 --> 00:47:04,277
- I've got an idea.
- It's too late, old boy.

439
00:47:04,352 --> 00:47:06,616
- This time it's a real killer diller.
- A what?

440
00:47:06,688 --> 00:47:09,316
Jukebox. Why don't you bring
your show up to my place?

441
00:47:09,391 --> 00:47:11,552
That is a ridiculous idea.
You're not well, A.J.

442
00:47:11,626 --> 00:47:14,322
And it's the air in here.
I know. It's this fresh paint.

443
00:47:14,396 --> 00:47:18,662
- Look, you can rehearse it there
and present it at Oakwood.
- Oakwood? That's my place.

444
00:47:18,733 --> 00:47:20,667
- Of course.
- What are you talking about?

445
00:47:20,735 --> 00:47:23,101
That enormous terrace garden
on the south slope.

446
00:47:23,171 --> 00:47:26,732
We could put tables on the terrace
and stage the show in the rose garden.

447
00:47:26,808 --> 00:47:30,175
In my rose garden? I won't hear of such
a thing. Those are my prize yellow roses.

448
00:47:30,245 --> 00:47:33,112
We'll put the show on
to sell war bonds.

449
00:47:33,181 --> 00:47:36,378
We'll make it the biggest
bond-selling drive you ever saw.

450
00:47:36,451 --> 00:47:40,319
We'll charge our neighbors
$5,000 bonds for admission.

451
00:47:40,388 --> 00:47:42,481
Why, we'll raise a million dollars...

452
00:47:42,557 --> 00:47:46,618
which would go to help Andy Mason
and millions like him to get the stuff they need.

453
00:47:46,695 --> 00:47:48,959
Mr. Mason, if you had a beard,
you'd remind me...

454
00:47:49,030 --> 00:47:51,294
of my two favorite people-
Santa Claus and Uncle Sam.

455
00:47:51,366 --> 00:47:54,335
Well, we'll consider everything settled.

456
00:47:54,402 --> 00:47:56,563
You bring your whole troupe
up for a week.

457
00:47:56,638 --> 00:48:00,005
We got plenty of room for everybody,
two houses. Bring 'em up for two weeks.

458
00:48:00,075 --> 00:48:03,238
- Oh, be sensible. Actors for two weeks?
You couldn't feed 'em.
- Oh, now, now.

459
00:48:03,311 --> 00:48:05,836
- You couldn't feed them.
- We haven't got time to be sensible.

460
00:48:05,914 --> 00:48:08,781
I'll call you back later this afternoon
and give you the details.

461
00:48:08,850 --> 00:48:10,818
- Great.
- Oh, by the way...

462
00:48:10,885 --> 00:48:14,218
do you think the Brazilian bombshell
will like the idea?

463
00:48:14,289 --> 00:48:18,555
Well, I don't know. Why don't you
ask her yourself? Here she comes now.

464
00:48:18,627 --> 00:48:22,358
How do you like my new costume?
You think it'll knock their feet off, huh?

465
00:48:22,430 --> 00:48:25,797
Sensational. Oh, Dorita, you remember
Mr. Potter and Mr. Mason.

466
00:48:27,869 --> 00:48:31,100
I remember Mr. Potty. You are here
to kick up some more heels, huh?

467
00:48:31,172 --> 00:48:34,039
- No.
- Mr. Potter wants you to come
to his house this weekend.

468
00:48:34,109 --> 00:48:36,737
Ah-ah, you naughty boy.

469
00:48:36,811 --> 00:48:39,780
You are what they call a fast-work man, yes?

470
00:48:39,848 --> 00:48:42,316
- Mason, please.
- Well, it was really my idea.

471
00:48:42,384 --> 00:48:44,818
We wanted you to come
and help sell war bonds.

472
00:48:44,886 --> 00:48:48,549
Oh. You know, I like you both.
I think you are very cute.

473
00:48:48,623 --> 00:48:51,285
Phil, we're ready for Eadie Allen's number.

474
00:48:51,359 --> 00:48:55,420
Okay. Why don't you boys watch the rehearsal?
I want to see what you think of it.

475
00:48:55,497 --> 00:48:57,624
- Okay, Benny, here we go.
- All right, Phil.

476
00:48:57,699 --> 00:48:59,633
What do you say?
How about it, Eadie?

477
00:48:59,701 --> 00:49:02,727
- I'm all ready, Phil.
- All right, boys, hit the lights.

478
00:49:02,804 --> 00:49:05,864
Come on, girls.
Clear the stage, everyone. Hit it, Benny.

479
00:49:05,940 --> 00:49:09,444
- Wait till you hear her sing this song. It's a lulu.

480
00:54:06,340 --> 00:54:08,274
Where'd you get
all these station wagons?

481
00:54:08,342 --> 00:54:11,743
Commandeered them from the neighbors.
I'm chairman of the transportation committee.

482
00:54:11,812 --> 00:54:15,976
With Mr. Mason's $5,000 war bond admission,
reservations are pouring in.

483
00:54:16,049 --> 00:54:19,746
And at $200 a table, looks like
a real sellout for the army and the navy.

484
00:54:19,820 --> 00:54:22,880
- Say, that's wonderful.
- Did you ever saw so much flowers...

485
00:54:22,956 --> 00:54:24,890
and trees and shrubbers?

486
00:54:24,958 --> 00:54:28,826
- Very nice, Dorita. Very nice.
- What are you do up in the dumps?

487
00:54:28,896 --> 00:54:32,297
Eadie is worried because she thinks
a certain soldier may be back from overseas.

488
00:54:32,366 --> 00:54:34,960
Why shouldn't I worry?
He'll never fiind me out here.

489
00:54:35,035 --> 00:54:38,436
The club is closed, I've left my apartment.
He won't know where I am.

490
00:54:38,505 --> 00:54:40,439
I know exactly
how you feel, Eadie.

491
00:54:40,507 --> 00:54:43,135
I have a soldier too.
He lives right next door.

492
00:54:43,210 --> 00:54:46,111
Andy Mason, Jr.
Maybe you know him.

493
00:54:46,180 --> 00:54:49,980
- Andy Mason, Jr? Why, I know him well.
- You do?

494
00:54:50,050 --> 00:54:53,781
Say, you're not by any chance
engaged to him, are you?

495
00:54:53,854 --> 00:54:57,722
Well, sort of. We've been sweethearts
since I was 10 and he was 12.

496
00:54:57,791 --> 00:55:00,089
- Andy's just back from Australia.
- Australia?

497
00:55:00,160 --> 00:55:02,526
- Casey was in Australia.
- Really?

498
00:55:02,596 --> 00:55:04,791
Wouldn't it be funny
if they knew each other?

499
00:55:04,865 --> 00:55:08,494
Yes, wouldn't it?

500
00:55:41,368 --> 00:55:44,860
Mr. And Mrs. Potter, I want you
to meet Benny Goodman and his boys.

501
00:55:44,938 --> 00:55:47,873
- How do you do, Benny Goodman and boys?
- How do you do?

502
00:55:47,941 --> 00:55:50,205
Go in the house.
You'll fiind everything you need.

503
00:55:50,277 --> 00:55:53,110
- Walter and Edward will take care of you.
- Thank you.

504
00:55:53,180 --> 00:55:55,740
Just make yourselves
at home, boys and girls.

505
00:55:55,816 --> 00:56:00,344
Mother, this is Eadie Allen and Dorita.
I think you've met Mr. Mason.

506
00:56:00,420 --> 00:56:03,150
- Hello.
- Welcome to Oakwood, my dears.

507
00:56:03,223 --> 00:56:05,214
- We're so pleased.
- Thank you.

508
00:56:05,292 --> 00:56:09,854
Ah, I remember you from your pictures
in the newspapers, or was it the police gazette?

509
00:56:09,930 --> 00:56:12,490
- How are you?
- I'm very well to do. Thank you.

510
00:56:12,566 --> 00:56:15,126
Ah, you do very well
what you do do.

511
00:56:15,202 --> 00:56:19,696
Now you young ladies will have
the Magnolia Room. That is the room
next to my daughter's.

512
00:56:19,773 --> 00:56:21,707
- I'll show you up.

513
00:56:21,775 --> 00:56:25,370
- I'm going to like here.

514
00:56:25,445 --> 00:56:29,006
That hat. I'll have to watch
my bell cords and lampshades.

515
00:56:29,249 --> 00:56:30,944
Oh, Phil.

516
00:56:31,018 --> 00:56:34,078
- Hello, Mr. Mason.
- Mrs. Potter, I want you to meet Phil Baker.

517
00:56:34,154 --> 00:56:36,145
How do you do, Mrs. Potter?

518
00:56:36,223 --> 00:56:38,316
This is a great pleasure,
Mr. Baker.

519
00:56:38,392 --> 00:56:41,759
I've heard so much about you,
from young Andrew especially.

520
00:56:41,828 --> 00:56:44,729
I'm so happy to have you with us.
So happy.

521
00:56:44,798 --> 00:56:47,164
I'm so happy
to be here, Mrs. Potter.

522
00:56:47,234 --> 00:56:51,068
It's lovely of you to arrange this holiday
for my hardworking little troupe.

523
00:56:51,138 --> 00:56:54,107
- So very lovely.
- Oh, it's nothing at all, really.

524
00:56:54,174 --> 00:56:58,975
I'll leave you two to get acquainted while
I see that the boys fiind their proper rooms.

525
00:57:03,317 --> 00:57:05,251
- Blossom!
- Philsy!

526
00:57:05,319 --> 00:57:08,049
Blossom, you old cabbage, you.

527
00:57:08,121 --> 00:57:11,215
Oh, boy, it's more
like coleslaw now.

528
00:57:11,291 --> 00:57:13,225
Oh, you haven't changed a bit.

529
00:57:13,293 --> 00:57:15,227
I wish I could say
the same for you.

530
00:57:15,295 --> 00:57:18,196
- You could if you'd lie a little too.
- Do you remember Paris?

531
00:57:18,265 --> 00:57:20,199
- Do I?
- Ah, Paris.

532
00:57:20,267 --> 00:57:23,759
- Paris in the '20s.
- Oh, boy, were you a sensation
with that accordion.

533
00:57:23,837 --> 00:57:26,305
And you with your silver soprano.
What a set of pipes.

534
00:57:26,373 --> 00:57:30,742
Ah, the pipes are not what they used to be.
They're a little corroded right now.

535
00:57:30,811 --> 00:57:35,271
Phil, if anybody in Westchester ever dreamed
that I was once on the stage and in Paris-

536
00:57:35,349 --> 00:57:38,250
Scandalous. Do you remember
the Count de Grace?

537
00:57:38,318 --> 00:57:42,516
How could I ever forget him?
He used to call me his ''long-stem Blossom.''

538
00:57:42,589 --> 00:57:45,149
Well, what the countess called you
made international headlines.

539
00:57:45,225 --> 00:57:48,319
- That was the night of the Beaux Arts Ball.
- You and I took over the show.

540
00:57:48,395 --> 00:57:50,955
- Do you remember that Apache dance we did?
- Do I?

541
00:58:13,120 --> 00:58:15,611
You sure it was in the '20s?

542
00:58:15,689 --> 00:58:18,658
I'm positive it was in the '20s.
It was in the '20s, wasn't it?

543
00:58:18,725 --> 00:58:20,659
Mrs. Potter!

544
00:58:20,727 --> 00:58:23,355
Oh, Peytie. I was just
welcoming Mr. Baker to Oakwood.

545
00:58:23,430 --> 00:58:25,364
- Mr. Baker, Mr. Potter.
- How do you do, Mr. Potter?

546
00:58:25,432 --> 00:58:27,366
I had no idea
he was that welcome.

547
00:58:27,434 --> 00:58:29,561
How welcome would you say
I was in round numbers?

548
00:58:29,636 --> 00:58:32,264
The rest of the theatrical people
are having refreshments on the terrace.

549
00:58:32,339 --> 00:58:35,433
- Possibly you'd like to join them.
- You left your motor running.

550
00:58:35,509 --> 00:58:38,535
He's a sweetheart. I'll bet
he'd give away his last pint of blood.

551
00:58:38,612 --> 00:58:40,603
In fact, I think he has.

552
00:58:40,681 --> 00:58:44,617
I absolutely forbid you getting within
20 feet of that man again. You understand?

553
00:58:44,685 --> 00:58:48,018
- Peytie, wouldn't you settle for 10?
- Well, 15 at the most.

554
00:58:48,088 --> 00:58:50,989
Peytie, can I help it
if I'm irresistible?

555
00:58:51,058 --> 00:58:54,960
It's that vitamin B1. I told you you were
taking too much. You're overdoing it.

556
00:58:55,028 --> 00:58:56,791
- Peytie-
- I don't care to discuss the matter at all.

557
00:58:57,431 --> 00:59:01,026
- All right, Cap, hook her up.
- Give me the slack.

558
00:59:16,316 --> 00:59:19,808
- I love that melody.
- That's the music for Tony De Marco
and Maria's dance.

559
00:59:19,886 --> 00:59:21,877
Where are they?
Oh, Tony! Maria!

560
00:59:21,955 --> 00:59:23,889
Don't look now,
but here comes half of them.

561
00:59:23,957 --> 00:59:26,118
Don't tell me
they've been rationed too.

562
00:59:26,193 --> 00:59:28,923
- I know, but what are you gonna do?

563
00:59:31,364 --> 00:59:34,162
If you don't cut that out,
the censors will. What's he saying?

564
00:59:34,234 --> 00:59:36,896
He wants to know why you didn't tell him
he had to dance in a rose garden.

565
00:59:36,970 --> 00:59:39,905
- What's that got to do with it?
- They're Mr. Potter's roses and he's fond of them.

566
00:59:39,973 --> 00:59:42,999
But he says you don't realize
what your fiiendish little roses have done.

567
00:59:43,076 --> 00:59:45,010
- What have they done?

568
00:59:48,014 --> 00:59:50,505
- No.

569
00:59:50,584 --> 00:59:52,518
- What'd he say?
- How should I know?

570
00:59:52,586 --> 00:59:54,850
They had to send his partner
back to New York with rose fever.

571
00:59:54,921 --> 00:59:57,981
- She doesn't like roses, so Tony hates them.
- Is that so?

572
00:59:58,058 --> 01:00:00,993
Where is he? There you are.
My roses aren't too fond of you.

573
01:00:01,061 --> 01:00:03,928
- What have you got to say to that?

574
01:00:03,997 --> 01:00:07,125
He says he's gonna sue you
and your roses for ruining his partner's health.

575
01:00:07,200 --> 01:00:08,792
- Sue me?
- S!

576
01:00:08,869 --> 01:00:10,803
This is an outrage! Where's Mason?
He got me into this.

577
01:00:10,871 --> 01:00:14,034
I'm gonna have you and your theatrical troupe
thrown off this place forcibly.

578
01:00:14,107 --> 01:00:16,200
- Mason! Mason!
- Oh, Mr. Potter! Mr. Potter!

579
01:00:16,276 --> 01:00:18,244
Let him go.
Mason will cool him off.

580
01:00:18,311 --> 01:00:20,609
What happens to me they wouldn't believe
on the Goodwill Hour.

581
01:00:20,680 --> 01:00:23,240
- Eadie, tell Tony he'll have
to get another dancing partner.
- Another partner?

582
01:00:23,316 --> 01:00:24,908
- Yes.
- But who?

583
01:00:24,985 --> 01:00:26,919
- That's his worry.
- Okay.

584
01:00:33,226 --> 01:00:35,660
I'll stay as I am.

585
01:00:35,729 --> 01:00:38,254
- Tony!

586
01:00:38,331 --> 01:00:40,526
Tony!

587
01:00:44,404 --> 01:00:46,736
I'm sorry.
I've never seen him-

588
01:00:58,084 --> 01:01:00,917
- You are beautiful!
- He speaks English.

589
01:01:00,987 --> 01:01:03,182
It's wolf talk.
That's international.

590
01:01:19,873 --> 01:01:22,501
Say, Vivian's all right.
She catches on pretty quick.

591
01:01:22,576 --> 01:01:25,272
Well, I taught her a few steps
when her father wasn't around.

592
01:01:25,345 --> 01:01:28,314
I might have known. Mrs. Potter
was a great dancer herself in her day.

593
01:01:28,381 --> 01:01:30,713
- Really?
- She was so smooth, she could waltz around...

594
01:01:30,784 --> 01:01:33,582
with a glass of beer on her bustle
and never disturb the foam.

595
01:01:33,653 --> 01:01:37,714
- I guess Vivian takes after her.
- A block off the old chip, huh?

596
01:02:21,001 --> 01:02:24,437
That was thrilling, darling.

597
01:02:24,571 --> 01:02:27,506
I think you danced beautifully.

598
01:02:29,876 --> 01:02:32,436
Baby, you were great.
I want you in the show.

599
01:02:32,512 --> 01:02:35,845
Thank you, Mr. Baker, but I'm afraid of Dad.
He'd never approve of it.

600
01:02:35,916 --> 01:02:38,510
- Why not?
- You know how he feels
about shows and show people.

601
01:02:38,585 --> 01:02:41,554
- My purple past, remember?
- Vivian's gonna be in this show.

602
01:02:41,621 --> 01:02:43,555
Oh, Peyton will never allow it.

603
01:02:43,623 --> 01:02:46,251
- Not even with some gentle persuasion?
- What do you mean?

604
01:02:46,326 --> 01:02:49,784
- Let's see. I've got it. Your boudoir.
- What are you talking about?

605
01:02:49,863 --> 01:02:51,956
I'm talking about the biggest scene
of your career.

606
01:02:52,032 --> 01:02:54,193
Come along,
you old tenderized ham.

607
01:02:54,267 --> 01:02:56,360
Well, at last,
I'm worth something.

608
01:02:57,804 --> 01:03:00,398
- You know what to do now?
- No, my mama never told me.

609
01:03:00,473 --> 01:03:02,941
- Don't you worry about me.

610
01:03:03,009 --> 01:03:04,977
- Here he is.
- Come on, baby. Do your stuff.

611
01:03:05,045 --> 01:03:07,570
- Come in. Oh, Peyton.
- You sent for me, dear?

612
01:03:07,647 --> 01:03:09,979
- Yes, I did.
- What's Mr. Barlow doing here?

613
01:03:10,050 --> 01:03:14,009
- Protect me. This man is blackmailing us.
- Blackmail?

614
01:03:14,087 --> 01:03:17,113
- What's he want, money?
- Would it were money he wanted.

615
01:03:17,190 --> 01:03:19,988
- What do you mean by that?
- He threatens me unless I allow my daughter-

616
01:03:20,060 --> 01:03:23,461
your daughter- our daughter to dance
in the show with Tony De Marco.

617
01:03:23,530 --> 01:03:25,464
Why, that's unthinkable!

618
01:03:25,532 --> 01:03:28,365
Oh, you blackguard.
Oh, you gangster.

619
01:03:28,435 --> 01:03:31,131
How could you think
of such a fiiendish scheme?

620
01:03:31,204 --> 01:03:34,605
Now, Mr. Potter, the only decision
I want you to make is this.

621
01:03:34,674 --> 01:03:38,440
Shall I introduce Vivian as the charming child
of Mr. And Mrs. Peyton Potter...

622
01:03:38,511 --> 01:03:41,378
or shall I simply announce,
ladies and gentlemen...

623
01:03:41,448 --> 01:03:45,976
- I give you the talented daughter
of the notorious Blossom Murphy?

624
01:03:46,052 --> 01:03:49,283
You know her name?
You told him your name?

625
01:03:49,356 --> 01:03:52,052
- No, Peyton, he knew me in Paris.
- In Paris?

626
01:03:52,125 --> 01:03:56,755
You scoundrel! Out of her dark past
which she has lived down so beautifully...

627
01:03:56,830 --> 01:03:59,458
so gracefully, you come at a time
like this to blackmail her.

628
01:03:59,532 --> 01:04:01,466
Ugly word, ''blackmail.''
Don't say it again.

629
01:04:01,534 --> 01:04:03,468
Blackmail, blackmail,
blackmail!

630
01:04:03,536 --> 01:04:05,470
- How much money does he want?
- I don't know.

631
01:04:05,538 --> 01:04:08,769
As I said before,
you cannot bribe me with gold.

632
01:04:08,842 --> 01:04:10,605
It is the artistry
that was Blossom Murphy...

633
01:04:10,677 --> 01:04:12,941
that I would restore to the world
through her daughter Vivian.

634
01:04:13,013 --> 01:04:16,972
Oh, Peyton, you won't make her do it!
You won't make her appear in that show!

635
01:04:17,050 --> 01:04:19,075
- I would die!
- I see no other way out, darling.

636
01:04:19,152 --> 01:04:21,086
Mr. Bailey has us in his power.

637
01:04:21,154 --> 01:04:24,317
- Will you give your consent, Mrs. Potter?
- If Mr. Potter insists!

638
01:04:24,391 --> 01:04:27,417
What else can I do?
But I'm not fiinished with you yet.

639
01:04:27,494 --> 01:04:30,952
I'll see a good lawyer today
to deal with you for this outrage.

640
01:04:31,031 --> 01:04:34,296
- My brother in Brooklyn,
he's a wiz on blackmail cases.
- Oh, is he?

641
01:04:34,367 --> 01:04:36,597
- Yes.
- Really!

642
01:04:40,306 --> 01:04:43,275
- Dorita, come in. I've got a surprise for you.
- What surprise?

643
01:04:43,343 --> 01:04:47,211
- What was it?
- Dad's given his consent. I can appear in the show.

644
01:04:47,280 --> 01:04:49,748
Marvelous!
Then everything's donkey-dory, huh?

645
01:04:49,816 --> 01:04:51,750
- What you got there?
- Sergeant Mason.

646
01:04:51,818 --> 01:04:56,881
- You like him?
- Sergeant Mason? He's Sergeant Crazy!

647
01:04:56,956 --> 01:04:59,151
I think it's you that's crazy.

648
01:04:59,225 --> 01:05:01,523
Oh, no, no, I'm not crazy.
My name is Dorita.

649
01:05:01,594 --> 01:05:04,188
- This is the man I'm going to marry.
- What?

650
01:05:04,264 --> 01:05:07,461
Then he's a two-time,
double-cross snake in the bush.

651
01:05:07,534 --> 01:05:09,468
- Dorita.
- Yes?

652
01:05:09,536 --> 01:05:12,699
- Are you the woman?
- Of course I'm a woman. Do I look like a man?

653
01:05:12,772 --> 01:05:14,763
You don't understand.
You see...

654
01:05:14,841 --> 01:05:17,469
I think there was someone he was playing
around with in town.

655
01:05:17,544 --> 01:05:21,071
Look, nobody play around me,
in town, in cities, nowhere.

656
01:05:22,715 --> 01:05:24,876
I thought you recognized
this picture.

657
01:05:24,951 --> 01:05:27,943
At fiirst minute, yes.
But the second minute, no.

658
01:05:28,021 --> 01:05:30,956
It was somebody else who looked
just like him, like twin sisters.

659
01:05:31,024 --> 01:05:32,958
Same eyes, same hair,
same mouth.

660
01:05:33,026 --> 01:05:35,324
- You were telling the truth?
- Scratch my heart.

661
01:05:35,395 --> 01:05:37,329
Vivian, are you in?

662
01:05:37,397 --> 01:05:40,730
- Oh, it's Eadie!
- What about it? Does that frighten you?

663
01:05:40,800 --> 01:05:43,963
No, I'm cold as a cucumber.

664
01:05:46,573 --> 01:05:49,041
- Come in, Eadie.
- I just heard the good news.

665
01:05:49,109 --> 01:05:51,600
Phil's little blackmail party
really paid off.

666
01:05:51,678 --> 01:05:53,646
Isn't it wonderful?
I've always wanted to dance.

667
01:05:53,713 --> 01:05:56,682
- Tony's very excited about you.
- Oh, I'm glad.

668
01:06:01,754 --> 01:06:04,689
- What's the matter with you?
- Nothing. I feel in the pinks.

669
01:06:04,757 --> 01:06:07,817
Then stop looking like Lady Macbeth.
What's wrong with her?

670
01:06:07,894 --> 01:06:10,021
I don't know.
Can I get you something, Dorita?

671
01:06:10,096 --> 01:06:13,657
Oh, no, no, nothing.
I feel wonderful, if you don't mind.

672
01:06:13,733 --> 01:06:16,099
- Why don't you sit down? You seem restless.
- Oh, no, no.

673
01:06:16,169 --> 01:06:18,103
I like it here, just standing.

674
01:06:18,171 --> 01:06:20,901
- Aren't you tired?
- Yes, I guess I am.

675
01:06:20,974 --> 01:06:24,705
I think I go now and turn myself in
and get some shut eyes.

676
01:06:24,777 --> 01:06:27,143
- You know. Good night.
- Good night, Dorita.

677
01:06:27,213 --> 01:06:30,979
- I'll see you in a few minutes.
- Yes, good night.

678
01:06:39,325 --> 01:06:43,386
- Dorita, you're snoring again.

679
01:06:51,371 --> 01:06:53,430
Dorita! Dorita, wake up!

680
01:06:53,506 --> 01:06:55,440
What's the matter, buglers?

681
01:06:55,508 --> 01:06:59,171
- Where did you get this picture?
- What picture?

682
01:06:59,245 --> 01:07:03,045
You know what picture.
This picture of Casey.

683
01:07:03,116 --> 01:07:05,175
Your birthday next week, no?

684
01:07:05,251 --> 01:07:08,118
- Don't change the subject.
- I'm not changing anything.

685
01:07:08,188 --> 01:07:11,419
Casey sent you the picture
for your birthday. Only, he send to me.

686
01:07:11,491 --> 01:07:14,016
And now you have spoiled surprise.
That's all.

687
01:07:14,093 --> 01:07:17,790
No, I haven't. It's a much better
surprise this way.

688
01:07:17,864 --> 01:07:20,196
- You think so, huh? Yes?
- Mm-hmm.

689
01:07:20,266 --> 01:07:23,463
Good. I don't get it.

690
01:07:41,020 --> 01:07:43,352
Good heavens, 10:00!

691
01:08:16,022 --> 01:08:18,183
I might expect this
from you in person...

692
01:08:18,258 --> 01:08:21,159
but when your picture wanders
into strange girls' rooms-

693
01:08:21,227 --> 01:08:23,296
Really.

694
01:09:57,256 --> 01:09:59,224
Well! What do you want?

695
01:09:59,291 --> 01:10:03,159
Mr. Mason is serving everyone mint jalops,
and I bring you a mint jalops too.

696
01:10:03,229 --> 01:10:05,493
- It's delicious.
- You might have saved yourself the trouble.

697
01:10:05,564 --> 01:10:09,000
- I am a teetotaller. I never touch alcohol.
- You don't touch. You drink it.

698
01:10:09,068 --> 01:10:13,164
I'm very sorry, but I am a very busy man,
and I am never disturbed at this time.

699
01:10:13,239 --> 01:10:16,731
So I'm going to ask you to run away,
and take those poisonous things with you.

700
01:10:16,809 --> 01:10:20,768
No, I stay and be a teetotaller too.
Maybe show me how to teetotal.

701
01:10:20,846 --> 01:10:24,213
Miss Dorita, I am a businessman.
I go in for no foolishness.

702
01:10:24,283 --> 01:10:26,251
- I am entirely business.
- Oh, I like that.

703
01:10:26,318 --> 01:10:29,446
Maybe you show me how
to be all business too. Is it fun?

704
01:10:29,522 --> 01:10:32,821
Well, uh, fun? Business?
Why, certainly not. It's not supposed to be fun.

705
01:10:32,892 --> 01:10:34,484
- Oh, no?
- No.

706
01:10:34,560 --> 01:10:37,120
Then I don't think I like it.
I like to have fun.

707
01:10:37,196 --> 01:10:40,029
- You'll never make money that way.
- Oh, money, huh?

708
01:10:40,099 --> 01:10:44,126
You have lots of, don't you?
Thousands and thousands of dollars, huh?

709
01:10:44,203 --> 01:10:46,262
I've done rather well, yes.

710
01:10:46,338 --> 01:10:48,806
Look, Dorita has only a little.

711
01:10:48,874 --> 01:10:52,571
If she had only a few thousand,
she would not work for a boss.

712
01:10:52,645 --> 01:10:55,375
She would work for herself
in her own nightclub.

713
01:10:55,448 --> 01:10:58,315
Maybe you let her have
a few thousands, maybe?

714
01:10:58,384 --> 01:11:01,182
Well, certainly not!
I never heard of such nonsense.

715
01:11:01,253 --> 01:11:04,245
I never invest
in theatrical enterprises. Never.

716
01:11:04,323 --> 01:11:06,951
Now, I want you to take
these two slugs I think they call them...

717
01:11:07,026 --> 01:11:09,358
and you tell everybody you see
that I'm not to be disturbed.

718
01:11:09,428 --> 01:11:11,555
- What do you invest in?
- Oh, well, several things.

719
01:11:11,630 --> 01:11:14,098
- I have an investment counselor, really.
- What is that?

720
01:11:14,166 --> 01:11:18,000
- He's a man who handles my money for me.
- I have one of those too.

721
01:11:18,070 --> 01:11:19,662
- Who is it?
- Phil Baker.

722
01:11:19,738 --> 01:11:21,672
- Phil Baker, the actor?
- Yes.

723
01:11:21,740 --> 01:11:24,937
- He handles your money for you?
- Only, when he handle my money,
I never see it again.

724
01:11:25,010 --> 01:11:27,478
- Like these fiive horses with letters.
- Horses?

725
01:11:27,546 --> 01:11:29,537
- Yeah.
- You need say no more, Miss Dorita.

726
01:11:29,615 --> 01:11:32,743
I understand why you never see
your money again. You're a foolish girl.

727
01:11:32,818 --> 01:11:35,981
You should insist on sound investments.
Now, tell my wife-

728
01:11:36,055 --> 01:11:39,684
- Maybe you could handle my money for me.
- Sorry. I have no time.

729
01:11:39,758 --> 01:11:42,659
Oh, but how much time
would it took? How much time?

730
01:11:42,728 --> 01:11:44,719
It takes more time
than I could afford to give.

731
01:11:44,797 --> 01:11:48,528
Miss Dorita, I am in no mood
to listen to fiinancial suggestions.

732
01:11:48,601 --> 01:11:50,728
Oh, come on here.
Sit by me.

733
01:11:50,803 --> 01:11:54,102
Come on here. Sit by me and
tell me more about sound investments.

734
01:11:54,173 --> 01:11:56,835
- Yes, yes. You have the busiest hands.
- You think so?

735
01:11:56,909 --> 01:11:59,377
Sound investments?
Well, there are quite a few of them.

736
01:11:59,445 --> 01:12:02,573
- Quite a few I haven't got money for.
Just tell me one.
- One?

737
01:12:02,648 --> 01:12:04,775
- Yeah.
- Well, there's National Copper.

738
01:12:04,850 --> 01:12:06,784
- National Copper.
- That's very safe.

739
01:12:06,852 --> 01:12:11,118
That's pretty. I like it very much.
Thank you very, very nice. Yes.

740
01:12:11,190 --> 01:12:14,557
Well, uh, then, of course,
there's American Steel.

741
01:12:14,627 --> 01:12:18,927
American Steel.
That's beautiful too. I like too.

742
01:12:18,998 --> 01:12:20,966
Thank you very, very nice.

743
01:12:21,033 --> 01:12:24,730
I could say Tel and Tel.

744
01:12:24,803 --> 01:12:27,772
Tel and Tel.
I like that best of all!

745
01:12:27,840 --> 01:12:31,241
- I hoped you would. Yes, I hoped you-
- Yes!

746
01:12:31,310 --> 01:12:33,676
And did you play money
on this Tel and Tel?

747
01:12:33,746 --> 01:12:35,577
Very often.
Quite a lot of money, yes.

748
01:12:35,648 --> 01:12:38,412
- And she come in for you?
- Yes, if that's the way you want to put it.

749
01:12:38,484 --> 01:12:41,112
I want to put it that way, yes.
I want to put all my money on her.

750
01:12:41,186 --> 01:12:43,711
- On Tel and Tel?
- Yes! Thank you very, very much!

751
01:12:51,964 --> 01:12:54,626
Buddy, what's the matter?

752
01:12:54,700 --> 01:12:56,691
I don't know.

753
01:13:01,574 --> 01:13:04,475
- But it's happened.
- What happened?

754
01:13:07,713 --> 01:13:10,113
- Does that mean anything to you?
- No.

755
01:13:10,182 --> 01:13:13,379
- Well, it does to me.
- I don't understand.

756
01:13:13,452 --> 01:13:17,650
Oh, nobody is more surprised
than I am.

757
01:13:19,425 --> 01:13:21,620
Mr. Potty, I'm afraid of you.

758
01:13:21,694 --> 01:13:25,186
You are, really?

759
01:13:27,566 --> 01:13:30,126
National Copper, eh?

760
01:13:30,202 --> 01:13:33,035
- American Steel? Well-

761
01:13:33,105 --> 01:13:35,266
- Don't move!
- Mrs. Potty.

762
01:13:35,341 --> 01:13:38,640
Don't mention my wife.
We're going to keep this all on an even keel.

763
01:13:38,711 --> 01:13:40,645
Mrs. Potty-

764
01:13:40,713 --> 01:13:43,705
- Do you remember the other night
when we danced together?

765
01:13:43,782 --> 01:13:47,718
You do remember. Good.
You remember how I held you in my arms?

766
01:13:47,786 --> 01:13:50,186
That's the way I'm gonna hold you now.

767
01:13:50,255 --> 01:13:54,021
- No, no, no. Mrs. Potty!
- We'd like to be alone, please.

768
01:13:54,093 --> 01:13:59,497
Darling, how marvelous! We were just
discussing the invasion- the investments.

769
01:13:59,565 --> 01:14:01,726
It's Tel and Tel, Miss Dorita.
You mustn't forget it.

770
01:14:01,800 --> 01:14:03,825
That's one of
our soundest investments.

771
01:14:03,902 --> 01:14:06,700
You can't go wrong with Tel and Tel.
Can we, darling?

772
01:14:06,772 --> 01:14:08,763
Tel and Tel!
Oh, Tel and Tel!

773
01:14:08,841 --> 01:14:11,867
- Thank you very, very nice.
- Just a minute.

774
01:14:11,944 --> 01:14:14,276
It wasn't my fault.
He swooped me off my feet.

775
01:14:14,346 --> 01:14:17,042
- Oh, chop, chop, chop.

776
01:14:17,116 --> 01:14:19,050
So-

777
01:14:19,118 --> 01:14:23,555
Well, old swoopy, swapping swoops at your age.
What have you got to say about that?

778
01:14:23,622 --> 01:14:26,113
I told you, darling,
we were simply discussing investments.

779
01:14:26,191 --> 01:14:29,092
I see. Is that the way
it's being done nowadays?

780
01:14:29,161 --> 01:14:31,391
No wonder you come home
from the offiice so tired.

781
01:14:31,463 --> 01:14:34,694
That's what I say, dear.
That's what I say. No wonder.

782
01:14:34,767 --> 01:14:37,395
Oh. Ketchup.

783
01:14:37,469 --> 01:14:41,098
No doubt.
And from a Brazilian tomato.

784
01:14:55,554 --> 01:14:58,887
Darn it.
Hook me up, will you, soldier?

785
01:15:02,327 --> 01:15:04,761
- Thanks.
- Excuse me.

786
01:15:04,830 --> 01:15:09,199
- Hey, where are you going?
- Andy. Andy, welcome home, Son.

787
01:15:09,268 --> 01:15:12,169
- Dad.
- I knew you'd do it.

788
01:15:12,237 --> 01:15:14,569
Certainly looks good to see you again
after all these months.

789
01:15:14,640 --> 01:15:18,303
- That goes double, Dad.
- Why didn't you wire me?
I didn't expect you till evening.

790
01:15:18,377 --> 01:15:20,811
I flew in.
Gee, it's great to be home.

791
01:15:20,879 --> 01:15:23,814
But, Dad, what's going on around here?
The house is full of show people.

792
01:15:23,882 --> 01:15:28,046
Don't worry, Son. I locked up all the silverware
and put all the breakable stuff away.

793
01:15:28,120 --> 01:15:30,054
I've got a big surprise for you.

794
01:15:30,122 --> 01:15:32,590
- Oh, Vivian.
- Come in, Eadie.

795
01:15:32,658 --> 01:15:34,888
- Does that do it, Nanette?
- I think it will.

796
01:15:34,960 --> 01:15:36,928
- Good morning.
- Good morning.

797
01:15:36,995 --> 01:15:40,431
- My, but you look pretty.
- I hope so. Andy's coming home today.

798
01:15:40,499 --> 01:15:43,559
That's right. I'm looking forward
to meeting your Andy.

799
01:15:43,635 --> 01:15:46,331
- You'll like him.
- I'm sure I will.

800
01:15:46,405 --> 01:15:48,532
- There, that does it.
- Thank you, Nanette.

801
01:15:48,607 --> 01:15:51,667
- You're welcome, Miss Vivian.
- Well, what a coincidence.

802
01:15:51,744 --> 01:15:55,805
- What?
- This frame. I have one exactly like-

803
01:15:55,881 --> 01:15:58,145
What are you doing with this picture
on your dressing table?

804
01:15:58,217 --> 01:16:01,186
- That's the man I'm going to marry.
- Are you kidding?

805
01:16:01,253 --> 01:16:03,915
No, of course I'm not kidding.
It's a very good picture of him.

806
01:16:03,989 --> 01:16:07,186
- I agree with you.
- You do? You don't even know him.

807
01:16:07,259 --> 01:16:09,625
- Not really, but I've seen him.
- You have?

808
01:16:09,695 --> 01:16:13,461
Mm-hmm. Look.
Tsk, tsk, tsk.

809
01:16:13,532 --> 01:16:16,194
What would your sergeant
think of this?

810
01:16:16,268 --> 01:16:20,204
I'll bet Dorita had something
to do with it.

811
01:16:20,272 --> 01:16:22,638
You wait and see.

812
01:16:22,708 --> 01:16:24,642
Tell me, Dad,
what's the idea?

813
01:16:24,710 --> 01:16:26,974
It's a little surprise party
for you, Sergeant.

814
01:16:27,045 --> 01:16:29,138
Being as you're opposed
to bachelor dinners...

815
01:16:29,214 --> 01:16:32,980
we're staging a big show next door in
Potter's gardens, and you're the guest of honor.

816
01:16:33,051 --> 01:16:36,316
No fooling? You're really doing all that
for me? Gee, that's swell, Dad.

817
01:16:36,388 --> 01:16:38,322
Brought up the whole
Club New Yorker.

818
01:16:38,390 --> 01:16:40,585
Brought up the whole show.
Well, what do ya know?

819
01:16:40,659 --> 01:16:43,025
Say, wait a minute.
Did you say the Club New Yorker?

820
01:16:43,095 --> 01:16:46,064
- Sure.
- But that means Phil Baker and Dorita and Eadie-

821
01:16:46,131 --> 01:16:48,065
- Eadie's here, isn't she?
- You mean Miss Allen?

822
01:16:48,133 --> 01:16:50,533
- Yeah.
- Sure. She's one of their stars. You know her?

823
01:16:50,602 --> 01:16:53,230
Know her? I'm in love with her.
I'm going to marry her, Dad.

824
01:16:53,305 --> 01:16:55,671
- Now wait a minute, Son. Hold on.
- It's true.

825
01:16:55,741 --> 01:16:58,642
I came up to tell you-
to tell everybody.

826
01:16:58,710 --> 01:17:03,170
See here, the excitement's upset you.
You don't realize what you're saying.

827
01:17:03,248 --> 01:17:06,479
- You're gonna marry Vivian Potter, remember?
- Yes, yes, I remember.

828
01:17:06,552 --> 01:17:08,747
- But that can wait.
- Yeah.

829
01:17:08,821 --> 01:17:11,415
- Wait?
- Well, it's like this. You see-

830
01:17:11,490 --> 01:17:15,119
I can't explain now, Dad. I've got to see
Eadie right away. Where is she?

831
01:17:15,194 --> 01:17:18,789
- Why, she's next door with Vivian.
- With Vivian?

832
01:17:18,864 --> 01:17:21,162
You mean to say that she's over there
with Vivian right in the same house?

833
01:17:21,233 --> 01:17:23,667
- Sure.

834
01:17:23,735 --> 01:17:26,431
See here, Son.

835
01:17:26,505 --> 01:17:29,633
Was this Eadie Allen the unfiinished business
you had to attend to...

836
01:17:29,708 --> 01:17:32,268
that night at the Club New Yorker
just before you sailed?

837
01:17:32,344 --> 01:17:34,278
Mm-hmm.

838
01:17:34,346 --> 01:17:38,646
Well, you've certainly got
a nice fiinishing job on your hands.

839
01:17:38,717 --> 01:17:43,245
- Yeah, I sure have.
- You're gonna need a bracer
before you face those girls.

840
01:17:43,322 --> 01:17:46,655
Come on.
How about a nice mint jalopy?

841
01:17:46,725 --> 01:17:48,955
Oh, darn it.
She's got me saying it now.

842
01:17:49,094 --> 01:17:52,825
- Dorita, what have you done
with Sergeant Mason's picture?

843
01:17:52,898 --> 01:17:56,834
- Sergeant who?
- Sergeant Mason- the picture
that was in this frame.

844
01:17:56,902 --> 01:18:00,633
And Casey's picture, it's gone too.
What have you done with it?

845
01:18:00,706 --> 01:18:02,901
Dorita. Dorita,
what are you up to?

846
01:18:02,975 --> 01:18:07,469
Okay, I guess the jig is down.
I might as well make a clean chest of it.

847
01:18:07,546 --> 01:18:10,106
Your picture and Vivian's picture
is the same picture.

848
01:18:10,182 --> 01:18:14,118
- What are you talking about?
- Sergeant Mason is Sergeant Crazy
and vice-a-vice-a.

849
01:18:14,186 --> 01:18:17,815
You and Vivian both got same sweetheart
between you.

850
01:18:17,890 --> 01:18:20,984
- Dorita, you know, I think you're a little-
- No, no, I'm not little.

851
01:18:21,059 --> 01:18:23,823
I'll show you. Give me this picture.
You don't believe me, huh?

852
01:18:23,896 --> 01:18:27,889
I'll show you. Look.
There's your Sergeant Crazy.

853
01:18:27,966 --> 01:18:31,800
And I wash my face
of the whole business.

854
01:18:31,870 --> 01:18:33,804
Find it, Eadie?

855
01:18:33,872 --> 01:18:36,272
Andy's picture.
Then she did have it.

856
01:18:36,341 --> 01:18:39,037
- Are you, uh-Are you sure it's Andy?
- Huh?

857
01:18:39,111 --> 01:18:41,773
- Well, I mean-
- Well, of course it's Andy.

858
01:18:41,847 --> 01:18:44,281
Isn't he handsome?

859
01:18:49,454 --> 01:18:52,446
I wonder what made her
do a thing like that?

860
01:18:52,524 --> 01:18:55,823
I don't know.
I guess it was just one of her tricks.

861
01:18:55,894 --> 01:18:58,055
Oh, clowning, huh?

862
01:18:59,765 --> 01:19:02,495
Yeah...

863
01:19:02,567 --> 01:19:05,127
clowning.

864
01:19:07,239 --> 01:19:09,207
Dorita! Where's Eadie?

865
01:19:09,274 --> 01:19:12,334
Oh, it's you. Shame on you,
you Dr. Jekylls and Mr. Hydes.

866
01:19:12,411 --> 01:19:15,972
- Then Eadie knows. And Vivian?
- I just spilled the cat out of the beans myself.

867
01:19:16,048 --> 01:19:18,812
- You did. Gee, what'll I do?
- I don't care what you do.

868
01:19:18,884 --> 01:19:21,614
I know what I'd do if girl
take my man away from me.

869
01:19:21,687 --> 01:19:24,155
- What do you mean?
- I break her into little hunks...

870
01:19:24,222 --> 01:19:26,747
and then I break him
into little hunks.

871
01:19:26,825 --> 01:19:29,589
And then I take
all the little hunks and, uh-

872
01:19:29,661 --> 01:19:33,995
Well, good-bye.
I must do some rehearsalings.

873
01:19:34,066 --> 01:19:36,057
Vivian!

874
01:19:36,134 --> 01:19:38,398
- Andy, darling!

875
01:19:38,470 --> 01:19:42,463
Oh, let me look at you, you wonderful guy
with decorations and everything.

876
01:19:42,541 --> 01:19:44,475
Hug me again. Closer.

877
01:19:47,212 --> 01:19:51,239
It's good to have you home again after all
these months. I bet you didn't miss me.

878
01:19:51,316 --> 01:19:53,876
Or did you?
Well, come on. Tell me.

879
01:19:53,952 --> 01:19:56,113
Andy, darling,
what's the mat-

880
01:19:56,188 --> 01:19:59,123
Oh, Eadie, don't go.
Come here.

881
01:19:59,191 --> 01:20:02,558
This is my Sergeant Mason
I've been talking so much about.

882
01:20:04,262 --> 01:20:07,425
How do you do,
Sergeant... Mason?

883
01:20:07,499 --> 01:20:09,694
How do you do?

884
01:20:09,768 --> 01:20:12,396
- Well, aren't you going to introduce us?
- Huh?

885
01:20:12,471 --> 01:20:15,531
Oh, uh, this is
Sergeant Pat Casey.

886
01:20:15,607 --> 01:20:18,235
- Miss Potter and Miss Allen.
- Pleased to meet you, I'm sure.

887
01:20:18,310 --> 01:20:20,540
Sergeant Casey has been helping me
with my correspondence.

888
01:20:20,612 --> 01:20:24,207
Receiving certain letters for me
and handing them over.

889
01:20:24,282 --> 01:20:28,480
- Certain letters?
- Yes, you see, well, it's-

890
01:20:28,553 --> 01:20:31,044
That's right, Vivian.
You might as well know now.

891
01:20:31,123 --> 01:20:34,581
This is my Sergeant Casey. We were gonna
keep it a secret, weren't we, Pat?

892
01:20:34,659 --> 01:20:37,856
- Were we?
- Why, Eadie, they did know
each other in Australia.

893
01:20:37,929 --> 01:20:40,693
- Uh-huh.
- Isn't it a small world?

894
01:20:40,766 --> 01:20:42,791
- Yeah.
- Oh, Andy, listen.

895
01:20:42,868 --> 01:20:45,393
I have to run now.
I'm in the show and I have a rehearsal.

896
01:20:45,470 --> 01:20:48,132
So you'll excuse me, won't you?

897
01:20:48,206 --> 01:20:52,404
Oh, uh, why don't you all take a walk or something.
You and Eadie can get acquainted.

898
01:20:52,477 --> 01:20:55,469
Pat and I have so much to talk about.
Haven't we, Pat?

899
01:20:55,547 --> 01:20:57,572
- Have we?
- Oh, that's all right.

900
01:20:57,649 --> 01:21:00,550
Andy won't mind.
See you later, kids.

901
01:21:01,720 --> 01:21:04,280
Eadie-

902
01:21:04,356 --> 01:21:09,726
Pat, why don't you go watch the rehearsals.
Maybe some of the girls need hooking up.

903
01:21:09,795 --> 01:21:11,888
Eadie, where are you going?

904
01:21:11,963 --> 01:21:15,160
- What difference does it make?
- A lot.

905
01:21:15,233 --> 01:21:17,929
I'm sorry, Eadie.
Desperately sorry.

906
01:21:18,003 --> 01:21:21,200
- I was going to tell you, honest I was.
- Tell me what?

907
01:21:21,273 --> 01:21:24,003
About this whole thing, Vivian and me.
It doesn't mean anything.

908
01:21:24,076 --> 01:21:27,068
Just childhood sweethearts, that's all.
The families, you know.

909
01:21:27,145 --> 01:21:31,081
- I bet if you even ask Vivian, she'd tell you-
- She has told me.

910
01:21:31,149 --> 01:21:33,140
How much?

911
01:21:36,088 --> 01:21:38,079
Plenty.

912
01:21:39,491 --> 01:21:43,052
- Do you remember that night in the canteen?
- Uh-huh.

913
01:21:43,128 --> 01:21:45,790
I told you you were sweet.

914
01:21:45,864 --> 01:21:48,833
I meant it.
You were sweet.

915
01:21:50,502 --> 01:21:54,131
And you still are, Andy.

916
01:21:54,206 --> 01:21:59,007
But just because you guys
over there go through a lot of-

917
01:21:59,077 --> 01:22:01,773
Well, never mind.

918
01:22:01,847 --> 01:22:06,546
But what do you suppose the girls you
leave behind think of after you've gone?

919
01:22:06,618 --> 01:22:10,782
- Their man.
- Yeah, I guess they do.

920
01:22:10,856 --> 01:22:14,587
I don't have to guess.
I know.

921
01:22:14,659 --> 01:22:18,095
- I wrote you every day, didn't I?
- Yeah.

922
01:22:18,163 --> 01:22:21,223
At night I couldn't wait to get through
at the club so I could get home to write.

923
01:22:21,299 --> 01:22:24,564
I know you did.

924
01:22:24,636 --> 01:22:28,197
- How do you know?
- I just know, that's all.

925
01:22:28,273 --> 01:22:31,674
Yeah, you know.

926
01:22:31,743 --> 01:22:33,677
You men know everything.

927
01:22:33,745 --> 01:22:38,876
You can tear a girl's heart right out
of her and cut it up into little pieces.

928
01:22:38,950 --> 01:22:43,080
A girl knows that.
Every girl knows it.

929
01:22:43,155 --> 01:22:47,615
And that's why I'm gonna let
Vivian go right on through...

930
01:22:47,692 --> 01:22:49,626
even though
the stop signal's against her.

931
01:22:49,694 --> 01:22:54,688
- But, darling, you-
- I'm doing it because she- she believes in you.

932
01:22:54,766 --> 01:22:58,065
She loves you, Andy.

933
01:22:58,136 --> 01:23:00,969
No girl with understanding
would ever let another girl down.

934
01:23:01,039 --> 01:23:03,405
But you can't do this, Eadie.
L- I love-

935
01:23:03,475 --> 01:23:07,571
You love yourself, Andrew Mason.

936
01:23:07,646 --> 01:23:12,140
Why don't you try sitting
back among the crowd for a change...

937
01:23:12,217 --> 01:23:15,880
instead of up close
at the ringside.

938
01:33:42,846 --> 01:33:45,371
Oh, that's wonderful, Tony.
Do you really mean it?

939
01:33:45,449 --> 01:33:47,383
- Certainly.
- Then I'll go.

940
01:33:47,451 --> 01:33:50,045
- But what about your engagement to Andy?
- You leave that to me.

941
01:33:50,120 --> 01:33:52,054
- Splendid.
- See you after the show.

942
01:33:52,122 --> 01:33:54,090
- Okay.
- Oh, Eadie, isn't it wonderful?

943
01:33:54,157 --> 01:33:57,558
I'm on my way to Broadway.
I'm going to New York with Tony De Marco.

944
01:33:57,627 --> 01:33:59,925
- I'm his new dancing partner!
- What?

945
01:33:59,997 --> 01:34:02,397
I don't know what the folks
will say, about Andy, I mean.

946
01:34:02,466 --> 01:34:06,527
Of course, it's only a family affair.
We never really loved each other.

947
01:34:06,603 --> 01:34:09,663
- You mean that-
- Well, even Andy knows that.

948
01:34:09,740 --> 01:34:13,073
Anyway, the folks started it.
Let them work it out.

949
01:34:16,980 --> 01:34:20,916
- Eadie, come on. They're waiting.
- There's something I have to do.

950
01:34:20,984 --> 01:34:24,920
I know- the fiinale. You can't keep
those children waiting all night.

951
01:34:24,988 --> 01:34:28,981
But you don't understand. It's your son.
I have to tell him something he doesn't know.

952
01:34:29,059 --> 01:34:34,019
Then he's the only one who doesn't.
But just in case, I'll tell him.

953
01:34:34,097 --> 01:34:36,088
You will?
