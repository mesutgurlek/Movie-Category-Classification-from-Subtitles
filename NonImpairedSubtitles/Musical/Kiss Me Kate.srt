1
00:01:51,000 --> 00:01:54,000
Would you get the door, Paul?

2
00:01:59,000 --> 00:02:02,000
- Hi, Paul.
- Mr. Cole Porter, sir.

3
00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:04,000
- Thanks for coming.
- Hello, Fred.

4
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:07,000
You're right on time.
Everything's set.

5
00:02:07,000 --> 00:02:09,000
Keyboard's dusted,
and the piano's tuned.

6
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:14,000
That is a matter of opinion. By the way,
what was wrong with my place?

7
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:17,000
- You want Lilli to do the part, don't you?
- Very much.

8
00:02:17,000 --> 00:02:20,000
Then psychologically,
this is the proper setting.

9
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:24,000
- Here? Where you lived together?
- Oh, Lilli loved the apartment.

10
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:27,000
She'll be dying to see
if I've changed anything.

11
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:31,000
Even if she does come,
there's no guarantee she'll do the show.

12
00:02:31,000 --> 00:02:35,000
Of course she'll do it. It's a good
script, a great score, fat part.

13
00:02:35,000 --> 00:02:37,000
You're forgetting one thing.

14
00:02:37,000 --> 00:02:41,000
Besides directing the show,
you'll also be playing opposite her.

15
00:02:41,000 --> 00:02:45,000
Most actresses would
consider that an inducement.

16
00:02:45,000 --> 00:02:51,000
Under the circumstances, I should think
things might be a little strained.

17
00:02:51,000 --> 00:02:56,000
Because we used to be man and wife?
Oh, Cole, that's archaic.

18
00:02:56,000 --> 00:03:01,000
- We're adults. We're civilized.
- Oh, forgive me!

19
00:03:01,000 --> 00:03:03,000
I'd forgotten.

20
00:03:03,000 --> 00:03:08,000
Just one thing. When Lilli gets here,
start with a love song: "So in Love."

21
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:11,000
- She's a pushover for a sentimental lyric.
- Okay.

22
00:03:13,000 --> 00:03:14,000
That's her ring.

23
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:18,000
She always leans on the bell.

24
00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:24,000
Hello, Paul. How's the bursitis?

25
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:27,000
Better, thank you, Mrs. Graham.
I mean...

26
00:03:27,000 --> 00:03:29,000
Lilli Vanessi.

27
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:34,000
- Cole, how wonderful to see you again.
- Lilli, darling.

28
00:03:35,000 --> 00:03:37,000
- Hello, Fred.
- Hello, Lilli.

29
00:03:38,000 --> 00:03:41,000
- You look wonderful, Lilli.
- Thanks.

30
00:03:41,000 --> 00:03:45,000
Peace of mind.
It does wonders for you.

31
00:03:45,000 --> 00:03:49,000
- You ought to get rid of that spot.
- Never. It's a keepsake.

32
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:54,000
- You threw the inkwell, remember?
- I'm sure I had provocation.

33
00:03:54,000 --> 00:03:57,000
- Well, did you like the script?
- Oh, I loved it.

34
00:03:57,000 --> 00:04:02,000
- Would you care to hear the score?
- I'm dying to. That's the reason I'm here.

35
00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:04,000
- The only reason.
- Well, Fred...

36
00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:08,000
...this is sort of a musical version
of The Taming of the Shrew. 

37
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:10,000
- Shakespeare, you know.
- Yes.

38
00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:13,000
Let's see. Where should we start?

39
00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:17,000
Why don't we start
with a love song?

40
00:04:17,000 --> 00:04:20,000
- "So in Love"?
- Yes, it's great for Lilli.

41
00:04:21,000 --> 00:04:22,000
It's a duet.

42
00:04:25,000 --> 00:04:27,000
Well...

43
00:04:27,000 --> 00:04:29,000
So it is.

44
00:06:51,000 --> 00:06:53,000
It's beautiful, Cole.

45
00:06:53,000 --> 00:06:56,000
- You sang it beautifully.
- Thank you.

46
00:06:56,000 --> 00:06:58,000
But tell me something.

47
00:06:58,000 --> 00:07:01,000
Do you really think
I could play the shrew?

48
00:07:01,000 --> 00:07:03,000
You'd make a perfect shrew.

49
00:07:04,000 --> 00:07:08,000
What I mean is, it takes an actress
of real stature, like Judy Marlow...

50
00:07:08,000 --> 00:07:12,000
- Constance Collier.
- Connie Collier, Lynn Fontanne...

51
00:07:12,000 --> 00:07:14,000
- Great actresses.
- The costumes are great.

52
00:07:14,000 --> 00:07:17,000
For your entrance,
we've picked red velvet.

53
00:07:17,000 --> 00:07:20,000
- She looks wonderful in it.
- I know...

54
00:07:20,000 --> 00:07:24,000
There's another good song
in the score for Lilli. "I Hate Men."

55
00:07:25,000 --> 00:07:29,000
Now, here's what we had in mind
for the wedding scene.

56
00:07:30,000 --> 00:07:32,000
- Pretty, isn't it?
- It's certainly tempting.

57
00:07:32,000 --> 00:07:35,000
- Then you'll do it?
- It's difficult to refuse.

58
00:07:36,000 --> 00:07:38,000
I'll tell you what I'll do, I'll...
Well...

59
00:07:43,000 --> 00:07:45,000
- Expecting someone?
- No.

60
00:07:45,000 --> 00:07:48,000
Yes, though not just yet. I...

61
00:07:49,000 --> 00:07:51,000
Another bell-leaner?

62
00:07:54,000 --> 00:07:57,000
Hello. Hi, sweetie. Am I late?

63
00:07:57,000 --> 00:07:59,000
- No. Early.
- Oh, that's great.

64
00:07:59,000 --> 00:08:03,000
I just dashed over
between shows at the Copa.

65
00:08:04,000 --> 00:08:06,000
I hope you don't mind my legs.

66
00:08:06,000 --> 00:08:08,000
On the contrary.

67
00:08:09,000 --> 00:08:13,000
Oh, this is Miss Lane, the young lady
I was telling you about.

68
00:08:13,000 --> 00:08:15,000
- Telling me about?
- For the part?

69
00:08:15,000 --> 00:08:17,000
- Part?
- Bianca.

70
00:08:17,000 --> 00:08:19,000
- The younger sister.
- Younger?

71
00:08:19,000 --> 00:08:22,000
- Only in the play.
- Oh, of course. Bianca.

72
00:08:22,000 --> 00:08:25,000
It's a thrill meeting both of you.

73
00:08:25,000 --> 00:08:27,000
I just love your songs, Mr. Porter.

74
00:08:27,000 --> 00:08:31,000
And I'm just nuts
about your ex-husband.

75
00:08:36,000 --> 00:08:40,000
Sweetie, we're out of ginger ale.
Anybody want a drink?

76
00:08:40,000 --> 00:08:43,000
- What'll you have?
- Nothing, thank you.

77
00:08:43,000 --> 00:08:46,000
- Not right now.
- If nobody wants anything...

78
00:08:46,000 --> 00:08:49,000
...how about doing the number?
- Number?

79
00:08:49,000 --> 00:08:53,000
The big one I'm going to do,
the "Too Darn Hot" number.

80
00:08:53,000 --> 00:08:55,000
That must be the boys.

81
00:08:56,000 --> 00:08:57,000
Hi, fellas, come in.

82
00:08:58,000 --> 00:09:01,000
Didn't you tell her the number's out?
You told her she could play Bianca?

83
00:09:02,000 --> 00:09:04,000
Fellas, get over by the piano, will you?

84
00:09:05,000 --> 00:09:09,000
Mr. Porter, would you sit here?
And, Fred, sweetie, you sit over there.

85
00:09:12,000 --> 00:09:16,000
There, that's a square deal.
Okay. Go, boys, go.

86
00:12:42,000 --> 00:12:44,000
- Delightful.
- Thanks, honey.

87
00:12:44,000 --> 00:12:47,000
- How was I, Mr. Porter?
- Wonderful.

88
00:12:47,000 --> 00:12:49,000
- Great!
- Thanks, fellas. Take 10.

89
00:12:49,000 --> 00:12:53,000
There's a slight problem. We've taken
the number out of the show.

90
00:12:54,000 --> 00:12:57,000
Out of the show?
But you can't, Mr. Porter.

91
00:12:57,000 --> 00:12:59,000
Sweetie promised it to me.

92
00:13:00,000 --> 00:13:02,000
He promised faithfully.

93
00:13:03,000 --> 00:13:07,000
- You crossed your heart!
- He always does.

94
00:13:07,000 --> 00:13:11,000
- It didn't fit, honey.
- There's no place to put it, you see.

95
00:13:11,000 --> 00:13:12,000
No.

96
00:13:14,000 --> 00:13:18,000
Hey, wait a minute.
Now it's coming through to me.

97
00:13:18,000 --> 00:13:21,000
She wants to do the number.
You gave it to her!

98
00:13:21,000 --> 00:13:24,000
Why, that's absurd!
I wouldn't dream of displaying my legs.

99
00:13:24,000 --> 00:13:27,000
What's the matter with your legs?
Are you knock-kneed?

100
00:13:27,000 --> 00:13:30,000
- Why don't you ask Fred?
- Ladies, please...

101
00:13:30,000 --> 00:13:35,000
I don't think I ought to do the show.
It might interfere with my honeymoon.

102
00:13:35,000 --> 00:13:38,000
- Honeymoon?
- Yes. I'm being married, you know.

103
00:13:38,000 --> 00:13:41,000
Gee, congratulations!

104
00:13:42,000 --> 00:13:45,000
Sorry, Cole. Goodbye, sweetie.

105
00:13:46,000 --> 00:13:50,000
Oh, let her go. I can play Kate.
I can do the part.

106
00:13:51,000 --> 00:13:54,000
"Friends, Romans, countrymen,
lend me your ears."

107
00:13:54,000 --> 00:13:58,000
Great idea! You'd be wonderful
in the part. Wouldn't she, Cole?

108
00:13:58,000 --> 00:14:02,000
Oh, now, look, Fred...
Oh, sure! I'll get the sketches.

109
00:14:02,000 --> 00:14:06,000
I'll start coaching you.
You'll look wonderful in that dress.

110
00:14:06,000 --> 00:14:09,000
- You can't see my legs.
- We'll shorten it.

111
00:14:09,000 --> 00:14:10,000
- To here.
- Gee!

112
00:14:11,000 --> 00:14:16,000
Now, just a minute! What do you mean
giving my part to someone else?

113
00:14:16,000 --> 00:14:20,000
No, you're right. Nothing must stand
in the way of your honeymoon.

114
00:14:20,000 --> 00:14:22,000
Oh, no, you don't.

115
00:14:22,000 --> 00:14:25,000
You're not talking me
in and out of a hit show.

116
00:14:25,000 --> 00:14:28,000
- My script.
- Sweetie gave that part to me!

117
00:14:28,000 --> 00:14:30,000
Ladies, ladies.

118
00:14:59,000 --> 00:15:03,000
All right! All right, let's set
the final curtain calls.

119
00:15:03,000 --> 00:15:05,000
Back at 7 sharp, Sully.

120
00:15:06,000 --> 00:15:11,000
First call: Petruchio, Katherine and
Bianca. Miss Vanessi. Miss Lane.

121
00:15:15,000 --> 00:15:16,000
Madame.

122
00:15:23,000 --> 00:15:26,000
Could you manage to smile,
Miss Vanessi?

123
00:15:28,000 --> 00:15:31,000
All right. Let's have
a nice curtsy, ladies.

124
00:15:33,000 --> 00:15:36,000
We'll have to do better than that.
Watch Miss Lane.

125
00:15:36,000 --> 00:15:38,000
- It's really simple.
- It must be.

126
00:15:38,000 --> 00:15:43,000
Just raise your skirt and...
Oh, I forgot! Your knees.

127
00:15:43,000 --> 00:15:46,000
There's nothing wrong with my knees.

128
00:15:46,000 --> 00:15:48,000
You may step out now,
Miss Vanessi.

129
00:15:49,000 --> 00:15:51,000
Second call: Bianca
and the three suitors.

130
00:15:53,000 --> 00:15:56,000
Where the devil is that partner
of yours? Lucentio!

131
00:15:56,000 --> 00:15:58,000
Bill Calhoun!

132
00:16:00,000 --> 00:16:02,000
I think he went to the chiropodist.

133
00:16:02,000 --> 00:16:05,000
How am I doing, sweetie?
I mean, Mr. Graham.

134
00:16:05,000 --> 00:16:09,000
Very nice. Go to your dressing
room and relax until curtain time.

135
00:16:09,000 --> 00:16:13,000
- Let your mind go blank.
- Whatever thou sayest.

136
00:16:16,000 --> 00:16:19,000
Miss Vanessi,
I'd like to run over your bow.

137
00:16:19,000 --> 00:16:22,000
You were a bit awkward, you know.

138
00:16:24,000 --> 00:16:26,000
You louse!

139
00:16:27,000 --> 00:16:30,000
On-stage, everybody!

140
00:16:37,000 --> 00:16:39,000
Bill? Where is he?

141
00:16:39,000 --> 00:16:42,000
He's a prisoner of the Star Cab Company.

142
00:16:47,000 --> 00:16:50,000
Shoot you for it.
Double or nothing.

143
00:16:51,000 --> 00:16:54,000
- How much is it this time?
- Two dollars, lady.

144
00:16:54,000 --> 00:16:55,000
Oh, great!

145
00:17:01,000 --> 00:17:02,000
Thanks, lady.

146
00:17:03,000 --> 00:17:07,000
Honey, you're the cutest
piggy bank in town.

147
00:17:09,000 --> 00:17:11,000
Yeah.

148
00:17:15,000 --> 00:17:19,000
- Sure the donkey's housebroken?
- They guaranteed it.

149
00:17:19,000 --> 00:17:22,000
Well, if anything happens,
you're responsible.

150
00:17:23,000 --> 00:17:26,000
Bill Calhoun, have you
been gambling again?

151
00:17:27,000 --> 00:17:29,000
- How much did you lose?
- Two G's.

152
00:17:30,000 --> 00:17:32,000
Two thousand?
You haven't even got two dollars.

153
00:17:32,000 --> 00:17:35,000
- Signed an IOU.
- An IOU?

154
00:17:35,000 --> 00:17:39,000
- But not with my name.
- Whose name did you sign?

155
00:17:39,000 --> 00:17:41,000
Your boyfriend's.

156
00:17:41,000 --> 00:17:42,000
Frederick Graham.

157
00:17:42,000 --> 00:17:45,000
Oh, Bill, no!
This is our big chance.

158
00:17:45,000 --> 00:17:49,000
- Do you want to work nightclubs all your life?
- What's wrong with nightclubs?

159
00:17:49,000 --> 00:17:52,000
Nothing, if you like smoke, noise and drunks.

160
00:17:52,000 --> 00:17:55,000
You thought they were great
till you met this Hamlet.

161
00:17:55,000 --> 00:18:01,000
Mr. Graham is a gentleman and
a scholar. He's merely culturing me.

162
00:18:03,000 --> 00:18:07,000
- He's helping to further our careers.
- Whose? Yours or mine?

163
00:18:07,000 --> 00:18:09,000
- Both!
- Oh, Lois, dear?

164
00:18:10,000 --> 00:18:13,000
- Yes, sweetie?
- Has that hoofer showed up yet?

165
00:18:13,000 --> 00:18:15,000
No, he hasn't, sweetie.

166
00:18:15,000 --> 00:18:18,000
When he gets in,
tell him I want to see him.

167
00:18:18,000 --> 00:18:20,000
Yes, I certainly will, sweetie.

168
00:18:26,000 --> 00:18:27,000
Bill?

169
00:18:28,000 --> 00:18:29,000
Bill Calhoun?

170
00:18:31,000 --> 00:18:32,000
Where are you?

171
00:18:40,000 --> 00:18:44,000
- Oh, Bill.
- I'm sorry, honey.

172
00:18:47,000 --> 00:18:50,000
- Honest.
- Yeah. If you only meant it.

173
00:22:46,000 --> 00:22:48,000
Calling me a louse!
And on-stage!

174
00:22:49,000 --> 00:22:50,000
Sorry.

175
00:22:50,000 --> 00:22:53,000
I should have waited.
You louse!

176
00:23:01,000 --> 00:23:04,000
It's customary
for a gentleman to knock.

177
00:23:04,000 --> 00:23:08,000
I'm not a gentleman.
I'm a louse. Remember?

178
00:23:10,000 --> 00:23:14,000
Stop that infernal squeaking.
You know it gets on my nerves.

179
00:23:14,000 --> 00:23:18,000
What do you want me to do?
Bite them off?

180
00:23:18,000 --> 00:23:21,000
- Who is it?
- Suzanne. I've got your dinner tray.

181
00:23:21,000 --> 00:23:24,000
- Take it away.
- What do you mean, take it away?

182
00:23:25,000 --> 00:23:28,000
You can't eat before a performance.
It gives you indigestion.

183
00:23:28,000 --> 00:23:32,000
It's my stomach, thank you.
Bring it in, Suzanne!

184
00:23:32,000 --> 00:23:35,000
You'll not burp during
my love scenes. Take it away.

185
00:23:35,000 --> 00:23:37,000
Suzanne, don't you dare.

186
00:23:37,000 --> 00:23:41,000
- Let's make up our mind, shall we?
- It's made up.

187
00:23:42,000 --> 00:23:43,000
Out!

188
00:23:51,000 --> 00:23:56,000
Well, pick it up.
It's probably that cowboy.

189
00:23:56,000 --> 00:24:01,000
He is not a cowboy.
He's a cattle baron.

190
00:24:01,000 --> 00:24:06,000
Cattle baron? What's his crest?
A hamburger smothered with onions?

191
00:24:08,000 --> 00:24:12,000
Hello? Oh, hello, Tex, darling.

192
00:24:12,000 --> 00:24:15,000
I was expecting you at the theater.

193
00:24:16,000 --> 00:24:18,000
Oh, you're still at the stockyards.

194
00:24:19,000 --> 00:24:22,000
- What are they getting for New York cuts?
- How dare you!

195
00:24:22,000 --> 00:24:25,000
Tex, darling, I apologize. This...

196
00:24:26,000 --> 00:24:28,000
$ 1.30 a pound?

197
00:24:31,000 --> 00:24:35,000
Oh, but I wanted you to come
to the theater tonight, darling.

198
00:24:37,000 --> 00:24:39,000
Oh, the steer are restless.

199
00:24:42,000 --> 00:24:45,000
Yes, love. I'm blowing you two kisses.

200
00:24:49,000 --> 00:24:51,000
Bye, darling.

201
00:25:04,000 --> 00:25:07,000
All right. I give up. What is it?
Headlight of a locomotive?

202
00:25:08,000 --> 00:25:10,000
It's my engagement ring.

203
00:25:10,000 --> 00:25:14,000
- Well, I hope you'll be very happy.
- Thank you.

204
00:25:14,000 --> 00:25:18,000
Do you know what day this is, Fred?
Our anniversary.

205
00:25:18,000 --> 00:25:23,000
- What anniversary?
- The first anniversary of our divorce.

206
00:25:23,000 --> 00:25:25,000
And I have a little remembrance for you.

207
00:25:27,000 --> 00:25:30,000
Well, it's just what I wanted.
A cork.

208
00:25:31,000 --> 00:25:33,000
From our first bottle of champagne.

209
00:25:35,000 --> 00:25:37,000
Our wedding breakfast?

210
00:25:37,000 --> 00:25:39,000
In my apartment.

211
00:25:39,000 --> 00:25:43,000
You mean that one room of yours
over the Armenian bakery?

212
00:25:43,000 --> 00:25:46,000
You should complain,
you didn't even have a room.

213
00:25:46,000 --> 00:25:49,000
Why do you think I married you?

214
00:25:49,000 --> 00:25:53,000
That was the season we played
the Barter Theatre in Virginia...

215
00:25:53,000 --> 00:25:55,000
...and they gave you a ham.

216
00:25:56,000 --> 00:25:58,000
Well, we lived on it all winter.

217
00:25:59,000 --> 00:26:03,000
And I got a job reading tea leaves
at the Automat. Remember?

218
00:26:04,000 --> 00:26:07,000
And I demonstrated shaving soap
at the five-and-dime.

219
00:26:08,000 --> 00:26:11,000
That's how I spent my honeymoon...

220
00:26:11,000 --> 00:26:15,000
...at the five-and-dime,
watching you shave.

221
00:26:15,000 --> 00:26:17,000
Were we married then?

222
00:26:17,000 --> 00:26:20,000
Yes. Mother was staying with us.

223
00:26:21,000 --> 00:26:23,000
How could I forget?

224
00:26:23,000 --> 00:26:26,000
It was right after we closed in that...

225
00:26:26,000 --> 00:26:31,000
...Viennese operetta, laid in Switzerland,
only the costumes were Dutch.

226
00:26:31,000 --> 00:26:33,000
Oh, sure! Now I remember.

227
00:26:34,000 --> 00:26:36,000
I was understudying the lead.

228
00:26:37,000 --> 00:26:40,000
No, dear. We were both in the chorus.

229
00:26:40,000 --> 00:26:44,000
You know, there was a waltz
in that show. Something about...

230
00:26:44,000 --> 00:26:46,000
Something about a bar...

231
00:26:46,000 --> 00:26:48,000
Yeah!

232
00:26:50,000 --> 00:26:54,000
You are ravishing tonight.
You've made me the happiest of men.

233
00:26:54,000 --> 00:26:58,000
Ah, your highness, you overwhelm me.

234
00:30:02,000 --> 00:30:05,000
It was a good number, wasn't it?

235
00:30:06,000 --> 00:30:08,000
I always liked it.

236
00:30:11,000 --> 00:30:13,000
What happened to us, Fred?

237
00:30:15,000 --> 00:30:17,000
I don't know.

238
00:30:18,000 --> 00:30:20,000
Whose fault was it?

239
00:30:21,000 --> 00:30:24,000
Well, it could have been your disposition.

240
00:30:25,000 --> 00:30:27,000
It might have been your ego.

241
00:30:31,000 --> 00:30:33,000
Fifteen minutes.

242
00:30:41,000 --> 00:30:45,000
We'd... We'd better get dressed.

243
00:30:58,000 --> 00:31:00,000
I don't like my face.

244
00:31:00,000 --> 00:31:03,000
- Neither do I.
- Who are you?

245
00:31:03,000 --> 00:31:05,000
- Hey, fine-looking fellow.
- Clean-cut.

246
00:31:06,000 --> 00:31:10,000
- What are you doing backstage?
- What a figure! What a profile.

247
00:31:11,000 --> 00:31:13,000
Gentlemen, I'm deeply touched
by your admiration, but...

248
00:31:14,000 --> 00:31:15,000
- What diction!
- Very elocutionary.

249
00:31:16,000 --> 00:31:17,000
And he does not spit when he talks.

250
00:31:18,000 --> 00:31:20,000
This is all very flattering,
but I receive the public...

251
00:31:21,000 --> 00:31:24,000
...after the performance, not before.
- What grace!

252
00:31:24,000 --> 00:31:26,000
If I had to do something to him,
I'd cry like a baby.

253
00:31:27,000 --> 00:31:28,000
Come back after the performance.

254
00:31:28,000 --> 00:31:31,000
I'll be happy to present you
with my autograph then.

255
00:31:31,000 --> 00:31:35,000
We already got your autograph.
That's why we're here.

256
00:31:35,000 --> 00:31:38,000
Little matter of an IOU.
Here it is.

257
00:31:38,000 --> 00:31:41,000
Two G's.
Mr. Hogan, that's our employer...

258
00:31:41,000 --> 00:31:44,000
...he regards this as a debt of honor.
- Yeah.

259
00:31:44,000 --> 00:31:47,000
- How's about it, Mr. Graham?
- You're crazy.

260
00:31:48,000 --> 00:31:49,000
Here. Let me see that.

261
00:31:50,000 --> 00:31:55,000
- Why, that's not even my signature.
- That's what they all say.

262
00:31:55,000 --> 00:31:59,000
I'm surprised at you. You just signed this
this afternoon after a game over to the hotel.

263
00:32:00,000 --> 00:32:02,000
We wasn't there. Of course,
we got Mr. Hogan's word for it.

264
00:32:03,000 --> 00:32:06,000
You're really crazy. I've been in this
theater since 8 this morning.

265
00:32:06,000 --> 00:32:09,000
- He forgot.
- Yeah. Well, that's human beings for you.

266
00:32:10,000 --> 00:32:12,000
Once a man signs an IOU,
everything goes black.

267
00:32:13,000 --> 00:32:17,000
- Yeah, the doctors call it magnesia.
- We cure it.

268
00:32:17,000 --> 00:32:20,000
Gentlemen, would you mind leaving?

269
00:32:21,000 --> 00:32:23,000
Jeez, ain't he virile?

270
00:32:23,000 --> 00:32:26,000
And now we'd like to express our
best wishes for a magnificent opening...

271
00:32:27,000 --> 00:32:30,000
...and success of the brilliant talent
that you so richly deserve.

272
00:32:30,000 --> 00:32:33,000
- I copied that out of Western Union.
- Heartiest felicitations.

273
00:32:33,000 --> 00:32:37,000
- I made that up myself.
- Mr. Graham, try and joster your memory.

274
00:32:37,000 --> 00:32:39,000
Yeah. We'll be back, buddy.

275
00:32:42,000 --> 00:32:46,000
Not now. How many times I gotta
tell you? I'll let you know when.

276
00:32:46,000 --> 00:32:49,000
- They're bringing flowers.
- The funeral ain't till tomorrow.

277
00:32:50,000 --> 00:32:53,000
All right. Come on, will you?
What's the matter with you?

278
00:32:57,000 --> 00:32:59,000
- Yes?
- Good evening, Suzanne.

279
00:32:59,000 --> 00:33:01,000
From the master.

280
00:33:02,000 --> 00:33:03,000
Oh.

281
00:33:04,000 --> 00:33:05,000
Darling.

282
00:33:06,000 --> 00:33:08,000
Here are some flowers.

283
00:33:08,000 --> 00:33:10,000
From him.

284
00:33:10,000 --> 00:33:13,000
You see, Suzanne? He didn't forget.

285
00:33:14,000 --> 00:33:18,000
Violets and roses. My wedding bouquet.

286
00:33:19,000 --> 00:33:23,000
You need some food.
I better get back your dinner tray.

287
00:33:23,000 --> 00:33:28,000
No, Suzanne. I've made up my mind.
I won't touch a thing.

288
00:33:28,000 --> 00:33:32,000
If he wants me to go hungry,
I'll go hungry.

289
00:33:32,000 --> 00:33:35,000
When you can eat, eat.

290
00:35:17,000 --> 00:35:22,000
- Do you think it's creeping back?
- No, sir. We're keeping it at bay, sir.

291
00:35:24,000 --> 00:35:26,000
Thank you.

292
00:35:28,000 --> 00:35:31,000
- Did you deliver the flowers?
- Yes, sir.

293
00:35:33,000 --> 00:35:36,000
- Did you put the note in?
- Oh, yes, sir.

294
00:35:37,000 --> 00:35:40,000
Good. You took them upstairs
to Miss Lane personally, of course?

295
00:35:40,000 --> 00:35:43,000
Upstairs, sir? I thought they were for...

296
00:35:44,000 --> 00:35:46,000
Miss Vanessi?
Oh, you driveling idiot!

297
00:35:46,000 --> 00:35:49,000
- Do you know what you've done?
- Yes, sir. I've loused you up, sir.

298
00:35:50,000 --> 00:35:53,000
- Don't use that word.
- Yes, sir. No, sir. Quite, sir.

299
00:35:53,000 --> 00:35:56,000
- Oh, Fred.
- Now, now, now, Lilli.

300
00:35:56,000 --> 00:35:58,000
- I can explain everything.
- So thoughtful, darling.

301
00:35:59,000 --> 00:36:03,000
- You mean, you didn't read the card?
- Card? Was there a card? I didn't see one.

302
00:36:03,000 --> 00:36:06,000
Now, Lilli, you know I'm allergic
to roses. Give me hay...

303
00:36:06,000 --> 00:36:08,000
On-stage and good luck.

304
00:36:09,000 --> 00:36:12,000
- Okay. Let's go.
- Oh, Fred.

305
00:36:12,000 --> 00:36:14,000
- I can't. I just can't.
- Oh, no!

306
00:36:14,000 --> 00:36:17,000
My cheeks are burning
and my hands are freezing...

307
00:36:17,000 --> 00:36:21,000
...and my tummy...
- You ate! Lilli, you had something to eat!

308
00:36:21,000 --> 00:36:24,000
- No, I didn't. Really...
- You're not gonna whoops?

309
00:36:24,000 --> 00:36:26,000
- Yes, I...
- No, no. You can't. I won't let you.

310
00:36:26,000 --> 00:36:30,000
Oh, Mademoiselle Lilli, I found the card
that came with the flowers.

311
00:36:30,000 --> 00:36:33,000
- Thank you, Suzanne.
- No, no. There isn't time.

312
00:36:34,000 --> 00:36:37,000
Look, I'll tell you what I wrote:
"To Lilli, the only woman I've ever loved...

313
00:36:37,000 --> 00:36:39,000
...the only artist I've ever worshiped."

314
00:36:39,000 --> 00:36:41,000
Now, let me have the card, and let's go.

315
00:36:41,000 --> 00:36:45,000
- Did you really mean that, Fred?
- With all my heart.

316
00:36:45,000 --> 00:36:48,000
Then that's where it's going.
Right next to mine.

317
00:36:49,000 --> 00:36:52,000
I'm not nervous now
and I'm not going to whoops.

318
00:36:52,000 --> 00:36:56,000
And I'll never call you a louse
in public again. Never.

319
00:36:57,000 --> 00:37:01,000
You will, my sweet.
You will.

320
00:38:54,000 --> 00:38:57,000
This is the tale of Baptista Minola.

321
00:38:57,000 --> 00:39:01,000
A merchant of old Padua
who is firmly resolved not to bestow...

322
00:39:01,000 --> 00:39:04,000
...his younger daughter Bianca...

323
00:39:04,000 --> 00:39:08,000
...till he canst find a husband
for the elder, Katherine.

324
00:39:08,000 --> 00:39:11,000
A shrew!

325
00:39:11,000 --> 00:39:17,000
Oh, if I could only find a man who would
thoroughly woo her, wed her and bed her...

326
00:39:17,000 --> 00:39:20,000
...and rid my house of her!

327
00:39:20,000 --> 00:39:24,000
The fair Bianca has three stalwart suitors:

328
00:39:24,000 --> 00:39:27,000
Gremio, Hortensio and Lucentio...

329
00:39:27,000 --> 00:39:31,000
...who wouldst fain take the maid to wife.

330
00:39:32,000 --> 00:39:33,000
- I burn.
- I pine.

331
00:39:33,000 --> 00:39:34,000
I perish.

332
00:39:35,000 --> 00:39:39,000
Till I alone canst wed the fair Bianca.

333
00:39:40,000 --> 00:39:44,000
Sweet Bianca.
She sings as sweetly as a nightingale.

334
00:39:45,000 --> 00:39:50,000
She looks as clean and fresh
as morning roses newly washed with dew.

335
00:39:50,000 --> 00:39:54,000
To my father's pleasure, humbly I subscribe.

336
00:39:54,000 --> 00:39:57,000
My books of music shall be
my only company...

337
00:39:57,000 --> 00:40:02,000
...on them to look and practice by myself.

338
00:40:06,000 --> 00:40:08,000
Ah, me.

339
00:40:08,000 --> 00:40:11,000
A pity Katherine were not
of a gentler, milder mold.

340
00:40:12,000 --> 00:40:15,000
But she is shrewd and forward
beyond all measure.

341
00:40:15,000 --> 00:40:19,000
An irksome, brawling scold!

342
00:40:20,000 --> 00:40:23,000
Bianca is my father's treasure.

343
00:40:23,000 --> 00:40:25,000
She must have a husband
and for love of her...

344
00:40:25,000 --> 00:40:28,000
...I must dance barefoot
on her wedding day.

345
00:40:32,000 --> 00:40:36,000
Katherine, for shame.
Think on thy poor father.

346
00:40:36,000 --> 00:40:40,000
Oh, was ever father thus grieved as I?

347
00:40:42,000 --> 00:40:44,000
His grief will soon be put to rout.

348
00:40:44,000 --> 00:40:48,000
A happy wind blows me, Petruchio,
to Padua from old Verona...

349
00:40:49,000 --> 00:40:52,000
...for I am born to tame this Kate.

350
00:40:52,000 --> 00:40:53,000
Kate the Cursed.

351
00:40:54,000 --> 00:40:58,000
A title, for a maid, of all titles the worst!

352
00:41:20,000 --> 00:41:22,000
Father!

353
00:41:24,000 --> 00:41:26,000
- Poor child!
- She weeps!

354
00:41:27,000 --> 00:41:31,000
- What is it, sweet Bianca?
- I'm a maid who wouldst marry.

355
00:41:31,000 --> 00:41:32,000
- Any Tom?
- Dick?

356
00:41:32,000 --> 00:41:36,000
- Or Harry?
- Any Harry, Tom or Dick!

357
00:45:49,000 --> 00:45:50,000
Bianca! Bianca!

358
00:46:19,000 --> 00:46:22,000
- Petruchio!
- Well, Lucentio!

359
00:46:22,000 --> 00:46:25,000
What happy wind blows you to Padua
from old Verona?

360
00:46:26,000 --> 00:46:31,000
Such wind as scatters young men through
the world to seek their fortunes.

361
00:46:31,000 --> 00:46:33,000
- And you?
- I came to study.

362
00:46:35,000 --> 00:46:39,000
I am glad that you thus combine your resolve
to suck the sweets of sweet philosophy...

363
00:46:39,000 --> 00:46:42,000
...the mathematics and the botany.

364
00:46:42,000 --> 00:46:47,000
Fall to them as your stomach serves.
No profit grows where is no pleasure taken.

365
00:46:47,000 --> 00:46:49,000
In brief, sir, study.

366
00:46:49,000 --> 00:46:51,000
As for me...

367
00:49:05,000 --> 00:49:07,000
This gentleman is happily arrived.

368
00:49:08,000 --> 00:49:10,000
Petruchio is too much my friend.

369
00:49:10,000 --> 00:49:13,000
I cannot wish him a shrewd,
ill-tempered wife.

370
00:49:13,000 --> 00:49:16,000
- But she is rich.
- And young and beauteous.

371
00:49:16,000 --> 00:49:19,000
But shrewd, and forward
so beyond all measure...

372
00:49:19,000 --> 00:49:22,000
...that were my state far poorer
than it is...

373
00:49:22,000 --> 00:49:25,000
...I would not wed her for a mine of gold.
- Peace, Lucentio.

374
00:49:25,000 --> 00:49:27,000
Thou knowest not gold's effect.

375
00:49:27,000 --> 00:49:30,000
And therefore, if thou know one rich
enough to be Petruchio's wife...

376
00:49:30,000 --> 00:49:34,000
...tell me her father's name, and 'tis enough.
- Her father is Baptista Minola.

377
00:49:34,000 --> 00:49:37,000
- Her name, Katherine.
- Elder sister of the fair Bianca.

378
00:49:38,000 --> 00:49:39,000
Bianca!

379
00:49:39,000 --> 00:49:43,000
That is she.
An irksome, brawling scold.

380
00:49:44,000 --> 00:49:47,000
Think you a little din can daunt mine ears?

381
00:49:47,000 --> 00:49:49,000
Have I not in my time
heard great lions roar?

382
00:49:50,000 --> 00:49:55,000
Have I not heard great ordnance in the field
and heaven's artillery thunder in the skies?

383
00:49:57,000 --> 00:49:59,000
- Then you will woo this wildcat?
- Done.

384
00:50:00,000 --> 00:50:03,000
Go you to old Baptista and say,
"I have a husband for Katherine."

385
00:50:04,000 --> 00:50:07,000
Let's quaff carouses to this gentleman.

386
00:50:11,000 --> 00:50:15,000
Sister! Sister! Wrong me not!
Content thee in my discontent!

387
00:50:15,000 --> 00:50:19,000
Thou hilding of a devilish spirit, why dost
thou wrong her that did ne'er wrong thee?

388
00:50:19,000 --> 00:50:22,000
Her silence flouts me and I'll be revenged!

389
00:50:22,000 --> 00:50:26,000
- Oh, was ever father thus grieved as I?
- A word with you, kind sir.

390
00:50:26,000 --> 00:50:30,000
Importune me no further, for how
deeply I am resolved you know.

391
00:50:31,000 --> 00:50:33,000
Whisper louder.

392
00:50:35,000 --> 00:50:40,000
Oh, that is news. Good news!
Come in, Lucentio.

393
00:50:40,000 --> 00:50:44,000
Lucentio, thou meacock wretch!

394
00:54:44,000 --> 00:54:46,000
Katherine! Katherine!
Wonder of wonders!

395
00:54:47,000 --> 00:54:49,000
A gentleman from Verona
desires you in marriage.

396
00:54:50,000 --> 00:54:52,000
Then he'd best go back there!

397
00:55:01,000 --> 00:55:06,000
Greetings, good sir. I hear you have a
daughter called Katherine, fair and virtuous.

398
00:55:06,000 --> 00:55:10,000
- I have a daughter, sir, called Katherine.
- I am a gentleman from Verona, sir...

399
00:55:11,000 --> 00:55:15,000
...that, hearing of her beauty and her wit,
her affability and bashful modesty...

400
00:55:15,000 --> 00:55:18,000
...her wondrous qualities and mild behavior...

401
00:55:20,000 --> 00:55:25,000
Mild behavior, am bold to make myself
a forward guest within your house...

402
00:55:26,000 --> 00:55:29,000
...to make mine eye the witness
of that report which I so oft have heard.

403
00:55:29,000 --> 00:55:33,000
I'm afraid my daughter Katherine
is not for your turn.

404
00:55:33,000 --> 00:55:36,000
The more my grief.

405
00:55:36,000 --> 00:55:40,000
- I see you do not mean to part with her.
- Mistake me not.

406
00:55:40,000 --> 00:55:43,000
- Or else you like not of my company.
- You're more than welcome.

407
00:55:43,000 --> 00:55:47,000
Well, then. What dowry
shall I have with her to wife?

408
00:55:50,000 --> 00:55:56,000
- After my death, one half of my lands.
- The fertile part.

409
00:55:56,000 --> 00:55:59,000
- So be it.
- And in possession?

410
00:56:00,000 --> 00:56:03,000
- Twenty thousand crowns.
- Thirty.

411
00:56:07,000 --> 00:56:09,000
- Thirty!
- Father!

412
00:56:12,000 --> 00:56:14,000
Let specialities be therefore
drawn between us...

413
00:56:15,000 --> 00:56:17,000
...that covenants
may be kept on either hand.

414
00:56:18,000 --> 00:56:20,000
Go. Get thee to a notary.

415
00:56:21,000 --> 00:56:24,000
Aye, when that special thing
is well-obtained...

416
00:56:24,000 --> 00:56:27,000
...that is my love, for that is all in all.

417
00:56:29,000 --> 00:56:33,000
Of all the men alive,
I never yet beheld that special face...

418
00:56:34,000 --> 00:56:36,000
...which I could fancy
more than any other.

419
00:58:51,000 --> 00:58:54,000
"To my darling, let my lovely..."

420
00:58:54,000 --> 00:58:55,000
Lois?

421
00:58:58,000 --> 00:59:00,000
It was not to her liking.

422
00:59:01,000 --> 00:59:06,000
But that is nothing. For I tell you, Father,
I am as peremptory as she proud-minded...

423
00:59:07,000 --> 00:59:12,000
...and where two raging fires meet, they do
consume the thing that feeds their fury.

424
00:59:12,000 --> 00:59:15,000
I will attend her here and woo her
with some spirit when she comes.

425
00:59:15,000 --> 00:59:20,000
- If she bids me pack, I'll give her thanks.
- I bid thee pack!

426
00:59:22,000 --> 00:59:24,000
What's the matter, Fred?

427
00:59:25,000 --> 00:59:28,000
Were thine that special face.

428
00:59:31,000 --> 00:59:35,000
What have we here?
Some flowers from my daughter.

429
00:59:35,000 --> 00:59:38,000
Talk. Talk.
Speak, Petruchio, speak.

430
00:59:38,000 --> 00:59:42,000
Speak, Petruchio, though
thy message is not for me.

431
00:59:42,000 --> 00:59:44,000
You louse!

432
00:59:44,000 --> 00:59:46,000
Good morrow, Ka...

433
00:59:46,000 --> 00:59:50,000
We're on-stage now, Lilli! Good morrow,
Kate, for that's your name, I hear.

434
00:59:50,000 --> 00:59:53,000
Well have you heard,
but somewhat hard of hearing.

435
00:59:53,000 --> 00:59:56,000
They call me Katherine
that do speak of me.

436
00:59:57,000 --> 00:59:59,000
You lie, in faith,
for you are called Plain Kate...

437
01:00:00,000 --> 01:00:03,000
...and Bonny Kate and
sometimes Kate the Cursed.

438
01:00:03,000 --> 01:00:05,000
But Kate, the prettiest Kate
in Christendom.

439
01:00:05,000 --> 01:00:08,000
Hearing thy mildness praised
in every town...

440
01:00:08,000 --> 01:00:11,000
Thy virtue spoke of
and thy beauty sounded...

441
01:00:11,000 --> 01:00:14,000
...myself am moved to woo thee
for my wife. Come. Sit on me.

442
01:00:14,000 --> 01:00:17,000
Asses are made to bear
and so are you.

443
01:00:17,000 --> 01:00:20,000
Women are made to bear
and so are you.

444
01:00:20,000 --> 01:00:23,000
No such jade as bear
you with me, you mean.

445
01:00:23,000 --> 01:00:24,000
Come, come.

446
01:00:24,000 --> 01:00:30,000
- You wasp! I' faith, you are too angry.
- If I be too waspish, best beware my sting.

447
01:00:31,000 --> 01:00:35,000
- My remedy, then, is to pluck it out.
- Aye, if the fool could find it where it lies.

448
01:00:35,000 --> 01:00:40,000
Who knows not where a wasp
does wear his sting? In his tail.

449
01:00:40,000 --> 01:00:42,000
I swear I'll cuff you if you strike again!

450
01:00:42,000 --> 01:00:45,000
Keep on acting the way
you're doing, Miss Vanessi...

451
01:00:45,000 --> 01:00:48,000
...and I'll give you the paddling
of your life, and on-stage.

452
01:00:48,000 --> 01:00:50,000
- You wouldn't dare!
- No?

453
01:00:50,000 --> 01:00:52,000
If you strike me, you're no gentleman.

454
01:00:52,000 --> 01:00:57,000
- What is your crest, a coxcomb?
- A combless cock so Kate will be my hen.

455
01:00:58,000 --> 01:00:59,000
Come, give me thy hands.

456
01:01:00,000 --> 01:01:03,000
Come! And will you, nill you,
I will marry you.

457
01:01:03,000 --> 01:01:06,000
For by this light whereby
I see thy beauty...

458
01:01:06,000 --> 01:01:08,000
...thy beauty that doth make me
like thee well...

459
01:01:08,000 --> 01:01:11,000
...thou must be married to no man but me.

460
01:01:11,000 --> 01:01:14,000
For I am he
am born to tame you, Kate...

461
01:01:14,000 --> 01:01:18,000
...and bring you from a wild Kate to a Kate
conformable as other household Kates.

462
01:01:18,000 --> 01:01:20,000
Father! You devil.

463
01:01:20,000 --> 01:01:22,000
Petruchio, how speed you
with my daughter?

464
01:01:22,000 --> 01:01:25,000
How but well? It were impossible
I should speed amiss.

465
01:01:25,000 --> 01:01:28,000
We have 'greed so well together
that upon Sunday is the wedding day.

466
01:01:28,000 --> 01:01:30,000
May God give you joy. 'Tis a match!

467
01:01:31,000 --> 01:01:32,000
Amen, say we!

468
01:01:32,000 --> 01:01:35,000
Father and wife and
gentlemen, adieu.

469
01:01:35,000 --> 01:01:39,000
I will into Venice...
I'm warning you, Lilli.

470
01:01:39,000 --> 01:01:42,000
To buy apparel against the wedding day.
Sunday comes apace...

471
01:01:42,000 --> 01:01:45,000
...and we will have rings
and things in fine array.

472
01:01:45,000 --> 01:01:47,000
And kiss me, Kate.

473
01:01:48,000 --> 01:01:53,000
All right, Miss Vanessi. You asked
for it and you're going to get it.

474
01:01:53,000 --> 01:01:55,000
Fred, what are you doing?

475
01:02:01,000 --> 01:02:03,000
Stop it! Stop it!

476
01:02:13,000 --> 01:02:16,000
Suzanne! Suzanne, get me an ice pack,
quick. That's the last time...

477
01:02:16,000 --> 01:02:19,000
...you'll ever lay hands on me,
Frederick Graham.

478
01:02:19,000 --> 01:02:21,000
You asked for it.
May I remind you, Miss Vanessi...

479
01:02:21,000 --> 01:02:25,000
...the name of this piece is The Taming
of the Shrew,  not He Who Gets Slapped.

480
01:02:25,000 --> 01:02:28,000
Sending my wedding bouquet
to that little tramp!

481
01:02:28,000 --> 01:02:30,000
That's no excuse for ad-libbing. None.

482
01:02:30,000 --> 01:02:33,000
"Let my lovely Lois shine through
Bianca tonight...

483
01:02:33,000 --> 01:02:35,000
...and there'll be a new star
in the heavens."

484
01:02:36,000 --> 01:02:39,000
- Thou jerk!
- All right. All right.

485
01:02:39,000 --> 01:02:41,000
I sent the child some flowers.

486
01:02:41,000 --> 01:02:43,000
I sent a card with the flowers.

487
01:02:43,000 --> 01:02:46,000
May I remind you that I'm
free, male and 31?

488
01:02:46,000 --> 01:02:50,000
- 31?
- All right. I'm 32.

489
01:02:50,000 --> 01:02:52,000
What's my age got to do with it?

490
01:02:52,000 --> 01:02:54,000
They were full, rich years
and I'm proud of them.

491
01:02:55,000 --> 01:02:58,000
Show me an actor who's done what
I've done. My Peer Gynt in London.

492
01:02:58,000 --> 01:03:00,000
- They threw crumpets at you.
- My Hamlet in Dublin.

493
01:03:00,000 --> 01:03:03,000
You got paid in potatoes. Mashed.

494
01:03:03,000 --> 01:03:06,000
Money, money.
That's all you ever think of.

495
01:03:06,000 --> 01:03:10,000
The trouble with you, Miss Vanessi,
is you have no soul.

496
01:03:11,000 --> 01:03:13,000
What's the idea of
jabbing the ribs out there?

497
01:03:13,000 --> 01:03:16,000
- It's in the script.
- The devil it is.

498
01:03:16,000 --> 01:03:18,000
I couldn't teach you manners
as a wife, but by heavens...

499
01:03:19,000 --> 01:03:22,000
...I'll teach you manners as an actress.
- Not in this production, you won't.

500
01:03:22,000 --> 01:03:23,000
What did you say?

501
01:03:24,000 --> 01:03:25,000
You heard me.

502
01:03:25,000 --> 01:03:29,000
And here's a little something
that isn't in the script.

503
01:03:30,000 --> 01:03:32,000
What are you trying to do, kill me?

504
01:03:32,000 --> 01:03:35,000
Ralph? Ralph?

505
01:03:37,000 --> 01:03:39,000
Ralph!

506
01:03:39,000 --> 01:03:42,000
There's a law against attempted murder.

507
01:03:43,000 --> 01:03:45,000
Good heavens, I'm bleeding!

508
01:03:46,000 --> 01:03:48,000
- Yes, Mr. Graham?
- Quick, get me some alcohol.

509
01:03:48,000 --> 01:03:49,000
How do you want it?

510
01:03:49,000 --> 01:03:53,000
Oh, my rib.
I think she's broken a rib.

511
01:03:53,000 --> 01:03:56,000
- How can you tell if you have a broken rib?
- X-raying.

512
01:03:56,000 --> 01:04:00,000
Well, don't just stand there,
look in the prop room.

513
01:04:00,000 --> 01:04:02,000
Am I bleeding heavily?

514
01:04:03,000 --> 01:04:05,000
I don't see any blood.

515
01:04:05,000 --> 01:04:08,000
Here. What do you call that?

516
01:04:08,000 --> 01:04:11,000
- Suntan number two.
- What?

517
01:04:11,000 --> 01:04:15,000
Oh. Well, skin's bruised, though, isn't it?

518
01:04:16,000 --> 01:04:17,000
I don't see anything.

519
01:04:17,000 --> 01:04:19,000
Discolored?

520
01:04:19,000 --> 01:04:22,000
- Nope. Not a thing.
- What?

521
01:04:25,000 --> 01:04:27,000
That's all I need.

522
01:04:27,000 --> 01:04:30,000
A blind stage manager.

523
01:04:31,000 --> 01:04:34,000
All right, kids, let's get with it.
We got a quick change. Come on.

524
01:04:35,000 --> 01:04:39,000
Bill, you've simply got to tell Mr. Graham.
Signing somebody else's name is perjury.

525
01:04:39,000 --> 01:04:42,000
Honey, you don't understand.
Hogan's boys play rough.

526
01:04:42,000 --> 01:04:44,000
I could wind up with a broken leg.

527
01:04:44,000 --> 01:04:46,000
At least I'd know
where you were at nights.

528
01:04:46,000 --> 01:04:48,000
Bill Calhoun, you go in there
and tell Fred right now...

529
01:04:49,000 --> 01:04:52,000
...or you can find yourself
another piggy bank.

530
01:04:52,000 --> 01:04:55,000
Suzanne! Suzanne!

531
01:04:55,000 --> 01:04:58,000
Where's that ice bag?

532
01:04:58,000 --> 01:05:00,000
Hello, Tex?

533
01:05:00,000 --> 01:05:02,000
Tex, Lilli.

534
01:05:02,000 --> 01:05:05,000
Tex, I'll marry you tonight.
Send a car for me.

535
01:05:06,000 --> 01:05:07,000
No, better still, send an ambulance.

536
01:05:08,000 --> 01:05:12,000
You don't know what that beast
has done to me. I can't sit down.

537
01:05:12,000 --> 01:05:14,000
I said, I can't sit down!

538
01:05:15,000 --> 01:05:17,000
That is not where it hurts.

539
01:05:18,000 --> 01:05:19,000
I'm through with the theater.

540
01:05:19,000 --> 01:05:22,000
I want to go where no one
will ever find me.

541
01:05:22,000 --> 01:05:24,000
I'll go to Texas.

542
01:05:24,000 --> 01:05:27,000
Well, I'm quitting right now.

543
01:05:28,000 --> 01:05:31,000
Mademoiselle Lilli,
your ex-husband just dropped in.

544
01:05:31,000 --> 01:05:33,000
Suzanne, pack my things.

545
01:05:33,000 --> 01:05:37,000
You don't think that you can walk out of
a show in the middle of a performance?

546
01:05:37,000 --> 01:05:40,000
- Oh, no?
- I'll have you up on charges at Equity.

547
01:05:40,000 --> 01:05:42,000
I'll be glad, glad to appear before Equity.

548
01:05:43,000 --> 01:05:46,000
And I'll bring photographs of what
you've done to me. In Technicolor!

549
01:05:46,000 --> 01:05:50,000
- And I'll bring my x-rays!
- Tex says you ought to be lynched.

550
01:05:51,000 --> 01:05:53,000
Suzanne, unzip me.

551
01:05:53,000 --> 01:05:56,000
Lilli, you don't really mean
that you would?

552
01:05:56,000 --> 01:05:59,000
- Oh, you would?
- You bet I would!

553
01:05:59,000 --> 01:06:01,000
You'll never play the theater again.

554
01:06:01,000 --> 01:06:04,000
Oh, no? Well, I hate the theater...

555
01:06:04,000 --> 01:06:09,000
...and I hate actors,
and most of all, I hate you!

556
01:06:09,000 --> 01:06:12,000
Get out! Get out!

557
01:06:13,000 --> 01:06:16,000
- I thought this was your dressing room.
- Ralph! Ralph!

558
01:06:16,000 --> 01:06:18,000
There's something I want to tell you.

559
01:06:18,000 --> 01:06:19,000
Well, what is it? Ralph!

560
01:06:20,000 --> 01:06:22,000
This afternoon, when I went
to the chiropodist, I didn't.

561
01:06:22,000 --> 01:06:25,000
- He's not only blind, he's deaf.
- It seems I was in a little game...

562
01:06:25,000 --> 01:06:28,000
...down at the hotel. I lost some money.
- Yes?

563
01:06:28,000 --> 01:06:30,000
- Get the understudy ready.
- For you?

564
01:06:30,000 --> 01:06:32,000
No, no! Lilli. She refuses to go on.

565
01:06:32,000 --> 01:06:35,000
Trouble was, I was short,
so I signed an IOU.

566
01:06:35,000 --> 01:06:38,000
- Okay. I'll break the news to Jeanie.
- It seems I signed your name.

567
01:06:38,000 --> 01:06:39,000
Yeah, good. Fine.

568
01:06:39,000 --> 01:06:42,000
- Tell her to take a bromo.
- Fine?

569
01:06:42,000 --> 01:06:43,000
You mean you don't care?

570
01:06:43,000 --> 01:06:45,000
- Why, gee, Mr. Graham, thanks!
- All right.

571
01:06:45,000 --> 01:06:48,000
If I'd known you were such a great guy,
I wouldn't have...

572
01:06:48,000 --> 01:06:49,000
Oh, no, you don't.

573
01:06:49,000 --> 01:06:54,000
If she's leaving, she's leaving
on an empty stomach.

574
01:06:54,000 --> 01:06:56,000
- Thanks, Mr. Graham.
- All right.

575
01:06:58,000 --> 00:00:01,000
You signed my name?

576
01:07:02,000 --> 01:07:06,000
Why, you no-good, little...

577
01:07:06,000 --> 01:07:08,000
Oh, no.

578
01:07:08,000 --> 01:07:10,000
Hey! For us? Wow.

579
01:07:10,000 --> 01:07:13,000
You shouldn't have done it.
You shouldn't have done it.

580
01:07:13,000 --> 01:07:16,000
- Hey, what a performance.
- What unction, buddy.

581
01:07:16,000 --> 01:07:19,000
- You think the audience is digging it?
- They're a bunch of lowbrows.

582
01:07:19,000 --> 01:07:21,000
- Now, look here...
- We're just here to see...

583
01:07:21,000 --> 01:07:23,000
...if you jostled your memory yet.

584
01:07:23,000 --> 01:07:26,000
- Coleslaw.
- Hey.

585
01:07:26,000 --> 01:07:28,000
Oh, yeah. Mr. Graham, listen.

586
01:07:29,000 --> 01:07:32,000
We gotta know when you're
gonna pay your debt of honor...

587
01:07:32,000 --> 01:07:37,000
...to one of America's most respected
floating crap games.

588
01:07:37,000 --> 01:07:40,000
Look, I told you. I never signed anything.

589
01:07:40,000 --> 01:07:43,000
What's more, I can prove it. It was...

590
01:07:49,000 --> 01:07:52,000
Well, as a matter of fact...

591
01:07:53,000 --> 01:07:54,000
...I did sign that IOU.

592
01:07:54,000 --> 01:07:57,000
- He remembers!
- It all comes back to him.

593
01:07:57,000 --> 01:08:02,000
The trouble is, I haven't got the money.
I would have at the end of the week...

594
01:08:02,000 --> 01:08:04,000
...if the show could only run.
- It'll run.

595
01:08:04,000 --> 01:08:06,000
It's entertaining, vivacious...

596
01:08:06,000 --> 01:08:09,000
...and calculated to please the
most discriminating theatergoer.

597
01:08:10,000 --> 01:08:13,000
- You can quote me. Chicken?
- Yeah. Thanks.

598
01:08:14,000 --> 01:08:17,000
Sorry. Seniority, you know.

599
01:08:17,000 --> 01:08:22,000
You don't understand.
Miss Vanessi, my costar, is quitting.

600
01:08:22,000 --> 01:08:25,000
- Quitting?
- As of right now.

601
01:08:25,000 --> 01:08:28,000
Temperament. Didn't like the way
I played a little scene.

602
01:08:28,000 --> 01:08:31,000
She's dressing to leave the theater.

603
01:08:31,000 --> 01:08:37,000
Well, I guess all I can do is return whatever
money there is in the box office, that's all.

604
01:08:37,000 --> 01:08:39,000
Maybe we should talk to her.

605
01:08:40,000 --> 01:08:44,000
Fred, sweetie, I simply had to come...
Oh, excuse me.

606
01:08:44,000 --> 01:08:47,000
- Don't mind us. Go right ahead.
- Couple old friends of the family.

607
01:08:47,000 --> 01:08:48,000
On Lilli's side.

608
01:08:48,000 --> 01:08:52,000
I just wanted to say thank you
for being so wonderful about Bill.

609
01:08:52,000 --> 01:08:55,000
Oh. Well, look, honey, forget about it.
It was nothing.

610
01:08:55,000 --> 01:08:57,000
Nothing? Why, it was absolutely
noble of you.

611
01:08:58,000 --> 01:09:00,000
After all, he did sign your...

612
01:09:03,000 --> 01:09:07,000
And to be so understanding after doing
such a horrible thing like signing...

613
01:09:12,000 --> 01:09:16,000
I always knew you were a fine person,
but it took really a great man...

614
01:09:16,000 --> 01:09:20,000
...to forgive another man
for signing his...

615
01:09:25,000 --> 01:09:27,000
Fred, I...

616
01:09:27,000 --> 01:09:29,000
- Well!
- Stop, Lilli!

617
01:09:29,000 --> 01:09:31,000
Bill! Oh, Bill, wait, honey! Wait!

618
01:09:31,000 --> 01:09:35,000
You don't understand.
I was just saying thank you.

619
01:09:36,000 --> 01:09:38,000
How do you suppose she
says "You're welcome"?

620
01:09:38,000 --> 01:09:42,000
Hey, is that the little lady who's gonna
take a powder? We gotta dissuade her.

621
01:09:43,000 --> 01:09:45,000
- Oh, Lilli.
- You're wasting your breath. I'm leaving.

622
01:09:45,000 --> 01:09:51,000
Some very ardent admirers of yours.
Come in, gentlemen.

623
01:09:53,000 --> 01:09:55,000
- How do you do?
- What a trouper.

624
01:09:55,000 --> 01:09:59,000
What a personality. Allow me.

625
01:09:59,000 --> 01:10:02,000
Is it true you're contemplating quitting
this high-type entertainment?

626
01:10:03,000 --> 01:10:07,000
- I am. Careful.
- Miss Vanessi, the show must go on.

627
01:10:07,000 --> 01:10:10,000
Yeah. There's no business
like show business.

628
01:10:11,000 --> 01:10:14,000
We got a financial interest in the
success of this opus, Miss Vanessi.

629
01:10:14,000 --> 01:10:17,000
Therefore, we would like you to finish
the show till the end of the week...

630
01:10:18,000 --> 01:10:20,000
...when Mr. Graham can pay
off his debt of honor.

631
01:10:21,000 --> 01:10:24,000
Honor? He doesn't even know
the meaning of the word.

632
01:10:26,000 --> 01:10:29,000
- Beautiful, isn't it?
- Yeah.

633
01:10:29,000 --> 01:10:31,000
Her costume for the wedding scene.

634
01:10:31,000 --> 01:10:33,000
We'd like to see you model this.

635
01:10:33,000 --> 01:10:36,000
I'm sorry. My understudy
will be wear...

636
01:10:36,000 --> 01:10:41,000
- We think it would look better on you.
- Especially with your coloring.

637
01:10:41,000 --> 01:10:42,000
Are you threatening me?

638
01:10:42,000 --> 01:10:46,000
No, I'm just transferring the weight
from this side over to this side.

639
01:10:46,000 --> 01:10:48,000
Yeah, the bullets get kind of heavy.

640
01:10:48,000 --> 01:10:51,000
Shall we just step behind the screen
and try it on?

641
01:10:51,000 --> 01:10:55,000
- Fred?
- We'd be glad to help you zip it up, baby.

642
01:10:55,000 --> 01:11:01,000
Fred? Fred, don't just stand there.
Do something, do something!

643
01:11:01,000 --> 01:11:04,000
Gentlemen, this is an outrage.

644
01:11:44,000 --> 01:11:46,000
Come, my bonny Kate.

645
01:11:46,000 --> 01:11:50,000
I said come!

646
01:12:04,000 --> 01:12:07,000
Fred, look.

647
01:12:08,000 --> 01:12:12,000
I see puzzlement upon thy good faces.

648
01:12:12,000 --> 01:12:15,000
Who are these two angelic sprites
who bear my lady's train?

649
01:12:16,000 --> 01:12:19,000
They are distant relatives from Pisa.

650
01:12:19,000 --> 01:12:22,000
- What's a sprite?
- Some kind of fairy.

651
01:12:22,000 --> 01:12:23,000
Oh, yeah.

652
01:12:23,000 --> 01:12:25,000
Obey the bride, you that attend her.

653
01:12:26,000 --> 01:12:29,000
Go to the feast and revel and domineer.

654
01:12:31,000 --> 01:12:33,000
Leave us not lose our heads, buddy.

655
01:12:33,000 --> 01:12:38,000
Carouse full-measure. Be mad, be merry,
or go hang yourselves.

656
01:12:38,000 --> 01:12:41,000
But for my bonny Kate...

657
01:12:41,000 --> 01:12:43,000
She must with me.

658
01:12:43,000 --> 01:12:46,000
I will be master of what is mine own.

659
01:12:46,000 --> 01:12:48,000
She is my goods, my chattels,
my horse, my ox...

660
01:12:49,000 --> 01:12:50,000
...my anything.

661
01:12:50,000 --> 01:12:53,000
Touch her, whoever dares. I'll bring
mine action on the proudest he...

662
01:12:54,000 --> 01:12:56,000
...that dares to stop my way in Padua.

663
01:12:56,000 --> 01:13:00,000
Bring forth my noble steed.

664
01:13:00,000 --> 01:13:04,000
Come, Kate, most patient,
sweet and virtuous of wives.

665
01:13:04,000 --> 01:13:06,000
Thou must not soil thy dainty feet.

666
01:13:06,000 --> 01:13:09,000
Thou shall ride and I
will walk beside thee.

667
01:13:09,000 --> 01:13:12,000
You louse! You know I can't sit down.

668
01:13:13,000 --> 01:13:16,000
She resists! Then I shall cart her
to the nuptial chamber...

669
01:13:16,000 --> 01:13:19,000
...like a sack of flour going to the mill.

670
01:13:19,000 --> 01:13:20,000
Gentlemen, forward.

671
01:13:25,000 --> 01:13:27,000
- Bye.
- Goodbye!

672
01:13:38,000 --> 01:13:43,000
Hey, look! Come here. Hey!

673
01:13:55,000 --> 01:13:57,000
Watch it, lady!

674
01:13:57,000 --> 01:14:00,000
Come on, get up. Lady!

675
01:14:02,000 --> 01:14:05,000
Get back on. That's it. There.

676
01:14:13,000 --> 01:14:18,000
What? No men at my door to hold
my stirrup or to take my horse?

677
01:14:20,000 --> 01:14:23,000
Where be these knaves?

678
01:14:25,000 --> 01:14:27,000
- Where is Nathaniel?
- Here, sir.

679
01:14:27,000 --> 01:14:30,000
- Gregory!
- Here, sir.

680
01:14:30,000 --> 01:14:35,000
You loggerheaded and unpolished grooms.

681
01:14:35,000 --> 01:14:37,000
What, no attendance?

682
01:14:37,000 --> 01:14:42,000
No regard? No duty?

683
01:14:47,000 --> 01:14:51,000
Kind strangers, thou angels in disguise...

684
01:14:51,000 --> 01:14:54,000
...who didst help me in my hour of need.

685
01:14:54,000 --> 01:14:59,000
It were well you rested
from your travels in yon chamber.

686
01:15:02,000 --> 01:15:05,000
Get ye hence. Go to. Go to.

687
01:15:06,000 --> 01:15:10,000
- To flee or not to flee, that is the question.
- We wouldst not thinkst of leaving thou.

688
01:15:10,000 --> 01:15:14,000
Yeah. Going away is such sweet sorrow.

689
01:15:28,000 --> 01:15:30,000
Food, food, food!

690
01:15:31,000 --> 01:15:33,000
Sit down, Kate.

691
01:15:33,000 --> 01:15:36,000
Thou knowest full well that I cannot.

692
01:15:36,000 --> 01:15:41,000
Well, then, stand and be merry.
Some water here.

693
01:15:42,000 --> 01:15:46,000
Will you give thanks,
sweet Kate, or else shall I?

694
01:15:48,000 --> 01:15:52,000
- What's this? Mutton?
- Aye.

695
01:15:52,000 --> 01:15:55,000
- Who brought it?
- I.

696
01:15:55,000 --> 01:15:57,000
'Tis burnt.

697
01:15:57,000 --> 01:16:00,000
And so is all the meat.

698
01:16:01,000 --> 01:16:05,000
What dogs are these?
Where is the rascal cook?

699
01:16:05,000 --> 01:16:08,000
How durst you villains bring it from
the dresser and serve it thus to me...

700
01:16:08,000 --> 01:16:10,000
...that love it not?

701
01:16:10,000 --> 01:16:13,000
Here, take it away,
trencher, cups and all!

702
01:16:17,000 --> 01:16:19,000
Gin.

703
01:16:29,000 --> 01:16:31,000
I pray you, husband, be not so disquiet.

704
01:16:32,000 --> 01:16:34,000
The meat was well,
if you were so contented.

705
01:16:34,000 --> 01:16:37,000
I tell thee, Kate, 'twas burnt
and dried away...

706
01:16:37,000 --> 01:16:42,000
...and I expressly am forbid to touch it,
for it engenders choler, planteth anger...

707
01:16:43,000 --> 01:16:45,000
...and better it were
that both of us did fast.

708
01:16:45,000 --> 01:16:52,000
Since of ourselves, ourselves are choleric,
then feed it with such over-roasted flesh.

709
01:16:52,000 --> 01:16:54,000
Did you marry me to famish me?

710
01:16:54,000 --> 01:16:59,000
Tomorrow shall we eat, my honey love,
when we return unto thy father's house.

711
01:16:59,000 --> 01:17:02,000
Oh, no, you don't!

712
01:17:02,000 --> 01:17:06,000
Come. I will bring thee
to thy bridal chamber.

713
01:17:08,000 --> 01:17:12,000
- You louse!
- Attend thy mistress.

714
01:17:25,000 --> 01:17:31,000
Thus have I politicly begun my reign
and 'tis my hope to end it successfully.

715
01:17:32,000 --> 01:17:35,000
My falcon now is sharp
and passing empty...

716
01:17:35,000 --> 01:17:39,000
...and till she stoop,
she must not be full-gorged.

717
01:17:40,000 --> 01:17:44,000
She eat no meat today,
nor none shall eat.

718
01:17:44,000 --> 01:17:47,000
Last night, she slept not,
nor tonight she shall not.

719
01:17:47,000 --> 01:17:51,000
As with the meat, some undeserved fault
I'll find about the making of the bed...

720
01:17:52,000 --> 01:17:54,000
...and here I'll fling the pillow,
there the bolster...

721
01:17:54,000 --> 01:17:57,000
...this way the coverlet and
another way the sheets. Aye!

722
01:17:57,000 --> 01:18:00,000
And amid this hurly, I intend...

723
01:18:00,000 --> 01:18:05,000
...that all is done
in reverent care of her.

724
01:18:10,000 --> 01:18:13,000
This is a way to kill a wife
with kindness.

725
01:18:13,000 --> 01:18:17,000
And thus I'll curb her mad
and headstrong humor.

726
01:18:19,000 --> 01:18:24,000
He that knows better how to
tame a shrew, now let him speak.

727
01:18:25,000 --> 01:18:28,000
'Tis charity to show.

728
01:18:35,000 --> 01:18:37,000
Kate?

729
01:18:41,000 --> 01:18:44,000
My bonny Kate.

730
01:18:47,000 --> 01:18:50,000
My winsome Kate!

731
01:18:55,000 --> 01:18:58,000
I' faith, the woman shot her bolt.

732
01:18:59,000 --> 01:19:02,000
She has performed while I did act the dolt.

733
01:23:41,000 --> 01:23:44,000
There's a madman outside with an
ambulance. Insists on seeing you.

734
01:23:44,000 --> 01:23:47,000
Sorry. So does my audience.

735
01:23:47,000 --> 01:23:50,000
Where's my little girl? Where's Lilli?

736
01:23:53,000 --> 01:23:56,000
Please. There's a show on.
He'll be right with you.

737
01:23:58,000 --> 01:24:00,000
Keep an eye on her.

738
01:24:01,000 --> 01:24:03,000
You ought to be tarred and feathered!

739
01:24:03,000 --> 01:24:05,000
- Get Jeanie ready.
- Where I come from...

740
01:24:05,000 --> 01:24:07,000
...a man don't strike a woman.
- She hit me first.

741
01:24:07,000 --> 01:24:10,000
That's a lie. Why, that
little girl wouldn't hurt a fly.

742
01:24:10,000 --> 01:24:14,000
If you'd care to step over here,
you'll see the little girl in action.

743
01:24:17,000 --> 01:24:21,000
- What's she doing on that loading chute?
- Winding up.

744
01:24:28,000 --> 01:24:29,000
But I don't get it. How come...?

745
01:24:30,000 --> 01:24:33,000
How come she asked me
to bring an ambulance?

746
01:24:33,000 --> 01:24:35,000
My dear Tex...

747
01:24:35,000 --> 01:24:38,000
...you don't understand
the artistic temperament.

748
01:24:38,000 --> 01:24:41,000
You've been spending too much time
with your cows.

749
01:24:41,000 --> 01:24:43,000
She may even say to you tonight:

750
01:24:43,000 --> 01:24:46,000
"Darling, I'm playing the show
under duress. Call the FBI."

751
01:24:46,000 --> 01:24:49,000
- A very efficient organization.
- Yeah. We know them personally.

752
01:24:49,000 --> 01:24:53,000
- Why would she want the FBI?
- Why would she want an ambulance?

753
01:24:57,000 --> 01:24:58,000
All right, drop Scene 3.

754
01:24:58,000 --> 01:25:01,000
Jimmy. Three.

755
01:25:02,000 --> 01:25:05,000
Come on, kids, let's go.
You're on. Come on.

756
01:25:12,000 --> 01:25:15,000
Oh, Tex, thank heavens you're here.

757
01:25:15,000 --> 01:25:18,000
- Quick, call the FBI.
- The FBI?

758
01:25:19,000 --> 01:25:22,000
Now, look, honey. I don't mind bringing
an ambulance and a stretcher...

759
01:25:22,000 --> 01:25:25,000
...but Mr. Hoover's a pretty busy man.
- But you don't understand!

760
01:25:25,000 --> 01:25:27,000
- These thugs are threatening me!
- What thugs?

761
01:25:27,000 --> 01:25:31,000
These two. They're making me play
at the point of a gun.

762
01:25:31,000 --> 01:25:32,000
I thought they were actors.

763
01:25:32,000 --> 01:25:35,000
They're gangsters, I tell you.
They won't let me leave the theater.

764
01:25:36,000 --> 01:25:39,000
Are you referring to two of the most
promising graduates of the Abbey Players?

765
01:25:40,000 --> 01:25:42,000
Not to mention Civic Repertory,
the Theater Guild and others.

766
01:25:43,000 --> 01:25:45,000
And he's in cahoots with them!

767
01:25:45,000 --> 01:25:48,000
- They sure look like actors.
- They're not actors, I tell you.

768
01:25:48,000 --> 01:25:49,000
Lilli, you ought to be ashamed.

769
01:25:50,000 --> 01:25:53,000
Dragging this poor boy away from
the stockyards just for a whim!

770
01:25:53,000 --> 01:25:57,000
- Whim? Whim?! I'll show him my bruises!
- You can't. You're not married yet.

771
01:25:57,000 --> 01:26:00,000
We will be, as soon as we get back
to Texas. Everything is all set.

772
01:26:00,000 --> 01:26:03,000
- Our plane is ready to go.
- Tex, angel, I keep telling you...

773
01:26:04,000 --> 01:26:07,000
...I cannot get out of the theater!
- Why not?

774
01:26:07,000 --> 01:26:09,000
Those two apes won't let me.

775
01:26:09,000 --> 01:26:12,000
Of course she can leave the theater.
Can't she, boys?

776
01:26:12,000 --> 01:26:15,000
Well, yeah, she wouldst, but she can'tst.

777
01:26:28,000 --> 01:26:31,000
All right. Go ahead,
if that's what you want.

778
01:26:31,000 --> 01:26:34,000
After all, what's in the theater
to hold you?

779
01:26:34,000 --> 01:26:38,000
It's all so tawdry, the dreary
business of creating a part.

780
01:26:38,000 --> 01:26:40,000
Meaningless applause...

781
01:26:40,000 --> 01:26:43,000
...silly pictures in the papers.
Those boring parties...

782
01:26:43,000 --> 01:26:45,000
...and the ridiculous people
who stare and whisper:

783
01:26:45,000 --> 01:26:48,000
- "There goes Lilli Vanessi."
- I never want to see the theater again...

784
01:26:48,000 --> 01:26:50,000
...or you again!

785
01:26:51,000 --> 01:26:54,000
You're right, Lilli, you're absolutely right.

786
01:26:54,000 --> 01:26:57,000
Get out while you still have
a chance for happiness.

787
01:26:57,000 --> 01:27:00,000
Real happiness with this fine boy here.

788
01:27:00,000 --> 01:27:02,000
- Thanks, friend.
- You're welcome, partner.

789
01:27:05,000 --> 01:27:07,000
I must say, I envy you, Lilli.

790
01:27:07,000 --> 01:27:09,000
Me?

791
01:27:09,000 --> 01:27:12,000
The life that you lead with Tex...

792
01:27:12,000 --> 01:27:14,000
So different from the one
you had with me.

793
01:27:15,000 --> 01:27:17,000
I'll see to that.

794
01:27:17,000 --> 01:27:21,000
- No quarrels. No bickering.
- I want peace.

795
01:27:21,000 --> 01:27:22,000
And you shall have it.

796
01:27:23,000 --> 01:27:25,000
Peace, quiet, solitude.

797
01:27:25,000 --> 01:27:27,000
Oh, we've got plenty of that.

798
01:27:27,000 --> 01:27:30,000
Why, you can ride for nigh on to
two weeks and see nary a soul.

799
01:27:30,000 --> 01:27:32,000
Why, just think.

800
01:27:32,000 --> 01:27:35,000
- You can spend all day in the saddle.
- Oh, that's right.

801
01:27:35,000 --> 01:27:39,000
- I'm mad about horses.
- And eventually you'll stop falling off.

802
01:27:39,000 --> 01:27:42,000
Oh, she'll love the roundup.

803
01:27:42,000 --> 01:27:44,000
And the cattle branding.

804
01:27:44,000 --> 01:27:46,000
Why, I can see it now:

805
01:27:46,000 --> 01:27:48,000
Up at 5 and in the saddle.

806
01:27:48,000 --> 01:27:52,000
The dew is on the sage. A brisk
50-mile canter to the branding corrals.

807
01:27:52,000 --> 01:27:55,000
- That's right.
- Steer roped and waiting.

808
01:27:55,000 --> 01:27:56,000
Yeah.

809
01:27:57,000 --> 01:27:59,000
- Branding irons are sizzling.
- Yeah.

810
01:27:59,000 --> 01:28:03,000
You take one from the fire and
you hand it to the little woman.

811
01:28:03,000 --> 01:28:06,000
Ye... I do?

812
01:28:07,000 --> 01:28:10,000
She grabs the struggling critter.

813
01:28:10,000 --> 01:28:15,000
She grits her teeth
and the steam hisses.

814
01:28:18,000 --> 01:28:23,000
The red-hot metal
comes closer and closer.

815
01:28:23,000 --> 01:28:28,000
She grinds it into their shrinking hides.

816
01:28:29,000 --> 01:28:30,000
And the smell.

817
01:28:31,000 --> 01:28:34,000
The smell of burning flesh fills the air!

818
01:28:34,000 --> 01:28:36,000
I can't stand it.

819
01:28:37,000 --> 01:28:39,000
I think he swooned.

820
01:28:49,000 --> 01:28:50,000
Now, get out of here.

821
01:28:50,000 --> 01:28:55,000
Take your branding irons with you.
Go on, get out, all of you.

822
01:28:57,000 --> 01:28:59,000
- Ralph, where's Jean?
- Coming up!

823
01:28:59,000 --> 01:29:03,000
Just put her down very gently, sir.
You'll be all right, madam.

824
01:29:03,000 --> 01:29:06,000
There's been a misunderstanding.
Here's something for your trouble.

825
01:29:06,000 --> 01:29:08,000
Thank you very much, sir.

826
01:29:21,000 --> 01:29:22,000
Tex!

827
01:29:24,000 --> 01:29:25,000
- Tex Callaway.
- Howdy, ma'am. I...

828
01:29:26,000 --> 01:29:29,000
- Imagine meeting you here.
- Well, I...

829
01:29:29,000 --> 01:29:32,000
Don't you remember me, sweetie?

830
01:29:32,000 --> 01:29:33,000
No, I...

831
01:29:34,000 --> 01:29:36,000
At the Shamrock in Houston.

832
01:29:36,000 --> 01:29:41,000
I got something in my eye and you took
me all the way to El Paso to take it out.

833
01:29:41,000 --> 01:29:43,000
I'm sorry, but I'm afraid
you made a mistake.

834
01:29:43,000 --> 01:29:45,000
I still have that side of beef you gave me.

835
01:29:46,000 --> 01:29:48,000
I think of you every time
I look in the freezer.

836
01:29:48,000 --> 01:29:50,000
I'm sorry, but you must have
the wrong man.

837
01:29:51,000 --> 01:29:54,000
Wrong man, my foot.
I never forget a wealthy face.

838
01:29:55,000 --> 01:29:57,000
- Trying to annex Texas, huh?
- Excuse me.

839
01:29:57,000 --> 01:29:59,000
Oh, Bill, no!

840
01:29:59,000 --> 01:30:01,000
Bill, wait a minute. Wait.

841
01:30:01,000 --> 01:30:04,000
Bill, wait a minute!
I can explain! Come back!

842
01:30:05,000 --> 01:30:07,000
Oh, Bill, how could you?

843
01:30:07,000 --> 01:30:10,000
What a terrible thing to say when
a girl is good-hearted and normal...

844
01:30:11,000 --> 01:30:14,000
...and tries to get along
with her fellow man.

845
01:32:58,000 --> 01:33:01,000
All right, kids, you better get ready.

846
01:33:06,000 --> 01:33:09,000
Bill! Bill, sweetie!

847
01:33:10,000 --> 01:33:13,000
Say, pop.
Will you tell Miss Vanessi...

848
01:33:13,000 --> 01:33:15,000
...I'll wait for her on the buckboard?
- Yes, sir.

849
01:33:16,000 --> 01:33:18,000
- Thank you.
- Oh, no, thanks.

850
01:33:18,000 --> 01:33:21,000
Yeah. Hello, Gumpy.

851
01:33:21,000 --> 01:33:23,000
Yeah, I would like to converse
with Mr. Hogan.

852
01:33:24,000 --> 01:33:26,000
He's in conference? With who?

853
01:33:27,000 --> 01:33:28,000
Mugsy Higgins?

854
01:33:28,000 --> 01:33:30,000
You mean the big boss from the South Side?

855
01:33:30,000 --> 01:33:32,000
What are they talking about?

856
01:33:33,000 --> 01:33:35,000
- The North Side.
- He's probably trying to muscle in.

857
01:33:35,000 --> 01:33:38,000
- Mr. Hogan wouldn't stand for it.
- No.

858
01:33:38,000 --> 01:33:41,000
Well, look, it's very important
I should speak to Mr. Hogan.

859
01:33:41,000 --> 01:33:43,000
He's tied up?

860
01:33:43,000 --> 01:33:45,000
To a chair?

861
01:33:45,000 --> 01:33:48,000
Well, can you give him a message?

862
01:33:51,000 --> 01:33:54,000
- He already got one.
- Poor Mr. Hogan.

863
01:33:54,000 --> 01:33:56,000
So long, Mr. Graham.
I guess this is the end...

864
01:33:57,000 --> 01:33:59,000
...of our very, very pleasant association.

865
01:33:59,000 --> 01:34:01,000
Yeah. Like I said before, Mr. Graham...

866
01:34:01,000 --> 01:34:03,000
...going away is such sweet sorrow.

867
01:34:03,000 --> 01:34:06,000
- What do you mean?
- The debt is canceled.

868
01:34:06,000 --> 01:34:07,000
And so is Mr. Hogan.

869
01:34:07,000 --> 01:34:11,000
His unidentified remains will be found
floating in the river tomorrow.

870
01:34:11,000 --> 01:34:14,000
Except for the fact he'll be slightly
weighted down with cement.

871
01:34:14,000 --> 01:34:17,000
Rest his soul.

872
01:34:18,000 --> 01:34:19,000
Why, Miss Vanessi.

873
01:34:20,000 --> 01:34:22,000
We wish to say farewell
to you, Miss Vanessi.

874
01:34:22,000 --> 01:34:25,000
You are free to go. You do not
have to finish the show.

875
01:34:25,000 --> 01:34:27,000
- Oh?
- That's right. You can fly to Texas...

876
01:34:27,000 --> 01:34:28,000
...and marry that jerk.

877
01:34:28,000 --> 01:34:31,000
It has been a very delightful
experience, ma'am.

878
01:34:31,000 --> 01:34:35,000
We will not forget you soon,
Miss Vanessi.

879
01:34:35,000 --> 01:34:38,000
Should old acquaintance be forgot.

880
01:34:39,000 --> 01:34:42,000
- How do you like that? A slug.
- Yeah.

881
01:34:42,000 --> 01:34:44,000
Hey.

882
01:34:44,000 --> 01:34:48,000
- Think we better step out of these longies.
- Oh. Yeah.

883
01:34:48,000 --> 01:34:51,000
Mugsy Higgins might get
the wrong impression.

884
01:34:57,000 --> 01:34:59,000
Goodbye, Fred.

885
01:34:59,000 --> 01:35:01,000
Will you wish me luck?

886
01:35:02,000 --> 01:35:03,000
It won't work, Lilli.

887
01:35:03,000 --> 01:35:06,000
You belong in the theater. We both do.

888
01:35:08,000 --> 01:35:10,000
The theater. That's all you care about.

889
01:35:10,000 --> 01:35:13,000
You don't need me.
You've got an understudy.

890
01:35:13,000 --> 01:35:16,000
No one could ever take your place, Lilli.

891
01:35:16,000 --> 01:35:17,000
On-stage or...

892
01:35:18,000 --> 01:35:19,000
...or off.

893
01:35:19,000 --> 01:35:24,000
- You read those lines very well.
- If I do, it's because I mean them.

894
01:35:24,000 --> 01:35:26,000
With all my heart.

895
01:35:26,000 --> 01:35:30,000
Now, what script did you steal that from?

896
01:35:30,000 --> 01:35:32,000
It was a good script, Lilli.

897
01:35:32,000 --> 01:35:36,000
About two people who
fell in love and were married.

898
01:35:36,000 --> 01:35:38,000
It should have had a longer run.

899
01:35:38,000 --> 01:35:42,000
- Maybe it was bad casting.
- No, Lilli.

900
01:35:42,000 --> 01:35:45,000
The leading lady was great.

901
01:35:46,000 --> 01:35:48,000
It was the...

902
01:35:48,000 --> 01:35:52,000
...leading man. He just wasn't
big enough for the role.

903
01:35:54,000 --> 01:35:58,000
Mademoiselle Lilli,
Mr. Callaway is waiting.

904
01:36:34,000 --> 01:36:38,000
He's depressed.
His doll took a powder.

905
01:36:38,000 --> 01:36:41,000
- It's a dirty shame.
- Yeah.

906
01:36:41,000 --> 01:36:43,000
She's got breeding.

907
01:36:43,000 --> 01:36:44,000
And culture.

908
01:36:45,000 --> 01:36:48,000
She was a real classy broad.

909
01:36:49,000 --> 01:36:50,000
Well, cheer up.

910
01:36:50,000 --> 01:36:52,000
You still got your hair.

911
01:36:52,000 --> 01:36:55,000
Yeah, and you still got
your career, Mr. Graham.

912
01:36:55,000 --> 01:36:57,000
Just remember what the
immortal bard once said:

913
01:36:58,000 --> 01:37:03,000
"All the world's a stage, and all the
men and women merely players."

914
01:37:03,000 --> 01:37:04,000
Unquote.

915
01:37:05,000 --> 01:37:07,000
So remember this:

916
01:39:53,000 --> 01:39:56,000
Gentlemen, thou art divine.

917
01:39:56,000 --> 01:39:58,000
- Prithee.
- Finale, Mr. Graham.

918
01:39:59,000 --> 01:40:02,000
- All right. Well, we'll see you, boys.
- Yeah. So long.

919
01:40:03,000 --> 01:40:06,000
- Take good care of yourself.
- Say, good luck! Good luck, buddy!

920
01:40:06,000 --> 01:40:07,000
Thanks, pal! Good luck to you too!

921
01:40:08,000 --> 01:40:10,000
- What a swell guy.
- Yeah.

922
01:41:06,000 --> 01:41:09,000
My dear Bianca
and her newfound spouse!

923
01:41:19,000 --> 01:41:23,000
Feast with the best
and welcome to my house.

924
01:45:34,000 --> 01:45:38,000
Signor Petruchio,
my daughter Katherine...

925
01:45:39,000 --> 01:45:41,000
Where is Katherine?

926
01:45:42,000 --> 01:45:43,000
Where is she?

927
01:45:43,000 --> 01:45:46,000
By now, she should be flying over Newark.

928
01:45:47,000 --> 01:45:49,000
Where is the maiden?

929
01:45:49,000 --> 01:45:50,000
Sirrah!

930
01:45:50,000 --> 01:45:55,000
Go you to mistress Katherine and tell her
I command her to come to me.

931
01:45:56,000 --> 01:45:58,000
I know she will not come.

932
01:45:58,000 --> 01:46:02,000
The fouler fortune mine
and there an end.

933
01:46:02,000 --> 01:46:04,000
Jeanie's going on.

934
01:46:06,000 --> 01:46:10,000
Now, by my holy dame,
where is my daughter?

935
01:46:16,000 --> 01:46:18,000
- Where's Jeanie?
- I don't know. She was dressed.

936
01:46:19,000 --> 01:46:21,000
I'll find her.

937
01:46:22,000 --> 01:46:26,000
What is your will, sir,
that you send for me?

938
01:46:31,000 --> 01:46:34,000
What is thy will, sir?

939
01:46:40,000 --> 01:46:43,000
That's your cue, Fred.

940
01:46:46,000 --> 01:46:48,000
Katherine, I...

941
01:46:48,000 --> 01:46:51,000
I charge thee, tell
these headstrong women...

942
01:46:51,000 --> 01:46:55,000
...what duties they owe
their lords and husbands.

943
01:47:00,000 --> 01:47:03,000
I am ashamed that women
are so simple...

944
01:47:03,000 --> 01:47:06,000
...to offer war where they should
kneel for peace.

945
01:47:06,000 --> 01:47:09,000
Or seek to rule, supremacy and sway...

946
01:47:09,000 --> 01:47:14,000
...when they are bound to serve, love...

947
01:47:15,000 --> 01:47:17,000
...and obey.

948
01:47:17,000 --> 01:47:21,000
Why are our bodies soft
and weak and smooth...

949
01:47:21,000 --> 01:47:23,000
...unapt to toil and trouble in the world...

950
01:47:23,000 --> 01:47:26,000
...but that our soft conditions
and our hearts...

951
01:47:26,000 --> 01:47:29,000
...should well agree
with our external parts?

952
01:47:30,000 --> 01:47:33,000
So hold your temper, wives, and...

953
01:47:34,000 --> 01:47:39,000
And meekly put your hand beneath
your lord and husband's foot.

954
01:47:40,000 --> 01:47:46,000
In token of which duty, if he please...

955
01:47:47,000 --> 01:47:49,000
...my hand is ready.

956
01:47:51,000 --> 01:47:53,000
Ready may it do him ease.

957
01:47:57,000 --> 01:47:59,000
Ready. 

958
01:48:01,000 --> 01:48:02,000
Lilli.

959
01:48:05,000 --> 01:48:08,000
Why, there's a wench!

960
01:48:08,000 --> 01:48:11,000
Come on and kiss me, Kate.

961
01:48:32,000 --> 01:48:35,000
Come, Kate, and we'll to bed.

962
01:48:37,000 --> 01:48:40,000
A pox upon the life that late I led!
