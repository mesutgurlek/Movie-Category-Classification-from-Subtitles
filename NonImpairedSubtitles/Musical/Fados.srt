1
00:00:59,285 --> 00:01:01,322
Born on the day in the city.

2
00:01:02,006 --> 00:01:03,802
I spell,

3
00:01:06,206 --> 00:01:08,197
in my old Lisbon.

4
00:01:08,487 --> 00:01:10,124
another life.

5
00:01:12,846 --> 00:01:15,281
And with a knot of nostalgia.

6
00:01:15,447 --> 00:01:17,278
in the throat.

7
00:01:19,408 --> 00:01:22,161
I hear that a fado tunes.

8
00:01:22,409 --> 00:01:24,160
in the farewell.

9
00:01:26,488 --> 00:01:28,843
And with a knot of nostalgia.

10
00:01:29,009 --> 00:01:31,078
in the throat.

11
00:01:33,008 --> 00:01:35,920
I hear that a fado tunes.

12
00:01:36,088 --> 00:01:37,919
in the farewell.

13
00:01:40,129 --> 00:01:42,643
It was in the taverns
the Alfama,

14
00:01:42,809 --> 00:01:44,765
in a sad moment,

15
00:01:47,050 --> 00:01:49,518
this song where he was born,

16
00:01:49,690 --> 00:01:51,487
his regret,

17
00:01:54,010 --> 00:01:56,206
in memory of those who are

18
00:01:56,371 --> 00:01:58,283
like the wind,

19
00:02:00,332 --> 00:02:03,165
in the eyes of someone who loves

20
00:02:03,332 --> 00:02:05,209
and not give up.

21
00:02:07,533 --> 00:02:09,808
In memory of those who are

22
00:02:09,973 --> 00:02:11,406
like the wind,

23
00:02:14,212 --> 00:02:16,772
in the eyes of someone who loves

24
00:02:16,933 --> 00:02:18,810
and not give up.

25
00:02:20,454 --> 00:02:24,652
Glows when the old flame
feeling

26
00:02:27,695 --> 00:02:30,129
I hear this sea that roars

27
00:02:30,335 --> 00:02:32,326
while singing.

28
00:02:34,575 --> 00:02:37,248
And from a Madragoa Bica,

29
00:02:37,415 --> 00:02:39,167
at a time,

30
00:02:41,535 --> 00:02:44,095
always returns this anxiety

31
00:02:44,256 --> 00:02:46,087
at the time of departure.

32
00:02:48,297 --> 00:02:51,015
Production

33
00:02:52,537 --> 00:02:55,813
Script and direction

34
00:03:01,378 --> 00:03:03,892
Which only lives in the past,

35
00:03:04,058 --> 00:03:05,935
without goal

36
00:03:08,018 --> 00:03:10,771
is a prisoner of fate

37
00:03:10,938 --> 00:03:12,611
it invades ...

38
00:03:14,979 --> 00:03:18,655
<i> beginning of the busy
nineteenth century with the arrival in Lisbon </ i>

39
00:03:18,820 --> 00:03:22,415
<i> for work of thousands
people in rural areas, </ i>

40
00:03:22,580 --> 00:03:25,459
<i> but the colonies

41
00:03:25,621 --> 00:03:28,340
fado <i> arises in courtyards,
brothels and taverns. </ i>

42
00:03:29,901 --> 00:03:31,893
<i> This type of music has survived </ i>

43
00:03:32,061 --> 00:03:34,291
<i> until today
in its original form, </ i>

44
00:03:34,501 --> 00:03:36,936
But two centuries later <i>

45
00:03:37,182 --> 00:03:40,140
Portuguese <i> latitudes

46
00:09:19,698 --> 00:09:22,496
As a water source

47
00:09:23,419 --> 00:09:26,536
My hand is transparent

48
00:09:27,579 --> 00:09:30,616
in the eyes of my grandmother.

49
00:09:33,700 --> 00:09:36,850
Between land and sky

50
00:09:37,660 --> 00:09:40,811
my grandmother knew black

51
00:09:41,739 --> 00:09:44,856
those things of fate.

52
00:09:47,899 --> 00:09:50,972
I see the sea leads

53
00:09:51,940 --> 00:09:55,774
in the rivers of desire

54
00:09:56,101 --> 00:09:58,979
who was born to sing.

55
00:10:00,102 --> 00:10:03,139
The Zambezi
becomes the Tagus

56
00:10:04,142 --> 00:10:07,215
chanted many times
to envy

57
00:10:08,263 --> 00:10:11,016
Lisbon to live.

58
00:10:12,343 --> 00:10:14,903
Lisbon to live.

59
00:10:24,904 --> 00:10:28,102
I see a hair braiding

60
00:10:28,585 --> 00:10:31,702
the warm and singing fado

61
00:10:32,705 --> 00:10:35,697
in a shawl of tirabuzones.

62
00:10:38,906 --> 00:10:41,898
Like a fairy tale

63
00:10:42,866 --> 00:10:46,701
African drums
become guitars

64
00:10:47,226 --> 00:10:49,661
and coconut in sunflowers.

65
00:10:53,027 --> 00:10:55,985
My grandmother knew black

66
00:10:56,987 --> 00:11:00,060
how to read things in the destination

67
00:11:01,148 --> 00:11:04,141
in the palm of each eye.

68
00:11:05,149 --> 00:11:08,266
Life does not want or like,

69
00:11:09,229 --> 00:11:13,064
God told the witch

70
00:11:13,510 --> 00:11:16,262
I was born to sing.

71
00:12:03,914 --> 00:12:07,224
Girl, what's the matter,

72
00:12:07,675 --> 00:12:11,111
you're angry with me?

73
00:12:11,435 --> 00:12:15,224
Girl, what's the matter,

74
00:12:15,396 --> 00:12:18,832
you're angry with me?

75
00:12:18,996 --> 00:12:22,433
Is it because your black

76
00:12:22,597 --> 00:12:26,385
was not inclined
at your feet?

77
00:12:26,597 --> 00:12:30,067
Is it because your black

78
00:12:30,238 --> 00:12:33,549
has not been inclined to your feet?

79
00:12:49,599 --> 00:12:52,749
Let's make peace, my love,

80
00:12:52,958 --> 00:12:56,554
I got here, to its knees.

81
00:12:57,040 --> 00:13:00,588
Let's make peace, my love,

82
00:13:00,800 --> 00:13:03,998
I got here, to its knees.

83
00:13:04,600 --> 00:13:08,071
Let's make peace, my love,

84
00:13:08,321 --> 00:13:11,519
here I got on his knees.

85
00:13:13,242 --> 00:13:16,154
Here I am.

86
00:13:17,202 --> 00:13:20,161
Here I am.

87
00:13:24,164 --> 00:13:27,439
Girl, what's the matter?

88
00:13:27,884 --> 00:13:30,762
Why are you crying, do you?

89
00:13:31,724 --> 00:13:34,796
Girl, what's the matter?

90
00:13:35,685 --> 00:13:38,438
Why are you crying, do you?

91
00:13:39,365 --> 00:13:42,038
But if I cry why

92
00:13:42,885 --> 00:13:45,844
're angry with me.

93
00:13:46,846 --> 00:13:49,882
Cry if I am right,

94
00:13:50,365 --> 00:13:53,402
're angry with me.

95
00:14:09,887 --> 00:14:13,324
Let's make peace, my love,

96
00:14:13,528 --> 00:14:17,158
I got here, to its knees.

97
00:14:17,449 --> 00:14:20,759
Let's make peace, my love,

98
00:14:21,009 --> 00:14:23,922
I got here, to its knees.

99
00:14:34,491 --> 00:14:36,799
Here I am.

100
00:14:37,451 --> 00:14:39,965
Here I am.

101
00:14:41,251 --> 00:14:42,843
Here I am.

102
00:14:43,931 --> 00:14:47,049
Do not tell me what is the cause

103
00:14:47,692 --> 00:14:50,889
that I do not talk
when I entered.

104
00:14:51,412 --> 00:14:54,688
Do not tell me what is the cause

105
00:14:55,013 --> 00:14:57,970
that I do not talk
when I entered.

106
00:14:59,333 --> 00:15:02,405
It will be because your love

107
00:15:02,933 --> 00:15:06,164
I was already over.

108
00:15:06,854 --> 00:15:09,926
It will be because your love

109
00:15:10,294 --> 00:15:13,526
I was already over.

110
00:15:14,335 --> 00:15:17,487
It will be because your love

111
00:15:18,016 --> 00:15:20,893
I was not over.

112
00:15:21,975 --> 00:15:24,967
It will be because your love

113
00:15:25,416 --> 00:15:28,726
I already finished

114
00:15:29,775 --> 00:15:32,655
Let's make peace, my love,

115
00:15:33,137 --> 00:15:36,367
I got here, to its knees.

116
00:15:54,179 --> 00:15:56,295
Here I am.

117
00:15:57,699 --> 00:15:59,816
Here I am.

118
00:16:44,464 --> 00:16:48,424
The wind blows
too hard

119
00:16:50,706 --> 00:16:54,584
so you can relax.

120
00:16:56,905 --> 00:17:01,137
The wind blows
too hard

121
00:17:02,585 --> 00:17:07,137
so you can relax.

122
00:17:08,986 --> 00:17:13,503
There are in my thoughts

123
00:17:15,907 --> 00:17:20,219
something that is going to stop.

124
00:17:21,468 --> 00:17:26,064
There are in my thoughts

125
00:17:28,589 --> 00:17:31,387
something that is going to stop.

126
00:17:33,629 --> 00:17:38,226
Perhaps the thing of the soul

127
00:17:41,431 --> 00:17:44,867
who believe that life is real.

128
00:17:46,392 --> 00:17:51,340
Perhaps the thing of the soul

129
00:17:54,111 --> 00:17:57,387
who believe that life is real.

130
00:17:58,311 --> 00:18:03,670
Maybe this thing quiet

131
00:18:06,312 --> 00:18:09,941
that makes my soul alive.

132
00:18:11,513 --> 00:18:16,508
Maybe this thing quiet

133
00:18:18,834 --> 00:18:22,622
that makes my soul alive.

134
00:18:24,115 --> 00:18:28,950
Wind blows over,

135
00:18:31,996 --> 00:18:35,194
I am afraid to think.

136
00:18:37,316 --> 00:18:41,993
Wind blows over,

137
00:18:42,997 --> 00:18:47,866
I am afraid to think.

138
00:18:49,517 --> 00:18:54,194
My mystery myself Avivo

139
00:18:57,157 --> 00:19:00,628
if I lost in meditation.

140
00:19:02,398 --> 00:19:07,028
My mystery myself Avivo

141
00:19:09,839 --> 00:19:13,355
if I lost in meditation.

142
00:20:07,085 --> 00:20:11,204
Passing wind and forgets,

143
00:20:13,606 --> 00:20:17,440
Dust rises and falls.

144
00:20:19,686 --> 00:20:23,919
Passing wind and forgets,

145
00:20:24,847 --> 00:20:29,524
Dust rises and falls.

146
00:20:31,248 --> 00:20:36,402
Alas for me if I could

147
00:20:38,808 --> 00:20:42,848
know what is inside me.

148
00:20:45,409 --> 00:20:48,959
Oh, me if I could

149
00:20:50,331 --> 00:20:55,451
know what is inside me.

150
00:21:07,651 --> 00:21:11,485
Weep, weep fado,

151
00:21:11,652 --> 00:21:15,246
a fado died.

152
00:21:16,252 --> 00:21:19,130
Today, exactly a year ago

153
00:21:19,293 --> 00:21:22,888
Severa who died.

154
00:21:23,693 --> 00:21:27,323
The Count of Vimioso

155
00:21:27,493 --> 00:21:31,283
suffered a hard blow

156
00:21:31,454 --> 00:21:35,130
when they went to say:

157
00:21:35,295 --> 00:21:39,766
"Your Severe perished."

158
00:21:41,536 --> 00:21:45,449
Run to your grave

159
00:21:45,616 --> 00:21:49,212
and still get to see his body.

160
00:21:49,617 --> 00:21:53,086
"Goodbye, my Severa,

161
00:21:53,296 --> 00:21:57,370
God give you good luck. "

162
00:21:57,657 --> 00:22:01,411
In that heavenly kingdom,

163
00:22:01,616 --> 00:22:05,371
with your guitar in hand,

164
00:22:05,577 --> 00:22:09,810
become fado
the angels,

165
00:22:09,977 --> 00:22:13,653
his world upside down again.

166
00:22:15,699 --> 00:22:19,533
Until the San Pedro

167
00:22:19,699 --> 00:22:23,487
sitting at the gate of heaven

168
00:22:23,659 --> 00:22:27,051
andalusia come to see Severa

169
00:22:27,220 --> 00:22:31,294
was to give palms
and to sing a fado.

170
00:22:31,581 --> 00:22:35,290
Weep, fado, crying,

171
00:22:35,541 --> 00:22:39,295
Severa who perished.

172
00:22:39,502 --> 00:22:43,177
The flavor was fado

173
00:22:43,342 --> 00:22:47,654
it was completed.

174
00:22:52,903 --> 00:22:59,013
Oh, street Capelâo

175
00:23:01,783 --> 00:23:07,654
rushes of rosemary.

176
00:23:10,784 --> 00:23:16,303
Oh, Capelâo Street,

177
00:23:19,785 --> 00:23:26,624
rushes of rosemary.

178
00:23:28,907 --> 00:23:35,982
If my love reaches prontito

179
00:23:37,107 --> 00:23:40,942
besaré stone floor

180
00:23:42,027 --> 00:23:46,499
she stepped on to the
while passing.

181
00:23:48,828 --> 00:23:52,903
If my love

182
00:23:54,109 --> 00:23:58,626
prontito arrives

183
00:23:59,470 --> 00:24:03,258
besare stone floor

184
00:24:04,270 --> 00:24:08,548
she stepped on to the
while passing.

185
00:24:11,871 --> 00:24:18,185
I have the destination marking

186
00:24:20,072 --> 00:24:25,987
soon
I saw you on.

187
00:24:29,313 --> 00:24:35,150
I have the destination marking

188
00:24:37,393 --> 00:24:42,263
soon
I saw you on.

189
00:24:45,754 --> 00:24:50,590
Oh, my beloved gypsy,

190
00:24:52,636 --> 00:24:56,390
andalusia embraced live fado,

191
00:24:57,196 --> 00:25:01,987
hugging you die.

192
00:25:03,477 --> 00:25:07,833
Oh, my beloved gypsy,

193
00:25:10,076 --> 00:25:14,672
andalusia embraced live fado,

194
00:25:14,836 --> 00:25:18,990
hugging you die.

195
00:25:51,482 --> 00:25:58,161
Oh, my beloved gypsy,

196
00:25:58,523 --> 00:26:02,562
andalusia embraced live fado,

197
00:26:03,323 --> 00:26:07,873
hugging you die.

198
00:26:42,648 --> 00:26:45,037
A nightingale told me,

199
00:26:45,408 --> 00:26:48,682
viejito of Choupal,

200
00:26:49,127 --> 00:26:52,597
the most beautiful fish

201
00:26:52,767 --> 00:26:55,886
one died days

202
00:26:56,168 --> 00:26:59,080
for having repudiated

203
00:26:59,729 --> 00:27:02,880
His love fatal,

204
00:27:03,409 --> 00:27:06,560
a young troubadour

205
00:27:07,049 --> 00:27:10,439
which is love.

206
00:27:24,971 --> 00:27:27,405
Also came to sing

207
00:27:28,492 --> 00:27:31,165
their serenades

208
00:27:31,972 --> 00:27:34,770
on the banks of the Montego

209
00:27:35,653 --> 00:27:38,246
the genteel troubadour

210
00:27:39,053 --> 00:27:41,851
no matter ever

211
00:27:42,733 --> 00:27:45,964
gratae in their songs,

212
00:27:46,213 --> 00:27:49,524
the poor who die

213
00:27:49,774 --> 00:27:52,925
delivered to his love.

214
00:28:07,936 --> 00:28:10,894
They say that since then

215
00:28:11,416 --> 00:28:14,294
an echo murmurante

216
00:28:14,937 --> 00:28:17,451
responding in Choupal

217
00:28:18,497 --> 00:28:21,534
the band Estudiantina

218
00:28:22,138 --> 00:28:25,016
is the voice of Tricana

219
00:28:25,577 --> 00:28:28,887
he believes is the lover

220
00:28:29,258 --> 00:28:32,169
until today there is still singing

221
00:28:32,897 --> 00:28:35,492
its sad fate.

222
00:29:03,262 --> 00:29:06,016
Tribute to Marceneiro Alfredo,
poet of the street.

223
00:29:06,822 --> 00:29:09,132
A lifelong carpenter

224
00:29:10,182 --> 00:29:13,175
to sing fado
until death.

225
00:29:15,862 --> 00:29:17,739
Sad fado,

226
00:29:17,902 --> 00:29:19,460
sad fado.

227
00:29:19,622 --> 00:29:21,022
Carpenter.

228
00:29:21,303 --> 00:29:23,419
Carpenter all his life.

229
00:29:24,143 --> 00:29:25,861
Sad fado,

230
00:29:26,423 --> 00:29:27,823
sad fado.

231
00:29:31,584 --> 00:29:32,903
I was not born with a hammer

232
00:29:33,104 --> 00:29:34,936
or follow the footsteps of my father.

233
00:29:35,104 --> 00:29:36,254
No one wanted to be vague,

234
00:29:36,424 --> 00:29:38,222
but wondered whether
what I wanted to be

235
00:29:38,385 --> 00:29:40,501
I preferred to flee in a balloon.

236
00:29:40,945 --> 00:29:42,742
Looking for my profession,

237
00:29:42,905 --> 00:29:44,976
my way, in my training,

238
00:29:45,146 --> 00:29:46,864
I found a notebook with no stripes,

239
00:29:47,026 --> 00:29:48,858
Loose letters lost
a hatch.

240
00:29:49,467 --> 00:29:51,105
I looked for a hammer

241
00:29:51,266 --> 00:29:53,098
joined the words
and began to build.

242
00:29:53,508 --> 00:29:55,179
First idea: A Window

243
00:29:55,348 --> 00:29:56,576
to pass the truth

244
00:29:56,747 --> 00:29:58,147
that is not in the novels.

245
00:29:58,308 --> 00:29:59,627
A dark, lit a candle,

246
00:29:59,788 --> 00:30:02,303
I felt the smell of sawdust
and I wanted to make the sequel.

247
00:30:02,469 --> 00:30:04,107
Suddenly came to my mind

248
00:30:04,268 --> 00:30:07,021
a door
to exit that cell.

249
00:30:07,188 --> 00:30:08,416
I am

250
00:30:10,748 --> 00:30:12,784
> carpenter to death.

251
00:30:13,028 --> 00:30:14,905
> My blood flows and flows.

252
00:30:15,228 --> 00:30:17,184
My love,

253
00:30:19,308 --> 00:30:21,379
This also helps fado,

254
00:30:21,669 --> 00:30:23,387
The day also consumed.

255
00:30:23,790 --> 00:30:25,826
Soy

256
00:30:28,070 --> 00:30:30,140
Carpenter's death.

257
00:30:30,311 --> 00:30:32,062
My blood flows and flows.

258
00:30:32,510 --> 00:30:34,820
Question
flavors and pains

259
00:30:35,071 --> 00:30:37,983
which is my parents,
present and future.

260
00:30:38,152 --> 00:30:41,303
Do not forget the crying
that is revealed in their faces.

261
00:30:42,152 --> 00:30:43,632
I can not extinguish the flame.

262
00:30:43,792 --> 00:30:45,510
The need another nail bed.

263
00:30:45,712 --> 00:30:47,783
My body is delivered, exhausted.

264
00:30:47,953 --> 00:30:49,909
Embrace my Karma,
which was accepted

265
00:30:50,153 --> 00:30:51,950
and I need to return.
Need

266
00:30:52,113 --> 00:30:54,183
sandpaper in one hand.
Limo imperfections.

267
00:30:54,393 --> 00:30:56,623
Not trying to be perfect,
but the time I gently

268
00:30:56,793 --> 00:30:58,511
maturing in each piece.
It is my goal.

269
00:30:59,233 --> 00:31:01,190
I got letters all over the workshop.

270
00:31:01,354 --> 00:31:03,629
No reward
while there is no money.

271
00:31:03,834 --> 00:31:06,030
My mind just thinks
to have an idea.

272
00:31:06,314 --> 00:31:08,033
Is the life of a carpenter.

273
00:31:16,314 --> 00:31:18,624
Soy

274
00:31:20,875 --> 00:31:22,706
Carpenter's death.

275
00:31:22,876 --> 00:31:24,707
My blood flows and flows.

276
00:31:25,036 --> 00:31:27,756
My love,

277
00:31:29,357 --> 00:31:31,348
This also helps fado,

278
00:31:31,557 --> 00:31:33,354
The day also consumed.

279
00:31:33,677 --> 00:31:35,748
Soy

280
00:31:37,878 --> 00:31:39,948
Carpenter's death.

281
00:31:40,158 --> 00:31:42,035
My blood flows and flows.

282
00:31:42,918 --> 00:31:44,987
Was given the gift
of construction

283
00:31:45,158 --> 00:31:46,956
but with one condition:
Do not let

284
00:31:47,119 --> 00:31:49,872
using the heart,
with conviction.

285
00:31:50,038 --> 00:31:51,631
A mission that does not control,

286
00:31:51,839 --> 00:31:53,591
the task of sculpting,
a feeling

287
00:31:53,759 --> 00:31:55,432
or a simple scene.
Not in vain

288
00:31:55,760 --> 00:31:57,557
always believe that I belong.

289
00:31:57,759 --> 00:31:59,751
More
is to describe an emotion.

290
00:32:00,160 --> 00:32:02,196
Let your mind wander, do not be afraid

291
00:32:02,481 --> 00:32:04,471
make what you feel
in employment.

292
00:32:04,641 --> 00:32:06,552
Write your vision,
do not be blind.

293
00:32:06,801 --> 00:32:08,951
Use the hammer, no nails.

294
00:32:09,282 --> 00:32:11,034
Breathe, stop, think.

295
00:32:11,401 --> 00:32:13,757
Take off that tension.

296
00:32:13,921 --> 00:32:15,513
Cree with inner strength

297
00:32:15,761 --> 00:32:17,717
and forget what others think.

298
00:32:17,881 --> 00:32:20,555
The flame should not be turned off.

299
00:32:21,962 --> 00:32:23,476
It should not be shut down

300
00:32:23,962 --> 00:32:25,635
the flame.

301
00:32:54,926 --> 00:32:57,599
Caught the morning

302
00:33:01,367 --> 00:33:03,722
like a child.

303
00:33:08,128 --> 00:33:10,961
A rosebush interwoven,

304
00:33:13,529 --> 00:33:15,644
a strain of hope.

305
00:33:19,528 --> 00:33:22,440
As the body
the city

306
00:33:24,728 --> 00:33:27,288
that early in the morning
dance rehearsal

307
00:33:31,209 --> 00:33:34,406
of those,
force of will,

308
00:33:35,570 --> 00:33:39,006
never tire of working.

309
00:33:43,811 --> 00:33:46,724
Walk the street with the moon

310
00:33:48,372 --> 00:33:51,283
in my Tajo
lights early.

311
00:33:55,212 --> 00:33:58,205
Vago for Lisbon
tide naked

312
00:33:59,453 --> 00:34:02,126
which empties into the Rossio.

313
00:34:06,853 --> 00:34:10,291
I'm a man of the city

314
00:34:13,134 --> 00:34:16,252
that early in the morning
wakes up and sings,

315
00:34:19,814 --> 00:34:23,125
and love for freedom

316
00:34:24,934 --> 00:34:27,449
the city stands.

317
00:34:31,935 --> 00:34:34,928
I go down the street
dazzled

318
00:34:37,016 --> 00:34:39,326
by the full moon in Lisbon

319
00:34:43,858 --> 00:34:47,055
until the moon in love

320
00:34:48,978 --> 00:34:52,129
grows in the sailing of the canoe.

321
00:34:56,259 --> 00:34:58,932
I am the seagull that defeat

322
00:35:00,859 --> 00:35:03,612
any weather
at sea

323
00:35:08,260 --> 00:35:11,013
I am the man who carries

324
00:35:12,860 --> 00:35:15,773
the tide of people scared.

325
00:35:19,980 --> 00:35:24,372
And when caught the morning,

326
00:35:25,822 --> 00:35:29,177
capture the morning like a flower

327
00:35:33,543 --> 00:35:36,740
at the edge of the penalty deflowered.

328
00:35:38,303 --> 00:35:41,022
A blue margarita,

329
00:35:45,423 --> 00:35:48,063
daisy of freedom

330
00:35:49,624 --> 00:35:53,139
I want as anybody.

331
00:35:57,225 --> 00:36:00,342
Daisy in this city

332
00:36:01,625 --> 00:36:03,537
I want,

333
00:36:03,746 --> 00:36:05,862
I want to.

334
00:36:09,346 --> 00:36:12,180
In my hands, the morning

335
00:36:13,547 --> 00:36:16,938
also opened the flower April.

336
00:36:21,227 --> 00:36:25,266
Flower without fear, perfumed

337
00:36:27,308 --> 00:36:30,266
with the aroma of the sea.

338
00:36:34,389 --> 00:36:37,699
Flor de Lisboa, well loved,

339
00:36:39,109 --> 00:36:41,577
I do not want

340
00:36:44,429 --> 00:36:47,388
but now I want.

341
00:36:54,110 --> 00:36:57,626
It was in the Travessa da Palha

342
00:36:58,231 --> 00:37:00,746
where my lover, a scoundrel,

343
00:37:01,111 --> 00:37:03,387
made my heart bleed.

344
00:37:06,553 --> 00:37:09,829
Bringing to another lover,

345
00:37:10,233 --> 00:37:12,667
came contours, petulant,

346
00:37:13,073 --> 00:37:15,793
with an air of provocation.

347
00:37:18,634 --> 00:37:21,989
Bringing to another lover,

348
00:37:22,194 --> 00:37:24,708
came contours, petulant,

349
00:37:25,074 --> 00:37:27,541
with an air of provocation.

350
00:37:30,994 --> 00:37:33,906
In the tavern Friagem,

351
00:37:34,195 --> 00:37:36,993
between a bunch of Fados,

352
00:37:37,194 --> 00:37:40,028
I came to them without rancor.

353
00:37:42,995 --> 00:37:46,192
Because the woman who brought

354
00:37:46,436 --> 00:37:48,996
certainly not worth

355
00:37:49,317 --> 00:37:52,787
or shade

356
00:37:54,718 --> 00:37:57,629
my love.

357
00:38:00,518 --> 00:38:03,874
Because the woman who brought

358
00:38:04,118 --> 00:38:06,508
certainly not worth

359
00:38:06,719 --> 00:38:09,472
nor the shadow of my love.

360
00:38:26,320 --> 00:38:28,880
It was in the Travessa da Palha

361
00:38:29,361 --> 00:38:32,079
where my lover, a scoundrel,

362
00:38:32,560 --> 00:38:34,870
made my heart bleed

363
00:38:38,202 --> 00:38:41,274
bringing another lover.

364
00:38:41,841 --> 00:38:44,515
Came contours, petulant,

365
00:38:45,002 --> 00:38:47,153
with an air of provocation.

366
00:38:50,363 --> 00:38:53,275
Bringing to another lover,

367
00:38:54,123 --> 00:38:56,479
came contours, petulant,

368
00:38:57,324 --> 00:38:59,600
with an air of provocation.

369
00:39:00,805 --> 00:39:03,080
In the tavern Friagem,

370
00:39:03,525 --> 00:39:06,084
between a bunch of Fados,

371
00:39:06,565 --> 00:39:08,873
I came to them without rancor.

372
00:39:12,325 --> 00:39:15,158
Because the woman who brought

373
00:39:15,765 --> 00:39:18,326
certainly not worth

374
00:39:18,847 --> 00:39:21,076
or shade

375
00:39:21,646 --> 00:39:25,082
my love.

376
00:39:28,486 --> 00:39:31,479
Because the woman who brought

377
00:39:31,967 --> 00:39:34,528
certainly not worth

378
00:39:34,967 --> 00:39:37,562
nor the shadow of my love.

379
00:39:41,088 --> 00:39:43,921
To see who had more verve

380
00:39:44,489 --> 00:39:46,845
sing a challenge

381
00:39:47,449 --> 00:39:49,883
this one and me.

382
00:39:53,290 --> 00:39:56,487
I left it up to the bitumen,

383
00:39:56,890 --> 00:39:59,688
showing more fado,

384
00:39:59,930 --> 00:40:02,683
proving to be more women.

385
00:40:05,611 --> 00:40:08,843
I left it up to the bitumen,

386
00:40:09,211 --> 00:40:11,851
showing more fado,

387
00:40:12,452 --> 00:40:14,647
proving to be more women.

388
00:41:32,060 --> 00:41:34,175
It was one of those scenes,

389
00:41:34,420 --> 00:41:36,854
among many others in my life,

390
00:41:37,339 --> 00:41:40,332
of which are never forgotten.

391
00:41:43,260 --> 00:41:46,094
I only know that at dawn

392
00:41:46,621 --> 00:41:49,340
when everything was finished,

393
00:41:49,782 --> 00:41:52,740
we both went home.

394
00:41:55,542 --> 00:41:58,615
I only know that at dawn

395
00:41:59,263 --> 00:42:01,983
when everything was finished,

396
00:42:02,343 --> 00:42:06,940
we both went home.

397
00:42:26,906 --> 00:42:30,375
We both went home.

398
00:42:55,829 --> 00:42:59,982
Return, life lived,

399
00:43:00,910 --> 00:43:03,788
to enable it to see again.

400
00:43:04,190 --> 00:43:08,900
Return, life lived,

401
00:43:10,030 --> 00:43:13,022
so you can see again

402
00:43:14,031 --> 00:43:17,740
one life lost

403
00:43:19,511 --> 00:43:22,709
I never knew that life.

404
00:43:24,352 --> 00:43:28,062
One life lost

405
00:43:28,553 --> 00:43:31,544
I never knew that life.

406
00:43:32,112 --> 00:43:36,390
I would not do again

407
00:43:38,313 --> 00:43:41,430
those times.
What nostalgia.

408
00:43:43,114 --> 00:43:47,266
I would not do again

409
00:43:47,794 --> 00:43:50,592
those times.
What nostalgia.

410
00:43:50,835 --> 00:43:54,908
Spring always returns,

411
00:43:56,955 --> 00:44:00,107
the only thing that does not return
is youth.

412
00:44:01,676 --> 00:44:05,112
Spring always returns

413
00:44:05,356 --> 00:44:09,110
the only thing that does not return
is youth.

414
00:44:10,356 --> 00:44:13,952
Time passes

415
00:44:15,598 --> 00:44:18,634
and we were deceived.

416
00:44:20,277 --> 00:44:23,270
Time passes

417
00:44:24,918 --> 00:44:27,956
and we were deceived,

418
00:44:30,960 --> 00:44:33,028
Now laughing,

419
00:44:36,599 --> 00:44:37,509
Now crying.

420
00:44:39,520 --> 00:44:42,114
Now crying,
Now laughing.

421
00:44:44,240 --> 00:44:47,677
Now laughing,
Now crying.

422
00:44:48,081 --> 00:44:51,198
Now crying,
Now laughing.

423
00:44:52,640 --> 00:44:55,757
"My God, how time passes,"

424
00:44:58,001 --> 00:45:00,674
say from time to time.

425
00:45:02,521 --> 00:45:05,195
"My God, how time passes,"

426
00:45:07,162 --> 00:45:10,518
say from time to time.

427
00:45:11,683 --> 00:45:14,198
In the end,

428
00:45:17,044 --> 00:45:20,036
is the time that remains,

429
00:45:21,404 --> 00:45:24,794
and people going past.

430
00:45:27,085 --> 00:45:29,758
In the end, is the time
that is,

431
00:45:30,126 --> 00:45:33,834
and people going past.

432
00:48:45,025 --> 00:48:47,380
Have known

433
00:48:48,145 --> 00:48:51,138
they were going to die young

434
00:48:51,906 --> 00:48:54,979
I would never have loved

435
00:48:55,507 --> 00:48:58,418
anybody in this world.

436
00:48:58,986 --> 00:49:01,864
Have known

437
00:49:02,907 --> 00:49:05,500
they were going to die young

438
00:49:06,627 --> 00:49:09,062
I would never have loved

439
00:49:10,307 --> 00:49:13,027
anybody in this world.

440
00:49:14,709 --> 00:49:16,824
This dance

441
00:49:17,308 --> 00:49:20,745
is the dream of my hope

442
00:49:21,229 --> 00:49:23,663
it has taught me

443
00:49:24,590 --> 00:49:27,502
your love was false

444
00:49:27,790 --> 00:49:29,269
flower.

445
00:49:29,590 --> 00:49:31,582
This dance

446
00:49:32,070 --> 00:49:35,063
is the dream of my hope

447
00:49:35,911 --> 00:49:38,505
it has taught me

448
00:49:39,311 --> 00:49:42,109
your love was false

449
00:49:42,271 --> 00:49:43,671
flower.

450
00:49:44,072 --> 00:49:46,380
At the farewell

451
00:49:47,310 --> 00:49:50,145
cry a lot.

452
00:49:51,351 --> 00:49:53,819
That hurt

453
00:49:54,272 --> 00:49:57,344
and I cried too.

454
00:50:14,234 --> 00:50:16,429
This dance

455
00:50:16,675 --> 00:50:19,986
is the dream of my hope

456
00:50:20,315 --> 00:50:22,830
it has taught me

457
00:50:23,676 --> 00:50:26,510
faso was your love,

458
00:50:26,677 --> 00:50:28,315
flower.

459
00:51:12,761 --> 00:51:14,911
At the farewell

460
00:51:16,121 --> 00:51:18,761
cry a lot.

461
00:51:20,042 --> 00:51:22,112
That hurt

462
00:51:22,843 --> 00:51:25,561
and I cried too.

463
00:51:42,803 --> 00:51:44,600
This dance

464
00:51:45,083 --> 00:51:48,156
is the dream of my hope

465
00:51:48,884 --> 00:51:51,524
it has taught me

466
00:51:52,325 --> 00:51:55,123
your love was false

467
00:51:55,285 --> 00:51:56,605
my flower.

468
00:52:37,129 --> 00:52:39,883
Love, when shown,

469
00:52:40,611 --> 00:52:43,488
it is not known to display.

470
00:52:51,050 --> 00:52:54,088
He knows how to look

471
00:52:54,971 --> 00:52:57,769
but not knowing how to talk.

472
00:53:05,772 --> 00:53:09,163
Who wants to say what he feels

473
00:53:09,493 --> 00:53:12,485
do not know what to say.

474
00:53:20,174 --> 00:53:22,848
If he speaks, it seems that lying.

475
00:53:23,654 --> 00:53:26,328
If shut, it seems to forget.

476
00:53:34,536 --> 00:53:37,609
Oh, if she guessed,

477
00:53:38,777 --> 00:53:41,655
if I could hear the eyes ...

478
00:53:48,377 --> 00:53:51,607
And if you look enough

479
00:53:52,096 --> 00:53:55,248
to know
that are loving ...

480
00:54:03,338 --> 00:54:06,809
But I feel much, shut up.

481
00:54:07,099 --> 00:54:11,059
Who wants to say
what you feel

482
00:54:17,020 --> 00:54:20,218
remains without a soul,

483
00:54:23,901 --> 00:54:25,493
speechless,

484
00:54:25,901 --> 00:54:28,654
and totally alone.

485
00:54:51,984 --> 00:54:55,738
It was in the dry
wild leaves.

486
00:54:56,184 --> 00:54:58,857
Who put you that name.

487
00:54:59,024 --> 00:55:00,901
Soledad,

488
00:55:01,184 --> 00:55:03,379
loneliness.

489
00:55:04,264 --> 00:55:08,657
He knows what words are

490
00:55:11,946 --> 00:55:17,066
before they put the sun.

491
00:55:18,587 --> 00:55:21,624
As a dream of agony ...

492
00:55:22,147 --> 00:55:25,697
These eyes of mine.

493
00:55:26,548 --> 00:55:29,107
Soledad,

494
00:55:30,787 --> 00:55:32,300
Little India.

495
00:55:32,468 --> 00:55:34,743
Is it so fast? Do not stop?

496
00:55:39,509 --> 00:55:41,022
Little Indian.

497
00:55:43,989 --> 00:55:46,867
Little Indian.

498
00:55:51,150 --> 00:55:54,859
In ash soil
abandoned.

499
00:55:55,350 --> 00:55:57,910
What do you think?
Do not think anything.

500
00:55:58,190 --> 00:56:01,307
Soledad,
loneliness.

501
00:56:05,511 --> 00:56:09,790
Life is totally secret

502
00:56:12,672 --> 00:56:14,425
as the stars

503
00:56:15,553 --> 00:56:19,431
like the stars
in these ashes.

504
00:56:21,392 --> 00:56:23,748
As the stars

505
00:56:23,913 --> 00:56:26,951
like the stars
in these ashes.

506
00:56:28,513 --> 00:56:31,824
Before they let the sun ...

507
00:56:37,155 --> 00:56:39,271
Soledad.

508
00:56:39,516 --> 00:56:42,507
Soledad.

509
00:56:50,596 --> 00:56:52,666
- This is wrong here?
- Not very well.

510
00:56:54,996 --> 00:56:56,988
Well

511
00:56:57,917 --> 00:57:00,954
only he would explain

512
00:57:02,357 --> 00:57:05,475
who serves your destination

513
00:57:05,798 --> 00:57:09,267
without penalty and without joy.

514
00:57:11,798 --> 00:57:15,837
Your heart is so big ...

515
00:57:55,043 --> 00:57:59,594
very nice too ...

516
00:58:48,648 --> 00:58:55,964
It is by God's will

517
00:59:01,849 --> 00:59:06,799
I live in anxiety,

518
00:59:11,451 --> 00:59:15,888
cries are all mine,

519
00:59:16,411 --> 00:59:20,803
and all my nostalgia.

520
00:59:22,252 --> 00:59:24,972
It is by God's will.

521
00:59:30,133 --> 00:59:37,562
What a strange way of life

522
00:59:43,294 --> 00:59:47,208
have this heart of mine.

523
00:59:52,295 --> 00:59:56,049
Lives lost in life,

524
00:59:56,615 --> 01:00:00,005
Who would you give this gift?

525
01:00:00,856 --> 01:00:04,133
What a strange way of life.

526
01:00:08,577 --> 01:00:13,287
Celebrities independent

527
01:00:17,578 --> 01:00:22,607
heart that does not control,

528
01:00:26,259 --> 01:00:30,571
lives lost among the people

529
01:00:30,819 --> 01:00:35,097
stubbornly bleeding,

530
01:00:36,179 --> 01:00:39,297
heart independent.

531
01:00:43,541 --> 01:00:48,217
I do not already over,

532
01:00:52,502 --> 01:00:56,461
order to stop beating,

533
01:01:01,262 --> 01:01:06,542
if you do not know

534
01:01:08,824 --> 01:01:11,384
where to go,

535
01:01:12,424 --> 01:01:15,893
Why insist on running?

536
01:01:16,303 --> 01:01:20,376
I do not already over.

537
01:01:53,708 --> 01:01:57,418
Grândola, brown village,

538
01:01:58,229 --> 01:02:02,858
land of brotherhood.

539
01:02:05,308 --> 01:02:09,268
The village is in charge

540
01:02:10,229 --> 01:02:13,700
inside you, oh city. 

541
01:02:15,390 --> 01:02:18,666
Inside you, oh city.

542
01:02:19,871 --> 01:02:24,626
The village is in charge,

543
01:02:27,431 --> 01:02:31,186
land of brotherhood.

544
01:02:31,951 --> 01:02:35,024
Grândola, brown village.

545
01:02:50,634 --> 01:02:53,592
Oh, my muse fado,

546
01:02:54,194 --> 01:02:57,028
oh, my gracious mother.

547
01:02:57,753 --> 01:03:00,223
I leave you, shocked,

548
01:03:00,554 --> 01:03:02,784
the first of April.

549
01:03:04,995 --> 01:03:08,227
Do not be so ungrateful,

550
01:03:08,436 --> 01:03:11,472
do not forget who I love you

551
01:03:12,156 --> 01:03:16,866
and who in your dense jungle
lost and found.

552
01:03:19,437 --> 01:03:24,227
This land still
will meet his ideal,

553
01:03:26,638 --> 01:03:30,711
will become yet
in a vast Portugal.

554
01:03:33,919 --> 01:03:35,147
You know?

555
01:03:35,319 --> 01:03:37,311
Basically I am a sentimental.

556
01:03:38,240 --> 01:03:42,232
All the inherited blood
Lusitanian a good dose of lyricism.

557
01:03:42,478 --> 01:03:44,231
In addition to syphilis, of course.

558
01:03:45,079 --> 01:03:47,639
Although my hands are busy

559
01:03:47,800 --> 01:03:51,156
torturing, drowning, degollando,

560
01:03:51,841 --> 01:03:55,799
close your eyes my heart
and sincerely mourned.

561
01:04:16,643 --> 01:04:19,077
With Culantrillo in the scrub,

562
01:04:19,684 --> 01:04:22,118
rosemary in the reedbed,

563
01:04:23,084 --> 01:04:25,359
liquors in the Moringa,

564
01:04:25,644 --> 01:04:27,635
came a tropical

565
01:04:30,204 --> 01:04:33,277
and the beautiful mulata

566
01:04:33,564 --> 01:04:36,477
fits with the Alentejo

567
01:04:37,165 --> 01:04:41,522
to which a bravata
stole a kiss.

568
01:04:44,365 --> 01:04:48,838
This land still
will meet his ideal,

569
01:04:51,766 --> 01:04:55,760
will become yet
in a vast Portugal.

570
01:04:59,407 --> 01:05:02,160
My heart is calm
by nature

571
01:05:02,447 --> 01:05:04,882
hit my hand
Hard and fast.

572
01:05:05,048 --> 01:05:07,437
So,
when everything is done,

573
01:05:08,168 --> 01:05:10,966
lost,
I question myself.

574
01:05:11,929 --> 01:05:13,920
If you take your hands
off my chest

575
01:05:14,089 --> 01:05:16,842
is that distance
between intention and gesture.

576
01:05:17,769 --> 01:05:20,363
And if you close with my hands
my heart

577
01:05:20,529 --> 01:05:23,168
I am surprised the sudden
sense of incest.

578
01:05:24,249 --> 01:05:26,081
In the heat of battle

579
01:05:26,250 --> 01:05:28,205
boasts a sharp grip

580
01:05:28,530 --> 01:05:30,600
but my chest is opened.

581
01:05:31,370 --> 01:05:33,726
And if the ruling
announces brutal,

582
01:05:33,931 --> 01:05:36,206
quickly
Blind runs his hand,

583
01:05:36,731 --> 01:05:39,326
because if not,
forgiving heart.

584
01:05:40,092 --> 01:05:42,606
Guitars and zanfona,

585
01:05:43,052 --> 01:05:46,329
jasmine,
coconut trees and fountains,

586
01:05:47,213 --> 01:05:49,283
sardines, cassava,

587
01:05:49,612 --> 01:05:51,649
in a smooth tile.

588
01:05:53,773 --> 01:05:56,083
And the Amazon River

589
01:05:57,135 --> 01:06:00,046
traveled Trás-os-Montes

590
01:06:00,694 --> 01:06:04,733
and a large wave
flows into the Tagus.

591
01:06:07,694 --> 01:06:12,404
This land still
will meet his ideal,

592
01:06:14,535 --> 01:06:18,449
will become yet
in a vast Portugal.

593
01:06:21,336 --> 01:06:26,126
This land still
will meet his ideal,

594
01:06:28,176 --> 01:06:32,773
will become yet
in a vast Portugal.

595
01:08:47,551 --> 01:08:50,669
Me, I just miss me,

596
01:08:52,832 --> 01:08:57,030
Lady of my life,

597
01:09:00,793 --> 01:09:04,149
I say that's my dream

598
01:09:05,113 --> 01:09:08,025
and I

599
01:09:09,233 --> 01:09:11,065
by birth.

600
01:09:13,394 --> 01:09:16,671
I bring a fado song

601
01:09:17,274 --> 01:09:19,993
in my soul

602
01:09:20,915 --> 01:09:23,874
well-kept.

603
01:09:25,634 --> 01:09:29,992
Come inside my surprise

604
01:09:30,475 --> 01:09:34,104
looking

605
01:09:37,196 --> 01:09:41,269
My fado.

606
01:09:41,597 --> 01:09:44,907
My fate, my fate.

607
01:09:45,077 --> 01:09:48,228
My fate, my fate.

608
01:11:26,807 --> 01:11:29,083
A friendship lost

609
01:11:30,568 --> 01:11:32,843
can never return.

610
01:11:34,449 --> 01:11:37,122
It was a feigned friendship

611
01:11:38,129 --> 01:11:40,518
to go and play again.

612
01:11:42,010 --> 01:11:44,365
It was a feigned friendship

613
01:11:45,731 --> 01:11:48,120
to go and play again.

614
01:11:48,850 --> 01:11:50,887
Nobody gives anything

615
01:11:51,131 --> 01:11:55,647
without a change
a reward.

616
01:11:56,771 --> 01:11:59,444
Nobody gives anything

617
01:12:01,211 --> 01:12:03,772
without a change
a reward.

618
01:12:05,012 --> 01:12:07,573
Only a friend can

619
01:12:08,852 --> 01:12:11,320
love without giving.

620
01:12:12,492 --> 01:12:15,689
Only a friend can

621
01:12:16,492 --> 01:12:18,802
love without giving.

622
01:12:21,494 --> 01:12:24,691
My mother, I sing at night

623
01:12:26,654 --> 01:12:29,930
because the day I was punished.

624
01:12:31,775 --> 01:12:35,085
And in the silence of things

625
01:12:37,095 --> 01:12:40,327
I find the voice friend.

626
01:12:42,095 --> 01:12:45,452
And in the silence of things

627
01:12:47,376 --> 01:12:50,925
I find the voice friend.

628
01:12:52,776 --> 01:12:56,133
My mother, I cry at night

629
01:12:57,778 --> 01:13:01,612
this love
in which I sink.

630
01:13:02,898 --> 01:13:05,572
Because words
of life

631
01:13:08,219 --> 01:13:11,495
and no other world.

632
01:13:13,698 --> 01:13:16,736
So I am this song

633
01:13:17,419 --> 01:13:22,175
my mother, as a wound

634
01:13:24,020 --> 01:13:27,934
that seen at night in my body

635
01:13:29,341 --> 01:13:33,414
no destination, but with fado.

636
01:13:34,740 --> 01:13:38,336
That seen at night in my body

637
01:13:39,221 --> 01:13:44,011
Fado but with no destination.

638
01:13:44,542 --> 01:13:47,295
Maybe I read fado

639
01:13:47,583 --> 01:13:51,098
what I mean nobody.

640
01:13:51,744 --> 01:13:55,053
And we pursue,

641
01:13:55,463 --> 01:13:59,252
to hear him.

642
01:13:59,584 --> 01:14:03,134
And we Pursuing

643
01:14:03,345 --> 01:14:06,895
to hear him.

644
01:14:08,385 --> 01:14:11,263
My love has sung

645
01:14:11,506 --> 01:14:15,293
under heaven so superior.

646
01:14:15,665 --> 01:14:19,215
Because I gave
each fado

647
01:14:19,386 --> 01:14:22,661
as if it were the first.

648
01:14:24,066 --> 01:14:26,979
Perhaps I did not ask fado

649
01:14:27,186 --> 01:14:30,383
everything that I,

650
01:14:31,266 --> 01:14:34,623
therefore, even if I forget,

651
01:14:35,467 --> 01:14:39,017
he does not forget who I am.

652
01:14:39,348 --> 01:14:42,420
So even if I forget,

653
01:14:42,948 --> 01:14:45,702
he does not forget who I am.

654
01:14:49,670 --> 01:14:52,945
Not to see you cry

655
01:14:53,309 --> 01:14:56,347
and see you cry now.

656
01:14:56,910 --> 01:15:00,028
Not to see you cry

657
01:15:01,271 --> 01:15:04,423
and see you cry now.

658
01:15:04,951 --> 01:15:08,183
For wanting stronger,

659
01:15:08,432 --> 01:15:11,901
want to see you at all times.

660
01:15:12,391 --> 01:15:16,066
Flying over time

661
01:15:16,791 --> 01:15:20,182
when you talk and I listen.

662
01:15:20,551 --> 01:15:23,988
But the hours of our life

663
01:15:24,872 --> 01:15:28,183
each have one minute.

664
01:15:28,553 --> 01:15:31,626
Permítete be at my side

665
01:15:32,274 --> 01:15:35,550
and not ever go again,

666
01:15:36,234 --> 01:15:39,590
for my heart,
poor,

667
01:15:40,075 --> 01:15:43,829
living in a life time.

668
01:15:44,315 --> 01:15:47,353
For my heart,
poor,

669
01:15:48,036 --> 01:15:51,233
living in a life time.

670
01:17:50,247 --> 01:17:52,398
I am not afraid to fame,

671
01:17:52,809 --> 01:17:55,607
Alfama with bad reputation.

672
01:17:57,089 --> 01:18:00,002
I am not afraid to fame,

673
01:18:00,489 --> 01:18:02,639
Alfama with bad reputation.

674
01:18:03,890 --> 01:18:06,358
Fame sometimes defamed

675
01:18:06,570 --> 01:18:09,483
Good people, honest people.

676
01:18:10,731 --> 01:18:13,165
Fame sometimes defamed

677
01:18:13,411 --> 01:18:16,289
Good people, honest people.

678
01:18:17,532 --> 01:18:19,839
Fado, come with me,

679
01:18:20,691 --> 01:18:23,365
fado hear this from the street.

680
01:18:24,212 --> 01:18:26,849
Fado, come with me,

681
01:18:27,971 --> 01:18:29,803
fado hear this from the street.

682
01:18:30,571 --> 01:18:33,245
And sing desafiándoos

683
01:18:33,692 --> 01:18:37,207
in a typical old town.

684
01:18:38,333 --> 01:18:40,926
And sing desafiándoos

685
01:18:41,093 --> 01:18:43,926
in a typical old town.

686
01:18:44,134 --> 01:18:47,922
Come on, as I said,

687
01:18:48,814 --> 01:18:51,010
you have to do at dawn

688
01:18:51,775 --> 01:18:55,130
how good was that the evening

689
01:18:55,655 --> 01:18:57,930
in the old Alfama district.

690
01:18:59,135 --> 01:19:01,491
I am not afraid to fame

691
01:19:01,776 --> 01:19:04,734
Alfama with the bad reputation.

692
01:19:06,056 --> 01:19:08,696
I am not afraid to fame

693
01:19:08,857 --> 01:19:11,655
Alfama with the bad reputation.

694
01:19:12,417 --> 01:19:15,409
I know that the world was talking,

695
01:19:15,657 --> 01:19:18,774
and true evil.

696
01:19:19,498 --> 01:19:22,614
I know that the world was talking,

697
01:19:22,777 --> 01:19:25,291
and true evil.

698
01:19:26,018 --> 01:19:29,054
So it was not always true

699
01:19:29,498 --> 01:19:32,251
what they were.

700
01:19:33,578 --> 01:19:36,252
So it was not always true

701
01:19:36,459 --> 01:19:39,257
what they were.

702
01:19:39,659 --> 01:19:43,209
Many people there wore

703
01:19:44,179 --> 01:19:47,059
a very quiet life

704
01:19:47,500 --> 01:19:50,573
a form of evil

705
01:19:50,980 --> 01:19:53,177
was dotted with mud.

706
01:19:53,342 --> 01:19:57,415
Fame

707
01:19:58,542 --> 01:20:02,092
sometimes defamed

708
01:20:02,303 --> 01:20:05,772
Good people, honest people.

709
01:20:06,582 --> 01:20:09,222
Fame sometimes defamed

710
01:20:09,383 --> 01:20:12,261
Good people, honest people.

711
01:20:18,303 --> 01:20:22,092
Fado this is mine and yours,

712
01:20:26,504 --> 01:20:30,213
a destiny that bind us

713
01:20:34,305 --> 01:20:38,059
while it is denied

714
01:20:43,027 --> 01:20:46,018
the strings of a guitar.

715
01:20:51,707 --> 01:20:54,938
Whenever you hear the wail

716
01:20:59,428 --> 01:21:02,784
a guitar playing

717
01:21:07,829 --> 01:21:11,822
we feel lost

718
01:21:16,110 --> 01:21:19,740
who want to mourn.

719
01:21:25,390 --> 01:21:29,542
Oh, people of my land,

720
01:21:33,391 --> 01:21:36,508
Now I come to realize

721
01:21:41,032 --> 01:21:45,503
I feel sad that this

722
01:21:49,433 --> 01:21:52,982
The received from you.

723
01:21:58,794 --> 01:22:01,911
And it would seem tenderness

724
01:22:06,395 --> 01:22:10,468
if I leave Acuña.

725
01:22:14,436 --> 01:22:18,827
It would be more bitterness,

726
01:22:19,437 --> 01:22:25,831
I sing less sad.

727
01:22:31,917 --> 01:22:36,115
Oh, people of my land,

728
01:22:39,877 --> 01:22:43,268
Now I come to realize

729
01:22:47,639 --> 01:22:52,873
sadness that I feel

730
01:22:56,000 --> 01:23:01,837
The received from you.
