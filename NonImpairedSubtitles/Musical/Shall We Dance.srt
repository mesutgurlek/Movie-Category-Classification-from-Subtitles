1
00:02:46,399 --> 00:02:48,390
Stop that. Why, the idea.

2
00:02:48,468 --> 00:02:50,766
<i>Voulez-vous</i> me to call the police?

3
00:02:56,910 --> 00:03:01,404
-What does that mean in English?
-The same as it does in French, <i>monsieur,</i>

4
00:03:10,290 --> 00:03:11,621
All right.

5
00:03:12,759 --> 00:03:14,659
C<i>omme ca,</i> a little brook.

6
00:03:14,761 --> 00:03:16,490
C<i>omme ca,</i> a little river.

7
00:03:16,563 --> 00:03:19,396
C<i>omme ca,</i> a little brook.

8
00:03:19,499 --> 00:03:21,524
C<i>omme ca,</i> a little river.

9
00:03:21,601 --> 00:03:23,193
Where is Petrov?

10
00:03:23,469 --> 00:03:26,700
Please, can you not see
l am busy being a wave?

11
00:03:26,773 --> 00:03:31,437
C<i>omme ca,</i> a little river,
<i>comme ca,</i> a little brook.

12
00:03:35,348 --> 00:03:36,940
Where is Petrov?

13
00:03:42,255 --> 00:03:45,088
Look here, l don't want to be bourgeois
and remind anybody...

14
00:03:45,158 --> 00:03:46,750
that l'm the owner of this company...

15
00:03:46,826 --> 00:03:49,021
but if somebody doesn't tell me
where Petrov is...

16
00:03:49,095 --> 00:03:50,494
there'll be trouble for everybody.

17
00:03:50,563 --> 00:03:52,895
He's in his private room,
practicing his grand leap.

18
00:03:52,966 --> 00:03:54,024
Thank you.

19
00:03:54,100 --> 00:03:56,933
-But he does not want to be disturbed.
-Thank you.

20
00:04:04,277 --> 00:04:06,575
-What is this?
-Hi, Jeff.

21
00:04:13,052 --> 00:04:16,021
Stop it. Stop that.

22
00:04:18,491 --> 00:04:21,756
-What on earth are you doing?
-l'm just having fun.

23
00:04:24,430 --> 00:04:27,331
Fun? The great Petrov
doesn't dance for fun.

24
00:04:27,734 --> 00:04:29,531
The great Petrov doesn't, but l do.

25
00:04:29,602 --> 00:04:33,299
-Pete Peters, remember me?
-Oh, that awful name of yours.

26
00:04:33,506 --> 00:04:37,943
l was born with it. lt isn't bad.
Pete Peters, Philadelphia, PA.

27
00:04:40,613 --> 00:04:42,342
How do you make
that exasperating noise?

28
00:04:42,415 --> 00:04:44,144
What have you got on those shoes?

29
00:04:44,217 --> 00:04:45,616
-Taps.
-Taps?

30
00:04:47,153 --> 00:04:49,781
-On your ballet shoes?
-Sure.

31
00:04:49,856 --> 00:04:52,450
Sacrilege. At last l'm beginning
to understand...

32
00:04:52,525 --> 00:04:54,322
why you wanted a private room
to dance in.

33
00:04:54,394 --> 00:04:57,124
All this time l thought you were practicing
your grand leap.

34
00:04:57,196 --> 00:04:59,096
But, Jeff, l haven't neglected anything.

35
00:04:59,165 --> 00:05:01,190
Look, the entre chat trois.

36
00:05:05,538 --> 00:05:07,335
Lovely, beautiful.

37
00:05:07,407 --> 00:05:10,240
But how much more effective
it is this way.

38
00:05:14,213 --> 00:05:16,738
Lovely.... l forbid that.

39
00:05:16,949 --> 00:05:18,849
-That's not art.
-Maybe it isn't.

40
00:05:18,918 --> 00:05:21,716
Perhaps it's just the Philadelphia in me.

41
00:05:21,988 --> 00:05:24,821
Jeff, l wish we could combine
the technique of the ballet...

42
00:05:24,891 --> 00:05:27,416
with the warmth and passion
of this other mood.

43
00:05:27,493 --> 00:05:30,257
Mood, what other mood?
You mean this jazz business?

44
00:05:30,330 --> 00:05:32,890
Jazz went out with the flapper.
That isn't jazz.

45
00:05:32,965 --> 00:05:34,865
After 15 years of the hardest work...

46
00:05:34,934 --> 00:05:36,697
you want to dwindle
into a shimmy dancer.

47
00:05:36,769 --> 00:05:38,066
Well, forget all that nonsense.

48
00:05:38,137 --> 00:05:40,765
Here, look at this, do you realize
we ought to be sailing?

49
00:05:40,840 --> 00:05:44,003
Do you realize the Metropolitan
in New York City is getting nervous?

50
00:05:44,077 --> 00:05:46,602
l'm sorry, but l have to stay in Paris
a while yet.

51
00:05:46,679 --> 00:05:49,671
Stay in Paris? What for? Why?

52
00:05:50,817 --> 00:05:52,944
That's grace, that's rhythm.

53
00:05:53,252 --> 00:05:55,743
What is that? What have you got there?

54
00:06:01,894 --> 00:06:03,521
lsn't she lovely?

55
00:06:05,198 --> 00:06:06,825
lsn't she lovely?

56
00:06:08,034 --> 00:06:09,058
So that's it.

57
00:06:09,135 --> 00:06:11,501
Who is that girl? Who is she?
Where did you meet her?

58
00:06:11,571 --> 00:06:13,630
That's it, l haven't been able
to meet her yet.

59
00:06:13,706 --> 00:06:15,367
But l hope to dance with her someday.

60
00:06:15,441 --> 00:06:17,466
-Dance? With her?
-Sure.

61
00:06:17,543 --> 00:06:18,669
Are you mad?

62
00:06:18,745 --> 00:06:21,908
Are you sure that she hasn't tried
to persuade you to stay on here?

63
00:06:21,981 --> 00:06:26,247
l told you, l haven't even met her,
but l'd kind of like to marry her.

64
00:06:27,954 --> 00:06:29,319
l think l will.

65
00:06:29,389 --> 00:06:30,856
Thanks, Jeff.

66
00:07:09,662 --> 00:07:11,459
You are so beautiful when you are angry.

67
00:07:11,531 --> 00:07:13,999
<i>Pardon, mademoiselle,</i>
l cannot help what l cannot help.

68
00:07:14,066 --> 00:07:15,556
Neither can l.

69
00:07:19,739 --> 00:07:21,570
You cannot let us up like this.

70
00:07:21,641 --> 00:07:26,203
-lt not up she let us, it is down.
-Up or down, she lets us.

71
00:07:26,679 --> 00:07:29,807
-lt is all your fault, you kissed her.
-But it is in the play.

72
00:07:29,882 --> 00:07:31,543
You kissed her out of the play, too.

73
00:07:31,617 --> 00:07:33,380
Go home, all of you.

74
00:07:34,220 --> 00:07:35,448
Go home!

75
00:07:45,932 --> 00:07:49,368
Well, hello, my little darling.
What have you got there?

76
00:07:49,535 --> 00:07:52,902
lt's Mr. Miller, miss.
He just arrived from New York.

77
00:07:59,579 --> 00:08:01,706
-Hello, Arthur.
-Hello, Lynn.

78
00:08:04,617 --> 00:08:06,107
You better go.

79
00:08:06,819 --> 00:08:08,912
lf l ever walk on a stage again....

80
00:08:08,988 --> 00:08:11,456
-How did you get here?
-By rail.

81
00:08:11,924 --> 00:08:14,119
l hung over every inch of it.

82
00:08:14,660 --> 00:08:18,221
A new experience for you,
you usually have your foot on one.

83
00:08:18,297 --> 00:08:19,628
Yes, Lynn.

84
00:08:19,899 --> 00:08:22,265
Of all the humiliating experiences.

85
00:08:22,335 --> 00:08:24,803
Did you ever dance with a man
you didn't care about...

86
00:08:24,871 --> 00:08:27,465
-and who's in love with you?
-No, Lynn.

87
00:08:27,607 --> 00:08:31,134
Why do actors have to take
the author's lines literally?

88
00:08:31,277 --> 00:08:34,542
And why must there always be a kiss
at the second-act curtain?

89
00:08:34,614 --> 00:08:38,072
As long as l live, l hope l never see
another hand-kissing, heel-clicker.

90
00:08:38,150 --> 00:08:39,344
Careful, Lynn.

91
00:08:39,418 --> 00:08:42,717
You know, l come from a long line
of heels myself...

92
00:08:42,822 --> 00:08:44,790
but we've never clicked.

93
00:08:44,924 --> 00:08:46,516
And it's all your fault, too.

94
00:08:46,592 --> 00:08:49,959
l was a happy, peaceful girl
until you discovered me.

95
00:08:50,363 --> 00:08:52,160
Fame, name in lights.

96
00:08:52,532 --> 00:08:54,693
l never should have listened to you.

97
00:08:54,767 --> 00:08:56,098
l'll quit.

98
00:08:58,371 --> 00:09:01,272
-l'll retire from the stage forever.
-Again?

99
00:09:02,141 --> 00:09:04,439
lt does you good to break an engagement.

100
00:09:04,510 --> 00:09:05,841
Engagement?

101
00:09:05,912 --> 00:09:08,745
Engagement. That's what l'll do, Tai.

102
00:09:10,950 --> 00:09:12,281
Send a cable to Jim Montgomery.

103
00:09:12,351 --> 00:09:14,182
Tell him l want to see him desperately...

104
00:09:14,253 --> 00:09:16,312
and l'm coming back
on the <i>Queen Anne</i> tomorrow.

105
00:09:16,389 --> 00:09:18,516
-Yes, miss.
-Now, Lynn, don't lose your head.

106
00:09:18,591 --> 00:09:20,525
-You have to stay in the theatre.
-Never.

107
00:09:20,593 --> 00:09:22,720
l refuse to be a bowl in a gold of fish.

108
00:09:22,795 --> 00:09:24,854
You mean a fish in a bowl of gold.

109
00:09:24,931 --> 00:09:27,365
That's what l said, a bowl in a goldfish.

110
00:09:27,433 --> 00:09:29,867
-Just a moment, please.
-Thank you.

111
00:09:37,376 --> 00:09:40,140
Petrov? What's a Petrov?

112
00:09:42,982 --> 00:09:45,644
Just the Russian ballet's greatest dancer.

113
00:09:45,718 --> 00:09:48,619
Fine, tell him to go back to Moscow.

114
00:09:48,788 --> 00:09:51,882
The gentleman seems very anxious
to see you, miss.

115
00:09:51,958 --> 00:09:55,189
l've got enough troubles
without adding a dizzy Russian to them.

116
00:09:55,261 --> 00:09:57,627
Just another dancer to swoon in my arms.

117
00:09:57,697 --> 00:10:01,565
That's all l need to make things perfect.
A simpering toe dancer.

118
00:10:03,202 --> 00:10:04,430
Get rid of him.

119
00:10:04,503 --> 00:10:07,165
He probably only wants to say
he's seen a picture of me...

120
00:10:07,239 --> 00:10:09,264
and can't live without me.

121
00:10:26,792 --> 00:10:29,192
l am Petrov.

122
00:10:29,929 --> 00:10:31,954
Charmed. l'm Linda....

123
00:10:32,632 --> 00:10:34,998
-Linda....
-Linda Keene.

124
00:10:35,167 --> 00:10:36,930
-Yes.
-How do you do?

125
00:10:42,008 --> 00:10:44,772
So glad you came, Mr. Petrov.

126
00:10:44,844 --> 00:10:47,540
Not mister, Petrov, alone.

127
00:10:48,414 --> 00:10:51,247
-Just Petrov.
-And why not?

128
00:10:51,550 --> 00:10:55,850
Just Caesar, just Napoleon,
and only Garbo...

129
00:10:55,921 --> 00:10:58,116
so Petrov, too, she's enough.

130
00:11:00,192 --> 00:11:01,853
Just about enough.

131
00:11:02,228 --> 00:11:05,994
And you, l understand
you want to dance with me.

132
00:11:06,532 --> 00:11:08,864
Of course, l cannot blame you...

133
00:11:09,468 --> 00:11:11,800
but l will not permit it.

134
00:11:13,906 --> 00:11:15,601
Who told you that?

135
00:11:16,976 --> 00:11:19,843
A little bird she tell me so.

136
00:11:23,883 --> 00:11:25,510
Not in the least.

137
00:11:26,118 --> 00:11:29,849
What, you do not want to dance
with the great Petrov?

138
00:11:30,322 --> 00:11:32,882
Don't be a silly horse.

139
00:11:35,928 --> 00:11:39,625
Maybe you could twist for me once...

140
00:11:40,466 --> 00:11:41,694
like so.

141
00:11:44,070 --> 00:11:45,867
No, l don't....

142
00:11:46,038 --> 00:11:49,337
-Twist.
-Better twist.

143
00:11:57,416 --> 00:12:00,146
Get up, l hate these discords.

144
00:12:00,386 --> 00:12:02,251
She is horrible, <i>nyet?</i>

145
00:12:02,521 --> 00:12:04,751
Well, that kind of settles it.

146
00:12:05,725 --> 00:12:08,159
With me, nothing is settled.

147
00:12:08,994 --> 00:12:12,122
Well, l must go now. l must go to Moscow.

148
00:12:13,566 --> 00:12:15,534
-Funny, <i>nyet?</i>
-Very.

149
00:12:16,469 --> 00:12:17,868
lt kills me.

150
00:12:28,681 --> 00:12:31,912
That lunatic's dangerous,
they ought to lock him up.

151
00:12:31,984 --> 00:12:34,851
Am l glad l'm sailing
on the <i>Queen Anne</i> tomorrow.

152
00:12:37,990 --> 00:12:41,619
No, Denise, no.
l can't take you back as ballerina.

153
00:12:41,694 --> 00:12:44,094
Why, you've done absolutely nothing
for four years.

154
00:12:44,163 --> 00:12:46,688
And everything's been so peaceful
since you left.

155
00:12:46,766 --> 00:12:48,358
lt wasn't my fault.

156
00:12:48,434 --> 00:12:51,665
Peter just refused to fall in love with me.

157
00:12:56,308 --> 00:12:57,832
Peter, darling.

158
00:12:58,210 --> 00:12:59,575
Why, Denise...

159
00:12:59,645 --> 00:13:02,808
-or should l say Lady Tarrington?
-No, it is Denise again.

160
00:13:02,882 --> 00:13:05,612
Denise wants to come back to the ballet.

161
00:13:05,751 --> 00:13:07,013
She does?

162
00:13:07,520 --> 00:13:09,613
Well, that sounds like fun.

163
00:13:09,722 --> 00:13:13,556
l didn't know you felt that way.
Why, of course, Denise, you're engaged.

164
00:13:13,626 --> 00:13:17,084
-You go downstairs and get your contract.
-Thank you, Jeffrey.

165
00:13:17,163 --> 00:13:19,996
Jeffrey, may l speak to you
a moment, please?

166
00:13:20,065 --> 00:13:21,657
-You'll excuse us?
-Of course.

167
00:13:21,734 --> 00:13:26,228
And l'll let you know about the rehearsals
the first thing in the morning.

168
00:13:27,907 --> 00:13:30,842
Of course, we can't give her
anything important to do at first.

169
00:13:30,910 --> 00:13:33,640
-You want me to stay, don't you?
-Why, what a question.

170
00:13:33,712 --> 00:13:36,010
-Well, then get rid of her.
-Get rid of her?

171
00:13:36,081 --> 00:13:38,311
Remember all the trouble
she caused the last time?

172
00:13:38,384 --> 00:13:41,615
-But you just told her, l heard you myself.
-l was only being polite.

173
00:13:41,687 --> 00:13:44,019
Oh dear, and l've given her my word.

174
00:13:44,089 --> 00:13:45,716
Look, Jeff, l'll make a deal with you.

175
00:13:45,791 --> 00:13:47,554
You want me to go to New York,
don't you?

176
00:13:47,626 --> 00:13:48,650
Why, naturally.

177
00:13:48,727 --> 00:13:51,821
l'll sail on the <i>Queen Anne</i> tomorrow
providing you get rid of her.

178
00:13:51,897 --> 00:13:54,627
Tomorrow, oh dear, that's so sudden.

179
00:13:54,700 --> 00:13:57,225
l wouldn't know what to do.
l wouldn't know what to say.

180
00:13:57,303 --> 00:14:00,739
-All right, l stay here in Paris.
-But l'll think of something.

181
00:14:00,806 --> 00:14:03,639
l'll connive, l'll connive something good.

182
00:14:03,909 --> 00:14:05,001
Good.

183
00:15:17,182 --> 00:15:18,342
Peter.

184
00:15:20,219 --> 00:15:21,413
Hello, Denise.

185
00:15:21,487 --> 00:15:24,547
l feel very bad
because l'm not going with you.

186
00:15:25,624 --> 00:15:28,923
-So do l.
-ls your wife going with you?

187
00:15:30,896 --> 00:15:33,296
My wife, l haven't any wife.

188
00:15:33,599 --> 00:15:37,296
Jeffrey told me it was a secret
for professional reasons.

189
00:15:37,736 --> 00:15:39,226
Oh, Jeffrey.

190
00:15:39,805 --> 00:15:42,501
Did he mention how long l'd been married?

191
00:15:42,574 --> 00:15:43,666
Yes, he did.

192
00:15:43,742 --> 00:15:47,610
lmmediately after dear Tarrington
took me away from you.

193
00:15:48,547 --> 00:15:50,139
Dear Tarrington.

194
00:15:50,883 --> 00:15:53,181
-ls she sailing with you?
-Who?

195
00:15:53,519 --> 00:15:55,646
Oh, my wife, yes, of course.

196
00:15:55,788 --> 00:15:57,585
l'd love to meet her.

197
00:15:57,790 --> 00:16:01,157
Well, you couldn't.
She's busy with the children now.

198
00:16:01,627 --> 00:16:04,061
Children? But Jeffrey didn't tell me.

199
00:16:04,129 --> 00:16:06,324
Jeffrey doesn't know everything.

200
00:16:06,398 --> 00:16:09,993
lmagine, married four years.

201
00:16:10,202 --> 00:16:11,430
lmagine.

202
00:16:11,770 --> 00:16:15,831
-And how many little ones are there?
-Five.

203
00:16:16,508 --> 00:16:19,033
-Five?
-Well, twins.

204
00:16:20,212 --> 00:16:22,680
-How wonderful.
-lsn't it?

205
00:16:22,748 --> 00:16:26,343
<i>-All visitors ashore,</i>
-Well, goodbye, Denise.

206
00:16:26,552 --> 00:16:29,146
-Sweet of you to see me off.
-Goodbye, Peter.

207
00:16:29,221 --> 00:16:30,916
<i>Bon voyage,</i>

208
00:16:39,264 --> 00:16:41,164
Miss Keene, l know,
wants me to tell you...

209
00:16:41,233 --> 00:16:43,326
how much she hates
leaving her dear Paris.

210
00:16:43,402 --> 00:16:46,838
She's enjoyed everything about it,
and everybody in it.

211
00:16:50,142 --> 00:16:52,076
<i>All visitors ashore,</i>

212
00:16:52,144 --> 00:16:54,669
<i>Monsieur</i> Petrov, a picture, please.

213
00:16:56,215 --> 00:16:57,546
Thank you.

214
00:16:58,617 --> 00:17:00,346
-One more, please.
-All right.

215
00:17:00,419 --> 00:17:03,320
l certainly do envy you, Pete,
going home at last.

216
00:17:03,389 --> 00:17:05,516
l kind of like the idea myself.

217
00:17:05,591 --> 00:17:07,991
All right, so long, fellows,
thanks for everything.

218
00:17:08,060 --> 00:17:09,288
Bye-bye.

219
00:17:13,899 --> 00:17:17,300
Miss Keene.

220
00:17:17,369 --> 00:17:19,496
Why, just Petrov.

221
00:17:19,571 --> 00:17:21,835
You come to see me go, <i>nyet?</i>

222
00:17:21,907 --> 00:17:24,273
Yes, isn't it sweet of me?

223
00:17:24,343 --> 00:17:26,470
l know you come.

224
00:17:26,545 --> 00:17:28,877
Petrov, l have been looking all over for....

225
00:17:28,947 --> 00:17:33,816
-l beg your pardon.
-Miss Keene, my friend, Jeffrey Baird.

226
00:17:35,020 --> 00:17:37,545
-How do you do?
-Really, Miss Keene....

227
00:17:37,623 --> 00:17:39,250
What did you say?

228
00:17:39,491 --> 00:17:41,220
Me? Nothing.

229
00:17:42,928 --> 00:17:45,021
What's the matter with you,
you got a cold?

230
00:17:45,097 --> 00:17:47,827
No, l feel like you say, good.

231
00:17:48,300 --> 00:17:50,962
Well, you don't sound so good.
What's the matter with you?

232
00:17:51,036 --> 00:17:53,163
Doesn't Mr. Baird understand Russian?

233
00:17:53,238 --> 00:17:54,705
-Not a--
-Yes.

234
00:17:54,773 --> 00:17:57,207
What?

235
00:18:01,146 --> 00:18:03,273
What sort of a game is this?

236
00:18:04,650 --> 00:18:07,915
lt's just a game little American boys play.

237
00:18:33,712 --> 00:18:35,509
l beg your pardon, sir.

238
00:18:35,581 --> 00:18:38,209
-We can't find Mr. Petrov.
-Well, you've got to find him.

239
00:18:38,283 --> 00:18:40,513
He's probably practicing
that jiggling somewhere.

240
00:18:40,586 --> 00:18:42,679
l've looked everywhere, sir.

241
00:18:42,754 --> 00:18:44,722
Splendid service, that's all l can say.

242
00:18:44,790 --> 00:18:47,520
Bring the world's leading ballet
dancer aboard this ship...

243
00:18:47,593 --> 00:18:50,756
and he disappears from his stateroom
under your very nose.

244
00:18:50,829 --> 00:18:53,957
Well, he might be
in someone's else's stateroom, sir.

245
00:18:54,032 --> 00:18:56,432
What would he be doing
in someone else's stateroom?

246
00:18:56,502 --> 00:18:59,130
That would be entirely up to him, sir.

247
00:24:03,141 --> 00:24:06,133
You aren't really serious
about that marriage idea, Lynn?

248
00:24:06,211 --> 00:24:07,473
No, Arthur?

249
00:24:07,546 --> 00:24:09,036
What about me?

250
00:24:09,548 --> 00:24:13,575
l'm sorry, but l'm facing real happiness
for the first time in my life.

251
00:24:13,652 --> 00:24:16,052
Yes, and l'm facing bankruptcy...

252
00:24:16,188 --> 00:24:18,418
for the third time in my life.

253
00:24:18,857 --> 00:24:20,791
-Steward, miss.
-Come in.

254
00:24:21,193 --> 00:24:22,717
l ordered lunch for us.

255
00:24:22,794 --> 00:24:25,194
You can put the table right here.

256
00:24:26,364 --> 00:24:29,822
l guess we won't be having
many more of these together.

257
00:24:30,869 --> 00:24:35,203
Lynn, l still think you're a sap
to walk out on me just to get married.

258
00:24:35,740 --> 00:24:39,141
No, l'm tired of living the kind of life
l've been leading.

259
00:24:39,211 --> 00:24:43,204
Look, Lynn, l'll give you $10,000 more
than l gave you last year.

260
00:24:43,348 --> 00:24:46,181
You don't understand,
your kind never does.

261
00:24:46,751 --> 00:24:48,719
Money, isn't everything.

262
00:24:49,221 --> 00:24:52,054
But, Lynn, after all these years together.

263
00:24:52,190 --> 00:24:54,920
Arthur, l'm tired of being pawed.

264
00:24:57,162 --> 00:24:58,789
l beg your pardon.

265
00:24:59,731 --> 00:25:01,631
My compliments, miss...

266
00:25:02,767 --> 00:25:06,362
and as for you, sir, shame.

267
00:25:16,081 --> 00:25:18,015
You misled me, you tricked me.

268
00:25:18,083 --> 00:25:20,517
You knew that she was going
to take this boat.

269
00:25:20,585 --> 00:25:23,645
l'll admit the charge and plead
in extenuation my extreme youth.

270
00:25:23,722 --> 00:25:25,883
And where have you been all day?
With that woman?

271
00:25:25,957 --> 00:25:28,152
Not that woman, Jeff. The woman.

272
00:25:28,226 --> 00:25:32,424
But l wasn't with her, and furthermore,
she hasn't left her room all day, darn it.

273
00:25:32,497 --> 00:25:34,328
Probably one of those night prowlers.

274
00:25:34,399 --> 00:25:36,333
But she's not going to prowl
too near you...

275
00:25:36,401 --> 00:25:38,733
because l intend to accompany you
all evening.

276
00:25:38,803 --> 00:25:41,533
-Good, maybe she's got a friend.
-Really?

277
00:26:00,892 --> 00:26:02,655
What's the matter, what are you doing?

278
00:26:02,727 --> 00:26:04,820
What are you weaving about like that for?

279
00:26:04,896 --> 00:26:06,386
-Weaving?
-Yes.

280
00:26:06,565 --> 00:26:07,793
l'm not weaving.

281
00:26:07,866 --> 00:26:09,356
lt's the boat.

282
00:26:09,701 --> 00:26:11,828
You mean this boat's doing that?

283
00:26:11,903 --> 00:26:14,701
Of course, it must be getting choppy out.

284
00:26:15,073 --> 00:26:16,370
Of course.

285
00:26:20,845 --> 00:26:24,872
-Why, Jeff, what's the matter?
-Nothing, l'm all right, l think.

286
00:26:26,318 --> 00:26:27,512
l guess.

287
00:26:33,992 --> 00:26:35,983
-You look terrible.
-Do l?

288
00:26:36,061 --> 00:26:40,361
Why, yes, you're all white,
sort of green, kind of yellowish.

289
00:26:41,199 --> 00:26:43,633
-Maybe you ought to go to bed.
-Maybe.

290
00:26:43,702 --> 00:26:46,034
No, maybe l better get some air.

291
00:27:44,996 --> 00:27:47,658
-Do you mind?
-Not at all.

292
00:28:00,111 --> 00:28:02,079
-What's the matter, old man?
-lt's the boat.

293
00:28:02,147 --> 00:28:04,172
The whole boat is weaving.

294
00:28:14,893 --> 00:28:16,986
There, is that better?

295
00:28:17,128 --> 00:28:19,619
l don't know, really, l don't know.

296
00:28:20,165 --> 00:28:23,066
-Straight lemon juice, please.
-l wouldn't drink that.

297
00:28:23,134 --> 00:28:24,965
-No?
-lt'll make you seasick.

298
00:28:25,570 --> 00:28:27,435
What this gentleman needs is champagne.

299
00:28:27,505 --> 00:28:30,372
Champagne? No, l've never touched
champagne in all my life.

300
00:28:30,442 --> 00:28:33,377
-l refuse to touch it.
-You can watch me, then.

301
00:28:33,445 --> 00:28:34,776
-Keep them coming.
-Yes, sir.

302
00:28:34,846 --> 00:28:36,074
Nothing.

303
00:28:39,517 --> 00:28:42,247
Tell me the truth, do l look bad to you?

304
00:28:42,921 --> 00:28:47,051
To tell you the truth,
l don't know you well to tell you the truth.

305
00:30:58,523 --> 00:31:01,788
Miss Keene, you remember the night
we met in Paris?

306
00:31:03,061 --> 00:31:06,155
Yes, l remember.

307
00:31:08,032 --> 00:31:09,397
Wait a minute, please.

308
00:31:09,467 --> 00:31:13,597
l want to explain.
You see, l once saw a photograph of you...

309
00:31:13,671 --> 00:31:17,129
and l decided right then and there
that l simply had to meet you.

310
00:31:17,208 --> 00:31:19,335
And l tried every way but...

311
00:31:19,444 --> 00:31:21,503
nobody in Paris
seemed to know you and....

312
00:31:21,579 --> 00:31:24,070
Everybody in Paris knows Linda Keene...

313
00:31:24,148 --> 00:31:26,116
everybody worth knowing.

314
00:31:28,486 --> 00:31:33,423
Of course, but l just don't seem
to know the right people yet.

315
00:31:34,659 --> 00:31:37,594
Couldn't you do something about that
right now...

316
00:31:37,662 --> 00:31:39,653
as one Yankee to another?

317
00:31:41,866 --> 00:31:43,595
l'm from the South.

318
00:31:46,638 --> 00:31:48,629
Maybe you all's from the North.

319
00:31:51,209 --> 00:31:54,667
lt's funny, dogs have an instinct
for the right people.

320
00:31:57,382 --> 00:31:59,179
How do you like that?

321
00:32:13,364 --> 00:32:17,164
lt's marvelous how you can do it
with so many at one time.

322
00:32:20,471 --> 00:32:22,701
-Let's drink to that.
-Steward.

323
00:32:22,874 --> 00:32:25,069
Another bottle of this lemon.

324
00:32:27,845 --> 00:32:32,145
He's gone to bed, must be late.
What time is it?

325
00:32:39,557 --> 00:32:41,548
What does your watch say?

326
00:32:47,966 --> 00:32:50,127
lt says tick-tick-tick.

327
00:32:56,574 --> 00:32:58,041
Hey, Jeffrey.

328
00:32:59,410 --> 00:33:03,005
Hello, good morning.

329
00:33:09,354 --> 00:33:11,982
What's the matter, you lose something?

330
00:33:16,527 --> 00:33:20,588
l got great news for you, old man,
you're not going to be seasick.

331
00:33:22,967 --> 00:33:27,336
The captain just told me this will continue
to be the smoothest trip in 10 years.

332
00:33:27,405 --> 00:33:29,532
l don't see why you should
have such a big head.

333
00:33:29,607 --> 00:33:32,735
-You only had one glass.
-Yes, but you kept filling it.

334
00:33:32,810 --> 00:33:34,141
Your breakfast, sir.

335
00:33:34,212 --> 00:33:35,907
What'll l do?

336
00:33:35,980 --> 00:33:39,780
Before you do anything,
you'd better put that breakfast away.

337
00:33:54,332 --> 00:33:56,562
That'll save me an extra trip.

338
00:35:30,094 --> 00:35:31,823
Come here, darling.

339
00:35:32,230 --> 00:35:33,822
What has happened?

340
00:35:34,265 --> 00:35:37,826
You ruined your sweater,
now l'll have to fix it.

341
00:35:47,845 --> 00:35:50,814
lsn't it wonderful
being here tonight like this?

342
00:35:50,882 --> 00:35:53,043
Still on the same boat together.

343
00:35:53,117 --> 00:35:56,086
l seldom change boats in mid-ocean.

344
00:35:56,621 --> 00:35:58,589
l mean, look how lucky l am.

345
00:35:58,656 --> 00:36:01,648
The first time l find myself on a boat
with somebody like you...

346
00:36:01,726 --> 00:36:04,354
it turns out to be you.

347
00:37:23,441 --> 00:37:25,409
Fellows, listen to this.

348
00:37:27,411 --> 00:37:30,710
''Lady Tarrington left this morning
on the <i>S,S, Marseilles,,,</i>

349
00:37:30,781 --> 00:37:34,774
''for a trip to America to visit her friends
Mr. and Mrs. Petrov...

350
00:37:34,852 --> 00:37:37,377
''who are aboard the <i>S,S, Queen Anne,</i>

351
00:37:37,588 --> 00:37:39,385
''Upon further questioning...

352
00:37:39,457 --> 00:37:43,393
''it was learned that the Petrovs
have been married for some time...

353
00:37:43,461 --> 00:37:48,228
''their marriage not having heretofore
been disclosed for professional reasons.''

354
00:37:48,532 --> 00:37:50,523
That is news for your morning bulletin.

355
00:37:50,601 --> 00:37:54,765
That must be the musical comedy star
he's with so much, Linda Keene.

356
00:37:55,373 --> 00:37:57,204
By George, you're right.

357
00:37:57,275 --> 00:38:01,439
Sparks just told me that ballet dancer,
Petrov, is secretly married.

358
00:38:02,113 --> 00:38:05,446
-l'll wager it's to that American dancer.
-Righto.

359
00:38:06,751 --> 00:38:10,050
-Will that be all, Miss Linda?
-Yes, thank you, Tai.

360
00:38:15,026 --> 00:38:18,086
And he's been secretly married
to Linda Keene for some time.

361
00:38:18,162 --> 00:38:21,325
They're a lovely-looking couple,
don't you think?

362
00:38:29,507 --> 00:38:32,237
My dear, l knew it.

363
00:38:36,781 --> 00:38:38,976
-How do you do?
-Good evening.

364
00:38:41,819 --> 00:38:45,277
That's what l like about boats,
everyone's so friendly.

365
00:38:47,058 --> 00:38:48,286
A toast.

366
00:39:07,078 --> 00:39:09,308
Wake up, Petrov.

367
00:39:09,380 --> 00:39:11,348
We're going to have a baby?

368
00:39:11,415 --> 00:39:14,043
-What?
-Why did you keep this a secret from me?

369
00:39:14,118 --> 00:39:17,246
-What are you talking about?
-lt's all here in the ship's bulletin.

370
00:39:17,321 --> 00:39:19,721
lt says you've been married for years
to Linda Keene.

371
00:39:19,790 --> 00:39:21,087
And the editor announces:

372
00:39:21,158 --> 00:39:24,491
''lt is rumored that a blessed event
is imminent.''

373
00:39:25,629 --> 00:39:28,063
Why did this have to happen to me?

374
00:39:28,532 --> 00:39:31,160
To you? lt hasn't even happened to me.

375
00:39:32,336 --> 00:39:33,928
Lady Tarrington.

376
00:39:36,440 --> 00:39:39,102
Do you realize
that you're the father of my child?

377
00:39:39,176 --> 00:39:41,940
Of course, that's ridiculous,
that's impossible.

378
00:39:42,012 --> 00:39:44,207
lt's very simple.
You told Denise l was married...

379
00:39:44,281 --> 00:39:47,876
somebody selected a wife,
and now l'm going to be a father.

380
00:39:47,952 --> 00:39:50,887
-lsn't that cute?
-Cute? lt's a miracle.

381
00:39:50,955 --> 00:39:54,413
l warned you association with that
Keene woman would get you into trouble.

382
00:39:54,492 --> 00:39:56,983
l warned you l was gonna fall in love
with her. l have.

383
00:39:57,061 --> 00:40:00,519
-lt's your fault, go and explain it to her.
-l'll do nothing of the kind.

384
00:40:00,598 --> 00:40:02,691
lf you want me to dance
at the Metropolitan...

385
00:40:02,767 --> 00:40:04,496
you go to Linda and clear this thing up.

386
00:40:04,568 --> 00:40:06,968
ln that case perhaps l had better.

387
00:40:07,071 --> 00:40:08,971
l'll take care of this.

388
00:40:12,376 --> 00:40:15,903
Operator, get me Mr. Petrov.

389
00:40:16,614 --> 00:40:19,208
What? Don't you dare congratulate me.

390
00:40:23,220 --> 00:40:24,448
Come in.

391
00:40:28,492 --> 00:40:32,428
l've come to tell you, Miss Keene,
that we will not tolerate your insinuations.

392
00:40:32,496 --> 00:40:34,293
Stay where you are...

393
00:40:34,665 --> 00:40:36,724
while l compose myself.

394
00:40:38,569 --> 00:40:42,903
l suppose you and that toe dancer think
this whole thing's a good joke.

395
00:40:43,040 --> 00:40:46,567
lt was not altogether the toe dancer,
Mr. Petrov's fault.

396
00:40:46,644 --> 00:40:47,736
lt wasn't?

397
00:40:47,812 --> 00:40:50,940
A man in Petrov's position is besieged
by women.

398
00:40:51,015 --> 00:40:52,346
Naturally.

399
00:40:52,883 --> 00:40:55,647
And there was one
persistent wretch who....

400
00:40:55,719 --> 00:40:58,984
Well, to get rid of her,
he said he was married to you.

401
00:40:59,056 --> 00:41:00,580
-To get rid of her?
-Exactly.

402
00:41:00,658 --> 00:41:05,186
He had to choose somebody, and he felt
that a person like you wouldn't mind.

403
00:41:05,262 --> 00:41:08,663
-So he used me to....
-Exactly.

404
00:41:08,933 --> 00:41:11,527
You see, it wasn't altogether a joke.

405
00:41:14,071 --> 00:41:16,198
Good morning, little mother.

406
00:41:32,523 --> 00:41:33,990
Good morning.

407
00:41:34,391 --> 00:41:36,757
l want to book passage on that mail plane.

408
00:41:36,827 --> 00:41:39,853
l'm sorry, but that's against
government regulations.

409
00:41:39,930 --> 00:41:43,832
But l must leave the ship.
lt's absolutely urgent that l leave.

410
00:41:44,768 --> 00:41:48,135
Well, l understand,
but it's just a little irregular.

411
00:41:48,272 --> 00:41:51,207
l'm quite sure the government
would understand.

412
00:41:51,275 --> 00:41:55,075
Well, perhaps under the existing
circumstances, madam--

413
00:41:55,212 --> 00:41:56,804
Not madam, miss!

414
00:42:13,898 --> 00:42:15,365
Where's Linda?

415
00:42:16,166 --> 00:42:17,497
Pardon me.

416
00:42:18,302 --> 00:42:19,929
Take a good look.

417
00:42:34,585 --> 00:42:36,610
Gosh, and l could have
explained everything.

418
00:42:36,687 --> 00:42:39,588
You couldn't have explained her
embarrassment and humiliation.

419
00:42:39,657 --> 00:42:40,749
Thanks.

420
00:42:40,824 --> 00:42:42,519
Now she's going to get married.

421
00:42:42,593 --> 00:42:44,083
-Married?
-Yes.

422
00:42:45,262 --> 00:42:46,923
Married to a Park Avenue cluck...

423
00:42:46,997 --> 00:42:49,966
with the longest yacht
and the shortest chin ever christened.

424
00:42:50,034 --> 00:42:53,265
-You've driven her to that.
-Me? l didn't do anything.

425
00:42:53,337 --> 00:42:55,271
Only told somebody
you were married to her...

426
00:42:55,339 --> 00:42:58,672
just to get rid of another dame,
only used her, that's all.

427
00:42:58,742 --> 00:43:01,677
-Who said l did?
-Your impresario, Mr. Baird.

428
00:43:02,346 --> 00:43:03,540
Oh, he did?

429
00:43:08,185 --> 00:43:09,209
Excuse me, gentlemen...

430
00:43:09,286 --> 00:43:12,915
in a few moments the fire bell will ring,
but don't pay any attention to it.

431
00:43:12,990 --> 00:43:15,322
-A fire drill for the ship's crew.
-Right.

432
00:43:15,392 --> 00:43:17,257
He's probably in here.

433
00:43:18,495 --> 00:43:21,328
Did you tell Miss Keene that l used her
to get rid of a woman?

434
00:43:21,398 --> 00:43:22,456
My very words, dear boy.

435
00:43:22,533 --> 00:43:24,626
One of these days
you'll thank me for doing it.

436
00:43:24,702 --> 00:43:27,000
Thank you?
lf l didn't need you to explain to her--

437
00:43:27,071 --> 00:43:28,163
What is the matter with you?

438
00:43:28,238 --> 00:43:31,435
Haven't you any feeling of responsibility
for your art, your company?

439
00:43:31,508 --> 00:43:33,135
Do you realize because of your lies...

440
00:43:33,210 --> 00:43:35,678
the best musical comedy star
is quitting show business?

441
00:43:35,746 --> 00:43:36,838
ls that so? That's no loss.

442
00:43:36,914 --> 00:43:39,644
lt'd be if Petrov were mixed up
with that cheap vaudeville.

443
00:43:39,717 --> 00:43:42,117
However, l've scotched all that,
and l'm proud of it.

444
00:43:42,186 --> 00:43:44,211
You scotched it all right.

445
00:43:46,457 --> 00:43:48,823
This boat is getting terrible.
What is that noise?

446
00:43:48,892 --> 00:43:51,656
-lt's a fire, the boat's on fire.
-ls it?

447
00:43:52,596 --> 00:43:53,927
This boat?

448
00:43:54,965 --> 00:43:57,695
Of course, yes! What are we going to do?

449
00:43:57,901 --> 00:43:59,027
-Nothing.
-Nothing?

450
00:43:59,103 --> 00:44:00,866
-Stay where you are.
-Stay where you are.

451
00:44:00,938 --> 00:44:03,099
-Don't move.
-Don't move, but hurry. My word, yes!

452
00:44:04,174 --> 00:44:06,870
-You'd better get into this.
-l'm going to sue the company.

453
00:44:06,944 --> 00:44:08,844
-lf we get out alive.
-l'll sue them anyway.

454
00:44:08,912 --> 00:44:11,176
Take the Thermos,
you may get stranded on an island.

455
00:44:11,248 --> 00:44:12,579
We'll need this for cold nights.

456
00:44:12,650 --> 00:44:14,618
l feel the flames, they're getting nearer.

457
00:44:14,685 --> 00:44:17,586
Now let's keep our heads.
What else do we need?

458
00:44:17,655 --> 00:44:18,815
-Hats.
-Of course, hats.

459
00:44:18,889 --> 00:44:20,857
-We don't want head colds.
-No.

460
00:44:20,924 --> 00:44:23,654
Gentlemen always dress,
even on a tropical island.

461
00:44:23,727 --> 00:44:25,661
-And this basket of fruit to eat.
-Of course.

462
00:44:25,729 --> 00:44:28,220
l'll pick up a few blankets. No, wait.

463
00:44:28,298 --> 00:44:30,357
The clock, so l'll know when it's bedtime.

464
00:44:30,434 --> 00:44:32,163
Petrov, l know they've lowered our boat.

465
00:44:32,236 --> 00:44:35,933
Take this. We may be stranded for a while.
Time will hang heavy on our hands.

466
00:44:36,006 --> 00:44:38,566
-We will vary it with a little golf.
-A little golf, yes.

467
00:44:38,642 --> 00:44:41,543
-Go ahead, Boat Station 4.
-Station 4. We got everything?

468
00:44:41,612 --> 00:44:44,137
-Everything.
-Come on, don't forget the blanket.

469
00:44:44,214 --> 00:44:47,183
-l'll get the blankets.
-And don't get excited, just follow me.

470
00:44:47,251 --> 00:44:48,980
Come on, follow me.

471
00:44:53,757 --> 00:44:55,554
Come on, Petrov, hurry up.

472
00:44:55,659 --> 00:44:58,423
l'm all right. Don't get excited, anybody.

473
00:44:58,495 --> 00:45:01,623
Everybody keep calm.
My boat's Number 4.

474
00:45:01,699 --> 00:45:04,634
My boat's Number 4, where? Four?

475
00:45:04,702 --> 00:45:08,160
All right, l'm here. Let it down.

476
00:45:08,605 --> 00:45:10,596
What are you waiting for?

477
00:45:58,889 --> 00:46:02,290
Miss Keene? She's back already?

478
00:46:02,359 --> 00:46:06,090
Goody. Miss Keene's back.
Give me her key, will you, please?

479
00:46:07,097 --> 00:46:08,894
Thank you, very much.

480
00:46:13,804 --> 00:46:16,739
-Welcome home, l'm so happy to see you.
-Thank you, Cecil.

481
00:46:16,807 --> 00:46:21,244
You're in sooner than we expected.
Are you alone?

482
00:46:22,079 --> 00:46:25,173
Certainly, and who else
would be with me?

483
00:46:26,049 --> 00:46:29,314
You are the one, miss,
keeping it a secret so long.

484
00:46:29,620 --> 00:46:31,986
-There is no secret.
-No, not now but--

485
00:46:32,055 --> 00:46:33,317
There never was.

486
00:46:33,390 --> 00:46:36,553
Very well, miss.
l know professional people.

487
00:46:36,627 --> 00:46:39,528
You'll find me the very soul of discretion.

488
00:46:40,063 --> 00:46:41,860
Yes, indeed.

489
00:46:47,437 --> 00:46:50,804
Just one moment, please.
l've got a surprise for you.

490
00:46:54,378 --> 00:46:55,538
<i>Voila!</i>

491
00:47:49,833 --> 00:47:53,564
-Jim, l'm so glad to see you.
-l received your cable, Linda.

492
00:47:53,871 --> 00:47:56,669
You're looking very well, considering.

493
00:47:56,907 --> 00:48:00,365
-You look grand, too, Jim.
-Thanks, l'm lucky that way.

494
00:48:01,078 --> 00:48:03,069
Nothing shows in my face.

495
00:48:03,947 --> 00:48:05,812
But why didn't you tell me, Linda?

496
00:48:05,883 --> 00:48:08,579
Tell you? There's nothing to tell.

497
00:48:09,186 --> 00:48:12,246
-Then somebody's wrong.
-Oh, that.

498
00:48:13,423 --> 00:48:15,357
Lot of false malicious gossip.

499
00:48:20,130 --> 00:48:23,293
Petrov? On his way up? Splendid.

500
00:48:30,841 --> 00:48:34,004
-Cecil Flintridge.
-No, Jeffrey Baird.

501
00:48:34,378 --> 00:48:37,176
l beg your pardon, Cecil Flintridge.

502
00:48:38,348 --> 00:48:40,748
l beg your pardon, Jeffrey Baird.

503
00:48:41,685 --> 00:48:43,676
No, Cecil Flintridge.

504
00:48:44,588 --> 00:48:48,524
l don't like to disillusion you, old man,
but l am Jeffrey Baird, Petrov's manager.

505
00:48:48,592 --> 00:48:50,617
And l am Cecil Flintridge.

506
00:48:51,695 --> 00:48:53,162
You mean you are Cecil Flintridge?

507
00:48:53,230 --> 00:48:55,630
-Yes, that's what l mean.
-Well, what of it?

508
00:48:55,699 --> 00:48:56,757
What?

509
00:48:56,833 --> 00:48:59,165
-Cecil of the hotel?
-Yes, of the hotel.

510
00:48:59,236 --> 00:49:00,726
Of course. Well, how are you?

511
00:49:00,804 --> 00:49:03,238
How are you? How do you do, indeed?

512
00:49:04,174 --> 00:49:07,166
l've been at great pains
to make you and Mr. Petrov comfortable.

513
00:49:07,244 --> 00:49:10,270
-Have you really? That's very kind.
-l thought it was kind of me.

514
00:49:10,347 --> 00:49:13,475
Your suite is right next to
Mrs., or shall l say, Miss Keene?

515
00:49:13,550 --> 00:49:15,108
Miss Keene? What!

516
00:49:15,185 --> 00:49:18,484
You blundering blunderer!

517
00:49:20,891 --> 00:49:22,085
Petrov.

518
00:49:26,296 --> 00:49:29,857
-Do you know where we are?
-Wait a minute, don't tell me.

519
00:49:30,233 --> 00:49:31,427
New York.

520
00:49:31,501 --> 00:49:34,299
Yes. No, we're right next to Linda Keene.

521
00:49:34,671 --> 00:49:36,639
-Good.
-That's what l thought.

522
00:49:36,707 --> 00:49:39,642
Nobody's interested in what you think,
if you do.

523
00:49:39,710 --> 00:49:42,178
l'm only trying to do my best, sir.

524
00:49:42,245 --> 00:49:45,009
Do your next best and move us
to another part of this hotel.

525
00:49:45,082 --> 00:49:47,346
Why shouldn't married people
have adjoining suites?

526
00:49:47,417 --> 00:49:50,250
-Because they're not married.
-Not married?

527
00:50:08,071 --> 00:50:09,265
Arthur.

528
00:50:11,241 --> 00:50:14,472
Linda, l've only kept the roof open
in the hope you'd come back.

529
00:50:14,544 --> 00:50:17,536
Since you left,
l haven't had one revue there.

530
00:50:17,814 --> 00:50:19,941
l couldn't find a big enough name.

531
00:50:20,050 --> 00:50:22,075
Arthur, l'm not that good.

532
00:50:22,486 --> 00:50:24,818
You're right, Linda, you're not.

533
00:50:25,889 --> 00:50:30,724
Seriously, the crowds who haven't been
on the roof since you left think you are.

534
00:50:30,994 --> 00:50:33,519
-Arthur, l forgot to tell you something.
-What, Lynn?

535
00:50:33,597 --> 00:50:36,395
l'm going to be married
to Jim Montgomery.

536
00:50:38,468 --> 00:50:40,459
Well, l guess l'm licked.

537
00:50:40,904 --> 00:50:42,963
lf you have your mind made up
that definitely...

538
00:50:43,040 --> 00:50:45,907
there's nothing more l can say
to influence you.

539
00:50:45,976 --> 00:50:48,069
No, l'm afraid there's not.

540
00:50:51,114 --> 00:50:53,014
Except to wish me luck.

541
00:50:53,250 --> 00:50:56,481
Well, you know l do, Lynn.
All the best, the very best.

542
00:50:56,553 --> 00:50:57,815
Thank you, Arthur.

543
00:50:57,888 --> 00:51:00,584
There's just one thing l insist
on doing for you.

544
00:51:00,657 --> 00:51:01,715
What's that?

545
00:51:01,792 --> 00:51:05,922
Give you and Jim a farewell dinner,
tonight, on the roof.

546
00:51:06,329 --> 00:51:07,796
We'd love it.

547
00:51:08,265 --> 00:51:10,563
So nice of you to think of Jim.

548
00:51:10,834 --> 00:51:12,859
l think of him constantly.

549
00:51:34,658 --> 00:51:36,785
We've had our dinner.
What are we doing up here?

550
00:51:36,860 --> 00:51:38,885
You'll find out when l do.

551
00:51:40,030 --> 00:51:42,294
Yes, Mr. Petrov,
Mr. Miller's expecting you.

552
00:51:42,365 --> 00:51:43,957
This way, please.

553
00:52:21,571 --> 00:52:23,801
-Take this to Evans.
-Yes, sir.

554
00:52:46,530 --> 00:52:48,157
Thank you, Arthur.
