1
00:02:31,951 --> 00:02:33,384
Thanks, Mac.

2
00:03:26,739 --> 00:03:28,400
Okay, now try it.

3
00:03:32,178 --> 00:03:33,509
What did you do?

4
00:03:33,580 --> 00:03:36,743
The high-tension lead from the coil
had jumped off the distributor, that's all.

5
00:03:36,849 --> 00:03:39,147
You think they might be able to use
a mechanic around here?

6
00:03:39,219 --> 00:03:40,777
I just park the truck here, Mac.

7
00:03:40,987 --> 00:03:43,683
You have to talk to Prohosko.
He don't open until 8:00.

8
00:04:21,027 --> 00:04:22,392
What's the matter with you?

9
00:04:22,462 --> 00:04:24,692
There ain't nothing the matter with me.
Look. See?

10
00:04:24,764 --> 00:04:26,823
Bag of sunbeams every morning.

11
00:04:26,899 --> 00:04:30,357
- Where's Willy?
- He went shopping in the village.

12
00:04:31,137 --> 00:04:33,298
At 7:30 in the morning, he goes shopping?

13
00:04:33,373 --> 00:04:37,104
Well, he says it improves his credit
at Sperling's market.

14
00:04:37,810 --> 00:04:41,610
You see, later in the day
the old man gets tired, and he can be tough.

15
00:04:42,081 --> 00:04:44,914
- Lew, I asked you what's wrong.
- Please, Dolly...

16
00:04:44,984 --> 00:04:47,544
I got 10 human tigers out there
waiting for my fatherly advice.

17
00:04:47,620 --> 00:04:51,522
You know, there ain't nothing worse than a
suspicious dame first thing in the morning.

18
00:04:58,097 --> 00:05:01,225
I'm sorry to barge in like this, ma'am,
but I couldn't get the bell to work.

19
00:05:01,301 --> 00:05:02,928
That's the way it's supposed to be, soldier.

20
00:05:03,002 --> 00:05:05,300
It keeps the guests from throwing punches
at the wrong time.

21
00:05:06,406 --> 00:05:09,102
It's a nice place, you know. Real nice.

22
00:05:09,776 --> 00:05:11,368
- Where?
- Here.

23
00:05:12,979 --> 00:05:15,311
That's what I thought you said.

24
00:05:15,982 --> 00:05:18,382
I was wondering if I could see Mr. Grogan.

25
00:05:21,254 --> 00:05:23,222
He isn't here right now.

26
00:05:24,524 --> 00:05:26,492
Are you a fighter?

27
00:05:27,627 --> 00:05:30,790
No, ma'am. I just got out of the army,
and just happened to drop by.

28
00:05:31,531 --> 00:05:32,725
I see.

29
00:05:32,799 --> 00:05:35,666
Well, he should be back pretty soon.
You want a cup of coffee?

30
00:05:35,735 --> 00:05:38,727
If it wouldn't be too much trouble,
yes, ma'am.

31
00:05:41,474 --> 00:05:44,068
- Sugar?
- Thank you.

32
00:05:50,350 --> 00:05:52,443
I guess I did gulp it down in a hurry,
didn't I?

33
00:05:53,152 --> 00:05:55,245
Either you gulped it down in quite a hurry...

34
00:05:55,321 --> 00:05:58,381
or you're the first two-legged horse
I've seen this year.

35
00:05:58,458 --> 00:06:00,119
How long has it been
since you've had a meal?

36
00:06:00,360 --> 00:06:01,884
It's not like that, ma'am. Honest. I just...

37
00:06:01,961 --> 00:06:04,657
I got in town kind of early this morning.
There was nothing open.

38
00:06:05,131 --> 00:06:06,723
Don't apologize.

39
00:06:07,433 --> 00:06:09,060
Okay, soldier, come on.

40
00:06:09,135 --> 00:06:12,662
The one thing about keeping chickens,
you never run out of breakfast.

41
00:06:14,474 --> 00:06:16,408
You got some food for the army, Maynard?

42
00:06:16,476 --> 00:06:18,967
Why?
Are things that tough at the Pentagon?

43
00:06:19,045 --> 00:06:20,342
- Sit down.
- Thank you.

44
00:06:22,548 --> 00:06:23,776
Thank you.

45
00:06:23,850 --> 00:06:26,978
I'd hate to tell you how long it's been
since anybody did that for me.

46
00:06:27,053 --> 00:06:30,386
There was a captain I knew in the army
used to do it for his wife all the time.

47
00:06:30,456 --> 00:06:31,855
How about some eggs?

48
00:06:31,924 --> 00:06:34,586
Yes, ma'am. Just any style at all. Thank you.

49
00:06:35,428 --> 00:06:37,919
- What's your name, soldier?
- Walter Gulick.

50
00:06:38,664 --> 00:06:40,894
You know, as nice and homey
as this place is...

51
00:06:40,967 --> 00:06:43,128
I thought maybe you were a...

52
00:06:44,504 --> 00:06:46,995
- Mrs. Grogan?
- That's what I was getting at.

53
00:06:47,206 --> 00:06:48,434
Well, not yet, Walter.

54
00:06:48,508 --> 00:06:52,444
You see, actually, I'm Mr. Grogan's fiancée.

55
00:07:00,153 --> 00:07:03,714
You haven't told me
why you wanted to see Mr. Grogan.

56
00:07:04,090 --> 00:07:07,150
Well, for one reason,
I could use a job for a few days.

57
00:07:07,627 --> 00:07:09,822
Fresh out of the army and dead broke?

58
00:07:09,896 --> 00:07:11,727
I'm afraid that's about the size of it.

59
00:07:11,798 --> 00:07:13,891
You see, I got in a crap game
with my separation pay...

60
00:07:13,966 --> 00:07:15,934
and it got separated from me, you know.

61
00:07:16,469 --> 00:07:19,597
- How do you happen to know Mr. Grogan?
- Well, I don't really.

62
00:07:19,672 --> 00:07:23,438
It's a funny thing, though,
all my life I've always wanted to come here.

63
00:07:23,509 --> 00:07:24,635
Here?

64
00:07:25,578 --> 00:07:27,569
- To Cream Valley?
- Oh, yes.

65
00:07:27,647 --> 00:07:30,377
- I've thought about it quite a lot.
- I see.

66
00:07:31,317 --> 00:07:35,583
Well, I don't want to sound cynical
or anything, Walter, but why?

67
00:07:35,788 --> 00:07:38,951
- Well, I was born here in Cream Valley.
- You're kidding.

68
00:07:39,525 --> 00:07:43,325
Nobody was born in Cream Valley,
except Rip Van Winkle.

69
00:07:43,663 --> 00:07:46,029
And occasionally you see a robin's egg.

70
00:07:46,699 --> 00:07:48,963
My mother and father are buried here.

71
00:07:50,236 --> 00:07:53,205
- I'm sorry.
- That's me and my folks there.

72
00:07:54,006 --> 00:07:56,531
I was only 14 months old
when they passed away.

73
00:07:56,642 --> 00:07:58,974
I was raised in Lowbridge, Kentucky,
with an aunt.

74
00:07:59,045 --> 00:08:00,740
Oh, Kentucky, well.

75
00:08:01,414 --> 00:08:03,143
Of course, my stopping off here
doesn't mean...

76
00:08:03,216 --> 00:08:04,774
that I don't have plans for what I want to do.

77
00:08:04,851 --> 00:08:07,046
All the time I was working in that motor pool
in Okinawa...

78
00:08:07,119 --> 00:08:09,087
I was just looking forward
to the time when I could...

79
00:08:09,155 --> 00:08:11,646
own my own garage in someplace
where I really belonged, you know?

80
00:08:12,024 --> 00:08:15,357
I was just thinking, if Mr. Grogan
could use a mechanic around here...

81
00:08:15,428 --> 00:08:17,726
it would be like coming home.

82
00:08:17,797 --> 00:08:20,561
- You think there's a chance that...
- I wouldn't count on it, Walter.

83
00:08:20,633 --> 00:08:24,194
You see, the way things have been
for Mr. Grogan...

84
00:08:27,306 --> 00:08:28,705
Right now...

85
00:08:29,742 --> 00:08:31,733
Actually, Harry,
things never looked better at the camp.

86
00:08:31,811 --> 00:08:33,779
Just a matter of waiting for the money
to come in.

87
00:08:33,846 --> 00:08:36,314
- $376.
- Should start rolling in any minute now.

88
00:08:36,382 --> 00:08:38,543
Willy, please. Don't bother.

89
00:08:39,719 --> 00:08:43,951
Since before you was born,
when your father started the camp there...

90
00:08:44,023 --> 00:08:45,854
did I ever say no to a Grogan?

91
00:08:46,292 --> 00:08:47,316
No.

92
00:08:47,760 --> 00:08:49,523
Old friends are the best friends, Harry.

93
00:08:49,595 --> 00:08:51,995
Not that you ain't just as much a bum
in your own right...

94
00:08:52,064 --> 00:08:53,326
as your father was a gentleman.

95
00:08:54,600 --> 00:08:56,124
Harry, listen.

96
00:08:58,371 --> 00:09:00,202
Harry, let's understand one thing...

97
00:09:00,273 --> 00:09:02,707
You'll never solve your problems
betting the horses, Willy.

98
00:09:03,175 --> 00:09:05,075
And I can tell you right now...

99
00:09:05,144 --> 00:09:07,635
I don't like what's going on
in the fight game these days.

100
00:09:08,114 --> 00:09:09,672
I don't like what I read in the papers.

101
00:09:09,749 --> 00:09:11,478
Don't you worry about what you read
in the papers.

102
00:09:11,551 --> 00:09:13,815
I'll lay you 3-to-1 right now
when you understand the facts.

103
00:09:13,886 --> 00:09:16,184
- Mr. Grogan, it's all in the car.
- Thanks, George.

104
00:09:16,255 --> 00:09:17,313
Yes?

105
00:09:18,124 --> 00:09:21,491
Yes, Mrs. Clotman,
I'll be happy to take your order.

106
00:09:23,195 --> 00:09:25,561
Just got a fresh shipment in yesterday.

107
00:09:41,047 --> 00:09:44,073
- Your name is Grogan?
- That's just possible.

108
00:09:44,650 --> 00:09:48,450
- Who are you?
- O'Grady, Self Reliant Finance Company.

109
00:09:49,188 --> 00:09:51,679
- Home office.
- Home office.

110
00:09:52,592 --> 00:09:56,255
Do I have to have you fellows climbing
my back every day for a lousy $150?

111
00:09:56,329 --> 00:09:59,696
I'm giving you the message, Mr. Grogan,
direct from the district manager.

112
00:09:59,765 --> 00:10:03,667
Now, just a minute.
You're a big man, O'Grady. I'll tell you what.

113
00:10:03,736 --> 00:10:06,261
I'll flip you, double or nothing.

114
00:10:06,906 --> 00:10:09,101
We don't do it that way, Mr. Grogan.

115
00:10:09,175 --> 00:10:12,941
Either you get up the dough,
or it's strictly heel and toe.

116
00:10:14,714 --> 00:10:16,113
A poet, yet.

117
00:10:26,726 --> 00:10:30,355
Look, George,
you couldn't have driven around in back?

118
00:10:30,429 --> 00:10:33,091
This is where I always stop
when I make a delivery, Mr. Grogan.

119
00:10:33,165 --> 00:10:34,462
You never complained before.

120
00:10:34,533 --> 00:10:38,128
I never came back from the village
like a sack of potatoes before.

121
00:10:40,139 --> 00:10:41,606
What happened to the convertible?

122
00:10:44,944 --> 00:10:46,172
I loaned it to an Arab.

123
00:10:46,946 --> 00:10:49,972
He was on his way to a picnic,
and his camel had trouble with its valves.

124
00:10:50,049 --> 00:10:53,849
When I ask a simple question, I don't expect
I should have to listen to your lousy jokes.

125
00:10:53,919 --> 00:10:55,113
What's the matter with you?

126
00:10:55,187 --> 00:10:58,520
I got nobody to work out with my boy
this afternoon. That's one thing the matter...

127
00:10:58,591 --> 00:11:01,389
That's because you're too cheap
to pay more than $5 a round.

128
00:11:01,494 --> 00:11:04,327
And your boy thinks every workout is a war.

129
00:11:07,667 --> 00:11:10,966
Here he is. You wait here.
Let me speak to him first.

130
00:11:11,037 --> 00:11:12,197
Thank you.

131
00:11:12,271 --> 00:11:14,466
What's with the soldier?
Who asked for a parade?

132
00:11:14,540 --> 00:11:17,873
Not so loud, honey, please.
He just stopped by to see you.

133
00:11:17,943 --> 00:11:20,741
- Yeah? And what's his angle?
- It isn't like that.

134
00:11:21,480 --> 00:11:23,471
He's just looking for a job, that's all.

135
00:11:23,549 --> 00:11:27,110
I gathered from what he told me,
he's some kind of an automobile specialist.

136
00:11:27,186 --> 00:11:28,949
- A mechanic.
- A what?

137
00:11:29,288 --> 00:11:31,279
You heard me, a mechanic.

138
00:11:31,490 --> 00:11:34,687
Now, all I want you to do
is brush him off lightly.

139
00:11:35,761 --> 00:11:36,853
Okay.

140
00:11:38,764 --> 00:11:39,958
Walter.

141
00:11:41,967 --> 00:11:43,559
Willy, this is Walter Gulick.

142
00:11:43,636 --> 00:11:46,002
- Pleased to meet you, sir.
- I explained to Walter that...

143
00:11:46,072 --> 00:11:50,509
there mightn't be anything available
in his line, especially at this time of year.

144
00:11:50,676 --> 00:11:52,405
That's about it, soldier.

145
00:11:52,578 --> 00:11:56,912
What I mean is, well, nobody ever
called Cream Valley a little Detroit.

146
00:11:57,416 --> 00:11:59,077
I understand what you mean, sir.

147
00:11:59,151 --> 00:12:03,053
About the only job open around here
is a sparring partner for this man's tiger.

148
00:12:03,122 --> 00:12:06,091
- Well, he's the right size, ain't he?
- Oh, lay off, Howie.

149
00:12:06,158 --> 00:12:07,523
For somebody without experience...

150
00:12:07,593 --> 00:12:10,687
the kid could save himself time and trouble
by stepping in front of a train.

151
00:12:11,263 --> 00:12:14,232
I've had experience, Mr. Grogan.
I did a lot of boxing in the army.

152
00:12:14,300 --> 00:12:17,997
Now, wait a minute.
Mercy killings aren't allowed, not even here.

153
00:12:18,070 --> 00:12:20,004
Why didn't you say you wanted
to be a fighter?

154
00:12:20,072 --> 00:12:23,200
Well, it's not that I want to be a fighter,
it's just...

155
00:12:23,876 --> 00:12:26,106
I've had experience,
and I could use the money.

156
00:12:26,178 --> 00:12:28,476
I'm only in position to pay you
$5 a round, sonny.

157
00:12:28,547 --> 00:12:30,777
- I'll take it.
- That's a deal.

158
00:12:31,283 --> 00:12:35,845
- Willy, you can't let him do this.
- It's no skin off me. Talk to Zimmerman.

159
00:12:42,695 --> 00:12:44,993
Man, you have a visitor.
This time it ain't a bookmaker.

160
00:12:45,064 --> 00:12:47,225
- What kind of visitor?
- Otto Danzig.

161
00:12:49,168 --> 00:12:51,466
No, no, no. He ain't up there.
Otto's not that careless.

162
00:12:51,537 --> 00:12:54,506
He's waiting for you in that new motel
down the road.

163
00:13:09,722 --> 00:13:10,916
- Willy.
- Hello.

164
00:13:21,133 --> 00:13:24,227
- Hello, Otto.
- Hello, Willy. Sit down.

165
00:13:24,503 --> 00:13:25,492
Sit down?

166
00:13:25,871 --> 00:13:29,068
Meet some friends of mine, Willy.
Associates, let's say.

167
00:13:29,141 --> 00:13:30,870
Marvin and Ralphie.

168
00:13:31,043 --> 00:13:33,534
They're not New York boys,
so their faces won't be familiar...

169
00:13:33,612 --> 00:13:35,773
to any boxing commissioner who drops by.

170
00:13:35,848 --> 00:13:39,181
They're as legal as a nice game of checkers
in this state, Willy...

171
00:13:39,919 --> 00:13:41,944
and they'll be staying with you for a while.

172
00:13:42,021 --> 00:13:43,852
I'll take the tab for their board and room.

173
00:13:43,923 --> 00:13:47,757
Not with me you don't, Otto. I'm not running
any nursery up here for adult delinquents.

174
00:13:47,827 --> 00:13:50,921
- Sit down, Willy.
- Otto said, "Sit down."

175
00:13:52,965 --> 00:13:56,423
Now, please. We've been in the fight game
a long time together.

176
00:13:57,002 --> 00:14:00,438
You're a sociable fellow.
You like beer and conversation.

177
00:14:00,506 --> 00:14:01,666
Yeah.

178
00:14:01,740 --> 00:14:04,675
Your camp is also a nice place
for people to come calling.

179
00:14:04,743 --> 00:14:07,303
Cops, lawyers, district attorneys.

180
00:14:08,180 --> 00:14:11,013
You like to pick up a dollar,
and you like to talk.

181
00:14:11,517 --> 00:14:13,212
That's an awkward combination.

182
00:14:13,285 --> 00:14:16,254
Went all through that in Washington.
The investigation's over.

183
00:14:16,322 --> 00:14:20,622
Investigations are like the Greyhound bus.
There's always another one coming along.

184
00:14:20,793 --> 00:14:23,387
New York is next,
and that'll be the one that counts.

185
00:14:23,462 --> 00:14:24,929
Grand jury in September.

186
00:14:24,997 --> 00:14:26,328
I can't help that and I'll tell you...

187
00:14:26,398 --> 00:14:27,922
Something else you can't help, Willy:

188
00:14:28,000 --> 00:14:30,525
You're the only one who was in that
steam room with Rocky Virgil.

189
00:14:30,603 --> 00:14:32,628
That's what everybody knows
and what they won't forget.

190
00:14:32,705 --> 00:14:34,900
I don't know who came into that room
and worked over Rocky.

191
00:14:34,974 --> 00:14:36,407
The steam was as thick as split-pea soup.

192
00:14:36,475 --> 00:14:39,842
I couldn't see and I didn't hear.
The only voice I heard was Rocky's voice.

193
00:14:39,912 --> 00:14:41,243
And he was yelling like a stuck pig.

194
00:14:41,313 --> 00:14:44,578
I spelled that out for the committee,
didn't I? As plain as my own name?

195
00:14:44,650 --> 00:14:46,618
Yes, you were beautiful.

196
00:14:47,953 --> 00:14:51,286
That's why Marvin and Ralphie are going
to be with you from now until September.

197
00:14:51,357 --> 00:14:53,917
Just to make sure
you don't change your mind.

198
00:14:54,326 --> 00:14:55,793
Look, Otto...

199
00:15:05,104 --> 00:15:09,097
Otto, I don't want these torpedoes
hanging around my place.

200
00:15:09,508 --> 00:15:10,839
Do I make myself clear?

201
00:15:12,144 --> 00:15:17,104
Well, let me put it this way, Willy.
Rocky Virgil used to talk a lot like you.

202
00:15:38,404 --> 00:15:40,031
Joie, come here.

203
00:15:41,840 --> 00:15:43,501
Here, put this on.

204
00:15:44,843 --> 00:15:48,904
Now listen, Joie,
I want you to take it nice and easy in there.

205
00:15:49,214 --> 00:15:52,377
It's not like we're trying to win
the Olympics from the Russians every time.

206
00:15:52,451 --> 00:15:54,976
You make me laugh. You're always worried.
What you worried about?

207
00:15:55,054 --> 00:15:56,817
How do you want me to work him?

208
00:15:56,889 --> 00:15:59,687
Easy. Keep sticking him. Easy. That's all.

209
00:16:11,770 --> 00:16:16,434
This sort of thing a kid like you
shouldn't do, unless you've got two heads.

210
00:16:16,675 --> 00:16:18,768
Which I ain't sure you ain't got.

211
00:16:58,851 --> 00:17:02,844
Hello, peaches.
You know, you're a real lucky girl.

212
00:17:03,255 --> 00:17:07,123
You're gonna find me available
for the whole season at no extra charge.

213
00:17:16,335 --> 00:17:19,862
I wouldn't have called you at the store,
Rose, honey, unless it was an emergency.

214
00:17:19,972 --> 00:17:23,203
It's hard to talk like this
with customers waiting, Willy.

215
00:17:25,077 --> 00:17:27,204
Less than a month ago I sent you...

216
00:17:28,080 --> 00:17:29,377
What'd you say?

217
00:17:29,448 --> 00:17:32,076
I said, I like to keep a thing like this
in the family...

218
00:17:32,151 --> 00:17:34,915
because, well,
blood is thicker than chowder.

219
00:17:35,120 --> 00:17:37,111
That's what Pop used to say, remember?

220
00:17:37,189 --> 00:17:39,919
Willy, please. This is a bad time for me.

221
00:17:40,092 --> 00:17:41,821
I told you, I've got customers waiting.

222
00:17:42,127 --> 00:17:44,721
All right, then, just put it in an envelope,
but without the lecture.

223
00:17:44,797 --> 00:17:47,425
I wouldn't want to keep you
from your customers.

224
00:17:47,499 --> 00:17:48,864
Okay, thank you.

225
00:17:53,472 --> 00:17:54,598
Time.

226
00:18:08,987 --> 00:18:11,979
Joie, please, take your time in there.

227
00:18:24,937 --> 00:18:29,135
Hey, Walter, in case you want to duck
once in a while...

228
00:18:29,308 --> 00:18:30,900
it ain't against the rules.

229
00:18:48,594 --> 00:18:52,360
- This sort of thing is legal?
- You don't need a license to be stupid.

230
00:18:52,764 --> 00:18:55,824
I'll lay you 3-to-1,
the kid don't last the round.

231
00:19:22,494 --> 00:19:24,257
What happened? Did Joie trip?

232
00:19:24,329 --> 00:19:25,956
Joie, please.

233
00:19:27,566 --> 00:19:30,034
We can't afford to get knocked
out by this zombie.

234
00:19:30,102 --> 00:19:32,866
Joie! Joie, can't you hear me?

235
00:19:36,942 --> 00:19:38,807
I didn't mean to knock him out.

236
00:19:38,877 --> 00:19:41,505
Getting a little uncomfortable in here,
you know.

237
00:19:42,347 --> 00:19:43,939
Do I still get my $5?

238
00:19:50,122 --> 00:19:51,714
About the $5...

239
00:19:54,893 --> 00:19:57,157
Make sure this pigeon don't get away.

240
00:20:03,402 --> 00:20:05,302
- You guys ready to go?
- Sure.

241
00:20:10,108 --> 00:20:13,805
Hey, Joie. Come on.
How are we supposed to sing without you?

242
00:20:30,195 --> 00:20:32,163
What did you hit me with? A bomb?

243
00:20:33,599 --> 00:20:37,035
- Just one of those things.
- Come on, Joie. Let's go.

244
00:20:37,102 --> 00:20:38,399
I think they want you over there.

245
00:20:38,470 --> 00:20:41,496
Come on, why don't you come
and sing with us? Come on.

246
00:21:50,108 --> 00:21:52,008
And you can sing, too?

247
00:21:52,077 --> 00:21:53,442
Come on, let's get a cup of coffee.

248
00:22:01,386 --> 00:22:03,320
These guys are going steady now.

249
00:22:03,522 --> 00:22:05,217
You know, that Walter's a very nice kid.

250
00:22:05,290 --> 00:22:07,520
Never mind how nice he is.
I hear enough of that from Dolly.

251
00:22:07,759 --> 00:22:10,091
I told her the only important thing
about him is...

252
00:22:10,162 --> 00:22:13,529
he's got an ax in his right hand,
and a bowling ball for a head.

253
00:22:13,598 --> 00:22:15,828
How come the punches don't bother him?

254
00:22:15,901 --> 00:22:17,801
Just one of those things, Willy.

255
00:22:17,869 --> 00:22:20,463
He's the kind of guy you hit on the chin
and nothing disconnects.

256
00:22:20,539 --> 00:22:22,598
- Marciano had it, remember?
- Yeah.

257
00:22:22,674 --> 00:22:24,437
You know, he don't even blink
when he's belted.

258
00:22:24,509 --> 00:22:27,239
- Like there was no fuse up there to blow.
- That's what I was thinking.

259
00:22:27,312 --> 00:22:30,281
There ought to be a dollar to be made
with that kind of a knot head.

260
00:22:30,349 --> 00:22:31,782
I'm keeping him around.

261
00:22:31,850 --> 00:22:34,910
I've learned enough about human nature
to know the world's full of jerks...

262
00:22:34,986 --> 00:22:36,010
and they'll love this guy on TV.

263
00:22:36,088 --> 00:22:38,579
Come on, Willy, what's the matter with you?

264
00:22:38,657 --> 00:22:40,648
All he's ever had
was a few lousy fights in the army.

265
00:22:40,726 --> 00:22:42,159
He can't even hold up his hands.

266
00:22:42,227 --> 00:22:44,695
- He can learn, can't he?
- Oh, yeah, "He can learn, can't he?"

267
00:22:44,763 --> 00:22:48,028
Like a calf learns not to walk
on the tracks after it's been hit by a train.

268
00:22:48,100 --> 00:22:50,796
Let's not worry about him, huh, Lew?
Another beer?

269
00:22:51,336 --> 00:22:53,531
Dolly said she was putting a fresh pot
of coffee on.

270
00:22:53,605 --> 00:22:54,731
Okay.

271
00:22:55,874 --> 00:22:57,341
Hey, what'd Dolly say when she heard...

272
00:22:57,409 --> 00:23:00,207
the finance company put the clamp
on your convertible?

273
00:23:00,278 --> 00:23:02,041
She didn't waste much time with that.

274
00:23:02,114 --> 00:23:04,344
She was more teed-off over Otto's
bird-dogs moving in.

275
00:23:04,416 --> 00:23:07,317
- That'll be another dime, Howie, dear.
- Here you go, fatso.

276
00:23:07,386 --> 00:23:10,947
- Howie, where's your fighter?
- He went in the kitchen with Golden Boy.

277
00:23:19,798 --> 00:23:21,163
Oh, it's Ralphie.

278
00:23:21,867 --> 00:23:23,198
I'm sorry. It wouldn't have happened...

279
00:23:23,268 --> 00:23:25,099
but he don't know how to behave himself
with a lady.

280
00:23:25,170 --> 00:23:26,637
- Thanks, Galahad.
- What?

281
00:23:26,705 --> 00:23:28,798
Look. There's one thing
I want to make perfectly plain.

282
00:23:28,874 --> 00:23:31,104
- Who's Galahad?
- Shut up. Who needs him?

283
00:23:31,176 --> 00:23:33,940
You're a big girl now. And when you're
not big enough, you call on me.

284
00:23:34,012 --> 00:23:36,003
Look, you two can have a nice fight later,
all right?

285
00:23:36,081 --> 00:23:39,107
Dolly, please take Eagle Scout away
before Ralphie wakes up and kills him.

286
00:23:39,184 --> 00:23:41,812
- To where?
- Anywhere. Just get him out of here.

287
00:23:41,887 --> 00:23:42,945
Okay, come on.

288
00:23:43,021 --> 00:23:45,956
- How could the army afford to let you go?
- Now, wait a minute.

289
00:23:46,024 --> 00:23:48,049
Willy, be sensible, huh? Maynard.

290
00:23:49,060 --> 00:23:50,652
Howie, you should've seen him.

291
00:23:50,729 --> 00:23:53,391
- What a beautiful right hand...
- Forget it, Joie, go to your room...

292
00:23:53,465 --> 00:23:56,923
before the trouble starts.
Now, like I asked you, who's Galahad?

293
00:23:57,002 --> 00:23:59,766
Howie, didn't you ever go to school
or read a book?

294
00:23:59,838 --> 00:24:02,136
I'm not asking for smart answers
to a simple question.

295
00:24:02,207 --> 00:24:05,267
Besides, I'm paid up here two weeks
in advance.

296
00:24:05,610 --> 00:24:07,908
Galahad was a knight in a tin suit.
A hero with a halo.

297
00:24:07,979 --> 00:24:09,446
You understand that?

298
00:24:09,514 --> 00:24:11,880
Very courteous to broads, as I remember.

299
00:24:22,928 --> 00:24:26,329
Galahad was what they call
a Knight of the Round Table, Howie.

300
00:24:26,465 --> 00:24:28,524
He was also something of a square.

301
00:24:28,600 --> 00:24:33,594
I can't state this as a positive fact,
but he probably died very young.

302
00:24:44,216 --> 00:24:46,150
- It's a real nice place.
- It's nice enough.

303
00:24:47,319 --> 00:24:48,718
I used to work here, singing.

304
00:24:49,788 --> 00:24:52,416
- You did?
- We won't go into that.

305
00:24:53,124 --> 00:24:55,490
Hey, you got a dime?

306
00:24:57,128 --> 00:25:00,620
Look. Go inside Lieberman's here,
there's a phone booth on the right.

307
00:25:00,699 --> 00:25:03,259
The number is Cream Valley 1732.

308
00:25:03,335 --> 00:25:07,396
You get Lew on the phone and
ask him if it's all right if we come back now.

309
00:25:14,412 --> 00:25:16,141
Is that you, Dolly?

310
00:25:16,648 --> 00:25:19,549
- Did you have to sneak up on me?
- You know me, Dolly...

311
00:25:19,618 --> 00:25:22,086
- always minding the store.
- Yeah.

312
00:25:22,521 --> 00:25:25,957
- We missed you, Dolly.
- Thank you, Max.

313
00:25:26,024 --> 00:25:29,152
The same nice families
keep coming up and they all ask:

314
00:25:29,227 --> 00:25:32,219
- "How's Dolly?"
- That's very nice.

315
00:25:32,297 --> 00:25:34,765
Anytime you want to leave
that hooligan down the road...

316
00:25:34,833 --> 00:25:37,324
your old job's waiting for you right here.

317
00:25:37,669 --> 00:25:40,035
I think you know better than that, Max.

318
00:25:40,105 --> 00:25:41,629
It's love, huh?

319
00:25:42,607 --> 00:25:45,974
Well, if that's the right word for it, yes.

320
00:25:46,478 --> 00:25:50,938
I met him right here.
Right here, three summers ago.

321
00:25:51,550 --> 00:25:53,450
It's no different now?

322
00:25:54,553 --> 00:25:56,077
Why kid myself?

323
00:25:56,221 --> 00:25:59,816
It's still just like a ride on a rocket,
whenever he's nice to me.

324
00:26:02,294 --> 00:26:06,025
That young soldier,
they expect to make a fighter out of him?

325
00:26:06,097 --> 00:26:09,066
I imagine they will.
Over somebody's dead body.

326
00:26:09,134 --> 00:26:10,624
Very likely his own.

327
00:26:13,805 --> 00:26:17,468
What's he expect to find in there?
John L. Sullivan?

328
00:26:17,542 --> 00:26:20,340
It's kind of a surprise.
Something I saw earlier.

329
00:26:21,279 --> 00:26:23,611
- Saw what?
- You'll see.

330
00:26:25,750 --> 00:26:27,718
Oh, you mean that thing?

331
00:26:32,924 --> 00:26:34,858
I'll show you. Come on.

332
00:26:36,461 --> 00:26:37,689
Grab a hold of the other one.

333
00:26:37,762 --> 00:26:39,457
- Get out of here.
- Why not?

334
00:26:39,531 --> 00:26:40,793
For two bucks, right down the road...

335
00:26:40,865 --> 00:26:42,230
you can hire a horse, that's why not.

336
00:26:42,300 --> 00:26:43,358
We don't need no horse, Lew.

337
00:26:43,435 --> 00:26:45,630
Come on, let's pull it down.
I want to show you something.

338
00:26:45,704 --> 00:26:48,969
All right, Galahad. Boy, I'm telling you...

339
00:26:50,542 --> 00:26:51,440
Wait a minute.

340
00:26:51,509 --> 00:26:53,875
I'm telling you,
you're not gonna get that thing out of there.

341
00:26:53,945 --> 00:26:55,207
Go down the road, get the horse.

342
00:26:55,280 --> 00:26:59,341
I'll tell you what: Let's try one more time.
If it don't go, we'll get the horse. Okay?

343
00:26:59,417 --> 00:27:00,748
All right, pull.

344
00:27:05,123 --> 00:27:06,522
Horses, huh?

345
00:27:19,337 --> 00:27:22,135
- Hello, Willy.
- Rose.

346
00:27:22,941 --> 00:27:24,533
What goes on? I don't get it.

347
00:27:24,609 --> 00:27:26,941
I took an early train
and then a taxi from the station.

348
00:27:27,012 --> 00:27:29,139
But why? You know I don't want you
hanging around here.

349
00:27:29,214 --> 00:27:31,978
It's not the same as when Pop was alive.
You're not a kid anymore.

350
00:27:32,050 --> 00:27:33,347
Willy, please.

351
00:27:33,551 --> 00:27:36,714
I came up because of what you asked me
on the phone the other day.

352
00:27:36,788 --> 00:27:39,222
- The $200.
- Oh, yeah.

353
00:27:40,191 --> 00:27:43,627
I've been kind of expecting it,
but I figured maybe the mail was slow.

354
00:27:43,695 --> 00:27:45,390
I didn't mail it, Willy.

355
00:27:46,364 --> 00:27:48,457
The more I thought about it,
the more I realized...

356
00:27:48,533 --> 00:27:51,798
that it wasn't the money going down
a rathole, like the Republicans say.

357
00:27:51,870 --> 00:27:55,328
- It was the principle.
- What are you talking about?

358
00:27:55,407 --> 00:27:59,104
I had a talk with Mr. Provardis.
He's in cost accounting at the store.

359
00:27:59,177 --> 00:28:01,372
- Mr. Provardis said for what...
- Mr. Provardis said...

360
00:28:01,446 --> 00:28:04,847
Mr. Provardis said for what you're charging
up here a week, just room and board...

361
00:28:04,916 --> 00:28:07,544
- it's impossible not to make money.
- I don't care what...

362
00:28:07,619 --> 00:28:10,486
Actually, talking with Mr. Provardis,
I decided what we need up here...

363
00:28:10,555 --> 00:28:12,420
- is a complete reorganization...
- Now, wait a minute...

364
00:28:12,490 --> 00:28:16,085
- Don't shout.
- Reorganization. Rose, honey...

365
00:28:16,394 --> 00:28:19,454
Be patient. The fact is...

366
00:28:19,531 --> 00:28:23,331
you couldn't reorganize the part in your hair
unless I drew you a map.

367
00:28:23,735 --> 00:28:24,929
Now the thing for you to do...

368
00:28:25,003 --> 00:28:27,995
while I'm in a nice mood about it,
is to pick up the phone...

369
00:28:28,073 --> 00:28:31,736
and call another cab. That way you
won't miss your afternoon train back.

370
00:28:31,810 --> 00:28:33,675
I'm not going back, Willy.

371
00:28:33,745 --> 00:28:35,770
I took a leave of absence from the store.

372
00:28:35,847 --> 00:28:38,441
- But you can't stay up here.
- I'm sorry.

373
00:28:38,516 --> 00:28:41,679
- I feel I have an obligation.
- You have a what?

374
00:28:41,753 --> 00:28:45,154
Obligation. I own 50% of this place.

375
00:28:45,223 --> 00:28:49,091
- So what?
- Besides, I'm your sister.

376
00:28:49,427 --> 00:28:52,123
So it won't do any good for you
to shout at me.

377
00:28:53,965 --> 00:28:58,334
Look, Rose, baby, let me explain it to you.

378
00:29:02,107 --> 00:29:03,574
How do you like it?

379
00:29:04,075 --> 00:29:07,636
I don't know. What are you gonna do
with that, besides wear it for Halloween?

380
00:29:07,712 --> 00:29:10,442
- It could be beautiful, Lew.
- Beautiful?

381
00:29:11,349 --> 00:29:13,681
Come on, kid,
you haven't taken that many punches.

382
00:29:13,985 --> 00:29:15,612
You just don't know
character when you see it.

383
00:29:15,687 --> 00:29:18,121
This thing has got more character than
anything I've ever seen.

384
00:29:18,189 --> 00:29:20,089
Oh, now it's got character.

385
00:29:22,527 --> 00:29:26,554
I'll be doggoned, a flower vase.
Look at that, Lew.

386
00:29:27,232 --> 00:29:29,132
You think people were different
in those days, huh?

387
00:29:29,200 --> 00:29:31,100
I doubt it.

388
00:29:31,169 --> 00:29:34,195
We were the same kind of stinkers then,
just like now.

389
00:29:34,606 --> 00:29:37,734
What do you expect to come up with now,
a homemade cake?

390
00:29:40,345 --> 00:29:42,074
Don't bother taking it off.

391
00:29:42,147 --> 00:29:44,342
As I was trying to say about the $200, Willy.

392
00:29:44,415 --> 00:29:46,781
It's not as if I was trying to hold out
on my own brother.

393
00:29:46,851 --> 00:29:48,546
I told you it was an emergency, didn't I?

394
00:29:48,620 --> 00:29:50,144
Now look, this...

395
00:29:51,389 --> 00:29:54,552
Dolly, this is my kid sister, Rose.

396
00:29:57,896 --> 00:30:00,330
Rose, this is Miss...

397
00:30:05,703 --> 00:30:07,227
Miss Fletcher.

398
00:30:07,305 --> 00:30:11,401
- How do you do, Miss Fletcher?
- Hello.

399
00:30:13,745 --> 00:30:16,043
Dolly, that is, Miss Fletcher...

400
00:30:16,648 --> 00:30:21,142
sort of helps out sometimes.
She just happened to drop by this morning.

401
00:30:29,694 --> 00:30:34,028
Well, I'm very glad to have met you,
Miss Grogan.

402
00:30:34,098 --> 00:30:35,656
Very nice meeting you.

403
00:30:39,938 --> 00:30:43,465
- What's the matter?
- Nothing. It's love in bloom.

404
00:30:44,442 --> 00:30:46,740
Goodbye. I've watched it bloom before.

405
00:30:48,413 --> 00:30:52,577
Look, Dolly,
this may seem funny to you, but...

406
00:30:52,650 --> 00:30:54,811
the kid doesn't know about us.

407
00:30:55,086 --> 00:30:58,317
I gathered that much. I can even quote you.

408
00:30:59,190 --> 00:31:01,750
"Rose, this is Miss, what's her name.

409
00:31:01,826 --> 00:31:04,260
"She just happened to drop
by this morning."

410
00:31:04,329 --> 00:31:06,593
Were you so scared
you couldn't remember my name?

411
00:31:06,664 --> 00:31:09,462
- Dolly...
- What is there to know about us, anyway?

412
00:31:09,701 --> 00:31:11,601
Am I a lady barber or something?

413
00:31:11,669 --> 00:31:14,194
They've got sex in the Bronx, too,
so what's the mystery?

414
00:31:14,806 --> 00:31:19,539
I'm trying to tell you.
She's only a baby. A protected baby.

415
00:31:19,611 --> 00:31:22,671
Oh, come off it. Babies aren't built like that.

416
00:31:23,748 --> 00:31:25,010
And besides...

417
00:31:26,584 --> 00:31:30,111
if you're such a blue-nosed Puritan
about your sister...

418
00:31:30,922 --> 00:31:33,152
then just forget it.

419
00:31:34,092 --> 00:31:36,253
I didn't know she was coming up here,
understand?

420
00:31:36,327 --> 00:31:39,387
- I just wasn't prepared.
- I know.

421
00:31:40,231 --> 00:31:44,099
You're not prepared for a lot of things.
I'm beginning to get the idea.

422
00:31:58,283 --> 00:32:00,513
I'm sorry, I didn't mean to scare you, ma'am.

423
00:32:00,585 --> 00:32:03,213
It's all right. I don't scare easily.

424
00:32:03,888 --> 00:32:07,517
- I was looking for Mr. Grogan.
- He's in the kitchen.

425
00:32:09,560 --> 00:32:11,255
Do you work here?

426
00:32:11,329 --> 00:32:14,730
Well, kind of. I more or less get dirtied up
around the place.

427
00:32:16,234 --> 00:32:19,328
- Are you a fighter?
- Not really.

428
00:32:19,871 --> 00:32:21,930
A lot of people have different ideas
about it, though.

429
00:32:23,808 --> 00:32:25,002
I see.

430
00:32:26,577 --> 00:32:31,071
Do you belong up here?
I mean, I've never seen you around before.

431
00:32:32,750 --> 00:32:34,513
I'm Willy's sister.

432
00:32:36,020 --> 00:32:37,282
You are?

433
00:32:38,189 --> 00:32:39,656
What's funny?

434
00:32:41,192 --> 00:32:44,059
Nothing. Nothing at all.

435
00:32:46,831 --> 00:32:50,028
Galahad! Hey, Galahad.

436
00:32:51,369 --> 00:32:54,361
- Who's Galahad?
- That's me.

437
00:32:55,673 --> 00:32:57,038
Excuse me.

438
00:32:58,276 --> 00:33:00,403
- Nice to have met you.
- Thank you.

439
00:33:12,557 --> 00:33:14,115
He knows about cars?

440
00:33:14,192 --> 00:33:17,218
Are you kidding?
Like Edison knew about light sockets.

441
00:33:17,729 --> 00:33:21,688
For instance, he could put a carburetor right
up your nose without making you sneeze.

442
00:33:21,766 --> 00:33:23,893
- All right, knock it off.
- Yeah?

443
00:33:23,968 --> 00:33:27,267
Zimmerman says this heap conked
out on him. And he's not out of gasoline.

444
00:33:27,338 --> 00:33:28,430
Okay.

445
00:33:38,683 --> 00:33:41,208
- Rose!
- I'm out here.

446
00:34:02,440 --> 00:34:05,739
- So what's there to see?
- Just the country.

447
00:34:06,944 --> 00:34:09,674
- Things you don't see in the Bronx anymore.
- That's fine.

448
00:34:09,747 --> 00:34:11,738
I'll remember to send you a picture.

449
00:34:11,816 --> 00:34:14,307
Tomorrow you'll be back in the Bronx.

450
00:34:23,327 --> 00:34:27,525
Yeah? Jerry.
Jerry, I'm glad you got back to me.

451
00:34:27,698 --> 00:34:30,258
The reason I called
was about that 10-round television spot...

452
00:34:30,334 --> 00:34:32,131
you've got open next week.

453
00:34:32,203 --> 00:34:34,262
Local, not network.
That's what I figured you.

454
00:34:34,338 --> 00:34:37,535
Willy, let me talk to Zimmerman.
I want to use one of his boys.

455
00:34:37,608 --> 00:34:38,438
Zimmerman?

456
00:34:38,509 --> 00:34:41,376
Now what makes you think you're
gonna need one of those sleepwalkers...

457
00:34:41,446 --> 00:34:43,641
Zimmerman could offer you?

458
00:34:43,714 --> 00:34:47,047
Jerry, I wouldn't try to sell you
a short package anymore than I'd try...

459
00:34:47,118 --> 00:34:49,348
to frame the League of American Mothers.

460
00:34:49,420 --> 00:34:51,718
We've been friends too long for that.

461
00:34:51,789 --> 00:34:52,778
Jerry.

462
00:34:53,257 --> 00:34:58,593
Jerry, I know for a fact
Zimmerman left for Boston half an hour ago.

463
00:34:58,863 --> 00:35:00,626
He's still...

464
00:35:02,567 --> 00:35:04,933
- Good luck in Boston, Joie.
- Thank you, I'll need it.

465
00:35:05,002 --> 00:35:06,492
I'll miss you, Galahad.

466
00:35:06,571 --> 00:35:09,062
What did I tell you about the way
the kid tunes a car, huh?

467
00:35:09,140 --> 00:35:11,904
So it's running, I grant you. Thank you.

468
00:35:11,976 --> 00:35:13,534
What "thank you"? That's all?

469
00:35:13,611 --> 00:35:15,806
He can live on gasoline fumes? Pay him.

470
00:35:15,880 --> 00:35:17,905
It was nothing, Lew, it was nothing.

471
00:35:17,982 --> 00:35:20,041
In a service station,
would they say it was nothing?

472
00:35:20,118 --> 00:35:21,847
- Come on, pay him.
- Stay out of it, Lew.

473
00:35:21,919 --> 00:35:25,320
The kid said it was nothing,
then I'm satisfied it was nothing.

474
00:35:27,325 --> 00:35:30,385
Now there goes a real fast man
with a buck, that Zimmerman.

475
00:35:30,461 --> 00:35:32,554
- Hey, what's this thing?
- A U-bolt I want to retread.

476
00:35:32,630 --> 00:35:34,188
I wonder if Willy's got some tools
I could use.

477
00:35:34,265 --> 00:35:38,065
Tools? The only tools around here
are a can-opener and a shovel. Maybe.

478
00:35:38,736 --> 00:35:42,069
You want to monkey with tools?
You go right down the road to the village...

479
00:35:42,140 --> 00:35:44,973
- Prohosko's garage, tell him I sent you.
- Prohosko's?

480
00:35:45,042 --> 00:35:47,169
Yeah. Peter J. Prohosko.
A very good friend of mine.

481
00:35:47,245 --> 00:35:48,712
I saw it on the way in.

482
00:35:48,779 --> 00:35:51,907
I'll go down there as soon as I clean
up in the barn. Thanks, Lew.

483
00:35:54,719 --> 00:35:56,812
It just happens
there is a big strong kid available.

484
00:35:57,221 --> 00:35:59,189
A big strong kid?

485
00:35:59,590 --> 00:36:02,320
How come I never heard of him?
Where'd he come from?

486
00:36:02,393 --> 00:36:04,918
- Who handles him?
- I'm his manager, naturally.

487
00:36:04,996 --> 00:36:07,430
He's fresh out of the service.
He won 17 straight knockouts.

488
00:36:07,498 --> 00:36:11,628
Seventeen straight knockouts? Where?

489
00:36:11,702 --> 00:36:12,828
Where?

490
00:36:12,904 --> 00:36:14,963
Well, actually,
he did most of his fighting in Australia.

491
00:36:15,039 --> 00:36:16,597
He was stationed in that area for two years.

492
00:36:16,674 --> 00:36:18,232
Rose!

493
00:36:18,309 --> 00:36:19,936
Why would I lie?

494
00:36:21,112 --> 00:36:24,047
Quiet. Both of you. I'm talking business.

495
00:36:24,215 --> 00:36:27,810
Excuse me, Jerry. No, he fights
under the name of Kid Galahad.

496
00:36:28,085 --> 00:36:30,383
No, not Gavilan. Galahad.

497
00:36:31,189 --> 00:36:33,350
That's right, like in the storybook.

498
00:36:33,424 --> 00:36:36,154
You know, it's romantic,
and they'll love him on TV.

499
00:36:36,227 --> 00:36:38,422
Available to you for $1,000.

500
00:36:40,131 --> 00:36:44,568
Well, if you're in a jam, Jerry, I'll let him go
for $750, but not a quarter less.

501
00:36:45,236 --> 00:36:47,500
Albany was always a fair city.

502
00:36:48,105 --> 00:36:51,165
That's right. One week from tonight.
You've got a deal.

503
00:36:51,275 --> 00:36:52,867
Who's he supposed to fight in Albany?

504
00:36:52,944 --> 00:36:55,174
Oh, just some clown.
I'll talk to you about it later.

505
00:36:55,246 --> 00:36:58,079
Wait, let's talk about it now. What clown?

506
00:36:59,150 --> 00:37:02,244
Ezzard Bailey.
Ten rounds at the Capital Casino.

507
00:37:02,320 --> 00:37:06,188
- Willy, how can you do a thing like that?
- Lay off, Lew.

508
00:37:06,257 --> 00:37:08,987
The kid's never had a professional fight
in his life and you know it.

509
00:37:09,060 --> 00:37:10,721
And Ezzard Bailey is no clown.

510
00:37:10,795 --> 00:37:13,286
All right, so I get 33.3%.

511
00:37:13,731 --> 00:37:16,097
It just so happens I can use the money.

512
00:37:21,172 --> 00:37:23,732
Why do you both
have to look at me like that?

513
00:38:11,656 --> 00:38:13,521
He should feel this happy coming back.

514
00:38:24,802 --> 00:38:28,431
- This thing don't ride bad, does it?
- So did Fulton's steamboat.

515
00:38:28,506 --> 00:38:32,272
- What's that supposed to mean?
- Suppose somebody sees me in this thing?

516
00:39:15,152 --> 00:39:16,210
Make a fist.

517
00:39:16,287 --> 00:39:18,414
- Too tight?
- No, it feels all right.

518
00:39:19,123 --> 00:39:22,820
- Nervous?
- A little bit. Feel it right here, you know.

519
00:39:23,361 --> 00:39:25,352
Ain't the only place you're gonna feel it.

520
00:39:26,530 --> 00:39:29,260
Will you stop running, Willy?
How can I talk to you?

521
00:39:29,333 --> 00:39:33,030
Jerry, you got a nasty suspicious nature.
It's what's wrong with the world.

522
00:39:33,104 --> 00:39:34,537
Listen, lamb-eyes, how do I know...

523
00:39:34,605 --> 00:39:36,596
you can punch your way
through a cloud of cigar smoke?

524
00:39:36,674 --> 00:39:38,665
- Sixteen knockouts...
- I sent you his records, didn't I?

525
00:39:38,743 --> 00:39:41,109
Yeah, I know. 16 knockouts in Australia.

526
00:39:41,178 --> 00:39:43,738
- I never said that.
- Please, Willy, I'm asking him.

527
00:39:43,814 --> 00:39:46,681
Seventeen straight knockouts in Australia.
I can read, too.

528
00:39:46,751 --> 00:39:48,446
Thanks, Lew. It never hurts to be accurate.

529
00:39:48,519 --> 00:39:51,545
Who did you fight in Australia, kid?
A pack of sick kangaroos?

530
00:39:51,622 --> 00:39:53,817
He fought guys that'd make the skin
stand up on your head.

531
00:39:53,891 --> 00:39:55,620
- Name one.
- Name one.

532
00:39:55,693 --> 00:39:57,888
Elio "Tarzan-Boy" Pincus, for example.

533
00:39:57,962 --> 00:39:59,589
Elio was a sensation until this kid...

534
00:39:59,663 --> 00:40:02,427
Willy, I don't want to hear anymore
of your double talk. You name one.

535
00:40:02,500 --> 00:40:04,934
Don't answer that.
You've got your constitutional rights.

536
00:40:05,002 --> 00:40:08,199
Are you trying to bug my boy five
minutes before he steps into the ring?

537
00:40:08,272 --> 00:40:10,797
You want to take that up
with the boxing commissioner, right now?

538
00:40:10,875 --> 00:40:13,605
- Willy this is my fight...
- And that's my fighter.

539
00:40:13,711 --> 00:40:16,373
A clean-cut American boy,
straight out of the army.

540
00:40:17,615 --> 00:40:20,448
What'd you think when you read
all that phony publicity about yourself?

541
00:40:20,518 --> 00:40:22,213
You mean about the 17 knockouts?

542
00:40:22,286 --> 00:40:23,344
Yeah.

543
00:40:23,421 --> 00:40:25,719
At first, I kind of felt sorry for Willy.

544
00:40:26,390 --> 00:40:28,915
- Sorry for him?
- He's not a bad guy, Lew.

545
00:40:28,993 --> 00:40:31,257
Maybe he's got reasons for being a liar.

546
00:40:31,328 --> 00:40:34,820
- It'd be nice if we could help him out.
- Help him out?

547
00:40:35,032 --> 00:40:37,694
How about you? Look at that.

548
00:40:40,738 --> 00:40:42,205
Suppose you step out there in that ring...

549
00:40:42,273 --> 00:40:45,265
and Ezzard Bailey separates you
from what little brains you got left, huh?

550
00:40:46,277 --> 00:40:48,302
I've been thinking about that, too.

551
00:41:00,591 --> 00:41:02,388
Galahad, you're a bum.

552
00:41:02,460 --> 00:41:04,792
Why don't you go home
and get your shield?

553
00:41:04,862 --> 00:41:05,886
Oh, Galahad!

554
00:41:06,864 --> 00:41:07,990
Oh, Galahad.

555
00:41:08,065 --> 00:41:09,589
Don't let it bug you, kid.

556
00:41:09,667 --> 00:41:12,830
Cream puff from Cream Valley. Go on home.

557
00:41:19,210 --> 00:41:20,609
Rub your shoes in the rosin.

558
00:41:20,678 --> 00:41:22,942
Make it look like
you know what you're doing.

559
00:41:36,460 --> 00:41:40,829
<i>Ladies and gentlemen,</i>
<i>this is the feature attraction...</i>

560
00:41:40,898 --> 00:41:42,832
<i>the main event of the evening...</i>

561
00:41:42,900 --> 00:41:44,834

<i>Kid Galahad!</i>

571
00:42:17,201 --> 00:42:19,328
- He should be arrested.
- Who?

572
00:42:19,436 --> 00:42:22,303
Your brother, naturally.
He's responsible for this.

573
00:42:22,973 --> 00:42:26,101
<i>And now giving instructions,</i>
<i>your referee, Tommy Hart.</i>

574
00:42:26,176 --> 00:42:27,609
<i>All right, boys.</i>

575
00:42:27,678 --> 00:42:30,044
<i>We've already covered the instructions</i>
<i>in the dressing rooms.</i>

576

577
00:42:31,515 --> 00:42:35,542
<i>I want you to shake hands now,</i>
<i>go to your corners, and come out fighting.</i>

578
00:42:38,589 --> 00:42:40,022
Now, cover up your head once in a while.

579
00:42:40,090 --> 00:42:43,457
Like I told you,
it's not a disgrace to block a punch.

580
00:42:43,894 --> 00:42:45,191
Good luck, Kid.

581
00:42:55,739 --> 00:42:57,263
Grab him!

582
00:42:57,708 --> 00:42:59,471
Galahad, grab him!

583
00:43:17,161 --> 00:43:20,289
Willy, I'm telling you,
I can't stand to watch this much longer.

584
00:43:37,648 --> 00:43:38,945
Excuse me. Must've slipped down.

585
00:43:39,016 --> 00:43:41,814
Sure. One more slip like that
and he'll bury you.

586
00:43:41,885 --> 00:43:45,184
Five, six, seven...

587
00:43:45,623 --> 00:43:48,717
eight, nine... All right.

588
00:43:51,929 --> 00:43:53,726
- Felix.
- Yeah, Chief.

589
00:43:53,797 --> 00:43:55,321
Get me two boys ready
for an emergency bout.

590
00:43:55,399 --> 00:43:57,629
That lollipop, Galahad, won't last the round.

591
00:43:57,701 --> 00:43:59,896
They'll be screaming for their money back.
Oh, that Grogan.

592
00:43:59,970 --> 00:44:01,232
You wait till I get my hands on him.

593
00:44:01,305 --> 00:44:02,704
Johnny, let's go!

594
00:44:09,013 --> 00:44:10,241
Stop it.

595
00:44:11,649 --> 00:44:13,480
Why can't they stop it now?

596
00:44:29,400 --> 00:44:32,631
One, two, three...

597
00:44:33,137 --> 00:44:35,833
four, five, six...

598
00:44:35,906 --> 00:44:37,430
Get up.

599
00:44:37,574 --> 00:44:41,237
Eight, nine, ten. You're out.

600
00:44:44,281 --> 00:44:47,341
Correction, Jerry. 18 knockouts in a row.

601
00:44:59,997 --> 00:45:04,024
Hello, tiger. Let me see what's left of you.

602
00:45:04,735 --> 00:45:09,069
Well, I've seen fellows look worse
after a fall off a 40-foot ladder.

603
00:45:10,007 --> 00:45:11,872
- Wasn't a bad fight, son.
- Thank you, Mr. Prohosko.

604
00:45:11,942 --> 00:45:14,240
I think everybody enjoyed it
a little better than I did, though.

605
00:45:14,311 --> 00:45:16,643
- The greatest fight I ever saw on TV, kid.
- Thank you.

606
00:45:16,714 --> 00:45:19,274
Five different times
I thought you were dead.

607
00:45:19,349 --> 00:45:21,408
Did you hear where
they introduced him from last night?

608
00:45:21,485 --> 00:45:22,679
You bet I heard it.

609
00:45:22,753 --> 00:45:25,916
- Every single word of it.
- "From Cream Valley, New York...

610
00:45:25,989 --> 00:45:27,320
"Kid Galahad."

611
00:45:27,391 --> 00:45:30,383
Frankly, it did something to me.
Did you get the same feeling, Pete?

612
00:45:30,461 --> 00:45:32,190
I'd be a liar if I said I didn't.

613
00:45:32,262 --> 00:45:34,093
And that goes for me, too.

614
00:45:35,833 --> 00:45:37,027
- Nice going, kid.
- Thank you.

615
00:45:37,101 --> 00:45:40,127
All these other muscle-heads
been training up here, not one of them...

616
00:45:40,204 --> 00:45:41,671
said he was from Cream Valley.

617
00:45:41,739 --> 00:45:44,469
I want to pay you for those re-threads
you let me have last week.

618
00:45:44,541 --> 00:45:45,633
There's no hurry about it.

619
00:45:45,709 --> 00:45:47,734
I figure she'll be ready
for a spray job pretty soon.

620
00:45:47,811 --> 00:45:50,541
I want to know if it'd be all right
for me to use your garage tonight.

621
00:45:50,614 --> 00:45:52,878
For you? Why wouldn't it be all right?
The shop is yours.

622
00:45:52,950 --> 00:45:54,281
Thank you.

623
00:45:55,252 --> 00:45:57,914
Now, there goes my kind of a boy.

624
00:46:51,175 --> 00:46:54,906
Do you mean you're gonna walk right up
to him like bygones was bygones, Max?

625
00:46:54,978 --> 00:46:56,172
Like nothing ever happened?

626
00:46:56,246 --> 00:47:00,740
We live in an age where every dove
of peace has an angle or a proposition.

627
00:47:01,285 --> 00:47:03,617
I think we've got the kind he'll listen to.

628
00:47:06,089 --> 00:47:08,683
- Happy Fourth of July!
- Who's smiling?

629
00:47:08,926 --> 00:47:10,689
If that's going to be your attitude, Willy...

630
00:47:10,761 --> 00:47:13,457
Never mind my attitude.
All of a sudden, after three whole years...

631
00:47:13,530 --> 00:47:15,964
you get democratic enough
to set your foot in my joint? Why?

632
00:47:16,033 --> 00:47:19,901
If you'll kindly shut up long enough,
I'll give you two reasons.

633
00:47:20,070 --> 00:47:22,732
- We can go inside?
- Who's stopping you?

634
00:47:33,584 --> 00:47:38,317
First, as I was about to say, Willy,
it's the 4th of July, a day on which...

635
00:47:38,388 --> 00:47:41,915
I've got no objection
to visiting with a fellow veteran.

636
00:47:41,992 --> 00:47:43,084
Big deal.

637
00:47:43,160 --> 00:47:45,856
Secondly, I am here with Harry,
on behalf of...

638
00:47:45,963 --> 00:47:48,591
- the Cream Valley Chamber of Commerce.
- Another big deal.

639
00:47:48,665 --> 00:47:51,133
From which you would not have been
blackballed, incidentally...

640
00:47:51,201 --> 00:47:53,795
if it had not been
for that investigation in Washington.

641
00:47:53,871 --> 00:47:56,567
- I can stand the loss.
- Willy...

642
00:47:56,874 --> 00:48:00,742
- you better listen to Max.
- So? I'm listening.

643
00:48:04,214 --> 00:48:07,945
A suggestion was made, Willy,
on account of how everybody...

644
00:48:08,018 --> 00:48:11,215
myself included,
seems to like this young Galahad so much.

645
00:48:14,458 --> 00:48:16,426
A suggestion was made...

646
00:48:17,261 --> 00:48:21,721
that this year, over the Labor Day weekend,
we might sponsor a boxing show.

647
00:48:22,332 --> 00:48:25,631
- With Galahad?
- No, with Max Schmeling. Who else?

648
00:48:26,570 --> 00:48:29,801
What the committee has in mind
is Galahad and a suitable opponent...

649
00:48:29,873 --> 00:48:31,363
at the fairgrounds.

650
00:48:31,875 --> 00:48:35,709
We would draw from the whole resort
area, of course, not just from here.

651
00:48:35,779 --> 00:48:39,943
Well, all I can tell you sharpshooters
right now is that Galahad will be expensive.

652
00:48:40,017 --> 00:48:42,918
We didn't expect to pay the boy off
in Green Stamps.

653
00:48:43,620 --> 00:48:46,555
- How about it, Willy?
- I'll take it.

654
00:48:48,191 --> 00:48:49,715
But as I say...

655
00:48:50,894 --> 00:48:53,727
he's gonna cost you.
I just haven't figured out how much yet.

656
00:49:09,313 --> 00:49:11,110
It's pretty, isn't it?

657
00:51:23,180 --> 00:51:24,670
- Hey, Galahad!
- What?

658
00:51:25,849 --> 00:51:28,682
- Hello, Lew.
- You coming to the picnic with us?

659
00:51:28,752 --> 00:51:30,447
Nope. I'm going in that.

660
00:51:31,955 --> 00:51:33,217
In that?

661
00:51:35,125 --> 00:51:37,787
First time I've had her on the road
since her new paint job, Lew.

662
00:51:37,861 --> 00:51:41,024
I thought I'd give this picnic
some real class, you know?

663
00:51:41,131 --> 00:51:44,726
Well, if Rose don't mind looking like
she's sitting in a can of ripe tomatoes...

664
00:51:44,801 --> 00:51:46,132
you know, why not?

665
00:51:46,203 --> 00:51:48,603
All right, we'll see you there.

666
00:52:04,387 --> 00:52:05,445
Hey!

667
00:52:12,462 --> 00:52:15,761
Why did she have to go off
in that beet-juice jalopy with him?

668
00:52:15,832 --> 00:52:17,129
You're asking me?

669
00:52:17,200 --> 00:52:19,896
She could've gone with Maynard and Lew,
couldn't she?

670
00:52:19,970 --> 00:52:22,803
Willy, when you're 21
and you look like Rose...

671
00:52:22,873 --> 00:52:25,103
you don't have to ride
with Lew and Maynard.

672
00:52:25,175 --> 00:52:27,075
What's that supposed to mean?

673
00:52:27,644 --> 00:52:29,043
You want diagrams?

674
00:52:35,419 --> 00:52:38,183
- Now look, Dolly...
- That's just what I'm going to do.

675
00:52:38,256 --> 00:52:42,124
Look at Maynard's corned beef.
I promised I'd put a low flame under it.

676
00:52:43,794 --> 00:52:45,193
Mr. Grogan?

677
00:52:47,398 --> 00:52:49,093
- Mr. Grogan?
- That's right.

678
00:52:49,167 --> 00:52:51,158
My name is Frank Gerson.
I'm a guest of Lieberman's.

679
00:52:51,235 --> 00:52:52,532
What can I do for you?

680
00:52:52,603 --> 00:52:55,766
I also happen to be one of the assistant
District Attorneys for Manhattan.

681
00:52:55,840 --> 00:52:58,968
That's a great help to everybody.
We've got nothing to talk about.

682
00:52:59,043 --> 00:53:00,510
I doubt that.

683
00:53:00,578 --> 00:53:03,274
New York's as curious as Washington
about Otto Danzig.

684
00:53:03,347 --> 00:53:05,713
Sorry. I never knew the answers
in the first place.

685
00:53:05,783 --> 00:53:07,876
If you don't know
who did that job on Rocky...

686
00:53:07,952 --> 00:53:10,614
why are these imported hoodlums
sitting on your front doorstep...

687
00:53:10,688 --> 00:53:13,088
twenty-three and a half hours every day?

688
00:53:14,325 --> 00:53:16,987
Do you mind if I tell you something
off the record?

689
00:53:17,161 --> 00:53:18,492
Please do.

690
00:53:19,263 --> 00:53:21,595
Otto doesn't believe me, either.

691
00:53:37,448 --> 00:53:39,609
Plenty of food, plenty of food.

692
00:53:39,684 --> 00:53:43,916
You think you've eaten lobster before,
Maynard, just wait till you taste this.

693
00:53:44,689 --> 00:53:46,179
Well, Maynard?

694
00:53:49,961 --> 00:53:52,828
I ain't saying this lobster is for the birds...

695
00:53:52,897 --> 00:53:55,422
but I'd rather be eating my own corned beef.

696
00:53:58,302 --> 00:54:01,362
Lobster? I think I'd like some of that.
Is it good?

697
00:54:01,439 --> 00:54:02,906
Fine, Father.

698
00:56:30,020 --> 00:56:32,454
Come on, let's do it again, Galahad.
We're just getting warm.

699
00:56:32,523 --> 00:56:34,923
You get any warmer,
you're gonna melt the guitar.

700
00:56:45,403 --> 00:56:46,597
Walter?

701
00:56:47,338 --> 00:56:49,363
That fight that Mr. Lieberman
and the others...

702
00:56:49,440 --> 00:56:51,135
were talking about
for the Labor Day weekend?

703
00:56:52,710 --> 00:56:55,008
I mean, what's the point of it?

704
00:56:55,379 --> 00:56:57,506
What do you mean, for me,
or for the Chamber of Commerce?

705
00:56:57,581 --> 00:56:59,048
For you, of course.

706
00:56:59,483 --> 00:57:01,417
Well, it means a lot of money.

707
00:57:01,786 --> 00:57:03,276
Do you want to fight?

708
00:57:03,354 --> 00:57:06,187
Get all banged up again,
like you fell down three flights of stairs?

709
00:57:06,257 --> 00:57:07,952
- Is that what you want?
- Nope.

710
00:57:08,025 --> 00:57:09,822
Then don't do it. Tell them no.

711
00:57:09,894 --> 00:57:12,954
Well, there's only one thing wrong with that.
I wouldn't get the money.

712
00:57:13,030 --> 00:57:15,362
- Who cares?
- Me. I care.

713
00:57:16,233 --> 00:57:18,030
I need it. I've made plans.

714
00:57:23,274 --> 00:57:24,832
You think I did all right?

715
00:57:24,909 --> 00:57:27,002
You cooked this great. It cuts real fine.

716
00:57:27,077 --> 00:57:28,442
Let's get one thing settled, Lew.

717
00:57:28,512 --> 00:57:31,106
Exactly what time was it
when you saw Rose leave the picnic?

718
00:57:31,182 --> 00:57:34,811
I told you before. 6:30, 6:45, 6:50...
I didn't make a note of it.

719
00:57:34,885 --> 00:57:37,376
What's all the commotion about?
She was with Galahad, wasn't she?

720
00:57:37,455 --> 00:57:40,083
I know who she was with.
And I'll tell you something else I know...

721
00:57:40,157 --> 00:57:41,419
it's 8:40.

722
00:57:41,492 --> 00:57:43,790
- Could she be safer with the FBI?
- Which way were they going?

723
00:57:43,861 --> 00:57:45,829
I told you that before, too.
Back toward the village.

724
00:57:45,896 --> 00:57:46,920
You're sure?

725
00:57:46,997 --> 00:57:49,363
Man, how could anybody in our racket
not recognize that jalopy?

726
00:57:49,433 --> 00:57:52,800
- It's the same color as a bloody nose.
- Very funny. How would you like one?

727
00:57:53,070 --> 00:57:54,469
Little father.

728
00:58:16,694 --> 00:58:19,857
Few things I wanted to finish
before Lew puts me back in training.

729
00:58:20,464 --> 00:58:23,194
Mr. Prohosko doesn't mind
you coming in here like this...

730
00:58:23,267 --> 00:58:25,633
- and using the place after hours?
- Mind?

731
00:58:26,437 --> 00:58:27,904
Mr. Prohosko?

732
00:58:28,906 --> 00:58:31,466
I wasn't gonna tell you
about Mr. Prohosko yet...

733
00:58:31,542 --> 00:58:34,102
but after September,
we're gonna be partners.

734
00:58:35,145 --> 00:58:37,511
You and Mr. Prohosko, partners?

735
00:58:38,182 --> 00:58:42,414
If everything works out all right, he wants
to retire, so that's why I need the money.

736
00:58:43,721 --> 00:58:46,281
- And no more fights?
- No more fights.

737
00:58:46,924 --> 00:58:48,949
There won't be any need for any.

738
00:58:50,194 --> 00:58:52,287
Well, it's like it had to happen.

739
00:58:54,798 --> 00:58:57,631
- Well, what I'm trying to say is...
- Yes?

740
00:59:01,405 --> 00:59:04,203
What I mean is,
I dropped the bolt. Excuse me.

741
00:59:04,341 --> 00:59:08,004
- What kind of a bolt was it, Walter?
- Quarter inch.

742
00:59:10,481 --> 00:59:11,948
How big was it?

743
00:59:12,016 --> 00:59:15,349
A quarter inch bolt is a quarter inch.

744
00:59:16,053 --> 00:59:17,350
It's about this big.

745
00:59:18,489 --> 00:59:19,683
Walter.

746
00:59:30,668 --> 00:59:33,034
What do you do when you feel like this?

747
00:59:34,238 --> 00:59:36,536
People usually get married, I understand.

748
00:59:36,907 --> 00:59:39,740
It's about the best and safest thing to do.

749
01:00:09,673 --> 01:00:11,664
Picnics are wonderful, Willy.

750
01:00:13,811 --> 01:00:15,176
Good night.

751
01:00:23,687 --> 01:00:25,154
Come here, Galahad.

752
01:00:28,492 --> 01:00:32,155
Who invited you to go cruising
in that jalopy with my sister today?

753
01:00:33,163 --> 01:00:34,630
I'm sorry, Willy. What?

754
01:00:34,698 --> 01:00:36,359
You heard me. Where did you go with her?

755
01:00:37,368 --> 01:00:38,926
Well, for one thing, we went to the picnic.

756
01:00:39,003 --> 01:00:40,595
That's not the one thing I'm concerned with.

757
01:00:40,671 --> 01:00:43,196
Lew and Maynard have been back for hours.
Where else did you go?

758
01:00:43,273 --> 01:00:44,740
- Now, wait a minute.
- I don't expect to wait.

759
01:00:45,009 --> 01:00:47,204
The thing for us to do right now
is get straightened out.

760
01:00:47,277 --> 01:00:49,404
You're here for one reason,
to train for a fight...

761
01:00:49,480 --> 01:00:50,970
and you'll take your orders from me.

762
01:00:51,048 --> 01:00:53,539
One of those orders is:
Keep away from Rose.

763
01:00:53,617 --> 01:00:55,107
I'm sorry you feel that way, Willy.

764
01:00:55,185 --> 01:00:57,312
I think Rose is old enough
to make a decision for herself.

765
01:00:57,388 --> 01:00:58,514
Is she?

766
01:00:58,589 --> 01:01:00,557
So the two of you can sneak off
in that red tin can...

767
01:01:00,624 --> 01:01:03,115
looking for any cabbage patch
the two of you can find?

768
01:01:03,761 --> 01:01:05,228
You've got a dirty mind, Willy.

769
01:01:05,295 --> 01:01:07,320
We were cutting up real wild tonight.

770
01:01:07,398 --> 01:01:09,229
First of all,
we went to Henry's Hamburger Haven...

771
01:01:09,299 --> 01:01:12,791
we held hands on top of the table
for an hour and a half. Is that so bad, huh?

772
01:01:12,870 --> 01:01:13,962
Don't get cute with me, you punk.

773
01:01:14,104 --> 01:01:15,799
- After that we went to Prohosko's.
- Prohosko's?

774
01:01:15,873 --> 01:01:17,864
Did you bother getting out of the car?

775
01:01:17,941 --> 01:01:19,966
You have got a dirty mind.

776
01:01:20,644 --> 01:01:24,410
The important thing for you to know, Willy,
is we decided to get married in September.

777
01:01:27,217 --> 01:01:28,445
Married?

778
01:01:30,521 --> 01:01:34,184
You decided to get married?

779
01:01:34,258 --> 01:01:38,126
We decided, Willy. We.
It's a two-party arrangement, you know.

780
01:01:38,195 --> 01:01:40,561
You've been sniffing
too many gasoline fumes, Galahad.

781
01:01:40,631 --> 01:01:43,259
My sister's not marrying any meatball.
Is that plain enough?

782
01:01:43,333 --> 01:01:45,392
Don't call me a meatball, Willy. I don't like it.

783
01:01:45,469 --> 01:01:48,802
I got plans for what I intend to do,
and it's not stopping punches with my head.

784
01:01:48,872 --> 01:01:52,035
So you wind up a grease monkey
in some broken-down garage.

785
01:01:52,109 --> 01:01:55,237
That's for my sister?
I'm supposed to roll out the champagne?

786
01:01:55,312 --> 01:01:56,643
Roll out the champagne or stale beer.

787
01:01:56,714 --> 01:02:00,115
I don't care what you roll out, that's left
up to you. The rest depends on Rose.

788
01:02:01,051 --> 01:02:04,612
Nobody asked you to come here.
All you had were your empty pockets...

789
01:02:04,688 --> 01:02:08,089
- and a shine on the seat of your pants.
- Don't push me, Willy.

790
01:02:08,692 --> 01:02:11,456
I'm a grease monkey
that won't slide so easily.

791
01:02:11,528 --> 01:02:14,156
How long you think it's taken me
to find out the score up here?

792
01:02:14,231 --> 01:02:15,960
This is a business, Willy.

793
01:02:16,133 --> 01:02:19,500
Feeding yourself from the blood and sweat
of these "meatballs," as you call them?

794
01:02:19,570 --> 01:02:21,037
Is that the smart way, Willy?

795
01:02:21,105 --> 01:02:22,470
With two hoodlums riding you so close...

796
01:02:22,539 --> 01:02:24,564
you can't even scratch
without a written permission?

797
01:02:24,641 --> 01:02:27,701
Running back and forth to a bookie joint
like a scared kid late for school.

798
01:02:27,778 --> 01:02:29,575
- Shut up.
- No, that's not for me, Willy.

799
01:02:29,646 --> 01:02:32,240
If I spill anybody's blood after Labor Day,
it'll be my own.

800
01:02:32,316 --> 01:02:34,784
- One reason, I'm not frightened by work.
- Shut up, I said.

801
01:02:34,852 --> 01:02:36,581
You can't yell loud enough
to make me shut up.

802
01:02:36,653 --> 01:02:39,486
And I'll tell you what I think
of the fight game. I think it stinks.

803
01:02:39,556 --> 01:02:42,184
And when I get out of it what I want,
I'm quitting. I'm through.

804
01:02:43,827 --> 01:02:47,194
No, I'm not marrying Rose
because she's your sister, Willy...

805
01:02:48,031 --> 01:02:49,055
but in spite of it.

806
01:02:51,201 --> 01:02:53,567
I'm waiting, Willy. I'm waiting.

807
01:02:54,972 --> 01:02:56,200
Stop it.

808
01:02:57,241 --> 01:02:59,801
- What's the matter with you, anyway?
- What's the matter with me?

809
01:03:00,310 --> 01:03:04,770
This cream-headed clown wants to marry
my sister. That's what's the matter with me.

810
01:03:08,085 --> 01:03:11,816
At least he's not asking her to hang
around for three or four years, Willy.

811
01:03:58,735 --> 01:04:00,168
Well, Willy?

812
01:04:00,637 --> 01:04:02,764
Look, Marvin, I may be annoyed at this boy,
like I say.

813
01:04:02,840 --> 01:04:06,332
I may have had a real bellyful of all
that's sweet and beautiful about him, but...

814
01:04:06,410 --> 01:04:07,468
I told you.

815
01:04:07,544 --> 01:04:09,341
Galahad's opponent
will be Sugarboy Romero.

816
01:04:09,413 --> 01:04:12,678
How do you know that? Jerry Bathgate's
handling it for the Chamber of Commerce.

817
01:04:12,749 --> 01:04:13,807
Jerry's had his instructions.

818
01:04:13,884 --> 01:04:16,011
He doesn't dare blow his nose
two nostrils at a time...

819
01:04:16,086 --> 01:04:18,020
- unless Otto gives him the word.
- Come off it.

820
01:04:18,088 --> 01:04:21,216
If these two guys were handcuffed together,
Galahad couldn't hit Romero...

821
01:04:21,291 --> 01:04:23,384
with a six-quart bucket of beans.

822
01:04:23,527 --> 01:04:25,324
Then you know about the Sugarboy, huh?

823
01:04:25,395 --> 01:04:26,726
Why wouldn't I know about him?

824
01:04:26,797 --> 01:04:30,494
I saw him out on the coast last year, once
in Los Angeles, another time in Tijuana.

825
01:04:30,567 --> 01:04:32,432
He was handled by his uncle, or somebody.

826
01:04:32,502 --> 01:04:34,697
He's no longer handled by his uncle.

827
01:04:37,040 --> 01:04:38,337
Look...

828
01:04:38,408 --> 01:04:41,571
nobody's trying to hurt your boy,
or kill a golden goose.

829
01:04:42,346 --> 01:04:44,906
All Otto wants is a nice payday
for Sugarboy.

830
01:04:45,148 --> 01:04:49,209
And the chance to cover all the bets the
local sports will want to make on Galahad.

831
01:04:49,286 --> 01:04:51,686
- Now that makes sense, doesn't it?
- Yeah...

832
01:04:52,322 --> 01:04:54,085
- for Otto.
- Otto?

833
01:04:58,495 --> 01:05:00,895
What, are you putting me on, or something?

834
01:05:01,064 --> 01:05:04,522
You're in hock up to your eyebrows
with six bookmakers I can name.

835
01:05:04,601 --> 01:05:07,399
Horses won't pay off for you
the way this thing will.

836
01:05:07,471 --> 01:05:11,464
You put your end of your purse on Romero.
It's your only chance to get even.

837
01:05:12,242 --> 01:05:16,201
Look, Willy,
like it or not, Otto has adopted you.

838
01:05:17,080 --> 01:05:18,445
You're one of the family.

839
01:05:31,228 --> 01:05:32,820
Use the left hook.

840
01:05:33,096 --> 01:05:34,586
That's it. Left, then right.

841
01:05:43,273 --> 01:05:45,104
Hold it. Come over here a minute.

842
01:05:48,645 --> 01:05:50,613
Give me some right crosses.

843
01:05:50,681 --> 01:05:52,706
Just cross your right over here.

844
01:05:56,019 --> 01:05:58,715
Just hold the left there, then the right ones.

845
01:06:01,124 --> 01:06:02,216
Good.

846
01:06:05,262 --> 01:06:08,254
- That's all for today, kid.
- I only went a couple rounds.

847
01:06:08,332 --> 01:06:12,996
Don't worry about it. If you get any sharper,
you're liable to punch yourself in the leg.

848
01:06:13,804 --> 01:06:15,772
Go ahead. Take a shower.

849
01:06:16,773 --> 01:06:18,502
Don't cool it. Run.

850
01:06:23,747 --> 01:06:25,146
Nice going, kid.

851
01:06:25,215 --> 01:06:29,083
I bet you worked up a big appetite.
I've got a steak for you like a...

852
01:06:38,862 --> 01:06:41,092
"Memories of Atlantic City."

853
01:06:41,164 --> 01:06:42,859
Oh, love in bloom again.

854
01:06:44,401 --> 01:06:45,629
Now get out.

855
01:06:45,702 --> 01:06:47,897
Who asked you to come in here
while I was dressing, anyway?

856
01:06:47,971 --> 01:06:49,404
- When did this start?
- Right now.

857
01:06:49,473 --> 01:06:51,839
Why don't you throw something else?
It'll make you feel better.

858
01:06:51,908 --> 01:06:53,671
- I'm all out of cheap souvenirs.
- Look, Dolly...

859
01:06:53,744 --> 01:06:54,768
Never mind, the "look, Dolly."

860
01:06:54,845 --> 01:06:57,939
I've had three years of "look, Dolly,"
and I get more allergic to it every day.

861
01:06:58,015 --> 01:07:00,779
So that's why all of a sudden
you're going back to work for Lieberman?

862
01:07:00,851 --> 01:07:01,840
Just leave well enough alone.

863
01:07:01,918 --> 01:07:04,045
- Get away from me.
- You don't mean it, angel.

864
01:07:04,121 --> 01:07:05,986
This is one song and dance
we will not go into.

865
01:07:06,056 --> 01:07:09,321
- Come on, now.
- Willy, put your hands back in your pockets.

866
01:07:09,526 --> 01:07:12,689
This is no time for your usual shell game.
I've had it too many times.

867
01:07:12,763 --> 01:07:14,492
You know, three years...

868
01:07:15,098 --> 01:07:17,623
Three years ago, when I quit Lieberman's...

869
01:07:18,135 --> 01:07:21,901
we were gonna turn
this miserable cauliflower patch...

870
01:07:21,972 --> 01:07:23,530
into something we'd be proud of.

871
01:07:23,607 --> 01:07:25,438
Be fair. I'm only trying to get on my feet.

872
01:07:25,509 --> 01:07:28,637
You've been on and off your feet
like Humpty Dumpty for three long years.

873
01:07:28,712 --> 01:07:30,703
Come on, will you stop giving me
the same needle.

874
01:07:30,781 --> 01:07:33,579
We were going to turn this place
into another Lieberman's. Remember?

875
01:07:33,650 --> 01:07:35,982
With the added touch
of your sweet Irish charm.

876
01:07:36,053 --> 01:07:37,782
- Yeah.
- But I'll tell you what this place is...

877
01:07:37,854 --> 01:07:39,151
if you must know.

878
01:07:39,222 --> 01:07:42,214
This is Lieberman's.
After the garbage hit the fan.

879
01:07:42,292 --> 01:07:46,251
So I missed the boat a couple of times.
Does that mean it's too late now?

880
01:07:46,329 --> 01:07:48,490
A thousand horse races too late.

881
01:07:48,565 --> 01:07:50,294
All the times you conned me...

882
01:07:50,367 --> 01:07:53,894
so many times we could've papered
this barn with losing tickets.

883
01:07:53,970 --> 01:07:56,700
You don't just throw away
three years like this, angel.

884
01:07:56,773 --> 01:07:58,707
- You don't, huh?
- No.

885
01:07:58,775 --> 01:08:02,267
Well, let me tell you something.
It's already thrown away.

886
01:08:02,345 --> 01:08:04,279
A little sweat and honest effort...

887
01:08:04,347 --> 01:08:07,316
would have been worth
all the speeches and the promises.

888
01:08:07,384 --> 01:08:10,547
And if you haven't had it by now, I have.

889
01:08:14,724 --> 01:08:17,022
Well, a little something I overlooked.

890
01:08:17,661 --> 01:08:19,288
Tijuana, Mexico.

891
01:08:20,397 --> 01:08:22,422
I was your fiancée.

892
01:08:23,700 --> 01:08:25,531
Pardon the expression.

893
01:08:26,269 --> 01:08:27,964
Girl in cabin six.

894
01:08:28,538 --> 01:08:30,369
So much for Tijuana.

895
01:08:31,108 --> 01:08:32,769
That's where we first saw Sugarboy Romero.

896
01:08:32,909 --> 01:08:33,898
That's right.

897
01:08:34,144 --> 01:08:38,080
One look at Sugarboy and you can see
why Mexico only needs a small army.

898
01:08:38,148 --> 01:08:39,672
- Very funny.
- Willy...

899
01:08:41,751 --> 01:08:45,380
Willy, I know you're not fond of marriage...

900
01:08:45,455 --> 01:08:48,424
for any member of your family,
but last night...

901
01:08:48,492 --> 01:08:52,019
Last night, when I needed you,
you let me down like a rock.

902
01:08:52,095 --> 01:08:55,656
- I was only trying to tell that young punk...
- I know what you were telling him.

903
01:08:55,732 --> 01:08:58,360
You were so teed off at the idea
of Rose getting married...

904
01:08:58,435 --> 01:09:01,302
that you arranged to have his brains
knocked out by Romero.

905
01:09:02,873 --> 01:09:06,809
It's just that you and marriage
have never learned to mix.

906
01:09:11,781 --> 01:09:13,112
All right.

907
01:09:16,520 --> 01:09:17,578
All right, what?

908
01:09:17,654 --> 01:09:20,953
I lay you 3-to-1, angel,
I never bet on another horse.

909
01:09:30,834 --> 01:09:33,359
What's the matter? What did I do now?

910
01:09:37,174 --> 01:09:40,575
You'll probably never know. Excuse me.

911
01:10:09,673 --> 01:10:11,903
- Sorry, Chuck.
- It's okay, kid.

912
01:10:19,382 --> 01:10:20,508
Time.

913
01:10:24,621 --> 01:10:28,819
When he throws a left hook,
that right of yours is great. It's great.

914
01:10:29,593 --> 01:10:32,790
- Willy, we're just doing great.
- That's fine.

915
01:10:36,600 --> 01:10:39,967
Start working on the left hook.
All lefts. Left jabs.

916
01:10:40,937 --> 01:10:41,995
Time.

917
01:10:51,815 --> 01:10:53,840
Frankly, the kid's much improved.

918
01:10:54,317 --> 01:10:58,777
This way he don't figure to get murdered
by Romero. Just a few weeks in the clinic.

919
01:11:00,056 --> 01:11:02,422
Look at him. Look at that kid work, huh?

920
01:11:02,759 --> 01:11:03,851
Fine.

921
01:11:14,437 --> 01:11:15,461
Garfield.

922
01:11:15,538 --> 01:11:18,405
It wouldn't look right, me going upstairs
in uniform to a bookie joint.

923
01:11:18,475 --> 01:11:20,739
Not this time of the morning, anyhow.

924
01:11:21,177 --> 01:11:24,112
- Maybe yes, maybe no.
- I'd like to bet a few dollars on Galahad.

925
01:11:24,180 --> 01:11:25,511
All right, give it to me later.

926
01:11:25,582 --> 01:11:28,483
You know, everybody in this town
is trying to throw their cash at me.

927
01:11:28,551 --> 01:11:30,451
From the barber to the mayor.

928
01:11:32,589 --> 01:11:33,886
The mayor, too?

929
01:13:07,217 --> 01:13:10,482
- Well, here we are.
- We are?

930
01:13:11,788 --> 01:13:13,449
We talk to him here?

931
01:13:14,491 --> 01:13:17,551
- Fill out the papers and things now?
- I'm pretty sure.

932
01:13:26,536 --> 01:13:28,902
Excuse me. Could we see Father Higgins?

933
01:13:28,972 --> 01:13:31,167
Of course. Won't you come in?

934
01:13:38,481 --> 01:13:40,449
- Please sit down.
- Thank you.

935
01:13:40,517 --> 01:13:41,848
Thank you.

936
01:13:52,228 --> 01:13:55,129
Rose Grogan!
Why didn't you say it was you?

937
01:13:56,132 --> 01:14:00,398
Well, you've grown up to be the fine big girl
your father always said you'd be.

938
01:14:00,503 --> 01:14:01,834
Thank you.

939
01:14:02,205 --> 01:14:04,435
Father, this is Walter Gulick.

940
01:14:04,841 --> 01:14:06,172
- Father.
- I know.

941
01:14:06,242 --> 01:14:09,803
I saw the two of you in church
a few times, and I took the trouble to ask.

942
01:14:09,879 --> 01:14:13,042
I've heard them talking about you
all over town, Galahad.

943
01:14:13,349 --> 01:14:16,443
It mightn't hurt if you carried
your shield a little higher.

944
01:14:16,519 --> 01:14:18,749
Father, the reason we dropped in
to see you this morning...

945
01:14:18,822 --> 01:14:21,290
I know the reason you dropped in to see me.

946
01:14:21,357 --> 01:14:23,518
One look at you
and it's obvious you didn't come here...

947
01:14:23,593 --> 01:14:26,061
to make arrangements for a wake. Sit down.

948
01:14:27,497 --> 01:14:29,624
How long have you known him, Rose?

949
01:14:30,667 --> 01:14:31,861
A few months.

950
01:14:31,935 --> 01:14:34,267
Well, that could be too short a time
in some situations...

951
01:14:34,337 --> 01:14:36,271
and too long a time in others.

952
01:14:37,040 --> 01:14:40,100
- When do you plan being married?
- Next month, Father.

953
01:14:40,410 --> 01:14:43,379
It'll take a month, anyhow,
with the publishing of the banns.

954
01:14:43,446 --> 01:14:46,210
- You know what you're getting into, I hope.
- I'm sure I do.

955
01:14:46,282 --> 01:14:50,343
And you know how it is in this league, Rose.
There's no second time around.

956
01:14:50,687 --> 01:14:54,384
You buy a pig in a poke
and you darn well better learn to like pork.

957
01:14:55,325 --> 01:14:58,590
- I love him.
- Well, it's a wonderful motive.

958
01:14:58,895 --> 01:15:00,920
Not the most original, but certainly the best.

959
01:15:01,698 --> 01:15:04,258
I guess we can start filling out the papers.

960
01:15:04,367 --> 01:15:07,200
- You were baptized someplace, I gather?
- Yes, Father.

961
01:15:07,270 --> 01:15:10,239
- I have the certificate with me.
- Where were you baptized?

962
01:15:10,306 --> 01:15:11,671
Right here.

963
01:15:11,741 --> 01:15:14,869
No, you misunderstand me, son.
I asked where you were baptized.

964
01:15:14,944 --> 01:15:17,310
Yes, I know. Right here in Cream Valley.

965
01:15:17,747 --> 01:15:19,271
I don't get it.

966
01:15:20,016 --> 01:15:22,746
All I've heard in town,
in Dolce's Barber Shop, for instance...

967
01:15:22,819 --> 01:15:24,480
where they've got your picture on the wall...

968
01:15:24,554 --> 01:15:26,454
is that you came from some little town
in Kentucky.

969
01:15:26,956 --> 01:15:29,948
Well, that's where I was brought up,
but I was born here, Father.

970
01:15:30,827 --> 01:15:35,287
"Church of St. Stanislaus, August the 14th,
1939, Walter Joseph Gulick."

971
01:15:35,365 --> 01:15:39,199
Well, I'll have to check this with the records,
of course. Meanwhile...

972
01:15:39,269 --> 01:15:41,260
congratulations to both of you.

973
01:15:42,105 --> 01:15:43,902
- And welcome home.
- Thank you, Father.

974
01:15:52,916 --> 01:15:54,679
Keep crowding him, keep crowding him.

975
01:15:58,888 --> 01:15:59,980
Move.

976
01:16:02,225 --> 01:16:04,523
- You know the Model T Ford he fixed up?
- Yeah.

977
01:16:04,594 --> 01:16:07,495
Turned down $1,000 from an antique dealer.

978
01:16:07,564 --> 01:16:09,498
He's gonna be my partner, too.

979
01:16:09,866 --> 01:16:10,992
What?

980
01:16:11,067 --> 01:16:14,264
I'll tell you one thing
about this young Galahad...

981
01:16:14,337 --> 01:16:16,601
a Benny Leonard he ain't, but he's willing.

982
01:16:16,673 --> 01:16:18,163
Yeah, you bet.

983
01:16:18,975 --> 01:16:21,409
That's it. Keep crowding him.
Keep crowding him, kid.

984
01:16:28,685 --> 01:16:30,050
Get it up. Get it up there.

985
01:16:35,959 --> 01:16:38,587
Right up. Keep the right up. All right, time.

986
01:16:40,697 --> 01:16:42,892
Thanks, Orlando. That's all for now.

987
01:16:45,034 --> 01:16:46,228
How was I doing?

988
01:16:46,302 --> 01:16:49,203
You were all right, dancing around
with a welterweight, with speed.

989
01:16:49,272 --> 01:16:52,435
But, now I've got a guy coming into the ring
with six hands and a buggy whip.

990
01:16:52,508 --> 01:16:55,136
It's his job to slap you silly,
until you're really in shape.

991
01:16:55,211 --> 01:16:57,236
What are you talking about, Lew?

992
01:16:59,115 --> 01:17:01,675
You heard what he said,
and he's not kidding.

993
01:17:01,784 --> 01:17:03,115
- Joie!
- Galahad, how are you?

994
01:17:03,186 --> 01:17:04,483
- Just fine.
- Good to see you.

995
01:17:04,554 --> 01:17:07,079
- Great fight in Boston, man.
- Knocked him out in the first round.

996
01:17:07,156 --> 01:17:09,386
I thought I'd come up and help you out
before the big fight.

997
01:17:09,459 --> 01:17:11,927
- You ain't gonna knock me out, are you?
- Let's see what happens.

998
01:17:11,995 --> 01:17:13,155
Let's go. Honeymoon's over. Time.

999
01:17:18,368 --> 01:17:20,302
Joie, throw a left hook.

1000
01:17:21,104 --> 01:17:24,733
Oh, no you don't.
This guy did this to me once before.

1001
01:17:24,807 --> 01:17:26,866
He's rough.
You better get me a headgear, pal.

1002
01:17:26,943 --> 01:17:29,138
- Hey, where did you learn that jab?
- Come on, I'll show you.

1003
01:17:29,212 --> 01:17:30,372
You've been doing a lot of work.

1004
01:17:30,446 --> 01:17:34,678
So what? These two clowns together
couldn't handle Romero with a baseball bat.

1005
01:17:36,119 --> 01:17:37,381
I wonder.

1006
01:17:49,098 --> 01:17:51,157
- Well, Father!
- Hello, Father.

1007
01:17:51,234 --> 01:17:52,963
- Hello, Max.
- It's Father Higgins!

1008
01:17:57,006 --> 01:18:00,066
That's the stuff. Come on, Galahad.
Keep that guard up.

1009
01:18:03,046 --> 01:18:04,707
Good boy, Galahad.

1010
01:18:10,153 --> 01:18:12,485
Hey, who's working out who here?

1011
01:18:14,957 --> 01:18:18,188
Left. Jab left, Galahad.

1012
01:18:18,594 --> 01:18:20,323
Now cross. Hit him!

1013
01:18:21,998 --> 01:18:24,523
I never knew you were such a fight fan, Max.

1014
01:18:25,301 --> 01:18:26,825
Well, it's only...

1015
01:18:26,903 --> 01:18:30,168
Well, it's the Chamber of Commerce,
for one thing...

1016
01:18:31,140 --> 01:18:33,074
and I happen to like this boy.

1017
01:18:34,744 --> 01:18:36,837
It's not like the old days.

1018
01:18:38,715 --> 01:18:40,910
Fighters were fighters then, Father.

1019
01:18:41,250 --> 01:18:44,083
"KO" Phil Kaplan, Augie Ratner,
Battling Levinsky.

1020
01:18:44,153 --> 01:18:46,951
I remember them
like they were here in front of us.

1021
01:18:47,023 --> 01:18:50,049
I'm telling you,
even the little men were giants then.

1022
01:18:50,126 --> 01:18:54,825
Jack Bernstein, Louis "Kid" Kaplan,
"Ruby" Goldstein, "Corporal Izzy" Schwartz.

1023
01:18:55,098 --> 01:18:58,329
I could go back even further, to Abe Attel...

1024
01:18:59,702 --> 01:19:00,794
Well?

1025
01:19:01,904 --> 01:19:04,429
All right then, "Harlem" Tommy Murphy.

1026
01:19:05,541 --> 01:19:06,667
Thank you.

1027
01:19:12,448 --> 01:19:14,780
Want another cup of coffee, Lew?
I'm packing in for the night.

1028
01:19:14,851 --> 01:19:17,217
This will do for me. Hey, where's Willy?

1029
01:19:17,653 --> 01:19:20,588
That's easy. The same place he's been
the last three nights.

1030
01:19:20,656 --> 01:19:23,454
- What are you talking about?
- Over at Lieberman's.

1031
01:19:23,860 --> 01:19:26,761
Like a big grasshopper,
hidden in the flora and the fauna.

1032
01:19:26,829 --> 01:19:28,456
Get out of here. Willy?

1033
01:19:29,365 --> 01:19:31,299
He's carrying a torch for Dolly.

1034
01:19:31,367 --> 01:19:34,598
Like life ain't worth a chopped chicken
liver sandwich without her.

1035
01:19:34,670 --> 01:19:37,935
Maynard, you mean to tell me he goes
over to Lieberman's, sneaks in to see her?

1036
01:19:38,007 --> 01:19:40,407
Like I say, he merges with the flora
and the fauna, whatever...

1037
01:19:40,476 --> 01:19:43,604
just to get a chance to see her,
to hear her sing a song.

1038
01:19:43,679 --> 01:19:45,044
How do you like that?

1039
01:19:45,114 --> 01:19:48,709
You know, just between the two of us,
Lew, for a bum like Willy...

1040
01:19:49,452 --> 01:19:52,250
I think it's kind of beautiful and sweet.

1041
01:19:53,422 --> 01:19:55,219
How do you like that?

1042
01:20:15,378 --> 01:20:17,471
- Evening.
- Willy ain't here.

1043
01:20:17,613 --> 01:20:20,343
Oh, that's fine.
You're the one I wanted to see.

1044
01:20:21,517 --> 01:20:23,246
You've been around this business
long enough...

1045
01:20:23,319 --> 01:20:25,184
I don't have to draw any pictures, Lew.

1046
01:20:25,254 --> 01:20:28,246
I'm not as smart as you are.
Sometimes I need a picture.

1047
01:20:28,324 --> 01:20:30,121
Not for this, you don't.

1048
01:20:30,226 --> 01:20:32,922
You know as well as I do
this two-for-a-nickel knight in armor...

1049
01:20:32,995 --> 01:20:34,587
can't lick one half of Romero.

1050
01:20:35,398 --> 01:20:37,332
So what're you all doing here, then?

1051
01:20:37,400 --> 01:20:40,801
Accidents happen.
Some people call them miracles.

1052
01:20:42,605 --> 01:20:44,539
Give me a "for instance."

1053
01:20:44,640 --> 01:20:47,700
This kid takes a punch like a barn door,
Marvin tells me.

1054
01:20:48,044 --> 01:20:50,706
He could get lucky
with a wild punch of his own.

1055
01:20:50,780 --> 01:20:52,771
Now, with all the dough that's riding
on this fight...

1056
01:20:52,849 --> 01:20:54,214
that's something I couldn't afford.

1057
01:20:55,685 --> 01:20:59,177
It gets me right here, Otto.
Just can't tell you how bad I feel.

1058
01:21:05,061 --> 01:21:08,155
- So what do you want from me?
- A little insurance, that's all.

1059
01:21:08,231 --> 01:21:11,997
- Something you can handle real nice.
- Get out of here. That's out of my line.

1060
01:21:13,369 --> 01:21:15,303
How long have you been
handling fighters, Lew?

1061
01:21:15,371 --> 01:21:16,963
A long time. Too long.

1062
01:21:17,473 --> 01:21:19,373
Mended a lot of cuts in that time,
haven't you?

1063
01:21:19,442 --> 01:21:20,466
A fair share, yeah.

1064
01:21:20,543 --> 01:21:23,842
Don't be so modest.
You're probably the best in the country.

1065
01:21:24,547 --> 01:21:27,778
I've seen you work in the Garden,
St. Nick's, the Stadium.

1066
01:21:28,050 --> 01:21:30,610
Why, you could patch the eye
of a monkey on a swing.

1067
01:21:30,686 --> 01:21:33,314
- So what about it?
- This about it.

1068
01:21:33,956 --> 01:21:36,015
Galahad's got a jaw like a curbstone,
they tell me...

1069
01:21:36,092 --> 01:21:38,151
but he cuts and bleeds like anybody else.

1070
01:21:38,561 --> 01:21:41,894
After three rounds with Romero,
the referee will have to stop it...

1071
01:21:41,964 --> 01:21:44,865
as long as you're not in his corner
to patch him up.

1072
01:21:45,401 --> 01:21:46,663
That's your insurance, huh?

1073
01:21:48,237 --> 01:21:51,832
Well, let's just say it's part of my business
to see that he bleeds...

1074
01:21:51,908 --> 01:21:53,375
a little bit extra.

1075
01:21:54,844 --> 01:21:58,439
Here's $500 to help you get lost.

1076
01:22:00,049 --> 01:22:04,281
There'll be somebody else in Galahad's
corner, someone who'll know what to do.

1077
01:22:04,887 --> 01:22:07,321
Someone who'll make sure that he bleeds...

1078
01:22:07,390 --> 01:22:10,120
that will open the cuts,
instead of closing them.

1079
01:22:10,893 --> 01:22:12,554
Any bright ideas?

1080
01:22:13,663 --> 01:22:15,722
Yeah, I got a bright idea.

1081
01:22:16,699 --> 01:22:19,600
It's what you can do with this $500.

1082
01:23:09,452 --> 01:23:10,680
Maynard?

1083
01:23:13,089 --> 01:23:14,147
Lew?

1084
01:23:33,109 --> 01:23:36,772
We've been having a quiet,
kind of professional talk in here, Willy.

1085
01:23:39,315 --> 01:23:40,805
What happened, Lew?

1086
01:23:42,885 --> 01:23:44,375
Otto was here.

1087
01:23:45,888 --> 01:23:48,584
So as I wouldn't be any help to Galahad...

1088
01:23:49,792 --> 01:23:51,589
they busted my hands.

1089
01:23:54,096 --> 01:23:55,290
Otto?

1090
01:23:55,364 --> 01:23:58,492
We're an old established firm
that can't afford to take chances.

1091
01:24:03,406 --> 01:24:04,464
Who?

1092
01:24:09,645 --> 01:24:12,307
I was never a shy one, Willy.

1093
01:24:46,582 --> 01:24:48,140
Look out, Willy.

1094
01:25:06,802 --> 01:25:07,791
Thanks.

1095
01:25:16,512 --> 01:25:18,844
- You all right, Willy?
- I'm okay.

1096
01:25:24,086 --> 01:25:25,144
Lew.

1097
01:25:31,727 --> 01:25:33,456
Hey, you didn't hurt your hands, did you?

1098
01:25:36,499 --> 01:25:38,626
No, Lew. I didn't hurt them.

1099
01:25:52,982 --> 01:25:56,281
Otto! $8,700, so far.

1100
01:26:03,626 --> 01:26:06,720
Hey, Garfield. I'm glad I caught up with you,
I missed you at the place.

1101
01:26:06,795 --> 01:26:09,923
Well, It's just as well, isn't it?
Considering the way you're into me now.

1102
01:26:09,999 --> 01:26:11,830
This doesn't have anything to do
with horses.

1103
01:26:11,901 --> 01:26:13,698
- What?
- What I mean is, we can clear that up...

1104
01:26:13,769 --> 01:26:16,897
- when the fight's over, but right now I...
- Yeah, Willy?

1105
01:26:17,139 --> 01:26:21,041
Right now, I want to put a modest bundle
on Galahad, like $1,800.

1106
01:26:21,110 --> 01:26:24,204
- $1,800?
- First sentimental bet I ever made.

1107
01:26:24,280 --> 01:26:25,338
You?

1108
01:26:32,121 --> 01:26:33,850
Hey, wait a minute.

1109
01:26:35,424 --> 01:26:36,413
Oh, man.

1110
01:26:37,059 --> 01:26:40,460
- They hurt much, Lew?
- No more than as if seven snakes bit me.

1111
01:26:40,629 --> 01:26:42,460
Tie it in the back, Maynard.

1112
01:26:43,666 --> 01:26:46,794
- You got 10 minutes, Galahad.
- Where's Willy?

1113
01:26:47,069 --> 01:26:51,130
Willy's gone to bet a arm, a leg
and his social security number on Galahad.

1114
01:26:52,141 --> 01:26:53,506
On Galahad?

1115
01:26:56,645 --> 01:26:59,478
Just to let you know how we feel about it,
kid, he's got Lew's money...

1116
01:26:59,548 --> 01:27:00,981
and mine, and another thing...

1117
01:27:01,050 --> 01:27:03,780
Hey, keep a clamp on that big lip
of yours, huh?

1118
01:27:03,986 --> 01:27:05,977
You mean,
everybody's betting everything on me?

1119
01:27:06,322 --> 01:27:08,882
Look, kid, so we went for a couple of bucks.

1120
01:27:09,158 --> 01:27:11,422
This doesn't mean you have to carry
the world on your back.

1121
01:27:11,627 --> 01:27:13,117
Why, it's a credit to you, kid.

1122
01:27:13,495 --> 01:27:15,588
The Mayor says the whole town's gone
in hock...

1123
01:27:15,664 --> 01:27:18,360
Holy smokes, Maynard,
keep your big mouth shut!

1124
01:27:20,102 --> 01:27:23,367
- Frankly, Mr. Grogan, I almost believed you.
- Suit yourself.

1125
01:27:24,073 --> 01:27:26,701
I'm telling you I never did know
who came into that steam room...

1126
01:27:26,775 --> 01:27:30,302
and worked over Rocky Virgil.
I couldn't have testified if I wanted to.

1127
01:27:30,379 --> 01:27:33,075
But you will testify
to what happened last night?

1128
01:27:33,148 --> 01:27:34,376
After what they did to Lew,

1129
01:27:34,450 --> 01:27:37,442
I'll sing for you like a bluebird
when the big day comes along.

1130
01:27:37,519 --> 01:27:40,317
Right now, if you don't mind, Mr. Gerson...

1131
01:27:40,389 --> 01:27:42,152
I got Sugarboy Romero on my mind.

1132
01:27:43,592 --> 01:27:46,060
Willy, thanks.

1133
01:27:51,267 --> 01:27:53,394
All right, Sugar, knock it off.

1134
01:27:53,469 --> 01:27:56,529
If you get any warmer,
we'll have to step on your fuse.

1135
01:27:58,440 --> 01:28:01,238
This bum is fat.
He's five or six pounds overweight.

1136
01:28:01,310 --> 01:28:02,902
What do you mean, fat?

1137
01:28:03,646 --> 01:28:04,908
Shut up.

1138
01:28:05,547 --> 01:28:08,846
There's too much money involved for
anybody to get careless or overconfident.

1139
01:28:08,917 --> 01:28:11,351
Now Otto's orders to your boy
are simple enough.

1140
01:28:11,420 --> 01:28:13,980
If he can't belt out this Galahad
in the first couple of rounds...

1141
01:28:14,056 --> 01:28:17,753
he's to cut him up. Freddie will take care
of the rest, so the referee will stop it.

1142
01:28:19,094 --> 01:28:21,255
<i>- Comprende?</i>
- Is no contest.

1143
01:28:23,732 --> 01:28:26,758
Freddie, get going over to Galahad's room.
Go on, get going.

1144
01:28:37,646 --> 01:28:39,773
I don't know why I came, do you?

1145
01:28:39,848 --> 01:28:42,578
Because you're in love
and you're going to marry the man.

1146
01:28:42,651 --> 01:28:45,620
After what you told me last night,
I know why I came.

1147
01:28:47,356 --> 01:28:49,824
I don't know what good we can possibly do.

1148
01:28:49,892 --> 01:28:52,224
Well, we can root home a winner.

1149
01:28:55,130 --> 01:28:58,293
Mouthpiece, swabs, cotton,
smelling salts, it's all here.

1150
01:28:59,835 --> 01:29:01,427
- Hi.
- Hello, Lew.

1151
01:29:02,604 --> 01:29:06,131
Otto sent me, Willy.
To take loving care of your boy.

1152
01:29:06,208 --> 01:29:08,369
That's nice, it's real nice, Freddie. Thanks.

1153
01:29:08,444 --> 01:29:11,038
- Galahad, you're on.
- Come on, let's go.

1154
01:29:17,753 --> 01:29:19,948
Freddie, let's check the kit.

1155
01:29:23,759 --> 01:29:26,159
Joe, this guy tried to slug me.

1156
01:29:26,228 --> 01:29:28,560
Oh, yeah? I'll take care of him.

1157
01:30:02,831 --> 01:30:05,925
What's happened to Freddie?
Why isn't he in the ring with them now?

1158
01:30:06,001 --> 01:30:08,799
I don't know.
He was on his way five minutes ago.

1159
01:30:11,707 --> 01:30:13,072
You seen Marvin and Ralphie?

1160
01:30:13,142 --> 01:30:15,770
Are you saying we can't get out of here
on a writ of habeas corpus?

1161
01:30:15,844 --> 01:30:18,938
We know as much about habeas corpus
as you know about habeas corpus...

1162
01:30:19,014 --> 01:30:21,539
you flat-headed, flat-footed slob.

1163
01:30:21,617 --> 01:30:23,448
I realize that, Ralphie.

1164
01:30:23,852 --> 01:30:27,913
After all, you've been locked up
in the can a lot more times than me.

1165
01:30:28,090 --> 01:30:29,921
Yeah, yeah. But what about the phone call?

1166
01:30:29,992 --> 01:30:32,961
<i>... sponsored by the Cream Valley</i>
<i>Chamber of Commerce.</i>

1167
01:30:35,731 --> 01:30:38,894
<i>Introducing, from Tijuana, Mexico...</i>

1168
01:30:39,668 --> 01:30:44,002

<i>Ramon "Sugarboy" Romero.</i>

1169

<i>weighing 178 and a half pounds...</i>

1171
01:30:53,482 --> 01:30:57,748
<i>from Cream Valley New York,</i>
<i>our own Kid Galahad!</i>

1172
01:31:01,657 --> 01:31:05,559
<i>And the referee, Mushy Callahan,</i>
<i>will now give them their instructions.</i>

1173
01:31:06,094 --> 01:31:09,291
You know the rules. Let's have a good
bout. Shake hands now, come out boxing.

1174
01:31:09,364 --> 01:31:12,197
Good luck to both you boys. Let's go.
Come on, shake it up.

1175
01:31:15,571 --> 01:31:17,095
Good luck, kid.

1176
01:31:18,874 --> 01:31:21,308
Well, what can I say?

1177
01:31:35,657 --> 01:31:36,919
Keep your left up.

1178
01:31:44,032 --> 01:31:45,397
Work some of those punches!

1179
01:32:05,621 --> 01:32:07,714
- This kid is human?
- I don't know.

1180
01:32:07,789 --> 01:32:10,587
- Glance!
- Kid, keep your right up, keep your right up.

1181
01:33:06,481 --> 01:33:08,608
Now, Willy, keep pressure on that cut.

1182
01:33:08,684 --> 01:33:10,982
You don't have to take this kind
of a beating.

1183
01:33:11,053 --> 01:33:13,613
Win, lose or draw, they're going to pay you.

1184
01:33:13,922 --> 01:33:16,720
Win, lose or draw,
you can still buy that lousy garage.

1185
01:33:16,792 --> 01:33:18,020
Kid, listen to me.

1186
01:33:18,093 --> 01:33:21,494
He's bound to start throwing left hooks
sooner or later. Now, when he does...

1187
01:33:21,563 --> 01:33:25,499
straighten him out with a left,
and then cross with your right. You hear?

1188
01:33:25,567 --> 01:33:28,195
- All right, seconds out.
- Use that right hand.

1189
01:33:39,381 --> 01:33:42,145
Hey, Ramon! Throw a left hook, you bum!

1190
01:33:56,632 --> 01:33:59,692
Six, seven, eight...

1191
01:33:59,768 --> 01:34:02,566
nine, ten!

1192
01:34:22,290 --> 01:34:23,552
Willy! Willy.

1193
01:34:43,745 --> 01:34:46,543
- Hello, Dolly.
- Hello, yourself.

1194
01:34:51,086 --> 01:34:53,486
I heard what happened last night.

1195
01:34:55,624 --> 01:34:59,583
Well, frankly, you clumsy clown,
I couldn't help feeling proud.

1196
01:35:01,530 --> 01:35:03,725
- Like old times, isn't it?
- No.

1197
01:35:04,633 --> 01:35:07,500
Not like old times.
That's where you're wrong, Willy.

1198
01:35:10,138 --> 01:35:13,869
I'll lay you 3-to-1
that we're married before midnight.

1199
01:35:32,627 --> 01:35:35,960
- How much did you bet, Father?
- What makes you think I bet?

1200
01:35:36,031 --> 01:35:39,023
Oh, Father, I eat a piece of ham
once in a while.

1201
01:35:39,101 --> 01:35:41,001
I make a bet once in a while.
