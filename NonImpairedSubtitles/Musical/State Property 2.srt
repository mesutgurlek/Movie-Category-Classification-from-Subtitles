1
00:00:33,426 --> 00:00:35,394
First of all,
I want to apologize...

2
00:00:35,462 --> 00:00:37,657
for being out of touch so long.

3
00:00:37,730 --> 00:00:41,928
These last few years of my life
been real fucked up...

4
00:00:42,001 --> 00:00:44,970
but you probably
already know that by now.

5
00:00:45,038 --> 00:00:47,563
See me fuckin' with you?

6
00:00:47,640 --> 00:00:49,665
I lost almost everything.

7
00:00:50,944 --> 00:00:52,673
Anyway, I'm sorry I left.

8
00:00:52,745 --> 00:00:56,681
For what it's worth,
I think about you every day.

9
00:00:56,749 --> 00:00:59,775
All I want to do is see you die.

10
00:00:59,853 --> 00:01:02,720
You can understand that, right?

11
00:01:02,789 --> 00:01:05,019
But here's the best part...

12
00:01:05,091 --> 00:01:07,059
so pay attention...

13
00:01:07,127 --> 00:01:09,254
'cause if you're readin' this...

14
00:01:09,329 --> 00:01:12,264
it can only mean one thing...

15
00:01:12,332 --> 00:01:14,027
I'm out.

16
00:01:18,071 --> 00:01:20,596
Those of y'all didn't see
"State Property l"...

17
00:01:20,673 --> 00:01:22,140
let me run it down to you.

18
00:01:22,208 --> 00:01:25,143
I put together
this mean-ass squad in Philly...

19
00:01:25,211 --> 00:01:27,543
took over
the whole fuckin' city.

20
00:01:27,614 --> 00:01:30,879
And I bumped heads
with this fuckin' Dame nigga.

21
00:01:30,950 --> 00:01:33,646
This fuckin' nigga
kidnaps my bitch...

22
00:01:33,720 --> 00:01:36,450
then shoots her girlfriend
in the fuckin' head.

23
00:01:36,523 --> 00:01:39,356
So, you know,
we went the fuck to war.

24
00:01:39,425 --> 00:01:41,325
Man, we shot up everything.

25
00:01:41,394 --> 00:01:44,659
Then I get booked
for attempted fuckin' murder.

26
00:01:44,731 --> 00:01:46,528
So you know what I did...

27
00:01:46,599 --> 00:01:48,726
Yeah, I shot up
the whole fuckin' courtroom.

28
00:01:48,801 --> 00:01:50,564
But I don't know
who this chick is...

29
00:01:50,637 --> 00:01:52,901
shot me in the back
of my fuckin' head.

30
00:01:52,972 --> 00:01:54,234
Nah, I'm bullshittin', man.

31
00:01:54,307 --> 00:01:57,504
This is what really went down.

32
00:01:57,577 --> 00:01:59,477
As y'all can see, they got me.

33
00:01:59,546 --> 00:02:01,309
Man, I'm booked.

34
00:02:01,381 --> 00:02:03,781
So let me tell you
how shit went down.

35
00:02:03,850 --> 00:02:05,750
Man, it was about...

36
00:02:05,818 --> 00:02:08,218
Damn, it was that fuckin' long?

37
00:02:09,455 --> 00:02:11,116
Fuck it. Anyway, listen...

38
00:02:12,725 --> 00:02:15,626
I was asleep
when they came for me.

39
00:02:15,695 --> 00:02:17,390
You know how them boys play.

40
00:02:17,463 --> 00:02:20,660
They come kick in your door,
5:00, 6:00 in the morning...

41
00:02:20,733 --> 00:02:23,395
all crazy.

42
00:02:23,469 --> 00:02:27,200
Me, my wife, my daughter...
we was all knocked out.

43
00:02:27,273 --> 00:02:28,570
Come on! Get down!

44
00:02:28,641 --> 00:02:30,199
Come on! Show me your hands!

45
00:02:30,276 --> 00:02:32,540
Get the fuck
out of that bed! Get up!

46
00:02:32,612 --> 00:02:34,239
Hey! Come on, man!

47
00:02:34,314 --> 00:02:35,281
Show me your hands!

48
00:02:35,348 --> 00:02:36,406
Hey, I'll show 'em!

49
00:02:36,482 --> 00:02:38,848
Hey! Yo, get... Aah!

50
00:02:38,918 --> 00:02:40,385
Get down! Show me your hands!

51
00:02:40,453 --> 00:02:41,920
Get him behind!

52
00:02:41,988 --> 00:02:43,979
You know what? Stop.

53
00:02:44,057 --> 00:02:45,888
See, if I'm gonna tell you
this story...

54
00:02:46,125 --> 00:02:48,992
I might as well tell it to you
from the very beginning...

55
00:02:49,062 --> 00:02:51,223
just so y'all get to know me
a little better.

56
00:02:52,765 --> 00:02:54,528
Punk!

57
00:02:54,601 --> 00:02:58,037
I wasn't your average little
happy schoolboy growing up.

58
00:02:58,104 --> 00:02:59,366
You think you nuts,
takin' my stuff?

59
00:02:59,439 --> 00:03:00,406
Give me my money!

60
00:03:12,452 --> 00:03:14,044
Before I was Beans...

61
00:03:14,120 --> 00:03:16,384
the so-called ringleader
of the ABM...

62
00:03:16,456 --> 00:03:17,923
man, I was just Beans...

63
00:03:17,991 --> 00:03:20,619
your average bad-ass
11-year-old...

64
00:03:20,693 --> 00:03:23,218
runnin' around the streets
of Philly with my homeys.

65
00:03:25,298 --> 00:03:27,459
There was four of us...

66
00:03:27,533 --> 00:03:31,993
P-Nut, Baby Boy, D-Nice...

67
00:03:32,071 --> 00:03:34,972
and me...
all day, every day...

68
00:03:35,041 --> 00:03:37,976
pickin' fights,
pickin' pockets...

69
00:03:38,044 --> 00:03:39,568
used to hop the train...

70
00:03:39,646 --> 00:03:41,614
roll on people
for their lunch money...

71
00:03:41,681 --> 00:03:44,115
stick up corner stores
with cap guns.

72
00:03:44,183 --> 00:03:46,413
Shit, you know,
anything to get in trouble.

73
00:03:46,486 --> 00:03:48,454
Shit, that's how we had fun.

74
00:03:52,425 --> 00:03:54,120
Hey, come here!

75
00:03:54,193 --> 00:03:57,685
Man, for me, an unlocked door
was always an invitation.

76
00:03:57,764 --> 00:03:59,163
When I was a kid...

77
00:03:59,232 --> 00:04:01,928
you know, I never
got into any real shit...

78
00:04:02,001 --> 00:04:03,832
till one day...

79
00:04:14,180 --> 00:04:16,580
Oh, shit. I found some weed.

80
00:04:16,649 --> 00:04:17,911
- Where? Where?
- Take it!

81
00:04:17,984 --> 00:04:18,951
What?

82
00:04:19,018 --> 00:04:20,144
What we gonna do with it?

83
00:04:20,219 --> 00:04:21,811
Fill your pockets, Gs!

84
00:04:21,888 --> 00:04:24,789
Put the bags anywhere!
Come on!

85
00:04:30,563 --> 00:04:32,463
Oh!

86
00:04:32,532 --> 00:04:34,261
Look what we have here...

87
00:04:34,334 --> 00:04:35,801
a bunch of
young punk motherfuckers...

88
00:04:35,868 --> 00:04:37,130
tryin' to steal from me.

89
00:04:37,203 --> 00:04:39,262
Y'all niggas think y'all men?

90
00:04:39,339 --> 00:04:41,864
Y'all niggas think that y'all
can come here and take my weed?

91
00:04:41,941 --> 00:04:44,535
Now, what should I do to you
little greasy ass niggas?

92
00:04:46,546 --> 00:04:48,514
Should I kick your ass?

93
00:04:48,581 --> 00:04:50,947
Or should I make you
get down or lay down?

94
00:04:51,017 --> 00:04:53,383
Come here, little nigga.

95
00:04:55,588 --> 00:04:56,748
Come here.

96
00:04:59,325 --> 00:05:01,657
You know what this is?
You come in here...

97
00:05:01,728 --> 00:05:03,559
and try to take my weed,
little nigga?

98
00:05:03,629 --> 00:05:04,891
I'm gonna make
an example out of y'all.

99
00:05:04,964 --> 00:05:06,625
I think I should kick
your ass...

100
00:05:06,699 --> 00:05:08,360
and then make you
get down or lay down.

101
00:05:08,434 --> 00:05:09,867
See what I'm sayin',
little nigga?

102
00:05:09,936 --> 00:05:11,460
You hear me?

103
00:05:14,874 --> 00:05:17,968
I didn't choose to be
in this game.

104
00:05:18,044 --> 00:05:20,672
The game chose me.

105
00:05:20,747 --> 00:05:23,841
My first body...
Shit, I was turned out.

106
00:05:24,684 --> 00:05:27,551
From that day on,
it was get down or lay down.

107
00:05:27,653 --> 00:05:30,121
So I grew up,
got into the drug game.

108
00:05:30,189 --> 00:05:31,247
Before you knew it...

109
00:05:31,324 --> 00:05:34,088
I was the number one
street nigga in Philly...

110
00:05:34,160 --> 00:05:37,823
but then my team got reckless,
and I got booked.

111
00:05:37,897 --> 00:05:39,592
They ain't
only locked me up...

112
00:05:39,665 --> 00:05:42,099
man, they booked me
the fuck up something crazy...

113
00:05:42,168 --> 00:05:44,363
right in front of my wife
and my daughter.

114
00:05:44,437 --> 00:05:46,029
But you know how the feds play.

115
00:05:46,105 --> 00:05:47,436
They do what the fuck they want.

116
00:05:47,507 --> 00:05:49,941
I'm fuckin' callin' my lawyer!
I swear to God!

117
00:05:50,009 --> 00:05:52,273
They had me
for attempted Murder One...

118
00:05:52,345 --> 00:05:55,314
four counts of traffic,
and plus a parole violation.

119
00:05:55,381 --> 00:05:57,008
I know they couldn't hold me
on the weight...

120
00:05:57,083 --> 00:05:58,710
'cause I never touched shit...

121
00:05:58,785 --> 00:06:01,913
but attempted murder
on parole with two priors...

122
00:06:01,988 --> 00:06:03,979
How they say it?
"Fuhgedaboutit."

123
00:06:04,056 --> 00:06:06,923
I'm on trial for my life.
Shit was real.

124
00:06:06,993 --> 00:06:10,622
My whole future
was on the line...

125
00:06:10,696 --> 00:06:12,129
and it was
all in the hands...

126
00:06:12,198 --> 00:06:15,190
of this one nut-ass nigga...
C-Zer.

127
00:06:16,402 --> 00:06:17,994
C-Zer had this little front.

128
00:06:18,070 --> 00:06:20,061
He ran a chop shop
around the way...

129
00:06:20,139 --> 00:06:22,107
made his money
off of running keys...

130
00:06:22,175 --> 00:06:24,234
for that Dame nigga,
and, as you know...

131
00:06:24,310 --> 00:06:26,540
everything Dame had,
I was takin'.

132
00:06:26,612 --> 00:06:27,806
What's up, C-Zer?

133
00:06:27,880 --> 00:06:30,713
So I made C-Zer an offer.

134
00:06:30,783 --> 00:06:32,216
Remember I asked you, uh...

135
00:06:32,285 --> 00:06:34,378
was you gonna
get down or lay down?

136
00:06:34,454 --> 00:06:35,546
He refused.

137
00:06:35,621 --> 00:06:37,282
I'm not tryin' to get down.

138
00:06:37,356 --> 00:06:38,618
But I insisted.

139
00:06:38,691 --> 00:06:40,386
Well, lay down, C-Zer.

140
00:06:41,461 --> 00:06:43,861
About five times.

141
00:06:46,532 --> 00:06:49,433
Unfortunately for C-Zer,
he lived.

142
00:06:49,502 --> 00:06:51,402
Hard-head motherfucker.

143
00:06:51,471 --> 00:06:53,268
Shit,
but we took care of it, though.

144
00:06:54,474 --> 00:06:55,736
On the night before the trial...

145
00:06:55,808 --> 00:06:58,641
I sent Baby Boy and D-Nice
up to C-Zer's mom's crib.

146
00:06:58,711 --> 00:07:00,576
We ain't got no sympathy
for you, old lady.

147
00:07:00,646 --> 00:07:01,738
You could stop cryin'.

148
00:07:01,814 --> 00:07:03,873
They showed her flicks
of the whole family...

149
00:07:03,950 --> 00:07:05,542
addresses and all...

150
00:07:05,618 --> 00:07:08,587
told her if her son
testified against me...

151
00:07:08,654 --> 00:07:10,747
they was gonna tie her up
and make her...

152
00:07:10,823 --> 00:07:13,849
watch them execute
their whole fuckin' family.

153
00:07:13,926 --> 00:07:15,791
Call him! Get him
on the phone right now!

154
00:07:15,862 --> 00:07:18,660
Shit, I don't know how
Baby Boy got them flicks...

155
00:07:18,731 --> 00:07:21,723
but that old lady was shook.

156
00:07:21,801 --> 00:07:23,860
That's all it took.

157
00:07:25,371 --> 00:07:26,929
Dial it faster!

158
00:07:27,006 --> 00:07:29,031
Can you identify the person...

159
00:07:29,108 --> 00:07:32,043
who shot you five times
at point blank range?

160
00:07:32,111 --> 00:07:34,204
Man, when the state wants you...

161
00:07:34,280 --> 00:07:36,407
they play dirty!

162
00:07:37,750 --> 00:07:40,548
Shit, I was tryin'
to be focused up.

163
00:07:40,620 --> 00:07:43,350
Then they hit me
with this Spanish Fly...

164
00:07:43,422 --> 00:07:47,017
this crazy-ass,
super-sexy-ass D.A.

165
00:07:47,093 --> 00:07:49,994
I mean, this bitch was bad!

166
00:07:50,062 --> 00:07:53,088
I ain't gonna lie.
I was open.

167
00:07:53,165 --> 00:07:55,861
Shit, I was damn near ready
to convict myself.

168
00:07:57,270 --> 00:07:59,329
Do you recognize
that man over there?

169
00:07:59,405 --> 00:08:01,396
No, I'm fuckin with y'all, man.
I was focused.

170
00:08:01,474 --> 00:08:03,305
Fuck that.
My life was on the line.

171
00:08:03,376 --> 00:08:04,775
I'm gonna ask you one more time.

172
00:08:04,844 --> 00:08:07,005
Do you recognize him? Please.

173
00:08:08,447 --> 00:08:10,005
No, ma'am.

174
00:08:10,082 --> 00:08:11,140
What?

175
00:08:13,753 --> 00:08:16,051
Let's have some quiet
in the courtroom now.

176
00:08:16,122 --> 00:08:17,146
Order here!

177
00:08:17,223 --> 00:08:18,520
Your Honor, this man
has perjured himself...

178
00:08:18,591 --> 00:08:19,717
in front of the jury.

179
00:08:19,792 --> 00:08:20,918
Counselor, order!

180
00:08:20,993 --> 00:08:22,358
You cannot allow this!
He's lying!

181
00:08:22,428 --> 00:08:23,656
That's enough, Counselor!
Order!

182
00:08:23,729 --> 00:08:25,026
Do you recognize that man?

183
00:08:25,097 --> 00:08:26,428
That's enough.

184
00:08:38,811 --> 00:08:40,745
Answer me.

185
00:08:40,813 --> 00:08:42,781
Do you recognize this man?

186
00:08:42,848 --> 00:08:45,009
Do you know him?

187
00:08:48,287 --> 00:08:50,346
I've never seen him
before in my life.

188
00:08:52,892 --> 00:08:56,225
Order! Let's have some quiet
in the courtroom now!

189
00:08:58,764 --> 00:09:03,201
Yeah. We got to him early.

190
00:09:03,269 --> 00:09:05,134
Unbelievable.

191
00:09:05,204 --> 00:09:08,071
This is unbelievable.
What are we gonna do?

192
00:09:08,140 --> 00:09:12,133
Man, after two weeks of
bullshit evidence and sidebars,

193
00:09:12,211 --> 00:09:13,644
they finally made
their decision.

194
00:09:13,713 --> 00:09:15,442
Will the defendant please rise?

195
00:09:15,514 --> 00:09:17,243
I was a little nervous.

196
00:09:17,316 --> 00:09:19,045
We went head-up
with the judge...

197
00:09:19,118 --> 00:09:20,642
but then, after C-Zer cracked...

198
00:09:20,720 --> 00:09:22,585
I knew I had this thing on lock.

199
00:09:22,655 --> 00:09:25,920
I hereby sentence you
to not less than 15...

200
00:09:25,992 --> 00:09:28,961
nor more than 30 years at
the state correctional facility.

201
00:09:29,028 --> 00:09:30,188
But you know what?

202
00:09:30,262 --> 00:09:31,752
Man, he still pinned
the weight on me.

203
00:09:31,831 --> 00:09:33,924
And, being a repeat offender...

204
00:09:34,000 --> 00:09:36,764
man, the judge put me
under the jail.

205
00:09:36,836 --> 00:09:38,804
Miss, please.

206
00:09:38,871 --> 00:09:40,634
Perry put in an appeal
for me...

207
00:09:40,706 --> 00:09:42,901
but, man,
that shit ain't look good.

208
00:09:42,975 --> 00:09:46,001
And that was it. Game over.

209
00:09:52,618 --> 00:09:55,314
In jail, you meet all kinds
of motherfuckers.

210
00:09:55,388 --> 00:09:57,322
You can always tell
who done time...

211
00:09:57,390 --> 00:09:59,585
by the look on their face.

212
00:09:59,659 --> 00:10:01,388
Check out the white boy
right here.

213
00:10:01,460 --> 00:10:03,052
He's definitely shook.

214
00:10:03,129 --> 00:10:04,721
He's probably
a college dropout...

215
00:10:04,797 --> 00:10:06,958
booked for credit cards
or something.

216
00:10:07,033 --> 00:10:09,934
Now, this dude right here...
definitely a pedophile.

217
00:10:10,002 --> 00:10:12,527
Rapist-face-lookin'
motherfucker.

218
00:10:12,605 --> 00:10:15,972
Here you got your car thief,
retail theft-ass nigga.

219
00:10:16,042 --> 00:10:18,340
He can't stay out of Walgreen's.

220
00:10:18,411 --> 00:10:20,379
He's probably down
for domestics...

221
00:10:20,446 --> 00:10:22,414
or child support or some shit.

222
00:10:22,481 --> 00:10:24,449
Look at him.

223
00:10:24,517 --> 00:10:27,008
Him... he's too tough already.

224
00:10:27,086 --> 00:10:30,249
You can tell this is
his first time being in jail.

225
00:10:30,322 --> 00:10:31,914
Now, this dude right here...

226
00:10:31,991 --> 00:10:34,050
he definitely
been in jail before.

227
00:10:34,126 --> 00:10:36,822
He look like he's just waiting
for commissary.

228
00:10:36,896 --> 00:10:38,591
See, the thing is...

229
00:10:38,664 --> 00:10:41,030
it don't matter if
you're a cold-blooded killer...

230
00:10:41,100 --> 00:10:45,298
if you're a kingpin,
small-time hustler, car thief.

231
00:10:45,371 --> 00:10:47,271
Once they put
them shackles on you...

232
00:10:47,339 --> 00:10:48,829
and they close that gate...

233
00:10:48,908 --> 00:10:50,432
you ain't nothin' but a number.

234
00:10:50,509 --> 00:10:52,033
Man, you're state property.

235
00:11:05,725 --> 00:11:07,852
- Man, what up? Holler at me.
- Let's go.

236
00:11:10,563 --> 00:11:12,155
This is it.

237
00:11:14,567 --> 00:11:16,467
All right, come on.

238
00:11:37,690 --> 00:11:39,282
I'm Free.

239
00:11:42,862 --> 00:11:44,124
You free?

240
00:11:44,196 --> 00:11:48,428
Nah, that's my name... Free.

241
00:11:49,935 --> 00:11:51,869
Philadelphia Freeway.

242
00:11:51,937 --> 00:11:53,996
How did I get where I'm at?

243
00:11:54,073 --> 00:11:56,871
I was runnin'
with this cat from Miami.

244
00:11:56,942 --> 00:11:59,137
It was lovely...

245
00:11:59,211 --> 00:12:01,805
till someone ratted him out.

246
00:12:01,881 --> 00:12:03,405
Police! Freeze!

247
00:12:03,482 --> 00:12:05,473
We both took the fall.

248
00:12:05,551 --> 00:12:07,610
You! Stop right there!

249
00:12:32,978 --> 00:12:36,675
Yeah, what up, Free? Beans.

250
00:12:36,749 --> 00:12:38,808
Salaam alekum.

251
00:12:38,884 --> 00:12:41,546
Heh. Walekum a salaam.

252
00:12:41,620 --> 00:12:45,056
A lot of niggas find Mohammed
when they get locked down.

253
00:12:45,124 --> 00:12:47,092
They get out,
rock a suit and a bowtie...

254
00:12:47,159 --> 00:12:49,150
sling a couple of bean pies...

255
00:12:49,228 --> 00:12:52,061
spark a "L"
and forget all about that shit.

256
00:12:52,131 --> 00:12:55,294
See, but Free, he was
one of those real Muslims.

257
00:12:55,367 --> 00:12:57,267
Welcome, my kin.

258
00:12:59,004 --> 00:13:01,336
Welcome to what?

259
00:13:01,407 --> 00:13:02,874
This shit hole?

260
00:13:02,942 --> 00:13:04,671
Mashallah.

261
00:13:04,743 --> 00:13:06,176
Say what?

262
00:13:06,245 --> 00:13:09,442
Shit house, mansion...

263
00:13:09,515 --> 00:13:11,312
it's whatever you make it,
a'ight?

264
00:13:13,919 --> 00:13:15,352
Yeah, whatever, man.

265
00:13:15,421 --> 00:13:17,753
Free never talked much,
but when he did...

266
00:13:17,823 --> 00:13:19,984
it was always something deep.

267
00:13:20,059 --> 00:13:23,654
I admit, I kind of liked
this nigga from the jump.

268
00:13:23,729 --> 00:13:26,960
But in jail,
you can't trust nobody...

269
00:13:27,032 --> 00:13:28,499
no matter what.

270
00:13:28,567 --> 00:13:30,194
For example...

271
00:13:30,269 --> 00:13:32,533
there was this one nigga
here for life.

272
00:13:32,605 --> 00:13:35,233
Everybody called him
"The Fist"...

273
00:13:35,307 --> 00:13:38,003
big, black, ugly-ass nigga...

274
00:13:38,077 --> 00:13:39,476
nothin' to lose.

275
00:13:39,545 --> 00:13:42,912
I mean, every day,
this nigga was on some shit.

276
00:13:42,982 --> 00:13:45,473
He ain't give a fuck
if he knew you or not...

277
00:13:45,551 --> 00:13:47,018
but once a day...

278
00:13:47,086 --> 00:13:48,815
this motherfucker
would pick out somebody.

279
00:13:50,890 --> 00:13:53,017
I mean, this nigga in for life.

280
00:13:53,092 --> 00:13:54,582
I guess he had to vent.

281
00:13:54,660 --> 00:13:56,855
Heh. It was kind of funny to me.

282
00:13:56,929 --> 00:13:58,328
Broad Street Bully.

283
00:13:58,397 --> 00:14:00,490
Nut, what's up, nigga?!

284
00:14:00,566 --> 00:14:02,500
- What's goin' on?
- What up?

285
00:14:02,568 --> 00:14:06,265
Inside, you never really know
what's what or who's who.

286
00:14:06,338 --> 00:14:08,829
The only thing you come
to jail with is your rep...

287
00:14:08,908 --> 00:14:11,741
and everybody knew my rep
from the street.

288
00:14:11,810 --> 00:14:15,109
Man, in 24 hours,
I already had me a little crew.

289
00:14:15,180 --> 00:14:17,171
Shit, I was good.

290
00:14:18,984 --> 00:14:21,214
Every night
was the same shit...

291
00:14:21,287 --> 00:14:24,154
and every day
was just more of it.

292
00:14:24,223 --> 00:14:27,454
I mean, the scariest part
of being in jail to me...

293
00:14:27,526 --> 00:14:29,926
was gettin' used to it.

294
00:14:55,721 --> 00:14:58,485
I could tell Free had been down
for a minute...

295
00:14:58,557 --> 00:15:00,491
'cause he's too laid back.

296
00:15:00,559 --> 00:15:03,221
I mean, every time I'd ask him
what'd he do to get in here...

297
00:15:03,295 --> 00:15:05,923
he'd always say the same shit.

298
00:15:05,998 --> 00:15:07,966
Hey, Free...

299
00:15:08,033 --> 00:15:09,660
keep it real with me, homey.

300
00:15:09,735 --> 00:15:11,726
You know
everything about me, man.

301
00:15:11,804 --> 00:15:14,364
What the fuck
you do to get in here, man?

302
00:15:16,942 --> 00:15:19,740
Listen, a'ight,
mistakes don't matter.

303
00:15:19,812 --> 00:15:22,508
It's the consequences
we gotta live by.

304
00:15:23,882 --> 00:15:25,713
Sometimes
I ain't had no idea...

305
00:15:25,784 --> 00:15:27,979
what the fuck
Free was talkin' about...

306
00:15:28,053 --> 00:15:30,351
but I always listened.

307
00:15:32,758 --> 00:15:34,953
Man, there's a lot of ways
you can kill time...

308
00:15:35,027 --> 00:15:36,460
while you're doing time.

309
00:15:36,528 --> 00:15:39,019
You could work out, exercise...

310
00:15:43,068 --> 00:15:46,060
You could practice
the culinary arts.

311
00:15:46,138 --> 00:15:48,299
You know, cookin'
and all that shit.

312
00:15:49,675 --> 00:15:52,542
Some niggas like to fuck
with carpentry.

313
00:15:54,380 --> 00:15:57,543
While they was having fun
doing all that bullshit...

314
00:15:57,616 --> 00:15:59,607
man, I was trying
to learn the law.

315
00:15:59,685 --> 00:16:01,448
Shit, my appeal
was coming up...

316
00:16:01,520 --> 00:16:04,250
and I wasn't trying
to just rely on my lawyers.

317
00:16:04,323 --> 00:16:06,291
So I studied.

318
00:16:10,095 --> 00:16:13,030
Man, that shit only lasted
about five minutes.

319
00:16:13,098 --> 00:16:15,589
It was too technical for me.

320
00:16:17,503 --> 00:16:21,098
Come on, Akeem. Heh.

321
00:16:21,173 --> 00:16:22,902
Come on, man,
let's go hit the shower.

322
00:16:22,975 --> 00:16:24,442
All right, man, come on.

323
00:16:24,510 --> 00:16:26,000
I'm ready.

324
00:16:26,078 --> 00:16:27,636
Mashallah.

325
00:16:27,713 --> 00:16:30,511
Everything
"Allah" with you, man.

326
00:16:30,582 --> 00:16:32,015
Mashallah.

327
00:16:32,084 --> 00:16:34,211
Get Allah to get us
out of here, man.

328
00:16:36,188 --> 00:16:38,213
- You ready?
- Yeah.

329
00:16:56,442 --> 00:16:57,773
God damn!

330
00:16:57,843 --> 00:16:58,969
What's wrong, bro?

331
00:16:59,044 --> 00:17:01,012
Somebody been
in our fuckin' hut, man!

332
00:17:01,080 --> 00:17:02,308
That's crazy.

333
00:17:03,449 --> 00:17:05,542
Hey, C.O.!

334
00:17:06,585 --> 00:17:07,643
C.O.!

335
00:17:07,719 --> 00:17:09,050
What? You got a problem?

336
00:17:09,121 --> 00:17:11,385
Yeah, man. You walk
this fuckin' block all day.

337
00:17:11,457 --> 00:17:13,925
You ain't see nobody
come in our fuckin' hut?

338
00:17:13,992 --> 00:17:15,755
Oh, you gotta be careful
in here.

339
00:17:15,828 --> 00:17:17,227
You got a lot of nice stuff.

340
00:17:17,296 --> 00:17:19,662
Nice pair of tennis shoes.
Worth a lot.

341
00:17:19,731 --> 00:17:21,756
Man, fuck you!

342
00:17:21,834 --> 00:17:23,597
Fuckin' nut!

343
00:17:23,669 --> 00:17:25,967
Man, that shit don't make
no fuckin' sense.

344
00:17:26,038 --> 00:17:28,598
I mean, why would
somebody run in my hut?

345
00:17:28,674 --> 00:17:32,132
They might as well tie the sheet
round their neck theirself.

346
00:17:32,211 --> 00:17:35,544
I mean, you gonna risk your life
over a pair of sneakers?

347
00:17:35,614 --> 00:17:37,912
Nah, man.

348
00:17:37,983 --> 00:17:40,349
And to make matters worse...

349
00:17:40,419 --> 00:17:43,911
the next day, my man D-Nice
came to visit me.

350
00:17:43,989 --> 00:17:47,425
He only show up when
he gotta tell me good news.

351
00:17:47,493 --> 00:17:49,051
What's up, D?

352
00:17:49,128 --> 00:17:51,995
What's up, man. You know
I had to come see my boy, man.

353
00:17:52,197 --> 00:17:54,097
They call me Billy D-Nice...

354
00:17:54,166 --> 00:17:56,726
smooth, smart, and poz.

355
00:17:56,802 --> 00:17:58,702
Always level-headed.

356
00:17:58,770 --> 00:18:01,136
Yeah, long time
no hear from, man.

357
00:18:01,206 --> 00:18:02,673
What's goin' on, man?

358
00:18:02,741 --> 00:18:04,231
Everything's good.

359
00:18:07,846 --> 00:18:09,609
Everything good?

360
00:18:09,681 --> 00:18:11,012
Everything's good.

361
00:18:11,083 --> 00:18:13,142
I hate these fuckin'
visiting rooms...

362
00:18:13,218 --> 00:18:15,778
talkin' on
these nut-ass phones.

363
00:18:15,854 --> 00:18:18,482
They're probably taping us
right now.

364
00:18:18,557 --> 00:18:20,457
Talk to me, though.
What's goin' on, man?

365
00:18:20,526 --> 00:18:22,585
Well, we had a party.

366
00:18:26,098 --> 00:18:27,292
Y'all had a party?

367
00:18:27,366 --> 00:18:30,096
Actually, we've had
four parties the past two weeks.

368
00:18:30,169 --> 00:18:32,296
Y'all had four parties?

369
00:18:32,371 --> 00:18:33,804
Past two weeks.

370
00:18:33,872 --> 00:18:36,033
We had one in West Philly.
Surprise party.

371
00:18:36,108 --> 00:18:38,076
Hold it. Freeze.
Don't fuckin' move.

372
00:18:38,143 --> 00:18:39,303
I didn't do shit, man.

373
00:18:39,378 --> 00:18:41,437
What the fuck
is y'all doin', man?

374
00:18:41,513 --> 00:18:43,481
Come on, man.

375
00:18:46,718 --> 00:18:48,686
You know how I like those,
though, right?

376
00:18:48,754 --> 00:18:50,984
You know,
I like surprise parties, man.

377
00:18:51,056 --> 00:18:53,854
Yeah. Oh, Nada had a party.

378
00:18:54,893 --> 00:18:56,622
Yo, give me that bag.

379
00:18:56,695 --> 00:18:57,719
- Don't move.
- Give me that.

380
00:18:57,796 --> 00:18:59,525
- Good-bye.
- Motherfuckers.

381
00:19:02,968 --> 00:19:04,299
Your man Nada?

382
00:19:04,369 --> 00:19:06,564
My man Nada.

383
00:19:06,638 --> 00:19:09,072
How'd that party turn out?

384
00:19:09,141 --> 00:19:11,632
No bitches there.

385
00:19:11,710 --> 00:19:13,075
All niggas.

386
00:19:13,145 --> 00:19:15,909
- All niggas?
- Dirty niggas, at that.

387
00:19:15,981 --> 00:19:18,916
Y'all found out who fuckin'
promoted that party?

388
00:19:18,984 --> 00:19:20,918
We're still tryin'
to figure that out now.

389
00:19:20,986 --> 00:19:22,351
Yeah, y'all need
to find that out, man.

390
00:19:22,421 --> 00:19:23,911
Get y'all fuckin' money back.

391
00:19:25,257 --> 00:19:28,420
Oh, yeah. Chris and Neef saw
your man Dame on South Street.

392
00:19:28,493 --> 00:19:29,892
Dame?

393
00:19:37,069 --> 00:19:38,866
Fuck Dame, man.

394
00:19:38,937 --> 00:19:41,201
Talk to me
about these parties, man.

395
00:19:41,273 --> 00:19:43,867
Your boys from down
M-l-A came up, man.

396
00:19:43,942 --> 00:19:45,671
They had a crazy party.

397
00:19:45,744 --> 00:19:47,041
Who threw them a party?

398
00:19:47,112 --> 00:19:48,272
Baby Boy.

399
00:19:48,347 --> 00:19:49,314
I'll call you back.

400
00:19:49,381 --> 00:19:50,905
That's him right there, man.

401
00:19:50,983 --> 00:19:53,713
He's makin' that money.
He's takin' those shots, man.

402
00:19:56,088 --> 00:19:58,682
Babito.

403
00:19:58,757 --> 00:20:00,054
Remember me?

404
00:20:00,125 --> 00:20:03,026
Mario, what's the situation,
playboy?

405
00:20:03,095 --> 00:20:04,562
I'm surprised to see
y'all around here.

406
00:20:04,630 --> 00:20:06,325
Ain't it too cool
for you motherfuckers?

407
00:20:06,398 --> 00:20:08,992
You don't call me no more.
You make me come up here...

408
00:20:09,067 --> 00:20:10,694
and talk to you
in person now, huh?

409
00:20:10,769 --> 00:20:12,896
Hey, I ain't been callin' you,
motherfucker.

410
00:20:12,971 --> 00:20:14,768
What am I callin' you for?
I ain't viz.

411
00:20:14,840 --> 00:20:15,898
I'm sick of playing with you.

412
00:20:15,974 --> 00:20:17,271
Where's my motherfuckin' money?

413
00:20:17,342 --> 00:20:18,809
Hey, man, who the fuck
is you talkin' to like that?

414
00:20:18,877 --> 00:20:21,175
Don't come and disrespect me
on my block in front of my boys.

415
00:20:21,246 --> 00:20:23,305
Fuck y'all guala-gualas, man.

416
00:20:23,382 --> 00:20:24,644
What, nigga? What?

417
00:20:24,716 --> 00:20:27,116
Fuck y'all. Fuck y'all niggas.

418
00:20:27,185 --> 00:20:29,949
Yeah. Baby Boy...
the wild card.

419
00:20:30,022 --> 00:20:32,149
I keep the ABM in the game.

420
00:20:32,224 --> 00:20:33,623
We got guns, too, nigga.

421
00:20:33,692 --> 00:20:34,954
Go ahead, nigga. Go ahead.

422
00:20:35,027 --> 00:20:36,961
Shoot, nigga. We got guns, too.

423
00:20:37,029 --> 00:20:38,496
Chill out.

424
00:20:38,563 --> 00:20:39,655
Fuck y'all.

425
00:20:39,731 --> 00:20:41,494
Fuck you, Mario.

426
00:20:41,566 --> 00:20:42,692
Lucky I like him.

427
00:20:42,768 --> 00:20:44,133
I don't give a fuck
who you like, nigga.

428
00:20:44,202 --> 00:20:46,261
- I want my money.
- Well, come take it.

429
00:20:46,338 --> 00:20:48,329
You ain't never
gettin' paid, nigga!

430
00:20:48,407 --> 00:20:50,238
Baby Boy
threw them a party, huh?

431
00:20:50,309 --> 00:20:51,799
A crazy party.

432
00:20:51,877 --> 00:20:53,139
He ate all the chicken, man.

433
00:20:53,211 --> 00:20:54,838
He fucked all the chicken up.

434
00:20:54,913 --> 00:20:57,177
Fucked all the chicken up, huh?

435
00:20:57,249 --> 00:20:58,978
All the chicken.

436
00:20:59,051 --> 00:21:01,645
I guess what they say is true...

437
00:21:01,720 --> 00:21:03,483
shit happen in threes.

438
00:21:03,555 --> 00:21:07,252
'Cause in three months,
our main spot get raided...

439
00:21:09,227 --> 00:21:11,957
one of our top workers
gets robbed...

440
00:21:12,030 --> 00:21:15,363
and what's supposed to be
my fuckin' right-hand man...

441
00:21:15,434 --> 00:21:18,028
is going through some bullshit
with the connect.

442
00:21:22,040 --> 00:21:24,668
You should get his number
and invite him to the party.

443
00:21:24,743 --> 00:21:27,940
They throwin' all kinds
of parties out there, man.

444
00:21:28,013 --> 00:21:30,413
Y'all just livin' it.

445
00:21:30,482 --> 00:21:32,973
I'm in here,
and y'all out there partyin'.

446
00:21:33,051 --> 00:21:35,713
That's what's up, D.

447
00:21:35,787 --> 00:21:37,220
That's what's up, man.

448
00:21:37,289 --> 00:21:40,884
Oh. I need you to do me a favor.

449
00:21:40,959 --> 00:21:43,985
You, Baby Boy...

450
00:21:44,062 --> 00:21:46,326
stop fuckin' partying.

451
00:21:46,398 --> 00:21:48,059
Can you do that?

452
00:21:48,133 --> 00:21:49,691
I can do that.

453
00:21:49,768 --> 00:21:52,032
All right, man.
'Cause, I mean...

454
00:21:52,104 --> 00:21:54,868
I hate to say it, man, but...

455
00:21:54,940 --> 00:21:56,669
I'm proud of y'all, man.

456
00:22:00,212 --> 00:22:01,406
Nah, seriously.

457
00:22:01,480 --> 00:22:04,313
I'm real fuckin' proud
of y'all, man.

458
00:22:05,617 --> 00:22:08,745
Damn! These niggas

459
00:22:08,820 --> 00:22:10,378
and I'm in here.

460
00:22:10,455 --> 00:22:12,548
Man, I can't be
in this bitch stressin'.

461
00:22:13,859 --> 00:22:15,224
Fuckin' partyin'.

462
00:22:15,293 --> 00:22:16,920
I know what the fuck
I'm gonna do, though.

463
00:22:17,429 --> 00:22:20,159
I'm gonna call my girl Aisha
and get some love.

464
00:22:20,232 --> 00:22:22,462
Fuck.
Thugs need love, too, right?

465
00:22:22,534 --> 00:22:24,058
- Hello?
- This is the operator.

466
00:22:24,136 --> 00:22:25,797
You have a collect call
from Beans.

467
00:22:25,871 --> 00:22:27,133
Will you accept the charges?

468
00:22:27,205 --> 00:22:28,672
Yeah, I'll accept the charges.

469
00:22:28,740 --> 00:22:30,765
Hey, baby. It's Beans.

470
00:22:30,842 --> 00:22:31,900
Who?

471
00:22:31,977 --> 00:22:33,842
It's Beans. What's up, Boo?

472
00:22:33,912 --> 00:22:36,642
Beans? Yeah, well,
I don't know any Beans.

473
00:22:36,715 --> 00:22:38,842
Hey, stop fuckin'
playin' with me, man.

474
00:22:38,917 --> 00:22:40,851
Listen here.
I'm not fuckin' playin', OK?

475
00:22:40,919 --> 00:22:42,318
Do I sound like I'm playin'?

476
00:22:42,387 --> 00:22:43,479
I'm not playin' with you.

477
00:22:43,555 --> 00:22:44,783
Aisha, who the fuck
you talkin' to?

478
00:22:44,856 --> 00:22:46,187
Because you said
that you promised...

479
00:22:46,258 --> 00:22:47,885
that you weren't gonna
leave us, that's why.

480
00:22:47,959 --> 00:22:49,620
Whoa, whoa, whoa.
Hold the fuck up.

481
00:22:49,694 --> 00:22:51,286
Aisha, you know
who you talkin' to?

482
00:22:51,363 --> 00:22:53,729
I don't give a fuck,
you fuckin' fat, black bitch.

483
00:22:53,799 --> 00:22:54,959
Let me fuckin' tell you...

484
00:22:55,033 --> 00:22:56,523
What the fuck
is you yellin' for?

485
00:22:56,601 --> 00:22:58,364
What the fuck
I'm supposed to do, huh?

486
00:22:58,437 --> 00:22:59,734
What I'm supposed to do?

487
00:22:59,805 --> 00:23:02,330
What is your wife and daughter
supposed to do now, huh?

488
00:23:02,407 --> 00:23:04,238
Fuckin' tell me that,
you fuckin' inmate!

489
00:23:04,309 --> 00:23:06,675
You convict! What the fuck
I'm supposed to do?

490
00:23:06,745 --> 00:23:08,975
Fuck you, Beans! Whatever!

491
00:23:09,047 --> 00:23:10,378
He-hello?

492
00:23:11,683 --> 00:23:13,014
Hello?

493
00:23:13,084 --> 00:23:14,915
This motherfucker done hung up.

494
00:23:23,895 --> 00:23:26,022
Hey, Nut.
You see this nigga?

495
00:23:26,097 --> 00:23:28,565
That's the nigga
who ran in our fuckin' hut.

496
00:23:28,633 --> 00:23:30,999
- What? Where?
- Don't look, don't look.

497
00:23:31,069 --> 00:23:32,798
This nigga right here, man.

498
00:23:32,871 --> 00:23:34,236
Damn, that is that nigga.

499
00:23:34,306 --> 00:23:36,536
They're your sneaks.
What you gonna do, see?

500
00:23:36,608 --> 00:23:38,940
What the fuck
you think I'm gonna do?

501
00:23:39,010 --> 00:23:40,443
I'm gonna get me a banger...

502
00:23:40,512 --> 00:23:42,707
and I'm gonna poke
this nigga the fuck up.

503
00:23:42,781 --> 00:23:44,840
There you go.
Let me handle that, dawg.

504
00:23:44,916 --> 00:23:46,440
Nah, nah.

505
00:23:46,518 --> 00:23:48,110
I go wash my ass...

506
00:23:48,186 --> 00:23:49,949
and this nigga
run in our hut...

507
00:23:50,021 --> 00:23:52,455
and take my shit?

508
00:23:52,524 --> 00:23:54,685
I got to do
this one myself, man.

509
00:23:56,127 --> 00:23:57,219
Yeah, all right, man.

510
00:23:57,295 --> 00:23:58,785
What's up with Baby Boy?

511
00:24:00,665 --> 00:24:02,724
Man, we need a new connect, man.

512
00:24:02,801 --> 00:24:04,632
Well, get one, then.

513
00:24:04,703 --> 00:24:07,831
You sayin' that like
that shit's so fuckin' simple.

514
00:24:07,906 --> 00:24:09,134
"Go get one, then."

515
00:24:09,207 --> 00:24:10,697
How the fuck
I'm gonna get a connect...

516
00:24:10,775 --> 00:24:12,003
when I'm in here with you?

517
00:24:12,077 --> 00:24:13,339
This man right here.

518
00:24:13,411 --> 00:24:15,936
And he can get you
them bangers.

519
00:24:16,014 --> 00:24:18,505
Who... Damn,
all this time, Free...

520
00:24:18,583 --> 00:24:19,777
and you ain't say nothin'?

521
00:24:19,851 --> 00:24:21,478
You never asked, a'ight?

522
00:24:21,553 --> 00:24:25,649
Listen, my man Loco over
in the Spanish house...

523
00:24:25,724 --> 00:24:27,385
I used to roll with him
back in the day.

524
00:24:27,459 --> 00:24:30,189
He get out in a month.

525
00:24:30,262 --> 00:24:32,253
Set that shit up, then, man.

526
00:24:32,330 --> 00:24:34,457
See, that's what the fuck
I'm talkin' about.

527
00:24:34,533 --> 00:24:37,001
It turns out my celly
was the fuckin' man.

528
00:24:37,068 --> 00:24:40,299
He had a connect,
and he can get me a banger.

529
00:24:40,372 --> 00:24:43,034
All this time,
and he ain't said shit.

530
00:24:43,108 --> 00:24:44,837
I knew I liked
that motherfucker.

531
00:24:44,910 --> 00:24:47,242
Say no more. I got you.

532
00:24:51,249 --> 00:24:54,810
Free's connect
was this guy El Pollo Loco.

533
00:24:54,886 --> 00:24:56,786
He got me what I needed...

534
00:24:56,855 --> 00:24:58,686
and that was that.

535
00:25:36,094 --> 00:25:37,527
Get the fuck up.

536
00:25:38,663 --> 00:25:40,654
You step to me in my cell?

537
00:25:43,835 --> 00:25:45,928
Shut up. Shut the fuck up.

538
00:25:47,272 --> 00:25:48,739
Shut up, shut up.

539
00:25:50,675 --> 00:25:52,370
Motherfucker.

540
00:26:12,030 --> 00:26:14,863
The next morning,
they snatched me and Loco up...

541
00:26:14,933 --> 00:26:17,697
sat us down
in front of the warden...

542
00:26:17,769 --> 00:26:21,500
chump arrogant-ass
motherfucker.

543
00:26:21,573 --> 00:26:23,040
Yo. Police comin', yo.

544
00:26:23,108 --> 00:26:25,042
Find out if that nigga
snitched on me, ya hear me?

545
00:26:25,110 --> 00:26:27,908
They said
he was dirtier than shit.

546
00:26:27,979 --> 00:26:29,879
They all dirty to me.

547
00:26:29,948 --> 00:26:32,508
He tried to make me
and Loco snitch.

548
00:26:32,584 --> 00:26:35,246
Shit, I'd rather die
than be labeled a rat.

549
00:26:35,320 --> 00:26:38,084
El Pollo Loco.

550
00:26:38,156 --> 00:26:40,886
Now, that's a great nickname.

551
00:26:40,959 --> 00:26:43,018
"Crazy chicken," right?

552
00:26:45,330 --> 00:26:47,389
You know what's funny?

553
00:26:47,465 --> 00:26:50,457
My 2-year-old has a nickname.

554
00:26:50,535 --> 00:26:53,504
We call her
Blueberry Muffin Stinky Butt.

555
00:26:53,571 --> 00:26:55,562
You got that goin' for you.

556
00:26:56,908 --> 00:26:59,308
When's your parole here?
On the 17th?

557
00:26:59,377 --> 00:27:01,311
What's that, a month?

558
00:27:01,379 --> 00:27:03,210
Less than a month.

559
00:27:04,849 --> 00:27:06,476
You have one month left.

560
00:27:06,551 --> 00:27:08,849
You're handing out ice picks?

561
00:27:10,488 --> 00:27:12,718
You know that he died, right?

562
00:27:12,791 --> 00:27:15,919
Yeah. You're an accomplice.

563
00:27:17,162 --> 00:27:19,858
Murder One.

564
00:27:21,232 --> 00:27:23,291
The whole thing's on tape.

565
00:27:23,368 --> 00:27:27,134
We showed that tape to
your friend Beans this morning.

566
00:27:27,205 --> 00:27:29,070
Took him about ten seconds...

567
00:27:29,140 --> 00:27:31,608
and he was singing your name.

568
00:27:31,676 --> 00:27:33,405
"Loco!"

569
00:27:34,746 --> 00:27:36,304
It's disgusting.

570
00:27:36,381 --> 00:27:38,406
But what are you gonna do?

571
00:27:38,483 --> 00:27:42,385
Ask me... I say fuck him.

572
00:27:42,454 --> 00:27:44,547
He ratted you out.

573
00:27:44,622 --> 00:27:46,556
He's already in the box.

574
00:27:46,624 --> 00:27:49,718
You want to do
three more years for this guy?

575
00:27:49,794 --> 00:27:51,352
Get out there.

576
00:27:51,429 --> 00:27:54,193
Go make some money,
do something, huh?

577
00:27:55,433 --> 00:27:57,867
Have you ever been in the hole?

578
00:27:57,936 --> 00:28:00,666
It's unbearable.

579
00:28:00,739 --> 00:28:02,866
I tried it for
an hour and a half once...

580
00:28:02,941 --> 00:28:04,465
see what it felt like.

581
00:28:04,542 --> 00:28:08,376
Thought I was
literally going to die.

582
00:28:08,446 --> 00:28:11,040
And you're looking at, what...

583
00:28:11,116 --> 00:28:15,712
730 days, Mister...

584
00:28:16,888 --> 00:28:18,947
Beans?
What kind of name is that?

585
00:28:19,023 --> 00:28:22,015
You're a fuckin' grown man.

586
00:28:22,093 --> 00:28:24,755
Do me a favor.

587
00:28:24,829 --> 00:28:27,297
How much did he charge you
for the shiv?

588
00:28:27,365 --> 00:28:29,595
I hope it was cheap...

589
00:28:29,667 --> 00:28:31,931
'cause that
half-Puerto Rican rat fuck...

590
00:28:32,003 --> 00:28:34,494
sold you up the river like...

591
00:28:36,941 --> 00:28:38,932
OK.

592
00:28:39,010 --> 00:28:41,478
Don't want to talk.
I hear you. Good for you.

593
00:28:41,546 --> 00:28:43,844
You know we have it on tape,
though, right?

594
00:28:43,915 --> 00:28:47,248
You know that?
But you don't want my help.

595
00:28:47,318 --> 00:28:51,118
You don't need my help
'cause you're a gangsta!

596
00:28:51,189 --> 00:28:54,386
Fantastic.
Hey, it's gonna be a pleasure...

597
00:28:54,459 --> 00:28:56,950
to watch you grow old,
tough guy.

598
00:28:57,028 --> 00:28:59,019
Yeah. Yeah.

599
00:28:59,097 --> 00:29:01,463
Your daughter's not gonna get
to see her father...

600
00:29:01,533 --> 00:29:03,763
because you're state property.

601
00:29:05,703 --> 00:29:08,001
Nice.

602
00:29:08,072 --> 00:29:11,007
You think
you're a killer, Beans?

603
00:29:11,075 --> 00:29:12,736
You want to kill something?

604
00:29:16,080 --> 00:29:17,741
Kill time.

605
00:29:20,852 --> 00:29:23,616
Now, get the fuck
out of my office.

606
00:29:23,688 --> 00:29:25,451
They ain't have me on tape.

607
00:29:25,523 --> 00:29:27,047
They ain't had shit.

608
00:29:27,125 --> 00:29:29,286
They gave me and Loco
about an hour in the box.

609
00:29:29,360 --> 00:29:30,520
Lucky day.

610
00:29:30,595 --> 00:29:32,324
I mean,
I don't even know this dude...

611
00:29:32,397 --> 00:29:34,490
but he kept his mouth closed.

612
00:29:34,566 --> 00:29:36,932
You gotta respect that.

613
00:29:43,341 --> 00:29:44,740
Hey, what's happening?

614
00:29:44,809 --> 00:29:46,743
But I had
a lot of questions for him...

615
00:29:46,811 --> 00:29:49,678
and I knew he must have had
a lot of questions for me...

616
00:29:49,747 --> 00:29:53,274
so I told Free
to set it up ASAP.

617
00:29:53,351 --> 00:29:56,650
It was time for me to meet
this guala face-to-face.

618
00:29:56,721 --> 00:29:58,780
I'm goin', all right?

619
00:29:58,857 --> 00:30:00,256
Fuck the police.

620
00:30:00,325 --> 00:30:01,952
You know how we do.
We're gonna get this shit.

621
00:30:02,026 --> 00:30:03,516
For sho', man.

622
00:30:05,129 --> 00:30:08,030
El Pollo Loco...
international hustler...

623
00:30:08,099 --> 00:30:11,193
ambassador of coke.
I'm a fuckin' legend.

624
00:30:11,269 --> 00:30:12,668
What's up, fam?

625
00:30:12,737 --> 00:30:15,729
Yo, good lookin' out on
that thing we did earlier, man.

626
00:30:15,807 --> 00:30:17,069
Yeah, positive.

627
00:30:17,141 --> 00:30:19,302
I appreciate you keepin'
your mouth closed, too, Bear.

628
00:30:19,377 --> 00:30:21,368
Yeah. Beans.

629
00:30:21,446 --> 00:30:23,641
Loco. Bear...

630
00:30:23,715 --> 00:30:26,047
If he was gonna be
the new ABM connect...

631
00:30:26,117 --> 00:30:28,381
I had to know everything
about him.

632
00:30:28,453 --> 00:30:30,751
I grew up in Miami.

633
00:30:30,822 --> 00:30:33,689
Spoiled as shit.
I had everything.

634
00:30:40,098 --> 00:30:42,157
Pops was
a half a thug from Philly...

635
00:30:42,233 --> 00:30:43,700
pretty motherfucker.

636
00:30:43,768 --> 00:30:46,498
Ma Dukes straight out of
Fajardo, Puerto Rico.

637
00:30:46,571 --> 00:30:49,734
Came to Miami in '75
with a killer smile...

638
00:30:49,807 --> 00:30:51,365
and serious game.

639
00:30:51,442 --> 00:30:53,069
She was business
in high heels...

640
00:30:53,144 --> 00:30:55,044
and he was grimy on the trigger.

641
00:30:58,816 --> 00:31:00,215
The truth is...

642
00:31:00,285 --> 00:31:02,685
even though Pops liked to think
he was Scarface...

643
00:31:02,754 --> 00:31:04,187
when it came down to it...

644
00:31:04,255 --> 00:31:05,813
Yo, you got that yeyo?

645
00:31:05,890 --> 00:31:07,619
You got the money?

646
00:31:07,692 --> 00:31:09,523
You got the fuckin' yeyo?

647
00:31:09,594 --> 00:31:11,425
You got the fuckin' money?

648
00:31:12,997 --> 00:31:14,726
When it came down to it...

649
00:31:14,799 --> 00:31:16,528
Mama Love
was the real gangsta.

650
00:31:16,601 --> 00:31:17,795
What the fuck?

651
00:31:19,771 --> 00:31:22,501
Ooh, ooh, Papi,
you talk too much.

652
00:31:22,573 --> 00:31:24,905
Get the yeyo,
let's get the fuck out of here.

653
00:31:24,976 --> 00:31:27,501
The first lady kingpin
in the history of SoBe...

654
00:31:27,578 --> 00:31:29,045
South Beach, Florida.

655
00:31:29,113 --> 00:31:31,343
They got married and got on
some Bonnie and Clyde shit...

656
00:31:31,416 --> 00:31:32,883
for at least six years.

657
00:31:32,951 --> 00:31:34,418
At least, that's what I heard.

658
00:31:34,485 --> 00:31:35,884
I barely knew either one.

659
00:31:37,188 --> 00:31:38,678
I was alone all the time.

660
00:31:38,756 --> 00:31:41,247
Developed
a slight disciplinary problem.

661
00:31:41,326 --> 00:31:43,385
Fuck A.D.D.

662
00:31:43,461 --> 00:31:46,225
I had A.D.D.D.D.D.D.D.

663
00:31:47,966 --> 00:31:50,491
My pops' right hand
was this cat named Biggis.

664
00:31:50,568 --> 00:31:52,536
They grew up in Philly together.

665
00:31:52,603 --> 00:31:55,071
He's basically known for
knockin' niggas the fuck out.

666
00:31:55,139 --> 00:31:57,801
He fought professional
for a hot minute...

667
00:31:57,875 --> 00:31:59,172
got a couple of belts.

668
00:31:59,243 --> 00:32:01,711
Biggis hated everybody...

669
00:32:01,779 --> 00:32:03,679
except me and my family.

670
00:32:03,748 --> 00:32:05,340
What are you doing, Loco?

671
00:32:05,416 --> 00:32:07,680
He kept me safe
my whole life, though.

672
00:32:07,752 --> 00:32:09,413
You want to tear shit up, huh?

673
00:32:09,487 --> 00:32:11,580
Huh? You gonna step?
Put your hands up. Come on.

674
00:32:11,656 --> 00:32:13,021
Can't step up?
Come on. Come on.

675
00:32:13,091 --> 00:32:14,991
You need to put your hands
like this.

676
00:32:15,059 --> 00:32:16,822
Come on! Come on!

677
00:32:19,063 --> 00:32:20,257
OK, you win.

678
00:32:20,331 --> 00:32:22,595
There was so much yeyo
in South Beach...

679
00:32:22,667 --> 00:32:24,430
you have no idea!

680
00:32:24,502 --> 00:32:26,333
It was everywhere.

681
00:32:26,404 --> 00:32:28,497
My parents were
so wrapped up in the game...

682
00:32:28,573 --> 00:32:30,473
no matter how much
I fucked up...

683
00:32:30,541 --> 00:32:33,032
I never even got a beating.

684
00:32:34,379 --> 00:32:37,644
Then, one morning,
everything changed.

685
00:32:39,117 --> 00:32:41,415
Biggis never put me on
to the whole story.

686
00:32:41,486 --> 00:32:42,919
He said it didn't matter.

687
00:32:42,987 --> 00:32:45,785
They were both gone
and never gonna come back.

688
00:32:45,857 --> 00:32:47,347
You OK, man? Come here.

689
00:32:49,394 --> 00:32:53,490
Over the next 16 years,
Biggis was always there.

690
00:32:53,564 --> 00:32:54,531
Biggis! What the fuck?

691
00:32:54,599 --> 00:32:55,793
Happy birthday, kid.

692
00:32:55,867 --> 00:32:57,494
My man... a pea shooter?

693
00:32:57,568 --> 00:32:59,229
Biggis damn near raised me...

694
00:32:59,303 --> 00:33:01,669
kept me out of trouble,
showed me how to hustle...

695
00:33:01,739 --> 00:33:03,400
put money in my pocket...

696
00:33:03,474 --> 00:33:05,408
and the occasional
semi-automatic weapon...

697
00:33:05,476 --> 00:33:07,376
in my hittin' hand.

698
00:33:07,445 --> 00:33:09,310
Man, I have fuckin' rims
that cost more than that.

699
00:33:09,380 --> 00:33:12,713
Bottom line...
Biggis was my only family...

700
00:33:12,784 --> 00:33:14,411
and I loved him.

701
00:33:15,787 --> 00:33:17,948
Now, around my 18th birthday...

702
00:33:18,022 --> 00:33:20,217
Biggis put me on
to this new dude...

703
00:33:20,291 --> 00:33:22,418
El Plaga... The Plague.

704
00:33:22,493 --> 00:33:24,586
He was off the yelzabar...

705
00:33:24,662 --> 00:33:26,254
and if he wanted something...

706
00:33:26,330 --> 00:33:28,560
he was just gonna take the shit.

707
00:33:32,804 --> 00:33:34,897
I was the spokesperson...

708
00:33:34,972 --> 00:33:37,907
public relations nigga.
You figga deal me?

709
00:33:37,975 --> 00:33:39,943
Whoever El Plaga
wanted to meet...

710
00:33:40,011 --> 00:33:41,603
he'll tell Biggis...

711
00:33:41,679 --> 00:33:43,408
and Biggis will send me out...

712
00:33:43,481 --> 00:33:45,210
and I never even met the nigga.

713
00:33:45,283 --> 00:33:47,478
But 'cause
I was fuckin' with him...

714
00:33:47,552 --> 00:33:49,713
wherever I go in the 3-0-5...

715
00:33:49,787 --> 00:33:51,778
my name would ring bells.

716
00:33:51,856 --> 00:33:54,416
Miami was
my personal playground.

717
00:33:54,492 --> 00:33:58,258
Business was so good that
a mid-level nigga like me...

718
00:33:58,329 --> 00:34:00,263
was makin' kingpin paper.

719
00:34:00,331 --> 00:34:02,094
I was runnin' around
clippin' birds...

720
00:34:02,166 --> 00:34:03,394
feedin' pigeons...

721
00:34:03,468 --> 00:34:06,494
like El Pollo Loco! What!

722
00:34:06,571 --> 00:34:08,539
That was my downfall...

723
00:34:08,606 --> 00:34:10,164
my only weakness...

724
00:34:10,241 --> 00:34:12,402
the one thing Biggis,
El Plaga...

725
00:34:12,477 --> 00:34:14,468
no one could save me from...

726
00:34:14,545 --> 00:34:16,035
bitches.

727
00:34:18,483 --> 00:34:20,781
I had a stable of dimes...

728
00:34:20,852 --> 00:34:23,082
one for every day of the week.

729
00:34:33,965 --> 00:34:35,626
You don't love me, nigga.

730
00:34:35,700 --> 00:34:37,565
If you loved me,
you wouldn't call me Tuesday.

731
00:34:37,635 --> 00:34:39,193
If you loved me,
you would call me Missy.

732
00:34:39,270 --> 00:34:41,261
That's my fuckin' name,
and you call me Tuesday.

733
00:34:41,339 --> 00:34:43,398
You call my house
and you ask for Tuesday.

734
00:34:43,474 --> 00:34:45,066
You see,
the trouble started...

735
00:34:45,143 --> 00:34:47,304
when my Tuesday bitch
wanted the Friday slot.

736
00:34:47,378 --> 00:34:48,970
And I gave it to her!

737
00:34:49,046 --> 00:34:50,809
I moved Friday to Saturday...

738
00:34:50,882 --> 00:34:53,476
then Saturday started beefin'.

739
00:34:53,551 --> 00:34:54,779
The point is...

740
00:34:54,852 --> 00:34:57,650
no one can fuck you
like someone you're fuckin'.

741
00:34:58,990 --> 00:35:02,517
I was enjoying my Friday night
when it happened.

742
00:35:05,730 --> 00:35:06,992
Yo.

743
00:35:07,064 --> 00:35:09,464
Hey, Boo, it's Missy.

744
00:35:09,534 --> 00:35:11,525
Who?

745
00:35:11,602 --> 00:35:13,365
Tuesday!

746
00:35:13,437 --> 00:35:15,371
Tuesday?
What the fuck is up?

747
00:35:15,439 --> 00:35:16,929
It's not your day of the week.

748
00:35:17,008 --> 00:35:19,704
I'm just callin' to tell you
I'm not gonna make it next week.

749
00:35:19,777 --> 00:35:21,210
But don't worry...

750
00:35:21,279 --> 00:35:23,304
'cause you're gonna be
locked up by then anyway.

751
00:35:23,381 --> 00:35:25,713
Enjoy prison,
you stupid motherfucker!

752
00:35:29,320 --> 00:35:31,254
And that's all I needed to hear.

753
00:35:34,892 --> 00:35:37,520
I got the money,
cleaned the crib...

754
00:35:37,595 --> 00:35:39,460
and got the fuck
up out of there.

755
00:35:39,530 --> 00:35:42,055
The bitch set me up.
But that's all right, though.

756
00:35:42,133 --> 00:35:43,862
The crib was clean.

757
00:35:43,935 --> 00:35:45,596
Before the cops knew
what hit 'em...

758
00:35:45,670 --> 00:35:48,070
I was on my way
to Philadelph-i-a.

759
00:35:48,139 --> 00:35:49,970
You figga deal me?

760
00:35:50,041 --> 00:35:52,407
Spent some time in Queens.

761
00:35:52,476 --> 00:35:54,569
But Philly was in my blood.

762
00:35:54,645 --> 00:35:56,442
El Plaga wanted me
to go out there...

763
00:35:56,514 --> 00:36:00,746
check out this new boss,
wanted some heavy work. Heavy.

764
00:36:00,818 --> 00:36:02,718
Fast, slick-talkin' type
of nigga.

765
00:36:02,787 --> 00:36:04,721
You ever heard of
the Dame, nigga?

766
00:36:15,032 --> 00:36:16,795
Yeah, I know that nigga.

767
00:36:16,867 --> 00:36:19,893
Well, El Plaga wanted me to
go out there and check him.

768
00:36:19,971 --> 00:36:21,461
As a matter of fact,
he wanted me...

769
00:36:21,539 --> 00:36:23,700
to go out there and check
every-motherfuckin'-body...

770
00:36:23,774 --> 00:36:26,174
plant some seeds,
get some trees there...

771
00:36:26,244 --> 00:36:27,541
branches, leaves...

772
00:36:27,612 --> 00:36:30,012
take over the whole grass plant.
You figga deal me?

773
00:36:30,548 --> 00:36:32,880
El Plaga was right about
Philly's untapped potential.

774
00:36:32,950 --> 00:36:34,281
Dame nigga was the only nigga...

775
00:36:34,352 --> 00:36:36,286
who really put on
some real scrilla.

776
00:36:36,354 --> 00:36:38,117
I understand all that.

777
00:36:38,189 --> 00:36:41,215
But why the fuck
they call that nigga El Plaga?

778
00:36:41,292 --> 00:36:43,556
'Cause he gets
into the system...

779
00:36:43,628 --> 00:36:46,461
shut that motherfucker down
like it's a virus.

780
00:36:46,530 --> 00:36:48,293
You figga deal me?

781
00:36:52,503 --> 00:36:54,232
You want some Jell-O?

782
00:36:54,305 --> 00:36:55,772
Nah.

783
00:36:57,041 --> 00:36:58,531
El Plaga hooked me up
with this botanica...

784
00:36:58,609 --> 00:37:00,474
know what I mean,
on the South Side.

785
00:37:00,544 --> 00:37:02,774
I got the homeboy Freeway
to run the spot.

786
00:37:02,847 --> 00:37:04,906
It was like we was legit.

787
00:37:04,982 --> 00:37:06,279
Cops were paid...

788
00:37:06,350 --> 00:37:09,615
and for at least three months,
nobody fucked with us.

789
00:37:09,687 --> 00:37:11,621
I was about to go back
down to Miami.

790
00:37:11,689 --> 00:37:13,850
I got some info
on who killed my parents.

791
00:37:13,924 --> 00:37:16,722
But before I could even
pack my bags...

792
00:37:16,794 --> 00:37:18,455
fuckin' raid,
by some other cops.

793
00:37:18,529 --> 00:37:19,496
What you runnin' for?

794
00:37:19,563 --> 00:37:21,224
Freeze! Show me your hands!

795
00:37:21,299 --> 00:37:22,561
Is there a problem, officer?

796
00:37:22,633 --> 00:37:24,123
I was definitely set up.

797
00:37:24,201 --> 00:37:25,634
Who you with,
the trench coat mafia?

798
00:37:25,703 --> 00:37:29,161
They busted in with
the K-9 unit looking for it.

799
00:37:29,240 --> 00:37:31,572
I had the coke baked
into these Virgin Mary statues.

800
00:37:31,642 --> 00:37:34,270
They were supposed
to be untraceable.

801
00:37:34,345 --> 00:37:37,143
But Rover had a strong nose.
Figga deal me?

802
00:37:37,214 --> 00:37:38,408
We got something here.

803
00:37:38,482 --> 00:37:40,916
He got a taste
of El Plaga's finest!

804
00:37:40,985 --> 00:37:42,077
What's this?

805
00:37:44,388 --> 00:37:45,787
It's money.

806
00:37:47,325 --> 00:37:48,292
Bingo.

807
00:37:48,359 --> 00:37:50,418
Bingo.

808
00:37:50,494 --> 00:37:52,621
That dog must have felt
like king of the world...

809
00:37:52,697 --> 00:37:54,858
for about five seconds.

810
00:37:54,932 --> 00:37:56,422
Jesus.

811
00:37:56,500 --> 00:37:59,333
There's a lot of money
in these religious statues.

812
00:37:59,403 --> 00:38:01,098
I think
I'm in the wrong business.

813
00:38:01,172 --> 00:38:02,833
You should get a colonic.

814
00:38:02,907 --> 00:38:04,772
Colonic.
I'll give you a fuckin' colonic.

815
00:38:06,177 --> 00:38:07,735
Read these scumbags
their rights...

816
00:38:07,812 --> 00:38:09,507
and get these pieces of shit
out of here.

817
00:38:09,580 --> 00:38:11,377
All right, I want everything
bagged and tagged in here.

818
00:38:11,449 --> 00:38:13,713
By the numbers!
Everything is dirty!

819
00:38:13,784 --> 00:38:15,342
Bag and tag everything!

820
00:38:17,321 --> 00:38:19,516
I lost 900 fuckin' grand.

821
00:38:35,873 --> 00:38:37,966
El Plaga was pissed.

822
00:38:38,042 --> 00:38:40,272
Philly was scared to touch him.

823
00:38:40,344 --> 00:38:42,539
Free got an 8 to 10
on some prior shit...

824
00:38:42,613 --> 00:38:45,605
and I lucked out
with a 3 to 6.

825
00:38:45,683 --> 00:38:48,208
You ain't never find out
who ratted?

826
00:38:48,285 --> 00:38:53,416
Nah, but when I do,
the whole familia lays down.

827
00:38:54,759 --> 00:38:56,556
We got to get in line.

828
00:38:56,627 --> 00:38:59,255
Fucking rat ass niggas, man.

829
00:38:59,330 --> 00:39:01,594
You know, the only thing worse
than a fuckin' rat...

830
00:39:01,665 --> 00:39:02,996
is a faggot.

831
00:39:04,869 --> 00:39:07,360
Shit, at least
you got a hearing coming up.

832
00:39:07,438 --> 00:39:10,703
I can't do shit
out this motherfucker.

833
00:39:10,775 --> 00:39:13,471
I kind of think we could do
something to work that out.

834
00:39:13,544 --> 00:39:14,670
Yeah?

835
00:39:14,745 --> 00:39:16,144
I told you,
El Plaga ain't no joke.

836
00:39:16,213 --> 00:39:17,680
Once he find out
I hit you with the brick...

837
00:39:17,748 --> 00:39:19,045
and then you ain't snitched...

838
00:39:19,116 --> 00:39:22,711
it could be good news
for the both of us.

839
00:39:22,787 --> 00:39:25,779
So, what's up
with this El Plaga nigga?

840
00:39:25,856 --> 00:39:27,949
What he got,
like, the D.A. Or something?

841
00:39:28,025 --> 00:39:29,458
Don't worry about it.

842
00:39:29,527 --> 00:39:32,758
Get your crew to help us out,
and he'll definitely look out...

843
00:39:32,830 --> 00:39:35,924
put us both back in the game.

844
00:39:36,000 --> 00:39:39,094
That's what's up, man.
Whatever you need, fam.

845
00:39:39,170 --> 00:39:40,762
Just livin'.

846
00:39:40,838 --> 00:39:42,430
Poverty.

847
00:39:42,506 --> 00:39:44,337
I was forced
to do the wrong move...

848
00:39:44,408 --> 00:39:46,467
but I've learned my lesson...

849
00:39:46,544 --> 00:39:49,445
during the time
I've been in here.

850
00:39:49,513 --> 00:39:52,880
You know, I got a craft.

851
00:39:52,950 --> 00:39:57,683
You Spanish,
so you figga deal me, right?

852
00:39:57,755 --> 00:39:59,052
Boricua?

853
00:39:59,123 --> 00:40:00,750
Parole boards are hilarious.

854
00:40:00,825 --> 00:40:03,259
Little incident with Beans
actually helped me out.

855
00:40:03,327 --> 00:40:05,022
Worked up
a couple of fake tears...

856
00:40:05,095 --> 00:40:07,290
told them about
missing my 4-year-old son.

857
00:40:07,364 --> 00:40:09,423
Twelve days later, I was out.

858
00:40:09,500 --> 00:40:10,967
I'll start all over.

859
00:40:12,102 --> 00:40:14,070
And I don't even have
a fucking son.

860
00:40:14,138 --> 00:40:16,936
And my kids.

861
00:40:17,007 --> 00:40:19,908
Beans plugged me in
with the ABM set.

862
00:40:19,977 --> 00:40:22,172
I told them that
before we made the deal...

863
00:40:22,246 --> 00:40:25,977
I would have to give his peoples
a little test run.

864
00:40:26,050 --> 00:40:27,142
Make sure they could handle...

865
00:40:27,218 --> 00:40:30,119
all these bricks
I was about to bless them with.

866
00:40:31,655 --> 00:40:32,747
So I got out the crib.

867
00:40:32,823 --> 00:40:34,381
Biggis was there as usual.

868
00:40:34,458 --> 00:40:36,050
He told me El Plaga
was going to give us...

869
00:40:36,126 --> 00:40:38,356
80% of the whole Philly
connection...

870
00:40:38,429 --> 00:40:41,489
and then pull some strings
to try to get Beans out.

871
00:40:41,565 --> 00:40:43,658
He wanted to thank me
for never snitching on him.

872
00:40:43,734 --> 00:40:47,636
How can I snitch on
a motherfucker I never even met?

873
00:40:47,705 --> 00:40:51,106
Anyway, point is,
after all this time...

874
00:40:51,175 --> 00:40:53,939
me and Biggis were back
like we left somethin'.

875
00:40:57,681 --> 00:40:59,478
Meanwhile, back in my world...

876
00:40:59,550 --> 00:41:02,178
Baby Boy and D-Nice
was running the show.

877
00:41:02,253 --> 00:41:03,345
Fuck that.

878
00:41:03,420 --> 00:41:05,012
The tension
was getting too high.

879
00:41:05,089 --> 00:41:07,580
Loco was the perfect cure.

880
00:41:07,658 --> 00:41:10,183
I told Loco
how to deal with Baby Boy...

881
00:41:10,261 --> 00:41:12,695
'cause, you know,
he a little loco hisself.

882
00:41:12,763 --> 00:41:15,789
And I told Baby Boy
if this nigga was for real...

883
00:41:15,866 --> 00:41:18,858
and y'all won't fuck this up,
he might can get me...

884
00:41:18,936 --> 00:41:20,870
back in the streets
in a couple months.

885
00:41:20,938 --> 00:41:24,135
Now, remember the garage
with all the weed?

886
00:41:24,208 --> 00:41:26,176
You know,
where I got my first body at?

887
00:41:26,243 --> 00:41:29,007
Crazy-ass Baby Boy
bought the spot...

888
00:41:29,079 --> 00:41:31,070
and made it
the new ABM hangout.

889
00:41:31,148 --> 00:41:32,706
Hey, yo...

890
00:41:32,783 --> 00:41:34,808
one of y'all niggas
know Baby Boy?

891
00:41:38,389 --> 00:41:40,789
Chris and Neef.

892
00:41:40,858 --> 00:41:43,053
I usually ain't mess
with young bulls.

893
00:41:43,127 --> 00:41:45,288
But these weren't your average
little young bulls.

894
00:41:45,362 --> 00:41:48,126
I mean, these dudes
was totally different.

895
00:41:48,198 --> 00:41:50,428
They was little Gunz.

896
00:41:50,501 --> 00:41:52,025
I know you have it.

897
00:41:52,102 --> 00:41:54,434
See this shit? Go get whoever
the fuck you want.

898
00:41:54,505 --> 00:41:55,802
You little bastard.

899
00:41:55,873 --> 00:41:57,306
I'm tired of
you little motherfuckers...

900
00:41:57,374 --> 00:41:59,171
coming around here.
Go get your fucking 0-8.

901
00:41:59,243 --> 00:42:00,835
I knew there was something
special about them...

902
00:42:00,911 --> 00:42:03,243
when they took over
Fat Stevie's block.

903
00:42:03,314 --> 00:42:05,839
And they was about,
what, 14, 15?

904
00:42:05,916 --> 00:42:07,884
- This motherfucker right here?
- Yeah.

905
00:42:09,553 --> 00:42:10,713
And my man Chris...

906
00:42:10,788 --> 00:42:13,018
he handled that shit
like a grown man.

907
00:42:13,090 --> 00:42:15,024
Who block is it now, pussy?

908
00:42:17,294 --> 00:42:19,455
I was hitting Chris and Neef
5-0 bricks...

909
00:42:19,530 --> 00:42:20,997
when they was, like, 16.

910
00:42:21,065 --> 00:42:23,033
And the whole time
they was hustling...

911
00:42:23,100 --> 00:42:25,591
they was going to school.

912
00:42:25,669 --> 00:42:28,866
I mean, like, they was really
fucking going to school.

913
00:42:42,319 --> 00:42:44,753
Nah, fam.
I don't know no Baby Boy.

914
00:42:44,822 --> 00:42:46,813
Well, a friend of mine
said I could find...

915
00:42:46,890 --> 00:42:48,949
Baby Boy over here.

916
00:42:49,026 --> 00:42:52,291
Oh, yeah?
What friend would that be?

917
00:42:52,363 --> 00:42:55,491
Beans, nigga.

918
00:42:55,566 --> 00:42:59,366
Nah. Wouldn't say Beans, playa.

919
00:42:59,436 --> 00:43:01,063
Well, figga deal me on this.

920
00:43:01,138 --> 00:43:04,437
If you happen to fall and trip
and bump into the nigga...

921
00:43:04,508 --> 00:43:07,272
let him know El Pollo Loco
came through.

922
00:43:07,344 --> 00:43:08,936
Feliz Navidad.

923
00:43:09,013 --> 00:43:10,503
El Pollo Loco?

924
00:43:10,581 --> 00:43:12,481
Yeah, OK, Papi.

925
00:43:12,549 --> 00:43:14,107
What'd he say, Loco?

926
00:43:14,184 --> 00:43:15,651
Get yourself Pollo Loco?

927
00:43:15,719 --> 00:43:16,811
Yeah, man, this clown here.

928
00:43:16,887 --> 00:43:18,286
Oh, yeah? Oh.

929
00:43:18,355 --> 00:43:21,381
Oh, man, well, if it ain't
the infamous El Pollo Loco.

930
00:43:21,458 --> 00:43:22,789
What's up, playboy?

931
00:43:22,860 --> 00:43:23,986
I'm Baby Boy.
What's the situation?

932
00:43:24,061 --> 00:43:25,221
Hey, what's up, man?

933
00:43:25,295 --> 00:43:27,525
- This is Biggis right here.
- What's up, dawg?

934
00:43:27,598 --> 00:43:29,691
Hey, I thought you was Spanish.

935
00:43:29,767 --> 00:43:31,928
Nigga-Rican...
black and Spanish.

936
00:43:32,002 --> 00:43:34,436
Yeah? So, what bring
y'all through here?

937
00:43:34,505 --> 00:43:36,234
Check this out, man.
Why don't you hop in the car...

938
00:43:36,306 --> 00:43:38,069
we'll go get some bacalao,
some arroz con pollo.

939
00:43:38,142 --> 00:43:39,336
Get you right.

940
00:43:39,410 --> 00:43:40,536
Figga deal me,
we get you a gordito.

941
00:43:40,611 --> 00:43:42,772
- Come on, man.
- OK. Yo, I'll be right back.

942
00:43:42,846 --> 00:43:44,473
I'm gonna holler
at my new friends, a'ight?

943
00:43:44,548 --> 00:43:45,708
- Yeah.
- I'll be back.

944
00:43:45,783 --> 00:43:46,909
You know,
I love these guala-gualas.

945
00:43:46,984 --> 00:43:48,349
Yeah. We'll send him back...

946
00:43:48,419 --> 00:43:50,580
with a lot of arroz con pollo
in his system.

947
00:43:50,654 --> 00:43:52,144
Figga deal me?

948
00:43:56,994 --> 00:43:59,895
Loco explained the situation
to Baby Boy.

949
00:43:59,963 --> 00:44:01,089
The first thing he had to do...

950
00:44:01,165 --> 00:44:03,599
was pick up a package
that belonged to El Plaga.

951
00:44:03,667 --> 00:44:05,259
That's all he said.

952
00:44:05,335 --> 00:44:07,701
He didn't say who they was
supposed to get it from...

953
00:44:07,771 --> 00:44:09,705
or how they was supposed
to get it.

954
00:44:09,773 --> 00:44:12,833
Only thing he said was that
the package was stashed...

955
00:44:12,910 --> 00:44:14,673
in a bathroom
at this burger joint.

956
00:44:14,745 --> 00:44:16,076
Keep the car running, gun.

957
00:44:16,146 --> 00:44:17,408
You know what to do
if something happen.

958
00:44:17,481 --> 00:44:19,381
- Oh, yeah, I got you.
- A'ight.

959
00:44:19,450 --> 00:44:21,975
The package is
at the burger spot in Philly.

960
00:44:22,052 --> 00:44:24,452
Now, don't take these niggas
for suckers.

961
00:44:24,521 --> 00:44:25,988
Watch your back.

962
00:44:26,056 --> 00:44:29,685
When you get that package,
bring it straight to me.

963
00:44:29,760 --> 00:44:33,218
Do not open it.
Don't fuck with me.

964
00:44:33,297 --> 00:44:34,559
You pull this off...

965
00:44:34,631 --> 00:44:36,656
I'll probably get your boy
back on the street...

966
00:44:36,734 --> 00:44:39,430
and I'll throw you
some real work.

967
00:44:40,971 --> 00:44:42,768
Yo, Rudy.

968
00:44:42,840 --> 00:44:43,829
Yo, Fanlan!

969
00:44:43,907 --> 00:44:45,033
Yeah, yeah. What's up, baby?

970
00:44:45,109 --> 00:44:46,371
Yeah. Can I help you?

971
00:44:50,948 --> 00:44:53,280
Yeah, what's up, man?
What you need?

972
00:44:53,350 --> 00:44:56,046
Yeah. What you got
good back there?

973
00:44:56,120 --> 00:44:58,179
The hamburgers is good.
They're handmade.

974
00:44:59,656 --> 00:45:00,816
You want a hamburger?

975
00:45:02,292 --> 00:45:04,226
All right, give me a burger.

976
00:45:04,294 --> 00:45:06,057
OK. A burger, coming up.

977
00:45:07,264 --> 00:45:08,788
Rudy, you got a bathroom, man?

978
00:45:08,866 --> 00:45:10,390
It's right there.

979
00:45:10,467 --> 00:45:11,593
All right.

980
00:45:42,599 --> 00:45:44,226
Hey, yo,
how about your burger, man?

981
00:45:44,301 --> 00:45:45,859
I'm cool, fam.

982
00:45:45,936 --> 00:45:47,494
Hey, yo, pard, come here.
Let me holler at you.

983
00:45:47,571 --> 00:45:48,629
What the fuck y'all want?

984
00:45:48,705 --> 00:45:50,332
Come here for a minute, dawg.

985
00:45:50,407 --> 00:45:51,772
Fuckin' holler later.

986
00:45:54,344 --> 00:45:55,470
Gotta go.

987
00:46:08,158 --> 00:46:10,524
Goddamn, fam,
y'all could've told me...

988
00:46:10,594 --> 00:46:12,528
we was running into some shit.
We get to the spot.

989
00:46:12,596 --> 00:46:13,620
Motherfuckers
shooting at us and shit.

990
00:46:13,697 --> 00:46:14,857
What the fuck is that about?

991
00:46:14,932 --> 00:46:16,991
It's all gravy down, nigga.
Good job.

992
00:46:17,067 --> 00:46:18,694
Where the package at?

993
00:46:18,769 --> 00:46:20,566
What? Your package?

994
00:46:20,637 --> 00:46:22,537
Who the fuck do he think he is?

995
00:46:22,606 --> 00:46:24,471
El Pollo Loco.

996
00:46:24,541 --> 00:46:26,475
I put my life on the line
for this nigga...

997
00:46:26,543 --> 00:46:28,135
and all he want is his package.

998
00:46:28,212 --> 00:46:29,645
Man, fuck that nigga.

999
00:46:30,681 --> 00:46:32,478
The package, nigga.

1000
00:46:32,549 --> 00:46:33,982
Yeah.

1001
00:46:34,051 --> 00:46:36,315
Here's your package, fam.

1002
00:46:36,386 --> 00:46:38,513
You lucky I ain't
look in that shit, nigga.

1003
00:46:38,589 --> 00:46:40,580
Now, we can take care of that
for your man Beans.

1004
00:46:40,657 --> 00:46:41,783
Let's get down
to business, though.

1005
00:46:48,465 --> 00:46:49,625
It's all there.

1006
00:46:49,700 --> 00:46:52,032
Yeah. We need 90 grand
in two weeks, man.

1007
00:46:53,570 --> 00:46:54,901
Hold up.

1008
00:46:54,972 --> 00:46:56,166
Now, who the fuck is this nigga?

1009
00:46:56,240 --> 00:46:58,003
Biggis. Now he want me
to pay him...

1010
00:46:58,075 --> 00:47:00,373
for the shit that I stole?
Man, fuck him, too.

1011
00:47:00,444 --> 00:47:01,638
Let me get this shit right, fam.

1012
00:47:01,712 --> 00:47:03,236
You mean to tell me
we gonna pay you...

1013
00:47:03,313 --> 00:47:05,304
90 grand off the shit
we just took?

1014
00:47:05,382 --> 00:47:06,679
Off that shit right there?

1015
00:47:06,750 --> 00:47:09,617
Now, I've been with Biggis
for oddeen years.

1016
00:47:09,686 --> 00:47:12,382
He almost never blows his cool.

1017
00:47:13,624 --> 00:47:15,455
But the one thing
that always gets him heated...

1018
00:47:15,525 --> 00:47:16,992
is saying the same thing twice.

1019
00:47:17,060 --> 00:47:18,527
What the fuck I just say, card?

1020
00:47:18,595 --> 00:47:22,759
Biggis hated to repeat hisself.

1021
00:47:24,034 --> 00:47:25,524
Two weeks, man.

1022
00:47:26,770 --> 00:47:27,862
You can keep the bag.

1023
00:47:32,509 --> 00:47:34,636
Now, who the fuck these niggas
think they is?

1024
00:47:34,711 --> 00:47:35,939
Man, fuck them...

1025
00:47:36,013 --> 00:47:37,446
and fuck everybody.

1026
00:47:37,514 --> 00:47:38,879
Matter of fact, fuck you.

1027
00:47:38,949 --> 00:47:40,177
You know what, D?

1028
00:47:40,250 --> 00:47:41,911
I'm gonna murder
one of them niggas right there.

1029
00:47:41,985 --> 00:47:43,919
I'm gonna murder one of them
niggas right there.

1030
00:47:43,987 --> 00:47:46,512
And just like that,
it was back on.

1031
00:47:48,158 --> 00:47:50,888
Regardless how wild or crazy
my crew appeared...

1032
00:47:50,961 --> 00:47:54,419
man, the one thing we always
knew how to do was hustling.

1033
00:47:54,498 --> 00:47:56,932
So, Baby Boy, D-Nice,
and the Young Gunz...

1034
00:47:57,000 --> 00:47:59,025
got all our people together...

1035
00:47:59,102 --> 00:48:01,696
and once again,
we flooded the streets.

1036
00:48:01,772 --> 00:48:04,502
I mean, everything was moving.

1037
00:48:07,144 --> 00:48:10,272
1,000, 2,000, 3,000.

1038
00:48:10,347 --> 00:48:11,439
Man, we back, nigga.

1039
00:48:11,515 --> 00:48:14,313
They can't count us
the fuck out now.

1040
00:48:14,384 --> 00:48:16,215
Yeah.

1041
00:48:18,522 --> 00:48:20,490
This is what the fuck
I'm talking about. We back.

1042
00:48:20,557 --> 00:48:23,754
Hey, yo,
you move the slowest shit.

1043
00:48:23,827 --> 00:48:25,556
Get the fuck out of here, nigga.

1044
00:48:25,629 --> 00:48:27,290
Getting this money is
what the fuck I'm doing, nigga.

1045
00:48:27,364 --> 00:48:28,456
Hello?

1046
00:48:28,532 --> 00:48:29,556
Loco, nigga.

1047
00:48:29,633 --> 00:48:30,622
Yeah, I know who this is.
What's up?

1048
00:48:30,701 --> 00:48:31,929
You got that bread next week?

1049
00:48:32,002 --> 00:48:33,993
Next week?
Nigga, you can have it tonight.

1050
00:48:34,071 --> 00:48:36,130
Matter of fact, wait till
tomorrow, El Poco Loco.

1051
00:48:36,206 --> 00:48:37,434
This nigga funny as shit, man.

1052
00:48:37,507 --> 00:48:39,975
- Clown ass.
- Yo, man, funny as shit, man.

1053
00:48:40,043 --> 00:48:42,944
This is what I'm about to do.

1054
00:48:43,013 --> 00:48:45,174
I'm goin' back to the block
and get some more of this money.

1055
00:48:45,248 --> 00:48:47,045
This ain't no money, man.
This is their money.

1056
00:48:47,117 --> 00:48:48,982
I need my money. Huh?

1057
00:48:49,052 --> 00:48:51,247
- Where you going with that?
- What the fuck you mean?

1058
00:48:51,321 --> 00:48:53,221
I see a nigga
with a hundred something grand.

1059
00:48:53,290 --> 00:48:54,780
Nigga, you out
your rabid ass mind.

1060
00:48:54,858 --> 00:48:56,291
Where y'all burners at?

1061
00:48:56,360 --> 00:48:58,055
You know niggas got caught up,
had to toss them burners...

1062
00:48:58,128 --> 00:49:00,619
- Cut it the fuck out, man.
- Are you serious?

1063
00:49:00,697 --> 00:49:03,165
Beans was right.
His crew was true hustlers.

1064
00:49:03,233 --> 00:49:07,135
Baby Boy told me he had
my 90 grand five days early.

1065
00:49:08,939 --> 00:49:11,772
Apparently, El Plaga was
real happy when he heard that...

1066
00:49:11,842 --> 00:49:14,504
but he still wanted me
to holler at the Dame nigga.

1067
00:49:14,578 --> 00:49:16,637
I been in Philly for four years.

1068
00:49:16,713 --> 00:49:19,546
I still ain't
want to meet this nigga.

1069
00:49:19,616 --> 00:49:22,449
But El Plaga figured
if I hook up with him...

1070
00:49:22,519 --> 00:49:24,817
then there'd be
no one standing in my way...

1071
00:49:24,888 --> 00:49:27,686
so I paid Dame
a little visit at his spot.

1072
00:49:37,734 --> 00:49:39,861
My name is Dame.

1073
00:49:39,936 --> 00:49:41,961
My good friends call me...

1074
00:49:42,806 --> 00:49:44,398
Dame.

1075
00:49:44,808 --> 00:49:46,105
Some of my other friends
call me...

1076
00:49:46,176 --> 00:49:48,406
Young Fresh to Death...

1077
00:49:48,478 --> 00:49:50,105
'cause I love to pop tags.

1078
00:49:50,180 --> 00:49:51,977
I'm the head of The Umbrella.

1079
00:49:52,049 --> 00:49:55,018
If you ain't under it,
you're gonna get drenched.

1080
00:49:55,085 --> 00:49:56,882
I came up on
the streets of New York.

1081
00:49:56,953 --> 00:49:58,511
We were crack broke...

1082
00:49:58,588 --> 00:50:01,056
not even a pair of decent kicks.

1083
00:50:04,194 --> 00:50:06,788
Psych, I'll always be
fresh to death.

1084
00:50:06,863 --> 00:50:09,161
You see, I got this problem.

1085
00:50:09,232 --> 00:50:10,995
I'm addicted to getting money.

1086
00:50:11,068 --> 00:50:12,433
I need all the dough.

1087
00:50:12,502 --> 00:50:13,935
Some call me greedy.

1088
00:50:14,004 --> 00:50:16,029
I call myself a cakeaholic.

1089
00:50:16,106 --> 00:50:19,007
So I do all kind of things
to make all kind of money.

1090
00:50:19,076 --> 00:50:21,840
You should already know
I'm a super duper big cat...

1091
00:50:21,912 --> 00:50:23,106
so of course I pick up...

1092
00:50:23,180 --> 00:50:24,511
about a hundred of them things
from the airport...

1093
00:50:24,581 --> 00:50:25,878
and I do it in style.

1094
00:50:25,949 --> 00:50:27,678
I got the baddest chick
on the planet...

1095
00:50:27,751 --> 00:50:29,013
delivering it to me.

1096
00:50:29,086 --> 00:50:31,554
She'll do anything I say...
a real soldier.

1097
00:50:31,621 --> 00:50:33,350
I tell her what to do,
and she does it...

1098
00:50:33,423 --> 00:50:34,822
no questions asked.

1099
00:50:34,891 --> 00:50:36,222
She loves me to death.

1100
00:50:36,293 --> 00:50:38,454
Hello? You going to make me
carry the bags by myself...

1101
00:50:38,528 --> 00:50:40,291
all that way, motherfucker?

1102
00:50:40,363 --> 00:50:43,594
First of all,
you promised me a G-4...

1103
00:50:43,667 --> 00:50:45,134
not a Challenger.

1104
00:50:45,202 --> 00:50:46,863
I might as well be flying coach.

1105
00:50:46,937 --> 00:50:48,928
That's, like, a thousand dollar
fine right there.

1106
00:50:50,240 --> 00:50:53,073
And second of all,
that freeze-dried food.

1107
00:50:53,143 --> 00:50:54,474
You better be taking me
to Mr. Chow's...

1108
00:50:54,544 --> 00:50:55,943
for some squab right now...

1109
00:50:56,012 --> 00:50:57,479
because that shit
was disgusting.

1110
00:50:58,648 --> 00:51:00,616
And by the way,
look at my boots.

1111
00:51:00,684 --> 00:51:02,049
These are my favorite boots.

1112
00:51:02,119 --> 00:51:03,347
I got water stains
on my boots...

1113
00:51:03,420 --> 00:51:06,150
because that dumb ass
flight attendant...

1114
00:51:06,223 --> 00:51:07,520
spilled Evian
all over my boots.

1115
00:51:07,591 --> 00:51:10,151
That's two more grand
for the boots.

1116
00:51:10,227 --> 00:51:13,287
You know what?
Step your game up a little bit.

1117
00:51:13,363 --> 00:51:15,558
You're taking me shopping.

1118
00:51:15,632 --> 00:51:19,534
Nice to see you, too.
Get the fuck in the car.

1119
00:51:19,603 --> 00:51:22,595
Now, to the average dude,
that alone would be enough...

1120
00:51:22,672 --> 00:51:24,572
but I'm not lazy.

1121
00:51:24,641 --> 00:51:26,336
Tell them
I want my money by Tuesday.

1122
00:51:26,409 --> 00:51:29,537
Like I told y'all,
I'm addicted to getting money.

1123
00:51:29,613 --> 00:51:32,446
So, I hit a select few with
a couple of burns at a time...

1124
00:51:32,516 --> 00:51:34,711
but also break them down
brick by brick.

1125
00:51:34,784 --> 00:51:37,344
There's some key, halves.

1126
00:51:37,420 --> 00:51:39,285
There's some quarters.
There's some eighths...

1127
00:51:39,356 --> 00:51:41,620
ounces, half-ounces.

1128
00:51:41,691 --> 00:51:42,817
I even cook
the shit up myself...

1129
00:51:42,893 --> 00:51:44,827
because I got to get
all them extras.

1130
00:51:44,895 --> 00:51:47,159
I chop it up, bottle it up.

1131
00:51:47,230 --> 00:51:50,666
You see it, right?
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah!

1132
00:51:50,734 --> 00:51:53,828
Pass some dimes, nicks, tres...

1133
00:51:53,904 --> 00:51:56,338
two for fives,
even two-dollar bottles.

1134
00:51:56,406 --> 00:51:58,704
If I could,
I'd pitch them shits myself...

1135
00:51:58,775 --> 00:52:00,868
but there's
only 24 hours in a day...

1136
00:52:00,944 --> 00:52:03,071
and there's only one Dame.

1137
00:52:03,146 --> 00:52:05,876
You see, I'm an executive,
a businessman.

1138
00:52:05,949 --> 00:52:08,417
Some even call me a CEO.

1139
00:52:08,485 --> 00:52:09,952
And in
my international quest...

1140
00:52:10,020 --> 00:52:11,817
for greatness
and worldwide domination...

1141
00:52:11,888 --> 00:52:13,355
you know
I couldn't do it alone...

1142
00:52:13,423 --> 00:52:14,947
so I have a lot of ill crews...

1143
00:52:15,025 --> 00:52:16,822
set up in
a lot of different places.

1144
00:52:18,495 --> 00:52:20,656
Man, pull over.

1145
00:52:21,865 --> 00:52:22,957
What the fuck is that?

1146
00:52:23,033 --> 00:52:25,399
Now, the Dip Set
ran Harlem for me...

1147
00:52:25,468 --> 00:52:27,265
bein' young Juelz Santana...

1148
00:52:27,337 --> 00:52:28,395
What?

1149
00:52:28,471 --> 00:52:31,463
Stupid.

1150
00:52:31,541 --> 00:52:33,008
Jimmy Jones...

1151
00:52:33,076 --> 00:52:35,306
He's buggin'.

1152
00:52:35,378 --> 00:52:36,606
And the leader of that clique...

1153
00:52:36,680 --> 00:52:37,647
Stupid.

1154
00:52:37,714 --> 00:52:39,511
Cam'ron.

1155
00:52:51,361 --> 00:52:52,953
And like
any good Harlem crew...

1156
00:52:53,029 --> 00:52:55,293
they handled their business
with style and class...

1157
00:52:55,365 --> 00:52:57,094
sophistication...

1158
00:52:57,167 --> 00:53:00,568
and above all,
they were very subtle.

1159
00:53:10,280 --> 00:53:11,304
Close the trunk.

1160
00:53:11,381 --> 00:53:13,849
Oh, yeah.
Did I forget to mention...

1161
00:53:13,917 --> 00:53:15,612
they had a love
for the color pink?

1162
00:53:17,120 --> 00:53:19,645
And my crew up in Brooklyn
was called MOP...

1163
00:53:19,723 --> 00:53:21,156
the Mash Out Posse.

1164
00:53:21,224 --> 00:53:22,987
And they weren't
very sophisticated...

1165
00:53:23,059 --> 00:53:24,617
but they got the job done.

1166
00:53:30,133 --> 00:53:33,398
In Chicago, we had
different kind of hustlers.

1167
00:53:33,470 --> 00:53:35,597
We had Kanye West
and the Kan-Men.

1168
00:53:37,974 --> 00:53:40,374
Now, they did things
with a little more finesse...

1169
00:53:40,443 --> 00:53:43,037
you know,
an intellectual approach.

1170
00:53:52,589 --> 00:53:54,056
Here in the neighborhood...

1171
00:53:54,124 --> 00:53:56,922
we called them
trendy, fashionable thugs.

1172
00:53:58,061 --> 00:53:59,995
For a sting on
my international grisly...

1173
00:54:00,063 --> 00:54:02,793
and in my quest for greatness
and worldwide domination...

1174
00:54:02,866 --> 00:54:05,232
it only makes sense for my arms
to extend to the UK.

1175
00:54:05,302 --> 00:54:07,736
I got with a crew called SAS.

1176
00:54:07,804 --> 00:54:10,364
They did things the UK way.

1177
00:54:10,440 --> 00:54:12,533
Hello? Who's this?

1178
00:54:12,609 --> 00:54:15,134
Oh. Oh, yeah, that thing.

1179
00:54:15,211 --> 00:54:17,179
Yeah, all right.

1180
00:54:17,247 --> 00:54:18,373
Let's go.

1181
00:54:22,319 --> 00:54:24,184
Hey! Stop!

1182
00:54:37,000 --> 00:54:38,661
What's going on?

1183
00:54:38,735 --> 00:54:40,225
Lovely weather we're havin'.

1184
00:54:45,275 --> 00:54:48,244
And don't think just anybody
can get under this Umbrella.

1185
00:54:48,311 --> 00:54:51,439
Number one, you got to be
a cakeaholic just like me...

1186
00:54:51,514 --> 00:54:53,482
meaning
always stay on the grisly.

1187
00:54:53,550 --> 00:54:56,110
And number two,
don't take any shit.

1188
00:54:56,186 --> 00:54:58,154
Always be thorough.

1189
00:54:58,221 --> 00:54:59,848
And number three,
I would suggest...

1190
00:54:59,923 --> 00:55:02,323
you stay fresh to death
and always pop tag...

1191
00:55:02,392 --> 00:55:04,656
because you will get teed.

1192
00:55:07,397 --> 00:55:09,422
Yo, cabinet face,
get the fuck out of here.

1193
00:55:09,499 --> 00:55:10,727
Look like... look like...

1194
00:55:10,800 --> 00:55:12,791
Whoopi Goldberg
tongue kissed him.

1195
00:55:12,869 --> 00:55:15,167
Yeah. She had
a seizure yesterday.

1196
00:55:16,406 --> 00:55:20,308
Feel like a witch doctor
put a curse on him.

1197
00:55:20,377 --> 00:55:24,746
He look like Michael Jackson
got blown up with a Pepsi.

1198
00:55:24,814 --> 00:55:28,443
He look like Ziggy Marley's
little brother.

1199
00:55:28,518 --> 00:55:30,315
Teddy Pendergrass' bodyguard.

1200
00:55:30,387 --> 00:55:32,446
He look like
a Cabbage Patch voodoo doll.

1201
00:55:32,522 --> 00:55:33,955
If you front with me
on anything...

1202
00:55:34,023 --> 00:55:36,548
never take my light-heartedness
for weakness.

1203
00:55:37,827 --> 00:55:40,227
Man, suck my dick.

1204
00:55:41,965 --> 00:55:44,627
Don't worry. I can take a joke.

1205
00:55:53,777 --> 00:55:56,507
Now you look like
a dead voodoo doll.

1206
00:56:01,217 --> 00:56:04,448
So, anyway,
as I said before...

1207
00:56:04,521 --> 00:56:06,455
I'm a cakeaholic.

1208
00:56:06,523 --> 00:56:08,548
My crew's cakeaholic.

1209
00:56:08,625 --> 00:56:11,458
We love to get money,
and we love to have fun.

1210
00:56:11,528 --> 00:56:15,089
We don't take no shit,
and it's death before dishonor.

1211
00:56:15,165 --> 00:56:16,860
Win by all costs.

1212
00:56:16,933 --> 00:56:19,026
Be scared of no one.

1213
00:56:19,102 --> 00:56:20,694
And that's the Umbrella.

1214
00:56:20,770 --> 00:56:23,603
You're either under it,
or you're gonna get drenched.

1215
00:56:23,673 --> 00:56:26,039
No ifs, ands, or buts about it.

1216
00:56:26,109 --> 00:56:27,576
Holler.

1217
00:56:29,646 --> 00:56:31,375
Hey, Big Figgitty.

1218
00:56:31,448 --> 00:56:32,574
What up, Dame?

1219
00:56:32,649 --> 00:56:34,014
You know my man Winky?

1220
00:56:34,083 --> 00:56:35,607
Nah.

1221
00:56:35,685 --> 00:56:36,947
He'll knock you the fuck out.

1222
00:56:37,020 --> 00:56:38,487
You got to be
out your fucking mind.

1223
00:56:38,555 --> 00:56:40,580
I'm 30 and 0
in the fucking street.

1224
00:56:43,893 --> 00:56:46,555
So I paid Dame
a visit at his spot...

1225
00:56:46,629 --> 00:56:49,757
told him who I was
and who I worked for.

1226
00:56:49,833 --> 00:56:53,269
He played it cool, but
I could tell he was interested.

1227
00:56:56,172 --> 00:56:58,640
El Pollo Loco.

1228
00:56:58,708 --> 00:57:00,437
El Pollo Loco?

1229
00:57:00,510 --> 00:57:03,035
El Pollo.
But it's all gravy, dad.

1230
00:57:03,112 --> 00:57:04,545
I heard that.

1231
00:57:04,614 --> 00:57:08,675
I work with El Plaga.
You figga deal me?

1232
00:57:08,751 --> 00:57:10,343
El Plaga?

1233
00:57:10,420 --> 00:57:12,081
Yeah, El Plaga.

1234
00:57:12,155 --> 00:57:14,055
Old Slithery.

1235
00:57:14,123 --> 00:57:16,717
That's a posito
on that jump-off.

1236
00:57:16,793 --> 00:57:19,091
I really don't talk business
after 8:00.

1237
00:57:19,162 --> 00:57:21,130
Yeah.

1238
00:57:21,197 --> 00:57:23,461
Look like you jump off
after 8:00.

1239
00:57:26,870 --> 00:57:30,772
Well, I'm with all that,
you fly motherfucker.

1240
00:57:30,840 --> 00:57:34,173
Hey, we some fly bum-ass niggas.

1241
00:57:34,244 --> 00:57:35,711
I'm going to get with you
another time.

1242
00:57:35,778 --> 00:57:37,439
OK, my nigga.

1243
00:57:37,514 --> 00:57:38,572
Tell Slithery.

1244
00:57:38,648 --> 00:57:40,309
Use your peoples, too.

1245
00:57:42,318 --> 00:57:44,616
Some Miami cat Loco...

1246
00:57:44,687 --> 00:57:47,087
told me El Plaga could help me
take over Philly.

1247
00:57:47,156 --> 00:57:49,852
I told him
I already had Philly.

1248
00:57:49,926 --> 00:57:51,826
But then his man came back
the next day...

1249
00:57:51,895 --> 00:57:54,591
with an offer
that did sound interesting.

1250
00:57:54,664 --> 00:57:57,189
They got something
that belong to El Plaga.

1251
00:57:57,267 --> 00:57:59,292
You get it back,
he'll give you other work.

1252
00:57:59,369 --> 00:58:03,169
Know what I mean?
There's the address.

1253
00:58:03,239 --> 00:58:04,797
So, let me get this straight.

1254
00:58:04,874 --> 00:58:07,069
I'm going to send my boys
to pick that up for El Plaga...

1255
00:58:07,143 --> 00:58:08,633
and your man going to give us
a hundred of them things...

1256
00:58:08,711 --> 00:58:10,508
at 10,000 a clip?

1257
00:58:10,580 --> 00:58:13,071
What the fuck I say, card?

1258
00:58:18,521 --> 00:58:20,682
Don't open the package.

1259
00:58:23,126 --> 00:58:24,525
You just going to let him
stare you down...

1260
00:58:24,594 --> 00:58:26,585
like that, big man, huh?

1261
00:58:29,165 --> 00:58:31,292
I was on my way
to meet the boy Loco...

1262
00:58:31,367 --> 00:58:33,835
to give him his little 90...

1263
00:58:33,903 --> 00:58:37,566
and you won't believe
what the fuck happened next.

1264
00:58:48,051 --> 00:58:49,814
Man, get the fuck outta here!

1265
00:58:49,886 --> 00:58:50,910
Ain't this a bitch?

1266
00:58:50,987 --> 00:58:52,682
Gentlemen, gentlemen,
good evening.

1267
00:58:52,755 --> 00:58:54,484
How y'all doing?

1268
00:58:54,557 --> 00:58:55,581
You all right?

1269
00:58:55,658 --> 00:58:56,784
Nigga, you serious?

1270
00:58:56,859 --> 00:58:57,848
Think you gonna rob us
in a pink fuckin' robe?

1271
00:58:57,927 --> 00:58:59,292
Nigga,
you out your fuckin' mind.

1272
00:58:59,362 --> 00:59:01,125
A'ight, y'all.
Don't kill me tonight, fam.

1273
00:59:01,197 --> 00:59:02,323
Do right.

1274
00:59:02,398 --> 00:59:04,127
Give me the fucking bag.

1275
00:59:04,200 --> 00:59:06,964
Give me the fucking bag,
George Jefferson.

1276
00:59:07,036 --> 00:59:08,867
You gentlemen
have a good night, man.

1277
00:59:08,938 --> 00:59:11,429
Give everybody my love
from the West U Crew, man.

1278
00:59:11,507 --> 00:59:15,170
I'm gonna count this green money
in our pink SUV.

1279
00:59:15,244 --> 00:59:16,939
Good night, gentlemen.

1280
00:59:17,013 --> 00:59:18,378
Get the fuck outta here.

1281
00:59:18,448 --> 00:59:21,110
A'ight. OK.

1282
00:59:21,184 --> 00:59:23,948
Get the fuck outta here.
Get the fuck...

1283
00:59:26,656 --> 00:59:28,783
Who the fuck, man?!

1284
00:59:28,858 --> 00:59:30,291
Yo, I can't believe

1285
00:59:30,360 --> 00:59:31,554
We just got knelt

1286
00:59:31,628 --> 00:59:32,754
The whole 90, man!

1287
00:59:32,829 --> 00:59:33,853
Y'all know
who the fuck it was?!

1288
00:59:33,930 --> 00:59:34,897
Who was it?

1289
00:59:34,964 --> 00:59:36,556
Them Harlem niggas
work for Dame.

1290
00:59:36,633 --> 00:59:39,124
- How you know it was Dame?
- Nigga, how I know...

1291
00:59:39,202 --> 00:59:41,397
Y'all see that pink fuckin'
robe flying around there?

1292
00:59:41,471 --> 00:59:43,405
Ass whup that nigga!
Yo, man, I'm gonna mur...

00:59:44,907 --> 00:59:46,238
Man, I'm gonna shoot
everybody I see, man.

1295
00:59:46,309 --> 00:59:48,300
Cool the fuck out, man.
You know damn well...

1296
00:59:48,378 --> 00:59:50,573
we need to holler at Beans
before we do anything.

1297
00:59:50,647 --> 00:59:52,012
Holler at Beans?!

1298
00:59:52,081 --> 00:59:54,481
Beans got 15 to 30!
Nigga, what the fuck...

1299
00:59:54,550 --> 00:59:56,040
We ain't gotta wait
for the nigga to come home.

1300
00:59:56,119 --> 00:59:57,814
We can holler at him, see if
word came through the jail.

1301
00:59:57,887 --> 00:59:59,514
Came through the...
Motherfucker, nigga is you...

1302
00:59:59,589 --> 01:00:00,954
D, you ain't movin'?

1303
01:00:01,024 --> 01:00:03,584
You ain't movin', D?!
You ain't... Fuck that!

1304
01:00:03,660 --> 01:00:05,355
We in the hole for 90...
You ain't movin'?!

1305
01:00:05,428 --> 01:00:07,453
Fuck y'all, nigga!
Get the fuck...

1306
01:00:07,530 --> 01:00:09,896
Listen, I got him.
Cool out. I got him.

1307
01:00:20,243 --> 01:00:21,574
May I help you?

1308
01:00:21,644 --> 01:00:23,771
- Collect.
- And your name?

1309
01:00:23,846 --> 01:00:25,438
D-Nice and them
should have known better.

1310
01:00:25,515 --> 01:00:26,846
Beans.

1311
01:00:26,916 --> 01:00:29,851
I knew about Baby Boy's stick up
as soon as it happened.

1312
01:00:29,919 --> 01:00:31,352
See, when you in here...

1313
01:00:31,421 --> 01:00:33,013
you hear everything
that go on in the street.

1314
01:00:33,089 --> 01:00:35,853
Sometimes even before
the street know.

1315
01:00:35,925 --> 01:00:37,859
What the fi-diddy-duh?

1316
01:00:37,927 --> 01:00:38,951
Collect call.

1317
01:00:39,028 --> 01:00:40,495
- Collect call?
- Yes, from Beans.

1318
01:00:40,563 --> 01:00:44,329
Beans? Hell, no,
I ain't accept no collect call.

1319
01:00:44,400 --> 01:00:45,731
I ain't allowed to associate...

1320
01:00:45,802 --> 01:00:48,498
with convicted fe-di-delons
anyway.

1321
01:00:48,571 --> 01:00:50,300
Nigga.

1322
01:00:50,373 --> 01:00:52,273
Better have my money.

1323
01:00:52,341 --> 01:00:55,003
Now I got a beef with Loco...

1324
01:00:55,078 --> 01:00:57,046
beef with whoever we robbed...

1325
01:00:57,113 --> 01:00:59,047
I still had beef with Dame...

1326
01:00:59,115 --> 01:01:03,017
beef inside my crew,
and 90 fuckin' grand missing.

1327
01:01:03,086 --> 01:01:05,247
Whoa, slow your roll, fam.
This is Beans' phone.

1328
01:01:05,321 --> 01:01:06,413
Damn, my bad, yo.

1329
01:01:06,489 --> 01:01:08,252
Tryin' to call
my baby moms, man.

1330
01:01:08,324 --> 01:01:11,054
Man, get the fuck
outta here, man.

1331
01:01:13,563 --> 01:01:14,928
Faggot.

1332
01:01:17,600 --> 01:01:19,932
Yeah, nigga.
Yeah, you know what it is.

1333
01:01:20,002 --> 01:01:22,300
Come on, get up on here.

1334
01:01:22,371 --> 01:01:24,066
You ain't packin'
that shit, nigga.

1335
01:01:24,140 --> 01:01:25,801
Huh? You ain't...
What's that?

1336
01:01:25,875 --> 01:01:27,467
You got more money?
Oh, you a baller.

1337
01:01:27,543 --> 01:01:30,103
Somebody callin'.
He gettin' robbed right now.

1338
01:01:30,179 --> 01:01:31,476
Get your ass...

1339
01:01:31,547 --> 01:01:33,481
When you down 90 grand
and ain't got no work...

1340
01:01:33,549 --> 01:01:35,380
what else you supposed to do?

1341
01:01:35,451 --> 01:01:37,442
You rob.
You rob everything in sight.

1342
01:01:37,520 --> 01:01:39,181
No questions asked.

1343
01:01:39,255 --> 01:01:41,849
Shit, that's what the fuck
I did best anyway.

1344
01:01:45,128 --> 01:01:47,426
Shit, I was scrapin' up paper
on every block.

1345
01:01:47,497 --> 01:01:49,692
36 hours straight.
I ain't get no rest.

1346
01:01:49,766 --> 01:01:53,532
I had to get that 90 Gs up
or we was over.

1347
01:02:02,645 --> 01:02:04,704
You dirty motherfuckers
bet somethin'.

1348
01:02:04,847 --> 01:02:06,781
- What y'all bettin'?
- 290.

1349
01:02:06,849 --> 01:02:09,147
Even your man
Mr. Calm, Cool, and Collected...

1350
01:02:09,218 --> 01:02:11,277
D-Nice was bugging out.

1351
01:02:12,789 --> 01:02:14,950
He caught himself getting back
rollin' dice...

1352
01:02:15,024 --> 01:02:18,084
he ended up losing his cool
a little bit.

1353
01:02:18,161 --> 01:02:20,220
Here's your number, nigga.

1354
01:02:24,834 --> 01:02:28,668
Shit, owing niggas money
get under that nigga's skin.

1355
01:02:28,738 --> 01:02:31,298
Young is there smokin' that
g-spicer all motherfuckin' day?

1356
01:02:31,374 --> 01:02:32,807
Like we don't owe nobody
no paper, huh?

1357
01:02:32,875 --> 01:02:34,274
That nigga's crazy, man.

1358
01:02:34,343 --> 01:02:36,208
How much is that?

1359
01:02:36,279 --> 01:02:38,543
'Scuse me,
it's about 9 grand I brought.

1360
01:02:38,614 --> 01:02:40,081
Nigga, that ain't shit!

1361
01:02:40,149 --> 01:02:42,811
While you been out stickin' up
crap games, nigga...

1362
01:02:42,885 --> 01:02:44,682
we been sittin' on Dame
for like three days now.

1363
01:02:44,754 --> 01:02:47,018
He ain't never lied.
Doin' all our homework.

1364
01:02:47,089 --> 01:02:48,556
Takin' down
every license plate...

1365
01:02:48,624 --> 01:02:49,716
followin'
this nigga's bitches...

1366
01:02:49,792 --> 01:02:51,089
my bitches
gonna fuck with him.

1367
01:02:51,160 --> 01:02:54,095
License plates
and your bitches, huh?

1368
01:02:55,131 --> 01:02:56,996
That nigga's funny as shit.

1369
01:02:57,066 --> 01:02:58,124
Oh, look...

1370
01:02:59,502 --> 01:03:00,469
Hello?

1371
01:03:00,536 --> 01:03:04,131
Loco.
Have my bread in 15 flat.

1372
01:03:04,207 --> 01:03:06,767
- A'ight?
- Yeah, a'ight.

1373
01:03:07,910 --> 01:03:10,470
Pollo Loco still want his paper.

1374
01:03:10,546 --> 01:03:12,207
He say we got 15 hours.

1375
01:03:12,281 --> 01:03:14,112
See, as far as
I was concerned...

1376
01:03:14,183 --> 01:03:16,674
that nigga Loco was doing us
dirty the whole time.

1377
01:03:16,752 --> 01:03:19,312
Didn't matter.
I'm-a kill him anyway.

1378
01:03:22,458 --> 01:03:23,618
What happened?

1379
01:03:25,328 --> 01:03:27,990
I don't know, my man.

1380
01:03:29,365 --> 01:03:32,766
He supposed to get you out.

1381
01:03:32,835 --> 01:03:34,268
He's supposed to...

1382
01:03:34,337 --> 01:03:37,966
but my lawyers, man,
we ain't heard shit.

1383
01:03:39,475 --> 01:03:42,774
Now, Beans, you know
you can't trust no lawyers.

1384
01:03:44,780 --> 01:03:47,374
Man, all that shit
bullshit, man.

1385
01:03:49,685 --> 01:03:51,710
Yo, you think
that nigga El Plaga...

1386
01:03:51,787 --> 01:03:53,379
really got it like that?

1387
01:03:53,456 --> 01:03:55,048
I know he do.

1388
01:03:58,494 --> 01:04:01,657
Why you still in here, man?

1389
01:04:01,731 --> 01:04:03,892
You used to work for
that motherfucker.

1390
01:04:03,966 --> 01:04:06,298
If he wanted me out,
I'd be out.

1391
01:04:06,369 --> 01:04:09,668
When I was runnin' with Loco,
ain't nobody fuck with us.

1392
01:04:13,643 --> 01:04:16,305
But somebody set
y'all the fuck up, though.

1393
01:04:16,379 --> 01:04:19,780
And whoever that was,
I pray for him.

1394
01:04:19,849 --> 01:04:21,578
Man, this nigga act like...

1395
01:04:21,651 --> 01:04:23,551
El Plaga really got it
like that.

1396
01:04:23,619 --> 01:04:26,281
"And if he wanted me out,
I'd be out."

1397
01:04:26,355 --> 01:04:29,085
And this nigga layin' up
in here with me.

1398
01:04:32,895 --> 01:04:34,055
But you know what?

1399
01:04:34,130 --> 01:04:37,497
The very next day,
my lawyer came to holler at me.

1400
01:04:39,001 --> 01:04:42,596
He told me that the D.A.
That prosecuted me...

1401
01:04:42,672 --> 01:04:46,073
and the judge was disbarred
for accepting payoff money.

1402
01:04:46,142 --> 01:04:48,633
Now, how fucking crazy is that?

1403
01:04:51,948 --> 01:04:54,075
And just like that, I was out.

1404
01:04:54,150 --> 01:04:57,745
Man, they opened up those gates
and I was gone.

1405
01:04:59,221 --> 01:05:03,248
They didn't give me no P.O.,
no house arrest, no monitor.

1406
01:05:03,326 --> 01:05:05,726
None of that shit.

1407
01:05:05,795 --> 01:05:07,660
That was good money, too.

1408
01:05:07,730 --> 01:05:09,857
'Cause with all the bullshit
that was going on...

1409
01:05:09,932 --> 01:05:12,162
with my crew
and Loco and them...

1410
01:05:12,234 --> 01:05:14,634
shit, I had to make moves...

1411
01:05:14,704 --> 01:05:16,569
and I had to do it myself.

1412
01:05:16,639 --> 01:05:18,300
'Cause it was
about to go down...

1413
01:05:18,374 --> 01:05:21,537
and I knew the only one
that could fix it was me.

1414
01:05:29,685 --> 01:05:32,916
What's 2 plus 2?

1415
01:05:32,989 --> 01:05:34,251
Four.

1416
01:05:34,323 --> 01:05:35,381
Good girl!

1417
01:05:38,327 --> 01:05:39,988
Hold on a second.

1418
01:05:42,098 --> 01:05:43,622
What are you calling me
for today?

1419
01:05:43,699 --> 01:05:44,859
Don't you know
it's Daddy-Daughter Day?

1420
01:05:44,934 --> 01:05:47,368
Meet me at the spot.
I'll explain.

1421
01:05:47,436 --> 01:05:48,596
Call your people, man.

1422
01:05:48,671 --> 01:05:50,070
All right,
let me get this straight...

1423
01:05:52,475 --> 01:05:54,102
Don't even try, guy.

1424
01:05:54,176 --> 01:05:56,406
All right, all right. Later.

1425
01:05:58,547 --> 01:06:01,641
What's 1 plus 1?

1426
01:06:01,717 --> 01:06:02,843
Two.

1427
01:06:04,086 --> 01:06:05,986
Now, being that I did
that thing for El Plaga...

1428
01:06:06,055 --> 01:06:08,615
you know, got him back
his little 90...

1429
01:06:08,691 --> 01:06:10,420
I mean,
I could have gave him that.

1430
01:06:10,493 --> 01:06:12,017
I was just waiting for them...

1431
01:06:12,094 --> 01:06:13,857
to tell me
where to pick up my work.

1432
01:06:13,929 --> 01:06:15,954
And then your man Biggis
calls me...

1433
01:06:16,032 --> 01:06:18,091
and tells me
to meet him at 5 A.M.

1434
01:06:18,167 --> 01:06:21,193
I mean, something about this
just doesn't sit right with me.

1435
01:06:21,270 --> 01:06:22,396
Hey, listen, do me a favor.

1436
01:06:22,471 --> 01:06:23,961
Meet me around the corner
about 25 minutes.

1437
01:06:24,040 --> 01:06:25,803
You're not taking
your jacket, boss?

1438
01:06:25,875 --> 01:06:28,708
No. Thanks, though.
He's a great driver.

1439
01:06:28,778 --> 01:06:30,268
Great drivers are hard
to find these days.

1440
01:06:30,346 --> 01:06:32,246
I mean, this shit just seemed
a little fishy to me.

1441
01:06:32,314 --> 01:06:34,714
The math just wasn't adding up.

1442
01:06:34,784 --> 01:06:36,308
So I do what I always do.

1443
01:06:36,385 --> 01:06:38,114
Surrounded myself
with some people I respect...

1444
01:06:38,187 --> 01:06:40,712
on an intellectual level,
of course...

1445
01:06:40,790 --> 01:06:42,223
went down to the club...

1446
01:06:42,291 --> 01:06:45,192
drank a little Armadil,
and kicked it with my crew.

1447
01:06:52,268 --> 01:06:56,261
Nicole Wray,
look how cute you are.

1448
01:06:56,338 --> 01:06:58,568
What do I gotta do
to get you to sing for me?

1449
01:06:58,641 --> 01:07:01,109
I'll sing
a little later, a'ight?

1450
01:07:01,177 --> 01:07:03,008
I'll get back at you.

1451
01:07:07,450 --> 01:07:08,678
Why don't y'all get a drink?

1452
01:07:08,751 --> 01:07:09,945
I'll be over there in a minute.

1453
01:07:10,019 --> 01:07:11,008
I'm gonna go talk to my crew.

1454
01:07:11,087 --> 01:07:12,281
All right.

1455
01:07:19,295 --> 01:07:21,126
Don't touch me in public.

1456
01:07:21,197 --> 01:07:23,495
You know, lately,
I been buggin' out.

1457
01:07:23,566 --> 01:07:26,592
You know, all I can think about
is getting money.

1458
01:07:26,669 --> 01:07:29,763
I mean, I think
I gotta see my therapist.

1459
01:07:29,839 --> 01:07:32,967
At first, I wanted
to be a millionaire...

1460
01:07:33,042 --> 01:07:35,203
and I did that 10 years ago.

1461
01:07:35,277 --> 01:07:37,472
Then I felt like
I wanted to be a billionaire...

1462
01:07:37,546 --> 01:07:39,275
and I could see the light...

1463
01:07:39,348 --> 01:07:42,249
but now I think I want to be
a quarter of a trillionaire.

1464
01:07:42,318 --> 01:07:44,286
You know what that is?

1465
01:07:44,353 --> 01:07:47,083
That's $250 billion.

1466
01:07:47,156 --> 01:07:48,885
I'm sittin' at the table...

1467
01:07:48,958 --> 01:07:50,949
kickin' it with my crew,
talking about the only thing...

1468
01:07:51,026 --> 01:07:54,325
interesting more than myself,
which, of course, be my money...

1469
01:07:54,396 --> 01:07:56,125
and my international quest
for greatness...

1470
01:07:56,198 --> 01:07:57,722
but sometimes
when I start talking about...

1471
01:07:57,800 --> 01:08:00,860
myself and my money,
my mind starts to wander.

1472
01:08:01,437 --> 01:08:02,665
You think I'm cute?

1473
01:08:02,738 --> 01:08:04,069
You're adorable.

1474
01:08:04,140 --> 01:08:05,664
And then
I start doing the math...

1475
01:08:05,741 --> 01:08:07,436
for these series of events
that just happened.

1476
01:08:07,510 --> 01:08:09,808
This shit's
just not making sense.

1477
01:08:09,879 --> 01:08:11,847
Do you mind if I see your feet?

1478
01:08:11,914 --> 01:08:13,711
You can see hers.

1479
01:08:13,782 --> 01:08:15,215
Fuck!

1480
01:08:15,284 --> 01:08:17,309
First, I had
this really important meeting...

1481
01:08:17,386 --> 01:08:19,377
interrupted by some bullshit.

1482
01:08:19,455 --> 01:08:20,547
What?

1483
01:08:20,623 --> 01:08:22,352
Yo, Dame, we got robbed.

1484
01:08:22,424 --> 01:08:25,916
What? What do you mean
we got robbed?

1485
01:08:25,995 --> 01:08:27,587
And they took my money?

1486
01:08:27,663 --> 01:08:28,994
Nah. The work in the bathroom.

1487
01:08:29,064 --> 01:08:31,464
All right.
I'll be down there in a minute.

1488
01:08:32,468 --> 01:08:33,799
Carlos wimped.

1489
01:08:33,869 --> 01:08:35,837
See, the first thing
that was buggin' me out was...

1490
01:08:35,905 --> 01:08:37,896
I don't get robbed.
Trust me.

1491
01:08:37,973 --> 01:08:39,838
Then this guy Loco shows up
outta nowhere...

1492
01:08:39,909 --> 01:08:41,672
talkin' shit like
he's somebody I need to know.

1493
01:08:41,744 --> 01:08:44,076
El Pollo Loco.

1494
01:08:44,146 --> 01:08:45,374
El Pollo Loco?

1495
01:08:45,447 --> 01:08:47,472
El Pollo,
but it's all gravy, dad.

1496
01:08:47,550 --> 01:08:49,780
Whatever.

1497
01:08:49,852 --> 01:08:51,444
The next day his man
comes to my place of business...

1498
01:08:51,520 --> 01:08:53,215
and offers me all kinds of work.

1499
01:08:53,289 --> 01:08:54,551
I give you the work,
know what I mean?

1500
01:08:54,623 --> 01:08:57,217
Was it real?
Should I even consider it?

1501
01:08:57,293 --> 01:08:58,317
I don't know.

1502
01:08:58,394 --> 01:08:59,691
Just let me get this straight.

1503
01:08:59,762 --> 01:09:01,787
I'm gonna send my boys
to pick it up for El Plaga.

1504
01:09:01,864 --> 01:09:02,990
And your man gonna give us
100 of them things...

1505
01:09:03,065 --> 01:09:04,123
at 10,000 a clip?

1506
01:09:04,200 --> 01:09:06,566
Can a kid afford to turn
all this money down?

1507
01:09:06,635 --> 01:09:08,262
I don't think so.

1508
01:09:08,337 --> 01:09:10,066
So I did a think-through.

1509
01:09:10,139 --> 01:09:12,573
I didn't really like the way
the Biggis nigga spoke.

1510
01:09:12,641 --> 01:09:14,632
He was one disrespectful
motherfucker.

1511
01:09:14,710 --> 01:09:15,802
What are you
calling me for today?

1512
01:09:15,878 --> 01:09:16,936
Don't you know
it's Daddy-Daughter Day?

1513
01:09:17,012 --> 01:09:18,240
Meet me at the spot.

1514
01:09:18,314 --> 01:09:20,782
I mean, the 5 A.M. Drop-offs
ain't really my steeze...

1515
01:09:20,849 --> 01:09:22,248
but whatever to that.

1516
01:09:22,318 --> 01:09:24,843
This whole situation is startin'
to fuck with my emotions...

1517
01:09:24,920 --> 01:09:27,218
and y'all know I hate
an emotional roller coaster.

1518
01:09:27,289 --> 01:09:28,620
I put too much money...

1519
01:09:28,691 --> 01:09:30,090
into therapy and
anger management for this shit.

1520
01:09:30,159 --> 01:09:31,421
Real fishy shit is going on.

1521
01:09:31,493 --> 01:09:33,984
I mean, they told me
that if we did that thing...

1522
01:09:34,063 --> 01:09:35,690
you know, that thing
you did for me, Jimmy...

1523
01:09:35,764 --> 01:09:37,061
you and Cam?

1524
01:09:38,100 --> 01:09:39,829
You know,
Jimmy did that thing...

1525
01:09:39,902 --> 01:09:43,269
they'd give me
100 of them things at 10 a pop.

1526
01:09:43,339 --> 01:09:44,670
It sounds
too good to be true...

1527
01:09:44,740 --> 01:09:46,332
but, you know,
I gotta chase that.

1528
01:09:46,408 --> 01:09:47,841
I gotta get that money.

1529
01:09:47,910 --> 01:09:49,605
But they might be
comin' through...

1530
01:09:49,678 --> 01:09:52,977
'cause I don't like
my emotions fucked with.

1531
01:09:53,048 --> 01:09:55,915
So I'm gonna go check them
niggas out.

1532
01:09:55,985 --> 01:09:58,783
Anything look strange,
just fire. Fuck that.

1533
01:09:58,854 --> 01:10:01,379
Remember what we did
with the ABM.

1534
01:10:01,457 --> 01:10:02,651
That was fun.

1535
01:10:02,725 --> 01:10:05,660
So, I just need
y'all to watch my back...

1536
01:10:05,728 --> 01:10:07,753
for a quick second.

1537
01:10:07,830 --> 01:10:12,233
Just watch out. 'Scuse me.

1538
01:10:21,644 --> 01:10:23,271
Shit. I forgot somethin'.

1539
01:10:28,417 --> 01:10:30,544
You know, I really don't mind
if y'all touch me in the club...

1540
01:10:30,619 --> 01:10:32,143
but, you know,
for your own protection...

1541
01:10:32,221 --> 01:10:34,018
you know, girls get jealous,
they want to fight...

1542
01:10:34,089 --> 01:10:35,681
fuck our night up.
Know what I mean?

1543
01:10:35,758 --> 01:10:36,850
Follow me, girls.

1544
01:10:36,925 --> 01:10:38,586
Oh, my God!

1545
01:10:38,661 --> 01:10:42,563
Come on, man.
Some nigga shot my driver?

1546
01:10:42,631 --> 01:10:44,292
I must be on "Punk'd"
or somethin'.

1547
01:10:44,366 --> 01:10:45,492
Nigga shot my driver?

1548
01:10:45,567 --> 01:10:47,865
What kind of sick, demented,
twisted, motherfucker...

1549
01:10:47,936 --> 01:10:49,198
shoots a driver?

1550
01:10:49,271 --> 01:10:51,569
What kind of nigga
shoots a driver?

1551
01:10:51,640 --> 01:10:53,835
I might've been confused before.

1552
01:10:53,909 --> 01:10:56,104
Now I'm confused and pissed.

1553
01:10:56,178 --> 01:10:57,702
Aw, man.

1554
01:10:57,780 --> 01:10:59,873
I been in plenty of beefs
and made lots of enemies...

1555
01:10:59,948 --> 01:11:01,347
Sick motherfuckers
in this world.

1556
01:11:01,417 --> 01:11:03,510
But far as I knew,
there's only one motherfucker...

1557
01:11:03,585 --> 01:11:05,746
that hated me like this.

1558
01:11:05,821 --> 01:11:08,255
Left me a note with it.

1559
01:11:08,324 --> 01:11:09,757
"First of all...

1560
01:11:09,825 --> 01:11:12,225
"I want to apologize for being
out of touch for so long.

1561
01:11:12,294 --> 01:11:15,229
"These past few years of my life
have been real fucked up.

1562
01:11:15,297 --> 01:11:18,027
"But you probably
already know that by now.

1563
01:11:18,100 --> 01:11:19,897
"See, man, fuckin' with you...

1564
01:11:19,968 --> 01:11:22,163
"I lost almost everything.

1565
01:11:22,237 --> 01:11:24,228
"Anyway, I'm sorry I left.

1566
01:11:24,373 --> 01:11:27,206
"For what it's worth,
I think about you every day.

1567
01:11:27,276 --> 01:11:29,676
"All I want to do
is see you die.

1568
01:11:29,745 --> 01:11:31,736
"You can understand that, right?

1569
01:11:31,814 --> 01:11:34,408
"But here's the best part,
so pay attention.

1570
01:11:34,483 --> 01:11:37,782
"'Cause if you're readin' this,
it can only mean one thing.

1571
01:11:37,853 --> 01:11:39,684
"I'm out."

1572
01:11:39,755 --> 01:11:42,519
As soon as I got out,
I called D-Nice.

1573
01:11:42,591 --> 01:11:45,685
Told him to have the whole crew
waitin' for me at the spot.

1574
01:11:45,761 --> 01:11:47,888
We had a lot of shit
to clean up...

1575
01:11:47,963 --> 01:11:49,931
and we had to do it fast.

1576
01:11:49,998 --> 01:11:51,431
But first...

1577
01:11:51,500 --> 01:11:53,593
I had a very important meeting
to take care of.

1578
01:11:53,669 --> 01:11:55,660
- Daddy!
- Hey!

1579
01:11:59,975 --> 01:12:01,442
Where your mommy at?

1580
01:12:08,384 --> 01:12:09,373
Yo, he get out?

1581
01:12:09,451 --> 01:12:12,477
Yeah. He went to go see
his daughter.

1582
01:12:12,554 --> 01:12:16,320
Then gonna see his P.O.,
and then probably get some ass.

1583
01:12:16,392 --> 01:12:20,021
Won't be back for a while, man.

1584
01:12:20,095 --> 01:12:23,258
What time we gonna meet
the hyper funny nigga?

1585
01:12:23,332 --> 01:12:25,630
- Big Boy?
- Baby Boy.

1586
01:12:25,701 --> 01:12:29,728
Yeah. 5 A.M. At the shop.

1587
01:12:33,242 --> 01:12:36,109
You a'ight, man?

1588
01:12:36,178 --> 01:12:38,237
Yeah, I'm all right.

1589
01:12:38,313 --> 01:12:40,645
I know the motherfuckers
better have that bread, though.

1590
01:12:40,716 --> 01:12:41,808
Yeah.

1591
01:12:41,884 --> 01:12:43,010
Tired of sittin' around waitin'.

1592
01:12:43,085 --> 01:12:44,609
I don't know how Biggis does it.

1593
01:12:44,686 --> 01:12:47,814
I'm sittin' here losing sleep
off the money we owe El Plaga...

1594
01:12:47,890 --> 01:12:50,415
and he's playing with
video games.

1595
01:12:50,492 --> 01:12:52,483
It's like nothin' ever
got to Biggis.

1596
01:12:52,561 --> 01:12:54,426
He was always too cool.

1597
01:12:56,131 --> 01:12:58,429
I gotta crawl up out
this motherfucker, boy.

1598
01:12:58,500 --> 01:12:59,694
What you want to get to eat?

1599
01:12:59,768 --> 01:13:01,030
IHOP or some shit like that.

1600
01:13:01,103 --> 01:13:02,593
Y'all want to get some grub?

1601
01:13:02,671 --> 01:13:04,764
At this point,
I didn't give a fuck who I shot.

1602
01:13:04,840 --> 01:13:06,967
I was squattin' outside
Dame's spot...

1603
01:13:07,042 --> 01:13:08,839
waitin' for anybody
to come the fuck out.

1604
01:13:08,911 --> 01:13:11,277
Far as I was concerned, all
them pussies owed me money...

1605
01:13:11,346 --> 01:13:12,472
and whoever came out...

1606
01:13:12,548 --> 01:13:14,812
I was gonna give
them niggas the business.

1607
01:13:14,883 --> 01:13:16,282
I'll kill these motherfuckers.

1608
01:13:19,922 --> 01:13:21,890
What you doin', man?
Chill out, motherfucker.

1609
01:13:21,957 --> 01:13:23,424
Listen, Beans got out, man.

1610
01:13:23,492 --> 01:13:24,789
Man, I don't give a fuck.

1611
01:13:24,860 --> 01:13:26,088
I been sitting there squatting
these pussies the whole time.

1612
01:13:26,161 --> 01:13:27,651
Listen. Cool out, cool out.

1613
01:13:27,729 --> 01:13:29,390
Not in front of the pussies.
Beans is out.

1614
01:13:29,465 --> 01:13:30,796
What?

1615
01:13:30,866 --> 01:13:33,767
He out, man. Come on.
Come on, we out.

1616
01:13:33,836 --> 01:13:35,804
- What the fuck?

1617
01:13:35,871 --> 01:13:37,395
You draw right here.

1618
01:13:47,282 --> 01:13:49,375
Who is it?

1619
01:13:49,451 --> 01:13:50,748
Man, who the fuck is that?

1620
01:13:50,819 --> 01:13:52,116
Man, open the fucking door.

1621
01:13:52,187 --> 01:13:54,712
- Yeah, man.
- Oh, shit. That's Beans, yo.

1622
01:13:54,790 --> 01:13:55,950
A'ight.
I'll call you right back.

1623
01:13:56,024 --> 01:14:00,051
Beans?
Get the fuck out of here.

1624
01:14:00,128 --> 01:14:01,095
What's up?

1625
01:14:01,163 --> 01:14:03,097
- What's up, Baby G?
- Welcome home.

1626
01:14:03,165 --> 01:14:04,154
Welcome home. What's up, man?

1627
01:14:04,233 --> 01:14:06,724
Yeah, yeah, yeah. Whatever.
Sit down, man.

1628
01:14:06,802 --> 01:14:08,633
Sit down.

1629
01:14:10,506 --> 01:14:12,531
God damn.

1630
01:14:12,608 --> 01:14:14,303
What the fuck is y'all doing?

1631
01:14:14,376 --> 01:14:15,968
We gardening, man.

1632
01:14:16,044 --> 01:14:17,238
What the fuck is this?

1633
01:14:17,312 --> 01:14:19,507
Y'all sell weed now?

1634
01:14:19,581 --> 01:14:21,572
Just trying to get back.

1635
01:14:23,318 --> 01:14:25,809
This shit's a fucking zoo.

1636
01:14:25,888 --> 01:14:28,083
Throw that shit away, man.

1637
01:14:28,156 --> 01:14:30,522
Where the fuck
is D-Nice and Baby Boy?

1638
01:14:30,592 --> 01:14:31,889
Man, them niggas
running around reckless.

1639
01:14:31,960 --> 01:14:33,985
Both of them niggas
been drawn on for real.

1640
01:14:34,062 --> 01:14:36,860
Yeah, Baby Boy,
he real, real fucked up.

1641
01:14:36,932 --> 01:14:38,763
D-Nice just went looking
for his lil' ass.

1642
01:14:38,834 --> 01:14:40,426
Supposedly went to Dame club.

1643
01:14:40,502 --> 01:14:42,265
Dame club?

1644
01:14:42,337 --> 01:14:44,271
And that nigga Loco
keep calling on some shit.

1645
01:14:44,339 --> 01:14:45,567
We supposed to meet him at 5:00.

1646
01:14:45,641 --> 01:14:47,541
I don't know what's up.

1647
01:14:47,609 --> 01:14:50,077
Y'all niggas is crazy, man.

1648
01:14:50,145 --> 01:14:52,841
This shit fuckin' nasty
in here, man.

1649
01:14:52,915 --> 01:14:55,679
Like a real fucking crack house.

1650
01:14:59,588 --> 01:15:01,385
What the fuck is this?

1651
01:15:01,456 --> 01:15:02,650
That's the work.

1652
01:15:02,724 --> 01:15:03,952
The work?

1653
01:15:04,026 --> 01:15:06,119
Your boy Pollo put us
on the job.

1654
01:15:06,194 --> 01:15:08,754
We robbed the niggas, and
they got us selling the shit.

1655
01:15:08,830 --> 01:15:10,297
We thought you sent work.

1656
01:15:10,365 --> 01:15:12,833
Pollo?

1657
01:15:12,901 --> 01:15:15,734
And then it all started
to make sense.

1658
01:15:15,804 --> 01:15:18,364
El Plaga was right about
Philly's untapped potential.

1659
01:15:18,440 --> 01:15:21,637
Loco was setting me up
from day one.

1660
01:15:21,710 --> 01:15:23,371
Shut that motherfucker
down like it's a virus.

1661
01:15:23,445 --> 01:15:25,413
He was playing me
like a PS-2.

1662
01:15:25,480 --> 01:15:27,414
I think we could do something
to work that out.

1663
01:15:27,482 --> 01:15:28,449
Yeah?

1664
01:15:28,517 --> 01:15:30,382
I told you,
El Plaga ain't no joke.

1665
01:15:30,452 --> 01:15:31,510
Loco?

1666
01:15:31,587 --> 01:15:33,214
Loco. Pollo.
Whatever the fuck...

1667
01:15:33,288 --> 01:15:35,085
- Papi, man.
- Papi.

1668
01:15:35,157 --> 01:15:37,352
You see this shit?

1669
01:15:37,426 --> 01:15:39,656
Do you know what this is,
this Umbrella shit?

1670
01:15:39,728 --> 01:15:41,423
What is it?

1671
01:15:41,496 --> 01:15:44,329
This is Dame's shit, man.
This Dame's work.

1672
01:15:44,399 --> 01:15:46,264
- Dame?
- Dame?

1673
01:15:46,335 --> 01:15:48,895
Y'all don't even know
who the fuck y'all robbin', man.

1674
01:15:48,971 --> 01:15:51,531
Y'all niggas
is fucking crazy, man.

1675
01:15:51,607 --> 01:15:53,438
Y'all thought I simple.

1676
01:15:53,508 --> 01:15:55,703
Get Baby Boy on the phone, man.

1677
01:15:56,979 --> 01:15:58,469
Matter of fact,
give me the phone.

1678
01:15:58,547 --> 01:15:59,571
I'll call him.

1679
01:16:05,354 --> 01:16:07,254
This shit...

1680
01:16:13,128 --> 01:16:14,789
I'm Baby Boy.

1681
01:16:16,465 --> 01:16:19,400
This nigga need to answer
the fuckin' phone.

1682
01:16:22,070 --> 01:16:23,970
Give me your gun, man.

1683
01:16:24,039 --> 01:16:25,597
I'm gonna go get
this fucking nigga, man.

1684
01:16:25,674 --> 01:16:28,199
Somebody kill this nigga.

1685
01:16:29,344 --> 01:16:31,904
Yo, clean this shit
the fuck up, too, man.

1686
01:16:31,980 --> 01:16:34,380
All this shit.

1687
01:16:35,884 --> 01:16:40,344
It feel real good
to come home to, man.

1688
01:16:40,422 --> 01:16:43,289
Motherfuckers is triflin'.

1689
01:16:59,207 --> 01:17:00,970
Close that fucking door.

1690
01:17:01,043 --> 01:17:02,476
Close it.

1691
01:17:03,712 --> 01:17:06,613
You know, you
a disrespectful motherfucker.

1692
01:17:06,682 --> 01:17:07,944
Don't you know
you fucked my night up?

1693
01:17:08,016 --> 01:17:09,449
I had three bitches with me.

1694
01:17:09,518 --> 01:17:11,008
You think I'm scared
of that husky shit?

1695
01:17:11,086 --> 01:17:13,145
The only thing stopping me from
blowing your fucking brains out

1696
01:17:13,221 --> 01:17:14,620
is my anger management.

1697
01:17:14,690 --> 01:17:16,021
I mean,
you come home from jail...

1698
01:17:16,091 --> 01:17:18,423
and the first thing you do
is fucking kill my driver?

1699
01:17:20,362 --> 01:17:21,454
Man, what the fuck
is you talking about...

1700
01:17:21,530 --> 01:17:22,690
kill your driver?

1701
01:17:22,764 --> 01:17:25,494
Nigga, I ain't kill
your fuckin' driver.

1702
01:17:25,567 --> 01:17:27,865
Yeah, and I guess you got
your punk ass man Baby Boy...

1703
01:17:27,936 --> 01:17:29,164

1704
01:17:29,237 --> 01:17:30,204
Yo, Dame, we got robbed.

1705
01:17:30,272 --> 01:17:31,239
They took my money?

1706
01:17:31,306 --> 01:17:32,568
Nah, the work in the bathroom.

1707
01:17:32,641 --> 01:17:35,337
You left a fucking note, genius.

1708
01:17:44,986 --> 01:17:47,318
Man, I ain't write
this fucking letter, man.

1709
01:17:47,389 --> 01:17:48,856
Is you crazy?

1710
01:17:48,924 --> 01:17:50,516
Yeah, Baby Boy robbed you...

1711
01:17:50,592 --> 01:17:53,060
but he ain't know who the fuck
he was robbing, man.

1712
01:17:53,128 --> 01:17:56,154
All he was doing what
the nigga Loco told him to do.

1713
01:17:56,231 --> 01:17:58,324
Yeah, you probably
never heard of Loco...

1714
01:17:58,400 --> 01:17:59,924
but you heard of
El Plaga, right?

1715
01:18:00,001 --> 01:18:01,764
Yeah, I heard of El Plaga.

1716
01:18:01,837 --> 01:18:03,099
Supposed to meet him at 5:00.

1717
01:18:03,171 --> 01:18:07,073
Yeah, well, Loco and El Plaga's
the same motherfucker.

1718
01:18:13,949 --> 01:18:15,917
I mean, I ain't know
it was y'all we went to rob...

1719
01:18:15,984 --> 01:18:17,576
but I was happy
when I found out.

1720
01:18:17,652 --> 01:18:20,985
See, what you ain't know was
when you was robbing us...

1721
01:18:21,056 --> 01:18:23,183
you was taking
your own fucking money.

1722
01:18:23,258 --> 01:18:25,488
I bet you your man
El Plaga told you...

1723
01:18:25,560 --> 01:18:26,925
you'd do a favor for him...

1724
01:18:26,995 --> 01:18:30,692
and he'd do
a favor for you, right?

1725
01:18:30,766 --> 01:18:33,098
They got somethin'
that belong to El Plaga.

1726
01:18:33,168 --> 01:18:35,193
You get it back,
I give you other work.

1727
01:18:35,270 --> 01:18:36,703

1728
01:18:36,772 --> 01:18:39,104
Well, let me

He trying to get both of us
to take each other out.

1731
01:18:48,784 --> 01:18:50,251
Don't do it to yourself, "B."

1732
01:18:50,318 --> 01:18:53,879
Nigga, calm the fuck down.

1733
01:18:55,624 --> 01:18:58,616
Yo, Baby Boy and D-Nice

1734
01:18:58,693 --> 01:19:00,024
Yeah, all right.

1735
01:19:00,095 --> 01:19:02,154
Hurry up off the phone.
My arm's getting tired, man.

1736
01:19:02,230 --> 01:19:04,357
You might have
to come and calm him down.

1737
01:19:04,432 --> 01:19:05,956
Yeah, I'll be there in a minute.

1738
01:19:06,034 --> 01:19:07,092
All right.

1739
01:19:09,337 --> 01:19:11,601
Man, do what you want to do.

1740
01:19:11,673 --> 01:19:16,542
I got a meeting with Loco
or El Plaga at 5:00.

1741
01:19:16,611 --> 01:19:18,772
I guess I'll see you there...

1742
01:19:20,882 --> 01:19:22,110
genius.

1743
01:19:31,493 --> 01:19:35,293
By the way, I could've blew
your fuckin' head off.

1744
01:19:37,799 --> 01:19:40,996
How the fuck I'm gonna get home?
I ain't got no driver.

1745
01:20:02,858 --> 01:20:05,952
Yo, put the drinks down, man.

1746
01:20:06,027 --> 01:20:08,461
It's about that time.
Y'all ready?

1747
01:20:08,530 --> 01:20:11,124
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

1748
01:20:11,199 --> 01:20:14,532
Get y'all guns, man.
Meet me in the car in 5 minutes.

1749
01:20:14,603 --> 01:20:17,003
Bring extra clips, too.

1750
01:20:19,908 --> 01:20:21,967
You don't talk about it.

1751
01:20:22,043 --> 01:20:24,170
You don't plan for it.

1752
01:20:24,246 --> 01:20:26,544
You just tell your crew
to strap up...

1753
01:20:26,615 --> 01:20:28,173
and it's on.

1754
01:20:31,853 --> 01:20:33,787
You just tell your crew
it's on...

1755
01:20:33,855 --> 01:20:35,083
and it's on.

1756
01:20:35,156 --> 01:20:37,647
- What's up, y'all?
- What's up?

1757
01:20:37,726 --> 01:20:39,921
I need y'all to take a ride
with me down to the botanica.

1758
01:20:39,995 --> 01:20:43,021
Meet me in the van
in five minutes.

1759
01:20:43,098 --> 01:20:45,862
Oh, yeah. Bring your guns.

1760
01:20:56,578 --> 01:20:59,741
Yo! Yo, what time is it, yo?

1761
01:21:01,283 --> 01:21:02,545
Oh, shit.

1762
01:21:02,617 --> 01:21:03,948
5:30.

1763
01:21:04,019 --> 01:21:06,544
Yo, slime,
this is some bullshit, yo.

1764
01:21:06,621 --> 01:21:08,612
Baby Boy was supposed
to meet me at 5:00...

1765
01:21:08,690 --> 01:21:11,591
and me and my niggas
is real impatient.

1766
01:21:11,660 --> 01:21:14,322
Another five minutes,
and we gonna go get his ass.

1767
01:21:14,396 --> 01:21:16,364
Whose fucking car is that?

1768
01:21:18,600 --> 01:21:21,091
Loco, stay here,
stay here, stay here!

1769
01:21:21,169 --> 01:21:22,761
Fuck that.

1770
01:21:28,810 --> 01:21:32,302
Before I knew it,
the whole ABM crew was there.

1771
01:21:32,380 --> 01:21:34,678
Everybody...
they was all buggin'.

1772
01:21:34,749 --> 01:21:35,807
Bullets everywhere.

1773
01:21:35,884 --> 01:21:38,409
We shoot, they shoot.
They shoot, we shoot.

1774
01:21:38,486 --> 01:21:39,851
Fucking bananas.

1775
01:21:40,956 --> 01:21:43,015
Hey, what the fuck
you doin', Beans?!

1776
01:21:43,091 --> 01:21:44,558
To make shit fouler,
out of nowhere...

1777
01:21:44,626 --> 01:21:47,686
the Dame dude pops up
with a truck full of niggas.

1778
01:21:47,762 --> 01:21:50,754
Niggas standing there
side by side...

1779
01:21:50,832 --> 01:21:51,958
arch enemies.

1780
01:21:52,033 --> 01:21:55,298
Beans, I could blow
your fucking head off right now.

1781
01:21:55,370 --> 01:21:57,065
You do know this, don't you?

1782
01:21:58,606 --> 01:22:00,904
Yeah, all right, nigga.
I wish you would.

1783
01:22:00,976 --> 01:22:02,967
I'm going to take care
of this Loco motherfucker...

1784
01:22:03,044 --> 01:22:05,569
then we'll see what's up.

1785
01:22:06,815 --> 01:22:07,782
Aw!

1786
01:22:07,849 --> 01:22:08,873
Aw, shit, man. You hit, man.

1787
01:22:08,950 --> 01:22:10,508
Come on, we got to get
the fuck up outta here.

1788
01:22:10,585 --> 01:22:12,951
Come on.

1789
01:22:15,557 --> 01:22:18,856
Shot after shot,
clip after clip...

1790
01:22:18,927 --> 01:22:20,690
and not a cop in sight.

1791
01:22:20,762 --> 01:22:23,458
This shit
makes no fucking sense.

1792
01:22:31,539 --> 01:22:34,030
Yo. Put him in the car...

1793
01:22:34,109 --> 01:22:35,576
and meet me around the corner
in five minutes.

1794
01:22:35,643 --> 01:22:38,271
He gonna be all right.
It's a flesh wound.

1795
01:22:41,483 --> 01:22:42,882
You knew
I could've had you, right?

1796
01:22:42,951 --> 01:22:43,918
You couldn't have had shit.

1797
01:22:43,985 --> 01:22:45,247
Yeah, I could've had you.

1798
01:22:45,320 --> 01:22:46,446
Fuck!

1799
01:22:50,692 --> 01:22:51,852
Beans, what the fuck, nigga?

1800
01:22:51,926 --> 01:22:54,190
You shootin' at me?!
You're a maniac!

1801
01:22:54,262 --> 01:22:57,060
Then why the fuck you set me up
all this time, man?

1802
01:22:57,132 --> 01:22:59,362
- You fucking snake!
- Who the snake?

1803
01:22:59,434 --> 01:23:02,597
What the fuck type nigga
I look like settin' you up?

1804
01:23:02,670 --> 01:23:04,262
Nigga, if you wanted
to see me, nigga...

1805
01:23:04,339 --> 01:23:05,601
you could've seen me in jail!

1806
01:23:05,673 --> 01:23:08,198
No way!
If I wanted to see you...

1807
01:23:08,276 --> 01:23:09,971
I would've got you in jail,
nigga!

1808
01:23:10,045 --> 01:23:11,512
I'd be there like you!

1809
01:23:11,579 --> 01:23:13,547
Instead of
fucking passing it to you!

1810
01:23:13,615 --> 01:23:16,778
Nigga, you ain't gangsta, nigga!
You's a bitch!

1811
01:23:16,851 --> 01:23:18,284
Nigga, I was born gangsta...

1812
01:23:18,353 --> 01:23:20,287
and you set me the fuck up, man.

1813
01:23:20,355 --> 01:23:21,617
El Plaga!

1814
01:23:21,689 --> 01:23:23,281
That's El Plaga?

1815
01:23:24,459 --> 01:23:26,893
I ain't fucking El Plaga, nigga!

1816
01:23:26,961 --> 01:23:29,555
I know there ain't
no fucking El Plaga, man.

1817
01:23:29,631 --> 01:23:31,656
You don't think
I know who work we robbed...

1818
01:23:31,733 --> 01:23:33,894
the nigga ass Umbrella?

1819
01:23:33,968 --> 01:23:37,062
You got us going at each other
so you can take over, huh?

1820
01:23:38,540 --> 01:23:40,474
They thought I was El Plaga?

1821
01:23:40,542 --> 01:23:42,703
I never even met El Plaga.

1822
01:23:42,777 --> 01:23:44,210
Well, what them niggas
talking about?

1823
01:23:44,279 --> 01:23:47,009
Unless he was always around
the whole fucking time.

1824
01:23:47,082 --> 01:23:48,674
Yo, Papi, dead that shit, man.

1825
01:23:48,750 --> 01:23:49,717
Who work was it, yo?

1826
01:23:49,784 --> 01:23:50,773
Who work was it?

1827
01:23:50,852 --> 01:23:52,251
Who you think hooked up
you and Beans?

1828
01:23:52,320 --> 01:23:53,651
You wanted a connect in Philly?

1829
01:23:53,721 --> 01:23:56,189
At that moment, in-between
bullets flying past my melon...

1830
01:23:56,257 --> 01:23:58,122
I started to see
the whole picture.

1831
01:23:58,393 --> 01:24:00,759
It was Biggis. It had to be.

1832
01:24:00,829 --> 01:24:03,229
He was pulling the strings
since I was locked up.

1833
01:24:03,298 --> 01:24:05,027
He probably got
me and Beans together...

1834
01:24:05,100 --> 01:24:06,397
in the first place.

1835
01:24:07,435 --> 01:24:08,595
He planned it from day one.

1836
01:24:08,670 --> 01:24:11,605
The motherfucker set
that shit up from the inside.

1837
01:24:11,673 --> 01:24:13,664
I need you to do me
another favor.

1838
01:24:13,741 --> 01:24:14,708
It's for a friend of mine.

1839
01:24:14,776 --> 01:24:16,710
You heard of El Plaga, right?

1840
01:24:17,946 --> 01:24:21,177
They call him Beans.
You know him?

1841
01:24:21,249 --> 01:24:23,149
Fuck him. Whatever you need.

1842
01:24:23,218 --> 01:24:24,879
Good.

1843
01:24:24,953 --> 01:24:26,716
Here's what I need you to do.

1844
01:24:27,956 --> 01:24:31,448
Yeah. Biggis was slick.
Fucking devious.

1845
01:24:31,526 --> 01:24:34,689
Tell your boy if his guy
does that thing...

1846
01:24:34,762 --> 01:24:35,956
we'll have him out
by the end of the month.

1847
01:24:36,030 --> 01:24:38,055
All right, then.
I'm going to let Salaam know.

1848
01:24:38,133 --> 01:24:39,430
I'm sure he'll be happy.

1849
01:24:39,501 --> 01:24:41,128
Ever since
I got out the "P" now...

1850
01:24:41,202 --> 01:24:43,762
Biggis has been trying
to get me to start a war.

1851
01:24:43,838 --> 01:24:45,567
With Beans and Dame
out of the game...

1852
01:24:45,640 --> 01:24:48,074
he could take over
the whole fucking city.

1853
01:24:52,347 --> 01:24:54,315
It's not just me he was using...

1854
01:24:54,382 --> 01:24:56,077
Beans and Dame, too...

1855
01:24:56,151 --> 01:24:58,949
playing us all.

1856
01:24:59,020 --> 01:25:01,648
Biggis always said there was
a lot of work in Philly.

1857
01:25:01,723 --> 01:25:03,714
Who fucking work was it, yo?

1858
01:25:03,791 --> 01:25:05,224
They gonna come to me...

1859
01:25:05,293 --> 01:25:07,420
with some Dame
and Umbrella type of shit?

1860
01:25:07,495 --> 01:25:10,055
Fuck that, nigga. I raised you.

1861
01:25:10,131 --> 01:25:11,393
You're like my son.

1862
01:25:15,370 --> 01:25:17,668
I never told him
about the Umbrella...

1863
01:25:17,739 --> 01:25:20,139
and I never knew the drugs
at the burger spot...

1864
01:25:20,208 --> 01:25:21,505
belonged to Dame.

1865
01:25:21,576 --> 01:25:23,544
Biggis told me
it was El Plaga's shit...

1866
01:25:23,611 --> 01:25:25,374
and we were taking it back.

1867
01:25:25,446 --> 01:25:27,846
How far back did this shit go?

1868
01:25:27,916 --> 01:25:29,679
Was it at the botanica
with Freeway?

1869
01:25:29,751 --> 01:25:31,218
Let me get this straight.

1870
01:25:31,286 --> 01:25:33,811
The drugs are in the statue?

1871
01:25:35,323 --> 01:25:36,688
What the fuck I just say, dawg?

1872
01:25:36,758 --> 01:25:37,952
Don't worry about it.

1873
01:25:38,026 --> 01:25:40,824
Did this shit start on my easy
with the Tuesday bitch?

1874
01:25:40,895 --> 01:25:43,989
Have fun in prison,
you stupid motherfucker.

1875
01:25:46,134 --> 01:25:48,227
You happy? I said it.

1876
01:25:48,303 --> 01:25:49,895
Shut the fuck up.

1877
01:25:49,971 --> 01:25:52,838
Does this shit go back
even further than that?

1878
01:25:56,844 --> 01:26:00,336
He was using me
my whole fucking life.

1879
01:26:12,894 --> 01:26:14,862
El Plaga.

1880
01:26:21,703 --> 01:26:23,295
You hear that?

1881
01:26:23,371 --> 01:26:24,463
You hear that?

1882
01:26:24,539 --> 01:26:25,972
I think we should get
the fuck out of here.

1883
01:26:26,040 --> 01:26:28,770
I ain't waiting here, man.

1884
01:26:28,843 --> 01:26:30,936
Can you give me
a lift to my car?

1885
01:26:31,012 --> 01:26:33,139
I'm kind of around the corner.

1886
01:26:38,620 --> 01:26:40,679
They should pull up any second.
We wait right here.

1887
01:26:40,755 --> 01:26:41,881
All right.

1888
01:26:45,693 --> 01:26:46,819
Holler at me, man.

1889
01:26:46,894 --> 01:26:47,986

Dame and them?

1896
01:26:57,171 --> 01:26:58,297
Man, that shit was crazy, man.

He in the car with me,

1902
01:27:06,914 --> 01:27:08,814
Man, let me speak

1903
01:27:08,883 --> 01:27:10,680
Yo, say something to my man.

1904
01:27:10,752 --> 01:27:12,117
Tell him I said, "What's up?"

1905
01:27:13,421 --> 01:27:14,854
Man, you's a funny nigga, bull.

1907
01:27:16,658 --> 01:27:17,852
For real, though?

01:27:17,925 --> 01:27:19,552
Yeah, everything's good.

1909
01:27:19,627 --> 01:27:21,822
- Hey, you know what?

1910
01:27:21,896 --> 01:27:23,955
I'm thinking

1911
01:27:24,032 --> 01:27:25,966

Yeah, an extravaganza.
Bananas.

1913
01:27:28,069 --> 01:27:30,037
Straight up.

1914
01:27:30,104 --> 01:27:33,096
We should throw him
a surprise party.

1915
01:27:40,014 --> 01:27:41,948
They going to do a number...

They showed

1917
01:27:48,089 --> 01:27:49,420
This is my personal...

1918
01:27:49,490 --> 01:27:50,650
Hello?

1919
01:27:53,795 --> 01:27:55,092
Motherfucker,

1920
01:27:56,397 --> 01:27:58,058
Don't stop and talk
to no boys, OK?

1921
01:28:01,135 --> 01:28:02,329
Be good, all right?

1922
01:28:07,508 --> 01:28:09,305
Now, what should I do

1923
01:28:09,377 --> 01:28:12,141
Now, what should I do

1924
01:28:12,213 --> 01:28:14,647
Now, what should I do with
y'all little greasy asses?

1925
01:28:20,088 --> 01:28:21,180
Go crazy.

1926
01:28:25,293 --> 01:28:27,921
I ain't supposed to be laughing.

1927
01:28:27,995 --> 01:28:29,622
I don't even understand

1928
01:28:40,041 --> 01:28:41,440
Shit like that.

1929

Yeah, baby doll.

1930
01:28:45,780 --> 01:28:48,408
From the heart... la corazon.

1931
01:28:56,190 --> 01:28:57,282
Yo, Fanlan.

1932
01:28:57,358 --> 01:28:59,326
Yeah. Yeah, hold on, man.

1933
01:29:02,397 --> 01:29:04,228
Hold on. Stop everything.
I forgot.

1934
01:29:04,298 --> 01:29:05,390
What are we doing again?

1935
01:29:17,712 --> 01:29:19,304
Here's your chips, baby!
Yeah!

1936
01:29:30,491 --> 01:29:32,186
Oh, no.

1937
01:29:36,297 --> 01:29:37,662
Sorry. Cut.

1938
01:29:37,732 --> 01:29:40,200
Do both of us or just Juelz?
I'm sorry.

1939
01:29:54,916 --> 01:29:56,611
He'll knock you the fuck out.

1940
01:29:59,687 --> 01:30:00,711
Cut.
