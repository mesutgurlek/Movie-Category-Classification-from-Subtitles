1
00:05:39,924 --> 00:05:43,260
WHY DO THEY ALWAYS
SOUND SO MANY TRUMPETS?

2
00:05:43,344 --> 00:05:44,678
I'M NOT JEHOVAH.

3
00:05:46,430 --> 00:05:49,099
WHY CAN'T A PRINCE
COME HOME WITHOUT A FUSS?

4
00:05:49,183 --> 00:05:52,603
PRESUMABLY BECAUSE
HE IS A PRINCE, SIR.

5
00:05:52,645 --> 00:05:54,480
OTHER PEOPLE CAN SNEAK IN
THE BACK WAY UNANNOUNCED,

6
00:05:54,605 --> 00:05:56,857
WHICH IS HOW
IT SHOULD BE.

7
00:05:56,941 --> 00:05:58,108
WHAT ARE YOU
SMILING AT?

8
00:05:58,192 --> 00:05:59,860
OH, WAS
I SMILING, SIR?

9
00:05:59,902 --> 00:06:02,863
JUST THE SUDDEN WARMTH
CRACKING MY FACE.

10
00:06:07,409 --> 00:06:11,330
A PRINCE'S LOT IS
NOTHING MORE THAN A BORE.

11
00:06:11,413 --> 00:06:14,124
YOUR FACE CRACKS
RATHER EASILY, DOESN'T IT?

12
00:06:14,166 --> 00:06:15,417
NOW, YOU MARK
MY WORDS,

13
00:06:15,501 --> 00:06:16,835
BEFORE YOU
CAN COUNT TO 10,

14
00:06:16,877 --> 00:06:19,046
THROUGH THAT DOOR,
WITH THE ODIOUS PUNCTUALITY

15
00:06:19,129 --> 00:06:20,506
OF OUR NEIGHBOR'S
MUCH VAUNTED,

16
00:06:20,589 --> 00:06:23,050
RECENTLY INVENTED, HIDEOUSLY
IRRITATING CUCKOO CLOCK,

17
00:06:23,133 --> 00:06:25,177
WILL COME OUR DEAR
AND LOYAL SUBJECT,

18
00:06:25,219 --> 00:06:28,264
THE EVER-UNCTUOUS
LORD HIGH CHAMBERLAIN.

19
00:06:28,305 --> 00:06:30,432
5, 6...

20
00:06:30,474 --> 00:06:32,893
Man: 7!

21
00:06:32,977 --> 00:06:34,228
HE'S IMPROVING.

22
00:06:34,270 --> 00:06:36,230
ONE OF THESE DAYS,
HE'S GOING TO ACHIEVE

23
00:06:36,313 --> 00:06:37,731
THE ELUSIVE
10-MINUTE MILE.

24
00:06:37,815 --> 00:06:38,774
HA HA HA HA!

25
00:06:38,816 --> 00:06:45,072
YOUR ROYAL HIGHNESS.
AH, WELCOME HOME.

26
00:06:45,114 --> 00:06:47,783
WELCOME HOME,
YOUR ROYAL HIGHNESS.

27
00:06:47,866 --> 00:06:49,785
MY LORD HIGH CHAMBERLAIN,

28
00:06:49,827 --> 00:06:51,370
WHAT AN UNEXPECTED
PLEASURE.

29
00:06:51,453 --> 00:06:52,413
I AM COMMANDED BY

30
00:06:52,496 --> 00:06:54,415
HIS MAJESTY THE KING,
YOUR FATHER,

31
00:06:54,498 --> 00:06:56,417
AND HER MAJESTY
THE QUEEN, YOUR MOTHER--

32
00:06:56,500 --> 00:06:57,668
YES, YES, NOW,
DON'T TIRE YOURSELF,

33
00:06:57,710 --> 00:06:59,044
I AM ACQUAINTED
WITH THEM.

34
00:06:59,086 --> 00:07:00,671
HOW ARE MY
DOTING PARENTS?

35
00:07:00,754 --> 00:07:03,507
THEIR MAJESTIES ARE NATURALLY
MOST ANXIOUS TO HEAR

36
00:07:03,549 --> 00:07:05,759
SUCH GLAD TIDINGS
I FEEL SURE YOU BEAR

37
00:07:05,801 --> 00:07:08,220
CONCERNING YOUR RECENT
ABSENCE FROM THE COURT.

38
00:07:08,304 --> 00:07:10,889
NAMELY, THE MATTER
OF YOUR ACCEPTANCE OF

39
00:07:10,931 --> 00:07:14,184
AND BETROTHAL TO THE PRINCESS
SELINA OF CAROLSFELD.

40
00:07:14,226 --> 00:07:18,105
INDEED, IN ANTICIPATION
OF SUCH WONDERFUL NEWS,

41
00:07:18,188 --> 00:07:20,190
HIS MAJESTY THE KING
HAS DECIDED TO MAKE YOU

42
00:07:20,232 --> 00:07:22,401
A KNIGHT GRAND CROSS

43
00:07:22,484 --> 00:07:25,863
OF THE MOST ILLUSTRIOUS ORDER
OF SAINT DAVID THE MARTYR.

44
00:07:25,904 --> 00:07:28,198
WHICH IS USUALLY
AWARDED POSTHUMOUSLY.

45
00:07:28,282 --> 00:07:30,117
A SUITABLE HONOR,
AS IT HAPPENS,

46
00:07:30,200 --> 00:07:33,495
FOR THE MATTER OF MY BETROTHAL
IS VERY STATUS QUO.

47
00:07:33,537 --> 00:07:35,956
I DID NOT FIND THE LADY OF
YOUR CHOICE TO BE MY CHOICE.

48
00:07:36,040 --> 00:07:38,125
OH, BUT, SIR--
WE ARE RETURNED...

49
00:07:38,208 --> 00:07:39,877
AS WE DEPARTED.

50
00:07:39,960 --> 00:07:42,212
THE KING I'M SURE,
AND INDEED MY DEAR MAMA

51
00:07:42,254 --> 00:07:43,923
WILL SHARE
YOUR NOTICEABLE GRIEF.

52
00:07:44,006 --> 00:07:46,342
Chamberlain: INDEED, SIR,
THE WHOLE COURT WILL BE GRIEVED.

53
00:07:46,383 --> 00:07:47,676
WELL, SO BE IT.

54
00:07:47,718 --> 00:07:51,305
ANY SIMPLE PEASANT IS
AFFORDED THE ABILITY

55
00:07:51,388 --> 00:07:55,267
IN LOVE...
TO WIN OR LOSE

56
00:07:55,309 --> 00:07:59,563
WHILE I OF THE NOBILITY
AM ROBBED OF THE FACILITY

57
00:07:59,605 --> 00:08:02,024
TO CHOOSE

58
00:08:03,567 --> 00:08:07,363
ANY SERF OR SERVANT
CAN BY NATURAL SELECTION

59
00:08:07,404 --> 00:08:11,200
ELECT HIMSELF A MATE
IF SHE'S AMENABLE

60
00:08:11,241 --> 00:08:15,204
BUT DUE TO MY HIGH BREEDING,
I'M CONTINUALLY ACCEDING

61
00:08:15,245 --> 00:08:18,249
TO DEMANDS
I FIND INCREASINGLY

62
00:08:18,290 --> 00:08:20,542
UNTENABLE

63
00:08:20,584 --> 00:08:23,879
ALL I ASK, AND IT'S A
SIMPLE ENOUGH REQUEST--

64
00:08:23,963 --> 00:08:25,923
WELL, FOLLOW ME,
BY ALL MEANS, FOLLOW ME.

65
00:08:28,759 --> 00:08:32,346
I WISH TO KNOW,
I DEMAND TO KNOW...

66
00:08:32,429 --> 00:08:36,225
WHY CAN'T I BE
TWO PEOPLE?

67
00:08:36,267 --> 00:08:40,521
WHY CAN'T I LIVE
TWO ROLES?

68
00:08:40,604 --> 00:08:44,900
WHY CAN'T ONE OF ME PERFORM
ALL THE CLOYING AMENITIES TI

69
00:08:44,942 --> 00:08:46,735
WHILE THE OTHER ME,
TWIN BROTHER ME

70
00:08:46,777 --> 00:08:48,612
BE A FREE AND HAPPY SOUL?</>

71
00:08:48,696 --> 00:08:52,408
WHY CAN'T I BE
TWO PEOPLE?

72
00:08:52,449 --> 00:08:56,453
SPLIT MYSELF RIGHT IN HALF

73
00:08:56,495 --> 00:08:58,914
THEN I COULD SATISFY
AND MOLLIFY

74
00:08:58,956 --> 00:09:02,126
AND PACIFY AND QUALIFY

75
00:09:02,167 --> 00:09:04,336
WHILE THE OTHER ME
WOULD HAVE

76
00:09:04,420 --> 00:09:07,006
A HELL OF
A HEALTHY LAUGH, HA? '11

77
00:09:10,467 --> 00:09:14,179
THE CUSTOM OF ROYALTY
IN REFERRING TO ONESELF

78
00:09:14,221 --> 00:09:18,642
IS TO NATURALLY EMPLOY
THE ROYAL "WE“

79
00:09:18,726 --> 00:09:20,477
"WE ARE VERY HAPPY" SI

80
00:09:20,561 --> 00:09:22,646
Y, “WE ARE VERY SAD“ “I

81
00:09:22,688 --> 00:09:26,817
“WE ARE BORED
AND SUFFER FROM ENNUI"

82
00:09:26,859 --> 00:09:30,154
FOR A ROYAL PRINCE,
THERE'S NO SUCH WORD AS “ME"

83
00:09:30,237 --> 00:09:32,781
IT'S ALWAYS "WE“

84
00:09:32,823 --> 00:09:38,329
SO, RIGHTFULLY, I
SHOULD BE TWO on THREE

85
00:09:38,370 --> 00:09:39,496
DON'T YOU AGREE?

86
00:09:39,580 --> 00:09:41,916
IT'S NOT FOR ME TO SAY,
YOUR ROYAL HIGHNESS.

87
00:09:41,999 --> 00:09:43,167
PERHAPS NOT.

88
00:09:43,250 --> 00:09:45,711
SO, I ASK MYSELF...

89
00:09:45,794 --> 00:09:49,632
WHY CAN'T I BE
TWO PEOPLE?

90
00:09:49,673 --> 00:09:53,761
WHY CAN'T I PLAY
TWO PARTS?

91
00:09:53,844 --> 00:09:57,890
WHY CAN'T ONE OF ME ENDURE
THE APPALLING FORMALITIES

92
00:09:57,932 --> 00:10:00,059
WHILE THE OTHER ME,
TWIN BROTHER ME

93
00:10:00,100 --> 00:10:01,852
HAVE A FREE
AND HAPPY HEART?

94
00:10:01,936 --> 00:10:05,606
IF I COULD BE
TWO PEOPLE

95
00:10:05,689 --> 00:10:09,902
LIFE WOULD NOT
PASS ME BY

96
00:10:09,944 --> 00:10:13,447
I'D HAVE A CHANCE
TO PICK AND CHOOSE

97
00:10:13,530 --> 00:10:16,742
I'D HAVE A CHANCE
TO WIN OR LOSE

98
00:10:16,784 --> 00:10:22,539
AND MAYBE ONE OF US
WOULD HAVE A CHANCE TO LIVE...

99
00:10:22,581 --> 00:10:24,416
BEFORE WE DIE!

100
00:10:24,500 --> 00:10:27,586
DIE? WHO'S DIED?

101
00:10:27,670 --> 00:10:31,131
AH! AT LAST!
OUR DEAR SON.

102
00:10:31,215 --> 00:10:34,093
WE ARE... WE ARE...
WE'RE WHAT?

103
00:10:34,134 --> 00:10:35,469
DELIGHTED.

104
00:10:35,552 --> 00:10:39,014
YES, DELIGHTED
TO SEE YOU RETURN.

105
00:10:39,056 --> 00:10:40,057
OH!

106
00:10:40,099 --> 00:10:43,102
AH, YES, I HAVE
SOMETHING FOR YOU.

107
00:10:43,185 --> 00:10:44,812
Prince: FATHER...

108
00:10:44,895 --> 00:10:45,854
Chamberlain:
YOUR MAJESTY--

109
00:10:45,896 --> 00:10:46,855
KNEEL, SIR.

110
00:10:46,897 --> 00:10:48,065
FATHER.

111
00:10:48,148 --> 00:10:51,777
I DO NOT WISH" IT WOULD
BE MOST INAPPROPRIATE...

112
00:10:51,860 --> 00:10:53,696
YOUR MAJESTY, HIS ROYAL
HIGHNESS HAS RETURNED--

113
00:10:53,737 --> 00:10:56,198
OF COURSE HE'S RETURNED! YOU
GET MORE SENILE EVERY DAY.

114
00:10:56,240 --> 00:10:57,283
I HAVE RETURNED,
FATHER--

115
00:10:57,366 --> 00:10:58,284
NOW YOU' RE
CATCHING IT.

116
00:10:58,367 --> 00:10:59,785
EMPTY-HANDED.
KNEEL, SIR.

117
00:10:59,910 --> 00:11:01,036
FATHER, THIS IS
MOST EMIBARRASSING.

118
00:11:01,078 --> 00:11:02,746
I COMMAND YOU
TO KNEEL, SIR!

119
00:11:02,788 --> 00:11:04,415
I DON'T DESERVE IT.
I HAVEN'T EARNED IT.

120
00:11:04,498 --> 00:11:05,708
NOBODY EARNS THIS.

121
00:11:05,791 --> 00:11:07,209
IT'S GIVEN BECAUSE I AM
THE KING AND I LIKE IT.

122
00:11:07,293 --> 00:11:08,335
WHERE'S MY SWORD?

123
00:11:10,254 --> 00:11:11,839
AH! IT'S FAR
TOO HEAVY.

124
00:11:11,922 --> 00:11:13,507
YOU KNOW, I WAS BORN WITH THE
CURSE OF THE WEAK WRISTS.

125
00:11:13,591 --> 00:11:16,635
OH, I DO SO LOVE
A CEREMONY.

126
00:11:16,719 --> 00:11:19,263
AH, THAT'S BETTER.
I DUB THEE--

127
00:11:19,305 --> 00:11:22,349
NOW, WAIT A MINUTE.

128
00:11:22,433 --> 00:11:23,642
SHOULDN'T THERE BE
SOMETHING BEFORE THAT?

129
00:11:23,726 --> 00:11:25,352
YES, INDEED, SIRE.
I HAVE IT HERE.

130
00:11:25,436 --> 00:11:27,980
YOUR MAJESTY--FATHER,
DO WE--MUST I--

131

YOU MUST. AHEM!

OH! A LITTLE
PREMATURE, AM I?

157
00:12:42,179 --> 00:12:45,224
I SAY, HAVE I DROPPED THE
TINIEST OF SOCIAL BRICKETTES?

158
00:12:45,266 --> 00:12:46,976
I MEAN, I WAS BEING
QUITE SINCERE.

159
00:12:47,059 --> 00:12:50,354
WELL, YOU KNOW, AS
SINCERE AS I EVER AM.

160
00:12:50,396 --> 00:12:51,397
OH, no!

161
00:12:51,480 --> 00:12:55,067
WHO IS IT? HAS THERE BEEN
AN UPRISING?

162
00:12:55,109 --> 00:12:57,820
NO, YOUR MAJESTY. IT'S
JUST THE DUKE OF MONTAGUE.

163
00:12:57,861 --> 00:12:59,780
IS HE STILL ALIVE?

164
00:12:59,863 --> 00:13:02,950
I THOUGHT WE BURIED HIM.

165
00:13:03,033 --> 00:13:05,244
FATHER, EVER SINCE
I ENTERED THIS ROOM,

166
00:13:05,286 --> 00:13:06,287
I'VE BEEN TRYING
TO TELL YOU THAT

167
00:13:06,370 --> 00:13:09,748
WHAT YOU EXPECTED OF ME
DID NOT TAKE PLACE.

168
00:13:13,294 --> 00:13:15,212
MY THROW, I THINK.

169
00:13:15,296 --> 00:13:17,881
No, IT'S NOT.
YOU'RE CHEATING AGAIN.

170
00:13:17,923 --> 00:13:20,551
KINGS NEVER CHEAT. THEY
ADAPT TO CIRCUMSTANCES,

171
00:13:20,593 --> 00:13:23,387
BUT THEY NEVER CHEAT.

172
00:13:23,470 --> 00:13:24,555
IF I MAY, SIR,
BY roux LEAVE,

173
00:13:24,638 --> 00:13:26,390
THIS THING
IS CHOKING ME.

174
00:13:26,473 --> 00:13:27,641
YOU SEE HOW
I'M PLACED?

175
00:13:27,725 --> 00:13:29,435
ACCUSED IN FRONT OF THE
COURT BY MY OWN WIFE.

176
00:13:29,476 --> 00:13:30,894
FATHER,
THIS IS SERIOUS.

177
00:13:30,978 --> 00:13:32,396
OF COURSE,
IT' S SERIOUS.

178
00:13:32,479 --> 00:13:34,773
I SHALL PROBABLY
CONCEDE THE GAME.

179
00:13:34,857 --> 00:13:35,983
IT'S A ROYAL PREROGATIVE
TO BE UNSPORTING.

180
00:13:36,066 --> 00:13:38,277
NEVER CONCEDE.

181
00:13:38,319 --> 00:13:40,070
I THROW.

182
00:13:49,079 --> 00:13:50,039
BLACK 5 !

183
00:13:55,794 --> 00:13:58,756
THE MATCH, FATHER, WAS OF
YOUR MAKING NOT OF MINE.

184
00:13:58,839 --> 00:14:00,299
EVEN So,
AS A DUTIFUL SON,

185
00:14:00,382 --> 00:14:01,926
I JOURNEYED FAR
BEYOND OUR BORDERS

186
00:14:01,967 --> 00:14:04,261
TO PAY MY RESPECTS
TO THE LADY AND...

187
00:14:04,303 --> 00:14:05,387
SEE FOR MYSELF.

188
00:14:05,471 --> 00:14:08,182
AND SHE WAS FAIR,
WAS SHE NOT?

189
00:14:08,223 --> 00:14:10,809
INDEED, SIR. PERHAPS
PALE RATHER THAN FAIR.

190
00:14:10,851 --> 00:14:13,270
A SICKLY LADY, SIR,
GIVEN TO MUCH SWOONING

191
00:14:13,312 --> 00:14:14,647
AND... AND VAPORS.

192
00:14:14,730 --> 00:14:16,190
ALL LADIES SWOON. THEY KNOW
IT'S EXPECTED OF THEM.

193
00:14:16,231 --> 00:14:17,524
SOME SWOON
MORE THAN OTHERS, SIR,

194
00:14:17,608 --> 00:14:21,028
AND SWOONING TO EXCESS IS NOT
A QUALITY I GREATLY ADMIRE.

195
00:14:21,070 --> 00:14:24,031
SHE REFUSED YOU? IS THAT
WHAT YOU'RE SAYING?

196
00:14:24,114 --> 00:14:26,283
No, FATHER,
SHE COULD NOT REFUSE ME

197
00:14:26,367 --> 00:14:28,243
BECAUSE I DID NOT OFFER.

198
00:14:28,285 --> 00:14:30,537
YOU PERHAPS PLACED
TOO MUCH TRUST

199
00:14:30,621 --> 00:14:33,290
IN THE PORTRAIT PAINTERS
OF CAROLSFELD.

200
00:14:33,332 --> 00:14:36,919
THE LIKENESS
WAS No LIKENESS.

201
00:14:37,002 --> 00:14:39,463
INDEED, SINCE YOU FORCE ME
TO THE DISCOURTESY,

202
00:14:39,505 --> 00:14:41,257
THE LADY WAS BALD, SIR.

203
00:14:41,298 --> 00:14:44,134
HER GOLDEN TRESSES FALSE!

204
00:14:44,218 --> 00:14:47,763
HER MOUTH CRABBED WITH AGE, SIR,
AND DEVOID OF TEETH!

205
00:14:47,805 --> 00:14:52,643
IN SHORT, SIR, SHE LEFT
MUCH TO BE DESIRED.

206
00:14:52,726 --> 00:14:55,062
EXTRAORDINARY '.

207
00:14:55,145 --> 00:14:57,648
FATHER,
IT'S A SMALL THING

208
00:14:57,731 --> 00:14:59,608
AND DOUBTLESS
VERY IRRITATING TO YOU

209
00:14:59,692 --> 00:15:02,319
BUT WHEN I MARRY,
AS NEEDS I MUST ONE DAY,

210
00:15:02,361 --> 00:15:04,154
IT WILL BE FOR THE
CONVENIENCE OF LOVE,

211
00:15:04,196 --> 00:15:07,449
RATHER THAN THE CONVENIENCE
OF... CONVENIENCE.

212
00:15:07,491 --> 00:15:08,951
LOVE?
DID HE SAY LOVE?

213
00:15:08,993 --> 00:15:11,245
HA HA!
HOW ABSURD.

214
00:15:11,287 --> 00:15:15,249
WHAT HAS LOVE GOT TO DO
WITH GETTING MARRIED?

215
00:15:15,332 --> 00:15:18,877
WHY SHOULD LOVE ENTER
INTO IT AT ALL?

216
00:15:18,919 --> 00:15:23,215
LOVE CAN MAKE YOU QUITE EMOTIONALLY
HARRIED WHEN YOU'RE MARRIED

217
00:15:23,299 --> 00:15:27,219
IT'S PEDANTIC
AND ROMANTIC FOLDEROL

218
00:15:27,261 --> 00:15:31,181
FIND A MATE, DEAR BOY,
FIND A MATE

219
00:15:31,265 --> 00:15:33,309
PRINCESS SUSAN
PRINCESS KAREN

220
00:15:33,350 --> 00:15:35,311
PRINCESS KATE

221
00:15:35,352 --> 00:15:39,565
FIND A MATE, DEAR BOY,
FIND A MATE

222
00:15:39,607 --> 00:15:43,110
LOVE WILL HAVE TO WAIT

223
00:15:43,193 --> 00:15:44,236
I DISAGREE.

224
00:15:44,278 --> 00:15:45,404
YOU DISAGREE?

225
00:15:45,487 --> 00:15:47,323
HOW CAN YOU
DISAGREE, DEAR?

226
00:15:47,364 --> 00:15:48,991
LOOK AT ME.
LOOK AT US.

227
00:15:49,033 --> 00:15:51,368
Us, HA HA!
LOOK AT us.

228
00:15:51,410 --> 00:15:55,080
WHAT HAS LOVE GOT TO
DO WITH BEING MARRIED?

229
00:15:55,164 --> 00:15:59,084
BEING MARRIED IS
A PROBLEM ALL ITS OWN

230
00:15:59,126 --> 00:16:03,255
LOVE IS HIGHLY OVERRATED AND
MAKES MARRIAGE COMPLICATED

231
00:16:03,339 --> 00:16:06,467
WHEN THE BED IS
ELEVATED TO THE THRONE

232
00:16:06,550 --> 00:16:10,471
FIND A MATE, DEAR BOY,
FIND A MATE

233
00:16:10,554 --> 00:16:15,225
PICK THE PROPER PRINCESS
PRIMIED TO PROPAGATE

234
00:16:15,309 --> 00:16:19,563
FIND A MATE, DEAR BOY,
FIND A MATE

235
00:16:19,605 --> 00:16:23,776
LOVE WILL HAVE TO WAIT

236
00:16:23,859 --> 00:16:27,279
THERE IS MANY
AN ELIGIBLE MAIDEN

237
00:16:27,321 --> 00:16:31,283
OF GOOD FAMILY
WITH TITLE OF HER OWN

238
00:16:31,367 --> 00:16:35,246
WHO WOULD COME TO US
BOUNTIFULLY BELADEN

239
00:16:35,287 --> 00:16:38,499
WITH AN ARMY THAT COULD
FORTIFY OUR THRONE

240
00:16:38,582 --> 00:16:40,376
UNCLE!

241
00:16:40,417 --> 00:16:42,920
I COULDN'T HAVE SAID
THAT BETTER MYSELF.

242
00:16:42,962 --> 00:16:44,004
WELL, I COULD,

243
00:16:44,046 --> 00:16:47,424
AND IN FACT,
I THINK I WILL.

244
00:16:47,508 --> 00:16:51,220
WHAT HAS MARRIAGE GOT TO DO
WITH BEING HAPPY?

245
00:16:51,303 --> 00:16:55,349
BEING MARRIED CAN'T COMPARE
WITH BEING ROYAL

246
00:16:55,432 --> 00:16:59,228
BEING ROYAL YOU ENGENDER
EVERY LUXURY AND SPLENDOR

247
00:16:59,270 --> 00:17:03,232
WHILE A MARRIAGE
CAN GET OVERRIPE AND SPOIL

248
00:17:03,315 --> 00:17:07,069
'FIND A MATE, DEAR COUSIN,
SET THE DATE

249
00:17:07,111 --> 00:17:08,862
WHY PROCRASTINATE

250
00:17:08,904 --> 00:17:09,863
UH-UH!

251
00:17:09,947 --> 00:17:11,198
T AND STAY THE HAND OF FATE? T

252
00:17:11,282 --> 00:17:15,369
'FIND A MATE, DEAR COUSIN,
SET THE DATE

253
00:17:15,452 --> 00:17:18,539
HAPPINESS
CAN ALWAYS WAIT

254
00:17:18,622 --> 00:17:21,125
GET HIM OUT OF HERE.
GET HIM OUT.

255
00:17:22,293 --> 00:17:24,670
OH, HAVE I MADE
A LITTLE FAUX PAS?

256
00:17:24,753 --> 00:17:26,130
I WAS ENJOYING MYSELF.

257
00:17:26,213 --> 00:17:29,675
THERE, YOU SEE, THAT'S THE PRICE
THAT WE SHALL HAVE TO PAY

258
00:17:29,717 --> 00:17:31,594
UNLESS YOU NAME
THE DAY.

259
00:17:31,635 --> 00:17:35,139
LISTEN, LEND AN EAR.
I SAY AGAIN...

260
00:17:35,180 --> 00:17:39,226
WHAT HAS LOVE GOT TO DO
WITH GETTING MARRIED?

261
00:17:39,310 --> 00:17:43,355
Queen: WHAT HAS BREAD
GOT TO DO WITH WEDDING CAKE?

262
00:17:43,439 --> 00:17:47,401
WE ARE BORED WITH YOUR
DEFIANCE OF CONNUBIAL ALLIANCE

263
00:17:47,443 --> 00:17:51,405
FOR A LINE OF ROYAL GIANTS
IS AT STAKE

264
00:17:51,488 --> 00:17:54,742
FIND A MATE, DEAR BOY,
FIND A MATE

265
00:17:54,825 --> 00:17:59,163
WE ARE GROWING OLD
AND TIME IS GROWING LATE

266
00:17:59,246 --> 00:18:02,750
FIND A MATE, DEAR BOY,
FIND A MATE

267
00:18:02,833 --> 00:18:06,795
IT'S YOUR DUTY TO THE STATE
NOT TO STAY A CELIBATE

268
00:18:06,837 --> 00:18:08,297
FIND A MATE

269
00:18:08,339 --> 00:18:09,632
FIND A MATE.

FIND A MATE.
FIND A MATE.

271
00:18:11,675 --> 00:18:16,055
WHAT HAS LOVE GOT TO DO
WITH GETTING MARRIED?

272
00:18:16,138 --> 00:18:19,433
WE ARE NOT PREPARED
TO SAY.

273
00:18:50,798 --> 00:18:53,467
Woman: OH, WHAT A RELIEF

274
00:18:53,509 --> 00:18:55,803
THAT IS OVER
AND DONE WITH.

275
00:18:57,805 --> 00:19:03,894
HELP ME, MY DARLINGS. MY
FINGERS ARE POSITIVELY NUMB.

276
00:19:03,978 --> 00:19:06,230
Girl: MAMA, DIDN'T
YOU THINK THE VICAR WAS--

277
00:19:06,313 --> 00:19:08,190
Woman: GIRLS,
GIRLS, GIRLS.

278
00:19:08,232 --> 00:19:12,486
CAN YOU NEVER DO ANYTHING
WITHOUT SQUABBLING?

279
00:19:12,569 --> 00:19:14,029
BLACK WAS NEVER
MY COLOR.

280
00:19:14,071 --> 00:19:15,823
Girl :
So UNBECOMING.

281
00:19:15,864 --> 00:19:19,827
ESPECIALLY WHEN ONE'S
So YOUNG AND PRETTY.

282
00:19:19,910 --> 00:19:22,955
AND WHERE DO YOU THINK
YOU ARE GOING, CHILD?

283
00:19:22,997 --> 00:19:24,748
TO MY ROOM,
STEPMOTHER.

284
00:19:24,832 --> 00:19:27,001
YOUR ROOM?

285
00:19:27,042 --> 00:19:28,544
Girls : HER ROOM!

286
00:19:28,586 --> 00:19:32,548
Stepmother: ALL THE ROOMS
IN THIS HOUSE ARE MINE NOW.

287
00:19:34,258 --> 00:19:36,885
YOUR FATHER,
M'! LATE HUSBAND,

288
00:19:36,927 --> 00:19:40,222
SADLY MISSED BY
US ALL,

289
00:19:40,264 --> 00:19:41,849
IS DEAD, CHILD.

290
00:19:41,890 --> 00:19:45,519
DEAD AND BURIED
BENEATH THE SNOW

291
00:19:45,603 --> 00:19:50,441
IN THE SAME GRAVE
AS YOUR DEAR MOTHER.

292
00:19:50,482 --> 00:19:53,527
THAT IS A DOUBLE MISFORTUNE
FOR YOU.

293
00:19:53,569 --> 00:19:55,904
AND NOW YOU MUST START
A NEW LIFE.

294
00:19:55,946 --> 00:19:59,533
YOUR FATHER, AS A TOKEN OF
HIS GREAT LOVE FOR ME,

295
00:19:59,617 --> 00:20:00,951
SAW FIT TO MAKE A WILL

296
00:20:00,993 --> 00:20:04,079
PLACING YOU IN MY CARE
AND PROTECTION.

297
00:20:04,121 --> 00:20:05,539
MY FATHER
NEVER LOVED YOU.

298
00:20:05,623 --> 00:20:06,540
YOU TRICKED HIM.

299
00:20:06,624 --> 00:20:07,750
HOW DARE YOU, MADAM!

300
00:20:07,833 --> 00:20:09,251
YOU TRICKED HIM!

301
00:20:09,293 --> 00:20:10,794
WELL...

302
00:20:12,296 --> 00:20:15,007
WELL IF I DID,

303
00:20:15,090 --> 00:20:17,843
HE DID NOT LIVE
TO RUE THE DAY, DID HE?

304
00:20:17,927 --> 00:20:20,512
AND NOW YOU CAN CURB
YOUR TONGUE;

305
00:20:20,554 --> 00:20:22,097
CULTIVATE HUMILITY,

306
00:20:22,139 --> 00:20:24,642
KNOW YOUR PRESENT PLACE.

307
00:20:24,683 --> 00:20:27,186
I HATE YOU.

308
00:20:28,562 --> 00:20:31,065
I HATE YOU ALL.

309
00:20:31,148 --> 00:20:34,485
NOW, LISTEN TO ME, GIRL,
AND HEAR ME WELL!

310
00:20:34,526 --> 00:20:36,904
BLOOD IS THICKER
THAN A WIDOWS TEARS,

311
00:20:36,987 --> 00:20:40,407
AND GOD KNOWS I HAVE SHED
ENOUGH OF THOSE.

312
00:20:40,491 --> 00:20:43,160
I HAVE TWO DAUGHTERS
OF MY OWN TO SUPPORT,

313
00:20:43,244 --> 00:20:44,954
WHICH SITUATION
HAS FORCED ME

314
00:20:45,037 --> 00:20:47,289
TO MAKE CERTAIN ECONOMIES
IN THE HOUSEHOLD.

315
00:20:47,331 --> 00:20:48,874
IS THAT NOT SO, GIRLS?

316
00:20:48,916 --> 00:20:51,043
YES, MAMA.

317
00:20:51,085 --> 00:20:53,504
CERTAIN DRASTIC
ECONOMIES, MAMA.

318
00:20:53,545 --> 00:20:55,464
EXACTLY.

319
00:20:55,547 --> 00:20:57,508
BUT BEING A WOMAN
OF PRINCIPLE,

320
00:20:57,591 --> 00:21:00,177
I SHALL HONOR YOUR
FATHER'S LAST WISHES

321
00:21:00,219 --> 00:21:03,389
AND CONTINUE TO PROVIDE
A ROOF OVER YOUR HEAD

322
00:21:03,472 --> 00:21:05,599
BELOW STAIRS!

323
00:21:05,683 --> 00:21:08,394
AND DO NOT THINK YOU WILL
FIND SYMPATHY WITH THE STAFF.

324
00:21:08,477 --> 00:21:10,562
THE STAFF
HAVE BEEN DISMISSED.

325
00:21:10,604 --> 00:21:12,773
YOU ARE NOW THE STAFF.

326
00:21:12,856 --> 00:21:15,234
TO TAKE ORDERS
INSTEAD OF GIVING THEM.

327
00:21:15,317 --> 00:21:16,735
MOSTLY FROM US.

328
00:21:16,777 --> 00:21:18,153
NEVER.
OH, YES.

329
00:21:18,237 --> 00:21:20,322
YOU WILL COOK
AND YOU WILL CARRY.

330
00:21:20,364 --> 00:21:22,157
YOU WILL FETCH
AND YOU WILL MEND.

331
00:21:22,241 --> 00:21:24,994
YOUR FATHER'S WILL
ALLOWS AND THE LAW UPHOLDS.

332
00:21:25,035 --> 00:21:26,870
So, TAKE YOUR PICK,

333
00:21:26,912 --> 00:21:28,122
EITHER ACCEPT
YOUR LOT

334
00:21:28,163 --> 00:21:29,081
OR Go TO
THE ORPHANAGE.

335
00:21:29,206 --> 00:21:31,000
Stepsister: THEY TELL ME,
CINDERELLA,

336
00:21:31,041 --> 00:21:33,294
ONE CAN BE
AWFULLY HAPPY THERE

337
00:21:33,377 --> 00:21:34,295
AND VERY WARM.

338
00:21:34,378 --> 00:21:36,171
THEY SLEEP
6 TO A BED.

339
00:21:36,213 --> 00:21:37,339
NOT COUNTING
THE RATS.

340
00:21:37,423 --> 00:21:38,340
DO NOT TEASE,
MY DARLINGS.

341
00:21:38,382 --> 00:21:40,801
IT SPOILS
YOUR LOOKS.

342
00:21:40,884 --> 00:21:43,721
NOW, YOUR FIRST TASK WILL
BE TO MAKE US SOME SOUP.

343
00:21:43,762 --> 00:21:46,765
BURYING A HUSBAND
IS A COLD BUSINESS.

344
00:21:46,849 --> 00:21:49,977
AND SADLY FOR ME,
I HAVE NOW BURIED TWO.

345
00:21:50,060 --> 00:21:52,396
Girls: POOR MAMA!

346
00:21:52,438 --> 00:21:53,439
GIVE ME
YOUR CLOAK, GIRL.

347
00:21:53,522 --> 00:21:56,108
YOU WILL NOT BE NEEDING
IT DOWN THERE.

348
00:22:00,029 --> 00:22:02,740
HURRY, GIRL, HURRY!

349
00:22:05,117 --> 00:22:08,287
AND DO NOT KEEP US
WAITING FOR THE SOUP.

350
00:22:08,329 --> 00:22:12,082
COME ALONG, MY DOVES, WE
MUST REARRANGE THE ROOMS.

351
00:22:12,166 --> 00:22:14,835
Stepsister: OH, MAMA,
MAY I HAVE CINDERELLA'S ROOM?

352
00:22:14,919 --> 00:22:16,420
Second stepsister: No, MAMA,
YOU PROMISED ME FIRST PICK.

353
00:22:16,462 --> 00:22:17,671
SHE ALWAYS HAS EVERYTHING--
MY DARLINGS...

354
00:22:17,755 --> 00:22:20,716
EVERYTHING WILL BE FAIRLY
DIVIDED. NOW, COME ALONG.

355
00:22:20,758 --> 00:22:21,884
I'M THE ELDEST, AND I
SHOULD HAVE FIRST CHOICE.

356
00:22:21,967 --> 00:22:24,136
SHE MAY BE THE ELDEST,
BUT I'M MAMA'S FAVORITE.

357
00:22:24,178 --> 00:22:26,055
OH, NO, YOU'RE NOT.

358
00:22:26,096 --> 00:22:28,015
OH, MAMA,
sun's so BEASTLY!

359
00:22:28,098 --> 00:22:30,476
Stepmother: LITTLE STEPS,
GIRLS, LITTLE STEPS.

360
00:24:07,281 --> 00:24:12,202
ONCE I WAS LOVED

361
00:24:12,286 --> 00:24:16,707
I KNEW I WAS LOVED

362
00:24:16,749 --> 00:24:21,712
I FLEW THROUGH MY DAYS

363
00:24:21,754 --> 00:24:27,217
IN FANCIFUL WAYS

364
00:24:27,301 --> 00:24:35,809
SECURE AND SURE

365
00:24:37,311 --> 00:24:43,734
ENDLESS LOVE

366

369
00:25:14,098 --> 00:25:23,691
AND YET, MY HEART
WILL NOT DESPAIR

370
00:25:23,774 --> 00:25:28,779
FOR IT'S THERE,
JUST A MEMORY AWAY

371
00:25:38,289 --> 00:25:41,917
ONCE I WAS LOVED

372
00:25:41,959 --> 00:25:46,964
SO ALWAYS COME WHAT MAY,

HEY! HA HA!

00:26:53,489 --> 00:26:55,282
Prince: THIS PLACE
FASCINATES ME, ALWAYS HAS,

377
00:26:55,324 --> 00:26:57,993
EVER SINCE I WAS A CHILD.

378
00:27:01,747 --> 00:27:04,208
IT ISN'T JUST
THOUGHTS OF DESTINY

379
00:27:04,250 --> 00:27:06,168
OR MORBID CURIOSITY.

380
00:27:09,713 --> 00:27:12,383
LOOK HERE.

381
00:27:12,424 --> 00:27:13,968
WHEN THEY FIRST
BROUGHT ME HERE

382
00:27:14,051 --> 00:27:15,803
IT WAS PART OF MY ROYAL
EDUCATIOH, YOU SEE.

383
00:27:15,886 --> 00:27:18,764
I WAS ONLY KNEE-HIGH
TO A TOMBSTONE.

384
00:27:18,847 --> 00:27:20,641
THEY STOOD ME IN FRONT OF THIS
AND THEY SAID,

385
00:27:20,724 --> 00:27:23,769
"THAT'S YOURS.

386

VERY CHEERFUL !

HUMOR WAS NEVER
THE FAMILY'S STRONG POINT.

388
00:27:28,232 --> 00:27:29,692
I WASN'T FRIGHTENED.

389
00:27:29,733 --> 00:27:31,485
I WAS INTRIGUED.

390
00:27:31,568 --> 00:27:34,488
I SEE THEY'VE EVEN PUT
YOUR NAME ON IN ADVANCE.

391
00:27:34,571 --> 00:27:37,074
IT'S A SOBERING
THOUGHT, ISN'T IT?

392
00:27:37,157 --> 00:27:38,867
No MATTER WHAT
I DO OR DON'T DO,

393
00:27:38,909 --> 00:27:42,371

00:31:31,642 --> 00:31:32,768
I SAY YOU STOLE THEM.

468
00:31:32,851 --> 00:31:35,437
YOU'RE NOT ONLY
A LIAR BUT A THIEF,

469
00:31:35,479 --> 00:31:37,773
AND THIEVES WE KNOW
MUST BE PUNISHED.

470
00:31:37,815 --> 00:31:39,149
COME !

471
00:31:40,150 --> 00:31:41,610
THIS IS YOUR PLACE,

472
00:31:41,652 --> 00:31:43,904
AND THERE
IS YOUR TASK.

473
00:31:43,988 --> 00:31:46,407
WE ARE EXPECTING GUESTS
FOR DINNER TONIGHT...

474
00:31:46,490 --> 00:31:48,075
IMPORTANT GUESTS.

475
00:31:48,158 --> 00:31:52,288
AND FOR REPAYING MY KINDNESS
WITH CUNNING AND DECEIT,

476
00:31:52,329 --> 00:31:54,790
HENCEFORTH, YOU WILL NOT DARE
TO VENTURE FROM THIS ROOM

477
00:31:54,832 --> 00:31:55,916
WITHOUT MY SAYING.

478
00:31:56,000 --> 00:31:57,293
IS THAT UNDERSTOOD?

479
00:31:57,334 --> 00:31:58,919
YES, STEPMOTHER.

480
00:31:59,003 --> 00:32:02,423
THEN MAKE A START
AND MAKE AMENDS.

481
00:32:15,311 --> 00:32:17,104
Prince: JOHN,
TELL ME SOMETHING.

482
00:32:17,146 --> 00:32:18,397
HAVE YOU EVER WISHED
YOU WERE IN LOVE?

483
00:32:18,480 --> 00:32:19,898
OH, YES.

484
00:32:19,982 --> 00:32:22,568
OFTEN? I MEAN,
AS OFTEN AS I WISH IT?

485
00:32:22,651 --> 00:32:24,445
WELL...

486
00:32:24,486 --> 00:32:25,905
WELL, I AM IN LOVE.

487
00:32:25,988 --> 00:32:28,407
YOU ARE? HOW AMAZING.

488
00:32:28,490 --> 00:32:29,408
WHO IS SHE?

489
00:32:29,491 --> 00:32:31,201
THE LADY CAROLINE,
SIR, SINCE YOU ASK.

490
00:32:31,285 --> 00:32:33,913
WHAT? THE LADY-IN-WAITING
TO MY GRANDMOTHER?

491
00:32:33,954 --> 00:32:34,914
THAT LADY CAROLINE?

492
00:32:34,997 --> 00:32:35,915
YES.

493
00:32:35,998 --> 00:32:37,124
HOW AMAZING!

494
00:32:37,166 --> 00:32:38,083
WM.

495
00:32:38,167 --> 00:32:39,460
WELL, IT' S EXTRAORDINARY.

496
00:32:39,501 --> 00:32:41,086
NOT EXTRAORDINARILY
EXTRAORDINARY, OF COURSE,

497
00:32:41,170 --> 00:32:43,088
BUT I NEVER GUESSED.

498
00:32:43,172 --> 00:32:44,256
HEH, HEH. I KNOW.

499
00:32:44,340 --> 00:32:45,591
WELL, I'M DELIGHTED.
YOU HAVE M'! BLESSING.

500
00:32:45,674 --> 00:32:47,051
I - I - I MUST
CONGRATULATE HER.

501
00:32:47,092 --> 00:32:49,595
No! No, PLEASE, SIR.
DON'T DO THAT.

502
00:32:49,678 --> 00:32:51,931
IT'S KIND OF YOU, BUT
IT WOULDN'T BE SEEMLY.

503
00:32:52,014 --> 00:32:53,891
HOW SO?

504
00:32:53,974 --> 00:32:55,434
ALAS, MY CAUSE
IS A LOST ONE.

505
00:32:55,559 --> 00:32:57,937
WELL, THE LADY DOES NOT
RETURN YOUR AFFECTIONS?

506
00:32:58,020 --> 00:33:02,232
OH, INDEED! BUT THE FACT
REMAINS THAT I AM WHAT I AM:

507
00:33:02,274 --> 00:33:03,859
A SERVANT!

508
00:33:03,901 --> 00:33:05,819
POSITIOH, SIR.
POSITION.

509
00:33:05,903 --> 00:33:09,031
JOHN, I'M TWICE AMAZED.

510
00:33:09,073 --> 00:33:11,200
I MUST BE VERY DENSE.
AM I?

511
00:33:11,242 --> 00:33:13,035
OF COURSE NOT. YOU
HAVE YOUR PROBLEMS;

512
00:33:13,118 --> 00:33:14,912
I HAVE MINE.

513
00:33:17,289 --> 00:33:20,209
King: WHERE ARE WE?

514
00:33:20,292 --> 00:33:21,794
THAT's US?

515
00:33:23,629 --> 00:33:25,422
YOU'RE SURE THIS MAP'S
BEEN DRAWN TO SCALE?

516
00:33:25,464 --> 00:33:26,590
I BELIEVE SO,
YOUR MAJESTY.

517
00:33:26,632 --> 00:33:28,050
THEN WHAT HAVE I BEEN
LOOKING AT ALL THESE YEARS?

518
00:33:28,133 --> 00:33:30,094
I THOUGHT THAT WAS US.

519
00:33:31,595 --> 00:33:35,891
I ALWAYS GO BY
THE BROWN PARTS FOR THE LAND

520
00:33:35,975 --> 00:33:38,269
AND THE BLUE PARTS
FOR THE SEA.

521
00:33:38,310 --> 00:33:39,228
WHO'S THAT?

522
00:33:39,270 --> 00:33:40,229
FIRST LORD OF
THE NAVY, SIRE.

523
00:33:40,312 --> 00:33:41,230
HAVE WE GOT A NAVY?

524
00:33:41,272 --> 00:33:42,356
THE ROYAL BARGE
ON THE LAKE?

525
00:33:42,439 --> 00:33:43,399
OH, YES, YES.

526
00:33:43,482 --> 00:33:44,900
WELL, REMIND ME NOT
TO TRAVEL IN IT AGAIN.

527
00:33:44,942 --> 00:33:48,237
King: SO, EVEN ALLOWING FOR
ERRORS IN THE CARTOGRAPHER'S ART,

528
00:33:48,279 --> 00:33:52,116
WE ARE SMALL IN COMPARISON
WITH OUR NEIGHBORS.

529
00:33:52,157 --> 00:33:54,410
THOUGH GREAT IN, AHH,
WHAT'S THE WORD?

530
00:33:54,451 --> 00:33:55,744
ER, TRADITION?

531
00:33:55,828 --> 00:33:58,372
TRADITIOH, YES. GREAT
IN TRADITION AND SPIRIT,

532
00:33:58,455 --> 00:34:01,208
IN FACT, WE ARE SMALL.

533
00:34:01,250 --> 00:34:02,876
HEAR, HEAR.

534
00:34:02,960 --> 00:34:04,044
SO WE HAVE TO HAVE A PLAN!

535
00:34:04,128 --> 00:34:06,338
NOW, YOU'RE ALL AWARE
OF THE PROBLEMS

536
00:34:06,422 --> 00:34:08,716
OF MY SON'S RELUCTANCE TO
HAVE A PERFECTLY GOOD WIFE

537
00:34:08,757 --> 00:34:10,175
CHOSEN FOR HIM.

538
00:34:10,301 --> 00:34:11,719
THIS GENERATION HAS
No RESPECT AT ALL.

539
00:34:11,760 --> 00:34:16,348
I MEAN, I WAS MARRIED OFF
BEFORE I WAS 14!

540
00:34:16,432 --> 00:34:19,018
CAROLSFELD - -WHERE'S THAT?

541
00:34:19,101 --> 00:34:23,397
AH, YOU SEE, THE SIZE OF IT,
SEE THE SIZE OF IT. PERFECT.

542
00:34:23,480 --> 00:34:25,065
NOW, WHAT'S THE SOLUTION?

543
00:34:25,149 --> 00:34:26,400
WITH RESPECT,
YOUR MAJESTY,

544
00:34:26,483 --> 00:34:29,570
I HAVE PREPARED
A SMALL PAPER.

545
00:34:29,653 --> 00:34:32,573
WHAT I AM SEEKING
IS A PROPER BALANCE,

546
00:34:32,656 --> 00:34:34,241
WEIGHING
WHAT WE SACK

547
00:34:34,283 --> 00:34:36,243
AGAINST WHAT
WE HAVE TO OFFER.

548
00:34:36,285 --> 00:34:39,914
OH, FOR GOODNESS SAKES, STOP TALKING
IN THOSE BORING, DIPLOMATIC RIDDLES.

549
00:34:39,997 --> 00:34:40,956
SPEAK THE KING'S
EUPHRANIAN, MAN!

550
00:34:41,040 --> 00:34:43,584
FORGIVE ME, YOUR MAJESTY.

551
00:34:43,667 --> 00:34:46,587
I HAD IN MIND A CELEBRATION.

552
00:34:46,629 --> 00:34:47,755
King: WHAT ARE YOU
GOING TO CELEBRATE?

553
00:34:47,838 --> 00:34:48,923
A MARRIAGE, SIRE.

554
00:34:48,964 --> 00:34:50,090
GETTING MARRIED AGAIN?

555
00:34:50,174 --> 00:34:51,550
HMM. FINALLY
GOT RID OF HER, EH?

556
00:34:51,634 --> 00:34:53,260
WELL, NOT MY MARRIAGE, SIRE.

557
00:34:53,344 --> 00:34:55,429
HIS ROYAL HIGHNESS,
THE PRINCE EDWARD'S.

558
00:34:55,512 --> 00:34:56,430
WELL, WE'D ALL LIKE
TO CELEBRATE THAT.

559
00:34:56,472 --> 00:34:57,765
THAT'S WHAT
WE'RE TALKING ABOUT.

560
00:34:57,848 --> 00:35:00,100
SOMETIMES I THINK I'M
SURROUNDED BY A LOT OF IDIOTS.

561
00:35:00,184 --> 00:35:02,227
HERE WE ARE, HEDGED
IN BY HOSTILE FORCES,

562
00:35:02,269 --> 00:35:05,564
AND ALL YOU CAN THINK OF IS
SOMETHING THAT'S BEEN THOUGHT OF.

563
00:35:05,648 --> 00:35:08,525
SIRE, THIS TIME,
I HAVE A NEW IDEA,

564
00:35:08,609 --> 00:35:11,528
AN IDEA THAT THE PRINCE HIMSELF
WILL NOT BE ABLE TO RESIST!

565
00:35:11,570 --> 00:35:13,280
WELL, MAKE SURE
THAT SHE'S GOT TEETH.

566
00:35:13,364 --> 00:35:14,740
HE'S GOT AN OBSESSION
ABOUT THEM HAVING TEETH.

567
00:35:14,782 --> 00:35:16,825
I THOUGHT, A BALL!

568
00:35:16,867 --> 00:35:18,535
A BALL?

569
00:35:18,619 --> 00:35:20,746
A GREAT BALL !

570
00:35:20,788 --> 00:35:24,208
THE GREATEST BALL THAT
HAS EVER BEEN KNOWN, SIRE.

571
00:35:24,250 --> 00:35:27,836
AND TO IT, WE WILL INVITE EVERY
ELIGIBLE PRINCESS IN EUROPE,

572
00:35:27,920 --> 00:35:31,215
AND EVEN BEYOND,
YOUR MAJESTY.

573
00:35:31,298 --> 00:35:32,591
WHAT DO YOU THINK
OF THAT IDEA?

574
00:35:32,633 --> 00:35:35,052
I REMEMBER MY FIRST BALL.

575
00:35:35,094 --> 00:35:37,137
YES, WELL, WE DON'T WANT TO Go
INTO THE REALMS OE FANTASY.

576
00:35:37,179 --> 00:35:38,097
WHAT ELSE?

577
00:35:38,180 --> 00:35:41,350
I HAVE PREPARED A LIST,
your: MAJESTY,

578
00:35:41,392 --> 00:35:43,727
AND I THOUGHT WE COULD
MAKE SUCH PREPARATIONS

579
00:35:43,811 --> 00:35:46,730
AS WOULD DAZZLE
OUR ENEMIES AND DMDE THEM,

580
00:35:46,772 --> 00:35:49,942
FOR PROTOCOL WOULD NOT
ALLOW THEM TO MAKE WAR

581
00:35:49,984 --> 00:35:51,402
WHILE THEY ARE GUESTS
IN OUR MIDST.

582
00:35:51,485 --> 00:35:53,821
AND I REMAIN CONVINCED
THAT THE PRINCE, YOUR SON,

583
00:35:53,862 --> 00:35:55,114
WILL DO HIS DUTY.

584
00:35:55,197 --> 00:35:58,576
INDEED, FACE TO FACE IN THE
PRESENCE OF THE ENTIRE COURT

585
00:35:58,659 --> 00:36:00,786
HE COULD HARDLY FAIL
TO DO ANYTHING ELSE.

586
00:36:00,828 --> 00:36:03,205
General: THE OCCASION,
THE MUSIC, THE CANDLELIGHT,

587
00:36:03,247 --> 00:36:05,124
THE SWIRLING DRESSES,
THE PERFUME,

588
00:36:05,207 --> 00:36:07,710
THE VERY ATMOSPHERE OF LOVE!

589
00:36:07,751 --> 00:36:09,878
PUT HIM ON
THE RETIREMENT LIST.

590
00:36:09,920 --> 00:36:11,672
I SHALL MAKE
A ROYAL DECISION!

591
00:36:11,755 --> 00:36:14,008
TAKING THIS IDEA
AND IMPROVING ON IT,

592
00:36:14,091 --> 00:36:16,468
WE MUST PLAN EVERY DETAIL.

593
00:36:16,552 --> 00:36:17,595
NOBLESSE OBLIGE!

594
00:36:17,595 --> 00:36:18,887
Chamberlain:
QUITE SO, YOUR MAJESTY.

595
00:36:18,929 --> 00:36:21,390
YOU UNDERSTAND THAT
I'M TALKING ABOUT DIPLOMACY.

596
00:36:21,432 --> 00:36:22,933
PROTOCOL!

597
00:36:25,102 --> 00:36:31,233
YES, WE MUST BE
PROTOCOLIGORICALLY CORRECT

598
00:36:31,275 --> 00:36:35,696
GOOD FORM MUST NEVER SUFFER
FROM NEGLECT

599

THE RULES AND
REGULATIONS WE RESPECT

601
00:36:41,952 --> 00:36:44,079
ELSE THE KINGDOM
WILL BE WRECKED

602
00:36:44,121 --> 00:36:46,040
WE'VE A SYSTEM TO PROTECT

603
00:36:46,123 --> 00:36:47,708
CHECKED AND DOUBLE-CHECKED

604

605
00:36:50,794 --> 00:36:53,213
SIRE! PLEASE, SIRE.

606
00:36:53,297 --> 00:36:56,759
WHEN ITS ARMY IS
BATTERED AND BROKEN

607

AND BACK TO ITS
BORDERS IT CRAWLS

608

609
00:37:03,724 --> 00:37:06,852
IF NOT TO ITS PROTOCOLS?

610
00:37:06,936 --> 00:37:10,356
AND WHEN THE TREASURY'S
TAPPED OF ITS TREASURES

611
00:37:10,439 --> 00:37:13,525
ARE THE TAPESTRIES
STRIPPED FROM THE WALLS?

612
00:37:13,567 --> 00:37:17,363
No, THE COURT CARRIES ON
WITH ITS PLEASURES

613
00:37:17,446 --> 00:37:19,990
INQUISITIONS
AND BANQUETS AND BALLS

00:37:43,931 --> 00:37:45,099
PRECEDENT!

624
00:37:45,140 --> 00:37:47,393
WE NEED A BOOK THAT WILL
GIVE US CHAPTER AND VERSE.

625
00:37:47,476 --> 00:37:49,228
IN THE LIBRARY--
IT'LL BE IN THE LIBRARY.

626
00:37:49,311 --> 00:37:53,899
I BELIEVE WE ARE ALREADY WITHIN
THE LIBRARY, YOUR MAJESTY.

627
00:37:53,983 --> 00:37:55,943
WELL, OF COURSE,
OF COURSE.

628
00:37:55,985 --> 00:37:57,236
I KNEW THAT !

629
00:37:57,319 --> 00:37:58,904
WHAT VOLUME
DO YOU SUGGEST?

630
00:37:58,988 --> 00:38:01,282
THERE IS ONLY ONE,
YOUR MAJESTY, THE BIBLE.

631
00:38:01,323 --> 00:38:02,825
BIBLE?! WELL, LET'S KEEP
RELIGION OUT OF IT.

632
00:38:02,866 --> 00:38:05,327
NO, SIRE. I SHOULD
SAY IN THIS CASE,

633
00:38:05,369 --> 00:38:07,663
THE BIBLE IS FORMS
AND ADDRESSES

634
00:38:07,705 --> 00:38:09,665
FOR ROYAL OCCASIONS
B'! DE LYON.

635
00:38:09,748 --> 00:38:10,874
AH.

636
00:38:10,916 --> 00:38:12,501
NOW THEN,
LET ME SEE, SIRE...

637
00:38:12,585 --> 00:38:14,211
ABDICATIONS,
DISMISSAL OF MINISTERS,

638
00:38:14,253 --> 00:38:15,504
GARDEN PARTIES,
INVESTITURES...

639
00:38:15,546 --> 00:38:16,672
JUDICIAL BEHEADINGS"

640
00:38:16,755 --> 00:38:17,840
YES, SKIP ALL THAT.

641
00:38:17,881 --> 00:38:20,175
YOUR MAJESTY, QUESTIONS
OF PRECEDENT PERTAINING

642
00:38:20,217 --> 00:38:22,344
TO THE SEATING
OF CROWNED HEADS

643
00:38:22,428 --> 00:38:23,887
IN DIFFICULT SITUATIONS.

644
00:38:23,929 --> 00:38:26,056
AHH! WE SHOULD REHEARSE IT!

645
00:38:26,098 --> 00:38:28,392
UH, YOU CAN BE
THE PRINCESS ESMERELDA,

646
00:38:28,434 --> 00:38:30,436
EVER WILLING TO SERVE,
YOUR MAJESTY.

647
00:38:30,519 --> 00:38:33,230
AND YOU THE DUCHESS
OF RAMBOUILLET,

648
00:38:33,355 --> 00:38:37,526
AND YOU THE DAUGHTER OF
THE EMPEROR OF BRATISLAVA,

649
00:38:37,610 --> 00:38:39,737
AND, UH... OH, THE REST OF YOU CAN
SORT IT OUT AMONGST YOURSELVES.

650
00:38:39,778 --> 00:38:43,198
WHAT AN INSPIRED IDEA,
YOUR MAJESTY.

651
00:38:43,240 --> 00:38:46,702
IF THE DAUGHTER OF
THE DUCHESS OF SNARDEN

652
00:38:46,785 --> 00:38:50,915
WERE TO BE SEATED BY
THE COUNTESS OF SNEAD

653
00:38:50,956 --> 00:38:54,877
FOR THIS BREACH
OF DECORUM TO SNARDEN

654
00:38:54,960 --> 00:38:58,422
THE INVASION
OF SNEAD WOULD PROCEED QI

655
00:38:58,464 --> 00:39:02,343
AND SEAT THE HEIRESS
TO THE BARONY OF NEUBURG

656
00:39:02,384 --> 00:39:05,179
BY THE SIDE OF HER
HATED COUSIN GWENN

657
00:39:05,262 --> 00:39:09,808
OH, HOW QUICKLY
THE ARMIES OF NEUBURG

658
00:39:09,892 --> 00:39:13,354
WOULD DEPLOY
TO DESTROY US AGAIN

659
00:39:13,437 --> 00:39:18,859

WELL, NOW!

693
00:41:29,615 --> 00:41:31,909
WERE YOU EXPECTING ME?

694
00:41:31,992 --> 00:41:35,621
NO. I WASN'T
EXPECTING ANYBODY.

695
00:41:35,663 --> 00:41:39,416
FUNNY. YOU SHOULD
HAVE FELT SOMETHING.

696
00:41:39,541 --> 00:41:41,418
I'M LOSING MY TOUCH.

697
00:41:41,502 --> 00:41:43,754
COULD I COME IN AND REST
BY YOUR FIRE, PLEASE?

698
00:41:43,837 --> 00:41:46,090
I'VE BEEN TRAVELING
A LONG WAY.

699
00:41:46,131 --> 00:41:50,928
WELL... I'M NOT SUPPOSED TO
TALK TO ANYBODY OR SEE ANYBODY,

700
00:41:50,970 --> 00:41:53,013
BUT...

701
00:41:53,097 --> 00:41:55,766
YES, OF COURSE.

702
00:41:55,808 --> 00:41:58,435
YOU'RE WELCOME
TO SHARE MY FIRE...

703
00:41:58,477 --> 00:42:00,437
SUCH AS IT IS,

704
00:42:00,521 --> 00:42:02,940
BUT I'D BE OBLIGED
IF YOU DIDN'T STAY TOO LONG.

705
00:42:05,776 --> 00:42:08,028
PLEASE EXCUSE ME
IF I CARRY ON WORKING,

706
00:42:08,112 --> 00:42:10,447
BUT I HAVE TO FINISH
THESE, AND I'M VERY SLOW.

707
00:42:10,489 --> 00:42:15,160
YES! WELL, THERE ARE MORE WAYS
THAN ONE OF PEELING POTATOES.

708
00:42:19,290 --> 00:42:21,041
THE FIRE SEEMS
TO HAVE CHEERED UP.

709
00:42:21,125 --> 00:42:23,043
I COULD WARM YOU A LITTLE
BROTH IF YOU LIKE.

710
00:42:23,127 --> 00:42:26,213
No, THANK YOU.
BUT THANK YOU FOR THE THOUGHT.

711
00:42:28,632 --> 00:42:30,718
LIVE DOWN HERE
on YOUR own, no YOU?

712
00:42:30,801 --> 00:42:33,095
I DO NOW.
YES.

713
00:42:33,137 --> 00:42:34,930
THINGS HAVE CHANGED.

714
00:42:34,972 --> 00:42:37,099
BUT THAT DOESN'T MEAN TO SAY
THEY WON'T CHANGE AGAIN.

715
00:42:37,141 --> 00:42:39,935
I GET AROUND QUITE A BIT,
YOU KNOW.

716
00:42:39,977 --> 00:42:41,228
MUST BE NICE TO TRAVEL.

717
00:42:41,270 --> 00:42:43,230
YES AND No.

718
00:42:43,314 --> 00:42:46,942
I SOMETIMES WISH
I COULD SETTLE IN ONE PLACE,

719
00:42:46,984 --> 00:42:49,445
BUT THERE'S NEVER ENOUGH TIME.

720
00:42:49,486 --> 00:42:54,909
I'D LIKE SOMEWHERE COZY,
WITH A DOG TO KEEP ME COMPANY.

721
00:42:54,992 --> 00:42:57,202
I EXPECT YOUR DOG IS
A GREAT COMFORT TO YOU.

722
00:42:57,286 --> 00:43:00,372
MY DOG?
I HAVEN'T GOT A DOG.

723
00:43:00,414 --> 00:43:03,417
ISN'T HE YOURS?

724
00:43:04,460 --> 00:43:05,878
WHERE DID HE COME FROM?

725
00:43:05,961 --> 00:43:07,671
HE CAME IN WHEN I CAME IN.

726
00:43:10,799 --> 00:43:15,179
OH! OH, WHAT AM I GOING
TO DO WITH HIM?

727
00:43:15,262 --> 00:43:16,889
WELL, WHY DON'T
YOU KEEP HIM?

728
00:43:16,972 --> 00:43:19,224
HE'LL TAKE CARE
OF HIMSELF.

729
00:43:19,308 --> 00:43:21,727
HE'S AN OLD HAND AT THAT.

730
00:43:21,810 --> 00:43:23,228
OHH!

731
00:43:23,312 --> 00:43:25,064
HE SEEMS TO LIKE YOU.

732
00:43:25,147 --> 00:43:27,107
OH, I LOVE HIM!

733
00:43:27,149 --> 00:43:30,027
I'M JUST SO AFRAID OF WHAT
MY STEPMOTHER WILL SAY.

734
00:43:30,152 --> 00:43:31,737
Stepmother: CINDERELLA!

735
00:43:31,820 --> 00:43:34,907
THERE SHE IS,
AND I HAVEN'T FINISHED!

736
00:43:34,949 --> 00:43:36,075
I'VE GOT TO HIDE YOU.

737
00:43:36,158 --> 00:43:39,245
WELL, I'LL BE OFF.
I'VE SEEN WHAT I WANT TO SEE.

738
00:43:39,286 --> 00:43:41,247
YOU JUST TAKE CARE OF HIM.

739
00:43:41,330 --> 00:43:44,416
Stepmother: CINDERELLA!

740
00:43:44,500 --> 00:43:47,920
I KNOW! I'LL HIDE
YOU UNDER HERE.

741
00:43:48,003 --> 00:43:51,215
PROMISE NOT
TO MAKE A SOUND.

742
00:43:51,257 --> 00:43:53,259
HAVE YOU BEEN
STRUCK DUMB, GIRL?

743
00:43:53,342 --> 00:43:56,095
OH!
OH!

744
00:43:56,178 --> 00:43:58,097
ANSWER ME WHEN I CALL.

745
00:43:58,180 --> 00:44:01,684
YOU KNOW I HATE HAVING
TO RAISE M'! VOICE.

746
00:44:01,725 --> 00:44:06,689
NOW, I HOPE YOU HAVE
BEEN HARD AT WORK. I...

747
00:44:13,779 --> 00:44:15,447
I SEE.

748
00:44:20,286 --> 00:44:21,787
WELL, UH...

749
00:44:23,914 --> 00:44:25,457
UH, I SEE.

750
00:44:28,794 --> 00:44:32,965
I SEE I SHALL HAVE TO GIVE
YOU MORE TO DO NEXT TIME.

751
00:44:45,644 --> 00:44:47,813
WHAT DO YOU MAKE OF ALL THAT?

752
00:44:52,735 --> 00:44:54,069
King: I WILL NOT HAVE
MY AUTHORITY FLOUTED

753
00:44:54,153 --> 00:44:55,112
IN THIS FASHION.

754
00:44:55,154 --> 00:44:56,405
IT HAS ALWAYS BEEN THE CUSTOM

755
00:44:56,488 --> 00:44:59,116
FOR THE HEIR TO THE THRONE
TO TAKE A WIFE IN GOOD TIME.

756
00:44:59,158 --> 00:45:01,410
AND YOU SHOW A STRANGE RELUCTANCE
TO COMPLY WITH TRADITION.

757
00:45:01,452 --> 00:45:04,038
FATHER,
I EMPHATICALLY DISAGREE.

758
00:45:04,121 --> 00:45:07,541
AND I TOTALLY REFUSE TO TAKE PART
IN SUCH AN EMBARRASSING CHARADE.

759
00:45:07,625 --> 00:45:08,542
BUT I'VE DECREED IT!

760
00:45:08,626 --> 00:45:09,877
THEN YOU MUST
UNDECREE IT.

761
00:45:09,960 --> 00:45:11,045
IMPOSSIBLE !

762
00:45:11,128 --> 00:45:12,254
YOU TALK TO HIM.

763
00:45:12,296 --> 00:45:13,255
DEAREST BOY--

764
00:45:13,339 --> 00:45:14,548
OH, MOTHER,
IT'S NO USE TRYING

765
00:45:14,590 --> 00:45:16,008
TO GET ROUND ME
THAT WAY.

766
00:45:16,133 --> 00:45:17,384
THE VERY IDEA
OF GIVING A BALL

767
00:45:17,468 --> 00:45:19,511
AND INVITING A SELECTION
OF TITLED WALLFLOWERS

768
00:45:19,595 --> 00:45:21,847
TO VIE FOR MY HAND
IS UTTERLY REPULSIVE!

769
00:45:21,931 --> 00:45:24,224
DEGRADING
TO ALL CONCERNED.

770
00:45:24,266 --> 00:45:26,226
IN MY DAY,
I NEVER HAD THE CHOICE!

771
00:45:26,310 --> 00:45:28,062
NOT THAT I WOULD HAVE CHOSEN
ANY DIFFERENTLY, OF COURSE.

772
00:45:28,145 --> 00:45:30,397
YOU TAKE A DECISION
WITHOUT CONSULTING ME.

773
00:45:30,481 --> 00:45:32,566
WELL I AM YOUR FATHER,
AND I AM THE KING!

774
00:45:32,650 --> 00:45:34,526
IT'S LIKE SOME
SORDID BEAUTY CONTEST

775
00:45:34,610 --> 00:45:36,612
WITH ME
AS THE GRAND PRIZE.

776
00:45:36,695 --> 00:45:38,989
SINCE YOU WON'T GO TO MECCA,
MECCA MUST COME TO YOU!

777
00:45:39,073 --> 00:45:41,742
Queen: YOU HAVE TO GET
MARRIED SOMEDAY, DEAR.

778
00:45:41,825 --> 00:45:43,410
BUT NOT IN THIS WAY.

779
00:45:43,494 --> 00:45:47,289
WELL, IT SEEMS PERFECTLY
REASONABLE TO ME.

780
00:45:47,331 --> 00:45:50,751
WE'VE INVITED EVERY ELIGIBLE
PRINCESS IN THE ALMANAC.

781
00:45:50,834 --> 00:45:52,503
AND IT'S A QUESTION OF DUTY!

782
00:45:52,544 --> 00:45:56,590
FATHER, I HAVE NEVER QUESTIONED
THAT IT IS MY BOUNDEN DUTY

783
00:45:56,632 --> 00:45:59,760
TO TAKE A WIFE AND ENSURE
THE ROYAL SUCCESSION.

784
00:45:59,843 --> 00:46:03,514
BUT THAT DOES NOT MEAN I HAVE TO BE
PARTY TO AND JUDGE A CATTLE SHOW!

785
00:46:03,597 --> 00:46:04,848
WHOEVER HEARD
OF SUCH A THING?

786
00:46:04,890 --> 00:46:07,017
CAP-CATTLE SHOW!

787
00:46:07,059 --> 00:46:09,853
A BRIDE-FINDING BALL SI

788
00:46:09,937 --> 00:46:11,897
A BRIDE-FINDING BALL SI

789
00:46:11,939 --> 00:46:14,567
WHERE EVERY MAIDEN'S
BOUND TO LAUGH AT ME

790
00:46:14,608 --> 00:46:16,694
THE ROYAL
FATTED CALF

791
00:46:16,777 --> 00:46:19,029
A BRIDE-FINDING BALL SI

792
00:46:19,071 --> 00:46:20,990
A BRIDE-FINDING BALL SI

793
00:46:21,031 --> 00:46:22,866
THOUGH I'M THE ONE
WHO DOES THE CHOOSING

794
00:46:22,950 --> 00:46:26,704
I'M THE ONE
WHO DOES THE LOSING

795
00:46:26,787 --> 00:46:29,206
IT'S NAUSEATING,
NAUSEATING!

796
00:46:29,290 --> 00:46:31,375
CAN'T YOU
JUST IMAGINE IT?

797
00:46:31,417 --> 00:46:33,210
HOPE SPRINGS IN ALL

798
00:46:33,252 --> 00:46:35,212
SHORT, FAT, OR TALL

799
00:46:35,296 --> 00:46:37,756
AS THEY PRIMP
AND PREEN AND PRAY

800
00:46:37,840 --> 00:46:40,050
THAT THIS WILL BE
THEIR LUCKY DAY

801
00:46:40,092 --> 00:46:42,261
THERE IS NO AFFAIR

802
00:46:42,303 --> 00:46:44,096
OF WHICH I'M AWARE

803
00:46:44,138 --> 00:46:47,891
MORE GALLING TO BEAR
THAN A BRIDE-FINDING BALL

804
00:46:47,975 --> 00:46:49,393
Montague:
I JUST HEARD THE NEWS!

805
00:46:49,476 --> 00:46:50,728
King: OH,
WHO LET HIM IN?

806
00:46:50,769 --> 00:46:54,189
IS IT TRUE, DEAR UNCLE?

807
00:46:54,231 --> 00:46:57,234
THE TATTLE IS THAT YOU'RE GOING
TO INVITE A WHOLE NURSERY

808
00:46:57,318 --> 00:46:58,986
OF NUBILE DELICACIES
TO A BALL.

809
00:46:59,069 --> 00:47:01,280
SOME OTHER TIME, NEPHEW.
WE'RE BUSY NOW.

810
00:47:01,322 --> 00:47:02,615
OH, BUT YOU CAN'T
KEEP ME IN SUSPENSE.

811
00:47:02,698 --> 00:47:04,033
YOU JUST CAN'T, UNCLE.

812
00:47:04,074 --> 00:47:06,368
I MEAN, I REALIZE THAT
I WON'T HAVE FIRST PICK,

813
00:47:06,410 --> 00:47:08,829
BUT THAT DOESN'T MATTER TO ME
BECAUSE I'M NOT PROUD.

814
00:47:08,913 --> 00:47:09,830
I'M JUST DESPERATE.

815
00:47:09,914 --> 00:47:11,707
WE'RE ALL DESPERATE!

816
00:47:11,749 --> 00:47:15,336
SO IT'S TRUE, THEN!
OH, HOW EXCITING!

817
00:47:15,419 --> 00:47:19,715
NOW, I MUST DECIDE
WHAT TO WEAR.

818
00:47:19,757 --> 00:47:22,718
HIGH HEELS, I THINK, TO
GIVE ME ADDED STATURE.

819
00:47:22,760 --> 00:47:24,887
THE MOMENT YOU'VE
MADE YOUR CHOICE,

820
00:47:24,929 --> 00:47:26,680
I SHALL UNLEASH MYSELF.

821
00:47:26,764 --> 00:47:28,724
I'VE ALREADY MADE
MY CHOICE, COUSIN.

822
00:47:28,766 --> 00:47:29,975
AS FAR AS I'M CONCERNED,

823
00:47:30,059 --> 00:47:31,101
YOU CAN HAVE YOUR
PICK OF THE LOT.

824
00:47:31,143 --> 00:47:32,353
OH, BUT YOU CAN'T DO THAT!

825
00:47:32,394 --> 00:47:35,064
YOU CAN'T BE SUCH
A SPOILSPORT! I MEAN...

826
00:47:35,105 --> 00:47:38,067
A BRIDE-FINDING BALL SI

827
00:47:38,108 --> 00:47:40,736
A BRIDE-FINDING BALL SI

828
00:47:40,778 --> 00:47:44,073
WHERE LUSCIOUS LOVELIES
FROM EACH LAND

829
00:47:44,114 --> 00:47:47,701
WILL VIE TO WIN
THE ROYAL HAND

830
00:47:47,743 --> 00:47:50,579
A BRIDE-FINDING BALL SI

831
00:47:50,621 --> 00:47:53,249
A BRIDE-FINDING BALL SI

832
00:47:53,290 --> 00:47:56,377
WITH FRILLS ON TRESSES,
PARTY DRESSES

833
00:47:56,460 --> 00:48:00,923
EVERY MAIDEN EFFERVESCES

834
00:48:00,965 --> 00:48:02,967
GIVING HER BEST

835
00:48:03,092 --> 00:48:05,678
GVING HER ALL

836
00:48:05,761 --> 00:48:08,514
DANCING, GLANCING,
LAUGHING, TEASING

837
00:48:08,597 --> 00:48:10,683
WHIRLING, SWIRLING

838
00:48:10,766 --> 00:48:14,728
TOUCHING, SQUEEZING

839
00:48:14,812 --> 00:48:17,189
THERE'S NO AFFAIR

840
00:48:17,273 --> 00:48:19,858
TO EVER COMPARE

841
00:48:19,942 --> 00:48:21,360
OR THRILL OR ENTHRALL

842
00:48:21,443 --> 00:48:24,613
LIKE A BRIDE-FINDING BALL

843
00:48:28,993 --> 00:48:31,203
Chamberlain: YOUR MAJESTY.

844
00:48:31,287 --> 00:48:32,705
King: WELL, WHAT IS IT?

845
00:48:32,746 --> 00:48:35,874
I BRING GRAVE TIDINGS.

846
00:48:35,958 --> 00:48:38,919
CAROLSFELD HAS MOBILIZED.

847
00:48:39,003 --> 00:48:40,212
THERE IS TALK OF WAR.

848
00:48:40,254 --> 00:48:41,213
WAR?!
WAR?!

849
00:48:41,297 --> 00:48:42,381
WAR.
WAR.

850
00:48:42,464 --> 00:48:44,883
AS YOUR MAJESTY'S
SENIOR MINISTER OF STATE,

851
00:48:44,967 --> 00:48:49,722
IT IS MY SOLEMN DUTY TO ADVISE YOU
THAT THE SITUATION IS CRITICAL.

852
00:48:49,805 --> 00:48:52,725
THE NEWS THAT HIS ROYAL
HIGHNESS SAW FIT TO DECLINE

853
00:48:52,766 --> 00:48:54,560
THE HAND OF THE
PRINCESS SELINA IN MARRIAGE,

854
00:48:54,643 --> 00:48:55,644
WAS ILL-RECEIVED.

855
00:48:55,686 --> 00:48:56,645
TRUE.
TRUE.

856
00:48:56,687 --> 00:48:59,732
EDWARD, M'! sou...

857
00:48:59,815 --> 00:49:03,694
I BESEECH YOU NOT AS A
FATHER BUT AS YOUR MONARCH.

858
00:49:03,736 --> 00:49:06,030
RECONSIDER BEFORE
IT'S TOO LATE.

859
00:49:06,071 --> 00:49:08,824
PUT ASIDE YOUR
PERSONAL FEELINGS.

860
00:49:08,908 --> 00:49:11,201
THE WHOLE COUNTRY LOOKS TO
YOU TO FORM AN ALLIANCE

861
00:49:11,243 --> 00:49:13,370
THROUGH
THE MARRIAGE BED.

862
00:49:13,412 --> 00:49:16,040
AND DO AS I DID WHEN
I TOOK YOUR MOTHER.

863
00:49:16,081 --> 00:49:19,084
I CLOSED MY EYES AND
THOUGHT OF EUPHRANIA.

864
00:49:42,733 --> 00:49:44,818
Chamberlain: BRATISLAVA!

865
00:49:49,448 --> 00:49:52,409
WILDENSTEIN!

866
00:49:52,451 --> 00:49:53,953
NEUBURG !

867
00:50:19,812 --> 00:50:21,814
OH!
OH!

868
00:50:47,339 --> 00:50:48,591
AAH!

869
00:51:02,146 --> 00:51:03,647
UHH!

870
00:51:05,316 --> 00:51:07,234
King: HOW MANY
DOES THAT MAKE?

871
00:51:07,318 --> 00:51:09,278
WELL, YOUR MAJESTY, OF THE
COURIERS WHO RETURNED,

872
00:51:09,320 --> 00:51:13,157
6 HAVE REPORTED
ACCEPTANCES.

873
00:51:13,198 --> 00:51:15,242
IN ADDITIOH, THERE
WERE 5 REFUSALS.

874
00:51:15,326 --> 00:51:18,245
ONE OF THEM COUCHED IN
THE MOST OBSCENE TERMS.

875
00:51:18,287 --> 00:51:20,247
TWO OF THOSE
INVITED WERE DEAD,

876
00:51:20,331 --> 00:51:23,250
AND THE REMAINING 3
COULD NOT BE TRACED.

877
00:51:23,292 --> 00:51:25,711
THAT MAKES 6 OUT OF 16.

878
00:51:25,794 --> 00:51:28,047
WELL, I THINK THAT'S
A FAIR AVERAGE, DON'T YOU?

879
00:51:28,130 --> 00:51:29,256
YES, INDEED, SIRE.

880
00:51:29,340 --> 00:51:31,258
PERHAPS NOT QUITE
THE BREADTH OF CHOICE

881
00:51:31,342 --> 00:51:33,928
WE AT FIRST ENVISAGED.

882
00:51:34,011 --> 00:51:36,430
WELL, INVITE ALL LOCAL
NOBILITY AS WELL.

883
00:51:36,513 --> 00:51:38,057
WE DON'T WANT
THE PLACE HALF EMPTY.

884
00:51:38,140 --> 00:51:39,975
WE CAN ALWAYS RAISE
THE TAXES TO PAY FOR IT.

885
00:51:40,059 --> 00:51:43,604
IN FACT, I'LL INVENT A NEW TAX,
A TAX ON SNOBBERY.

886
00:51:43,687 --> 00:51:44,605
THEY'LL ALL PAY THAT.

887
00:51:44,688 --> 00:51:46,607
BRILLIANT, YOUR MAJESTY!
BRILLIANT!

888
00:51:46,690 --> 00:51:47,608
DON'T OVER DO IT.
DON'T OVER DO IT.

889
00:51:47,691 --> 00:51:49,610
YOU'LL BE PAYING IT, TOO.

890
00:51:49,693 --> 00:51:52,613
Stepmother: GIRLS! GIRLS!

891
00:51:52,696 --> 00:51:54,281
ISOBELLA! PALATINE!

892
00:51:54,365 --> 00:51:55,282
Isobella and Palatine:
RIGHT HERE, MAMA!

893
00:51:55,366 --> 00:51:57,117
COME QUICKLY!

894
00:51:57,201 --> 00:51:58,786
WHAT IS IT, MAMA?

895
00:51:58,869 --> 00:52:00,913
WONDERFUL NEWS.

896
00:52:00,996 --> 00:52:04,208
WE HAVE RECEIVED A ROYAL
INVITATION TO A BALL

897
00:52:04,291 --> 00:52:07,044
IN HONOR OF HIS ROYAL
HIGHNESS, THE PRINCE!

898
00:52:07,127 --> 00:52:08,212
OH, MAMA, BUT--

899
00:52:08,254 --> 00:52:09,713
NOW, NOW, NOW,
CAREFUL, CAREFUL.

900
00:52:09,797 --> 00:52:10,714
YOU MIGHT TEAR IT,

901
00:52:10,756 --> 00:52:12,883
AND I WANT
TO HAVE IT FRAMED.

902
00:52:12,967 --> 00:52:14,385
OH, I THINK
IT'S SO EXCITING,

903
00:52:14,468 --> 00:52:15,719
I SHALL HAVE THE VAPORS!

904
00:52:15,761 --> 00:52:17,263
HOW SHALL I HAVE
MY HAIR?

905
00:52:17,346 --> 00:52:18,264
OH, WHAT SHALL I WEAR?

906
00:52:18,347 --> 00:52:19,556
THERE IS WORK
TO BE DONE.

907
00:52:19,640 --> 00:52:21,767
WE HAVE NOT
A MOMENT TO LOSE.

908
00:52:21,809 --> 00:52:23,435
WHAT CAN WE WEAR?!

909
00:52:23,477 --> 00:52:25,062
WE'LL HAVE TO HAVE
SOMETHING NEW.

910
00:52:25,104 --> 00:52:27,398
YES. I MEAN, NONE OF MY
THINGS ARE POSSIBLE.

911
00:52:27,439 --> 00:52:29,984
LET US GO AND SEE.

912
00:52:30,067 --> 00:52:32,403
OH! CAN YOU NEVER DO
A JOB PROPERLY, GIRL?

913
00:52:32,444 --> 00:52:33,904
LOOK AT ALL THAT DIRTY WATER.

914
00:52:33,988 --> 00:52:36,865
YOU HAD BETTER DO
THE WHOLE STAIRCASE AGAIN!

915
00:52:36,907 --> 00:52:38,158
COME, GIRLS!

916
00:52:38,242 --> 00:52:40,911
MAMA I THINK PALATINE
SHOULD WEAR A BROWN DRESS.

917
00:52:40,995 --> 00:52:42,246
Palatine:
YOU SPITEFUL CREATURE!

918
00:52:42,329 --> 00:52:44,415
YOU SHOULD WEAR GREEN
TO MATCH YOUR COMPLEXION.

919
00:52:44,456 --> 00:52:45,666
Isobella: OH, MAMA!

920
00:52:45,749 --> 00:52:47,960
BUT THE PRESTIGE, YOUR ROYAL
HIGHNESS, THE PRESTIGE!

921
00:52:48,002 --> 00:52:49,503
IT WILL PUT
EUPHRANIA ON THE MAP.

922
00:52:49,545 --> 00:52:51,255
UH, PIN THERE, IDIOT.

923
00:52:51,297 --> 00:52:54,091
NOT THERE, THERE.

924
00:52:54,174 --> 00:52:55,926
EXCUSE ME,
YOUR ROYAL HIGHNESS.

925
00:52:56,010 --> 00:52:58,596
FINE, FINE, FINE.
ENOUGH'S ENOUGH.

926
00:52:58,637 --> 00:53:01,432
I'M DELIGHTED.
YOU'VE DONE VERY WELL.

927
00:53:01,473 --> 00:53:03,267
NOW LEAVE US, PLEASE.

928
00:53:10,274 --> 00:53:11,901
OH, JOHN!

929
00:53:13,569 --> 00:53:15,696
WHAT HAVE
I LET MYSELF IN FOR?

930
00:53:15,779 --> 00:53:18,574
A LITTLE MORE
POMP AND CIRCUMSTANCE.

931
00:53:18,616 --> 00:53:20,200
AND WHO KNOWS?

932
00:53:20,284 --> 00:53:21,945
PERHAPS THERE WILL BE ONE TO
WHOM YOU CAN GIVE YOUR HEART.

933
00:53:22,036 --> 00:53:24,496
WILL YOU DANCE
WITH YOUR LADY CAROLINE?

934
00:53:24,538 --> 00:53:25,789
ALAS, NOT DONE, SIR.

935
00:53:25,873 --> 00:53:28,500
OH, YES, HOW STUPID OF ME.
I WAS FORGETTING.

936
00:53:28,542 --> 00:53:30,669
NOT IN 20 YEARS!

937
00:53:30,711 --> 00:53:31,795
WE'RE SOLD OUT!

938
00:53:31,879 --> 00:53:33,172
MY CHOICEST BROCADES!

939
00:53:33,213 --> 00:53:34,298
Stepmother: SOLD OUT?

940
00:53:34,381 --> 00:53:36,842
WHAT DO YOU MEAN,
YOU RIDICULOUS MAN?

941
00:53:36,884 --> 00:53:38,177
HOW CAN YOU BE SOLD OUT

942
00:53:38,218 --> 00:53:39,595
WHEN WE HAVE NOT
PURCHASED ANYTHING?

943
00:53:39,678 --> 00:53:41,555
THE BALL, GRACIOUS LADY.

944
00:53:41,639 --> 00:53:43,974
I'D SCARCELY OPENED ME DOORS THIS
MORNING WHEN THEY DESCENDED!

945
00:53:44,058 --> 00:53:45,809
WHO? WHO DESCENDED?

946
00:53:45,851 --> 00:53:47,811
EVERYBODY, MI LADY !

947
00:53:47,895 --> 00:53:50,147
THEY CAME LIKE
THE HERON TO THE POOL,

948
00:53:50,231 --> 00:53:51,315
TAKING EVERYTHING I HAD.

949
00:53:51,398 --> 00:53:53,859
I HAVE NEVER HEARD
OF SUCH A THING.

950
00:53:53,901 --> 00:53:56,528
YOU, MY GOOD MAN, SHOULD
LEARN TO DISTINGUISH

951
00:53:56,570 --> 00:53:59,406
BETWEEN RIFFRAFF AND PEOPLE
OF CONSEQUENCE, LIKE US.

952
00:53:59,448 --> 00:54:01,450
WHAT SHALL WE DO?

953
00:54:01,533 --> 00:54:02,826
Stepmother:
COACHMAN, DRIVE US HOME.

954
00:54:02,910 --> 00:54:05,246
GIRLS, DO STOP PULLING
THOSE DREADFUL FACES.

955
00:54:05,329 --> 00:54:07,748
I'M IN A BAD ENOUGH
MOOD AS IT IS.

956
00:54:07,790 --> 00:54:08,832
IDIOT!

957
00:54:11,043 --> 00:54:13,963
Palatine: OH, MAMA,
SHE'S SO BEASTLY TO ME!

958
00:54:14,046 --> 00:54:16,131
CINDERELLA!

959
00:54:16,173 --> 00:54:20,678
CINDERELLA! WHERE IS
THAT WRETCHED GIRL?

960
00:54:20,719 --> 00:54:23,305
WHY DO YOU NOT COME
WHEN I CALL YOU?

961
00:54:23,389 --> 00:54:25,808
COME OVER HERE. I HAVE
A JOB FOR YOU TO DO.

962
00:54:25,891 --> 00:54:30,854
TAKE THESE, UNPICK THEM, AND MAKE 3
SPLENDID NEW DRESSES OUT OF THEM.

963
00:54:30,938 --> 00:54:33,524
OH, MAMA, YOU'RE SO CLEVER.

964
00:54:33,566 --> 00:54:36,819
MAKE SURE THEY FIT
TO PERFECTION.

965
00:54:36,902 --> 00:54:37,820
NOW START IMMEDIATELY.

966
00:54:37,903 --> 00:54:40,155
THERE'S NOT A MOMENT
TO LOSE.

967
00:54:40,239 --> 00:54:42,783
BE SURE YOUR HANDS ARE CLEAN
BEFORE YOU START SEWING.

968
00:54:42,825 --> 00:54:45,327
AND WE'RE TO LOOK
AS PRETTY AS POSSIBLE.

969
00:54:45,411 --> 00:54:47,580
AH, WELL, AS PRETTY
AS WE ARE!

970
00:54:47,621 --> 00:54:53,002
WE MUST ALL BE
UTTERLY SPLENDID.

971
00:54:53,085 --> 00:54:55,504
SO RUN ALONG, CHILD.
START AT ONCE!

972
00:54:56,755 --> 00:54:59,049
YES...

973
00:55:01,010 --> 00:55:05,598
UTTERLY... SPLENDID!

974
00:55:24,825 --> 00:55:29,038
BUT ALREADY,
HIS HEART WAS--

975
00:55:29,121 --> 00:55:32,291
OH, HENRIETTA,
no STOP GRUMBLING.

976
00:55:32,333 --> 00:55:38,130
HIS HEART WAS
BURNING WITH... LOVE

977
00:55:38,172 --> 00:55:43,969
AS IF IT HAD BEEN LAID
ON RED HOT GOALS!

978
00:55:44,053 --> 00:55:47,806
YOU LIKE THAT?
So DO I.

979
00:55:47,848 --> 00:55:50,309
SIT DOWN, DEAR.
DON'T DO THAT.

980
00:55:50,351 --> 00:55:55,147
AT THIS POINT, SCHEHERAZADE
SAW THE APPROACH OF MORNING

981
00:55:55,189 --> 00:55:58,984
AND FELL SILENT.

982
00:55:59,068 --> 00:56:00,945
AS WELL SHE MIGHT.

983
00:56:02,488 --> 00:56:05,199
NOW LOOK WHAT YOU'VE DONE,
SET YOUR FRIENDS OFF.

984
00:56:05,282 --> 00:56:09,620
I SUPPOSE YOU WANT FEEDING.

985
00:56:09,703 --> 00:56:11,330
NO REST, NO PEACE.

986
00:56:13,707 --> 00:56:16,752
WELL... SEE IF YOU LIKE THIS.

987
00:56:17,836 --> 00:56:19,463
YOU'LL FALL.

988
00:56:19,546 --> 00:56:23,050
HANSEL, GRETEL...

989
00:56:24,843 --> 00:56:27,263
IS THAT
THE WRONG WAY ROUND?

990
00:56:28,347 --> 00:56:29,265
WHO'S THAT?

991
00:56:29,348 --> 00:56:32,643
OH, IT'S YOU, IS IT?

992
00:56:32,685 --> 00:56:36,146
OH, DON'T WIPE
YOUR PAWS, WILL YOU!

993
00:56:36,230 --> 00:56:37,815
I'VE GOT NOBODY TO HELP
ME CLEAN, YOU KNOW.

994
00:56:37,856 --> 00:56:40,734
I HAVE TO DO ALL MYSELF.

995
00:56:40,776 --> 00:56:48,492
DO YOU REALIZE THAT TIRESOME SCHEHERAZADE
IS BARELY HALFWAY THROUGH HER 1,001 NIGHTS?

996
00:56:48,576 --> 00:56:53,455
I HAVE TO THINK OF ANOTHER
496 TALES BEFORE SHE'S SAFE.

997
00:56:53,539 --> 00:56:56,250
AND M'! DIARY IS CHOCK-A-BLOCK.

998
00:56:56,333 --> 00:57:00,588
LOOK! WEDNESDAY, A SEA JOURNEY TO
TAKE CARE OF A LITTLE MERMAID.

999
00:57:00,629 --> 00:57:04,758
FRIDAY... OH, THE UGLY
DUCKLING'S DUE TO HATCH.

1000
00:57:04,842 --> 00:57:06,135
WELL, I HAVE TO BE
BACK FOR THAT.

1001
00:57:06,176 --> 00:57:09,096
OH, DO BE QUIET, HENRIETTA.
I CAN'T THINK!

1002
00:57:09,138 --> 00:57:10,889
NOW, WHAT'S THAT?

1003
00:57:10,931 --> 00:57:16,478
AH! A NEW KEY CUT
FOR PANDORA' S BOX.

1004
00:57:16,562 --> 00:57:19,148
WELL, IT'S ALL VERY WELL
FOR HANS CHRISTIAN ANDERSEN

1005
00:57:19,189 --> 00:57:21,609
TO SAY HIS LIFE
IS A FAIRY STORY.

1006
00:57:21,650 --> 00:57:22,568
MINE ISN'T.

1007
00:57:22,610 --> 00:57:25,154
NOTHING! ONE LONG SLOG!

1008
00:57:25,237 --> 00:57:29,283
I CAN DO ALL MANNER OF THINGS
FOR OTHER PEOPLE,

1009
00:57:29,366 --> 00:57:31,493
BUT NEVER ANYTHING FOR MYSELF.

1010
00:57:31,535 --> 00:57:33,412
WATCH! YOU'D LIKE A BONE.

1011
00:57:33,454 --> 00:57:36,040
SIMPLE. THERE YOU ARE.

1012
00:57:36,123 --> 00:57:38,459
LET ME TRY IT FOR MYSELF.

1013
00:57:38,542 --> 00:57:40,127
WOULD I LIKE A CUP OF TEA?

1014
00:57:40,169 --> 00:57:42,129
YES, I WOULD.
THANK YOU VERY MUCH.

1015
00:57:42,212 --> 00:57:43,714
NOW WATCH THIS.

1016
00:57:43,797 --> 00:57:45,591
KETTLE, BOIL.

1017
00:57:45,633 --> 00:57:47,968
SEE? DISASTER.

1018
00:57:48,093 --> 00:57:51,305
NOW, WHAT'S HAPPENED
TO CINDERELLA?

1019
00:58:22,002 --> 00:58:24,964
HOW FUNNY.

1020
00:58:25,005 --> 00:58:25,965
I WAS JUST WISHING--

1021
00:58:26,006 --> 00:58:28,008
YES. I KNOW.

1022
00:58:29,510 --> 00:58:32,513
DO YOU MIND IF I MAKE
A VERY RUDE COMMENT?

1023
00:58:33,514 --> 00:58:35,516
THESE ARE HOPELESS.

1024
00:58:37,017 --> 00:58:39,228
THEY'RE WORSE
THAN HOPELESS.

1025
00:58:40,854 --> 00:58:42,773
I'VE RUINED THEM.

1026
00:58:42,856 --> 00:58:44,608
I'M GOING TO GET
INTO SUCH TROUBLE.

1027
00:58:44,692 --> 00:58:47,486
NOW, WE DON'T WANT
ANY OF THAT.

1028
00:58:47,528 --> 00:58:50,823
DRY YOUR TEARS
AND HAVE SOMETHING TO EAT.

1029
00:58:50,864 --> 00:58:53,659
HMM. YOU LOOK
HALF-STARVED AND WORN OUT.

1030
00:58:53,701 --> 00:58:56,287
I'M AFRAID THERE ISN'T
ANYTHING TO EAT.

1031
00:58:56,370 --> 00:58:58,831
I WAS TOO BUSY DOING
THOSE TO COOK ANYTHING.

1032
00:58:58,872 --> 00:59:00,374
WHAT'S THAT, THEN?

1033
00:59:04,503 --> 00:59:05,879
WHERE DID THAT
COME FROM?

1034
00:59:05,921 --> 00:59:08,173
AND WHERE DID
YOU COME FROM?

1035
00:59:09,508 --> 00:59:10,801
I DON' T UNDERSTAND.

1036
00:59:10,884 --> 00:59:14,263
NO. WELL, VERY FEW PEOPLE DO.

1037
00:59:14,346 --> 00:59:16,265
YOU'RE NOT MEANT
TO UNDERSTAND IT.

1038
00:59:16,348 --> 00:59:19,268
YOU'RE MEANT
TO ACCEPT IT GRACIOUSLY.

1039
00:59:19,351 --> 00:59:21,604
NOW, LOOK.
I'M A VERY BUSY WOMAN,

1040
00:59:21,687 --> 00:59:25,524
AND I SOMETIMES--
SOMETIMES LACK TACT.

1041
00:59:25,566 --> 00:59:28,944
THE FIRST THING YOU MUST LEARN IN
LIFE IS NEVER TO GO BY APPEARANCES.

1042
00:59:29,028 --> 00:59:33,782
THINGS ARE NEVER QUITE
WHAT YOU THINK THEY ARE.

1043
00:59:33,866 --> 00:59:36,368
DO EAT UP; THAT'S
ONE OF MY BEST RECIPES.

1044
00:59:38,203 --> 00:59:40,080
TAKE ME, FOR EXAMPLE.

1045
00:59:40,164 --> 00:59:42,124
I'M NOT WHAT I SEEM.

1046
00:59:42,207 --> 00:59:44,126
MIND YOU, I DON'T
DRESS THE PART

1047
00:59:44,209 --> 00:59:45,628
AND FOR VERY GOOD REASON.

1048
00:59:45,711 --> 00:59:48,255
HUMAN NATURE--OH, WELL,

1049
00:59:48,297 --> 00:59:50,716
WE WON'T GO INTO WHAT
I THINK OF HUMAN NATURE,

1050
00:59:50,758 --> 00:59:54,470
BUT IF I WERE TO Go ABOUT MY
BUSINESS ALL SPARKLE AND GLITTER,

1051
00:59:54,553 --> 00:59:56,639
QUITE APART
FROM LOOKING ABSURD"

1052
00:59:56,722 --> 00:59:59,141
BECAUSE DESPITE WHAT THEY WRITE
IN THOSE STORYBOOKS FOR CHILDREN,

1053
00:59:59,224 --> 01:00:01,977
IT'S A MOST UNSUITABLE
COSTUME FOR A GROWN WOMAN--

1054
01:00:02,061 --> 01:00:04,146
I SHOULD NEVER BE ABLE TO SORT OUT
THE WORTHY FROM THE UNWORTHY.

1055
01:00:04,188 --> 01:00:05,231
DON' T YOU AGREE?

1056
01:00:05,272 --> 01:00:07,858
I'M NOT SURE I KNOW
WHAT YOU'RE TALKING ABOUT.

1057
01:00:10,069 --> 01:00:13,364
I'M A... FAIRY GODMOTHER.

1058
01:00:13,405 --> 01:00:14,490
HAVE BEEN ALL MY LIFE.

1059
01:00:14,573 --> 01:00:18,160
AND PLEASE DON'T ASK
HOW I GOT INTO IT,

1060
01:00:18,244 --> 01:00:19,995
BECAUSE IT'S A LONG STORY.

1061
01:00:20,079 --> 01:00:21,997
HIGHLY IMPROBABLE...

1062
01:00:22,081 --> 01:00:25,251
AND I SOMETIMES WISH
WE'D NEVER BEEN INVENTED.

1063
01:00:25,292 --> 01:00:26,252
ARE THERE MANY OF YOU?

1064
01:00:26,293 --> 01:00:27,336
NOT ENOUGH TO GO ROUND,

1065
01:00:27,378 --> 01:00:30,673
JUDGING BY THE AMOUNT
OF WORK I HAVE TO DO.

1066
01:00:30,756 --> 01:00:32,508
HOW DO YOU LIKE THAT?

1067
01:00:32,591 --> 01:00:34,176
DELICIOUS.

1068
01:00:34,260 --> 01:00:36,345
IT'S THE SAUCE, YOU KNOW.

1069
01:00:36,428 --> 01:00:38,180
THAT OLD WIZARD MICHELIN
GAVE ME THE SECRET

1070
01:00:38,264 --> 01:00:42,059
IN RETURN FOR 3 OF MY MAGIC
KNIVES AND FORKS. WHERE WAS I?

1071
01:00:42,101 --> 01:00:46,188
YES! WELL, I HAVE
TO PUT PEOPLE TO THE TEST.

1072
01:00:46,272 --> 01:00:47,690
NOW, YOU PASSED THE TEST.

1073
01:00:47,773 --> 01:00:54,488
THOSE-THAT UNHOLY TRIO UPSTAIRS
I SIMPLY DIDN'T BOTHER WITH.

1074
01:00:54,572 --> 01:00:56,865
NOT WORTH THE EFFORT.

1075
01:00:56,949 --> 01:00:59,535
HOWEVER, TO WORK.

1076
01:00:59,577 --> 01:01:02,204
BEST THAT YOU CAN DO
IS GET A GOOD NIGHTS REST.

1077
01:01:06,709 --> 01:01:08,168
NO'! YOU.

1078
01:01:08,210 --> 01:01:11,005
I DIDN'T INCLUDE YOU.
YOU'VE GOT WORK TO DO.

1079
01:01:16,552 --> 01:01:17,928
WM.

1080
01:01:19,388 --> 01:01:22,391
AH. LET ME CONCENTRATE.

1081
01:01:27,521 --> 01:01:30,983
WHAT ARE THEY WEARING
IN PARIS THESE DAYS?

1082
01:01:31,066 --> 01:01:33,652
I CAN'T KEEP UP
WITH FASHION.

1083
01:01:33,694 --> 01:01:36,697
WELL, HAVE YOU GOT
ANY IDEAS?

1084
01:01:37,907 --> 01:01:41,577
OH, CONCENTRATE.
CONCENTRATE.

1085
01:02:06,227 --> 01:02:09,813
Stepmother: OF COURSE,
IT IS NOT WHAT I AM USED TO,

1086
01:02:09,855 --> 01:02:13,484
BUT I MUST SAY, YOU HAVE MADE A
REASONABLE JOB OF STITCHING THIS.

1087
01:02:13,567 --> 01:02:16,403
Palatine: I'M MAM'SA FAVORITE,
AND SHE PROMISED ME FIRST.

1088
01:02:16,487 --> 01:02:17,988
GIRLS, IT IS
TIME TO LEAVE!

1089
01:02:18,072 --> 01:02:20,324
WE MUST NOT KEEP
THE PRINCE WAITING.

1090
01:02:21,575 --> 01:02:23,494
MAMA, I'VE JUST BEEN
TELLING PALATINE

1091
01:02:23,577 --> 01:02:25,996
THAT SHE'S NOT TO
FEEL JEALOUS

1092
01:02:26,080 --> 01:02:28,540
IF THE PRINCE ASKS
ME TO DANCE FIRST.

1093
01:02:28,582 --> 01:02:29,667
OH, MAMA!

1094
01:02:29,708 --> 01:02:30,834
SHH.

1095
01:02:30,918 --> 01:02:32,294
CINDERELLA,
STRAIGHTEN THAT HEM.

1096
01:02:32,378 --> 01:02:34,380
Palatine: HOW DO
I LOOK, MAMA?

1097
01:02:34,463 --> 01:02:36,340
DON'T I LOOK SUPERB?

1098
01:02:36,382 --> 01:02:38,050
YOU BOTH LOOK
RAVISHING.

1099
01:02:38,133 --> 01:02:41,845
IT WILL BE DIFFICULT FOR YOUR
POOR MAMA TO OUTSHINE YOU.

1100
01:02:43,597 --> 01:02:45,349
WELL!

1101
01:02:45,432 --> 01:02:48,894
COME, LET US DEPART.

1102
01:02:54,066 --> 01:02:56,652
CLEAR UP THE MESS IN MY
BEDROOM, CINDERELLA.

1103
01:02:56,735 --> 01:03:00,698
I DO NOT WANT TO COME HOME
AND FIND IT ALL UNTIDY.

1104
01:03:04,535 --> 01:03:05,786
Cinderella:
HAVE A NICE TIME.

1105
01:03:05,869 --> 01:03:07,788
Stepmother: YOU MAY
DEPEND ON THAT!

1106
01:03:07,871 --> 01:03:09,832
Palatine: OH, MAMA,
WE LOOK WONDERFUL.

1107
01:03:09,873 --> 01:03:11,125
Isabella: WELL, I DO.

1108
01:03:11,208 --> 01:03:12,585
Stepmother:
COME, GIRLS.

1109
01:03:54,293 --> 01:03:55,669
Man: YOUR ROYAL HIGHNESS,

1110
01:03:55,753 --> 01:03:59,006
MY LORDS,
LADIES AND GENTLEMEN.

1111
01:03:59,089 --> 01:04:04,553
HER SERENE HIGHNESS
THE PRINCESS MARIA OF TUSCANY.

1112
01:04:09,850 --> 01:04:14,897
THE GRAND DUCHESS SOFIA
ELIZABETH OF DIETRICHSTEIN.

1113
01:04:17,024 --> 01:04:22,238
HER IMPERIAL HIGHNESS
PRINCESS ALEXANDRE.

1114
01:04:44,551 --> 01:04:46,178
OH, WHY NOT?

1115
01:04:46,220 --> 01:04:48,597
I'LL JUST MAKE TIME.

1116
01:04:53,060 --> 01:04:56,021
YES. YES,
JUST AS I THOUGHT.

1117
01:04:56,063 --> 01:04:59,149
SITTING ALL ALONE FEELING
SORRY FOR OURSELVES, ARE WE?

1118
01:04:59,233 --> 01:05:01,944
WELL, THAT'S
UNDERSTANDABLE, I SUPPOSE,

1119
01:05:02,027 --> 01:05:05,114
THOUGH I NEVER CARED MUCH FOR
THESE ROYAL OCCASIONS MYSELF--

1120
01:05:05,197 --> 01:05:07,616
TOO FORMAL, AND NOT
ENOUGH TO EAT OR DRINK.

1121
01:05:07,700 --> 01:05:11,787
STILL, I DARESAY IN YOUR HEART
OF HEARTS YOU'D LIKE TO GO.

1122
01:05:11,870 --> 01:05:13,122
GO?

1123
01:05:13,163 --> 01:05:14,790
ME Go TO THE BALL?

1124
01:05:14,873 --> 01:05:16,166
WELL, OF COURSE.

1125
01:05:16,208 --> 01:05:18,961
THAT WHAT YOU WERE
WISHING, ISN'T IT?

1126
01:05:19,044 --> 01:05:20,921
NOT WISHING,
EXACTLY,

1127
01:05:21,046 --> 01:05:23,257
BUT THINKING WHAT
IT MUST BE LIKE.

1128
01:05:23,340 --> 01:05:24,717
SAME THING.

1129
01:05:24,800 --> 01:05:28,012
NOW, LISTEN. I HAVEN'T GOT
A GREAT DEAL OF TIME,

1130
01:05:28,095 --> 01:05:31,473
BECAUSE I'M SIMPLY RUN
OFF MY FEET THESE DAYS--

1131
01:05:31,557 --> 01:05:33,809
WHAT A
MISERABLE FIRE.

1132
01:05:36,562 --> 01:05:37,938
YOU SHALL Go
TO THE BALL.

1133
01:05:38,022 --> 01:05:39,982
I JUST HOPE I HAVEN'T
STRETCHED EVERYTHING TOO FAR

1134
01:05:40,065 --> 01:05:41,525
AND THAT I CAN
MAKE IT WORK.

1135
01:05:41,567 --> 01:05:43,444
MY POWERS ARE NOT
UNLIMITED, YOU KNOW.

1136
01:05:43,569 --> 01:05:44,820
NO, I DIDN'T KNOW.

1137
01:05:44,904 --> 01:05:46,530
OH, I HAVE TO
SHARE THEM OUT.

1138
01:05:46,572 --> 01:05:48,908
NOW, LET ME THINK.

1139
01:05:50,868 --> 01:05:54,997
YES, I CAN BORROW
A BIT UNTIL MIDNIGHT.

1140
01:05:55,080 --> 01:05:56,832
RIGHT.

1141
01:05:56,916 --> 01:05:58,918
NOW.

1142
01:06:00,461 --> 01:06:01,670
YOU !

1143
01:06:01,754 --> 01:06:03,505
OUTSIDE.

1144
01:06:05,174 --> 01:06:09,053
HEY, I SHALL NEED YOU,
So OFF YOU Go.

1145
01:06:11,847 --> 01:06:13,641
OH, AND YOU.

1146
01:06:13,682 --> 01:06:15,351
TAKE THEM WITH YOU, DOG,

1147
01:06:15,434 --> 01:06:18,896
AND SEE IF YOU CAN ROUND UP
A FROG OR A LIZARD.

1148
01:06:18,979 --> 01:06:22,191
NOW, THEN, I MUST DO
SOMETHING ABOUT YOU.

1149
01:06:28,489 --> 01:06:31,325
IT DOESN'T
ALWAYS WORK, THIS,

1150
01:06:31,367 --> 01:06:34,203
BUT THEN,
I HAVE BEEN LUCKY.

1151
01:06:36,205 --> 01:06:38,499
OH, DEAR.

1152
01:06:47,549 --> 01:06:49,885
OH, DEAR!

1153
01:06:51,387 --> 01:06:55,140
MOST UNSUITABLE
FOR A BALL.

1154
01:06:55,224 --> 01:06:56,517
YES.

1155
01:06:56,559 --> 01:06:58,852
YES, IT IS.

1156
01:06:58,894 --> 01:07:02,147
WELL, YOU'LL JUST HAVE
TO Go AS YOU ARE.

1157
01:07:13,325 --> 01:07:16,161
OH, IT'S BEAUTIFUL!

HOW DO YOU DO IT?

1160

01:17:19,890 --> 01:17:22,309
WHO IS SHE?

1246
01:20:58,609 --> 01:20:59,860
WHO CAN SHE BE?

1247
01:20:59,944 --> 01:21:01,528
I'VE No IDEA,
YOUR MAJESTY.

1248
01:21:01,612 --> 01:21:03,239
SHE'S NOT
ON MY LIST.

1249
01:21:03,280 --> 01:21:04,907
YOUR LIST,
YOUR LIST.

1250
01:21:06,450 --> 01:21:08,577
YOUR LIST. FIND
OUT, MAN. FIND OUT.

1251
01:21:08,619 --> 01:21:09,745
YES, SIR.

1252
01:21:09,787 --> 01:21:12,957
I DIDN'T QUITE
CATCH THE NAME.

1253
01:21:12,998 --> 01:21:14,416
NO, MOTHER.
NONE OF US DID.

1254
01:21:14,458 --> 01:21:16,961
MOST IRREGULAR.

1255
01:21:17,044 --> 01:21:20,714
PLAY ON.
PLAY ON.

1256
01:21:23,300 --> 01:21:25,094
I THINK...

1257
01:21:25,135 --> 01:21:30,099
I THINK I SHOULD EXPLAIN WHY
I'M HERE, YOUR ROYAL HIGHNESS.

1258
01:21:30,140 --> 01:21:33,310
MY EYES GIVE ME
ENOUGH REASONS.

1259
01:21:34,812 --> 01:21:36,564
MY NAME IS EDWARD,

1260
01:21:36,647 --> 01:21:39,942
AND IT IS FOR ME TO
EXPLAIN MYSELF TO YOU,

1261
01:21:39,984 --> 01:21:41,569
EXPLAIN WHY
I SUBJECTED YOU

1262
01:21:41,652 --> 01:21:43,487
TO THIS
RIDICULOUS CHARADE.

1263
01:21:45,656 --> 01:21:50,119
I'M SURE I SEEM TO YOU
THE MASTER OF MY FATE,

1264
01:21:50,160 --> 01:21:53,205
BUT UNTIL
THIS MOMENT,

1265
01:21:53,289 --> 01:21:57,918
I'VE BEEN A PRISONER
TRAPPED BY MY BIRTHRIGHT.

1266
01:21:57,960 --> 01:21:58,877
TRAPPED?

1267
01:21:58,961 --> 01:22:00,129
YES.

1268
01:22:00,170 --> 01:22:03,257
IT WAS NEVER MY INCLINATION
TO BEHAVE LIKE THIS.

1269
01:22:04,758 --> 01:22:06,260
WHAT I MEAN IS...

1270
01:22:09,138 --> 01:22:11,473
AND I'M NOT SAYING
IT VERY WELL...

1271
01:22:12,975 --> 01:22:16,395
I HAVE ALWAYS BELIEVED
THAT MARRIAGE...

1272
01:22:16,478 --> 01:22:18,731
SHOULD BEGIN WITH LOVE.

1273
01:22:18,814 --> 01:22:20,107
I'M SURE YOU AGREE.

1274
01:22:20,149 --> 01:22:23,402
I HAVE NEVER GIVEN
THE MATTER MUCH THOUGHT.

1275
01:22:27,656 --> 01:22:30,993
I'M AMAZED YOU EVEN ACCEPTED
THE INVITATION TO THE BALL.

1276
01:22:32,494 --> 01:22:34,079
YES.

1277
01:22:34,163 --> 01:22:37,416
I WAS A LITTLE
AMAZED MYSELF.

1278
01:22:37,499 --> 01:22:39,126
DIDN'T YOU
THINK IT ODD?

1279
01:22:40,669 --> 01:22:42,087
I SUPPOSE I DID.

1280
01:22:42,129 --> 01:22:45,007
BUT... YOU STILL CAME.

1281
01:22:46,508 --> 01:22:47,843
WHY?

1282
01:22:49,470 --> 01:22:50,763
MUST YOU
ASK THAT?

1283
01:22:50,846 --> 01:22:52,139
YES, I MUST.

1284
01:22:56,352 --> 01:22:58,229
I HAD HEARD
MUCH OF YOU.

1285
01:22:58,270 --> 01:22:59,521
GOOD OR BAD?

1286
01:22:59,563 --> 01:23:00,856
OH, NOTHING
BUT GOOD.

1287
01:23:00,940 --> 01:23:02,191
I CAN'T THINK HOW.

1288
01:23:02,233 --> 01:23:05,236
IF I WERE YOU, I'D HAVE
BELIEVED THE WORST.

1289
01:23:05,277 --> 01:23:06,862
YOU SEE,
I WAS EXPECTING--

1290
01:23:06,904 --> 01:23:09,531
I CAN'T TELL YOU
WHAT I WAS EXPECTING.

1291
01:23:09,573 --> 01:23:12,201
BUT WHATEVER
HAPPENS AFTERWARDS,

1292
01:23:12,243 --> 01:23:15,579
I SHALL ALWAYS REMEMBER
THIS MOMENT.

1293
01:23:15,621 --> 01:23:20,084
AND YOU MUST TAKE MY PRESENT
HAPPINESS TO MAKE YOU HAPPIER.

1294
01:23:20,125 --> 01:23:23,212
TAKE IT...
WITH ALL MY HEART,

1295
01:23:23,295 --> 01:23:26,465
FOR I GIVE IT WITH
ALL MY HEART.

1296
01:23:27,800 --> 01:23:35,641
THERE'S A SECRET KINGDOM
ALL MY OWN

1297
01:23:35,683 --> 01:23:43,190
WITH No CASTLES AND No
VASSALS AND NO THRONE

1298
01:23:43,274 --> 01:23:47,444
JUST TWO SUBJECTS,
YOU AND ME

1299
01:23:47,528 --> 01:23:51,907
IN MY PRIVATE
MONARCHY

1300
01:23:51,949 --> 01:23:59,665
WHERE THE KING IS LOVE
AND LOVE ALONE

1301
01:23:59,748 --> 01:24:07,423
IN THAT SECRET
KINGDOM THAT YOU SEE

1302
01:24:07,464 --> 01:24:15,347
SHOULD THE MAKE-BELIEVE
BECOME REALITY

1303
01:24:15,389 --> 01:24:19,435
WITH No SCEPTER
IN YOUR HAND

1304
01:24:19,476 --> 01:24:23,731
No DOMINION
TO COMMAND

1305
01:24:23,814 --> 01:24:31,947
WOULD YOU BE CONTENT
WITH ONLY ME?

1306
01:24:31,989 --> 01:24:38,537
WHAT IS A SONG
THAT'S NEVER SUNG?

1307
01:24:38,621 --> 01:24:44,460
WHAT IS A HEART THAT'S NEVER
THRILLED TO BE YOUNG?

1308
01:24:44,501 --> 01:24:50,883
WHAT IS A DREAM THAT
CAN'T COME TRUE?

1309
01:24:50,966 --> 01:24:55,971
WHAT IS MY LIFE TO ME
WITHOUT M'! LOVE FOR YOU?

1310
01:25:01,727 --> 01:25:09,652
IF THAT SECRET KINGDOM'S
OURS TO SHARE

1311
01:25:09,693 --> 01:25:18,994
I COULD NEVER WISH FOR
MORE, FOR YOU'D BE THERE

1312
01:25:19,036 --> 01:25:23,749
JUST TWO SUBJECTS,
YOU AND ME

1313
01:25:23,832 --> 01:25:28,462
IN OUR PRIVATE
MONARCHY

1314
01:25:28,545 --> 01:25:33,425
ALL ALONE TOGETHER

1315
01:25:33,509 --> 01:25:39,014
WE WOULD LOVE FOREVER

1316
01:25:39,056 --> 01:25:44,061
IN OUR SECRET KINGDOM
FAR AWAY SOMEWHERE

1317
01:26:10,754 --> 01:26:11,839
AHEM.

1318
01:26:11,881 --> 01:26:14,592
YOUR ROYAL
HIGHNESS?

1319
01:26:19,179 --> 01:26:20,681
YES? WHAT IS IT?

1320
01:26:20,764 --> 01:26:22,850
HIS MAJESTY
REQUESTS AN AUDIENCE

1321
01:26:22,933 --> 01:26:25,728
WITH THE PRINCESS
INCOGNITA.

1322
01:26:28,814 --> 01:26:31,066
Edward: PLEASE
TELL MY FATHER

1323
01:26:31,108 --> 01:26:35,154
WE'LL BE HAPPY TO
GRANT HIS REQUEST.

1324
01:26:43,954 --> 01:26:45,998
YOU FRIGHTENED HER,
YOU FOOL!

1325
01:27:45,266 --> 01:27:46,725
WAIT !

1326
01:27:46,809 --> 01:27:48,310
COME BACK!

1327
01:28:02,116 --> 01:28:03,367
COME BACK.

1328
01:28:20,009 --> 01:28:27,349
RAINBOWS RACED
AROUND THE ROOM

1329
01:28:27,391 --> 01:28:33,856
WHEN HE DANCED
WITH ME

1330
01:28:33,939 --> 01:28:38,193
SHOOTING STARS
BEGAN TO ZOOM

1331
01:28:38,235 --> 01:28:42,907
WHEN HE DANCED
WITH ME

1332
01:28:42,990 --> 01:28:46,660
IN HIS ARMS
I WAS ASCENDING

1333
01:28:46,744 --> 01:28:50,873
MY WORLD BECAME
A MAGIC BLENDING

1334
01:28:50,915 --> 01:28:53,918
OF DREAMS
AND HOPES AND LOVE

1335
01:28:53,959 --> 01:28:59,757
WHEN HE DANCED
WITH ME

1336
01:28:59,798 --> 01:29:08,182
THOUGH THIS LOVELY NIGHT WAS
ONLY A FANTASY

1337
01:29:08,265 --> 01:29:17,024
AND I KNOW TONIGHT IS
ALL THERE WILL EVER BE

1338
01:29:17,066 --> 01:29:22,571
DANCING
IN HIS ARMS FOREVER

1339
01:29:22,613 --> 01:29:28,827
MY HEART
WILL NEVER BE FREE

1340
01:29:28,911 --> 01:29:36,335
'DREAMING OF THE NIGHT
HE DANCED WITH ME

1341
01:30:12,496 --> 01:30:17,084
RAINBOWS RACED
AROUND THE ROOM

1342
01:30:17,126 --> 01:30:22,840
WHEN SHE DANCED
WITH ME

1343
01:30:22,882 --> 01:30:27,177
SHOOTING STARS
BEGAN TO ZOOM

1344
01:30:27,261 --> 01:30:32,933
WHEN SHE DANCED
WITH ME

1345
01:30:33,017 --> 01:30:37,855
IN HER ARMS
I WAS ASCENDING

1346
01:30:37,897 --> 01:30:42,860
AT LAST I SAW
THAT PERFECT BLENDING

1347
01:30:42,902 --> 01:30:46,739
OF DREAMS
AND HOPES AND LOVE

1348
01:30:46,822 --> 01:30:56,123
WHEN SHE DANCED
WITH ME

1349
01:30:56,206 --> 01:31:05,925
COULD IT BE THAT SHE WAS
ONLY A FANTASY?

1350
01:31:05,966 --> 01:31:10,971
COULD IT BE TONIGHT IS
ALL THERE WILL EVER BE?

1351
01:31:16,435 --> 01:31:21,941
DANCING
IN HER ARMS FOREVER

1352
01:31:21,982 --> 01:31:29,240
MY HEART
WILL NEVER BE FREE

1353
01:31:29,323 --> 01:31:34,328
DREAMING OF THE NIGHT
SHE DANCED WITH ME

1354
01:31:40,960 --> 01:31:45,965
'DREAMING OF THE NIGHT
SHE DANCED WITH ME

1355
01:32:12,037 --> 01:32:14,373
Stepmother:
CINDERELLA!

1356
01:32:16,583 --> 01:32:19,336
WHERE IS
THAT WRETCHED GIRL?

1357
01:32:19,378 --> 01:32:22,131
CINDERELLA!

1358
01:32:22,214 --> 01:32:23,674
YES, STEPMOTHER?

1359
01:32:23,715 --> 01:32:25,509
THERE YOU ARE.

1360
01:32:25,551 --> 01:32:28,637
WHY DO YOU NOT COME
WHEN I CALL?

1361
01:32:28,720 --> 01:32:32,516
I WANT A WEAK
INFUSION OF TEA.

1362
01:32:32,558 --> 01:32:35,853
MY HEAD IS FIT
FOR CRACKING.

1363
01:32:39,398 --> 01:32:41,525
GOOD MORNING,
MAMA.

1364
01:32:41,567 --> 01:32:43,360
MORNING, MAMA.

1365
01:32:43,402 --> 01:32:44,653
BRING
THE BREAKFAST.

1366
01:32:44,736 --> 01:32:46,572
IMMEDIATELY,
CINDERELLA.

1367
01:32:48,073 --> 01:32:49,658
I WASN'T ABLE
TO SLEEP.

1368
01:32:49,741 --> 01:32:53,620
OH, OH, THE EXCITEMENT
OF LAST NIGHT!

1369
01:32:53,704 --> 01:32:56,748
NOT ON THE BED,
MY PRECIOUS.

1370
01:32:56,790 --> 01:32:58,750
Palatine: YOU WOULD
HAVE BEEN AMAZED.

1371
01:32:58,792 --> 01:33:02,463
YOUR STEPSISTERS
WERE A TRIUMPH.

1372
01:33:02,504 --> 01:33:06,550
HAD IT NOT BEEN FOR THE LATE ARRIVAL
OF THAT MYSTERIOUS PRINCESS,

1373
01:33:06,592 --> 01:33:11,221
I FEEL SURE THE PRINCE WOULD HAVE MADE
HIS CHOICE BETWEEN MY TWO ANGELS.

1374
01:33:11,305 --> 01:33:13,223
WHAT PRINCESS WAS THAT?

1375
01:33:13,265 --> 01:33:15,017
NOBODY SEEMED TO KNOW.

1376
01:33:15,058 --> 01:33:17,311
HE SEEMED QUITE
TAKEN WITH HER,

1377
01:33:17,394 --> 01:33:19,771
BUT THEN, MEN ALWAYS
Go FOR THE OBVIOUS.

1378
01:33:19,813 --> 01:33:22,107
OH, YES.

1379
01:33:22,149 --> 01:33:26,653
I MEAN, SHE WAS NOT
THAT PRETTY...

1380
01:33:26,695 --> 01:33:29,573
STRIKING, PERHAPS.

1381
01:33:29,615 --> 01:33:31,825
Isobella: DON'T
FORGET M'! BREAKFAST.

1382
01:33:31,867 --> 01:33:33,577
Stepmother:
BREAKFAST.

1383
01:33:33,660 --> 01:33:35,329
THINK, MAMA--

1384
01:33:35,412 --> 01:33:39,500
WE WERE ACTUALLY
THERE AT THE CASTLE.

1385
01:33:39,583 --> 01:33:42,503
WHERE YOU BELONG,
MY DEAR.

1386
01:33:42,586 --> 01:33:45,839
I WONDER WHAT THE
PRINCE IS DOING TODAY?

1387
01:33:45,923 --> 01:33:49,009
I'LL TELL YOU WHAT THE PRINCE
IS GOING TO DO TODAY.

1388
01:33:49,051 --> 01:33:52,930
THE PRINCE IS GOING TO EXERCISE
HIS ROYAL PREROGATIVE FOR ONCE.

1389
01:33:53,013 --> 01:33:54,264
King: LEAVE US.

1390
01:33:54,306 --> 01:33:56,266
No, STAY. I WANT YOU
TO HEAR THIS.

1391
01:33:56,350 --> 01:33:59,812
I'M SICK AND TIRED OF BEING
TREATED LIKE SOME VILLAGE IDIOT!

1392
01:33:59,853 --> 01:34:01,104
King: I'M GLAD YOU
STAYED TO HEAR THAT.

1393
01:34:01,188 --> 01:34:02,773
AFTER ALL, HE IS THE
HEIR TO THE THRONE.

1394
01:34:02,815 --> 01:34:05,984
FATHER, YOU'RE THE ONE WHO
TREATS ME LIKE AN IDIOT.

1395
01:34:06,026 --> 01:34:07,986
YOU ARRANGE A
BRIDE-FINDING BALL.

1396
01:34:08,028 --> 01:34:10,989
AGAINST MY BETTER JUDGMENT,
I FALL IN WITH YOUR PLANS.

1397
01:34:11,031 --> 01:34:12,491
I PLAY MY PART.

1398
01:34:12,533 --> 01:34:15,953
I GREET, I'M POLITE,
I DANCE WITH, I FLATTER,

1399
01:34:16,036 --> 01:34:19,832
I CONCEAL MY BOREDOM FROM HALF A DOZEN
TWITTERING MAIDENS OF BLUE BLOOD.

1400
01:34:19,873 --> 01:34:21,959
IN SHORT, I FULFILL MY SIDE
OF THE BARGAIN.

1401
01:34:22,000 --> 01:34:23,961
TRUE. I CAN 'T
FAULT HIM THERE.

1402
01:34:24,002 --> 01:34:26,630
AND THEN, BY SOME MIRACLE, I
FIND THE LADY OF MY CHOICE,

1403
01:34:26,672 --> 01:34:29,299
AND WHAT HAPPENS?
YOU FRIGHTEN HER AWAY!

1404
01:34:29,341 --> 01:34:31,301
A SEARCH HAS BEEN MADE,
YOUR ROYAL HIGHNESS.

1405
01:34:31,343 --> 01:34:33,804
IS BEING MADE
EVEN AS WE SPEAK.

1406
01:34:33,846 --> 01:34:35,097
OUR POLICE--

1407
01:34:35,180 --> 01:34:36,974
OUR POLICE, FATHER, COULDN'T
FIND A MISSING HAYSTACK,

1408
01:34:37,015 --> 01:34:39,268
LET ALONE A NEEDLE.

1409
01:34:39,351 --> 01:34:41,645
HOW COULD SHE DISAPPEAR
WITHOUT A TRACE?

1410
01:34:41,687 --> 01:34:44,314
DO WE NOT HAVE FRONTIERS,
CUSTOMS POSTS, GUARDS?

1411
01:34:44,356 --> 01:34:45,983
WE HAVE CUSTOMS,
OF COURSE.

1412
01:34:46,066 --> 01:34:47,860
VALUABLE SOURCE
OF REVENUE.

1413
01:34:47,901 --> 01:34:50,529
AND MOST PEOPLE SAY THAT OUR
POLICEMEN ARE WONDERFUL.

1414
01:34:50,571 --> 01:34:53,949
THIS IS APPARENTLY THE ONLY
CLUE WE HAVE, AND I FOUND IT.

1415
01:34:53,991 --> 01:34:55,284
IT'S REMARKABLY DAINTY.

1416
01:34:55,367 --> 01:34:56,618
EXACTLY.

1417
01:34:58,370 --> 01:35:01,373
IT'S UNIQUE...
LIKE ITS VANISHED OWNER.

1418
01:35:02,875 --> 01:35:04,626
THEREFORE, WE MUST USE IT.

1419
01:35:06,211 --> 01:35:09,882
WHOEVER FITS THE SLIPPER
MUST FIT THE BILL!

1420
01:35:11,508 --> 01:35:14,261
HE'S RIGHT.
HE'S RIGHT!

1421
01:35:14,344 --> 01:35:17,306
WHOEVER FITS THIS SLIPPER
SHALL MARRY MY SON!

1422
01:35:17,389 --> 01:35:19,808
YOUR MAJESTY, YOU HAVE
SOLVED THE PROBLEM.

1423
01:35:19,892 --> 01:35:20,976
QUITE So.

1424
01:35:21,059 --> 01:35:22,311
NOW, WE MUST ACT--

1425
01:35:22,394 --> 01:35:23,604
UH, YOU MUST ACT.

1426
01:35:23,687 --> 01:35:25,647
UM, THIS SLIPPER
MUST BE TAKEN

1427
01:35:25,731 --> 01:35:28,650
TO EVERY STRANGER
OF NOTE IN THE LAND.

1428
01:35:28,692 --> 01:35:30,486
THIS REALLY IS--

1429
01:35:30,569 --> 01:35:32,988
IT REALLY IS
VERY DAINTY.

1430
01:35:33,071 --> 01:35:34,990
UM, THE YOUNG LADY
ARRIVED INCOGNITA

1431
01:35:35,073 --> 01:35:37,034
BUT MUST OBVIOUSLY BE
OF SOME CONSEQUENCE.

1432
01:35:37,075 --> 01:35:39,328
SHE CANNOT REMAIN
UNKNOWN FOREVER.

1433
01:35:39,411 --> 01:35:40,954
A PROCLAMATION
IS REQUIRED, SIRE.

1434
01:35:41,038 --> 01:35:42,664
YES. DRAFT IT
IMMEDIATELY.

1435
01:35:42,748 --> 01:35:45,167
BE IT KNOWN THAT IT IS
OUR ROYAL WILL

1436
01:35:45,250 --> 01:35:47,836
TO FIND THE OWNER OF
THIS CHARMING, UH"

1437
01:35:47,920 --> 01:35:49,838
HALF THE SIZE
OF YOUR MOTHER'S--

1438
01:35:49,922 --> 01:35:51,882
THIS GLASS SLIPPER,
ET CETERA, ET CETERA.

1439
01:35:51,924 --> 01:35:53,759
YOU'D BETTER
TAKE IT WITH YOU.

1440
01:35:53,801 --> 01:35:55,219
VERY DISTURBING.

1441
01:35:55,260 --> 01:35:58,430
HMM. I'M PROUD
OF YOU, EDWARD.

1442
01:36:00,182 --> 01:36:03,435
BY ROYAL COMMAND
OF HIS MAJESTY THE KING,

1443
01:36:03,477 --> 01:36:05,270
KNOW THIS--

1444
01:36:05,354 --> 01:36:08,732
THAT WHOSOEVER SHALL TRY ON
THIS SLIPPER

1445
01:36:08,774 --> 01:36:12,110
AND FIND IT A PERFECT FIT,

1446
01:36:12,194 --> 01:36:14,488
THEN, BY ROYAL DECREE,

1447
01:36:14,530 --> 01:36:16,782
SHE SHALL BE GIVEN
IN MARRIAGE

1448
01:36:16,865 --> 01:36:20,953
TO HIS ROYAL HIGHNESS
THE PRINCE EDWARD OF EUPHRANIA,

1449
01:36:20,994 --> 01:36:22,955
HEIR TO THE THRONE.

1450
01:36:23,038 --> 01:36:25,874
GOD SAVE THE KING!

1451
01:36:28,418 --> 01:36:29,419
PUSH! PUSH!

1452
01:36:29,461 --> 01:36:31,130
OH, I AM PUSHING, MAMA!

1453
01:36:31,171 --> 01:36:33,132
IT DOESN'T FIT.
LET ME TRY.

1454
01:36:33,215 --> 01:36:34,842
OOH...

1455
01:36:35,968 --> 01:36:38,428
NOW, PUSH HARD!

1456
01:36:43,684 --> 01:36:45,310
Edward:
HAVE YOU FOUND HER?

1457
01:36:45,394 --> 01:36:47,521
ANY SIGN OF HER AT ALL?

1458
01:36:47,563 --> 01:36:48,981
AND YOU?

1459
01:36:49,064 --> 01:36:50,899
AND YOU?

1460
01:37:19,370 --> 01:37:20,496
SIR?

1461
01:37:20,538 --> 01:37:21,914
HMM?

1462
01:37:21,997 --> 01:37:23,999
I DON'T CARE
WHAT ANYONE SAYS.

1463
01:37:24,041 --> 01:37:26,043
I KNOW SHE EXISTS.

1464
01:37:29,839 --> 01:37:31,632
THE SLIPPER
WILL REMAIN THERE

1465
01:37:31,715 --> 01:37:34,718
AS A MONUMENT TO
MY LOST LOVE.

1466
01:37:41,392 --> 01:37:44,019
Edward:
HOW ABSURD LIFE IS.

1467
01:37:44,019 --> 01:37:46,313
DOWN THERE, EVERYTHING
IS So SIMPLE.

1468
01:37:46,397 --> 01:37:48,858
PEOPLE MEET,
FALL IN LOVE,

1469
01:37:48,899 --> 01:37:50,276
MARRY,
AND HAVE CHILDREN.

1470
01:37:51,694 --> 01:37:53,946
I DARESAY
THEY ENVY ME HERE.

1471
01:37:54,029 --> 01:37:58,826
I'M TOLD ENVY OF PRINCES
IS A COMMON ENOUGH THING.

1472
01:38:19,597 --> 01:38:23,559
Edward: 3 MONTHS,
6 DAYS, 10 HOURS.

1473
01:38:23,601 --> 01:38:27,313
THAT'S HOW LONG IT'S BEEN
SINCE LAST I SAW HER.

1474
01:38:27,396 --> 01:38:29,982
WHAT TORTURE LOVE IS!

1475
01:38:30,065 --> 01:38:31,734
YES.

1476
01:38:33,235 --> 01:38:36,155
OH, HOW SELFISH OF ME.
FORGIVE ME, JOHN.

1477
01:38:36,197 --> 01:38:38,157
HAVE YOU SEEN
YOUR LADY CAROLINE?

1478
01:38:38,240 --> 01:38:39,992
OH, YES...

1479
01:38:40,075 --> 01:38:41,577
INFREQUENTLY.

1480
01:38:44,246 --> 01:38:46,040
WHAT TORTURE LOVE IS.

1481
01:38:51,420 --> 01:38:55,174
YOU SEE, SIR, IF MY FATHER
WERE A CHANCELLOR...

1482
01:38:55,257 --> 01:38:58,219
HOW EASY IT WOULD BE

1483
01:38:58,260 --> 01:39:01,597
THE LOVELY
LADY CAROLINE

1484
01:39:01,639 --> 01:39:04,934
WOULD BE A PROPER
WIFE, YOU SEE

1485
01:39:05,017 --> 01:39:07,228
BUT MY FATHER
WAS A SERVANT

1486
01:39:07,269 --> 01:39:10,648
AND MY MOTHER
SAME AS HE

1487
01:39:10,731 --> 01:39:15,027
So THE LADY
OF MY CHOOSING

1488
01:39:15,111 --> 01:39:18,948
IS A WORLD AWAY
FROM ME

1489
01:39:18,989 --> 01:39:20,950
THAT'S HOW IT IS

1490
01:39:20,991 --> 01:39:23,077
AND HOW IT WAS

1491
01:39:23,160 --> 01:39:29,875
AND HOW IT
ALWAYS SHALL BE

1492
01:39:29,959 --> 01:39:32,795
POSITION
AND POSITIONING

1493
01:39:32,878 --> 01:39:35,172
ARE SOCIALLY
CONDITIONING

1494
01:39:35,256 --> 01:39:38,008
HOW YOU'RE BORN,
HOW YOU'RE BRED

1495
01:39:38,092 --> 01:39:40,261
PREDETERMINE
WHO YOU WED

1496
01:39:40,302 --> 01:39:43,139
WHICH MEANS THERE'S
NOTHING CHANGEABLE

1497
01:39:43,180 --> 01:39:45,349
NOTHING'S
REARRANGEABLE

1498
01:39:45,391 --> 01:39:47,810
POSITION
AND POSITIONING

1499
01:39:47,852 --> 01:39:51,522
ARE EVERYTHING
IN LIFE

1500
01:39:51,564 --> 01:39:53,816
FARMERS' DAUGHTERS
MARRY COW HERDS

1501
01:39:53,858 --> 01:39:56,652
THAT'S ACCEPTABLE
AND RIGHT YES.

1502
01:39:56,694 --> 01:39:59,572
BUT ABSURD
AND QUITE UNHEARD OF

1503
01:39:59,655 --> 01:40:02,992
IS A MILK MAID
AND A KNIGHT

1504
01:40:03,075 --> 01:40:05,286
I QUITE AGREE

1505
01:40:05,327 --> 01:40:06,787
HE QUITE AGREES

1506
01:40:06,829 --> 01:40:08,330
SHE QUITE
AGREES

1507
01:40:08,372 --> 01:40:13,836
THAT'S HOW IT
ALWAYS SHALL BE

1508
01:40:15,087 --> 01:40:17,506
POSITION AND
POSITIONING

1509
01:40:17,590 --> 01:40:19,884
ARE SOCIALLY
CONDITIONING

1510
01:40:19,967 --> 01:40:22,303
PEOPLE HIGH,
PEOPLE LOW

1511
01:40:22,344 --> 01:40:24,555
KEEP THE STATE
OF STATUS QUO

1512
01:40:24,597 --> 01:40:26,974
WHICH MEANS THERE'S
NOTHING CHANGEABLE

1513
01:40:27,016 --> 01:40:29,185
NOTHING'S REARRANGEABLE

1514
01:40:29,268 --> 01:40:31,520
POSITION
AND POSITIONING

1515
01:40:31,562 --> 01:40:34,482
ARE EVERYTHING
IN LIFE

1516
01:40:34,565 --> 01:40:36,776
WHEN A LAD FIRST
JOINS THE ARMY

1517
01:40:36,859 --> 01:40:38,444
THIS IS WHAT HE
LEARNS FOR STARTERS

1518
01:40:38,527 --> 01:40:40,946
NEVER COURT YOUR
COLONEL'S DAUGHTER

1519
01:40:41,030 --> 01:40:43,365
OR HE'LL HAVE YOUR GUTS
FOR GARTERS

1520
01:40:43,407 --> 01:40:45,367
THAT'S HOW IT IS

1521
01:40:45,451 --> 01:40:47,077
AND HOW IT WAS

1522
01:40:47,161 --> 01:40:52,374
AND HOW IT ALWAYS
SHALL BE

1523
01:40:52,458 --> 01:40:55,961
John: FOR POSITION
AND POSITIONING

1524
01:40:56,045 --> 01:40:58,214
ARE SOCIALLY
CONDITIONING

1525
01:40:58,339 --> 01:41:00,341
HOW YOU DRESS
AND HOLD YOUR HEAD

1526
01:41:00,382 --> 01:41:02,176
PREDETERMINE
WHO YOU WED

1527
01:41:02,259 --> 01:41:04,386
WHICH MEANS THERE'S
NOTHING CHANGEABLE

1528

NOTHING'S
REARRANGEABLE

1529
01:41:06,222 --> 01:41:08,140
POSITION AND
POSITIONING

1530
01:41:08,224 --> 01:41:10,142
ARE EVERYTHING
IN LIFE

1531
01:41:10,226 --> 01:41:12,061
ALL THE SERVANTS
IN A CASTLE

1532
01:41:12,144 --> 01:41:14,188
THEY REFLECT
THE WORLD OUTSIDE

1533
01:41:14,230 --> 01:41:16,190
THEY HAVE RANK
AND THEY HAVE STATION

1534
01:41:16,232 --> 01:41:18,192
AND ADHERE TO THEM
WITH PRIDE

1535
01:41:18,234 --> 01:41:20,194
OH, THE STAFF THAT WORK
BELOW STAIRS

1536
01:41:20,236 --> 01:41:21,987
THEY HAVE DREAMS
TO WORK ABOVE

1537
01:41:22,071 --> 01:41:23,864
AND THEY'RE LOCKED
IN THEIR POSITIONS

1538
01:41:23,906 --> 01:41:26,492
BY TRADITION'S
IRON GLOVE

1539
01:41:26,575 --> 01:41:27,660
THAT'S HOW IT IS?

1540
01:41:27,743 --> 01:41:29,411
AND HOW IT WAS

1541
01:41:29,453 --> 01:41:34,208
AND HOW IT ALWAYS
SHALL BE

1542
01:41:34,250 --> 01:41:36,085
WE KNOW OUR PLACE,
AND HAPPILY

1543
01:41:36,168 --> 01:41:38,045
WE BOW AND SCRAPE
AND BEND OUR KNEE

1544
01:41:38,087 --> 01:41:39,547
BUT WOE BETIDE
THE WOE BEGONE

1545
01:41:39,588 --> 01:41:41,757
WHO TRY TO JOIN
OUR ECHELON

FOR PRIVILEGE
IS NOT, YOU SEE

1547
01:41:43,801 --> 01:41:45,803
CONFINED TO JUST
THE ROYALTY

1548
01:41:45,845 --> 01:41:47,638
BEHIND THESE DOORS,
I MIGHT SUGGEST

1549
01:41:47,721 --> 01:41:49,348
I'M SIMILARLY BLESSED

1550
01:41:49,431 --> 01:41:51,267
Chorus: YES, POSITION
AND POSITIONING

1551
01:41:51,350 --> 01:41:53,310
ARE SOCIALLY
CONDITIONING

1552
01:41:53,352 --> 01:41:55,104
THOUGH YOU WORK
YOUR LIFE AWAY

1553
01:41:55,146 --> 01:41:56,856
WHERE YOU START
IS WHERE YOU STAY

1554
01:41:56,939 --> 01:41:58,816
WHICH MEANS THERE'S
NOTHING CHANGEABLE

1555
01:41:58,899 --> 01:42:00,526
NOTHING' S
REARRANGEABLE

1556
01:42:00,609 --> 01:42:02,153
POSITION AND
POSITIONING

1557
01:42:02,236 --> 01:42:03,696
ARE STUCK WITH YOU
FOR LIFE

1558
01:44:37,850 --> 01:44:41,061
POSITION AND
POSITIONING

1559
01:44:41,103 --> 01:44:44,815
ARE SOCIALLY
CONDITIONING

1560
01:44:44,857 --> 01:44:48,027
THOUGH YOU WORK
YOUR LIFE AWAY

1561
01:44:48,110 --> 01:44:50,613
WHERE YOU START
IS WHERE YOU STAY

1562
01:44:50,696 --> 01:44:52,865
WHICH MEANS THERE'S
NOTHING CHANGEABLE

1563
01:44:52,948 --> 01:44:54,325
NOTHING' S
REARRANGEABLE

1564
01:44:54,366 --> 01:44:55,993
POSITION AND
POSITIONING

1565
01:44:56,076 --> 01:44:57,703
ARE EVERYTHING
IN LIFE

1566
01:44:57,787 --> 01:44:59,705
EVERYTHING IN LIFE

1567
01:44:59,747 --> 01:45:00,915
EVERYTHING
IN LIFE

1568
01:45:00,956 --> 01:45:04,084
I LIFE, LIFE, LIFE,
LIFE, LIFE, LIFE I

1569
01:45:14,136 --> 01:45:16,263
THAT'S HOW IT IS?
AND HOW IT WAS.

1570
01:45:16,305 --> 01:45:20,726
AND HOW IT
ALWAYS SHALL BE

1571
01:45:22,394 --> 01:45:24,355
Edward: ALL RIGHT,
YOU'VE CONVINCED ME,

1572
01:45:24,396 --> 01:45:26,315
BUT I SHALL
PROVE YOU WRONG,

1573
01:45:26,357 --> 01:45:27,817
FOR PRINCES,
WHEN CONVINCED,

1574
01:45:27,900 --> 01:45:29,527
TAKE ADVANTAGE
OF THEIR POSITION.

1575
01:45:29,568 --> 01:45:32,822
I CAN'T THINK WHY I DIDN'T DO
SOMETHING ABOUT IT BEFORE.

1576
01:45:32,905 --> 01:45:34,198
John I ABOUT WHAT?

1577
01:45:34,240 --> 01:45:36,325
WAIT, AND ALL
WILL BE REVEALED.

1578
01:45:36,367 --> 01:45:37,993
KNEEL.

1579
01:45:38,077 --> 01:45:39,203
WHAT? ME?

1580
01:45:39,245 --> 01:45:41,163
I COMMAND IT.

1581
01:45:41,205 --> 01:45:45,000
I DUB THEE, AS IS MY
PRIVILEGE SO TO DO,

1582
01:45:45,084 --> 01:45:47,336
A KNIGHT OF THE ORDER
OF SAINT DAVID.

1583
01:45:47,378 --> 01:45:49,547
ARISE, SIR JOHN.

1584
01:45:49,588 --> 01:45:51,507
AS A KNIGHT
OF THE REALM,

1585
01:45:51,549 --> 01:45:53,592
YOU CAN NOW CLAIM THE HAND
OF THE FAIR LADY CAROLINE--

1586
01:45:53,676 --> 01:45:55,928
WHICH IS FORTUNATE
FOR YOU BUT WHICH, ALAS,

1587
01:45:56,011 --> 01:45:58,597
LEAVES ME WITHOUT
A COMPANION-AT-ARMS.

1588
01:45:58,681 --> 01:46:00,015
WHAT'S YOUR NAME?

1589
01:46:01,851 --> 01:46:03,853
UH, WILLOUGHBY,
YOUR ROYAL HIGHNESS.

1590
01:46:03,894 --> 01:46:05,437
CAN HE NOT ANSWER
FOR HIMSELF?

1591
01:46:05,521 --> 01:46:07,481
IT'S NOT HIS
POSITIOH, YOU SEE.

1592
01:46:07,523 --> 01:46:08,607
AH, TRUE.

1593
01:46:08,691 --> 01:46:10,151
BUT IT WILL BE.

1594
01:46:10,192 --> 01:46:12,361
I SHALL ELEVATE YOU, TOO,
WILLOUGHBY.

1595
01:46:12,403 --> 01:46:15,322
FROM HENCEFORTH, YOU ARE MY
PERSONAL COMPANION-AT-ARMS,

1596
01:46:15,364 --> 01:46:17,867
WITH ALL THE PRIVILEGES
SUCH OFFICE BESTOWS.

1597
01:46:17,950 --> 01:46:19,410
YOU WILL NEED
A SWORD.

1598
01:46:19,452 --> 01:46:21,203
HERE.

1599
01:46:21,245 --> 01:46:23,080
TAKE MINE.

1600
01:46:24,874 --> 01:46:26,667
IT GOES THE OTHER
WAY AROUND.

1601
01:46:26,709 --> 01:46:28,169
HELP HIM, WILL YOU?

1602
01:46:28,210 --> 01:46:30,296
WELL, THAT'S A GOOD
MORNING'S WORK.

1603
01:46:30,379 --> 01:46:32,298
John: CONGRATULATIONS,
WILLOUGHBY.

1604
01:46:32,381 --> 01:46:35,301
AND CONGRATULATIONS
TO YOU, TOO, SIR JOHN.

1605
01:46:35,384 --> 01:46:36,886
WHAT CAN I SAY?

1606
01:46:36,927 --> 01:46:38,512
NOTHING.

1607
01:46:38,554 --> 01:46:40,014
GO AND FIND HER.

1608
01:46:40,097 --> 01:46:41,599
BE HAPPY.

1609
01:46:48,147 --> 01:46:50,649
HAPPY ENOUGH
FOR BOTH OF US.

1610
01:49:01,238 --> 01:49:03,199
I MUST FETCH THE PRINCE.

1611
01:50:22,695 --> 01:50:24,321
THIS IS AN OUTRAGE!

1612
01:50:24,405 --> 01:50:27,366
WHERE HAVE YOU BEEN,
YOU WRETCHED GIRL? YOU...

1613
01:50:28,909 --> 01:50:31,495
YOUR ROYAL HIGHNESS.

1614
01:50:38,127 --> 01:50:40,087
OH!
OH!

1615
01:50:42,256 --> 01:50:45,718
I LITTLE KNEW, MADAM, THAT I WOULD
HAVE THE PLEASURE OF MEETING

1616
01:50:45,801 --> 01:50:48,888
YOU AND YOUR DELIGHTFUL DAUGHTERS
AGAIN IN SUCH HAPPY CIRCUMSTANCES.

1617
01:50:48,971 --> 01:50:52,266
WHAT CIRCUMSTANCES,
YOUR ROYAL HIGHNESS?

1618
01:50:52,308 --> 01:50:55,978
YOU ARE THE LEGAL GUARDIAN, I
BELIEVE, OF MY WIFE TO BE.

1619
01:50:57,438 --> 01:51:00,983
YOUR WIFE TO BE?

1620
01:51:01,025 --> 01:51:04,487
WHY, YES. I AM MORE
THAN HER LEGAL GUARDIAN.

1621
01:51:04,570 --> 01:51:07,406
I HAVE BEEN A MOTHER TO HER.

1622
01:51:07,448 --> 01:51:10,034
THEN I DO RIGHT BY FORMALLY
ASKING YOUR PERMISSION

1623
01:51:10,117 --> 01:51:11,660
TO TAKE CINDERELLA'S
HAND IN MARRIAGE.

1624
01:51:11,702 --> 01:51:13,120
OH!
OH!

1625
01:51:13,204 --> 01:51:15,122
CONTROL YOURSELVES !

1626
01:51:15,164 --> 01:51:18,459
PERMISSION? WHY, OF COURSE!

1627
01:51:18,542 --> 01:51:21,587
GLADLY! NATURALLY.

1628
01:51:21,670 --> 01:51:24,131
I DON'T UNDERSTAND. DO I--

1629
01:51:24,173 --> 01:51:26,759
WILL YOU BE QUIET?

1630
01:51:26,842 --> 01:51:30,137
YOUR ROYAL HIGHNESS,
PLEASE ALLOW ME THE HONOR OF

1631
01:51:30,179 --> 01:51:33,015
INVITING YOU INTO
OUR HAPPY HOME.

1632
01:51:33,098 --> 01:51:36,936
COME, CINDERELLA, DEAR.
WE WERE So WORRIED ABOUT YOU.

1633
01:51:37,019 --> 01:51:40,815
THANK YOU, BUT No, I HAVE OTHER
URGENT BUSINESS TO ATTEND TO.

1634
01:51:44,985 --> 01:51:48,364
IN MY HAPPINESS,
I FORGIVE YOU ALL.

1635
01:51:52,535 --> 01:51:54,954
FORGIVE ME?

1636
01:51:55,037 --> 01:51:58,415
HOW DARE SHE FORGIVE ME?

1637
01:52:22,022 --> 01:52:24,608
AND WHAT DO THEY CALL YOU?

1638
01:52:24,650 --> 01:52:26,235
CINDERELLA,
YOUR MAJESTY.

1639
01:52:26,318 --> 01:52:28,446
A MOST UNUSUAL NAME.

1640
01:52:28,487 --> 01:52:30,990
Edward: THE NAME, MOTHER,
IS SURELY OF No IMPORTANCE.

1641
01:52:31,073 --> 01:52:34,952
ALL THAT MATTERS IS THAT I'VE MADE MY
CHOICE AND WAIT FOR YOUR BLESSINGS.

1642
01:52:35,035 --> 01:52:38,289
YOU GAVE US A LOT OF TROUBLE,
YOU KNOW, AFTER THE BALL.

1643
01:52:38,330 --> 01:52:41,292
PEOPLE LOOKING FOR YOU
EVERYWHERE. VANISHED, YOU SEE.

1644
01:52:41,375 --> 01:52:44,128
DID YOU Go BACK
TO YOUR OWN KINGDOM?

1645
01:52:44,211 --> 01:52:47,047
NO, YOUR MAJESTY. I WENT
BACK TO WHERE I LIVE.

1646
01:52:47,131 --> 01:52:48,674
AND WHERE IS THAT, CHILD?

1647
01:52:48,757 --> 01:52:49,717
WHY, HERE,
YOUR MAJESTY.

1648
01:52:49,800 --> 01:52:52,470
HERE? IN THE CASTLE?

1649
01:52:52,511 --> 01:52:55,806
No, FATHER. AS YOU'VE OFTEN
REMARKED, LOVE IS BLIND.

1650
01:52:55,848 --> 01:52:57,975
AND WE SOMETIMES DON'T LOOK
UNDER OUR NOSES.

1651
01:52:58,058 --> 01:53:01,437
CINDERELLA LIVES IN OUR OWN
EUPHRANIA, NOT 20 MILES FROM HERE.

1652
01:53:01,479 --> 01:53:03,522
WHO IS THIS GIRL?

1653
01:53:03,606 --> 01:53:07,234
WHY DOESN'T SOMEBODY TELL
ME WHAT IS GOING ON?

1654
01:53:07,318 --> 01:53:11,113
THIS IS THE GIRL THAT
EDWARD WANTS TO MARRY.

1655
01:53:11,155 --> 01:53:12,615
IS GOING TO
MARRY, FATHER.

1656
01:53:12,698 --> 01:53:15,367
I DON'T WISH TO
SEEM OFFENSIVE,

1657
01:53:15,451 --> 01:53:18,287
BUT IT DOES SEEM TO ME
THAT SHE'S MOST UNSUITABLY

1658
01:53:18,329 --> 01:53:20,831
DRESSED FOR SUCH A
SOLEMN OCCASION.

1659
01:53:20,915 --> 01:53:24,877
YOU'RE QUITE RIGHT, GRANDMAMA. IT'S
SOMETHING I SHALL CORRECT IMMEDIATELY.

1660
01:53:24,960 --> 01:53:27,254
FATHER, BY YOUR LEAVE.

1661
01:53:43,729 --> 01:53:45,356
King: QUESTIONS
OF PRECEDENT.

1662
01:53:45,439 --> 01:53:47,108
UNPRECEDENTED
QUESTIONS OF PRECEDENT.

1663
01:53:47,149 --> 01:53:48,609
MY OWN THOUGHT,
SIRE.

1664
01:53:48,651 --> 01:53:50,569
A MEETING, I THINK.
THE STAFF COUNCIL.

1665
01:53:50,653 --> 01:53:53,614
IT HAS ALREADY BEEN
CONVENED, YOUR MAJESTY.

1666
01:53:53,656 --> 01:53:55,574
PITY. CHARMING
LITTLE THING.

1667
01:53:55,658 --> 01:53:58,369
IN OTHER CIRCUMSTANCES...

1668
01:53:58,410 --> 01:54:00,287
MOST APPEALING.

1669
01:54:13,717 --> 01:54:15,427
WHO IS IT?

1670
01:54:15,469 --> 01:54:19,140
MILADY, I'M COMMANDED
BY HIS MAJESTY THE KING

1671
01:54:19,223 --> 01:54:21,183
TO REQUEST AN AUDIENCE.

1672
01:54:21,225 --> 01:54:22,643
OH.

1673
01:54:22,685 --> 01:54:24,854
ONE MOMENT, PLEASE.

1674
01:54:29,191 --> 01:54:30,734
PLEASE ENTER.

1675
01:54:35,739 --> 01:54:37,992
MI LORD CHAMBERLAIN.

1676
01:54:38,033 --> 01:54:40,077
MILADY.

1677
01:54:44,540 --> 01:54:48,127
FORGIVE ME FOR
DISTURBING YOUR REST...

1678
01:54:49,628 --> 01:54:53,132
BUT, ALAS, THERE ARE
SOME MATTERS OF STATE

1679
01:54:53,215 --> 01:54:54,675
THAT CANNOT BE DELAYED.

1680
01:54:54,717 --> 01:54:59,221
HIS MAJESTY HAS REQUESTED ME,
AS HIS PRINCIPAL MINISTER...

1681
01:54:59,263 --> 01:55:01,223
TO BROACH...

1682
01:55:01,307 --> 01:55:03,809
A QUESTION OF
SOME DELICACY.

1683
01:55:07,938 --> 01:55:09,440
I...

1684
01:55:12,902 --> 01:55:15,654
YOU LOVE THE PRINCE EDWARD,
DO YOU NOT?

1685
01:55:15,738 --> 01:55:17,865
WHY, OF COURSE.

1686
01:55:17,948 --> 01:55:19,241
WHO WOULDN'T?

1687
01:55:19,283 --> 01:55:20,743
OH, QUITE SO.

1688
01:55:20,826 --> 01:55:22,828
UH, PLEASE. PLEASE.

1689
01:55:24,288 --> 01:55:27,249
AND HE HAS EXPRESSED
HIS LOVE FOR YOU

1690
01:55:27,333 --> 01:55:28,751
BEFORE THE WHOLE COURT.

1691
01:55:28,834 --> 01:55:29,919
YES.

1692
01:55:29,960 --> 01:55:31,378
YES, HE HAS.

1693
01:55:31,462 --> 01:55:32,963
VERY COMMENDABLY.

1694
01:55:34,423 --> 01:55:35,966
BIS MAKES...

1695
01:55:39,804 --> 01:55:41,597
OH, DEAR.

1696
01:55:41,639 --> 01:55:44,099
OH, DEAR. OH, DEAR.
OH, DEAR.

1697
01:55:44,141 --> 01:55:47,144
I'M REALLY TOO OLD
FOR THIS SORT OF THING.

1698
01:55:48,604 --> 01:55:51,065
FORGIVE ME,
MY DEAR CHILD, BUT...

1699
01:55:51,107 --> 01:55:53,567
DESPITE MY APPEARANCE

1700
01:55:53,609 --> 01:55:57,822
AND THE POMP AND CIRCUMSTANCE
OF MY HIGH OFFICE...

1701
01:55:57,905 --> 01:56:01,867
I AM NOT WITHOUT UNDERSTANDING
OF YOUR PLIGHT.

1702
01:56:03,452 --> 01:56:05,913
FOR PLIGHT IT IS.

1703
01:56:05,955 --> 01:56:08,290
TO BE BLUNT,

1704
01:56:08,332 --> 01:56:10,167
BECAUSE THE HOUR IS LATE.

1705
01:56:10,251 --> 01:56:13,212
IT IS NOT POSSIBLE FOR HIS
MAJESTY TO GIVE CONSENT

1706
01:56:13,295 --> 01:56:15,297
TO SUCH A MARRIAGE.

1707
01:56:16,799 --> 01:56:18,759
NOT POSSIBLE?

1708
01:56:22,721 --> 01:56:24,723
WHAT DOES THAT MEAN?

1709
01:56:26,225 --> 01:56:27,893
WHAT ARE YOU SAYING?

1710
01:56:27,977 --> 01:56:29,645
HMM. WELL...

1711
01:56:32,731 --> 01:56:35,109
YOUR LOVE
FOR THE PRINCE

1712
01:56:35,151 --> 01:56:37,111
AND HIS LOVE FOR YOU,

1713
01:56:37,153 --> 01:56:41,240
WELL, THAT IS A FINE
AND PRIVATE THING.

1714
01:56:41,323 --> 01:56:44,285
WOULD THAT IT COULD
REMAIN so,

1715
01:56:44,326 --> 01:56:47,079
BUT THE TIMES DEMAND
SOMETHING DIFFERENT.

1716
01:56:47,163 --> 01:56:51,459
THE PRINCE MUST MAKE
A MARRIAGE OF ALLIANCE

1717
01:56:51,500 --> 01:56:55,087
WITH A PRINCESS
OF THE BLOOD ROYAL.

1718
01:56:55,171 --> 01:56:58,007
AND THAT IS WHY
I AM HERE,

1719
01:56:58,090 --> 01:57:00,092
BURDENED WITH
THIS UNHAPPY TASK.

1720
01:57:01,594 --> 01:57:03,554
YOU SEE,
MY DEAR CHILD,

1721
01:57:03,596 --> 01:57:07,349
IN LIFE, LOVE CANNOT
ALWAYS FIND A WAY.

1722
01:57:07,433 --> 01:57:09,351
YOU WERE BORN HERE,

1723
01:57:09,393 --> 01:57:12,188
SO YOU KNOW THAT
OUR LITTLE KINGDOM,

1724
01:57:12,229 --> 01:57:13,689
WHILST FAR FROM PERFECT,

1725
01:57:13,731 --> 01:57:17,193
HAS YET ENJOYED COUNTLESS
CENTURIES OF PEACE.

1726
01:57:17,234 --> 01:57:21,280
NOW THAT PEACE IS
THREATENED FROM WITHOUT.

1727
01:57:21,363 --> 01:57:24,325
THERE ARE SOME WHO LOOK
TOWARDS OUR FRONTIERS

1728
01:57:24,366 --> 01:57:25,868
WITH GREEDY EYES.

1729
01:57:27,870 --> 01:57:31,290
YOU SEE ONLY LOVE
AND HAPPINESS

1730
01:57:31,373 --> 01:57:34,418
STARING YOU IN THE FACE.

1731
01:57:34,502 --> 01:57:39,131
I SEE NOTHING BUT WAR
AND DESTRUCTION...

1732
01:57:40,674 --> 01:57:43,552
UNLESS A SACRIFICE
IS MADE.

1733
01:57:50,059 --> 01:57:51,977
AND THE SACRIFICE...

1734
01:57:52,103 --> 01:57:54,438
IS TO BE ME.

1735
01:57:54,522 --> 01:57:55,940
YES.

1736
01:57:56,023 --> 01:57:57,942
IT'S A LOT TO ASK,

1737
01:57:58,025 --> 01:58:00,486
BUT I HAVE TO
ASK IT.

1738
01:58:00,569 --> 01:58:02,113
TO LEAVE HIM NOW?

1739
01:58:02,154 --> 01:58:03,572
TO LEAVE HIM NOW,

1740
01:58:03,572 --> 01:58:05,658
BEFORE IT'S TOO LATE.

1741
01:58:05,741 --> 01:58:08,035
BUT HE WOULD
SEARCH FOR ME AGAIN.

1742
01:58:08,077 --> 01:58:10,412
HE WOULD SEARCH
FOR ME AND FIND ME.

1743
01:58:10,454 --> 01:58:11,956
I KNOW HE WOULD.

1744
01:58:11,997 --> 01:58:13,916
YES. THAT, TOO,
IS TRUE,

1745
01:58:13,958 --> 01:58:15,876
BUT WE'VE ALLOWED
FOR THAT.

1746
01:58:15,918 --> 01:58:18,921
IT IS SUGGESTED
THAT WITH PROPER DOWRY

1747
01:58:18,963 --> 01:58:20,881
AND EVERY OTHER
CONSIDERATION

1748
01:58:20,923 --> 01:58:24,426
FITTING THE CIRCUMSTANCES
OF THIS MOST UNHAPPY OCCASION,

1749
01:58:24,510 --> 01:58:28,931
IT IS SUGGESTED THAT YOU BE
TAKEN FROM HERE THIS VERY NIGHT

1750
01:58:28,973 --> 01:58:33,602
TO A SECRET PLACE OF EXILE
FAR BEYOND OUR BORDERS.

1751
01:58:35,104 --> 01:58:37,148
YOU HAVE FORGOTTEN
NOTHING, THEN.

1752
01:58:39,608 --> 01:58:42,570
I THANK YOU FOR
BRINGING SUCH TIDINGS

1753
01:58:42,611 --> 01:58:45,114
WITH TACT
AND UNDERSTANDING.

1754
01:58:45,156 --> 01:58:48,784
YOU WERE WELL CHOSEN
FOR THE TASK.

1755
01:58:51,787 --> 01:58:54,790
YOUR LADIES-IN-WAITING
WILL BE SENT FOR.

1756
01:58:57,460 --> 01:59:00,421
BUT IN BOWING TO
THE ROYAL DEMANDS,

1757
01:59:00,504 --> 01:59:03,632
I MUST MAKE ONE
OF MY OWN.

1758
01:59:05,134 --> 01:59:06,886
MILADY?

1759
01:59:06,969 --> 01:59:10,055
IT IS NOT VERY MUCH

1760
01:59:10,139 --> 01:59:12,600
AND SOMETHING
WHICH...

1761
01:59:12,641 --> 01:59:16,562
WITH YOUR GREATER EXPERIENCE
IN THESE MATTERS,

1762
01:59:16,604 --> 01:59:19,648
YOU WILL NOT FIND
VERY DIFFICULT.

1763
01:59:22,651 --> 01:59:25,654
I WISH YOU TO TELL HIS
ROYAL HIGHNESS...

1764
01:59:27,239 --> 01:59:28,741
PRINCE EDWARD...

1765
01:59:30,242 --> 01:59:33,078
I WISH
YOU'D TELL HIM...

1766
01:59:33,162 --> 01:59:36,081
TELL HIM...

1767
01:59:36,165 --> 01:59:39,126
TELL HIM THAT
IT WASN'T LOVE

1768
01:59:39,168 --> 01:59:41,378
SAY I TRIED

1769
01:59:41,462 --> 01:59:43,464
SAY I LIED

1770
01:59:43,506 --> 01:59:47,301
TELL HIM
I'M UNWORTHY OF

1771
01:59:47,343 --> 01:59:52,014
WHAT HE FEELS
INSIDE

1772
01:59:52,097 --> 01:59:55,684
TELL HIM THAT
YOU HEARD ME SAY

1773
01:59:55,726 --> 01:59:57,895
WHAT SEEMED RIGHT

1774
01:59:57,937 --> 02:00:00,523
JUST LAST NIGHT

1775
02:00:00,564 --> 02:00:04,735
SIMPLY SEEMED
TO FADE AWAY

1776
02:00:04,819 --> 02:00:09,198
IN THE LIGHT OF DAY

1777
02:00:10,658 --> 02:00:13,285
TELL HIM OF THE
COUNTLESS OTHER LOVERS

1778
02:00:13,369 --> 02:00:15,621
WHOM I TANTALIZED,
VICTIMIZED

1779
02:00:15,704 --> 02:00:17,706
TELL HIM OF
THE MANY OTHER TIMES

1780
02:00:17,790 --> 02:00:19,416
I'VE PLAYED
THIS HEARTLESS GAME

1781
02:00:19,458 --> 02:00:20,918
JUST TEE SAW'.

1782
02:00:21,001 --> 02:00:23,963
'TELL HIM
WHAT I REALLY AM

1783
02:00:24,004 --> 02:00:28,217
IS JUST A COLD
AND EMPTY SHAM

1784
02:00:29,552 --> 02:00:33,430
TELL HIM ANYTHING

1785
02:00:33,472 --> 02:00:42,940
BUT NOT
THAT I LOVE HIM

1786
02:00:51,407 --> 02:00:54,827
TELL HIM THAT
IT WASN'T LOVE

1787
02:00:54,869 --> 02:00:58,831
ALL WE SHARED,
ALL WE CARED

1788
02:00:58,914 --> 02:01:03,127
MAKE HIM HATE
MY MEMORY

1789
02:01:03,169 --> 02:01:07,339
MAKE HIM GLAD HE'S FREE

1790
02:01:08,841 --> 02:01:12,720
PAINT ME EVIL,
PAINT ME CRUEL

1791
02:01:12,761 --> 02:01:17,016
SAY I BROKE EVERY RULE

1792
02:01:17,099 --> 02:01:21,979
MAKE HIM FEEL
THAT HE'S A FOOL

1793
02:01:22,021 --> 02:01:26,734
FOR HIS LOVING ME

1794
02:01:26,776 --> 02:01:32,406
DON'T LET HIM KNOW

1795
02:01:32,448 --> 02:01:36,911
WHY I MUST LEAVE HIM

1796
02:01:36,994 --> 02:01:41,415
WHY I MUS GO

1797
02:01:41,457 --> 02:01:46,378
SO FAR AWAY

1798
02:01:46,462 --> 02:01:52,676
FOR IF HE KNEW

1799
02:01:52,718 --> 02:01:59,058
HOW MUCH I LOVE HIM

1800
02:01:59,141 --> 02:02:05,439
NO POWER ON EARTH

1801
02:02:06,857 --> 02:02:11,862
COULD MAKE HIM STAY

1802
02:02:56,031 --> 02:02:57,491
YOUR MAJESTY.

1803
02:03:05,708 --> 02:03:07,710
THE DEED IS DONE.

1804
02:03:11,213 --> 02:03:15,426
SHE CERTAINLY BEHAVED
LIKE A PRINCESS.

1805
02:03:24,018 --> 02:03:25,686
Edward: COME ON!

1806
02:03:25,728 --> 02:03:26,729
THE FRONTIER!

1807
02:04:18,739 --> 02:04:20,699
FATHER.

1808
02:04:22,284 --> 02:04:25,246
FATHER, YOU HAVE DONE
WHAT YOU'VE DONE.

1809
02:04:25,287 --> 02:04:27,915
THE SPOILS
ARE YOURS,

1810
02:04:27,957 --> 02:04:30,417
BUT IT IS
A SMALL VICTORY.

1811
02:04:30,459 --> 02:04:32,419
IF I COULD EXPLAIN...

1812
02:04:32,503 --> 02:04:33,963
SPARE ME THAT.

1813
02:04:34,004 --> 02:04:36,966
SPARE ME THE FINAL HYPOCRISY
OF YOUR SYMPATHY.

1814
02:04:37,007 --> 02:04:39,468
TAKE YOUR MAP.

1815
02:04:39,510 --> 02:04:41,470
REARRANGE IT TO YOUR
HEARTS CONTENT.

1816
02:04:41,512 --> 02:04:43,305
MAKE YOUR PRECIOUS
MARRIAGE OF ALLIANCE.

1817
02:04:43,389 --> 02:04:45,266
YOU'VE DESTROYED WHATEVER
VESTIGE OF LOVE AND HAPPINESS

1818
02:04:45,307 --> 02:04:46,475
I MIGHT HAVE FOUND,

1819
02:04:46,517 --> 02:04:48,894
AND YOU'VE DONE IT IN
THE NAME OF PATRIOTISM.

1820
02:04:48,978 --> 02:04:51,397
SO... LET IT BE THUS.

1821
02:04:51,480 --> 02:04:52,690
CHOOSE ME A BRIDE

1822
02:04:52,773 --> 02:04:54,733
FROM AMONGST THE RAGBAG
OF ROYAL VIRGINS

1823
02:04:54,775 --> 02:04:55,943
I HAVE TWICE
REJECTED.

1824
02:04:56,026 --> 02:04:58,487
CHOOSE WHO YOU WILL.
I CARE NOT.

1825
02:04:58,529 --> 02:05:00,990
I'LL PLAY MY PUBLIC
PART TO THE ALTAR

1826
02:05:01,031 --> 02:05:02,616
BUT NO FURTHER.

1827
02:05:02,658 --> 02:05:05,119
YOUR ROYAL HOUSE
WILL LIVE WITH YOU

1828
02:05:05,161 --> 02:05:06,704
BUT DIE WITH ME.

1829
02:06:17,483 --> 02:06:19,735
DEAR CINDERELLA,
FORGIVE ME.

1830
02:06:21,987 --> 02:06:25,908
I HAVE NO HEART FOR WHAT
I MUST SHORTLY PERFORM.

1831
02:06:25,991 --> 02:06:28,994
MY HEART IS YOURS
AND YOURS ALONE.

1832
02:06:30,621 --> 02:06:35,543
I WOULD NOT HAVE YOU GRIEVE
FOR WHAT WAS NOT TO BE.

1833
02:06:35,584 --> 02:06:38,045
IT'S ONLY IN FAIRY TALES

1834
02:06:38,087 --> 02:06:40,506
THAT THE PRINCE...

1835
02:06:40,589 --> 02:06:43,092
MARRIES THE LADY
OF HIS CHOICE.

1836
02:06:43,134 --> 02:06:45,719
THE REAL WORLD
IS NOT SO KIND.

1837
02:06:45,761 --> 02:06:49,181
THERE ARE NO
PRIVATE KINGDOMS"

1838
02:06:49,265 --> 02:06:51,350
ONLY PUBLIC ONES.

1839
02:06:53,769 --> 02:06:55,729
I HAVE LOVED BUT ONCE.

1840
02:06:55,771 --> 02:06:58,190
I HAVE LOVED BUT YOU,

1841
02:06:58,274 --> 02:07:00,776
AND I HAVE LOST YOU TWICE.

1842
02:07:15,291 --> 02:07:24,800
I CAN'T FORGET
THE MELODY

1843
02:07:26,051 --> 02:07:35,519
ALTHOUGH OUR SONG
IS THROUGH

1844
02:07:36,854 --> 02:07:42,026
THE LOVE WE SHARED

1845
02:07:42,109 --> 02:07:47,114
THE DREAM WE DARED

1846
02:07:47,156 --> 02:07:52,161
WAS JUST A PRAYER
THAT CAN'T COME TRUE

1847
02:07:58,501 --> 02:08:03,506
I TRY TO STOP
REMEMBERING

1848
02:08:08,844 --> 02:08:18,479
BUT TILL THE DAY I DIE

1849
02:08:18,521 --> 02:08:26,195
WITHIN MY MEMORY

1850
02:08:26,237 --> 02:08:34,620
WILL LIVE THE MELODY

1851
02:08:34,662 --> 02:08:37,581
OF THE SONG

1852
02:08:37,665 --> 02:08:45,214
THAT WAS YOU AND ME

1853
02:08:49,718 --> 02:08:56,475
ALTHOUGH OUR SONG
IS THROUGH

1854
02:08:56,559 --> 02:09:04,692
I CAN'T STOP LOVING YOU

1855
02:09:04,733 --> 02:09:09,738
FOR I CAN'T FORGET
THE MELODY

1856
02:09:26,964 --> 02:09:30,384
AND WHAT, MIGHT I ASK,
ARE YOU DOING HERE?

1857
02:09:30,468 --> 02:09:31,886
OH, IT'S YOU.

1858
02:09:31,969 --> 02:09:33,888
YOU GAVE ME
SUCH A SHOCK.

1859
02:09:33,929 --> 02:09:35,389
I SHOULD HOPE So.

1860
02:09:35,473 --> 02:09:38,434
THAT IS NOTHING TO THE SHOCK
YOU'VE JUST GIVEN ME.

1861
02:09:38,476 --> 02:09:40,936
WHY, YOU SHOULDN'T
BE HERE AT ALL.

1862
02:09:40,978 --> 02:09:42,938
THAT'S NOT
HOW I PLANNED IT.

1863
02:09:42,980 --> 02:09:43,898
OH, REALLY!

1864
02:09:43,939 --> 02:09:46,317
I SOMETIMES WISH
I COULD RETIRE.

1865
02:09:46,400 --> 02:09:47,860
UNLESS I'M
ON THE SPOT

1866
02:09:47,943 --> 02:09:50,362
TO TAKE CARE OF
EVERY LITTLE DETAIL,

1867
02:09:50,446 --> 02:09:51,864
SOMETHING
ALWAYS GOES WRONG.

1868
02:09:51,906 --> 02:09:53,741
I KNOW EXACTLY
WHAT HAPPENED.

1869
02:09:53,783 --> 02:09:55,242
YOU STAYED BEYOND

1870
02:09:55,284 --> 02:09:57,244
THE STROKE OF
MIDNIGHT, DIDN'T YOU?

1871
02:09:57,286 --> 02:09:59,580
YES. OH, BUT PLEASE
DON'T SCOLD ME.

1872
02:09:59,622 --> 02:10:01,415
I'M UNHAPPY ENOUGH
AS IT IS.

1873
02:10:01,457 --> 02:10:02,917
WELL, OF COURSE,
YOU'RE UNHAPPY.

1874
02:10:03,000 --> 02:10:03,918
ANY GIRL
WOULD BE UNHAPPY

1875
02:10:03,959 --> 02:10:05,419
IF SHE WERE MISSING
HER OWN WEDDING.

1876
02:10:05,461 --> 02:10:06,420
WEDDING?

1877
02:10:06,462 --> 02:10:07,421
YES.

1878
02:10:07,463 --> 02:10:08,881
THE PRINCE GETS
MARRIED TODAY.

1879
02:10:08,964 --> 02:10:10,633
I HAD THE DATE
UNDERLINED IN MY DIARY.

1880
02:10:10,716 --> 02:10:14,595
WHY ELSE DO YOU SUPPOSE
I AM DRESSED LIKE THIS?

1881
02:10:14,637 --> 02:10:16,430
WHO...

1882
02:10:16,472 --> 02:10:18,224
WHO'S HE MARRYING?

1883
02:10:18,307 --> 02:10:21,227
WELL, AT THE MOMENT, THE
WRONG GIRL, OBVIOUSLY.

1884
02:10:21,310 --> 02:10:22,728
OH, IT'S
TOO IRRITATING.

1885
02:10:22,812 --> 02:10:25,731
I HAD IT
ALL MAPPED OUT.

1886
02:10:25,815 --> 02:10:29,735
WELL, I SUPPOSE I SHALL SIMPLY
HAVE TO RISE TO THE OCCASION

1887
02:10:29,819 --> 02:10:31,695
AND DO SOMETHING
SPECTACULAR YET AGAIN,

1888
02:10:31,779 --> 02:10:34,657
AND SPECTACULARS ALWAYS
TAKE So MUCH OUT OF ME.

1889
02:10:34,698 --> 02:10:36,534
JUST COME DOWN
OFF THE SWING.

1890
02:10:36,617 --> 02:10:39,036
IT WAS THE SAME
WITH SNOW WHITE.

1891
02:10:39,120 --> 02:10:40,538
ALL THE SAME,
YOU YOUNG GIRLS.

1892
02:10:40,663 --> 02:10:42,081
NEVER DO
AS YOU'RE TOLD.

1893
02:10:42,164 --> 02:10:43,582
MEN ARE MUCH EASIER.

1894
02:12:40,282 --> 02:12:43,119
OH, MAMA.

1895
02:13:43,095 --> 02:13:44,764
YOUR MAJESTY.

1896
02:13:44,847 --> 02:13:46,432
SIRE.

1897
02:13:54,315 --> 02:13:55,941
AHEM.

1898
02:13:56,025 --> 02:13:57,443
SIR.

1899
02:14:16,921 --> 02:14:17,880
AHEM !

1900
02:14:17,963 --> 02:14:19,089
OH...

1901
02:14:39,318 --> 02:14:42,029
King: WHAT CAN I SAY?
THIS Is, UH--

1902
02:14:42,071 --> 02:14:43,322
I CAN ASSURE YOU--

1903
02:14:43,405 --> 02:14:46,951
Father of bride: YOUR EXCUSE
IS ABSOLUTELY INADEQUATE.

1904
02:14:49,203 --> 02:14:51,539
AHH.

1905
02:14:51,580 --> 02:14:55,626
IS THE CEREMONY
OVER?

1906
02:14:55,668 --> 02:14:57,837
WHAT A RELIEF!

1907
02:14:57,878 --> 02:15:00,297
YOUR MAJESTY,
THIS COULD LEAD TO WAR.

1908
02:15:00,339 --> 02:15:01,966
I KNOW, I KNOW!
WELL, THINK OF SOMETHING!

1909
02:15:02,049 --> 02:15:03,300
HE CANNOT
MARRY HER, SIRE.

1910
02:15:03,342 --> 02:15:04,802
THE CONSTITUTION
DOES NOT ALLOW IT.

1911
02:15:04,885 --> 02:15:06,637
WELL, DON'T TELL ME.
I WROTE IT.

1912
02:15:06,720 --> 02:15:09,014
YES. DON'T TELL HIM.
HE WROTE IT.

1913
02:15:09,056 --> 02:15:10,766
I BEG YOUR
PARDOH, MADAM?

1914
02:15:10,850 --> 02:15:13,269
AND IF HE WROTE IT,
HE CAN UNWRITE IT.

1915
02:15:13,352 --> 02:15:14,812
DON'T YOU AGREE,
YOUR MAJESTY?

1916
02:15:14,895 --> 02:15:16,397
HE CAN WRITE
WHAT HE LIKES,

1917
02:15:16,439 --> 02:15:18,357
So LONG AS
HE CLEARS THIS ROOM.

1918
02:15:18,441 --> 02:15:21,819
THERE ARE TOO MANY
PEOPLE IN IT BY FAR,

1919
02:15:21,902 --> 02:15:24,822
MOST OF THEM
NOT WORTH A CANDLE.

1920
02:15:24,905 --> 02:15:26,365
AFTER ALL,
YOU ARE THE KING.

1921
02:15:26,407 --> 02:15:27,950
YES, THAT'S RIGHT. I AM!

1922
02:15:28,033 --> 02:15:29,994
AND ABSOLUTE MONARCHS
SHOULD ACT ABSOLUTELY.

1923
02:15:30,077 --> 02:15:31,495
IT'S VERY BECOMING.

1924
02:15:31,579 --> 02:15:32,955
SHE'S RIGHT
WHO IS SHE?

1925
02:15:33,038 --> 02:15:33,998
I'VE NO IDEA, SIRE.

1926
02:15:34,081 --> 02:15:36,000
SHE MUST BE
ONE OF THE VISITORS.

1927
02:15:36,083 --> 02:15:38,502
BUT EVEN IF YOU ALTER THE
CONSTITUTIOH, YOUR MAJESTY,

1928
02:15:38,586 --> 02:15:41,005
IT DOESN'T SOLVE THE PROBLEM
OF THE OTHER BRIDE.

1929
02:15:41,088 --> 02:15:42,840
No, YOU'RE RIGHT. SO WE'RE
BACK WHERE WE STARTED.

1930
02:15:42,882 --> 02:15:44,175
IT'S STARING YOU
IN THE FACE.

1931
02:15:44,258 --> 02:15:45,134
WHAT IS?

1932
02:15:45,176 --> 02:15:46,802
THE ANSWER.

1933
02:15:46,844 --> 02:15:48,804
King: WHAT SORT OF
AN ANSWER IS THAT?

1934
02:15:48,846 --> 02:15:50,139
Fairy Godmother:
THEY'RE IN LOVE!

1935
02:15:50,222 --> 02:15:51,182
THEY ARE?

1936
02:15:51,223 --> 02:15:52,767
IT WAS LOVE AT
FIRST SIGHT.

1937
02:15:52,850 --> 02:15:54,310
YOU HAVE MY WORD
FOR IT.

1938
02:15:54,351 --> 02:15:55,686
ASK HIM.

1939
02:15:58,689 --> 02:16:00,775
COUSIN...

1940
02:16:00,816 --> 02:16:03,652
COUSIN, IT HAS BEEN
BROUGHT TO MY NOTICE--

1941
02:16:03,694 --> 02:16:05,446
OH, YES. AND TO MINE.

1942
02:16:05,488 --> 02:16:07,281
ISN'T SHE RAVISHING?

1943
02:16:07,364 --> 02:16:09,158
BUT, UH, AM I
TO UNDERSTAND--

1944
02:16:09,200 --> 02:16:10,701
YES... ANYTHING.

1945
02:16:12,203 --> 02:16:13,996
Woman: IT REALLY
IS DISGRACEFUL.

1946
02:16:15,539 --> 02:16:19,960
WELL, WHAT CAN WE DO AS FATHERS
FACED WITH THIS VERY HUMAN DILEMMA?

1947
02:16:20,044 --> 02:16:21,837
IT'S A QUESTION
OF HONOR.

1948
02:16:21,879 --> 02:16:25,674
YES. WELL, IT WOULD SEEM IN ALL
THE CIRCUMSTANCES TO BE, UH...

1949
02:16:25,716 --> 02:16:27,092
AFAIT ACCOMPLI?

1950
02:16:27,176 --> 02:16:30,012
IT'S CERTAINLY
A FATE. HA HA.

1951
02:16:30,054 --> 02:16:31,180
THE YOUNGER GENERATION'S
SO FICKLE.

1952
02:16:31,222 --> 02:16:33,140
NOT LIKE US,
NO SENSE OF DUTY,

1953
02:16:33,182 --> 02:16:34,308
NO SENSE OF HISTORY.

1954
02:16:34,391 --> 02:16:38,687
SPEAKING FOR MYSELF,
I HAD A SWORD IN MY BACK.

1955
02:16:38,729 --> 02:16:40,147
YOU, TOO?

1956
02:16:40,231 --> 02:16:41,524
WELL, THAT'S WHAT I MEAN.

1957
02:16:41,565 --> 02:16:43,692
WE NEVER SHIRKED
OUR RESPONSIBILITIES.

1958
02:16:43,734 --> 02:16:46,654
SO, WHAT'S IT TO BE?

1959
02:16:46,737 --> 02:16:49,448
WELL, IT LOOKS LIKE
ANOTHER WEDDING.

1960
02:16:49,532 --> 02:16:52,660
YES. IT LOOKS
LIKE THAT.

1961
02:16:52,701 --> 02:16:54,703
CAN I SPEAK
AS MAN TO MAN?

1962
02:16:54,745 --> 02:16:55,788
I'D WELCOME IT.

1963
02:16:55,830 --> 02:17:00,835
HE'S, UH, NOT WHAT
I WANTED, BUT, us...

1964
02:17:00,876 --> 02:17:03,170
THEN NEITHER
WAS SHE.

1965
02:17:03,212 --> 02:17:04,964
OH, CHARMING GIRL!

PLENTY OF SPIRIT.

1967
