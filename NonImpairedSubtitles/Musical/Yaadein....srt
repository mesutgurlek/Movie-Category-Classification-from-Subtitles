0
00:01:30,175 --> 00:01:37,178
Back in India, after 25 years
in London, yet pure Hindustani

1
00:01:54,366 --> 00:01:56,055
London...

2
00:02:10,248 --> 00:02:12,939
A home there...

3
00:02:14,720 --> 00:02:17,149
a home here

4
00:02:22,160 --> 00:02:24,418
Shalini

5
00:02:38,076 --> 00:02:40,767
Happy birthday, my love

6
00:02:41,079 --> 00:02:44,649
The priest gave me a garland of flowers...

7
00:02:44,650 --> 00:02:47,113
for your portrait

8
00:02:47,753 --> 00:02:51,854
But garlands are for those
who have departed

9
00:02:52,658 --> 00:02:56,919
But you haven't departed, you're with me...

10
00:02:57,763 --> 00:03:00,454
with me, every moment

11
00:04:16,608 --> 00:04:19,208
No, no news of Sanya

12
00:04:20,078 --> 00:04:22,211
It's past three am

13
00:04:22,581 --> 00:04:25,272
Let me check out the house once again

14
00:04:49,474 --> 00:04:52,076
Where have you been?
- Friend's birthday

15
00:04:52,077 --> 00:04:55,007
I went out for a party.
- You know what time it is?

16
00:04:59,184 --> 00:05:02,686
Aren't you ashamed? For four hours,
I've been looking for you

17
00:05:02,687 --> 00:05:07,691
Why? I'm not a kid! Go to bed, Papa.
We'll talk in the morning

18
00:05:07,692 --> 00:05:10,383
Why not now?

19
00:05:21,173 --> 00:05:25,138
You've been drinking alcohol?
- Not alcohol. Just wine

20
00:05:31,616 --> 00:05:34,079
I told you! Let's talk
in the morning

21
00:05:36,454 --> 00:05:41,682
Else I'll complain to the police,
I'll report you

22
00:05:51,937 --> 00:05:54,229
Are you out of your mind?

23
00:06:28,707 --> 00:06:31,041
For the children, I'm no friend...

24
00:06:31,042 --> 00:06:34,404
unless I have answers for their questions

25
00:06:34,713 --> 00:06:37,715
Drinking coke, in the store?
- Why not?

26
00:06:37,716 --> 00:06:40,851
I know it's your weakness,
I've stocked up on Coke

27
00:06:40,852 --> 00:06:44,054
Not one, I have two weaknesses.
One's this, the other is...

28
00:06:44,055 --> 00:06:46,746
your soft, lovely tresses

29
00:06:47,058 --> 00:06:50,420
Besides, this is the best coolant
for my hot head

30
00:06:51,062 --> 00:06:55,425
Coolant for your hot head is also
this. Look at this greeting card

31
00:06:56,801 --> 00:06:58,736
Sanskrit shloke

32
00:06:58,737 --> 00:07:03,807
The only time I heard Sanskrit,
was the only time I spoke Sanskrit

33
00:07:03,808 --> 00:07:07,077
And that was during my wedding,
and then the priest...

34
00:07:07,078 --> 00:07:10,681
recited the mumbo-jumbo
and thence on...

35
00:07:10,682 --> 00:07:14,374
to Buckingham, Birmingham, and all over

36
00:07:16,688 --> 00:07:22,359
You are the scholar,
you are the Oxford professor

37
00:07:22,360 --> 00:07:25,790
Better you translate that for me

38
00:07:34,439 --> 00:07:36,401
Meaning...?

39
00:07:37,042 --> 00:07:43,647
Till the age of five,
children are to be loved

40
00:07:43,715 --> 00:07:48,078
After they turn ten, you ought
to keep an eye on them

41
00:07:48,720 --> 00:07:53,413
Once that have reached sixteen,
you ought to make friends with them

42
00:07:54,726 --> 00:08:02,099
Get that, love? At sixteen, make
friends. That's if you want...

43
00:08:02,100 --> 00:08:05,030
a happy home, forever

44
00:08:05,670 --> 00:08:09,173
Old hat.
- Also today's new message

45
00:08:09,174 --> 00:08:10,808
Striking a friendship with my daughters!

46
00:08:10,809 --> 00:08:14,637
For a father like me!
In an alien land...

47
00:08:16,014 --> 00:08:18,705
Return the trolley.
I'll be in the car

48
00:09:42,133 --> 00:09:45,563
Sorry, we're switching off life support

49
00:10:01,453 --> 00:10:04,144
How can this be?

50
00:10:05,990 --> 00:10:09,818
The doctor gives me only
2 or 3 minutes to talk to you

51
00:10:13,131 --> 00:10:17,096
No love, I'm with you

52
00:10:20,004 --> 00:10:23,969
In 25 years, I haven't even taken
a breath without depending on you

53
00:10:24,642 --> 00:10:28,903
You've taken care of everything...
what am I to do?

54
00:10:30,148 --> 00:10:33,715
The homes, the daughters...

55
00:10:35,820 --> 00:10:39,580
how am I to take care of them?
What will I talk to them about?

56
00:10:42,861 --> 00:10:45,119
You will...

57
00:10:46,764 --> 00:10:51,867
you are their mother, Papa too

58
00:10:54,105 --> 00:11:00,334
Just promise me one thing.
- Tell me, love

59
00:11:01,713 --> 00:11:07,908
Till they are married,
don't stay away from them...

60
00:11:08,620 --> 00:11:11,083
be friends with them

61
00:11:11,189 --> 00:11:15,792
How will I do it, love?
Ever since they have grew up...

62
00:11:15,793 --> 00:11:18,195
I haven't even had a simple
conversation with them

63
00:11:18,196 --> 00:11:21,421
Remember that Sanskrit shloke?

64
00:11:22,734 --> 00:11:25,231
Yes

65
00:11:33,745 --> 00:11:36,709
Give happy farewells to our three daughters

66
00:11:38,183 --> 00:11:40,441
Understand them...

67
00:11:41,653 --> 00:11:44,253
give them understanding

68
00:12:51,990 --> 00:12:56,251
There! I've slapped you.
Come to the police

69
00:12:56,394 --> 00:12:58,322
Report me

70
00:13:05,703 --> 00:13:08,705
If not with me, your friend of 25 years...

71
00:13:08,706 --> 00:13:12,204
with whom will you open up?

72
00:13:12,710 --> 00:13:17,403
You're my kin. Before who else,
can I bare my heart?

73
00:13:17,782 --> 00:13:20,550
Stop bickering over every small thing

74
00:13:20,551 --> 00:13:23,412
So what if they're daughters?
The world is full of daughters

75
00:13:24,622 --> 00:13:27,882
If he can't, well he can't

76
00:13:28,726 --> 00:13:31,828
If you're my son's best friend,
why can't you be best friends...

77
00:13:31,829 --> 00:13:36,898
with your daughters?
- L.K... daughters are different

78
00:13:41,072 --> 00:13:43,763
What will you do then?

79
00:13:44,909 --> 00:13:49,602
I'm thinking of returning to India,
for a change of enviromnent

80
00:13:49,747 --> 00:13:53,439
For a father, playing mother is tough

81
00:14:01,693 --> 00:14:04,384
Kids these days!

82
00:14:06,564 --> 00:14:09,596
Ever since he was a child...
I put Ronit away in a hostel

83
00:14:12,603 --> 00:14:18,741
That's why I left mine in Lahore.
Kids, stay where you belong

84
00:14:48,740 --> 00:14:54,411
Beat me up. Give me a bad beating.
I had gone crazy

85
00:14:54,412 --> 00:15:00,448
No my baby, you're my best

86
00:15:03,621 --> 00:15:11,523
Papa, we three have promised never
to make you unhappy, never to fight

87
00:15:18,770 --> 00:15:24,203
It's all my fault children,
it's all my fault

88
00:15:26,577 --> 00:15:31,737
Now I understand what a great friend
your mother was to you

89
00:15:33,818 --> 00:15:38,648
The father is merely the provider
of money, comforts

90
00:15:39,724 --> 00:15:43,059
But the mother...

91
00:15:43,060 --> 00:15:47,218
like a friend, she shares
your woes, your sorrows

92
00:15:48,166 --> 00:15:50,493
I tried

93
00:15:50,735 --> 00:15:54,738
Yes, I tried, but I failed...

94
00:15:54,739 --> 00:16:00,433
to understand you, your feelings

95
00:16:05,983 --> 00:16:12,679
No Papa. Now that Ma is gone,
you are our friend

96
00:16:14,625 --> 00:16:17,850
We'll do whatever you say

97
00:16:28,139 --> 00:16:33,401
For me today, the only true East
where the sun rises, is my India

98
00:16:42,720 --> 00:16:48,058
The departure of my dear friend Raj
for India, leaves London deserted

99
00:16:48,059 --> 00:16:52,092
My friend, he's gone.
- Start worrying about your son

100
00:16:52,396 --> 00:16:56,759
Off he goes to India, right behind Raj?

101
00:16:57,835 --> 00:17:03,871
Simple sweetheart. For him,
Raj is father, mother and friend

102
00:17:03,908 --> 00:17:08,100
Sure! You and I aren't
his parents at all

103
00:17:08,145 --> 00:17:11,541
We are, only for namesake

104
00:17:16,153 --> 00:17:22,052
Ronit is the son of Raj and Shalini,
in thought, in mind, in nature

105
00:17:23,027 --> 00:17:26,924
Which is why, he's so middle-class

106
00:17:29,433 --> 00:17:34,604
And he leaves this palatial house
and sets up studio! Dance, music...

107
00:17:34,605 --> 00:17:38,866
Mohobbat.com!
- An artiste, he's an artiste

108
00:18:18,983 --> 00:18:21,918
Indian music ties millions of
Asian Indians across the world...

109
00:18:21,919 --> 00:18:24,109
in a single thread

110
00:18:26,023 --> 00:18:29,624
The end of all quarrels over
race and creed? Indian music

111
00:18:31,195 --> 00:18:35,228
Teaches one language to Punjabis,
Marathis, Gujaratis, Bengalis...?

112
00:18:36,701 --> 00:18:39,665
Makes every Indian a global Indian...?

113
00:18:40,771 --> 00:18:44,608
For friendships, love, marriages...

114
00:18:44,609 --> 00:18:48,745
Iog on to our dotcom,
cdguru.com

115
00:18:54,452 --> 00:18:59,248
Ronit, Raj uncle called for you.
He has emailed too. Read it

116
00:19:05,196 --> 00:19:07,464
After Coke-Mohobbat.com...

117
00:19:07,465 --> 00:19:10,834
we aren't accepting sponsorships for
anything less than 500,000 dollars

118
00:19:10,835 --> 00:19:12,934
If they agree, okay

119
00:19:26,017 --> 00:19:33,850
Sorry for coming away to India without
telling. Lalit will tell you why

120
00:19:34,692 --> 00:19:37,383
Sorry pal, I had too.
You must've understood

121
00:19:39,964 --> 00:19:46,398
Pointess telling you that we miss you.
We keep talking about you

122
00:19:46,771 --> 00:19:48,805
Just today I was telling
Isha and Avantika...

123
00:19:48,806 --> 00:19:53,738
about the incident in your college,
when Shalini and I were visiting you

124
00:19:54,612 --> 00:19:59,408
You had just been awarded the trophy
for the best student in the college

125
00:19:59,717 --> 00:20:05,218
You sidetracked Lalit and Nalini,
and you headed straight for me

126
00:20:05,523 --> 00:20:10,421
You forgot your parents and
you touched Shalini's feet

127
00:20:11,162 --> 00:20:18,859
Lalit was so jealous! I remember.
And it made Shalini double-happy

128
00:20:22,740 --> 00:20:29,106
With memories like these we're trying
to sette down to our new lives

129
00:20:29,480 --> 00:20:33,240
In any case, Isha is returning
to London to complete her studies

130
00:20:33,684 --> 00:20:39,913
Take care of yourself, Ronit.
Your best friend, Uncle Raj.

"Memories"

144
00:24:00,157 --> 00:24:02,191
There are loves

145
00:24:02,192 --> 00:24:04,394
There are griefs

146
00:24:04,395 --> 00:24:06,195
There are tales

147
00:24:06,196 --> 00:24:08,386
There are words

148
00:24:08,699 --> 00:24:11,000
Words are forgotten

149
00:24:11,001 --> 00:24:13,396
Memories return

150
00:24:14,438 --> 00:24:20,735
Memories of the loved ones come back
once they have departed

151
00:24:21,712 --> 00:24:23,913
Oh these memories...

152
00:24:23,914 --> 00:24:26,605
alas memories...

153
00:24:30,721 --> 00:24:35,755
"All of us, in our worlds..."

00:24:56,747 --> 00:24:59,438
"sweet memories"

159
00:24:59,750 --> 00:25:02,384
"bittersweet memories..."

160
00:25:03,354 --> 00:25:06,022
"of loves..."

161
00:25:06,023 --> 00:25:08,714
"of griefs..."

162
00:25:09,026 --> 00:25:10,860
"of tales..."

163
00:25:10,861 --> 00:25:14,394
"of words..."

164
00:25:14,698 --> 00:25:19,664
"of words forgotten..."

165
00:25:20,704 --> 00:25:25,670
"but memories return..."

166
00:25:25,709 --> 00:25:31,403
"memories cherished,
of beloved ones..."

167
00:25:31,548 --> 00:25:37,413
"returning once they're gone"

168
00:26:14,591 --> 00:26:17,191
New York, Mr Black

169
00:26:24,701 --> 00:26:30,706
Our shares were down till yesterday,
not today. Just you watch...

170
00:26:30,707 --> 00:26:35,711
by Monday next, they're going
to peak. Yes, we're praying...

171
00:26:35,712 --> 00:26:40,542
to the Goddess of Fortunes. Now
she will grace my home

172
00:26:41,151 --> 00:26:43,842
You tell that to those mutual funds

173
00:26:46,924 --> 00:26:49,091
Join us for the prayers

174
00:26:50,327 --> 00:26:54,758
Your uncle is very angry.
Come, say the prayer

175
00:26:55,732 --> 00:26:58,835
An artiste! That's what your son is.
Does he know how important it is...

176
00:26:58,836 --> 00:27:04,207
to propitiate the Goddess of Fortunes?
- How could I? Till last year...

177
00:27:04,208 --> 00:27:06,476
you were trying to propitiate
the Goddess of Bounty

178
00:27:06,477 --> 00:27:11,170
Worship didn't bear fruit.
Therefore... change

179
00:27:12,082 --> 00:27:16,786
The pundits say that he fell foul
of the Goddess of Fortunes last year

180
00:27:16,787 --> 00:27:23,126
Worship done, She will be placated.
- The Goddess has been invoked

181
00:27:23,127 --> 00:27:26,387
Seek and you shall be given

182
00:27:28,098 --> 00:27:31,198
Really?
- Seek, then see

183
00:27:32,703 --> 00:27:35,064
Do I speak out what I seek?

184
00:27:35,305 --> 00:27:37,666
As you wish

185
00:27:40,978 --> 00:27:44,408
O'Goddess of Fortunes...
You are the Mother of all

186
00:27:45,048 --> 00:27:48,808
The mighty, the lowly, the rich,
the poor, are all devoted to You

187
00:27:50,220 --> 00:27:53,320
The millions of poor in India worship You

188
00:27:53,857 --> 00:27:56,548
Then why do You not go there
to eradicate their poverty?

189
00:27:57,728 --> 00:28:03,365
Over here, we are all so rich.
What use Your staying here?

190
00:28:04,668 --> 00:28:09,236
O'Mother, desert the rich, go to the poor

191
00:28:09,673 --> 00:28:12,364
All of India awaits Thee

192
00:28:15,445 --> 00:28:21,139
Actually we're all fine here.
Quite fine

193
00:28:22,686 --> 00:28:25,377
All we need are Your blessings

194
00:28:28,158 --> 00:28:31,850
Ma, I'm going to call Uncle Raj.
Go on with the prayers

195
00:28:34,097 --> 00:28:38,367
Saw your son's insolence?
That's the result of...

196
00:28:38,368 --> 00:28:41,059
not keeping children on a leash

197
00:28:47,878 --> 00:28:52,810
You should be ashamed! Such insolence?
- Because I said the truth?

198
00:28:54,051 --> 00:28:58,209
God isn't meant to be propitiated for
purposes. A prayer should be heartfelt

199
00:29:00,657 --> 00:29:04,349
Where to, now?
- To Uncle Raj

200
00:29:05,262 --> 00:29:09,227
Your friend, he is.
But his heart, I know

201
00:29:10,200 --> 00:29:14,670
Just think. After all these years
abroad, what drives him homeward...

202
00:29:14,671 --> 00:29:19,705
is sheer agony. If we aren't the ones
to share his sorrows, who else will?

203
00:29:32,489 --> 00:29:36,692
Nalini, who bore Ronit?
You, or Shalini?

204
00:29:36,693 --> 00:29:39,384
Oh brother-in-law...!

205
00:29:42,966 --> 00:29:48,126
Your mother always said that after
all of you were married off...

206
00:29:48,171 --> 00:29:52,041
she wanted both of us to retire,
and come to live in India...

207
00:29:52,042 --> 00:29:59,949
here, in this farm house. And when
it's about time, she leaves, saying...

208
00:29:59,950 --> 00:30:04,416
Not their Papa, be their friend "Papa"

209
00:30:04,655 --> 00:30:09,849
Ma was 500 percent right!
- Papa, where did you first meet her?

210
00:30:10,827 --> 00:30:16,157
And who said "I love you" first?
You or Mamma? Please, tell us

211
00:30:16,266 --> 00:30:18,067
I did

212
00:30:18,068 --> 00:30:24,640
Tell us, when did Mummy say
"I love you" for the first time?

213
00:30:24,641 --> 00:30:26,642
You're going too far.

214
00:30:26,643 --> 00:30:30,938
On one hand, you want to be Papa-friend!
On the other hand, just look at you...

215
00:30:31,148 --> 00:30:36,485
Can you tell me, what if someone
says something romantically...?

216
00:30:36,486 --> 00:30:40,917
What romance? The fellow
who does that gets slapped

217
00:30:41,425 --> 00:30:43,990
Just get married and push off

218
00:30:45,762 --> 00:30:47,863
What Papa means is that
if something like that happens...

219
00:30:47,864 --> 00:30:50,464
first of all, we'll tell Papa

220
00:30:55,105 --> 00:31:02,404
Today, on my birthday, let's give each
other a promise as friends. An agreement

221
00:31:06,183 --> 00:31:09,215
Didn't get that.
- No need to get worked up

222
00:31:10,721 --> 00:31:14,724
What I mean to say is,
sometime or the other...

223
00:31:14,725 --> 00:31:20,730
somewhere or the other, there will
surely come into your lives...

224
00:31:20,731 --> 00:31:25,765
a boy who wants to marry you,
whom you want to marry

225
00:31:25,802 --> 00:31:29,437
What's wrong with that Papa?
- When did I say anything's wrong?

226
00:31:29,639 --> 00:31:34,435
All I'm saying is, you have every
right to marry, and I'll concede too

227
00:31:35,412 --> 00:31:38,103
But...

228
00:31:38,548 --> 00:31:43,753
remember one thing. The right to choose
the family he comes from...

229
00:31:43,754 --> 00:31:47,556
will be mine, completely mine.
You'll give me so much, won't you?

230
00:31:47,557 --> 00:31:52,250
Why Papa?
- How naive, my child!

231
00:31:52,562 --> 00:31:57,596
You won't be marrying only the boy

232
00:31:58,168 --> 00:32:01,393
You will be marrying into the family

233
00:32:01,605 --> 00:32:04,874
The entire family. Right?

234
00:32:04,875 --> 00:32:10,410
Papa is absolutely right!
Condition accepted, what?

235
00:32:12,082 --> 00:32:16,946
Today, let's make a promise
to ourselves, as friends

236
00:32:17,454 --> 00:32:21,749
To talk from the heart, with an open mind

237
00:32:22,058 --> 00:32:25,420
Let's be a well-knit,
friendly family

238
00:32:40,010 --> 00:32:43,838
Avantika rustes up the fries
and the sweets, fast!

239
00:32:44,648 --> 00:32:47,782
No fries, no sweets. First,
give us a song

240
00:32:48,752 --> 00:32:52,012
Which song?
- Our favourite one

241
00:33:52,649 --> 00:33:55,249
You left me all alone and came to India

242
00:33:56,486 --> 00:33:58,653
I know you would come

243
00:33:58,855 --> 00:34:01,352
You come to India, you forget!
Not even a phone call...?

244
00:34:26,650 --> 00:34:28,551
Idiot, remember me?

245
00:34:28,552 --> 00:34:31,083
All forgotten

246
00:34:49,973 --> 00:34:52,834
Our memories,
Coke-Mohobbat.com

247
00:34:53,810 --> 00:34:58,914
The whole world has turned into
one dotcom, which draws closer...

248
00:34:58,915 --> 00:35:01,310
Indians in every corner of the world

249
00:35:05,399 --> 00:35:09,803
Those who don't want to fall in love,
can get married straightaway

250
00:35:09,804 --> 00:35:13,173
How come?
- Consider yourself. Assuming...

251
00:35:13,174 --> 00:35:17,077
we are to choose for you, a handsome worthy

252
00:35:17,078 --> 00:35:23,045
Our "Shaadi.com" can tell you where
and how to find the most suitable boy

253
00:35:24,218 --> 00:35:29,756
Now you come to the point! Tell us.
- Computer, advise us where to find...

254
00:35:29,757 --> 00:35:32,726
a suitable, handsome boy,
the right match for Avantika

255
00:35:32,727 --> 00:35:34,792
Here you are

256
00:35:37,732 --> 00:35:39,592
3 boys

257
00:35:40,101 --> 00:35:42,635
I like all three

258
00:35:42,636 --> 00:35:45,065
Let's get all three married off

259
00:35:50,111 --> 00:35:56,149
The boy in the middle is Pankaj.
Pankaj Kudesia. I know him

260
00:35:56,150 --> 00:35:58,885
How come?
- We studied together In London

261
00:35:58,886 --> 00:36:02,255
Presenty, he's a vice president
with Hotel Surya in Delhi

262
00:36:02,256 --> 00:36:05,754
He was in London, but he stayed Indian

263
00:36:06,961 --> 00:36:10,755
Well Avantika?
- Not I

264
00:36:10,931 --> 00:36:14,156
There's a boy for Sanya too.
Take a look

265
00:36:24,779 --> 00:36:27,276
Find someone for our Isha too

266
00:36:29,350 --> 00:36:32,041
Scan Isha into the computer

267
00:36:32,887 --> 00:36:34,918
Here we go

268
00:36:54,208 --> 00:36:56,535
What was that?

269
00:37:11,058 --> 00:37:14,488
Talk to the groomspeople clearly, openly

270
00:37:14,862 --> 00:37:21,933
You know Isha, I can't take this
"Hahn-ji, Nan-ji" small-talk

271
00:37:22,169 --> 00:37:25,638
What scant pluck I have is because
I have Ronit with me. Else...

272
00:37:25,639 --> 00:37:31,777
What can Ronit do? He's a baby.
Elders talk to each other

273
00:37:32,079 --> 00:37:35,615
Stop depending on him.
- But I...

274
00:37:35,616 --> 00:37:42,489
TIMEOUT: 01:37:36:05 Not buts to yourself

275
00:37:42,490 --> 00:37:46,893
Mr Raj, Ronit is to me
what my son Pankaj is

276
00:37:46,894 --> 00:37:51,197
Ronit has told us everything
about Avantika. All I wanted...

277
00:37:51,198 --> 00:37:55,768
was to meet you. Now we've met.
- Me too... what I wanted...

278
00:37:55,769 --> 00:38:00,340
What I wanted, Ronit...
- What he wanted was to meet you...

279
00:38:00,341 --> 00:38:06,206
and ask you... you know wedding matters
...if you have any conditions, demands

280
00:38:06,380 --> 00:38:11,608
Exacty! Whatever it be, be sure
to ask. I'll fulfill everything

281
00:38:13,053 --> 00:38:19,392
Decent parents, a good girl and
a simple wedding... my 3 conditions

282
00:38:19,393 --> 00:38:24,397
Nothing more.
- Yes, and have nothing to worry

283
00:38:24,398 --> 00:38:28,067
At home with us, Avantika won't face
the slightest hardship

284
00:38:28,068 --> 00:38:30,929
That's exacty what I meant

285
00:38:34,141 --> 00:38:38,077
Well, have I been talking excessively?
- Not a question of excesses

286
00:38:38,078 --> 00:38:42,348
All I've been trying to tell him
is to make a clean breast

287
00:38:42,349 --> 00:38:46,246
One colour, you know.
Differing shades create problems

288
00:38:46,520 --> 00:38:51,457
Black or white. If it's black,
let it be black, completely

289
00:38:51,458 --> 00:38:58,198
If it's white, let it be all-white.
But some people will ruin...

290
00:38:58,199 --> 00:39:02,268
the best of situations, trying
to mix black with white

291
00:39:02,269 --> 00:39:06,973
That's where the confusion arises,
and confusion leads to problems

292
00:39:06,974 --> 00:39:11,075
And for every problem, finding
a solution is tough, if handy

293
00:39:12,346 --> 00:39:15,048
Thanks to good company, we have a solution

294
00:39:15,049 --> 00:39:18,741
One must be alert, but no problem...

295
00:39:19,720 --> 00:39:21,887
everything can be solved

296
00:39:25,159 --> 00:39:28,419
How about tea or something?
It's been quite long

297
00:39:30,965 --> 00:39:36,402
How long have you been working here?
- Uncle Khama isn't a servant...

298
00:39:36,403 --> 00:39:39,094
he's Daddy's friend of 35 years.

299
00:39:39,473 --> 00:39:42,164
He owns a golf club

300
00:39:55,322 --> 00:40:00,356
As good as servant. Mohanlal demands
loyalty from his friends

301
00:40:02,429 --> 00:40:07,259
Enough! Let me leave before
another faux pas

302
00:40:07,701 --> 00:40:10,596
And look at my litte master staring me down

303
00:40:11,372 --> 00:40:15,667
Because of your cross-matched socks

304
00:40:47,041 --> 00:40:52,644
"What riddle is this?"

305
00:40:57,351 --> 00:41:03,114
"Why are such strange things
happening?"

306
00:41:18,105 --> 00:41:23,799
"My restessness..."

307
00:41:26,113 --> 00:41:31,184
"My restessness, my loneliness"

308
00:41:31,185 --> 00:41:36,151
"In my restessness I am so lonely"

309
00:42:26,907 --> 00:42:33,112
"What strange breeze blows
this year?"

310
00:42:33,113 --> 00:42:39,217
"Try as much as I will,
but my feet are unsteady"

311
00:42:41,121 --> 00:42:47,260
"Why do these thoughts
cross my heart...?"

312
00:42:47,261 --> 00:42:53,831
"When I see my friends
wearing the hema...?"

313
00:42:58,472 --> 00:43:04,109
"Makes me wish I could wear it too"

314
00:43:09,049 --> 00:43:13,986
"What riddle is this?"

315
00:43:13,987 --> 00:43:19,681
"Why are such strange things
happening?"

316
00:43:36,410 --> 00:43:42,548
"The days are too short,
these nights too long"

317
00:43:42,549 --> 00:43:49,154
"Before the monsoons it has begun raining"

318
00:43:50,591 --> 00:43:56,596
"In my dreams I have met someone"

319
00:43:56,597 --> 00:44:03,361
"Go away! Don't teach me
these strange things"

320
00:44:08,008 --> 00:44:13,145
"The two of you have killed me"

321
00:44:13,146 --> 00:44:18,150
"What riddle is this?"

322
00:44:18,151 --> 00:44:23,788
"Why are such strange things
happening?"

323
00:44:51,018 --> 00:44:57,350
"This is no picture, this is a message"

324
00:44:57,457 --> 00:45:03,754
"From far away, someone
sends you greetings"

325
00:45:05,332 --> 00:45:11,766
"He's handsome, he has a cute name"

326
00:45:11,772 --> 00:45:18,069
"And good friends bring hearts close"

327
00:45:22,883 --> 00:45:28,384
"One of you is to be a bride"

328
00:45:33,093 --> 00:45:38,097
"What riddle is this?"

329
00:45:38,098 --> 00:45:43,792
"Why are such strange things
happening?"

330
00:48:16,156 --> 00:48:21,316
Cycles have brakes, you know?
- Off to London without a bye-bye?

331
00:48:21,394 --> 00:48:25,331
But I met everyone.
- Except me, idiot

332
00:48:25,332 --> 00:48:30,069
Didn't think it necessary.
Idiot, you were busy working out

333
00:48:30,070 --> 00:48:35,074
I would've missed my plane.
Hey, did you miss me?

334
00:48:35,075 --> 00:48:37,209
Not at all!

335
00:48:37,210 --> 00:48:41,437
On the day of the wedding, Papa gave
me a gift for you. I forgot about it

336
00:48:42,082 --> 00:48:44,773
Here's your message

337
00:48:45,252 --> 00:48:52,118
Your gift. From Papa. Not from me.
- From Papa?

338
00:48:53,061 --> 00:48:55,752
You can put it on, can't you?

339
00:49:04,572 --> 00:49:08,264
I've seen two nice boys
on my "shaadi.com"

340
00:49:08,676 --> 00:49:12,675
One for Sanya, one for you

341
00:49:13,581 --> 00:49:15,680
For me?

342
00:49:17,318 --> 00:49:20,282
Why?
- I don't want to marry

343
00:49:21,055 --> 00:49:25,020
Until when?
- Until college is over

344
00:49:25,593 --> 00:49:30,797
And afterwwards?
- I'll do whatever Papa says

345
00:49:30,798 --> 00:49:35,702
Marriage, or love-marriage?
- I don't believe in love

346
00:49:35,703 --> 00:49:38,633
I know. But why?

347
00:49:39,607 --> 00:49:44,243
Romantics are useless.
They're filmi

348
00:49:45,179 --> 00:49:49,178
In real life, love's an entertaimnent
package that comes with youth

349
00:49:51,519 --> 00:49:55,814
When girls like you fall in love,
great love stories are made

350
00:50:00,528 --> 00:50:05,324
Girls like me only make history,
not love stories

351
00:50:08,536 --> 00:50:13,974
Remember, there will come the day,
when a handsome young man...

352
00:50:13,975 --> 00:50:20,341
will move you to tears.
That day, your love story begins

353
00:50:37,064 --> 00:50:41,359
That will happen, that will surely happen

354
00:50:47,375 --> 00:50:51,374
I ask you, who is this boy?
Who is he?

355
00:50:51,679 --> 00:50:57,083
Papa, he's Sukant. I've known him
for a year. He lives in Delhi

356
00:50:57,084 --> 00:51:02,022
And I'm in love with him.
- But I've seen him...

357
00:51:02,023 --> 00:51:04,748
in the company of ruffians.
Outside our house in London

358
00:51:05,626 --> 00:51:09,454
Yes Papa, but Sukant is very good at heart

359
00:51:10,631 --> 00:51:17,737
Besides, we've decided to marry.
- So decisions have been taken already?

360
00:51:17,738 --> 00:51:20,338
Then who needs me?

361
00:51:24,011 --> 00:51:28,044
At least I should have the right
to choose my husband

362
00:51:44,665 --> 00:51:48,357
Oh! Love-romance.com...?

363
00:51:54,609 --> 00:52:02,545
Look, your daughter loves our son.
- And our son loves us both

364
00:52:02,617 --> 00:52:07,048
He's our only son. We got him educate
in London, and he's just back

365
00:52:07,622 --> 00:52:12,826
You know Mr Raj, we received
so many proposals for our son

366
00:52:12,827 --> 00:52:18,498
But we refused all of them.
- In this case, the kids are in love

367
00:52:18,499 --> 00:52:23,602
Hang love! My son is a gem

368
00:52:24,138 --> 00:52:27,705
Your daughter is lovely too.
She'd be lovelier if she wore clothes

369
00:52:29,043 --> 00:52:33,611
Mamma please, don't overdo it.
- I'm not! This concerns marriage

370
00:52:33,648 --> 00:52:38,919
We ought to talk openly, yes Mr Raj?
- Even I want you to talk openly

371
00:52:38,920 --> 00:52:40,921
I'm open!

372
00:52:40,922 --> 00:52:45,992
We aren't lusting for a dowry.
- We have no objection...

373
00:52:45,993 --> 00:52:50,230
to whatever you wish to give
your daughter, no objection at all

374
00:52:50,231 --> 00:52:54,467
We don't want suits, clothes, nothing!
- But the wedding venue must be...

375
00:52:54,468 --> 00:53:00,674
a five-star hotel. Hotel Surya!
Those with a standing do it in style

376
00:53:00,675 --> 00:53:04,611
The relationship doesn't end with
the wedding. The exchange continues...

377
00:53:04,612 --> 00:53:07,614
even after the wedding.
- After the wedding begins...

378
00:53:07,615 --> 00:53:11,307
the real relationship.
Comings-goings keep happening

379
00:53:12,186 --> 00:53:16,583
But we aren't greedy, not at all

380
00:53:17,024 --> 00:53:23,185
Uncle, you haven't eaten anything...?
- No son, not hungry. I'm in a hurry

381
00:53:23,397 --> 00:53:25,065
That's all?

382
00:53:25,066 --> 00:53:27,324
I enjoy this

383
00:53:27,435 --> 00:53:31,638
I don't understand! Who am I to marry?
Sukant or his family?

384
00:53:31,639 --> 00:53:35,742
That's what I'm trying to tell you
again and again! After the wedding...

385
00:53:35,743 --> 00:53:38,673
you aren't going to be called
neither Juliet-in-love nor Mrs Sukant

386
00:53:39,246 --> 00:53:44,451
After the marriage, you'll be called,
sister-in-law, daughter-in-law, aunt...

387
00:53:44,452 --> 00:53:46,987
and you will have to live up to all
those relationships. And his family...

388
00:53:46,988 --> 00:53:51,658
isn't worthy of you!
- You just don't want me to be happy

389
00:53:51,659 --> 00:53:56,396
This I've come to know. But I've taken
the decision about my life. Period

390
00:53:56,397 --> 00:53:59,088
Then hear out my decision too

391
00:54:05,506 --> 00:54:08,299
Saw that? Heard that?

392
00:54:19,620 --> 00:54:23,721
I've got to know everything.
Let me talk to her

393
00:54:28,029 --> 00:54:33,723
For a father, handling daughters
is so problematic

394
00:54:43,577 --> 00:54:45,712
Where do they come from?

395
00:54:45,713 --> 00:54:48,677
Leave me! I don't want to live!

396
00:54:48,916 --> 00:54:51,518
Why are you crying?
- Sanya doused herself with kerosene

397
00:54:51,519 --> 00:54:54,084
She's trying to set herself afire!

398
00:54:54,555 --> 00:54:58,224
Leave me! Let me die!
I want to go to my mother!

399
00:54:58,225 --> 00:55:01,795
Have you gone out of your mind?
- If not yourself, think of us...

400
00:55:01,796 --> 00:55:04,691
think of Papa! Do you know
what you're doing?

401
00:55:04,765 --> 00:55:08,298
Does anyone care for me?
I don't want to live

402
00:55:08,469 --> 00:55:11,504
Sanya! You've gone crazy?
- Yes! I'm crazy!

403
00:55:11,505 --> 00:55:13,606
Leave her

404
00:55:13,607 --> 00:55:15,608
Let her be

405
00:55:15,609 --> 00:55:17,911
Sanya, what is the matter?

406
00:55:17,912 --> 00:55:22,309
You aren't my Papa!
- Sure, I'm not

407
00:55:22,349 --> 00:55:24,451
You aren't!
- No, I'm not

408
00:55:24,452 --> 00:55:28,815
Come here, and listen to me.
Over there... listen...

409
00:55:35,529 --> 00:55:40,757
I tried to make you see reason,
but you won't see reason

410
00:55:42,036 --> 00:55:45,671
It will be as you want

411
00:55:46,540 --> 00:55:49,231
You're going to marry the man you want

412
00:55:49,643 --> 00:55:54,746
Sukant.
- Yes Sukant. But remember one thing

413
00:55:55,015 --> 00:55:59,344
The future of this marriage
is solely your responsibility

414
00:56:00,121 --> 00:56:02,618
I'll manage

415
00:56:03,657 --> 00:56:07,292
Avantika, Isha, let's
prepare for the wedding

416
00:56:34,622 --> 00:56:36,556
Delhi-folks...

417
00:56:36,557 --> 00:56:38,024
folks with a heart...

418
00:56:38,025 --> 00:56:40,249
Salaams from the heart

419
00:56:42,630 --> 00:56:46,561
So finally, today,
Sanya and Sukant's love triumphs

420
00:56:48,636 --> 00:56:52,772
What a thing love is!

421
00:56:52,973 --> 00:56:57,977
At some point of time or the other,
somewhere or the other...

422
00:56:57,978 --> 00:57:00,669
everyone without exception
has fallen in love

423
00:57:00,748 --> 00:57:04,713
Some have been consummated,
some loves have gone unrequited

424
00:57:05,085 --> 00:57:08,276
But love lives on

425
00:57:10,591 --> 00:57:16,596
In the name of love, we the youngsters,
have decided that tonight's song...

426
00:57:16,597 --> 00:57:20,630
isn't mine. I'm not singing

427
00:57:20,935 --> 00:57:23,296
Uncle Raj sings

428
00:57:27,508 --> 00:57:30,108
Amazed, Uncle Raj?

429
00:58:16,822 --> 00:58:22,016
"Some years ago friends,
there was talk..."

430
00:58:23,863 --> 00:58:28,829
"of me falling in love with someone"

431
00:58:30,736 --> 00:58:36,237
"We too had a first meeting"

432
00:58:38,044 --> 00:58:42,840
"I too fell in love with someone"

433
00:59:13,412 --> 00:59:15,714
"In the rains, on the streets..."

434
00:59:15,715 --> 00:59:22,877
"holding an umbrella, I was going,
she was coming... like this"

435
00:59:39,138 --> 00:59:43,908
"We crashed into each other,
we were embarrassed"

436
00:59:43,909 --> 00:59:50,749
"We said, please forgive me,
what we meant was..."

437
00:59:50,750 --> 00:59:55,784
"Give me your heart"

438
01:00:07,566 --> 01:00:12,396
"Romance happened
...by chance"

439
01:00:19,111 --> 01:00:23,848
"We became lovers, but we had litte time"

440
01:00:23,849 --> 01:00:28,815
"In a hurry, I give my heart,
I call the priest..."

441
01:00:28,854 --> 01:00:33,291
"I sit on a horse, I become bridegroom"

442
01:00:33,292 --> 01:00:35,983
"I become the bridegroom"

443
01:00:42,802 --> 01:00:46,437
"So beautiful ..."

444
01:00:52,345 --> 01:00:56,948
"So beautiful was the night when we wed"

445
01:00:56,949 --> 01:01:01,686
"Oh yes, I too fell in love with someone"

446
01:01:01,687 --> 01:01:06,358
"Some years ago friends,
there was talk..."

447
01:01:06,359 --> 01:01:11,189
"of me falling in love with someone"

448
01:01:20,573 --> 01:01:24,401
"Had she been here tonight..."

449
01:01:25,211 --> 01:01:28,141
"she would've played the dholak"

450
01:01:34,720 --> 01:01:39,220
"She would've been happy"

451
01:01:39,225 --> 01:01:43,417
"She would've kissed her girl"

452
01:01:44,230 --> 01:01:48,764
"She would've blessed you,
she'd ward off the evil eye"

453
01:01:51,303 --> 01:01:54,369
"She would've sung a song of love"

454
01:01:55,841 --> 01:01:59,374
"Oh wouldn't she have
have made me burn..."

455
01:02:00,613 --> 01:02:03,781
"in fires of jealousy"

456
01:02:05,351 --> 01:02:10,112
"But everything is changed,
everything's changed"

457
01:02:17,096 --> 01:02:21,699
"There was a day when I wept like rain"

458
01:02:21,700 --> 01:02:26,666
"Oh yes, I too fell in love with someone"

459
01:02:26,705 --> 01:02:31,009
"Some years ago friends,
there was talk..."

460
01:02:31,010 --> 01:02:35,942
"of me falling in love with someone"

461
01:02:45,758 --> 01:02:47,792
"Loves..."

462
01:02:47,793 --> 01:02:50,195
"griefs..."

463
01:02:50,196 --> 01:02:51,963
"tales..."

464
01:02:51,964 --> 01:02:54,655
"words"

465
01:03:03,809 --> 01:03:09,173
"Words are forgotten"

466
01:03:09,248 --> 01:03:13,645
"Memories return"

467
01:03:28,167 --> 01:03:30,391
"Memories..."

468
01:03:32,705 --> 01:03:39,711
"Memories cherished,
of beloved ones..."

469
01:03:39,712 --> 01:03:46,408
"return once they're gone"

470
01:03:57,663 --> 01:04:01,733
Papa! What are you doing?
How's Isha?

471
01:04:01,734 --> 01:04:04,035
Isha is away in Malaysia, for a cycle race

472
01:04:04,036 --> 01:04:08,439
You know, in London,
Uncle Ranbir Rai has been named...

473
01:04:08,440 --> 01:04:11,802
best businessman of the year.
It was on tvv

474
01:04:26,959 --> 01:04:30,253
Congratulations Mr Rai

475
01:04:31,630 --> 01:04:33,797
Congratulations Mrs Rai

476
01:04:36,702 --> 01:04:38,703
Malhotra, you're wonderful!
- How come?

477
01:04:38,704 --> 01:04:41,606
No sooner than I get the award,
you've thrown a party for me

478
01:04:41,607 --> 01:04:45,299
I have given you my hand
in friendship, never to let go

479
01:04:45,711 --> 01:04:48,345
You haven't sampled my friendship yet

480
01:04:50,816 --> 01:04:54,919
Raj keeps praising you to the skies.
- Raj is like a son

481
01:04:54,920 --> 01:04:57,655
I've known him since he was a baby.
- His daughter's wedding...

482
01:04:57,656 --> 01:05:01,092
we couldn't attend.
- You know, business matters...

483
01:05:01,093 --> 01:05:05,563
Monishka hasn't come?
- There she is, with your son

484
01:05:05,564 --> 01:05:07,966
American Indians and British Indians

485
01:05:07,967 --> 01:05:12,364
I keep visiting your cdguru.com

486
01:05:13,572 --> 01:05:18,676
There are more dotcoms.
Dosti.com, mohobbat.com, shaadi.com

487
01:05:18,677 --> 01:05:25,016
Right from friendship to love?
- And from love to marriages

488
01:05:25,017 --> 01:05:28,242
Marriages? How boring

489
01:05:33,192 --> 01:05:35,883
What does the pair look like?

490
01:05:37,429 --> 01:05:42,700
What programme for tomorrow evening?
- Tomorrow, I'm flying to Malaysia

491
01:05:42,701 --> 01:05:45,837
To cover the Asian Cycle Race.
- Cycle race?

492
01:05:45,838 --> 01:05:48,335
Yes, big race

493
01:06:09,662 --> 01:06:13,263
Isha is here too?
- I know

494
01:06:13,666 --> 01:06:18,359
But she doesn't know I'm here.
- But where's she?

495
01:06:18,570 --> 01:06:22,607
Son, you can't even see her.
Only I can see her

496
01:06:22,608 --> 01:06:24,709
Today's the first day
of the Asian Cycle Race

497
01:06:24,710 --> 01:06:29,681
Companies from 21 countries
have sent their best racers here

498
01:06:29,682 --> 01:06:32,350
Sunday, the biggest day
of this event will see...

499
01:06:32,351 --> 01:06:39,023
Preeti Sawhney of Dubai participating.
She is an Indian, and she has won...

500
01:06:39,024 --> 01:06:41,959
this race the last two times,
consecutively. This year too...

501
01:06:41,960 --> 01:06:44,560
there seems to be no competition
for her in sight

502
01:06:56,642 --> 01:07:00,140
Let's introduce you
to Isha Puri from London

503
01:07:00,212 --> 01:07:03,346
Where are you from?
- England

504
01:07:03,415 --> 01:07:05,817
Where from, originally?
- India

505
01:07:05,818 --> 01:07:07,819
Your name?
- Isha

506
01:07:07,820 --> 01:07:11,422
Your goal?
- Always number one

507
01:07:11,423 --> 01:07:13,681
You have a boyfriend?

508
01:07:13,992 --> 01:07:16,494
You don't believe in love?

509
01:07:16,495 --> 01:07:20,631
Not at all.
- What about affairs?

510
01:07:20,733 --> 01:07:23,958
Are you crazy?
- No

511
01:07:28,107 --> 01:07:31,708
Trying to make a fool out of me?
- And make a fool out of a fool?

512
01:07:32,678 --> 01:07:36,836
A childhood love...

513
01:07:38,817 --> 01:07:42,954
Never expected you'd crop up here.
- Just dropped by

514
01:07:42,955 --> 01:07:47,386
I knew you'd be here.
- Papa must've told you

515
01:07:47,693 --> 01:07:53,729
Also true. But you had to be here,
you're the cycle-event star

516
01:07:53,732 --> 01:07:57,060
I'm just a small-time
reporter here

517
01:07:57,636 --> 01:08:03,774
Look Ronit, don't mind.
I'd like to be independent here

518
01:08:03,909 --> 01:08:07,203
Far from the world, far from home.
- And far from me...?

519
01:08:07,713 --> 01:08:10,540
Maybe, too.
- Yes...?

520
01:08:10,716 --> 01:08:13,718
So in this event, you and I...

521
01:08:13,719 --> 01:08:15,787
strangers

522
01:08:15,788 --> 01:08:18,820
Yes, strangers

523
01:08:24,897 --> 01:08:28,430
Come on, only an hour to go for the heats

524
01:08:44,750 --> 01:08:46,684
Wait, wait, wait...

525
01:08:46,685 --> 01:08:48,686
Soft fingers...

526
01:08:48,687 --> 01:08:50,688
warm hands...

527
01:08:50,689 --> 01:08:54,586
and solid wrists.
You can be the only one

528
01:09:04,703 --> 01:09:06,938
I could stop a race to hear that compliment

529
01:09:06,939 --> 01:09:10,374
If you've said I'm best,
I'll become the best

530
01:09:10,375 --> 01:09:12,667
Now the race starts!

531
01:09:13,312 --> 01:09:17,413
Preeti, I like your nature.
- I like everything about you

532
01:09:19,051 --> 01:09:21,412
Pass-Pass. Want some?

533
01:09:27,793 --> 01:09:33,130
Look, plying him with Pass-Pass
to get close

534
01:09:33,131 --> 01:09:35,822
My belt is a bit too tight

535
01:09:38,904 --> 01:09:41,834
Look! Undoing her belt

536
01:09:47,312 --> 01:09:50,003
How will I win tomorrow's race?

537
01:10:11,837 --> 01:10:13,704
What happened?

538
01:10:13,705 --> 01:10:19,710
Papa! I don't want to live in
Sukant's house! It's Hell, not home

539
01:10:19,711 --> 01:10:25,716
His mother is so abusive!
His father keeps cursing me

540
01:10:25,717 --> 01:10:31,389
Sukant takes sides with his mother!
They're scum!

541
01:10:31,390 --> 01:10:35,423
I've thought it over,
I want a divorce, that's all

542
01:10:38,997 --> 01:10:41,688
You were right, Papa

543
01:10:42,734 --> 01:10:47,894
All this about being in love is
a lot of nonsense. Isha was right

544
01:10:50,676 --> 01:10:56,712
Relax, you're home, aren't you?
Come on, my child

545
01:11:11,697 --> 01:11:14,699
There goes Preeti Sawhney, full steam

546
01:11:14,700 --> 01:11:18,392
All eyes, all bets on Preeti Sawhney

547
01:11:41,226 --> 01:11:44,417
Preeti Sawhney, going great guns

548
01:11:45,263 --> 01:11:49,023
Tailing her, Isha Puri, trying her best

549
01:12:28,173 --> 01:12:32,673
Isha Puri of Hero Cycles
wins the Asian Championships

550
01:12:43,055 --> 01:12:47,691
It's the fire in the heart
that takes you to victory

551
01:12:50,062 --> 01:12:53,754
That dig was for you.
- She's the heroine

552
01:12:55,667 --> 01:12:58,358
A few words for our dotcom?

553
01:13:00,105 --> 01:13:03,674
Yes, I'm not saying thank-you
to anyone. It's my grit...

554
01:13:03,675 --> 01:13:08,311
my determination that has led me
to my victory. And God's grace

555
01:13:08,680 --> 01:13:11,371
No one takes any credit

556
01:13:11,750 --> 01:13:18,389
And these tvv websites are full of
half-truths. Please don't trust them

557
01:13:21,393 --> 01:13:23,560
Congratulations

558
01:13:23,695 --> 01:13:29,298
But wimers aren't so vainglorious.
- Then losers are?

559
01:13:32,804 --> 01:13:35,836
You go to your Ms Pass-Pass

560
01:13:36,708 --> 01:13:40,400
I see... you are...

561
01:13:41,646 --> 01:13:45,679
That was just a joke...
- Look Mr Stranger...

562
01:13:45,717 --> 01:13:49,553
I'd like to say something straight.
Tomorrow friends and I...

563
01:13:49,554 --> 01:13:53,815
are visiting Tuba Island.
No need to pursue me

564
01:13:55,427 --> 01:13:59,688
Ronit, Tuba Island is full
of dangerous beasts

565
01:14:00,665 --> 01:14:02,855
Stop her

566
01:14:45,010 --> 01:14:47,974
Wait! We're leaving Isha behind

567
01:14:58,657 --> 01:15:02,349
Isha is on Tuba Island! In trouble!
- Her friends have deserted her...

568
01:15:58,650 --> 01:16:02,386
Any news of Isha?
- Oh yes, lots of news

569
01:16:02,387 --> 01:16:04,655
Just because of your heroine,
our hero is in trouble

570
01:16:04,656 --> 01:16:07,347
Even cellphones aren't working here

571
01:17:23,234 --> 01:17:27,370
Last night, the doctors
nearly gave up on Ronit

572
01:17:27,806 --> 01:17:32,374
I got to see him.
- You're supposed to rest

573
01:17:33,478 --> 01:17:39,377
Maybe you don't appreciate it,
but what he did was unimaginable

574
01:17:42,220 --> 01:17:46,117
How's Ronit?
- Out of danger

575
01:18:09,347 --> 01:18:15,417
Remember I told you,
there'll be tears in your eyes?

576
01:18:16,721 --> 01:18:19,082
What's this?

577
01:18:21,292 --> 01:18:23,755
Let go

578
01:18:25,730 --> 01:18:28,091
Let go of my hand

579
01:19:05,770 --> 01:19:12,409
I told Sanya that when my mother
loses her temper, she just flares up

580
01:19:12,710 --> 01:19:16,402
And Sanya talks back at her. Straight.
- Whatever I said is justified

581
01:19:20,485 --> 01:19:26,457
I don't want to stay in that house.
- And I'm in a fix. For no reason

582
01:19:26,458 --> 01:19:33,427
Sukant is here for Sanya.
- I'll find a house once I have a job

583
01:19:33,865 --> 01:19:37,557
I can't live with his mother. Period

584
01:19:38,937 --> 01:19:41,298
Things don't work out this way, Sanya

585
01:19:47,278 --> 01:19:53,041
Look son, I understand everything.
Just wait a while

586
01:19:54,352 --> 01:19:59,045
You decided on this marriage
between yourselves

587
01:20:00,058 --> 01:20:02,726
You must find the solutions for yourselves

588
01:20:09,701 --> 01:20:12,369
When hearts meet...

589
01:20:12,370 --> 01:20:15,172
flowers blossom

590
01:20:15,173 --> 01:20:18,175
When hearts meet, flowers blossom

591
01:20:18,176 --> 01:20:21,345
When flowers blossom, hearts meet

592
01:20:21,346 --> 01:20:23,881
Hearts meet...

593
01:20:23,882 --> 01:20:27,073
flowers blossom

594
01:21:11,129 --> 01:21:17,199
"Oh, love's fires"

595
01:21:19,604 --> 01:21:25,108
"When the flames of passion are lit,
storms rage in the seas of the heart"

596
01:21:25,109 --> 01:21:28,972
"The earth is shaken, skies rent asunder"

597
01:21:33,618 --> 01:21:39,056
"Love's ruination too,
love is a prayer too"

598
01:21:39,057 --> 01:21:42,225
"Some pray for love, some curse"

599
01:21:47,198 --> 01:21:50,100
"When hearts meet..."

600
01:21:50,101 --> 01:21:53,361
"flowers blossom"

601
01:22:03,915 --> 01:22:07,017
"When hearts meet, flowers blossom"

602
01:22:07,018 --> 01:22:10,380
"When flowers blossom, then hearts meet"

603
01:22:15,560 --> 01:22:20,390
"Oh, love's fires"

604
01:22:56,834 --> 01:22:59,670
"Ever since you..."

605
01:22:59,671 --> 01:23:02,439
"came into my heart"

606
01:23:02,440 --> 01:23:05,242
"Life has been..."

607
01:23:05,243 --> 01:23:08,178
"so difficult"

608
01:23:08,179 --> 01:23:13,684
"Even amidst revellers
I am lonely..."

609
01:23:13,685 --> 01:23:16,717
"in loneliness I revel"

610
01:23:22,527 --> 01:23:27,931
"This is a world of our love,
come embrace me"

611
01:23:27,932 --> 01:23:31,567
"Put an end to this suffering"

612
01:23:46,851 --> 01:23:49,486
"Whatever you wish..."

613
01:23:49,487 --> 01:23:52,322
"let us do, oh let's do"

614
01:23:52,323 --> 01:23:54,825
"Right here, right now..."

615
01:23:54,826 --> 01:23:57,894
"oh let me die"

616
01:23:57,895 --> 01:24:00,664
"Our hearts..."

617
01:24:00,665 --> 01:24:03,266
"oh dear sweet hearts..."

618
01:24:03,267 --> 01:24:06,103
"with memories..."

619
01:24:06,104 --> 01:24:09,139
"let us fill"

620
01:24:09,140 --> 01:24:12,365
"Let hearts meet"

621
01:24:17,782 --> 01:24:23,647
"Let hearts meet, let flowers blossom"

622
01:25:30,588 --> 01:25:33,722
"Some pray for love, some curse"

623
01:25:35,927 --> 01:25:39,391
"Some curse, some pray"

624
01:25:43,701 --> 01:25:47,666
Lies! All lies

625
01:25:48,573 --> 01:25:55,508
Lies, everything! Friendship...
this love, romance, all lies

626
01:25:55,646 --> 01:26:00,077
All deceptions! What a mistake I made,
conceding! You lied to me

627
01:26:00,084 --> 01:26:02,775
A father can never be
his daughter's friend...

628
01:26:03,654 --> 01:26:05,946
he can never be

629
01:26:06,557 --> 01:26:09,248
How I wish I had never given my consent

630
01:26:37,989 --> 01:26:43,752
Everyone is in Udaipur, and here you
are, still. It's so late. Now go on

631
01:26:44,395 --> 01:26:48,064
Your friend's silver jubilee
wedding amiversary! Isha and Ronit...

632
01:26:48,065 --> 01:26:50,200
are hosting a grand show, and you...?
- But...

633
01:26:50,201 --> 01:26:56,339
No buts. I know you're worried
about Sanya. I'll take care of her

634
01:26:56,841 --> 01:27:01,341
Please, don't tell anyone
about Sanya, not even Isha

635
01:27:01,545 --> 01:27:06,944
Why spoil the party? VIPs from
all over the world are there

636
01:27:16,645 --> 01:27:21,639
Rajasthan, Udaipur is home for me.
What I don't understand is...

637
01:27:22,651 --> 01:27:27,452
how you chose the Maharajah's palace
for the party from faraway London?

638
01:27:29,457 --> 01:27:34,520
It's my son Ronit's idea.
Preparations for the party...

639
01:27:34,663 --> 01:27:38,064
the music, the celebrations are all
being organised by Ronit and Isha

640
01:27:38,266 --> 01:27:43,898
But you haven't introduced Ronit to us.
- Oh yes, where's Ronit? Call him

641
01:27:48,376 --> 01:27:51,368
Ronit, don't force me to dance
at the party. I don't know dancing

642
01:27:51,680 --> 01:27:55,480
Who else is going to dance with me?
- Latch on to some butterfly

643
01:27:55,684 --> 01:28:02,089
Lots of them flying about. You love
flattering them, don't you? Do that

644
01:28:06,761 --> 01:28:09,958
What are you staring at?
- Your eyes

645
01:28:15,303 --> 01:28:17,100
Just keep sitting

646
01:28:18,840 --> 01:28:20,831
Ever since we met, we've been friends

647
01:28:22,177 --> 01:28:25,044
Today we're lovers.

648
01:28:27,649 --> 01:28:30,049
Tomorrow...
- Tomorrow...?

649
01:28:31,019 --> 01:28:36,116
Just you and I, together...
- Just us?

650
01:28:36,925 --> 01:28:40,725
Just us

651
01:28:44,733 --> 01:28:47,327
Where are you my friend?
Your friend is here

652
01:28:47,669 --> 01:28:49,068
Go to Papa

653
01:28:49,671 --> 01:28:51,468
Okay, I'm off

654
01:28:53,675 --> 01:28:55,666
You'll talk to Papa, won't you?

655
01:28:56,678 --> 01:28:59,010
About what?
- Don't you know?

656
01:28:59,447 --> 01:29:03,042
Oh yes! I'll tell him,
get Isha married off fast

657
01:29:03,585 --> 01:29:05,678
If she falls in love with someone,
it could be a problem, no?

658
01:29:06,087 --> 01:29:07,349
Got you
