00:26:06,565 --> 00:26:09,227
- Hello, Laurey.
- What you doing with that peddler-man?

296
00:26:09,334 --> 00:26:12,360
- Will Parker gets back today.
- Will Parker. Oh, foot.

297
00:26:12,470 --> 00:26:16,566
- I didn't count on today being Saturday.
- I can see that.

298
00:26:16,675 --> 00:26:19,235
My, oh, my, Miss Laurey!
"Jippity" crickets.

299
00:26:19,344 --> 00:26:22,472
Last time I come through here,
you was teeny like a shrimp with freckles.

300
00:26:22,581 --> 00:26:25,641
Now look on you.

301
00:26:25,750 --> 00:26:28,810
Quit a-bitin' me! If you ain't had
no breakfast, go eat yourself a green apple.

302
00:26:28,920 --> 00:26:30,820
Are you coming in or going out?

303
00:26:30,922 --> 00:26:33,652
Standing still while you're here.
Go up to the house and wait.

304
00:26:33,758 --> 00:26:36,522
It'll be no trouble
at all to wait right here.

305
00:26:36,628 --> 00:26:39,028
So much water.

306
00:26:39,130 --> 00:26:41,223
Why don't we all
take a swim together?

307
00:26:41,333 --> 00:26:44,359
In Persia, where I come from,
bathing is a social event.

308
00:26:44,469 --> 00:26:47,836
- Well, this ain't Persia!
- I can already see you two young ladies...

309
00:26:47,939 --> 00:26:50,874
in those beautiful
Persian bathing suits.

310
00:26:50,976 --> 00:26:53,638
What do they wear
when they bathe socially in Persia?

311
00:26:53,745 --> 00:26:56,373
- Nothing.
- Nothing. Ooh!

312
00:26:58,650 --> 00:27:01,278
The peddler-man's gonna drive me
to the box social.

313
00:27:01,386 --> 00:27:03,286
I got up sort of a tasty lunch.

314
00:27:03,388 --> 00:27:05,288
But you're promised
to Will Parker, ain't ya?

315
00:27:05,390 --> 00:27:08,484
Oh, ain't what you might say, promised.
I just told him maybe.

316
00:27:08,593 --> 00:27:10,527
Don't you like Will no more?

317
00:27:10,629 --> 00:27:14,565
Of course I do.
There won't never be nobody like Will.

318
00:27:14,666 --> 00:27:16,896
Then what about this peddler-man?

319
00:27:17,002 --> 00:27:19,562
Oh, there won't never be
nobody like him neither.

320
00:27:19,671 --> 00:27:23,607
Well, you gotta make up your mind.
Which one do you like the best?

321
00:27:23,708 --> 00:27:27,371
- Well, whatever one I'm with.
- Well, you are a silly.

322
00:27:27,479 --> 00:27:32,007
Well, now, Laurey, you know that nobody
paid me no mind up till this year...

323
00:27:32,117 --> 00:27:34,813
on account I was scrawny
and flat as a beanpole.

324
00:27:34,919 --> 00:27:36,944
But then I kinda
rounded up a little...

325
00:27:37,055 --> 00:27:39,990
- and now the boys act different to me.
- What's wrong with that?

326
00:27:40,091 --> 00:27:42,491
Nothing's wrong.
I like it!

327
00:27:42,594 --> 00:27:44,653
I like it so much
when a fella talks pretty to me...

328
00:27:44,763 --> 00:27:47,357
I get all shaky
from horn to hoof.

329
00:27:47,465 --> 00:27:49,729
- Don't you?
- Can't think what you're talking about.

330
00:27:49,834 --> 00:27:53,565
Don't you feel kinda sorry for a fella
when he looks like he wants to kiss ya?

331
00:27:53,672 --> 00:27:58,234
Well, you can't just go around kissing every man
that asks ya. Didn't anyone tell you that?

332
00:27:58,343 --> 00:28:00,706
Yeah, they told me.

333
00:28:00,741 --> 00:28:03,070
Yeah, they told me.

334
00:28:03,181 --> 00:28:06,708

00:31:00,525 --> 00:31:02,789
It's like I told you, Laurey,
I get sorry for 'em.

383
00:31:02,894 --> 00:31:04,794
And now that old Will
has to come home.

384
00:31:04,896 --> 00:31:08,457
First thing you know, he'll start talking
pretty to me and changing my mind back.

385
00:31:08,566 --> 00:31:11,797
- But Will wants to marry you.
- So does Ali Hakim.

386
00:31:11,903 --> 00:31:14,929
- Did he ask you about marryin'?
- Not directly.

387
00:31:15,039 --> 00:31:16,939
But how I know this,
he said this morning...

388
00:31:17,041 --> 00:31:19,976
that he wanted for me to ride with him
to the end of the world.

389
00:31:20,078 --> 00:31:24,481
Well, if we drove only as far as "Catoosy,"
he couldn't bring me home till morning...

390
00:31:24,582 --> 00:31:26,516
and that means
a wedding, don't it?

391
00:31:26,618 --> 00:31:28,711
Not to a peddler, it don't.

<i>to show your face again, old peddler-man.</i>

395
00:31:47,372 --> 00:31:50,637
Remember what you told me? You said
that eggbeater you sold me would beat up eggs...

396
00:31:50,742 --> 00:31:53,768
wring out dishrags, turn the ice cream freezer
and I don't know what all.

397
00:31:53,878 --> 00:31:57,439
- Now, Aunt Eller, just listen.
- Don't you Aunt Eller me, you little wart. I'm mad.

398
00:31:57,548 --> 00:32:01,314
If the eggbeater don't work,
I give you something just as good. A present.

399
00:32:01,419 --> 00:32:03,387
I wouldn't have it.

400
00:32:03,488 --> 00:32:07,891
- What is it?
- Real silk. Made in Persia.

401
00:32:07,992 --> 00:32:10,859
What would I do with
an old Persian garter?

402
00:32:10,962 --> 00:32:13,624
It looks pretty.
Now gimme the other one.

403

Which one? Oh, you want to buy
this one to match that one?

What do you mean
do I wanna buy it?

00:32:19,470 --> 00:32:22,371
I can let you have it for 50 cents.

406
00:32:22,473 --> 00:32:25,135
Do you want me to get that eggbeater
and ram it down your windpipe?

407
00:32:25,243 --> 00:32:27,143
- Gimme that.
- Howdy, Aunt Eller.

408
00:32:27,245 --> 00:32:29,338
- Hi, yourself.

some pretty "doodaddles."

Lace around the bottom
and there are bows running in and out.

411
00:32:36,287 --> 00:32:39,688
Well, I never wear 'em myself,
but I sure do like to look at 'em.

412
00:32:39,791 --> 00:32:44,353
- How about these?
- Yeah, they's all right if you ain't goin' no place.

413

Don't nobody want to buy something?

How about you, Miss Laurey?
You must be wanting something...

00:32:54,038 --> 00:32:56,836
Me? Of course
I want something.

00:32:56,941 --> 00:33:00,934
I want a buckle made out of
shiny silver to fasten onto my shoes.

418
00:33:01,045 --> 00:33:05,948
I want a dress with lace.
I want perfume. I want to be purty.

419
00:33:06,050 --> 00:33:09,542
- I wanna smell like a honeysuckle vine.
- Give her a cake of soap.

420
00:33:09,654 --> 00:33:12,350
I want things
I can't tell you about.

421
00:33:12,457 --> 00:33:15,085
Not only things to look at
and hold in your hand...

422
00:33:15,193 --> 00:33:17,491
but things
to happen to you...

423
00:33:17,595 --> 00:33:23,033
things so nice that if they ever did
happen to you, your heart would quit beating.

I got a-just the thing.

The elixir of Egypt.

426

A secret formula,
belong to pharaoh's daughter.

427

- Smellin' salts.
- But a special kind of smelling salts.

Here, read what it says
on the label.

429
00:33:37,849 --> 00:33:40,613
You take a deep breath,
and you see everything clear.

430
00:33:40,718 --> 00:33:44,745
That's what pharaoh's daughter used to do
when she had to decide what dress to wear...

431
00:33:44,856 --> 00:33:47,120
or which prince
she ought to marry.

432
00:33:47,225 --> 00:33:49,125
She would take a whiff of this.

433
00:33:49,227 --> 00:33:51,991
- I'll take a bottle of that, Mr. Peddler.
- Oh, precious stuff.

434
00:33:52,096 --> 00:33:54,064
- How much?
- Two bits.

435
00:33:54,165 --> 00:33:57,760
- Throwin' away your money.
- Helps you decide what to do.

436
00:33:57,869 --> 00:33:59,769
Put your trappings away
and come inside.

437

Come along, Laurey. Maybe we can
find him something to eat and drink.

438
00:34:06,511 --> 00:34:10,311
Ali, Laurey and me
been having an argument.

439
00:34:10,415 --> 00:34:13,043
- About what, baby?
- About what you meant...

440
00:34:13,151 --> 00:34:16,245
when you said that about drivin' with me
to the end of the world.

your heart's busted in two.

592

- Are you positive you got to marry Will?
- Sure as shootin'!

593
00:47:17,734 --> 00:47:20,259
- There's no chance for you to change your mind?
- No chance.

594

- All right then. My heart is busted in two.

- Rabbits.

That true what I hear
about Will Parker getting $50?

597
00:47:32,816 --> 00:47:35,546
That's right, Pa.
He wants to hold you to your promise.

598

Too bad. Still in all,
I can't go back on my word.

599

Listen to me, Annie I advise you
to get that money before he loses it all.

600

Put it in your stocking
or inside your corset...

601

where he can't get at it-
Or can he?

602
00:47:47,664 --> 00:47:50,758
But, Pa, he ain't exactly kept it.
He spent it all on presents.

603
00:47:50,868 --> 00:47:52,768
See, what did I tell ya?
Well, now he can't have you.

604

- Oh, Pa, that's Ali Hakim.

606

Well, shut your face,
or I'll fill your behind so full of buckshot...

you'll be walking around like a duck
the rest of your life.

Ali, if I don't
have to marry Will...

609

maybe your heart don't have to be busted
in two like you said.

610

- Are you trying to make
my daughter out to be a liar?

No, I'm only trying to make clear to you
what a liar I am, if she is telling the truth.

613

I'm no good.
I'm a peddler!

Uh, you sure for certain
you can bear to let me go?

Aw, Ali, ain't it wonderful, Pa making up
our minds for us? And he won't change neither.

00:56:33,957 --> 00:56:36,289
I just thought I'd pay a call.

<i>- You got a gun, I see.</i>
- That's right.

00:56:40,797 --> 00:56:43,561
It's a Colt.45.

746
00:56:43,666 --> 00:56:45,566
Oh.

747
00:56:48,471 --> 00:56:50,371
Say, now.

748
00:56:50,473 --> 00:56:54,204
That there pink picture-
That's a naked woman, ain't it?

749
00:56:54,310 --> 00:56:57,143
Plumb stark naked as a jaybird.

750
00:56:57,247 --> 00:56:59,374
Shucks, that ain't a thing
to what I could show you.

751
00:57:02,419 --> 00:57:05,650
Well, that's
a good-lookin' rope.

752
00:57:05,755 --> 00:57:07,723

[Grunts]

754
00:57:12,095 --> 00:57:14,859
That's a good, strong hook
you got there, Jud.

755
00:57:18,435 --> 00:57:21,734
You know what?
You could hang yourself on that.

756
00:57:21,838 --> 00:57:24,602
- I could what?
<i>- You could hang yourself.</i>

757
00:57:26,109 --> 00:57:29,670
Yes, sir.
Easy as rollin' off a log.

758
00:57:29,779 --> 00:57:32,270
Why, in five minutes
or less, with good luck...

759

<i>- you could be dead as a doornail.</i>
- What do you mean by that?

760
00:57:35,585 --> 00:57:39,521
Oh, then folks would
come to your funeral.

761
00:57:39,622 --> 00:57:41,681
- And they'd sing sad songs.
- [Scoffs]

762
00:57:41,791 --> 00:57:43,691
Why, they would.

763
00:57:43,793 --> 00:57:47,285
You never know how many people like you
till you're dead.

764
00:57:48,798 --> 00:57:50,698
You'd be laid out in a parlor.

765
00:57:50,800 --> 00:57:53,030
All decked out in your best suit.

766

Your hair combed down slick,
high starched collar.

Lots of pretty flowers
all around you.

768
00:57:59,476 --> 00:58:01,376
Would there be flowers,
you think?

769
00:58:01,478 --> 00:58:03,378

all around your coffin.

771
00:58:06,249 --> 00:58:09,810
Folks would gather round,
and men would bare their heads.

772
00:58:09,919 --> 00:58:11,978
Women would sniffle softly.

773
00:58:12,088 --> 00:58:13,988
Some probably even faint-

774
00:58:14,090 --> 00:58:16,320
ones that took a shine to you
whilst you was alive.

775
00:58:16,426 --> 00:58:18,656
Now, what women
ever took a shine to me?

776
00:58:18,761 --> 00:58:20,991
Why, lots of women.

777
00:58:21,097 --> 00:58:23,156
Only they never come right out
and tell you how they feel...

778
00:58:23,266 --> 00:58:25,826
unless you die first.

I guess maybe you're right.

780
00:58:28,438 --> 00:58:31,669
They'd sure sing loud,
though, when the singin' would start.

781
00:58:31,774 --> 00:58:33,891
Sing like their hearts would break.

782
00:58:33,926 --> 00:58:36,009
Sing like their hearts would break.

796
00:59:37,106 --> 00:59:39,666
And then the preacher'd
get up, and he'd say-

797
00:59:39,776 --> 00:59:43,678
Folks, we are gathered here to moan
and groan over our brother Jud Fry...

798
00:59:43,780 --> 00:59:47,341
who hung hisself up
by a rope in a smokehouse.

799
00:59:47,450 --> 00:59:50,351
And then there'd be weepin' and wailin'
from some of those women.

800
00:59:50,453 --> 00:59:52,353
And then he'd say-

801
00:59:52,455 --> 00:59:55,356
Jud was the most misunderstood man
in this territory.

802
00:59:55,458 --> 00:59:57,688
People used to think
he was a mean, ugly fella.

803
00:59:57,794 --> 01:00:01,195
And call him a dirty skunk
and ornery pig stealer.

804
01:00:01,297 --> 01:00:05,666
# But the folks
'at really knowed him #

805
01:00:05,768 --> 01:00:09,864
Knowed that beneath
them two dirty shirts he always wore-

806
01:00:09,973 --> 01:00:14,034
#There beat a heart
as big as all out-doors #

# He loved his fellow man #

810
01:00:22,251 --> 01:00:24,151
He loved the birds
of the forests...

811
01:00:24,253 --> 01:00:26,153
and the beasts of the field.

812
01:00:26,255 --> 01:00:28,348
He loved the mice
and the vermin in the barn.

813
01:00:28,458 --> 01:00:31,052
And he treated the rats
like equals.

814
01:00:31,160 --> 01:00:33,060
Which was right.

815
01:00:33,162 --> 01:00:35,392
He loved all the little children.

816
01:00:35,498 --> 01:00:38,399
He loved everything
and everybody in the world.
