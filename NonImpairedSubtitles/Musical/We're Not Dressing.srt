1
00:01:23,530 --> 00:01:26,624
We've sailed to every shore
from here to Singapore

2
00:01:26,700 --> 00:01:30,261
But we've never, never
never seen a mermaid

3
00:01:30,337 --> 00:01:33,306
We've sailed the Seven Seas
Seen a million different shes

4
00:01:33,373 --> 00:01:36,706
But we've never, never
never seen a mermaid

5
00:01:36,777 --> 00:01:40,076
It's a lie
It's a lie

6
00:01:40,147 --> 00:01:43,583
Ship ahoy, ship ahey
ship ahigh

7
00:01:43,650 --> 00:01:46,813
We dream while we're asleep
that we're 80 fathoms deep

8
00:01:46,887 --> 00:01:50,482
But we've never, never
never seen a mermaid

9
00:01:52,259 --> 00:01:56,059
A sailor can't be true
to any one gal

10
00:01:56,129 --> 00:02:00,031
He's a cheatin'
son of the sea

11
00:02:00,100 --> 00:02:03,763
A sailor can't be true
to any one gal

12
00:02:03,837 --> 00:02:07,534
A sailor man
must have variety

13
00:02:07,607 --> 00:02:11,475
[n every port you leave
behind a heartache inside

14
00:02:11,545 --> 00:02:15,345
And always give 'em somethin'
to remember you by

15
00:02:15,415 --> 00:02:18,942
But I'm a man that
could be true to one gal

16
00:02:19,019 --> 00:02:22,147
If she's
the right gal for me

17
00:02:22,222 --> 00:02:25,783
It's a lie
It's a lie

18
00:02:25,859 --> 00:02:29,124
Ship ahoy, ship ahey
ship ahigh

19
00:02:29,196 --> 00:02:32,597
We've sailed to Timbuktu
Valparaiso and Peru

20
00:02:32,666 --> 00:02:35,692
But we've never, never
never seen a mermaid

21
00:02:35,769 --> 00:02:40,206
I've been a sea dog
since I was in me prime.

22
00:02:40,273 --> 00:02:44,437
- A seafaring man since B.C.
- B.C.?

23
00:02:44,511 --> 00:02:48,675
Yeah, B.C. Before
''Come up and see me sometime.''

24
00:02:48,748 --> 00:02:52,377
It's a lie
It's a lie

25
00:02:52,452 --> 00:02:55,478
Ship ahoy, ship ahey
ship ahigh

26
00:02:55,555 --> 00:02:59,116
We dream while we're asleep
that we're 80 fathoms deep

27
00:02:59,192 --> 00:03:02,889
But we've never, never
- Come on, Doris! You're in the next hand.

28
00:03:02,963 --> 00:03:06,899
Oh, here's a cocktail we've
never tried. A Yellow Parrot.

29
00:03:06,967 --> 00:03:10,061
Ship ahoy, ship ahey
ship ahigh Who wants one?

30
00:03:10,136 --> 00:03:13,264
We dream while we're asleep that we're
80 fathoms deep Hmm. A Yellow Parrot.

31
00:03:13,340 --> 00:03:16,468
But we've never, never
never seen a mermaid

32
00:03:21,848 --> 00:03:24,578
A Yellow Parrot.
Let's see.

33
00:03:24,651 --> 00:03:27,984
Gin, orangejuice,
cointreau, cherries.

34
00:03:28,054 --> 00:03:30,022
Hmm. Gin.

35
00:03:33,960 --> 00:03:37,191
Well, I don't think I'll
trouble with the orange juice.

36
00:03:37,264 --> 00:03:41,667
There's very little to be
gained from orange juice.

37
00:03:47,407 --> 00:03:49,932
It says brandy here.

38
00:03:50,010 --> 00:03:52,069
This is confusing.

39
00:03:52,145 --> 00:03:54,306
Well... brandy.

40
00:04:08,161 --> 00:04:11,688
What on Earth are you cooking? Ha-ha!

41
00:04:32,786 --> 00:04:35,118
It's too weak.

42
00:04:39,359 --> 00:04:43,563
Aaah!

43
00:04:43,630 --> 00:04:45,791
Ohhhhhhh.

44
00:04:45,865 --> 00:04:49,164
Nights in Havana
are warm and delicious

45
00:04:49,235 --> 00:04:52,432
They make trusting hearts
a bit too ambitious

46
00:04:52,505 --> 00:04:55,406
The sway of the palms
makes a girl so pernicious

47
00:04:55,475 --> 00:04:58,842
A tra-la-la
la-la-la-la-la

48
00:05:00,413 --> 00:05:03,644
The men are all sheiks
and they use a new system

49
00:05:03,717 --> 00:05:06,845
So, girlies, be careful
and learn to resist 'em

50
00:05:06,920 --> 00:05:10,185
They'll fill you with bull
and after you've kissed 'em

51
00:05:10,256 --> 00:05:14,454
They'll leave you flat on the
spot Ah-ha-ha, but for what

52
00:05:14,527 --> 00:05:18,588
Ahh, for tra-la-la
la-la-la-la-la, ohh

53
00:05:18,665 --> 00:05:21,691
If some caballero
takes off his sombrero

54
00:05:21,768 --> 00:05:24,794
You better take care-o
watch out and beware-o

55
00:05:24,871 --> 00:05:29,706
For it's just
a new Spanish custom

56
00:05:31,211 --> 00:05:34,612
If some sweet bambino
says you are his queen-o

57
00:05:34,681 --> 00:05:37,809
Then in some casino
he fills you with vino

58
00:05:37,884 --> 00:05:42,412
Oh, it's just
a new Spanish custom

59
00:05:44,257 --> 00:05:47,522
If he starts acting
too haughty-o

60
00:05:47,594 --> 00:05:50,688
Ah,just kick him
right in the patio

61
00:05:50,764 --> 00:05:53,858
If he starts to pet-o
I warn you no let-o

62
00:05:53,933 --> 00:05:56,925
If he sings ''I love you''
he's singing falsetto

63
00:05:57,003 --> 00:06:03,408
For it's just
a new Spanish custom

64
00:06:57,163 --> 00:07:00,155
If you're so interested
in that sailor,

65
00:07:00,233 --> 00:07:03,896
why don't you have him up here
and take him apart? What sailor?

66
00:07:03,970 --> 00:07:06,837
Oh, not the one
you stare at, of course.

67
00:07:06,906 --> 00:07:09,431
I do not stare at him.
I've hardly noticed him.

68
00:07:09,509 --> 00:07:13,377
Then, uh, why have you been
picking on him the whole voyage?

69
00:07:13,446 --> 00:07:16,415
Come along, Doris. I've cut
for you, and we're partners.

70
00:07:16,483 --> 00:07:21,477
- Oh, Michael, would you mind getting me a highball?
- Oh, certainly.

71
00:07:23,723 --> 00:07:26,283
Isn't he gorgeous?

72
00:07:26,359 --> 00:07:29,920
In fact, they're both gorgeous. Yeah.

73
00:07:29,996 --> 00:07:33,989
I don't wonder you have so much
trouble choosing between them.

74
00:07:34,067 --> 00:07:37,525
What are you butting into
this for? Me butting in?

75
00:07:37,604 --> 00:07:40,539
Hmph! I like that. I
found her first, didn't I?

76
00:07:40,607 --> 00:07:44,600
Didn't she ask me to get her this drink?
You don't do as well with women as I do.

77
00:07:44,677 --> 00:07:48,340
You've always got your cut, haven't
you? I proposed to her first.

78
00:07:48,414 --> 00:07:51,383
You're making a big mistake. Lay off.

79
00:07:51,451 --> 00:07:54,511
We three could be
very happy together.

80
00:07:56,556 --> 00:08:00,788
I wish you'd hurry up and take.
I'm simply dithering with envy.

81
00:08:00,860 --> 00:08:04,956
But why, darling? Because I'm gonna
take the one that's left, that's why.

82
00:08:05,031 --> 00:08:08,057
You are? Are you sure
you can afford it?

83
00:08:08,134 --> 00:08:11,035
I do hope I haven't
made it too strong.

84
00:08:11,104 --> 00:08:14,005
Why, Michael,
how can you say that?

85
00:08:14,073 --> 00:08:17,338
Whatever touches
those lips turns to honey.

86
00:08:17,410 --> 00:08:20,709
Aren't they divine?
They're positively sinful.

87
00:08:20,780 --> 00:08:24,944
Sinful is right. They're
positively a crime against nature.

88
00:08:33,259 --> 00:08:36,717
Here's your baby, nursemaid.
She's cryin' for ya.

89
00:08:36,796 --> 00:08:38,991
Oh, hello, Droopy.

90
00:08:39,065 --> 00:08:42,432
She probably wants her
whiskers combed. Sing to her.

91
00:08:42,502 --> 00:08:43,901
Come on, Steve.
Sing something.

92
00:08:43,970 --> 00:08:47,167
Oh, no, not me. You know
how funny she is about music.

93
00:08:47,240 --> 00:08:50,175
Oh, come on! That's all
right. I'll hold her for ya.

94
00:08:50,243 --> 00:08:52,871
Okay.

95
00:09:01,187 --> 00:09:04,281
I'll sing about
the birds and bees

96
00:09:04,357 --> 00:09:06,552
The pretty flowers
and the trees

97
00:09:06,626 --> 00:09:09,561
The moon, the sun
the summery breeze

98
00:09:09,629 --> 00:09:15,932
Hooray
I'll even go to town

99
00:09:16,002 --> 00:09:19,096
With ''London Bridge
Is Falling Down''

100
00:09:19,172 --> 00:09:22,664
But I positively
refuse to sing

101
00:09:22,742 --> 00:09:26,303
Don't know why

102
00:09:26,379 --> 00:09:29,405
There's no sun
up in the sky

103
00:09:29,482 --> 00:09:32,007
Stormy weather

104
00:09:32,085 --> 00:09:36,078
Since my gal and I
ain't together

105
00:09:36,155 --> 00:09:39,989
['ll sing about
the night we met

106
00:09:40,059 --> 00:09:42,892
And about to remember
or forget

107
00:09:42,962 --> 00:09:46,295
The grass is green
The dew is wet and say

108
00:09:46,366 --> 00:09:50,393
I'll yodel

109
00:09:50,470 --> 00:09:52,961
Night and day

110
00:09:53,039 --> 00:09:59,239
''On the Road to Mandalay''

111
00:09:59,312 --> 00:10:03,510
But I positively
refuse to sing

112
00:10:03,583 --> 00:10:06,313
Who's Afraid of
the Big Bad Wolf-a

113
00:10:06,386 --> 00:10:12,723
''When Annie Doesn't
Live Here Anymore''

114
00:10:12,792 --> 00:10:16,091
I'll take
a heartbreak

115
00:10:17,830 --> 00:10:22,164
I'll even end my song with
a ''hey-hey'' or a ''Yeah, man''

116
00:10:22,235 --> 00:10:25,830
I'll sing about
the cabin door

117
00:10:25,905 --> 00:10:28,703
The fields of corn
The Swanee shore

118
00:10:28,775 --> 00:10:31,107
Let it rain
Let it pour

119
00:10:31,177 --> 00:10:35,443
What's more

120
00:10:35,515 --> 00:10:39,110
A cottage
warm and cozy

121
00:10:41,254 --> 00:10:44,382
Or a
Ring-Around-the-Rosy

122
00:10:45,758 --> 00:10:49,319
But I positively
refuse to sing

123
00:10:49,395 --> 00:10:56,597
''['m Headin'for
That Last Roundup''

124
00:10:56,669 --> 00:11:02,471
Get along, little doggie

125
00:11:02,542 --> 00:11:06,478
Get along

126
00:11:18,358 --> 00:11:23,318
Good night
lovely little lady

127
00:11:23,396 --> 00:11:26,524
I must say adieu

128
00:11:26,599 --> 00:11:28,863
To you

129
00:11:28,935 --> 00:11:31,927
And your loveliness

130
00:11:34,974 --> 00:11:37,738
The owner wants to see
you on the upper deck.

131
00:11:37,810 --> 00:11:39,744
Who, me?
At once.

132
00:11:52,258 --> 00:11:55,421
Evening, ma'am.
Good evening.

133
00:11:55,495 --> 00:11:57,463
When I chose you
to take care of Droopy,

134
00:11:57,530 --> 00:12:01,591
I did so because I believed you were
a steady and trustworthy young man.

135
00:12:01,667 --> 00:12:05,728
Yes, ma'am? But when I see you wrestling the
poor creature all over the deck, I believe-

136
00:12:05,805 --> 00:12:08,797
I wasn't wrestling with her.
Why, I saw you.

137
00:12:08,875 --> 00:12:12,834
She was wrestling with me.
Are you being impertinent?

138
00:12:12,912 --> 00:12:16,404
No, no, ma'am. You see,
Droopy only likes one song,

139
00:12:16,482 --> 00:12:20,384
and whenever I sing anything else,
she just naturally ups and throws me.

140
00:12:23,122 --> 00:12:25,556
What's your name?
Stephen, ma'am.

141
00:12:25,625 --> 00:12:29,391
Stephen what?
Just call me Stephen.

142
00:12:29,462 --> 00:12:32,795
I suppose you have a
second name. Oh, yes, ma'am.

143
00:12:39,939 --> 00:12:45,104
Where did you learn to sing?
Oh, I-I just sort of sing.

144
00:12:45,178 --> 00:12:48,147
You sing quite well.
Thank you.

145
00:12:48,214 --> 00:12:50,808
Will you sing
something for us?

146
00:12:50,883 --> 00:12:53,818
Well, if you don't mind,
['d rather not.

147
00:12:53,886 --> 00:12:55,820
We could tie Droopy up.

148
00:12:55,888 --> 00:12:58,083
Just the same,
I- I don't think-

149
00:12:58,157 --> 00:13:02,924
We don't expect you to amuse us for
nothing, my man. He doesn't want your money.

150
00:13:02,995 --> 00:13:05,259
Come on, sailor. Well, I don't know. I-

151
00:13:05,331 --> 00:13:07,856
Of course he will.

152
00:13:13,906 --> 00:13:16,204
Pardon me, darling.

153
00:13:18,377 --> 00:13:22,370
Why does my heart
pound like a hammer

154
00:13:22,448 --> 00:13:25,349
Why do I start
to stutter and stammer

155
00:13:25,418 --> 00:13:29,855
When I'm near
the one I adore

156
00:13:29,922 --> 00:13:33,119
The girl I love

157
00:13:33,192 --> 00:13:37,424
Why is it I'm
the silliest person

158
00:13:37,497 --> 00:13:40,523
Spend all my time
and keep on rehearsin'

159
00:13:40,600 --> 00:13:43,535
A love song

160
00:13:43,603 --> 00:13:46,970
She knows nothing of

161
00:13:48,608 --> 00:13:54,945
[f [ were sure that
[ meant anything to her

162
00:13:55,014 --> 00:13:57,710
I'd be brave

163
00:13:57,783 --> 00:14:00,946
And here's the song
I'd bring to her

164
00:14:01,020 --> 00:14:04,478
I'd sing to her

165
00:14:05,958 --> 00:14:08,358
May I

166
00:14:08,427 --> 00:14:13,126
Be the only one
to say I

167
00:14:13,199 --> 00:14:17,465
Really fell in love
the day I

168
00:14:17,537 --> 00:14:22,065
First set eyes on you

169
00:14:24,944 --> 00:14:27,344
May I

170
00:14:27,413 --> 00:14:31,816
With your
very kind permissión

171
00:14:31,884 --> 00:14:36,719
Tell you that
my one ambition

172
00:14:36,789 --> 00:14:43,251
Is to share a love
affair with you

173
00:14:43,329 --> 00:14:46,730
Here I wait

174
00:14:46,799 --> 00:14:50,030
Do give me my chance

175
00:14:50,102 --> 00:14:53,731
Do tell me my fate

176
00:14:53,806 --> 00:14:58,903
What is your answer

177
00:15:00,446 --> 00:15:03,438
May I

178
00:15:03,516 --> 00:15:07,612
Hold you to my heart
and pray I

179
00:15:07,687 --> 00:15:11,748
Will be there beside you
when they groom and bride you

180
00:15:11,824 --> 00:15:14,588
May [ hear you say

181
00:15:14,660 --> 00:15:17,185
I do

182
00:15:19,332 --> 00:15:22,927
Oh, may I

183
00:15:23,002 --> 00:15:27,462
Be the only one
to say I

184
00:15:27,540 --> 00:15:31,840
Really fell in love
the day I

185
00:15:31,911 --> 00:15:36,405
Oh, the day that
I set eyes on you

186
00:15:39,018 --> 00:15:41,043
May I

187
00:15:41,120 --> 00:15:45,614
With your
very kind permissión

188
00:15:45,691 --> 00:15:49,627
Tell you that
my one ambition

189
00:15:49,695 --> 00:15:52,129
Is to share

190
00:15:52,198 --> 00:15:56,134
Oh, to share that
love affair with you

191
00:15:57,436 --> 00:16:00,997
Here [ wait

192
00:16:01,073 --> 00:16:06,033
Do give me my chance

193
00:16:06,112 --> 00:16:10,276
Do tell me my fate

194
00:16:10,349 --> 00:16:15,286
What is your answer

195
00:16:15,354 --> 00:16:17,686
May I

196
00:16:17,757 --> 00:16:22,353
Hold you to my heart
and pray I

197
00:16:22,428 --> 00:16:26,694
Will be there beside you
when they groom and bride you

198
00:16:26,766 --> 00:16:29,200
May I hear you say

199
00:16:29,268 --> 00:16:35,264
I do

200
00:16:42,214 --> 00:16:48,380
Good night,
lovely little lady

201
00:16:55,895 --> 00:16:58,762
I believe you taught her
that trick yourself.

202
00:16:58,831 --> 00:17:00,890
Yes, ma'am.

203
00:17:00,966 --> 00:17:04,902
Anyhow I think you better give Droopy
some exercise. She looks stuffy.

204
00:17:04,970 --> 00:17:07,234
Yes, ma'am.

205
00:17:09,141 --> 00:17:13,305
Uh, Doris, ['m not sure the sailor and the
bear should be allowed to parade this deck.

206
00:17:13,379 --> 00:17:17,145
Why not, when you think of the
other things that parade this deck.

207
00:17:17,216 --> 00:17:20,276
Ha! We're playing bridge.

208
00:17:22,922 --> 00:17:25,857
Uncle Hubert,
couldn't you manage...

209
00:17:25,925 --> 00:17:28,917
to be a little less rude to Prince
Michael and Prince Alexander?

210
00:17:28,994 --> 00:17:32,020
I don't like 'em. They're
really very nice boys.

211
00:17:32,098 --> 00:17:35,829
I know. I know. They dance beautifully,
probably knit beautifully too.

212
00:17:35,901 --> 00:17:37,892
But I don't like 'em.

213
00:17:37,970 --> 00:17:41,701
You better had. They want
to marry me. Both of them?

214
00:17:41,774 --> 00:17:45,835
Yes. That's what makes it so
difficult; I can only marry one.

215
00:17:45,911 --> 00:17:49,472
Well, don't stint yourself. You
know you can afford both of them.

216
00:17:49,548 --> 00:17:53,678
Now, Uncle Hubert, don't be unkind.
The Siamese twins married one girl.

217
00:17:53,753 --> 00:17:57,553
They're not Siamese. Well, I
could paste 'em together for you.

218
00:17:57,623 --> 00:18:00,558
Even then,
you wouldn't have a man.

219
00:18:08,567 --> 00:18:13,197
Ah! Well, you know, I'm very
fond of that animal. Aren't you?

220
00:18:13,272 --> 00:18:16,139
Who, me? Oh, yes,
I'm very attached to her.

221
00:18:16,208 --> 00:18:20,076
Say, what would you
think about giving her...

222
00:18:20,146 --> 00:18:23,547
a little more scope
when you exercise her?

223
00:18:23,616 --> 00:18:26,608
How do you mean?
Well, uh-

224
00:18:26,685 --> 00:18:30,678
Wait just a minute. Just
a minute. Right here.

225
00:18:30,756 --> 00:18:33,418
Well, how about these?

226
00:18:33,492 --> 00:18:37,485
I hardly think the owner would
want me to go skating about, sir.

227
00:18:37,563 --> 00:18:41,863
Oh, no, no, not for you.
Let's put 'em on Droopy.

228
00:18:41,934 --> 00:18:46,030
Droopy? Yes. Then she'll
get twice the exercise.

229
00:18:46,105 --> 00:18:48,198
Don't you see?

230
00:18:48,274 --> 00:18:51,675
Yes, sir. Yeah. Come
on, Droopy, old girl.

231
00:18:51,744 --> 00:18:53,939
Come on.

232
00:19:00,719 --> 00:19:05,520
All right, get her up.

233
00:19:05,591 --> 00:19:08,458
There you are.

234
00:19:08,527 --> 00:19:10,620
Hey!

235
00:19:22,842 --> 00:19:24,810
Look out!
Look out!

236
00:19:27,713 --> 00:19:31,843
- Hello. Oh, I-I-
- I'll murder that sailor!

237
00:19:35,354 --> 00:19:38,482
He should be put in irons!
And fed on bread and water.

238
00:19:38,557 --> 00:19:42,391
Look out.!
Look out.!

239
00:19:44,697 --> 00:19:48,098
The lad is teaching that bear too
fast. But can you imagine that?

240
00:19:48,167 --> 00:19:52,228
Fancy skating lessons the first
time out. Hold her, sailor.

241
00:19:52,304 --> 00:19:55,171
This is insufferable! The
man must be out of his mind.

242
00:19:55,241 --> 00:19:58,301
- Anybody get hurt?
- I did, but not where it shows.

243
00:19:58,377 --> 00:20:02,643
In my country, the man would be
taught a lesson he'd never forget.

244
00:20:02,715 --> 00:20:04,876
The lad meant no harm.

245
00:20:04,950 --> 00:20:08,442
Put Droopy to bed and come back
here and wait for me. Yes, ma'am.

246
00:20:08,521 --> 00:20:12,457
I should report you to the
Captain to be disciplined,

247
00:20:12,525 --> 00:20:16,359
but I prefer to deal with
you myself. Yes, ma'am.

248
00:20:16,428 --> 00:20:19,522
He's the freshest sailor
I've ever seen.

249
00:20:19,598 --> 00:20:23,261
Ah, but he's cute.

250
00:20:23,335 --> 00:20:26,270
If you'd only give me
the right to protect you.

251
00:20:26,338 --> 00:20:30,707
Oh, Doris, if I were your husband, such
things as this would never happen to you.

252
00:20:30,776 --> 00:20:35,042
Well, anyway,
who wants to walk?

253
00:20:35,114 --> 00:20:38,106
Hubert, I want one.
You want one?

254
00:20:38,183 --> 00:20:40,651
I want a prince.

255
00:20:40,719 --> 00:20:43,745
I want a drink,
a great big drink.

256
00:20:46,358 --> 00:20:48,417
She walks like you

257
00:20:48,494 --> 00:20:50,826
She talks like you

258
00:20:50,896 --> 00:20:54,957
Says pretty little things
just the way you do

259
00:20:55,034 --> 00:20:58,765
So I fell in love with her

260
00:20:58,837 --> 00:21:02,739
Because she
reminds me of you

261
00:21:02,808 --> 00:21:04,901
She doubts like you

262
00:21:04,977 --> 00:21:07,036
She pouts like you

263
00:21:07,112 --> 00:21:10,878
Always keeps on telling me
that I'm untrue

264
00:21:10,950 --> 00:21:15,114
So I fell in love with her

265
00:21:15,187 --> 00:21:18,054
Because she
reminds me of you

266
00:21:18,123 --> 00:21:23,459
Now time and time
I've called her by your name

267
00:21:23,529 --> 00:21:26,794
And our love
I never have denied

268
00:21:26,865 --> 00:21:31,461
But she said if I loved her
half as much as I love you

269
00:21:31,537 --> 00:21:35,405
She'd be more than satisfied

270
00:21:35,474 --> 00:21:37,533
She sighs like you

271
00:21:37,610 --> 00:21:40,078
She cries like you

272
00:21:40,145 --> 00:21:43,740
Always keeps on telling me
that I'm untrue

273
00:21:43,816 --> 00:21:46,341
But I fell in love with her

274
00:21:47,820 --> 00:21:52,655
Because she
reminds me of you

275
00:21:55,327 --> 00:22:00,287
Angry, Hubert? No, I'm
not angry. I'm just hurt.

276
00:22:00,366 --> 00:22:03,426
I had a vague idea
we were engaged to be married.

277
00:22:03,502 --> 00:22:08,371
I'm perfectly willing to marry you,
but first I want you to buy me a prince.

278
00:22:08,440 --> 00:22:11,170
What are you gonna do
with it, have it stuffed?

279
00:22:11,243 --> 00:22:14,770
No, I wanna marry it.
I- What?

280
00:22:14,847 --> 00:22:18,715
Then when I'm a princess,
I'll divorce him and marry you.

281
00:22:25,557 --> 00:22:28,549
Well? You asked me to come back.

282
00:22:28,627 --> 00:22:31,824
Haven't you anything to say
about your extraordinary behavior?

283
00:22:31,897 --> 00:22:36,800
I'm sorry it happened, and I said
so. What made you do such a thing?

284
00:22:36,869 --> 00:22:39,929
The reason one does things
isn't always clear.

285
00:22:40,005 --> 00:22:43,805
It's perfectly clear to me.
You did it because you're fresh,

286
00:22:43,876 --> 00:22:48,142
irresponsible, indifferent to the decorum
of my ship and safety of my guests.

287
00:22:48,213 --> 00:22:50,181
Isn't that true?

288
00:22:50,249 --> 00:22:52,376
Answer me!

289
00:22:52,451 --> 00:22:57,047
Well, I-I wouldn't say that. A full grown
man who should be doing something useful...

290
00:22:57,122 --> 00:23:00,057
like trying to rise
in your professión,

291
00:23:00,125 --> 00:23:03,322
making yourself fit to command
a ship of your own someday.

292
00:23:03,395 --> 00:23:07,297
But you haven't anything on your mind but
singing songs or playing games with bears.

293
00:23:07,366 --> 00:23:10,665
I also scrub decks.
You are being impertinent.

294
00:23:10,736 --> 00:23:15,036
I haven't said anything
disrespectful... yet.

295
00:23:15,107 --> 00:23:17,507
You annoy me so,
I could slap your face.

296
00:23:17,576 --> 00:23:21,012
Well, if it would make
you feel any better.

297
00:23:22,581 --> 00:23:26,483
Ohh! Is there anything else, ma'am?

298
00:23:26,552 --> 00:23:29,544
Get below and never put
your foot on this deck again!

299
00:23:29,621 --> 00:23:33,387
The next port we touch, you're
dismissed! Yes, ma'am. Good night.

300
00:23:56,782 --> 00:24:00,047
Fog lifting any? No sign of it yet, sir.

301
00:24:01,820 --> 00:24:05,221
[f some sweet bambino
says you are his queen-o

302
00:24:05,290 --> 00:24:08,088
Then in some casino
he fills you with vino

303
00:24:08,160 --> 00:24:11,027
The charts!
They're overboard!

304
00:24:13,132 --> 00:24:17,432
Charts. Don't be silly. Christopher
Columbus never had any charts.

305
00:24:17,503 --> 00:24:20,472
It's more sporting,
more exciting...

306
00:24:20,539 --> 00:24:24,737
to sail out
into the unknown.

307
00:24:24,810 --> 00:24:28,678
Now see what you've done now. Take
the wheel. I'll call the skipper.

308
00:24:28,747 --> 00:24:31,682
No, no, no, don't bother.
Don't bother.

309
00:24:31,750 --> 00:24:36,050
I'll steer this ship like the ancient Phoenicians
- by the stars.

310
00:24:36,121 --> 00:24:38,851
This is serious, sir.
Oh, calm yourself.

311
00:24:38,924 --> 00:24:43,258
Men nowadays use too many
gadgets. There's the North Star.

312
00:24:43,328 --> 00:24:46,161
The North Star is there.

313
00:24:46,231 --> 00:24:50,565
That's the North Star. I'll
show you. Just a minute.

314
00:25:00,012 --> 00:25:02,810
We're on a reef!.

315
00:25:02,881 --> 00:25:05,941
Close all watertight doors!

316
00:25:06,018 --> 00:25:08,543
Three feet of water
in the port hold, sir.

317
00:25:08,620 --> 00:25:12,420
Everybody on deck, and put
on your life preservers!

318
00:25:12,491 --> 00:25:14,482
We're sinking!

319
00:25:14,560 --> 00:25:18,587
The owner and passengers will
leave in Mr.Johnson's boat.

320
00:25:27,072 --> 00:25:29,540
Everything is okay now,
my darling.

321
00:25:29,608 --> 00:25:33,009
Captain said to shove
off at once. Right.

322
00:25:34,513 --> 00:25:36,913
Are you coming?
One minute.

323
00:25:36,982 --> 00:25:40,918
Don't worry, Edith.
I'll save you.

324
00:25:44,489 --> 00:25:47,515
She's filling up fast, sir.
Stand by the pumps.

325
00:25:47,593 --> 00:25:49,686
Where you goin'?
I forgot Droopy, sir.

326
00:25:49,761 --> 00:25:51,820
Hurry up, Doris!
We're sinking!

327
00:25:51,897 --> 00:25:55,458
- Soon as I get my clothes on!
- A life preserver's more important.

328
00:25:55,534 --> 00:25:58,469
I haven't got one!

329
00:25:58,537 --> 00:26:02,530
We'll save you!

330
00:26:11,917 --> 00:26:15,045
I'm practically
in the water now.

331
00:26:16,989 --> 00:26:19,219
Hubert!

332
00:26:23,896 --> 00:26:27,093
There goes our sea skate!

333
00:26:35,974 --> 00:26:37,635
Look, Droopy!

334
00:27:10,075 --> 00:27:12,805
Good night

335
00:27:12,878 --> 00:27:16,405
Lovely little lady

336
00:27:16,481 --> 00:27:20,679
[ must say adieu to you

337
00:27:20,752 --> 00:27:24,882
And your loveliness

338
00:27:24,957 --> 00:27:27,357
Good night

339
00:27:27,426 --> 00:27:31,328
Lovely little lady

340
00:27:31,396 --> 00:27:35,890
How it makes me grieve
to leave

341
00:27:35,968 --> 00:27:38,937
The charms you possess

342
00:27:39,004 --> 00:27:43,441
For when you are gone
my dear

343
00:27:43,508 --> 00:27:46,477
How lonely it seems

344
00:27:46,545 --> 00:27:51,005
But we'll meet again
my dear

345
00:27:51,083 --> 00:27:55,486
On a pillow of love
'neath a blanket of green

346
00:27:55,554 --> 00:28:01,891
So good night
lovely little lady

347
00:28:01,960 --> 00:28:04,895
Oh, let us kiss again

348
00:28:04,963 --> 00:28:08,922
And then good night

349
00:28:09,001 --> 00:28:11,196
Many brave hearts

350
00:28:11,269 --> 00:28:15,296
Are asleep
in the deep

351
00:28:15,374 --> 00:28:19,640
Well, good night

352
00:28:19,711 --> 00:28:23,738
Lovely little lady

353
00:28:23,815 --> 00:28:28,047
I must say adieu to you

354
00:28:28,120 --> 00:28:31,283
And your loveliness

355
00:28:31,356 --> 00:28:34,814
[s that you, sailor?

356
00:28:34,893 --> 00:28:37,191
Yoo-hoo!

357
00:28:37,262 --> 00:28:40,789
Hey, sailor!
Yoo-hoo.!

358
00:28:40,866 --> 00:28:42,800
Yell in English!

359
00:28:42,868 --> 00:28:48,101
- Well, where are ya?
- Somewhere in the Pacific Ocean!

360
00:28:48,173 --> 00:28:51,370
Well, keep on yellin'!
We'll get together!

361
00:28:51,443 --> 00:28:54,003
Yoo-hoo.!
Yoo-hoo!

362
00:28:54,079 --> 00:28:56,980
Yoo-hoo!
Yoo-hoo.!

363
00:28:57,049 --> 00:28:59,040
Yoo-hoo!

364
00:28:59,117 --> 00:29:03,213
Yoo-hoo!
Yoo-hoo.!

365
00:29:03,288 --> 00:29:08,225
Ah, there you are. Well, how ya
doin'? Let go of that poor animal.

366
00:29:08,293 --> 00:29:10,921
I can't. I haven't got
any life preserver.

367
00:29:10,996 --> 00:29:14,363
No, you wouldn't have. That's
what's the matter with my yacht-

368
00:29:14,433 --> 00:29:18,028
sailors who haven't sense enough to wear
a life preserver when the ship's sinking.

369
00:29:18,103 --> 00:29:21,470
I should fire you. Ah, but
you did. Don't you remember?

370
00:29:21,540 --> 00:29:24,907
You're still fired.
Okay, okay. Pay me off.

371
00:29:24,976 --> 00:29:26,876
Hmph! Think you're funny?
Quiet!

372
00:29:26,945 --> 00:29:30,745
I'll talk as much as I
- Shut up! I think I hear land.

373
00:29:30,816 --> 00:29:34,752
You hear land? Do I have to
duck you to keep you quiet?

374
00:29:34,820 --> 00:29:36,845
You wouldn't dare.

375
00:29:36,922 --> 00:29:42,417
Oh! With the whole Pacific Ocean to
swim in, I'd have to bump into you!

376
00:29:42,494 --> 00:29:44,860
Get along little Droopy Get along

377
00:29:44,930 --> 00:29:49,390
Work for the night
is coming

378
00:29:49,468 --> 00:29:53,029
Work through
the morning hours

379
00:29:53,105 --> 00:29:55,164
Work while-

380
00:29:55,240 --> 00:29:57,640
This is beginning
to depress me.

381
00:29:57,709 --> 00:30:01,110
We're still on our first day,
so you better keep your chin up.

382
00:30:01,179 --> 00:30:05,013
My chin is fine. The trouble is with
my chassis. Come on. It's your turn.

383
00:30:05,083 --> 00:30:08,052
All right. What's the
idea of the scotch?

384
00:30:08,120 --> 00:30:11,521
Oh, I brought it along
in case. [n case. Get it?

385
00:30:11,590 --> 00:30:14,184
I bet the answer's funny.

386
00:30:14,259 --> 00:30:18,855
Work for the night
is coming

387
00:30:18,930 --> 00:30:22,593
Work through
the morning hours

388
00:30:22,667 --> 00:30:26,501
Work while
the dew is sparkling

389
00:30:26,571 --> 00:30:30,871
If you'd kept out of it, I might have
married her before the yacht crashed.

390
00:30:30,942 --> 00:30:34,105
Yeah. Then you'd have had her
money. Well, now nobody's got it.

391
00:30:35,547 --> 00:30:37,538
Look! We're in!

392
00:30:56,368 --> 00:30:59,201
Put me down! Oh, I can't let you drown.

393
00:30:59,271 --> 00:31:04,299
Put me down, sailor! Don't be any
more annoying than you can help.

394
00:31:04,376 --> 00:31:06,640
Ooh!

395
00:31:17,622 --> 00:31:21,490
You put me down, all right!
Looks like a nice little island.

396
00:31:21,560 --> 00:31:25,519
Looks pretty lonesome. Did
everybody else get off on lifeboats?

397
00:31:25,597 --> 00:31:29,590
I don't know. Oh, the boys were
getting me a life preserver.

398
00:31:29,668 --> 00:31:33,570
One of them did. Do you know
which one? No, you wouldn't.

399
00:31:33,638 --> 00:31:36,766
Well, you might tell me what
you think happened to 'em.

400
00:31:36,841 --> 00:31:40,333
Well, there's a chance
they might have drowned.

401
00:31:46,651 --> 00:31:49,381
Why, with this sun,
we ought to be dry in no time.

402
00:31:49,454 --> 00:31:53,254
I can't stand these wet
clothes a minute longer.

403
00:31:53,325 --> 00:31:56,726
Then you better get
up there and take 'em off.

404
00:32:10,442 --> 00:32:13,104
Sailor,
wring that out for me.

405
00:32:15,213 --> 00:32:18,182
It hurts me to tell you this,
but you'll have to get along...

406
00:32:18,250 --> 00:32:21,651
without a lady's man
for a time.

407
00:32:24,956 --> 00:32:28,915
I hate to tell you this, but I'm
gonna bounce this rock on your head...

408
00:32:28,994 --> 00:32:31,462
as soon as [ get dressed.

409
00:32:31,529 --> 00:32:35,556
Ah-ah. Remember what happened
when you just slapped me.

410
00:32:37,969 --> 00:32:42,429
Well, don't be unsociable, sailor.
Let's try and get along.

411
00:32:45,377 --> 00:32:48,972
Well, look.
At what?

412
00:32:49,047 --> 00:32:52,483
The boys.
The boys!

413
00:32:52,550 --> 00:32:56,509
Well, don't stand there.
Go help them. Do something.

414
00:32:56,588 --> 00:32:58,681
Right this way.

415
00:33:03,995 --> 00:33:07,089
Hey, sailor,
pull us ashore!

416
00:33:10,335 --> 00:33:12,633
Yes, sir!

417
00:33:21,413 --> 00:33:23,381
Come on.!

418
00:33:39,097 --> 00:33:40,826
Nuts.

419
00:33:40,899 --> 00:33:44,892
You're safe. That's the important
thing. All those hours thinking you lost.

420
00:33:44,969 --> 00:33:48,336
Which one of you saved me? Well, I, uh-

421
00:33:49,808 --> 00:33:53,005
Well, don't be modest
about it. Tell me. Doris.!

422
00:33:54,746 --> 00:33:56,714
Darling! Ohh!
Honey!

423
00:33:56,781 --> 00:34:00,581
Well, Doris! Oh, Uncle Hubert!
Thank heavens you're safe!

424
00:34:00,652 --> 00:34:02,984
Da- Ohh.

425
00:34:03,054 --> 00:34:06,546
The shipwreck hasn't turned
out as well as I'd hoped.

426
00:34:06,624 --> 00:34:10,082
Oh, hello, sailor. I
wish we could dry out.

427
00:34:10,161 --> 00:34:13,062
Sailor, build a fire.
Hurry up. I'm hungry.

428
00:34:13,131 --> 00:34:16,328
Breakfast. That's an idea.
Where are we gonna get it?

429
00:34:16,401 --> 00:34:19,632
- There must be things to eat.
- This is an island, probably uninhabited.

430
00:34:19,704 --> 00:34:22,673
Well, the first thing is
a fire. Have you matches?

431
00:34:22,741 --> 00:34:25,209
Can you cook?
Certainly.

432
00:34:25,276 --> 00:34:29,007
- Swell. Then we can have some breakfast.
- Not anything that takes long.

433
00:34:29,080 --> 00:34:31,810
I'm famished. Something simple
- a fish, for example.

434
00:34:31,883 --> 00:34:35,546
We'll leave the menu to you. I think
maybe we better get one thing straight.

435
00:34:35,620 --> 00:34:38,589
We're on an island in the
middle of the Pacific Ocean.

436
00:34:38,656 --> 00:34:42,592
There's nobody here to fetch and
carry for you. Well, what's he mean?

437
00:34:42,660 --> 00:34:45,720
I fired him. This seems
to be a devil of a time-

438
00:34:45,797 --> 00:34:50,496
You'll be well-paid for any- You can cut
that. We're off the gold standard here.

439
00:34:50,568 --> 00:34:56,336
What do you expect us to do? The last
thing that you'd ever think of. Work.

440
00:34:56,408 --> 00:35:00,538
See, I'm willing to do all I can,
but you got to help yourselves.

441
00:35:00,612 --> 00:35:04,548
Gather driftwood, dig clams, pack water,
build a shelter. What are you gonna do?

442
00:35:04,616 --> 00:35:09,315
Well, I'll show you how if you wish.
You mean you're gonna run things?

443
00:35:10,822 --> 00:35:13,916
Well, it looks as though I'd
have to. You seem to forget-

444
00:35:13,992 --> 00:35:17,689
You can take it or leave it.
Naturally, we don't take it.

445
00:35:17,762 --> 00:35:20,595
Can't take it, you mean.
''Don't take it,'' I said.

446
00:35:20,665 --> 00:35:23,634
Okay. I didn't suggest it.
You got hungry.

447
00:35:25,236 --> 00:35:28,103
Well, now don't you think
you were a little hasty, dear?

448
00:35:28,173 --> 00:35:31,040
We'll probably starve.
Oh, we'll look after you.

449
00:35:31,109 --> 00:35:34,237
Just leave everything to
us. Now I know we'll starve.

450
00:35:39,651 --> 00:35:43,109
Aah!

451
00:35:44,522 --> 00:35:47,514
Oh! Ohhh!

452
00:35:47,592 --> 00:35:51,619
My lingerie. It's a
blessing you're not in them.

453
00:36:04,843 --> 00:36:07,937
Gracie, you've lost something. Yeah
- Oh.

454
00:36:15,019 --> 00:36:19,183
Aw. Oh, thanks, George.
Thanks a lot.

455
00:36:19,257 --> 00:36:21,418
Thanks for what?
For my panties.

456
00:36:21,493 --> 00:36:24,985
I know better than to ask you, but
what are you talking about? My panties.

457
00:36:25,063 --> 00:36:28,658
It was sweet of you to buy them
for me, and such a surprise too.

458
00:36:28,733 --> 00:36:32,430
Listen, we're in the middle of
the ocean on an uninhabited island.

459
00:36:32,504 --> 00:36:36,838
We are here collecting species of flora
and fauna. What station are they on?

460
00:36:36,908 --> 00:36:41,709
What station are they on?
They're not on the radio. Yes.

461
00:36:41,779 --> 00:36:45,715
Flora are plants and fauna are animals.
Flora and Fauna will be on the radio...

462
00:36:45,783 --> 00:36:50,482
because that combination sounds as good
as Amos and Andy, don't you think so?

463
00:36:50,555 --> 00:36:52,455
I think so.

464
00:36:52,524 --> 00:36:56,460
Listen, what I'm trying to say to you is
that there are no stores on the island.

465
00:36:56,528 --> 00:36:59,554
Where would I buy panties?
Well, I give up, George,

466
00:36:59,631 --> 00:37:02,464
but why don't you buy 'em in
the same place you bought these?

467
00:37:02,534 --> 00:37:06,265
Yes, well
- Stop it. Stop it. You're getting daffy.

468
00:37:06,337 --> 00:37:10,535
George, another surprise. Am I getting
a one-pound box or a two-pound box?

469
00:37:10,608 --> 00:37:14,601
I love daffy. That's my favorite
candy. Stop it. You're getting nuts.

470
00:37:14,679 --> 00:37:18,615
If it's just the same to you,
could I have daffy without nuts?

471
00:37:18,683 --> 00:37:22,414
I've had it with nuts. Listen, try
to understand what I'm talking about.

472
00:37:22,487 --> 00:37:26,423
You're just plain daffy. Now that's what I want
- just plain daffy.

473
00:37:26,491 --> 00:37:30,188
I'm crazy about just
plain daffy. You're crazy.

474
00:37:30,261 --> 00:37:34,391
My map! My map of the island! This
is the result of two months surveying!

475
00:37:34,465 --> 00:37:38,458
What is all this? What are these
little marks? Those are my inventions.

476
00:37:38,536 --> 00:37:41,437
That's my moose trap.
Moose trap?

477
00:37:41,506 --> 00:37:45,408
You probably mean a mousetrap. Oh,
no. This is for more than one mouse.

478
00:37:45,476 --> 00:37:48,468
You see, two mouse
make a mice.

479
00:37:48,546 --> 00:37:51,538
And two mice make a moose.
And two mice make a moose?

480
00:37:51,616 --> 00:37:55,484
How is this silly invention of yours
gonna catch moose? Well, it doesn't.

481
00:37:55,553 --> 00:37:58,522
It catches lions and
tigers. Lions and tigers?

482
00:37:58,590 --> 00:38:01,616
Well, sure. You see,
it has a sign on the trap.

483
00:38:01,693 --> 00:38:05,754
It says, ''Keep out. For moose
only.'' That explains it, I guess.

484
00:38:05,830 --> 00:38:08,765
And the lions and tigers
can't read,

485
00:38:08,833 --> 00:38:11,563
So they go in and get caught.
so they go in and get caught.

486
00:38:11,636 --> 00:38:15,094
I wanna show you my invention. You couldn't
invent something that would make you disappear.

487
00:38:15,173 --> 00:38:17,164
Well, I'm working
on that. Come on.

488
00:38:21,980 --> 00:38:25,416
Look. Footprints.
Where do they come from?

489
00:38:25,483 --> 00:38:28,475
What are they doing here?
Well, that's part of my trap.

490
00:38:28,553 --> 00:38:31,989
Animals always follow
footprints, you know. I-

491
00:38:32,056 --> 00:38:36,823
What are you doing? I'm picking up the
footprints so the animals won't follow us.

492
00:38:36,894 --> 00:38:39,829
''So the animals won't follow us''? Yes.

493
00:38:39,897 --> 00:38:42,764
It's part of your invention. That
came right out of my own head.

494
00:38:42,834 --> 00:38:45,632
I'd have it stuffed. Your head. My head?

495
00:38:45,703 --> 00:38:49,139
Oh, I have brains.
Animals.

496
00:38:49,207 --> 00:38:52,301
My shaving mirror.
I've been looking for it for days.

497
00:38:52,377 --> 00:38:55,312
Well, that's part
of my invention also.

498
00:38:55,380 --> 00:38:59,316
You see, the lion sees himself in the
mirror and thinks it's another lion.

499
00:38:59,384 --> 00:39:04,014
So he, the real lion, snatches the piece
of meat so the other lion won't get it.

500
00:39:04,088 --> 00:39:08,024
I'll see you later. Don't go,
George. I haven't finished yet.

501
00:39:08,092 --> 00:39:12,188
Now, look. You be the lion and
pull the string. Pull the string.

502
00:39:12,263 --> 00:39:14,231
Moose trap.

503
00:39:14,298 --> 00:39:16,459
There you are.

504
00:39:16,534 --> 00:39:18,593
Come on, George.

505
00:39:20,605 --> 00:39:23,699
Well... who is that?
Well, that's Uncle Fred.

506
00:39:23,775 --> 00:39:27,142
He frightens the lions. No,
he really doesn't do anything.

507
00:39:27,211 --> 00:39:32,342
Ya see, he was always very kind to animals,
so I just put him there out of sentiment.

508
00:39:32,417 --> 00:39:34,942
Come on, George.

509
00:39:36,754 --> 00:39:41,191
And this-This is a barrel. I'm glad
you told me because for a minute,

510
00:39:41,259 --> 00:39:44,194
I thought that was a barrel.
Yeah.

511
00:39:44,262 --> 00:39:46,230
There ya go.
Quiet. Quiet.

512
00:39:46,297 --> 00:39:49,027
George, kick the coconut.
Kick? I'll be glad to.

513
00:39:53,805 --> 00:39:57,070
Oh, this next one
will get ya.

514
00:40:06,617 --> 00:40:09,518
Clever. Don't you think so? I think so.

515
00:40:09,587 --> 00:40:11,851
Did you notice the camera? Yes.

516
00:40:11,923 --> 00:40:15,723
In case the lion gets away, then
we always have a picture of it.

517
00:40:15,793 --> 00:40:19,058
And the music soothes the savage
beast. Soothes the savage beast.

518
00:40:19,130 --> 00:40:22,896
Is that gun loaded? Oh, sure. If
you pull on the rope, it goes boom.

519
00:40:22,967 --> 00:40:24,958
It goes boom?
Oh, yeah.

520
00:40:25,036 --> 00:40:29,439
Let me out of here! I'd like to, but
I have to wait until it gets dark.

521
00:40:29,507 --> 00:40:33,204
Good and dark? Well, sure
because if I let you out now,

522
00:40:33,277 --> 00:40:36,906
the animals might see me, and
then they'll know how to get out.

523
00:40:36,981 --> 00:40:40,109
Well, good-bye, George.
I'll see ya sometime tonight.

524
00:40:40,184 --> 00:40:42,152
Gracie.
Good-bye, George.

525
00:40:42,220 --> 00:40:45,155
Gracie! Gracie! Good-bye.!
Good-bye, George.!

526
00:40:56,901 --> 00:41:01,395
Never treat others
with scorn

527
00:41:01,472 --> 00:41:06,136
We're only here
'cause we're born

528
00:41:06,210 --> 00:41:09,043
Although you're way up

529
00:41:09,113 --> 00:41:12,674
You may not stay up

530
00:41:12,750 --> 00:41:17,949
Stop tootin' your horn

531
00:41:18,022 --> 00:41:22,686
Why boast of the wealth you possess

532
00:41:22,760 --> 00:41:26,287
High on the hill
of success

533
00:41:26,364 --> 00:41:32,428
On friendship
you never should frown

534
00:41:32,503 --> 00:41:36,633
You'll need
the same friends

535
00:41:36,707 --> 00:41:41,406
On the weary way down

536
00:41:41,479 --> 00:41:47,543
So love thy neighbor

537
00:41:47,618 --> 00:41:51,782
Walk up and say
how be ya

538
00:41:51,856 --> 00:41:55,917
Gee, but I'm glad
to see ya, pal

539
00:41:55,993 --> 00:41:59,019
How's tricks
What's new

540
00:42:00,598 --> 00:42:04,056
Love thy neighbor

541
00:42:04,135 --> 00:42:07,468
Offer to share
his burden

542
00:42:07,538 --> 00:42:11,634
Tell him
to say the word 'n'

543
00:42:11,709 --> 00:42:16,078
You will
see him through

544
00:42:16,147 --> 00:42:20,106
'Specially
if there should be

545
00:42:20,184 --> 00:42:23,517
A beautiful girl
next door

546
00:42:23,588 --> 00:42:28,048
Say to that girl
next door

547
00:42:28,125 --> 00:42:29,888
Now don't
think ['m bold

548
00:42:29,961 --> 00:42:36,196
But my mother told me
to love thy neighbor

549
00:42:36,267 --> 00:42:40,294
And you will find
your labor

550
00:42:40,371 --> 00:42:44,137
A great deal easier
Life will be breezier

551
00:42:44,208 --> 00:42:47,700
If you love thy neighbor

552
00:43:03,961 --> 00:43:06,896
How will we live? What'll
we do? What'll we eat?

553
00:43:06,964 --> 00:43:12,129
We'll live on the milk of human
kindness and coconuts to you.

554
00:43:12,203 --> 00:43:16,037
I could live here forever.
It's wonderful. It's grand.

555
00:43:16,107 --> 00:43:20,066
Especially when a charming
neighbor lends such a helping hand.

556
00:43:20,144 --> 00:43:24,342
Oh, let's be domestic
happy and love nest-ic

557
00:43:24,415 --> 00:43:28,852
Let's begin to turn this
into an island of joy

558
00:43:28,920 --> 00:43:32,378
You'll be the papa
and I'll be the mama

559
00:43:32,456 --> 00:43:35,448
We'll be
a hubby and spouse

560
00:43:35,526 --> 00:43:38,791
You wash the dishes
I'll look at Ballyhoo

561
00:43:38,863 --> 00:43:41,923
Let's play house

562
00:43:41,999 --> 00:43:45,264
Own your own home,
the acme of perfection.

563
00:43:45,336 --> 00:43:48,828
And the customer is always
right. We're open for inspection.

564
00:43:48,906 --> 00:43:52,569
Inquire on the premises. If
nothing suits you, we will alter.

565
00:43:52,643 --> 00:43:56,101
For when a home is built
on the foundation of love,

566
00:43:56,180 --> 00:43:59,581
it's as strong as
the rocks of''Gibraltinter.''

567
00:43:59,650 --> 00:44:03,518
Uh, Gi-Gi-Gibraltar. There
it stands, yawning invitingly.

568
00:44:03,587 --> 00:44:05,919
Into its fold
let's creep.

569
00:44:14,198 --> 00:44:16,666
It was yawnin', Massa.
It was yawnin',

570
00:44:16,734 --> 00:44:19,498
but it's rolled over
and done gone to sleep.

571
00:44:19,570 --> 00:44:23,267
'Specially
should there be

572
00:44:23,341 --> 00:44:26,674
A beautiful girl
next door

573
00:44:26,744 --> 00:44:31,010
I will say to that
girl next door

574
00:44:31,082 --> 00:44:33,346
Now don't think I'm bold

575
00:44:33,417 --> 00:44:38,821
My mama told me
to love thy neighbor

576
00:44:38,889 --> 00:44:42,757
And you will find
your labor

577
00:44:42,827 --> 00:44:46,627
A great deal easier
Life will be breezier

578
00:44:46,697 --> 00:44:53,728
If you love
thy neighbor

579
00:45:02,780 --> 00:45:06,409
I'll never go on another
uninhabited island.

580
00:45:06,484 --> 00:45:09,453
I don't care
who lives there.

581
00:45:36,347 --> 00:45:38,542
Quitters!

582
00:45:42,520 --> 00:45:44,954
Could we help you
in a nice way?

583
00:45:45,022 --> 00:45:47,991
I'll set the table and
wash the dishes afterwards.

584
00:45:48,059 --> 00:45:51,495
If you want anything to eat,
you'll have to go dig some clams.

585
00:45:51,562 --> 00:45:56,659
Maybe if I made a noise like a female
clam, they'd come out by themselves.

586
00:45:56,734 --> 00:45:58,827
Come on, dear.

587
00:46:07,344 --> 00:46:10,507
Maybe the sailor has a match. No!

588
00:46:16,987 --> 00:46:19,956
Well, not so gently.
Hit it hard.

589
00:46:20,024 --> 00:46:23,983
I was only trying to act like a
lady. Why, with all your talents?

590
00:46:24,061 --> 00:46:27,121
Oh, it's no use.

591
00:46:27,198 --> 00:46:30,292
That's what I thought.

592
00:46:30,367 --> 00:46:33,859
I think maybe I'll go borrow
a light from the sailor.

593
00:46:33,938 --> 00:46:36,338
I think maybe
I'll go with you.

594
00:46:36,407 --> 00:46:40,867
All right. If that's
what you want to do.

595
00:46:46,717 --> 00:46:50,653
Could we be of any
assistance to you?

596
00:46:50,721 --> 00:46:53,849
Go up there and gather
some wood... both of you.

597
00:47:18,449 --> 00:47:21,475
Anybody care to drink
a little dessert?

598
00:47:21,552 --> 00:47:24,953
Did you ever see
anyone so stubborn?

599
00:47:38,536 --> 00:47:42,404
Well, sir, everything a man
needs to live is right here...

600
00:47:42,473 --> 00:47:44,464
ready to take.

601
00:47:44,542 --> 00:47:47,477
Why, with a hammer and saw,
I could build a city.

602
00:47:47,545 --> 00:47:51,345
What you could do with tools.
Are you gonna let me starve?

603
00:47:51,415 --> 00:47:54,248
Say, if you wanna eat,
you gotta work...

604
00:47:54,318 --> 00:47:56,980
just like the rest of us.

605
00:47:58,622 --> 00:48:00,886
Papa spank.

606
00:48:40,731 --> 00:48:42,722
Thank you.

607
00:49:02,186 --> 00:49:05,155
That's just the same
as stealing.

608
00:49:05,222 --> 00:49:09,158
Oh, I ought to slap your face. If
it would make you feel any better.

609
00:49:24,008 --> 00:49:26,943
Gracie, what's the
matter? I can't sleep.

610
00:49:27,011 --> 00:49:30,845
Why don't you try counting
sheep? Shh! I did. Look.

611
00:49:33,684 --> 00:49:38,018
News flash: The oil tanker
Good Hope reports by radio...

612
00:49:38,088 --> 00:49:40,784
they have rescued the crew
of the palatial yacht Doris,

613
00:49:40,858 --> 00:49:44,294
which was owned by Miss Doris Worthington,
heiress of the Worthington millions.

614
00:49:44,361 --> 00:49:46,955
The owner and her party
are believed lost.

615
00:49:47,031 --> 00:49:50,626
Did you hear that? Isn't that
awful? I should say that is.

616
00:49:50,701 --> 00:49:54,364
Sure. They woke up my sheep.

617
00:49:54,438 --> 00:49:58,704
Gracie, why don't
you go to sleep?

618
00:49:58,776 --> 00:50:04,146
I can't go to sleep. I've got insomnia. George,
frighten me, and that will cure my insomnia.

619
00:50:04,214 --> 00:50:06,409
All right,
I'll frighten ya.

620
00:50:06,483 --> 00:50:09,816
Close your eyes and count from
one to 20, and I'll frighten ya.

621
00:50:09,887 --> 00:50:12,879
Yeah, all right.
Now no peekin'.

622
00:50:12,956 --> 00:50:17,325
1, 2, 3, 5, 4, 5,

623
00:50:17,394 --> 00:50:19,828
6, 7, 14,

624
00:50:19,897 --> 00:50:24,357
15, 16, 17,

625
00:50:24,435 --> 00:50:26,403
B-19, 20!

626
00:50:26,470 --> 00:50:29,337
Here I come!
Ready or not! Here-Aw!

627
00:50:32,676 --> 00:50:36,077
George! George!

628
00:50:37,414 --> 00:50:41,180
George?
George, where are you?

629
00:50:46,623 --> 00:50:50,616
That's a good disguise, George, but
it doesn't frighten me. Try again.

630
00:50:50,694 --> 00:50:53,925
1, 2, 3, 4, 5,

631
00:50:53,997 --> 00:50:56,795
6, 7, 8, 9, 10.

632
00:50:56,867 --> 00:50:59,028
Ready or not,
here I come.

633
00:50:59,103 --> 00:51:03,472
Here I- George?
Georgie Porgie?

634
00:51:05,075 --> 00:51:07,100
George.!

635
00:51:07,177 --> 00:51:09,941
Georgie!

636
00:51:12,850 --> 00:51:15,045
Ye-

637
00:51:15,119 --> 00:51:19,112
Oh, that's much better, George, but
your baby-blue eyes gave you away.

638
00:51:19,189 --> 00:51:23,683
I don't know, but I think you look better
in that than you do in your street clothes.

639
00:51:23,761 --> 00:51:26,696
I'm getting tired.

640
00:51:26,764 --> 00:51:31,394
Let's stop playing and carry me
home piggyback. Whee! Here I go!

641
00:51:31,468 --> 00:51:33,766
Now, George,
not too fast.

642
00:51:33,837 --> 00:51:38,171
Oh, George! You know
bears can't climb trees!

643
00:51:40,677 --> 00:51:44,204
Now George Martin, take me
down this instant. Gracie!

644
00:51:44,281 --> 00:51:46,476
Who are you?

645
00:51:46,550 --> 00:51:48,711
Who am I?

646
00:51:48,786 --> 00:51:51,584
If this is you up here,
then who are you down there?

647
00:51:51,655 --> 00:51:55,421
Gracie, this is me. That's a
real bear up there. Come on down.

648
00:51:55,492 --> 00:51:57,460
Yeooooowwww!

649
00:51:57,528 --> 00:51:59,655
Come on, Gracie!

650
00:52:07,471 --> 00:52:09,701
May [

651
00:52:09,773 --> 00:52:14,369
Be the only one
to say [

652
00:52:14,445 --> 00:52:19,109
Really fell in love
the day [

653
00:52:19,183 --> 00:52:22,675
First set eyes
on you

654
00:52:25,889 --> 00:52:28,551
May I

655
00:52:28,625 --> 00:52:32,083
With your
very kind permissión

656
00:52:32,162 --> 00:52:36,599
Tell you that
my one ambition

657
00:52:36,667 --> 00:52:45,006
Is to share
a love affair with you

658
00:52:45,075 --> 00:52:48,442
Here I wait

659
00:52:48,512 --> 00:52:51,811
Do give me
my chance

660
00:52:51,882 --> 00:52:54,180
Do tell me my fate

661
00:52:55,819 --> 00:52:59,721
What is your answer

662
00:53:01,458 --> 00:53:04,120
May [

663
00:53:04,194 --> 00:53:08,221
Hold you to my heart
and pray [

664
00:53:08,298 --> 00:53:13,463
Will be there beside you
when they groom and bride you

665
00:53:13,537 --> 00:53:16,199
May I hear you say

666
00:53:16,273 --> 00:53:19,572
I do

667
00:53:28,652 --> 00:53:30,984
Gracie, my gun! A bird! What?

668
00:53:31,054 --> 00:53:34,546
A bird! A bird! All right,
wait a minute.! Here.

669
00:53:37,661 --> 00:53:41,028
Not a duck. My gun! How
could you shoot with a duck?

670
00:53:41,098 --> 00:53:45,057
Well, my father used to shoot ducks,
but maybe that duck wasn't loaded.

671
00:53:45,135 --> 00:53:48,764
I'd like to bet that your father
was. If he was, then why did...

672
00:53:48,839 --> 00:53:52,536
the duck shoot my father because I always say
- Quiet! Quiet!

673
00:53:52,609 --> 00:53:57,069
Well, I missed him. He's gone, and that was
a stratosphere duck, and they're very rare.

674
00:53:57,147 --> 00:54:01,607
I'm glad you missed him. I don't like
rare duck. I like my ducks well-done.

675
00:54:01,685 --> 00:54:04,245
Now take my uncle.
You take your uncle.

676
00:54:04,321 --> 00:54:06,255
They did.
They did?

677
00:54:06,323 --> 00:54:09,258
My uncle's a hunter. Well,
I'd rather not hear about it.

678
00:54:09,326 --> 00:54:12,261
My uncle always goes
out duck hunting.

679
00:54:12,329 --> 00:54:15,856
Now Monday he takes four dogs,
and Tuesday he takes three dogs.

680
00:54:15,933 --> 00:54:20,267
Gracie, Gracie, why does he take four
dogs Monday and three dogs Tuesday?

681
00:54:20,337 --> 00:54:23,465
Because that other dog won't
follow him on Tuesday. Why?

682
00:54:23,540 --> 00:54:26,065
Because
he shot him Monday.

683
00:54:26,143 --> 00:54:29,670
Nice work. He aims at little
innocent birds and shoots dogs.

684
00:54:29,746 --> 00:54:32,909
Yeah, all except one dog. His
favorite dog. His name is Scram.

685
00:54:32,983 --> 00:54:37,750
Your uncle's name is Scram? Oh,
stop. No, the dog's name is Scram.

686
00:54:37,821 --> 00:54:41,587
You see, that saves my uncle a
lot of money calling him Scram.

687
00:54:41,658 --> 00:54:45,594
Because the dog's name is Scram,
that saves your uncle a lot of money?

688
00:54:45,662 --> 00:54:49,655
Sure. When he calls the dog to feed
him, he hollers, ''Scram! Scram!''

689
00:54:49,733 --> 00:54:52,998
And the dog runs away. I get the
whole thing. And the dog runs away.

690
00:54:53,070 --> 00:54:56,562
I mean, the whole-

691
00:54:56,640 --> 00:55:00,098
Gracie, the stratosphere
duck! My gun!

692
00:55:00,177 --> 00:55:03,271
George, hit him! Hit
him hard! Hit him hard!

693
00:55:03,347 --> 00:55:05,338
Gracie! Gracie!

694
00:55:06,917 --> 00:55:10,353
I missed him.
I missed him!

695
00:55:10,420 --> 00:55:14,754
George, you missed him with your gun,
but you didn't miss him with your head.

696
00:55:14,825 --> 00:55:19,228
I think you shoot straighter with your
head than with your gun. You think so?

697
00:55:19,296 --> 00:55:23,665
I think so. Let me tell ya
somethin'. There is nothing up here.

698
00:55:23,734 --> 00:55:27,397
Yeah, I know.

699
00:55:27,471 --> 00:55:30,702
What was that? The moose trap.
Something's caught in my moose trap.

700
00:55:30,774 --> 00:55:33,834
Moose trap.

701
00:55:43,787 --> 00:55:47,314
Me know you.

702
00:55:47,391 --> 00:55:51,157
Gracie, what's the matter?
We just caught Tarzan's mate.

703
00:55:51,228 --> 00:55:54,288
Tarzan is a character in a
book. Well, maybe he got out.

704
00:55:54,364 --> 00:55:57,891
Would you mind helping me
out of this hole?

705
00:55:57,968 --> 00:56:00,061
Well, who are you?

706
00:56:00,137 --> 00:56:03,334
Where did you
come from?

707
00:56:03,407 --> 00:56:08,470
We were shipwrecked on the other
side of the island. Do you live here?

708
00:56:08,545 --> 00:56:12,413
Well, temporarily. We're Mr. and
Mrs. George Martin. Naturalists.

709
00:56:12,482 --> 00:56:15,007
Our camp-
I'm Miss Doris Worthington.

710
00:56:15,085 --> 00:56:18,145
Oh. Oh, Gracie, this
is the missing heiress.

711
00:56:18,221 --> 00:56:22,055
Hello. Maybe she knows where my missing brother
is. Do you know where my missing brother-

712
00:56:22,125 --> 00:56:26,084
Gracie. Instead of shooting a bird,
I should have shot a little idiot.

713
00:56:26,163 --> 00:56:30,293
If you gotta shoot an idiot, shoot a big
one. We're gonna have company for dinner.

714
00:56:30,367 --> 00:56:33,393
We heard about your
shipwreck on the radio.

715
00:56:33,470 --> 00:56:36,598
Ships are searching all the
islands for you. Oh, how nice.

716
00:56:36,673 --> 00:56:40,939
Our boat is coming next month. In the meantime,
we could make you comfortable at our camp.

717
00:56:41,011 --> 00:56:46,176
Thank you. But for the present,
could you just lend us some clothes?

718
00:56:46,249 --> 00:56:48,877
Oh, certainly.
Why, certainly.

719
00:56:48,952 --> 00:56:51,819
And a kit of tools?
Tools?

720
00:56:51,888 --> 00:56:54,789
Yes, a tool kit,
if you'll be so kind.

721
00:57:30,761 --> 00:57:33,525
Playing boats?

722
00:57:33,597 --> 00:57:36,191
Tools! This is luck!

723
00:57:36,266 --> 00:57:40,134
A gift from heaven. Now you can build
that city you were talking about.

724
00:57:40,203 --> 00:57:44,162
This feels like a blanket. That's to
sleep on after you've built your city.

725
00:57:44,241 --> 00:57:49,372
Clothes! Ohh! Now where do
you suppose they came from?

726
00:57:49,446 --> 00:57:52,882
Maybe they
were washed ashore.

727
00:57:52,949 --> 00:57:55,645
Here.
Carry some of these.

728
00:58:01,591 --> 00:58:03,650
Come on.

729
00:58:03,727 --> 00:58:07,754
Well, sir, it's a good thing somebody
around here keeps his eyes open.

730
00:58:07,831 --> 00:58:11,858
Sailor, I don't know how we'd
ever get along without you.

731
00:58:42,199 --> 00:58:46,135
Hey, look, Robinson Crusoe. Why do
we have to do everything in one day?

732
00:58:46,203 --> 00:58:50,037
Is our lease up tonight? Oh, stop
crabbin'. The work is good for your liver.

733
00:58:50,106 --> 00:58:52,734
My liver never did
anything for me.

734
00:58:52,809 --> 00:58:55,642
Anyhow you'll all
sleep well tonight.

735
00:58:55,712 --> 00:58:58,704
See, a little work
won't hurt you... for once.

736
00:58:58,782 --> 00:59:02,650
Oh, I don't mind work now and then.
But I don't want it to become a habit.

737
00:59:02,719 --> 00:59:06,621
Don't say that, Uncle Hubert. He
worked harder himself than any of us.

738
00:59:06,690 --> 00:59:10,217
He certainly did.
Why, we've only begun to work.

739
00:59:10,293 --> 00:59:13,091
Tomorrow we'll get
an early start, about 6:00.

740
00:59:13,163 --> 00:59:16,132
What? And waste
the whole morning?

741
00:59:16,199 --> 00:59:19,999
Stop grumbling. The least you
can do is obey orders cheerfully.

742
00:59:20,070 --> 00:59:23,665
Without the sailor to lead us,
where would we be now? Asleep.

743
00:59:23,740 --> 00:59:27,574
We'd probably be dead of starvation
and exposure. Oh, now don't exaggerate.

744
00:59:32,682 --> 00:59:36,778
I'm gonna hit the hay.
Call me October 8.

745
00:59:36,853 --> 00:59:40,619
How can you think of sleep
on a night like this?

746
00:59:40,690 --> 00:59:44,421
Smell the breeze. It's perfume.
Smell it yourself. It's your idea.

747
00:59:44,494 --> 00:59:47,725
Aw, let's go out in the
jungle and pick some orchids.

748
00:59:47,797 --> 00:59:50,789
No, I'm tired. Let 'em
come out here and pick us.

749
01:00:00,543 --> 01:00:03,478
Now you draw two hearts
with an arrow joining them.

750
01:00:03,546 --> 01:00:07,312
Then you put the initials inside
the hearts. Oh, I didn't see you.

751
01:00:07,384 --> 01:00:11,582
That's what annoyed me. I'm just
trying to figure out a simple method...

752
01:00:11,655 --> 01:00:14,715
of bringing fresh water
into the camp. See-

753
01:00:14,791 --> 01:00:18,784
Sailor, look at the moon.

754
01:00:18,862 --> 01:00:21,194
Now look at me.

755
01:00:21,264 --> 01:00:24,427
Now tell me
what you're thinking about.

756
01:00:24,501 --> 01:00:27,595
Uh, this, uh-
this diagram. I-

757
01:00:27,671 --> 01:00:32,699
Sailors aren't what they used to be.
No, sir. Gimme the good old sailors.

758
01:00:32,776 --> 01:00:35,677
If I could get this
figured out tonight,

759
01:00:35,745 --> 01:00:38,680
I think we could have it in
operation in three or four days.

760
01:00:38,748 --> 01:00:42,650
How long do you expect to be here?
Well, your guess is as good as mine.

761
01:00:42,719 --> 01:00:46,246
Maybe better. You know you're
just like that butler in the play,

762
01:00:46,323 --> 01:00:49,224
the one that was marooned
with his lady?

763
01:00:49,292 --> 01:00:51,692
What was his name?
Crichton, isn't it?

764
01:00:51,761 --> 01:00:54,559
Crichton. That's right.
The Admirable Crichton.

765
01:00:54,631 --> 01:00:57,600
Only he was dressed in skins,
showing his chest.

766
01:00:57,667 --> 01:01:00,568
Am I gonna get to see
your chest, sailor?

767
01:01:00,637 --> 01:01:03,572
Everything's funny
to you, isn't it?

768
01:01:03,640 --> 01:01:06,666
The lady fell in love with
him. I remember that part.

769
01:01:06,743 --> 01:01:10,611
But it didn't turn out very
happily. He had to give her up.

770
01:01:10,680 --> 01:01:13,979
[ remember that part. It must
have been fun while it lasted.

771
01:01:14,050 --> 01:01:16,814
Oh, she was
a selfish little prig.

772
01:01:16,886 --> 01:01:19,753
How could he fall in love
with a selfish little prig?

773
01:01:19,823 --> 01:01:23,657
I did.
Who is she?

774
01:01:23,727 --> 01:01:27,959
Wouldn't it be better if you ran along
and let me figure out the water supply?

775
01:01:28,031 --> 01:01:31,489
No. It's after
working hours.

776
01:01:31,568 --> 01:01:34,731
Who is the little pig you
fell in love with? Prig.

777
01:01:34,804 --> 01:01:37,238
Who is she?
You.

778
01:01:38,942 --> 01:01:42,742
I fell in love with you the day
you walked up that gangplank.

779
01:01:42,812 --> 01:01:46,339
You kept it pretty quiet. What's
the matter with me, too much money?

780
01:01:46,416 --> 01:01:50,352
No. Nobody has too
much money. What then?

781
01:01:51,921 --> 01:01:54,719
Don't you think you
better... go to bed?

782
01:01:54,791 --> 01:01:58,022
Look, sailor. Why didn't you
tell me you're in love with me?

783
01:01:58,094 --> 01:02:01,325
A man hasn't a right to keep
a thing like that to himself.

784
01:02:01,398 --> 01:02:03,832
I didn't want to.
Why not?

785
01:02:03,900 --> 01:02:06,767
Because I have a fairly
clear idea about my life-

786
01:02:06,836 --> 01:02:10,772
what I want and what
I have to do. Such as?

787
01:02:10,840 --> 01:02:14,799
When we get off this island, I'd like to
continue around the worid. I'm an architect.

788
01:02:16,513 --> 01:02:19,448
At least, that's what
they told me at college.

789
01:02:19,516 --> 01:02:22,383
I've been offered
a job in New York.

790
01:02:22,452 --> 01:02:24,920
Is that so important?

791
01:02:24,988 --> 01:02:29,015
No, but it's better than
letting a wife support you.

792
01:02:29,092 --> 01:02:31,526
You mean that, sailor?

793
01:02:31,594 --> 01:02:34,529
I wish I didn't.

794
01:02:37,167 --> 01:02:40,261
I never thought
about it that way before.

795
01:02:40,336 --> 01:02:45,865
But, you see, it hurts because I saw
you too when I came up the gangplank.

796
01:02:45,942 --> 01:02:49,742
You had a smudge of grease
on your nose.

797
01:02:49,813 --> 01:02:54,113
Well... what are
we gonna do about it?

798
01:02:54,184 --> 01:02:58,985
Nothing. Then why are
you making love to me?

799
01:02:59,055 --> 01:03:03,151
I'm not making love to
you. Yes, you are, sailor.

800
01:03:03,226 --> 01:03:06,457
Really, you are.
And I want you to,

801
01:03:06,529 --> 01:03:09,327
though I don't know why.

802
01:03:24,914 --> 01:03:30,216
Once in a blue moon

803
01:03:30,286 --> 01:03:35,155
Someone like you
happens along

804
01:03:35,225 --> 01:03:39,127
Out of a clear blue sky

805
01:03:39,195 --> 01:03:43,655
Here are you
Here am I

806
01:03:43,733 --> 01:03:49,365
Once in a blue moon

807
01:03:49,439 --> 01:03:54,138
Life will become
a beautiful song

808
01:03:54,210 --> 01:03:58,476
Though we were
worids apart

809
01:03:58,548 --> 01:04:03,315
Here we are
heart to heart

810
01:04:03,386 --> 01:04:07,482
Souls

811
01:04:07,557 --> 01:04:12,620
That used to be
strange souls

812
01:04:12,695 --> 01:04:15,789
Now are sharing

813
01:04:15,865 --> 01:04:20,825
A dream so divine

814
01:04:22,705 --> 01:04:25,970
Lips

815
01:04:26,042 --> 01:04:29,773
That used to be
strange lips

816
01:04:31,614 --> 01:04:34,014
Are declaring

817
01:04:34,083 --> 01:04:36,677
I love you

818
01:04:36,753 --> 01:04:39,916
Will you be mine

819
01:04:39,989 --> 01:04:43,288
Say you'll be mine

820
01:04:44,994 --> 01:04:50,762
Once in a blue moon

821
01:04:50,833 --> 01:04:55,896
Someone like you
happens along

822
01:04:55,972 --> 01:04:58,406
A blessing from heaven

823
01:04:58,474 --> 01:05:02,934
Above

824
01:05:03,012 --> 01:05:05,674
Here are you

825
01:05:05,748 --> 01:05:08,911
Here am I

826
01:05:08,985 --> 01:05:11,886
This is love

827
01:05:11,955 --> 01:05:15,049
Miss Worthington.!
Miss Worthington.!

828
01:05:15,124 --> 01:05:18,958
Miss Worthington! Do you know
where Miss Worthington is?

829
01:05:19,028 --> 01:05:21,622
This is
Miss Worthington herself.

830
01:05:21,698 --> 01:05:25,566
[ came to tell you that you're
rescued, and the captain's-

831
01:05:25,635 --> 01:05:30,231
Two boats arrived searching for you
over in the cove by our camp now.

832
01:05:30,306 --> 01:05:33,469
We thought we'd better come fetch
you. You could spend the night...

833
01:05:33,543 --> 01:05:37,741
at our camp and be ready for an early
start. George would like his tools.

834
01:05:37,814 --> 01:05:40,715
Come on.
Well, no, wait a minute.

835
01:05:40,783 --> 01:05:45,186
[ mean, the tools and the clothes that
we leant her to play thatjoke on somebody.

836
01:05:45,255 --> 01:05:48,884
Yes, thank you.
You can take the rest across.

837
01:05:48,958 --> 01:05:51,791
We'll follow in a few minutes. Come on.

838
01:05:51,861 --> 01:05:54,227
Ye- Oh, oh.

839
01:05:59,636 --> 01:06:02,400
Don't be angry.
Please.

840
01:06:02,472 --> 01:06:06,431
Why don't you go? You've had
your fun. Don't take it like that.

841
01:06:06,509 --> 01:06:10,707
Go on back to your friends. A lot
of people laughing makes it funnier.

842
01:06:10,780 --> 01:06:13,647
Stephen- You can tell
them the rest of it-

843
01:06:13,716 --> 01:06:17,880
how I made love to you and told you
my life's history and everything.

844
01:06:17,954 --> 01:06:20,718
They'll die laughing.
I kissed you.

845
01:06:20,790 --> 01:06:24,317
Now that meant a lot to
you, didn't it? Doris.!

846
01:06:24,394 --> 01:06:27,921
Oh, Doris!
Here [ am, Michael.!

847
01:06:27,997 --> 01:06:31,433
- You gave us an awful scare, Doris.
- We thought you got lost.

848
01:06:31,501 --> 01:06:33,594
She's not alone.

849
01:06:33,670 --> 01:06:36,400
Well, practically
alone. Come along, Doris.

850
01:06:36,472 --> 01:06:40,238
The others started over long
ago. Miss Worthington isn't going.

851
01:06:40,310 --> 01:06:43,245
She's staying here.
What's he talking about?

852
01:06:43,313 --> 01:06:46,305
Thank heaven we don't have to
take any more of his insolence.

853
01:06:46,382 --> 01:06:50,318
Come along, Doris. On your way,
before I break both your necks.

854
01:06:50,386 --> 01:06:54,618
See here. The man's crazy. I've been
wanting to do this for a long time.

855
01:06:56,859 --> 01:07:00,124
That was a very stupid
thing to do.

856
01:07:00,196 --> 01:07:04,462
Why? Can't we all play games?
I like to play rough.

857
01:07:05,868 --> 01:07:09,702
Will you tell me what on Earth
- You'll find out.

858
01:07:11,607 --> 01:07:14,576
I suppose a fate
worse than death awaits me.

859
01:07:14,644 --> 01:07:17,875
How do you know it's worse than death?
You never been dead, have ya?

860
01:07:20,850 --> 01:07:23,250
Let me go!
I will not!

861
01:07:44,240 --> 01:07:48,074
Let me outta here! This is
not exactly a perfumed boudoir,

862
01:07:48,144 --> 01:07:51,477
but after all, Adam and Eve got
along all right. You wouldn't dare!

863
01:07:51,547 --> 01:07:55,244
Why wouldn't I? Tomorrow you'll
be back in your own worid...

864
01:07:55,318 --> 01:07:58,287
spoiled and petted and
sheltered and out of my reach.

865
01:07:58,354 --> 01:08:01,289
In all my life, I'll probably
never see you again.

866
01:08:01,357 --> 01:08:05,020
But tonight you're mine,
just as you pretended to be.

867
01:08:11,134 --> 01:08:14,797
Remember this, will you?
And remember it always.

868
01:08:14,871 --> 01:08:19,308
Remember there was a man you led on
and laughed at. A man who could have-

869
01:08:19,375 --> 01:08:21,366
Well, he didn't...

870
01:08:21,444 --> 01:08:25,107
because you're
not worth it.

871
01:08:40,363 --> 01:08:42,388
Doris. Are you all right?

872
01:08:42,465 --> 01:08:45,332
Are we in time?
Yes, you're in time.

873
01:09:06,756 --> 01:09:10,988
Doris, I feel you ought to know that it
was Michael who gave you his life preserver.

874
01:09:11,060 --> 01:09:14,996
Alexander, you shouldn't have
told her. I asked you not to.

875
01:09:15,064 --> 01:09:18,227
Michael is so modest. It was
very nice of you, Michael.

876
01:09:18,301 --> 01:09:21,293
I'll see that you get a
Carnegie medal or something.

877
01:09:21,370 --> 01:09:23,998
Ready,
Miss Worthington.

878
01:09:34,217 --> 01:09:38,119
You know
- Gracie, do you miss these people so much?

879
01:09:38,187 --> 01:09:42,146
No, they don't mean anything in
my life. Then why are you crying?

880
01:09:42,225 --> 01:09:45,194
Oh, this thing keeps
pinchin' my stomach.

881
01:10:01,177 --> 01:10:05,807
Mr., Mrs., Mrs., Mrs.,
Mrs., Mrs., Miss.

882
01:10:05,882 --> 01:10:08,214
Say, look at this.

883
01:10:08,284 --> 01:10:12,380
''Miss Lucille Van Epps O'Rourk,
Park Avenue, New York.''

884
01:10:12,455 --> 01:10:14,548
Mike!
Alex!

885
01:10:31,774 --> 01:10:35,175
If you're drinking scotch-a
and feeling quite reckless

886
01:10:35,244 --> 01:10:38,805
And some sweet muchacha
says ''buy me a necklace''

887
01:10:38,881 --> 01:10:43,375
It's just an old
Spanish custom

888
01:10:43,452 --> 01:10:48,719
Ah, my Adonis,
so handsome, so fair.

889
01:10:48,791 --> 01:10:52,386
Smoke gets in your eyes,
but you gets in my hair.

890
01:10:54,597 --> 01:10:58,590
Go to your royal princes.
We're finished. We're through.

891
01:10:58,668 --> 01:11:01,102
Princes now
are quite taboo

892
01:11:01,170 --> 01:11:03,161
All I crave is Y-O-U

893
01:11:03,239 --> 01:11:07,198
Can't you see, woof-woof
It's the animal in me

894
01:11:27,997 --> 01:11:31,524
Skipper wants to see
you on the bridge. Right.

895
01:11:46,015 --> 01:11:48,609
- I changed ships.
- Why?

896
01:11:48,684 --> 01:11:52,313
On account of Droopy.
She needs a father.

897
01:11:52,388 --> 01:11:55,380
Now what did
you come here for?

898
01:11:55,458 --> 01:11:58,825
For better, for worse,
for richer, for poorer.

899
01:11:58,894 --> 01:12:02,352
No, really, Stephen. I want
to study architecture too.

900
01:12:02,431 --> 01:12:05,366
Haven't you had
enough fun with me?

901
