1
00:00:30,266 --> 00:00:32,368
There was once a Colonel
in the Army

2
00:00:32,433 --> 00:00:35,602
Yes, he is that colonel.

3
00:00:35,933 --> 00:00:39,670
But that was the time, when
the British were ruling India

4
00:00:40,033 --> 00:00:43,503
When the British left, The
Colonel left the army...

5
00:00:43,666 --> 00:00:45,000
... but did not leave his
military discipline

6
00:00:45,133 --> 00:00:48,169
People call him now
as Rai Saheb

7
00:00:48,233 --> 00:00:53,104
He lives in a very big
bungalow with his grandchildren

8
00:00:53,299 --> 00:01:00,173
He had a son named Nilesh.

9
00:01:00,433 --> 00:01:03,169
He was iust as stubborn as
his father.

10
00:01:03,333 --> 00:01:05,568
But his likes were very different
from Rai Saheb.

11
00:01:05,866 --> 00:01:07,200
He wanted to be a musician but
Rai Saheb did'nt want this.

12
00:01:07,333 --> 00:01:09,001
He married as per his wish to
Sujata without Raisaheb's consent

13
00:01:09,166 --> 00:01:11,468
Then events which have been
happening for years only...

14
00:01:11,666 --> 00:01:15,469
...happened. Nilesh and Suiata
lived a life of poverty...

15
00:01:15,933 --> 00:01:20,570
...and both of them died
fighting with their poor life

16
00:01:20,966 --> 00:01:22,867
...and left their five children as
orphans without any support

17
00:01:23,000 --> 00:01:28,338
Rama, Aiay, Viiay, Meeta
and Sanju

18
00:01:30,400 --> 00:01:33,870
After 17 years, Rai Saheb
brought back Nilesh's children...

19
00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:35,935
...to the bungalow and tried
a lot to educate them.

20
00:01:36,299 --> 00:01:38,602
But these children also turned
out to be as stubborn as...

21
00:01:38,900 --> 00:01:41,035
...their father and grandfather.

22
00:01:41,566 --> 00:01:46,003
He kept many masters but they
did'nt allow anyone to stay.

23
00:01:46,166 --> 00:01:48,902
Some stayed for months, some
for weeks & some only 10 days

24
00:01:49,099 --> 00:01:52,203
Some left after being fed up
and some...

25
00:01:52,400 --> 00:01:55,536
No, he has not gone and he is
still teaching this children

26
00:02:00,099 --> 00:02:04,070
Silence...-We are silent
and you are only talking

27
00:02:04,299 --> 00:02:07,670
Again you talked back...
Stand up...

28
00:02:10,366 --> 00:02:12,301
What did l do that
you are beating me?

29
00:02:12,433 --> 00:02:17,204
Till now you have not done
anything & this is Ur condition

30
00:02:17,333 --> 00:02:20,436
Think of what your condition
will be, if you do something

31
00:02:20,566 --> 00:02:25,604
l have heard a lot about you and
if l don't set all of you right...

32
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:29,403
...then you tell me, ok...
Stand up - l'm standing

33
00:02:29,566 --> 00:02:32,201
Keep standing.
Stand up on the chair.

34
00:02:36,266 --> 00:02:38,234
Learn the lesson in geography.

35
00:02:38,533 --> 00:02:41,903
Till then l will teach your
little brother. You understood!

36
00:02:45,433 --> 00:02:50,337
J for Jack and K for...
-l need to do it.

37
00:02:50,466 --> 00:02:58,340
Do what?
-Masterji, l need to do it.

38
00:02:58,633 --> 00:03:04,138
But do what?
-l have to do it

39
00:03:04,433 --> 00:03:10,438
What do you have to do?
-Have to do it?- But what?

40
00:03:10,599 --> 00:03:14,003
l have done it.
-What? you've done it.

41
00:03:18,300 --> 00:03:20,602
Then you are a good student

42
00:03:54,866 --> 00:03:57,868
Sleep, No one is there.
Sleep...

43
00:04:40,633 --> 00:04:48,140
No...
Ghost! Ghost!

44
00:05:12,333 --> 00:05:13,901
What happened to masterii?
-l don't know, sir

45
00:05:14,399 --> 00:05:17,603
He ran saying that there
was a ghost.- See this, brother

46
00:05:19,933 --> 00:05:21,000
Who has done this?

47
00:05:24,100 --> 00:05:26,469
Whose prank is this?
-Who else can it be?

48
00:05:27,000 --> 00:05:30,103
Only those for whom teachers
are appointed every day.

49
00:05:30,300 --> 00:05:34,637
ls it something new brother?
-Go, Call all of them outside.

50
00:05:44,233 --> 00:05:47,002
Aiay....
Vijay....

51
00:05:47,433 --> 00:05:52,037
Meeta.
Sanju....

52
00:05:52,233 --> 00:05:58,172
You don't have to put on an act.
Rai Saheb is calling you all.

53
00:05:58,500 --> 00:06:01,369
You won't get up like this.

54
00:06:01,933 --> 00:06:03,668
Come on, all of you get up.

55
00:06:04,333 --> 00:06:08,070
Come on get up..
All of you...

56
00:06:12,500 --> 00:06:14,368
Sister....Sister....

57
00:06:20,199 --> 00:06:22,535
Rai Saheb is calling you.
Come soon.

58
00:06:22,666 --> 00:06:25,268
l don't understand why you are
behind them.

59
00:06:25,466 --> 00:06:28,869
You are also not less
stubborn, brother

60
00:06:29,000 --> 00:06:30,901
Let them not study
if they don't want to.

61
00:06:32,300 --> 00:06:35,636
You go and sleep, brother.
l will see to them.

62
00:06:49,333 --> 00:06:50,233
Come soon

63
00:06:51,233 --> 00:06:51,933
Stand here.

64
00:06:55,233 --> 00:06:55,866
Where is Rama?

65
00:06:56,366 --> 00:07:00,303
You also come here.

66
00:07:05,300 --> 00:07:10,571
You are the real captain. Can
anything happen without Ur wish

67
00:07:15,199 --> 00:07:17,902
Tell the truth as to who did it.
Who lit the candle on the...

68
00:07:18,133 --> 00:07:21,603
...Tortoise's back?

69
00:07:25,266 --> 00:07:29,370
Answer clearly as to whose
prank is this or...

70
00:07:29,500 --> 00:07:31,034
...l will make you all stand here
for the whole night.

71
00:07:34,433 --> 00:07:39,371
Won't you tell then?
Then keep standing like this

72
00:07:40,666 --> 00:07:43,001
Narain, you also stand here and
see that none of them...

73
00:07:43,166 --> 00:07:46,269
...even try to sit down.
-Ok

74
00:07:46,500 --> 00:07:50,270
But for the whole night -Yes,
they'll stand the whole night

75
00:07:50,500 --> 00:07:53,002
And me also
-Yes, you also will stand

76
00:07:54,633 --> 00:07:57,635
The army has done the mischief
but the drum-beaters...

77
00:07:57,933 --> 00:07:59,000
...get the punishment

78
00:09:53,433 --> 00:09:57,370
There is Saturn's influence on
Monday and hence work is not...

79
00:09:57,500 --> 00:10:00,903
...being done. Then there is
Budh...-Wait, Panditji

80
00:10:01,033 --> 00:10:05,537
You have said the whole week
upside down.

81
00:10:06,000 --> 00:10:09,236
Why don't U start from Monday
-You leave this joking...

82
00:10:09,333 --> 00:10:11,868
...attitude and listen to
the Panditji.

83
00:10:12,500 --> 00:10:18,372
You say in plain Hindi as to
whether he'll get a job or not

84
00:10:18,433 --> 00:10:23,004
Listen youth, l don't like this
joke with palmistry

85
00:10:23,066 --> 00:10:28,037
l am stuck now. He will say the
full horoscope and then only go

86
00:10:29,299 --> 00:10:33,270
What are you thinking? -l was
listening to the second track

87
00:10:33,399 --> 00:10:37,003
What is that?
-Don't you know?

88
00:10:37,466 --> 00:10:40,435
When someone is speaking, there
is also one voice speaking...

89
00:10:40,500 --> 00:10:43,903
...inside you. l call that
as my second track.

90
00:10:44,133 --> 00:10:46,435
The only difference is that my
second track speaks lowder...

91
00:10:46,500 --> 00:10:51,938
...than me -ls it? Then what is
your second track saying now.

92
00:10:52,033 --> 00:10:55,069
lt says that l won't get this iob
-Why not?

93
00:10:55,466 --> 00:10:57,067
The reason is that Panditii won't
Ieave my hand. So l won't...

94
00:10:57,133 --> 00:10:58,934
...be able to go to the interview
and hence l won't get the job.

95
00:10:59,000 --> 00:11:02,570
Job is not in your fate as the
lines of your hand indicate...

96
00:11:02,966 --> 00:11:07,303
...that you will do business.
Your fortune is going to change

97
00:11:07,366 --> 00:11:10,602
When it does, you will
get a royal place

98
00:11:11,133 --> 00:11:14,436
Maharai, l don't get a iob for
150-200 Rs. salary here & you...

99
00:11:14,500 --> 00:11:18,003
...are talking of royal kingdom.
You see Amit's hands. l'll go

100
00:11:18,066 --> 00:11:20,601
Ok, see my hand, Panditii

101
00:11:24,166 --> 00:11:25,534
l don't know English and l need
a person who'll write whatever...

102
00:11:25,600 --> 00:11:35,576
...l say in Hindi in English-Yes
-U should write only what l say

103
00:11:35,899 --> 00:11:42,406
The one who used to work for
us has become very old-Yes,sir

104
00:11:42,533 --> 00:11:48,672
Now he has become an old man
-Yes, sir.

105
00:11:48,966 --> 00:11:51,068
He is not able to see properly
also.

106
00:11:51,266 --> 00:11:55,269
One letter has to be typed
ten times.-Yes sir

107
00:11:55,500 --> 00:11:57,568
Work is not more than
24 hrs.

108
00:11:57,866 --> 00:12:02,136
Everyday there will be 10-12
Ietters and once in a month..

109
00:12:02,200 --> 00:12:03,968
...you have to type all the bills
and send it. - Yes sir

110
00:12:04,033 --> 00:12:07,669
Have you understood?
-Yes sir...-Pirachandji

111
00:12:10,433 --> 00:12:13,269
Pirachandii, take him inside and
explain all the work to him

112
00:12:14,233 --> 00:12:15,634
You go with him
-Yes sir

113
00:12:24,000 --> 00:12:25,267
Sit ...

114
00:12:38,600 --> 00:12:39,968
Do you take Beedi?
-No, sir

115
00:12:44,299 --> 00:12:48,604
l keep the letters which come
everyday in the left tray.

116
00:12:49,233 --> 00:12:52,336
The ones for which reply need
not be given, l keep them...

117
00:12:52,433 --> 00:12:54,334
...in this right tray.

118
00:12:57,666 --> 00:12:59,968
Nothing else but the work
becomes systematic

119
00:13:02,033 --> 00:13:08,139
The ones which've to be replied,
keep their copies in those...

120
00:13:08,200 --> 00:13:11,136
...files there. There is a
separate file for every year

121
00:13:12,033 --> 00:13:16,070
l have kept them properly
& you won't have any problem

122
00:13:16,266 --> 00:13:22,138
l got this almirah made as per
my order and Sethji did...

123
00:13:22,200 --> 00:13:25,636
...not say anything at all.
He is a very nice person

124
00:13:26,033 --> 00:13:28,402
He has really taken very
good care of me

125
00:13:29,266 --> 00:13:32,936
How long have you been
working here?

126
00:13:33,000 --> 00:13:40,407
Last month, l have completed
22 yrs working here.

127
00:13:42,000 --> 00:13:45,937
Whatever l required, l
immediately ask Sethji...

128
00:13:46,000 --> 00:13:49,937
He has never said no to me
He gave Rs. 500 for my...

129
00:13:50,066 --> 00:13:56,272
...son's marriage not as a
Ioan but just like that.

130
00:13:56,399 --> 00:14:03,273
l have worked for many years
now and l have become old now

131
00:14:03,399 --> 00:14:05,969
And l am not able
to complete the work, son

132
00:14:06,066 --> 00:14:08,501
Sethii incurs a loss
due to me then.

133
00:14:10,066 --> 00:14:15,037
l've only told Sethii and he
has not dismissed me.

134
00:14:17,066 --> 00:14:20,936
He did not remove me.

135
00:14:32,366 --> 00:14:36,069
My glasses... l'll iust come

136
00:14:38,966 --> 00:14:42,336
You did a good thing, but what
is the use?

137
00:14:45,299 --> 00:14:48,136
Both of you have lost the iobs.
Is that old man going to...

138
00:14:48,200 --> 00:14:51,169
...remain there? If not today, Seth
is going to remove him tomorrow

139
00:14:51,233 --> 00:14:56,338
Let him dismiss him. My heart did'nt
agree and so l came off

140
00:14:57,466 --> 00:15:00,068
There is a post-card from
your uncle's place -When?

141
00:15:01,600 --> 00:15:05,570
ln the morning -What has he
written?-You only read it.

142
00:15:05,966 --> 00:15:10,003
lt is about the house
and about a job

143
00:15:15,533 --> 00:15:18,202
What is your opinion?
-What do you say?

144
00:15:21,166 --> 00:15:25,270
l feel that, you do this
job for the time being

145
00:15:26,133 --> 00:15:30,604
Regarding that Dixit, l'm sure U
will get that job in 5-6 months

146
00:15:30,666 --> 00:15:33,201
And l am here only and will
inform you.

147
00:15:34,133 --> 00:15:37,336
Now U do this iob in the village
and also solve that house issue

148
00:15:40,466 --> 00:15:44,970
Another love letter has come
-What is it?-Where is it?

149
00:15:49,266 --> 00:15:56,306
Notice.. Send rent within 10 days
or you've to vacate this lodge

150
00:16:13,299 --> 00:16:20,040
ls this any life? l will go home
and send money from there

151
00:16:21,500 --> 00:16:25,503
Come on. Some way will
come from somewhere. Is'nt it?

152
00:16:33,666 --> 00:16:37,302
l am a wanderer, friends,

153
00:16:39,133 --> 00:16:43,370
l have no house
or no place to live

154
00:16:53,100 --> 00:16:56,536
l am a wanderer, friends,

155
00:16:56,600 --> 00:17:01,671
l have no house
or no place to live

156
00:17:02,500 --> 00:17:05,469
l have to keep going

157
00:17:07,966 --> 00:17:11,469
l iust have to keep going

158
00:17:18,366 --> 00:17:22,002
l am a wanderer, friends,

159
00:17:22,066 --> 00:17:26,670
l have no house
or no place to live

160
00:17:27,633 --> 00:17:30,869
l have to keep going

161
00:17:32,366 --> 00:17:36,603
l iust have to keep going

162
00:17:57,099 --> 00:18:04,640
lf one way stopped,
another one joined with it

163
00:18:07,066 --> 00:18:14,339
l also turned with it as
the path also turned

164
00:18:20,666 --> 00:18:28,607
lf one way stopped,
another one joined with it

165
00:18:31,533 --> 00:18:39,207
l also turned with it as
the path also turned

166
00:18:39,266 --> 00:18:48,608
My house exists on
the wings of the air

167
00:18:48,666 --> 00:18:52,536
l am a wanderer, friends

168
00:18:53,866 --> 00:18:57,202
l have no house
or no place to live

169
00:18:58,333 --> 00:19:07,308
l have to keep going
l just have to keep going

170
00:19:14,400 --> 00:19:23,208
The days caught my hand
and made me sit here

171
00:19:23,266 --> 00:19:32,041
The night gave a sign and
called me elsewhere

172
00:19:42,666 --> 00:19:51,007
The days caught my hand
and made me sit here

173
00:19:51,066 --> 00:19:59,974
The night gave a sign and
called me elsewhere

174
00:20:02,299 --> 00:20:10,074
This is my story
from morning to evening

175
00:20:10,933 --> 00:20:14,870
l am a wanderer, friends

176
00:20:14,933 --> 00:20:19,537
l have no house
or no place to live

177
00:20:20,400 --> 00:20:29,675
l have to keep going
l just have to keep going

178
00:21:10,066 --> 00:21:12,468
See, it spreads as
much as it eats.

179
00:21:18,566 --> 00:21:19,533
Hello, Aunty

180
00:21:20,233 --> 00:21:22,368
Ravi...
-May you live long

181
00:21:23,633 --> 00:21:27,169
Are you listening? You have
grown a moustache and now...

182
00:21:27,233 --> 00:21:29,101
...you are looking very big

183
00:21:30,200 --> 00:21:34,170
He used to be half deaf before
and now when l call, he can't...

184
00:21:34,233 --> 00:21:38,604
...hear even when l shout loudly.
See, who has come.

185
00:21:39,500 --> 00:21:47,107
Ravi, you have really come
-How did you come suddenly?

186
00:21:47,166 --> 00:21:49,468
You did'nt write or inform.
-l had written a letter

187
00:21:49,533 --> 00:21:52,402
l did not know that, as he
never tells me anything

188
00:21:52,466 --> 00:21:55,535
l wrote a letter but did not think
that he will really come

189
00:21:56,333 --> 00:21:58,601
l had written many letters
earlier also, but did he come.

190
00:21:59,400 --> 00:22:01,902
Uncle, the search for a iob in
the city does not give...

191
00:22:01,966 --> 00:22:04,635
...us any free time at all
-But you had written that...

192
00:22:04,866 --> 00:22:07,568
...you were working for
an Iron factory- Yes

193
00:22:07,633 --> 00:22:09,534
But there was a strike and
l lost the job- This is bad

194
00:22:10,966 --> 00:22:12,967
l will iust come - What do you
have to do with the strike?

195
00:22:13,033 --> 00:22:16,336
This politics suits only two
kinds of people

196
00:22:17,366 --> 00:22:20,469
One who has no worry of food
& another who has nothing to...

197
00:22:20,533 --> 00:22:25,938
...eat in his house. Tell me, have
you got the other job.

198
00:22:26,966 --> 00:22:30,469
No, but there is hope that l will
get the job in 6-8 months

199
00:22:31,266 --> 00:22:35,136
Then, till that time, you do this
job. Small amounts of...

200
00:22:35,200 --> 00:22:38,503
...Rs. 400-500 does not make any
difference to Rai Saheb

201
00:22:39,133 --> 00:22:42,469
He iust wants that his grand
children should study

202
00:22:43,400 --> 00:22:47,971
Have you called him to send him
to those dangerous children.

203
00:22:48,566 --> 00:22:52,403
Don't you dare to send
him to that Bungalow?

204
00:22:53,666 --> 00:22:55,567
Are Rai Saheb's grand children
so dangerous?

205
00:22:56,433 --> 00:22:59,536
Not dangerous, they are the
messengers of death, son

206
00:22:59,599 --> 00:23:03,637
God knows, what all she hears
-l hear everything correctly

207
00:23:03,866 --> 00:23:06,568
l am not deaf like you. Kranti's
mother has told me everything

208
00:23:07,366 --> 00:23:10,469
But what did they do?
-What to say, son?

209
00:23:11,099 --> 00:23:13,502
Dozens of masters have come
there but nobody stays

210
00:23:13,866 --> 00:23:15,667
ln the last master's bed, who
came from Delhi, those...

211
00:23:15,900 --> 00:23:16,533
...children had thrown such a
big snake that he ran...

212
00:23:18,166 --> 00:23:21,435
Don't make it so big, it was not
a snake but a tortoise.

213
00:23:21,500 --> 00:23:26,605
Let it be. One was from Banares
who ran away overnight.

214
00:23:26,666 --> 00:23:29,168
He must have been from Bareili
and not Banares

215
00:23:29,233 --> 00:23:30,467
Whatever it is, he ran away?

216
00:23:31,466 --> 00:23:34,869
Listen Ravi, after listening to
your aunty, if your mind does'nt...

217
00:23:34,933 --> 00:23:41,339
...accept, don't take up the iob
Go and meet Rai Saheb once.

218
00:23:42,200 --> 00:23:45,636
lf he likes you, he might take
you in his business.

219
00:23:46,900 --> 00:23:50,370
Lines of your hand show
that you will go in business

220
00:23:50,433 --> 00:23:53,469
You will get a royal kingdom
when your good time comes.

221
00:23:54,233 --> 00:23:58,537
Unnecessarily you scared him.
Was Ravi any less naughty...

222
00:23:58,599 --> 00:24:01,302
...in his childhood. He had tied a
frog in your hair and...

223
00:24:01,366 --> 00:24:05,336
...you danced like anything.

224
00:24:08,200 --> 00:24:11,670
l had also beaten him a lot.
Come and eat now.

225
00:24:13,400 --> 00:24:17,904
Greetings, Panditii
-Has Rai Saheb come down?

226
00:24:18,599 --> 00:24:22,570
Yes- Come Ravi- Is this the
new master? - Yes

227
00:24:29,233 --> 00:24:31,668
Just say yes to anything he
says. Don't get scared at all

228
00:24:39,500 --> 00:24:43,604
May l come in?
-Come, Panditji

229
00:24:45,966 --> 00:24:50,103
This's Ravi, my nephew.He came
soon after he got my letter

230
00:25:01,599 --> 00:25:02,600
Please sit...

231
00:25:12,466 --> 00:25:17,604
How much have you studied?
-l did BA, and wanted to do MA

232
00:25:17,666 --> 00:25:19,534
l did'nt ask you what you wanted
to study.

233
00:25:21,500 --> 00:25:24,603
What have you studied?
-BA

234
00:25:27,666 --> 00:25:32,537
His face has no smile
at all

235
00:25:34,400 --> 00:25:37,302
ln what subiect have you done
your BA?- In Economics, as l...

236
00:25:38,166 --> 00:25:41,669
l did'nt ask you for the reason.
One who answers without any...

237
00:25:41,900 --> 00:25:44,068
...reason is often lying

238
00:25:45,166 --> 00:25:48,402
This fellow is a demon
he is running to eat

239
00:25:48,466 --> 00:25:51,535
What were you doing in the city?
-Nothing

240
00:25:52,633 --> 00:25:54,668
Then how were you managing?
-lt was a problem now-a-days

241
00:25:56,466 --> 00:26:00,269
What were you doing before
that?-l used to take tuitions

242
00:26:01,500 --> 00:26:05,637
Which class?- From 1st to 10th
-How much were you earning?

243
00:26:06,333 --> 00:26:11,404
Enough to survive -Were your
students scared of you?

244
00:26:11,866 --> 00:26:14,335
No - Then - They used
to love me.

245
00:26:17,566 --> 00:26:22,637
But if the children are rogues...
-Children are never rogues

246
00:26:23,666 --> 00:26:26,502
They might be naughty and
do pranks

247
00:26:29,933 --> 00:26:31,668
Can you correct them if they
are naughty?

248
00:26:32,533 --> 00:26:36,036
l can try my best
-Will you run away?

249
00:26:38,933 --> 00:26:41,635
l won't run without informing
you. l can tell you this much

250
00:26:43,666 --> 00:26:46,101
Can you stay in this bungalow,
if you get a place?

251
00:26:47,299 --> 00:26:49,602
Yes, uncle has already told me

252
00:26:50,366 --> 00:26:54,503
Your uncle must've also told U
that there is strict disciple here

253
00:26:55,299 --> 00:26:57,502
Can you accept the rules and
stay here?

254
00:26:58,233 --> 00:27:01,269
l don't know the rules here.
Then how can l say whether...

255
00:27:01,333 --> 00:27:02,500
...l will stay or not.

256
00:27:06,633 --> 00:27:11,871
What'll you've? Tea or iuice.
-Nothing, Come Ravi

257
00:27:14,566 --> 00:27:17,068
Panditii, you sit here

258
00:27:25,633 --> 00:27:29,370
Let this iob go to hell
The way he talks...

259
00:27:43,966 --> 00:27:47,069
A hole has come
in these shoes.

260
00:27:56,266 --> 00:28:00,036
l felt proud when the Rai Saheb
said that he has never seen...

261
00:28:00,099 --> 00:28:02,602
...a master like this before and
fixed the salary immediately.

262
00:28:03,900 --> 00:28:06,369
Lodging and boarding expenses
are separate from that.

263
00:28:07,200 --> 00:28:10,036
l was scared in the beginning but
Ravi also answered so abruptly...

264
00:28:10,099 --> 00:28:13,536
...that it was fun- Yes, you will
get lots of comfort by sending...

265
00:28:13,599 --> 00:28:16,235
...Ravi to those demon like
children.

266
00:28:16,966 --> 00:28:18,400
l will see to you if something
happens to him

267
00:28:18,533 --> 00:28:23,104
You talk as if l am sending him
to war - What else then?

268
00:28:23,533 --> 00:28:27,536
The soldiers have guns in their
hands. What're U giving him?

269
00:28:28,133 --> 00:28:30,935
Aunty, why're you so scared?
They are only children and...

270
00:28:31,000 --> 00:28:33,969
...what can they do? It is also
bad that someone stops...

271
00:28:34,033 --> 00:28:36,902
...teaching children by getting
scared. Let us see who is...

272
00:28:36,966 --> 00:28:41,103
...more clever. If they are
monkeys, then l am also...

273
00:28:42,966 --> 00:28:45,168
What has happened to your
shoes?-Yes, what happened?

274
00:28:46,266 --> 00:28:49,469
Coal fell on it and that part
was thrown away

275
00:28:50,266 --> 00:28:52,534
Then why should you wear it?
You should have taken a new one

276
00:28:53,133 --> 00:28:55,401
You come with me tomorrow. We
will get new shoes and clothes

277
00:28:58,866 --> 00:29:02,402
The new shoes have to be oiled
-What? -Come, Masterji

278
00:29:17,200 --> 00:29:21,671
lf you want anything, your press
that buzzer. l will hear the...

279
00:29:21,900 --> 00:29:25,336
...bell and l will come. You sit
and l will inform our sir.

280
00:29:26,400 --> 00:29:29,436
Do you need any tea or tiffin
-No, l don't want anything

281
00:30:53,000 --> 00:30:56,002
Tell us, what do you want?

282
00:30:56,066 --> 00:31:01,337
l was iust seeing, who stays
where?

283
00:31:02,166 --> 00:31:04,968
Next time, you knock the door
before coming into anyone's room

284
00:31:05,033 --> 00:31:07,402
She also looks like
the queen of Jhansi.

285
00:31:08,266 --> 00:31:11,202
l'm sorry. l will take
care from next time.

286
00:31:21,900 --> 00:31:31,342
Masterii... Have you been
beaten as soon as you came?

287
00:31:32,433 --> 00:31:36,203
Are your legs and hands alright?
Hope you are not hurt - No...

288
00:31:37,000 --> 00:31:41,137
All these are those children's
pranks. l will just tell madam.

289
00:31:41,566 --> 00:31:45,036
She will hit them with the hunter
that they will learn the lesson

290
00:31:47,566 --> 00:31:49,234
Listen, no need to say anything
to anyone.

291
00:31:49,299 --> 00:31:52,102
No, you keep them under control
now itself...

292
00:31:52,933 --> 00:31:54,501
...or they will even take
your moustache from your face

293
00:31:55,033 --> 00:32:01,406
What? -Sorry, l iust went on
talking without speaking

294
00:32:02,099 --> 00:32:05,303
What is your name?- l'm Narain
and my father's name is...

295
00:32:05,366 --> 00:32:09,136
Leave your father...-Yes, what
is the use of the father now?

296
00:32:12,000 --> 00:32:13,935
How long have you been working
here?

297
00:32:14,333 --> 00:32:17,169
From the age of 14 years, l
have been serving sir

298
00:32:17,900 --> 00:32:21,970
l forgot that sir is calling
you downstairs in the hall

299
00:32:22,900 --> 00:32:24,034
You go and l will come.

300
00:32:29,099 --> 00:32:32,069
May l come in?
-Yes, come in

301
00:32:39,666 --> 00:32:41,334
Sit...

302
00:32:49,966 --> 00:32:51,233
Be prepared, son

303
00:32:55,266 --> 00:32:58,869
They were iust children. He is
their father's father.

304
00:33:02,200 --> 00:33:04,201
Have l been entangled into
this problem unnecessarily?

305
00:33:06,033 --> 00:33:10,470
Have you seen the room?
-Yes - Is it okay? - Yes

306
00:33:10,533 --> 00:33:14,069
lf you want anything,
tell Narain.

307
00:33:16,966 --> 00:33:21,003
l have called them so that l can
introduce you to your students

308
00:33:26,200 --> 00:33:28,869
Here the whole group
is spoiled

309
00:33:29,366 --> 00:33:30,066
Where is Rama?

310
00:33:32,166 --> 00:33:33,066
Where is Rama?

311
00:33:37,266 --> 00:33:40,569
Rama is the eldest. When she
was studying Metric,...

312
00:33:40,633 --> 00:33:43,602
...her studies were interrupted.

313
00:33:45,400 --> 00:33:49,103
This is Aiay, he was in 5th
or 6th class.

314
00:33:49,900 --> 00:33:51,568
He fought with the master in the
school and ran off...

315
00:33:51,633 --> 00:33:53,468
...And now he has left
the studies.

316
00:33:54,566 --> 00:33:57,568
Their parents never tried to send
him to school again.

317
00:34:01,333 --> 00:34:07,338
The younger one is Viiay, then
Munni whose name is Meeta...

318
00:34:07,400 --> 00:34:09,168
...and that is Saniay

319
00:34:11,166 --> 00:34:13,167
These children have not gone to
school at all in a way.

320
00:34:13,933 --> 00:34:16,068
Last year, whatever the dozen
masters who came here ...

321
00:34:16,133 --> 00:34:17,234
...could teach them, they
have taught them.

322
00:34:18,466 --> 00:34:23,003
Rest is on you now. Teach them
as much as you can.

323
00:34:23,633 --> 00:34:26,669
Brother, did you see this?
-What is this?

324
00:34:27,400 --> 00:34:29,969
The leg of the chair which
was in the master's room.

325
00:34:30,033 --> 00:34:31,968
These naughty children have
broken it

326
00:34:32,033 --> 00:34:34,535
Masterii sat on the chair and
then fell down.

327
00:34:36,133 --> 00:34:40,036
No, l did'nt fall, as l did not
sit at all.

328
00:34:40,966 --> 00:34:44,336
Why are U telling excuses? See the
injury you got on your forehead...

329
00:34:44,400 --> 00:34:50,372
...when you fell - This one. l got
hurt with the nail in the Tonga

330
00:34:50,433 --> 00:34:53,536
Shakti, you go and don't argue
mOre

331
00:35:00,366 --> 00:35:04,036
You people also go and keep
your books & notebooks ready

332
00:35:04,500 --> 00:35:06,668
The new master will
teach you. You go now..

333
00:35:15,333 --> 00:35:17,401
l will also go, sir

334
00:35:19,666 --> 00:35:25,905
Did your uncle say anything to
U as to who these children are?

335
00:35:26,266 --> 00:35:32,038
Yes, he was saying that they are
the children of Ur son Nilesh Rai

336
00:35:32,966 --> 00:35:36,202
He also told me the condition in
which they were brought here

337
00:35:37,000 --> 00:35:39,035
Then, no need to say anything
else to you.

338
00:35:41,166 --> 00:35:46,204
l iust want to say that you don't
get carried away by their ...

339
00:35:46,266 --> 00:35:49,569
...faces. All of them are very
naughty.

340
00:35:51,566 --> 00:35:56,270
lf you deal with them, you will
feel that l have got some...

341
00:35:56,333 --> 00:35:58,068
...animals from the zoo. None of
them show any attribute to...

342
00:35:58,133 --> 00:36:00,368
...become a human

343
00:36:03,599 --> 00:36:07,070
l know they have been brought
up in great poverty.

344
00:36:07,300 --> 00:36:12,138
But that does not mean they
should lack the basic discipline

345
00:36:13,033 --> 00:36:14,634
lf they could not learn from their
father, they could have learnt...

346
00:36:14,866 --> 00:36:17,068
...some behaviour from
neighbours.

347
00:36:18,366 --> 00:36:20,568
But it seems that these children
have taken a oath not to...

348
00:36:20,633 --> 00:36:22,101
...learn anything at all

349
00:36:24,199 --> 00:36:26,602
The one good thing about these
children is their unity

350
00:36:27,366 --> 00:36:32,637
lf you punish one, all of them
go on a hunger strike

351
00:36:34,333 --> 00:36:38,136
Rama is the eldest of them
of all but has the most...

352
00:36:38,199 --> 00:36:42,137
...fighting nature & stubborn.
She is very short-tempered

353
00:36:42,900 --> 00:36:45,602
She can't tolerate Sati even
for a moment and me...

354
00:36:51,166 --> 00:36:53,935
She thinks that l am her
father's killer.

355
00:36:54,900 --> 00:36:58,670
She thinks, l did'nt bother about
Nilesh deliberately but...

356
00:36:59,666 --> 00:37:05,872
...l actually waited for him
always thinking that he may..

357
00:37:08,366 --> 00:37:14,205
Ravi, l don't know why l hope
that U can correct these children

358
00:37:15,000 --> 00:37:17,936
Till now, no teacher has taken
these children's side.

359
00:37:18,000 --> 00:37:22,404
You got hurt as you fell from the
chair but said U got hurt in tonga

360
00:37:23,666 --> 00:37:28,437
Ravi, there won't be any bigger
favour for me than...

361
00:37:28,500 --> 00:37:32,971
...making these children into
human beings.

362
00:37:35,033 --> 00:37:39,971
l will try my best to teach them
and advise them.

363
00:37:41,566 --> 00:37:46,103
Children seem to be intelligent
but they are only stubborn

364
00:37:47,033 --> 00:37:49,568
lf these children come to the
right way, you will be surely...

365
00:37:49,633 --> 00:37:51,968
...very proud of them
in future.

366
00:37:52,033 --> 00:37:55,536
You won't worry about these
children now.

367
00:37:55,599 --> 00:38:01,038
Leave them to me. l believe that
l will be able to control them.

368
00:38:03,633 --> 00:38:05,935
Shall l go then? Let me
prepare for my work.

369
00:38:39,400 --> 00:38:40,634
What happened, Masterii?

370
00:38:41,400 --> 00:38:44,936
Don't you know that it is
forbidden to laugh here...

371
00:38:45,000 --> 00:38:46,968
...as your salary will be cut
-What?

372
00:38:47,033 --> 00:38:49,935
Yes, every month 10-15 rupees
are cut from my salary.

373
00:38:50,466 --> 00:38:53,402
Hence, l run towards the iungle
whenever l feel like laughing.

374
00:38:54,466 --> 00:38:56,901
Mad fellow, when you want to
Iaugh, have a hearty laugh

375
00:38:57,633 --> 00:38:57,866
l will give you your salary.

376
00:39:04,000 --> 00:39:06,068
Who was laughing so loudly
now? - Masterji

377
00:39:06,966 --> 00:39:08,634
He told me to laugh too.
l ran away.

378
00:39:26,666 --> 00:39:31,103
You all do very good drawing.
But one thing is extra here

379
00:39:32,000 --> 00:39:34,202
l won't need this.

380
00:39:38,433 --> 00:39:44,071
You must all be having
your note-books and books

381
00:39:48,333 --> 00:39:51,869
Do like this. Close your
books and note-books

382
00:39:52,533 --> 00:39:54,468
l will neither teach you
nor you will study.

383
00:39:55,266 --> 00:39:56,900
We will iust talk.
Ok.

384
00:39:57,566 --> 00:40:00,869
He is telling lies.
He will surely teach us

385
00:40:03,300 --> 00:40:05,402
Let me learn your names
first.

386
00:40:06,400 --> 00:40:12,472
You are Aiay, you're Viiay,
you're Meeta and you're Sanjay

387
00:40:13,966 --> 00:40:15,067
Did l say correctly?

388
00:40:18,633 --> 00:40:21,902
ls'nt it? Answer me.
-That old man told you that

389
00:40:23,300 --> 00:40:26,369
No, Meetaii, you should not
call him like that

390
00:40:27,233 --> 00:40:29,168
He is an old man as his
moustache is also white

391
00:40:30,233 --> 00:40:32,935
No, Saniu Babu. Do you know
who he is to you?

392
00:40:35,500 --> 00:40:38,469
Aiay, do you know what
is his relation with you?

393
00:40:38,933 --> 00:40:48,008
He is my pop's pop?
-Correct, absolutely right

394
00:40:50,166 --> 00:40:53,335
Did you call your father
as pop?

395
00:40:54,366 --> 00:40:55,900
No.. as Babuii

396
00:40:56,533 --> 00:41:00,470
How did your Babuii
call his father? - Babuji

397
00:41:01,233 --> 00:41:04,069
That is good. That means he
is your Babuji's Babuji.

398
00:41:04,933 --> 00:41:07,535
Then who is he to you?
-Our grandfather

399
00:41:07,599 --> 00:41:11,003
lf both their photos are kept
before you, how will you...

400
00:41:11,066 --> 00:41:14,602
... say whose photos are they?
-One is Babuji's

401
00:41:15,033 --> 00:41:18,035
Good, another one..
-His pop's

402
00:41:21,900 --> 00:41:25,270
Don't you all feel hot?
You have not put the fan.

403
00:42:07,433 --> 00:42:09,101
l am dead.
It is already 9 O' clock

404
00:42:50,166 --> 00:42:52,067
Good evening, everybody

405
00:42:53,199 --> 00:42:54,200
Shut up.

406
00:42:57,900 --> 00:42:59,334
What happened?

407
00:43:00,099 --> 00:43:06,172
What happened to you?-To me!
- Wash your face & come

408
00:43:06,466 --> 00:43:10,002
What do you mean? -Don't you
have a mirror in your room?

409
00:43:22,466 --> 00:43:24,968
No, master. You keep them under
control from now itself or...

410
00:43:25,033 --> 00:43:27,235
...they will even snatch
your moustache

411
00:43:31,133 --> 00:43:34,069
lt is better that you only remove
your moustache or it will...

412
00:43:34,133 --> 00:43:36,101
...go some day.

413
00:43:37,133 --> 00:43:38,634
Now why are you standing
and thinking something.

414
00:43:40,666 --> 00:43:42,868
Nothing, l was listening
to my second track.

415
00:43:43,566 --> 00:43:46,302
Second track
-ldiot...

416
00:43:48,466 --> 00:43:56,540
This is children's work.
Where should l wash my face.

417
00:44:03,033 --> 00:44:04,267
Who has done this?

418
00:44:07,500 --> 00:44:11,971
Won't you tell? You tell or else
l will beat each one of you.

419
00:44:18,000 --> 00:44:23,271
l will also see. Saniu, tell
me who did this.

420
00:44:25,266 --> 00:44:27,034
Tell me quickly
who did this

421
00:44:28,333 --> 00:44:31,669
Leave him, as such a small child
can't be so naughty.

422
00:44:32,566 --> 00:44:35,869
Then who did this prank.
-l did this, punish me now

423
00:44:43,966 --> 00:44:45,967
Sati, why are you also becoming
shamelsss along with her?

424
00:44:50,666 --> 00:44:54,069
Go away. You won't get any
_ood.

425
00:44:54,666 --> 00:44:56,167
lf you stay hungry, you
will come to your senses

426
00:45:14,566 --> 00:45:16,034
You eat your food

427
00:45:33,633 --> 00:45:36,635
Narain...- Yes, masterii

428
00:45:39,133 --> 00:45:40,501
Come in...

429
00:45:42,166 --> 00:45:49,006
Who has kept this here?
-l have kept it- Why?

430
00:45:50,000 --> 00:45:50,633
The elder madam told me to
keep this.

431
00:45:52,900 --> 00:45:56,637
Go and give this to her and tell
her that l don't teach children...

432
00:45:56,866 --> 00:45:59,235
...with sticks. Go now

433
00:46:05,533 --> 00:46:07,635
Saniu, come here.

434
00:46:10,166 --> 00:46:11,500
Come here, son.

435
00:46:17,166 --> 00:46:18,100
Why are you looking here and
there?

436
00:46:18,166 --> 00:46:19,901
When l am calling,
you come here.

437
00:46:21,500 --> 00:46:23,501
Get your books with you

438
00:46:23,566 --> 00:46:25,367
Show me.

439
00:46:29,599 --> 00:46:33,937
Where are the starting pages?
-l had already studied them

440
00:46:34,300 --> 00:46:40,673
Then you tore them. -Will you
read the rest or not - No

441
00:46:42,066 --> 00:46:47,070
Ok, l will teach you whenever
you feel like. Go and sit

442
00:46:47,133 --> 00:46:50,069
Go and sit, son

443
00:46:52,599 --> 00:46:55,102
What is this?
-Won't you beat me?

444
00:47:04,099 --> 00:47:07,670
Masteriii, why have you sent this
stick to me -As it is yours...

445
00:47:08,466 --> 00:47:12,336
lt is mine, but you don't know
why l've kept it in the classroom

446
00:47:12,466 --> 00:47:13,266
l know it.

447
00:47:16,566 --> 00:47:19,669
What does this mean? -lt
means, it is my responsibility...

448
00:47:19,900 --> 00:47:21,101
...to teach the children and not
yours.

449
00:47:21,900 --> 00:47:23,067
l wish that you don't interfere
in my work.

450
00:47:23,599 --> 00:47:26,069
l don't want to listen to what
you want or you don't want.

451
00:47:26,966 --> 00:47:29,868
l had kept this stick in this
room and it will stay here

452
00:47:31,866 --> 00:47:34,868
Sati Devi, you are surely
educated but you also need...

453
00:47:34,933 --> 00:47:38,336
...to learn behaviour and
discipline just like these...

454
00:47:38,400 --> 00:47:39,567
Masterii...

455
00:47:40,033 --> 00:47:42,001
lt is disrespectful for you to
come inside this class-room...

456
00:47:42,066 --> 00:47:44,601
...without permission, when
the master is present.

457
00:47:44,666 --> 00:47:46,334
You might not have learnt
this anywhere.

458
00:47:46,633 --> 00:47:50,970
Sati, Ravi is right.
You come out.

459
00:48:11,066 --> 00:48:13,234
Aiay, what did the teacher
before me teach you?

460
00:48:14,133 --> 00:48:16,001
Geography -What did you read
in Geography?

461
00:48:26,000 --> 00:48:27,634
Who is eating here?

462
00:48:37,500 --> 00:48:42,571
Saniubaba, what are you eating.
Won't you give it to me.

463
00:48:44,066 --> 00:48:45,600
Atleast show me what you
are eating.

464
00:48:51,666 --> 00:48:53,134
Why did you throw his toast?

465
00:48:53,900 --> 00:48:57,203
He won't eat & no one will eat
anything till sister eats food

466
00:49:02,466 --> 00:49:05,101
Has'nt your sister eaten anything
from yesterday.

467
00:49:06,033 --> 00:49:07,067
l also did not eat.

468
00:49:12,166 --> 00:49:16,403
Don't get scared. We all will sit
and eat together.- And sister...

469
00:49:17,099 --> 00:49:17,900
She will also eat.

470
00:49:18,099 --> 00:49:24,272
Sister won't eat. -lf she does
not eat, l also won't eat.

471
00:49:25,966 --> 00:49:29,502
l will also go on hunger strike
with all of you. Is it ok?

472
00:49:30,233 --> 00:49:31,367
You all study, l will iust come

473
00:49:34,599 --> 00:49:35,334
May l come in?

474
00:49:43,633 --> 00:49:44,233
Come

475
00:49:47,533 --> 00:49:52,137
You also left the class and came
for complaining about children

476
00:49:52,433 --> 00:49:54,401
Not against the children
l have come to complain...

477
00:49:54,466 --> 00:49:57,502
...against you to yourself only.

478
00:49:58,533 --> 00:50:02,203
l don't think these children need
a teacher.

479
00:50:03,199 --> 00:50:04,634
You have called me
unnecessarily

480
00:50:05,633 --> 00:50:10,537
Meaning !- These children don't
need education but need...

481
00:50:10,599 --> 00:50:16,605
...love and sympathy which can't
be given by you or Sati Devi

482
00:50:17,300 --> 00:50:21,537
lf love can be made into a tablet
and given, l would have given it

483
00:50:22,566 --> 00:50:25,435
But the difficulty is that we
don't get tablets for love...

484
00:50:25,500 --> 00:50:27,501
...which l can give to these
children.

485
00:50:28,266 --> 00:50:32,203
l brought them here from those
huts and tried to give them...

486
00:50:32,266 --> 00:50:38,538
...all comforts and facilities and
tried to make them more human.

487
00:50:39,266 --> 00:50:41,368
Have l done all this because
l don't love them?

488
00:50:42,366 --> 00:50:45,502
You are calling comforts and
facilities as love but...

489
00:50:45,566 --> 00:50:51,538
...these things can be got by any
patient in any hospital.

490
00:50:52,266 --> 00:50:56,570
You have given facilities of live
but not motherly love

491
00:50:57,933 --> 00:51:01,569
You are fulfilling their necessities
but only the parents can...

492
00:51:01,633 --> 00:51:03,601
...give the love they need

493
00:51:05,366 --> 00:51:07,201
They don't have to see the
children's qualities for that

494
00:51:07,266 --> 00:51:09,434
What do you mean to say?

495
00:51:10,199 --> 00:51:13,403
Yesterday night you had punished
Rama & did'nt give her food

496
00:51:14,266 --> 00:51:15,934
The children also went without
food due to that.

497
00:51:16,566 --> 00:51:20,336
Have you ever tried to pacify
them even once?

498
00:51:20,900 --> 00:51:25,271
Many times, Ravi. l know that
the parents who punish also...

499
00:51:25,333 --> 00:51:28,536
...give love to the children but
the stubbornness and insolence...

500
00:51:28,599 --> 00:51:32,036
...of these children is...

501
00:51:32,099 --> 00:51:34,402
You have been kept for this only.
If you can teach and advice...

502
00:51:34,466 --> 00:51:38,102
...these children, you stay.

503
00:51:38,233 --> 00:51:40,635
Or you can also go.

504
00:51:56,433 --> 00:51:57,367
Who is it?

505
00:51:59,633 --> 00:52:05,171
You - Can l come inside
-Come in

506
00:52:08,566 --> 00:52:11,402
Sit - l have come to
ask you something.

507
00:52:14,300 --> 00:52:16,068
Do you know why l have
been called here?

508
00:52:17,199 --> 00:52:21,571
Yes, we have all come from the
zoo and hence you have been...

509
00:52:21,633 --> 00:52:25,203
...called to teach the animals the
way to live in a palace.

510
00:52:26,199 --> 00:52:30,203
You are angry, Rama and hence
-You address me with respect

511
00:52:30,966 --> 00:52:31,933
l am not your student

512
00:52:32,566 --> 00:52:36,202
l know and have heard that you
don't want to study.

513
00:52:36,933 --> 00:52:40,936
But l had come to ask you
something else. - Ask me?

514
00:52:41,566 --> 00:52:45,569
l heard that many masters came
here before me and all ran away

515
00:52:45,633 --> 00:52:49,536
Or were made to run. If you
think that l should also run...

516
00:52:49,599 --> 00:52:52,002
...you tell me so that l will
myself go away.

517
00:52:52,500 --> 00:52:55,069
l neither called you nor will l
tell you to go.

518
00:52:55,599 --> 00:52:57,034
You ask this question to
Rai Saheb.

519
00:52:58,000 --> 00:53:01,169
l had come to ask you because
the children for whom l...

520
00:53:01,233 --> 00:53:04,970
...was called, their responsibility
lies more with you than Rai Saheb

521
00:53:07,066 --> 00:53:10,202
Nobody needs to be taught here.
The fight is in the family...

522
00:53:10,266 --> 00:53:11,333
...and not for children's education.

523
00:53:12,466 --> 00:53:17,003
l am going away, but your young
sisters and brothers are...

524
00:53:17,066 --> 00:53:20,269
...so lovable that l thought l'll
tell you this before going.

525
00:53:21,300 --> 00:53:27,506
lf Rai Saheb is doing wrong,
U're also not doing anything good

526
00:53:27,566 --> 00:53:28,366
Rai Saheb lost his son in
his stubbornness

527
00:53:28,433 --> 00:53:31,536
But if something happens to any
of these children due to your...

528
00:53:31,599 --> 00:53:33,435
...stubbornness, you will be
responsibile for that and not...

529
00:53:33,500 --> 00:53:35,635
...Rai Saheb-Why are you giving
me so much advice?

530
00:53:36,533 --> 00:53:38,601
The reason is that you can stay
without food even for ten days.

531
00:53:39,099 --> 00:53:43,471
But small Saniu and Neeta...
how long will they stay hungry

532
00:53:45,633 --> 00:53:49,470
Even if Rai Saheb bends before
you for the sake of the...

533
00:53:49,533 --> 00:53:51,534
...children, don't think that
you will become big.

534
00:53:52,466 --> 00:53:54,034
You will be proved much
smaller than him.

535
00:53:58,366 --> 00:54:01,202
l will speak with Rai Saheb
and go away tonight.

536
00:54:02,266 --> 00:54:05,969
But if another master comes,
instead of driving him away...

537
00:54:06,033 --> 00:54:09,269
...make him your friend and be
patient till these children ...

538
00:54:09,333 --> 00:54:12,569
...study & become eligible for
going to any hostel.

539
00:54:16,233 --> 00:54:16,666
Otherwise, you think yourself
as to what will happen to...

540
00:54:16,900 --> 00:54:18,134
...these children.

541
00:55:20,500 --> 00:55:24,670
Caught you - Are you here or
gone away?- Why?

542
00:55:26,000 --> 00:55:27,668
Sister asked me to see
and come.-Wait...

543
00:55:37,233 --> 00:55:38,267
What are you doing,
masterji?

544
00:55:39,266 --> 00:55:40,967
lf you are caught singing,
you will be killed

545
00:55:41,633 --> 00:55:42,367
Don't get into this habit
at all.

546
00:55:42,900 --> 00:55:46,970
What is wrong in singing?-That
is the root of this problem

547
00:55:47,533 --> 00:55:52,638
l would say, you go towards the
jungle, if you feel like singing

548
00:55:52,866 --> 00:55:55,602
Why should l go to the
jungle for singing?

549
00:55:56,466 --> 00:56:00,536
You also won't stay long as you
have all the bad habits.

550
00:56:01,133 --> 00:56:03,068
You suddenly start singing
or laughing

551
00:56:08,366 --> 00:56:13,471
Come here and sit
Sit...

552
00:56:13,533 --> 00:56:15,568
Tell me why Rai Saheb
is so annoyed with music.

553
00:56:16,333 --> 00:56:19,636
What you are talking?
Have'nt you heard that...

554
00:56:19,866 --> 00:56:22,268
...the one bit by a snake is
scared even of the rope.

555
00:56:22,633 --> 00:56:24,634
How can music be a poison
of which Rai Saheb is scared?

556
00:56:25,599 --> 00:56:28,102
lt has become a poison
for his life.

557
00:56:29,666 --> 00:56:34,303
Are you talking about Nilesh?
Did he used to sing very well?

558
00:56:35,000 --> 00:56:40,004
He was extremely good.
Our Diwan sir has heard...

559
00:56:40,066 --> 00:56:47,072
...him over the radio too.
But there is one thing, Masterji

560
00:56:47,533 --> 00:56:50,202
This music is also the work
of saints. Our younger master...

561
00:56:50,266 --> 00:56:54,203
...concentrated only on music
always for all 24 hours.

562
00:56:56,599 --> 00:57:01,538
When he used to sing in the
early morning, it used to...

563
00:57:01,599 --> 00:57:06,638
...feel as if he is waking
up the Goddess of a temple.

564
00:57:07,433 --> 00:57:10,235
l used to feel the fragrance of
incense sticks in his songs.

565
00:57:12,300 --> 00:57:15,436
The tree in the garden..
-_ es

566
00:57:16,166 --> 00:57:19,068
Sometimes he used to sit below
that tree to sing & sometimes...

567
00:57:19,133 --> 00:57:22,369
...in the terrace and used to be
Iost for hours

568
00:57:42,500 --> 00:57:44,501
My beloved...My beloved...

569
00:57:47,866 --> 00:57:52,937
My dear, you are talking
like honey

570
00:58:07,500 --> 00:58:12,905
Your lovely black eyes,
my dear...

571
00:58:12,966 --> 00:58:21,007
...are talking like honey

572
00:58:44,633 --> 00:58:48,636
The thirsty are still
yearning...

573
00:58:50,866 --> 00:58:56,504
...though it has been
raining for years.

574
00:58:59,433 --> 00:59:01,501
The thirsty are still
yearning.

575
00:59:06,033 --> 00:59:10,537
You, from when are you standing
here -For a long time, sir

576
00:59:12,866 --> 00:59:13,533
Lime water...

577
00:59:15,033 --> 00:59:16,901
Has father got up?
-Long back, he has told...

578
00:59:16,966 --> 00:59:19,668
...you to get ready by
10 O'clock- Why?

579
00:59:20,533 --> 00:59:21,934
Don't you have to go to
Choudhry's place who...

580
00:59:22,000 --> 00:59:24,302
...had come the other day
with his daughter?

581
00:59:24,966 --> 00:59:27,468
But l have to go to the city
today. What will l do there?

582
00:59:28,333 --> 00:59:31,936
All these visits are happening
only for your sake- For me!

583
00:59:32,500 --> 00:59:36,637
Sir, they are very wealthy people
-May be they are

584
00:59:37,366 --> 00:59:40,168
Will they give their wealth to me?
-Shall l tell something?

585
00:59:40,866 --> 00:59:42,334
l really liked that girl.

586
00:59:44,866 --> 00:59:48,669
Then do one thing.
You only marry her.

587
00:59:49,199 --> 00:59:51,602
l will search for someone
else for myself

588
00:59:52,500 --> 00:59:57,538
Jokes apart, you tell your father
and fix the alliance.

589
00:59:58,333 --> 01:00:02,537
Leave it, Narayan. Who'll get
stuck in marriage? Take his

590
01:00:13,400 --> 01:00:18,304
The thirsty are still yearning...

591
01:00:18,366 --> 01:00:28,075
...though it has been raining
_or years.

592
01:00:28,133 --> 01:00:31,336
Your eyes are sparkling

593
01:00:38,433 --> 01:00:41,135
Father, l will sing for the first
time with my teacher in...

594
01:00:41,199 --> 01:00:45,337
...the conference - Did'nt Narain
tell you anything in the morning?

595
01:00:45,400 --> 01:00:48,369
What? - Did'nt he tell you to
be ready by 10 O'clock as...

596
01:00:48,433 --> 01:00:51,202
..you have to come with me to
Mr. Choudhary's house

597
01:00:52,500 --> 01:00:57,471
But l have to go to the city
today by 11 :30 train, father

598
01:00:58,266 --> 01:01:03,170
For going to sing there
-Yes, father

599
01:01:03,233 --> 01:01:05,168
ls your singing more important
than going to Choudhry's place

600
01:01:05,233 --> 01:01:09,971
But Father -No one in our family
has ever answered so...

601
01:01:10,033 --> 01:01:12,535
...disrespectfully to his
father before.

602
01:01:12,599 --> 01:01:17,404
You can't come with me because
you have to sing.

603
01:01:18,433 --> 01:01:23,004
l'm singing in a music conference
& the tickets have been sold.

604
01:01:23,300 --> 01:01:27,671
And you will get money for it.
Is'nt it? How much will you get?

605
01:01:28,333 --> 01:01:31,602
Will you get enough money to
buy a coffin for your father?

606
01:01:32,666 --> 01:01:35,268
Did l send you to the hostel to
study or that you learn music...

607
01:01:35,333 --> 01:01:38,235
...and sing Qawwali and make
this bungalow into a brothel.

608
01:01:40,233 --> 01:01:43,169
Seeing your love for music, l
thought U've developed this...

609
01:01:43,233 --> 01:01:46,636
...taste of a rich man. l did'nt
know, you planned to earn ...

610
01:01:46,866 --> 01:01:49,935
...through singing. The place,
where a lady is asked to sing..

611
01:01:50,000 --> 01:01:53,303
...will you sit there and
sing now.

612
01:01:55,666 --> 01:02:01,104
You are thinking wrong. Ustad
Shivnath is a very great musician...

613
01:02:01,166 --> 01:02:04,435
...of India - Your teacher. l'm
going to Choudhary's place now

614
01:02:05,099 --> 01:02:07,302
Maybe you are not aware that
talks of your marriage with his...

615
01:02:07,366 --> 01:02:10,869
...daughter are going on. You also
reach Mr.Choudhary's place with..

616
01:02:10,933 --> 01:02:12,434
...your car. Did you understand?

617
01:02:25,633 --> 01:02:28,135
He was as stubborn as his
father is.

618
01:02:28,866 --> 01:02:31,368
He did'nt go to Mr. Chowdhary's
place.

619
01:02:32,300 --> 01:02:36,671
He wrote a letter and gave me
and went to the city.

620
01:02:37,933 --> 01:02:42,604
First time, l saw a father's
heart breaking

621
01:02:43,500 --> 01:02:49,939
l did'nt like it. Sir used to sit on
the dining table alone every...

622
01:02:50,000 --> 01:02:52,502
...day and used to get up alone

623
01:03:02,099 --> 01:03:04,202
The young master studied for
another year in the city and...

624
01:03:04,266 --> 01:03:07,636
...when he returned one day,
then...

625
01:03:26,333 --> 01:03:27,333
May you live long !

626
01:03:31,333 --> 01:03:34,903
May you live long, daughter!

627
01:03:37,433 --> 01:03:42,571
Your daughter-in-law, father.
Some event occurred in the...

628
01:03:42,633 --> 01:03:46,370
...city suddenly that l had to
marry and then only come back

629
01:03:48,133 --> 01:03:52,570
First we thought, we will call
you there or come here and...

630
01:03:52,633 --> 01:03:56,470
...get married but..
-But what..

631
01:03:57,333 --> 01:03:59,868
You were scared l might not
accept the daughter-in-law

632
01:04:01,900 --> 01:04:06,604
Son, a father is happy only when
his son is happy.

633
01:04:07,233 --> 01:04:10,603
Your mother is not there,
who can complete the...

634
01:04:10,666 --> 01:04:13,635
...traditions of welcoming the
bride. If l had known, l...

635
01:04:13,866 --> 01:04:15,500
...would have definitely arranged
for Shahnai.

636
01:04:16,400 --> 01:04:18,368
But what to do. You people did
not take me in at all.

637
01:04:19,199 --> 01:04:21,635
Take daughter-in-law upstairs.

638
01:04:36,533 --> 01:04:38,468
lt is 9 O'clock and still
father has not come

639
01:04:39,366 --> 01:04:42,402
This is the first time that father
has been late after l've been born.

640
01:04:43,333 --> 01:04:45,268
Maybe he was late before that.
l am not aware of it

641
01:04:46,966 --> 01:04:51,603
Or he is so punctual that l can
give key to my watch.

642
01:04:58,099 --> 01:05:02,604
Spinach vegetable... Father
likes it a lot. Where is he?

643
01:05:03,300 --> 01:05:09,506
Sir is not well. He told you to
eat and then called you to...

644
01:05:09,566 --> 01:05:14,871
1
...the hall.- If he is not well
why is'nt he in his room.

645
01:05:14,933 --> 01:05:16,901
l don't know, as he did not
say anything

646
01:05:20,000 --> 01:05:22,669
Listen, is Father upset because
of me.

647
01:05:23,466 --> 01:05:27,970
No, if he gets upset, it won't
be due to you...

648
01:05:29,633 --> 01:05:31,234
...but because of me.

649
01:05:47,666 --> 01:05:51,269
Come, Nilesh. Did you have
food? - Yes

650
01:05:52,033 --> 01:05:55,936
Did daughter-in-law eat?
-Yes she also ate.

651
01:05:57,433 --> 01:05:59,468
l heard that you are not well.

652
01:06:00,199 --> 01:06:05,371
Nothing like that but iust
a feeling... Sit.

653
01:06:08,400 --> 01:06:14,038
l am very sorry that l married
like this without your permission

654
01:06:14,400 --> 01:06:19,338
Hence...- Your marriage should
be held as per your wish only

655
01:06:24,633 --> 01:06:27,235
l know Suiata for quite some
time, father.

656
01:06:28,133 --> 01:06:32,070
She is the daughter of
our music teacher

657
01:06:32,866 --> 01:06:38,071
My teacher suddenly died and l
had to marry urgently but..

658
01:06:38,133 --> 01:06:43,505
...l wished to marry
with your permission.

659
01:06:48,933 --> 01:06:52,202
Every man has this right to
make his life in his own...

660
01:06:52,266 --> 01:06:56,403
...way and live as he wishes
like the way l live

661
01:07:04,300 --> 01:07:05,968
l never caught hold of anyone's
hand for support

662
01:07:07,033 --> 01:07:10,970
l am happy that my son has
grown so big today that...

663
01:07:11,033 --> 01:07:13,468
...he does not need my support
any more

664
01:07:15,466 --> 01:07:20,237
You make your own house where
you can live as you wish...

665
01:07:21,066 --> 01:07:25,537
...like l have made my house
and live as per my rules

666
01:07:28,533 --> 01:07:31,302
l don't allow any second person's
wish to be carried out here

667
01:07:36,966 --> 01:07:40,669
Yes, there are some duties
between a father and a son

668
01:07:41,433 --> 01:07:46,471
You will also fulfil your duties
and l will also do the same

669
01:07:49,666 --> 01:07:51,467
l have taken out these 50000
rupees for you.

670
01:07:53,400 --> 01:07:57,137
You start your life with this
money in your own way...

671
01:07:58,433 --> 01:08:02,069
...where there won't be any
interference from my side.

672
01:08:05,633 --> 01:08:10,904
lf you feel this is less, the
Iocker is open.

673
01:08:10,966 --> 01:08:13,501
You take any amount you want.
It's not necessary to ask me.

674
01:08:40,966 --> 01:08:43,134
That was the last meeting
between father and son

675
01:08:43,199 --> 01:08:46,403
They never met each other
after that and...

676
01:08:46,466 --> 01:08:49,669
...never enquired about
each other

677
01:08:50,666 --> 01:08:52,467
Seventeen years passed,
Masterji and...

678
01:08:52,533 --> 01:08:59,473
...one day, when Sir returned
from the city, there was...

679
01:08:59,533 --> 01:09:01,601
...one letter from young master
amongst his other letters.

680
01:09:02,399 --> 01:09:05,503
He read it & went out way he
came in and when he returned...

681
01:09:05,566 --> 01:09:10,103
...after 3 days, he came with
all the children and...

682
01:09:10,166 --> 01:09:16,505
...what to say about the poor
condition of the children then.

683
01:09:16,566 --> 01:09:20,336
Sir did take care of all of them.
But Ramadidi's anger is also...

684
01:09:20,399 --> 01:09:24,504
...ancestral & much more than
her grandfather's.

685
01:09:25,466 --> 01:09:28,502
One night, she was going out
with all the children.

686
01:09:29,233 --> 01:09:32,603
But sir caught all of them and
brought them into the house.

687
01:09:33,500 --> 01:09:36,436
He called Satidevi from the city
and all of them are forbidden...

688
01:09:36,500 --> 01:09:38,969
...to go out of the house.
Nobody can go out of the bridge.

689
01:09:39,033 --> 01:09:42,603
Music & laughter is banned
in this house from then.

690
01:09:43,233 --> 01:09:46,536
Young master's room has been
Iocked and no one can go in.

691
01:09:47,133 --> 01:09:50,469
But these children are such a
nuisance that inspite of all...

692
01:09:50,533 --> 01:09:52,368
...this discipline, they are
not ready to reform.

693
01:09:52,899 --> 01:09:56,270
So many masters have come and
gone. The last master ran...

694
01:09:56,333 --> 01:09:59,202
...away at night in his lungi
only without his other clothes

695
01:09:59,433 --> 01:10:01,902
Now l only wear his clothes...

696
01:10:05,066 --> 01:10:08,536
Narain, you won't get my
clothes & l'll take them along

697
01:10:09,433 --> 01:10:12,335
Your case is different
-Why?

698
01:10:12,666 --> 01:10:18,471
Your clothes will be sent
to your uncle.- Is that so?

699
01:10:18,533 --> 01:10:21,469
l will go now as it is very late.
l have to wake up early...

700
01:10:21,533 --> 01:10:24,636
...as sir is going to the city
tomorrow.-Why?

701
01:10:25,533 --> 01:10:29,970
He goes often for his business.
Satidevi is also going. - Why?

702
01:10:30,399 --> 01:10:32,668
Her house is there only. She
has to take care of her house

703
01:10:33,966 --> 01:10:35,434
l will go now- Ok

704
01:10:39,300 --> 01:10:42,536
Diwanii, have you kept all the
important papers -Yes

705
01:10:45,033 --> 01:10:50,471
Ravi, l may return from the city
in a week or it might take...

706
01:10:50,533 --> 01:10:56,405
...10-15 days. Sati is coming
with me. She has her own house.

707
01:10:56,466 --> 01:10:58,568
l had called her to look after
the children here.

708
01:10:59,500 --> 01:11:00,567
How long can she stay here?

709
01:11:01,199 --> 01:11:05,571
You can understand the big
responsibility l'm giving to...

710
01:11:05,633 --> 01:11:07,368
...to you and going

711
01:11:07,966 --> 01:11:13,237
Yes, l can understand the exam
you are leaving me to write.

712
01:11:14,000 --> 01:11:17,036
Hope you won't be disappointed.
-l also hope for that.

713
01:11:17,399 --> 01:11:21,570
l should not hear that on
returning, that U've run away.

714
01:11:22,166 --> 01:11:25,135
And ask Diwanii if you have any
requirement as l have told him

715
01:11:25,199 --> 01:11:27,302
You won't have any problem
for anything

716
01:11:28,000 --> 01:11:29,101
You will get whatever
you want.

717
01:11:29,500 --> 01:11:32,002
l will go now as it is time
for my class

718
01:11:32,666 --> 01:11:35,869
Diwanii, keep the things in the
vehicle. -Yes - Come Sati

719
01:12:07,866 --> 01:12:10,868
Masterii - Come in, Diwanii
-What is it?

720
01:12:11,066 --> 01:12:14,436
Don't the children have class
today?- No

721
01:12:15,233 --> 01:12:17,101
l have given holiday to the
children today.

722
01:12:17,633 --> 01:12:19,634
Soon after Rai Saheb has left.
-Yes

723
01:12:20,500 --> 01:12:23,336
l have written some book names
here. Please get them.

724
01:12:24,133 --> 01:12:26,435
Also get a carrom set and
things for playing cricket

725
01:12:27,133 --> 01:12:32,171
What are you saying?
-l've written what l'm saying

726
01:12:32,533 --> 01:12:34,167
But if Rai Saheb comes
then...

727
01:12:34,566 --> 01:12:37,535
U show him this paper & say
that l had asked for these.

728
01:12:39,366 --> 01:12:42,535
l don't understand, what
you are doing -Nothing...

729
01:12:43,433 --> 01:12:44,967
You get these things
before tomorrow morning.

730
01:12:45,500 --> 01:12:56,377
You, masterii, where are
your students?

731
01:12:57,166 --> 01:13:00,402
l have given them leave today
-l'm saved -Why?

732
01:13:00,933 --> 01:13:04,069
lf they come, l am dead. l have
to clean this room without...

733
01:13:04,133 --> 01:13:08,437
...their knowledge.
-Whose room is this?

734
01:13:08,899 --> 01:13:12,069
Young master's -Nilesh's
-Yes - Open it, l want to see

735
01:13:12,133 --> 01:13:13,901
No, if someone comes it will
be a problem.

736
01:13:14,166 --> 01:13:15,467
Don't worry, l will close it
afterwards.

737
01:13:17,933 --> 01:13:20,535
lf something happens, you
take care. l don't know anything

738
01:15:49,566 --> 01:15:51,367
When did you all come?

739
01:15:52,466 --> 01:15:56,002
You play the Sitar very well.
-Sister plays it better than you

740
01:15:56,566 --> 01:16:00,469
ls it so? Tell your sister to
play it for me.

741
01:16:01,266 --> 01:16:06,004
First time, l have heard music in
this house.

742
01:16:06,399 --> 01:16:09,269
Are'nt you scared of
grandfather?

743
01:16:10,066 --> 01:16:11,233
But old man is not there...

744
01:16:11,600 --> 01:16:15,537
Not old man but grandfather.
How many times have l told U?

745
01:16:16,166 --> 01:16:20,904
Wicked man -Saniu, where did
you learn this abuse?

746
01:16:21,533 --> 01:16:22,533
From the watchman...

747
01:16:23,266 --> 01:16:25,968
Where did you all go today
Ieaving the classroom?

748
01:16:26,433 --> 01:16:30,603
Did'nt they come to class today
to study?

749
01:16:31,533 --> 01:16:34,636
Grandfather went to the city and
hence we went to play.

750
01:16:35,233 --> 01:16:37,368
Then, why did'nt you tell me that
you are going to play.

751
01:16:38,100 --> 01:16:40,035
What did you play?
-Gilli-Danda(With sticks)

752
01:16:40,433 --> 01:16:42,601
lnside the house! If any glass
had broken, then...

753
01:16:43,399 --> 01:16:45,268
Your window glass is already
broken.

754
01:16:46,966 --> 01:16:49,902
Very bad. If you want to play,
you should go outside to play

755
01:16:50,533 --> 01:16:51,934
Nobody allows us to go.

756
01:16:54,000 --> 01:16:57,503
Come, l will take you outside
-Will you take us out?

757
01:16:58,433 --> 01:17:00,601
Definitely, why not?
-lf you don't come, then see...

758
01:17:04,266 --> 01:17:06,267
Let us go. -You also come,
sister- No, you all go.

759
01:17:06,933 --> 01:17:10,970
No way, nobody will go that way
-You also come, sister

760
01:17:35,399 --> 01:17:40,004
Everyone went out to
sing with the ga ma

761
01:17:48,633 --> 01:17:52,269
Father is not there, but
they've a sister like a queen...

762
01:17:52,333 --> 01:17:55,335
...everyone is with the sister

763
01:18:02,899 --> 01:18:03,367
You all also sing

764
01:18:09,366 --> 01:18:11,101
Not like this, sing
with the words

765
01:18:11,866 --> 01:18:19,907
All of us went out singing...
Father is not there.

766
01:18:20,600 --> 01:18:24,503
We went with our sister who
is like the queen

767
01:18:45,566 --> 01:18:51,238
The morning rises with sa
and removes the darkness

768
01:18:51,300 --> 01:18:58,140
Then the rays of the sun gave
Iots if light with re

769
01:18:59,300 --> 01:19:04,938
The morning rises with sa
and removes the darkness

770
01:19:05,000 --> 01:19:11,673
Then the rays of the sun gave
Iots if light with re

771
01:19:18,066 --> 01:19:18,900
You also sing, Rama

772
01:19:19,966 --> 01:19:25,171
Everyone went on singing on
the bright rays of the sun

773
01:19:59,533 --> 01:20:05,639
From the ga & ma, come
our tune and the song which...

774
01:20:05,866 --> 01:20:08,368
...moves everything and a prayer
has come with pa

775
01:20:11,633 --> 01:20:14,202
Do you know what
l am singing?

776
01:20:15,399 --> 01:20:17,168
Can't l understand even
this much?

777
01:20:17,933 --> 01:20:19,167
You were teaching them
sargam

778
01:20:19,666 --> 01:20:23,169
l was not teaching you as you
must've learnt from Ur father.

779
01:20:23,966 --> 01:20:29,204
Then till what did we reach?
-Till Pancham - How?

780
01:20:29,466 --> 01:20:31,501
Sing it...

781
01:20:46,366 --> 01:20:56,142
From the ga & ma, come
our tune and the song which...

782
01:20:56,199 --> 01:20:59,036
...moves everything and a prayer
has come with pa

783
01:21:20,266 --> 01:21:25,504
We all sang like the bee
on a flower

784
01:22:08,466 --> 01:22:14,205
The sun is pleasant with
dha...

785
01:22:14,266 --> 01:22:17,569
...and sky looks blue &
intoxicating

786
01:22:25,433 --> 01:22:28,335
The sargam (swaras) has
been completed.

787
01:22:28,399 --> 01:22:31,302
What is ahead now?

788
01:22:52,366 --> 01:22:56,603
The companions of sargam
went on singing in tune

789
01:23:05,866 --> 01:23:12,038
Father is not there and everyone
is with the queen-like sister

790
01:23:13,233 --> 01:23:17,036
We went on singing...

791
01:23:33,500 --> 01:23:36,636
You have got this new habit of
eating on the table.

792
01:23:36,866 --> 01:23:39,602
The British have gone but have
Ieft his table for you.

793
01:23:40,300 --> 01:23:42,001
They have left me for you.
If they had taken me...

794
01:23:42,066 --> 01:23:45,335
...you would have kept on
waiting for me.

795
01:23:46,333 --> 01:23:47,667
Don't know who has come now

796
01:23:49,466 --> 01:23:50,667
Wait, l am coming.

797
01:23:55,500 --> 01:23:59,470
Ravi, have you forgotten
your aunty?

798
01:24:00,300 --> 01:24:01,134
l could'nt come for so many days
but have brought my whole...

799
01:24:01,199 --> 01:24:02,067
...school with me.

800
01:24:03,233 --> 01:24:04,267
This is Rama. Fall at Aunty's
feet - Salutations...

801
01:24:04,333 --> 01:24:06,635
May you live long, daughter
Come inside.

802
01:24:07,399 --> 01:24:10,636
Aunty, bless me- May U live
Iong. U're also falling at feet

803
01:24:10,866 --> 01:24:13,602
All of you come in.
Hey, bhai...

804
01:24:14,433 --> 01:24:18,503
What happened?
-Uncle is calling aunty as...

805
01:24:18,566 --> 01:24:22,236
...bhai (brother). How can ladies
be brothers?

806
01:24:22,933 --> 01:24:27,337
Yes, she is my sister only. See
how our faces match each other

807
01:24:27,633 --> 01:24:33,572
ls'nt it? Tell us what all are
matching in our faces.

808
01:24:34,333 --> 01:24:37,569
The hair of both of you is white
-You don't have hair

809
01:24:38,366 --> 01:24:41,469
Come in. They are
very naughty.

810
01:24:44,500 --> 01:24:45,167
Sit here, daughter

811
01:24:51,933 --> 01:24:54,969
Who plays that Sitar?
-He can't even hear...

812
01:24:55,033 --> 01:24:56,667
...properly, what he will
play the Sitar.

813
01:24:57,399 --> 01:24:58,601
l used to play that Sitar.

814
01:24:59,433 --> 01:25:03,136
Ravi, l will make arrangements
for their food.

815
01:25:03,533 --> 01:25:06,068
They must be hungry
-We ate and came

816
01:25:06,133 --> 01:25:07,968
When did we eat?
l am feeling hungry

817
01:25:08,399 --> 01:25:11,569
l will make food then
-Let us eat then.

818
01:25:11,633 --> 01:25:15,136
Where are you getting up?
l have to make the food

819
01:25:17,899 --> 01:25:19,268
l will iust come.

820
01:25:23,033 --> 01:25:26,002
When is Rai Saheb coming?
-ln 5-6 days.

821
01:25:26,466 --> 01:25:29,168
But how did you know that he
has gone out of the city?

822
01:25:29,600 --> 01:25:32,135
l could understand that after
seeing these children here

823
01:25:32,866 --> 01:25:36,603
Uncle, you were unnecessarily
spoiling the name of these...

824
01:25:36,666 --> 01:25:41,203
...children.-Did l say it? Your
aunty was only against them.

825
01:25:41,933 --> 01:25:43,434
They are such cute children
that...

826
01:25:48,566 --> 01:25:51,302
Very lovely children, they
never trouble any time

827
01:25:52,100 --> 01:25:53,935
Rama, what are you
doing here?

828
01:25:54,533 --> 01:25:56,501
What is Rama doing
there?

829
01:25:58,133 --> 01:26:00,301
No, daughter, l will make
the food just now

830
01:26:01,166 --> 01:26:04,435
What is it, aunty?- You
only advise her

831
01:26:05,433 --> 01:26:06,867
You think that l don't know how
to make food

832
01:26:07,466 --> 01:26:10,068
When father was there, l used
to make the food for the entire...

833
01:26:10,133 --> 01:26:12,101
...family. There were no servants
in our house.

834
01:26:12,500 --> 01:26:15,970
You only tell her-l can only say
that both of you leave it.

835
01:26:16,133 --> 01:26:17,133
l will only knead the flour

836
01:26:18,033 --> 01:26:19,234
You have come with the shoes
into the kitchen

837
01:26:21,199 --> 01:26:24,369
You also seem to be a Brahmin
like my aunty

838
01:26:24,966 --> 01:26:27,568
You go and sit inside.

839
01:26:28,100 --> 01:26:32,471
Did you see, aunty? She came
for fire & took over the kitchen

840
01:26:33,233 --> 01:26:36,135
From my side, let her take
control of the whole house

841
01:27:01,033 --> 01:27:02,000
Catch me, Saniu

842
01:27:13,233 --> 01:27:15,635
Tell me, Diwanii. Is there any
news from Rai Saheb?

843
01:27:18,899 --> 01:27:21,602
What is it? You are looking
upset?

844
01:27:22,033 --> 01:27:26,137
You are not doing the right thing,
Masterji. -What?

845
01:27:26,199 --> 01:27:28,702
Taking out these children
every day.

846
01:27:29,533 --> 01:27:33,603
So what? The children eat every
day, sleep well and also study.

847
01:27:34,100 --> 01:27:36,602
lf they go out to play everyday,
what is the objection to that?

848
01:27:37,633 --> 01:27:40,535
You know the obiection. How
will you answer Rai Saheb...

849
01:27:40,600 --> 01:27:42,835
...when he comes back.
-Tell me one thing, Diwanji

850
01:27:45,566 --> 01:27:48,468
Have you ever seen these
children so happy before?

851
01:27:49,100 --> 01:27:51,969
You won't know this. If you're
in my place, you will know that...

852
01:27:52,033 --> 01:27:54,668
...these children would never have
studied so sincerely before

853
01:27:55,699 --> 01:27:57,701
The books you had got for them
from the market, these...

854
01:27:57,766 --> 01:28:00,034
...children had read those books
Iong back from their sister.

855
01:28:00,666 --> 01:28:02,801
They used to trouble their
masters in their stubbornness

856
01:28:03,633 --> 01:28:07,236
Are'nt these the same children
who harassed their masters?

857
01:28:08,066 --> 01:28:09,467
They used to drive them away in
a few days.

858
01:28:09,533 --> 01:28:11,968
Do you feel the same thing
by looking at them now?

859
01:28:12,033 --> 01:28:17,238
l am not asking about the
children but for Rai Saheb.

860
01:28:19,733 --> 01:28:22,802
l have been appointed here for
the children & not for Rai Saheb

861
01:28:24,800 --> 01:28:26,801
Sir, it is only 5 minutes to 9.
You are going to be late for...

862
01:28:26,866 --> 01:28:27,700
...food today.

863
01:28:34,899 --> 01:28:36,701
How can l become late?
l have come now

864
01:28:37,600 --> 01:28:41,603
Shame! Shame! You've not
washed your face

865
01:28:42,166 --> 01:28:46,637
Still 3 minutes are left. l'll wash
my face in 2 minutes & come

866
01:29:20,266 --> 01:29:24,770
When it was late night,
the barber and that painter...

867
01:29:24,833 --> 01:29:27,869
...both of them entered the lame
spirit's house and sat inside.

868
01:29:28,699 --> 01:29:36,808
When the lame spirit came back,
he saw that the door was closed

869
01:29:37,666 --> 01:29:40,869
He said from outside who is
inside?

870
01:29:41,600 --> 01:29:46,905
The barber understood and asked
who is outside?

871
01:29:47,666 --> 01:29:48,867
l am the lame spirit

872
01:29:49,633 --> 01:29:53,903
l am a spirit and l will
eat you up.

873
01:29:54,600 --> 01:29:56,702
l am the messenger of death
and l will eat you.

874
01:29:59,199 --> 01:30:00,601
She is scared, Masterii

875
01:30:04,699 --> 01:30:07,669
What happened then, sir?
-The spirit asked him..

876
01:30:07,733 --> 01:30:11,670
...what is his sign -The barber
threw out his razor and said...

877
01:30:11,733 --> 01:30:17,672
...that see my nails.
The lame spirit thought if...

878
01:30:17,733 --> 01:30:20,135
...his nails are so big,
he must also be a big spirit

879
01:30:23,000 --> 01:30:27,003
When no reply came from
outside, the barber threw out...

880
01:30:27,066 --> 01:30:31,904
...a rope outside and said
See my hair?

881
01:30:32,699 --> 01:30:35,736
The spirit was amazed.
When there was no reply...

882
01:30:35,800 --> 01:30:39,837
...from outside, he told the spirit
to run away or said he'll spit.

883
01:30:40,733 --> 01:30:43,802
The the barber took the painter's
limestone and threw it outside

884
01:30:44,633 --> 01:30:48,670
Then spirit ran away saying
Please save me

885
01:30:52,566 --> 01:30:55,035
Tell us another story.-Will you
listen to another story?

886
01:30:55,166 --> 01:30:56,634
Not about the ghosts, sir

887
01:30:58,100 --> 01:31:00,669
l will tell the story of Baiiu
and Tansen.

888
01:31:01,500 --> 01:31:02,667
Tell us that, sir

889
01:31:03,033 --> 01:31:08,138
You must have heard that Tansen
was one of the Navratnas

890
01:31:08,199 --> 01:31:10,735
...of Akbar's Assembly. In his
period, he was a great singer.

891
01:31:11,500 --> 01:31:15,270
One day, another singer called
Baiju came in Akbar's assembly

892
01:31:16,100 --> 01:31:19,937
He said that he will compete
with Tansen.

893
01:31:20,766 --> 01:31:23,068
The whole assembly gathered

894
01:31:23,733 --> 01:31:27,203
Then in a garden two seats of
marble were put and on one...

895
01:31:27,266 --> 01:31:29,468
...Tansen sat and on another
Baiju sat.

896
01:31:30,166 --> 01:31:34,036
Now Tansen started singing.
As soon as he started...

897
01:31:34,100 --> 01:31:37,269
...singing all the birds nearby
gathered there

898
01:31:37,966 --> 01:31:40,868
Tansen took out golden
chains from his pocket and...

899
01:31:40,933 --> 01:31:43,568
...put it in the necks of
all deers.

900
01:31:44,233 --> 01:31:46,735
As soon as the song finished,
all the deers ran away.

901
01:31:47,466 --> 01:31:52,003
Then Tansen told Baiiu you get
all my chains back now

902
01:31:52,866 --> 01:31:55,935
Baiiu started singing

903
01:31:56,000 --> 01:31:58,669
As soon as he started singing,
all the birds which had gone...

904
01:31:58,733 --> 01:32:01,902
...came back. Baiiu removed the
golden chains from their necks...

905
01:32:01,966 --> 01:32:04,535
...while singing and gave it
back to Tansen.

906
01:32:04,600 --> 01:32:08,971
Now it was Baiiu's chance.
He sang a Rag in such a...

907
01:32:09,033 --> 01:32:13,036
...way that the marble on which
he was sitting started melting

908
01:32:13,833 --> 01:32:16,602
Baiiu went on singing and the
marble went on melting...

909
01:32:16,666 --> 01:32:18,267
...so much that Baiiu was
getting stuck in that.

910
01:32:19,166 --> 01:32:20,867
Seeing that, all the people
started shouting, and Baiju's...

911
01:32:20,933 --> 01:32:25,804
...concentration was broken and
he stopped singing.

912
01:32:26,199 --> 01:32:28,869
As soon as he did that, the
marble joined again and Baiju...

913
01:32:28,933 --> 01:32:35,072
...was stuck there. He told
Tansen to sing and remove him...

914
01:32:35,133 --> 01:32:37,235
...from there. Tansen was
scared.

915
01:32:40,633 --> 01:32:43,669
All of them have slept.

916
01:32:44,166 --> 01:32:46,468
Did Tansen take out Baiiu
afterwards?

917
01:32:54,066 --> 01:32:56,701
l will tell the rest of the
story tomorrow.

918
01:32:58,800 --> 01:33:01,169
lt is very late.
You also go and sleep

919
01:33:04,233 --> 01:33:09,705
Listen...
-Did you say something?

920
01:33:10,666 --> 01:33:14,636
Do you address me with
respect as l had told you with...

921
01:33:14,699 --> 01:33:18,503
...anger that day
-lt is good to show respect

922
01:33:20,500 --> 01:33:23,169
No, you don't address me with
respect now.

923
01:33:23,766 --> 01:33:26,668
Then how do l call you?
-l already said that

924
01:33:27,199 --> 01:33:33,639
Ok, then... good night
-Good night...

925
01:33:57,500 --> 01:33:59,134
Who is inside?

926
01:34:12,600 --> 01:34:14,001
Who is there inside?

927
01:34:14,766 --> 01:34:17,034
Who is there outside?

928
01:34:18,233 --> 01:34:20,501
l am the lame spirit.

929
01:34:21,566 --> 01:34:26,671
What is this lame spirit doing
here in the morning?

930
01:34:27,466 --> 01:34:30,202
How is your hand?
-lt is ok. Why?

931
01:34:30,966 --> 01:34:33,935
Sister has sent this balm
and told you to massage with it

932
01:34:37,766 --> 01:34:39,801
Go and thank your sister
from my side

933
01:34:47,500 --> 01:34:49,935
You are laughing so loudly.
What if your salary is cut?

934
01:34:50,666 --> 01:34:53,735
You have done great magic.
Now the children study...

935
01:34:53,800 --> 01:35:01,607
...play and also laugh. No
one needs to go to the jungle

936
01:35:02,233 --> 01:35:04,034
But what will happen when
the Rai Saheb comes back.

937
01:35:04,666 --> 01:35:08,669
Yes, what will happen?
But there is one thing, masterji

938
01:35:09,500 --> 01:35:12,703
Sir is not a bad man but
he is very strict.

939
01:35:13,466 --> 01:35:15,768
He has left the army but
not the army life

940
01:35:16,533 --> 01:35:19,469
Was Rai Saheb like this, even
before Nilesh left the house?

941
01:35:19,933 --> 01:35:25,204
No, he was strict but he used
to joke around also then.

942
01:35:27,466 --> 01:35:30,769
That is it. He has taken that
sorrow into his heart.

943
01:35:30,833 --> 01:35:34,069
l have not seen Rai Saheb
Iaughing for last 20 years.

944
01:35:35,233 --> 01:35:38,669
Narain, by God's wish, you will
see him laughing this time.

945
01:35:42,666 --> 01:35:46,703
Yes, you iust return sir's
Iaughter to him.

946
01:35:46,766 --> 01:35:49,502
l will give you whatever
you want...

947
01:35:52,800 --> 01:35:56,970
What status do l have? But if
you ask for my life also...

948
01:36:09,566 --> 01:36:14,137
Now you'll take the white coins
& you'll take the black coins. Ok

949
01:36:14,199 --> 01:36:20,272
No, l will take the red one.
-No, you'll take the black coins

950
01:36:20,500 --> 01:36:21,734
Come on, play

951
01:36:26,199 --> 01:36:31,705
You are cheating
Very bad...

952
01:36:32,566 --> 01:36:33,633
Let us see who takes the
queen now.

953
01:36:34,666 --> 01:36:38,936
Give it here
Strike - Very good...

954
01:36:52,766 --> 01:36:55,702
You all play, l will go. You
should go to bed after 1 hour

955
01:36:56,633 --> 01:37:02,171
And no one will cheat during
play. Ok, Sanju. Play now

956
01:39:13,266 --> 01:39:17,003
What happened, Rama?
-lnsect...

957
01:39:18,066 --> 01:39:24,972
Where?- It was sitting here.
-Nothing is here

958
01:39:25,866 --> 01:39:32,138
lt was there. It was harassing
me for half-an-hour

959
01:39:33,000 --> 01:39:34,901
Who? - The insect..

960
01:39:37,066 --> 01:39:42,671
lt was really there.
Black one... See there

961
01:39:43,600 --> 01:39:46,235
Rama, you are mad.
Really mad...

962
01:39:49,600 --> 01:39:52,602
Come, dear insect...

963
01:40:01,600 --> 01:40:06,538
lt looks as if you were getting
rid of a lion

964
01:40:24,199 --> 01:40:29,672
Narain...- Come, Panditii
-Where is Ravi?

965
01:40:30,533 --> 01:40:32,935
He is teaching children
in the classroom.

966
01:40:33,966 --> 01:40:35,867
He must be coming in another
five minutes. Please sit.

967
01:40:36,866 --> 01:40:40,469
Forgive me, Panditii, let me finish
my work -Ok, do it.

968
01:40:41,266 --> 01:40:44,969
When is Rai Saheb coming back?
- In another 4-5 days...

969
01:40:45,733 --> 01:40:48,702
He has written a letter to
Diwanji, in which he has written..

970
01:40:48,766 --> 01:40:51,635
...that he will come on the 25th.
-Today is only 15th.

971
01:40:52,566 --> 01:40:55,101
Still 10 more days are left.
-That will run away this...

972
01:40:55,166 --> 01:40:58,135
...week only as time runs
very fast

973
01:40:59,866 --> 01:41:02,702
Greetings uncle
-Greetings

974
01:41:10,600 --> 01:41:13,502
ls the class over?
-Yes, we have the carrom...

975
01:41:13,566 --> 01:41:17,036
...class after half-an-hour.
-ls that so?

976
01:41:17,766 --> 01:41:20,635
Do you have classes for Carrom
also?- Go now, children

977
01:41:21,199 --> 01:41:27,839
Tell me, how you came, uncle.
-You got a letter

978
01:41:42,000 --> 01:41:44,535
Whose letter is it?
-Amit's

979
01:41:45,899 --> 01:41:50,738
What has he written?
-l have got that job, uncle

980
01:41:51,166 --> 01:41:52,767
l have to ioin duty within
two days.

981
01:41:53,566 --> 01:41:56,669
Where?- A nice company and the
job is also very good.

982
01:41:57,533 --> 01:42:00,636
l had given the interview before
coming. This is Mr. Dixit's help

983
01:42:03,199 --> 01:42:06,870
When do you have to reach?
-On the 18th

984
01:42:07,633 --> 01:42:11,670
That means after two days
-_ es

985
01:42:12,600 --> 01:42:14,668
How will you go so early?
What will happen here?

986
01:42:16,000 --> 01:42:18,769
That is the problem as Rai
Saheb is also not there...

987
01:42:18,833 --> 01:42:20,634
And what will happen to
the children

988
01:42:20,899 --> 01:42:24,036
But it won't be good to lose
this job, uncle

989
01:42:24,800 --> 01:42:28,136
How long will l have work here?
Children won't be home for long

990
01:42:29,033 --> 01:42:29,867
They also have to be sent
to school.

991
01:42:30,566 --> 01:42:34,636
That is right but l feel,
you should not decide before...

992
01:42:34,699 --> 01:42:36,635
...Rai Saheb comes.

993
01:42:39,866 --> 01:42:45,204
l will go then as l have to
go to Mr. Gani's house too

994
01:42:47,133 --> 01:42:49,702
Come someday to the house
with Rama as your aunty...

995
01:42:49,766 --> 01:42:51,767
...was asking about her.

996
01:42:51,833 --> 01:43:09,850
The nights are not
being spent easily...

997
01:43:09,899 --> 01:43:17,774
...these nights are filled
with separation

998
01:43:36,066 --> 01:43:39,269
What happened? Sing
without stopping...

999
01:43:42,533 --> 01:43:44,668
l can't sing before you
-Why?

1000
01:43:45,600 --> 01:43:48,703
l am not so out of tune that l
can't appreciate a good song.

1001
01:43:49,600 --> 01:43:52,803
No, l only sing out of
tune...

1002
01:43:53,633 --> 01:43:55,468
But it does not seem like that
on hearing

1003
01:43:56,199 --> 01:43:58,468
Who is your teacher?
-My father

1004
01:43:59,100 --> 01:44:03,537
Father is the teacher.
Let us see what you're singing

1005
01:44:05,466 --> 01:44:06,667
This is father's note book

1006
01:44:08,766 --> 01:44:09,800
ls this your mother?

1007
01:44:10,600 --> 01:44:14,971
This was my father's last song
which l learnt from him.

1008
01:44:15,733 --> 01:44:19,870
Mother was also not alive then
and she had died 3 yrs before

1009
01:44:20,666 --> 01:44:23,468
And father also used to remain
very sick.

1010
01:44:31,066 --> 01:44:35,870
The nights are not
being spent easily...

1011
01:44:35,933 --> 01:44:40,170
...these nights are filled
with separation

1012
01:44:52,800 --> 01:45:02,743
The wet eyes tried a lot to
extinguish the night

1013
01:45:03,533 --> 01:45:07,203
The nights are not
being spent easily...

1014
01:45:07,266 --> 01:45:12,838
...these nights are filled
with separation

1015
01:45:13,600 --> 01:45:22,842
The wet eyes tried a lot to
extinguish the night

1016
01:45:43,066 --> 01:45:53,242
Somebody is reminding us
of the talk of the past

1017
01:45:54,033 --> 01:46:03,275
Someone is calling by
the forgotten names

1018
01:46:24,500 --> 01:46:25,667
The moon...

1019
01:46:34,800 --> 01:46:41,740
The nights of the full moon
and the stars...

1020
01:46:45,000 --> 01:46:54,175
The night is not setting in
the eyes that are awake

1021
01:47:39,133 --> 01:47:48,675
The ages come
and go by

1022
01:47:48,733 --> 01:47:58,709
But moments of the small
memories do not go away...

1023
01:47:59,633 --> 01:48:08,608
The ages come
and go by

1024
01:48:09,533 --> 01:48:17,474
But moments of the small
memories....- do not go away...

1025
01:48:20,766 --> 01:48:28,573
The nights are looking black
due to our sorrow

1026
01:48:29,533 --> 01:48:38,108
The tearful eyes tried a lot
to pacify the night

1027
01:48:38,166 --> 01:48:43,170
The nights are not
being spent easily...

1028
01:48:43,233 --> 01:48:48,605
...these nights are filled
with separation

1029
01:48:49,466 --> 01:48:59,242
The wet eyes tried a lot to
extinguish the night

1030
01:49:15,966 --> 01:49:19,102
Father...are you having
Iot of difficulty.

1031
01:49:24,800 --> 01:49:27,969
Shall l call the doctor
uncle?

1032
01:49:50,600 --> 01:49:53,803
Respected father, it is 17
years since l left your house...

1033
01:49:53,866 --> 01:49:57,035
...or shall l say, after
having my own house

1034
01:49:57,100 --> 01:50:00,803
l have lived in my own way
till now as you have said.

1035
01:50:01,533 --> 01:50:04,869
But today l have been compelled
to take this favour not for...

1036
01:50:04,933 --> 01:50:09,037
...myself but for my five
children who are small.

1037
01:50:09,833 --> 01:50:10,700
Please take care of them.

1038
01:50:21,800 --> 01:50:25,770
Aiay, -Yes, father
-Come here

1039
01:50:30,699 --> 01:50:33,235
Post this letter.

1040
01:50:34,033 --> 01:50:37,703
Where were you roaming
in the rains?

1041
01:50:38,666 --> 01:50:39,466
Rains have stopped

1042
01:50:39,533 --> 01:50:43,637
This is the money for
the stamps

1043
01:50:48,800 --> 01:50:49,767
Where are you going?

1044
01:50:49,833 --> 01:50:51,701
To post this letter which
father gave.

1045
01:50:51,766 --> 01:50:57,805
Give it to me now as
l am getting late.-Ajay...

1046
01:51:01,566 --> 01:51:04,101
How was your health yesterday
night? You don't take...

1047
01:51:04,166 --> 01:51:05,066
...your treatment also properly.
-Father..

1048
01:51:07,233 --> 01:51:09,635
Have you written a letter
to grandfather?

1049
01:51:10,066 --> 01:51:14,203
Yes, l have written to him to
come and take you all. - Why?

1050
01:51:14,899 --> 01:51:21,740
You make spinach very well.
He also likes it a lot

1051
01:51:22,566 --> 01:51:25,168
You make & give that to him
-Don't joke and tell the truth

1052
01:51:27,866 --> 01:51:30,702
Your nature is also iust
like your grandfather's.

1053
01:51:30,766 --> 01:51:34,803
You will fit there-What've you
written in the letter?

1054
01:51:34,866 --> 01:51:36,801
Have you asked for money?

1055
01:51:39,666 --> 01:51:44,604
No, your father will never
do that.

1056
01:51:45,633 --> 01:51:47,968
Even while dying, he will...

1057
01:51:51,033 --> 01:51:55,504
Then why did you write? Do you
remember, how you scolded...

1058
01:51:55,566 --> 01:51:57,200
...mother, when she asked you
OnCe.

1059
01:51:59,800 --> 01:52:04,137
Go, daughter. Bring tea for
your doctor uncle.

1060
01:52:07,933 --> 01:52:13,271
Are the tablets over?

1061
01:52:17,066 --> 01:52:18,967
The breathing is over

1062
01:52:20,800 --> 01:52:23,269
How can treatment go on like
this?

1063
01:52:23,933 --> 01:52:26,702
How many times, l have told you
to get admitted in the hospital

1064
01:52:28,500 --> 01:52:35,173
l know. That is why, l have
written to father today

1065
01:52:36,600 --> 01:52:39,769
Otherwise, where will l
Ieave these children.

1066
01:52:41,166 --> 01:52:48,840
See this, l spit blood ten
times in a day now

1067
01:53:22,266 --> 01:53:27,504
The same day, we took father to
the hospital but it was too late

1068
01:53:28,166 --> 01:53:30,601
His end could be seen very
clearly in front of us.

1069
01:53:33,033 --> 01:53:35,135
Father used to keep asking
about grandfather

1070
01:53:35,933 --> 01:53:37,801
Neither he came nor
his letter

1071
01:53:38,899 --> 01:53:41,502
But l know, grandfather did not
come deliberately.

1072
01:53:42,800 --> 01:53:45,169
Due to his pride and
stubbornness

1073
01:53:47,699 --> 01:53:51,637
But when everything was over,
he came to take us

1074
01:53:52,533 --> 01:53:54,668
lf father had not taken promise
from me in his last moments...

1075
01:53:54,733 --> 01:53:58,069
...l would have never
come here.

1076
01:54:03,066 --> 01:54:08,171
Rama, l am not blaming anyone.
But the truth is, everyone...

1077
01:54:08,233 --> 01:54:09,934
...erred in understanding
Rai Saheb

1078
01:54:11,233 --> 01:54:15,670
You as well as your father...

1079
01:54:17,800 --> 01:54:21,637
You think that, Rai Saheb did not
enquire about his son deliberately

1080
01:54:22,600 --> 01:54:26,003
But he was actually waiting for
his letter for 17 years.

1081
01:54:27,500 --> 01:54:28,601
lf he had written even once, he
would have gone himself...

1082
01:54:28,666 --> 01:54:31,468
...and brought him here.

1083
01:54:32,233 --> 01:54:34,602
How do you know?
Who told you this?

1084
01:54:35,466 --> 01:54:39,102
Rai Saheb himself told me-Why
did'nt he pacify father then?

1085
01:54:39,199 --> 01:54:41,936
Where will he go to pacify him?
Where will he write to him?

1086
01:54:42,000 --> 01:54:44,469
Your father had not given
any news to him

1087
01:54:46,699 --> 01:54:49,936
Why did'nt he come, when
father wrote to him?

1088
01:54:50,199 --> 01:54:54,804
See Rama, you have decided this
yourself about Rai Saheb.

1089
01:54:55,100 --> 01:54:58,703
Have you ever asked him,
why he did not come?

1090
01:54:59,833 --> 01:55:02,502
Why should l ask?
-Then why would he tell you

1091
01:55:02,566 --> 01:55:05,969
He had to answer his son
and not to you.

1092
01:55:08,866 --> 01:55:12,669
Listen, l will tell you.
When your father's letter came...

1093
01:55:12,733 --> 01:55:15,569
...Rai Saheb was not here and
had gone out of station.

1094
01:55:15,633 --> 01:55:17,935
He got that letter after
a month.

1095
01:55:18,033 --> 01:55:21,569
As soon as he got that letter,
he came without delaying a...

1096
01:55:21,699 --> 01:55:22,901
...single moment to meet his son

1097
01:55:24,666 --> 01:55:25,833
How do you know?

1098
01:55:25,966 --> 01:55:29,269
Again the same question?
He was with you for two...

1099
01:55:29,533 --> 01:55:33,737
...days trying to pacify you to
come with him

1100
01:55:33,800 --> 01:55:37,069
He was sleeping and living in the
same clothes for two days.

1101
01:55:37,133 --> 01:55:39,802
He did'nt have any clothes to
change also. Did U forget that?

1102
01:55:39,866 --> 01:55:44,470
What pride did he have that time
to plead to small children...

1103
01:55:44,600 --> 01:55:51,707
...requesting and begging
them to come with him

1104
01:56:23,800 --> 01:56:30,039
Sir...-Who has got this?
-Masterji - For what?

1105
01:56:31,100 --> 01:56:36,939
So that children can play.
-Where is Ravi?-He has gone

1106
01:56:40,033 --> 01:56:43,102
He has gone to the city.
He was saying...- Shut up...

1107
01:56:43,966 --> 01:56:48,136
Where is Diwanii?-He has gone
outside.-Call him...

1108
01:56:48,266 --> 01:56:50,001
l'll call him - Wait...

1109
01:56:57,966 --> 01:57:01,002
Who has put this photo here?
-The children...

1110
01:57:01,166 --> 01:57:03,067
Where are the children?
- In the school...

1111
01:57:03,133 --> 01:57:07,971
Which school? - Where they will
study, sir - In the classroom

1112
01:57:08,133 --> 01:57:10,268
What are they doing there?
-Studying, sir

1113
01:57:10,600 --> 01:57:13,869
Studying! -They study till
1 O'clock

1114
01:57:13,933 --> 01:57:17,503
Who is teaching them?
-Sister Rama

1115
01:57:44,100 --> 01:57:52,475
Greetings, grandfather
-Greetings, grandfather

1116
01:57:52,800 --> 01:57:59,473
When did you come?
-Just some time back...

1117
01:58:01,566 --> 01:58:06,070
Salutations at your feet,
grandfather- Bless you, son

1118
01:58:10,800 --> 01:58:16,639
Has aunty come? -No, she will
stay at her house now

1119
01:58:16,833 --> 01:58:19,468
You all sit and study.

1120
01:59:10,000 --> 01:59:12,836
Grandfather, have this
spinach vegetable

1121
01:59:18,933 --> 01:59:21,902
l have prepared this as
you like it a lot.

1122
01:59:21,966 --> 01:59:26,937
Father had told us once.
-Did Neelu tell you this?

1123
01:59:28,833 --> 01:59:33,871
Did he used to remember me?
-Yes & talked a lot about you

1124
01:59:34,933 --> 01:59:39,871
Did he say that l am very
stone-hearted?

1125
01:59:40,000 --> 01:59:42,602
l have done lot of attrociites
on him.- No, grandfather

1126
01:59:42,733 --> 01:59:47,838
He used to say that he has
never seen anyone else who...

1127
01:59:47,933 --> 01:59:53,471
...stands on his principles
like his father, in his life

1128
02:00:18,666 --> 02:00:21,168
Who is it?
Come inside

1129
02:00:22,800 --> 02:00:27,671
Good night, grandfather
-Good night, grandfather

1130
02:00:27,866 --> 02:00:32,070
Why are you standing outside?
Come inside

1131
02:00:33,166 --> 02:00:36,502
Saniu, who taught you to
say goodnight - Masterji..

1132
02:00:36,866 --> 02:00:42,638
Will you stay with me here?
-l'll also stay here, grandfather

1133
02:00:42,733 --> 02:00:45,602
l will also stay here
-Both of you stay here only

1134
02:00:45,699 --> 02:00:48,035
Grandfather, do you know
stories?

1135
02:00:48,100 --> 02:00:51,503
Which story? - The story
of the lame spirit...

1136
02:00:51,633 --> 02:00:53,801
No...-l know the story
-Tell me then

1137
02:00:53,866 --> 02:00:59,738
One lame spirit was there who
asked who is inside

1138
02:00:59,866 --> 02:01:04,804
l am the lame spirit.
l will eat youup.

1139
02:01:23,933 --> 02:01:25,734
Come inside, daughter

1140
02:01:30,199 --> 02:01:34,537
Who told these stories to them?
Was it Ravi?- Yes

1141
02:01:35,033 --> 02:01:37,135
Did Ravi say anything and go?

1142
02:01:37,566 --> 02:01:39,968
He said that he has got
a good job in the city and...

1143
02:01:40,033 --> 02:01:41,901
...it was necessary for him
to go.

1144
02:01:42,166 --> 02:01:44,801
l am very thankful to Ravi
as he has introduced...

1145
02:01:44,866 --> 02:01:46,834
...my grandchildren to me.

1146
02:01:49,033 --> 02:01:51,135
But one thing l did'nt like
about him

1147
02:01:52,666 --> 02:01:55,101
He left without telling me
in my absence.

1148
02:01:55,199 --> 02:01:57,168
He has not done the right
thing.

1149
02:02:00,466 --> 02:02:03,569
Grandfather is upset only about
the fact that you left...

1150
02:02:03,633 --> 02:02:05,901
...without meeting him, or else he
is very happy.

1151
02:02:05,966 --> 02:02:07,901
lt is very nice to see him
Iaughing.

1152
02:02:08,166 --> 02:02:10,668
You will be surprised to know
that Meeta sleeps with...

1153
02:02:10,733 --> 02:02:12,234
...grandfather these days.

1154
02:02:12,500 --> 02:02:16,770
Saniu is with me. Aiay and Viiay
have gone to the hostel.

1155
02:02:16,833 --> 02:02:20,002
When they were leaving for the
hostel, grandfather had tears...

1156
02:02:20,066 --> 02:02:23,469
...as he said that he has not
even lived even to his heart's...

1157
02:02:23,566 --> 02:02:25,267
...content with these children.

1158
02:02:25,533 --> 02:02:28,469
He took your name and said that
if you had been there...

1159
02:02:28,500 --> 02:02:30,935
...you would have taught them
for some more days.

1160
02:02:31,033 --> 02:02:33,268
But you must be having lots of
work there.

1161
02:02:33,533 --> 02:02:36,936
You won't have any time to meet
Sanju also.

1162
02:02:37,033 --> 02:02:39,268
Saniu and others remember
you a lot

1163
02:02:39,666 --> 02:02:44,470
Saniu and others remember you a
Iot..

1164
02:02:44,699 --> 02:02:47,903
You have read these 50 times
and l have also heard it

1165
02:02:48,133 --> 02:02:50,001
But why don't take the names
of those others.

1166
02:02:53,199 --> 02:02:57,671
Who is it?..
-What? -Who is it?

1167
02:02:57,733 --> 02:03:01,736
Rai Saheb... -then..
Ajay, Vijay... - And...

1168
02:03:01,866 --> 02:03:08,472
Narain and Diwanii -Why don't
you take Rama's name?

1169
02:03:08,766 --> 02:03:11,034
Why are you shying away
like a sacred lady?

1170
02:03:12,899 --> 02:03:16,770
Did you say anything to Rama?
-Yes...-What?

1171
02:03:16,966 --> 02:03:26,475
Only that, l will miss
her a lot - What?

1172
02:03:26,866 --> 02:03:32,171
What else then? Then should l
do drama like they do in films.

1173
02:03:32,866 --> 02:03:37,604
What did she tell you while you
were leaving??- No...

1174
02:03:37,966 --> 02:03:44,005
When l was leaving, everyone
including Sanju came out with me

1175
02:03:44,466 --> 02:03:49,871
l don't feel like going, Diwanii.
But the job is such that...

1176
02:03:49,933 --> 02:03:53,936
...l don't feel like leaving it.
Please ask for forgiveness...

1177
02:03:54,033 --> 02:03:56,769
...from Raisaheb from my side
when he comes & explain to him

1178
02:04:01,233 --> 02:04:04,469
Shall l leave, Aiay? Will you
remember, whatever l've told U?

1179
02:04:05,100 --> 02:04:07,869
Yes sir-Viiay...
-Yes sir

1180
02:04:10,800 --> 02:04:13,502
Munni...- When will you come
back, sir

1181
02:04:16,800 --> 02:04:21,905
l wil come for your marriage.
Will you call me? -No

1182
02:04:22,866 --> 02:04:27,036
Why are you going, sir?
-l have to go...

1183
02:04:27,133 --> 02:04:30,035
...as l have work
-When will you come again?

1184
02:04:31,933 --> 02:04:34,135
l will come soon, Saniu

1185
02:04:35,866 --> 02:04:39,636
Where is your sister?
-She is crying in her room.

1186
02:05:05,733 --> 02:05:10,170
Rama...-Won't you ever come
to meet grandfather?

1187
02:05:12,966 --> 02:05:16,703
l will surely come to
meet you, Rama

1188
02:05:24,866 --> 02:05:26,200
Shall l leave?

1189
02:06:07,966 --> 02:06:11,469
Ravi, l feel that you should
go and meet her

1190
02:06:12,866 --> 02:06:15,969
And talk to Rama if you can

1191
02:06:16,800 --> 02:06:19,269
What? -See now

1192
02:06:22,733 --> 02:06:24,801
Rama won't be able to speak to
Rai Saheb herself even though...

1193
02:06:25,066 --> 02:06:30,271
...she loves you -Do you think,
l can speak with Rai Saheb?

1194
02:06:31,100 --> 02:06:33,969
lf you know Rama's feelings for
sure, you can tell him.

1195
02:06:35,666 --> 02:06:38,802
lf you can't tell yourself, you can
ask your uncle to speak.

1196
02:06:39,033 --> 02:06:41,535
But that poor Rama has no
other way at all

1197
02:06:41,600 --> 02:06:44,202
She has no parents.
To whom will she tell?

1198
02:06:44,733 --> 02:06:49,237
lf you go to meet them, Rai
Saheb may understand himself

1199
02:06:53,899 --> 02:06:55,067
Come on, rise your head

1200
02:06:57,133 --> 02:06:59,068
Good, don't touch your
eyes now.

1201
02:07:00,166 --> 02:07:01,700
Wear these glasses.

1202
02:07:02,800 --> 02:07:05,536
Sheru, take the children inside as
it is very hot. Go, children

1203
02:07:09,966 --> 02:07:11,133
Greetings, Rai Saheb

1204
02:07:19,500 --> 02:07:23,270
Why have you come now?
Who called you here?

1205
02:07:24,899 --> 02:07:29,037
Nobody called me. l iust
came to meet.

1206
02:07:29,466 --> 02:07:35,071
Whom have you come to meet?
-What? -Rama or the children..

1207
02:07:35,533 --> 02:07:39,637
l have come to meet everybody.
-You've not come to meet me

1208
02:07:39,800 --> 02:07:43,136
lf you cared for me, you would
not have run away in my absence

1209
02:07:43,833 --> 02:07:49,271
l am sorry that l had to go in
your absence. But you know me.

1210
02:07:49,766 --> 02:07:53,102
And l had finished the work
you had given to me.

1211
02:07:53,233 --> 02:07:57,937
Who said that your work is
over? You just corrected the...

1212
02:07:58,133 --> 02:08:02,737
...children and the rest...
-Who are the rest?

1213
02:08:02,833 --> 02:08:05,602
Me, who will reform me.

1214
02:08:07,800 --> 02:08:09,568
You still have to correct
me.

1215
02:08:10,233 --> 02:08:12,268
Sit, Ravi
-Thank you, Rai Saheb

1216
02:08:13,033 --> 02:08:16,136
Ravi, the children have
themselves corrected me.

1217
02:08:16,666 --> 02:08:20,836
l am very happy and
grateful to you.

1218
02:08:21,000 --> 02:08:24,036
As you have made me
close to the children

1219
02:08:24,233 --> 02:08:27,569
Or else, rest of my life would
have also gone in regret.

1220
02:08:27,966 --> 02:08:30,902
And children would have only
known that their grandfather...

1221
02:08:31,033 --> 02:08:33,869
...was a tyrant.
-No, Rai Saheb

1222
02:08:34,100 --> 02:08:37,536
Happiness cannot be imprisoned
into a fist

1223
02:08:37,600 --> 02:08:40,970
You had so much love in you,
that its fragrance would have...

1224
02:08:41,066 --> 02:08:42,834
...reached the children in
some way.

1225
02:08:45,733 --> 02:08:49,036
How are Saniu and the others?
Ajay and Vijay must be...

1226
02:08:49,066 --> 02:08:50,901
...writing letters from their
hostel.

1227
02:08:51,000 --> 02:08:53,936
l get letters from them every
week...

1228
02:08:54,666 --> 02:08:57,769
But how do you know that they
have gone to the hostel.

1229
02:09:00,866 --> 02:09:03,802
Rama had written a letter.
l had told her to write to me...

1230
02:09:03,866 --> 02:09:07,669
...after U come as to how much
l had succeeded in my work.

1231
02:09:07,800 --> 02:09:11,837
Actually, you should have written
a letter congratulating me.

1232
02:09:12,033 --> 02:09:18,739
Definitely not, you should have
written to me... Leave it

1233
02:09:18,899 --> 02:09:22,270
l have lost to one son due to
my obstinancy

1234
02:09:23,133 --> 02:09:25,468
l don't want to do that
mistake again.

1235
02:09:26,966 --> 02:09:29,268
l'll tell you this news, which
might be a very happy news

1236
02:09:29,866 --> 02:09:31,734
l have a friend from
the army time

1237
02:09:32,066 --> 02:09:34,268
They are a good well-to-do
family.

1238
02:09:34,533 --> 02:09:37,736
l am talking about Rama's
marriage with his grandson.

1239
02:09:37,933 --> 02:09:40,735
She will be very comfortable
if she goes there

1240
02:09:41,633 --> 02:09:45,003
Does Rama know this?
-No...

1241
02:09:46,133 --> 02:09:50,770
l am completely broken
somewhere inside me.

1242
02:09:51,100 --> 02:09:53,235
l have become weak.

1243
02:09:53,966 --> 02:10:00,472
l don't know why l feel scared
to tell my little daughter.

1244
02:10:01,066 --> 02:10:06,971
lf she says no, l won't
be able to bear that.

1245
02:10:07,266 --> 02:10:11,203
There is no reason for
this fear.

1246
02:10:13,633 --> 02:10:18,270
Ravi, l could not conduct my
son's marriage as l wished

1247
02:10:19,000 --> 02:10:22,536
But l have a great wish to
conduct this grand daughter's...

1248
02:10:22,766 --> 02:10:24,067
...marriage in my way.

1249
02:10:27,033 --> 02:10:30,069
Maybe l want to wash away
my previous sins

1250
02:10:31,899 --> 02:10:36,971
Come, let us go to the hall, Ravi
It is very hot now

1251
02:10:37,166 --> 02:10:39,768
Where are Saniu and Meeta?
- Must be in their room.

1252
02:10:39,899 --> 02:10:42,869
Go and meet them. They will be
very happy to meet you.

1253
02:10:43,199 --> 02:10:44,501
They keep remembering you
a lot.

1254
02:11:00,600 --> 02:11:05,538
Ravi, l could not conduct my
son's marriage as l wished

1255
02:11:06,000 --> 02:11:10,003
But l have a great wish to
conduct this grand daughter's...

1256
02:11:10,100 --> 02:11:11,734
...marriage in my way.

1257
02:11:13,800 --> 02:11:17,470
Maybe l want to wash away
my previous sins

1258
02:11:22,833 --> 02:11:26,803
Somebody is remembering you and
that is why you are coughing.

1259
02:11:27,533 --> 02:11:32,271
Who will remember me, sister?
-Masterji is remembering you.

1260
02:11:32,533 --> 02:11:34,268
Why does he remember me
often?

1261
02:11:36,899 --> 02:11:41,704
He loves you and hence
remembers you often.

1262
02:11:41,899 --> 02:11:47,839
Sister, masterii loves you too.
-No, as sister did'nt cough?

1263
02:11:52,000 --> 02:11:54,168
Masterii only must be
coughing now

1264
02:12:03,699 --> 02:12:07,270
l am a wanderer, friends

1265
02:12:08,500 --> 02:12:13,104
l have no house or
place to live

1266
02:12:27,566 --> 02:12:34,806
The day held my hands
and made me sit here

1267
02:12:35,000 --> 02:12:45,110
And the night called me there
by giving a signal

1268
02:12:45,233 --> 02:12:54,875
This is my story
from day to night

1269
02:12:55,833 --> 02:12:59,002
l am a wanderer, friends

1270
02:13:00,733 --> 02:13:03,602
l have no house
or place to live

1271
02:13:04,000 --> 02:13:14,677
l have to go and
just have to keep going

1272
02:13:21,566 --> 02:13:23,501
What happened? Where are you
preparing to leave?

1273
02:13:23,666 --> 02:13:27,102
To go to the city. Uncle, l am
Ieaving by the afternoon train.

1274
02:13:27,166 --> 02:13:28,834
But, what is the hurry?
You have just come

1275
02:13:28,933 --> 02:13:33,270
You stay for 2-3 days.-No uncle,
l had told Amit and come

1276
02:13:34,566 --> 02:13:38,269
What is the matter? Why are
you looking upset - Nothing...

1277
02:13:38,600 --> 02:13:40,601
Did you meet Rai Saheb?
-_ es

1278
02:13:40,666 --> 02:13:45,704
Did you meet Rama?- Yes..
-How is Rama?

1279
02:13:49,500 --> 02:13:50,567
She is fine.

1280
02:13:55,833 --> 02:13:58,268
Where are you going?
-To the kitchen

1281
02:13:58,566 --> 02:14:00,467
Where is Ravi?
-Ravi...

1282
02:14:00,899 --> 02:14:03,469
Did'nt he meet you?
Where were you?

1283
02:14:03,566 --> 02:14:06,835
ln our rooms-He had come
there to meet you.

1284
02:14:08,600 --> 02:14:12,537
Did he come? When?
-One hour back.

1285
02:14:12,866 --> 02:14:15,835
But why did he go away without
meeting you all.

1286
02:14:19,166 --> 02:14:22,168
Rama...-Yes...
Come here...

1287
02:14:25,833 --> 02:14:27,100
Come near me.

1288
02:14:32,666 --> 02:14:33,800
Come more close.

1289
02:14:52,500 --> 02:14:55,469
l don't like your coming like this
and going away immediately

1290
02:14:55,866 --> 02:14:57,667
lt seems that you had
just come to touch this place

1291
02:15:05,833 --> 02:15:08,068
You wait...
l will just see.

1292
02:15:10,899 --> 02:15:12,801
The whistle has been given. You
get in now. Take care...

1293
02:15:12,899 --> 02:15:15,836
Keep writing letters.

1294
02:15:24,266 --> 02:15:25,600
Panditii...

1295
02:15:29,199 --> 02:15:30,267
Where is Ravi?

1296
02:15:30,833 --> 02:15:32,901
What?
-Has Ravi gone?

1297
02:15:33,033 --> 02:15:36,136
What?- l am asking you
whether Ravi has left.

1298
02:16:35,000 --> 02:16:38,169
The discretion of our old age is
that we should leave from here.
