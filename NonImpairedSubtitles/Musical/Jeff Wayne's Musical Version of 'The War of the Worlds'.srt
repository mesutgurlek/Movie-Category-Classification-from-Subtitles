00:00:17,419 --> 00:00:21,703
Jeff Wayne's Musical Version
of H.G. Wells

2
00:00:24,277 --> 00:00:27,238
THE WAR OF THE WORLDS

3
00:01:52,060 --> 00:01:54,826
Mars is incapable of sustaining life.

4
00:01:55,311 --> 00:01:58,550
Our efforts to sustain the
biosphere are exhausted.

5
00:01:59,102 --> 00:02:00,727
The water tables and tempratures

6
00:02:01,129 --> 00:02:03,923
decrease annually as does our
population.

7
00:02:04,431 --> 00:02:08,517
The only consequential course
of action is the conquest

8
00:02:08,886 --> 00:02:14,066
and occupation of Earth,
our young, sunward neighbour.

9
00:02:16,869 --> 00:02:20,105
Earth is abundant with life
and resources are bountiful.

10
00:02:20,772 --> 00:02:25,395
The environment will seem
uncomfortable but not inhibitive.

11
00:02:26,292 --> 00:02:28,382
The problem is of course the humans.

12
00:02:29,218 --> 00:02:31,669
They have developed primitive
intelligence.

13
00:02:32,520 --> 00:02:35,001
Yet, their society is structured

14
00:02:35,002 --> 00:02:37,482
around perpetual conquest
and conflict.

15
00:02:38,558 --> 00:02:42,299
A rapid offensive to their
social and economic heart,

16
00:02:42,905 --> 00:02:46,337
should prevent any significant
opposition.

17
00:02:47,909 --> 00:02:51,527
The means and methods for this
attack are already being realised.

18
00:02:53,581 --> 00:02:57,932
A large scale hydrogen accelerator
will be constructed.

19
00:02:58,774 --> 00:03:02,879
This will launch suspension pods
carrying the assault forces.

20
00:03:42,603 --> 00:03:47,268
Part one: The Coming of the Martians

21
00:03:51,004 --> 00:03:54,790
No one would have believed, in
the last years of the 19th century,

22
00:03:55,413 --> 00:03:59,207
that human affairs were being watched
from the timeless worlds of space.

23
00:04:00,080 --> 00:04:02,669
No one could have dreamed that
we were being scrutinized

24
00:04:03,182 --> 00:04:05,607
as someone with a microscope studies
creatures that swarm

25
00:04:06,152 --> 00:04:07,963
and multiply in a drop of water.

26
00:04:08,636 --> 00:04:11,739
Few men even considered the
possibility of life on other planets.

27
00:04:12,746 --> 00:04:18,438
And yet, across the gulf of space,
minds immeasurably superior to ours

28
00:04:18,931 --> 00:04:20,876
regarded this earth with
envious eyes,

29
00:04:22,302 --> 00:04:27,162
and slowly and surely, they drew
their plans against us.

30
00:08:42,692 --> 00:08:46,860
At midnight, on the 12th of August,
a huge mass of luminous gas

31
00:08:47,382 --> 00:08:49,166
erupted from Mars and sped towards
Earth.

32
00:08:50,210 --> 00:08:54,756
Across two hundred million miles of
void, invisibly hurtling towards us,

33
00:08:55,216 --> 00:08:56,345
came the first of the missiles

34
00:08:56,696 --> 00:08:58,496
that were to bring so
much calamity to Earth.

35
00:08:59,546 --> 00:09:01,633
As I watched, there was another
jet of gas.

36
00:09:02,448 --> 00:09:05,076
It was another missile, starting
on its way.

37
00:09:36,213 --> 00:09:38,218
And that's how it was for the next
ten nights.

38
00:09:39,074 --> 00:09:41,225
A flare, spurting out from Mars.

39
00:09:41,747 --> 00:09:44,778
Bright green, drawing a green mist
behind it;

40
00:09:45,310 --> 00:09:48,336
a beautiful, but somehow disturbing
sight.

41
00:09:49,494 --> 00:09:52,747
Ogilby, the astronomer, assured me
we were in no danger.

42
00:09:53,224 --> 00:09:55,957
He was convinced there could be
no living thing

43
00:09:56,369 --> 00:09:58,928
on that remote,forbidding planet.

44
00:10:01,091 --> 00:10:03,889
The chances of anything coming
from Mars

45
00:10:04,431 --> 00:10:06,954
Are a million to one, he said

46
00:10:10,355 --> 00:10:13,617
The chances of anything coming
from Mars

47
00:10:14,040 --> 00:10:20,645
Are a million to one, but still,
they come...

48
00:10:22,394 --> 00:10:24,752
Then came the night the first missile
approached Earth.

49
00:10:25,396 --> 00:10:27,417
It was thought to be an ordinary
falling star,

50
00:10:27,952 --> 00:10:30,626
but next day there was a huge crater
in the middle of the common,

51
00:10:31,114 --> 00:10:33,240
and Ogilby came to examine what
lay there.

52
00:10:34,025 --> 00:10:39,063
A cylinder, thirty yards across,
glowing hot, with faint sounds

53
00:10:39,490 --> 00:10:41,355
of movement coming from within.

54
00:10:42,324 --> 00:10:46,168
Suddenly the top began moving:
rotating, unscrewing;

55
00:10:47,210 --> 00:10:50,127
and Ogilby feared there was a man
inside trying to escape.

56
00:10:50,633 --> 00:10:53,026
He rushed to the cylinder but
the intense heat stopped him

57
00:10:53,407 --> 00:10:54,729
before he could burn himself
on the metal.

58
00:10:56,422 --> 00:10:59,346
The chances of anything coming
from Mars

59
00:10:59,836 --> 00:11:02,246
Are a million to one, he said

60
00:11:05,530 --> 00:11:08,961
The chances of anything coming
from Mars

61
00:11:09,331 --> 00:11:15,326
Are a million to one, but still,
they come...

62
00:11:16,917 --> 00:11:20,444
Yes, the chances of anything coming
from Mars

63
00:11:20,964 --> 00:11:23,279
Are a million to one, he said

64
00:11:26,435 --> 00:11:29,712
The chances of anything coming
from Mars

65
00:11:30,155 --> 00:11:35,944
Are a million to one, but still,
they come...

66
00:12:23,435 --> 00:12:27,238
It seems totally incredible to me now
that everyone spent that evening

67
00:12:27,763 --> 00:12:29,113
as though it were just like
any other.

68
00:12:36,852 --> 00:12:39,612
From the railway station came the
sound of shunting trains,

69
00:12:39,987 --> 00:12:44,189
ringing and rumbling, softened almost
into melody by the distance.

70
00:12:51,003 --> 00:12:53,593
It all seemed so safe and tranquil.

71
00:14:07,293 --> 00:14:09,472
Next morning a crowd gathered
on the common,

72
00:14:10,257 --> 00:14:12,907
hypnotized by the unscrewing
of the cylinder.

73
00:14:14,030 --> 00:14:17,818
Two feet of shining screw
projected when suddenly,

74
00:14:18,616 --> 00:14:20,024
the lid fell off.

75
00:14:29,242 --> 00:14:33,155
Two luminous, disk-like eyes
appeared above the rim.

76
00:14:34,333 --> 00:14:39,764
A huge rounded bulk, larger
than a bear, rose up slowly,

77
00:14:40,190 --> 00:14:41,897
glistening like wet leather.

78
00:14:42,615 --> 00:14:47,078
Its lipless mouth quivered and
slathered, and snakelike tentacles

79
00:14:47,493 --> 00:14:50,337
writhed as the clumsy body
heaved and pulsated.

80
00:16:13,285 --> 00:16:15,209
A few young men crept closer
to the pit.

81
00:16:16,211 --> 00:16:20,654
A tall funnel rose and an invisible
ray of heat leapt from man to man,

82
00:16:21,271 --> 00:16:24,664
and there was a bright glare as
each was instantly turned to fire.

83
00:16:25,351 --> 00:16:28,231
Every tree and bush became a mass
of flames at the touch of this

84
00:16:28,684 --> 00:16:31,153
savage, unearthly heat ray.

85
00:18:25,071 --> 00:18:28,416
People clawed their way off the
common, and I ran too.

86
00:18:28,957 --> 00:18:32,123
I felt I was being toyed with,
that when I was on the very verge

87
00:18:32,618 --> 00:18:35,341
of safety this mysterious death would
leap after me and strike me down.

88
00:18:36,433 --> 00:18:40,271
At last I reached Maybury Hill, and
in the dim coolness of my home

89
00:18:40,941 --> 00:18:42,907
I wrote an account for my
newspaper

90
00:18:43,424 --> 00:18:46,635
before I sank into a
, haunted sleep.

91
00:19:44,719 --> 00:19:47,047
I awoke to alien sounds of
hammering from the pit

92
00:19:47,564 --> 00:19:50,155
and hurried to the railway station
to buy the paper.

93
00:19:59,538 --> 00:20:03,869
Around me, the daily routine of life,
working, eating, sleeping,

94
00:20:04,365 --> 00:20:07,954
was continuing serenely as it had
for countless years.

95
00:20:17,537 --> 00:20:20,074
On Horsell Common,
the Martians continued

96
00:20:20,479 --> 00:20:22,347
hammering and stirring, sleepless,

97
00:20:22,712 --> 00:20:25,764
indefatigable, at work on the
machines they were making.

98
00:20:26,374 --> 00:20:29,421
Now and again a light like the beam
of a warship's searchlight

99
00:20:29,841 --> 00:20:33,658
would sweep the common, and the heat
ray was ready to follow.

100
00:22:50,472 --> 00:22:53,348
In the afternoon, a company of
soldiers came through

101
00:22:53,998 --> 00:22:57,123
and deployed along the common
to form a cordon.

102
00:23:10,112 --> 00:23:14,629
That evening, there was a violent
crash and I realized with horror

103
00:23:15,058 --> 00:23:17,346
that my home was within range
of the Martian's heat ray.

104
00:23:30,219 --> 00:23:33,397
At dawn, a falling star with
a trail of green mist

105
00:23:33,865 --> 00:23:36,532
landed with a flash like summer
lightning.

106
00:23:37,099 --> 00:23:38,717
This was the second cylinder.

107
00:25:23,012 --> 00:25:26,614
The hammering from the pit and
the pounding of guns grew louder.

108
00:25:27,618 --> 00:25:30,802
My fear rose at the sound of
someone creeping into the house.

109
00:25:31,856 --> 00:25:33,711
Then I saw it was a young
artilleryman,

110
00:25:34,403 --> 00:25:36,857
weary, streaked with blood
and dirt.

111
00:25:37,449 --> 00:25:41,438
Anyone here?
-Come in. Here, drink this.

112
00:25:41,938 --> 00:25:43,934
Thank you.
-What's happened?

113
00:25:45,099 --> 00:25:48,262
They wiped us out. Hundreds dead,
maybe thousands.

114
00:25:48,983 --> 00:25:50,344
The heat ray?
-The Martians.

115
00:25:50,816 --> 00:25:52,958
They were inside the hoods of
machines they'd made,

116
00:25:53,424 --> 00:25:57,081
massive metal things on legs.
Giant machines that walked.

117
00:25:57,816 --> 00:26:00,844
They attacked us.
They wiped us out.

118
00:26:01,380 --> 00:26:02,800
Machines?
-Fighting machines,

119
00:26:02,871 --> 00:26:05,326
picking up men and bashing
them against trees.

120
00:26:05,770 --> 00:26:08,969
Just hunks of metal, but they knew
exactly what they were doing.

121
00:26:10,058 --> 00:26:12,183
Hmm. There was another cylinder
came last night.

122
00:26:12,629 --> 00:26:14,815
Yes. Yes, it looked bound for London.

123
00:26:15,253 --> 00:26:18,174
London! Carrie! I hadn't dreamed
there could be danger

124
00:26:18,517 --> 00:26:20,765
to Carrie and her father,
so many miles away.

125
00:26:22,217 --> 00:26:23,506
I must go to London at once.

126
00:26:23,823 --> 00:26:25,864
And me, got to report to
headquarters,

127
00:26:26,649 --> 00:26:28,119
if there's anything left of it.

128
00:27:18,590 --> 00:27:21,411
At Byfleet, we came upon an inn,
but it was deserted.

129
00:27:21,750 --> 00:27:25,505
Is everybody dead?
-Not everybody, look...

130
00:27:26,283 --> 00:27:28,576
Six cannons with gunners
standing by.

131
00:27:28,987 --> 00:27:30,648
Bows and arrows against the
lightning.

132
00:27:31,180 --> 00:27:33,884
They haven't seen the heat ray yet.

133
00:28:05,609 --> 00:28:07,152
We hurried along the road to
Weybridge.

134
00:28:08,070 --> 00:28:10,016
Suddenly, there was a heavy
explosion.

135
00:28:10,973 --> 00:28:13,649
The Ground heaved,
windows shatterd

136
00:28:14,190 --> 00:28:16,136
and gusts of smoke erupted
into the air.

137
00:28:16,900 --> 00:28:20,580
Look! There they are!
What did I tell you!

138
00:28:43,148 --> 00:28:46,912
Quickly, one after the other, four
of the fighting machines appeared.

139
00:28:47,529 --> 00:28:50,185
Monstrous tripods, higher than
the tallest steeple,

140
00:28:50,660 --> 00:28:52,764
striding over the pine trees
and smashing them,

141
00:28:53,226 --> 00:28:55,225
walking engines of glittering metal.

142
00:28:55,700 --> 00:28:58,553
Each carried a huge funnel
and I realized with horror

143
00:28:58,938 --> 00:29:00,678
that I'd seen this awful thing
before.

144
00:29:39,525 --> 00:29:41,524
A fifth machine
appeared on the far bank.

145
00:29:42,076 --> 00:29:43,745
It raised itself to full height,

146
00:29:44,164 --> 00:29:45,892
flourished the funnel high
in the air,

147
00:29:46,304 --> 00:29:50,156
and the ghostly terrible
heat ray struck the town.

148
00:29:57,814 --> 00:30:00,674
As it struck, all five fighting
machines exulted,

149
00:30:01,091 --> 00:30:04,602
emitting deafening howls which
roared like thunder.

150
00:32:45,914 --> 00:32:49,635
The six guns we had seen
now fired simultaneously,

151
00:32:50,309 --> 00:32:51,927
decapitating a fighting machine.

152
00:32:52,789 --> 00:32:55,974
The Martian inside the hood was
slain, splashed to the four winds,

153
00:32:56,542 --> 00:32:59,521
and the body, nothing now but an
intricate device of metal,

154
00:33:00,029 --> 00:33:01,631
went whirling to destruction.

155
00:33:02,290 --> 00:33:05,562
As the other monsters advanced,
people ran away blindly,

156
00:33:05,968 --> 00:33:09,176
the artilleryman among them,
but I jumped into the water

157
00:33:09,585 --> 00:33:11,781
and hid until forced up to breathe.

158
00:33:12,282 --> 00:33:16,259
Now the guns spoke again,
but this time the heat ray

159
00:33:16,698 --> 00:33:18,877
sent them to oblivion.

160
00:33:59,467 --> 00:34:02,165
With a white flash the heat ray
swept across the river.

161
00:34:02,717 --> 00:34:06,185
Scalded, half blinded and agonized,
I staggered through leaping,

162
00:34:06,588 --> 00:34:08,109
hissing water towards the shore.

163
00:34:08,624 --> 00:34:12,731
I fell in full sight of the Martians,
expecting nothing but death.

164
00:34:13,163 --> 00:34:15,527
The foot of a fighting machine
came down close to my head,

165
00:34:15,884 --> 00:34:18,971
then lifted again as the four
Martians carried away the debris

166
00:34:19,318 --> 00:34:23,739
of their fallen comrade, and I
realized that by a miracle,

167
00:34:24,168 --> 00:34:25,336
I had escaped.

168
00:35:33,187 --> 00:35:36,645
For three days I fought my way
along roads packed with refugees,

169
00:35:37,139 --> 00:35:39,102
the homeless, burdened with boxes

170
00:35:39,475 --> 00:35:41,308
and bundles containing their
valuables.

171
00:35:41,767 --> 00:35:43,785
All that was of value to me was
in London.

172
00:35:44,945 --> 00:35:47,512
By the time I reached their
little red brick house,

173
00:35:48,149 --> 00:35:50,655
Carrie and her father were gone.

174
00:36:00,151 --> 00:36:05,929
The summer sun is fading as the
year grows old,

175
00:36:08,144 --> 00:36:13,274
And darker days are drawing near,

176
00:36:16,817 --> 00:36:22,320
The winter winds will be much colder,

177
00:36:23,085 --> 00:36:27,098
Now you're not here.

178
00:36:33,659 --> 00:36:39,236
I watch the birds fly south
across the autumn sky

179
00:36:41,623 --> 00:36:47,779
And one by one they disappear,

180
00:36:49,617 --> 00:36:54,493
I wish that I was flying with them

181
00:36:55,524 --> 00:36:58,826
Now you're not here.

182
00:37:00,774 --> 00:37:06,747
Like the sun through the trees
you came to love me,

183
00:37:08,972 --> 00:37:17,021
Like a leaf on a breeze
you blew away...

184
00:37:29,169 --> 00:37:34,555
Through autumn's golden gown
we used to kick our way,

185
00:37:36,873 --> 00:37:42,064
You always loved this time of year

186
00:37:44,587 --> 00:37:49,684
Those fallen leaves lie undisturbed
now

187
00:37:50,422 --> 00:37:53,234
Cause you're not here

188
00:37:54,173 --> 00:37:57,438
Cause you're not here

189
00:37:58,012 --> 00:38:01,598
Cause you're not here

190
00:38:18,134 --> 00:38:20,822
Fire suddenly leapt from house
to house.

191
00:38:21,346 --> 00:38:25,479
The population panicked and ran,
and I was swept along with them,

192
00:38:25,920 --> 00:38:27,738
aimless and lost without Carrie.

193
00:38:28,566 --> 00:38:31,768
Finally, I headed eastward
for the ocean

194
00:38:32,131 --> 00:38:36,036
and my only hope of survival:
a boat out of England.

195
00:38:36,576 --> 00:38:42,024
Like the sun through the trees
you came to love me,

196
00:38:43,890 --> 00:38:50,267
Like a leaf on the breeze you
blew away...

197
00:39:03,852 --> 00:39:09,572
A gentle rain falls softly on
my weary eyes

198
00:39:11,795 --> 00:39:17,129
As if to hide a lonely tear

199
00:39:19,578 --> 00:39:24,582
My life will be forever autumn,

200
00:39:25,801 --> 00:39:28,393
Cause you're not here

201
00:39:29,393 --> 00:39:32,387
Cause you're not here

202
00:39:33,049 --> 00:39:37,531
Cause you're not here

203
00:39:44,602 --> 00:39:47,768
As I hastened through Covent Garden,
Blackfriars and Billingsgate,

204
00:39:48,181 --> 00:39:51,069
more and more people joined
the painful exodus.

205
00:39:51,510 --> 00:39:56,009
Sad, weary women, their children
stumbling in the street with tears,

206
00:39:56,481 --> 00:39:59,321
their men bitter and angry,
the rich rubbing shoulders

207
00:39:59,709 --> 00:40:01,351
with beggars and outcasts.

208
00:40:02,382 --> 00:40:05,706
Dogs snarled and whined, the horse's
bits were covered with foam,

209
00:40:06,283 --> 00:40:10,156
and here and there were wounded
soldiers, as helpless as the rest.

210
00:40:25,169 --> 00:40:28,811
We saw tripods wading up the Thames,
cutting through bridges

211
00:40:29,186 --> 00:40:30,322
as though they were paper.

212
00:40:30,931 --> 00:40:36,308
Waterloo bridge, Westminster bridge,
one appeared above Big Ben.

213
00:40:57,419 --> 00:40:59,271
Never before in the history
of the world,

214
00:40:59,660 --> 00:41:02,683
had such a mass of human beings
moved and suffered together.

215
00:41:03,355 --> 00:41:06,294
This was no disciplined march,
it was a stampede,

216
00:41:06,716 --> 00:41:10,451
without order and without a goal,
six million people unarmed

217
00:41:10,938 --> 00:41:13,321
and unprovisioned driving headlong.

218
00:41:14,425 --> 00:41:17,611
It was the beginning of the
rout of civilization,

219
00:41:18,269 --> 00:41:20,701
of the massacre of mankind.

220
00:41:43,672 --> 00:41:47,064
A vast crowd buffeted me towards
the already packed steamer.

221
00:41:47,930 --> 00:41:50,436
I looked up enviously at those
safely on board...

222
00:41:51,182 --> 00:41:54,183
straight into the eyes of my
beloved Carrie.

223
00:41:55,059 --> 00:41:57,596
At sight of me she began to fight
her way along the packed deck

224
00:41:57,650 --> 00:41:58,937
to the gangplank.

225
00:41:59,350 --> 00:42:03,154
At that very moment, it was raised,
and I caught a last glimpse

226
00:42:03,584 --> 00:42:08,451
of her despairing face as the crowd
swept me away from her.

227
00:42:08,999 --> 00:42:13,976
Like the sun through the trees
you came to love me,

228
00:42:16,220 --> 00:42:22,160
Like a leaf on a breeze
you blew away...

229
00:42:35,766 --> 00:42:41,118
Through autumn's golden gown
we used to kick our way

230
00:42:43,359 --> 00:42:48,452
You always loved this time of year

231
00:42:51,090 --> 00:42:56,313
Those fallen leaves lie undisturbed
now

232
00:42:57,156 --> 00:43:00,047
Cause you're not here

233
00:43:00,885 --> 00:43:03,997
Cause you're not here

234
00:43:04,580 --> 00:43:07,844
Cause you're not here

235
00:43:32,886 --> 00:43:36,934
The steamer began to move slowly
away, but on the landward horizon

236
00:43:37,345 --> 00:43:39,235
appeared the silhouette of a
fighting machine.

237
00:43:39,966 --> 00:43:43,528
Another came, and another, striding
over hills and trees,

238
00:43:44,034 --> 00:43:47,000
plunging far out to sea and blocking
the exit of the steamer.

239
00:43:47,738 --> 00:43:52,176
Between them lay the silent, gray,
ironclad Thunderchild.

240
00:43:53,038 --> 00:43:56,499
Slowly it moved towards shore,
then with a deafening roar

241
00:43:56,925 --> 00:44:00,897
and whoosh of spray it swung about
and drove at full speed towards

242
00:44:01,256 --> 00:44:02,190
the waiting Martians.

243
00:44:04,626 --> 00:44:07,458
There were ships of shapes and sizes,

244
00:44:07,878 --> 00:44:10,094
Scattered out along the bay

245
00:44:10,561 --> 00:44:13,404
And I thought I heard her calling,

246
00:44:13,828 --> 00:44:16,331
As the steamer pulled away

247
00:44:16,791 --> 00:44:19,690
The invaders must have seen them

248
00:44:20,027 --> 00:44:22,785
As across the coast they filed

249
00:44:23,506 --> 00:44:26,280
Standing firm between them,

250
00:44:27,822 --> 00:44:32,392
There lay Thunderchild

251
00:44:35,755 --> 00:44:38,415
Moving swiftly through the waters,

252
00:44:38,770 --> 00:44:41,448
Cannons blazing as she came,

253
00:44:41,877 --> 00:44:44,682
Brought a mighty metal warlord

254
00:44:45,065 --> 00:44:47,606
Crashing down in sheets of flame,

255
00:44:47,960 --> 00:44:50,772
Sensing victory was nearing,

256
00:44:51,179 --> 00:44:54,117
Thinking fortune must have smiled,

257
00:44:54,576 --> 00:44:57,533
People started cheering,

258
00:44:58,674 --> 00:45:06,949
"Come on Thunderchild!
Come on Thunderchild!"

259
00:45:11,514 --> 00:45:14,885
The Martians released their black
smoke, but the ship sped on,

260
00:45:15,569 --> 00:45:17,362
cutting down one of the
tripod figures.

261
00:45:17,815 --> 00:45:20,029
Instantly, the others raised
their heat rays,

262
00:45:20,443 --> 00:45:23,490
and melted the Thunderchild's
valiant heart.

263
00:46:27,201 --> 00:46:30,124
Lashing ropes and smashing timbers,

264
00:46:30,649 --> 00:46:33,229
Flashing heat rays pierced the deck,

265
00:46:33,622 --> 00:46:36,220
Dashing hopes for our deliverance,

266
00:46:36,616 --> 00:46:39,210
As we watched the sinking wreck,

267
00:46:39,642 --> 00:46:42,305
With the smoke of battle clearing,

268
00:46:42,698 --> 00:46:45,565
Over graves and waves defiled,

269
00:46:46,131 --> 00:46:54,296
Slowly disappearing,
farewell Thunderchild!

270
00:46:54,983 --> 00:47:04,849
Slowly disappearing,
farewell Thunderchild!

271
00:47:08,575 --> 00:47:12,265
Farewell Thunderchild!

272
00:47:14,860 --> 00:47:23,679
Farewell Thunderchild,
child, child, child, child...

273
00:47:24,656 --> 00:47:26,815
When the smoke cleared,
the little steamer had reached

274
00:47:27,156 --> 00:47:29,433
the misty horizon,
and Carrie was safe.

275
00:47:30,456 --> 00:47:33,421
But the Thunderchild had vanished
forever, taking with her

276
00:47:33,789 --> 00:47:35,130
man's last hope of victory.

277
00:47:36,137 --> 00:47:40,239
The leaden sky was lit by green
flashes, cylinder following cylinder,

278
00:47:40,675 --> 00:47:43,121
and no one and nothing was
left now to fight them.

279
00:47:43,619 --> 00:47:46,243
The earth belonged to the
Martians.

280
00:49:01,575 --> 00:49:08,006
Part Two:
The Earth Under the Martians

281
00:49:26,537 --> 00:49:31,694
Next day, the dawn was a brilliant,
fiery red and I wandered

282
00:49:32,142 --> 00:49:35,946
through the weird and lurid landscape
of another planet,

283
00:49:36,546 --> 00:49:38,008
for the vegetation that
gives Mars

284
00:49:38,390 --> 00:49:41,280
its red appearance had
taken root on earth.

285
00:49:42,264 --> 00:49:44,394
As man had succumbed to the Martians,

286
00:49:44,807 --> 00:49:47,458
so our land now succumbed
to the red weed.

287
00:53:53,705 --> 00:53:55,821
Wherever there was a stream
the red weed clung

288
00:53:56,429 --> 00:53:58,461
and grew with frightening
voraciousness,

289
00:53:58,885 --> 00:54:02,055
its claw-like fronds choking
the movement of the water.

290
00:54:02,767 --> 00:54:05,783
And then it began to creep
like a slimy red animal

291
00:54:06,185 --> 00:54:11,504
across the land covering field
and ditch and tree and hedgerow

292
00:54:11,961 --> 00:54:16,792
with living scarlet feelers,
crawling, crawling.

293
00:54:58,671 --> 00:55:00,932
I suddenly noticed the body
of a parson lying on the ground

294
00:55:01,391 --> 00:55:02,556
in a ruined churchyard.

295
00:55:03,537 --> 00:55:06,001
I felt unable to leave him to
the mercy of the red weed,

296
00:55:07,023 --> 00:55:08,778
and decided to bury him, decently.

297
00:55:09,640 --> 00:55:12,732
Nathaniel! Nathaniel!

298
00:55:21,307 --> 00:55:24,557
The parson's eyes flickered open.
He was alive!

299
00:55:44,733 --> 00:55:48,132
Nathaniel, I saw the church burst
into flame, are you all right?

300
00:55:48,266 --> 00:55:49,429
Don't touch me!

301
00:55:49,655 --> 00:55:51,279
But it's me, Beth! Your wife!

302
00:55:51,768 --> 00:55:54,306
No! You're one of them- a devil!

303
00:55:54,892 --> 00:55:58,141
He's delirious!
-Lies! I saw the devil's sign!

304
00:55:58,505 --> 00:56:00,905
What are you saying?
-The green flash in the sky.

305
00:56:01,529 --> 00:56:04,542
His demons were here all along,
in our hearts and souls,

306
00:56:05,281 --> 00:56:09,915
just waiting for a sign from Him.
And now they're destroying our world!

307
00:56:10,331 --> 00:56:12,634
But they're not devils,
they're Martians.

308
00:56:13,377 --> 00:56:17,468
We must leave here.
-Look, a house still standing,

309
00:56:17,878 --> 00:56:19,145
come Nathaniel, quickly.

310
00:56:19,548 --> 00:56:22,568
We took shelter in a cottage, and
black smoke spread, hemming us in.

311
00:56:23,453 --> 00:56:26,336
Then a fighting machine came across
the field spraying jets of steam

312
00:56:26,769 --> 00:56:28,661
that turned the smoke into thick,
black dust.

313
00:56:36,743 --> 00:56:38,842
Dear God, help us!

314
00:56:39,251 --> 00:56:42,376
The voice of the Devil is heard
in our land!

315
00:56:45,486 --> 00:56:47,365
Listen, do you hear them drawing near

316
00:56:47,769 --> 00:56:49,696
In their search for the sinners?

317
00:56:52,264 --> 00:56:54,512
Feeding on the power of our fear

318
00:56:55,043 --> 00:56:57,663
And the evil within us?

319
00:56:59,055 --> 00:57:03,714
In carnation of Satan's creation
of all that we dread

320
00:57:06,261 --> 00:57:12,806
When the demons arrive those alive
will be better off dead

321
00:57:13,347 --> 00:57:16,515
There must be something worth
living for

322
00:57:18,365 --> 00:57:22,944
There must be something worth
trying for

323
00:57:24,250 --> 00:57:27,849
Even something worth dying for

324
00:57:29,489 --> 00:57:32,266
And if one man can stand tall

325
00:57:32,856 --> 00:57:35,303
There must be hope for us all

326
00:57:36,515 --> 00:57:41,091
Somewhere, somewhere in
the spirit of man

327
00:57:47,005 --> 00:57:52,168
Once, there was a time when I
believed without hesitation

328
00:57:53,617 --> 00:57:56,409
That the power of love and truth
could conquer all

329
00:57:56,883 --> 00:58:00,302
In the name of salvation

330
00:58:00,958 --> 00:58:05,656
Tell me what kind of weapon is love
when it comes to the fight?

331
00:58:07,917 --> 00:58:13,943
And just how much protection is truth
against all Satan's might?

332
00:58:14,962 --> 00:58:18,437
There must be something worth
living for

333
00:58:19,923 --> 00:58:24,392
There must be something worth
trying for

334
00:58:25,327 --> 00:58:29,363
Even some things worth dying for

335
00:58:30,906 --> 00:58:33,711
And if one man could stand tall

336
00:58:34,245 --> 00:58:37,391
There must be some hope for us all

337
00:58:38,122 --> 00:58:42,878
Somewhere, somewhere in
the spirit of man

338
00:58:57,209 --> 00:59:03,118
People loved you, and trusted you,
came to you for help...

339
00:59:03,807 --> 00:59:09,100
Didn't I warn them this would happen?
Be on your guard, I said,

340
00:59:09,783 --> 00:59:11,847
for the Evil One never rests...

341
00:59:13,992 --> 00:59:20,598
I said exorcise the devil!
But no, they wouldn't listen,

342
00:59:21,457 --> 00:59:24,415
the demons inside them grew
and grew,

343
00:59:25,172 --> 00:59:30,881
until Satan gave his signal
and destroyed the world we knew!

344
00:59:31,333 --> 00:59:35,061
No Nathaniel, oh no Nathaniel,

345
00:59:37,960 --> 00:59:44,099
No Nathaniel, no, there must be
more to life,

346
00:59:45,307 --> 00:59:48,769
There has to be a way that we can

347
00:59:49,240 --> 00:59:53,543
Restore to life the love we used
to know

348
00:59:54,036 --> 00:59:59,232
Nathaniel, no, there must be
more to life,

349
01:00:00,363 --> 01:00:04,195
There has to be a way that we can

350
01:00:04,635 --> 01:00:10,403
Restore to life the light that
we have lost

351
01:00:51,131 --> 01:00:53,257
Now darkness has descended
on our land

352
01:00:53,691 --> 01:00:55,993
And all your prayers cannot save us

353
01:00:58,063 --> 01:01:00,067
Like fools we've let the devil
take command

354
01:01:00,658 --> 01:01:04,207
Of the souls that God gave us

355
01:01:04,711 --> 01:01:09,651
To the altar of evil like lambs
to the slaughter were led

356
01:01:12,088 --> 01:01:18,285
When the demons arrive the survivors
will envy the dead!

357
01:01:19,305 --> 01:01:21,920
There must be something worth
living for

358
01:01:22,424 --> 01:01:23,489
No, there is nothing!

359
01:01:24,027 --> 01:01:29,188
There must be something worth
trying for -I don't believe it's so!

360
01:01:29,698 --> 01:01:33,430
Even something worth dying for

361
01:01:34,747 --> 01:01:37,592
If just one man could stand tall

362
01:01:38,369 --> 01:01:40,952
There would be some hope for us all,

363
01:01:42,000 --> 01:01:46,760
Somewhere, somewhere in
the spirit of man

364
01:01:48,502 --> 01:01:52,131
Forget about goodness and mercy,
they're gone!

365
01:02:37,486 --> 01:02:41,839
Didn't I warn them?
Pray, I said!

366
01:02:43,284 --> 01:02:50,163
Destroy the devil, I said!
They wouldn't listen!

367
01:02:52,366 --> 01:02:57,856
I could have saved the world!
But now it's too late...

368
01:02:59,222 --> 01:03:00,596
too late!

369
01:03:00,964 --> 01:03:06,329
No Nathaniel, oh no Nathaniel,

370
01:03:08,825 --> 01:03:15,187
No Nathaniel, no, there must be
more to life,

371
01:03:16,245 --> 01:03:19,996
There has to be a way that we can

372
01:03:20,537 --> 01:03:24,372
Restore to life the love we used
to know

373
01:03:24,875 --> 01:03:30,910
Nathaniel, no, there must be
more to life,

374
01:03:31,375 --> 01:03:35,355
There has to be a way that we can

375
01:03:35,812 --> 01:03:42,877
Restore to life the light that
we have lost...

376
01:04:13,813 --> 01:04:16,345
Dear God! A cylinder's landed
on the house,

377
01:04:16,893 --> 01:04:18,827
and we are underneath it,
in the pit!

378
01:04:28,674 --> 01:04:31,050
The Martians spent the night making
a new machine.

379
01:04:31,853 --> 01:04:35,985
It was a squat, metallic spider
with huge, articulated claws,

380
01:04:36,742 --> 01:04:39,180
but it, too, had a hood in which
a Martian sat.

381
01:04:39,994 --> 01:04:42,282
I watched it pursuing some people
across a field.

382
01:04:42,824 --> 01:04:44,562
It caught them nimbly and
tossed them

383
01:04:44,931 --> 01:04:46,666
into a great metal basket
upon its back.

384
01:04:51,244 --> 01:04:52,891
Beth? She’s dead!

385
01:04:57,967 --> 01:05:01,512
Buried under the rubble.
Why?

386
01:05:03,609 --> 01:05:06,498
Satan! Why did you take one of
your own?

387
01:05:17,107 --> 01:05:23,110
There is a curse on mankind
We may as well be resigned

388
01:05:24,200 --> 01:05:32,343
To let the devil, the devil take
the spirit of man

389
01:05:52,516 --> 01:05:54,846
As time passed in our dark and
dusty prison,

390
01:05:55,597 --> 01:05:57,944
the parson wrestled endlessly
with his doubts.

391
01:05:58,856 --> 01:06:04,159
His outcries invited death for
us both, and yet I pitied him.

392
01:07:26,813 --> 01:07:29,744
Then, on the ninth day, we saw
the Martians eating.

393
01:07:30,494 --> 01:07:33,424
Inside the hood of their new machine
they were drawing the fresh,

394
01:07:33,886 --> 01:07:38,167
living blood of men and women and
injecting it into their own veins.

395
01:07:38,657 --> 01:07:42,900
Aaah! It's a sign!
I've been given a sign!

396
01:07:43,921 --> 01:07:48,429
They must be cast out, and I
have been chosen to do it!

397
01:07:49,260 --> 01:07:51,774
I must confront them now!
-No, parson, no!

398
01:07:52,157 --> 01:07:54,423
Those machines are just demons
in another form.

399
01:07:56,007 --> 01:07:57,907
I shall destroy them with my
prayers,

400
01:07:58,883 --> 01:08:02,662
I shall burn them with my holy
cross. I shall...

401
01:08:06,291 --> 01:08:09,071
The curious eye of a Martian
appeared at the window slit,

402
01:08:09,443 --> 01:08:11,351
and a menacing claw explored
the room.

403
01:08:11,831 --> 01:08:13,677
I dragged the parson down
to the coal cellar.

404
01:08:14,121 --> 01:08:16,008
I heard the Martian fumbling
at the latch.

405
01:08:16,526 --> 01:08:18,789
In the darkness I could see
the claw touching things,

406
01:08:19,323 --> 01:08:21,520
walls, coal, wood.

407
01:08:22,048 --> 01:08:24,897
And then, it touched my boot.
I almost shouted.

408
01:08:25,676 --> 01:08:28,081
For a time it was still,
and then, with a click,

409
01:08:28,495 --> 01:08:30,527
it gripped something: the parson!

410
01:08:31,044 --> 01:08:35,220
With slow, deliberate movements, his
unconscious body was dragged away,

411
01:08:35,754 --> 01:08:38,104
and there was nothing I could do
to prevent it.

412
01:10:43,193 --> 01:10:47,315
I crept to the blocked window slit
and peered through the creeper.

413
01:10:47,924 --> 01:10:50,296
The Martians, and all their
machinery, had gone!

414
01:10:50,876 --> 01:10:54,302
Trembling, I dug my way out and
clambered to the top of the mound:

415
01:10:54,727 --> 01:10:55,970
not a Martian in sight!

416
01:10:56,434 --> 01:10:59,208
The day seemed dazzling bright
after my imprisonment

417
01:10:59,633 --> 01:11:01,364
and the sky a glowing blue.

418
01:11:01,885 --> 01:11:05,354
Red weed covered every scrap
of ground but a gentle breeze

419
01:11:05,770 --> 01:11:11,099
kept it swaying, and oh,
the sweetness of the air.

420
01:12:55,278 --> 01:12:58,900
Again, I was on my way to London
through towns and villages

421
01:12:59,303 --> 01:13:01,310
that were blackened ruins,
totally silent,

422
01:13:01,722 --> 01:13:03,310
desolated, deserted.

423
01:13:03,881 --> 01:13:07,820
Man's empire had passed away,
taken swiftly and without error

424
01:13:08,621 --> 01:13:12,365
by these creatures who were
composed entirely of brain.

425
01:13:12,987 --> 01:13:15,695
Unhampered by the complex systems
which make up man,

426
01:13:16,093 --> 01:13:19,258
they made and used different bodies
according to their needs.

427
01:13:19,780 --> 01:13:22,885
They never tired, never slept,
and never suffered,

428
01:13:23,258 --> 01:13:26,565
having long since eliminated
from their planet the bacteria

429
01:13:26,954 --> 01:13:29,949
which cause all fevers and
other morbidities.

430
01:13:36,001 --> 01:13:38,138
Halt! Who goes there?
-Er, a friend...

431
01:13:38,613 --> 01:13:41,335
Be on your way, this is
my territory!

432
01:13:42,124 --> 01:13:43,731
Your territory? What do you mean?

433
01:13:44,196 --> 01:13:47,166
Wait a minute... it's you!
The man from Maybury Hill!

434
01:13:48,458 --> 01:13:52,138
Good heavens, the artilleryman.
I thought you'd surely burned.

435
01:13:52,573 --> 01:13:55,441
I thought you'd surely drowned.
-Have you seen any Martians?

436
01:13:55,902 --> 01:13:59,039
Everywhere. We're done for all
right. -We can't just give up.

437
01:13:59,444 --> 01:14:02,753
`Course we can't. It's now that
we've got to start fighting.

438
01:14:03,313 --> 01:14:05,104
Not against them,
cause we can't win.

439
01:14:05,567 --> 01:14:07,732
Now, we've got to fight for
survival.

440
01:14:08,436 --> 01:14:12,370
I reckon we can make it.
I've got a plan.

441
01:14:31,335 --> 01:14:35,413
We're gonna build a whole
new world for ourselves.

442
01:14:35,825 --> 01:14:38,180
Look, they clap eyes on us
and we're dead, right?

443
01:14:39,532 --> 01:14:43,543
So, we gotta make a new life
where they'll never find us.

444
01:14:44,136 --> 01:14:47,889
You know where? Underground.

445
01:14:48,415 --> 01:14:51,981
You should see it down there,
hundreds of miles of drains,

446
01:14:52,443 --> 01:15:01,002
sweet and clean now after
the rain, dark, quiet, safe.

447
01:15:01,421 --> 01:15:04,515
We can build houses and everything,
start again from scratch.

448
01:15:05,967 --> 01:15:08,662
And what's so bad about living
underground, eh?

449
01:15:09,183 --> 01:15:12,079
S'not been so great living up
here, if you want my opinion.

450
01:15:22,145 --> 01:15:33,208
Take a look around you at
the world we've come to know

451
01:15:34,536 --> 01:15:44,401
Does it seem to be much more
than a crazy circus show

452
01:15:47,298 --> 01:15:56,570
Maybe from the madness,
something beautiful will grow

453
01:15:58,985 --> 01:16:07,230
In a brave new world,
with just a handful of men,

454
01:16:10,286 --> 01:16:15,195
We'll start... we'll start
all over again!

455
01:16:16,483 --> 01:16:25,843
All over again! All over again!
All over again!

456
01:16:36,621 --> 01:16:39,661
We'll build shops and hospitals
and barracks,

457
01:16:40,066 --> 01:16:43,438
right under their noses,
right under their feet.

458
01:16:44,268 --> 01:16:48,449
Everything we need:
banks, prisons and schools.

459
01:16:49,020 --> 01:16:51,806
We'll send scouting parties
to collect books and stuff,

460
01:16:52,365 --> 01:16:55,136
and men like you we'll teach
the kids.

461
01:16:55,289 --> 01:17:00,567
Not poems and rubbish; science,
so we can get everything working!

462
01:17:01,177 --> 01:17:03,745
We'll build villages and towns,
and...

463
01:17:04,056 --> 01:17:05,426
and we'll play each other
at cricket!

464
01:17:05,901 --> 01:17:09,603
Listen, maybe one day we'll capture
a fighting machine,

465
01:17:10,371 --> 01:17:14,876
learn how to make `em ourselves,
and then: WALLOP!

466
01:17:16,525 --> 01:17:18,261
Our turn to do some wiping out!

467
01:17:18,835 --> 01:17:22,733
WHOOSH! With our heat ray!
Whoosh!

468
01:17:23,259 --> 01:17:28,139
And them running and dying,
beaten at their own game,

469
01:17:29,312 --> 01:17:31,351
man on top again!

470
01:18:07,554 --> 01:18:10,473
Now our domination of the earth
is fading fast,

471
01:18:10,929 --> 01:18:14,131
And out of the confusion
a chance has come at last,

472
01:18:14,577 --> 01:18:17,821
To build a better future
from the ashes of the past,

473
01:18:18,274 --> 01:18:23,800
In a brave new world,
with just a handful of men,

474
01:18:25,138 --> 01:18:28,298
We'll start all over again!

475
01:18:37,958 --> 01:18:41,498
Look, man is born in freedom,
but he soon becomes a slave,

476
01:18:41,953 --> 01:18:45,286
In cages of convention from
the cradle to the grave,

477
01:18:45,730 --> 01:18:48,920
The weak fall by the wayside
but the strong will be saved,

478
01:18:49,396 --> 01:18:55,076
In a brave new world,
with just a handful of men,

479
01:18:56,242 --> 01:18:58,969
We'll start all over again!

480
01:19:09,773 --> 01:19:12,534
I'm not trying to tell you
what to be,

481
01:19:13,375 --> 01:19:16,834
Oh no, oh no, not me...

482
01:19:18,777 --> 01:19:22,635
But if mankind is to survive,
the people life alive,

483
01:19:23,558 --> 01:19:28,035
They're gonna have to build
this world anew

484
01:19:30,076 --> 01:19:37,876
And it's going to have to start
with me and you... YES!

485
01:20:25,384 --> 01:20:28,272
I'm not trying to tell you what
to be,

486
01:20:28,855 --> 01:20:32,291
Oh no, oh no, not me...

487
01:20:34,047 --> 01:20:38,205
But if mankind is to survive,
the people left alive,

488
01:20:38,865 --> 01:20:43,196
They're gonna have to build
this world anew

489
01:20:44,827 --> 01:20:51,281
Yes and we will have to be
the chosen few...

490
01:20:52,372 --> 01:20:55,687
Just think of all the poverty,
the hatred and the lies,

491
01:20:56,168 --> 01:20:59,389
And imagine the destruction
of all that you despise,

492
01:20:59,856 --> 01:21:03,065
Slowly from the ashes
the phoenix will arise,

493
01:21:03,491 --> 01:21:09,514
In a brave new world,
with just a handful of men

494
01:21:10,257 --> 01:21:12,712
We'll start all over again!

495
01:22:06,906 --> 01:22:15,873
Take a look around you at the
world you've loved so well,

496
01:22:17,665 --> 01:22:24,504
And bid the aging empire
of man a last farewell

497
01:22:26,484 --> 01:22:34,719
It may not sound like heaven
but at least it isn't hell

498
01:22:36,846 --> 01:22:44,630
It's a brave new world
with just a handful of men,

499
01:22:47,005 --> 01:22:51,536
We'll start, we'll start
all over again!

500
01:22:52,727 --> 01:22:59,219
All over again! All over again!
All over again!

501
01:23:03,581 --> 01:23:06,233
I'VE GOT A PLAN!

502
01:23:08,942 --> 01:23:10,029
Can't you just see it?

503
01:23:10,415 --> 01:23:14,674
Civilization starting all over
again! A second chance!

504
01:23:16,045 --> 01:23:18,228
Heh- we'll even build a railway
and tunnel to the coast,

505
01:23:18,956 --> 01:23:20,362
go there for our holidays!

506
01:23:21,203 --> 01:23:23,094
Nothing can stop men like us!

507
01:23:24,001 --> 01:23:25,625
I've made a start already.

508
01:23:26,279 --> 01:23:27,738
Come on down here and have a look.

509
01:23:28,274 --> 01:23:30,750
In the cellar there was a tunnel
scarcely ten yards long.

510
01:23:31,288 --> 01:23:32,877
It had taken him a week to dig.

511
01:23:33,433 --> 01:23:36,167
I could have dug that much in
a day, and I suddenly had

512
01:23:36,595 --> 01:23:40,336
my first inkling of the gulf
between his dreams and his power.

513
01:23:56,485 --> 01:23:59,750
It's doing the working and the
thinking that wears a fellow out.

514
01:24:00,128 --> 01:24:02,944
I'm ready for a bit of a rest.
How about a drink, eh?

515
01:24:03,360 --> 01:24:05,293
Nothing but champagne now
I'm the boss.

516
01:24:06,303 --> 01:24:09,217
We drank, and then he insisted
upon playing cards.

517
01:24:10,129 --> 01:24:12,334
With our species on the edge
of extermination,

518
01:24:12,825 --> 01:24:17,075
with no prospect but a horrible
death, we actually played games.

519
01:24:30,402 --> 01:24:34,300
Later he talked more of his plan,
but I saw flames flashing

520
01:24:34,716 --> 01:24:37,063
in the deep blue night,
red weed glowing,

521
01:24:37,516 --> 01:24:42,364
tripod figures moving distantly,
and I put down my champagne glass.

522
01:24:43,157 --> 01:24:44,439
I felt a traitor to my kind,

523
01:24:45,165 --> 01:24:48,341
and I knew I must leave this
strange dreamer.

524
01:25:07,841 --> 01:25:18,162
Take a look around you at
the world we've come to know

525
01:25:19,850 --> 01:25:29,694
Does it seem to be much more
than a crazy circus show?

526
01:25:32,667 --> 01:25:42,769
Maybe from the madness
something beautiful will grow...

527
01:27:08,304 --> 01:27:10,424
There were a dozen dead bodies
in the Euston road,

528
01:27:11,143 --> 01:27:13,501
their outlines softened by
the black dust.

529
01:27:14,288 --> 01:27:19,367
All was still, houses locked
and empty, shops closed,

530
01:27:20,079 --> 01:27:22,475
but looters had helped themselves
to wine and food,

531
01:27:22,990 --> 01:27:26,331
and outside a jewelers some gold
chains and a watch

532
01:27:26,751 --> 01:27:28,265
were scattered on the pavement.

533
01:28:11,285 --> 01:28:14,318
I stopped, staring towards the sound.

534
01:28:15,192 --> 01:28:19,235
It seemed as if that mighty desert
of houses had found a voice

535
01:28:19,640 --> 01:28:21,354
for its fear and solitude.

536
01:28:52,815 --> 01:28:55,541
The desolating cry worked
upon my mind.

537
01:28:56,575 --> 01:28:58,851
The wailing took possession of me.

538
01:28:59,438 --> 01:29:03,357
I was intensely weary, footsore,
hungry and thirsty.

539
01:29:04,334 --> 01:29:07,343
Why was I wandering alone
in this city of the dead?

540
01:29:07,888 --> 01:29:12,342
Why was I alive when London was
lying in state in its black shroud?

541
01:29:13,116 --> 01:29:18,341
I felt intolerably lonely,
drifting from street to empty street,

542
01:29:18,945 --> 01:29:21,694
drawn inexorably towards that cry.

543
01:30:25,273 --> 01:30:27,494
I saw, over the trees on
Primrose Hill,

544
01:30:27,916 --> 01:30:30,167
the fighting machine from which
the howling came.

545
01:30:30,883 --> 01:30:32,514
I crossed Regent's Canal.

546
01:30:32,966 --> 01:30:38,078
There stood a second machine,
upright, but as still as the first.

547
01:30:53,482 --> 01:30:56,112
Abruptly, the sound ceased.

548
01:30:56,813 --> 01:31:00,708
Suddenly the desolation,
the solitude, became unendurable.

549
01:31:01,422 --> 01:31:04,225
While that voice sounded London
still seemed alive,

550
01:31:04,990 --> 01:31:08,508
now suddenly there was a change,
the passing of something,

551
01:31:08,948 --> 01:31:12,781
and all that remained was
this gaunt quiet.

552
01:31:15,332 --> 01:31:17,489
I looked up, and saw a third machine.

553
01:31:17,943 --> 01:31:21,290
It was erect and motionless,
like the others.

554
01:31:22,968 --> 01:31:28,366
An insane resolve possessed me:
I would give my life to the Martians,

555
01:31:28,881 --> 01:31:30,013
here and now.

556
01:31:44,176 --> 01:31:47,747
I marched recklessly towards
the titan and saw that a multitude

557
01:31:48,160 --> 01:31:50,873
of black birds were circling and
clustering about the hood.

558
01:31:51,378 --> 01:31:54,825
I began running along the road.
I felt no fear, only a wild,

559
01:31:55,250 --> 01:31:57,385
trembling exultation
as I ran up the hill

560
01:31:57,386 --> 01:31:59,520
towards the motionless monster.

561
01:32:00,180 --> 01:32:02,101
Out of the hood hung red shreds,

562
01:32:02,567 --> 01:32:04,295
at which the hungry birds now
pecked and tore.

563
01:32:49,357 --> 01:32:51,356
I scrambled up to the crest
of Primrose hill,

564
01:32:51,978 --> 01:32:53,770
the Martian's camp was below me.

565
01:32:54,536 --> 01:32:57,551
A mighty space it was,
and scattered about it,

566
01:32:58,034 --> 01:33:00,252
in their overturned machines,
were the Martians, dead,

567
01:33:00,795 --> 01:33:03,543
slain after all man's devices
had failed

568
01:33:04,522 --> 01:33:07,474
by the humblest creatures on the
earth: bacteria.

569
01:33:08,147 --> 01:33:11,393
Minute, invisible, bacteria.

570
01:33:25,239 --> 01:33:28,012
Directly the invaders arrived
and drank and fed,

571
01:33:28,862 --> 01:33:31,148
our microscopic allies attacked
them.

572
01:33:31,920 --> 01:33:34,898
From that moment, they were doomed.

573
01:35:11,034 --> 01:35:12,452
The torment was ended.

574
01:35:12,911 --> 01:35:14,460
The people scattered over the
country,

575
01:35:14,879 --> 01:35:16,390
desperate, leaderless, starved,

576
01:35:16,901 --> 01:35:20,646
the thousands who had fled by sea
including the one most dear to me;

577
01:35:21,461 --> 01:35:26,040
all could return, the pulse of life
growing stronger and stronger

578
01:35:26,688 --> 01:35:27,850
would beat again.

579
01:40:37,070 --> 01:40:39,248
As life returns to normal,
the question of another

580
01:40:39,785 --> 01:40:42,101
attack from Mars causes universal
concern.

581
01:40:42,752 --> 01:40:47,038
Is our planet safe, or is this
time of peace merely a reprieve?

582
01:40:47,611 --> 01:40:49,556
It may be that across the immensity
of space,

583
01:40:50,080 --> 01:40:53,694
they have learned their lessons,
and even now await their opportunity.

584
01:40:54,392 --> 01:40:58,422
Perhaps the future belongs not
to us, but to the Martians.

585
01:41:24,695 --> 01:41:29,257
Looking good, going good,
we're getting great pictures

586
01:41:29,757 --> 01:41:31,731
here at NASA control Pasadina.

587
01:41:32,316 --> 01:41:37,032
Landing craft touched down on Mars
28 kilometers from the aim point.

588
01:41:37,855 --> 01:41:39,973
We're looking at a remarkable
landscape,

589
01:41:40,627 --> 01:41:42,378
littered with different kinds
of rocks.

590
01:41:42,781 --> 01:41:45,695
Red, purple... how about that,
Burmuda?

591
01:41:46,394 --> 01:41:49,184
Fantastic. Look at that dune field!

592
01:41:51,090 --> 01:41:53,239
Hey, wait, I- I'm getting a
no-go signal.

593
01:41:54,257 --> 01:41:57,139
Now I'm losing one of the craft.
Hey Burmuda, you getting it?

594
01:41:57,517 --> 01:42:00,788
Nah, lost contact. There's
a lot of dust blowing up there.

595
01:42:02,316 --> 01:42:05,594
Now I lost the second craft.
We got problems.

596
01:42:06,235 --> 01:42:09,534
Full contact lost, Pasadina.
Maybe the antenna's...

597
01:42:11,556 --> 01:42:16,085
What's that flare? See it?
A green flare coming from Mars.

598
01:42:16,717 --> 01:42:20,238
Kind of a green mist behind it.
It's getting closer.

599
01:42:21,179 --> 01:42:25,569
You see it, Burmuda?
Come in, Burmuda!

600
01:42:26,962 --> 01:42:29,883
Houston, come in! What's going on...

601
01:42:31,323 --> 01:42:35,141
tracking station 43 Canberra,
come in Canberra!

602
01:42:36,831 --> 01:42:40,230
tracking station 63,
can you hear me Madrid...

603
01:42:41,771 --> 01:42:44,088
can anybody hear me? Come in...!

604
01:42:44,956 --> 01:42:46,390
Come in...
