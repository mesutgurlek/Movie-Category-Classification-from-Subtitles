00:01:34,530 --> 00:01:38,410
Whoa, nelly! Whoa!
Right here.

2
00:01:47,110 --> 00:01:49,120
- Hi, Jim.
- Hello, Bill. Cold enough?

3
00:01:49,280 --> 00:01:51,660
You're darn right.
You got any passengers?

4
00:01:51,830 --> 00:01:53,910
No. Just a few actors.

5
00:01:54,080 --> 00:01:55,920
- Hiya, neighbor.
- Hiya.

6
00:01:56,080 --> 00:01:58,210
- You a couple of actors?
- That's right.

7
00:01:58,380 --> 00:02:00,380
You don't look like actors.

8
00:02:00,590 --> 00:02:04,050
I got a piece of news for you.
This doesn't look like a town.

9
00:02:04,550 --> 00:02:06,520
- Say, that's a nifty!
- You like that?

10
00:02:06,680 --> 00:02:09,730
What do you think of this?
Know what Julius Caesar said...

11
00:02:09,900 --> 00:02:11,560
...when Brutus stabbed him?
- No.

12
00:02:11,770 --> 00:02:14,320
- Ouch!
- Ouch.

13
00:02:14,610 --> 00:02:16,740
That's all right.
Where did you get that?

14
00:02:16,950 --> 00:02:19,570
That's one of my father's jokes.

15
00:02:19,780 --> 00:02:22,160
What are you, one of your mother's?

16
00:02:22,580 --> 00:02:25,290
Say, he looks like an actor.

17
00:02:25,920 --> 00:02:28,340
You called it, friend.
Harry Palmer, single O.

18
00:02:28,500 --> 00:02:30,630
- How you doing?
- Hi. I'm Jimmy Metcalfe...

19
00:02:30,800 --> 00:02:32,720
How you doing? Glad to see you.

20
00:02:32,880 --> 00:02:36,680
Well, hiya, chicks.
Meet Harry Palmer, headliner.

21
00:02:36,850 --> 00:02:40,100
- Do we have to answer that?
- Bus for the hotel! The hotel bus!

22
00:02:40,270 --> 00:02:41,480
- Is that it?
- Yes, sir.

23
00:02:41,650 --> 00:02:45,110
Go ahead, kids. Get in the bus.
Sid and I will bring the bags.

24
00:02:48,650 --> 00:02:51,450
Hello, Springtime.

25
00:02:52,080 --> 00:02:54,290
Aren't you a little out of season?

26
00:02:56,500 --> 00:02:59,000
Who's the guy with the squirrel
around his neck?

27
00:02:59,170 --> 00:03:03,300
- Single act, name of Palmer.
- His act can't be as funny as that coat.

28
00:03:08,680 --> 00:03:11,390
Hey, how do you like this billing?

29
00:03:11,560 --> 00:03:15,940
"Harry Palmer, America's
foremost comedy juggler and dancer."

30
00:03:16,110 --> 00:03:19,110
That's the way it's gonna read
someday at the Palace too.

31
00:03:19,280 --> 00:03:21,780
Say, how long you been
with this stale act?

32
00:03:21,950 --> 00:03:24,450
Are you kidding?
Jimmy Metcalfe has a great act.

33
00:03:24,620 --> 00:03:26,330
And it's gonna be better too.

34
00:03:26,540 --> 00:03:29,460
Wait till you hear the terrific arrangement
he's buying.

35
00:03:29,630 --> 00:03:32,510
- Arrangement? Where?
- Right here. The orchestra leader.

36
00:03:32,670 --> 00:03:35,510
He writes sensational stuff.

37
00:03:36,220 --> 00:03:39,430
Thanks, kid.
I'll give you a joke sometime.

38
00:03:40,560 --> 00:03:44,020
Lou, you can't expect my girls to dress
way up on the third floor.

39
00:03:44,230 --> 00:03:45,940
- They got changes.
- Sorry, Jimmy.

40
00:03:46,110 --> 00:03:48,570
I hand out dressing rooms
according to billing.

41
00:03:48,740 --> 00:03:51,700
I know, but Palmer won't mind.
He looks like a swell guy.

42
00:03:51,870 --> 00:03:54,580
- Lf it's okay by Palmer, it's okay by me.
- Thanks!

43
00:03:54,740 --> 00:03:58,040
Hey, kids! Kids, it's okay!
We're moving!

44
00:03:58,250 --> 00:04:01,670
- Hiya, maestro. I'm Harry Palmer.
- How do you do?

45
00:04:01,880 --> 00:04:04,010
I hear you got a terrific arrangement.

46
00:04:04,170 --> 00:04:06,430
- How did you hear?
- Jimmy Metcalfe told me.

47
00:04:06,590 --> 00:04:08,140
- He did?
- Sure.

48
00:04:08,300 --> 00:04:10,770
Look, I'm breaking in a new act.

49
00:04:10,930 --> 00:04:13,560
If the arrangement's good,
I'll give you 50 bucks.

50
00:04:13,730 --> 00:04:16,400
- I promised it to Jimmy.
- He won't be needing it.

51
00:04:16,570 --> 00:04:18,740
- That act is gonna fold any day.
- It is?

52
00:04:18,900 --> 00:04:20,780
- Sure.
- Gee whiz.

53
00:04:20,950 --> 00:04:23,120
- What do you say?
- I promised it to Jimmy.

54
00:04:23,280 --> 00:04:26,540
- Fifty bucks.
- I sure can use that 50.

55
00:04:26,700 --> 00:04:28,090
When Jimmy gets the act fixed up...

56
00:04:28,130 --> 00:04:30,150
...we're not gonna have to play
these dumps anymore.

57
00:04:34,760 --> 00:04:37,430
What's the idea of putting her
in my dressing room?

58
00:04:37,640 --> 00:04:40,930
I'm sorry. The young ladies
in Mr. Metcalfe's act got changes.

59
00:04:41,140 --> 00:04:44,440
I know when to be nice to young ladies.
I'm topping this bill...

60
00:04:44,650 --> 00:04:49,280
...and I rate the number one room!
- Okay, Mr. Palmer. Okay.

61
00:04:52,280 --> 00:04:55,240
Sorry, kids. Mr. Palmer insists
on having this room.

62
00:04:55,410 --> 00:04:57,410
You'll have to dress upstairs.

63
00:04:57,580 --> 00:05:01,000
Let's not keep the gentleman waiting.

64
00:05:01,500 --> 00:05:05,130
- After all, he's number one.
- Yeah.

65
00:05:05,550 --> 00:05:07,900
There's nothing lower than number one.

66
00:05:54,860 --> 00:05:57,870
- I bet he bows every 
time he hears thunder.
- Yeah.

67
00:06:39,220 --> 00:06:41,760
- See what I mean?
- I see what you mean. Go on, Lily.

68
00:06:41,930 --> 00:06:44,350
- Say, you know, I was...
- Pardon me.

- Oh, no, no. Nothing like that.
- Well, then what is it?

151
00:14:36,570 --> 00:14:39,240
Well, it just doesn't make sense.

152
00:14:39,410 --> 00:14:42,530
I sit in a nice, warm dormitory,
and you wear yourself out...

153
00:14:42,700 --> 00:14:46,830
...in a lot of Clifton Junctions.
- What kind of talk is that?

154
00:14:47,000 --> 00:14:49,920
- I just saw your act.
- What's the matter with our act?

155
00:14:50,090 --> 00:14:53,130
Oh, nothing. Nothing's the matter with it.
You're great.

156
00:14:53,300 --> 00:14:56,390
It just seems to me
the act isn't getting anywhere.

157
00:14:56,550 --> 00:14:59,470
- If you didn't have me around your neck...
- Listen to me.

158
00:14:59,500 --> 00:15:01,690
You ought to be ashamed,
talking to me like that.

159
00:15:01,850 --> 00:15:04,730
Didn't we make a deal once?
Well, didn't we?

160
00:15:04,900 --> 00:15:08,150
You go through medical school
and pay me back with interest.

161
00:15:08,320 --> 00:15:11,780
This is a fine time to quit.
Your last year. You're doing great.

162
00:15:11,990 --> 00:15:14,870
- I'm not gonna let you quit.
- But, Jo...

163
00:15:15,040 --> 00:15:18,000
What do you want to be?
A no-good tramp or something?

164
00:15:19,420 --> 00:15:21,000
Danny.

165
00:15:22,090 --> 00:15:24,590
You're not working any hardship on me.

166
00:15:24,760 --> 00:15:28,390
Don't you see, honey?
I love it. I'd be doing it anyway.

167
00:15:28,550 --> 00:15:31,060
And you're gonna stay in medical school.

168
00:15:31,230 --> 00:15:34,900
I gotta make sure somebody in this family
is a success.

169
00:15:37,320 --> 00:15:39,570
All aboard!

170
00:15:41,030 --> 00:15:43,530
- So long.
- Don't forget to send that picture.

171
00:15:43,700 --> 00:15:44,950
- Yeah.
- All aboard!

172
00:15:45,120 --> 00:15:46,410
- I better be going.
- Bye.

173
00:15:46,580 --> 00:15:48,210
Goodbye.

174
00:15:49,630 --> 00:15:51,800
We're gonna be all right, you and I.

175
00:15:51,960 --> 00:15:54,970
Goodbye. Goodbye, honey.

176
00:15:55,340 --> 00:15:59,140
- See you at the Palace, kid.
- All right, doctor. It's a date.

177
00:15:59,310 --> 00:16:01,890
- Goodbye.
- Bye.

178
00:16:09,110 --> 00:16:12,110
Hiya, Springtime. Going my way?

179
00:16:12,280 --> 00:16:15,870
Say, you know it's not safe
for a pretty girl to be walking around...

180
00:16:16,080 --> 00:16:17,370
...by herself.

181
00:16:17,540 --> 00:16:19,210
Oh, why don't you come off it?

182
00:16:19,420 --> 00:16:22,040
You know you're gonna wind up
calling me pet names.

183
00:16:22,250 --> 00:16:23,550
Well, of all the...

184
00:16:23,710 --> 00:16:26,170
Tempo, Springtime!
Tempo, tempo!

185
00:16:26,380 --> 00:16:30,100
I didn't like you at 7:00 this morning
and I don't like you now.

186
00:16:30,260 --> 00:16:33,390
If you keep playing your cards right,
I'm gonna hate you.

187
00:16:33,600 --> 00:16:37,190
So why don't you just evaporate,
fade away, dissolve?!

188
00:16:37,360 --> 00:16:39,400
I want to talk to you about business.

189
00:16:39,570 --> 00:16:41,740
- Write me a letter.
- It's too important.

190
00:16:41,900 --> 00:16:44,530
Fancy face, I caught you on-stage
this afternoon.

191
00:16:44,700 --> 00:16:48,250
You sing like a bird, dance like a deer,
look like a wedding ring...

192
00:16:48,460 --> 00:16:50,250
...but that act you're with...

193
00:16:50,460 --> 00:16:53,090
- That's two pins and a lollipop.
- What do you mean?

194
00:16:53,290 --> 00:16:55,380
It's murder. That's what I mean.

195
00:16:55,550 --> 00:16:58,760
Why don't you get bright?
You're too fast for that buggy.

196
00:16:58,930 --> 00:17:01,510
And why don't you mind
your own business?

197
00:17:01,680 --> 00:17:04,600
That's just the point.
It is my business.

198
00:17:05,390 --> 00:17:08,900
Next season, I'm doing a double act,
throwing away the baggy pants.

199
00:17:09,070 --> 00:17:12,110
Don't look now, Springtime.
You're gonna be my partner.

200
00:17:12,280 --> 00:17:13,740
- Oh, I am, huh?
- You said it.

201
00:17:13,910 --> 00:17:17,830
Standing next to me, you'll look
like a million bucks in nickels and dimes.

202
00:17:17,990 --> 00:17:20,500
I can see those three-sheets:
Palmer and Hayden!

203
00:17:20,670 --> 00:17:23,750
- We'll tear down theaters...
- I wouldn't be your partner...

204
00:17:23,920 --> 00:17:26,880
...if they booked us into the Palace
for 51 weeks a year.

205
00:17:27,050 --> 00:17:30,140
- I don't get it. Why?
- Oh, so many reasons.

206
00:17:30,300 --> 00:17:32,970
But you wouldn't understand
any of them.

207
00:17:33,140 --> 00:17:35,980
Gee, I feel sorry for you.

208
00:17:38,150 --> 00:17:39,480
Hey, wait a minute.

209
00:17:39,690 --> 00:17:42,530
Look, Miss Hayden.
I'm sorry.

210
00:17:42,690 --> 00:17:47,280
Your act is all right. Oh, it needs
a little punching up here and there, but...

211
00:17:47,450 --> 00:17:49,660
- Why don't you take this?
- What's that?

212
00:17:49,830 --> 00:17:53,830
It's the arrangement I bought. The one
you and Metcalfe were supposed to get.

213
00:17:54,040 --> 00:17:56,340
- But you were...
- No. Go ahead.

214
00:17:56,550 --> 00:17:59,380
All that big talk about me
breaking down theaters...

215
00:17:59,550 --> 00:18:02,930
...that's strictly small-town talk
on a cold night.

216
00:18:03,100 --> 00:18:07,400
- Oh, I'm sorry. I spoke so...
- No. Forget it. You had me pegged.

217
00:18:07,560 --> 00:18:11,440
I'm never gonna win any blue ribbons
for being a nice guy.

218
00:18:12,360 --> 00:18:15,610
- Well, I...
- Say, would you...?

219
00:18:15,780 --> 00:18:18,530
- Oh, skip it.
- What?

220
00:18:18,700 --> 00:18:22,420
I was gonna ask you to have a cup
of coffee, but after the way I...

221
00:18:22,580 --> 00:18:24,750
Well, I'd love to have a cup of coffee.

222
00:18:24,920 --> 00:18:27,550
- You would?
- Sure.

223
00:18:35,350 --> 00:18:38,730
- Two coffees, please.
- Two coffees. Yes.

224
00:18:39,190 --> 00:18:41,060
How long you been in show business?

225
00:18:41,230 --> 00:18:44,150
I wasn't really in it until Jimmy
gave me a chance. You?

226
00:18:44,320 --> 00:18:47,200
- All my life. Do you like it?
- I love it.

227
00:18:47,370 --> 00:18:49,870
I'd rather sing and dance than, well...

228
00:18:50,040 --> 00:18:52,960
...eat.
- I can tell that by the way you work.

229
00:18:53,120 --> 00:18:55,290
- You're good.
- No. I'm not good yet.

230
00:18:55,460 --> 00:18:59,550
But I will be someday.
You know, I've got kind of a...

231
00:19:00,300 --> 00:19:04,640
- You'd probably laugh at me if I told you.
- No, I wouldn't. What?

232
00:19:04,970 --> 00:19:07,180
Well, I've got kind of a goal
in my mind.

233
00:19:07,350 --> 00:19:09,850
It's the same goal
every vaudeville actor has...

234
00:19:10,020 --> 00:19:12,270
...only I'm really going to get there.

235
00:19:13,020 --> 00:19:15,650
I used to think I'd play the Palace
someday too.

236
00:19:15,820 --> 00:19:18,320
- Well, maybe you will.
- Not me.

237
00:19:18,490 --> 00:19:22,870
You had my number, all right.
Just a cheap tramp comic.

238
00:19:23,040 --> 00:19:26,960
- Oh, I wouldn't say that.
- Why not? It's the truth.

239
00:19:27,170 --> 00:19:30,300
Take that stuff, for instance.
I'm not so sure I can do it.

240
00:19:30,470 --> 00:19:33,590
- Then why'd you buy it?
- I liked it.

241
00:19:33,760 --> 00:19:36,060
It sure is a knockout.

242
00:19:36,220 --> 00:19:37,930
- Want to hear it?
- Sure. Love to.

243
00:19:38,100 --> 00:19:39,140
Okay.

244
00:19:42,190 --> 00:19:45,190
If you've heard my kind 
of voice before,... stop me.

245
00:19:45,360 --> 00:19:47,200
All right.

246
00:19:49,440 --> 00:19:55,900
<i>The Bells are ring...ringing
for me and my gal.</i>

247
00:19:55,930 --> 00:19:57,710
<i>The birds are...</i>

248
00:19:57,750 --> 00:20:00,840
[laughing]  Wait a minute.
You better let me do it.

249
00:20:01,010 --> 00:20:02,970
Okay.

250
00:20:05,100 --> 00:20:07,180
Now...

251
00:20:10,100 --> 00:20:16,970
<i>Ding-dong, ding-dong,
do you hear the bells go ding-dong?</i>

252
00:20:17,000 --> 00:20:20,670
<i>Do you know, do you know
why they're ringin'?</i>

253
00:20:20,710 --> 00:20:24,310
<i>Do you know
why the birds are singin'?</i>

254
00:20:24,350 --> 00:20:30,630
<i>Well you're gonna get a big surprise,
'cause I'm gonna put you wise.</i>

255
00:20:30,810 --> 00:20:37,210
<i>The bells are ringin' 
for me and my gal,</i>

256
00:20:37,980 --> 00:20:44,670
<i>The birds are singin' 
for me and my gal.</i>

257
00:20:44,700 --> 00:20:47,850
<i>Everybody's been knowing</i>

258
00:20:48,410 --> 00:20:51,860
<i>To a wedding they're going</i>

259
00:20:51,900 --> 00:20:55,290
<i>And for weeks 
they've been sewing,</i>

260
00:20:55,320 --> 00:20:58,840
<i>Every Susie and Sal.</i>

261
00:20:58,880 --> 00:21:01,680
<i>They're congregatin'...</i>

262
00:21:01,710 --> 00:21:02,970
Here's the church,

263
00:21:03,010 --> 00:21:05,330
<i>...for me and my gal,</i>

264
00:21:05,370 --> 00:21:07,060
And here's the steeple.

265
00:21:07,090 --> 00:21:08,750
<i>The Parson's waitin'...</i>

266
00:21:08,780 --> 00:21:09,630
Open the door...

267
00:21:09,670 --> 00:21:11,630
<i>...for me and my gal,</i>

268
00:21:11,660 --> 00:21:13,590
and there's the people.

269
00:21:13,620 --> 00:21:14,870
<i>And sometime</i>

270
00:21:14,910 --> 00:21:17,860
<i>We're gonna to build 
a little home for two,</i>

271
00:21:17,890 --> 00:21:21,220
<i>or three or four or more,</i>

272
00:21:21,260 --> 00:21:27,920
<i>In Loveland 
for me and my gal.</i>

273
00:21:28,120 --> 00:21:35,160
<i>The bells are ringing 
for me and my gal.</i>

274
00:21:35,190 --> 00:21:42,160
<i>The birds are singing

00:21:42,200 --> 00:21:49,020
<i>Everybody's been knowing,

276
00:21:49,060 --> 00:21:52,490
<i>And for weeks they've been sewing,</i>

277
00:21:52,830 --> 00:21:55,910
<i>they've been sewing 
something old and something new so,</i>

278
00:21:55,950 --> 00:22:02,440
<i>something that is blue so 
they can make a trousseau for my gal.</i>

279
00:22:02,480 --> 00:22:08,940
<i>They're congregatin' 
for me and my gal. Look, here, why!</i>

280
00:22:08,980 --> 00:22:13,660
<i>that's the Parson 
waitin' for me and my gal.</i>

<i>Loveland for me and my gal...</i>

288
00:22:36,340 --> 00:22:37,440
Remember this one?

289
00:22:41,010 --> 00:22:42,930
And this.

290
00:23:42,470 --> 00:23:44,310
You know what I can't 
eat for breakfast?

291
00:23:44,770 --> 00:23:47,550
Why, no,
I haven't the slightest idea.

292
00:23:47,580 --> 00:23:49,850
Tell me, what can't 
you eat for breakfast?

293
00:23:50,000 --> 00:23:53,030
Luncheon and dinner.
[sigh] Ha! Oh!

294
00:24:16,890 --> 00:24:21,060
Here comes that Loveland again.

295
00:24:21,090 --> 00:24:25,230
<i>In Loveland for me and my gal.</i>

296
00:24:26,820 --> 00:24:30,140
[laughter, applause]

297
00:24:30,580 --> 00:24:32,370
Oh, yes.

298
00:24:33,040 --> 00:24:34,630
Thank you.

299
00:24:34,790 --> 00:24:36,960
Thank you.

300
00:24:37,130 --> 00:24:40,550
- Do we click or don't we?
- That was wonderful! You were perfect!

301
00:24:40,720 --> 00:24:44,720
- What a great finale for a double act!
- We'd have to get a different opening.

302
00:24:44,930 --> 00:24:46,890
- A slower one.
- We come on together.

303
00:24:47,060 --> 00:24:51,400
You go off for a quick change.
I do my soft-shoe routine, and then we...

304
00:24:54,280 --> 00:24:56,280
What's the matter?

305
00:24:59,410 --> 00:25:01,660
I guess I forgot.

306
00:25:32,660 --> 00:25:35,750
- Twenty-six, please.
- Oh, yes.

307
00:25:37,210 --> 00:25:38,920
Thank you.

308
00:25:42,840 --> 00:25:45,970
- Well, it was fun while it lasted.
- Yeah. Here.

309
00:25:46,140 --> 00:25:48,560
No. You keep it. You can do it.
You proved it.

310
00:25:48,720 --> 00:25:50,980
Nope. It takes two.

311
00:25:51,140 --> 00:25:53,310
- Well, please. L...
- It's yours.

312
00:25:53,520 --> 00:25:56,150
Do it with Metcalfe or tear it up.

313
00:25:56,320 --> 00:25:58,700
Anyway, it's yours, nobody else's.

314
00:25:58,860 --> 00:26:00,990
Well, thank you.

315
00:26:01,780 --> 00:26:04,580
- Good night.
- Good night.

316
00:26:08,210 --> 00:26:10,040
Wait a minute.

317
00:26:11,800 --> 00:26:14,680
I played a dirty trick on you.

318
00:26:15,340 --> 00:26:17,720
You better know.
Then you won't feel so bad.

319
00:26:18,180 --> 00:26:20,430
When I offered to give you that song...

320
00:26:20,600 --> 00:26:24,520
...I really didn't mean it.
I was playing you for a sap.

321
00:26:24,690 --> 00:26:28,150
I wanted to fix it so you'd give me
a chance to try out with you.

322
00:26:28,360 --> 00:26:31,700
And all that sob stuff
about me being ashamed of myself...

323
00:26:31,910 --> 00:26:35,540
...that was just a bid for sympathy.
I wasn't ashamed.

324
00:26:35,750 --> 00:26:37,920
I thought I was being pretty cute.

325
00:26:40,750 --> 00:26:43,220
I'm ashamed now though.

326
00:26:43,760 --> 00:26:46,640
And this time, when I say I'm a heel...

327
00:26:47,220 --> 00:26:50,560
...well, I'm not kidding.

328
00:26:56,610 --> 00:26:59,070
Well, I'm glad you told me.

329
00:27:00,450 --> 00:27:02,240
Good night.

330
00:27:04,950 --> 00:27:06,960
Good night.

331
00:27:19,760 --> 00:27:21,100
Hi.

332
00:27:21,270 --> 00:27:24,600
- Well, make yourself at home.
- Thanks. I already have.

333
00:27:24,810 --> 00:27:27,110
Danny get off all right?

334
00:27:27,400 --> 00:27:30,070
He sure took his time about it.
I began to think...

335
00:27:30,240 --> 00:27:31,950
...they were holding you ransom.

336
00:27:32,110 --> 00:27:35,580
Well, I stopped in to get some coffee.

337
00:27:36,410 --> 00:27:39,120
When you didn't come back,
I walked by the station.

338
00:27:39,290 --> 00:27:41,960
I thought maybe I might run into you.

339
00:27:42,380 --> 00:27:44,840
I saw you through a window.

340
00:27:45,340 --> 00:27:46,970
I heard you too.

341
00:27:47,130 --> 00:27:50,600
Gosh, you two were swell together.
Terrific!

342
00:27:50,810 --> 00:27:52,810
Weren't we, Jimmy?

343
00:27:53,480 --> 00:27:56,150
But those after-the-show acts,
they never hold up.

344
00:27:56,360 --> 00:28:00,280
Jo. Did Harry Palmer ask you
to team up with him?

345
00:28:00,440 --> 00:28:02,780
- How'd you know?
- He'd be crazy if he didn't.

346
00:28:02,950 --> 00:28:06,490
I saw you together.
You're a natural for each other.

347
00:28:07,370 --> 00:28:10,210
Look, Jimmy.
I'm kind of sleepy.

348
00:28:10,710 --> 00:28:12,460
What...?

349
00:28:13,750 --> 00:28:15,840
What did you tell him, Jo?

350
00:28:16,380 --> 00:28:18,550
I told him I already had a job.

351
00:28:18,720 --> 00:28:20,300
Yeah?

352
00:28:20,890 --> 00:28:23,060
Well, you haven't.

353
00:28:24,230 --> 00:28:27,690
- What do you mean?
- I'm breaking up the act, Jo.

354
00:28:27,860 --> 00:28:29,820
Oh, no, you're not.

355
00:28:30,030 --> 00:28:33,360
I'm not gonna have you making
noble sacrifices on my account.

356
00:28:33,530 --> 00:28:38,450
Who said anything about your account? And
who said anything about noble sacrifices?

357
00:28:38,620 --> 00:28:41,420
I'm a comic.
I should have known that before.

358
00:28:41,580 --> 00:28:46,670
I don't know what I was messing up my act
with girls and music and stuff like that.

359
00:28:46,840 --> 00:28:48,340
Besides...

360
00:28:48,510 --> 00:28:52,140
...l've got a new idea
that I'd like to try out with Sid.

361
00:28:52,310 --> 00:28:54,270
Just the two of us.

362
00:28:55,480 --> 00:28:59,650
Well, what made you decide all this
tonight?

363
00:28:59,820 --> 00:29:03,860
I should have thought of it long ago,
but you know me, putting things off...

364
00:29:04,030 --> 00:29:06,870
You know how it's been.
The act's not doing well.

365
00:29:07,030 --> 00:29:09,910
I had a wire from Eddie,
said he can't get us bookings.

366
00:29:10,080 --> 00:29:12,000
Lily's talking about leaving, and...

367
00:29:12,170 --> 00:29:14,960
Well, it's the only thing to do, that's all.

368
00:29:16,130 --> 00:29:19,090
If I thought you were trying
to pave the way for me...

369
00:29:19,260 --> 00:29:22,890
Now, wait a minute. What are you
talking about? This is business.

370
00:29:23,810 --> 00:29:27,770
No fooling. I wouldn't joke
about a thing like that.

371
00:29:29,440 --> 00:29:31,480
It's good business too.

372
00:29:31,650 --> 00:29:33,650
For everybody.

373
00:29:43,630 --> 00:29:46,380
Oh, Jimmy. You're sweet.

374
00:29:46,550 --> 00:29:50,510
- You're just as sweet as they come.
- Do you want to know something?

375
00:29:50,680 --> 00:29:53,640
That goes for you too, double.

376
00:29:55,850 --> 00:29:58,350
I'm gonna kind of miss you, kiddo.

377
00:29:58,520 --> 00:30:01,020
Working with you hasn't been
like working at all.

378
00:30:01,190 --> 00:30:04,950
- It's been more like...
- Palmer and Hayden.

379
00:30:05,110 --> 00:30:07,820
Gee, think of that.

380
00:30:07,990 --> 00:30:11,040
Palmer and Hayden.
It's the way we're gonna bill ourselves.

381
00:30:11,200 --> 00:30:13,160
- Isn't that wonderful?
- Sounds swell.

382
00:30:13,330 --> 00:30:17,130
Oh, I gotta tell him now, right away.

383
00:30:40,230 --> 00:30:45,040
<i>When you wore a tulip, 
a big yellow tulip,</i>

384
00:30:45,070 --> 00:30:48,460
<i>and I wore a big red rose.</i>

385
00:30:48,500 --> 00:30:51,820
<i> When you caressed me,</i>

386
00:30:51,860 --> 00:30:58,620
<i>'twas then Heaven blessed me, 
what a blessing no one knows.</i>

387
00:30:58,660 --> 00:31:03,620
<i>You made life cheery 
when you called me Dearie,</i>

388
00:31:03,650 --> 00:31:07,150
<i>'twas down where the bluegrass grows,</i>

389
00:31:07,180 --> 00:31:10,610
<i>your lips were sweeter than julep,</i>

390
00:31:10,640 --> 00:31:17,500
<i>when you wore a tulip, 
and I wore a big red rose.</i>

391
00:32:18,540 --> 00:32:19,730
- Don't you think 
you better go to bed?

392
00:32:19,770 --> 00:32:21,590
Yeah. I guess so.

393
00:32:23,210 --> 00:32:24,900
How I hate those man-traps.

394
00:32:24,930 --> 00:32:27,110
Oh, well, 
you take the lower tonight.

395
00:32:27,760 --> 00:32:30,220
I wouldn't know how to act in one.
Hey, George.

396
00:32:30,390 --> 00:32:32,940
- Whenever you're ready.
- Yes, sir.

397
00:32:35,270 --> 00:32:37,190
Hey, listen to this.

398
00:32:37,360 --> 00:32:39,950
"Eddie Melton has booked Jimmy Metcalfe,
comic...

399
00:32:40,110 --> 00:32:42,370
...with Sid Simms
on the Orpheum circuit.

400
00:32:42,570 --> 00:32:45,540
Metcalfe opens the 19th in Minneapolis."

401
00:32:45,750 --> 00:32:50,080
Isn't that wonderful? Look.
See? Here.

402
00:32:53,260 --> 00:32:56,720
- I'd like a crack at some Orpheum time.
- Oh, now, Harry.

403
00:32:56,890 --> 00:32:59,260
Well, I'm sick of playing
these two-bit towns.

404
00:32:59,430 --> 00:33:02,560
- Chicago isn't a two-bit town.
- The part we're playing is.

405
00:33:02,770 --> 00:33:06,190
Why must everything happen here
and now? You think that we have...

406
00:33:06,400 --> 00:33:08,530
Yes, sir. I'll make it right up for you.

407
00:33:10,700 --> 00:33:13,530
- I'll take that.
- I'll go back and have a cigarette.

408
00:33:13,700 --> 00:33:16,660
- Let me know when he's finished, will you?
- Yeah.

409
00:33:39,320 --> 00:33:44,070
- This a private car, sir.
- Excuse me. I was looking for the club...

410
00:33:47,410 --> 00:33:50,540
Oh, I'm sorry. I was just
on my way back for a cigarette.

411
00:33:50,710 --> 00:33:55,300
- I must have got off at the wrong floor.
- Why don't you have your cigarette here?

412
00:33:55,510 --> 00:33:58,800
- Well, thanks a lot, but I...
- Please.

413
00:33:58,970 --> 00:34:03,140
- I'd like one myself.
- Well, thanks. That's mighty nice of you.

414
00:34:03,350 --> 00:34:06,190
- That's all, Celeste.
- Yes, ma'am.

415
00:34:09,400 --> 00:34:11,740
Oh, excuse me.

416
00:34:17,620 --> 00:34:19,120
Drink?

417
00:34:19,330 --> 00:34:23,670
- Sure.
- Chartreuse, creme de menthe, vieille cure?

418
00:34:23,880 --> 00:34:25,210
Surprise me.

419
00:34:27,840 --> 00:34:30,390
- There you are.
- Thanks.

420
00:34:30,890 --> 00:34:34,350
Say, this sure beats a club car, all right.

421
00:34:35,060 --> 00:34:37,980
And better-looking people too.

422
00:34:47,080 --> 00:34:49,830
Say! You're not...?

423
00:34:50,660 --> 00:34:54,210
Well, I'll be darned. Imagine me,
sitting here with Eve Minard!

424
00:34:54,420 --> 00:34:56,170
Say, you're not really...?

425
00:34:56,710 --> 00:35:01,430
How do you like that? Guess you
never heard of me. Harry Palmer.

426
00:35:01,760 --> 00:35:04,720
- Harry Palmer?
- Of Palmer and Hayden.

427
00:35:04,890 --> 00:35:08,400
Oh, yes, certainly.
A fellow artist.

428
00:35:08,940 --> 00:35:11,110
Nothing less. Get a load of this.

429
00:35:24,790 --> 00:35:26,630
- Very nice.
- You get the rough idea.

430
00:35:26,800 --> 00:35:29,590
- I must come and see you.
- I open in Chicago tomorrow.

431
00:35:29,800 --> 00:35:32,890
- A full week too.
- Really? I open there tomorrow.

432
00:35:33,050 --> 00:35:35,520
- At the Majestic?
- Well, no.

433
00:35:35,680 --> 00:35:38,100
They booked me into
a smaller house this time.

434
00:35:38,270 --> 00:35:41,360
- It's a good one though, for its size.
- Oh, that's fine.

435
00:35:41,520 --> 00:35:44,650
Chicago seems to be much
more inviting now.

436
00:35:44,820 --> 00:35:50,160
Well, the pleasure's all mine. If you want
to see the town, I'm your man.

437
00:35:50,330 --> 00:35:54,500
Chicago, Boston, Detroit,
they're all the same. Except New York.

438
00:35:54,670 --> 00:35:58,340
- That is a city.
- I suppose you've played the Palace.

439
00:35:58,500 --> 00:36:01,010
Palace? Which one?

440
00:36:01,590 --> 00:36:05,220
Which one?
Oh, there's only one real Palace.

441
00:36:05,390 --> 00:36:08,640
- New York.
- Oh, yes. Yes, I've played there.

442
00:36:08,810 --> 00:36:11,360
And I have a return engagement
before I sail.

443
00:36:11,520 --> 00:36:13,150
Do you like to play there?

444
00:36:15,030 --> 00:36:18,410
Yes. I like to play there very much.

445
00:36:22,290 --> 00:36:25,210
- More?
- Sure. Why not?

446
00:36:26,210 --> 00:36:28,750
Come to think about it,
I never caught your act.

447
00:36:28,920 --> 00:36:31,630
- No?
- I know that you sing and all that...

448
00:36:31,800 --> 00:36:33,840
...but what kind of stuff?
- Many kinds.

449
00:36:34,050 --> 00:36:38,390
- Rags or ballads?
- As you like. I have it!

450
00:36:38,600 --> 00:36:41,850
You danced for me,
I will sing for you, if I may.

451
00:36:42,060 --> 00:36:44,480
- That'd be great.
- What will you like to hear?

452
00:36:44,650 --> 00:36:48,160
Don't make it too highbrow.
You gotta gauge your audience.

453
00:36:48,320 --> 00:36:52,580
- Give them something they'll understand.
- I think you'll understand this.

454
00:36:52,740 --> 00:36:54,750
Most people do.

455
00:38:30,540 --> 00:38:33,000
- Say, that's wonderful!
- You like that?

456
00:38:33,210 --> 00:38:35,800
Do I? It's terrific!
Let's have an encore.

457
00:38:35,970 --> 00:38:39,560
- Lf you wish.
- Certainly, I wish.

458
00:40:09,300 --> 00:40:13,140
- Oh, hello, Jo. How do you feel?
- How do you feel?

459
00:40:13,390 --> 00:40:15,730
Here's the other half of my act,
Miss Hayden.

460
00:40:15,890 --> 00:40:18,310
- Won't you come in?
- Jo, this is...

461
00:40:18,480 --> 00:40:22,360
Yes. Miss Minard.
I play your records over and over again.

462
00:40:22,530 --> 00:40:24,200
- I love them.
- Thank you.

463
00:40:24,360 --> 00:40:27,030
Well, I was just about
to come on back and turn in.

464
00:40:27,200 --> 00:40:30,410
- Thanks for the song. It was swell.
- I hope you won't forget.

465
00:40:30,580 --> 00:40:33,580
- I'll be at the Majestic.
- Forget?

466
00:40:34,500 --> 00:40:37,170
- Well, good night.
- Good night.

467
00:40:37,340 --> 00:40:40,180
- Good night.
- Good night.

468
00:40:42,300 --> 00:40:45,140
- Quite a dame, isn't she?
- Yes, she is.

469
00:40:45,310 --> 00:40:48,520
Four grand a week. Oh, boy.

470
00:40:49,060 --> 00:40:53,950
- Well, good night, kid.
- Good night, Harry.

471
00:41:21,400 --> 00:41:23,150
- Come in.
- Ladies and gentlemen...

472
00:41:23,320 --> 00:41:27,070
...I now give you Jimmy Metcalfe!
- Jimmy, darling!

473
00:41:27,240 --> 00:41:30,500
How are you, Jo? Let me look at you.
My golly, you look swell!

474
00:41:30,540 --> 00:41:34,670
- You're supposed to be in Minneapolis.
- We closed last night. A mild sensation.

475
00:41:34,830 --> 00:41:37,710
- How is your act?
- Oh, fine.

476
00:41:37,880 --> 00:41:41,050
Come on. Sit here, Jimmy.
Gee, it's good to see you.

477
00:41:41,220 --> 00:41:44,560
Well, it's good to see you...
Say, who's this, General Pershing?

478
00:41:44,760 --> 00:41:47,100
No. That's Danny.
He's enlisted.

479
00:41:47,270 --> 00:41:49,190
No! What about the medical career?

480
00:41:49,350 --> 00:41:52,400
- He's going back after the war.
- Doesn't he look swell?

481
00:41:52,570 --> 00:41:53,820
- Yeah.
- Where's Harry?

482
00:41:53,990 --> 00:41:55,490
Harry?

483
00:41:56,860 --> 00:41:59,530
He's out with a friend.

484
00:42:00,030 --> 00:42:02,290
You'll never guess who either.

485
00:42:02,710 --> 00:42:05,670
- Eve Minard.
- Eve Minard!

486
00:42:05,830 --> 00:42:08,800
Say, he's traveling
in pretty fast company, isn't he?

487
00:42:08,960 --> 00:42:11,800
Yeah. Well...

488
00:42:11,970 --> 00:42:13,930
...you know Harry.

489
00:42:14,800 --> 00:42:16,810
She's a big success...

490
00:42:16,970 --> 00:42:19,140
...and she's pretty...

491
00:42:19,310 --> 00:42:21,020
...and, well...

492
00:42:21,190 --> 00:42:24,820
Jo, you're in love
with that guy, aren't you?

493
00:42:25,240 --> 00:42:29,070
Harry? Oh, no.

494
00:42:30,200 --> 00:42:34,080
- I'm not in love.
- Hey, hey, shorty.

495
00:42:35,040 --> 00:42:40,550
Remember me? Jimmy Metcalfe, the fella
that played Clifton Junction with you?

496
00:42:41,220 --> 00:42:43,090
Oh, Jimmy.

497
00:42:44,180 --> 00:42:47,310
It's way down deep inside of me.

498
00:42:47,850 --> 00:42:52,810
He's wrong, and I love him.
He's right, and I love him.

499
00:42:53,860 --> 00:42:55,690
It's no good.

500
00:42:57,990 --> 00:43:01,740
Gee, what do you do
when you love somebody so much...

501
00:43:02,290 --> 00:43:04,870
...and they don't
even know you're around?

502
00:43:06,880 --> 00:43:08,840
I don't know, Jo.

503
00:43:09,710 --> 00:43:12,720
I guess you just
keep right on loving them.

504
00:43:20,060 --> 00:43:21,560
Watch your step.

505
00:43:30,700 --> 00:43:33,490
I forgot to ask you.
When do you open in St. Paul?

506
00:43:33,660 --> 00:43:36,290
- St. Paul?
- Say, Jo.

507
00:43:36,460 --> 00:43:38,920
- Well, hello, stranger.
- Hi, Harry.

508
00:43:39,090 --> 00:43:41,420
- I hear you're doing all right.
- Not so bad.

509
00:43:41,590 --> 00:43:44,550
- Like to see a fella get ahead.
- You've got a few minutes.

510
00:43:44,720 --> 00:43:47,600
You better go on first
and give me a chance to change.

511
00:43:47,760 --> 00:43:50,060
All right. But hurry, please.

512
00:43:53,190 --> 00:43:56,530
Jo. How about having supper with me
after the show tonight?

513
00:43:56,690 --> 00:44:00,660
Fine. We have to catch a train at midnight.
We open tomorrow in Milwaukee.

514
00:44:00,820 --> 00:44:03,580
- Do you suppose he'd like to come?
- I'll ask him.

515
00:44:03,740 --> 00:44:05,790
- I'll see you later.
- All right, Jimmy.

516
00:44:05,950 --> 00:44:08,830
Make it good, shorty.
I'll be out front watching you.

517
00:44:17,010 --> 00:44:20,890
Harry? Jimmy wants to know if we
can have supper later. Can you make it?

518
00:44:21,060 --> 00:44:23,770
I'd like to,
but I got a date with Eve.

519
00:44:24,810 --> 00:44:28,490
Oh, well, you better hurry
or you'll miss your cue.

520
00:44:35,200 --> 00:44:38,390
<i>After you've gone and left me cryin',</i>

521
00:44:38,430 --> 00:44:41,620
<i>after you've gone there's no denyin',</i>

522
00:44:41,650 --> 00:44:44,780
<i>you'll feel blue, you'll feel sad.</i>

523
00:44:44,810 --> 00:44:48,030
<i>You'll miss the dearest 
pal you've ever had.</i>

524
00:44:48,070 --> 00:44:51,240
<i>There'll come a time, 
now don't forget it.</i>

525
00:44:51,280 --> 00:44:54,410
<i>There'll come a time 
when you'll regret it,</i>

526
00:44:54,450 --> 00:44:57,860
<i>someday, when you grow lonely</i>

527
00:44:57,890 --> 00:44:59,410
<i>Your heart will break like mine</i>

528
00:44:59,440 --> 00:45:02,950
<i>and you'll want me only 
after you've gone,</i>

529
00:45:02,980 --> 00:45:10,830
<i>after you've gone away.</i>

530
00:45:11,880 --> 00:45:21,520
<i>After you've gone 
and left me cryin',</i>

531
00:45:22,090 --> 00:45:30,920
<i>after you've gone 
there's no denyin',</i>

532
00:45:31,530 --> 00:45:35,580
<i>you're gonna feel blue,</i>

533
00:45:35,620 --> 00:45:38,170
<i>and you're gonna feel sad,</i>

534
00:45:38,210 --> 00:45:40,690
<i>you're gonna feel bad.</i>

535
00:45:40,730 --> 00:45:44,850
<i>And you'll miss, and you'll miss,</i>

536
00:45:44,890 --> 00:45:51,650
<i>and you'll miss the 
bestest pal you ever had.</i>

537
00:45:52,720 --> 00:46:01,180
<i>There'll come a time, 
now don't forget it,</i>

538
00:46:01,340 --> 00:46:10,520
<i>there'll come a time 
when you'll regret it.</i>

539
00:46:14,620 --> 00:46:20,880
<i>Baby, think what you're doin'. 
I'm gonna haunt you so,</i>

540
00:46:20,920 --> 00:46:27,150
<i>I'm gonna taunt you so.
It's gonna drive you to ruin</i>

541
00:46:27,180 --> 00:46:37,100
<i> after you've gone,
after you've gone away.</i>

542
00:46:47,550 --> 00:46:50,430
- That will be all, Celeste.
- Yes, ma'am.

543
00:47:14,960 --> 00:47:16,590
Miss Minard.

544
00:47:16,750 --> 00:47:19,220
- Oh, hello.
- Hello.

545
00:47:19,380 --> 00:47:23,430
- Could I see you a moment, please?
- I'm sorry, but I...

546
00:47:24,560 --> 00:47:26,020
I expect a guest.

547
00:47:27,100 --> 00:47:31,230
Yes, I know, but this will
only take a moment. Please.

548
00:47:43,330 --> 00:47:45,580
Well, what is it, my dear?

549
00:47:47,090 --> 00:47:49,970
Well, I wanted to talk to you...

550
00:47:52,380 --> 00:47:53,760
Yes?

551
00:47:55,930 --> 00:47:57,770
I thought...

552
00:48:00,600 --> 00:48:02,570
I'm sorry.

553
00:48:03,980 --> 00:48:07,780
- Lf you'll excuse me.
- Wait a moment.

554
00:48:08,450 --> 00:48:12,830
I know you have something to say,
and I would like to hear it.

555
00:48:13,410 --> 00:48:15,120
What is it?

556
00:48:15,710 --> 00:48:17,750
Sit down, please.

557
00:48:20,340 --> 00:48:26,350
I had my speech all memorized, and it
was gonna be pretty dramatic, I guess.

558
00:48:28,140 --> 00:48:30,310
But I got stage fright.

559
00:48:32,650 --> 00:48:34,190
It's about Harry.

560
00:48:35,940 --> 00:48:38,780
You see, I love him.

561
00:48:40,530 --> 00:48:44,080
And you're such a big person,
that I thought...

562
00:48:45,160 --> 00:48:48,380
Well, it's hard to say, but...

563
00:48:48,540 --> 00:48:49,880
...I love him.

564
00:48:51,340 --> 00:48:53,300
And you're worried about me?

565
00:48:54,590 --> 00:48:57,930
No. It's not that.

566
00:48:58,100 --> 00:49:01,190
- But...
- You needn't worry, my dear.

567
00:49:01,810 --> 00:49:03,690
I have no designs on him.

568
00:49:07,530 --> 00:49:08,820
Thank you.

569
00:49:09,990 --> 00:49:13,700
- I hope you don't think that I just...
- Don't apologize, Miss Hayden.

570
00:49:14,290 --> 00:49:20,710
I loved someone like you love Harry, and I
didn't realize it until a long time afterwards.

571
00:49:20,880 --> 00:49:22,840
Much too long.

572
00:49:23,220 --> 00:49:26,050
But I should have done
what you're doing now.

573
00:49:27,260 --> 00:49:29,060
Thank you.

574
00:49:31,140 --> 00:49:35,690
- But I'm sorry you love him so much.
- Why?

575
00:49:35,860 --> 00:49:39,570
- Because he isn't worth it.
- Oh, no, you're wrong. He's...

576
00:49:39,740 --> 00:49:42,450
- He's...
- He's an opportunist...

577
00:49:42,620 --> 00:49:47,250
...an egotistical actor who
will do anything to get what he wants.

578
00:49:47,420 --> 00:49:50,590
He'll make you very unhappy
one day, my dear.

579
00:49:50,750 --> 00:49:54,260
Oh, no, you're wrong.
Harry isn't bad.

580
00:49:54,430 --> 00:49:57,550
I know because
I'm closer to him than anyone.

581
00:49:57,720 --> 00:50:00,810
- I know.
- You know.

582
00:50:01,480 --> 00:50:04,730
He'd leave you in a minute
if I made him an offer.

583
00:50:05,610 --> 00:50:10,070
- Oh, I don't believe that.
- Would you like to have me try?

584
00:50:10,950 --> 00:50:13,530
Oh, no, I don't believe that.

585
00:50:17,120 --> 00:50:20,590
It might be better to get hurt
all at once and get it over with.

586
00:50:20,790 --> 00:50:23,760
- I'm not afraid.
- Shall I ask him?

587
00:50:23,960 --> 00:50:25,760
Well, I...

588
00:50:25,930 --> 00:50:28,930
You can get to the elevator this way.

589
00:50:31,310 --> 00:50:35,480
- I am afraid.
- Go on. Quickly!

590
00:50:45,990 --> 00:50:49,920
- Hello, Eve. Here's Adam.
- Good evening, Harry.

591
00:50:57,680 --> 00:51:02,140
- Say, what are we celebrating?
- Harry, I have a surprise for you.

592
00:51:02,310 --> 00:51:06,810
- Well, come on. Let's have it.
- How would you like to join my act?

593
00:51:08,650 --> 00:51:12,150
- What?
- How would you like to join my act?

594
00:51:12,360 --> 00:51:16,410
- Come on, Eve. You're giving it to me.
- No, no. I'm very serious.

595
00:51:17,950 --> 00:51:19,500
You are?

596
00:51:20,290 --> 00:51:23,670
You're asking if I want to tour with you
and play the Palace?

597
00:51:23,840 --> 00:51:25,170
Yes.

598
00:51:26,090 --> 00:51:28,010
Holy...

599
00:51:29,800 --> 00:51:33,350
Hallelujah! Wait till I tell Jo!

600
00:51:34,180 --> 00:51:35,520
Jo.

601
00:51:35,730 --> 00:51:37,610
You want her to go too, don't you?

602
00:51:38,190 --> 00:51:44,660
Well, she's probably very talented,
but, after all, I'm a singer myself.

603
00:51:49,160 --> 00:51:53,090
Oh, well,
that's a different proposition.

604
00:51:55,590 --> 00:51:58,470
- Gee, I...
- Well, then let's forget about it.

605
00:51:58,800 --> 00:52:02,100
Hey, wait a minute.
Who said anything about forgetting?

606
00:52:02,260 --> 00:52:04,390
You don't know Jo.

607
00:52:05,060 --> 00:52:09,900
She's the top of the deck. She wouldn't
stand in my way. She's a trouper.

608
00:52:10,780 --> 00:52:12,610
When do we start?

609
00:52:13,110 --> 00:52:16,820
- Tomorrow.
- Tomorrow?

610
00:52:21,210 --> 00:52:26,170
Well, what's holding us up?
Come on. Let's have a drink on it.

611
00:52:30,300 --> 00:52:34,390
Here's to Harry Palmer,
heading for the Palace.

612
00:52:36,730 --> 00:52:39,190
- Harry.
- Yeah?

613
00:52:39,350 --> 00:52:42,280
When you see Miss Hayden,
tell her something for me.

614
00:52:42,440 --> 00:52:44,030
Sure.

615
00:52:45,240 --> 00:52:47,070
Tell her...

616
00:52:48,450 --> 00:52:50,410
...l'm sorry.

617
00:53:04,350 --> 00:53:05,970
Come in.

618
00:53:06,560 --> 00:53:08,230
- Hello.
- Hello.

619
00:53:08,390 --> 00:53:11,520
- You packed?
- No.

620
00:53:11,690 --> 00:53:15,820
- Train leaves at 12:30, you know.
- Yeah, I know.

621
00:53:16,030 --> 00:53:18,660
Look at this.
Looks like the rats have been at it.

622
00:53:18,870 --> 00:53:21,080
You'd think that in a city like Chicago...

623
00:53:21,240 --> 00:53:25,210
...they'd know how to launder a blouse.
- Yeah.

624
00:53:27,090 --> 00:53:28,880
Say, Jo.

625
00:53:30,880 --> 00:53:33,470
I want to ask you sort of a question.

626
00:53:35,140 --> 00:53:37,560
Supposing somebody had been offered
a chance...

627
00:53:37,770 --> 00:53:41,020
...to do something they'd been wanting
to do for a long time.

628
00:53:42,570 --> 00:53:44,030
Yeah?

629
00:53:44,940 --> 00:53:50,120
Well, supposing their accepting this offer
meant hurting somebody else maybe.

630
00:53:57,210 --> 00:53:59,960
Well, what would you do?

631
00:54:01,880 --> 00:54:03,890
Oh, I don't know.

632
00:54:05,010 --> 00:54:09,140
I guess it would depend on how important
the thing was to me.

633
00:54:10,900 --> 00:54:13,860
And if it was really important...

634
00:54:16,320 --> 00:54:18,860
...I guess I'd go ahead and do it.

635
00:54:22,040 --> 00:54:24,910
- You would?
- Sure.

636
00:54:25,080 --> 00:54:29,380
- You only live once, you know.
- Yeah, I know...

637
00:54:29,550 --> 00:54:32,720
...but it's kind of hard making
up your mind.

638
00:54:41,310 --> 00:54:44,610
It's funny, you bringing up
a question like that.

639
00:54:45,820 --> 00:54:48,530
I've got kind of the same problem.

640
00:54:49,320 --> 00:54:53,870
- And it is hard too.
- What do you mean?

641
00:54:54,830 --> 00:54:57,250
- Harry...
- Yeah?

642
00:54:58,460 --> 00:55:01,460
...Jimmy wants me
to come back in his act.

643
00:55:01,670 --> 00:55:03,300
Yeah?

644
00:55:05,390 --> 00:55:07,600
Do you want to go back to him?

645
00:55:08,720 --> 00:55:11,390
Well, I don't know. I...

646
00:55:11,560 --> 00:55:14,150
He made me
a pretty good offer.

647
00:55:15,770 --> 00:55:19,360
Well, after all, we...

648
00:55:19,530 --> 00:55:22,620
We all want to get ahead,
you know?

649
00:55:22,780 --> 00:55:28,000
- I mean, that's only human.
- Well, look, Jo.

650
00:55:28,830 --> 00:55:33,380
I don't want to stand in your way.
If you want to go, go ahead and go.

651
00:55:33,800 --> 00:55:37,470
- Honest?
- Sure. Go right ahead.

652
00:55:39,220 --> 00:55:42,480
You're not just trying to be nice,
are you?

653
00:55:42,650 --> 00:55:46,440
No, of course not!
Look, there's no use kidding ourselves.

654
00:55:46,610 --> 00:55:49,950
We both know things haven't panned out
as well as we thought.

655
00:55:50,110 --> 00:55:53,370
So if you can get a break,
go ahead, take it.

656
00:55:56,120 --> 00:56:01,090
Oh, come on, Springtime.
No hearts and flowers. Not from you.

657
00:56:01,250 --> 00:56:05,090
- Look, we're both gonna be on top.
- Sure.

658
00:56:05,760 --> 00:56:07,890
Good luck, Jo...

659
00:56:08,050 --> 00:56:09,850
...and lots of it.

660
00:56:11,770 --> 00:56:14,440
Hey, what's the big idea?

661
00:56:15,190 --> 00:56:18,900
Say, you're not crying
because you feel sorry for me, are you?

662
00:56:19,440 --> 00:56:23,910
There's no need to do that because tonight
I was over at Eve's, and she asked...

663
00:56:25,450 --> 00:56:28,620
Oh, Jo, please don't cry.

664
00:56:28,790 --> 00:56:32,420
- Please. I'm not worth it, I tell you.
- I can't help it.

665
00:56:32,630 --> 00:56:35,260
Honey, I wish you'd stop.

666
00:56:35,420 --> 00:56:38,260
Oh, please, darling, please.

667
00:56:40,310 --> 00:56:44,100
- Harry, Harry.
- Oh, honey.

668
00:56:58,910 --> 00:57:01,960
Say, what hit us?

669
00:57:03,500 --> 00:57:06,050
Oh, it hit me a long time ago.

670
00:57:08,340 --> 00:57:10,640
Well, I'll be darned.

671
00:57:14,560 --> 00:57:17,400
- Harry.
- Yeah.

672
00:57:18,020 --> 00:57:21,740
What was it Eve asked you to do tonight?

673
00:57:23,280 --> 00:57:25,820
Oh, forget it.

674
00:57:26,870 --> 00:57:31,000
We gotta get going! We gotta make
that train, and you gotta help me pack!

675
00:57:31,420 --> 00:57:34,670
The nerve of that Metcalfe,
trying to break up my act...

676
00:57:34,840 --> 00:57:38,880
...and trying to steal my girl too.
I'll push his face in.

677
00:57:39,050 --> 00:57:42,760
The time I've wasted. Why didn't you
tell me I was in love with you?

678
00:57:42,930 --> 00:57:45,690
I didn't know,
and I can hardly believe it now.

679
00:57:45,850 --> 00:57:48,610
I'll make you believe it, all right.

680
00:57:50,900 --> 00:57:52,900
Hey, what's this?

681
00:57:59,040 --> 00:58:02,920
Look! "Palmer and Hayden
booked into Palace New York...

682
00:58:03,080 --> 00:58:05,800
...first week in September.
Congratulations, Eddie."

683
00:58:05,960 --> 00:58:08,420
- Harry!
- Is this our lucky day, or isn't it?

684
00:58:08,590 --> 00:58:12,720
First we fall in love, and now this!
We're on the big time, baby.

685
00:58:12,930 --> 00:58:15,730
We're on the big time.
We're gonna play the Palace!

686
00:58:15,890 --> 00:58:18,560
- The Palace!
- It would have been wonderful anyway...

687
00:58:18,770 --> 00:58:21,440
...but now it's even more wonderful!

688
00:58:23,400 --> 00:58:24,740
Oh, Harry, look out!

689
00:58:24,910 --> 00:58:27,120
Know what we'll do
after the first matinee?

690
00:58:27,280 --> 00:58:29,410
- Have dinner?
- We're gonna get married.

691
00:58:29,620 --> 00:58:32,420
Married. Harry!

692
00:58:36,670 --> 00:58:38,590
Oh, darling!

693
00:58:59,290 --> 00:59:04,670
- Well, here you are at last.
- Take a look at it. Amateur night is over.

694
00:59:12,970 --> 00:59:15,010
Take the elevator
to your dressing room.

695
00:59:15,180 --> 00:59:16,770
- Thank you very much.
- Jimmy!

696
00:59:16,930 --> 00:59:18,560
- Hey, Jo!
- Hello!

697
00:59:18,730 --> 00:59:21,610
- Well, I'll be two ifs and a but.
- Hello!

698
00:59:21,770 --> 00:59:24,530
- Glad to see you!
- Are you opening here today too?

699
00:59:24,690 --> 00:59:26,990
- What do you mean, "too"?
- What do you know?

700
00:59:27,160 --> 00:59:29,780
After all this time,
we're all playing the Palace.

701
00:59:29,950 --> 00:59:32,620
- I hope you have to follow us on!
- Listen to him.

702
00:59:32,790 --> 00:59:35,130
We'd better get
our dressing room key.

703
00:59:35,290 --> 00:59:36,710
Palmer and Hayden, please.

704
00:59:36,880 --> 00:59:40,880
And after the matinee,
we'll just be using one dressing room.

705
00:59:43,300 --> 00:59:46,850
Say, you don't mean to tell me
you're gonna marry this lug?

706
00:59:47,100 --> 00:59:50,400
- Well, only for 150 years or so.
- What do you know?

707
00:59:50,560 --> 00:59:54,190
Open at the Palace, and close
at the little church around the corner.

708
00:59:54,360 --> 00:59:58,200
My gosh, Harry, that's swell.
And I hope you're a hit in both places.

709
00:59:58,360 --> 01:00:00,490
Thanks, Jimmy.

710
01:00:00,660 --> 01:00:04,370
- Isn't anybody gonna give a party?
- Sure, somebody's gonna give a...

711
01:00:04,540 --> 01:00:06,710
I'm gonna give a party after the show.

712
01:00:06,880 --> 01:00:12,010
- Wonderful! Danny will be in from camp too.
- There's no Palmer and Hayden here.

713
01:00:12,170 --> 01:00:13,840
- What?
- I don't see the name.

714
01:00:14,010 --> 01:00:16,010
It's gotta be, we open this afternoon.

715
01:00:16,180 --> 01:00:20,520
Well, it is not on my list...
Oh, Mr. Waring?

716
01:00:21,230 --> 01:00:23,900
- He won't give us our keys.
- We're Palmer and Hayden.

717
01:00:24,110 --> 01:00:26,530
Palmer and Hayden?
You're not booked in here.

718
01:00:26,690 --> 01:00:30,070
- We're not booked?
- There must be some mistake.

719
01:00:31,080 --> 01:00:33,290
- Well, so here we are.
- Eddie.

720
01:00:33,450 --> 01:00:36,750
Hello, Harry. Hello, Jo.
Say, you must have got in early.

721
01:00:36,920 --> 01:00:38,880
What do you think of our big boy?

722
01:00:39,040 --> 01:00:42,340
You wired us we were to play here,
and they never heard of us.

723
01:00:42,510 --> 01:00:46,720
- I wired you what?
- Go on, show it to him.

724
01:00:47,060 --> 01:00:48,310
Here.

725
01:00:49,560 --> 01:00:52,770
This says "Palmer and Hayden booked
into the Palace New York."

726
01:00:52,980 --> 01:00:55,610
- I know it does.
- Would I say the Palace New York?

727
01:00:55,780 --> 01:00:59,110
Would anybody except a stenographer
who wasn't paying attention?

728
01:00:59,280 --> 01:01:02,120
- What do you mean?
- Well, there's only one Palace.

729
01:01:02,280 --> 01:01:04,450
Nobody has to tell you where that is.

730
01:01:05,210 --> 01:01:06,710
You meant...

731
01:01:08,710 --> 01:01:13,130
- You meant some other Palace?
- Certainly. I said it. The girl got it wrong.

732
01:01:13,300 --> 01:01:17,800
It's the Palace over in Newark.
You open there Wednesday for a split week.

733
01:01:29,320 --> 01:01:31,160
A split week.

734
01:01:32,030 --> 01:01:33,660
In Newark.

735
01:01:37,870 --> 01:01:39,250
It's all right.

736
01:01:39,420 --> 01:01:43,210
Why did you say "congratulations,"
"great opportunity," and build it up?

737
01:01:43,380 --> 01:01:46,220
Because it is a great opportunity.
Newark's so close.

738
01:01:46,380 --> 01:01:49,850
These circuits send scouts.
One might catch your act and like it.

739
01:01:50,010 --> 01:01:52,890
Yeah, yeah, yeah.
It's a great chance.

740
01:01:53,060 --> 01:01:55,020
Don't give me that.

741
01:02:00,610 --> 01:02:02,950
Gee, I'm sorry, kiddo.

742
01:02:07,660 --> 01:02:09,460
Gee.

743
01:02:09,630 --> 01:02:11,090
Gee, Jo.

744
01:02:13,630 --> 01:02:18,390
Maybe you should have stayed with him.
You could be going up in that elevator too.

745
01:02:19,350 --> 01:02:22,350
I'd rather stay
on the ground floor.

746
01:02:25,650 --> 01:02:29,990
Well, they still got us booked
at the little church around the corner.

747
01:02:30,740 --> 01:02:33,030
Still want to?

748
01:02:33,200 --> 01:02:35,620
We gotta open somewhere.

749
01:02:40,460 --> 01:02:42,000
Harry...

750
01:02:43,000 --> 01:02:47,930
I'll marry you now.
I'll marry you anytime you say, but...

751
01:02:48,090 --> 01:02:53,350
...we always agreed that we'd get married
after our first matinee at the Palace.

752
01:02:53,520 --> 01:02:55,980
Let's keep it that way, huh?

753
01:03:02,420 --> 01:03:08,370
<i>Tell me why night's are lonesome.</i>

754
01:03:08,930 --> 01:03:15,630
<i>Tell me why days are blue.</i>

755
01:03:16,000 --> 01:03:24,900
<i>Tell me why all the sunshine
comes just at one time</i>

756
01:03:24,930 --> 01:03:29,400
<i>when I'm with you.</i>

757
01:03:29,550 --> 01:03:35,850
<i>Why do I hate to go, dear.</i>

758
01:03:36,630 --> 01:03:42,850
<i>and hate to say goodbye.</i>

759
01:03:42,890 --> 01:03:48,990
<i>now somehow it's always so, dear,</i>

760
01:03:49,030 --> 01:03:52,450
<i>and if you know dear,</i>

761
01:03:52,480 --> 01:03:55,780
- please tell me why.
- And then this girl said to me,

762
01:03:55,820 --> 01:03:57,100
She said, "Where'd you
ride horses this summer?"

763
01:03:57,270 --> 01:04:00,730
I said, "The same place
I did my ice skating last winter."

764
01:04:02,860 --> 01:04:05,530
Well, fellas, here's to...

765
01:04:06,740 --> 01:04:09,740
Well, here's to...

766
01:04:10,290 --> 01:04:12,250
Here's to.

767
01:04:14,380 --> 01:04:16,000
Say, I wonder where Danny is.

768
01:04:16,170 --> 01:04:19,550
I don't know. He was supposed
to be here a long time ago.

769
01:04:20,880 --> 01:04:23,260
Here he is now!
Hiya, Danny.

770
01:04:24,180 --> 01:04:25,810
You know everybody, don't you?

771
01:04:25,980 --> 01:04:29,400
- What kept you so long?
- Why, we got our sailing orders.

772
01:04:29,560 --> 01:04:32,360
- When do you have to go?
- Right away.

773
01:04:34,240 --> 01:04:39,240
- Right away?
- Yeah, I just got time to say goodbye.

774
01:04:40,080 --> 01:04:42,750
Well, I guess I'm holding up the Army.

775
01:04:43,920 --> 01:04:45,040
So long, Danny.

776
01:04:45,210 --> 01:04:47,250
- Good luck to you, kid.
- Thanks.

777
01:04:47,420 --> 01:04:49,800
- Bye, corporal.
- Bye, Sid. Goodbye.

778
01:04:57,770 --> 01:05:00,650
- Take care of yourself, soldier.
- Yeah.

779
01:05:01,270 --> 01:05:04,780
I sure wish I could postpone
the war long enough...

780
01:05:04,940 --> 01:05:07,070
...to hear you sing again.

781
01:05:07,820 --> 01:05:09,200
Well...

782
01:05:09,370 --> 01:05:12,120
- So long, everybody.
- So long, Danny.

783
01:05:14,470 --> 01:05:21,630
<i>Smile the while you kiss me sad adieu.</i>

784
01:05:21,920 --> 01:05:29,460
<i>When the clouds roll by
I'll come to you.</i>

785
01:05:29,810 --> 01:05:37,150
<i>Then the skies will seem more blue</i>

786
01:05:37,180 --> 01:05:44,450
<i>down in lovers lane, my dearie.</i>

787
01:05:44,490 --> 01:05:51,730
<i>Wedding bells will ring so merrily.</i>

788
01:05:51,760 --> 01:05:58,930
<i>Every tear will be a memory.</i>

789
01:05:58,970 --> 01:06:10,750
- So wait and pray each night for me.
- See you at the Palace, kid.
-It's a date...doctor.

790
01:06:11,350 --> 01:06:18,020
<i>Till we meet</i>

791
01:06:18,060 --> 01:06:24,700
<i>Again</i>

792
01:06:35,410 --> 01:06:40,000
<i>We don't want the bacon.
We don't want the bacon.</i>

793
01:06:40,030 --> 01:06:43,220
<i>What we want is a piece of the Rhine.</i>

794
01:06:43,260 --> 01:06:46,860
<i>We'll crown "Bill the Kaiser"
with a bottle of Budweiser.</i>

795
01:06:47,080 --> 01:06:50,170
<i>We'll have a wonderful time.</i>

796
01:06:50,210 --> 01:06:53,950
<i>Old Wilhelm Der Gross 
will shout Vas is Los?</i>

797
01:06:53,980 --> 01:06:57,570
<i>When we hit that Hindenburg line.
Fine!</i>

798
01:06:57,610 --> 01:07:02,040
<i>The Army and Navy forever.
Three cheers for the red, white and blue.</i>

799
01:07:02,070 --> 01:07:06,800
- Boy, is he hokey.
- But they like it.
- We don't want the bacon.

800
01:07:06,840 --> 01:07:11,540
<i>We don't want the bacon.
What we want is a piece of the Rhine.</i>

801
01:07:19,330 --> 01:07:21,290
They're yours.
What's left of them.

802
01:07:21,460 --> 01:07:24,340
- Come on, let's show them.
- You bet we'll show them.

803
01:07:32,360 --> 01:07:35,440
<i>From coast to coast, 
from Canada to Mexico,</i>

804
01:07:35,480 --> 01:07:38,200
<i>they're doing a new dance 
the tried and true.</i>

805
01:07:38,230 --> 01:07:41,240
<i>Yes, it will sweep the land, 
and you'll think it's so grand.</i>

806
01:07:41,270 --> 01:07:44,610
<i>You'll have to learn how to do it, 
so please don't poo poo it.</i>

807
01:07:44,640 --> 01:07:47,950
<i>'Cause we got this little dance, 
it's gonna rise to fame.</i>

808
01:07:47,980 --> 01:07:51,310
<i>It's sure to put most 
any other dance to shame.</i>

809
01:07:51,340 --> 01:07:54,630
<i>The Turkey Trot, the 
Bunny Hug, the Tickly Toe,</i>

810
01:07:54,670 --> 01:07:58,140
<i>will be forgotten when 
we start to go. </i>

811
01:07:58,240 --> 01:08:01,970
<i>Mr. Leader, won't you start the syncopation,</i>

812
01:08:02,220 --> 01:08:06,090
<i>and we'll begin our little demonstration.</i>

813
01:08:06,130 --> 01:08:09,825
<i>Now, first, you put your 
two knees close up tight,</i>

814
01:08:09,860 --> 01:08:12,730
<i>then you sway 'em to the left, 
and you sway 'em to the right.</i>

815
01:08:12,765 --> 01:08:15,510
<i>Step around the floor kinda nice and light</i>

816
01:08:15,540 --> 01:08:18,380
<i>then you twist around 
and twist around with all of your might.</i>

817
01:08:18,415 --> 01:08:21,162
<i>Stretch your lovin' arms 
straight out in space,</i>

818
01:08:21,197 --> 01:08:23,933
<i>then you do the Eagle Rock 
with style and grace.</i>

819
01:08:23,968 --> 01:08:26,670
<i>Swing your foot way 
'round and bring it back,</i>

820
01:08:26,705 --> 01:08:29,650
<i>now that's what I call Ballin' the Jack</i>

821
01:08:56,240 --> 01:08:57,390
<i>Ballin' the Jack</i>

822
01:09:45,540 --> 01:09:49,130
[cheering and applause]

823
01:10:03,390 --> 01:10:05,430
- Guys, I'm tired...
- Hey, you were great!

824
01:10:05,600 --> 01:10:08,770
Yeah, in Newark. Where are the scouts
you said were coming?

825
01:10:08,940 --> 01:10:11,900
- Well, here's one.
- Hey, were you out front?

826
01:10:12,070 --> 01:10:14,240
You wanted the Palace.
Now you've got it.

827
01:10:14,400 --> 01:10:17,240
The Palace, New York.
Keep it straight this time.

828
01:10:17,410 --> 01:10:20,330
- Hey, you mean it?
- Your audience out there meant it.

829
01:10:20,490 --> 01:10:21,750
Oh, boy!

830
01:10:21,910 --> 01:10:24,250
If they cheer in Newark,
you can phone it in.

831
01:10:24,420 --> 01:10:26,790
- Second week in October?
- Over a month away!

832
01:10:26,960 --> 01:10:29,010
- I won't be able to sleep!
- All right?

833
01:10:29,170 --> 01:10:31,800
- You bet it is!
- Bert, about the kids' salary...

834
01:10:31,970 --> 01:10:34,930
I never discuss details
in front of the artists.

835
01:10:35,100 --> 01:10:37,560
- Goodbye.
- Goodbye. And thanks.

836
01:10:38,270 --> 01:10:41,900
- It's here, honey. This time it's the McCoy.
- Yes, darling!

837
01:10:43,860 --> 01:10:45,490
Say...

838
01:10:45,650 --> 01:10:48,240
Wasn't there some kind of talk
about a wedding?

839
01:10:48,450 --> 01:10:51,660
Stupid, why do you think I've been
anxious to make the Palace?

840
01:10:51,830 --> 01:10:54,580
- Get dressed. We gotta celebrate.
- All right.

841
01:10:55,120 --> 01:10:57,250
You can celebrate in Newark,
can't you?

842
01:10:57,460 --> 01:11:00,260
I could lead a parade
in a telephone booth.

843
01:11:00,420 --> 01:11:02,430
A month is a chance
to polish the act.

844
01:11:02,630 --> 01:11:04,430
- Right.
- We can dig up a new song.

845
01:11:04,600 --> 01:11:07,180
Yeah. What kind of a song, Harry?

846
01:11:07,890 --> 01:11:10,020
Harry, what kind of a song?

847
01:11:10,900 --> 01:11:12,570
Honey, what kind of...?

848
01:11:15,610 --> 01:11:17,610
What's the matter?

849
01:11:27,710 --> 01:11:29,960
You've been drafted.

850
01:11:30,170 --> 01:11:32,090
Not yet, I'm not.

851
01:11:33,180 --> 01:11:36,390
- Well, Harry, it says...
- I don't care what it says there!

852
01:11:37,850 --> 01:11:41,150
Think anything's gonna stand in the way
of playing the Palace?

853
01:11:41,310 --> 01:11:43,940
Oh, no. Not even a war!

854
01:11:50,530 --> 01:11:53,120
I know how you feel.

855
01:11:53,290 --> 01:11:55,540
After all the plans we'd had.

856
01:11:58,710 --> 01:12:01,970
- What can you do?
- Plenty.

857
01:12:03,220 --> 01:12:05,220
I can do plenty!

858
01:12:05,390 --> 01:12:06,720
I'll beat this.

859
01:12:26,960 --> 01:12:29,790
There must be somebody else
you can try.

860
01:12:29,960 --> 01:12:32,090
Look, do you want
us both in jail?

861
01:12:32,260 --> 01:12:35,680
I got two postponements.
Nothing I can do about the one tomorrow.

862
01:12:35,840 --> 01:12:38,060
You have to take
your physical examination.

863
01:12:38,260 --> 01:12:42,230
- But we open Monday.
- Now, look, I've done all I can do.

864
01:12:42,390 --> 01:12:44,900
I got you the Palace.
I ain't booking the war!

865
01:12:45,110 --> 01:12:46,150
Goodbye!

866
01:12:54,870 --> 01:12:57,580
- Well?
- Nothing.

867
01:12:57,750 --> 01:13:00,250
He says he can't do
anything about it.

868
01:13:10,720 --> 01:13:13,020
I guess I'll write a letter to Danny.

869
01:13:13,190 --> 01:13:15,940
Oh, yeah. Go ahead.
I'll see you later.

870
01:13:16,110 --> 01:13:17,480
All right.

871
01:14:02,790 --> 01:14:04,710
Harry, could I use your pen?

872
01:14:04,880 --> 01:14:06,880
- What's the matter?
- Nothing.

873
01:14:07,050 --> 01:14:08,680
- Nothing.
- There is something.

874
01:14:08,890 --> 01:14:11,720
Well, what if there is?
Nagging me won't help!

875
01:14:11,890 --> 01:14:15,230
Kid, I wanna be alone.
Why don't you go back to your room?

876
01:14:15,390 --> 01:14:17,610
I gotta think by myself.

877
01:14:18,610 --> 01:14:22,820
- All right.
- Jo. Look, baby, I didn't mean it.

878
01:14:22,990 --> 01:14:25,620
I've got the jitters, that's all.
I'm sorry.

879
01:14:25,780 --> 01:14:28,040
It's all right. I understand.

880
01:15:24,820 --> 01:15:27,030
- Just take a chair, please.
- Yes, ma'am.

881
01:15:29,330 --> 01:15:31,000
Temporary physical disability.

882
01:15:31,160 --> 01:15:33,960
He's to return in six weeks
for final classification.

883
01:15:34,130 --> 01:15:35,670
Very well, doctor.

884
01:15:41,640 --> 01:15:42,970
Next.

885
01:15:44,970 --> 01:15:48,060
Come on, Jo! Say something.
Tell me, how do I look?

886
01:15:48,230 --> 01:15:51,320
Very brave, Mr. Metcalfe.
Very brave.

887
01:15:52,820 --> 01:15:54,700
- Finish this for me.
- Who's ahead?

888
01:15:54,860 --> 01:15:57,410
If I don't start cheating,
I'll never get even.

889
01:15:57,570 --> 01:15:59,370
- Telegram, Ms. Hayden.
- Thank you.

890
01:16:00,240 --> 01:16:04,330
You don't have to cheat if you see
the moves. You missed one right here.

891
01:16:19,980 --> 01:16:21,230
Hey, Jo, what is it?

892
01:16:24,070 --> 01:16:25,700
What's wrong?

893
01:16:26,700 --> 01:16:27,990
It's...

894
01:16:29,450 --> 01:16:32,910
- It's Danny.
- Danny?

895
01:16:35,170 --> 01:16:37,380
Oh, Jo.

896
01:16:38,300 --> 01:16:40,380
My brother.

897
01:16:41,180 --> 01:16:45,140
Relax, baby, the Palace is okay!
We're gonna kill them.

898
01:16:45,310 --> 01:16:47,100
What's the matter, Jimmy?

899
01:16:47,270 --> 01:16:48,560
Danny.

900
01:16:48,730 --> 01:16:50,810
- Oh, not Danny.
- He's gone.

901
01:16:50,980 --> 01:16:52,860
There, there, now.

902
01:16:55,440 --> 01:16:58,240
Oh, darling, if I could
only make it easier for you.

903
01:16:58,410 --> 01:17:01,240
You don't rate a rotten break like this.

904
01:17:05,710 --> 01:17:08,750
He could have been
such a great doctor.

905
01:17:09,710 --> 01:17:11,220
Great doctor.

906
01:17:12,590 --> 01:17:15,260
But Danny wouldn't
want you to cry.

907
01:17:15,430 --> 01:17:19,520
If he could speak to you now,
he'd tell you he was happy.

908
01:17:19,810 --> 01:17:22,860
Remember, Jo,
Danny did what he wanted to do.

909
01:17:27,820 --> 01:17:29,870
Harry.

910
01:17:30,030 --> 01:17:31,490
What happened to your hand?

911
01:17:31,790 --> 01:17:34,500
It's nothing. An accident.
I caught it in my trunk.

912
01:17:34,660 --> 01:17:38,040
Don't worry, baby.
It won't keep us from playing the Palace.

913
01:17:44,760 --> 01:17:46,430
It was an accident.

914
01:17:50,180 --> 01:17:52,730
Jo, don't you believe me?

915
01:17:53,980 --> 01:17:57,690
All right then, I did do it!
But I only did it for us.

916
01:17:58,860 --> 01:18:00,820
Well, you believe that, don't you?

917
01:18:04,000 --> 01:18:07,540
Oh, I feel sorry for you.

918
01:18:08,670 --> 01:18:11,670
Terribly, desperately sorry.

919
01:18:11,880 --> 01:18:13,840
Jo, if you'd only listen to me.

920
01:18:14,050 --> 01:18:16,430
You're always acting.

921
01:18:17,850 --> 01:18:21,350
But you'll never make
the big time.

922
01:18:21,940 --> 01:18:25,070
Because you're small-time
in your heart.

923
01:18:30,070 --> 01:18:33,030
There's only one thing
you can do for me.

924
01:18:35,240 --> 01:18:37,580
Leave me alone.

925
01:18:39,960 --> 01:18:44,090
I never want to see you again,
as long as I live.

926
01:18:47,600 --> 01:18:49,390
Never.

927
01:19:22,930 --> 01:19:24,810
But it's just stiff, that's all.

928
01:19:24,980 --> 01:19:26,400
No.

929
01:19:26,560 --> 01:19:28,980
It's crippled permanently.

930
01:19:29,150 --> 01:19:31,650
You mean they won't take me?

931
01:19:31,950 --> 01:19:33,280
Couldn't I enlist?

932
01:19:33,490 --> 01:19:36,330
No, the Army won't take you.
The tendons are severed.

933
01:19:36,750 --> 01:19:39,460
- It won't bother you much...
- They've gotta take me.

934
01:19:39,660 --> 01:19:41,630
- You can do something.
- I'm afraid not.

935
01:19:41,840 --> 01:19:43,670
Then send me to some specialist.

936
01:19:43,840 --> 01:19:46,510
Doc, I gotta get it fixed.
I gotta get in the Army!

937
01:19:46,670 --> 01:19:49,510
I'm sorry. There's nothing
anybody can do to help you.

938
01:19:49,680 --> 01:19:51,310
Next.

939
01:19:55,270 --> 01:19:56,940
Sit down.

940
01:20:59,980 --> 01:21:03,450
- Hello, Harry. How are you?
- Eddie, where's Jo?

941
01:21:03,990 --> 01:21:07,200
You have to tell me. Where is she?
I have to see her.

942
01:21:08,120 --> 01:21:12,460
I'm going out of my mind. People cross
the street like I'm a house on fire.

943
01:21:12,620 --> 01:21:15,920
Do something. Call someone.
Say I didn't know what I was doing.

944
01:21:16,090 --> 01:21:18,380
Tell them I don't care
about the Palace.

945
01:21:18,550 --> 01:21:21,470
Tell them I hope
it burns to the ground.

946
01:21:22,260 --> 01:21:25,640
Eddie, listen, you're my friend.
You can't shut me out.

947
01:21:26,230 --> 01:21:29,230
All right, I made a mistake.
I did the wrong thing.

948
01:21:29,400 --> 01:21:31,860
All right, I did the worst thing
in the world.

949
01:21:32,030 --> 01:21:33,900
But I know I did it.

950
01:21:34,490 --> 01:21:38,490
Eddie, somebody's gotta believe me.
I wasn't trying to duck the draft.

951
01:21:39,660 --> 01:21:42,790
I wanted a postponement
so Jo and I could play the Palace...

952
01:21:42,960 --> 01:21:46,130
...and get married after the first matinee,
like we planned.

953
01:21:46,290 --> 01:21:47,960
That's all I wanted.

954
01:21:48,550 --> 01:21:52,800
Eddie, look at my hand!
You don't think I wanted that, do you?

955
01:21:59,440 --> 01:22:03,570
They can't shut me out.
I owe those guys that are fighting.

956
01:22:06,400 --> 01:22:07,870
Eddie.

957
01:22:08,030 --> 01:22:09,490
What am I gonna do?

958
01:22:09,660 --> 01:22:12,200
I don't know, kid. It's your package.

959
01:22:12,370 --> 01:22:14,670
You bought it and wrapped it up.

960
01:22:16,040 --> 01:22:18,630
Guess you'll just have
to untie it yourself.

961
01:22:58,770 --> 01:23:01,400
- Who will be the first to buy a bond?
- I will!

962
01:23:01,560 --> 01:23:03,860
- So will we!
- That's it. Step to the table.

963
01:23:04,020 --> 01:23:06,240
Who wants a share of the future
of America?

964
01:23:06,440 --> 01:23:08,240
Come on, folks.

965
01:23:08,410 --> 01:23:12,080
Everybody can help over there.
The nicest part of being an American.

966
01:23:12,240 --> 01:23:15,080
Folks, put your hands in your pockets
and be a hero.

967
01:23:15,250 --> 01:23:17,130
Can I have somebody...?

968
01:23:17,290 --> 01:23:19,500
Hey, Harry. How are you?

969
01:23:19,670 --> 01:23:21,840
Hello, Sid. What are you doing?

970
01:23:22,010 --> 01:23:24,260
Y.M.C.A.
Going to France in two weeks.

971
01:23:24,430 --> 01:23:26,930
- I thought you were drafted.
- I was, but...

972
01:23:27,100 --> 01:23:30,850
Got my physical exam. They said
they'd take me after women and children.

973
01:23:31,020 --> 01:23:32,350
Say, Harry...

974
01:23:33,650 --> 01:23:35,690
Why don't you join up
and come with us?

975
01:23:35,860 --> 01:23:40,360
I'm not going over there to sing
while guys are getting their heads shot off.

976
01:23:40,530 --> 01:23:43,330
- Funny, that's not the way I look at it.
- Well, I do.

977
01:23:43,490 --> 01:23:48,040
You're a good performer. Those fellas
could use a song and dance, and you...

978
01:23:49,710 --> 01:23:52,340
I just thought maybe you
want to go over there.

979
01:23:53,340 --> 01:23:55,140
See you around
the stage door.

980
01:24:21,710 --> 01:24:23,920
Come on, fellas. Everybody out.

981
01:24:24,260 --> 01:24:26,510
Pile out. Pile out there.

982
01:24:28,350 --> 01:24:29,720
Quiet, quiet, quiet.

983
01:24:29,890 --> 01:24:32,390
We don't wanna spend our last day
on leave here.

984
01:24:32,560 --> 01:24:34,650
- I wanna go to one of them...
- Not today.

985
01:24:34,810 --> 01:24:36,940
- I got drinking to do.
- I'll take charge.

986
01:24:37,110 --> 01:24:41,200
Fall in, everybody.
Attention! Right face!

987
01:24:41,360 --> 01:24:42,660
Forward...

988
01:24:43,070 --> 01:24:44,370
What?

989
01:24:45,370 --> 01:24:47,790
C'est la guerre, old boy.

990
01:24:47,960 --> 01:24:49,630
Oh, I see.

991
01:24:50,420 --> 01:24:52,510
- Money.
- Oh, money. That's what you want.

992
01:24:52,550 --> 01:24:56,890
- Johnny, got any of that special money left?
- Yes, sir. I'm loaded.

993
01:24:57,050 --> 01:24:58,390
There you are, my friend.

994
01:25:01,270 --> 01:25:04,100
Ah, that's fine.
There you go.

995
01:25:06,690 --> 01:25:08,940
Wait a minute.
What about my change?

996
01:25:17,910 --> 01:25:19,960
That goes for you too.

997
01:25:20,120 --> 01:25:22,000
All right, everybody. Fall in.

998
01:25:23,130 --> 01:25:25,300
Attention! Right face!

999
01:25:25,470 --> 01:25:27,305
Forward march!

1000
01:25:27,340 --> 01:25:31,040
<i>Mademoiselle from Armantiers,
parlez vous?</i>

1001
01:25:33,810 --> 01:25:37,150
Detail, halt. Left face.
Fall out.

1002
01:25:37,478 --> 01:25:43,564
<i>Now,Reuben, Reuben, I've been thinkin',
said his wifey dear.</i>

1003
01:25:44,018 --> 01:25:50,424
<i>Now that things are peaceful and calm 
the boys will soon be back on the farm.</i>

1004
01:25:50,459 --> 01:25:56,256
<i>Mister Reuben started winkin' 
and slowly rubbed his chin,</i>

1005
01:25:56,485 --> 01:26:02,605
<i>he pulled his chair up close to mother 
and he asked her with a grin,</i>

1006
01:26:02,640 --> 01:26:09,104
<i>"H-h-h-how ya gonna keep 'em 
down on the farm after they've seen Paree?"</i>

1007
01:26:09,139 --> 01:26:15,754
<i>How ya gonna keep 'em away from Broadway?
Jazzin' around and paintin' the town.</i>

1008
01:26:15,789 --> 01:26:21,942
<i>How ya gonna keep 'em away from harm?
That's the mystery.</i>

1009
01:26:21,977 --> 01:26:27,895
<i>They'll never want to see a rake a plow,
and who the heck can parley-vous a cow?</i>

1010
01:26:27,930 --> 01:26:34,325
<i>H-h-h-how ya gonna keep 'em 
down on the farm after they've seen Paree?</i>

1011
01:26:34,360 --> 01:26:40,685
<i>How ya gonna keep 'em 
down on the farm after they've seen Paree?</i>

1012
01:26:40,720 --> 01:26:47,416
<i>How ya gonna keep 'em away from Broadway?
Jazzin' around and paintin' the town.</i>

1013
01:26:47,451 --> 01:26:53,590
<i>How ya gonna keep 'em away from harm?
That's the mystery.</i>

1014
01:26:53,625 --> 01:27:00,346
<i>Imagine Reuben when he meets his pa, 
he'll kiss his cheek and holler,"Oo-la-la!"</i>

1015
01:27:00,381 --> 01:27:04,550
<i>How ya gonna keep 'em 
down on the farm after they've seen,</i>

1016
01:27:04,585 --> 01:27:10,293
<i>after they've seen, 
after they've seen Paree?</i>

1017
01:27:10,294 --> 01:27:11,294
[cheering and applaue]

1018
01:27:28,090 --> 01:27:29,340
Jimmy!

1019
01:27:29,510 --> 01:27:32,390
Come and let me put my arms
around the Palace Theatre!

1020
01:27:32,550 --> 01:27:34,010
How are you, baby?

1021
01:27:34,180 --> 01:27:38,650
- There are a lot of strangers in the world.
- My golly, let me look at you.

1022
01:27:38,810 --> 01:27:40,650
- You look sensational!
- Thank you.

1023
01:27:40,820 --> 01:27:44,280
How about we step out on the town
and show these Frenchmen...

1024
01:27:44,490 --> 01:27:46,070
...what you can do in Paris?

1025
01:27:46,240 --> 01:27:48,660
Okay, but I got a number to do.
Will you wait?

1026
01:27:48,830 --> 01:27:50,790
Sure, I'll wait.
You know something?

1027
01:27:50,990 --> 01:27:53,960
We're a cinch to win this war
now that you're here.

1028
01:27:54,120 --> 01:27:55,500
I'll only be a minute.

1029
01:27:55,670 --> 01:27:58,710
- You sure you don't mind waiting?
- You know me, Jo.

1030
01:27:58,880 --> 01:28:00,970
I'm a good waiter.

1031
01:28:07,060 --> 01:28:08,430
Hey!

1032
01:28:08,600 --> 01:28:09,900
Harry!

1033
01:28:10,060 --> 01:28:12,730
- Jimmy!
- How are you, kid?

1034
01:28:12,900 --> 01:28:16,030
Gee, I didn't expect to see you.

1035
01:28:16,360 --> 01:28:19,620
- How long you been over here?
- I just landed a few hours ago.

1036
01:28:19,780 --> 01:28:21,370
What do you know about that?

1037
01:28:21,540 --> 01:28:24,670
It's good to see you, Harry.
How's it going?

1038
01:28:27,130 --> 01:28:28,460
Not good.

1039
01:28:29,420 --> 01:28:32,300
I thought it'd be better over here, but...

1040
01:28:33,260 --> 01:28:35,310
...it's not.

1041
01:28:35,470 --> 01:28:37,520
It's not better.

1042
01:28:37,720 --> 01:28:39,940
Well, what's the trouble, kid?

1043
01:28:45,740 --> 01:28:49,030
I'm in the right Army,
but I got the wrong suit on.

1044
01:28:57,250 --> 01:29:00,590
You got the right suit,
and the right fella's wearing it.

1045
01:29:00,760 --> 01:29:03,470
- Lf you're gonna...
- I wanna tell you something.

1046
01:29:03,640 --> 01:29:06,220
Know what's the matter?
You walk around with...

1047
01:29:06,430 --> 01:29:10,140
...a picture-book villain in your pocket.
You look at it like a mirror.

1048
01:29:10,310 --> 01:29:12,060
- Look, Jimmy...
- Cigarette?

1049
01:29:16,940 --> 01:29:19,820
Here's something else
you can put in your book, Harry.

1050
01:29:19,990 --> 01:29:23,240
Here, there aren't any heroes

I've seen them.

- Jimmy...
- Light?

They're all just regular guys.

1054
01:29:37,140 --> 01:29:39,930
And they all love someone.

1055
01:29:40,100 --> 01:29:43,150
That's what makes them
do good things or bad things.

1056
01:29:43,310 --> 01:29:46,900
You did something because you thought
it was the right thing to do.

1057
01:29:47,070 --> 01:29:49,490
And you had two good reasons
for doing it:

1058
01:29:49,660 --> 01:29:54,450
You wanted to get someplace that meant
more to you than anything in the world...

1059
01:29:54,660 --> 01:29:57,460
...and because you loved someone
an awful lot.

1060
01:29:58,080 --> 01:30:01,090
And those are two
pretty good reasons, Harry.

Jo, don't talk. Just stand there.

You don't have to skip rope for me.

You were once my girl.

Jo.

1093

You have to tell me...

1094
01:32:16,690 --> 01:32:20,070
...not a million other people,
but you, have to tell me...

...that I'm not a coward...

That's the medal I want to win
in this war.

You're not a coward, Harry.

That I'd never hate you.

1101

Thanks, Jo.

1102
