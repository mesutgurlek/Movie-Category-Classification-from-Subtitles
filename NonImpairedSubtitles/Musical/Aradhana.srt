1
00:00:14,480 --> 00:00:17,200
Aradhana

2
00:02:07,320 --> 00:02:10,280
In the eyes of the law, murder is the greatest
of all crimes!

3
00:02:10,640 --> 00:02:14,120
And when a woman who gives
birth to man takes a life...

4
00:02:14,240 --> 00:02:16,240
...it becomes more heinous.

5
00:02:16,320 --> 00:02:19,120
And so I ask the court
not to be lenient...

6
00:02:19,520 --> 00:02:21,280
...just because
the accused is a woman.

7
00:02:21,520 --> 00:02:24,640
She should be punished severely
to teach other people a lesson...

8
00:02:24,760 --> 00:02:26,760
...and it will also serve
to uphold the law.

9
00:02:30,160 --> 00:02:31,960
Does the accused wish to say
something in her defence?

10
00:02:35,000 --> 00:02:36,480
No.

11
00:02:38,360 --> 00:02:43,000
After considering all evidence,
the court concludes that...

12
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:47,320
...the accused, Vandana has
committed murder with intention.

13
00:02:48,360 --> 00:02:51,480
And so according to section 302
of the Indian Penal Code...

14
00:02:52,200 --> 00:02:54,160
...the accused is sentenced
to life imprisonment.

15
00:08:44,720 --> 00:08:48,000
- Father.
- My dear, you've arrived!

16
00:08:49,560 --> 00:08:51,680
- I hope that you are fine.
- Yes, father.

17
00:08:52,000 --> 00:08:54,160
Let's go. Porter, the luggage!

18
00:08:57,560 --> 00:09:01,360
- You haven't sacked him as yet?
- I have fired him several times.

19
00:09:02,080 --> 00:09:05,520
But I can't help it, as he
keeps coming back in tears.

20
00:09:11,680 --> 00:09:14,360
- Tikaram!
- I'm coming, sir.

21
00:09:14,760 --> 00:09:16,720
Hurry up.

22
00:09:18,760 --> 00:09:20,720
Welcome home.

23
00:09:22,240 --> 00:09:24,320
Please hold this, sir.

24
00:09:25,240 --> 00:09:28,720
- What is this, Tikaram.
- I want your blessings, miss.

25
00:09:28,920 --> 00:09:33,720
Before entering place your hand
on my head and bless me.

26
00:09:34,120 --> 00:09:39,080
I want to be here
till time immemorial.

27
00:09:39,920 --> 00:09:41,720
You've started buttering me
as soon as I have come.

28
00:09:41,880 --> 00:09:44,760
Get up and go and fetch
the bags from the car.

29
00:09:46,360 --> 00:09:48,360
Let's go in, father.

30
00:09:51,040 --> 00:09:53,760
Look at the state of this house.
There's a nest here.

31
00:09:54,120 --> 00:09:56,080
Father, why don't
you tell Tikaram anything?

32
00:09:56,640 --> 00:09:58,600
He is coming here.
Why don't you tell him?

33
00:09:59,800 --> 00:10:02,400
- Whose job is it to clean?
- Mine.

34
00:10:02,960 --> 00:10:05,080
- For how long have you not
cleaned? - I do it everyday.

35
00:10:05,640 --> 00:10:07,440
Why is there so much dust
on this table?

36
00:10:07,560 --> 00:10:09,080
I forgot.

37
00:10:09,320 --> 00:10:11,920
- Quiet! Father, send him away.
- All right.

38
00:10:12,400 --> 00:10:16,440
I want a week off. I'll go
to the village and see mother.

39
00:10:17,320 --> 00:10:20,440
There's no need to return.
Go for a holiday forever.

40
00:10:20,800 --> 00:10:23,800
No, I won't go.
I will never leave.

41
00:10:24,000 --> 00:10:30,120
If I am fired I shall fast
and lie on your doorstep.

42
00:10:30,320 --> 00:10:32,800
I'll die but
I won't leave this house.

43
00:10:32,920 --> 00:10:35,800
All right. Fetch us
some tea before you die.

44
00:10:36,000 --> 00:10:37,960
I'll get it right away, miss.

45
00:10:39,320 --> 00:10:43,640
Tikaram, go and fetch father.

46
00:10:44,320 --> 00:10:48,120
Right now? Does the master
ever return home before 11?

47
00:10:48,480 --> 00:10:52,440
Now he will return. Tell him
that dinner will be served at 9.

48
00:10:52,840 --> 00:10:54,800
All right.

49
00:10:55,000 --> 00:11:00,160
And tell the gardener
to come to work from tomorrow.

50
00:11:01,360 --> 00:11:02,640
All right.

51
00:11:03,000 --> 00:11:05,160
- One more thing.
- Yes, miss.

52
00:11:05,680 --> 00:11:08,160
Tell the washerman to collect
the clothes tomorrow afternoon.

53
00:11:10,040 --> 00:11:12,480
What should I tell the master?

54
00:11:13,200 --> 00:11:16,640
That dinner will be served
at 9 at the clinic?

55
00:11:17,880 --> 00:11:20,840
Fool! Not at the clinic
but at the dining table.

56
00:11:22,040 --> 00:11:23,520
I have understood.

57
00:11:26,720 --> 00:11:30,160
The washerman in the morning and
the gardener in the evening?

58
00:11:30,880 --> 00:11:32,240
Nonsense!

59
00:11:32,360 --> 00:11:34,000
The gardener in the morning and
the washerman in the evening.

60
00:11:34,360 --> 00:11:35,840
If you return, I'll...

61
00:11:38,040 --> 00:11:40,000
- Fool.
- Miss...

62
00:11:49,400 --> 00:11:53,520
I don't have a camera or else
I'd have got a lovely picture.

63
00:11:54,080 --> 00:11:56,040
Well, I...

64
00:11:56,760 --> 00:12:00,880
The water didn't hurt much
but if you throw the bucket...

65
00:12:03,600 --> 00:12:06,040
Please forgive me.
I made a mistake.

66
00:12:06,920 --> 00:12:10,560
- I mistook you for my servant.
- What!

67
00:12:10,920 --> 00:12:14,200
I mean... I was
very angry with my servant.

68
00:12:14,760 --> 00:12:17,880
And you threw the water on me,
that too in this cold weather.

69
00:12:18,920 --> 00:12:19,880
Please come in.

70
00:12:21,440 --> 00:12:25,240
Have you cooled down?
Please don't embarrass me.

71
00:12:27,120 --> 00:12:29,560
Give me your clothes
and I'll dry them.

72
00:12:35,960 --> 00:12:37,920
- Give me your shirt too.
- What!

73
00:12:38,280 --> 00:12:39,400
Wait.

74
00:12:54,800 --> 00:12:55,920
I'll iron them.

75
00:12:56,080 --> 00:12:58,440
- Excuse me.
- Yes?

76
00:12:59,480 --> 00:13:00,920
Suppose I get pneumonia?

77
00:13:02,480 --> 00:13:04,920
You will be cured.
This is the home of a doctor.

78
00:13:08,320 --> 00:13:10,600
- And you are...
- I am his daughter.

79
00:13:11,640 --> 00:13:13,280
Can I have a cup of
steaming hot tea?

80
00:13:13,800 --> 00:13:15,800
Tea! Sure!

81
00:13:28,840 --> 00:13:32,800
- Hello! Are you the doctor?
- Yes. And who are you?

82
00:13:33,000 --> 00:13:34,960
I am a pilot in the Air Force.

83
00:13:35,120 --> 00:13:37,480
Is this the uniform of a pilot?

84
00:13:39,160 --> 00:13:43,320
Actually...
Your daughter took my clothes.

85
00:13:43,840 --> 00:13:45,800
- My daughter?
- Yes.

86
00:13:49,840 --> 00:13:51,320
My daughter is quite
capable of doing this.

87
00:13:55,200 --> 00:13:57,160
You've come, father!
There's someone here to see you.

88
00:13:57,280 --> 00:14:01,640
Yes. There's a pilot
exercising in my towel.

89
00:14:02,040 --> 00:14:03,520
Exercises? What do you mean?

90
00:14:03,680 --> 00:14:06,680
What do you mean?! Why didn't
you tell me about him before?

91
00:14:08,200 --> 00:14:11,160
What is his name? Was he
studying with you in college?

92
00:14:11,360 --> 00:14:13,360
Who? I don't even know him.

93
00:14:14,720 --> 00:14:17,000
This shirt?
Why are you laughing?

94
00:14:17,200 --> 00:14:20,160
I had thrown water
on him by mistake.

95
00:14:20,640 --> 00:14:23,000
So I thought that I would
dry his clothes and iron them.

96
00:14:23,200 --> 00:14:26,360
- That's all? - I'll also
give him a cup of tea.

97
00:14:26,720 --> 00:14:30,160
I thought that
you knew each other.

98
00:14:30,880 --> 00:14:34,360
I thought that you liked him
so my problem would be solved.

99
00:14:35,240 --> 00:14:37,200
What are you saying?

100
00:14:42,560 --> 00:14:44,040
Your tea.

101
00:14:44,160 --> 00:14:47,680
- Thank you. I bothered you
unnecessarily. - Not at all.

102
00:14:47,800 --> 00:14:51,040
You had to make tea
and iron my clothes.

103
00:14:51,760 --> 00:14:55,040
Please tell the doctor
to accompany me.

104
00:14:55,160 --> 00:14:58,040
No. Father is tired.
He will not go anywhere now.

105
00:14:58,600 --> 00:15:00,720
What! We could get into trouble.

106
00:15:01,080 --> 00:15:04,720
My friend and I left on
a holiday without permission.

107
00:15:04,920 --> 00:15:06,560
And my friend
has fallen ill suddenly.

108
00:15:06,640 --> 00:15:08,640
If he doesn't recover before
we reach the headquarters...

109
00:15:08,720 --> 00:15:10,680
...we'll get into trouble.
- What can I do?

110
00:15:12,120 --> 00:15:15,560
- Doctor, I'd be obliged if...
- I heard it. Let's go.

111
00:15:16,120 --> 00:15:18,400
- Okay. Let's go.
- At least drink your tea.

112
00:15:22,600 --> 00:15:26,240
Thank you for the tea
and also for drying my clothes.

113
00:15:27,440 --> 00:15:29,400
Let's go.

114
00:15:39,640 --> 00:15:41,600
Sir, I've brought you your tea.

115
00:15:41,800 --> 00:15:43,080
- Make it.
- Yes, sir.

116
00:15:43,320 --> 00:15:45,760
- Has the other man got up?
- He has already gone out.

117
00:15:47,480 --> 00:15:49,120
He has gone out?! Where?

118
00:15:49,240 --> 00:15:52,120
He has gone to visit the doctor,
and asked you to meet him there.

119
00:15:52,800 --> 00:15:54,800
- And his belongings?
- They are here.

120
00:15:55,400 --> 00:15:57,800
He asked me to pack them and
said that you'd take them along.

121
00:15:58,160 --> 00:16:00,440
- And also give me a tip.
- Scoundrel!

122
00:16:00,560 --> 00:16:02,280
- What!
- Nothing.

123
00:16:02,400 --> 00:16:03,880
- Is my jeep there?
- Yes it is outside.

124
00:16:04,000 --> 00:16:05,960
Keep my things in the car.

125
00:16:09,640 --> 00:16:12,120
- You don't have a fever anymore.
- How could I, Ms Vandana?

126
00:16:12,840 --> 00:16:15,800
My fever abated on taking your
father's medicines yesterday.

127
00:16:16,160 --> 00:16:19,120
And now it has gone completely
after drinking the tea you made.

128
00:16:19,360 --> 00:16:21,440
- Who told you my name?
- Arun.

129
00:16:22,000 --> 00:16:25,800
- Is your friend's name Arun?
- Yes. Didn't he tell you?

130
00:16:26,840 --> 00:16:29,480
- He's an ass!
- You've come?!

131
00:16:30,360 --> 00:16:33,160
My name is Madan Varma.
We are Flight Lieutenants.

132
00:16:33,520 --> 00:16:35,160
He's a year junior to me.

133
00:16:35,280 --> 00:16:38,160
So that is why he is standing.
...Please have a seat.

134
00:16:38,800 --> 00:16:40,760
No, thank you.
We are in a hurry.

135
00:16:41,200 --> 00:16:43,160
You must be feeling
perfectly all right now.

136
00:16:45,040 --> 00:16:48,160
- Have a cup of tea.
- Yes. There's no need to hurry.

137
00:16:48,680 --> 00:16:50,160
You won't get
such lovely tea anywhere else.

138
00:16:50,360 --> 00:16:52,320
So you want a another cup.

139
00:16:52,480 --> 00:16:54,640
If you don't consider him
too shameless.

140
00:16:55,040 --> 00:16:56,840
I'll get it.

141
00:17:01,200 --> 00:17:03,360
Madan, why have
you come here so early?

142
00:17:03,720 --> 00:17:05,680
You are useless
where girls are concerned.

143
00:17:06,200 --> 00:17:09,160
I realised the serious condition
when I saw you last night.

144
00:17:09,560 --> 00:17:12,680
- So I came to see the girl.
- And now that you've seen her?

145
00:17:12,880 --> 00:17:16,520
Should I be honest? She's
worthy of being a sister-in-law.

146
00:17:16,720 --> 00:17:18,680
- Whose?
- Mine, of course.

147
00:17:20,080 --> 00:17:22,880
- Marry her immediately.
- But I don't even know her.

148
00:17:23,400 --> 00:17:25,360
I'll help you out.

149
00:17:31,240 --> 00:17:33,200
What about you?

150
00:17:33,600 --> 00:17:37,200
I just drink two cups a day.
Anything in excess is harmful.

151
00:17:37,400 --> 00:17:40,200
Did you hear that?
And you drink 40 cups everyday.

152
00:17:40,400 --> 00:17:41,880
40 cups daily?

153
00:17:42,080 --> 00:17:45,360
Yes. 40 cups of tea
and 150 cigarettes daily.

154
00:17:46,920 --> 00:17:50,200
If you tell him anything
do you know what he says?

155
00:17:51,240 --> 00:17:55,200
He says "Even if I die young,
there's no one to mourn my loss"

156
00:17:56,440 --> 00:17:58,400
Don't you have anyone?

157
00:17:59,600 --> 00:18:01,080
Well...

158
00:18:01,760 --> 00:18:05,240
He would listen only if he had
someone to call his own.

159
00:18:05,440 --> 00:18:08,400
Someone who would reform him.
Let's go.

160
00:18:08,880 --> 00:18:11,240
- At least drink your tea.
- No. I'll heed your advice.

161
00:18:12,280 --> 00:18:14,920
Let's go.
Goodbye.

162
00:18:17,640 --> 00:18:20,760
Mr. Arun, heed
your friend's advice.

163
00:18:21,120 --> 00:18:23,600
Too much tea and cigarettes
is not good. Goodbye.

164
00:18:27,800 --> 00:18:29,240
Who asked you to
talk such nonsense?

165
00:18:29,400 --> 00:18:31,360
It wasn't nonsense.
I was making the runway for you.

166
00:18:31,800 --> 00:18:34,120
So that you can make a perfect
landing into her heart.

167
00:18:34,880 --> 00:18:36,880
Give me your cigarette case.

168
00:18:38,800 --> 00:18:40,800
You will need an excuse
to come here again.

169
00:18:41,320 --> 00:18:44,000
Come here looking
for your cigarette case.

170
00:18:45,320 --> 00:18:47,280
Hey! Where did this come from?

171
00:18:50,600 --> 00:18:52,560
Sir!

172
00:18:53,640 --> 00:18:55,960
Sir, your cigarette case!

173
00:19:00,320 --> 00:19:02,120
Oh! He has gone.

174
00:19:08,360 --> 00:19:10,320
Sir, your cigarette case!

175
00:19:27,880 --> 00:19:29,800
Sir, your cigarette case!

176
00:19:31,680 --> 00:19:33,640
Here's your runway.

177
00:19:35,040 --> 00:19:37,640
- Who is this weirdo?
- He is their servant, Tikaram.

178
00:19:38,680 --> 00:19:41,320
- Hello, Tikaram!
- Hello, sir!

179
00:19:41,480 --> 00:19:45,000
You're a magician. You reached
here before our jeep.

180
00:19:45,360 --> 00:19:49,520
Sir, you came along
winding road.

181
00:19:50,040 --> 00:19:52,840
And I came straight
along the shortcut.

182
00:19:54,560 --> 00:19:56,360
- Get into the car.
- Me?

183
00:19:56,480 --> 00:19:59,000
You have returned
our cigarette case.

184
00:19:59,400 --> 00:20:01,360
We won't let you go without
treating you to tea first.

185
00:20:02,000 --> 00:20:03,000
Is there any hotel close by?

186
00:20:03,240 --> 00:20:05,360
The Lord's temple is there
half a mile down this road.

187
00:20:05,560 --> 00:20:09,680
- The Lord's temple?
- Yes. A goddess makes the tea.

188
00:20:10,000 --> 00:20:13,880
I go there every Tuesday to
drink tea in order to see her.

189
00:20:14,080 --> 00:20:15,760
Tuesday! Today is Tuesday.

190
00:20:15,880 --> 00:20:17,880
- You can visit her today.
- All right.

191
00:20:18,240 --> 00:20:20,040
Hop in.
...What's going on?

192
00:20:20,240 --> 00:20:22,880
To walk into a house you have to
win over the servant first.

193
00:20:25,400 --> 00:20:27,360
- One for me, too.
- Sure.

194
00:20:35,920 --> 00:20:37,880
Stop!

195
00:20:38,040 --> 00:20:41,400
Bhagwan (Lord), please
send us three cups of tea.

196
00:20:42,040 --> 00:20:43,400
All right.

197
00:20:44,600 --> 00:20:49,400
Now Champa will come along
with the tea.

198
00:20:51,920 --> 00:20:53,400
Sir, your tea.

199
00:20:53,560 --> 00:20:56,920
Why did you take the trouble
to bring the tea?

200
00:20:57,280 --> 00:21:00,080
I can't help it. Champa has
gone to graze the cows.

201
00:21:00,280 --> 00:21:03,760
- Where?
- In the forest near the field.

202
00:21:04,040 --> 00:21:07,080
It's all right.
These are officers. Salute them.

203
00:21:07,440 --> 00:21:09,240
Salutations, sirs!

204
00:21:09,400 --> 00:21:10,760
- Me, too.
- Why?

205
00:21:10,960 --> 00:21:15,240
I have brought
these officers to your shop...

206
00:21:15,440 --> 00:21:17,440
...and added grandeur to it.

207
00:21:17,560 --> 00:21:21,760
Sir, I admit that
my tea stall is small...

208
00:21:22,160 --> 00:21:25,120
...but you won't find
better tea anywhere else.

209
00:21:25,320 --> 00:21:27,280
- The tea is excellent.
- Thank you, sir.

210
00:21:27,480 --> 00:21:29,440
- Can I have some tea?
- Sure.

211
00:21:31,000 --> 00:21:32,960
He didn't salute me.

212
00:21:33,480 --> 00:21:36,120
His name is Bhagwan (Lord),
but he is the devil.

213
00:21:37,160 --> 00:21:41,800
He says he will marry Champa
to anyone who gives him Rs 1000.

214
00:21:42,640 --> 00:21:45,800
It seems as though
my wish will never be fulfilled.

215
00:21:46,000 --> 00:21:49,440
You will get your wish. We will
see that you get married.

216
00:21:49,600 --> 00:21:51,440
- Really?
- Absolutely.

217
00:21:51,600 --> 00:21:54,800
But we will help you
only if you help us.

218
00:21:55,120 --> 00:21:57,480
Tell me what I have to do.
I'll do everything.

219
00:21:57,680 --> 00:21:59,480
- Come with us.
- Take this.

220
00:21:59,680 --> 00:22:03,480
Bhagwan, here are your glasses
and your money.

221
00:22:09,160 --> 00:22:13,000
Just tell us where your
mistress goes and at what time.

222
00:22:13,360 --> 00:22:15,240
I mean, her likes and dislikes.

223
00:22:15,360 --> 00:22:17,320
I understand, sir.

224
00:22:17,680 --> 00:22:22,640
I'll tell you everything but
you must proceed with great care.

225
00:22:23,200 --> 00:22:25,680
Or else you might
get into trouble.

226
00:22:26,040 --> 00:22:29,160
- Why?
- She is very hot tempered.

227
00:22:30,160 --> 00:22:33,520
A hot tempered girl
adds spice to love.

228
00:22:34,360 --> 00:22:36,360
Miss, here are the apples.

229
00:22:37,720 --> 00:22:40,160
- How much do they cost?
- Shall we buy some?

230
00:22:40,560 --> 00:22:43,520
- How much for these oranges?
- They must be sour... You!

231
00:22:44,400 --> 00:22:46,000
You! Hello!

232
00:22:49,080 --> 00:22:51,360
Do you have a holiday
today also?

233
00:22:51,720 --> 00:22:54,360
I don't have a holiday.
I just came to shop.

234
00:22:54,720 --> 00:22:56,880
You don't get anything
near the airport.

235
00:22:57,400 --> 00:22:59,520
I have to come so far
to buy apples.

236
00:22:59,760 --> 00:23:03,880
My father used to say one can't
reap fruit without hard work.

237
00:23:04,240 --> 00:23:05,560
- Absolutely right.
- Let's go, Tikaram.

238
00:23:05,760 --> 00:23:09,040
- What about the apples?
- They are not so good.

239
00:23:09,400 --> 00:23:12,280
I'll take you to another stall
and get you very good apples.

240
00:23:12,400 --> 00:23:14,360
Goodbye. Let's go, Tikaram.

241
00:23:38,200 --> 00:23:41,520
- You, here?
- Hello, doctor!

242
00:23:42,440 --> 00:23:46,880
God bless you! I thought the
military was full of atheists.

243
00:23:47,440 --> 00:23:49,400
Each man has his own beliefs.

244
00:23:49,960 --> 00:23:51,920
One should worship ardently.

245
00:23:52,200 --> 00:23:54,240
Yes, of course. Give him
some offerings, my dear.

246
00:23:54,400 --> 00:23:56,920
Since I have come to the Goddess
I must receive some offerings.

247
00:23:57,400 --> 00:24:01,920
Today, I've received the fruits
of my prayers immediately.

248
00:24:04,800 --> 00:24:06,280
Are you going home?

249
00:24:06,480 --> 00:24:08,600
I have my jeep
and we are going the same way.

250
00:24:08,800 --> 00:24:10,760
All right, let's go.

251
00:24:11,960 --> 00:24:13,280
Do you come here everyday?

252
00:24:13,480 --> 00:24:15,920
I come here whenever I wish
to pay homage to the Goddess.

253
00:24:17,160 --> 00:24:20,120
I'm happy to hear that. Are you
going to drive in these clothes?

254
00:24:20,640 --> 00:24:22,640
No. I'll be back in 5 minutes.

255
00:24:37,680 --> 00:24:38,640
Come.

256
00:24:42,000 --> 00:24:43,960
Please get in.

257
00:24:46,520 --> 00:24:48,480
Get in, my dear.

258
00:25:03,080 --> 00:25:06,640
I forgot to ask you your name
the last time.

259
00:25:08,200 --> 00:25:10,160
Miss Vandana is aware of it.

260
00:25:10,680 --> 00:25:13,680
- You didn't tell me.
- You didn't ask me, father.

261
00:25:15,560 --> 00:25:18,000
- Where are you from?
- Delhi.

262
00:25:18,880 --> 00:25:23,680
Father had a business. After his
death we settled in Mathura.

263
00:25:24,200 --> 00:25:26,680
Oh! Who is there in your house?

264
00:25:27,040 --> 00:25:29,000
My paternal uncle and his wife.

265
00:25:29,720 --> 00:25:31,680
And you have come so far.

266
00:25:32,040 --> 00:25:34,000
My job in the Air Force
requires it.

267
00:25:36,200 --> 00:25:39,000
When we lived in Delhi
I used to go home every Sunday.

268
00:25:39,880 --> 00:25:42,200
After coming here I miss home.

269
00:25:43,000 --> 00:25:47,880
- I've no friends or family here.
- Why do you say that?

270
00:25:47,960 --> 00:25:51,040
Consider our home as your own
and come over on any holiday.

271
00:25:51,360 --> 00:25:53,320
I don't want
to bother you unnecessarily.

272
00:25:53,400 --> 00:25:57,040
It won't be a bother.
You'll just have some tea.

273
00:25:57,400 --> 00:25:59,200
I might be tempted
to stay for lunch.

274
00:25:59,400 --> 00:26:01,880
That is Vandana's department.
Ask her.

275
00:26:02,920 --> 00:26:04,400
Well?

276
00:26:04,480 --> 00:26:07,880
Father, will an Air Force pilot
like our simple food?

277
00:26:08,080 --> 00:26:11,080
At least invite over.

278
00:26:11,440 --> 00:26:13,400
- Whenever you wish to come.
- Come over next Sunday.

279
00:26:20,920 --> 00:26:22,560
You!

280
00:26:22,920 --> 00:26:26,400
I knew that you couldn't wait
until Sunday.

281
00:26:26,800 --> 00:26:28,880
I haven't come over to eat.

282
00:26:29,120 --> 00:26:31,080
Have you come
to meet father, then?

283
00:26:32,280 --> 00:26:34,600
- I have come to have my wound dressed. - Wound?

284
00:26:36,720 --> 00:26:38,680
Do you call
this small scratch a wound?

285
00:26:39,120 --> 00:26:42,600
I had heard that the Air Force
people were very brave.

286
00:26:42,960 --> 00:26:47,240
You'd have also heard a small
injury can become a deep wound.

287
00:26:47,960 --> 00:26:51,240
And an acquaintance
can become a life partner.

288
00:26:53,320 --> 00:26:55,280
Please have a seat
while I fetch the medicines.

289
00:27:01,800 --> 00:27:05,440
Last night I had a dream.
What did you dream of?

290
00:27:05,800 --> 00:27:08,440
There was fire all round
and great clouds of smoke.

291
00:27:09,320 --> 00:27:13,280
The fire of machine guns
and tanks. A deadly war is on.

292
00:27:13,800 --> 00:27:18,120
I ran and boarded my plane.
I took off.

293
00:27:18,480 --> 00:27:23,120
When the speed touched 700
I saw the enemy airfield below.

294
00:27:23,760 --> 00:27:28,440
Three bombs fall on the target
and the airfield is wiped out.

295
00:27:30,000 --> 00:27:33,120
- What happened next?
- There was a loud noise.

296
00:27:33,680 --> 00:27:36,800
My plane was hit. When I look behind
half the plane is missing.

297
00:27:37,440 --> 00:27:38,800
When I look down
I lose my senses.

298
00:27:39,000 --> 00:27:42,320
I take the name of the Lord,
shut my eyes and jump.

299
00:27:43,000 --> 00:27:47,480
I wake up in a strange city
in front of a strange house.

300
00:27:47,880 --> 00:27:51,800
The door opens and a lovely girl
splashes a bucket of water on me.

301
00:27:52,680 --> 00:27:55,160
- And I opened my eyes. - Thank
goodness you opened your eyes!

302
00:27:55,360 --> 00:27:57,840
I was afraid that your dream
wouldn't come to an end.

303
00:27:59,360 --> 00:28:02,160
End! My dream has just started.

304
00:28:03,880 --> 00:28:07,160
I have bandaged your hand.

305
00:28:07,880 --> 00:28:12,360
- Now...
- You bandaged the wrong hand.

306
00:28:13,120 --> 00:28:17,360
- Wrong hand?
- Do you know what happened?

307
00:28:18,040 --> 00:28:21,680
- What?
- You were lost in my dream.

308
00:28:25,240 --> 00:28:26,800
Will my dream come true?

309
00:28:28,560 --> 00:28:30,520
- How should I know?
- Then who knows?

310
00:28:32,080 --> 00:28:33,360
Father.

311
00:28:36,920 --> 00:28:38,880
I was going to speak to father.

312
00:28:39,920 --> 00:28:41,880
Are you listening?

313
00:28:43,080 --> 00:28:45,880
So you approve of me, right?
Which means that you do.

314
00:28:46,760 --> 00:28:49,560
I'll obtain father's permission.
He will never refuse me.

315
00:28:50,080 --> 00:28:52,360
Are you listening?

316
00:28:52,600 --> 00:28:56,400
- Hello, doctor!
- Hello! What is it?

317
00:28:56,920 --> 00:28:58,880
- Promise me that you
won't refuse. - I promise.

318
00:28:59,760 --> 00:29:02,560
There's a function at our mess.

319
00:29:02,920 --> 00:29:04,880
And I want both of you to come.

320
00:29:05,920 --> 00:29:08,080
- You will have to come.
- We'll surely come.

321
00:29:08,440 --> 00:29:10,880
- Shall I come to pick
you up at 5? - All right.

322
00:29:11,920 --> 00:29:13,920
It's fixed.

323
00:29:20,440 --> 00:29:23,080
What are you thinking about?

324
00:29:23,640 --> 00:29:25,240
Nothing.

325
00:29:26,120 --> 00:29:31,400
Don't worry. When he comes
to ask me I'll agree right away.

326
00:29:32,280 --> 00:29:34,240
I also approve of him.

327
00:29:38,960 --> 00:29:39,920
Hello!

328
00:29:40,160 --> 00:29:42,600
Madan, take them inside.
I'll just change and come.

329
00:29:45,960 --> 00:29:47,920
- Come soon.
- I'll be back soon.

330
00:30:09,320 --> 00:30:11,320
Happy birthday, sir.

331
00:30:11,840 --> 00:30:14,640
This is my guest, Ms Vandana
and this is...

332
00:30:26,000 --> 00:30:28,480
Officers should never
give incomplete information.

333
00:30:28,840 --> 00:30:30,160
I don't understand, sir.

334
00:30:30,280 --> 00:30:34,480
I'm sure you understood. Is she
your guest or something more?

335
00:30:34,680 --> 00:30:36,160
Well...

336
00:30:39,040 --> 00:30:41,000
Sir, we love each other.

337
00:30:42,040 --> 00:30:44,640
- Are they engaged?
- Sir, they just met recently.

338
00:30:45,520 --> 00:30:49,160
So what? An Air Force Officer
should always work with speed.

339
00:30:49,680 --> 00:30:51,680
Every second is precious.

340
00:31:03,560 --> 00:31:06,000
Where were you, my dear?
I was looking all over for you.

341
00:31:06,400 --> 00:31:08,360
This is my father.

342
00:31:20,880 --> 00:31:25,040
Because your daughter
should've been in the Air Force.

343
00:31:25,920 --> 00:31:27,880
- Why?
- I'll explain.

344
00:31:28,080 --> 00:31:30,680
Air Force Officers
need to have two qualities.

345
00:31:30,920 --> 00:31:34,880
Sharp vision and good speed,
which your daughter has.

346
00:31:35,600 --> 00:31:37,720
- I still don't understand.
- I'll explain again.

347
00:31:38,080 --> 00:31:43,720
Amongst all these officers, your
daughter chose our best officer.

348
00:31:44,080 --> 00:31:45,720
This indicates sharp vision.

349
00:31:46,080 --> 00:31:49,880
And they fell in love within
two days which indicates speed.

350
00:32:26,960 --> 00:32:31,760
I thank you for coming here
to celebrate my birthday.

351
00:32:32,800 --> 00:32:37,600
To be frank birthday greetings
should be given...

352
00:32:37,800 --> 00:32:40,120
...to those
Air Force Officers...

353
00:32:40,800 --> 00:32:43,120
...in whose lives
every day is a birthday.

354
00:32:43,800 --> 00:32:48,120
Whose lives are in peril
at every moment of everyday.

355
00:32:49,480 --> 00:32:51,800
Those officers
should be congratulated...

356
00:32:52,000 --> 00:32:55,960
...who break the sound barrier
piercing the sky like lightning...

357
00:32:56,320 --> 00:33:00,800
...to go far above the earth
to protect their country.

358
00:33:01,360 --> 00:33:04,120
Be it war time or peace time.

359
00:33:06,440 --> 00:33:12,960
Flight lieutenant Arun would
be able to explain it better.

360
00:33:13,920 --> 00:33:17,000
Because he has recently gone
through a tragic experience.

361
00:33:17,440 --> 00:33:21,640
And that tragedy is Ms Vandana.

362
00:33:47,560 --> 00:33:50,000
- What happened?
- Nothing.

363
00:33:51,400 --> 00:33:55,520
- Why are your eyes shut?
- I'm dreaming of you.

364
00:33:55,880 --> 00:33:59,520
- Why is your heart racing?
- It is calling out to you.

365
00:34:00,720 --> 00:34:04,880
- Why are you taking quick breaths?
- To come closer to you.

366
00:34:08,240 --> 00:34:10,200
They've brought me so far.

367
00:34:10,560 --> 00:34:12,560
- Really?
- Yes.

368
00:34:16,240 --> 00:34:18,200
I am very happy today.

369
00:34:19,240 --> 00:34:22,720
You are mine and I am yours.

370
00:34:23,400 --> 00:34:29,200
And... You are mine
and I am yours.

371
00:34:34,120 --> 00:34:39,080
When a man looks for a mate...

372
00:34:40,280 --> 00:34:42,880
...he has the image
of a girl...

373
00:34:43,600 --> 00:34:47,880
...in whose eyes he can see
love, sacrifice and dedication.

374
00:34:49,560 --> 00:34:54,760
Suddenly you came
into my life...

375
00:34:56,120 --> 00:34:59,080
...and my dream came true.

376
00:35:02,440 --> 00:35:03,920
Really?

377
00:35:06,640 --> 00:35:08,600
Don't you believe me?

378
00:35:09,800 --> 00:35:13,240
If you don't believe me
ask these ice-capped mountains.

379
00:35:13,640 --> 00:35:15,760
Ask the waves of these rivers
and ask the spring.

380
00:35:16,320 --> 00:35:20,920
Our hearts beat as one...
...will echo in the hills.

381
00:35:22,160 --> 00:35:23,120
Listen...

382
00:40:50,640 --> 00:40:53,120
Nice shot, sir ...

383
00:40:55,640 --> 00:40:57,120
Isn't that right, Madan?

384
00:40:57,200 --> 00:40:59,600
- Arun, have you ever
played billiards? - Well...

385
00:41:00,000 --> 00:41:02,600
Do you know what they call
this shot?

386
00:41:07,000 --> 00:41:10,800
This flattery can only mean that
you want a favour or else...

387
00:41:12,480 --> 00:41:14,440
I need special permission.

388
00:41:15,640 --> 00:41:18,960
My fiancee has never seen
a plane from close quarters.

389
00:41:22,480 --> 00:41:23,800
Then show it to her.

390
00:41:24,000 --> 00:41:26,480
Sir, she would like
to see me flying the plane.

391
00:41:28,840 --> 00:41:30,800
Then fly a plane and show her.

392
00:41:31,160 --> 00:41:35,800
She wants to be beside me
when I fly the plane.

393
00:41:38,360 --> 00:41:42,120
You know that no civilian
can board an Air Force plane.

394
00:41:42,200 --> 00:41:44,200
But Vandana is not a civilian.
She is a girl.

395
00:41:44,520 --> 00:41:46,000
I mean, she is my fiancee.

396
00:41:46,200 --> 00:41:49,000
And you know all about a girl's
resolve; you're experienced.

397
00:41:50,200 --> 00:41:52,160
Absolutely not.

398
00:41:52,360 --> 00:41:54,320
The experience was only once..

399
00:41:54,680 --> 00:41:58,640
and I had to marry the second time.

400
00:42:02,720 --> 00:42:06,000
Sir, suppose you make
a promise to your wife...

401
00:42:06,880 --> 00:42:11,160
...isn't it necessary to
keep it? - You have no choice.

402
00:42:11,560 --> 00:42:13,520
Do you know the meaning
of the word "wife'?

403
00:42:18,080 --> 00:42:20,360
My Army, Navy and Air Force
is Vandana.

404
00:42:22,720 --> 00:42:24,680
I have promised her
a joyride, sir.

405
00:42:25,240 --> 00:42:28,360
And you want me to break the Air
Force rules for your joyride?

406
00:42:33,760 --> 00:42:37,320
I permit you. But you must use
the flying club aircraft.

407
00:42:38,400 --> 00:42:40,360
And...

408
00:42:41,360 --> 00:42:45,200
You are going to get married
and I have 20 years experience.

409
00:42:45,600 --> 00:42:47,360
I have some advice for you.

410
00:42:47,600 --> 00:42:50,560
The first is: Always fulfill
a promise made to your wife.

411
00:42:50,760 --> 00:42:54,720
- And the second? - Don't
promise or you'll regret it.

412
00:43:05,600 --> 00:43:07,560
I have never seen such clouds.

413
00:43:07,920 --> 00:43:11,880
Vinu, we are in the sky
and we are far above the clouds.

414
00:43:12,800 --> 00:43:14,760
Just you and me.

415
00:43:16,640 --> 00:43:20,080
It feels like a dream world.

416
00:43:21,120 --> 00:43:24,240
It is my dream world.
My life in the Air Force...

417
00:43:25,640 --> 00:43:30,440
...where there is no limit
to speed or flight.

418
00:43:31,960 --> 00:43:33,920
The earth is ours
and so is the sky.

419
00:43:34,480 --> 00:43:38,600
The Air Force is a part of me.

420
00:43:39,640 --> 00:43:41,440
And I?

421
00:43:41,640 --> 00:43:45,600
You are in every breath I take.

422
00:43:48,800 --> 00:43:52,440
You have already reached a great
height; your speed is also great.

423
00:43:53,480 --> 00:43:57,280
Do we have to land back on the
ground after reaching the skies?

424
00:44:02,000 --> 00:44:04,960
Dear chief and my
fellow brethren...

425
00:44:05,520 --> 00:44:09,440
...on this holy festival
and with your blessing...

426
00:44:09,840 --> 00:44:13,160
...I wish to announce my
daughter Champa's engagement.

427
00:44:13,520 --> 00:44:17,320
And the man whom I have chosen
to be my son-in-law is...

428
00:44:17,680 --> 00:44:19,480
Myself.

429
00:44:19,840 --> 00:44:22,320
Really? Do you have the ability
to give a thousand rupees?

430
00:44:22,680 --> 00:44:27,320
Rs 1000. I don't even buy
vegetables without bargaining.

431
00:44:27,680 --> 00:44:30,000
And this is a matter
of my whole life.

432
00:44:30,520 --> 00:44:32,320
- Will you take Rs. 200
- 200!

433
00:44:32,680 --> 00:44:35,000
Manglu, you also want to marry
her, right? Name your price?

434
00:44:36,680 --> 00:44:38,440
- Rs. 5... 500.

435
00:44:38,640 --> 00:44:41,000
- Excellent!
- Damn!

436
00:44:41,880 --> 00:44:44,160
- Rs. 1000.
- Sir...

437
00:44:44,720 --> 00:44:47,840
does a big officer like you
wish to marry my daughter?

438
00:44:49,720 --> 00:44:51,840
No. I don't want you
to auction your daughter.

439
00:44:52,360 --> 00:44:54,520
Let her marry Tikaram
whom she loves.

440
00:44:55,360 --> 00:44:59,160
- Do you love this fool?
- Yes, father.

441
00:45:00,880 --> 00:45:02,880
- Oh, fool's father-in-law.
- Yes.

442
00:45:03,080 --> 00:45:07,520
Decide quickly for
if my master leaves in a huff...

443
00:45:07,880 --> 00:45:09,880
...then you will be left
with nothing.

444
00:45:10,240 --> 00:45:13,360
What are you saying?
The alliance is fixed.

445
00:45:13,880 --> 00:45:15,880
Respected chief
and my fellow brethren...

446
00:45:16,240 --> 00:45:20,680
...today I fix my
daughter's wedding with Tikaram.

447
00:45:24,920 --> 00:45:26,560
Garland me quickly.

448
00:45:26,760 --> 00:45:30,560
Now on this joyous occasion
and according to our custom...

449
00:45:31,520 --> 00:45:35,560
...I ask everyone to celebrate
with a drink.

450
00:45:38,440 --> 00:45:40,720
Sir, do the honours.

451
00:45:40,920 --> 00:45:44,240
You fool! How can you give
the gentleman our local stuff?

452
00:45:44,760 --> 00:45:47,080
The gentleman drinks Scotch.
Your drink, sir.

453
00:45:47,760 --> 00:45:51,080
Take this, sir.

454
00:45:52,760 --> 00:45:54,640
Will you drink now?

455
00:45:54,800 --> 00:45:56,760
Miss, don't say anything today.

456
00:45:56,920 --> 00:46:00,760
It is a matter of my life
and death. It is customary.

457
00:46:00,960 --> 00:46:03,760
If sir doesn't drink the
villagers will be displeased.

458
00:46:03,960 --> 00:46:06,240
Yes, of course.
Now I shall have to drink.

459
00:46:06,440 --> 00:46:08,080
Tikaram, give me the bottle too.

460
00:46:08,800 --> 00:46:12,080
- Praise be the Lord!
- Amen.

461
00:46:13,280 --> 00:46:15,240
- Praise be the Himalayas!
- Amen.

462
00:46:18,800 --> 00:46:20,760
- Praise be the Goddess!
- Amen.

463
00:46:25,320 --> 00:46:29,240
Sir, you are drunk.
Let me direct you to the jeep.

464
00:46:29,480 --> 00:46:30,920
- Where?
- To the jeep.

465
00:46:31,160 --> 00:46:33,120
- Come along, miss.
- Let's go.

466
00:46:38,000 --> 00:46:40,120
Be careful, Arun.
How will you walk?

467
00:46:40,240 --> 00:46:42,200
I can fly... Here I come.

468
00:46:43,800 --> 00:46:48,120
Fly away, sir.
Even I shall fly to my Champa.

469
00:46:48,240 --> 00:46:50,240
Will you fly? All right.

470
00:47:07,840 --> 00:47:10,800
- Stop the car!
- What happened?

471
00:47:12,360 --> 00:47:16,320
If I knew you would get drunk
I'd never have come with you.

472
00:47:17,000 --> 00:47:19,320
You're worrying unnecessarily.
I'm absolutely sober.

473
00:47:19,680 --> 00:47:22,480
- Come closer, darling.
- Let me go. You're drunk.

474
00:47:24,360 --> 00:47:28,800
I'm not intoxicated with alcohol
but with you and your eyes.

475
00:47:29,040 --> 00:47:32,680
- Don't touch me!
- Vinu, listen to me.

476
00:47:33,880 --> 00:47:35,520
- Vinu, just listen to me.

477
00:47:35,720 --> 00:47:40,360
Stop! Come back or
I'll jump off the mountain.

478
00:47:42,040 --> 00:47:45,160
Jump to your death.
I am not concerned with you.

479
00:47:46,440 --> 00:47:48,400
Not concerned with me?

480
00:47:48,560 --> 00:47:50,680
All right, I'm going.
Don't regret it later.

481
00:48:01,080 --> 00:48:04,880
Vinu, I'm going
straight to heaven.

482
00:48:06,480 --> 00:48:09,360
Praise the God!

483
00:48:27,440 --> 00:48:31,400
Arun, what have you done?
I was just joking.

484
00:48:32,600 --> 00:48:35,240
Believe me.
For the sake of God...

485
00:48:36,440 --> 00:48:41,560
And for the sake of our love
please come back.

486
00:48:42,120 --> 00:48:46,400
- Or else I shall jump.
- Jump.

487
00:48:50,640 --> 00:48:53,760
It is a pity that you thought
that I was so terrible.

488
00:48:54,280 --> 00:48:56,240
You mistook tea for alcohol.

489
00:48:56,440 --> 00:48:59,760
Drink it. It's water.
It was Tikaram's idea.

490
00:49:00,520 --> 00:49:03,240
You shouldn't have done this.

491
00:49:04,320 --> 00:49:06,280
I was scared to death.

492
00:49:06,480 --> 00:49:08,760
You are my life.

493
00:49:09,960 --> 00:49:11,920
Do you think that
I would have died so easily?

494
00:49:14,160 --> 00:49:16,280
My heart is still
beating wildly.

495
00:49:18,000 --> 00:49:21,280
- Don't ever play such a prank again.
- I won't.

496
00:49:21,800 --> 00:49:25,280
If I hadn't done it, I wouldn't
have seen this side of you.

497
00:49:26,320 --> 00:49:30,800
And the fury whose flush
causes every bud to bloom.

498
00:49:32,000 --> 00:49:33,440
Stop teasing.

499
00:53:48,600 --> 00:53:52,360
Among all the various sights,
this lake is the best.

500
00:53:53,400 --> 00:53:56,560
- It is known as Lake Asha(wish).
- That's a very strange name.

501
00:53:57,240 --> 00:54:01,880
It's believed if you throw a
coin and wish, it is fulfilled.

502
00:54:02,240 --> 00:54:04,720
That's amazing!
We should wish right away.

503
00:54:12,440 --> 00:54:13,560
What did you wish for?

504
00:54:15,440 --> 00:54:17,400
I have got everything
without wishing for it.

505
00:54:33,800 --> 00:54:35,080
Come.

506
00:54:43,960 --> 00:54:48,280
God bless you!
May God bless your marriage.

507
00:54:48,480 --> 00:54:52,120
- We are not married as yet.
- So what?

508
00:54:52,640 --> 00:54:54,600
This is Lord Shiva's temple.

509
00:54:54,800 --> 00:54:57,120
If you take your vows
and garland each other here...

510
00:54:57,480 --> 00:54:59,280
...you will be united forever.

511
00:55:02,000 --> 00:55:03,960
I'll be back, sir.

512
00:55:07,840 --> 00:55:09,800
Give me two garlands.

513
00:55:16,480 --> 00:55:18,640
Garland each other.

514
00:55:48,200 --> 00:55:50,000
Sir, get your picture taken.

515
00:55:50,200 --> 00:55:53,160
One copy in one minute
for just one rupee.

516
00:55:53,720 --> 00:55:55,680
Shall we?

517
00:55:57,560 --> 00:56:01,160
Come... Gaze at
each other lovingly.

518
00:56:05,560 --> 00:56:07,360
- Here. Take a look.
- The photograph is excellent!

519
00:56:07,560 --> 00:56:11,840
The photographer is also good.

520
00:56:12,120 --> 00:56:16,040
I have 40 years experience
but no one values it.

521
00:56:16,240 --> 00:56:19,360
You are great!
Take this.

522
00:56:20,400 --> 00:56:22,360
Take this garland too.

523
00:56:33,400 --> 00:56:36,360
We'll come here again...

524
00:56:37,600 --> 00:56:39,560
...and take a picture with our child.

525
00:56:40,400 --> 00:56:43,200
- What!
- I mean, with our son.

526
00:56:44,920 --> 00:56:47,560
We'll definitely have a boy first.

527
00:56:49,760 --> 00:56:51,400
Don't feel shy.

528
00:56:51,600 --> 00:56:53,720
Everyone gets married
and has children.

529
00:56:55,120 --> 00:56:57,080
First let the wedding get over.

530
00:56:58,120 --> 00:56:59,560
We're already married.

531
00:56:59,760 --> 00:57:05,080
We have already garlanded
each other in the temple.

532
00:57:06,440 --> 00:57:10,760
And our hearts became one
the first time we met.

533
00:57:12,200 --> 00:57:14,200
Isn't that right?

534
00:57:41,640 --> 00:57:44,640
Vandana, you are mine.

535
00:57:51,640 --> 00:57:52,800
Aren't you?

536
00:57:58,320 --> 00:57:59,640
Then reply.

537
00:58:05,360 --> 00:58:07,320
- Not like that. Say it aloud.

538
00:58:09,000 --> 00:58:10,480
- Aloud?

539
00:58:11,680 --> 00:58:14,640
I am yours.

540
00:58:42,200 --> 00:58:44,160
This is your room.

541
00:58:44,720 --> 00:58:46,840
You will find everything here.

542
00:58:47,200 --> 00:58:51,160
Let me know if you
need anything. Goodnight.

543
00:58:56,720 --> 00:58:58,680
A weird man.
He was talking gibberish.

544
00:59:00,080 --> 00:59:02,040
Are you feeling cold?
Remove this wet coat

545
00:59:04,240 --> 00:59:06,200
Wrap a blanket.

546
00:59:07,560 --> 00:59:09,200
Change into it.

547
00:59:09,560 --> 00:59:11,040
...Go on, change.

548
00:59:11,240 --> 00:59:12,680
- In your presence?
- I'll go out.

549
00:59:12,920 --> 00:59:15,360
- Then go!
- I'm going. Don't shout.

550
00:59:15,760 --> 00:59:18,040
Be a little polite.
...Strange girl!

551
00:59:19,240 --> 00:59:24,720
I'll light a fire to warm us,
as well as dry the clothes.

552
01:00:45,680 --> 01:00:50,640
- Why did you switch the light on?
- I don't like the darkness.

553
01:00:51,520 --> 01:00:54,120
There is no darkness
with you around.

554
01:00:54,360 --> 01:00:58,160
It's been 3 days
since we've come here...

555
01:00:58,840 --> 01:01:00,800
...and your poems
still haven't come to an end.

556
01:01:01,160 --> 01:01:03,320
My poem has just started.

557
01:01:03,840 --> 01:01:07,640
This lovely weather...
The pitter patter of the rain....

558
01:01:08,880 --> 01:01:11,640
And you in my arms...

559
01:01:12,880 --> 01:01:17,640
I feel like reciting poems
forever and ever.

560
01:05:29,640 --> 01:05:32,600
Vinu, why are you so worried?
What are you thinking about?

561
01:05:33,960 --> 01:05:35,920
How will I face my father now?

562
01:05:36,640 --> 01:05:38,600
Why? We haven't
done anything wrong.

563
01:05:40,960 --> 01:05:44,240
No, Arun. We lost control.

564
01:05:45,560 --> 01:05:48,040
Whatever happened was wrong.

565
01:05:49,160 --> 01:05:51,120
We should have
controlled ourselves.

566
01:05:51,960 --> 01:05:56,440
People are swept over
by their feelings sometimes.

567
01:05:57,360 --> 01:05:59,360
We were also swept away.

568
01:05:59,480 --> 01:06:02,600
But we haven't done anything
to be ashamed of.

569
01:06:04,160 --> 01:06:08,280
We have been united before God.
We are man and wife

570
01:06:08,640 --> 01:06:12,600
But... until we get married
in everyone's presence...

571
01:06:13,160 --> 01:06:14,120
We will.

572
01:06:14,240 --> 01:06:19,120
I'll go to Mathura tomorrow and
bring along my uncle and aunt.

573
01:06:19,680 --> 01:06:21,640
And then we'll be married
within the week.

574
01:06:22,360 --> 01:06:24,800
Please smile now.

575
01:06:27,160 --> 01:06:28,160
Let's go.

576
01:06:33,000 --> 01:06:35,000
Vinu, it's a strange thing.

577
01:06:36,360 --> 01:06:38,320
We didn't know each other
until a few days ago.

578
01:06:39,520 --> 01:06:41,480
And now we have become one.

579
01:06:41,840 --> 01:06:45,320
And soon we shall become a trio.

580
01:06:46,040 --> 01:06:48,480
- Stop it.
- What will you call him?

581
01:06:49,200 --> 01:06:51,160
- I'll decide when it happens.

582
01:06:53,200 --> 01:06:56,640
- How about the name Suraj?
- It's a good name for a boy.

583
01:06:57,200 --> 01:06:59,160
Out firstborn will be a boy.

584
01:06:59,560 --> 01:07:01,840
I'll take him
for a ride in my plane.

585
01:07:02,720 --> 01:07:05,840
So that he too becomes a pilot
in the Indian Air Force.

586
01:07:06,720 --> 01:07:08,160
A great pilot.

587
01:07:08,720 --> 01:07:14,160
You'll have to fulfill
this dream. You will, won't you?

588
01:07:27,080 --> 01:07:30,520
And also fix your wedding date.

589
01:07:31,240 --> 01:07:35,200
Because I can't bear to see the
lost look and the restlessness.

590
01:07:38,080 --> 01:07:42,360
And also get some "papads'
from Delhi. My stock is over.

591
01:07:43,400 --> 01:07:45,720
- Okay.
- It's Vandana.

592
01:07:47,760 --> 01:07:50,880
You stay put.
I'll convey your greetings.

593
01:07:52,240 --> 01:07:54,240
So that's how it is already.

594
01:07:55,080 --> 01:07:57,080
Greetings, sir!

595
01:07:57,240 --> 01:07:59,880
You! Why did you
come this far so early?

596
01:08:00,600 --> 01:08:01,880
- You're going far.

597
01:08:02,000 --> 01:08:04,720
- It's only for two days.

598
01:08:04,920 --> 01:08:06,240
You surely return day after
tomorrow, won't you?

599
01:08:06,360 --> 01:08:09,560
Yes. And I'll bring uncle
to your house right away.

600
01:08:11,120 --> 01:08:12,600
What will I do for two days?

601
01:08:15,280 --> 01:08:17,240
Until I return...

602
01:08:20,000 --> 01:08:22,760
...you can look at this.
They are our wedding photos.

603
01:08:26,800 --> 01:08:27,920
Shall I go now?

604
01:08:30,800 --> 01:08:32,760
I'm getting late.

605
01:09:04,160 --> 01:09:07,440
- Anything else?
- No. Go and stand at the gate.

606
01:09:07,840 --> 01:09:10,440
When you see them approaching
come and inform me.

607
01:09:13,160 --> 01:09:15,960
- Is everything ready?
- Yes.

608
01:09:16,360 --> 01:09:18,800
- I am a little late.
- Freshen up.

609
01:09:19,000 --> 01:09:21,000
They will be arriving shortly.

610
01:09:30,360 --> 01:09:33,640
- They have arrived.
- Go and inform father.

611
01:09:41,520 --> 01:09:44,160
Madan! Haven't they come along?

612
01:09:46,560 --> 01:09:48,840
- They couldn't make it.
- Why?

613
01:09:50,200 --> 01:09:53,000
- I have some bad news.
- Bad news?

614
01:09:53,360 --> 01:09:54,680
What happened?

615
01:09:54,800 --> 01:09:57,840
Arun's plane has crashed.
He is seriously injured.

616
01:09:58,000 --> 01:09:59,760
- Where is he?
- He is at the hospital.

617
01:09:59,880 --> 01:10:01,840
- I have come to fetch you.
- Let's go.

618
01:10:12,240 --> 01:10:14,200
When he regained consciousness
he asked for you.

619
01:10:14,560 --> 01:10:16,680
And so I can only permit
you to see him.

620
01:10:17,240 --> 01:10:19,200
The rest of you wait here.
...Come along, miss.

621
01:10:39,440 --> 01:10:41,400
Vandana has come.

622
01:10:42,920 --> 01:10:44,880
You have only 2 minutes.

623
01:11:16,320 --> 01:11:18,600
Vinu, don't cry.

624
01:11:21,640 --> 01:11:23,760
When my plane was descending...

625
01:11:25,640 --> 01:11:29,760
...I thought that
I would never see you again.

626
01:11:34,000 --> 01:11:35,960
I was facing death.

627
01:11:37,000 --> 01:11:38,960
And I wanted to live.

628
01:11:41,320 --> 01:11:45,120
For your sake
and the sake of our child.

629
01:11:48,320 --> 01:11:53,120
You remember my dream, don't you?

630
01:11:58,360 --> 01:12:00,320
You will have to fulfill it.

631
01:12:01,360 --> 01:12:04,640
You will have to make him a pilot.
You will do it, won't you?

632
01:12:05,840 --> 01:12:09,320
Don't speak. Rest quietly.

633
01:12:11,680 --> 01:12:15,480
Our firstborn will be a boy.

634
01:12:18,200 --> 01:12:21,320
But... I won't be
able to see him.

635
01:12:22,040 --> 01:12:26,000
What are you saying?
You'll get well soon.

636
01:12:33,560 --> 01:12:35,000
Whose shadow is this?

637
01:12:46,560 --> 01:12:48,160
Yes, Arun.

638
01:12:49,720 --> 01:12:51,680
Where is your father?

639
01:12:52,200 --> 01:12:54,200
He is outside with Madan.

640
01:12:54,720 --> 01:12:56,680
- Call him in.
- Don't speak.

641
01:12:56,880 --> 01:12:59,360
- Vinu, I want to say something.
- You can say it later.

642
01:12:59,560 --> 01:13:01,880
I don't have much time.

643
01:13:02,080 --> 01:13:05,040
Don't say that.
You will be fine.

644
01:13:05,560 --> 01:13:08,200
I want to tell him
that we are married.

645
01:13:08,560 --> 01:13:11,200
In the temple
in the presence of God.

646
01:13:11,600 --> 01:13:14,040
You can tell him later
when you feel better.

647
01:13:14,240 --> 01:13:16,200
Perhaps I won't get
an opportunity later.

648
01:13:16,600 --> 01:13:19,040
- Go and call him.
- All right.

649
01:13:22,760 --> 01:13:25,720
- Father!
- What happened, my child?

650
01:13:35,280 --> 01:13:37,760
What is it, son?

651
01:13:41,120 --> 01:13:43,560
Yes, my son. What is it?

652
01:14:11,640 --> 01:14:13,600
No!

653
01:14:14,480 --> 01:14:16,440
No!

654
01:14:29,600 --> 01:14:32,560
You're spoiling the memories
of Arun by crying like this.

655
01:14:35,080 --> 01:14:39,560
He was an Indian Air Force pilot
whose life was always in danger.

656
01:14:40,440 --> 01:14:45,240
Arun embraced death out of duty.

657
01:14:49,440 --> 01:14:53,880
A person doesn't weep
upon the death of such a man.

658
01:14:54,960 --> 01:14:56,920
A tribute should be offered.

659
01:14:59,800 --> 01:15:02,400
You are right, Madan

660
01:15:04,120 --> 01:15:07,080
I'll do my best...

661
01:15:08,280 --> 01:15:11,400
I will never cry.

662
01:15:28,280 --> 01:15:32,120
Among all the various sights,
this lake is the best.

663
01:15:33,280 --> 01:15:36,280
- It is known as Lake Asha(wish).
- That's a very strange name.

664
01:15:36,800 --> 01:15:41,400
It is believed if you throw a
coin and wish, it is fulfilled.

665
01:15:41,720 --> 01:15:44,240
That's wonderful!
We should wish right away.

666
01:15:46,440 --> 01:15:48,440
What did you wish for?

667
01:15:49,120 --> 01:15:51,120
I have got everything
without wishing for it.

668
01:16:08,800 --> 01:16:12,760
Where did you go?
I have been waiting for you.

669
01:16:17,480 --> 01:16:22,440
You cannot lighten your grief
by torturing yourself.

670
01:16:24,480 --> 01:16:27,120
You have to try to forget.

671
01:16:30,000 --> 01:16:34,120
I have something to tell you.

672
01:16:35,160 --> 01:16:38,480
Go on.

673
01:16:43,840 --> 01:16:45,320
Why have you
switched off the light?

674
01:16:45,840 --> 01:16:48,160
I won't be able
to say it in the light.

675
01:16:48,840 --> 01:16:50,440
What is it?

676
01:16:51,160 --> 01:16:55,000
I am pregnant.

677
01:17:01,160 --> 01:17:03,160
Pregnant!

678
01:17:09,680 --> 01:17:11,800
Vandana, don't cry.

679
01:17:13,360 --> 01:17:16,480
We'll leave for
another place tomorrow.

680
01:17:17,840 --> 01:17:20,680
- Where?
- To another town.

681
01:17:21,560 --> 01:17:25,520
This is the only solution
to avoid dishonour.

682
01:17:26,240 --> 01:17:28,560
Then we shall return
after a month or two.

683
01:17:29,000 --> 01:17:30,960
No one will know.

684
01:17:31,560 --> 01:17:36,680
Vandana, forget
your mistake forever.

685
01:17:37,880 --> 01:17:42,040
No, father.
I cannot call this a mistake.

686
01:17:43,400 --> 01:17:46,520
- I have to live for this child.
- What are you saying?

687
01:17:47,080 --> 01:17:50,400
Society will never accept
an unmarried girl's child.

688
01:17:50,560 --> 01:17:52,560
They will look
upon the child with hatred.

689
01:17:53,080 --> 01:17:55,200
And since you
weren't married to Arun...

690
01:17:55,400 --> 01:17:58,760
We got married in the temple.

691
01:17:58,840 --> 01:18:02,760
But you did not marry publicly
so society will never accept it.

692
01:18:03,400 --> 01:18:06,400
You have to consider
society and social customs.

693
01:18:07,920 --> 01:18:13,760
My world is now a separate place
where I do not fear society.

694
01:18:14,400 --> 01:18:16,440
You are not in your senses.

695
01:18:16,600 --> 01:18:19,720
When your child grows up
people will taunt him.

696
01:18:19,920 --> 01:18:21,560
They will malign you.

697
01:18:21,920 --> 01:18:26,400
And then one day your son
will ask you about his father.

698
01:18:26,760 --> 01:18:29,400
What will you answer?

699
01:18:29,920 --> 01:18:34,040
You cannot commit a wrong
in order to stand by a wrong.

700
01:18:34,440 --> 01:18:37,440
I have your best interests in
mind. Tomorrow we shall leave...

701
01:18:37,520 --> 01:18:40,440
No, father. I have
made my decision.

702
01:18:41,440 --> 01:18:44,560
As long as I live
I shall always worship him.

703
01:18:45,920 --> 01:18:48,920
And I shall face
every problem and difficulty.

704
01:18:51,280 --> 01:18:52,920
All right.

705
01:18:53,120 --> 01:18:59,240
If you have such courage I pray
that God may help you always.

706
01:19:05,280 --> 01:19:07,800
Welcome!
Hello!

707
01:19:08,960 --> 01:19:11,080
- Are you Arun's uncle?
- Yes.

708
01:19:12,440 --> 01:19:14,440
We have come from Bagdogra.

709
01:19:14,640 --> 01:19:19,080
I am Gopal Tripathi and
this is my daughter, Vandana.

710
01:19:20,640 --> 01:19:22,760
- Please be seated.
- Have a seat, Vandana.

711
01:19:23,960 --> 01:19:29,120
On the day of the accident
I received Arun's telegram...

712
01:19:30,000 --> 01:19:32,000
...saying that he was coming.

713
01:19:32,160 --> 01:19:35,280
And in the afternoon we received
the news that he was no more.

714
01:19:37,360 --> 01:19:40,160
Did Arun write to you
about Vandana?

715
01:19:41,000 --> 01:19:42,000
No.

716
01:19:43,840 --> 01:19:46,200
Arun often came to our home.

717
01:19:47,520 --> 01:19:50,160
My daughter and he fell
in love with each other.

718
01:19:51,200 --> 01:19:54,320
- And they got married.
- Married?

719
01:19:57,520 --> 01:20:01,640
And now she is
bearing Arun's child.

720
01:20:02,840 --> 01:20:06,000
It's surprising that
Arun did not tell me anything.

721
01:20:07,040 --> 01:20:09,040
He always took my advice.

722
01:20:10,040 --> 01:20:12,160
How did he marry
without informing me?

723
01:20:12,520 --> 01:20:15,360
Excuse me, dear.
Please come inside.

724
01:20:17,040 --> 01:20:19,040
Please excuse me for a moment.

725
01:20:25,520 --> 01:20:27,680
- What is the matter?
- Come, I'll tell you.

726
01:20:30,360 --> 01:20:32,360
- What happened?
- Get rid of that old man...

727
01:20:32,440 --> 01:20:34,520
... and his daughter.
- What are you saying?

728
01:20:34,720 --> 01:20:36,200
I have heard everything.

729
01:20:36,360 --> 01:20:39,200
After Arun's death we have,
inherited all his property.

730
01:20:39,560 --> 01:20:42,160
Do you want to accept this girl
and return Arun's share?

731
01:20:47,880 --> 01:20:51,240
My husband has fallen ill
suddenly. You may leave.

732
01:20:51,560 --> 01:20:54,040
Please don't say that.
This is your daughter-in-law.

733
01:20:54,560 --> 01:20:57,200
Daughter-in-law!
Whose daughter-in-law?

734
01:20:57,720 --> 01:21:01,560
My obedient nephew wouldn't
even step out without asking us.

735
01:21:01,720 --> 01:21:03,720
How could he marry
without my permission?

736
01:21:03,880 --> 01:21:07,040
When and where did this marriage
occur, and in whose presence?

737
01:21:07,400 --> 01:21:09,400
- In God's presence.
- Wonderful!

738
01:21:09,560 --> 01:21:11,560
The marriage took place in God's presence.

739
01:21:11,720 --> 01:21:14,720
And the man whom she married is no more.

740
01:21:14,920 --> 01:21:16,920
No witnesses and no evidence!

741
01:21:17,240 --> 01:21:19,880
I wonder whose sin
she is imposing on us?

742
01:21:20,560 --> 01:21:24,920
No. Please believe us.
This is Arun's child.

743
01:21:25,760 --> 01:21:30,200
My daughter and her child
are your family.

744
01:21:30,600 --> 01:21:32,120
Stop this nonsense!

745
01:21:32,160 --> 01:21:35,960
The girls in our family don't
bring a child before marriage.

746
01:21:36,280 --> 01:21:38,280
Take away this sinner from here.

747
01:21:38,440 --> 01:21:42,920
I beg of you. Please have pity
on her condition.

748
01:21:43,440 --> 01:21:46,280
Where will she go
if you don't accept her?

749
01:21:46,640 --> 01:21:50,480
Anywhere. There are rivers
and railway tracks.

750
01:21:50,800 --> 01:21:54,240
And if you are her father
why don't you poison her?

751
01:21:56,120 --> 01:21:58,480
I'm sorry.
Please don't say anything more.

752
01:21:59,480 --> 01:22:02,800
When the Lord
has not spared her...

753
01:22:03,640 --> 01:22:07,280
...I was wrong to expect
sympathy from a human being.

754
01:22:07,960 --> 01:22:11,320
I apologise for
wasting your time.

755
01:22:12,320 --> 01:22:14,320
God bless you!

756
01:22:15,480 --> 01:22:17,480
Let's go, my child.

757
01:22:24,800 --> 01:22:27,800
- Sit, my child.
- You go along, father.

758
01:22:28,480 --> 01:22:30,320
Leave me to my destiny.

759
01:22:32,480 --> 01:22:34,840
You were insulted because of me.

760
01:22:35,320 --> 01:22:37,960
It would have been better
if I had died.

761
01:22:38,160 --> 01:22:40,800
No, my child.
Why are you saying this?

762
01:22:41,480 --> 01:22:43,480
Why did God keep me alive?

763
01:22:44,000 --> 01:22:46,000
Why didn't I die
along with Arun?

764
01:22:46,840 --> 01:22:50,440
My child, you must
fulfill his dream.

765
01:28:28,160 --> 01:28:33,480
You seem to be hiding some grief.

766
01:28:34,840 --> 01:28:36,960
You can confide in me.

767
01:28:38,160 --> 01:28:41,800
You will feel much better
if you share your sorrows.

768
01:28:42,680 --> 01:28:45,280
I might be able to help you.

769
01:28:47,000 --> 01:28:51,440
No one can help me
but I'll tell you.

770
01:28:52,520 --> 01:28:54,520
I'll tell you everything.

771
01:28:55,000 --> 01:28:57,000
Orphanage.

772
01:29:39,120 --> 01:29:40,720
Why do you worry?

773
01:29:40,960 --> 01:29:43,080
You'll be separated from him
only until the morning.

774
01:29:43,440 --> 01:29:46,760
The office will open at 9 a.m.
You can come and adopt him then.

775
01:29:47,800 --> 01:29:52,240
Then your son will become yours
legally... Come.

776
01:29:54,320 --> 01:29:56,280
Come.

777
01:30:03,120 --> 01:30:06,480
I would like to adopt a child.

778
01:30:06,840 --> 01:30:10,800
- You! Are you married?
- No.

779
01:30:11,840 --> 01:30:15,280
Normally it is childless couples
who adopt a child.

780
01:30:16,520 --> 01:30:20,480
I have no one and
I feel very lonely so...

781
01:30:22,360 --> 01:30:24,640
I understand. Come along.

782
01:30:29,520 --> 01:30:31,480
All the infants
are in this room.

783
01:30:32,840 --> 01:30:34,800
He is a year old.

784
01:30:37,360 --> 01:30:39,320
- I want this baby.
- But he's so small.

785
01:30:39,520 --> 01:30:41,800
I like this child.

786
01:30:42,840 --> 01:30:44,800
You will have great difficulty
in raising such a small baby.

787
01:30:45,360 --> 01:30:48,480
A mother always takes care
of a small baby, doesn't she?

788
01:30:49,040 --> 01:30:51,480
If you like him
how can I object?

789
01:30:51,680 --> 01:30:53,640
Give the baby to the nurse.

790
01:30:54,880 --> 01:30:56,840
Come to my office.

791
01:31:01,360 --> 01:31:04,320
- Do you know what a baby needs?
- No.

792
01:31:04,720 --> 01:31:06,680
I'll give you a list.

793
01:31:08,520 --> 01:31:11,840
Here is a list of all the things
that are required.

794
01:31:12,200 --> 01:31:15,520
Buy these things. Meanwhile,
I'll prepare the forms.

795
01:31:23,400 --> 01:31:25,360
- I'm sorry.
- It's all right.

796
01:31:27,400 --> 01:31:30,360
I have brought more articles
than those in the list.

797
01:31:32,400 --> 01:31:34,360
This is known as
a twist of fate.

798
01:31:34,480 --> 01:31:37,520
The baby you had selected is
not destined to have all this.

799
01:31:38,400 --> 01:31:42,360
What!

800
01:31:42,880 --> 01:31:45,360
A man came after you left.

801
01:31:46,240 --> 01:31:49,680
His wife gave birth to a
stillborn for the third time.

802
01:31:50,560 --> 01:31:54,360
If she were told this she won't live. The only one
way to save her was to give her another child.

803
01:31:54,800 --> 01:31:56,560
And so you gave him my baby?

804
01:31:57,120 --> 01:32:00,400
You just wanted to adopt him.
You will get another child.

805
01:32:00,960 --> 01:32:02,920
But it was a matter of
life and death for that woman.

806
01:32:03,440 --> 01:32:07,080
Her need was greater than yours.

807
01:32:07,280 --> 01:32:10,080
No. How can I explain?
You've made a great blunder.

808
01:32:10,520 --> 01:32:13,920
You are worrying unnecessarily.
Come and select another child.

809
01:32:14,640 --> 01:32:17,920
No. I want that baby.
Who has that baby?

810
01:32:18,120 --> 01:32:21,600
They have legally adopted
the baby. You can't get him now.

811
01:32:21,800 --> 01:32:24,080
Please give me
their name and address.

812
01:32:24,440 --> 01:32:25,920
All right.

813
01:32:34,640 --> 01:32:36,760
- You adopted a child
yesterday, right? - What!

814
01:32:37,120 --> 01:32:39,920
I had already chosen that baby.
He was given to you erroneously.

815
01:32:40,120 --> 01:32:42,600
That's my baby. I want him back.
Please...

816
01:32:42,800 --> 01:32:44,840
Stop! Come inside.

817
01:32:49,160 --> 01:32:51,440
Come... Sit.

818
01:32:52,960 --> 01:32:55,760
Now tell me calmly about
who you are and what you want.

819
01:32:56,320 --> 01:32:58,600
- Aren't you Ram Prasad Saxena?
- Yes.

820
01:32:58,960 --> 01:33:02,600
My name is Vandana and
I want the baby you adopted.

821
01:33:03,000 --> 01:33:04,440
Why?

822
01:33:04,560 --> 01:33:07,440
- Because I am his mother.
- You?

823
01:33:08,160 --> 01:33:13,760
If you are his mother
how did he reach the orphanage?

824
01:33:14,640 --> 01:33:17,800
I had kept him there.
I had no choice.

825
01:33:19,000 --> 01:33:22,280
His father died
before his birth.

826
01:33:23,000 --> 01:33:25,800
And we weren't married
according to social norms.

827
01:33:26,680 --> 01:33:30,640
I was forced to leave my son
at the orphanage...

828
01:33:31,320 --> 01:33:34,800
...so that I could
adopt him legally the next day.

829
01:33:35,680 --> 01:33:37,800
Believe me. It's true.

830
01:33:38,680 --> 01:33:40,640
I can prove that
I am his mother.

831
01:33:40,840 --> 01:33:42,800
I can fetch the nurse
from the hospital.

832
01:33:43,520 --> 01:33:46,800
That won't be necessary.
I believe you.

833
01:33:47,840 --> 01:33:51,640
Give me back my son.
He is the only reason I'm alive.

834
01:33:52,000 --> 01:33:53,640
He is the last remembrance
of my husband.

835
01:33:53,840 --> 01:33:57,120
- Let him grow up in our home.
- Never!

836
01:33:57,520 --> 01:34:01,160
It's no use arguing.
You are a single woman.

837
01:34:01,560 --> 01:34:05,200
You will face problems at
every stage while raising him.

838
01:34:05,720 --> 01:34:07,680
But you won't be able
to face them.

839
01:34:07,880 --> 01:34:10,040
I am more aware than you are
of how cruel this world is.

840
01:34:11,080 --> 01:34:14,040
Does this mean that
you won't give me my baby?

841
01:34:15,240 --> 01:34:17,200
He will never lack anything
in this home.

842
01:34:17,560 --> 01:34:19,680
His every need
will be taken care of.

843
01:34:20,240 --> 01:34:23,680
He will have a father
and not one but two mothers.

844
01:34:24,240 --> 01:34:28,200
Now you decide whether or not
your son should live here.

845
01:34:28,720 --> 01:34:30,680
You are right but,
how will I live without him?

846
01:34:31,400 --> 01:34:34,720
How can I stay away from him?

847
01:34:35,240 --> 01:34:38,880
Maybe you didn't hear correctly.
He will have two mothers.

848
01:34:39,240 --> 01:34:43,200
You will always be with us, and
your son will be close to you.

849
01:34:44,080 --> 01:34:47,880
He'll be near...
But what about your wife?

850
01:34:48,600 --> 01:34:50,560
I will have to
explain to her somehow.

851
01:34:50,760 --> 01:34:53,720
I'll do that but I want you
to promise me something.

852
01:34:54,600 --> 01:34:57,720
- No one should learn that
he is your son. - But...

853
01:34:58,600 --> 01:35:00,880
You will have to make this
promise for your son's sake.

854
01:35:02,080 --> 01:35:07,560
- I promise. And I'm grateful...
- That's not necessary.

855
01:35:07,680 --> 01:35:09,640
Wipe away your tears
and come with me.

856
01:35:17,120 --> 01:35:19,400
Why is he crying?
What is the matter with him?

857
01:35:19,600 --> 01:35:21,560
I don't know.
He won't stop crying.

858
01:35:21,760 --> 01:35:23,720
- Give him to me.
- No.

859
01:35:24,120 --> 01:35:27,240
- Who is she?
- She's been sent by the doctor.

860
01:35:27,760 --> 01:35:32,080
You said you were weak and
needed a nurse for the baby.

861
01:35:32,280 --> 01:35:35,720
I had asked for an old nurse
and not someone like her.

862
01:35:36,440 --> 01:35:38,760
Only a woman who has a baby
knows how to care for one.

863
01:35:38,960 --> 01:35:41,400
I know how to care for a baby.

864
01:35:41,800 --> 01:35:46,400
Give me an opportunity, you'll
have no cause for complaint.

865
01:35:46,600 --> 01:35:50,240
The doctor said the same thing
and highly recommended her.

866
01:35:50,640 --> 01:35:52,600
But, why are you
in praises of her.

867
01:35:52,800 --> 01:35:55,920
It is very difficult
to get a qualified nurse.

868
01:35:56,440 --> 01:35:59,080
She is hapless
and she needs a job.

869
01:35:59,640 --> 01:36:02,440
Give him to me.
I'll quieten him.

870
01:36:03,480 --> 01:36:05,440
Give him to her.

871
01:36:05,600 --> 01:36:08,480
Be careful.

872
01:36:11,840 --> 01:36:13,800
Do you see that? He's quiet now.

873
01:36:14,000 --> 01:36:16,480
He is a darling boy.
He won't cry.

874
01:36:17,000 --> 01:36:19,960
- What have you named him?
- I like the name Suraj.

875
01:36:21,160 --> 01:36:27,480
Your name is Suraj(sun).
Suraj, keep shining always.

876
01:36:28,520 --> 01:36:31,320
Just in the day or else everyone
will have to keep awake at night.

877
01:36:32,680 --> 01:36:35,160
You rest now. I'll take him outside.

878
01:36:35,360 --> 01:36:37,320
No, give him to me.

879
01:36:37,680 --> 01:36:42,320
He shouldn't get more familiar
with his nurse than his mother.

880
01:36:43,200 --> 01:36:45,800
You may go now.
I'll call you when I need you.

881
01:36:46,880 --> 01:36:49,320
Come, I'll show you
to your room.

882
01:36:54,720 --> 01:36:56,160
My darling son.

883
01:37:35,560 --> 01:37:39,200
In spite of being so close
to your son I am so far away.

884
01:37:40,400 --> 01:37:42,360
How will I fulfil your dream?

885
01:37:43,560 --> 01:37:46,520
I am alone. Who will help me?

886
01:37:47,720 --> 01:37:49,040
Your son.

887
01:37:54,240 --> 01:37:56,200
You've already given up?

888
01:37:56,560 --> 01:37:58,880
You will always
have to face misfortune...

889
01:37:59,560 --> 01:38:01,520
...for the sake of your son.

890
01:38:03,560 --> 01:38:06,360
Keep him with you for a while.

891
01:38:09,400 --> 01:38:11,560
Return him before my wife
wakes up.

892
01:38:12,600 --> 01:38:14,080
All right.

893
01:38:22,640 --> 01:38:26,240
Do you recognise me?
I am your mother.

894
01:38:30,280 --> 01:38:32,440
You have to fulfil
your father's dream.

895
01:38:33,280 --> 01:38:36,080
You have to become a pilot.
A great pilot.

896
01:38:36,800 --> 01:38:38,760
Do you understand?

897
01:38:39,480 --> 01:38:40,600
You will become a pilot,
won't you?

898
01:39:02,160 --> 01:39:04,960
Today you are alone
with your mother after a year.

899
01:39:05,800 --> 01:39:08,280
Call me mother at least once.

900
01:39:09,840 --> 01:39:11,040
Call me mother.

901
01:39:12,480 --> 01:39:13,800
You can't speak now.

902
01:39:15,840 --> 01:39:17,800
You will say it when
you are big, won't you?

903
01:39:18,840 --> 01:39:20,800
My darling son!

904
01:39:21,320 --> 01:39:24,960
When you grow up you'll become the king of
the sky... like your father.

905
01:39:25,680 --> 01:39:26,640
Won't you?

906
01:42:42,880 --> 01:42:46,640
- Hi, sister!
- Shyam, it's you!

907
01:42:49,040 --> 01:42:52,480
- What a surprise!
- Didn't you get my cable?

908
01:42:52,720 --> 01:42:55,320
No. That's where this country lags behind.

909
01:42:55,720 --> 01:42:57,320
Nothing happens on time.

910
01:42:57,880 --> 01:43:00,680
Anyway... I have come along
instead of the telegram.

911
01:43:02,040 --> 01:43:03,480
You've changed so much.

912
01:43:09,040 --> 01:43:12,520
The whole world has changed
but your house is still the same.

913
01:43:13,040 --> 01:43:16,680
Now that I have come I shall
modernise the whole house.

914
01:43:17,040 --> 01:43:20,360
Crazy man!
See what I have brought for you.

915
01:43:21,400 --> 01:43:24,000
I have brought you
hair spray and perfume.

916
01:43:24,400 --> 01:43:27,200
And this is for the little one.
Where is he?

917
01:43:27,400 --> 01:43:30,360
- I haven't seen my nephew.
- I'll call him.

918
01:43:33,880 --> 01:43:36,520
- Where did you take him?
- I had taken him to the park.

919
01:43:36,720 --> 01:43:39,520
His uncle has come
and he wants to meet him.

920
01:43:39,720 --> 01:43:41,680
Yes, I have been waiting
since a long time.

921
01:43:43,080 --> 01:43:47,680
He has grow so big.
And quite good looking too.

922
01:43:48,560 --> 01:43:50,680
- Is Suraj always with you?
- Yes.

923
01:43:52,080 --> 01:43:54,040
Vandana, take him inside.

924
01:43:56,240 --> 01:43:57,520
Listen...

925
01:43:58,240 --> 01:44:02,200
Take Suraj to my room.
I have brought him lots of toys.

926
01:44:10,080 --> 01:44:13,880
- You?
- I came to photograph the sunrise...

927
01:44:14,080 --> 01:44:16,360
...but the beautiful moon has risen.
- Moon?

928
01:44:16,760 --> 01:44:20,720
Yes. A beautiful girl like you
is known as the moon.

929
01:44:21,600 --> 01:44:23,400
You shouldn't speak like that.

930
01:44:23,520 --> 01:44:25,600
This is where
our country lags behind.

931
01:44:26,240 --> 01:44:30,920
- It's time to give Suraj his milk.
- You have misunderstood me.

932
01:44:31,480 --> 01:44:33,440
I just wanted
to take a picture of you.

933
01:44:34,320 --> 01:44:36,280
- My picture?
- Yes.

934
01:44:38,480 --> 01:44:42,600
- Stand in this position.
- Wait. I'll be back in a moment.

935
01:44:46,320 --> 01:44:48,280
- Uncle will take a picture?
- Yes.

936
01:44:48,480 --> 01:44:50,120
Take my picture with Suraj.

937
01:44:50,320 --> 01:44:52,920
I thought that you had gone to
change and apply some make up.

938
01:44:53,160 --> 01:44:55,120
- Please hurry up.
- All right.

939
01:45:01,320 --> 01:45:04,440
- When will I get the picture?
- By tomorrow evening.

940
01:45:04,840 --> 01:45:07,800
- Will you give me a copy?
- Not just a copy...

941
01:45:08,160 --> 01:45:11,280
...I'll give you anything you want.
- Let's go.

942
01:45:11,480 --> 01:45:13,440
- Listen... Oh, dear!

943
01:45:24,000 --> 01:45:25,960
What are you doing in my room?

944
01:45:27,320 --> 01:45:30,120
- I have been waiting since long.
- For what?

945
01:45:31,000 --> 01:45:33,960
Fear not for I just came
to show you the picture.

946
01:45:38,160 --> 01:45:40,120
Thank you for the picture.

947
01:45:40,840 --> 01:45:42,960
But, it is not right for you
to be in my room at night.

948
01:45:44,160 --> 01:45:45,120
Why not?

949
01:45:46,840 --> 01:45:50,960
I am a servant and
I am unworthy of speaking to you.

950
01:45:51,840 --> 01:45:53,640
This is where
our country lags behind.

951
01:45:53,840 --> 01:45:55,960
In Europe there are
no class distinctions.

952
01:45:56,520 --> 01:45:58,480
There, anyone can
fall in love with anybody.

953
01:45:58,680 --> 01:46:00,800
You should be ashamed
of speaking like that.

954
01:46:02,040 --> 01:46:06,000
I am just like you.
Both of us are alone.

955
01:46:06,200 --> 01:46:09,320
- Go away!
- Both of us are young.

956
01:46:09,720 --> 01:46:12,800
- I beg of you.
- It is give and take.

957
01:46:13,200 --> 01:46:16,000
- Let go of me!
- I have pleased you so you please me now.

958
01:46:18,200 --> 01:46:20,480
Get out or I'll scream.

959
01:46:21,200 --> 01:46:25,840
If you scream, sister will wake
up and she'll throw you out.

960
01:46:26,720 --> 01:46:29,480
And I don't want you
to leave so soon.

961
01:46:33,760 --> 01:46:38,360
I don't take offence
when a girl slaps me.

962
01:46:40,080 --> 01:46:42,200
I jot down her name in my diary.

963
01:46:43,440 --> 01:46:47,560
And I settle my accounts
with her someday.

964
01:47:11,840 --> 01:47:15,560
I'm going out and
I shall be a little late.

965
01:47:16,120 --> 01:47:18,880
It's time for Suraj
to return from school.

966
01:47:19,760 --> 01:47:22,920
Make some juice for him. One more thing ...
There's no one at home so take care.

967
01:47:37,120 --> 01:47:39,080
- Oh, it's you!
- Yes.

968
01:47:39,280 --> 01:47:43,560
- Isn't sister at home?
- No, she has gone out.

969
01:47:44,280 --> 01:47:46,240
- Out!

970
01:47:48,800 --> 01:47:50,760
I telephoned sister
and sent her out.

971
01:47:52,120 --> 01:47:54,240
You? Why?

972
01:47:54,960 --> 01:47:57,440
Do you remember what
I had told you the other day?

973
01:47:58,280 --> 01:48:01,080
I don't take offence
when a girl slaps me.

974
01:48:02,120 --> 01:48:04,080
I will write down her name in my diary.

975
01:48:04,800 --> 01:48:08,280
And then I settle my accounts someday.
That day has come.

976
01:48:09,480 --> 01:48:11,280
Stay away!

977
01:48:11,880 --> 01:48:13,280
Don't come closer.

978
01:48:13,480 --> 01:48:17,280
I've yearned for you.

979
01:48:18,320 --> 01:48:21,120
- But I shall make you mine today.
- I beg at your feet. Please leave me.

980
01:48:21,480 --> 01:48:24,760
But I want to embrace you instead.

981
01:48:39,360 --> 01:48:43,480
How much longer
will you avoid me?

982
01:48:45,880 --> 01:48:47,840
Leave me!

983
01:48:58,200 --> 01:49:00,160
Let me go! Please!

984
01:49:01,560 --> 01:49:03,520
Help!

985
01:49:05,880 --> 01:49:07,840
Uncle, open the door!

986
01:49:09,880 --> 01:49:12,520
- Let go of nurse!
- Help!

987
01:49:19,880 --> 01:49:21,520
Help!

988
01:49:24,720 --> 01:49:26,680
Let go of her!

989
01:49:33,880 --> 01:49:36,520
- I won't let you go today.
- Let go of me!

990
01:49:42,400 --> 01:49:44,840
Uncle, let go of her!

991
01:49:55,400 --> 01:49:56,880
Uncle!

992
01:49:57,400 --> 01:50:00,200
Don't worry, son.
Nothing has happened.

993
01:50:00,560 --> 01:50:03,040
You haven't seen anything.
You don't know what happened.

994
01:50:03,400 --> 01:50:05,720
Come with me.

995
01:50:07,240 --> 01:50:09,720
Go to your room
and change your clothes.

996
01:50:10,400 --> 01:50:11,200
You don't know anything
about this...

997
01:50:11,400 --> 01:50:15,720
...and don't tell anyone
anything. Do it for my sake. Go!

998
01:50:29,080 --> 01:50:31,120
How did this glass break?

999
01:50:32,280 --> 01:50:35,400
- What has happened to Shyam?
- Oh God! He's bleeding.

1000
01:50:39,440 --> 01:50:42,760
- Brother! Blood!
- What happened?

1001
01:50:51,000 --> 01:50:52,960
Who has killed my brother?

1002
01:50:55,640 --> 01:50:58,960
You! You have killed my brother.

1003
01:50:59,840 --> 01:51:02,960
You have killed my brother.

1004
01:51:03,360 --> 01:51:06,800
Ask her if she has
killed my brother. Ask her.

1005
01:51:07,640 --> 01:51:08,800
Did you do it?

1006
01:51:13,840 --> 01:51:18,960
Yes. I have killed him.

1007
01:51:46,840 --> 01:51:49,640
- How are you and how is sister?
- Everyone is fine.

1008
01:51:50,360 --> 01:51:51,840
Your son is also fine.

1009
01:51:58,040 --> 01:52:00,640
How did this happen?

1010
01:52:01,360 --> 01:52:04,640
I never thought that
I would see you in this state.

1011
01:52:05,360 --> 01:52:07,320
You didn't even allow me
to hire a lawyer for you.

1012
01:52:09,360 --> 01:52:13,160
Do you know that you could be sentenced to 14 years imprisonment.

1013
01:52:15,200 --> 01:52:16,840
I know.

1014
01:52:16,960 --> 01:52:20,840
I have committed murder
and I deserve to be punished.

1015
01:52:23,720 --> 01:52:25,480
Look at me, Vandana.

1016
01:52:33,040 --> 01:52:35,160
A murderer cannot look
into anyone's eyes like that.

1017
01:52:35,880 --> 01:52:38,520
His face
doesn't show such dignity.

1018
01:52:40,040 --> 01:52:45,000
Vandana, I had only seen stone
idols of Gods and Goddesses.

1019
01:52:46,600 --> 01:52:52,720
Now I can see a living Goddess
in the form of a human...

1020
01:52:53,280 --> 01:52:55,880
...in the form of a mother.
What are you saying?

1021
01:52:56,600 --> 01:52:58,560
Please don't embarrass me.

1022
01:52:58,920 --> 01:53:02,720
Any mother would have done
the same to save her son.

1023
01:53:03,600 --> 01:53:08,080
That's fine but how are you
going to spend 14 years in jail.

1024
01:53:09,120 --> 01:53:11,080
How will you stay away
from you son?

1025
01:53:13,120 --> 01:53:14,560
I trust you.

1026
01:53:15,120 --> 01:53:19,400
I believe that you will
raise him as your own son.

1027
01:53:20,440 --> 01:53:22,720
That you will spare no expenses
for his education.

1028
01:53:24,600 --> 01:53:28,560
And someday he will become
a great Air Force pilot.

1029
01:53:29,600 --> 01:53:32,920
14 years is not a long time.
It will pass quickly.

1030
01:53:34,280 --> 01:53:38,240
When I am released
my son will be 22 years old.

1031
01:53:39,280 --> 01:53:42,760
I'll forget all my troubles
when I see him.

1032
01:53:43,640 --> 01:53:47,600
Besides making your son
a good person and a good pilot...

1033
01:53:48,120 --> 01:53:50,080
...I will teach him
something else too.

1034
01:53:52,120 --> 01:53:54,240
- What?
- I'll teach him to worship you.

1035
01:53:55,120 --> 01:53:59,240
No! Don't ever tell him
that I am his mother.

1036
01:53:59,800 --> 01:54:03,280
He should never learn
that his mother was in prison.

1037
01:54:04,120 --> 01:54:07,920
For otherwise he will not
be able to hold his head high.

1038
01:54:08,800 --> 01:54:10,760
All right. I won't tell him.

1039
01:54:12,480 --> 01:54:14,760
Your time is up.
She has to be taken to court.

1040
01:54:15,640 --> 01:54:19,120
Vandana, don't you want
to see your son once?

1041
01:54:20,640 --> 01:54:25,440
No. I don't want you to bring
him to the jail or to the court.

1042
01:54:34,640 --> 01:54:36,120
Come.

1043
01:54:45,680 --> 01:54:47,280
Come along.

1044
01:55:06,200 --> 01:55:08,160
Vandana, the Jailer
has sent for you.

1045
01:55:28,560 --> 01:55:29,680
Come in.

1046
01:55:38,720 --> 01:55:39,680
Sit.

1047
01:55:49,720 --> 01:55:53,520
Today you have completed
12 years of your sentence.

1048
01:55:55,400 --> 01:55:59,520
You have been released 2 years
earlier for good behaviour.

1049
01:56:02,760 --> 01:56:04,720
Where do you want to go?

1050
01:56:06,600 --> 01:56:10,880
I don't know.
I haven't thought about it.

1051
01:56:12,440 --> 01:56:16,400
I have gathered information
about Mr Ram Prasad...

1052
01:56:18,080 --> 01:56:19,560
...as you asked me to.
He is no more.

1053
01:56:21,760 --> 01:56:26,880
What! What about his wife and his son?

1054
01:56:27,760 --> 01:56:29,560
I couldn't trace them.

1055
01:56:29,760 --> 01:56:31,720
They don't live
in that city anymore.

1056
01:56:32,280 --> 01:56:35,560
I tried to trace them
but no one could help me.

1057
01:56:39,920 --> 01:56:43,400
That's why I wanted to know
if you had any other relatives.

1058
01:56:44,760 --> 01:56:47,400
No, I have no one.

1059
01:56:48,760 --> 01:56:50,720
Where will you go?

1060
01:56:52,760 --> 01:56:54,400
Where will I go?

1061
01:56:56,640 --> 01:56:58,120
Can I be of any assistance?

1062
01:57:00,320 --> 01:57:04,600
If you could get me a job...

1063
01:57:06,160 --> 01:57:11,440
I forgot that I was a convict.

1064
01:57:12,840 --> 01:57:14,800
Who will give me a job?

1065
01:57:15,160 --> 01:57:18,640
No respectable person
will even talk to me.

1066
01:57:22,840 --> 01:57:26,480
Will you live in an old jailer's
house as his sister?

1067
01:57:29,160 --> 01:57:31,640
- Pardon me.
- I am retiring tomorrow.

1068
01:57:32,840 --> 01:57:34,960
Like you, I, too will be released
from this prison tomorrow.

1069
01:57:36,160 --> 01:57:39,480
I have a small house in Delhi.
My daughter lives there.

1070
01:57:40,680 --> 01:57:42,640
She studies in college.

1071
01:57:42,840 --> 01:57:44,800
The poor girl's mother is no more.

1072
01:57:45,000 --> 01:57:46,960
There's no one else
to look after her.

1073
01:57:48,680 --> 01:57:52,160
I would be happy if
you undertook her responsibility.

1074
01:57:52,840 --> 01:57:57,000
Will you give me
such a great responsibility?

1075
01:57:58,360 --> 01:58:02,480
A woman who has been
in prison for 12 years.

1076
01:58:03,040 --> 01:58:05,640
I have had the opportunity
to know you better.

1077
01:58:06,520 --> 01:58:10,320
A jailer is
a good judge of character.

1078
01:58:12,040 --> 01:58:14,640
I do not have a sister.

1079
01:58:16,040 --> 01:58:20,160
I'll consider myself lucky
if you become my sister.

1080
01:58:21,360 --> 01:58:26,000
You are already doing a favour by helping a helpless woman like me.

1081
01:58:27,040 --> 01:58:29,000
Please don't embarrass me, brother.

1082
01:58:30,360 --> 01:58:36,520
I shall never forget your favour.

1083
01:58:41,200 --> 01:58:43,160
Greetings, sir!

1084
01:58:43,880 --> 01:58:46,160
Fetch the bags.
Come, Vandana.

1085
01:58:50,880 --> 01:58:52,840
This is your new house.

1086
01:59:01,120 --> 01:59:03,200
- Greetings, sir!
- How are you?

1087
01:59:03,320 --> 01:59:07,240
- I am fine, sir.
- Come in, Vandana.

1088
01:59:08,960 --> 01:59:10,880
- Where is Renu?
- She must be inside.

1089
01:59:11,040 --> 01:59:13,000
I'll call her.

1090
01:59:24,120 --> 01:59:27,080
- Greetings, sir!
- What's this?

1091
01:59:27,600 --> 01:59:31,920
As you have made the prison
your home for 20 years...

1092
01:59:32,440 --> 01:59:35,400
...I'm sure that you would want
to make your home a prison.

1093
01:59:36,120 --> 01:59:40,080
So I have tried to create
the prison atmosphere.

1094
01:59:42,960 --> 01:59:45,080
Silly girl!
Change your clothes!

1095
01:59:46,480 --> 01:59:50,440
- All right.
- Stop! Have you no shame?

1096
01:59:50,960 --> 01:59:55,080
- Daddy, why should I fell shy of you?
- She does as she likes.

1097
02:00:00,800 --> 02:00:05,280
Did you see that? My darling daughter.
What do you think of her?

1098
02:00:05,960 --> 02:00:08,920
Very beautiful
and very innocent.

1099
02:00:09,480 --> 02:00:11,440
Really? Well, let's shake hands on that.

1100
02:00:11,560 --> 02:00:13,600
No! That won't do.

1101
02:00:14,320 --> 02:00:16,920
This is Vandana.
I have made her my sister.

1102
02:00:17,320 --> 02:00:19,280
- She will stay with us.
- Really!

1103
02:00:19,800 --> 02:00:23,280
Touch her feet.
God bless you, my dear!

1104
02:00:23,640 --> 02:00:26,280
If you are my father's sister
you're my aunt now.

1105
02:00:27,000 --> 02:00:29,960
Until now
I only lacked a mother.

1106
02:00:30,840 --> 02:00:34,120
After seeing you I feel that
I shall no longer lack a mother.

1107
02:00:34,840 --> 02:00:36,600
There is some charisma
on your face.

1108
02:00:37,840 --> 02:00:43,280
Mother! My dear, no one can
take the place of a mother.

1109
02:00:45,000 --> 02:00:49,960
But I promise that
you will never miss a mother.

1110
02:00:51,520 --> 02:00:54,120
First let me show you your home.

1111
02:00:54,680 --> 02:00:57,280
After that freshen up
and go to sleep.

1112
02:00:57,840 --> 02:01:03,120
When you wake up
I have lots to talk about.

1113
02:01:04,840 --> 02:01:07,520
You've forgotten your father
after meeting your aunt.

1114
02:01:08,000 --> 02:01:11,000
You didn't ask me
if I needed anything.

1115
02:01:12,320 --> 02:01:14,520
I know what you want.

1116
02:01:14,880 --> 02:01:18,200
A steaming cup of tea
with ginger and black pepper.

1117
02:01:19,040 --> 02:01:21,360
Here it is.
Let's go.

1118
02:01:25,080 --> 02:01:27,040
- Can I ask you something?
- Yes.

1119
02:01:27,160 --> 02:01:29,360
You won't be returning
to prison anymore, will you?

1120
02:01:29,720 --> 02:01:31,680
- What do you mean?
- I feel very bad, sir.

1121
02:01:31,880 --> 02:01:35,520
You come home for a few days
and then return to prison again.

1122
02:01:37,080 --> 02:01:39,040
I won't be returning
to prison anymore.

1123
02:01:39,160 --> 02:01:41,120
Now go and prepare my bath.

1124
02:01:52,920 --> 02:01:54,880
Aunty, I'm leaving
otherwise I shall get late.

1125
02:01:55,080 --> 02:01:57,040
I have to go to the airport
to receive a friend.

1126
02:01:57,240 --> 02:02:00,880
What is your friend's name?

1127
02:02:01,240 --> 02:02:03,360
Name? It's Kamla.

1128
02:02:06,080 --> 02:02:08,040
Oh! So Madhuri has
now become Kamla.

1129
02:02:10,920 --> 02:02:12,880
Sit.

1130
02:02:14,920 --> 02:02:21,880
It's very difficult...
...for a nice girl like you to lie.

1131
02:02:21,920 --> 02:02:24,560
I shouldn't have lied to you.
I'm sorry.

1132
02:02:24,920 --> 02:02:27,720
Actually he is a boy.
He's very nice.

1133
02:02:29,080 --> 02:02:31,880
- Does your father know?
- Not yet.

1134
02:02:32,600 --> 02:02:36,240
You will have to help me.
Come along to the airport and meet him.

1135
02:02:36,440 --> 02:02:40,400
And if you like him, make sure
that father likes him too.

1136
02:02:42,280 --> 02:02:47,240
- Suppose I don't like him?
- Decide that after you have met him.

1137
02:02:47,600 --> 02:02:49,560
Aunty, please come along.

1138
02:02:56,440 --> 02:02:59,080
- Is this the boy?
- No, aunty.

1139
02:03:03,120 --> 02:03:04,760
Prakash, hasn't he come?

1140
02:03:05,120 --> 02:03:07,080
Since I have come
he will also follow.

1141
02:03:07,640 --> 02:03:09,600
First comes Prakash(light)
And then comes Suraj(the sun).

1142
02:03:09,800 --> 02:03:11,800
Look, there's your Suraj.

1143
02:03:26,000 --> 02:03:28,120
Look! That's Suraj.

1144
02:04:02,200 --> 02:04:04,480
You've become so fat
pining for me.

1145
02:04:06,200 --> 02:04:08,480
What are you doing?
My aunty has come with me.

1146
02:04:10,200 --> 02:04:12,160
Aunty, this is Suraj.

1147
02:04:25,360 --> 02:04:29,320
I have seen you
somewhere before.

1148
02:04:31,040 --> 02:04:35,000
Me?

1149
02:04:36,200 --> 02:04:38,160
But I have never seen you
before.

1150
02:04:40,560 --> 02:04:44,160
It's strange!
Your face is so familiar.

1151
02:04:44,720 --> 02:04:47,000
Do you know why
I have brought aunty along?

1152
02:04:48,240 --> 02:04:51,840
If she likes you
she will recommend you to father.

1153
02:04:52,720 --> 02:04:55,200
Which means that
your fate lies in aunt's hand.

1154
02:04:55,560 --> 02:04:59,200
My fate? Aunty, your niece is my life.

1155
02:04:59,400 --> 02:05:01,360
And your decision is
a matter of my life and death.

1156
02:05:03,080 --> 02:05:04,840
I'm sure that you want me to live.

1157
02:05:05,080 --> 02:05:08,040
Aunty, give us the verdict
of your approval quickly.

1158
02:05:08,560 --> 02:05:10,520
Wait!

1159
02:05:10,600 --> 02:05:14,520
Before giving your verdict
put me in the place of your son.

1160
02:05:16,240 --> 02:05:18,920
I...

1161
02:05:20,440 --> 02:05:24,920
I would have set
your wedding date right away.

1162
02:05:27,440 --> 02:05:30,760
Wait here. I'll change and come.
I'll be back soon.

1163
02:05:46,800 --> 02:05:48,760
- Come inside, son.
- No, aunty. I'll come later.

1164
02:05:49,280 --> 02:05:51,920
Come in for short while.
Come and have some tea.

1165
02:05:52,320 --> 02:05:54,920
Aunty, I have to report
to my chief in half an hour.

1166
02:05:56,120 --> 02:05:58,080
- I'll come later.
- All right.

1167
02:06:07,800 --> 02:06:10,280
Renu, your aunty is very nice.

1168
02:06:11,960 --> 02:06:13,920
She left us alone on purpose.

1169
02:06:15,320 --> 02:06:16,280
What do you mean?

1170
02:06:22,320 --> 02:06:24,280
- What chance?
- Didn't you understand?

1171
02:06:26,320 --> 02:06:28,280
- Didn't you understand?
- No.

1172
02:06:28,640 --> 02:06:32,120
- You'll understand.
- Let me go! Suppose someone sees us?

1173
02:06:35,480 --> 02:06:38,640
- When will it take place?
- What?

1174
02:06:39,000 --> 02:06:42,120
Our wedding.
Renu, I can't wait any longer.

1175
02:06:42,840 --> 02:06:45,960
- I want to get married at once.
- At once? - Yes.

1176
02:06:46,680 --> 02:06:48,960
Right now you have
to report to your boss.

1177
02:06:49,320 --> 02:06:51,640
I forget everything
when I see you.

1178
02:06:53,000 --> 02:06:54,960
There's only 15 minutes left.
Say yes.

1179
02:07:00,000 --> 02:07:02,480
What are you still doing here? Bye.

1180
02:07:06,000 --> 02:07:07,640
Come along.

1181
02:07:11,360 --> 02:07:14,800
- Daddy, I want you to meet...
- I have heard about him. Sit down.

1182
02:07:17,840 --> 02:07:21,360
I'm meeting you for the first time...
...and so I'd like to introduce...

1183
02:07:21,400 --> 02:07:23,440
- I know all about you.
- Sir?

1184
02:07:27,000 --> 02:07:30,680
A pilot in the Indian Air Force. You know my daughter since 2 years and you want to marry her.

1185
02:07:33,920 --> 02:07:35,360
Anything else?

1186
02:07:37,920 --> 02:07:40,520
My father is no more
and my mother wants...

1187
02:07:40,720 --> 02:07:44,520
Your mother wants you to
marry my daughter immediately.

1188
02:08:03,240 --> 02:08:05,200
Come along.

1189
02:08:07,920 --> 02:08:10,400
I don't understand why you've
brought me on the terrace...

1190
02:08:10,480 --> 02:08:12,720
...when there are so many
spacious rooms in your house?

1191
02:08:13,240 --> 02:08:16,200
Since the time you've come
we haven't been alone.

1192
02:08:17,440 --> 02:08:20,240
I thought that you might
have something to say to me.

1193
02:08:20,440 --> 02:08:23,240
- Yes, I've been waiting
to do so. - What is it?

1194
02:08:23,440 --> 02:08:26,040
- I had a dream last night.
- What dream?

1195
02:08:26,440 --> 02:08:28,400
- Butter me up first.
- Suraj, please tell me.

1196
02:08:28,600 --> 02:08:30,880
- It was a strange dream.
- What was it?

1197
02:08:31,280 --> 02:08:34,240
War had started. There were
clouds of smoke everywhere.

1198
02:08:34,440 --> 02:08:36,880
The fire of machine guns
and tanks.

1199
02:08:37,120 --> 02:08:40,080
I run towards my plane
and start it.

1200
02:08:41,440 --> 02:08:45,080
When I reach a great speed
I notice an enemy plane.

1201
02:08:45,440 --> 02:08:48,920
I aim and fire.
The enemy plane is destroyed.

1202
02:08:49,440 --> 02:08:53,920
I charge towards the radar
and crash with my plane.

1203
02:08:54,440 --> 02:08:56,080
After that?

1204
02:08:59,960 --> 02:09:02,920
- Aunty, you?
- I came to hang up the clothes. I'm leaving now.

1205
02:09:04,440 --> 02:09:08,400
We just came here
for some fresh air.

1206
02:09:08,640 --> 02:09:10,600
No, aunty. She's lying.

1207
02:09:10,960 --> 02:09:12,760
She brought me here
to show me the moon.

1208
02:09:12,960 --> 02:09:17,760
And she said that the moon
looks very beautiful...
...amidst the palm trees.

1209
02:09:18,960 --> 02:09:22,240
- It's a lie! Aunty, he's lying.
- I know that. But it is a moonless night.

1210
02:09:23,320 --> 02:09:27,120
So it won't be visible.

1211
02:09:27,640 --> 02:09:29,640
But you'll be able to see it.

1212
02:09:30,360 --> 02:09:32,320
If it won't rise...

1213
02:09:32,840 --> 02:09:35,960
The moon that
you wish to see is this.

1214
02:09:39,680 --> 02:09:41,960
The moon in the sky
gets hidden sometimes.

1215
02:09:42,840 --> 02:09:46,160
But this moon will always
shine brightly in your life.

1216
02:09:48,360 --> 02:09:50,320
Aunty, promise me one thing.

1217
02:09:52,520 --> 02:09:53,480
Yes?

1218
02:09:53,840 --> 02:09:55,800
That you'll become my mother
in the next life.

1219
02:09:57,680 --> 02:09:59,640
I am your mother now too.

1220
02:10:02,360 --> 02:10:05,000
You continue your conversation.
I'll get the tea.

1221
02:10:12,720 --> 02:10:16,000
Your aunt is so nice.
There's something about her.

1222
02:10:17,040 --> 02:10:20,680
Whenever she looks at me,
something happens to me.

1223
02:10:22,560 --> 02:10:26,520
- And when I look at you?
- When you look at me disaster strikes.

1224
02:10:26,720 --> 02:10:29,160
I am knocked out
and I lose control.

1225
02:10:29,560 --> 02:10:31,840
Really? Just a glance
is so effective?

1226
02:10:31,920 --> 02:10:34,160
Not just a glance
but a loving gaze.

1227
02:10:34,560 --> 02:10:36,840
Love is something
that drives people crazy.

1228
02:10:37,200 --> 02:10:38,840
Perhaps you are also
going to go crazy.

1229
02:10:39,040 --> 02:10:41,520
If you do not love me, I go mad.

1230
02:10:42,720 --> 02:10:44,680
Who told you that I loved you?

1231
02:10:45,560 --> 02:10:47,000
- Haven't you said it?
- No.

1232
02:10:47,080 --> 02:10:49,360
- Then say it right now.
- No.

1233
02:10:49,560 --> 02:10:51,680
- I'll make you say it.
- Never.

1234
02:10:51,880 --> 02:10:54,680
So that's how it is!
Then get ready.

1235
02:10:54,880 --> 02:10:58,040
Answer all my questions
truthfully.

1236
02:11:00,880 --> 02:11:02,520
Tell me...

1237
02:11:03,080 --> 02:11:04,880
- Is it spring?
- What?

1238
02:11:05,080 --> 02:11:07,680
- I asked if it was spring.
- Yes.

1239
02:11:08,920 --> 02:11:11,040
- Are the buds in bloom?
- Yes.

1240
02:11:11,240 --> 02:11:13,040
So this means that you love me.

1241
02:14:41,760 --> 02:14:43,720
See, I made you say it!

1242
02:14:44,800 --> 02:14:48,080
Aunty I invited Suraj to dinner
without informing you about it.

1243
02:14:48,440 --> 02:14:51,920
If I knew that you'd make so many things...
...I wouldn't have invited him.

1244
02:14:52,800 --> 02:14:57,240
You will soon learn what a pleasure...
...it is for a mother to feed her son.

1245
02:15:04,800 --> 02:15:07,600
Why can't you come?!
The dinner table has been set.

1246
02:15:07,960 --> 02:15:09,920
Aunty has made
special dishes for you.

1247
02:15:11,280 --> 02:15:14,240
What did you say? You've been
ordered to go to the front?

1248
02:15:15,120 --> 02:15:17,600
No, I won't be afraid
and I won't cry.

1249
02:15:18,640 --> 02:15:21,080
When do you have to go?
Within an hour!

1250
02:15:21,800 --> 02:15:23,760
Yes, I'm coming.

1251
02:15:24,800 --> 02:15:26,200
I heard everything.

1252
02:15:26,320 --> 02:15:29,440
If you don't mind, can I
accompany you to the airport?

1253
02:15:29,640 --> 02:15:31,080
Yes, aunty.

1254
02:15:32,640 --> 02:15:34,600
Come, aunty.

1255
02:15:39,480 --> 02:15:41,800
Aunty, I'm going.
I'll destroy everyone.

1256
02:15:43,680 --> 02:15:46,160
Bless me that I might return
and eat your cooking.

1257
02:15:47,200 --> 02:15:49,640
Go, my son. Return with victory.

1258
02:15:59,520 --> 02:16:01,480
Why are you crying?
Say it with a smile.

1259
02:16:04,360 --> 02:16:06,320
Keep smiling until I return.

1260
02:16:18,560 --> 02:16:20,320
This is the All India Radio.

1261
02:16:20,560 --> 02:16:22,680
The recent reports inform us
that...

1262
02:16:23,040 --> 02:16:28,000
...the Indian Air Force has shot
down three of the enemy bombers.

1263
02:16:28,560 --> 02:16:30,840
And they have destroyed
one enemy camp.

1264
02:17:33,440 --> 02:17:37,040
This is Prakash.
I have bad news.

1265
02:17:37,760 --> 02:17:39,560
Suraj's plane hasn't returned
as yet.

1266
02:17:39,920 --> 02:17:42,560
- There's still no news
about him. - No!

1267
02:17:42,920 --> 02:17:45,040
Please don't worry.
The search is on.

1268
02:17:45,800 --> 02:17:47,760
His companions
did not see his plane crash.

1269
02:17:48,120 --> 02:17:52,280
- We believe that he is still alive.
- Then why hasn't he returned?

1270
02:17:54,120 --> 02:17:56,080
He must have fallen
in the hands of the enemy.

1271
02:17:56,480 --> 02:18:00,600
- We cannot be sure
at this stage. - No!

1272
02:18:06,480 --> 02:18:08,600
What is the matter?
Was it news about Suraj?

1273
02:18:09,000 --> 02:18:12,120
His plane is lost.
What will happen now, daddy?

1274
02:18:12,480 --> 02:18:16,960
Suraj's plane is lost. I hope
that nothing has happened to him.

1275
02:18:18,840 --> 02:18:21,280
No, don't say that.

1276
02:18:22,000 --> 02:18:23,960
Suraj is alive.

1277
02:18:24,160 --> 02:18:26,440
My blessings will
save him from every peril.

1278
02:18:28,480 --> 02:18:30,280
Don't cry, my child.

1279
02:18:30,360 --> 02:18:34,280
I believe that
he will return soon.

1280
02:18:35,840 --> 02:18:41,640
He has told me that he will return...
...and eat what I have cooked.

1281
02:19:21,840 --> 02:19:23,800
You took away my husband.

1282
02:19:24,520 --> 02:19:26,480
I didn't say a word.

1283
02:19:27,040 --> 02:19:31,000
You took away my father
and I didn't say a word.

1284
02:19:32,520 --> 02:19:35,160
You were unjust to me
at every stage.

1285
02:19:36,360 --> 02:19:38,480
I never complained.

1286
02:19:39,880 --> 02:19:41,320
But...

1287
02:19:41,400 --> 02:19:47,000
If anything happens to my son
I will not consider you God.

1288
02:19:48,200 --> 02:19:50,360
That you are not
the protector of the universe.

1289
02:19:51,080 --> 02:19:53,720
You are stone.

1290
02:19:55,600 --> 02:19:59,040
I have never asked you
for anything, O Lord.

1291
02:20:00,240 --> 02:20:04,200
Today I ask for my son's life.

1292
02:20:05,600 --> 02:20:07,720
Please grant my son his life!

1293
02:20:11,920 --> 02:20:13,880
Take my life instead.

1294
02:20:25,600 --> 02:20:28,400
Renu, I have good news for you.

1295
02:20:28,760 --> 02:20:30,080
Hello, Uncle and Aunty!

1296
02:20:30,280 --> 02:20:32,720
- Where is Suraj?
- He is at a military hospital.

1297
02:20:34,120 --> 02:20:37,400
There's no cause for worry.
He's perfectly all right.

1298
02:20:37,760 --> 02:20:40,720
A bullet hit his shoulder
and now it's out.

1299
02:20:41,120 --> 02:20:43,760
He'll be dancing within a week.

1300
02:20:45,120 --> 02:20:49,240
I told you that nothing would happen to Suraj. God heard my prayers.

1301
02:20:49,960 --> 02:20:51,920
This means that our hero
is perfectly all right.

1302
02:20:52,280 --> 02:20:53,920
He is no ordinary hero.

1303
02:20:54,120 --> 02:20:57,080
The plane caught fire
and it crashed.

1304
02:20:57,960 --> 02:21:00,600
He landed with his parachute
right in the midst of the enemy.

1305
02:21:01,640 --> 02:21:03,400
20 miles away from our side...

1306
02:21:03,520 --> 02:21:07,240
...he came back
avoiding the shower of bullets.

1307
02:21:07,800 --> 02:21:09,440
- Can we meet Suraj?
- Sure.

1308
02:21:09,640 --> 02:21:12,440
The visiting hours are from
4 to 6. You can meet him then.

1309
02:21:12,800 --> 02:21:14,760
Goodbye!

1310
02:21:22,320 --> 02:21:24,280
Come, aunty.

1311
02:21:25,480 --> 02:21:27,440
This is Suraj's room.
You can go in.

1312
02:21:34,480 --> 02:21:36,760
- Hello, aunty!
- Are you all right?

1313
02:21:36,840 --> 02:21:38,440
- Perfect!

1314
02:21:38,800 --> 02:21:41,280
I'm sorry that I cannot touch
your feet as my arm is wounded.

1315
02:21:42,640 --> 02:21:45,120
- It's not necessary.
- Why not?

1316
02:21:45,320 --> 02:21:48,280
I had left with your blessings
so I returned alive.

1317
02:21:49,160 --> 02:21:50,440
No, my son.

1318
02:21:50,720 --> 02:21:54,120
Even death fears men who sacrifice their life... for their country.

1319
02:21:54,480 --> 02:21:57,440
What did aunty say?
Oh...I've got it.

1320
02:21:57,880 --> 02:22:00,640
Wonderful! Your words have
strengthened my determination.

1321
02:22:02,200 --> 02:22:04,160
Do you know what
my mother would have said?

1322
02:22:04,240 --> 02:22:05,840
What have you done, my son?

1323
02:22:05,960 --> 02:22:08,000
I told you not to join
the defence services.

1324
02:22:08,200 --> 02:22:09,320
You are my only son.

1325
02:22:09,520 --> 02:22:11,480
You were saved this time but,
what will happen the next time?

1326
02:22:12,360 --> 02:22:13,840
And then she would start crying.

1327
02:22:14,040 --> 02:22:18,840
For the sake of her child
a mother has to cry sometime.

1328
02:22:20,040 --> 02:22:24,160
Some shed tears and
some swallow their tears.

1329
02:22:27,040 --> 02:22:30,840
- What is the matter, aunty?
- Nothing.

1330
02:22:33,400 --> 02:22:36,520
Aunty, can I ask you something?

1331
02:22:38,720 --> 02:22:41,840
Don't you have any children?

1332
02:22:44,040 --> 02:22:47,200
I had a son.
He was just like you.

1333
02:22:49,240 --> 02:22:50,840
I lost him.

1334
02:22:58,240 --> 02:23:02,200
- Your mother has come to see you.
- Please send her in, doctor.

1335
02:23:03,560 --> 02:23:05,520
- I'll leave now.
- Why?

1336
02:23:05,720 --> 02:23:08,200
- You must meet my mother.
- I'll meet her some other time.

1337
02:23:08,440 --> 02:23:10,440
Renu, you stay here.

1338
02:23:20,080 --> 02:23:22,040
What has happened to my son?

1339
02:23:23,240 --> 02:23:25,720
I've often told you
not to join the Air Force.

1340
02:23:26,240 --> 02:23:28,200
You are my only child.

1341
02:23:28,440 --> 02:23:31,200
By God's grace
your life was saved today.

1342
02:23:31,600 --> 02:23:34,400
If anything happens
in the future what will I do?

1343
02:23:36,080 --> 02:23:39,200
Wasn't I right? Mother, nothing
has happened to me.

1344
02:23:39,600 --> 02:23:43,040
Go home and make offerings
at the Lord's temple.

1345
02:23:43,280 --> 02:23:45,240
And this also won't happen again.

1346
02:23:45,320 --> 02:23:47,400
Quiet! You speak as though
you know what will happen.

1347
02:23:51,760 --> 02:23:53,720
God bless you!

1348
02:23:54,600 --> 02:23:55,560
Who is she?

1349
02:23:55,640 --> 02:23:58,400
The doctor has forbidden me
to speak in excess.

1350
02:23:58,600 --> 02:24:00,240
You tell her.

1351
02:24:00,640 --> 02:24:04,280
I am Renu.
My father is a retired jailer.

1352
02:24:04,800 --> 02:24:07,280
Oh! So you are Renu!

1353
02:24:08,160 --> 02:24:10,120
He had written to me about you.

1354
02:24:10,800 --> 02:24:13,440
But, whatever he had written
was not sufficient.

1355
02:24:13,840 --> 02:24:15,760
Do you know
what the doctor has said?

1356
02:24:16,320 --> 02:24:20,120
He said that unless we marry
soon, I won't get better.

1357
02:24:20,320 --> 02:24:23,120
Oh God! I'll go and fix
the wedding date right away.

1358
02:24:23,640 --> 02:24:25,640
Yes, of course.
I have selfish motives.

1359
02:24:26,000 --> 02:24:30,120
Once you are married you won't
risk your life so readily.

1360
02:24:30,480 --> 02:24:33,280
Touch mother's feet again
on my behalf.

1361
02:24:33,480 --> 02:24:37,120
Touch my feet when
you are my daughter-in-law.

1362
02:24:47,360 --> 02:24:48,280
Brother-in-law!

1363
02:24:51,360 --> 02:24:54,640
You!

1364
02:24:56,360 --> 02:24:59,480
When I saw Suraj
I realised that he was your son.

1365
02:25:00,000 --> 02:25:01,640
Arun's son.

1366
02:25:02,000 --> 02:25:06,480
But when he mentioned
his father's name I kept silent.

1367
02:25:08,840 --> 02:25:13,000
He still doesn't know
that I am his mother.

1368
02:25:14,960 --> 02:25:19,480
Promise me that you will
never tell him the truth.

1369
02:25:21,200 --> 02:25:23,160
He won't learn from me.

1370
02:25:23,360 --> 02:25:27,840
But if there is a God...
...he'll surely learn of his real parents someday.

1371
02:25:31,880 --> 02:25:33,840
- Hello, mother!
- God bless you!

1372
02:25:33,920 --> 02:25:35,320
Come in.

1373
02:25:35,720 --> 02:25:37,840
Suraj's mother has come.

1374
02:25:38,200 --> 02:25:40,160
Hello! Please have a seat.

1375
02:25:40,720 --> 02:25:43,480
Sit down, my child.
I'm pleased to meet you.

1376
02:25:44,040 --> 02:25:45,480
Renu, fetch some tea.

1377
02:25:45,720 --> 02:25:48,520
No, that won't be necessary.
Sit beside me.

1378
02:25:49,360 --> 02:25:51,840
It is customary to offer
something to a guest.

1379
02:25:52,360 --> 02:25:54,840
I have come to meet you
as it is customary to do so.

1380
02:25:55,720 --> 02:25:59,000
You are the girl's father
and I am the boy's mother.

1381
02:25:59,720 --> 02:26:01,520
Both of us should consent
to this alliance.

1382
02:26:02,720 --> 02:26:04,360
Times have changed.

1383
02:26:04,640 --> 02:26:07,200
In these times the girl and
the boy decide for themselves.

1384
02:26:07,760 --> 02:26:10,240
The parents just need
to give their blessings.

1385
02:26:11,440 --> 02:26:13,400
Our happiness lies
in their happiness.

1386
02:26:13,760 --> 02:26:17,720
For the sake of their happiness...
we should set the date immediately.

1387
02:26:18,440 --> 02:26:20,080
It is my wish too.

1388
02:26:20,600 --> 02:26:22,720
- She's feeling shy.
- She's a child.

1389
02:26:23,440 --> 02:26:26,240
Vandana,
Suraj's mother has come.

1390
02:26:29,600 --> 02:26:31,000
She is my sister.

1391
02:26:34,960 --> 02:26:37,240
Hello!

1392
02:26:50,440 --> 02:26:54,400
- May I speak to your sister.
- Sure.

1393
02:27:27,160 --> 02:27:31,120
Don't hide your face.
I recognised you as soon as I saw you.

1394
02:27:33,480 --> 02:27:35,920
My husband died 4 years ago.

1395
02:27:38,000 --> 02:27:41,600
I have looking for you ever since...
in order to apologise to you.

1396
02:27:46,400 --> 02:27:48,960
- To apologise to me?
- Yes.

1397
02:27:50,000 --> 02:27:53,600
He told me everything about you
before his death.

1398
02:27:54,320 --> 02:27:59,440
- So you know that...
- Suraj is your son.

1399
02:28:01,000 --> 02:28:06,280
And I also know the circumstances...
under which my brother died.

1400
02:28:09,000 --> 02:28:11,800
I am ashamed of myself.

1401
02:28:13,360 --> 02:28:15,840
I was very mean to you.

1402
02:28:17,880 --> 02:28:22,360
- Forgive me if you can.
- What are you doing, sister?

1403
02:28:23,400 --> 02:28:25,360
Since the day
I have learned the truth...

1404
02:28:26,080 --> 02:28:31,680
...I have not considered Suraj as my son

1405
02:28:32,720 --> 02:28:37,000
And I am waiting for the moment
when I can give him to you.

1406
02:28:39,560 --> 02:28:42,200
Suraj must never learn
the truth.

1407
02:28:45,080 --> 02:28:47,040
He is an excellent pilot.

1408
02:28:47,880 --> 02:28:50,360
He will soon marry Renu.

1409
02:28:52,080 --> 02:28:54,360
They have a bright future
together.

1410
02:28:55,720 --> 02:29:01,040
If he learns that it is not you
but I who am his mother...

1411
02:29:02,080 --> 02:29:05,040
...a woman who has spent
12 years in prison for murder...

1412
02:29:06,400 --> 02:29:08,360
...he will be shattered.

1413
02:29:09,240 --> 02:29:11,360
He won't be able
to hold his head high.

1414
02:29:11,920 --> 02:29:14,200
His life will be destroyed.

1415
02:29:14,760 --> 02:29:16,720
Don't you care
about your own life?

1416
02:29:17,080 --> 02:29:22,720
Won't you accept your son
after going through so much pain?

1417
02:29:23,080 --> 02:29:27,720
Only you have the right
to be called his mother.

1418
02:29:28,600 --> 02:29:31,560
You are responsible
for what he is today.

1419
02:29:31,920 --> 02:29:33,880
But, Suraj is your son.

1420
02:29:33,960 --> 02:29:37,040
No, sister.
I don't want to hear anything.

1421
02:29:37,920 --> 02:29:42,040
You will have to promise that
you will not tell Suraj anything.

1422
02:29:42,600 --> 02:29:43,960
Why are you silent?

1423
02:29:44,080 --> 02:29:46,880
Promise me that you will
not tell Suraj anything.

1424
02:29:47,280 --> 02:29:51,560
All right, Vandana.
I'll do as you say.

1425
02:30:03,600 --> 02:30:05,560
I've got it!

1426
02:30:06,960 --> 02:30:09,080
What did you get?

1427
02:30:09,280 --> 02:30:11,400
Did you find some treasure?

1428
02:30:11,600 --> 02:30:13,080
He is screaming as though
he has found a treasure.

1429
02:30:13,160 --> 02:30:14,920
You'll dance for joy
when you hear the news.

1430
02:30:15,120 --> 02:30:17,800
My name and my picture
will be in the papers tomorrow.

1431
02:30:18,480 --> 02:30:20,440
At least tell us about it.

1432
02:30:20,640 --> 02:30:27,440
- What is the matter?
- Aunty, read this out to them.

1433
02:30:39,520 --> 02:30:41,120
Yes. With your blessings.

1434
02:30:41,680 --> 02:30:43,640
- Let me also see it.
- Wait!

1435
02:30:44,360 --> 02:30:46,320
Oh, all right!
Let her also read it.

1436
02:30:47,160 --> 02:30:49,120
Congratulations, Suraj!
I am delighted.

1437
02:30:51,160 --> 02:30:53,960
My friends have thrown a party
and I'd like to take Renu along.

1438
02:30:54,520 --> 02:30:56,400
Yes, of course.
...Go and get ready, my child.

1439
02:30:56,520 --> 02:30:58,480
Go and get ready, my child.

1440
02:30:58,680 --> 02:31:00,640
- Which is your favourite colour?
- What!

1441
02:31:00,720 --> 02:31:02,720
I mean.
Which colour sari should I wear?

1442
02:31:03,000 --> 02:31:04,800
Uh... pink.

1443
02:31:05,040 --> 02:31:06,800
Yes, I have a pink sari.
...But, it has big flowers.

1444
02:31:07,040 --> 02:31:09,000
The big flowers will
look very nice. Go.

1445
02:31:09,680 --> 02:31:12,000
Your daughter is very innocent.

1446
02:31:51,400 --> 02:31:54,000
Your dream has come true.

1447
02:31:57,200 --> 02:31:59,360
Miss, your airman has come!

1448
02:32:03,040 --> 02:32:05,000
Renu, are you all right?

1449
02:32:05,720 --> 02:32:07,360
- What's happening?
- Nothing, sir.

1450
02:32:07,560 --> 02:32:09,360
- Where is Renu?
- She is inside the house.

1451
02:32:09,560 --> 02:32:10,840
I am aware of that but,
where is she?

1452
02:32:10,920 --> 02:32:12,920
She's inside the house.

1453
02:32:14,240 --> 02:32:16,200
Are you all right?!

1454
02:32:16,720 --> 02:32:18,360
Yes, sir.

1455
02:32:25,120 --> 02:32:27,400
Aunty, give me my clothes.

1456
02:32:27,760 --> 02:32:29,720
It's getting late.
Suraj will be here soon.

1457
02:32:33,800 --> 02:32:35,400
I have arrived.

1458
02:32:35,480 --> 02:32:37,560
I thought that it was aunty.
Get out from my room!

1459
02:32:37,800 --> 02:32:39,760
Come out.
There's no need to feel shy.

1460
02:32:39,840 --> 02:32:41,840
Our wedding is also fixed.

1461
02:32:42,280 --> 02:32:44,560
Shameless man!

1462
02:32:45,440 --> 02:32:47,600
- Are you going or...
- Get dressed quickly.

1463
02:32:47,800 --> 02:32:49,760
We are getting late for the function.

1464
02:32:49,960 --> 02:32:51,920
- Give me something to wear.
- That's more like it. - A shoe?

1465
02:32:55,960 --> 02:32:57,920
- So you won't listen?
- No.

1466
02:32:59,960 --> 02:33:02,240
What have you done?!
You have ruined my uniform.

1467
02:33:02,480 --> 02:33:03,600
What will I wear
to the function now?

1468
02:33:06,960 --> 02:33:08,080
What happened?

1469
02:33:09,120 --> 02:33:11,920
Aunty, see what
this crazy girl has done.

1470
02:33:12,120 --> 02:33:14,120
She has wet my clothes.
She threw water on me.

1471
02:33:14,480 --> 02:33:16,920
The party begins in a little while.

1472
02:33:17,120 --> 02:33:19,440
How can I go to the function in these clothes?
Your love and affection has spoilt...

1473
02:33:22,960 --> 02:33:25,760
- What happened, aunty?
- Nothing

1474
02:33:26,480 --> 02:33:29,440
Don't worry. I'll iron them out.

1475
02:33:30,480 --> 02:33:32,440
- Renu...
- Hey fatso!

1476
02:33:32,520 --> 02:33:34,600
Your clothes have come. Get ready soon.

1477
02:33:35,800 --> 02:33:38,120
- Tut, tut! You shouldn't say that.
- Yes, you're right.

1478
02:33:46,840 --> 02:33:48,960
What is the function about?

1479
02:33:49,160 --> 02:33:52,600
They'll distribute awards
and deliver lectures.

1480
02:33:56,320 --> 02:33:59,800
Sit.

1481
02:34:00,480 --> 02:34:02,440
If it isn't too much of a bother
could I have a cup to tea?

1482
02:34:05,680 --> 02:34:07,960
I'll get it.

1483
02:35:01,240 --> 02:35:02,360
Dear sister Vandana.

1484
02:35:02,920 --> 02:35:05,520
Suraj has finished
his Air Force training...

1485
02:35:06,400 --> 02:35:08,720
...and now he is
an Indian Air Force pilot.

1486
02:35:09,760 --> 02:35:12,360
The responsibility
that you delegated to me...

1487
02:35:12,440 --> 02:35:15,360
...to fulfil
Suraj's father's dream...

1488
02:35:16,400 --> 02:35:18,720
...has been fulfilled by me.

1489
02:35:22,080 --> 02:35:26,560
I am happy that
I could fulfill my promise.

1490
02:35:27,440 --> 02:35:29,400
I won't survive for long.

1491
02:35:29,920 --> 02:35:33,560
I might not live
until your release from prison.

1492
02:35:34,920 --> 02:35:38,560
But I pray that...

1493
02:35:39,280 --> 02:35:43,720
...you get back your son, Suraj.

1494
02:35:44,440 --> 02:35:46,400
From Ram Prasad Saxena.

1495
02:38:00,040 --> 02:38:02,360
It's ready. Take it.

1496
02:38:11,440 --> 02:38:14,200
- What are you looking at, son?
- Nothing.

1497
02:38:15,400 --> 02:38:20,200
I think that...
you should come along with me.

1498
02:38:21,920 --> 02:38:25,200
I? What will I do there?

1499
02:38:26,080 --> 02:38:29,680
This the happiest day
of my life.

1500
02:38:31,080 --> 02:38:33,880
Won't you come along
on this day?

1501
02:38:34,920 --> 02:38:38,760
Your mother and Renu
will be accompanying you.

1502
02:38:39,120 --> 02:38:42,240
You will have to accompany me.
I told you that I'm not coming.

1503
02:38:43,280 --> 02:38:46,600
All right. If you don't come
along I won't go either.

1504
02:38:46,960 --> 02:38:48,920
You shouldn't fuss.

1505
02:38:49,120 --> 02:38:52,240
- I'm ready. Let's go.
- Renu, she is accompanying us.

1506
02:38:52,640 --> 02:38:54,600
It is your responsibility
to get her ready.

1507
02:38:55,120 --> 02:38:57,080
I'm waiting in the hall below.

1508
02:39:01,800 --> 02:39:03,440
Let's go, aunty.

1509
02:39:04,640 --> 02:39:08,760
I welcome you on behalf of the
Delhi Citizens Committee.

1510
02:39:09,120 --> 02:39:13,920
And I request the chief guest
to start the function.

1511
02:39:21,640 --> 02:39:25,120
In today's function we
have gathered to congratulate...

1512
02:39:25,200 --> 02:39:27,440
...those brave young pilots...

1513
02:39:28,160 --> 02:39:31,960
...who have risked their lives
for their country

1514
02:39:32,160 --> 02:39:34,760
And in the process they have set
such standards of bravery...

1515
02:39:35,160 --> 02:39:40,600
...that every citizen of India
is proud of them.

1516
02:39:41,960 --> 02:39:46,960
The State has already honoured
them and will continue to do so.

1517
02:39:48,000 --> 02:39:50,800
But I believe that
there is no greater award...

1518
02:39:50,880 --> 02:39:54,280
...than the love
and good wishes of the people.

1519
02:39:55,160 --> 02:39:58,280
The first name in the list
of award winners is...

1520
02:40:17,000 --> 02:40:21,960
You're surprised...
...because you've seen flight lieutenant Arun Varma.

1521
02:40:23,840 --> 02:40:25,520
You look like Arun Varma.

1522
02:40:27,360 --> 02:40:29,320
I am his son.

1523
02:40:30,000 --> 02:40:31,480
Arun Varma died...

1524
02:40:31,680 --> 02:40:33,960
I shall tell you everything
after the function.

1525
02:40:35,040 --> 02:40:39,480
But permit her presence here
when I receive the medal.

1526
02:40:40,920 --> 02:40:42,000
You mean...

1527
02:40:42,360 --> 02:40:45,040
Because of whom
this day is a part of my life.

1528
02:40:45,720 --> 02:40:51,200
She's responsible for what I am...
...and for the award that I'm receiving.

1529
02:40:52,240 --> 02:40:55,040
Please permit her to participate
in this happy moment of my life.

1530
02:40:55,760 --> 02:40:59,200
I would consider it
the greatest honour.

1531
02:41:02,800 --> 02:41:05,040
I also would like to meet
this person. Please call her.

1532
02:41:10,760 --> 02:41:14,360
Mother... Come here, mother.

1533
02:41:16,520 --> 02:41:19,200
Go, Vandana.
Suraj is calling you.

1534
02:41:19,840 --> 02:41:21,800
- Me?
- Yes, mother.

1535
02:41:22,920 --> 02:41:24,040
I am calling you.

1536
02:41:29,080 --> 02:41:32,040
Did you tell Suraj everything?

1537
02:41:33,760 --> 02:41:36,880
No, a son has recognised
his mother.

1538
02:41:38,440 --> 02:41:40,400
Go.

1539
02:41:42,280 --> 02:41:43,280
Come, mother.

1540
02:41:49,480 --> 02:41:53,560
Vandana... Come.

1541
02:42:02,440 --> 02:42:05,080
Do you remember
I had told you that...

1542
02:42:05,600 --> 02:42:09,400
...a day would come when
your son would call you mother?

1543
02:42:12,600 --> 02:42:14,560
Come.

1544
02:42:42,480 --> 02:42:44,920
Perhaps you haven't
recognised her, sir.

1545
02:42:45,800 --> 02:42:47,640
Do you recollect that she had come with Arun... for your birthday party?

1546
02:42:47,680 --> 02:42:49,720
Yes, I have recognised her.

1547
02:42:50,360 --> 02:42:52,160
But I don't understand how...

1548
02:42:54,200 --> 02:42:58,640
Before marrying according
to custom, he...

1549
02:43:03,040 --> 02:43:07,640
And that is why she was unable
to accept her son until today.

1550
02:43:08,520 --> 02:43:10,840
She faced her troubles alone...

1551
02:43:10,920 --> 02:43:13,160
...so that I could become
a pilot in the Indian Air Force.

1552
02:43:14,040 --> 02:43:16,000
Because she had promised
my father.

1553
02:43:19,680 --> 02:43:24,000
There are some things...

1554
02:43:24,360 --> 02:43:26,320
...that are greater than
the limits of society.

1555
02:43:27,040 --> 02:43:28,680
You are one of them.

1556
02:43:28,880 --> 02:43:32,320
And I think that you should
give your son his medal.

1557
02:43:35,360 --> 02:43:36,760
I?

1558
02:43:42,360 --> 02:43:46,360
A woman who despite losing
her husband in an air crash...

1559
02:43:46,720 --> 02:43:50,520
...has the courage
to make her only son a pilot...

1560
02:43:51,200 --> 02:43:55,840
I believe that her son should
receive the medal from her.

1561
02:44:02,240 --> 02:44:06,520
Vandana, your years of penance
has borne fruit.

1562
02:44:09,560 --> 02:44:11,520
Take this.

1563
02:44:34,400 --> 02:44:36,360
Mother!

1564
02:44:39,400 --> 02:44:41,360
My son!

1565
02:44:49,760 --> 02:44:53,920
Today I can hold my head up
with pride and say...

1566
02:44:54,960 --> 02:44:59,920
...that I do not know
how much penance I have done...

1567
02:45:00,040 --> 02:45:04,080
...in order to become the son
of a great mother like you.
