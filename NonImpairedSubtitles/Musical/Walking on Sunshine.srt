What? What am I supposed
to say? I'm thrilled?

182
00:11:54,586 --> 00:11:57,042
- Well...
- I'm thrilled it's not Doug.

183
00:11:57,043 --> 00:11:59,426
I'll drink to that.

184
00:11:59,462 --> 00:12:01,036
I look forward to meeting him.

185
00:12:01,037 --> 00:12:05,386
Well, you will, tonight. There's a dinner.
You're gonna love him.

186
00:12:06,912 --> 00:12:10,256
Anyway... what about you?
Anything to report?

187
00:12:10,982 --> 00:12:14,169
Finals went OK. I may
have messed up one paper.

188
00:12:14,170 --> 00:12:17,251
No, I don't mean boring stuff.
I meant boys.

189
00:12:18,970 --> 00:12:20,581
Oh, come on! You're out
of the library now.

190
00:12:20,582 --> 00:12:23,077
You've got to let your hair down
and your inner goddess out.

191
00:12:23,078 --> 00:12:27,609
I'm not like you. I don't go all wobbly
every time a boy takes his shirt off.

192
00:12:27,610 --> 00:12:31,915
Maybe she's just saving
herself for her old flame?

193
00:12:32,755 --> 00:12:33,829
Who? What?

194
00:12:33,830 --> 00:12:37,409
- This is where T fell in love too, isn't it?
- Taylor doesn't fall in love,

195
00:12:37,411 --> 00:12:40,166
- she's too sensible.
- OK.

196
00:12:41,971 --> 00:12:45,196
What? I'm your sister and
I don't know this. Hello?

197
00:12:45,197 --> 00:12:47,001
It was just a holiday romance.

198
00:12:47,002 --> 00:12:50,418
Just a holiday romance?
Why didn't you tell me?

199
00:12:50,419 --> 00:12:52,684
You were in the middle of one of
your worst breakups with Doug.

200
00:12:52,685 --> 00:12:54,412
So, what happened?

201
00:12:54,413 --> 00:12:59,058
Nothing. The holiday ended and uni
started and life just got in the way.

202
00:12:59,059 --> 00:13:03,052
This is so exciting! You're back here.
Maybe you could rekindle the whole thing.

203
00:13:03,053 --> 00:13:04,818
No...

204
00:13:04,819 --> 00:13:06,354
He was off to travel the world.

205
00:13:06,355 --> 00:13:10,041
Exs are like fireworks.
Never go back to them.

206
00:13:10,042 --> 00:13:12,698
Either they blow up
in your face or...

207
00:13:14,150 --> 00:13:15,540
Or they go all limp.

208
00:13:18,566 --> 00:13:22,521
I think I might get changed
and pop down to the beach.

209
00:13:22,522 --> 00:13:25,483
See if I recognise any
of the old crowd.

210
00:13:25,594 --> 00:13:27,594
OK.

211
00:13:52,973 --> 00:13:54,318
Taylor!

212
00:13:55,046 --> 00:13:56,236
Oh, my God!

213
00:13:56,237 --> 00:13:58,924
Oh, my God!
I can't believe you're here!

214
00:13:58,925 --> 00:14:00,921
Three years we've been waiting
for you, We'd given up.

215
00:14:00,922 --> 00:14:04,799
- And you, when did you get back?
- I never left. I couldn't leave Enrico.

216
00:14:04,800 --> 00:14:06,374
What?

217
00:14:06,682 --> 00:14:08,420
Does Raf know you're here?

218
00:14:09,485 --> 00:14:11,299
Ciao, bella!

219
00:14:13,862 --> 00:14:15,589
- What are you doing here?
- Oh, that's nice!

220
00:14:15,590 --> 00:14:19,775
No, no. Dio mio, it's great to see you.
But it's been ages, babes.

221
00:14:19,776 --> 00:14:22,006
- Hello, stranger!
- Hi!

222
00:14:24,538 --> 00:14:28,108
- So, finally you come back, huh?
- Yes. How are you guys?

223
00:14:28,109 --> 00:14:30,873
- Good.
- Molto bene, grazie. Pretty much the same.

224
00:14:30,874 --> 00:14:33,829
- He's still sunburnt.
- Oi! That's a healthy colour, that.

225
00:14:33,830 --> 00:14:37,785
- And you guys are still together?
- Yeah, of course. Nothing changes.

226
00:14:37,786 --> 00:14:40,972
Yeah, but not everything
is the same, you know?

- Your...

00:17:02,477 --> 00:17:05,209
What do you think?
A bit too gorgeous, isn't he?

264
00:17:06,586 --> 00:17:10,655

- Yeah. Do you guys know each other?

- No! Hi, I'm Taylor, Maddie's sister.

266
00:17:21,216 --> 00:17:23,289
She... she's your sister?

267

Yeah. Can't you see it?

268
00:17:26,746 --> 00:17:29,675
T and I are like peas in a pod.

What is that?

270
00:17:33,005 --> 00:17:34,743
T is for Taylor.

271
00:17:37,498 --> 00:17:40,261
- T is for Taylor.
- What? Do you know these guys?

272
00:17:40,262 --> 00:17:44,639
No! Hi, I'm Taylor. Nice to
meet you. Hi, how are you?

273
00:17:44,640 --> 00:17:48,018
They're normally much friendlier
than this. Guys, it's my sister.

274
00:17:48,019 --> 00:17:52,012
- Ah-ha! Well, welcome to Puglia, Taylor.
- (ENRICO) Taylor, hi.

275
00:17:52,013 --> 00:17:54,201
Oh, so that's why you're here,
for your sister's wedding.

276
00:17:54,202 --> 00:17:57,733
Yes, yes! And I am just so excited!

277
00:17:57,734 --> 00:18:00,773
I knew you'd approve once
you met him. Isn't he divine?

278
00:18:02,419 --> 00:18:06,028
Yes, er... sorry, sunstroke!

279
00:18:06,029 --> 00:18:08,217
I think I need to go and
lie down in a dark room.

280
00:18:08,218 --> 00:18:10,950
- Well, I'll come with you.
- No, no, no. I'll be fine.

281
00:18:15,091 --> 00:18:16,906
Taylor.

282
00:18:18,509 --> 00:18:21,547
Taylor! Are you all right?

283
00:18:22,042 --> 00:18:25,151
- I just don't want Maddie to know.
- But you and Raf...

284
00:18:25,152 --> 00:18:29,337
A holiday romance, years ago.
It was so totally nothing.

285
00:18:29,338 --> 00:18:32,334
It's better to just pretend it never
happened because it pretty much never did.

286
00:18:32,563 --> 00:18:35,673
OK, if you say so.

287
00:18:35,674 --> 00:18:39,017
- I'll see you at the dinner.
- Yeah.

288
00:18:47,770 --> 00:18:51,570
- (ELENA) Have you got a husband at home?
- (LIL) Several but, none of them are mine.

289
00:18:51,571 --> 00:18:54,834
No, I don't do romance,
marriage or biological clocks.

290
00:18:54,835 --> 00:18:57,023
Oh, Lil, everyone needs
a man sometimes.

291
00:18:57,024 --> 00:18:59,636
I just change the battery.

292
00:19:00,173 --> 00:19:01,987
So, Lil, what do you do?

293
00:19:02,246 --> 00:19:05,202
I write erotic fiction.

294
00:19:05,203 --> 00:19:06,585
Ooh...

295
00:19:06,586 --> 00:19:10,041
If you need any help researching,
I'd be happy to, er...

296
00:19:10,042 --> 00:19:12,921
I'm in Italy, babe. I'm not
ordering the fish and chips.

297
00:19:12,922 --> 00:19:16,265
- (MIKEY) I'm spaghetti bloody vongole!
- I can't believe they're sisters.

298
00:19:16,762 --> 00:19:19,068
Why not?

299
00:19:19,450 --> 00:19:23,023
Er... yeah, like,
you're just... sisters.

300
00:19:23,942 --> 00:19:25,516
What?

301
00:19:25,517 --> 00:19:28,281
Come on, Rafa, speech.

302
00:19:28,282 --> 00:19:32,937
(MIKEY) Give it up for the man
himself, mio migliore amico.

303
00:19:33,158 --> 00:19:34,732
That was beautiful, Mikey. Thank you.

304
00:19:34,733 --> 00:19:36,959
- No, you're beautiful.
- No, you're beautiful.

305
00:19:36,960 --> 00:19:39,417
I could just stare at him all day.

306
00:19:39,418 --> 00:19:41,724
Er... I'm getting married.

307
00:19:42,029 --> 00:19:43,877
- (ENRICO) Yes, Raf.
- (MIKEY) Hey!

308
00:19:45,946 --> 00:19:48,172
- (RAF) Miss Maddie.
- (MADDIE) Mm-hmm.

309
00:19:48,173 --> 00:19:52,204
My friends can tell you that I don't
really, usually, fall in love so easy.

310
00:19:52,205 --> 00:19:57,471
But... with you it was
truly love at first sight.

311
00:20:00,806 --> 00:20:02,960
What can I say?

312
00:20:04,570 --> 00:20:06,723
You're amazing.

313
00:20:07,949 --> 00:20:09,791
Passionate.

314
00:20:09,792 --> 00:20:11,289
Brave.

315
00:20:11,290 --> 00:20:14,898

- To Maddie.
- (ALL) To Maddie.

318
00:20:27,725 --> 00:20:29,452
All right, babe, your turn.

319
00:20:29,453 --> 00:20:30,527
- Oh, no, no...
- Yeah.

320
00:20:30,528 --> 00:20:32,677
OK, yes, yes, yes.

321
00:20:32,678 --> 00:20:36,863
Er... well, I know that this has come
as a bit of a surprise to some of you,

322
00:20:36,864 --> 00:20:38,821
not least to myself.

T... Mum's not with us anymore,

325
00:20:44,352 --> 00:20:48,384
but, er... well, you and Lil
are all the family I need.

326
00:20:48,653 --> 00:20:51,839
You were the one who sent me here
and I can't thank you enough

327
00:20:51,840 --> 00:20:54,420
because look what I found.

328
00:20:55,219 --> 00:20:57,945
Er... I've made a lot of
mistakes over the years,

329
00:20:57,946 --> 00:21:01,017
and, Raf, I have to be honest,
when I met you, I thought,

330
00:21:01,018 --> 00:21:02,783
"He's gonna be another
one that won't last.

331
00:21:02,784 --> 00:21:05,548
"It's just another holiday romance."

332
00:21:05,549 --> 00:21:09,618
But then suddenly I knew that some holiday
romances are meant to last forever.

Hey!

00:24:34,714 --> 00:24:37,362
Nice to see you again.
This is crazy, huh?

Yeah, but that's Maddie.
She loves a big show.

I mean, I had no idea
Maddie was your sister.

Yeah, she has been my whole life.

But if I'd known, I would never...

Thank you, and I'm
pleased you graduated.

That was what you wanted, right?
So, er... congratulations to you too.

392
00:24:59,290 --> 00:25:01,104
Thanks.

393

- OK, this is weird.
- No, it's not.

394
00:25:09,658 --> 00:25:12,306
It's the opposite of weird,
it's totally 'unweird'.

395
00:25:12,307 --> 00:25:15,039
- We gotta tell her.
- No.

396
00:25:16,531 --> 00:25:18,681
OK, maybe it is a bit weird.

397
00:25:18,682 --> 00:25:21,292
But just because it's weird for us doesn't
mean it needs to be weird for Mads.

398
00:25:21,293 --> 00:25:24,364

Oh, no, no, no.
I'm not the bride, I'm...

415
00:26:38,131 --> 00:26:40,473
It's someone else that
he's marrying. I'm no one.

416
00:26:40,474 --> 00:26:44,697
I'm just a friend. I mean,
the sister of the bride.

Perfect.

419
00:26:52,915 --> 00:26:55,587
I didn't change, Raf. I just couldn't
drop everything and run off...

420
00:26:55,589 --> 00:27:00,517
- into the sunset with you.
- Yeah, I know. Your "real life", right?

421
00:27:00,518 --> 00:27:03,513
- How's that working out for you now?
- Great!

422
00:27:03,514 --> 00:27:05,285
Cool.

423
00:27:07,277 --> 00:27:09,736
Are you seeing anyone?

424
00:27:10,042 --> 00:27:13,381
- I don't wanna talk about it.
- Oh, sorry.

425
00:27:13,382 --> 00:27:14,847
Why are you sorry?

426
00:27:16,493 --> 00:27:18,373
Well, that's a no, isn't it?

427
00:27:18,374 --> 00:27:21,906
No, actually, it's not necessarily a no.
I just don't wanna talk about it.

428
00:27:21,907 --> 00:27:25,830
I think that sort of thing is private and
doesn't need to be sung from the rooftops.

429
00:27:26,784 --> 00:27:29,471
I forgot. Never say
what you feel, right?

430
00:27:29,472 --> 00:27:32,965
I just don't see why people have to make
such a spectacle of their feelings.

431
00:27:32,966 --> 00:27:35,255
Because if someone sings
it from the rooftops,

you know that they really mean it,
and that's what weddings are all about.

fall in love with my sister?

436
00:27:50,323 --> 00:27:53,855
But how could I know she was your sister?
I never met two people less like each other.

It's a ride. It's a great,
fun, sexy rollercoaster.

467
00:29:47,366 --> 00:29:49,631
All right, maybe we've had a big
down these last few months.

468
00:29:49,632 --> 00:29:50,706
You dumped me!

469
00:29:50,707 --> 00:29:53,970
That just means we're due for
a big up. Know what I'm saying?

472
00:30:00,998 --> 00:30:03,152
I want to get off.

you go, Madison Jones.

enough to admit that.

Oh, this again!

Come on, we are incredible together.
You know that.

478

Just go!

479
00:30:18,586 --> 00:30:22,655
One more chance.
Come on, you owe me that.

480

I don't owe you anything,

you have to follow your heart.

00:38:23,040 --> 00:38:25,228
Well, slamming the door in
his face said it perfectly.

619
00:38:25,229 --> 00:38:29,183
Well, it's nicer this way. Grazie.

620
00:38:29,184 --> 00:38:32,639
- What are you doing?
- Don't worry, I can look after myself.

621
00:38:32,640 --> 00:38:35,673
When? When have you ever
been able to look after yourself?

622
00:38:35,674 --> 00:38:38,092
Like, all the time.

623
00:38:38,093 --> 00:38:40,703
Yes, I'm out there, and yes,
sometimes I make mistakes.

624
00:38:40,704 --> 00:38:42,124
You think?

625
00:38:42,125 --> 00:38:46,002
I know, Taylor, OK?
But I live with those mistakes,

626
00:38:46,003 --> 00:38:49,535
and I don't expect anyone
else to sort them out for me.

627
00:38:49,536 --> 00:38:52,338
It's better than locking your heart
away, too scared of getting hurt.

628
00:38:52,339 --> 00:38:55,564
I've lived with your mistakes.

629
00:38:55,565 --> 00:38:58,252
Where do you think I've been
for the past five years?

630
00:38:58,253 --> 00:39:03,167
And three years before that?
And 18 months before that?

631
00:39:03,168 --> 00:39:07,199
Did it ever occur to you that maybe the
reason I'm not all over guys all the time

632
00:39:07,200 --> 00:39:12,467
is because I've seen what a fool you've
made of yourself again and again and again?

633
00:39:21,216 --> 00:39:24,133
Well, I'd rather be like
that than the other way.

634
00:39:24,134 --> 00:39:26,245
And if I've made you afraid of
opening yourself up to love,

635
00:39:26,246 --> 00:39:28,552
then I'm truly sorry.

636
00:39:32,698 --> 00:39:35,080
Is that my necklace?

637
00:39:36,691 --> 00:39:39,805
Just get off my stuff, OK?

638
00:39:42,720 --> 00:39:45,253
OK, ladies, break it up. Time to go.

639
00:39:45,254 --> 00:39:47,987
- Go where?
- The tomato festival.

640
00:39:48,710 --> 00:39:50,745
- I'm not in the mood.
- That's why you're coming.

641
00:39:50,746 --> 00:39:53,509
Oh, I wish I could, but I have a
team of brilliant people coming

642
00:39:53,510 --> 00:39:55,813
to pluck, wax and tint me
to within an inch of my life.

643
00:39:55,814 --> 00:39:58,770
Well, you're excused.

644
00:39:58,771 --> 00:40:01,044
You're not.

645
00:40:01,114 --> 00:40:07,103
I like tomatoes, I really do.
But a whole festival? It sounds lame.

you've known this guy.

Do you know why?

Oh, you filthy little squirrel.

- He listens to me.
- I listen to you.

- Oh, please, you don't let me...

...those sweet little sighs
you make in your sleep.

yours in the shower.

night at the George Cinq.

I wanted marriage.

It's all my fault.

- Please, I can do this.

He was the guy, a guy.

And I didn't want to tell
you because it was nothing.

me about how I never let anyone in

I don't feel anything for him.

he doesn't want to keep secrets from you.

I didn't want to spoil everything and...
